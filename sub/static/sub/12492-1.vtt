WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:04.785
Hi, Charlie, there you are.

00:04.820 --> 00:06.689
Nine months old and
look how cute you are.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.725
And look how cute I am.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.645
It's your big sister Teddy here,

00:12.680 --> 00:14.530
And I'm making this video diary

00:14.565 --> 00:16.230
To help you survive our...

00:16.239 --> 00:18.805
Special family.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.670
Oh, hey. Looks like dad
taught you how to eat bananas.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.845
Oh, and there's mom,

00:26.880 --> 00:28.810
Looking lovelier than ever this morning.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.615
Not in the mood.

00:30.650 --> 00:33.490
Okay. I think you've had enough bananas.

00:33.525 --> 00:36.050
So we're switching to sweet peas!

00:36.060 --> 00:39.090
You're gonna love them. Look,
mommy thinks they're so yummy.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.470
Very smart. Always make
mommy try it first, okay?

00:47.505 --> 00:49.905
Oh, and there's your older brother PJ

00:49.940 --> 00:52.070
Doing today's homework at
the last minute as usual.

00:52.105 --> 00:53.972
It's not today's homework.

00:54.007 --> 00:55.840
This is yesterday's homework.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.780
There's a chance you two will be

00:58.815 --> 01:00.815
in high school together.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.650
Oh, and there's dad preparing
for another day's work.

01:03.685 --> 01:05.485
He kills bugs for a living.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.820
Honey, come on. we've been through this.

01:07.855 --> 01:09.355
I don't kill bugs.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.960
I'm a pest control specialist.

01:13.430 --> 01:15.495
Either way...

01:15.530 --> 01:17.830
So now you've met the whole family.

01:17.865 --> 01:19.165
Forgetting somebody?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.730
Gabe! no no no. I
didn't forget about you.

01:21.765 --> 01:23.605
I was just saving the best for last.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.640
Gharlie, that was your
younger older brother Gabe.

01:26.675 --> 01:29.210
You want to say something to Charlie?

01:29.245 --> 01:31.875
You ruined my life.

01:31.910 --> 01:34.395
Okay, so it's taking
Gabe a little bit longer

01:34.430 --> 01:37.190
To get used to you. You
were kind of a surprise.

01:37.225 --> 01:39.950
I thought surprises
were supposed to be good.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.160
And... cut.

01:43.290 --> 01:45.920
Okay, gang, listen up.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.780
I'm going back to work
tonight at the hospital

01:47.815 --> 01:49.630
For the first time
since Charlie was born,

01:49.665 --> 01:51.295
So I want everyone to stay at home

01:51.330 --> 01:53.330
- and help dad with the baby.
- Wait... no, mom.

01:53.365 --> 01:54.995
I'm not gonna be here tonight.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.865
I have a study date at the library.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.700
Don't you mean "studly" date...

01:58.735 --> 02:01.670
With Spencer?

02:03.240 --> 02:05.605
Oh, save it for your pillow.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.930
I'm sorry, Teddy, but you're
just gonna have to reschedule.

02:08.965 --> 02:09.215
But, dad...

02:09.250 --> 02:12.150
- Bob!
- Uh, dad's not available right now.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.550
Mom, don't take this the wrong way,

02:15.590 --> 02:17.290
But why did you guys
have to have another baby?

02:17.320 --> 02:20.390
Well, because three
kids was just too easy.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.630
Three's for quitters.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.260
And Teddy, you know
better than to schedule

02:26.270 --> 02:28.150
a study date with a boy I've never met.

02:28.185 --> 02:30.030
Come on. as dad, it's my responsibility

02:30.040 --> 02:32.470
to know every detail of my kids' lives.

02:32.505 --> 02:34.175
Oh yeah?

02:34.210 --> 02:36.005
What school do I go to?

02:36.040 --> 02:40.645
Um... the one named
after that president.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.150
Hey, you know what? I've got
to drive you kids to school.

02:43.185 --> 02:46.080
- Let's go.
- Wait, I haven't had breakfast yet.

02:46.090 --> 02:49.490
- Come on, let's go.
- Most important meal of the day

02:49.525 --> 02:51.185
- Never got it.
- Let's go!

02:51.220 --> 02:54.160
- I've gotta get you to... Roosevelt?
- Lincoln.

02:54.195 --> 02:55.830
Got it.

02:57.430 --> 02:58.960
Day's all burnt toast

02:59.000 --> 03:00.570
Running late, and dad says

03:00.600 --> 03:03.300
Has anybody seen my left shoe

03:03.340 --> 03:05.100
I close my eyes, take a bite

03:05.140 --> 03:06.770
Grab a ride, laugh out loud

03:06.810 --> 03:09.010
There it is up on the roof

03:10.410 --> 03:13.140
I've been there, I've survived

03:13.180 --> 03:16.480
So just take my advice

03:16.520 --> 03:20.080
Hang in there, baby, things are crazy

03:20.120 --> 03:22.920
But I know your future is bright

03:22.960 --> 03:24.860
Hang in there, Baby

03:24.890 --> 03:26.760
There is no maybe

03:26.790 --> 03:29.160
Eveything turns out all right

03:29.190 --> 03:31.560
Sure life is up and down

03:31.600 --> 03:35.500
But trust me, it comes back all around

03:35.530 --> 03:39.340
You're gonna love who you turn out to be

03:40.570 --> 03:43.270
Hang in there, Baby

03:43.580 --> 03:46.390
Good Luck Charlie S01E01 Study Date

03:49.550 --> 03:51.850
Bob honey, I'm leaving for work!

03:52.990 --> 03:55.790
Okay, honey, here's Charlie's schedule.

03:55.825 --> 03:57.025
It tells you when to feed her,

03:57.060 --> 03:58.890
When to change her and
when to put her down.

03:58.925 --> 04:00.555
Sweetheart, would you relax?

04:00.590 --> 04:03.090
Big daddy's got this all under control.

04:03.100 --> 04:06.830
Okay, just because that's
on your barbecue apron

04:06.865 --> 04:08.900
Doesn't make it true.

04:09.970 --> 04:13.870
Now if charlie gets fussy, her
rubber ducky will calm her down.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.740
They're all over the
place. Please be careful...

04:15.775 --> 04:17.839
- They're all over the place.
- Honey...

04:19.140 --> 04:20.880
You seem to forget I was fully involved

04:20.915 --> 04:22.867
in the raising of three kids.

04:22.902 --> 04:25.576
Oh, yeah? When's my birthday?

04:25.611 --> 04:28.250
- July 12th.
- November 23rd.

04:28.285 --> 04:30.555
Got it.

04:30.590 --> 04:33.860
Good luck, Charlie.

04:33.895 --> 04:36.160
Mwah! Bye.

04:36.195 --> 04:38.765
Bye.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.265
Hey, dad?

04:40.300 --> 04:42.530
- Yeah?
- I have a homework question.

04:42.565 --> 04:44.365
Okay, fire away.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.110
Can the average human
lick his own armpit?

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:59.850 --> 05:02.955
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.690
So what was that, like
a science question?

05:04.725 --> 05:06.320
Nope.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.965
I'll get it. I'll get it.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.770
I'll get it. Nobody else get it!

05:17.400 --> 05:18.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:19.005 --> 05:20.710
Hi!

05:21.610 --> 05:23.275
I'm Teddy's dad.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.005
Nice to meet you, sir.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.745
Uh, Spencer and I are studying

05:26.780 --> 05:30.310
- for our biology test tomorrow.
- Are you, now?

05:32.180 --> 05:35.420
Yes. yes, we are, so can
everyone please leave?

05:35.455 --> 05:37.820
Not you.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.795
- Teddy.
- Yeah?

05:40.830 --> 05:42.560
I thought your mom said no study date.

05:42.595 --> 05:44.300
Yeah, at the library.

05:44.335 --> 05:46.395
Oh, right.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.300
Okay, so then you've
talked to her about this?

05:49.335 --> 05:51.365
Of course I did.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.310
I mean, I'm... I'm pretty sure I did.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.140
It's just I talk to so
many different people

05:58.175 --> 06:00.615
about so many different things.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.850
Why is there a giant bug in your house?

06:02.885 --> 06:05.545
That, my friend,

06:05.580 --> 06:07.155
is the jerusalem cricket,

06:07.190 --> 06:09.920
Better known to the
layman as the potato bug.

06:09.955 --> 06:12.255
- I'm an exterminator.
- Here we go.

06:12.290 --> 06:15.530
Hey, have you seen my
ad on local cable...

06:15.565 --> 06:17.325
"Bob's bugs be gone"?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.630
Yeah, how do we make Bob be gone?

06:22.070 --> 06:24.370
Okay. you've got homework to do.

06:24.405 --> 06:26.670
I've got a diaper to change.

06:26.705 --> 06:29.240
Hers... not mine.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.380
I ain't that old!

06:34.480 --> 06:36.310
I'm gonna be upstairs.

06:37.850 --> 06:40.380
- Gabe... out.
- Okay, fine.

06:40.390 --> 06:43.190
But when's that hot guy getting here?

06:43.225 --> 06:45.220
Out!

06:46.660 --> 06:48.430
- Kids.
- Yeah.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.995
Oh man, I left my book at school.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.430
Oh, that's okay, we can just share mine.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.140
- Is that okay?
- Perfect.

07:02.810 --> 07:04.275
Good,

07:04.310 --> 07:07.645
Cause I'm all about the learnin'.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.380
- Let me just grab a pencil.
- Oh yeah, I might have one.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.560
I think I left my pencils at school.

07:18.595 --> 07:20.960
Me too.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.030
Ladies and gentlemen!

07:30.040 --> 07:34.210
PJ and the Vibe!

07:35.710 --> 07:39.310
Wow, sounds like you live right
next door to that weird PJ kid.

07:39.345 --> 07:42.850
Hmm. Yeah, he's not next door.

07:42.885 --> 07:45.087
He's downstairs...

07:45.122 --> 07:47.321
And he's my brother.

07:47.356 --> 07:49.520
Oh! oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

07:49.555 --> 07:51.760
Yeah, me too.

07:54.630 --> 07:56.995
Wait wait wait! stop stop!

07:57.030 --> 08:00.500
Emmett, you were supposed
to open with the downbeat.

08:00.535 --> 08:02.402
Dude, I'm percussion,

08:02.437 --> 08:04.270
Let me "percush"!

08:05.070 --> 08:08.240
For crying out loud, guys!

08:10.640 --> 08:13.140
What's up?

08:14.580 --> 08:16.615
Can you please turn it
down? We're trying to study.

08:16.650 --> 08:19.580
No can do, sis. There's only
one level in rock 'n' roll.

08:19.615 --> 08:22.985
And that is loud!

08:23.020 --> 08:25.850
Whoa whoa. I think we can
accommodate your little sister.

08:25.885 --> 08:26.920
Excuse me,

08:26.930 --> 08:29.365
But the band is called PJ and the vibe.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.800
So what, the Vibe doesn't get a say?

08:31.835 --> 08:34.870
I... I'm the vibe.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.635
Yeah, I got that.

08:37.669 --> 08:40.240
Oh, so you got my vibe, huh?

08:42.539 --> 08:45.405
I'm gonna be over here.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.880
- Turn it down now.
- You will not censor my art.

08:48.915 --> 08:51.150
I will not be silent!

08:54.120 --> 08:56.685
hey!

08:56.720 --> 08:58.125
If I have come down here again,

08:58.160 --> 08:59.820
this gets plugged into somewhere else

08:59.830 --> 09:02.130
Okay?

09:05.930 --> 09:08.550
Yo, who's she up there
studying with anyway?

09:08.585 --> 09:11.170
Is there a second
fine lady in the house?

09:11.205 --> 09:13.205
Some guy she's totally into.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.605
I can't believe she's cheating on me.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.610
She's not cheating on you.
She barely knows you exist.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.462
No, see, our relationship
is just developing slowly.

09:21.497 --> 09:24.280
- No, there is no relationship.
- Yes, there is.

09:24.315 --> 09:25.815
- No, it's all in your head!
- no,

09:25.850 --> 09:27.890
it's not, 'cause even
my mum know about it

09:30.190 --> 09:32.190
Now then, where were we?

09:36.900 --> 09:40.300
You know, actually, I think
you were a little bit closer.

09:42.370 --> 09:45.240
All right... cellular respiration.

09:52.410 --> 09:54.980
- Do you mind?
- not at all.

09:55.015 --> 09:57.980
While we're at it...

10:08.410 --> 10:11.020
- What are you doing?
- Oh! gabe!

10:11.055 --> 10:13.630
- What do you want?
- Dinner!

10:13.665 --> 10:15.265
Nobody's fed me all day!

10:15.300 --> 10:17.490
And I am still part
of this family, right?

10:17.525 --> 10:19.680
There's a half-eaten
sandwich in the fridge

10:19.715 --> 10:21.540
Knock yourself out.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.265
All right. Now my brothers
are all taken care of.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.250
- Good.
- And there will be no more interruptions.

10:31.285 --> 10:33.150
- Teddy!
- Oh, god!

10:34.850 --> 10:37.040
- What do you want?!
- I need you

10:37.075 --> 10:38.890
to watch the baby for a sec.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.900
No!

10:47.500 --> 10:49.570
No!

11:02.050 --> 11:04.400
Nobody tells mom!

11:04.435 --> 11:06.750
Come here, Charlie.

11:06.785 --> 11:08.215
Oh, yes.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.460
- Charlie's fine.
- Ooh! But I'm not.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.125
Uh, Teddy,

11:14.160 --> 11:15.880
Tell PJ to fire up the bug truck,

11:15.915 --> 11:17.565
I think I gotta go to the hospital.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.900
Oh, and Teddy, you're gonna
have to watch the baby.

11:20.935 --> 11:24.240
No! Okay.

11:32.010 --> 11:33.830
Relax, be the hospital in 10 mintues

11:33.865 --> 11:36.617
Okay, just please please hurry.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.370
Oh, wow! My butt is on fire!

11:39.405 --> 11:41.465
That is so weird!

11:41.500 --> 11:43.540
Last week, Emmett and I wrote a song

11:43.575 --> 11:45.005
With that exact same title.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.570
That's great, son. just
please don't sing...

11:46.580 --> 11:48.840
- My butt is on fire!?
- Stop it.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.410
It's the size of a tire!

11:52.445 --> 11:54.180
Stop it!

11:56.520 --> 11:58.750
- Punch buggy!
- Ow! What are you doing?!

11:58.785 --> 12:00.920
Could you drive, please?!

12:02.260 --> 12:05.430
- Hey, you want to play license plate game?
- No!

12:10.730 --> 12:13.230
Michigan.

12:17.910 --> 12:20.470
- Maybe I should go.
- no!

12:20.480 --> 12:22.530
Um, she's almost done with bottle

12:22.565 --> 12:24.787
And then she'll go right to sleep.

12:24.822 --> 12:27.010
Then we can studly... I mean study.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.350
Now, uh, where were we?

12:33.690 --> 12:36.555
Okay.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.225
- Yeah.
- What is cellular respiration?

12:39.260 --> 12:41.310
That's when glucose and other compounds

12:41.345 --> 12:43.360
oxidize to produce chemical energy,

12:43.370 --> 12:45.770
- water and carbon
dioxide. - Mm-hmm.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.970
Also known as poop.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.745
Oh, boy.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.520
Hang in there, dad.

13:03.290 --> 13:08.290
Wow! Butt fire spreading.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.010
- Where's the doctor?
- I'll go see.

13:12.045 --> 13:13.795
Okay, wait wait wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.800
Wait. wait. We don't want
mom to know we're here, right?

13:16.835 --> 13:19.137
So please be careful.

13:19.172 --> 13:21.440
Just try and blend in.

13:21.475 --> 13:23.205
Dad, come on.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.010
It's hard for this to blend in.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.480
Just figure something out.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.110
"figure something out."

13:34.120 --> 13:36.620
"figure something out."

13:45.290 --> 13:47.560
Mom!

13:51.030 --> 13:52.700
You're the doctor?

13:55.470 --> 13:57.105
Yes.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.705
I am.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.770
I am doctor...

14:00.780 --> 14:03.540
Shh... Chandrasooleewan.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.650
- Are you Indian?
- We prefer to be called Native American.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.790
Are you sure you're a real doctor?

14:13.825 --> 14:15.777
You look kinda young.

14:15.812 --> 14:17.730
You sound like my wife.

14:19.790 --> 14:23.100
Okay, uh...

14:25.270 --> 14:27.635
What seems to be the problem?

14:27.670 --> 14:30.000
I have a fish hook in my lip!

14:30.010 --> 14:35.040
- How'd this happen?
- My dad is not a very good fisherman.

14:36.510 --> 14:40.080
Hey, mine's not a very good
walking-down-the-stairs man.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.655
So...

14:44.690 --> 14:48.190
I'm guessing you're a 97-pounder.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.030
Hush, little baby

14:53.065 --> 14:54.965
Go beddy-bye

14:55.000 --> 14:59.230
Teddy wants to kiss a really cute guy.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.535
How's it going?

15:02.570 --> 15:05.610
Well, we're getting there.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.305
Well well well. What have we here?

15:18.340 --> 15:20.455
Emmett, why are you still here?

15:20.490 --> 15:22.685
Well, I was looking for the kitchen,

15:22.720 --> 15:26.160
But I seem to have
stumbled upon the ballroom.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.640
- hello?
- Teddy, it's Mrs Dabney from next door.

15:34.675 --> 15:37.100
No, I have not seen your cat.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.605
I'm calling about your brother;

15:38.640 --> 15:40.470
He's eating me out of house and home

15:40.480 --> 15:44.110
Gabe! Step away from the pie!

15:46.210 --> 15:47.745
Okay, I'll be right there.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.820
All right. spencer, I'll
be back in like two minutes.

15:49.855 --> 15:53.120
Don't go anywhere. emmett, go somewhere.

15:57.330 --> 15:58.980
So what do you think you're
doing with my girlfriend?

15:59.015 --> 16:00.495
She's not your girlfriend

16:00.530 --> 16:02.830
Okay, maybe me and you
need to step outside...

16:03.970 --> 16:06.530
So you can walk me to my bike.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.780
You here to give me my sponge bath?

16:21.120 --> 16:23.880
- PJ?
- Hey, mom.

16:23.890 --> 16:25.685
What are you doing here?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.190
I'll tell you what I'm not doing here...

16:28.225 --> 16:30.660
Giving sponge baths to big hairy guys.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.860
So, mom, what's... what's the happs?

16:34.895 --> 16:36.830
What's...

16:38.570 --> 16:40.300
Hey, honey!

16:41.470 --> 16:43.570
- Bob!
- Nice work, son.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.605
Okay, what's going on here?

16:46.640 --> 16:49.345
Dad fell down the stairs
and broke his butt.

16:49.380 --> 16:53.050
- You weren't holding the baby, were you?
- Um, yes...

16:53.085 --> 16:55.685
Then no, then yes again.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.790
Bob, you promised me you
weren't gonna drop this one!

17:01.020 --> 17:02.955
Honey, look, it was
just a little accident.

17:02.990 --> 17:06.560
Oh, and by the way, for the
record... an amazing catch!

17:06.595 --> 17:08.925
I knew this was a huge mistake.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.560
I never should've gone back to work.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.869
Sweetheart, this is all gonna be okay.

17:12.905 --> 17:14.335
No. no, it's not.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.905
It's too hard. I can't do this.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.410
I mean, what made me think I
could go back to work full time

17:19.444 --> 17:21.510
and take care of four kids?

17:21.545 --> 17:23.662
I'm a terrible mother.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.744
No no, you're not.

17:25.780 --> 17:28.369
Look, if anything,
I'm a horrible father.

17:28.405 --> 17:29.620
I know!

17:30.420 --> 17:32.405
Would you guys chill?

17:32.440 --> 17:34.355
You're great parents.

17:34.390 --> 17:36.260
Teddy, gabe and me
turned out pretty good.

17:36.295 --> 17:37.725
Yeah, come on.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.595
We've got to be doing something right.

17:39.630 --> 17:42.330
I mean, hey, look at
this... our son's a doctor.

17:44.370 --> 17:47.465
I'm serious. With both of us working,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.670
Poor little Charlie
doesn't stand a chance.

17:49.705 --> 17:52.240
Come on, no one's going solo on this.

17:52.275 --> 17:54.575
All us kids are gonna help out.

17:54.610 --> 17:58.180
And if charlie gets a little
messed up along the way,

17:58.215 --> 18:00.915
We can all share the blame.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.420
Dr Chandrasooleewan
to the operating room.

18:03.455 --> 18:05.420
It never ends!

18:10.990 --> 18:12.830
Gabe!

18:15.530 --> 18:17.320
Sorry about that, Mrs Dabney, but you

18:17.355 --> 18:18.935
probably shouldn't let him in.

18:18.970 --> 18:21.940
I didn't let him in. He
crawled through the cat door.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.610
Gabe, is there something you
want to say to Mrs Dabney?

18:26.645 --> 18:28.075
Yeah.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.940
What are you fixing tomorrow night?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.445
The cat door.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.400
Gonna make sure it's locked.

18:35.435 --> 18:37.462
Okay. I think we're done here.

18:37.497 --> 18:39.490
- Good night.
- It is now.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.590
All right, let's go.

18:46.730 --> 18:49.815
- What are you doing?
- Oh, so now you're suddenly

18:49.850 --> 18:52.900
- interested in me?
- gabe, you're my little brother.

18:52.935 --> 18:54.800
I've never been interested in you.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.870
I'm kidding.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.675
What's going on?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.595
Ever since the baby arrived,

19:05.630 --> 19:07.805
Everyone's been ignoring me.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.980
I feel like I'm invisible.

19:12.950 --> 19:15.190
I'm just the loser middle kid...

19:15.225 --> 19:17.220
Like you.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.860
Just because I'm a middle
kid doesn't make me a loser.

19:19.895 --> 19:22.600
Then what does make you a loser?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.970
I am not a loser. Okay?

19:26.005 --> 19:27.922
And I was a baby once.

19:27.957 --> 19:29.805
And then you came along.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.505
And I was not happy about it.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.310
But then you peed on PJ and I thought,

19:34.345 --> 19:36.040
"Hey, give the kid a shot."

19:37.510 --> 19:39.050
Look, someday you're
gonna feel the same way

19:39.085 --> 19:40.850
a bout Charlie that I feel about you.

19:40.885 --> 19:44.450
Well, how do you feel about me?

19:44.485 --> 19:46.085
Let's put it this way...

19:46.120 --> 19:49.090
The hottest guy in school
is at our house right now,

19:49.125 --> 19:50.920
And I'm here with you.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.530
Look how cute she is.

20:02.570 --> 20:04.810
I am warming up to her already!

20:09.310 --> 20:12.510
Okay, Charlie's asleep,
Gabe's playing a video game

20:12.545 --> 20:15.780
And we are finally alone.

20:19.790 --> 20:22.320
Hey, everybody!

20:23.320 --> 20:26.790
I have a bruised coccyx.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.965
Oh, come on!

20:31.000 --> 20:33.600
That's a funny word.

20:33.635 --> 20:36.335
Coccyx!

20:36.370 --> 20:38.840
The doctor gave him pain medication.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.775
Was that me? Sorry.

20:42.810 --> 20:45.380
I'm a little numb down there.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.950
Uh, actually, that's my ride.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.680
Of course it is.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.590
It's good to meet you, son.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.960
Oh, good night, sweetheart.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.900
Good night, sir.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.040
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.880
Coccyx!

21:28.560 --> 21:31.125
So that's how dad got my first kiss

21:31.160 --> 21:33.690
And how you flew for the first time.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.725
But the good news is...

21:35.760 --> 21:37.460
Nah, there is no good news.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.455
I take that back! It's
a text from spencer!

21:42.490 --> 21:44.810
He wants to hang out
with me tomorrow night

21:44.845 --> 21:46.835
At his house!

21:46.870 --> 21:49.710
Oh! I've gotta go wash
your puke out of my jacket.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.515
Oh, and, uh, one more thing...

21:53.550 --> 21:56.250
When you're my age and
you meet a cute boy,

21:56.285 --> 21:58.850
Do not, under any circumstances,

21:58.885 --> 22:01.722
ever ever bring him home.

22:01.757 --> 22:04.308
Cause if you do, well...

22:04.343 --> 22:06.860
Good luck, Charlie.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.085
Oh, that's wonderful.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.385
Thank you so much for doing this.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.660
Hey, if I can't be
there for my patients,

22:19.695 --> 22:22.430
What kind of pretend doctor am I?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.930
So, uh, do you ever
think about shaving...

22:30.940 --> 22:33.940
Like, everywhere?

22:35.170 --> 22:37.770
I did... last week.
