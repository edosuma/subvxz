00:00.510 --> 00:03.069
***

00:03.070 --> 00:04.720
we consult with experts.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.070
We take every precaution and

00:06.071 --> 00:08.890
we have years of experience
in doing row situations.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.259
On this episode of
"Mythbusters" --

00:13.260 --> 00:14.439
amazing.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.620
Strap yourselves in for
another duct tape-tacular.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.119
***

00:20.120 --> 00:22.900
Adam and Jamie are
stretched to the limit

00:23.390 --> 00:25.250
and taken to the brink

00:26.060 --> 00:28.269
as they try to cross a chasm

00:28.270 --> 00:28.880
***

00:28.881 --> 00:31.279
on a bridge made of duct tape.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.759
All for the glory.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.309
Meanwhile, Kari, Grant and
Tory are hitting the road.

00:37.310 --> 00:38.989
What took you so long.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.679
To find out if duct
tape can keep a car

00:41.680 --> 00:43.179
from going to pieces.

00:43.180 --> 00:44.489
She's a mad woman!

00:44.490 --> 00:46.709
Then it's a race
to the finish line

00:46.710 --> 00:47.619
***

00:47.620 --> 00:49.559
to see if the sticky stuff

00:49.560 --> 00:50.749
***

00:50.750 --> 00:54.320
can stop a speeding
car in its tracks.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.370
Who are the "Mythbusters"?

00:59.510 --> 01:00.759
Adam savage.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.179
***

01:02.180 --> 01:03.799
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.679
I call it my pop gun.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.690
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.639
Joining them, Kari Byron,

01:12.640 --> 01:14.100
***

01:15.120 --> 01:16.629
Tory Belleci

01:16.630 --> 01:18.349
***

01:18.350 --> 01:19.659
and Grant Imahara.

01:19.660 --> 01:20.450
***

01:20.930 --> 01:22.910
they don't just tell it.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.490
They put them to the test.

01:27.890 --> 01:32.360
Mythbusters

01:34.540 --> 01:35.520
oh, no.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.780
Oh, yes.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.650
That can only mean one thing.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.270
Yes, it can.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.729
It means back by popular demand,

01:42.730 --> 01:45.920
time for the duct
tape special number 2.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.839
It was one of our
most popular shows.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.999
I'm giving it all
we've got, Captain.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.990
When the "Mythbusters"
paid homage to

01:53.991 --> 01:56.740
duct tape, fans
went into a frenzy.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.259
***

02:00.260 --> 02:01.730
because you asked for it,

02:01.800 --> 02:04.209
they're putting
more duct tape tales

02:04.210 --> 02:05.769
to the ultimate test.

02:05.770 --> 02:06.790
Oh, it's for real.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.580
***

02:10.770 --> 02:12.050
so what do you have in mind?

02:12.051 --> 02:15.089
I see in my mind EEG eye

02:15.090 --> 02:20.600
a chasm, wide and deep,
spanned only by duct tape.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.000
A duct tape bridge?

02:22.001 --> 02:24.909
That you and I can walk across.

02:24.910 --> 02:25.690
Sounds dangerous.

02:25.691 --> 02:26.900
Exactly!

02:27.530 --> 02:29.769
A duct tape ding Hi's one thing

02:29.770 --> 02:33.010
but replacing steel and stone

02:33.490 --> 02:37.679
in the tape's magical adhesive
and load g incapabilities

02:37.680 --> 02:41.270
are about btctosttog d
thesthe ultimate limit

02:41.780 --> 02:44.400
but we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.169
***

02:47.170 --> 02:49.160
I think we should run
duct tape through

02:49.161 --> 02:50.709
the paces in the shop downstairs,

02:50.710 --> 02:53.520
a series of bench
tests, if you will.

02:53.820 --> 02:54.750
Okay.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.569
Look, obviously we are
already pretty familiar

03:00.570 --> 03:02.400
with the awesome
power of duct tape.

03:02.401 --> 03:04.719
But if we're going to
make a bridge out of

03:04.720 --> 03:06.440
this stuff that safely su
spends us above a chasm,

03:06.441 --> 03:08.970
we have to determine a couple
of things right up front.

03:09.130 --> 03:12.439
One, how much do we need
to support our body weight?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.679
Two, how will we
anchor the duct tape

03:15.680 --> 03:17.010
to the sides of the chasm?

03:17.011 --> 03:19.220
That's with we're about
to test and figure out.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.550
So where do you want to begin?

03:24.551 --> 03:26.919
Let' say we stretch
out a single strand

03:26.920 --> 03:28.390
and see what it takes to break it?

03:28.530 --> 03:29.800
Sounds good. Let's do it.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.280
Step one, a single
strand strength test.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.629
The role will be played
by a digital force gauge.

03:37.630 --> 03:40.699
I will pull on the
duct tape with the hook

03:40.700 --> 03:42.819
and it will tell me how
many pounds of force

03:42.820 --> 03:44.330
it takes before it breaks.

03:47.300 --> 03:51.270
10, 12, 13. Killing me.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.060
T I don'hemean it's hurting.
Just the anticipation.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.220
63.

03:57.380 --> 03:58.729
Oh!

03:58.730 --> 04:02.220
67.3 pounds of force to break it.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.949
Wow. That's more than
I would have thought.

04:04.950 --> 04:05.800
Me, too.

04:06.450 --> 04:09.959
They might be well acquainted
with duct tape's awesome qualities

04:09.960 --> 04:12.830
but it still has the
power to surprise.

04:13.010 --> 04:14.160
I didn't realize

04:14.161 --> 04:16.279
the duct tape was going
to be that strong.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.399
That means that we could, in fact,

04:19.399 --> 04:21.839
build a bridge in theory

04:21.839 --> 04:23.009
with, like,

04:23.010 --> 04:25.910
three or four strips of
duct tape and nothing else.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.220
Huh.

04:27.221 --> 04:28.849
That little laugh means

04:28.850 --> 04:32.700
Jamie's already plotting to
put that theory to the test.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.759
I want to stretch four
across and sit on it.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.090
-And sit on it?
-Yeah.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.119
Okay.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.769
One strand snaps at 67 pounds

04:41.770 --> 04:46.030
so 4 strands should hold a
180-pound Hyneman. Right?

04:46.350 --> 04:47.740
You ready to sit on this?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.549
I am.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.570
All right. Go for it.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.130
Slow down. Slow down.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.270
So you're hanging.

04:57.271 --> 04:58.349
I am.

04:58.350 --> 05:00.159
I would say I'm off the ground.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.980
That's pretty stunning.

05:02.310 --> 05:03.320
With a combined

05:03.321 --> 05:06.690
load bearing capacity
of more than 260 pounds,

05:06.890 --> 05:09.289
the four strands support Jamie.

05:09.290 --> 05:12.279
But they're drooping
more than his mustache.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.699
You droppin o6 et30fer t.Veee fdo

05:14.700 --> 05:16.000
that's quite a bit.

05:16.070 --> 05:19.209
Yep. Supporting me
but I have to say

05:19.210 --> 05:22.350
four pieces of duct tape
does not a bridge make.

05:23.730 --> 05:27.259
We're now going to try a strand
of eight pieces of duct tape

05:27.260 --> 05:29.080
and see if we get less droop.

05:29.420 --> 05:33.129
Will adding more tape
help the droop factor?

05:33.130 --> 05:34.939
***

05:34.940 --> 05:35.790
I'm ready.

05:36.310 --> 05:38.720
With Jamie sitting
pretty on the porch,

05:38.890 --> 05:41.459
Adam runs a tape over the tape

05:41.460 --> 05:43.219
and the good news isn't good.

05:43.220 --> 05:45.749
Four feet of droop instead
of five feet of droop.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.049
You would think that

05:47.050 --> 05:49.919
the doubles of the quantity
of duct tape would,

05:49.920 --> 05:53.329
what, cut the amount of
droop in half but it didn't.

05:53.330 --> 05:55.809
Hopes of a successful
bridge are saggy

05:55.810 --> 05:57.839
until Adam lays on an idea.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.439
***

06:01.440 --> 06:03.599
then weaves a little magic.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.800
I'm trying to tease out

06:04.801 --> 06:06.609
structural qualities in duct

06:06.610 --> 06:09.209
tape to eventually yield for me

06:09.210 --> 06:12.210
-- this is my goal, a bridge
that I can actually walk on.

06:12.430 --> 06:15.959
It seems they might have
finally found their footing.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.389
It doesn't feel that bad.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.280
Do you want to try it?

06:19.650 --> 06:20.540
No. I can see.

06:20.541 --> 06:23.889
With the weight distributed
across all five strands,

06:23.890 --> 06:26.680
the extreme sag might be solved.

06:26.950 --> 06:27.810
Looks good.

06:27.811 --> 06:30.079
With handrails, you
could walk across.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.670
With five, you have a
good safety factor.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.620
This stuff is amazing.

06:35.130 --> 06:37.580
We might be able to build
a bridge out of this.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.150
I think you're right.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.650
Look, ma. No hands.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.280
***

06:47.730 --> 06:50.179
so last time we built a
cannon out of duct tape.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.400
What are we doing with this time?

06:51.401 --> 06:55.279
***

06:55.280 --> 06:58.680
there's one more very important tool
to be carrying along in the car.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.819
Duct tape. Yeah, sure.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.690
If you get into a
minor fender bender,

07:02.691 --> 07:05.249
you could hold things together
until you goat the mechanic.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.030
Exactly.

07:06.031 --> 07:09.129
I hate to ruin your party
but that's not a myth.

07:09.130 --> 07:09.820
That works.

07:09.821 --> 07:12.219
I have used duct tape to
fix my car in the past.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.699
I think the myth
lies in the extreme.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.689
Just what are you getting at?

07:16.690 --> 07:18.770
I have some action
plans for you guys.

07:21.450 --> 07:22.699
Everyone knows

07:22.700 --> 07:26.639
a few strips of duct tape can
mend a minor automotive mishap.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.520
But can it cure the most
extreme car catastrophe?

07:32.620 --> 07:35.019
I have a plan. I'll
tear apart a car

07:35.020 --> 07:37.059
and see if you can put it
back together with duct tape.

07:37.060 --> 07:37.960
Good plan.

07:37.961 --> 07:39.559
Sounds like a challenge to me.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.110
Oh, you don't even know.

07:41.810 --> 07:45.160
Putting the car back together
is only part of the challenge.

07:45.350 --> 07:49.180
It will also have to stay
in one piece at top speed.

07:50.190 --> 07:56.179
And so yet another unfortunate
automobile enters the driveway of doom.

07:56.180 --> 07:57.179
All right.

07:57.180 --> 07:59.250
Time to wreck this car.

08:00.340 --> 08:04.649
This little adventure is really
going to put duct tape to the test.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.969
The boys are going to have to put this
car back together after I destroy it.

08:07.970 --> 08:10.329
Now, they think it will be easy.

08:10.330 --> 08:13.700
I think they're underestimating
my destructive powers.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.889
To really test the tape,

08:15.890 --> 08:18.809
she wants that car in as
many pieces as possible

08:18.810 --> 08:22.329
and has developed a disturbing
appetite for destruction.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.699
I love destroying cars.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.569
Breaking glass.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.469
Crunching metal.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.039
Awesome.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.269
But when it comes
to raising the roof,

08:33.270 --> 08:36.360
even Kari's dark side is defeated.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.198
There's tools made for this.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.600
I think I have some
friends that could help.

08:44.470 --> 08:45.669
***

08:45.670 --> 08:48.479
cue a crew of San Fran's finest

08:48.480 --> 08:52.679
ready and willing to help Kari to
complete the deranged dismantling.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.700
Just in time.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.190
That is awesome.

08:57.460 --> 08:58.989
What is that?

08:58.990 --> 09:01.059
These are hydraulic cutting tools

09:01.060 --> 09:03.099
and that is cutter
spreader combination.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.619
These are cutters and use
them to cut apart the vehicle.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.599
The tools are designed to
quickly open up vehicles

09:09.600 --> 09:11.669
and free accident victims.

09:11.670 --> 09:13.879
This makes my tools look silly.

Whoo! I love it.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.829
Thank you, guys, so much.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.669
This is really going
to ruin their day.

09:28.670 --> 09:29.740
Great.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.029
Bye, guys. Bye.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.480
***

09:34.490 --> 09:42.130
it took me a sledge hammerr, sa

09:42.900 --> 09:45.989
tape to put it back together.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.369
Boys!

Hah hah hah hah!

Os car.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
Convertible now.

09:55.910 --> 09:57.410
Here are your tools.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.779
That is an impressive amount

10:03.780 --> 10:05.329
eard oduct o this

10:05.330 --> 10:09.019
tapesed to, like, you

10:09.020 --> 10:13.859
know, tapen mper or fix a hose

10:13.860 --> 10:16.830
but you know know, w not all nce.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.029
They're in a sticky situation.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.609
Kari's done her job real wel

10:21.610 --> 10:24.099
she cut key structural
points in the car.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.709
It is important to
get it straight.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.859
Aa

10:27.860 --> 10:29.589
this holds the doors on.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.699
The roof on top and keep
the windshield in place.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.360
This is where the duct tape
will have to prove itself.

10:35.770 --> 10:39.359
Soon the air is filled with the
sound of ripping duct tape.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.559
Aa

10:42.560 --> 10:44.619
duct tape is essentially
made of three layers.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.360
Vinyl layer on the
outside to contribute

10:46.361 --> 10:48.289
to the water proofing qualities.

10:48.290 --> 10:51.129
The fabric structure to
give it the core strength

10:51.130 --> 10:54.199
and a natural rubber
pressure sensitive adhesive.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.709
Generally comes in black or
silver and about 1 7/8 inches.

10:58.710 --> 11:00.369
Aa

11:00.370 --> 11:03.949
it can be duck tape, hurricane
tape, gaffer's tape,

11:03.950 --> 11:06.589
tank tape and rigger's tape.

11:06.590 --> 11:08.810
This is just part of the team.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.319
The cut up car is
coming back the life

11:14.320 --> 11:16.169
much to Kari's surprise.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.750
I can't believe how quickly
you're getting this car together.

11:20.740 --> 11:23.339
Just wait. We have made
a few improvements.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.469
Is that a window from the door?

11:25.470 --> 11:26.300
Yep.

11:26.660 --> 11:27.920
Don't drive too fast.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.529
With the redo complete,

11:29.530 --> 11:31.870
Kari can't hide her admiration.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.869
I'm going to drive this car

11:33.870 --> 11:36.979
to give the duct tape
car a spruce up.***a

11:36.980 --> 11:39.869
now the guys if they drive
will drive gingerly.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.249
Aa

11:41.250 --> 11:43.060
they don't want to see
the doors fall off.

11:43.061 --> 11:44.459
Aa

11:44.460 --> 11:47.019
***

11:47.020 --> 11:49.499
and I want to see things fly.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.249
Later, the highs and
lows of a bouncy bridge.

11:53.250 --> 11:57.240
And next, can Kari demolish
the duct taped car?

12:00.830 --> 12:03.430
Aa

12:04.440 --> 12:09.449
Kari, Tory and Grant's duct tape car
fix is ready for the ultimate test.

12:09.450 --> 12:11.189
Sorry. I might have got
a little carried away.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.139
Hey now.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.530
And so it's off to a place

12:13.531 --> 12:17.739
where the "mythbusters" performed
many crimes against inanity.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.129
What took you so long?

12:19.130 --> 12:20.709
What we'll do ***

12:20.710 --> 12:23.049
is set up a course at
the alameda runway.

12:23.050 --> 12:26.839
Start! Go through a
little "s" curve,

12:26.840 --> 12:33.889
turn, hair pin turn and then
through a bump, a bump, a bump.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.799
And a really tight turn.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.949
The idea here is
to subject the car

12:37.950 --> 12:41.590
to as much stress as possible
in the form of g force.

12:43.920 --> 12:48.410
This is duct tape car on the
duct tape classic grand prix.

12:48.470 --> 12:49.740
Lap one. Go ahead.

12:50.690 --> 12:51.570
Okay. Here we go.

12:51.610 --> 12:54.209
Car number 17 with
Byron at the wheel.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.179
Into turn number one.Come on!

12:56.180 --> 13:00.139
Kari drives as though the accelerator
is duct taped to the floor.

13:00.140 --> 13:02.959
Now into turn number three.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.480
Too much turn.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.659
Through the crazy cornering,

13:06.660 --> 13:10.049
the car is subjected
to tremendous g force.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.190
Over the bump. And
back to the beginning.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.250
We're going to die.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.729
Okay. Lap number four.

13:18.730 --> 13:21.340
Go, go, go, go!

13:21.790 --> 13:24.969
I got to say right now, the
car is looking perfect.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.559
That's five laps so far.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.580
You are looking great.

13:27.610 --> 13:29.770
Even your hood detail is still on.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.850
Kari's doing between 40
and 60 miles per hour.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.640
In a car with no
structural integrity.

13:38.770 --> 13:41.130
Everything from the
roof to the doors

13:41.200 --> 13:43.700
is being held on only by tape.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.180
One wheel in the air.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.040
Take it easy there, Kari.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.880
Last lap.

13:53.010 --> 13:54.490
And for the checkered flag.

13:54.620 --> 13:55.810
You would think I would have --

13:55.870 --> 13:57.190
it's a duct tape classic.

13:59.100 --> 13:59.980
What do you know?

14:00.020 --> 14:02.710
The duct tape car has
stayed the course.

14:03.530 --> 14:04.880
All right.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.840
That was ten laps.

14:08.330 --> 14:11.330
Whoo! You know what?
It actually made it.

14:11.390 --> 14:12.730
We survived.

14:13.130 --> 14:18.450
Hair pin turns, "s" turns,
sandbags, I took air.

14:18.510 --> 14:21.330
Still, duct tape is holding up.

14:21.370 --> 14:22.760
That was on flat ground.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.940
Now it is time to take
it to the next level.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.750
We are sending it off road.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.500
And in addition, it looks
like it's going to rain.

14:31.020 --> 14:31.950
Okay. Let's go.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.359
Maybe getting off the beaten track

14:35.360 --> 14:37.330
will bring this myth unstuck.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.080
Mad Maxine floors it.

14:40.470 --> 14:42.090
Over there. In the brush.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.579
After several soggy minutes,
thumping and bumping,

14:53.580 --> 14:56.840
this duct tape myth
suddenly stalls.

14:56.850 --> 14:57.980
Car's dead.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.690
Only on "mhb,"usters everyone's
worried about the duct tape

15:03.760 --> 15:06.500
but the only thing that's
busted is the engine.

15:06.870 --> 15:08.440
The tape hasn't budged.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.730
G force alone should have
torn that thing apart.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.629
The mood ornament
did not fall off.

15:13.630 --> 15:17.229
I have to say, I think we have
to call this one confirmed.

15:17.230 --> 15:19.239
Absolutely confirmed!

15:19.240 --> 15:20.680
Totally confirmed.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.660
Aa

15:30.750 --> 15:33.549
Jamie and Adam have worked
out the amount of duct tape

15:33.550 --> 15:35.459
they'll need to build a bridge

15:35.460 --> 15:37.569
but before they decide on a design

15:37.570 --> 15:41.189
they need to know exactly what
space they'll be spanning.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.669
This is our chasm.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.469
108 feet from this
wall to that wall.

15:45.470 --> 15:48.730
It is this distance
that we have to span.

15:49.050 --> 15:53.169
This 50-foot drop e last
featured in the seesaw saga

15:53.170 --> 15:56.260
when it became the launching
pad for a little girl.

16:03.910 --> 16:07.240
After sizing up the gap --

16:07.300 --> 16:12.530
-inside is 104 and 2 inches.
-Awesome.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.000
They return to base
for the plan to span.

16:16.590 --> 16:17.420
All right.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.040
How do you want to do this thing?

16:19.210 --> 16:22.070
Well, I figured this is
basically a rope bridge

16:22.100 --> 16:24.360
so let's make a bunch of
rope out of duct tape.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.090
Okay. I could see that.

16:26.130 --> 16:31.120
We make ropey strands and bind
them together to make the floor

16:31.190 --> 16:32.440
and then, you know,

16:32.490 --> 16:35.490
another couple of probably
thick strands for a railing.

16:35.530 --> 16:36.970
That would actually
be pretty stable.

16:37.040 --> 16:42.650
And then we could have some big ones along
the side stretched to make it stable.

16:43.090 --> 16:46.700
The small-scale test showed
five strands of duct tape

16:46.850 --> 16:51.229
eight layers thick can support
their weight without major droop

16:51.230 --> 16:55.470
but to be safe they'll make
the walkway ten strands thick.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.380
Adam's anxious.***a

16:58.430 --> 17:00.510
I'm about to construct
what I hope will be

17:00.550 --> 17:04.410
the ultimate automatic
duct taping machine.

17:04.890 --> 17:05.720
Look out.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.260
Adam's just itching to invent.

17:08.839 --> 17:13.470
Step one, another cylinders which
fit together Russian doll style.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.569
Attached to a metal strut.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.250
Okay.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.310
Which is welded to
a support frame.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.510
Looking great.

17:22.569 --> 17:26.800
Add duct tape and
behold the duct-o-matic

17:26.849 --> 17:29.510
dispensing ten strands
simultaneously.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.890
***a duct tape cable.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.870
At this point, I trust
my life to that.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.290
I can't wait to
show this to Jamie.

17:38.930 --> 17:41.600
He's going to be like, well,
it's a little over elaborate.

17:42.110 --> 17:43.390
Don't you think?

17:43.520 --> 17:44.330
Check it out.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.750
My ten-roll single pull
duct tape cable maker.

17:48.310 --> 17:49.400
That seems to work.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.560
I mean a lot of different
ways you could do it

17:51.630 --> 17:54.230
but six one half a
dozen the other, huh?

17:54.300 --> 17:55.070
Yeah.

17:56.540 --> 18:00.540
With Adam basking in Jamie's
effusive admiration,

18:00.700 --> 18:02.890
they measure out the
required distance.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.420
Okay. That's 104
feet to right here.

18:05.540 --> 18:09.970
And get down to some serious bridge
building starting with the floor.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.980
Like we're making the
world's biggest sweater.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.450
Hold on. Slow down.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.230
That's a workout.

18:26.470 --> 18:27.430
That's number five.

18:27.470 --> 18:28.600
Let's bind them together.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.860
Those five strands,

18:30.900 --> 18:35.890
each one ten layers thick are stuck
together to form a narrow walkway.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.450
It may not look like much

18:38.100 --> 18:39.670
but it just might save my life.

18:42.010 --> 18:46.000
Next, Jamie produces a pair
of handrails with a Twist.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.280
Perfect.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.970
The rope-like cable should
give them a good grip.

18:50.010 --> 18:53.470
I like the way it seems
kind of nice to hold on to.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.040
Yeah. I totally agree.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.990
That's ten strands.

18:58.550 --> 18:59.570
With the walkway,

18:59.620 --> 19:03.220
handrails and stabilizing rails
complete, they're all set.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.010
That's the great thing
about a duct tape bridge.

19:07.060 --> 19:08.410
It's so portable.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.570
Just fold and roll.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.340
That's not bad.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.760
Should we go build
a bridge with it?

19:12.870 --> 19:13.560
I think so.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.420
Okay.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.030
***

19:19.700 --> 19:22.890
it is the "mythbusters"
second duct tape special.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.700
All right. Kari, why
do you look so happy?

19:27.701 --> 19:29.879
I love the next myth.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.090
And what is that?

19:31.091 --> 19:33.149
This is sent in by
tons of viewers.

19:33.150 --> 19:36.329
It is that you can stop a
car using only duct tape.

19:36.330 --> 19:37.419
What?

19:37.420 --> 19:39.689
Video two parts to the myth.

19:39.690 --> 19:42.379
The first one is based
on a practical joke

19:42.380 --> 19:46.459
that you can duct tape a car to a
telephone pole and won't go anywhere.

19:46.460 --> 19:50.409
Technically not stopping a car
but preventing it from movie.

19:50.410 --> 19:51.260
Technically.

19:51.261 --> 19:53.759
The second part is stopping a car.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.089
It is that you can use
one roll of duct tape,

19:56.090 --> 19:59.909
build a barrier and catch a
car going 60 miles per hour.

19:59.910 --> 20:01.949
Now that one I like.

20:01.950 --> 20:02.869
Right?

20:02.870 --> 20:03.870
Right.

20:04.340 --> 20:08.269
The first part of this myth
is a prank par excellent.

20:08.270 --> 20:11.989
A devious dude duck tapes a
friend's car to the pole.

20:11.990 --> 20:16.169
He steps on the pedal
but can't escape.

20:16.170 --> 20:20.379
***a

20:20.380 --> 20:22.090
I think the whole point
of this is to see

20:22.091 --> 20:25.649
how to keep the car stationary
with the least amount of duct tape.

20:25.650 --> 20:29.280
All they need for this one is
a car and a convenient pole.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.200
***

20:32.650 --> 20:35.350
this is the last time
we carpool together.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.970
Thanks the Adam's earlier test,

20:38.030 --> 20:42.300
the team already knows the breaking
point of a string l strand of tape.

20:42.930 --> 20:46.200
67.3 pounds of force to break it.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.700
All they have to do is determine
the car's pulling power.

20:49.820 --> 20:53.410
And work out how much tape it
will take to counter that force.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.100
What we'll do is get
the force meter,

20:55.150 --> 20:57.480
strap it to the car and
attach it to the pole.

20:57.510 --> 20:59.230
Grant will drive forward.

20:59.270 --> 21:01.500
At the point it stops
driving forward,

21:02.390 --> 21:03.809
***a that's the force.

21:03.810 --> 21:04.929
***

21:04.930 --> 21:06.679
***

21:06.680 --> 21:07.959
ccc

21:07.960 --> 21:10.239
Max is 1,300. ***

21:21.710 --> 21:23.410
to stop it aribe viy.Wang

21:23.420 --> 21:25.380
go for 20 and see if it will work.

21:25.390 --> 21:28.609
I think the duct tape might
actually stop this car.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.799
Tory and Kari play a prank.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.479
For science, you understand.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.190
Hey, you kids. What are
you doing to my car?

21:37.210 --> 21:39.039
I have a sneaking suspicion

21:39.040 --> 21:43.859
there are prankster victims
everywhere blaming "mythbusters"

21:43.860 --> 21:45.240
for this myth being true.

21:45.241 --> 21:46.749
And so we say

21:46.750 --> 21:49.109
in the hope of pranksters paying

21:49.110 --> 21:50.260
the slightest attention,

21:50.261 --> 21:52.760
please, don't try this at home.

21:53.630 --> 21:54.440
What's this?

21:54.450 --> 21:55.839
On your head.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.840
Okay, Grant. Time
to rev up this myth.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.739
1,000 rpms.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.800
A few breaks there.

22:07.370 --> 22:10.129
It is holding the car in place.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.440
Floor it!

22:16.310 --> 22:18.279
Stopped the car with duct tape!

22:18.280 --> 22:19.450
Yes!

22:19.850 --> 22:21.339
***a

22:21.340 --> 22:23.219
***b

22:23.220 --> 22:25.620
I think it's confirmed.

22:27.670 --> 22:32.469
Just five rolls of tape were enough
to keep the car in its pole position.

22:32.470 --> 22:34.429
One strand broke. That was it.

22:34.430 --> 22:35.509
Look at that.

22:35.510 --> 22:38.049
I cannot believe this
myth is confirmed.

22:38.050 --> 22:38.880
Confirmed!

22:39.880 --> 22:41.160
Yeah!

22:41.170 --> 22:42.030
Confirmed!

22:42.031 --> 22:43.140
Yeah!

22:45.470 --> 22:49.080
***

22:50.090 --> 22:52.670
***

22:57.130 --> 22:58.899
ccc

22:58.900 --> 23:02.310
Adam and Jamie are rolling
out their duct tape bridge.

23:02.750 --> 23:05.180
These five strips of
duct tape are our bridge.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.890
We have walkway, two handrails
and two stabilizing rails.

23:09.330 --> 23:11.200
Why are we hooking
them up to this truck?

23:11.530 --> 23:13.660
***

23:13.740 --> 23:16.310
if it stretches it droops and

23:16.410 --> 23:20.620
we'll preassemble it up here
on the trucks and prestretch it

23:20.670 --> 23:22.450
before we put it across the span.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.870
They'll attach the walkway,

23:24.980 --> 23:29.770
handrails and ropes to
steel anchor points.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.660
T ti is o me t, melkwa

23:31.720 --> 23:34.380
they'll anchor either
end of the elbridge

23:34.430 --> 23:36.950
and help keep theuc
tape under tension.

23:37.030 --> 23:41.170
Ches thtretg ine duct tape
should prevent any sudden sag.

23:42.270 --> 23:44.930
With the bridge suspended
between the pickups,

23:45.420 --> 23:49.390
Adam and Jamie go through their
pre-walk stretching routine.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.400
I think this is going to work!

23:53.550 --> 23:56.670
Hoping to take all the
elasticity out of the duct tape

23:56.710 --> 24:00.120
before they venture out
over a 50-foot drop.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.560
Prestretching this bridge is turning out
to be a little trickier than we thought.

24:04.610 --> 24:09.070
Different components are stretching at
different rates under different loads.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.040
We're just going to do the best
we can and hope that it works.

24:13.930 --> 24:14.850
All right.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.400
When they take their
first few practice steps

24:19.720 --> 24:21.940
that's how you went to
grade school, right?

24:24.320 --> 24:25.200
I don't want to do that.

24:25.260 --> 24:26.999
It's immediately clear

24:27.000 --> 24:28.519
they're going to need more tape.

24:28.520 --> 24:31.649
I think we want to
add in some stringers

24:31.650 --> 24:34.030
between these things and the floor

24:34.450 --> 24:37.250
because you could be
like all -- dude, whoa,

24:38.620 --> 24:41.840
yeah. See? I -- whoa!

24:49.870 --> 24:51.820
This is going to be terrifying.

24:53.130 --> 24:58.150
Duct tape cross struts between the walkway
and handrails will minimize wobble.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.390
With the last-minute improvements,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.210
the bridge is ready to go.

25:03.890 --> 25:07.920
196 rolls of duct tape,
almost 400 pounds of the stuff

25:07.970 --> 25:11.700
and the bridge is pretty much
ready to string across the chasm.

25:11.880 --> 25:16.860
I marked a midpoint because in my
opinion once we pass this point

25:17.070 --> 25:18.540
I think we are home free.

25:18.610 --> 25:23.290
See, this point being the farther is where
the bridge can cause us the most trouble.

25:23.350 --> 25:26.040
It could possibly turn turtle

25:26.100 --> 25:28.280
and flip us over when we get here.

25:28.830 --> 25:33.200
Getting the preassembled bridge across
the chasm is a feat in of itself.

25:33.240 --> 25:38.550
They haul it 100 feet
to the other side

25:38.660 --> 25:42.520
and use heavy machinery
to do heavy lifting

25:42.810 --> 25:45.330
all without damaging
the duct tape.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.280
It's one thing on the ground.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.820
Quite another going it
go up across the chasm.

25:52.430 --> 25:53.270
Not many people know

25:53.300 --> 25:56.410
that Jamie has performed
surgery with a forklift.

25:57.330 --> 25:59.040
***

25:59.130 --> 26:00.090
it's beautiful

26:00.140 --> 26:02.300
Adam and Jamie g
finally bridge the gap

26:02.350 --> 26:06.120
between duct tape fantasy
and duct tape reality.

26:06.370 --> 26:07.820
You know what?
That is my my friend.

26:08.910 --> 26:09.900
That's a bridge.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.760
That is a bridge.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.490
Always a good day for us

26:19.530 --> 26:21.060
when we're able to use tools and

26:21.110 --> 26:23.820
materials in ways for which
they were never intended

26:23.920 --> 26:25.560
and duct tape bridge, well,

26:26.450 --> 26:28.720
I dare say the guy that
invented this stuff had

26:28.770 --> 26:31.960
no intent whatsoever to use
it to make bridges with.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.600
Will it work?

26:34.190 --> 26:35.870
S the'eronly one
way to find out.E'

26:37.280 --> 26:38.520
***

26:39.870 --> 26:41.990
don't try anything you
have seen on the show.

26:42.130 --> 26:44.390
We are what you call -- experts.

26:45.290 --> 26:46.190
***

26:46.850 --> 26:50.760
just five rolls of duct
tape can keep a car parked.

26:51.770 --> 26:56.680
Then, Grant, Tory and Kari want to
super size this automotive myth.

26:57.460 --> 27:01.200
How crazy is this myth to catch a
car with a single roll of duct tape?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.009
Yeah, that does seem
a little ridiculous

27:03.010 --> 27:04.789
but you saw how well it
held the car together

27:04.790 --> 27:06.650
when you were driving
around like a maniac.

27:06.651 --> 27:08.899
***

27:08.900 --> 27:10.570
versus a car going 60?

27:10.980 --> 27:12.879
I have seen crazier
things on the show.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.850
Let's do it.

27:14.650 --> 27:17.010
They're on the road again.

27:17.580 --> 27:20.940
Telephone poles are few
and far between out here.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.920
So they'll use something
a little more concrete.

27:23.970 --> 27:28.630
We're setting up k-rail in an
arrow formation for two purposes.

27:28.760 --> 27:33.090
One, it's going to hold our single
roll of duct tape car catcher

27:33.190 --> 27:37.970
as well as serve as a barrier for
anything that may go out of control.

27:38.330 --> 27:41.520
The tape is wound round
half-inch thick steel rods

27:41.570 --> 27:44.720
forming a single strand ***

27:45.200 --> 27:51.250
and then this fan fable doesn't just
look dubious but patently ridiculous

27:51.340 --> 27:52.460
and then some.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.380
Duct tape can do
that lot of things.

27:54.420 --> 27:57.830
But stopping a car at 60
miles per hour with one roll?

27:57.900 --> 27:59.020
I seriously doubt it.

27:59.090 --> 28:01.130
Ready to put your life
on the line for science?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.200
Oh, I'm ready.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.160
Do we really need helmets, though?

28:04.310 --> 28:05.070
Yes.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.480
I'm going to watch
from a safe place.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.140
I'm ready. Are you in position?

28:10.220 --> 28:11.210
Stand by.

28:12.550 --> 28:13.070
Okay.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.240
This is single roll of
duct tape on your go.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.980
Okay. Here we go.

28:17.690 --> 28:19.370
Tory hits the gas.

28:19.930 --> 28:21.720
Stop!

28:22.190 --> 28:23.830
The car hits the duct tape.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.140
And the myth hits the mcatom.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.600
Okay.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.740
So maybe you didn't
need the helmets.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.830
I didn't get up to 60 miles
per hour. That was like 40.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.070
Oh well. I can't believe it broke.

28:37.130 --> 28:37.990
Couldn't stop a car.

28:38.030 --> 28:39.450
Let's do what we do on the***a

28:39.500 --> 28:42.150
show and super size it.

28:42.210 --> 28:45.190
Yeah, but I mean, we can build a
wall ten feet thick with duct tape.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.790
Where do we draw the line?

28:47.890 --> 28:51.190
That's totally impractical.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.980
Maybe 100 rolls of duct tape.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.380
Sounds great.

28:54.470 --> 28:55.680
This is how we'll do it.

28:55.681 --> 28:57.879
We have two pipes
on either side here

28:57.880 --> 29:03.520
and wrap the duct tape around it until it's
thick enough we think it will stop the car.

29:06.430 --> 29:07.590
Back at alameda,

29:07.591 --> 29:12.729
they have a solid wall three inches
thick made from 100 rolls of duct tape.

29:12.730 --> 29:15.790
That is one thick
wall of duct tape.

29:18.630 --> 29:21.589
No one's willing to drive
into this duct tape barrier

29:21.590 --> 29:22.870
so they've got a plan.

29:23.450 --> 29:25.719
In order to get the car
to hit the barrier,

29:25.720 --> 29:26.860
we are going to tow it.

29:26.870 --> 29:28.219
Tory's made a tow bar.

29:28.220 --> 29:31.779
***

29:31.780 --> 29:35.599
now at the bottom of the
wall is a steel plate

29:35.600 --> 29:37.540
and connected to that
plate is a pulley.

29:37.541 --> 29:40.049
The tow cable goes
through the pulley

29:40.050 --> 29:42.959
so that as we tow the
car towards the barrier,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.669
it is going to want to
center right on that pulley

29:45.670 --> 29:47.179
and aim right for the wall.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.799
And just in case the
cable comes loose,

29:49.800 --> 29:53.959
the car goes awol -
how I have missed you so.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.590
Grant's brought
along an old friend.

29:57.470 --> 30:01.589
What this radio is doing is sending
a signal to the receiver on the roof

30:01.590 --> 30:04.739
to control a valve down here.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.359
The valve provides
air to the cylinder.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.650
When I turn this off,

30:10.340 --> 30:14.579
it actually takes the foot off the
brake and allows the car to roll.

30:14.580 --> 30:19.489
When I go to safe, it closes
the brake and the car stops.

30:19.490 --> 30:22.700
With the car under Grant's
control, they're good to go.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.899
Got the car right here running.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.960
The brakes are on.

30:25.970 --> 30:27.479
I just need to flip the switch

30:27.480 --> 30:30.139
and disengage the brakes
and it is ready to go.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.229
At that point, the tow vehicle
will hit the accelerator

30:33.230 --> 30:38.989
pulling the car down the track headed
straight for our wall of duct tape.

30:38.990 --> 30:40.260
Here we go, Kari.

30:40.261 --> 30:41.479
Brake is off.

30:41.480 --> 30:46.060
Ease into it. Three, two, one, go.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.330
Here it comes.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.390
The pickup picks up speed.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.000
60 miles per hour.

30:58.380 --> 31:02.380
The test car hurdles towards the
tape with duct tape destiny.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.570
At the last second --

31:06.340 --> 31:09.020
the experiment hits
a bit of a snag.

31:14.540 --> 31:19.210
Somehow the car hit everything
except the wall of duct tape.

31:19.270 --> 31:20.160
What happened?

31:20.330 --> 31:24.560
I thought I saw the tow cable
slip off of the guide bar

31:24.830 --> 31:28.100
but just a car length
before the k-rails.

31:28.260 --> 31:32.989
The cable came through so late Grant
didn't have time to hit the brakes

31:32.990 --> 31:34.819
but there is some good news.

31:34.820 --> 31:37.359
The duct tape barrier's undamaged.

31:37.360 --> 31:42.540
We are going to go back, take this
face your, figure out how to fix it,

31:42.550 --> 31:45.429
we are going to try it again
because we are not giving up here.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.469
Looking great.

31:46.470 --> 31:47.799
Right on target.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.790
Still ahead.

31:48.791 --> 31:51.010
More duct tape demolition.

31:51.020 --> 31:51.810
***

31:52.300 --> 31:55.260
***

31:55.650 --> 31:57.409
Kari, Tory and Grant want to see

31:57.410 --> 32:01.470
if a duct tape pe r barrier
can stop a speeding car.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.200
But on their first attempt,

32:03.290 --> 32:05.040
failure was the option.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.700
We lost the connection
between our tow vehicle

32:10.760 --> 32:13.650
and this vehicland veered
to the right and crashed.

32:13.690 --> 32:16.370
Now what we are going to do
is put a rope clip on there.

32:16.420 --> 32:21.440
We moved the break away line
up to the tow vehicle itself.

32:21.810 --> 32:23.780
If anything is
caught in the pulley,

32:23.850 --> 32:27.390
that cable will break away
and everybody will be safe.

32:27.890 --> 32:31.840
They're not about to let rain
dampen the quest for duct tape data.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.790
Here we go.

32:33.420 --> 32:36.430
The test car is soon
taxiing down the runway

32:36.520 --> 32:39.110
with Tory and Grant
in hot pursuit.

32:39.170 --> 32:42.390
It's got it!

32:50.230 --> 32:52.010
That was awesome!

32:52.100 --> 32:52.810
Yeah!

32:55.110 --> 32:57.489
Once again, the car
caught the k-rails

32:57.490 --> 33:00.259
but it also wiped out
the duct tape wall.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.210
Didn't it?

33:01.211 --> 33:03.139
Looks like the duct tape wall

33:03.140 --> 33:04.960
wasn't strong enough
to stop the car.

33:04.961 --> 33:06.040
Check it.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.259
Oh, no.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.519
The wall is still together.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.289
We've got a problem.

33:13.290 --> 33:15.150
It broke away from the k-rail.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.479
You know what?

33:16.480 --> 33:18.789
I think we better take a look at the
high speed and see what happened.

33:18.790 --> 33:19.700
All right.

33:19.710 --> 33:25.819
The duct tape wall stayed intact
and it ripped it out of the k-rail.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.159
I can't believe that.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.469
I mean, that's a huge amount of
shock that absorbed right there.

33:30.470 --> 33:34.419
While the guys are absorbing the
shock of another failed test,

33:34.420 --> 33:38.569
the fact that the wall's still in
one piece after being hit by the car

33:38.570 --> 33:42.590
means this myth has a definite
whiff of plausibility.

33:43.490 --> 33:46.770
***

33:47.240 --> 33:49.059
we're about to find out if Jamie

33:49.060 --> 33:53.789
and Adam can walk the walk on
the world's most unusual bridge.

33:53.790 --> 33:58.370
We have spanned 100-foot chasm
with nothing but duct tape. Soon,

33:58.790 --> 34:04.410
we will take that long walk
into duct tape history.

34:04.650 --> 34:08.130
And just in case that
walk becomes a plunge,

34:08.179 --> 34:12.540
a crane-mounted safety rig will
turn them into human pinatas.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.510
I'm having a great
time. This will work.

34:15.810 --> 34:17.179
***a

34:17.179 --> 34:20.518
I know that this yo-yo fall
arrester will save my life

34:20.520 --> 34:24.059
but if it has to save my life,

34:24.060 --> 34:27.889
I'm going to fall
and pull up short.

34:27.889 --> 34:31.299
Either way it is terrifying
and going to hurt.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.469
It is not just pride that makes
me not want this bridge to fail.

34:34.469 --> 34:37.438
The small-scale tests
say it should hold.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.570
It should be fine.

34:38.571 --> 34:41.130
It is duct tape. What
are you going to do?

34:42.100 --> 34:45.498
Adam's a little lighter
than Jamie and going first.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.699
It will be less
stress on the tape.

34:48.699 --> 34:51.239
Just remember, if you
hear a ripping sound,

34:51.739 --> 34:54.009
run really fast for
the other side.

34:54.010 --> 34:55.210
Thanks for nothing.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.770
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.969
Here we go. Nearly 200
rolls of duct tape,

35:01.970 --> 35:06.930
a 50-foot drop and one
175-pound mythbuster.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.420
All for the glory.

35:09.040 --> 35:09.810
All right.

35:10.380 --> 35:11.670
Here we go.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.074

35:21.570 --> 35:23.810
Hey. I don't mind saying
I'm kind of freaked out.

35:24.230 --> 35:25.220
Oh.

35:26.080 --> 35:26.600
All right.

35:26.601 --> 35:29.790
It feels pretty solid and
not hard to stay upright.

35:30.110 --> 35:32.170
The handles are
working just great.

35:32.220 --> 35:35.580
My heart is beating about
175 times a minute, though.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.930
People walk on bridges
like this every day?

35:42.180 --> 35:43.960
This is terrifying.

35:44.070 --> 35:45.630
Nearing the middle of the bridge,

35:45.680 --> 35:47.390
he enters the real danger zone.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.540
This is where the duct
tape's most likely to fail

35:50.620 --> 35:52.850
and flip Adam into thin air.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.650
I'm passing halfway.

35:56.270 --> 35:58.160
I'm past the danger of turtling.

36:00.070 --> 36:03.670
But dude, this is rough.

36:05.650 --> 36:07.550
Got about ten feet to go.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.640
Now it feels much more
stable and I feel okay.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.550
Two and a half minutes
after starting out,

36:13.670 --> 36:16.110
Adam sets foot on solid ground.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.200
Hey!

36:17.450 --> 36:18.380
Good to see you.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.860
Oh man. Feels good.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.220
Good land. Good, solid ground.

36:23.630 --> 36:25.760
It is another world first.

36:25.830 --> 36:30.920
He's just crossed 100-foot chasm
on a bridge made of duct tape.

36:31.980 --> 36:33.340
I wouldn't have called this

36:33.380 --> 36:35.520
but actually felt quite
stable out at the center

36:35.590 --> 36:37.550
and for the first 15 or 20 feet,

36:37.590 --> 36:42.350
like the first third and last third
were the roughest test where itoves

36:42.390 --> 36:44.260
around a lot more than feels good.

36:44.580 --> 36:45.920
All right. Your turn!

36:47.090 --> 36:49.890
Jamie steadies himself to
make the return journey.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.730
Adam found it terrifying.

36:51.970 --> 36:54.310
I'm going to find it
worse than terrifying

36:54.360 --> 36:56.310
because I really
don't like heights.

36:58.080 --> 37:02.240
His slightly heavier frame will
put added stress on the duct tape.

37:02.370 --> 37:04.920
Oh gosh. Here we go.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.510
And as soon as he puts
the best foot forward,

37:07.580 --> 37:10.710
it's clear this won't
be a smooth crossing.

37:11.170 --> 37:13.900
Now I know what it feels
like to be a spider.

37:14.640 --> 37:18.400
Or maybe is it a bug in a spider

37:21.800 --> 37:24.200
that really is quite hairy.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.490
A third of the way across

37:29.500 --> 37:32.270
and Jamie's struggling
to maintain his balance.

37:36.610 --> 37:40.830
This wiggling around is

37:41.310 --> 37:44.090
kind of something I
don't want to be doing.

37:50.290 --> 37:52.629
Honestly, I'm not sure
he's going to make it.

37:52.630 --> 37:56.929
Both Jamie and the bridge are
teetering on the brink of failure.

37:56.930 --> 37:59.130
There's more ripped tape.

37:59.550 --> 38:04.130
***

38:04.760 --> 38:06.360
***

38:11.790 --> 38:13.709
Tory, Grant and Kari are hoping

38:13.710 --> 38:17.460
it will be first time lucky
for the duct tape roadblock.

38:17.470 --> 38:21.469
It is the same set-up with one
or two heavy-duty add-ones.

38:21.470 --> 38:24.499
We have shackles raided
at 30,000 pounds.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.279
***a

38:27.280 --> 38:29.539
this should do the job.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.880
With Tory's tow bar good to go,

38:30.881 --> 38:36.519
and Grant's rc braking system car
number three's ready for take off.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.559
Are you ready?

38:37.560 --> 38:38.410
I'm ready.

38:38.411 --> 38:41.079
Okay. Brake is off. Here we go.

38:41.080 --> 38:45.580
In three, two, one. Hit it.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.480
Good. Got a good start.

38:49.490 --> 38:51.479
Getting up good speed.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.589
20.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.349
Kari picks up the pace.

38:54.350 --> 38:55.610
Looking great.

38:55.620 --> 38:56.830
Right on target.

38:56.831 --> 38:57.869
Really good.

38:57.870 --> 38:58.619
40.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.250
Oh, we are going to
do it this time, dude.

39:00.251 --> 39:01.310
This is it!

39:02.910 --> 39:04.190
Bull's eye.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.100
The car hits the
duct tape dead on.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.660
Yes!

39:11.860 --> 39:13.770
That was worth all that stuff.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.410
Oh my gosh.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.360
Look at that.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.810
That -- right through.

39:22.050 --> 39:23.710
What would you say? Three inches?

39:23.760 --> 39:25.270
Two and a half
inches of duct tape?

39:25.320 --> 39:26.200
Easily.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.630
That's three inches for sure.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.810
Artora buc tto dhet pe d
didn't give up without a fight.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.650
Despite being hit with a force
totaling nearly 3,000 foot pounds,

39:35.720 --> 39:38.820
the duct tape stretched
like a piece of elastic

39:38.890 --> 39:40.950
before finally snapping.

39:43.270 --> 39:46.710
Well, stretched four, six
feet before it gave up.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.940
Like with all that
time absorbing energy.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.440
Still, an amazing
product but, nope.

39:52.630 --> 39:54.160
Not able to stop a car.

39:54.230 --> 39:57.660
Now, sure, we could have
made one two feet thick.

39:57.700 --> 39:58.690
Let's face it.

39:58.730 --> 40:02.820
We bust up a k-rail and that
stuff is made to stop cars.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.290
Looks like this is busted.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.040
We found something duct
tape finally can't do.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.860
***

40:12.130 --> 40:13.070
man.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.830
Duct tape left over
to fix that thing?

40:16.440 --> 40:18.620
***

40:21.780 --> 40:24.570
meanwhile, Jamie's
trapped in a nightmare.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.360
He's finding out the hard way

40:26.410 --> 40:28.670
that one of duct
tape's main features,

40:28.730 --> 40:33.500
its elasticity, isn't so great
when you're 50 feet off the ground.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.970
Every movement triggers
more vibration.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.210
It's taking all his strength
just to stay upright.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.230
I'm going to sit here
and rest a second.

40:45.580 --> 40:46.410
Okay.

40:47.140 --> 40:50.480
Despite prestretching,
the tape's losing tension

40:50.670 --> 40:53.850
and he hasn't even made it
to the perilous midpoint.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.990
Hey, you passed the halfway point.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.310
Is that all?

40:58.690 --> 41:01.100
It feels like I've
been going for a mile.

41:03.630 --> 41:06.200
And I don't mind saying
I'm hyper ventilating.

41:08.150 --> 41:12.020
The bridge is so unstable he
must inch his way to safety.

41:15.970 --> 41:18.990
It's taken him four
times longer than Adam

41:19.100 --> 41:22.730
but Jamie finally makes
it back to terra firma.

41:23.070 --> 41:24.820
Ladies and gentlemen,
they're made of brass.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.140
James Hyneman, congratulations.

41:29.430 --> 41:30.980
That is absolutely awful.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.290
That's really saying something,

41:33.460 --> 41:36.820
given the other ars he's faced
in the name of mythbusting.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.040
I've been buried alive.

41:39.190 --> 41:42.190
I've been charged by
great white sharks.

41:42.620 --> 41:47.130
This thing here is terrifying
in a totally different way.

41:48.990 --> 41:51.950
It's not so bad walking
across something like this.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.250
Just like going over
the heights with it.

41:54.310 --> 41:58.790
The problem is that
you're just on the verge

41:58.870 --> 42:00.730
when you get a little
ways out into it of,

42:00.780 --> 42:03.620
like, losing balance.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.990
It's -- it's like there's
nothing solid to hold on to.

42:07.260 --> 42:12.770
So, you know, walking across
it is this constant, intense

42:12.920 --> 42:19.030
correction to try and dampen out the wiggly
waves you are setting up on these ropes.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.510
Viewing both walks,

42:20.560 --> 42:23.660
it is clear Adam was on
a much firmer footing.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.400
Why was it so wobbly for me?

42:27.070 --> 42:28.080
Could be me.

42:28.270 --> 42:29.740
Could be the material, though.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.920
We do know that it stretches
out quite a bit under a load

42:32.990 --> 42:35.140
and Adam did, in fact,
put a load on it.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.890
One way or another, it worked.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.330
But it's not an ideal
material for a bridge.

42:41.290 --> 42:43.650
***

42:44.530 --> 42:46.739
I got say I'm pretty
impressed with this stuff.

42:46.740 --> 42:50.730
It's a bridge. It's a rope.
It can shoot. It can float.

42:51.190 --> 42:55.020
Just two sides. And
infinite possibilities.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.349
Verdict, is there anything
duct tape can't do?

42:59.350 --> 43:02.120
Two episodes and
counting, almost nothing.

43:02.310 --> 43:04.159
***

43:04.160 --> 43:06.689
we're going to find crazier
crap to do with this stuff.

43:06.690 --> 43:08.760
Yeah, but that's another episode.

43:08.770 --> 43:09.490
Let's go.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.230
All right.

43:13.670 --> 43:16.420
I think we need to get
airborne with this stuff.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.280
Absolutely.
