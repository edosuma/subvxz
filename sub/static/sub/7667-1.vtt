WEBVTT

02:46.541 --> 02:48.998
Oh, but this is great.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.042
- Wow!
- That's incredible.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.292
There's gotta be at least seven
or eight feet up there.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.214
And 80 years of dust.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.633
Look at all this height.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.532
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and that will leave us with all this space.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.888
- For what?
- Just space.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.561
One, two, three!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.899
- And four?
- Come on.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.985
Four.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.602
And five.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.859
Watch... watch this.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.237
God, this place is huge.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.539
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.873
A little paint.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.956
I'd say you could sell this tomorrow
and double your money.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.418
- Carl, you're obsessed.
- A little bit.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.423
Whoa, look.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.807
Hey, it's an Indian-head penny.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.597
1898.

03:52.399 --> 03:56.062
- It's a good omen.
- You're the good omen.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.568
Oh, it's so great.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.953
I had Rose move your 3:00
with Bob kahan to 4:00,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.526
'cause Gary Alan called
at the end of the day yesterday

04:18.550 --> 04:21.666
and said he has to see you
about the final painting bids for the loft.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.969
3:00 is the only time he could make it.
Is that okay?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.216
Sam?

04:28.018 --> 04:29.554
What are you doing?

04:30.687 --> 04:31.956
- Would you relax, man?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.437
This is not brain surgery
you're going into.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.436
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.524
Sam, you're going to be great. Okay?

04:42.491 --> 04:43.843
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

04:43.867 --> 04:47.530
I mean, I can't very well tell them my
Swedish pom-pom girl joke, you know.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.974
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

04:49.998 --> 04:53.832
Nice, huh? Molly.
What do you think? Are they me?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.664
Oh, man, look at that. A testarossa.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.957
I think you ought to pay off
your mustang first.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.226
How you feeling?
What'd the doctor say?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.601
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

05:16.691 --> 05:18.181
No. Yeah.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.063
He said that I shouldn't even
be coming in today.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.818
- What about the rash?
- The rash?

05:26.451 --> 05:29.784
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.362
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No.

05:36.878 --> 05:41.622
- On your genitals again?
- Yeah, yeah. Right on the genitals.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.714
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.803
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.467
- You're sick.
- I know.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.679
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Carl. Sam.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.229
Hey, Paul.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.142
- Morning, Mr. wheat.
- Morning, Susan. You are looking good.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.316
Sam.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.235
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.190
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.819
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Rose.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.997
- Oh, listen, the kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.245
- They're early.
- I know.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.621
Come here.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.773
Oh, and Andy Dillon called...

06:20.797 --> 06:22.958
- How long have they been here?
- About 10 minutes.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.505
Andy Dillon called and he says

06:24.593 --> 06:27.460
he needs $900,000 transferred
to Albany by 10:00.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.964
By 10:00? Yes.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.050
Excuse me.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.806
Carl? Yeah?

06:34.769 --> 06:35.884
- Good morning.
- Carl.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.469
Bill, hang on one second.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.397
Dillon needs $900,000
in Albany by 10:00.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.086
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.601
- Yeah, I'm gonna need your Mac code.
- Okay.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.947
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.211
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Okay, thanks.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.078
Yeah. Bill, I'm going to
call you back. Okay.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.796
Okay, okay, that's fine.
It's fine. It's fine!

07:14.976 --> 07:16.637
Man, it's too far out.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.727
Can you get this, man?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.186
Where are you guys from,
the New York City ballet?

07:28.657 --> 07:29.988
Almost.

07:34.329 --> 07:38.117
- Saved your life.
- You shit. You scared me to death.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.243
Why did you do that?

07:39.334 --> 07:42.576
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.377
Look out. Look out.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.595
Grab it.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.592
- Sam, mol, are you guys home?
- That's Carl. Did you invite him?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.389
- Slave labor.
- Carl.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.761
- What?
- Hurry, help.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.137
Oh, my god.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.435
- Near the bottom.
- L1 got it.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.791
Now go down.
What? Just down here?

08:01.815 --> 08:02.895
Yeah.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.981
- Just right here?
- Watch your toes.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.069
I got it.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.650
- Hey, where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.356
Good girl.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.276
God, this place looks great.
Yeah.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.158
- You like it, huh?
- Like? Like is hardly the word.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.831
I had no idea it'd be this beautiful.
It's incredible.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.328
Molly, what about her?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.107
Well, why don't we just leave her there
until we get the other stuff in?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.650
We can figure out...
“What are these?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.164
Oh, let me show you.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.695
Hey, you wanna help me lift this up?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.255
What, here? Yeah.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.888
Wow.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.635
- I just finished it. What do you think?
- It's fantastic. I love it.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.052
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

08:43.063 --> 08:45.668
- What do you mean? I love that chair.
- I know you love this chair.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.399
- But we discussed this and...
- Yeah, I've had it forever.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.148
I mean just, when I watch TV, I sit in it.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.480
- Baby, this chair is ugly.
- So?

08:53.575 --> 08:56.408
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.652
You're right. It does.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.243
We'll paint it. We'll what?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.507
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.806
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.483
Are you worried about the promotion?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.236
No, not really.

09:43.583 --> 09:48.122
- Then what? Is it moving in together?
- No.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.922
I don't know. It's a lot of things.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.640
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.803
It seems like

10:09.150 --> 10:11.766
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

10:11.861 --> 10:14.477
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.320
I love you. I really love you.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.207
Ditto.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.527
The pilot's first report of trouble was
that he blew the number two engine,

10:34.551 --> 10:38.009
the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.796
Oh, Jesus, another one.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.890
Oh, don't watch that.

10:46.980 --> 10:51.019
I should cancel my la trip.
These things always happen in threes.

10:52.110 --> 10:56.695
Sam, get serious.
Besides, you lead a charmed life.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.151
Oh, yeah. So did they.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.278
It's amazing, just like that. Blackout.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.270
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.277
Boy, I really must have passed out.

12:24.118 --> 12:27.451
- What time is it?
- It's 2:00 A.M.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.601
Oh, no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.648
Well, it's not now.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.316
Can I help? Yeah.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.773
Put your hands up here. Get them wet.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.787
Now, just let the Clay slide
between your fingers.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.089
Oh, no.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.672
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.296
The Mark Greenberg
and Larry white accounts.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.030
I can't get in.
The Mac code doesn't work.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.512
- No, I changed it.
- You changed it? Why?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.719
Nothing. I just want
to nose around a bit.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.349
Is something wrong?

16:24.442 --> 16:28.526
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, sure.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.937
What's up?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.943
There's too much money
in these accounts.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.821
Too much money?
That's impossible. How could there be...

16:37.205 --> 16:41.164
C72273.

16:41.250 --> 16:45.038
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.790
It already has taken me hours.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.122
Well, let me take it back
and figure it out for you.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.209
No, no, that's okay.
It's... it's like a vendetta now.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.295
- Thanks, though. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.882
- If you start to go blind, just shout.
- Okay.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.223
Listen, I was wondering,
what are you and mol doing tonight?

17:04.315 --> 17:07.272
We're going to the theater.
She wants to see MacBeth.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.983
I think she likes the guys in tights,
personally.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.061
- You want to go?
- No, thanks.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.029
I want a full report, though.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.526
Later. Yeah.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.114
Wonderful.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.036
Excellent. Great.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.247
Well, I loved it. Yes.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.325
I was spellbound the whole time.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.454
I could tell.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.710
And so could the rest of the audience
with that resonating snore of yours.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.717
Did I tell you what Melissa said?

17:38.849 --> 17:41.556
- Yeah, about six times.
- It wasn't six times.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.602
- Now quit being so blasé about this.
- Okay.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.020
Now, this is really important.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.473
I'm gonna have two pieces
in her gallery.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.560
The New York times
reviews her gallery all the time.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.647
Molly, the New York times
is just some frustrated little critic

17:55.741 --> 17:57.719
with pimples on his ass
who flunked out of art school.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.608
So who cares what they think?

18:00.371 --> 18:02.783
About eight million readers, that's who.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.618
Nah, they're just reading
the sports page.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.582
- Your work is really beautiful. It really is.
- Thanks.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.254
And it shouldn't matter what
anyone else thinks. Just what I think.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.008
I want to marry you, Sam.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.557
What? What?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.054
Yep.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.936
I've been thinking about it.

18:31.027 --> 18:35.737
I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I think we should just do it.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.649
You're serious. Yeah.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.367
What's that look for?

18:50.046 --> 18:52.162
You never wanted to talk about it.

19:02.975 --> 19:07.014
- Do you love me, Sam?
- Now, what do you think?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.767
Why don't you ever say it?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.498
What do you mean,
why don't I ever say it?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.504
- I say it all the time. I feel like...
- No, you don't.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.235
You say, "ditto,"
and that's not the same.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.697
People say "I love you" all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.332
You know,
sometimes you need to hear it.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.327
I need to hear it.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.289
Let's go.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.724
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

19:47.812 --> 19:48.852
- What do you want?
- Shit.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.394
Your wallet. Give it to me!

19:51.399 --> 19:56.234
- Sam, just give it to him.
- Okay.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.815
Just take the money. Just leave us...

19:58.906 --> 20:00.316
No, no, Sam!

20:01.033 --> 20:02.489
You son of a bitch!

20:04.912 --> 20:07.494
Sam, no!

20:07.581 --> 20:09.663
Somebody help us!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.615
Jesus Christ! Sam!

20:13.796 --> 20:15.002
Just get off!

20:15.089 --> 20:18.206
Somebody! Somebody help us!

20:18.592 --> 20:19.957
Sam, just let...

20:21.262 --> 20:24.470
Sam, just stop it! Stop it, Sam!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.150
Molly?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.120
Molly? He got...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.551
Oh, baby, hold on.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.046
You're gonna be okay.

21:09.143 --> 21:14.308
Somebody! Somebody!
Somebody help us!

21:14.440 --> 21:18.604
Sam. Oh, my god.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.695
Oh, Sam, come on. Hold on, baby.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.741
Someone's gonna come.
We're gonna be okay.

21:37.671 --> 21:43.917
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Please, anybody.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.009
Help me, please, help me.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.241
It's okay, lady. Take it easy, all right?

21:48.265 --> 21:49.596
Oh, god!

21:50.017 --> 21:51.507
We'll help you, okay?

21:51.602 --> 21:54.389
Molly? Molly? Molly?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.694
Molly.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.403
What should we do?
What should we do?

22:13.040 --> 22:16.749
What? What's happening? What's...

22:17.795 --> 22:20.036
Is he breathing?

22:22.967 --> 22:25.049
Is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.631
Oh, god, Sam, hold on.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.383
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

22:30.808 --> 22:31.923
Oh, my god.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.403
Come on, man.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.389
All right. Okay, come on, it's all right.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.619
Here we go.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.863
All right, there you go. One, two...

22:59.712 --> 23:03.125
Sam, don't you leave me! Sam, hold on!

23:03.424 --> 23:04.630
Sam!

23:05.467 --> 23:07.003
Oh, Sam!

23:27.615 --> 23:29.480
Emergency room.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.094
All right. Right away.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.804
Miss Jensen,
if you'll step this way, please.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.858
Cardiology, please dial extension 255...

24:16.497 --> 24:20.661
So, what happened to you? “What?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.208
You're new, huh? I can tell.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.336
- Are you talking to me?
- Hey, relax.

24:26.423 --> 24:30.211
It ain't like before, you know.
It's a whole new ball of wax.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.926
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.597
She's in 4c, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

24:45.943 --> 24:49.106
Shot, huh? That'll do it every time.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.900
Poor bastard.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.277
Hey, you may as well get used to it.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.571
You could be here for a long while.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.290
Come here, I'll tell you a secret.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.961
Doors ain't as bad as you think.
Zip, zap, they ain't nothing at all.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.787
You'll see. You'll catch on.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.622
This patient's fibrillating.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.092
Where's the paddles?
Get them up here.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.464
He ain't gonna make it.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.389
I've seen it a million times.
He's a goner.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.302
- He's still fibrillating.
- Clear.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.759
Clear.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.272
You see? Here they come.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.903
Lucky bastard.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.158
It could have been the other ones.
You never know.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.557
Who are...

25:59.641 --> 26:01.552
Nursing supervisor,
dial the operator, please.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.180
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.220
No!

26:14.948 --> 26:15.948
Help me.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.492
Oh, god, help me.

26:26.418 --> 26:30.457
"Li am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.172
"I have reached the watery depths.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.834
"The flood overwhelms me.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.677
"I am wearied with calling."

26:41.058 --> 26:44.767
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam wheat,

26:45.562 --> 26:47.894
we are reminded of his kindness,

26:48.649 --> 26:53.018
his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit.

26:54.738 --> 26:58.572
All that we treasure, our loved ones,

26:58.659 --> 27:03.323
our friends, our body, our mind,

27:04.581 --> 27:06.367
are but on loan to us.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.245
We must surrender them all.

27:10.629 --> 27:15.794
We are all travelers on the same road
which leads to the same end.

27:19.930 --> 27:25.721
As our loved one enters eternal life,
let us remember that love too is eternal.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.096
That although we will miss him,

27:30.190 --> 27:33.682
our love will light the void
and dispel the darkness.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.225
I picked up your shirts today.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.569
I don't know why.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.944
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.449
I broke into tears.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.084
It's like I think about you every minute.

28:39.009 --> 28:42.001
It's like I can still feel you.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.228
I'm here, mol.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.991
Floyd, what's the matter, kitty?
What's the matter?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.031
Crazy cat.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.537
Sam?

29:17.297 --> 29:19.333
That's really stupid.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.973
- I love this picture.
- It's great.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.930
Office.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.815
Oh, let me see that.

29:46.910 --> 29:47.945
It's...

29:48.036 --> 29:50.277
- Sam's address book.
- Right.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.618
Dave brubeck, Newport, '88.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.670
- Should I toss them?
- No.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.923
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.046
Hey.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.672
- Oh, you wanted to save those?
- Rolaids?

30:10.767 --> 30:12.507
Molly, what are you doing?

30:21.028 --> 30:25.237
- I just miss him, Carl.
- Me, too.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.325
Carl? Yeah?

30:30.412 --> 30:32.368
Wait a minute. Wait.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.196
- What?
- Not that one.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.452
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.535
- I didn't mean to put that on there.
- That's okay.

30:39.880 --> 30:44.374
Hey, Molly, why don't you come?
It's like summer outside.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.296
No, I really don't. I... I'm not up for it.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.587
Come on, mol, just for a walk.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.533
- It'd be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.094
Molly, you can't stay in here all day.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.222
- It's not healthy for you.
- Look, Carl, I can't do it!

30:57.230 --> 30:59.391
Molly, you're not the one who died.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.398
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.904
Shit.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.409
Maybe you're right.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.739
- Maybe just a short one.
- Attagirl.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.165
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.495
Molly?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.979
What are you doing here?

32:27.487 --> 32:29.148
You bastard.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.944
You son of a bitch!

32:50.594 --> 32:52.209
What do you want?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.170
Molly?

32:56.516 --> 32:58.052
Molly, get out!

32:58.143 --> 32:59.474
Oh, my god.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.442
No, Molly. No, Molly, no, no. Please, no.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.026
Molly, Molly, he's got a gun. Molly!

33:13.116 --> 33:14.856
Hi, kitty. Hi.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.109
You hurt her, I'll kill...

33:19.831 --> 33:21.037
Molly.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.731
Shit.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.855
Is somebody there? Hello?

33:53.907 --> 33:54.987
Hello?

35:09.858 --> 35:11.314
What are you doing?

35:13.486 --> 35:15.101
Let go! What are you doing?

35:16.615 --> 35:17.615
No!

35:20.243 --> 35:22.325
Like trains?

35:33.006 --> 35:35.167
Stay out! This is mine!

36:52.752 --> 36:53.867
Shit.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.216
It's me. I couldn't get it.
She came home.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.186
In a couple of days, man. I'll go back.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.060
Get what?

37:22.532 --> 37:25.740
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

37:31.166 --> 37:34.658
No. You stay away from her.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.873
Do you hear me?

37:38.465 --> 37:40.547
You stay away from her!

38:42.946 --> 38:44.402
Rosa Santiago?

38:50.745 --> 38:52.201
Please be seated.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.845
Our sister will be with us soon.

39:14.102 --> 39:19.688
Sister oda Mae, Grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.190
Appear before us now.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.735
Mrs. Santiago?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.159
I'm oda Mae brown.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.155
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.623
I believe he'll be with us today.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.578
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.004
But you know, Mrs. Santiago,

39:45.466 --> 39:48.253
there's no telling about that other world.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.337
So you've got to be a believer,
Mrs. Santiago.

39:51.431 --> 39:56.266
Are you a believer?
Si si I believe. I believe.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.762
Then let us begin.

40:19.500 --> 40:23.243
I can't. I can't. It's too difficult.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.956
I just can't seem to make contact.
I... I don't feel his... no, wait!

40:29.052 --> 40:30.917
I'm feeling something.

40:31.638 --> 40:36.007
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

40:37.685 --> 40:42.554
Consuelo? Lucita? Julietta?

40:42.649 --> 40:45.857
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

40:45.944 --> 40:49.562
Si, si. His mama. She is Maria.

40:49.656 --> 40:53.820
Yes. Praise god!
I knew he was with his mama.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.653
Oh, my god.

41:01.668 --> 41:05.126
It's too difficult. It's two of them.
I'm not sure I can do that.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.751
- It's so trying... it's...
- Oh, I pay more.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.799
- How much? How much?
- $20.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.298
Oh, way to go. Milk her for every penny.

41:31.906 --> 41:36.149
Yes, I believe we can start again.

41:50.049 --> 41:53.712
Praise the lord. Thank you, Jesus.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.189
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.612
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.986
- My husband?
- Have mercy!

42:18.578 --> 42:20.193
Oh, yeah? Where?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.451
Julio? Yes.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.753
I feel his vibration.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.335
I see him!

42:33.593 --> 42:35.754
How is he? How does he look?

42:35.845 --> 42:37.756
Oh, he's a handsome man.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.797
Handsome?

42:41.851 --> 42:45.764
Mrs. Santiago, in our father's kingdom,
we're all handsome.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.061
Oh, Julio.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.182
Julio's coming towards us. I see him!

42:51.903 --> 42:54.940
He's coming! He's there!

42:58.534 --> 43:00.570
He's dressed in a black suit.

43:02.455 --> 43:03.740
Black suit?

43:05.750 --> 43:06.990
Could be blue.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.622
What a crock of shit.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.040
- Who is that?
- Julio?

43:12.131 --> 43:14.167
Where are you? Julio? Julio?

43:14.258 --> 43:16.544
Did you hear it? Damn.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.422
- Where are you?
- Julio?

43:18.763 --> 43:20.128
Who are you? “Who?

43:20.515 --> 43:22.221
Julio? Julio?

43:22.308 --> 43:25.175
- You can hear me?
- Don't you hear him?

43:25.269 --> 43:26.269
I don't believe this.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.720
Hey, you! Hey, you!
My name is Sam wheat.

43:28.815 --> 43:31.227
Listen, can you hear me? Sam wheat.
Say my name. Say it.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.629
- Leave me alone! Stop it!
- Say my name. Say it! Sam wheat.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.393
Say my name. Sam wheat. Say it.

43:35.488 --> 43:37.103
Talk to me, oda Mae. Say something.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.813
Sam wheat!

43:41.828 --> 43:42.828
Jesus.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.569
- Sam wheat?
- Sam wheat?

43:44.664 --> 43:48.373
I swear, no more cheating. I promise.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.812
Give me penance,
but make that guy go away.

43:49.836 --> 43:51.121
No way.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.172
It's okay.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.763
It's okay.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.595
All right, sister.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.803
- I can't...
- Yeah, you're all right.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.314
My mother had it.
And my mother's mother had it.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.107
They... they both had the gift.

44:15.194 --> 44:18.857
And they always said I had it,
but I never did. I never had it.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.819
They told me what it was like.
They told me all about it.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.242
But now that I got it, I...
I don't think I want it.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.945
So, do me a favor, just go away.
Find somebody else.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.621
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

44:29.709 --> 44:30.949
Yeah, I'm getting there fast.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.250
Well, I think she hit her head
harder than we think.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.190
Well, she was talking to nobody
that wasn't there

44:35.214 --> 44:36.358
before she even hit her head.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.360
Well, I know she is.
But you know, sister can do that.

44:38.384 --> 44:41.547
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.

44:42.096 --> 44:46.715
- Oh, you're standing right beside me?
- Well, honey, we're right here.

44:46.809 --> 44:49.346
Are you white? “What?

44:49.437 --> 44:51.553
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

44:51.647 --> 44:53.012
Oh, god, you know what I think?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.938
Yes, I'm gonna call the doctor right now.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.484
- I knew it. It's a white guy. Why me?
- Listen, damn it.

44:58.571 --> 45:00.937
You are going to help me.
There's a woman.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.069
Her name is Molly Jensen,
and she's in terrible danger.

45:04.160 --> 45:07.994
The man who killed me broke into
our apartment and he's gonna go back.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.536
So you've gotta warn her.

45:09.624 --> 45:11.831
Just what makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

45:11.918 --> 45:13.909
It's just a phone call.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.457
Look,

45:20.426 --> 45:22.041
you're all I've got.

45:22.386 --> 45:25.048
Now, I'm not leaving until you help me.

45:25.848 --> 45:30.057
I don't care how long it takes,
'cause I can talk forever.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.078
She's talking to white people
in the room.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.440
- Hello?
- Hi.

45:45.618 --> 45:47.904
- Is this Molly Jensen?
- Yes.

45:48.371 --> 45:52.080
Well, my name is oda Mae brown.
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor,

45:52.166 --> 45:54.327
and a friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

45:54.794 --> 45:56.563
Now, I know this
is gonna sound a little crazy,

45:56.587 --> 45:59.954
but it's not, and you gotta believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

46:00.758 --> 46:01.793
Who is this?

46:02.301 --> 46:03.791
I got a message from Sam.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.299
What?

46:07.390 --> 46:09.676
Sam wheat. He asked me to call.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.719
- I told you.
- You gotta go there.

46:14.814 --> 46:17.851
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you do.

46:18.818 --> 46:21.059
Second verse same as the first

46:21.153 --> 46:23.690
I'm Henry viii, I am

46:23.781 --> 46:26.067
Henry viii, I am, I am

46:26.158 --> 46:28.865
I got married to the widow next door

46:28.953 --> 46:31.239
she's been married seven times before

46:31.330 --> 46:34.072
and every one was an Henry
Henry!

46:34.166 --> 46:35.656
She wouldn't have a Willie or a Sam

46:35.751 --> 46:36.751
no, sir!

46:36.836 --> 46:39.122
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry

46:39.213 --> 46:41.750
Henry viii, I am, I am

46:41.841 --> 46:44.423
Henry viii, I am

46:44.510 --> 46:46.842
second verse same as the first

46:46.929 --> 46:49.545
I'm Henry viii, I am

46:49.640 --> 46:51.972
Henry viii, I am, I am

46:52.059 --> 46:54.550
I got married to the widow next door

46:54.645 --> 46:56.510
all right, all right, all right!
Stop singing!

46:56.605 --> 47:00.018
I'll go anywhere you want to!
Just don't sing anymore!

47:05.031 --> 47:07.113
I can't believe this.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.594
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What am I doing down here?

47:09.618 --> 47:12.234
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.537
She's probably not even there.

47:14.874 --> 47:16.114
Where are you?

47:19.211 --> 47:20.701
Which building is it?

47:22.590 --> 47:24.205
- Which one?
- Push three.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.071
- See? Nobody's there.
- She's there. Just wait. Just wait.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.757
Look, no. I came down here,
I did everything I said I was gonna do.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.784
I pressed the button. She's not there.
I'm gone. Goodbye.

47:32.808 --> 47:34.077
- Just wait one minute.
- I'm sorry.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.538
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
ninety-nine bottles of beer

47:36.562 --> 47:37.972
take one down and pass it around

47:38.064 --> 47:41.147
all right, don't sing!
All right, all right, all right!

47:41.233 --> 47:42.973
- Hello?
- Yes, hi.

47:43.069 --> 47:44.104
She can't hear you.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.776
Hi, I'm oda Mae.

47:45.863 --> 47:49.230
You know, I called you last night
about your friend Sam wheat.

47:50.451 --> 47:51.736
I told you.

47:58.417 --> 47:59.907
Hey, Molly!

48:00.002 --> 48:03.494
Molly Jensen, I know you're up there!
I know you hear me! I'm down here!

48:03.589 --> 48:06.251
Sam wants to talk to you!
This is for reall

48:07.426 --> 48:10.509
hey, you remember the starfish
in montego bay?

48:10.596 --> 48:12.962
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

48:13.766 --> 48:14.846
Hey, Molly!

48:14.934 --> 48:17.721
I know about the green underwear
that you wrote your name on!

48:17.812 --> 48:20.428
I'd never get over that,
I'll tell you that.

48:20.773 --> 48:24.812
I know about the picture in Reno.
Hey, Molly!

48:27.613 --> 48:31.356
Ask her about the sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

48:31.617 --> 48:34.154
He just asked me
to remind you of the sweater

48:34.245 --> 48:37.203
that's in the closet
that you knitted is too big!

48:37.456 --> 48:38.821
Four sizes!

48:42.169 --> 48:43.534
Hey, you hear me talking to you?

48:43.629 --> 48:46.166
- I hear you.
- Oh, shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

48:46.257 --> 48:47.667
Didn't you ever hear of a phone?

48:48.134 --> 48:49.590
Wanna kiss my butt?

48:50.344 --> 48:52.710
- I'm not gonna stay down here all day!
- Thank god.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.466
Oh, man, shut up!

48:55.391 --> 48:56.551
Molly!

48:57.393 --> 48:59.884
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm out of here.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.310
One, two, three.

49:02.565 --> 49:04.476
- No, oda. Wait.
- No.

49:05.484 --> 49:06.644
It's Molly.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.032
Molly?

49:18.289 --> 49:19.995
I'm oda Mae brown.

49:25.004 --> 49:26.835
I don't know you.
I don't know this guy, Sam.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.442
But let me tell you what he did to me.

49:28.507 --> 49:31.715
He kept me up all night singing
I'm Henry viii, I am.

49:32.845 --> 49:35.211
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.346
Look, I'm sorry.

49:39.351 --> 49:42.434
I just don't believe
in this life-after-death stuff.

49:43.022 --> 49:45.855
- Well, tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.229
You're talking to him right now?
Yeah.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.107
He just asked me to tell you
that you were wrong.

49:52.823 --> 49:56.236
- So, where is he?
- I can't see him. I can only hear him.

49:58.287 --> 49:59.572
I'm right here.

49:59.872 --> 50:01.487
That doesn't help, Sam.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.949
I'm holding her hand.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.744
He says he's holding your hand.

50:17.890 --> 50:19.630
What are you doing?

50:20.726 --> 50:22.307
What do you think you're doing to me?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.789
Hey, look, if you think I'd come
all the way down here for my health,

50:24.813 --> 50:25.848
you're out of your mind.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.431
Sam's dead. Okay? He's dead.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.647
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.571
Sam would never say that.

50:36.951 --> 50:38.282
Ditto! Tell her ditto.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.451
What the hell 1s ditto? Ditto!

51:11.026 --> 51:14.109
Man, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm doing this.

51:14.196 --> 51:17.814
You know, confidentially, nothing like
this has ever happened to me before.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.364
I mean, nothing.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.658
And now I can't turn it off.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.662
Is this him? Is this you?

51:25.749 --> 51:26.955
Yeah. Yeah.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.034
Cute. White, but cute.

51:31.130 --> 51:34.088
What I don't understand is
why did he come back?

51:34.341 --> 51:36.798
- I don't know.
- Why is he still here?

51:37.678 --> 51:40.841
He's stuck, that's what it is.
He's in between worlds.

51:40.931 --> 51:44.674
You know, it happens sometimes.
The spirit gets yanked out so quick

51:44.768 --> 51:47.885
that the essence still feels
like it has work to do here.

51:47.980 --> 51:50.346
- Would you stop rambling?
- I don't think I'm rambling.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.022
I'm just answering her question.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.725
- He's got an attitude now.
- I don't have an attitude.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.732
Yes, you do have an attitude.
We're having a little discussion.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.484
If you didn't have an attitude,

51:59.575 --> 52:01.720
you would not have raised
your voice to me, now, would you?

52:01.744 --> 52:03.826
- God damn it, oda Mae.
- Don't you "god damn it" me.

52:03.912 --> 52:06.308
Don't you take the lord's name in vain
with me, you understand?

52:06.332 --> 52:07.475
- I don't take that.
- Would you relax?

52:07.499 --> 52:09.035
No, you relax. You're the dead guy.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.520
You want me to help you?
You better apologize.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.397
- Because I don't take that from anybody.
- Jesus Christ!

52:12.421 --> 52:13.732
- That's it, I'm leaving.
- What are you doing?

52:13.756 --> 52:17.214
I'm leaving. Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?

52:17.801 --> 52:22.170
- Now you better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay?

52:23.307 --> 52:26.720
Now would you sit down? Please?

52:26.977 --> 52:28.513
He's apologized.

52:30.648 --> 52:32.309
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying,

52:32.399 --> 52:35.436
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

52:35.527 --> 52:38.018
Word for word. Yes.

52:38.113 --> 52:41.776
He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

52:47.581 --> 52:48.741
Molly, you're in danger.

52:48.832 --> 52:52.120
Now you can't just blurt it out like that.
And quit moving around, will you?

52:52.211 --> 52:53.605
'Cause you're starting
to make me dizzy.

52:53.629 --> 52:55.711
I'll just tell her in my own way.

52:56.298 --> 52:59.381
Molly, you in danger, girl.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.135
What are you talking about?

53:03.222 --> 53:04.678
I know the man who killed me.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.045
He knows the man who killed him.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.933
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.759
His name is Willie Lopez.
He's puerto rican.

53:10.854 --> 53:11.889
He knows where he lives.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.667
- Write it down.
- He wants you to write it down.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.057
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damn secretary.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.516
Just do it!

53:20.239 --> 53:21.695
He's so testy.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.010
What is it you want me to write?

53:24.034 --> 53:27.197
It's 303 prospect place, apartment 4d.

53:27.705 --> 53:30.117
303 prospect place? Yeah.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.410
That's my neighborhood.

53:32.501 --> 53:37.336
Molly, he's got my wallet,
he's got my key, and he was in here.

53:37.756 --> 53:39.567
He's got his wallet and his key,
and he was in here.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.528
Yesterday when you came back
from your walk with Carl,

53:41.552 --> 53:43.071
you went up the stairs,
you talked to Floyd,

53:43.095 --> 53:45.115
- you went in, took off your clothes...
- All right, all right.

53:45.139 --> 53:47.846
When you came in yesterday
from your walk with Carl, he was here.

53:47.933 --> 53:50.174
You took your clothes off.
He saw everything.

53:50.269 --> 53:53.136
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.598
I was murdered.

53:56.108 --> 53:57.252
He wants you to go to the police.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.232
He said it was a set-up.
He was murdered.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.089
- There's somebody else involved.
- Look, forget it.

54:01.113 --> 54:02.799
- I don't know who, but...
- I don't want no more

54:02.823 --> 54:04.814
to do with this, okay? Wait.

54:04.908 --> 54:06.928
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?

54:06.952 --> 54:08.888
I'm leaving.
I did everything I said I was going to do.

54:08.912 --> 54:11.403
And don't be following me,
'cause I'm finished. And I mean it.

54:11.498 --> 54:14.581
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death. Goodbye.

54:18.464 --> 54:20.830
Molly, there's no one
on earth besides you

54:20.924 --> 54:22.755
who'd want this to be true
more than me.

54:22.843 --> 54:25.710
But you've got to be rational about this.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.762
I mean, Sam is no more
in this room than...

54:30.142 --> 54:34.977
Look, I understand the need
to hang on to him.

54:35.063 --> 54:37.975
I really do. But this is absurd.

54:38.066 --> 54:42.105
I know this seems absurd.
But it had to be real.

54:42.196 --> 54:44.215
How could you believe
some fortuneteller from Brooklyn

54:44.239 --> 54:45.979
who just shows up at your door?

54:46.074 --> 54:49.237
I sat there and watched her
have a conversation with him.

54:49.411 --> 54:51.948
I don't buy it, mol. Not for a minute.

54:52.039 --> 54:55.497
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

54:56.001 --> 54:59.038
The photo that Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

54:59.338 --> 55:00.828
Carl, we were alone.

55:01.632 --> 55:05.045
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

55:08.347 --> 55:11.839
She said Sam knew who killed him.
Yeah.

55:12.309 --> 55:15.392
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

55:15.479 --> 55:17.310
We're going off the deep end here.

55:17.397 --> 55:19.638
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good.

55:19.733 --> 55:23.021
Willie Lopez.
303 prospect place, apartment 4d.

55:25.030 --> 55:26.611
This is sick.

55:26.698 --> 55:27.813
Oh, Carl.

55:27.908 --> 55:29.523
This is really sick.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.328
Oh, god.

55:33.205 --> 55:35.571
Molly, I don't understand how you could

55:38.544 --> 55:42.332
swallow this crap.
I mean, this guy may not even exist.

55:42.422 --> 55:46.711
This woman, maybe she's just trying
to use you to set someone up.

55:48.554 --> 55:51.546
You're right. You're absolutely right.

55:52.015 --> 55:53.015
No.

55:53.225 --> 55:55.136
That's what I got to find out.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.642
What do you mean, find out?
How are you gonna do that?

55:57.729 --> 56:00.015
Well, she said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

56:00.107 --> 56:02.564
Sam wants you to go to the police?

56:03.402 --> 56:04.562
Jesus, Molly.

56:05.404 --> 56:06.484
Are you out of your mind?

56:06.572 --> 56:07.966
I mean,
what are you gonna tell the police?

56:07.990 --> 56:11.153
Are you gonna tell them
that some storefront psychic lady's

56:11.243 --> 56:12.699
been communing with the dead?

56:12.786 --> 56:14.472
I mean, do you have any idea
what that sounds like?

56:14.496 --> 56:17.033
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

56:19.167 --> 56:20.327
I'm sorry.

56:20.669 --> 56:23.376
It's just this stuff just
really gets to me, you know.

56:23.463 --> 56:25.670
It's okay if you don't believe me.

56:25.966 --> 56:27.502
I'm trying to, Molly.

56:32.055 --> 56:38.893
Look, if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out, okay?

56:40.522 --> 56:42.934
Now, why don't you try
and get some sleep?

56:43.942 --> 56:46.524
Okay? All right?

56:47.821 --> 56:49.340
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

56:49.364 --> 56:50.900
All right. Good night.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.470
Be careful.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.033
Carl. What the hell are you doing here?

57:39.539 --> 57:41.575
Who have you been talking to, Willie?

57:41.667 --> 57:43.658
Talking to? What the hell do you mean?

57:43.752 --> 57:46.243
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

57:46.338 --> 57:49.580
- Now where's she getting it from, huh?
- I haven't said a word to anybody.

57:49.675 --> 57:52.667
She knows your name, god damn it.
She knows where you live.

57:52.761 --> 57:55.753
- A lot of women know where I live.
- This is not a joke!

57:55.847 --> 57:57.633
She knows about the murder.

57:59.434 --> 58:02.642
Now I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is.

58:03.355 --> 58:08.395
And I want you
to just get rid of her, okay?

58:09.987 --> 58:13.730
I've got $4 million stuck
in a goddamn computer.

58:15.367 --> 58:19.781
If I don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon,

58:22.207 --> 58:26.120
I'm... dead. We're both dead.

58:26.211 --> 58:28.011
Why don't you tell them
you only launder money

58:28.088 --> 58:29.669
on the first of the month?

58:29.756 --> 58:32.088
What the hell is wrong with you?

58:32.175 --> 58:35.713
Is everything a joke? You killed a man.

58:35.804 --> 58:38.090
You were supposed to steal his wallet.
Was that a joke?

58:38.181 --> 58:41.389
Man, I did you a favor, man.
That was a freebie.

58:42.561 --> 58:45.394
Look, these are drug dealers, okay?

58:47.107 --> 58:50.975
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job. I could go to jail.

58:51.987 --> 58:53.978
$80,000 of that money is mine.

58:57.659 --> 59:01.823
Look, just let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

59:01.913 --> 59:04.279
I'll get the address book myself, okay?

59:30.233 --> 59:36.479
Bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!

59:39.076 --> 59:43.115
I had a life, god damn you. I had a life!

59:52.089 --> 59:54.796
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

59:55.634 --> 59:56.999
But she was real.

59:58.053 --> 01:00:01.170
What? You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:07.392
You know, you told me if I had
any new information that I should come.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:09.386
So here I am.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.225
I know how this sounds.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.029
I mean, I hear myself saying it
and I want to cringe.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.817
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.410
Things Sam only said to me.

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:28.830
Okay, according to this psychic lady,

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:33.160
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place,

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.496
watching us all the time, huh?

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.460
Well, hell, I'm never gonna
get undressed again.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.297
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:59.103
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.688
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:03.534
Okay.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:08.116
You just wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record, all right?

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.537
Great.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.267
What are you doing?

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:17.397
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for a Willie Lopez.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:21.443
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:25.151
Now, this psychic woman's got a record
that goes back a long way.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:32.789
1967, shreveport,
forgery, selling false ID.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.205
Served one year in 1971.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.205
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:42.335
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974, and...

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.131
Look, this is impossible.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:48.386
- It goes on and on.
- She knew things. Private things.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.285
Now, how could
she have known all that?

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.391
A lot of times they read the obits.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:56.686
All she had to do
was see the word "banker." Boom.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:03:01.437
Hell, they even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:04.645
Letters, old papers,
it doesn't take much.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.532
No.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.192
It was real.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.494
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.001
And songs we sang.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.258
Our trip to montego bay.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.221
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.346
People want so much to believe.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:38.179
They're grieving. They're vulnerable,

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:43.225
and they will give anything
for one last moment.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:47.025
Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:52.367
And I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.331
No.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:02.869
Thank you.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.560
Oh, god, let this be it.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:33.692
Yes.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.049
Hello?

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.168
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.362
- It's Carl bruner.
- What's up?

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.238
I'm fine. Yeah, everything's fine.
Just, we're all set.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.262
Good.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.865
Just let me know
what you want me to do.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.382
Okay, I want you to transfer the money
from the 12 separate accounts

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.719
into a single account
under the name Rita Miller.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:01.849
Okay.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.057
Tomorrow at five minutes
before closing, 3:55 P.M.,

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:09.065
transfer the full account
to the first island bank of Nassau,

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:13.274
registry number 4869580.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.451
- Call us when it's done.
- Okay, I've got it.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:21.741
Just tell Mr. balistreri that there
won't be any more problems, okay?

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.166
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.618
Good work, Carl.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.475
Molly, why can't you hear me?

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:28.731
I need you.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.283
- Who is it?
- It's Carl, Molly.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.579
No. Don't open it, Molly.
Don't open the goddamn door.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.669
He's a murderer.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:48.712
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:51.879
Listen, sorry, I know it's late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:54.757
I just...
I've been thinking about you all day.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.928
And I feel really lousy about...
About what happened last night.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.618
This supernatural thing just really...

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:03.133
Listen, don't worry about it.
Really, it's okay.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:06.220
No, it's not.
You needed me to hear you and I didn't.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:10.564
I wasn't there for you, and that was...
That was wrong.

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:15.236
It's just I... I just...

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:19.199
I want you to know
that I'm your friend, mol.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.618
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never our friend.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.162
- That really means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.662
So I brought you
some Japanese apple-pears.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.242
I know you like them.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.879
Thanks. That's very sweet.

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:37.175
Could I come in for a second?
I won't stay long.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.405
It's just been one of those days.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.511
Maybe a cup of coffee or something?
Yeah.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.429
- Come on in.
- No, Molly.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:47.011
- You seem a little tense. Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:50.347
It's just, god, what can I tell you?
It's been tough.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.272
It's... I mean, you know,

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.312
it just still hurts so much.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.940
You lying snake.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.439
And then on top of it, it's stuff at work.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.492
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.195
But I just haven't really had time
to adjust,

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.452
kind of absorb everything.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.628
It's no big deal.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:24.765
Yeah.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.801
Can I have just a little more cream?
Yeah.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.603
Oh, shit. Jesus. I can't
believe I did that.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.854
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.569
Oh, god.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.386
- Here, let me throw that in the washer.
- No, don't worry about it. It's okay.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:43.524
It's just...

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.862
- You want me to get you another shirt?
- No, it's fine. It'll dry.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.572
- Just take a minute.
- Here you go.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.537
So where were you today?
I thought you were gonna

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.919
come into the bank
and sign those papers.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.252
Well, I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.671
I went to the police.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:15.682
You did? Wow, what did you tell them?
What did they say?

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.441
It was awful.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.402
I felt really stupid.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:26.151
They brought out a file on this woman,
and... at least 10 inches thick.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.613
- A rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:37.127
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:42.630
Molly, sometimes we need to believe.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.258
Why? What's the point?

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:49.341
Molly, it is not easy
to face the realities of life.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.926
Sometimes you've gotta
give yourself that.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.146
What you've got to remember is
the love that you guys felt.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.313
I mean, that's what's real.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.107
You've got to remember
how good Sam was,

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.730
how much he loved you.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.405
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.412
I feel so alone.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.306
You're not alone, okay?

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:35.261
You've got your work.
You're incredibly talented. You're young.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.605
You're fantastically gorgeous.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.818
I don't know what's real anymore.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:44.816
I don't know what to think.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.325
Just think about Sam.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.740
Think about the time
you guys had together,

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.043
how wonderful that was.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.207
Yeah.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.624
Let your feelings out, Molly. It's okay.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.502
Life turns on a dime.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.680
You know?

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:20.477
That there's always gonna be tomorrow,
but that's bullshit.

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:22.308
Sam taught us that.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.649
You have to live for now,

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:30.949
for today.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.176
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:56.134
- I can't. It's just too soon.
- It's okay.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.095
You've been great, Carl.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:05.147
- But I need you to leave.
- It's okay. I understand, totally.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.564
Please.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:15.616
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk.

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:17.537
Can I interest you in that?

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.167
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:31.698
Hey.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:38.953
- Get off my train.
- No.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:42.282
Get off! Get off!

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:45.209
Get off! Get off! Get off!

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:49.005
- Get out of here. Get off.
- No.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.086
Show me how you do that.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:53.071
I want to learn,
and I'm not leaving till you teach me.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.632
- Get off!
- No.

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:57.338
Get off!

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.480
You stubborn asshole.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.940
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.567
What do you mean, what am I...

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:15.614
You're trying to move it with your finger.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.443
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:28.335
It's all in your mind.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.082
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.087
You think you're wearing those clothes?

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:37.670
You think you're crouched
on that floor? Bullshit!

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:41.340
You ain't got a body no more, son.
It's all up here now.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:44.598
If you want to move something,
you've got to move it with your mind.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.101
You gotta focus.
You hear what I'm saying?

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.977
How? How do you focus?

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.229
I don't know how you focus.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.856
You just focus.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.034
- How did you do that?
- You gotta take all your emotions,

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.407
all your anger,
all your love, all your hate,

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.082
and push it way down here
into the pit of your stomach.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.534
And then let it explode like a reactor.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.380
Okay, okay.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.046
Don't laugh!

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:45.617
Way to go, kid!

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.537
I did it.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.374
- I did it.
- Way to go.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:02.096
From your gut, like I told you.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.764
Give it time. What else have you got?

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.361
How long have you been here?

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.154
Since they pushed me.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.786
- Someone pushed you?
- Yes, someone pushed me.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.614
- Who?
- What, you don't believe me?

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:31.325
You think I fell? You think I jumped?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.160
Well, fuck you!

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.745
It wasn't my time.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.549
I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:51.429
Oh, I'd give anything for a drag.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:54.732
Just one drag!

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:56.809
Are you all right?

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.025
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.731
Who sent you?

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.693
Who sent you?

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.751
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.127
Yes!

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.269
So you need to concentrate,

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.376
'cause if you concentrate,
you'll probably rouse him.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.937
- Now what's his name again?
- Orlando.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.063
Orlando.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:23.817
Orlando, Orlando,
is there an Orlando here?

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.398
- I'm here.
- He's here.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:27.323
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:29.072
- What the hell?
- Excuse me, I'm Orlando.

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.653
The line's over there.

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:32.659
Oda Mae, where did
all these ghosts come from?

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.492
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:37.793
I hear them in the morning.
I hear them in the evening.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.165
They're coming into the shower.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:40.696
Sam, what the hell did you do to me?

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.819
Did you tell every spook in the world
you met about me?

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:44.029
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.053
Jesus.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.781
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.090
I don't even believe it.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.160
- It's amazing. You're really doing it.
- Yes, I know.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.219
How do you like that?

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:55.474
- Can you two please hurry this up?
- Oh, chill out. Chill out!

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.917
Listen, I need your help again,
oda Mae.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:58.460
- There's something we need to do.
- No.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:00.349
I'm not doing anything else
with you, Sam.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:04.028
Look, you're holding onto a life
that doesn't want you anymore.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.856
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.816
Are you speaking to me?

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.651
Does it look like I'm speaking to you?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.202
You'll know when I'm talking to you.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:14.075
You supposed to be concentrating,
aren't you?

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.623
Now, you want to try it?
Thank you very much.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.896
Now, Sam,
are you gonna get out of here?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.002
'Cause I got work to do.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.579
Fine, then stay there.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:24.507
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You ready now?

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:26.967
Let's do it.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:30.296
Oda Mae, listen.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:31.618
You see, I figured this thing out.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.509
There's something we can do.
All we gotto do is...

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:35.885
Oda Mae?

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.896
Oda Mae?

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.817
Ortisha?

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.029
Orlando? Is that you?

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.736
Ortisha, where are you at?
I can't hardly see.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:57.995
- Here. She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:05.251
Damn, baby!
What'd you do to your hair?

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:10.461
Orlando, you like it?
It's Autumn sunrise.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.804
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.727
Don't you ever do that to me again.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.058
Orlando!

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.097
- I can barely move.
- Now, you should know better than that.

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:32.449
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:33.616
Everybody out!

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:35.444
What happened to Orlando?

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.450
Where's the insurance policy?

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:41.409
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.915
Everybody out! Get out, get out, get out!

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:45.962
Everybody get out!

01:20:57.895 --> 01:20:59.305
Get out!

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.975
- You the fortuneteller?
- Who are you?

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:04.602
That's an interesting question.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:06.392
Why don't you tell me?

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.398
Willie. Willie?

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:10.938
Prospect place Willie?

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:12.989
Get out of here! Fast!

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.831
- Sister! Sister!
- Oda Mae!

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.837
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.637
Oda Mae, we're in trouble,
so you've got to help me.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.716
What do you mean we? Who's we?
You're already dead.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.955
Don't you understand?
These people are trying to kill me.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.345
Yeah, you're right. And they'll be back.

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:46.169
Look, why don't you just find a house
to haunt, you know?

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:48.104
Get some chains and rattle them
or something.

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:50.686
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and it will work.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:52.737
But you've gotta get
some of your fake ids.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.031
Forget it.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:57.326
If you do this, they'll never
bother you again, I promise.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:03.748
Scouts' honor.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.244
All right.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.456
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:13.508
You got a nice dress?

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.052
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:20.823
I'm sorry I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:23.601
No, I don't think you do.
You know, I think I'm gonna go home.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.750
I'm going home because
I don't know anything about banking.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.918
I don't know that this is gonna work.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.711
- Oda Mae, would you just relax?
- Listen, I'm nervous.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:29.735
Please donate.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.106
I know you're nervous,
but I will get you through it.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:35.781
- And the fake driver's license is great.
- Oh, Sam, I don't think I can do this.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:39.235
You can do it. Straight ahead of you.
A stairway that says, "new accounts."

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.474
- That's where we're going.
- I'm not giving them no money.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.739
- Just do what I say and don't talk.
- Okay.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:49.441
Tell her you're here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:50.465
Can I help you?

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:54.588
Yes, I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.384
And do you know your account number?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.929
092631043.

01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.802
926... 31043.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:02.474
31043.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.727
Rita Miller. “Who?

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.179
- What?
- Tell her Rita Miller.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:08.274
Rita Miller.

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:10.940
Didn't they have you sign a card
when you opened the account?

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:12.797
Tell her Carl bruner opened it for you
by phone

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.882
and asked you to come in today.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:17.069
You see, Carl bruner,
he opened it for me by phone,

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.571
that account, and now he's asked me
to come in today.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.661
I see.

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.655
Is that right? Yeah.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:26.866
All right.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.794
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.543
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:41.175
No, no, no! Rita Miller.

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:43.678
I'm so sorry.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:48.179
You know, I... I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:57.404
Now, tell her to make sure it goes
straight up to the third floor file,

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:58.885
because you have
a transaction to make.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.269
Please make sure this goes right up
to the third floor file,

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.068
because I have a transfusion to make.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.905
- A what?
- Let's go.

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:09.249
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:14.038
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:16.207
Bye-bye.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.633
- I just love these pens.
- Then keep the pen.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.600
- Why are you always making me...
- What do you want to keep the pen for?

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.557
- Carl bruner speaking.
- Hi, Carl.

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:28.135
- Mr. balistreri.
- Balistreri?

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:31.438
- Carl, it's me, John.
- John, John. Sorry.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.357
What... what... what's up?

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.605
I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.905
Oh, right, okay, look, I'll just...
I'll pick it up later. All right?

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:42.449
- All right. I'll be here till 6:00.
- Good.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:48.826
This is it.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.124
I don't suppose I can talk you
into losing the hat.

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:54.169
You keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.706
Tell the guard you're here
to see Lyle Ferguson.

01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:59.086
Lyle Ferguson.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.711
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:05.388
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I'm here for my health.

01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:07.261
Don't say that.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.593
You just tell him Rita Miller's here.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:11.394
Just one moment, please.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:12.808
Don't embellish.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:15.975
Excuse me?

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:22.481
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.613
I've known him for five years,
and he still thinks my name's...

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:29.868
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.745
He's a social moron, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.747
Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.013
You spent time with him
and his wife, Shirley,

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.002
at the Brewster's Christmas party
last year. Got it?

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:43.093
What is this in regards to?
“What?

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.340
He doesn't remember me?

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:47.639
Oh, we spent all that time at the
Brewster's Christmas party last year.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:50.763
He and his lovely wife, Shirley.
It was beautiful.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:54.722
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere. It...

01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:58.312
Gas.

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:03.109
I get a little gas from time to time.
That's all. Gas.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:08.072
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it.

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:10.350
Now, listen, this'll be easy.

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:11.910
Ferguson was so drunk at that party,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.840
he could've had a conversation
with Tina Turner

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.659
and he wouldn't remember.

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:22.712
- I don't know, Sam.
- Here we go.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:28.638
Hello. Hello. Yes.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:34.227
Of course, yes.
Well, it's been a long time.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:35.724
Oh, a long time.

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.216
Ask how Bobby and snooky are doing.

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:39.766
By the way,
how are Bobby and snooky doing?

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.568
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.484
Thank you for asking.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:48.901
And how is your family?

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:50.610
Oh, couldn't be better.

01:26:51.248 --> 01:26:53.284
Well, wonderful.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.250
Tell him you've been wondering
how they did on the Gibraltar securities.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:27:01.330
I was just wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar securities?

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:04.174
The Gibraltar securities?

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:07.344
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:09.296
We sure did. We sure did.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.598
- That was a very useful tip.
- Good old Randy.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:13.550
- Good old Randy.
- Right.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:15.181
Got a good old head on his shoulders.

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:16.499
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:19.014
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:23.227
Yeah. So, what...
What brings you here today?

01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:26.488
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:29.032
Well, wonderful.
Do you have your account number?

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.154
Yes”? Yes.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.327
Yes. 02631043.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:36.032
092631043.

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:37.161
Is that right? Yeah.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.412
Good.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:50.128
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.259
$4 million from us today.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.137
- $4 million?
- Say yes. Say yes!

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.806
Is that correct? Yes.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:00.765
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.642
- That's correct. Yes.
- Easy, easy.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.895
Yes.

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.821
Well, how would you like that?

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:11.615
- Tens and twenties.
- Pardon?

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.568
Cashier's check.
Tell him a cashier's check.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:15.244
I think better, a cashier's check.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:18.039
A cashier's check. Fine.

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:23.128
Well, of course, you know,
we require identification from everyone.

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:24.705
- It's just procedural.
- Oh, ID! Yes.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.210
You know, I...

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:40.437
Thank you. Well, I'll be right back.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.515
$4 million!

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:53.860
Yeah, get me the first island bank
of Nassau. It's on the rolodex.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:07.673
Well, we have some things for you
to sign here.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:10.216
This officially closes the account.

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:13.299
And here you are.

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:15.472
Now, sign Rita Miller.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:20.431
Rita Miller. That's my name.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.980
My name. Rita Miller. My name.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:26.058
My name.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.880
- Molly, hi. It's good to see you.
- Hi.

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:32.155
- Oda Mae, I'll be right back.
- A few more if you would, please.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.652
Just anywhere?

01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:35.108
Right here.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.035
Fine.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:44.243
The check.

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:48.755
This... here you are.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.112
The person you need to see
is right down at the end.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:52.421
Okay, thanks.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:30:00.426
Mama took the money
that she made in the oil Wells,

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.511
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.346
You know,
how they have at the gas station?

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:06.682
And those gas stations
have five or six of those things,

01:30:06.776 --> 01:30:08.437
so it's very, very lucrative.

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:10.314
- Oda Mae.
- It really adds up.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:12.466
- Oda Mae, we've gotta go. Say goodbye.
- Well, gotta go now.

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:15.448
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, a real pleasure.

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:17.116
Now, may I keep the pen?

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:18.909
Say good night to Bobby
and snooky for me.

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.988
I'll see you. Bye-bye.

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:23.414
Why are you rushing me?

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:29.667
What is wrong?

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.925
- Excuse me. Lyle?
- Oh, yes...

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:43.893
- Molly Jensen.
- Molly.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.642
The woman you were
just doing business with.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.394
Yeah? What did she want?

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:51.568
I mean, did it have anything
to do with me or with Sam?

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:53.816
Sam? Why, no. No.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:58.359
- That was oda Mae brown, right?
- No, her name was Rita Miller,

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:00.614
and she was closing an account.

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:05.332
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No. I guess not.

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:06.954
Thank you.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:38.690
Carl, is something wrong?

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.158
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.862
- What?
- One of my accounts is closed.

01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:48.041
Which account? What's wrong?
You want me to call someone?

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:51.878
No, it's okay. I can do it. I got it.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:56.795
$4 million!

01:31:56.886 --> 01:31:58.842
Oh, my god,
what am I gonna do with this money?

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.570
L... you know,
I'm gonna buy the building.

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.338
No, no, wait. I'm gonna buy the block.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.074
I'm gonna make my sister
go to a fat farm,

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.454
because, you know, she's way too big.

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:06.706
Whoa, wait! What are you gonna do...

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:08.374
Then I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building.

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:10.605
Wait, wait, wait, oda Mae,
I've got an idea.

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.412
- Take the check out of your purse.
- Oh, you're right. You're right.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.977
I should take it out.
I should put it where nobody can get it.

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:18.279
No, no, no. Endorse it.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:22.325
No, if I endorse it, then if I drop it,
somebody will get it. No, I'll just...

01:32:22.412 --> 01:32:24.027
It's not your money.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:26.579
I never said
you were gonna get the money.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:28.991
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.872
- Now, endorse the check.
- I know, but...

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:34.375
Well, Sam,
what are you gonna do with it?

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:38.087
Look over there, to your left.

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.841
I know you don't think I'm giving this
$4 million to a bunch of nuns!

01:32:45.935 --> 01:32:48.267
Oda Mae, if you don't do it,
they will track you down.

01:32:48.354 --> 01:32:50.720
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:53.727
Oh, Sam, come on. You're killing me!
It's $4 million!

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:56.104
Just think of it this way,
you'll go to heaven.

01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:57.356
I don't want to go to heaven!

01:32:57.447 --> 01:33:00.280
I want to go to a bank
and cash the goddamn check!

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.114
Hello. Yeah.

01:33:05.205 --> 01:33:07.696
- You'll thank me later.
- How are you doing?

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:11.745
- Now, endorse it Rita Miller.
- I know.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.082
Make it out to St. Joseph's shelter.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:18.123
I can't believe you're making me do this.

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:24.341
Now, give it to her.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:27.411
I will, 1 will. 1 just want to feel it
one more time in my fingers, that's all.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.721
- Just give the lady the check.
- I will!

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:34.977
Hand her the check. You can do it.

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:40.524
- Give her the check.
- I will.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.530
Bless you, child. Bless you.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:57.045
Give it to her. Let go. Let go!

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.002
Shit.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.511
I'm proud of you, oda Mae.

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:07.660
You know something, Sam?
I don't care if you're proud of me.

01:34:07.684 --> 01:34:10.329
You stay away from me from now on.
What is that nun going to do with it?

01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:12.832
She can't even buy underwear. Nothing.
I hate you. Leave me alone.

01:34:12.856 --> 01:34:14.517
Never talk to me again.

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:17.398
I think you're wonderful, oda Mae.

01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:55.728
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.

01:34:57.859 --> 01:34:59.815
They're gonna kill you, Carl.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:03.020
You and Willie,
you're gonna be fertilizer.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.573
They're gonna bury you
right next to Jimmy hoffa.

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:52.322
Who's doing that?

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:54.950
Who's doing that?

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:12.047
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:14.052
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:17.852
I know, mol. I'm sorry.
Things got a little crazy. I just forgot.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.499
Yeah, had a little trouble at the bank.

01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:20.600
You forgot? Yeah.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:21.961
You know, I wish you would have
called me,

01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:23.646
because I've been really worried.

01:36:24.988 --> 01:36:27.570
Listen to me, Molly,
I gotta ask you about something.

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:29.739
Yeah, he needs to borrow $4 million.

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:33.114
When you said that you thought
that Sam was here,

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:34.410
that he was talking to you,

01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:36.738
what did you feel?
What did he say to you?

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:38.310
Why? What does that have
to do with anything?

01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:40.666
It's just... listen to me for a second.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.982
This psychic lady,
I want to know what she told you.

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:46.840
- I wanna know exactly what she said.
- Carl, let me go. Carl, stop this.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.382
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:55.218
What the hell happened to you tonight?

01:36:55.685 --> 01:36:59.143
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:03.682
The bank?

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:07.235
Yeah, Ferguson said she closed
an account.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:11.986
Her name isn't even oda Mae brown.
It's Rita Miller or something.

01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:18.078
Carl, are you all right?

01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.541
It's just my stomach...

01:37:25.381 --> 01:37:26.381
Jesus.

01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:30.132
Do you have any, like, I don't know,
some pepto-bismol or something?

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:32.084
- Cyanide.
- Yeah. It's upstairs.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:35.422
Why don't you sit down, and I'll get it?

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:44.222
What's wrong? Does little Carl
have a little tummy ache?

01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:48.310
What are you doing to me?

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:53.781
Now do you believe in ghosts?

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:00.242
I'll set the place on fire, I swear to god.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.464
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:15.094
I swear to god. I'll cut her throat.

01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:21.350
I need that money,
and I want it tonight at 11:00.

01:38:21.813 --> 01:38:24.429
If that psychic lady
does not bring it here,

01:38:24.524 --> 01:38:26.731
Molly is dead. Okay?

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:31.148
- Carl, who are you talking to?
- Nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:32.820
I have to go, okay?

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.193
I can't explain this now,
but there is a problem, okay?

01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:37.721
- Something's going on at the bank.
- Carl, you're really scaring me.

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.598
I'm sorry, mol.
Look, I don't have time to talk now,

01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:40.862
but I'll come back about 11:00.

01:38:40.957 --> 01:38:42.788
- Why? Why not now?
- Molly, I can't talk now.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:46.208
Molly, look, I'll come back.
What do you say? Like, 11:00, okay?

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:47.705
I'm sorry to do this to you, Molly,

01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:49.358
but it's really important.
I gotta go. Okay?

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:51.293
- 11:00.
- Oda Mae!

01:38:54.971 --> 01:38:58.338
I'm arsenio hall.
Don't try to adjust your television.

01:38:58.433 --> 01:38:59.468
I'm black.

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:04.219
- I want to watch love connection.
- I love love connection.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:07.146
- I love that man on there.
- Leave that! That's arsenio.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:08.894
S07 - what do you mean, so?

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:11.255
You love love connection,
you ought to send your picture in there.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:12.769
She did already.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:14.650
They just haven't answered yet.

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.731
- Oda Mae?
- Sam?

01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:18.720
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Oda Mae, we're in trouble.

01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:20.180
They want the check,
and they're coming for you.

01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:21.306
So you gotta get out of here.

01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:22.724
What do you mean,
they want the check?

01:39:22.748 --> 01:39:24.864
The check you said
they would never know about?

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:27.120
- Oda Mae, what's happening?
- Sam.

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.577
They're here! They're here!
Get out of here! Now! Go!

01:39:29.672 --> 01:39:31.628
Come on. We gotta go!
“What's the matter?

01:39:31.924 --> 01:39:33.289
Come on, come on!

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.516
Just knock on the door here.

01:39:44.937 --> 01:39:47.178
Help! Help!

01:39:47.273 --> 01:39:50.686
- It's an emergency. You gotta let us in.
- Who are you kidding?

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.866
Open up!

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:03.452
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:06.781
The cat don't like visitors.
She'll pee all over that...

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.629
They're gonna get us.

01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:20.045
Where's Sam?

01:40:20.139 --> 01:40:23.723
- Shit! It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:36.401
Carl?

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:55.997
Shit!

01:41:26.664 --> 01:41:27.699
Willie!

01:41:36.799 --> 01:41:39.666
Hey, man,
you got a serious problem, man.

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:04.653
Help me! Help!

01:43:01.217 --> 01:43:03.048
That dude 1s dead.

01:43:08.766 --> 01:43:10.302
You're dead, Willie.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:37.583
No! No! No!

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:42.083
Help me!

01:44:04.447 --> 01:44:06.278
Tell the driver to hurry.

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:08.822
Yo, man, you wanna step on it, please?

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:11.525
Listen, lady, I'm driving as fast as I can.

01:44:19.962 --> 01:44:21.122
Problems?

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:31.299
- Carl, is that you?
- No, it's me, oda Mae.

01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:33.506
Listen. Molly,
I know what you think of me.

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:35.871
I know what you think of me,
but, look, you gotta talk to me.

01:44:35.895 --> 01:44:37.760
You are in serious danger.

01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:39.387
I got Sam here with me.

01:44:42.651 --> 01:44:44.687
- I'm calling the police.
- Good.

01:44:44.779 --> 01:44:47.099
- Tell her to do it.
- Fine. That's what we want you to do.

01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:48.646
We want you to call the police.

01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:50.606
- But you've gotta let us in.
- No.

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.741
Look, don't you get it?

01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:55.820
Sam was not just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.

01:44:55.915 --> 01:44:58.827
He found out that Carl
was laundering money at the bank.

01:44:58.918 --> 01:45:02.035
Now, this guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you, he tried to kill me.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.994
He's gonna try to kill you, too.

01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:06.546
You are in deep, deep trouble.

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:08.666
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:11.210
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:11.388 --> 01:45:13.595
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:13.682 --> 01:45:17.266
I can't. I just... I just can't.

01:45:17.353 --> 01:45:20.891
Oda Mae, oda Mae,
tell her she's wearing the shirt

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.017
that I spilled the Margarita on

01:45:23.108 --> 01:45:25.565
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:28.478
Molly, Sam says to tell you
you're wearing the shirt

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:30.187
that he spilled the Margarita on

01:45:30.282 --> 01:45:32.898
and the earrings he gave you
for Christmas.

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:42.871
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake, not about this.

01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.504
Give me a penny, quick. “What?

01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:52.175
Push a penny under the door, now.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:54.241
What you be talking about,
push a penny under the door?

01:45:54.265 --> 01:45:55.880
Just do it.

01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:36.637
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:15.376
We're between Greene and Mercer
on prince.

01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:18.634
It's the gray building right across
from the post office.

01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:22.095
Thanks, sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.

01:47:23.187 --> 01:47:25.519
- All right. They're on their way.
- Good.

01:47:27.983 --> 01:47:31.225
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.

01:47:41.497 --> 01:47:42.987
Is Sam here?

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.706
Sam?

01:47:47.252 --> 01:47:48.867
I'm sitting beside her.

01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:52.712
He's sitting right beside you.

01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:04.220
Sam, can you feel me?

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.723
With all my heart.

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:11.189
He says with all his heart.

01:48:23.706 --> 01:48:26.698
I'd give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

01:48:31.046 --> 01:48:32.286
He says he wishes

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:35.213
he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:39.210
Me, too.

01:48:56.321 --> 01:48:59.984
Okay. Okay, look. You can use me.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:04.614
- Use you?
- You can use my body.

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:05.740
Use your body?

01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:07.537
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

01:52:13.685 --> 01:52:14.891
Molly?

01:52:16.605 --> 01:52:18.186
Molly, are you home?

01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:19.517
It's Carl.

01:52:20.317 --> 01:52:21.432
Molly!

01:52:21.526 --> 01:52:22.686
Fire escape.

01:52:30.077 --> 01:52:31.692
What's happening to me?

01:52:35.874 --> 01:52:37.034
Molly?

01:52:38.377 --> 01:52:39.537
Molly?

01:52:48.303 --> 01:52:49.303
Molly!

01:52:50.347 --> 01:52:51.883
Son of a bitch.

01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:06.602
Come on.

01:53:09.658 --> 01:53:11.444
Molly, look. Look.

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:14.826
Oh, let's go. Let's go.

01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:25.666
Molly!

01:53:26.049 --> 01:53:28.085
Just get away from us, Carl.

01:53:31.305 --> 01:53:33.296
- Molly!
- You're just a liar. Liar!

01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:35.470
Molly, you got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

01:53:35.684 --> 01:53:37.015
- She's a con artist.
- Why?

01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:40.060
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly.

01:53:41.773 --> 01:53:43.183
Stop!

01:53:43.275 --> 01:53:45.641
Just get away from us, Carl.
I've called the police.

01:53:45.736 --> 01:53:46.736
Molly!

01:53:56.538 --> 01:53:57.823
Shit.

01:54:00.542 --> 01:54:04.376
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- Don't interfere, Molly. She's a thief.

01:54:05.297 --> 01:54:08.084
All right, the check.
Just give me the check.

01:54:08.216 --> 01:54:10.377
- Carl, no.
- Stay out of this, Molly!

01:54:15.932 --> 01:54:16.932
Son of a bitch!

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.303
Keep out of this, Molly!

01:54:20.645 --> 01:54:22.636
Get off of Mel

01:54:27.903 --> 01:54:31.395
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, god damn it!

01:54:31.948 --> 01:54:34.439
- I gave it away.
- You're lying to me.

01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:37.818
Don't lie to me, god damn it!

01:54:38.413 --> 01:54:40.574
The check.

01:54:54.137 --> 01:54:57.425
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to god, I'll kill her.

01:55:03.438 --> 01:55:09.399
Just... look, just give me the check,
Sam. Okay?

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.232
I promise you I'll let her go
if you'll just give it to me.

01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:14.817
Okay?

01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:17.201
Sam?

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:20.785
Sam?

01:56:37.407 --> 01:56:38.897
Sam.

01:56:41.495 --> 01:56:44.658
Oh, Carl. “What?

01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:19.406
No!

01:57:52.816 --> 01:57:54.397
Are you two all right?

01:57:58.446 --> 01:57:59.652
Sam?

01:58:02.617 --> 01:58:03.777
Molly?

01:58:06.204 --> 01:58:07.614
I can hear you.

01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:45.820
Oh, god.

01:59:33.667 --> 01:59:37.376
Sam? They're waiting for you, Sam.

01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:50.426
I'll miss you.

01:59:52.394 --> 01:59:54.601
Your mother'd be proud.

01:59:54.896 --> 01:59:56.761
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sam.

01:59:58.024 --> 01:59:59.560
You're all right.

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.437
Bye, oda Mae.

02:00:03.905 --> 02:00:05.145
Bye, Sam.

02:00:28.263 --> 02:00:29.673
I love you, Molly.

02:00:32.308 --> 02:00:34.048
I've always loved you.

02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:42.440
Ditto.

02:01:03.631 --> 02:01:05.246
It's amazing, Molly.

02:01:06.634 --> 02:01:10.627
The love inside, you take it with you.

02:01:22.192 --> 02:01:23.477
See you.

02:01:31.075 --> 02:01:32.315
See you.

02:01:51.346 --> 02:01:52.677
Bye.
