WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:04.428
...On the Secret life of American Tennger.
You wanna help me out?

00:04.429 --> 00:06.397
Then I'll just be
a teenage mother enabler.

00:06.398 --> 00:08.766
Mom, you're gaining weight.
You're tired all the time.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.701
How could you be pregnant
at your age?

00:10.702 --> 00:11.969
I don't mind
if my dad dates.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.304
I just don't see her
as stepmother material.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.607
Jack and I are having sex
for the first time.

00:16.608 --> 00:19.009
You can't keep jack
just by having sex with him.

00:19.010 --> 00:21.612
You're absolutely sure
that the vasectomy worked,
right?

00:21.613 --> 00:23.447
I feel stronger
than I ever have.

00:23.448 --> 00:24.782
We just had sex.

00:24.783 --> 00:26.784
Marshall's dead.

00:26.785 --> 00:28.652
We're gonna have a baby.
Yep.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.020
I got you this.

00:30.021 --> 00:32.923
It's beautiful.

00:32.924 --> 00:35.959
I was wondering
what you would think
if I asked your mother

00:35.960 --> 00:38.028
if the three of us
got a house together.

00:38.029 --> 00:40.030
Really? We could move
to a house?

00:40.031 --> 00:42.933
How would you like to go
to Italy this summer?
To Bologna?

00:42.934 --> 00:45.135
What would I do there?
Work at your uncle's hotel.

00:45.136 --> 00:47.471
I don't want you to have sex
with any other guys.

00:47.472 --> 00:48.705
Will you marry me?

00:50.341 --> 00:52.843
I feel a little funny
about giving you a car...

00:52.844 --> 00:54.978
What is this,
some kind of a bribe?

00:54.979 --> 00:56.680
If that's the way
you want to look

00:56.681 --> 00:58.782
at a brand-spanking-new
SUV.

00:58.783 --> 01:01.585
I'm Griffin. You want
to have lunch with me?

01:01.586 --> 01:03.487
You make it sound
as if it's a date.

01:03.488 --> 01:04.521
I'm gay.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.856
I think that's my baby, Anne.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.891
Yeah, I think it is, too.
I love you.

01:07.892 --> 01:09.693
Did you see Madison
a lot last summer?

01:09.694 --> 01:12.696
It was nothing.
We just had a few meetings
of the Dead Parents Club.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.566
So we're getting a brother?
Yep. It's a boy.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.501
I'm never gonna
have sex again with you.

01:17.502 --> 01:19.837
You know I care about you.
I love you, Adrian.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.638
I met someone. A guy.

01:21.639 --> 01:23.974
Jeff, this is my son Tom.
You're the boyfriend?

01:23.975 --> 01:27.811
Hey, uh, when do you think
you might be coming here?

01:27.812 --> 01:31.014
It's my new house.
I live in a house now.

01:31.015 --> 01:33.717
I wanna have sex.
What are we supposed
to do, Jack?

01:33.718 --> 01:35.018
Oral sex.

01:35.019 --> 01:37.020
Aren't you afraid
that one day

01:37.021 --> 01:39.690
Amy will move away
and take John with her?

01:39.691 --> 01:41.925
I don't guess there's anything
I can do but follow her.

01:41.926 --> 01:44.928
The baby is coming right now!
George!

01:44.929 --> 01:46.330
I'm gonna have to
deliver this baby.

01:46.331 --> 01:47.564
And you think you'll lose her

01:47.565 --> 01:49.032
if your friend from Italy
comes over here.

01:49.033 --> 01:51.502
What do you wanna name him?
I was thinking maybe your dad.

01:51.503 --> 01:52.836
Robert Scott Juergens.

01:52.837 --> 01:54.938
I take it Jack went home?
Yeah, he went home.

01:54.939 --> 01:56.039
I'm breaking up with him.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.774
Whose boy are you?

02:05.350 --> 02:07.751
She's coming here?
Now?
Yeah.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.286
Her dad has
a business trip planned,

02:09.287 --> 02:11.288
and she wants to come with him
to see me.

02:11.289 --> 02:13.957
Did you ask her
to come with him so that Amy
would break up with you?

02:13.958 --> 02:15.993
No, she's a friend.
She's just a friend.

02:15.994 --> 02:18.996
So you didn't even have to
ask her to come here now
to break you up with Amy?

02:18.997 --> 02:20.964
No, she just decided
to come now.

02:20.965 --> 02:22.966
I told her
to come in the summer.
In the summer.

02:22.967 --> 02:24.301
I was over there in the summer,

02:24.302 --> 02:26.003
so I thought that she should
come here in the summer.

02:26.004 --> 02:28.872
I thought that she and Amy
could hang out with me
in the summer

02:28.873 --> 02:31.642
just like I hung out with her
and her friends in the summer.

02:31.643 --> 02:34.578
Not the same. That was
your platonic girlfriend
you hung out with?

02:34.579 --> 02:37.014
Did you tell her that Amy
is your platonic friend?

02:37.015 --> 02:39.483
No, I did not. I just said
that she was my girlfriend.

02:39.484 --> 02:42.686
Was. Not is. Was!
What else did you tell her?

02:42.687 --> 02:44.488
I told her not to come.
I swear.

02:44.489 --> 02:47.591
She said if she came here now
with her dad, maybe I could
go back there this summer.

02:47.592 --> 02:50.027
Maybe you could go
back to Bologna in the summer?

02:50.028 --> 02:52.029
Of course you can go back
to Bologna next summer

02:52.030 --> 02:53.931
if you have no reason
to be here next summer.

02:53.932 --> 02:56.600
I feel sick to my stomach.
You've felt sick to your stomach
for a couple of months.

02:56.601 --> 02:59.469
So get it over with.
If you're gonna break up with
her, break up with her already.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.672
I can't.
I-- I just can't.

03:01.673 --> 03:04.241
Do it!
And do it yourself.

03:04.242 --> 03:06.877
Don't let Amy break up with you
because your Italian girlfriend
is showing up.

03:06.878 --> 03:09.413
Break up with her because
you don't want to be
with her anymore,

03:09.414 --> 03:11.982
because that's the honest
and manly thing to do.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.519
If you love her,
if you ever loved her,
break up with her.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.991
You waited this long.
Just let it play out.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.693
You think so?
Yeah, I do.

03:22.694 --> 03:23.994
Hank!

03:23.995 --> 03:26.997
That's me.
I gotta go.

03:31.803 --> 03:32.803
Hi.

03:32.804 --> 03:33.937
Hi.

03:33.938 --> 03:35.005
What?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.007
What are you up to?
Up to?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.776
Yeah. Up to. We can tell
you're up to something.

03:39.777 --> 03:41.645
What? No, I'm not up
to anything.

03:41.646 --> 03:44.715
Amy may be too busy to notice,
but we're not.

03:44.716 --> 03:46.850
Notice what?
That you're thinner

03:46.851 --> 03:49.353
and paler and "nervousier."

03:49.354 --> 03:52.589
That's not even a word.
You're supposed to be
a wordsmith, Madison.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.958
Speaking of which,
I gotta get to English class.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.727
You've got time
to talk to us.

03:56.728 --> 03:59.029
Talk to us. Are you trying
to break up with Amy?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.198
What would make you say that?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.866
Because you didn't say,

04:02.867 --> 04:05.602
"No, I most certainly am not
trying to break up with Amy."

04:05.603 --> 04:07.704
You said, "What would
make you say that?"

04:07.705 --> 04:09.840
Which makes us think
that you are.

04:09.841 --> 04:11.975
And I'll tell you something,
sausage prince.

04:11.976 --> 04:15.545
Our Amy's been through hell.
Through hell, I tell you.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.949
And you are not
gonna break up with her.
Not now, not ever!

04:18.950 --> 04:20.884
The only way that you
are ever, ever getting out

04:20.885 --> 04:22.986
of this relationship
is if she wants out.

04:22.987 --> 04:26.723
Yeah. If she wants out.
And she doesn't want out.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.225
What is going on here?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.627
Who said
that I was gonna?

04:30.628 --> 04:31.928
Oh, God.

04:39.003 --> 04:40.804
Better be the swine flu.

04:40.805 --> 04:43.640
Even if it isn't,
he's a pig.

04:43.641 --> 04:46.843
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And we gotta keep that pig
in our sights

04:46.844 --> 04:48.979
until we know
what he's up to.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.947
Yeah. We owe that to Amy.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.384
Do we have to go home?

04:54.385 --> 04:56.253
Well, you missed two days
of school already.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.021
Well, I brought my books.
I'm studying.

04:58.022 --> 05:00.924
My grades are a lot better
this year.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.627
I love, love, love
getting away with you.

05:03.628 --> 05:06.430
Just us and the babies.
It's been so nice.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.500
This place is great.
You can smell the ocean
from here.

05:10.501 --> 05:12.736
Please, Mom? Let's stay.
Maybe we shouldn't have lied.

05:12.737 --> 05:16.540
We had to. There's no
"I can't deal with my life"
holiday for moms and daughters.

05:16.541 --> 05:18.709
Amy--
Mom, as soon
as we leave here,

05:18.710 --> 05:20.811
we're gonna have to go back
to our regular lives.

05:20.812 --> 05:22.312
You're gonna have to
take care of Mimsy,

05:22.313 --> 05:24.881
and I'm gonna have to
go back to school.

05:24.882 --> 05:26.817
Just one more day.

05:30.421 --> 05:35.833
<i>*Falling in love Is such an easy
thing to do*</i>

05:35.960 --> 05:38.895
*  Birds can do it We can do it*

05:38.896 --> 05:41.398
- Let's stop talking
Let's get to it *

05:41.399 --> 05:44.267
"Let's fall in love "

05:49.607 --> 05:52.275
What's going on?

05:52.276 --> 05:54.978
Nothing. I'm not, uh--
I'm not feeling well.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.980
I think I may go home.
No, that's not it.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.982
I beg your pardon?
Are you breaking up with Amy?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.218
That's between Amy and me.
So you are.

06:01.219 --> 06:02.719
I don't know.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.554
But I can't talk to you
about this.

06:04.555 --> 06:06.156
If I talk to anyone,
it's gotta be Amy.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.924
I'm begging you,
don't do it.

06:07.925 --> 06:08.859
What?

06:12.897 --> 06:15.399
The gene for red hair
is recessive.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.867
Wait. Repeat that part.

06:16.868 --> 06:18.902
The gene for red hair--
it's recessive.

06:18.903 --> 06:21.905
Recessive, huh?
Yeah.

06:21.906 --> 06:24.908
Is Amy's mother's hair
really red, or does she just
color it red?

06:24.909 --> 06:27.911
Um, I think
it's really red.
Why?

06:27.912 --> 06:29.246
Oh, nothing.

06:29.247 --> 06:30.313
Something.

06:30.314 --> 06:31.915
No. Nothing.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.550
But did you ever
meet her boyfriend?

06:33.551 --> 06:35.919
No, I didn't. Why?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.320
Come over after school.

06:37.321 --> 06:38.722
Again, why?

06:38.723 --> 06:41.625
Because we haven't had
any time to hang out together.

06:41.626 --> 06:44.494
Because you haven't spent
more than five minutes
away from Ricky lately.

06:44.495 --> 06:45.929
It's not what you think.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.464
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

06:47.465 --> 06:49.733
It's not sex.
It's not.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.235
What, you just suddenly enjoy
spending time together?

06:52.236 --> 06:54.838
No, not suddenly.
We've always enjoyed
spending time together.

06:54.839 --> 06:58.175
I always enjoyed
spending time with Jack
until we started having sex.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.877
You had sex once.
And a half.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.579
Okay, wait.
Once and a half?

07:02.580 --> 07:04.581
You know what I mean.
Oh, yeah.

07:04.582 --> 07:06.650
Yeah, I know what you mean,
girlfriend.

07:06.651 --> 07:07.884
Look, I just--

07:07.885 --> 07:09.886
I just don't think
you gave it a chance.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.156
So you and Ricky...
The two of you...

07:13.157 --> 07:14.458
We do.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.827
Both of you?
Yes, both of us.

07:18.162 --> 07:20.263
I just think
it's unnatural.

07:20.264 --> 07:23.166
Okay. Each to his own.

07:23.167 --> 07:24.334
But...

07:24.335 --> 07:27.704
Well, maybe Jack
was just not experienced at it.

07:27.705 --> 07:29.840
Do you know
he's not experienced at it,

07:29.841 --> 07:31.842
or are you guessing
he's not experienced at it?

07:31.843 --> 07:34.411
I'm guessing.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.746
Hey, private
conversation here.

07:37.849 --> 07:39.349
Geez.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.921
Maybe I'm no good at it.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.858
Because it was me,
not Jack.

07:47.859 --> 07:50.927
I was just gonna do it
because it was,

07:50.928 --> 07:52.863
you know, not a good time
to have sex.

07:52.864 --> 07:55.365
Wait. So he didn't...

07:55.366 --> 07:57.534
No, he-- he didn't.

07:58.903 --> 08:00.537
Okay.

08:00.538 --> 08:02.205
Uh...

08:02.206 --> 08:03.807
Okay, look,

08:03.808 --> 08:06.443
no one is not good at sex.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.179
You know, there's not really
a good and a bad sex.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.815
It's just, uh,
it did make you feel good,

08:11.816 --> 08:13.817
or it didn't
make you feel good.

08:13.818 --> 08:16.219
Or it's right for you,
or it's wrong for you.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.221
Or you're glad you did,
or wish you hadn't.

08:18.222 --> 08:20.790
But-- But there's not really

08:20.791 --> 08:22.459
a good or bad.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.127
At least that's my opinion.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.129
Well, it was wrong for me,
and it didn't make

08:26.130 --> 08:27.797
either of us feel good,
and I wish we hadn't.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.267
All right, all right.
We'll just find you
a new boyfriend.

08:30.268 --> 08:32.434
I can't do that.
Why? He has.

08:32.436 --> 08:34.604
He has not.
That's what I heard.

08:34.605 --> 08:35.705
Madison?

08:35.706 --> 08:37.240
Oh, no.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.576
No, no, no, no, no.
It's someone new.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.080
Okay, you can't do that.

08:44.081 --> 08:45.849
Okay, don't do that.
We're at school.

08:45.850 --> 08:49.185
I don't wanna be at school.
I wish I was anywhere
but school.

08:49.186 --> 08:51.621
You could come over
to my house if you want.

08:51.622 --> 08:54.257
Yeah. Okay.
Or we could do something.

08:54.258 --> 08:55.292
Like...

08:55.293 --> 08:57.661
Like skip school
and go somewhere.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.164
Where?
I don't know. Haven't you
ever taken a day off?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.366
No, I'm--
I like school.

09:03.367 --> 09:07.037
I like school, too,
but I just can't be here today.
I have to get away from here.

09:07.038 --> 09:08.705
I'm in.

09:08.706 --> 09:10.740
You can't be in.
You've got football practice.

09:10.741 --> 09:13.310
You already missed
one game this year.
You've got band practice.

09:13.311 --> 09:14.778
I'm not in
the marching band anymore.

09:14.779 --> 09:16.780
I'm just doing orchestra.
I have to work now.

09:16.781 --> 09:18.782
You're not
in the marching band?
No, I'm not.

09:18.783 --> 09:20.784
I tried, but I couldn't
keep up with the schedule.

09:20.785 --> 09:22.786
I have responsibilities now.
I have John.

09:22.787 --> 09:24.154
I can miss practice.

09:24.155 --> 09:25.789
Maybe I have the flu
or something.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.424
I can come back tomorrow,
feel better,

09:27.425 --> 09:28.792
and I don't miss a thing.

09:28.793 --> 09:30.794
I had the flu.
I don't have the flu.

09:30.795 --> 09:34.230
You can't do that.
That's what I'm using-- the flu.

09:34.231 --> 09:36.566
You don't have the flu.
You don't have the flu.

09:36.567 --> 09:38.735
I don't have the flu.
Just walk out.

09:38.736 --> 09:40.270
Come on. Let's do it.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:55.786 --> 09:58.822
Maybe it's not too late
to fix things, okay?

09:58.823 --> 10:00.557
Maybe you and Jack
can get back together

10:00.558 --> 10:02.058
before he gets serious
about this girl.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.493
Just tell me
who he's dating.

10:03.494 --> 10:06.329
I don't know her name.
I just heard he was
dating someone.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.797
And you should, too.

10:07.798 --> 10:09.766
Hey, maybe Ricky knows someone
you can go out with.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.134
Doubt it.

10:11.135 --> 10:13.803
Oh, hey, hey. Um,
do you know where Ricky is?

10:13.804 --> 10:15.538
Oh, he left
with Ben and Jack.

10:15.539 --> 10:16.706
He left?

10:16.707 --> 10:18.608
Yep.

10:18.609 --> 10:21.111
Let's get out of here.

10:21.112 --> 10:24.614
Get out of here? I have
three minutes to get across
the school to get to algebra.

10:24.615 --> 10:26.616
Forget it. Don't go.

10:26.617 --> 10:28.818
You don't need algebra.
You need to get out of here.

10:28.819 --> 10:32.055
What? Are you talking about
what I think
you're talking about?

10:32.056 --> 10:35.792
I'm just talking about leaving
school for a little off-campus
lunch and a little fun.

10:35.793 --> 10:37.727
That's it.
Can go?

10:39.196 --> 10:40.697
Oh, uh, hi, Ashley.

10:40.698 --> 10:42.632
You're ditching school?
Yeah.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.668
No, we are not.
We would never do that.

10:44.669 --> 10:46.369
I would,
if I got the chance.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.638
Won't your sister rat you out?
Who's gonna tell her?

10:48.639 --> 10:51.041
Probably the principal
when we all get caught.

10:51.042 --> 10:53.810
So you're going?
Come on. Let's get out of here
before the bell rings.

10:53.811 --> 10:55.679
"Get out of here"?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.048
If you're leaving here,
you're taking me with you.

10:59.383 --> 11:01.084
Okay, fine.
Let's go.

11:08.359 --> 11:10.193
Okay, what was
that about?

11:10.194 --> 11:12.195
We don't know.
You tell us.

11:12.196 --> 11:14.297
I can tell you.
Ricky, Jack and Ben

11:14.298 --> 11:17.167
have all left the building,
and they're following them.

11:17.168 --> 11:19.069
I bet this has
something to do
with Ben and Amy.

11:20.771 --> 11:22.772
Is he gonna
break up with her?
No, he's not.

11:22.773 --> 11:24.374
Ben's not breaking up
with Amy.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.775
Then why is he
acting so weird?

11:25.776 --> 11:28.511
Because he is weird.
Come on.

11:28.512 --> 11:31.281
Where are we going?
Wherever the rest of them
are going.

11:31.282 --> 11:34.117
Wow.
We're skipping school?
We can't skip school.

11:34.118 --> 11:37.620
I have a license.
I have a car.
Let's bounce.

11:45.229 --> 11:46.730
Yes?

11:46.731 --> 11:48.598
Miss Bink?
- Dr. Bink.

11:48.599 --> 11:50.533
Doctor, huh? PhD?

11:50.534 --> 11:52.402
That's still a doctor.
What do you want, punk?

11:52.403 --> 11:54.771
A little respect.
Earn it.

11:54.772 --> 11:56.239
You were fired
from you last job

11:56.240 --> 11:58.374
for having sex
with a student,

11:58.375 --> 12:01.311
you received your PhD
from the Internet,

12:03.180 --> 12:06.282
and your husband left you...
for another guy.

12:06.283 --> 12:09.018
1, The other guy
was his cousin.

12:09.019 --> 12:12.322
2, There are
some excellent schools
on the Internet.

12:12.323 --> 12:14.691
And 3, The student
to whom you are referring

12:14.692 --> 12:16.726
was 18 before
we went to the prom.

12:16.727 --> 12:19.028
And we did it
as a political statement.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.697
And there was no sex involved.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.732
I just like to dance.
What's your point?

12:22.733 --> 12:25.335
My point is
maybe this time,

12:25.336 --> 12:27.370
you'd like to establish
yourself as a real counselor

12:27.371 --> 12:29.038
and not just a dancer.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.073
I can help you with that.

12:30.074 --> 12:31.307
Go on.

12:31.308 --> 12:33.409
In return, I would want
certain benefits.

12:33.410 --> 12:34.711
We're not talking
quid pro quo.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.246
We are.

12:36.247 --> 12:38.181
I see. What do you have for me?

12:38.182 --> 12:39.349
May I?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.322
Where was I?

12:46.323 --> 12:48.458
Students leaving campus
to have sex.

12:50.027 --> 12:53.696
Ben Boykewich,
son of Leo Boykewich,
the Sausage King--

12:53.697 --> 12:56.299
the Sausage King is single,
by the way--

12:56.300 --> 12:58.301
loaded and single,

12:58.302 --> 13:00.904
although he's engaged
to a hooker-

13:00.905 --> 13:02.472
So Ben left campus

13:02.473 --> 13:05.108
with the all-star
quarterback Jack Pappas,

13:05.109 --> 13:06.676
who just broke up
with his girlfriend

13:06.677 --> 13:08.945
because he wanted...

13:08.946 --> 13:11.347
oral sex from her,
and she said no.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.552
Oh, and driving them
is the drummer.

13:16.687 --> 13:18.121
Ricky Underwood.

13:18.122 --> 13:19.455
Yeah, that guy.

13:19.456 --> 13:21.457
In the other car is Adrian Lee,

13:21.458 --> 13:23.226
the school slut,

13:23.227 --> 13:24.694
along with her best friend,

13:24.695 --> 13:28.198
the "still Christian
but former virgin,"
Grace Bowman,

13:28.199 --> 13:29.465
who would not have oral sex

13:29.466 --> 13:31.234
with the aforementioned
quarterback.

13:31.235 --> 13:33.036
And with the two of them
is Ashley Juergens.

13:35.206 --> 13:36.206
Ashley.

13:38.509 --> 13:39.609
Try to keep her out of it.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.977
Because you have a thing
for her?

13:40.978 --> 13:42.679
No, because she'd kill me--

13:42.680 --> 13:44.981
she and her protector,
this Griffin guy.

13:44.982 --> 13:46.382
He's the only guy
in the girls' car.

13:46.383 --> 13:49.485
He's-- He's gayer
than Gary Garrison.

13:49.486 --> 13:50.620
That's pretty gay.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.021
Yeah.

13:52.022 --> 13:54.290
Not that anyone has
a problem with it--

13:54.291 --> 13:56.960
no one who's comfortable
with their own sexuality,
at least.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.994
Anyone else?

13:57.995 --> 13:59.195
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

13:59.196 --> 14:00.930
There's a clown car
with the sidekicks.

14:00.931 --> 14:02.665
Henry and Alice, whose
relationship is so hot

14:02.666 --> 14:04.500
it's contributing
to global warming.

14:04.501 --> 14:07.670
And with the two of them
is Lauren and Madison.

14:07.671 --> 14:08.605
Lesbians?

14:09.940 --> 14:10.940
Not yet,

14:10.941 --> 14:12.675
but maybe down the line.

14:12.676 --> 14:15.578
And they've all left campus
to have sex together?

14:15.579 --> 14:17.647
No, no, no, with just
whoever they can find.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.984
Any idea where these alleged
trysts will be taking place?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.019
Let's talk about me
for a minute.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.389
What's going to happen
with you and me?

14:27.958 --> 14:29.692
Firstly, no sex.

14:29.693 --> 14:30.960
And secondly?

14:30.961 --> 14:32.028
Secondly, if you bust them,

14:32.029 --> 14:33.296
it will be the biggest bust

14:33.297 --> 14:35.465
in the history
of Grant High School.

14:35.466 --> 14:38.568
Which means I can do
pretty much anything I want.

14:38.569 --> 14:40.270
As long as I'm not anything.

14:40.271 --> 14:43.106
Listen,
I'm not going to jail

14:43.107 --> 14:45.675
for you or any other minor
who wants to sleep with

14:45.676 --> 14:48.344
or even dance with
a professional educator.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.913
I have learned my lesson.

15:03.807 --> 15:05.508
What the hell's
he doing in there?

15:05.509 --> 15:07.043
He's probably
getting a sweater.

15:07.044 --> 15:08.411
It's 75 degrees out.

15:08.412 --> 15:10.680
He likes layers.
Haven't you ever noticed?

15:10.681 --> 15:11.814
That Ben likes layers?

15:11.815 --> 15:13.449
No. Why would I notice that?

15:13.450 --> 15:14.817
Thought it was noticeable.

15:14.818 --> 15:16.819
So I guess you heard.

15:16.820 --> 15:18.187
I heard you broke up,

15:18.188 --> 15:20.056
and I don't want to know
anything about it.

15:20.057 --> 15:22.125
She was having her period,
so I thought maybe she--

15:22.126 --> 15:25.328
Shut up. I just said
I don't want to know
anything about it.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.132
And if you have to ask
a woman to do that,

15:29.133 --> 15:30.800
then obviously she
doesn't want to do that.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.135
You two shouldn't
be having sex.

15:32.136 --> 15:34.103
You shouldn't
be having sex.

15:34.104 --> 15:35.171
I'm not having sex.

15:35.172 --> 15:36.372
I'm just letting Grace
think

15:36.373 --> 15:37.607
I'm having sex
with someone else.

15:37.608 --> 15:40.276
Because?
Because then she'll
want me back.

15:40.277 --> 15:42.845
I mean, she wants me back.
I know she wants me back.

15:42.846 --> 15:44.313
It's just an ego thing.

15:44.314 --> 15:45.848
I got all tied up
with what happened--

15:45.849 --> 15:47.683
or didn't happen.

15:47.684 --> 15:49.852
So I'm going to let her
think I want someone else,

15:49.853 --> 15:51.854
and that'll give her
a reason to come after me.

15:51.855 --> 15:53.856
It's a win-win.
Or a lose-lose.

15:53.857 --> 15:55.858
What if she decides
to get another boyfriend

15:55.859 --> 15:57.360
because you're having
sex with someone?

15:58.862 --> 16:00.630
No, it's not going to happen.

16:00.631 --> 16:02.632
Why not?
Because Adrian's
helping me.

16:02.633 --> 16:03.766
Helping you how?

16:03.767 --> 16:05.168
You and Adrian
are not having sex,

16:05.169 --> 16:06.269
any kind of sex.

16:06.270 --> 16:07.470
Of course not.

16:07.471 --> 16:08.571
There's no of course not.

16:08.572 --> 16:09.772
You had sex with her before.

16:09.773 --> 16:11.774
One time.

16:11.775 --> 16:13.576
She's just telling Grace
I'm seeing someone else

16:13.577 --> 16:15.378
so Grace will want
to go back with me.

16:15.379 --> 16:16.679
Adrian agreed to do that?

16:16.680 --> 16:17.780
Yeah.

16:17.781 --> 16:19.382
When are you talking
to my girlfriend?

16:19.383 --> 16:20.783
Uh...

16:20.784 --> 16:22.051
No more talking to Adrian.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.719
Don't get her involved
in your problems, okay?

16:23.720 --> 16:24.687
All right.

16:29.793 --> 16:31.460
I think that's your phone.

16:31.461 --> 16:33.095
Yeah?

16:33.096 --> 16:34.096
Aren't you going to answer it?

16:34.097 --> 16:35.565
No, I'm not.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.768
I have to answer it.

16:38.769 --> 16:39.802
Hello.

16:39.803 --> 16:41.537
Hello.

16:41.538 --> 16:42.805
Hello. Who's this?

16:42.806 --> 16:44.774
This is the school counselor

16:44.775 --> 16:46.809
calling to find out
why you're not in class.

16:46.810 --> 16:47.810
Coach, is that you?

16:47.811 --> 16:49.345
No, it's not Coach.

16:49.346 --> 16:50.646
It's Dr. Bink.

16:50.647 --> 16:51.714
Dr. Bink?

16:51.715 --> 16:53.216
Yes. New counselor.

16:53.217 --> 16:55.318
Are you truant, Mr. Pappas?

16:55.319 --> 16:56.385
I had a groin injury,

16:56.386 --> 16:57.486
if that's what you're
talking about.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.322
Who is that?
The counselor.

16:59.323 --> 17:00.456
And who is that?

17:00.457 --> 17:02.491
Would that be Ricky?

17:02.492 --> 17:04.694
No, that's not Ricky.
That's, uh, my dad.

17:04.694 --> 17:06.229
He had to pick me up
from school

17:06.230 --> 17:07.396
because of the truancy.

17:07.396 --> 17:09.332
Truant means
you're absent from school.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.766
It's not a disease, moron.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.001
Your father is correct.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.435
May I speak with him, please?

17:13.436 --> 17:14.704
Uh, he can't talk
while driving.

17:14.704 --> 17:15.771
It's against the law.

17:15.771 --> 17:17.240
I'm going to have
to call you back.

17:19.343 --> 17:20.476
We have to go back.

17:20.477 --> 17:21.777
No, we don't.

17:21.778 --> 17:22.712
What the--

17:33.790 --> 17:35.658
What are you doing, man?

17:35.659 --> 17:38.427
I thought that if we're
going to take the day off,

17:38.428 --> 17:39.695
we should do it in style.

17:39.696 --> 17:41.030
Wow. Thanks.

17:41.031 --> 17:42.198
You can't drive that car.

17:42.199 --> 17:43.432
You don't have a license.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.101
Even if you did,
you're a bad driver.

17:45.102 --> 17:46.302
You just hit a parked car.

17:46.303 --> 17:47.803
You can drive.
Oh, no.

17:47.804 --> 17:49.805
I'll drive.
All right. You can drive.

17:49.806 --> 17:50.806
Are you insane?

17:50.807 --> 17:52.408
What if something
happens to the car?

17:52.409 --> 17:54.477
Your dad will kill you,
and then he'll kill me.

17:54.478 --> 17:56.145
I'll take
full responsibility.
Let's go.

17:56.146 --> 17:57.480
This is a bad idea.

17:57.481 --> 17:59.515
What are you,
a wuss?
A what?

17:59.516 --> 18:00.650
Hey, guys,

18:00.651 --> 18:02.518
my dad took off
with Betty for the day.

18:02.519 --> 18:03.753
It's her birthday.

18:03.754 --> 18:05.755
They're not going to be
back until late tonight.

18:05.756 --> 18:07.356
Come on. It'll be fun.

18:07.357 --> 18:08.758
I need to have some fun,

18:08.759 --> 18:10.693
even if it's just car fun.

18:22.773 --> 18:25.074
So where are we going
to meet guys?

18:25.075 --> 18:26.342
It's a surprise.

18:26.343 --> 18:28.177
I don't like surprises.

18:28.178 --> 18:29.645
Surprises are fun.

18:29.646 --> 18:31.080
You should have some fun.

18:31.081 --> 18:33.349
You need to go out there
and have a good time.

18:33.350 --> 18:34.784
I can't have a good time

18:34.785 --> 18:36.519
unless I know where we're
going to have a good time.

18:36.520 --> 18:37.787
We don't have to go anywhere.

18:37.788 --> 18:39.055
Just driving around
without my family

18:39.056 --> 18:40.222
is a good time for me.

18:40.223 --> 18:41.791
How's your dad with the--

18:41.792 --> 18:42.792
What? The lawn?

18:42.793 --> 18:44.794
Yeah. The lawn.

18:44.795 --> 18:46.562
Oh, he was not
going to say lawn.

18:46.563 --> 18:48.531
What's going on
at your house?

18:48.532 --> 18:49.632
Nothing.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.334
Nothing's ever going on
at my house.

18:51.335 --> 18:53.302
We're one of the most
normal families

18:53.303 --> 18:54.804
in the whole state
of California.

18:54.805 --> 18:56.472
We are one of the most
normal families

18:56.473 --> 18:57.606
in the whole country.

18:57.607 --> 18:59.075
We are one of the most
normal families

18:59.076 --> 19:00.109
in the whole world.

19:00.110 --> 19:01.644
You are not even
the more normal family

19:01.645 --> 19:02.678
in the neighborhood.

19:02.679 --> 19:04.046
I didn't say we were.

19:04.047 --> 19:05.281
How's your mom
and the new baby?

19:05.282 --> 19:06.749
Why? What have you heard?

19:06.750 --> 19:08.184
Nothing. I'm just asking.

19:08.185 --> 19:10.186
Oh, yeah? And how's
your mom and her new baby?

19:10.187 --> 19:11.620
She doesn't have a new baby.

19:11.621 --> 19:13.723
I think she's referring
to the boyfriend.

19:13.724 --> 19:15.624
Does everybody know about that?

19:15.625 --> 19:16.625
Yes.
Yes.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.461
Uch. I hate him.

19:18.462 --> 19:19.762
Grace, I thought Christians

19:19.763 --> 19:21.197
weren't supposed
to hate anyone.

19:21.198 --> 19:22.431
Okay, I don't hate him.

19:22.432 --> 19:23.766
I just hate that he's
dating my mother.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.101
Because?

19:25.102 --> 19:26.135
Because she's
still in mourning

19:26.136 --> 19:27.103
for my father.

19:28.271 --> 19:29.739
She is.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.607
We all mourn
in different ways.

19:31.608 --> 19:32.608
Oh-ho-ho.

19:33.677 --> 19:34.744
Sorry.

19:34.745 --> 19:36.512
You'll feel better
when you find

19:36.513 --> 19:37.747
someone
to go out with.

19:37.748 --> 19:39.749
Maybe you should
date an older guy,

19:39.750 --> 19:42.518
maybe someone your mother's
boyfriend's age.

19:42.519 --> 19:43.753
You know, just to point out

19:43.754 --> 19:45.287
that age
does make a difference.

19:45.288 --> 19:46.288
Only legally.

19:46.289 --> 19:47.556
Yeah, real legally.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.024
You point, Counselor?

19:49.025 --> 19:51.093
It is a crime
to have sex with a minor,

19:51.094 --> 19:52.495
and a minor
is anyone under 18.

19:52.496 --> 19:53.763
The greater
the difference in age,

19:53.764 --> 19:55.131
the greater the penalty.

19:55.132 --> 19:56.732
If the perp is more
than three years older,

19:56.733 --> 19:57.767
it's a felony.

19:57.768 --> 19:58.768
What?

19:58.769 --> 19:59.769
Yeah.
The older he is,

19:59.770 --> 20:01.003
the more serious the charges.

20:01.004 --> 20:02.071
That's how it works,

20:02.072 --> 20:03.272
even if you want to have sex

20:03.273 --> 20:04.407
with a guy 19 or older.

20:04.408 --> 20:05.775
Who's going to
press the charges?

20:05.776 --> 20:07.109
The police.
It's their business

20:07.110 --> 20:08.778
if I have sex with a guy
that's older than me?

20:08.779 --> 20:10.346
Yep. You're a minor.

20:10.347 --> 20:11.781
Until you're not a minor,
it's their business.

20:11.782 --> 20:13.315
What if I have
my mother's permission?

20:13.316 --> 20:14.784
Wouldn't matter.
She'd just be an accessory.

20:14.785 --> 20:16.385
Did you know this?

20:16.386 --> 20:17.386
Yeah.

20:17.387 --> 20:18.521
No.

20:18.522 --> 20:20.189
It's not something
I have to worry about

20:20.190 --> 20:22.091
because I'm not having
sex until I'm 18.

20:22.092 --> 20:24.093
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.094 --> 20:25.428
That's what Grace said.

20:25.429 --> 20:26.896
Oh, thanks
for pointing that out.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.400
Do you have sex?

20:31.401 --> 20:33.169
Me?
Yeah.

20:33.170 --> 20:34.437
Tell us about gay sex.

20:34.438 --> 20:36.539
Um, no.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.808
He's not having sex
until he's 18.

20:38.809 --> 20:40.209
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.445
I said I'm not dating
until I leave high school.

20:42.446 --> 20:44.513
Ooh, you're having sex
but not dating?

20:44.514 --> 20:46.715
I don't want to talk
about this, okay?

20:46.716 --> 20:48.350
I'm just
along for the ride.

20:48.351 --> 20:49.452
Yeah, with?

20:52.255 --> 20:53.222
I don't know.

20:54.925 --> 20:55.791
Hello.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.426
Griffin, is that you?

20:57.427 --> 20:59.328
Nope. Wrong number.

20:59.329 --> 21:00.563
I don't know.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.511
Huh. Could be the school.

21:15.512 --> 21:18.047
Yes. Someone's calling us
from the school.

21:18.048 --> 21:20.115
Oh, no. Now we're all
going to get in trouble.

21:20.116 --> 21:21.984
We're going to get
kicked out of school,

21:21.985 --> 21:24.453
all because
of oral sex gone bad.

21:24.454 --> 21:26.188
Oral sex
is neither bad nor good.

21:26.189 --> 21:27.623
I told you that.

21:27.624 --> 21:30.159
Oh, boy. that's what happened
between you and Jack?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.393
You know that's what happened.

21:31.394 --> 21:32.528
Everybody knows.

21:32.529 --> 21:33.529
I didn't know.

21:33.530 --> 21:35.664
I knew. But I don't care.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.366
No one cares, Grace.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.734
I care.

21:44.508 --> 21:45.774
If you want us,

21:45.775 --> 21:47.643
you're going to have to
come and get us, Coach!

21:49.713 --> 21:52.348
Woo! I'm having fun!

21:52.349 --> 21:54.049
Tell me where we're going.

22:00.690 --> 22:01.757
Hello.

22:01.758 --> 22:03.826
Hello, girls. And Henry.

22:03.827 --> 22:06.095
Hank. He's changing
his name to Hank.

22:06.096 --> 22:07.763
Doesn't matter what he
changes his name to.

22:07.764 --> 22:09.098
He's still supposed
to be in school.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.800
Alice, if you turn back now,

22:11.801 --> 22:13.202
no one gets hurt.

22:13.203 --> 22:14.870
It's just a blip
on your permanent record

22:14.871 --> 22:16.305
and a few days' suspension.

22:16.306 --> 22:17.673
Is that
the cafeteria lady?

22:17.674 --> 22:19.575
Is this the cafeteria lady?

22:19.576 --> 22:21.243
No, this is Dr. Bink,
the new counselor,

22:21.244 --> 22:23.379
and I'm busting you
for grand truancy.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.747
Did she say Bink?

22:24.748 --> 22:27.016
Yes. Dr. Wilhemina Bink.

22:27.017 --> 22:28.450
I've heard that name before.

22:28.451 --> 22:29.852
Aren't you that lady
who got fired

22:29.853 --> 22:31.186
for taking a kid
to the prom?

22:31.187 --> 22:33.222
There was nothing
illegal about that!

22:33.223 --> 22:36.358
My mom was her
court-appointed shrink.

22:36.359 --> 22:37.993
Maybe we should think
about going back.

22:37.994 --> 22:39.995
We don't know where
we're going anyway,

22:39.996 --> 22:41.931
and we don't know where
to look for anyone.

22:43.099 --> 22:44.233
Where are we going?

22:44.234 --> 22:45.467
No one seems to know.

22:45.468 --> 22:46.936
I know.

23:09.115 --> 23:10.649
Man,
this was a good idea.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.652
I haven't been
to the beach since...

23:13.653 --> 23:15.254
I don't remember.

23:16.823 --> 23:18.457
When was the last time
you were here?

23:18.458 --> 23:20.225
Um...

23:20.226 --> 23:22.161
Let's see. I think--

23:22.162 --> 23:23.996
I think it was
a few weeks ago.

23:23.997 --> 23:25.864
What, you were just here
a few weeks ago

23:25.865 --> 23:27.166
and you didn't invite me?

23:27.167 --> 23:28.400
It was a family thing.

23:30.170 --> 23:31.370
Uh, kind of.

23:31.371 --> 23:33.138
My dad and I were
with Donovan and Leon

23:33.139 --> 23:34.306
and their family.

23:34.307 --> 23:36.241
Donovan and Leon are gay,
right?

23:36.242 --> 23:37.342
Yeah, so?

23:37.343 --> 23:39.545
So you haven't
introduced me

23:39.546 --> 23:41.413
to Donovan and Leon
because...

23:41.414 --> 23:43.582
Because they're
an old married couple
with five children.

23:43.583 --> 23:46.251
And what, they're
too stable for me?

23:46.252 --> 23:47.452
Look, I'll introduce you.

23:48.888 --> 23:50.889
Geez, is the whole world
about you?

23:50.890 --> 23:53.091
Oh. Crabby.

23:53.092 --> 23:56.028
How can you be crabby
on a day like this?

23:56.029 --> 23:57.896
They invited us,

23:57.897 --> 24:00.065
and they didn't invite you
because--

24:00.066 --> 24:03.435
because we just needed
to get out of the house
for a while,

24:03.436 --> 24:04.503
Dad and me.

24:06.072 --> 24:08.073
It's going to be fine.

24:08.074 --> 24:11.143
It is. It'll all work out.
You'll see.

24:15.081 --> 24:17.549
The only thing that's going
to get her back here is Ben.

24:17.550 --> 24:18.884
If he breaks up with her,

24:18.885 --> 24:20.285
she's just going to go off
and start a new life.

24:20.286 --> 24:21.753
Then let her
start a new life.

24:21.754 --> 24:22.988
Who cares?

24:22.989 --> 24:25.023
Who cares? I care.
That's my son.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.792
Yeah. That is your son.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.861
That's why I told you
to get a court order

24:28.862 --> 24:30.929
so she couldn't
take him out of the state.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.397
She's not taking him
out of state.

24:32.398 --> 24:33.665
She's just taking him
far enough

24:33.666 --> 24:35.234
that I can't see him
every day.

24:35.235 --> 24:36.902
What the hell happened?

24:36.903 --> 24:38.070
I don't know.

24:38.071 --> 24:39.671
All of a sudden,
she and her mother

24:39.672 --> 24:41.273
want to move
to Palm Springs

24:41.274 --> 24:43.242
to take care
of her grandmother
who's got Alzheimer's.

24:45.078 --> 24:47.045
So the two of them
left town

24:47.046 --> 24:48.614
to take care
of their grandmother.

24:48.615 --> 24:50.148
Yeah, to take care
of their grandmother.

24:51.484 --> 24:53.518
Wait. Isn't that--

24:53.519 --> 24:55.053
Isn't that
where Mrs. Juergens

24:55.054 --> 24:57.322
was renovating a house
with her boyfriend?

24:57.323 --> 24:58.557
In Palm Springs?

24:58.558 --> 25:00.092
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

25:00.093 --> 25:01.760
Amy didn't even tell me
she was going

25:01.761 --> 25:03.095
until after she'd left.

25:03.096 --> 25:04.496
And then she called me

25:04.497 --> 25:06.732
to tell me I didn't need
to come around last night

25:06.733 --> 25:08.200
or tonight or tomorrow night.

25:08.201 --> 25:09.835
And we got into an argument,

25:09.836 --> 25:12.237
and it turned into maybe
she's not coming back at all.

25:12.238 --> 25:13.705
She's looking at schools
and day care

25:13.706 --> 25:14.907
and all that stuff.

25:14.908 --> 25:16.942
She can't just move
without your permission.

25:16.943 --> 25:18.810
Yes, she can. She can
do anything she wants.

25:18.811 --> 25:20.279
She's the mother,
and we're not married.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.513
That doesn't make a difference.

25:21.514 --> 25:23.081
That's your son, Ricky.

25:23.082 --> 25:25.617
Claim your son.
You have rights.

25:25.618 --> 25:27.586
Maybe I don't
look at it that way.

25:27.587 --> 25:30.122
It's a privilege
for me to see my son,

25:30.123 --> 25:32.324
and I don't want
my privileges revoked, okay?

25:32.325 --> 25:33.759
Can't George talk to Amy?

25:33.760 --> 25:35.294
Can't he do anything?

25:36.829 --> 25:37.763
Wait.

25:39.098 --> 25:41.300
Her mom just took off, too?

25:41.301 --> 25:42.701
Without George?

25:44.270 --> 25:45.904
They just had a baby.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.574
That is his baby.

25:51.144 --> 25:52.577
That isn't his baby?

25:52.578 --> 25:55.213
There seems
to bsome argument
going on about that.

25:55.214 --> 25:56.949
Wow.

25:56.950 --> 25:58.150
I can't talk about it.

25:58.151 --> 25:59.284
I said
I wouldn't talk about it.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.356
But she knows-- Ashley.

26:05.692 --> 26:08.193
Every time it seems
that my life might work out,

26:08.194 --> 26:09.394
everything changes.

26:13.199 --> 26:14.733
What? What did I say?

26:14.734 --> 26:16.468
You're not the only one,
you know.

26:16.469 --> 26:17.502
What?

26:17.503 --> 26:19.504
I think my mom is leaving.

26:19.505 --> 26:20.639
What?

26:20.640 --> 26:22.240
Now? They just
moved in together.

26:22.241 --> 26:24.876
Yeah. Good for me,
bad for her.

26:25.945 --> 26:27.913
She got an offer--

26:27.914 --> 26:30.582
a job offer.
It's a promotion.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.986
She'd be working
in public relations
for the airline.

26:33.987 --> 26:35.887
But...

26:35.888 --> 26:37.923
the job is in New York.

26:39.192 --> 26:40.592
So I-- I don't know.

26:40.593 --> 26:43.695
I could go with her,
or I could stay with him,

26:43.696 --> 26:46.965
but either way I'm not
going to be with the two
of them together

26:46.966 --> 26:48.667
unless she doesn't
take the job.

26:50.803 --> 26:53.405
The only person I really
want to be with is you.

26:54.707 --> 26:55.741
Who knows?

26:55.742 --> 26:57.843
You might leave
to be with Amy,

26:57.844 --> 26:59.911
since you don't want to do
things through the court.

26:59.912 --> 27:01.380
You don't really know
how courts work.

27:01.381 --> 27:02.547
You've never been there.

27:02.548 --> 27:04.916
You don't just get
what you want, you know.

27:04.917 --> 27:08.153
And I'm trying to get Ben
to get Amy to stay here.

27:08.154 --> 27:09.888
Maybe you could talk to him.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.123
I've talked to him.

27:11.124 --> 27:13.325
But it seems like
his Italian girlfriend

27:13.326 --> 27:14.659
can show up at any minute.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.094
Yeah, he told me.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.172
She told you that

27:27.173 --> 27:28.740
so you'd be jealous
and call me.

27:28.741 --> 27:30.542
How could I call you
after what happened?

27:30.543 --> 27:33.078
Nothing happened. You just
got all freaked out.

27:33.079 --> 27:34.946
No, I didn't.

27:34.947 --> 27:36.481
Okay, I did.

27:36.482 --> 27:39.317
But I'm just not comfortable
doing certain things with you.

27:39.318 --> 27:41.219
Well, you could get
comfortable if you wanted.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.487
And if I don't want?

27:42.488 --> 27:43.822
That's okay, too.

27:43.823 --> 27:45.891
There's lots of other
things we can do together.

27:45.892 --> 27:47.492
But we have
a whole lifetime.

27:47.493 --> 27:49.327
We don't need to try
everything all at once.

27:49.328 --> 27:51.763
I just want every time
to be like the first time.

27:51.764 --> 27:53.632
Yeah, yeah. The first time.
It was great.

27:53.633 --> 27:55.233
It was great.

27:55.234 --> 27:56.701
It could be greater,
you know?

27:56.702 --> 27:58.437
As our love gets greater.

27:58.438 --> 27:59.538
You know what?

27:59.539 --> 28:01.306
Having sex ruined
everything for us.

28:01.307 --> 28:03.875
No, no, no.
Not continuing to have sex

28:03.876 --> 28:05.277
ruined everything for us.

28:05.278 --> 28:07.345
But everything's not ruined.

28:07.346 --> 28:08.547
I swear.

28:08.548 --> 28:09.948
Let's just look
at the past few weeks

28:09.949 --> 28:11.049
as a break, all right?

28:11.050 --> 28:12.217
We took a little break,

28:12.218 --> 28:13.552
and now we're
getting back together

28:13.553 --> 28:14.719
after our little break.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.121
That depends.

28:16.122 --> 28:18.123
on what you did
during our little break.

28:18.124 --> 28:19.324
I didn't do anything.

28:19.325 --> 28:20.692
I wasn't
even with Madison.

28:20.693 --> 28:22.127
What?

28:22.128 --> 28:23.428
Not on break,
not last summer.

28:23.429 --> 28:25.230
You know what?
You are the worst liar.

28:25.231 --> 28:26.731
I know.

28:26.732 --> 28:28.700
Just tell me everything
and get it over with.

28:28.701 --> 28:29.668
All right.

28:30.837 --> 28:34.172
Madison and I, we...
tested the waters.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.274
We made out a little bit.
That was it.

28:36.275 --> 28:37.943
I'm going to guess
that "testing the waters"

28:37.944 --> 28:39.411
went a little deeper
than that.

28:39.412 --> 28:40.779
Maybe waist-high?

28:40.780 --> 28:42.447
No, no. Grace, no.
We kissed.

28:42.448 --> 28:43.748
That was it.

28:43.749 --> 28:46.718
She was jealous of you,
I was jealous of Jason.

28:46.719 --> 28:48.553
One thing led to another,
and we kissed.

28:48.554 --> 28:50.422
So that's it? You just kissed?

28:50.423 --> 28:52.224
You kissed or you made out?

28:52.225 --> 28:53.992
We just kissed.
More than once?

28:53.993 --> 28:55.260
Not more than one occasion.

28:55.261 --> 28:56.495
It was more than one kiss?

28:56.496 --> 28:57.629
I hate these discussions.

28:57.630 --> 28:59.231
Why do you want
to go into detail?

28:59.232 --> 29:01.466
Because I want to compare.
Compare what?

29:01.467 --> 29:03.535
What you and Madison did
to what Jason and I did.

29:04.804 --> 29:06.404
We just kissed.

29:06.405 --> 29:07.439
I don't believe this.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.573
What?

29:08.574 --> 29:10.041
I don't believe
that I felt guilty

29:10.042 --> 29:11.343
about kissing Madison

29:11.344 --> 29:13.278
and all this time
you kissed Jason?

29:13.279 --> 29:15.180
That's all I did.
it was just a quick kiss.

29:15.181 --> 29:16.748
Yeah, I bet.
It was.

29:16.749 --> 29:18.383
I don't believe you.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.987
Ben!

29:21.988 --> 29:23.188
Hey, Ben!

29:23.189 --> 29:25.157
Ben! Ben!

29:25.158 --> 29:26.558
Benito!

29:55.221 --> 29:56.321
Hello.

29:56.322 --> 29:58.323
Where the hell is my Mercedes?

29:59.492 --> 30:01.826
I've got them now.

30:11.318 --> 30:13.586
You know you can't drive
without the key to the car.

30:13.587 --> 30:14.687
I forgot.

30:14.688 --> 30:15.821
And didn't you see her?

30:15.822 --> 30:16.989
She wasn't exactly
driving.

30:16.990 --> 30:18.024
It was
more like puttering.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.126
Is there an exception
for puttering?

30:20.127 --> 30:21.260
No, there's not.

30:21.261 --> 30:23.195
And you all know
better, I'm sure.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.430
Aren't you all
about the age

30:24.431 --> 30:25.531
where you're
in Driver's Ed?

30:25.532 --> 30:26.999
Yes.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.200
I should give you all
a ticket.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.935
What?
We don't even know her.

30:29.936 --> 30:32.705
We don't. Not really.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.307
We don't know anyone.

30:34.308 --> 30:36.309
We don't have boyfriends,
either.

30:40.514 --> 30:41.547
Hello.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.581
It's Dr. Bink.

30:42.582 --> 30:43.716
It's over, Henry.

30:43.717 --> 30:44.984
Don't bother
going to the beach.

30:44.985 --> 30:46.118
They're all
headed back here.

30:46.119 --> 30:47.353
So if you're smart,

30:47.354 --> 30:49.021
you'll tell Alice
to turn the car around

30:49.022 --> 30:50.289
and come back to school.

30:50.290 --> 30:52.458
We can't ride with her.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.129
Let me guess. You're all
supposed to be in school.

30:57.130 --> 31:00.900
You couldn't give us
a ride, could you?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.301
Please, sir?

31:02.302 --> 31:03.803
I could follow.

31:05.806 --> 31:07.173
I'm going to kill that kid.

31:07.174 --> 31:08.841
Ah, come on, Leo.
It's not so bad.

31:08.842 --> 31:09.942
It's a brand-new Mercedes.

31:09.943 --> 31:11.410
He doesn't have
a driver's license.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.645
Maybe he wasn't
driving the car.

31:12.646 --> 31:14.814
Maybe he let Jack
or Ricky drive the car.

31:14.815 --> 31:17.683
Like I said,
I'm going to kill that kid.

31:20.987 --> 31:22.021
What's up?

31:22.022 --> 31:23.489
What's up?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.524
My 14-year-old skipped school.

31:25.525 --> 31:27.460
My 16-year-old
and wife skipped town.

31:27.461 --> 31:28.928
What are you talking about?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.296
I made the mistake
of asking Anne

31:30.297 --> 31:32.331
if there was any possibility
the baby might not be mine.

31:32.332 --> 31:33.399
Why would you do that?

31:33.400 --> 31:34.734
Yeah, there's ways to do that

31:34.735 --> 31:36.335
without coming out
and asking her.

31:36.336 --> 31:37.670
I don't think the baby's mine.

31:37.671 --> 31:38.938
Robbie doesn't look
anything like me.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.506
He doesn't even look
that much like Anne.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.742
So Anne took the baby
and went to see her mother.

31:42.743 --> 31:44.844
She and Amy.
She took Amy and John, too.

31:44.845 --> 31:46.245
But they're coming back.

31:46.246 --> 31:47.713
I don't know
if they're coming back.

31:47.714 --> 31:49.782
I don't even know if they
know they're coming back.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.250
Geez, George,
why didn't you call me?

31:51.251 --> 31:53.452
Why didn't you call me?
This is terrible news.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.254
Is it?
What do you mean?

31:55.255 --> 31:57.523
You don't really want Ben
to stay with Amy, do you?

31:57.524 --> 32:00.393
He's 16. He doesn't
have to tie himself down
to a family at 16.

32:00.394 --> 32:02.862
it would be a lot easier
for him in the long run

32:02.863 --> 32:04.196
if Amy did leave.

32:04.197 --> 32:06.132
Uh, what about
the father of the baby?

32:06.133 --> 32:07.466
What about Ricky?

32:07.467 --> 32:09.301
Amy can't just take off.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.603
That baby has a father.

32:10.604 --> 32:12.171
The father has rights.

32:12.172 --> 32:13.973
Did you try to get rights
with Adrian?

32:13.974 --> 32:16.208
No. I made a mistake.

32:16.209 --> 32:18.010
I made lots of mistakes.

32:18.011 --> 32:19.645
But I've learned
from my mistakes.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.714
It takes a wise man
to learn from his mistakes

32:21.715 --> 32:24.550
and a wiser man to learn
from the mistakes of others.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.420
Maybe if we shared
some of our mistakes
with them,

32:27.421 --> 32:29.955
Ben and Ricky could be
smarter than any of us
were.

32:29.956 --> 32:31.290
You really haven't
made any mistakes.

32:31.291 --> 32:33.225
I've made mistakes.
Ruben's made mistakes.

32:33.226 --> 32:34.193
We should talk to them.

32:34.194 --> 32:35.828
What's your interest in this?

32:35.829 --> 32:37.062
My daughter.

32:37.063 --> 32:38.998
If the guys would just
make sound decisions

32:38.999 --> 32:40.132
about their lives,

32:40.133 --> 32:41.700
how much better off
would our daughters be?

32:41.701 --> 32:43.169
You see how it is
with women.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.437
One of them has a problem,

32:44.438 --> 32:45.805
the other women
in their lives--

32:45.806 --> 32:47.673
the mother or the grandmother,
the aunt, the friends--

32:47.674 --> 32:48.908
they all come around.

32:48.909 --> 32:50.876
But with guys-- --

32:50.877 --> 32:54.547
we think we have to do
everything all by ourselves,

32:54.548 --> 32:56.982
that it's a sign of weakness
to ask for help.

32:56.983 --> 32:57.983
Yeah, it is.

32:57.984 --> 32:59.084
Come on.

32:59.085 --> 33:00.252
You know what he's
talking about.

33:00.253 --> 33:01.720
Yeah, I know
what he's talking about,

33:01.721 --> 33:02.922
all too well.

33:02.923 --> 33:04.323
How much younger?

33:04.324 --> 33:05.958
He's not that much younger.

33:05.959 --> 33:07.560
He's very mature.

33:07.561 --> 33:10.663
Yeah. Maturity is a strong
quality in a man.

33:10.664 --> 33:12.731
I swear, Grace has never
skipped school before,

33:12.732 --> 33:14.033
and I just think
she's upset

33:14.034 --> 33:15.601
about me and my new
boyfriend.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.703
I think she's upset
and her and Jack broke up.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.104
Over oral sex.

33:19.105 --> 33:20.439
Excuse me?

33:20.440 --> 33:21.574
That's what I heard.

33:21.575 --> 33:23.909
What?
It's all over school.

33:23.910 --> 33:26.111
You just got here.
Yeah.

33:26.112 --> 33:27.480
I thought they decided

33:27.481 --> 33:29.048
they weren't ready
for a serious relationship,

33:29.049 --> 33:31.016
and that's why Grace
broke up with Jack.

33:31.017 --> 33:34.019
Come on. You don't
really believe that.
I did.

33:34.020 --> 33:35.888
He wanted it.
She didn't want to do it.

33:35.889 --> 33:38.724
It's almost impossible
to know what to tell them
these days.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.393
I'd almost rather
they have oral sex
than sex.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.095
She couldn't get pregnant.

33:43.096 --> 33:44.663
But then,
if they have oral sex,

33:44.664 --> 33:47.099
then she could get an STD.
Ha.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.568
Uh, what's the Christian
thought on that,

33:49.569 --> 33:50.903
on oral sex?

33:50.904 --> 33:52.805
The thought is oral sex

33:52.806 --> 33:55.174
or any kind of sex
before marriage is wrong.

33:55.175 --> 33:56.842
The reality is teens
are doing it anyway--

33:56.843 --> 33:58.511
not all teens,
but a lot of teens,

33:58.512 --> 33:59.712
and Christian teens, too,

33:59.713 --> 34:02.081
and...Christian adults

34:02.082 --> 34:04.917
and Christian...parents

34:04.918 --> 34:06.151
and--

34:06.152 --> 34:08.254
Give me a break,
okay? I'm a widow.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.723
No judgment.
I'm just trying to keep
the kids in the classroom

34:10.724 --> 34:12.157
and out of the bedroom.

34:12.158 --> 34:13.492
Aren't we all.

34:16.897 --> 34:18.831
Why do you look so familiar?

34:18.831 --> 34:20.533
Perhaps you saw me
on the evening news

34:20.534 --> 34:23.135
receiving an award for my work
with high school students.

34:23.136 --> 34:25.304
No. I don't think that's it.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.074
Hello, gentlemen.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.143
So I hear the boys
skipped school

34:31.143 --> 34:32.277
and went to the beach.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.380
Those rascals.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.947
Boys will be boys.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.449
And isn't it refreshing
that this time

34:37.449 --> 34:40.286
none of them are in trouble
for sex, drugs, or alcohol?

34:40.286 --> 34:42.154
I remember back
when I was a lad.

34:42.155 --> 34:44.290
A few of my buddies
and I dropped acid

34:44.291 --> 34:45.623
and hit the beach.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.092
We thought
we were at the beach.

34:47.092 --> 34:48.761
We were just sitting
in the neighbor's driveway

34:48.762 --> 34:50.062
until the popo pulled up.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.533
Ah, sobriety.
It has its rewards.

34:54.534 --> 34:56.168
Aren't you Reverend Stone?

34:56.168 --> 34:58.003
Yes, Jack's dad.

34:58.004 --> 35:00.439
Uh, this is Leo,
Ben's dad.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.807
That's Ruben, Adrian's dad.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.176
Nice to meet you, even
under these circumstances.

35:14.854 --> 35:15.921
Thank you.

35:17.691 --> 35:18.924
Welcome back.

35:27.955 --> 35:29.355
You were
just at the beach.

35:29.356 --> 35:31.291
I didn't know that's
where we were going.

35:31.292 --> 35:33.359
I just wanted
to get out of school.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.394
Don't I have enough problems

35:34.395 --> 35:35.428
without you
getting out of school?

35:35.429 --> 35:36.462
Yeah.

35:38.265 --> 35:39.799
Did you talk to Mom today?

35:39.800 --> 35:40.800
Yeah, I talked to her.

35:40.801 --> 35:42.101
Are they coming home
tomorrow?

35:42.102 --> 35:44.103
I don't think so.
What are they going to do?

35:44.104 --> 35:45.672
I guess it depends
on whose baby it is.

35:45.673 --> 35:47.006
If Robbie is your baby?

35:48.309 --> 35:49.776
Just because he doesn't
look like you

35:49.777 --> 35:50.810
doesn't mean
he's not your son.

35:50.811 --> 35:52.545
Yeah, it does.
Dad.

35:52.546 --> 35:55.081
Ash, life is complicated.

35:55.082 --> 35:56.282
No, it's not.

35:56.283 --> 35:58.017
You love Mom,
and you love Robbie.

35:58.018 --> 36:00.620
You love Amy and John,
and you love me.

36:00.621 --> 36:04.257
So make it uncomplicated
and get them back here.

36:05.459 --> 36:07.527
Don't skip school again.

36:07.528 --> 36:09.395
I don't know why Dr. Bink
didn't suspend you,

36:09.396 --> 36:10.997
but don't tempt her
with a next time,
you hear me?

36:10.998 --> 36:13.533
Yeah, I hear you. Good night.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.574
Come on.

36:23.177 --> 36:24.243
What?

36:24.244 --> 36:26.145
You don't listen to me,
either.

36:26.146 --> 36:27.180
Lou, sit.

36:28.649 --> 36:29.682
Thank you.

36:31.051 --> 36:33.119
Give me the illusion
of control over something.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.153
Oh--

36:34.154 --> 36:35.655
Here's the thing, honey.

36:35.656 --> 36:38.825
I know you've got
raging hormones,

36:38.826 --> 36:41.527
but if you really
have to have sex

36:41.528 --> 36:44.163
and you just
can't go without it,

36:44.164 --> 36:45.565
why can't you just
masturbate?

36:45.566 --> 36:48.434
Oh, that's a word nobody wants
to hear their mothers say.

36:48.435 --> 36:51.070
Grace, I know this
is an uncomfortable
conversation to have,

36:51.071 --> 36:54.207
but I'm just thinking
that if you could...

36:54.208 --> 36:56.576
take matters
into your own hands,

36:56.577 --> 36:59.412
you might be...saner?

37:00.647 --> 37:01.614
It's kind of funny,

37:01.615 --> 37:03.683
taking matters
into my own hands.

37:03.684 --> 37:06.052
I'm glad. I'm glad
you think it's funny

37:06.053 --> 37:07.220
because you know what?

37:07.221 --> 37:08.488
Sometimes sex is funny.

37:08.489 --> 37:11.624
And we have to laugh
at our own pathetic
situations.

37:11.625 --> 37:15.528
We do, and I'm a widow,
and I like--

37:15.529 --> 37:19.232
and I want to have sex,
and I am crazy about Jeff.

37:19.233 --> 37:21.300
But I don't want to get
married again right now.

37:21.301 --> 37:22.869
I mean, not that he's asked.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.804
So you?
Oh, yeah.

37:26.907 --> 37:28.608
And she just showed up
at the beach?

37:28.609 --> 37:29.776
Yeah.

37:29.777 --> 37:31.177
I mean, she was looking

37:31.178 --> 37:32.545
at a travel book
on California

37:32.546 --> 37:34.013
when I first saw her--

37:34.014 --> 37:35.782
in Bologna, at the cafe.

37:35.783 --> 37:38.484
And I showed her
where we like to hang out.

37:38.485 --> 37:41.421
I didn't know if she'd ever
actually come to California.

37:41.422 --> 37:43.723
I-- I mean, I--
I found out recently

37:43.724 --> 37:46.092
that she was coming
or that she wanted to come,

37:46.093 --> 37:49.061
but now she's here
with her dad.

37:49.062 --> 37:51.230
And who is this girl,
exactly? Just a friend?

37:51.231 --> 37:52.799
Yeah. Just a friend.
Really?

37:52.800 --> 37:55.067
Because you know what, Ben?
It's okay to have friends.

37:55.068 --> 37:56.369
It's really okay.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.271
It's even okay
to be in love with Amy

37:58.272 --> 37:59.972
and still be attracted
to other girls.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.608
You're going to be
attracted to other girls.

38:02.609 --> 38:04.644
That doesn't mean you have
to do anything about it.

38:04.645 --> 38:06.512
I told you before,

38:06.513 --> 38:07.980
if you have done something
about it,

38:07.981 --> 38:09.215
keep that stuff to yourself.

38:09.216 --> 38:11.451
I don't want to know,
and neither does Amy.

38:11.452 --> 38:13.719
I do love her-- Amy.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.956
But I want to be
with other girls.

38:16.957 --> 38:18.291
I want to date

38:18.292 --> 38:21.694
and have sex outside
of a committed relationship.

38:21.695 --> 38:23.463
You mean like any other
16-year-old guy

38:23.464 --> 38:25.631
that doesn't have
a girlfriend with a baby.

38:25.632 --> 38:26.933
I love John. He's great.

38:26.934 --> 38:28.835
But yeah.

38:28.836 --> 38:29.769
Ben.

38:30.938 --> 38:32.405
I know sometimes in life,

38:32.406 --> 38:35.041
you'd rather
ignore a challenge
than deal with it.

38:35.042 --> 38:37.477
But you have to deal with it.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.278
Amy has a baby.

38:39.279 --> 38:41.047
If you're in a relationship
with Amy,

38:41.048 --> 38:42.348
you have a baby, too.

38:42.349 --> 38:44.584
You've always seemed to have
real feelings for her,

38:44.585 --> 38:46.052
despite her situation.

38:46.053 --> 38:48.187
I know you had
your doubts once, but--

38:48.188 --> 38:49.856
But I just want
to have some fun.

38:49.857 --> 38:51.524
I can always
go back to Amy.

38:51.525 --> 38:52.825
What?
Oh, my God.

38:52.826 --> 38:54.227
Did I
just say that out loud?

38:54.228 --> 38:56.329
Yes, you did,
and no, you can't, son.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.564
You really can't
always go back.

38:58.565 --> 39:00.032
So be sure this time.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.335
You broke up with Amy before,
so be sure this time

39:02.336 --> 39:04.604
because next time
she may not take you back.

39:04.605 --> 39:07.540
You can only go back and forth
so many times like this

39:07.541 --> 39:09.609
before you lose
a woman forever.

39:12.846 --> 39:14.514
I have to go.
I know.

39:17.251 --> 39:19.585
I'm sorry
about your situation
with Amy and John.

39:19.586 --> 39:21.187
I'm sure you can
work it out.

39:21.188 --> 39:22.255
Ahem.

39:23.490 --> 39:24.724
Sorry to interrupt.

39:24.725 --> 39:27.593
I just wanted to talk
to Ricky for a minute.

39:27.594 --> 39:29.428
About?
Dad stuff.

39:33.333 --> 39:34.634
Good night.

39:39.306 --> 39:40.973
If you don't want me
to come over--

39:40.974 --> 39:43.009
No, no. I'd rather
you come over here

39:43.010 --> 39:44.610
than Adrian go
over to your place.

39:44.611 --> 39:45.711
Oh.

39:45.712 --> 39:47.813
So I talked to George
today at school.

39:47.814 --> 39:49.849
I didn't realize
Amy had left town.

39:49.850 --> 39:52.251
It's probably not for good,
or I hope it isn't.

39:52.252 --> 39:54.287
Still,
it's got to be difficult

39:54.288 --> 39:55.655
thinking
about the possibility

39:55.656 --> 39:57.757
that she could leave town
and take your son with her

39:57.758 --> 39:59.258
I can't go to court.

39:59.259 --> 40:00.826
You could mediate
a legal agreement

40:00.827 --> 40:01.928
without going to court.

40:01.929 --> 40:03.062
You should have
an agreement.

40:03.063 --> 40:04.564
And you might
want to look at it

40:04.565 --> 40:05.765
as a commitment
to your son.

40:05.766 --> 40:07.633
I might want to look
at it that way,

40:07.634 --> 40:09.502
but what it is
is a message to Amy

40:09.503 --> 40:10.970
that she can't do
anything she wants.

40:10.971 --> 40:12.171
And I'm not so sure

40:12.172 --> 40:14.173
she shouldn't be able
to do anything she wants.

40:14.174 --> 40:15.408
She's his mother,

40:15.409 --> 40:17.476
and I'm not contributing
much in the way of money,

40:17.477 --> 40:19.078
so--
So what?

40:19.079 --> 40:20.546
You're not a father?

40:20.547 --> 40:21.881
You're afraid that at 16

40:21.882 --> 40:23.950
if you can't make some
sort of payment to Amy,

40:23.951 --> 40:25.618
you can't get rights
to see the baby,

40:25.619 --> 40:27.386
so you'd rather not
risk it right now

40:27.387 --> 40:29.055
and wait
until you have money.

40:29.056 --> 40:30.690
It's not about the money.

40:30.691 --> 40:32.458
I'm not saying you should
be financially responsible

40:32.459 --> 40:34.360
when it comes to your son,

40:34.361 --> 40:37.063
but I always paid
child support for Adrian.

40:37.064 --> 40:38.831
I was just
never there for her.

40:38.832 --> 40:42.134
So what kind of a father
am I?

40:42.135 --> 40:43.970
A father who never
knew his daughter

40:43.971 --> 40:45.204
until she was 16.

40:45.205 --> 40:47.206
Children need things,

40:47.207 --> 40:49.842
but they also need
your time, your help,

40:49.843 --> 40:51.944
and your love.

40:51.945 --> 40:54.447
Learn from my mistakes,
Ricky.

40:54.448 --> 40:56.882
Find a way to be
in your kid's life.

40:56.883 --> 40:57.984
You're a dad.

40:59.119 --> 41:01.554
And you're a good dad.

41:01.555 --> 41:04.724
You and Amy will find a way
to do what's best for John.

41:04.725 --> 41:05.925
You will.

41:05.926 --> 41:09.028
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you that.

41:09.029 --> 41:11.998
And to tell you that if
you ever wanted to talk,

41:11.999 --> 41:13.866
I'm right downstairs
from Adrian.

41:13.867 --> 41:14.934
Thanks.

41:14.935 --> 41:16.402
Good night.

41:23.510 --> 41:25.011
We're out of dog food.

41:31.518 --> 41:33.853
Look,
I don't want any trouble,

41:33.854 --> 41:36.555
but I want my son back here
as soon as possible,

41:36.556 --> 41:38.124
if you don't mind
telling Amy that.

41:38.125 --> 41:40.459
You tell Amy that.
I'll back you up.

41:40.460 --> 41:41.794
Thanks.

41:41.795 --> 41:43.429
What else is on your mind?

41:43.430 --> 41:45.297
It's just that if Ben
breaks up with Amy

41:45.298 --> 41:46.999
and I've insisted
Amy has to be here--

41:47.000 --> 41:48.234
Then you'll feel obligated

41:48.235 --> 41:50.102
to be her boyfriend
or husband or something?

41:50.103 --> 41:51.771
You told me before
how you feel about Amy.

41:51.772 --> 41:53.806
You really have to tell Amy
how you feel about Amy

41:53.807 --> 41:55.641
in a nice way
that won't make her cry.

41:55.642 --> 41:56.942
She cries very easily,
you know.

41:56.943 --> 41:59.311
I know, But I don't want her
to get rejected by Ben

41:59.312 --> 42:00.479
and then rejected by me.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.647
She's been through enough.

42:01.648 --> 42:03.315
Maybe she doesn't want
either one of you.

42:03.316 --> 42:04.383
Ever think about that?

42:04.384 --> 42:05.451
She's not having any trouble

42:05.452 --> 42:07.119
thinking about being
away from you or Ben.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.287
I love that girl.

42:08.288 --> 42:09.522
And I love you.

42:09.523 --> 42:10.589
And I love my grandson

42:10.590 --> 42:12.058
maybe more
than the both of you,

42:12.059 --> 42:14.326
so you and Amy have to do
what's right for John.

42:14.327 --> 42:16.529
And if you need my help
with that, you got it.

42:17.931 --> 42:20.533
Call her.
She won't pick up.
I tried calling her.

42:20.534 --> 42:22.268
Speed dial.

42:24.805 --> 42:26.472
I want to take
a nice long bath.

42:26.473 --> 42:27.807
You'll
listen for Robbie?

42:27.808 --> 42:29.375
Yeah, of course.

42:32.814 --> 42:36.698
-Dad? -No, it's not your dad. It's me.
I want to see my son, Amy.

42:36.699 --> 42:39.227
- I want you to bring John home.
- Yeah, when I'm ready.

42:39.228 --> 42:41.540
- And when's that going to be?
- I don't Know.
