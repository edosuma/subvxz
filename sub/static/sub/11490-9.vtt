WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:09.100
It's Mom.

00:09.130 --> 00:11.460
Say hi for me.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.560
Hi, Mom. Alan wants to talk to you.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.290
Hi, Mom. How was Dubai?

00:21.300 --> 00:24.500
Oh, good, I-I'm glad you met somebody.

00:24.510 --> 00:28.350
Yes, yes, they are a hairy people.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.590
Uh, yeah, I-I don't need to know any more
details, as long as he makes you happy.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.620
That's a detail, Mom.

00:38.630 --> 00:39.950
Oh, no, d-don't worry about your house.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.820
I, uh, I check on it every
day on my way home from work.

00:42.830 --> 00:46.520
Yeah, now, that's why I'm the good son.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.140
Well, uh... have fun with Hamid.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.770
That's another detail, Mom.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.810
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.390
Okay, bye-bye.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.610
You haven't been to her
house once, have you?

00:59.630 --> 01:02.350
I checked on it with Google
Earth. It's still there.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.709
At least the roof is anyway.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.220
I'll just run over today and pick
up the newspapers and the mail,

01:07.230 --> 01:10.210
and, uh, replace the dead plants.

01:10.220 --> 01:11.890
You don't think she'll
notice new plants?

01:11.900 --> 01:15.050
Nah, she doesn't pay that much
attention to living things.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.080
Remember when she had the cockatoo?

01:17.090 --> 01:18.340
Oh, yeah.

01:18.350 --> 01:21.330
Polly really wanted a cracker.

01:21.670 --> 01:24.190
Hey, listen, as long as you're
going to be in Beverly Hills,

01:24.210 --> 01:26.390
you can drop my Mercedes off
at the dealership for service.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.280
Happy to do it.

01:27.290 --> 01:28.820
Hey, I don't want to hear it.

01:28.830 --> 01:29.900
You and your kid live here rent-free.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.560
I don't ask for much in return, so
the least you could do for me, Alan...

01:31.570 --> 01:33.110
Charlie, Charlie.

01:33.140 --> 01:36.210
I said I'm happy to do it.

01:37.530 --> 01:41.300
Damn, I was all set to bust your balls.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.840
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:43.860 --> 01:48.670
And just so we're clear, my car is cherry,
so if you bang it, ding it, dent it,

01:48.680 --> 01:51.840
or even change the ass-print in the seat,
just keep driving till you get to Mexico,

01:51.860 --> 01:55.170
then bury yourself in the desert.

01:55.830 --> 02:00.450
I understand your concern, and
trust me, I will be very careful.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.290
You know, you're taking
all the fun out of this.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.100
Okay, "get car serviced." Check.

02:12.820 --> 02:15.430
What's next?

02:15.710 --> 02:19.050
Oh, nap time.

02:26.610 --> 02:28.110
Check.

02:28.610 --> 02:34.640
Two and a half men

03:05.420 --> 03:07.560
What the hell are you doing?

03:10.790 --> 03:11.860
You okay?

03:11.870 --> 03:14.870
No, I landed on my ass bone.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.890
Sack up. You'll be fine.

03:16.900 --> 03:20.190
Would you grab my sunglasses
while you're down there?

03:21.760 --> 03:25.400
Recover sunglasses. Check.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.010
Here.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.900
Thks.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.790
What's so interesting over there?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.550
Nothing.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.880
Hey, you know the rule: if
there's topless sunbathers,

03:36.890 --> 03:38.950
you don't hang out and stare at them.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.930
You come get your Uncle Charlie.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.830
Nobody's topless.

03:44.770 --> 03:47.510
Then what are you looking at?

03:48.240 --> 03:51.140
Son of a bitch.

03:52.270 --> 03:54.660
Uncheck.

03:54.670 --> 03:56.140
Just some new neighbors.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.310
New neighbors, huh? What's the deal?

03:58.320 --> 04:01.050
- They making s'mores on the barbecue?
- No.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.370
Chicken?

04:02.380 --> 04:04.880
It has nothing to do with food.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.410
a girl. Is she cute?

04:08.420 --> 04:11.710
No, I'm hanging off the
balcony to look at a mutant.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.410
Don't get snippy. I was
just showing an interest.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.240
Why don't you go over there
and introduce yourself?

04:18.250 --> 04:19.790
I can't do that. It'd look desperate.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.190
You are desperate.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.900
Come on. We'll both go.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.120
Really?

04:25.130 --> 04:26.140
Yeah, why not?

04:26.150 --> 04:28.370
I got a little window
before my next nap.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.800
- Thanks.
- No problem.

04:30.810 --> 04:32.870
What am I going to say?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.770
I don't know. Try saying hello.

04:35.780 --> 04:37.990
Hello? That's all you got?

04:38.330 --> 04:41.320
That's all I got that you can use.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.710
I should have peed before we left.

04:48.470 --> 04:50.280
You've just got a nervous bladder.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.400
Wait till you turn. You'll feel like
you have to pee while you're still peeing.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.410
- You ready to do this?
- No.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.670
Oh, come on, what's the
worst thing that could happen?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.070
She laughs at me?

05:02.080 --> 05:05.000
Oh, that is so sweet.

05:05.770 --> 05:09.490
No, the worst thing that could happen is
she falls in love with you, you get married.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.620
Ten, 12 years later she comes to her
senses, leaves you, takes all your stuff,

05:12.640 --> 05:14.980
and you have to go live in your car.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.640
Yeah.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.510
What kind of car do you think I'll have?

05:26.480 --> 05:27.650
Hello.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.560
I'm Charlie Harper, and this is Jake.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.410
We live next door. Right, Jake?

05:31.420 --> 05:32.410
I'm Jake.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.310
Hi, I'm Celeste.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.440
I'm Jake.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.960
Honey, is that the cable guy?

05:37.970 --> 05:40.130
No, Dad, it's our neighbors.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.290
Jerome Burnett.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.810
Charlie Harper. This is my nephew Jake.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.750
We just came by to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.030
Well, that was very nice of you.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.580
Yeah, welcome to the neighborhood. Bye.

05:52.590 --> 05:55.750
Hang on. Hang on. Do
you know who this man is?

05:55.760 --> 05:58.030
Yeah, her dad. Bye.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.120
This is Jerome Burnett, one of
the great NFL players of all time.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.240
You're very kind. Thank you.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.950
- You know what his nickname was, Jake?
- No.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.250
Tell him.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.460
Mad Dog.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.980
That's great. Can I use your bathroom?

06:22.990 --> 06:25.520
- Honey, show him where it is.
- Come on, Jake.

06:25.930 --> 06:28.490
Lady in the house, Jake.
Put the seat back down.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.870
So what have you been to lately?

06:31.890 --> 06:33.320
Oh, still working for the Chargers.

06:33.330 --> 06:34.830
You know, mostly front office stuff.

06:34.840 --> 06:38.040
Really? So you probably have
access to tickets and such.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.670
I do. Do you want me to hook you up?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.830
Oh, gee, I don't want to impose.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.670
I just came by to say hello.
Can you get me a sky box?

06:47.820 --> 06:48.930
I'll see what I can do.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.680
That'd be great.

06:50.690 --> 06:54.930
And I'm guessing if a, if a player got injured,
you'd probably be one of the first to know about it.

06:54.940 --> 06:59.470
You know, even before the, uh,
what do you call 'em-- bookies?

06:59.870 --> 07:02.000
Don't push it, Charlie.

07:02.010 --> 07:05.860
Hey, Dad, would it be all right if
Jake and I take a walk on the beach?

07:05.870 --> 07:06.960
Yeah, sure, why not?

07:06.970 --> 07:09.570
Thanks. See you later.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.410
Isn't that nice?

07:17.420 --> 07:21.820
That boy touches my daughter,
I'm going to be touching you.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.980
Understood.

07:25.990 --> 07:28.570
Can I use your bathroom?

07:31.990 --> 07:33.250
Here you go, Mr. Harper.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.610
Oh, oh, thank you.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.330
cappuccino.

07:40.350 --> 07:43.620
I wonder what they're serving
at the domestic dealerships.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.370
They do take good care of you here.

07:45.380 --> 07:48.310
Of course, they ought to,
considering what we paid for our cars.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.420
Oh, yeah. They are expensive.

07:50.430 --> 07:53.210
Is that your CL65 outside?

07:53.410 --> 07:56.880
yes, it is mine.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.590
How do you like it?

07:59.600 --> 08:00.890
What's not to like?

08:00.900 --> 08:03.450
It does everything
but trim your toenails.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.290
Or maybe it does and I just
haven't found the button yet.

08:08.470 --> 08:11.300
Not that I need to trim my toenails.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.290
Did 'em last night. Over the tub.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.220
Clip, ping, clip, ping!

08:19.940 --> 08:21.680
Diane.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.850
Alan.

08:24.450 --> 08:25.810
So you live around here, Alan?

08:25.820 --> 08:27.360
Uh, no, I live down by the beach.

08:27.370 --> 08:28.210
Santa Monica?

08:28.220 --> 08:29.480
Uh, Malibu.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.400
Ooh, Malibu.

08:33.130 --> 08:36.030
Yep. Malibu.

08:36.909 --> 08:39.909
Yeah, uh, we just call it "the Boo."

08:42.590 --> 08:46.030
You know, like, "Hey, how
are things down at the Boo?"

08:46.930 --> 08:48.470
Mr. Harper, your car is ready.

08:48.490 --> 08:51.250
Oh, uh, thank you. I'll,
uh, I'll be right there.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.280
Well, uh, looks like I'm all done here.

08:53.290 --> 08:56.140
Guess I'll, uh, head back to the Boo.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.890
Don't rub it in. They told
me I'd be here all day.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.110
Oh, that's terrible.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.760
And I'm starving.

09:01.770 --> 09:06.940
Oh, well, they have the little croissants
and the, uh, and the chocolate chip cookies.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.880
Or, uh, maybe I could take
you out for a nice lunch.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.260
That would be lovely, Alan. Thank you.

09:14.270 --> 09:16.880
Well, terrific. Let's go.

09:18.270 --> 09:21.620
This never happened with the Volvo.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.780
It's 5:00.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.950
Thanks. I almost slept
through happy hour.

09:37.550 --> 09:38.880
Where's my little girl?

09:38.890 --> 09:39.970
They're not back yet?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.870
Why else would I be here?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.670
Honestly, I was thinking happy hour.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.010
Let me give Jake a call,
see what's keeping 'em.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.720
Yeah, you do that.

09:50.730 --> 09:51.700
Did you try calling your daughter?

09:51.710 --> 09:54.910
She left her cell phone at the house.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.910
Kids, huh?

09:57.490 --> 09:58.900
It's ringing.

09:58.910 --> 10:03.920
Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up

10:03.930 --> 10:07.160
Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up

10:07.170 --> 10:10.680
Oh, that's unfortunate
on so many levels.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.540
This is just
my pied- -terre.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.860
I spend most of my time
out at the beach house.

11:20.870 --> 11:22.560
Looks like you haven't
been here in a while.

11:22.570 --> 11:24.080
Oh, just two weeks.

11:24.090 --> 11:26.680
Don't you have someone to
come in to water your plants?

11:26.690 --> 11:30.280
Oh, I do, but he's
incredibly unreliable.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.430
My brother.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.790
A bit of a mooch.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.800
So, now that we're here,
what do you want to do?

11:38.810 --> 11:42.320
Ah, gee, I don't know, I...

11:43.100 --> 11:46.660
Oh, well, that's an option.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.250
Oh, excuse me.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.280
Alan Harper speaking.

11:59.290 --> 12:02.280
I know who's speaking, you dill weed.

12:02.290 --> 12:05.300
We've got a problem here.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.500
Oh, really?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.330
It's the mooch at the Boo.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.910
So, uh, what's the problem?

12:14.920 --> 12:18.040
Not the wine cellar again, is it?

12:18.700 --> 12:21.630
What are you talking
aut, you gibbering moron?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.230
Good, good.

12:25.970 --> 12:30.380
Listen to me, your idiot
son's about to get me killed.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.410
Oh, so he's okay?

12:32.430 --> 12:34.540
He's great. Probably
having the time of his life.

12:34.550 --> 12:35.940
I'm the one in trouble.

12:35.950 --> 12:39.670
Uh, well, I-I-I trust
you to take care of it.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.490
Thanks for the update.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.820
Take a bottle of Pinot for yourself.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.750
Alan?

12:52.700 --> 12:55.980
My God, I thought there was an eclipse.

12:56.950 --> 13:00.220
Excuse me, I need to go
to the bathroom again.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.380
I knew it. You're married.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.200
Oh, oh, no-no-no.
I'm not married.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.160
This is, uh, this is just, uh...

13:23.170 --> 13:25.940
A silk evening gown.

13:25.950 --> 13:28.650
Actually, I think it's chiffon.

13:28.660 --> 13:29.610
You men are all the same.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.180
No, no, no, wait. Diane, Diane...

13:32.070 --> 13:33.300
You've got the wrong idea.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.090
There's something you
don't know about me.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.780
- You're gay?
- No.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.450
- You're a
cross-dresser? - No.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.370
'Cause, you know, I could
really get into that.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.310
Yes!

13:44.910 --> 13:48.290
I'm a big, ol' cross-dresser.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.110
Sorry it took so long.
I had a little accident.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.940
Come on, you and me are going
to go out and find those kids.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.040
- Jerome, Jerome, hang on.
- What?

14:00.420 --> 14:03.460
Still pretty nimble.

14:04.420 --> 14:08.690
Let's sit down, take a deep breath,
and talk this through for a minute.

14:09.350 --> 14:13.920
Come on, big fella. Please?

14:15.920 --> 14:18.010
Make it quick.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.450
Okay, here's the deal.

14:20.460 --> 14:24.090
Jake is harmless.You don't
have a thing to worry about,

14:24.100 --> 14:27.050
unless your daughter's
made out of doughnuts.

14:29.050 --> 14:32.290
Which I'm assuming she's not.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.200
Look, Celeste is all I've got.

14:34.210 --> 14:36.500
You don't know what it's
like being a single father.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.410
You're right. I don't.

14:38.420 --> 14:43.220
But I do know what it's like to
exploit women with daddy issues.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.320
What the hell are you talking about?

14:45.330 --> 14:48.280
Believe me, if you don't trust your
daughter to make her own decisions,

14:48.290 --> 14:51.690
if you try to control her life, she's
just going to grow up to resent you.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.070
And the next thing you know,

14:53.090 --> 14:58.840
she'll be trying to punish you by going out with
some weaselly little con artist like, well, me.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.970
And you can't kill us all.

15:04.510 --> 15:07.660
I can try.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.350
Let me start again.

15:12.450 --> 15:15.290
Uh, uh, uh, are you sure
this is what you want?

15:15.300 --> 15:20.130
Oh, yeah, baby. It's always
been one of my fantasies.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.460
Oh, okay.Just a little heads-up:

15:22.470 --> 15:25.680
I'm wearing the panties,
but I'm not bikini-safe.

15:25.730 --> 15:29.700
Ugh, my ass looks huge in this.

15:32.370 --> 15:34.000
Diane?

15:39.140 --> 15:44.050
Oh, no.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.390
Oh, no!

15:51.390 --> 15:53.640
Not bad.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.410
Oh, no! Oh, no!

16:02.640 --> 16:05.070
Yes, yes, my car has been stolen.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.040
Yes, just now. If you hurry, you ca...

16:08.290 --> 16:10.650
Sure, I'll hold.

16:11.050 --> 16:14.820
Why am I not surprised?

16:16.010 --> 16:19.370
Did it have to be my red chiffon?

16:26.220 --> 16:30.420
Then after I blew out
my knee, my wife left me.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.610
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.500
For a place kicker.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.480
Ooh, insult to injury.

16:39.490 --> 16:43.270
A little, tiny dude from Serbia.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.740
Not a single vowel in his entire name.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.940
Oh, yeah, Grl Zrbnck.

16:52.370 --> 16:55.940
That guy could sure split the uprights.

16:55.950 --> 16:59.480
In a football manner of speaking.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.080
And ever since then, it's
just been me and Celeste.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.510
Sure, sure.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.099
I don't know what I'd do if anything
ever happened to her, Charlie.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.000
I'd go crazy.

17:10.010 --> 17:13.190
I'd go crazy just thinking about it.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.630
Well, then, for God's
sake, don't think about it.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.450
Come on. Come on. Let's get you home.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.900
Thanks, Charlie. You're okay.

17:28.910 --> 17:30.540
No problem.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.670
You just kick back and relax.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.060
And when Celeste walks through that door, all
you've got to do is act like nothing's happened.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.220
You think something happened?

17:39.230 --> 17:41.990
No, no, no, nothing happened.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.840
Which is why it's not really acting.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.720
And it will show your
daughter that you trust her.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.840
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.240
You won't be sorry. I promise.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.780
Okay. Hey, come over to the house.

17:53.790 --> 17:56.970
I've got a couple of tickets for
Sunday's game I want to lay on you.

17:56.980 --> 18:00.960
Oh, you don't have to do that. I'll
just grab my keys. Okay, let's go.

18:04.430 --> 18:07.100
Whatever happened to the guy you
tackled in the Tampa Bay game?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.920
Robinson? He's walking again.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.750
Celeste!

18:14.120 --> 18:16.340
Hi, Dad.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.790
Hey, Mr. Mad Dog.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.610
Am I going to be walking again?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.100
Listen, Jake.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.910
I'm real proud that you stepped
up and got a little action tonight,

18:36.920 --> 18:39.890
- but I've got to ask you something.
- What?

18:39.900 --> 18:42.350
Are you out of your freakin' mind?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.140
I'm sorry. We just lost track of time.

18:46.150 --> 18:50.300
Yeah, well, thanks to you, I've got to
change my shorts for the second time today.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.960
Oh, there's my phone.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.960
- Who are you calling?
- Celeste.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.370
No-no, no, no, no, no,
cool it with Celeste.

19:00.380 --> 19:03.580
And change your ringtone.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.230
Now what?

19:19.150 --> 19:22.170
I'll be with you in a minute.

19:22.180 --> 19:24.140
Jake, go to your room.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.680
No matter what you
hear, do not come out.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.950
- What?
- Just go!

19:35.370 --> 19:37.780
Look, I spoke to the kid.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.240
He's not going to bother
your daughter anymore.

19:39.250 --> 19:43.670
So whatever you gotta do, do it to me.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.370
I'm sorry, buddy.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.560
I overreacted.

19:49.570 --> 19:50.730
Okay.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.360
Celeste told me everything.

19:52.370 --> 19:56.100
She told me your boy was a perfect
gentleman and that she wanted to kiss him.

19:56.110 --> 19:58.850
She wanted to kiss him?

19:59.480 --> 20:02.480
You may have bigger
problems than you thought.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.150
Hey, here's two tickets for the game.

20:05.180 --> 20:07.900
You take Jake;I'll bring
Celeste. We'll make a day of it.

20:07.910 --> 20:10.490
Oh, thanks. That's... that's great!

20:10.520 --> 20:12.920
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

20:23.070 --> 20:26.280
Okay, well...See you Sunday.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.220
Alan! Where's my car?!

20:33.650 --> 20:36.640
Why are you wearing a dress?!

20:36.650 --> 20:38.230
Alan!

20:38.240 --> 20:40.370
Why aren't you in Mexico?!

20:41.305 --> 20:47.379
