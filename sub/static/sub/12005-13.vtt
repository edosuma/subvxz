WEBVTT

00:01.708 --> 00:02.775
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.809 --> 00:04.477
I'm just really glad to
be here. You have no idea.

00:04.511 --> 00:06.512
- We're happy to have you.
- To Regina

00:06.547 --> 00:09.549
and a great first day.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.484
I had a stack of resumes this high.

00:11.518 --> 00:13.219
I have too many needy clients

00:13.253 --> 00:15.354
to worry about whether or not my
sales clerks have their act together.

00:15.389 --> 00:17.190
You've got an opening in your office.

00:17.224 --> 00:19.392
- What about Nikki?
- I'm happy to have you.

00:19.426 --> 00:22.061
I just found my next thing... signing.

00:22.095 --> 00:24.397
- You can't learn to sign in a month.
- Watch me.

00:24.431 --> 00:27.266
Do you know how easy it
was when you were gone?

00:27.301 --> 00:29.168
You deserted me!

00:29.203 --> 00:30.269
They were there!

00:30.304 --> 00:31.337
Please stay.

00:31.371 --> 00:33.105
I'd like my family with me.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.075
Regina's staying at
Angelo's for a few days.

00:36.109 --> 00:38.377
I guess she needed some alone time.

00:38.412 --> 00:40.179
Can I stay the night?

00:40.214 --> 00:42.915
You can stay as long as you want.

00:49.923 --> 00:51.324
Oh. Sorry.

00:51.358 --> 00:54.260
We said we were gonna clean up.

00:54.294 --> 00:56.262
It's all right.

00:56.296 --> 00:58.264
Morning! Oh...

00:58.298 --> 01:00.066
We were totally supposed to do those.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.934
It's fine. Just next time

01:01.969 --> 01:03.803
if you don't have time to do the dishes,

01:03.837 --> 01:06.706
let them soak overnight. It
makes them a lot easier to clean.

01:07.941 --> 01:09.775
I'm sorry. Can I help?

01:09.810 --> 01:11.077
No, I'm almost done.

01:12.679 --> 01:13.913
Hey, where's the biscotti?

01:13.947 --> 01:16.749
- Breakfast of champions.
- No no no, don't eat that.

01:16.783 --> 01:20.052
I'll make us a real breakfast.
How about some crêpes?

01:20.087 --> 01:23.656
That sounds great, but I actually
have to pick something up before work.

01:23.690 --> 01:25.558
- So...
- And I've gotta get dressed.

01:25.592 --> 01:27.593
I've got a meeting at the temp agency.

01:27.628 --> 01:29.662
Okay, so I'll make
something for dinner tonight.

01:31.698 --> 01:34.600
- Sounds great.
- Cool.

01:38.605 --> 01:42.742
I have never seen somebody
attack a pot like that.

01:42.776 --> 01:43.843
He was just like...

01:44.878 --> 01:46.612
you're missing my Angelo impersonation.

01:46.647 --> 01:48.614
Sorry. What?

01:48.649 --> 01:50.683
- Do it again.
- Never mind.

01:50.717 --> 01:52.685
What's with the photo essay of your amps?

01:52.719 --> 01:55.421
- Putting 'em on eBay.
- You're selling your amps?

02:01.428 --> 02:02.728
Hey, Joe, what's up?

02:04.398 --> 02:06.399
It's okay. Mr. Hilliard says

02:06.433 --> 02:08.567
that we dent his car every
time he gets it washed.

02:08.602 --> 02:10.303
Yeah, the dent's been there for years.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.204
My dad has a photo of Hilliard's car

02:12.239 --> 02:14.173
in the bookshelf in his office.

02:14.207 --> 02:15.608
Yeah, just call me back
if there's any problems.

02:15.642 --> 02:17.343
All right, bye.

02:17.377 --> 02:19.478
Well done.

02:19.513 --> 02:22.148
Whoa. You're selling the Fender, too?

02:22.182 --> 02:24.150
Well, I don't need eight guitars,

02:24.184 --> 02:27.386
plus the wedding is costing a
lot more than we thought it would.

02:27.421 --> 02:30.156
Can't you guys just ask
mom and dad for help?

02:30.190 --> 02:32.358
Nikki wants us to do it on our own.

02:32.392 --> 02:35.061
But aren't you guys gonna
play after you get married?

02:35.095 --> 02:37.129
Well, I don't need all of my equipment,

02:37.164 --> 02:40.099
- plus we'll be setting
up the apartment and...

02:43.203 --> 02:44.437
Hey, babe, what's up?

02:46.106 --> 02:47.506
Uh, I wish I could.

02:49.042 --> 02:51.110
Yeah, thanks. All right, cool.

02:51.144 --> 02:52.278
- I love you too.
- Bay.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.313
Could you move your car please?

02:54.348 --> 02:55.414
You're blocking me in.

02:55.449 --> 02:58.050
I parked where I always do.

02:58.085 --> 03:00.219
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna be late for work.

03:00.253 --> 03:02.321
Fine. I will be right there.

03:06.193 --> 03:09.061
I thought not living under
the same roof was gonna help,

03:09.096 --> 03:11.197
but things are as bad as
ever between the two of you.

03:11.231 --> 03:13.265
Well, maybe this is just how it's gonna be.

03:14.901 --> 03:17.903
The bass too?!

03:20.006 --> 03:22.041
I can't believe you're really doing it.

03:22.075 --> 03:24.009
Doing what.

03:24.044 --> 03:26.178
Getting all jobby and mature.

03:27.714 --> 03:28.781
Well, I'm getting married.

03:28.815 --> 03:29.982
The two kind of go hand in hand.

03:31.017 --> 03:32.051
Yeah, I guess they do.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.023
Did you lose your car keys?

04:11.057 --> 04:13.058
Or are you looking for
change for the meter?

04:13.093 --> 04:15.027
Neither.

04:15.061 --> 04:16.928
And do you mind not staring?

04:18.932 --> 04:20.966
You're drawing attention to this.

04:22.869 --> 04:25.671
I don't even know what this is.

04:25.705 --> 04:27.773
But this is the sign for "staring."

04:30.043 --> 04:32.044
Geo-caching.

04:32.078 --> 04:34.070
Geo-what?

04:34.075 --> 04:38.062
_

04:38.364 --> 04:42.100
Wow. You've gotten really good.

04:42.134 --> 04:43.468
Told you.

04:58.384 --> 05:01.219
What's geo-caching?

05:01.254 --> 05:03.989
If I can learn to sign,

05:04.023 --> 05:06.358
you can learn to Internet search.

05:15.101 --> 05:17.469
Because it's Toby and
Nikki's wedding, not mine.

05:17.503 --> 05:20.372
Mom. Mom, my battery's dying.

05:20.406 --> 05:22.173
Okay, uh, ca... bye.

05:25.021 --> 05:27.355
According to my mother,
Toby's getting married

05:27.390 --> 05:30.258
because I was too distracted with my book,

05:30.293 --> 05:33.261
and I'm not working hard enough to move

05:33.296 --> 05:36.264
the reception someplace "appropriate."

05:36.299 --> 05:38.934
Sweetie, your mother doesn't listen,

05:38.968 --> 05:41.269
and she makes everything your fault.

05:43.072 --> 05:44.940
Did you even hear a word I said?

05:46.142 --> 05:48.877
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to make sense of this bill.

05:48.911 --> 05:50.946
What is going on with your mother?

05:50.980 --> 05:53.014
Well, on the one hand,

05:53.049 --> 05:55.217
she can't believe that I'm
letting Toby get married

05:55.251 --> 05:56.952
before he even goes to college.

05:56.986 --> 05:59.254
And on the other, she wants
to micromanage his wedding

05:59.288 --> 06:01.857
and invite third-cousins
I've never even heard of

06:01.891 --> 06:03.925
even though I've told her no four times.

06:05.328 --> 06:07.229
Your mother never listens

06:07.263 --> 06:09.931
and she makes everything your fault.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.236
Try to tune her out.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.204
I gotta get to the office,

06:16.239 --> 06:18.273
see if my staff can
make sense of this thing.

06:21.043 --> 06:22.844
Have a nice day.

06:28.885 --> 06:30.151
What's so funny?

06:30.186 --> 06:34.055
Have you heard of this
blog? "The Kansas Squealer"?

06:34.090 --> 06:37.058
- No.
- The guy in the mailroom told me about it.

06:37.093 --> 06:39.261
And they've got all this dirt

06:39.295 --> 06:41.029
on everything that happens here

06:41.063 --> 06:42.864
and in the state government.

06:42.899 --> 06:45.066
I mean, it's pretty merciless.

06:45.101 --> 06:48.270
Hey, so have you ever
heard of geo-caching?

06:48.304 --> 06:51.039
Oh yeah, people in my youth group love it.

06:51.073 --> 06:52.274
I mean, it's supposed to be really fun.

06:52.308 --> 06:54.276
Okay, so you get a map

06:54.310 --> 06:56.111
or some coordinates

06:56.145 --> 06:58.313
and then you use the G.P.S. in your phone

06:58.347 --> 07:01.783
to find a box or container or something?

07:01.817 --> 07:04.152
Yeah, people hide cool
little presents in it

07:04.186 --> 07:05.987
and then you find it, take it

07:06.022 --> 07:08.089
and replace it with something of your own.

07:08.124 --> 07:10.125
Oh. That does sound kind of cool.

07:10.159 --> 07:12.160
You've got a strategy
session with Chip Coto

07:12.194 --> 07:14.129
then you have a radio interview at 4:15

07:14.163 --> 07:16.164
and a constituent meet and greet at 5:30.

07:16.198 --> 07:17.866
No rest for the weary, huh?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.167
Wait till you get your
committee assignment.

07:19.201 --> 07:21.069
Did you guys finish the bullet
points on that education bill?

07:21.038 --> 07:22.806
Yes, I made this cheat sheet

07:22.840 --> 07:24.774
and I put post-its by
the important amendments.

07:24.809 --> 07:25.909
Great. Thanks very much.

07:25.943 --> 07:28.945
Did you see in section 27b

07:28.980 --> 07:31.147
they're gonna stop funding for Sex Ed

07:31.182 --> 07:33.850
and require an abstinence-only education?

07:33.885 --> 07:35.151
Yeah, I think I saw that.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.821
So how can you support that?

07:37.855 --> 07:39.990
What's wrong with teenagers not having sex?

07:40.024 --> 07:41.925
I think it's really
important that kids know

07:41.959 --> 07:43.860
that abstinence is a valid option.

07:43.895 --> 07:46.029
- Yeah.
- But you don't actually believe

07:46.063 --> 07:48.999
telling teenagers not to have sex
means they're not gonna have it?

07:49.033 --> 07:51.067
I mean, if they don't
learn to protect themselves,

07:51.102 --> 07:53.637
they'll just end up pregnant
with a bunch of S.T.Ds.

07:53.671 --> 07:55.939
Look, we support the bill and
we have less than 10 minutes

07:55.973 --> 07:58.575
to get the Senator up to speed. So
Nikki, why don't you come with me

07:58.643 --> 07:59.743
and help me brief the
Senator in his office?

07:59.777 --> 08:01.912
Okay.

08:21.599 --> 08:22.632
Hey.

08:25.203 --> 08:26.167
__

08:27.538 --> 08:29.472
Don't worry. I'm not here

08:29.507 --> 08:33.710
to talk about guys or
even complain about Daphne.

08:33.744 --> 08:38.682
What do you think about Toby
and Nikki getting married?

08:38.716 --> 08:40.417
It's crazy, right?

08:41.385 --> 08:43.294
__

08:43.587 --> 08:47.324
Thank you. Why didn't
you say something earlier?

08:48.295 --> 08:50.109
__

08:52.290 --> 08:54.751
__

08:55.366 --> 08:58.335
I keep thinking my parents
are gonna find a way to stop it

08:58.369 --> 09:02.005
or Toby's gonna realize
that it's a giant mistake,

09:02.039 --> 09:04.074
but I really think that it's gonna happen.

09:04.075 --> 09:08.089
__

09:09.384 --> 09:15.601
__

09:18.289 --> 09:20.991
He's selling his amps

09:21.025 --> 09:22.892
and his guitars,

09:22.927 --> 09:24.294
to help pay for the wedding.

09:26.275 --> 09:30.078
__

09:31.179 --> 09:34.229
__

09:34.271 --> 09:38.141
Do you think that she's
making him give up playing?

09:38.142 --> 09:40.001
__

09:44.049 --> 09:46.002
__

09:46.017 --> 09:48.118
Yeah.

09:49.854 --> 09:50.987
I know.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.059
Thanks.

10:03.868 --> 10:04.968
Come in!

10:06.737 --> 10:09.506
Hey, Adrianna, I didn't know you were back.

10:09.540 --> 10:10.974
Well, the twins started
sleeping through the night,

10:11.008 --> 10:13.510
so they don't need me anymore.

10:13.544 --> 10:15.678
The parents might refer
me to a friend of theirs

10:15.713 --> 10:17.647
- who's due with triplets.
- Oh.

10:17.681 --> 10:19.682
Does anybody just have one kid anymore?

10:19.717 --> 10:21.484
I guess not.

10:21.519 --> 10:23.753
Well, at least you'll be able
to sleep through the night.

10:23.788 --> 10:27.690
Yeah. I hope you don't
mind if I wash a few things.

10:27.725 --> 10:29.826
- Of course not.
- Do you have any towels

10:29.860 --> 10:31.628
you might want to throw in with mine?

10:31.662 --> 10:34.431
I'll leave them folded
on the dryer for you.

10:34.465 --> 10:36.533
No no, I've already done them.

10:36.567 --> 10:39.502
- What are you doing there?
- Oh, it's my shopping list.

10:39.537 --> 10:41.538
- It's grocery day.
- Mmm.

10:41.572 --> 10:44.407
I could use a few things too. Mmm.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.577
Oh, you want to come with me?

10:47.611 --> 10:50.280
You sure you don't mind?

10:50.314 --> 10:51.581
No, not at all.

10:51.615 --> 10:53.616
Okay, I'll go get my coupon envelope.

10:53.651 --> 10:55.385
I have a lot of duplicates,

10:55.419 --> 10:56.653
so both of us can use them.

10:56.687 --> 10:58.421
Oh no, save 'em for yourself.

10:58.456 --> 11:00.090
Oh, no no, listen.

11:00.124 --> 11:03.460
You'd be surprised how much you can save.

11:03.494 --> 11:06.196
About four years ago... no, maybe five...

11:06.230 --> 11:10.233
anyway, we were having three other
families over for Thanksgiving.

11:10.267 --> 11:13.369
Regina and I clipped every
coupon we could find for months.

11:13.404 --> 11:17.107
We ended up with a cart
filled, spilling with food,

11:17.141 --> 11:20.977
and the bill came down to under $100.

11:21.011 --> 11:22.378
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

11:22.413 --> 11:24.114
So it's going to be fun.

11:26.117 --> 11:29.385
It's just really hard to help
when I totally disagree with him.

11:29.420 --> 11:33.056
Well, I mean, there's some pretty
big philosophical differences

11:33.090 --> 11:34.991
between us and the Kennishes.

11:35.025 --> 11:36.292
But he wouldn't even listen to me.

11:36.327 --> 11:38.895
Well, maybe once he settles in

11:38.929 --> 11:41.064
he'll be more open to new,

11:41.098 --> 11:43.133
or should I say, sane ideas.

11:45.169 --> 11:47.871
So when are you coming home?

11:47.905 --> 11:51.107
Soon. I just need to make
sure that I am really ready.

11:51.142 --> 11:54.944
It's just weird not seeing
you every morning and night.

11:54.979 --> 11:57.780
I know. I think once I have a job

11:57.815 --> 12:00.850
I will be able to handle
living with the Kennishes again.

12:00.885 --> 12:02.719
How's that going?

12:03.787 --> 12:04.954
Well...

12:04.989 --> 12:06.990
there aren't that many
design jobs in the city

12:07.024 --> 12:09.859
and I... I screwed up one of the best.

12:11.028 --> 12:13.830
Well, Whitney hired you once.

12:13.864 --> 12:14.931
Maybe she'll do it again.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.733
I doubt that.

12:17.935 --> 12:20.503
Can't you tell her about
rehab and everything?

12:20.538 --> 12:22.972
Honey... don't worry.

12:23.007 --> 12:25.642
I will find something.

12:25.676 --> 12:27.911
And when you do, you'll come home?

12:27.945 --> 12:30.547
Yeah. That's the plan.

12:32.516 --> 12:34.617
Oh.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.554
Sorry, I, um... I'm supposed
to meet my sponsor downtown

12:37.588 --> 12:41.391
and I should probably get
going in case there's traffic.

12:41.425 --> 12:43.560
Of course. Go.

12:43.594 --> 12:45.461
Yeah, bye.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.485
So, the next time he came through San Juan,

12:55.519 --> 12:58.288
I refused to see him. I said,

12:58.322 --> 13:00.190
"you want to go to your
cousin's wedding with someone?

13:00.224 --> 13:02.492
Why don't you ask Yolanda?" Just like that.

13:02.526 --> 13:04.561
Then my sister hangs up the phone for me,

13:04.595 --> 13:07.564
and it's "hallelujah,
we're free of that rat."

13:07.598 --> 13:11.101
But the next day, who
shows up at my office?

13:11.135 --> 13:13.136
- George.
- Yes.

13:14.438 --> 13:16.072
Where should I put this?

13:16.107 --> 13:17.407
Oh, just please leave it on the counter.

13:17.441 --> 13:21.278
The doctor was not interested
in any funny business,

13:21.312 --> 13:24.047
so I took George outside.

13:24.081 --> 13:25.448
And then he tells me...

13:25.483 --> 13:28.351
"You know who Yolanda is?

13:28.386 --> 13:31.054
Yolanda is my grandmother."

13:31.088 --> 13:33.089
Wow. That is some story.

13:33.157 --> 13:34.391
Uh-huh.

13:34.425 --> 13:36.159
You know what? I have to
return this call to my mom.

13:36.193 --> 13:38.228
You know, you should line these shelves,

13:38.262 --> 13:40.297
protect this beautiful wood.

13:40.331 --> 13:42.299
Well, I have some contact paper,

13:42.333 --> 13:44.301
- but I've never gotten around to it.
- I can do it.

13:44.335 --> 13:48.071
- No, that's okay.
- Oh, I have the time. I'm happy to help.

13:48.105 --> 13:49.839
Where's the paper?

13:49.874 --> 13:51.174
Uh...

13:53.144 --> 13:55.845
Wow, that's impressive.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.081
Yeah, another 10-year-old trend

13:58.115 --> 13:59.683
you're just now picking up on?

14:00.985 --> 14:04.688
So how come you couldn't just tell me that

14:04.722 --> 14:07.691
geo-caching was like a treasure hunt?

14:08.793 --> 14:10.093
Because it's more than that.

14:10.127 --> 14:11.995
It's like a secret club

14:12.029 --> 14:16.633
and if you can't find out what
geo-caching is for yourself,

14:16.667 --> 14:18.868
then you certainly can't do it.

14:19.870 --> 14:21.504
I can do it.

14:31.882 --> 14:34.617
I completely understand
and I'm terribly sorry.

14:36.487 --> 14:38.722
Hey.

14:38.756 --> 14:40.457
- Hey.
- Is everything okay?

14:41.859 --> 14:45.428
I don't feel like a human anymore.

14:45.463 --> 14:48.465
I'm just a robot who says,
"I'm sorry. I understand.

14:48.499 --> 14:50.400
I'm sorry," over and over again.

14:50.434 --> 14:52.435
Well, would a grilled cheese help?

14:52.470 --> 14:55.238
Oh yes, thank you. I'm starving.

14:55.272 --> 14:58.541
Hey, so we really need to
get that counseling session

14:58.576 --> 15:01.244
with Reverend Steve in the books.

15:01.278 --> 15:04.481
Oh right, sorry. My
mind has been elsewhere.

15:04.515 --> 15:07.450
Can we do it some night this week?

15:07.518 --> 15:10.353
Yeah, I can see what he has available,

15:10.388 --> 15:14.157
but we really have to keep
our appointment this time.

15:14.191 --> 15:17.293
We've already changed it twice.

15:17.328 --> 15:19.262
Well, it was kinda out of my hands.

15:19.296 --> 15:22.165
- I had stuff going on here.
- No, I... I know that.

15:22.199 --> 15:24.334
It just... it's important.

15:25.369 --> 15:26.970
I didn't say it wasn't.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.207
Oh God... I'm sorry.

15:31.242 --> 15:33.143
- I... I gotta go.
- Oh.

15:33.177 --> 15:34.411
- Thank you for the sandwich.
- Uh-huh.

15:37.114 --> 15:39.983
So I have a great idea for the Luau...

15:40.017 --> 15:41.985
a band, and I already have an in.

15:42.019 --> 15:43.253
- What's their name?
- Awesome Sauce.

15:43.287 --> 15:45.155
- Oh, I love them.
- You've heard of them?

15:45.189 --> 15:47.223
- No, I just love that name.
- I don't know.

15:47.258 --> 15:49.993
I'm flashing on bad
band experiences of yore.

15:50.027 --> 15:52.095
When they suck, it's like
you're spreading a sound virus.

15:52.129 --> 15:55.231
That's true. You can't unhear
a Nickelback cover band.

15:55.266 --> 15:58.802
Well, these guys are great. Trust me.

15:58.836 --> 16:00.904
- Can they play "Margaritaville"?
- God, I hope not.

16:00.938 --> 16:01.890
Oh, I think they sound fun.

16:02.556 --> 16:04.269
You know what people are doing
when they're watching a band?

16:04.275 --> 16:07.777
Watching a band. Not
playing games, riding rides

16:07.811 --> 16:10.179
- or doing other things that make the park money.
- Ooh, that's a good point.

16:10.214 --> 16:14.017
Well, these guys have a big following.

16:14.051 --> 16:16.719
They'll bring a ton of people to the park.

16:16.754 --> 16:19.923
Ka-ching! More concessions
and tickets sold.

16:19.957 --> 16:21.958
And they'll play for free.

16:24.094 --> 16:26.029
No foul language, family-friendly lyrics

16:26.063 --> 16:27.730
and they have to plug the concessions.

16:27.765 --> 16:29.732
- Deal.
- Okay.

16:50.955 --> 16:52.855
Sorry.

17:34.531 --> 17:37.233
- What is going on?
- A cockroach.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.302
- Are you sure?
- Yes, it was in the sink

17:39.336 --> 17:41.170
and now it disappeared somewhere.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.473
There! It's coming toward you.

17:43.507 --> 17:45.174
- No no no, stop.
- Get it! Step on it!

17:45.209 --> 17:46.242
- No! Stop! No!
- Get it!

17:46.216 --> 17:48.017
This is what happens when you leave

17:48.085 --> 17:49.052
the dishes out all night.

17:49.086 --> 17:50.186
Ooh, there it is.

17:52.423 --> 17:54.090
Ugh.

17:55.092 --> 17:57.026
Okay, for the record,

17:57.061 --> 18:00.029
this is not about dirty dishes.
Cockroaches like moisture,

18:00.064 --> 18:01.798
so you probably have a leak under there.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.266
Well, from now on...

18:03.300 --> 18:05.935
wash the dishes when you use them.

18:05.970 --> 18:07.804
I heard you.

18:07.838 --> 18:12.008
And can you please stop leaving your
shoes in the middle of the floor.

18:12.042 --> 18:14.043
I forgot what it was like living with you.

18:14.078 --> 18:16.946
It's a condo, not a museum display.

18:16.981 --> 18:19.749
I just don't like to live in squalor.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.017
I don't think that's too much to ask.

18:21.051 --> 18:22.986
A pair of shoes is not squalor.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.887
To me it is.

18:26.090 --> 18:27.790
Okay, I got it.

18:27.825 --> 18:29.626
Good.

18:44.982 --> 18:47.084
- Hello!
- Hey.

18:48.152 --> 18:49.186
Hey.

18:52.056 --> 18:56.059
The coast is clear. I do believe
Adrianna has already gone to bed.

18:59.831 --> 19:02.099
- I saved you some chili.
- Oh, bless you.

19:04.702 --> 19:07.737
- Tough day?
- Between the meetings and the constituents...

19:07.772 --> 19:09.005
on top of everything else,

19:09.040 --> 19:11.741
Daphne is now on me because of my politics.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.643
And you know what? Quite frankly,

19:13.678 --> 19:15.745
I don't have the energy to fight her too.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.915
Are you sure Adrianna's asleep?

19:18.950 --> 19:22.819
Yeah. So where are we on the
whole George-Adrianna saga?

19:22.854 --> 19:26.556
Last we left off, he
had said, "I love you,"

19:26.591 --> 19:28.892
and she still hadn't said it back.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.965
It's like the world's
most low-stakes telenovela.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.701
It seems like all I do is complain.

19:37.735 --> 19:40.470
Adrianna, my mother.

19:40.505 --> 19:44.474
You just need to tell 'em both to back off.

19:44.509 --> 19:46.543
Yeah, it's that easy.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.581
Hey.

19:51.616 --> 19:55.452
Guess who got Awesome Sauce a sweet gig.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.454
What? Where?

19:57.488 --> 19:59.523
The lovely Maui, Kansas Luau.

19:59.557 --> 20:01.525
And we can play our own stuff?

20:01.559 --> 20:03.493
As long as you find a
way to plug the corndogs,

20:03.528 --> 20:05.362
you're good.

20:05.396 --> 20:08.298
- When is it?
- Friday around sunset.

20:08.366 --> 20:10.634
Oh, we have our counseling session Friday.

20:10.668 --> 20:14.471
- Can't we reschedule it?
- We can't keep canceling.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.473
- It's gonna seem like we don't care.
- No, it's gonna seem

20:16.507 --> 20:18.375
like we have other things going on.

20:18.409 --> 20:21.144
- What time's the session?
- 7:30.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.114
Well, if you push it to 8:00,
then you can probably do both.

20:24.148 --> 20:26.183
Come on, you guys
haven't played in forever.

20:26.217 --> 20:29.519
I'm sure Reverend Steve will understand.

20:29.554 --> 20:32.222
Yeah, 'cause that's
what reverends do, right?

20:32.256 --> 20:34.024
Understand stuff?

20:37.061 --> 20:39.996
I'll talk to him, see what I can do.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.132
It's gonna be great.

20:47.171 --> 20:48.905
Look what I found.

20:48.940 --> 20:51.208
Somebody went geo-caching.

20:51.242 --> 20:53.243
It was in a fake pine-cone.

20:53.277 --> 20:54.978
What did you leave?

20:55.012 --> 20:56.046
A quarter.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.149
That's not very good, huh?

20:59.183 --> 21:01.184
All it says is that the person who left it

21:01.219 --> 21:03.753
doesn't frequent laundromats.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.124
So tomorrow I'm gonna do

21:08.159 --> 21:10.660
the Shoal Creek multi-cache.

21:10.695 --> 21:13.830
It sounds like no one's
ever found the fifth cache.

21:13.864 --> 21:14.798
Do you wanna come?

21:16.067 --> 21:20.637
I'm taking a break from
relationships this summer.

21:20.671 --> 21:24.574
I asked you to geo-cache
with me, not elope.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.911
I'll meet you at the park entrance at 7:00.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.688
Ooh! What's this?

21:38.723 --> 21:40.824
Tropical paradise in ice form.

21:40.858 --> 21:43.727
Behold bahama mama and bubble gum.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.630
Mmm.

21:47.665 --> 21:49.633
I think I like Maui, Kansas.

21:51.402 --> 21:54.371
- So you having fun, honey?
- Well, I spend most of my day

21:54.405 --> 21:57.574
trying to convince people to
play a game called loco nuts,

21:57.608 --> 21:59.542
but yeah, I am.

21:59.577 --> 22:02.279
Plus I got Toby and his band a gig here.

22:02.313 --> 22:04.314
I know. I'm surprised he can do it.

22:04.348 --> 22:06.616
He's been so busy with the
car wash and his wedding.

22:06.651 --> 22:08.451
Yeah, I know.

22:09.787 --> 22:14.524
So... how are you and dad feeling
about the whole wedding thing?

22:14.558 --> 22:16.559
Well, we're getting used to it.

22:16.594 --> 22:20.363
- You are?
- Well, we're working on it.

22:20.398 --> 22:23.166
Instead of working on it,

22:23.200 --> 22:25.568
why aren't you trying to stop it?

22:25.603 --> 22:29.205
If we could make you two kids
do what we wanted you to do,

22:29.240 --> 22:30.407
you'd be sleeping at home tonight

22:30.441 --> 22:33.343
and you wouldn't be
wearing shorts with tights.

22:33.377 --> 22:36.012
Isn't there something that you can do?

22:36.047 --> 22:38.281
Between you and grandma Bonnie,

22:38.316 --> 22:40.250
somehow this wedding is all my fault.

22:40.284 --> 22:42.018
No, that's not what I meant.

22:42.053 --> 22:46.323
Honey, if we ask Toby to
choose between us and Nikki,

22:47.358 --> 22:48.325
he'll choose her.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.061
That's not true.

22:52.096 --> 22:53.930
I don't wanna take that chance.

22:53.964 --> 22:55.932
Do you?

22:59.762 --> 23:01.938
I mean, you know what?
We can certainly explore

23:01.972 --> 23:05.775
a deeper blue, but that's gonna
darken the space by quite a bit.

23:05.810 --> 23:08.011
I'll be with you.

23:08.045 --> 23:10.880
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna
messenger you some samples, okay?

23:10.915 --> 23:13.883
All right. You got it. Thanks.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.754
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

23:17.788 --> 23:19.989
- You seem really busy.
- It's a blessing and a curse.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.992
Craig, could you... and he's on the phone.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.062
Okay, can I help you with something?

23:26.097 --> 23:28.031
We met before, actually.

23:28.065 --> 23:29.933
You hired my mom, Regina.

23:30.968 --> 23:33.036
Yes, I remember.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.838
What can I do for you?

23:34.872 --> 23:36.806
Well, I just wanted to let you know

23:36.841 --> 23:40.877
that my mom went to
rehab and she's sober now.

23:40.911 --> 23:44.514
She's a really hard worker.
She's got a great eye.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.949
Mmm, she's got great taste.
That's why I hired her.

23:45.983 --> 23:49.786
Well, you seem like maybe
you could use some help.

23:49.820 --> 23:52.789
And maybe you could hire her again.

23:52.823 --> 23:56.393
I am very happy that she's doing better,

23:56.427 --> 23:58.328
I just don't think it's a good fit.

23:58.362 --> 24:00.397
Can't you give her a second chance?

24:01.665 --> 24:03.466
I'm sorry.

24:03.501 --> 24:06.336
- Not this one. It's this one.
- Great.

24:10.747 --> 24:12.848
It's not a matter of money, mom.

24:12.882 --> 24:15.651
It's space. We can't
crowd out Nikki's family...

24:15.685 --> 24:18.921
To make room for your
friends who I don't even know.

24:18.955 --> 24:22.591
Yeah, ma, hold on.

24:22.625 --> 24:23.792
- Adrianna.
- Huh?

24:23.827 --> 24:27.563
- Have you seen my laptop?
- Uh, I put it over here.

24:27.597 --> 24:29.865
It was right here before.

24:29.899 --> 24:34.403
- Uhh...
- Mom, can I call you back in one minute?

24:35.672 --> 24:38.540
Oh, all right. I'll call
you back after your lunch.

24:38.575 --> 24:41.376
- F... fine.
- Found it.

24:43.446 --> 24:44.613
Thanks.

24:48.551 --> 24:50.452
I saw you have some nice avocados.

24:50.487 --> 24:51.687
Why don't I make us a salad, huh?

24:51.721 --> 24:55.491
You know, I just need some space.

24:58.228 --> 24:59.194
Of course.

25:01.397 --> 25:03.532
I... I just like to cook.

25:03.566 --> 25:05.300
It helps me think.

25:05.335 --> 25:08.270
I understand. I'll clean up later.

25:20.517 --> 25:23.452
Okay, the hula girls are
seriously almost done.

25:23.486 --> 25:25.320
We were supposed to go on half hour ago.

25:25.355 --> 25:27.022
I'm sorry. Apparently,

25:27.056 --> 25:30.058
their hands and their hips
have multiple stories to tell.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.060
- This was a bad idea.
- It's fine.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.163
We were supposed to go on at 7:00.
They're just a little backed up.

25:34.197 --> 25:36.331
- We're still gonna make it.
- Toby, when was the last time

25:36.366 --> 25:39.001
you heard of a band going on
when they were supposed to?

25:39.035 --> 25:40.369
Just relax, okay?

25:40.403 --> 25:42.871
We need to go now.

25:44.941 --> 25:46.208
You can't just bail.

25:46.242 --> 25:49.011
We also can't just bail on Reverend Steve.

25:50.035 --> 25:52.923
__

25:52.982 --> 25:55.717
Emmett thinks we should stay as well.

25:59.055 --> 26:00.155
See? They're done,

26:00.190 --> 26:03.892
- so it is all you guys.
- Perfect timing.

26:03.927 --> 26:05.694
Let's go.

26:08.097 --> 26:09.998
- What's up, Maui?
- Thank you!

26:12.669 --> 26:15.838
And look, this one says that they
don't require a college degree,

26:15.872 --> 26:17.840
just imagination and flair,

26:17.874 --> 26:19.675
both of which you have.

26:19.709 --> 26:20.976
I talked to them yesterday.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.744
They filled the position last month

26:22.779 --> 26:24.580
but just forgot to take the listing down.

26:25.682 --> 26:28.016
- Oh.
- It's tough out there.

26:28.051 --> 26:29.852
I've called every design firm,

26:29.886 --> 26:32.554
fabric store and
furniture shop in the city.

26:32.589 --> 26:36.692
I'm actually thinking
about going to see Whitney.

26:38.628 --> 26:42.497
Oh, um, you probably shouldn't bother.

26:42.532 --> 26:43.932
What? You were the one
who said she hired me once,

26:43.967 --> 26:46.602
maybe she'd be willing to hire me again.

26:46.636 --> 26:48.570
Well...

26:48.605 --> 26:52.407
I already checked with her.
They don't have any openings.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.543
You talked to Whitney?

26:54.577 --> 26:57.579
Yeah, I knew how hard it
would be for you to face her,

26:57.614 --> 26:59.848
- so I just thought...
- Daphne.

26:59.883 --> 27:03.385
How could you do that? It's humiliating.

27:03.419 --> 27:04.753
I was just trying to help.

27:04.787 --> 27:07.522
You've just made it that much
harder for me to go see her.

27:07.557 --> 27:09.758
If I had wanted your help,
I would've asked for it.

27:11.561 --> 27:12.794
Okay, you know what? Fine.

27:12.829 --> 27:15.664
You wanna live here
forever, then go right ahead.

27:15.698 --> 27:17.633
You know that's not what I want.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.569
Are you sure? Because you
seem really comfortable here.

27:20.603 --> 27:23.605
- I just need some...
- I know, I know, you need space.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.774
But what I don't understand is how exactly

27:25.808 --> 27:30.345
does Bay sleeping on
the couch give you space?

27:30.380 --> 27:33.615
- I invited you to come.
- That's not the point!

27:33.650 --> 27:36.385
How can you live with her and not with me?

27:37.453 --> 27:39.688
It's... different.

27:39.722 --> 27:41.657
How is it different?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.327
I guess...

27:46.696 --> 27:47.629
it's...

27:49.299 --> 27:51.199
easier with Bay.

27:52.268 --> 27:53.635
I haven't disappointed her

27:53.670 --> 27:55.637
the way that I have disappointed you.

27:55.672 --> 27:57.606
Not yet.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.411
Okay, I get it.

28:03.513 --> 28:05.180
I'll talk to you later.

28:17.160 --> 28:22.197

28:25.101 --> 28:29.338

28:48.291 --> 28:50.025
Toby, we really got to go.

28:50.059 --> 28:51.293
We're already half an hour late.

28:51.327 --> 28:54.196
But we gotta do an encore. I mean...

28:58.034 --> 29:00.035
Uh, just... everybody, hold on

29:00.069 --> 29:02.004
just one second, all
right? We'll be right back.

29:03.973 --> 29:06.241
Toby, please do not make me the bad guy.

29:06.275 --> 29:08.310
How am I making you the bad guy?

29:08.344 --> 29:11.113
I'm like dragging you to do this with me.

29:11.147 --> 29:13.115
I want you to want to do this.

29:13.149 --> 29:14.816
I do. I just...

29:14.851 --> 29:17.185
don't you want to keep playing?

29:17.220 --> 29:20.155
We started this band together. I mean...

29:20.189 --> 29:23.825
- You're not into it anymore?
- Of course I am,

29:23.860 --> 29:25.227
but that's not the point.

29:25.261 --> 29:27.095
Well, then what's the point?

29:27.130 --> 29:29.197
You don't respect my faith.

29:29.232 --> 29:30.999
What?

29:32.235 --> 29:34.002
I thought we were past this.

29:34.037 --> 29:37.005
Well, I thought so too, but
you're not taking it seriously.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.740
I am, I just don't think that...

29:38.775 --> 29:40.942
Church should trump everything.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.878
Church doesn't trump everything,

29:42.912 --> 29:45.047
but it's pretty high on
my list and you know that.

29:45.081 --> 29:45.848
Yeah, I do.

29:45.849 --> 29:48.619
And I also know that this is
the most fun I've had in months.

29:49.052 --> 29:50.986
Awesome Sauce!

29:51.020 --> 29:54.022

30:00.063 --> 30:03.799

Well, guys, we've got one more for ya.

30:16.813 --> 30:18.880
Whoo!

30:18.915 --> 30:22.784
This is kind of a white
stripesy kind of number.

30:56.377 --> 30:57.444
Hi.

30:59.647 --> 31:01.748
I've been sitting in my car for an hour,

31:01.783 --> 31:03.383
working up the nerve to come in here.

31:04.652 --> 31:06.486
I wanted to tell you

31:06.521 --> 31:09.489
I did not put my daughter
up to coming here.

31:09.524 --> 31:12.292
I didn't think you did.

31:12.327 --> 31:13.393
She's a good kid.

31:13.428 --> 31:15.262
She is.

31:15.296 --> 31:17.731
I wish I could put her
at the top of my résumé.

31:19.300 --> 31:22.269
And, um, she probably said

31:22.303 --> 31:24.404
what I'm about to say, which is...

31:26.374 --> 31:28.709
you took a chance on me and I let you down.

31:29.744 --> 31:31.278
I'm sorry.

31:31.312 --> 31:32.512
Thank you.

31:33.548 --> 31:35.449
And I know that wasn't easy to say.

31:36.651 --> 31:39.419
I'm still waiting for my
sister to make her amends.

31:41.422 --> 31:43.457
So...

31:43.491 --> 31:46.560
how did the Mulkowsky living room turn out

31:46.594 --> 31:48.528
with the Danish theme?

31:48.563 --> 31:50.130
Yeah, it looked really beautiful.

31:50.164 --> 31:52.099
We got quite a few referrals from it too.

31:53.301 --> 31:54.568
So...

31:56.137 --> 31:57.137
do you need a hand?

32:00.308 --> 32:02.442
I am very happy that you got help,

32:02.477 --> 32:04.378
and you're really talented.

32:04.412 --> 32:08.081
It's just that I have got so
much going on here right now,

32:08.116 --> 32:10.284
- I can't risk having...
- I am sober now.

32:10.318 --> 32:12.119
Completely.

32:12.153 --> 32:15.322
And I know that I could make
your life a hell of a lot easier.

32:15.356 --> 32:19.026
Please. I'll work for free.

32:20.094 --> 32:21.161
Just give me a month

32:21.195 --> 32:23.964
and I will prove to you how valuable I am.

32:29.437 --> 32:31.371
Two weeks.

32:31.406 --> 32:34.308
Really?

32:35.343 --> 32:36.343
Thank you so much.

32:36.377 --> 32:39.046
I promise you will not regret this.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.314
All right, you start on Monday.

32:40.348 --> 32:42.015
Thank you.

32:42.050 --> 32:44.184
Um, okay.

32:44.218 --> 32:45.886
I'm gonna go now.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.255
- Okay.
- Thanks.

32:51.326 --> 32:53.226
It's gotta be here.

32:53.261 --> 32:55.262
Let's look over there.

32:55.296 --> 32:58.065
Sometimes the most obvious
place is the most overlooked.

33:00.902 --> 33:02.836
Is my signing really good?

33:04.939 --> 33:07.841
Yeah. It's amazing.

33:07.875 --> 33:09.776
Thank you.

33:09.811 --> 33:12.879
I've begun translating everything I hear,

33:12.914 --> 33:15.182
like songs, the news...

33:15.216 --> 33:16.883
So here's the thing...

33:16.918 --> 33:19.052
we can either talk or search.

33:19.087 --> 33:22.055
But I can't really do both
very well in this light,

33:22.090 --> 33:24.791
so if we could do a little less talking,

33:24.826 --> 33:26.193
a lot more looking, that would be great.

33:26.227 --> 33:30.831
Wow. Inside that Anne of Green
Gables is a little tyrant.

33:30.865 --> 33:33.734
I'm sure you just said
something really snide,

33:33.768 --> 33:36.002
but I'm not gonna stop
my search to see what.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.945
Hey, thanks for playing tonight.

33:44.979 --> 33:46.713
You guys sounded great.

33:46.748 --> 33:48.582
No, we didn't.

33:48.616 --> 33:51.752
We were fighting and
completely out of sync.

33:53.654 --> 33:55.722
So why is Nikki so anti you guys playing?

33:55.757 --> 33:58.925
She's not. She just has other priorities.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.994
Doesn't she get how
important this is to you?

34:01.028 --> 34:03.530
You know, I don't really
wanna talk about it right now.

34:03.564 --> 34:05.766
Toby, you're not going to college.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.601
Now you're barely playing music.

34:07.635 --> 34:09.002
Are you sure it's worth it?

34:09.036 --> 34:11.670
Just... stop.

34:11.706 --> 34:14.507
She's sweet and everything,
but she's also...

34:14.542 --> 34:17.777
This is between me and Nikki.

34:17.812 --> 34:20.781
So now I'm not supposed to say anything,

34:20.815 --> 34:22.681
no matter what I'm feeling?

34:22.717 --> 34:23.850
Right.

34:23.885 --> 34:26.887
Come on, Toby. We tell
each other everything.

34:29.489 --> 34:30.590
Not anymore.

34:37.532 --> 34:38.899
This is ridiculous.

34:38.933 --> 34:40.801
It's gotta be here somewhere.

34:40.835 --> 34:43.670
Well, they do sometimes
upload incorrect coordinates.

34:43.704 --> 34:45.539
Wait, I think I see something.

34:47.375 --> 34:49.509
No, nothing.

34:49.543 --> 34:51.511
Damn it!

34:51.545 --> 34:52.813
We can retrace the quadrant.

34:52.847 --> 34:55.348
We've already done that.

34:55.382 --> 34:58.718
You seem a little overly-invested in this.

35:06.461 --> 35:07.661
It just doesn't make sense.

35:07.695 --> 35:10.564
She's gone for six weeks at rehab

35:10.598 --> 35:13.600
- and as soon as she comes back, she's gone again.
- Wait wait, who's she?

35:13.634 --> 35:16.336
And somehow it's okay to live with Bay,

35:16.370 --> 35:17.771
but the idea of living with me is gonna

35:17.805 --> 35:21.374
drive her to drink again or something.

35:21.409 --> 35:24.377
I don't know! And John
won't even listen to me

35:24.412 --> 35:27.414
and I only am doing this because I
thought I could make a difference!

35:27.482 --> 35:30.417
And it's summer and I'm not having any fun!

35:30.451 --> 35:33.386
- And I sound crazy.
- No.

36:01.315 --> 36:03.250
Must be the shirt.

36:03.284 --> 36:06.319
That's the third time
that's happened to me today.

36:08.256 --> 36:09.556
I'm joking.

36:13.094 --> 36:14.427
I... I have to go.

36:37.045 --> 36:38.945
How'd it go?

36:42.817 --> 36:45.786
I told him you were sick.

36:46.854 --> 36:48.588
He hopes you feel better.

36:57.765 --> 37:01.601
- Everybody loved the encore.
- That's great.

37:08.843 --> 37:11.545
Come in!

37:14.649 --> 37:15.816
Hello.

37:15.850 --> 37:17.718
I am sorry to bother you

37:18.853 --> 37:21.521
Oh! You could've done that at the house.

37:21.556 --> 37:22.956
It's okay.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.792
I feel terrible for snapping at you.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.862
I just... I wanted to apologize.

37:29.931 --> 37:32.666
I could tell that I was driving you crazy.

37:32.700 --> 37:36.670
It's just hard sometimes
not feeling useful.

37:36.704 --> 37:39.873
It was just... nice to have a purpose

37:39.907 --> 37:42.776
someone to talk to. I'm sorry.

37:43.878 --> 37:45.512
- Is this basil?
- Adria...

37:45.546 --> 37:48.515
Umm, yeah.

37:49.717 --> 37:52.486
I love having it in the
kitchen, but I usually kill it.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.422
Basil likes to be dry.

37:55.456 --> 37:57.424
Can I get you some iced tea?

37:57.458 --> 37:59.526
Oh, that's okay. I've gotta
go over the wedding plans

37:59.560 --> 38:00.694
with my mother one more time.

38:00.728 --> 38:03.563
Sounds like she's making
it really hard on you.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.733
Yeah.

38:09.570 --> 38:12.506
Maybe she's right about something.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.807
About what?

38:13.841 --> 38:17.411
She thinks Toby's grabbing
something to hold onto,

38:17.445 --> 38:19.546
because I was so busy with the book

38:19.580 --> 38:21.715
and we don't give him enough structure.

38:21.749 --> 38:24.518
And she's right. I've been preoccupied

38:24.552 --> 38:26.653
and I didn't want John to push too hard.

38:26.687 --> 38:29.456
Kathryn, if there's one thing I know,

38:29.490 --> 38:30.724
watching this family,

38:30.758 --> 38:33.527
you and John are wonderful parents.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.663
- Thanks.
- You know,

38:36.697 --> 38:39.766
their lives are never going to
look the way we want them to look.

38:41.669 --> 38:44.438
And maybe he's going to be okay.

38:48.609 --> 38:49.776
You know...

38:51.512 --> 38:53.447
I wanna start an herb garden.

38:53.481 --> 38:56.550
Hmm. Well, you need a container.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.352
Get one of those pretty window boxes.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.689
I have this old copper tub outside.

39:02.723 --> 39:03.757
Even better.

39:04.792 --> 39:06.526
Would you help me?

39:06.561 --> 39:08.562
I would love to.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.564
Thanks.

39:18.840 --> 39:19.840
Hey.

39:22.410 --> 39:23.577
I made pasta.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.450
- You all right?
- I don't really wanna talk about it.

39:30.485 --> 39:32.486
Let me fix you a bowl.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.688
I'm not really hungry.

39:34.722 --> 39:36.541
- What happened?
- Nothing.

39:36.545 --> 39:39.793
Bay. Bay.

39:44.832 --> 39:46.800
- I got the job.
- Great.

39:46.778 --> 39:49.380
That's great.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.584
What's going on? Where's Bay?

39:53.618 --> 39:55.586
She just got home. She won't talk to me.

39:55.620 --> 39:56.821
She stormed into your room.

39:56.855 --> 39:59.723
- Oh.
- What?

39:59.758 --> 40:02.426
She's a teenager.

40:02.461 --> 40:04.628
So we're supposed to let her be rude to us?

40:04.663 --> 40:09.467
No, we wait till the drama,
hormones or whatever it is dies down.

40:09.501 --> 40:13.370
- She just slammed that door.
- They're not always polite.

40:13.405 --> 40:16.774
I mean, this is not how
it was supposed to be.

40:16.808 --> 40:19.410
For us.

40:19.444 --> 40:20.644
Meaning?

40:20.679 --> 40:22.813
The three of us finally
under the same roof.

40:24.516 --> 40:26.383
This is our chance to finally have

40:26.418 --> 40:27.818
the life we were supposed to have.

40:27.853 --> 40:31.522
Angelo, this is what it would've been...

40:31.556 --> 40:34.792
dirty dishes, cockroaches and sullen teens.

40:34.826 --> 40:37.394
This is real life.

40:39.531 --> 40:40.798
I guess it is.

40:42.514 --> 40:43.681
Yeah, it's a Marshall.

40:43.715 --> 40:47.251
It's about two years old.
It's worth at least 700.

40:47.285 --> 40:51.555
Well, I could talk about
five. Are you in the K.C. area?

40:51.590 --> 40:53.391
Okay.

40:57.262 --> 40:58.462
Hey.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.331
What's up?

41:07.305 --> 41:09.273
I miss Toby.

41:10.308 --> 41:11.675
I think he's in his studio.

41:13.645 --> 41:14.712
I know.

41:17.349 --> 41:18.682
Yeah.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.725
I know that I've been kinda...

41:27.759 --> 41:29.427
It's okay.

41:33.665 --> 41:37.535
I've just been kind of jealous
of you getting closer to my mom.

41:39.504 --> 41:41.338
Welcome to my world.

41:45.577 --> 41:48.279
And...

41:48.313 --> 41:52.349
I... should've stuck up for you at Carlton.

41:56.321 --> 41:57.521
Thanks.

42:03.295 --> 42:05.329
I kissed the coffee guy, Jace.

42:05.363 --> 42:07.398
What? The British one?

42:07.432 --> 42:11.569
- He's British?
- Yeah, very.

42:11.603 --> 42:15.573
Oh! So that explains
why he puckers his lips

42:15.607 --> 42:17.675
when he says a word with the letter "O".

42:17.709 --> 42:20.611
Wait wait wait. So is he a good kisser?

42:20.645 --> 42:23.447
Yeah, he's pretty good.
