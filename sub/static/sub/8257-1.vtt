00:25.000 --> 00:27.600
I remember the first war.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.800
The way the sky burned.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.720
The faces of angels
destroyed.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.120
I saw a third of
Heaven's legion banished...

00:43.160 --> 00:45.680
and the creation of Hell.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.600
I stood with my brothers
and watched Lucifer fall.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.560
But now my brothers
are not brothers.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.400
And we have come here,
where we are mortal,

01:02.480 --> 01:05.960
to steal a dark soul
not yet Lucifer's...

01:06.040 --> 01:07.880
to serve our cause.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.920
I have always obeyed.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.840
But I never thought
the war...

01:18.400 --> 01:20.760
would happen again.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.120
Come to our help,
Lord, Holy Father,

02:34.200 --> 02:36.360
almighty
and eternal God.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.240
You are the source of every honor
and dignity,

02:39.320 --> 02:41.640
of all progress
and stability.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.320
You watch over the growing family of man
by Your gift of wisdom...

02:45.400 --> 02:47.360
and Your pattern of order.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.480
When You had appointed high priests
to rule Your people,

02:50.560 --> 02:53.880
You chose other men next to them
in rank and dignity...

02:53.920 --> 02:56.760
to be with them and to
help them in their task.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.640
And so there grew up
the ranks of priests...

02:59.680 --> 03:04.000
and the offices of Levites
established by sacred rites.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.880
In the desert You extended
the spirit of Moses to 70 wise men...

03:07.960 --> 03:11.160
who helped him to rule
the great company of his people.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.640
He shared among the sons of Aaron
the fullness of their father's power,

03:15.720 --> 03:19.000
to provide worthy priests
in sufficient number...

03:19.720 --> 03:22.240
for the increasing rites
of sacrifice and worship.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.680
With the same loving care You gave
companions to Your Son's apostles...

03:26.760 --> 03:29.080
to help in teaching
the faith,

03:29.160 --> 03:32.880
they preached the Gospel
to the whole world.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.600
Let Joseph, who is
to be ordained priest,

03:40.680 --> 03:42.520
come forward.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.360
Lord, I am not worthy to receive You,
but say the word and I shall be healed.

04:03.720 --> 04:08.760
Almighty Father, grant to this servant
of Yours the dignity of the priesthood.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.640
Renew within him
the spirit of holiness...

04:11.720 --> 04:15.120
as a coworker with
the Order of Bishops.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.320
We ask this through
our Lord Jesus Christ.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.760
One God,
forever and ever.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.680
Amen.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.400
Let Thomas, who is
to be ordained priest, come forward.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.200
Some people lose their faith
because Heaven shows them too little.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.040
But how many people lose their faith
because Heaven shows them too much?

05:52.640 --> 05:55.960
Years later, of all the gospels
I learned in seminary school,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.840
a verse from St. Paul
stays with me.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.680
It is perhaps the strangest passage
in the Bible, in which he writes:

06:02.720 --> 06:06.160
"Even now in Heaven there were angels
carrying savage weapons."

06:18.800 --> 06:21.600
Hey, you're not
supposed to be up here.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.800
Sorry.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.360
Don't fuckin' move.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.240
You don't need a gun,
Thomas.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.480
Who are you?

06:55.560 --> 06:58.760
Everything used to be
much simpler, didn't it?

06:58.840 --> 07:00.920
Get down, slow.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.680
- Everyone thinks they know
what Heaven is like.
- Turn around. Turn around!

07:04.760 --> 07:07.320
- Heaven isn't Heaven anymore.
- Now, take it easy.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.960
- Thomas... Thomas!
- Calm down. Take it easy.
- Will you listen?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.200
I was in the church
that day.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.120
I know what you saw.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.720
I know why you left
your faith on that floor.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.680
What do you want?

07:24.160 --> 07:27.880
You have no idea
what this is like for me.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.320
"A Thesis on Angels
in Religious Scripture"...

07:37.400 --> 07:39.600
by Thomas Dagget.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.520
Do you still believe...

07:42.560 --> 07:44.440
any of it?

07:44.480 --> 07:48.440
- You're asking me as a cop?
- As a priest.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.480
But I'm not a priest.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.600
St. Christopher.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.480
"Go your way in safety."

08:08.800 --> 08:10.840
Do you believe...

08:10.920 --> 08:13.400
that you're part
of God's plan,

08:13.480 --> 08:15.120
Thomas?

08:16.440 --> 08:18.360
That's a complicated question.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.240
No, it isn't.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.520
You found it, haven't you?

10:05.600 --> 10:08.280
You can't keep it from us,
Simon!
11:20,901
That's it. Go ahead.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.720
All right.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.120
Why don't you
call it in?

11:12.200 --> 11:15.960
Well, look at this. Tommy Dagget
actually lit by the light of morning.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.600
What am I doin' here, Burrows? I work
nights. It's not even my division.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.520
Well, we'll get to that.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.880
- Our friend here did a half-gainer
from the fourth floor.
- Jumper?

11:24.920 --> 11:28.240
Not unless he decided not to bother
opening the window first.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.280
81, clear. Unit 14, clear.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.000
Was he fucked up
or what?

11:35.080 --> 11:39.480
Well, he wasn't exactly in condition
to walk a chalk line when we got here.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.160
You're welcome to smell his breath,
if you like.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.560
He is missing
one or two things, though.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.160
- What's that?
- His eyes.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.400
Maybe they're stuck
in the radiator grill.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.560
Who's the room
registered under?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.960
- John Smith.
- Anything interesting inside?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.840
Well, there are what an experienced
detective like yourself...

11:58.920 --> 12:01.800
could possibly construe
as signs of a struggle.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.280
Of course, nobody saw
or heard anything.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.600
- Place been dusted?
- Yeah. Nothing.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.600
Kinda weird, huh,
somebody carrying that around?

12:31.640 --> 12:34.960
That's why Lieutenant Deason
had me call you down on this.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.360
Any ideas
what it's doin' here?

12:38.880 --> 12:40.760
No.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.800
"For it was there
at Nicene...

12:43.880 --> 12:45.720
that the world's
fourth-century bishops...

12:45.800 --> 12:49.560
declared that with the sacrifice
of God's Son man became one with God,

12:49.640 --> 12:52.440
for the first time
lifted above all other creations...

12:52.520 --> 12:54.360
to stand at His side
in Heaven."

12:54.440 --> 12:57.800
You been holdin' out on me.
I never knew you could read and write.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.920
That measures eight feet.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.280
- Where's Chimney Rock?
- Okay, let's move.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.200
Arizona.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.880
It's where I'll be
in two years and three months.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.760
You gonna give all this up?

13:11.840 --> 13:15.600
You're breakin' my heart.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.840
Don't forget
to tip the maid.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.360
# Amen #

15:45.440 --> 15:51.560
# Amen ##

16:26.200 --> 16:30.760
Hey, what's the big idea
of sitting out here all alone?

16:32.840 --> 16:35.160
Someone's here.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.520
Where?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.920
Pig out
on all the cake?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.680
No.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.000
But there, there might be one teeny,
tiny little piece left.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.760
But you'll have to
race me for it.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.840
- What's that?
- Where?

16:55.040 --> 16:56.880
Oh, you sneak!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.840
Tommy. A little early
for you, isn't it?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.600
Joseph.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.520
- They got you workin' days?
- Yeah.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.400
Huh.
Tyson, slow down.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.280
- Everybody's dead.
- Do you got any more of this?

18:25.360 --> 18:27.120
No.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.520
All right, where
do you wanna start?

18:29.600 --> 18:32.520
Well, I think we could
skip the cause of death.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.920
Why don't we begin
with his eyes?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.840
Your man has none.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.240
What, they weren't
in the radiator grill?

18:39.320 --> 18:41.640
No, I mean,
he never had any.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.040
No optical fibers,
no muscle pores, zip.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.920
We did a toxicology
on his blood, you know,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.200
- looking for the usual...
coke, booze, sugar.
- What'd you come up with?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.200
High sodium,
elevated erythrocytes,

18:52.280 --> 18:54.640
no floating cholesterol platelets,
trace of ammonia.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.360
- What's so unusual about that?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.280
Actually,
it's pretty common...

18:59.320 --> 19:01.200
for an aborted fetus.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.440
- Fetus?
- We also did a bone section.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.320
It wasn't much trouble; most of them
were sticking out of his chest anyway.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.040
Okay. And?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.440
When a baby grows,
their bones get larger...

19:10.520 --> 19:14.280
by having calcium layers form over the
haversian canals. Are you with me?

19:14.360 --> 19:17.520
- I'm with you.
- This leaves growth rings;
everybody's got 'em.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.400
Except our pal here.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.880
Oh.
And this is for you.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.280
He's also a hermaphrodite.
Ohh!

19:24.360 --> 19:27.720
He's got both male
and female sex organs.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.640
- Think of the possibilities.
- Yeah.

19:29.720 --> 19:34.320
He could be impotent and frigid at
the same time. They don't normally work.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.200
We found this
in the lining of his coat.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.280
- It's an old Bible.
- Yeah.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.160
Handwritten.
Beautiful, really.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.640
See this symbol?
Matches a scar on his neck.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.680
Exactly the same.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.920
That's attractive, huh?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.440
Anything else?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.800
There's a velvet
book marker.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.320
- Cute.
- What is it?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.520
Twenty-third chapter of
St. John's Revelations.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.400
And?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.320
There is no
23rd chapter.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.400
Well, maybe this is
the teacher's edition.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.520
- Can I keep this?
- Sign for it.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.560
What are we gonna do here,
Tommy?

20:20.640 --> 20:24.400
Do me a favor... just sit on it for a
couple of days, give me a head start...

20:24.480 --> 20:26.600
before the wolves
start circling, okay?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.520
Take your time.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.720
"And there were angels
who could not accept...

20:59.800 --> 21:02.120
the lifting of man
above them,

21:02.200 --> 21:07.120
and, like Lucifer, rebelled
against the armies of the
loyal archangel Michael.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.960
And there rose
a second war in Heaven."

21:41.960 --> 21:46.000
"Lieutenant to the seraph
or archangel Gabriel."

21:49.160 --> 21:51.480
Gabriel.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.720
Simon.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.200
Mamacita.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.440
Hey, cutie!

23:02.440 --> 23:05.720
Hey, don't let the door hit you!

23:10.640 --> 23:12.600
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand,

23:12.680 --> 23:14.520
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand,

23:14.600 --> 23:16.440
five-one thousand,
six-one thousand,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.440
seven-one thousand,
eight-one thousand,

23:18.520 --> 23:21.040
nine-one thousand,
ten-one thousand.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.320
You guys,
I know you're here.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.040
You guys.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.400
I know
you're in here.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.680
Hello there, young lady.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.880
Hi.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.720
I'm Simon.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.960
What's your name?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.280
- Mary.
- Mary!

24:14.840 --> 24:16.680
Mary.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.640
That's a pretty name.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.560
- Does Miss Henley know you're here?
- No, she doesn't.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.480
No one does.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.840
And I would like to keep it like that,
if we can.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.040
Do you think that you could not
tell anyone that I'm here,

24:32.120 --> 24:34.640
just for
a little while?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.560
Okay.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.720
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

24:40.800 --> 24:42.640
- I have to go.
- Let's go!

24:42.720 --> 24:45.040
Do you have to?

24:45.120 --> 24:48.040
Are you hungry?
I could bring something.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.400
That would be very nice,
Mary.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.160
Okay. Bye.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.720
# Bears love the honey #

25:00.800 --> 25:03.400
# Honey loves the bees #

25:03.480 --> 25:08.960
# We belong together
like monkeys in the trees #

25:09.040 --> 25:10.800
# I'll always love ya #

25:10.880 --> 25:14.000
# We're stuck like glue #

25:14.040 --> 25:17.720
# I wanna be
your best friend too #

25:22.440 --> 25:27.680
# I wanna be
your best friend too ##

25:27.760 --> 25:30.160
Gee, Jerry, you look like shit.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.960
- Leave me alone, Gabriel.
- Soon, pal, soon.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.880
- Come here.
- Go away.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.680
Come here.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.960
You still got a spark of life
left in you.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.440
- Fuck you.
- Hmm.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.120
I want you
to do something for me.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.520
- Why don't you just let me die?
- Soon.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.920
Honest.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.080
Don't start.
You know how I hate that.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.920
I'm so tired.
I'm so goddamn tired.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.600
Watch the profanity.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.000
One more favor.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.880
- What?
- I want you to get something for me.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.240
Some personal effects the cops took
from the Gable Apartments...

26:09.320 --> 26:11.600
on Seventh Street.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.560
It'll be sitting in a property room
on San Julian.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.960
And you just want me to waltz right
in there like this, right?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.720
Go in during
a shift change.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.960
- You got the name the stuff is under?
- John Doe.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.160
- Oh. Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Number 12.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.280
Bus fare.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.720
7-8-25, code six.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.720
105 North Vann, route 52.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.560
Final spectrometry came back on that
fancy Bible of yours.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.920
If that new chapter's
a forgery, it's an old one.

26:50.920 --> 26:55.400
Carbon dating checks out
second century.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.320
That would make this Bible
the oldest in existence then.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.720
So don't lose it.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.640
How's the translation
going?

27:02.720 --> 27:05.520
Well, from what I can
make out so far,

27:05.600 --> 27:09.840
this thing seems to be mostly about
angels and the second war in Heaven.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.880
A second angel war?
Over what?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.600
Us. Humans.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.640
It says when God gave us a soul
some angels became jealous...

27:18.720 --> 27:20.560
and they started this war.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.520
Really? You translated all of that?
Well, when did it end?

27:24.600 --> 27:27.760
It doesn't say it did.
It does prophesy a little, though.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.200
Come on.
Let me show you something.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.080
It's been a while here,
so bear with me.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.480
"And there shall be
a dark soul,

27:35.560 --> 27:39.320
and this soul will eat
other dark souls and so
become their inheritor.

27:39.400 --> 27:44.120
This soul will not rest
in an angel but a man,
and he shall be a warrior."

27:44.200 --> 27:46.120
Nice.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.840
Very nice.
Let me ask you something.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.720
Why wouldn't God just
get rid of the bad angels?

27:51.800 --> 27:54.600
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe He can't.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.160
- Maybe He won't.
- Come on.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.040
Don't be so serious.
It's not like all this is real.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.360
Well, what's in the basement
is real.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.720
And according to this,
it's got a name.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.080
Remember that symbol
on his neck?

28:10.160 --> 28:12.480
According to some ancient
Hebrew cabalists,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.960
that's angelic script
for an angel named Uziel.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.640
Are you saying we have
a dead angel on ice?

28:29.240 --> 28:31.680
Ball three.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.200
- I'm gonna need to see a pass.
- Shh.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.520
- Yeah.
- Stop it.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.880
- Dork!
- It's over. Back to the real world
of learning.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.880
Wait up.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.960
Brian,
have you seen Mary?

30:34.040 --> 30:37.800
- I think she's out back.
- Allison?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.920
We haven't seen her
since lunch.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.280
Were you upstairs?

30:44.280 --> 30:46.640
Mm-hmm. All right.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.520
Until I get back
I want everyone reading...

30:49.560 --> 30:51.560
and being quiet.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.000
Mary?

31:01.480 --> 31:03.320
Mary?

31:13.440 --> 31:16.680
- Mary, come here.
- But Simon and I were...

31:16.760 --> 31:18.600
Now.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.240
Ohh.

31:21.320 --> 31:25.560
I'm not mad at you. I just want you
to go back to class. Okay?

31:25.640 --> 31:27.960
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.840
This is school property.
You can't sleep here.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.880
It wasn't part of the plan.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.960
Are you all right?

31:39.040 --> 31:41.480
Not really.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.040
I'll have to call
the police.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.920
I wish you wouldn't
do that.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.080
They can help you.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.440
No.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.400
Not me.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.160
Please leave, Katherine.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.000
Hi.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.280
Well, now.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.840
I thought you left.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.600
I hid.
I'm very clever.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.640
Oh, yes, you are.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.040
Very clever.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.560
Mary,

32:30.840 --> 32:34.880
I have very little time left.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.720
And since you have been
so nice to me,

32:38.800 --> 32:43.440
there's something that I would very much
like to give to you.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.360
What?

32:45.440 --> 32:48.560
Something very special.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.720
Can you keep a secret?

32:52.800 --> 32:56.200
The biggest secret ever?

32:56.280 --> 32:58.600
What is it?

32:58.640 --> 33:01.200
Come here.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.120
Come here.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.720
It's okay. Come here.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.840
You're a very clever girl.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.480
Close your eyes.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.360
Mary?

33:49.440 --> 33:51.280
Oh, honey.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.360
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel good.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.760
Did you...
Did you eat something?

34:00.800 --> 34:03.600
- Can I go home now?
- Come on.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.760
It's okay.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.239
Emma?

34:29.760 --> 34:33.040
Mary got really sick in school
and I thought she should come home.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.239
I don't feel very good,
Grandma.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.159
Come on, sweetie.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.199
It's all right.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.560
I'll have the school
send for a doctor.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.920
He was just lying
up there.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.480
Most of my deputies
are at a tanker spill right now
and they may be a while.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.400
These people are rarely
any problem.

34:55.480 --> 34:59.240
I'll have one of the boys come
down by tonight or tomorrow
and shoo him out for ya.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.120
All right. I mean, as, as,
as soon as you can.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.160
He was kind of strange.
All right, thanks.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.680
Looks like one of those snow angels
we used to make as kids, you know.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.560
Lay down on
a clean snowbank,

35:23.600 --> 35:25.960
swing your arms
up and down.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.880
You know what this means,
don't you?

35:27.960 --> 35:31.240
Our friend's cleaned out all our
evidence on Mr. Doe here, everything.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.160
Yeah.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.040
- Guard get a good look
at who nailed him?
- Yeah.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.160
Tall.
Smiled a lot.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.200
I think I have to go.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.200
- Where?
- Chimney Rock.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.840
Go.
Figure this out.

35:52.920 --> 35:56.080
Then call,
tell me I'm not crazy.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.960
You like the desert,
Jerry?

36:25.320 --> 36:27.160
You promised.

36:28.280 --> 36:31.280
Soon! Don't be a pest
about it.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.520
Never trust a fucking angel.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.080
I can't see, you know.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.280
Hey, look, man, what the hell
do you need me for, huh?

36:51.320 --> 36:53.200
It's a big universe,
Jerry.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.400
Some things in it
are talking monkey work.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.920
Monkeys. Like you.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.080
Oh. Well,
that's great, Gabe.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.520
Stop!
Stop the car!

37:19.640 --> 37:21.480
Ahh.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.360
I can always smell
a graveyard.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.560
# I went to sleep #

37:48.600 --> 37:50.480
You enjoyin' yourself up there?

37:50.520 --> 37:53.240
I always enjoy
watching you work, Jerry.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.160
How'd I ever get you
in my life?

37:55.240 --> 37:59.800
- Stop. You didn't really
want to kill yourself.
- Oh, no, I did, actually.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.720
I did kill myself,
right?

38:01.800 --> 38:04.240
- I mean, I did do it.
- Ahh, technically.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.400
- So you're just keeping me alive.
- Letting you die slower.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.960
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, man. I'm so in your debt.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.520
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm touched.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.160
Ohh! Fuck.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.080
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.000
Don't hurt it.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.280
Ah. There you go.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.320
That's it.
Brush off. That's it.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.120
Be very careful.
Open it up.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.440
Whoa.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.440
Ah, there it is.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.440
Not much to look at.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.280
It's not what's on
the outside that matters.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.440
It's what's
on the inside.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.360
Oooh!

38:45.440 --> 38:48.200
You are looking at
the cleverest,

38:48.240 --> 38:52.120
meanest, sickest
talking monkey.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.480
I love him.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.720
Time to go.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.560
Gimme a kiss.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.640
It's not here.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.440
- More bad news
for the war effort, huh?
- Shut up!

39:20.720 --> 39:22.560
Jerry, come here.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.440
If you were a soul,

39:26.480 --> 39:28.320
where would you hide?

39:29.680 --> 39:31.800
The hell away from you.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.960
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi, Gabriel.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.200
Long time.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.400
You know why I'm here.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.320
Oh, yes.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.240
Don't have it on you,
by chance.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.080
- No.
- No.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.080
That'd be too easy.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.880
Sorry, man.
You know.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.040
Simon.
Get serious.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.520
So, where's the soul?

40:29.600 --> 40:32.680
You know,
bigger than a bread box;

40:32.720 --> 40:36.120
used to occupy the recently dead
Colonel Hawthorne.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.040
You can't keep it from me, Simon.
The stalemate is over.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.320
Why are you doing this,
Gabriel?

40:42.400 --> 40:45.800
I want what's mine.
I bow to no human in Heaven.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.040
- But the Word...
- No one hears the Word anymore. No one!

40:49.080 --> 40:52.280
- Without the Word...
- There's only the argument.
I'll not step aside.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.920
I will not allow
any talking monkey...

40:57.000 --> 40:59.440
to take my place.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.480
I'll burn down Heaven
to stop it.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.560
I'm so tired of this war.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.760
Reject the lie, Simon.
Join us.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.080
Help us make it like it was
before the monkeys.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.000
You remember?

41:14.320 --> 41:16.960
We cast out
Lucifer's army.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.880
You and I.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.000
We threw their rebel thrones
from the wall.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.840
- They wanted to be gods.
- I don't want to be a god, Simon.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.680
I just want to make it
like it was before the lie,

41:29.760 --> 41:31.600
when He loved us best.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.040
Oh, Gabriel.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.760
When was it
that you lost your grace?

41:42.680 --> 41:44.520
I'd like to help you,

41:44.600 --> 41:46.600
old friend,

41:46.680 --> 41:48.560
but I can't.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.920
I'm not sure who's right,
who's wrong, but it doesn't matter.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.760
Sometimes you just have to
do what you're told.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.560
That's who we are.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.600
You know,
the great thing...

42:03.680 --> 42:05.520
about a conversation
like this?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.720
You never have to
have it again.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.960
You know the routine.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.360
Yes.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.800
Not yet!

42:42.360 --> 42:44.560
Simon.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.080
I can make this last
forever.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.400
This is getting boring,
Simon.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.320
Hey, man...

42:55.400 --> 42:59.400
Where is it? Where did you put it?
Give it to me!

43:01.840 --> 43:04.360
You're an abomination,
Gabriel.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.560
You'll never
get that soul.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.960
You're a tough one,
friend.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.240
Old school.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.160
What's going on, John?

44:13.200 --> 44:15.440
You may want to skip
this one, Katherine.

44:17.440 --> 44:20.240
Were any of your, uh,
students up here?

44:22.080 --> 44:23.920
Mary.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.360
- How is she?
- Same.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.360
- Has she seen the doctor yet?
- He found nothing.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.280
But something is in her.

44:49.360 --> 44:54.280
So we have called the hand trembler
to find if she must have a sing.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.960
"And there shall be
a dark soul,

45:32.040 --> 45:37.000
and this soul will eat other dark
souls and so become their inheritor.

45:37.040 --> 45:40.400
This soul will not rest
in an angel, but a man,

45:40.480 --> 45:42.960
and he shall be
a warrior."

45:50.640 --> 45:52.560
How long ago
was he buried?

45:52.640 --> 45:55.560
- Which time?
- "Which time"? What do you mean?

45:55.600 --> 45:58.800
Somebody dug him up last night.
Local hoods, probably.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.600
I just finished
puttin' him back.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.960
- Did you call the sheriff?
- Sure.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.680
They were busy up at the school this
morning. Some wino burned himself up.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.840
Expectin'
I'll be buryin' him too.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.480
Don't run, don't run.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.160
Don't run!
Don't run.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.120
Can I help you
with something?

46:47.200 --> 46:49.520
Yes, I'm Thomas Dagget
with the police.

46:49.600 --> 46:54.000
- Katherine Henley.
- I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if I may.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.880
- It's about that guy upstairs?
- That's right.

46:56.960 --> 47:00.040
Well, sorry, but I kinda got
my hands full right now.

47:00.080 --> 47:03.880
- Do you mind if I tag along?
Let me help you with that.
- Make yourself useful.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.240
- Hey, you forgot something!
- Thanks.

47:08.280 --> 47:11.520
- What grade is this?
- Oh, it's all of them.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.680
The town doesn't
seem that small.

47:13.720 --> 47:17.520
Well, after the copper mine closed, it
sort of took most of the town with it.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.440
Jade,
you hurry back!

47:19.480 --> 47:22.320
So we just teach out of
this one corner now.

47:22.360 --> 47:26.360
- The rest of the school has
been abandoned for years.
- Hey!

47:26.440 --> 47:29.240
Get him, Danny!

47:29.320 --> 47:31.160
It's happened before,
you know.

47:31.240 --> 47:34.000
Homeless people just looking
for a place to sleep.

47:34.040 --> 47:36.880
Of course, no one's ever
burned themselves up before.

47:36.920 --> 47:40.360
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah. I wanted to know
what he was doing there.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.800
- Did he say?
- No, he didn't say.

47:42.840 --> 47:46.280
I mean, he looked like he was hurt,
bloody, like somebody had cut him.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.680
Is there something going on
I should know about?

47:48.720 --> 47:52.520
Did any of the children come in contact
with him, talk to him in any way?

47:52.560 --> 47:54.920
- Yes.
- Which one?

47:57.240 --> 47:59.120
Well,

48:00.120 --> 48:02.000
she's home sick
today.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.680
I'd like to speak with her parents,
if that's possible.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.600
Well, her parents
are dead.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.320
She lives with her grandmother.
I'd have to ask her.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.760
Did you know
an Arnold Hawthorne?

48:12.840 --> 48:14.920
The colonel.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.320
Did you go
to his funeral?

48:17.360 --> 48:19.880
Everybody did.
He lived here.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.680
Any dark secrets?

48:23.440 --> 48:26.680
There are no secrets in a small town,
Mr. Dagget,

48:26.760 --> 48:29.080
dark or otherwise.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.640
Okay. Thank you.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.560
Sure.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.560
No, not really.
I mean, he lived here but...

48:57.640 --> 49:00.920
- nobody ever really talked to him much.
- Have any family?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.280
Nah, not Hawthorne. Town'll probably
just auction this place.

49:04.360 --> 49:06.600
- Yeah.
- Well, lock up when you're done.

49:06.640 --> 49:08.520
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.520
It's unusual...

52:19.760 --> 52:22.840
to see someone your age
in a church on a weeknight.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.680
Don't get me wrong.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.520
I think it's a sign of excellent
character. You're not from here.

52:29.840 --> 52:33.080
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for something.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.600
- Did you find it?
- I will.

52:36.680 --> 52:40.440
- I found what you're
looking for... Thomas.
- Excuse me?

52:40.520 --> 52:43.760
Do I know you?
How do you know my name?

52:43.800 --> 52:45.720
Ah, you look
like a Thomas.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.920
Hey. Look at me.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.320
You want me to
look at you? Huh?

52:59.720 --> 53:03.200
You know how you got that dent
in your top lip?

53:03.280 --> 53:06.080
Way back,
before you were born,

53:06.160 --> 53:10.320
I told you a secret, then
I put my finger there...

53:10.360 --> 53:12.240
and I said,

53:12.280 --> 53:14.120
"Shh."

54:17.800 --> 54:20.720
Okay?
There and there.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.800
Put your lips there.
Pucker your lips and blow.

54:23.880 --> 54:26.280
Just a little bit.
This trumpet's special.

54:30.800 --> 54:34.280
Very good.
Kevin.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.360
Have a mint.
On me. Huh?

54:36.400 --> 54:40.400
Oooh-ohhh.

54:40.480 --> 54:44.240
What? What, you want an autograph?
Come on, get out of here.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.400
Next.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.560
- Sandra.
- How'd you know my name?

54:50.640 --> 54:53.960
Well, you look like a Sandra.
You have very pretty teeth, Sandra.

54:54.040 --> 54:57.760
- Thank you.
- Let's check 'em. Hmm? Ahh.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.880
- Did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
- A little.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.240
- Did you talk to him?
- No.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.920
- Well, who did, Sandra?
Who talked to the man?
- Mary.

55:10.920 --> 55:14.040
- Where is Mary, Sandra?
- What the hell do you think
you're doing?

55:14.120 --> 55:17.400
- I'm talkin' to the kids, ma'am.
- Sandra, come here.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.800
Come here, honey.

55:19.880 --> 55:23.600
The rest of you inside. Now. Go on.

55:23.680 --> 55:26.960
- Bye, Gabriel.
- See you, kids. Study your math.

55:27.040 --> 55:30.160
Key to the universe.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.760
Bye, Gabriel.

55:32.840 --> 55:37.640
- Who are you?
- That's a long story.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.800
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, everybody else does.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.960
Look, I don't know what's going on here,
but I think you both should leave.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.880
You're right.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.280
You have no idea
what's going on.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.320
- So you saw Simon.
What did he say to you?
- Yes.

56:24.120 --> 56:27.800
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Why? Is something wrong?

56:27.880 --> 56:29.720
Emma.
It's okay, Mary.

56:29.800 --> 56:32.280
You don't have to talk to him.
You don't have to talk to any of them.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.440
He was just asking me
about Simon.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.360
Simon?

56:37.400 --> 56:39.320
What did he say
to you, Mary?

56:39.400 --> 56:42.800
- He asked if I could keep a secret.
- What was that?

56:42.880 --> 56:44.720
Something he gave me.

56:44.800 --> 56:49.200
- What did he give you?
- Then it wouldn't be a secret.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.400
You're a good friend not to tell, Mary.
But I'm a good friend of Simon's too.

56:52.480 --> 56:55.960
So if you want to go ahead and say
what it was, you can to me, okay?

56:56.040 --> 56:57.880
It's a secret.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.960
But sometimes it hurts.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.320
Ever cut off
a Chinaman's head?

57:09.080 --> 57:12.520
They don't bleed.
Not like we do.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.080
Or maybe it
was just the cold.

57:15.120 --> 57:18.440
You could always tell
when they were coming.

57:18.520 --> 57:22.440
Those songs.

57:22.480 --> 57:26.880
They charge through the snow.
Their guns froze.

57:26.960 --> 57:30.760
And that was okay
because we were better.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.680
Colder.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.680
At Chosin, we were colder
than anyone.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.960
Make it stop, Miss Henley!
Make it stop!

57:42.000 --> 57:45.080
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!

57:45.160 --> 57:47.000
Shh.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.960
What are we gonna do?

57:51.000 --> 57:54.120
She's going to have the enemy ghost way.
We leave this afternoon.

57:54.160 --> 57:58.640
- Wh... Where's the ceremony?
- It's at her clan's village.
Old Woman Butte.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.640
You're gonna take her away?
This girl needs a doctor.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.600
She's already seen
a doctor.

58:08.200 --> 58:13.400
Chinamen's heads? Chosin? I've never
heard her talk that way before.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.600
- Is someone teaching that
to your kids in class?
- Yeah, sure.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.960
Right next to Jack and Jill.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.880
Colonel Hawthorne was at Chosin.
Did she talk to him?

58:23.960 --> 58:27.040
She had no contact with him.
He hated children.

58:27.120 --> 58:29.560
This isn't just
about some drunk...

58:29.640 --> 58:32.400
who burned himself up
at the school, is it?

58:34.280 --> 58:36.200
Can you tell me
the truth, Thomas?

58:38.120 --> 58:40.200
Did you ever read
the Bible, Katherine?

58:40.280 --> 58:42.400
Long time ago.

58:42.480 --> 58:47.640
Did you ever notice how in the Bible,
whenever God needed to punish someone...

58:47.720 --> 58:49.720
or make an example,

58:49.800 --> 58:55.320
or whenever God needed a killing,
He sent an angel?

58:55.400 --> 58:59.560
Did you ever wonder what a creature
like that must be like?

58:59.600 --> 59:02.200
A whole existence spent
praising your God,

59:02.280 --> 59:04.680
but always with one wing
dipped in blood.

59:05.960 --> 59:10.480
Would you ever really
want to see an angel?

59:10.560 --> 59:12.880
Why are you asking me this?

59:12.920 --> 59:15.760
They want
Colonel Hawthorne.

59:15.800 --> 59:19.440
They want a dead, forgotten,
psychotic colonel.

59:19.480 --> 59:21.080
They?

59:26.200 --> 59:29.040
There was a man
at my school this morning.

59:29.080 --> 59:32.040
The children
were calling him Gabriel.

59:32.120 --> 59:35.760
He had Sandra on his lap.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.440
What does he want
with my kids?

59:38.480 --> 59:40.360
I don't know, Katherine.

59:42.520 --> 59:45.360
But I gotta find him.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.800
I know where
you can find him.

59:57.280 --> 59:59.600
He was parked right here.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.920
It's cold.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.440
What's that?

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.120
I don't know.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.040
It's angelic script.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.320
Thomas?

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.320
No!

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.960
Saint John was right.
There's a war in Heaven.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.040
Is Gabriel an angel?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.600
He wants something.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.640
Something that's here.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.200
He wants Mary.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.440
Thomas, he wants Mary.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.320
Mary?

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.240
His car.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.520
Get away from her.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.160
Son of a gun. Priest.
Wanna-be. Figured it out.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.120
- Mary?
- Shh.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.080
She won't feel anything, honest.
I have to rip her apart, of course.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.400
Just the way it goes. See, Simon hid
Hawthorne's soul inside her. I need it.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.560
Nice Catholic boy like you, Mr. Dagget,
you should be on my side.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.440
Goddamn it!

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.400
You're gonna have to watch it
with that profanity.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.080
Mary.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.920
Look in my eyes.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.680
Come on, motherfucker!

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.160
Come on, fuck!

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.960
Thanks, man.
You're a sport.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.280
Pest! You have any idea how hard
it is to get one of those?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.200
Why?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.120
I'm an angel. I kill firstborns
while their mamas watch.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.880
I turn cities into salt.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.240
I even, when I feel like it,
rip the souls from little girls.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.400
And from now
till kingdom come,

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.440
the only thing you can count on,
in your existence,

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.400
is never understanding why.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.240
You, give me a kiss.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
- Mary!
- Go! Go!

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.480
You...

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.240
can't... have her!

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.600
Thomas!

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.560
Get that one and a half incher
over to the other side.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.560
We need more!

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.840
- You don't understand.
You gotta cuff him.
- He's dead.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.600
- He's not dead.
You gotta cuff him, do you hear me?
- Bob, just do it.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.360
Do it!

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.560
All right, Jack. Cuff him.
Put him in my car.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.160
- All right.
- They got him. They got him.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.880
- Wh... Where's Mary?
- She's here. She's here.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.800
Hey.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.200
On Earth, they're not immortal.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.400
They're not like you and me.
You've got to cut their hearts out.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.840
Come on.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.400
We gotta go.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.040
Let's go. Let's go.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.399
This is a good place.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.439
Separate water source.
Stocked grain.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.760
Only one possible approach.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.760
A man could,
with the proper defenses,

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.479
hold off
an entire battalion.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.520
Hi.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.600
Can I help you?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.640
Yeah, someone's gonna die. Soon. Here.
I'll just be a minute.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.040
Uh, there's no visitors
allowed in I.C.U.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.600
Timing is so important.
I smell these things.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.520
Shh.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.920
So.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.520
"Nancy."
Recovering? Hmm.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.240
Recovering? Huh.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.080
Stable?
Get out of here.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.720
Deteriorating.
Critical.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.640
My favorite.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.160
Rachael.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.000
Not yet. Come back.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.880
Come on, back it up.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.800
That's it. Come on back.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.160
Ooh. Ahh.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.760
- Hi!
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.520
Shh.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.880
Don't start.
I hate that.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.440
Come on, don't start.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.720
It's only
for a short time.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.640
Promise.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.320
Hello, Katherine.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.120
We must talk.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.840
- Oh, my God.
- God?

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.200
God is love.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.240
I don't love you.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.760
L... I can't.
I can't do this.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.400
I can lay you out and fill your mouth
with your mother's feces.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.640
Or we can talk.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.000
- Are you one of them?
- Them?

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.800
Are you an angel?

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.760
I am the first angel,
loved once above all others.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.320
A perfect love.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.280
# But like all true love #

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.920
# One day it withered
on the vine ##

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.800
Ahh, the winged party boy
is about.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.400
Come to feed on the guts
of your little Mary.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.800
- Are you a part of it?
- No, Katherine.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.480
Other angels have made this war
because they hate you.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.200
You and all humans.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.240
God has put you in His grace
and pushed them aside.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.560
They're desperate. They've never been
able to conquer the other loyal angels.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.200
And so this war has remained
in stalemate for thousands of years.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:20.080
And while this state
of affairs endures,

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.440
no soul can meet its God.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.040
Your parents and their parents
and so on, from the beginning,

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.160
lie still in wormy earth.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.480
Of course, some of them
do come to me eventually.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:36.360
For while Heaven may be closed,
I am always open, even on Christmas.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.240
Gabriel has a plan.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.680
Humans... and how I love
you talking monkeys for this...

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.000
know more about war
and treachery of the spirit...

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.400
than any angel.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.840
Gabriel is well aware
of this...

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.360
and has found a way to steal the
blackest soul on Earth to fight for him.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.800
If he wins, Heaven opens.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.720
I know that this new Heaven
will just be another Hell.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.200
You see, I'm not here to help you
and the little bitch...

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.760
because I love you
or because I care for you,

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.040
but because two hells
is one hell too many...

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.960
and I can't have that.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.360
What I'm offering you
is a chance not only to save Mary,

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.800
but to finally open Heaven
to your kind.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.760
What do you say?

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.840
I saw the devil tonight.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.400
If you have something to say,

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.360
why can't you say it
to me?

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.160
Thomas.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.920
I had a voice once,
Katherine.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:37.480
For as long as I could remember,
I had a voice...

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.240
that called me to my God,
that called me to church.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.920
And on the day that I needed
that voice the most,

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.160
it left me.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.680
It's better never
having known that voice.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.760
All I know is that I'm not going to let
anything happen to Mary.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.680
All right?

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.200
Say, ma'am,

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.800
any idea where I can find
Old Woman Butte?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.800
Yeah, it's on
the reservation.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.560
Don't suppose you could be
just a tad more specific,

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.440
Madge?

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:43.760
The light.
It was so...

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.800
br... bright.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.280
- Isn't your friend hungry?
- What?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.600
Not for a while, I'm afraid.
Funniest thing.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.280
Don't do that.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.360
- Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cutoff.
- Right.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.480
First dirt road, go left 20, 25 miles.
You'll see it.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.520
Much obliged.
Let's get crackin', Rachael.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.520
No.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:18.320
Eternity here.
In that sagging skin suit.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.240
Or one more day with me.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280
Why?

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.000
Can't drive.
But I can wait.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.120
Until the stars burn out,
if you don't make up your mind.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.040
I doubt we'll meet again.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.840
- Suits me.
- Thank Heaven.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.680
Little Tommy Dagget.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.760
How I loved listening
to your sweet prayers every night.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.760
And then you'd jump in your bed,
so afraid I was under there.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.680
And I was.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.000
Do you know what hell
really is, Thomas?

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.480
It's not lakes of burning oil
or chains of ice.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.040
It's being removed
from God's sight,

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.760
having His Word taken
from you.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.720
It's hard to believe. So hard.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.880
I know that better
than anyone.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.800
And there's your weapon.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.720
Think, Thomas, think.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.760
What is the one thing
essential to an angel,

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.920
the thing that holds
his entire being together?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.960
Faith.
Faith, faith.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.160
And what would happen
if that faith was tested,

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.120
and an angel just like you...

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.040
didn't understand?

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.640
Use that.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.560
Use it!

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.240
He's coming.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.200
Go inside,
lock the door.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.480
There's one shot.
Okay?

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.040
It'll be okay.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.240
You're gonna love it,
Rachael.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.080
It'll be our night
to howl.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.080
Nice move.
Beautifully done.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.560
Tommy, you've got to
come work for me.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.720
Upstairs.
L... I could get you in now.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.440
You'll love it.
Nobody tells you when to go to bed.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.520
You eat all
the ice cream you want.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.720
You get to kill... all day,

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.680
all night,
just like an angel!

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.520
Save yourself, friend!

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.360
Why go to the wall for that bitch
and her rug rat?

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.880
It all turns out the same
anyway. Now, later.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.320
I'm gonna rip
that kid apart.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.520
I'm not an angel!
I'm just a man.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.120
Which means I got something
you don't. It's a soul.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.120
This is gonna really hurt.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.040
Your war...

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.720
Make it good.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.000
- Your war is a lie!
- Right.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.520
It's not about humans.
It's about God.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.200
What do you know
about that, you monkey?

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.640
I don't have to, Gabriel.
I know you.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.120
I know what it's like
to be ignored, pushed aside.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.080
I know your anger. I know what it's like
to lose your faith in the Word.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.000
I know.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.360
'Cause you hate Him.
You hate Him just a little bit.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.280
'Cause you're jealous.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.600
That's what this war's about...
jealousy.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.720
Jealousy that He could love
something more than you.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.520
Something with a soul.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.960
Well.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.840
If you wanted to prove
your side was right, Gabriel,

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.760
so badly,

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.440
why didn't you just ask Him?

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.040
Why didn't you just ask God?

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.720
Because...

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.520
He doesn't talk to me
anymore.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.680
Gabriel!

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.200
- I'm getting so fed up with you.
- Go to hell.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.560
Heaven, darling, Heaven.
At least get the zip code right.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.520
It's all the same to you,
isn't it?

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.960
No. In Heaven,
we believe in love.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.600
- What do you love, Gabriel?
- Cracking your skull.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.000
Kill me!

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.640
Oh, God!

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.920
Mary!

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.760
Go home.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.560
Go home!

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.840
Finish it.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.480
Long time.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.520
This war is mine.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.760
Your war is arrogance.
That makes it evil.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.320
That's mine.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.440
Lucifer, sitting
in your basement,

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.360
sulking over your breakup
with the boss.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.480
You're nothing.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.080
Time to come home,
Gabriel.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.560
The enemy ghost is gone.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.000
The war's over.
It's done.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.040
No. I want you both
to come home with me.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.360
Never. "I love you.
I love you more than Jesus."

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.520
You owe me one.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.080
- You're gonna ask me to take you home.
- No.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.120
You will. Because anything else will
be worse than you could ever imagine.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.280
Katherine.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.600
I have my soul.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.760
And I have my faith.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.160
What do you have... angel?

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.360
Leave the light on,
Thomas.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.040
Is he coming back?

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.680
I don't think so.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.080
And in the end I think
it must be about faith.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.600
And if faith is a choice,

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.520
then it can be lost...

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.280
for a man, an angel...

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.000
or the devil himself.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.440
And if faith means never
completely understanding God's plan,

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:26.480
then maybe understanding
just a part of it, our part,

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.160
is what it is
to have a soul.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.000
And maybe, in the end,

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.840
that's what being human is
after all.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.040
# What was it you once said #

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.480
# Few of the things
in life #

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.120
# Are clear to me #

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.760
# Not for a second
did I believe you #

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.520
# Not for a minute
did I believe you #

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:48.240
# But within your need
you lie alone #

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:55.160
# This empty space
you call your home #

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.800
# If you just let me in #

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:07.080
# I wouldn't let you
break down #

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:14.440
# Like I'm breakin' down #

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.520
# I think you thought
the rain #

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.160
# Could wash away the day #

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.080
# And clean you #

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.760
# Not for a second
did I believe it #

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.600
# Not for a minute
did I believe it #

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.240
# Within your need
you lie alone #

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:55.400
# This empty space
you call your home #

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:59.920
# If you just let me in #

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.720
# I wouldn't let you
break down, ah #

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.880
# 'Cause I'm breakin' down #

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.320
# If you just let me in #

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:24.960
# I wouldn't let you
break down #

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.640
# 'Cause I'm breakin' down #

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.080
# I'm breakin' #

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:38.120
# Down #

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.360
# If you just let me in #

01:32:54.440 --> 01:33:01.360
# I wouldn't let you
break down, no #

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:08.120
# 'Cause I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down #

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.520
# If you just let me in #

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.680
# I wouldn't let you #

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.440
# Break down #

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.040
# I'm breakin' down #

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.400
# I'm breakin' down #

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:36.280
# I'm breakin' down ##
