The acetone I'm pouring
into this glass capsule

00:20.063 --> 00:23.675
is the key to my design,
the linchpin to a three-step,

00:23.719 --> 00:25.199
chemical-mechanical
chain reaction.

00:25.242 --> 00:28.158
Using this, my colleagues
and I have been able

00:28.202 --> 00:31.379
to achieve the one hour delay
between payload deployment

00:31.422 --> 00:35.209
and the firing pin release
that you gentlemen requested.

00:35.252 --> 00:38.081
What of the, uh, failures
mentioned in your report?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.170
We have cut

00:40.214 --> 00:42.129
the fuse's
fail rate down

00:42.172 --> 00:44.914
to approximately ten percent.
Perfect.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.482
There's an automobile factory
we can convert to put this

00:47.525 --> 00:49.397
into production immediately.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.659
Excellent work, Dr. Tutelman.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.709
Gentlemen.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.408
Hey, why the long face?

01:00.451 --> 01:02.192
You know, it's ideas
like yours that are

01:02.236 --> 01:03.498
gonna help us win this war.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.935
You ever stop to think
about the cost?

01:05.978 --> 01:07.589
I didn't become
a scientist

01:07.632 --> 01:10.548
to dream up clever ways
to kill people. You?

02:09.912 --> 02:13.437
Super cool, right?

02:13.481 --> 02:16.353
The egg drop experiment
is all about decreasing

02:16.397 --> 02:18.486
something called
"impact force."

02:18.529 --> 02:19.704
When that egg
hit the ground,

02:19.748 --> 02:21.837
it broke because
impact forces were high,

02:21.880 --> 02:24.187
like in a
car accident.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.623
But if my assistant Riley here

02:25.667 --> 02:28.626
places the egg inside
of a cushioned container...

02:28.670 --> 02:30.846
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.895
...the egg survives,

02:36.939 --> 02:38.680
because impact forces
were low,

02:38.723 --> 02:40.551
like when a car
pulls off the highway

02:40.595 --> 02:42.162
and slows to a gentle stop.

02:42.205 --> 02:45.165
Now, if you guys

02:45.208 --> 02:47.036
want to earn your
Nova Science Badge,

02:47.079 --> 02:49.038
you have one week

02:49.081 --> 02:52.694
to build a container that allows
an egg to be dropped from that

02:52.737 --> 02:54.261
exact same height
without breaking.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.481
Got any questions?

03:01.006 --> 03:02.312
Yes.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.358
Why do I have to learn
this science stuff?

03:04.401 --> 03:06.186
I want to do archery.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.057
Because it helps
you solve problems.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.233
Riley and I use
all this "science stuff"

03:10.277 --> 03:12.104
in our jobs all the time.
Your jobs?

03:12.148 --> 03:14.716
Sound super boring.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.547
Actually, we do
all sorts of cool things

03:19.590 --> 03:20.765
over at the
think tank.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.293
Hey, babe,
now's not a good time.

03:26.336 --> 03:29.513
I'm at a work thing.
Ooh.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.559
She's using her sexy work voice.

03:31.602 --> 03:34.083
I like it. So what time will you
be home tonight, Miss Davis?

03:34.126 --> 03:36.651
Uh, few hours. Why, what's up?

03:36.694 --> 03:38.130
Oh, I'm cooking dinner,

03:38.174 --> 03:40.568
Fusilli alla Vodka, and I needed
to time the sauce right,

03:40.611 --> 03:43.571
so, uh, I thought
we could lay low,

03:43.614 --> 03:45.007
watch a movie.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.574
That sounds amazing.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.402
I'll call when
I'm on the way home, okay?

03:48.445 --> 03:51.274
I'll be waiting for you.
Bye.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.798
Everything okay?
Uh, yeah.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.713
Yeah, it's my dad.
Oh.

03:55.757 --> 03:56.714
Right.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.281
What's up?
Oh.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.588
Our Matty.

04:00.631 --> 04:03.199
Go handle this. All right,
kids, we're done here.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.075
Sorry,
got here as quick as we could

04:10.119 --> 04:12.295
Pay attention, Mac,

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
'cause this one's got your name
written all over it.

04:15.342 --> 04:18.170
Riley was helping me volunteer
at the Cub Scouts,

04:18.214 --> 04:19.302
didn't have time
to change.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.261
And I for one am so glad
that you didn't.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.784
Oh, that
makes two of us.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.612
All right, if we're done
making fun of Blondie,

04:24.655 --> 04:25.700
listen up.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.005
Three hours ago,

04:27.049 --> 04:28.442
there was an explosion
at a building

04:28.485 --> 04:31.096
undergoing renovations
in Karlsruhe, Germany.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.489
This is what's left.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.099
We don't know what
caused the blast,

04:34.143 --> 04:37.277
but CCTV of the surrounding area
suggests that it originated

04:37.320 --> 04:40.671
within or below the building's
concrete foundation.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.804
That's weird, right?

04:42.847 --> 04:45.720
Super weird 'cause it means
it wasn't a ruptured gas line

04:45.763 --> 04:47.112
or an electrical
malfunction,

04:47.156 --> 04:50.115
and there are no subterranean
natural resources

04:50.159 --> 04:52.509
in that part of Europe
with any combustible properties.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.598
What we do know is that,
when the building collapsed,

04:54.642 --> 04:56.644
dozens of construction workers
from the weekend shift

04:56.687 --> 04:57.819
were trapped inside.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.690
So it's a rescue op.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.345
With some engineering
challenges, which you are

05:02.389 --> 05:03.694
uniquely qualified to solve.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.348
This is a highly
technical,

05:05.392 --> 05:07.524
not to mention dangerous,
operation.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.352
I want you to have
every resource

05:09.396 --> 05:10.658
the second you need it,

05:10.701 --> 05:12.181
so I'll be staying back
with Matty

05:12.224 --> 05:13.487
to help coordinate.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.792
Desi has experience
in search and rescue,

05:14.836 --> 05:16.533
so she will be
joining you as well.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.143
Now get moving.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.363
Details on the building are
waiting for you on the plane.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.119
Thank you for traveling
so quickly,

05:37.162 --> 05:39.861
although I'm still not clear
on how your team can help.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.625
The structure is still settling.
Every minute, it moves.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.235
Attempting a rescue

06:06.278 --> 06:10.500
before it's stabilized means
risking serious injury or death.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.766
Tell them that.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.949
Problem, our only entrance
into the building

06:24.993 --> 06:26.298
is blocked by a massive chunk

06:26.342 --> 06:28.475
of concrete. All right, one...

06:28.518 --> 06:30.868
two...

06:30.912 --> 06:32.479
insert a makeshift lever

06:32.522 --> 06:34.481
and apply force
against a static point.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.054
You were right, Mac.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.447
This'll work to access
the basement levels.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.144
I got the missing
workers' approximate locations

06:46.188 --> 06:49.452
using their
radio signal strength.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.275
You didn't tell me
you had any experience

07:30.319 --> 07:32.495
with search and rescue.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.889
2017.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.762
I was part of the military group
assigned to find survivors

07:38.806 --> 07:42.679
after the earthquake in Iraq.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.898
Oh, I remember that one,

07:43.941 --> 07:45.682
it was huge.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.815
It was a magnitude seven,
wasn't it?

07:47.858 --> 07:50.644
7.3.

07:50.687 --> 07:51.906
I need help!
Mac, Desi.

07:54.604 --> 07:57.825
We need medics over here.
Are you okay?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.522
We're gonna get you out of here.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.488
Everyone okay?

08:08.531 --> 08:10.620
Yeah.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.492
Kind of.

08:15.059 --> 08:18.498
Matty, EMTs are treating a man
with minor injuries.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.717
He's gonna be okay.
All right, everyone.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.763
Split up and keep moving.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.507
Ah. There you are.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.638
Russ. The gang all right

08:28.682 --> 08:30.292
in Germany?
Anything I can do to help?

08:30.335 --> 08:35.035
That is an excellent question,
Bozer, and the answer is no.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.515
Actually,

08:36.558 --> 08:39.562
there doesn't appear
to be anything you can do.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.782
All right...

08:41.825 --> 08:43.827
And therein lies the rub.
You see, that answer

08:43.871 --> 08:45.699
has set me down a path
to other questions.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.135
For example,

08:47.178 --> 08:50.051
what exactly is the
function of this lab?

08:50.094 --> 08:52.314
Why is it
so expensive?

08:52.357 --> 08:55.404
And for the
love of God,

08:55.447 --> 08:57.711
what the hell
is that?

08:57.754 --> 09:00.714
This is Sparky, he's a...Hideous, agreed,

09:00.757 --> 09:03.238
and very, very costly,
to the tune of, what?

09:03.281 --> 09:07.068
$3.6 million. American.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.897
I mean, he's a state of the art
artificial intelligence,

09:09.940 --> 09:12.116
doesn't come cheap.
The thing about robotics...Oh, Bozer.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.901
What is it that you do here?

09:13.944 --> 09:15.772
Uh, I'm installing an upgrade

09:15.816 --> 09:17.295
to Sparky's memory processor.
No, I mean here

09:17.339 --> 09:19.733
at the Phoenix, in this lab.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.910
What do I do here?
Mm.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.651
What do I do here?

09:24.694 --> 09:27.828
All sorts of things, okay?
For your information,

09:27.871 --> 09:29.656
from this very room,
which you stand,

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
I've saved the world
hundreds of times.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.050
The best of
my knowledge,

09:33.094 --> 09:35.662
it's been half a dozen assists,
at best.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.926
Okay. All right.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.102
But while we're
on the subject, sir,

09:41.145 --> 09:43.626
exactly what is it
you do here,

09:43.670 --> 09:45.106
besides write checks?

09:45.149 --> 09:49.632
Are you challenging me, hmm?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.329
To prove my worth?

09:51.373 --> 09:53.941
Are you challenging me
to prove mine?

09:53.984 --> 09:55.769
Oh, yes.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.292
Then ditto.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.997
Well, this
should be fun.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.423
Hey, guys? I'm at the site
of the explosion.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.599
Everything that I'm seeing here
supports the theory

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
that this blast came
from beneath

10:44.687 --> 10:46.036
the building's foundation.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.473
I just still don't understand
how it's possible.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.173
Huh.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.699
That's weird, too.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.179
What's weird too?

11:00.181 --> 11:03.706
Shrapnel expelled from
the detonation point.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.753
It's curved.
Heavily oxidized.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.016
As in rust?

11:24.553 --> 11:27.730
I know what
caused the explosion.

11:27.774 --> 11:32.474
It was a bomb dropped on Germany
during World War II.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.910
It didn't explode

11:33.954 --> 11:36.565
and it remained buried
underground for decades,

11:36.608 --> 11:38.001
until yesterday.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.134
When construction
finally disturbed it,

11:40.177 --> 11:41.657
and it went off.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.180
How could you
possibly know that?

11:43.224 --> 11:45.748
Because those bombs
were dropped in clusters.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.751
And I'm staring at a second one

11:48.795 --> 11:52.363
that could go off
at any moment.

11:58.761 --> 11:59.762
You were right, Mac.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.808
On November 5, 1944,

12:01.851 --> 12:03.853
U.S. 8th Air Force dropped
hundreds of bombs

12:03.897 --> 12:05.550
on Karlsruhe, Germany.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.510
Their intended target:
one of Hitler's railyards.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.120
Let me guess:
that railyard was located

12:10.164 --> 12:11.469
exactly where we are right now.

12:11.513 --> 12:14.081
So this bomb fell here
75 years ago,

12:14.124 --> 12:16.126
and it's just been waiting
for the right moment

12:16.170 --> 12:17.737
to ruin everyone's lives?

12:17.780 --> 12:21.131
That's insane.
Where does finding
this thing leave our

12:21.175 --> 12:23.960
search and rescue operation?
German EMTs managed to locate

12:24.004 --> 12:25.527
three more survivors,

12:25.570 --> 12:27.355
leaving ten
still left unaccounted for,

12:27.398 --> 12:28.748
but finding them
could take days.

12:28.791 --> 12:31.185
And if that bomb goes off,
they'll all be killed.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.883
Therefore, Mac, Riley,
your new priority

12:33.927 --> 12:35.972
is neutralizing the bomb threat
ASAP.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.888
Desi? You'll continue
to search for missing workers.
Copy that.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.760
I'll send the locations of
their radios to your phone.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.200
No pressure, but, uh...
please don't let us blow up.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.593
Thanks.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.859
Okay.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.208
So...

12:54.251 --> 12:55.862
so how do we
defuse this thing?

12:55.905 --> 12:57.864
I have no idea.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.561
Yeah, Army

12:59.604 --> 13:01.868
EOD training didn't cover
mid-century relics.

Voilà.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.234
Everything you wanted to know

13:20.277 --> 13:22.192
about World War II explosives,

13:22.236 --> 13:23.933
but were too afraid to ask.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.369
You see, this is what I do.

13:25.413 --> 13:28.590
Think outside the box.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.852
Excuse me.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.898
What the hell
are you doing?

13:31.941 --> 13:34.509
And this is
what I do Hello.

13:34.552 --> 13:37.512
My name is Russell Taylor.
My friends call me Russ.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.992
Uh, my associates and I
are here--

13:39.035 --> 13:41.298
Well, we're here for your bomb.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.083
I authorized
no such thing.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.259
Yes, but as you can see,
the, uh,

13:45.302 --> 13:47.435
Department of
Defense has.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.002
No. This has
to be cleared

13:49.045 --> 13:50.481
through the Office
of Antiquities...

13:50.525 --> 13:52.048
Unfortunately,
there's no time,

13:52.092 --> 13:53.441
which is why my associates

13:53.484 --> 13:55.269
will have to cut through
this glass.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.924
But I think we'd much prefer
your assistance in this matter

13:57.967 --> 14:02.232
rather than destroy your
very, very fine display.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.320
So, if you could just

14:03.364 --> 14:05.801
unlock the case for us,
then, uh...

14:05.845 --> 14:08.064
...then we'll be on our way.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.283
I will not.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.460
There is a protocol
to follow, and this

14:12.503 --> 14:13.809
is in violation of that...I... I understand.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.810
I understand.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.812
You're afraid of being fired,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.335
thereby derailing
your career

14:18.379 --> 14:21.121
in historical military
restoration.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.644
It's true.
Your wavering eyes

14:22.687 --> 14:24.211
betray a lack
of self-confidence,

14:24.254 --> 14:26.648
and judging by the prominent
display of "assistant"

14:26.691 --> 14:28.258
in your title,
I can tell

14:28.302 --> 14:31.305
that promotion has been
difficult for you to achieve.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.654
How dare you.
Chasing your dream

14:32.697 --> 14:34.656
is never a mistake.

14:34.699 --> 14:38.486
And while you suffer disrespect
from your superiors,

14:38.529 --> 14:41.968
due in no small part
to the ungodly injury

14:42.011 --> 14:45.275
that your Chicago accent
plays on the queen's English,

14:45.319 --> 14:48.191
I for one...

14:48.235 --> 14:50.324
I believe in you.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.326
You... you do?

14:52.369 --> 14:54.937
I do. So if you hand
over the keys to the case,

14:54.981 --> 14:58.332
I'll make a few calls,
and we'll see if we can't

14:58.375 --> 15:01.204
get you up a few rungs
of the ladder around here, hmm?

15:06.862 --> 15:08.081
I miss Chicago so much.

15:17.046 --> 15:20.006
And boom goes the dynamite.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.007
As the saying goes.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.573
Nope. No, it doesn't.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.618
I think it does.
Not at all.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.976
Matty, David Kruger,
37 years old,

15:34.020 --> 15:35.978
is on his way up
with a broken leg.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.719
Vitals are stable.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.547
Seven more to go.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.984
Copy that. Comms are back up
and radio channels are clear.

15:42.028 --> 15:42.985
Hello?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.077
Hello?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.731
I'm a rescue worker
here to help.

15:49.774 --> 15:50.993
Do you speak English?

15:51.037 --> 15:53.822
There's something heavy
on my leg and I...

15:53.865 --> 15:55.867
I can't move!

15:55.911 --> 15:57.260
Can you tell me your name

15:57.304 --> 15:58.870
and where you are
in the building?

15:58.914 --> 16:01.308
My name is Helen Beck.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.876
I'm a project manager
overseeing the renovations.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.226
I don't know where I am.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.881
I was walking
to the mail room and then

16:09.925 --> 16:13.102
I don't know what happened.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.190
I woke up here.

16:14.234 --> 16:18.673
Please tell my husband and sons

16:18.716 --> 16:20.980
that I'm okay.

16:24.113 --> 16:27.377
Matty? I made contact
with a survivor whose radio

16:27.421 --> 16:28.857
isn't showing up on Riley's map.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.859
Her name is Helen Beck.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.861
Sounds like she suffered
a concussion.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.384
We'll see what we can do.
Helen?

16:34.428 --> 16:36.517
We're getting in touch with
your family right now, okay?

16:36.560 --> 16:37.692
Listen to me.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.302
I'm gonna find you.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.261
Just stay with me

16:41.304 --> 16:43.959
and keep talking, okay?

16:44.829 --> 16:46.527
Now tell me about your sons.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.009
Right, I've got
the restored bomb

16:50.052 --> 16:52.837
through teardown, and I've
pieced together how it works.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.883
Yeah, it was my idea,
but whatever.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.493
Team effort.
The bomb you found

16:56.537 --> 17:00.584
is a 1,000-pound AN-M65.
It's totally standard for 1944.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.587
What's interesting about this
is the fuse inside it.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.721
It was designed to create
a one-hour time delay

17:06.763 --> 17:08.069
from when the bomb
was dropped from the plane

17:08.114 --> 17:09.070
to when it exploded--

17:09.115 --> 17:11.551
if it failed to detonate
on impact.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.249
So why didn't this one blow up?

17:13.292 --> 17:14.816
Well, believe it or not,

17:14.858 --> 17:17.426
these fuses had a ten percent
fail rate, usually because

17:17.471 --> 17:21.214
the glass capsule containing
the acetone didn't shatter.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.215
Then the countdown never began.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.394
There's a half a centimeter
of 75-year-old glass

17:27.436 --> 17:28.743
between us and this thing
going off?

17:28.786 --> 17:30.571
Bingo.

17:30.614 --> 17:31.963
But...

17:32.007 --> 17:33.574
it's not all bad news.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.751
Found a pamphlet distributed
to the Imperial Japanese Army

17:36.794 --> 17:38.927
with instructions for how
soldiers should deal with

17:38.970 --> 17:40.450
one of these things if found.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.410
So you... you solved
how to defuse this thing?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.977
Yes, after I translated it
into English,

17:46.021 --> 17:47.283
so that we could all
make sense of it.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.372
Point is, the detonator
can be removed

17:49.416 --> 17:51.287
from the nose cone
using a simple tool.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.724
Sending photos now.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.727
Okay, yeah.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.599
So we know how to defuse it.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.253
Now we just have
to figure out a way

18:00.296 --> 18:02.472
to lift this monster
out of the dirt.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.779
Any ideas?

18:09.827 --> 18:11.177
Got it?
Yeah.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.662
So, uh,
how's your dad?

18:20.447 --> 18:23.189
From the call earlier today.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.930
Oh, yeah, he-he's good.
You know Elwood.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.020
You really want to play
catch up right now?

18:29.064 --> 18:31.675
Honestly, talking keeps
my hands steady.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.764
Plus, if this thing blows up
in our faces...

18:33.808 --> 18:38.160
...I want to
make sure I get to

18:38.204 --> 18:41.859
the bottom of this secret
you're hiding.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.167
You don't smile like that

18:45.211 --> 18:46.342
when you're on the phone
with your dad.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.952
I've caught you doing it
a few times

18:47.996 --> 18:49.084
since we've been back,

18:49.128 --> 18:52.479
but I figured...
if things got serious,

18:52.522 --> 18:54.263
you would let me know
who the lucky man was.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.180
So, do you think things
will get serious?

18:58.224 --> 19:00.617
We've been living together
for six months now.

19:00.661 --> 19:01.966
Surprise.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.664
Six months?

19:03.707 --> 19:08.625
I mean, why would you,
uh, lie about that?

19:08.669 --> 19:10.497
Lie is a bit of a strong
word, don't you think?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.499
It's not like you've rushed
to tell me

19:12.542 --> 19:13.674
why you and Desi broke up.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.371
That's different.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.201
Okay, well, we don't
owe each other explanations

19:19.245 --> 19:20.333
about our private lives

19:20.376 --> 19:21.856
just because
we work together.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.428
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh,

19:28.471 --> 19:29.864
start putting
these in here,

19:29.907 --> 19:31.474
okay? Just keep
tension on the pole.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.442
If there's a silver lining
to spending time

19:42.485 --> 19:44.052
in a half-destroyed building,
it's that there's lots of

19:44.095 --> 19:45.793
heavy stuff lying around
to play with.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.143
For example, chunks
of concrete rubble

19:48.187 --> 19:50.624
to load into this
DIY crane and ballast

19:50.667 --> 19:52.887
to lift this monster
out of the dirt.

20:05.073 --> 20:08.729
Yeah, we should stop there.
That's enough.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.864
Didn't Bozer say there's
supposed to be a hatch?

20:13.908 --> 20:17.085
Well, yeah, but his has been in

20:17.128 --> 20:19.087
a temperature-controlled museum.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.742
Ours has been
corroding underground

20:21.785 --> 20:25.485
for 75 years. It's rusted over.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.928
This thing takes one hit
at the wrong angle

20:33.971 --> 20:35.103
and everyone
in this building dies.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.105
We can't wait.
We have to do something.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.325
Okay, so the detonator is stuck

20:39.368 --> 20:42.284
inside the bomb. The people
are stuck in the building.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.939
The only variable that we can
manipulate is removing

20:44.982 --> 20:46.419
the bomb
from the building,

20:46.462 --> 20:47.594
but I don't know how.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.683
This dinosaur weighs
half a ton.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.032
Only one option,

20:51.075 --> 20:52.729
take the bomb
with us.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.731
Back the way we came in.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.092
Okay, Matty, the bomb's
officially mobile.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.660
Are German police on board
with our new plan?

21:10.704 --> 21:12.227
Yes, they've arranged for

21:12.271 --> 21:14.621
a construction crane to lift
the bomb out of the building

21:14.664 --> 21:16.275
and then lower it
onto a flatbed truck,

21:16.318 --> 21:18.015
so that it can be driven
out of the city.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.930
But?

21:19.974 --> 21:21.236
The bottom floors
of the building

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
are all covered in rubble.
The closest point

21:23.325 --> 21:24.674
where the crane can attach
is a window

21:24.718 --> 21:26.502
on the south side
of the sixth floor.

21:26.546 --> 21:30.245
That means transporting it
up 156 steps,

21:30.289 --> 21:31.768
divided by
six landings,

21:31.812 --> 21:35.076
plus 200 feet laterally
to the edge of the building.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.121
Not to mention this
thing weighs half a Volkswagen.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.341
And do we even know
how hard we'd have to bump

21:39.385 --> 21:40.951
into it for it
to blow up?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.518
Well, each of these

21:42.562 --> 21:44.912
was manufactured by hand,
which means they're all

21:44.955 --> 21:46.783
slightly different, not
to mention the degree to which

21:46.827 --> 21:50.570
each individual fuse component
deteriorated underground.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.006
The best I can tell,

21:52.049 --> 21:54.530
the bomb that blew up
the building went off due to

21:54.574 --> 21:56.227
vibrations from construction,
yet this one was

21:56.271 --> 21:58.882
stable enough to survive
that blast, so

21:58.926 --> 22:00.797
I think it's safe to say
that there is just too many

22:00.841 --> 22:02.756
unknown variables
at play here to answer

22:02.799 --> 22:04.801
that question with any
reasonable degree of accuracy.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.673
So in other words,
you have no idea.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.849
Just cut to the chase
next time, Mac;

22:08.892 --> 22:10.677
just say, "No idea."

22:10.720 --> 22:12.722
So we need to find
a way to get the bomb

22:12.766 --> 22:14.028
up the stairs
without bumping it.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.682
Which is where we come in.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.075
I attached electronic sensors
to the restored bomb's

22:18.119 --> 22:19.599
mechanical parts,
so we could

22:19.642 --> 22:22.384
crash test Mac's ideas
on how to lift it up the stairs

22:22.428 --> 22:24.517
before you attempt with the
version that could explode.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.475
I'm a big fan of that idea.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.129
Which is why we came up with it.

22:28.172 --> 22:31.959
So what is
idea nummer eins?

22:38.966 --> 22:42.273
Helen, I'm near the mail room,
which means you can't be far.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.014
You hanging in there?

22:44.058 --> 22:46.452
Never better. Why do you ask?

22:46.495 --> 22:49.455
Anyone who can crack a joke
at a time like this

22:49.498 --> 22:51.195
is gonna be okay.

22:54.503 --> 22:59.160
How often do you find yourself
in situations like this?

23:03.686 --> 23:05.732
Last time I was in
a collapsed building

23:05.775 --> 23:09.605
was in 2017 in Iraq.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.391
There was an earthquake...

23:12.434 --> 23:14.262
and I spent three days
searching for a survivor

23:14.305 --> 23:17.091
in an apartment building,

23:17.134 --> 23:18.788
but, hey,

23:18.832 --> 23:20.964
they weren't lucky enough
to have a radio.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.837
Then how did you know

23:23.880 --> 23:25.186
they were still alive?

23:25.229 --> 23:27.144
I heard them tapping
on a metal pipe.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.452
Believe it or not,
that sound can carry for miles.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.976
I just kept searching

23:33.020 --> 23:36.327
because as long as I heard
that tapping sound,

23:36.371 --> 23:39.200
I knew there was still hope.

23:39.243 --> 23:42.203
And did you find them?

23:48.862 --> 23:50.864
Of course I did.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.398
And you just destroyed the
Phoenix Foundation yet again.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.356
Maybe it's time to consider
letting sleeping bombs lie.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.793
I mean, if we don't move it,

24:06.836 --> 24:08.359
at least there's a chance
it won't go off.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.013
I did not make
my considerable fortune

24:10.057 --> 24:11.450
by playing it safe. I earned

24:11.493 --> 24:13.887
every cent
with one mantra.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.455
There is always a solution.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.065
Well, I didn't get to where I am

24:18.108 --> 24:19.719
letting people
second-guess my value.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.808
Yes, well, the bar for covert
operatives is slightly higher

24:21.851 --> 24:23.505
than short order cooks,
team mascots,

24:23.549 --> 24:24.767
definitely indie filmmakers,

24:24.811 --> 24:26.421
or...
Delivery man.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.901
What?

24:27.944 --> 24:30.033
I also used to deliver
appliances for a big box store.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.296
There was this thing
my boss Carl gave us to lift

24:32.340 --> 24:34.124
the refrigerators
and dishwashers up the stairs

24:34.168 --> 24:35.822
to apartments without elevators,

24:35.865 --> 24:38.520
so he didn't need to spend
the cash to hire a third guy.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.740
Hated that thing.
Well, we need that thing.

24:40.783 --> 24:44.091
My good man,
I know what Mac needs to build.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.050
That thing

24:47.094 --> 24:49.531
is actually called
a tri-star stair climber

24:49.575 --> 24:52.403
Used by most reputable
appliance delivery companies,

24:52.447 --> 24:55.015
but mine will be built using
rubber elevator wheels,

24:55.058 --> 24:58.409
metal plates, and a pair
of wireless power drills

24:58.453 --> 25:01.282
for a little extra "oomph."

25:05.895 --> 25:08.768
You know I didn't mean
what I said earlier, right?

25:08.811 --> 25:11.074
Obviously, we don't
just work together.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.249
Yeah, I know.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.991
And, uh, you deserve
your privacy.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.646
I just was
surprised.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.909
We all used to talk
about everything.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.216
Things have definitely been
different since we've been back.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.657
I'm such an idiot. I didn't
even ask what his name is.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.921
Oh. It's Aubrey.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.575
Aubrey?

25:33.619 --> 25:35.577
What kind of name
is that?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.274
Okay, Angus.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.276
That's-- okay-- fair.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.542
Does Aubrey
know about the Phoenix?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.283
If you mean
the think tank thing, yeah.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.418
Had to call him
from the plane

25:50.461 --> 25:51.680
and cancel dinner last minute.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.117
Told him I had a meeting
out of town.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.467
Can't be easy keeping
your story straight.

25:56.511 --> 25:59.601
When Aubrey and I
got together,

25:59.645 --> 26:02.125
I thought the top secret part
of my life was over.

26:02.169 --> 26:05.346
Then Russ showed up
and got the gang back together.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.695
Truth is,

26:06.739 --> 26:08.871
reason I haven't
told you guys about him

26:08.915 --> 26:11.004
is 'cause I knew
if I did, it'd be over.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.876
Phoenix and relationships
don't mix.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.618
That's funny, Desi and I
had the opposite problem.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.489
You don't have to tell me, Mac.
It's all right.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.795
Once the dust settled,

26:19.839 --> 26:22.624
I just realized
we weren't right for each other.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.714
Both clinging on
to something familiar

26:25.758 --> 26:28.456
to fill the void left
after the Phoenix shut down.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.631
It's, uh...

26:29.675 --> 26:31.198
You know...

26:31.241 --> 26:33.809
If I'm telling the truth,
living normal lives,

26:33.853 --> 26:36.203
we mostly just
got on each other's nerves.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.511
You think this job
screwed us up so bad

26:40.555 --> 26:42.688
we can never have normal,
healthy relationships?

26:54.700 --> 26:56.702
Mac!
Riley!

26:59.052 --> 27:00.836
Riley!

27:14.937 --> 27:17.374
Oh, my God.

27:17.418 --> 27:20.334
Oh, my God.

27:20.377 --> 27:23.380
Well, that was insane. You okay?
Yeah.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.777
And we're not dead,
so that's a win.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.344
Guys, I'm hearing
from search and rescue

27:30.387 --> 27:31.780
that the building
just shifted.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.217
Understatement of the century.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.697
Yeah, but the bomb
just rolled back

27:35.741 --> 27:37.612
half the distance we covered,
but it didn't explode,

27:37.656 --> 27:38.918
so that's nice.

27:38.961 --> 27:42.225
Helen, are you there?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.879
Helen?

27:43.923 --> 27:47.491
Matty, I lost contact
with Helen.

27:49.145 --> 27:52.714
You hear that?
Why is the bomb hissing at us?

27:57.937 --> 28:01.636
The acetone capsule broke.
The bomb is going to go off.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.120
Guys, crane's here.
What's your status?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.165
I'm still looking for Helen.
I can't get her on the radio.

28:09.209 --> 28:13.213
Helen!

28:13.256 --> 28:15.215
Okay, we finally
made it

28:15.258 --> 28:16.782
to the sixth floor.
We probably have

28:16.825 --> 28:18.305
about 40 minutes
before the bomb explodes.

28:18.348 --> 28:21.482
Good news, though, now that
the acetone capsule broke,

28:21.525 --> 28:23.440
we don't have to worry
about it breaking

28:23.484 --> 28:25.268
and we can move
much faster.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.661
Talk about looking
on the bright side.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.358
On this op, I'll take
anything I can get.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.926
Helen!

28:30.970 --> 28:33.537
Helen, can you hear me?

28:33.581 --> 28:36.758
Helen!

28:45.201 --> 28:46.942
Oh, Helen, you're brilliant.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.727
Right, it's too late

28:48.770 --> 28:50.816
for the bomb to be
driven out of the city,

28:50.859 --> 28:53.166
but it can still be submerged
in the Rhine river,

28:53.209 --> 28:54.994
which is only a mile away
from your location,

28:55.037 --> 28:56.822
and detonated
safely.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.693
Just make sure that
you're both at the edge

28:58.737 --> 29:00.173
of the sixth floor
with enough time

29:00.216 --> 29:01.348
to secure it to the crane.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.393
Copy that. We should
be in good...

29:03.437 --> 29:06.788
shape.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.225
We got a problem, guys.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.227
How big of a problem?

29:11.271 --> 29:14.274
Oh, about ten feet.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.581
There's a section
of floor missing

29:17.625 --> 29:19.366
from the middle
of the hallway.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.889
It must've broken away
when the building shook.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.546
Desi, you've got 32 minutes.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.548
Start making your way out.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.245
I can't leave, not yet.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.522
Helen?

29:45.566 --> 29:47.307
Helen?
Yes!

30:13.550 --> 30:14.943
Desi?

30:30.176 --> 30:31.655
Uh-uh. I got the wheels.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.005
You keep looking
straight ahead.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.834
Eyes on the
prize, Mac.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.455
Desi?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.892
They're on.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.807
Helen.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.505
There are some people
that want to talk to you.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.857
Hello?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.728
Mama? Mama?

31:03.078 --> 31:04.514
Robert.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.573
All right, Matty, we made it.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.140
We're at the edge
of the sixth floor.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.924
Okay. That's great news.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.926
Once the crane moves
into position,

31:24.970 --> 31:27.842
secure the bomb
and get the hell out of there.

31:32.803 --> 31:35.981
Earlier you were asking me
if I thought that...

31:36.024 --> 31:39.985
somebody could have this job and
maintain a healthy relationship.

31:40.028 --> 31:43.031
Here's something I
never told anybody.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.251
When we're on a mission

31:45.294 --> 31:49.385
and I'm about to do
something really stupid...

31:50.734 --> 31:53.172
...I imagine it all going wrong,

31:53.215 --> 31:55.652
and I see myself die.

31:55.696 --> 31:58.003
Every time.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.830
I can't help it.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.357
But...

32:04.400 --> 32:07.055
every time I just regret
that I'm alone.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.066
What?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.155
What's going on

32:20.199 --> 32:21.852
down there, Matty?
Search and rescue says

32:21.896 --> 32:24.855
one of the crane's hydraulic
lines was punctured by debris.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.901
It's out of fluid.
Well, that's not good.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.685
No, it's not, because now
it can't reach the bomb.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.992
Our plan was doomed
from the start.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.689
How many people are
still trapped in the building?

32:32.733 --> 32:34.996
Four. But none of them
can be moved,

32:35.040 --> 32:36.519
at least not in time.

32:36.563 --> 32:39.174
Desi, you've got
less than 26 minutes

32:39.218 --> 32:40.697
to get out of there.
She's pinned,

32:40.741 --> 32:42.395
and I'm not leaving.

32:43.396 --> 32:46.007
Desi, when that bomb goes off,

32:46.051 --> 32:48.444
it's taking everyone
in the building down with it.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.361
I know that.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.102
There's no reason
that you should be one of them.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.408
I'm not leaving, Mac.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.760
It's up to you now.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.111
Okay,
we need a Plan B.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.598
All we have to do is get
the bomb down to the ground.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.253
Then that truck
can drive her to the river.
Well, yeah,

33:14.296 --> 33:16.690
sure, but we don't know
how to do that first part.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.344
We might.

33:18.387 --> 33:19.998
Remember when that kid
at the scouts retreat asked

33:20.041 --> 33:21.782
why he had to learn
all the boring science stuff?

33:21.825 --> 33:23.392
Yeah.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.790
Oh.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.793
All we have to do is decrease
the impact force, right?

33:32.836 --> 33:33.794
What kid?

33:33.837 --> 33:35.317
It's all about the impact force.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.058
What's impact force?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.755
We're gonna
egg drop the bomb

33:38.799 --> 33:40.366
off the side of
the building.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.890
What? No, no, no, no.
That's a bonkers idea.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.718
That's a bonkers
idea, right?
100%

33:44.761 --> 33:46.067
what he said.
Could that even work?

33:46.111 --> 33:47.068
I mean, yeah, the physics

33:47.112 --> 33:48.374
are the same as
what's taught

33:48.417 --> 33:50.071
to every middle school
kid around the world,

33:50.115 --> 33:51.986
just on a slightly
larger scale.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.553
Mac, wouldn't a fall
from that height

33:53.596 --> 33:55.816
risk breaking what's left
of the celluloid discs,

33:55.859 --> 33:58.079
which could prematurely detonate
the bomb?

33:58.123 --> 33:59.428
In a word...

33:59.472 --> 34:00.821
yes, but..

34:00.864 --> 34:03.606
this thing fell 8,000 feet
and didn't blow up.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.304
What's 60 more?

34:12.833 --> 34:15.313
I'm telling you,
we need to increase tension

34:15.357 --> 34:16.532
on the bungee cords.

34:16.576 --> 34:17.967
We already tried that.
Then we need

34:18.012 --> 34:19.795
to increase
it more.
Angus,

34:19.840 --> 34:21.755
your egg drop design has leveled
the Phoenix Foundation

34:21.797 --> 34:24.105
43% of the time
we've tossed it off the roof.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.107
If you push yours off the side
of the building, it's basically

34:26.150 --> 34:28.891
flipping a coin to see
if you'll be incinerated or not.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.591
Yeah, well, that still gives
Desi and Helen a 57% better shot

34:31.634 --> 34:33.245
at surviving
than if we walk away.

34:34.463 --> 34:35.681
Well, we...

34:35.725 --> 34:37.639
we could try increasing
the, uh, the tension

34:37.684 --> 34:39.989
on the bungee cord here.
No. We only have 20 minutes.

34:40.034 --> 34:43.342
The benefit of improving
the design doesn't outweigh

34:43.385 --> 34:45.474
the risk of running out
the clock. It's go time.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.043
Riley.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.610
Count of three.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.045
One.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.356
Two.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.811
Three!

35:37.309 --> 35:39.267
It didn't explode.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.189
We're still alive.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.800
What?

35:53.586 --> 35:55.805
Hey, Mac.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.288
You're never alone, all right?

36:00.332 --> 36:01.507
You neither, Riley.

36:02.986 --> 36:05.206
And you definitely earned
your science badge today.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.579
You're home.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.854
I was trying not to wake you.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.596
I figured you'd be starving,
so I put last night's dinner

36:47.640 --> 36:49.119
back in the oven.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.208
Mm-hmm.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.557
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.254
How was
San Francisco?

36:54.777 --> 36:57.171
I've already forgotten.
Hmm.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.271
So...

37:10.315 --> 37:14.623
Mac, Riley and Desi are back
home, safe and sound, and...

37:14.667 --> 37:17.670
Helen is with her family
at the hospital.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.803
Good news.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.415
Yes. You, uh...

37:23.458 --> 37:25.460
you did well today.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.420
My good man.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.073
You weren't so
bad yourself,

37:30.117 --> 37:31.249
old chap.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.250
Please.
Please, sir...

37:32.293 --> 37:33.512
Okay.
Stop.

37:33.555 --> 37:36.036
Okay.
So, I've figured out

37:36.079 --> 37:37.516
what it is you do here.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.520
I mean, good.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.566
But if you could,
you know, like...

37:44.610 --> 37:47.308
tell me, that...
that'd be cool,
too, to-to know.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.484
Little bit of this,
little bit of that.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.834
Jack-of-all-trades.
Ah.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.228
But a master of none.
No.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.319
A master of more
than one would imagine.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.804
Apologies for before.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.153
No worries, man.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.546
I'm sorry for...

38:07.589 --> 38:09.896
considering
shutting down your lab.
All good.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.724
Wait, what?
And my regrets
for putting

38:11.767 --> 38:13.682
old what's-his-face, Sparky,
on eBay.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.859
Good news, though,
is that he's up to $200.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.687
Huh?!

38:20.341 --> 38:22.822
No, no, no. What
the hell, man?

38:29.568 --> 38:32.048
I found this photo in documents

38:32.092 --> 38:35.051
in the Office of Scientific
Research and Development.

38:35.095 --> 38:38.403
The man at the back far left
is Dr. Zachary Tutelman.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.492
He's the designer

38:40.535 --> 38:42.624
of the time-delay bomb fuse.
And the others?

38:42.668 --> 38:43.930
Um, I don't know yet.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.627
But take a look at the clipboard

38:45.671 --> 38:47.325
that the man in the suit
is holding.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.894
It's them.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.635
That's the symbol
of the group

38:53.679 --> 38:55.420
we've been looking for--
the organization

38:55.463 --> 38:57.247
behind the L.A. water
supply, the NORAD attack.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.423
Mm.
But I don't
understand how.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.512
This is from the 1940s.
Whoever they are,

39:00.555 --> 39:03.428
they've been around a lot longer
than we first thought.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.733
But that's not all.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.083
I did some more
digging, and...

39:09.259 --> 39:11.305
...I think I know what
they call themselves.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.962
the day for which free people

39:16.005 --> 39:19.313
long have waited--
this is D-Day.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.642
You're not allowed to be in here
without clearance.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.950
I know that you have
reservations about the...

39:47.994 --> 39:51.171
goodness of this endeavor.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.000
There are others
who think as you do,

39:54.043 --> 39:56.437
fellow innovators
who hope that science

39:56.481 --> 39:58.787
will make the world
a better place,

39:58.831 --> 40:00.615
but fear that it
might end it.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.098
I'm here to tell
you one thing:

40:05.141 --> 40:07.796
there is a way for you
to continue your work

40:07.840 --> 40:09.145
and find peace.

40:09.189 --> 40:11.800
You just have
to be shown a...

40:11.844 --> 40:14.020
different perspective.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.198
Consider it.
