00:34.500 --> 00:36.480
I can't carelessly approach him
like this.

00:45.531 --> 00:48.632
What intense heat and flames.

00:53.973 --> 00:55.179
One and a half minutes left.

00:55.258 --> 00:56.214
Yes.

00:56.816 --> 00:58.539
Die, Grandma!

01:09.397 --> 01:11.354
Eat this!

01:12.839 --> 01:13.703
Naive!

01:20.961 --> 01:22.000
Just as I thought.

01:22.646 --> 01:26.039
You attached a Chakra thread
in the middle of that fight, huh?

01:41.815 --> 01:45.203
But the same trick won't work twice!

01:46.219 --> 01:47.859
How unfortunate.

01:55.443 --> 01:56.968
There's no time...

03:27.571 --> 03:32.541
Puppet Fight: 10 vs. 100!

03:36.524 --> 03:38.406
What's the matter...?
Aren't you going to attack?

03:45.013 --> 03:47.223
The effects of the antidote
will last one more minute...

03:49.085 --> 03:49.758
Then...

03:54.366 --> 03:54.929
Water?

03:55.281 --> 03:56.898
Sakura! Get away!

04:20.173 --> 04:20.976
There!

04:33.306 --> 04:35.570
How long do you intend
to run about?

04:41.232 --> 04:42.406
Twenty seconds left.

04:44.232 --> 04:45.640
If that's how it's going to be...

05:03.925 --> 05:05.297
Fifteen seconds...left...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.249
Are you okay, Sakura?!

05:12.745 --> 05:13.745
Die!

05:18.433 --> 05:19.413
Granny Chiyo!

05:28.296 --> 05:29.827
The antidote is working!

05:30.790 --> 05:32.786
If I can just endure the pain...

05:40.705 --> 05:42.078
Your efforts are futile.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.054
Five seconds left!

05:50.635 --> 05:51.258
Four seconds.

05:53.058 --> 05:54.562
You--!!

06:00.020 --> 06:01.007
Sakura?!

06:01.622 --> 06:03.820
Eat this!

06:05.447 --> 06:06.148
Three seconds.

06:08.761 --> 06:09.334
Two!

06:20.707 --> 06:23.140
(Scorpion)

06:37.452 --> 06:38.696
We were able...

06:38.856 --> 06:41.531
to beat him exactly within 
antidote duration limit...

06:50.101 --> 06:51.219
We did it.

06:51.735 --> 06:52.882
Granny Chiyo...

06:53.992 --> 06:54.835
We just did it!

06:56.013 --> 06:57.003
Sakura...

06:58.007 --> 06:58.961
You...

07:11.733 --> 07:15.351
That kid...has totally calmed down...

07:15.677 --> 07:17.062
What's he planning?

07:25.264 --> 07:26.163
Kakashi Sensei!

07:26.585 --> 07:27.414
Aren't you ready yet?!

07:27.931 --> 07:29.484
Don't be so hasty

07:31.236 --> 07:33.906
I don't have as much Chakra
as you, after all...

07:35.345 --> 07:36.867
It's going to take time.

08:02.271 --> 08:04.867
(Scorpion)

08:36.543 --> 08:38.383
What did you do?

08:42.472 --> 08:44.455
That's right.

08:56.299 --> 08:58.539
The fight is just beginning.

09:03.948 --> 09:06.297
This is a Jutsu I myself sealed...

09:09.043 --> 09:12.687
I didn't think I'd ever use it again...

09:14.007 --> 09:16.289
But it seems it won't work out
that way.

09:18.507 --> 09:20.953
Now let's put an end to this.

09:48.251 --> 09:54.711
It's said the ability of a puppet master is measured
 by the number of puppets they can use...

09:55.156 --> 09:56.719
I'd expect no less from you, Grandma.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.671
Th-There's so many...

10:00.230 --> 10:01.207
Ten of them.

10:01.671 --> 10:04.611
Granny Chiyo's secret
"Number of Fingers."

10:05.074 --> 10:06.883
I'd heard rumors about it...

10:08.313 --> 10:12.280
The device you used to bring down
a castle by yourself...

10:12.860 --> 10:15.853
The Secret White Move:
Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets.

10:16.592 --> 10:19.492
Made by the first Puppeteer 
of the Puppet Master Jutsu...

10:19.648 --> 10:21.554
The Monzaemon's ten masterpieces...

10:22.227 --> 10:23.921
That's a impressive collection of puppets.

10:26.205 --> 10:27.273
However...

10:54.065 --> 10:54.773
I...

10:55.290 --> 10:58.508
used this to bring down a nation!

11:13.118 --> 11:15.883
He has... achieved such level...

11:18.269 --> 11:20.008
I'm appalled at myself.

11:20.994 --> 11:24.367
How long am I going to have to fight
a little girl and an old bag...?

11:27.279 --> 11:31.265
I never thought I'd have to
bring out my final device...

11:39.543 --> 11:41.812
Secret Red Move: Performance
of a Hundred Puppets...

11:42.440 --> 11:44.640
I'll show you...

11:52.264 --> 11:53.244
Sakura...

11:54.453 --> 11:57.433
The effects of
your antidote have worn off.

11:57.811 --> 11:58.794
Stay out of this.

12:06.422 --> 12:08.030
You should already realized...

12:09.765 --> 12:11.178
My personality!

12:20.873 --> 12:21.876
That's right...

12:22.583 --> 12:25.553
You've inherited
Tsunade's personality as well.

12:30.476 --> 12:33.836
But let's make this the final act.

12:34.456 --> 12:35.680
Are you ready?

12:36.093 --> 12:36.906
Yes!

12:40.181 --> 12:41.430
Here he comes!

13:54.811 --> 13:57.345
Three Treasures Suction Crush!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.627
As expected from this amount...

14:18.540 --> 14:21.690
The surefire way to lessen the number is to
 fight them one-on-one somehow...

14:33.655 --> 14:34.612
All right!

14:46.443 --> 14:47.948
There are too many of them!

15:25.002 --> 15:26.453
Are you okay, Sakura?!

15:26.766 --> 15:27.749
I'm okay!

15:28.141 --> 15:29.398
Stay sharp!

15:29.510 --> 15:30.211
Right!

15:31.603 --> 15:34.583
There definitely aren't
as many of Sasori's puppets now...

15:35.050 --> 15:35.734
However...

15:35.790 --> 15:41.109
it looks like he's concentrating
more on each puppet now.

15:41.757 --> 15:44.664
And on top of that,
we only have one antidote left.

15:45.010 --> 15:49.508
Things will get tough in a hurry
if either Sakura or I get wounded.

15:54.943 --> 15:56.187
Granny Chiyo!

15:56.429 --> 15:57.609
Oh no...!

16:06.768 --> 16:08.728
Are you okay, Granny Chiyo?

16:09.424 --> 16:11.747
You don't need to worry about me!

16:12.136 --> 16:14.575
More importantly, aim for Sasori.

16:15.443 --> 16:17.810
I'll keep the other puppets in check!

16:18.637 --> 16:19.356
Right!

16:40.090 --> 16:42.053
Sakura, use that!

17:34.216 --> 17:35.324
Here!

18:38.624 --> 18:39.597
We did it!

18:45.816 --> 18:47.010
You can't move.

18:47.325 --> 18:51.535
That seal completely
suppresses all Chakra.

18:51.941 --> 18:54.473
You can't use
your Chakra threads anymore.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.996
It's over, Sasori...

18:59.898 --> 19:00.652
Granny Chiyo!

19:01.064 --> 19:02.301
Use the antidote quickly!

21:37.570 --> 21:39.576
She was quick-witted
from the very beginning...

21:39.894 --> 21:41.850
And she was super cute...

21:41.884 --> 21:45.890
She was way too beautiful!
She was my youth!

21:46.003 --> 21:48.000
Despite her character,
she had her good points...

21:48.213 --> 21:48.774
You're right...

21:48.819 --> 21:50.799
To think she'd pass away
so soon like this...

21:50.899 --> 21:52.869
Lee, cry into my arms!

21:52.902 --> 21:54.353
Guy Sensei!

21:54.432 --> 21:56.407
Please watch over us...

21:56.612 --> 22:00.962
I'll never forget about you, Sakura--!

22:01.194 --> 22:03.187
Cut it out, all of you!
This is discouraging!

22:03.428 --> 22:06.375
Next time:
"Impossible Dream"
