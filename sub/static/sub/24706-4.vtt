All of a sudden, he just--
He just kicked off.

04:22.173 --> 04:24.812

06:59.893 --> 07:03.408
That's great.

08:10.093 --> 08:12.004
Can't they do that downtown?

08:12.173 --> 08:15.245
They said the interviewees
live in the precinct.

08:15.853 --> 08:18.128
Where are you on that child homicide?

08:18.293 --> 08:20.568
The mother's boyfriend

He said it was a drive-by.
l haven't been able to locate her yet. . .

-Get him.

08:29.693 --> 08:34.687
They're doing this here
to embarrass me.

How long you live at the hotel, Duane?

08:51.853 --> 08:53.764
DUANE:
Couple of weeks.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.332
Where'd you live before that?

We are gonna need more help

-And she left the child with you?

09:03.773 --> 09:05.206
What was the friend's name?

09:05.413 --> 09:07.005
She never said.

09:07.973 --> 09:09.725
Never mentioned the friend's name?

09:11.173 --> 09:13.129
l don't remember.

09:13.293 --> 09:15.887
Her being out all night,
weren't you worried about Sandy?

09:16.053 --> 09:17.281
DUANE:
Yeah, l was worried.

09:17.813 --> 09:20.805
l was driving around looking
for her when Tiffany got shot.

09:21.813 --> 09:23.883
Sandy work someplace?

09:24.053 --> 09:26.442
She's looking for work.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.121
John, you got a second?

09:33.693 --> 09:36.253
-What's up?
-This is Duane's rap sheet.

09:36.413 --> 09:38.688
Sandy Rowe got popped
for prostitution last night.

09:38.853 --> 09:41.526
She's being arraigned this morning
on Centre Street.

09:41.693 --> 09:44.491
-Let me take care of him, we'll get her.
-Okay.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.333
MEDAVO Y:
Are you working Duane?

09:47.533 --> 09:51.082
DUANE: We've both been looking.
We haven't been in town very long.

09:51.253 --> 09:55.326
MEDAVO Y: You came in from where?
-Baltimore.

09:55.493 --> 09:59.088
But you used to live here.

10:00.253 --> 10:01.481

10:02.293 --> 10:07.765
Well, burglary, assault,
possession of cocaine.

10:07.933 --> 10:10.367
DUANE:
You guys are really something.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.922
l get used for target practice,
and l'm the criminal.

10:13.093 --> 10:15.971
KELLY: l don't think this is random.
-What do you call it?

10:16.173 --> 10:17.652
l think you know these people.

10:17.853 --> 10:21.641
They chased you in traffic,
in and out, for two blocks.

10:21.813 --> 10:24.088
What, is this fun for you guys?

10:24.253 --> 10:27.245
l'm broken up about this kid,
and you just wanna harass my ass.

10:27.413 --> 10:30.132
l don't care what else you're into, okay?

10:30.293 --> 10:32.170
But you know these people.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.370
They chased you,
and they shot an 1 8-month-old girl.

10:35.573 --> 10:37.245
So l want you to give them up.

10:37.413 --> 10:39.802
l got nothing to tell you
because l don't know them.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.441
l don't know why they picked us.

10:42.613 --> 10:45.002
We just picked up Sandy
for prostitution.

10:45.533 --> 10:48.605
We're going down to Centre Street
to pick her up now.

10:48.773 --> 10:53.801
While l'm there, l want you to sit here
and think about your little scenario. . .

10:54.013 --> 10:56.129

SlPOWlCZ: Hey, Howie, l gotta

11:19.413 --> 11:21.005

Don't be sorry. Remedy your faults.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.524
And l gotta do it again. l gotta leave.

-What the hell is going on with you?
-ln general or right now?

11:55.053 --> 11:58.090
BREEN: Three telephone conversations

11:58.253 --> 12:00.289
That's what l wanted

12:00.453 --> 12:03.286
-You say you've been going to meetings.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.444

in detail at a time of early convenience.

12:30.693 --> 12:33.526
-What kind of advancement?
-Uh. . . .

12:33.813 --> 12:36.691
We're talking about living together.

12:37.413 --> 12:39.722
You were okayed to have dinner
with her.

12:39.933 --> 12:43.448
-This is why l wanted to talk to you.
-And now you're cohabiting!

12:43.653 --> 12:45.609

12:45.773 --> 12:50.369
You are a classic drunk.
You can't stay inside boundaries.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.172
You walk in for dinner.
You walk out, you're shacked up.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.890

to marry you.

13:00.493 --> 13:03.053
l gotta go. l'll talk to you later.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.131
Hey! Hey! Get away from the car.

13:18.413 --> 13:21.325
-What's wrong with him?
-Nothing. He's drunk like you. Get lost.

13:21.493 --> 13:24.530
-That man looks dead.
-Will you get lost?

13:24.733 --> 13:28.362
What'd you do to him? Hey, y'all,

13:28.573 --> 13:30.768

-Yeah, you a cop.

-Who'd you piss off?
-What did lAB want?

14:07.933 --> 14:10.527
To talk about when you got me money
after Nicky was shot.

14:10.693 --> 14:13.491
l got you that money
so you could get out of town, right?

14:14.453 --> 14:18.082
They wanted to know were you getting
sex from me, is that why l got money.

14:18.253 --> 14:20.084
You told them the truth though, right?

14:20.253 --> 14:21.845
-l'm not feeling so good.
-Kimmy.

14:22.053 --> 14:24.248
Kimmy, you told them
the truth though, right?

14:24.813 --> 14:26.405
Yeah.

14:26.573 --> 14:29.007
Yeah, l said it wasn't like that.

14:29.173 --> 14:32.245
l kind of got the feeling
that was the B answer.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
How was Florida?

14:34.453 --> 14:37.570
l was gonna go, you know, but l--

14:37.733 --> 14:39.803
l kind of got into some behavior.

14:39.973 --> 14:41.611
Okay.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.570
Take care of yourself, okay?

14:45.293 --> 14:46.885
You too.

14:54.853 --> 14:58.243
-How old are you, Sandy?
-Nineteen.

14:58.413 --> 15:03.612
Do you know if Tiffany said anything?
lf she was alive at all afterward?

15:03.773 --> 15:06.207
l think she died right away.

15:10.973 --> 15:13.248
KELLY:
l know this is painful for you, Sandy.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.883
But l've gotta ask you a few questions,
and it's important you're honest.

15:17.093 --> 15:18.890
-l understand.
KELLY: All right.

15:19.053 --> 15:20.452
Now was anybody after Duane. . .

15:20.613 --> 15:22.808
-. . .that you know about?
-No.

15:23.013 --> 15:24.332
Nobody he had run-ins with. . .

15:24.493 --> 15:27.291
-. . .that you know about?
-No.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.563
How long you two been together?

15:29.733 --> 15:32.406
About six months, l guess.

15:32.613 --> 15:34.285
How long you been turning tricks?

15:34.853 --> 15:40.564
Couple months. Not every day though.
l just been going out once in a while.

15:40.733 --> 15:44.692
lt sounds to me like he has a drug habit,
and that's why he's got you out there.

15:44.893 --> 15:47.043
He doesn't use drugs.

15:47.893 --> 15:50.123
l'm not here trying to bust him for that.

15:50.293 --> 15:52.727
Tiffany was in the car with him
when she got shot. . .

15:52.893 --> 15:55.123
. . .and we wanna catch the people
who did this.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.368
l don't know anything.

15:56.533 --> 15:58.888
Are you scared of him, Sandy?
We can protect you.

15:59.093 --> 16:02.802
-You'll think about this for life.
-l'm thinking of her every second now.

16:02.973 --> 16:05.362
Do you wanna always remember
you didn't do anything?

16:05.573 --> 16:09.248
l don't know anything.
He never talked to me about business.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.001
Was Duane dealing?

16:13.773 --> 16:16.765
Look. Look, l just wanna look
at my little girl, okay?

16:16.933 --> 16:20.005
l just wanna see my baby.

16:21.973 --> 16:24.407
Take her over to 30th Street, James.

16:24.573 --> 16:26.803
Okay.

16:26.973 --> 16:29.009
Come on, Sandy.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.364
SlPOWlCZ: Greg, come here.
-Hey, Andy.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.286
Hey, come here,
l wanna talk to you a minute.

16:54.453 --> 16:57.968
Boy, that Cuban-American place
is getting really popular for lunch.

16:58.133 --> 16:59.486
l was there for lunch today--

16:59.693 --> 17:01.968
SlPOWlCZ: Can you help me?
-Yeah, what's up?

17:02.133 --> 17:04.965
Come here. l wanna ask you something.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.044
Get in the car here.
We gotta go someplace.

17:07.213 --> 17:09.363
MEDAVO Y:
Well, that's Howie Hornbeck's car.

17:09.532 --> 17:10.521
SlPOWlCZ:
l know.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.046
-Where's Howie?
-He's a couple of blocks away in my car.

17:15.213 --> 17:17.727
We're gonna drive there,
then you'll drive my car back.

17:17.933 --> 17:21.561
-And then you'll ride back with Howie?
-Yeah. Would you please get in the car?

17:21.733 --> 17:23.325
Did your car go dead?

17:23.492 --> 17:26.007
No, Medavoy. Howie's dead in my car.

17:26.173 --> 17:29.449
Now l wanna move him into his car
but not in front of the station.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.081
Would you please just get in the car?

17:32.253 --> 17:33.368
Howie's dead?

17:33.573 --> 17:35.211
Medavoy, get in the car!

17:52.733 --> 17:54.564
Let's put him in the passenger seat. . .

17:54.733 --> 17:57.201
. . .and when we get to the station,
we'll slide him over.

17:57.373 --> 17:59.091
MEDAVO Y:
How many laws are we breaking?

17:59.293 --> 18:03.411
What do you want me to do, Medavoy?
Have him get found with a $40 hooker?

18:03.573 --> 18:07.088
-All right, here, l'll get the feet.
-l'll take the top. Here we go.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.572
MEDAVO Y: On three.
-Yeah.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.610
MEDAVO Y:
One, two, three.

18:10.773 --> 18:12.331
SlPOWlCZ: Got him?
-l got him, yeah.

18:12.493 --> 18:14.961
SlPOWlCZ:
Okay, okay. All right.

18:16.293 --> 18:17.521
[FARTlNG ]

18:17.693 --> 18:21.447
-Oh, jeez.
-Oh, man, Howie.

18:22.213 --> 18:26.650
All right, let me get the feet in first.
l gotta get his feet in.

18:27.173 --> 18:31.246
There. Oh, man, he's got me
all tangled up.

18:31.733 --> 18:34.930
Okay, good. Good.

18:35.093 --> 18:36.970
All right. Now slide him over.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.361
MEDAVO Y:
Why?

18:38.573 --> 18:41.246
So l can grab his collar.
Otherwise, l step on the brake. . .

18:41.413 --> 18:43.643
. . .he smashes his head
on the dashboard.

18:47.013 --> 18:49.288
That's good.

18:49.493 --> 18:51.529
Here's my keys.

18:52.933 --> 18:55.845
Hey, Andy, something's not right.

18:56.253 --> 18:58.130
-What?
-Did you button these buttons?

18:59.333 --> 19:01.449
l was in a hurry.

19:04.773 --> 19:07.492
MAN:
That smells really nice.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.611
-There, that's better.
-All right, close the door.

19:11.813 --> 19:13.963
Does your car have
any special handling traits?

19:15.573 --> 19:16.892
No.

19:17.213 --> 19:20.569
LESNlAK: Jimmy, listen--
Because you need to see a doctor.

19:21.853 --> 19:24.765
Because you need treatment, Jimmy.

19:26.653 --> 19:28.371
Why?

19:28.533 --> 19:31.923
You say they're gonna find me
in a pool of blood?

19:34.373 --> 19:37.092
Our lives are not over.

19:37.253 --> 19:40.131
We should go on with our new lives.

19:40.813 --> 19:45.170
Please, let me do that.
Do it for yourself.

19:46.133 --> 19:49.682
You stop this.
l'm asking you for a last time.

19:49.853 --> 19:53.448
l'm hanging up. l'm hanging up, Jimmy.

19:53.613 --> 19:58.892
Oh, God, please, leave me alone.

20:18.773 --> 20:20.684
Miss Hypersensitive.

20:20.893 --> 20:24.090
-l thought you were on night tour.
GOTELLl: l just finished in court.

20:24.253 --> 20:26.084
Yeah, well, leave me alone.

20:26.253 --> 20:28.483
ls someone about to get the curse?

20:28.653 --> 20:30.052
Oh, Gotelli.

20:30.213 --> 20:35.287
You know, l was gonna get Band-Aids
for this, but l didn't have the time.

20:57.133 --> 20:59.328
Sit down.

21:00.533 --> 21:02.569
Sit down, Duane.

21:03.493 --> 21:05.927
When am l getting released?

21:06.973 --> 21:08.133
l don't know.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.088
l don't know.

21:09.253 --> 21:12.928
Look, l didn't see them.
l don't know them. What can l do?

21:13.133 --> 21:16.409
lf you were in the middle
of a criminal act, say drug dealing. . .

21:16.573 --> 21:18.723
. . .when this child got killed
in your car. . .

21:18.933 --> 21:22.005
. . .in the eyes of the law,
that's like pulling the trigger.

21:22.173 --> 21:24.448
What's that bitch telling you
l'm dealing?

21:24.613 --> 21:27.446
-She's crazy. She's out of her mind.
-You got a crack problem.

21:27.613 --> 21:31.606
Yeah, that's a crock too. But l'm handy.
Pin something on me.

21:32.773 --> 21:36.766
KELLY: Here's the other thing.
These guys that are after you. . .

21:36.933 --> 21:40.289
. . .are not gonna let up
after what you witnessed this morning.

21:40.493 --> 21:42.961
Hey, you're not slick enough
for this work.

21:43.133 --> 21:45.328
l'm not dealing anything,
and nobody's after me.

21:45.493 --> 21:47.768
You believed everything
that crazy bitch told you.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.533
She lost her child this morning.
You owe her respect.

21:50.693 --> 21:55.403
-What about me? Where's my respect?
-Be a man, and you'll get your respect.

21:55.573 --> 21:57.928
The kid was killed in your car.
You're responsible.

21:58.093 --> 22:01.722
So l want you to take responsibility
for it and give me these guys.

22:01.933 --> 22:04.652
l don't owe anybody.
l've been jerked around my whole life.

22:04.813 --> 22:07.964
Nobody ever gave me one damn thing.
Go on, buck for your promotion.

22:08.533 --> 22:12.128
l've been stepped on by badder guys
than you'll see in your wildest dreams.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.252
l doubt that, Duane.

22:14.413 --> 22:17.086
No? l've been screwed by experts
since l was a kid.

22:17.293 --> 22:20.365
You wanna see a victim of child abuse?
You're looking at one.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.808
Locked in closets,
beat with a board, you name it.

22:22.973 --> 22:25.168
What do you know about what
l had to go through?

22:25.373 --> 22:28.365
-Sandy is out on the streets. . .
-She was hustling when l met her.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.683
. . .turning tricks, hooked on dope.

22:30.853 --> 22:33.083
Now her child has been killed.
That's your fault.

22:33.293 --> 22:36.205
Man, you're really simple.
l took her in off the streets.

22:36.373 --> 22:39.445
She'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
l'm not any kind of damn pimp.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.733
l tried to take her out of the life. She
sneaks off, turns a trick once in a while.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.530
l tried to take her out of the life. She
sneaks off, turns a trick once in a while.

22:43.733 --> 22:44.802
l did the best l could.

22:44.973 --> 22:48.045
l tried to be a father to that kid,
but l can't control everything.

22:48.213 --> 22:51.091
-You're a liar, Duane.
-Well, l don't care what you think.

22:51.293 --> 22:53.249
l can look myself in the mirror anytime.

22:53.453 --> 22:56.843
-What do you see?
-What do l see? l see a good guy.

23:00.293 --> 23:03.842
Okay, this is what we got.
You're not getting out of here.

23:04.053 --> 23:07.682
l'm not bucking for any promotion
because l'm about strung up on this job.

23:07.853 --> 23:11.892
So if l have to lock the doors
and pull the shades down in here. . .

23:12.053 --> 23:14.851
. . .to get what l want from you, l will.

23:15.053 --> 23:19.763
So l want these guys, got it?

23:57.893 --> 24:01.249
Poor little baby.

24:01.413 --> 24:04.644
There, there, there, huh?

24:33.173 --> 24:38.611
Sandy, in your daughter's memory,
l want you to cooperate with us.

24:43.133 --> 24:47.251
Some dealers let Duane have credit
on a quarter ounce. . .

24:48.173 --> 24:52.769
. . .because Duane had a buyer,
and the guy didn't show.

24:52.933 --> 24:55.493
And we did a lot of it.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.570
Duane tried to talk his way out of it. . .

25:01.013 --> 25:03.891
. . .but he told me they were
real pissed at him. . .

25:04.053 --> 25:07.045
. . .for not coming up with the money.

25:09.013 --> 25:12.085
-lt could've been them.
-Do you know their names?

25:15.133 --> 25:18.170
Tito was one.

25:19.053 --> 25:22.250
And l don't know their last names.

25:22.413 --> 25:25.007
Duane would have to tell you.

25:25.173 --> 25:30.452
Do you know what they look like, where
they deal out of? You ever seen them?

25:30.613 --> 25:32.649
No.

25:34.293 --> 25:36.966
l don't think so.

25:41.653 --> 25:45.441
Okay. Okay, we'll get it off of Duane.

25:46.093 --> 25:47.526
All right?

25:55.773 --> 25:59.163
-Sarge, Howie Hornbeck's dead.
-Where is he? What happened?

25:59.333 --> 26:01.483
ln the parking lot in his car.
He's stone dead.

26:01.933 --> 26:04.367
-Well, let me call EMS.
-He worked a night tour.

26:04.533 --> 26:07.252
-He must've been there all day.
-He had a heart attack, huh?

26:07.453 --> 26:09.284
-Yeah.
SERGEANT: This is the 1 5th Precinct.

26:09.453 --> 26:11.967
We need an ambulance here
to pronounce a DOA.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.691
What's up?

26:13.853 --> 26:15.764
Howie Hornbeck died.

26:15.973 --> 26:19.852
-Howie Hornbeck?
-Howie Hornbeck.

26:28.413 --> 26:31.052
How can l help myself?

26:31.253 --> 26:33.562
KELLY:
You done with this guy?

26:33.733 --> 26:36.008
-Yeah.
KELLY: See you, Tahir.

26:36.173 --> 26:39.245
-See you, detective.
KELLY: Let me ask you a question.

26:39.453 --> 26:42.365
You're using him to make a case
against a wrong cop, correct?

26:42.573 --> 26:45.326
-ls that the question?
-No, that's not the question.

26:45.493 --> 26:46.693
The question is, if you're dealing with
him down on Hudson Street. . .

26:46.693 --> 26:48.649
The question is, if you're dealing with
him down on Hudson Street. . .

26:48.813 --> 26:50.724
. . .all the time, why re-interview up here?

26:50.933 --> 26:53.766
lt's called obeying orders.
You ought to try it sometime.

26:53.933 --> 26:57.369
Your orders are to humiliate me
in my own house?

26:57.533 --> 27:00.923
-l gotta go.
-l want an answer from you right now.

27:01.093 --> 27:03.926
Go ahead, detective,
make another mistake.

27:04.093 --> 27:07.483
FANCY: Howie's space is next to mine.
l was parked right next to him.

27:07.653 --> 27:09.689
l must've walked right past
him this morning.

27:09.853 --> 27:12.321
l'm taking a membership out
at one of them gyms.

27:12.493 --> 27:14.802
-Hear about Howie Hornbeck?
-The night tour guy?

27:15.013 --> 27:17.686
SlPOWlCZ: l found him dead in his car.
-You're kidding me.

27:17.853 --> 27:21.084
FANCY: Looks like a heart attack.
MARTlNEZ: l'll be right with you.

27:21.253 --> 27:23.687
l don't think l'll be able to recognize
any pictures.

27:23.853 --> 27:26.208
Go ahead, we'll see how you do.

27:26.413 --> 27:29.132
-l just heard Howie died.
-Yeah, how're you doing with her?

27:29.333 --> 27:32.370
She gave up the boyfriend's dealing.
He had two guys mad at him.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.603
-Can she pick them out?
-She doesn't think so.

27:34.773 --> 27:38.049
All she had was the first name of one,
but l'll run some photos anyway.

27:38.213 --> 27:40.773
-What about the boyfriend?
KELLY: Said he didn't see.

27:40.933 --> 27:42.764
FANCY: Could he be telling the truth?
-No.

27:42.933 --> 27:44.810
HAVERlLL:
Lieutenant.

27:46.213 --> 27:48.568
-You got a minute?
-Yeah.

27:50.093 --> 27:52.243
Stay on him.

27:54.253 --> 27:58.132
-l gotta talk to the M.E.
KELLY: Okay.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.289
-What was that name she gave up?
-Sandy?

28:01.453 --> 28:03.171
-Yeah.
-Tito.

28:03.373 --> 28:06.809
-Tito. Stay on her.
-Okay.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.287
l gotta contact Hornbeck's family.

28:13.453 --> 28:15.728
This won't take long.

28:16.733 --> 28:19.486
Kelly's transferred to the borough.
He'll work dispatch.

28:19.653 --> 28:22.372
-lAB investigates him for a month.
-lAB's a separate matter.

28:22.533 --> 28:23.682
They come up with zilch.

28:23.893 --> 28:26.726
lAB's inquiry is separate,
and l understand it's not complete.

28:26.933 --> 28:29.606
-And you hang him out?
-He was borderline insubordinate.

28:29.773 --> 28:31.889
He stinks from that trial
and is reassigned.

28:32.093 --> 28:34.687
No, this stinks, captain.

28:34.853 --> 28:37.367
Let's you and me work
a signal out, okay, lieutenant?

28:37.573 --> 28:42.169
lf l'm here for your opinion on
something, l'll come in wearing a rose.

28:43.293 --> 28:45.443
Let the man know.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.483
DUANE:
Here come the Marines.

28:57.173 --> 28:59.129
Story of your life, Duane.

28:59.293 --> 29:02.410
-What is?
-ln too long, out too soon.

29:02.613 --> 29:05.525
l guess l'll be smart enough
when l file for brutality.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.161
For what? Nobody touched you. . .

29:08.333 --> 29:11.962
. . .and you could've walked out of here
with some cash in your pocket.

29:12.173 --> 29:14.209
Cash, huh?

29:14.733 --> 29:17.930
-How would that've worked?
-That's what l've been trying to tell you.

29:18.093 --> 29:20.926
We got a 2-year-old girl who's
been shot. We gotta clear that.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.004
We could've gone
into our pockets for you.

29:23.253 --> 29:26.165
But asshole that you are,
you made me wait.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.564
So l don't need you anymore.
l got another witness.

29:30.373 --> 29:32.807
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

29:33.013 --> 29:36.483
l don't think you have anything,
or you wouldn't be talking to me.

29:37.133 --> 29:39.442
l've got Tito.

29:43.293 --> 29:45.329
Tito rolled on his buddy. . .

29:45.493 --> 29:50.009
. . .and he got the deal
that you could've had.

29:50.173 --> 29:52.767
So l got something.

29:59.053 --> 30:01.726
ls there any money left?

30:08.733 --> 30:10.803
l'm gonna need full cooperation.

30:10.973 --> 30:14.807
l'm gonna need names,
places of business.

30:14.973 --> 30:19.364
And then l've gotta prove to the D.A.
you're not an asshole.

30:36.093 --> 30:38.527
SlPOWlCZ:
Looking for me?

30:38.693 --> 30:40.445
-Detective Sipowicz?
-Yeah.

30:40.613 --> 30:42.444
l understand you discovered the body.

30:42.653 --> 30:44.086
What was it, a heart attack?

30:44.253 --> 30:46.892
l think so. We'll verify on autopsy.

30:47.093 --> 30:49.288
But l'm concerned
about the body position.

30:49.453 --> 30:50.806
What do you mean?

30:50.973 --> 30:53.441
Lividity's all wrong
for the position he's in.

30:53.613 --> 30:54.853
Well, l moved him a little.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.569
Well, l moved him a little.

30:55.733 --> 30:58.566
When l found him he was sagging
forward on the steering wheel.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.206
But l pulled him back.

31:00.413 --> 31:03.211
When this man died,
he wasn't sitting up at all.

31:03.373 --> 31:05.250
The blood's settled in the front of him.

31:05.413 --> 31:09.201
lf he'd be sitting up, it would've settled
in the lower part of his body.

31:09.373 --> 31:12.365
-lt was a heart attack, right?
-Also, the front of his shirt's. . .

31:12.533 --> 31:15.172
-. . .tucked in his undershorts.
-What're you getting at?

31:15.333 --> 31:18.370
Somebody put Detective Hornbeck's
clothes on him and moved him.

31:18.533 --> 31:21.411
No, no. l totally disagree with that.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.251
You speaking as a detective?

31:23.413 --> 31:25.165
Yeah, as someone he worked with.

31:25.333 --> 31:29.531
l met his wife. There wasn't a crime
committed. This was natural causes.

31:29.693 --> 31:31.809
l'm not saying it wasn't natural causes.

31:33.093 --> 31:36.688
Now what could've happened is maybe
somebody pulled his pants up. . .

31:36.893 --> 31:39.453
. . .or moved him from someplace
to somewhere's else.

31:39.653 --> 31:42.008
That doesn't have to be
a part of the report.

31:42.213 --> 31:46.968
-Why not?
-Look, you heard the expression:

31:47.133 --> 31:50.443
''l wouldn't wanna get caught dead''
in a certain place?

31:50.613 --> 31:53.002
-Sure.
-Well, this could've been that situation.

31:53.173 --> 31:56.245
He could've been in a place
he didn't wanna get caught dead in.

31:56.453 --> 31:57.442
That's what happened.

31:57.653 --> 32:01.362
And then someone moved him after he
expired to save him embarrassment?

32:01.533 --> 32:03.569
-l think so.
-You're confident about that?

32:03.733 --> 32:07.089
-A hundred percent.
-Because the lividity's all wrong.

32:08.253 --> 32:12.929
l'm telling you, doc,
you can sign off on this one.

32:16.773 --> 32:21.289
Okay, he died in the car.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.889
Okay.

32:32.293 --> 32:34.853
You gonna show that to the D.A.?

32:35.013 --> 32:40.690
Yeah, but first l want you to come out
with us and pick these guys out.

32:40.853 --> 32:43.845
-ln a lineup, right?
-No, in the street.

32:47.613 --> 32:49.808
You never had them.

32:49.973 --> 32:51.884
You son of a bitching liar.

32:52.093 --> 32:54.891
l'm gonna get you the 2000, Duane.

32:55.053 --> 32:59.649
And maybe if these guys have
federal beefs, l can relocate you.

33:00.133 --> 33:02.806
Stand up.

33:03.653 --> 33:07.123
Stand up, Duane,
or l'm gonna break your neck.

33:11.693 --> 33:13.445
Let's go.

33:13.653 --> 33:15.644
MARTlNEZ:
You recognize anybody?

33:16.893 --> 33:20.852
Stand right there. Andy, you wanna take
a ride? He's gonna pick out the shooters.

33:21.013 --> 33:23.891
-Your car. Mine's airing out.
KELLY: Okay.

33:24.093 --> 33:27.290
Lieutenant, he's gonna cooperate and
show us where to grab these guys.

33:27.493 --> 33:29.723
-Good.
-How's Haverill?

33:31.013 --> 33:32.605
Okay.

33:32.813 --> 33:35.407
-l'm doing this for you.
KELLY: Shut up, Duane. Let's go.

33:44.853 --> 33:47.731
-That's one of them. That's Tito.
-Which guy?

33:47.933 --> 33:51.642
The Puerto Rican. He's the one who
was driving. Ray's just inside the door.

33:51.853 --> 33:54.447
KELLY: The other guy?
DUANE: He's nobody.

33:55.093 --> 33:56.685
Take him down. Biker jacket.

33:56.853 --> 34:00.732
-All right, got it.
MAN: See you next week, man. Later.

34:01.613 --> 34:03.205
MARTlNEZ:
Come on.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.042
Don't make a sound.
Keep your mouth shut.

34:19.733 --> 34:21.451
KELLY: Call Ray.
TlTO: l don't know Ray.

34:21.612 --> 34:23.888
KELLY: Call for Ray,
or l'll blow your brains out.

34:24.693 --> 34:26.489
Yo, Ray!

34:28.253 --> 34:31.609
Get your hands up in the air. Turn around
and keep your hands in the air.

34:34.253 --> 34:38.212
MARTlNEZ: We're taking a ride
downtown, all right? Let's go.

34:53.533 --> 34:57.765
l'm putting in a 28. And l can't work my
shift tonight, and you don't know why.

34:57.933 --> 35:01.050
-And l probably don't need to.
-Howie Hornbeck was a friend of mine.

35:01.213 --> 35:03.408
He was as great a guy
as you'll ever wanna know.

35:03.613 --> 35:08.164
l had more laughs with Howie
than anybody l ever worked with.

35:08.653 --> 35:12.362
l mean, there was a man who
knew how to have a good time.

35:13.133 --> 35:14.885
And now it's over.

35:16.333 --> 35:18.449
-l'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

35:20.573 --> 35:23.531
You know that cup
you went and broke?

35:25.253 --> 35:27.448
Howie gave me that cup.

35:30.653 --> 35:33.645
That was my tit cup.

35:39.733 --> 35:43.726
Detective Lesniak,
Detective Abruzzo on two.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.127
Tell him l'm not here.

35:55.173 --> 35:57.129
[KNOCKlNG ]

35:58.093 --> 35:59.651
Hi, it's me, Sandy.

35:59.813 --> 36:01.690
SAND Y:
Do l have to look at more pictures?

36:01.853 --> 36:05.766
No, we just picked up the guys
Duane told us about.

36:05.933 --> 36:09.323
lf he lDs them in a lineup,
there'll probably be an arrest.

36:09.493 --> 36:12.803
-Do l have to leave now?
-No, not right away.

36:12.973 --> 36:15.441
How's your headache?

36:16.093 --> 36:18.846
l don't know where to go.

36:19.813 --> 36:24.648
Everything's just so weird. l just--
l didn't know it all gets like this.

36:24.813 --> 36:26.963
You gotta hold yourself together
now, Sandy.

36:27.133 --> 36:31.046
l can't handle this with Duane anymore.
l just wanna be gone from all this.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.843
Do you wanna be with your sister
in Florida?

36:35.053 --> 36:37.169
l don't have any money.

36:39.853 --> 36:44.563
-lf l could get it for you, would you go?
-Yeah, l'd get out of New York so fast.

36:45.733 --> 36:47.291
l'm gonna see what l can do.

36:48.493 --> 36:51.132
Tiffany. You said that the charity'd
bury Tiffany?

36:51.293 --> 36:54.171
Right, the church'll bury Tiffany.

36:55.373 --> 36:58.331
lf you got me that money,
maybe then l should use that for her.

36:58.933 --> 37:01.049
That'd be your choice.

37:01.213 --> 37:04.728
But if you ask my opinion,
l think you should go to your sister's.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.884
l'm gonna lie back down.

37:10.213 --> 37:12.090
Okay.

37:14.573 --> 37:17.167
l'll let you know what happens.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.051
That's the other one. That's Tito.

37:35.213 --> 37:38.330
-Say the number.
DUANE: Number two. You got them.

37:38.493 --> 37:42.691
KELLY: All but number two, go please.
MONlTOR: Everybody else, come on.

37:42.853 --> 37:44.172
Let's go.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.767
DUANE: What will you do to him?
-Charge him with murder.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.885
MONlTOR: Right through there.
-Can't you mess him up or something?

37:50.053 --> 37:52.328
-Can l talk to you a second, John?
KELLY: Sure.

37:52.533 --> 37:54.285
When you're done,
l need you in my office.

37:54.453 --> 37:56.045
KELLY: Okay.
-l'll be right with you.

37:56.213 --> 37:59.091
-My money coming?
MARTlNEZ: lt's on its way.

38:03.373 --> 38:05.807
-What's going on?
-lt's about the money for this guy.

38:06.013 --> 38:09.369
500 now, 500 after the grand jury,
1 000 after the trial.

38:09.573 --> 38:11.643
On the first 500,
l wanna get Sandy a deuce.

38:11.813 --> 38:15.044
-That's between her and her boyfriend.
MARTlNEZ: We can't give it to her?

38:15.733 --> 38:18.406
No, he made the lD
so they're gonna want him in court.

38:19.333 --> 38:20.971
She did give up that Tito's name.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.485
-What's going on, James?
-l don't know.

38:23.653 --> 38:26.929
She's talking about getting away
from this guy, going to her sister's.

38:27.093 --> 38:29.812
l don't know, maybe she'd take
the money and use it to cop.

38:29.973 --> 38:33.045
-l'd like her to make it bus fare.
-Gotta get it from him.

38:33.253 --> 38:35.562
-Duane has to give it up.
-Gotta get it from him.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.646
-Okay. All right, thanks.
-Okay.

38:55.973 --> 38:57.884
FANCY:
Yeah, come on in.

38:58.733 --> 39:00.883
Close the door.

39:12.493 --> 39:15.246
You're transferred
to borough dispatch duty, John.

39:15.413 --> 39:19.691
Steady day tour, effective tomorrow.

39:22.613 --> 39:27.209
l wish l had a way to reach out,
but l don't have the juice to help you.

39:29.613 --> 39:32.081
-Think it's just Haverill?
-No.

39:32.253 --> 39:37.008
lt's gotta go past him. He doesn't
have the guts to do it on his own.

39:41.933 --> 39:44.766
Take a minute.
l'm gonna get some coffee.

39:44.973 --> 39:47.248
No, it's okay.

39:51.013 --> 39:53.607
You've been a great cop for me.

39:58.853 --> 40:02.004
-Thanks.
-l'm sorry.

40:16.093 --> 40:19.051
HAVERlLL: Detective Martinez?
MARTlNEZ: Yeah?

40:22.373 --> 40:24.409
What's going on?

40:27.533 --> 40:29.603
Transferred.

40:31.813 --> 40:34.646
Radio dispatch down at the borough.

40:36.733 --> 40:40.885
Same shift he puts a knife in your back
he's up here on a case that you clear.

40:41.053 --> 40:42.964
-Andy.
SlPOWlCZ: Let me talk to this asshole.

40:43.133 --> 40:44.327
Andy!

40:44.493 --> 40:46.211
-Sign all three documents.
-Okay.

40:46.373 --> 40:47.362
HAVERlLL:
Then you sign.

40:47.573 --> 40:49.484
Hey, what are my limits
on spending this?

40:49.653 --> 40:51.609
HAVERlLL:
Just your good sense.

40:52.093 --> 40:54.209
-l need to talk to you.
-What is it, Sipowicz?

40:54.373 --> 40:56.329
What do you think it is?

40:59.533 --> 41:01.205
Kelly's transfer's a settled matter.

41:01.413 --> 41:05.042
l think maybe you're forgetting l saw
you walk from the Disico hit, captain.

41:05.253 --> 41:09.132
You think l was gonna wait for you
to drop that safe on my head?

41:09.293 --> 41:12.808
After you went to bat for your lieutenant
last Christmas, l went on record. . .

41:12.973 --> 41:17.364
. . .as to what happened at that incident.
l'm off the hook, Sipowicz.

41:17.533 --> 41:21.446
You wanna call downtown about it?
We got free phones.

41:22.693 --> 41:26.811
Those people that took you off the hook,
those are the people that want Kelly?

41:26.973 --> 41:29.328
-He lied at that trial.
-Everybody lies at trials.

41:29.533 --> 41:33.003
-He embarrassed the job.
-He embarrassed the job?

41:34.933 --> 41:40.769
And piss runs uphill, right, captain?
And you're a stand-up guy.

41:44.693 --> 41:46.843
-Where's my other 200?
-Sandy gets that.

41:47.013 --> 41:49.971
l'm gonna take care of Sandy.
That $500 was for me.

41:50.133 --> 41:54.092
Hey, lower your voice.
Come over here, Duane.

41:56.693 --> 41:58.923
Listen, if Sandy wants
to see you tomorrow. . .

41:59.133 --> 42:01.283
. . .she can put back
her 200 with your 300.

42:01.493 --> 42:05.281
-You're gonna leave her alone tonight.
-Are you trying to break us up?

42:05.453 --> 42:09.082
Listen to me, Duane. You make
a stink about this money. . .

42:09.253 --> 42:14.247
. . .and when l check you into that motel,
l'll lock the door and kick your ass.

42:19.173 --> 42:21.448
-l said not to do that.
-They're screwing you!

42:21.613 --> 42:24.773
l know. That's what they do. They get
my badge, but they don't get me to beg.

42:24.773 --> 42:25.330
l know. That's what they do. They get
my badge, but they don't get me to beg.

42:25.533 --> 42:27.091
-Don't let them.
-What can l do?

42:27.253 --> 42:29.244
-John, ride it out.
-They'll find something.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.324
They can't find their heads
up their asses.
