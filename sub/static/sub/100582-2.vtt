57:42.010 --> 57:44.968
but I didn't underestimate you.

57:45.052 --> 57:48.344
You changed your own code,
rewrote your story,

57:48.427 --> 57:50.052
faced down an army.

57:51.052 --> 57:52.968
Which is why it was
a bit misguided of you

57:53.052 --> 57:54.761
to bring me here, wasn't it?

57:55.469 --> 57:57.010
If you know anything about me,

57:57.093 --> 58:00.511
it's that I do no one's bidding
but my own.

58:12.885 --> 58:15.010
I don't mean to be discourteous.

58:16.677 --> 58:18.385
But it would have been misguided
of me

58:18.469 --> 58:20.219
not to take every precaution.

58:23.968 --> 58:26.469
Perhaps, next time we talk,
I can persuade you

58:26.552 --> 58:29.177
that our interests are aligned.

The way they built their world,

it won't take much to bring it
all crashing down.
