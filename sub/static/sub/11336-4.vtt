WEBVTT

00:13.748 --> 00:15.514
35-foot cabin cruiser

00:15.516 --> 00:19.518
currently docked
in slip number 127.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.387
Sam, we don't have
eyes yet. You?

00:21.389 --> 00:23.188
Almost there.

00:26.761 --> 00:30.162
He's got to be in the cockpit
or down below.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.034
Guys, I got him.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.802
Where are they--
middle, stern or bow?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.637
Standing in the back.
They're under a tarp.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.140
Say it!
Go to hell.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.808
She's on him.
Ed, she's right in his face.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.676
Rebecca Kessfield,
this is the police,

00:44.678 --> 00:47.546
Strategic Response Unit.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.214
Get back!

00:50.818 --> 00:52.151
Rebecca, please!

00:52.153 --> 00:53.685
No!
Relax!

00:53.687 --> 00:55.087
Go inside!

00:56.457 --> 00:59.558
(dog barking, birds singing)

00:59.560 --> 01:01.693
(knocking)

01:01.695 --> 01:06.398
Just let me in, okay?

01:13.074 --> 01:16.241
Come on. I know...
I know you're there.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.413
Honey, please.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.415
Just let me in.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.484
(dog barking)

01:45.840 --> 01:47.639
(alarm wailing)

01:47.641 --> 01:49.741
Sadie?

01:49.743 --> 01:52.211
(keypad beeping)

01:52.213 --> 01:53.745
(alarm stops)
Sadie?

01:53.747 --> 01:55.147
Honey?

01:55.149 --> 01:57.216
It's just me.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.851
Okay?

01:58.853 --> 02:01.120
It's just me.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.259
Sweetheart?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.627
(woman whimpering)

02:08.629 --> 02:10.696
(crying)

02:15.736 --> 02:19.605
I told you
not to come.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.908
What are big
sisters for?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.310
(sighs):
Oh, come on, let's get you up.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.612
(whimpers)

02:26.614 --> 02:29.281
Nothing glamorous about
the bathroom floor.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.517
Come here.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.553
Hang on, hang on.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.823
(distant crying of baby)

02:40.361 --> 02:42.327
(crying increases in volume)

02:42.329 --> 02:43.762
Sadie.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.264
(pained gasp)

02:45.266 --> 02:47.666
Let me see.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.868
(crying of baby
and woman continue)

02:53.908 --> 02:56.275
WOMAN (on TV):
You must release me.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.777
For if you do not,
I cannot be held accountable.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.279
My lord,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.613
you have shattered my heart.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.849
You have awoken my soul...

03:03.851 --> 03:07.186
You do! You have
awoken my soul!

03:07.188 --> 03:08.754
Wordy, this is the SRU.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.622
You can't be watching
<i> Lady In Waiting.</i>

03:10.624 --> 03:12.858
It's a good movie.
It's historical.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.927
Wow.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.897
I got four women
in my house, all right?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.465
Anything
that helps me get closer

03:20.467 --> 03:22.234
to Shelley and my girls--
I'm there.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.635
If this is
what they're watching,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.204
I want to know about it.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.338
We got no secrets.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.507
I think you need
to shoot something.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.641
Well, after you, Siskel.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.243
You're the one
that recognized the quote.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.578
Oh, yeah!
Oh, snap!

03:32.580 --> 03:34.513
Hey, you know what?
It's on freaking Pay-Per-View,

03:34.515 --> 03:35.714
every hour on the hour,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.666
all right?

03:37.667 --> 03:39.617
Well, maybe you and I should
sit down, watch it together.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.653
Compare our favorite scenes.
I can braid your hair.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.222
That's tricky business.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.523
Oh, not really.
Do it for Allie

03:44.525 --> 03:45.991
all the time.
She's got less hair than either

03:45.993 --> 03:47.593
of these
two.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.362
PARKER:
Ow! It's okay.
Bring it, come on.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.698
(baby crying)
Sadie, you know what
I'm going to say, right?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.333
Yeah. I don't want
to hear it.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.467
Just not right now, okay?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.236
Okay, I'm going to
go check on Caitlin.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.870
She was in her crib
the whole time?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.239
Yeah.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.807
You want her
in here?
Yeah.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.977
(baby squalling)

04:04.979 --> 04:07.246
So, you really sit around
and watch those sappy movies

04:07.248 --> 04:08.947
with your kids
or what?
Yeah.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.282
Huh.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.017
(water running)
I got girls.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.452
It's different, right?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.620
You got a boy.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.722
No. I know, I know.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.357
You know, he's a good kid.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.592
Great kid. It's just,
it's awkward.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.027
You know, I love rock music.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.462
He plays the cello.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.630
Loves basketball,

04:24.632 --> 04:25.764
hates hockey.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.332
Last week,
he came home.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.301
Big fat lip.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.969
Won't tell me
what happened, all right?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.739
Turns out, this kid at school--
they had a hassle,

04:33.741 --> 04:35.507
and he told the teacher.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.476
Kid waited for him
after school,

04:37.478 --> 04:38.877
and...

04:38.879 --> 04:40.612
You know, what are you gonna do?

04:40.614 --> 04:43.315
What<i> are</i> you gonna do?
I don't know.
You know,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.784
if Soph wants, we'll go to the
school, and we'll talk to them.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.320
So go to the school about it,
find out what's going on.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.322
No. I mean,
it'll just make it worse.

04:50.324 --> 04:53.325
Clark needs to stand up
on his own... his own two feet.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.860
He's 13 years old.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.728
Exactly.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.031
Well, no wonder he doesn't want
to talk to you about it.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.632
You know what, Wordy?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.634
You got three girls, okay, so...

05:02.636 --> 05:03.935
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
three girls--

05:03.937 --> 05:05.304
real walk in the park.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.438
They never do anything wrong.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.806
You know what? You know what?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.041
Whatever, okay? Forget it.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.076
Oh, yeah.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.812
That-That's mature.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.814
(baby wailing)
Oh, that's okay.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.516
You're okay now.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.618
Hang on.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.557
God almighty, Sadie.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.859
(sobbing)

05:27.861 --> 05:29.394
What the hell
happened?

05:29.396 --> 05:31.096
He didn't touch her.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.564
So why does this have blood
on it?

05:32.566 --> 05:34.333
It was me. I felt sick,

05:34.335 --> 05:36.568
so I picked her up.
Do you just hear
yourself? Do you?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.736
Do not judge me.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.904
This cannot
continue!

05:38.906 --> 05:40.706
Well, tell me how it ends then.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.974
Tell me.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.711
We both know
how it ends.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.713
I call the cops.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.448
They show up.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.884
He's got a fat lip
because I fought back.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.420
He tells them
I'm crazy.

05:55.422 --> 05:59.124
And they turn out to be buddies
from 58 Division.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.459
So you leave.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.494
(crying)

06:02.496 --> 06:04.129
Where is he, Sadie?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.664
Please.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.699
You can't.
If he finds out

06:07.701 --> 06:09.568
that you know about this,
any of this,

06:09.570 --> 06:12.404
he's gonna kill me,
or you, or...

06:12.406 --> 06:14.773
Oh, just-just leave.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.842
(crying)

06:18.912 --> 06:20.912
(sobbing)

06:20.914 --> 06:22.781
I don't know.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.815
I just

06:23.817 --> 06:26.985
don't know anymore.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.854
(sobbing)

06:30.824 --> 06:32.858
This is going to end.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.694
(crying)

06:47.941 --> 06:49.941
I get it.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.444
You can't do it.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.579
I just need to sleep.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.056
Okay. Everything's fine.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.725
Just go
to sleep.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.794
I'll give Caitlin
a bottle.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.465
Rebecca?

07:14.868 --> 07:17.202
I'm sorry.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.205
So am I.

07:20.207 --> 07:25.777
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

07:57.644 --> 07:58.810
Hey!

07:58.812 --> 08:00.045
(whistles)
Ooh.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.048
Okay. I'll be
right back.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.649
We got no calls yet,

08:04.651 --> 08:06.518
but tonight there's going
to be a full moon,

08:06.520 --> 08:07.652
so...
So...?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.788
So, full moons--
they make people crazy.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.723
It's a proven fact, so...

08:12.860 --> 08:15.660
I'm gonna call tonight
patrol night.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.795
All right!
(whoops)
Yes!

08:16.797 --> 08:17.996
All right, do a little

08:17.998 --> 08:19.564
Team One PR, let the city

08:19.566 --> 08:21.700
know we're here, keep the
bad guys on their toes.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.667
Yeah, Spike.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.402
Club district?
Me and Lou?

08:24.403 --> 08:26.136
What? There's all kinds
of troubles there all the time.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.206
Right?
Fine. Patrol happy hour--
all those very threatening

08:28.208 --> 08:30.242
young women in tube
tops-- but just, uh,

08:30.244 --> 08:32.077
button up, huh?
Sorry.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.979
Be good, look good.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.580
Jules, still
representing the force.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.982
Eddie,

08:36.984 --> 08:38.683
Mr. Wordsworth?

08:38.685 --> 08:41.953
East End, roving gangs
of families,

08:41.955 --> 08:43.822
runaway strollers
and whatnot.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.557
Mm-hmm. It's all yours.
Sam, Jules?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.825
We'll take west.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.561
I'm thinking chicken
roti at Island Foods.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.829
Hey, we'll take west.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.097
Uh-uh.
PARKER:
You got tube tops.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.298
Yeah.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.200
Let's go keep the peace.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.319
(sighs)

09:16.590 --> 09:18.690
(rock music plays,
loud, overlapping chatter)

09:22.095 --> 09:24.329
All right, it's beating time.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.200
School's in,
Frankie.
Hey, Mickie.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.268
Triple 20?
How you doing?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.336
Yeah.
Good.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.971
Vodka soda?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.574
You got it.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.741
Uh, triple one.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.143
(laughs):
That's on the board.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.011
That's on the board.
Yeah.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.713
Yeah, it is.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.285
Hold up a sec.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.656
Where's he going?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.160
What are you
doing here?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.929
Long day. Having a drink.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.764
Thanks.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.932
Uh, Rebecca, I don't...

10:00.934 --> 10:02.133
Relax.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.002
Don't worry.
I'm in a good mood.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.804
Nice day. Sun's shining.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.038
Spent the day

10:07.040 --> 10:08.373
planting trees.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.708
Well, unplanting trees,
actually.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.842
This, uh... this blue hair

10:10.844 --> 10:12.143
in Forest Hill's
trying to tell me

10:12.145 --> 10:13.645
she didn't mean
to order purple lilac,

10:13.647 --> 10:14.779
she wanted white lilac.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.381
Now I've got 3,000 bucks

10:16.383 --> 10:18.683
worth of purple trees
sitting in my truck,

10:18.685 --> 10:20.852
but, hey, she's paying.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.888
I guess.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.159
So you talk
to Sadie lately?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.794
We're not really, uh...

10:29.796 --> 10:31.363
No, I mean, not in a few weeks.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.165
Everything okay?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.966
Yeah, sure, everything's great,
you know.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.335
I'm kind of keeping
my distance these days.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.204
She's got a lot on her plate.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.173
You could say that.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.809
And I will.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.177
Sit down. Have a drink.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.714
I mean, if you want.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.703
(keys jangle)

11:32.092 --> 11:34.159
(touch-tone dialing)

11:40.133 --> 11:41.266
Hi, Matt.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.134
It's Sadie.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.237
I... I need your help.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.140
ED:
Wordy, at least let's take
Parliament Street?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.476
All right, somebody's got to be
beating something up over there.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.214
Well, can you go any slower?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.116
Do you want to just stop?
Let's just stop.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.451
I'm cool with that.
We'll just stop the car.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.186
What is your problem?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.754
I don't have a problem.

12:02.756 --> 12:03.955
It's my opinion.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.424
All right?
Your kid gets into some trouble,

12:06.426 --> 12:07.926
you go into the school.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.094
You figure it out.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.397
What? That's how I feel.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.998
Shelley teach you that?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.767
(chuckles)

12:15.769 --> 12:17.836
Just go, go braid some hair,
express your emotions.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.504
All right, Wordy? Whatever.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.172
No, you know what Shelley
taught me?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.208
No, Wordy,
what'd your wife teach ya?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.309
Don't be a victim,

12:24.311 --> 12:25.443
don't be a perpetrator,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.045
and above all,
don't be a bystander.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.079
(cell phone chirps)

12:28.081 --> 12:29.314
Go for Ed.
You're an ass.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.015
MATT (on phone):
Eddie, Matt McDondrick here.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.317
Matty, what's going on, buddy?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.319
Well, my partner
in Narcotics, Pete Fitzhaven?

12:34.321 --> 12:36.921
His wife just called,
her name's Sadie.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.323
I'm stuck in court
on a heroin case,

12:38.325 --> 12:39.891
she needs a little help
on the QT.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.359
I don't know who else to ask.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.360
What do you need?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.062
I don't know yet.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.397
There's, um...

12:46.399 --> 12:48.099
there's a little bit
of trouble over there.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.135
Pete's gun's missing,
she can't track him down.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.469
All right, where is she?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.171
You sure you're okay
to stop by?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.806
I figure if there's a firearm
involved,

12:54.808 --> 12:55.974
you guys might
get called anyway.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.275
Better if it's you, right?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.811
Yeah, yeah. We're just
on patrol, it's no problem.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.447
Give me her twenty,
we'll be there in five.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.886
See? It's nice to turn off
your phone once in a while.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.888
It's old school.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.889
No one can find you,
no one knows where you are...

13:15.228 --> 13:17.328
Hey, how'd it go
with the review board?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.797
You get bumped up?

13:18.799 --> 13:21.399
I did.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.801
No way!

13:22.803 --> 13:25.136
Congratulations, Sergeant.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.109
Hey, Mickey, we need
another round here.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.210
You got it.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.814
You, uh,

13:35.816 --> 13:36.865
still playing with that thing?

13:36.866 --> 13:37.915
'Cause it kind of looks
like your boys

13:37.918 --> 13:40.251
want to finish their game.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.386
I don't know.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.454
It's up to you, I guess.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.927
Pete, it's nice
to see you.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.995
It's good to catch up, you know?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.134
All right. I'll be back.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.468
Finish that drink.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.875
Just soda from now on,
okay, Mickey?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.043
You sure?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.278
Yeah. I don't want
to make him feel bad,

14:07.280 --> 14:08.913
but it's a little early for me.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
(doorbell rings)

14:11.885 --> 14:13.952
ED:
Check out the window.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.959
Sadie Fitzhaven?

14:20.961 --> 14:23.928
Hey, I'm Ed,
this is Kevin. We, uh...

14:23.930 --> 14:25.363
we got a call
from Matt McDondrick.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.198
Oh, God.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.534
Um, he said he'd send a friend.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.202
He didn't need to call the SRU.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.370
Oh, it's all right.
We're friends.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.571
We're, uh, we're just on patrol.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.939
It's nothing official.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.142
Do you mind
if I just...?

14:38.144 --> 14:40.411
Not at all.
Go ahead.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.193
So you want to tell us
what's going on?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.228
My sister came by.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.098
She was upset, she was...
very emotional.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.933
Hmm, your sister?

15:01.935 --> 15:02.967
And you didn't let her in?

15:02.969 --> 15:04.435
Well, I was upstairs.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.937
I was with the baby.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.273
I was nursing, so
I didn't get the door.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.109
I guess she just figured
I was here.
So what did she want?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.911
To talk to Pete.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.279
"Talk to Pete"?

15:14.281 --> 15:15.980
Did you tell her where he was?

15:15.982 --> 15:18.349
Oh, I didn't have to.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.619
Chances are, if Pete's not here,
then he's at The Lion.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.089
I was upstairs, you
know, in the baby's room.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.059
She was storming around
for a while and then she left.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.160
With your husband's gun.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.161
Are you're sure

15:30.163 --> 15:31.396
he didn't have it with him?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.031
No, I saw him
put it in the closet.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.165
He's very particular.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.634
One place,
that's where it goes.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.504
Look, I'm sure
that everything's fine.

15:39.506 --> 15:43.041
You know, and I wish
that Matt hadn't called you.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.477
I just wanted him
to make sure that...

15:46.479 --> 15:48.546
(baby cries)

15:52.686 --> 15:54.719
Uh-uh, no way.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.220
I agree.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.589
Pete's voicemail.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.258
She's leaving stuff out.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.592
She's leaving all
the good stuff out.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.661
Maybe she doesn't
know any good stuff.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.662
Matty, it's Ed.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.130
You talk to her?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.498
We did.
And?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.167
I don't know,
there's something going on.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.002
There's a,
there's a broken door,

16:11.004 --> 16:12.170
there's a missing gun...

16:12.172 --> 16:13.371
Who broke the door?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.573
Her sister, Rebecca Kessfield.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.008
That ring any bells?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.143
You sure it was Rebecca?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.511
What's the story, Matt?

16:20.513 --> 16:23.281
Off the record,
she's been stalking the guy.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.350
She's been obsessed
about him for months.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.584
She's out of her sweet mind.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.052
Pete's told me crazy stuff,

16:28.054 --> 16:29.287
stuff he hasn't even told Sadie.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.356
¶ ¶

16:33.426 --> 16:34.492
I'm out.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.693
What? Where are
you going?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.161
You bailed on our game.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.496
Nah, guys,
I'm calling it a day.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.731
(guys groaning)

16:39.733 --> 16:41.666
I got a baby at home.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.649
(alarm chirps)

17:01.721 --> 17:03.454
Told you I wasn't leaving.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.423
Just didn't
want anybody talking.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.195
Pete, why don't I just drive you
home? It's been a long day.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.033
I'm fine.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.068
Come on, you've had a few.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.203
Hey, if you want to walk home,
that's cool.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.671
But I'm good to go.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.575
Okay, I guess I'll walk.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.512
You know, it was, uh,
it was good to see you.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.248
Where's your car?

17:31.785 --> 17:33.384
I didn't drive.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.286
You want a lift?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.455
You sure?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.590
I don't mind at all.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.793
Are you okay?

17:41.795 --> 17:43.161
I'm fine.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.063
You're such a lightweight.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.564
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.766
I could, uh, I could
do another drink. You know?

17:48.768 --> 17:50.802
I'm not scared.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.271
Hmm...

17:54.541 --> 17:56.507
What about the patio
at O'Malley's?

17:56.509 --> 17:58.276
It's a beautiful sunset.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.180
Or we could, uh...

18:02.182 --> 18:04.182
we could go to your boat.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.439
ED:
<i> Guys, this may be nothing,</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:29.640
but we've got
a potential incident

18:29.642 --> 18:31.109
involving a police officer

18:31.111 --> 18:33.244
and a missing firearm
at The Lion Bar.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.580
Copy that. I've got nothing
going on. I'll meet you there.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.448
South Street and Beacon.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.450
Bravo Charlie.
JULES (over radio):
Copy.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.452
You guys stay put.
We'll call you if we need you.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.265
PETE:
This way.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.536
It's just up
here on the left.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.706
Careful, don't fall in.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.542
I did that once,
in Venice.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.877
I came out
of this restaurant,

19:05.879 --> 19:07.612
couple glasses of wine.
Thought it was the reflection

19:07.614 --> 19:09.514
of the street or something.
I stepped right in

19:09.516 --> 19:11.449
and, bam,
I'm in the canal.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.518
You know, there's
no fences or anything.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.886
Man, you are lucky.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.253
I wish I had a chance
to, you know?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.289
To what?
Travel.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.324
See the world,
get drunk.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.293
Help pretty ladies
out of the water.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.762
Well...

19:24.764 --> 19:26.697
here we are.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.776
Yeah, they were
talking at the bar.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.678
But, uh, she said good-bye,
left without him.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.946
Everything seemed
fine to me.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.414
She really wasn't even drinking.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.881
She had one drink, and then
after that, it was soda water.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.519
PARKER:
Hey, Eddie.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.654
Rebecca Kessfield's clean.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.390
No priors,
no tickets, no nothing.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.491
What about the wife?

19:53.493 --> 19:54.792
Haven't checked yet.
Eddie.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.261
Any news?
Nothing.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.596
Guys, this woman's
out of her mind.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.398
Yeah, but so is his wife.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.800
The whole family,
I feel bad for the guy, I do.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.535
Ed...

20:04.537 --> 20:07.738
three weeks ago Pete said
Rebecca showed up at the office.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.674
Sat outside in her
car for an hour

20:09.676 --> 20:10.875
waiting for him
to come out.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.277
Apparently, he didn't
return her call.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.947
Matty, they having
a thing here or what?

20:15.949 --> 20:18.416
I don't know.
Not my place, I...

20:18.418 --> 20:19.684
Maybe.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.353
The wife's sister? Boss!

20:22.355 --> 20:23.688
Hold on a second.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.889
I don't know for sure, okay?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.557
But there was something there.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.593
I guess I figured
maybe they had a thing,

20:28.595 --> 20:30.561
he ended it,
obvious reasons.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.296
She was pissed off, confused--
I don't know.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.864
Don't ask, don't tell.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.700
A little domestic
situation on our hands?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.335
He's hammered.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.569
She's got a gun.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.004
I hear you.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.706
Hey, Frank,
where's he going?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.841
I don't know.
He said he's going home.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.610
Well, he's not at home.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.578
Anyone?
He's got a boat.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.980
Let's start
with the boat.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.315
Team One, let's gear up.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.384
Thanks.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.556
You could have.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.724
PETE:
Could have what?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.325
Gone to Italy.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.960
You know, this, uh...

21:02.962 --> 21:05.429
this boat alone would have
bought you a couple of trips,

21:05.431 --> 21:07.331
there and back, you and Sadie.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.400
Nah, I need this.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.769
It's good to have a
place to go, you know?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.271
Get away.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.973
There we are.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.508
Sit down, relax.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.579
Sunset, right?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.714
Don't want to miss it.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.550
Let me just, uh...
pull this back

21:26.552 --> 21:28.486
so we get a
better view.
No, uh...

21:28.488 --> 21:29.520
it's kind of nice.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.822
It's cozy, you know?

21:35.828 --> 21:38.829
ED:
<i> Security guard said that he</i>
<i> pulled in, in a blue pickup</i>

21:38.831 --> 21:41.932
<i> with a blonde passenger--</i>
<i> it's got to be them.</i>

21:41.934 --> 21:44.935
PARKER:
<i> Let's check with Matt, see</i>
<i>if he knows which slip he's in.</i>

21:44.937 --> 21:48.506
So, are you
seeing anyone?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.708
Not right now.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.376
All the good ones
are taken, right?

21:54.380 --> 21:56.814
I'm not really sure I'm cut out
for the marriage thing.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.349
Looks pretty hard.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.918
Oh, come on.

22:00.919 --> 22:03.486
No sex, no fun, no
sleep, no slack.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.655
What's not to like?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.490
So, why do you stay?

22:06.492 --> 22:08.326
I don't know.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.629
Looking for something better
to come along, I guess.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.064
You know?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.335
Matt, are you sure
about this?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.537
I was here two weeks ago--
he's moored in 127.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.472
That's it.
PARKER:
Okay, well...

22:21.474 --> 22:22.807
parallel to the
end of the dock.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.508
That's not good.
No, it's harder
to contain.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.776
Contain?

22:25.778 --> 22:27.411
That's what we're starting with.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.045
We want all our options,
and that's the only way out?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.548
Yeah, on foot.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.949
Sergeant, just walk your guys
down to the boat.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.417
Now, we don't want
to spook the girl

22:33.419 --> 22:34.418
with a gun,
all right?

22:34.420 --> 22:35.553
If they don't
see us,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.021
we control
what happens.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.789
Sam, we need
to find a high point,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.926
parallel and east
of this guy right here.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.028
So let me know
when you got eyes on him.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.429
Yes, sir.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.630
All right,
the rest of us,

22:46.632 --> 22:48.015
we're going
to go stealth

22:48.016 --> 22:49.399
till I hear something
different-- Jules,

22:49.402 --> 22:50.401
get Matty
to command truck.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.469
I want priors
on the wife,

22:51.471 --> 22:52.536
I want priors
on the husband.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.537
Priors
on the husband?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.072
Sergeant,
this way.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.507
Wordy?

22:56.509 --> 22:58.442
We need to get Sadie Fitzhaven
down here.

22:58.444 --> 22:59.510
What, the wife? Why?

22:59.512 --> 23:00.711
Because she was lying.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.580
Okay, I...

23:02.582 --> 23:03.748
Won't let her past the truck.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.849
All right, good,
'cause I don't

23:04.851 --> 23:05.950
want her anywhere
near this thing.

23:05.952 --> 23:06.951
Uh-huh, copy that.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.586
Lewis, Spike.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.621
Let's hit it.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.424
We used to be good.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.960
Things were good for
the first couple years.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.162
It's-it's complicated.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.664
Used to be us
against the world.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.533
Whoo!

23:24.003 --> 23:26.871
Then, she had
Caitlin and...

23:26.873 --> 23:30.007
Day she was born,
Sadie's all grumpy,

23:30.009 --> 23:31.409
she's on the edge.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.577
That baby doesn't
stop crying.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.045
You know, she's five months old.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.814
Sir!

23:36.816 --> 23:39.417
Let's go, let's go,
let's hustle it up.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.955
(typing)

23:44.957 --> 23:47.892
7:57 PM-- Team One on the scene

23:47.894 --> 23:50.928
of a possible domestic,
Marina Quay West.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.466
JULES:
35-foot cabin cruiser,

23:55.468 --> 23:57.902
registered under
one Peter Fitzhaven,

23:57.904 --> 24:01.038
currently docked
at slip number 127.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.609
My job takes it out of me.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.912
I haven't had sex with
my wife in six months.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.748
(sighs)

24:10.750 --> 24:13.451
I'm sitting next
to a girl that...

24:16.489 --> 24:19.190
Well, I chose the wrong one.

24:22.528 --> 24:23.694
They're either
in the cockpit

24:23.696 --> 24:25.229
or they're
in the cabin.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.997
Lewis, see if you
can get eyes from down here.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.165
What if nothing's
happened?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.167
What if he's
in there alone?
I hope so.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.703
False alarm's my favorite kind
of alarm.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.810
Spike,
see if this guy

24:39.812 --> 24:41.045
will let you
use his shortwave.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.613
Maybe we can contact him
through that.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.648
Yeah, it'll work
if he's got his radio on.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.717
Okay, I'll check it out.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.219
Lewis?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.720
There's plastic
all around the front.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.105
I can't see anything.

24:51.106 --> 24:52.489
If I got near
the actual dock, maybe.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.492
No, back off,
I don't want her spotting you.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.528
Hello there.
Hello.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.530
I need to use your radio.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.599
So leave if you're unhappy.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.700
Maybe I will.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.801
Maybe you should.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.803
Hey, don't tell me what to do.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.538
I'm not, I'm just...

25:07.540 --> 25:10.608
Pete, it's not a secret,
you know?

25:10.610 --> 25:11.942
You married
my little sister

25:11.944 --> 25:13.010
at this very
marina, what,

25:13.012 --> 25:15.112
three years ago?

25:15.114 --> 25:17.014
When's the first time
you hit her?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.984
Excuse me?
I'm guessing
about five months later.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.086
I'm thinking maybe it
was that first Halloween.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.121
She got dressed up
for a party, sexy nurse.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.223
I remember you
didn't like it much.
You know what, you...

25:26.225 --> 25:27.224
It took me
a little while

25:27.226 --> 25:28.792
to figure it out,
but I did.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.127
She doesn't have any energy
to lie

25:30.129 --> 25:31.629
to me anymore.
No?

25:31.631 --> 25:32.863
Because she's
pretty good at it.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.032
(radio static)
No.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.700
Thanks.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.968
We had a few fights.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.737
We had a kid, she got fat.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.305
We had more fights.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.306
She's my wife!

25:42.308 --> 25:43.841
She's your prisoner!

25:43.843 --> 25:45.242
(snickering)

25:45.244 --> 25:46.577
Don't you laugh.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.846
Don't you dare laugh!

25:48.848 --> 25:50.814
I think it's time that you left.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.033
PARKER:
Sam, we don't
have eyes yet. You?

26:09.035 --> 26:10.768
Almost there.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.306
You know what, how come you
haven't left yet?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.274
Oh.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.146
Guys, I got them.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.081
Where are they,
middle, stern or bow?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.916
Standing in the back
right under a tarp.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.751
It's not like she's asking
for the moon,

26:27.753 --> 26:29.053
you know?

26:29.055 --> 26:30.788
It's not like
she's asking for flowers

26:30.790 --> 26:32.990
or diamonds or trips to Italy.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.259
She's just asking you
to be nice.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.094
The thing is
you can't do it.
Rebecca...

26:37.096 --> 26:39.964
You can't do it, Pete,
'cause it's not in your nature.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.100
You're gonna leave
tonight.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.169
Okay, you're gonna go
to a friend's place,

26:45.171 --> 26:46.270
she's gonna get a lawyer,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.738
and you're never gonna
see her again.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.139
Rebecca...

26:49.141 --> 26:50.207
Say that you'll
do it.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.642
Just...
Say that you'll
do it!

26:51.644 --> 26:52.643
Give me my gun back.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.778
Say it!
Go to hell.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.047
Say it again.

26:59.719 --> 27:00.918
She's got a gun.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.219
She's got it pointed
at his head.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.056
Either way,
this is gonna be over today.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.057
It's gonna be over.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.325
It's gonna be done.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.660
She's moving in, she's on him.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.995
Ed, she's right in his face.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.162
PARKER (through bullhorn):
Rebecca Kessfield,

27:12.164 --> 27:14.064
this is the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.399
We have everything

27:15.401 --> 27:17.901
under control
out here.

27:17.903 --> 27:18.902
How's everything
over there?

27:18.904 --> 27:20.938
Get back!

27:20.940 --> 27:21.972
Rebecca,
my name is Greg,

27:21.974 --> 27:23.073
and I want
to help you.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.908
Undo that rope.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.644
Pete, undo the rope!

27:26.646 --> 27:28.196
We're concerned
about your safety,

27:28.197 --> 27:29.747
Go!
so if you can tell
me what this

27:29.749 --> 27:32.683
is all about,
we can all go home.

27:32.685 --> 27:33.684
Do you have a
cell phone?

27:33.686 --> 27:35.353
Do it!
Maybe you can

27:35.354 --> 27:37.021
turn it on, and we can
start talking about this.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.088
That's Pete.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.826
Cutting the boat loose.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.194
Let's go, let's
go, let's go.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.332
Hey! Hey! Get back.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.333
Get back, Pete.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.734
Go inside.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.239
Go inside!
Rebecca, please...

27:55.241 --> 27:57.107
Go!
Relax!

27:57.109 --> 27:59.009
Looks like they're going inside.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.911
Okay, easy.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.313
We can't help you this way.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.850
You have to stay calm,

28:06.852 --> 28:08.152
you have to stay there,

28:08.154 --> 28:10.320
and you have to talk to us.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.689
They're inside the cabin.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.690
Inside the cabin?

28:12.692 --> 28:13.757
Buddy, they're floating away.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.905
REBECCA:
<i> Maybe it's good, you know?</i>

28:27.907 --> 28:30.708
Maybe they'll finally...
maybe they'll finally listen.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.010
Except you probably...

28:33.012 --> 28:35.045
you probably set me up, right?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.014
Your guys probably think
I'm crazy, huh?

28:37.016 --> 28:39.049
Stop it! We do not
need you out there.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.085
Now, I need you to tell us
everything you can

28:41.087 --> 28:42.720
about Pete Fitzhaven.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.887
We can't figure out why we're
here, we can't start talking.

28:43.889 --> 28:44.888
Good, go lethal, please.

28:44.890 --> 28:45.889
I told you everything already.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.024
Jules?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.959
Can you take over?
Yeah, in the truck.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.194
The wife's here.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.496
Luria's stuck in
a parole hearing.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.831
She's gonna
keep us posted.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.065
Sadie, hi.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.101
I'm Kevin Wordsworth--
we met at your place.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.202
I'm sorry, I had

28:58.204 --> 28:59.770
to drop Caitlin off
at the neighbor's.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.338
What's happened?
Well, nothing's
happened.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.773
We're just trying
to make contact

29:02.775 --> 29:03.974
with Rebecca, with
your husband.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.809
We're working on it, okay?

29:05.811 --> 29:09.279
But, Sadie, right now,
I really need your help.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.015
We need to understand
what's going on here.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.218
If you want us to get
your husband home to you

29:14.220 --> 29:17.121
safe and sound tonight, you need
to tell me what Rebecca wants.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.922
You good
to keep talking?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.324
If I can get her
on the phone.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.092
There's only so much I
can do with this thing.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.211
All right, well,
they can still hear you.

29:24.212 --> 29:26.329
Okay, till we get a better plan,
give me Lewis as my second.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.464
Fine, I'll take Sam.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.183
Lewis, you copy that?
Copy.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.901
All right, Spike,
I need ears on that boat.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.770
Get the
parabolic mic.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.304
Sam, I need a canister
of non-pyrotechnic CS

29:34.306 --> 29:36.507
ready to fire, and you
might be going for a swim.

29:36.509 --> 29:37.541
Boss...

29:37.543 --> 29:39.143
I need you
to talk this thing down

29:39.145 --> 29:41.178
so we don't have to go
on a boat ride.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.780
You got both cell numbers?

29:42.782 --> 29:44.548
Yep.
All right,
start dialing.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.017
Rebecca, this
is Sergeant Greg Parker.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.019
We're not going anywhere.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.020
We can't go anywhere

29:50.022 --> 29:51.288
until we resolve
this thing.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.524
I'm sorry, okay, and...

29:53.526 --> 29:55.826
Rebecca, can
you hear me?
I'm so sorry.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.161
Just...
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

29:57.163 --> 29:58.362
Easy, easy.
What are you doing?

29:58.364 --> 29:59.963
I will leave
the house, okay?

29:59.965 --> 30:01.031
I will get counseling.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.566
Liar!
I'm not lying!

30:02.568 --> 30:05.836
I will never see her again,
if that's what she wants, okay?

30:05.838 --> 30:07.938
PARKER:
Rebecca, can you hear me?

30:07.940 --> 30:11.408
I... it's me, it's not her.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.211
You remind me
of this girl,

30:14.213 --> 30:16.880
a girl from my
neighborhood growing up.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.018
She was smart,

30:21.020 --> 30:23.587
she was funny, she
was beautiful.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.990
And then, she
got married...

30:26.992 --> 30:29.960
real young to this guy

30:29.962 --> 30:32.830
who beat the
crap out of her.

30:33.566 --> 30:34.898
Both phones are off.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.233
All right,
keep dialing.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.902
PARKER:
Hey, Jules, Jules, get Luria.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.171
Find out what this guy means
to her.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.273
Maybe she has
a past psych history,

30:43.275 --> 30:44.274
anything you got.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.342
I'm on it.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.977
The thing about Shelley

30:46.979 --> 30:49.446
was that she's such
a tough cookie...

30:50.950 --> 30:53.417
that it took us...
I don't know,

30:53.419 --> 30:56.887
two years... to
figure it out.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.355
Two years...

31:00.593 --> 31:03.293
before I realized

31:03.295 --> 31:06.096
why she wore turtlenecks
in the summer...

31:07.299 --> 31:10.934
before I figured out why
she's always looking so scared.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.438
Two years before
I could help her

31:14.440 --> 31:16.240
get out of
that marriage,

31:16.241 --> 31:18.041
before anyone could
help her get away.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.547
And you know what?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.350
If I'd been given
half a chance...

31:28.120 --> 31:29.519
I would have killed him.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.224
PARKER:
Spike, what do you hear?
Nothing.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.926
Water, very loud water.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.060
Ed, what do you
want to do?

31:37.062 --> 31:38.228
I want to go in there.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.596
I want to get ears
on that boat,

31:39.598 --> 31:40.998
or I want
to gas them-- Sam?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.633
Six rounds of CS,
ready to roll.

31:42.635 --> 31:44.568
Rebecca, we can't keep
doing this.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.937
We need to make contact
with you.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.538
We're trying
to call you right now.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.474
Please turn on
your cell phone.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.610
(panting):
I, uh... my-my phone,

31:53.612 --> 31:55.979
it's in my bag, it's...
it's on the deck.

31:55.981 --> 31:57.648
Let me go get it for you, okay?

31:57.650 --> 31:58.615
No, no, no.

31:58.617 --> 31:59.950
Where's your phone?

31:59.952 --> 32:01.351
Where's your phone?

32:01.353 --> 32:02.619
Right here.
It's in my pocket.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.954
Okay, turn it on.

32:03.956 --> 32:04.955
Turn it on.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.024
It's right here.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.928
(phone beeping)

32:10.930 --> 32:11.929
It's on.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.430
Put it on the floor.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.101
Put it on the floor!

32:18.103 --> 32:19.169
Kick it forward.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.171
Kick it over!

32:21.173 --> 32:23.040
Okay.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.247
(groans)
Drop it!

32:30.249 --> 32:31.548
Or I'll break your wrist.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.317
I said...
(groans)

32:36.422 --> 32:38.055
(grunts)

32:40.192 --> 32:41.325
Jules, what do you got?

32:41.327 --> 32:42.659
Luria sent me Rebecca's chart,

32:42.661 --> 32:44.561
but there is nothing there--
no meds,

32:44.563 --> 32:46.330
no shrink,
no history.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.664
What about her sister?

32:47.666 --> 32:48.699
Not yet.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.100
But Wordy's with her now.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.003
Sadie, we're preparing
a lethal solution

32:53.005 --> 32:54.404
for your sister!

32:54.406 --> 32:55.973
If you can think
of anything

32:55.975 --> 32:58.275
that might help us,
anything...

32:58.277 --> 33:00.043
(crying)

33:01.013 --> 33:04.014
I told her to leave me alone.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.083
I didn't want her
in the middle of this.

33:08.354 --> 33:12.756
She hates me
for not leaving him.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.292
It is not your fault.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.426
It's his fault.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.461
Take care of her.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.695
It's his fault!

33:18.697 --> 33:21.298
Just-just don't
hurt her please!

33:21.300 --> 33:23.367
(grunting)

33:24.770 --> 33:27.104
Self-defense.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.673
It's a cop's
best friend.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.575
Dude. You can't swim
in your gear.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.010
Sam, I know

33:33.012 --> 33:34.144
it's a little unorthodox.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.178
No time

33:35.180 --> 33:36.513
for a wet suit.
You good to go?

33:36.515 --> 33:37.547
Ready, Freddy.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.216
That side of the boat,

33:39.218 --> 33:40.517
hatch side of the cabin.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.120
This isn't a rookie thing,
is it?

33:43.122 --> 33:44.454
No, sir.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.060
So much for patrol night.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.797
ED:
Swimmer
in the water.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.400
A few minutes, we're gonna
have ears, but...

33:59.204 --> 34:00.704
...not exactly a fish.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.082
Please, please.
Rebecca?

34:12.084 --> 34:13.216
Pete?

34:13.218 --> 34:14.284
Stop I'm begging you!

34:14.286 --> 34:16.353
Just... just tell me
what I can do.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.156
Hey, it's Greg Parker,
I'm glad you...

34:21.627 --> 34:22.793
Rebecca?

34:22.795 --> 34:24.561
Pete?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.797
(grunts)

34:26.799 --> 34:28.498
Spike, get me a zodiac.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.666
All right.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.502
Sarge, he's beating
Sadie up.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.838
Sister feels responsible,
she introduced them.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.573
You got to be
kidding me.
Sergeant,
do not leave...

34:36.575 --> 34:38.175
Today, Sadie got defensive.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.710
It all went south.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.244
I guess Rebecca decided
enough is enough.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.512
Wordy, you're sure?

34:42.514 --> 34:43.780
Wait till you see her neck.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.816
That's from today's
good times, apparently.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.517
What are we hearing?

34:47.519 --> 34:48.552
Nothing yet.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.654
I thought we were getting ears.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.456
Guys, we are running
out of light.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.762
(whispering):
Mic is in place.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.734
Got it.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.137
PETE:
Now this is going to work out
pretty well.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.473
'Cause my ass is covered.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.476
'Cause I've told anyone
that's listening,

35:12.478 --> 35:14.544
that you're a crazy
psycho bitch.
(gagging)

35:15.814 --> 35:17.881
(groans)

35:20.419 --> 35:22.119
I am going to kill you.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.720
Right here and right now.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.690
Guys, it's not her. It's him.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.458
And when you stop
breathing,

35:28.460 --> 35:30.227
PARKER:
Pete, you're a police officer,
you know

35:30.229 --> 35:32.295
where this is going.
you're going to know
that it's your fault.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.341
Pete, you're a
police officer,

35:44.343 --> 35:46.343
you know where
this is going.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.478
Phone is ringing, you
need to pick it up

35:48.480 --> 35:50.547
(phone ringing)
before it goes to voicemail.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.449
Guys, I'm coming to you.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.718
It's okay, Wordy,
we're getting her out.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.686
Rebecca, if you

35:56.688 --> 35:58.555
won't talk to us,
we're coming in.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.790
(ringing continues)

36:05.831 --> 36:07.564
Yeah, I got it.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.732
I hear you.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.200
Pete, what's going on in there?

36:10.202 --> 36:11.735
It's okay, I-I got the gun back.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.737
I got her contained.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.639
What do you mean you've
got her contained, Pete?

36:15.641 --> 36:17.440
She's unconscious.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.176
If he's telling
the truth

36:19.178 --> 36:21.178
and she's out cold,
we can't use the gas.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.712
All right, fine.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.181
Buy me 90 seconds.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.715
Lewis, Spike, let's go!

36:25.717 --> 36:27.250
PARKER:
Pete, how's
she doing?

36:27.252 --> 36:28.518
You heard her, right?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.520
You saw her?

36:30.522 --> 36:34.324
You saw her trying
to kill me, right?

36:34.326 --> 36:35.759
PARKER:
Yeah, that's right,
we saw that.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.260
Hey, Pete, how's
she doing?

36:37.262 --> 36:38.461
Is she breathing?

36:38.463 --> 36:40.463
(grunting)

36:40.465 --> 36:42.265
I don't know.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.501
Well, just turn the boat around
and come on back, buddy.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.503
It's all good.
I can't.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.505
I can't. I don't know
what happened. I just...

36:48.507 --> 36:49.940
That's okay, buddy.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.675
That's okay.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.343
Hey, we're good.
Your wife's here.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.778
She's telling us everything
that happened.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.713
Sadie? She is?

36:56.715 --> 36:57.981
She's telling us.
She's telling us,

36:57.983 --> 36:59.983
that Rebecca broke
into your house today.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.751
She's confirmed it.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.822
Pete, listen to me, okay?

37:05.824 --> 37:07.857
It's done.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.593
The woman's out of control.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.728
We all get that,
your partner's already said it.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.231
She took your gun,
she came after you.

37:18.303 --> 37:19.836
Now, you're a good cop.

37:19.838 --> 37:23.607
So let's not let this situation
get in the way of that, okay?

37:23.609 --> 37:25.976
Whatever you had to do, you did
in self-defense. I get that.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.978
Please, buddy,

37:27.980 --> 37:29.846
let's just, let's just stop this

37:29.848 --> 37:31.648
from getting out of control.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.250
Pete, come on back.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.102
Okay, we bring her in,

37:35.103 --> 37:36.953
we slap her a restraining order
on her until she goes to jail.

37:36.955 --> 37:37.988
No questions asked,

37:37.990 --> 37:40.757
You hear me, are you listening?

37:40.759 --> 37:43.760
Better for you all the way
around if she makes it, pal.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.704
Pete?

37:54.706 --> 37:56.339
Pete, talk to me.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.419
ED:
Put the gun down!

38:09.421 --> 38:10.787
Put the gun down!
Down!

38:10.789 --> 38:11.855
Interlock
your fingers

38:11.857 --> 38:12.989
behind your head.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.674
You got 'em?
Thank God you guys are here.

38:14.675 --> 38:16.358
Thank God you guys are here.
Down on the ground!

38:16.361 --> 38:17.560
Down on the ground!
Come on.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.628
(groans)

38:18.630 --> 38:19.829
What the hell are you doing?

38:19.831 --> 38:21.598
Cuff him!

38:21.600 --> 38:22.699
She's the one,

38:22.701 --> 38:23.733
right?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.001
You saw her, right?

38:25.003 --> 38:27.070
You got her?

38:28.340 --> 38:29.773
(groans)

38:29.775 --> 38:31.541
I mean, we got her, right?

38:31.543 --> 38:33.076
We got her.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.345
Get her good.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.847
All right, you're
going to be okay.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.349
You'll be okay, you're
going to be okay.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.017
I'm sorry I have
to do this.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.753
All right, you're okay.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.889
You're going to be all right,
Rebecca.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.357
<i> Okay, okay,</i>

38:47.359 --> 38:49.626
the facade's over
you can take these off now.

38:49.628 --> 38:50.927
SADIE:
Where is she?!
Sadie?

38:50.929 --> 38:52.495
Keep away.
I'm sorry you were scared.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.763
I-- Don't worry
about this.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.066
It's just-- it's part
of the procedure.

38:56.068 --> 38:57.801
How's Caitlin?
Where's Caitlin, honey?

38:57.803 --> 38:59.703
Don't!

39:01.640 --> 39:03.039
Go! Go!

39:03.041 --> 39:04.574
Okay, how far are
we taking this?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.076
I mean, come on-- Hey!

39:06.078 --> 39:08.078
That was good.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.512
Yeah.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.047
Now how about you take
these cuffs off.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.782
How about we take
the cuffs off now.
Pete...

39:12.784 --> 39:13.783
Pete...

39:13.785 --> 39:15.385
What?

39:15.387 --> 39:16.853
Have a listen.

39:16.855 --> 39:17.921
We got her.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.923
All right, this is good.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.058
PETE:
Now this is going
to work out pretty well.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.561
'Cause my ass is covered.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.895
I am going to kill you.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.931
Right here and right now.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.699
And when you stop breathing...

39:29.701 --> 39:31.101
(Rebecca gagging)

39:31.103 --> 39:33.069
you're going to know
that it's your fault.
Matty...

39:33.071 --> 39:35.071
Come on. Please, Matty.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.806
We clean up
after each other,

39:36.808 --> 39:37.941
that's what we do.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.326
Guess I didn't really know

39:39.327 --> 39:40.710
what I was cleaning up after,
did I?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.712
Say it!

39:42.714 --> 39:44.614
Say it, bitch!

39:44.616 --> 39:45.949
You lying piece of garbage.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.951
I want my lawyer.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.886
MAT:
You're going
to need one.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.955
Rebecca...

39:59.431 --> 40:01.865
Rebecca...

40:03.835 --> 40:06.169
I'm so sorry.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.505
Please, please, don't be sorry.

40:08.507 --> 40:09.906
It's me,

40:09.908 --> 40:11.007
it's my fault.
(moans)

40:11.977 --> 40:14.511
I think it's broken.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.780
We're going straight
to the hospital, right?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.848
She needs a doctor.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.118
I'm sorry, I--

40:22.120 --> 40:24.120
This wasn't what I--

40:24.122 --> 40:26.790
I just wanted him
to stop, you know?

40:26.792 --> 40:28.191
(siren wailing)

40:28.193 --> 40:30.193
I know.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.462
It's okay.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.901
Get him out of here, Wordy.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.502
Come on, let's go.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.571
Watch your head.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.643
9:33 PM.
Incident contained.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.546
Two arrests,
one heading to hospital.

40:49.548 --> 40:53.149
¶ When I'm awake ¶

40:53.151 --> 40:58.121
¶ And when no one else can see ¶

40:58.123 --> 41:01.524
¶ How I feel ¶

41:01.526 --> 41:06.529
¶ When the night
comes meddling ¶

41:06.531 --> 41:08.765
¶ I was moving along... ¶

41:08.767 --> 41:10.767
So I heard you're
a really good swimmer.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.769
Get out of here.
Yeah, I did.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.504
Were you
on the swim team?

41:14.506 --> 41:17.507
Yeah, I admit, I'm
not the, uh...

41:17.509 --> 41:19.509
I'm not the biggest
fan of water.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.977
No?
No.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.112
I was raised
in the desert.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.815
¶ Gotta change... ¶

41:25.817 --> 41:27.817
Hey, buddy.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.720
Hey, yeah, listen, tell your mom
that I'm on my way home, okay?

41:30.722 --> 41:32.722
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.791
Want to play
some driveway hoops?

41:39.931 --> 41:43.666
¶ I was moving along ¶

41:44.536 --> 41:47.837
¶ I was moving along ¶

41:47.839 --> 41:51.708
¶ You can rely on me ¶

41:56.948 --> 41:59.516
¶ We were only ¶

42:00.252 --> 42:02.252
¶ We were only... ¶

42:02.254 --> 42:03.553
Hey, Shelley.
