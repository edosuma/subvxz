WEBVTT

00:40.374 --> 00:41.500
Excuse me.

01:37.973 --> 01:42.186
I enclose my name -
asking you, if you please - sir.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.105
To tell me what is true?

02:25.729 --> 02:30.484
Excuse me, Colonel Higginson.
I'm here for the job interview.

02:31.527 --> 02:32.528
Of course.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.029
Come in, my brother. Come in.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.657
Apologies for the delay.
I've just returned from Hilton Head.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.910
I did some strategizing there
with the brigadier general.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.913
Still find all this military stuff
a bit bewildering, but…

02:44.164 --> 02:46.583
if it helps advance
the cause of abolition, then I'm in.

02:47.751 --> 02:51.171
And I understand that you have also done
some work for this great cause.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.550
I ran a small abolitionist paper
out of New England.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.344
Of course.
The Constellation. I know it well.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.138
-You do?
-Brilliant writing in that paper.

03:00.222 --> 03:05.310
And you lent a substantial amount of help
to our mutual friend, John Brown.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.895
May he rest in peace.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.605
May he rest in power.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.608
Can I get an amen, my brother?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.194
Amen.

03:14.278 --> 03:17.114
It was your connection to Mr. Brown
and your work in The Constellation that

03:17.197 --> 03:18.615
made me want to hire you for this job.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.367
What-- Really?

03:20.450 --> 03:24.496
You see, Henry, I firmly believe

03:24.580 --> 03:27.499
that the first man who organizes
and commands a successful Black regiment

03:27.583 --> 03:31.211
will perform the most important service
in the history of this war.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.590
You know, Lincoln is not convinced yet.
But I truly believe that

03:34.673 --> 03:36.884
these men have the capacity to fight,
and we're gonna prove it.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.636
Eventually, Lincoln will sign
the Emancipation Proclamation,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.597
and this is gonna become
a federally authorized regiment.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.931
But to get there,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.517
I must prove to all the…

03:46.268 --> 03:47.644
let's call them skeptics,

03:48.187 --> 03:50.230
that these men are as brave,
as disciplined,

03:50.314 --> 03:51.773
and as learned as any white soldiers.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.817
-I see.
-Damn it.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.321
-There I go, centering whiteness again.
-Excuse me?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.867
It's always a challenge,
how to have this conversation,

04:01.950 --> 04:05.287
because, you know,
the standards that are being applied,

04:05.370 --> 04:07.372
well, obviously those are
the standards of white supremacy,

04:07.456 --> 04:09.082
the very system we're trying to dismantle.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.459
But at the same time,

04:10.542 --> 04:12.377
if my soldiers don't learn
to read and write--

04:13.045 --> 04:14.588
Shoot, there I go again.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.507
Not "my soldiers," that's paternalistic.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.469
I'm really trying to police my language.
Not "police," patrol--

04:20.552 --> 04:22.137
No, that's problematic as well.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.222
Damn!

04:24.056 --> 04:25.057
I'll do better.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.019
Sorry. What's the job?

04:30.896 --> 04:34.733
I want you to teach
the formerly-enslaved men

04:34.816 --> 04:39.196
of the First South Carolina Volunteers
to read and write, while at the same time

04:39.279 --> 04:44.076
acknowledging the painful histories
and racist power dynamics

04:44.159 --> 04:46.203
embedded in the very language
of English itself.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.956
What do you think?
Do you have the bandwidth for that?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.000
I want to assure you that,

04:52.584 --> 04:57.172
although this was until very recently
a functioning slave plantation,

04:57.256 --> 04:59.049
we are now operating in a safe space.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.722
I would be honored to work
as a teacher with your regiment.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.184
Hell yes!

05:12.688 --> 05:14.314
Look at us! We're shaking the table.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.399
Indeed.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.943
We are movement-building.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.696
Solidarity is a verb, my brother.

05:24.366 --> 05:28.495
This right here, us, these relationships,

05:28.579 --> 05:29.872
these are the true front lines.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.542
And we are gonna win this war.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.632
Your new South Carolina Volunteer students
await you.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.134
You'll know them by their red pants.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.554
Go. Start changing lives.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.638
Okay.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.452
Hey

06:09.453 --> 06:11.830
Hail O the time draws nigh

06:11.914 --> 06:13.457
All right, come on. Let's go.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.541
Hey

06:15.459 --> 06:16.460
Hey

06:17.544 --> 06:19.588
Hail O the time draws nigh

06:19.671 --> 06:21.298
Whoa, horse in the valley

06:21.381 --> 06:23.217
-Hey!
-Horse in the valley

06:23.300 --> 06:25.135
-Hey!
-Horse in the valley

06:25.219 --> 06:27.554
Hail O the time draws nigh

06:27.638 --> 06:30.224
-Who's gonna ride him?
-Hey!

06:30.307 --> 06:32.100
-Who's gonna ride him?
-Hey!

06:32.184 --> 06:35.479
-Who's gonna ride him?
-Hail O the time draws nigh

06:35.562 --> 06:37.189
Whoa, look over yonder

06:37.272 --> 06:38.315
Hey!

06:38.398 --> 06:40.067
-I see the sun
-Hey!

06:40.150 --> 06:41.401
I see the sun!

06:41.485 --> 06:43.737
Hail O the time draws nigh

06:43.820 --> 06:45.405
Hey! It refuse to shine

06:45.489 --> 06:47.449
-Hey!
-It refuse to shine

06:47.533 --> 06:49.493
-Hey!
-It refuse to shine

06:49.576 --> 06:51.912
Hail O the time draws nigh

06:51.995 --> 06:53.705
Oh, it's Judgment Day!

06:53.789 --> 06:55.499
-Hey!
-It's Judgment Day

06:55.582 --> 06:57.459
-Hey!
-It's Judgment Day

06:57.543 --> 06:59.670
Hail O the time draws nigh

07:00.295 --> 07:01.296
Hey.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.590
-Hey! Ha, ha, ha!
-Hey!

07:03.674 --> 07:05.300
Ha, ha! Hey!

07:05.384 --> 07:08.637
Hail O the time draws nigh

07:08.720 --> 07:09.721
Hey!

07:12.099 --> 07:13.559
Hey!

07:13.642 --> 07:15.978
Are you guys ready to get some education?

07:16.061 --> 07:17.604
Who's this buckra with the chair?

07:17.688 --> 07:19.773
Gentlemen, my name is Henry.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.233
Your commander, Colonel Higginson,

07:21.316 --> 07:23.527
has hired me
to teach you to read and write.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.153
What is he saying?

07:25.237 --> 07:26.572
Why he talk like that?

07:26.655 --> 07:28.365
My dude, what is that accent?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.076
-You think I have an accent?
-Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.578
Interesting.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.081
To my ear, you all are
the ones with the unusual dialect.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.712
You call it Gullah, if I'm not mistaken.
Native of the Sea Islands.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.881
Quite a melodious sound,

07:43.964 --> 07:46.925
but a bit difficult
to pick out certain words.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.511
He talks like a fancy cat
who drank too much milk.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.555
Bro, stop that.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.016
Well, as a matter of fact,
I am from Massachusetts.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.601
Oh, no!

07:55.684 --> 07:57.060
Yeah. Yep.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.105
That's pretty rich.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.400
Buckra coming around here
talking about he free,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
when he live in a place
with the word "massa" in it.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.322
But no, it's mass-achoo-shits.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.781
Master-two-shits?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.241
It sound like he sneezing.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.534
I definitely heard "massa."

08:12.618 --> 08:13.785
Yeah, it's offensive.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.413
You don't say massa
round these parts, buckra.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.207
Ain't no massas round here. We free.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.499
Not free yet.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.001
Freedom is a state of mind.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.294
Yo, Erasmus, cut that shit, man.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.879
Well, we're more free than we were.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.881
We're nowhere near as free as we could be.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.883
-Now you spittin'. Now you spittin'.
-I like him.

08:27.966 --> 08:32.638
Gentlemen, if I may,
I am going to help you get free.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.097
And just how you gonna do that?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.892
I'm gonna teach you
the crucial skills of literacy--

08:36.975 --> 08:39.186
You gonna help us get some clean uniforms?

08:39.269 --> 08:42.063
You fixin' to get us paid
to fight this war?

08:42.147 --> 08:43.899
You gonna get Erasmus a pair of pants?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.692
I'm just trying not to be a stereotype.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.445
More importantly, you gonna put
some weapons in these hands?

08:48.529 --> 08:50.989
We at war, buckra. Maybe you ain't heard.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.158
-Guns and money.
-And shoes.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.702
-And better food, maybe.
-In that order.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.248
You mean, they're not paying you?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.707
Man, they pay us dust.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.877
Well, they do feed us, so dust and grits.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.004
They say they'll pay us
ten dollars a week.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.757
Which is less than
what the white men get paid.

09:08.841 --> 09:09.925
They don't even pay us that.

09:10.008 --> 09:13.512
Yeah. So how about
you go tell Colonel Higgity-piggity

09:13.595 --> 09:15.097
that we ready for our paychecks.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.890
We want that shit in cash, man.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.308
-That part.
-So…

09:19.184 --> 09:21.311
they're not paying you,

09:21.395 --> 09:23.355
and they haven't been giving you
the right clothes,

09:23.438 --> 09:26.567
and you said you haven't been
receiving proper training with weapons?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.778
Proper training?
They won't even let us touch a gun.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.574
All we do is stupid endless drills
and dig giant holes for no reason.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.909
The army says
we can't be trusted yet with weapons.

09:35.993 --> 09:39.663
The army says we have to wait,
that we have to prove ourselves.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.292
We soldiers as much as any white man,
fighting on their side,

09:43.375 --> 09:44.418
and they afraid of us.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.170
We're not fighting on their side.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.462
You're not?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.047
No.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.008
We're fighting for ourselves.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.177
This is our war.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
It's not the same as theirs,
and it never will be.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.891
Well, whatever war I'm fighting,

09:58.974 --> 10:01.560
I know I ain't gonna win it
without a damn gun, buckra.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.521
What is "buckra"?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.148
It mean "white man."

10:07.065 --> 10:08.066
It's a Gullah word.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.861
It's a joke, man. Loosen your collar.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.867
So, can you get us some guns,
Mr. Master-two-shits?

10:18.702 --> 10:23.123
I will talk with Higginson,
and I'll see what I can do.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.668
-In the meantime--
-Yeah, what?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.255
In the meantime…

10:33.509 --> 10:35.344
maybe we can learn the alphabet.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.896
What's the matter, Edward? Bad news?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.273
It's always bad news, this damn war.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.192
It's turning the whole nation
into barbarians.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.028
Yes, it's a real hellscape out there.
What's happened now?

10:53.111 --> 10:56.782
My brother, Samuel, writes me that
his neighbor's plantation was ransacked.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.577
Union army came through like
Viking invaders, tore the place apart.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.622
Carved their names into the mantelpiece
when they were finished.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.791
Well, I've always said
he never should have moved to Georgia.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.126
It's a little late for that.
He's lived down south for decades.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.586
He's raising a family down there.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.879
Where are you going?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.423
-I have a date.
-With whom?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.717
Somebody you definitely
wouldn't approve of.

11:50.294 --> 11:51.879
"I celebrate myself,

11:53.547 --> 11:54.840
I sing myself,

11:57.259 --> 11:59.553
And what I assume you shall assume,

12:01.096 --> 12:04.808
For every atom belonging to me
as good belongs to you."

12:20.616 --> 12:22.159
Excuse me, I'm looking for--

12:23.869 --> 12:25.120
Pardon me, have you--

12:26.622 --> 12:29.791
Coming through. Coming through.
Let's keep it moving, people.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.086
Gosh! Sorry!
Hi, I'm looking for Walt Whitman.

12:34.546 --> 12:39.718
Well, then it's your lucky day
because I am Walt Whitman.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.181
Oh, my God--
Incredible, I can't believe I found you.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.183
Why? It's not hard to find me.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.811
After all, I am everywhere.
I am everything.

12:49.895 --> 12:52.314
I am the paving man, the canal boy,

12:52.397 --> 12:55.484
the deckhands,
the clean-haired Yankee girl,

12:55.567 --> 12:57.486
the conductor, the squaw.

12:57.569 --> 13:02.324
I am the rattlesnake, the alligator,
the panther, the black bear.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.161
I am Walt Whitman, cosmos,
democracy, Manhattan.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.330
I am New York.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.504
Okay. I'm Emily Dickinson of Amherst.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.175
New England. Massachusetts. Boston town.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.761
Yes, well, near-- near Boston.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.764
O, my soldier.

13:25.848 --> 13:30.477
The bugles and drums give you music,
and my heart--

13:30.561 --> 13:35.023
O, my soldier, my heart gives you love.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.776
This is-- This is why I'm here.
This is why I came to see you,

13:37.860 --> 13:39.027
Mr. Whitman, I am a poet.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.572
A poet.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.949
So then you must know the urge.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.743
The urge and urge and urge.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.413
Always the procreant urge of the world.

13:49.496 --> 13:53.584
To sing the song. To chant the chant.
To join in the great and infinite chorus!

13:53.667 --> 13:54.668
I'm moving on.

13:55.502 --> 13:59.089
Yes! Yes. So I am a poet just like you,

13:59.173 --> 14:01.717
and someone told me
that if I want to write great poetry--

14:01.800 --> 14:04.636
-Yes?
-Then I need to be like you,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.514
and I need to go out into the world
and confront its pain.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.684
So you're into pain, huh?

14:12.394 --> 14:13.395
Yeah?

14:13.478 --> 14:17.733
Well, then you've come to the right place!
This is New York City, baby.

14:17.816 --> 14:22.237
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,
and pain is everywhere.

14:22.321 --> 14:27.159
Follow me, Emily Dickinson.
Let's go hurt ourselves.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.955
-Good morning!
-Nice to see you.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.595
I'm sorry.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.900
My God,
it's such terrible news from Savannah.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.153
I wish there was a way
that I could help my brother,

15:03.237 --> 15:05.155
but I'm not even sure
that they're delivering

15:05.239 --> 15:06.615
the letters that I write him anymore.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.075
This damn war.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.328
You know it's dangerous for us
to be corresponding with Confederates.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.956
-It makes people talk.
-What the hell am I supposed to do?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.625
Cut off my own flesh and blood
because of geography?

15:17.251 --> 15:20.629
You know that's not the way I operate,
Mrs. Dickinson. Family is what matters.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.131
Why on earth
are you scratching yourself like that?

15:23.215 --> 15:25.342
Me, scratching?
You're the one that's scratching.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.426
I am?

15:27.177 --> 15:28.178
Yes, I am.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.224
I am itching. Why does my clothing itch?

15:32.307 --> 15:33.308
Yes, mine do too.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.602
What in God's name?

15:35.686 --> 15:37.521
Did you forget to do
the laundry this week?

15:37.604 --> 15:40.315
How dare you suggest
that I would ever forget that, Edward?

15:40.399 --> 15:41.859
You know I live for laundry day.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.778
-Then what the hell is making me so itchy?
-I have no idea.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.072
I can only assume
this must be Maggie's fault.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.032
Maggie!

15:53.704 --> 15:56.748
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then, I contradict myself.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.127
I sound my barbaric yawp
over the roofs of the world.

16:01.587 --> 16:02.921
Whitman, keep it down.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.883
I will keep it down,
and I will keep it up.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.052
And I will keep it going on and on
until the break of dawn.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.681
You see, I'm a poet of the body,
and a poet of the soul.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.185
So, what is pain to me
but just another side of pleasure?

16:16.268 --> 16:20.689
What is a poet but just one facet
of the all-powerful universe itself?

16:20.772 --> 16:24.943
You are not just Emily Dickinson,
you are everyone.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.863
You are every man here.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.116
So you must not just ask
the wounded person how he feels.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.702
You yourself must become
the wounded person.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.918
My brother, when that bullet hit you,

16:41.001 --> 16:43.212
did you feel
all that this country has been?

16:43.295 --> 16:46.131
And did all that it ever might be
run through you?

16:46.215 --> 16:49.092
-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
-Are you America?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.344
Yeah. I think so.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.347
Yes! Yes, you are. And so am I.

16:53.430 --> 16:57.226
And so is she, and so is he,
and so is every man here.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.062
And so America is the greatest poem.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.606
Let's move on.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.651
I'm not sure I'm catching all of this.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.111
What? No, don't try to catch it.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.906
Instead just let it go.

17:10.989 --> 17:15.327
Drop out of your brain
down into your body and feel.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.913
The pleasure, the pain,
the sunlight, the shade.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.208
Just exist as you are. That is enough.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.961
-I'm dying.
-Yes! You are dying.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.422
And you are lucky.
Do you think it is lucky to be born?

17:27.506 --> 17:30.384
Well, I hasten to inform you
it is just as lucky to die.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.344
And every man here is dying.

17:32.427 --> 17:37.140
Every man here is dying
of multiple causes:

17:37.224 --> 17:40.352
gangrene, syphilis, dysentery, gunshot,

17:40.435 --> 17:43.647
bayonet, dysentery, dysentery, dysentery.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.318
-Louisa?
-Emily.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.946
-You know her?
-This is Louisa May Alcott.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.365
It's so good to see you here
on the front lines.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.243
-What are you doing here?
-I'm also a Civil War nurse.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.037
Yet another surprising,
but legitimate actual fact about me.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.790
You know, I get so much great material
from doing this.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.543
I'm learning a lot,
but great fiction is always based in fact,

18:04.626 --> 18:06.879
and this place is
chock-full of specificity and detail,

18:06.962 --> 18:08.380
you know what I mean?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.090
Right, you mean, like,

18:10.174 --> 18:15.179
the inextricable nature
of death and life, of pain and ecstasy?

18:17.097 --> 18:19.808
Yeah.
No, like how wounds actually smell bad.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.019
Honestly, when some of these guys
show up here,

18:22.102 --> 18:24.813
it is the vilest odor
that has ever assaulted the human nose.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.024
It's kinda gross, but, you know,
facts are facts.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.153
He's gone!

18:31.236 --> 18:34.907
He died in your arms! Oh, life! Identity!

18:34.990 --> 18:37.242
-This is really, really great material.
-The powerful play…

18:37.326 --> 18:39.369
I'm gonna take some notes. Death sells.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.955
Poor boy.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.541
Daddy. Daddy, is that you?

18:44.625 --> 18:47.920
Yes. I am your daddy.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.755
Sometimes we pretend to be their family,

18:49.838 --> 18:51.882
so they feel they get the chance
to say goodbye.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.467
I am your father.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.219
And I am your son,

18:55.302 --> 18:57.346
and your mother, and your neighbor.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.389
Yeah, he just takes it
a little bit too far.

18:59.473 --> 19:03.268
-Sure.
-My son, how is your bloody stump today?

19:03.894 --> 19:05.395
Daddy, 'tis fearsome indeed.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.148
Well, it ought to raise
your spirits to know

19:08.232 --> 19:11.235
I've brought your dear sister
here to see you.

19:11.902 --> 19:15.364
Sister? My sister Annabelle, is that you?

19:16.365 --> 19:20.285
Yes. Yes, I am your sister.

19:20.369 --> 19:24.206
Sister! I cannot enter
into the kingdom of heaven

19:24.289 --> 19:26.375
until you wish me farewell.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.418
Won't you grant your poor brother
one last kiss?

19:28.502 --> 19:30.838
Come on. He gave his life for the Union.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.756
Give him a smooch.

19:34.675 --> 19:35.843
For Christ's sake.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.427
Come here, boy.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.389
Walt, come on, too far.

19:41.515 --> 19:44.434
Like you never saw two men embrace
on your dad's commune.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.395
Who needs a drink?

19:47.312 --> 19:51.859
'Twas a Friday morn when we set sail

19:51.942 --> 19:55.571
And we were not far from the land

19:56.154 --> 20:00.158
Our captain, he spied a lovely mermaid

20:00.242 --> 20:04.204
With a comb and a glass in her hand

20:04.288 --> 20:07.958
Oh, the ocean waves will roll…

20:08.041 --> 20:09.710
What is this place?

20:09.793 --> 20:13.088
Pfaff's Beer Cellar,
the greatest bar in New York City.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.632
It's amazing. You can smoke inside.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.634
Shall we?

20:17.718 --> 20:21.680
And the landlubbers lie
Down below, below, below

20:21.763 --> 20:25.475
The landlubbers lie down below

20:34.526 --> 20:36.445
-Austin, keep it down, please.
-Okay.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.696
You'll wake him up.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.780
Okay.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.871
He is pretty cute, isn't he?

20:47.331 --> 20:50.167
Can tell just by looking at him
he's a Dickinson.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.587
You doubted that?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.426
Don't rock the bassinet.
You'll wake him up.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.303
I'm not rocking it, okay?

21:05.849 --> 21:07.976
You need to trust my instincts more.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.812
I can be a good father, you know.

21:11.980 --> 21:16.401
In my experience,
good fathers just stay out of the way.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.702
Austin, you'll wake him up. Please.

21:35.212 --> 21:38.799
I had a little nut tree

21:40.884 --> 21:42.928
Nothing would it bear

21:45.347 --> 21:47.099
But a silver nutmeg

21:47.182 --> 21:49.726
Austin, please stop singing.
You will wake him up.

21:49.810 --> 21:50.853
Please, he's sleeping.

21:50.936 --> 21:53.272
-King of Spain's daughter
-Austin, he is sleeping.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.565
Came to visit--

21:54.648 --> 21:57.234
-Austin.
-I know how to take care of him, Sue.

22:00.612 --> 22:01.738
He's my son.

22:02.239 --> 22:05.534
Have you been drinking again?
You always sing when you're drunk.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.997
I hope our child doesn't inherit
all your traits.

22:40.611 --> 22:42.321
You're far too cerebral.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.865
You need to get out of your mind
and into your body.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.409
To be a great poet,
you have to feel everything.

22:47.492 --> 22:52.497
All this I swallow, it tastes good,
I like it well, it becomes mine.

22:52.581 --> 22:56.251
I am the man. I suffered. I was there!

23:04.635 --> 23:06.136
Yes!

23:06.970 --> 23:08.263
Bartender, another round!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.433
-The agony.
-It burns.

23:11.517 --> 23:12.851
Scratch me harder, Maggie.

23:12.935 --> 23:15.187
What the hell is causing
this infernal itching?

23:15.270 --> 23:18.565
-Is it poisonous ants?
-That don't seem likely, sir.

23:18.649 --> 23:20.901
I'm thinking there's
a much more reasonable explanation.

23:20.984 --> 23:21.985
Yes? Like what?

23:22.069 --> 23:24.613
My common sense tells me
that it's probably elves.

23:25.197 --> 23:28.617
-I'm sorry, did you say--
-Elves. Tiny men.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.204
Always full of mischief, they are.
Spreading their powders around.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.288
Their powders?

23:33.372 --> 23:35.874
Normally, it's a good sign
to have elves in the house.

23:35.958 --> 23:38.001
Somebody must have done
something to upset them.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.503
The elves are upset.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.671
Looks that way.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.674
-And now they've become disruptive.
-Edward, what are we gonna do?

23:43.757 --> 23:46.760
We do not have magical creatures
living in this house, Mrs. Dickinson.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.221
Monster!

23:49.304 --> 23:51.849
Lavinia, what the hell happened to you?

23:51.932 --> 23:53.725
Why are you covered in dirt?

23:53.809 --> 23:55.143
I buried myself alive.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.520
May I ask why?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.856
To honor the fallen soldiers.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.275
I wanna experience
everything they experienced.

24:01.358 --> 24:04.736
I wanna feel all their pain.
Brings me closer to them.

24:05.362 --> 24:08.198
That's why I dismantled my canopy bed
and started sleeping in the barn.

24:08.282 --> 24:10.617
You've been sleeping
in the barn with the horses?

24:10.701 --> 24:12.119
That would explain the smell.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.496
Yeah, I slept in the barn last night.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.708
But, unfortunately,
the cot was infested with fleas.

24:18.709 --> 24:19.751
-Fleas?
-Fleas?

24:19.835 --> 24:23.422
Aye, fleas. Not elves, fleas.
'Twas my next guess.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.758
-You brought fleas into this house.
-And that's why we're itching so badly!

24:26.842 --> 24:28.218
Yeah. Absolutely.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.220
Damn it! They're everywhere!

24:30.304 --> 24:32.181
Edward, how do we get rid of them?

24:32.264 --> 24:35.684
We need to fumigate.
Fill the house with sulfur. Everybody out.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.769
Has anyone seen Emily?

24:43.817 --> 24:47.029
Wow. I feel crazy.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.698
Yes. Good. Poets should feel crazy.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.826
Crazy and wild and free.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.621
But I can't stop thinking
about the dying soldiers.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.498
-They were all in so much pain. I--
-Pain is good for a poet.

24:58.582 --> 25:01.585
All feelings are.
Yeah, the more intense, the better.

25:01.668 --> 25:06.298
We must feel maximum pain
and maximum pleasure.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.343
So, tell me, Emily Dickinson,

25:09.927 --> 25:11.553
what turns you on?

25:12.930 --> 25:14.431
I don't know.

25:14.515 --> 25:15.807
Of course you know.

25:15.891 --> 25:19.478
Come on! What turns you on?
What riles you up? What gets you hot?

25:20.979 --> 25:23.857
-I'm thinking--
-No! Stop thinking. Stop thinking.

25:23.941 --> 25:27.444
-Just say it. Say it right now!
-Okay! It's Sue.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.491
Now we're talking.

25:32.574 --> 25:36.870
Okay. So, who's Sue?

25:38.038 --> 25:40.290
Right. Well, Sue is my--

25:41.416 --> 25:44.002
-She's my--
-Your?

25:44.086 --> 25:46.046
Okay, she's sort of my friend.

25:46.129 --> 25:49.341
Right, she's sort of my sister.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.553
And she's also my sort of my…

25:53.220 --> 25:54.638
-Lover?
-Yeah.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.517
Fabulous! Yes.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.646
And is it with Sue that you drain
all the pent-up rivers of yourself?

26:03.272 --> 26:04.398
Excuse me?

26:04.481 --> 26:08.151
Is it with Sue that you wrap
a thousand onward years?

26:08.235 --> 26:11.446
Is it with Sue that you envelop?
Sue that you draw close?

26:11.530 --> 26:13.365
Sue that you cannot let go?

26:13.448 --> 26:16.451
Is it with Sue that you interpenetrate?

26:16.535 --> 26:17.661
What?

26:19.663 --> 26:22.124
Well, yeah.

26:22.207 --> 26:25.961
Say it then! Shout it out loud!
Free love! Free expression!

26:26.044 --> 26:27.254
Sex, sex, sex.

26:27.921 --> 26:32.009
Let me tell you, whether you sing a song,
or make a machine,

26:32.092 --> 26:34.595
or go to the North Pole,
or love your mother,

26:34.678 --> 26:37.097
or build a house, or black shoes,

26:37.181 --> 26:41.226
anything, anything at all,
is sex, sex, sex.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.813
-I love Sue.
-I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

26:44.897 --> 26:47.274
-Scream it.
-I love Sue!

26:48.066 --> 26:49.067
Okay?

26:49.735 --> 26:53.363
I love Sue! And I want her!
And I can't get enough of her!

26:53.447 --> 26:57.201
And if I was on my deathbed right now,
all I would want is Sue!

26:58.035 --> 26:59.119
Hell yes!

27:00.579 --> 27:02.122
Now that's a poem.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.041
Wanna dance?

27:04.124 --> 27:07.503
Hang on. Hang on, I'm still trying
to understand if my poetry--

27:07.586 --> 27:12.758
No, my dear,
stop trying to understand and just feel.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.761
When you give, give yourself.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.972
Drink with the drinkers.
Dance with the dancers.

27:19.056 --> 27:20.265
Come on!

27:25.729 --> 27:28.232
New York is back!

27:35.197 --> 27:36.865
This is my letter to the World

27:43.664 --> 27:45.165
That never wrote to Me -

27:50.838 --> 27:53.298
The simple news that nature told -

27:57.886 --> 27:59.555
With tender majesty

28:05.269 --> 28:06.937
Her message is committed

28:09.147 --> 28:10.983
To Hands I cannot see -

28:14.152 --> 28:16.780
For love of Her - sweet - countrymen -

28:20.033 --> 28:22.035
Judge tenderly - of me
