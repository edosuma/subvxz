You ready?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.287
RATE YOUR BOYFRIEND

02:02.288 --> 02:05.057
- <i>How am I doing?</i>
- Sure you want to know?

02:05.059 --> 02:08.460
"Does your boyfriend
always get his way?"

02:08.461 --> 02:10.762
Yes.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.165
"Does he admit
when he's wrong?"

02:13.167 --> 02:15.734
Never.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.903
Does your boyfriend know how
to build a fire with no matches?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.405
Answer is D, who cares.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.774
A, yes. Very well.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.176
Sorry, that question's
not on here.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.111
- <i>It should be in there.</i>
- Sorry.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.846
So you're still zero.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.771
- No-o-o!
- Oh, yeah-h-h!

03:16.830 --> 03:18.564
Put your hands on the wheel.

03:29.700 --> 03:34.800
BACKCOUNTRY

04:12.085 --> 04:14.419
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.289
- <i>Just give me a second, will you?</i>
- Yeah, sure.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.190
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, good.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.459
Uh, we're reserved under Louis.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.382
- What's the name?
- Alex Louis.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.300
<i>Yeah, sign in here.</i>
<i>You're ready to go.</i>

04:28.302 --> 04:30.802
<i>Your canoe will be</i>
<i>right down there by the water.</i>

04:30.804 --> 04:32.604
<i>Bring it back Monday at five.</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.439
That's right,
back to work Tuesday.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.608
- Need a map?
- No, I'm good.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.444
You don't want a map?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.413
No. No.
I know this park well.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.282
It's kinda end of
the season, right?

04:43.284 --> 04:45.083
I mean the weather
can change on you..

04:45.085 --> 04:46.585
Just turn on a dime.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.753
Less people.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.088
Amen to that.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.457
You mind me askin' you,
Mr. No Map..

04:52.459 --> 04:53.759
Where you're headed?

04:53.761 --> 04:56.228
Blackfoot Trail.
I can't wait to show her.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.664
It's her first time here.
It's gonna be awesome.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.066
I got some bad news for you,
I'm really sorry about this

05:01.068 --> 05:03.268
but Blackfoot Trail's
closed for the season.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.903
- Why?
- Had to.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.638
I mean, so many yahoos

05:06.640 --> 05:09.441
you know, trampin' around there,
disrespecting everything.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.109
This is a treasured site.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.778
I don't have to tell you
I guess.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.814
And Parks and Recreation
want to keep it that way.

05:15.816 --> 05:20.152
Look, going to Blackfoot Trail
is kinda the whole point of this trip.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.987
It's 500 bucks

05:21.989 --> 05:24.089
if you're caught up there. Each.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.725
That'll be a 1000 bucks
expensive little camping trip.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.529
Alright.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.863
Jenn, you ready?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, hang on.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.335
Hey, rodeo,
here's your medical kit

05:36.337 --> 05:38.437
and there's a whistle in there,
try to bring that back

05:38.439 --> 05:40.639
and I'll try not to charge you.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.940
Thousand bucks?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.176
You're pretty good.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.814
Bye. You have a nice trip.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.948
<i>Thanks.</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:11.536
- Really?
- Last one.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.804
Come on, babe.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.339
This is really important.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.574
You know, we've been waiting
forever for this.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.176
I'm..
Just... just give me..

06:18.178 --> 06:21.079
They're all important.
Can't wait till we get back?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.850
Okay, I'm done. Okay?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.251
Alright.
I don't believe you, but..

06:26.253 --> 06:27.886
Well, putting it away,
so it's..

06:27.888 --> 06:29.654
Oh, hang on, hang on.
Let's take a picture.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.223
Just to mark the departure.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.091
- Put it to good use, right?
- Fine.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.092
Okay.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.168
- Good.
- Yeah.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.470
- One of us looks good.
- Alright.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.716
- Hey.
- Hey, have a good one.
- Thanks a lot.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.354
- Fuck!
- You okay?

08:42.356 --> 08:45.857
Oh, fuck, fuck that!
Fuckin' hurt like a bitch.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.527
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

08:48.529 --> 08:51.263
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>I'll just walk it off.</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:55.200
This is for you.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.538
You look scared anyway.
Feel safe.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.607
I probably won't need it.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.111
Got it taken care of already.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.584
Look what I got.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.924
- When did you get that?
- I got it a few days ago.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.254
- You're not gonna need it.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.157
Do you wanna have a good time on this trip
or do you want me to be freaking out?

09:19.159 --> 09:23.094
- This is what makes me feel safe.
- Okay. Okay.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.196
Well, if you can have it
it's useless in your bag.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.165
Give it to me. Thanks.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.834
Just gonna clip it
to your belt, alright?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.677
And you're not gonna need it.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.339
Bear spray.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.009
Wonder what other goodies
you have in there.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.411
- Nothin'.
- Let's see.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.147
I don't have anything in there.
Hey, there's nothing.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.517
- Oh, come on.
- What?

09:45.519 --> 09:48.019
Seriously?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.055
- This is a road flare.
- I know what it is.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.223
Yeah. This is for when your car breaks
down on the side of the highway.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.391
- Mm-hmm.
- You know this.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.860
I know you know this.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.096
Jenn, come on, if you wanted a flare,
I could've picked up a pen flare.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.058
They sell them
at any camping store.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.022
- Here's your flare.
- Thank you.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.808
- You ready?
- Think so.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.343
Okay.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.047
Oh, my God.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.353
- You good?
- Yes.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.614
- Huh?
- What, sorry, what?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.350
Jenn, you know
we'd be lucky to see

10:52.352 --> 10:53.918
anything bigger
than a chipmunk, right?

10:53.920 --> 10:54.886
Mm-hmm.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.563
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.968
Pfft! No!

11:49.308 --> 11:52.077
Hey, look at that.
That's cute.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.045
We should take it.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.927
- Here's a good spot.
- Yeah.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.885
Counselor, back up, please.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.905
Tryin' to turn me on right now?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.407
Is it working?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.476
Oh, yeah. It's pretty hot.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.479
Speaking of..

12:31.550 --> 12:33.518
Do you remember the little
swimming hole we walked by?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.788
- Nope, I don't. No.
- Really?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.725
- You said you would.
- <i> I didn't say that.</i>

12:40.727 --> 12:41.793
Yes, you did.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.628
- I said maybe.
- No, no, no.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.231
You said yes.
Come on, babes.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.467
No. It's like when you say, "Do you
want to order Chinese food tonight?"

12:49.469 --> 12:52.904
And I go, "Maybe,"
and then we get Italian.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.105
It's like that.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.940
I'm gonna be
all lonely by myself.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.575
Well, no one's making you
do this.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.810
Stop it!

13:03.082 --> 13:05.350
Oh, my God, please.
What if there's..

13:08.120 --> 13:09.587
Don't leave me hangin', babe.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.491
Okay, okay. Fine.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.074
- You ready?
- No.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.110
Come on.

13:37.082 --> 13:40.819
5...4...3, 2, 1!

13:40.821 --> 13:41.886
Whoo!

13:43.422 --> 13:45.256
Aah! Whoo!

13:46.592 --> 13:48.693
- Jenn, come on!
- <i> No!</i>

13:48.695 --> 13:49.994
- Whoo!
- <i> It's freezing.</i>

13:49.996 --> 13:51.529
Whoo!

14:02.041 --> 14:04.342
I'm gonna get some more wood
before it gets too dark.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.544
Okay, I'll come help you.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.112
No, no, I'll be back
in a second.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.347
Okay. Yeah.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.719
- Hello.
- Oh.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.915
<i>How long have you been?</i>

15:16.917 --> 15:19.083
<i>Oh, at this time..</i>

15:20.886 --> 15:22.120
What?

15:46.111 --> 15:48.780
Hey. Uh, this is Alex.
Alex this is Brad.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.282
- Brad, right?
- Yeah. Hi, how are you?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.650
I'm good. Thanks.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.887
Were you just walkin' by or..

15:55.889 --> 15:57.288
Oh, yeah, I was comin' up
the trail

15:57.290 --> 15:58.623
and I ran into your friend here

15:58.625 --> 16:00.158
and she invited me over
for a chat.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.493
Yeah. Turns out that he also

16:02.495 --> 16:04.295
kind of grew up
in a park, uh, the woods.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.130
<i>And he's got a ton of fish</i>

16:06.132 --> 16:07.966
<i>so I thought maybe we could</i>
<i>all have dinner tonight.</i>

16:07.968 --> 16:09.634
Couldn't eat 'em all
if I wanted to.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.070
I mean, I could try, but..

16:12.072 --> 16:14.072
I just gotta
put a shirt on, alright?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.675
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yeah.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.643
So you were sayin'..

16:25.751 --> 16:27.852
- Jenn..
- Yeah?

16:27.854 --> 16:34.425
- Would you come help me here for a sec?
- Sure.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.994
- What's up?
- Come on in.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.362
Okay?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.833
What's goin' on?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.701
You comfortable with this?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.937
What? Him?

16:45.939 --> 16:48.039
Yeah, I don't know,
this guy could be..

16:48.041 --> 16:50.441
I was talkin' to him
for like 10 minutes. He's great.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.044
He's great. Hmm.
Well, he's a liar.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.712
- Why is he a liar?
- Woods?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.948
What the woods of Ireland?
Come on, come on.

16:56.950 --> 17:01.019
<i>What does that have to do</i>
<i>with anything?</i>

17:01.021 --> 17:02.286
Did you invite him
or he invited himself?

17:02.288 --> 17:03.921
I did.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.795
I can do that, I can do that. It'd
be really awkward, but I'll do it.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.031
You'd never be able
to do that. I know you.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.800
What do you need help with?

17:15.801 --> 17:17.068
I obviously don't need help.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.736
Oh, I guess it wasn't obvious
because..

17:18.738 --> 17:20.738
You told me to come in here.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.510
You know, I don't wanna
bother you all, so..

17:25.512 --> 17:28.378
Probably better if I just be on
my way and... have a nice trip.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.847
- Oh, no, no, no. Stay.
- No, no, no.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.582
No, no, no.
You're gonna stay..

17:31.584 --> 17:33.484
And you're gonna have
some dinner with us.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.253
- Yeah?
- Of course.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.735
Yeah, it was just, it was just
a misunderstanding, that's all.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.528
Well, alright, then.
Let's do it.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.530
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

18:02.614 --> 18:04.455
- You wanted fish.
- Mm-hmm.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.791
I thought it was illegal
to fish these lakes.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.728
Grandfather law.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.566
So that's when, like an, old law
applies to existing situations

18:21.568 --> 18:23.301
but then a new one applies
to all the future ones?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.236
I know what
a grandfather law is.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.972
Okay. Sorry.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.274
- Lawyer.
- Yeah, I got that.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.848
What about you, Alex?
What do you do?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.918
Well, um, right now I'm, uh..

18:40.920 --> 18:42.720
My buddy has
a landscaping business..

18:42.722 --> 18:45.890
So I'm... I'm working
with him.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.092
Are you Mexican?

18:48.094 --> 18:50.228
I didn't mean anything by that.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.731
I just thought that's a job
that the Mexicans do here.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.600
Well, what he does
is pretty high end.

18:55.602 --> 18:59.003
And actually he's starting
a new company soon, so..

18:59.005 --> 19:01.472
It's great.
He's really talented.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.207
Well done you, Alex.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.616
- Trout looks good.
- It does, right?

19:11.618 --> 19:14.619
Yeah, and lucky for me
if I cannot find any fish

19:14.621 --> 19:16.254
I got a license to kill a deer.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.089
Oh, cool.

19:18.091 --> 19:21.592
Fuck me tryin' to get
a license for that these days.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.828
You guys have anything we can
cook for sides with these?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.364
Yeah, you know, I could, um..

19:26.366 --> 19:28.266
Maybe fry the veggies
or potatoes?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.134
- Yeah, veggies sound good.
- Okay.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.537
Well, I say the potatoes.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.839
Why don't we do both?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.175
You know, Alex..

19:37.177 --> 19:38.910
Let's eat the potatoes.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.213
I'll get 'em.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.959
So you're Irish?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.227
County Tipperary.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.496
Is that near Mexico?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.798
That's a good one.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.066
Actually south of Dublin.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.169
What do you do
for a livin' out here?

20:05.171 --> 20:08.906
I give backcountry eco tours
to tourists that want, uh..

20:08.908 --> 20:10.875
You know like a deeper
experience of the wilderness

20:10.877 --> 20:14.412
you know, somethin' more than
campin' in a parking lot.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.980
Yeah? That's cool.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.748
I mean,
you and Jenn are doin' it

20:17.750 --> 20:20.251
so it must be cool, right?

20:20.253 --> 20:23.921
How much would
somethin' like that cost?

20:23.923 --> 20:25.489
I wouldn't know.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.486
You don't know
how much it costs?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.965
I only know how much
they pay me, Alex.

20:41.707 --> 20:45.443
Okay, so they're already parboiled, we
just need to put 'em on for a few minutes.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.279
Hang on.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.689
Oh, my..

21:02.294 --> 21:03.261
I'm sorry.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.862
Oh!

21:06.932 --> 21:08.733
Alright, then.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.535
Let's see what we've got here.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.771
- Uh, I can do that.
- No, I got it.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.874
This smells delicious.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.277
Yeah. There's, uh, garlic,
rosemary

21:19.279 --> 21:21.746
and there's some thyme.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.547
You're a luck man, Alex.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.849
I know.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.618
<i>So what are your plans?</i>

21:27.620 --> 21:30.488
You guys gonna do some amazing
hikes, see some spots, what?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.256
Uh, I think..

21:32.258 --> 21:34.325
You know, we live
really hectic lives

21:34.327 --> 21:36.494
so I think we're just gonna,
you know, relax.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.396
Stay around here
for a few days.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.664
Yep.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.499
Alright.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.035
You're really grabbin' life
by the balls, Alex, aren't ya?

21:46.104 --> 21:49.240
I'm just sayin'.
You know, if..

21:49.242 --> 21:51.776
If I had a beautiful woman
here like Jenn, I'd..

21:51.778 --> 21:53.811
<i>Wanna take her to some</i>
<i>spots that weren't on the..</i>

21:53.813 --> 21:56.080
The tourist trail, right?

21:56.082 --> 21:58.115
As a matter of fact, Jenn

21:58.117 --> 22:01.419
there is this absolutely
gorgeous waterfall

22:01.421 --> 22:03.354
I mean, really beautiful.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.522
<i>You've probably</i>
<i>been there, right, Alex?</i>

22:04.524 --> 22:06.324
Yeah, totally.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.825
Then you know which side
of the waterfall

22:07.827 --> 22:10.961
to climb down on.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.263
The right side.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.933
Right side.

22:18.437 --> 22:19.804
Good guess, Alex.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.139
I wasn't guessing.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.709
Oh, you see these tourists are always
tryin' to go down the left side.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.778
I mean, they think it's safer.
Fuckin' idiots!

22:27.780 --> 22:30.014
There's also a, uh..

22:30.016 --> 22:32.516
It's frozen... frozen arrow.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.885
- In Blackfoot Trail.
- Hmm.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.355
<i>I mean, if it were me..</i>

22:37.357 --> 22:40.658
I'd want to take you
to all those spots.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.527
You sure you don't
need a guide?

22:43.529 --> 22:45.262
I already have one.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.065
Let's eat.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.686
Alright.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.055
That was fun.
- Yeah, thanks for the fish.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.162
Alright.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.731
Well, now, I'm ready.
Cheers.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.066
Goodnight.

23:23.502 --> 23:24.735
Say, Alex..

23:25.837 --> 23:28.072
..you know, earlier..

23:28.074 --> 23:30.441
You said something.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.743
It was a misunderstanding.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.946
You wanna explain that to me?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.681
Uh, it was nothing.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.583
Come on, he's a big boy.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.852
Let him answer.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.922
It's just a funny thing to say.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.590
What'd you mean by it?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.759
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.528
Oh, yes, you do.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.099
What... was the misunderstanding?

24:02.541 --> 24:04.942
Is it important?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.744
I won't be fuckin' askin'
if it wasn't.

24:06.746 --> 24:07.945
It's on me, okay.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.627
- I was just...
- Jenn.

24:14.786 --> 24:18.155
Well, I come back here..

24:18.157 --> 24:20.358
And I find my girlfriend
talkin' to this guy..

24:22.227 --> 24:24.187
And I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.500
That's all.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.302
I mean, I don't know you.

24:32.904 --> 24:34.972
So what was
the misunderstanding?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.045
You can be some nut.

24:43.181 --> 24:45.182
She convinced me otherwise.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.489
Like I said, Alex..

24:55.827 --> 24:57.561
You're a lucky guy.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.634
I'm sorry.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.102
Jenn, I, uh..

25:06.338 --> 25:07.705
I think you dropped something.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.406
I got it.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.076
Thanks.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.790
Why don't you invite him to the
house next time. That'd be fun.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.526
I said I'm sorry.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.197
Should we worry about him?
- What's that?

25:33.199 --> 25:37.501
Should we worry about him
comin' back, or I don't know..

25:37.503 --> 25:39.470
No, he's just, he's just weird.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.476
But I'm bringing my axe.

25:45.478 --> 25:47.478
And I'm gonna sleep with it in
case your fuckin' dinner guest

25:47.480 --> 25:50.714
wants to come back for,
you know, dessert or something.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.449
You're mad.

25:55.186 --> 25:57.555
Jenn, I don't understand you.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.722
What?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.058
You invite a total stranger..

26:01.060 --> 26:03.327
To eat dinner with us
our first night on this trip.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.897
Okay, I... I didn't know
what to do.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.899
I was just being kind.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.170
I'm sorry.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.939
Just stay here.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.575
If he turns around
and comes back, you yell for me.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.282
Oh, my God.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.985
That smells amazing.

27:00.987 --> 27:01.986
Wow!

27:03.755 --> 27:05.322
Thank you.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.828
Remember the survey that we took
on the way over here?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.630
The first question was about
how many times

27:12.632 --> 27:15.332
your boyfriend has made
breakfast in bed for you?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.333
Remember that?
- Really?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.835
Yeah, and I had to write zero.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.738
Well, I guess I'll have to
change that from zero to one.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.239
- One, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.009
- Was it really zero?
- Yeah.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.644
- You embarrassed?
- Little bit.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.513
- This isn't even in bed...
- Believe me this counts.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.751
Thank you.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.190
What is it about this place
that's so amazing?

27:40.192 --> 27:41.925
- Blackfoot Trail?
- Yeah.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.927
Why's it called that anyway?

27:43.929 --> 27:46.196
Uh, the local tribes called it
that because when the trail ends

27:46.198 --> 27:48.532
it circles around
this really small lake.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.834
And the earth around
the lake is black.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.770
So when they hunted
they followed animal tracks

27:52.772 --> 27:55.339
in the black earth
and called it Blackfoot Trail.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.208
So what's the lake called?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.644
- I don't know.
- Seriously?

28:00.646 --> 28:03.681
No, no, no, picture it,
picture it, picture it, alright?

28:03.683 --> 28:05.883
You come up
this steep rocky trail

28:05.885 --> 28:07.718
and then all of a sudden
it levels off

28:07.720 --> 28:11.288
and it's this beautiful,
pristine lake.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.457
<i>When I was a kid</i>
<i>this was my favorite place</i>

28:13.459 --> 28:16.293
<i>in the whole world.</i>

28:16.295 --> 28:17.995
<i>Now it looks so out of place</i>
<i>that high up.</i>

28:17.997 --> 28:20.998
It's like out of some fantasy
novel or something, you know.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.701
Mmm. Yeah, I've a feeling your
geeky side is about to come out.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.803
- What geeky side?
- What geeky side?

28:25.805 --> 28:28.006
The one that made me watch
"Legend" four times.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.074
"Just wait for the part where Tom
Cruise is waiting by the lake

28:30.076 --> 28:31.542
for the big white unicorn
to come out."

28:31.544 --> 28:33.243
It's an awesome scene.
What are you talking about?

28:33.245 --> 28:34.965
- Yeah, indeed.
- Ha!

28:42.520 --> 28:43.887
All good?

28:44.989 --> 28:46.290
Yeah.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.708
Of course,
you're going that way.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.443
This is the way.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.131
Fuck.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.550
<i>Fuck.</i>

31:01.227 --> 31:02.960
Let me see it.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.233
Alex, it's disgusting.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.036
Ugh!

31:13.038 --> 31:14.538
It's pretty bad.

31:33.858 --> 31:35.826
- Oh, fuck!
- Are you ready?

31:39.998 --> 31:41.498
Sorry.

31:42.834 --> 31:43.901
That's not good.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.037
To think you're laughing
about it.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.906
Oh, why not?

31:53.078 --> 31:55.112
<i>Just don't touch the toe.</i>
<i>Don't touch the..</i>

31:55.114 --> 31:56.246
Here, let me... let me
finish it.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.781
It looks..

31:57.783 --> 32:01.184
- It looks terrible.
- It looks okay.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.546
- What you got there?
- You could use some new socks.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.758
- Stupid place.
- Oh, thanks, babes.

32:09.227 --> 32:10.193
<i>Okay.</i>

33:09.120 --> 33:10.187
Alex.

33:11.422 --> 33:12.389
Alex.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.334
Alex.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.335
Alex.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.437
Alex, get up.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.373
- Hmm?
- Listen.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.507
- What?
- Just listen.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.508
- Hmm?
- What is that?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.609
What?

33:34.712 --> 33:36.513
Someone's throwing shit
at our tent.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.181
What?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.316
Just listen.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.452
- What is that?
- That?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.622
Oh, that's acorns.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.891
Just fallin' from the trees
on our tent.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.813
It's fine.
Just go back to sleep.

34:02.473 --> 34:04.207
That's not an acorn.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.246
What is it?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.915
Do you think it's him?

34:11.917 --> 34:13.917
Let's just listen
for a bit, okay?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.668
Fuck! I swear,
now you got me all paranoid.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.937
Maybe he came back. He's throwing
stones at the tent or something stupid.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.899
No, no, no,
it could be anything.

34:41.279 --> 34:43.159
Well, whatever it is,
it stopped.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.784
So, let's just go back to sleep,
okay? It's fine.

34:49.887 --> 34:51.021
It stopped.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.551
That wasn't there last night,
was it?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.248
No.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.783
I wanna go home.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.353
Jenn, come on,
don't overreact, okay?

35:56.355 --> 35:59.623
An acorn did that?

35:59.625 --> 36:03.326
Oh, come on, I've waited
so long for this trip.

36:03.328 --> 36:07.998
We're here and when you get
there, you'll love it.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.102
I promise.

36:13.871 --> 36:16.139
Yeah, okay.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.276
- Can you do this for me?
- Yes.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.378
- Thank you.
- Alright.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.321
She's a very good artist. I have no
idea why you don't give her a chance.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.023
- What do you mean?
- And she's a great performer.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.659
Ah, you know,
it's just not my thing.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.894
- I don't...
- Oh, hey.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.896
Hang on a second.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.301
<i>What?</i>

36:50.174 --> 36:53.176
- This is wintergreen.
- Uh-huh.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.911
And you can eat this.

36:57.348 --> 37:00.383
Mm. Tastes like spearmint gum.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.418
- You want some?
- No.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.419
- You sure?
- Yes.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.661
An animal probably peed on it.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.256
<i>Your loss.</i>

37:09.727 --> 37:10.794
What's that smell?

37:23.074 --> 37:24.307
It's nothin'.

37:34.452 --> 37:35.452
Babe.

37:53.971 --> 37:55.972
Oh, my God. Alex!

37:59.410 --> 38:00.543
I mean, what..

38:08.919 --> 38:09.886
No.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.094
Oh, God. Get off me.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.100
Oh, my God.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.005
<i>I found it!</i>

39:02.007 --> 39:03.573
Thank God!

39:14.652 --> 39:15.819
Uh-oh!

39:18.222 --> 39:21.358
What is so funny?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.893
Looks like you have a little
piece of poo on your face.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.729
Yeah 'cause I just
fell down on it.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.998
- You fell? You okay?
- I'm fine.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Shouldn't we be saving that
or something?

39:31.002 --> 39:32.736
Ah, well, we've got plenty
of water at the lake.

39:32.738 --> 39:35.271
I brought the drops.
Here.

39:39.643 --> 39:42.245
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.981
- This is it?
- Yeah, just up there.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.217
It's a real <i> bitch</i> to get up,
isn't it?

39:47.219 --> 39:48.752
I know.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.720
But it's worth it.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.555
- Alright.
- Come on!

39:52.557 --> 39:54.591
- I'm comin'.
- Come on!

40:03.601 --> 40:05.101
Come on!

40:33.898 --> 40:34.864
Alex..

40:44.809 --> 40:47.210
<i>Where's the lake?</i>

40:47.212 --> 40:49.078
I can't believe this.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.447
- Alex..
- I don't..

40:50.449 --> 40:52.882
- I don't understand.
- This can't be it, right?

40:52.884 --> 40:56.052
Fuck! I was sure. I was like
a fucking 100% sure. I was..

40:56.054 --> 40:57.654
- <i> Can you look at me, please?</i>
- Just let me think.

40:57.656 --> 41:00.156
Just let me think.
Let me think. Let me think.

41:01.559 --> 41:04.294
Fuck! God damn it!
What the fuck is this?

41:09.233 --> 41:11.401
Please tell me
you have a map in your bag.

41:11.403 --> 41:14.237
- I never needed a map.
- Oh, we do now.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.039
I don't have one.

41:17.074 --> 41:18.475
So, then, where are we?

41:18.477 --> 41:20.009
I obviously don't know, right?

41:20.011 --> 41:23.313
But you said that you've
done this, like, so many times

41:23.315 --> 41:25.582
You said it was, like,
a few years ago you did this.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.684
Yeah, I've been to the park
a bunch of times!

41:27.686 --> 41:30.653
The trail, Alex.
You said you did the trail.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.721
Yeah.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.824
Not since high school, but..

41:46.136 --> 41:48.238
- <i>It's not, uh..</i>
- <i> I've put it here. I..</i>

41:49.039 --> 41:51.040
I put it right here.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.247
It's not, uh..

41:59.850 --> 42:00.817
I took it out.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.719
What?

42:02.721 --> 42:04.487
Your phone.

42:04.489 --> 42:06.789
I took it out.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.158
Where is it?

42:09.160 --> 42:11.794
- In the car.
- Why would you do that?

42:11.796 --> 42:13.696
I didn't want you on that thing

42:13.698 --> 42:16.032
the whole time when we're here.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.734
I didn't reach for that once.

42:17.736 --> 42:20.637
I... I wanted to bring it
in case we needed it.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.906
Which we do.

42:22.908 --> 42:24.474
<i>You can't get reception</i>
<i>out here anyway...</i>

42:24.476 --> 42:26.396
Well, I would have
loved to try.

42:40.024 --> 42:43.826
When was the last time you were
sure of where you were?

42:43.828 --> 42:46.896
- I was sure the whole time.
- <i> No. Think, Alex.</i>

42:47.765 --> 42:49.332
<i>When was it?</i>

42:51.702 --> 42:52.936
I don't..

42:54.038 --> 42:56.406
Maybe the fork in the trail

42:56.408 --> 42:58.288
The first one, the second one?

43:04.014 --> 43:05.348
First one.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.451
Are you serious?

43:08.453 --> 43:09.519
<i>Just... come on,</i>
<i>don't freak out.</i>

43:09.521 --> 43:11.421
I don't want to be
freaking out right now.

43:11.423 --> 43:14.591
But we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.726
We don't have anything. We don't
have a... we don't have a map.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.728
We don't have a cell phone.
We don't have anything.

43:18.730 --> 43:21.397
We haven't seen anyone
in so long!

43:21.399 --> 43:23.299
- <i>This is... it's okay.</i>
- Why..

43:23.301 --> 43:26.436
Why did we have to come so far
on my first camping trip?

43:26.438 --> 43:28.571
Why couldn't it just have been
a regular trip?

43:28.573 --> 43:30.139
Why do you always
have to show off.

43:30.141 --> 43:31.474
- I'm not showing off...
- <i> Or something.</i>

43:31.476 --> 43:32.875
<i>Why do you always</i>
<i>try to impress me?</i>

43:32.877 --> 43:35.211
<i>Look, 'cause I'm not</i>
<i>fucking impressed right now!</i>

43:35.213 --> 43:37.480
Good!

43:37.482 --> 43:38.748
I'm not trying
to fucking impress you!

43:38.750 --> 43:41.117
Alex, could we
be honest for a second?

43:41.119 --> 43:42.960
I'd love to be honest for once.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.623
I wish I never came.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.591
This whole thing was a mistake.

43:48.593 --> 43:49.759
- Okay?
- <i> Come on, Jenn, don't...</i>

43:49.761 --> 43:51.928
And we should be
going home tomorrow.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.796
But you fucked it up.

43:53.798 --> 43:56.332
You always fuck it all up.
You're such a fucking loser.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.240
The stupid lake!
Why did we have to come here?

44:04.242 --> 44:06.209
I don't even care why.

44:11.415 --> 44:12.382
Why?

44:14.151 --> 44:15.885
I was gonna propose to you.

44:19.790 --> 44:20.757
God!

45:20.017 --> 45:21.250
I'm really sorry.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.124
I had no idea.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.003
It's okay.

45:41.005 --> 45:43.506
Umm, we should
probably make camp.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.879
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:49.881 --> 45:50.913
Sounds good.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.018
Was that a..

48:42.020 --> 48:43.452
No, no, no, no.
It was a raccoon.

48:43.454 --> 48:44.854
Look, you can tell me
the truth.

48:44.856 --> 48:46.896
No, I saw the little shit
last night.

48:54.198 --> 48:55.531
Shit.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.242
<i>Is this right?</i>

49:06.244 --> 49:09.412
Yeah. We just need to take a
turn at that overgrown trail.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.547
Didn't seem this far down.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.390
No, we're good.
We're good.

49:14.084 --> 49:15.151
Watch your step.

49:15.153 --> 49:16.619
Watch your step there.

49:38.342 --> 49:39.909
Sh... shit.

49:39.911 --> 49:44.246
Should we go back?

49:44.248 --> 49:46.816
I don't know.

49:46.818 --> 49:51.854
What are the chances this
leading to something?

49:51.856 --> 49:53.322
Pretty good.
Right, it's provincial park.

49:53.324 --> 49:54.924
It's gotta lead somewhere.

50:36.533 --> 50:37.800
Here.

50:40.504 --> 50:42.671
Thank you.

50:48.245 --> 50:49.545
What is that?

50:57.320 --> 50:59.321
Bear bed.

51:02.592 --> 51:03.659
Okay.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.863
Okay.

51:07.865 --> 51:10.366
Let's go as far as
we can before dark.

51:10.368 --> 51:12.935
Right?

51:12.937 --> 51:15.871
Come on.

51:15.873 --> 51:16.939
Let's go, Alex.

51:41.698 --> 51:42.765
I'm so sorry.

51:48.738 --> 51:50.940
Did you mean those
things you said?

51:52.609 --> 51:54.176
No, I didn't.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.747
'Cause, Jenn, I mean if
that's what you feel abo...

51:58.749 --> 52:00.316
No.

52:04.321 --> 52:07.389
I should have never said that.

52:07.391 --> 52:08.891
I was just really mad.

52:11.094 --> 52:12.828
I'm sorry.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.533
I love you.

52:21.605 --> 52:22.838
Do you wanna see it?

52:24.741 --> 52:25.908
The ring?

52:26.510 --> 52:27.910
<i>Yeah.</i>

52:29.946 --> 52:31.514
If you want to.

52:46.163 --> 52:49.765
No, no, no, no, don't.
No. Actually, just..

52:51.168 --> 52:52.868
Wait.

52:57.207 --> 52:58.340
Okay.

53:06.650 --> 53:08.617
So hungry.

53:10.554 --> 53:15.257
I think I... I think I have
half a protein bar left in here.

53:17.127 --> 53:21.330
And this is all we have?
This is it?

53:21.332 --> 53:22.398
Yeah.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.501
Oh, wait a second.

53:25.503 --> 53:26.969
Except for, uh..

53:33.577 --> 53:36.078
- Mm-mm.
- Ta-da.

53:36.080 --> 53:39.348
Come on. Really?

53:39.350 --> 53:41.350
Yeah.

53:41.352 --> 53:45.721
- You want some?
- Yeah.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.157
Ooh, straight top.

53:52.395 --> 53:54.663
You first.

53:54.665 --> 53:58.067
Okay.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.101
To us.

54:00.503 --> 54:01.971
To us.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.877
Mm, that is so good.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.579
Have some. It's great.

54:15.452 --> 54:16.585
That is good.

54:23.627 --> 54:24.994
I know this sucks.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.764
Could be worse.

54:28.766 --> 54:31.533
<i>How is that?</i>

54:31.535 --> 54:32.695
At least we're together.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.175
I mean it.

54:48.151 --> 54:49.218
Come here.

55:28.758 --> 55:29.825
What is that, Alex?

55:30.927 --> 55:33.429
I don't know.

55:41.304 --> 55:43.339
Alex, do you think it's a bear?

55:45.809 --> 55:46.809
Hey!

56:02.125 --> 56:03.692
<i>Is it gone?</i>

56:03.694 --> 56:05.127
Let's get back in the tent.

56:05.129 --> 56:06.362
Okay.

56:07.731 --> 56:09.031
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

56:31.488 --> 56:34.022
It's okay.

56:34.024 --> 56:37.326
We scared it off.
We're good.

56:37.328 --> 56:38.994
Okay? We're good.

57:14.798 --> 57:16.799
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:18.134 --> 57:20.469
So, I was thinking..

57:20.471 --> 57:22.871
That I should phone
down in the front desk

57:22.873 --> 57:24.907
and order us some room service.

57:24.909 --> 57:26.175
Maybe a couples massage?

57:32.615 --> 57:33.949
Deep tissues.

57:39.155 --> 57:41.156
We're gonna be okay.

57:43.226 --> 57:44.226
I know.

57:52.235 --> 57:54.275
- We should get going, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

58:10.254 --> 58:12.454
<i>What? Alex.</i>

58:12.456 --> 58:14.323
Shh.

58:14.325 --> 58:17.960
- <i> What?</i>
- Stay quiet.

58:17.962 --> 58:22.531
- You're scaring me. What?
- <i> Stay quiet. Stay quiet.</i>

58:22.533 --> 58:23.932
Did he come back?

58:24.934 --> 58:26.435
Shh.

58:30.006 --> 58:33.775
<i>What the fuck is he doing?</i>

58:33.777 --> 58:35.777
What the fuck is he doing?

58:42.285 --> 58:43.719
Did it come back?
Is it outside?

58:43.721 --> 58:45.454
Yeah.

58:45.456 --> 58:47.055
Shh.

58:52.395 --> 58:54.796
Please move on. Please
move on. Please move on.

58:54.798 --> 58:57.566
<i>Please move on. Please</i>
<i>move on. Please move on.</i>

58:57.568 --> 58:59.735
<i>Please move on. Please</i>
<i>move on. Please move on.</i>

58:59.737 --> 59:01.103
Please move on.

59:13.016 --> 59:14.583
- Oh, fuck!
- <i> What?</i>

59:14.585 --> 59:15.918
Fuck! Fuck!

59:15.920 --> 59:18.020
Is it out there?
Did it come back?

59:18.022 --> 59:19.555
<i>What do we do? We don't</i>
<i>even have food in here.</i>

59:19.557 --> 59:21.924
I know. Where's my axe?

59:25.895 --> 59:27.095
What the fuck! Where's my axe?

59:27.097 --> 59:29.364
You put in your bag?

59:29.366 --> 59:31.233
I left my bag by the fire.

59:33.670 --> 59:35.504
I cannot believe
this is happening.

59:35.506 --> 59:37.172
What do we do?

59:37.174 --> 59:38.840
What do we do?

59:38.842 --> 59:42.010
We don't even have
food in here.

59:42.012 --> 59:43.378
Alex.

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.905
Alex!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:47.976
Get behind me.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.411
Get behind me.

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:56.952
Get the fuck out!

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:58.186
Just get out!

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.163
<i>Spray it!</i>

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.778
- I'm gonna wrap it.
- Ah.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.646
- I know, just..
- Ah!

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.851
<i>Okay. Okay, okay.</i>

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.288
It's okay. It's okay.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.623
<i>I'm gonna wrap it.</i>

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.330
- It's okay.
- Jenn.

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:43.198
<i>Jenn, I can't feel my foot.</i>

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.399
It's okay.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:50.639
It's okay. It's okay.

01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:51.707
I can't feel my foot.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:55.343
We're gonna crawl out of here
if we have to. You hear me?

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.312
My God!
I'm gonna fucking die out here!

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.047
- No, you're not!
- I'm gonna fucking die!

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.416
Alex! You're fine!

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.585
Alex, you're gonna be fine.
