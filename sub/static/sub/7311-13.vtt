00:02.719 --> 00:05.066
I wish I could stay, but I have to fly.

00:05.090 --> 00:08.660
Oh, no. That's terrible!
You actually said it.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.566
I thought I was gonna ruin the
moment by saying the wrong thing.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.066
What could you possibly say?

00:14.090 --> 00:17.580
I don't know. Anything
involving the word layover.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.796
- Okay...
- Okay.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.820
All right.

00:36.990 --> 00:41.286
I can't believe you did
this to me. I love you.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.420
And you stabbed me in the back.

00:46.650 --> 00:49.610
At least I looked you in the eyes.

00:51.410 --> 00:54.240
Oh, Cheryl...

01:03.400 --> 01:07.480
Is he okay? Is he all right?

NCIS Season06
Episode13 Broken Bird.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.236
What could it be for McGee?

01:42.260 --> 01:44.036
Cookies.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.226
Those would have to
be some huge cookies.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.016
Care package from home.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.470
Winter clothes? Mittens?

01:52.850 --> 01:54.970
Too heavy.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.726
I'm bored; I don't want to play anymore.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.036
I don't care.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.840
- Well, I am opening it.
- Thank God.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.226
Oh, goody, they're here.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.180
Goody? Who says goody?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.460
What is it?

02:11.930 --> 02:14.626
This is my Mac SE.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.576
Got it for my eleventh birthday.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.400
She is my first.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.856
This is going to get
really strange, isn't it?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.420
Going to?

02:22.450 --> 02:25.146
These are chapters of my life.

02:25.170 --> 02:29.810
From the earliest discovery
to that palpable connection

02:31.060 --> 02:34.556
and the eventual
evolution. Look at this.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.816
Here I am making the transition to PC.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.466
I'll alert the Smithsonian.

02:39.490 --> 02:44.966
Maybe they can make a space for your exhibit...
"The Chronicles of a Teenage Shut-in."

02:44.990 --> 02:46.470
How do you rember your childhood?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.896
Vaguely.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.596
You have no sense of history.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.186
I do.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.666
And so does Petty Officer Kevin Lim.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.126
He's history?

02:55.150 --> 02:57.706
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

02:57.730 --> 03:00.760
Grab your mittens. It's cold out there.

03:03.990 --> 03:09.540
I forgot my passport, I came
back, and I saw that he was, uh...

03:12.170 --> 03:13.626
You didn't see who did it?

03:13.650 --> 03:15.866
I didn't have to.

03:15.890 --> 03:18.796
It was Cheryl, his ex-fianc√©e.

03:18.820 --> 03:20.836
The engagement was just broken off.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.556
I need to take your statement.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.176
- All right.
- Okay.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.056
Here, let's go inside for some privacy.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.696
Boss, got an eyewitness who saw a woman with
blood on her hands headed around the corner.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.726
Not the stewardess.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.276
Doesn't fit the flight
attendant's description.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.660
The ex. Canvass.

03:36.090 --> 03:41.476
The reason I missed "I" Street is because I was
expecting to find "I" Street two blocks past "K" Street.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.466
It is a rare place in this world, Mr.
Palmer, where reason is the best compass.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.636
Miss the turn?

03:47.660 --> 03:49.746
H, I, J, K. That's how the
alphabet works, right?

03:49.770 --> 03:51.616
Goes the same forwards as backwards.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.810
In Hebrew, there is no J.

03:54.170 --> 03:57.706
Apart from the name of the food
court at George Washington University,

03:57.730 --> 04:00.266
there is no J Street in the District.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.856
Perhaps that's where you've been
spending your time, Mr. Palmer,

04:02.880 --> 04:04.426
instead of going to class.

04:04.450 --> 04:08.116
I suppose that's further evidence of my
lesser education that I did not know that.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.756
The fault lies not with the institute
of higher learning, Mr. Palmer,

04:11.780 --> 04:14.400
but with your observational skills.

04:14.430 --> 04:18.916
In 1791, a Parisian,
Pierre Charles L'Enfant,

04:18.940 --> 04:21.005
was commissioned to design a city plan.

04:21.029 --> 04:21.906
Okay, here we go.

04:21.930 --> 04:24.460
The Capitol is at the center.

04:24.490 --> 04:28.696
Four quadrants radiate
northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.506
The north-south streets are numbered, the
east-west streets are lettered.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.646
When the alphabet is
exhausted, they go syllabically.

04:35.670 --> 04:39.026
First, two syllables, then, three
syllables. Macomb is followed by Newark...

04:39.050 --> 04:41.476
And Albemarle is followed by Brandywine.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.986
I understand, Doctor.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.746
I failed one class.

04:44.770 --> 04:46.736
That doesn't make me a bad student.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.530
So then, why is there no J Street?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.816
Sorry.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.706
13th and I.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.570
One block north, two blocks east.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.686
Need you here, Ziva.

04:56.710 --> 05:00.040
Thirteenth and L. Be right there, Gibbs.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.296
I will make up the class.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.186
Maintain the scene.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.490
Make it up to me right now.

05:07.050 --> 05:09.580
- Really?
- Yeah. Come on.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.426
Got her!

05:25.450 --> 05:28.400
Stand up! Show me your hands!

05:33.660 --> 05:35.750
Hands behind your back.

05:37.630 --> 05:41.246
Upward angle of the trajectory
likely severed the abdominal aorta.

05:41.270 --> 05:44.496
The shape indicates
a clockwise twisting.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.296
The assailant was
probably right-handed.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.080
Refrain from conjecture.

05:49.870 --> 05:52.646
Exsanguination lead to death.

05:52.670 --> 05:57.026
Judging by the diameter of the pooling, I'd
say he bled out within, uh, three minutes.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.126
Cold surface expedites coagulation.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.276
Perhaps four.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.686
Why is there no J Street?

06:03.710 --> 06:05.496
I just told you, I don't know.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.300
And I just gave you
a clue to the answer.

06:10.790 --> 06:15.730
We are discussing the construction of the very
streets where democracy would stride freely.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.626
Excuse me. Sorry. That's a nice hat.

06:18.650 --> 06:20.656
Excuse me. Sorry.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.686
So, uh, is that her?

06:22.710 --> 06:25.056
- Yeah, quickest case ever.
- Yeah, sets a new record.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.620
Out of the way. Nothing
to see here, folks.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.296
This was the transformation of so much.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.266
It was the bedrock of
the most lofty ideals.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.786
These were not idle
decisions, Mr. Palmer.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.540
Even in 1791...

06:40.970 --> 06:43.550
Doctor, look out! Look out!

06:43.990 --> 06:47.530
Doctor!

06:50.830 --> 06:52.446
- Doctor!
- Get her!

06:52.470 --> 06:54.646
Stop her! Stop her!

06:54.670 --> 06:56.810
- Hold her.
- Got her. Got her.

06:58.790 --> 07:02.640
That way! She's wearing a
green scarf covering her face!

07:05.900 --> 07:08.270
Ducky...

07:18.230 --> 07:19.830
Stay still, Duck.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.346
I'm all right, Jethro.

07:22.370 --> 07:27.350
It's just a... defensive wound.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.986
Portable X-ray to 256 North.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.090
Jimmy.

07:41.390 --> 07:42.986
How is Ducky?

07:43.010 --> 07:47.526
Multiple superficial lacerations, plus the
blade finally embedded in the midpalmar space,

07:47.550 --> 07:51.980
possibly damaging or even severing
flexor tendons and lumbrical muscles.

07:52.010 --> 07:55.576
Best-case scenario entails
weeks of physical therapy, uh,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.646
after reconstructive surgery.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.066
He should be out any second now, so...

08:00.090 --> 08:03.656
So the short answer is, he's alive.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.856
What? Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.496
Because when you hear, "Ducky got stabbed," you
don't necessarily take that part for granted.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.146
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.266
It's okay.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.356
You are very, uh, calm.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.666
I am.

08:20.690 --> 08:24.756
If I keep going to Crazytown
every time one of you gets hurt,

08:24.780 --> 08:27.950
I'm gonna have to
have my mail forwarded.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.916
Ducky.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.775
Abby? How kind of you to visit.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.836
Oh, they gave you morphine.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.176
Well, just a drop.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.919
Duck, anything you
remember about the attack?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.660
My-my glasses.

08:49.050 --> 08:53.316
Sweetie, you held on to them for
me while I went under the knife.

08:53.340 --> 08:57.546
It's ironic that the solution
to one knife should be...

08:57.570 --> 09:01.076
Mr. Palmer, would... would you,
uh, finish that thought for me?

09:01.100 --> 09:02.370
Sure, Doctor.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.476
Oh, and you need to send
for a substitute M.E.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.816
Uh, Jordan...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.336
Uh, Dr. Hampton?

09:10.360 --> 09:13.216
Yeah. On my desk you'll find her number,

09:13.240 --> 09:17.370
while I myself lay here
getting much numb-er.

09:17.910 --> 09:20.106
Nurse, more anesthetic!

09:20.130 --> 09:23.246
And don't spare the horses.

09:23.270 --> 09:27.276
Okay, he's zonked out of his gourd,
and he's still playing with words.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.746
Impressive.

09:28.770 --> 09:31.680
Abs... weapon, prints.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.656
How am I supposed to log this?

09:33.680 --> 09:38.970
Because technically, it's the weapon
of interest in two separate cases.

09:40.670 --> 09:43.280
I'll figure it out.

09:53.230 --> 09:56.776
One of the residents captured the
actual attack on their camera phone?

09:56.800 --> 10:02.040
Neighbors seem to think a crime scene makes
better watching than, uh, daytime television.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.520
Quality isn't great.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.780
Let me see if I can clean this up a bit.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.216
Doctor?

10:10.240 --> 10:12.640
Stop her. Stop her!

10:18.630 --> 10:21.456
She's what, approximately
five-foot, three?

10:21.480 --> 10:24.336
- Mid.
- To late thirties. She's wearing a hijab.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.500
Likely Muslim.

10:25.530 --> 10:28.040
All right, this should do it.

10:36.690 --> 10:39.706
Sounds like Pashtun or Dari.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.836
Might be a regional Afghani dialect.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.880
We can get a linguist on it.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.890
So... you're dead. Sorry about that.

10:50.970 --> 10:53.350
Poor... fellow.

10:53.750 --> 10:59.140
You know, if it's any consolation, all
indications are that you went out...

11:00.170 --> 11:02.660
with a bang.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.100
Oh, forget it.

11:07.810 --> 11:10.286
- Dr. Hampton.
- Jim.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.646
Oh, you prefer Jimmy.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.266
Jim Palmer was a
pitcher for the Orioles.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.130
I was named after him, but...

11:17.160 --> 11:20.906
I have never really liked baseball.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.056
Noted.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.636
Well, please, you may call me Jordan.

11:24.660 --> 11:29.420
I was named after a body of water
towards which I bear no ill will.

11:29.710 --> 11:33.466
Why would Dr. Mallard need a last
minute fill-in? It seems very unlike him.

11:33.490 --> 11:36.110
Oh, he was assaulted at a crime scene.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.750
H-He'll be okay. His hand was injured.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.446
Scary.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.896
I suppose we can be his hands for today.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.370
The facts of this case
are pretty cut-and-dry.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.400
Jordan?

11:59.020 --> 12:00.296
You okay?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.420
Yes, fine.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.420
Let's get started. Thank you.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.656
Talk to me, baby, talk to me.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.676
Fingerprint sheet.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.430
I was, I was talking to the knife.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.936
- You want to talk knives?
- Always.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.836
What we have here is
a SliceCo chef knife.

12:19.860 --> 12:23.416
It's a standard part of the 12-piece
introductory counter block kitchen set.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.456
It's laser-beveled titanium
steel rust-resistant blade,

12:26.480 --> 12:29.630
and the tang extends the full length
of the engineered thermo-resin handle,

12:29.660 --> 12:33.610
which will not crack, chip,
fade, or absorb any material.

12:33.910 --> 12:38.126
It will, however, retain
a print on a bloody smear.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.796
Or in this case, many prints.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.216
Summer job?

12:42.240 --> 12:44.856
Yeah, telemarketing, sophomore year.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.550
It helps if you believe in the products.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.666
These are actually really good knives.

12:48.690 --> 12:50.856
The handle has been
handled by many hands,

12:50.880 --> 12:54.516
so it's going to take some hunting and
pecking to isolate Ducky's attacker.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.806
What about the hijab?

12:55.830 --> 12:57.626
I pulled some hair from it.

12:57.650 --> 13:00.716
The fabric is quite old, handmade.

13:00.740 --> 13:02.676
So it fell off when
you were chasing her?

13:02.700 --> 13:03.770
Mm, unlikely.

13:03.810 --> 13:06.106
It is designed to always
stay on as a sign of modesty.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.446
She would not just lose it by accident.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.930
She was trying to
disappear in plain sight.

13:15.870 --> 13:19.100
- Yeah.
- Ziva, hey. The linguist has a translation.

13:20.290 --> 13:22.160
On my way.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.796
Are you sure this is right?

13:26.820 --> 13:29.220
That's what she said, boss.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.596
Three decades ago, in my RAMC days,

13:39.620 --> 13:43.270
I was seconded to an
American tank regiment.

13:44.110 --> 13:48.580
Hand injuries were prevalent
in the Armored Cavalry.

13:48.620 --> 13:54.640
As a result, I considered
making hand surgery my specialty.

13:55.830 --> 14:01.330
Fortunately, I opted for a
less-sensitive clientele.

14:01.360 --> 14:05.990
Otherwise, this might
spell an end to my career.

14:09.210 --> 14:14.100
"Sab "ann muredaha toostee."

14:15.910 --> 14:18.340
"Dari." Means...

14:18.660 --> 14:21.080
"Bringer of death."

14:22.360 --> 14:24.776
Picked up a few words, did you, Duck?

14:24.800 --> 14:29.200
Your old RAMC days in Afghanistan?

14:29.490 --> 14:31.420
I don't want to talk about it.

14:31.450 --> 14:36.050
Yeah, well, the next phrase she yells
means: "You killed my brother."

14:41.220 --> 14:44.316
Any idea why she would have said that?

14:44.340 --> 14:48.060
Perhaps because I killed her brother.

15:04.310 --> 15:06.666
We have found her, Gibbs. The
woman's name is Mosuma Daoub.

15:06.690 --> 15:07.786
Put her in interrogation.

15:07.810 --> 15:08.976
She's not actually here.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.896
What Ziva meant to say is we've
I.D.'d her. Fingerprint match.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.490
Throw it up, McGarnagle.

15:13.950 --> 15:18.180
Mosuma Daoub... Afghani immigrant,
married to Ezmaray Daoub, two children.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.066
That's their home address.

15:19.090 --> 15:22.196
According to her tax returns, she works
at a flower shop in the neighborhood

15:22.220 --> 15:23.386
where the attack took place.

15:23.410 --> 15:26.000
Her boss says she hasn't been
seen since yesterday morning.

15:26.030 --> 15:29.276
She went out for coffee, stuck a
knife in Ducky, and never came back.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.106
Pick her up at home.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.600
She has not returned home.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.396
According to her husband,
he doesn't know where she is.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.550
Then bringhimin here.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.316
McGee, I want to ask you something.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.636
The director's still in
budget allocation meetings?

15:43.660 --> 15:44.946
Yeah, he's gone till the end of the week.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.446
Well, I need a personnel file.

15:47.470 --> 15:49.656
It can't wait.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.466
Well, I could access that without
disturbing the director. Who?

15:54.490 --> 15:57.430
Dr. Donald Mallard.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.686
Mr. Daoub, you have not
heard from your wife?

16:03.710 --> 16:06.136
I leave her messages.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.230
I call her friends.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.630
I have been trying not
to panic the children,

16:10.660 --> 16:13.556
but I was so nervous when
I dropped them at school...

16:13.580 --> 16:17.690
I forgot to give them their lunches.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.730
Can you identify your wife's hijab?

16:24.350 --> 16:27.636
Hijab? You mean her scarf.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.390
We are not so traditional.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.976
Where did you find it?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.180
Near her work.

16:34.950 --> 16:39.020
What could have happened that
she would not call me back?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.360
We will find out.

16:45.930 --> 16:48.070
Cell records for Mosuma Daoub.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.416
Any record of her calling
home since yesterday?

16:50.440 --> 16:51.756
Negative.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.226
Mr. Mom's story checks out.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.676
Only calls she made were to the embassy.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.800
Which embassy?

17:02.320 --> 17:07.736
Afghanistan... a country with a
fascinating and tumultuous history.

17:07.760 --> 17:13.175
Ruled over the centuries by
Kushans, Mongols, Pushtans, Persians,

17:13.200 --> 17:19.215
and a series of tribal leaders where
succession was often by assassination.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.915
The Soviets tried
their hand for a while.

17:22.940 --> 17:26.986
They were opposed by the mujahideen,

17:27.010 --> 17:30.650
who naturally were
supported by U.S.and Britain,

17:30.680 --> 17:33.996
and out of that mess
emerged the Taliban,

17:34.020 --> 17:38.826
with their rigid
interpretation of Islam.

17:38.850 --> 17:44.260
It was they who finally destroyed the ancient
statues of Buddha in the Bamiyan Valley.

17:44.300 --> 17:47.936
I was with the Royal Army Medical Corps

17:47.960 --> 17:53.436
when a notice went up in the
officers' mess asking for volunteers

17:53.460 --> 17:58.400
for a refugee camp on
the Pakistan border.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.440
I was such a kid back then.

18:01.850 --> 18:04.576
Full of ideology.

18:04.600 --> 18:09.016
I wanted to go somewhere
where I would do the most good,

18:09.040 --> 18:11.656
where my skills would be appreciated.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.856
I was also rather entangled
with a possessive German female.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.860
Olga. Was an easy way to cut loose.

18:20.620 --> 18:24.630
But of course you're too much of a
gentleman to speak of your old flame.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.596
Yes, well, right now, I'm
concerned in producing a new one.

18:28.620 --> 18:32.440
- I'll do it.
- Thank you. Most kind.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.560
Oh, my!

18:36.580 --> 18:39.040
There's a bird in the house.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.010
Someday they're going to put a plaque
on this bench with both our names, Gibbs.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.760
Mr. Kort.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.460
Agency's keeping you local.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.766
Travel is touchy at the moment.

19:14.790 --> 19:18.996
I made a few enemies overseas.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.436
What, with your winning personality?

19:21.460 --> 19:24.750
When you finally open that
charm school, let me know.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.030
I need a favor.

19:29.980 --> 19:33.406
But Gibbs, I don't like you.

19:33.430 --> 19:36.190
That's okay, I don't like you either.

19:36.230 --> 19:39.046
Not trading on kindness.

19:39.070 --> 19:41.830
But we are trading.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.566
CIA aided the mujahideen
resistance against the Soviets.

19:46.590 --> 19:48.566
The '80s?

19:48.590 --> 19:52.270
I was running track at
Oxford, not covert missions.

19:52.970 --> 19:55.080
Dig.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.450
Where?

19:57.480 --> 20:01.366
Jalozai Refugee Camp,
Pakistani border, summer 1980.

20:01.390 --> 20:03.736
Whatever you got.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.620
This is going to cost you, Gibbs.

20:13.670 --> 20:17.016
You are the American NCIS agents?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.916
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

20:18.940 --> 20:20.246
Ziva David.

20:20.270 --> 20:21.716
I am Qasim Saydia.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.890
Got any idea what goes on
around here, Mr. Saydia?

20:26.180 --> 20:28.576
- I believe that I do.
- Great.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.226
It would be really helpful if
you knew about Mosuma Daoub.

20:32.250 --> 20:36.210
Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll
have to speak to your superiors.

20:36.980 --> 20:41.596
Yes, well, that will require quite a
lengthy plane flight, Agent DiNozzo.

20:41.620 --> 20:42.976
Tony, he is the ambassador.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.116
I apologize.

20:44.140 --> 20:46.946
So you know what goes on
around here. Where is she?

20:46.970 --> 20:49.890
Mosuma Daoub is in this building.

20:50.430 --> 20:52.766
She stabbed a man on an
American street yesterday.

20:52.790 --> 20:54.946
She explained this to me.

20:54.970 --> 20:58.006
However, she is under the protection
of the government of Afghanistan

20:58.030 --> 21:01.926
until we can investigate
these accusations.

21:01.950 --> 21:04.576
Sir, since when has she
been under your protection?

21:04.600 --> 21:06.486
We only just made these accusations.

21:06.510 --> 21:09.866
I'm not referring to the
accusations against her;

21:09.890 --> 21:14.126
Rather, the accusations she has
made against your Dr. Mallard.

21:14.150 --> 21:15.286
Excuse me?

21:15.310 --> 21:18.086
She admitted that she lost
control of her senses for a moment,

21:18.110 --> 21:21.306
when she recognized him,
but I can hardly blame her.

21:21.330 --> 21:25.376
From what she has told
me, this man is a villain.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.490
What exactly did she tell you?

21:30.070 --> 21:34.180
That Dr. Mallard violated Article
4 of the Geneva Convention.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.900
War crimes?

21:37.990 --> 21:39.980
Ducky?

21:46.680 --> 21:51.696
Article 4 of the Geneva Convention prohibits
the use of violence against noncombatants.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.466
Ducky's not a war criminal.

21:53.490 --> 21:54.796
That woman is lying.

21:54.820 --> 21:59.296
We won't know the details until formal
charges are filed with the State Department.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.676
Then everyone will know.

22:00.700 --> 22:06.656
Ambassador Saydia said it involved events that took
place at Jalozai Refugee Camp almost 30 years ago.

22:06.680 --> 22:10.406
Which would make Mosuma Daoub
like eight years old at the time.

22:10.430 --> 22:14.260
So, this woman is walking down the
street, minding her own business,

22:14.290 --> 22:17.790
sees Ducky, someone she hasn't
seen since she was a little girl,

22:17.820 --> 22:20.666
and is suddenly overcome with
the urge to stick a knife in him?

22:20.690 --> 22:21.850
She was hiding.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.590
Her husband said she never wore
her hijab covering her face.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.586
I mean, that shows premeditation.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.476
Spitting distance from the Navy Yard.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.700
She could have known
Ducky would be there.

22:30.730 --> 22:32.866
She's not so innocent.

22:32.890 --> 22:36.636
Okay, let's figure out how and when Mosuma
could have seen Ducky in the neighborhood

22:36.660 --> 22:38.446
and how she'd know
he'd be on the street.

22:38.470 --> 22:40.480
Re-canvass, reinterview, reexamine.

22:40.510 --> 22:42.040
Why are you talking so fast?

22:42.070 --> 22:44.746
Want to get a plan of attack together,
'cause according to my internal Gibbs clock,

22:44.770 --> 22:48.200
he's about to walk through
that door right... now.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.940
Now.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.170
Somebody's clock is off.

23:07.450 --> 23:11.760
Hope Dr. Mallard knows how
good a friend you are to him.

23:12.150 --> 23:14.110
Two-way street, Trent.

23:14.180 --> 23:18.306
I don't think they ever clean anything
out of the archives at Langley.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.890
I had to go through
100 boxes to find that.

23:24.910 --> 23:30.506
An old instructor... not one of my
favorites... was at the Jalozai camp.

23:30.530 --> 23:33.790
I opted not to call
in a favor of my own.

23:33.820 --> 23:37.240
Prefer to stockpile
those for a rainy day.

23:37.770 --> 23:39.236
I'm good for it.

23:39.260 --> 23:40.940
No doubt.

23:40.970 --> 23:46.900
Can't help but notice these same ends could have been
reached with one call from your director to mine.

23:47.420 --> 23:50.530
Creates an official trail, of course.

23:50.570 --> 23:54.920
You preferred the
back-channel approach.

23:56.340 --> 24:02.480
In the hope of continuing goodwill,
this second one is on the house.

24:04.930 --> 24:09.230
You really should learn
to polish the brass.

24:44.490 --> 24:46.310
Did you lock yourself out?

24:47.120 --> 24:49.336
Were you expecting somebody else?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.366
Good to see you up and around.

24:51.390 --> 24:52.826
What you got in the box, Duck?

24:52.850 --> 24:55.266
A dead starling.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.776
According to superstition,
when a bird flies in a house,

24:58.800 --> 25:01.516
it means that someone who
lives there is about to die.

25:01.540 --> 25:03.506
I was worried.

25:03.530 --> 25:05.066
Mother has moved out.

25:05.090 --> 25:07.016
I thought the augury might apply to me.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.066
Yeah? How is she doing?

25:09.090 --> 25:12.186
The bad days far outnumber the good.

25:12.210 --> 25:16.466
The scientist in me knows that
Alzheimer's is a deterioration,

25:16.490 --> 25:18.580
progressively, of brain cells,

25:18.620 --> 25:24.826
but the philosopher wonders whether it isn't the
soul's violent attempt to eliminate painful memories

25:24.850 --> 25:28.396
of a life fraught with contradiction.

25:28.420 --> 25:31.040
Yeah. Brain can do that.

25:31.950 --> 25:34.436
I mean, the bird was here,
where it didn't belong.

25:34.460 --> 25:37.966
Instead of flying south,
it came in here for warmth.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.016
Alighted on that chair.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.606
It didn't move when the dogs closed in.

25:43.630 --> 25:45.676
It happened all so slowly.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.066
The eldest one, Cooper, he opened
his mouth, and he grabbed it.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.656
I yelled, and the bird fell on the floor.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.336
Poor thing.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.236
I did so wish that it
might still be alive.

25:57.260 --> 26:01.656
I suppose the omen
applied to the bird itself.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.980
You've been told about the possibility
of a war crimes tribunal in the Hague?

26:06.540 --> 26:11.116
Yeah, I had a phone conversation
with Ambassador Saydia.

26:11.140 --> 26:12.696
Netherlands are lovely.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.306
Windmills are all frozen.
Tulips are all dead.

26:15.330 --> 26:18.126
Not dead; Dormant.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.416
You're not going, Duck.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.920
And what have you brought?

26:22.960 --> 26:26.580
CIA footage taken in Jalozai.

26:27.560 --> 26:32.596
Such devastation in that
camp. Such suffering and pain.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.650
Checked this out of your
local library, did you?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.906
Pulled a few strings.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.926
I thought I might save lives
flung there by the maelstrom.

26:41.950 --> 26:46.380
I could sooner pluck a
grain of sand from a sirocco.

26:49.350 --> 26:52.960
You, uh... you got a sheet anywhere?

26:53.580 --> 26:54.896
What?

26:54.920 --> 26:56.826
"A calm and responsible person."

26:56.850 --> 26:59.866
All her coworkers say the same thing.

26:59.890 --> 27:01.866
Until she saw Ducky yesterday.

27:01.890 --> 27:04.676
We can change our perspective, but
it doesn't change what happened.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.876
If you were a dork in high school, you'll
always be a dork in high school.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.600
That's not why I wanted my computers.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.660
I'm not trying to rewrite my life story.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.126
Did you read something personal into
what I just said? McGee, I don't follow.

27:15.150 --> 27:17.740
Tony, there's nothing new to learn there.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.576
- There has to be.
- Why?

27:21.600 --> 27:24.860
The alternative is that
Ducky was Dr. Mengele.

27:39.270 --> 27:40.856
That's not her brother.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.496
I will know his face when I see it.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.390
His name was Javid.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.476
He came to me with lacerations.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.980
It looked as if he'd
survived a knife fight.

27:50.010 --> 27:55.196
I stitched him up, but he
returned, the wounds reopened.

27:55.220 --> 27:57.386
The guy conducting the interrogation?

27:57.410 --> 28:01.376
His official affiliation
was a mystery. We-We...

28:01.400 --> 28:04.490
We first met when he came
to me for a physical checkup.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.116
Then we met socially
for a game of chess.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.086
He suffered from a
rare congenital defect.

28:11.110 --> 28:14.606
He himself could not feel pain.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.340
Feels nothing.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.016
Specializing in torture.

28:18.040 --> 28:22.450
If you can't feel anything, you
don't know when anything's gone wrong.

28:23.810 --> 28:27.350
A lot go wrong out there, Ducky?

28:27.410 --> 28:32.530
I was never in that room, but I became
suspicious when Javid came to me a third time.

28:32.560 --> 28:36.176
I made inquiries... I discovered
that my chess-playing companion

28:36.200 --> 28:38.876
was known to everyone
in the camp, except me,

28:38.900 --> 28:41.260
as "Mr. Pain."

28:41.290 --> 28:44.576
That's him. That's Javid.

28:44.600 --> 28:48.626
Poor boy insisted that he knew
nothing about troop movements or spies.

28:48.650 --> 28:53.406
Neither that nor any other force could
stop Mr. Pain from torturing him for days.

28:53.430 --> 28:58.970
And-And-And each time, he was
sent back to me to be sewn up.

28:59.390 --> 29:04.820
It was my first exposure to that
kind of interrogation technique.

29:05.660 --> 29:10.360
In the intervening years, it has
become dreadfully commonplace.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.816
Are you gonna make me ask again?

29:15.840 --> 29:18.886
I suppose it's inevitable,
when we reach the tipping point,

29:18.910 --> 29:22.710
when your curiosity
outweighs your courtesy.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.116
What the hell is wrong with you, Ducky?

29:24.140 --> 29:26.876
Your life is in the balance here.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.000
What did you do there?

29:28.030 --> 29:30.310
Only what was required of me.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.146
Are you protecting that guy?

29:32.170 --> 29:36.860
I am protecting no one, Jethro. Look...

29:37.520 --> 29:41.930
if you intend to unravel
strings further on this matter,

29:41.960 --> 29:45.120
I would prefer that you
leave them un-pulled.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.930
No.

29:52.060 --> 29:54.650
Gibbs. Are you leaving?

29:57.640 --> 30:01.006
Yeah. Good to see you, Doctor.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.310
Good to see you, too.

30:02.340 --> 30:06.476
Donnie, I think I found a place
in the ground that's not too tough.

30:06.500 --> 30:10.130
Well, I'm sure that will be lovely for...

30:12.130 --> 30:15.100
It was only stunned.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.780
Only stunned.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.656
He's been, uh... waxing philosophical.

30:24.680 --> 30:29.050
Did he read you passages from
Rilke'sLetters to a Young Poet, hmm?

30:30.180 --> 30:32.950
Keep an eye on him.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.526
What do you think? Is that Mosuma?

30:41.550 --> 30:42.550
What am I looking at?

30:42.590 --> 30:46.636
We have been sifting through old crime scene photos
within walking distance of the same neighborhood.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.146
Trying to prove she's seen him before.

30:48.170 --> 30:51.700
And that she was lying when she told the
ambassador it was a heat of the moment thing.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.356
If she's a liar, Ducky's in the clear.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.806
Good theory.

30:54.830 --> 30:58.826
It is a good theory, but
it's... not. We got nothing.

30:58.850 --> 31:00.766
Boss, it was a coincidence.

31:00.790 --> 31:02.976
No, it's not; It's fate.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.816
What does this woman know about Ducky?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.160
He won't say.

31:06.190 --> 31:09.146
Well, if the ambassador gets his hands
around his neck, he'll make him say.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.586
McGee, I.D.the guy on this film.

31:11.610 --> 31:13.020
Sounds more like a job for Tony.

31:13.070 --> 31:17.146
No, that's a genuine bad
guy. He's not an actor.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.340
Probably tied to the CIA.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.486
Yeah. Gibbs.

31:21.510 --> 31:23.306
Gibbs, it's Jordan.

31:23.330 --> 31:25.326
I was just in the kitchen
making him some supper.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.016
I came to check on him, and...

31:28.040 --> 31:30.166
Well, I have no idea where he went.

31:30.190 --> 31:32.530
I do.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.060
Let's go, Duck.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.550
No.

31:41.590 --> 31:43.986
- Can I help you?
- Special Agent Gibbs.

31:44.010 --> 31:46.726
You can't arrest this man.
The accusations are false.

31:46.750 --> 31:52.056
Dr. Mallard has been accused of torturing and
killing a citizen of Afghanistan seeking refuge.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.776
You have evidence to dispute this?

31:54.800 --> 31:56.736
Then the course of action is set.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.350
A tribunal must be convened.

31:58.390 --> 32:02.376
Then you force me to petition
for the arrest of Mosuma Daoub.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.860
You're harboring a criminal.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.020
I have had no contact
with your State Department,

32:08.060 --> 32:11.176
which suggests they are
unaware of what has transpired.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.480
Perhaps because you want
to protect your friend.

32:13.510 --> 32:16.336
You arrest him, I arrest her.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.800
Lack of respect shown
by you and your people.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.730
You will create an
international incident, sir.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.516
You're the diplomat, not me.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.610
Obviously.

32:26.590 --> 32:29.200
Dr. Mallard.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.210
Ambassador.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.546
Have you brought legal counsel?

32:33.570 --> 32:36.476
I don't need counsel.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.570
I've come here to surrender.

32:54.680 --> 33:00.700
"All that is necessary for the triumph
of evil is that good men do nothing."

33:01.470 --> 33:03.930
You're quoting Edmund Burke.

33:05.370 --> 33:08.190
All day with Ducky.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.910
I've got to get him
to call off the dogs.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.200
Gibbs...

33:16.240 --> 33:19.710
the ambassador answers only to the
highest authority in his country.

33:19.740 --> 33:22.656
You cannot apply enough
pressure to bend him.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.636
He has not contacted
the State Department.

33:24.660 --> 33:27.100
He does not want this.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.196
This a lesson in Mideast diplomacy?

33:32.220 --> 33:34.996
Political relations what they are
between Afghanistan and the U. S.,

33:35.020 --> 33:39.326
he cannot afford to
appear as the aggressor.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.120
He needs an out.

33:44.010 --> 33:47.566
It is seven hours until
sunrise in Kabul, then...

33:47.590 --> 33:50.326
it moves up the chain.

33:50.350 --> 33:54.460
There is still time, if you
can get Ducky to open up.

33:54.670 --> 33:57.076
Did you write this aging program, McGee?

33:57.100 --> 34:00.636
Yeah, updated some of the
protocols on the existing version.

34:00.660 --> 34:04.870
It's not bad. Let's see how
we do with facial recognition.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.616
I heard about your shipment
from home. I was kind of shocked.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.065
Big surprise... I was a dork.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.139
That's not what I meant.

34:13.179 --> 34:18.085
Well, you may not have noticed, but it's taken a
lot of work to outgrow those awkward, geeky phases.

34:18.110 --> 34:19.770
I like your geeky parts.

34:19.820 --> 34:24.045
Well, I do, too, but I want to be more than
just a walking search engine, you know?

34:24.070 --> 34:26.505
See, the tricky thing is
adding the new layers...

34:26.530 --> 34:29.565
Without losing some of
the old ones; I get that.

34:29.590 --> 34:31.760
Well, then, what are you shocked at?

34:31.790 --> 34:34.310
Oh, I can't believe you were a Mac guy.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.246
Got him.

34:38.270 --> 34:41.080
Agency I.D.card for Marcin Jerek.

34:41.110 --> 34:43.969
Born in Poland, fled to Britain.

34:44.020 --> 34:46.516
Until health complications
forced him into retirement,

34:46.540 --> 34:49.600
Jerek lectured on interrogation
techniques at Langley.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.545
He's an expert at breaking a subject.

34:51.570 --> 34:53.106
Now we have to break him.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.516
Address is in Virginia.
That's nice work, McEgghead.

34:55.540 --> 34:58.156
Oh, and the box is going back
to the attic. That's smart.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.850
Yeah, got everything I needed.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.486
All the data is right here.

35:02.510 --> 35:05.320
Your head really is shaped
like an egg, you know that?

35:05.660 --> 35:07.950
Don't do that.

35:12.050 --> 35:15.036
Thank you for seeing us, Your Excellency.

35:15.060 --> 35:19.806
We need a... a conversation
with Dr. Mallard.

35:19.830 --> 35:23.660
He has made it clear he does
not wish to speak with you.

35:24.070 --> 35:27.350
- No, not me.
- Then who?

35:30.060 --> 35:32.490
Just in here, sir.

35:36.550 --> 35:40.610
I'm taken from my
home by federal agents,

35:40.650 --> 35:45.580
delivered to the Afghani government
and accused of war crimes.

35:45.610 --> 35:50.370
And after all this, it's just Ducky.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.726
When you left Jalozai, we were in
the middle of a game. Do you rember?

35:54.750 --> 35:58.546
Vividly. You had me in
a knight-bishop fork.

35:58.570 --> 36:00.536
You should've seen this guy's place.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.526
Tower of London's got nothing on it.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.526
It's like a weapons museum.

36:04.550 --> 36:06.590
In here.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.150
What is going on?

36:09.180 --> 36:12.270
It's all right, Mosuma. Just listen.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.086
Then you decide both their fates.

36:18.110 --> 36:21.400
Oh, it appears theirs
will be the next move.

36:21.430 --> 36:24.806
I suspect Trent is to
blame for this betrayal.

36:24.830 --> 36:25.940
Trent?

36:25.970 --> 36:30.590
The destiny of students to
disappoint their masters.

36:30.620 --> 36:34.340
So do you think they expect us to
quake in fear at the hangman's noose?

36:34.390 --> 36:37.150
I have surrendered to their judgment.

36:37.180 --> 36:40.530
It is beyond my powers to
induce you to admit your shame.

36:40.570 --> 36:42.640
Oh, once again, you misread me.

36:42.680 --> 36:45.200
You feel no pain because
of your physical condition.

36:45.230 --> 36:48.040
But that is no excuse
for your lack of remorse.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.826
Their enemies were hidden
amongst them, so I am summoned.

36:52.850 --> 36:58.890
Times of war call for
a greater enemy, but...

36:59.180 --> 37:01.760
you flew in, Doctor.

37:01.790 --> 37:03.876
A moth to the flame.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.340
Ignorant, you would
be burned by its touch.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.676
You were a tourist.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.890
I came there to save lives.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.676
You were there to destroy them.

37:12.700 --> 37:15.226
One life to save thousands.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.460
You do not think it costs?

37:17.490 --> 37:22.390
How many did you save? And
how many did you take? Tell me.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.340
He does not deny he killed my brother.

37:25.370 --> 37:31.076
You never learned that death, although
occasionally unavoidable, was rarely of use to me.

37:31.100 --> 37:35.276
I cannot carry on conversations
with the dead. Accept it.

37:35.300 --> 37:40.060
Millions are alive still because of
the work I conducted while you ran.

37:40.090 --> 37:43.300
You shroud your depravity in principle.

37:43.330 --> 37:46.876
But you, you take such...
joy in what you do.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.630
Joy and pain must be earned.

37:48.670 --> 37:51.670
You're like a child
pulling the wings off flies.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.256
My curse was my gift.

37:54.280 --> 37:59.170
My deficiency was the fuel that drove
my life towards a singular pursuit.

37:59.220 --> 38:02.276
The pursuit of suffering!

38:02.300 --> 38:06.110
Of understanding the
limits of human conviction.

38:06.140 --> 38:12.120
The moment when a person abandons
their most deeply-held beliefs.

38:12.150 --> 38:13.856
I've seen the tools of your trade.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.110
Hmm, and I've seen yours.

38:15.140 --> 38:19.460
So which of your morphine
victims have brought us here?

38:19.490 --> 38:21.430
His name was Javid.

38:21.470 --> 38:23.010
An innocent caught up in your net.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.816
Who wanted no part of war.
Who sought only safety.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.096
Javid did not know anything.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.896
There was no reason.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.116
Yes, there was.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.946
He had nothing to give you.

38:33.970 --> 38:39.410
I was there with him, speaking
with him through his dying breath.

38:39.450 --> 38:43.896
While you ignored his infection, providing
only the overdose that killed him.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.140
It was an agonizing decision.

38:46.170 --> 38:48.010
But it was your decision.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.680
No amount of pain removes free will.

38:50.710 --> 38:54.140
If I kept him alive, he would
have continued to suffer.

38:54.170 --> 38:58.920
Dying slowly, in excruciating
pain, at your hands.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.226
So you became the "bringer of death."

39:01.250 --> 39:02.936
What was the point in it all?

39:02.960 --> 39:05.450
How can you still not see?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.730
What did you want from him?

39:07.760 --> 39:12.920
Nothing. I wanted nothing from him.

39:17.800 --> 39:22.976
Javid was not your
target. He was your weapon.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.116
The boy was the means to break a man.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.176
Your bleeding heart
eased everyone's fears.

39:30.200 --> 39:35.180
Without fear, I could not do my job.

39:36.550 --> 39:39.580
You were torturing me.

39:39.610 --> 39:43.330
To change you. But you
took too long to break.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.200
I could have saved him.

39:50.690 --> 39:53.630
I have heard enough.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.160
If only you'd left sooner.

39:58.190 --> 40:02.050
Hope left with the saint.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.990
The savage brought salvation.

40:17.730 --> 40:20.490
You all right, Mosuma?

40:27.370 --> 40:29.900
Excuse me.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.910
Come. Let us go.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.406
You are free to go, Dr. Mallard.

40:38.430 --> 40:41.830
The charges against
you will not be pursued.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.280
You're forgiven.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.596
For the crime, Jethro.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.910
For the act, there is no forgiveness.

41:03.540 --> 41:06.120
I can't remember where this goes.

41:06.670 --> 41:09.256
I just want everything
to be perfect here.

41:09.280 --> 41:12.516
Jimmy, I know you're anxious
to have Dr. Mallard back,

41:12.540 --> 41:16.030
but he's not the kind of man who
wants a big show of affection.

41:20.250 --> 41:23.620
What kind of man is he?

41:29.270 --> 41:31.890
Welcome back, Doctor.

41:32.270 --> 41:34.760
Dr. Mallard.

41:38.010 --> 41:40.336
Uh, while you were gone, I, uh...

41:40.360 --> 41:43.506
I was studying the penmanship on
the Declaration of Independence...

41:43.530 --> 41:45.556
Mr. Palmer...

41:45.580 --> 41:48.990
Jimmy, why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

41:49.360 --> 41:53.716
Go outside. Smell a rose or two.

41:53.740 --> 41:56.590
Actually, it's pretty cold out. I...

42:00.980 --> 42:03.310
Sure.

42:06.990 --> 42:09.690
Thanks.

42:10.890 --> 42:12.746

some people think that J Street was omitted as an
intentional slight against Chief Justice John Jay,

42:19.530 --> 42:21.906
but that isn't it, is it?

42:21.930 --> 42:27.746
It's because in 1791 a capital "J"
so closely resembled a capital "I,"

42:27.770 --> 42:32.360
so they couldn't have both.

42:34.198 --> 42:37.238
They were just trying to
keep people from getting lost.
