17:51.236 --> 17:53.322
I'm just trying to understand.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.491
I'm a bit confused.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.034
Am I a mark?

17:58.619 --> 17:59.453
Yeah.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.248
For what? I'm...

18:03.999 --> 18:05.209
I'm broke.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.921
I was trying to get into a study
at your work.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.548
And I said I'm sorry,
so can you leave now, please?

18:12.466 --> 18:13.383
Why?

18:14.176 --> 18:16.929
-I really don't need...
-No, really, I'm asking you...

18:18.055 --> 18:18.889
why?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.558
Is this some AA shit?

18:22.518 --> 18:23.685
I'm enjoying this pond.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.773
You remind me of my little girl,
that's all.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.152
If there's anything I can help...

18:34.530 --> 18:35.405
So...

18:37.407 --> 18:38.242
why?

18:42.579 --> 18:45.415
Because I am addicted to a drug
that your company's testing.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.002
That's not the "why" I'm asking.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.047
What "why" are you asking?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.431
Five years ago, my sister and I got into
a really bad fight.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.227
Very, very bad.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.313
And I can't fix it.

19:11.358 --> 19:15.404
So there's this rock
that sits in my stomach, this cold rock.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.907
Like a boulder, and it's just there...

19:20.617 --> 19:21.451
all the time.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.412
And I found this pill...

19:25.706 --> 19:27.332
It helps me get through the day.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.878
It's not hurting anyone.

19:32.337 --> 19:36.091
And it makes me feel good. It is
the only thing that makes me feel good.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.802
Have you tried talking to her?

19:40.095 --> 19:40.971
I can't.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.980
Why shouldn't I be able to take
a pill like that whenever I want?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.525
You should, hon.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.612
If it ain't hurting anyone.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.238
Hmm?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.575
[people chattering]

20:12.753 --> 20:13.795
Super happy.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.464
[keyboard clacking]

20:20.302 --> 20:21.178
Helpful.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.142
Togetherness.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.518
You don't have to rush.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.020
Okay.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.272
Sorry.

20:36.985 --> 20:37.986
Sisters.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.907
Making faces at each other.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.534
It's supposed to be an emotion.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
What you feel.

20:48.121 --> 20:48.956
Fine.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.874
[keyboard clacking]

20:52.542 --> 20:55.504
[woman]
Now, please turn your attention to me...

20:56.588 --> 20:58.465
as I ask you this final question.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.030
[machine buzzes]

21:23.448 --> 21:24.366
The test is complete.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.661
Please go back
to the reception area and wait.

21:27.744 --> 21:28.578
Did I...?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.748
Did I pass the test?
What was that last question?

21:33.208 --> 21:35.085
I was telling the truth
about all those pictures.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.297
-[woman] This test is not about the truth.
-Well, what is it about?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.340
Defense mechanisms.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.051
I don't have fucking defense mechanisms.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.805
I think you should let me do it again.
Who's in charge of the red light?

21:47.347 --> 21:50.934
I... I don't fucking understand because
I am supposed to be part of the trial.

21:51.018 --> 21:51.977
[woman] I'm sorry.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.855
This is fucking bullshit.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.362
[Annie] Patricia. Patricia.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.614
No. No, no, no, no, no. No  more favors.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.950
I got bosses around. No more. Go.

22:19.713 --> 22:23.425
-[whispering] We had a deal.
-I said I could funnel you through ULP.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.719
You failed the intake test.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.346
It is out of my hands.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.223
No, I have to get into that study,
Patricia.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.516
All the way. I can't.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.604
Move on, please.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.818
There you go. Thank you.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.661
[Annie]
Patricia, may I speak with you, please?

22:54.915 --> 22:56.041
You have a daughter.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.836
Her name is Usnavy,
and she goes to Hunter College.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.048
And if you don't get me into that study,
you're never gonna see her again.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.674
What?

23:05.258 --> 23:07.594
Yeah, I know a guy who has a van,

23:07.677 --> 23:10.722
and if anything happens to me,
he knows what to do.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.641
You're fucking crazy.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.851
I'm not fucking crazy, Patricia.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.062
I'm just goal-oriented.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.279
Two minutes.

23:27.989 --> 23:28.990
Go sit over there.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.346
This one's the same, that's...

23:51.680 --> 23:53.306
Well, I guess it's kind of gray.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.891
-Hi. Excuse me.
-Hi.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.352
I have some good news.
We're going to upgrade you.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.311
Oh.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.773
Just between you and me,
it's a much, much safer trial.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.985
Okay. Um, does it have the same pay?

24:05.068 --> 24:07.821
-You just hand this over to me.
-Okay.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.824
And you can go and talk
to my colleague over there at the desk,

24:10.907 --> 24:11.992
and sort it all out.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.243
Okay.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.623
So-- so, what do you mean, "safer trial"?

24:18.707 --> 24:19.541
It's fine.

24:26.673 --> 24:27.799
Your daughter is safe.

<i>that the GRTA will use as a guide</i>
<i>for pills B and C.</i>

26:53.653 --> 26:55.905

Going to blue.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.348
Let's lay them down gently, people.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.476
Hard entry is our enemy.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.730
[equipment beeps] [girl humming]

32:34.327 --> 32:36.329
[eagle screams]

32:37.330 --> 32:38.915
[automated voice] <i>Tank is full.</i>

32:39.457 --> 32:41.000
<i>Please remove nozzle.</i>

32:44.963 --> 32:46.381
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

32:47.966 --> 32:49.133
Think fast.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.677
[yelps] Oh.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.553
[Ellie] There's 24,000 words in there.

32:52.637 --> 32:53.680
[Annie] What?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.974
[Ellie] You know... picture?

32:56.683 --> 32:57.517
Oh.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.563
Twenty-four thousand... words.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.982
[laughs]

33:04.065 --> 33:04.983
Cute.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.609
How many words is that?

33:07.527 --> 33:08.361
One.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.071
[engine turns over]

33:10.488 --> 33:12.740
[rock music playing]

33:19.539 --> 33:22.250
-[Annie] Okay, '80s.
-[Ellie] There's a supernatural element.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.127
[Annie] Yep, but it has to make you cry.

33:24.210 --> 33:27.255
-[Ellie] Oh, it's this one.
-Oh-oh. It's a body-switch movie.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.382
He's him, and he's him.

33:29.465 --> 33:32.385
And they crashed their dirt bikes
into each other,

33:32.468 --> 33:34.762
they woke up in the hospital,
and they've switched bodies.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.767
And the young one
has been masturbating constantly.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.603
Now they're on this hijinks-filled wackadoo road trip that ends with...

33:45.481 --> 33:49.777
a secret sect of Utah businessmen...

33:50.445 --> 33:51.487
that, um...

33:51.571 --> 33:52.780
mmm...

33:52.864 --> 33:54.115
practice soul-swapping.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.578
I'm surprised you didn't add sodomy.
That's pretty light for you.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.038
Well, I'm not finished yet.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.416
It's tragic, because that old man
is now in this young body,

34:03.499 --> 34:05.168
and he's gonna leave his grandson,

34:05.251 --> 34:07.754
just ditch him,
and let him slip off into Alzheimer's.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.006
There she is.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.550
I'm actually pissed about this.

34:14.010 --> 34:14.886
Hey!

34:15.511 --> 34:16.345
Hey!

34:16.512 --> 34:18.431
I see you, motherfucker!

34:18.514 --> 34:21.476
That wasn't your body in the first place!
You got to give it back!

34:21.559 --> 34:23.227
You can't cheat Father Time!

34:28.566 --> 34:31.235
[both laugh]

34:33.237 --> 34:35.990
[Annie] Apparently in Colorado,
fast lane means slow lane.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.493
[Ellie] Oh, my God! That's a bumpy road!

34:39.077 --> 34:40.161
To the left.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.956
To <i>your </i>left.

34:44.832 --> 34:45.666
[Ellie] Okay.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.711
Right now, it looks like you're sort of,
like, fondling the underside of it.

34:48.795 --> 34:52.173
-I am not. What am I supposed to do?
-Just, like, give it some gumption.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.008
-That's perfect. Like that?
-Yes!

34:54.092 --> 34:55.218
[Annie] Stay there. Stay.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.344
One.

34:57.095 --> 34:57.970
Two.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.639
[camera clicks] Three.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.850
That's really funny.
Can I have the camera back, please?

35:02.934 --> 35:03.810
No.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.437
It's pretty.
I wanted to take a nice picture.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.690
Well, I am the designated documentarian,
so no.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.776
[Annie opens and closes car's door] [traffic noises]

35:27.458 --> 35:29.460
[Ellie] Yeah, I know. I gotta go.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.921
-[man] <i>Love you.</i>
-Love you too.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.339
[man] <i>See you soon, honey.</i>

35:33.965 --> 35:34.966
-Bye.
-[man] <i>Bye.</i>

35:40.972 --> 35:42.974
[both sigh]

35:44.851 --> 35:46.352
[yawns]

35:52.650 --> 35:53.651
I like this.

35:54.902 --> 35:55.778
What?

35:57.155 --> 36:00.950
Just... doing something with you.
I don't know, it's...

36:02.285 --> 36:04.203
-It's been a while.
-Was that Mom...

36:04.620 --> 36:06.330
that you were talking to just now?

36:07.623 --> 36:09.375
No, that was Ben.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.837
I just told him that we'd be there
by tomorrow night.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.758
I just figured because you and Mom
have reconnected... or whatever.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.807
[Ellie] I didn't reconnect with her, okay?

36:24.891 --> 36:27.268
She wrote me a letter,
said it was an emergency,

36:27.351 --> 36:28.686
that she needed something,

36:28.769 --> 36:30.813
-so I called her back, once.
-[Annie] Oh, my God.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.274
-Here, take it. Read it.
-No. God.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.775
-I'm not mad.
-I didn't say you were.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.235
-Stop.
-I didn't say you were mad.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.403
Let's watch a movie.

36:37.486 --> 36:38.988
[man on TV] <i>Nothing to think over.</i>

36:39.071 --> 36:39.906
Okay.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.116
[man on TV]
<i>They're trying to say that I'm in a gang.</i>

36:42.200 --> 36:45.036
-<i>They think that I'm the leader of a gang.</i>
-[woman] <i>Well, you told them.</i>

36:45.119 --> 36:47.872
-[remote clicks]
-<i>You waste his time and mine.</i>

36:49.749 --> 36:51.792
-Oh, no, thank you.
-No, can we...?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.753
Stop, I like this movie. I like it.

36:54.086 --> 36:54.921
Leave it.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.381
[man] <i>He requires more serious...</i>

36:57.465 --> 36:58.591
[Annie sighs]

37:03.429 --> 37:04.597
[laughing]

37:07.141 --> 37:08.768
Annie's favorite.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.520
[Annie] I can't believe
you like this fantasy shit.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.105
[Ellie in an elf voice] But it's real.

37:13.189 --> 37:18.903
Annie, I'm Ellia,
your cursed Elven sister.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.780
Rescue me.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.282
[chuckles] From what?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.159
From a normal life.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.038
That is all on you.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.626
[normal voice] Okay.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.630
I've got a fantasy for you.

37:41.509 --> 37:42.927
-[Annie turns off TV]
-About a girl

37:43.010 --> 37:45.972
moving her life to Salt Lake City,

37:46.055 --> 37:49.684
because that's
where her fiancé has been transferred...

37:51.477 --> 37:54.647
because she thinks it'd make her happy.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.984
But she... But she's afraid...

37:58.901 --> 38:01.279
of a nice family that stays together...

38:03.155 --> 38:04.240
a nice job,

38:04.657 --> 38:05.992
nice kids.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.870
Afraid because maybe
she can't maintain that...

38:11.163 --> 38:12.164
stability.

38:14.834 --> 38:18.421
Maybe she'll just realize that isn't
what she wanted, and she'll just...

38:19.338 --> 38:20.631
fuck it all up and...

38:21.632 --> 38:22.967
her kids along with it.

38:25.011 --> 38:25.970
But she doesn't.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.307
It works.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.310
It works out fine.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.063
Sounds like a fantasy
of someone who gave up.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.408
You have such a thing.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.952
-[Annie] A thing?
-[Ellie] Mm-hmm.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.580
With, like, going eight levels too harsh.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.041
-No, don't do that.
-[Ellie] Do what?

38:55.124 --> 38:59.295
Don't guess what you think I think
and then say it like it's coming from you.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.381
You don't think
that I have my own doubts, Annie?

39:02.465 --> 39:04.175
You're so caught up
with your own narcissism.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.969
-I'm sorry, my narcissism?
-The fact you can't take care of anything,

39:07.053 --> 39:09.305
-or keep one relationship going.
-I'm sorry about your dog.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.723
Your fucking Mom-like narcissism.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.850
-I loved him too!
-Even the whole armpit pictures.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.352
What point are you trying to make?

39:14.435 --> 39:18.064
That I'm fucking stupid
for wanting to remember a nice trip?

39:18.147 --> 39:21.108
Because I'm sad.
I'm sad that I'm moving away from you!

39:21.650 --> 39:24.028
It's hard to talk to you
when you're this emotional.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.824
You're the one acting like Mom.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.994
You know, I have my things too, I just...

39:33.913 --> 39:36.123
I just don't broadcast them to the world.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.042
Is that what I do?

39:40.294 --> 39:42.129
You also fucking lie constantly.

39:43.631 --> 39:48.761
Every second, of every day,
of your entire fucking life

39:48.844 --> 39:50.971
is broadcasting how normal you are.

39:51.847 --> 39:55.476
[smirks] You're so desperate for someone
to tell you you're okay.

39:55.851 --> 39:58.437
[huffs and laughs]

39:58.854 --> 40:01.190
I don't know how this started.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.441
I'm sorry.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.360
I was just trying to talk to you.

40:04.443 --> 40:08.656
You don't have to shut down
just because I'm saying something real.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.408
I'm not shutting down.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.747
Can I say one last <i>real</i> thing?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.464
Every time I think of New York,
without you in it...

40:26.715 --> 40:28.801
This is seriously true, this isn't a lie.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.554
...I feel happy.

40:34.056 --> 40:37.601
Because now I won't have to feel bad
about not calling you,

40:38.269 --> 40:39.728
or doing anything with you.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.731
You'll be far away.

40:43.899 --> 40:48.070
And we can grow apart...
and we won't have to pretend we didn't.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.827
I'm gonna miss you too, Annie.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.980
Do you want to take an actual picture?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.107
Of both of us?

41:25.691 --> 41:27.735
-I'm not stupid.
-What?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.239
It's the perfect time
to fuck with me again.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.659
No, I'm not fucking with you.
I'm not. I'm being serious.

41:36.076 --> 41:36.911
Okay.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.163
I do want to remember this.

41:41.457 --> 41:44.168
My-- The camera is in my bag.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.677
Here, I'll take it.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.596
-Hold the wheel.
-Okay.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.225
[Annie] They should have, like, a stick
for something like this.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.142
Three.

42:00.726 --> 42:01.685
Two.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.979
-One. [camera clicks]
-That's so annoying.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.606
That was fucking funny.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.483
No, it's not funny anymore.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.567
-Give it to me.
-Come on.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.819
-Annie... No, I bought it.
-Ellie, stop. Come on.

42:14.114 --> 42:17.034
-I did take a picture of my armpit.
-Why won't you take the picture?

42:17.576 --> 42:19.995
-[brakes and tires squealing]
-[car crashes]

42:35.427 --> 42:37.471
[breathing heavily]

43:14.883 --> 43:16.885
[whimpers]

43:17.553 --> 43:19.179
[Azumi] Welcome back, subjects.

43:20.389 --> 43:21.390
Welcome back.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.106
[buzzer sounds]
