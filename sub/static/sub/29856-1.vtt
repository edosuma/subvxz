like Tim or Vicky?

40:46.109 --> 40:47.274
Who's Tim and Vicky?

40:47.276 --> 40:48.077
Exactly.

40:49.111 --> 40:49.912
I mean,

40:51.147 --> 40:54.381
for me it's not about
being celebrated,

40:54.383 --> 40:57.417
but it's about making sure
that their stories are told.

40:57.419 --> 40:58.819
They deserved to have
their stories told

40:58.821 --> 41:01.855
just as much as any
stupid celebrity.

41:01.857 --> 41:05.129
I mean that's why I started
writing the Weekly Spotlights.

41:06.963 --> 41:09.098
I want them to be able to

41:10.399 --> 41:13.066
live on the page forever.

41:13.068 --> 41:13.903

41:15.338 --> 41:17.904

every single person in town

41:17.906 --> 41:21.408
and they may not be famous

41:21.410 --> 41:23.347
but they are unique.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.848
And I think if people
gave unique a chance

41:26.850 --> 41:28.448
they might like it.

41:28.450 --> 41:29.517
Well, I did.

reverberate off of the page.

51:36.658 --> 51:38.892
Very well 'cause
my name is Boris.

51:38.894 --> 51:40.526
He's not a vampire.

What?

52:04.919 --> 52:06.185
It's a legitimate fear.

52:06.187 --> 52:07.553
You know, I've seen
at least 20 stories

52:07.555 --> 52:08.855
of guys getting their
junk chopped off

52:08.857 --> 52:10.089
because they
betrayed their wife,

52:10.091 --> 52:11.691
or girlfriend, or boyfriend.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.529
I mean in Thailand,
it's an epidemic.

52:14.597 --> 52:15.796
Do you think they deserved it?

52:15.798 --> 52:16.633
To be punished?

52:17.566 --> 52:18.932
Yeah, sure.

52:18.934 --> 52:20.000
I mean they did something wrong

52:20.002 --> 52:21.935
and there should
be consequences.

52:21.937 --> 52:23.703
You know, has anybody
ever done something to you

52:23.705 --> 52:26.038
that was so bad that
you thought about

52:26.040 --> 52:27.910
doing something extreme?

No.

that's my biggest fear.

Oh and being late and
hiccups of course.

Oh, I'm totally with
you on the hiccups.

52:43.292 --> 52:44.957
Yeah, whenever my
hiccups show up

52:44.959 --> 52:46.225
I'm just like, when are
you gonna get away hiccups?

52:46.227 --> 52:47.528

better get out of here

You know, we actually
went the wrong way.

53:14.222 --> 53:16.792
But it's faster to
go back this way.

Google on this story of yours

53:49.158 --> 53:50.656

53:50.658 --> 53:51.528

it's a slam dunk.

54:01.803 --> 54:02.805
Listen, Greg,

54:04.138 --> 54:05.104
I was thinking,

54:05.106 --> 54:08.741
why don't we do a piece
just on the shooting?

54:08.743 --> 54:10.676
Yeah, no, I think that
will be more interesting.

54:10.678 --> 54:11.877
I was thinking about it, right,

54:11.879 --> 54:14.180
and I think doing the
first person angle

54:14.182 --> 54:15.816
might be a little heavy handed.

Are you an insane person?

makes this special.

it's not my place,

for a little bit of freedom.

Emma's all I got man.

And despite what
she might think,

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:29.156
I'm all she's got.

01:15:32.025 --> 01:15:36.063
She's like a deer
with a broken leg.

01:15:37.198 --> 01:15:38.033
So,

01:15:39.232 --> 01:15:40.401
she's gotta keep moving

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:44.536
and living as if she
ain't got a broken leg,

01:15:44.538 --> 01:15:46.104
but the problem is,

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:49.043
all that moving
is gonna catch up.

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:53.414
Someone or something
is gonna catch up.

01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:56.916
And when they do,
she's not gonna know

01:15:56.918 --> 01:16:00.455
how to defend herself 'cause
she's only got three legs.

01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:04.188

she's been pretending

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.492

make that mistake again

for the last 10 years

01:26:06.059 --> 01:26:07.858
and written about
every person in town

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.594
so they know that
their story will

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:11.999
continue to live long
after their gone.

Yes it does.

01:26:19.205 --> 01:26:20.938

01:26:24.011 --> 01:26:25.109

and then you come here

01:26:27.814 --> 01:26:29.851
and you remind me of
where I was going!

01:26:30.984 --> 01:26:33.087
Where I could have gone and

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:35.053
you listened to me,

01:26:35.055 --> 01:26:38.592
and you ask about them.

You ask about them
with no judgment

01:26:42.663 --> 01:26:43.698
and finally,

01:26:44.998 --> 01:26:46.801
I could find a way to create

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.733
a way for their
stories to stay alive,

01:26:49.735 --> 01:26:53.006
but beyond where
their memories live.

01:26:55.909 --> 01:26:57.245
I finally felt free.

it all comes from a lie.
