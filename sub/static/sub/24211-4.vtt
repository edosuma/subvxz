WEBVTT

00:13.760 --> 00:15.040
Check-up call.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.000
-Everything is running smoothly over here.
-Smoothly?

00:18.760 --> 00:21.560
Smoothly as in Tokyo being interrogated?

00:22.320 --> 00:25.320
As in you're about to execute Rio?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.760
Berlin, what are you doing?

00:31.520 --> 00:33.080
Professor, it's Nairobi.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.680
Berlin is indisposed.
So from now on, I'm in charge.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.200
Let the matriarchy begin.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.520
If we took a photo of this moment

00:49.840 --> 00:52.800
it could be my last memory
of the Royal Mint of Spain.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.920
Leaving a string of mistakes inside,

00:57.240 --> 00:58.480
a weakened group,

00:58.760 --> 01:01.320
and only one with the guts
to pull their weight:

01:01.400 --> 01:02.280
Nairobi.

01:03.080 --> 01:06.200
What I mean, Professor,
is that this is out of control.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.640
The situation is critical.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.000
Tokyo played Russian roulette
with Berlin tied to a chair.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.440
Berlin turned her in.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.800
And then, Rio deserted

01:20.880 --> 01:24.360
and Berlin almost executed him
like some fucking Vietnamese firing squad.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.080
Helsinki suffocated Oslo.

01:33.040 --> 01:33.960
He killed him?

01:35.040 --> 01:36.280
He was a vegetal.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.000
Helsinki says he would have wanted it.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.040
As you can see,
this is a fucking disaster,

01:42.560 --> 01:45.640
so I have no choice but to take control

01:45.720 --> 01:47.640
until things get back on track!

01:47.720 --> 01:50.160
Ask him what the hell he was doing
with the police.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.920
I was at the house in Toledo,
it was part of the plan.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.720
Professor,

01:55.240 --> 01:58.000
we need to know what situation we're in.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.080
MONDAY 09:00 PM

02:00.160 --> 02:02.840
There are some loose ends,
I'm not going to lie.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.920
HOUR 83 OF THE HEIST

02:05.000 --> 02:07.600
I'd say it was the biggest loose end
of all.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.600
Assistant Inspector Angel
had discovered the Professor.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.360
He had his fingerprints

02:12.800 --> 02:15.120
and was in a coma
waiting to wake up and reveal it.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.960
The Professor was living on
borrowed time.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.200
As was everyone else.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.360
The situation in there isn't
much better from what you say.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.680
Look,

02:31.760 --> 02:33.160
you do what you have to do,

02:33.240 --> 02:35.440
I'll fix things in here
in the meantime.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.600
I'll put the call through,
probably from the tent.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Inspector.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.840
Before I get to the point I need
to clarify something.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.680
What do I call you now?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.360
Professor?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.080
Sergio? Or...

02:55.480 --> 02:56.520
Mr. Marquina?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.960
I'll always be the Professor to you.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.960
That's how we met.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.840
You'll always be Inspector Murillo to me,

03:04.920 --> 03:06.960
even if you become my executioner.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.760
Remember the first time you made love?

03:15.560 --> 03:17.760
Of course. One doesn't forget that.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.880
Well, this is my first time

03:21.120 --> 03:22.560
in the world of crime.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.120
And no matter what, I will always

03:27.800 --> 03:29.360
remember it fondly.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.680
You're an enthusiast.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.400
And this world needs people like you.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I hope that when you get out of prison

03:37.080 --> 03:39.240
you'll help the country progress.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.640
Because the truth is that...

03:41.240 --> 03:42.440
Where did it happen?

03:43.160 --> 03:44.000
What?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.240
The first time you made love.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.760
In a tent.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.400
That's wonderful.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.880
That's a good place for a first time.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.240
The sounds of the countryside,
the lights...

04:00.040 --> 04:01.400
Yes, that was right.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.000
The rest was, let's say...

04:04.800 --> 04:07.520
experimental and...

04:07.680 --> 04:08.560
brief.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.600
Okay, Professor.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.520
I'm calling to inform you
that Silene Oliveira

04:15.800 --> 04:19.360
is going into provisional custody
without bail tonight.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.720
What did she say to make you angry

04:21.800 --> 04:23.920
and skip the 72-hour custody?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
She was trying to be smart.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.240
There's something I don't get.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.720
Why do you let go of your people
instead of the hostages?

04:32.240 --> 04:34.800
There have been
discrepancies in the group.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.120
-Nothing else.
-You're against the ropes.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.680
-And you know it.
-I admit you're winning,

04:39.760 --> 04:41.240
but this is only one battle.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.520
It's nothing compared to the war.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.960
He still teases you,
with a riot on his hands?

04:48.640 --> 04:49.760
He's a rock star.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.680
Salva,

05:16.200 --> 05:17.320
how are you doing?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.160
How are you holding up?

05:19.640 --> 05:20.480
Well...

05:21.240 --> 05:24.360
I never thought tying my shoelaces
could be this painful.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.280
Those bruises could use some care.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.000
A nurse.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.480
That's a very suggestive proposal.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.760
I'd love to look after you, but...

05:39.040 --> 05:42.120
It would have to be at my place.
I want to see my daughter and...

05:42.400 --> 05:44.640
I know that's not the most romantic date.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.800
I can't think of a better date.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.280
Okay.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.080
When you spend years
obsessing about something,

05:59.640 --> 06:00.640
that something

06:00.720 --> 06:01.800
is your whole world.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.400
A perfect world.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.200
But now the plan
was not only the Professor's.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.560
It belonged to all of us.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.040
And we were all screwing it up.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.160
For once, the Professor felt weakened.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.480
And crawling into Raquel's arms
seemed like the best refuge.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.840
The only one possible.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.840
Now you're a hostage too.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.440
What's the matter?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.560
They tried to kill me.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.360
They almost did.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.160
Why did they want to kill you?

07:02.560 --> 07:04.080
They turned Tokyo in.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.280
I was going to turn myself in too.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.880
Alison!

07:15.040 --> 07:16.080
Leave her.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.720
She's lost her mind!

07:19.200 --> 07:21.400
If Tokyo shows up,
who knows what could happen.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.240
You heard him, she's been kicked out.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.200
This could actually be good.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.680
-Good for what?
-To get out, damn it!

07:31.040 --> 07:32.240
For good!

07:33.160 --> 07:35.480
Is it that hard to understand?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.320
They have locked up our colleagues

07:39.840 --> 07:41.680
when they had promised them freedom!

07:43.440 --> 07:46.160
Some of us have been truly humiliated.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.360
They've ruined my relationship

07:50.440 --> 07:51.640
and my future paternity.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.480
And regarding the money that they
promised us,

07:59.280 --> 08:00.360
it's all a lie.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.960
A fucking sham!

08:03.440 --> 08:04.840
He confirmed it!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.920
How long are we going to stay
and do nothing?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.960
The thieves are weakened now.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.520
No one can argue.
And if we don't seize this opportunity,

08:16.840 --> 08:20.200
we'll be letting them escape.
We have to finish them off!

08:20.480 --> 08:25.200
Muster up all the dignity, the
courage, the wild animal we carry inside!

08:26.160 --> 08:27.120
We must do something.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.240
I don't know...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.200
steal a gun from them.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.560
What?

08:31.920 --> 08:33.120
What are you saying?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.720
Where are we going to get a gun?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.480
Swapping one of theirs for a fake one.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.240
If you manage
to get one of the fake weapons

08:43.720 --> 08:44.960
you could swap it.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.720
Then one of them will be unarmed

08:50.320 --> 08:51.560
and one of you armed.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.680
Oh, hello, dear.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.240
-Mom, what are you doing here this late?
-Mommy!

10:02.120 --> 10:03.240
Sweetheart.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.320
Come here.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.320
Come here.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.240
But wait a minute.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.840
Tell me, what are you doing up so late?

10:11.920 --> 10:13.880
I wanted to see you before going to bed.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.040
Me too, baby.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.360
Hi.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.800
Hello.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.760
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've made dinner.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.200
You came for dinner, right?

10:29.600 --> 10:32.480
Yes. Dinner and sleep, actually.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.480
Right?

10:35.840 --> 10:36.800
Are you dating?

10:38.400 --> 10:39.320
Oh, dear.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
Well, uh.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.480
Yes, right?

10:45.840 --> 10:46.800
Kind of.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.280
But have you asked her?

10:49.920 --> 10:52.480
Actually, I haven't. But...

10:53.880 --> 10:55.360
we kissed, which is...

10:55.960 --> 10:57.000
almost the same.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.400
Okay.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.880
Come on, Paulita. Let's go.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.120
You have school tomorrow.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.360
No, don’t worry.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.680
I'll tuck her in.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.040
Thank you.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.240
Did you really hit him?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.080
Well...

11:41.760 --> 11:42.720
yes, I did.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.200
It infuriated me
to think he'd hurt you.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.720
I don't like violence.
Never have.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.800
I know it's wrong
and you can defend yourself.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.320
-It's not my bussiness, but...
-Salva.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.720
I'm glad you hit
the jerk of my ex-husband.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.240
I should have done it myself.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.760
Even if it's wrong to say so.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.840
Well...

12:15.840 --> 12:17.880
sometimes what's wrong is...

12:18.320 --> 12:19.640
the only choice.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.240
I'm speaking from experience.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.960
I'm glad you're here.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.200
Okay from now on
I need everybody closing bags.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.320
Non-stop!

13:27.400 --> 13:28.960
You won't mention the lies?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.680
Arturo, drop the Gandhi crap

13:30.760 --> 13:33.840
or you'll eat shit
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.400
Besides, I guarantee you
that I haven't lied to anyone.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.680
Nairobi is in charge now.
So everyone get packing!

13:57.760 --> 14:00.000
Nairobi has a heavy hand for a woman.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.120
Berlin, we're sinking.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.640
The most important thing
is to get out of here alive

14:10.200 --> 14:11.760
without making any more mistakes.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.280
You tell me. Are you with me...

14:21.480 --> 14:22.320
or against me?

14:25.040 --> 14:28.160
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.960
-catch a tiger by the toe,
-A tiger by the toe.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
Well, I'm going with you, Nairobi.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.000
Until the end.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.240
I'm going to abide by your coup.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.840
And I'll even confess that I am turned on

14:49.320 --> 14:52.360
by the idea of serving a woman
who is a goddess.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.520
You better pray to this goddess,

14:54.880 --> 14:57.160
because she's got your morphine.
Don't forget.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.840
That's the office where they keep
the fake guns.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.400
-So?
-So one of us has to get in there

15:05.480 --> 15:07.120
and take a blank gun.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.800
And which one of them
will you switch with?

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
Denver.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.840
He's the dumbest one.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.440
-And who will take his gun?
-Must be Monica.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.000
-When he calls her in for treatment.
-And why would she do it?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.120
It's a suicidal risk.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.520
Because that thug shot her.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.920
He's got her in a den

15:34.000 --> 15:36.440
and he took advantage
of her fear and desperation

15:37.960 --> 15:39.440
to screw her a few times.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.480
And apparently now he left you.

15:47.720 --> 15:48.640
Yes.

15:51.040 --> 15:51.880
I'm sorry.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.600
But that's what happens.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.280
Sometimes we want to change our lives.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.080
We get our hopes up.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.240
But no heist man will take you with him.

16:09.000 --> 16:09.960
Fine.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.640
I'll go get the gun.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.160
Do you have copies of the office key?

16:18.600 --> 16:19.440
No.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.160
What is Plan Chernobyl?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.000
Plan Chernobyl is a...

16:25.520 --> 16:26.920
desperate but beautiful plan.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.560
Consists in releasing the cash
in balloons from the roof,

16:30.960 --> 16:35.120
popping the balloons with gunfire
and causing some wonderful rain.

16:35.200 --> 16:39.240
-Calling the media, radio, television...
-Like the Christmas Pageant parade,

16:39.440 --> 16:40.520
but with 50 euro bills.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.320
That's Plan Chernobyl?

16:43.480 --> 16:47.640
Thousands of people picking up the dough,
spreading chaos among the police. Imagine.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.080
A billion euros rain.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.120
Right.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.800
And us vanishing amongst the frenzied mob.

16:55.960 --> 16:56.960
Very nice.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.480
You know the Professor, an idealist.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.720
He cares more about the message
than the money.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.600
And I didn't say it
because we must respect the timing.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.240
Wish me luck.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.800
Mr. Torres, in my office!

18:02.320 --> 18:03.360
Come in, Mr Torres.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.240
Let's see...

18:05.680 --> 18:08.000
could we increase the printing rate?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.760
Well, it's possible.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.040
But it would be very risky.

18:13.480 --> 18:14.720
If it gets stuck,

18:14.880 --> 18:17.120
it would take us three to four hours
to fix it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.160
Calculate the production rate increase.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.840
Okay, Miss Nairobi.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.400
Mr. Arturo.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.960
Get up, Torres. God damn it, get up!

18:51.680 --> 18:52.760
What are you doing?

18:52.960 --> 18:55.280
None of your bussiness.
Act like I'm not here.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.840
Walk to the door and don't lock it.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.320
I'm sorry, but I'll have to report you.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.560
If they find out I've seen you,
I'm done for too.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.880
Look...

19:05.160 --> 19:06.240
idiot!

19:07.760 --> 19:08.760
I have a gun.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.160
Don't you dare report me

19:11.560 --> 19:13.320
or you'll be the first to go.
Okay?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.400
Excuse me, Mr. Arturo,
but that's one of the fake guns.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.600
You left the bag open.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.400
Listen to me.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.800
Listen because I won't say it again.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.480
When all this is over,

19:28.960 --> 19:31.040
and it will be in a couple of hours,
at best,

19:31.200 --> 19:32.600
you're going to come back

19:33.280 --> 19:34.840
to your crappy job.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.960
And I'll be waiting for you the next day

19:39.560 --> 19:43.760
with a fat layoff and a disciplinary file
that will make you shit yourself.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.720
You'll be fucked up
until you retire.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.280
Okay?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.040
You have three daughters, right?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.760
And two of them
have been unemployed for...

19:54.400 --> 19:56.240
seven years, if I recall correctly.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.720
So it's up to you.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.200
Torres.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.520
-Miss Nairobi.
-What is it?

20:07.520 --> 20:11.560
We would increase production
by two million every hour.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.240
Do it.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.920
And the technical stops
will be every six hours.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.680
Because that's an extra two million.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.840
Very well.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.080
I'll get this off the ground.
Mark my words.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.440
Anything troubling you?

21:17.000 --> 21:17.920
No.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.080
I'm worried it's been the best night
of my life.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.160
Salva.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.160
You've already won me over,
no need to exaggerate.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.240
It's true.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.160
But I wasn't planning on it.
I hadn't anticipated it.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.800
Oh, you hadn't anticipated it?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.840
Do you anticipate everything?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.480
Well, let's say...

22:03.880 --> 22:05.640
I'm a man who...

22:06.640 --> 22:09.760
picks out the clothes
he's going to wear the day before.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.600
A man who became obsessed...

22:17.120 --> 22:18.080
with...

22:19.760 --> 22:21.840
making the best cider in the world.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.560
And...

22:24.240 --> 22:25.960
and I studied it all.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.320
Acidity, fermentation...

22:31.160 --> 22:33.600
Every possible reaction
of each ingredient.

22:37.000 --> 22:37.840
Year...

22:39.080 --> 22:40.440
after year, after year.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.400
And you can get one bad apple...

22:46.680 --> 22:48.440
that ruins the whole barrel.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.720
Salva,
you're really into cider, aren't you?

22:55.080 --> 22:57.200
It was my father's dream.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.000
And...

23:01.480 --> 23:03.400
he died before he could fulfill it.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.080
He...

23:08.040 --> 23:09.320
He wanted to make...

23:12.200 --> 23:14.280
twenty four hundred barrels.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.280
I understand the homage but...

23:19.080 --> 23:20.720
Why don't you make half?

23:21.160 --> 23:22.760
Or half of half,

23:23.760 --> 23:24.680
and then...

23:25.800 --> 23:27.520
focus on your own dreams?

23:39.520 --> 23:40.440
Let's go away.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.520
I wrap up this cider thing in a few days,

23:50.320 --> 23:52.160
and we'll go to the Caribbean.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.400
Well, I...

24:03.840 --> 24:05.640
I don't have the cider,

24:06.480 --> 24:09.280
but I have a mother, a daughter,

24:10.040 --> 24:13.120
-and a heist to solve.
-Well, we take your mother...

24:13.920 --> 24:15.880
and your daughter with us.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.960
Can you imagine raising your daughter
on a sunny beach?

24:23.000 --> 24:23.960
Raquel...

24:25.240 --> 24:26.920
I don't want this to wear off.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.600
I don't want to ignore this...

24:32.680 --> 24:36.520
this desire to feel alive
that I've never felt so strongly.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.400
You would cross the ocean with a mother,

24:50.080 --> 24:52.440
a daughter and a grandmother?

24:54.400 --> 24:55.600
Right now, I would.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.680
I have a plan B.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.000
Damn.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.720
It's so crazy...

25:14.440 --> 25:15.360
that...

25:17.320 --> 25:19.280
I can't imagine myself
doing anything else.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.120
Finish with the heist.
Do what you have to do.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.240
And then we go.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.080
Okay.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.280
Okay.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.720
Everyone listen up!

26:17.080 --> 26:19.600
We're going to solve this heist
in 24 hours

26:19.680 --> 26:22.560
and get back to our lives.
We've neglected them enough.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.480
Suarez.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.440
Call Chief Sanchez.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.080
I won't let anyone else get killed,
destroyed, or caught.

26:29.160 --> 26:33.200
Nairobi, listen.
Coming as far as you have is epic.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.800
I give you
my most sincere congratulations.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.840
Listen,
I'm going to get you out of there.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.680
Before they catch you all.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.800
Get Lobo and the rest of the UCO here.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.200
What do you have in mind?

26:45.280 --> 26:47.720
I'm starting to think that
the man outside

26:48.080 --> 26:50.120
is the real brains of the operation.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.360
He drew a trail of clues
to lead us to the estate in Toledo.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.160
But I think I know how to catch him.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.000
First, we'll get the hostages
out of the basement.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.360
Thank you. We don't have
enough people to guard the hostages.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.240
Besides, we promised them freedom.
So let them have it.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.960
We'll release them, but give me an hour.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.720
It's a very big spectacle
for such a small audience.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.160
Hi.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.840
I'm going to release 11 hostages,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.080
under one condition.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.720
I want a reporter and a camera
to cover the news from the inside.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.040
Live news feed.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.520
Look,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.880
I'd love to help with your propaganda
but...

27:43.160 --> 27:45.680
I can't force any civilian to go in there.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.640
- You know that very well.
-True.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.760
You're right, Inspector.

27:50.840 --> 27:55.400
You don't have to force anyone.
Just suggest it. I'm sure

27:55.800 --> 27:59.680
many reporters will volunteer
for an interview like that.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.440
-I'll think about it.
-Of course.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.920
Think about it.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.080
But remember I record
these conversations and the last time

28:08.440 --> 28:10.760
you refused to release hostages...

28:11.800 --> 28:14.880
it wasn't taken very well by the public.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.440
But, of course, take your time.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.240
Son of a bitch.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.240
Let's talk about something else.
How can I explain...

28:36.040 --> 28:38.640
-Do you like soccer?
-Oh, yes, soccer.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.080
Professor, in my country soccer is big.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.400
Well, imagine a soccer match.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.840
-Again with soccer?
-Nairobi, listen.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.160
A match in the World Cup.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.840
And Brazil is playing against Cameroon.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.040
-Who wins?
-Easy!

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
Or rather...

28:55.760 --> 28:57.680
who do you want to win?

28:57.760 --> 28:59.240
I'd say Brazil wins.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.200
But I'd root for Cameroon.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.080
-Cameroon.
-Yes.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.320
Cameroon, for sure.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.480
-Cameroon, all the way.
-Look,

29:08.560 --> 29:11.040
by instinct, human beings always,

29:11.880 --> 29:14.720
always sides with the weaker one.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.680
The underdog.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.040
So if we show the world our weaknesses,

29:21.720 --> 29:22.600
our wounds,

29:23.280 --> 29:24.720
that we are on the verge

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
of surrendering.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.360
It will produce a...

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
a shudder.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.640
I think any guy who isn't Brazilian
would go for Cameroon.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.600
-Even some Brazilian guys.
-Or Brazilian girls.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.920
Yes, or Brazilian girls.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.960
Okay, gentlemen. To Cameroon!

29:41.040 --> 29:43.120
How does that soccer chant go?

29:43.200 --> 29:49.040
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

29:49.680 --> 29:52.680
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

29:54.520 --> 29:56.200
Cameroon!

29:56.400 --> 29:57.960
We move on to plan Cameroon.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.480
We'll release the hostages
in the basement.

30:01.720 --> 30:05.720
And we're going to get a reporter
and a camera to record it.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.760
We'll need someone to be interviewed.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.920
And my suggestion

30:12.320 --> 30:13.200
is you, Rio.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.120
I understand your anger,

30:16.360 --> 30:19.160
but we need you.
You can do it without a mask,

30:19.400 --> 30:20.400
you're empathetic.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.160
You think I'll go out on TV?

30:23.560 --> 30:25.160
For Tokyo to see me from jail,

30:25.560 --> 30:26.920
with a big smile,

30:27.400 --> 30:30.120
doing an interview as if nothing
had fucking happened.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.480
Now I'm a hostage.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.720
Don't count on me for anything.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.960
Fuck it, I'll do it.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.560
I'm a natural crybaby,
you can tell just by looking.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.360
You're no crybaby.
You make others cry.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.080
I'll do it.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.800
If I don't have to talk too much,
I'll do it.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.760
You could, but no.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.280
No.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.360
I'll do it with a mask.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.080
With a mask?

31:09.640 --> 31:11.240
On a live interview?

31:13.160 --> 31:15.160
What are we now?
ETA?

31:17.360 --> 31:18.240
Jihadists?

31:18.800 --> 31:19.640
No, no.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.160
This interview has to be done

31:23.720 --> 31:24.640
open-faced.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.560
So all of Spain can feel our eyes,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.360
our breath.
So that they can understand the pain

31:36.120 --> 31:37.560
and a little bit of the sorrow.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.240
Right.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.400
You want to do it.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.240
But you know what the problem is?

31:48.400 --> 31:51.920
If there's someone
who I've never seen feel pain or sorrow

31:52.040 --> 31:53.720
it's you, Berlin.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.040
Tokyo's gone.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.000
Rio doesn't want to do it.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.680
Don't look down on someone
who's good at his job, Nairobi.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.120
I can be a good master of ceremonies.

32:05.720 --> 32:06.640
He's right.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.360
He's good at acting.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.120
Very well.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.800
You'll do it.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.560
HOSPITAL BLUEPRINTS
ENTRANCE

32:21.640 --> 32:24.360
An interview in exchange
for releasing 11 hostages.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.320
I don't know.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.440
It's more justifiable.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.360
We'll be criticized on every front,

32:30.440 --> 32:31.880
but we have to accept it.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.400
Let's take the credit
and sell it as a display of transparency.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.520
You can sell it however you like.
But what about the other thing?

32:40.800 --> 32:43.600
The operation you want to set up
in the hospital.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.240
In exchange for what?
On what evidence?

32:46.320 --> 32:48.080
A plate of fresh anchovies?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.280
On the evidence
that they have a guy outside

32:50.360 --> 32:51.800
who keeps messing with us.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.080
Angel caught him,
and they tried to kill him.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.000
-It was no accident.
-Inspector, we all

32:56.080 --> 32:58.520
read the forensic report
on the accident.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.440
And there's no evidence
of an attempted homicide.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.080
Don't forget he was driving
under the influence.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.560
Fine. You want evidence?

33:06.880 --> 33:08.240
Let's set up the operation.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.560
Let me leak to the press that Angel,
the only one who knows who he is,

33:12.640 --> 33:15.120
will wake up from his coma.
And I guarantee you,

33:15.200 --> 33:16.880
before five in the afternoon,

33:17.080 --> 33:19.680
he will be in the hospital to kill him.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
But we'll be there
to catch him like cat and mouse.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.440
Are you asking me to fill a hospital

33:25.960 --> 33:29.160
with undercover agents,
like some police comic strip?

33:29.640 --> 33:32.000
We should focus our efforts
on the factory.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.200
What about the reporters?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.880
What if they end up hostages too?

33:35.960 --> 33:37.760
That interview is a smokescreen.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.560
A trick to make us waste time.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.760
Chief. Let's, for once,

33:44.200 --> 33:46.720
be the ones who set the trap.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.000
Can't you do it with ten?

33:52.720 --> 33:53.600
Twenty.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.760
Monica Gaztambide,
you're up for treatment.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.280
Let's go.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.240
If you take off the jumpsuit,
maybe I can treat you.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.240
Can you turn around?

34:54.080 --> 34:55.960
Since we're not together anymore, right?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.080
No problem.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.640
Can I?

35:37.080 --> 35:38.040
Wait.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.440
Now.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.360
How's the wound?

36:05.760 --> 36:06.720
It hurts a lot.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.680
And it stings.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.120
We'll get only one chance.
I want him alive.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.880
No one fires unless under extreme danger.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.320
First thing we'll do

36:31.040 --> 36:33.840
is taking Angel to some place safe.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.880
To do this, we'll set up a room
on a different floor.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.480
Once we've moved him,
we'll leak the news of his recovery.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.720
And the target will soon be on the move.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.320
It will bw essential
that everyone is in position.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.760
I want everyone
to get deep into their role.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.520
This is a very complex operation,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.280
so we'll need extreme concentration.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.720
We'll have access
to the surveillance cameras.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.880
I don't want anyone from security
on the floor.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.400
Not even hospital security.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.320
No police cars in the vicinity either.

37:08.440 --> 37:12.320
We'll roll out the fucking red carpet
into Angel's room,

37:12.800 --> 37:14.640
where Lobo will be waiting instead.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.480
And agent Balmaseda
will take Mari Carmen's place.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.360
They'll be there,
ready for a welcome surprise.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.320
And remember,
we're looking for a middle-aged male.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.720
You'll be 20 agents and he'll be alone.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.520
He won't escape.

37:53.000 --> 37:53.920
Did you do it?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.040
It's loaded!

38:11.000 --> 38:11.960
It's loaded.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.240
Stop packing the bills
and stash what you can.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.920
We're out of here!

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Stash them.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.480
Quick!

38:22.480 --> 38:24.960
We're going now. This has lasted too long.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.160
Piece of crap.

38:28.000 --> 38:28.840
Let's go.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.720
Fifth day of the heist.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.000
One hostage
and two officers wounded,

38:43.680 --> 38:44.720
an explosion,

38:45.200 --> 38:46.480
hostages escaped,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.640
and now Channel 6 cameras
are about to enter the place

38:51.120 --> 38:53.680
that the whole world is watching.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.600
Reporters heading for the entrance.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.960
We must remember the historical impact

38:58.040 --> 38:59.440
of this moment.

38:59.520 --> 39:03.280
TV channels from all over
the world are broadcasting our signal...

39:03.360 --> 39:05.440
Cover them until securing entry.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.720
...the first time a TV crew
goes live on...

39:08.800 --> 39:11.120
They're opening the doors.
Attention escorts,

39:11.680 --> 39:14.000
stop at the bottom of the stairs
as requested.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.680
...special at the Royal Mint of Spain.
A crucial moment.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.000
In a minute,
we'll witness something historic

39:20.640 --> 39:24.280
A Channel 6 reporter and cameraman
will enter the site of the heist.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.280
This is as far as the police can go.
From this point on

39:28.960 --> 39:31.800
the reporters will be on their own,
unprotected.

39:32.560 --> 39:37.000
We've never seen such a thing.
All over the country, streets are empty.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.760
Return to your posts.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.040
Good morning.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.320
-Good morning.
-I'm Andres de Fonollosa.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.120
Thank you for being here.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.840
Can you put this on, please?

40:14.800 --> 40:17.560
We're already receiving the signal.
We're going live...

40:17.640 --> 40:19.800
-Raquel.
-...inside the factory.

40:20.520 --> 40:24.520
Mr. Fonollosa, I have to ask
why did you allow a team of journalists

40:25.040 --> 40:26.720
to broadcast live from here.

40:27.600 --> 40:31.520
This is a decisive moment
for all of us in here and...

40:32.520 --> 40:35.720
we needed you here
to record it and to make it public.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.840
Please, come with me. This way.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.120
That's Andres de Fonollosa,

40:40.200 --> 40:41.920
a familiar face to the police.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.560
Bank robber, informer, and
convicted for human trafficking.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.960
These are the 11 hostages

40:47.960 --> 40:49.760
that are going to be released.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
There they are.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.320
I recognize

40:53.240 --> 40:54.200
Manuel García,

40:55.160 --> 40:56.160
Alfonso Martínez,

40:56.640 --> 40:57.640
and María Cornejo.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.280
Looks like they will let them go.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.640
We're all nervous...

41:00.720 --> 41:02.160
Medical services ready.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.240
...like kids waiting
for the school bell to ring.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.960
I want to thank you all.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.520
For the courage and bravery...

41:12.560 --> 41:13.640
you have shown.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.440
And...

41:17.760 --> 41:19.000
and you, especially.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.480
You and your child.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.440
You've proven
to be a strong woman.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.240
Why have you decided

41:26.600 --> 41:27.440
now,

41:27.760 --> 41:29.840
after five days of captivity,

41:30.600 --> 41:31.680
to release hostages?

41:32.000 --> 41:32.920
Five days?

41:33.360 --> 41:34.960
It's hard to believe it's been

41:35.040 --> 41:36.240
a few days, isn't it?

41:41.000 --> 41:41.880
You see...

41:46.040 --> 41:48.560
We confess
that this is a very hard time for us.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.360
The situation is critical.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.920
We have no other option but to surrender.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.760
That's why you're here.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.440
This gesture is the beginning
of the end for everyone.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.240
Helsinki,

42:11.880 --> 42:12.800
it's time.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.520
You can go.

42:17.000 --> 42:17.840
Thank you.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.280
Snipers ready.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.520
Assault Team 1, keep your distance.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.800
Copy that.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.680
We'll release hostages
in order to negociate

42:43.840 --> 42:45.680
the conditions for our surrender.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.800
Have you decided to surrender?

42:47.880 --> 42:50.280
We are aware that we lost.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.160
Open the doors!

42:57.240 --> 42:59.680
Eleven released. We're watching it live..

42:59.760 --> 43:00.920
They're coming out.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.880
At last, good news at the Mint Factory.

43:04.680 --> 43:05.640
There they are.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.840
It's an exciting moment.
It seems like the heist men are giving in.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.640
But there are more headlines, big ones.

43:13.400 --> 43:17.200
Fonollosa has admitted that
the situation is critical,

43:17.280 --> 43:19.720
that they have no alternative
but to surrender.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.320
His literal words were:

43:21.680 --> 43:24.480
"This is the beginning of the end,

43:24.560 --> 43:28.320
and we are aware that we lost".

43:30.720 --> 43:32.720
I don't know if you've ever seen a corpse.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.960
For some of us it's also a first.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.480
You've come here to tell the truth.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.840
Here it is. This is the truth.

43:47.480 --> 43:48.920
We've been beaten.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.360
We've been defeated.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.920
It's important that you confirm it,

43:55.320 --> 43:56.200
please.

43:59.800 --> 44:00.760
Yes.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.880
He doesn't have a pulse. He's dead.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.240
The hostages who escaped
hit him in the head.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.560
He died within a few hours.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.680
Maybe to the people out there,

44:10.760 --> 44:12.480
this man is just a thief.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.000
But to us,
he was a companion and a friend.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.960
Nobody prepares you for that.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.880
Nobody.
It's one of the reasons why

44:23.960 --> 44:25.480
we decided to release hostages.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.680
Some of us here thought
we weren't going to make it out alive.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.520
But I never thought it would be him.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.840
You mean,
there were people in the group...

44:36.200 --> 44:37.840
willing to sacrifice themselves?

44:38.320 --> 44:39.200
No.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.400
No.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.720
Not at all. We're simple people.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.840
We have gone through hardship

44:48.880 --> 44:49.800
of all kinds.

44:50.280 --> 44:51.360
Like anyone else.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.080
Including terminal illness.
And we have had to

44:55.640 --> 44:58.320
take desperate actions like these
in order to

44:58.400 --> 45:00.360
leave something for our families.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.640
For our loved ones.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.200
As a matter of fact,

45:21.280 --> 45:23.880
I have a degenerative disease
called Hellmer's myopathy.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.160
The police knew it.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.720
That didn't stop them
from spreading lies about me.

45:32.200 --> 45:34.320
I'll tell you something,
I may be a thief...

45:35.720 --> 45:39.280
I have always been.
I've robbed banks, jewelry stores,

45:39.360 --> 45:43.000
I've broken into mansions.
But I have never sold anyone.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.320
I've never sold a woman.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.160
I'm not a pimp

45:52.880 --> 45:54.000
who traffics.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.480
Or rapes minors.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.520
I'm not.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.720
Ask the police, when you leave,
in which files are these cases.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.600
You mean the police have lied
to the public?

46:08.480 --> 46:09.800
The police lie!

46:11.840 --> 46:13.640
They lie to the public!

46:14.800 --> 46:16.480
They've lied to my friends.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.720
They've soiled my family name.

46:24.800 --> 46:25.760
I'm a thief.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.800
But I have every right
in the world not to be defamed.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.160
I have the same right as anyone

46:35.800 --> 46:37.000
to die in peace.

46:40.040 --> 46:40.920
With dignity.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.560
I can't go on. Cut.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.840
Please, cut.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.160
That morning we were
a trending topic worldwide.

46:49.680 --> 46:50.960
People went silent

46:51.040 --> 46:52.520
in cafeterias and in taxis.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.720
Fonollosa says the police are lying.

46:55.160 --> 46:58.360
That they have been lying about his past.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.920
And dares them to come up
with legal files.

47:01.120 --> 47:04.160
We were the Cameroon team
barefoot against Brazil.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.440
And everyone was rooting for us.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.640
We're now going to our news colleagues,
Cristina Saavedra. Go ahead.

47:10.840 --> 47:13.240
Breaking news:
Deputy Inspector Ángel Rubio

47:13.320 --> 47:14.680
could wake from his coma.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.720
He was kept in an induced coma
after a car accident.

47:19.760 --> 47:23.640
The Deputy Inspector
suffered an accident on road M-506

47:23.720 --> 47:26.320
when his car crashed
into a construction booth

47:26.400 --> 47:29.240
in one of the lanes, causing it
to roll over multiple times.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.000
Professor,

47:34.080 --> 47:35.280
did you see us on TV?

47:35.360 --> 47:38.680
Nairobi, I want you all to be one,
like a rowing team.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.000
Tell Rio that, as captain of the ship,

47:42.080 --> 47:44.120
I'll get Tokyo out of jail
no matter what.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.880
Yes, sir. That's more like it!

47:46.240 --> 47:47.200
Put Berlin on.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.480
Berlin.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.600
Me?

47:53.520 --> 47:54.400
Yes, you.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.240
Thank you.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.520
Hello?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.840
Deputy Inspector Rubio
is waking from his coma.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.520
What are the odds of that being true?

48:13.000 --> 48:13.920
I don't know.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.600
That's elementary police work:

48:18.000 --> 48:20.480
saying he's waking from his coma
to lure you in.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.160
That doesn't even work on sitcoms.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.600
And what if it's not?

48:35.440 --> 48:38.040
He's the only one who knows who I am.
The only loose end.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.680
What room did they put him in?

48:40.480 --> 48:41.560
Room 119.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.400
It's a trap.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.840
Yes.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.840
There's a 90 per cent chance it's a trap.

48:49.320 --> 48:50.920
Ninety nine percent chance.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.040
Ninety nine percent.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.920
But are we going to leave
one percent to chance?

48:58.160 --> 49:02.880
No, you'll have to make sure.
And if it isn't a trap,

49:03.560 --> 49:04.760
finish him off.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.040
Enter a hospital

49:08.640 --> 49:13.080
in which, surely, there'll be
50 police officers waiting for me?

49:15.000 --> 49:16.760
Sergio, think, damn it.

49:18.080 --> 49:20.720
You spent half your childhood
in a hospital.

49:21.160 --> 49:24.040
How do you walk into a trap
and not get caught,

49:24.120 --> 49:26.400
knowing that the cavalry
is waiting for you?

49:38.440 --> 49:39.480
That would be

49:43.400 --> 49:45.600
by making the cavalry

49:46.840 --> 49:47.960
run away.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.000
