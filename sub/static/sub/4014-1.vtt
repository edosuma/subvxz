04:30.650 --> 04:32.880
- How are you?
- Okay.

04:32.953 --> 04:35.080
Your leg will be fine.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.817
A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.

04:37.891 --> 04:41.019
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

04:41.094 --> 04:42.857
I don't think so.
Here.

04:42.929 --> 04:46.524
- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.502
- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?

04:55.442 --> 04:58.343
Thank you.

05:01.147 --> 05:04.173
- Nurse, I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?

05:04.250 --> 05:07.048
- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.918
Very funny.
Go to sleep now.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.959
- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.

06:34.207 --> 06:37.665
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.

06:44.184 --> 06:47.119
Is there anybody from Picton?

06:47.187 --> 06:50.213
Picton?
I don't know.

06:50.290 --> 06:54.317
I'd like to see somebody from home 
before I go.

07:01.968 --> 07:04.903
- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?

07:04.971 --> 07:07.769
He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario,
right, soldier?

07:07.841 --> 07:11.368
<i>That's where your sweetie's from, 
isn't it? Around there?</i>

07:11.444 --> 07:14.140
Ask him what company he's with.

07:14.214 --> 07:18.412
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.585
Does he know Captain McGan?

07:23.656 --> 07:28.116
He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.

07:28.194 --> 07:30.754
- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.101
<i>Hana, get down!</i>

07:39.906 --> 07:43.034
He's dead. He's dead.

07:45.111 --> 07:48.239
He's dead.

07:48.314 --> 07:50.282
He's dead.

09:13.933 --> 09:17.630
<i>Name, rank, serial number?</i>

09:17.704 --> 09:19.729
<i>No, sorry.</i>

09:19.806 --> 09:22.468
I think I was a pilot.

09:22.542 --> 09:26.137
I was found in the wreckage of a plane
at the beginning of the war.

09:26.212 --> 09:28.146
Can you remember where you were born?

09:28.214 --> 09:30.876
Am I being interrogated?

09:30.950 --> 09:34.750
You should be trying to trick me, 
make me speak German.

09:34.821 --> 09:37.153
- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?

09:37.223 --> 09:39.953
- <i>Are you German?</i>
- No.

09:40.026 --> 09:43.894
<i>How do you know you're not German
if you don't remember anything?</i>

09:43.963 --> 09:46.659
Might-- Might I have a sip of water?

09:58.711 --> 10:00.804
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

10:02.582 --> 10:05.016
I remember lots of things.

10:05.084 --> 10:09.578
I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.

10:09.656 --> 10:13.023
- <i>Nothing between you and France.</i>
- This was your garden?

10:13.092 --> 10:16.027
- Or my wife's.
- <i>You were married then?</i>

10:16.095 --> 10:20.464
I think so. Although I believe that
to be true of a number of Germans.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.603
<i>Look.</i>

10:24.671 --> 10:28.402
I have this much lung.

10:28.474 --> 10:30.908
The rest of my organs are packing up.

10:30.977 --> 10:34.344
What could it possibly matter
if I'm a Tutankhamen?

10:34.414 --> 10:38.373
I'm a bit of... toast, my friend.

10:38.451 --> 10:42.012
Sorry I can't help you.

10:56.369 --> 10:58.564
Are you all right?

10:58.638 --> 11:01.664
I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.

11:06.211 --> 11:08.374
Hana!

11:08.448 --> 11:11.849
- Jan?
- Hana!

11:11.918 --> 11:15.752
There's meant to be lace in the next village. 
The boys are gonna take me.

11:15.822 --> 11:18.222
- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.986
- Just in case there's a sale.
- <i>No.</i>

11:20.059 --> 11:21.686
Hana, I know you do.
Come on.

11:21.761 --> 11:23.319
- No!
- Oh, come on.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.921
I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.

11:25.999 --> 11:28.593
She's a softie.
She loves me.

11:30.903 --> 11:34.066
I'll pay you back! I promise!

11:34.140 --> 11:37.007
I'm not sewing anything else for you.

11:37.076 --> 11:39.271
I love you!

11:39.345 --> 11:42.576
Whoa!
Pienza, boys!

11:59.966 --> 12:01.900
<i>Get some water over here!</i>

12:01.968 --> 12:06.098
Jan!
Oh, no!

12:07.507 --> 12:10.567
<i>Hana, where're you going?</i>

12:10.643 --> 12:13.908
- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!

12:15.014 --> 12:18.245
Stay--

12:21.687 --> 12:23.917
No!

12:23.990 --> 12:26.584
No!

13:11.003 --> 13:13.938
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!

13:14.006 --> 13:15.974
Don't move!
Don't move!

13:16.042 --> 13:18.272
Stand absolutely still!

13:18.344 --> 13:21.074
<i>You're walking in a mine field!</i>

13:23.783 --> 13:26.251
Good.

13:26.319 --> 13:29.152
That's good.

13:29.222 --> 13:32.350
Just stay still for me...

13:32.425 --> 13:34.689
and we'll be fine.

13:36.496 --> 13:38.760
What are you doing?

13:38.831 --> 13:41.994
What the bloody hell 
do you think you're doing?

13:43.202 --> 13:46.137
<i>It's Jan's.</i>

14:13.399 --> 14:16.493
<i>Are you in pain?
Do you need something?</i>

14:16.569 --> 14:18.503
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:20.273 --> 14:22.935
Are you okay?

14:23.009 --> 14:26.274
- You and Jan were--
- We keep moving him in and out of the truck.

14:26.345 --> 14:29.439
Why? He's dying. 
What's the point?

14:29.515 --> 14:32.109
We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?

14:32.185 --> 14:34.779
No, no, I don't mean leave him.

14:43.095 --> 14:46.724
This will help you.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.025
I must be a curse.

14:51.103 --> 14:54.595
Anybody who loves me...

14:55.741 --> 14:58.574
anybody who gets close to me--

14:59.879 --> 15:02.109
Oh, I must be cursed.

15:07.453 --> 15:09.387
Which is it?

16:35.474 --> 16:39.467
- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.

16:39.545 --> 16:43.311
The whole country's crawling 
with bandits and Germans and God knows what.

16:43.382 --> 16:45.873
- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.

16:45.951 --> 16:47.851
How can it be desertion?

16:47.920 --> 16:51.253
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.

16:51.324 --> 16:54.350
This is normal, a shock,
for all of us, Hana.

16:54.427 --> 16:57.828
I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.

17:02.635 --> 17:05.866
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

17:08.941 --> 17:11.704
We're heading for Leghorn.

17:11.777 --> 17:14.075
"Livorno", the Italians call it.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.910
We'll expect you.

17:25.991 --> 17:27.925
Fine.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.634
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

17:39.905 --> 17:42.806
- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.901
I'll catch up.
Good.

18:52.178 --> 18:55.079
What-- What was all that banging?

18:55.147 --> 18:59.777
Are you-- Are you fighting rats
or the entire German army?

19:00.953 --> 19:05.253
No. I was repairing the stairs.

19:05.324 --> 19:09.590
I found a library,
and the books were very useful.

19:09.662 --> 19:13.029
Before you find too many uses for those books,

19:13.098 --> 19:15.566
you might read some to me.

19:15.634 --> 19:18.228
I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.

19:18.304 --> 19:20.966
- What about your own book?
- My book?

19:21.040 --> 19:24.134
Oh, yes, the Herodotus.

19:24.210 --> 19:27.202
<i>Yes, you can read him.</i>

19:27.279 --> 19:30.271
Oh. I found plums.

19:30.349 --> 19:34.115
We have plums in the orchard. 
There.

19:34.186 --> 19:36.984
We have an orchard.

19:37.056 --> 19:41.152
Herodotus is the father of history.

19:41.227 --> 19:43.923
- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.

19:54.273 --> 19:56.207
Hmm.

20:04.283 --> 20:06.547
<i>It's a--</i>

20:06.619 --> 20:09.884
It's a very plum...

20:09.955 --> 20:11.923
plum.

21:36.575 --> 21:41.512
A mountain the shape of a woman's back. 
Good, good.

22:05.604 --> 22:09.131
- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!

22:09.208 --> 22:12.644
- <i>Welcome to the expedition.</i>
- <i>How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.</i>

22:12.711 --> 22:14.110
Splendid to finally meet you all.

22:14.179 --> 22:16.113
This is Dante D'Agostino and Diggy Bermann, 
our archaeologist.

22:16.181 --> 22:18.581
- Beautiful plane.
- This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.

22:18.651 --> 22:21.643
- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.620
<i>We're your new apprentices.</i>

22:23.689 --> 22:26.180
<i>Welcome to the International Sand Club.</i>

22:26.258 --> 22:30.024
- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.

22:30.095 --> 22:32.529
- Marvelous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.

22:32.598 --> 22:35.658
Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.793
We're calling it Rupert Bear.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.270
- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- Almasy.

22:40.339 --> 22:43.740
We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrap heap.

22:43.809 --> 22:46.277
<i>Mrs. Clifton, I'd like to present...</i>

22:46.345 --> 22:49.280
- Count Almasy.
- Hello.

22:49.348 --> 22:52.181
Geoffrey gave me your monograph
and I was reading up in the desert.

22:52.251 --> 22:54.879
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

22:54.953 --> 22:58.354
I wanted to meet the man who could write
a long paper with so few adjectives.

22:58.424 --> 23:02.383
Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.

23:02.461 --> 23:06.397
<i>Big car, slow car,
chauffeur-driven car.</i>

23:06.465 --> 23:09.400
- <i>Broken car.</i>
- It's still a car.

23:09.468 --> 23:12.767
- Not much use, though.
- <i>Love?</i>

23:12.838 --> 23:16.501
Romantic love, platonic love, filial love.

23:16.575 --> 23:19.043
- Quite different things, surely.
- <i>Uxoriousness.</i>

23:19.111 --> 23:23.605
That's my favorite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.

23:23.682 --> 23:27.482
Now there you have me.

23:27.553 --> 23:30.147
- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.

23:30.222 --> 23:32.690
They're highly recommended
by the Royal Geographic Society.

23:32.758 --> 23:34.749
She's charming and has read everything.

23:34.827 --> 23:37.660
- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.

23:37.730 --> 23:39.755
He can make aerial maps of the whole route.

23:39.832 --> 23:42.494
<i>You can't explore from the air, Madox.</i>

23:42.568 --> 23:45.560
<i>If you could explore from the air,
life would be very simple.</i>

23:46.572 --> 23:48.062
Contact.

23:50.142 --> 23:52.110
Contact.

25:08.821 --> 25:11.312
I should try and move the bed.

25:11.390 --> 25:13.881
I want you to be able to see the view.

25:13.959 --> 25:17.190
It's good. 
It's a view from a monastery.

25:17.262 --> 25:20.720
- I can already see.
- How?

25:20.799 --> 25:23.529
- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.

25:23.602 --> 25:26.298
I can't bear the light anyway.

25:26.371 --> 25:28.862
I can see all the way to the desert.

25:28.941 --> 25:30.841
I'm turning you.

25:30.909 --> 25:34.276
Exploring before the war,
making maps.

25:34.346 --> 25:37.577
Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

25:37.649 --> 25:41.176
No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.

25:48.427 --> 25:51.555
I can see my wife in that view.

25:54.032 --> 25:57.024
Are you remembering more?

25:57.102 --> 26:00.367
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?

26:04.543 --> 26:09.310
Why-- Why are you so determined
to keep me alive?

26:09.381 --> 26:12.839
Because I'm a nurse.

27:01.733 --> 27:03.200
<i>Bravo.</i>

27:03.268 --> 27:05.862
<i>We have an old-fashioned tomato</i>

27:05.938 --> 27:08.338
<i>A Long Island potato</i>

27:08.407 --> 27:11.535
<i>But yes
We have no bananas</i>

27:11.610 --> 27:13.874
<i>We have no bananas today</i>

27:26.858 --> 27:28.689
- <i>Next!</i>
- <i>Katharine!</i>

27:28.860 --> 27:31.795
"The King insisted that he would find some way...

27:31.863 --> 27:33.854
"to prove beyond dispute...

27:33.932 --> 27:38.062
"that his wife was fairest of all women.

27:38.136 --> 27:41.765
"'I will hide you in your room where we sleep', 
said Candaules--

27:41.840 --> 27:44.434
- said Candaules."
- Candaules.

27:44.509 --> 27:47.137
"Candaules."

27:47.212 --> 27:49.339
Candaules.

27:49.414 --> 27:53.407
Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen 
has the same practice every night.

27:53.485 --> 27:56.454
She takes off her clothes...

27:56.521 --> 28:00.457
and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.

28:00.525 --> 28:02.993
<i>"And from where you stand,</i>

28:03.061 --> 28:06.588
<i>you will be able to gaze on her 
at your leisure."</i>

28:08.033 --> 28:11.594
And that evening, it's exactly as
the King has told him.

28:11.670 --> 28:13.604
She goes to the chair,

28:13.672 --> 28:15.799
removes her clothes one by one,

28:15.874 --> 28:19.901
until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.

28:19.978 --> 28:24.642
And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.

28:24.716 --> 28:28.311
But then, the Queen looked up...

28:28.387 --> 28:32.517
and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows.

28:32.591 --> 28:35.185
And although she said nothing, she shuddered.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.563
And the next day,

28:43.635 --> 28:47.366
she sends for-- for Gyges and challenged him.

28:47.439 --> 28:51.842
- <i>And hearing his story, this is what she said.</i>
- Off with his head!

28:56.114 --> 28:59.140
She said, 
"Either you must submit to death...

28:59.217 --> 29:02.152
"for gazing on that which you should not,

29:02.220 --> 29:04.745
"or else kill my husband who has shamed me...

29:06.625 --> 29:09.719
<i>and become King in his place."</i>

29:11.930 --> 29:14.558
So Gyges kills the King,

29:14.633 --> 29:18.763
marries the Queen 
and becomes ruler of Lydia for 28 years.

29:20.739 --> 29:22.673
The end.

29:25.310 --> 29:28.040
Shall I spin the bottle?

29:28.113 --> 29:30.707
So, Geoffrey, let that be a lesson to you.

29:30.782 --> 29:33.216
- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!

29:34.419 --> 29:36.853
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

29:37.923 --> 29:40.517
Yes.

29:40.592 --> 29:43.857
No. I'm dropping off.

30:27.438 --> 30:29.305
Go away!

30:29.374 --> 30:32.002
Go! Go!

30:46.725 --> 30:48.693
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

30:49.895 --> 30:52.864
- <i>Hana?</i>
- What do you want?

30:52.931 --> 30:55.866
I met your friend Mary.

30:55.934 --> 30:59.199
She said I should stop and see
if you were all right.

30:59.271 --> 31:04.072
<i>Apparently we're neighbors. 
My house is two blocks from yours in Montreal.</i>

31:04.142 --> 31:06.838
<i>Cabot, north of Laurier.</i>

31:06.912 --> 31:09.779
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

31:12.083 --> 31:14.108
For you.

31:14.186 --> 31:16.381
<i>I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's from Mary.</i>

31:16.454 --> 31:20.049
My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.

31:20.125 --> 31:24.721
Caravaggio they find too absurd to miss out on.

31:24.796 --> 31:26.457
Oh!

31:26.531 --> 31:28.999
Oh!

31:29.067 --> 31:31.297
Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.

31:31.369 --> 31:34.770
<i>Let me do that.</i>

31:40.512 --> 31:43.174
They're fresh.

31:43.248 --> 31:45.682
I haven't had an egg in--

31:48.153 --> 31:50.678
Have you noticed there are chickens?

31:50.755 --> 31:52.950
In Italy, you get chickens but no eggs.

31:53.024 --> 31:55.822
In Africa, they're always eggs
but never chickens.

31:55.894 --> 31:59.330
- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?

31:59.397 --> 32:01.262
Yes, I was.

32:01.333 --> 32:04.302
So was my patient.

32:04.369 --> 32:07.361
Look, I'd like to stay for a while.

32:07.439 --> 32:09.407
I have to do some work here.

32:09.474 --> 32:12.841
<i>I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.</i>

32:12.911 --> 32:16.711
We embrace them and see
if we can relieve them of their weapons,

32:16.781 --> 32:18.840
you know, while we hide.

32:18.917 --> 32:22.478
I was a thief, 
so the army thought I'd be good at it.

32:22.554 --> 32:25.352
- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.

32:25.423 --> 32:28.290
Do you have a problem with those?

32:30.128 --> 32:31.595
No.

32:31.663 --> 32:34.291
- I should look at them before you go.
- <i>Look.</i>

32:34.366 --> 32:36.766
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.

32:36.835 --> 32:39.099
<i>I'll sleep in the stable.</i>

32:39.170 --> 32:41.195
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.

32:41.273 --> 32:44.367
I don't know what Mary told you about me, 
but I don't need company.

32:44.442 --> 32:47.536
I don't need to be looked after.

32:51.683 --> 32:54.914
There is a man downstairs.

32:54.986 --> 32:58.387
He brought us eggs.
He might stay.

32:58.456 --> 33:01.323
Why?
Can he lay eggs?

33:01.393 --> 33:03.486
He's Canadian.

33:03.561 --> 33:07.588
Why are people always so happy 
when they collide with one from the same place?

33:07.666 --> 33:10.567
What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the street?

33:10.635 --> 33:13.729
Did you invite him to live with you?

33:15.140 --> 33:17.438
He needn't disturb you.

33:17.509 --> 33:20.069
He can't.
I'm already disturbed.

33:23.014 --> 33:26.916
There's a war. 
Where you come from becomes important.

33:26.985 --> 33:30.546
<i>Why? I hate that idea.</i>

33:35.694 --> 33:38.663
Ah!
It's gonna work.

33:39.731 --> 33:42.325
<i>Gently.</i>

33:46.404 --> 33:48.372
Can I help?

33:48.440 --> 33:50.340
It's finished.

33:50.408 --> 33:52.672
So, you're our Canadian pickpocket?

33:52.744 --> 33:55.406
<i>Thief</i> I think is more accurate.

33:55.480 --> 34:00.076
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?

34:00.151 --> 34:02.745
Oh, all over.

34:02.821 --> 34:06.086
All over?

34:06.157 --> 34:09.684
I kept trying to cover a very modest portion 
and still failed.

34:09.761 --> 34:12.730
- <i>Are you leaving us?</i>
- Yes.

34:12.797 --> 34:15.357
Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.

34:15.433 --> 34:18.732
Then I'm definitely going.

34:22.306 --> 34:25.139
Does she have war wounds?

34:25.210 --> 34:27.440
I think anybody she ever loves...

34:27.512 --> 34:29.810
<i>tends to die on her.</i>

34:29.880 --> 34:32.907
- <i>Are you planning to be the exception?</i>
- <i>Me?</i>

34:32.984 --> 34:35.282
<i>I think you've got...</i>

34:35.353 --> 34:37.650
the wrong end of the stick, old boy.

34:37.722 --> 34:40.485
<i>So...</i>

34:40.558 --> 34:42.492
<i>Caravaggio.</i>

34:42.560 --> 34:45.824
Hana thinks you invented your name.

34:45.897 --> 34:48.491
And you've forgotten yours.

34:48.565 --> 34:53.697
I said that no one would ever invent
such a preposterous name.

34:53.772 --> 34:56.103
And I said you can forget everything,

34:57.675 --> 35:00.644
but you never forget your name.

35:00.712 --> 35:03.078
Count Almasy.

35:03.148 --> 35:05.480
<i>That name mean anything to you?</i>

35:05.550 --> 35:07.916
<i>Or Katharine Clifton?</i>

35:16.528 --> 35:18.462
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:18.530 --> 35:21.693
- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.

35:21.766 --> 35:25.668
They don't see foreign women in this market. 
How much did you pay?

35:25.737 --> 35:28.433
Um, £7, £8, I suppose.

35:28.506 --> 35:30.940
- Which store?
- Why?

35:31.009 --> 35:34.376
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.

35:34.446 --> 35:36.380
I don't want to take it back.

35:36.448 --> 35:39.679
- This is not worth £8.
- It is to me.

35:39.751 --> 35:42.242
- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.515
That insults them.

35:46.124 --> 35:49.821
I don't believe that. 
I think that you're insulted by me somehow.

35:49.894 --> 35:53.261
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.

35:53.331 --> 35:56.027
I apologize if I appear abrupt.

35:56.100 --> 35:58.500
I'm rusty at social graces.

36:02.941 --> 36:04.966
How do you find Cairo?

36:05.043 --> 36:08.843
- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.

36:08.913 --> 36:11.575
Or the Sphinx?

36:14.786 --> 36:19.120
<i>Latitude, 25, 33.
Longitude, 25, 16.</i>

36:19.190 --> 36:23.126
<i>We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer,
we'll leave our bones in the desert.</i>

36:23.194 --> 36:25.628
- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.

36:25.697 --> 36:27.756
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

36:27.832 --> 36:29.925
- How is your charming wife?
- <i>Marvelous.</i>

36:30.001 --> 36:32.299
She's in love with the hotel plumbing.

36:32.370 --> 36:34.497
<i>She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.</i>

36:34.572 --> 36:37.507
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.

36:37.575 --> 36:40.703
Actually, she's just outside.

36:42.113 --> 36:44.343
Chaps only in the Long Bar.

36:48.786 --> 36:50.754
Mrs. Clifton.

36:50.822 --> 36:55.282
<i>You'll have to forgive us. 
We're not accustomed to the company of women.</i>

36:55.360 --> 36:59.057
Not at all. 
I was thoroughly enjoying my book.

36:59.130 --> 37:01.997
- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?

37:02.066 --> 37:05.399
I'm afraid we're not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.404
Oh. Well, what'll you do?

37:07.472 --> 37:09.906
More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.

37:09.974 --> 37:12.966
- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.

37:13.044 --> 37:15.035
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

37:15.113 --> 37:18.241
Very much so.
We all are.

37:18.316 --> 37:20.750
- <i>Save my friend Almasy here.</i>
- I feel much better.

37:20.818 --> 37:24.549
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.

37:24.622 --> 37:26.749
Let's toast, then.
Absent wives.

37:26.824 --> 37:29.554
- Absent wives.
- And present ones.

37:29.627 --> 37:31.254
And future ones.

37:52.317 --> 37:54.251
Thank you.

37:54.319 --> 37:57.117
Excuse me.
May I?

38:11.769 --> 38:15.170
- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?

38:15.239 --> 38:17.833
After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.

38:17.909 --> 38:22.039
I was concerned. 
A woman in that part of Cairo, a European woman.

38:22.113 --> 38:24.604
- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?

38:24.682 --> 38:27.549
As the wife of one of our party.

38:27.619 --> 38:30.679
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.

38:30.755 --> 38:34.020
But following me is predatory, isn't it?

39:16.801 --> 39:19.861
Could I ask you to move?

39:20.938 --> 39:23.065
I'm sorry, but I--

39:24.876 --> 39:27.845
I'm sorry.
Of course.

39:27.912 --> 39:30.847
- <i>It's just when you move.</i>
- How stupid of me.

39:30.915 --> 39:35.545
- I can't really bear the pressure--
- Are you all right?

39:35.620 --> 39:37.952
I was dreaming.
Awful.

40:28.706 --> 40:30.640
Hana.

40:33.344 --> 40:36.939
Hana, are you all right?

40:37.014 --> 40:39.608
Leave me alone.

41:00.671 --> 41:02.935
You're in love with him, aren't you?

41:03.007 --> 41:06.067
<i>Your poor patient.</i>

41:06.144 --> 41:09.079
<i>You think he's a saint
because of the way he looks.</i>

41:09.147 --> 41:12.241
I don't think he is.

41:12.316 --> 41:14.614
I'm not so in love with him.

41:14.685 --> 41:18.985
I'm in love with ghosts.

41:19.056 --> 41:22.150
So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.

41:22.226 --> 41:24.524
What if I told you he did this to me?

41:27.698 --> 41:31.031
How could he have?
When?

41:31.102 --> 41:33.662
I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.

41:33.738 --> 41:37.640
- I don't know what that means.
- <i>Ask your saint who he is.</i>

41:38.643 --> 41:40.975
Ask him who he's killed.

41:44.248 --> 41:48.685
Please, don't creep around this house.

41:48.753 --> 41:51.153
<i>See, I don't think
he's forgotten anything!</i>

41:51.222 --> 41:54.089
<i>I think he wants to forget!</i>

41:56.027 --> 41:58.325
<i>Gentlemen, to mapmaking.</i>

41:58.396 --> 42:00.296
To mapmaking!

42:00.364 --> 42:02.730
And a special thank you 
to Geoffrey and Katharine,

42:02.800 --> 42:06.998
without whose fund-raising heroics,
we'd still be kicking our heels.

42:07.071 --> 42:09.505
- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.

42:09.574 --> 42:13.670
Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?

42:13.744 --> 42:16.508
Return the favor.
Take a few photographs for the army.

42:16.581 --> 42:18.981
Oh, um, what kind of photographs?

42:19.050 --> 42:20.984
Portraits.

42:21.052 --> 42:23.520
The brigadier, the brigadier's wife,

42:23.588 --> 42:27.615
the brigadier's dog, brigadier by the pyramids, 
brigadier breathing.

42:27.692 --> 42:30.183
<i>And I shall, of course, be bereft.</i>

42:30.261 --> 42:33.094
I'll finally be able to explore 
the Cairo nightlife.

42:33.164 --> 42:36.099
I shall produce an authoritative guide
to the zinc bars and--

42:36.167 --> 42:38.897
I want to say <i>hareems</i>. 
Are we in the right country for <i>hareems</i> ?

42:38.970 --> 42:40.938
<i>Harems.</i>

42:46.043 --> 42:48.603
- Bye, my love.
- Keep safe.

42:48.679 --> 42:50.943
Catch up in a week.

42:53.584 --> 42:56.917
Clifton, safe journey.

42:56.988 --> 43:01.254
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.

43:01.325 --> 43:04.294
Clifton.

43:07.398 --> 43:09.992
This is probably none of my business.

43:10.067 --> 43:12.900
Your wife.

43:12.970 --> 43:16.269
- Think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?

43:16.340 --> 43:20.106
Well, the desert is, it's, uh--
for a woman, it's very tough.

43:20.177 --> 43:22.441
I wonder if it's not too much for her.

43:22.513 --> 43:25.004
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.

43:25.082 --> 43:28.108
- All the same, were I you--
- I've known Katharine since she was three.

43:28.185 --> 43:30.881
We were practically brother and sister
before we were man and wife.

43:30.955 --> 43:33.389
I think I'd know what is and what isn't
too much for her.

43:33.457 --> 43:36.290
I think she'd know herself.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.328
Very well.

43:38.396 --> 43:41.297
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?

44:23.941 --> 44:26.136
I have come to love...

44:26.210 --> 44:30.010
that little tap of the fingernail 
against the syringe.

44:31.082 --> 44:33.812
Tap.

44:33.884 --> 44:36.751
Tap.

44:36.821 --> 44:38.755
Tap.

44:59.477 --> 45:03.106
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.

45:07.785 --> 45:10.720
I don't have the key to that door. You--

45:13.657 --> 45:16.922
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.

45:16.994 --> 45:19.462
They left mines everywhere.

45:19.530 --> 45:22.021
And pianos were their favorite hiding places.

45:22.099 --> 45:24.533
I see.
Sorry.

45:29.840 --> 45:33.606
Then maybe you're safe
as long as you only play Bach.

45:35.046 --> 45:37.276
He's German.

45:38.482 --> 45:41.178
Is something funny?

45:41.252 --> 45:43.652
No. I'm sorry.

45:58.269 --> 46:00.567
I've met you before.

46:00.638 --> 46:04.130
I don't think so.

46:14.385 --> 46:16.353
Look. See?

46:16.420 --> 46:19.446
Move that, and no more Bach.

46:19.523 --> 46:22.959
Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?

46:23.027 --> 46:25.495
<i>Fine, Sergeant.</i>

46:25.563 --> 46:27.463
So you're working with the Italians.

46:27.531 --> 46:29.624
Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.

46:29.700 --> 46:32.396
<i>I was a thief,
so the army thought I'd be good at it.</i>

46:32.470 --> 46:34.870
<i>I like the Italians.</i>

46:34.939 --> 46:37.237
<i>He wants us to move out.</i>

46:37.308 --> 46:40.800
He says there could be 50 more mines 
in the building.

46:40.878 --> 46:45.247
<i>He thinks I'm mad
because I laugh at him.</i>

46:45.316 --> 46:48.308
He's Indian.

46:48.385 --> 46:52.219
- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.

46:52.289 --> 46:54.723
<i>If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.</i>

46:54.792 --> 46:56.817
I'll probably marry him.

46:56.894 --> 47:00.091
Really?
That's sudden.

47:00.164 --> 47:02.155
My mother always told me...

47:02.233 --> 47:05.964
I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.

47:12.176 --> 47:16.112
- I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?

47:16.180 --> 47:18.910
With his sergeant, a Mr. Hardy.

47:20.284 --> 47:24.243
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

47:24.321 --> 47:28.257
They have to clear all the roads of mines. 
That's a big job.

47:28.325 --> 47:31.522
<i>In that case, 
I-- I suppose we can't charge.</i>

47:31.595 --> 47:34.086
No, we can't.

47:36.967 --> 47:39.435
Thank you.

48:19.176 --> 48:21.610
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

48:26.517 --> 48:29.213
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

48:29.286 --> 48:31.811
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

48:31.889 --> 48:36.258
I've been thinking. How does someone like you 
decide to come to the desert?

48:36.327 --> 48:38.227
What is it? You--

48:38.295 --> 48:41.560
You're doing whatever you're doing in your castle, 
or wherever it is you live,

48:41.632 --> 48:45.295
and one day you say,
"I have to get to the desert", or what?

48:45.369 --> 48:50.102
I once traveled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.

48:50.174 --> 48:54.042
He didn't speak for nine hours.

48:56.547 --> 49:01.246
<i>At the end of it, 
he pointed at the horizon and said, "Faya".</i>

49:01.318 --> 49:04.253
That was a good day.

49:14.898 --> 49:17.458
Actually, you sing.

49:19.303 --> 49:21.794
- What?
- You sing.

49:21.872 --> 49:24.340
All the time.

49:24.408 --> 49:26.535
- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.

49:27.911 --> 49:29.879
Al Auf!

49:41.792 --> 49:44.784
<i>You'd better be ready 
about half past 8:00</i>

49:44.862 --> 49:47.057
<i>Remember, honey
Don't be late</i>

49:47.131 --> 49:50.897
<i>'Cause I'll be there
when the band starts playing</i>

49:50.968 --> 49:52.993
<i>Gonna dance off both my shoes</i>

49:53.070 --> 49:55.470
<i>When they play the Jelly Roll blues</i>

49:55.539 --> 50:00.306
<i>Tomorrow night at the 
dark-town strutter's ball</i>

50:12.823 --> 50:15.417
Give me your hand.

50:17.328 --> 50:19.262
Thanks.

51:55.392 --> 51:58.122
<i>Madox!</i>

51:58.195 --> 52:00.220
<i>Madox!</i>

52:00.297 --> 52:02.231
<i>Madox!</i>

52:02.299 --> 52:05.666
- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?

52:05.736 --> 52:09.695
D'Ag! Bermann!
Quick!

52:26.924 --> 52:28.915
My God.

52:30.627 --> 52:32.891
They're swimming.

52:37.935 --> 52:40.369
<i>They're swimming.</i>

53:09.132 --> 53:11.191
Ow!

53:14.037 --> 53:17.404
- You okay?
- Yeah.

53:42.604 --> 53:44.765
<i>How do you explain...</i>

53:44.839 --> 53:48.104
to someone who has never been here,

53:48.176 --> 53:52.704
feelings which seem quite normal?

53:55.784 --> 53:59.117
I don't know, my friend.

53:59.187 --> 54:01.712
I don't know.

54:05.193 --> 54:07.491
- Aaah!
- Kamal!

54:07.562 --> 54:09.655
<i>Bermann, what are you doing?</i>

54:09.731 --> 54:11.858
Bermann!

54:13.635 --> 54:15.830
Watch out!
Watch out!

54:25.647 --> 54:29.083
- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!

54:29.150 --> 54:31.516
Almasy, are you all right?

54:31.586 --> 54:34.646
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

54:36.291 --> 54:39.317
My wrist!
Ah!

54:53.007 --> 54:57.842
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.

54:57.912 --> 55:00.176
Try to get an additional radiator.

55:00.248 --> 55:05.151
We can store it between here and Pottery Hill. 
And a better jack.

55:05.220 --> 55:08.678
- We planned badly.
- Bermann?

55:22.137 --> 55:24.037
Safe journey.

55:26.708 --> 55:28.801
Now what?

55:28.877 --> 55:32.108
<i>Let's get all this stuff off.</i>

55:32.180 --> 55:35.149
- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.

55:35.216 --> 55:38.151
- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.

55:38.219 --> 55:41.086
<i>No, I insist. 
There clearly isn't room for all of us.</i>

55:41.156 --> 55:44.125
I'm the least able to dig, 
and I'm not one of the walking wounded.

55:44.192 --> 55:46.126
It's only one night.

55:46.194 --> 55:49.630
If I remain, it's the most effective method 
of persuading my husband...

55:49.697 --> 55:53.133
to abandon whatever he's doing
and come and rescue us.

55:53.201 --> 55:55.795
- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.

56:40.048 --> 56:43.449
I thought you might like to paste them 
into your book.

56:50.191 --> 56:52.659
<i>Well, we--</i>

56:52.727 --> 56:55.195
We took photographs.

56:57.398 --> 56:59.696
There's no need.

57:00.835 --> 57:03.395
No, really.
I'd like you to have them.

57:03.471 --> 57:05.962
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um--

57:06.040 --> 57:09.840
<i>This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.</i>

57:09.911 --> 57:13.642
I should feel obliged.
Thank you.

57:28.296 --> 57:31.424
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?

57:31.499 --> 57:34.093
To feel any obligation.

57:37.305 --> 57:40.240
Yes, of course it would.

58:09.704 --> 58:12.229
You should come into the shelter.

58:12.307 --> 58:14.298
I'm quite all right, thank you.

58:14.375 --> 58:18.243
- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?

58:18.313 --> 58:20.679
Do you see what's happening to them,
the stars?

58:20.748 --> 58:24.240
- They're so untidy. I was trying to rearrange them.
- <i>No, no.</i>

58:24.319 --> 58:26.287
Over there.

58:30.291 --> 58:32.885
<i>In a few minutes, there'll be no stars.</i>

58:32.960 --> 58:35.326
The air is filling with sand.

59:38.459 --> 59:42.088
- This is not very good, is it?
- No.

59:45.500 --> 59:49.129
- Will we be all right?
- Yes.

59:49.203 --> 59:51.137
Yes.

59:52.140 --> 59:54.404
Absolutely.

59:54.475 --> 59:57.842
"Yes" is a comfort.
"Absolutely" is not.

01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:17.362
<i>Let me tell you about winds.</i>

01:00:17.432 --> 01:00:20.299
<i>There is a, a whirlwind
from southern Morocco,</i>

01:00:20.368 --> 01:00:22.632
the Aajej,

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:26.469
against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.

01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:32.145
And there is a, a Ghibli from Tunis.

01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:34.545
- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.

01:00:34.615 --> 01:00:38.381
Which rolls and rolls and rolls 
and produces a--

01:00:38.453 --> 01:00:41.911
a rather strange nervous condition.

01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:48.118
And then there is the, the Harmatten,

01:00:48.196 --> 01:00:52.997
a red wind, which mariners call
"the sea of darkness".

01:00:54.268 --> 01:00:56.259
And red sand from this wind...

01:00:56.337 --> 01:00:59.238
has flown as far as
the south coast of England,

01:00:59.307 --> 01:01:01.741
apparently producing...

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:05.210
showers so dense that they were
mistaken for blood.

01:01:05.279 --> 01:01:08.043
Fiction!

01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:12.142
We have a house on that coast
and it has never, never rained blood.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.155
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.

01:01:15.223 --> 01:01:17.487
- My friend.
- Your fri--

01:01:17.558 --> 01:01:20.152
He writes about it...

01:01:20.228 --> 01:01:23.686
and he writes about...

01:01:23.764 --> 01:01:27.165
a, a wind, the Simoon,

01:01:27.235 --> 01:01:29.931
which a nation thought was so evil,

01:01:30.004 --> 01:01:33.440
they declared war on it
and marched out against it.

01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:37.141
In full battle dress.

01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:42.214
<i>Their swords raised.</i>

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:10.477
Katharine, Katharine, 
I need to get out your side, quickly.

01:02:10.545 --> 01:02:12.911
A car!
Let me out!

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.744
Of course.
I'm sorry.

01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:18.046
Ridiculous to fall asleep!

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:20.178
Unforgivable!

01:02:20.254 --> 01:02:22.688
Damn!
The flare!

01:02:24.058 --> 01:02:25.992
Stop!
Over here!

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.290
<i>Here!</i>

01:02:28.362 --> 01:02:30.853
Stop!

01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:34.060
Madox!

01:02:34.135 --> 01:02:37.536
<i>Madox! Madox!</i>

01:02:51.052 --> 01:02:53.247
Our tracks have disappeared.

01:02:53.321 --> 01:02:56.813
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.

01:03:01.796 --> 01:03:04.765
Could I ask you, please, to...

01:03:04.832 --> 01:03:08.268
paste your paintings into my book.

01:03:08.336 --> 01:03:10.531
<i>I-- I should like to have them.</i>

01:03:10.605 --> 01:03:13.073
I should be honored.

01:03:15.743 --> 01:03:18.906
The others!

01:03:20.081 --> 01:03:22.572
- Oh, God.
- <i>Quick!</i>

01:03:26.687 --> 01:03:30.521
Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.

01:03:30.591 --> 01:03:33.321
Quick!
Get the other shovel!

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:39.900
Am I a terrible coward to ask 
how much water we have left?

01:03:39.967 --> 01:03:43.926
A little in our can. We have, uh, 
water in the radiator, which can be drunk.

01:03:44.005 --> 01:03:48.203
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.

01:03:48.275 --> 01:03:51.642
We, uh-- Oh, come on!
Come on!

01:03:51.712 --> 01:03:55.739
There's also a plant.

01:03:55.816 --> 01:04:00.185
I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut 
a piece the size of a heart from this plant,

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:03.690
and the next morning it'll be filled
with a delicious liquid.

01:04:03.758 --> 01:04:07.592
Find that plant, cut out its heart.

01:04:11.532 --> 01:04:14.467
Here.

01:04:19.807 --> 01:04:22.173
Here's the window.

01:04:22.243 --> 01:04:25.212
<i>Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.
Mind your hands.</i>

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:28.339
It's okay. We're here.

01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:30.976
Come on, clear it quickly.

01:04:33.054 --> 01:04:36.046
Hang on.
Coming.

01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:48.528
- I've got it. I've got it.
- Help them out. Here.

01:05:58.739 --> 01:06:01.105
<i>Katharine.</i>

01:06:05.946 --> 01:06:07.880
<i>Water.</i>

01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:26.429
<i>Geoffrey's not in Cairo.</i>

01:06:29.837 --> 01:06:32.670
He's not actually a buffoon.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.731
The plane wasn't a wedding present.

01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:37.505
It belongs to the British government.

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:40.945
They want aerial maps
of the whole of North Africa.

01:06:41.015 --> 01:06:43.779
So I think he's in Ethiopia.

01:06:45.853 --> 01:06:49.050
In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.

01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:55.721
And the marriage.

01:06:55.796 --> 01:06:58.060
Is that a fiction?

01:07:00.534 --> 01:07:03.128
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

01:07:08.142 --> 01:07:11.202
Oh, thank God.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:13.303
Thank God.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.440
Madox.
It's Madox.

01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:24.522
Am I K in your book?

01:07:24.592 --> 01:07:26.856
I think I must be.

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.541
<i>Chapter one.</i>

01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:56.249
<i>"He sat in defiance of municipal orders
astride the gun Zamzammah--"</i>

01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:59.884
<i>I can't read these words. I can't read them. 
They stick in my throat.</i>

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.360
<i>Because you're reading it too fast.</i>

01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:05.227
- Not at all.
- <i>You have to read Kipling slowly.</i>

01:08:05.299 --> 01:08:09.133
<i>Your eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.</i>

01:08:09.203 --> 01:08:12.229
What is it?
"He sat, comma,

01:08:12.306 --> 01:08:15.503
<i>"in defiance of municipal orders, comma,</i>

01:08:15.576 --> 01:08:18.545
"astride the gun Zamzammah...

01:08:18.612 --> 01:08:22.377
on her brick--"
What is it?

01:08:22.448 --> 01:08:25.282
"Brick platform,
opposite the old Ajaib-Gher."

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:30.187
<i>"The wonder house, comma,</i>

01:08:30.256 --> 01:08:33.852
as the natives called the Lahore Museum."

01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:37.193
<i>It's still there, the cannon,
outside the museum.</i>

01:08:37.264 --> 01:08:41.064
Made of metal cups and bowls taken
from every household in the city as tax,

01:08:41.135 --> 01:08:43.399
then melted down.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:47.531
Then later, they fired the cannon 
at my people,

01:08:47.608 --> 01:08:51.374
comma, the natives.

01:08:51.444 --> 01:08:53.379
Full stop.

01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:57.383
What exactly is it you object to?

01:08:57.451 --> 01:09:00.352
The writer, or what he's writing about?

01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:04.288
What I really object to, Uncle,

01:09:04.358 --> 01:09:06.656
is your finishing all my condensed milk.

01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:09.662
And the message everywhere in your book,
however slowly I read it,

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.858
that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.

01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:16.300
Hana, we have discovered a shared pleasure, 
the boy and I.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.930
- Arguing about books?
- <i>Condensed milk.</i>

01:09:19.006 --> 01:09:21.236
One of the truly great inventions.

01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:24.209
I'll get another tin.

01:09:24.278 --> 01:09:27.907
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.

01:09:27.982 --> 01:09:31.439
Too many men.
Just like this house.

01:09:31.518 --> 01:09:34.953
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.

01:09:35.022 --> 01:09:37.456
No, I don't think it does.

01:09:37.524 --> 01:09:40.015
Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:43.221
<i>I don't think it's indifference.</i>

01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:45.787
- <i>Hana was just telling me, you're indifferent...</i>
- Hey!

01:09:45.866 --> 01:09:47.959
to her cooking.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.426
Well, I'm indifferent to cooking.

01:09:51.505 --> 01:09:54.303
Not Hana's cooking in particular.

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:57.640
Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

01:09:59.713 --> 01:10:02.614
They're very good with salt.

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.434
Welcome back, Madam.

01:10:38.118 --> 01:10:40.109
Will you not come in?

01:10:40.187 --> 01:10:42.382
No.

01:10:42.456 --> 01:10:45.516
- <i>I should go home.</i>
- Will you please come in?

01:10:46.727 --> 01:10:48.661
Mrs. Clifton.

01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:53.793
Don't.

01:10:53.867 --> 01:10:55.835
I believe you still have my book.

01:11:11.885 --> 01:11:13.910
Thank you.

01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:41.040
You still have sand in your hair.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:07.399
<i>It wouldn't be make-believe</i>

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:10.868
<i>If you believe in me</i>

01:13:10.938 --> 01:13:14.430
<i>Without your love</i>

01:13:14.508 --> 01:13:16.874
I'm impressed you can sew.

01:13:16.944 --> 01:13:18.878
Good.

01:13:25.953 --> 01:13:28.581
You sew very badly.

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:30.987
Well, you don't sew at all.

01:13:31.058 --> 01:13:32.992
A woman should never learn to sew,

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.654
and if she can,
she shouldn't admit to it.

01:13:43.437 --> 01:13:46.463
Close your eyes.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.566
It makes it harder still.

01:13:52.379 --> 01:13:54.313
Hmm.

01:13:57.784 --> 01:14:00.048
When were you most happy?

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.816
Now.

01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:06.489
And when were you least happy?

01:14:09.062 --> 01:14:11.053
Now.

01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:17.834
- What do you love?
- What do I love?

01:14:17.904 --> 01:14:21.931
- Say everything.
- Let's see.

01:14:22.009 --> 01:14:24.102
- Water.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:14:26.413 --> 01:14:29.109
Fish in it.

01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:32.083
And hedgehogs.
I love hedgehogs.

01:14:32.152 --> 01:14:34.086
And what else?

01:14:34.154 --> 01:14:37.089
Marmite.
I'm addicted.

01:14:38.859 --> 01:14:42.158
And baths.
But not with other people.

01:14:46.867 --> 01:14:48.926
Islands.

01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:53.472
And your handwriting.

01:14:55.442 --> 01:14:58.468
- Mmm.
- I could go on all day.

01:14:58.545 --> 01:15:00.536
Go on all day.

01:15:08.555 --> 01:15:10.887
My husband.

01:15:12.826 --> 01:15:15.260
And what do you hate most?

01:15:18.899 --> 01:15:21.163
A lie.

01:15:22.469 --> 01:15:25.666
What do you hate most?

01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:31.503
Ownership.

01:15:31.578 --> 01:15:33.671
Being owned.

01:15:34.848 --> 01:15:37.612
When you leave,
you should forget me.

01:16:07.748 --> 01:16:11.206
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- <i>Don't you recognize me?</i>

01:16:11.284 --> 01:16:15.015
Is it you? So fat.

01:16:20.127 --> 01:16:22.391
- Hmm.
- <i>That's a Christmas cracker.</i>

01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:24.555
<i>Firecracker.</i>

01:16:24.631 --> 01:16:27.566
- This isn't your handwriting, is it?
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

01:16:29.136 --> 01:16:31.900
"December 22nd.

01:16:31.972 --> 01:16:35.464
"Betrayals in war are childlike...

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:38.705
"compared with our betrayals during peace.

01:16:38.779 --> 01:16:43.045
"New lovers are nervous and tender...

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:46.448
"but smash everything.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.583
<i>For the heart is an organ of fire."</i>

01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:57.287
"For the heart is an organ of fire."

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.966
I love that.

01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:07.029
I believe that.

01:17:08.341 --> 01:17:10.275
K?

01:17:11.645 --> 01:17:14.580
- Who is K?
- <i>K...</i>

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:18.316
is for Katharine.

01:17:28.962 --> 01:17:31.055
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:40.268
- Say you're sick.
- What? No.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.309
Say you're feeling faint.
The heat.

01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:46.243
- No.
- I can't work.

01:17:46.313 --> 01:17:50.579
- I can't sleep.
- <i>Katharine.</i>

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.811
Coming.

01:17:54.354 --> 01:17:57.687
I can't sleep. I wake up shouting
in the middle of the night.

01:17:57.757 --> 01:18:02.091
- Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, trauma.
- I can still taste you.

01:18:05.665 --> 01:18:08.634
- Fill up this. It's empty.
- Oh.

01:18:08.702 --> 01:18:12.570
I try to write,
with your taste in my mouth.

01:18:15.842 --> 01:18:18.777
Swoon.

01:18:18.845 --> 01:18:21.473
They'll catch you.

01:18:24.184 --> 01:18:27.449
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:18:37.397 --> 01:18:40.628
- Come along with me now!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.691
Merry Christmas!

01:18:42.769 --> 01:18:45.704
- <i>Katharine! Oh, my goodness!</i>
- Oh.

01:18:45.772 --> 01:18:47.797
<i>Fetch a chair.</i>

01:18:47.874 --> 01:18:49.842
No, I'm fine.

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:52.174
- It's this heat. It's terrible.
- Is she all right?

01:18:52.245 --> 01:18:55.078
- She's quite all right.
- Oh, good.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.912
- Are you pregnant?
- Oh, I don't think so, no.

01:18:57.984 --> 01:18:59.975
How romantic.

01:19:00.053 --> 01:19:02.385
With Fiona, I fell over 
every five minutes.

01:19:02.455 --> 01:19:05.549
Ronnie christened me "Lady Downfall."

01:19:05.625 --> 01:19:09.789
Do you know, I think I might go inside
and sit down for a few minutes.

01:19:09.863 --> 01:19:12.957
- I'll come with you.
- No, I'll be all right. You stay here.

01:19:13.033 --> 01:19:15.365
Are you sure?

01:20:01.147 --> 01:20:05.584
<i>Silent night</i>

01:20:05.652 --> 01:20:09.952
<i>Holy night</i>

01:20:10.023 --> 01:20:13.925
<i>All is calm</i>

01:20:13.994 --> 01:20:18.693
<i>All is bright</i>

01:20:18.765 --> 01:20:23.395
<i>Round yon virgin</i>

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:26.405
<i>And her child</i>

01:20:39.719 --> 01:20:45.055
<i>Silent night</i>

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:49.118
<i>Holy night</i>

01:20:49.195 --> 01:20:54.428
<i>All is calm</i>

01:20:54.501 --> 01:20:58.528
<i>All is bright</i>

01:21:28.435 --> 01:21:35.637
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

01:21:38.578 --> 01:21:41.172
Happy Christmas!

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:48.010
<i>God save our gracious king</i>

01:21:48.088 --> 01:21:50.784
- Have you seen Katharine?
- What?

01:21:50.857 --> 01:21:53.121
- It's Clifton under here.
- <i>Oh.</i>

01:21:53.193 --> 01:21:56.060
No, I haven't. Sorry.

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:01.032
<i>Send him victorious</i>

01:22:01.101 --> 01:22:04.298
Darling, I just heard.

01:22:05.972 --> 01:22:08.406
You poor sausage.
Are you all right?

01:22:08.475 --> 01:22:11.069
I'm fine.
I'm just too hot.

01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:13.612
Lady H thought you might be pregnant.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.673
I'm not pregnant. I'm just hot.
Too hot, like you.

01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:20.720
I'm sweltering, in fact.

01:22:23.323 --> 01:22:26.588
Come on, I'll take you home.

01:22:26.659 --> 01:22:31.221
Can we really go home?
I can't breathe.

01:22:31.297 --> 01:22:35.165
<i>I am dying for green.
Anything green, or rain.</i>

01:22:35.235 --> 01:22:40.366
It's Christmas and it's all--
Oh, I don't know.

01:22:45.011 --> 01:22:49.107
If you asked me, I'd go home tomorrow.
If you wanted.

01:22:49.182 --> 01:22:53.141
Darling, you know we can't go home.
There might be a war.

01:22:58.458 --> 01:23:01.894
Oh, Geoffrey,
you do so love a disguise.

01:23:01.961 --> 01:23:03.952
I do so love you.

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:08.333
Mmm.

01:23:09.602 --> 01:23:12.537
- What do you smell of?
- What?

01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:18.807
Marzipan. I think you've got marzipan 
in your hair.

01:23:18.878 --> 01:23:21.369
No wonder you're homesick.

01:23:43.069 --> 01:23:45.003
Is it you?

01:23:46.072 --> 01:23:47.505
What?

01:23:48.808 --> 01:23:50.799
If I said "Moose"--

01:23:50.877 --> 01:23:53.846
Moose?
Who the hell's Moose?

01:23:56.683 --> 01:23:58.742
I look different.

01:23:58.818 --> 01:24:01.252
Why shouldn't you?

01:24:07.327 --> 01:24:09.386
<i>I heard your breathing.</i>

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:13.421
I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.

01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:16.730
Well, I'm dying anyway, but I--

01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:20.136
I long for the rain on my face.

01:24:20.206 --> 01:24:23.232
First wedding anniversary,
what do you call it?

01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:26.767
Ha, I don't know.
Paper?

01:24:26.846 --> 01:24:30.145
<i>Is it?
I don't know.</i>

01:24:30.216 --> 01:24:32.150
Paper.

01:24:33.218 --> 01:24:34.584
Paper?

01:24:34.654 --> 01:24:36.815
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:39.518
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Now don't sulk. I'll be back tomorrow evening.

01:24:39.592 --> 01:24:42.425
<i>I'm going to sulk, and I'm not moving
till you get back here.</i>

01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:44.520
Promise?
That's good.

01:24:44.597 --> 01:24:47.031
Okay, my sausage, I love you.

01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:52.971
- I didn't know you were going anywhere.
- I'm not.

01:24:53.039 --> 01:24:57.442
I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary. 
She's forgotten, of course.

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:59.910
What's the symbol of your first anniversary? 
I should get something.

01:24:59.979 --> 01:25:01.947
<i>Is it cotton or paper?</i>

01:25:02.015 --> 01:25:05.075
Your first anniversary? I thought you two'd 
been married for donkey's years.

01:25:05.151 --> 01:25:08.416
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.

01:25:08.488 --> 01:25:11.423
She was always crying on my shoulder 
about somebody.

01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:15.427
I finally persuaded her to settle for my shoulder. 
A stroke of genius.

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.890
- Moose, are you there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:25:20.967 --> 01:25:24.903
- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?

01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:27.735
First wedding anniversary.

01:25:27.807 --> 01:25:30.503
Your first anniversary is... paper.

01:25:43.489 --> 01:25:46.617
- Stop.
- Please?

01:25:46.693 --> 01:25:48.684
S-- Stop here.

01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:51.025
- Here?
- <i>Just stop right here.</i>

01:25:51.097 --> 01:25:53.224
Yes, sir.

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:31.600
This--
What is this?

01:26:33.072 --> 01:26:35.506
It's a folk song.

01:26:35.575 --> 01:26:38.635
- <i>Arabic.</i>
- No, no, it's Hungarian.

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:43.104
My <i>daijka</i> sang it to me.

01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:46.913
When I was a child growing up in Budapest.

01:26:53.926 --> 01:26:55.917
It's beautiful.

01:26:55.995 --> 01:26:58.156
Hmm.

01:26:58.231 --> 01:27:00.597
What's it about?

01:27:00.666 --> 01:27:02.657
<i>Szerelem</i> means love.

01:27:02.735 --> 01:27:05.966
And the story--
Well, there's, um,

01:27:06.039 --> 01:27:08.599
this Hungarian count.

01:27:08.674 --> 01:27:10.665
He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.

01:27:10.743 --> 01:27:14.941
<i>And for years he's 
on some kind of a quest for...</i>

01:27:15.014 --> 01:27:17.448
who knows what.

01:27:17.517 --> 01:27:23.319
And then one day, he falls under the spell 
of a mysterious English woman,

01:27:23.389 --> 01:27:27.120
a harpy, who beats him and hits him.

01:27:27.193 --> 01:27:30.788
And he becomes her slave
and he sews her clothes and worships--

01:27:30.863 --> 01:27:32.854
Stop!
Stop it!

01:27:32.932 --> 01:27:35.526
Stop! You're always beating me.

01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:37.626
Bastard.

01:27:37.703 --> 01:27:40.001
You bastard!
I believed you!

01:27:40.073 --> 01:27:43.474
You should be my slave.

01:27:49.082 --> 01:27:53.815
I claim this shoulder blade--

01:27:53.886 --> 01:27:57.686
No, wait. No, I want--
Turn over.

01:27:57.757 --> 01:28:01.750
I want this, this-- this place.

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:06.892
I love this place.
What's it called?

01:28:09.602 --> 01:28:12.469
This is mine.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:16.872
I'm going to ask the king permission
to call it the Almasy Bosphorus.

01:28:20.046 --> 01:28:23.174
I thought we were against ownership.

01:28:31.824 --> 01:28:34.224
I can stay tonight.

01:28:40.533 --> 01:28:42.694
Madox knows, I think.

01:28:42.768 --> 01:28:45.430
He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.

01:28:45.505 --> 01:28:49.066
I think it's his idea 
of a man-to-man chat.

01:28:49.142 --> 01:28:51.872
Well, it's my idea
of a man-to-man chat.

01:28:57.550 --> 01:29:00.917
This is a different world,
is what I tell myself.

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:06.524
A different life.

01:29:08.261 --> 01:29:11.788
And here I'm a different wife.

01:29:14.467 --> 01:29:16.992
Yes.

01:29:17.069 --> 01:29:20.561
Here you are a different wife.

01:29:56.943 --> 01:29:59.878
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?

01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:03.040
Yes, and they're quite old.

01:30:03.115 --> 01:30:05.242
It's full of saffron.

01:30:05.318 --> 01:30:09.015
Just in case you think I'm going to 
give it to you to encourage your sewing.

01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:19.163
I don't care to bargain.

01:30:20.633 --> 01:30:23.295
That day, did you follow me
to the market?

01:30:23.369 --> 01:30:25.633
Yes, of course.

01:30:31.744 --> 01:30:34.406
Shall we be all right?

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.414
Yes.

01:30:37.416 --> 01:30:39.350
Yes.

01:30:41.954 --> 01:30:43.945
Absolutely.

01:30:44.023 --> 01:30:45.957
Oh, dear.

01:30:47.293 --> 01:30:50.592
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:30:50.663 --> 01:30:53.598
<i>Oh, I love to go out fishing</i>

01:30:56.569 --> 01:30:59.732
<i>But I don't enjoy it half as much</i>

01:30:59.805 --> 01:31:02.865
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:31:02.942 --> 01:31:05.342
<i>Dance with me</i>

01:31:05.411 --> 01:31:08.244
<i>I want my arms about you</i>

01:31:08.314 --> 01:31:11.374
<i>The charm about you</i>

01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:16.012
<i>Will carry me through to heaven</i>

01:31:16.088 --> 01:31:19.683
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

01:31:19.759 --> 01:31:26.062
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak</i>

01:31:29.035 --> 01:31:32.061
<i>And I seem to find the happiness I seek</i>

01:31:32.104 --> 01:31:37.565
<i>When we're off together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:31:39.445 --> 01:31:42.642
- Thought you'd never wake up.
- What?

01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:46.612
- Where did you find that?
- I liberated it.

01:31:46.686 --> 01:31:51.282
- I think that's called looting.
- No one should own music. The real question is:

01:31:51.357 --> 01:31:52.790
- Who wrote the song?
- Irving Berlin.

01:31:52.858 --> 01:31:54.291
- For?
- <i>Top Hat.</i>

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.590
Is there a song you don't know?

01:31:56.662 --> 01:31:59.961
<i>Nope. He sings all the time.</i>

01:32:00.032 --> 01:32:03.763
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.

01:32:03.836 --> 01:32:06.703
I've been told before.

01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:10.299
Kip's another one.

01:32:14.313 --> 01:32:16.941
"Wang Wang Blues."

01:32:17.016 --> 01:32:18.779
You're incredible.

01:32:27.393 --> 01:32:29.657
- Good mornin', Miss.
- Hello.

01:32:29.729 --> 01:32:32.493
<i>You saved my life.</i>

01:32:32.565 --> 01:32:36.126
I haven't forgotten.

01:32:36.202 --> 01:32:38.966
<i>I thought you were very, very tall.</i>

01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:43.202
You seemed so big and... giant.

01:32:43.275 --> 01:32:45.971
I felt like a child
who can't keep her balance.

01:32:46.045 --> 01:32:49.845
- A toddler.
- A toddler.

01:33:13.606 --> 01:33:16.040
My hair was long at some point.

01:33:19.311 --> 01:33:23.577
I've forgotten what a nuisance 
it is to wash.

01:33:25.885 --> 01:33:29.013
Try this. I found a great jar of it.

01:33:29.088 --> 01:33:31.022
Olive oil.

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:33.024
Thank you.

01:33:41.567 --> 01:33:44.400
Is this for my hair?

01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:47.564
Yes, for your hair.

01:33:55.648 --> 01:33:58.344
There was a general who wore a patch...

01:33:58.417 --> 01:34:01.284
over a perfectly good eye.

01:34:01.353 --> 01:34:04.481
<i>The men fought harder for him.</i>

01:34:10.196 --> 01:34:13.597
Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:16.894
What's under your mittens?

01:34:23.008 --> 01:34:25.033
What's under your mittens?

01:34:47.132 --> 01:34:49.566
He's waiting for you.

01:34:49.635 --> 01:34:51.125
I'll see you tonight?

01:34:54.073 --> 01:34:56.371
Look, Moose, we need you
to stay in Tobruk.

01:34:56.442 --> 01:35:00.469
I know it's a bit of a short straw,
but Jerry's got our maps, you know.

01:35:00.546 --> 01:35:03.413
And now they're getting their spies 
into Cairo using our maps.

01:35:03.482 --> 01:35:06.144
They'll get Rommel into Cairo
using our maps.

01:35:06.218 --> 01:35:09.813
The whole of the desert's like a bloody bus route, 
and we gave it to 'em!

01:35:09.889 --> 01:35:11.823
Any foreigner who turned up:

01:35:11.891 --> 01:35:14.451
"Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps."

01:35:14.527 --> 01:35:16.461
Old Madox went mad, you know.

01:35:16.529 --> 01:35:18.588
- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.

01:35:18.664 --> 01:35:21.258
Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.

01:35:21.333 --> 01:35:23.995
And after he found out
he'd been betrayed by Almasy.

01:35:24.069 --> 01:35:26.333
His best friend.

01:35:26.405 --> 01:35:29.135
Absolutely destroyed the poor sot.

01:35:48.861 --> 01:35:51.125
<i>Hey, Commandant, stay in line!</i>

01:36:09.248 --> 01:36:13.207
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.

01:36:14.587 --> 01:36:16.885
- <i>Recognize him? British friend?</i>
- No.

01:36:17.956 --> 01:36:19.948
Aaah!

01:36:22.394 --> 01:36:25.022
- Get up!
- No!

01:36:25.097 --> 01:36:27.031
<i>Get up at once!</i>

01:36:27.099 --> 01:36:30.034
<i>No, I don't have a boyfriend.</i>

01:36:30.102 --> 01:36:32.662
<i>I don't know anybody!</i>

01:36:32.738 --> 01:36:35.229
Halt!

01:36:35.307 --> 01:36:39.243
<i>No! No!</i>

01:36:48.354 --> 01:36:50.948
<i>David Caravaggio.</i>

01:36:51.023 --> 01:36:54.720
- No.
- <i>This was taken in Cairo at British headquarters.</i>

01:36:54.793 --> 01:36:57.523
July '41.

01:36:57.596 --> 01:36:59.723
And so was this.

01:36:59.798 --> 01:37:03.199
August '41.
And this.

01:37:03.268 --> 01:37:05.236
February '42.

01:37:05.304 --> 01:37:08.068
It's possible.

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:11.439
I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.

01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:15.412
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.

01:37:15.481 --> 01:37:18.575
Code name: Moose.

01:37:28.027 --> 01:37:30.962
Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:34.466
<i>I'm leaking blood!</i>

01:37:34.533 --> 01:37:36.501
You want a doctor?

01:37:36.568 --> 01:37:38.661
I've been askin' for weeks, months--

01:37:38.737 --> 01:37:40.830
We don't have a doctor.

01:37:40.906 --> 01:37:43.272
But we do have a nurse.

01:37:43.342 --> 01:37:45.606
Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.

01:37:47.746 --> 01:37:51.978
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.

01:37:52.051 --> 01:37:54.747
So we can all get out of this room.

01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:58.654
I can't think in this heat.

01:37:58.724 --> 01:38:02.319
- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.

01:38:04.029 --> 01:38:06.657
I've got a wife in Tripoli.

01:38:06.732 --> 01:38:11.226
<i>A girl comes up and points at you, 
you only see trouble.</i>

01:38:11.303 --> 01:38:14.500
<i>Fire!</i>

01:38:16.008 --> 01:38:18.272
<i>I'll tell you what I'm going to do.</i>

01:38:18.343 --> 01:38:21.005
This is your nurse, by the way.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.878
She's Muslim, 
so she'll understand all of this.

01:38:23.949 --> 01:38:27.908
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.

01:38:27.986 --> 01:38:31.444
You're married and you were fucking 
another woman, so that's, uh--

01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:35.892
Is it the hands that are cut off?

01:38:35.961 --> 01:38:38.896
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?

01:38:38.964 --> 01:38:42.161
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?

01:38:42.234 --> 01:38:44.702
- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?

01:38:44.770 --> 01:38:47.705
Ten fingers.

01:38:47.773 --> 01:38:49.707
How about this?

01:38:49.775 --> 01:38:52.505
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.

01:38:52.578 --> 01:38:55.547
<i>I get something, you keep something.</i>

01:38:55.614 --> 01:38:57.912
- <i>I'm trying to be reasonable.</i>
- Don't cut me. Come on!

01:39:02.254 --> 01:39:04.313
Are thumbs fingers?

01:39:12.431 --> 01:39:15.161
- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.

01:39:15.234 --> 01:39:19.330
<i>I'm sick of this room, 
I'm sick of this heat and I'm sick of this phone!</i>

01:39:26.845 --> 01:39:28.710
<i>Ah! The Geneva Convention!</i>

01:39:28.781 --> 01:39:32.114
Hey, come on!
You can't do that!

01:39:32.184 --> 01:39:34.675
- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.

01:39:34.753 --> 01:39:37.916
- <i>You!</i>
- <i>I'll give you names!</i>

01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:40.015
- Come on!
- What names did you say?

01:39:40.092 --> 01:39:44.586
<i>Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!
Just let me think!</i>

01:39:44.663 --> 01:39:47.894
<i>I can't think! I know them!
Please, let me think!</i>

01:39:47.966 --> 01:39:50.230
I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!

01:39:50.302 --> 01:39:53.430
- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!

01:39:53.505 --> 01:39:56.770
- I can't think of any names! Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- <i>What are you waiting for?</i>

01:39:56.842 --> 01:39:59.902
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!

01:39:59.978 --> 01:40:02.538
I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!

01:40:02.614 --> 01:40:06.710
<i>No! Jesus!
Jesus! Oh, dear God!</i>

01:40:06.785 --> 01:40:08.650
- <i>Please don't cut me!</i>
- Come on!

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:11.314
Aaah!
No!

01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:13.551
<i>Please don't cut!</i>

01:40:13.625 --> 01:40:15.528
<i>Don't!</i>

01:40:18.597 --> 01:40:22.192
<i>The man who took my thumbs?</i>

01:40:22.267 --> 01:40:26.260
<i>I found him eventually.
I killed him.</i>

01:40:26.338 --> 01:40:28.932
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.

01:40:29.007 --> 01:40:33.205
That took me a year.
He's dead.

01:40:33.278 --> 01:40:35.542
Another man showed the Germans...

01:40:35.614 --> 01:40:38.412
a way to get their spies into Cairo.

01:40:38.483 --> 01:40:41.748
I've been looking for him.

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.584
<i>You can't get through there.
It's impossible.</i>

01:40:44.656 --> 01:40:47.056
<i>I was looking again 
at Bell's old maps.</i>

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:49.252
<i>If we can find a way through the Wadi,</i>

01:40:49.328 --> 01:40:52.126
<i>we can drive straight into Cairo.</i>

01:40:52.197 --> 01:40:54.995
- This whole spur is a real possibility.
- <i>So on Thursday,</i>

01:40:55.067 --> 01:40:57.763
you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was a fool, 
Bell couldn't draw a map.

01:40:57.836 --> 01:41:00.669
But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.

01:41:00.739 --> 01:41:03.640
- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.

01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:06.143
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.

01:41:06.211 --> 01:41:09.044
They shouldn't be left lying around for 
any Tom, Dick or Harry to have sight of.

01:41:09.114 --> 01:41:11.708
What on earth's the matter with you?

01:41:11.783 --> 01:41:15.014
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!

01:41:22.127 --> 01:41:24.322
This arrived this morning.

01:41:24.396 --> 01:41:26.660
"By order of the British Government,

01:41:26.732 --> 01:41:31.101
all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1939."

01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:38.031
What do they care about our maps?

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.578
What do we find in the desert?

01:41:40.646 --> 01:41:43.240
Arrowheads, spears.

01:41:43.315 --> 01:41:46.250
In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.

01:41:46.318 --> 01:41:48.980
Own the desert?
Ha!

01:41:50.055 --> 01:41:53.752
Um, Madox?
That place--

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:59.357
That place at the base of a woman's throat.

01:42:00.966 --> 01:42:04.493
<i>You know, the hollow here.</i>

01:42:04.569 --> 01:42:06.867
Does it have an official name?

01:42:08.941 --> 01:42:12.672
For God's sake, man,
pull yourself together.

01:42:23.188 --> 01:42:26.123
<i>Nowhere is there any 
wild patriotic excitement,</i>

01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:28.250
<i>but everywhere there is
a deep hatred of war.</i>

01:42:28.327 --> 01:42:30.989
<i>The answer lies with one man,</i>

01:42:31.063 --> 01:42:34.624
<i>and the solid mass of the crowd
surging round his car...</i>

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:38.397
<i>are a symbol that the British people 
are more firmly of one mind today...</i>

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.701
<i>than at any other time
in our history.</i>

01:42:46.845 --> 01:42:49.905
<i>There's a great to-do in Sandown Bay,</i>

01:42:49.982 --> 01:42:53.816
<i>with rowing and sailing, 
and no end of sport for every water baby.</i>

01:42:56.655 --> 01:42:59.419
Sorry.

01:43:02.327 --> 01:43:05.057
I can't--
I can't do this.

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:11.869
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.

01:43:40.499 --> 01:43:42.763
I'd better go now.

01:43:45.203 --> 01:43:47.637
Say goodbye here.

01:43:47.706 --> 01:43:51.403
I'm not agreeing. 
Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

01:43:51.476 --> 01:43:53.501
Any minute now, he'll find out.

01:43:53.578 --> 01:43:55.569
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.

01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:57.740
Don't go over it again, please.

01:44:08.627 --> 01:44:11.323
Katharine?

01:44:15.267 --> 01:44:17.497
I--

01:44:17.569 --> 01:44:20.663
I just want you to know I'm--

01:44:20.739 --> 01:44:23.401
I'm not missing you yet.

01:44:25.744 --> 01:44:29.646
You will.
You will.

01:45:02.513 --> 01:45:04.949
I believe I'm rather late.

01:45:06.318 --> 01:45:08.843
Good.
We're all here.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.050
<i>A toast to the International Sand Club.</i>

01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:15.525
May it soon resurface.

01:45:15.594 --> 01:45:17.494
The International Sand Club.

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:22.590
The International Sand Club:
misfits, buggers, fascists and fools.

01:45:22.667 --> 01:45:25.261
God bless us, every one.
Oops!

01:45:25.337 --> 01:45:28.932
Mustn't say "International".
Dirty word, filthy word.

01:45:29.007 --> 01:45:32.272
<i>His Majesty, die Fuhrer, il Duce--</i>

01:45:32.344 --> 01:45:33.811
Sorry.
What's your point?

01:45:33.879 --> 01:45:36.905
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.

01:45:36.982 --> 01:45:40.941
Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the colonials. 
Isn't that right, Fouad?

01:45:41.019 --> 01:45:44.318
<i>Some of their best people 
getting down on their hands and knees,</i>

01:45:44.389 --> 01:45:46.880
begging to be spared the Knighthood.

01:45:46.958 --> 01:45:50.416
Isn't that right? Hmm?
Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?

01:45:50.495 --> 01:45:54.329
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.

01:45:54.399 --> 01:45:56.492
<i>Anybody up for it?
It's called--</i>

01:45:56.568 --> 01:45:59.128
It's called the Bosphorus Hug.

01:45:59.204 --> 01:46:00.899
Madox?

01:46:00.972 --> 01:46:05.432
<i>Bermann?
You'll dance with me? Hmm?</i>

01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:08.445
D'Ag.
Come on, Daggers.

01:46:08.513 --> 01:46:11.004
<i>Let's eat first.
Sit down.</i>

01:46:13.852 --> 01:46:17.253
<i>We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten</i>

01:46:17.322 --> 01:46:20.086
<i>When you're in your bathing suit so thin</i>

01:46:20.158 --> 01:46:22.752
<i>We'll make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin</i>

01:46:22.827 --> 01:46:25.819
<i>They're playing it far too slowly,
but these were the words,</i>

01:46:25.897 --> 01:46:29.663
actually, before they were cleaned up.

01:46:29.734 --> 01:46:32.828
Might be a song for you, Mrs. Clif--

01:46:32.904 --> 01:46:35.338
<i>You either shut up or go home! 
You're completely blasted!</i>

01:46:35.407 --> 01:46:38.205
- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!

01:46:38.276 --> 01:46:42.713
<i>Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.</i>

01:46:42.781 --> 01:46:45.477
I can't think what came over me.

01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:48.542
Lashings of apologies...

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:50.815
all around.

01:47:23.388 --> 01:47:24.855
Thank you.

01:47:34.899 --> 01:47:38.164
- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?

01:47:38.236 --> 01:47:41.672
"What"? That boy.
That little boy.

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:44.903
You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?

01:47:44.976 --> 01:47:47.444
Hmm?
Is he next?

01:47:47.512 --> 01:47:50.174
Are you going to drag him
into your little room? Where is it?

01:47:50.248 --> 01:47:52.148
Is this it?

01:47:52.217 --> 01:47:54.481
- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.

01:47:54.552 --> 01:47:56.918
I've watched you at garden parties,

01:47:56.988 --> 01:47:59.252
on verandas, at the races.

01:47:59.324 --> 01:48:03.283
- How can you... stand there?
- Please.

01:48:03.361 --> 01:48:06.228
How can you ever smile,

01:48:06.298 --> 01:48:10.325
as if your life hadn't capsized?

01:48:12.003 --> 01:48:14.471
You know why?

01:48:17.075 --> 01:48:19.066
Dance with me.

01:48:20.145 --> 01:48:22.545
No.

01:48:22.614 --> 01:48:25.583
Dance with me.

01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:28.585
I want to touch you.

01:48:28.653 --> 01:48:32.589
I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.452
Do you think you're the only one 
who feels anything?

01:48:39.531 --> 01:48:42.500
Is that what you think?

01:49:01.319 --> 01:49:04.345
Why don't you go?

01:49:04.422 --> 01:49:08.085
- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?

01:49:14.966 --> 01:49:17.799
Good night.

01:50:22.367 --> 01:50:24.301
<i>Hana.</i>

01:50:29.374 --> 01:50:31.672
Kip.

01:51:05.555 --> 01:51:08.786
Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.

01:51:31.514 --> 01:51:33.573
Wait.

01:51:49.899 --> 01:51:51.992
Kip!

01:53:12.715 --> 01:53:15.047
Oh, thank you!

01:53:16.052 --> 01:53:18.179
Mmm!

01:53:31.834 --> 01:53:35.793
If one night I didn't come to see you,

01:53:37.306 --> 01:53:39.866
what would you do?

01:53:39.942 --> 01:53:42.775
I try not to expect you.

01:53:45.648 --> 01:53:49.709
Yes, but if it got late and...

01:53:49.785 --> 01:53:52.413
I hadn't shown up?

01:53:53.856 --> 01:53:57.223
Then I'd think there must be a reason.

01:53:58.294 --> 01:54:00.728
You wouldn't come to find me?

01:54:03.065 --> 01:54:06.626
Hmm. That makes me never want to come here.

01:54:11.507 --> 01:54:13.771
Then I'd tell myself,

01:54:13.843 --> 01:54:17.108
he spends all day searching.

01:54:17.179 --> 01:54:20.114
In the night, he wants to be found.

01:54:25.521 --> 01:54:28.456
I do. I do want you to find me.

01:54:29.525 --> 01:54:31.959
<i>I do want to be found.</i>

01:54:49.478 --> 01:54:52.072
I was looking for Lieutenant Singh.

01:54:52.148 --> 01:54:56.209
- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.

01:54:56.285 --> 01:54:58.753
I'll tell him.

01:54:59.955 --> 01:55:02.549
What is it?
Is it a mine?

01:55:02.625 --> 01:55:05.355
It's a bomb by a viaduct.

01:55:06.662 --> 01:55:09.324
- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?

01:55:09.398 --> 01:55:13.334
What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.

01:55:13.402 --> 01:55:17.338
- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.

01:55:19.407 --> 01:55:21.501
<i>Don't go.
I'm frightened.</i>

01:55:21.577 --> 01:55:24.546
This is what I do.

01:55:24.613 --> 01:55:27.605
I do this every day.

01:55:46.602 --> 01:55:48.593
Hardy!

01:55:48.671 --> 01:55:51.834
Serial number K-K-I-P...

01:55:51.907 --> 01:55:54.705
2-6-0-0.

01:55:54.777 --> 01:55:57.769
<i>K-K-I-P2600, sir!</i>

01:55:57.847 --> 01:56:00.338
I'll get the oxygen.

01:56:56.672 --> 01:56:59.664
<i>Hardy, what's happening?</i>

01:56:59.742 --> 01:57:02.711
<i>Can't see, sir!
It's from the road!</i>

01:57:04.246 --> 01:57:07.545
Corporal?

01:57:07.616 --> 01:57:11.017
Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!

01:57:11.086 --> 01:57:14.021
- Stop 'em!
- Stop!

01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:16.455
Stop!

01:57:16.525 --> 01:57:19.926
- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!

01:57:19.995 --> 01:57:22.088
What is this, a bloody carnival?

01:57:22.164 --> 01:57:24.189
The fuse has snapped!

01:57:24.266 --> 01:57:28.100
<i>What's happened? Is it armed?</i>

01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:31.537
Hang on a second.

01:57:31.607 --> 01:57:33.472
<i>I'll be right with you.</i>

01:57:33.542 --> 01:57:36.909
<i>Can you see the detonator, sir?</i>

01:57:36.979 --> 01:57:39.812
You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.

01:57:41.183 --> 01:57:44.152
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

01:57:48.357 --> 01:57:51.758
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

01:57:51.827 --> 01:57:54.591
- Go away!
- Yes, sir.

01:57:54.663 --> 01:57:58.429
- This is making me incredibly angry.
- I know, sir.

01:57:59.501 --> 01:58:01.560
<i>Watch out!
That'll burn!</i>

01:58:01.637 --> 01:58:03.468
Ow!

01:58:08.377 --> 01:58:10.777
<i>Can you feel 'em?</i>

01:58:20.723 --> 01:58:23.191
Cut it, sir.

01:58:23.259 --> 01:58:25.750
- <i>You've gotta cut it!</i>
- I don't even know if this is the right wire.

01:58:25.828 --> 01:58:29.423
<i>Choose. Just choose a loop 
and cut it.</i>

01:58:51.687 --> 01:58:55.214
Get a blanket! Spaulding, 
get a blanket for Lieutenant!

01:58:55.291 --> 01:58:58.818
Sarge! Sarge!
It's over, sir! It's over!

01:58:58.894 --> 01:59:01.886
- Jerry's surrendered!
- Yeah-ha!

01:59:06.902 --> 01:59:08.836
Sir, congratulations.

01:59:10.673 --> 01:59:15.804
<i>Heaven
I'm in heaven</i>

01:59:15.878 --> 01:59:18.608
Kip? Kip?

01:59:18.681 --> 01:59:20.615
Kip!

01:59:20.683 --> 01:59:24.483
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak</i>

01:59:24.553 --> 01:59:29.684
<i>And I seem to find
the happiness I seek</i>

01:59:29.758 --> 01:59:32.056
Hey, we're goin' home!

01:59:32.127 --> 01:59:37.121
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:59:39.466 --> 01:59:41.698
It's raining.

01:59:46.008 --> 01:59:49.774
<i>And the cares that hung around me 
through the week</i>

01:59:52.548 --> 02:00:00.250
<i>Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak</i>

02:00:00.322 --> 02:00:04.554
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

02:00:07.363 --> 02:00:10.855
<i>Oh, I love to climb a mountain</i>

02:00:10.933 --> 02:00:14.369
<i>And to reach the highest peak</i>

02:00:14.436 --> 02:00:18.202
<i>But it doesn't thrill me half as much</i>

02:00:18.273 --> 02:00:21.765
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

02:00:25.681 --> 02:00:28.149
Kip, come and dance with us.

02:00:28.217 --> 02:00:30.447
- Later.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

02:00:33.288 --> 02:00:37.122
Clap now.

02:00:37.192 --> 02:00:39.387
Yeah.

02:00:55.577 --> 02:00:58.637
<i>Come on, Sarge!
Let's raise that flag!</i>

02:00:58.714 --> 02:01:01.080
Hardy's coming!

02:01:02.217 --> 02:01:04.651
Here comes the bomb squad!

02:01:11.226 --> 02:01:13.353
Hey, where's my helmet?

02:01:13.429 --> 02:01:16.489
Go on,
Sergeant Hardy!

02:01:25.207 --> 02:01:28.005
Bring 'em home!

02:01:28.076 --> 02:01:30.806
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!

02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:39.819
What was that?

02:01:42.791 --> 02:01:45.225
<i>I'm never going to forgive myself.</i>

02:01:45.294 --> 02:01:47.819
<i>I'm never going to bloody forgive myself.</i>

02:01:51.166 --> 02:01:54.397
Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.

02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:58.201
They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir,
up on that statue.

02:01:58.273 --> 02:02:01.504
It just went off, sir.

02:02:01.577 --> 02:02:04.978
Sergeant Hardy climbed up, Sir, 
just for a lark, sir.

02:02:05.047 --> 02:02:07.106
It should've been me.
It was my idea.

02:02:07.182 --> 02:02:10.413
- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.

02:02:10.486 --> 02:02:12.511
Who's that girl?

02:02:12.588 --> 02:02:15.386
His fiancee, sir.

02:02:15.457 --> 02:02:19.655
- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.

02:02:27.769 --> 02:02:29.703
Kip?

02:02:30.772 --> 02:02:33.070
Kip, it's me.

02:02:34.276 --> 02:02:37.211
<i>I'm so sorry about what happened.</i>

02:02:38.547 --> 02:02:41.675
<i>Can I talk to you?
Kip?</i>

02:02:43.452 --> 02:02:46.387
Kip, why won't you talk to me?

02:02:49.591 --> 02:02:51.855
Oh, Kip.

02:02:55.864 --> 02:02:58.298
Oh, let me come in!

02:03:24.626 --> 02:03:27.959
<i>Hana tells me you're leaving.</i>

02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:30.464
<i>There's going to be trials.</i>

02:03:30.532 --> 02:03:32.796
<i>They want me to interpret.</i>

02:03:32.868 --> 02:03:35.735
<i>Don't they know 
I'm allergic to courtrooms?</i>

02:03:40.242 --> 02:03:42.176
So...

02:03:43.979 --> 02:03:46.243
I come across the hospital convoy.

02:03:46.315 --> 02:03:49.307
<i>They're looking for this stuff.</i>

02:03:49.384 --> 02:03:51.750
<i>This nurse, Mary,</i>

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.254
<i>tells me about you and Hana...</i>

02:03:54.323 --> 02:03:56.757
<i>hiding in some monastery in--</i>

02:03:56.825 --> 02:04:00.056
What do you call it?
Retreat?

02:04:00.128 --> 02:04:02.528
How you came out of the desert...

02:04:02.598 --> 02:04:06.864
and you were burned
and you didn't remember your name,

02:04:06.935 --> 02:04:09.529
but you knew the words
to every song that ever was...

02:04:09.605 --> 02:04:13.507
and you had one possession:
a copy of Herodotus.

02:04:13.575 --> 02:04:16.135
And it was filled...

02:04:16.211 --> 02:04:18.475
with letters and cuttings.

02:04:19.681 --> 02:04:22.115
Then I knew it was you.

02:04:24.753 --> 02:04:27.347
Me?

02:04:37.866 --> 02:04:39.800
I saw you...

02:04:39.868 --> 02:04:44.828
<i>writing in that book
at the embassy in Cairo...</i>

02:04:46.441 --> 02:04:50.400
when I had thumbs and you had a face...

02:04:50.479 --> 02:04:52.470
and a name.

02:04:52.547 --> 02:04:54.481
<i>I see.</i>

02:04:55.884 --> 02:04:58.182
Before you went over to the Germans,

02:04:58.253 --> 02:05:02.986
<i>before you found a way to get Rommel's spy 
across the desert and inside British headquarters.</i>

02:05:03.058 --> 02:05:05.356
He took some pretty good photographs.

02:05:05.427 --> 02:05:08.828
I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk.

02:05:08.897 --> 02:05:13.231
So, it made an impression.

02:05:13.301 --> 02:05:17.738
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.

02:05:17.806 --> 02:05:19.899
The rest meant nothing to me.

02:05:19.975 --> 02:05:22.466
What did you say?

02:05:22.544 --> 02:05:26.036
That the rest... meant nothing to me.

02:05:26.114 --> 02:05:28.674
There was a result to what you did.

02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:32.277
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.

02:05:32.354 --> 02:05:35.323
<i>If the British hadn't 
unearthed that photographer,</i>

02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:37.483
<i>thousands of people could have died.</i>

02:05:37.559 --> 02:05:41.120
Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.

02:05:41.196 --> 02:05:45.360
- Yes, like Madox.
- What?

02:05:45.434 --> 02:05:48.232
You know he shot himself,
your partner,

02:05:48.303 --> 02:05:50.897
- <i>when he found out you were a spy.</i>
- What?

02:05:53.175 --> 02:05:57.771
Madox thought I was a spy? No.

02:05:57.846 --> 02:06:01.043
<i>No, I was never a spy.</i>

02:06:01.116 --> 02:06:03.676
It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.

02:06:03.752 --> 02:06:06.186
Anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy.

02:06:06.254 --> 02:06:08.745
- So watch out.
- Right.

02:06:08.824 --> 02:06:12.157
We didn't care about countries, did we?

02:06:12.227 --> 02:06:15.060
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans--

02:06:15.130 --> 02:06:17.394
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.

02:06:17.466 --> 02:06:20.333
Yes, it was.

02:06:21.803 --> 02:06:24.897
I'll leave the plane in Kufra oasis.

02:06:24.973 --> 02:06:27.441
- <i>So, if you need it--</i>
- Right.

02:06:27.509 --> 02:06:30.205
<i>Hard to know how long 
one's talking about.</i>

02:06:30.278 --> 02:06:34.009
We might all be back in a month or two.

02:06:37.319 --> 02:06:39.287
Hmm.

02:06:42.991 --> 02:06:47.587
I have to teach myself 
not to read too much into everything.

02:06:47.662 --> 02:06:51.189
It comes of too long having to read so much 
into hardly anything at all.

02:06:56.738 --> 02:06:59.969
Good-bye, my friend.

02:07:05.447 --> 02:07:07.506
There is no God.

02:07:07.582 --> 02:07:10.881
But I hope someone looks after you.

02:07:12.721 --> 02:07:16.179
In case you're still wondering,

02:07:16.258 --> 02:07:19.284
this is called a suprasternal notch.

02:07:23.198 --> 02:07:26.690
Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.

02:07:32.641 --> 02:07:34.836
You'll never come to Dorset.

02:07:44.452 --> 02:07:48.218
<i>So, you didn't know Madox shot himself.</i>

02:07:51.393 --> 02:07:53.327
No.

02:07:53.395 --> 02:07:56.091
And you didn't kill the Cliftons?

02:08:04.039 --> 02:08:06.007
Sh--

02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:14.214
She--

02:08:17.352 --> 02:08:20.219
She die--

02:08:20.288 --> 02:08:22.279
She--
I can't.

02:08:26.294 --> 02:08:28.228
Well...

02:08:29.431 --> 02:08:32.025
maybe I did.

02:08:36.137 --> 02:08:38.901
Maybe I did.

02:08:45.347 --> 02:08:48.145
<i>I was packing up our base camp...</i>

02:08:48.216 --> 02:08:50.946
<i>at the Cave of Swimmers.</i>

02:08:51.019 --> 02:08:55.683
<i>Clifton had offered to fly down
from Cairo to collect me.</i>

02:08:55.757 --> 02:08:58.783
<i>He flew like a madman always,</i>

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:01.420
<i>so I-- I took no notice.</i>

02:09:10.038 --> 02:09:11.096
Aaah!

02:09:35.964 --> 02:09:39.991
Katharine?

02:09:40.068 --> 02:09:43.902
Dear God, Katharine,
what are you doing here?

02:09:43.972 --> 02:09:47.408
I can't get out.
I can't move.

02:09:50.946 --> 02:09:53.414
"Surprise", he said.

02:09:54.816 --> 02:09:57.478
Poor Geoffrey.

02:09:57.552 --> 02:10:02.285
He knew. 
He must've known all the time.

02:10:02.357 --> 02:10:05.793
He was shouting, "I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much."

02:10:08.263 --> 02:10:10.697
Is he badly hurt?

02:10:12.334 --> 02:10:14.461
I have to get you out.

02:10:14.536 --> 02:10:16.970
- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.

02:10:17.038 --> 02:10:20.804
- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.

02:10:20.875 --> 02:10:22.809
Come on.

02:10:24.079 --> 02:10:26.411
Now!

02:10:44.566 --> 02:10:46.898
Why did you hate me?

02:10:46.968 --> 02:10:48.902
What?

02:10:51.406 --> 02:10:54.034
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:57.601
Shh.
Don't talk.

02:10:57.679 --> 02:10:59.977
You speak so many bloody languages...

02:11:00.048 --> 02:11:02.482
and you never want to talk.

02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:11.889
- <i>You're wearing the thimble.</i>
- Of course.

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.520
You idiot.

02:11:14.596 --> 02:11:18.259
I always wear it.
I've always worn it.

02:11:18.333 --> 02:11:20.767
I've always loved you.

02:11:56.504 --> 02:11:58.495
It's so cold.

02:11:58.573 --> 02:12:01.098
I know.
I'm sorry.

02:12:03.378 --> 02:12:05.812
I'll make a fire.

02:12:10.018 --> 02:12:12.885
<i>Did you get Geoffrey out of the plane?</i>

02:12:12.954 --> 02:12:15.855
- Yes, I did.
- <i>Good. That's good. Thank you.</i>

02:12:20.695 --> 02:12:22.959
Listen to me, Katharine.

02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:25.522
You've broken your ankle...

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.125
and I'm going to have to try and bind it.

02:12:28.203 --> 02:12:30.763
I think you've also broken your wrist...

02:12:30.839 --> 02:12:34.434
and maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.

02:12:34.509 --> 02:12:37.103
<i>I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.</i>

02:12:37.178 --> 02:12:41.012
Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,

02:12:41.082 --> 02:12:44.711
I'm bound to bump 
into one army or another.

02:12:44.786 --> 02:12:48.222
<i>And then I'll come back
and you'll be fine.</i>

02:12:48.289 --> 02:12:50.348
You promise?

02:12:50.425 --> 02:12:53.519
<i>I wouldn't want to die here.</i>

02:12:54.696 --> 02:12:57.164
I don't want to die in the desert.

02:13:00.902 --> 02:13:03.837
I've always had a rather 
elaborate funeral in mind.

02:13:05.807 --> 02:13:08.173
<i>Particular hymns.</i>

02:13:08.243 --> 02:13:11.178
And I know exactly
where I want to be buried.

02:13:12.647 --> 02:13:16.344
In our garden, where I grew up...

02:13:16.417 --> 02:13:19.477
with a view of the sea.

02:13:19.554 --> 02:13:22.352
So promise me you'll come back for me.

02:13:22.423 --> 02:13:25.051
I promise...

02:13:25.126 --> 02:13:27.390
I'll come back for you.

02:13:28.796 --> 02:13:31.663
I promise...

02:13:31.733 --> 02:13:35.032
I'll never leave you.

02:13:38.606 --> 02:13:41.097
You have plenty of water...

02:13:41.176 --> 02:13:43.337
and, um, food.

02:13:43.411 --> 02:13:47.006
I'll open them for you.

02:13:51.819 --> 02:13:53.844
A good read.

02:13:57.525 --> 02:13:59.550
Don't waste this.

02:14:03.198 --> 02:14:05.632
Will you bury Geoffrey?

02:14:10.471 --> 02:14:12.598
I know he's dead.

02:14:15.176 --> 02:14:17.440
I'm sorry, Katharine.

02:14:19.447 --> 02:14:21.381
I know.

02:14:28.556 --> 02:14:31.821
Every night...

02:14:31.893 --> 02:14:34.259
I cut out my heart.

02:14:38.766 --> 02:14:41.064
But in the morning it was full again.

02:14:48.743 --> 02:14:50.677
Darling.

02:14:52.313 --> 02:14:54.304
My darling.

02:15:21.376 --> 02:15:24.607
<i>You'd better be ready
about half past 8:00</i>

02:15:24.679 --> 02:15:26.943
<i>Now, honey
Don't you be late</i>

02:15:27.015 --> 02:15:29.916
<i>I'm going to be there
when the band starts playing</i>

02:15:29.984 --> 02:15:32.077
<i>Remember
When we get there, honey</i>

02:15:32.153 --> 02:15:34.781
<i>An invitation to the strutter's ball</i>

02:15:34.856 --> 02:15:36.983
<i>A very swell affair</i>

02:15:37.058 --> 02:15:39.492
<i>All the highbrows will be there</i>

02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.223
<i>I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey</i>

02:15:43.298 --> 02:15:47.462
<i>I stopped at noon and at twilight.</i>

02:15:47.535 --> 02:15:51.995
<i>Three days there on foot,
I told her,</i>

02:15:52.073 --> 02:15:56.009
<i>and three hours back by car.</i>

02:15:58.079 --> 02:16:00.707
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

02:16:01.716 --> 02:16:03.650
<i>I'll be back.</i>

02:16:06.621 --> 02:16:08.885
<i>I'll be back.</i>

02:16:25.707 --> 02:16:28.005
Just walked in from the desert, sir.

02:16:29.243 --> 02:16:31.643
<i>Morning.</i>

02:16:44.392 --> 02:16:47.451
Dear golly, 
where have you come from then?

02:16:48.529 --> 02:16:50.895
There's been an accident.

02:16:50.965 --> 02:16:53.525
I need a doctor...

02:16:53.601 --> 02:16:56.933
to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.

02:16:57.004 --> 02:16:58.938
I'll pay, of course.

02:16:59.005 --> 02:17:02.907
- And I need-- I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?

02:17:02.977 --> 02:17:05.172
What?

02:17:05.245 --> 02:17:08.579
If I could just see
some form of identification.

02:17:08.648 --> 02:17:12.141
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I-- I'm not--

02:17:12.219 --> 02:17:14.710
I've been walking and--

02:17:14.789 --> 02:17:19.657
A woman is badly injured at the Gilf Kabir, 
the Cave of Swimmers.

02:17:19.727 --> 02:17:22.423
<i>I'm a member of the 
Royal Geographical Society.</i>

02:17:22.496 --> 02:17:25.159
Right.

02:17:25.233 --> 02:17:28.669
Now, if I could... 
just take your name.

02:17:31.672 --> 02:17:36.335
Count Laszlo de Almasy.

02:17:38.579 --> 02:17:42.639
"Almasy." 
Would you mind spelling that for me?

02:17:42.717 --> 02:17:45.914
- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?

02:17:45.986 --> 02:17:50.184
A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.

02:17:50.258 --> 02:17:54.456
I have been... walking--

02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:58.424
<i>I have been walking for three days.</i>

02:17:58.499 --> 02:18:00.967
I do not want to spell my name.

02:18:01.035 --> 02:18:04.266
- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.

02:18:04.338 --> 02:18:07.501
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.

02:18:07.575 --> 02:18:12.535
No. No, don't--
Don't radio anybody!

02:18:12.612 --> 02:18:15.843
Just give me the fucking car!

02:19:15.809 --> 02:19:20.008
Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!

02:19:20.081 --> 02:19:22.606
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
to another word from you,

02:19:22.683 --> 02:19:24.708
I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!

02:19:24.785 --> 02:19:27.379
Fritz? 
What are you talking about, Fritz?

02:19:27.455 --> 02:19:28.888
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

02:19:28.956 --> 02:19:30.947
Count Fuckin' Asshole Von Bismarck!

02:19:31.025 --> 02:19:33.754
- What's that supposed to be, Irish?
- Please!

02:19:33.827 --> 02:19:37.763
You have to listen!
Katharine!

02:19:37.832 --> 02:19:40.562
<i>Katharine!</i>

02:19:52.313 --> 02:19:54.611
Excuse me.

02:19:54.682 --> 02:19:58.618
- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.

02:19:58.686 --> 02:20:02.486
- It's urgent.
- Sarge!

02:20:02.557 --> 02:20:05.720
Sarge, Jerry wants to use the lav.

02:20:05.793 --> 02:20:08.125
Says it's urgent.

02:20:10.197 --> 02:20:13.633
- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.

02:20:13.701 --> 02:20:16.169
Benghazi.
Soon be there.

02:20:16.237 --> 02:20:18.262
<i>You can get your boat back home then.</i>

02:20:18.339 --> 02:20:22.799
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.

02:20:22.877 --> 02:20:26.278
I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.

02:20:41.495 --> 02:20:43.588
It doesn't open.

02:20:57.178 --> 02:21:00.545
Aaah!

02:21:53.534 --> 02:21:55.661
<i>So yes,</i>

02:21:57.171 --> 02:22:00.265
she died because of me.

02:22:03.077 --> 02:22:05.341
Because I loved her.

02:22:08.949 --> 02:22:11.213
Because I--

02:22:14.321 --> 02:22:16.915
Because I had the wrong name.

02:22:26.867 --> 02:22:31.201
- And you never got back to the cave?
- <i>I did get back.</i>

02:22:31.272 --> 02:22:34.139
I kept my promise.

02:22:35.342 --> 02:22:38.641
<i>I was assisted by the Germans.</i>

02:22:38.713 --> 02:22:41.079
<i>There was a-- a trade.</i>

02:22:41.148 --> 02:22:44.549
<i>I had our expedition maps.</i>

02:22:44.618 --> 02:22:47.712
<i>And after the British made me their enemy,</i>

02:22:47.788 --> 02:22:51.690
<i>I gave their enemy our maps.</i>

02:23:04.105 --> 02:23:06.733
<i>So I got back to the desert...</i>

02:23:06.807 --> 02:23:09.275
<i>and to Katharine...</i>

02:23:09.343 --> 02:23:11.641
<i>in Madox's English plane...</i>

02:23:11.712 --> 02:23:14.112
<i>with German gasoline.</i>

02:23:18.619 --> 02:23:21.281
When I arrived in Italy,

02:23:21.355 --> 02:23:24.051
on my medical chart they wrote,

02:23:24.125 --> 02:23:26.923
"English Patient."

02:23:26.994 --> 02:23:29.690
Isn't that funny?

02:23:29.764 --> 02:23:33.165
After all that, I became English.

02:23:36.637 --> 02:23:40.664
You get to the morning 
and the poison leaks away, doesn't it?

02:23:44.245 --> 02:23:46.509
Black nights.

02:23:50.584 --> 02:23:53.849
- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.

02:23:55.222 --> 02:23:57.486
I died years ago.

02:24:01.462 --> 02:24:04.124
No, I can't kill you now.

02:24:23.284 --> 02:24:26.412

North of Florence.

02:24:32.393 --> 02:24:36.329
I was thinking yesterday--

02:24:36.397 --> 02:24:38.922
yesterday--

02:24:38.999 --> 02:24:41.467
The patient and Hardy.

02:24:41.535 --> 02:24:43.867
They're everything
that's good about England.

02:24:45.039 --> 02:24:47.507
I couldn't even say what that was.

02:24:49.410 --> 02:24:53.506
We didn't exchange two personal words,

02:24:53.581 --> 02:24:56.243
and we've been together
through some terrible things.

02:24:56.317 --> 02:24:58.683
<i>Some terrible things.</i>

02:24:58.752 --> 02:25:02.882
He was engaged to a girl in the village.

02:25:02.957 --> 02:25:05.551
I mean--

02:25:05.626 --> 02:25:09.790
And us, he never once--

02:25:09.864 --> 02:25:15.268
He didn't ask me if I could spin
the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or--

02:25:28.616 --> 02:25:31.244
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

02:25:31.318 --> 02:25:34.253
You loved him.

02:26:58.005 --> 02:26:59.973
Katharine.

02:27:13.487 --> 02:27:16.115
I'm still here.

02:27:17.558 --> 02:27:20.186
You'd better be.

02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:23.058
Don't depend on it, will you?

02:27:24.365 --> 02:27:27.732
That little bit of air in my lungs,

02:27:27.801 --> 02:27:31.498
each day it gets less and less.

02:27:32.973 --> 02:27:35.305
Which is all right.

02:27:35.376 --> 02:27:37.810
It's quite all right.

02:27:39.913 --> 02:27:43.280
I've been speaking to Caravaggio,

02:27:43.350 --> 02:27:46.285
my research assistant.

02:27:46.353 --> 02:27:49.880
He tells me there's a ghost in the cloisters.

02:27:51.258 --> 02:27:53.783
I can join him.

02:27:55.929 --> 02:27:58.659
- <i>Hana!</i>
- It's the boy.

02:28:22.890 --> 02:28:25.324
I'll always go back to that church.

02:28:26.326 --> 02:28:28.954
Look at my paintings.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.400
I'll always go back to that church.

02:28:37.438 --> 02:28:40.771
So one day we'll meet.

02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:32.384
Thank you.

02:30:44.264 --> 02:30:46.528
Read to me, will you?

02:30:52.406 --> 02:30:54.840
<i>Read me to sleep.</i>

02:31:17.864 --> 02:31:20.526
<i>"My darling,</i>

02:31:20.601 --> 02:31:23.365
<i>"I'm waiting for you.</i>

02:31:23.437 --> 02:31:26.736
<i>"How long is a day in the dark?</i>

02:31:26.807 --> 02:31:29.071
"Or a week?

02:31:37.517 --> 02:31:39.917
"The fire is gone now...

02:31:39.987 --> 02:31:42.979
and I'm horr-- horribly cold."

02:31:44.858 --> 02:31:47.622
<i>I really ought to drag myself outside,</i>

02:31:47.694 --> 02:31:50.356
<i>but then there'd be the sun.</i>

02:31:50.430 --> 02:31:52.694
<i>I'm afraid I waste the light...</i>

02:31:52.766 --> 02:31:56.031
<i>on the paintings
and on writing these words.</i>

02:31:59.306 --> 02:32:01.206
<i>We die.</i>

02:32:01.275 --> 02:32:03.436
"We die.

02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:07.310
"We die rich with lovers and tribes,

02:32:07.381 --> 02:32:10.646
"tastes we have swallowed,

02:32:10.717 --> 02:32:13.584
"bodies we have entered...

02:32:13.654 --> 02:32:15.884
and swum up like rivers."

02:32:15.956 --> 02:32:19.323
<i>Fears we've hidden in,</i>

02:32:19.393 --> 02:32:21.657
<i>like this wretched cave.</i>

02:32:27.634 --> 02:32:30.228
<i>I want all this marked on my body.</i>

02:32:32.572 --> 02:32:35.541
<i>We're the real countries.</i>

02:32:35.609 --> 02:32:38.134
<i>Not the boundaries drawn on maps,</i>

02:32:38.211 --> 02:32:40.805
<i>the names of powerful men.</i>

02:32:51.658 --> 02:32:55.594
<i>I know you'll come and carry me out 
into the palace of winds.</i>

02:33:03.503 --> 02:33:06.472
<i>That's all I've wanted,</i>

02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:10.476
<i>to walk in such a place with you,</i>

02:33:10.544 --> 02:33:13.445
<i>with friends.</i>

02:33:13.513 --> 02:33:15.947
<i>An Earth without maps.</i>

02:33:21.321 --> 02:33:24.085
"The lamp's gone out,

02:33:24.157 --> 02:33:27.593
"and I'm writing...

02:33:27.661 --> 02:33:29.925
in the darkness."

02:34:32.692 --> 02:34:35.354
<i>Hana?</i>

02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:37.863
<i>Hana, come on!</i>

02:34:39.599 --> 02:34:41.931
<i>Hana...</i>

02:34:43.537 --> 02:34:45.471
this is Gioia.

02:34:45.539 --> 02:34:48.508
- <i>Buon giorno.</i>
- <i>Buon giorno.</i>

02:34:48.575 --> 02:34:50.566
She'll take you as far as Florence.

02:34:50.644 --> 02:34:52.908
I can get in back.
