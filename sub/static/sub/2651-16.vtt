WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:06.434
Okay, here's the number
for poison control. Ask for Carol.

00:06.520 --> 00:09.160
Honey, we're gonna be fine.
Enjoy your reunion.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.118
It would be a lot more fun
if you were there.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.677
I really am sorry about that. I just can't
miss the chance to bowl on Jay's team.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.229
- Mmm.
- That's why I ordered these Glide Rights.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.800
If you break 'em in properly,

00:18.880 --> 00:21.156
they're supposed to give you
a completely frictionless-

00:23.040 --> 00:24.633
If I'm being honest,

00:24.720 --> 00:27.440
the reunion might be
a little more fun if Phil isn't there.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.115
Otherwise, I spend the whole weekend
telling him who's who...

00:30.200 --> 00:31.839
and explaining inside jokes,

00:31.920 --> 00:36.517
and if all that explaining is going out,
the alcohol is not going in.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.921
Hey, Mom, before you go,
you have to sign this for school.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.992
You don't have to read it.
It's all boilerplate.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.390
- Honey, I am running really late.
- Ask your dad.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.637
Right here, buddy.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.680
I have to get a letter signed because I failed
my assignment on the Revolutionary War.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.390
I re-created the Battle of Bunker Hill
using one of my old science projects.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.631
Seemed pretty revolutionary to me.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.360
The brave patriots
made their way up the hillside,

00:58.440 --> 01:01.558
prepared for whatever the devious
redcoats might inflict next.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.836
Now you work?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.798
So, Dad-
One second, buddy.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.116
The salesman said
when you're breaking these shoes in,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.760
it's easier
to move side to side.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.390
Son of a gun. He was right.
What do we got here?

01:18.280 --> 01:19.028
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:26.360 --> 01:27.510
♪ Hey♪ ♪

01:32.240 --> 01:34.311
I've waited a
year for this day-

01:34.400 --> 01:37.393
the annual trade association
scratch bowling tournament.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.597
Last year we lost to our biggest rival.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.273
Frazier had Ali.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.478
Pritchett's Closets
has Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.074
It's a stupid name,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.197
but those cats can bowl.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.239
Ay, I knew the pancakes
will bring you down.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.232
Just coffee for me today-

01:53.320 --> 01:55.277
black, like I feel on the inside.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.671
Ay, Manny, please.
It was only one bad audition.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.752
No. Three bad auditions:

02:00.840 --> 02:04.038
the fall assembly, Phantom
and now the Spring Sing.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.794
- I'm a disaster.
- You're always so dramatic.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.314
Dramatic, Mother?

02:08.440 --> 02:10.800
I am sure Cam is gonna call you today
and give you the solo.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.394
You're always so hard on yourself.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.157
Remember that you said
that you didn't have a face for hats? And?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.749
- I look great in every hat.
- I can't hear you.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.638
I look great in every hat.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.677
Well, enjoy that while it lasts.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.640
I had a pretty good hat run, but then I saw
a photo of myself from the dude ranch.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.632
I looked like Reba at the Grammys.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.791
- I see that you found the fur.
- Yes.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.161
Uh, you wouldn't happen to have
a feather boa, would you?

02:34.280 --> 02:37.034
Are you wearing that to your Oscar party?
No, Manny.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.999
We're not clichés. Cam's decorating
the party with photos of Lily...

02:40.080 --> 02:41.958
dressed as different starlets from the-

02:42.040 --> 02:43.474
We're clichés.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.559
Hey, Gloria, look what I found
in my bowling bag.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.836
Second place prize
in last year's tournament.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.872
A spa day.
Ohh!

02:51.000 --> 02:54.118
Oh, but it expires today.
Oh, sorry.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.080
I just wish that I could use this,
but today's the nanny's day off...

02:58.160 --> 02:59.674
and I have
a million things to do.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.037
I have to buy diapers.
I have to go pick up the stroller.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.197
I have to go to the doctor.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.672
I hate wasting this,
but I just don't have any time today.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.514
Yes, I would have loved
to go to the spa.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.513
But having a baby
has changed completely...

03:15.600 --> 03:17.910
the way that Jay's family look at me.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.676
I am not anymore
just Gloria that has her hair done,

03:21.760 --> 03:23.717
Gloria that goes to the gym.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.110
Now I am Gloria the new mother,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.396
the "I don't know
how she does it" lady.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.558
If the feather boa is not here,
it's at my cousin's.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.109
I will go get it after the doctor,
after the pharmacy,

03:34.200 --> 03:35.714
before the baby store, okay?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.757
Honestly, Gloria,
I don't know how you do it.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.752
- Ah, I found it.
- Yes!

03:40.640 --> 03:42.552
Help me.
Careful.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.400
Gloria, are you all right?

03:45.520 --> 03:48.194
Ay, I told you to help me.
I am so sorry.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.074
I twisted my ankle.
Sit down right here.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.799
I don't have time for this.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.752
You-You can't walk around
on that all day.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.230
No, I'm good. I'm good.
No.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.471
I will use...

03:59.560 --> 04:02.394
the baby carrier as a-
as a cane.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.392
Okay?
O-Okay.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.120
Hold that.
Hold that. Good. Good.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.913
Now smolder. Smolder.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.514
Perfect. Perfect.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.080
Let me guess.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.358
You couldn't remember if I said "boa"
or "baby," so you brought both.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.591
Gloria hurt herself,
and it was kind of my fault,

04:19.680 --> 04:21.637
so I offered to watch Joe.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.838
- Oh.
- Can I take a break? I want to be alone.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.072
Okay, where was that attitude
when we were doing Greta Garbo?

04:28.160 --> 04:29.833
Okay, fine. Take five.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.355
Hi, baby Joe.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.399
Why don't you just sit a spell?
We're just makin' pictures.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.960
Why are you being all Missouri?

04:37.040 --> 04:39.191
I don't know. I guess I'm excited
to go back to the farm.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.351
- Is it that obvious?
- You said "dagburn" at breakfast.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.194
- Have you booked our tickets?
- I'm not sure if I can get off work.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.795
Yeah, but you have to get the tickets
before all the good seats are taken.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.792
You mean the ones that aren't
on a plane to Missouri.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.280
- Okay, sweetie, break's over.
- It hasn't been five minutes.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.317
Yes, but it has been
five animal crackers,

04:53.400 --> 04:55.710
which is five too many
to eat on a shoot day, so-

04:55.800 --> 04:58.156
No more! I quit!

04:58.240 --> 05:00.152
Oh, my gosh.
What has gotten into her?

05:00.240 --> 05:02.835
We've been doing this for six hours.
All of a sudden she doesn't love it?

05:02.920 --> 05:05.640
- You know, I have a theory.
- Okay.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.916
We're only halfway through
all the pictures that I wanted to do.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.511
Light bulb. Hello, baby Joe.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.115
Well, you might
as well be a dead hobo...

05:14.200 --> 05:16.635
in the woods of a small town
after a rainstorm,

05:16.720 --> 05:19.440
because you have
just been discovered.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.399
I'm looking less and less forward
to this trip to Missouri.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.631
Hey, handsome.
Can you sign this?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.474
You don't need to read it.
Never do.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.074
Right there.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.992
Oh, quick.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.594
Nature's surefire sunburn remedy.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.273
Aloe?

05:36.920 --> 05:39.515
Hey, Jay.
Super excited about our big match.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.354
I dreamt about it last night.
Guess what. We won!

05:42.440 --> 05:45.558
Phil, I like you too much to sugarcoat
what I'm about to say.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.120
You're off the team.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.119
Good one. Loosen me up
with some pre-match humor. I like it.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.240
No, I found somebody better-
Rudy Sorrenson. He's in. You're out.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.039
Hilarious.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.670
Sticking with the bit.
I love that this is our relationship now.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.320
This match is too important,
and you're a wild card. I'm sorry.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.394
Jay, I'm not sure I like
where this is headed.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.949
Phil, this is nothing personal.
It's bowling.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.276
No, no, no. I get it.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.955
Listen.
Um, I should get going.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.157
My allergies are starting to cry.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.956
Hey, Gloria, I was just about to leave.
What's up?

06:24.040 --> 06:26.509
Manny just texted me.
Did he tell you the news?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.876
Yes. Wonderful.
We'll celebrate later.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.954
No. He didn't get the solo.
I think he's very upset.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.396
Aaah! My glove. Where are you?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.870
At the doctor.
He's checking my ankle.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.674
Jay, I think you should
try to cheer him up.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.433
Why don't you
take him shopping?

06:42.520 --> 06:45.115
Gloria, my match is at 5:00.
I have a ritual.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.669
I walk the lanes. I play two
or three warm-up games.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.599
He's fine.
I'll let you talk to him.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.153
Darkness, please.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.152
Oh, shoot.
He's out in the pool.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.361
- What do I have to do to make you go away? Sing?
- I'll have him call you back.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.393
My life is a musicless
gray hellscape.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.712
Wow. Well, this doesn't look like anything
shopping can help you with.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.632
It's worth a shot.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.359
Sorry I was so indecisive back there.
I'm out of it today.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.591
Well, you got what you want,
and that's what today is all about.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.560
Turn that frown upside down. Now, you're
gonna take this 15 local to get home.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.031
Keep both your hands tight on that bag because
it goes through a few sketchy blocks.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.834
You're not driving me? Well, you
kind of used up your drive time...

07:29.920 --> 07:32.151
deciding between
those identical belts.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.960
Okay. It's just hard,
you know, Jay?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.713
I mean, I've never
been a quitter.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.951
Well, new chapter for you.
You got any change?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.714
I mean, I always imagined
I'd be a performer for life.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.712
I guess some dreams
you just have to give up on.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.599
Know when to fold 'em. Here's a 50.
Someone will have change.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.434
I can't sing, period.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.398
What am I thinking?

07:52.480 --> 07:55.473
The 11 goes right by the house,
and there she is.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.677
Now, text your mom
when you get home.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.191
- Good luck with your bowling.
- Thanks, kid.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.634
Yes. Yes.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.792
You've had my dad's baby for 45 minutes,
and he's already in a dress.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.635
Okay, Lily, I think we're ready for our
most important setup-Miss Shirley Temple.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.592
Here.
Oh, wow.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.195
- You're an even better assistant than you are a model.
- I don't care.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.272
Well, that came through
in her modeling.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.274
Our daughter.
I know, but it just hurts, Mitchell.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.677
It's the first one of our things
that she's outgrown.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.116
But isn't it great that we've raised her
to have opinions and interests of her own?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.708
But this early?
She's still so dadgum young.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.240
Is that another Southern thing, or are you
just trying to remember her Vietnamese name?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.272
- Oh, my gosh. This thing is stuck.
- What?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.272
- How-How could it be?
- It is stuck.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.033
- Oh.
- I glued it.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.039
Wha-Why-Why
would you do that?

08:48.120 --> 08:50.635
Because the Jane Crawford wig
kept falling off him.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.190
It's Joan Crawford. 'Cause
that's what's important here.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.795
It's glued to his actual hair.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.272
Okay, Lily, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.113
Sorry. I was trying to help.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.953
Okay, well,
I should've seen this coming.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.554
I replaced her
with somebody younger,

09:05.640 --> 09:08.030
and she sabotaged Joe's shoot
out of sheer jealousy.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.760
Maybe she does have
what it takes to be a model.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.672
Can you-

09:12.800 --> 09:17.511
♪ And as funny
as it may seem ♪

09:17.600 --> 09:19.432
- Sing.
- What?

09:19.520 --> 09:21.830
I've heard you sing in the shower.
You sing in the car with me.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.118
You never miss a note. Your problem
is doing it around people. Sing.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.920
- You want me to sing now?
- Yeah! It's all in your head.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.516
When you get over that little stage fright,
you'll never choke an audition again. Sing!

09:31.600 --> 09:34.877
I've been a puppet,
a pauper, a pirate, a poet

09:34.960 --> 09:36.394
That's not singing.
Attack it!

09:36.480 --> 09:37.994
A pawn and a king

09:38.080 --> 09:41.596
I've been up and down
and over and out

09:41.680 --> 09:43.114
And I know one thing

09:43.200 --> 09:45.078
What's that thing?

09:45.160 --> 09:48.676
Each time I found myself
flat on my face

09:48.760 --> 09:50.240
Yeah, now you got it!

09:50.360 --> 09:52.317
I pick myself up and
get back in the race

09:52.400 --> 09:54.915
Get in that bag!
I know you want to!

09:55.000 --> 09:58.038
- That's life
- Sing it to me, baby!

09:58.120 --> 09:59.952
That's what all
the people say

10:00.120 --> 10:03.238
Oh, my God.
Is that Janie Gibbs?

10:03.320 --> 10:05.710
Yikes. Her skin
looks like crumpled tinfoil...

10:05.800 --> 10:07.757
you try to smooth out
and use again.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.878
Remind me not to get old
in front of you.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.670
I don't even see
the kids' faces anymore.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.793
I know them by the decals
on their laptops.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.991
Professor Cooke.
Mmm.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.999
Still the sexiest man on campus.
Wanna know a little somethin'?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.634
You dated him?

10:24.720 --> 10:27.076
How did you know that?
We were so careful with that secret.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.436
You wore an oversized
tweed jacket to breakfast...

10:29.520 --> 10:31.398
and called my Rabbit convertible
"bourgeois."

10:31.520 --> 10:34.672
Well, it kind of was.
We were so jealous of you.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.310
He was so hot, jogging around
campus in those dolphin shorts.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.837
And that wasn't even why I was with him.
It was his mind.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.436
You know those people who make you
feel smart just by being near them?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.756
I watched you guys once.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.152
Claire? Claire's friend.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.232
He remembers me.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.198
Hello, Professor.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.192
Mwah! Wow.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.357
It's so good to see you.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.000
Clearly, the academic life
agrees with you.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.430
Well, I guess we're all
doing pretty well. Mm-hmm.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.954
Cheers.
Cheers.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.039
Here's looking at you two.
Were you always like this?

11:09.160 --> 11:11.550
Claire? Oh, my God.
No way.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.950
Tater! Oh, my gosh!

11:14.040 --> 11:16.794
I heard you're hugely successful.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.475
Yeah, well,
when all the hot girls call you "Tater,"

11:19.600 --> 11:22.752
you tend to try a little harder.
Adorable. Adorable!

11:22.840 --> 11:24.354
You're adorable!

11:24.440 --> 11:26.318
Claire! Honey! Hey.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.596
Hi. Phil!
What are you doing here?

11:28.680 --> 11:31.673
Uh, your dad dumped me
from his bowling team,

11:31.760 --> 11:33.274
so I thought I'd surprise you.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.240
Um-Okay. Wait.
Come here a second.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.232
I- I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.516
I am. No, I am. I'm happy.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.353
Is something wrong?

11:43.440 --> 11:46.000
It's just-
It's a little bit embarrassing.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.549
The guy that I dated
right before you is here.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.950
Well, that's nothing to be embarrassed about.
We all have exes.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.681
So the guy you dumped right before
you met me is here. No big deal.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.558
Well-

11:55.640 --> 11:57.313
He might have dumped me.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.915
I thought you said
you'd never been dumped.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.310
Well-Maybe one time.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.518
So he dumped you,

12:05.600 --> 12:07.990
you healed completely,
and then you met me.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.316
Well-

12:12.000 --> 12:15.516
I've regretted throwing away things
way more beaten up than Claire.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.913
So if this campus Casanova had thoughts
of reclaiming her-Guess what, hotshot.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.118
Legally, I still own her.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.194
Man, I always wondered who'd be lucky enough
to marry the beautiful Claire Pritchett.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.840
No luck involved, hombre.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.389
She saw, she liked,
she got pregnant, she had to.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.831
Hey, stop hogging this guy.
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.957
My Tater.
Look, I've got to run.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.511
But I'd love to have you guys by my
apartment for a cocktail before dinner.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.239
We are totally doing that.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.829
We might have to go back to the
hotel for a while. No, no, no.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.434
That's what
this weekend's for-

12:47.520 --> 12:49.477
having a laugh,
meeting new people.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.472
I don't wanna miss any of it.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.074
Oh, my God.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.595
And I don't miss much.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.872
Close the door.
You're letting the steam out.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.198
Is the wig coming loose? Oh, yes, Mitchell.
It's completely off his head.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.239
We're just staying in here because there's
nothing babies and big guys love more...

13:07.320 --> 13:08.800
than 100% humidity.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.554
My God, do you realize what Gloria's
gonna do when she sees this?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.950
She punched me when I got
Manny that henna tattoo.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.430
And not the side-of-the-hand way
that I do it.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.677
This had rings and knuckles.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.877
Don't worry.
I'm working on a plan B.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.317
Or should I say plan Bieber?

13:24.440 --> 13:26.636
No! Huh? No, I just gave him
a little bit of a haircut.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.393
Give me the baby.
I know.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.074
That's the great part
of my schedule.

13:33.160 --> 13:37.120
We make it to Europe almost every summer.
But I'm sure you guys travel.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.160
Well, honestly, I don't think I've been
anywhere without a waterslide in 15 years.

13:42.840 --> 13:47.960
That's funny. She's mentioned Esther,
Dougie, Tripp, Afro Judy-

13:48.040 --> 13:52.637
The name "Tater" has literally never
even come up once in the last 20 years.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.313
I don't know why I'm surprised.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.153
I was madly in love with her
for four years,

13:56.240 --> 13:59.438
and I was basically invisible until
the day I choked on that Tater Tot.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.910
Wait. I-I-I thought
you were her ex.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.640
I wish.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.719
So, Phil, are
you here all weekend?

14:07.800 --> 14:09.234
No.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.789
That's too bad. I was gonna
suggest some activities.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.317
The Palmer Center's doing a wonderful
retrospective of impressionists.

14:15.400 --> 14:19.189
Oh, that is a shame. That's a
field I know quite a bit about.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.919
Ah.
Phil, no.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.673
You can see the influence,
can't you,

14:22.760 --> 14:25.116
of the, uh,
early impressionists-

14:25.200 --> 14:29.194
the, uh, Rich Littles,
the Frank Gorshins-

14:29.280 --> 14:32.159
on the Jimmy Fallons,
if you will.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.192
He meant the painter kind.
Yes.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.272
- Freshen your drink?
- No. No. Not done.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.871
You'd know if I was finished with
something, and I'm not. Oh. Hmm.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.834
- Oh, just the one then.
- Yeah.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.714
What are you doing? I'm sorry. Did I
embarrass you in front of your ex-boyfriend?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.516
Yeah, I know about that. Because I told you.
You can't seriously be jealous.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.475
Well-
Phil, it was 20 years ago.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.119
Rein it in.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.317
Come on.
You're embarrassing me a little.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.073
Fine. But do you deny
that part of the reason...

14:59.160 --> 15:01.550
you wanted to come back here
by yourself is that guy?

15:01.640 --> 15:03.711
I'm not even sure
it's a bad thing, Claire.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.561
We all wonder about the paths we
didn't follow, but you can admit it.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.640
Well, you can't be mad at me
if I do admit it. I won't.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.031
Well, I'm not admitting it-

15:16.120 --> 15:19.238
because I couldn't be happier
than I am in my life with you.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.073
But-

15:21.160 --> 15:24.392
I mean, maybe
a tiny part of me...

15:24.480 --> 15:27.075
just wanted to sort of peek
through the window...

15:27.160 --> 15:29.311
and see the life
that might have been.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.917
Never get tired
of those three flights.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.754
Maggie!
Say hi to everyone.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.917
In a second, angel.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.032
- Mama's had a day.
- Huh.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.072
Oh, I thought
that was the bedroom.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.833
You're in the bedroom, honey,

15:45.920 --> 15:48.992
and the living room
and the study and the gym.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.477
Hmm. But anyway, listen to me.
I'm being rude.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.392
How is everybody?
How's things?

15:54.480 --> 15:58.190
- Not too bad.
- No, I'm literally asking you how is it to have things.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.716
Oh. Yep. Right on schedule.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.712
Keep it down, you hoodrats!

16:04.800 --> 16:06.632
Maggie, you were once a student.

16:06.720 --> 16:11.033
I remember. That's when I boarded
this little rocket ship to the moon.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.192
Ah.
Wow.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.794
Phil, wait. Thank you.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.196
For what?
Everything.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.476
I'm not sure how that guy
got to be a professor.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.438
He'd have to be pretty stupid
to dump you.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.354
Aw! Hey, the party's starting,

16:27.440 --> 16:30.080
and there's a really good-looking guy
I was hoping to do a little dancing with.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.998
Do you mean me?
Yes.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.879
Wait. Before we go, are there any
more exes I should know about?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.474
Honey, what do you think
I was like?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.153
Hey, Claire Pritchett.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.630
Hey, Dean Stoller.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.155
Super quick story.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.757
All right, it's not
too late for plan C.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.793
We drop the baby and run.
What? No.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.679
You have to tell her what you did.
You scalped her baby.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.717
I had to cut that wig off.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.554
What did you expect me to do?
He keeps pulling his hat off.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.474
Okay, well, you could've let me do it.
I have 32 hours of Vidal Sassoon training.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.837
What? I left the program
over creative differences. Shut up.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.838
Hola.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.440
Hola.
Hola.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.240
Oh, there's my little angel.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.198
How was he?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.670
Uh, th-there's
a funny story here.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.036
Gloria, forget about that baby...

17:18.119 --> 17:19.952
and check out this one!

17:20.079 --> 17:24.199
You beat Closets,
Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.760
We destroyed them!

17:25.880 --> 17:28.315
And it's Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.
What did I say?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.796
We went through this for a half hour yesterday.
I can't do it again.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.599
Nope. You're gonna
have to tell her.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.110
What? Why? Because she
has two new rings.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.833
That's gonna take
the meat right off the bone.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.391
Okay, Cam. You take the fall for me,
and I will go with you to Missouri.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.836
- I'll even go for a whole week.
- Make it 10 days.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.954
Okay, fine. But I don't wanna meet anything
on Monday that I'm gonna eat on Friday.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.520
Oh, well, that's gonna happen.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.399
Oh, my perfect angel.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.512
- You got this. You're good.
- Ay.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.320
Gloria, do you remember that chafing
dish I lent you a couple months back...

17:56.400 --> 17:58.039
that you returned with a chip in it?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.112
Every time that Luke comes over,

18:00.200 --> 18:03.955
he takes things out of the attic
and leaves them just ever here!

18:04.040 --> 18:05.759
Oh. Yeah.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.920
Well, you know, funny thing about that
chafing dish is it was my grandmother's-

18:08.960 --> 18:10.474
and it was given to her-

18:10.560 --> 18:12.040
Luke!

18:16.320 --> 18:20.553
Oh, hey, Manny. Glad I ran into you. Listen.
I'm gonna give you the solo.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.996
Really? You must have heard
what happened to me today.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.040
I feel confident now, and I know I
could-I don't care about any of that.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.118
I just need you to tell your mom that you
gave your brother Joe a haircut, okay?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.431
No problem.
How bad could it be?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.510
Aaah!

18:34.920 --> 18:37.435
Anyway, I heard you need
a letter from school signed.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.080
I kind of nailed
my Declaration of Independence replica.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.038
Forged every signature
with this pen.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.629
So-
Stop. We have a deal.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.633
I'll say I cut the baby's hair,
and you give me that cool pen.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.430
- What? No, no. That's not what I was gonna-
- Deal's a deal.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.113
A thief, Lily.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.396
That's who ate
my last piece of cake...

18:55.480 --> 18:58.234
that my mother send me
specially from Colombia.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.630
It helps you make the milk.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.958
Such a cool trophy.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.073
- Say, how did that new guy, Rudy Sorrenson, do?
- He was great.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.640
It's funny
how he has the same name...

19:10.720 --> 19:13.280
as one-time pro bowler
Rudolph Sorrenson,

19:13.360 --> 19:15.920
which would be
against league rules.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.798
Well, I'd find it funny.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.474
Jay, hurry up. You have to
take the kids to the movie.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.871
And why does the baby still have that hat on?
He's going to burn up.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.270
Gloria, I have
a confession to make.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.717
I gave Joe a haircut.
It's bad.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.912
Why would you do that? My dad used
to cut my hair when I was a kid,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.595
and I thought it'd be a nice way
for the baby and me to bond,

19:38.680 --> 19:41.673
but I just made
a mess of things-

19:41.760 --> 19:44.195
like I make
a mess of everything.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.273
Let me take a look at this.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.874
¡Ay, dios mio!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.640
Dad, why would you do that
to your own son?

19:51.720 --> 19:54.599
- He's just a baby.
- Plus you ate that cake.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.637
Okay, enough.
Leave him alone.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.951
He could have invented
some crazy story,

19:59.040 --> 20:01.635
but instead he decided
to tell the truth.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.031
- That's what families do.
- Yes, it is.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.157
Okay, go. Go, go, go.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.596
Uh, Lily, sweetie,
we're leaving. Come on!

20:08.680 --> 20:12.560
I know that they expected
me to go all Colombian crazy,

20:12.640 --> 20:14.791
but this was just
another opportunity for me...

20:14.880 --> 20:19.113
to show them that I was not the
superficial Gloria that I used to be.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.955
Plus, I was very relaxed
after the day I had.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.471
Aaah! Where are you?

20:29.560 --> 20:32.280
At the doctor.
He's checking my ankle.

20:32.360 --> 20:36.639
What? Did you think I was gonna
throw away a whole spa day?

20:39.320 --> 20:42.552
I'm coming, Fulgencio!

20:48.080 --> 20:50.595
Why am I doing this again?

20:50.680 --> 20:53.991
Dad'll get a kick out of it. Like when
we were young and used to wear his shoes.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.878
Now get up
and take a few steps.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.999
Did Dad ask for this?
No, but he'll love it.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.639
Maybe dance around.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.713
Okay, now jump.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.757
What kind of video is this?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.433
I've got to go to work. I'm sorry.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.119
Okay, thanks.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.953
What the hell?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.360
Finally!
