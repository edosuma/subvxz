<i>McKenzie: Face Off is back</i>

00:02.867 --> 00:04.100
<i>with some of your
favorite artists.</i>

00:10.642 --> 00:12.942
This is Face Off All Stars.

00:23.888 --> 00:25.554
Dude, how crazy is it?
We're back.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.390
- We are back.
- I'm so pumped.

00:27.425 --> 00:29.558
- We need a team name, though.
- Uh...

00:29.594 --> 00:31.694
- Neutroester?
- Neutroestron?

00:31.729 --> 00:33.229
I'm George Troester.

00:33.264 --> 00:34.563
And I'm Cig Neutron.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.265
And together, we form...

00:36.300 --> 00:38.701
together: Team Troetron.

00:38.736 --> 00:40.736
<i>I think we really bonded
season seven.</i>

00:40.772 --> 00:42.204
<i>When we made Big Tuna...</i>

00:42.240 --> 00:43.906
<i>We became closer than friends.</i>

00:43.941 --> 00:46.342
<i>More like brothers,
and we work well</i>

00:46.377 --> 00:49.011
'cause he pushes me to do
stuff crazier,

00:49.047 --> 00:53.249
and I push him do to stuff
a little more based in reality.

00:53.284 --> 00:55.284
Just a bunch
of lovable goofballs.

00:55.319 --> 00:57.286
Lovable.
Look at us.

00:57.321 --> 01:00.322
- Gonna hold my hand?
- Yeah.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.160
"All Stars"!

01:04.194 --> 01:06.562
Here we are, once again, bro.

01:06.597 --> 01:08.497
- Team Love.
- Team Love.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.366
- This is Niko.
- And this is Cat.

01:10.401 --> 01:12.868
And we were both on season six
of Face Off.

01:12.904 --> 01:14.570
<i>Not only are we
boyfriend and girlfriend,</i>

01:14.605 --> 01:16.806
<i>but we work together
a lot as well.</i>

01:16.841 --> 01:18.741
<i>We own a company together,
so I definitely think</i>

01:18.776 --> 01:20.309
<i>we can use that
to our advantage.</i>

01:20.344 --> 01:21.777
We're gonna rock this.

01:21.813 --> 01:24.146
<i>Our team name is Team Love.</i>

01:24.182 --> 01:26.382
No.

01:26.417 --> 01:29.351
<i>Okay, I guess.</i>

01:33.758 --> 01:35.024
I can't think
of a better teammate.

01:35.059 --> 01:36.258
I mean, Rick Baker
would be nice,

01:36.294 --> 01:37.226
but you're a good second.

01:37.261 --> 01:38.561
Thanks, man.

01:38.596 --> 01:40.629
I'm Logan, and I was a finalist
on season eight.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.064
And I'm Adam,
and I should have been

01:42.100 --> 01:43.766
a finalist on season eight.

01:43.801 --> 01:46.969
<i>I think we have what it takes
to win this competition.</i>

01:47.004 --> 01:48.337
<i>I have a one-month-old
baby at home,</i>

01:48.372 --> 01:50.739
so that also is
an extra motivating factor.

01:50.775 --> 01:52.374
I'm pretty stoked to be
working together.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.743
<i>Logan's gonna bring a lot of
practical application</i>

01:54.779 --> 01:56.612
to what I like to do.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.347
<i>And Adam's concepts
are really inspiring,</i>

01:58.382 --> 02:00.483
and I think we're gonna do well.

02:00.518 --> 02:02.485
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.886
He said it perfectly.

02:03.921 --> 02:06.755
- Love you, man.
- Love you too.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.093
- Look at that cool lighthouse.
- Oh, that's cool.

02:11.129 --> 02:13.262
Wonder what kind of challenges
they're gonna throw at us.

02:13.297 --> 02:14.964
I'm Gage, from season one.

02:14.999 --> 02:16.565
I'm Rachael, from season seven.

02:16.601 --> 02:18.801
And together, we're...
Team Rage.

02:18.836 --> 02:21.303
<i>- Team Rage is here to, uh...
- Kick some ass.</i>

02:21.339 --> 02:23.005
<i>Yeah.
It's really surreal</i>

02:23.040 --> 02:24.273
<i>for the both of us,
'cause it's been</i>

02:24.308 --> 02:26.242
a really long time
since I've been on.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.644
I feel like they resurrected
a dinosaur, but, um...

02:28.679 --> 02:29.945
<i>We're one of</i>

02:29.981 --> 02:31.747
<i>the very few teams
fortunate enough</i>

02:31.782 --> 02:34.950
to work together
prior to being here.

02:34.986 --> 02:36.252
<i>Gage invited me to work with him</i>

02:36.287 --> 02:38.621
<i>on a music video
for Fall Out Boy.</i>

02:38.656 --> 02:40.523
<i>And then,
a commercial in Brazil.</i>

02:40.558 --> 02:42.124
Working together has given us

02:42.160 --> 02:43.726
a better idea of
where we stand, and...

02:43.761 --> 02:45.628
<i>That'll be a bonus for us.</i>

02:45.663 --> 02:48.364
- Team Rage.
- Yes, Team Rage.

02:50.168 --> 02:52.601
- OG over here!
- Season one!

02:55.239 --> 02:56.472
Where is McKenzie?

02:56.507 --> 02:58.440
It's not Face Off until
McKenzie gets here.

02:58.476 --> 02:59.975
<i>When we reach the lighthouse,</i>

03:00.011 --> 03:01.410
we're all looking around
and wondering

03:01.445 --> 03:03.312
where McKenzie is.

03:07.685 --> 03:09.418
<i>And then there's this helicopter</i>

03:09.453 --> 03:10.853
<i>drifting towards us.</i>

03:10.888 --> 03:12.521
And it's starting to set in

03:12.557 --> 03:14.023
that this is actually
happening again.

03:14.058 --> 03:15.758
- What?
- Whoa.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:32.788 --> 03:34.566
Thank you very much.

03:38.049 --> 03:39.014
Hey, guys!

03:39.050 --> 03:40.149
All: Hi!

03:40.184 --> 03:41.917
Welcome back to Face Off.

03:41.953 --> 03:44.286
All: Yeah!

03:44.322 --> 03:46.222
I didn't believe it
until I saw you.

03:46.257 --> 03:48.057
<i>It's so cool to see McKenzie.</i>

03:48.092 --> 03:51.360
This is the best entrance
she's ever had.

03:51.395 --> 03:53.229
Now before we get started,
I want to thank

03:53.264 --> 03:54.730
my friends at the US Coast Guard

03:54.765 --> 03:56.432
for helping me arrive in style.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

03:59.937 --> 04:02.671
Now, as All-Stars,
I'm sure you think

04:02.707 --> 04:05.007
you know what to expect
this time around.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.409
But I'm here to tell you that

04:07.445 --> 04:10.112
everything you think you know
about Face Off,

04:10.147 --> 04:11.880
you can just throw
out the window.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.148
Of course.

04:13.184 --> 04:14.250
Because this season
is gonna be filled

04:14.285 --> 04:16.084
with twists and turns,

04:16.120 --> 04:17.886
and you are never gonna know
when they're coming.

04:17.922 --> 04:19.622
Oh, my God.

04:19.656 --> 04:21.055
All right, well,
as you already know,

04:21.091 --> 04:22.558
you're competing in teams.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.793
Now, you're gonna win as a team,

04:24.829 --> 04:26.328
and lose as a team.

04:26.364 --> 04:27.296
- Oh.
- Ooh.

04:27.331 --> 04:28.264
- Okay.
- Aah.

04:28.299 --> 04:30.032
So if you are eliminated,

04:30.067 --> 04:32.234
it's your team
that will be going home,

04:32.270 --> 04:33.435
not an individual.

04:33.471 --> 04:34.770
- Yup.
- Fun.

04:34.805 --> 04:36.905
But here's the thing...
we won't be eliminating

04:36.941 --> 04:39.208
a team every week, either.

04:39.243 --> 04:40.676
Oh.

04:40.711 --> 04:44.179
Instead, we'll award immunity
to a winning team one week,

04:44.215 --> 04:46.715
and eliminate a team
the next week.

04:46.751 --> 04:48.384
- Ah.
- Okay.

04:48.419 --> 04:49.885
- All right.
- Like your style.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.654
So the judges will get
to see your work

04:51.689 --> 04:54.123
from two challenges
before deciding

04:54.158 --> 04:56.025
which team is eliminated.

04:56.060 --> 04:56.925
- Awesome.
- Wow.

04:56.961 --> 04:58.460
Yes.

04:58.496 --> 05:00.629
I never had immunity
on my season

05:00.665 --> 05:04.133
because Rachael won
every Foundation Challenge,

05:04.168 --> 05:06.568
<i>and she always got the immunity.</i>

05:06.604 --> 05:08.237
Not this time, Rachael!

05:08.272 --> 05:09.538
Well, why don't we just dive
right into

05:09.573 --> 05:10.939
your first Spotlight Challenge?

05:10.975 --> 05:12.508
- Yeah.
- Let's get it, do it.

05:12.543 --> 05:14.243
In films like War Of The Worlds

05:14.278 --> 05:15.878
<i>and The Abyss,</i>

05:15.913 --> 05:18.781
the strange and surreal
creatures in the deep ocean

05:18.816 --> 05:22.051
have provided inspiration for
out-of-this-world beings.

05:22.086 --> 05:24.286
And today, they'll serve
as inspiration

05:24.322 --> 05:26.388
for your very own
alien creation.

05:26.424 --> 05:28.023
I am so good with that.

05:28.059 --> 05:29.591
- But...
- But...

05:31.262 --> 05:32.961
However...

05:32.997 --> 05:35.197
- However...
- Mm.

05:35.232 --> 05:38.000
Because you are All-Stars,

05:38.035 --> 05:40.502
we're gonna take it
one step further.

05:40.538 --> 05:42.171
- All right.
- Of course.

05:42.206 --> 05:44.006
We want your aliens to be unlike

05:44.041 --> 05:46.375
anything we have ever seen
before on the show.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.710
What does that mean?

05:47.745 --> 05:49.611
So, for the first time

05:49.647 --> 05:51.880
in Face Off history,

05:51.916 --> 05:53.849
you'll be integrating
green screen technology...

05:53.884 --> 05:54.850
- Yes!
- Into your makeup!

05:54.885 --> 05:56.318
- Whoo!
- How cool is that?

05:59.156 --> 06:01.090
I've never done anything
with a green screen before,

06:01.125 --> 06:02.624
but I understand how it works,

06:02.660 --> 06:04.526
so I'm really excited
to use the technology.

06:04.562 --> 06:06.929
So this means
you can digitally remove

06:06.964 --> 06:08.430
any part of your model
as you desire.

06:08.466 --> 06:09.365
- Oh!
- What?

06:09.400 --> 06:12.000
- Isn't it exciting?
- This is gonna be amazing.

06:12.036 --> 06:13.969
All right, each team
will be selecting

06:14.004 --> 06:15.971
an unusual deep-sea creature

06:16.006 --> 06:17.906
to inspire their creation.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.475
- Deal.
- Hmm.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.976
Emily and Tyler,
you're up first.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.545
Ooh.

06:23.581 --> 06:25.147
Oh.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.054
Ooh.

06:32.089 --> 06:33.589
Oh!

06:34.859 --> 06:36.492
All right, guys, as always,

06:36.527 --> 06:38.594
my dad, Michael Westmore,
will come by later on

06:38.629 --> 06:40.362
and check in on your progress.

06:40.398 --> 06:41.530
- All right.
- Perfect.

06:41.565 --> 06:42.698
Can't wait.
Awesome.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.700
Go ahead and get started
on your designs.

06:44.735 --> 06:45.734
- Yeah!
- Good luck!

06:45.770 --> 06:46.602
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

06:53.577 --> 06:55.878
- So excited!
- So excited, yeah.

06:55.913 --> 06:58.013
I'm Tyler.
I was a finalist on season six.

06:58.048 --> 07:00.549
And I'm Emily, and I was
a finalist on season eight.

07:00.584 --> 07:02.684
<i>We've never worked together,
and I'm so glad</i>

07:02.720 --> 07:05.621
<i>that we get to because
I'm a fan of her work.</i>

07:05.656 --> 07:08.190
And Tyler is
an amazing sculptor.

07:08.225 --> 07:10.359
<i>- So, we are here to win.
- Absolutely.</i>

07:10.394 --> 07:11.827
We're both entrepreneurs.

07:11.862 --> 07:13.729
<i>I started my own wig business
with my mom.</i>

07:13.764 --> 07:16.565
And I created the Wonderband
Systems Organizer,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.834
and it keeps all of my tools
ready to go.

07:18.869 --> 07:19.768
- So...
- We're Team...

07:19.804 --> 07:21.203
together: Wonderful.

07:21.238 --> 07:22.471
Deep sea dragonfish.

07:22.506 --> 07:23.439
As an alien, I feel like

07:23.474 --> 07:25.040
it would be an invasive species.

07:25.075 --> 07:28.544
The deep sea dragonfish
lures its prey,

07:28.579 --> 07:31.647
<i>so our alien
is a seductive being.</i>

07:31.682 --> 07:33.582
<i>She lures her victims in,</i>

07:33.617 --> 07:36.218
and her beauty
is actually her weapon.

07:36.253 --> 07:38.353
Emily had a really good idea...
is to actually

07:38.389 --> 07:40.856
paint the green screen color

07:40.891 --> 07:43.392
to cut in the shape
of the model,

07:43.427 --> 07:46.395
so it'll give this
a concave feel to it.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.263
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Yeah.

07:48.299 --> 07:50.365
We wanted to do this the
entire time on season nine...

07:50.401 --> 07:51.867
- Yeah, yeah.
- And so, finally,

07:51.902 --> 07:53.101
- we get this chance.
- The whole...

07:53.137 --> 07:54.603
- Hopefully, the whole time.
- Yeah.

07:54.638 --> 07:57.005
- So, we're pretty pumped.
- Even... even af... even...

07:57.041 --> 07:58.240
- I mean...
- Yeah.

07:58.275 --> 08:01.410
- I'm Ben Ploughman.
- I'm Evan Hedges.

08:01.445 --> 08:04.780
- And we're from...
- Season nine!

08:04.815 --> 08:06.715
<i>It's super cool to be back,</i>

08:06.750 --> 08:08.417
<i>and finally getting a chance
to work together.</i>

08:08.452 --> 08:11.053
Yeah, and one advantage
that we have

08:11.088 --> 08:13.589
is that we're the only
team of finalists

08:13.624 --> 08:15.290
from the same season.

08:15.326 --> 08:16.191
We ain't nothing to fuck with.

08:16.227 --> 08:17.359
Yeah.

08:17.394 --> 08:18.594
What are you thinking about
for the body?

08:18.629 --> 08:19.995
What if we had, like,
a third back leg?

08:20.030 --> 08:21.763
- Like a...
- Yeah.

08:21.799 --> 08:23.632
<i>We got the Japanese spider crab.</i>

08:23.667 --> 08:26.235
<i>The idea is to remove
the actor's arms</i>

08:26.270 --> 08:28.337
<i>and legs so it looks like
he's floating</i>

08:28.372 --> 08:30.005
or he's hanging in these arms.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.407
I like the big arms.
I'm into that.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.476
I'm, like, getting all these,
like, chills and stuff.

08:34.511 --> 08:35.777
Yeah.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.347
We could go crazy with this.

08:38.381 --> 08:39.948
<i>I'm Jasmine, from season nine.</i>

08:39.984 --> 08:41.482
<i>I'm Stella, from season seven,</i>

08:41.519 --> 08:43.385
and we're gonna bring
something fierce

08:43.419 --> 08:45.287
to this competition.

08:45.322 --> 08:46.388
Hey.

08:46.423 --> 08:48.257
<i>We get a second shot at this,</i>

08:48.292 --> 08:49.525
<i>but we just want to have
a good time.</i>

08:49.560 --> 08:52.227
There's no stress,
there's no fear...

08:52.263 --> 08:53.395
No stress?

08:53.430 --> 08:55.330
<i>We're gonna join forces,</i>

08:55.366 --> 08:57.866
make art, and just be amazing.

08:57.902 --> 09:00.536
We're really feeling the power
together, for sure.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.505
<i>To create our helmet
jellyfish alien,</i>

09:03.541 --> 09:06.875
we decided we're just going to
take away her legs.

09:06.911 --> 09:09.044
<i>She's gonna be
floating through the air.</i>

09:09.079 --> 09:11.013
The same ideas are
coming out of our mouths,

09:11.048 --> 09:12.447
so I think it's perfect.

09:12.483 --> 09:14.016
- That's why you're my teammate.
- That's right.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.652
That's why we're
gonna take this.

09:16.687 --> 09:19.388
I like the idea of completely
obliterating the human form.

09:19.423 --> 09:21.723
I'm Melissa, this is Keaghlan,
and we're Team Merewolf.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.926
Team Merewolf!

09:23.961 --> 09:25.294
<i>We've never worked together,</i>

09:25.329 --> 09:27.796
<i>but Keaghlan's
an amazing designer...</i>

09:27.831 --> 09:30.198
<i>And your fabrication is a beast.</i>

09:30.234 --> 09:31.767
But most importantly,
Keaghlan's got

09:31.802 --> 09:33.735
beautiful blue hair
and eyebrows.

09:33.771 --> 09:35.904
Ah.
Gosh, thanks.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.707
<i>Both of us are really
high-concept designers,</i>

09:38.742 --> 09:41.343
and I don't think people know
what to expect about us,

09:41.378 --> 09:43.879
so I think that that's
definitely in our advantage.

09:43.914 --> 09:45.581
I want to use, like,
the shapes and the patterns

09:45.616 --> 09:47.215
and stuff as inspiration,
but I want it

09:47.251 --> 09:48.917
not to look like a fish.

09:48.953 --> 09:50.352
Uh-huh.
<i>We have the flying gurnard,</i>

09:50.387 --> 09:52.988
<i>and we want to create
a psychic alien queen.</i>

09:53.023 --> 09:55.090
<i>Her head's gonna be floating,
and she's gonna have</i>

09:55.125 --> 09:57.459
<i>separate fins that have links</i>

09:57.494 --> 10:00.062
<i>to smaller drones
controlled by her.</i>

10:00.097 --> 10:03.298
I'm concerned because how are we
gonna incorporate the back?

10:03.334 --> 10:04.633
It still needs to feel like
a 360-degree object.

10:04.668 --> 10:05.934
Yeah, no, I agree.
I agree.

10:05.970 --> 10:07.769
<i>These are bold,
conceptual risks,</i>

10:07.805 --> 10:10.038
and this is something
I've never done before.

10:10.074 --> 10:12.808
<i>And I have to admit, I'm
terrified of the green screen.</i>

10:12.843 --> 10:15.210
It's such a big thing
to wrap our heads around.

10:15.245 --> 10:18.313
Hey, everybody.
Let's get to work!

10:18.349 --> 10:19.781
This is All-Stars.

10:19.817 --> 10:21.516
Competition is higher than ever.

10:21.552 --> 10:23.719
So I want to really prove that

10:23.754 --> 10:25.654
we are in it to win it.

10:27.992 --> 10:29.424
<i>McKenzie: The winner of
Face Off All-Stars will</i>

10:29.460 --> 10:32.461
<i>receive a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-up</i>

10:32.496 --> 10:35.364
<i>to one of their 85
international locations,</i>

10:35.399 --> 10:38.066
<i>a brand-new
Hyundai Veloster,</i>

10:38.102 --> 10:40.602
<i>and $100,000.</i>

10:46.069 --> 10:47.769
It's so much bigger!

10:47.804 --> 10:49.436
This is crazy.

10:49.472 --> 10:50.872
We're back!

10:50.907 --> 10:52.373
<i>We're back in the lab.</i>

10:52.408 --> 10:54.676
It's like déjà vu
all over again.

10:54.711 --> 10:57.378
But this time, we've got the
green screen setup in the lab

10:57.413 --> 10:58.779
<i>so that we can test out
different things</i>

10:58.814 --> 11:01.248
<i>or just fool around
like I tend to do.</i>

11:01.284 --> 11:04.218
We've got a cold from coming in
from the north.

11:05.354 --> 11:06.620
It's so much fun.

11:09.024 --> 11:10.291
I'll start rocking
on the face...

11:10.326 --> 11:11.825
- Cool.
- And you have a really good

11:11.860 --> 11:13.760
idea for the legs, so do you
want to start building them?

11:13.796 --> 11:14.961
- Yes.
- George and I got

11:14.997 --> 11:17.297
the roughback batfish.

11:17.332 --> 11:19.766
It's got this weird, "ugh,"
face thing,

11:19.802 --> 11:22.069
<i>so we're really using
the facial expression</i>

11:22.104 --> 11:25.538
<i>to drive this weird,
aristocratic alien design.</i>

11:25.574 --> 11:27.540
<i>And since his planet
is low-gravity,</i>

11:27.576 --> 11:30.310
<i>we want our performer
to puppeteer legs,</i>

11:30.345 --> 11:32.345
<i>so when he flaps his wings,</i>

11:32.380 --> 11:34.747
he can make it look like
he's actually floating up.

11:34.782 --> 11:36.616
Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap!

11:36.651 --> 11:38.384
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

11:41.189 --> 11:42.455
I'm happy if you're happy.

11:42.490 --> 11:44.090
I'm happy if you're happy!

11:44.125 --> 11:45.991
We got the vampire squid.

11:46.027 --> 11:48.493
<i>He has big eyes and
a lot of fat wrinkles,</i>

11:48.529 --> 11:51.697
<i>so our alien is gonna be kind
of like a fat mall cop</i>

11:51.733 --> 11:54.533
<i>with a skirt of tentacles
and membranes.</i>

11:54.568 --> 11:58.537
<i>Cat is working on the face,
and I'm working on the chest.</i>

11:58.572 --> 12:00.572
Can I get a picture for Niko?

12:00.608 --> 12:02.174
Yes...

12:02.210 --> 12:04.042
- Look what I got you.
- Oh, my God.

12:04.077 --> 12:06.278
That's the best.
That's awesome.

12:06.313 --> 12:09.214
It is very funny to see
George's belly as a reference,

12:09.250 --> 12:11.717
but it actually helps a lot,
so thank you, George,

12:11.752 --> 12:13.585
for your beer belly.

12:13.621 --> 12:15.019
- Like it?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:15.055 --> 12:16.521
I'm happy if you're happy!

12:19.926 --> 12:21.425
If you hate it, you can tell me.

12:21.461 --> 12:23.795
If I hate it, I'll tell you.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.731
<i>Our skeleton shrimp looks
a lot like an alien already,</i>

12:26.767 --> 12:28.767
<i>so we're gonna try
and use its body</i>

12:28.802 --> 12:30.701
and create a see-through
character.

12:30.737 --> 12:33.238
I think it's very alien,
which I think is very cool.

12:33.273 --> 12:34.405
Yeah.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.806
Rachael and I switch off
sculpting

12:35.841 --> 12:37.275
<i>the face and cowl.</i>

12:37.310 --> 12:38.376
<i>I'm really good at blocking down</i>

12:38.411 --> 12:39.510
first and secondary forms,

12:39.545 --> 12:41.044
and she's really great
at detail.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.580
<i>So, we play upon our strengths</i>

12:42.615 --> 12:44.382
to try to pull this off.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.751
You can talk to me
like lovers do.

12:48.354 --> 12:50.755
I got him.
Easy!

12:50.790 --> 12:53.390
Ben and I are working on
the giant chest sculpt.

12:53.425 --> 12:55.292
<i>It's a really important
part of the makeup</i>

12:55.327 --> 12:57.828
<i>because we're gonna attach
the giant legs to it.</i>

12:57.863 --> 13:00.230
<i>And our goal for today
is to finish it.</i>

13:00.266 --> 13:01.598
Okay.
Time to rake.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.500
I need to go grab
a couple more sculpting tools,

13:03.535 --> 13:05.269
<i>but as soon as I head
to the mold room...</i>

13:05.304 --> 13:06.236
Whoa!

13:06.272 --> 13:07.470
All: Oh!

13:07.506 --> 13:08.705
- Fuck!
- Oh!

13:08.740 --> 13:11.474
I hear the noise
you never want to hear...

13:11.510 --> 13:13.209
<i>clay hitting the floor.</i>

13:13.244 --> 13:14.411
- Is it bad?
- Oh... yes.

13:14.446 --> 13:16.746
- It fell off completely.
- Damn it!

13:16.782 --> 13:18.214
<i>Everything that I just sculpted</i>

13:18.249 --> 13:20.317
is completely smashed flat.

13:23.087 --> 13:24.387
Oh...

13:24.423 --> 13:26.155
Now we need to start over.

13:26.191 --> 13:28.124
We'll just sculpt him
on the floor then?

13:28.159 --> 13:30.426
- Probably.
- Man down, dude.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.493
Shit

13:31.529 --> 13:33.229
We've lost maybe two hours,

13:33.264 --> 13:35.764
so I'm not giving up,
I just don't want

13:35.800 --> 13:40.102
to get lost doing too much
with so little time.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.343
- Hi, All-Stars!
- Hi!

13:47.378 --> 13:49.712
- Welcome back.
<i>- Mr. Westmore walks in.</i>

13:49.747 --> 13:51.580
<i>Amazing, Oscar-winning
makeup artist,</i>

13:51.615 --> 13:54.516
and I'm super excited
to see him again,

13:54.552 --> 13:57.486
and I can't wait to see
what he has to say

13:57.521 --> 13:58.553
about where we're at.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.655
Tell me, what are you
going to do?

14:00.690 --> 14:02.490
Well, because this is
a faceless creature,

14:02.525 --> 14:04.993
<i>I wanted to try to hide
the mouth as much as possible.</i>

14:05.028 --> 14:07.795
You've gone into the human
form with the cheekbones.

14:07.831 --> 14:09.130
- Mm-hmm.
- And the mouth.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.699
Actually, if you could continue
with this piece here

14:11.735 --> 14:13.368
that would come
all the way to the chin..

14:13.403 --> 14:14.836
- Interesting.
- And then you do away

14:14.871 --> 14:16.537
- with the mouth altogether.
- Sounds good.

14:16.573 --> 14:18.038
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.074
We have fanged octopus.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.109
<i>We're going to remove
the entire body of the octopus,</i>

14:22.144 --> 14:23.944
<i>and it'll be this hovercraft
underneath this</i>

14:23.980 --> 14:26.514
<i>really short, tentacle-y alien.</i>

14:26.549 --> 14:28.549
We were concerned about maybe
taking it too literally

14:28.585 --> 14:29.751
and being too octopus.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.051
I agree with you there.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.053
You don't want to dangle
eight arms

14:33.089 --> 14:34.388
- hanging down from this thing...
- Exactly.

14:34.423 --> 14:36.456
With suckers on it,
but you can do it

14:36.492 --> 14:40.494
by running something up here
that's not human.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.528
Okay.

14:41.563 --> 14:42.796
What we wanted to do was

14:42.831 --> 14:44.899
keep the female gentle-looking.

14:44.934 --> 14:46.466
And even do some beauty makeup.

14:46.502 --> 14:48.935
<i>She uses her bioluminescence
to lure her victims in,</i>

14:48.970 --> 14:50.370
<i>but the rest of her costume</i>

14:50.406 --> 14:52.171
is what's gonna give her
her menacing feel.

14:52.207 --> 14:53.540
You don't want to go so far

14:53.575 --> 14:55.575
as to do a high-fashion makeup.

14:55.611 --> 14:56.710
- Okay.
- By doing that,

14:56.745 --> 14:59.413
your eye would go right to it.

14:59.448 --> 15:01.515
- Okay, okay.
- As opposed to

15:01.550 --> 15:03.850
- looking at the overall head.
- Got it.

15:03.886 --> 15:06.152
- Wow.
- Yeah, we coordinated.

15:06.187 --> 15:07.086
- Yeah.
- Totally.

15:08.756 --> 15:11.657
So, how are you
interpreting your alien?

15:11.692 --> 15:13.559
<i>It's gonna be like
she's multiple entities</i>

15:13.594 --> 15:15.261
<i>- that create one entity.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</i>

15:15.297 --> 15:16.662
I'd do something with the mouth.

15:16.697 --> 15:18.031
- Elongate it, maybe?
- It's... Yeah.

15:18.066 --> 15:19.465
I think so, because, I mean,
right now,

15:19.500 --> 15:21.366
it looks like
it could be a mask.

15:21.402 --> 15:23.402
Like, elongate it...
almost trout-mouth?

15:23.438 --> 15:24.737
Well, you can make it
in between.

15:24.772 --> 15:27.540
- Okay, middle ground.
- Yeah, middle ground with it.

15:27.575 --> 15:29.542
- Good luck to everybody!
all: - Thank you!

15:29.577 --> 15:30.443
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

15:30.478 --> 15:31.844
Take it easy!

15:39.786 --> 15:41.619
That's time, guys!

15:57.370 --> 15:58.570
<i>It's the second day in the lab,</i>

15:58.605 --> 15:59.938
<i>and we've got a lot
of work to do.</i>

15:59.973 --> 16:01.673
We have to finish sculpting
the face and the cowl,

16:01.708 --> 16:04.843
mold it, and we also have to
create our hero piece,

16:04.878 --> 16:07.378
<i>which is our tentacle skirt.</i>

16:07.413 --> 16:09.948
Hopefully, we can get everything
done we need to get done.

16:09.983 --> 16:11.548
I just want to start
fabricating.

16:19.325 --> 16:20.458
Still happy with it
this morning?

16:20.493 --> 16:21.425
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

16:21.461 --> 16:22.526
I think even more so today.

16:22.561 --> 16:24.095
<i>Day two's always crazy,</i>

16:24.130 --> 16:25.829
and I can say that, 'cause
I've been on season ten.

16:25.865 --> 16:27.798
Like...

16:27.833 --> 16:29.366
<i>Our plan of attack is that
we are gonna just</i>

16:29.401 --> 16:31.434
tackle these sculptures
and get 'em molded

16:31.470 --> 16:33.036
as soon as possible.

16:33.071 --> 16:34.872
<i>Since our character is
going to be psychic,</i>

16:34.907 --> 16:37.808
I really want her
to have a big head,

16:37.843 --> 16:40.143
<i>with these sensory orbs
on the side</i>

16:40.178 --> 16:41.812
<i>that reference the eyes
of the fish</i>

16:41.847 --> 16:44.047
but aren't a literal
interpretation.

16:44.082 --> 16:45.548
So what I'm gonna do is
kind of build, um,

16:45.583 --> 16:47.583
the texture on top of that.

16:47.619 --> 16:48.684
- Do you like that?
- Okay, yeah.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.353
And I'll bring that
into here too.

16:50.389 --> 16:52.622
<i>I think that Keaghlan and I are
working really well together</i>

16:52.657 --> 16:54.491
<i>to present a character
that looks like</i>

16:54.526 --> 16:56.459
it was created by one person.

16:56.495 --> 16:57.560
We're all on the same page.

16:57.595 --> 16:59.462
Heck yeah, we are.

17:05.136 --> 17:06.402
<i>While Stella's in the mold room,</i>

17:06.436 --> 17:08.337
<i>I need to start all the plastic</i>

17:08.372 --> 17:10.705
<i>jellyfish bodysuit fabrication.</i>

17:10.742 --> 17:12.441
So I get a sheet of plastic,

17:12.476 --> 17:14.544
and I start heating it
with the heat gun,

17:14.579 --> 17:16.178
<i>and I just really let it
organically</i>

17:16.213 --> 17:19.048
<i>create its own shapes.</i>

17:19.083 --> 17:20.348
<i>We take it over
to the green screen,</i>

17:20.384 --> 17:22.217
and we test out
the puppetry effect

17:22.252 --> 17:23.984
that we're trying to create.

17:24.021 --> 17:27.756
I have no arm!

17:27.790 --> 17:29.324
And it looks really cool!

17:29.360 --> 17:31.360
I don't see the string,
so that works.

17:31.395 --> 17:34.029
Just got to paint that stick.

17:40.704 --> 17:42.403
It's a good thing we wore
our short shorts today.

17:42.439 --> 17:44.005
I know.
I start fabricating

17:44.041 --> 17:45.373
the structure for the body.

17:45.408 --> 17:46.641
I start with a ring,

17:46.677 --> 17:48.276
<i>puzzle-piecing things together</i>

17:48.311 --> 17:49.643
<i>to get the shape I want.</i>

17:49.679 --> 17:51.512
<i>I honestly have
no rhyme or reason.</i>

17:51.548 --> 17:53.414
Most of the body's gonna be
covered with clothes,

17:53.450 --> 17:54.882
<i>so it doesn't have to be
finished or anything.</i>

17:54.917 --> 17:56.284
<i>It just has to have
the correct shape.</i>

17:56.319 --> 17:57.518
It's actually working
pretty well.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.652
It's really funny.

18:02.658 --> 18:05.259
All right, we've got a lot
to do... let's go.

18:12.935 --> 18:14.602
We're going to integrate
green screen technology

18:14.637 --> 18:17.337
into the character
by hiding our model's arms,

18:17.372 --> 18:19.640
<i>having one arm
control four arms.</i>

18:19.675 --> 18:22.509
<i>So, I'm building
the overall form</i>

18:22.544 --> 18:24.978
<i>out of PVC pipe and cups,</i>

18:25.013 --> 18:26.813
<i>and then wrapping it
in Saran wrap,</i>

18:26.848 --> 18:28.582
<i>heating that Saran wrap
down, melting it,</i>

18:28.617 --> 18:30.984
creating a seal
and a mild texture.

18:31.019 --> 18:33.453
That's really cool.

18:33.489 --> 18:34.821
Let me know when
you want to pop that mold,

18:34.856 --> 18:35.788
and I'll help you clean it

18:35.824 --> 18:36.889
so we can get it out of the way.

18:36.925 --> 18:37.924
Yeah, yeah.

18:37.959 --> 18:38.925
Get to it!

18:38.960 --> 18:40.093
Time is going fast,

18:40.128 --> 18:41.661
and I see that it's time

18:41.696 --> 18:43.429
to open our cowl mold.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.767
But I'm noticing
the cowl is not open.

18:49.704 --> 18:52.639
We have to get it open.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.674
I used mold release,
but one side of the cowl

18:54.709 --> 18:56.509
was not completely cured,

18:56.544 --> 18:58.810
so the whole mold
bonded to itself.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.012
We should just forget about it.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.447
Gonna keep going.

19:01.482 --> 19:03.749
This cowl mold is
a very important piece

19:03.784 --> 19:05.884
in our makeup,
so we need to have it.

19:05.919 --> 19:08.754
<i>I'm getting really frustrated.
I'm getting really upset.</i>

19:08.789 --> 19:10.889
At this point,
I don't know what to do.

19:19.195 --> 19:20.529
We should just forget about it.

19:20.565 --> 19:22.798
There's no way
this cowl's opening.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.367
At this point, I want
to stop wasting time

19:25.402 --> 19:27.770
and just go inside and work on
what we do have.

19:27.805 --> 19:29.437
We're gonna keep going.

19:29.473 --> 19:31.807
This cowl mold is
a very important piece

19:31.842 --> 19:34.342
in our makeup,
so we need to have it.

19:34.378 --> 19:36.511
I don't care if we break
the whole front.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.313
- Can I be drastic?
- Yes.

19:38.348 --> 19:41.683
I decide "Let's just
break this mold apart."

19:42.952 --> 19:44.185
- Yes! Yes!
- Ah!

19:44.220 --> 19:45.520
Yes!

19:45.555 --> 19:47.289
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:47.324 --> 19:48.623
Start cleaning.
Start cleaning.

19:48.659 --> 19:51.259
We got it open, but the mold
is just destroyed.

19:51.295 --> 19:52.827
I am just happy it's open.

19:52.862 --> 19:54.496
<i>Thankfully, we still have time</i>

19:54.531 --> 19:55.730
to repair the mold a little bit,

19:55.766 --> 19:57.064
and run it in poly foam,

19:57.100 --> 19:59.967
so I'm just praying
it comes out decent.

20:00.003 --> 20:01.502
I don't know what happened.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.671
- I'm just about done.
- Okay.

20:03.706 --> 20:05.572
<i>Our bodysuit is ready to go,</i>

20:05.608 --> 20:09.143
but I also want to add
really creepy, thin arms.

20:09.179 --> 20:10.444
Oh, that's cool.

20:10.479 --> 20:11.545
I'll melt it with the heat gun,

20:11.580 --> 20:12.913
and it'll give it more form.

20:12.948 --> 20:14.948
So my plan is to take
foam noodles

20:14.983 --> 20:17.117
<i>and then cover them with
liquid latex and tissue</i>

20:17.152 --> 20:20.287
to bring in that texture
that the dragonfish has.

20:20.323 --> 20:21.988
<i>And once we attach it</i>

20:22.024 --> 20:23.857
<i>to the green screen suit,</i>

20:23.892 --> 20:27.728
all you see is these bony,
eerie-looking arms

20:27.763 --> 20:30.197
<i>that no human being would have.</i>

20:31.800 --> 20:33.800
<i>We'd like to give
our creature claws,</i>

20:33.836 --> 20:36.903
<i>just like the ones
the skeleton shrimp have.</i>

20:36.939 --> 20:38.404
<i>And our model will be
wearing green gloves</i>

20:38.440 --> 20:40.373
so that she can hide her hands

20:40.408 --> 20:43.576
while her hands are
inside these claws.

20:43.611 --> 20:45.245
<i>I vacuform them,</i>

20:45.280 --> 20:47.179
<i>and give them together.</i>

20:47.215 --> 20:49.549
The skeleton shrimp
also has veins

20:49.584 --> 20:51.384
that you can see
through his body,

20:51.419 --> 20:54.053
<i>so I attach rope to
the inside of the claw,</i>

20:54.088 --> 20:57.189
hopefully giving the effect
of seeing its insides.

20:57.225 --> 20:59.792
Yeah, look it, 'cause then
you can still see this.

20:59.828 --> 21:01.794
<i>The closer I get
to finishing it up,</i>

21:01.830 --> 21:04.496
the more excited I am to see
this really come together.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.530
That looks good.

21:07.335 --> 21:08.800
Oh, yeah.
Look at that, dude.

21:08.836 --> 21:10.669
- Boom!
- Oh, easy.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.239
<i>Instead of having eight giant
legs for our spider crab,</i>

21:13.274 --> 21:16.008
I think it's gonna be easier
to do two bigger legs,

21:16.043 --> 21:18.643
<i>so I build a wood armature,</i>

21:18.679 --> 21:21.145
<i>then I wrap that
with upholstery foam</i>

21:21.181 --> 21:23.181
<i>to get as much bulk as possible.</i>

21:23.216 --> 21:26.084
<i>And then, I cover it in L200</i>

21:26.119 --> 21:27.686
and seal it with warm give.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.489
I'm sure you are.

21:30.524 --> 21:31.690
I'm gonna do the best I can,

21:31.725 --> 21:33.492
but having to make
two giant legs...

21:33.527 --> 21:37.561
it looks like we're not gonna
get everything done today.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.863
Can I get a time check?

21:38.899 --> 21:40.831
- 18 minutes.
- Copy.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.905
That's time, everybody!

21:46.940 --> 21:48.806
Whoo!

21:53.947 --> 21:56.414
Things didn't go as quickly
as we need it to.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.282
<i>Not having these two
legs finished...</i>

21:58.317 --> 21:59.850
it's not setting us up
for success

21:59.886 --> 22:02.420
for application day.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.561
Guys, it's application day,

22:11.596 --> 22:12.796
and we get four hours
in the lab!

22:12.831 --> 22:15.432
Aw, yeah.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.800
- Whoo!
- Oh, my goodness.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.835
- Hi.
- Hi, it's good to see you.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.971
- So good to see you, man.
- Good to see you!

22:21.006 --> 22:22.306
You're probably the first makeup

22:22.341 --> 22:23.840
ever in Face Off history

22:23.875 --> 22:25.742
- to completely disappear.
- To be totally translucent.

22:25.777 --> 22:28.477
So our plan is to paint
these shrimp-like panelings

22:28.512 --> 22:30.546
<i>up the front and back
of our model green,</i>

22:30.581 --> 22:31.814
<i>and the green is gonna disappear</i>

22:31.849 --> 22:33.816
once its against
the green screen.

22:33.851 --> 22:35.318
<i>Rachael and I
are both really nervous</i>

22:35.353 --> 22:36.552
<i>because we want this to pay off.</i>

22:36.587 --> 22:37.920
This is a big risk.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.422
<i>If they don't disappear,</i>

22:39.457 --> 22:41.123
then everything's
not gonna make sense.

22:41.159 --> 22:44.093
Oh, my God.
That is so awesome.

22:45.529 --> 22:48.664
- Okay.
- Let's try to get this on you.

22:49.867 --> 22:51.800
While Adam finishes the arms,

22:51.836 --> 22:53.702
<i>I start trimming the face
to make sure</i>

22:53.737 --> 22:55.403
<i>that not only can the model see,</i>

22:55.439 --> 22:57.539
<i>but that the judges
don't see eyes,</i>

22:57.575 --> 22:59.475
because these holes
are quite big.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.943
It's obvious, bro.

23:00.978 --> 23:02.010
You can put a piece of mesh.

23:02.045 --> 23:03.644
Luckily, it's an easy fix.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.546
I take some scrim cloth,
I cut out

23:05.582 --> 23:07.248
<i>some circles and give them in,</i>

23:07.284 --> 23:09.050
<i>then they can be painted dark,</i>

23:09.086 --> 23:11.519
so when the model
dons the face piece,

23:11.554 --> 23:14.956
<i>they can see, but the judges
can't see their eyes.</i>

23:21.798 --> 23:23.998
Evan and I have
way too much work to do.

23:24.033 --> 23:25.566
<i>I finish surfacing the legs,</i>

23:25.602 --> 23:27.301
<i>they're handed off to Evan</i>

23:27.336 --> 23:29.003
<i>so he can start
painting them with latex,</i>

23:29.038 --> 23:30.905
and then I start building
the back shell.

23:33.442 --> 23:34.875
Okay.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.910
We've bit off a little bit
more than we could chew.

23:36.945 --> 23:38.145
<i>But I've seen more stuff
come together</i>

23:38.180 --> 23:39.713
<i>in one our of Last Looks</i>

23:39.748 --> 23:42.082
than I have in three days
of a Spotlight Challenge,

23:42.118 --> 23:45.719
so anything can happen.

23:48.824 --> 23:51.090
We're gonna do
a killer paint job on this.

23:51.126 --> 23:52.258
<i>We're gonna paint the whole head</i>

23:52.293 --> 23:53.760
<i>the same kind of reddish color</i>

23:53.795 --> 23:55.695
<i>as the helmet jellyfish.</i>

23:55.731 --> 23:58.164
<i>Luckily, we only have
to focus on that,</i>

23:58.199 --> 24:00.734
because the chest down
and the arms

24:00.769 --> 24:02.602
are all gonna be
green-screened out.

24:02.638 --> 24:04.037
<i>We go in with the airbrush</i>

24:04.072 --> 24:05.972
<i>and we stick in other colors</i>

24:06.008 --> 24:08.307
to really bring out the shadows
of the forms.

24:08.343 --> 24:10.009
- She looks badass.
- Yeah.

24:10.045 --> 24:11.477
Okay.

24:16.484 --> 24:18.684
I'm digging it... I'm digging it
so much already.

24:18.719 --> 24:21.320
The paint job is so important
to this makeup.

24:21.356 --> 24:23.923
<i>Our fish has this amazing
leopard patterning</i>

24:23.958 --> 24:25.724
<i>that we really want
to incorporate,</i>

24:25.760 --> 24:27.359
but I don't want it
to be so busy

24:27.394 --> 24:29.562
that we lose focus, so I'm using

24:29.597 --> 24:31.396
the patterning as highlights.

24:31.432 --> 24:33.599
After you've done this,
circle it in white.

24:33.634 --> 24:34.633
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:34.669 --> 24:35.768
It's gonna be really cool

24:35.803 --> 24:37.736
when it's all put together.

24:37.772 --> 24:39.538
- I like it.
- Cool.

24:42.943 --> 24:44.109
Cat is working on
the application

24:44.144 --> 24:45.777
while I'm fabricating.

24:45.812 --> 24:47.212
Having this problem
with the cowl yesterday,

24:47.247 --> 24:49.013
it put us a little bit behind,

24:49.049 --> 24:50.748
<i>so by doing fabrication today,</i>

24:50.784 --> 24:53.651
it's gonna cut time
in our painting.

24:53.687 --> 24:54.919
<i>We want to make sure
that we at least</i>

24:54.955 --> 24:56.421
<i>have all the pieces applied</i>

24:56.457 --> 24:58.723
<i>and finish all the fabrication.</i>

24:58.758 --> 25:00.191
- Face it up kind of...
- Okay.

25:00.226 --> 25:02.393
- Further up like that.
<i>- It makes me nervous,</i>

25:02.428 --> 25:04.161
but we have to just get it done.

25:04.197 --> 25:05.396
Glue in these.
Glue in the front ones.

25:05.431 --> 25:06.965
Yeah, yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.766
Ten minutes!

25:15.174 --> 25:17.508
Guys, it's time!

25:17.543 --> 25:18.675
Just got a lot
of painting to do.

25:18.711 --> 25:20.244
Four hours are done.

25:20.279 --> 25:22.113
<i>We just have a base coat
on our creature.</i>

25:22.148 --> 25:24.115
And we don't have
anything else painted.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.983
<i>I still need
to secure the tentacles,</i>

25:26.018 --> 25:27.718
<i>we need to paint
this whole creature,</i>

25:27.753 --> 25:29.253
<i>we need to paint the skirt,</i>

25:29.288 --> 25:31.855
so I really don't know if this
is gonna happen.

25:39.001 --> 25:40.668
This is it.

25:40.704 --> 25:42.103
<i>Last Looks is always terrifying,</i>

25:42.138 --> 25:43.370
<i>and we still have a lot to do.</i>

25:43.406 --> 25:45.006
We have one hour,
and Keaghlan starts

25:45.041 --> 25:46.975
by finishing the paint job
on the face.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.576
Get the chest on... We need
to make that a priority.

25:48.612 --> 25:50.311
<i>I start sewing the chest piece</i>

25:50.346 --> 25:53.247
onto the green suit.

25:53.282 --> 25:55.149
- How far are you?
- Yeah, I'm almost there.

25:55.184 --> 25:57.184
We've got so much to do...
I have to concentrate

25:57.220 --> 25:58.819
<i>on painting our entire creature,</i>

25:58.854 --> 26:00.988
<i>while Niko finishes
green-screening the arms,</i>

26:01.023 --> 26:03.157
putting all the tentacles in,
and painting the skirt.

26:03.192 --> 26:04.525
All right, Niko, do the eyes.
Eyes, eyes, eyes.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.160
- I need them to stand up.
- Eyes, eyes, eyes.

26:06.195 --> 26:07.461
We're just gonna
have to latex it.

26:07.497 --> 26:09.529
We try the suit on the model,

26:09.564 --> 26:11.665
<i>and there's a big gap between
the face and the body,</i>

26:11.700 --> 26:13.767
<i>so we have to make
some last-minute skin.</i>

26:13.802 --> 26:15.168
<i>So, I start gluing
the cling wrap down,</i>

26:15.203 --> 26:19.740
creating the skin bridge between
the head and the back.

26:19.775 --> 26:21.008
Let's get this guy strapped up.

26:21.043 --> 26:23.844
We have five days of work
in Last Looks.

26:23.879 --> 26:25.711
<i>We still have to paint
the third leg,</i>

26:25.747 --> 26:28.548
<i>put the pinchers on,
get the legs attached...</i>

26:28.583 --> 26:29.782
basically, we have to do
everything.

26:29.817 --> 26:31.551
Shit, we need to give this in.

26:31.586 --> 26:33.453
15 minutes!

26:41.496 --> 26:43.329
All right, everybody.
That's time!

26:43.365 --> 26:44.464
Man.

26:44.499 --> 26:46.031
<i>I guess it's finished.</i>

26:46.067 --> 26:47.633
We're All-Stars,
and we're here

26:47.669 --> 26:49.001
to show the best work,
and to start off

26:49.036 --> 26:51.036
<i>with something that's sub-par</i>

26:51.072 --> 26:53.806
just... sucks.

27:03.918 --> 27:06.451
Welcome back to
the Face Off reveal stage.

27:06.487 --> 27:07.853
Thank you.

27:07.889 --> 27:09.554
Well, you all know
our incredibly

27:09.590 --> 27:11.556
talented series judges.

27:11.592 --> 27:13.359
Owner of Alchemy Studios,

27:13.394 --> 27:14.760
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

27:14.795 --> 27:16.294
Good evening.

27:16.329 --> 27:19.130
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist

27:19.165 --> 27:21.065
- Ms. Ve Neill.
- Thank you.

27:21.101 --> 27:22.967
What a fabulous déjà vu.

27:23.003 --> 27:24.403
Welcome back.

27:24.438 --> 27:26.405
And of course, creature
and concept designer

27:26.440 --> 27:28.774
Mr. Neville Page.

27:28.809 --> 27:32.643
So good to see
so many familiar faces.

27:32.678 --> 27:34.279
Before we get started,
I want to remind you

27:34.314 --> 27:36.414
that tonight's top team

27:36.449 --> 27:38.549
will win immunity
and will be safe

27:38.584 --> 27:41.685
from elimination in next week's
Spotlight Challenge.

27:41.721 --> 27:42.787
All right, guys.

27:42.822 --> 27:45.223
For your first
Spotlight Challenge,

27:45.258 --> 27:47.324
we asked you to choose
a deep-sea creature

27:47.359 --> 27:49.527
to inspire a unique alien.

27:49.562 --> 27:51.995
And, in a Face Off first,

27:52.031 --> 27:54.732
we provided you
with green screen technology

27:54.767 --> 27:57.267
to enhance your creations.

27:57.303 --> 28:00.538
So, let's take a look at your
digitally-altered aliens.

28:00.573 --> 28:02.005
Emily and Tyler,
you're up first.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.761
<i>The silhouette is so creepy.</i>

28:24.796 --> 28:27.664
Emily and I really feel
we nailed the character.

28:48.252 --> 28:49.418
<i>Evan and I are feeling lucky</i>

28:49.454 --> 28:52.154
<i>that it's not an
elimination challenge.</i>

28:52.190 --> 28:54.823
We're sure we're
in Bottom Looks.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.746
<i>I think that we worked
really well together,</i>

29:18.781 --> 29:20.482
<i>and we've created a creature</i>

29:20.517 --> 29:23.551
that's nothing like anything
I've ever seen before.

29:44.806 --> 29:47.040
<i>I can't help but laugh at it.</i>

29:47.075 --> 29:49.308
<i>Generally, you don't want
people to laugh at your work,</i>

29:49.344 --> 29:51.044
but in this case, that was

29:51.079 --> 29:53.146
the reaction we're going for.

30:15.069 --> 30:17.335
<i>While she is really beautiful,</i>

30:17.371 --> 30:19.738
<i>she's also cutting
into her tentacles</i>

30:19.774 --> 30:22.040
<i>with her hand,
and they're disappearing.</i>

30:22.076 --> 30:25.544
I'm hoping that maybe the judges
will just overlook it.

30:46.967 --> 30:49.433
<i>She looks great.
I think she's really dynamic.</i>

30:49.469 --> 30:52.336
<i>Gage and I wish we had done
a little bit more detail,</i>

30:52.371 --> 30:53.972
but with the time we were given,

30:54.007 --> 30:56.240
we think we achieved a lot.

31:16.361 --> 31:17.894
<i>Some people went
really abstract,</i>

31:17.930 --> 31:19.462
<i>some people went very literal,</i>

31:19.498 --> 31:21.732
<i>and we're kind of in the middle.</i>

31:21.767 --> 31:24.935
I am just hoping we stack up.

31:45.757 --> 31:47.489
<i>It looks so amazing
on green screen.</i>

31:47.525 --> 31:50.059
<i>I'm really proud of what Niko
and I were able to accomplish.</i>

31:50.094 --> 31:52.227
Especially with all
the trouble we had.

31:56.668 --> 31:58.433
All right, judges,
why don't you go ahead

31:58.469 --> 32:02.171
and take a closer look at
these imaginative aliens?

32:05.376 --> 32:06.741
Look at you.

32:06.777 --> 32:07.842
I think they did a lot of work.

32:07.878 --> 32:09.511
They've even painted her legs.

32:09.547 --> 32:11.346
I love the paint job
on these hands.

32:11.382 --> 32:14.082
It's gorgeous close up.

32:15.319 --> 32:16.885
He looks like
a Mexican wrestler.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.386
I kind of see it now.

32:18.421 --> 32:20.755
I love the idea of this,

32:20.791 --> 32:22.023
but it's the proportion.

32:22.059 --> 32:23.825
It destroys all attempts

32:23.860 --> 32:26.494
at doing something cool.

32:26.529 --> 32:27.996
What a cool head shape, huh?

32:28.031 --> 32:28.930
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.431
Just gorgeous.

32:30.466 --> 32:32.433
It's one of the finest
paint jobs I've seen

32:32.468 --> 32:33.934
in terms of patterning

32:33.969 --> 32:37.371
and graphic design.

32:37.407 --> 32:39.940
- Face, obviously super cool.
- Yeah.

32:39.975 --> 32:42.109
The way that this comes out
over the eyes is awesome.

32:42.144 --> 32:44.912
It's really fun.

32:44.947 --> 32:47.381
Definitely took advantage
of the green on this one.

32:47.417 --> 32:48.816
Yeah, yeah, I think
this is probably

32:48.851 --> 32:50.684
the best use of
the green screen.

32:50.720 --> 32:54.121
That's what
the challenge is about.

32:54.156 --> 32:56.023
Ooh, this fabricating is rough.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.658
The shapes are just
heavy-handed and clumsy.

32:58.694 --> 33:00.060
I wish that the arms
were underneath,

33:00.096 --> 33:02.462
so that they're not covering
everything up here.

33:02.497 --> 33:05.899
Crosses a lot
when you see it on the green.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.235
Nice paint job.

33:08.270 --> 33:09.802
Look at all these little plates.

33:09.838 --> 33:11.238
It's really cool.

33:11.273 --> 33:13.740
I like the idea
of bifurcating the forearm,

33:13.775 --> 33:16.443
but it just terminates
in such an abrupt way

33:16.478 --> 33:19.812
that it feels very incomplete.

33:21.550 --> 33:23.582
Look at the paint on this.

33:23.618 --> 33:25.952
That is absolutely gorgeous.

33:25.987 --> 33:29.521
But I feel that it failed
in the design department.

33:29.557 --> 33:32.424
Yeah.

33:35.630 --> 33:37.897
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.765
Let's find out
what they thought.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.100
Rachael and Gage.

33:42.136 --> 33:44.703
Ben and Evan.

33:44.739 --> 33:47.205
Jasmine and Stella.

33:47.241 --> 33:51.076
Keaghlan and Melissa.

33:51.111 --> 33:53.646
You are the best
and the worst this week,

33:53.681 --> 33:54.980
and the judges would like

33:55.015 --> 33:56.281
to speak with you
about your work.

33:56.316 --> 33:57.615
That means the rest of you

33:57.651 --> 33:59.184
can head back
to the makeup room.

33:59.219 --> 34:00.618
Thanks.

34:04.624 --> 34:05.991
Ben and Evan.

34:06.026 --> 34:08.626
Please step up.

34:08.661 --> 34:10.829
<i>Going up in front of
the judges with this makeup</i>

34:10.864 --> 34:13.697
<i>right off the bat makes me
second-guess myself.</i>

34:13.733 --> 34:15.433
This doesn't look good.

34:18.469 --> 34:19.404
Ben and Evan.

34:19.438 --> 34:21.105
Please step up.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.510
Guys, tell me about

34:26.545 --> 34:28.478
how you approached
this challenge.

34:28.514 --> 34:31.481
Our initial idea was to
get rid of the human form

34:31.516 --> 34:34.752
and have giant arms
to propel this thing.

34:34.786 --> 34:36.353
Yeah, we didn't want
to burden ourselves

34:36.388 --> 34:38.255
with too many legs.

34:38.290 --> 34:40.123
I dig the head,
but when you decided

34:40.158 --> 34:42.359
not to pursue the multiple legs,

34:42.393 --> 34:44.127
you made a mistake.

34:46.130 --> 34:47.563
I think it certainly
would have been

34:47.600 --> 34:49.833
more efficacious in
representing your creature,

34:49.868 --> 34:51.768
especially in
a green screen challenge,

34:51.803 --> 34:54.938
to have pursued
that multiple leg concept,

34:54.973 --> 34:56.371
and I know that
you're definitely better

34:56.407 --> 34:58.274
than what you presented
here tonight.

34:58.309 --> 34:59.642
Dudes, I don't know

34:59.677 --> 35:02.145
what the hell
you were thinking of.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.948
These giant legs look
like totem poles

35:04.983 --> 35:06.783
that were painted by
a bunch of three-year-olds.

35:08.186 --> 35:10.653
The potential
of the silhouette of this

35:10.688 --> 35:12.221
is cool.

35:12.257 --> 35:14.022
But I say the potential, 'cause

35:14.058 --> 35:16.158
the disconnect between
head and body,

35:16.193 --> 35:18.461
they are of two separate worlds,

35:18.496 --> 35:22.331
so this one's very
bittersweet for me.

35:22.367 --> 35:23.733
Ben and Evan.

35:23.768 --> 35:24.800
Can you please head back?

35:24.835 --> 35:26.636
Yeah.
Thank you.

35:29.573 --> 35:31.039
Next time.

35:31.075 --> 35:32.808
Rachael and Gage?

35:38.515 --> 35:39.381
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

35:39.416 --> 35:40.382
Hi, Ve.

35:40.417 --> 35:41.349
Tell us about your

35:41.385 --> 35:43.152
skeleton shrimp alien, please.

35:43.187 --> 35:45.987
She's from a water planet.

35:46.022 --> 35:48.990
She is transparent
and bioluminescent.

35:49.025 --> 35:50.659
I think you did
a really good job

35:50.694 --> 35:52.627
utilizing the green screen
element for this.

35:54.731 --> 35:56.765
This is really clever,
what you worked out.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.400
- Thank you.
- I mean, she is basically

35:58.435 --> 36:00.201
<i>see-through,
which is really cool.</i>

36:00.236 --> 36:01.502
<i>- Yeah.
- I particularly love</i>

36:01.537 --> 36:03.171
<i>these claw hands...
they look really</i>

36:03.206 --> 36:05.306
<i>spectacular
on the screen as well.</i>

36:05.341 --> 36:07.140
- Great job, guys.
- Oh, thank you so much.

36:08.376 --> 36:10.610
The claws are my favorite thing

36:10.645 --> 36:13.980
because not only are they just
great the way they look,

36:14.016 --> 36:16.649
but that one simple cord
was enough

36:16.685 --> 36:19.485
to express an internal
nerve system,

36:19.521 --> 36:21.221
so some very smart thinking,

36:21.256 --> 36:23.723
and some of the most
successful effect.

36:23.758 --> 36:25.024
Thank you very much.

36:25.059 --> 36:26.492
Some of the sculpting's
a little rough,

36:26.528 --> 36:28.428
and that would be problematic
in another challenge.

36:28.463 --> 36:31.063
In this challenge, it's exactly
what you needed to do,

36:31.098 --> 36:32.932
because you're trying to create
all these shapes

36:32.967 --> 36:34.534
and get a full-body look.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.135
This is what
we expect out of vets.

36:36.170 --> 36:38.738
You can make some of these
more complex decisions

36:38.773 --> 36:40.306
and you did that wonderfully.

36:40.341 --> 36:41.573
- Thank you very much, Glenn.
- Thanks.

36:41.608 --> 36:44.343
Rachael and Gage,
you can step back.

36:49.616 --> 36:52.318
Stella and Jasmine.
Please come forward.

36:59.025 --> 37:00.425
- Hello.
- Hi.

37:00.461 --> 37:01.626
So tell us about your alien

37:01.662 --> 37:04.195
that's inspired
by the helmet jellyfish.

37:04.231 --> 37:07.131
We looked at it as having
that really great opportunity

37:07.167 --> 37:09.501
to use the green screen
to remove the legs

37:09.536 --> 37:11.570
and then go from there.

37:11.605 --> 37:15.840
The proportion is totally off.

37:15.876 --> 37:17.675
When shaping stuff
and doing things

37:17.710 --> 37:19.844
in a beautiful and elegant way,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.046
you have to step back
and look at

37:22.082 --> 37:24.883
the balance of thin to thick.

37:24.918 --> 37:26.918
And right now,
that cheekbone, for example,

37:26.953 --> 37:29.119
is one solid pipe,

37:29.154 --> 37:31.154
and it makes the whole thing
feel less elegant

37:31.190 --> 37:32.490
than I think you're capable of.

37:32.525 --> 37:33.591
Okay.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.158
I feel like the arms,

37:35.194 --> 37:36.494
and their positioning,

37:36.529 --> 37:38.028
is a massive problem.

37:38.063 --> 37:40.197
<i>The arm crosses constantly,</i>

37:40.232 --> 37:41.699
<i>so when you see it onscreen,</i>

37:41.734 --> 37:43.601
<i>it's crossing elements
that are meant</i>

37:43.636 --> 37:45.468
<i>to be present in the composite</i>

37:45.504 --> 37:47.104
<i>while the performer's arms
underneath</i>

37:47.139 --> 37:49.572
are supposed to be invisible.

37:49.608 --> 37:51.074
You could solve
a lot of your problems

37:51.110 --> 37:53.710
by getting the performer's
arms underneath

37:53.745 --> 37:55.845
and running a few rods below.

37:55.881 --> 37:58.815
That way,
when they were gesticulating,

37:58.850 --> 38:01.318
<i>the performer's arms
would have remained hidden,</i>

38:01.353 --> 38:03.019
<i>and it would look like
they were invisible.</i>

38:03.054 --> 38:04.921
Right.

38:04.956 --> 38:06.689
Stella and Jasmine,
if you'd please head back.

38:06.725 --> 38:08.991
Thank you.

38:13.732 --> 38:15.832
Keaghlan and Melissa.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.672
Hi, guys.

38:23.707 --> 38:24.941
- Hello.
- Hey.

38:24.976 --> 38:26.375
Start by telling me
about the concept.

38:26.411 --> 38:29.345
Our creature is supposed to be
an evolved alien.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.814
She is composed of many beings,

38:31.849 --> 38:35.016
and the smaller pieces
on her arms are drones.

38:35.052 --> 38:36.652
Love the head.

38:36.687 --> 38:38.687
Thank you.

38:38.722 --> 38:40.388
It is stunning.

38:40.424 --> 38:42.123
Then you accentuated
the whole thing

38:42.159 --> 38:43.826
with an amazing array

38:43.861 --> 38:46.328
of different
skills and techniques.

38:46.363 --> 38:47.362
Both: Thank you.

38:47.397 --> 38:48.697
So bitchin'.

38:48.732 --> 38:49.898
She really looks cool.

38:49.934 --> 38:51.399
I love the glowing membrane.

38:51.435 --> 38:52.800
Really nicely done.

38:52.836 --> 38:54.035
Both: Thank you.

38:54.071 --> 38:56.304
The graphic design,
the break-up,

38:56.340 --> 38:59.274
the texturing,
and the palette are exquisite.

38:59.309 --> 39:00.976
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

39:01.011 --> 39:03.544
Keaghlan and Melissa,
you can step back.

39:08.384 --> 39:09.283
- Good job.
- Yeah!

39:09.318 --> 39:10.685
Thanks, guys.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.919
If you'll please head
back to the makeup room

39:11.955 --> 39:13.788
while the judges deliberate.

39:20.763 --> 39:22.096
All right, let's start
with your favorites.

39:22.131 --> 39:24.465
How about Rachael and Gage?

39:24.500 --> 39:26.700
<i>I loved that one.
You just saw right through it.</i>

39:26.735 --> 39:29.103
<i>It was probably
the best use of green screen.</i>

39:29.138 --> 39:31.105
I agree,
particularly in the claws.

39:31.140 --> 39:33.673
And that little detail of
just putting one cord

39:33.709 --> 39:37.044
through it to indicate
an internal nerve system,

39:37.079 --> 39:39.613
I thought was such
a smart detail.

39:39.648 --> 39:43.316
Unbelievable how
it all separated out perfectly.

39:43.351 --> 39:45.018
<i>You even saw
the bones in the neck.</i>

39:45.053 --> 39:47.587
All right, let's talk about
Keaghlan and Melissa.

39:47.623 --> 39:50.590
<i>It's great to see such
intelligence behind a concept</i>

39:50.626 --> 39:53.059
<i>that was very exciting,
and really beautiful.</i>

39:53.094 --> 39:55.729
The head is utterly gorgeous.

39:55.764 --> 39:58.531
<i>We often say, "Lights weren't
the best use of time."</i>

39:58.566 --> 40:00.400
<i>This was a perfect example
of when</i>

40:00.435 --> 40:02.601
<i>it was a very good use of time.</i>

40:02.637 --> 40:04.803
That said alien,
'cause you really thought

40:04.839 --> 40:07.206
there was some sort of
ethereal-type thing

40:07.242 --> 40:10.276
floating around in there,
and it was really quite cool.

40:10.311 --> 40:11.444
All right, let's move on
to the looks

40:11.479 --> 40:13.246
that didn't quite work for you.

40:13.281 --> 40:15.347
Why don't we start
with Ben and Evan?

40:15.382 --> 40:16.749
<i>Not even a side of garlic butter</i>

40:16.784 --> 40:18.216
<i>would make this better.</i>

40:19.286 --> 40:20.553
I don't know how they could have

40:20.588 --> 40:22.755
let it go that far
off the rails.

40:22.790 --> 40:25.591
The head is okay, but the arms,

40:25.626 --> 40:27.726
<i>and the dragging appendage</i>

40:27.762 --> 40:29.028
<i>hanging off the back of it?</i>

40:29.063 --> 40:30.395
<i>It's just ridiculous.</i>

40:30.431 --> 40:31.763
Well, maybe it just went south

40:31.798 --> 40:33.031
when they started painting it

40:33.067 --> 40:34.199
and didn't realize
how goofy it was

40:34.234 --> 40:35.434
till it was too late.

40:35.469 --> 40:36.868
I think they both know
what they did,

40:36.903 --> 40:38.703
and next week
they have no choice

40:38.738 --> 40:40.605
but to really turn it on.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.641
All right, let's move on
to Stella and Jasmine.

40:43.677 --> 40:45.110
<i>I think they had
a pretty good idea.</i>

40:45.145 --> 40:47.411
<i>I just don't think it was
quite cohesive enough.</i>

40:47.447 --> 40:49.480
<i>There was the white, the clear,
the legs,</i>

40:49.515 --> 40:51.382
<i>and then that big red head</i>

40:51.417 --> 40:52.784
<i>sticking out of all of it.</i>

40:52.819 --> 40:54.886
The net result was a human head

40:54.921 --> 40:57.321
floating in a discongruous mass

40:57.356 --> 41:00.058
of poorly-fabricated tentacles.

41:00.093 --> 41:03.061
The arm crossing it and
disappearing it constantly

41:03.096 --> 41:05.563
<i>was a massive problem,
and it's just</i>

41:05.598 --> 41:07.498
<i>a part of the challenge
that was too complex for them.</i>

41:07.533 --> 41:08.865
All right, judges,
have you chosen

41:08.901 --> 41:10.434
tonight's winner, then?

41:10.470 --> 41:11.402
Yeah, we have.

41:11.437 --> 41:13.471
Let's bring 'em back out.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.742
All right, Glenn.
Tell us about the top teams.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.443
Keaghlan and Melissa.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.779
We loved your inventive,
artistic head sculpture,

41:22.815 --> 41:24.615
and your high-concept thinking's

41:24.650 --> 41:26.683
absolutely welcome here
this season.

41:26.719 --> 41:28.184
Rachael and Gage,

41:28.220 --> 41:30.687
your use of green screen
was just stellar,

41:30.723 --> 41:32.155
and those
semi-translucent hands

41:32.190 --> 41:34.825
were a particularly
standout element.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.693
All right, Glenn.
Who is our winning team?

41:37.729 --> 41:39.529
The winning team tonight is...

41:47.660 --> 41:49.094
All right, Glenn.
Who is our winning team?

41:49.129 --> 41:51.096
The winning team tonight is...

41:54.435 --> 41:56.133
Keaghlan and Melissa.

41:57.671 --> 42:00.004
We loved the incredible head
of your character design,

42:00.040 --> 42:02.339
and the overall image
of your floating alien.

42:02.375 --> 42:04.241
In concert with
the background that you chose,

42:04.277 --> 42:06.143
it was very successful.

42:06.179 --> 42:07.278
Congratulations.

42:07.313 --> 42:08.512
Both: Thank you.

42:09.916 --> 42:12.483
Having a teammate,
and winning with a teammate,

42:12.518 --> 42:13.584
<i>is crazy cool.</i>

42:13.619 --> 42:14.785
You know, it feels
out of this world,

42:14.820 --> 42:16.053
and, you know, it's... if...

42:16.089 --> 42:18.254
- Literally.
- Literally out of this world!

42:18.290 --> 42:20.390
Keaghlan and Melissa,
congratulations.

42:20.425 --> 42:22.559
As winners of
tonight's challenge,

42:22.594 --> 42:24.294
your team has won immunity

42:24.329 --> 42:26.629
in next week's
Spotlight Challenge.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.599
All right, well,
for those of you

42:29.634 --> 42:31.067
on the bottom tonight,

42:31.103 --> 42:32.969
you will have a chance
to redeem yourselves next week,

42:33.004 --> 42:35.370
so make sure to step it up.

42:35.406 --> 42:36.472
All right, everyone.

42:36.507 --> 42:38.574
You can all head home
and get some rest.

42:38.610 --> 42:39.875
- Good night.
all: - Good night.

42:39.911 --> 42:41.143
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

42:41.178 --> 42:42.912
<i>Being a Bottom Look
in the first challenge</i>

42:42.947 --> 42:45.547
is a terrible feeling,
and I feel like

42:45.583 --> 42:48.618
we've just really jeopardized
our second chance.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.385
<i>So, whatever the next
challenge is,</i>

42:50.421 --> 42:52.121
Ben and I
have to make a comeback.

42:52.283 --> 42:53.371

<i>Next time on Face Off...</i>

42:55.383 --> 42:56.828
We are going to ask you
to do something

42:56.863 --> 42:59.031
that has never been done before.

43:00.557 --> 43:01.785
This wasn't really to work out.

43:01.786 --> 43:03.067
Ooh, it did not set.

43:03.068 --> 43:04.626
I have no fight left in me.

43:04.627 --> 43:06.296
Two of you will be
going home tonight.
