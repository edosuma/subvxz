02:14.882 --> 02:18.427
Open the door, you stupid motherfucker!
Open the fuckin' door!

02:23.098 --> 02:24.850
I had the fuckin' keys, Stan!

02:24.933 --> 02:26.519
This is faster.

02:26.895 --> 02:28.271
I need it.

02:28.646 --> 02:30.190
Relax, you'll get it.

02:30.315 --> 02:31.649
I need it so bad.

02:31.733 --> 02:33.902
Get the fuckin' door, Johnny!

02:34.277 --> 02:35.320
Come on!

02:44.037 --> 02:46.707
No! Honey, don't you dare go down there!

02:46.916 --> 02:49.752
Yes, it's Osman's Drug at 7th and Burdoch.

02:52.838 --> 02:56.133
What the fuck! I thought you knew
where the good stuff was!

02:56.217 --> 02:58.385
He always keeps it right in here!

03:01.430 --> 03:02.306
Shit!

03:04.016 --> 03:05.434
I'm gonna count to three.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.603
Or?

03:07.729 --> 03:11.024
Or my wife will be mopping up your blood
tomorrow morning.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.526
Yeah, Pops?

03:12.776 --> 03:16.071
You'd shoot your little boy?
With that big gun...

03:16.696 --> 03:19.616
...you'd shoot and kill little Johnny D.?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.668
You ain't gonna shoot your little boy!

03:28.751 --> 03:31.087
- Shut up!
- You shut the fuck up!

03:31.170 --> 03:33.548
And help Johnny D. Find the good shit!

03:34.465 --> 03:35.383
Cops!

03:35.466 --> 03:36.843
No, don't!

03:40.805 --> 03:42.181
No, don't!

03:42.473 --> 03:43.933
I live here!

03:50.524 --> 03:52.359
Do you want to fuck around?

04:12.464 --> 04:14.299
Come on, you motherfucker!

04:14.382 --> 04:17.177
You want to play with me? Let's do it!

05:06.895 --> 05:08.396
Did you find any?

05:08.897 --> 05:09.898
What?

05:26.707 --> 05:28.042
Let's go.

05:29.293 --> 05:30.378
Come on!

05:37.094 --> 05:38.262
Sit down!

05:39.513 --> 05:41.598
Sit down, you ugly bitch!

05:43.767 --> 05:45.436
Put her in the chair.

05:49.606 --> 05:51.860
You're not only ugly, you're stupid, too.

05:51.943 --> 05:54.946
Get smart with me
and I'll rip your face off!

05:55.905 --> 05:57.198
Now then...

05:58.324 --> 06:00.034
...what's your name?

06:00.201 --> 06:01.911
- Maggie.
- Full name.

06:03.455 --> 06:04.706
Blowjob.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.416
Maggie Blowjob.

06:20.806 --> 06:22.683
Go ahead. Grin away.

06:23.559 --> 06:27.062
We'll put you on Death Row,
you'll lose that grin real quick.

06:27.646 --> 06:28.731
Here.

06:28.939 --> 06:32.318
Sign that. I don't have any more time
for your bullshit.

06:37.991 --> 06:39.493
Can I have a pencil?

07:00.348 --> 07:02.934
<i>Having been found guilty
of the crime of murder...</i>

07:03.017 --> 07:07.855
<i>... it is the judgment of this court that
you be sentenced to die by lethal injection.</i>

07:08.564 --> 07:11.734
<i>You are hereby remanded
to the federal prison in Pleasanton...</i>

07:11.818 --> 07:15.322
<i>... where you shall remain
until your sentence is carried out.</i>

07:15.989 --> 07:18.200
<i>And may God have mercy on your soul.</i>

07:21.912 --> 07:23.288
Motherfuckers!

07:53.403 --> 07:54.696
No... no!

07:56.532 --> 07:58.534
Please wait for my mom!

08:00.077 --> 08:03.164
Wait, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

08:04.832 --> 08:06.917
Wait till my mommy comes!

08:09.336 --> 08:10.838
Wait for her!

08:13.340 --> 08:16.970
You've got to tell my mom!
My mom will come and get me!

08:18.263 --> 08:19.473
Mommy!

09:28.336 --> 09:29.337
Hi.

09:30.213 --> 09:31.339
I'm Bob.

09:36.803 --> 09:39.348
Is that "Maggie" short for "Margaret"?

09:42.434 --> 09:44.603
Mister, what is this place?

09:45.438 --> 09:46.605
Where am I?

09:47.523 --> 09:50.860
You're dead. At least,
that's what everybody thinks.

09:55.781 --> 09:57.158
Your funeral.

09:57.950 --> 10:00.203
We staged it Saturday afternoon.

10:01.705 --> 10:04.458
You're buried here. Oakmont Cemetery.

10:04.791 --> 10:06.293
Plot 48, row 12.

10:11.965 --> 10:15.051
- There's your father.
- Didn't my mother come?

10:16.303 --> 10:17.971
No, your mother, she...

10:25.730 --> 10:27.899
You know you can't get out.

10:34.322 --> 10:36.324
I work for some people.

10:37.074 --> 10:39.494
"The government," let's call them.

10:40.746 --> 10:43.332
We've decided to give you another chance.

10:48.337 --> 10:50.047
Is that about me?

10:50.756 --> 10:52.174
Yes, it is.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.234
You know a lot about me.

11:09.734 --> 11:10.735
We do.

11:11.945 --> 11:13.113
So...

11:14.239 --> 11:16.449
...you're gonna give me this chance?

11:19.035 --> 11:20.537
What do I gotta do?

11:21.247 --> 11:22.790
Learn, Maggie.

11:22.957 --> 11:26.127
Learn to speak properly,
learn to stand up straight, for a start.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.879
Learn languages, computers, and so on.

11:29.547 --> 11:32.383
Do something to help your country,
for a change.

11:34.301 --> 11:36.137
What if I'm not interested?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.602
Row 48...

11:43.395 --> 11:44.813
...plot 12.

11:58.076 --> 11:59.369
Can I think about it?

11:59.453 --> 12:01.788
Yeah, why don't you think about it?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.667
You've got one hour.

12:41.246 --> 12:43.248
Stupid fucking asshole!

12:47.253 --> 12:48.880
Come on, up! Up!

12:49.339 --> 12:50.715
Which way is out?

12:51.716 --> 12:52.967
This way.

12:56.721 --> 13:00.475
- Who are these assholes?
- Just people who work here. It's okay.

13:01.392 --> 13:04.730
Put it down. There's no problem.
Just go back to your desks.

13:04.814 --> 13:06.982
Bullshit! Everything's fucked!

13:07.983 --> 13:10.402
Come on. You know
you can't get away with this.

13:10.486 --> 13:11.570
Put it away!

13:11.654 --> 13:13.239
Get back to the wall.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.076
Everything's under control.

13:18.661 --> 13:20.246
- Open it!
- I can't!

13:21.163 --> 13:23.582
- Open the fucking door!
- I can't.

13:23.749 --> 13:25.877
- Tell them to do it!
- They won't.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.756
I'll blow his fucking brains out!

13:29.881 --> 13:31.591
They still won't do it.

13:37.264 --> 13:38.849
Just give me the gun.

13:39.432 --> 13:40.684
Good girl.

13:41.268 --> 13:42.894
Just put it down.

13:44.104 --> 13:45.481
Come on, Maggie.

13:45.606 --> 13:48.109
You're too smart to fight these odds.

13:49.277 --> 13:50.361
It's okay.

13:50.444 --> 13:52.113
It's okay. Put it down.

14:00.913 --> 14:02.415
Rule number one:

14:02.790 --> 14:04.876
Never chamber the first round.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.966
That'll slow you down for a while...

14:11.800 --> 14:13.510
..."Maggie for Margaret."

14:43.416 --> 14:44.501
So?

14:45.668 --> 14:47.588
What's it to be, yes or no?

14:48.589 --> 14:52.593
What if I said I have a couple of questions
and that I need some more time?

14:52.676 --> 14:54.512
What if I said there is no more time?

14:54.595 --> 14:57.681
What if I said you can kiss my ass
right in the crack?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.268
What's it gonna be, yes or no?

15:10.028 --> 15:12.656
I'm gonna have a few things that I'll need.

15:14.199 --> 15:15.951
I'm gonna need some stuff.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.120
I need some music.

15:20.038 --> 15:21.373
Some good music.

15:21.873 --> 15:23.959
I'm gonna want some Nina Simone.

15:25.544 --> 15:27.003
Nina Simone.

15:30.466 --> 15:31.968
Yeah, and...

15:33.010 --> 15:35.346
I want some more pain killers.

15:39.016 --> 15:41.060
My leg is fuckin' killing me.

15:50.070 --> 15:51.196
Is that it?

15:51.572 --> 15:52.990
I'll make a list.

15:54.992 --> 15:56.493
You do that, Maggie.

15:57.744 --> 15:59.413
Bet your fuckin' ass.

16:08.755 --> 16:11.176
We're gonna start
with a simple program first.

16:11.259 --> 16:14.888
This is just like a typewriter keyboard.
You got letters here...

16:14.971 --> 16:17.348
...numbers here. Return, okay?

16:17.765 --> 16:19.809
Tab... Wait, wait, wait.

16:20.268 --> 16:21.728
This is a mouse.

16:21.811 --> 16:25.023
You use this to write with, draw, save...
Things like that.

16:25.106 --> 16:28.276
See the roller? Roll that around
and watch the screen.

16:28.526 --> 16:29.777
Good, good.

16:30.613 --> 16:31.614
Wait!

16:31.780 --> 16:34.074
Wait, wait. Real easy, okay?

16:34.450 --> 16:38.954
Real easy. Like that. Now move the arrow
down to where it says, "Play."

16:40.456 --> 16:42.166
Right here, click once.

16:47.421 --> 16:49.340
<i>Pay attention, Maggie.</i>

16:55.222 --> 16:59.392
- Can we make the dinosaur eat him?
- You want to make the dinosaur eat him?

17:03.563 --> 17:04.981
Very good, very good.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.108
Feel a little bit more relaxed.

17:09.819 --> 17:10.820
You.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.075
I can't. My leg hurts.

17:14.157 --> 17:18.162
That's okay. We're just working
on reflexes. It'll be easy. Come on.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.175
I've taken my guard.
See if you can hit my face.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.807
Hit me. Come on, hit me.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.976
Hit me. Hit me. Come on.

18:24.064 --> 18:26.317
Always smile when you enter a room, dear.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.154
It relaxes others, and it lifts the features
of the face.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.919
You know what
"Nature's first green is gold" means?

18:45.879 --> 18:48.256
"Nature's first green is gold."

18:52.427 --> 18:54.597
It means that the first is best...

18:55.723 --> 18:58.100
...that youth is better than old age.

19:02.355 --> 19:06.025
You have the gift of youth.
That is what we'll build on.

19:11.614 --> 19:14.784
It's charming, my dear,
but it doesn't address my point.

19:19.581 --> 19:20.958
Put the gum here.

19:37.767 --> 19:39.102
That's better.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.479
Sit down.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.910
Are you an ugly duckling...

19:56.328 --> 19:57.663
...or a swan?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.457
Because the choice is yours, you know.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.045
Belief is half of being.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.678
It's a fancy way of saying,
if you believe you're pretty...

20:12.761 --> 20:14.638
...then you will be pretty.

20:14.763 --> 20:16.140
You'll see.

20:19.102 --> 20:21.396
What do you do
when you're most uncomfortable?

20:21.480 --> 20:23.690
When you're angry or scared?

20:24.774 --> 20:25.984
I hit.

20:27.152 --> 20:29.070
You might want to try smiling.

20:29.154 --> 20:31.573
Just smile a little smile and...

20:32.199 --> 20:36.203
...say something offhand.
It doesn't have to fit the situation, really.

20:37.538 --> 20:38.706
Say...

20:40.958 --> 20:44.170
Say, "I never did mind
about the little things."

20:51.677 --> 20:52.678
Say it!

20:59.228 --> 21:00.729
Please, dear.

21:01.188 --> 21:03.315
A smile, and the sentence.

21:07.736 --> 21:09.655
"I never did mind..."

21:17.204 --> 21:19.040
"I never did mind...

21:20.250 --> 21:22.544
"...about the little things."

21:25.922 --> 21:27.757
<i>Chin up. Shoulders back.</i>

21:27.924 --> 21:30.176
Have some pride in yourself.

21:30.844 --> 21:31.970
Show me.

21:32.095 --> 21:33.346
Yes, Maggie.

21:33.513 --> 21:34.931
Better. Good.

21:35.098 --> 21:37.058
<i>"I lie down for a nap today.</i>

21:37.142 --> 21:39.186
"Yesterday I lay down for a nap.

21:39.270 --> 21:42.064
"If something unfortunate happens,
I feel bad..."

21:42.148 --> 21:43.190
Louder, please.

21:43.274 --> 21:46.902
"I feel 'bad' about it, not 'badly.'
'Bad' is an adjective.

21:47.111 --> 21:51.782
"Remember to say, 'It is a secret
between her and me.' Not, 'she and I."'

22:09.801 --> 22:12.637
Turn it down, will you?
Please, turn it down.

22:12.971 --> 22:17.142
People are beginning to complain.
Why don't you use the headset I got you?

22:17.267 --> 22:18.894
'Cause they're crappy.

22:24.775 --> 22:26.319
You know, you...

22:33.451 --> 22:35.286
This is Nina Simone.

22:37.497 --> 22:39.415
You got it for me, remember?

22:42.169 --> 22:44.087
She wants sugar in her bowl?

22:45.047 --> 22:46.757
No, she's saying:

22:47.174 --> 22:51.595
"Baby, just stick it in me twice a day,
and I'll do anything for you.

22:52.221 --> 22:54.598
"I'll lick the ground you walk on."

22:56.850 --> 22:58.519
Why do you talk so dirty?

22:58.602 --> 23:00.354
Why do you talk so faggy?

23:04.359 --> 23:06.194
So, how is it going?

23:08.696 --> 23:10.824
Man, I'm so majorly bored.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.371
Think I'm going crazy. Started talking
to myself and all kinds of stuff.

23:17.038 --> 23:18.623
Your reports are excellent.

23:18.706 --> 23:19.958
All right!

23:20.875 --> 23:24.964
So, do I get a reward or something?
It's my birthday next week.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.883
Why don't you let me go outside?

23:29.134 --> 23:30.636
Just for one night?

23:31.679 --> 23:33.389
You can have me followed.

23:37.560 --> 23:38.644
Please!

23:38.727 --> 23:40.312
I can't. Okay?

23:46.653 --> 23:48.196
Look, Maggie...

23:50.073 --> 23:51.616
...I know how you feel.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.493
- Bullshit!
- Yes, I do.

23:53.743 --> 23:55.912
I used to be a recruit myself.

23:56.371 --> 23:58.373
I used to be where you are now.

23:58.498 --> 24:01.501
And, just like you,
I hated every moment of it.

24:03.253 --> 24:05.006
So you understand.

24:05.590 --> 24:09.552
I'm going stir-crazy. Please!
Just let me go out for a walk.

24:10.887 --> 24:12.388
I said I can't.

24:12.722 --> 24:14.432
That's it. Okay?

24:27.196 --> 24:29.239
I want to go for a walk!

24:30.282 --> 24:31.617
Girl number five?

24:31.700 --> 24:34.453
Take out the bad guys.
Do not shoot the good guys.

24:34.536 --> 24:36.705
You got two seconds for each target.

24:36.788 --> 24:37.998
Understand?

24:38.290 --> 24:39.708
Ready, set...

24:39.917 --> 24:41.293
...and go.

24:57.310 --> 24:58.853
What was that?

25:00.230 --> 25:01.981
- Fun.
- Yeah, right.

25:02.565 --> 25:04.234
What is it with you?

25:06.779 --> 25:09.156
Eating should be graceful, yet natural.

25:09.657 --> 25:12.910
If you get a bone in your mouth,
take it out with your fingers...

25:12.993 --> 25:14.870
...and put it on the edge of your plate.

25:14.954 --> 25:17.289
No fake middle-class delicacy.

25:17.498 --> 25:20.000
No hiding the bone behind a napkin.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.254
Today we'll start with the entrée.

25:23.963 --> 25:25.256
Let's begin.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.668
Bone!

26:12.639 --> 26:14.224
May I be excused?

26:19.813 --> 26:21.148
You've done better.

26:21.231 --> 26:25.569
She's a pain, but I can bring her around.
She's got great potential.

26:26.069 --> 26:29.616
I like her potential, too.
She has some mighty nice potential.

26:30.825 --> 26:33.244
So, bottom-line me about this girl.

26:33.661 --> 26:36.664
We need a young female operative.
I think she's the one.

26:36.748 --> 26:39.417
Usually, it takes two years. In this case...

26:39.501 --> 26:40.835
Six months.

26:41.336 --> 26:44.672
That's right. I don't want to see
any more attitude from her.

26:44.756 --> 26:49.094
Enough with this crap. She bites,
she kicks, she throws food... what is that?

26:49.637 --> 26:51.096
So, you got it?

26:51.263 --> 26:55.851
Six months. I want immediate results
or she gets a bullet in the brain.

27:15.872 --> 27:17.082
Turn it off.

27:21.711 --> 27:23.505
Ask me why I'm so serious.

27:24.381 --> 27:25.841
Why are you so serious?

27:25.924 --> 27:29.637
Because I've got serious stuff to tell you,
"Maggie for Margaret."

27:31.806 --> 27:33.474
First, the good stuff.

27:56.165 --> 27:57.624
Happy birthday.

28:00.127 --> 28:02.171
Okay, now the bad stuff.

28:02.838 --> 28:05.257
Kaufman has drawn a line in the sand.

28:05.424 --> 28:08.510
He says he's not gonna take
any more crap from you.

28:08.635 --> 28:11.681
He mentioned the word "bullet"
and the word "brain."

28:11.764 --> 28:14.726
You hearing me? Is this going in, Maggie?

28:14.934 --> 28:18.021
Because I want you to know,
it's now out of my hands.

28:34.121 --> 28:35.372
Happy birthday.

29:03.318 --> 29:04.694
Will you help me?

29:06.196 --> 29:08.073
Of course. Come upstairs.

29:08.824 --> 29:12.620
All you need is balance.
We have to find your feminine strength.

29:13.913 --> 29:16.082
Some moon to go with your sun.

29:16.916 --> 29:19.502
A bit of the poet to balance the warrior.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.529
Don't you want to carry your jacket?

29:45.612 --> 29:47.531
Surely not just for a dinner lesson.

29:47.614 --> 29:48.949
What's worth doing...

29:49.032 --> 29:52.286
...is worth doing well.
- You've mentioned that before.

29:52.369 --> 29:55.039
<i>Et tu as pris longtemps pour I'apprendre,
ma chère.</i>

29:55.123 --> 29:58.126
<i>J'ai pensé me le faire tatouer sur le bras.</i>

29:58.251 --> 29:59.627
Very good!

30:02.297 --> 30:03.548
You look...

30:03.798 --> 30:05.133
...beautiful.

30:07.635 --> 30:10.555
You've really outdone yourself this time.

30:11.139 --> 30:13.474
Yes, about this one, I am pleased.

30:13.558 --> 30:16.854
Then why do I have to have
another dinner lesson after six months?

30:16.937 --> 30:21.233
Or are you afraid I'll revert
and put my feet back up on the table?

30:21.817 --> 30:23.152
I think that...

30:23.569 --> 30:25.988
...tonight we should have dinner out.

30:29.366 --> 30:30.451
Really?

30:32.161 --> 30:33.537
Thank you!

30:35.832 --> 30:37.292
Shall we go?

32:09.471 --> 32:12.433
Good evening. Would you like
to see the wine list?

32:12.516 --> 32:15.519
No, thanks. Just a bottle
of Dom Perignon, please.

32:15.603 --> 32:16.896
Very good, sir.

32:19.566 --> 32:20.692
Thank you.

32:38.794 --> 32:40.546
Don't open it yet.

32:41.964 --> 32:43.424
That's fine.

33:03.362 --> 33:05.656
More than you can possibly imagine...

33:06.448 --> 33:08.492
...I wish you every good thing.

33:25.218 --> 33:26.427
It's loaded.

33:28.429 --> 33:29.389
I don't understand.

33:29.472 --> 33:32.767
A lady and two men
are sitting behind you on the balcony.

33:33.893 --> 33:35.854
The man on the right is a VIP.

33:36.271 --> 33:38.231
The other one's his bodyguard.

33:38.940 --> 33:42.570
I want you to put two bullets in the VIP...
two bullets minimum.

33:43.279 --> 33:45.030
Then go to the men's room.

33:45.197 --> 33:48.951
In the last stall there's a small window
that leads to a courtyard.

33:49.034 --> 33:51.287
There will be a car waiting for you.

33:53.873 --> 33:55.875
Don't do anything till I leave.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.460
You've got three minutes, okay?

38:19.735 --> 38:21.486
It was bricked in.

38:22.529 --> 38:24.406
The window was all bricked in.

38:24.489 --> 38:26.408
Yes, of course it was.

38:27.326 --> 38:29.078
That was your final test.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.582
Motherfucker!

38:36.920 --> 38:39.005
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Son of a bitch!

38:39.088 --> 38:40.924
You get out tomorrow!

38:42.675 --> 38:44.511
You get out tomorrow.

38:46.221 --> 38:49.224
That was your last test.
You get out tomorrow.

39:11.873 --> 39:13.792
I'm really gonna miss you.

39:15.168 --> 39:16.378
You know that.

39:28.598 --> 39:30.560
I'll never kiss you again.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.176
What level of operation is she ready for?

40:03.802 --> 40:04.761
S-1.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.680
Ambitious as ever.

40:09.224 --> 40:10.475
Don't sit down.

40:12.228 --> 40:14.022
I need her ready by March.

40:16.274 --> 40:17.942
You're gonna love this.

40:18.026 --> 40:20.528
A woman goes into a bar
with a duck under her arm.

40:20.612 --> 40:24.324
She orders a few beers. Bartender says,
"What're you doing with that pig?"

40:24.407 --> 40:28.411
She says, "This is a duck."
He says, "I was talking to the duck."

40:29.787 --> 40:31.581
I was talking to the duck!

40:33.626 --> 40:35.377
I think you're dangerous.

40:36.420 --> 40:41.050
A real loose cannon. If it was up to me
we'd put you down, so make no mistakes.

40:41.675 --> 40:45.804
I'm telling you, if you cross on a red light,
you are worm bait.

40:46.805 --> 40:47.890
<i>Entiende?</i>

40:51.560 --> 40:52.561
'Bye.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.946
I was talking to the duck.

41:01.613 --> 41:06.159
Your name's Claudia Doran. You're from
Chicago. You live in Venice, California.

41:06.326 --> 41:09.829
You're a computer expert for Super Mac.
You travel a lot.

41:10.664 --> 41:14.001
Here's your passport,
driver's license, birth certificate.

41:14.835 --> 41:17.588
There's cash in here
to buy yourself a new car.

41:18.839 --> 41:20.841
Your code name is Nina.

41:23.970 --> 41:25.721
As in Nina Simone?

41:29.934 --> 41:31.102
Yeah.

41:31.310 --> 41:32.687
I'm scared.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.105
You?

41:34.857 --> 41:36.483
That'll be the day.

41:41.321 --> 41:42.489
Go on.

43:34.648 --> 43:35.899
I warned you.

43:39.153 --> 43:40.822
It needs a lot of work!

43:43.408 --> 43:45.243
That's not a urine stain.

43:46.578 --> 43:47.829
It's fully...

43:51.207 --> 43:54.502
Actually, there's another one
that's closer to being done.

44:14.648 --> 44:15.941
I'll take it.

44:21.281 --> 44:22.449
All right.

46:00.885 --> 46:02.137
Here's your...

46:02.470 --> 46:03.638
...ravioli.

46:05.223 --> 46:06.933
And your ravioli.

46:08.143 --> 46:09.394
And your...

46:09.686 --> 46:11.813
...oh, my goodness, it's ravioli.

46:12.397 --> 46:13.481
Thanks.

46:14.608 --> 46:18.069
Cammie Swiss Cake Rolls.
Now that sounds nutritious.

46:19.571 --> 46:24.076
Sorry. I suppose it's embarrassing to have
some fool pawing through your food.

46:24.785 --> 46:27.496
Don't worry about it.
I don't get embarrassed.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.373
What do you mean?

46:29.957 --> 46:31.584
Just, nothing embarrasses me.

46:31.667 --> 46:32.919
You mean, ever?

46:37.590 --> 46:40.509
That's great! You'll have
to teach me that trick.

46:44.264 --> 46:45.682
Where're you from?

46:49.102 --> 46:51.271
- It's not a trick question.
- Chicago.

46:51.355 --> 46:52.773
I'm from Denver.

46:53.774 --> 46:56.944
So I know you're from Chicago,
and you love ravioli.

46:57.694 --> 46:58.946
That's a start.

47:03.450 --> 47:06.037
So how does someone
get to know you better?

47:07.914 --> 47:09.582
For you, it'd be easy.

47:09.707 --> 47:11.876
Then have dinner with me tonight.

47:13.711 --> 47:14.879
Okay.

47:15.380 --> 47:16.798
Let me guess...

47:17.549 --> 47:18.550
Ravioli?

47:20.176 --> 47:21.302
It's a deal.

47:22.262 --> 47:24.974
All I have to do is show any apartment
that's vacant...

47:25.057 --> 47:27.977
...change some light bulbs,
sweep the stairs once a week...

47:28.060 --> 47:30.312
...pick up rent checks. For that...

47:30.896 --> 47:32.565
...half off my own rent.

47:32.731 --> 47:35.985
Mostly what I do, though,
is work on my portfolio.

47:36.485 --> 47:37.987
I'm a photographer.

47:38.863 --> 47:40.948
I take some good stuff sometimes.

47:41.031 --> 47:44.827
I've sold to some galleries.
Weston and Levinson's, you know?

47:45.745 --> 47:48.707
All day, though, all I do is run around...

47:49.749 --> 47:51.751
...and just take care of stuff.

48:01.928 --> 48:03.847
You really like ravioli, huh?

48:37.883 --> 48:39.885
I usually make the first move.

48:41.803 --> 48:43.263
This is fine, too.

50:43.598 --> 50:44.849
This is hard.

50:45.016 --> 50:46.601
Shut up and finish it.

50:46.893 --> 50:49.771
- It's hard as hell.
- Shut up and finish it.

50:50.104 --> 50:51.649
Let's go out, get a hamburger...

50:51.732 --> 50:53.651
Shut up and finish it.

50:55.110 --> 50:58.197
I'll call Ned and Karen
and see if they want to come.

50:59.114 --> 51:00.199
Sure.

51:01.283 --> 51:04.161
You don't really like them much, do you?

51:05.454 --> 51:06.664
They're okay.

51:09.208 --> 51:11.836
Why don't you ask somebody sometime?

51:12.462 --> 51:13.672
Like who?

51:13.797 --> 51:15.048
I don't know.

51:15.632 --> 51:19.553
A friend. One of your buddies.
Somebody you like to hang around with.

51:19.844 --> 51:23.056
You haven't had one person
in this place in four months.

51:23.765 --> 51:24.975
I know.

51:25.183 --> 51:26.476
Not one.

51:28.687 --> 51:30.397
'Cause I want only you.

51:32.275 --> 51:33.609
You're so guarded.

51:33.693 --> 51:35.027
I'm not guarded.

51:35.111 --> 51:37.154
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

51:37.530 --> 51:39.949
You're like living with a ghost.

51:40.700 --> 51:42.618
You never tell me anything.

51:46.038 --> 51:47.832
All right. So, then...

51:49.041 --> 51:50.960
...what do you want to know?

51:52.963 --> 51:56.925
I don't know. I want to know
what your fifth-grade teacher was like.

51:57.384 --> 52:01.221
I want to know if this pretty face
had pimples on it in high school.

52:02.598 --> 52:04.933
I want to meet your friends from work.

52:05.017 --> 52:09.062
I want to know why you listen to Nina
Simone when you're in a bad mood.

52:22.952 --> 52:24.203
Forget it.

52:49.813 --> 52:51.941
My mother loved Nina Simone.

52:54.986 --> 52:57.572
She used to play her records all the time.

53:02.452 --> 53:04.996
I grew up listening to this music.

53:06.081 --> 53:07.082
It...

53:09.626 --> 53:11.127
...sounded so...

53:13.088 --> 53:14.506
...passionate...

53:15.341 --> 53:16.842
...so savage.

53:20.930 --> 53:22.974
All about love and loss.

53:28.437 --> 53:31.357
I play Nina Simone
when I think about my mother.

54:04.100 --> 54:05.518
<i>- Hello?
- Nina?</i>

54:10.315 --> 54:12.650
<i>J.W. Marriott in Century City.</i>

54:12.817 --> 54:15.153
<i>Personnel entrance. One hour.</i>

54:16.572 --> 54:17.698
All right.

54:18.991 --> 54:20.034
'Bye.

54:21.702 --> 54:22.995
Who's that?

54:24.872 --> 54:27.958
I'm about to lose a sale on 500 video cards.

54:28.584 --> 54:31.295
I gotta go all the way to El Segundo.

54:35.549 --> 54:36.675
Hurry back.

54:37.636 --> 54:38.762
I will.

55:06.916 --> 55:08.084
Excuse me.

55:10.253 --> 55:11.504
What do I do?

55:16.551 --> 55:17.718
Change.

55:36.572 --> 55:37.656
Now what?

55:38.490 --> 55:39.909
Now we wait.

55:40.743 --> 55:42.579
Testing, one... two... three.

55:44.914 --> 55:46.749
<i>Testing, one... two... three.</i>

56:13.235 --> 56:15.112
Good morning. Room service.

56:17.072 --> 56:21.077
Certainly. About 15 minutes.
Yes, sir. Thank you for calling.

56:42.141 --> 56:44.977
- What do I do?
- Take this tray where I tell you.

56:45.311 --> 56:46.646
- Then?
- Nothing.

56:46.729 --> 56:50.942
You take the tray up, give him the tray
and you come back down here.

56:51.359 --> 56:52.985
That too much for you?

57:47.042 --> 57:48.043
Thanks.

57:54.883 --> 57:56.385
Now what do I do?

57:57.261 --> 57:58.554
Go home.

57:58.971 --> 58:00.139
That's it?

59:07.001 --> 59:08.002
So?

59:08.628 --> 59:09.963
How are you?

59:10.588 --> 59:13.341
I just blew up a hotel.
How the hell do you think I am?

59:13.424 --> 59:17.345
Everybody at headquarters,
especially Kaufman, is very happy.

59:17.512 --> 59:19.764
I just thought you'd like to know that.

59:19.847 --> 59:21.140
Fabulous.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.769
So, I hear you've met somebody.

59:28.399 --> 59:29.692
What's he like?

59:31.402 --> 59:33.153
He's really great.

59:33.362 --> 59:35.823
I never would've met him
if it hadn't been for you.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.408
I have to meet him.

59:37.491 --> 59:38.450
What?

59:38.534 --> 59:41.120
Yeah. It's just a routine checkup.

59:44.623 --> 59:47.544
- I can't.
- Just invite me to dinner, okay?

59:49.462 --> 59:50.547
No.

59:52.340 --> 59:54.092
Just invite me to dinner.

59:58.972 --> 01:00:00.181
Uncle Bob!

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:02.183
You must be J.P.

01:00:02.517 --> 01:00:04.019
You shouldn't.

01:00:05.729 --> 01:00:07.064
You should've.

01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:08.232
Come on.

01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:14.697
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
I haven't met any of her family.

01:00:15.865 --> 01:00:17.033
Claudia.

01:00:19.785 --> 01:00:21.495
Long time no see.

01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:23.289
Uncle Bob.

01:00:25.082 --> 01:00:26.208
You look...

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:28.378
...great! Really great!

01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:29.963
Thanks.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:34.718
- Can we get you...
- Something to drink?

01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:38.096
Scotch. Scotch would be nice.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:41.558
Here. These are from Uncle Bob.

01:00:41.767 --> 01:00:42.976
Great!

01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:46.063
She looks really beautiful.

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:48.650
Must be something to do with you.

01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:49.817
It is.

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:55.114
You know, you're older than I thought.

01:00:56.908 --> 01:00:59.953
I bet you're not the youngest photographer
in town.

01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:02.622
That's true.

01:01:02.914 --> 01:01:06.542
But the other guys are just out
of high school. They have no experience.

01:01:06.626 --> 01:01:10.256
He may not be the youngest,
but he's certainly the cutest.

01:01:14.093 --> 01:01:15.261
So...

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.430
How old are you, Uncle Bob?

01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:19.932
I'm...

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.268
...37.

01:01:23.894 --> 01:01:25.771
So that makes you...

01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:27.189
Thirteen years older.

01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:30.860
It's funny. The other day
I was reading something, it was really...

01:01:30.944 --> 01:01:34.322
It's actually closer to 14.
Her birthday's in three months.

01:01:34.573 --> 01:01:36.908
What exactly is your point, P.J.?

01:01:36.992 --> 01:01:38.118
J.P.

01:01:38.243 --> 01:01:39.452
You guys!

01:01:39.578 --> 01:01:40.870
Wait a minute.

01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:45.458
Easy. Why don't you just arm-wrestle
right now and get it over with?

01:01:52.967 --> 01:01:54.719
What was she like as a child?

01:01:54.802 --> 01:01:59.015
I ask her all the time. She never talks
about herself. No details, nothing.

01:01:59.098 --> 01:02:00.850
- Let me see.
- What?

01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:07.481
He just wanted to know what you were like
when you were a little girl.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.859
You promised.

01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:14.072
- She hates questions.
- Do I ask you questions?

01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:16.074
No, I wish you would, though.

01:02:16.158 --> 01:02:18.827
- Can't we just drop it?
- Not this time.

01:02:18.911 --> 01:02:22.497
Don't you fucking get it?
I don't want to talk about it!

01:02:22.915 --> 01:02:27.210
I didn't drag my ass from the gutter
in Kansas City to take shit from you!

01:02:53.447 --> 01:02:55.532
I thought you were from Chicago.

01:02:58.202 --> 01:02:59.662
Kansas City.

01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:03.540
She was born in Kansas City
but raised in Chicago.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:08.462
I used to see her during the summers
on my uncle's farm.

01:03:10.839 --> 01:03:13.885
You didn't know she spent summers
on a farm, did you?

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:16.930
Well, she did.

01:03:18.348 --> 01:03:20.100
I remember one summer...

01:03:20.892 --> 01:03:22.394
...the local kids...

01:03:23.728 --> 01:03:26.356
...the kids' family owned this mare.

01:03:26.773 --> 01:03:27.983
She was...

01:03:28.233 --> 01:03:32.654
...black as a raven's wing, completely wild.
Remember? They called her Beauty.

01:03:34.282 --> 01:03:37.994
She was trained as a trotter,
but she'd never really been ridden.

01:03:38.077 --> 01:03:39.245
Anyway...

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:42.832
The kids told Claudia
that she had to ride Beauty...

01:03:43.874 --> 01:03:47.920
...that it was like an initiation,
a kind of thing they all had to do.

01:03:48.546 --> 01:03:50.548
Anyway, one day, I remember...

01:03:50.798 --> 01:03:52.133
...about noon...

01:03:52.758 --> 01:03:54.678
...it was really, really hot.

01:03:55.345 --> 01:03:56.930
We heard this scream.

01:03:57.973 --> 01:03:59.558
We ran outside.

01:04:00.851 --> 01:04:02.311
There was Claudia.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:04.438
Claudia...

01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:07.274
...bareback on this wild horse.

01:04:08.609 --> 01:04:11.528
The horse went completely crazy.
Bucked, reared.

01:04:12.654 --> 01:04:14.031
She hung on.

01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:17.619
She just gritted her teeth,
dug her heels in...

01:04:18.786 --> 01:04:20.246
...and she hung on.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:24.083
By God, she rode that horse.

01:04:27.629 --> 01:04:30.173
I guess that's how I remember her really.

01:04:31.132 --> 01:04:33.676
This slip of a girl on a wild black horse.

01:04:37.723 --> 01:04:39.475
She was so beautiful.

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:44.146
She was so beautiful that she gleamed.

01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:52.988
Do you know what I mean?

01:04:54.114 --> 01:04:55.575
That's really you.

01:04:59.704 --> 01:05:02.332
That's what I'd have thought you'd be like.

01:05:05.794 --> 01:05:07.087
By the way...

01:05:07.545 --> 01:05:09.881
...did Claudia tell you what I do?

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:13.385
No.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.264
I'm in the travel business.

01:05:16.347 --> 01:05:19.141
I'm a partner in a travel agency and...

01:05:22.311 --> 01:05:25.856
...I've got these two tickets here,
if you'd like to take them.

01:05:26.399 --> 01:05:29.026
They're for New Orleans
for the Mardi Gras.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.320
Thought you might like to go.

01:05:34.824 --> 01:05:36.200
You're so sweet.

01:05:38.245 --> 01:05:40.872
I'll enjoy thinking of both of you there.

01:05:41.665 --> 01:05:42.666
I will.

01:06:36.597 --> 01:06:39.267
- I'm hungry!
- We gotta get out of here!

01:06:41.102 --> 01:06:42.562
We gotta go!

01:06:49.402 --> 01:06:51.029
Let's go to the hotel!

01:06:51.279 --> 01:06:53.198
Wait! Let's try here!

01:06:55.116 --> 01:06:56.493
Down here!

01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:00.122
Can't we just eat here?

01:07:00.206 --> 01:07:03.376
Food's crappy. I know that place
is just down here.

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.127
You better be right.

01:07:12.385 --> 01:07:13.928
It's right over here.

01:07:24.022 --> 01:07:25.732
What do you want?

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.903
We want your money.

01:07:29.987 --> 01:07:32.906
Maybe you could help us out
with something to eat.

01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:35.659
Me and my friend, we real hungry now.

01:07:35.909 --> 01:07:38.495
That's real good
but we want all your money.

01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:41.499
Go to hell.

01:07:49.757 --> 01:07:50.758
Come on!

01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:53.469
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

01:07:54.095 --> 01:07:57.265
You beat the hell out of them.
You didn't even give me a chance.

01:07:57.348 --> 01:07:58.600
It was just a reflex.

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:02.021
You've got some reflexes!
Where'd you learn how to do that?

01:08:07.234 --> 01:08:08.736
I don't know.

01:08:09.945 --> 01:08:13.616
I took a self-defense class once
when I was just a girl.

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:24.544
I'm so hungry!

01:08:28.256 --> 01:08:30.008
I gotta have food.

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:34.304
What is it? It's five, right?

01:08:36.221 --> 01:08:38.725
<i>- Room service. May I help you?
- Hello?</i>

01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:44.064
This is Room 30.

01:08:47.026 --> 01:08:49.612
I'd like to order some food, please.

01:08:52.073 --> 01:08:54.617
Could I have a couple of chicken salads...

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.620
...and a couple of pieces of pecan pie...

01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:00.957
...and what kind of soda do you have?

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:07.046
All right, then. I guess I'll have...

01:09:10.133 --> 01:09:11.760
I'll take Pepsi.

01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:15.930
Can I have four cans of that,
because we get thirsty after sex?

01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:26.943
Kiss my neck.

01:09:27.193 --> 01:09:28.236
Okay.

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:32.031
Kiss it harder.

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.791
Yes?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.001
<i>Nina?</i>

01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:47.548
Yes?

01:09:47.923 --> 01:09:50.634
<i>The bathroom cabinet
has a hidden compartment.</i>

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.307
All right.

01:09:57.099 --> 01:10:00.102
Then make it two pieces
of chocolate-rum cake.

01:10:05.317 --> 01:10:06.735
They're all out of pecan pie.

01:10:06.818 --> 01:10:08.778
Okay, we're out of this joint.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.784
I gotta take a bath. I feel really dirty.

01:10:15.535 --> 01:10:18.496
If you could just wait
for room service, please.

01:10:48.946 --> 01:10:50.238
Nina in position.

01:10:50.322 --> 01:10:52.240
<i>First item's under the sink.</i>

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.315
<i>- Assembly completed.
- Open the window.</i>

01:11:34.326 --> 01:11:36.537
<i>- There's no handle.
- Open the window.</i>

01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:40.833
- Claudia?
- Yeah?

01:11:42.459 --> 01:11:44.586
You know what I've been thinking?

01:11:46.672 --> 01:11:47.757
What?

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:50.468
I've got a really good idea.

01:11:53.096 --> 01:11:56.725
Just thinking we could make Bob's present
an engagement present.

01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:59.603
Save the poor slob some money.

01:12:10.865 --> 01:12:12.033
Okay.

01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:16.954
What do you say, you want to do it?
Make it formal?

01:12:18.289 --> 01:12:19.332
Honey?

01:12:23.628 --> 01:12:24.962
<i>The limousine.</i>

01:12:28.341 --> 01:12:30.093
<i>Take aim on the limousine.</i>

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:33.889
<i>We're waiting for further instructions.</i>

01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:40.896
I asked you a question.
Don't I deserve an answer?

01:12:40.979 --> 01:12:42.230
In a minute.

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:46.860
It's how I always imagined it.
Proposing through a door.

01:12:52.825 --> 01:12:54.786
Christ! What is it with you?

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.833
Say something.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.670
Say, "Go to hell, J.P."
Tell me you love me...

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:07.298
...or "Get lost" or whatever.
Just answer me, okay?

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.181
Room service.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:21.355
<i>- How many targets?
- One.</i>

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:25.150
<i>- What's he look like?
- I haven't been informed yet.</i>

01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:30.407
How're you enjoying
our beautiful Mardi Gras?

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:31.449
Real well.

01:13:31.533 --> 01:13:33.535
<i>Target visible in five seconds.</i>

01:13:45.547 --> 01:13:48.341
- Thanks.
- Y'all come back and see us, you hear?

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:51.345
Which one is it?

01:13:51.512 --> 01:13:53.347
<i>I don't have that data yet.</i>

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:55.975
You've got nothing to say to me?

01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:57.810
Which target, dammit?

01:13:58.519 --> 01:13:59.729
<i>The woman.</i>

01:14:06.277 --> 01:14:07.737
<i>The woman in white.</i>

01:14:14.077 --> 01:14:15.871
<i>The woman in white, I said.</i>

01:14:25.088 --> 01:14:26.548
<i>The fucking woman!</i>

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.979
What is with you?

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:43.483
What the hell's going on?

01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:47.946
What's this?

01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:55.037
You've got nothing to say to me?

01:14:57.122 --> 01:14:59.959
A while ago, I did something really bad.

01:15:03.128 --> 01:15:06.882
I came through it,
but I'm always gonna be paying for it.

01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:11.762
It's okay.

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:18.979
It's in the past.

01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:20.939
You can just let it go.

01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:23.108
I can't.

01:15:26.528 --> 01:15:28.446
But you've got to believe me.

01:15:30.657 --> 01:15:32.325
If I'm secretive...

01:15:33.285 --> 01:15:35.288
...I've got my reasons.

01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:39.834
For now, I'll take that.

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.338
For now.

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:26.549
Students, this is a defensive tactic.
Watch me.

01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:31.387
So how was New Orleans?

01:16:33.848 --> 01:16:36.060
Everything you touch turns to shit.

01:16:39.855 --> 01:16:44.318
Why'd you send me on a job with J.P.?
What happens to him if he finds out?

01:16:44.568 --> 01:16:46.779
I know it wasn't an easy job.

01:16:46.946 --> 01:16:49.114
You're so pathetic. Listen to you.

01:16:49.198 --> 01:16:53.077
You stand there with that little smile.
Drop the fucking mask, for once.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.245
Fuck you! That was my last job.

01:16:57.082 --> 01:16:59.292
You stupid, ignorant little girl.

01:16:59.459 --> 01:17:02.337
You think you can decide
you don't want to play anymore?

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.714
Where the fuck do you think you are?

01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:07.175
Haven't you heard anything that I've said?

01:17:07.258 --> 01:17:09.427
- I mean it!
- You don't know what you're saying.

01:17:09.511 --> 01:17:13.306
- I'm through! I'm out!
- Which word do you not understand?

01:17:13.556 --> 01:17:16.935
There is no "out." There is no "through."
There is no out!

01:17:26.279 --> 01:17:27.863
You've gotta help me.

01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:31.284
I can't do this.
I can't live like this anymore.

01:17:35.621 --> 01:17:38.166
Don't you like me well enough to help me?

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:40.043
Like you?

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.297
I know...

01:17:43.755 --> 01:17:46.883
...you like that you made me
into something different.

01:17:48.427 --> 01:17:50.804
But you're not looking close enough.

01:17:51.179 --> 01:17:52.597
I am different.

01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:55.600
Help me be better.

01:17:57.894 --> 01:17:59.897
Please, Bob, let me go.

01:18:16.873 --> 01:18:18.876
You know who Fahd Bahktiar is?

01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:23.714
He's one of the world's richest men.

01:18:23.797 --> 01:18:26.884
He's peddling nuclear information
to the Middle East.

01:18:27.176 --> 01:18:31.180
I need a woman for this one.
It's the kind of job you were trained for.

01:18:33.015 --> 01:18:34.975
I want you to do three things.

01:18:35.309 --> 01:18:38.729
One: Impersonate his girlfriend
so you can get into his house.

01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:43.360
Two: Take the disk that he's been sending
the data on, then destroy his computer.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.362
And number three:

01:18:46.237 --> 01:18:48.031
I want you to take him out.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.372
If I do this job, if I bring this off...

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.583
...will you do what you can
to help me get out?

01:19:04.298 --> 01:19:05.383
No.

01:19:23.151 --> 01:19:24.778
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:27.489
Would you take these, John? Thanks.

01:19:32.202 --> 01:19:34.288
Maggie! What a pleasure!

01:19:35.414 --> 01:19:36.873
How are you?

01:19:39.084 --> 01:19:40.836
Does anybody ever get out?

01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.340
Thank you, John. I'll do the rest.

01:19:46.884 --> 01:19:50.555
Were you like me once?
Would they let you leave if you wanted to?

01:19:52.849 --> 01:19:57.186
Happiness in life comes from braiding
together what one would like to have...

01:19:57.478 --> 01:19:58.813
...with what is inevitable.

01:19:58.896 --> 01:20:02.026
Stop that shit! Stop talking like that
and answer me!

01:20:05.904 --> 01:20:07.031
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.449 --> 01:20:12.870
I don't want to be rude to you. You were
the only one who was nice to me here.

01:20:16.624 --> 01:20:18.417
Please, could you tell me?

01:20:20.377 --> 01:20:22.797
Could you just leave if you wanted to?

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.467
Just get on a plane and disappear?

01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:29.721
To tell the truth, dear...

01:20:29.804 --> 01:20:33.850
...I don't know. It's a possibility
that never entered my mind.

01:20:43.486 --> 01:20:45.279
You won't tell Bob I came?

01:20:46.906 --> 01:20:47.990
Thank you.

01:21:06.969 --> 01:21:08.804
- You look tired.
- I am.

01:21:09.137 --> 01:21:11.139
- Want a back rub?
- Yeah.

01:21:11.264 --> 01:21:13.433
- With the hypnotic fantasy oil?
- Yeah.

01:21:13.517 --> 01:21:14.643
All right.

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.353
On the bed.

01:21:16.436 --> 01:21:17.938
I'll be right back.

01:21:24.027 --> 01:21:25.238
Hello, Maggie.

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.826
These are copies of the photos I gave you.

01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:32.120
Amanda says that you...

01:21:33.204 --> 01:21:34.539
...dropped them.

01:21:36.082 --> 01:21:37.875
I don't think I can do it.

01:21:45.092 --> 01:21:47.344
If you pull this job off for me...

01:21:48.887 --> 01:21:51.265
...I'll see what I can do to help you.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:00.649
See the upstairs corner?

01:22:00.899 --> 01:22:04.862
That's his bedroom. Right here.
You arrive early. You do it here.

01:22:05.446 --> 01:22:08.366
With the right wig, clothes,
attitude, you can...

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:11.578
...Iook sufficiently like the girlfriend
to get into his house.

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:13.830
What happens to her? Does she die, too?

01:22:13.913 --> 01:22:16.541
Absolutely not. No unnecessary wetworks.

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:18.752
Good.

01:22:20.253 --> 01:22:23.548
Look at those earrings.
Got the buck in the walk.

01:22:24.549 --> 01:22:26.092
I have those glasses.

01:22:26.177 --> 01:22:29.096
- Yeah? Great.
- I'll get that brand of cigarettes.

01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:31.223
- She's right-handed.
- Me, too.

01:22:31.307 --> 01:22:32.725
Long cigarettes.

01:22:33.517 --> 01:22:34.935
Is that mole real?

01:22:35.019 --> 01:22:36.228
Not on me, it won't be.

01:22:36.312 --> 01:22:37.730
Here we go again.

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:43.152
<i>"Happy birthday to you"</i>

01:22:49.952 --> 01:22:51.578
<i>They don't go out!</i>

01:22:51.745 --> 01:22:53.372
It won't go out.

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:58.168
<i>It's heavy.</i>

01:22:58.585 --> 01:23:00.003
"It's heavy."

01:23:03.006 --> 01:23:04.800
<i>Get out of the way now.</i>

01:23:05.258 --> 01:23:07.260
"Get out of the way now."

01:23:09.973 --> 01:23:11.224
There he is.

01:23:13.643 --> 01:23:17.605
<i>Frank, for Christ's sake,
do us a favor and put the camera away.</i>

01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:18.815
All right.

01:23:19.565 --> 01:23:21.275
Let's go over it again.

01:23:21.651 --> 01:23:23.653
We've only done it 20 times.

01:23:23.736 --> 01:23:26.739
Look, it's tomorrow night.
This is our last chance.

01:23:26.864 --> 01:23:29.785
Okay. We meet at 4:00 to go to Angela's.

01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:32.663
Let's make it a quarter to.

01:23:32.788 --> 01:23:34.581
That'll give us more time.

01:23:35.124 --> 01:23:36.458
Hey, honey!

01:23:40.337 --> 01:23:43.299
Uncle Bob, is it really you?
How nice to see you.

01:23:43.674 --> 01:23:46.343
No, it can't be Uncle Bob. It's got to be...

01:23:46.885 --> 01:23:49.014
...Aunt Pauline or Cousin Molly...

01:23:49.139 --> 01:23:50.849
...or something, right?

01:23:52.183 --> 01:23:54.019
Wait a minute! I got it!

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:59.399
This must be Cindy D'Amato. Used to
work for Super Mac. Quit to get married.

01:24:00.358 --> 01:24:02.485
Hi. How the hell are you?

01:24:11.203 --> 01:24:13.623
<i>What in heaven's name
have you got there?</i>

01:24:13.706 --> 01:24:17.335
<i>You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.</i>

01:24:18.044 --> 01:24:21.797
<i>- Give me that nonsensical object. Give it...
- You keep away from me.</i>

01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:24.008
<i>Don't you try to intimidate me.</i>

01:24:24.925 --> 01:24:26.719
<i>You are not going to tell Carol.</i>

01:24:26.802 --> 01:24:27.887
<i>Swear you won't!</i>

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.722
<i>I'll swear nothing!</i>

01:24:56.751 --> 01:24:58.044
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:09.764 --> 01:25:11.266
We're from Sherry's.

01:25:11.517 --> 01:25:12.935
Where's Francine?

01:25:13.018 --> 01:25:15.562
Francine's sick today, so Sherry sent us.

01:25:16.188 --> 01:25:17.523
They said Francine was coming.

01:25:17.606 --> 01:25:21.151
I guess they got it wrong
'cause Francine's sick. I don't know.

01:25:21.235 --> 01:25:24.238
Sherry sent us
'cause Francine ate something bad.

01:25:25.614 --> 01:25:27.116
She got sick.

01:25:27.658 --> 01:25:31.120
I could really care less
if I did another head of hair today.

01:25:31.203 --> 01:25:32.789
So make up your mind.

01:25:39.296 --> 01:25:40.839
All right. Come on.

01:25:47.345 --> 01:25:49.597
Who are these people? Where's Francine?

01:25:49.681 --> 01:25:51.224
Francine's sick, so we're here.

01:25:51.308 --> 01:25:54.645
Great. Some new fucking blood.
Can you do me out here?

01:25:54.812 --> 01:25:57.148
Sure. I can burn hair anywhere.

01:25:57.273 --> 01:25:58.566
Is this outfit all right?

01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:00.234
- Is the stain gone?
- Yes.

01:26:00.318 --> 01:26:02.945
Fine. Put it in my room with the red boots.

01:26:04.655 --> 01:26:07.283
I want some fucking softness
around my face.

01:26:07.616 --> 01:26:10.453
Last time Francine did me,
she slicked all my hair back...

01:26:10.536 --> 01:26:13.498
...and made me look like
some kind of fucking dyke.

01:26:14.374 --> 01:26:16.335
Did you guys meet my friends?

01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:20.297
This is "Stupid"
and the other one is "Stupider."

01:26:24.259 --> 01:26:27.554
- Would you like some ginseng tea?
- No, I don't drink tea.

01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:33.352
Francine says you love her ginseng tea.
It's great for the sex drive.

01:26:33.436 --> 01:26:36.022
I've got no trouble in that department.

01:26:36.105 --> 01:26:37.482
It's really very good.

01:26:37.565 --> 01:26:40.360
Enough with the fucking tea,
for Christ's sake.

01:26:41.778 --> 01:26:43.154
Suit yourself.

01:26:44.447 --> 01:26:47.325
- Do you have silk, please, for my fingers?
- Sure.

01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:12.309
Oh, God! I'm dead!

01:27:13.352 --> 01:27:15.563
- Let me see.
- Damn it, I'm hit!

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.190
It's okay.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:21.403
Hold still. Just push it hard.

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:22.904
I'm calling Kaufman.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.490
- I'm calling Kaufman.
- I can finish it. I have to!

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:28.952
He said if anything goes wrong,
we're supposed to call him.

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:34.749
It's screwed up.
There are two down and I'm hit.

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:36.627
How?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.922
Okay, okay. Yes, okay.

01:27:42.842 --> 01:27:44.802
They're calling in a cleaner.

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:46.095
Jesus!

01:28:04.948 --> 01:28:07.993
We've heard reports of shots.
Did you hear anything?

01:28:14.458 --> 01:28:16.376
I'm Victor. I'm the cleaner.

01:28:24.636 --> 01:28:27.889
The job's gone bad,
but I think I can finish it.

01:28:28.514 --> 01:28:30.391
This part of the job's over.

01:28:31.559 --> 01:28:32.894
I'm the cleaner.

01:28:36.022 --> 01:28:37.608
Where's the material?

01:28:37.941 --> 01:28:39.193
Outside.

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:49.411
What's that for?

01:28:51.038 --> 01:28:52.665
Cleaning up your shit.

01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:04.469
Christ! What're you doing?

01:29:09.307 --> 01:29:10.558
She's not dead.

01:29:12.394 --> 01:29:16.773
Oh, God! Kaufman said no wetworks.
He said no wetworks. I'll call him now.

01:29:32.498 --> 01:29:35.126
"I never did mind about the little things."

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.342
I'll go get ready for the next step.

01:30:00.153 --> 01:30:01.988
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

01:30:04.073 --> 01:30:06.159
All right, have a nice evening.

01:30:33.062 --> 01:30:33.937
Hi, Angela.

01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:37.566
<i>- New driver?
- For Christ's sake, open the stupid gate!</i>

01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:46.368
It went off the tracks
and I called in a cleaner.

01:30:46.743 --> 01:30:47.869
What happened?

01:30:47.952 --> 01:30:52.749
<i>Two down. I was afraid we'd get splashed
with shit. I told him to get it cleaned up.</i>

01:30:53.124 --> 01:30:55.043
<i>- How clean?
- Down to the nap.</i>

01:30:55.293 --> 01:30:58.129
The cleaner's going
with your girl to Bahktiar's.

01:30:59.297 --> 01:31:00.840
After she finishes...

01:31:01.634 --> 01:31:03.302
...he'll clean her, too.

01:31:24.658 --> 01:31:27.411
Of course, it was me.
I heard the bloody thing.

01:31:29.162 --> 01:31:30.789
He's upstairs. You're early.

01:31:30.872 --> 01:31:33.291
- So sue me, stupid.
- Want a drink?

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:35.669
Salty Dog. Leave it down here.

01:31:35.836 --> 01:31:37.004
I must piss.

01:31:50.685 --> 01:31:53.646
Go to your computer,
bring up your nuclear program.

01:31:55.231 --> 01:31:57.775
What are you going to accomplish by this?

01:31:57.859 --> 01:31:58.860
Do it!

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:02.572
Suck my dick.

01:32:07.661 --> 01:32:09.204
Go to your computer.

01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:21.925
Should the Arabs be the only people
not to have this technology?

01:32:22.217 --> 01:32:23.928
Is that what you think?

01:32:26.765 --> 01:32:27.849
Hurry up.

01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:35.148
I cannot access the data.

01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:36.441
Yeah, right.

01:32:36.733 --> 01:32:37.859
The system is down.

01:32:37.942 --> 01:32:40.487
Get around to the other side of the desk.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.409
I can make you very rich,
beyond anything you can imagine.

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:48.871
And if I say I will, I will.
I'll do it, I promise.

01:32:54.919 --> 01:32:56.462
What's the password?

01:32:59.715 --> 01:33:01.258
What's the password?

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.350
Try to imagine what a bullet
in the stomach feels like.

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:15.315
Peddler.

01:33:41.968 --> 01:33:45.930
You can't park there. Move it around
to the back with the other cars.

01:33:48.183 --> 01:33:50.436
Are you deaf? Move the car!

01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:23.762
On the ground.

01:34:24.512 --> 01:34:27.975
Don't be a stupid bitch.
I'm offering you anything you want.

01:34:28.059 --> 01:34:31.812
Get on your knees, forehead to the ground,
hands behind your back.

01:34:34.482 --> 01:34:36.567
You think killing me will solve anything?

01:34:36.651 --> 01:34:40.613
You think you can keep 800 million people
in the 14th century forever?

01:36:02.115 --> 01:36:04.159
That's it. I've had it.

01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:09.561
Be sure it's hooked up.

01:39:09.978 --> 01:39:11.897
Wait till he gets down there.

01:39:13.107 --> 01:39:14.775
Is there a woman down there?

01:39:14.858 --> 01:39:19.197
There could be 20 women down there,
for all I know. The car's in a bad spot.

01:39:21.491 --> 01:39:22.659
That's it.

01:39:57.362 --> 01:39:58.530
You awake?

01:40:03.535 --> 01:40:06.705
I know you are. I can tell
by the way you're breathing.

01:40:11.376 --> 01:40:12.878
I'm so tired.

01:40:16.548 --> 01:40:17.717
My God!

01:40:19.552 --> 01:40:21.387
What happened to your face?

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:13.566
She's gone.

01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:15.652
Where?

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:21.575
Where?

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:23.077
I don't know.

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:25.997
She took off empty-handed.

01:41:26.789 --> 01:41:29.875
She didn't take any of her clothes
or even her purse.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.086
So whoever it is you are...

01:41:32.962 --> 01:41:35.297
...just leave her alone. Let her go.

01:41:35.464 --> 01:41:37.967
- I can't. She's got information.
- Yeah.

01:41:40.679 --> 01:41:42.305
Why don't you get out?

01:41:44.558 --> 01:41:46.101
She left you a note.

01:41:47.519 --> 01:41:48.562
Yeah?

01:41:50.105 --> 01:41:51.481
I tore it up.

01:41:53.025 --> 01:41:54.401
What did it say?

01:42:02.535 --> 01:42:04.037
Can I take this?

01:42:05.496 --> 01:42:06.664
Yeah, sure.

01:42:09.584 --> 01:42:10.835
You like Nina?

01:42:13.838 --> 01:42:14.881
Yeah.

01:42:16.966 --> 01:42:18.176
I love her.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.934
We'll miss her.

01:42:35.027 --> 01:42:36.362
We'll miss her.

01:43:59.449 --> 01:44:01.617
We had a bad car wreck last night.

01:44:02.452 --> 01:44:03.786
No, no... no.

01:44:04.621 --> 01:44:06.874
I have all the information we need.

01:44:09.043 --> 01:44:10.627
The cleaner's dead...

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.300
...and the girl is...

01:44:21.805 --> 01:44:23.223
...the girl is...

01:44:25.101 --> 01:44:26.811
...the girl's dead, too.

01:44:27.228 --> 01:44:28.229
Yeah.
