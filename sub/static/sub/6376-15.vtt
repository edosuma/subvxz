00:07.073 --> 00:08.301
Hey!

00:13.113 --> 00:16.207
Okay, no hat today, then.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.376
Sorry, it was an accident.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.943
Please, I was getting that thing
off her head one way or another.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.113
Does anyone know
where my computer is?

00:22.155 --> 00:23.417
It's not in my bag.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.447
Oh, I used it last night.
I think it's on the couch.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.483
- Couch.
Justin, please, sit.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.495
- Have some breakfast.
- Too late.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.587
Since we've been staying
with Aunt Betty,

00:30.630 --> 00:32.530
it takes me a month
to get to school in Queens.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.192
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
my big meeting
with the Lady Gaga people is today.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.799
- Oh, my God!
- Only one more week

00:38.838 --> 00:40.738
until you get
to meet your favorite pop star.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.505
Oh, my God, Aunt Betty,
I am clinging to that.

00:44.944 --> 00:47.412
- Now I feel bad about that hat.
- Don't worry.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.937
- Bye.
- Bye, I love you.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.609
Bye.

00:50.650 --> 00:53.244
Thank you so much for doing that.
He's been so down lately.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.119
No problem. His house burnt down.
That's a lot for a kid.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.420
Where is my computer?
He said couch, right?

00:58.458 --> 01:00.255
You know what? I used it after him.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.887
I was e-mailing clients
to get them to come here.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.898
What? You're... You're...
You're taking clients here?

01:05.932 --> 01:08.992
Yeah! That way I can charge
Manhattan prices. That's cool, right?

01:09.035 --> 01:13.335
Yeah, whatever you need. Just,
you know, use that hair-catchy thingy.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.398
Old plumbing. Did you find it?

01:15.442 --> 01:19.071
I think I put your computer
on one of the suitcases. Check Justin's.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.342
Oh! And I packed a lunch for you.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.342
Ah! Yes! Here it is.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.477
<i>Sorry, mi hija.</i>

01:26.519 --> 01:28.487
We're making life so hard for you,
aren't we?

01:28.521 --> 01:33.151
<i>Papi, stop. Come on, it's nothing.
This is fun. All right, I've got to go.</i>

01:42.135 --> 01:44.626
- Betty!
- Daniel! Hey!

01:45.205 --> 01:49.642
- What are you doing here like that?
- I, you know, slept here.

01:49.809 --> 01:54.303
You know, Amanda and I
kind of have this casual thing going.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.510
No strings, no drama. It's nice.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.685
That's great.

01:59.719 --> 02:03.382
So, how's everything going over there
with your whole family?

02:03.423 --> 02:05.550
It's got to be pretty rough, huh?

02:05.592 --> 02:07.958
Yeah, it's... Got its challenges.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.656
You know, nothing I can't handle
until the insurance check comes in

02:10.697 --> 02:12.255
and we can start to rebuild.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.789
Can we talk about this later
when you have pants on?

02:14.834 --> 02:16.529
- Of course.
- Great.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.763
I need you
to oversee the Marchesa test shoot.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.640
Get Daniel's thoughts and then bring it
to me so I can do the real work.

02:23.676 --> 02:27.009
Got it. Fake notes from Daniel.
Real notes from you.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.439
Why did we stop?
Did you break a heel?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.849
Did I step in your shadow again?

02:33.019 --> 02:36.011
Don. Donald Jones.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.024
Wanda? Is that you?

02:39.058 --> 02:43.620
- Yes! Well, it's... It's Wilhelmina now.
- Right. Of course.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.363
Hi, I'm Marc St...

02:46.599 --> 02:50.467
You look terrific.
Twenty-five years later.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.062
How long you in town for?

02:53.106 --> 02:55.074
Actually, I moved here
about a year ago.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.939
A year ago?
You should have called me.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.410
Oh! I don't know about that.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.278
We're not quite the same people
we were back then.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.182
Well, I am. Same old regular guy.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.451
But you,
you've gotten quite a reputation.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.353
What was it they said about you
in the paper the other day?

03:10.390 --> 03:12.688
They called you
a "power-hungry fashion Nazi. "

03:14.928 --> 03:17.089
But that's a good thing
in your business though, right?

03:17.130 --> 03:19.360
Yes, we were very proud of that.

03:19.399 --> 03:23.130
You know, I am still
the same old Wanda I used to be.

03:23.169 --> 03:29.836
Still fun, still sweet.
Hey! This is all for show.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.112
You should...
You should call me. You'll see.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.737
Um...

03:36.883 --> 03:38.817
I'll check my schedule.

03:41.187 --> 03:42.347
Marc.

03:54.601 --> 03:55.898
Justin!

03:55.935 --> 03:57.903
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

03:57.937 --> 04:01.737
Um, I need to talk to you. In private.
Is my Aunt Betty here yet?

04:02.875 --> 04:05.275
- No. About 10 minutes away.
- Good.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.837
I have to tell you something huge,

04:07.880 --> 04:11.111
but you have to promise
not to tell any of my family, okay?

04:11.150 --> 04:12.276
Okay.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.153
It's about something that I did.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.355
With a friend from acting class.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.683
Oh.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.088
Yes. Yes. Sit down.

04:25.698 --> 04:30.726
Take your time and let it out.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.034
These things can be difficult.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.570
Trust me, I know. It wasn't too long ago

04:37.610 --> 04:40.670
that yours truly sat down with
his sympathetic cheerleading coach

04:40.713 --> 04:42.305
and had a very similar conversation.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.509
No way.
You burned down your house, too?

04:44.550 --> 04:47.348
Boy, did I.
I'm sorry, what?

04:49.155 --> 04:53.148
I smoked a cigarette in my house
and I think I started the fire.

04:57.997 --> 05:01.455
Thank you for coming over.
I really need to talk.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.526
Yeah, what's up? You're stress cooking

05:03.569 --> 05:05.696
and your shoulders are all the way up
by your moustache.

05:05.738 --> 05:08.434
Yeah, I think I did a terrible thing.

05:09.008 --> 05:13.445
I promised Hilda I'd hire an electrician
to hang my classy new chandelier...

05:14.580 --> 05:16.377
But when you hired Sal, the electrician,

05:16.416 --> 05:18.213
it turned out to be Sally,
the electrici-Anna,

05:18.251 --> 05:19.946
and you two had a steamy love affair.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.510
But little did you know
Sally was married

05:21.554 --> 05:23.488
and now her hubby's coming
to get you!

05:23.523 --> 05:25.718
No. That's not it at all.

05:25.758 --> 05:28.522
Are you sure? 'Cause I totally thought
that's where you were going with that.

05:28.561 --> 05:29.994
I need more bacon.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.260
No, no, no, no,
I never hired an electrician.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.928
I did the wiring myself and I think
I may have caused our house fire.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.570
<i>Uncle Papi!</i>

05:52.919 --> 05:56.446
Okay, I need to ask you something
and you have to tell me the truth.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.855
I'm all about the truth, all right?
Ask away.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.724
- Did you burn down my house?
- What?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.660
What the hell kind of question is that?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.062
- No!
- I'm sorry, it was rude.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.892
Did your family burn down my house?

06:10.336 --> 06:11.997
You implying
what I think you're implying?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.972
Well, Bobby,
don't you think it is a little bit weird

06:14.006 --> 06:18.102
that my salon went up in flames
just two days after I joked

06:18.144 --> 06:20.840
that the stupid place should burn down
so I could collect the insurance?

06:20.880 --> 06:26.375
Listen to me, for the last time, okay?
My family is not in the Mafia.

06:27.487 --> 06:31.218
Well, that's not the story
on the street, Mobby.

06:32.258 --> 06:36.957
I'm going to pretend, right,
that you didn't just call me "Mobby. "

06:38.097 --> 06:39.189
And you know what else?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.200
Accusing my family
of something like that

06:41.234 --> 06:42.861
when you haven't even met them yet,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.837
you know,
that takes a big fat set of kiwis.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.969
Hi. Good morning.
Could you just hold this? Thanks.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.348
- Did you just get here?
- What makes you say that?

06:58.384 --> 06:59.851
Well, Amanda, it's 11:30.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.717
Big whoop,
I'm filling in at reception today.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.587
Besides, I'm sleeping with the boss,
so it's all okay.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.354
- Oh, how's that going for you?
- It is so good.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.123
The sex is great
and he doesn't mind if I date.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.155
And I don't mind
that he's picking out models at 1:00.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.066
Ooh, he is? Hmm, this is fun.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.375
That's the jackass who upstaged me
at Fashion Week.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.645
- What's he doing here?
- Decorating my world.

07:31.684 --> 07:32.810
I don't know what it is,
there's something

07:32.852 --> 07:34.479
that bugs the hell out of me about him.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.114
Do me a favor? Find out why he's here.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.350
On it.

07:43.262 --> 07:49.167
A recent study found that over 50%
of American women wear glasses.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.693
And because Lady Gaga
is so well-known

07:51.737 --> 07:53.568
for her outlandish eyewear,

07:53.606 --> 07:55.767
we thought she would be
the perfect model

07:55.808 --> 07:59.608
<i>for Mode's top list
of fashion-forward prescription glasses.</i>

07:59.645 --> 08:03.445
We're calling the spread
"Lady Gaga's Lady Goggles. "

08:05.751 --> 08:08.618
No, we're not. We're not.

08:08.654 --> 08:13.250
Betty, less talking, more pictures.
Show us the mock-ups, please?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.561
Ew. Ew.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.523
Sorry. My...

08:20.566 --> 08:21.658
My dessert.

08:21.701 --> 08:25.637
My dad, he... He packed my dessert

08:25.671 --> 08:30.108
and it must have gotten wedged
in my computer.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.046
- He likes to do that.
- Stop. We're nauseated.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.782
Okay. Still works. Yay.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.481
All right, so as you see,
the angle for the spread is...

08:55.835 --> 08:59.271
What is that? And why is it singing?

09:00.273 --> 09:05.506
I don't know. My nephew
was using my computer earlier and...

09:05.545 --> 09:10.175
This isn't working,
the flan is making it sticky. I'm sorry.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.318
My nephew must have replaced
my Lady Gaga file

09:13.352 --> 09:14.614
with his Lady Gaga file,

09:14.654 --> 09:17.487
but, you know what,
I can run to grab my flash drive.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.785
Enough!

09:19.091 --> 09:22.993
Gentlemen, let's give Betty five minutes
to go get her flash drive

09:23.029 --> 09:27.591
so she can give it to Tracy,
who will be taking over this account.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.074
Sorry, guys, you've got to go.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.197
Hello?

10:06.505 --> 10:07.563
Oh.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.074
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.736
- Need some help?
- Yes, I'm Betty Suarez.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.210
There was a fire at my family's home.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.645
I called the insurance company to see
when the check would be coming

10:15.681 --> 10:18.309
and they said they can't send it
until you determine the cause.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.410
Yeah, that's right here.
It's right over here.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.254
- Let me see, Suarez?
- Betty.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.118
Suarez.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.091
Yeah, okay,
it looks like the report was filed today.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.655
Oh! Great! So then we'll be getting
the check soon?

10:34.133 --> 10:37.830
I'm... I'm... I'm kidding you.
This is... It's a takeout menu.

10:37.903 --> 10:38.927
- Oh.
- You said your name

10:38.971 --> 10:40.666
was Betty Salami, right?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.675
No, I have no idea
if your report was filed.

10:44.710 --> 10:48.510
- Oh. Well, can I find out?
- Yeah, I could check.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.175
- Yeah, that would be great.
- I'm Jimmy, by the way.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.844
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hey.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.649
Uh... Oh. Looks like your house
is on the bottom of the list.

10:57.690 --> 10:58.748
Oh.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.954
Well, is there any way
to speed things up?

11:01.994 --> 11:04.861
Well, I'm the captain.
I can make anything happen.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.421
Really? Great!

11:08.734 --> 11:12.295
- I'm not the captain.
- You're not the captain.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.331
But if you keep falling for my jokes,
I might just fall for you.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.369
Is there anyone else here
I could talk to?

11:21.414 --> 11:24.144
Come on.
I'm sorry, I'm just playing with you.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.743
Okay, I actually have
a little bit of pull around here.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.313
All right, my aunt,
she's an assistant fire inspector.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.551
- Not falling for that one.
- No, no, no. For reals.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.081
For reals this time, okay?

11:34.126 --> 11:36.788
I could probably get you moved
to the top of the list.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.195
Maybe, I don't know, maybe you want
to grab some dinner,

11:39.231 --> 11:41.131
we could talk it over?

11:42.034 --> 11:45.595
Um... That's flattering,
but I don't think I can.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.573
Well, okay.
Well, maybe tomorrow, then?

11:48.607 --> 11:51.371
No. I just don't think it's a good idea.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.339
Well, all right.

11:55.214 --> 11:59.480
Well, good luck with everything.
Hope it all works out.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.725
Trust me, Kathy,
that hurt you more than it hurt me.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.853
Now, the only reason I am not firing you

12:09.895 --> 12:13.729
is because you finally
discovered concealer. Now get out.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.529
Wow, someone's showing restraint.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.539
See? I can be nice.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.700
But what does it matter?

12:23.142 --> 12:26.578
People still view me
as a drop-dead gorgeous fashion Nazi.

12:26.612 --> 12:30.378
It sounds like some of Don's words
are really sticking with you.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.852
Don was a great guy.
Back in the day, believe it or not,

12:33.886 --> 12:37.344
being with a simple man like that
actually appealed to me.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.823
Willie, please don't hit me
for saying this,

12:39.859 --> 12:42.054
but your face just softened.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.895
You still like him.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.693
I do.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.292
But you heard him, he's a regular guy.

12:49.335 --> 12:53.294
And I'm a monster.
I doubt he'd even get near me.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.001
But he might get near Wanda.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.569
I mean, if you really like him,

12:58.611 --> 13:02.479
maybe you ought to dust the old girl off,
take her for a spin.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.452
Thank you.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.384
Well, thanks again for lunch.

13:10.422 --> 13:14.381
And all the dinners,
and the gentleman's facial.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.691
And it's really nice to know
that I have practically no pores.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.188
- And that's a good thing.
- Well, you get that from me.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.932
I have to admit,
I kind of feel like I'm freeloading.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.700
Tyler, you're not freeloading,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.065
you're my son.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.542
Ah, this has been the nicest week.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.340
- Now go.
- Okay.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.816
I'll see you tonight.

13:41.854 --> 13:46.348
- I am freaking.
- Amanda, what are you doing?

13:46.392 --> 13:50.055
He is your son?
And he is hot. Well done.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.960
- When are you gonna tell Daniel?
- In time.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.763
I just want to enjoy this a little longer
before it gets complicated.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.531
- So is he gonna live here with us?
- I don't know, Amanda.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.335
Apparently he was raised
with a very strong work ethic.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.773
- He won't stay here without a job.
- Weird.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.038
I know! He can be
one of our in-house test models.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.446
Oh, he's perfect. Look at that skin.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.581
He gets that from me.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.015
Really?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.583
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.727
Are you in a good mood?
Because I need to ask you a favor.

14:24.763 --> 14:28.062
Actually, I'm in a terrible mood.
I've had a horrible day.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.534
Oh. Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.094
I need to use your apartment
for a dinner party.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.766
- Why would that cheer me up?
- I know it's a lot to ask,

14:36.809 --> 14:40.336
but I promised Bobby that I would get
to know his family, you know?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.506
So I don't think they're in the Mob.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.142
Oh, well, now that I know
it's for something totally reasonable...

14:45.184 --> 14:48.085
I'm sorry, but you know
we'll be out of your apartment soon.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.487
Not unless I go out
with the world's most irritating fireman.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.649
What do you mean?

14:52.958 --> 14:56.155
So you go on one date with this guy
and we'll move to the top of the list?

14:56.195 --> 14:57.787
- You're going.
- No, I'm not.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.888
What is the big deal?

14:58.931 --> 15:00.762
It's one slice of pizza
and a little over-the-sweater.

15:00.799 --> 15:01.857
Ew!

15:01.901 --> 15:03.198
What? Do you want us out of here
or not?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.328
Hilda, I'm not that kind of girl.

15:05.371 --> 15:06.702
Hey! I'm in the shower!

15:24.490 --> 15:26.151
Hey, you.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.126
They always come back.

15:35.834 --> 15:39.133
- You're going on a date with a fireman?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.136
Betty, these are firemen.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.840
This is you.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.442
Well, Marc, maybe if you could get
a date with a real fireman,

15:52.484 --> 15:53.542
you wouldn't need the calendar.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.281
Mean. I love it!

15:57.222 --> 16:00.783
Besides, my fireman
isn't exactly chiseled.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.693
Or hairless. Or coated in oil.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.594
How does he fight fires, then?

16:05.631 --> 16:08.964
Oh, I get it.
He's one of these February firemen,

16:09.001 --> 16:12.061
the ones they make pose with dogs
'cause they're not cute enough.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.595
I guess.
I don't even want to go on this date.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.076
I'm only doing it so that my family
can get back into their house quicker.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.136
Well, if you want to make the date
quick and painless, yet effective,

16:21.180 --> 16:24.877
then you need to implement
my S.A.A.D.D. System.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.545
- "Sad" system?
- Saad-d.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.383
"Skip Appetizers And Don't Drink. "

16:29.421 --> 16:30.854
Appetizers only prolong a meal

16:30.889 --> 16:34.882
and alcohol is a gateway
to endless conversation.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.590
And other things
which I'm sure you want to avoid.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.491
- I do.
- Yes.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.227
Marc, in my office now.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.132
Oh, Wilhelmina? I hate to ask this

16:44.169 --> 16:46.262
because I know you kicked me off
the Lady Gaga account,

16:46.305 --> 16:50.173
but is it okay if my nephew still comes
to the shoot?

16:50.642 --> 16:52.473
- Marc, tell her no.
- No.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.537
And throw away her bagel,
she doesn't need it.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.852
No. No, no, no, no, no.
You're smouthing again.

17:02.888 --> 17:04.946
- Smouthing?
- Smiling with your mouth.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.617
It's a very common mistake.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.626
But if you're going to be
our new test model,

17:08.660 --> 17:10.388
you must learn to smeyes.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.226
Smile with my eyes?

17:12.263 --> 17:14.561
Now you're getting it.

17:15.134 --> 17:18.262
- Can I confess something to you?
- What?

17:18.303 --> 17:19.599
That you're Claire Meade's
long-lost son

17:19.637 --> 17:22.071
that she put up for adoption and you've
come to claim your rightful place,

17:22.107 --> 17:23.597
since the revelation
of your true birth mother

17:23.642 --> 17:25.973
rocked your tiny small-town world?

17:26.011 --> 17:28.309
Wow. I mean, I was just gonna say

17:28.347 --> 17:30.781
that I'm not really qualified
to be a model, but, yeah.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.807
How did you know?

17:32.851 --> 17:35.411
I think I'm kind of Claire's bestie.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.922
They don't have girls like you
in South Dakota.

17:39.958 --> 17:43.155
Oh, honey, they don't have girls
like me anywhere.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.689
You're free tonight? Great!

17:47.766 --> 17:49.893
Um... Well, why don't we go to Remi?

17:49.935 --> 17:52.961
You know, they always have a table
for me there, and...

17:53.005 --> 17:57.499
Or... Or... What... You know what?
Why don't you pick the place?

17:57.543 --> 18:01.377
Mmm-hmm.
Well, you know, I'm... I'm easy breezy.

18:02.247 --> 18:07.844
Yes, easy breezy, George and Weezy.
That's... Um, you know what?

18:08.287 --> 18:11.654
Okay. Why don't I send my car
to pick you up and...

18:11.824 --> 18:17.194
Or you can pick me up in a cab

18:17.229 --> 18:19.493
because that's what people do.

18:21.066 --> 18:24.194
Great. I'll see you later.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.599
And you thought you couldn't be nice.

18:28.674 --> 18:32.508
Get Kathy back in here.
I need to kick someone.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.176
Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.084
So, why is he here?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.147
Oh, um,
he is one of our new test models.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.852
Wait, no, that's impossible.
I'm the one who hires the models.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.157
Oh! Oh, that's weird.
That's a total mystery.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.355
Maybe one of those things
we'll never know,

18:51.396 --> 18:54.160
like what water's made of,
or who invented canned potato chips.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.030
No, really. Did Wilhelmina hire him?

18:56.068 --> 19:01.597
No. But who cares? I want you. Now.
And far from this location.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.808
But, no, wait.
Okay, so that only leaves my mother.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.470
Why would my...

19:06.512 --> 19:10.278
For once can we not talk
about your mother when we have sex?

19:14.953 --> 19:17.421
Okay, the Talercios are on their way up.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.254
Remember, no cracks about them
being in the Mob.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.886
So what if they are?
Who am I to judge?

19:22.928 --> 19:26.329
People do things they wish they hadn't.
Unforgivable things.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.162
Okay, I don't know
what any of that means.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.565
Hey, they're here! Okay, remember,

19:31.603 --> 19:34.401
tonight is all about keeping
an open mind.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.963
<i>- All right, right.
- Papi, get the door!</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:38.704
- Okay. Ready?
- Yes.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.576
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.878
- We've heard so much about you!
- How are you? All good things.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.943
Yeah, yeah, so nice to see you.
Beautiful, beautiful.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.511
- Mr. Suarez, my father, Anthony.
- Ignacio.

19:50.556 --> 19:53.457
You don't want to shake with me,
I've got blood on my hands.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.184
- Paper cut from this damn pastry box.
Oh.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.354
But tell them how worth it it was.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.889
These are the best cannolis
in all of Brooklyn.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.903
She's right.
- I'm telling you, we'd kill for them.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.132
Yeah. She's right.

20:07.172 --> 20:08.867
- Let me take your coat.
- Sure.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.667
We'll call you.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.470
Hi.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.011
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's... It's Jimmy.</i>

20:22.187 --> 20:24.485
<i>Look, I'm sorry, I can't make it.</i>

20:24.523 --> 20:28.823
<i>There was a fire and I went in alone.
Things got really bad.</i>

20:29.127 --> 20:31.061
- Oh, no.
- Got you!

20:33.031 --> 20:34.726
Damn, you're easy.

20:37.502 --> 20:40.562
Look, it's like an hour wait for a table.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.172
That's no problem,
we'll get some appetizers

20:42.207 --> 20:43.868
and booze at the bar. Boom!

20:44.443 --> 20:47.503
"Skip Appetizers And Don't Drink. "
Saad-d.

20:47.813 --> 20:53.649
No! I mean, let's just go down the street
and grab, like, a quick falafel.

20:53.685 --> 20:57.348
It's, like, 10 degrees out.
Come on, an hour with me, it'll fly by.

21:00.525 --> 21:05.428
So, Jimmy, about my house,
have you spoken to your aunt?

21:05.464 --> 21:08.024
I have not had the chance yet.
I will call her right after dinner.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.829
Okay, let's just enjoy ourselves.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.460
Oh! Sorry.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.169
- Wilhelmina.
- Betty.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.197
You two know each other?

21:16.341 --> 21:20.072
Uh, yes. Betty is a friend from work.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.440
What a surprise.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.473
Yeah, uh... Okay.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.051
We're just gonna hang out at the bar
till our table's ready.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.112
Oh, that's too bad.
We were just being seated.

21:31.156 --> 21:32.919
Otherwise, we'd have a drink with you.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.993
Ah, timing.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.420
Who runs this joint?

21:37.462 --> 21:39.259
They're gonna make us wait
in the bar for an hour

21:39.298 --> 21:41.061
and you guys get a big comfy booth?

21:41.099 --> 21:42.225
Jimmy.

21:42.267 --> 21:45.498
Well, why don't you just join us?

21:45.537 --> 21:47.903
I don't mind, she's your friend.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.707
She's my friend. Yes. Betty, join us.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.536
I can't think of anything more fun.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.119
- Here you are.
- Oh! The Scorpion.

22:06.992 --> 22:13.693
- Here's to new and old friends.
- And to hot babes, right?

22:15.534 --> 22:18.298
Come on, jump in.
Don't leave us hanging.

22:20.539 --> 22:23.906
Here's to friends and hot babes!

22:29.548 --> 22:34.178
Mmm. That is so good.
Maybe we should each get our own.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.379
- Yeah.
- Oh, no,

22:35.420 --> 22:37.547
there's a hair in the Scorpion bowl.

22:37.589 --> 22:40.023
- That's disgusting.
- Are you sure?

22:40.058 --> 22:42.185
- He's joking.
- I'm joking. There's no hair.

22:42.227 --> 22:45.424
- There's no hair.
- See? She gets me. I love that.

22:46.865 --> 22:51.700
- So, how do you two know each other?
- Oh, we go way, way back, back.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.673
I knew this one before she was
the famous Wilhelmina Slater.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.074
To be honest,
I'd be afraid to go out with that woman.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.776
I read somewhere
that she put out a memo

23:01.813 --> 23:04.281
firing anyone with a visible mole.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.351
Well, haters love to hate. Yeah.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.720
So tell me, you're her buddy.

23:14.025 --> 23:17.119
Is she still the sweet girl I remember?

23:20.766 --> 23:24.099
Bobby told us about the fire.
It's a terrible thing.

23:24.369 --> 23:25.563
Excuse me.

23:25.604 --> 23:26.866
Yeah, but on the bright side,

23:26.905 --> 23:28.839
you're gonna be getting
a big insurance check

23:28.874 --> 23:32.332
and you can buy some really
nice upgrades for your salon.

23:32.377 --> 23:35.574
I guess.
But I didn't really want upgrades.

23:35.614 --> 23:38.583
Hilda's Beautilities Plus
was doing just fine.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.142
Yeah, but still,
don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.551
- You're right.
- It's interesting,

23:42.587 --> 23:44.748
your son said "gift horse," too.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.054
I tend to look at it
as a loss to my livelihood,

23:47.092 --> 23:49.583
but then again, I can go negative, so...

23:49.628 --> 23:53.428
You know, Mr. S, I was thinking...

23:53.732 --> 23:55.859
- Oh, that looks good.
... when you rebuild,

23:55.901 --> 23:58.267
marble floors would look great
in the house. Hmm?

23:58.303 --> 24:01.170
Especially with that
new crystal chandelier you got.

24:01.206 --> 24:04.107
- Crystal. Oh, very fancy.
Yeah.

24:04.142 --> 24:07.703
Yeah, well, it's not really me.
I'm a simple man.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.879
- I may even get rid of it.
- Why?

24:11.016 --> 24:14.850
What are you talking about? No way,
come on, this guy loves this chandelier.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.012
- It's true.
Well, listen,

24:16.054 --> 24:18.716
if you decide you wanna go
with marble, you let me know.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.725
I can get you a deal.
We've got family in construction.

24:20.759 --> 24:23.990
Really? You have family
in construction?

24:24.029 --> 24:25.155
Yeah.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.060
I've got to get this. Excuse me.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.659
Come here a second.

24:31.703 --> 24:33.637
What happened
to keeping an open mind?

24:33.672 --> 24:35.697
Okay, all right, open mind.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.105
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:46.117 --> 24:49.883
<i>I don't speak Italian,
but "morte" means "death," right?</i>

24:49.921 --> 24:52.219
- Very good.
Ah, he's talking to his brother.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.691
You ever get mad enough at someone
you tell them, "I'm gonna kill you"?

24:54.726 --> 24:56.523
It's just... It's an expression.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.586
No, no.
You don't understand.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.154
I'm really gonna kill you.

25:05.303 --> 25:08.238
Look, you're gonna hear
what you want to hear.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.098
Wilhelmina is so supportive of all of us.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.975
You know,
if someone is having a problem,

25:14.012 --> 25:16.071
she's probably involved.

25:16.114 --> 25:19.982
And if there are tears, she's there.

25:21.219 --> 25:25.315
Well, that's right. Just this morning,
Kathy was in my office crying.

25:25.357 --> 25:29.555
And I just rocked her
and gave her some makeup tips.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.626
Aw. Sounds like you guys
have a great time at work.

25:32.664 --> 25:35.656
Well, it's not work.
It's... It's really like a family.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.033
- Isn't it, Betty?
- Right.

25:41.339 --> 25:42.363
You know what?

25:42.407 --> 25:47.106
Just yesterday I totally screwed up
a pitch to Lady Gaga's people.

25:47.145 --> 25:50.205
And, you know, another boss would
have just taken me off the project.

25:50.248 --> 25:54.184
But Wilhelmina?
She was just like, "Try again, girl. "

25:55.687 --> 25:58.679
That's right, girl. Try again.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.953
And you know what the best part is?

26:01.993 --> 26:06.327
My nephew, Justin, he still gets
to meet Lady Gaga, who he loves.

26:06.364 --> 26:08.958
Almost as much
as he loves Wilhelmina Slater.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.592
You know
what would be such a cool thing?

26:12.637 --> 26:16.129
Is if Wilhelmina called Justin
and told him the news!

26:16.174 --> 26:19.234
- Yeah. Call him. He'll love that.
Yeah.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.574
- Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

26:22.614 --> 26:25.481
- Call him! Call him! Call him!
- Do it, Willie! Do it, Willie! Do it, Willie!

26:25.517 --> 26:27.348
- It's ringing.
- Sorry.

26:29.487 --> 26:33.048
<i>- Hello? It's Wilhelmina Slater.
Oh, my God! Hi!</i>

26:33.091 --> 26:34.149
That's him.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.558
<i>Be at Mode Tuesday at 4:00</i>

26:36.595 --> 26:40.395
because you are going to meet
Lady Gaga.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.401
<i>Shut up! Oh, my God,</i>

26:43.435 --> 26:45.699
<i>- thank you so, so much, Wilhelmina!
- Nice talking to you!</i>

26:47.205 --> 26:50.038
- Ooh, she seems really excited.
- Thanks, Wills.

26:51.876 --> 26:56.245
Betty, why don't we go
powder our noses? Hmm?

27:00.418 --> 27:01.942
Damn, Hilda, you know,
you're not even trying.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.614
Well, I'm sorry,

27:03.655 --> 27:05.953
but every time one of them opens
their mouth, a dead body falls out.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.481
Hey, that's not funny.

27:07.525 --> 27:09.686
Come on, you know, they heard rumors
about you back in the day.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.889
Please. What rumors?

27:13.431 --> 27:16.332
You know, rumors.
Like, maybe you're not the kind of girl

27:16.368 --> 27:17.596
that their son should be going out with.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.330
I mean, at least they came here
with an open mind.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.705
Are you telling me that they're here
to decide whether or not I'm a slut?

27:23.742 --> 27:24.868
Jeez.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.042
Wilhelmina, I'm sorry.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.844
You don't have to give me back
the project.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.111
It's just that my nephew

27:33.151 --> 27:36.712
- really wants to meet Lady...
- Oh, stop apologizing, Betty.

27:36.755 --> 27:37.949
Playing the Gaga card

27:37.989 --> 27:40.958
might have been the first time
I've ever respected you.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.352
- Really?
- Now, it's time for you

27:43.395 --> 27:46.694
and your chubby municipal worker
to be on your way.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.496
Right. I'll make up an excuse
and we'll go.

27:51.469 --> 27:53.198
Not that I'm gonna lose any sleep
over it,

27:53.238 --> 27:56.036
but I'm surprised
at your choice of boyfriends.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.042
I would think
that even you could do better than that.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.600
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

27:59.644 --> 28:03.136
I just need him
to get my family's inspection moved up.

28:04.582 --> 28:08.575
Betty Suarez.
Using a man to get what she wants?

28:09.821 --> 28:14.155
- You are full of surprises tonight.
- No, it's not like that. I...

28:14.993 --> 28:19.396
There are extenuating circumstances.
This isn't really me.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.325
And yet here you are.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.567
A girl's got to do what a girl's got to do.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.066
Right?

28:34.846 --> 28:38.213
I mean, it's just weird.
Why is my mom hiring models?

28:38.249 --> 28:41.480
Everybody knows that's my job.
And why that guy?

28:41.519 --> 28:43.009
He's not even that good-looking.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.988
Okay, first of all, he's crazy hot.

28:45.023 --> 28:47.685
And second,
if you're actually done with your rant,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.559
I think I might have your answer
right here.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.461
<i>It's only February, but
it's already December for Claire Meade.</i>

28:54.499 --> 28:56.694
<i>May-December, that is.</i>

28:56.735 --> 28:59.226
<i>The menopausal Meade matriarch
has been spotted</i>

28:59.270 --> 29:02.899
<i>canoodling over noodles
with an age-inappropriate hottie.</i>

29:04.576 --> 29:08.012
<i>And we don't think his palm
is the only thing she's been greasing.</i>

29:10.048 --> 29:12.676
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I know.

29:13.351 --> 29:16.445
How does he eat pasta
and still look like that?

29:16.821 --> 29:17.879
Hey...

29:20.525 --> 29:22.117
What are you doing here?

29:24.062 --> 29:26.326
You know what? I already know.

29:26.364 --> 29:30.198
- I'm just waiting to talk to Mrs. Meade.
- Lf you think I'm gonna stand by

29:30.235 --> 29:33.295
and watch you take advantage
of my mother, you don't know me.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.169
You got it all wrong, man.

29:35.206 --> 29:38.437
I don't think so.
I think it's time for you to leave, man.

29:38.476 --> 29:42.173
- Okay, you need to calm down.
- Or what? Huh?

29:42.213 --> 29:45.239
You gonna calm me down? Get up!

29:45.283 --> 29:47.308
I don't want you ever
around my mother!

29:47.352 --> 29:50.014
- Do you...
- What the hell is going on?

29:50.188 --> 29:52.213
This guy is playing you.

29:52.257 --> 29:55.158
He's only interested in his career
and leeching off of you.

29:55.193 --> 29:57.127
Daniel, stop, you don't know
what you're talking about.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.255
Yes, I do.
Everyone has seen you together.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.733
It's embarrassing.
But it stops right now.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.634
- Are you gonna tell him or should I?
- Tell me what?

30:05.670 --> 30:08.605
- Tyler is not who you think he is.
- Who is he, then?

30:12.577 --> 30:14.272
He's your brother.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.380
Well, I hate to cut this thing short,

30:23.421 --> 30:26.151
but I did promise my dad
that we'd be home in time for dessert.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.489
He's dying to meet
one of America's heroes.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.494
- I get that all the time.
- Shall we?

30:30.528 --> 30:33.292
Hey, you know what? I've got an idea,
why don't you guys come with us?

30:33.331 --> 30:34.662
We can... We can get some dessert,

30:34.699 --> 30:38.601
we can get a couple pictures
with the old man, and then, karaoke.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.399
No, Jimmy, come on, they don't...

30:40.438 --> 30:44.067
- They don't want to.
- You know what? That sounds like fun.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.234
- What?
- What?

30:45.276 --> 30:48.143
Obviously, she doesn't want to be alone
with this guy. Let's just go back

30:48.179 --> 30:49.612
- to her house for a while.
- Because we're having fun.

30:49.647 --> 30:50.875
They don't wanna
hang out with us.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.280
Come on, she's your friend.

30:52.317 --> 30:55.775
No. Betty Suarez is not my friend.

30:55.987 --> 30:59.423
And I'm not going back to some
tenement mud hut in Little Mexico!

30:59.457 --> 31:00.583
I live in Chelsea.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.718
Don, I can't take it anymore!

31:02.760 --> 31:05.695
I'm a bitch. I'm a stone-cold bitch.

31:06.397 --> 31:09.833
My favorite moment of the day
is throwing out my breakfast muffin

31:09.868 --> 31:11.961
in front of a homeless person.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.096
Anyone who has a mole is an idiot.

31:14.138 --> 31:16.936
And everything you've read about me
is true, or it might as well be true.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.670
And as long as we're being honest,

31:18.710 --> 31:19.870
I'm starting to remember
why I really liked you.

31:21.946 --> 31:25.347
The amazing sex.
So if you want to do that again, fine.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.442
But this time, I'm on top.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.750
I'm good with that.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.597
All I'm saying
is your boss seems kind of psycho,

31:41.633 --> 31:43.066
which I did not see coming.

31:43.101 --> 31:44.898
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

31:44.936 --> 31:47.871
Like, I knew right away
that you were the girl for me.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.601
And I usually like blondes.

31:50.441 --> 31:53.672
You know what? I'm not usually the one
to be defending Wilhelmina Slater,

31:53.711 --> 31:55.702
but at least she was being honest.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.147
I mean, isn't that better
than what we're doing?

31:58.850 --> 32:00.283
What do you mean?

32:00.718 --> 32:02.379
Us on this date.

32:02.820 --> 32:03.912
I mean, I'm only here

32:03.955 --> 32:06.423
so that you can help
move my family's name up the list.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.756
Wait a minute, you're using me?
That's awful. I thought you liked me.

32:09.794 --> 32:11.591
Jimmy, come on.

32:11.896 --> 32:15.491
I mean, you basically said that
if I went out with you, you would help.

32:15.533 --> 32:18.593
- Whoa, I would never say that.
- You kind of did.

32:18.636 --> 32:22.299
You were all, like,
"My aunt's a fire inspector,"

32:22.340 --> 32:24.274
and then you got all winky and...

32:24.309 --> 32:26.209
I mean, what was that?

32:26.244 --> 32:29.145
That is my thing! It's charming!

32:29.180 --> 32:31.307
You know what?
I am America's freaking hero!

32:31.349 --> 32:33.180
I don't need any of that crap
to get a date!

32:33.217 --> 32:36.380
- Jimmy...
- Forget it. I'm not taking you back.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.754
And your family is going
to the bottom of the list!

32:44.162 --> 32:46.995
I mean, this doesn't make any sense.
Why didn't you ever tell me?

32:47.031 --> 32:50.558
It was a long time ago.
You were too young to understand.

32:50.601 --> 32:54.298
But you told us you were in rehab.
Mom, you went away for a year.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.797
I did the best I could
under the circumstances.

32:57.842 --> 33:01.073
Okay, so who's the father, huh?
Obviously it's not Dad.

33:03.281 --> 33:05.112
Don't tell me it was Hartley.

33:07.218 --> 33:09.584
You had a kid with him?

33:13.491 --> 33:16.483
- I don't believe this.
- Daniel, Daniel, please.

33:16.527 --> 33:20.463
No, no. I spent my whole life
thinking you were the victim.

33:20.498 --> 33:24.434
My relationship with Dad was crap
because I always sided with you.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.733
I never thought for a second

33:27.438 --> 33:29.906
that you were just as screwed up
as he was.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.778
This doesn't sound like you,
Justin. Why were you smoking?

33:40.818 --> 33:41.842
Look, I was only doing it

33:41.886 --> 33:44.514
to impress someone
in my acting class, though.

33:45.423 --> 33:46.447
Oh.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.783
Someone I like.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.553
Okay.

33:51.662 --> 33:53.459
So we're here again.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.558
So, you like someone.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.530
Yeah.

34:00.571 --> 34:04.530
Well, tell me about them.
What is their name?

34:07.278 --> 34:08.404
Lily.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.947
Lily, cool.

34:15.152 --> 34:17.713
Everybody okay?
Whoo! I'm really full.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.953
- Are you done with your puttanesca?
- Honey, this is not puttanesca.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.790
Well, apparently it is when I serve it.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.194
I mean, it is Italian
for "whore sauce," right?

34:26.230 --> 34:28.527
- Hilda!
- No, we're not gonna go there. Please.

34:28.565 --> 34:31.797
- Bobby, what is she talking about?
- I will tell you what I am talking about.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.896
You got some nerve, coming here
to find out what kind of person I am,

34:34.938 --> 34:36.463
when you and your Mafia family

34:36.507 --> 34:38.031
- burned down my salon.
- Wait a minute.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.565
Wait, you think
we burned down your salon?

34:39.610 --> 34:41.942
Okay.
- Tony, get the coats, we're out of here.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.606
- You understand?
- Hi, I'm Betty.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.911
- No one's going anywhere, all right?
- I am out of here. Hello.

34:45.949 --> 34:47.918
Hilda doesn't think
you burned down her salon.

34:47.952 --> 34:50.250
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
Maybe you hired someone.

34:50.288 --> 34:51.516
I don't know how these things work.

34:51.556 --> 34:52.580
- Hilda, please!
What?

34:52.623 --> 34:53.647
- What are you talking...
- What is going on?

34:53.690 --> 34:56.023
- Why is everyone yelling?
- Tony! The coats!

34:56.060 --> 34:57.118
I'll get the coats.

34:57.161 --> 35:01.757
We make it a point not to stay in places
where people think we're in the Mob.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.494
Not that that happens that often.

35:03.534 --> 35:04.660
- Ha!
No!

35:04.702 --> 35:06.169
- What, "No"?
- Okay, we're gonna figure out a way

35:06.204 --> 35:08.536
- for everybody to get along.
- That is not gonna happen.

35:08.573 --> 35:11.098
Well, it has to, Ma! This is the woman
I want to spend my life with.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.473
Oh, my God!

35:12.510 --> 35:14.102
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I've got something to say.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.544
I think Bobby is talking.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.377
I started the fire.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.439
- What?
- What?

35:19.784 --> 35:24.812
I told you guys I'd hire an electrician
for the dimmer. I did it myself.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.881
<i>- Papi!
- You could have hurt yourself!</i>

35:26.924 --> 35:28.755
Forget that! He hurt my business!

35:28.793 --> 35:30.260
Because you had to get all highfalutin

35:30.294 --> 35:32.455
- with your fancy chandelier!
- No, Mom, stop! Stop!

35:32.497 --> 35:36.866
It's not Grandpa's fault,
because I started the fire.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.936
What? Justin, what do you mean?

35:40.972 --> 35:46.103
- Well, I was smoking, and...
- You were whating?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.408
Well, at least our family doesn't smoke.

35:48.446 --> 35:52.246
Do you have any idea
what you have put us through?

35:52.283 --> 35:54.251
That's it,
you're grounded until you're dead!

35:54.285 --> 35:57.254
If you want to shave some years off
of it, keep smoking!

35:57.288 --> 35:59.950
At least now we know
that it wasn't my family.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.822
We don't know anything
about your family.

36:01.859 --> 36:04.657
Okay, please, everyone stop!

36:05.696 --> 36:08.187
It doesn't matter who started the fire.

36:08.232 --> 36:11.929
What's important is that we don't start
turning against each other.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.903
We might have to be here
a very long time,

36:13.938 --> 36:15.530
so we need to find a way
to make it work

36:15.573 --> 36:18.838
without ruining projects,
or spitting on hats,

36:18.876 --> 36:22.107
and showers being taken at all hours
of the day.

36:22.680 --> 36:27.708
Who cares if it was faulty wiring,
or smoking, or the Mob? No disrespect.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.944
- We just have to get through this.
- It was a curling iron.

36:30.988 --> 36:34.480
- Oh! Who's this guy?
- Jimmy? What?

36:34.525 --> 36:38.017
- What are you doing here?
- I was acting like a d-bag.

36:38.062 --> 36:39.859
And you were right,
I did want to go out with you.

36:39.897 --> 36:43.162
That's why I didn't tell you
that they did the inspection yesterday.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.432
So, yeah,
someone left a curling iron on.

36:47.572 --> 36:51.008
So...
- It was you! Hmm?

36:51.409 --> 36:52.433
Hmm?

36:52.810 --> 36:57.042
What? Nuh-uh.
I didn't even have clients that day.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.942
Besides, I prefer Velcro rollers.

37:01.786 --> 37:06.416
Wait, Aunt Betty, you had a curl
in your hair the day of the fire.

37:06.591 --> 37:07.717
What?

37:11.229 --> 37:15.689
<i>Hmm, if I put in two curls,
it'll really frame my face,</i>

37:15.733 --> 37:17.997
<i>but one curl
makes more of a statement.</i>

37:18.035 --> 37:21.368
<i>One or two? One or two?</i>

37:21.405 --> 37:23.168
Betty, get in here.

37:26.677 --> 37:30.238
Oh, my God. It was me.

37:33.451 --> 37:38.514
<i>Mi hija, it was an accident.
You have to stop beating yourself up.</i>

37:41.158 --> 37:43.388
I feel like a terrible person.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.362
Don't worry, I'm coming up
with a list of things you can do

37:46.397 --> 37:47.591
to make it up to us.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.465
Smokers don't get to make jokes.
Or lists.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.827
It's just, for the last two days,

37:54.805 --> 37:58.400
all I've been doing is trying
to get you guys out of my apartment.

37:58.843 --> 38:03.075
I mean, I even went on a date
with that annoying fire...

38:03.114 --> 38:05.082
Hey, watch what you say,
you little firebug.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.777
I might not take you out again.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.751
You should probably go.

38:12.256 --> 38:13.883
Leave the ladle.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.335
Hey, Amanda, it's me.

38:28.639 --> 38:32.405
Look, I really need to see you tonight.
Can... Can I come over?

38:32.877 --> 38:36.677
Daniel, I wish you could,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.011
Can I call you later when I get home?

38:38.516 --> 38:41.576
No. No, no, don't... Don't worry about it.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.917
- Are you sure?
- No, no, it's fine.

38:43.954 --> 38:46.821
I'll just, you know, see you tomorrow.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.088
How can you even talk to that guy?

38:53.130 --> 38:56.293
Okay, you had a bad moment with him,
but Daniel is really great.

38:56.734 --> 39:01.103
Well, thanks
for not ditching me tonight.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.368
I could really use a friend.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.975
Well, you've got one.

39:09.714 --> 39:14.310
Mrs. Talercio, I just want to say
one more time how sorry I am.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.444
It's all right, honey.

39:15.486 --> 39:17.477
You forget about what we said to you

39:17.521 --> 39:19.682
and we'll forget
about what you said to us.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.954
- And we'll start fresh, okay?
- Okay.

39:21.992 --> 39:23.482
- All right!
- Dina, come on, let's go!

39:23.527 --> 39:25.119
They want to make out already!

39:25.162 --> 39:27.562
- I love youse guys.
- All right, good night.

39:27.598 --> 39:30.260
- Get home safe.
- All right, I love you.

39:33.304 --> 39:36.467
- Okay, I'm glad that worked out.
- Oh, yeah?

39:37.375 --> 39:41.971
Why, because you want
to spend the rest of your life with me?

39:42.012 --> 39:46.278
Come on, I was just saying that
to calm everybody down. It's nothing.

39:48.085 --> 39:51.612
- What?
- You know what, Talercio? Forget it.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.014
Come on.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.652
No. I know that you're not the flower
and candy type of guy,

39:56.694 --> 40:02.189
but if there ever comes a day,
you'd better do it right.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.025
Hey, Hilda. Hilda, wait.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.842
I've been carrying this around
a couple of weeks.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.276
Oh, my God.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.814
You know, I figure we get through
a night like tonight,

40:20.851 --> 40:22.842
we can get through anything, right?

40:27.892 --> 40:30.019
I lost you a long time ago.

40:30.961 --> 40:32.826
I won't let that happen again.

40:35.332 --> 40:38.130
So, yes, I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.196
Hilda Suarez, I love you.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.904
Will you marry me?

40:47.878 --> 40:50.779
You did it right. Yes.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.443
Oh!

41:10.267 --> 41:13.464
Well, the good thing is
that we'll get the insurance check soon

41:13.504 --> 41:14.869
and you'll get your apartment back.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.407
<i>Oh, come on, Papi,
this has been really fun!</i>

41:17.441 --> 41:20.774
Like a slumber party that never ends.

41:24.315 --> 41:29.184
Hilda, I want you to know that I'm going
to help you repair your salon,

41:29.220 --> 41:31.211
no matter what it takes.

41:31.388 --> 41:34.482
Ah, don't worry about it. It's no biggie.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.625
- No biggie?
- Who cares about the salon?

41:38.062 --> 41:39.893
When I'm engaged!

41:42.500 --> 41:44.695
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

41:45.536 --> 41:47.163
- Really?
- Just now!

41:47.204 --> 41:49.604
Hey! Welcome to the family.
