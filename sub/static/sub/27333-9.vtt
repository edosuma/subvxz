KAROLINA:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.728 --> 00:11.607
-CATHERINE: You're gonna do
one more thing for him.
-Yeah, what's that?

00:11.690 --> 00:13.109
Take the rap for his murder charge.

00:13.986 --> 00:15.740
I have evidence that proves

00:15.823 --> 00:16.992
-someone is innocent.
-FLORES: It's an alibi.

00:17.076 --> 00:18.871
Our boy AWOL here
can destroy the footage.

00:18.955 --> 00:20.833
-Send a message.
-I'll take care of it.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.756
-[gunfire]
-[people screaming]

00:23.839 --> 00:26.052
You're gonna tell me every damn thing
you know about this mess.

00:26.135 --> 00:27.722
ALEX: Sounds like it's time for you
to meet my friends.

00:27.806 --> 00:29.643
We know that Darius was killed
at the Gordon Hotel,

00:29.726 --> 00:31.522
so if I can hack into
the surveillance system there

00:31.605 --> 00:34.068
and prove it, then we can
clear Darius's name once and for all.

00:34.151 --> 00:37.283
I was gonna tell you about that.
It's the school of my dreams.

00:37.366 --> 00:39.955
You make a decision, you lie,
and then you keep shit from me.

00:40.038 --> 00:42.251
-We gotta go! Now! Come on.
-[elevator bell dings]

00:44.005 --> 00:45.215
CHASE:
Stairs! Go!

00:47.929 --> 00:48.973
[man grunts]

00:52.396 --> 00:55.277
-She's been inside way too long.
-OK, so we're going in, right?

00:55.360 --> 00:56.446
If we go back in,
we gotta be ready to fight.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.699
-I don't know.
-GERT: What do you mean,
you don't know?

00:57.782 --> 00:59.035
-That's Molly.
-NICO: No offense,

00:59.118 --> 01:01.080
but the people who have no powers
are the ones calling the shots.

01:01.164 --> 01:03.919
I can mind-control a dinosaur.
That sounds like a power to me.

01:04.003 --> 01:05.632
And how does that help us
in this moment?

01:05.715 --> 01:07.969
Speaking as someone with
an above-average range of power,

01:08.053 --> 01:10.642
-I say we can beat their asses.
-Okay, what the hell is going on?

01:10.725 --> 01:12.436
There may have been some things
I didn't tell you about us.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.650
Yeah, no shit.
And did you say "dinosaur"?

01:14.733 --> 01:16.820
ALEX: I'll explain later, all right?
But right now, we have to save Molly.

01:16.904 --> 01:18.156
Get off me!

01:18.239 --> 01:20.369
That's AWOL.
Tamar warned me about him.

01:20.452 --> 01:21.872
-This isn't good.
-GERT: What if they lock her up?

01:21.955 --> 01:23.793
What if they feed her lies
and they brainwash her?

01:23.876 --> 01:25.295
What if she gets Stockholm Syndrome?

01:25.379 --> 01:26.799
Slow down, Gert.
She hasn't gone Patty Hearst yet.

01:28.093 --> 01:31.349
MOLLY: Thanks for the ride.
I thought I was gonna have to walk home.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.275
-Now what?
-We follow her.

01:36.359 --> 01:39.198
Somebody call Karolina.
We're gonna need all hands on deck.

01:47.339 --> 01:49.218
Shouldn't I be in a police station?

01:49.301 --> 01:52.474
AWOL: You where you're supposed to be.
In the Black Box.

01:52.559 --> 01:56.608
Made for people like you
who can't mind their business.

01:56.692 --> 02:00.157
-Oh, so you're a crooked cop.
-[chuckles]

02:00.240 --> 02:02.286
Everything's black and white
with you kids.

02:02.369 --> 02:05.793
Look, I don't make the rules,
I just enforce 'em.

02:05.877 --> 02:07.797
Shit, you're lucky they sent me.

02:07.881 --> 02:10.176
Lucky? You Tased me.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.930
My boss Flores woulda shot you.

02:12.014 --> 02:14.603
So you're one of Flores' little bitches.

02:18.318 --> 02:20.782
I'm no one's...bitch.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.244
You sure about that?

02:24.205 --> 02:26.585
[chuckles]
You know what?

02:26.668 --> 02:30.467
I like you. You're kind of tough
for a little girl.

02:34.851 --> 02:37.481
You can go.
I'll take it from here.

02:37.565 --> 02:40.237
You sure? She's strong, man.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.159
Took that Taser
like a 400-pound grizzly bear.

02:43.243 --> 02:45.038
She's also fourteen years old.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.917
Almost fifteen.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.504
Besides...

02:48.587 --> 02:52.094
Ms. Hernandez and I,
we got history.

02:52.177 --> 02:53.889
I'm an old friend of her parents'--

02:53.973 --> 02:56.269
may they rest in peace.

02:57.981 --> 03:00.277
She's harmless. Go home.

03:11.048 --> 03:12.969
[Flores sighs]

03:13.052 --> 03:15.892
You do realize your parents
are worried sick?

03:15.975 --> 03:18.522
You said it yourself.
My parents are dead.

03:19.273 --> 03:20.902
Let me get you home.

03:20.985 --> 03:23.406
You and your friends.
You can trust me.

03:24.784 --> 03:26.538
Not happening.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.211
You're just a flunky, do-boy.

03:31.047 --> 03:32.717
PRIDE owns you.

03:36.057 --> 03:39.063
-Where are your goddamn friends?
-MOLLY: I don't know, man.

03:39.146 --> 03:42.402
I mean, still at the hotel,

03:42.486 --> 03:45.241
reporting a kidnapping
to the actual cops,

03:45.325 --> 03:46.828
eating pizza, maybe.

03:46.912 --> 03:49.333
It's kind of your job to find out.

03:50.795 --> 03:54.176
There's nothing worse
than hurting a kid to get information.

03:57.558 --> 03:59.269
But I will.

04:02.819 --> 04:04.113
[Flores laughs]

04:04.196 --> 04:06.158
Oh, you won't be smiling for long.

04:07.704 --> 04:09.791
Wanna put money on that?

04:09.874 --> 04:11.460
I can use the cash.

04:14.968 --> 04:16.470
[whoosh]

04:16.512 --> 04:18.055
[upbeat rock music playing]

04:20.060 --> 04:22.190
[tires screeching]

04:29.664 --> 04:31.793
GERT: Molly, put the corrupt
law enforcement officer down.

04:31.877 --> 04:33.046
It's not worth it.

04:33.129 --> 04:34.423
Sure.

04:36.803 --> 04:38.097
NICO:
Told you she'd be fine.

04:38.181 --> 04:40.143
-[Flores yelps]
-MOLLY: Sorry to worry you guys.

04:41.145 --> 04:42.355
MOLLY:
Who's hungry?

04:42.815 --> 04:45.153
[theme music playing]

05:56.504 --> 05:59.468
You know what? I almost forgot.
That Flores guy, he took my phone.

05:59.552 --> 06:02.432
Then he's tracking us.
That's right out of the Minoru handbook.

06:02.516 --> 06:04.771
ALEX: You know what that means.
Everybody toss your burners.

06:06.106 --> 06:07.777
Problem solved.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.697
-Just one question.
-GERT: You mean,

06:09.781 --> 06:12.285
like, why did we just treat the streets
of our beloved city

06:12.369 --> 06:14.498
like a Taiwanese landfill?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.085
Who's this?

06:16.168 --> 06:18.882
I'm Livvie. Who are you?
Do you have a bionic dinosaur too?

06:18.966 --> 06:21.011
The dinosaur isn't bionic.

06:21.095 --> 06:22.222
I'm Karolina.

06:22.305 --> 06:23.767
That's my friend Livvie.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.021
-She's coming with us tonight.
-I am?

06:26.105 --> 06:28.025
Thanks for making the decision
for all of us.

06:28.109 --> 06:29.486
Including me.

06:29.570 --> 06:31.783
I'm sorry, I just meant that
you should come over tonight,

06:31.866 --> 06:33.662
and then we can decide
what we're gonna do in the morning.

06:33.745 --> 06:36.584
That's...if you wanted to sleep over.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.298
Do you want me to?

06:40.341 --> 06:41.468
If you want to.

06:42.345 --> 06:44.559
That was romcom cute,

06:44.642 --> 06:46.478
but can we figure out
where we're going?

06:46.563 --> 06:48.942
Gert, take her home.
We can't afford any more risks.

06:49.026 --> 06:50.821
No, Gert, we're going to the hostel.
Take a right.

06:50.904 --> 06:52.533
NICO:
Bad idea. It's not safe.

06:52.616 --> 06:54.954
This is stupid. Livvie has
more than proven herself to us.

06:55.038 --> 06:57.000
GERT: I have to pee,
and we're running out of gas.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.503
We're going home.

07:13.658 --> 07:15.537
Welcome, Livvie.
Make yourself at home.

07:15.621 --> 07:18.209
Oh, and if you're hungry,
we're really good at dumpster diving.

07:18.292 --> 07:19.712
LIVVIE:
How did you find this place?

07:20.964 --> 07:23.135
Dumb luck, I guess.

07:23.219 --> 07:26.308
Yeah, we were chasing this guy
who stole Chase's Fistigons--

07:26.391 --> 07:28.563
that's what they're called,
the robot gloves--

07:28.647 --> 07:32.696
and Old Lace, that's the dinosaur,
Gert's a classic movie buff--

07:32.780 --> 07:35.451
anyways, Old Lace tackles this guy,

07:35.536 --> 07:37.748
Karolina falls through that skylight,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.963
and boom! Underground mansion.

07:41.046 --> 07:42.716
Was Karolina OK?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.554
ALEX:
Yeah. No, she was fine.

07:44.637 --> 07:46.975
She was glowing, so, you know,
she hovered.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.312
You know that sounds totally crazy,
right?

07:49.396 --> 07:52.862
Yup. Welcome to the hostel.

07:52.945 --> 07:56.368
This is my spot,
we call it Alexville,

07:56.451 --> 07:58.748
or at least I do, in my head.

07:58.832 --> 08:01.295
This place is freakin' huge,
and you don't get a room?

08:01.378 --> 08:05.386
Well, I've been spending all my time
with this cool girl from Compton.

08:05.469 --> 08:07.098
Who needs a room?

08:08.602 --> 08:11.106
-[phone chimes]
-Was that your phone?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.444
Yeah. Tamar's been
texting me like crazy.

08:13.528 --> 08:15.532
You didn't get rid of it
like the rest of us?

08:15.616 --> 08:17.285
If that AWOL guy knows
that you're with us,

08:17.368 --> 08:18.663
he could be tracking us right now.

08:18.747 --> 08:20.291
I--I'm just supposed to toss my phone

08:20.374 --> 08:22.128
and throw away the little memories
I have with Darius?

08:22.212 --> 08:23.798
-This is evidence.
-Evidence?

08:23.882 --> 08:26.888
When he allegedly killed Destiny,
he was at my birthday party.

08:26.971 --> 08:29.810
And I'll lose the footage
of us leaving the hospital.

08:29.894 --> 08:31.940
-I know it went wrong--
-Wait, you have footage from the hospital?

08:33.359 --> 08:34.986
Can I see that?

08:35.989 --> 08:37.325
Livvie, please.

08:50.017 --> 08:51.646
[typing]

08:52.565 --> 08:54.819
TAMAR: Say bye!

08:54.902 --> 08:57.783
[gunfire]

08:57.866 --> 08:59.579
There's the car.

08:59.662 --> 09:02.668
[gunfire continues on video]

09:03.503 --> 09:05.464
-ALEX: It's him.
-LIVVIE: AWOL.

09:06.425 --> 09:09.055
Look, we got it, OK?

09:09.139 --> 09:11.101
But I have to destroy your phone.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.938
I can save everything. OK?

09:13.022 --> 09:14.775
Anything you want, it's yours.

09:14.859 --> 09:18.533
Then I'm gonna make it look like
your phone's in the mountains of Wakanda.

09:18.617 --> 09:20.244
-You can do that?
-ALEX: What?

09:20.328 --> 09:22.708
Did you really think
I didn't have a superpower?

09:22.791 --> 09:24.837
So then what,
what do we do with it?

09:24.920 --> 09:27.843
ALEX: Well, we know that
we can't trust the police--

09:27.926 --> 09:29.930
my mom owns them, too.

09:30.014 --> 09:31.517
Aside from being an assassin,

09:31.601 --> 09:33.437
she's also one of the city's
top defense attorneys.

09:33.521 --> 09:36.653
So what's the plan?
You always have one.

09:36.736 --> 09:39.825
ALEX: We're gonna use
the little fish, a. k. a. AWOL,

09:39.909 --> 09:42.748
to get to the big fish, better known
as our awful parents.

09:42.831 --> 09:46.004
Technically, aren't piranhas little fish?
Moray eels? They're both deadly.

09:46.088 --> 09:48.843
OK, great, so you're a cosmetologist
and an oceanologist.

09:48.927 --> 09:52.308
Look, I understand that you're scared.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.481
OK, but you have no idea
what our parents are capable of.

09:55.565 --> 09:58.237
-We have to take them down.
-LIVVIE: I don't know, Alex.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.074
I don't know what to say,
who to trust--

10:00.157 --> 10:01.410
Trust me.

10:02.078 --> 10:05.334
OK, but no more secrets--
not between us.

10:05.418 --> 10:07.088
No more secrets.

10:11.388 --> 10:13.308
I have one more request.

10:14.269 --> 10:15.939
Request away.

10:16.691 --> 10:18.528
Can I meet the dinosaur?

10:33.265 --> 10:34.392
[chitters]

10:39.612 --> 10:41.991
FLORES: You've been keeping secrets
from the beginning.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.789
LESLIE: We figured it was
a need-to-know basis kind of a thing.

10:44.872 --> 10:46.500
FLORES:
I should have known you psychos

10:46.584 --> 10:49.757
would Frankenstein your own kids
into super-powered assholes.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.596
Hey, slight clarification.
Our kids are not assholes.

10:52.679 --> 10:53.932
And they don't all have powers.

10:54.015 --> 10:57.271
FLORES: Right. Some of them
only have military-grade weapons

10:57.355 --> 10:58.608
and hacking computers.

10:58.691 --> 11:01.363
You sent me in unprepared!

11:02.198 --> 11:04.077
But I won't do the same.

11:05.496 --> 11:07.876
Heads up. They're comin' for you.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.799
GEOFFREY:
Comin' for us how?

11:12.636 --> 11:14.515
They're onto Darius's murder.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.565
If they dig any deeper,
it leads right back to this room.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.192
To all of us!

11:22.405 --> 11:24.325
Look, you don't need
to square off with our kids.

11:24.409 --> 11:26.831
You just find 'em.
We'll take care of the rest.

11:43.573 --> 11:45.619
PRIDE was supposed to be over.

11:45.702 --> 11:48.791
Only you two have dragged us all back in
with this Darius crap.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.756
You weren't singing that tune when
it got your daughter off murder charges.

11:51.839 --> 11:53.342
We saved all our kids.

11:53.425 --> 11:55.639
We've been tied to each other
for too long.

11:55.722 --> 11:59.103
We were fools to think ending PRIDE
would absolve us of our misdeeds.

11:59.187 --> 12:00.815
ROBERT:
Or end our association.

12:00.899 --> 12:03.403
And now we could all to go prison.

12:03.487 --> 12:05.115
STACEY: Come on, guys,
don't be so pessimistic.

12:05.199 --> 12:07.663
-We can fix this.
-DALE: Stacy's right.

12:07.746 --> 12:10.919
I believe it was The Tramp himself,
the great Charlie Chaplin,

12:11.002 --> 12:14.593
who once said, "You're never gonna
find a rainbow if you're looking down."

12:14.677 --> 12:16.429
Oh, hon! I like that.

12:16.514 --> 12:19.853
What happens if Flores
does find the kids?

12:19.937 --> 12:21.565
They want nothing to do with us.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.360
They're armed, not afraid,
and coming for us.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.532
Let's not forget, we're still PRIDE.

12:26.199 --> 12:29.163
The most brilliant minds in biotech,
computers, and engineering

12:29.247 --> 12:30.374

12:31.167 --> 12:32.420
Thanks for including us, Vic.

12:32.504 --> 12:33.923
LESLIE:
What are you suggesting?

12:35.300 --> 12:37.639
We build our own weapons.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.518
To turn on our kids?

12:39.601 --> 12:41.396
ROBERT:
Of course this is your idea.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.651
You're the same man
who blasted his son

12:43.735 --> 12:45.613
through a plate glass window.
-VICTOR: Yes.

12:45.697 --> 12:49.580
Unfortunately, I hurt my son.
But that's not what I'm doing here.

12:49.663 --> 12:52.460
They'd just simply be tools
to ensure our safety

12:52.544 --> 12:54.130
and, ultimately, theirs.

12:54.213 --> 12:57.428
You really think this is the best way
to bring them home?

12:57.512 --> 12:59.390
It is, if it's the only way.

13:04.442 --> 13:06.112
I'll help you.

13:06.196 --> 13:07.406
Thank you.

13:07.490 --> 13:09.536
We'll start today.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.093
GERT:
I don't understand.

13:17.176 --> 13:19.973
She's never been like this before.

13:20.057 --> 13:22.729
-[Old Lace growling]
-Old Lace, you have to eat something.

13:22.813 --> 13:24.775
OK, watch me.

13:24.858 --> 13:26.486
I'll eat it first.

13:26.570 --> 13:29.492
Whoa! Wait!
You're gonna eat a palm tree?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.831
Maybe if she sees me do it,
then she'll eat.

13:31.914 --> 13:34.252
It's the sacrifice we have to make
as parents, Molly.

13:35.129 --> 13:36.256
We have crackers.

13:36.339 --> 13:38.553
They're cardboard bland
and they're easy to digest.

13:38.636 --> 13:40.849
-I'll be right back.
-[softly growling]

13:43.688 --> 13:45.023
Chase.

13:45.107 --> 13:48.823
-Molly.
-MOLLY: Cool. We're no longer strangers.

13:48.906 --> 13:51.579
Gert needs your help.
It's Old Lace. She won't eat.

13:51.662 --> 13:54.333
CHASE: And Gert wants
to use me as bait?

13:54.417 --> 13:55.962
MOLLY:
Don't be a jerk.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.298
Gert hates me.

13:57.381 --> 13:59.595
I drowned her dreams
in a chocolate waterfall.

13:59.678 --> 14:01.347
MOLLY:
You didn't drown her dreams.

14:01.431 --> 14:04.103
It's an application.
She can get another one online.

14:04.186 --> 14:06.609
Gert was just...afraid

14:06.692 --> 14:08.571
that you wouldn't support her decision.

14:08.654 --> 14:10.198
Wait. She said that?

14:11.242 --> 14:12.453
Not really.

14:12.537 --> 14:16.044
Um, I'm just kinda getting really good
at this whole advice thing.

14:16.127 --> 14:17.631
CHASE:
I know. But after

14:17.714 --> 14:20.762
everything that went down
in the hotel...

14:20.845 --> 14:22.933
I think we're over-over.

14:24.937 --> 14:27.943
Is it that unfair for Gert
to consider a future without you?

14:29.571 --> 14:32.326
No. No, not at all.

14:32.409 --> 14:34.915
It just...

14:34.998 --> 14:37.252
it hurt my feelings.

14:37.336 --> 14:41.637
I thought, "We're a couple and we're
gonna figure things out together." But...

14:41.720 --> 14:44.183
God, if my teammates heard me
talking this way right now--

14:44.266 --> 14:46.772
MOLLY:
Who cares what those idiots think?

14:46.855 --> 14:49.068
I'm sorry.

14:49.151 --> 14:52.659
No, I'm not sorry.
You and Gert don't have to be boo'ed up

14:52.742 --> 14:54.871
in order to make sure
Old Lace is safe.

-[Old Lace softly growls]
-Hey.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.420
Is she OK?

[Old Lace gurgles]

15:22.384 --> 15:24.430
GERT:
She's been tossing all night.

15:24.514 --> 15:27.352
Not to mention I woke up
next to Dienonychus vomit,

15:27.436 --> 15:30.192
so I'm doing great, by the way.

15:30.275 --> 15:31.904
CHASE:
Do you want my help or not?

15:31.987 --> 15:33.908
I'm frickin' trying, Gert.

15:36.454 --> 15:37.999
Sorry.

15:38.876 --> 15:40.838
It's that, um...

15:40.922 --> 15:42.592
it's just, this isn't normal.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.807
Maybe...maybe something she ate?

15:45.890 --> 15:47.644
CHASE: I thought you said
she was an omnivore.

15:47.727 --> 15:49.773
GERT: Yeah, but I don't think
they really had Domino's pizza

15:49.856 --> 15:51.693
during the Cretaceous Period.

15:53.488 --> 15:56.995
Well, uh, maybe we change her diet.

15:57.079 --> 15:59.125
I'll get the Fistigons, go hunting?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.670
That's very sweet,

16:00.753 --> 16:04.511
but I was hoping for something
a little less barbaric.

16:04.594 --> 16:07.892
But, speaking of bad ideas...

16:08.686 --> 16:10.648
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Smith.

16:11.608 --> 16:14.906
I was operating from a place of fear.

16:15.992 --> 16:17.369
CHASE:
I get it.

16:19.331 --> 16:21.920
And you're...super smart.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.427
Scary passionate.

16:26.304 --> 16:28.057
And you want more out of life.

16:29.351 --> 16:31.815
But I want you to feel comfortable
telling me things.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.282
Especially if...
we're a couple.

16:43.672 --> 16:46.678
Can we, um...
can we just start over?

16:48.264 --> 16:52.356
Maybe figuring out what's wrong
with Old Lace together?

16:53.233 --> 16:56.113
Yeah. I'd like that a lot.

16:56.197 --> 16:58.201
We have kinda been wingin' it.

17:04.255 --> 17:07.845
-[sharp rapping]
ALEX: Um. OK, yeah.

17:07.929 --> 17:10.935
I know what you're thinking,
and it's definitely a legitimate question.

17:11.018 --> 17:14.316
Can it still be called a muffin
if it also functions

17:14.400 --> 17:17.699
as a blunt object capable
of rendering a man unconscious?

17:17.781 --> 17:21.414
[laughs] It's fine.
I like peanut butter and crackers.

17:21.497 --> 17:23.711
Sorry, I need these. Thanks!

17:26.339 --> 17:29.681
You know, I should just get home.
Tamar, she'll be worried about me.

17:29.764 --> 17:32.645
OK. I'll take you. Maybe we can
get some food on the way?

17:32.729 --> 17:35.860
You mentioned some place
with amazing plantains?

17:35.943 --> 17:39.283
I did, but one problem.
I've seen AWOL there.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.713
Well, maybe it's not a problem.

17:45.796 --> 17:47.717
Could be the perfect way
to get to him.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.598
-Alex, it's too dangerous.
-ALEX: I'll bring my friends.

17:50.681 --> 17:52.769
And you think
they'll be down for that?

17:54.146 --> 17:56.777
Well, maybe we don't
have to tell them.

17:56.860 --> 17:59.616
But you said it was an amazing place,
and they love Caribbean food.

17:59.699 --> 18:02.079
-What about no more secrets?
-I meant between us.

18:03.498 --> 18:05.961
I just met them, Alex.
I'm not cool with lying to them.

18:07.757 --> 18:09.468
Look, it's fine.

18:09.552 --> 18:11.055
OK? Trust me.

18:12.015 --> 18:14.311
Plus, I'll handle all the lying.

Great place, Livvie.

18:43.996 --> 18:46.208
Oh, it was Alex's choice,
but thanks.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.922
Yeah, it's apparently
very popular here, so...

18:49.006 --> 18:51.093
-GERT: Can we sit anywhere?
-LIVVIE: Yeah, just grab a table.

18:51.177 --> 18:52.805

Yo, AWOL, what's up?

18:52.889 --> 18:54.893
Those were the guys who grabbed me.

AWOL:
Come on, man. Yo, Sharon.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.445
What's the deal?
Where's my food at?

19:00.529 --> 19:01.865
It's coming. I'll get it.

19:01.948 --> 19:05.163
Yo, it's always supposed to be here.
I'm tired of coming and waiting.

No, we don't.

19:25.245 --> 19:27.123
AWOL is your idea of a small fish?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.961
GERT:
Small fish can be deadly.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.716
There's the puffer fish, which is small
but very dangerous.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.927

They're vicious.

was such a big deal.

Fine. But we can't trust Tamar.

37:04.152 --> 37:06.031
all because you hate your parents.

37:06.114 --> 37:07.534
You ratted me out?

37:07.618 --> 37:09.789
-You're putting all of us in danger.
-KAROLINA: How could you, Alex?

37:09.872 --> 37:11.542
-NICO: Yeah, what were you thinking?
-CHASE? He wasn't.

37:11.626 --> 37:13.170
ALEX: Or I'm thinking
so many moves ahead

37:13.253 --> 37:15.091
that you can't even keep up.

37:15.174 --> 37:16.844
I'm meeting with AWOL today,

37:16.928 --> 37:19.307
and he's giving me
everything we need to ruin PRIDE.

37:19.391 --> 37:21.521
Then we take it to a guy he knows
at City Hall,

37:21.604 --> 37:23.107
someone that Flores can't get to.

37:23.190 --> 37:26.446
"A guy he knows"? Do you know
how IDTV that sounds?

37:26.531 --> 37:29.160
-How could you be this gullible?
-What other choice do we have?!

37:29.244 --> 37:30.789
We have to find a way
to get over PRIDE's head!

37:30.872 --> 37:35.214
So you're gonna let that asshole AWOL
and his entire squad of assholes go free?

37:35.297 --> 37:36.759
Look...

37:36.843 --> 37:39.097
my strategy has never changed.

37:39.180 --> 37:42.478
OK? I said I'm taking down PRIDE,
so I'm taking down PRIDE.

37:42.563 --> 37:44.817
-You're taking down PRIDE?
-Who are you right now?

37:44.900 --> 37:46.445
There's no "I" in team, Alex.

37:48.323 --> 37:50.369
Coach Alphona told me that one.

37:51.288 --> 37:54.294
You made a deal with a criminal, Alex.

37:54.377 --> 37:58.302
Which is exactly what--
what happened to--

37:58.385 --> 38:00.891
what happened to our parents,
which is--which is--

38:00.974 --> 38:03.479
which is bad, is the point
that I'm trying to make.

38:03.563 --> 38:05.817
-My tongue feels weird.
-Great job, Wilder.

38:05.901 --> 38:08.238
She's already under enough stress
with what's going on with Old Lace.

38:08.322 --> 38:10.159
What's going on with Old Lace?

38:10.242 --> 38:12.998
NICO: She's sleeping finally,
but she's been freaking out.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.670
And you'd know if you were thinking
of anyone else other than yourself.

38:15.754 --> 38:18.050
I never thought I'd say this
to you of all people,

38:18.133 --> 38:20.054
but be smart.

38:20.137 --> 38:23.728
You're still a TARDIS-loving dork
who can't see without his glasses.

38:23.812 --> 38:26.316
-You're not some gangsta.
-ALEX: What about what you've done?!

38:27.110 --> 38:29.239
Stole a car. We robbed our school.

38:31.284 --> 38:33.038
Some of you have done
a lot worse than that.

38:36.002 --> 38:38.550
You know what?
You're all a bunch of hypocrites.

38:42.891 --> 38:45.229
AWOL:
Flores had a file on PRIDE.

38:45.312 --> 38:47.609
He kept everything.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.362
Crime scene photos,

38:49.445 --> 38:51.659
all the information on Darius,

38:51.742 --> 38:55.584
Destiny Gonzalez,
and Graciela Aguirre.

38:55.667 --> 38:59.174
-Son of a bitch.
-AWOL: He's got it all there, and more,

38:59.257 --> 39:01.303
all of PRIDE's sins and misdeeds,

39:01.386 --> 39:03.056
and he's gonna use it against you.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.645
But I'll take care of him,
and the evidence.

39:05.729 --> 39:07.064
Just put me on the payroll.

39:07.148 --> 39:08.651
Where's AWOL?

39:08.735 --> 39:10.362
CASHIER:
He's in the back.

39:10.446 --> 39:12.408
AWOL:
Then I'll bring your kids home.

39:12.491 --> 39:15.707
GEOFFREY: Fine. Flores is out.
We'll get rid of him.

39:15.790 --> 39:18.003
But the Strike Team remains intact--

39:18.086 --> 39:19.506
under a new leader.

39:21.051 --> 39:22.679
TINA:
Are we really doing this again?

39:22.763 --> 39:23.848
Doing what, exactly?

39:23.932 --> 39:25.852
GEOFFREY:
We're an organization of criminals.

39:25.936 --> 39:28.357
We always need someone
on the inside.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.987
-And clearly, AWOL wants the job.
-FLORES: You said...

39:31.071 --> 39:32.658
you got the kids.
Where the hell are you?

39:32.741 --> 39:33.826
AWOL:
I'm right here.

39:34.578 --> 39:36.540
I'll take care of the kids later.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.586
TINA:
We can trust you to handle this?

39:38.670 --> 39:40.507
AWOL:
Trust is such a valuable thing.

39:42.009 --> 39:43.554
And you have mine.

39:45.767 --> 39:47.270
FLORES:
You think this is the answer?

39:47.353 --> 39:50.276
I didn't quite like
how you was doin' things.

39:50.902 --> 39:54.702
So I found another thug
to take your place.

39:57.248 --> 39:58.835
AWOL:
I mean, come on, Flores,

39:58.918 --> 40:02.258
we both know I was never good
at taking orders.

40:03.010 --> 40:04.470
[Flores cries out]

40:08.270 --> 40:10.525
[Flores screaming]

40:10.608 --> 40:12.361
[line out ringing]

40:12.445 --> 40:14.407
-AWOL: Hello?
-Hey. Where are you?

40:14.490 --> 40:16.537
-I've been waiting here--
-AWOL: Change of plans, Alex.

40:16.620 --> 40:18.875
But we're gonna talk real soon.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.503
I promise.

40:21.296 --> 40:22.381
[click]

40:36.326 --> 40:38.121
WOMAN:
Karolina.

40:41.002 --> 40:42.254
Hello?

40:45.678 --> 40:49.018
Karolina. I've been
searching for you.

40:51.398 --> 40:54.237
Hello? Who is it?

40:59.790 --> 41:03.004
Hey.
Everything OK?

41:03.965 --> 41:05.969
I thought I heard something.

41:06.052 --> 41:08.014
Were you trying to call for me?

41:08.766 --> 41:12.440
Uh, n-no. I-- I wasn't aware
that we were doing that.

41:14.152 --> 41:15.530
KAROLINA:
Doing what?

41:16.489 --> 41:18.160
Talking.

41:20.122 --> 41:21.917
Seems like we are now.

41:23.128 --> 41:25.382
Yeah, and it--it-it's...it's--

41:25.466 --> 41:27.011
it's going great.
[awkward chuckle]

41:29.683 --> 41:31.896
I don't want to fight anymore, Nico.

41:34.484 --> 41:36.697
Well, fighting requires talking.

41:39.578 --> 41:42.792
Well, I'm sorry to bother you,
I just thought I heard...something.

41:43.544 --> 41:47.259
A voice. But maybe it's just been
a long couple of days.

41:50.265 --> 41:51.936
NICO:
Tell me about it.

41:53.564 --> 41:55.192
I'd like to.

41:56.236 --> 41:58.616
Maybe things will make more sense
after a good night's rest.

42:01.287 --> 42:02.331
All right then.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.091
Well...good night.

42:09.638 --> 42:11.307
And to you.

42:19.992 --> 42:21.452
Ahh!

42:22.914 --> 42:25.545
[gasps]
Ohh, it's way too hot.

42:27.006 --> 42:28.676
And it's so cold.

42:30.012 --> 42:32.141
Ahh! This is not good.

42:32.642 --> 42:34.103
So not good.

42:34.730 --> 42:35.898
Ohh.

42:35.982 --> 42:37.484
[coughs]

42:39.196 --> 42:41.451
CHASE:
Old Lace, calm down.

42:41.535 --> 42:43.038
-Just breathe, just breathe.
-[Old Lace wheezing]

42:43.121 --> 42:45.292
MOLLY:
She still looks terrible. I'm worried.

42:47.922 --> 42:49.008
[wheezing]

42:50.720 --> 42:52.724
It's gonna be OK.

42:52.807 --> 42:54.519
All right? Just sweat it out.

42:55.270 --> 42:57.859
That's right,
it just means you're getting better.
It just means you're getting better.

42:57.942 --> 43:00.364
-[Old Lace gurgling]
-Hey, Gert.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.992
Think she's getting better.

43:02.076 --> 43:04.998
How is she feeling better
when I feel like I'm dying?

43:05.082 --> 43:07.169
Hey, don't say things like that.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.714
Calm down.
Calm down, girl.

43:10.927 --> 43:12.346
Maybe we should go to your room.

43:13.056 --> 43:14.976
If that's what you want.

43:16.187 --> 43:18.901
This is the part where you correct
my patriarchal and archaic way

43:18.984 --> 43:21.239
-of speaking for you.
-GERT: No, uh...

43:22.992 --> 43:24.996
I--I just need to sit.

43:25.497 --> 43:27.418
[Old Lace wheezes]

43:29.422 --> 43:30.508
CHASE: Gert!

43:31.384 --> 43:33.681
NICO: Gert, just breathe, OK?
We need you to breathe.

43:33.764 --> 43:36.060
-I don't get it. It's like
they're both sick, or...

43:36.144 --> 43:38.649
[wheezing]

43:40.485 --> 43:41.864
...dying.

43:43.032 --> 43:44.243
Wake up!

43:46.038 --> 43:47.374
Wake up!

43:49.295 --> 43:50.715
Wake up.

43:54.096 --> 43:56.350
[tires screeching]

44:01.945 --> 44:03.616
Thought we were supposed
to be waiting on Flores.

44:03.699 --> 44:05.953
-I'm in charge now.
-MITCH: Says who?

44:06.037 --> 44:07.414
Says PRIDE.

44:08.500 --> 44:11.339
First order of business,
find those damn kids.

44:11.422 --> 44:13.343
We tried everything.
We have no leads.

44:13.426 --> 44:16.140
Don't trip.
I got a lead right inside.

44:21.442 --> 44:22.654
[Livvie yells]

44:22.737 --> 44:23.989
LIVVIE:
Tamar!

44:24.741 --> 44:27.079
-[banging on door]
-Livvie, what's going on?!

44:27.997 --> 44:29.751
Ain't no point in running!
She comin' with me.

44:29.835 --> 44:33.383
-We're supposed to be on the same side!
-I changed my mind.

44:33.466 --> 44:36.138
-[Livvie yelling]
-We had a deal!

44:36.222 --> 44:37.892
Where are you taking me?!

44:37.976 --> 44:40.105
Livvie! Livvie!!!

45:29.203 --> 45:31.165
[pencil scratching]
