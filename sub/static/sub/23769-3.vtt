WEBVTT

00:09.320 --> 00:10.160
All right, then.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.200
We'll let you know as soon as
the test run is ready to be initiated.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.360
[distorted voice on phone] 3:16.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.440
Excuse me?

00:16.520 --> 00:21.760
The time of your test
is going to be exactly 3:16 p.m.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.560
Got it. 3:16 it is.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.560
I'll be looking for a nice
little earthquake at that time.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.880
If you succeed, your payment will be
wired to your account by 3:17.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.120
-Good luck.
-[line disconnects]

00:35.640 --> 00:37.280
What do you know about this client?

00:37.360 --> 00:39.520
I know that he pays
generously and on time.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.000
Judy, this guy pays us
to have control over earthquakes.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.520
Earthquakes happen all the time, Marcus.
Okay?

00:45.600 --> 00:48.440
This little one today is gonna pay us
five million dollars each.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.720
The next one's gonna
pay us ten times that.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.440
We're doing something terrible, Judy.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.920
All I care about is that
Daniel and his future family

00:56.000 --> 00:58.080
will never have to worry about money.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.720
The same thing with your kids.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.800
What are you doing?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.440
[chuckles] Your locker was open.
This fell out.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.960
Hey, you did read this book.
You even took notes.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.320
It must've slipped my mind.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.200
But how? You have the best memory
of anyone I know.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.000
I already said I was sorry, Daniel.
I'm human. I made a mistake.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.400
It's not that.
I don't care about the stupid quiz.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
Good.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.200
The important thing is
that we're back together.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.520
We were meant to be, you know.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.320
I'll see you at dinner.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.880
[theme music playing]

02:07.760 --> 02:12.120
A whole day at the beach.
I haven't had a day off since I got here.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.680
No! No, you don't.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.200
A day off means a day off.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.160
What's up, Max? Is it Emma?

02:23.240 --> 02:25.480
She barely even talked to me
when I called her.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.280
She sounded like a robot.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.720
It was like she was upset I even called.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.440
Maybe she's got a lot to deal with,
you know?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.440
With her mom being sick and all.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.600
Yeah, but that's the thing.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.160
If her mom was so sick that
Emma had to leave the Greenhouse,

02:39.240 --> 02:41.720
then why was she dancing and having
so much fun at the dance?

02:41.800 --> 02:42.960
It doesn't make any sense.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.360
Maybe she just wanted to have
one good last time before she left.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
Maybe.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.880
[sighs] Max, I know you miss her,
but you are overthinking this.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.160
You have to let it go.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.920
[sighs]

02:58.400 --> 02:59.400
No!

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
No.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.360
All right, ladies,
so we're gonna take this from the top.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.760
-Okay? Let's go.
-[upbeat music playing]

03:11.840 --> 03:17.560
Five, six, seven, eight.
And step, step, pit and pit, up.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.600
-Oh. [chuckles]
-Oh!

03:21.560 --> 03:22.840
-[music stops]
-I'm... I'm sorry.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.800
-Uh, ladies, let's take five, okay?
-[chuckles softly] My bad.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.080
What's up?

03:30.160 --> 03:33.720
-I just, um, wanted to thank you.
-For...

03:33.800 --> 03:36.440
For helping me
with the equation and stuff.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.600
-Oh, yeah. Of course. You're welcome.
-Yeah.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.000
So, um, I was gonna ask you,

03:42.080 --> 03:45.280
if, uh... I understand you're busy,

03:45.360 --> 03:47.880
-but maybe if you get some time--
-Oh, wait. Hang on, Parker.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.920
Hey, Alex. Listen. You okay?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.280
Yeah. I'm fine. [chuckles softly]

03:54.360 --> 03:56.640
Come on. You know you can
tell me anything, right?

03:57.720 --> 03:58.840
Yeah.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.560
[stammers] Oh. Wait.
I know why you're upset.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.080
You're upset
because you didn't make the cut

04:05.160 --> 04:07.040
on our cheerleading team.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.520
Guys, come on.
Let's take this from the top.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.880
[Alex] No! No, Sophie, it's okay.
I just... I just want...

04:10.960 --> 04:13.880
[sighs] Uh-uh. Trust me on this, okay?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.079
All right. Hey, drop the basketball.

04:18.399 --> 04:22.680
As captain of the Eagles, I command you
to dance and that is a direct order.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.320
[both chuckle]

04:24.400 --> 04:27.200
And let's go. Five, six, seven, eight.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.640
-[upbeat music playing]
-And step, turn, pit, up.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.160
-There we go.
-[chuckles]

04:32.240 --> 04:35.680
[laughs] That's better.
Good, yeah. More on the arms.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.960
[girl] There you go.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.920
Oh, thank you. [chuckles]

04:48.000 --> 04:49.880
I'm so glad I volunteered to supervise.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.360
[chuckles]

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
You want some?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.040
I already put some on.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.000
Could you put some on my back?

05:09.720 --> 05:11.760
Lee. Sunscreen?

05:12.200 --> 05:13.720
Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.240
[exclaims and chuckles]

05:19.320 --> 05:22.040
-Stop moving, Aspen!
-That tickles!

05:25.400 --> 05:27.080
[basketball bouncing]

05:29.800 --> 05:30.920
[exhales]

05:33.960 --> 05:34.960
Hey.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.120
How's the leg?

05:40.280 --> 05:43.120
Better, thanks.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.960
-Mind if I join?
-Sure, why not?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.920
It's not like I own the place.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.400
You're right. My mom does.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.840
She, uh, paid for all this.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.000
Wanna play some Horse?

06:01.240 --> 06:02.080
Why not?

06:02.880 --> 06:07.080
Okay. Hey, but keep in mind,
I'm a little rusty.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.600
Whoo! Guess I'm not that rusty.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.240
Let's see what you got, Woods.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
Nice shot, kid.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.040
You know you'd make
a great cheerleader, right?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.160
I mean, you're tall enough
to be in this formation.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.360
No, no, no, no, no.
You do not want me on your team.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.920
-Oh, no?
-No. I mean, I'm clumsier than Alex was.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.360
-Oh, that's bad. [laughs]
-[chuckles]

06:36.440 --> 06:39.360
[sighs] So, you two are,
like, dating, right?

06:39.440 --> 06:43.480
Uh, Susie, you missed a step.
Remember, it's one, two, three, okay?

06:43.560 --> 06:46.640
So try it again from the top, go.
I'm sorry, you were saying?

06:46.720 --> 06:50.240
Nothing. Just talking about
you and your boyfriend.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.280
Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.160
Oh. You mean Alex?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.960
-Yeah.
-No, silly. No, we're just friends!

06:59.840 --> 07:03.000
But I... I mean, I saw you two
at the dance. It kinda seemed...

07:03.080 --> 07:04.080
No. Mmm-mmm. No, no.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.720
That was strictly a captains-try-to-keep-
the-peace between Brooke and Daniel.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.440
I mean, not like it helped, right?

07:09.520 --> 07:10.960
Right. [chuckles softly]

07:11.920 --> 07:13.800
I see. So that means, you're still...

07:13.880 --> 07:16.480
-Good. That was perfect.
-I see.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.160
Cool.

07:29.760 --> 07:34.560
So much fun! It is much better
than the dreary Atlantic.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
Yeah.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.960
Hayley, so, um... about yesterday,

07:41.040 --> 07:43.880
I wanted to thank you
for setting my head on straight.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.000
Everything's cool, Aspen.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.080
I just lose it sometimes,
when I get competitive.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.320
My mother says it's because
I'm a natural born winner,

07:49.400 --> 07:51.200
and I have trouble accepting
that others are not like me.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
Whatever.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.080
I mean, if I were you,
I'd be upset, as well.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.320
All of sudden, out of nowhere,

07:56.400 --> 07:59.760
someone like me shows up
at the Greenhouse, all confident and...

08:02.600 --> 08:05.360
Look! There's Leo. Lee-Lee, I'm coming!

08:14.120 --> 08:16.760
Just like that. Mmm-hmm.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.760
-[Alex] Watch this.
-[scoffs] Yeah, right.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
[grunts]

08:25.040 --> 08:26.120
[exclaims]

08:26.960 --> 08:29.120
-Okay.
-Hmm.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.920
All right. Here we go, Woods. You ready?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.720
-No way. [chuckles]
-Yeah way.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.280
Just like that. I told you I'm the man.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.720
-[sighs]
-And now, to break the tie.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.640
-[chuckles softly]
-And that's an "E" for HORSE!

08:51.720 --> 08:53.000
Lucky shot.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.440
[Daniel] All right.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.640
Oof. Nice try, kid.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
[sighs]

09:14.800 --> 09:18.360
-Get up, Max. We're one person short.
-But I'm ahead.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.000
Of yourself?

09:21.120 --> 09:25.440
This is our chance to kick Aspen's butt.
We can't miss this opportunity.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.160
Be a sport, Max.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.800
-Max is gonna play with us!
-[all cheering]

09:42.200 --> 09:44.960
-[Leo] You guys ready? Let's do this.
-[all cheering]

09:46.960 --> 09:48.000
[indistinct chatter]

09:53.000 --> 09:56.080
-Max!
-Max, come on! Throw it to me!

09:58.600 --> 10:00.680
-Whoo!
-[squeals]

10:11.880 --> 10:15.040
-You know you look ridiculous, right?
-You gonna talk or you gonna throw?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.200
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
Not bad, Woods.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.320
[sighs] Thanks.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.840
[Daniel sighs]

10:41.040 --> 10:42.080
You know...

10:43.480 --> 10:45.280
I'm glad you joined the Eagles.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.360
-Really?
-It makes me work harder.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.360
Work harder to find ways
to make me miserable?

10:53.440 --> 10:55.600
That, too. [chuckles]

10:55.680 --> 10:57.960
[laughs]

10:59.400 --> 11:02.200
Hey, uh, I wanna ask you something.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.880
But just between you and me.

11:05.880 --> 11:06.880
Okay.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.960
So when Brooke was gone all day,
where was she?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.040
Why didn't you ask her?

11:15.960 --> 11:17.400
I tried, but...

11:20.200 --> 11:24.080
we've been having some, um... issues.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.520
She went back to Eric's office
to investigate your mom.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.920
But she found nothing on her.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.760
I see...

11:33.920 --> 11:35.160
You know, uh...

11:37.880 --> 11:41.640
-Never mind. It's... it's stupid.
-What?

11:43.480 --> 11:48.520
At first, I thought someone
messed with her brain or something.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.680
You gotta admit, she did a total 180
going back to you like that.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.440
But I guess I was just upset...

11:59.520 --> 12:02.320
realizing I was nothing more
than a rebound guy.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.360
Hey, kid...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.880
you have to stop
putting yourself down like that.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.840
Good game, buddy.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.040
[Alex] Good game.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.440
[sighing]

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
[indistinct chatter]

12:38.440 --> 12:41.480
Max. That's it, okay? You need to focus.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.720
Okay. Think of Emma. Make her proud.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.760
-She didn't even care for sports.
-That's not the point!

12:49.600 --> 12:51.000
Improvise. Your mom didn't pay

12:51.120 --> 12:53.600
for all those expensive
ballroom dancing classes for nothing.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.880
[whispering]

13:03.440 --> 13:04.440
[Max] Okay.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.640
Jackie!

13:16.480 --> 13:17.480
[grunting]

13:18.120 --> 13:19.880
Yeah!

13:19.960 --> 13:22.400
[all cheering]

13:22.480 --> 13:24.000
[laughing]

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
[Hayley] Good job.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.280
Nice touchdown, Miller.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.120
That's a line I never thought
I would ever hear. [chuckles]

13:33.880 --> 13:34.960
Come on!

13:38.920 --> 13:40.840
-[yelps]
-[all exclaim]

13:40.920 --> 13:43.520
-Yes!
-[all muttering]

13:43.600 --> 13:45.640
[man] You okay?

13:45.720 --> 13:48.360
Hayley, are you all right?

13:48.440 --> 13:50.440
Sorry, didn't even know my own strength.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.960
What? It's not like I did it on purpose!

13:55.040 --> 13:58.080
Okay, guys. Game's over. You won.
We need to talk.

14:19.040 --> 14:23.200
She is deceivingly fast. I miscalculated.
I didn't mean to knock her down.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.600
That is not the point.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.680
[stammering] What? What's the point, then?

14:27.760 --> 14:32.240
I just... wish you had talked to me
before getting on that plane.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.680
Why?

14:36.160 --> 14:38.400
Okay. I admit it.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.760
I didn't want to talk to you because
I was afraid you'd tell me not to come.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.600
I was afraid I'd lose you.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.120
There's something I have to tell you,
Aspen.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.720
I know what you're going to say

14:48.800 --> 14:52.120
and I know what happened between
you and Hayley before the dance.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.920
But it's perfectly okay.
We were in an LDR.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.240
-I was far away. But I'm here now--
-I'm in love with her.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.520
And that's fine, too! People fall in love.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.360
But here's the thing.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.400
What you and I have is special.
It's for life.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.760
You had a crush because
you were lonely and you missed us.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.200
I understand it completely.

15:16.280 --> 15:20.200
But... you and I both know

15:20.280 --> 15:24.160
what we have here is much stronger
than any affair

15:24.240 --> 15:26.560
that you may or may not
have had with Hayley.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.520
I know deep down you know I'm right.

15:33.960 --> 15:38.960
Oh, gosh. It is hot.
I'm going to go for a swim, all right?

15:43.080 --> 15:44.760
[doorknob rattling]

16:01.600 --> 16:02.640
[exhales]

16:12.040 --> 16:14.720
[Marcus] These mark the trigger points,
which we know

16:14.800 --> 16:17.720
are susceptible to seismic stimulus, okay?

16:17.800 --> 16:20.080
I thought this one would be
perfect for our trial run.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.920
That seems really close to where we are.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.040
It's four miles in the ocean.

16:26.120 --> 16:30.120
All we need today is an extremely
localized and measured tremor

16:30.200 --> 16:34.280
which will be detected by
the US Geological Survey monitors,

16:34.360 --> 16:35.880
but we down here won't even feel it.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.880
Well, what about the Greenhouse?
Are they gonna feel the earthquake there?

16:38.960 --> 16:42.880
Not unless they all board a yacht
and sail four miles west.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.360
Okay. Let's proceed.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.319
What do you say you teach me
how to play chess?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.160
When? Right now?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.400
-Why not?
-It takes years to master chess.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.680
Well, then we better get started.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.240
-Have you guys seen Hayley?
-No.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.319
Thanks.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.040
Chess is all about strategy and patience.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.839
It's about planning
your moves ahead of time

17:24.920 --> 17:26.480
and always thinking
about the bigger picture.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.040
What's so funny?
I knew you were gonna find this boring.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.600
Now I know why Emma called you
her "white knight."

17:35.960 --> 17:38.040
-How did I miss it?
-Miss what?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.960
Do you know what this is?

17:40.040 --> 17:42.360
-A horse.
-No! It's a white knight!

17:42.440 --> 17:44.240
Emma was trying to tell me
something in her letter.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.000
She... she must have wanted to leave me
a message or something.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.760
A message? What are you talking about?

17:49.840 --> 17:50.920
I told you she was acting weird.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.400
She must have wanted
to tell me something, but she couldn't.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.840
Come on. We gotta go.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.400
-Go where?
-Back to the clubhouse.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.440
No way. I'm not going to school.
It's our day off!

18:01.520 --> 18:02.560
Be a sport, Jackie.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.920
-[groans]
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.560
It's time. Marcus?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.080
Initiate the program.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.400
[typing]

18:22.760 --> 18:24.480
Initiated.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.960
[electricity crackling]

18:44.560 --> 18:46.600
[beeping]

18:46.680 --> 18:48.080
What's that beep? What's going on?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.880
Seismic activity has increased.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.720
-That's not the ocean.
-[beeping continues]

18:59.160 --> 19:03.000
-The radius seems to have expanded.
-Is that the Greenhouse?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.160
-Come on!
-[Jackie groans]

19:09.080 --> 19:13.040
You do realize all the food's
gonna be gone by the time we get back.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.680
Hurry up!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.480
-[electricity crackling]
-[beeping]

19:50.320 --> 19:52.760
-Stop it now, Marcus.
-Nothing's happening.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.320
Stop it now, Marcus!

19:54.400 --> 19:55.760
You don't understand.
There's nothing I can do.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.360
-I don't care.
-We have to wait

19:57.440 --> 19:59.280
-for the program to complete its cycle.
-Do something.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
[rumbling]

20:00.440 --> 20:03.680
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Oh, God. Oh, God.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.440
[all screaming]

20:05.520 --> 20:07.520
[woman] Everyone, let's get out of here!

20:09.520 --> 20:11.920
[all screaming]

20:12.000 --> 20:13.240
The whole network must be down!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.480
Help!

20:30.280 --> 20:32.280
Help!
