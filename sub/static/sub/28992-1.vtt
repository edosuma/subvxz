[Ivan] <i>An accomplished
bank robber and escape artist,</i>

01:28.853 --> 01:30.119
<i>Willie Sutton,</i>

01:30.121 --> 01:33.689

why he robbed banks.</i>

01:33.691 --> 01:35.192
<i>Sutton remarked,</i>

01:35.194 --> 01:36.463

where the money is."</i>

01:43.234 --> 01:45.401
Hey, asshole!

01:45.403 --> 01:47.303
[Ivan] <i>And Sutton was right.</i>

01:47.305 --> 01:48.871
<i>Money is in the bank.</i>

01:48.873 --> 01:50.773
<i>But it's also in the wallets,</i>

01:50.775 --> 01:53.544
<i>the shoeboxes, cookie jars,</i>

01:53.546 --> 01:55.648

02:02.587 --> 02:04.555
[Ivan]
<i>If Sutton were alive today,</i>

02:04.557 --> 02:06.356
<i>he wouldn't be robbing banks.</i>

02:06.358 --> 02:08.324
<i>He'd be robbing the wealthy.</i>

02:08.326 --> 02:11.563
<i>They're cavalier, entitled,
and unsuspecting.</i>

02:13.365 --> 02:15.899

Hello.

03:21.432 --> 03:23.767
Can I, uh, put this somewhere?

03:23.769 --> 03:25.471
- Thrown it on the pile.
- Thanks.

03:27.573 --> 03:31.308
Hey, uh, do you know
where the fellas are?

03:31.310 --> 03:33.876
- By the piano.
- Oh. There they are.

03:33.878 --> 03:35.445
Hey, man.
Can I, uh, get one of those?

03:35.447 --> 03:36.649
Take this one.

03:37.415 --> 03:38.281
[Ivan] Cheers.

03:38.283 --> 03:40.816

I'm teaching my grandson
magic now.

03:48.326 --> 03:50.994
- My wife calls it child abuse.
- [guests chattering]

03:50.996 --> 03:52.328
Take two fingers.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.930
Like that. Give it a little tug.

03:54.932 --> 03:57.500
Good job.
You loosened it up for me.

03:57.502 --> 03:58.734
[smacks lips]

03:58.736 --> 04:00.703
Now, I'll take this knot.

04:00.705 --> 04:03.639
I want you to place it
in that young gentleman's hand,

04:03.641 --> 04:05.811
and introduce yourselves.
That's you, son.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.778
Uh...

04:07.780 --> 04:10.383
- Hi. I'm Marguerite.
- I'm Russell.

04:11.349 --> 04:13.019
Do that here. Take that.

04:14.353 --> 04:15.786
Next, uh, left hand up, okay?

04:15.788 --> 04:18.387
And then the knot goes
in that hand, right there.

04:18.389 --> 04:19.755
- [Ivan] Over the top, right?
- [man 1] Oh, look at you.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.925
You're perfect. Watch this.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.327
[snaps]
[man 1] Open your hand.

04:24.329 --> 04:25.529
[man 1 laughs]
I love this part.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.997
I'll take those.
[chuckles]

04:26.999 --> 04:28.699
You're killing me.
Here, you take those.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.765
[whispers]
Thank you.

04:29.767 --> 04:30.901
Is that your real name?

04:30.903 --> 04:32.069
Yeah, of course.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.637
- Really?
- No.

04:33.639 --> 04:34.641
[Marguerite chuckles]

04:35.607 --> 04:37.841
So, what brings you here
tonight?

04:37.843 --> 04:40.043
Uh, you know,
I just love poetry.

04:40.045 --> 04:42.478
- What about you?
- Oh.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.413
Yeah. It's my absolute
favorite thing ever.

04:44.415 --> 04:45.981
Oh, yeah? What kinds?

04:45.983 --> 04:48.485
I mean, epic, self-conscious,

04:48.487 --> 04:49.853
limerick, haiku, free verse.

04:49.855 --> 04:50.921
Slam?

04:50.923 --> 04:53.423
That is the form at its finest.

04:53.425 --> 04:54.824
Sure.

04:54.826 --> 04:57.560
No, seriously, what are you...
What are you doing here?

04:57.562 --> 05:00.430
I'm, uh...
I'm an art consultant.

05:00.432 --> 05:01.964
What the fuck does that mean?

[glass clinks]

05:04.069 --> 05:05.969
Holy shit.
I can't believe that works.

05:05.971 --> 05:07.671
- [all laugh]
- Ahh...

05:07.673 --> 05:09.772
I'm a bit more shit-faced
than planned.

05:09.774 --> 05:11.041
[Michael] Surprise, surprise!

05:11.043 --> 05:13.409
All right.
Fuck you very much, Michael.

05:13.411 --> 05:14.478
Uh, as we all know,

05:14.480 --> 05:17.514
Michael here has
a new book of poems.

05:17.516 --> 05:19.382
- [man 2] Yes.
- [crowd cheers]

05:19.384 --> 05:22.618
[Ian] A light smattering
of applause for poetry.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.586
Wonderful.

05:23.588 --> 05:26.723
Everybody, if you wanna grab
your beverages,

05:26.725 --> 05:28.024
and follow me out
to the pool house

05:28.026 --> 05:31.161
where we can entice Michael
to read some poems.

05:31.163 --> 05:32.928
- [Michael muttering]
- [man 2] Please.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.430
Hold it. Hold it a minute.

05:34.432 --> 05:35.832
- [applause]
- One. One poem.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.099
[Ian] Two poems from Michael.

05:37.101 --> 05:40.670
[Michael] "One." I said, "One."
You heard me say "one," right?

05:40.672 --> 05:42.505
I'm gonna get another,
uh, glass of red wine.

05:42.507 --> 05:44.440
- Do you want something?
- Sure. What the hell?

05:44.442 --> 05:45.444
I'll be outside.

06:17.742 --> 06:20.043
All right. As negotiated,

06:20.045 --> 06:22.178
I am going to read one poem.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.980
I think he means two.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.514
All right. I'll read two

06:25.516 --> 06:26.916
if someone shuts
this asshole up.

[Ivan] Uh-oh!

07:13.732 --> 07:14.734
You got me.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.767
- Bang.
- Oh!

07:17.769 --> 07:19.702
That was close.

07:19.704 --> 07:20.971
[girl] What are you doing?

07:20.973 --> 07:22.137
Uh... It's a rug.

07:22.139 --> 07:23.507
Someone spilled some wine on it,

07:23.509 --> 07:25.140
so I'm gonna take it
to the cleaners.

07:25.142 --> 07:26.445
Where are my dads?

07:26.978 --> 07:28.611
Your dads are...

07:28.613 --> 07:30.813
Your dads are at the pool house.
Over there.

07:30.815 --> 07:32.214
You wanna go...
You wanna go and see them?

07:32.216 --> 07:33.884
- [girl] Yes.
- Okay.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.985
How old are you?
I bet you're six, right?

07:35.987 --> 07:37.988
- [girl] I'm four.
- You're four?

07:37.990 --> 07:40.789
Wow! Now that is advanced.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.091
Let's go see 'em.

07:42.093 --> 07:43.161
[Ivan] Hey, uh...

07:43.995 --> 07:45.695
Could you do me a favor?

07:45.697 --> 07:47.699
- [girl] Okay.
- Great. Let's go.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.166
[Michael] "What is this labor?"

07:51.168 --> 07:53.637
That guy told me
to bring you this.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.704
[Marguerite] Which guy?

07:54.706 --> 07:55.775
That guy.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.774
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:58.776 --> 08:00.142
[Michael] For the life...

08:00.144 --> 08:01.211
to peel.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.711
- [man 3] What's in the bag?
- Huh.

08:02.713 --> 08:03.947
[Ivan] You mean,
"Who's in the bag?" Right?

08:03.949 --> 08:04.951
[Ivan chuckles]

08:06.218 --> 08:10.122

[man 4] I need the key
for the one on the right.

08:13.858 --> 08:15.724
- [woman 3] I got it!
- [man 4] Thanks.

08:15.726 --> 08:16.825

10:15.346 --> 10:17.147
Thank you for making it
so quickly.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.416
Uh, I'm gonna just
get down to it.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.017
- [Ivan] Sure.
- It's come to a point

10:21.019 --> 10:23.386
where we can't really
keep up with him.

10:23.388 --> 10:25.088
[Ivan] Right. Understood.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.890
Yeah. We have to take
into consideration

10:26.892 --> 10:28.791
the community at large.
We're a small group.

10:28.793 --> 10:30.826
And, frankly, as much as we love

10:30.828 --> 10:33.195
having Raymond around,
he's just...

10:33.197 --> 10:35.464
a lot for us to handle,
as I'm...

10:35.466 --> 10:37.700
- sure you're aware.
- Yeah. No.

10:37.702 --> 10:39.703
No, no, of course. Um...

10:39.705 --> 10:42.305
Can you give me an indication
of, of his behavior,

10:42.307 --> 10:43.239
what he's doing?

10:43.241 --> 10:45.874
Yes, but, uh...
First, here are his papers

10:45.876 --> 10:47.276
and some of his drawings.

10:47.278 --> 10:49.215
I think he has everything else
with him.

10:50.481 --> 10:51.750
Ah...

10:53.719 --> 10:54.787
[Ivan chuckles]

10:56.922 --> 10:57.956
Excellent.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.157
It's the prostitutes.

11:02.159 --> 11:03.059
I'm sorry?

11:03.061 --> 11:05.228
Well, he's bribing
the security guards,

11:05.230 --> 11:07.830
stockpiling lithium,
Adderall, and Xylo-Pfan,

11:07.832 --> 11:11.100
and trading that to prostitutes
who give him barbiturates.

11:11.102 --> 11:13.469
Yeah. They're...
They're prostitutes?

11:13.471 --> 11:16.406
We're a municipal volunteer
halfway house.

11:16.408 --> 11:18.340
We do what we can, but...

11:18.342 --> 11:19.743
we're in the middle of the city.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.210
Yeah, of course.

11:21.212 --> 11:22.845
[Mary] I'm really sorry.

11:22.847 --> 11:24.280
He's a lovely guy
to have around,

11:24.282 --> 11:26.916
but with these fragile people,
it's just...

11:26.918 --> 11:29.084
- It's too dangerous.
- [Ivan] Mm-hm.

11:29.086 --> 11:31.256
[Mary] <i>I have a feeling
your brother will be just fine.</i>

11:32.758 --> 11:33.926
[Ray sighs]

11:35.527 --> 11:37.227
You wanna hear a joke?

11:37.229 --> 11:38.230
Why the fuck not?

11:39.431 --> 11:40.432
Okay.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.269
An Irishman walks out of a bar.

11:49.807 --> 11:51.373
- [both chuckle]
- That's awful.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.312

11:55.980 --> 11:57.379
This is my stop.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.982
[Ray groans]

11:58.984 --> 12:00.116
[Mick] All right, man.
You take care.

12:00.118 --> 12:01.785
[Ray] Yep. You too.

12:01.787 --> 12:02.788
Hey.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.860
[tense music]

12:12.330 --> 12:13.863
[Ivan] Do you wanna
eat something?

12:13.865 --> 12:14.866
[Ray] Yeah.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.533
[Ivan] You heard about Dad?

12:17.535 --> 12:18.737
[Ray] Yeah.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.211
We should probably
have a funeral.

12:27.578 --> 12:28.780
[door chimes]

12:29.413 --> 12:30.448
It sucks.

12:33.184 --> 12:34.883
Well, how about, um...

12:34.885 --> 12:36.886
a moment of silence?

12:36.888 --> 12:38.423
- Sure. Mm-hm.
- Sound nice?

12:40.057 --> 12:41.059
[silverware clinks]

12:55.273 --> 12:57.507
How many more moments
do you wanna do?

12:57.509 --> 12:59.342
[scoffs]
What's the matter with you, man?

12:59.344 --> 13:00.443
Nothing. You just had a moment.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.177
That was a moment
of silence here.

13:02.179 --> 13:03.478
I'm trying to say goodbye
to my father.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.214
Okay.

13:05.216 --> 13:06.449
Is something going on with you?

13:06.451 --> 13:07.983
- No.
- You mad at me?

13:07.985 --> 13:08.884
- No.
- You worried about me?

13:08.886 --> 13:09.920
You don't have to be worried
about me.

13:09.922 --> 13:10.987
- I'm not worried.
- I can take care of myself,

13:10.989 --> 13:13.156
- or we're doomed.
- I... I'm not worried about you.

13:13.158 --> 13:14.390
You know what?
I'm gonna do something for you.

13:14.392 --> 13:16.025
- Yeah. What?
- I want you to listen to me.

13:16.027 --> 13:17.459
- [pills rattling]
- All right?

13:17.461 --> 13:20.032
- Oh, god!
- Just hear me out on this stuff.

13:21.399 --> 13:22.835
Oh. All right.

13:23.368 --> 13:25.368
Diazepam. Right?

13:25.370 --> 13:26.969
Any of the benzos.

13:26.971 --> 13:28.470
[Ivan] Mm-hm.

13:28.472 --> 13:29.372
These are very helpful
if you need

13:29.374 --> 13:31.476
just a little bit of relief.
All right?

13:33.177 --> 13:34.509
So...

13:34.511 --> 13:38.882
All right. Then you got
your dextroamphetamines.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.217
Now, this is the stuff they gave
the super soldiers in Vietnam.

13:41.219 --> 13:44.387
All right? This is a very
practical, 48-hour solution

13:44.389 --> 13:45.921
for the situations that,
you know,

13:45.923 --> 13:47.556
require a little bit
more attention.

13:47.558 --> 13:49.093
- Okay?
- Sounds perfect.

13:51.162 --> 13:52.295
- Think about it.
- Okay.

13:52.297 --> 13:53.296
- I'll think about it.
- That's... You can only, that...

13:53.298 --> 13:55.230
That, you can just get by
with just a half.

13:55.232 --> 13:56.431
I'll think about it.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.837
Did you steal the orphans'
collection can off the counter?

14:00.238 --> 14:01.407
Oh, yeah. Maybe.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.474
- Eagle eyes.
- [Ivan] Mm-hm.

14:05.476 --> 14:06.443
You want me to, uh...

14:06.445 --> 14:08.478
[Ivan] Yeah.
That'd probably be best, right?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.545
[Ray clears throat]

14:09.547 --> 14:11.079
Hi. Uh, sir,

14:11.081 --> 14:12.949
- I just, uh...
- [coins rattling]

14:12.951 --> 14:14.316
managed to, uh,

14:14.318 --> 14:18.220
apprehend the charity tin
from that, uh...

14:18.222 --> 14:22.658
corner. The table there
of the... the punk rockers.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.594
[Ray] You might wanna check
the kitty. That feels...

14:24.596 --> 14:26.228
I don't know.
A little bit light to me.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.232
[manager] Thank you, sir.

14:28.466 --> 14:29.500
Thank you, son.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.507
[sighs]

14:36.041 --> 14:37.042
[thuds]

14:38.442 --> 14:40.343
I mean, well, well, well.

14:40.345 --> 14:42.344
You gotta jiggle the handle.

14:42.346 --> 14:43.979
Excuse me! I mean...

14:43.981 --> 14:45.515
Anyway, this is you.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.950
Well, it's not much,
but it should do for now. Okay?

14:47.952 --> 14:50.386
You got a list
of the local amenities, man?

14:50.388 --> 14:52.254
Maybe a... a map of the area.

14:52.256 --> 14:54.489
My wife and I were just thinking
about taking a quick tour.

14:54.491 --> 14:56.059
[Ivan] It's temporary.
All right?

14:56.061 --> 14:58.393
We're gonna find you something
better, but, you know...

14:58.395 --> 15:00.128
[Ray] Sure.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.196
You can't stay here.

15:01.198 --> 15:02.967
I'm seeing someone, and...

15:03.999 --> 15:04.334
she comes here
from time to time.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.236
Oh, from time to time?
You're not seeing anybody.

15:07.238 --> 15:08.304
[Ivan] What?

15:08.306 --> 15:10.540
[Ray] You're not seeing anybody.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.407
- Uh, yes, I am.
- [fridge door thuds]

15:12.409 --> 15:14.310
- No, you're not.
- [chuckles]

15:14.312 --> 15:16.079
Actually, yes, I am.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.412
Actually,
you just said "actually"

15:17.414 --> 15:19.015
while closing your eyes.
That's a tell.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.717
Also, there's not tampons
or extra toothbrush

15:20.719 --> 15:22.719
in the bathroom.
You know what, I think...

15:22.721 --> 15:23.719
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna get out of here.

15:23.721 --> 15:25.421
[Ivan] No, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.

15:25.423 --> 15:27.323
- Don't do that, Ray.
- Hey, I'm kidding.

15:27.325 --> 15:29.224
Where else am I gonna go?

15:29.226 --> 15:32.130
Look, I'm, I'm grateful
for even one night here.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.065
Thank you.

15:36.634 --> 15:38.070
Put it in the vise.

15:39.269 --> 15:41.403
- Uh...
- Put it in the vise.

15:41.405 --> 15:43.071
[chuckles]
Okay. Good.

15:43.073 --> 15:44.140
Come here.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.144
[Ray groans]

15:46.677 --> 15:48.578
Okay. Okay. We're good, man.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.950
- Yeah.
- [Ivan] Okay. Okeydokey.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.016
Okay. That's enough.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.086
All right. Yeah.

15:57.322 --> 15:58.688
No prostitutes.

15:58.690 --> 15:59.692
I like that.

16:01.426 --> 16:03.429
[slow sensual music]

16:05.230 --> 16:06.628
[Dimitri groans]

16:06.630 --> 16:07.665
[giggles]

16:08.566 --> 16:12.571
[phone ringing, buzzing]

16:17.075 --> 16:19.374
- [moaning]
- All right, that's it.

16:19.376 --> 16:21.012
We gotta wrap it up for today.
That's it.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.519
[creaks]

16:31.755 --> 16:34.357
[clanking]

16:34.359 --> 16:37.096
[wheels rattling]

16:39.163 --> 16:40.765
[engines whirring]

16:43.368 --> 16:44.370
[horse snorts]

16:47.172 --> 16:48.704
[horse whinnies]

16:48.706 --> 16:50.709
[tense music]

17:03.421 --> 17:04.487
[concierge] Can I help you?

17:04.489 --> 17:06.321
Yeah. Uh, I'm meeting someone.

17:06.324 --> 17:07.556
Do you have a reservation?

17:07.558 --> 17:09.459
Hmm... Namath.

17:09.461 --> 17:10.693
[concierge] <i>Oh, it looks like
you're the first to arrive.</i>

17:10.694 --> 17:13.263
<i>You can have a seat at the bar,
and I'll get you set up.</i>

17:15.799 --> 17:17.269
- [Dimitri] <i>Ivan.</i>
- [Ivan] <i>Mm.</i>

17:17.769 --> 17:18.867
[smooches]

17:18.868 --> 17:20.335
Glass of red wine.

17:20.337 --> 17:21.770
[bartender] Any particular type?

17:21.771 --> 17:23.238
Yeah, in a glass.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.806
Red. Down there.

17:24.808 --> 17:26.412
- [bartender] Got it.
- Thanks.

17:26.877 --> 17:28.210
[Dimitri] Come.

17:28.212 --> 17:30.345
So, uh, you got the money, yeah?

17:30.347 --> 17:32.715
Yeah. I gave it
to one of your guys.

17:32.717 --> 17:34.749
Great.

17:34.751 --> 17:37.056
So, what are we, uh...
What are we doing here?

17:38.155 --> 17:39.689
[Ivan] I wanted to talk.

17:39.691 --> 17:40.726
Oh, yeah?

17:41.759 --> 17:43.062
About, uh...

17:44.295 --> 17:46.129
About what exactly?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.499
Well, uh...

17:49.334 --> 17:50.602
by my count, we're close.

17:51.402 --> 17:52.668
Yeah, we're close.

17:52.670 --> 17:55.203
Absolutely. I mean, I have to
check a little more carefully.

17:55.205 --> 17:57.208
Your father was into me
for quite a bit.

17:59.743 --> 18:01.710
He used to sit right up there
at that bar, your old man,

18:01.712 --> 18:03.478
every day with his rice pudding

18:03.480 --> 18:04.782
and the <i>Daily Racing Form.</i>

18:05.849 --> 18:07.251
Never missed a day.

18:08.318 --> 18:09.785
You never got the bug for that?

18:09.787 --> 18:11.254
It's not for me, but look.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.822
Uh, I think I have two more.

18:12.824 --> 18:15.391
Two more, then I'm done.
Then I'm out.

18:15.393 --> 18:17.459
You might take it easy. I'll
take your word for it, okay?

18:17.461 --> 18:18.561
- [Dimitri] Take it easy.
- We talked about this.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.496
No, no. You talked about this.

18:20.498 --> 18:23.231
You talked about it, Ivan.

18:23.233 --> 18:26.401
So, your little shoebox
is full now? That's adorable.

18:26.403 --> 18:27.702
Let me explain something to you

18:27.704 --> 18:29.337
that your father
explained to me.

18:29.339 --> 18:30.573
You have to make hay

18:30.575 --> 18:32.408
while the sun shines.

18:32.410 --> 18:33.875
[Dimitri] You understand
what that means?

18:33.877 --> 18:36.478
Yeah. How'd that work out
for him?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.948
It's a game of discipline.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.950
There are certain forms
that have to be observed.

18:41.952 --> 18:43.321
Of course, you get that.

18:44.721 --> 18:45.723
[Dimitri] Hmm.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.857
One little heart attack
years ago,

18:48.859 --> 18:50.426
I have to take
these fucking horse pills

18:50.428 --> 18:51.760
the whole rest of my life.

18:51.762 --> 18:53.365
- [phone buzzing]
- Excuse me.

18:54.332 --> 18:55.601
[buzzing continues]

18:57.335 --> 18:58.336
[Dimitri] Oh.

18:59.604 --> 19:00.605
[clicks]

19:01.573 --> 19:03.206
You look like shit.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.144
No, I'm okay.
I'm just not sleeping.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.709
[Dimitri] Stop smoking.

19:07.711 --> 19:08.944
Best thing I ever did.

19:08.946 --> 19:11.613
Yeah, I tried that.
I quit two years ago.

19:11.615 --> 19:13.915
So, start smoking.
Fuck do I know?

19:13.917 --> 19:16.686
Look, I got a busy day
ahead of me, okay?

19:16.688 --> 19:17.786
I promise you,

19:17.788 --> 19:20.722
I'm gonna check into
your dad's ticket, all right?

19:20.724 --> 19:23.392
There's something you need
to understand, Ivan.

19:23.394 --> 19:24.492
I trust you.

19:24.494 --> 19:27.263
That's what this is based on.
I love you. I mean,

19:27.265 --> 19:28.631
you're like a son to me.

19:28.633 --> 19:31.467
That's why it's so important
to me that you succeed.

19:31.469 --> 19:32.901
Yeah, and I, and I get that,

19:32.903 --> 19:34.870
and I appreciate everything
you've done for me,

19:34.872 --> 19:37.373
but I'm not gonna do
this forever. I need a number.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.807
You're gonna get
a fucking number, okay.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.508
Keep your pants on, all right?

19:40.510 --> 19:42.277
It's rather complicated.

19:42.279 --> 19:43.645
There's things involved
you don't understand.

19:43.647 --> 19:45.750
I have to work in your
father's vig, all right?

19:47.751 --> 19:49.421
All right? Off you go.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.689
[inhales sharply]

19:52.490 --> 19:53.756
[sighs]

19:53.758 --> 19:55.760
[foreboding music]

19:59.263 --> 20:00.264
[sighs]

20:00.832 --> 20:01.833
What?

20:04.736 --> 20:05.737
Nothing.

20:09.406 --> 20:11.409
[tense music]

20:13.845 --> 20:15.614
[slurping]

20:23.654 --> 20:24.754
[concierge] Hi.

20:24.756 --> 20:25.689
- [man 5] How you doing?
- [concierge] Can I help you?

20:25.691 --> 20:26.590
[man 5] Just meeting
a friend for lunch.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.457
[concierge]
Name for the reservation?

20:28.459 --> 20:29.624
Namath.

20:29.626 --> 20:31.294
[concierge] Okay.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.795
- Can I help you with that?
- No.

20:32.797 --> 20:33.863
Thank you.

20:33.865 --> 20:34.865
[concierge] Follow me.

20:39.336 --> 20:40.568
[water trickling]

20:40.570 --> 20:41.937
[curtain rattles]

20:41.939 --> 20:43.976
[upbeat music]

20:45.509 --> 20:46.778
[machine whirring]

20:55.586 --> 20:56.587
[rattles]

21:14.338 --> 21:16.340
[upbeat music continues]

21:26.550 --> 21:28.017
[engine starts]

21:28.019 --> 21:31.722
[lively music plays via stereo]

21:35.359 --> 21:36.827
- [door opens]
- [lively music stops]

21:39.364 --> 21:40.462
[thuds]

21:40.464 --> 21:42.398
[man 6] Yeah, last week,
it was a little bit nuts...

21:42.400 --> 21:43.498
[valet]
I'll back that up for you.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.600
[overlapping dialogue]

21:44.602 --> 21:45.801
[valet] Last spot on the left.

21:45.803 --> 21:46.901
[Ivan] Hey, man.

21:46.903 --> 21:48.571
I just dropped someone off.
Can I use your bathroom?

21:48.573 --> 21:49.872
The bathroom for the help
is over here.

21:49.874 --> 21:50.909
- Great, thanks.
- [keys jangle]

21:52.943 --> 21:54.945
[tense music]

21:59.450 --> 22:02.117
[breathes deeply]

22:02.119 --> 22:03.321
[clanks]

22:04.588 --> 22:05.656
[doorknob clinks]

22:06.790 --> 22:07.856
Whoa!

22:07.858 --> 22:08.960
Whoa!
[chuckles]

22:09.926 --> 22:11.093
[Ivan exhales]

22:11.095 --> 22:12.428
You're following me.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.328
Yeah, of course.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.430
You've, uh, changed
something though.

22:15.432 --> 22:16.931
Can't figure it out.

22:16.933 --> 22:17.999
What are you doing here?

22:18.001 --> 22:20.536
Uh, it is a big,
big charity event.

22:20.538 --> 22:22.938
[scoffs]
What charity is that?

22:22.940 --> 22:24.739
Oh, it's the one, you know,

22:24.741 --> 22:26.674
everyone's talking about.
It's uh...

22:26.676 --> 22:28.878
They're helping out with
all sorts of stuff. You know?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.078
Kids...
[clears throat]

22:30.080 --> 22:32.148
...water, literacy,

22:32.150 --> 22:34.549
- dolphins.
- [Marguerite] Mmm. Dolphins.

22:34.551 --> 22:35.418
Yeah. No, I...

22:35.420 --> 22:37.723
- I love that charity. Of course.
- Right.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.490
I, um, actually have a favor
to ask you,

22:42.492 --> 22:43.558
but I have to pee, so...

22:43.560 --> 22:44.596
- just wait.
- Mm-hm.

22:45.797 --> 22:46.929
[Ivan exhales]

22:46.931 --> 22:48.533
[Marguerite]
Can you hear me peeing?

22:48.965 --> 22:50.032
Yep.

22:50.034 --> 22:52.133
Mm. Gross. Get farther away.

22:52.135 --> 22:53.137
[Ivan] Hm.

22:58.442 --> 23:00.612
[water trickling]

23:02.980 --> 23:05.213
- Thanks.
- Sure.

23:05.215 --> 23:08.049
So, um, I came here,
obviously, for charity.

23:08.051 --> 23:09.951
- Obviously.
- Thank you.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.220
And, um, because this, uh,

23:12.222 --> 23:15.724
Italian producer guy is making
this thing I want a part in.

23:15.726 --> 23:17.860
But, um, he's just sort of
hitting on me.

23:17.862 --> 23:18.861
- Oh!
- Yeah.

23:18.863 --> 23:21.729
So I, I told him that
my boyfriend was coming.

23:21.731 --> 23:22.797
[Ivan] Okay.

23:22.799 --> 23:24.834
What's the part?

23:24.836 --> 23:27.001
It's, um, too embarrassing
to talk about.

23:27.003 --> 23:28.837
Come on. It's gonna be
a lot easier for me

23:28.839 --> 23:29.904
to be your fake boyfriend

23:29.906 --> 23:31.774
if I knew something
about the part.

23:31.776 --> 23:34.809
Okay. Well, it's an Italian
horror film,

23:34.811 --> 23:37.580
- and I play a witch bride.
- [gasps]

23:37.582 --> 23:38.547
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- [Marguerite sighs]

23:38.549 --> 23:40.482
I'm naked for three-fourths
of the movie.

23:40.484 --> 23:41.584
Ah! A genre picture.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.852
[Marguerite] Mm-hm.

23:42.854 --> 23:43.986
Will you, um...

23:43.988 --> 23:46.788
be my fake boyfriend or not?

23:46.790 --> 23:48.923
- Sure.
- [glasses clink]

23:48.925 --> 23:50.492
[Ivan] Let's see
if we can spot him, eh?

23:50.494 --> 23:51.596
- Okay.
- [Ivan] Hm.

23:52.797 --> 23:54.896
[Ivan sucking teeth]

23:54.898 --> 23:56.265
Is, uh...

23:56.267 --> 23:57.999
that him, six o'clock?

23:58.001 --> 23:59.834
[indistinct chatter]

23:59.836 --> 24:01.636
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

24:01.638 --> 24:02.671
Just seems like him.

24:02.673 --> 24:05.039
Yeah, but there are a lot
of candidates here.

24:05.041 --> 24:07.042
Only three Italian ones.

24:07.044 --> 24:08.576
That guy, and he's not a creep.

24:08.578 --> 24:09.812
- He's almost dead.
- [Marguerite chuckles]

24:09.814 --> 24:12.851
And that guy through there,
and that seems pretty obvious.

24:14.652 --> 24:16.251
What about that guy?

24:16.253 --> 24:19.153
- [Ivan] That guy's Jewish.
- How do you know that?

24:19.155 --> 24:21.289
Okay. That's very impressive.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.624
- Bingo!
- Hmm.

24:22.626 --> 24:23.758
Here comes your boy.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.994
Okay. He thinks
I'm half-Italian.

24:24.996 --> 24:26.795
- You speak Italian?
- Sure. Not really.

24:26.797 --> 24:28.663
- Ah, Giovanni!
- Bella!

24:28.665 --> 24:30.266
- <i>Tutto bene, Giovanni.</i>
- [smooches]

24:30.268 --> 24:32.767
- <i>Bellissimo.</i>
- <i>Buonosera. Ivan.</i>

24:32.769 --> 24:35.703
- <i>Ah, parli Italiano?</i>
- <i>Un pochissimo.</i>

24:35.705 --> 24:37.072
- Ah!
- Is that right?

24:37.074 --> 24:38.707
[speaking Italian]

24:38.709 --> 24:39.842
[both laugh]

24:39.844 --> 24:41.544
Ah, Giovanni
and I were talking earlier

24:41.546 --> 24:43.112
about how beautiful
Paul's house is.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.747
It is gorgeous. Yeah.

24:44.749 --> 24:45.881
Very beautiful.

24:45.883 --> 24:49.552
Uh, how come you, uh, know Paul?

24:49.554 --> 24:51.152
I know Paul
through Marguerite who...

24:51.154 --> 24:53.889
- Uh, Elyse. Through me. Elyse.
- Ah.

24:53.891 --> 24:56.324
Uh, and I introduced you to Paul
at a party in New York.

24:56.326 --> 24:57.959
- Yeah, that party in New York.
- Yeah.

24:57.961 --> 24:59.128
- Mm-hm.
- I remember it very well, yes.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.595
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, Paul. Lovely guy.

25:00.597 --> 25:01.863
- He's kind of...
- Super tall.

25:01.865 --> 25:03.097
- Really tall.
- <i>Altissimo.</i>

25:03.099 --> 25:05.199
Paul. <i>Altissimo. ì, sì.</i>

25:05.201 --> 25:06.669
Paul, <i>grande, eh?</i>

25:06.671 --> 25:07.603
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

25:07.605 --> 25:10.573
Yeah. Eh, so, uh,
friend of friend. Mm.

25:10.575 --> 25:11.974
- Yeah.
- <i>Sì.</i>

25:11.976 --> 25:13.011
Now, um...

25:13.844 --> 25:15.744
The artwork...

25:15.746 --> 25:17.112
- So-so.
- [both] Hm.

25:17.114 --> 25:18.783
Hm, that's a Modigliani.

25:20.284 --> 25:21.616
Ah!

25:21.618 --> 25:22.851
Is he here?

25:22.853 --> 25:24.656
Uh, I think he's dead.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.890
- Oh, good!
- [all chuckle]

25:27.892 --> 25:31.093
Um... Well, I, uh,
leave you alone, eh? Huh?

25:31.095 --> 25:32.827
[speaking Italian]

25:32.829 --> 25:34.630
<i>Salute, salute.</i>

25:34.632 --> 25:35.698
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.798
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- My pleasure.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.865
- Thank you so much.
- Giovanni.

25:37.867 --> 25:40.001
Oh, these hands, eh?
Mine disappear.

25:40.003 --> 25:41.236
- [mumbling]
- [Ivan chuckles]

25:41.238 --> 25:43.639
- A big sailor, right?
- [Ivan chuckles]

25:43.641 --> 25:45.708
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.746
I like the look of that room.
You want to check it out?

25:48.144 --> 25:49.146
Sure.

25:50.780 --> 25:53.815
You, uh, you want a game?

25:53.817 --> 25:55.854
- Yeah.
- How about, uh...

25:56.186 --> 25:57.288
[gulps]

25:57.989 --> 25:59.254
Hundred bucks?

25:59.256 --> 26:00.122
[clicks]

26:00.124 --> 26:02.126
- [beeps]
- [Elyse] How about a thousand?

26:03.259 --> 26:04.328
[Ivan] A thousand?

26:06.631 --> 26:07.666
[inhales deeply]

26:08.098 --> 26:09.664
Why not?

26:09.666 --> 26:11.033
You're not really good, are you?

26:11.035 --> 26:12.037
Eh.
[exhales]

26:12.836 --> 26:14.071
You're full of shit.

26:15.205 --> 26:17.206
Maybe.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.177
- Six hundred. That's all I got.
- [light tapping]

26:20.744 --> 26:22.279
Uh, can you loosen this?

26:25.750 --> 26:26.750
Sure.

26:27.884 --> 26:29.320
[zipper rasps]

26:29.920 --> 26:30.922
Thanks.

26:38.996 --> 26:40.261
Is that famous?

26:40.263 --> 26:42.264
Yeah. That's Philip Guston.

26:42.266 --> 26:43.931
Mid-'40s, I think.

26:43.933 --> 26:45.668
[Ivan] Originally,
he was an abstract painter,

26:45.670 --> 26:47.268
and then became more figurative.

26:47.270 --> 26:48.804
More political.

26:48.806 --> 26:50.005
Hated Nixon.

26:50.007 --> 26:51.739
- [thuds, clatters]
- [Elyse] Is it, um...

26:51.741 --> 26:52.940
worth anything?

26:52.942 --> 26:53.944
I don't know.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.882
So why are you making
Italian horror movies?

26:59.416 --> 27:02.918
You, um, you know
who Aton Eisenstat is?

27:02.920 --> 27:05.353
- [Ivan] I do not.
- He's a Hollywood producer.

27:05.355 --> 27:07.221
[Elyse] He's about as big
as they get.

27:07.223 --> 27:09.123
Remember how they used
to say, uh...

27:09.125 --> 27:11.125
"You'll never work
in this town again, kid"?

27:11.127 --> 27:13.228
- [Ivan] Sure.
- [clacks]

27:13.230 --> 27:16.864
Well, he says it,
and he means it.

27:16.866 --> 27:18.967
[Elyse] <i>I met him
at an award show party.</i>

27:18.969 --> 27:20.869
- [laughter]
- [Elyse] <i>He was funny.</i>

27:20.871 --> 27:22.705
<i>I had been in two
or three movies.</i>

27:22.707 --> 27:25.908
<i>And I was on some list
called "Actresses to Watch."</i>

27:25.910 --> 27:27.142
<i>I was a bit drunk, and...</i>

27:27.144 --> 27:29.814
<i>he told me we were going
to an after-party at his house.</i>

27:31.182 --> 27:33.114
<i>I was young, and I just...</i>

27:33.116 --> 27:34.415
<i>I didn't know better.</i>

27:34.417 --> 27:36.151
<i>There was no after-party.</i>

27:36.153 --> 27:38.386
[tense music]

27:38.388 --> 27:41.256
<i>I, um, I hid in the bathroom
while he banged on the door,</i>

27:41.258 --> 27:43.926
<i>and then, as soon as I heard him
on the phone,</i>

27:43.928 --> 27:44.996
<i>I bounced.</i>

27:45.962 --> 27:46.964
[chuckles]

27:50.867 --> 27:51.970
[Elyse] Side pocket.

27:53.436 --> 27:54.872
[clacking]

27:56.473 --> 27:57.708
[Ivan] Well.

27:58.275 --> 27:59.908
I think...

27:59.910 --> 28:01.211
- I just got hustled.
- [thuds]

28:02.278 --> 28:04.749
Maybe, or I, um, I got lucky.

28:05.249 --> 28:06.250
Maybe.

28:08.384 --> 28:09.421
Can you, um...

28:11.288 --> 28:12.289
Sure.

28:13.324 --> 28:14.959
[zipper rasps]

28:16.861 --> 28:18.927
- How do I look?
- [door opens]

28:18.929 --> 28:21.066
[Giovanni]
Ah, there you are, Bella.

28:21.832 --> 28:24.032
[speaking Italian]

28:24.034 --> 28:25.933
I look for you everywhere.

28:25.935 --> 28:27.271
Big house.
[chuckles]

28:28.939 --> 28:30.939
[Elyse] Thank you, sweetie.
I'll see you in there.

28:30.941 --> 28:31.942
Indeed, sweetheart.

28:32.442 --> 28:33.508
[both chuckle]

28:33.510 --> 28:35.043
You kids have a great time.

28:35.045 --> 28:37.478
I want to introduce you
to my rich friend...

28:37.480 --> 28:39.014
Ah, <i>sì. Grazie.</i>

28:39.016 --> 28:41.350
<i>Que bello.</i>

28:41.352 --> 28:42.884
- [Giovanni] Ivano.
- Hm?

28:42.886 --> 28:46.955
<i>Ah, un amico, vuoi un cocktail,</i>
vino, champagne?

28:46.957 --> 28:52.260
[speaking Italian]

28:52.262 --> 28:53.862
- Okay.
- <i>Aspettiamo.</i>

28:53.864 --> 28:55.063
Ciao.

28:55.065 --> 28:56.465
[Giovanni] Oh, Jonka!

28:56.467 --> 28:57.469
[door closes]

29:00.971 --> 29:01.972
[doorknob clicks]

[Ivan clears throat]

31:01.191 --> 31:02.192
[knocking]

31:04.929 --> 31:06.264
- [Ivan] Hey.
- Hey. Come on.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.299
- Gentlemen.
- Ivan!

31:11.301 --> 31:13.367
- Come on in.
- Jesus.

31:13.369 --> 31:15.202
I don't wanna hear any of this.

31:15.204 --> 31:17.372
I'm trying to run
a real estate business here.

31:17.374 --> 31:18.606
<i>We are trying to run a business.</i>

31:18.608 --> 31:20.374
There wouldn't be any business
without me.

31:20.376 --> 31:22.244
The clowns don't run the circus.

31:22.246 --> 31:23.312
[Dimitri] What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

31:23.314 --> 31:24.412
You know what it means.

31:24.414 --> 31:25.983
- [Dimitri] Shut up!
- You shut up!

31:28.152 --> 31:29.153
[Ivan sighs]

31:31.622 --> 31:33.555
Philip Guston.

31:33.557 --> 31:35.590
- Beautiful!
- [Ivan] Mm-hm.

31:35.592 --> 31:37.191
Looks like a kid did it.

31:37.193 --> 31:38.626
My brother is a dilettante.

31:38.628 --> 31:40.295
You and me, we understand.

31:40.297 --> 31:41.363
"You and I."

31:41.365 --> 31:42.530
How much do you think
it's worth?

31:42.532 --> 31:44.732
Hmm... It's hard to say.

31:44.734 --> 31:47.201
I think at an auction house,
up to five.

31:47.203 --> 31:49.103
But privately,
between one and two.

31:49.105 --> 31:51.174
What did we say your end was?
We said 30K, right?

31:53.109 --> 31:54.177
We said 50.

31:58.214 --> 31:59.981
Nah, I'm just fuckin' with ya.

31:59.983 --> 32:02.217
Believe me, you're gonna get
all your money.

32:02.219 --> 32:04.151
[snickers]

32:04.153 --> 32:06.988
Pay attention. I have something
else for you. Another job,

32:06.990 --> 32:09.024
kind of special.

32:09.026 --> 32:12.661
This is the self-portrait
of Adolf Hitler.

32:12.663 --> 32:13.761
[Dimitri] First thing
he ever did.

32:13.763 --> 32:15.063
[breathes deeply]

32:15.065 --> 32:16.597
Who's the client?

32:16.599 --> 32:18.499
Benny Green, Power View.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.168
[Dimitri] I guess he wants
to burn it or something.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.702
Ah, I get it. Who owns it?

32:21.704 --> 32:23.471
[Dimitri] This guy, John Wolfe.

32:23.473 --> 32:25.609
He lives deep in the Sierras
up by Mammoth.

32:26.509 --> 32:27.642
This guy made...

32:27.644 --> 32:30.045
wheelbarrows full of money
in textiles,

32:30.047 --> 32:31.546
and then he wound up buying
half of Manhattan.

32:31.548 --> 32:33.547
He owns a very
considerable collection

32:33.549 --> 32:35.383
of Nazi war memorabilia.

32:35.385 --> 32:37.753
Now as you or may not know,

32:37.755 --> 32:40.488
Hitler fancied himself
an artist.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.257
He applied to the Institute.
He got rejected.

32:43.259 --> 32:45.026
And I think we know
the end of that story.

32:45.028 --> 32:45.961
Mm-hm.

32:45.963 --> 32:47.629
[sucks teeth]
So where does he keep it?

32:47.631 --> 32:48.764
[Dimitri] On his property.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.731
Uh-huh.
What's the security like?

32:50.733 --> 32:52.169
Well, that's the thing.

32:52.769 --> 32:53.736
What's the thing?

32:53.738 --> 32:55.703
The thing is,
there really is no security.

32:55.705 --> 32:57.671
I mean, there's no alarm,
there's no surveillance.

32:57.673 --> 32:59.306
It's just him...

32:59.308 --> 33:02.643
living alone
with these two dogs.

33:02.645 --> 33:05.613
He keeps the Nazi stuff
in this kind of a war room

33:05.615 --> 33:08.083
because he holds a lot
of media mogul shit up there.

33:08.085 --> 33:09.785
And the whole thing
would be, uh...

33:09.787 --> 33:12.687
for want of a better word,
sort of verboten, you know?

33:12.689 --> 33:14.325
- [Ivan] Oh, yeah?
- And listen.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.459
This one is big.

33:17.461 --> 33:18.794
[Dimitri] I mean, big.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.828
You bring the Hitler to me,

33:20.830 --> 33:24.001
you do one more little job,
a candy from a baby thing,

33:24.835 --> 33:26.500
and that's it.

33:26.502 --> 33:28.405
You and me are done.

33:31.674 --> 33:32.740
Actually done?

33:32.742 --> 33:35.546
Like totally
and completely done.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.548
All right. Uh...

33:39.583 --> 33:41.119
What's... What's my cut?

33:41.484 --> 33:42.586
500K.

33:43.619 --> 33:45.286
This guy is an absolute nut.

33:45.288 --> 33:47.588
He will do anything
to get this piece.

33:47.590 --> 33:51.258
$500,000. I'm in
and then I'm out. We're done.

33:51.260 --> 33:52.827
Well, there is something
you should know.

33:52.829 --> 33:54.097
[Ivan] Okay, what?

33:54.730 --> 33:56.698
Back when he was in Nam,

33:56.700 --> 33:58.432
Wolfe liked to sleep
in the nude.

33:58.434 --> 34:01.335
So, one night, Charlie rolls
a bunch of grenades

34:01.337 --> 34:03.270
into this DMZ camp...

34:03.272 --> 34:05.739
- <i>Wolfe grabs two Browning 9 mm.</i>
- [rapid gunshots]

34:05.741 --> 34:06.841
[Dimitri]
<i>He slips out of his tent.</i>

34:06.843 --> 34:10.579
- <i>He executes 11 VC personally.</i>
- [explosion]

34:10.581 --> 34:13.414
[Dimitri] <i>Thirteen bullets
in each clip. That's 26 bullets.</i>

34:13.416 --> 34:15.617
<i>Eleven dead. Two shots a piece.</i>

34:15.619 --> 34:17.786
<i>One to the chest,
one to the head.</i>

34:17.788 --> 34:19.786
<i>He only misfired four bullets.</i>

34:19.789 --> 34:23.126
<i>All in the dead of night.
Totally in the nude.</i>

34:24.161 --> 34:25.525
<i>This guy's got Purple Hearts.</i>

34:25.527 --> 34:27.362
<i>He's got Silver Stars.
Everything.</i>

34:27.364 --> 34:29.362
[Eric] <i>You love that part
about him being nude.</i>

34:29.364 --> 34:30.802
Fuck you.
It was in <i>Time magazine.</i>

34:33.503 --> 34:35.202
How's the blood pressure?

34:35.204 --> 34:37.237
How does it look?

34:37.239 --> 34:39.273
[Eric] Like you swallowed
a grenade.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.277
I haven't done any blow
in over a year.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.284
[upbeat music]

34:48.851 --> 34:50.485
[Eric] I'm proud of you.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.552
Thank you.

34:51.554 --> 34:53.655
[phone rings]

34:53.657 --> 34:55.190
Hello.

34:55.192 --> 34:56.224
[Dimitri] Yeah. I know. Later.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.159
[Ivan] Okay. I gotta
hit the head before I go.

34:58.161 --> 34:59.360
- [Dimitri] Hold on one second.
- Wait! No...

34:59.362 --> 35:01.195
That one is...

35:01.197 --> 35:02.731
- out of commission.
- No, no, it's fine.

35:02.733 --> 35:03.868
It's okay.
He could use that once.

35:05.434 --> 35:06.436
Okay.

35:08.237 --> 35:10.107
[retreating footsteps]

35:27.958 --> 35:30.260
- Jesus.
- [clinking]

35:37.367 --> 35:39.537
[ominous music]

35:45.608 --> 35:47.675
I had a little bloody nose
back in there before.

35:47.677 --> 35:48.778
Sorry about that.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.415
Yeah, I saw that.

35:52.849 --> 35:54.749
Come home and see the old man?

35:54.751 --> 35:56.851
Yeah. That's right.

35:56.853 --> 35:57.889
Long time ago.

35:58.922 --> 36:01.623
Andrew Wyeth, 1950.

36:01.625 --> 36:03.793
First job your father ever did
for me, actually.

36:05.461 --> 36:08.229
[Dimitri]
I put it up in his honor.

36:08.231 --> 36:10.565
Something tells me you think
you should own it.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.434
No, I didn't say that.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.969
You didn't have to.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.706
You've got that vindictive,
moralistic look on your face.

36:17.474 --> 36:18.543
I feel it.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.778
You know what?

36:23.780 --> 36:25.950
I'm sorry
about your father. Truly.

36:27.483 --> 36:28.550
But that's spilled milk already.

36:28.552 --> 36:30.188
No use in crying
over it now, right?

36:31.021 --> 36:32.223
[Dimitri] Eric.

36:33.556 --> 36:35.289
We really should get to work.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.295
[foreboding music]

36:39.762 --> 36:40.764
Sure.

36:43.432 --> 36:45.436
[tense music]

36:45.902 --> 36:47.471
[door opens]

36:48.405 --> 36:49.407
[door closes]

36:51.574 --> 36:53.577
[birds chirping]

36:59.548 --> 37:00.617
Michael!

37:02.885 --> 37:04.422
What the fuck?

37:08.458 --> 37:10.891
Michael, get the fuck down here
right now!

37:10.893 --> 37:12.726
[Lyman] So, this here's
the original, huh?

37:12.728 --> 37:14.729
Yes.

37:14.731 --> 37:16.865
How long before you knew
it was missing?

37:16.867 --> 37:17.868
Yesterday.

37:18.534 --> 37:19.603
I see.

37:21.304 --> 37:22.804
I'm sorry. Um...

37:22.806 --> 37:24.938
Do you think you're gonna
be able to find this?

37:24.940 --> 37:25.942
I doubt it.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.811
I mean,
it'll resurface somewhere.

37:29.813 --> 37:31.713
Gray market, usually.

37:31.715 --> 37:34.648
There's a 2% recovery rate
for high-profile pieces.

37:34.650 --> 37:37.052
Oh, well, that's encouraging.

37:37.054 --> 37:38.887
Yeah. It's basically
shaking parts

37:38.889 --> 37:41.088
outta sheets at this point.

37:41.090 --> 37:44.525
[Lyman] We'd have an easier time
finding the tooth fairy.

37:44.527 --> 37:47.494
Hey, look,
I know you spoke to the LAPD,

37:47.496 --> 37:50.065
but I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.333
Anybody at this party
we don't know?

37:52.335 --> 37:53.834
Say, uh...

37:53.836 --> 37:57.072
caterers, valet, uh, staff?

37:57.074 --> 37:59.340
I mean, these things
are usually inside baseball.

37:59.342 --> 38:00.641
No. No, we knew everyone.

38:00.643 --> 38:02.279
It was all of our regulars.

38:03.045 --> 38:04.112
Okay.

38:04.114 --> 38:05.713
[girl] Excuse me.

38:05.715 --> 38:08.650
Who's the guy
who can fix the rug?

38:08.652 --> 38:09.751
What's that now, dear?

38:09.753 --> 38:11.720
Who's the guy who took the rug?

38:11.722 --> 38:13.924
He told me to bring a drink
to that lady.

38:14.724 --> 38:16.458
Mr. Brooks,

38:16.460 --> 38:19.463
do you suppose you could provide
me with a guest list?

38:27.971 --> 38:29.005
Thanks.

38:36.413 --> 38:38.349
[man 7] Oh!
Burning the midnight oil?

38:40.384 --> 38:42.851
- It's seven o'clock.
- Yeah. No shit it is.

38:42.853 --> 38:44.952
Kings tickets. On the glass.
And I'm late.

38:44.954 --> 38:46.054
- [drawer thuds]
- [sighs]

38:46.056 --> 38:47.090
[man 7] Suck it!

39:03.639 --> 39:05.675
[clanks]

39:08.911 --> 39:12.782
[trickling]

39:15.952 --> 39:17.822
[Lyman] Jive-ass motherfucker.

39:23.626 --> 39:25.628
[suspenseful music]

39:29.800 --> 39:31.602
[crickets chirping]

39:43.713 --> 39:46.984
[dogs barking]

39:51.621 --> 39:53.523
[rasping]

39:56.525 --> 39:58.561
- [dogs barking]
- [rustling]

40:01.597 --> 40:03.067
- [light thudding]
- [rustling]

40:04.768 --> 40:06.637
[dogs barking]

40:10.172 --> 40:12.174
[dogs sniffing]

40:16.045 --> 40:18.047
[suspenseful music]

40:25.554 --> 40:28.792
[dogs barking in distance]

40:39.768 --> 40:42.138
[barking continues]

40:46.576 --> 40:47.842
[blows air]

40:47.844 --> 40:48.979
[slurps]

40:50.280 --> 40:51.482
[spoon clinks]

40:54.885 --> 40:56.887
[suspenseful music]

41:04.661 --> 41:06.096
[dogs barking]

41:07.864 --> 41:10.034
[dog whimpers in distance]

41:14.103 --> 41:16.473
[foreboding music]

41:28.050 --> 41:30.054
[tense music]

41:34.557 --> 41:35.559
[whistles]

41:39.061 --> 41:41.065
[suspenseful music]

41:48.905 --> 41:50.007
[cocks gun]

41:55.612 --> 41:56.614
[glass shatters]

42:01.617 --> 42:03.251
[gun clicks, cocks]

42:03.253 --> 42:04.521
[rustling in distance]

42:06.356 --> 42:08.559
[ominous music]

42:12.128 --> 42:14.131
[suspenseful music]

42:36.385 --> 42:38.255
[engine rumbling]

42:51.934 --> 42:52.936
[wood cracks]

43:02.344 --> 43:03.346
[Ivan] Bingo.

43:18.293 --> 43:19.329
[John] Motherfucker.

43:21.998 --> 43:23.266
[rustling]

43:32.976 --> 43:34.979
[suspenseful music]

43:47.190 --> 43:48.258
[doorbell buzzing]

43:54.197 --> 43:55.365
[buzzing continues]

43:57.233 --> 43:58.865
[Ivan clears throat]

43:58.867 --> 44:00.371
- Hello.
- Hi.

44:01.804 --> 44:02.873
[Elyse] <i>It's Elyse.</i>

44:03.806 --> 44:06.042
Uh, hey.

44:07.143 --> 44:08.144
[Ivan] <i>Uh...</i>

44:09.079 --> 44:10.378
Can I come up?

44:10.380 --> 44:13.384
Uh, of course. Yeah, uh, yup.

44:14.416 --> 44:16.152
Fuck. Shit.

44:17.753 --> 44:19.119
[Ivan] <i>Yeah, I'm buzzing you.</i>

44:19.121 --> 44:20.755
[door buzzing]

44:20.757 --> 44:21.889
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

44:21.891 --> 44:22.893
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

44:24.927 --> 44:25.929
[light thudding]

44:29.331 --> 44:31.965
- Hi.
- [Elyse] Hi.

44:31.967 --> 44:34.034
I, um,
I scratched on my eight ball.

44:34.036 --> 44:35.302
Ah. You did.

44:35.304 --> 44:36.938
I thought
we could talk about it.

44:36.940 --> 44:40.407
Sure, we can talk about it.
Yeah, um, how did you...

44:40.409 --> 44:42.744
- How did you find me?
- Oh, um...

44:42.746 --> 44:44.445
I, uh, looked in
your wallet that night.

44:44.447 --> 44:48.148
Oh, okay, nice. Shit, um...

44:48.150 --> 44:51.251
Rematch? Down the street,
great bar, great table.

44:51.253 --> 44:52.787
- Sure, yeah.
- [Ivan] Great. Okay.

44:52.789 --> 44:54.287
- Okay.
- [Ivan] Just give me one second.

44:54.289 --> 44:55.356
Stay right there.

44:55.358 --> 44:57.161
Like in the hallway? Don't...

44:58.228 --> 44:59.327
- Mm-hm.
- [Elyse] Okay.

44:59.329 --> 45:00.931
- Yeah.
- That's... okay.

45:08.471 --> 45:09.804
[door clatters]

45:09.806 --> 45:10.871
- [Elyse] Mm.
- Ready to go?

45:10.873 --> 45:12.442
- [Elyse] Yeah.
- [Ivan] Okay.

45:15.277 --> 45:16.376
So,

45:16.378 --> 45:19.847
something I was thinking about
this, uh, Aton guy,

45:19.849 --> 45:21.449
you know, the dickhead producer.

45:21.451 --> 45:22.450
Yup.

45:22.452 --> 45:24.985
I don't get it.
I mean, he's blackmailing you

45:24.987 --> 45:26.052
because you turned him down?

45:26.054 --> 45:26.987
Am I missing something?

45:26.989 --> 45:29.959
Well, I may have left out
the epilogue.

45:31.193 --> 45:33.327
[Elyse]
<i>I, um, I did something dumb.</i>

45:33.329 --> 45:35.362
<i>Probably out of shame or spite.</i>

45:35.364 --> 45:36.930
<i>I stole
the sweetest little necklace</i>

45:36.932 --> 45:38.999
<i>off of Mrs. Eisenstadt's vanity.</i>

45:39.001 --> 45:40.400
[Ivan] Hmm.

45:40.402 --> 45:43.470
Yeah. I also did something else.

45:43.472 --> 45:44.738
[Elyse]
<i>I don't think married women</i>

45:44.740 --> 45:47.407
<i>like finding other girls'
panties in their hamper.</i>

45:47.409 --> 45:51.211
<i>Anyway, um, it turned out to be
one of those award show loaners.</i>

45:51.213 --> 45:52.947
<i>It was worth 250,000.</i>

45:52.949 --> 45:55.249
<i>Problem was I sold it
to a Serbian named Milos</i>

45:55.251 --> 45:56.550
<i>for $50,000.</i>

45:56.552 --> 45:58.385
<i>Two weeks later, Aton calls me</i>

45:58.387 --> 46:00.121
<i>and says I'd stolen
from the wrong guy</i>

46:00.123 --> 46:02.123
<i>and I owe him $250,000.</i>

46:02.125 --> 46:04.825
<i>And when I said, "Or what?"
he said,</i>

46:04.827 --> 46:07.161
<i>"You'll never work
in this town again, kid."</i>

46:07.163 --> 46:09.496
The next thing you know,
your manager has dropped you,

46:09.498 --> 46:12.133
your agent
won't call you back, and...

46:12.135 --> 46:13.967
you're stripping in Palmdale.

46:13.969 --> 46:15.836
- [Ivan] Where's Palmdale?
- Exactly.

46:15.838 --> 46:17.137
It's off the 14.

46:17.139 --> 46:18.206
[Ivan] Oh.

46:18.208 --> 46:21.175
So, can you buy your way out?

46:21.177 --> 46:22.376
That's what I've been
trying to do.

46:22.378 --> 46:24.979
One Italian horror movie
at a time.

46:24.981 --> 46:28.249
I, um, I still owe him $200,000,

46:28.251 --> 46:32.186
or as he likes to say,
"400 million lira."

46:32.188 --> 46:33.521
You, um, you don't happen
to have that

46:33.523 --> 46:34.988
lying around, do you?

46:34.990 --> 46:36.293
Not in lira, no.

46:39.862 --> 46:42.028
That was a good game.
You win fair and square.

46:42.030 --> 46:43.898
No, no. Keep it. We're even.

46:43.900 --> 46:45.066
- [Elyse] Hm.
- Um,

46:45.068 --> 46:47.400
there is one thing, though,
and you know, hear me out.

46:47.402 --> 46:50.304
This may sound
a little crazy, but...

46:50.306 --> 46:55.175
would you be interested
in helping me out, uh...

46:55.177 --> 46:57.478
you know, returning
the fake boyfriend favor?

46:57.480 --> 46:59.045
- How so?
- [Ivan] Well,

46:59.047 --> 47:00.514
you're an actress, right?

47:00.516 --> 47:01.715
- Sure.
- Well,

47:01.717 --> 47:05.519
would you be interested in
becoming a potential home buyer

47:05.521 --> 47:07.153
in the greater Costa Mesa area?

47:07.155 --> 47:08.222
[Elyse] Absolutely not,

47:08.224 --> 47:09.557
but it sounds like
that's the part.

47:09.559 --> 47:11.191
Yeah, that's the part.

47:11.193 --> 47:13.163
I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

47:15.297 --> 47:16.299
Maybe.

47:19.202 --> 47:22.068
What's, um, in the house?

47:22.070 --> 47:23.170
[Ivan] Now, I gotta figure out

47:23.172 --> 47:24.405
if there's something
in there or not.

47:24.407 --> 47:25.409
[Elyse] Hm.

47:27.409 --> 47:28.976
When?

47:28.978 --> 47:30.577
Next weekend.

47:30.579 --> 47:32.382
And, um, how should I dress?

47:34.150 --> 47:35.516
Well, you should dress like

47:35.518 --> 47:38.322
someone who wants to buy a house
in Costa Mesa, I guess.

47:40.456 --> 47:42.593
That's helpful. Good game.

47:44.594 --> 47:45.896
I'll see you then.

47:47.597 --> 47:48.599
[Ivan] Mm-hm.

47:51.567 --> 47:52.633
Bye.

47:52.635 --> 47:54.702
[door opens]

47:54.704 --> 47:56.440
- I'm just gonna hang here.
- [door closes]

47:57.139 --> 47:58.174
You know,

47:59.509 --> 48:00.510
chill.

48:04.380 --> 48:06.383
[foreboding music]

48:10.119 --> 48:11.989
[car engine starts]

48:26.402 --> 48:27.670
[car engine starts]

48:41.117 --> 48:43.019
[whirring]

48:44.086 --> 48:45.588
[clicking]

48:49.559 --> 48:50.994
[clicking continues]

48:54.396 --> 48:57.333
[Ray breathes deeply]

48:58.601 --> 49:00.137
You wanna hear a funny story?

49:04.639 --> 49:06.009
Have a peek at that.

49:08.643 --> 49:10.311
What is this?

49:10.313 --> 49:12.380
[Ray] That's
the <i>Larchmont Charter.</i>

49:12.382 --> 49:15.215
It's the best. You gotta read
your local paper, Ivan.

49:15.217 --> 49:18.519
North of the crease,
east of the fold.

49:18.521 --> 49:21.421
A 40-year-old fella found dead
in the L.A. River.

49:21.423 --> 49:24.657
No history of drugs. No priors.
Beaten, tortured.

49:24.659 --> 49:27.293
Shot in the head. No survivors.

49:27.295 --> 49:29.764
Skip to the last paragraph.
Went to Cal Arts.

49:29.766 --> 49:31.201
Worked at the museums.

49:32.568 --> 49:33.570
Do you know him?

49:35.605 --> 49:37.137
No.

49:37.139 --> 49:40.106
- Never seen him before.
- [Ray] Huh.

49:40.108 --> 49:43.510
Anyway, uh, I gotta finish this
and then get back to work.

49:43.512 --> 49:45.278
You gotta punch the clock, huh?

49:45.280 --> 49:47.048
[Ivan] Yup.

49:47.050 --> 49:48.382
Back to the salt mines.

49:48.384 --> 49:49.784
Nose to the stones.
Is that right?

49:49.786 --> 49:51.818
Exactly. What the fuck
are you asking me, Ray?

49:51.820 --> 49:53.356
I don't know, man. I don't know.

49:54.590 --> 49:56.157
I don't know.

49:56.159 --> 49:58.224
I mean, I haven't been around,
but this seems to me

49:58.226 --> 50:01.162
like maybe you're trying
to clean up one of Dad's messes.

50:01.164 --> 50:03.266
Yeah? Well, I think
that's the way it works.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.568
Got it. Well...
[slurps]

50:07.070 --> 50:08.501
...read your local paper.

50:08.503 --> 50:10.072
Keep your head on a swivel.

50:11.740 --> 50:13.773
And here.

50:13.775 --> 50:16.077
- Look what I dug up.
- What the fuck is that?

50:16.079 --> 50:17.744
Dad's gun.

50:17.746 --> 50:19.280
Why the fuck
have you got Dad's gun?

50:19.282 --> 50:20.347
I don't want that.

50:20.349 --> 50:21.514
Well, now, see,

50:21.516 --> 50:22.583
I do, but I don't think

50:22.585 --> 50:24.452
I'm the one
that really needs it.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.220
[Ray] You know how to use that?

50:26.222 --> 50:28.322
Manual's in the box.

50:28.324 --> 50:30.159
How's your German?
Mine's a bit rusty.

50:32.461 --> 50:33.630
[Ray grunts]

50:34.496 --> 50:35.531
[gun clicks]

50:37.632 --> 50:39.135
I think it goes the other way.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.369
[Ray] Oh, by the way,
there's a fella in a Crown Vic

50:43.371 --> 50:45.438
on the corner there.

50:45.440 --> 50:46.675
He's been there all morning.

50:48.344 --> 50:49.409
Probably nothin'.

50:49.411 --> 50:50.579
[gun clicking]

51:02.891 --> 51:05.094
[machine chiming]

51:05.661 --> 51:07.364
[beeping]

51:10.666 --> 51:12.501

51:13.735 --> 51:14.737
[beeps]

51:18.875 --> 51:21.641
[foreboding music]

51:21.643 --> 51:24.146
[indistinct chatter]

51:25.313 --> 51:26.880
- [dealer] Big blind?
- Sure.

51:26.882 --> 51:28.414
How much behind?

51:28.416 --> 51:30.286
- [Elyse] 500.
- [dealer] Chips, 500.

51:32.221 --> 51:33.222
Thank you.

51:34.590 --> 51:36.093
Continue, five.

51:36.659 --> 51:37.760
To your right.

51:44.599 --> 51:45.601
Call.

51:48.403 --> 51:50.938
Uh, raise. Make it 110.

51:50.940 --> 51:52.639
- [dealer] Raise 100?
- [Elyse] All in.

51:52.641 --> 51:53.876
[dealer] The lady is all in.

51:54.777 --> 51:55.943
[player] I'll fold.

51:55.945 --> 51:57.478
[dealer] Looks like
it's up to you, sir.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.912
I'm laying the deal.

51:58.914 --> 52:00.117
He calls.

52:04.554 --> 52:05.588
[Elyse] Run 'em.

52:12.460 --> 52:13.562
[dealer] Good luck, everybody.

52:17.867 --> 52:19.269
[dealer] Set of kings wins.

52:20.503 --> 52:21.505
Sorry.

52:22.371 --> 52:23.606
Can I get one of those?

52:26.742 --> 52:27.911
Good luck. Bad beat.

52:32.748 --> 52:34.550
[crowd cheering]

52:37.452 --> 52:38.721
[man laughing]

52:39.688 --> 52:42.224
[indistinct chatter]

52:42.925 --> 52:44.928
[crowd cheering]

52:50.900 --> 52:53.800
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

52:53.802 --> 52:56.570
Hey, little lady.
You watchin' or you playin'?

52:56.572 --> 52:58.706
Well, I don't know.
What should I do?

52:58.708 --> 52:59.874
I think you oughta play.

52:59.876 --> 53:00.941
Why don't you come over here
and let Big Daddy show you

53:00.943 --> 53:01.842
- how to do this, all right?
- [Elyse] All right.

53:01.844 --> 53:05.746
- Now, you blow on them dice.
- Oh, okay.

53:05.748 --> 53:06.847
- That's it. All right.
- Uh-huh.

53:06.849 --> 53:08.282
Gimme a yo, Adrian.

53:08.284 --> 53:10.416
Here we go. Comin' out now.
Comin' out.

53:10.418 --> 53:11.284
[crowd cheering]

53:11.286 --> 53:12.619
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

53:12.621 --> 53:14.255
No, whoa, whoa, where you going?

53:14.257 --> 53:15.688
- You're my good luck.
- Oh.

53:15.690 --> 53:17.258
You don't need good luck.

53:17.260 --> 53:19.260
You know I don't.
Gimme a drink over here.

53:19.262 --> 53:20.228
Come on now.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.465
All right. Comin' out again.
Hot potatoes!

53:23.699 --> 53:24.967
- Hey, Janice.
- Hey.

53:25.900 --> 53:27.536
I'd use the north exit.

53:28.403 --> 53:29.336
Really?

53:29.338 --> 53:31.871
Yeah. The front's crawling
with security.

53:31.873 --> 53:33.309
All right. Thank you.

53:33.809 --> 53:35.342
How are you?

53:35.344 --> 53:36.876
Every day
is better than the last.

53:36.878 --> 53:37.880
[Elyse] Hmm.

53:40.782 --> 53:43.650
[Elyse] <i>I feel
the exact same way.</i>

53:43.652 --> 53:44.751
[Janice] <i>All right, girl.
Good luck.</i>

53:44.753 --> 53:45.755
[Elyse] <i>You too.</i>

53:51.726 --> 53:53.730
[foreboding music]

53:59.302 --> 54:00.804
[keys jangling]

54:06.909 --> 54:08.508
Your money is in there.

54:08.510 --> 54:10.579
That parking's
reserved for executives.

54:11.347 --> 54:12.449
They'll tell you.

54:13.648 --> 54:14.981
Great dress.

54:14.983 --> 54:16.816
Bet it looked better last night.

54:16.818 --> 54:18.052
[scoffs]

54:18.054 --> 54:19.353
[car alarm beeps]

54:19.355 --> 54:20.523
[Aton] Yo, you got 'em?

54:21.090 --> 54:23.460
[clanking]

54:24.893 --> 54:26.895
[foreboding music]

54:30.800 --> 54:32.602
[car engine starts]

54:37.373 --> 54:38.474
[Ivan] Gentlemen.

54:39.007 --> 54:40.641
How'd it go?

54:40.643 --> 54:42.976
Well, I'm alive.

54:42.978 --> 54:45.612
So, where is Hitler? You're
walking with both arms swinging.

54:45.614 --> 54:47.981
Yeah. That's, uh...

54:47.983 --> 54:49.717
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

54:49.719 --> 54:50.987
I don't like the sound of this.

54:52.355 --> 54:54.621
There was a... complication.

54:54.623 --> 54:55.688
What are you talking about?

54:55.690 --> 54:57.891
[sighs, clicks tongue]

54:57.893 --> 54:59.892
I'm talking about the FBI.
They're on to me.

54:59.894 --> 55:01.695
One agent in particular.

55:01.697 --> 55:04.831
No! No, no, no! Goddamn it, no!

55:04.833 --> 55:06.368
[Dimitri]
This is not the way this goes.

55:07.469 --> 55:08.336
Did you talk to this guy?

55:08.338 --> 55:09.302
No, of course,
I didn't talk to him.

55:09.304 --> 55:11.637
So, how do you know for sure
that he's FBI?

55:11.639 --> 55:13.539
Because he has
a government license plate,

55:13.541 --> 55:15.708
and he doesn't exactly look
like a census worker.

55:15.710 --> 55:16.779
[Dimitri] Jesus!

55:18.447 --> 55:19.248
[cocks gun]

55:20.815 --> 55:23.583
Jesus fucking Christ.
What is this?

55:23.585 --> 55:25.084
This is me.

55:25.086 --> 55:26.987
And I am telling you

55:26.989 --> 55:31.157
that you are gonna come clean,
100%, right fucking now.

55:31.159 --> 55:32.159
[Ivan] Okay.

55:32.161 --> 55:36.162
I didn't talk to him.
I would never do that.

55:36.164 --> 55:37.798
Why are you pointing
a gun in my face?

55:37.800 --> 55:40.601
You are making me
point this gun in your face.

55:40.603 --> 55:42.338
Aren't you forgetting something,
Dimitri?

55:43.639 --> 55:45.505
- Where is Hitler?
- I have him.

55:45.507 --> 55:46.875
Why didn't you bring him?
Why isn't he here?

55:47.742 --> 55:48.744
For insurance.

55:51.914 --> 55:54.180
You do realize you're kind of
out of your depth here, right?

55:54.182 --> 55:56.450
Yeah, I'm becoming
more aware of that.

55:56.452 --> 55:58.017
Listen to me.
[chuckles]

55:58.019 --> 55:59.887
There was never gonna be
any kind of shooting at all.

55:59.889 --> 56:02.923
This was me, testing you.

56:02.925 --> 56:05.691
- Believe me, it's all fine.
- [Ivan] Okay.

56:05.693 --> 56:06.730
It's fine.

56:09.465 --> 56:12.465
It... It's...
It's for the splatter.

56:12.467 --> 56:14.168
There was never gonna be
any fucking splatter.

56:14.170 --> 56:16.068
Okay, I'm getting outta here.

56:16.070 --> 56:17.139
Wait! Wait!

56:20.842 --> 56:22.508
What is this?

56:22.510 --> 56:24.043
[Dimitri]
That is your last hurrah.

56:24.045 --> 56:25.746
I've made you
a shitload of money.

56:25.748 --> 56:26.813
I'm letting you out
the back door,

56:26.815 --> 56:28.449
which is something I do not do.

56:28.451 --> 56:30.050
[Dimitri] Get me that sculpture
that's being fenced

56:30.052 --> 56:31.084
in that safe house.

56:31.086 --> 56:34.887
You bring me Hitler,
and that's it. That's it.

56:34.889 --> 56:36.956
[Dimitri] We call it a day.

56:36.958 --> 56:39.461
It's <i>The Nose by Giacometti.</i>
You know it?

56:41.530 --> 56:42.896
Never heard of it. No.

56:42.898 --> 56:44.401
[Dimitri] Well, it's a big deal.

56:44.800 --> 56:45.802
Great.

56:48.903 --> 56:49.905
[Dimitri] Ivan.

56:52.942 --> 56:53.943
Take care.

57:03.518 --> 57:05.521
[foreboding music]

57:24.739 --> 57:26.542
[car engine revs]

57:51.699 --> 57:52.768
[Ivan] Hey, man.

57:59.074 --> 58:00.476
How's the hash?

58:02.911 --> 58:04.811
That shit was good.

58:04.813 --> 58:06.749
But you should know.
It's your joint.

58:08.083 --> 58:09.586
Seems like you wanna talk.

58:11.019 --> 58:14.220
I didn't think you'd spot me
with this disguise.

58:14.222 --> 58:15.956
[clears throat]

58:15.958 --> 58:18.126
Lyman Wilkers, FBI.

58:20.195 --> 58:23.095
No need to introduce yourself,
Mr. Warding.

58:23.097 --> 58:25.599
- I've taken the liberty.
- [Ivan] Mm-hm.

58:25.601 --> 58:27.034
Why are you following me?

58:27.036 --> 58:29.101
I'm not following you.

58:29.103 --> 58:31.637
I'm watching you.
There's a big difference.

58:31.639 --> 58:34.874
If I was following you,
I'd need taps, surveillance,

58:34.876 --> 58:36.208
signatures from judges.

58:36.210 --> 58:38.811
Well, it kinda seems like
you're following me.

58:38.813 --> 58:40.847
- I'll have a coffee.
- [waitress] You got it.

58:40.849 --> 58:42.215
Look, you're better at this
than me,

58:42.217 --> 58:43.853
so I'll just come clean.

58:45.054 --> 58:46.987
You mind if I come clean?

58:46.989 --> 58:47.990
[Ivan] Please do.

58:50.626 --> 58:51.961
It's not hard to find you.

58:53.929 --> 58:56.662
You get ten dipshits
on the Internet,

58:56.664 --> 58:59.032
and you can find the 50
or 60 guys

58:59.034 --> 59:01.070
who install art
for a living around here.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.338
[Lyman] Let's see here.

59:04.340 --> 59:07.173
Worked for
two private install firms, uh,

59:07.175 --> 59:09.778
Cooper-Beasley
and Montrose Partners,

59:11.112 --> 59:14.081
a couple of museums
after art school.

59:14.083 --> 59:15.849
And you wanna know the truth?

59:15.851 --> 59:18.251
It was an eyewitness.

59:18.253 --> 59:20.222
There is nothin'
like an eyewitness.

59:21.056 --> 59:22.659
Even if it's just a kid.

59:23.759 --> 59:24.860
[rustles]

59:28.831 --> 59:32.132
[Lyman] It's not a bad likeness,
if you ask me.

59:32.134 --> 59:35.401
They got a little fat
in the cheeks, but, uh,

59:35.403 --> 59:37.371
I think that's
the sketch artist's fault.

59:37.373 --> 59:38.639
Not hers.

59:38.641 --> 59:40.641
Yeah, probably.

59:40.643 --> 59:43.776
- What are you asking me?
- [Lyman sighs]

59:43.778 --> 59:47.347
I've been a field agent
for 17 years, and...

59:47.349 --> 59:50.916
I've hit what they call
the black ceiling.

59:50.918 --> 59:53.787
I think it's time for a change.
Maybe...

59:53.789 --> 59:57.891
something inside
with a less municipal car,

59:57.893 --> 59:59.695
and, um...
[soft grunt]

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:03.130
Fuck it, I'm just gonna say it.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:07.333
No more petty shakedowns
with shitheaps like yourself.

01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:10.003
In the past three years, you
and your pals have taken down

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:12.104
over $75 million

01:00:12.106 --> 01:00:14.441
- in gray market art.
- [Ivan clears throat]

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:16.108
Here's the thing.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:17.744
I don't care
if you think you got this

01:00:17.746 --> 01:00:19.012
tighter than a nun's cunt,

01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:21.180
- you gonna slip up.
- [Ivan] Mm-hm.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:23.983
It might not be you.
It might be a...

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:26.452
unstable girlfriend,

01:00:26.454 --> 01:00:30.257
or a bipolar brother.

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.958
But there's always a crack.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.262
[Lyman] Did I mention I've been
doin' this for 17 years?

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:37.030
Yeah. You did.

01:00:37.032 --> 01:00:39.298
That's twice,
and as far as I can tell,

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.900
you have my resumé

01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:43.138
and the testimony
of a four-year-old girl.

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.175
Oh, Ivan.

01:00:50.311 --> 01:00:53.016
I don't seem to remember
telling you she was four.

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.318
[Lyman] Just a good guess,
I suppose.

01:00:57.052 --> 01:00:58.320
[chuckles]

01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:05.391
What do you want from me?

01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:07.195
[Lyman] Let's get
one thing straight.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.929
You're useless.

01:01:09.931 --> 01:01:11.063
I don't care about you.

01:01:11.065 --> 01:01:12.331
You mean nothin' to me.

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:14.200
Unless...

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:16.338
and that's with a capital U,

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.108
you can deliver me
the man with the plan.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.175
'Cause if not,

01:01:23.177 --> 01:01:25.981
it's gonna be my foot
in your ass.

01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:29.251
Hmmm.
[sighs]

01:01:39.094 --> 01:01:40.797
You still got a fax machine?

01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:43.099
Fuck you.

01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:50.907
[door slams]

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:55.411
[cracks]

01:01:59.981 --> 01:02:02.150
[tense music]

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.963
[suspenseful music]

01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:22.369
[Melanie] <i>Well, like I said,
great kitchen.</i>

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.804
<i>Great for cooking meals.</i>

01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:26.539
<i>And the house, I mean,</i>

01:02:26.541 --> 01:02:28.874
<i>unlike a lot of the homes
in Costa Mesa,</i>

01:02:28.876 --> 01:02:30.811
- hasn't been touched in years.
- Mm.

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.412
So, a lot of potential.

01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:34.246
I see it. It's beautiful.

01:02:34.248 --> 01:02:35.315
Ooh.

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:36.449
We lost your boyfriend.

01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:38.385
Um, he'll resurface.
He always does.

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:40.487
- Oh, okay.
- I love your shoes, by the way.

01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:42.454
- Oh, my god, thank you.
- They're beautiful.

01:02:42.456 --> 01:02:43.889
Nordstrom Rack.

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:45.057
- No.
- Yes!

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:47.126
- [scoffs]
- [Melanie chuckles]

01:02:47.128 --> 01:02:49.963
So, anyway, real opportunity
to do something special here.

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:51.463
[Elyse] Mm-hm.

01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:53.599
My boyfriend is impossible.
I don't know where he is.

01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:54.867
- I'm so sorry.
- I heard that.

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:56.836
- Oh, hello.
- Hey.

01:02:56.838 --> 01:02:59.539
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd be calling the movers,

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:02.909
but you know men. He's gonna hem
and haw for two and three weeks.

01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:03.976
[chuckles]
Right?

01:03:03.978 --> 01:03:05.045
- It's true.
- Yeah.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.213
- Thank you so much, Melanie.
- Oh.

01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:08.347
- Thank you, Candace.
- [Elyse chuckles]

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.548
Great to meet you. Thank you.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.617
- It was a pleasure, Terry.
- Uh-huh.

01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:13.221
You're such a cute couple.

01:03:14.956 --> 01:03:16.021
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:03:16.023 --> 01:03:17.090
All right. Have a good day.

01:03:17.092 --> 01:03:17.923
- Thanks. Take care.
- [Elyse] We'll be in touch.

01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:19.394
- [Ivan] Bye-bye.
- [Melanie] Bye-bye.

01:03:23.097 --> 01:03:24.296
[Elyse] <i>Did you find anything?</i>

01:03:24.298 --> 01:03:25.599
Well, I'm definitely
getting set up.

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.900
Is that good?

01:03:26.902 --> 01:03:29.068
[Ivan] Well, it's good to know.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.269
[Elyse] Did you like the house?

01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:31.403
[Ivan] I didn't love it. You?

01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:33.072
No, I thought it was smelly.

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:34.441
Yeah.
It was probably the carpet.

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:36.508
Yeah. I mean,
definitely the carpet.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:37.846
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.229
[engine rumbling]

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.940
[Ivan breathes deeply]

01:04:05.507 --> 01:04:09.943
So, um, I've been meaning
to ask you.

01:04:09.945 --> 01:04:12.512
What, um...
What happened to that painting?

01:04:12.514 --> 01:04:14.213
Uh, which painting?

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:15.282
[scoffs]

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:18.117
Guston, the abstract painter
that got political.

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:19.686
[Elyse] Simple palate.
Hated Nixon.

01:04:19.688 --> 01:04:20.954
- Sense of humor.
- Hm.

01:04:20.956 --> 01:04:22.354
Yeah, that was in the news...

01:04:22.356 --> 01:04:23.423
- Hmm.
- [Elyse] ...Ivan.

01:04:23.425 --> 01:04:24.423
And when I asked you about
how much it was worth,

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.992
you said you didn't know,
so, you're a liar.

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:28.929
No, that's not
technically a lie.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.463
What happened to it?

01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:33.402
You should only ask questions
you want answers for.

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.037
[scoffs]

01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:41.541
They're gonna kill me.

01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:42.641
Who's gonna kill you,
the homeowner?

01:04:42.643 --> 01:04:45.545
No, no. Not the homeowner.
She's a museum trustee.

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:47.380
She's sweet. She's old.
No. The Greek.

01:04:47.382 --> 01:04:49.481
I work for him.
He's gonna kill me.

01:04:49.483 --> 01:04:50.983
- The Greek?
- Yeah.

01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:53.019
Jesus, what is this,
Port Charles?

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.320
[Elyse] What are you
gonna do about it?

01:04:54.322 --> 01:04:58.325
Well, it's complicated,
but, uh, I think...

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.662
I think
I'm gonna kill him first.

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.530
Well, holy fucking shit.
That's complicated.

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:07.333
Yeah. It's a little complex.
Too much?

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:09.135
Um, uh, sort of.

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:11.037
Yeah, I just...
[sucks teeth]

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:12.338
What choice do I have,
you know?

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.307
[Elyse] Ugh,
what are the options?

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:16.476
My options are die or not die.

01:05:16.478 --> 01:05:18.481
Okay. Die or not die, huh.

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:23.115
All right. Well, I want in.

01:05:23.117 --> 01:05:24.450
[chuckles]

01:05:24.452 --> 01:05:26.052
What are you talking about?

01:05:26.054 --> 01:05:28.153
- I want in.
- You want in for what?

01:05:28.155 --> 01:05:32.092
- Well, I don't want you to die.
- Well, that's very sweet of you.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.026
- Come on. You could use my help.
- [clicks tongue]

01:05:34.028 --> 01:05:36.128
No, I'm... I'm good, I think.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.998
Okay. You're being an asshole.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.199
[Elyse]
You, you could use my help.

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.434
[sighs]

01:05:41.436 --> 01:05:43.403
What the fuck makes you think
I want your help?

01:05:43.405 --> 01:05:46.008
I'm not asking for it,
so I don't want it.

01:05:47.641 --> 01:05:49.077
No, no, of course.

01:05:49.643 --> 01:05:50.679
Fuck you!

01:05:53.481 --> 01:05:54.483
[car door slams]

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:57.416
[groans]
Fuck!

01:05:57.418 --> 01:05:58.784
- [horn blows]
- You know what...

01:05:58.786 --> 01:06:00.055
- Fuck!
- [car door slams]

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.755
[Ivan] Wait, wait, wait!

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:04.791
Just wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, please.

01:06:04.793 --> 01:06:06.595
[Ivan breathes deeply]

01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:09.431
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:11.199
Say it again.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.436
I'm sorry.

01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:15.501
Okay.

01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.202
And I am actually sorry.
I'm really sorry.

01:06:17.204 --> 01:06:18.306
You said enough.

01:06:19.106 --> 01:06:20.175
Yeah.

01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:27.179
What if I said
I do need your help?

01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:29.249
[Elyse] <i>I mean,
I'd say you were right.</i>

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.519
<i>And you should say it.</i>

01:06:34.755 --> 01:06:36.224
I need you.

01:06:37.358 --> 01:06:39.726
[Elyse] <i>Well, you're right.</i>

01:06:39.728 --> 01:06:41.030
<i>That's better.</i>

01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:45.664
I, um, I do need a cut.

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:46.666
[grunts]

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:49.668
- There it is!
- I mean, you knew it was coming.

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.271
- Yeah.
- [soft chuckle]

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.742
- Yeah, I guess I kinda did.
- Hmm.

01:07:00.315 --> 01:07:02.318
[suspenseful music]

01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:34.416
[Elyse chuckles softly]

01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:38.753
[clatters in distance]

01:07:41.556 --> 01:07:43.626
[Ray humming]

01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:46.228
[sighs]

01:07:51.298 --> 01:07:52.701
- Uh, hello.
- Hm.

01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:54.369
[soft chuckle]

01:07:57.472 --> 01:07:58.537
[gulps]

01:07:58.539 --> 01:07:59.574
Ah.

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:02.474
- Hi.
- [Elyse] Hi.

01:08:02.476 --> 01:08:03.876
- Ray Warding.
- [Elyse] Sorry to interrupt.

01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:05.077
- Elyse.
- Not at all.

01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:07.447
- Pleasure to meet you, Elyse.
- [Elyse] Nice to meet you.

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:08.514
- Raymond.
- Morning.

01:08:08.516 --> 01:08:09.583
You're here. That's great.

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.684
- [Ray] Indeed, I am.
- [Ivan] You met Elyse, Ray?

01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:13.318
- [Ray] Yeah, we just met.
- Mm.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.155
Yeah. Um, hi, Raymond.

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.656
[Ray] My parole officer
calls me Raymond.

01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:18.258
You please call me Ray.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.626
Ray. You know, I'm...
I'm gonna go get dressed.

01:08:20.627 --> 01:08:24.496
No, no, no. Stay here.
I'm gonna get outta your hair

01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:28.336
because I am on my way to work.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.473
Elyse.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:34.340
[Elyse] Nice to meet you.

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:36.542
- <i>Enchanté.</i>
- [Elyse] All right.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.643
- You good?
- I'm good.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:38.745
- Yeah?
- [Ivan] Yeah.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.179
All right.

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.313
Ciao ciao.

01:08:41.314 --> 01:08:42.350
- Bye.
- [Elyse] Ciao.

01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:48.420
- Sorry.
- [Elyse chuckles softly]

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:50.522
That's my brother.
I thought he'd be gone by now.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:52.959
Hmmm. He's, um,
he's off to work.

01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:54.660
Mm.
[clicks tongue]

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:57.330
Well, probably going to a bar
for the next 11 hours

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:59.464
to bet on horses
and then get shitfaced.

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:00.700
- Huh.
- He's staying with me

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:02.868
for a while until he gets back
on his feet.

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:05.205
What, uh,
what took him off his feet?

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.339
Hmm,

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:08.308
bipolar disorder,

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.742
class three narcotics,
William Gibson novels.

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:12.511
That, and my mother left
when he was six,

01:09:12.514 --> 01:09:14.413
and the old man
died in prison. So...

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.982
Ah, that's rough.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.716
- I get it.
- [Ivan] Yeah.

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:19.551
Family. Yay!

01:09:19.554 --> 01:09:21.321
[Elyse] Hmm.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.790
I, um, I have to feed my cat.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.991
- You got a cat?
- Yup.

01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:28.560
Didn't figure you
for a cat lady.

01:09:28.563 --> 01:09:30.763
Just because I have a cat
doesn't make me a cat lady.

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:32.432
[Ivan] Well, that is true.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.901
- What's it called?
- [Elyse] Cat Stevens.

01:09:34.903 --> 01:09:36.702
You got a cat
called Cat Stevens?

01:09:36.703 --> 01:09:38.504
- [Elyse] Yep.
- [chuckles]

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:39.705
You're gonna have to change
his name.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:42.277
Hm, what,
when it converts to Islam?

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.482
You know, uh,

01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:52.251
I could just take it all back.

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:54.419
I don't think you can put
toothpaste back in the tube.

01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:56.688
You know, I may have said a...

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.523
teensy little bit too much
last night,

01:09:58.525 --> 01:10:00.692
but honestly,

01:10:00.694 --> 01:10:02.564
- this isn't your problem.
- [Elyse] Hmm.

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.735
This wasn't my problem,
and now it is.

01:10:09.337 --> 01:10:10.573
I'm gonna go get dressed.

01:10:14.809 --> 01:10:16.811
[engine revving]

01:10:34.328 --> 01:10:35.797
[door slams]

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.511
[foreboding music]

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.863
[water trickling]

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:25.614
[trickling continues]

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:28.817
[rattles]

01:11:34.655 --> 01:11:36.358
[tapping]

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:40.828
[whirring]

01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:48.570
[whirring continues]

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:57.876
[thuds]

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:58.881
[pants]

01:12:05.619 --> 01:12:06.721
[car trunk slams]

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:10.857
Thank you.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:11.860
Okay.

01:12:13.461 --> 01:12:14.829
[indistinct chatter]

01:12:31.412 --> 01:12:33.612
[flame roars]

01:12:33.614 --> 01:12:37.183
[Ray] <i>Yeah. Hi. This is Ray.
It's his brother. Uh...</i>

01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:40.689
We had an unexpected guest.
Scary-looking guy.

01:12:41.588 --> 01:12:42.858
<i>I got some ideas.</i>

01:12:56.069 --> 01:12:57.872
[buzzing]

01:12:59.039 --> 01:13:00.442
[clatters]

01:13:09.984 --> 01:13:11.687
[thudding]

01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:25.733
[exhales deeply]

01:13:32.873 --> 01:13:35.074
- [Lyman] <i>This is part one?</i>
- [Ivan] <i>Mm-hm. This is part one.</i>

01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:37.009
<i>I've just got to get the phone.</i>

01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:38.577
[Lyman] <i>You're not gonna tell
me part two?</i>

01:13:38.579 --> 01:13:39.782
[Ivan] <i>Nope. Not yet.</i>

01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:43.249
[Lyman] <i>Well, okay. Fuck it.</i>

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:45.183
Now listen. This is your shit.

01:13:45.185 --> 01:13:47.786
I ain't gonna hate Kool-Aid
in there and save your ass.

01:13:47.788 --> 01:13:48.791
I know.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.523
[door handle clatters]

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:53.593
Uh, you gonna let me out?

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:54.794
Oh, this door is broken.

01:13:54.796 --> 01:13:56.062
You gotta work the handle.

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.129
- [clanks]
- Pull it up.

01:13:57.131 --> 01:13:58.563
Up? Pull this thing up here?

01:13:58.565 --> 01:13:59.866
- [Lyman] Mm-hm.
- [handle clanking]

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.032
- [Ivan] All right.
- Work it.

01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:02.570
- [Lyman] There you go.
- [Ivan] Great.

01:14:03.904 --> 01:14:04.939
[door creaks, slams]

01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:09.275
Damn.

01:14:09.277 --> 01:14:11.843
[Lyman] There's some
ol' country-ass shit here.

01:14:11.845 --> 01:14:14.112
He like he tryin' to set up
for an inquisition.

01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:15.514
Mm-hm.

01:14:15.516 --> 01:14:17.983
He's our meal ticket, though.

01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:19.050
[Lyman]
Look, he say he's in there

01:14:19.052 --> 01:14:21.254
tryin' to steal
this guy's phone.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:24.022
Watch his ass.
I don't trust him.

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:25.827
[Lyman] <i>He's a goddamn thief.</i>

01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:32.134
[foreboding music]

01:14:58.693 --> 01:15:00.695
[foreboding music continues]

01:15:23.917 --> 01:15:26.686
[Ivan] <i>All right. You think
you can get him to Laguna?</i>

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:27.920
[Elyse] <i>How do I know who he is?</i>

01:15:27.922 --> 01:15:31.156
[Ivan] <i>Well, he's
the biggest creep in the bar.</i>

01:15:31.158 --> 01:15:34.160
- [Elyse] <i>Don't fuck me on this.</i>
- [Ivan] <i>I won't.</i>

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.298
<i>I promise. I'll be there.</i>

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:40.536
[scoffs]

01:15:42.737 --> 01:15:43.872
- [groans]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:15:44.872 --> 01:15:47.272
[Elyse] Fucking heel is broken.

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:50.009
Excuse my French, but I
just fucking got these shoes,

01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:51.113
and they're broken.

01:15:52.846 --> 01:15:54.179
Who's the manufacturer?

01:15:54.181 --> 01:15:55.315
[soft chuckle]

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.719
You say that like you're gonna
take a hit out on them.

01:15:58.819 --> 01:15:59.820
Possible.

01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:01.789
I believe you.

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:03.990
You, um...

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.761
You think I can
go barefoot in here?

01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:10.097
Well, you look like you could do
pretty much whatever you want.

01:16:13.033 --> 01:16:15.934
Can I, um, see what
red wines you have by the glass?

01:16:15.936 --> 01:16:18.236
You know what, maybe
you'd like to try this one.

01:16:18.238 --> 01:16:20.639
I've got more than
I can handle here.

01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:23.275
You look like you can
handle plenty, but, um,

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:25.777
sure, I'll, uh, I'll try it.
What kind is it?

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.713
It's an Italian red.
I don't really...

01:16:27.715 --> 01:16:29.415
know too much about wines.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:30.915
David, fetch her a glass,
would you please?

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:31.817
[David] Of course.

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:33.385
[Dimitri]
I think you might enjoy it.

01:16:33.387 --> 01:16:35.222
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:16:36.157 --> 01:16:37.822
I'm Karen.

01:16:37.824 --> 01:16:38.926
[Dimitri] Dimitri.

01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:43.728
Anyone ever tell you
you look like a...

01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:46.432
- movie star?
- [chuckles]

01:16:46.434 --> 01:16:50.702
Um, well, my mother used to say
I looked like Audrey Hepburn

01:16:50.704 --> 01:16:53.205
if, um,
Audrey Hepburn was a bitch.

01:16:53.207 --> 01:16:54.773
[both chuckle]

01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:56.909
I think your mom
and my dad would get along.

01:16:56.911 --> 01:16:58.113
[Elyse] Hmm.
[chuckles]

01:16:59.079 --> 01:17:00.082
Mm.

01:17:00.914 --> 01:17:02.748
It's really good.

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:05.217
[Dimitri] From Corsica,
apparently.

01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:07.119
I just order the expensive ones
that he recommends.

01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:08.153
I don't really know too much
about them.

01:17:08.155 --> 01:17:10.690
They all kind of taste like
Robitussin to me.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:11.924
[giggles]

01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:13.159
[Dimitri] It's supposed to be
good for you. I don't know.

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.296
Well, if you say so.

01:17:15.395 --> 01:17:16.764
- What do you do?
- Mm.

01:17:18.699 --> 01:17:20.132
I'm an art consultant.

01:17:20.134 --> 01:17:21.866
What does that mean?
[soft chuckle]

01:17:21.868 --> 01:17:25.204
You know, I... I help people
with their collections. I mean,

01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:28.139
for example, I hook up buyers
with rare pieces.

01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:29.974
Stuff like that.

01:17:29.976 --> 01:17:31.309
How about you? What do you do?

01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:34.813
Well, I am an actress,
um, but...

01:17:34.815 --> 01:17:36.982
please don't ask me
if you've seen me in anything.

01:17:36.984 --> 01:17:38.084
[Dimitri] That's what
everybody asks?

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.285
Oh, yeah. I, um...

01:17:40.287 --> 01:17:44.156
I just tell them I was
in <i>Forrest Gump. It's easier.</i>

01:17:44.158 --> 01:17:45.193
Were you?

01:17:46.127 --> 01:17:50.463
[both laughing]

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:53.869
So, um, you're just eating
at the bar alone?

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.769
- Not anymore.
- Hmm.

01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.271
[Dimitri] What about you?

01:17:59.273 --> 01:18:02.340
Oh, uh, I was going to meet
some producer

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:04.744
about a movie, but he's...

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.211
an hour late, so...

01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:08.147
He wants to put you
in a picture?

01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:11.282
Oh, and I think he wants
to put me in his pants.

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:13.121
- I understand.
- [Elyse] Mm-hm.

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.757
Excuse me just one second.

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:28.436
[door opens]

01:18:31.072 --> 01:18:32.074
[door closes]

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.143
[foreboding music]

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:59.067
[Elyse] No, of course not.
That's fine.

01:19:00.033 --> 01:19:01.168
Yeah, you too.

01:19:02.369 --> 01:19:03.471
Piece of shit.

01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:07.039
[Dimitri] You all right?

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.440
- What happened?
- Well...

01:19:08.442 --> 01:19:09.508
[Dimitri] I mean,
with the producer.

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.876
[scoffs]
He stood me up.

01:19:11.878 --> 01:19:14.412
Such a prick. He sends a car
for me in Laguna Beach,

01:19:14.414 --> 01:19:16.581
- and then he doesn't show.
- [phone rings]

01:19:16.583 --> 01:19:18.487
I'm so sick of this shit.
[chuckles]

01:19:21.322 --> 01:19:23.155
Beautiful.

01:19:23.157 --> 01:19:24.857
What's, um... What's that?

01:19:24.859 --> 01:19:27.226
Nothing. It's, uh, just a deal
that went through.

01:19:27.228 --> 01:19:28.230
[Elyse] Good for you.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.871
Do you wanna go for a ride
in my limousine?

01:19:37.003 --> 01:19:38.269
Yeah.

01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:40.539

01:30:14.774 --> 01:30:16.241
It's really too bad
he's laying dead

01:30:16.243 --> 01:30:19.110
by the side of the road
in Costa Mesa right now.

01:30:19.112 --> 01:30:20.812
- Fuck you.

You see the fucking future.

01:30:24.784 --> 01:30:26.918

- [Elyse] Fuck you.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.189

[Ivan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't move. Don't fucking move.

01:30:41.801 --> 01:30:43.668
[Dimitri] All right.

01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:46.103
I think I understand
what's going on here.

01:30:46.105 --> 01:30:47.339
[Dimitri]
What's supposed to happen.

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.241
You handcuff me to the wall.
You phone in some anonymous tip.

01:30:50.243 --> 01:30:53.611
It's like I was stealing
some artwork, correct?

01:30:53.613 --> 01:30:55.080
Something like that.

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:57.014
That's an Egon Schiele
on the wall, right?

01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:59.150
- Yep.
- [Dimitri] That's a nice piece.

01:30:59.152 --> 01:31:01.052
I take the fall.

01:31:01.054 --> 01:31:02.623
You guys get away clean.

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:05.193

If I were you, I'd put
the weapon down right now.

01:31:48.935 --> 01:31:51.035
In fact, let me give you
a little extra motivation.

01:31:51.037 --> 01:31:52.172

I think we can, uh,

01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:23.768
come to an agreement, all right?
I just, uh...

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:25.704
I just wanted to make one point.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.205
What point?

01:32:27.207 --> 01:32:29.043
Well, there's uh, there's uh...

- You know, it's a thing, right?

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.647
Yeah, there's totally a thing.
There's a thing.

01:32:35.649 --> 01:32:37.616
What do you mean a thing? What,
what are you talking about?

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.285
You know how all wine all tastes
a little bit different, right?

01:32:40.287 --> 01:32:41.686
Yeah, they always
taste different.

01:32:41.688 --> 01:32:43.120
- That's true.
- Yeah.

01:32:43.122 --> 01:32:45.022
I don't understand.
They all taste the same to me.

01:32:45.024 --> 01:32:46.191
What are you talking about?

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:48.058

- [Ray clears throat]
- [Elyse] Yeah, he is.

01:33:33.739 --> 01:33:35.807
He is very dead.

01:33:35.809 --> 01:33:38.677
That was a little closer
than discussed, Ray.
