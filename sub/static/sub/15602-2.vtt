00:05.263 --> 00:06.715
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:08.901 --> 00:10.560
There are Lanterns dying out there!

00:10.616 --> 00:14.317
We need to get out there and stop
who ever is targeting them. Now!

00:18.348 --> 00:21.348
<b>1x02 - Beware My Power, part 2</b>

00:22.349 --> 00:26.884
<i>Hal Jordan of Earth, soon to be
former Green Lantern of sector 2814.</i>

00:27.114 --> 00:29.458
<i>You are now charged with
 treason, grand theft and...</i>

00:29.578 --> 00:32.671
Let's postpone my lynching until
I tell you a couple of things.

00:33.082 --> 00:34.766
You see these handsome devils?

00:34.886 --> 00:39.082
They're the Lantern killers you said didn't exist.
Call themselves Red Lanterns.

00:39.202 --> 00:40.141
Ring any bells?

00:40.403 --> 00:42.755
<i>Red Lanterns, are you sure?</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:46.506
<i>He has concocted this ruse to save himself
from a deserved punishment.</i>

00:46.761 --> 00:50.939
Respectfully, sir. I got an aching jaw
that says they ain't no ruse.

00:51.226 --> 00:53.696
Their Power Rings fire
some sort of red energy tha-

00:53.958 --> 00:56.360
<i>They have rings?!
 Powered by what?</i>

00:56.703 --> 00:59.582
Best guess... a huge desire to
mash us all into pulp.

01:02.669 --> 01:07.371
I say we high tail it back to Oa, cram the
interceptor with as many GLs as she'll hold...

01:07.491 --> 01:10.916
...ultra-warp back and kick their red butts
until they're black and blue!

01:11.178 --> 01:15.002
<i>Despite the colorful terminology,
a logical course of action.</i>

01:16.266 --> 01:19.299
<i>Sensors have picked up an unmanned
probe sweeping the area.</i>

01:19.561 --> 01:22.719
<i>Markings match the insignia of the
recently encountered hostiles.</i>

01:22.981 --> 01:26.712
Right. Red Lanterns.
Aya, plot intercept course. It's go time.

01:26.937 --> 01:29.624
<i>Hal Jordan of Earth,
do not terminate this communication..!</i>

01:29.987 --> 01:32.166
Sorry, gotta take this, 
don't be a stranger.

01:37.522 --> 01:40.554
This threat may turn out to be nothing
more than a few extremists.

01:40.816 --> 01:42.452
If the truth does come out...

01:42.572 --> 01:45.892
...many will wonder why it isn't recorded
in the book of Oa.

01:46.249 --> 01:50.943
Because Sayd, the history is written,
or unwritten, by the victors.

01:54.056 --> 01:56.094
Forget about snaring it, just blast it!

02:00.464 --> 02:02.553
<i>Warning! Shield degrading.</i>

02:08.717 --> 02:10.759
Hal, break off!
Stick to the plan.

02:10.955 --> 02:13.030
We go for reinforcements, then come back!

02:13.136 --> 02:15.746
We can't let this thing give away our position!

02:15.834 --> 02:17.657
What position?!
We're going home!

02:17.850 --> 02:22.065
The Red Lanterns cought you with your pants
down back on that rock and you want payback!

02:25.902 --> 02:29.520
<i>Direct hit to port ampoules.
Shield's degrading to critical.</i>

02:29.680 --> 02:31.943
<i>Please do not let that happen again.</i>

02:32.419 --> 02:34.708
Get ready to fire when I clear that rock.

02:46.422 --> 02:47.684
Peekaboo.

02:52.412 --> 02:53.880
Happy?

02:54.536 --> 02:55.860
That felt good!

02:56.235 --> 03:01.054
A probe tlike that means the Red Lanterns are
more than two killers with rings and a symbol.

03:01.243 --> 03:02.605
They're organized.

03:02.715 --> 03:05.468
Yeah...
Looks like we can't hog all the fun.

03:05.589 --> 03:07.766
Let's hit HQ and load up
the boys like we planned.

03:07.924 --> 03:09.471
Aya, take us home.

03:09.683 --> 03:11.174
<i>Arching ultra-warp drives.</i>

03:11.314 --> 03:15.561
<i>Ready in three... two... one...
Impel.</i>

03:22.972 --> 03:24.891
Are we there yet?

03:25.195 --> 03:26.535
Aya, what happened?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.680
<i>Overload due to hairline crack
in the ultra-warp coil.</i>

03:29.855 --> 03:33.219
<i>Most likely caused by last
missile hit by enemy probe.</i>

03:33.360 --> 03:37.366
For the record, she said most likely...
Not totally likely.

03:37.545 --> 03:40.394
- What does that mean?
- It means we're gonna be a little late to Oa.

03:40.537 --> 03:44.496
That's okay, I like to make an entrance.
Aya, please estimate time for repairs.

03:44.603 --> 03:45.853
<i>Calculating.</i>

03:45.970 --> 03:49.422
- Ultra-warp ready in nine point two...
- Nine minutes, no problem!

03:49.588 --> 03:51.603
<i>Nine point two one months.</i>

03:53.068 --> 03:54.848
Okay...

03:55.047 --> 03:58.157
Can we form a construct and replace
the defective part for the ride home?

03:58.287 --> 04:02.253
<i>The construct would have to be an exact
copy of the ultra-warp coil mechanism.</i>

04:02.427 --> 04:07.273
<i>And it's 56 moving parts to within
a 0.8162 microns tolerance.</i>

04:08.555 --> 04:10.718
Can either of you do that?

04:11.147 --> 04:14.096
- I make hammers.
- Look, maybe it's for the best...

04:14.263 --> 04:16.095
The Guardians won't deal
with the problem like we will.

04:16.228 --> 04:18.274
We'll make those Red Lanterns pay.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.415
Is he all right?

04:23.534 --> 04:25.525
Just... a little light headed...

04:25.609 --> 04:27.175
He's taken a beating.

04:27.282 --> 04:32.069
He needs a real doctor, he's not making
nine hours, never mind nine months!

04:32.184 --> 04:35.079
I was kinda looking forward to seeing Oa.

04:36.582 --> 04:41.089
Aya, scan for the nearest inhabited world.
Preferably one with a hospital.

04:41.174 --> 04:44.470
Don't bother...
I know my own sector anywhere.

04:44.847 --> 04:47.194
We're not far from my home colony.

04:47.385 --> 04:50.873
Sounds like a good place to lay low
for a while and get you fixed up. 

05:13.974 --> 05:18.755
You had three Green Lanterns
in your grasp, and let them escape?!

05:19.265 --> 05:23.168
Perhaps you're not wholly committed
to our righteous crusade.

05:23.288 --> 05:29.561
I live to serve the mighty Atrocitus,
your will is the core of my very being.

05:29.823 --> 05:32.503
What good is that to me Zilius Zox...

05:32.623 --> 05:37.235
... if you're not competent to kill
a mere three Green Lanterns?

05:37.585 --> 05:42.907
It was this child's fault! He's been
promoted too quickly, and on false grounds!

05:43.425 --> 05:47.387
He pitied them!
The destroyers of our system!

05:47.507 --> 05:49.748
What do you have to say for yourself Razer?

05:50.080 --> 05:54.908
Zox lies. But these Lanterns were
different from those we eliminated before.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.172
Tougher... Better trained...

05:57.813 --> 05:59.673
How could they know already?

06:00.416 --> 06:02.964
- Who my lord?
- The Guardians of Oa!

06:03.084 --> 06:08.350
If they've sent reinforcements then
your failure may jeopardize my plans!

06:08.651 --> 06:10.775
No! 
They must be destroyed!

06:10.895 --> 06:14.546
They must die for Shard,
all for you and Shard, master!

06:14.666 --> 06:18.601
That's right Zilius.
Shard is sacred ground.

06:18.721 --> 06:21.431
A piece of the remains of 
our world which

06:21.482 --> 06:25.090
the Guardians attempted to
erase from the universe.

06:26.611 --> 06:29.515
They did not succeed then, 
and will not today!

06:31.393 --> 06:32.215
Look.

06:34.781 --> 06:38.921
It seems one of my hunter killer drones
found the Green Lantens.

06:42.812 --> 06:46.941
Your "hunter killer drone" isn't
much on the killer part, is it?

06:47.061 --> 06:48.992
The done's attack was a feint.

06:49.112 --> 06:53.255
It's actual goal was to plant a tracker
which will lead us to them.

06:54.049 --> 06:58.469
And then we'll draw out these
Guardian lapdogs and destroy them.

06:58.928 --> 07:01.004
Wherever they may hide. 

07:09.029 --> 07:10.405
Don't be such a baby.

07:10.525 --> 07:12.547
Very handy to have a doctor for a wife.

07:13.078 --> 07:16.136
Medicine is something I picked up
because of my husband's second job.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.778
She's actually the colony's head geologist.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.682
I was an engineer, that was how we met.

07:20.802 --> 07:24.698
Beata's the genius who dreamed up
using the volcanoes lava for thermal power.

07:25.071 --> 07:27.551
So was that your secret identity, 
engineer?

07:27.907 --> 07:29.105
Secret what?

07:30.648 --> 07:34.163
That's Hal's hang-up,
that thing on his face, it's a mask.

07:34.283 --> 07:36.531
He wears it in case
some earthling sneaks

07:36.532 --> 07:39.472
into the interceptor,
while in space mind you and goes: 

07:39.583 --> 07:44.033
Aha! The Green Lantern on my
planet is Hal Jordan! I'm telling everyone!

07:47.966 --> 07:52.896
Haha... Talk to me when your planets invents
paparazzi and the 24-hour news cycle.

07:53.427 --> 07:54.247
<i>Daddy!</i>

07:54.768 --> 07:57.661
Wait... Who is this giant?

07:58.069 --> 07:59.967
What have you done with 
my daughter Amala?

08:00.986 --> 08:02.260
I am Amala!

08:03.193 --> 08:06.617
Now, now... Time for hugs later.
Let daddy rest.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.722
Bye daddy!

08:15.251 --> 08:18.947
This is some place...
Kinda reminds me of where I grew up...

08:19.401 --> 08:20.445
Bolovax Vik.

08:21.146 --> 08:24.445
I'm sorry.
Even here we heard about it's destruction.

08:27.384 --> 08:30.410
Your planet was destroyed?
I-I never knew... how did...

08:30.449 --> 08:33.618
Just concentrate on gettin' us out of
this mess you made hotshot.

08:33.738 --> 08:34.546
<i>Attention!</i>

08:34.808 --> 08:37.215
<i>I have found a tracking device
on the interceptor's hull...</i>

08:37.477 --> 08:39.481
<i>... and require assistance removing it.</i>

08:45.840 --> 08:47.191
Do you think they..?

08:48.189 --> 08:50.647
Yeah.
Pretty sure they do.

09:04.199 --> 09:06.094
<i>Whoa!
What is it?</i>

09:10.622 --> 09:15.042
<i>This colony know enjoys the protection
of the Red Lantern Corps.</i>

09:15.390 --> 09:18.298
<i>You have been liberated from
the tyranny of the Guardians.</i>

09:18.560 --> 09:20.967
<i>But their Green Lantern
 lackeys are here...</i>

09:21.281 --> 09:25.670
<i>You have one solar hour to
bring these war criminals to us...</i>

09:25.984 --> 09:28.830
<i>... or your planet will be vaporized.</i>

09:37.148 --> 09:38.651
Those murdering red...

09:38.771 --> 09:40.528
We have to turn ourselves over to them.

09:40.790 --> 09:41.759
Shyir, no!

09:41.879 --> 09:44.885
- We don't have a choice!
- These guys are murderers.

09:45.005 --> 09:47.285
They're gonna blow up this rock
no matter what you do!

09:47.547 --> 09:48.938
We do have a choice.

09:49.058 --> 09:52.791
We can fight them. And keep fighting,
until we can't fight anymore.

09:53.411 --> 09:56.723
That thing is a fortress.
A frontal attack would be suicide.

09:56.843 --> 09:58.770
Hey, if you've got
another way, I'm all ears,

09:58.771 --> 10:00.698
but we've got to take that thing out!

10:00.818 --> 10:03.111
The Earth-Man is right, we must go!

10:10.790 --> 10:11.860
Shyir, wait!

10:13.990 --> 10:15.388
I have another way! 

10:21.692 --> 10:24.739
Time's up! Shall I initiate
the countdown to detonation?

10:25.048 --> 10:27.418
No. Razer will do it.

10:29.245 --> 10:33.832
Atrocitus, our cause is right and just...
But, to kill innocents...

10:34.197 --> 10:38.159
As I told you master, he's weak!
Weak...

10:38.279 --> 10:42.465
The Guardians and their lapdogs
destroyed my homeworld.

10:42.801 --> 10:45.960
And Zilius's.
 And countless others.

10:46.314 --> 10:51.474
By making an example of these disloyal few,
we save millions later.

10:51.736 --> 10:56.331
Show weakness now and
you doom our people forever.

10:56.825 --> 11:00.272
I am not weak.
I am not a coward.

11:01.351 --> 11:04.487
For the greater good.
And vengence!

11:04.986 --> 11:07.323
<i>Countdown sequence initiated.</i>

11:07.585 --> 11:11.077
<i>You have five minutes to get
to minimum safe orbital distance.</i>

11:13.654 --> 11:14.737
Knock, knock!

11:15.802 --> 11:17.055
Anybody home?!

11:17.998 --> 11:19.107
Zox, come!

11:22.546 --> 11:25.056
Razer, stay and guard the device.

11:25.176 --> 11:27.375
If attacked, do your duty.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.521
Soon your ring will be
all that's left of you Lantern!

11:40.285 --> 11:42.127
Settle down, demented beach ball.

11:52.358 --> 11:57.504
I am Atrocitus.
Lord and master of the Red Lantern Corps.

11:57.624 --> 12:01.961
I am the one who will destroy
the Guardians and all they stand for.

12:02.223 --> 12:06.467
I am wrath!
I am hate!

12:06.952 --> 12:09.344
I am righteous vengeance!

12:16.773 --> 12:19.938
According to Beata's map,
we're right under it.

12:20.264 --> 12:23.274
Boy, I hope she is right about this.
I'm bakin' here!

12:23.536 --> 12:24.940
She's always right.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.412
This way!

12:35.463 --> 12:38.826
That must be the controlpanel.
You think you can disarm it Rev?

12:39.803 --> 12:41.463
I'll need a few minute-...

12:55.763 --> 12:57.279
Die, die, die!

13:15.129 --> 13:16.283
Hurry up, Rev!

13:19.455 --> 13:20.856
This guy's not playing around!

13:21.177 --> 13:23.664
Keep him back,
for just a couple of minutes.

13:24.127 --> 13:25.461
This is your fault!

13:25.726 --> 13:29.382
You Green Lanterns might
enjoy destroying worlds. But I do not!

13:33.233 --> 13:35.590
I case you haven't been
keeping up on current events...

13:35.710 --> 13:38.349
... you guys put this thing here,
and pressed the button!

13:38.652 --> 13:40.518
You wanna help!? 
Stop fighting us!

13:40.780 --> 13:44.550
I won't listen to your lies.
I'll destroy you both!

13:47.140 --> 13:50.465
And what, you gonna mass murder
them by blowing up the planet!?

13:51.510 --> 13:55.359
You know what you're fighting againts, kid.
But what are you fighting for?! 

14:09.090 --> 14:10.089
Dumb kid...

14:10.383 --> 14:12.592
Where are Shyir?
Lets have some good news!

14:12.867 --> 14:15.542
<i>Detonation in thirty seconds.</i>

14:25.942 --> 14:27.828
This is disappointing.

14:28.286 --> 14:32.974
If you're the best the Guardians have,
my victory is assured!

14:40.135 --> 14:42.847
Master, the bomb is active.
We need to move away.

14:53.703 --> 14:54.556
<i>Three...</i>

14:54.849 --> 14:55.569
<i>Two...</i>

14:55.894 --> 14:56.595
<i>One.</i>

14:58.685 --> 15:00.596
<i>Detonate. Detonate.</i>

15:02.163 --> 15:03.245
Time to go.

15:03.365 --> 15:07.254
I can keep the laser from igniting
the plutonium, for a little while anyway.

15:08.134 --> 15:10.185
I know what happened to Bolovax Vik.

15:10.465 --> 15:14.433
If you had a chance to save your world...
What would you do?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.353
It's been an honor.

15:34.692 --> 15:38.004
It's foolish to stay when there's
no hope, Green Lantern.

15:38.513 --> 15:42.717
Yeah... we're dumb that way.
But there's always hope.

15:43.395 --> 15:47.984
I know you're not all bad.
Maybe it's time you let others know too.

15:50.444 --> 15:54.546
Best get going, son.
I can handle this last part myself.

16:27.483 --> 16:29.913
It appears you were wrong about Razer.

16:30.175 --> 16:32.832
Never have I been so happy to be wrong.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.812
I'll have the choir scream his
praises at the Rage ceremony.

16:36.932 --> 16:40.140
Now that we've eliminated
the Lanterns from Oa...

16:40.260 --> 16:43.975
soon this galaxy will be ours 
for the taking.

16:44.095 --> 16:47.849
And then the Guardians will pay
for what they've done!

17:04.406 --> 17:06.713
Kilowog? Rev?

17:12.755 --> 17:14.692
They aren't here anymore.

17:23.093 --> 17:26.545
Is that the best you can do?!
You think that will stop me?!

17:48.765 --> 17:51.661
You won't will unless you can
do what is necessary.

17:51.923 --> 17:54.051
Can you do it?
Can you?!

17:59.189 --> 18:00.295
Finish it.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.488
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

18:10.984 --> 18:13.012
But you're not getting of that easy.

18:13.132 --> 18:15.777
You'll live with the consequences
of what you've done.

18:15.897 --> 18:17.753
No! You must kill me!

18:18.074 --> 18:20.772
I'm the one responsible for all
this death and destruction.

18:20.892 --> 18:21.983
I deserve it!

18:22.280 --> 18:24.903
Which is why you're going
to help make up for it.

18:28.839 --> 18:32.572
Coward... 
Are you too weak to take your vengance?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.272
Don't... push it...

18:47.572 --> 18:50.184
- You ganna help me with this, hotshot?
- Kilowog!

18:50.607 --> 18:54.618
I got most of the colonists up before
the big bang, but my ring is running low.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.726
<i>I believe I can help.</i>

19:08.240 --> 19:10.954
What's he doing inside that bubble?

19:11.252 --> 19:15.662
Never mind him.
You are a sight for sore eyes. You too, Aya.

19:16.294 --> 19:18.103
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:18.104 --> 19:20.912
What about Rev. 
Did he make it?

19:32.066 --> 19:34.919
I hope everyone knows the sacrifice 
Shyir made.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.851
They do. The elders are going
to name our new planet after him.

19:43.826 --> 19:47.360
Your daddy was very brave, Amala.
He saved us all.

19:48.303 --> 19:51.004
Is it okay if I still miss him?

19:51.679 --> 19:53.666
Yeah. We all will.

19:59.217 --> 20:02.412
You know, 
Shyir really did save them all.

20:03.416 --> 20:07.531
He asked me what i'd do if I had
another chance of saving my own planet.

20:08.623 --> 20:12.468
And thats when it hit me, 
I'd save the people.

20:13.099 --> 20:15.074
At least one of us got it right.

20:35.473 --> 20:38.995
<i>Cooling system now functional.
Continuing repairs.</i>

20:39.578 --> 20:41.331
So, what's next?

20:41.731 --> 20:43.935
Next, we find the Red Lanterns.

20:44.923 --> 20:47.138
Just how are we gonna stop who knows

20:47.139 --> 20:51.213
how many super poweredful
Red Lanterns with just the two of us?

20:51.582 --> 20:53.583
That's a really good question, Kilowog.

20:53.913 --> 20:57.250
Here's another one, what should
we do with the one we captured?
