<i>Seriously?</i>

<i>We're not gonna get
through this.</i>

04:53.685 --> 04:58.321
<i>Narrator: And seek shelter
from the storm at a DOT camp.</i>

04:58.323 --> 05:03.059
<i>- Now, as cleanup crews roll out...
- Well, I'm gonna drop out</i>

05:03.061 --> 05:03.759

05:03.761 --> 05:05.294
<i>He just went by.</i>

05:05.296 --> 05:08.597
<i>Narrator: Darrell's plan is to
follow the plow, and be one</i>

05:08.599 --> 05:12.668
<i>of the first back on the road.</i>

05:12.670 --> 05:13.869
<i>And I'll tell you what, man,</i>

05:13.871 --> 05:15.271
<i>that plow's going through here,</i>

and shut again.</i>

<i>Narrator: But with the snow still
coming down,</i>

05:23.848 --> 05:28.951
<i>there is no guarantee he'll
make it through.</i>

05:28.953 --> 05:31.554
<i>Man, it's not taking it long,
but it's drifting right back</i>

<i>again.</i>

05:35.593 --> 05:37.960
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

<i>Dig it out though, and dig the</i>

they can come pull it out.</i>

dropped off the side here and</i>

<i>We're just trying to get it
clean around the hood here,</i>

06:23.107 --> 06:23.973
<i>and then we're gonna pull it up</i>

06:23.975 --> 06:29.245
<i>on the road and hopefully get
it started and drive it away.</i>

06:29.247 --> 06:31.347
<i>Right here.</i>

<i>I'm stuck here.</i>

<i>Narrator: And ended up in the
ditch, blocking the road and</i>

<i>trapping the drivers behind him.</i>

<i>I'm the youngest one up here.</i>

waiting to get through.</i>

[Clang]

09:44.524 --> 09:47.959
and reopen the road.

09:47.993 --> 09:50.895
Turn your wheels to the left.

09:50.897 --> 09:53.898
There you go.

09:57.736 --> 10:00.671
Move. Move!

Come on!

Looks like we're
finally pulling out.

Narrator: - After a night stuck in
the snow... - Hey, I appreciate it.

10:32.071 --> 10:37.575

Narrator: But still 130
miles from Prudhoe Bay.

2,400 miles to the southeast...
Polar Industries is in trouble.

10:49.889 --> 10:53.324
We've had some challenges and struggles
on the first couple runs here.

10:53.358 --> 10:55.827
And we've got to iron out these
kings and hope the second half

10:55.829 --> 10:58.696
of the season goes a lot smoother
than this first half has.

10:58.698 --> 11:02.533
Narrator: - This season... - Been so
rough that the truck pops out of gear.

11:02.535 --> 11:07.271
Narrator: Warm temperatures are
wreaking havoc on the winter roads...

Yeah, she's cracking up
big-time under me here.

Narrator: - Making deliveries...
- You gotta be joking.

11:14.681 --> 11:17.181
Narrator: Nearly impossible.

Well, hopefully, they're
in the right spot.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.988
Narrator: And with only two
loads on the books...

11:23.990 --> 11:28.759
Hugh's stake in the company's
profits isn't looking good.

11:28.827 --> 11:29.994
I committed myself.

11:29.996 --> 11:33.498
We shook hands on the deal, and
regardless, if you're gonna

11:33.500 --> 11:35.733
be in business, you've
got to be prepared.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.635
I mean, you take the
good with the bad.

11:37.637 --> 11:41.539
Narrator: Today, desperate to
move high-paying loads, Hugh and

11:41.541 --> 11:45.076
Rick are taking on their
toughest challenge yet.

11:45.078 --> 11:48.079
First big load.

11:48.081 --> 11:51.916
Hauling full-size cement trucks
all the way to Red Sucker Lake.

11:51.918 --> 11:53.818
We got some cement trucks, and
we're gonna bring 'em down

11:53.820 --> 11:55.086
into Red Sucker Lake, here.

11:55.088 --> 11:57.822
It's gonna be tricky getting these
cement trucks into Red Sucker Lake.

11:57.824 --> 12:03.027
I'm not sure what some of the
weight restrictions are quite yet.

12:03.029 --> 12:06.831
Narrator: Used in construction of homes
and community buildings, cement

12:06.833 --> 12:10.568
trucks are vital to the
survival of the village.

12:10.570 --> 12:11.836
Heaviest load of the year.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.538
Hope we don't go through
the fucking ice.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.374
[Turns engine off]

12:16.376 --> 12:22.113
Narrator: At over 20 tons apiece...
no other drivers have dared

12:22.115 --> 12:26.851
to haul these them across the
melting roads and thin ice.

12:26.853 --> 12:31.355
These dadgum mix drum trucks
are really top heavy.

12:31.357 --> 12:34.225
Narrator: But with the buyer
paying top-dollar to anyone

12:34.227 --> 12:37.495
- that'll take on the challenge...
- That's a rough road in there,

12:37.497 --> 12:40.598
so they'll get thrown in the
opposite way we're driving, it--

12:40.600 --> 12:41.999
We could be in a mess.

12:42.001 --> 12:42.934
[Grunts]

12:42.936 --> 12:45.202
Narrator: It's now or never.

12:45.204 --> 12:46.771
Let's go.

12:46.773 --> 12:47.471
Good to go. Kill it.

12:47.473 --> 12:50.474
Right on, man.

12:52.744 --> 12:54.679
[Laughs]

12:54.681 --> 12:55.947
Fuck, where's my cowboy hat?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.816
Holy fuck.

12:58.850 --> 13:02.086
We start falling into holes and
stuff, when we get rocking

13:02.088 --> 13:06.724
and rolling, why, it'll
just tip the trailer over.

13:09.361 --> 13:10.461
Oh, my fucking God.

13:10.463 --> 13:11.495
Oh, God!

13:11.497 --> 13:12.630
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:12.664 --> 13:15.499
Narrator: Under the weight of
the cement trucks, the soft

13:15.501 --> 13:18.402
winter roads are
nearly impassable.

13:18.404 --> 13:20.471
Oh, oh, fuck.

13:20.473 --> 13:23.474
Could be rough.

13:28.013 --> 13:30.281
Fuck, that hurt.

13:30.283 --> 13:34.652
Narrator: And the ice...
is still ahead.

13:34.654 --> 13:35.920
Takes a certain breed.

13:35.922 --> 13:39.657
This shit ain't for everybody.

13:43.829 --> 13:49.900
Narrator: - 1,400 miles to the northwest...
- Looking forward to my trip here.

13:49.902 --> 13:52.770
Looks like we're gonna be driving
in the snow a little bit.

13:52.804 --> 13:55.673
Narrator: Alex Debogorski is
on a mission to resupply the

13:55.675 --> 13:59.110
remote communities
of Northern Canada.

13:59.112 --> 14:01.045
Okay.

14:01.047 --> 14:05.883
Narrator: And to keep supplies flowing...
he's heading south to Dawson

14:05.885 --> 14:11.989
City to pick up another load
and bring it back to Inuvik.

14:12.024 --> 14:14.191
Tire check.

14:14.226 --> 14:17.194
Narrator: But the storm that
raged on the Dalton is headed

14:17.196 --> 14:21.899
east, directly into Alex's path.

14:21.901 --> 14:24.201
Visibility might
be questionable.

14:24.203 --> 14:25.102
It's a gray day.

14:25.104 --> 14:27.738
I expect there's gonna
be a bit of a white out.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.074
Hopefully the plows are
out cleaning the road.

14:30.076 --> 14:33.411
Narrator: It's a race against the
clock to make the 1,000-mile

14:33.413 --> 14:37.748
round-trip before the storm
shuts down the Dempster.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.817
Okay.

14:39.851 --> 14:40.551
[Squeak]

14:40.553 --> 14:42.086
That didn't feel good.

14:42.088 --> 14:44.922
[Squeak]

14:44.924 --> 14:46.257
Oh, I got some froze up wheels.

14:46.259 --> 14:48.192
That's what's happened.

14:48.226 --> 14:51.462
[Ice creaking]

14:51.464 --> 14:56.267
Narrator: But the sub-zero temperatures
are already slowing him down.

14:56.269 --> 14:58.335
We'll stick 'em with a hammer.

14:58.337 --> 15:06.844
We'll roll around on the ground, get
covered with snow... and beat on 'em.

15:12.317 --> 15:16.253
This is one good way
to get run over.

15:22.127 --> 15:25.463
If I hit the drum, it vibrates
the drum and releases the ice

15:25.465 --> 15:29.366
holding the brake
pad to the drum.

15:33.939 --> 15:35.372
There.

15:35.374 --> 15:38.375
Okay.

15:51.389 --> 15:54.492
Okay, those are all good.

15:54.526 --> 15:58.195
Narrator: Alex's
brakes are free.

15:58.197 --> 16:00.831
And we're off and running.

16:00.833 --> 16:04.401
Narrator: But with every lost
second, the veteran's chances

16:04.403 --> 16:09.073
of making it to Dawson City
and back are getting slimmer.

16:09.075 --> 16:12.076
I'm sure the day's gonna
throw a handful of other

16:12.078 --> 16:14.612
interesting things at
me as we go along.

16:14.614 --> 16:18.616
[Truck horn blows]

16:18.618 --> 16:25.556
Narrator: - 450 miles to the west...
- I'm tired of all these

16:25.558 --> 16:27.525
obstructions coming
into our way.

16:27.527 --> 16:32.163
I just want to get to Prudhoe and
hope the next trip's better.

16:32.165 --> 16:37.768
Narrator: Austin Wheeler is rolling north...
as DOT clears the last

16:37.770 --> 16:39.537
stretch of blocked road.

16:39.539 --> 16:42.907
[Truck horn tooting]

16:42.909 --> 16:47.044
- And in the southbound lane...
- What a fucking mess!

16:47.078 --> 16:48.245
Don't sleep in the road!

16:48.247 --> 16:49.747
[Laughs]

16:49.781 --> 16:54.652
Narrator: Word of Austin's night in
the ditch has reached Darrell Ward.

16:54.686 --> 16:56.253
[Laughs] It's Austin.

16:56.255 --> 16:57.521
Austin went by here.

16:57.523 --> 17:00.191
Just got pulled out of a ditch!

17:00.225 --> 17:02.092
Headed up to the top.

17:02.094 --> 17:04.627
Tire chains flopping.

17:04.630 --> 17:07.698
I don't want to be that guy.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.800
Narrator: - So far...
- Right on.

17:09.801 --> 17:11.635
Back on the road again.

17:11.637 --> 17:16.040
Narrator: Darrell's plan to stay
ahead of the pack is working.

17:16.041 --> 17:19.076
DOT's doing a good job of
getting this road cleared out.

17:19.078 --> 17:22.146
Narrator: And the Montana
log-hauler's already left the

17:22.147 --> 17:25.348
worst of the storm behind.

17:25.351 --> 17:31.455
We'll get on through this
hopefully sooner than later.

17:31.457 --> 17:33.757
Narrator: But as he
clears the shelf...

17:33.792 --> 17:36.694
The ambulance is on the way.

17:36.696 --> 17:40.197
Ambulance is on the way?

17:40.199 --> 17:42.399
What's that all about?

17:42.434 --> 17:45.870
[Siren]

17:45.872 --> 17:50.574
Narrator: The devastation
is far from over.

17:54.312 --> 17:59.216
Looks like we got an accident.

17:59.218 --> 18:02.052
Oh, shit, it's nasty.

18:07.459 --> 18:12.763
Narrator: - 60 miles to the south...
- Maybe somebody's on the radio.

18:12.765 --> 18:15.332
We'll see if there's...
any of that weather up north

18:15.334 --> 18:17.601
straightened up or not.

18:17.636 --> 18:18.936
See what happens here.

18:18.938 --> 18:23.574
Narrator: - After spending the night
in Coldfoot... - Anybody up out there?

18:23.576 --> 18:26.176
And know what the
weather's doing up north?

18:26.178 --> 18:27.278
[Tap on windshield]

18:27.280 --> 18:29.546
What the hell's going on here?

18:29.548 --> 18:34.485

Jessee gets a rude awakening.

18:34.519 --> 18:37.321
Hey, Brandon, what's happening?
[Sighs]

18:37.323 --> 18:40.557
One of our pilot cars
got in a wreck on 205.

18:40.592 --> 18:42.059
A wreck-- What?

18:42.061 --> 18:46.130
Yeah. Real bad wreck.

18:46.132 --> 18:49.133
Aw, shit.

18:53.972 --> 18:56.840
All right, let me get my jacket
on, we'll go inside, wake up,

18:56.842 --> 18:58.142
and make phone calls.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.144
All right.

19:10.822 --> 19:13.590
We haven't heard anything.

19:13.592 --> 19:16.026
We're waiting to find any
south-bounders that can tell us

19:16.028 --> 19:18.762
any more information.

19:18.764 --> 19:22.766
Pilot truck versus a big rig.

19:22.768 --> 19:26.937
A great possibility that I
just lost my best friend.

19:31.409 --> 19:35.312
Oh, damn it.

This hurts.

- Oh, shit, it's nasty.

19:59.126 --> 20:04.596
Narrator: Darrell Ward's face-to-face
with a trucker's nightmare.

20:04.598 --> 20:06.765
See if I can help out.

20:06.799 --> 20:12.237
Narrator: On the slick road, the
4,000-pound pilot car spun

20:12.239 --> 20:18.476
out and collided with an
oncoming 16-ton big rig.

20:18.478 --> 20:24.616
The driver's already been taken to
a medevac location by paramedics.

20:24.618 --> 20:28.086
That's the closest to head-on
as you ever want to get.

20:28.088 --> 20:31.022
Narrator: But the
destruction remains.

20:31.024 --> 20:32.924
Just wiped out this
whole side here.

20:32.926 --> 20:34.926
The other side's
barely even touched.

20:34.928 --> 20:40.698
Yeah.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.636
Narrator: - At Coldfoot...
- I do not know who's on-scene.

20:44.638 --> 20:48.540
But if you can,
that'd be great.

20:48.542 --> 20:53.878
- Yeah. So... - Everyone is
scrambling to get word on the

All right, bye.

21:00.454 --> 21:03.455
So EMT security showed up.

21:03.457 --> 21:09.928
He was unconscious, in shock,
suspected neck injury.

21:09.962 --> 21:11.529
They had to get him
out to get him warm.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.698
This-- this is not the place
you just leave somebody in

21:13.700 --> 21:14.999
the vehicle and wait.

21:15.034 --> 21:17.102
Supposedly he had
his seatbelt on.

21:17.104 --> 21:19.003
Probably what did save his life.

21:19.005 --> 21:22.373
Let's go ahead and throw this
tire up on that trailer.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.808
Ready?

21:23.810 --> 21:27.145
Narrator: On the remote road,
there's no equipment to deal

21:27.147 --> 21:31.216
with the scattered wreck,
so Darrell takes the lead.

21:31.218 --> 21:34.119
Yeah, I'm gonna go hook up to
that pickup and drag that pickup

21:34.121 --> 21:37.989
out of the ditch and
down to the pull out.

21:37.991 --> 21:39.991
That'll work.

21:39.993 --> 21:41.526
What it is, is what it is.

21:41.528 --> 21:45.430
This is the kind of shit
that happens out here.

We know everybody up here.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.480
Everybody knows everybody.

You know, in all reality, I
mean, we're a big family.

22:07.554 --> 22:09.921
I think everybody reacts up
here just like it's their own

your people up here.

our mind, this stuff can happen.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.766
We're always safe about it.

But when things go good for a
long enough time, you get

22:24.104 --> 22:29.073
a little lax on it, and it just
doesn't really set in until...

You know, till it happens.

can get, so... they'll be into it.

24:49.349 --> 24:53.217
cement mixers to the remote
village of Red Sucker Lake.

24:53.252 --> 24:54.919
Thing's now top-heavy.

24:54.921 --> 24:59.424
These fucking cement mixers are flopping
around like an old rag doll here.

24:59.426 --> 25:01.225
Whoops! Fuck.

25:01.227 --> 25:02.493
It's fucking bumpy.

25:02.528 --> 25:05.396
Narrator: So far they've done what no
one else dared-- Hauling the

25:05.398 --> 25:09.300
heavy trucks a hundred miles
up the melting winter roads.

25:09.302 --> 25:11.769
Fucking road, she's
pretty rough.

25:11.771 --> 25:17.308
She's slicker than snot
on a chicken's lip too.

25:17.310 --> 25:21.212
Narrator: But now,
they're hitting the ice.

25:21.214 --> 25:27.318
Here's, uh, the ice
road sign here.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.953
It's really, really thin ice.

25:28.955 --> 25:34.125
- So you gotta come down on this
real slow. - All season, Hugh

25:34.127 --> 25:37.929
and Rick have faced the
warm winter's thin ice.

25:37.931 --> 25:44.102
But today... they're crossing with a load
ten times heavier than anything else

25:44.104 --> 25:47.672
they've hauled.

25:47.674 --> 25:51.576
Maximum weight
here is 37.5 tons.

25:51.578 --> 25:57.949
So we are right pushing
the edge right now.

25:57.951 --> 26:01.652
Narrator: With so much weight
focused in a single spot,

26:01.654 --> 26:06.524
if the ice gives way, the
truck will sink immediately,

26:06.526 --> 26:08.993
leaving no chance of escape.

26:08.995 --> 26:11.129
It's really, really thin ice.

26:11.131 --> 26:15.266
So you got to come down
on this really slow.

26:15.268 --> 26:18.403
[Ice crackles]

26:18.405 --> 26:24.642
Oh, yeah, she's just
popping and cracking.

26:24.644 --> 26:27.645
[Ice creaking]

26:42.561 --> 26:44.162
[Laughs]

26:44.164 --> 26:46.798
Fucking unreal.

26:46.800 --> 26:52.603
Yeah, we're moving
the cracks here now.

26:52.605 --> 26:55.440
She's just fucking popping out.

27:14.693 --> 27:17.328
That was pretty serious.

27:17.330 --> 27:20.164
Narrator: The Polar
Bear makes it across.

27:20.166 --> 27:22.266
By the skin of my fucking

27:22.268 --> 27:24.769
ass again, I made it.

27:24.771 --> 27:29.240
Narrator: And now, after one cement
truck has ravaged the ice...

27:29.242 --> 27:32.510
She is not very
thick, so be cool.

27:32.512 --> 27:34.078
Narrator: It's Rick's turn.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.081
[Exhales]

27:41.587 --> 27:44.522
[Ice crackling]

27:50.762 --> 27:52.897
So when you're bringing your
weight on, if you don't slow

27:52.899 --> 27:54.899
down, you'll blow the ice
out right in front of you.

27:54.901 --> 27:58.836
[Ice creaking]

27:58.838 --> 28:04.642
You're hearing ice cracking and shit...
That's usually when the shit

28:04.644 --> 28:10.248
is about to go really wrong, and it's
your last day behind the shifter.

28:10.250 --> 28:11.916
[Water splashes]

28:19.231 --> 28:23.367
Narrator: In the middle of a frozen
Manitoba lake... [ice crackles]

28:23.369 --> 28:27.838
When you're hearing ice
cracking and shit...

28:27.840 --> 28:28.739
That's usually when the shit

28:28.741 --> 28:30.441
is about to go really wrong.

28:30.443 --> 28:34.311
[Ice crackles]

28:34.313 --> 28:38.782
Narrator: Rick Yemm is
crawling across thin ice...

28:38.784 --> 28:41.719
with a 20-ton cement truck.

28:47.659 --> 28:52.596
Whoa.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.797
You never know.

28:53.799 --> 28:57.268
Ice is unpredictable.

28:57.270 --> 29:00.271
[Ice creaking]

29:06.111 --> 29:10.014
Narrator: - Finally...
- I made it again, I lived.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.282
[Whistles]

29:11.284 --> 29:14.551
Narrator: Rick joins
Hugh on solid ground.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.955
I like to get the job done
instead of talking about it.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.690
Yeah, sure.

29:19.692 --> 29:27.298
Narrator: But the battle to reach Red
Sucker Lake... is far from over.

29:27.300 --> 29:34.905
- On the Dempster...
- Lots of wind.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.975
It's laying down some snow.

29:37.977 --> 29:42.479
Narrator: - Alex is 120 miles south
of Inuvik... - Snow's coming.

29:42.481 --> 29:46.617
And bracing a gathering storm
as he heads south to pick

29:46.619 --> 29:49.153
up another load for the village.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.723
I've got trouble with
my windshield wipers.

29:52.725 --> 29:56.259
The snow sticks to 'em at this
temperature-- freezes on 'em-- and

29:56.261 --> 29:58.328
doesn't clean the windows.

29:58.330 --> 30:03.266
Just giving me a little harder
time in seeing the road.

30:03.268 --> 30:14.978
Narrator: But up ahead... Alex's mission...
hits a major roadblock.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.457
Bad news.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.528
Yukon side is poor
visibility and high winds.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.463
I guess it's blocked over there?

30:33.465 --> 30:34.464
Yes.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.333
So you're gonna have to head
back to Inuvik, I guess.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.468
So when do you figure
it's gonna be open again?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.269
You don't know?

30:39.271 --> 30:42.272
Maybe a couple of days.

30:44.842 --> 30:47.811
Okay, we're going back.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.451
I'm heading back to Inuvik.

30:57.555 --> 31:00.657
Narrator: With the road
officially closed, Alex has no

31:00.659 --> 31:05.061
choice but to turn back and head
north with his empty trailer.

31:05.063 --> 31:06.963
It frustrates me.

31:06.965 --> 31:12.068
Narrator: And this trip will
end without a delivery.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.772
I'm disappointed...
that they didn't open that gate,

31:15.774 --> 31:19.976
turn their back, and
let us through.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.579
This is nothing compared to those
guys-- When we'd drive in--

31:22.581 --> 31:23.313
On the Dalton.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.049
Nothing, this is nothing!

31:26.051 --> 31:27.617
Just drove it for nothing.

31:27.619 --> 31:32.522
Wore off a bunch of tires, burned
a bunch of fuel... for nothing.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.991
I'm not happy.

31:34.993 --> 31:38.862
Not happy about today.

31:38.864 --> 31:45.035
Narrator: - 450 miles to the west...
- Miserable trip.

31:45.037 --> 31:49.139
Triple stack of trailers is the
roughest thing I've ever drove.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.640
It's killing me!

31:50.642 --> 31:54.744
Narrator: Darrell Ward's nearing
the end of an exhausting trip.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.780
[Truck horn blows]

31:56.782 --> 31:59.483
It's been a two-day trip
when it should have been

31:59.485 --> 32:02.752
a one-day trip, with
the blow up north.

32:02.754 --> 32:08.225
And I'm just ready to get out of
this truck and roll on to Fairbanks.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.661
Narrator: Despite the delays,
the Dalton newcomer's been

32:11.663 --> 32:15.031
fighting to keep his lead
on the other drivers.

32:15.033 --> 32:20.136
Hopefully things are looking up.

32:20.138 --> 32:27.277
Narrator: - But as the lights of the
city appear on the horizon... - Oh, boy.

32:27.279 --> 32:31.214
Narrator: He's called
into the scales.

32:40.825 --> 32:41.491
How's it going?

32:41.493 --> 32:42.225
Not bad.

32:42.227 --> 32:43.093
How are you doing tonight?

32:43.095 --> 32:44.227
Not too bad.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.662
When was your last inspection?

32:45.664 --> 32:47.931
I haven't had one.

32:47.933 --> 32:51.535
Why don't you grab your truck
and trailer registration, your

32:51.537 --> 32:52.836
license, your med card.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.037
Shut the lights off.

32:54.039 --> 32:57.040
Turn the truck off.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.844
Were you wearing your seatbelt
when you pulled up today?

33:00.846 --> 33:01.545
I was.

33:01.547 --> 33:05.315
I just now unhooked
it to get out.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.289
You got flares or
triangles in the vehicle?

33:12.291 --> 33:14.457
Let me dig 'em out from
underneath the sleeper.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.459
I got a bunch of shit in there.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.061
When was the last
time you checked 'em?

33:18.095 --> 33:19.262
It's been a couple weeks ago.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.030
Couple weeks ago?

33:20.032 --> 33:20.764
Yeah.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.667
Okay, you know you're supposed to
check that stuff every day, right?

33:23.669 --> 33:27.203
- Need to find a better way to
secure this, 'cause... - Yeah.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.406
It coming off there like that,
that's not a good deal.

33:29.408 --> 33:34.044
There was an accident up on the road
today and I ended up helping 'em.

33:34.078 --> 33:36.746
- Well, when you get back in the truck...
- Still got the headlights on.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.583
You need to make sure that
everything's secured down.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.285
Just bring in your registration,
and your license, and your

33:42.287 --> 33:43.053
med card with you.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.388
Yep, I 'll do that.

33:45.390 --> 33:49.192
I hate DOT, you know?

33:49.194 --> 33:52.195
This is bullshit.

33:56.867 --> 33:57.667
Darrell Ward.

33:57.669 --> 33:58.668
Is that your name?

33:58.670 --> 33:59.603
Yep.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.605
You're supposed to put
in miles driven today.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.240
- Oh, okay. Well, I didn't--
- They're not in there.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.676
You've got some
violations today.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.312
Failure to pre-trip your
emergency equipment.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.281
Miles not totaled
in your logbook.

34:11.283 --> 34:14.083
And the load securement for that
4x4 that was sitting on the back

34:14.085 --> 34:16.418
of your drawn deck.

34:16.420 --> 34:20.156
This state has a zero tolerance
policy on the load securement

34:20.158 --> 34:23.927
thing, so, um, I'm gonna have to
issue you a $300 ticket for load

34:23.929 --> 34:28.063
securement.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.034
He's a fucker.

34:34.938 --> 34:40.210
[Engine turns over]

34:40.212 --> 34:44.014
Narrator: - After three long days...
- What pisses me off is it took

34:44.016 --> 34:46.916
him, you know, for-fucking-ever.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.753
Narrator: Darrell's hard-earned
lead is in jeopardy

34:49.755 --> 34:52.455
and his wallet's $300 lighter.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.724
I know I have to
pre-trip every day.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.560
But I don't have to look at my
fucking triangles every day,

34:57.562 --> 34:59.529
when I know they're
underneath the fucking bed.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.997
I know they're there.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.165
I put 'em there.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.468
I've never fucking had a problem
with that ever, anywhere.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.238
Fuck you.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.006
My shit is always tucked in.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.075
And that's what pisses me
off more than anything.

35:12.077 --> 35:15.278
If that wreck hadn't have been there,
I wouldn't have got a ticket.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.148
That fucking wreck
cost me 300 bucks.

35:18.150 --> 35:27.457
Narrator: 450 miles to the north...
another driver is also falling behind.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.193
This has been a pretty...
crappy winter.

35:30.195 --> 35:33.329
Narrator: Jack Jessee is
two days into a trip that

35:33.331 --> 35:36.266
normally takes less than one.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.271
Trucks are in a ditch.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.074
Accidents happening.

35:44.076 --> 35:46.276
Most winters aren't this way.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.813
Narrator: - Last night...
- Oh, fuck.

35:49.815 --> 35:53.717
Narrator: A broken wheels and bad
weather held him up in Coldfoot.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.351
[Ratcheting]

35:55.353 --> 36:01.458
Narrator: And now he's limping
to Prudhoe Bay two wheels down.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.260
[Truck horn blows]

36:04.262 --> 36:06.529
If it ain't blowing,
it's snow drifting.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.165
Yeah, there's supposed to
be a big drift right up--

36:09.167 --> 36:14.337
Right up here at the
top of the hill.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.474
Narrator: Blowing snow from
last night's storm is forming

36:17.476 --> 36:28.518
deep drifts in the road...
making the path ahead nearly invisible.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.321
I gotta keep my speed up, because
I don't have the weight

36:31.323 --> 36:32.522
to plow through it.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.626
I need momentum to get
through this one.

36:41.732 --> 36:45.568
It's a fine line you got to
deal with-- Enough speed to get

36:45.570 --> 36:52.342
through it, but not enough speed that
it's gonna take you off the road.

36:52.344 --> 36:56.546
Your wheels rise up, and you're more
or less hydroplaning on the snow.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.082
You can turn your wheel left, right,
and nothing's gonna happen.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.652
And that's how a snowdrift can
actually throw you into the ditch.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.622
Ka-bloomp-- Sucks you right in.

37:10.327 --> 37:13.396
It's blowing it right on the
ground, like the top six inches.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.165
Got all this snow across it.

37:15.167 --> 37:16.800
It's really hard
to see the road.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.235
Snow blowing on it, snow
drift over the top of it.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.971
Not sure where the edge
of the road really is.

37:21.973 --> 37:27.043
Think you're right in the middle of the
road and drive right off the edge.

37:32.550 --> 37:37.887
Narrator: Jack picks up speed
and hits the drifts head-on.

37:45.696 --> 37:50.333
Come on.

37:50.335 --> 37:53.336
Barely even see the road.

37:56.874 --> 37:59.843
Oh, fuck.

38:20.127 --> 38:26.700
Narrator: - Just south of Prudhoe Bay...
- Crap, where the--

38:26.734 --> 38:33.106
Narrator: Jack Jessee is blasting his
way through three-foot snowdrifts.

38:37.945 --> 38:39.746
God.

38:39.748 --> 38:42.582
This is the worst stretch
of road we've had so far.

38:42.584 --> 38:46.119
Narrator: Already handicapped
with a busted trailer...

38:46.121 --> 38:50.790
Getting through is taking
everything the veteran's got left.

38:50.825 --> 38:56.296
When you start getting into the
snowdrifts, they can shut anybody down.

39:06.907 --> 39:07.574
No!

39:07.576 --> 39:09.209
[Soft whir, silence]

39:09.211 --> 39:13.780
Narrator: Bogged down, Jack
gives it all he's got.

39:13.782 --> 39:16.816
[Soft whir, silence]

39:20.454 --> 39:23.456
Whoa!

39:23.458 --> 39:26.459
[Mechanical rattling]

39:33.734 --> 39:35.668
Come on, you can do this.

39:35.670 --> 39:38.138
You can do this.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.641
Narrator: With temperatures
more than 30 below,

39:41.643 --> 39:48.014
this is the last place
Jack wants to be stuck.

39:48.016 --> 39:49.082
There you go.

39:49.084 --> 39:52.085
Get right out of
that snowdrift.

39:57.324 --> 40:01.194
All right, there we go.

40:01.196 --> 40:02.662
Whew!

40:02.664 --> 40:04.397
[Chuckling] Yeah.

40:04.399 --> 40:07.367
Oh, so much for an easy night.

40:14.742 --> 40:22.649
Narrator: After two grueling days,
Jack finally reaches Prudhoe Bay.

40:26.353 --> 40:28.555
[Engine turns off]

40:28.557 --> 40:32.559
Well, let's see how
everything fared back here.

40:32.561 --> 40:35.829
What a heartache you gave me.

40:35.831 --> 40:39.833
I am glad to be done with
you, I tell you that.

40:39.835 --> 40:45.705
Narrator: From decimated tires...
to blinding snowdrifts...

40:45.707 --> 40:50.710
and a near fatal accident...
[Siren]

40:50.712 --> 40:54.147
the veteran's seen it
all on this run.

40:54.149 --> 40:56.683
There we go.

40:56.685 --> 41:00.954
11, 12 years I've been up
here, this has been...

41:00.956 --> 41:04.424
one of my more nightmare
trips, I would say.

41:04.426 --> 41:10.430
You know, I've seen a lot...
been through a lot.

41:10.432 --> 41:13.433
This one's been rough.

41:20.241 --> 41:26.212
Narrator: - Across the yard...
- Lots of things went wrong last night.

41:26.214 --> 41:31.684
It sucked, but...
Well, what do we got here?

41:31.686 --> 41:35.421
Narrator: After a long trip
that included a night in

41:35.423 --> 41:41.761
- the ditch, Austin's reached Prudhoe
Bay - What I thought was gonna

41:41.763 --> 41:45.064
turn into a one-day easy trip
turned into something epic

41:45.066 --> 41:49.302
that I've never experienced.

41:49.304 --> 41:52.305
And it fucking blew.

41:54.508 --> 42:00.847
Narrator: But it's Darrell that
holds onto the lead... for now.

42:06.220 --> 42:11.791
- 1,800 miles to the southeast...
- Is everything still on there?

42:11.793 --> 42:13.860
[Laughs]

42:13.862 --> 42:16.062
Yeah, she's on there.

42:16.096 --> 42:20.400
Narrator: Hugh and Rick are just
20 miles from Red Sucker Lake...

42:20.402 --> 42:22.435
Oh, fuck.

42:22.437 --> 42:25.138
Narrator: With their
massive cement trucks.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.240
15 more "K" of this shit.

42:27.242 --> 42:29.976
What the fuck.

42:29.978 --> 42:32.845
Narrator: All day, they've been
battered by the weight of

42:32.847 --> 42:38.651
their loads on the soft road, struggling
to make it through in one piece.

42:38.653 --> 42:45.224
Well, this is the roughest
road they've got.

42:45.226 --> 42:49.228
Narrator: But driving in the
dark is a whole other challenge.

42:49.230 --> 42:51.864
You can, uh, only see so
far ahead of you at night.

42:51.866 --> 42:54.934
I mean, you can't see around the
curves like you can in the

42:54.936 --> 42:57.837
daytime-- You're gonna see what's
coming up if there's something.

42:57.839 --> 43:03.609
So the element of surprise is a big
fucking hole right in front of you.

43:03.611 --> 43:05.011
Oh-ho-ho.

43:05.013 --> 43:09.749
You can end up in a
ditch awful easy.

43:09.751 --> 43:11.951
That's a rough corner
ain't it, that one?

43:11.953 --> 43:13.586
Holy fuck.

43:13.588 --> 43:16.389
Oh, fuck!

43:16.391 --> 43:17.290
[Clank]

43:17.292 --> 43:21.227
Oh, fuck.

43:21.229 --> 43:26.566
[Muttering]

43:26.568 --> 43:29.202
She's all over the place here.

43:29.204 --> 43:31.371
Ah, I knew that was
gonna be a bad one.

43:31.373 --> 43:35.508
Whoa!

43:35.542 --> 43:38.644
Narrator: Next time on
<i>Ice Road Truckers...</i>

43:38.646 --> 43:41.481
<i>Why can't I just have
an easy season?</i>

43:41.483 --> 43:44.851
<i>Narrator: Roughriders of the
winter roads... [Siren blips]</i>

43:44.853 --> 43:45.852
<i>What the fuck?</i>

43:45.854 --> 43:49.689
<i>Narrator: Are on the
run from the law.</i>

43:49.691 --> 43:51.290
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

43:51.292 --> 43:55.128
<i>Narrator: - The Dalton rookies...
- In the end, I'm gonna be on top.</i>

43:55.130 --> 43:56.129
<i>Narrator: Stake their claim.</i>

43:56.131 --> 43:57.096
<i>[Truck horn blows]</i>

43:57.098 --> 43:57.930
<i>Can I go now?</i>

43:57.932 --> 43:59.599
<i>This is heavy hauling
right here.</i>

43:59.601 --> 44:01.134
<i>Narrator: And when
things go wrong...</i>

44:01.136 --> 44:03.503
<i>Take it easy-- No, no, no!</i>

44:03.505 --> 44:04.537
<i>Look out.</i>

44:04.539 --> 44:05.638
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

44:05.640 --> 44:07.940
<i>Narrator: One driver will
leave it all behind.</i>

44:07.942 --> 44:09.926
<i>I don't know if I can
handle much more.</i>

44:10.194 --> 44:12.469
I'm out of here, man.

44:12.970 --> 44:15.500
