[woman moaning]

00:07.841 --> 00:11.010
[kissing sounds]

00:12.000 --> 00:13.446
Oh Serge!

00:14.381 --> 00:15.815
Oh my goodness.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.486
Hm okay, this could
get a bit tricky.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.492
Hm. I mean, um,
do we have a plan?

00:25.925 --> 00:29.863
Because you're both
quite large guys and ah...

00:30.000 --> 00:32.298
..is there...
[Lauren sighs]

00:32.365 --> 00:33.933
..an order
that we should...

00:36.000 --> 00:37.303
[sighs] I guess we'll
figure it out.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
Oh!

00:42.409 --> 00:44.778
[Lauren moans]

00:48.000 --> 00:49.282
Huh?

00:54.487 --> 00:56.723
[men moaning]

00:58.458 --> 00:59.926
Excuse me?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.133
I'll see myself out.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.735
[louder] I'll see myself out.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.338
[men moan in climax]

01:12.405 --> 01:17.177
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

01:18.000 --> 01:19.612
[upbeat music]

01:24.000 --> 01:25.485
[Ange] No, I don't know
why Peter's here.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.121
But we do have a
Partner meeting tomorrow,

01:30.000 --> 01:30.423
so maybe he'll
tell me then.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.925
Oh Lauren I'll need
you there as well.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.760
No problem.
Yeah what's this--

01:33.827 --> 01:35.161
Peter Cook's here from London.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.095
Peter Cook?

01:36.162 --> 01:37.831
It's her brother who
she doesn't talk to.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.132
I'm the first Cook by the way.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.134
[laughs] Too many cooks!

01:42.000 --> 01:42.302
What does he need?

01:42.368 --> 01:45.738
Oh no, he's just stopping by
on his way back to London.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.440
According to his P.A.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.009
Apparently he's too busy to
tell me that he's coming
himself.

01:50.076 --> 01:50.944
It'll be budget cuts,

01:51.010 --> 01:52.612
I'm telling you heads
are going to roll!

01:54.000 --> 01:54.848
[Ange] So tomorrow, oh he is
such a pain in the bum,

01:54.914 --> 01:55.982
when it comes to finances.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.417
Or a merger.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.686
So, can I get you to prepare

02:00.000 --> 02:01.554
a full report of your
quarterly billings.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.490
Absolutely! Don't worry.
I'll have a chat with Alex--

02:03.556 --> 02:04.757
-[Alex] Huh?
-[Lauren] We'll sort that out.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.459
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.529
Cool! So how was it?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.201
Oh my god! Well I just thought
having a threesome with two
men,

02:15.268 --> 02:16.636
would be more satisfying.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.639
Hmm. Right!
Were you in the middle?

02:19.706 --> 02:20.807
-No.
-Oh god were you at the end.

02:20.874 --> 02:21.674
No.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.043
See that seems like an awful
lot of jobs in that situation.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.312
Not enough jobs in turns out.
I feel quite let down.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.215
Maybe it's the men
that are involved.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.551
-Next time, why don't we-- -No,
there won't be a next time.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.052
I don't want to enable two men

02:33.119 --> 02:34.721
to disappoint me at
the same time again.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.257
They manage that perfectly
well one by one.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.895
[Ange] Oh Lauren, can I grab
you for a minute right now.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.630
I'm just about to
start the report now.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.431
Oh yeah,
it'll only take a minute.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.002
Well I was hoping for a
suggestion from you.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.304
How, how to help me with this.

02:54.000 --> 02:54.274
[Ange] Well I just can't seem
to get an actual date.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.010
What am I doing wrong?

02:57.076 --> 02:58.211
[Alex] Is that Tough Mudder?

03:00.000 --> 03:00.713
[Ange] Yes! Came 75th. Woo!

03:00.780 --> 03:02.115
That's great. Fitness is good.

03:02.181 --> 03:04.183
-[Ange] Yes.
- But that's a bit aggressive.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.418
Oh, I see, I see.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.520
[Lauren] No one you're going
to have sex with needs to know

03:07.587 --> 03:08.855
that you were the
keynote speaker at the

03:08.922 --> 03:10.356
'Deliberations on the
Economics in Family Law'

03:10.423 --> 03:11.958
conference in 2012.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.326
Really?

03:13.393 --> 03:14.694
And use a multiple
choice question

03:14.761 --> 03:16.162
with anyone
you match with

03:16.229 --> 03:17.363
and just copy and
paste it to everyone.

03:18.000 --> 03:18.865
That's a real time-saver.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.534
And I am a very busy woman.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.903
[cuckoo, cuckoo]

03:26.739 --> 03:29.876
Where is the
fucking potato peeler?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.244
Oh Floss, language!

03:31.311 --> 03:34.480
Sorry, where is the
bloody potato peeler?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.615
Well have you looked in here?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.517
Yes! I've looked in there.
It's orange.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.718
Darling just use a knife--

03:38.785 --> 03:40.086
It's not the 18th Century Mum,

03:40.153 --> 03:41.821
and I've got a perfectly good
potato peeler.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.123
I think Lola must have used it
for an experiment or something.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.458
Oh. Hi Roger, Carol.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.193
-Oh Jake.
-Hi Jake.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.261
Woo, woo, woo,
easy with that knife.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.329
[laughs]

03:49.395 --> 03:51.064
Yes, she's peeling potatoes
with a massive knife

03:51.130 --> 03:52.665
because I can't find
the bloody potato peeler.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.033
-Oh the orange one?
-Yeah.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.602
Yeah, I took that the other
day.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.537
Why?

03:57.604 --> 03:59.238
It's just I've been
sorting out stuff

04:00.000 --> 04:01.774
because Nancy and I are
moving in to a new house,

04:01.841 --> 04:03.309
and I realised
it was still here.

04:03.843 --> 04:04.911
You're moving?

04:06.000 --> 04:06.346
Combining incomes? Good idea.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.148
Yeah, it's a huge space Roger.
Honestly.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.151
Great. Well you can take that
awful cuckoo clock in that
case.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.252
But you wanted that.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.520
No, it was a present
from your Mum,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.222
but if you're moving
to a massive house--

04:18.000 --> 04:18.424
All right you two.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.426
Well you can take that
awful vacuum cleaner as well.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.128
That's okay, I got a Dyson.

04:22.996 --> 04:23.796
You, what!

04:24.130 --> 04:25.698
Now, we were going to get a
Dyson but it turns out--

04:25.765 --> 04:28.601
No Dad. Sorry Dad.
You got a Dyson?!

04:28.668 --> 04:29.569
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.205
So I had to use that piece of
shit vacuum cleaner for 5
years,

04:32.271 --> 04:33.906
which you found on
the side of the road--

04:33.973 --> 04:35.375
It was actually a perfectly
good vacuum though.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.577
That a cat had pissed in Jake!

04:37.644 --> 04:40.146
And now you've got
a fucking Dyson.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.149
[Jake] Yeah, it's just really
quiet and efficient.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.084
Yeah! Yeah I know.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.185
Nice to see you guys.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.488
[upbeat music]

04:49.656 --> 04:51.224
[Roger] Right,
that's the last one.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.027
It's like the
contents of my mind.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.262
So when do you
head off tomorrow?

04:56.329 --> 04:59.966
8:15, be there by 3:42,
give or take.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.002
I can't wait to take the girls
to see those penguins.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.304
Oh, look at this one.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.508
Recycle it. I can't keep every
painting they do Mum.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.210
Darling, why are you suddenly
having a clear out anyway--

05:12.000 --> 05:12.378
I just need some space.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.312
[phone bings] Done!

05:13.579 --> 05:15.615
Now we can call you on the
sat phone wherever we are.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.649
That's great Dad.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.052
I think this is called
'conscious uncoupling'.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.887
No I mean, Jake gets to
start afresh, whereas I'm left

05:20.953 --> 05:22.855
with all the shit we've
collected over the years.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.525
Look at this one.
Is it Lola's?

05:25.591 --> 05:26.492
Darling, you have to admit

05:26.559 --> 05:28.561
her use of colour
is really something.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.629
Yeah. Bin it!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.698
Honestly Mum I can't
keep everything.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.400
Jake gets to purge,
I want to purge.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.175
And just finishing off
everyone, if we take a look at
our last...

05:42.675 --> 05:44.444
Flipping nightmare.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.880
He wants to audit
all the high profile cases,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.550
and he's insisting on meeting
all of the Associates.

05:50.616 --> 05:53.219
Personally, I'm telling you
Peter's up to something.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.620
Hmm, maybe he's
just being friendly.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.990
[laughs] Friendly!

06:00.000 --> 06:00.359
No! Not my brother.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.396
[Ange] Sorry, can I just run
something by you quickly?

06:03.463 --> 06:04.430
Yeah.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.798
I got a match.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.633
-Oow.
-I know.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.105
His name's Javier and he owns
his own dry-cleaning business.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.239
Might be useful.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.340
That's what I thought.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.376
So, I sent him a
multiple-choice ice breaker,

06:18.000 --> 06:18.978
just like you told me.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.481
"If you were a dessert -
would you be:

06:21.547 --> 06:23.683
-a) Tiramisu,
-Okay.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.718
-b) Banoffee Pie,
-Hmm.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.354
-or c) Vanilla Ice Cream?"
-Okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.256
Yeah, and he said,

06:30.323 --> 06:33.192
"Banoffee Pie, because I'm
tasty and full of cream..."

06:36.000 --> 06:37.997
I'm just not sure
how to reply to that one.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.000
Yeah. Okay so, um,
Banoffee pie...

06:42.000 --> 06:42.869
[both] Bananas, toffee, cream!

06:42.935 --> 06:44.704
Okay, yep I got it.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.176
[typing sounds] Yes, yeah,
yeah, there you go.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.911
Just got to convert the sale.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.147
Yes, convert the sale.
Thank you.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.414
No worries.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.019
[Peter Cook] Your work has been
very impressive, this is why...

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
[Ange] How soon do they
respond?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.791
Not that soon.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.194
[upbeat music]

07:12.765 --> 07:15.001
-Has he replied?
-Yes!

07:15.067 --> 07:15.968
Has who replied?

07:16.035 --> 07:17.937
She matched with a
successful businessman.

07:18.004 --> 07:18.938
He sent me this.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.840
-Oh!
-[Alex gasps]

07:20.907 --> 07:22.308
Yeah, it's his willy.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.209
Hm-hm.

07:24.000 --> 07:24.811
I'm just not sure
why he sent it.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.445
Yeah, 'big bananas'.

07:26.512 --> 07:29.615
On reflection
I shouldn't have put that.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.217
"I'm a fan of big bananas"!

07:31.284 --> 07:32.084
Banoffee pie--

07:32.151 --> 07:33.019
Well what did you
expect him to say?

07:33.085 --> 07:33.920
I'm sorry.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.221
They're a great
natural energy source.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.889
Big fan of potassium.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.058
It's my first willy picture.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.126
[Lauren] Oh sorry Ange.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.129
No! It's okay actually.
It's quite enlightening.

07:43.196 --> 07:47.233
I haven't seen another willy
in, over a decade so, hello!

07:48.000 --> 07:48.534
[laughs]

07:48.601 --> 07:50.169
Still, it's not
very romantic is it?

07:50.236 --> 07:51.204
-No.
-No.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.873
What are we talking about?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.007
Just Lauren,

07:55.074 --> 07:56.442
how she doesn't exude
romance or relationship vibes.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.377
-No, I don't.
-Yeah.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.645
[Alex] Ange, maybe
apps aren't for you.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.113
I mean they do tend
towards hook-ups.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.648
Which is the point.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.551
Well, I mean, have you thought
about making a connection

08:06.000 --> 08:07.119
in real life?

08:07.553 --> 08:08.821
[snorts] It's a bit awkward.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.958
-No?
-Connection, in real life?

08:12.024 --> 08:13.125
Yeah.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.929
So you mean actually chatting
someone up, like--

08:16.996 --> 08:17.797
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.732
Well I haven't
chatted someone up in,

08:19.799 --> 08:21.834
since before the
internet was invented.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.070
There's no time
like the present.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.404
[Alex exclaims]

08:25.705 --> 08:27.039
-Really?
-Hmm.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.979
What are you doing?
What's happening?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.017
Okay, so do we go to them or do
we wait for them to come to us?

08:38.084 --> 08:38.885
Um...

08:38.951 --> 08:40.720
Or do I just ask
someone for a light?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.491
Well, we're not smoking are we
so that would be a bit weird.

08:45.558 --> 08:46.525
Yes, it would be weird.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.496
No, we just pick our target,
then we assess.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.834
Right. What about him?
The tall guy with the red tie.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.335
[Lauren] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.138
Let's do a bit of
surveillance first okay.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.775
Follow me. Bring your drink.
Just keep cool okay. Be cool.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.478
[low music and chatter]

09:06.000 --> 09:07.179
So he asked me about
ethical trades,

09:07.246 --> 09:09.382
I said, "Well do you
want to make money or not!"

09:09.448 --> 09:11.851
[men laugh]

09:13.286 --> 09:15.321
I don't think he's
very romantic, no.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.224
You're a busy woman Ange. Don't
waste time chatting to tossers.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.725
-No.
-Okay.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.261
Yes, cheers. No tossers.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.966
Just keep looking
until they come over.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.601
It's quite simple.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.205
So he won't think
that I'm desperate?

09:36.000 --> 09:36.409
I'll just keep looking.
Just keep looking.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.184
No, not glaring Ange! More like
half-lidded, sort of sexily.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.219
-Sexily?
-Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.923
-Ahh, yep, yep.
-Yeah.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.124
Like this...

09:52.191 --> 09:53.793
No, don't chew your lip.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.899
Um, you look a bit ill.
Dial it back, dial it back.

10:00.466 --> 10:01.801
[Lauren] Um, here we go,
here we go.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.536
It's working.

10:03.602 --> 10:04.971
-Play it cool.
-Cool.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.406
A couple of lovely cougars.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.176
-Hello.
-Open your eyes Ange.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.046
[man] So, which of you two
want a go on this?

10:14.513 --> 10:15.481
Sorry, what?

10:15.848 --> 10:16.749
Me.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.084
Are you a fairground ride?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.218
I love fairground rides.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.987
I'll be the ride of your
life baby, I swear to God.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.221
You wanna, you wanna
get out of here.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.656
Yes.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.725
-No.
-Yes.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.661
-Yes.
-No! No Ange. No.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.731
-God!
-I don't understand.

10:36.502 --> 10:39.138
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.440
What am I doing?

10:42.008 --> 10:43.843
I'm probably the
oldest woman here.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.078
What have I got
to offer anyone?

10:46.145 --> 10:47.179
Ange!

10:48.000 --> 10:51.150
You are the Managing Partner
of a leading law firm.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.119
-Remember that.
-Yes.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.588
But my hair doesn't
bounce anymore.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.390
Nothing on me bounces anymore.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.526
You should smile more.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.696
Women look better
when they smile.

11:03.896 --> 11:04.897
Pardon?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.966
Let me buy you a few drinks,
cheer you up a bit.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.968
Ah, she's had all
the drinks thanks.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.569
I am fine, thank you though.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.671
Have a nice night,
but thank you.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.839
Can I ask you something?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.909
You really think you're going
to get a better offer?

11:16.976 --> 11:17.676
What?

11:18.244 --> 11:20.346
Well, with all the makeup
you've caked on and those
eyebrows.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.048
-Okay, let's go home.
-My eyebrows?

11:22.114 --> 11:23.049
I'm just saying,

11:24.000 --> 11:24.216
I don't think
you're in a position

11:24.283 --> 11:25.384
to be too picky are you?

11:25.451 --> 11:26.952
Okay.
Who do you think you are?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.254
Hmm?

11:30.000 --> 11:30.189
You've come over here, you've
offered to buy her a drink,

11:30.256 --> 11:31.924
she declined politely
and now what?

11:31.991 --> 11:35.094
You feel entitled to
insult her for rejecting you.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.863
If you want to get to
know someone, be nice.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.765
Because, do you know what?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.203
We, don't, need you.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.914
Can you give me a hand
with my bag please.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.216
Thank you.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.153
Now, we get shots.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.755
-Whoo, yeah.
-Yeah.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.990
[Lauren] Let's see a band.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
[live music playing]

12:09.895 --> 12:11.497
[music playing]

12:13.566 --> 12:16.001
[Lauren] Oh, yeah, this...

12:18.000 --> 12:18.871
..this isn't home.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.673
We're not at home.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.175
-Isn't it?
-No.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.579
I wonder what suburb
do you think we're in?

12:27.446 --> 12:28.514
Um...

12:30.000 --> 12:30.616
Suburb?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.418
-We're here.
-Yeah.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.019
Thank you.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.888
I'm really hungry.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.356
Maybe we can get a kebab.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.892
-Kebab!
-Kebab!

12:39.959 --> 12:41.760
Oww!

12:43.229 --> 12:44.697
Hello!

12:48.000 --> 12:48.067
See ya later.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.313
[Lauren] Got a girlfriend.
All right. Cool.

13:03.749 --> 13:04.950
Oh hi.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.952
-I'm Gregory.
-Hi Gregory.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.821
-Or George.
-Or George.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.823
-It's Gregory or George.
-Hmm.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.359
Gregory George?
Which one? Georgery?

13:13.425 --> 13:17.329
-It depends on the context.
-I feel a bit sick.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.964
-Oh!
-Oh god!

13:20.266 --> 13:22.701
Maybe this will make
me feel a bit better.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.906
-There you go.
-Yeah, that's better.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.641
-[Lauren retches]
-[Gregory exclaims]

13:30.000 --> 13:30.342
Ahhh!

13:30.709 --> 13:31.911
No, I swallowed it,
it's all right.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.814
Oh no, yeah no, it's good.
Must go. Yep.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.551
[Lauren] Okay, no worries.
I'm not in the mood.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.219
[Gregory] Yep.
See you later.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.124
Yeah, I should go home.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.561
[music fades]

13:56.535 --> 13:58.671
[birds chirping]

14:00.472 --> 14:02.908
[Lauren groans]

14:06.512 --> 14:08.047
Oh gosh.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.593
God!
[knocks bottles over]

14:24.000 --> 14:27.166
[uneasy music]

14:42.481 --> 14:47.486
[distorted music]

14:49.722 --> 14:51.357
Where's my fucking bed?

14:58.197 --> 14:59.798
Okay.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.034
Great!

15:06.000 --> 15:07.840
[Lauren groans]

15:09.141 --> 15:11.844
[chicken clucks]

15:18.484 --> 15:20.919
And when I woke up I just
had this crippling loneliness.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.956
Oh! PMT? Hang over anxiety?

15:24.023 --> 15:25.391
But then I realised
I was just hungry.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.593
I can't stop eating.
We're due on.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.361
I can't eat because
I feel awful.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.700
I mean, why did you
let me go out out?

15:36.000 --> 15:36.201
[Helena] You didn't
even ring me.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.202
[bowl clangs on ground]

15:37.269 --> 15:38.404
[Helena] What?

15:40.039 --> 15:41.407
Where's my table?

15:42.000 --> 15:42.541
[Helena] What are you on about?

15:44.176 --> 15:45.377
[Lauren gasps] Oh no.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.446
Lauren what the hell
is going on?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.181
I think I might have
lost your necklace.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.951
Oow!

15:54.000 --> 15:54.219
[Lauren retches]

15:54.286 --> 15:57.156
[Alex] No, no, no, no.
Do not be sick on the Jensen.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.524
-No I'm fine.
-Yes.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.725
It was a false alarm.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.260
-Okay great.
-Yeah.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.494
-Get out.
-Great.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.097
Already pushing it to
get to my netball finals

16:06.000 --> 16:06.398
in time for the
pre-game rituals.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.700
Sounds a bit witchy.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.601
It is, and now I'm
hauling your sorry arse

16:09.668 --> 16:11.203
all the way across town
to collect a necklace

16:12.000 --> 16:12.871
from some dirty
rockstar's house.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.174
Well Helena gave it to me for
my 30th, so I have to find it.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.475
This is why we don't
schtub dirty rockstars.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.644
I didn't schtub anyone, so...

16:18.711 --> 16:20.446
And this is why
we have the Spreadsheet,

16:20.512 --> 16:22.581
so you don't go around picking
up random necklace thieves.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.949
I know! Well you were too busy

16:24.016 --> 16:25.984
chatting up Peter bloody Cook
all night, so...

16:26.051 --> 16:27.286
And what about Ange?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.521
She went home at three in the
morning, so she's all right.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.456
Here we go.

16:30.522 --> 16:31.990
[Alex exclaims]
[Lauren retches]

16:32.057 --> 16:34.660
No. Go in that dead bush.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.895
-[Lauren retches]
-[Alex] Yep.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.664
-Nope, nah. I'm fine.
-Yep.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.432
Yeah I just need some Berocca,
and I'll be all right.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.367
Okay. Is that what's in there?

16:42.000 --> 16:42.301
Yeah.
[bottle explodes]

16:42.368 --> 16:43.235
[Lauren screams]

16:43.302 --> 16:44.269
What are you--

16:44.336 --> 16:46.271
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.075
Do you have a change?
In the boot of your car?

16:50.142 --> 16:51.343
-No!
-For netball?

17:02.321 --> 17:03.722
You guys want a tea or...

17:03.789 --> 17:05.023
Ah, no.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.493
Just, I wonder if you've,
have you seen my necklace?

17:07.559 --> 17:10.629
Oh cool.
Yeah, no, just help yourselves.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.697
Okay thank you.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.031
Okay, let's hurry this up.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.166
Ah!

17:14.233 --> 17:17.503
Ah so, camomile or
lemon grass and ginger?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.405
Ah, no time for tea thanks.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.873
Is this how you get scabies?

17:20.939 --> 17:22.875
-Yes I think it probably is.
-Oh.

17:25.844 --> 17:26.712
Ah I wouldn't look under there.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.148
-Oh god.
-Jesus.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.585
It's gold. Like with a half
moon and a little curl.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.454
Oh yeah, I was looking for
that.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.589
Yeah, no. Are you sure you
were wearing it last night?

17:37.656 --> 17:39.391
Yes I was, yeah.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.860
Can I give you my number
in case you find it please?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.830
Ah, in case I find it,
yeah okay.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.131
-Thanks.
-There's no password.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.332
Okay, yep.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.202
Just ring me if you find it.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.504
It's really precious.
Thank you.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.973
[Gregory] You're welcome.
And hey, thank you.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.810
[upbeat music]

18:00.813 --> 18:03.081
I didn't realise
that you played netball.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.884
Ah yeah, I started again
after the split.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.053
Keep the serotonin flowing.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.157
You don't strike me immediately
as a netball player.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.526
-Oi!
-Well, yeah.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.595
I was captain of
my university team.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.963
-Okay.
-Yeah.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.533
So how many hobbies
does one elderly man need?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.268
Elderly? Thank you.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.073
Um, two aerobic. Preferably
three emotionally stimulating,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.244
and creative ones, and ah,
hopefully one culinary.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.046
Oh yes, the off milk.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.280
The Kefir.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.649
There must be a word
for someone like you?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.885
Who compulsively
collects hobbies.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.187
Yeah, yeah. Changeling.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.755
Bon vivant. Is that a word?

18:43.822 --> 18:44.590
[Lauren laughs]

18:44.656 --> 18:46.125
-Enigma.
-Enigma.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.360
I was thinking more like
of a hobby hoarder.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.430
-Ah, it's two words.
-So bon vivant though.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.031
Well you can piss off
because you're just jealous.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.099
Yeah I am jealous,

18:54.166 --> 18:56.134
I'm jealous of someone
who has time for hobbies.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.636
Jealously is a curse so...

18:57.703 --> 18:59.271
[Alex] And Anna scores
the winning point.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.639
It was beautiful.
[cheers and whoops]

19:00.706 --> 19:02.040
Show us that pivot Alex.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.145
Oh look at that, look at that.
Look, he's so flexible.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.881
It's all in the hip swing.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.349
Yeah. Hot yoga.

19:10.415 --> 19:11.817
Don't give him
another hobby, please.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.419
Hot yoga? Yes good for
the core stability too.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.287
Oh god.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.924
[Matt] Yeah, see ya later.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.362
You should carve out some
me time for yourself Loz.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.796
Should I?

19:24.863 --> 19:28.300
Just something simple,
and wholesome.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.036
A way to while away the few
years you've got left.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.804
If you tell me
to start quilting

19:32.871 --> 19:34.806
I may have to
vomit on your face.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.276
We should quilt.
We should totally quilt.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.244
-I have an overlocker.
-I bet you have.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.879
I bought one in a garage sale.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.180
[upbeat music]

19:42.247 --> 19:44.349
[Helena] So, did you
find the necklace?

19:44.416 --> 19:46.351
Ah, I'm working on it.
I'll find it.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.154
[Helena] Rosa hey.
Give him back his football.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.556
What about all
your clutterjunk?

19:50.622 --> 19:51.857
You finish clearing out?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.759
Clutterjunk is not a word.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.028
Oh my god! You should paint.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.030
I don't need to paint.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.766
Well I just did my front door.
Did you get the pictures?

20:00.832 --> 20:01.667
Yeah, seven of them.

20:01.733 --> 20:02.935
So much better, right?

20:03.001 --> 20:05.804
Ah, wasn't it already
a sort of pinky brown?

20:06.000 --> 20:06.805
Flynn!

20:06.872 --> 20:08.240
[Door bell]
Oh got to go.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.575
Find my necklace.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.110
I will, I will.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.683
Hey. Oh!

20:18.000 --> 20:18.684
Oh!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.285
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.354
Sorry, I was just
getting ready for bed.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.791
Yeah. Ah, I was just
thinking...

20:30.000 --> 20:30.395
-You okay?
-Yeah, are you?

20:30.462 --> 20:31.063
Yeah.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.664
Yeah, I was thinking
today was really fun.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.033
-Yeah it was.
-Hanging out and...

20:36.000 --> 20:36.368
It was really fun.

20:36.935 --> 20:37.803
Hm.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.871
-Having a laugh and...
-Hm.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.240
Just thought maybe you...

20:42.307 --> 20:43.108
Yeah.

20:43.175 --> 20:43.976
-Yeah.
-Hm.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.845
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I think so.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.353
[Alex laughing] Well
this is a shit show.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.455
Yeah, it'll be fine
if I avoid him.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.756
Yeah, well that's
going to be easy,

21:00.000 --> 21:00.158
He's your friend,
he's your neighbour,

21:00.225 --> 21:02.060
he's Jake's best mate,
he's the local paramedic.

21:02.127 --> 21:05.631
Yeah, I won't get injured, I'll
avoid all paramedic
emergencies.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.666
You do realise you can't
sleep with him ever again.

21:07.733 --> 21:08.500
Yeah, yeah.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.401
'Cause that's three times
right?

21:09.468 --> 21:11.336
-Exactly, yeah.
-And then you know?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.339
-Unless you want a--
-No, do I want a boyfriend?

21:14.406 --> 21:15.741
No!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.645
[upbeat music]

21:24.000 --> 21:27.886
[Ange] Oh Lauren, before
I forget. I found this.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.721
Oh my goodness!

21:30.000 --> 21:30.856
I know! Remember
you nearly lost it

21:30.922 --> 21:32.924
in that poker game
with the tree surgeon.

21:32.991 --> 21:33.992
Yes!

21:34.059 --> 21:35.494
Yes. I sorted it out.
So it's fine.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.430
Thank you. I've been
looking for it. Thanks so much.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.232
Oh I appreciate it. Thank you.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.167
Oh it's a pleasure.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.102
[Alex] Well I for one am
thrilled we spent so long

21:44.302 --> 21:46.505
rummaging around that
disgusting house for absolutely
no reason.

21:46.571 --> 21:47.906
I thought it had slipped off.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.308
[Dallas] I have
a delivery for ah...

21:51.076 --> 21:53.211
[Alex] Oh shit, shit, shit,
shit! I'll call security.

21:54.000 --> 21:54.112
No. No, wait.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.314
-[Dallas] Angela Cook.
-Yes, that's me.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.984
-Hi.
-Hello.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.287
Did you order a Dallas'
Delicious Hamper for Ange?

22:02.354 --> 22:03.488
[Lauren] Hm-hm.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.758
Well we have a ready made match
making tool at our finger tips.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.760
[Alex] Look at you
being a good witch.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.795
[Lauren] Yeah.

22:09.861 --> 22:10.729
You actually used
the Spreadsheet

22:12.000 --> 22:13.498
to provide someone with
real human companionship.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.535
-Yeah, well
-That was, that was quick.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.303
[Lauren] Well, he's
a fast charmer.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.272
[woman] Mr Cook.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.710
[Alex] Hmm.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.478
-Did he just wink at you?
-Hmm?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.517
Um, I didn't really
want to tell you this now.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.852
[laughs nervously]
Has anyone ever told

22:36.000 --> 22:36.788
you've got like a very
penetrating gaze.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.290
Peter Cook offered
me a job in London.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.991
-Right.
-Hm.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.794
Well, not so much a
job as a promotion,

22:42.861 --> 22:45.030
like a really
big promotion.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.203
Lots more money, some really
big clients and it's in London.

22:51.269 --> 22:52.971
Yeah, you said.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.706
England.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.908
Great.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.179
[gentle music]

23:02.347 --> 23:05.417
[turns tap off]
London, England.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.987
In London, England. I know
where fucking London is!

23:12.000 --> 23:13.959
Fucking snake, Peter bloody
Cook poaching my best friend.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.594
I don't have a dining table.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.262
I don't have a fucking bed,

23:18.000 --> 23:18.897
and this clock can fuck off!

23:18.964 --> 23:20.265
You bitch! You can fuck off!

23:24.000 --> 23:24.035
Come on, piece of shit,
get off!

23:24.102 --> 23:26.805
Come on, get off!

23:26.872 --> 23:29.141
[electrical crackling]

23:30.000 --> 23:31.777
[Lauren screams] Oh
