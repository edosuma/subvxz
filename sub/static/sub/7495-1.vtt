00:26.693 --> 00:30.029
You kill your film several times...

00:30.280 --> 00:32.865
...mostly by talking about it.

00:34.617 --> 00:38.037
A film is a dream.
You kill it writing it down...

00:38.204 --> 00:39.872
...you kill it with a camera.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.416
The film might come to life
for a moment or two...

00:42.584 --> 00:45.461
...when actors breathe life into it,
but then it dies again...

00:45.628 --> 00:48.088
...buried in film cans.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.802
Mysteriously, sometimes,
in the editing room...

00:54.471 --> 00:57.473
...a miracle happens when you place
one image next to another...

00:57.640 --> 01:01.143
...so that when, finally,
an audience sits in the dark...

01:01.478 --> 01:03.062
...if you're lucky...

01:03.229 --> 01:05.022
...very lucky...

01:05.899 --> 01:08.400
And sometimes I've been lucky.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.446
- The dream flickers
back to life again.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.326
That's why I'm secretive.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.622
So, what's your favorite pasta?

01:22.499 --> 01:25.000
Finally, a serious question.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.072
Good luck, maestro.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.057
Maestro, maestro, maestro.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.519
Maestro Contini.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.730
How do you begin?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.942
How do you begin this thing?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.780
Page one, page one, page one.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.325
Page nothing.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.290
Guido, you're here.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.710
Been looking for you all over.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.254
The set's coming along, eh?
How are you?

06:23.549 --> 06:25.634
My God, you look terrible.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.221
Better go to Makeup.
Forgot you got a press conference?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.474
- He has no tie.
- Yes. Makeup and Wardrobe.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.477
- Signor Contini, I'm Fausto Milletti...
- He's counting costs.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.646
- The bank wants him here.
- Signor Contini...

06:37.814 --> 06:39.648
Don't speak to him. I speak to him.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.819
Okay. I have some questions
for Signor Contini.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.821
We all have questions
for Signor Contini.

06:45.988 --> 06:50.492
Yes, but please, I think it's customary
for there to be an approved script...

06:50.660 --> 06:53.328
...and budget before filming...
- Is he going to follow us?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.747
It's not my intention
to be difficult, maestro.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.166
I am a huge admirer of
Maestro Contini's movies.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.669
Your early films are...
Everybody loves them...

07:00.837 --> 07:03.797
...and I consider it a great honor
for me to be here now.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.633
But it's... Nonetheless,
I need a script and the budget.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.885
- Where do you want your messages?
- On my desk.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.013
- There's no room on your desk.
- Under my desk, in the trash.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.433
- Some of these are urgent.
- Get me a cigarette.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.769
We will never be ready
to shoot in 10 days.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.438
What? Not ready?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.773
Careful what you say.
He's a spy from the bank.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.109
He's not exactly
from the bank, Guido.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.570
You have actors waiting.
Auditions all morning.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.697
You should see what I found.
Two sisters.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.533
Look, they're right...
Dottore, this way!

07:36.706 --> 07:38.707
I need a cigarette.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.709
He needs a shirt and a tie, Lilli.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.544
I need a coffee and a cigarette.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.046
Answer a question,
I'll give you a coffee.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.049
Answer another, I'll give you
a cigarette. And so on.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.551
Actually, and an aspirin.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.052
- We're late.
- Calm down.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.557
Directing a movie is a very
overrated job, we all know it.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.810
You just have to say yes or no.
What else do you do? Nothing.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.062
"Should this be red?" "Yes."
"Green?" "No."

08:01.230 --> 08:03.231
"More extras?" "Yes."
"More lipstick?" "No."

08:03.399 --> 08:06.568
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.
That's directing.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.196
That's right, that's directing.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.158
It doesn't seem to make a blind bit of
difference, finally, what the answer is.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.243
So, please, Guido...

08:15.411 --> 08:17.078
...yes or no.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.915
Do you want any costumes
in this film?

08:20.958 --> 08:23.793
- Yes.
- You see? Simple.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.630
Might I know what period
the movie's in?

08:26.797 --> 08:28.256
Yes.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.884
Soon.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.553
You know, I don't allow
producers in here.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.931
All right. Okay.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.265
Two minutes, Guido.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.727
He's gone.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.982
Have you written
a word of the script?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.400
No.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.194
Are you in a panic?

08:51.697 --> 08:52.739
Yes.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.867
- Is Luisa going with you?
- No, nobody.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.202
Dante.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.788
- And his spy.
- You need to shave.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.124
- You look terrible.
- Why is there no fire escape in here?

09:03.292 --> 09:05.043
What if somebody
needed to escape?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.296
I can't face these reporters.
I have nothing to say.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.090
You'II be fine.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.301
You're a world-class liar, darling.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.137
Go out there and lie for Italy.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.640
Lie for Italia.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.986
What the hell's wrong with me?

09:31.153 --> 09:35.490
I can't sleep, I can't think,
I can't write, I can't breathe.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.493
My heart is racing.
Am I dying, Mama?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.580
I owe you flowers, I know.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.623
I'll come to the cemetery
at the weekend.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.252
You should have let me bury you
in Roma, Mama.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.962
I could visit you every week.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.258
Don't look at me like that.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.844
Oh, Guido, Guido.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.182
This is your Rome, Guido.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.769
The world sees Rome
the way you invented it.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.439
Your films did that.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.149
I miss you.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.817
I miss you too.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.694
Oh, let's go!

10:30.046 --> 10:33.882
And we are just waiting for the arrival
of Contini any moment now.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.218
Could this film put
the maestro back on top?

10:37.386 --> 10:39.387
And here he is!

10:46.228 --> 10:49.230
- Thank you for coming.
- Be nice.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.107
Thank you, thank you.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.194
Dante, Guido Contini's longtime
producer, is about to speak.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.321
I want to say a few words
from my heart.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.323
I'm humbled and thrilled
to announce...

10:58.491 --> 11:02.744
...that I'm producing Guido Contini's
next film, Italia...

11:03.788 --> 11:08.249
...which will star, once again,
Contini's longtime inspiration...

11:08.417 --> 11:12.003
...the international film star
Claudia Jenssen.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.425
We start shooting
in 10 days' time in Cinecitta.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.344
That makes it one week
from Monday.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.680
Thank you, maestro,
thank you very much.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.349
This is our ninth film together.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.686
- Guido Contini.
- Thanks for coming, everybody.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.566
Maestro Contini, Maestro Contini.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.360
Yes.

11:35.945 --> 11:40.365
Maestro Contini, your new film
is called Italia. Big title.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.450
Actually, it's my shortest title yet.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.369
But hardly a modest one.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.621
But films are not modest.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.873
They cost too much,
they take too long...

11:49.041 --> 11:51.793
...and they involve
too many people, so...

11:51.961 --> 11:54.045
They should have grand titles.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.631
And might you tell the press
what the film is about?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.217
Why?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.306
I don't know what
my last film's about.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.600
That was the problem.
Nobody else did.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.647
Of course I can tell you
what my film is about.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.233
I can tell you the story,
I can tell you...

12:15.401 --> 12:19.988
...who I'm going to cast and the music
I want to use. I can tell you everything.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.573
But I won't.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.160
I'm afraid if I say anything
the word might get out to the press.

12:26.328 --> 12:30.540
Our next film will be exactly
as it sounds: Italia.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.208
It's the very spirit of Italy.

12:32.376 --> 12:36.671
Italy as a myth, Italy as a woman,
Italy as a dream.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.006
Is this true?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.176
It sounds fantastic.
I can't wait to see it.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.094
Do you consider pornography art?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.348
- Signor Contini.
- Stephanie.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.768
Could you tell the fashionable women
of America...

12:49.935 --> 12:51.936
...who your favorite designer
is this year?

12:52.104 --> 12:55.356
I'm less interested in the wrapping
than what might be inside it.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.486
Signor Contini,
you are a man of the world, yes?

12:59.653 --> 13:02.280
Educated in Britain,
a home in Biarritz.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.617
With Italia, is it fair to say
that you've come home for good?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.619
- For good?
- It's been a long time...

13:07.787 --> 13:09.704
...since you made a movie
with your wife.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.081
Do you plan on casting her
in this new film?

13:12.249 --> 13:13.875
I told Luisa when we got married...

13:14.043 --> 13:16.503
...that I'd never again
make love to my leading lady.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.547
But she hasn't worked at all
since working with you.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.718
But why are you being so tight-lipped
about this film?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.554
It's a serious question.
What's the big deal?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.892
I would like to be here

13:32.895 --> 13:35.647
You want me to be serious
in a press conference?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.233
I would like to be there

13:39.235 --> 13:41.653
I thought I was the clown
in this circus.

13:42.488 --> 13:46.157
I would like to be
Everywhere at once

13:46.325 --> 13:48.993
I know that's a contradiction in terms

13:49.161 --> 13:52.747
Signor Contini, artists do their
best work before they're famous.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.499
Now you're famous.

13:54.667 --> 13:59.337
Without wishing to be negative,
but your last two films, they are not...

13:59.505 --> 14:01.381
- They were...
- Flops?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.674
Your word, "flops."

14:02.842 --> 14:06.594
And it's a problem, especially when

14:06.762 --> 14:11.558
My body's nearing 50
As my mind is nearing 10

14:11.725 --> 14:15.270
I'm just asking if you're nervous.
You seem nervous.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.648
- Excuse me?
- What I am asking, maestro...

14:18.816 --> 14:21.818
...is have you run out
of things to say?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.779
I can hardly stay up

14:24.947 --> 14:26.698
And I can't get to sleep

14:26.866 --> 14:29.617
And I don't want to wake
Tomorrow morning

14:29.785 --> 14:31.619
At the bottom of some heap

14:31.787 --> 14:34.747
But why take it so seriously?

14:35.374 --> 14:39.377
After all, there's nothing at stake here
Only me

14:39.879 --> 14:41.588
I want to be young

14:41.881 --> 14:43.798
And I want to be old

14:44.133 --> 14:46.384
I would like to be wise
Before my time

14:46.552 --> 14:48.511
And yet be foolish
And brash and bold

14:48.679 --> 14:51.097
I would like the universe
To get down on its knees

14:51.265 --> 14:53.099
And say
"Guido, whatever you please

14:53.267 --> 14:57.645
It's okay even if it's impossible
We'll arrange it"

15:01.317 --> 15:02.650
That's all that I want

15:03.068 --> 15:06.321
I was wondering if there's a limit
to what you can show in a movie.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.991
What would you like to see
that I haven't already shown you?

15:12.453 --> 15:16.080
I am lusting for more

15:16.248 --> 15:17.749
Should I settle for less?

15:18.500 --> 15:22.462
I ask you, what's a good thing for
If not for taking it to excess?

15:23.005 --> 15:26.132
One limitation I dearly regret

15:26.342 --> 15:30.595
There's only one of me
I've ever met

15:36.602 --> 15:37.936
If you have any questions...

15:38.103 --> 15:41.105
I would like to have another me

15:41.273 --> 15:44.108
To travel along with myself

15:44.777 --> 15:47.445
I would even like to be able to sing

15:47.613 --> 15:51.282
A duet with myself

15:51.784 --> 15:54.369
I would like to be here
Sing along with myself in a song

15:54.536 --> 15:56.621
To be there
Walking down a lane now

15:56.789 --> 15:58.539
Everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere

15:58.707 --> 16:00.875
That's a contradiction in terms
I want to be

16:01.043 --> 16:02.961
Here, with a counter
Here, melody in the

16:03.128 --> 16:06.005
Here
Top of the morning to you, Guido

16:06.173 --> 16:11.135
Guido, Guido, Guido, Guido, Guido

16:11.303 --> 16:12.720
Me, me, me!

16:12.888 --> 16:14.806
I want to be Proust

16:14.974 --> 16:16.724
Or the Marquis de Sade

16:16.892 --> 16:19.143
I would like to be Christ
Muhammad, Buddha

16:19.311 --> 16:21.020
But not have to believe in God

16:21.188 --> 16:24.565
And you know I mean it
With all of my heart

16:24.984 --> 16:29.237
It's the end if something important
Doesn't start

16:29.405 --> 16:33.658
I want to be young
But I have to be old

16:33.826 --> 16:36.369
What I want is a tale
Of sound and fury

16:36.537 --> 16:38.079
That some idiot went and told

16:38.247 --> 16:40.832
I would like the universe
To get down on its knees

16:41.000 --> 16:43.501
And say
"Guido, whatever you please, it's okay

16:43.669 --> 16:47.171
Even if it's ridiculous
We'll arrange it"

16:54.513 --> 16:58.516
So arrange it!

16:59.018 --> 17:03.271
Arrange it!

17:04.272 --> 17:05.356
That's all that I want!

17:15.367 --> 17:19.119
Guido, Guido

17:19.288 --> 17:21.289
Guido

17:23.083 --> 17:26.752
Guido, Guido

17:26.920 --> 17:35.219
Guido

17:35.387 --> 17:37.889
Contini, Contini, Contini
Contini, Contini, Contini

17:38.057 --> 17:40.391
Contini, Contini, Guido

17:40.559 --> 17:43.436
Guido

17:51.153 --> 17:52.820
- I need a room.
- Of course.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.405
- A suite.
- Yes.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.491
With a view of the sea, a balcony.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.077
Something with air.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.663
All of our suites have air.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.582
Let me just look for you.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.418
- I've come from Milano.
- I understand.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.004
On business. I'm a businessman.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.256
Busy, busy, busy.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.594
Would Maestro Contini prefer
to register under a pseudonym?

18:18.514 --> 18:22.100
- Please.
- Signor Milano?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.309
Why not?

18:23.477 --> 18:25.937
Needless to say, I love your films.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.355
A guilty pleasure.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.148
Those early films.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.608
Not the flops.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.196
I need to see a doctor.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.948
Do you know one who's discreet?

18:37.116 --> 18:40.993
I'd like to see him today in my room.
Now, if possible.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.286
Consider it done.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.081
Please.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.875
- And I need to place a call to my wife.
- Yes.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.628
Here.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.382
You can take the call
at the lobby phone over there.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.302
Luisa.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.221
There you are.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.223
Is everybody mad at me?

19:02.391 --> 19:05.393
Well, I'm mad at you.
Where are you?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.895
I had to escape from
the press conference.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.231
Oh, I heard. Dramatic.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.733
Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.819
You're making a film.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.405
You make a film, you get sick.
It's what happens.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.408
No, but this time I'm really sick.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.201
I can't breathe.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.328
Are you by yourself?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.247
Yes, of course I'm by myself.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.748
Then shall I come?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.334
Yes, please come.
That's why I'm calling.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.087
Please come straightaway.
It'd be wonderful.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.589
Okay.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.926
Great. Marvelous.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.012
I don't know where you are.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.597
I don't know.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.600
Some spa, it's horrible.
I just kept driving.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.644
Well, I can't come if I don't know
where you are.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.356
Actually, you know, it's hardly worth it.
I'll be home in a day or two.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.067
Yeah.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.529
Yes, it's hardly worth it.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.073
I do wish you were here.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.202
Get some rest.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.371
Take the waters, sleep...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.750
...then come back here
and make a good movie.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.627
I love you.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.045
Get better.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.519
Oh, your doctor is on his way.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.647
This number...

20:32.814 --> 20:35.316
...if a woman answers,
you put it through to my room.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.943
Otherwise...

20:37.110 --> 20:38.653
It's a wrong number.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.995
What?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.712
What is she whispering?
Is it about my blood pressure?

20:56.880 --> 21:00.383
- Is it serious? Am I dying?
- Stress. Exhaustion.

21:00.550 --> 21:04.178
Your liver, your heart, your kidneys,
they're all very cross with you.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.347
Guido

21:06.932 --> 21:08.599
Open wide.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.519
But you've come to the right place.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.938
There are a dozen mineral springs...

21:14.106 --> 21:16.691
Guido

21:17.776 --> 21:18.818
Careful.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.697
Signor Contini? It's the signora.

21:22.864 --> 21:26.659
I was lazing around my bedroom
When you called

21:26.827 --> 21:30.121
And an idea occurred to me
I thought you might be

21:31.456 --> 21:34.709
Wondering about

21:35.711 --> 21:37.044
Guido

21:37.212 --> 21:40.798
This is a very important call, doctor.
I have to take it. A private call.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.133
As you wish.

21:42.301 --> 21:47.221
Who's not wearing any clothes?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.724
I'm not!

21:50.309 --> 21:52.226
My darling

21:52.394 --> 21:56.897
Who's afraid to kiss your toes?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.734
I'm not!

22:00.736 --> 22:04.739
Your mama dear

22:04.906 --> 22:09.577
Is blowing into your ear

22:09.745 --> 22:14.582
So you'II get it loud and clear

22:15.250 --> 22:20.671
I need you to squeeze me here

22:21.173 --> 22:28.763
And here

22:29.097 --> 22:31.766
Dottore, his pulse, it's racing.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.186
- Is something wrong?
- What?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.730
Yes, yes, it's about my film.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.899
It's from the Vatican.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.234
Go ahead, Monsignor.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.737
Yes, yes, of course I'm listening.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.783
Cootchie, cootchie, cootchie coo

22:50.035 --> 22:52.620
I've got

22:53.121 --> 22:59.794
A plan for what I'm gonna do to you

23:00.545 --> 23:02.463
So hot

23:03.382 --> 23:06.717
You're gonna steam

23:06.885 --> 23:10.304
And scream

23:10.472 --> 23:15.810
And vibrate like a string I'm plucking

23:15.977 --> 23:20.439
Kiss your fevered little brow

23:21.066 --> 23:25.319
Pinch your cheeks till you say "Ow"

23:25.654 --> 23:31.283
And I can hardly wait
To show you how

23:31.451 --> 23:33.994
Guido

23:34.162 --> 23:37.331
Who won't care if you come to me

23:37.499 --> 23:40.126
Tired and overworked?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.086
I won't!

23:42.254 --> 23:44.171
Bambino

23:44.339 --> 23:49.343
Who knows a therapy to beat
What you can get from me?

23:49.511 --> 23:53.514
I don't!

23:56.852 --> 24:01.522
But this will

24:02.149 --> 24:07.611
Have to be enough for now

24:11.366 --> 24:16.203
Guido

24:21.793 --> 24:23.210
Ciao

24:36.892 --> 24:39.852
I love you, Guido.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.571
Guido!

24:51.823 --> 24:53.532
Ciao!

24:54.117 --> 24:55.159
Carla.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.787
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Carla. Carlissima.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.373
I missed you so much.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.251
- Are you happy I'm here?
- Of course.

25:04.419 --> 25:07.796
- But very happy or just a little happy?
- Very happy.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.465
What's wrong?

25:09.633 --> 25:12.760
- You look very tired.
- All these bags for one weekend?

25:12.928 --> 25:16.013
Yes, the Bellavista is
a very fashionable place.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.390
I stayed there with my parents
during the war.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.519
- There's something I have to tell you.
- It was full of Germans.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.687
They found out who I am
at the hotel.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.356
- No.
- Yes, yes.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.191
It's horrible, but...

25:27.359 --> 25:29.527
We don't want to be followed
by the press.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.862
I found the most charming
pensione for you.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.406
It's right here, it's charming.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.076
Here at the station?

25:48.213 --> 25:50.214
Close the curtains.
It's too light in here.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.220
Perfect. Go into the corridor.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.596
- What?
- Yes.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.891
Count to 10, then come back in.
Pretend you're in the wrong room...

26:01.059 --> 26:03.227
...and I'm a complete stranger.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.188
I love your games.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.316
I'm here on business.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.652
- Okay.
- Go, go. Wait, wait. Your face.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.654
- What about it?
- Get your makeup.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.328
I had a nightmare last night.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.915
We were in that little alley behind
Piazza Navona...

26:25.083 --> 26:27.167
...where I bought you the scarf,
remember?

26:27.502 --> 26:30.045
- The same one your wife bought you.
- Don't move, Carla.

26:30.213 --> 26:33.424
When you wear it,
I never know if it's hers or mine.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.761
So we were there
on the ground, naked, kissing.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.763
And we didn't care.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.349
And then my husband arrived
and killed us both.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.226
With a shovel.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.437
Poor Luigi.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.023
He would never do that.
He's so sweet.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.359
He speaks Latin.
He knows all the Roman emperors.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.028
Good for him.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.865
Perhaps there is a job for him
in the movie.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.325
Why not?

26:59.492 --> 27:02.369
You could work well together.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.580
Beautiful.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.582
When you come in...

27:06.750 --> 27:09.043
...I want you to be my little savage.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.545
- Yes.
- Go, go.

27:11.713 --> 27:15.549
- You think I'm one of your actresses.
- Hurry, please, Carla.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.223
I'll pretend to be asleep.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.478
What if I really found
the wrong room?

27:27.646 --> 27:30.230
- Would you be jealous?
- Could you do such a thing?

27:31.149 --> 27:32.816
Who knows?

27:46.206 --> 27:48.666
- What happened?
- It was the woman...

27:48.833 --> 27:51.752
The woman from the hotel.
She wanted to give me towels.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.632
- Come here.
- Okay.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.425
- What?
- You are a stranger.

27:58.593 --> 28:01.637
- I don't know you.
- No, Carla, just come here, huh?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.723
Be savage.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.519
Show me.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.273
Excuse me.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.236
I've got the wrong room.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.947
Yes, you have.

28:20.532 --> 28:24.201
And I don't have the faintest idea
who you are.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.345
Page one.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.473
Page one, page one, page one.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.309
The figure emerges
from the darkness...

28:49.477 --> 28:50.978
...like a goddess.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.730
She is Claudia...

28:52.897 --> 28:54.231
...his muse.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.318
She takes the man's face
and kisses him.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.154
And with that gesture...

29:00.321 --> 29:04.408
...he is suddenly inspired
to write something...

29:05.076 --> 29:07.077
...profound.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.459
Mother of God, give me a sign.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.649
Excuse me, Father.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.195
- His Excellency, the cardinal, is he...?
- Signor Contini. I'm a big fan.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.655
I'd like to speak to the cardinal.
Do you think...?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.491
Is Claudia Jenssen with you?

29:47.494 --> 29:48.869
- No.
- Pity.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.830
His Excellency is a big admirer
of Signorina Jenssen.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.958
I'm in need of some guidance,
some pointers...

29:55.126 --> 29:58.378
Do you think you can find a signed
photograph of Signorina Jenssen?

29:59.547 --> 30:01.548
For His Excellency?

30:02.509 --> 30:04.134
I'm sure it would be possible.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.637
Truly? What a pleasure.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.559
Guido.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.895
Guidino.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.356
I'm not going to ask
how you found me.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.899
Oh, please, it's my job.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.736
A producer needs to know
where his director is at all times.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.531
Even to know the pensione
where his mistress is staying.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.908
- Oh, God.
- I understand, Guido.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.077
I mean, Rome is
absolutely unbearable.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.246
The pressure? It's not good.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.916
- Really? You understand?
- Of course I understand, absolutely.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.335
- You're not going to drag me back?
- No, no, no.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.338
You're a genius
and genius must be served.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.590
Thank you, my old friend.

30:43.758 --> 30:44.925
Where are we going?

30:45.093 --> 30:47.594
You can't be in Rome, okay.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.264
Rome will come to you.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.934
It's a fantastic place
for you to focus.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.271
Everyone is here to help the movie.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.940
Everyone is here
because they love you, Guido.

31:01.734 --> 31:05.362
Look, with the flower and the grass,
and the arches of the empire.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.281
- I like this.
- Guido.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.908
Guido, remember Donatella?

31:10.076 --> 31:11.535
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.537
Donatella. You tested her.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.082
I was very nervous.
He probably doesn't remember.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.959
I was quite nervous.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.336
No, I remember you. You were...

31:21.504 --> 31:22.880
We all enjoyed you.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.339
So to speak.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.258
Maestro.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.302
Claudia's agent.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.055
Did she like the script?

31:32.307 --> 31:35.267
No. No, no, no.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.603
Are you telling me
she didn't get the script?

31:37.770 --> 31:39.396
Pierpaolo!

31:39.772 --> 31:42.149
Claudia didn't get the script.
Send her another one!

31:42.317 --> 31:44.568
- Send her two!
- Yes, I'm sorry...

31:44.736 --> 31:46.320
Yeah, right now.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.908
That's what I say. People don't realize
she's an actress as well as a star.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.827
I know Dante's dying to talk to you.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.248
Yap, yap, yap.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.090
What are we doing here?

32:07.258 --> 32:09.968
I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.472
It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.641
What? No!

32:16.017 --> 32:17.643
Oh, please, God, no.

32:17.977 --> 32:21.271
I spoke with her yesterday.
She didn't even mention it.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.148
Give me a cigarette.

32:23.316 --> 32:29.529
What's that?

32:29.697 --> 32:31.198
- It's for Claudia.
- Which scene?

32:31.366 --> 32:34.034
Well, I don't know which scene
till I've seen the script.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.661
She likes something like this.

32:35.828 --> 32:39.039
Looks like Folies Bergeres.
Italian women don't wear those things.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.874
Don't knock the Folies Bergeres.

32:41.042 --> 32:45.003
It brings back happy memories.
It's where I learned my art.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.923
All those sequins, all those feathers.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.592
And you're wrong.

32:51.010 --> 32:54.388
You put Claudia in one of these for
that nightclub scene in Natura Morta.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.307
Why did people love that film?

32:57.475 --> 32:58.892
Oh, Guido.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.894
Don't. That's death.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.897
- Every time we have to start again.
- I'm trying to find it.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.566
You won't with your head
jammed halfway up your ass.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.528
Ashtray.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.240
Thanks. You were saying my head
is jammed up my ass.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.783
Halfway.

33:14.951 --> 33:18.495
I don't know. Why not dream up
something entertaining, Guido?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.748
Something with music,
with dancing.

33:21.916 --> 33:25.252
God knows we could use a little
joie de vivre around here.

33:27.213 --> 33:31.049
Le cinema today is in a crisis

33:31.259 --> 33:34.928
Directors are so existentialistes

33:35.930 --> 33:39.766
The movies are not worth
Their entrance prices

33:40.101 --> 33:43.895
If no one sings a love song
When he's kissed

33:45.398 --> 33:50.402
Love cannot be love
Without le singing

33:50.903 --> 33:55.240
A string, a clarinet, a saxophone

33:55.908 --> 33:59.244
Take a lesson from
This old Parisienne

33:59.412 --> 34:04.082
And the finest entertainment

34:04.250 --> 34:08.462
She has known

34:16.094 --> 34:20.431
Oh, what a showing of color
Costume and dancing!

34:21.266 --> 34:25.270
Not a moment in life
Could be more entrancing

34:25.938 --> 34:30.650
Than an evening you spend
Aux Folies Bergeres

34:35.489 --> 34:39.826
Not a soul in the world
Could be in despair

34:40.286 --> 34:44.623
When he is glancing

34:45.123 --> 34:48.960
At the fabulous stage
Des Folies Bergeres

35:36.384 --> 35:39.719
"Vedette," it means "star."

35:39.887 --> 35:41.179
Let me tell you.

35:41.347 --> 35:44.683
Last night I looked down
at this table...

35:44.851 --> 35:47.644
...in the chairs you are sitting in now,
and what do I see?

35:47.812 --> 35:50.730
A priest. And next to him...

35:54.819 --> 35:57.320
Guido? Guido Contini.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.323
What are you doing here?
At the Folies Bergeres?

36:00.491 --> 36:03.243
You naughty boy.
You're only 9 years old.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.954
But I'm glad you've come.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.957
Would you like to join me on-stage?
Yes, come.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.585
Come, come, come. Come.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.546
Come. Feeling better?

36:14.714 --> 36:17.465
There's no room for hopelessness
here, is there, Guido?

36:17.633 --> 36:20.594
We must explain something
to our young Guido.

36:21.053 --> 36:24.181
What do we want? Laughter.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.267
What do we want? Love.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.937
What do we want? Dreams.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.525
Let's not forget, Guido, mon cher,
that is our privilege...

36:35.693 --> 36:37.277
...to entertain!

36:40.281 --> 36:43.742
The music, the lights
And the laughter

36:43.910 --> 36:46.745
The answer to what you are after

36:46.913 --> 36:50.540
Each night at the Folies Bergeres

36:53.794 --> 36:57.631
By the heavens above
You will swear

36:57.798 --> 37:01.218
There is nothing rarer

37:01.385 --> 37:08.808
Than the Folies Bergeres

37:15.149 --> 37:17.984
The stage overflowing and giving

37:18.152 --> 37:21.321
A musical reason for living

37:21.489 --> 37:25.784
Each night at the Folies Bergeres

37:28.329 --> 37:32.457
To your modern ideas I compare

37:32.625 --> 37:35.502
One derriere!

37:35.670 --> 37:40.465
At the Folies Bergeres

37:40.633 --> 37:43.843
The answer to what you are after

37:44.011 --> 37:47.347
The music, the lights
And the laughter

37:48.432 --> 37:57.399
Of the Folies Bergeres

38:57.460 --> 39:00.170
The cardinal is right this way.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.260
Your Eminence,
Signor Contini's here.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.567
I like Charlie Chaplin.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.111
Me too.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.863
A genius.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.575
What can I do for you?

39:32.453 --> 39:33.620
Do you believe in God?

39:33.788 --> 39:35.121
Signor Contini, please.

39:35.289 --> 39:38.124
No, no, it's an honest question.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.877
Yes, I believe in God.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.462
So do I.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.672
Are you a Catholic?

39:45.341 --> 39:47.634
Oh, yes, very much so.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.594
Not as much as I would like to be.

39:49.762 --> 39:53.848
Not as much as you would like me
to be, I'm sure, but certainly, yes...

39:54.016 --> 39:55.266
...I'm trying.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.686
- Try harder.
- Yes. I will.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.315
I will, Your Eminence. I...

40:04.819 --> 40:06.236
I'm not happy. I...

40:06.612 --> 40:09.114
I'm searching for something.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.616
I feel a sense of misery, of despair.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.451
I saw your films.

40:13.619 --> 40:16.413
Not the flops, the others.
The good ones.

40:16.997 --> 40:20.291
But do you think people need to see
so much sex?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.502
It's not necessary.

40:22.878 --> 40:26.548
- No.
- We can all imagine.

40:26.715 --> 40:30.677
Excuse me, but my films
are what I imagine.

40:30.845 --> 40:34.514
Then your imagination
has no moral training.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.975
How do you train the imagination?

40:37.143 --> 40:40.854
Imagination is God's garden.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.982
Don't let the devil play in it.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.444
Teach our Italian women
to be wives...

40:47.611 --> 40:49.154
...not whores.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.532
Don't make us look at
filth and debauchery.

40:52.700 --> 40:56.161
Make us proud to be Italian.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.013
The money, the money!

41:15.181 --> 41:17.807
We're going to get in trouble.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.728
That's good.

41:23.731 --> 41:29.110
Saraghina!

42:34.468 --> 42:38.179
So you little Italian devils...

42:38.347 --> 42:41.140
...you want to know about love?

42:42.309 --> 42:45.144
Saraghina will tell you.

42:45.646 --> 42:49.148
If you want to make
a woman happy...

42:49.316 --> 42:53.069
...you rely on what
you were born with.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.656
Because it is in your blood.

42:58.158 --> 43:05.790
Be Italian

43:06.625 --> 43:12.171
Take a chance
And try to steal a fiery kiss

43:13.132 --> 43:20.179
Be Italian

43:20.347 --> 43:23.725
When you hold me
Don't just hold me

43:23.892 --> 43:26.185
But hold this!

43:32.526 --> 43:36.529
Please be gentle

43:37.489 --> 43:40.366
Sentimental

43:41.452 --> 43:46.706
Go ahead and try
To give my cheek a pat

43:48.208 --> 43:51.628
But be daring

43:51.795 --> 43:54.881
And uncaring

43:55.049 --> 44:00.553
When you pinch me, try to pinch me
Where there's fat

44:02.056 --> 44:05.224
- Be a singer!
- Be a singer!

44:05.392 --> 44:08.519
- Be a lover!
- Be a lover!

44:08.687 --> 44:13.566
Pick the flower now
Before the chance is past

44:13.734 --> 44:14.817
Before it's past

44:15.361 --> 44:22.033
- Be Italian
- Be Italian

44:22.201 --> 44:28.039
Live today as if it may
Become your last!

45:48.787 --> 45:49.829
I'm gonna get you!

46:07.014 --> 46:13.686
Be a singer!

46:13.854 --> 46:17.648
- Be a lover!
- Be a lover!

46:17.816 --> 46:22.528
Pick the flower now
Before the chance is past

46:22.696 --> 46:24.989
Before it's past

46:25.157 --> 46:31.662
- Be Italian
- Be Italian

46:31.830 --> 46:34.832
Live today as if it may

46:35.292 --> 46:47.678
Become your last!

46:49.807 --> 46:59.273
Guido!

47:24.716 --> 47:26.384
I'm ashamed of you, Guido.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.427
But, Mama, what did I do?

47:28.595 --> 47:29.595
Bring him here.

47:31.181 --> 47:34.016
That savage is the devil.

47:35.561 --> 47:39.272
God will punish you for your sins
now and forever.

47:54.288 --> 47:55.746
What?

47:58.083 --> 48:01.752
- What?
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

48:03.297 --> 48:06.465
- I can't breathe.
- Don't die on me. Can you imagine?

48:06.633 --> 48:09.260
Poor Luigi, it would kill him.

48:09.428 --> 48:12.054
If I die, it would kill your husband?

48:12.222 --> 48:14.765
No, that's not what I meant.

48:14.933 --> 48:17.184
Guidino, no.

48:17.477 --> 48:21.105
- Where are you going?
- I have to work. Carla, I can't breathe.

48:21.273 --> 48:23.149
- Let me come with you.
- It's impossible.

48:23.317 --> 48:25.109
- Why?
- Because it's impossible. Please.

48:25.277 --> 48:26.986
But why is it impossible?

48:27.154 --> 48:28.821
Look at your producer.

48:28.989 --> 48:32.116
He's married. He brings his girlfriend
to work and nobody cares.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.786
Guido, everybody knows about me.
Why? Why won't you let me near you?

48:35.954 --> 48:38.497
The same reason you don't
want me to die on top of you.

48:38.665 --> 48:40.791
It's not fair to your husband,
to my wife.

48:40.959 --> 48:44.003
See, you're playing with me.
You're twisting everything.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.923
- Please let me come with you.
- No.

48:49.468 --> 48:52.094
I'll be here waiting for you,
with my legs open.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.863
Let's say there were...

49:11.031 --> 49:14.867
...10 sequences and each one's set
in a different period...

49:15.035 --> 49:16.827
...but played by the same cast.

49:16.995 --> 49:19.705
A man and a woman,
a woman and a man.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.458
Something light and hectic...

49:22.626 --> 49:24.835
...like Mozart would do, like Figaro.

49:25.003 --> 49:26.379
Like the circus.

49:26.546 --> 49:28.965
- Claudia's gonna be amazing.
- Sorry. Dante.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.008
You see, he hasn't written a word.

49:31.176 --> 49:35.554
A screenplay is first of all a map.
You know? That's a map.

49:35.722 --> 49:38.099
Let's try and dig for something else.

49:38.266 --> 49:40.226
Maybe a group of people digging...

49:40.394 --> 49:42.561
...with shovels, in the desert.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.647
Guido.

49:49.027 --> 49:50.069
Luisa?

49:54.533 --> 49:56.075
Is that his wife?

49:56.743 --> 49:58.411
I can't believe you came.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.539
The jungle drums
said it was an emergency.

50:01.707 --> 50:04.917
The jungle drums
exaggerated just a tiny bit.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.586
Not entirely.

50:07.754 --> 50:10.423
You haven't been sleeping.

50:10.882 --> 50:14.260
I was dying until just now.

50:14.428 --> 50:15.928
Come.

50:20.225 --> 50:22.393
Don't think I forgot your birthday.

50:22.561 --> 50:26.355
When you get home,
the house will be full of flowers.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.608
- Am I already going home?
- I hope not.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.945
Happy birthday, my darling.

50:38.744 --> 50:41.954
Here she is, at last.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.498
How magnificent.

50:44.916 --> 50:47.501
- Do you know Donatella?
- I do now.

50:47.669 --> 50:51.797
Luisa, she's a very, very nice lady.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.632
Thank you for calling.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.843
You're saving the movie.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.803
Give him a good idea,
for God's sake.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.306
Let's drink a toast
to Luisa's birthday.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.141
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.643
It was Monday.

51:04.811 --> 51:07.063
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.315
Happy birthday, darling.

51:10.817 --> 51:11.942
Maestro.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.986
Don Mario.

51:14.154 --> 51:16.155
Oh, excuse me, darling.
This is Don Mario.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.783
- This is my wife, Luisa.
- A pleasure, signora.

51:18.950 --> 51:20.284
Sit down, won't you?

51:20.452 --> 51:22.369
- No, no, no.
- Please, please, please.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.080
Thanks.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.668
I was telling your husband how much
I admire his movies.

51:29.836 --> 51:31.962
Publicly, you know,
the church condemns them.

51:32.130 --> 51:33.297
We have to.

51:33.465 --> 51:35.007
But we all love them.

51:35.175 --> 51:39.345
Last year we did our own version of
your II Vicolo at the Christmas party.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.138
That I'd pay to see.

51:41.306 --> 51:43.015
Yes, Luisa was in that film.

51:43.183 --> 51:45.476
- She was the best thing in the movie.
- It's true.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.478
It was your first part.

51:48.021 --> 51:51.148
Of course. You are Luisa Acari.
Oh, my Lord.

51:51.316 --> 51:52.775
I was.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.402
You can't stop being somebody.

51:55.570 --> 51:56.862
Can't you?

51:57.155 --> 52:00.366
Well, there is a good Catholic wife
for you, Guido.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.700
That's what they do.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.869
Sacrifice.

52:04.579 --> 52:09.083
Still, Signora Contini,
it must be a very exciting life for you.

52:10.293 --> 52:14.505
My husband makes movies

52:15.340 --> 52:19.343
To make them
He lives a kind of dream

52:20.220 --> 52:24.682
In which his actions aren't always
What they seem

52:25.559 --> 52:29.895
He may be on to some
Unique romantic theme

52:31.857 --> 52:34.233
Some men run banks

52:34.526 --> 52:36.527
Some rule the world

52:37.195 --> 52:41.448
Some earn their living baking bread

52:42.367 --> 52:46.912
My husband, he goes a little crazy

52:47.080 --> 52:52.668
Making movies instead

52:53.545 --> 52:58.215
My husband spins fantasies

52:58.717 --> 53:02.887
He lives them
Then gives them to you all

53:03.722 --> 53:08.434
Like Michelangelo
He paints his private dome

53:09.102 --> 53:14.106
But can't distinguish what's his work
And what's his home

53:15.775 --> 53:18.402
Some men sell stocks

53:18.570 --> 53:20.946
Some men punch clocks

53:21.406 --> 53:25.117
Some leap
Where others fear to tread

53:26.578 --> 53:31.457
My husband, as author and director

53:31.750 --> 53:37.296
Makes up stories in his head

53:54.648 --> 53:58.651
Guido Contini, Luisa Contini

53:58.818 --> 54:02.947
Number-one genius
And number-one fan

54:03.114 --> 54:06.992
Guido Contini, Luisa Contini

54:07.160 --> 54:10.788
Passionate woman
In love with this man

54:10.956 --> 54:14.124
Long ago

54:15.961 --> 54:18.796
Many years ago

54:20.006 --> 54:26.512
Once we two were Guido Contini
Luisa, his lover

54:26.680 --> 54:30.641
Actress with dreams
And a life of her own

54:30.809 --> 54:34.520
Then we had no end
Of worlds to discover

54:34.688 --> 54:38.190
Singing together all night
On the phone

54:38.358 --> 54:41.360
Long ago

54:42.696 --> 54:45.489
Someone else ago

54:53.999 --> 54:55.332
Luisa Acari.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.002
Your name is Italian.

54:58.169 --> 55:00.212
My father's Italian.

55:00.380 --> 55:01.880
My mother's French.

55:02.048 --> 55:03.674
What have you done before?

55:03.842 --> 55:05.634
I've waited.

55:05.802 --> 55:07.678
Waited for this?

55:10.473 --> 55:12.599
Waited tables.

55:13.351 --> 55:17.229
And of course I studied theater
and mime in Paris.

55:18.398 --> 55:21.567
But mostly waited tables.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.378
Thank you.

55:41.546 --> 55:43.130
For what?

55:43.423 --> 55:45.841
Thank you for what I'm looking at.

55:47.218 --> 55:49.261
Keep running it.

55:51.264 --> 55:55.392
Long ago

55:56.728 --> 56:00.105
Someone else ago

56:01.191 --> 56:04.234
How he needs me so

56:05.070 --> 56:11.909
And he'II be the last to know it

56:13.536 --> 56:18.457
My husband makes movies

56:18.625 --> 56:23.295
To make them
He makes himself obsessed

56:23.463 --> 56:28.634
He works for weeks on end
Without a bit of rest

56:29.260 --> 56:34.014
No other way can he achieve
His level best

56:35.475 --> 56:37.476
Some men read books

56:37.769 --> 56:40.145
Some shine their shoes

56:40.313 --> 56:42.064
Some retire early

56:42.232 --> 56:45.109
Some stay out to dream and muse

56:45.276 --> 56:50.114
My husband only rarely
Comes to bed

56:51.741 --> 56:57.162
My husband makes movies instead

57:03.795 --> 57:06.713
My husband

57:07.674 --> 57:11.844
Makes movies

57:26.568 --> 57:30.654
Excuse me,
I suddenly feel very tired.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.701
What happened?

57:38.538 --> 57:40.122
Luisa.

57:41.458 --> 57:45.127
I'm staggered by my own stupidity.
I could vomit.

57:45.295 --> 57:48.714
Luisa, would you please just tell me
what happened?

57:48.882 --> 57:51.467
You open your mouth
and a lie comes out.

57:51.634 --> 57:52.885
What lie?

57:53.052 --> 57:55.345
Why am I surprised?

57:55.513 --> 57:58.265
It's like breathing to you.

58:10.945 --> 58:11.987
Guido.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.534
I was hungry.

58:17.702 --> 58:21.121
- I'm tired of eating alone in that room.
- There are plenty of restaurants.

58:21.289 --> 58:22.498
I wanted to see the hotel.

58:22.665 --> 58:25.334
I told you I came here with my parents
when I was little.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.337
- I didn't come to disturb you.
- You certainly managed to.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.589
Why didn't you tell me
Luisa would be here?

58:30.757 --> 58:33.509
I didn't know she was here.
She just turned up.

58:33.676 --> 58:35.093
She could have warned you.

58:35.261 --> 58:39.640
The only privilege my wife has
these days is not having to warn me.

58:41.017 --> 58:44.603
- A taxi, please, for the signora.
- Right away.

58:44.771 --> 58:47.648
Carla, you have to wait outside.

58:47.815 --> 58:49.358
Will you wait with me?

58:49.526 --> 58:52.778
I'm in the middle of a working dinner
with my colleagues.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.697
So why do I have to wait outside?

58:57.116 --> 58:59.952
I'll find someone
to escort you home.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.128
Signora.

59:10.296 --> 59:12.464
Would you rather wait inside?

59:14.801 --> 59:18.512
I'm going to walk.
Please tell my friend I had to leave.

59:52.755 --> 59:56.717
Apparently she's staying in some
grotesque pensione...

59:56.884 --> 59:58.510
...next to the station.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.180
Luisa?

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:07.185
If I'd invited her here, she'd be staying
in the hotel, wouldn't she?

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.354
I mean, think about it.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.523
I didn't even know you were coming.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.568
- Very plausible.
- Because it's true.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.868
You told me it was finished.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.079
It is. She was worried,
she came to see if I was all right...

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:29.207
...which, yes, is stupid.
It's not, as far as I know, a crime.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.501
And hardly a mortal sin. What?

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.129
What are you laughing about?

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.674
Nothing.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.428
If you could see yourself...

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.098
I couldn't live with it...

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:48.393
...the absurdity of being you...

01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:53.899
...the effort of having to hide and lie
and cheat.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.234
It's exhausting.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.571
No wonder you've got no script.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.407
You're too busy inventing
your own life.

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:07.079
It's finished.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.414
If it wasn't before, it is now.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:12.084
Blah, blah, blah.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.281
- Vodka.
- I'll have one of those.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:48.412
Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie
from Vogue. Remember me?

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:50.622
Yes, I remember very well.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.291
Stephanina from Vogue.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.795
So coincidence,
you being here and me being here.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.297
Amazing. May I take a cigarette?

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.258
That was quite the performance.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.385
At the press conference.
The vanishing act.

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:08.473
Oh, no, please. Please, my treat.

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.892
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.816
- I've seen all your movies.
- Really?

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.611
Like...

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.322
...a million times.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.201
They're the only movies that
tell the truth about the world.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.245
What truth is that?

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:31.747
The death of religion.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.999
The sexual revolution.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.669
I don't think religion is dead.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.921
And what exactly
is the sexual revolution?

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:43.842
That we can talk about later.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.678
You have such style.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.099
I always think that. That's the other
thing I love about your movies.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.476
Style.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:55.353
Every frame, it's like a postcard.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.522
- Okay.
- It's great.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.026
You care as much about the suit
as the man wearing it.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:05.238
It's the Italian man in you,
pays for the drinks...

01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:07.699
...undresses you with his eyes.

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:09.201
I hate that man.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:13.163
No. Style is the new content.
It's what my readers love.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.332
They wanna dress like
Claudia Jenssen.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.042
Undress like Claudia Jenssen.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.712
They wanna ride on a Vespa
down the Via Veneto.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.714
They wanna live in an Italian movie.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.677
I love the black and white

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.721
I love the play of light

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.058
The way Contini puts his image
Through a prism

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:35.811
I feel my body chill

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:37.813
Gives me a special thrill

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.399
Each time I see that
Guido neo-realism

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:44.152
I love the dark and handsome guys
With their skinny little ties

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.404
Dressin' mod and lookin' outta sight

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:48.323
I love to watch 'em as they cruise
With their pointy leather shoes

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.075
Wearin' shades
In the middle of the night

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.369
Whatever Guido does
It makes me smile

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.162
He is the essence of Italian style

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.707
I love the glamorously Latin world
That only Guido can portray

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:01.127
Contini's Cinema Italiano

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:05.423
I love his Cinema Italiano

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.176
He makes me feel
With Cinema Italiano

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.095
My life is real with Cinema Italiano

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.681
He is the king of Cinema Italiano

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:25.861
Those scenes I love to see
From Guido's POV

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:29.781
There's no one else with
His unique director's vision

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:33.702
His angles, wide and tight
Each moment feels so right

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:37.414
Defines Italian style
By only his decision

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.458
I love the speedy little cars
The hip coffee bars

01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:43.670
The sleek women in Positano

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:49.634
Guido's the ultimate uomo Romano

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:53.722
Contini's Cinema Italiano

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.601
I love his Cinema Italiano

01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:04.149
Guido, Guido, Guido

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:08.904
Guido, Guido

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.504
Dark and handsome guys
Skinny little ties

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.423
Shades in the middle of the night

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.425
Speedy little cars
Hip coffee bars

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:36.097
Sleek women in Positano

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:24.104
Contini's Cinema

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:25.730
Italiano

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.461
No.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.120
I love you, Luisa.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:36.134
Can we please try
to be close again?

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.722
That's...

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:08.458
- Is the doctor still with her?
- Yeah, he's in there.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.002
He's waiting for you. This way.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.682
- You came.
- I'm here.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.978
Signor Contini.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.984
Come back.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:47.455
She took five or six pills,
enough to make herself very sick.

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:50.457
I understand she's your mistress.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.127
This is a sordid business.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.380
You movie people.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:59.716
I suppose you don't consider yourself
bound by morality.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.152
Guido?

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.488
Where are you running to?

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.330
Thank you.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.332
I'm going to stay with her now.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.752
If you need us for anything,
just call, okay?

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.265
Carla.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.435
I should call your husband.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:54.731
No. He'll take me home.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.442
What have you done to yourself?

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.403
I'm not worth dying for, Carla.

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.447
Don't be angry with me.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:08.286
Everything I do,
I just want you to love me.

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:12.207
When you're not here with me...

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.292
...I am still here.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.046
When you are in your life, making
your movies, dancing with your wife...

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.089
...I'm still here.

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.137
You should rest now.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.183
We'II talk about everything
in the morning.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.697
Don't leave me.

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:49.953
- Don't leave me.
- Rest, rest, cara mia.

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:04.759
How the moon glows
As it smiles over you

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.845
When you're dreaming

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:10.014
Blissfully

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.934
Dreaming

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.520
Flying free

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.985
My husband thinks I'm clever.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:25.989
It's a strange thing because I'm not.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.658
Well, you know that.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:33.830
I spend too much time in
my little brain, thinking about you.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.375
About where you are,
what you're doing...

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.377
...what you dream of.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:45.383
Oh, dream of your youth
When I'm still by your side

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:50.388
Dream of your manhood
Pray I'm there to guide you

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:55.226
And when you grow old
How my love still will shine

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.813
Always remember, my son

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.816
You will always be mine

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.319
Yes, mine

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:16.581
Guido

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:22.337
Do you think that
So many will love you

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.006
As I do?

01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:35.600
She hangs in the sky

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:40.772
Beaming her blessing
To make you and I know that

01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:45.902
This one good-night kiss

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:50.448
Will keep all your life

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:59.040
Perfect like this

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.837
Hold on to me, Mama.

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:08.091
Don't let me wake from this.

01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:25.983
Excuse me.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:37.912
Is she okay?

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.998
Yes.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:44.252
I'd like to take her home.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.586
Of course.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.465
I'm sorry.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.178
She loves you.
You know that, don't you?

01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.098
She's my wife.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.796
Darling?

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.300
We're going back to Rome.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.636
- Where's Luisa?
- Luisa? She's gone.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:39.056
She's had it with you.
And quite frankly, so have I.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:42.393
You drag a whole crew up here
and then you just disappear.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.813
I can't protect you anymore.
And Claudia's in Rome.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:49.233
- Makeup tests start today. Remember?
- I can't.

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:51.652
You can't. You must. Don't sit down.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.071
- I need help.
- You've had help.

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:57.200
You've seen the doctors,
the priests, you've taken the cure.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:14:58.409
I'm not cured.

01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:02.413
That's enough. The movie calls.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:03.956
Your star has landed.

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:06.584
Fausto, take his things, please.

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:11.255
- I need more time.
- Forget the script.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:14.550
Claudia's here now. She'II inspire you
to do what you do best:

01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:16.761
Write with your camera.

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:25.895
Maestro, screen tests are back from
the lab. Will you watch them now?

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.315
Tonight. We'll watch everything
tonight and make some decisions.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.817
- Design meeting? Production meeting?
- Tonight.

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:33.694
Tonight.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.988
Claudia says where are you?

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:38.950
- She's in fine form. Feisty.
- Okay.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:41.953
She asked if she could read my script
as she didn't have one.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.580
I said I didn't quite have mine.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.923
Tell everyone
the screening is tonight.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:55.967
Ready?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.140
Luisa, it's me.

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:04.976
Please don't hang up.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:10.064
I want you to be with me
in the screening room tonight.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.276
To talk to you about the casting.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:16.445
About the script, everything.

01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:22.493
Otherwise, I won't be able to start.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:26.289
I won't know what I'm thinking.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:30.001
Maestro.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:34.088
Are you there, Luisa?

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:37.842
Go on.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:41.220
I'm not asking you
to let me come home.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:45.433
I just want you to come
to the screen test tonight.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.185
Not for me, but for the movie.

01:16:48.353 --> 01:16:50.354
You always have.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.190
You always do.

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:18.007
Okay, silence, please.

01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:21.469
And we are rolling.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:31.812
Would you turn to the right,
please, Claudia?

01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:35.733
Yes. I can turn to my right.

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:39.236
And can you turn to the left?

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.822
I can turn to my left.

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:48.537
Now just one slow turn for us.

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:53.876
Okay, one slow turn.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.714
Cut.

01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:02.093
We've got it. Next costume, please.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.596
Has anybody got a script?
Script missing.

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.182
Handsome reward.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.060
Lost, one script. Title, Italia.

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:12.770
Can't make a film without it.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.940
So interesting to do hair
and makeup for a part...

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:18.275
...when you don't know
what the part is.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.947
No.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.949
I'm going back to my hotel now.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.951
Please, just a couple
more costumes.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.537
I'm going back to my hotel,
my darling...

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.039
...and when there is a script,
I will read it...

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.792
...and then we can take it
from there.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:38.462
I love the costumes, Lilli.
They are beautiful.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:40.297
That's fair.

01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:42.216
- Claudia.
- That's fair.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.135
- Fair?
- I'll be back.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:47.221
- You've got dailies. Meetings.
- I'll be right back.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.164
You look ravishing.

01:19:13.665 --> 01:19:16.917
You're not seeing me,
you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.086
I'm somewhere hidden underneath.

01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:47.448
It's good to see you.

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:52.870
I'm assuming that's code for,
"There's no script."

01:19:55.791 --> 01:20:01.378
Why is everybody so suddenly
obsessed with the script?

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:06.550
Talk to the people
who love you in our films.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:09.470
They're not interested in my script.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.184
They're interested in the way
you turn your head.

01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:17.228
The way the camera looks past you
to the moon.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:19.230
The way you smile a little
as you cry.

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:23.609
The way you really do blush
for the camera. How?

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.738
Who even knows...

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:32.076
...but whatever else it is,
it's not my script.

01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:48.342
So Lilli says I'm playing
a million different parts.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:51.804
Not a million.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.266
You're the muses...

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:59.270
...the incredible women that made Italy
what it is today.

01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:01.897
A country run by men...

01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:05.109
...who are themselves
run by women.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.695
Whether they know it or not.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:11.031
So I am the women
behind the great men?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.533
The great women.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.618
In a way, yes.

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:19.123
You have this man in the story
and he's...

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.130
He wants to take hold of everything,
to devour everything.

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:31.468
He can't let anything go
or he doesn't want to.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.224
But he changes direction every day
because he's lost, he's dying.

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.519
He's bleeding to death.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:45.107
These muses,
they fall in love with the man?

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:47.151
Exactly.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:49.987
They fall in love with him.

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.656
I'd rather be the man.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:54.199
What?

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:56.911
I'd rather be the man.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:06.587
In a very unusual way

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:11.175
One time I needed you

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:16.430
In a very unusual way

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.850
You were my friend

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:26.857
Maybe it lasted a day

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:31.654
Maybe it lasted an hour

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:39.787
But somehow it will never end

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:45.250
These women who come off their
pedestals for a kiss, they are...

01:22:45.418 --> 01:22:47.670
They're just fantasies.

01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:48.879
No, you misunderstand.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:52.800
In a very unusual way

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.845
I think I'm in love with you

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:02.393
In a very unusual way

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.853
I want to cry

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:12.152
Something inside me goes weak

01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:17.241
Something inside me surrenders

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:22.413
And you're the reason why

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:28.836
You're the reason why

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:33.257
You don't know what you do to me

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:36.510
You don't have a clue

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:41.598
You can't tell what it's like

01:23:41.766 --> 01:23:45.936
To be me looking at you

01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:49.606
It scares me so

01:23:49.774 --> 01:23:53.694
That I can hardly speak

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.155
She's his inspiration.

01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:59.658
I can't keep playing that part.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.995
And I fall in love with you
every time.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:07.291
When there's a camera between us.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.209
No.

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:14.465
It's not a real person, Guido.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.342
And this man you describe...

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.429
...he doesn't know how to love.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:25.809
In a very unusual way

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:29.146
I owe what I am to you

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:32.483
There was a time once,
we were on location...

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.319
...some terrible hotel.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.697
You were in the room
directly above me.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:42.367
I could hear you walking about.

01:24:42.535 --> 01:24:46.413
And all through the night,
I wanted to rush up the stairs...

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.999
...and hammer on your door
until you opened.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:51.460
And why didn't you?

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:56.757
I don't know.

01:24:56.925 --> 01:25:01.095
Special to me in my life

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:05.849
Since the first day that I met you

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:09.436
How could I ever forget you

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:15.442
Once you had touched my soul?

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:25.285
In a very unusual way

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:32.709
You've made

01:25:33.753 --> 01:25:37.548
Me

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:43.720
Whole

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.473
Maybe you should have knocked.

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:52.896
Maybe you should have knocked me
right off the pedestal.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:56.066
I can't do this anymore.

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.532
This is me.

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:07.661
And you have a wife who loves you.

01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:13.125
I'll miss you.

01:26:16.754 --> 01:26:18.463
Wrong girl.

01:26:38.818 --> 01:26:42.946
- Great work, Lilli. Wonderful costume.
- Thank you.

01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:45.240
And the hair and makeup is perfect.

01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:47.576
- She has a beautiful profile.
- Yeah.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.077
Two great profiles.

01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:52.122
- She's a goddess.
- And the back isn't too bad too.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.083
She came directly from Venus.
Beautiful.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.712
Yeah. Fantastic, eh, Guido?

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.631
Really nice. Who's next?

01:27:00.798 --> 01:27:02.716
- Actresses.
- Okay.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:03.967
Let's see the actresses.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.891
If we like her, we have
to call her agent right away.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:14.394
- Everybody wants her right now.
- Well, they can keep her.

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.690
Now go and sit down there.

01:27:18.858 --> 01:27:22.152
- She's a very funny actress.
- Funny peculiar.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.029
Perfect.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:27.157
You don't like her, do you?
Eh, Guido?

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.827
My name is Ilaria.

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:32.246
I like her.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:34.957
Who asked you?
Now mind your business.

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:36.667
Why didn't you call me?

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.547
Thank you.

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.008
Donatella.

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:47.427
- Donatella Valentini.
- Valentini?

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:52.015
Go and look at yourself in the mirror,
whatever you feel like doing is fine.

01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:55.394
No, just walk normally.
You don't have to flounce around.

01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:58.522
Forget that I'm here.
There's nobody else in the room.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.065
She's nice.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:04.528
Who's the person you would
most like to call tonight?

01:28:05.905 --> 01:28:06.947
Darling.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.033
First you have to dial the number,
sweetheart.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.495
She's very natural.

01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:16.790
She's even better.
She's a bit nervous here.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:20.585
What do you think, Guido?
Donatella's nice, huh?

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.048
- Who is this?
- Piovan.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.593
- Would you start by saying your name?
- He said he wanted a blond.

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:30.846
Hi. I'm Alessia.

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.181
- Piovan?
- From the North.

01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:35.309
From the North.
Where exactly are you from?

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.394
- Padua.
- Padua.

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:39.521
- She's too tall.
- Okay.

01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:41.773
- Yeah, very tall.
- See you there.

01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:44.276
Bye. Bye-bye.

01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:48.155
- She's really beautiful.
- She's really very nice.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.991
- Not the point. Guido wants the blond.
- Very nice, simple.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.243
It's just what I like.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.637
Thank you.

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:16.099
Thank you for looking like this.

01:29:18.644 --> 01:29:20.103
Perfect.

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:22.522
- She's beautiful.
- She's too beautiful.

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.358
- Cut.
- For my taste.

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:27.402
I know what Guido thinks.
I think we are happy with Donatella.

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.072
Donatella's better, isn't she?

01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:32.532
- Sure.
- Well, great.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.078
Anyway, fantastic day,
but we have to go home.

01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:38.914
We have a very,
very busy day tomorrow.

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:42.084
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you. Okay, well done.

01:29:42.251 --> 01:29:44.252
Some of these actors need
to be booked right away.

01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:58.600
It meant so much to us all
that you came.

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:03.980
What did you think?
Did you like anybody? Or?

01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:11.321
Luisa?

01:30:25.294 --> 01:30:27.796
You want my love?

01:30:28.214 --> 01:30:30.048
Take it all

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:33.552
You wanna watch it all come off?

01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:35.095
Take it all

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:37.806
Come on now

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:40.517
Show me how

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.770
You take it all

01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:46.815
Thank you.

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:48.358
What for?

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:50.986
Thank you for reminding me
I'm not special.

01:30:52.822 --> 01:30:55.449
You don't even see what you do,
do you?

01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:59.870
Even the moments
I think are ours, it's just...

01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:03.915
...you working to get what you want.

01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:08.003
You want my glove?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:09.588
Are you enthralled?

01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:15.051
You wanna see it slip away
And watch it fall?

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:18.221
Oh, we know

01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:20.432
It's your show

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.766
So take it all

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:26.563
What are you talking about?

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.857
The screen test?

01:31:32.528 --> 01:31:35.780
You have to understand,
it's nothing.

01:31:35.948 --> 01:31:37.532
This is what I do, I direct.

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.494
- That's my job.
- And this is our life.

01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:45.624
You think to create is to
forgive yourself in public. Fine.

01:31:45.791 --> 01:31:49.628
But don't think I can forgive you
in private, because I can't.

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:52.964
Ever.

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:55.675
So go ahead

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.802
Take it all

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:01.056
You want my soul?

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:03.391
Take it all

01:32:03.559 --> 01:32:06.144
It's time to leave

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:08.438
If I'm to live

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:14.236
Because I have no more
There's nothing left to give

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.848
I watch you rise

01:32:44.016 --> 01:32:46.101
I watch you fall

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:51.606
While I am standing with my back
Against the wall

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.776
Now it's your turn

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:57.445
To finally learn

01:32:57.613 --> 01:32:59.990
You had the world
You had your fling

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:02.742
You wanted more than everything

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.537
You got your wish
You got your prize

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:08.039
Now take it right
Between your thighs

01:33:08.207 --> 01:33:10.417
You grabbed for everything
My friend

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.877
But don't you see that in the end

01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:14.796
There will be nothing

01:33:16.632 --> 01:33:19.509
You're just an appetite...

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.430
...and if you stopped being greedy,
you'd die.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:26.182
You take everything.

01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:29.269
And I'm empty.

01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:43.700
You know, I'm glad I came.

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:48.204
I can see now it's hopeless.

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:23.657
What have I done?

01:34:28.079 --> 01:34:30.830
What have I done, Luisa?

01:34:35.586 --> 01:34:38.171
I can't make this movie.

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.924
There's no way that I'll begin it.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.928
I can't bear to see the cameras roll.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:49.808
Problem is the subject,
there's no pleasant way to treat it.

01:34:49.975 --> 01:34:53.978
The problem is
The author's lost control

01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:57.774
How I wish it didn't have to be so

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:01.736
But we cut the losses starting now

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:05.865
Strike the set and keep it
For some sideshow

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:09.744
Tell the cast and crew
That they can all go

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:19.087
Find another genius
I can't be one or become one

01:35:19.255 --> 01:35:21.589
I can't even tell how I'd begin

01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:25.635
Help, Luisa, help me
Help me, Mama, help me someone

01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:28.888
Here's a place
Where I have never been

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:32.600
Guido out in space
With no direction

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:36.020
Guido at a loss for what to say

01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:39.190
Guido with no intervening actors

01:35:39.358 --> 01:35:41.776
Guido at the mercy of detractors

01:35:41.944 --> 01:35:44.112
Guido here with no one else but...

01:35:50.494 --> 01:35:53.663
Nothing holds together
Nothing makes a bit of sense now

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:56.958
Impossible to grasp or understand

01:35:57.293 --> 01:36:00.712
How can I go on to watch
The whole of my existence

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.798
End up being nothing
That I planned?

01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:07.343
Have I lost myself
And all I wished for?

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.305
Has my life become
A mindless game?

01:36:11.056 --> 01:36:13.808
Guido
I can't stand the name of Guido

01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:16.019
Guido
For God's sake, who is this Guido?

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:18.021
Guido here with no one else but

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:20.899
Guido!

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.292
I destroyed everything, Mama.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.925
I destroyed everything.
But I've just...

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:51.930
You make one wrong turn,
and then because of that, after it...

01:36:52.097 --> 01:36:54.224
...all the turns are wrong.

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:59.395
And you are so far from where
you wanted to be and you're lost.

01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:04.192
And then you're lost.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:09.823
No one can help you find your way.

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.701
It's up to you, Guido.

01:37:13.869 --> 01:37:15.745
Up to you.

01:37:16.413 --> 01:37:18.623
Nobody else.

01:37:38.727 --> 01:37:40.603
Old friends, I have to...

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.981
...come clean with you.

01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:46.693
There is no movie.

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:50.196
I can't pretend anymore.

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:57.412
We have to stop.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.958
I'm sorry.

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.831
Luisa, let's go.

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:27.937
I'm glad she's acting again.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:31.149
I made her costumes for the play.
She's funny.

01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:33.067
She seemed so happy.

01:40:33.235 --> 01:40:34.986
I didn't want to interfere.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:39.323
Is she with anybody, Lilli?

01:40:39.491 --> 01:40:41.075
Guido.

01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:44.787
She's my friend. I'm not her mother.
I don't know. I expect so.

01:40:44.955 --> 01:40:47.165
Nobody likes to be alone.

01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:53.212
Promise me you're gonna let me cut
your hair, get rid of that awful beard.

01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:57.508
I like to get about without
everybody pointing at me.

01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:01.262
And where are you getting about?

01:41:02.014 --> 01:41:04.390
Nowhere. Here.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.186
I walk just to be able to walk.

01:41:09.688 --> 01:41:11.439
Are you seeing anybody?

01:41:11.607 --> 01:41:13.066
No.

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:16.486
No. Nobody.

01:41:17.279 --> 01:41:18.696
Well, it sounds exciting.

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:21.699
Walking around and not seeing
anyone and growing a beard.

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:25.495
- I might come up here and join you.
- Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is...

01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:27.872
- I know.
- I just miss her.

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.334
I should have "idiot"
tattooed on my forehead.

01:41:32.294 --> 01:41:34.504
Luisa certainly thinks so.

01:41:34.671 --> 01:41:37.632
Does she? Did she really say that?

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.886
Stop. I'm not going to act
as a postman between you both.

01:41:43.972 --> 01:41:45.973
Come back to Rome.

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:48.643
Make a movie. Go to work.

01:41:48.811 --> 01:41:50.186
No.

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:51.938
Never.

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:56.651
I've spent this time
trying to learn something, Lilli.

01:41:56.985 --> 01:42:01.781
Not be the person that forgets about
everybody else.

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.367
The person who never grew up.

01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:08.871
You're such a dope, aren't you?

01:42:09.039 --> 01:42:10.873
Making movies,
it wasn't your problem.

01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:12.959
You were the problem.

01:42:14.002 --> 01:42:17.380
Don't stop being a child,
you'II never make another movie.

01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:20.550
No one wants that, especially Luisa.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:23.469
Guido...

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:27.181
...there probably isn't a single person
passing by...

01:42:27.349 --> 01:42:31.269
...who hasn't been touched
in some way by one of your movies.

01:42:31.436 --> 01:42:34.230
That's your gift.
It's what you've been given.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:36.899
Use it.

01:42:37.067 --> 01:42:41.028
Just use it with some grace,
for chrissake.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:48.578
The only movie I could
make now would...

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.455
I don't know.

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:56.711
It would be about a man
trying to win back his wife.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.923
Sounds perfect.

01:43:01.633 --> 01:43:04.802
The costumes might
not be so bad too.

01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:25.698
We're ready to begin.

01:44:22.714 --> 01:44:24.882
I can't remember how you do this.

01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:27.051
Oh, you'll remember.

01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:34.642
I don't want to say too much.

01:44:35.227 --> 01:44:39.689
The first way that we kill our film
is by talking about it...

01:44:39.856 --> 01:44:42.483
...but this scene is
about reconciliation.

01:44:43.193 --> 01:44:46.737
And within the scene, I would like you
to try to find your way...

01:44:46.905 --> 01:44:49.657
...to begin that journey
back towards each other.

01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:51.242
Take your places!

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:55.746
Maybe it's the most important building
block that we have, to begin again.

01:44:55.914 --> 01:44:57.832
Start from the beginning
each time...

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.003
...and I feel today as if I'm starting
from the beginning.

01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:05.756
We'II just keep asking
each other questions.

01:45:05.924 --> 01:45:08.884
And don't look to me
for the answers.

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:11.095
- Okay?
- We'll do our best.

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:14.890
- Maestro, should I call final checks?
- Yes. Yes, please.

01:45:15.058 --> 01:45:16.767
I'd like to try your hair back.

01:45:16.935 --> 01:45:19.395
Makeup, please! Final checks!

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:23.232
Could you put her hair
in a ponytail, please? Thanks.

01:45:39.082 --> 01:45:40.666
This one.

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:44.503
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:46:53.198 --> 01:46:55.408
Silence, please!

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:15.010
Slate.
