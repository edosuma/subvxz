01:27.944 --> 01:30.907
well, well, Bart Simpson in trouble again.

01:31.151 --> 01:32.982
School hasn't even started yet.

01:33.238 --> 01:34.212
What can I say?

01:34.298 --> 01:35.429
I missed you, Myra.

01:35.519 --> 01:36.516
How's things with you and Frank?

01:36.577 --> 01:37.456
That bum!

01:37.541 --> 01:40.184
He says his divorce will be final next week.

01:40.246 --> 01:42.153
So why is she pregnant again?

01:42.201 --> 01:44.532
You hang in there, beautiful.

01:45.190 --> 01:46.026
So, where's the skin-man

01:46.180 --> 01:48.402
he's out admiring his new car.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.073
Ah, 1995.

01:51.643 --> 01:53.367
A fine year for Camrys.

01:53.466 --> 01:56.185
No one would ever guess you 
spent three months in a lake.

02:02.384 --> 02:03.840
Ay, caramba!

02:06.086 --> 02:08.049
Thank you, satan.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.875
Just think, Milhouse. From now on we'll always

02:16.912 --> 02:18.998
be "those kids who got into 
the steam tunnels."

02:27.561 --> 02:30.324
Now I gotta warn you we could get in trouble.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.370
I don't mind!

02:31.428 --> 02:33.075
Trouble's a form of attention.

02:36.202 --> 02:38.138
Gentlemen, the moment has 
finally arrived.

02:38.443 --> 02:41.871
I'm rentin' a party bus and takin' 
all you regulars to Las Vegas.

02:42.063 --> 02:42.902
Nevada?!

02:42.926 --> 02:43.803
That's right.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.035
Moe, why you bein' so generous?

02:47.083 --> 02:49.492
You're usually so stingy and rat-like.

02:49.695 --> 02:50.965
Yeah, well, you remember that time

02:51.002 --> 02:53.055
I tried to hang myself and the rope broke?

02:53.113 --> 02:56.011
Well, I sued the rope company 
and I got a huge settlement....

02:56.085 --> 02:56.899
and a new rope!

02:57.915 --> 02:58.778
Hey, nice rope.

02:58.877 --> 03:00.591
You could hang a cow with that thing!

03:02.067 --> 03:04.580
These steam tunnels are awesome.

03:04.756 --> 03:08.934
It's like we're in the school's 
lymphatic system and we're the lymph.

03:09.986 --> 03:11.392
Oh, my god!

03:11.638 --> 03:13.845
My dad had a long talk with me about this,

03:13.907 --> 03:16.272
but you can't believe it till you see it!

03:16.408 --> 03:18.208
The cafeteria loading dock!

03:18.245 --> 03:19.762
Look we're having pizza tomorrow!

03:19.812 --> 03:21.501
I'm gonna eat a lighter breakfast.

03:24.876 --> 03:27.063
well, we made it to the valve room.

03:27.102 --> 03:29.131
Now we can leave without touching a valve.

03:29.282 --> 03:31.095
What a tale that'll be.

03:31.204 --> 03:34.473
Hey, we can't leave here without 
turning one little valve.

03:34.535 --> 03:36.817
Yeah, it'd be like going to Amsterdam

03:36.866 --> 03:39.369
and not taking a walking tour of famous doors.

03:54.479 --> 03:57.114
That's odd, we only turn the 
heat on for parents' night.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.049
What the F-minus?

04:06.315 --> 04:08.942
Steeeaam!

04:09.067 --> 04:13.358
Grover cleveland's second term was, 
if anything, more uneventful...

04:16.519 --> 04:17.870
Look, a new kid!

04:17.974 --> 04:18.601
Get him!

04:38.877 --> 04:40.645
Our instruments are rusting!

04:40.844 --> 04:43.268
We're going a cappella, people!

04:53.719 --> 04:56.033
I've got two kinds of wet in my pants!

05:00.153 --> 05:01.880
God, it's so hot...

05:01.992 --> 05:02.929
I need a drink.

05:06.731 --> 05:09.033
No water fountain outwits Willie!

05:11.267 --> 05:12.756
Maybe I'll just have a soda.

05:21.416 --> 05:24.319
This wood is more buckled than a pilgrim's hat.

05:24.635 --> 05:26.815
But who's responsible?

05:29.646 --> 05:33.437
Don't bother struggling, I've got your scruff.

05:33.493 --> 05:34.677
Can I cut a deal?

05:34.777 --> 05:35.929
I'll give you Milhouse.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.405
I don't want Milhouse.

05:38.474 --> 05:41.184
Sounds like my parents' custody hearing.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.773
Myra, can ya help me out here?

05:46.810 --> 05:47.538
Forget it.

05:47.612 --> 05:49.538
This used to be a croissandwich.

05:49.572 --> 05:52.145
Now, it's a ham and cheese car crash.

05:52.228 --> 05:53.642
Yes, thank you, Myra.

05:53.861 --> 05:56.729
To highlight the seriousness of Bart's offense,

05:56.774 --> 06:00.153
superintendent chalmers will 
be joining us by video uplink.

06:00.178 --> 06:04.447
And joining me by video uplink, 
state comptroller Atkins.

06:04.471 --> 06:06.210
Can we move this along?

06:06.247 --> 06:08.877
I'm attending an important 
conference here in Scottsdale.

06:09.047 --> 06:10.021
You're in Scottsdale?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.353
I'm in Scottsdale!

06:11.398 --> 06:13.272
At the Hyatt room 381!

06:13.334 --> 06:13.943
Get outta here!

06:13.968 --> 06:15.373
I'm in 502!

06:15.849 --> 06:18.007
Hey, do you guys have any ice buckets down there?

06:18.167 --> 06:20.261
No, we've been using shower caps.

06:20.596 --> 06:21.995
Skinner!

06:24.008 --> 06:26.871
You made that tv show really mad.

06:26.899 --> 06:29.821
Yes, well you won't think it's 
so funny when we send Bart here.

06:31.106 --> 06:32.204
"Upward bound:

06:32.324 --> 06:36.936
"The toughest behavioral modification 
camp in northwest Oregon."

06:36.998 --> 06:39.563
It's the only place cruel 
enough to straighten Bart out.

06:39.748 --> 06:41.839
They use a proven concept "tough hate"

06:41.987 --> 06:44.034
to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.811
Then they send them home, quietly ticking away.

06:49.470 --> 06:50.987
This camp's got it all.

06:51.176 --> 06:52.898
Climbing some kind of rope thing.

06:53.148 --> 06:56.126
Wearing a backpack. High-fiving the black kid.

06:56.494 --> 06:58.852
It's the perfect thing to straighten you out.

07:00.447 --> 07:01.285
Got it.

07:04.905 --> 07:08.185
Now I have a ring tone for 
my brand-new cell phone.

07:08.327 --> 07:09.837
No wires at all.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.268
Except this one.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.240
Hey,  check it out.

07:19.265 --> 07:20.858
I made it partially risquÃ©.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.377
Hey, guys, I have to put the boy

07:24.474 --> 07:26.102
on a plane to soul-crushing camp.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.680
Then I'll be back to go to Vegas.

07:27.732 --> 07:29.360
Dad, if you take me to Vegas,

07:29.434 --> 07:30.828
I'll  teach you how to cheat at blackjack.

07:30.889 --> 07:33.612
Boy, you don't need to cheat
when you got a system.

07:33.681 --> 07:34.541
What's your system?

07:34.593 --> 07:37.841
I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.133
One child to Portland.

07:43.866 --> 07:45.679
He's your problem now.

07:46.784 --> 07:48.852
It seems he was our problem before.

07:50.876 --> 07:52.726
You son is on the "no fly" list.

07:53.437 --> 07:55.531
Why, there must be some mistake.

07:55.565 --> 07:56.700
There's no mistake.

07:56.946 --> 07:59.615
It seems, the last time he flew unescorted...

08:00.301 --> 08:01.287
Welcome to Atlanta.

08:01.324 --> 08:03.121
Please keep your seat belt fastened

08:03.170 --> 08:04.716
until we have come to a complete stop.

08:06.026 --> 08:08.104
Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.

08:10.230 --> 08:12.326
Thanks a lot, 33C.

08:12.437 --> 08:15.683
Now we all have to go back to 
Minneapolis, and I'm very tired.

08:21.609 --> 08:24.388
Well, Homer, looks like I 
can't go to discipline camp.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.204
Which is too bad, 'cause I 
think this was the thing

08:27.253 --> 08:29.013
that would finally straighten me out.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.509
Oh, yeah? You're going to that camp

08:31.595 --> 08:34.308
'cause I'm going to drive you there.

08:34.442 --> 08:37.394
Yeah, that will be way more fun than Vegas.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.746
Dang. Homer ain't coming.

08:44.806 --> 08:46.645
And Nelson saw something funny.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.627
Stupid Bart makes me drive to Oregon,

09:15.747 --> 09:19.336
home of unspoiled forests, 
birthplace of Matt Groening.

09:19.408 --> 09:21.172
Dad, neither of us want to go.

09:21.199 --> 09:22.379
Why are you doing this?

09:22.426 --> 09:23.834
Where's the old carefree Homer

09:23.861 --> 09:25.041
who likes to cut loose?

09:25.071 --> 09:26.188
You mean fun Homer?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.878
I'm afraid serious Homer has him locked up

09:28.954 --> 09:31.114
till you're at your snooty torture camp.

09:31.755 --> 09:32.945
Fight back, fun Homer!

09:33.022 --> 09:34.181
Together we can win!

09:34.260 --> 09:35.732
It's no use.

09:37.830 --> 09:39.763
Come on, serious Homer!

09:39.833 --> 09:40.907
Let me out!

09:41.038 --> 09:44.315
We'll get a monkey drunk and 
push him down the stairs.

09:45.957 --> 09:48.597
I'll kill you the way I killed intellectual Homer!

09:55.042 --> 09:57.282
While the boys are gone, we'll sell all

09:57.323 --> 10:01.879
their useless junk, and replace 
it with knickknacks and curios.

10:01.908 --> 10:04.454
I already made up a yard sale sign.

10:04.619 --> 10:09.116
You know, your father saved every 
book report he ever wrote.

10:09.263 --> 10:11.475
And every one was stuart little.

10:13.945 --> 10:18.025
Not to mention this powerpoint 
demonstration he did just last week.

10:25.219 --> 10:27.420
My Malibu Stacy heads!

10:29.492 --> 10:31.579
Bart blamed this on the dog.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.927
I didn't pet him for weeks.

10:35.711 --> 10:37.851
I'm sorry I doubted you, boy.

10:42.952 --> 10:45.258
Come on, dad, we got a long way to go.

10:45.294 --> 10:47.058
You can't stay mad at me the whole time.

10:47.092 --> 10:48.730
Boy, if you were half as smart as

10:48.763 --> 10:50.871
you think you are, you'd clean up your act.

10:51.046 --> 10:53.623
Well, maybe pulling pranks 
is the only thing I'm good at.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.715
At least you have something you're good at.

10:55.927 --> 10:59.465
I'm 38 years old, driving a 
crappy car, with a son who

10:59.473 --> 11:02.384
doesn't respect me, and I'm 
one snickers pie away

11:02.437 --> 11:04.294
from losing my foot to diabetes.

11:04.513 --> 11:08.155
Mmm... snickers pie!

11:18.622 --> 11:21.178
So, I see you're also traveling with your son.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.024
What boy prison are you taking him to?

11:23.054 --> 11:24.964
Actually, Justin and I are going to the Oregon

11:24.985 --> 11:26.049
Shakespeare festival.

11:26.157 --> 11:27.972
Sir peter hall, himself, is directing.

11:28.116 --> 11:31.142
See, Bart? I told you things could be worse.

11:31.245 --> 11:34.010
I'm getting a sweatshirt 
with Shakespeare's face on it.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.984
Well, we better get back to the prius, son.

11:36.065 --> 11:37.953
Don't forget the menu for our scrapbook.

11:44.801 --> 11:45.667
Did you see that?

11:45.938 --> 11:47.952
They were eating melon for breakfast.

11:49.581 --> 11:50.562
Look at me!

11:50.753 --> 11:52.130
I use a napkin.

11:57.444 --> 12:02.568
Well, dad, we may not always get 
along, but we'll never be that lame.

12:02.645 --> 12:04.544
I bet they're from Massachusetts.

12:04.689 --> 12:07.173
You know, it's legal there 
for a guy to marry his son.

12:09.682 --> 12:11.310
Well, I guess it's tinkle time.

12:13.098 --> 12:16.708
Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare!

12:18.666 --> 12:21.755
So, here for a snack before 
they roll you back into the ocean?

12:21.851 --> 12:25.451
Yeah. I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special.

12:25.694 --> 12:27.562
But could you add a bacon nose?

12:27.997 --> 12:31.117
Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, 
five o'clock shadow

12:31.132 --> 12:33.344
made of bacon bits, and A... bacon body.

12:33.389 --> 12:35.393
How 'bout if I just shoved
a pig down your throat?

12:36.044 --> 12:36.972
I'm kidding.

12:37.285 --> 12:37.733
Fine!

12:37.888 --> 12:40.038
But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!

12:40.066 --> 12:40.995
No, he doesn't!

12:46.492 --> 12:48.360
You  know who would really like this place?

12:48.840 --> 12:51.247
Bart. Wait a minute.

12:51.536 --> 12:52.809
Where the hell is Bart?

12:55.739 --> 12:56.856
You little monster!

12:59.150 --> 13:00.548
show your face this minute!

13:04.999 --> 13:06.387
Bart, where are you?!

13:08.790 --> 13:12.077
Hey,  Stavros, there's a guy in your 
bathroom trying to dine-and-dash.

13:12.152 --> 13:14.333
What?! No one dashie-dine on Stavros!

13:16.949 --> 13:18.013
Why you little...

13:18.911 --> 13:19.819
I'm stuck!

13:20.703 --> 13:22.842
Someone's hitting my butt with something!

13:22.893 --> 13:24.083
Is frying pan!

13:28.407 --> 13:29.450
Leave your ass, Homer.

13:29.647 --> 13:30.648
Leave your ass.

13:33.858 --> 13:34.996
Let me get this straight.

13:35.151 --> 13:38.063
I get all of Bart's action 
figures, Homer's treasured

13:38.071 --> 13:41.233
Mr. Plow jacket, and these 
power ranger underoos,

13:41.255 --> 13:44.343
which I am already wearing, for only 3.95?

13:44.488 --> 13:45.323
That's right.

13:45.518 --> 13:48.054
Give me five minutes alone with 
your fridge, and you have a deal.

13:49.031 --> 13:50.137
Fine.

13:50.534 --> 13:52.507
We've only brought in $5.00.

13:52.569 --> 13:55.512
And that came from Mr. Flanders 
buying back his own stuff.

13:56.324 --> 13:58.223
My LP of dreamcoat?!

13:58.409 --> 14:01.414
How I love my coat of many colors

14:01.577 --> 14:05.250
it was red and yellow and green and brown

14:05.264 --> 14:08.394
and scarlet and black and ochre and peach

14:08.405 --> 14:10.884
and ruby and olive and violet and...

14:13.318 --> 14:16.239
and lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve

14:16.286 --> 14:19.322
and cream and crimson and silver and rose

14:19.350 --> 14:22.501
and azure and lemon and russet and gray and...

14:24.979 --> 14:28.005
and purple and white and pink and orange

14:28.038 --> 14:31.105
and red and yellow and green and brown

14:31.345 --> 14:34.121
scarlet and black and ochre and peach.

14:34.293 --> 14:37.163
My yard sale is a failure.

14:37.314 --> 14:40.142
I guess I'll have to give 
everything to the salvation army.

14:40.187 --> 14:40.782
We don't want it!

14:41.972 --> 14:43.756
Mm... dexonumb.

14:43.844 --> 14:45.044
Somnodoze.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.209
Percolax.

14:46.294 --> 14:47.139
Are these for sale?

14:47.287 --> 14:48.194
I guess.

14:48.223 --> 14:50.800
They're Homer's expired pain medications.

14:50.922 --> 14:52.466
I'm in a lot of pain.

14:52.572 --> 14:55.233
I'm, breaking in a new pair of flip flops,

14:55.419 --> 14:57.821
and my thong notch is on fire!

14:58.068 --> 14:58.579
How much?

14:59.599 --> 15:00.486
A dollar.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.200
Per pill, right?

15:03.017 --> 15:04.185
I'll take a dozen of each.

15:05.657 --> 15:06.857
Drugs in a bottle.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.557
I feel like Elvis Presley.

15:11.287 --> 15:15.096
This is so much safer than buying my 
illegal drugs at the playground.

15:15.221 --> 15:16.296
Bag or keister?

15:16.343 --> 15:17.241
Surprise me.

15:20.158 --> 15:21.598
I'll take all your estrogen.

15:21.769 --> 15:24.138
That's a female replacement hormone.

15:24.512 --> 15:26.276
It's for... a friend.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.426
Who's trapped in the body of another friend.

15:29.775 --> 15:30.664
So, Lenny,

15:30.698 --> 15:31.902
How's it goin' in Vegas?

15:32.062 --> 15:33.189
Pretty boring, I'll bet.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.943
Yeah, kinda.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.638
Can't talk now, Homer.

15:46.683 --> 15:49.594
I'm too satisfied in every way.

15:58.723 --> 16:00.706
I got you now, boy.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.520
Oh!  Boy!

16:18.740 --> 16:19.750
Push down on the bumper!

16:19.870 --> 16:22.110
Then I can back the car up and save myself.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.940
If I save you, what are you gonna do to me?

16:26.460 --> 16:29.620
Shower you with love, because this experience

16:29.780 --> 16:32.050
has taught me just how precious you are.

16:33.420 --> 16:34.140
I'll kill you!

16:34.330 --> 16:35.850
I'll kill your whole family!

16:36.250 --> 16:38.000
Kidding! I'm kidding!

16:38.000 --> 16:41.080
We can do that, we have a special friendship.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.290
I'm gonna double kill you!

16:43.510 --> 16:45.440
Then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.460
Then I'll dig you up and kill you again!

16:47.600 --> 16:49.700
That's the beauty of a shallow grave.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.760
You sweet little angel.

16:53.450 --> 16:56.270
I'm gonna rip your head off and spit down...

16:56.270 --> 16:59.090
your adorable little neck, because I want...

16:59.090 --> 17:01.680
to smash your little stupid head...

17:02.320 --> 17:03.370
But I love you.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.359
We'll go on a fishing trip.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.440
But first I'm gonna put you on a sawmill, 

17:08.599 --> 17:10.770
then punch your little face out!

17:10.849 --> 17:12.170
That's what I'm gonna do!

17:18.599 --> 17:21.960
I'm here for the, yard sale?

17:22.030 --> 17:23.240
That was yesterday.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.810
No, I mean the yard sale.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.420
What are you talking about?

17:28.660 --> 17:29.670
Can I buy some pills?

17:29.970 --> 17:32.320
Well, maybe someone else can help you, 

17:32.450 --> 17:34.700
but I am not a drug grocer!

17:38.370 --> 17:40.170
I'm out of drugs!

17:40.290 --> 17:41.840
See how much money I made?!

17:43.850 --> 17:44.590
Chief Wiggum.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.150
Are you still with the police department?

17:47.490 --> 17:49.290
Save it, Ma peddle!

17:50.610 --> 17:51.590
Ma peddle?

17:51.830 --> 17:55.250
It's a reference to ma kettle. A popular 
movie character from the '40s.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.000
If you have to explain it, it's not good, chief.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.160
Well, boy, you made the right choice.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.550
I think this is the first step to a new, 

18:02.550 --> 18:03.860
closer relationship between us.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.390
Dad, I think you actually enjoy 
seeing your own son suffer.

18:07.690 --> 18:09.040
Je n'aime pas ca.

18:09.430 --> 18:11.120
Being a father is just a job.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.830
Long hours, no pay, and at the end, 

18:12.990 --> 18:16.680
all you get is someone yelling, 
"you screwed me up"!

18:16.920 --> 18:19.760
Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more,
I wouldn't be so screwed up.

18:19.950 --> 18:21.610
Hey, I enjoy you plenty.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.180
Talking time is over.

18:29.530 --> 18:30.650
Don't worry, Mr. Simpson.

18:30.890 --> 18:33.340
We're gonna take his "sass" and turn it into "siss."

18:33.510 --> 18:34.270
Thank you, colonel.

18:34.510 --> 18:35.200
I'm not a colonel.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.600
This is a boy scout uniform that I  dolled up.

18:37.980 --> 18:38.830
Come with me, son.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.180
Now kiss your childhood good-bye.

19:03.330 --> 19:05.420
Vegas here I come!

19:11.730 --> 19:12.680
I miss you, dad.

19:13.850 --> 19:16.130
Hey, Homer, you wanna eat my shorts?

19:27.820 --> 19:30.070
Don't gamble on my love, Homer.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.500
I miss Bart.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.800
I can't leave him in that awful camp.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.560
I'm coming, boy!

19:40.250 --> 19:41.150
Oh! Oh, wait.

19:42.010 --> 19:42.770
Get off here.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.060
I bet this looks cool  from overhead, though.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.260
Vegas, here I come!

19:54.560 --> 19:55.650
Right. Bart.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.610
Nicely chopped, Simpson.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.640
I've learned so much in my three hours here.

20:09.950 --> 20:12.120
I don't have to play pranks to feel good.

20:12.310 --> 20:16.110
I can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.

20:17.140 --> 20:17.970
Stupid horse!

20:18.160 --> 20:20.440
It's a deer  crossing! 

20:21.020 --> 20:22.940
Wipe  the blood off the windshield 
and get in the car, boy!

20:23.030 --> 20:23.560
Dad?

20:23.660 --> 20:27.790
Son, I'm doing something I should 
have done a long time ago.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.790
Taking you to Vegas!

20:30.010 --> 20:32.330
I'm gonna order a steak dinner 
and eat it on the toilet!

20:32.500 --> 20:33.930
And don't you try to stop us.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.130
Actually, we were gonna call you, Mr.Simpson.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.540
Your credit card was declined.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.610
Try this one...!

20:45.580 --> 20:47.170
Homer, I hope you get this.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.570
I'm in jail and I need $10,000 bail.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.380
Hurry!

20:52.980 --> 20:55.070
Marge. Me and Bart got in a 
fight with this really 

20:55.070 --> 20:57.180
un-cool pit boss

20:57.470 --> 20:59.050
and now we're in Nevada state prison.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.560
Also, I don't know where Bart is.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.020
If you see him, say "hey."

21:04.410 --> 21:06.800
Well, maggie, I always knew it would some day

21:06.800 --> 21:08.440
boil down to just you and me.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.580
I'll look for work in the morning.
