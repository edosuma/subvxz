WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.264
narrator: previously onstargate atlantis.

00:03.307 --> 00:05.701
They're not people.
They're machines.

00:05.744 --> 00:08.834
WEIR: They even
built themselves
a version of Atlantis.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.575
[SCREAMS]

00:10.619 --> 00:13.839
Probes of your minds
uncover the truth.
You only came to live there

00:13.883 --> 00:16.407
from your original home,
a planet called Earth.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.800
Our intention
is to destroy it.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.237
They see humans
as the favored siblings

00:20.281 --> 00:22.283
who receive
all their parents' love.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.850
They've been seeking
revenge ever since.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.853
Atlantis is under attack
from Replicators.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.203
SHEPPARD: I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

00:29.246 --> 00:32.467
a bunch of Replicators
take our home away from us.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.077
McKAY: They emit
a directional energy beam

00:34.121 --> 00:36.253
that disrupts the connection
between nanites.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.647
So the Replicators
literally fall apart
when you fire on them.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.650
Well, we beat them this time.
Maybe we scared them off.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.087
Maybe.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.441
KELLER: Dr. Weir.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.878
Dr. Keller,
how is my Head of Medicine?

00:52.922 --> 00:54.880
Acting Head
of Medicine, actually,

00:54.924 --> 00:57.579
and that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.189
What's up?

01:00.321 --> 01:03.846
I need to be replaced. Excuse me?

01:03.889 --> 01:08.677
Look, after Carson,
someone had to step up
and take over,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.896
and I'm glad to help out.
Don't get me wrong.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.725
But I'm not qualified
to run a department
of this size.

01:13.769 --> 01:18.121
You need someone better.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.471
Everyone down there
says you're doing great.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.256
Well, A, I'm not sure
that's true,

01:22.299 --> 01:24.910
and, B, it's been
pretty smooth sailing

01:24.954 --> 01:26.912
over the last few weeks.
I think I've been lucky.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.915
Now, the IOA
are reviewing candidates,
but to be honest,

01:29.959 --> 01:31.743
they're not that great
at making quick decisions.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.877
Yeah. So a week?
Two weeks?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.922
I just haven't been
sleeping very well.

01:36.966 --> 01:39.925
This whole
being-in-control thing
kind of makes me anxious.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.276
Carson felt the same way
his first few months.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.843
I appreciate
your trying to lie to me.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.894
Look, I feel very comfortable
with my life in your hands,

01:51.937 --> 01:55.506
and at the end of the day,
that means you're doing
a pretty good job.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.380
Dealing with the pressure,
it does get easier with time.

01:59.423 --> 02:03.123
Right. How much time exactly?

02:04.211 --> 02:06.082
Like, it'll get easier
over the next two weeks,

02:06.126 --> 02:10.391
and then you'll replace me
so I can go back
to being a regular doctor?

02:10.434 --> 02:12.175
I'll keep you posted.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.048
Thanks.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.836
Can I please
have someone else do these?

02:20.879 --> 02:22.794
Performance evaluations? Yes.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.406
No, year-end
employee reviews
are important.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.756
They're how people
get promotions and raises.

02:27.799 --> 02:28.931
Okay, look,
asking me to do

02:28.974 --> 02:30.802
performance evaluations
is ridiculous.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.282
I am the first person to admit

02:32.326 --> 02:34.066
I don't know
who these people are,
nor do I care to.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.068
Look, if you'd like,
I could take you
down the hall to the labs

02:36.112 --> 02:37.374
and just point at the people

02:37.418 --> 02:38.549
who annoy me
more than the rest,

02:38.593 --> 02:39.898
but that's about
as useful as I get.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.248
[DOOR SLIDING OPEN]

02:42.684 --> 02:44.555
All done. Oh, of course.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.991
That was quick.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.994
Hey, John, wait a minute.

02:49.038 --> 02:49.995
You've just given everyone

02:50.039 --> 02:51.606
"Excellent
and above averages."

02:51.649 --> 02:53.390
Can I do that? WEIR: No.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.827
I know this is not
the most glamorous
part of your job,

02:55.871 --> 02:59.048
but you are
in leadership positions,
and, unfortunately,

02:59.091 --> 03:01.616
that comes
with administrative
responsibilities.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.834
Well, everybody
who works for me

03:02.878 --> 03:04.749
is excellent
and above average.

03:04.793 --> 03:09.058
You want me to lie?
'Cause I don't think leaders
should lie, Elizabeth.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.408
CHUCK: Dr. Weir? Yes, Chuck?

03:11.452 --> 03:13.845
The Apollojust came out
of hyperspace.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.021
They're ahead of schedule.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.501
Probably just trying
to show off.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.721
You know,
being a new ship and all.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.680
Colonel Ellis,
you've made excellent time
on your first voyage here.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.465
ELLIS: Thank you.
I'm beaming down now.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.162
Very well. We'll meet...

03:30.297 --> 03:32.690
Set up
in the conference room.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.606
Doctor. Colonel, welcome.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.999
Thank you.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.915
Colonel Sheppard. Dr. McKay.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.090
This is gonna make
things easier.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.092
I'll need to brief
you all immediately.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.094
What's going on?

03:45.137 --> 03:47.227
I'd prefer
to talk in private.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.846
Ever since
the human-form Replicators

03:57.889 --> 03:59.456
made a play for the city,

03:59.500 --> 04:02.981
we've had the Daedalus
make regular
reconnaissance flybys

04:03.025 --> 04:04.461
of their home planet.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.897
Yes, we know.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.596
Two months ago,
it took these pictures.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.861
I'm sorry.
What am I supposed
to be looking at here?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.297
ELLIS: Nothing.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.733
Excuse me?

04:16.821 --> 04:20.260
This image was taken
about three weeks ago

04:20.303 --> 04:22.566
in the very same location.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.048
They're building ships,
a lot of them.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.268
SHEPPARD: Why weren't we
made aware of this?

04:28.311 --> 04:31.096
I'm making you
aware of it now.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.881
If they're coming for us,
we should start
making preparations

04:32.924 --> 04:34.143
to bolster the shield,
and we should...

04:34.186 --> 04:35.927
They're not
gonna get here.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.582
I'm here to inform you
that in precisely 12 hours,

04:38.626 --> 04:41.455
the Apollo,
in consort with your team,

04:41.498 --> 04:43.370
will launch
a surgical strike

04:43.413 --> 04:45.415
on the Replicator planet.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.529
So you're gonna blow up
their ships?

05:55.572 --> 05:56.660
That's right.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.532
Just like that? Just like that.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.360
How the hell do you plan
on doing that?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.753
A set of Mark-9
tactical nukes

06:02.797 --> 06:06.975
housed in a custom-made
weapons platform
codenamed Horizon.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.324
How many nukes do you have?

06:08.368 --> 06:11.066
The Horizon carries
six warheads and four decoys.

06:11.109 --> 06:14.069
I'm gonna need you to do
a final inspection
before we head out.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.637
Wait. Six? ELLIS: That's right.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.595
That's not enough.

06:18.639 --> 06:22.817
The Replicators
are self-replicating robots,
which means that they can...

06:22.860 --> 06:24.775
I'm aware of that.
Thank you, Doctor.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.777
But they're not
like the Milky Way
Replicators.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.649
Their ships aren't built
from nanocells.

06:28.692 --> 06:32.392
They're constructed
of real material
that can be destroyed.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.307
Six will be more
than enough for now. For now?

06:35.351 --> 06:37.614
Look, isn't this a bit
like poking a sleeping dragon?

06:37.658 --> 06:41.313
Why don't we just wait
until Area 51
finishes the PWARWs?

06:41.357 --> 06:42.489
Which one is that again?

06:42.532 --> 06:44.447
Planetary-Wide
Anti-Replicator Weapons.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.493
Look, the Asgard
were capable of creating
a satellite

06:46.536 --> 06:48.930
that could wipe out
an entire Replicator planet.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.019
I mean, we've had some trouble
making one of our own, but...

06:51.062 --> 06:53.108
Look, would I have preferred

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066
taking out
an entire planet at once?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.720
Absolutely,

06:56.764 --> 07:00.115
but this image
is giving the IOA
a lot of sleepless nights.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.857
The Replicators know
the location of Earth,

07:02.900 --> 07:05.425
and, with these new ships,
have the means to get there.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.730
We can't just sit on our hands

07:06.774 --> 07:08.602
while the guys at Area 51

07:08.645 --> 07:10.604
try to come up
with a solution.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.128
Now, this mission's
primary objective

07:13.171 --> 07:16.261
is to eliminate
key military targets.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.308
We'll come back and finish
once the new weapon
is up and running.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.485
Doctor, I'm gonna need you
to start your inspections
as soon as possible.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.660
Well, yeah, sure. I just...

07:23.704 --> 07:25.357
Dr. McKay is ready to beam.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.534
Well, he's not
actually ready...

07:30.493 --> 07:31.668
ELLIS: Okay.

07:33.931 --> 07:37.500
We're finished here.
Thank you.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.681
Can you believe this? No.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.293
I mean, it seems
too good to be true.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.905
What?

07:50.948 --> 07:54.299
Well, if those nukes do
what Ellis says they do...

07:54.343 --> 07:55.866
Since we won back the city,

07:55.910 --> 07:58.652
we haven't heard
so much as a peep
from the Replicators.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.915
Obviously,
they haven't gone away.

08:00.958 --> 08:04.179
No, but maybe they've decided
that we are more trouble
than we're worth.

08:04.222 --> 08:08.662
The threat of our AR weapons
is enough to keep them at bay.

08:08.705 --> 08:12.230
You don't build
that many ships
to make a run at Atlantis.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.625
They're headed for Earth.

08:21.936 --> 08:25.374
WEIR: Colonel,
may I have a word?

08:25.417 --> 08:26.636
ELLIS: Sure.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.689
This mission is a mistake.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.604
It most certainly is not.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.910
It is an ineffectual
first strike.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.912
You got to know
how dangerous
that could be for us.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.611
All due respect, Doctor,
it won't be ineffectual.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.135
Besides, the IOA
doesn't think we can wait.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.440
I think we should stall them.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.312
Try to open
a round of negotiations.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.357
They're not a race of people.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.316
They're a weapon.
Try to keep that in mind.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.536
Weapon or not,
they're sentient.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.799
Negotiating with them
could buy us enough time

08:58.842 --> 09:01.453
to get the PWARW
up and running.

09:01.497 --> 09:04.239
Usually, I'd be
more than happy
to go twelve rounds here

09:04.282 --> 09:05.980
about who's right
and who's wrong,

09:06.023 --> 09:07.372
but it wouldn't matter.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.896
I have my orders,

09:08.939 --> 09:10.767
and you don't have
the authority to tell me
to stand down,

09:10.811 --> 09:16.468
so again,
with all due respect, ma'am,
I have a mission to execute.

09:25.434 --> 09:28.263
ZELENKA:
Well, the specs check out.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.744
We've loaded
the target information.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.267
They're ready.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.182
McKAY: Yep, it's good to go.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.446
This is a bad idea,
isn't it?

09:37.489 --> 09:39.187
We could tell them
they're not ready.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.755
You know, there's a fault
with the guidance system
or something.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.408
I thought about that.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.410
They're gonna have guys
here to contradict us
pretty quickly.

09:45.454 --> 09:50.285
Yep, but we're here alone.
We could make them not ready.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.028
They're building
an armada, Radek.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.987
I saw them.
They showed me the pictures.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.598
I'd feel pretty stupid
if we break this thing

09:58.641 --> 10:01.078
only to have
the Replicators show up
and destroy the city.

10:01.122 --> 10:05.256
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be bad.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.610
McKAY: Tell the Colonel
we're good to go.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.832
SHEPPARD: Hey. WEIR: Hey.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.969
Colonel Ellis has asked me
to join the mission.

10:22.665 --> 10:23.884
I know.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.365
I was gonna stay behind
in a Cloak Jumper

10:27.409 --> 10:28.366
after they launched
the warheads,

10:28.410 --> 10:30.281
do some battle-damage
assessment.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.718
I know that, too.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.504
He told me that you called
Woolsey and General O'Neill

10:35.547 --> 10:37.332
and tried to get
the whole thing called off.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.116
Yes, I did.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.120
They didn't bite? They did not.

10:43.164 --> 10:47.037
Look, I know you think
we're doing the wrong
thing here, but...

10:47.081 --> 10:48.560
John?

10:50.432 --> 10:51.607
Good luck.

11:04.446 --> 11:09.277
All right, Horizon is online,
warheads are armed,

11:09.320 --> 11:12.497
and we are ready
for final sequencing

11:12.541 --> 11:15.065
as soon as we drop
out of hyperspace.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.153
ELLIS: Start now.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.546
Open the bomb bay doors.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.982
McKAY:
We're still in hyperspace.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.288
We're coming out
of our jump

11:20.331 --> 11:21.855
uncomfortably close
to the planet.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.771
I don't want
to waste any time.
Just get it done.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.686
Well, you're the boss.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.005
Ready to launch
on your command.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.399
You're sure
about this, right?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.140
Like, this is
the right thing to do?

11:46.183 --> 11:48.795
Not the best time
for that kind
of talk, Doctor.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.406
Right. Sorry.

11:51.449 --> 11:56.585
Coming out of hyperspace
in five, four,
three, two, one.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.156
Launch the Horizon.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.982
We have detonation
confirmation
on all six warheads.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.853
Sheppard, you have
a go for launch.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.333
Copy that.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.905
SHEPPARD: I'm clear.
Jump away.

13:38.948 --> 13:42.343
Very well,
pick you up in an hour.
Get us out of here.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.097
ZELENKA:
There is so much
radiation interference.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.620
It's hard to get
an accurate
yield calculation

13:58.663 --> 13:59.839
from the scan telemetry.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.318
Please! There is more
than enough data.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.277
It's not like
we're trying to take out
a person here.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.540
We're taking out
massive chunks of a city.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.630
Someone just please tell me
if we hit our targets or not.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.502
All right,
if this data is right,

14:11.546 --> 14:15.506
then all of your primaries
and most of your secondaries
have been incinerated.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.943
Excellent.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.256
Welcome back. Thanks.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.041
I hear congratulations
are in order.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.651
You heard right.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.914
How was the mission?
Was it a success?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.655
We did get all the ships.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.526
I wish I could
have been there
to see it.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.702
Space battles are always
a lot more exciting on TV

14:37.746 --> 14:39.400
than they are in real life.

14:39.443 --> 14:43.665
CHUCK: Dr. Weir,
you're gonna want
to see this.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.363
We've got a contact.
It just came out
of hyperspace.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.626
WEIR: Is it
broadcasting IFF?No, ma'am.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.714
Wraith?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.542
It's very small.
I doubt it.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
Raise the shield.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.764
It's taking up
a geosynchronous orbit
above the city.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.375
What is it?

14:58.419 --> 15:01.161
Maybe we should
have the Apollo
check it out.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.641
Tell the Colonel
he needs to get back
to his ship.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.314
Right ahead of us, sir.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.969
Shields? WOMAN: Affirmative.
Shields are up.

15:30.277 --> 15:34.498
Okay, I've got a visual.
Looks like a satellite
of some sort.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.554
It's a stargate.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.687
Stargate? ELLIS: That's right.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.776
I thought you said
it was a satellite.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.387
It's both. It's a satellite,

15:53.430 --> 15:55.650
but in the middle,
there's a stargate.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.000
What could be
the purpose of that?

15:58.044 --> 15:59.262
No idea.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.225
It just activated. SHEPPARD: The gate?

16:10.186 --> 16:12.972
ELLIS: Get us away from it!

16:13.015 --> 16:15.191
Sir, the satellite
is turning again.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.505
It's hitting the planet.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.908
It's a sustained beam.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.867
That is bad
for a dozen different reasons.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.877
It's protected by a shield.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.705
Give me some options, McKay.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.012
The shield is taking
its power from the beam.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.449
I registered
a slight drop in output
when you fired on it.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.059
ELLIS: Could I get a nuke
past its shield?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.539
No, probably not.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.193
I'll get in the chair
and give it
everything we got.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.411
Maybe that'll
collapse the shield.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.544
I said "slight,"
as in .002.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.546
Look, I doubt
any amount of firepower
is gonna collapse it

17:05.589 --> 17:06.677
while that beam is active.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.592
Then what do we do?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.246
McKAY: We stand down
and let me think
is what we do.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.031
Just give me five minutes
to get my bearings.
I'll brief you.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.641
McKay, it's shooting at us.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.860
And the shields are holding.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.950
Look, we got plenty of time.
Just give me five minutes.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.487
ELLIS: What have you got?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.271
We're in trouble.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.839
SHEPPARD: Five minutes
to figure that out?
You're slipping, buddy.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.668
The satellite is basically
just a stripped-down ship.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.799
There's a hyperdrive engine,

17:41.843 --> 17:43.323
a shield
and navigational systems.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.673
There's a small power source
that was designed to take it

17:45.716 --> 17:48.763
to its intended target
and power the shield
until the gate can be dialed,

17:48.806 --> 17:50.678
but once a wormhole
has been established,

17:50.721 --> 17:51.940
whoever is on
the dialing side

17:51.983 --> 17:53.724
fires a beam
into their stargate,

17:53.768 --> 17:55.204
and it comes out on our side,

17:55.248 --> 17:57.728
allowing them to fire on us
and to power the satellite.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.904
It's very clever.McKAY: Yes.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.255
As long as they can keep
the beam powered from home,

18:02.298 --> 18:03.995
the weapon
remains operational.

18:04.039 --> 18:07.086
Oh, and one fun added
side bonus is that
because their stargate

18:07.129 --> 18:09.131
is in such close proximity
to our planet,

18:09.175 --> 18:11.351
we can't dial our stargate.
We're stuck.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.527
Maybe that's a good thing.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.791
The beam will turn off
at the end of the gate's
38-minute cycle.

18:16.834 --> 18:20.751
If we dial our gate
at that precise moment,
we can neutralize theirs.

18:20.795 --> 18:24.277
And if it's not pulling power
from the beam anymore,

18:24.320 --> 18:26.496
then we can collapse
its shield and destroy it.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.934
Sure. The problem is,
I don't think it's gonna
shut down in 38 minutes.

18:29.978 --> 18:33.286
I thought
it was physically impossible
for an artificial wormhole

18:33.329 --> 18:34.635
to stay open any longer.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.506
There is one exception
to that rule.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.291
The SGC
has encountered
attacks of this kind

18:38.334 --> 18:40.031
on their own stargate,

18:40.075 --> 18:42.817
and sadly, we've discovered
that if you pump
enough energy into it,

18:42.860 --> 18:44.906
a stargate can remain
active indefinitely.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.996
That would require
an insane amount of power,
wouldn't it?

18:48.039 --> 18:50.912
Like a black hole
or an unlimited number
of ZPMs.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.654
So we can assume
the Replicators
are behind this.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.612
I hope so. You hope so?

18:55.656 --> 18:58.354
Otherwise,
we've discovered yet another
super-powerful enemy.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.790
If it is a normal stargate,

18:59.834 --> 19:01.618
can we still contact
the dialing planet?

19:01.662 --> 19:03.229
Well, I'll need to boost
the signal considerably

19:03.272 --> 19:05.840
to get through
the interference, but yes.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.972
See what you
can do, please. Right.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.671
Why would you
want to contact them?

19:10.714 --> 19:12.368
To negotiate.

19:12.412 --> 19:16.155
It's a waste of energy.
We need to figure out
how to destroy it.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.808
I'd loved to go
12 rounds here

19:17.852 --> 19:19.810
about who's right
and who's wrong,

19:19.854 --> 19:22.422
but at the end of the day,
I'm responsible for
the well-being of this city,

19:22.465 --> 19:25.990
and you don't
have the authority
to tell me to stand down,

19:26.034 --> 19:29.385
so, with all due respect,
I think I'll place my call.

19:37.132 --> 19:41.005
All right,
I think I've got it.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.443
They're responding
to transmission.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.228
Oberoth.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.621
OBEROTH: Dr. Weir.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.014
I must say
I'm surprised to see you.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.016
Each of us exist
within the collective

19:52.060 --> 19:54.410
and can be replicated
many times.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.847
You need to disable
your weapon immediately.

19:56.891 --> 19:57.979
That is not possible.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.546
We had no choice
but to attack you.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.113
You were building warships.
They need to be neutralized.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.420
And now so do you.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.075
That assault was just
the tip of the spear.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.817
We were hoping
it would bring you
to your senses.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.079
If you don't stop
this aggression,

20:11.122 --> 20:13.995
we'll be forced to launch
an all-out attack.

20:14.038 --> 20:17.085
Really? Why have you waited?

20:17.128 --> 20:20.741
The annihilation
of your people
is not our goal.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.873
Ideally, we would like
for peace to exist
between us...

20:22.917 --> 20:24.701
[COMPUTER BEEPING]

20:24.745 --> 20:25.920
but we will not stand
idly by while you build
ships and weapons

20:25.963 --> 20:27.400
that can be used
to destroy us.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.879
OBEROTH: Interesting.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.099
We feel the same way
about you.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.143
Perhaps I should remind you

20:32.187 --> 20:33.623
every time
we've met in battle,

20:33.667 --> 20:35.669
our side has been
clearly victorious.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.236
Elizabeth,
they're attempting
to upload a virus

20:37.279 --> 20:38.411
on the comm bandwidth.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.629
I'm able to stop it
for now, but I'm not...

20:39.673 --> 20:40.935
Shut it down.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.679
Well, that went well.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.203
Yeah, he's always been
one of my favorites.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.727
What if the gate
doesn't shut down

20:50.771 --> 20:53.861
at the end
of its 38-minute cycle?

20:53.904 --> 20:56.429
Look, if they're able
to maintain
the energy beam's intensity,

20:56.472 --> 20:57.517
which I'm sure they will...

20:57.560 --> 21:00.128
And how long till
our shield fails?

21:00.171 --> 21:01.782
Just 29 hours.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.107
Well, it was worth a shot.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.675
All right,
we're gonna need
another plan.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.111
Yeah, okay.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.508
McKAY: Stop dialing.
It's not working.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.510
SHEPPARD: Sir.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.122
You two give us a minute.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.430
What can I do for you, John?

21:43.737 --> 21:45.695
We need to head back
to the Replicator planet.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.175
We do, do we?

21:47.218 --> 21:50.004
If this satellite weapon
is powered by its home world,

21:50.047 --> 21:52.354
maybe we can neutralize
it at the source.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.313
Well, the Apollo
is in no condition

21:54.356 --> 21:55.792
to get in a battle right now.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.925
That beam took
a lot out of our shield.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.143
We got to do something.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.362
We did do something.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.321
I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't help to think

22:02.364 --> 22:04.366
that we're somehow
responsible for this.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.237
Why? Because Weir said so?

22:06.281 --> 22:07.587
No, sir.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.023
John, listen to me.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.809
I've been over your record.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.376
I know you have
your detractors,

22:14.420 --> 22:17.727
but personally,
I think you've done
a hell of a job here.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.033
Thank you, sir.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.949
You should be
running Atlantis,
not Dr. Weir.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.952
Well, then I'd be the man,

22:24.995 --> 22:27.563
and who would I have
to rage against?

22:29.217 --> 22:32.133
Listen, because of us,

22:32.176 --> 22:35.223
Earth won't have to deal
with an armada
of Replicator ships,

22:35.266 --> 22:39.183
so whatever happens here,
we did the right thing today.

22:43.405 --> 22:47.757
WEIR: I'm sorry.
It's just they
didn't even consult me.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.412
TEYLA: I imagine
they felt the need
for secrecy was great.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.415
I have the highest
level of clearance
humanly possible, Teyla.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.026
No, they're trying
to undermine me.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.377
Some of the military
doesn't like that a civilian,

22:58.420 --> 23:00.988
let alone a woman,
is in charge of this city.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.251
Surely, General O'Neill
doesn't feel that way.

23:03.294 --> 23:06.254
And the IOA, they've backed
you several times.
They believe in you.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.995
Yes, when things
are going well,

23:08.038 --> 23:10.214
but as soon as we run
into a major problem,

23:10.258 --> 23:13.261
the military steps in
and assumes absolute control.

23:13.304 --> 23:16.699
Certainly, you don't wish
to coordinate
military attacks.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.788
No, that's not
what I'm saying. Look,

23:18.832 --> 23:21.922
our current situation
could have easily
been avoided.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.358
I told them as much.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.186
But they put
next to no weight
behind my opinions

23:25.229 --> 23:27.580
regarding the safety
and protection of this city.

23:27.623 --> 23:31.627
Yes, the IOA
is happy to have me
as lead administrator,

23:31.671 --> 23:34.456
but when it comes
to the big decisions...

23:38.982 --> 23:42.116
If we get out of this,
I think I may
have to step down.

23:42.159 --> 23:45.162
Give it some time.
You need to step back and...

23:45.206 --> 23:46.903
McKAY: We've got something.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.045
We were throwing some ideas
back and forth.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.308
Well, he was throwing
them forth,
and I was throwing them back.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.266
While he was droning on
about some idea
that might have worked,

24:02.310 --> 24:03.920
it suddenly occurred to me.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.445
This city has encountered
problems like this
before, so I...

24:06.488 --> 24:09.273
I don't need the history
of your idea, Doctor.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.231
I'll let that
be a surprise

24:10.274 --> 24:11.624
when I read
your autobiography.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.495
Just tell me the plan.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.237
We submerge it.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.196
I'm sorry?We submerge the city.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.938
I thought you said
we couldn't submerge the city.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.723
That was two years ago
before the Ancients came

24:23.766 --> 24:25.942
and activated a number
of new systems. See...

24:25.986 --> 24:28.684
The how is complicated,
but I think it's possible.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.164
Look, it's not
a permanent solution...

24:30.207 --> 24:33.123
But it'll buy us enough time
till we come up with one.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.169
Exactly. How much time?

24:35.212 --> 24:36.257
Some, as much as a week.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.085
I don't understand. Why?

24:38.128 --> 24:40.391
You see the history part
would have made that
a lot clearer.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.567
Had you been
a little more patient

24:41.610 --> 24:43.133
I would have painted you
a picture of...

24:43.177 --> 24:44.178
McKay!

24:45.919 --> 24:47.311
Ten thousand years ago,

24:47.355 --> 24:49.226
when the Ancients were
under siege from the Wraiths,

24:49.270 --> 24:51.315
they sank the city
in order to dissipate

24:51.359 --> 24:53.187
the Wraiths' energy blasts
in the water.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.363
This way,
the shield was able
to hold far longer

24:55.406 --> 24:56.712
than it ever could
on the surface.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.106
So, now, we submerge the city.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.282
The water attenuates
the satellite's
beam intensity,

25:01.325 --> 25:03.110
buys us some more shield time.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.504
We cannot predict
how much the Replicator's beam
will be attenuated.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.418
It might not buy us
any time at all.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.681
There's no way
to know for sure, yes,

25:08.724 --> 25:10.030
but it's not
a reason not to try.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.335
All right, get it done.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.946
Yeah, I don't think
that's your call.

25:15.470 --> 25:18.691
Worst-case scenario,
we lose some power
from the ZPM?

25:18.734 --> 25:21.128
Oh, no, worst-case scenario
is that we've both read
the numbers wrong,

25:21.171 --> 25:23.522
we use up a ton of power,
and the city doesn't
submerge at all.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.698
Look, as much
as I hate to say it,

25:25.741 --> 25:27.438
Zelenka is not infallible.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.487
Still, I agree.
It's worth the risk.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.273
All right, the city
has an automatic
submersion subroutine

25:36.317 --> 25:38.362
already in the system.
I'll need to tweak it a bit

25:38.406 --> 25:42.410
to work with one ZPM
and disable some
safety protocols.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.977
Give me an hour.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.386
It's been an hour.We're ready?

26:02.430 --> 26:04.475
No, you've got
to do the...Oh, just...

26:07.478 --> 26:10.786

all personnel. We are about to
attempt to submerge the city.

26:20.535 --> 26:23.669
From what I understand,
it could get a little bumpy,

26:23.712 --> 26:26.410
so this is your last chance
to secure equipment

26:26.454 --> 26:28.891
and get to the designated
safe areas.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.242
We've come full circle, eh?

26:32.286 --> 26:34.418
Yeah, it feels that way.

26:36.246 --> 26:39.162
Okay, take us down.

pretty serious, Rodney.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.846
I know. Just give me
a second to... Crap!

27:53.889 --> 27:55.282
I told you.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.849
Thank you, Radek.
Very helpful.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.285
What is it?

27:58.328 --> 27:59.416
The beam is breaking
through the water

27:59.460 --> 28:01.288
much more efficiently
that we thought.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.985
The water has no effect?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.726
It's having an effect
but just nowhere near
what we want it to.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.902
Look, that plan took us
three hours to execute

28:06.946 --> 28:09.905
and bought us
an additional 10 hours.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.907
Nine.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.039
Nine.

28:14.518 --> 28:17.043
Okay, what's the plan?

28:21.134 --> 28:22.701
That was the plan.

some science.

I'm not all that useful
in situations like these.

If we get into a fight
or need to break out
of somewhere,

I don't know
where to chip in.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.017
No. No, and McKay
is not a human torch.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.628
Well, how come you get
to be Mister Fantastic?

Please! We both know

No, the Replicators

we did with the drones.

We just don't have
the power. Yeah, but ideally...

30:32.352 --> 30:34.310
It'd be the only way. What?

30:35.485 --> 30:36.922
The drilling platform.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.924
You guys
have it operational
down there, right?

30:38.967 --> 30:41.317
It's close enough,
but we couldn't
bring it with us.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.103
Bring it where? We don't need to.
We just need a boost.

to something here.

is already in place.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.766
McKAY: Yes, I know.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.507
Look, are you capable
of outputting the power
we need or not?

30:57.551 --> 30:59.248
We just started drilling
into the crust.

I can get you nine percent
of the way there.

There goes that plan.Can't the ZPM
make up the difference?

31:04.514 --> 31:07.866
No, the ZPM is a little busy
powering the shield at max.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.174
What if it didn't have to? What?

31:12.218 --> 31:16.265
What if we could
take the strain off
the shield momentarily?

31:16.309 --> 31:19.790
Well, we'd need
about a minute. Why?
What do you have in mind?

31:19.834 --> 31:22.576

has some sizable
satellites itself.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.883

we think are left over
from a second moon

31:24.926 --> 31:26.754
that no longer exists.

I'd like you to beam up Lorne
and get a flight of F-302s
close enough

31:30.323 --> 31:31.759
to nudge one our way.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.936
You want to bring
an asteroid towards us.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.547
Is that wise?Well, today, it is.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.908
LORNE: All right, guys,
we need to get close enough
to clamp onto it.

31:49.951 --> 31:54.738
Get enough of us drilled in,
we can fly it like a ship,
a very slow ship.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.827
It's probably gonna be
a real pain in the ass
to steer.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.655
But a ship nonetheless.

able to get here
before our cut-off time.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.614
WEIR: So we can
actually do this?

32:44.658 --> 32:46.312

As you all know,
we have found ourselves
in a spot of trouble.

The reality is
that no matter where
we try to hide on this planet,

33:05.200 --> 33:08.856
the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

33:08.899 --> 33:12.512
Therefore, Dr. McKay

and the crew down there
have been beamed up

McKAY:
What, the drilling platform?
Oh, hell, yes.

35:10.804 --> 35:14.851
But 30% of our total
power requirements
are gonna be consumed

35:14.895 --> 35:16.810
in the first
10 seconds of flight.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.725
The station will provide us
with that power

35:18.768 --> 35:20.509
right up until
we snap the umbilical,

35:20.553 --> 35:22.772
at which point
we switch over to the ZPM.

35:22.816 --> 35:26.950
Now, if we can interrupt
the satellite's beam,

35:26.994 --> 35:28.952
which is greatly
taxing our power levels,

35:28.996 --> 35:31.390
we should be able
to squeeze out
just enough power

you can do this? Fly the city?

possibly be talking about?

Well, you had to use
your hands and feet

This one, you just have
to sit down and think, "Fly."

Okay, why don't you
just get in the chair
and start your preflight?

Oh, I'm going to head up
to the control room,

Are you ready, Sheppard? Ready as I'll ever be.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.244
Okay, Major,
make sure she's moving
as slow as possible.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.073
Are you sure we shouldn't
just lob this thing
at the satellite?

36:46.116 --> 36:47.814
No, it needs to be
able to navigate back
into position.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.295
This is still our best bet. LORNE: Copy that.

36:59.434 --> 37:02.089

37:02.132 --> 37:06.006
We're heading back
to theApollo. Good luck.

based on current speed.

We don't have enough power.

What other reasons
could there be?

to give you.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.852
Lower the shield. We're about to go into space.

38:52.895 --> 38:55.333
If you plan on breathing,
we're gonna need the shield.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.335
Turn it back on
at 18,000 feet.

38:57.378 --> 39:00.250

to get started. No?

the tower and blew out the...

just has a cut.

worse off upstairs.

Is she gonna be okay? I don't know yet.

She took quite a fall,
and her pupils are sluggish.

under a scanner.

I didn't need any help.

to the infirmary.

the side of the tower

At current consumption,
we've got 24 hours
of power left.

it needs to be calibrated
to a specific location.

way too soon.
