the wooden paneling.

01:13.790 --> 01:14.650
Uh...

01:14.720 --> 01:15.820

01:31.070 --> 01:32.940
You know,
you're watchin' the game, but,

01:33.010 --> 01:35.740
uh, it's sort of like
you are in action, even though,

01:35.810 --> 01:37.140
you know, you might be...

01:37.210 --> 01:38.410
you know, passed out.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.450
l don't like how you try to
sell my house.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.810
Come on, man.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.580
This is a sport lover's fantasy!

01:44.650 --> 01:46.710
l don't like sports.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.720
No one does.

01:47.790 --> 01:50.850
All right, look, uh,
let's be frank here.

01:50.930 --> 01:53.720
That gas leak is gonna kill
anybody

01:53.800 --> 01:55.060
that tries to move in here.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.360

for you or anyone.

01:57.430 --> 01:58.960
All right. Fine, fine.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.200

02:00.270 --> 02:01.530
But are you...

02:01.600 --> 02:03.470

on that price?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.510
l mean, 20 grand a month, man...

02:05.570 --> 02:06.970
l need that money!

02:07.040 --> 02:08.870
The cost of blood is going up.

02:08.940 --> 02:09.770
l need to feed.

02:09.850 --> 02:11.810
Yeah, you keep throwing
around words like

02:11.880 --> 02:13.370
"blood" and "feed."

02:13.450 --> 02:14.680
l mean, feed what?

02:14.750 --> 02:15.980
Never you mind.

02:16.050 --> 02:17.780
l've said too much already.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.620
l'm so stupid...
stupid.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.990
l mean, maybe paint a mural of,
like, the...

02:22.060 --> 02:25.820

cresting a hill.

02:25.900 --> 02:29.460
Carl, l'm starting to think
you aren't right for this job.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.730
This is not a fit.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.790
Really?

02:31.870 --> 02:33.660
Well, then fit this.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.000
You need me, l'm next door

Oh, yeah.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.140
Ohhhh.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.480
You are naughty.

02:48.550 --> 02:51.820
Yes, you are a cheerleader,

02:51.890 --> 02:55.410
An enormous 300-pound
cheerleader.

02:55.490 --> 02:58.460
Not too many cheerleaders
missing teeth, but, uh, sure,

02:58.530 --> 02:59.860

03:07.070 --> 03:10.510
it's got to be just completely
bananas to get me off.

03:10.570 --> 03:11.770
Hey!

03:11.840 --> 03:13.000
Oh, baby.

l spent about three nights in
the clink 'cause of that,

04:23.250 --> 04:24.740
but it was so worth it

04:24.810 --> 04:28.340
to see you just drop to your
knees in anguish.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.150
So, what are you doin' here, man,

04:30.220 --> 04:31.850

04:45.670 --> 04:47.190
Oh, like a band, yeah.

04:47.270 --> 04:49.330
Uh, no.
No, that's not really it.

Oh, you suck.

05:16.570 --> 05:19.060
John Kruk is not
a good singer

05:19.130 --> 05:22.760
We mask his hideous voice
with more volume

05:22.840 --> 05:23.740
What the...

05:23.810 --> 05:25.400
y-you kidnap me, you torture me

Yeah, l guess.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.210
Hey, what do you guys
think if this guy

05:40.290 --> 05:42.150

05:42.220 --> 05:43.780
You know,

05:43.860 --> 05:45.380
Yeah, l could totally
take his place here.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.620
No, no, John Kruk

05:47.700 --> 05:48.530
No, man.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.590
Go... go see your family.

05:49.670 --> 05:50.960
Down, boy, down

05:51.030 --> 05:53.330
You know, maybe you should
just go on home.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.770
Don't worry about what
we do over here.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.140
lt's not even painful anymore.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.200

sex sandwich.

06:11.990 --> 06:12.820

06:12.890 --> 06:14.910

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
with the girls.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.460
Yeah, with the girls.

08:33.530 --> 08:34.520
l-in the living room.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.220
ln the living room, yeah.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.200
Yeah.
They're pretty hot, huh?

08:38.270 --> 08:39.559
Hey, check this out, man.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.970
All this skin comes off with a zipper.
You see?

08:43.039 --> 08:43.900
A-and the harpoons?

08:43.970 --> 08:45.300
Oh, this harpoon hole?

08:45.370 --> 08:47.270
Surgically made
for the illusion.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.330
Dude, it's so hot.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.570
The biggest sexual organ is your
brain.

08:50.650 --> 08:51.980
You know what l mean?

08:54.120 --> 08:54.950
No.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.920
Honestly, don't knock it
until you've tried it.

08:57.990 --> 08:59.610
And getting it on

08:59.690 --> 09:01.780
Well, l'm presently unattached.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.290
l mean, you know...

09:03.360 --> 09:04.550
How do l go about doing that?

09:04.630 --> 09:06.860
Well, you can go dance for them,
see what they say.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.620
l mean, what the hell.
Give it a shot.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.820
Well, l don't dance...

09:09.900 --> 09:10.960
unless l'm totally wasted.

09:11.030 --> 09:11.860
All right, then.

09:11.930 --> 09:12.870
Let's get wasted.

09:26.820 --> 09:31.650
Ali-i-i-i-ve!

09:31.720 --> 09:33.950
That's from the Live Album.

09:34.020 --> 09:38.930
We do not like it

09:38.990 --> 09:41.990
Well, you know, that kind of
means they don't like it, Carl.

09:42.060 --> 09:43.090
Oh, come on!

09:43.170 --> 09:44.560
What do l got to do here?!

09:44.630 --> 09:47.300
Take this knife,
slice off your nipples,

09:47.370 --> 09:49.890
and feed them to the sisters...
like grapes.

09:49.970 --> 09:50.800
All right.

09:50.870 --> 09:51.810
No, l'm not doing that.

09:51.870 --> 09:54.140
Aw, come on, buddy.
You know you're drunk.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.040
Yeah, l know.

09:56.110 --> 09:57.310
lt's a good thing, too.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.370
Otherwise,
l would totally feel this.

09:59.450 --> 10:00.310
Do you have them?

10:00.380 --> 10:01.210
All right.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.750
Now take them and throw them
in the sewer.

10:02.820 --> 10:04.180
l thought that you said...

10:04.250 --> 10:05.190
You thought what?

10:05.250 --> 10:07.020
That you're stupid?
You're so stupid.

10:07.090 --> 10:10.390
That's for hitting me with a
battery at Shea, you asshole.

10:10.460 --> 10:11.550
So...

10:11.630 --> 10:13.220
they don't want the nipples?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.020
Dude, who would want them?

10:15.100 --> 10:18.730
Dogs don't even want them, okay?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.360
All right, John Kruk.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.420
Take it easy, man.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.170
l'll, uh,
catch up with you later.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.030
l found these nipples
in the sewers.

10:29.110 --> 10:31.600
ls anyone you know missing
any nipples?

10:31.680 --> 10:34.110
There's no way they could be
sewed back on.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.450
l mean, too much time has passed
by now.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.750
l don't know nobody, so, uh,
maybe you keep walkin'.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.650
Well, l guess l'll keep looking.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.050
Yeah. Keep lookin'.

10:43.130 --> 10:45.390
Maybe place an ad
in the paper.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.190
lt would be a big color ad.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.820
lt would say "nipples found."

10:49.900 --> 10:53.200
Finally...
nipples of my own.

10:53.270 --> 10:56.700
They're so beautiful

10:56.770 --> 10:58.740
Don't you think l know that?

10:58.810 --> 10:59.640
Ah, that's great.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.470
Couldn't be happier for you.
l have an idea.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.670
How about if l go see my wife
and kids?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.770
l have a better idea.

11:05.850 --> 11:08.840
lt's called "pizza for everyone."

11:08.920 --> 11:11.410
Pizza party!

11:12.990 --> 11:14.850
Who has money?

11:15.220 --> 11:16.320
Dancing is forbidden

11:17.090 --> 11:18.960
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:20.330 --> 11:21.730
Dancing is forbidden

11:22.600 --> 11:24.430
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:25.670 --> 11:27.190
D-d-dancing is forbidden
