00:50.823 --> 00:53.355
- We're not all descended from the Puritans.
- No?

00:53.660 --> 00:56.424
There was another colony,
30 miles from Plymouth.

00:56.729 --> 00:59.107
It's not on the maps today.
Merrymount.

00:59.532 --> 01:01.007
Ah, right,
you mentioned in your book...

01:01.154 --> 01:03.097
The colony where anything goes... went.

01:03.388 --> 01:04.891
There was booze...

01:04.891 --> 01:06.395
There was booze, fornication,
there was music...

01:06.674 --> 01:08.518
They even...

01:09.552 --> 01:10.577
you name it...

01:11.125 --> 01:14.004
They even danced round the Maypole
once a month, wearing masks,

01:14.316 --> 01:17.320
worshiping god knows what, Whites and
Indians together all going for broke.

01:17.737 --> 01:19.270
Who was responsible for all of this?

01:20.144 --> 01:22.409
A character by the name of
Thomas Morton.

01:23.261 --> 01:25.898
Ah... The Hugh Hefner of the Puritans.

01:26.612 --> 01:28.082
You can say that.

01:28.568 --> 01:31.400
I will read you a quote of what the
Puritans thought of

01:31.746 --> 01:33.350
Morton's followers.

01:33.772 --> 01:36.746
"Debauched aliens and atheists
falling into great licentiousness

01:37.085 --> 01:39.568
and leading degenerate lives. "

01:39.975 --> 01:43.290
When I heard that, I packed my bags,
I left Oxford, I came straight to America.

01:43.585 --> 01:44.866
America the licentious.

01:45.226 --> 01:47.340
So what happened
to all of those people?

01:47.668 --> 01:50.650
The Puritans shut them down,
they sent in Miles Standish,

01:50.914 --> 01:53.579
Leading the militia, who chopped down the
Maypole, cut down those coloured ribbons,

01:53.918 --> 01:56.416
Banners everything.
The party was over.

01:56.805 --> 02:00.390
And we became a nation of
strait-laced Puritans.

02:00.891 --> 02:02.229
Well...

02:02.934 --> 02:04.501
Isn't that your point though?

02:04.857 --> 02:06.464
The Puritans won.

02:07.554 --> 02:10.156
They stamped out, all things sexual
How would you say?

02:10.542 --> 02:12.716
- Sexual happiness.
- Exactly.

02:13.976 --> 02:14.949
Until the 1960's.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.295
Until the 1960's, where it all
exploded again all over the place.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.135
Right, everyone was dancing

02:21.483 --> 02:23.153
around the Maypole,

02:23.669 --> 02:26.308
then, "make love, not war".

02:26.693 --> 02:28.514
If you remember,
only a decade earlier,

02:28.919 --> 02:31.996
If you wanted to have sex,
if you wanted to make love in the 1950s,

02:32.300 --> 02:34.564
You had to beg for it,
you had to cop a feel...

02:34.971 --> 02:37.014
Or get married.

02:37.693 --> 02:38.990
As I did in the 1960's.

02:41.024 --> 02:42.163
Any regrets?

02:43.039 --> 02:44.265
Plenty.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.213
But that's my secret.

02:46.718 --> 02:48.923
Don't tell anybody.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.155
That's just between you and me.

03:02.759 --> 03:04.997
I think it was Bette Davis who said:

03:05.307 --> 03:07.696
"Old age is not for sissies"

03:10.119 --> 03:12.947
But it was Tolstoy who said that

03:12.948 --> 03:15.776
"the biggest surprise in
a man's life is old age".

03:17.450 --> 03:19.673
Old age sneaks up on you,

03:20.498 --> 03:24.591
and the next thing you know you're
asking yourself, I'm asking myself,

03:24.939 --> 03:27.405
Why can't an old man act his real age?

03:27.782 --> 03:29.490
How is it possible for
me to still be involved

03:29.874 --> 03:32.751
in the carnal aspects of the human comedy?

03:33.147 --> 03:36.640
Because, in my head,
nothing has changed.

03:58.898 --> 04:01.444
Her name was Consuela Castillo

04:02.135 --> 04:03.982
and she was my student.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.262
This course is called
"Practical Criticism".

04:21.103 --> 04:22.639
So... Let's go!

04:23.314 --> 04:25.281
Right to the big question, shall we?

04:25.746 --> 04:27.691
Does "War and Peace"

04:28.044 --> 04:31.279
become a different book
because we read it?

04:31.970 --> 04:34.438
Yes, of course.
But why?

04:36.815 --> 04:39.538
Because we bring something to the book?

04:39.908 --> 04:41.640
We bring ourselves.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.536
What's more, if you read the book again
in 10 years, it will change again,

04:45.799 --> 04:47.421
because you've changed.

04:47.814 --> 04:50.426
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

04:50.784 --> 04:53.255
I've always been vulnerable
to female beauty,

04:53.583 --> 04:56.503
Ms. Castillo was different,
her posture was perfect.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.948
And she dressed like a
young associate

04:59.347 --> 05:02.660
of a prestigious law firm.
There was a sophistication,

05:03.005 --> 05:04.346
that set her apart.

05:04.919 --> 05:06.923
She knows she's beautiful.

05:07.817 --> 05:10.623
But she's not yet sure what
to do with her beauty.

05:11.304 --> 05:13.287
No, don't take notes.
Because honestly, it's not worth it.

05:13.618 --> 05:15.760
Really, don't give it a thought.

05:18.121 --> 05:21.544
A work of art reminds you of
who you are now.

05:22.529 --> 05:26.476
Since they posted the sexual harassment
hotline number down the hall from my office,

05:26.872 --> 05:29.228
I never make private contact
with any of my students

05:29.229 --> 05:31.585
until they've received their grades.

05:32.729 --> 05:34.200
Afterwards I always throw a cocktail party

05:34.601 --> 05:35.950
for the class.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.667
And it's always a success.

05:45.028 --> 05:47.043
Professor Kepesh,
we saw you on TV last night.

05:47.044 --> 05:49.059
You were great.

05:49.410 --> 05:51.483
Thank you. Charlie Rose was pretty
good too wasn't he?

05:52.155 --> 05:53.998
Well, yes.

05:54.606 --> 05:57.030
- You were great.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.081
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

05:59.991 --> 06:03.124
It's a colossus of perspective. It depends
on who's observing, right professor Kapesh?

06:03.843 --> 06:05.881
Westerners see Islamic integralists as

06:06.535 --> 06:07.815
primitive and dangerous while,

06:08.189 --> 06:10.408
Islamic integralists see
Americans as depraved and corrupt.

06:11.501 --> 06:15.357
Nothing's changed since the crusades.
We need an alliance of civilizations...

06:15.891 --> 06:17.765
- Ms. Castillo.
- Hi, professor.

06:18.626 --> 06:20.758
- Is this a real letter from Kafka?
- Yes.

06:21.271 --> 06:23.757
Yes, it's one of the original letters

06:24.108 --> 06:26.470
that he wrote to Milena.
It was a gift from someone.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.079
Someone close to you.

06:28.382 --> 06:29.660
Someone who was close
to me, Miss Castillo.

06:29.661 --> 06:30.938
Consuela.

06:31.276 --> 06:33.335
We're not in class.
We don't need to be so formal.

06:33.679 --> 06:34.929
Consuela.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.175
- Do you play the piano?
- Yeah.

06:40.557 --> 06:41.679
Would you play for us?

06:42.159 --> 06:44.597
Too many people.
I'd freeze.

06:47.324 --> 06:51.904
You know there's something about you
that invites a kind of formality.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.593
What do you mean?

06:55.147 --> 06:57.638
You have a kind of elegant austerity.

06:58.993 --> 07:00.437
Austerity?

07:00.883 --> 07:02.125
Something like that.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.576
Well, I guess I got that from my father.

07:04.971 --> 07:06.486
He is austere...

07:06.858 --> 07:09.189
and proud.
Very Cuban.

07:09.564 --> 07:10.946
Cuban?

07:11.355 --> 07:12.667
My whole family is Cuban.

07:13.118 --> 07:14.870
I was 11 years old when I came.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.198
Did you go straight to college
from high school?

07:18.029 --> 07:21.138
No, I was a legal secretary
in a law firm.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.278
You worked.

07:23.703 --> 07:25.381
I tried it, but I didn't like it.

07:26.223 --> 07:28.471
My parents always hoped
I would go to college,

07:28.955 --> 07:31.609
So I made up my mind
and here I am.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.783
I want to show you something.

07:40.815 --> 07:43.239
- Here we are.
- Goya.

07:45.751 --> 07:49.150
- What's this one called?
- "La Maja Vestida."

07:50.471 --> 07:51.895
And?

07:52.709 --> 07:55.008
- And?
- She resembles you.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.848
You resemble her.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.394
Really?

08:01.748 --> 08:02.686
Yes.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.583
I think so.

08:07.664 --> 08:08.946
What do you think?

08:09.523 --> 08:11.071
I don't know.

08:14.648 --> 08:16.276
The eyes, maybe.

08:20.494 --> 08:23.760
Why all this talk about Kafka,
Goya and her Cuban family?

08:24.259 --> 08:27.684
Don't get me wrong, it's great that her
family's Cuban and she enjoys my class.

08:28.106 --> 08:31.283
But I go on yakking away mainly
because I want to fuck her.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.961
- What can I say?
- True.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.981
The room is full of spies.

08:37.472 --> 08:39.004
I love music.

08:39.905 --> 08:41.792
Excuse me.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.445
I love opera, my grandfather
takes me to the Opera,

08:47.054 --> 08:48.915
And I adore theater.

08:49.872 --> 08:52.431
I review plays for a magazine.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.448
Would you like to go with me
sometime to the theater?

08:57.367 --> 08:59.217
- Yes.
- Sorry.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.462
Go to the theater?

09:03.903 --> 09:06.580
- Why don't you take her to the prom?
- I get it.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.747
This girl is...

09:09.277 --> 09:13.031
She's a throw-back to a completely
different time. She has to be wooed.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.782
I thought we were talking about sex.

09:16.313 --> 09:18.267
You know for a Pulitzer Prize winning poet,

09:18.632 --> 09:20.720
sometimes you display a
remarkable lack of imagination.

09:21.162 --> 09:23.236
That's why they gave me the fucking prize.

09:23.648 --> 09:27.206
Don't tell me you've never been
through the process of talking the talk.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.190
That's why I have a family for
Christ's sake. I talk to them.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.112
Maybe you should get married again.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.065
George!

09:39.052 --> 09:42.329
Talk the talk with your wife if you
feel like it, go to the museums,

09:42.725 --> 09:44.693
look at all the Goyas that you want,

09:45.084 --> 09:46.738
but keep the sex part just for sex.

09:48.915 --> 09:50.225
Alright.

09:53.215 --> 09:56.007
Do you really still talk
to your wife, George?

09:56.810 --> 09:58.834
No. One all.

10:03.688 --> 10:04.901
I'm not hitting that.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.805
Sneaking off for a smoke?

11:06.987 --> 11:09.069
- You know you shouldn't smoke.
- You tell me that

11:09.481 --> 11:11.414
in this bed, every 3 weeks.

11:12.961 --> 11:15.982
- I'm under a lot of pressure.
- I like to be consistent.

11:16.587 --> 11:17.948
So do I.

11:18.730 --> 11:21.278
You've been trying to get me
to quit smoking for 20 years.

11:21.279 --> 11:23.827
Since the first day of your class.

11:24.276 --> 11:26.816
Oh my God, your class made me smoke.

11:30.819 --> 11:32.360
I'm under a lot of stress.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.688
- Oh, how was Chicago?
- Cleveland.

11:35.049 --> 11:38.176
Chicago was last week.
Atlanta's next week.

11:38.543 --> 11:40.328
You sound like Cary Grant

11:40.654 --> 11:45.900
in "North by Northwest".
Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha!

11:46.500 --> 11:49.801
Ha ha, laugh, just try being a
woman running your own business.

11:50.134 --> 11:52.171
I thought you liked
being your own boss.

11:52.172 --> 11:54.208
I do. Oh, I do, I do.

11:56.337 --> 11:59.052
Thank god for these little interludes.

11:59.488 --> 12:00.913
That's all I can say.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.099
Aren't you going to get that?

12:13.611 --> 12:16.337
There's only one person in the world that
would call me at 2 o'clock in the morning

12:16.894 --> 12:18.230
Leave a message.

12:19.552 --> 12:22.289
Did you get my email?
I really need to talk to you.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.959
Ah, I should have known better than
to think you'd be home at this hour.

12:29.225 --> 12:31.433
Or maybe you are home and listening

12:31.962 --> 12:33.852
to this, all snug and smug.

12:36.475 --> 12:38.514
35 years old and he still hates my guts.

12:38.907 --> 12:40.429
Well, you ran out on him.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.698
I ran out on a marriage that
I got myself into out of youth

12:42.699 --> 12:44.638
and fear a million years ago.

12:44.966 --> 12:46.136
Sometimes you pay for liberation.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.744
That's the price he pays
for being turned into

12:48.175 --> 12:49.901
the heroic...

12:50.513 --> 12:52.189
defender of the abandoned mother.

12:52.644 --> 12:54.733
I mean if any one of us
could make it over the wall.

12:55.198 --> 12:56.777
He sat on my case,

12:57.141 --> 12:59.500
isn't there some statute of limitations?
I've tried.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.223
Really, I've tried.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.498
When he was 12 or 13 one time,

13:04.968 --> 13:06.654
he came to spend the summer
with me, I took him to the Mets.

13:06.981 --> 13:10.111
He spent the next five innings
throwing up in the men's room,

13:10.425 --> 13:11.895
he's been throwing up ever since,
that phone call was him throwing up.

13:11.896 --> 13:13.366
You know what's wild?

13:13.723 --> 13:14.880
He's successful.

13:15.281 --> 13:16.690
Kenny Kepesh,

13:17.061 --> 13:19.569
A well respected doctor,
my son, the doctor.

13:19.922 --> 13:22.797
He speaks passable French,
he's married with children.

13:23.190 --> 13:26.580
It's only with me that he
regresses to what you just heard.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.847
I'm sorry, he gets me going.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.778
I thought you stopped reviewing plays.

13:38.229 --> 13:40.090
Well, that one looked
kind of interesting.

13:43.482 --> 13:45.106
Too bad I'm going to be in Atlanta.

13:45.518 --> 13:47.169
I'll go with George.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.188
Religion, family,

13:50.518 --> 13:53.178
Church, self-help books.

13:53.481 --> 13:56.238
Men with teeth so white you'd think
there's a flashlight in their mouths.

13:56.648 --> 13:59.392
Love, especially romantic love.

14:01.177 --> 14:03.831
Flowers, mini-malls.

14:04.269 --> 14:07.207
There is nothing more
depressing than a mini-mall.

14:07.443 --> 14:09.439
- Mini-malls.
- Except perhaps

14:09.927 --> 14:14.315
your flaws, your vices,
your mortgages,

14:15.402 --> 14:18.523
your furtive looks to your
sleeping BlackBerry

14:19.012 --> 14:20.618
- I do like blackberries.
- And this man,

14:21.152 --> 14:25.858
who finds himself here,
dandruff falling of his head.

14:27.353 --> 14:28.993
That was wonderful.

14:30.261 --> 14:31.695
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

14:32.007 --> 14:33.354
Thank you.

14:35.963 --> 14:38.061
You'd like to go somewhere for a drink?

14:41.370 --> 14:43.308
We don't have to...

14:46.263 --> 14:49.815
I'm just not used to being
out with a celebrity.

14:50.217 --> 14:52.344
Talking about literature on
public television once a week,

14:52.345 --> 14:54.472
and writing the occasional review

14:54.809 --> 14:57.436
for the New Yorker, doesn't
make me much of a celebrity.

14:57.872 --> 15:02.410
Don't forget your history books
"The Origins of American Hedonism."

15:03.033 --> 15:06.034
Look, if you don't like the
idea of being stared at,

15:06.426 --> 15:08.289
We can go to my place.

15:08.704 --> 15:11.142
Then the only person
staring would be me.

15:20.161 --> 15:23.615
If I go to your place will you
do something for me?

16:18.190 --> 16:19.283
That was awful.

16:19.805 --> 16:23.524
It was OK.
That was amazing.

16:24.335 --> 16:26.449
I wish I could play.

16:26.878 --> 16:28.065
Take lessons.

16:28.563 --> 16:30.698
You'd enjoy playing if

16:30.699 --> 16:32.834
you knew you wouldn't have such
a high opinion of my playing.

16:33.299 --> 16:35.206
Now you're fishing for compliments.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.324
Is this a metronome?

16:37.836 --> 16:40.059
It's like a heart beat.

16:40.444 --> 16:41.851
Even...

16:42.223 --> 16:46.180
great pianists have a problem
with their core acceleration.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.260
You're a very charming man.

16:57.403 --> 16:59.420
You know, don't you?

17:00.095 --> 17:05.186
If this is all for showing you a metronome,
I swear I didn't invent it.

17:35.384 --> 17:39.754
Can you find anyone that
enchanting without sex?

17:40.542 --> 17:42.598
Nobody.

17:46.226 --> 17:47.466
What is this?

17:49.274 --> 17:50.945
My dark room.

17:53.401 --> 17:55.586
I used to develop my own pictures.

17:56.069 --> 17:58.557
- You don't anymore?
- No, no time.

17:59.477 --> 18:04.182
I should go digital, but I can't
really understand that stuff.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.684
Of course you can.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.297
Thank you.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.839
Something relates little princess
because she's...

18:22.179 --> 18:24.181
the center of the picture,

18:24.620 --> 18:28.354
Not her parents,
The queen and the king.

18:29.461 --> 18:31.135
They are just...

18:31.654 --> 18:34.080
ghostly reflections in the mirror.

19:56.917 --> 20:00.183
Well she must have been curious
about going to bed with you.

20:00.791 --> 20:02.572
Yes, so she could tell
her girlfriends

20:03.015 --> 20:05.651
what a man of our age,

20:06.152 --> 20:07.459
is like, close up.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.558
I'm merely an experience for her.
One of many to come.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.797
She'll remember me as...

20:13.237 --> 20:16.283
the old guy who gave her
some culture on the way.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.565
Well, that sounds about right.

20:19.015 --> 20:21.172
You should chalk it up to
the same thing, right?

20:22.362 --> 20:23.849
Yeah.

20:25.101 --> 20:28.353
Gotta stop worrying about growing old.

20:28.825 --> 20:31.321
Worry about growing up.

20:33.832 --> 20:38.104
Oh, thank your lucky stars for
such a one-shot encounter.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.547
It wasn't a one-shot encounter.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.639
She came back for more?

21:28.337 --> 21:31.097
You have the most beautiful
breasts I've ever seen.

21:34.869 --> 21:36.148
You like them?

21:38.116 --> 21:39.631
I worship them.

21:48.586 --> 21:50.540
And you have a beautiful face,

21:52.869 --> 21:55.437
I can't stop looking at.

21:56.244 --> 21:57.871
You know something?

22:01.602 --> 22:03.651
You're a work of art.

22:07.811 --> 22:09.668
A work of art.

22:15.531 --> 22:17.792
A real work of art.

22:35.305 --> 22:36.974
Let's talk about you.

22:40.558 --> 22:42.121
Have you had many women?

22:43.271 --> 22:44.535
Why?

22:45.180 --> 22:47.945
More than 50 or less?

22:49.790 --> 22:50.949
More.

22:52.655 --> 22:54.200
Who's counting?

22:56.211 --> 22:57.618
How about you?

22:59.620 --> 23:00.993
Not many.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.651
How many?

23:18.239 --> 23:19.363
Five.

23:21.178 --> 23:22.675
Five boyfriends.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.006
Five.

23:25.552 --> 23:26.837
Five.

23:30.323 --> 23:31.600
I see.

23:34.588 --> 23:35.993
So, who were they?

23:36.383 --> 23:38.697
They were young, right?
Younger than me?

23:39.107 --> 23:42.523
Of course they were younger.
They were boys.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.554
Boys?

23:45.235 --> 23:46.731
Sure.

23:52.806 --> 23:56.863
You want to know the most
extreme thing I ever did?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.138
Hmm well...

23:59.809 --> 24:03.060
Once I went to bed
with two guys together.

24:04.246 --> 24:06.237
Two together?

24:06.753 --> 24:10.045
They were my childhood
friends and...

24:10.615 --> 24:12.828
that's how we ended up one night.

24:13.249 --> 24:16.881
The three of us were drunk and
we ended up in bed together.

24:18.217 --> 24:19.752
All three of you?

24:21.274 --> 24:22.911
Well, when you're 17,

24:23.285 --> 24:27.801
You do a lot of things just to feel
secure and emotional.

24:28.319 --> 24:29.943
Right.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.348
Consuela.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.861
My whole life was
dedicated to independence

25:24.862 --> 25:27.533
and at some cost I had achieved my goal.

25:27.987 --> 25:30.226
Nevertheless, it was in that moment,

25:31.392 --> 25:34.602
That my terrible jealousy was born.

25:35.017 --> 25:37.280
That is when I realised that
I would never, ever,

25:37.673 --> 25:40.911
really possess her.

25:41.353 --> 25:43.629
I feel anxious unless I speak
to her on the phone every day,

25:43.959 --> 25:46.424
and then I feel anxious
after we've spoken.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.869
What are you wearing?

25:50.852 --> 25:52.589
Where are you?

25:57.604 --> 26:00.215
I knew it's only a matter of time

26:00.216 --> 26:02.826
before a young man found
her and took her away.

26:06.616 --> 26:07.937
I knew.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.795
Because I was once that young
man who would have done it.

26:37.449 --> 26:39.528
Well, at least does
it makes you feel young?

26:39.529 --> 26:41.607
It's like playing soccer
with a bunch of 20 year olds.

26:41.963 --> 26:45.163
It doesn't make you feel 20 because
you're playing with huge difference,

26:45.513 --> 26:47.106
every second of the game.

26:47.796 --> 26:49.319
You have to leave her.

26:49.638 --> 26:52.010
Your hands will always be
tied by this girl.

26:52.355 --> 26:54.652
She's going to leave you
sooner or later, anyway.

26:55.028 --> 26:57.635
So it's always better to
keep one step ahead.

26:58.856 --> 27:00.982
Take her to a nice romantic spot

27:01.637 --> 27:03.464
tell her it's over.

27:03.869 --> 27:05.310
That's what I'd do.

27:10.137 --> 27:14.095
My parents talk about all these
places they wanted to go to.

27:14.626 --> 27:18.342
They have all the money to go
wherever they want, but...

27:18.833 --> 27:21.546
leaving Cuba was their first
and last trip.

27:23.619 --> 27:25.474
I don't want my life to be like that.

27:25.781 --> 27:27.679
Let me take you places.

27:28.032 --> 27:30.440
<i>What the hell are you saying?
You brought her here to say goodbye.</i>

27:30.719 --> 27:32.359
- Where would we go?
- Europe.

27:32.690 --> 27:36.662
We could go to Paris this summer,
or Rome, or Madrid.

27:36.975 --> 27:40.723
We can visit the Prado and see the
real Velasquez, the real Goya.

27:41.128 --> 27:43.034
<i>The Prado?</i>

27:43.415 --> 27:45.086
Do you mean it?

27:46.008 --> 27:47.760
Of course I meant it.

27:48.441 --> 27:51.664
And we can finish our trip in Venice,
you'll love Venice.

27:55.178 --> 27:58.143
- And you would ride a gondola with me.
- Maybe.

27:59.392 --> 28:00.688
Maybe.

28:02.641 --> 28:05.047
"Maybe" may be your favorite word.

28:06.822 --> 28:09.048
I'll sing to you in the gondola.

28:12.301 --> 28:13.628
We'll see.

28:25.443 --> 28:26.420
What's this from:

28:26.421 --> 28:29.398
"They're making a beast with two backs".
What's that from?

28:30.045 --> 28:31.563
William Shakespeare!

28:32.073 --> 28:34.142
"Othello, The Moor of Venice".

28:34.636 --> 28:37.903
And we're making a monster
with four legs.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.790
Where shall we have dinner?

28:41.236 --> 28:42.805
I can't, I'm going out tonight.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.164
- You are? With whom?
- With my brother.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.079
We're going to go dancing
to that place "Kalimas".

28:48.494 --> 28:50.219
Your brother...?

28:52.144 --> 28:54.307
You never mentioned a brother.

28:54.932 --> 28:57.371
Well, there is a lot of things
you don't know about me yet.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.657
Thank you.

29:13.758 --> 29:15.300
Here we are.

29:17.651 --> 29:19.926
I really had a great
time with you today.

29:20.674 --> 29:22.102
Me too.

29:29.002 --> 29:30.226
Thank you.

29:39.980 --> 29:40.806
Bye.

29:42.109 --> 29:43.116
Bye.

29:51.669 --> 29:53.933
Are you really going out with
your brother tonight?

29:55.486 --> 29:56.660
David!

29:57.060 --> 29:58.434
That was a joke.

29:59.462 --> 30:00.432
Bye.

30:18.956 --> 30:22.469
On the nights she isn't
with me I am deformed,

30:23.350 --> 30:25.770
thinking of where she might be.

30:27.415 --> 30:30.472
And all this because this girl
will tell me a thousand times

30:30.893 --> 30:33.848
how much she adores me and means it.

30:35.596 --> 30:39.004
This girl will never once tell
me she yearns for my cock.

31:56.503 --> 31:57.721
How are you?

31:58.835 --> 32:00.160
What are you doing here?

32:01.304 --> 32:03.132
I was on my way to see a friend,

32:03.665 --> 32:06.208
who lives near here.
How's things?

32:06.794 --> 32:08.057
What's the matter?

32:09.021 --> 32:11.555
- Did you came here to check on me?
- I told you.

32:11.885 --> 32:14.256
I was down in the neighborhood
and I saw this place.

32:15.998 --> 32:18.011
Do you want to ruin everything?

32:20.774 --> 32:21.843
No.

32:22.556 --> 32:25.839
So then you're going to have
to start trusting me.

32:28.542 --> 32:29.685
I'll call you tomorrow.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.072
No, I'll call you.

32:55.752 --> 32:59.385
I never behaved like such an
idiot even when I was her age.

32:59.846 --> 33:01.910
Good thing is, at least now,

33:02.304 --> 33:06.003
it's finished, she won't want to
see me anymore. I understand her.

33:06.407 --> 33:08.862
I mean, even I wouldn't want to
see me anymore if I was her.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.666
Maybe it's just as well.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.835
- Yes.
- Just as well.

33:17.606 --> 33:19.539
Oh, my God.

33:35.876 --> 33:36.681
Hello?

33:37.166 --> 33:38.772
David, it's Consuela.

33:44.237 --> 33:46.119
During the last two days

33:46.502 --> 33:48.159
I've been thinking a bit about us.

33:48.502 --> 33:49.909
Have you?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.926
Yes.

33:53.926 --> 33:56.178
And what were you thinking?

33:59.307 --> 34:00.949
That it's all over.

34:01.367 --> 34:03.663
What do you really want from me?

34:04.274 --> 34:05.609
What do I really want from you?

34:08.725 --> 34:10.139
You spend you whole life

34:10.678 --> 34:14.496
going through relationships without

34:14.851 --> 34:16.859
ever really bonding with anyone.

34:19.134 --> 34:20.606
So, at least I would like to know,

34:20.917 --> 34:22.710
who I am for you.

34:28.966 --> 34:32.358
The fact that you're jealous and
possessive doesn't help me, at all.

34:34.313 --> 34:37.875
Even little kids are jealous of their
toys until they get tired of them.

34:38.185 --> 34:39.565
and want new ones. So...

34:40.610 --> 34:43.577
is that how it's going
to be between us two?

34:49.915 --> 34:51.953
Have you ever imagined...

34:55.572 --> 34:57.837
a future with me?

35:00.565 --> 35:03.095
A future with you scares me.

35:05.141 --> 35:07.116
- It scares you?
- Yes.

35:09.478 --> 35:10.497
Why?

35:20.185 --> 35:24.027
Because, there's a 30 odd
year age difference

35:24.459 --> 35:27.667
between you and me,

35:28.072 --> 35:30.683
and you have your whole
life ahead of you.

35:31.061 --> 35:34.070
It's just a matter of time
before you realise it too.

35:34.462 --> 35:38.915
I didn't ask you what I was going to do,
I asked what you wanted to do with me.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.344
When you make love to a woman you
get revenge for all the things

35:54.702 --> 35:57.084
that defeated you in life.

36:40.396 --> 36:44.273
I spent my whole life jumping
from one relationship to another,

36:44.669 --> 36:50.422
because this made me believe that I was
never alone, and that time was not passing.

36:54.136 --> 36:56.532
I've always surmised,
for example,

36:57.994 --> 37:00.653
that D.H. Lawrence, when he was writing

37:01.012 --> 37:03.075
"Lady Chatterley's Lover"...

37:03.497 --> 37:05.762
"Who am I for you?",
she asked me one day.

37:06.087 --> 37:08.860
I was to afraid to ask
who I was for her.

37:12.645 --> 37:15.424
How long could it have lasted?

37:25.817 --> 37:27.063
Surprise.

37:35.006 --> 37:36.930
Yes. Let me... wow!

37:41.331 --> 37:43.549
Thank God for Carolyn.

38:16.964 --> 38:22.495
Carolyn is my only point of contact
with the self-confident man I used to be.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.719
How was that play?

38:35.830 --> 38:37.065
Which play?

38:38.361 --> 38:40.720
The one you took George to.

38:41.305 --> 38:43.679
Oh, unremarkable, just...

38:49.289 --> 38:50.677
Here I go.

38:51.146 --> 38:52.676
Oh, hit and run.

38:53.084 --> 38:54.411
Just the way you like it.

38:54.825 --> 38:57.206
Good thing I don't have pets.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.113
Only you.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.791
Which one was Carlos Alonzo?

39:18.065 --> 39:21.080
- From high school.
- What was his thing?

39:21.361 --> 39:23.425
What did he want you to do?

39:30.092 --> 39:31.296
He liked...

39:31.655 --> 39:33.800
to watch me menstruate.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.715
What?

39:38.090 --> 39:40.704
- He liked to watch me menstruate.
- I don't believe this.

39:41.021 --> 39:44.421
The respectable Cuban-American girl
whose parents worship Ronald Reagan,

39:44.737 --> 39:48.361
who enforce an 8 o'clock curfew on their
daughter, in summer time, no less,

39:48.736 --> 39:51.187
there she is in high school,
aged 15...

39:51.609 --> 39:52.485
16.

39:53.068 --> 39:55.740
I'm so sorry.
That makes all the difference.

39:57.235 --> 40:00.479
- I think you're being ridiculous.
- How did you manage it?

40:00.924 --> 40:01.914
David...

40:02.457 --> 40:03.960
I'm really curious.
What do you do?

40:04.331 --> 40:06.971
You find yourself having your period,
pick up a phone, you ask him to come over?

40:07.323 --> 40:08.928
"Hey Carlos, I'm starting."

40:09.388 --> 40:11.817
And then he appears,
all Cuban and "respectable",

40:12.146 --> 40:14.366
And the pair of you retire to the
bathroom where you have the ceremony

40:14.630 --> 40:16.191
of the pulling down of the tampon.

40:17.538 --> 40:19.902
Yeah, it's just like you were there.

40:22.177 --> 40:23.556
Just filling in...

40:23.945 --> 40:27.306
the missing...
just filling in the blanks.

40:27.994 --> 40:29.467
Which blanks?

40:29.886 --> 40:31.996
Five. Now we're down to 3.

40:32.384 --> 40:35.104
Because of the two guys who...

40:35.515 --> 40:37.105
I have to go, sorry.

40:42.512 --> 40:44.262
What is this?

40:44.657 --> 40:46.464
- What?
- This.

40:49.277 --> 40:51.553
You're fucking other women.

40:52.515 --> 40:55.075
I had two husbands who
fucked other women.

40:55.396 --> 40:58.841
I didn't like it then, I don't
like it now, least of all with you.

40:59.123 --> 41:02.763
You have everything with me David.
Pure fucking.

41:03.125 --> 41:05.946
No hidden agendas,
No icky entanglements.

41:06.252 --> 41:09.297
How could you do this?
There aren't many like me.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.079
I actually understand you.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.410
I am one in a million.

41:15.883 --> 41:17.570
How could you possibly fuck...?

41:17.946 --> 41:18.976
I don't know whose that is.

41:19.429 --> 41:21.044
Why don't you put it
on a bagel and eat it.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.659
I have a pretty good idea.

41:24.488 --> 41:25.612
I'm sure you do.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.973
You know my friend
George O'Hearn, the poet?

41:28.284 --> 41:30.352
George uses tampons?
Since when?

41:31.115 --> 41:33.208
No, listen. George...

41:33.584 --> 41:36.884
has the keys to this apartment.
He gives poetry readings, he meets girls.

41:37.291 --> 41:40.212
He can't bring them home,
to his wife in New Rochelle.

41:40.602 --> 41:42.184
And since he's always short on funds...

41:42.530 --> 41:45.196
- And since some of them are married...
- George fucks all these women in your bed?

41:45.497 --> 41:47.868
Not all, some.
He uses the bed in the guest room.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.253
His marriage isn't paradise.

41:50.254 --> 41:52.200
Probably a bit like mine and he
wasn't desperate enough to get out.

41:52.575 --> 41:54.666
I don't believe a fucking
word you're saying.

41:55.190 --> 41:57.425
Everything in your life
is so meticulous.

41:57.801 --> 42:01.075
- It's so orderly...
- I don't know whose tampon this is.

42:03.018 --> 42:04.482
You have to believe me.

42:06.580 --> 42:09.160
You're all I'm holding on to.

42:10.346 --> 42:12.437
<i>In this at least I was
telling the truth.</i>

42:36.295 --> 42:38.160
<i>Of course the whole situation
was ridiculous.</i>

43:06.269 --> 43:07.277
Do I snore?

43:09.078 --> 43:10.822
- Yes?
- It's worse.

43:12.276 --> 43:13.575
What?

43:14.749 --> 43:16.052
Well...

43:16.424 --> 43:17.920
You drool.

43:18.544 --> 43:19.466
Yes.

43:19.986 --> 43:21.383
- You drool on...
- Not true!

43:21.640 --> 43:22.763
You drool in your sleep.

43:23.435 --> 43:26.061
Beautiful women are invisible.

43:26.488 --> 43:28.672
Invisible?
What the hell does that mean?

43:39.626 --> 43:40.864
Invisible.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.612
They jump out at you. A beautiful
woman stands out... stands apart

43:45.491 --> 43:49.254
- You can't miss her.
- But we never actually see the person.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.506
We see the beautiful shell.

43:51.897 --> 43:54.599
We're blocked by the beauty barrier.

43:57.521 --> 43:59.448
Look at you.

44:10.463 --> 44:11.700
What?

44:12.760 --> 44:14.184
What did you say?

44:17.465 --> 44:20.353
- You're deaf, Mr Kepesh.
- No. What?

44:20.822 --> 44:23.373
Or maybe you do not want to hear.

44:23.779 --> 44:26.182
Maybe that's the problem with you.

44:39.482 --> 44:44.454
Yes. We're so dazzled by the outside,
we never make it inside.

44:53.914 --> 44:56.020
Do you always work in black and white?

44:56.582 --> 45:00.127
Mainly.
I like the theatricality.

45:00.954 --> 45:02.696
Is that how you see the world?

45:03.503 --> 45:04.835
In black and white?

45:05.194 --> 45:06.535
No.

45:07.488 --> 45:10.448
That distinction belongs to my son.

45:12.196 --> 45:14.835
You always speak of him
with such bitterness.

45:16.180 --> 45:19.293
In my family,
that would be so strange.

45:19.978 --> 45:21.636
Take a look.

45:28.015 --> 45:29.530
Beautiful picture.

45:30.749 --> 45:32.393
Beautiful woman.

45:33.847 --> 45:36.058
Look, my hands are huge.

45:37.670 --> 45:39.491
I want you so much.

45:45.017 --> 45:46.425
David...

45:48.111 --> 45:49.614
Your fridge is empty.

45:51.299 --> 45:53.175
If we are staying in,

45:54.943 --> 45:57.430
we have to go shopping.

46:00.878 --> 46:03.659
Excuse me, Professor,
but your Spanish is awful.

46:04.159 --> 46:06.395
- Then teach me.
- Yeah, I'll teach you.

46:07.522 --> 46:08.866
I'll teach you "mañana".

46:13.628 --> 46:16.417
- Isn't that your poet friend?
- Keep walking.

46:21.521 --> 46:24.270
- That woman is not his wife?
- That's right.

46:26.275 --> 46:28.398
- I find that disgusting.
- It isn't our business.

46:28.819 --> 46:31.399
- And that's the end of it?
- Let's not discuss it here.

46:32.164 --> 46:34.711
- Are you OK with that?
- With what?

46:36.649 --> 46:39.636
For all you know he's just having
a cup of coffee with a friend.

46:40.060 --> 46:41.469
You know,
you're jumping to conclusions.

46:41.923 --> 46:45.557
David, being younger than you
doesn't make me a child.

46:45.917 --> 46:48.389
In any event, it's not our business.

46:48.814 --> 46:50.986
You keep saying that,
but what do you think about it?

46:53.184 --> 46:55.129
What I think is...

46:55.677 --> 46:57.563
that marriage...

46:57.981 --> 47:00.547
is a problematic institution at best.

47:01.189 --> 47:03.023
Which is why you married your wife.

47:03.443 --> 47:05.154
Which is why I don't cheat on her.

47:05.561 --> 47:10.156
- But you were married once.
- Yes, yes! Yes! Yes!

47:11.186 --> 47:12.499
What do you want me to say?

47:13.016 --> 47:14.551
I was married.

47:15.093 --> 47:16.736
It was a mistake.

47:17.503 --> 47:18.849
Did you try?

47:19.316 --> 47:22.521
Did you really try?
Where I come from...

47:24.068 --> 47:27.333
I know, where you come from the
rules are different, but they're not.

47:32.362 --> 47:34.364
You're such a cynic.

47:34.818 --> 47:36.913
I'm such a realist.

47:37.832 --> 47:39.630
I think you're just infantile.

47:40.108 --> 47:42.260
I'm sure you're right.

47:51.204 --> 47:54.664
I hung in there for over a year.
It was a real roller coaster ride.

47:55.079 --> 47:57.617
And like all rides,
sooner or later, it has to end.

48:06.453 --> 48:08.357
What are you doing a
week from Sunday?

48:09.280 --> 48:10.518
I don't know. Why?

48:10.844 --> 48:11.776
Something to drink?

48:13.060 --> 48:15.520
- Yeah, two Bellinis, please.
- Okay.

48:16.233 --> 48:18.312
What's a week from Sunday?

48:18.794 --> 48:20.563
My parents are throwing
me a graduation party,

48:20.892 --> 48:23.124
to celebrate my MFA.

48:24.125 --> 48:25.943
I'd like you to come.

48:28.961 --> 48:29.865
David...

48:30.457 --> 48:31.594
Everyone knows about you.

48:32.132 --> 48:34.115
For a whole year and half

48:34.116 --> 48:36.098
they've been asking me about
this mystery man I'm seeing.

48:36.691 --> 48:39.569
They're going to start thinking
I'm with some drug dealer,

48:39.852 --> 48:41.145
if you don't stop hiding.

48:41.479 --> 48:42.961
I'm not hiding.

48:44.372 --> 48:47.183
- You didn't come to my birthday.
- Well you didn't ask me.

48:47.834 --> 48:51.787
I asked you to Christmas dinner
with my parents. You had plans.

48:52.129 --> 48:54.520
Then I invited you to Thanksgiving
dinner, you couldn't come.

48:54.928 --> 48:57.591
Whoa, Thanksgiving I really couldn't.

49:11.610 --> 49:12.972
David...

49:13.417 --> 49:14.311
Huh?

49:14.718 --> 49:16.782
I want you to meet my family.

49:17.183 --> 49:18.967
But I'm not going to insist.

49:19.453 --> 49:22.550
I just want you to say yes
because you want to come.

49:23.910 --> 49:26.642
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

49:27.187 --> 49:28.620
Enjoy.

49:31.359 --> 49:32.568
Listen to me.

49:34.521 --> 49:36.116
Listen to me.

49:41.114 --> 49:43.203
When I come to your party,

49:44.109 --> 49:46.212
you have to promise to do something.

49:51.518 --> 49:52.737
What?

49:53.509 --> 49:55.784
Don't take your eyes of me,

49:56.239 --> 49:58.411
When the Cubanates come,

49:58.785 --> 50:01.473
Stampeding towards me.

50:04.776 --> 50:06.255
That's all?

50:06.613 --> 50:07.928
That's all.

50:09.655 --> 50:11.022
Okay.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.037
So...

50:13.947 --> 50:16.638
- That means yes?
- That means yes.

50:18.210 --> 50:19.243
Okay.

50:35.122 --> 50:37.170
I'm happy.

50:38.845 --> 50:39.926
Good.

50:40.406 --> 50:42.328
And now the food.

50:46.888 --> 50:48.342
Her parents will be there, I hope,

50:48.710 --> 50:50.454
grandparents will be there,

50:51.687 --> 50:55.689
Cuban relatives, all her childhood
friends... and who knows,

50:56.066 --> 50:59.954
Carlos Alonso and the two guys who
made her the meat of their sandwich.

51:00.330 --> 51:01.907
And I'll be introduced as...

51:02.210 --> 51:04.312
"The Teacher Who's on Television."

51:05.582 --> 51:06.783
What's wrong with that?

51:07.161 --> 51:09.803
What's wrong is I'll be
judged for my age.

51:10.267 --> 51:12.026
They'll say all the horrible
things they say in these cases.

51:12.365 --> 51:14.556
She's with me because she
wants something in return,

51:14.835 --> 51:17.668
and I'm with her
because I like new girls.

51:18.022 --> 51:19.130
Pathetic.

51:19.569 --> 51:22.211
It's about time to face your situation.
That's what I think.

51:27.134 --> 51:29.057
Who is Carlos Alonso?

51:30.869 --> 51:32.122
Some guy.

51:38.715 --> 51:40.404
- Hello?
- Hi.

51:40.787 --> 51:42.843
- Did I wake you up?
- No, I was reading.

51:45.128 --> 51:48.283
I just wanted to say goodnight...

51:49.219 --> 51:51.281
and tell you how happy I am that
you're going to come tomorrow

51:51.779 --> 51:55.520
and how important it is for me.

51:56.344 --> 51:57.953
And for me too.

51:59.210 --> 52:00.459
Okay.

52:01.006 --> 52:02.136
See you then.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.034
See you then.

52:04.333 --> 52:06.331
- Good night.
- Good night.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.446
- Consuela...
- David, where are you?

53:11.861 --> 53:14.129
You won't believe what
just happened, my...

53:14.516 --> 53:17.266
I'm stuck on the
George Washington bridge.

53:19.018 --> 53:20.803
My car's broken down.

53:22.986 --> 53:24.690
Consuela?

53:28.337 --> 53:30.081
I called AAA.

53:30.566 --> 53:32.881
They say they're going to
be at least an hour.

53:33.337 --> 53:36.748
And then they're going to have to get
me off the bridge and tow me some place.

53:37.168 --> 53:40.184
I'll call you right after, Okay?

53:40.773 --> 53:42.428
Consuela?

53:44.421 --> 53:46.615
Why are you doing this to me?

53:49.305 --> 53:50.774
Consuela?

53:53.045 --> 53:54.272
Hello?

54:50.213 --> 54:52.290
One new message.

54:52.968 --> 54:54.869
First new message...

54:55.811 --> 54:58.389
I saw you today on television,

54:58.765 --> 55:00.723
playing the wise old man

55:01.153 --> 55:02.341
who knows everything.

55:02.970 --> 55:04.891
The one who always knows better.

55:05.484 --> 55:08.138
The one who knows what's good culture,
and what people should read,

55:10.520 --> 55:13.859
and all about music
all about art...

55:16.095 --> 55:18.271
You know so many things.

55:21.049 --> 55:23.457
But I'm here,
trying to celebrate

55:24.163 --> 55:28.271
this important moment
of my life.

55:28.930 --> 55:31.771
And I decide to have a party
and I want to have you here.

55:33.949 --> 55:34.947
Why?

55:36.057 --> 55:37.912
Why, Consuela, why?

55:40.581 --> 55:44.378
Because you mean
everything to me.

55:46.276 --> 55:47.964
You do.

55:48.671 --> 55:51.795
But, anyway, you are not here.

55:53.244 --> 55:56.648
I just wanted you to know something...

55:58.528 --> 56:00.917
that I loved you.

56:02.090 --> 56:04.327
Very much.

56:05.589 --> 56:08.281
Very, very much.

56:39.112 --> 56:40.315
Consuela?

56:40.878 --> 56:42.823
It's me. Open up.

56:43.301 --> 56:45.866
- Kenny.
- Come on, open up.

57:13.860 --> 57:15.249
Hello.

57:16.262 --> 57:18.141
Why are all the lights off?

57:37.605 --> 57:39.088
I'm having an affair.

57:42.636 --> 57:44.638
Did you hear what I just said?

57:45.216 --> 57:46.567
You!

57:48.357 --> 57:50.653
- Is that all that you have to say?
- Congratulations.

57:50.984 --> 57:51.956
Congratulations...

57:52.372 --> 57:53.459
You're a riot, you know that?

57:54.111 --> 57:56.390
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what to say.

57:58.705 --> 57:59.920
This is awful.

58:01.469 --> 58:02.646
I'm coming apart.

58:03.177 --> 58:05.609
I thought you were happily married,
you always told me you were happily married.

58:05.925 --> 58:07.453
- I am.
- Well...

58:07.875 --> 58:10.859
Forgive me, but I can't see how
that can be entirely true.

58:11.299 --> 58:13.770
Anyway, you don't look
terribly happy right now.

58:14.316 --> 58:16.473
- But you don't understand.
- Kenny...

58:16.837 --> 58:19.065
I'm trying to understand.
You're having an affair.

58:19.528 --> 58:22.801
So you come here, because,
what, I'm the expert.

58:23.213 --> 58:25.882
There's no-one else to talk to.

58:26.199 --> 58:27.786
I'm sorry.

58:28.475 --> 58:29.897
What you going to do?

58:31.451 --> 58:32.773
I don't know.

58:36.293 --> 58:37.796
Would you like something to drink?

58:41.026 --> 58:42.391
What will you have?

58:42.849 --> 58:46.409
Glenfiddich, bourbon, vodka,
Cointreau, Grand Marnier,

58:46.733 --> 58:48.150
Armagnac...

58:49.015 --> 58:50.718
No. Diet coke.

58:50.997 --> 58:52.404
Diet coke it is.

58:54.108 --> 58:57.477
This isn't some kind of irresponsible fling.

58:57.916 --> 59:01.557
I love Lisa, I really do,
and the kids are my whole life.

59:02.980 --> 59:04.435
Knowing you,

59:04.901 --> 59:07.422
it's probably simplest if you
just break off the other...

59:08.101 --> 59:09.312
Oh, I can't.

59:09.970 --> 59:12.442
This woman is...

59:12.801 --> 59:14.892
like no-one else on earth.

59:15.297 --> 59:17.954
I've never felt so alive,
so full of energy.

59:18.303 --> 59:20.048
And she's a great person.

59:20.502 --> 59:22.767
She has degrees in
chemistry and art history.

59:22.768 --> 59:25.032
She plays the oboe, for chrissakes.

59:25.485 --> 59:26.880
And her kids are...

59:27.240 --> 59:29.517
- fabulous
- She has children?

59:29.801 --> 59:32.489
Three. Scott, little Shawn...

59:32.924 --> 59:36.396
Hold on Kenny! What are we talking
about here? Her children or your adultery?

59:36.659 --> 59:38.436
- Don't call it that.
- Well, what would you call it?

59:38.786 --> 59:42.646
See, you sound like Lisa. You try to
over-simplify a complicated situation.

59:43.786 --> 59:44.605
I...

59:45.052 --> 59:46.395
I'm committed to this relationship,

59:46.738 --> 59:49.165
unlike you, who's terrified
of committing to anyone.

59:49.569 --> 59:51.899
Dana is a real person

59:51.900 --> 59:54.229
so don't equate what's happening
to me with your serial tom-catting.

59:54.525 --> 59:56.698
- What have I got to do with it?
- Plenty!

59:57.307 --> 59:58.448
Anyway,

59:58.870 --> 01:00:03.010
Dana isn't one of your little
star-struck students.

01:00:05.782 --> 01:00:07.811
If you want my advice,

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:10.369
Lisa mustn't know a word of this,

01:00:10.935 --> 01:00:13.456
- until you've made up your mind...
- Lisa already knows.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:15.577
Why on earth did you tell Lisa?

01:00:15.952 --> 01:00:18.920
- You expect me to lie to my wife?
- Now you can't retreat even if you want to.

01:00:20.906 --> 01:00:21.984
God!

01:00:22.607 --> 01:00:25.365
I don't know why I came here. I don't
know what help you could possibly be.

01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:27.295
Except maybe, maybe...

01:00:29.239 --> 01:00:31.253
I hoped that you might relate to me,

01:00:32.217 --> 01:00:33.669
as a father...

01:00:34.084 --> 01:00:36.382
- for just once.
- I don't know how to relate to you.

01:00:36.782 --> 01:00:38.627
You're so morally superior
to me in every way.

01:00:38.628 --> 01:00:40.473
Even our adulteries can't compare.

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:42.771
Yours plays the oboe, what have I
got to put up against that

01:00:43.235 --> 01:00:45.477
She probably writes poetry in her
spare time, and her kids do too.

01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:47.004
You're such a jerk.

01:00:47.005 --> 01:00:48.317
However, if you are,
as you say, committed...

01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:50.158
You're going to have to end your marriage.

01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:53.205
How can I? If I walk out on
Lisa and the kids...

01:00:53.556 --> 01:00:56.445
If I do what you did,
then I'll destroy them.

01:00:56.761 --> 01:00:59.960
Why do you say that? You survived.
Your mother survived.

01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:02.396
Are you trying to tell me

01:01:02.869 --> 01:01:07.451
that you did the morally correct
thing by walking out on us?

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.467
It was honest.

01:01:09.818 --> 01:01:10.961
God!

01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:19.953
- I'm leaving.
- There's the door.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.094
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:42.869
<i>Consuela didn't call the next day.</i>

01:01:46.122 --> 01:01:48.441
<i>and not even the day after.</i>

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:53.295
<i>She never called again.</i>

01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:17.246
You've gotta eat something.

01:02:18.964 --> 01:02:21.154
You gotta get out of this fucking bed.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.876
- I ruined everything, George.
- You didn't ruin anything.

01:02:25.434 --> 01:02:27.560
It just came to its natural end.

01:02:28.154 --> 01:02:29.051
You were her teacher,

01:02:29.358 --> 01:02:31.301
her big growing-up experience.

01:02:31.817 --> 01:02:34.404
You called the whole thing from day one.

01:02:35.236 --> 01:02:37.234
It was bound to end
sooner or later. Eat.

01:02:37.643 --> 01:02:38.551
I miss her.

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:41.193
Well, that's easy for you to say
now that she's out of the picture.

01:02:41.427 --> 01:02:44.195
I was in love with her, George.
I never felt anything like that in all my life.

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:47.839
Well, it's better late than never.
Now you gotta get back with your own life.

01:02:48.254 --> 01:02:49.847
You're gonna be feeling better soon.

01:02:50.192 --> 01:02:51.767
Time heals all wounds.

01:02:53.239 --> 01:02:54.005
Now,

01:02:54.474 --> 01:02:55.629
open wide cause here comes.

01:02:56.034 --> 01:02:57.894
The train entering the station.

01:02:59.603 --> 01:03:01.710
Open wide. There you go...

01:03:02.554 --> 01:03:06.498
How does that taste like?
I added a little oregano and some chives.

01:03:06.903 --> 01:03:09.432
You're going to make somebody
very happy one day.

01:03:12.493 --> 01:03:13.838
You know,

01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:16.946
after a long time of
silence and betrayal,

01:03:18.478 --> 01:03:20.387
lately Amy and I...

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.272
- have been finding each other again.
- You and Amy?

01:03:24.697 --> 01:03:27.886
- Your wife? Are you feeling OK?
- Yes, I feel OK.

01:03:28.316 --> 01:03:31.607
That's the most incredible thing I've heard
you say in all the years I've known you.

01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:34.768
Life always keeps back more surprises

01:03:35.887 --> 01:03:38.391
than we can ever imagine.

01:03:39.026 --> 01:03:39.809
Yeah.

01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:41.185
Dave...

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.811
I need a favor.

01:03:43.246 --> 01:03:44.264
I gotta go give a poetry reading

01:03:44.673 --> 01:03:46.286
at NYU next month,

01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:47.903
and they want somebody to introduce me.

01:03:48.313 --> 01:03:50.129
George, I understand you
wanting to distract me,

01:03:50.454 --> 01:03:53.819
but this is transparent
occupational therapy.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.799
This is no joke.
I want you to present me in the

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.642
most embarrassing, flattering terms
all those portly pandering profs.

01:04:02.028 --> 01:04:04.280
Present you?
Who's going to present me?

01:04:05.702 --> 01:04:09.392
Forrest Lawn?
George, you're a champ for asking, but...

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:12.518
I can't write anything now.
I'm finished.

01:04:12.844 --> 01:04:14.970
I may never teach another class.
Find somebody else.

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:18.206
I spent half of life
playing Horatio,

01:04:18.515 --> 01:04:21.158
to your third rate Hamlet.

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:25.171
Listening to your endless naval gazing,
your moaning about Kenny, the father-hater,

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:29.017
the women who don't know
when goodbye means goodbye.

01:04:29.495 --> 01:04:32.130
And for this you owe me big-time.

01:04:32.538 --> 01:04:35.458
Now I expect you to do this
in the name of our friendship.

01:04:35.775 --> 01:04:38.211
Now would you fuckin' eat something?

01:04:50.478 --> 01:04:53.179
The Poetry of George O'Hearn

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.228
makes no apology for itself.

01:05:05.856 --> 01:05:09.075
As A.E. Housman wrote

01:05:09.562 --> 01:05:11.404
in his celebrated essay,

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:13.583
"I don't know what poetry is,

01:05:13.996 --> 01:05:16.669
but I recognize
it when I hear it. "

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:20.953
There can be no question that
this evening's guest writes what

01:05:21.342 --> 01:05:24.312
we all instantly recognise as poetry.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.100
Since the publication 25 years ago
of his first work in the New Yorker,

01:05:28.344 --> 01:05:32.102
George O'Hearn's vigorously
masculine voice

01:05:32.546 --> 01:05:35.155
has become a fixture

01:05:35.539 --> 01:05:37.563
of the American poetic landscape.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.893
Poetry which is one and the same time,
the language of the street,

01:05:41.443 --> 01:05:42.932
potent,

01:05:43.235 --> 01:05:45.754
urban and impatient.

01:05:46.133 --> 01:05:49.519
But also the un-selfcentered promptings

01:05:49.955 --> 01:05:52.191
of an unquiet heart.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.385
In 1988, that
unique combination

01:05:55.643 --> 01:05:58.523
of sensibilities
earned George O'Hearn,

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:01.181
The Pulitzer Prize.

01:06:02.488 --> 01:06:05.260
But rather than procrastinate further,

01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:08.171
or damn him with praise

01:06:08.545 --> 01:06:10.193
he will inevitably consider feint,

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:14.342
I turn the proceedings
over to New York's own,

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.852
or, should I say,

01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:19.247
America's own,
George O'Hearn.

01:06:30.155 --> 01:06:31.324
George!

01:06:35.262 --> 01:06:36.785
I'll call an ambulance.

01:06:58.611 --> 01:07:00.288
Hi, David.

01:07:09.138 --> 01:07:10.810
He just woke up a little while ago.

01:07:32.607 --> 01:07:33.935
Hi, David.

01:07:37.675 --> 01:07:39.073
George...

01:07:44.456 --> 01:07:46.484
It's Kepesh.

01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:53.454
I'm here, George. I'm here.

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.397
George...

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.913
I owe you.

01:09:26.158 --> 01:09:29.598
I wonder who he thought I was.

01:09:30.618 --> 01:09:32.627
I think he knew perfectly well.

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:38.307
You're sweet.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.490
I took him as he was.

01:09:44.884 --> 01:09:46.852
He so appreciated that.

01:09:47.356 --> 01:09:49.716
He took me the same.

01:10:00.157 --> 01:10:02.787
- You're going where?
- I just told you. Florida.

01:10:03.524 --> 01:10:04.782
To meet her parents,
just for the week-end.

01:10:05.179 --> 01:10:08.177
- The girl's...
- Her name is Dana.

01:10:08.928 --> 01:10:10.472
You're going to meet her folks?

01:10:11.005 --> 01:10:13.117
Well I think they should know
I'm not just some kind of pervert.

01:10:14.197 --> 01:10:16.826
Kenny, you're nearly 40 years old.
You don't need

01:10:17.206 --> 01:10:20.652
the approval of the parents of a
girl who has three children of her own.

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:22.819
Does she want her parents' approval?

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.428
If you want my approval,
fine, you've got it.

01:10:24.835 --> 01:10:26.911
I just wanted you to understand.
This doesn't mean that

01:10:27.448 --> 01:10:30.411
I don't love Lisa.

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:32.568
Kenny, what are you doing?

01:10:33.053 --> 01:10:34.809
You're going to escape from one prison

01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:38.932
and race headlong into another
maximum security facility.

01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:41.995
Where did you get the idea
that marriage is a prison?

01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:45.039
From serving time.
It wasn't about your mom.

01:10:45.394 --> 01:10:48.358
- I just wasn't cut out for it.
- Is this your version of approval?

01:10:50.861 --> 01:10:52.036
Kenny, listen to me.

01:10:52.523 --> 01:10:53.968
I'm the only father you have.

01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:56.044
I'm the only one you'll ever have.

01:10:57.157 --> 01:10:58.504
What a comfort that is.

01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:01.381
I know I disappointed you.

01:11:01.834 --> 01:11:04.617
But you're not a child,
you've got to get past this rage.

01:11:05.571 --> 01:11:09.278
If you ever want there to be anything
between us you've gotta turn the page.

01:11:11.629 --> 01:11:13.304
Now excuse me,
I have an appointment.

01:11:13.796 --> 01:11:15.089
I'm not finished.

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:17.399
I really have to run.

01:11:17.823 --> 01:11:19.412
- What appointment?
- George's funeral.

01:11:19.702 --> 01:11:20.684
George who?

01:11:20.983 --> 01:11:22.385
- Your friend George?
- Yeah.

01:11:22.636 --> 01:11:24.792
- He died?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

01:11:25.123 --> 01:11:26.869
We'll finish this later, OK?

01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:28.405
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:49.806
Hello?

01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:53.665
I happened to be in town,
I saw the obit in The Times and I...

01:11:54.406 --> 01:11:56.058
In two columns.

01:11:56.768 --> 01:11:58.403
Not bad for a poet, I guess.

01:12:00.495 --> 01:12:02.137
How are you holding up?

01:12:02.636 --> 01:12:05.229
Not so good, but I'll be OK.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.370
How's everything?

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:12.715
Seattle is a great place to
build a business. I'm exhausted.

01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:15.598
But I love it.

01:12:20.492 --> 01:12:22.544
What're you thinking about, Dave?

01:12:22.865 --> 01:12:24.217
Nothing.

01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:27.970
We kept acting like teenagers
all our life, that's all.

01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:34.352
- Who's we? Me and you?
- Yes, you and I.

01:12:35.145 --> 01:12:38.347
We spent our life

01:12:39.454 --> 01:12:42.192
chasing after what?

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.825
The only time you got pregnant you had
an abortion because the time wasn't right.

01:12:46.826 --> 01:12:49.958
That was 15 years ago.

01:12:51.177 --> 01:12:54.070
Did the right time ever come?

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.570
Not the right person.

01:13:20.892 --> 01:13:23.334
Do you remember that tampon
you found in my bathroom?

01:13:24.439 --> 01:13:26.644
That thing belonged to a
young girl I was in love with.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.596
What...

01:13:32.134 --> 01:13:33.985
What kind of chance did we have?

01:13:34.864 --> 01:13:37.002
She and I? None.

01:13:37.684 --> 01:13:39.791
At best we could have dragged it out
a couple of years but in the end

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:43.695
she'd have realized
there was little room

01:13:44.403 --> 01:13:48.162
in her life for a man thirty
odd years older than she.

01:13:49.445 --> 01:13:52.354
Nothing

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:56.103
ever should have happened
between me and that girl.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.715
It was just a mistake.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.706
You're getting old David.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:21.512
The way men look at me
changes every day.

01:14:25.925 --> 01:14:28.204
There are women my age,

01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:30.876
a lot of women who are on

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:33.004
these dating...

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:35.263
websites.

01:14:35.631 --> 01:14:39.070
You're guaranteed a certain
number of dates per year.

01:14:40.581 --> 01:14:43.330
And you pay for the silence...

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:48.363
and...

01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:52.224
the same conversation,
every time.

01:14:58.304 --> 01:15:00.652
I like them like that.

01:15:02.724 --> 01:15:07.071
Is it possible that this is really the
first time we talked to each other?

01:15:09.687 --> 01:15:10.979
Well...

01:15:13.397 --> 01:15:16.936
After 20 years of sleeping together,
it's not bad.

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:18.965
I know a lot of people who

01:15:20.014 --> 01:15:23.653
never got that far in 40 years of marriage.

01:15:45.735 --> 01:15:47.788
What time is your flight?

01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:50.129
9:30.

01:15:50.939 --> 01:15:52.366
I'll take you.

01:15:56.775 --> 01:15:57.931
No.

01:16:00.065 --> 01:16:02.800
Why start now?

01:17:16.211 --> 01:17:18.438
<i>I concentrated on my work.</i>

01:17:18.898 --> 01:17:22.290
<i>I kept asking myself if it was right</i>

01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:27.378
<i>not to go to that fucked up
graduation party of hers.</i>

01:17:32.499 --> 01:17:35.708
<i>It took two years but I finally got
past the death of George.</i>

01:17:36.596 --> 01:17:39.944
<i>I even accepted the loss of Consuela.</i>

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.844
<i>I recovered my equilibrium
and my independence.</i>

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:50.011
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

01:18:04.337 --> 01:18:06.462
The paintings and sculptures
of the day

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:09.833
would literally and figuratively
absorb the energy.

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:13.679
They were almost a self-contained
slice of life, if you will.

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:17.260
That, you put beautifully

01:18:17.619 --> 01:18:19.384
in your opening chapter.

01:18:19.788 --> 01:18:22.244
But also you're making a comment

01:18:22.575 --> 01:18:24.135
on the relationship
between art and ownership.

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:25.625
Well, that's exactly right.

01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:30.167
The people who buy these paintings,
they think that they own the pictures.

01:18:30.592 --> 01:18:33.228
But, in reality, the pictures own them.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.504
The pictures own them.

01:18:36.051 --> 01:18:37.594
they're allowed to live,
they're allowed to house them all.

01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:40.045
They're really custodians for

01:18:40.388 --> 01:18:42.904
a period of time.
They're free to admire it,

01:18:43.187 --> 01:18:44.951
- they're free to worship it if they like...
- In theory...

01:18:45.392 --> 01:18:48.035
- you could purchase the Great Pyramid.
- I take your point.

01:18:48.389 --> 01:18:52.025
But at the end of the day, the pyramid
will still be around and you'll be...

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:54.943
With the Pharaohs.

01:18:55.507 --> 01:18:56.570
My guest today

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.433
is Susan Reese, her novel is
"Blue Hyacinth."

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:00.766
This is "Book Chat"

01:19:01.113 --> 01:19:02.391
I'm David Kapesh.

01:19:03.548 --> 01:19:05.606
Then that's it, that was lovely.
Thank you.

01:19:06.276 --> 01:19:07.623
Not too painful.

01:19:08.126 --> 01:19:09.495
Indeed!

01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:14.354
Thank you.

01:19:15.104 --> 01:19:17.561
- Oh, and happy New Year.
- Thank you and congratulations.

01:19:17.924 --> 01:19:19.778
It's a really... it's a good read.

01:19:20.888 --> 01:19:21.921
Thank you.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.506
One new message.

01:19:44.974 --> 01:19:47.925
Six saved messages.
The first new message.

01:19:51.768 --> 01:19:54.051
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:55.835
How are you?

01:19:56.663 --> 01:19:59.914
Feels strange to call you, but...

01:20:01.366 --> 01:20:04.025
I want to talk to you,
I want to tell you something.

01:20:05.461 --> 01:20:08.105
I want to tell you myself
before you...

01:20:08.694 --> 01:20:11.570
hear it from someone else.
I don't know...

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:15.475
Please, call when you can.
My cellphone number is

01:20:15.826 --> 01:20:17.699
555-0122.

01:20:18.512 --> 01:20:20.218
Please call.
Thanks. Bye.

01:20:22.107 --> 01:20:24.087
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

01:20:24.467 --> 01:20:29.624
I realized that I lived all these years
just to listen to these words.

01:20:31.323 --> 01:20:34.440
I collapsed to the floor,
listening to her message,

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:38.875
again and again, fearing the worst.

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:44.190
She was in love, she was getting married.

01:20:44.808 --> 01:20:47.521
Perhaps she even wanted my blessing.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:02.639
David?

01:21:04.716 --> 01:21:06.668
David...

01:21:07.808 --> 01:21:09.094
Where are you?

01:21:10.654 --> 01:21:15.004
I'm in the car. I was in front of your
building when I left the message.

01:21:16.063 --> 01:21:19.012
What are you doing driving around
New York on New Year's Eve?

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:22.327
I don't know.

01:21:23.873 --> 01:21:25.968
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:21:26.394 --> 01:21:29.050
What's the matter, Consuela?

01:21:31.012 --> 01:21:32.819
I need to see you.

01:21:33.234 --> 01:21:35.196
Then come.

01:21:35.863 --> 01:21:37.893
- Do you have time?
- Always.

01:21:38.186 --> 01:21:41.242
- Okay. I'm coming now.
- Yes.

01:22:12.059 --> 01:22:12.853
Hi.

01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:15.280
Hi.

01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:37.670
So...

01:22:38.901 --> 01:22:40.766
how have you been?

01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:46.731
That one's new.

01:22:47.582 --> 01:22:48.828
Yeah, it's...

01:22:49.155 --> 01:22:51.302
Edward Weston.

01:22:53.609 --> 01:22:55.610
I like your hair.

01:22:57.508 --> 01:23:00.375
I cut a little each day.

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:05.083
So when it disappears
I won't miss it as much.

01:23:21.572 --> 01:23:23.197
I'm sick.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:27.386
I have...

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:30.839
cancer, breast cancer.

01:23:38.953 --> 01:23:41.203
I'm having surgery in two weeks.

01:23:41.495 --> 01:23:43.229
Cancer?

01:23:44.299 --> 01:23:45.599
This is...

01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:49.215
Are you...?

01:23:49.549 --> 01:23:50.811
Afraid? No.

01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:52.622
- No?
- Not exactly.

01:23:53.001 --> 01:23:55.779
That's not what I meant.
I meant...

01:23:57.778 --> 01:23:59.379
What happened?

01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.797
I was in the shower one morning and I...

01:24:07.312 --> 01:24:08.987
I felt this...

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:11.469
thing under my arm.

01:24:11.818 --> 01:24:16.820
So I went to the doctor and he said
it was probably nothing to worry about.

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:19.652
I went to a second doctor
and a third doctor and...

01:24:20.053 --> 01:24:21.627
You know the story.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:24.256
The third doctor said

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:27.210
it was something to worry about.

01:24:27.716 --> 01:24:29.371
And did you panic?

01:24:31.155 --> 01:24:33.044
Yes, I panicked.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.635
I spent a whole month in pure fear.

01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:40.146
Tonight I was going

01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:42.635
to go to this party,

01:24:43.006 --> 01:24:46.155
thinking it would be better than
staying by myself, but...

01:24:48.508 --> 01:24:50.361
David...

01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:52.167
David, no.

01:24:52.502 --> 01:24:53.793
Don't cry.

01:24:54.713 --> 01:24:56.853
Do not cry.

01:24:59.018 --> 01:25:02.965
Why didn't you call me? Why didn't
you call me when this happened?

01:25:06.406 --> 01:25:07.919
I couldn't tell you.

01:25:09.091 --> 01:25:11.721
I couldn't tell you of all people.

01:25:14.185 --> 01:25:15.827
You know what's funny?

01:25:17.676 --> 01:25:20.551
I feel older than you now.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:24.186
You promise me one thing,
that if you should ever

01:25:24.555 --> 01:25:28.907
start to panic, during the night or during
the day or any time, you'll phone me.

01:25:31.175 --> 01:25:32.449
What can I do?

01:25:33.308 --> 01:25:34.422
What can I do?

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.247
It's...

01:25:49.027 --> 01:25:52.361
It's like not being able...

01:25:52.749 --> 01:25:55.397
to get into a...

01:25:55.774 --> 01:25:58.400
a comfortable position, because

01:25:58.815 --> 01:26:02.491
no matter which way you turn,
you're stuck.

01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:06.411
I'm stuck inside myself.

01:26:15.415 --> 01:26:20.288
When I think of all the things
I used to think were so important,

01:26:20.684 --> 01:26:23.020
All the arguments I got
into with my mom,

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:27.069
It's stupid all the time I wasted.

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:29.022
sleeping...

01:26:29.512 --> 01:26:32.586
sleeping my life away.

01:26:41.515 --> 01:26:42.563
David...

01:26:46.485 --> 01:26:48.269
I need to ask you a favor.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.581
Something I can only ask you.

01:26:53.516 --> 01:26:56.203
Anything.
What is it?

01:27:07.832 --> 01:27:09.388
After you,

01:27:10.838 --> 01:27:13.695
I never had a boyfriend.

01:27:16.712 --> 01:27:20.150
who loved my body
as much as you did.

01:27:20.478 --> 01:27:22.281
I find that hard to believe.

01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:25.259
Were there many?

01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:27.904
No.

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:30.791
What about work?
Never fooled around at work?

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.153
- they all did.
- Well of course they did.

01:27:35.326 --> 01:27:38.606
I just wasn't interested.

01:27:44.532 --> 01:27:46.076
I know you loved me.

01:27:47.642 --> 01:27:50.202
And you loved my body.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.514
So...

01:27:54.329 --> 01:27:55.727
before the doctors...

01:27:57.255 --> 01:27:59.063
- ruin it...
- Stop.

01:27:59.679 --> 01:28:03.013
Stop talking that way and
stop thinking that way.

01:28:03.515 --> 01:28:05.929
Consuela no-one's going to ruin you.

01:28:12.837 --> 01:28:14.431
Consuela...

01:28:16.242 --> 01:28:18.614
What is it you want me to do?

01:30:58.573 --> 01:31:00.473
That's the Paris Opera House.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.389
I missed you.

01:31:12.379 --> 01:31:15.077
I missed all the places
we never went.

01:31:35.409 --> 01:31:37.231
Would you like to stay here
tonight?

01:31:43.428 --> 01:31:44.401
No.

01:31:46.621 --> 01:31:47.915
I have to go.

01:31:52.585 --> 01:31:55.882
Would you like me to go with you
when you go to the hospital?

01:31:59.245 --> 01:32:00.589
Consuela...

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.510
You can't do this alone.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:09.307
Why do you say that?

01:32:10.111 --> 01:32:12.361
You do everything alone.

01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:21.813
David...

01:32:22.426 --> 01:32:23.972
Poor man.

01:32:26.102 --> 01:32:28.201
You're more scared than me.

01:32:38.736 --> 01:32:42.349
Will you still want to fuck
me if I lose my breast?

01:32:46.253 --> 01:32:47.739
Will you be up for that?

01:32:48.757 --> 01:32:50.095
Will you?

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:08.058
I'm sorry David.

01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:13.133
Really sorry.

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:21.244
I'm scared, David.

01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:25.415
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:33:26.058 --> 01:33:28.371
Happy New Year!

01:33:45.278 --> 01:33:46.858
Happy New Year.

01:34:53.793 --> 01:34:55.697
- Dad...
- Hi.

01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:57.124
What are you doing here?

01:34:57.533 --> 01:34:59.372
I wondered if you could
spare me a few minutes?

01:35:00.823 --> 01:35:03.447
- er...

01:35:05.139 --> 01:35:06.403
Alright, come here.

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:11.104
Yep, uhuh.

01:35:12.544 --> 01:35:15.144
Thanks, I owe you one.

01:35:15.936 --> 01:35:16.957
Bye.

01:35:19.787 --> 01:35:21.424
She's in very good hands.

01:35:21.804 --> 01:35:23.602
- I know her surgeon.
- And?

01:35:23.974 --> 01:35:25.459
They're going to operate tomorrow.

01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:27.771
She told me in two weeks.

01:35:28.659 --> 01:35:29.565
No.

01:35:29.999 --> 01:35:33.009
- They're going to do it tomorrow.
- What does that mean?

01:35:33.346 --> 01:35:34.878
I'm not her doctor. So...

01:35:35.694 --> 01:35:38.713
I don't know exactly, but it's
probably not a good thing.

01:35:40.856 --> 01:35:42.507
It's a nightmare.

01:35:47.224 --> 01:35:48.817
Have you known her long?

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.291
I hadn't seen her for a couple of years.

01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:55.163
She called me out of the blue
on New Year's Eve with the news.

01:35:57.696 --> 01:36:02.248
I've got all her phone numbers, but I
don't want to make the wrong move here.

01:36:03.181 --> 01:36:04.634
She... when she left...

01:36:05.043 --> 01:36:08.672
she told me she didn't want me to call her.
She was quite definite about that.

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.939
I'm sorry.

01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:17.011
Yep, I know, I'm coming.

01:36:18.932 --> 01:36:20.529
I'm sorry to have barged
in on you like this.

01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:22.126
I know you're strapped for time.

01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:25.756
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Stay strong.

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.301
That's what you tell your patients.

01:36:29.543 --> 01:36:33.595
It must be really tough. Oncology.

01:36:33.957 --> 01:36:36.952
I was your son.
I was prepared for it.

01:36:37.298 --> 01:36:38.999
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Yeah.

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.345
- And I'm sorry that it was under such uh...
- Me too.

01:36:42.752 --> 01:36:45.072
How are things at home?

01:36:45.392 --> 01:36:47.160
We're still together.

01:36:47.487 --> 01:36:48.963
Thanks for asking.

01:36:49.335 --> 01:36:50.783
I'm glad to hear it.

01:36:55.338 --> 01:36:56.773
Dad...

01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:01.857
What are you gonna do?

01:37:15.742 --> 01:37:17.250
Why did she have me
take these photographs?

01:37:17.251 --> 01:37:18.759
Did she want them for herself?

01:37:19.681 --> 01:37:24.216
Or did she intend for me to keep them?

01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:27.657
Well that makes sense.

01:37:28.202 --> 01:37:30.877
Did I ever tell you my theory
about beautiful girls?

01:37:31.247 --> 01:37:32.706
A million times.

01:37:33.135 --> 01:37:34.734
No-one can see them.

01:37:35.887 --> 01:37:36.892
Well?

01:37:37.407 --> 01:37:39.560
Did you ever see her?

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.529
I mean all of her.

01:37:42.943 --> 01:37:45.063
I didn't understand what I saw.

01:37:46.362 --> 01:37:48.249
A lawyer's answer.

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:50.515
You're over-analysing it.

01:37:50.938 --> 01:37:52.927
Who would end a relationship

01:37:53.499 --> 01:37:56.067
because I missed her graduation party.

01:37:56.504 --> 01:37:59.911
She was this weird clutch
of inconsistencies.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.410
You're talking about her in the past tense.

01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:13.938
So do you think they will let me in today?

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.983
She just got out of intensive care.
You can go today.

01:38:18.752 --> 01:38:20.561
Kenny, thank you.

01:38:20.887 --> 01:38:22.257
You're welcome.

01:38:25.194 --> 01:38:27.758
Time passes when you're not looking.

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:38.805
David...

01:39:39.336 --> 01:39:40.524
Yes.

01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:47.220
They took the whole thing.

01:39:53.384 --> 01:39:55.436
I didn't think you would come.

01:39:56.606 --> 01:39:57.875
Why?

01:40:03.544 --> 01:40:05.637
Why did you think that?

01:40:07.471 --> 01:40:10.313
Because I'm no longer beautiful.

01:40:10.783 --> 01:40:12.262
Yes you are.

01:40:15.939 --> 01:40:17.941
You know Hipolita,
the beautiful Amazonian queen?

01:40:18.475 --> 01:40:20.754
She actually cut off her right breast

01:40:21.176 --> 01:40:27.456
so she could shoot her arrows faster
and she was no slouch.

01:40:40.068 --> 01:40:44.708
Will the book be different if
we read it 10 years later?

01:40:46.130 --> 01:40:49.647
You remember my first class.

01:40:54.808 --> 01:40:59.039
- I remember everything.
- Me too.

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.544
Every second.

01:41:12.451 --> 01:41:14.574
I'm gonna miss you.

01:41:37.951 --> 01:41:39.574
I'm here.
