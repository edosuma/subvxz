00:31.740 --> 00:35.702
Male Narrator:
<i>This is the story of</i>
<i>a very nice boy named Greg...</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:44.127
<i>and a very strange boy
named Randy.</i>

00:46.922 --> 00:50.050
‐ Randy: <i>Oh, just orange juice?</i>
‐ You can have one
of my Gatorades.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.678
‐ Thank you.
‐ Don't forget your wallet, bud.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
Narrator:
<i>For the past two weeks,</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:56.765
<i>Randy and Greg
have been rooming together</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:58.433
<i>on an out‐of‐town drywall gig.</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:03.689
<i>At first, everything
had gone swimmingly...</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:07.693
<i>until Randy started
sleepwalking.</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:10.904
<i>He apologized profusely
to his new friend Greg</i>

01:10.988 --> 01:13.949
<i>for waking him up</i>
<i>and terrifying him</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.909
I'm sorry, Greg.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.329
Narrator:
<i>Greg, always the nice boy,</i>
<i>tried to be patient.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.748
You don't have to keep on
apologizing, honestly.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.166
I know it's not your fault.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.543
It's OK.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.044
Narrator:
<i>Wanting to help,</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:28.171
<i>he hoped to figure out
a solution.</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:31.258
Maybe there's a way
that we can, like, fix it.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.010
Well, I don't see
how we can fix it,

01:33.093 --> 01:34.636
because I've been doing it
forever,

01:34.720 --> 01:37.389
<i>and we're only on this job
for two more weeks,</i>

01:37.472 --> 01:39.433
and then you'll be
rid of me for good.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.310
<i>I'm not trying
to get rid of you, Randy.</i>

01:41.393 --> 01:44.229
I'm just saying that
it's only temporary for you.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.398
Narrator:
<i>Which was true.</i>

01:46.481 --> 01:49.067
<i>While Greg was going back
to school in the fall,</i>

01:49.151 --> 01:52.237
<i>Randy would be
a drywall guy forever.</i>

01:52.321 --> 01:56.617
Oh, man, I forgot to go
and get my meat last night.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.538
I can make you another sandwich.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.874
Thank you, Greg.
You're the best.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.334
<i>That's all right.
No problem.</i>

02:07.836 --> 02:11.923
Narrator:
<i>Greg always tried to be</i>
<i>tolerant of Randy's odd habits,</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:15.385
<i>but sleepwalking,
he couldn't ignore.</i>

02:15.469 --> 02:18.096
What if I, like, uh,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.224
I tapped you a little?
You know what I mean?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.908
Just kinda like
when you're in that mode.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.271
Just knock you out
of that deep, deep, deep sleep

02:26.355 --> 02:29.024
<i>and into more
of a lighter sleep?</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:32.444
They say you're not supposed
to wake a sleepwalker.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.446
Just kinda spitballing ideas
here.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.365
<i>We gotta figure something out,
man,</i>

02:36.448 --> 02:38.950
<i>because you keep on
waking me up,</i>

02:39.034 --> 02:40.786
and I need to get some sleep.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.330
I know, and Greg, you're‐‐

02:43.413 --> 02:46.208
you're like the last person
I want to wake up.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.710
‐ It's OK, Randy.
‐ <i>You know what?</i>

02:48.794 --> 02:51.963
I really appreciate...
you rooming with me,

02:52.047 --> 02:53.757
because I know
none of the other guys,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.467
they didn't want
to bunk with me.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.638
‐ That's not true.
‐ Narrator: <i>It was 100% true.</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:01.306
So, thank you.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.100
Thank you for being my friend.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.268
Aw, come on.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.145
I'm serious.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.106
Narrator:
<i>Greg knew in his heart</i>

03:09.189 --> 03:12.109
<i>that he could never
truly be friends with Randy.</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:14.319
<i>But since he was a nice boy...</i>

03:14.403 --> 03:16.822
Greg:
<i>You're welcome.</i>

03:16.905 --> 03:20.700
Narrator:
<i>But even nice boys</i>
<i>have their limits.</i>

03:52.441 --> 03:56.570
Narrator:
<i>Now, there are two things you</i>
<i>should know about sleepwalkers.</i>

03:59.030 --> 04:02.743
<i>One, you should never
wake a sleepwalker.</i>

04:05.036 --> 04:07.956
<i>And two,
when one is sleepwalking,</i>

04:08.039 --> 04:10.375
<i>one is not truly oneself,</i>

04:10.459 --> 04:13.211
<i>and therefore
capable of doing things</i>

04:13.295 --> 04:16.673
<i>that are, well, unexpected.</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:36.443
Oh, shit!

04:43.450 --> 04:45.243
Narrator:
<i>Grew knew all of these things,</i>

04:45.327 --> 04:48.538
<i>and he wanted to be
a nice boy to Randy.</i>

04:48.622 --> 04:51.166
<i>But his patience
was wearing thin.</i>

04:57.047 --> 05:00.675
<i>He was not only exhausted from
countless sleepless nights...</i>

05:00.759 --> 05:02.803
Randy!

05:02.886 --> 05:04.054
Randy, please!

05:04.137 --> 05:06.014
<i>Go back to bed, OK?</i>

05:09.518 --> 05:11.853
Narrator:
<i>He was conflicted.</i>

05:11.937 --> 05:13.647
<i>His mother
had always taught him:</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:15.398
<i>"Be kinder than necessary,</i>

05:15.482 --> 05:17.859
<i>for you never know what
someone is going through."</i>

05:17.943 --> 05:19.236
Jesus!

05:20.612 --> 05:23.240
Narrator:
<i>Sage advice, for sure.</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:27.160
<i>Nevertheless,
hard advice to follow</i>

05:27.244 --> 05:29.871
<i>after a string
of unrestful nights.</i>

05:31.623 --> 05:34.543
<i>So Greg,
near the end of his rope,</i>

05:34.626 --> 05:37.337
<i>decided to try something.</i>

06:02.821 --> 06:04.865
Randy.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.909
Randy, wake up.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.751
Aah!

06:16.835 --> 06:19.004
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no, no!

06:26.761 --> 06:28.597
I just can't believe I did that.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.309
I just can't believe it.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.979
Greg, you know, I'm...

06:36.062 --> 06:38.481
I'm so, so sorry. I'm...

06:38.565 --> 06:40.567
‐ so sorry.
‐ Stop it, Randy.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.194
Just stop apologizing.
I'm the one who tried
to wake you up.

06:43.278 --> 06:47.866
Yeah, but I'm the one
who punched you in the eye.

06:47.949 --> 06:48.950
My best friend!

06:52.120 --> 06:55.123
‐ It's fine.
‐ Well, I just feel awful.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.417
I wish there was
something I could do.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.003
Well, Randy,
if you really want
to do something,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.422
you could make
our sandwiches
for lunch today.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.424
That's not what I mean.
I'm not a little kid.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.635
Well, honestly,
you're acting like one!

07:06.718 --> 07:10.388
Narrator:
<i>Seeing the look</i>
<i>on Randy's face,</i>

07:10.472 --> 07:12.432
<i>Greg walked himself back.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:15.810
It would be helpful
if you made the sandwiches

07:15.894 --> 07:18.188
so we're not late
for work today. OK?

07:20.315 --> 07:21.983
OK.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.786
Shit!

07:32.869 --> 07:34.704
Shit!

07:34.788 --> 07:37.582
I forgot to buy the meat
again last night.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.292
<i>Ohh. You know what?</i>

07:39.376 --> 07:41.086
I'll get the next two rounds.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.462
OK, Greg?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.801
‐ I just wish...
‐ Narrator: <i>And in that moment</i>

07:47.884 --> 07:51.429
<i>as Greg listened to Randy
prattle on senselessly,</i>

07:51.513 --> 07:54.265
<i>he knew that
he couldn't do it anymore.</i>

07:54.349 --> 07:56.184
<i>Not one more night.</i>

07:56.267 --> 07:58.728
Randy:
<i>I just wish</i>
<i>there was something...</i>

07:58.812 --> 08:00.271
Narrator:
<i>He needed to tell Randy</i>

08:00.355 --> 08:01.582
<i>that he could no longer
be his roommate.</i>

08:01.606 --> 08:03.400
Hey, can I borrow
your deodorant?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.778
Narrator:
<i>He was just too nice to do it.</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:08.738
How about a Tootsie Roll?

08:10.115 --> 08:11.449
Tootsie Roll?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.867
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

08:12.951 --> 08:15.537
my dad would tuck me in
every night.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.580
Let's say this is me right here.

08:17.664 --> 08:21.459
This... like...
all tight...

08:21.543 --> 08:23.420
‐ Like a Tootsie Roll.
‐ Like a Tootsie Roll.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.171
Yeah, like a Tootsie Roll.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.551
‐ I like this idea.
‐ <i>Great.</i>

08:31.720 --> 08:34.347
So your dad
tucked you in at night.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.765
Yeah.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.644
That must be why you're so nice.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.105
I'm not that nice.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.066
No. You're the nicest person
I've ever met.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.572
‐ Sandwiches.
‐ Yeah.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.930
Greg:
Couple more nights like that
and I'll be good.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.646
Jesus!

10:06.731 --> 10:08.149
Randy:
<i>What's up?</i>

10:08.233 --> 10:10.401
What happened?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.779
Greg, you're scaring me.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.115
What‐‐ Uh‐‐

10:18.118 --> 10:19.869
Oh, my God.

10:21.037 --> 10:26.209
Ahh.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.836
Aah!

10:29.003 --> 10:32.090
Ohh. Uhh. Ahh.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.260
‐
‐

10:35.343 --> 10:38.471
‐ At least my legs are OK.
‐ Yeah, but everything else‐‐

10:38.555 --> 10:41.015
‐ No, I'm trying to be positive.
‐ Oh, sorry. Yeah.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.809
Did I get out?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.937
Randy, it would seem so, yes.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.565
I guess that Tootsie Roll
wasn't tight enough.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
Yeah.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.735
I don't know what happened.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.415
I guess... I don't know,

11:05.498 --> 11:09.502
I coulda... sat up
and walked out,

11:09.586 --> 11:13.298
and then while I was out there
maybe got attacked

11:13.381 --> 11:14.966
by a dog or something?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.135
Randy, I don't think
a dog did that.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.137
Well, what do you think
happened?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.055
I don't know.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.728
Narrator:
<i>The boys searched the room</i>
<i>for answers.</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:29.898
Is that your bag?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.193
<i>No.</i>

11:35.987 --> 11:37.155
Oh,

11:37.238 --> 11:38.698
Jesus. Ohh.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.752
‐ Tight.
‐ Let me just...

11:59.594 --> 12:00.845
Oh, my God.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.722
<i>Ohh!</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:04.224
Whoa.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.935
Ohh.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.048
- ‐ I think it's a foot.
- ‐

12:37.131 --> 12:38.800
Narrator:
<i>It was a foot.</i>

12:38.883 --> 12:39.884
Ohh, yeah.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.762
It's so delicate.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.266
I think it's...
a female foot.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.185
See the toenail polish?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.145
Ohh! Uhh!

12:53.231 --> 12:54.941
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ <i>No‐‐ I‐‐</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:57.860
Nope. I can't
be a part of this.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.195
Well‐‐

12:59.278 --> 13:02.156
‐ <i>W‐What are you doing?</i>
‐ I'm packing.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.033
‐ Packing?
‐ Yep.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.159
Where are you going?

13:07.161 --> 13:10.415
I don't think this is the time
to <i>go</i> anywhere.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.042
‐ Greg, you can't leave!
‐ Randy.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.962
You gotta believe me!
I didn't do it!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.463
I never said that you did.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.048
Yeah, but you're
acting like I did.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.509
‐ You're running away scared!
‐ I just‐‐

13:21.592 --> 13:23.928
‐ You're scared of me.
‐ I can't deal with this.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.388
We <i>have</i> to deal with it!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.598
‐ "We"?!
‐ The foot is here, now!

13:27.682 --> 13:29.642
‐ Hold on.
‐ Yeah, "we"!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.477
I need you!

13:31.561 --> 13:33.813
I‐ I can't deal with this alone!

13:33.896 --> 13:37.108
This is <i>your</i> mess.
I'm just your
fucking roommate, OK?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.777
I thought you were
my best friend.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.530
Randy, I am not
your friggin'
best friend!

13:42.613 --> 13:45.783
I'm the only person
who's willing to bunk
with you!

13:45.867 --> 13:47.910
And now you're holding
a fucking foot,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.203
and you won't let me leave!

13:50.580 --> 13:52.040
Because I need your help.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.834
I'm so sick and tired
of helping you.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.836
<i>And now you want me
to help you what,</i>

13:56.919 --> 13:59.464
find out whose foot
you sawed off yesterday?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.923
Fuck that.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.842
Fuck. That.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.058
I'm gonna put the foot
back in the bag.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.399
<i>Greg...</i>

14:18.483 --> 14:20.234
<i>look, I need you.</i>

14:23.321 --> 14:25.448
There's a foot in a bag

14:25.531 --> 14:27.533
and I don't know what to do.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.705
Please don't leave.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.003
Narrator:
<i>And then Greg</i>
<i>heard that voice again‐‐</i>

14:39.087 --> 14:42.632
<i>the one reminding him
that he's a nice boy.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:45.676
<i>And nice boys don't walk away
from people in need.</i>

14:45.760 --> 14:47.400
Woman on TV:
<i>A black Honda Civic</i>
<i>drove into</i>

14:47.470 --> 14:48.888
<i>the Fourth and Cross Dairy Queen</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:50.890
<i>last night
sometime around 3:00 a. m.,</i>

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
<i>but otherwise,
a pretty quiet night.</i>

14:53.101 --> 14:54.477
<i>Karen, over to you.</i>

14:54.560 --> 14:56.200
Karen on TV:
<i>Traffic is already loading up</i>

14:56.229 --> 14:57.869
<i>on the Beltway,
but that's not a surprise,</i>

14:57.897 --> 14:59.690

No.

I'm a good person.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.672
You can be honest.

15:29.137 --> 15:33.057
Ah, well, I think...

15:33.141 --> 15:36.394
you are not a smart person.

15:36.477 --> 15:40.148
I think you are

15:40.231 --> 15:42.650
unprepared and clueless

18:51.088 --> 18:52.590
You can keep my number,

18:52.673 --> 18:54.425
and then if you ever
need anything,

18:54.508 --> 18:58.512
anything at all,
you just call me.

OK.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.692
you just let me know
and I'll come running

19:11.776 --> 19:14.028
and I'll just fucking kill 'em!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.948
Sorry.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.368
I didn't...
mean it like that.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.827
You know what I mean.
