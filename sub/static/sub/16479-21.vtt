WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.937
The dream is dead. Say good-bye
to the Schmidt Charitable Trust.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.138
I don't know what that is.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.339
But is that why you
were throwing lightbulbs

00:07.341 --> 00:08.440
against our garage?

00:08.442 --> 00:10.542
That was unrelated.
Oh.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.211
It's the foundation
that I was going to establish

00:12.213 --> 00:14.480
to take the Schmidt brand to
the next level, but now I can't.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.382
The name is taken.
What?

00:16.384 --> 00:18.117
Get a load of that.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.819
The Schmidt Charitable Trust
was established in 1948

00:20.821 --> 00:21.887
by Cranston Schmidt

00:21.889 --> 00:24.556
to promote nudity
in restaurants.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.792
Cranston Schmidt
and his naked waitresses.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.993
What am I supposed to do now?

00:27.995 --> 00:30.029
How can I show my peers
that I make so much money

00:30.031 --> 00:31.864
that I could just throw it away
on strangers?

00:31.866 --> 00:34.133
There is one way that you could
maybe solve your problem.

00:34.135 --> 00:34.900
What?

00:34.902 --> 00:37.036
You could use your first name.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.408
What did you say?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.977
You are not a frat boy
drinking at a keg anymore, okay?

00:44.979 --> 00:48.080
You are an executive now.
You're a baller.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.581
I am a baller.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.916
Also, I was never
allowed in frats.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.018
Too much hazing that required
a visible penis.

00:53.020 --> 00:53.986
Oh, baby.

00:53.988 --> 00:54.987
JESS:
Just do it.
(shouts)

00:54.989 --> 00:55.988
Like, who cares?

00:55.990 --> 00:57.056
How long have you been here?

00:57.058 --> 00:58.190
Long enough, Schmidt.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.892
Yeah, we keep
the camera running all day.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.161
I'm trying to keep Jess company
while she's in Portland.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.263
Yeah, yesterday I watched Cece
read for a while.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.432
Oh, wow, that sounds like
fun, Jess, good for you.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.666
Cece...

01:07.668 --> 01:09.101
Jess needs us right now.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.602
She's still mopey over Nick.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.503
I'm not mopey.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.504
I'm rad.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.906
I'm gleaming the cube.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.075
She's lying.
She's a wreck.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.709
JESS:
Ugh, Dad!

01:17.711 --> 01:19.445
Ugh, I'm on the phone!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.713
You're so embarrassing.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.349
All he does is just
recycle cans all day.

01:24.351 --> 01:28.253
I wish his child bride
would come back from Denver

01:28.255 --> 01:30.355
so he'd have someone else
to bother.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.057
Let's just get you
out of this house.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.093
Yeah, right.
Well, what are you going to do?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.094
You're gonna sit
on this couch all day long?

01:35.096 --> 01:36.095
You'll get sofa butt.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.563
Come on, let's go
get some ice cream.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.631
Ugh, I hate ice cream. Dad!

01:39.633 --> 01:41.433
Nobody hates ice cream.
It's stupid.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.469
Yeah, it's stupid, Dad.
I'm un-- I feel
uncomfortable watching this.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.536
It's so stupid.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.271
Hey, Cece.
Dad.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.073
Hi, Schmidt. How are you?

01:48.075 --> 01:49.708
Dad! Don't talk to my friends!

01:49.710 --> 01:51.477
♪ ♪

01:53.280 --> 01:54.279
(Nick clearing throat)

01:54.281 --> 01:55.948
Achoo!

01:55.950 --> 01:58.050
(shushes)

01:58.052 --> 01:59.318
(clears throat)

01:59.320 --> 02:01.420
Oh, you're up.
You woke me up.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.788
Hey, do you mind
if I run something by you

02:02.790 --> 02:04.156
that's very personal,
very hot button?

02:04.158 --> 02:05.924
I do, I need to rest.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.759
I'm working nights this week.
Oh, as a police officer?

02:07.761 --> 02:10.295
No, Nick, as a prostitute.
Yes, as a cop.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.798
Now will you please leave
my room? I'm very tired

02:12.800 --> 02:14.833
and I need to get some rest.
I understand, but here it comes,
I have to tell you.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.468
I don't want to hear it.
Aly, I'm gonna tell you.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.102
I swear to God.
I need to break up with Reagan
but I don't know how to.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
Damn it, Nick.
Oh, now you're involved.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.773
So now that you're involved,
we need to talk it out

02:21.775 --> 02:23.775
'cause we're basically
partners in this.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.977
We're not partners.
Things with Reagan and I

02:24.979 --> 02:26.411
haven't been working out,

02:26.413 --> 02:28.413
and last night
it really came to a head.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.816
It's just crazy. You know,
I was just driving down the...

02:30.818 --> 02:32.584
Mm-hmm. Sounds crazy.
Reagan.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.286
Yes?

02:34.288 --> 02:36.522
I worked all day.
We haven't seen each other.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.756
Don't you want to catch up?

02:37.758 --> 02:40.325
(sighs) Yes.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.361
(clears throat)
Fine, what?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.996
What happened to you today?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.365
I saw a seagull in the backseat
of a moving car.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.503
Can we have sex now?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.972
Ugh, you don't get it.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.607
Let's get it over with.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.975
What does this
have to do with me?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.343
I was hoping you'd tell me
how to break up with her.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.180
Just pretend you're an adult
and get it over with.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.182
Yeah.
Train's already left
the station, Nick.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.050
The longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.451
The train already left
the station, huh?

03:06.453 --> 03:07.653
Yep.
Thank you.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.154
You're welcome.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.622
Hey, say, wake up.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.991
Question. Excuse me.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.226
Yes, Nick?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.195
Do you think that looks like
a monster's butthole?

03:18.165 --> 03:19.631
I kind of do, yeah.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.099
Yeah, me, too.
It's really gross.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.673
What's going on, Schmidt?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.074
Man, are you having
trouble ordering

03:29.076 --> 03:30.409
from that
Jamaican restaurant again?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.211
I don't know how many
times I got to tell you.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.079
Don't walk in there
using their accent

03:34.081 --> 03:35.814
'cause it's kind of racist.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.083
The time has finally come

03:38.085 --> 03:39.918
for me to launch my own brand.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.886
Are you really
not gonna turn around?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.020
Not yet.

03:42.022 --> 03:45.057
This brand will
be my legacy.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.858
And this is where you come in.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.194
Ooh! You had that timed right!

03:49.196 --> 03:51.029
I'm going to start using
my first name again.

03:51.031 --> 03:55.834
Schmidt, I think that
is a very bad idea.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.035
I have no choice!

03:57.037 --> 03:58.837
When I was born,
my parents gave me a name.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.572
Don't do this, Schmidt.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.741
Ain't nothing
but pain down that road.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.878
It is the name that I was called
for most of my life, and...

04:06.880 --> 04:08.447
I want my name back.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.452
Isn't this fun?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.387
Remember, we used
to come here all the time,

04:15.389 --> 04:17.256
every time you won
a tennis match.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.257
That was your other daughter.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.958
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.927
You-You were always
in a production of<i> Annie,</i>

04:21.929 --> 04:23.929
but never Annie, though.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.564
Priscilla, come here.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.399
Come here, I want you to
meet my daughter, Jessica.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.034
Remember?
I told you about her.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.736
She's the one
that doesn't play tennis.

04:30.738 --> 04:34.539
Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.641
(laughs)

04:35.643 --> 04:37.876
Well, two rum raisin sundaes

04:37.878 --> 04:39.544
and whatever
my daughter wants.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.079
(Priscilla and Bob laugh)

04:41.081 --> 04:42.247
You.

04:42.249 --> 04:45.083
(laughs)

04:45.085 --> 04:48.387
(quietly): Her husband fell
down a spiral staircase.

04:48.389 --> 04:52.057
What?
He kept falling,
falling, continually falling.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.059
It was awful.
He didn't die.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.394
But when he found out

04:55.396 --> 04:58.463
that he had become
a viral sensation...

04:58.465 --> 04:59.498
he killed himself.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.067
Ugh. I know how he feels.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.336
Jess, are you still
upset about Nick?

05:04.338 --> 05:06.004
You got to, you got
to move past that.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.607
It's hard. You don't know
what it's like to be alone.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.175
I do know what it's like.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.276
Ashley and I broke up.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.011
What?! When?
Yeah.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.513
Yeah, about six months ago.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.315
Uh, but I-I didn't
want to worry you.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.484
Dad. It's my job to worry.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.988
Was it the 40-year
age difference?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.757
Were you tired of waiters
just asking again and again

05:25.759 --> 05:27.659
if it was a
daddy-daughter dinner?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.628
Sorry, no, that's not...

05:29.630 --> 05:31.263
REAGAN:
<i> You said that the pill</i>

05:31.265 --> 05:32.831
sold itself, so let me ask you,

05:32.833 --> 05:34.132
is the pill a cure

05:34.134 --> 05:35.334
for a kick in the balls?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.002
Because you're gonna need it.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.337
Oh, no.
Hey, Nicky, what's up?

05:40.341 --> 05:41.840
Uh, I can wait.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.608
No, it's okay, go ahead,
I'm sorry.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.084
I want to tell you...
(mouths)

05:54.288 --> 05:56.054
What?
I said what
I needed to say.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.022
Nothing came out of your mouth.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.024
I feel like we're on a train.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.127
Where are we going?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.228
We're going to San Diego.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.230
What?
I panicked and it just came out.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.399
Let me tell you something,
sister, your plan didn't work.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.467
This wasn't my plan.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.068
Well, you brought up trains,
didn't you?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.570
And you got in my head.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.071
San Diego part?
Well, that's on me.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.706
I'm not engaging
with you over this.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.708
So, what do we do now?
I don't know, Nick.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.710
I've never experienced a person
trying to break up with someone,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.079
and instead inviting them
on a beach vacation.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.415
I didn't do this on purpose.
I feel like you led me here.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.484
This is not on me.
So what do you want me to do?

06:25.486 --> 06:27.352
You want me to go break up
with her down in San Diego?

06:27.354 --> 06:29.087
I don't, I don't care
at this point.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.223
Why? Because it's private?
Live your life, man.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.324
Because the weather
is really nice?

06:32.326 --> 06:34.092
And what happens
if it doesn't work out?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.161
I'm just gonna go move down
to Mexico and start a new life?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.362
No one's suggesting any of this.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.830
You're a genius.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.932
(laughs)
Thank you, Aly.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.000
I knew I came
to the right person.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.502
I'll do it.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.237
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard,

06:45.239 --> 06:47.072
and I feel like
I should call San Diego

06:47.074 --> 06:48.039
to warn them about you.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.075
But you seem convinced,

06:50.077 --> 06:52.411
so if it gets you
out of here faster, God bless.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.211
Do you believe in God, Aly?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.046
I believe in hell and I'm in it.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.348
Oh, this is hell?
Yes!

06:56.350 --> 06:58.116
Then why don't you stay
out of my business?!

06:58.118 --> 06:59.251
That's all I'm trying to do,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.619
but you keep bringing me
your business!

07:00.621 --> 07:01.920
Ah, to hell with you!

07:01.922 --> 07:03.021
We're going to San Diego!

07:03.023 --> 07:04.356
Fine!
Fine!

07:04.358 --> 07:06.291
Go!
I'm going!

07:06.293 --> 07:08.360
Don't say anything.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.367
I should have known
right from the start.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.635
On our honeymoon,
we're in the ocean,

07:16.637 --> 07:19.237
a-a-and Ashley sees a shark
coming towards us.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.705
You know what she does?

07:20.707 --> 07:22.073
She pushes me in front of it
and says,

07:22.075 --> 07:23.308
"Eat him! Eat him!"

07:23.310 --> 07:25.043
What?
That-that was a clue.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.745
That was a clue.
I just hate
thinking of you

07:26.747 --> 07:27.979
all alone in that house.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.548
I'm fine.
I got my cans.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.416
Gets me out of bed
in the morning.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.285
What if you met someone new?
Oh, no.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.286
JESS:
Really.
BOB: Aw, no.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.121
Dad, what about...

07:36.123 --> 07:37.956
What about Priscilla?
What?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.925
What? Come on.
No. No.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.426
I'm an old man.
She doesn't want an old man.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.129
Look. I've got a Band-Aid
on my hand.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.964
Not on the finger, the hand.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.632
That is an old-man thing.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.434
Okay. Hey, Priscilla.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.406
Hi. I was wondering
if you would like to

07:54.408 --> 07:57.309
get a decaf coffee and talk
about local news with my dad.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.010
Really, Bob?
You want to take me out?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.413
Ha, ha, ha, you...

08:01.415 --> 08:03.148
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.084
Yeah, I have a new jean jacket
I've been wanting to break out.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.686
It's stone-washed.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.488
BOB: Okay.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.356
Okay.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.792
Well, that was just about

08:13.794 --> 08:14.960
the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

08:14.962 --> 08:15.994
Even though this morning

08:15.996 --> 08:17.295
I thought you were married.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.797
What about you?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.098
I'm supposed to be
cheering<i> you</i> up.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.099
You did cheer me up.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.268
You got me off of the couch.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.503
It's good to be out
of the house.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.637
You kids have fun.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.973
Okay, thanks.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.808
So this is a surprise.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.109
Where do you think
we should go?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.477
Where do<i> you</i> think
we should go?

08:32.479 --> 08:33.645
Look, Schmidt, we both
know there's only room

08:33.647 --> 08:34.980
for one Winston.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.115
And we found that out
the hard way, didn't we?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.117
Homecoming weekend, 2002.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.152
I'm Winston! I'm Winston!
I'm Winston! I'm Winston!

08:41.154 --> 08:42.888
We can't live like this!

08:42.890 --> 08:44.389
Only one Winston.
Body slam!

08:44.391 --> 08:46.658
Get off!
Get off!

08:46.660 --> 08:47.893
You'll kill him!

08:47.895 --> 08:50.795
We have tried every
single variation.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.997
Fat Winston, Thin Winston.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.031
Too derogatory.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.399
Black Winston,
Jew Winston.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.368
Obviously problematic.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.669
Hot Winston,
Ugly Winston.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.005
No...
That nearly
tore us apart.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.341
Which is why we came up
with the one-Winston rule.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.243
Yeah, but those were
angry times.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.046
Let's make it double Ws.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.383
(exhales)

09:17.157 --> 09:19.925
Welcome back, Winston.

09:19.927 --> 09:24.095
It's good to be back,
Winston.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.597
REAGAN:
San Diego.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.032
The wonderful San Diego.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.100
Where are we staying?
Not sure.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.870
Maybe we're gonna get the nicest
hotel in the city, huh?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.705
Maybe you're gonna stay there,

09:33.707 --> 09:36.374
and maybe I'm gonna
head back to Los Angeles today.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.777
I'm gonna stay in San Diego,
and you're gonna go back?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.579
Who knows what's gonna
happen down there?

09:40.581 --> 09:43.048
That's the fun
of a trip like this.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.449
Nick, you would tell me

09:44.451 --> 09:45.717
if you were gonna
murder me, right?

09:45.719 --> 09:46.885
No, 'cause then you could

09:46.887 --> 09:49.888
prepare for it, you silly.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.922
What is wrong with you?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.591
What is wrong with<i> me? </i>
Yeah.

09:52.593 --> 09:53.959
The guy taking you
to San Diego--

09:53.961 --> 09:56.094
the Paris of
Southern California?

09:56.096 --> 09:56.962
Okay.
You're losing it.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.763
I'm acting totally normal.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.365
You need a drink
just to chill out.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.101
What is wrong with you?
Getting those drinks.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.003
MAN (over P.A.):
This stop, Anaheim.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.409
(mouths)

10:11.411 --> 10:12.644
(train horn blows)

10:12.646 --> 10:14.579
(mouthing)

10:14.581 --> 10:16.281
You should have seen him.
The only time

10:16.283 --> 10:18.116
my dad gets that nervous
is when he doesn't know

10:18.118 --> 10:19.718
where to print out
his boarding pass.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.553
It's so weird to think
of him dating again.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.588
BOB (moaning): Oh! Oh...
Wait.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.923
What is that?
It sounds like

10:24.925 --> 10:26.725
someone's moving
a washing machine.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.994
Oh, my God, my dad's boning!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.795
My dad's boning!
My dad's boning!
Oh, my God, listen to me.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.964
Get out of the house.
Get out of the house!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.966
(cans clattering loudly)
BOB: Jess?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.935
Is that you?
No. Yes.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.170
I mean, no, it's the cans.
I just, um...

10:39.172 --> 10:41.172
Finish what you're doing.
No, don't finish.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.009
I mean, everyone deserves
to finish-- oh, God!

10:44.011 --> 10:46.011
(cans clattering)
Oh, cans!

10:50.283 --> 10:52.083
Can we talk about this?
Yeah, just one sec.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.318
I'm just replacing
the sound of your skin

10:53.320 --> 10:54.653
slapping against
someone else's

10:54.655 --> 10:56.254
with the sound
of crushing metal.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.656
I didn't know
you were gonna be home.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.924
I thought you were
gonna be out having a day.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.960
And you were supposed
to be having coffee.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.095
You just put out
on the first date?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.864
We had a connection.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.098
I-I think I'm in love with her.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.833
Oh, my God, I need more cans.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.335
I got to have more cans.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.936
Hey, you know,
I'm a passionate guy.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.040
All right.
What are you doing, Dad?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.142
Well, I mean, you were nice
enough to help me to move on.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.045
Now I'm gonna see if I can
find somebody for you.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.681
Got it.
My best friend Ray.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.849
His son John.
Well, he's a little heavyset,

11:24.851 --> 11:26.451
but, you know,
he makes a good living.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.786
Dad, put the Rolodex down.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.622
Look, we're not in
the same boat, okay?

11:30.624 --> 11:33.992
I can't move on.
I love him.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.128
Nick?
What do you see in him?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.197
I mean, he looks like
the only white waiter

11:39.199 --> 11:40.632
at a Chinese restaurant.

11:43.236 --> 11:47.072
There isn't a logical
explanation,

11:47.074 --> 11:50.075
but it is what it is.

11:50.077 --> 11:53.144
I love him.
I wish I didn't, but I do.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.547
Come here.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.982
Dad, if you'll excuse me, I have
to go to the recycling plant.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.385
It closes in an hour.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.322
From now on, I will
be Winston Schmidt,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.257
and he will be
Winston Bishop.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.359
We are both Winstons.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.928
Wait, your first
name is Winston?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.730
Did I know that?
No.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.832
I have not slept
in 36 hours.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.500
Well, you should
get some sleep.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.702
Isn't that
right, Winston?
Oh, absolutely, Winston.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.070
Sleep is very important.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.106
It is the most
important, Winston.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.407
Okay, this is
already too much.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.075
In my head it wasn't
this annoying.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.411
Winston, why don't you
just go by "The Bish"?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.512
I'm sorry, are you
talking to me?

12:27.514 --> 12:28.747
You know I'm
talking to you.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.914
I knew she was
talking to you.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.915
You knew the whole time?
Yeah.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.117
Ooh, I couldn't tell.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.118
Wait a minute,
why does Winston...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.919
Yes?
Oh, my God.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.555
Why does<i> my</i> Winston
have to change his name?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.757
Schmidt, don't you have
a middle name?

12:38.759 --> 12:39.891
I do have a middle name.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.693
It's Saint-Marie.
Hmm.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.061
And obviously I
can't go by that.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.262
That's hilarious.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.864
Oh, hello, hello!

12:45.866 --> 12:47.632
Wait, what are you
doing here?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.701
Oh, well, I couldn't
break up with Reagan,

12:49.703 --> 12:52.303
so I jumped off the train.
Hmm?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.038
Problem, problem solved.
What's up with you guys?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.474
Why didn't I
know about this?
I don't know, Schmidt,

12:56.476 --> 12:58.109
'cause you weren't
around, I guess.
Well, actually,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.110
I'm Winston now.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.311
I'm using my first name again.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.747
Uh... actually
there can't be two Winstons.

13:02.749 --> 13:03.948
It nearly destroyed us.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.583
Nick, hold up, can we
go back to that moment

13:05.585 --> 13:06.918
where you jumped
off a train?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.419
Sure. You find that part
interesting?

13:08.421 --> 13:09.821
Okay, I don't care
about the answer,

13:09.823 --> 13:10.955
but I feel like
I got to ask,

13:10.957 --> 13:12.924
as someone who works
in law enforcement--

13:12.926 --> 13:15.593
where is Reagan?

13:15.595 --> 13:16.928
Well, she's probably getting off
at the next stop, and then

13:16.930 --> 13:17.996
she'll be on her way here

13:17.998 --> 13:19.497
for some sort of a reckoning,

13:19.499 --> 13:20.999
I would imagine.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.168
"Problem solved" was probably

13:23.170 --> 13:25.136
a bit of a, an overstatement.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.571
The good news is that I don't
have to break up with her

13:26.573 --> 13:28.106
'cause now she's gonna
break up with me.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.941
Oh, Nick.
What is wrong
with you?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.743
It's gonna be okay, Nick.
Give Winston a hug.

13:31.745 --> 13:32.744
Come on. Here we go.
Here you go, Winston.

13:32.746 --> 13:33.945
I meant "me Winston."

13:33.947 --> 13:35.580
I'm "me Winston," too!
Hey, guys!

13:35.582 --> 13:36.614
Reagan's on her way.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.816
I've got too much
to deal with

13:37.818 --> 13:39.117
to deal with this
two Winstons thing.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.685
What, I can't have a first
name because you left

13:40.687 --> 13:41.953
some woman on a train?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.354
Don't put that
on me, man!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.490
I'm not calling you
Winston, Schmidt.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.926
'Cause if I do, then what am I
gonna call the real Winston?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.327
Call him I don't care!
I don't care!
Hey, Winston,

13:49.329 --> 13:50.962
you want to get a drink?
Sure.
I'm down.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.530
I was talking to that Winston.
Oh.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.765
After the drink, you want
to get some dinner, Winston?

13:53.767 --> 13:54.783
Yes.
Ooh, you know
your boy hungry.

13:54.784 --> 13:55.800
That time I was talking
to this Winston.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.368
So, I can come if you want.
I'm down to go.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.604
No, I'm trying
to figure it out, okay?
Wait, time out.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.939
Are we eating,
or are we not eating?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.807
They're both
real Winstons,

14:02.809 --> 14:05.176
but the old Winston
is now The Bish.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.278
I'm not calling my fiancé
"the" anything.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.047
Nah, man, this is taking me
to a bad place.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.149
I'm having...
I'm having cold feet.
What?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.018
Yeah, the two Winstons thing is
not gonna work-- Nick is right.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.720
You've had Winston for 15 years.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.655
It's my turn. I'm Winston.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.158
You will never be Winston.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.126
Oh, you want to dance?

14:22.128 --> 14:22.994
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.662
Okay.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.864
Come on.
Come on.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.998
Come on.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.032
Okay, what is happening?
WINSTON: Come on.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.868
SCHMIDT: Come on.
I used to live by myself.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.002
Come on.
Come on.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.070
I had covered parking,
I was happy.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.304
I'm Winston.
Guys, no.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.839
It's not about you, man.
I am Winston.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.174
Shut up!

14:36.176 --> 14:38.042
I'll kill you! I'll murder you!

14:38.044 --> 14:39.177
NICK: I can't do
this right now.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.211
I got too much on my plate.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.212
I'm Winston.
I'm Winston.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.981
Nah, I'm Winston.
Ah, I'm Winston.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.016
Yet, somehow,
all the Michaels in the world

14:45.018 --> 14:46.484
manage to deal with this
every day.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.418
Mm-hmm.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.520
Go to sleep,
go to sleep.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.889
(phone rings)

14:50.891 --> 14:52.257
Hello?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.058
Mr. Day. It's Nick Miller.
Is Jess there?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.894
She's out.
Can I take what I assume

14:55.896 --> 14:57.428
will be an idiotic message?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.030
Ah, it's actually,
it's kind of private.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.266
Okay, fine. Talk to you later.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.101
Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell
you. I'm breaking up with Reagan

15:03.103 --> 15:05.103
and it didn't quite go
as planned.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.938
I'm, I'm in a really bad
situation

15:06.940 --> 15:09.507
and Jess always says
the right thing

15:09.509 --> 15:11.643
and I, I really need her.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.513
Let me, let me ask you
a question.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.448
You're in the ocean with Jess,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.350
and a shark starts
coming towards you.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.885
What do you do?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.921
Which ocean?
I-I don't know, Pacific.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.923
What type of shark?
What the hell difference
does it make?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.124
Well if it's a hammerhead,
you just tickle it

15:26.126 --> 15:27.258
between the sideways eyes

15:27.260 --> 15:28.960
and you have
a companion for life.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.762
Then you got tiger sharks,
you got whale sharks,

15:30.764 --> 15:32.931
you got trumpet sharks,
which I believe are a thing--

15:32.933 --> 15:34.065
if not, it definitely should be.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.767
It's just a regular shark.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.135
You know what? Good-bye.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.970
Okay, vague premise aside,

15:38.972 --> 15:41.072
I don't know what I would do,
but if Jess was with me,

15:41.074 --> 15:43.942
I'm sure...
I'm sure we'd be okay.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.077
She's got that giant heart

15:46.079 --> 15:49.480
that's, that's part compass
and, and part flashlight

15:49.482 --> 15:53.985
and... she's just the greatest
person I have ever met.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.921
Bob? Does that answer
your question or what?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.257
It does.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.326
Weirdly enough, it does.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.161
But I also don't accept
your weird-ass premise, man,

16:03.163 --> 16:04.896
'cause it's absolutely
preposterous...

16:04.898 --> 16:06.464
REAGAN: Nick.
NICK: Oh, my God. She's here.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.435
Nick.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.137
Nicholas,
I can see you.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.206
Hey. How was San Diego?

16:19.512 --> 16:24.582
Hey, so Reagan's in your
room, packing up her stuff.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.517
What'd you say to her?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.786
Nothing.
I-I didn't say anything.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.955
I just, uh, crawled out
from under the bed

16:30.957 --> 16:31.956
where I was hiding.

16:31.958 --> 16:32.957
She said,
"It's over,"

16:32.959 --> 16:34.993
which makes sense,

16:34.995 --> 16:37.996
and then I came in here,
and this is now my fifth beer

16:37.998 --> 16:39.364
in as many minutes.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.265
I'm impressed.
No, you shouldn't be.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.267
I once drank nine beers
in five minutes.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.870
I hear that cry for help,
but I meant the breakup.

16:45.872 --> 16:49.007
You ended a relationship
without any confrontation.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.475
You got what you wanted.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.343
Then why do I feel so terrible?

16:52.345 --> 16:55.480
Maybe you feel bad because
your relationship with Reagan

16:55.482 --> 16:57.482
actually meant something to you,

16:57.484 --> 16:59.150
and you ended it like it didn't.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.853
Right.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.122
I'm sorry I put you
in the middle of this, Aly.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.157
But I'm also glad you were here
'cause I feel like we bonded.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.458
It was one of the most
frustrating days

17:07.460 --> 17:08.526
of my entire life.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.028
I'm exhausted.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.230
I feel like a single mom
in a mop commercial.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.032
Welcome to the loft.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.037
Hey.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.040
Taking a little trip?

17:22.042 --> 17:24.075
I hear San Diego's lovely.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.645
I regret that.

17:27.647 --> 17:31.149
I'm sorry I left you
on the train, Reagan.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.084
You deserve better than that.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.754
The truth is, is I wanted
to break up with you,

17:36.756 --> 17:38.222
and I didn't know how to.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.359
Okay.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.428
I mean, I'm not mad anymore,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.230
more just... scared
of what it must be like

17:46.232 --> 17:48.099
to have to live
inside of your head.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.901
Look, I'm sorry.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.335
It's okay.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.737
I've been thinking about

17:52.739 --> 17:54.105
breaking up
with you for a while.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.941
So, we just wanted
really different things.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.412
I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.915
I'm not good
at good-byes either.

18:08.421 --> 18:12.423
I think I'm gonna go stand
in the closet for a little bit.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.092
Okay.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.160
Okay.
Okay.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.805
Bye, Nick.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.007
Yeah, bye, Reagan.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.618
What do you want?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.820
To be your friend.

18:42.822 --> 18:46.290
If you need the name Winston

18:46.292 --> 18:47.925
to get you to where
you're going,

18:47.927 --> 18:50.795
then... I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.664
You're a good friend.

18:55.301 --> 18:59.103
Uh, uh, what will I call you?

18:59.105 --> 19:00.771
Well, I was gonna give
Saint-Marie a whirl,

19:00.773 --> 19:02.673
but then I was like, nah,

19:02.675 --> 19:04.108
that's a girl's name.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.110
And I thought about Two-Shoes.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.612
Two-Shoes.
Two-Shoes, yeah.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.647
But then, in certain shoes
that I have,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.949
I have three of them,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.951
so... so I'm just gonna stick
with The Bish.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.020
Come here.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.855
Thank you, The Bish.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.557
Thanks, Winston.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.429
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you come on inside...

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
Very weird.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.369
Strange man.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.004
I love Wednesday nights.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.006
And this one's
even more special,

19:35.008 --> 19:36.807
'cause I got my name back.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.277
I love you, Cece.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.112
I love you so much, Winston.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.616
Oh, God.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.118
I don't like it! I don't
like it! I don't like it!

19:47.120 --> 19:48.319
Damn it!
Ugh...

19:48.321 --> 19:50.388
Take your name back.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.156
SCHMIDT:
I don't want it.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.124
What's wrong
with the name Winston?

19:53.126 --> 19:54.492
It's horrible,
just take it back.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.561
Worst name
in the entire history of names.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.396
What'd you say about my name?

19:58.398 --> 20:00.631
Stop. N... You know what,
I don't care.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.733
Come on.
(shouts)

20:05.305 --> 20:07.038
Cha-ching.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.306
Hey, hey, Jess, Jess!

20:08.308 --> 20:10.141
I've been trying to call you.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.310
I-I talked to Nick.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.679
What?
He called looking
for you, and...

20:14.681 --> 20:18.249
you know, oddly,
I-I see what you see in him.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.051
It doesn't matter.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.686
He has a girlfriend.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.889
He and Reagan broke up.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.225
And you know
something?

20:27.227 --> 20:29.427
I don't even think
he realizes it,

20:29.429 --> 20:33.231
but he's still in love with you.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.172
(grunting, shouting)
I got you, I got you!

20:41.174 --> 20:42.173
I got you!

20:42.175 --> 20:43.407
Got your arm!

20:43.409 --> 20:44.775
I'm gonna break it.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.210
WINSTON:
Aah, that's my arm!

20:46.212 --> 20:49.080
I need it, I need it!
