NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.254 --> 00:05.336
Gold. He says there's a way
to stop Cora.

00:05.423 --> 00:08.085
It was the ink. There's a jar of it
in his cell, where we kept him.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.256
EMMA: What happened?
MARY: David.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.379
He went under a sleeping spell.
Now he's trapped.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.505
We destroyed the wardrobe.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.339
Cora gathered the ashes, she's gonna
use them to open up a portal.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.890
There â€™s an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.309
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.349
-You took her heart.
-And now you have a princess.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.475
Cora didn't see me escape.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.060
Hook. He said that if
you had trusted him...

00:26.152 --> 00:28.108
AURORA AND CORA: ...you could
have defeated Cora together.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.982
Can we get on with the business of
going to Storybrooke?

00:30.114 --> 00:31.320
All we need is the compass.

00:45.338 --> 00:47.454
Halt.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.623
Food for the prisoner.

00:50.051 --> 00:54.135
It's not meal time. Who are you?
Identify yourself, slave.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.090
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:57.558 --> 00:58.968
(BLADE ZINGS AND CLANKS)

01:01.729 --> 01:02.809
(GRUNTING)

01:04.523 --> 01:07.185
Slave? I prefer Captain.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.521
(KEYS JANGLE)

01:14.450 --> 01:15.610
You must be Belle.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.154
(DOOR CLAN KS)

01:18.579 --> 01:22.197
The Queen sent you, didn't she?
She wants you to kill me.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.245
I'm not here to kill you, love.
I'm here to rescue you.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.119
Rescue me? Who are you?

01:28.631 --> 01:29.746
A friend.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.498
We haven't much time.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.088
Your father's life is in danger.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.965
He's being attacked by
the very same monster

01:37.056 --> 01:38.921
who stole you away from your family
in the first place.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.096
(CHUCKLES) What? Rumplestiltskin?

01:40.393 --> 01:42.054
The Dark One. He must be stopped.

01:42.687 --> 01:44.518
You spent
more time with him than anyone.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.642
There are rumors of a magical weapon
that has the power to kill him.

01:47.733 --> 01:51.521
No, no, no, no. Let me talk to him.
He's not a monster.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.857
Belle, your father's life
hangs in the balance.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.985
I need to know what that weapon is
and where to find it.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.237
I don't know what you're talking about,

01:59.328 --> 02:02.991
and I have no idea how to...
How to kill Rumplestiltskin.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.537
You don't?

02:04.875 --> 02:06.456
No. And nor would I.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.041
Hmm.

02:09.005 --> 02:10.996
Then I'm afraid
I'm not here to rescue you.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.621
(GRUNTING)

02:13.676 --> 02:17.168
So pretty, yet so useless.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.336
-(WHOOSH|NG)
-(GRUNTS)

02:20.016 --> 02:21.972
No. Not useless.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.349
She's a valuable chess piece.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.064
Do I look like I'm playing
a game of chess?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.360
My hook, if you please.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.815
No.

02:37.033 --> 02:40.867
The asking was me being a gentleman.

02:40.953 --> 02:44.241
Is that any way to address a queen?

02:44.665 --> 02:48.374
Even a pirate
should have better manners than that.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.497
Yes,

02:50.963 --> 02:55.047
I know who you are, Captain.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.881
I know why
you came here from Neverland,

03:00.264 --> 03:03.973
and I know all about the crocodile
you wish to skin.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.717
Then you also know
that I'll stop at nothing.

03:06.812 --> 03:10.270
So dedicated and resourceful.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.812
No one has been able to fight their way
past my defenses before.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.985
She can't help you
kill Rumplestiltskin, Hook.

03:22.203 --> 03:26.537
But I can, if you do something for me.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.997
Care to join me for a drink?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.756
Things are about to change
in this world,

03:44.433 --> 03:46.173
radically.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.760
l have plans to enact a curse

03:50.564 --> 03:54.273
that will take everyone to a far-off land.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.317
How will that help me?

03:58.989 --> 04:03.153
This new realm,
it's a land without magic.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.286
Where the Dark One
will be stripped of his powers.

04:07.623 --> 04:11.616
There, you won't need
any magical weapons to kill him.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.537
You can do it

04:15.840 --> 04:19.332
with a mere flick of your wrist.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.084
Tell me what I have to do.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.722
There's one person I don't want
following me to this new land.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.927
You're to see to it that doesn't happen.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.636
An assassination.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.061
Who is it you want me to dispose of?

04:39.989 --> 04:41.479
My mother.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.495
(CLOCK TICKING)

05:05.723 --> 05:06.712
Any change?

05:08.058 --> 05:10.435
No, he's not improving.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.723
He needs true love's kiss.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.560
He won't wake up
until Mary Margaret comes back.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.855
Until? Well, that's rather optimistic,
isn't it?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.606
What are you talking about?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.153
They're up against your mother.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.524
The only chance Snow and Emma have
of defeating her is with the squid ink.

05:26.744 --> 05:29.156
Which is why
you sent the message through David.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.113
Which would be beneficial if we knew
that message were delivered.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.541
But, alas, given the prince's condition,
we don't know.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.329
As such, it's important
we take precautions.

05:39.423 --> 05:43.211
We have to consider the possibility
that when that portal opens,

05:43.302 --> 05:44.917
it won't be his family that come through.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.218
It'll be Cora.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.931
And neither one of us wants that.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.350
We have to find
where they're coming through,

05:57.441 --> 05:59.898
and destroy that portal.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.101
But whoever came through would die.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.185
Exactly.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.195
But I'm confident,
between the two of us,

06:05.282 --> 06:08.115
we can summon up enough magic
to complete the task.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.442
Well, what if we're wrong?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.619
What if that portal opens up
and it's not my mother?

06:13.207 --> 06:16.449
What if Mary Margaret and Emma
do defeat Cora and go through it?

06:16.544 --> 06:18.751
Well, I believe,
in this world they call that a win-win.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.380
How exactly is that?

06:20.464 --> 06:24.673
If we stop Cora, you are protected
from your mother's wrath.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.718
If, on the other hand,
we stop Snow and Emma,

06:29.056 --> 06:33.220
well, you become the only mother
in your son's life, now, don't you?

06:33.978 --> 06:36.936
Look, magic is unpredictable
in this world.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.726
If something unfortunate
were to happen

06:39.817 --> 06:42.433
while you were
attempting to help, (SCOFFS)

06:42.528 --> 06:44.018
Henry could hardly blame you for that,
could he?

06:47.032 --> 06:49.614
No. I can't lie to him.

06:49.994 --> 06:52.736
I am trying to be a better mother.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.825
You won't be able
to be a better anything

06:55.916 --> 06:57.747
if Cora comes through.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.786
And if she does,
she will be a threat to everyone,

07:02.298 --> 07:04.880
including your son.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.629
So if you truly want
to be a good mother to Henry,

07:07.720 --> 07:09.210
to protect him...

07:09.513 --> 07:12.380
If you want to be better,

07:13.475 --> 07:14.760
prove it.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.104
Huh. Rumplestiltskin's cell.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.188
I haven't been here
since before Regina's curse.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.315
This is where he told us
you were going to be the Savior.

07:28.949 --> 07:29.938
He knew?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.399
Oh, it was prophesized.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.656
Come on.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.408
The squid ink, it's not here.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.705
Gold said we would find it.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.828
Well, was there anyone else
in here with him?

07:40.919 --> 07:41.908
Could they have taken the ink?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.040
No. He was kept alone.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.246
Visitors were forbidden.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.047
He was too dangerous
to allow any human contact.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.341
-How did he keep from going crazy?
-He didn't.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.762
-What is it?
-Is it a message?

07:54.224 --> 07:56.601
Yes. And I think it's for you.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.426
Why would you think that?

08:20.417 --> 08:23.659
"With one kiss, true love's power
made everything right again.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.540
"But this was not the end of their story.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.963
"ltwasjust the beginning."

08:30.094 --> 08:32.927
I think this time
it'll happen the other way around.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.046
You think so?

08:36.141 --> 08:37.756
I do.

08:40.813 --> 08:45.056
Which is why I need you to stay here
and watch David for a little while.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.936
Where are you going?

08:48.112 --> 08:51.570
Mr. Gold and I need to prepare
for Emma and Mary Margaret's return.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.117
Coming through the portal
won't be easy.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.696
We need to make sure
everything's in place.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.073
Really? You're really gonna help them?

08:59.331 --> 09:03.825
I promised you l was going to do better,
to be better.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.077
So, yes,

09:06.296 --> 09:10.039
I'm going to do everything in my power
to see to it they come home safely.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.877
You really have changed.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.472
I'll be back as soon as I can.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.819
I'm really glad you, uh,
came to your senses.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.815
Let's just get this over with.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.943
It's right through here.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.155
Ah, yes. Should suit our purposes, no?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.161
How much do we need?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.334
(SCOFFS) All of it.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.288
How are we going to do that?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.794
With a little help from a fairy.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.250
A dead one.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.087
Believe me, no one mourns her.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.726
(WHOOSHING)

10:07.983 --> 10:10.019
Oh, yeah.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.697
-|t's now enchanted.
-(CLlCKlNG)

10:21.622 --> 10:24.830
It will enable you to rip out her heart.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.375
I believe you've seen it done before.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.043
Yes.

10:30.881 --> 10:35.215
The enchantment will only allow you
to rip out one heart.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.552
So make sure you do it right.

10:38.806 --> 10:42.139
What could she have possibly done
to warrant such brutality?

10:42.226 --> 10:43.966
That's my business.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.560
Yours is to kill her
and bring her body back to me.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.392
Easy enough.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.475
When do I set forth
on this murderous journey?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.734
Immediately.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.404
But you won't be going alone.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.909
You remember Claude?

11:06.667 --> 11:07.907
Can't say that I do.

11:08.252 --> 11:11.164
You killed him in the cell block.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.581
Ah, yes. I didn't recognize him
without my hook in his neck.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.546
Forgive me,
but isn't he a bit of dead weight?

11:19.763 --> 11:23.255
l banished my mother
to a far-off land some time ago.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.555
You're gonna need a portal to get to her.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.434
The rules are simple,

11:32.734 --> 11:34.190
one goes in, one comes back.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.894
Or in this case, two in, two back.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.521
You'll arrive with Claude,

11:38.615 --> 11:42.073
and you'll return with my mother.

11:43.245 --> 11:47.955
Now, tell me, which far-off land do I
have the pleasure of visiting today?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.954
VVondedand.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.125
Aptly named, I'm sure.
How will I find her?

11:56.258 --> 11:59.045
Oh, don't worry. She'll find you.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.737
Kneel before the Queen of Hearts.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.332
I appreciate the warm welcome.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.747
(WHISPERING)
Why has he come to Wonderland?

12:35.172 --> 12:37.584
The Queen wants to know
why you've come to Wonderland.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.335
I'm in search of someone.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.176
In her native land she goes by Cora.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.212
(MURMURING)

12:45.432 --> 12:48.515
In this land, she goes by Your Majesty.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.767
Leave us.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.527
Your name, pirate?

13:01.615 --> 13:02.980
Hook.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.198
What a clever nickname.

13:07.204 --> 13:11.163
I come bearing gifts, if you'll allow me.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.831
This hat, your portal.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.452
If I understand correctly,

13:17.547 --> 13:20.914
the same number who travels
through must also return.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.129
You arrived with him.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.506
But who shall you return with?

13:26.181 --> 13:27.216
(NECKLACE CLATTERS)

13:27.307 --> 13:28.296
You.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.468
(SQUISH)

13:32.980 --> 13:33.969
What?

13:34.064 --> 13:36.305
I'm the Queen of Hearts.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.560
Do you really think I'd be so careless

13:37.651 --> 13:40.267
as to keep my heart
where everyone else does?

13:40.362 --> 13:41.852
-This...
-(GROANS)

13:42.155 --> 13:43.235
(SQUlSHlNG)

13:44.366 --> 13:46.106
...is how it's done.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.829

Who sent you here to kill me?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.577
Your daughter.

13:58.255 --> 14:03.215
Regina? She wants me dead?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.130
You're now going to tell me everything

14:09.224 --> 14:11.385
and do exactly what I want.

14:11.476 --> 14:15.469
Because when you hold a heart,
you control it.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.017
CORA: You have the power.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.943
What does this even mean?

14:23.030 --> 14:26.022
He was obsessed with you, Emma.
You were the key to breaking the curse.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.448
We've looked everywhere.
There's no ink in this cell.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.526
No, there has to be. He told David.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.453
You were in a nethen/vorld. Maybe
something got lost in translation.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.456
No. She heard right.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.620
You found it?

14:37.711 --> 14:41.044
In a manner of speaking.
There was ink in this cell.

Ah.

No. No.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.054
Don't waste your energy, dear.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.231
Rumplestiltskin himself
couldn't escape from this cell.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.904
Thank you, Aurora.
We couldn't have done it without you.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.237
-Why would you do this?
-How could you?

15:08.158 --> 15:11.321
(CHUCKLES) Don't blame her.
She was only doing what she was told.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.401
(BEATING)

15:13.497 --> 15:14.737
You took her heart.

15:14.831 --> 15:18.289
Actually, I did. It was a gift.

(AURORA GROANS)

15:22.464 --> 15:26.958
Forgive us. We'd love to stay,
but Storybrooke awaits.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.171
Hook, wait.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.680
Please don't do this. My son
is in Storybrooke. He needs me.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.353
Perhaps you should
have considered that

15:40.482 --> 15:42.848
before you abandoned me
on that beanstalk.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.690
You would have done the same.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.855
Actually, no.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.693
Do you know what this is, Emma?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.161
The bean that the giant kept.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.369
Uh-uh-uh.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.123
Yes, indeed.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.792
A pirate always keeps a souvenir
of his conquests.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.713
But this, well,
this is much more than a mere trinket.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.126
This is a symbol,
something that was once magical,

16:11.221 --> 16:14.338
full of hope and possibility. Mmm.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.475
Now look at it. Dried up, dead, useless.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.557
Much like you.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.233
The time for making deals is done.

All the magic
has been drained from the mines.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.095
They stole it?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.351
They snuck in after our shift
and took everything.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.182
Nobody steals from a dwarf.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.266
Except the Queen.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.612
And Rumplestiltskin.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.614
If they're not helping
Emma and Mary Margaret,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.534
that means my mom lied to me.

This is my fault.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.556
No, it's mine.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.813
Cora stole your heart
because I failed to protect you.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.146
That's very sweet,
but I believe it's my fault.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.816
I'm the Savior,
and I'm not doing much saving, am I?

18:05.794 --> 18:08.581

Good always defeats evil.

You sound like Henry.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.675
Guess optimism runs in the family.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.844
I think it skipped a generation.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.924
You should know better than anybody.
You broke the curse.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.680
What have I done since then?

18:24.813 --> 18:27.020
I got us stranded over here,
burned down the wardrobe,

18:27.107 --> 18:29.598
let Cora get the ash
and now the compass.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.024
The only reason I ever broke the curse

18:31.111 --> 18:33.352
is because it was exactly
what Gold wanted me to do.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.186
I had nothing to do with it.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.271
What are you talking about?

18:36.366 --> 18:38.607
He told you l was the Savior.
It was his plan.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.033
Once I fulfilled that role,

18:40.328 --> 18:41.943
maybe that's all l was ever meant to do.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.619
Everything I've ever done,

18:43.707 --> 18:46.949
he had it all mapped out
before I was even born.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.956

its waters hold the power

19:14.195 --> 19:17.153
to restore what was once lost.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.903
It will return magic
to what remains of this wardrobe.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.242
And then we'll be able to cross worlds.

how do you expect to kill someone

But if you do what I say,

21:06.599 --> 21:09.511
I'll make sure you not only kill him,

every single moment.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.125
Wouldn't it have been easier
to reconcile with her

24:27.216 --> 24:29.878
before her curse destroys the land?

24:30.386 --> 24:32.297
Regina doesn't need me.

24:32.388 --> 24:36.131
Not now.
Not when she thinks she's about to win.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.891
But I still have a place in her heart.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.061
And the curse won't last forever.
It will end.

You'll be frozen, like all those
in this corner of the land.

our quest will resume.

24:59.415 --> 25:04.250

Regina will truly have lost everything.

When I was a little girl
I used to sneak into Cora's chamber

26:03.312 --> 26:05.473
and watch her practice magic.

26:06.441 --> 26:11.606
She had a spell book and, Emma,
the spells were in the book.

Yeah. Isn't that what a spell book is?

29:46.202 --> 29:48.284
-Go.
-No, but you need the compass.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.360
And Aurora needs her heart.

29:51.874 --> 29:54.661
Take it. It deflects her magic.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.372
I had no idea you had such a soft side.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.127
I don't. I just like a fair fight.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.046
Good form. But not good enough.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.887
(WHISTLING)

30:17.733 --> 30:18.813
(CHUCKUNG)

30:22.738 --> 30:26.822
Normally I prefer to do other,
more enjoyable, activities

30:26.909 --> 30:29.070
with a woman on her back.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.652
But with my life on the line,
you've left me no choice.

30:31.872 --> 30:32.907
Bit of advice.

30:33.249 --> 30:36.082
When I jab you with my sword,
you'll feel it.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.999
You might want to quit.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.043
Why would I do that?
When I'm winning.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.588
(BOTH GRUNTING)

30:46.262 --> 30:47.843
Thanks.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.759
Now, let's go home!

31:00.109 --> 31:01.098
Mom?

31:05.865 --> 31:08.026
You're not helping
Emma and Mary Margaret, are you?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.951
I'm helping you, Henry.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.528
What are you talking about?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.123
You're gonna kill them.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.196
Sorry, dearie.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.789
Mom, what are you doing?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.963
We can't let Cora
come through the portal.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.883
You have no idea
what she would do to us.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.210
Emma and Mary Margaret
are going to defeat her.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.717
They're the ones
that are gonna come through.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.718
Henry, your mother's right.
It's gonna be Cora.

31:33.809 --> 31:37.722
No, it won't. Good always defeats evil.

31:38.481 --> 31:40.642
You should know that
more than anyone.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.143
What I know is my mother will destroy

31:46.822 --> 31:49.564
everything I love.

31:50.493 --> 31:52.154
And that means you.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.781
And I can't let that happen.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.414
Emma, run.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.088
Why do you want to go to Storybrooke?

32:14.475 --> 32:16.306
Because my daughter needs me.

32:16.936 --> 32:20.349
And now I'm going to give her
the one thing she's always wanted.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.350
Your heart.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.266
Goodbye, Snow.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.856
-No.
-Emma!

32:27.988 --> 32:30.024
Oh, you foolish girl.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.775
Don't you know? Love is weakness.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.160
No,

32:46.966 --> 32:48.206
it's strength.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.714
What was that?

33:00.020 --> 33:04.730
That is a great subject for discussion,
when we get home.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.564
Come on. Ready?

33:09.697 --> 33:11.653
Yeah. Let's go.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.156
You can't! Stop it!

33:15.911 --> 33:20.826
You can't! You're gonna kill them!
Please! No!

33:28.090 --> 33:30.081
They're going to make it through!

33:30.217 --> 33:33.755
We have to turn it off!
You're gonna kill them!

33:34.388 --> 33:35.594
Henry!

33:38.392 --> 33:39.677
What are you doing?

33:39.768 --> 33:42.601
Emma and Mary Margaret
are going to come through.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.019
I know it.

33:44.106 --> 33:47.940
You said you wanted to change,
to be better.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.609
This is how.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.112
You want me to have faith in you?

33:54.241 --> 33:56.106
Have faith in me.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.164
Regina!

34:36.116 --> 34:37.981
No!

34:38.452 --> 34:41.159
I'm sorry, Henry.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.238
I'm sorry.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.757
Mom?

35:01.308 --> 35:02.423
-Henry!
-Mom!

35:05.187 --> 35:06.302
I missed you.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.603
I missed you, too.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.726
I missed you so much.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.033
What's going on? What happened?

35:24.039 --> 35:25.904
She saved you. She saved both of you.

35:27.543 --> 35:28.658
Thank you.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.663
You're welcome.

35:30.754 --> 35:31.914
Are you okay?

35:32.840 --> 35:33.875
Hey.

35:34.508 --> 35:37.341
Where's my husband?
I need to find him.

35:41.890 --> 35:42.970
Um...

35:43.350 --> 35:45.386
Your mom, she's...

35:45.477 --> 35:48.514
She's a piece of work, you know?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.689
Indeed,|do.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.936
Welcome back.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.820
Thanks.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.360
-(DOOR OPENS)
-(BELL TINKLES)

36:05.456 --> 36:06.445
David!

36:27.603 --> 36:28.718
(GASPING)

36:34.401 --> 36:35.641
You...

36:36.445 --> 36:37.525
You did it.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.986
Did you ever doubt I would?

36:41.033 --> 36:42.773
No.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.957
Though the burning red room
did give me pause.

37:05.682 --> 37:06.808
We need to talk.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.804
Yes. I believe apologies are in order.

37:10.604 --> 37:13.186
No. No apology is necessary.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.764
I understand why you wanted to
keep Cora out of here.

37:16.527 --> 37:19.485
Just remind me never to bet against you
in the future, Miss Swan.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.527
It's not really a bet
when the game is rigged, is it?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.898
To what exactly are you referring?

37:23.992 --> 37:27.120
Your scroll. I saw it in your cell.

37:27.788 --> 37:31.576
You wrote my name again,
and again, and again.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.248
Ijust wanted to make sure
it would stick.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.452
The ink, it was there all the time.
You could have gotten out.

37:36.547 --> 37:38.629
I was exactly where I wanted to be.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.333
You needed to find that.
So all of this could occur.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.715
You created the curse, Gold.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.296
You made me the Savior.

37:47.808 --> 37:49.514
So everything I've ever done,

37:51.061 --> 37:53.097
it's exactly what you wanted me to do.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.055
I created the curse, dearie,
but I didn't make you.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.441
I merely took advantage of
what you are.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.941
The product of true love.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.407
That's why you're powerful.

38:08.078 --> 38:11.821
And everything you've done,
you've done yourself.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.994
So you don't know.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.003
Know what?

38:22.134 --> 38:26.753
Cora tried to rip my heart out,
but she couldn't.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.383
She was blasted back
with something inside me.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.264
By...

38:32.978 --> 38:33.967
By...

38:34.062 --> 38:35.643
By magic.

38:36.148 --> 38:39.015
Whatever that was, I didn't do that.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.732
You did.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.071
(BEATING)

38:47.534 --> 38:49.070
Have you done this before?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.360
No.

38:57.544 --> 38:58.624
(GRUNTING)

39:04.760 --> 39:05.920
(GASPING)

39:14.186 --> 39:15.551
Thank you.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.515
What now?

39:18.815 --> 39:20.100
Cora told me something.

39:21.068 --> 39:24.356
When a wraith consumes a soul,
it's not trapped there forever.

39:25.322 --> 39:27.358
It can be reunited with its body.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.148
You think we can save Phillip?

39:29.243 --> 39:30.278
We can try.

39:30.494 --> 39:31.574
Then let's try.

39:42.589 --> 39:43.749
(HOOK SIGHS)

39:44.424 --> 39:45.834
We failed.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.749
Really, Cora.

39:48.470 --> 39:51.678
After all this time,
why do you still doubt me?

39:53.392 --> 39:56.429
But that bean is petrified. It's useless.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.512
But these waters
have regenerative properties.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.140
Perhaps it's time to do some gardening.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.405
I was right.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.077
You really have changed.

40:24.006 --> 40:25.371
Thank you.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.142
Emma.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.842
Well, it looks like
we have some catching up to do.

40:38.979 --> 40:41.220
You have no idea.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.857
How about dinner at Granny's? On me.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.144
As long as it's not Chimera, I'm in.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.483
(ALL LAUGHING)

40:47.029 --> 40:48.985
Hey, kid, you hungry?

40:50.699 --> 40:51.984
Yeah.

40:54.328 --> 40:56.535
I'll see you later.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.166
Congratulations.

41:10.552 --> 41:13.214
You just reunited mother and son.

41:14.556 --> 41:19.016
Maybe one day
they'll even invite you for dinner.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.189
There it is.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.231
Storybrooke.
