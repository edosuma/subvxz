00:15.500 --> 00:17.800
Previously on 24

00:18.100 --> 00:20.300
I need karen hayes to go away.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.400
I understand,sir.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.200
I need the president to sign off on my proposals.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.200
She's gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.100
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence,

00:30.100 --> 00:31.400
and your covering it up.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.100
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.900
Your resignation within the hour.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.300
Mr.President,I am tendering my resignation.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.500
Is there anything I can do to change your mind?

00:42.700 --> 00:44.200
No,sir,there is not.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.500
Walid has earned their trust.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.500
These men know something  about
the bombs that we don'T.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.500
I don't think these guys you're tracking
are connected to anyone.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.700
They're not terrorists.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.600
I'm getting walid the hell out of there.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.400
You spied on us?

00:57.900 --> 00:59.600
You're worse than they are!

00:59.700 --> 01:01.100
Son of a bitch!

01:06.000 --> 01:10.800
a nuclear bomb just went off,like,
25  miles from here.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.800
When I'm done with this deal,

01:12.800 --> 01:14.900
I may just buy you a small country.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.200
Have you found an engineer?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.200
I told you I'd find someone and I will.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.900
It's just taking longer.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.000
start talking,gray!

01:22.500 --> 01:23.800
I made a mess.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.500
Dad's trying to clean it up.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.300
What happened?

01:27.600 --> 01:30.500
I hired mccarthy to oversee the job,but...

01:30.500 --> 01:32.500
so the nukes that these terrorist
are in possession of,

01:32.500 --> 01:34.900
including the one that was just
detonated in valencia,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.300
was supplied by mccarthy and stolen from you.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.300
Yes.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.400
I'm heading to mccarthy's office in simi valley.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
We have teams standing by.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
Let me know.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.400
Stop.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
He's my son.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.700
What are you doing here,jack?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.600
Jack: I know what you're trying to cover up,dad.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.000
Gray already told me.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.900
Mccarthy's not here.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.300
Hey,what are you doing?

01:58.300 --> 01:59.300
Put the gun down!

01:59.400 --> 02:00.700
You work for me.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.300
No,dad,he doesn'T.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.600
You don't think I'd let you run loose without
keeping an eye on you,do you?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.000
This is insane.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.800
********

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I am at the edge of the safe zone.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.400
Behind me is the nuclear blast.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.200
Emergency medical teams are being
overwhelmed by the number of injured.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.100
In what president palmer has confirmed was

02:38.200 --> 02:43.300
a tactical nuclear weapon detonated
just a little over two hours ago

02:43.400 --> 02:46.400
in this valencia neighborhood
north of los angeles,

02:46.500 --> 02:51.900
more than 12,000 people are
estimated to have perished in the blast.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.100
Lapd is spread thin,but on an encouraging note,

02:55.200 --> 02:57.200
we've heard that they are receiving a flood...

02:57.300 --> 02:59.500
I just heard about karen's resignation.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.900
I'm sorry for the loss.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.500
Are you really sorry,tom?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.800
Because your words seemed somewhat hollow to me.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.500
It's no secret karen and i butted
heads the last few weeks.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.800
Nevertheless,I respected her as an adversary.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.700
She never gave me a concrete
reason why she resigned,

03:15.800 --> 03:17.000
but there was something...

03:17.400 --> 03:18.700
something she wasn't telling me.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
This may have something to do with it.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.500
This is a draft of the executive order
I presented this morning.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.900
Karen found out I was going to resubmit
it to you for your authorization.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.100
And so she quit?

03:32.100 --> 03:33.900
That makes absolutely no sense to me,tom.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.800
She's never been afraid of a fight.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.400
maybe she finally realized her
arguments are invalid and that

03:39.500 --> 03:43.000
this is the only possible response
to the danger we're facing.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.600
You want to tell me why I would sign off on
something that I rejected six hours ago?

03:46.700 --> 03:48.300
Because,sir,six hours ago,

03:48.400 --> 03:49.900
we didn't know fayed had nukes.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.400
Even so,tom,you're talking
about suspending habeas corpus,

03:53.500 --> 03:57.900
extending the length and broadening
the criteria for those detention centers.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.500
Those actions will constitute a
brazen abuse of executive power.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.400
Those actions will degrade fayed's network,

04:04.500 --> 04:08.600
limiting his ability to make use of
these remaining nuclear weapons.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.600
Sir,fayed's sole intention here is the
destruction of our country,

04:13.700 --> 04:16.000
its infrastructure,social order,

04:16.100 --> 04:20.300
entire way of life,and he's got the will
and means to make good on that threat.

04:20.399 --> 04:24.800
Tom,have you stopped to think about the fact I
would be forcing the people who elected me

04:24.900 --> 04:28.300
to give up the rights and freedoms that
define the essence of this country?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.700
Sir,if one more nuke goes off,

04:30.800 --> 04:34.400
it would have been fayed who's
redefined our country.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.400 --> 04:53.100
Pass this out to the cabinet.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.100
We'll convene in 30 minutes.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.300
You're doing the right thing,mr.President.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.600
Reed.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.300
Call the cabinet in for an emergency session.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.200
Tell general white we're ramping up.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.000
Does that mean the president
is signing off on this?

05:15.100 --> 05:17.400
He wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.700
Good work,reed.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.600
Well,I'm just doing what needs to be done,sir.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.700
Getting rid of karen is distinctly unpleasant,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.600
but she left us no choicE.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.500
hayes.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.000
Girl,I'm sorry I'm late with the briefing.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.300
Tell the president we're still tracking
fayed through mccarthy.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.300
Bill,I've just had to resign.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.000
Resign?What are you talking about?

05:38.100 --> 05:39.700
Can't get into it right now,

05:39.800 --> 05:42.700
but I've asked to be reassigned to
cut as an on-site liaison.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.300
Karen,you can't leave the
president today, of all days.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.400
Bill,do you think that I would do
this if I had any other choice?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
Lennox has something to do with this,doesn't he?

05:51.900 --> 05:54.200
I cannot talk about this right now.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.300
I will see you in a few hours.Okay?

05:56.300 --> 05:57.200
Karen?

06:30.000 --> 06:30.700
mr.Buchanan.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.900
What is it,chloe?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
I've been trying to reach jack on his cell phone;

06:33.200 --> 06:34.400
he's not answering.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
Try his backup teams.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.200
I tried; they're not answering either.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.100
Maybe he had them all go dark.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.600
He wouldn't do that without telling us first.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.800
Send in the support units,see
if they can get a visual.

06:44.900 --> 06:45.400
All right.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.000
And keep trying jack.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.100
******

06:50.100 --> 06:51.900
So after we're done,where do
you want us to meet you?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.900
I'll be here another hour dumping hard drives.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.700
We'll meet you back at the house,then.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.000
Just make sure it goes exactly according to plan.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.200
Don't worry.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.400
It's my job to worry.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.000
it was all for you,jack.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.300
Everything I worked for,everything I built--

07:12.600 --> 07:13.700
it was all for you.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.800
After you left,I tried to convince myself that
graem was capable of heading the family...

07:21.100 --> 07:22.800
protecting the company

07:24.500 --> 07:25.600
I guess,

07:25.800 --> 07:27.900
on some level,I always knew the truth about him.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.800
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.600
I don't know what you want me to say.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.700
I want you to understand that

07:40.000 --> 07:42.700
after you left,graem was all I had.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.100
I pushed you away,didn't I?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.700
I'm really sorry.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.700
get out.

08:20.900 --> 08:21.700
Come on.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.299
Don't do this,sir.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.100
Whatever graem's paying you,I'll double it.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.200
Just keep it moving.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.500
Get down on your knees,both of you.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.800
No.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
You son of a bitch.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.300
At least have the guts to look me in the eye.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.900
I needed to question him.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.300
They were gonna kill us,jack.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.200
Search his pockets for the keys.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.300
Damn it!

09:36.000 --> 09:36.600
*****

09:36.700 --> 09:37.700
Bill,it's jack.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.700
Jack,we haven't been able to reach you.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.500
Are you all right?

09:40.600 --> 09:43.800
Yeah,I'm fine,but all the members of
the backup team have been killed.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Have you found mccarthy?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.300
Not yet,but I know how to get to hiM.

09:47.400 --> 09:47.900
How?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.100
My brother.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.900
You said your brother wasn't involved
when mccarthy brokered the nukes.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.100
He lied to mE.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.100
He didn't tell us everything.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.400
Based on what?

09:56.700 --> 09:58.700
He just tried to have me and my father killed.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.300
Bill,I need you to set up a perimeter
around his house.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.700
I'll send a field team right away.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.400
Have them do an immediate recon,
confirm that he's there.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.300
I want burke standing by with
an interrogation kit.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.000
Jack.

10:09.100 --> 10:09.600
What?

10:09.700 --> 10:12.400
As it stands now,mccarthy is
our only lead to fayed.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.100
We need to find fayed before he arms the nukes.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.700
I'll get back to you as soon as I make
contact with the field team.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.600
We need to go.

10:25.900 --> 10:26.800
rita.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.400
Where do you think you're going?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
I'm hungry.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.300
There's a candy machine in the lobby.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.700
Don't worry.We'll be leaving soon.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.200
You said that an our ago.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.600
Sit down,rita.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.400
Yes?

10:49.700 --> 10:50.700
Good news.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.300
I found someone to program the
trigger codes for your bombs.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.300
Who?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
I've just you sent his profile,

10:57.600 --> 11:00.400
employment record,education,
the whole curriculum vitae.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.900
You should have it on your screen.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.600
I'm looking at it now.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.000
He seems qualified.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.700
Oh,he'll get the job done,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.300
but he won't work willingly.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.500
He'll need to be coerced.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.800
Okay,when will you have him?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.100
Within the hour.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.400
Call me when you do.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.700
mr.Buchanan,

11:28.300 --> 11:29.400
you need to listen to this.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.000
What?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.700
Nsa intercepted a stream of chatter--

11:31.800 --> 11:33.700
part of it's an audio recording.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.100
They've identified one of the voices
as belonging to fayed.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
Let's hear it.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.700
Good news.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.400
I found someone to program
the trigger codes on your bombs.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.400
Who?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.200
I've just sent you his profile,

11:44.300 --> 11:47.100
employment record,education,
the whole curriculum vitae.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.100
It should be on your screen.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.900
I'm looking at it now.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
He seems qualified.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.300
he'll get the job done,

11:52.400 --> 11:53.700
but he won't work willingly.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.900
He'll need to be coerced.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.200
Okay,when will you have him?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.000
Within the hour.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.400
Call me when you do.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.200
Second voice matches the sample
we pulled off mccarthy's voice-mail.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.000
They lost numair in the explosion,

12:05.100 --> 12:07.700
so mccarthy found someone else to arm the nukes.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.400
Send the file to audio forensics.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.200
Have them scan for any background
artifacts that could give us a location.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.500
Yes,sir.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.100
I had morris working on something,too.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.700
We also found an image file
inside the data stream.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.200
Nsa thinks it might be a photo of the engineer.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.300
Is this it?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.200
Yeah,it got all corrupted during the intercept.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.500
I'm writing a salvage utility.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.900
I should have a new code in a second.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.300
Getting an image of the engineer may be our
only way of stopping those nukes.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
Give me an estimate.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.400
Well,that's hard to say.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.300
Could be ten minutes,it could be an hour.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.700
********

12:42.500 --> 12:43.900
Who's the agent in charge?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.600
My name is jack bauer.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.300
Mr.Bauer,I'm hal turner.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.300
I'll be on point.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.200
Are your men in position?

12:50.300 --> 12:50.800
Yes,sir.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.200
We've sealed off a one-block radius,

12:52.300 --> 12:54.700
and our recon has confirmed
your brother's inside--

12:54.800 --> 12:56.500
his wife and son are in there as well.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.600
I want you to inform your team
to use nonlethal force.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.100
We need to take my brother alive.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
Understood.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.000
Let me go in with you.

13:04.100 --> 13:04.700
No.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.000
You wait here.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.000
I need to question graem alone.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.900
What are you gonna do to him?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.800
Whatever it takes to find out what he knows.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.900
I'm not stupid,graem--

13:21.000 --> 13:22.200
I know something is wrong.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.800
Everything's fine,marilyn.

13:23.900 --> 13:24.700
You're a lousy liar.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.700
You always have been.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.700
You know,if you insist on being here,

13:26.800 --> 13:27.600
why don't you make some coffee?

13:27.700 --> 13:29.000
Why don't you make your own coffee!

13:29.100 --> 13:30.900
Will you two stop fighting?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.700
That's all you guys ever do is fight.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.600
I'm sorry,honey.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.000
We're just all a little tense today.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
What's going on?

13:43.000 --> 13:43.900
Nothing.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.000
Nothing.Why don't,

13:45.100 --> 13:46.700
why don't we leave your father alone.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.400
He needs to work.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.500
put the weapon down!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.000
Drop the gun!

13:57.100 --> 13:58.700
What the hell is this,jack?!

13:58.800 --> 14:00.100
Put it down!

14:05.500 --> 14:06.600
Do it.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.300
Get on the floor!

14:12.900 --> 14:14.300
Take it easy,jack!

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
I want you take him into the next room,

14:15.700 --> 14:17.000
have burke prep him for questioning.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.000
I want every hard drive,

14:18.100 --> 14:21.100
every memory stick in this house
uploaded and sent over to ctu.

14:21.200 --> 14:21.700
Pick him up.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.800
Go.Go.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.500
What are you doing to my dad?

14:26.600 --> 14:28.000
Josh,I'll explain as soon as I can,

14:28.100 --> 14:29.600
but right now I need to speak to your mother.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.100
Please,just take a seat.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.700
Please,son,come on.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.900
Let's go.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.100
Let go of me!

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
stop looking at me like this has
something to do with us,

14:50.100 --> 14:51.400
because it doesn'T.

14:51.700 --> 14:54.000
Graem just tried to have me and our father killed.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.000
Why?

14:55.100 --> 14:56.600
Why would he try and kill you?

14:56.700 --> 14:58.800
They nuclear bomb that was
detonated earlier today--

14:58.900 --> 15:01.700
the terrorists acquired it
from the family's company!

15:01.800 --> 15:03.700
Gray's been trying to cover it up.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.000
I'm sorry,marilyn.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.700
I understand how difficult this
must be for you to believe.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
It's not.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.800
I may not know the details of what he's done,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.000
but I know what he's capable of.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.500
There are four more other bombs out there.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.300
We need to get them back--

15:21.400 --> 15:23.100
is there anything that you can tell me?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.100
Like what?

15:24.200 --> 15:26.400
Did gray talk about a man named mccarthy?

15:26.800 --> 15:27.300
No.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.500
Are you sure?

15:29.300 --> 15:31.900
He hasn't confided in me in years.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.200
He probably never did.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.000
Marilyn,thousands of lives are at stake.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.200
Please,just think.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.900
I wish I knew something,I really wish I did,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.700
but I don't know anything.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.600
And josh doesn't know anything,either,

15:42.700 --> 15:43.900
and he doesn't need to know.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.400
I'll do everything I can to protect him.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.400
No!

15:48.300 --> 15:50.900
I've seen what happens when
you try and protect people.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.500
I just want to get my son,

15:52.600 --> 15:54.400
and I want to get out of here!

15:56.000 --> 15:56.800
Marilyn...

15:56.900 --> 15:59.300
sir,we found two computers,
both linked to one network.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.300
He was trying to erase files--

16:00.400 --> 16:01.900
we're sending what's left over to ctu.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.100
Okay,good.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.000
My sister-in-law and my nephew
don't need to stay here.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.100
Have them transported back to ctu.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.700
They can be debriefed there.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
Yes,sir.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.000
Mrs.Bauer.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.400
We're taking you and your son back to ctu.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.100
Josh?

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
Grandpa.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.800
You okay?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.200
Not really.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.800
Wait in the car,baby.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.300
Jack told me what graem did,

17:00.500 --> 17:02.200
what he was involved with.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.700
Is it true?

17:06.099 --> 17:08.000
It's complicated.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.200
But it's true.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.099
You make sure he keeps josh out of this.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.100
I panicked,jack.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.100
That's all there is to it.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
You panicked?

17:46.600 --> 17:47.900
That's your excuse?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.200
You panicked?!

17:49.300 --> 17:51.300
You tried to kill me and our father.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.200
I was backed into a corner.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.300
I was just protecting my ass.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.700
You knew about a tactical nuclear
weapon on american soil.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.900
You are responsible for the death of
thousands and thousands of people.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.700
You think I really wanted
that bomb to go off,jack?

18:03.800 --> 18:06.600
I think you knew more about
mccarthy than you told me.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.900
How do i find him?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.100
I don't have a clue.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.500
How do i find him?!

18:11.500 --> 18:12.900
I just told you I don't know.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.300
There are four more bombs out there.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.300
This isn't a joke,gray.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.300
Tell me now,how do I find mccarthy?

18:22.300 --> 18:24.200
I told you everything I know,jack.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.800
respiration and temperature patterns indicate
deception,especially his last reply.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.800
Set up the interrogation package.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.300
You don't want to make me do this,gray.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.400
We grew up together,jack.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.000
In all those years,I could never make you
do anything you didn't want to do.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.700
I need to talk to you.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.400
What is it?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.300
Over here.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.100
It's morris's brother.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Timothy?

19:29.400 --> 19:31.600
He's on his way to horizon regional hospital.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.000
On-site paramedics confirmed he
has severe radiation exposure.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.100
It says he's in critical condition.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.300
I'll tell him.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.700
Wait,chloe.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.000
I think we should hold off.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.100
Why?

19:48.100 --> 19:50.700
Morris is the best hope we have
for restoring that file.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
If we drop this on him now,

19:51.900 --> 19:53.300
he might completely shut down.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.300
It's his brother-- we can't keep it a secret.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.600
I understand.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.000
This might sound insensitive,but for a second,

20:00.100 --> 20:03.100
put aside your personal feelings for
morris and consider what's at stake.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
We need him to finish
writing that salvage utility.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.100
I know morris; he can handle it.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.500
I hope so.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.000
Morris?

20:21.100 --> 20:22.100
Yes,darling?

20:24.100 --> 20:25.600
I have some bad news.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.400
It's about timothy--

20:27.500 --> 20:29.400
he's been taken to the hospital.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.900
I'm sorry.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.600
Well,this can't be right--

20:33.700 --> 20:35.000
it says he was pulled...

20:35.700 --> 20:38.800
from his car by rescue workers
just north of valencia.

20:41.400 --> 20:41.900
Operator.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.500
Yes,could you connect me with horizon
regional hospital,please?

20:44.600 --> 20:46.800
-******* -What was he doing in valencia?

20:46.900 --> 20:48.700
I'm sorry,sir,all circuits are busy.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.600
Yes,I realize that the lines are busy--

20:50.700 --> 20:52.000
this is ctu,los angeles,calling--

20:52.100 --> 20:53.200
I need an emergency breakthrough.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.700
- I cannot help you at this time,sir.
- I know...

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Sorry.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.000
I-I have to go out there.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.600
Morris,hey,

21:06.700 --> 21:07.800
I know it's hard,okay?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.400
But we are in the middle of a crisis.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.300
We need to find the engineer before fayed does.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.500
You can't just leave.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.400
You can't expect me to sit there when my
little brother is dying in the hospital.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.700
I'm sorry,milo.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.900
Morris...

21:21.000 --> 21:22.100
listen.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.100
12,000 people are dead.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.000
If fayed finds an engineer,
it'll be many,many more.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
Four bombs is about a million people.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.600
Think about this.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.600
You can finish writing the program--

21:35.700 --> 21:36.300
you can do it.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.800
Yes,I can-- but you started already.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.400
It will take me half an hour to
figure out what you've done.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.900
You need to stay here and do your job.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.800
Please.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.000
Okay.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.800
Thanks.

22:02.200 --> 22:02.800
Buchanan.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.100
Bill,it's jack.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.800
Did chloe pull anything off the hard drives?

22:05.900 --> 22:07.300
No,she came up empty.

22:07.400 --> 22:11.500
But 15 minutes ago,the nsa picked up a
conversation between mccarthy and fayed.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.700
*******Mccarthy's found another engineer
to arm the four remaining nukes.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.400
He's delivering the engineer within the hour.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.500
The nukes could be operational within 45 minutes?

22:19.600 --> 22:20.200
That's right.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.600
I'll get back to you.

22:33.700 --> 22:37.500
Ctu just confirmed that mccarthy is
looking for an engineer for fayed.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
They're gonna arm the nukes.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.800
Then you're wasting time talking to me,jack.

22:40.900 --> 22:41.800
You're holding something back.

22:41.900 --> 22:42.900
That machine doesn't lie.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.500
Then it must be broken because
I've told you everything I know.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.900
That's hyocine-pentothal.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.300
It's a neuro-inflamatory,designed to induce pain.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.000
All you have to do to stop me from
using it is tell me how to find mccarthy.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.900
Your guess is as good as mine.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.800
Two cc'S.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.700
come on,come on.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.600
I can take this to seven cc'S.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.200
You will experience pain I can't even describe.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.100
At eight cc's,I run the risk of
inducing a heart attack.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.100
Gray...

23:51.700 --> 23:54.300
make no mistake about it,
I will go there if I have to.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.800
Please,just tell me what I need to know.

23:58.300 --> 23:59.000
Please.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.400
I don't want to hurt you.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.800
You sure about that,jack?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.600
Please,gray,just tell me what I need to know.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.100
How do I find mccarthy?!

24:10.200 --> 24:11.100
Do it.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.200
Two cc'S.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.400
breathe.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.600
Just breathe.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.000
Just breathe.

24:31.000 --> 24:31.900
Please...

24:32.800 --> 24:34.500
just tell me what I need to know.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.800
How do I find mccarthy?!

24:38.700 --> 24:40.500
Damn you.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Four cc'S.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.300
That's eight cc's total,jack.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.800
His vitals are spiking across the line.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.700
Four cc's!

24:45.800 --> 24:47.100
Jack,don'T.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.400
The machine knows you're lying!

24:49.500 --> 24:51.000
I know you're lying!

24:51.100 --> 24:54.300
Tell me the truth!

25:05.500 --> 25:07.700
it has nothing to do with mccarthy.

25:07.700 --> 25:12.200
it has to do with palmer.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.200
David palmer?

25:13.300 --> 25:14.300
Yes.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.700
I gave the order for his assassination.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.100
And agent tony almeida...

25:21.200 --> 25:24.000
and agent michelle dessler--

25:24.700 --> 25:26.200
your co-workers--

25:26.300 --> 25:28.300
they're all dead because of me.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.300
I arranged everything.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.500
I set the timetable,

25:32.600 --> 25:35.700
I paid off the killers,

25:36.400 --> 25:39.100
I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.

25:42.500 --> 25:46.000
Today wasn't the first time
I tried to have you killed,jack.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.900
Why?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.700
Because I love my country!

25:53.700 --> 25:55.300
And in the real world,

25:55.400 --> 25:58.400
sometimes that means you have
to do things,terrible things...

25:58.500 --> 26:02.300
even unforgivable things,
for the sake of your country.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.500
But you know all about that,don't you,brother?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.500
We're the same.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.900
I mean,look at me.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.400
We're the same!

26:13.400 --> 26:16.000
We are not the same!

26:16.600 --> 26:17.400
You want me to kill you?!

26:17.500 --> 26:18.000
Do it!

26:18.100 --> 26:19.500
I'm gonna do it my way!

26:19.600 --> 26:20.400
Four more cc'S.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.200
I can't do that.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.700
Pick up the syringe!

26:22.800 --> 26:23.700
Do it!

26:23.800 --> 26:24.800
Now!

26:26.300 --> 26:27.200
Son of a bitch!

26:27.300 --> 26:29.100
-******** -Get me somebody in here now.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.400
You want to die?

26:30.900 --> 26:32.200
Drop your weapon!

26:32.300 --> 26:33.600
Drop it!

26:35.500 --> 26:36.800
You're gonna die.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.600
Shut down the iv.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.700
Shut it down.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.300
I'm here,baby.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.600
I'm ashamed.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.600
What do you mean you're ashamed?

27:46.700 --> 27:48.500
For spying on those men.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.500
I thought I was doing the right thing.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.400
I was wrong.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.000
You did the only thing that you could do...

27:58.600 --> 28:00.900
okay,and that was the right thing.

28:06.100 --> 28:10.600
you're the bravest,most principled
man I've ever known.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.800
you get some rest,okay?

28:33.500 --> 28:34.300
hello?

28:34.700 --> 28:35.600
Sandra?

28:36.300 --> 28:37.300
It's wayne.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.400
I just heard what happened to walid.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.200
I am so sorry.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.700
Is he going to be all right?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
Yeah,I think so.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.200
What they told me is confusing.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.600
They said walid was working undercover
to expose some plot.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.500
There was no plot.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.900
The men weren't part of any conspiracy.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.800
They were just bystanders.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.900
They tell me these men had information
about the nuclear weapons.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.500
One of the men pulled it from the internet
and showed it to his friends.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.000
Sandra,they should've reported that.

29:08.300 --> 29:12.100
They were afraid they were going to get into
more trouble than they're already in.

29:12.700 --> 29:18.500
Most of these men were pulled from their jobs and
their homes on trumped-up immigration charges.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.800
And now they're facing deportation.

29:20.900 --> 29:26.600
Wayne,you are detaining without due process
the people whose help you need the most.

29:27.100 --> 29:31.100
How do you expect for them to help
if they don't have any legal protection?

29:32.000 --> 29:32.800
Wayne...

29:34.300 --> 29:35.700
I'm scared.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.100
I know.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.600
Everything's gonna be all right.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.700
What's the status?

29:47.100 --> 29:47.800
Program's finished.

29:47.900 --> 29:49.400
I just ran it,but this is all we got.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.300
I still don't have a clear image.

29:51.800 --> 29:52.400
what are you doing?

29:52.500 --> 29:55.500
I'm downloading an unlicensed
application from a hacker's site.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.100
It might kick-start things.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.600
Or it could corrupt the file.

29:58.700 --> 29:59.900
I know these guys.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.200
They write really good code when
they're not serving time.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.300
Unbelievable.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.100
That's what graem was holding back?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.900
Not only was he responsible for
david palmer's assassination,

30:10.000 --> 30:11.600
but he directed the entire conspiracy.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.400
He was trying to protect the company.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.300
That's what he's trying to do now.

30:15.700 --> 30:16.700
Incredible.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.100
I wish it got us closer to
the nukes,but it doesn'T.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.700
He doesn't know where mccarthy is.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.900
Were you able to pick up anything on nsa chatter?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.400
We think it may contain an
image of mccarthy's engineer.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.600
How long till you know for sure?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.400
Can't say.The file's badly corrupted.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.800
Morris is working on it now.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.200
As soon as my brother's ready for transport,

30:31.300 --> 30:33.400
I want him sent back to ctu
for further debriefing.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.400
I've redirected a chopper to jackson
middle school,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.200
four miles west of your position.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.400
Thanks,bill.

31:16.500 --> 31:21.000
Dad,graem made his own choices after
you let him start running the company.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.200
You can't make yourself responsible for that.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.600
That's not fair.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.500
I'll tell you what isn't fair.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.500
You deserved a better family,jack.

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
Not this.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.700
Not us.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.100
I can just imagine what you must be feeling.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.800
All that time we lost...

31:52.900 --> 31:55.200
what I wouldn't give to have some of it back.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.500
Me,too.

32:04.300 --> 32:04.800
Agent bauer.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.300
Yeah.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.200
Your brother's been stabilized.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.100
He'll be ready to move in ten minutes.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.100
Thank you.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.600
Dad,i want you to go back to ctu.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.400
Okay.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.000
I need a few minutes.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.500
Of coursE.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.600
They're sending a chopper for me.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.300
I have to go.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.050
there.

33:09.050 --> 33:09.850
What?

33:10.250 --> 33:11.850
The plug-in's working.

33:11.850 --> 33:13.250
How long's it going to take?

33:13.250 --> 33:13.950
It's restoring.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.750
You'll have a photo of the
engineer in two minutes.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.850
Just don't touch anything.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.250
Now I have got to go and find out
what's happening with my brother.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.650
Save it,milo.

33:21.650 --> 33:23.050
Thanks for trying to help.

33:25.250 --> 33:25.950
I'm leaving.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.150
Watch my station,okay?

33:27.150 --> 33:27.650
Be careful.

33:27.650 --> 33:29.050
Call me when you find anything out about timothy.

33:29.150 --> 33:30.250
I will.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.150
Congratulations,tom.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.850
It's an excellent plan.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.550
Well,thank you very much,mr.Vice president.

33:42.650 --> 33:45.850
It's about time someone in this administration
stood up to these people.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.050
To be honest,

33:49.750 --> 33:52.750
I didn't think this president had
the stomach for the cure.

33:53.550 --> 33:55.850
I think we're about ready for kickoff here,sir.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.550
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

34:01.950 --> 34:03.050
Is the vice president with us?

34:03.150 --> 34:04.750
I'm on the plane,sir.

34:05.450 --> 34:08.949
I'm assuming everyone here has
read executive order 1066?

34:09.650 --> 34:14.750
Tom first proposed his plan to me very
early this morning,and I rejected it.

34:14.850 --> 34:20.150
Sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed
by the constitution seemed like,

34:21.050 --> 34:24.650
like too steep a price,
even for the promise of securitY.

34:25.050 --> 34:31.550
But then fayed murdered 12,000
innocent americans with a nuclear weapon.

34:31.850 --> 34:35.150
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.949
After careful reconsideration,

34:41.150 --> 34:45.350
I remain convinced that my initial
response was in fact the right one.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.850
That implementing this plan--

34:48.150 --> 34:49.949
would be a terrible mistake.

34:50.250 --> 34:54.750
I cannot and I will not endorse these actions.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.850
Some of you actually seem to feel

34:59.950 --> 35:04.850
that the constitution is somehow
valid only during times of peace,

35:04.950 --> 35:06.950
but not during wartime.

35:07.450 --> 35:10.050
That is not what the founders intended.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.950
With your indulgence,sir,

35:12.050 --> 35:17.350
george washington's enemies wore bright
red coats and marched in a straight line.

35:17.450 --> 35:21.150
The founders could have never
conceived of a stateless enemy,

35:21.250 --> 35:24.650
hiding among us,that targets not our soldiers,

35:24.750 --> 35:26.150
but our civilization.

35:26.250 --> 35:30.250
Your plan would only hinder the efforts
of law enforcement to stop fayed.

35:30.350 --> 35:33.750
How does my plan hinder law enforcement,sir?

35:33.850 --> 35:40.250
By marginalizing and thereby radicalizing the
very people whose help they need to enlist.

35:41.050 --> 35:46.350
The american muslim community is our best
line of defense against these terrorists.

35:48.150 --> 35:55.850
But we americans need to demonstrate that
we are governed by the rule of law and never,

35:56.750 --> 35:59.150
never by the politics of fear.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.150
Mr.President.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.750
Yes,noah?

36:03.050 --> 36:05.250
Before you make any unilateral decisions,

36:05.350 --> 36:08.550
maybe you should hear some
other people's thoughts.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.950
I'm sorry,noah.

36:10.150 --> 36:12.250
The discussion on this matter...

36:13.950 --> 36:14.950
is over.

36:19.150 --> 36:20.150
This better work.

36:20.350 --> 36:21.650
Jack's on his way back to ctu.

36:21.750 --> 36:24.650
I want holding "a" and "b" prepped
for interrogation

36:24.750 --> 36:27.050
and put together a clearance package
for him,no restrictions.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.150
Yes,sir.

36:29.150 --> 36:30.150
We have it yet?

36:30.450 --> 36:32.050
It's gonna be a few more seconds.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.550
As soon as we I.D.The engineer,

36:33.650 --> 36:35.250
I want it posted on the interagency subnet.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.150
We need all eyes possible on this.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.250
Yes,sir.

36:38.950 --> 36:40.150
Oh,my god!

36:40.250 --> 36:41.350
It's morris!

36:41.650 --> 36:43.950
It's his cv,personal history,everything.

36:44.050 --> 36:44.950
Where is he?

36:44.950 --> 36:46.650
On his way to horizon regional hospital.

36:46.750 --> 36:47.250
We got to call that.

36:47.350 --> 36:48.550
His brother was hurt in the blast.

36:48.650 --> 36:49.850
He just left.

36:52.350 --> 36:52.850
Security.

36:52.850 --> 36:53.550
This is bill bhanan.

36:53.650 --> 36:56.150
Has morris o'brian left the parking lot?

36:56.250 --> 36:57.650
He just drove out,sir.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.450
Damn it!

36:59.950 --> 37:01.550
Milo,contact lapd.

37:01.650 --> 37:02.950
Put an apb out on his car.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.850
Chloe,see if you can raise him on his cell phone.

37:08.650 --> 37:09.250
Bauer.

37:09.350 --> 37:10.950
Jack,we just id'ed the engineer.

37:11.050 --> 37:12.350
It's morris o'brian.

37:12.350 --> 37:13.050
Morris?

37:13.150 --> 37:13.850
Yes.

37:13.950 --> 37:17.050
The file we intercepted was morris's photo and cv.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.750
Mccarthy was sending it to fayed.

37:18.850 --> 37:20.950
There is no doubt morris is the engineer.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.150
Fine.Put him under a protective watch.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.050
We can'T.

37:23.150 --> 37:24.050
He's gone.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.450
He got a call claiming his brother
was in the hospital.

37:26.550 --> 37:27.550
He just left.

37:27.650 --> 37:28.750
We're trying to raise him on his cell.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.050
Morris,hold on.

37:30.550 --> 37:31.150
He's on line one.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.050
We got him,jack.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.150
Patch me through.

37:33.750 --> 37:34.950
Morris,it's bill buchanan.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.250
We're on the line with jack bauer.

37:36.350 --> 37:36.850
Where are you?

37:36.950 --> 37:38.450
I'm on my way to the hospital.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.450
You need to come back to ctu immediately.

37:40.550 --> 37:41.550
I can't do that.

37:41.650 --> 37:42.550
Morris,this is jack.

37:42.650 --> 37:43.150
Listen to me.

37:43.150 --> 37:44.350
There is nothing wrong with your brother.

37:44.450 --> 37:45.350
It's a setup.

37:45.450 --> 37:47.750
The engineer mccarthy's looking for,it's you.

37:48.350 --> 37:48.850
Me?

37:48.950 --> 37:51.350
It was your photo mccarthy was sending to fayed.

37:51.450 --> 37:53.150
Morris,you need to turn the car around now.

37:53.250 --> 37:54.850
Okay,okay.

37:59.350 --> 38:00.550
Morris!

38:02.550 --> 38:03.850
Get out of the car or the next one's in your head!

38:03.950 --> 38:04.650
What the bloody hell do you want?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.050
Don't talk,move!

38:06.150 --> 38:07.450
Come on.Let's go.

38:08.050 --> 38:08.750
Jack,they got him!

38:08.850 --> 38:10.850
It sounds like they're transferring
him to another vehicle.

38:10.950 --> 38:14.250
Chloe,bring up a satellite feed
five-mile radius of ctu.

38:14.350 --> 38:15.850
Hurry.

38:22.450 --> 38:23.450
Drive.

38:32.750 --> 38:33.750
yes?

38:33.750 --> 38:34.850
We're on our way.

38:34.850 --> 38:36.050
How soon can you be here?

38:36.150 --> 38:37.350
15 minutes.

38:37.450 --> 38:38.550
We'll be waiting.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.950
With my money.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.150
You'll get paid as soon as I have what I want.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.550
Let me be clear.

38:44.150 --> 38:45.150
I'm just delivering him.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.450
You'll have to make him cooperate.

38:47.550 --> 38:48.650
He'll cooperate.

39:21.950 --> 39:22.650
Agent burke,

39:23.850 --> 39:25.450
I'd like to speak to my son.

39:26.450 --> 39:27.350
All right.

39:27.950 --> 39:28.950
Five minutes.

39:29.550 --> 39:30.450
Thanks.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.450
How am I doing?

39:50.150 --> 39:51.250
You're doing great.

39:53.550 --> 39:56.350
Everyone thinks jack is so tough.

39:56.650 --> 39:58.050
Maybe he is...

39:58.550 --> 39:59.850
but so am I.

40:01.950 --> 40:06.050
It's nice to know that I can take
anything he can dish out.

40:07.850 --> 40:09.250
You told him about palmer.

40:09.350 --> 40:11.250
I had to give him something to
make him think I cracked,

40:11.350 --> 40:12.850
but I kept you out of it.

40:14.850 --> 40:16.450
It's gonna get a lot worse.

40:17.050 --> 40:18.350
He's not finished.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.350
He knows you didn't tell him everything.

40:20.450 --> 40:22.650
And I won'T.You know I won't,dad.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.550
They're going to take you to ctu.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.050
They'll do things there that'll make
this seem like a cakewalk.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.250
Well,like i said,

40:33.350 --> 40:34.650
I can take it.

40:36.050 --> 40:37.450
I'd like to believe that.

40:38.850 --> 40:40.950
The problem is,I have to be sure.

40:41.850 --> 40:43.150
Well,you can be.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.750
I'll hold my mud,dad.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.150
Everything's going exactly according to plan.

40:49.250 --> 40:50.650
Jack bought the ruse.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.550
Oh,I know.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.950
I'm sure we convinced him that you were
going to have me killed as well.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.050
Yeah,

40:57.150 --> 40:59.650
that makes me the bad guy and you the good guy.

40:59.750 --> 41:02.150
I take the rap,do some time,you skate free.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.350
Get me out when you can.

41:03.450 --> 41:05.950
Meanwhile,the company lives on.

41:07.150 --> 41:08.750
Dad,stick to the plan.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.250
That's what you've always said,right?

41:11.350 --> 41:11.850
Make a plan.

41:11.950 --> 41:13.150
Stick to it.

41:15.350 --> 41:17.250
Sometimes you have to make adjustments.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.450
I would never betray you,dad.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.150
I love you.

41:27.350 --> 41:28.850
I love you,too,graem.

41:30.450 --> 41:31.750
You've been a good boy.

41:33.050 --> 41:34.650
Done everything I asked.

41:35.750 --> 41:39.450
Only this time,I asked too much.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.050
Sorry.

41:46.150 --> 41:47.050
Dad...

42:29.450 --> 42:31.050
my son's had a seizure!

42:31.150 --> 42:31.850
Get in here now!

42:31.950 --> 42:32.950
Hurry up!

42:34.350 --> 42:35.350
What happened?

42:35.850 --> 42:36.550
Is he going to make it?

42:36.650 --> 42:38.750
I don't know. Please,give us the
room so we can work.

42:38.850 --> 42:40.550
Get ctu medical now!

42:41.650 --> 42:42.950
My god,

42:43.050 --> 42:46.750
if you people killed my son,I swear...

42:47.850 --> 42:50.750
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
