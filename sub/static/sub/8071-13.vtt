OK, OK, now, I left two
bottles in the fridge.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.281
I know, and we heat 'em first.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.582
Uh-huh.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.684
And don't heat 'em up in the
microwave, because I heard

00:16.784 --> 00:18.252
it's dangerous for the baby.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.255
Only if the baby's
still hanging onto it.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.191
And-- and be careful
of his soft spot.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.625
He's got a soft spot right here.

00:24.725 --> 00:25.659
Yeah.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.561
Yeah, so, we better
not find anything

00:27.661 --> 00:29.029
stuck in that head
that's not supposed

00:29.130 --> 00:31.332
to be there when we get back.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.333
Don't worry.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.267
Oh, yes.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.669
Yes, sweetie.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.405
Darlene, you help
your sister out.

OK, I feed.

You wife.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.480
You call if you
have any questions.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.381
OK.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.349
OK, bye, honey.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.983
We will be gone too long.

Everything is
gonna be all right.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.753
Come on, Crystal.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.522
Don't you think it's time
you cut the cord already?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.657
Well, it's important to talk
to your children, Roseanne.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.791
They are people, you know.

Oh, man, are you sure we're
old enough to get in here?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.818
Yeah, this looks like where
people go when they can't

01:57.918 --> 01:59.920
play shuffleboard no more.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.088
Now, you just wait.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.198
You're messing with us, right?

02:10.298 --> 02:13.033
They got naked male
strippers behind the door?

02:14.402 --> 02:15.769
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.206
Let's go to town.
- Thank you.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.474
Maybe they got cake.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.376
It so happens I
know a woman who

02:22.476 --> 02:24.712
won $75 here the other night.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.946
Oh, really?

02:26.046 --> 02:28.416
Well, did she retire or
keep going to work every day

02:28.516 --> 02:30.418
just like nothing happened?

02:30.518 --> 02:34.388

02:42.863 --> 02:43.664
You're kidding me?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.833
12 bucks, what a racket.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.569
Roseanne, please,

03:08.088 --> 03:09.490
My area.
Don't you see?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.458
I'm all set up here.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.737
Sorry.

Ah!

You know, I think I'm
starting to miss my husband.

let Crystal pick what we

Well, change his diaper again.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.607
I just changed it.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.141
Well, maybe you did it wrong.

05:41.241 --> 05:45.245
(BABY VOICE) Maybe you gave
him a little baby wedgie.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.648
That's not it.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.650
Does his color
look right to you?

05:49.750 --> 05:50.651
I don't know.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.290
What are you doing?

05:57.391 --> 05:58.426

05:58.526 --> 06:03.063
Well, does this calm
you down, you moron?

Well, gee, I'm sorry, Becky.

And he can't be
hungry, 'cause I

06:24.084 --> 06:25.853
eat him like every 15 minutes.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.889
Well, now you know why you
had to change him so much.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.123
I mean, I'm not sure.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.324
I mean, he might
be a little warm.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.160
Do you think we should
take him to the hospital?

waffles in the freezer.

Crystal's list didn't say
anything about frozen waffles.

Well, she's my ride.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.973
Why would she leave me?

10:06.073 --> 10:09.542
Maybe that's just her
little way of ditching you.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.211
Oh, great, now I've
gotta quit and go

10:11.311 --> 10:12.980
find out what the hell's
the matter with her.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.581
Which one of you's is
gonna give me a ride?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.016
- You take her.
- I don't want to take her.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.917
Well, me neither.

10:17.017 --> 10:17.985
Well, she's on your way.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.086
She won $50.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.055
She can take a cab.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.524
Hey, one of you
is taking me home.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.525
I ain't taking you.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.426
Ha, ha, ha.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.933
[knocking]

10:34.001 --> 10:36.069
Hey, Crystal.

10:36.169 --> 10:36.970
Where's Roseanne?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.772
Still at Bingo.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.240
Oh, hi, little Ed.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.675
Did you miss me, honey?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.010
Did you eat?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.478
Did you take a little nap?

10:45.578 --> 10:46.980
Good to see he isn't
talking to you either.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.982
I thought he was snubbing me.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.784
Where's Becky and Darlene?

10:50.884 --> 10:52.552
I'm supposed to pay them.
- Well, pay DJ.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.453
He fed little Ed.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.554
He played with him.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.489
He even gave him his old bear.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.726
Well. that's wonderful, DJ.

10:58.826 --> 11:02.629
Well, here's $5 for being
such a responsible young man.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.931
Aw, right!

11:04.031 --> 11:05.532
Yeah, go show your sisters.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.638
Make sure you rub
that in real good.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.576
How come you didn't bring
Roseanne home with you?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.477
I left early.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.846
How she gonna get home?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.480
I don't care.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.716
Don't tell me you
two had a fight.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.151
OK, Dan, I won't.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.485
That way you don't
have to know anything

11:25.585 --> 11:27.154
so you don't have to do
anything about it, just

11:27.254 --> 11:28.055
like your father.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.626
So was it tequila night
down at St. Benedict's?

11:38.766 --> 11:40.167
Why'd you leave me down there?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.902
Well, you were in
your glory, Roseanne.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.036
I didn't want to interrupt.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.637
Oh, cut the crap, Crystal.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.839
So what's your problem?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.240
Forget it.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.742
Geez, I was having a
great time down there,

11:48.842 --> 11:51.078
and I left the Bingo hall, and--
- Oh, and how about that?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.880
And I thought playing
Bingo was just another one

11:52.980 --> 11:55.248
of Crystal's stupid ideas.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.886
Well, after I won 50
bucks it got funner.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.620
50 bucks, Roseanne?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.023
So are you gonna retire or
are you gonna go to your job

12:03.123 --> 12:05.025
tomorrow like nothing happened?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.894
I was just teasy, geez!

12:06.994 --> 12:08.261
That's the way we are.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.798
It's the way you
are, always have been.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.901
Ever since high school,
everything I do is stupid.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.869
Everything I say is stupid.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.471
Even the way I raise
my kids is stupid.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.008
Oh, you're way over
exaggerating now.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.142
Oh, yeah, you're right.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.710
When you're not telling
me how stupid I am,

12:23.811 --> 12:25.779
you're criticizing me
or making fun of me.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.981
And when you're not doing
that, you're just ignoring me.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.649
I do not ignore you.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.251
How long did it take
before you'd realized

12:31.351 --> 12:34.554
that I'd left the Bingo parlor?

12:34.654 --> 12:36.056
OK.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.490
All right.
I'm sorry.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.391
OK?

12:38.491 --> 12:39.960
No, fine.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.661
One I'm sorry, and
that's supposed

12:41.761 --> 12:45.232
to make up for 20 years.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.800
What was that?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.635
Crystal's mad.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.770
I've never seen
her like that, ever.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.739
She even yelled at me,
and I was being adorable.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.909
You really must've done
something to tick her off.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.978
I swear, I didn't do anything.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.280
Come on, Roseanne,
what'd you do?

13:00.380 --> 13:03.884
Dan, I did not treat her any
different than I always do.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.419
Well, you better
go apologize then.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.256
Well, hey, if she had some
complaint against the way

13:09.356 --> 13:10.690
I've been treating her
for all these years,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.459
then how come she waits
till now to say something,

13:12.559 --> 13:13.460
you know what I mean?

13:13.560 --> 13:14.461
How come she never
came to me before?

13:14.561 --> 13:15.362
I'm easy to talk to.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.263
I listen.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.269
OK, I'll call her
tomorrow and apologize.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.770
Atta girl.

13:23.871 --> 13:24.872
How was Bingo?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.339
Oh man, it was incredible.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.574
It was such a rush.
- Yeah?

13:27.674 --> 13:28.475
Yeah.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.377
Did you win?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.444
Uh, no.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.319
JACKIE: Well, if Crystal's
returning your calls,

13:39.419 --> 13:40.787
then you should go see her.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.422
No, why should I?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.390
Hey, Louise.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.058
Because you're upset.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.193
No, I'm not upset.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.861
She's the one that's upset.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.997
You know, I've been a very
good friend to Crystal.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.364
You know, ever since
the eighth grade,

13:51.464 --> 13:53.766
I've been with her
through four husbands.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.667
Hey, Peg.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.137
PEG: Yo, Ro.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.671
You know, and when she
decided she's getting

13:58.771 --> 13:59.873
married to Dan's dad, I--

13:59.973 --> 14:02.075
I put the entire wedding
together, did I not?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.044
Huh?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.179
Hey, Lloyd.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.414
How do you know these people?

14:07.514 --> 14:08.781
Oh, you know, I've
been kind of playing

14:08.882 --> 14:10.050
the church circuit here.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.784
But this here's
the best game here.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.487
It's got the big pots, you
know, and the numbers come fast.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.890
You stick close to me, 'cause
things could get harry.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.525
Harry?

14:18.625 --> 14:22.729
This is the game where you put
the bean on the card, right?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.431
Hey.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.666
Arnie, what are
you doing here?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.435
I'm gonna be the caller.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.237
Huh, you're kidding me?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.205
No, no, see there's lot of
money in this Bingo thing,

14:32.305 --> 14:33.440
right?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.674
But the problem is, all the
callers are like boring.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.276
So I'm gonna make it
fun, and then people

14:36.376 --> 14:37.810
are gonna start requesting me.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.479
And then I'm gonna become
like a celebrity, right?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.314
And then I'll become
Mr. Bingo, and then

14:41.414 --> 14:42.950
open up my own Indian
reservation to make

14:43.050 --> 14:45.318
a hell of a lot of money.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.654
What do you think about that?

14:47.754 --> 14:50.790
Well, let's start with
you're not an Indian.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.192
I'll convert.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.460
Mr. Thomas, I just
want to thank you

14:53.560 --> 14:54.827
for volunteering to do this.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.596
Anything I can do for
the community, Padre.

14:56.696 --> 14:57.730
Listen, I've got a problem.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.699
I saw the sign outside,
and it only says Bingo.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.970
How are people
gonna know I'm here?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.604
That man saw you naked.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.538
Shut up.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.946
You think you spent enough
money on Bingo cards?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.949
I did not come to lose.

15:16.049 --> 15:20.053
You are getting very
weird here, Roseanne.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.222
I am not.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.324
What's with all the lighters?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.726
They're just sort
of, you know, for luck.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.861
Oh, you're kidding me!

15:28.962 --> 15:30.863
No, everybody does it.

15:30.964 --> 15:31.798
You know, it's just for fun.

15:31.898 --> 15:32.932
It doesn't mean nothing.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.234
It's not like I need
them or anything.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.404
You-- you can take
one if you want.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.606
Not the yellow one!

15:39.706 --> 15:41.008
ARNIE: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:41.108 --> 15:44.044
and welcome to Bingo night here
at the fabulous St. Benny's.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.046
I'm your host and caller for
the evening, Arnie Thomas,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.314
reminding you that
even though you're

15:47.414 --> 15:49.949
in the presence of the Savior,
do not save your money,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.351
because it all goes to charity.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.452
But seriously, folks--

15:52.552 --> 15:53.753
Just call the numbers!

15:56.389 --> 15:59.159
Coming right up.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.360
But before I call
out this number,

16:00.460 --> 16:01.894
are there any honeymooners
in the crowd tonight?

16:01.995 --> 16:02.996
[collective booing]

16:03.096 --> 16:04.797
You know, being here
at Bingo does remind

16:04.897 --> 16:05.698
me of a very funny story.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.034
PARTICIPANT: Let's go!

16:07.134 --> 16:08.835
OK, all right.

16:08.935 --> 16:09.836
OK.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.338
I-27!

16:11.438 --> 16:12.505
I-27!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.241
Just kidding, it's
actually I-17.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.908
That's a little bit of
Bingo humor from Arnie.

16:16.009 --> 16:16.876
You know, folks--

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
[collective booing]

16:18.911 --> 16:19.746
I work in the room!

16:19.846 --> 16:20.647
I work in the room!

16:20.747 --> 16:21.748
Excuse me.

16:21.848 --> 16:25.952
I have seen you like
this before, Roseanne.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.887
You're addicted.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.788
Oh, please!

16:28.888 --> 16:30.357
No, I'm serious.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.060
You've spent the last
like five nights at Bingo.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.061
So?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.063
So, when you
started smoking again,

16:36.163 --> 16:38.098
you were up to two
packs a day in a week.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.466
Now you're spending
all your time here.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.700
It's the same thing.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.634
Oh, get out of here.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.535
It is not.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.271
It's just about having fun, OK?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.439
You're hooked, admit it.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.907
Bingo is fun.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.277
No, it's not.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.179
ARNIE: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.051
OK, that was fun.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.326
[knocking]

17:06.426 --> 17:07.327
Come in.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.564
Hey.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.532
Hello, Roseanne.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.741
(BABY TALK) Hi, little Ed.
Hello.

17:21.841 --> 17:25.345
Looky what you left over
at my house the other day.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.279
Oh.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.181
That's real nice
of you, Roseanne.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.883
Thanks for dropping that by.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.787
Well, you know, I just--

17:34.887 --> 17:36.189
I-- I-- I just--

17:36.289 --> 17:38.825
I didn't want it to look like
I just came over to apologize,

17:38.925 --> 17:40.693
you know?

17:40.793 --> 17:43.496
I mean, I-- I kind of
brought your blender back,

17:43.596 --> 17:45.998
but it's broken.

17:46.099 --> 17:51.171
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't
call you back all this time.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.241
Yeah, well, let's not do
this anymore, OK, Crystal?

17:54.341 --> 17:56.409
We've been friends for too long.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.378
Yes, we have.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.913
OK, and I was thinking about
what you said and everything.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.849
And you're right, I do
make fun of you too much,

18:02.949 --> 18:04.284
so I'm not gonna do it any more.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.185
Promise.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.819
Of course you will.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.257
No, I'm not going
to, I promise.

18:10.357 --> 18:15.195
Roseanne, I'm pregnant again.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.131
[sighs] Is this a test?

18:23.503 --> 18:24.604
Oh, wow.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.005
Yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.007
Oh, wow.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.642
That's why I got
so crazy on you.

18:29.742 --> 18:34.080
My hormones sort of have
a mouth of their own.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.216
Well, why didn't you tell me?

18:36.316 --> 18:39.719
Because you were
being a big stupid jerk.

18:39.819 --> 18:43.590
I guess that's your
hormones talking again, huh?

18:43.690 --> 18:44.791
I can't believe it, Roseanne.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.493
We were using birth control.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.629
And-- and I wasn't getting
my time of the month

18:49.729 --> 18:51.030
since I've been nursing and all.

18:51.130 --> 18:55.235
And all of a sudden, I started
getting symptoms, and--

18:55.335 --> 18:58.271
why'd this happen
to me, Roseanne?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.772
Oh, Crystal.

18:59.872 --> 19:05.245
I got a nine-month-old baby,
and a husband who's never home,

19:05.345 --> 19:08.781
and a teenage son who's real
hard to love a lot of the time.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.385
And, ha, look at this place.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.488
How am I gonna deal
with another baby?

19:15.588 --> 19:19.426
Well, maybe this one will
be the girl you always wanted.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.594
Maybe.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.097
I just wish Ed was around
to help a little more.

19:25.198 --> 19:29.302
Yeah, I think
Ed's done enough.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.239
You know me and Dan are
here for you, Crystal.

19:32.339 --> 19:36.343
And so is Becky, and so is
Darlene, even though they

19:36.443 --> 19:37.577
don't kind of know it yet.

19:37.677 --> 19:41.314
But, I mean, even DJ
can help out, you know?

19:41.414 --> 19:43.383
Everything will
be fine, Crystal.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.652
You'll see.

19:45.752 --> 19:46.553
Thank you, Roseanne.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.425
Oh.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.693
Want some decaf?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.162
Yeah, that'd be great.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.465
(BABY TALK) Oh little
Ed, you're set up.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.668
You know, I did finally try
to call you back last night.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.504
Oh, yeah, I was
out playing Bingo.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.538
Again?

20:05.638 --> 20:06.973
Yeah.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.409
I've been playing it most
every night, you know.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.078
But this Saturday that's a
big game, and then that's

20:12.178 --> 20:12.979
it for me.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.582
I'm quitting on Sunday.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.885
Monday for sure.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.788
[theme music]

20:23.790 --> 20:28.561
(SINGING) Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.462
Up come the sun--

20:29.562 --> 20:30.397
Hey.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.464
Yo.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.432
Where's Roseanne?

20:32.532 --> 20:35.468
One guess.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.903
Oh god, you're kidding?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.438
We were supposed
to go to a movie.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.739
It was the weirdest thing.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.508
We're sitting there
watching television,

20:41.608 --> 20:43.876
and this commercial
for the cereal came on.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.212
And the guy started talking
about all the vitamins it had.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.549
He started talking
about B1, B6, B12.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.651
I turned around,
and she was gone.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.657
Dan, we have a problem.

20:57.757 --> 21:02.929
People who get addicted to this
type of stuff, they change.

21:03.029 --> 21:07.334
They become completely
different people.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.234
PRIEST: I-18.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.472
I-18.

21:22.382 --> 21:27.253
N-38, N-38, that's all I
need, one more number, N-38.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.154
PRIEST: N-31.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.326
Oh!

21:33.426 --> 21:34.594
[banging]
- Grab her!

21:34.694 --> 21:35.728
Ahh!

21:35.828 --> 21:37.897
Hold her, hug her, tell
her that you love her.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.399
This is for your
own good, Roseanne.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.299
It's OK, folks.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.200
They called my number!

21:41.300 --> 21:43.069
Sorry, folks.
