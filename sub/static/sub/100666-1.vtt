12:12.898 --> 12:14.608
Well, not physically, at least.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.569
Gotta be strong mentally,

12:16.902 --> 12:17.903
and emotionally.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.114
Trust me, that's what matters.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.324
Mom says that all the time.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.702
Or she did. At least, when she was here.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.081
Listen, your mom was right.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.544
And just because she's not here
does not mean that she doesn't love you.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.755
Never forget that, all right?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
Give me some.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.011
And hey, Big E! You never forget
that Grandma is here,

12:42.094 --> 12:44.764
willing and ready
and waiting for you, baby.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.265
You are so fine!

12:46.348 --> 12:47.725
Grandma, seriously, please.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.101
What? He's cute.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.978
Hey, you guys. Sorry I'm late.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
The garage was a mess today.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.609
Denise.

12:57.735 --> 12:58.819
Stephen.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.238
Oh, look, Dad. It's the best part.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.450
Oh, yeah. This is where Big E
makes his pecs bounce.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.369
Up and down, up and down.
Oh, my God, it drives me wild.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.371
Go, Big E! Whoo! Yes!

13:09.455 --> 13:12.374
For the record, we have different opinions
on what the best part is.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.296
Dad, remember when you said
every wrestler has a weakness?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.590
I guess I did say that, yeah.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.427
Well, I think Jimmy Usos' is his temper.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.597
[Leo] Oh! See? Look!

13:26.680 --> 13:29.433
He ran straight into Kofi.
He wasn't thinking straight.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.852
-Yeah, that is very cool, man.
-[laughs]

13:31.936 --> 13:32.812
Very cool.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.480
[bell ringing on TV]

13:34.563 --> 13:37.233
Ooh. Look. They're about to make
a big announcement.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.152
<i>WWE Universe, I'm the A-Lister.</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:43.572
<i>The most must-see</i>
<i>WWE Superstar in history, The Miz,</i>

13:43.656 --> 13:45.699
<i>and the time has finally come.</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:50.746
<i>You have a once-in-a-lifetime chance</i>
<i>to become the next NXT Superstar.</i>

13:50.830 --> 13:52.206
<i>So if you think you have what it takes,</i>

13:52.289 --> 13:53.874
<i>get your butt down to Fallbridge.</i>

13:53.958 --> 13:56.377
Uh... I'm sorry, hang on. Fallbridge?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.753
<i>Yes, Fallbridge.</i>

13:57.837 --> 13:58.712
Fallbridge?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.130
<i>That's right. Fallbridge.</i>

14:00.214 --> 14:03.050
<i>The WWE is hosting</i>
<i>a winner-take-all tournament,</i>

14:03.133 --> 14:05.594
<i>where two finalists will square off</i>
<i>inside a steel cage.</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:08.597
<i>The winner will receive</i>
<i>not only an NXT contract,</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:10.933
<i>but a $50,000 cash prize.</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:12.685
<i>So don't Miz out</i>

14:12.768 --> 14:16.272
<i>on this </i> awesome <i>opportunity.</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:19.108
The WWE is coming right here
to Fallbridge?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.277
-What? Yeah, baby!
-Yeah!

14:21.360 --> 14:23.362
Whoo! [laughs] 

14:23.821 --> 14:24.738
Hey...

14:25.614 --> 14:26.949
Where is my bread?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.243
It was stale. I threw it out.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.453
Oh! Becky Lynch. Yes!

14:31.537 --> 14:32.830
[Denise grunts] 

14:32.913 --> 14:36.917
Dad, remember that time we went to <i>Raw,</i>
and Mom met Becky Lynch after the show?

14:37.334 --> 14:39.295
Yes, I do remember that.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.255
That was a very fun time for your mother.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.631
You know what? It's fine.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.217
I have like two or three
emergency sandwiches

14:45.301 --> 14:46.927
hidden in the kitchen somewhere.

14:47.052 --> 14:51.348
[announcer] <i>It's a major tag-team match,</i>
<i>and it's up next live on </i> Monday Night Raw.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.394
[Denise] You can't keep doing that.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.565
You change the topic every time
he brings up his mother,

14:59.648 --> 15:02.401
or run out to the garage
and work on that car.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.280
Well, what happened with Rachel
is a sensitive subject,

15:06.947 --> 15:09.241
and I'm just not quite sure
how to broach it.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.619
[Denise] How would you know that?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.579
You avoid talking to him.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.500
[Steve] To my credit,
I only avoid talking to him

15:18.584 --> 15:20.169
about his mother leaving him.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.632
[Denise] Steve, Rachel leaving
was a surprise to all of us.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.009
-[Steve groans]
-[Denise] You gotta unpack this.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.638
[Steve] Can we talk about anything else?
Please?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.724
I mean, there are 1,000 things
that I would rather do,

15:33.807 --> 15:36.644
than talk about my wife leaving me
for someone else,

15:36.727 --> 15:38.228
with her mother.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.273
You know, it may not mean much,
but I, um...

15:41.607 --> 15:45.361
adjusted my schedule
just to take a few weeks off

15:45.444 --> 15:48.238
to come here and try
to help <i>you </i> through this.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.865
And I appreciate that.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.077
Look, as soon as I can pay down the bank,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.120
I will stop driving Lyft.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.830
I will go from two jobs to one job,

15:56.914 --> 15:59.166
and I will find
some semblance of normalcy.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.751
Whatever that looks like now.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.837
But I still owe the bank like $20,000.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.756
If I don't pay it soon, I...

16:06.757 --> 16:08.050
I might lose the house.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.761
[Denise] I told you. I'll take out
a second mortgage on the store.

16:10.844 --> 16:14.056
[Steve] No. Come on, I can't.
This is my mess. I'll clean it up.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.283
What the...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.537
Ugh. It's getting worse.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.255
Huh.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.048
[sniffs]

16:48.424 --> 16:49.466
[groans]

16:51.427 --> 16:52.761
[exhales]

16:54.221 --> 16:55.347
[inhales deeply] 

17:00.019 --> 17:01.979
[deeper voice] Ooh. Fits perfect.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.983
Although, it's almost a crime
to hide this studly face from the world.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.151
Sorry, ladies.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.946
[regular voice] What was that?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.746
[deep-voiced]
That was just you being you, big man.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.457
You're a limousine-riding,
jet-flying cool dude

17:21.540 --> 17:23.625
with a larger-than-life personality.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.836
[regular voice] I wet the bed
until I was eight.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.588
[deep-voiced]
I wet the bed until I was eight.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.924
[regular voice] Why did that
sound so much cooler?

17:31.008 --> 17:33.135
[deep-voiced]
Are you ready to face the man of the hour?

17:33.218 --> 17:38.515
The man with the power,
the guy who's too sweet to be sour? Ooh!

17:38.599 --> 17:39.850
What a rush!

17:44.980 --> 17:46.231
[loud thud]

17:47.649 --> 17:48.734
Oh, no, no, no!

17:52.237 --> 17:53.072
What?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.365
[creaking]

18:01.830 --> 18:03.832
[inspirational music playing] 

18:03.916 --> 18:05.209
[grunting]

18:13.300 --> 18:14.635
Shoot! My favorite shirt.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.516
I've been all around the world
rocking rings across the globe,

18:20.599 --> 18:23.769
and I have never seen
a sorrier sight than you.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.354
What's that?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.022
Bring it? [chuckles]

18:27.523 --> 18:28.857
Oh, your boy's about to.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.484
[grunts]

18:34.154 --> 18:36.156
[dogs barking] 

18:42.830 --> 18:45.582
[intense hip-hop instrumental playing]

18:45.666 --> 18:46.708
[inhales deeply]

19:22.119 --> 19:25.789
{\an8}"Legend has it that this mask's
mystical powers

19:25.873 --> 19:30.085
only work for competitors
who are truly deserving of its magic.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.213
The mask itself decides who is worthy.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.134
The mask was last seen 50 years ago."

19:37.759 --> 19:38.719
Whoa.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.686
[Trevor] Your little buddy Leo
ran away from us.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.564
So now, we're gonna have to take out
our frustrations on you two.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.065
[both grunting]

19:52.149 --> 19:53.400
Guys, just relax.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.319
[Trevor] I'm gonna break your face, nerd.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.071
[Riyaz] I prefer the term
"intellectually advanced person."

19:58.155 --> 20:00.324
Trevor, seriously. Not cool.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.700
[Riyaz] Guys, somebody!

20:03.035 --> 20:05.204
Yeah, Trevor. Not cool.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.459
I think you should leave them alone.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.212
All right. Fine.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.796
I'll leave them alone.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.216
You, however, are a different story.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.219
[kids chattering] 

20:20.427 --> 20:21.386
[Luke] Whoa!

20:21.470 --> 20:22.846
-Hey!
-Wait, no!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.807
[whimpering]

20:25.933 --> 20:27.226
[laughter]

20:27.309 --> 20:28.518
[laughing]

20:28.602 --> 20:29.853
Trevor, Mason, and Luke.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.396
Principal's office, now.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.314
What?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.274
But we're the ones
hanging by our underwear.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.400
Uh...

20:36.360 --> 20:39.321
Leo? Principal's office. Now.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.033
Uh, which way is it?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.410
Second door to the left,
right before the bathrooms.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.411
Got it.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.205
-[clapping]
-Leo!

20:48.830 --> 20:49.998
[girl] Go, Leo!

20:57.005 --> 20:58.465
What were you thinking? Huh? 

21:00.008 --> 21:01.301
There's three of them.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.844
They could have really hurt you.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.056
You're right. I'm sorry.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.978
Just promise me no more fighting. Okay?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.438
You're better than that.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.524
You're better than them.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.860
They're bigger than you, sure,
but you're stronger than them.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.320
In here and in here.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.363
All right?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.411
Wow, that was really sweet, man.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.580
You are definitely getting five stars.
Yeah.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.500
[inhales] Mmm. 

21:35.502 --> 21:37.421
[Riyaz] That was
the coolest thing ever today.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.131
I guess that was pretty cool.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.757
My dad didn't like it, though.

21:40.841 --> 21:41.800
Who cares?

21:41.883 --> 21:43.635
The whole school is talking about it.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.053
-Really?
-[Riyaz] Yeah, dude.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.430
How'd you do it, though?

21:46.513 --> 21:48.849
It seemed physically impossible,
no offense.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.642
Well...

21:51.810 --> 21:53.770
Oh, look! <i>SmackDown's</i> back on.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.607
<i>Tomorrow in Fallbridge,</i>
<i>WWE kicks off its search</i>

21:57.691 --> 22:00.027
<i>to find the next NXT Superstar.</i>

22:00.360 --> 22:02.863
<i>But one man has already registered.</i>

22:02.946 --> 22:05.324
<i>Or should I say one monster?</i>

22:05.782 --> 22:09.828
<i>The entire WWE roster should be</i>
<i>shaking in their boots right now,</i>

22:09.911 --> 22:13.373
<i>because Samson has arrived, baby!</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:15.500
<i>Remember the name. Samson.</i>

22:15.917 --> 22:17.336
<i>And also Frankie Albano.</i>

22:17.419 --> 22:19.379
<i>That's me, I'm his manager.</i>
<i>Remember that name, too.</i>

22:19.463 --> 22:20.464
<i>Both names.</i>

22:21.006 --> 22:24.259
Dude, he's huge. He's gotta be a shoo-in
for that $50,000.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.055
Fifty thousand dollars.

22:30.223 --> 22:33.935
[deep-voiced] All you jabronis better
know your role, and stay out of my lane.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.733
[regular voice] I look ridiculous.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.568
[deep-voiced] "Cowabunga, dude!"

22:41.651 --> 22:44.154
"I came here to chew bubblegum
and kick butt,

22:44.237 --> 22:45.989
but I'm all out of bubblegum."

22:46.073 --> 22:48.617
Thompson. Leo Thompson.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.910
[yells]

22:50.744 --> 22:55.040
"Can you smell...

22:55.123 --> 22:56.291
what Leo is..."

22:57.167 --> 22:59.044
No. I can't pull that one off.

22:59.127 --> 23:04.132
"This is <i>Sparta!"</i>

23:04.216 --> 23:06.510
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

23:06.593 --> 23:08.261
your champ is here.

23:09.262 --> 23:10.764
Yeah. [chuckles] 

23:20.649 --> 23:23.193
[scoffs] Chuck E. Cheese
is a block over, kid.

23:23.276 --> 23:26.696
[men laughing] 

23:27.614 --> 23:28.824
Now I'm hungry.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.720
[exhales]

23:51.012 --> 23:51.972
Here we go.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.184
[woman] Next!

23:58.437 --> 24:00.397
You're a little small for this,
aren't you?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.606
You know what they say.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.109
"Great things come in small packages."

24:04.609 --> 24:06.695
Whatever. What is your wrestling name?

24:07.654 --> 24:09.156
My wrestling name...

24:10.198 --> 24:13.076
Okay, come on. If you wanna compete,
I need a name.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.911
And you should really think
about changing,

24:14.995 --> 24:16.705
'cause you will be on television.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.210
My name is Kid Chaos.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.880
Next!

24:28.884 --> 24:30.886
[men laughing]

24:34.639 --> 24:37.017
Look at this guy. Never seen him before. 

24:40.562 --> 24:42.397
Get out of my seat, you little worm.

24:44.941 --> 24:45.775
Hey.

How's it going out there?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.060
I'm sure you're crushing it.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.562
[Denise] Leo, come down here!

38:37.315 --> 38:38.566
-Oh--

38:39.108 --> 38:40.359
[Leo] Huh. Erica...

38:40.860 --> 38:43.696
Oh. Hey. What are you doing here?

38:43.779 --> 38:47.325
I know I said I'd call, but I take
dance lessons right down the street,

38:47.408 --> 38:49.785
so I figured I'd just come over.
Is that okay?

38:50.202 --> 38:51.120
Uh...

38:52.038 --> 38:54.707
Of course, it's okay. It's fine, sweetie.
[laughs]

38:54.790 --> 38:58.210
Yeah, it's totally okay. I just, uh...

38:58.794 --> 39:00.629
Uh... give me a second, okay?

39:01.839 --> 39:04.717
You know, that is so crazy
that you're a dancer,

39:04.800 --> 39:06.052
because I'm a dancer, too.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.929

I was a pop lock master.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.032
Okay. Just breathe.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.700
You can do this.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.869
You can be cool.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.455
Yeah.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.123

Yeah, sure. But first,
let's get you a drink.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.851
I'm good. I got my water.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.562
So you want another drink to go
with your water. Don't worry, I'm on it.

39:58.646 --> 39:59.772
Totally. Got it.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.405
Sorry if I was a little jumpy there.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.448
Not usually my style.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.869
In fact, some people say
I'm cool as the other side of the pillow.

What people say that?

40:15.913 --> 40:16.747

And since I don't want to get you sick
with my cold,

40:20.668 --> 40:23.712
I think I should maybe stay in here
while we work.

But first, let's get you a drink.

40:27.341 --> 40:28.551

Oh, the smell? What smell?

That smell's me.

44:56.777 --> 44:57.695
I, uh...

44:58.821 --> 45:02.658
I was realizing that we haven't
spent much time together, you know?

45:02.741 --> 45:08.122
And... we definitely haven't had time
to have a man-to-man conversation, so...

45:09.206 --> 45:10.374
Okay...

Well, if you really wanna have
a man-to-man talk,

45:32.855 --> 45:35.315
I was thinking,
and since Mom's gone and stuff--

45:35.399 --> 45:37.484
I do wanna have a man-to-man talk.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.862
And I was thinking, too, uh, you know,

45:39.987 --> 45:42.990
I haven't had a chance really to show you
what I do, and so I was thinking,

45:43.073 --> 45:45.200
God forbid you break down
on the side of the road or something,

45:45.284 --> 45:47.202
you should know what a fuel filter is.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.996
Which is this thing right here.

-So this thing, especially these old--
-Dad.

do this another time?

at the diner.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.215
You're going out?

46:01.550 --> 46:04.094

-Yeah.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.150
When will I get to see Mom again?

46:22.571 --> 46:23.572
I don't know.

46:26.867 --> 46:27.868
We'll figure it out.

46:29.119 --> 46:29.953
I promise.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.456
Okay.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.377
Have fun. Have a good time.

46:38.712 --> 46:39.880

46:51.683 --> 46:52.851
So, check it.

What if Kid Chaos is actually
just Kevin Hart in a mask,

46:56.605 --> 46:58.190

46:58.273 --> 46:59.608
Maybe he's a method actor.

46:59.691 --> 47:02.277
That's insane. He's not that small.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.531
-Kid Chaos is, like, Leo's size.
-Mmm.

47:07.574 --> 47:10.327
Erica, why're you hanging out
with these weirdos?

47:10.410 --> 47:14.623
They're not weirdos, they're my friends.
And also,

47:14.706 --> 47:17.459
one of them hung you up
by your underpants the other day.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.211
So maybe you should be a little nicer.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.340

47:33.267 --> 47:35.686

47:35.769 --> 47:37.437
-No! We totally do!
-We do!

-Yeah.

So, any of you doing the talent show?

47:40.774 --> 47:44.194
I was gonna submit my short film,
but I doubt I'll finish it in time.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.029
You haven't even started it, man.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.906
That's why I doubt I'll finish it.

47:47.990 --> 47:49.783
[sighs] You infuriate me.

47:50.784 --> 47:52.369
Wait. Are you gonna do it?

47:52.953 --> 47:54.997
Put your dancing lessons to use?

47:55.080 --> 47:57.165
I don't know. It's a big crowd,

47:57.249 --> 47:59.293
and I'd be up there all alone. So...

47:59.751 --> 48:00.586
Well...

48:01.169 --> 48:02.546
what if I dance with you?

48:03.171 --> 48:05.173
Wait, really? You'd do that?

48:05.257 --> 48:07.259
Yeah. <i>You'd</i> do that?

48:07.509 --> 48:08.385
Yeah.

48:08.760 --> 48:09.887
I'm not that great,

48:10.178 --> 48:12.806
but if you want me to, I'll give it a try.
I mean...

48:13.265 --> 48:14.391

48:25.736 --> 48:26.945
Okay, don't freak out.

48:27.029 --> 48:29.448
There's a guy robbing the place,
and you're telling us not to freak out?

48:29.531 --> 48:30.365
What are you--

48:30.449 --> 48:31.575
[all] Ugh!

tell you guys before, and...

met someone else and moved to New York?

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.828
Well, Miz,

01:31:41.245 --> 01:31:42.371
at the end of the day,

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:44.165
I won because...

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:47.084
I had some really great people
in my corner.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.378
[cheering]

01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:50.505
That's great.

01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.340
We've got a little problem.

01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:55.092
We can't have an 11-year-old
wrestling in WWE, can we?

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:57.470
That's correct. We cannot
have an 11-year-old

01:31:57.553 --> 01:32:00.890
wrestling in the WWE. It's not safe.
He's not allowed to do it.

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:02.016
But I love you.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.560
Probably not the best idea.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.563
But I have a way we can fix this.

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:10.816
Since I won, how about
I pick my replacement?

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:12.777
Do you have someone in mind?

01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:15.154
Yes, I do.

01:32:15.404 --> 01:32:17.990
Smooth Operator, get down here!

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:19.158
What?

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.119
[Leo] Come on, Smooth!

01:32:22.745 --> 01:32:23.621
Come on!

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:27.124
He's wanted this ever since he was my age.

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:29.752
What do you guys think?

That was amazing!

Leo, there's just one thing left to do.

01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:34.900
I don't think so, you little brat!

Hey, man.

That was a brave thing you did.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.253
I had to come congratulate you myself.

01:35:17.336 --> 01:35:19.046
Wow. Thanks, Kofi.

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:20.881
And you must be the proud father?

I'll see you in ten years, Kofi.
