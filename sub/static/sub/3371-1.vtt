04:46.352 --> 04:49.472
Hi, you called Jude and Celia.
We can not answer now.

04:49.572 --> 04:51.275
Leave your name and number
that will call later.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.375
Drugs.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.032
Marinated in a wine garlic sauce...

04:59.132 --> 05:01.760
Hello.
- What goes in a salad?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.671
Is making salad for him?
- And I am.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.321
Why?
- Well, because I asked...

05:07.372 --> 05:09.993
What he wanted and he said he had lunch
late...

05:10.093 --> 05:11.794
That was too hot to cook.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.563
Spake: 'Why does a light salad...'

05:13.663 --> 05:15.299
and I'll bring the wine?'.
I said, 'Fine.'

05:15.399 --> 05:18.442
But you do not eat salad.
- I know.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.170
Well, now will have to eat salad.

05:21.270 --> 05:24.280
Yeah, I know. I put?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.609
Expected, how old he is older?

05:26.709 --> 05:29.929
Are 17 years.
've Talked about it, Shelly.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.899
I need...
- How many meetings have been?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
Ones 10, I think.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.955
We worked together for three months when
he was a consultant that project...

05:39.055 --> 05:40.790
So we know well.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.243
No more questions, I want to help.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.343
I like it...

05:45.545 --> 05:47.545
Yeah, me too.

05:47.914 --> 05:51.517
It is fabulous.
I wanted to make a salad for him.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.677
Buffalo Mozzarella, lettuce...

05:55.021 --> 05:59.958
Bread, olive oil, vinegar, basil,
garlic, salt and pepper.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.278
This is a caprese salad,
think I can do.

06:02.378 --> 06:04.914
And he has the most
17 years of experience in bed?

06:05.014 --> 06:07.014
Yes, he has.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.791
I love you.
- I love you too.

06:19.645 --> 06:24.173
BETWEEN WINE AND LOVES (2007)
Legend: @ ARR ZZO.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.606
She has another meeting with that guy.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.706
Who?
- The Lily.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.975
The older guy?
- It is.

06:51.944 --> 06:56.115
I thought you liked him.
- I like it, it's just that...

06:56.215 --> 06:59.275
He is much older.
- This is too much.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.955
You see nothing wrong with
the age difference?

07:03.055 --> 07:05.575
She likes him?
- Yes, it's ridiculous.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.911
She calls him 'Knight in Shining Armor
,' 'Mr. Wonderful'.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.513
All that crap.

07:10.613 --> 07:13.333
It is not with the crap that
every little girl dreams?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.433
Love.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.055
So is saying that she is happy.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.155
Well, it is, but...

07:22.442 --> 07:24.442
So what's the problem?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.946
Nevermind.

07:27.046 --> 07:31.267
Look, he's a guy of 47 years.
With a writer hot 30...

07:31.367 --> 07:34.504
Career about to take off.
And who needs her space...

07:34.604 --> 07:37.190
So she gives to every guy who comes out.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.593
That man will lick the floor at her feet.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.446
Actually, bet he licks.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.432
Love, I'm serious.
- I'm also serious.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.997
I think it's perfect for her.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.802
You do not know.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.971
No, but I know her.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.528
And she never brought it here to
give a person the least of her.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.446
Much less make her happy.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.166
In addition, it is the combination not age.

08:03.266 --> 08:06.481
And these two together.
I feel it.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.978
As you and I, Shelly.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.518
Where's the phone?
- Why?

08:16.629 --> 08:19.179
I'll do something nice for us.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.100
What?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
I'll order a pizza.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.971
What? No.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.673
What is Shelly?

08:31.911 --> 08:34.263
If I stayed in the kitchen
and learn with me...

08:34.363 --> 08:37.417
Would do this together.
Would be much better.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.577
I just got home from work.
- Me too.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.618
I do not like to cook.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.226
But I like it. Strive to me.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.316
Like to cook?
- We will have a baby.

08:53.416 --> 08:56.646
Someone has to start to enjoy cooking.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.621
You make great salads.
We can eat a salad.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.931
Hey, where are you going?

09:03.342 --> 09:05.503
Ask your damn pizza.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.490
Hi - Hi.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.749
Health.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.120
Wait.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.105
If you do eye contact, bad luck.

10:57.205 --> 11:00.716
It?
- Seven years of bad sex.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.690
I did not know it.
- No?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.949
It was good to know each other then.

11:06.049 --> 11:08.523
What if we had not known?

11:09.735 --> 11:11.521
It would have been a great tragedy.

11:11.621 --> 11:14.038
Saved my life, thank you.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.546
What a delight.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.098
Nebbiolo.

11:22.198 --> 11:24.198
I love it.
- Good.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.266
Thank portrazer.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.153
And then?
- And then?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.651
Have you ever been married?

11:33.592 --> 11:36.060
No.
- And will you marry?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.281
Pardon me?

11:39.381 --> 11:41.350
Do you want to get married?

11:41.450 --> 11:44.170
This is a request or a question?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.022
It's a question.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.303
Okay, okay. Good..

11:50.509 --> 11:53.842
I want. Is, yes. I want to.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.064
I mean, it depends.
Not have to do with marriage...

11:56.164 --> 11:57.267
Do not have to happen.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.201
I'm not dying of desire to marry.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.238
If it happens, it will be cool.
If not, okay.

12:02.338 --> 12:04.407
I just want serfeliz and enjoy life.

12:04.507 --> 12:06.242
Why do not you married?

12:06.342 --> 12:09.912
It's out of fashion.
- What does this mean?

12:13.799 --> 12:16.097
Everyone is divorced.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.555
Not everyone who divorces.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.631
Divorce, fill and move on.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.742
Not in a real marriage.

12:24.801 --> 12:27.008
Ah, yes.
- No.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.446
Here. And women...

12:30.883 --> 12:34.387
Betray them as much as men.
In fact, even more.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.939
There are statistics.
- Just talking about it...

12:37.039 --> 12:38.457
Because we are in Hollywood.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.209
Normal people who live out here...

12:40.309 --> 12:43.646
Stay together more than 5 minutes.
- Normal people cheat.

12:43.746 --> 12:47.883
There are a few that last.
Has Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn.

12:47.983 --> 12:50.653
And Cameron Diaz used to be a singer...
and that.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.729
But that ended. That's it.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.293
They do not even married.
And I bet betrayed.

12:57.393 --> 12:59.433
Okay, you have problems.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.869
I? I have no problems.
- Oh really?

13:07.186 --> 13:11.691
I've tried many things in life
, but were in the past.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.419
People betray and lie.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.847
Reality I know more now than before.

13:17.947 --> 13:19.947
Is that right?

13:24.370 --> 13:27.222
What does this mean?
What you do not want to marry?

13:27.322 --> 13:30.126
Do not querter
a monogamous relationship?

13:30.226 --> 13:34.636
No. I mean I think marriage is outdated.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.982
Right.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.151
How many bottles did you bring?

13:39.251 --> 13:40.903
2.
- Great.

13:41.003 --> 13:43.706
Think you can?
- Here's 5 minutes...

13:43.806 --> 13:45.725
And we are already in marriage.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.715
Shall I go back to the store?
- No.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.963
Not yet.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.273
It's all you have?
- It is.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.033
That's all?

13:56.502 --> 13:59.596
It. I do not like salad.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.005
Do not eat salad?
- No.

14:02.081 --> 14:04.794
Why not eat salad?
- I do not know.

14:04.894 --> 14:07.496
So why do we have salad for dinner?

14:07.596 --> 14:11.150
Because you wanted a salad and
is too hot to cook.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.702
And I thought it was time to
get used to eating salad.

14:13.802 --> 14:17.473
I should... eating salad.
- Good, but was for your good...

14:17.573 --> 14:20.242
Not because of me.
- No, not because of you...

14:20.342 --> 14:25.431
Is one thing I wanted to start eating
. Your request cheered me up.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.625
Okay. So we have a caprese.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.349
Let's see, what you dislike?

14:32.605 --> 14:35.207
What I like is the bread and cheese.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.459
That's it? No...
- And pepper.

14:37.559 --> 14:39.559
And pepper?

14:39.678 --> 14:44.166
So with all these things you
not like, what will we do?

14:44.266 --> 14:46.018
I do not know.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.328
Let's see. Let's make a...

14:48.587 --> 14:50.587
Salad Lily.

14:50.672 --> 14:54.251
Okay, but I am very sick.
- I know.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.119
It basil?

14:59.398 --> 15:01.398
Tenho.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.629
Great. And is it cool?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.700
I think you need to think about it.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.103
It is the seventh month of pregnancy and
everything seems much bigger than it is.

15:21.203 --> 15:24.006
No, not that.
I'm not one of those pregnant...

15:24.106 --> 15:27.081
Who is freaking out the whole time.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.646
True, but is not it this time.

15:30.746 --> 15:32.746
Ok, then what is?

15:32.797 --> 15:34.797
That's all.

15:35.234 --> 15:38.487
'All' has to do with everyday things?

15:38.587 --> 15:42.098
It.
Has much to do with everyday life.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.283
Always have. And now has to deal with it
being pregnant.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.846
This is not fair.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.949
But the reality is.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.791
Try this one.
- Our.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.835
Oh my God.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.672
My God.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.002
You see that?
That's the problem.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.030
What? A good bruschetta?

16:21.130 --> 16:23.947
I can not cook.
- So learn.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.116
I'm trying.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.655
But Chris does not participate.
He acts like a sexist.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.070
I think he just did not bother to cook.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.445
Do you want to mount the cradle
and paint the baby's room?

16:36.545 --> 16:37.897
No.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.727
But he wants, right?
- Yes.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.433
This is the part of it.
Cooking is yours.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.155
People are what they are, Shelly.

16:46.255 --> 16:50.403
We can change that, but
generally do not change.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.796
Okay, while being honest with you.

16:53.896 --> 16:56.701
Needless to say this to you.
- No.

16:56.882 --> 17:00.269
By the way, cooking is not for me.
I'm not good at it.

17:00.369 --> 17:03.305
I bought all these books idiots, but I'm not...

17:03.405 --> 17:06.809
No idea what I'm doing.
- So do not come naturally...

17:06.909 --> 17:09.327
DNA I do not have to do it.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.915
Look at you. Not not paying attention.

17:13.015 --> 17:14.782
What are you doing?

17:14.883 --> 17:18.119
I watch the I like to eat, then I do.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.923
Everything has to do with combining
things. It's like your clothes.

17:21.022 --> 17:23.092
Nice combination, indeed.
- Thank you.

17:23.192 --> 17:27.212
It's the same thing.
- Can you teach me some tricks?

17:27.311 --> 17:30.202
Can each cooking 2 times per week.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.901
It'll be nice.
- Do not you care?

17:33.001 --> 17:36.388
The Celia did not really enjoy
cooking, it is always shooting.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.488
So it might be fun.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.124
You are so lucky.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.229
Why?
- Because you're a lesbian.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.485
What?
- Women are much more...

17:49.585 --> 17:51.710
Tune with their emotions.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.739
Sure, it's a way to see things.

17:54.798 --> 17:57.092
But it is true, no?
I mean, she comes home...

17:57.192 --> 17:59.561
Tells us about her day.
You count as yours.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.798
You have much to talk about what
and vent, if needed.

18:02.898 --> 18:05.134
Or get excited. I ask Chris...

18:05.234 --> 18:08.804
As his day and he said 'Great.' That's it.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.219
But this is not bad, huh?

18:12.791 --> 18:17.146
Well, you and Celia
share every detail with one another.

18:17.246 --> 18:20.051
They are lovers and best friends.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.152
This is what we are.
Best friends and lovers.

18:23.252 --> 18:25.921
I love it.
- Okay, so you like the idea...

18:26.021 --> 18:28.191
...2 women competing
to vent at the end of the day...

18:28.291 --> 18:31.351
While a guy is just there listening?

18:34.646 --> 18:35.914
It.

18:36.014 --> 18:38.054
This is called estrogen.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.054
Best friends and lovers
are important roles...

18:42.154 --> 18:45.624
But that does not make our relationship
nothing ideal.

18:45.724 --> 18:50.314
I think so. At least you
she hears and understands you.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.096
Yeah, right.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.703
Hello.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.606
Speak of the devil...

19:03.142 --> 19:07.146
What are you doing?
- Here I am cooking with Shelly.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.976
Have you finished?
- No.

19:10.549 --> 19:14.629
Any predictions?
- They just bring pizza, then...

19:14.987 --> 19:18.650
Will take a while.
3 hours at least.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.258
Okay.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.259
I love you.
- Me too.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.705
More bruschetta?

19:37.409 --> 19:40.003
Thank you.
- Sure.

19:43.515 --> 19:47.383
How is the wait?
- I do not care if it takes.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.819
I like the team.

19:50.756 --> 19:54.496
So, how is to stay here
hidden in the corner?

20:51.049 --> 20:53.602
Yeah, but I think it has to do
be honest with you...

20:53.702 --> 20:56.939
With yourself and with others about
what they are doing together...

20:57.039 --> 20:59.039
And how they feel real.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.998
Marriage is a relationship only
you already have.

21:06.098 --> 21:11.538
Marriage is just a celebration of this act.
And make it official.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.840
It is a legal documentation,
then in that sense...

21:14.940 --> 21:17.915
I would like to be a real marriage.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.812
This is something that is not
strength, just happens.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.497
Or not.

21:22.597 --> 21:26.218
I can do without the drama of
marriage, all the crap...

21:26.318 --> 21:29.446
But qualquerforma,
I believe in love.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.789
And I love jewelry.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.292
I'll keep that in mind.
- It should.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.810
Have you lived with someone?

21:41.700 --> 21:44.820
Almost.
- Ended up changing my mind?

21:44.920 --> 21:48.690
No. We were in the house a
the other almost every night.

21:48.790 --> 21:52.244
I was there and she had things
things in my house.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.413
This is not living together.

21:54.513 --> 21:58.000
We had the same house, but
we lived our lives together.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.135
Yeah, but that's the fun part.
Mean...

22:00.235 --> 22:03.472
Live together is to divide
the space in the closet...

22:03.572 --> 22:07.175
Undertake to paint the wall,
accepting a mobile ugly...

22:07.275 --> 22:08.927
Yes it is to live together.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.912
Do you have experience with this?

22:11.012 --> 22:13.817
Oh, God. I have.
- More than once?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.501
Four times.
- 4 times?

22:18.577 --> 22:20.577
It.

22:20.739 --> 22:24.042
I do not know what I was thinking of none.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.944
I was in love?

22:26.044 --> 22:28.376
Everyone had bad habits.

22:28.980 --> 22:33.852
There were bad men, but I do not
should have gone live with them.

22:33.952 --> 22:37.589
I was very insecure about men
when I was younger.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.689
Why was it unsafe?

22:41.259 --> 22:44.346
I do not know. But thought it had to be...

22:44.446 --> 22:46.615
In a relationship to be happy.

22:46.715 --> 22:48.750
And now when I look at my 20 years...

22:48.850 --> 22:51.520
The time that I was not happy, or when
was...

22:51.620 --> 22:53.356
These relationships that
I thought I needed...

22:53.456 --> 22:54.690
But I did not need.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.265
But did it anyway.
- I did.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.476
I was young.

23:00.112 --> 23:03.899
I was a girl of 20 years extremely dramatic.

23:03.999 --> 23:07.769
Now What?
- I'm in my 30 and love it.

23:07.869 --> 23:10.583
Why?
- It is much easier.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.355
I mean... It is what it is, but...

23:15.127 --> 23:18.046
I know very well what I want
and I know what I want.

23:18.146 --> 23:21.577
And I'm not afraid of two things.
Life is life.

23:21.677 --> 23:25.003
Ah, is it? Life is life?
Is the key to you?

23:25.103 --> 23:29.369
Yes Were you surprised by that?
- Well, a little.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.362
Generally have a little more than that.

23:33.462 --> 23:36.164
With most women,
the big decisions of life...

23:36.264 --> 23:39.284
Or is the answer to everything
or the end of the world.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.217
It seems to be generally so.

23:42.788 --> 23:46.280
I was that way.
Then one day, gone.

23:47.159 --> 23:51.530
Do not know if it's because I'm
more comfortable with myself...

23:51.630 --> 23:54.030
Or if I woke up one day...

23:55.167 --> 23:57.185
And was tired of living like this...

23:57.285 --> 24:00.175
But the two forms,
is a good thing.

24:00.338 --> 24:03.241
It's very good you will not be afraid.

24:03.341 --> 24:07.679
I have my moments, but also
is not the end of the world.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.779
Like what?

24:10.515 --> 24:12.267
What kind of time you have?

24:12.367 --> 24:14.797
Frightened you?
- No.

24:14.897 --> 24:17.172
It was only a question.

24:17.272 --> 24:19.272
Okay.

24:19.825 --> 24:23.820
What kinds of moments I have?
- What scares you?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.962
Bad judgment.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.047
It happens.

24:28.667 --> 24:33.872
Yeah, but usually you is not the only
person who pays the price for it.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.690
It's part of life.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.903
I think so. So what scares you?

24:39.778 --> 24:41.973
Nothing.
- Nothing?

24:42.347 --> 24:46.340
Nothing.
- What is, must have something.

24:46.551 --> 24:49.471
Well, actually...
salad dressing ready...

24:49.571 --> 24:51.571
Freaks me out.
- What.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.646
Well, come on.
Get down from there.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.543
What will you do?
- You'll see.

24:58.330 --> 25:03.001
Go do something from scratch, is not it?
- No, we will. Together.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.854
Lemon. Is the right thing.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.539
The right thing?

25:07.639 --> 25:09.869
It is the right thing.

25:09.975 --> 25:14.139
I wish he lend more attention. I'm...

25:15.113 --> 25:19.049
Pregnant, married, live in an apartment.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.171
Work at a movie studio
doing absolutely nothing creative...

25:23.271 --> 25:27.359
Just creating excuses
's why I'm taking the day off.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.028
I should be building movie sets...

25:30.128 --> 25:34.149
And living in a house with a pool.
I do not know how I got here.

25:34.249 --> 25:36.284
Well, you made the choices that brought
here.

25:36.384 --> 25:38.570
Are you really so unhappy with them?

25:38.670 --> 25:41.540
No. I just do not know what I'm doing.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.660
What are you afraid of?
- At the moment, to win over 1 kg.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.963
Whatever you're doing,
smells amazing.

25:48.063 --> 25:50.599
I know that cheese has enough stuffing to
a horse.

25:50.699 --> 25:53.301
Well, the cheese is good for the soul
and the small bones.

25:53.401 --> 25:56.684
So what if gaining weight 7 Kg?
- 8 Kg.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.022
What seem to eighty.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.257
, but are not.

26:01.308 --> 26:04.198
Well, I can no longer see my feet.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.591
The baby will love it here.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.501
How is your cholesterol?
- Low.

26:11.102 --> 26:14.469
Really? Impressive.
- I do not know why.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.911
I think...

26:23.348 --> 26:27.079
Terrifying the fuck is Chris.

26:27.719 --> 26:30.552
In what way?
- Of all the ways.

26:32.824 --> 26:37.625
You know, I always start.
And he never.

26:38.029 --> 26:42.951
And I want, but the more
I do, I do not like so much...

26:43.051 --> 26:44.686
The way I think you should like.

26:44.786 --> 26:47.676
Why do you think he does not like?

26:47.806 --> 26:50.951
I know he is not.
- Well, does it end?

26:51.047 --> 26:54.872
Yes, but that does not
mean anything to a man.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.867
What is it?
- I think you have...

26:58.967 --> 27:01.545
To give him time.
- No, no.

27:02.220 --> 27:06.122
Look, I think you need a while and he also.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.945
Why?
- Why is your 1st pregnancy...

27:10.045 --> 27:14.749
You're pregnant, it is the 1st
his experience, his is the 1st...

27:14.849 --> 27:17.402
I'm sure he's a little more lost than you.

27:17.502 --> 27:21.156
Think about it. If
Celia puts his hand on her belly...

27:21.256 --> 27:23.875
I feel the baby kick and 1 hour later...

27:23.975 --> 27:27.929
She puts her hand a few inches below
for one thing...

27:28.029 --> 27:31.349
Completely different would be very strange.

27:31.449 --> 27:34.941
This is not helping me.
- But that's life.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.373
I know, I know what life is.
But nothing like that.

27:38.473 --> 27:42.794
I do not think he looks more to me
the same way he looked.

27:42.894 --> 27:48.199
You'll have the baby and return to settle
midnight on the roof quickly.

27:48.299 --> 27:51.757
You know that?
- We got you there.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.905
Oh my God.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.837
Okay,
were there for the same reason.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.278
You'll be fine.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.623
You'll have a baby?

28:15.093 --> 28:19.768
I think I'll wait a bit.
But let's be great babysitters.

28:23.768 --> 28:27.761
I do not know if we will.
- What is happening?

28:28.807 --> 28:30.807
Honey.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.947
Do you think he is cheating on you?

28:36.047 --> 28:38.047
No...

28:38.149 --> 28:40.743
I think not yet.

29:03.341 --> 29:06.469
That's it. And pepper, of course.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.947
Yes.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.750
Yes.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.341
Why did not live with her?
- Who?

29:20.024 --> 29:23.078
The girl spent all the time, he was at home.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.596
Why not.
- Why?

29:26.564 --> 29:29.114
It was not what we were doing.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.234
Why?

29:32.137 --> 29:36.074
We wanted different things.
- So why were they together?

29:36.174 --> 29:38.802
Because we liked each other.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.480
Even though it would not in any way?

29:42.580 --> 29:45.400
Do not know it would give
somewhere or not.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.120
It was nice for a while and then
was no more.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.220
Okay.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.465
Are avoiding anything with all this talk?

30:00.565 --> 30:02.565
No.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.477
Wow, that's fine.
- See?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.206
No, it is delicious.
- You look so surprised.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.516
I do not like sauce ready.

30:27.604 --> 30:31.196
Do not ready this nonsense.
This is not salad dressing.

30:31.296 --> 30:35.206
This is much better.
- This is the right thing.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.667
So why not believe in marriage?

30:52.817 --> 30:57.322
Why are you worried if
sure that nothing is happening?

30:58.089 --> 31:02.339
'Cause everything is different
now and it has back.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.647
I'm not the girl whom he married...

31:04.747 --> 31:07.467
And he is not the guy I married.

31:07.765 --> 31:12.355
I will be mother of his son.
And it will be the father.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.931
Yeah, and it's beautiful. It growth.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.694
Do you want this baby, Shelly?

31:28.786 --> 31:31.306
I want this baby more than anything.

31:31.406 --> 31:34.943
It's just that this thing is not
Mother's sexiest phase of my life.

31:35.043 --> 31:37.512
And I do not think he will again be
the way it was before.

31:37.612 --> 31:41.115
Okay, things are a little different.

31:41.215 --> 31:43.215
But this is not so bad.

31:43.275 --> 31:45.275
Not totally, but...

31:45.327 --> 31:48.122
Mothers climb on the roof and
have sex under the stars.

31:48.222 --> 31:50.959
Who said that?
- The baby said, I think.

31:51.059 --> 31:54.562
For this there nanny.
- What is. You really think so...

31:54.662 --> 31:56.698
A man will look a woman the same way...

31:56.798 --> 32:00.535
After seeing a baby go through
the same opening tiny...

32:00.635 --> 32:03.865
That until then it was the Holy Grail?

32:04.122 --> 32:07.976
I could have my body back,
whole damn good, in one week.

32:08.076 --> 32:10.745
Could tiny red panties...

32:10.845 --> 32:15.357
A black stilettos, but for him,
I'll still be a 'Mom'.

32:17.268 --> 32:22.113
I'll never be his wife beautiful and sexy
him again. Over.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.487
I think you're exaggerating.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.229
I'm not.

32:28.329 --> 32:31.474
You have this whole thing lesbianism.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.409
I'm serious.
Women are more complex.

32:35.553 --> 32:39.207
We need more than a stiff butt
to be impressed.

32:39.307 --> 32:42.622
We prefer content.
- Speak for yourself.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.714
Gracinha.
- I'm kidding.

32:46.814 --> 32:49.617
That is, more or less.
Just think that is out of plumb...

32:49.717 --> 32:52.153
Hormones are taking over.

32:52.253 --> 32:55.398
I know my hormones are crazy, I know.

32:55.477 --> 32:58.693
But I'm trying to be realistic. That's it.

32:58.793 --> 33:00.962
Men always have a midlife crisis...

33:01.062 --> 33:04.015
And go for the younger
woman. Do you know?

33:04.115 --> 33:05.800
They want to like you as a mother.

33:05.900 --> 33:10.154
At first they try
but it is a fight that can not win.

33:10.254 --> 33:13.441
They are old and distinguished
and before we know it...

33:13.541 --> 33:17.145
Has a new girl and sexy. And with the right
smile across the room...

33:17.245 --> 33:20.515
This marriage was already.
Not only because of her age...

33:20.615 --> 33:24.118
But because she does not have the
baggage of wedding or baby bag.

33:24.218 --> 33:26.337
She has the whole world in front of her.

33:26.437 --> 33:29.090
And all she wants is someone who
be around long enough...

33:29.190 --> 33:33.015
To celebrate with her all the things she did.

33:33.177 --> 33:36.271
Easy. And yet, she loves him.

33:37.915 --> 33:41.655
If I were a man,
I would want the same thing.

33:42.787 --> 33:45.167
Look Lily and this guy down.

33:45.253 --> 33:48.176
He is 17 years older than her.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.276
17.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.982
And he is Photo-Journalist
portodo and travels the world...

33:54.082 --> 33:55.801
Doing God knows what,
with God knows who...

33:55.901 --> 33:56.901
.

33:57.001 --> 34:01.089
You know, in my understanding
he is not married, no children...

34:01.189 --> 34:03.224
And as he goes around the world...

34:03.324 --> 34:06.027
He sends cards and flowers
when not in Los Angeles.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.213
And she's happier than
never seen her with a man.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.331
I think has more than one way to look at it.

34:11.431 --> 34:13.431
It has.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.706
What is it?
- I do not believe we're having...

34:19.806 --> 34:21.775
This conversation.
- Oh, please.

34:21.876 --> 34:24.612
With what they have going on?
'Papaizão' or not.

34:24.712 --> 34:26.837
How not to speak of them?

34:26.893 --> 34:30.518
I'm not talking about them.
- But what are they doing?

34:30.618 --> 34:33.083
What is happening down there?

34:34.871 --> 34:37.931
Why do you care what they are doing?

34:38.876 --> 34:40.594
You need a little flour.

34:40.695 --> 34:42.295
No, I do not need.
- Yes, you need to.

34:42.395 --> 34:43.663
...I do not need.
- I'll be back in a minute.

34:43.763 --> 34:46.737
Shelly, you can not... - 5 minutes.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.073
Hi, I'm Shelly from above.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.134
Of course, since we met.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.359
I came to get some flour.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.589
We're doing a roast and over.
- Oh, and what are baking?

35:41.689 --> 35:44.631
Some cookies...
- Hi.

35:45.443 --> 35:48.503
Hi. I need to flour.
So, how are you?

35:48.600 --> 35:50.615
Well, thank you. And you?

35:50.715 --> 35:51.999
The baby is to soon?

35:52.099 --> 35:54.479
2 months. Thanks for asking.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.815
You have children?
- No.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.823
Yeah... But you querter?

36:00.057 --> 36:02.276
Querter a family?
Want to take root?

36:02.376 --> 36:05.776
It's flour, you say?
- Yes, just one cup.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.949
You think you could
handle a pregnant woman?

36:08.049 --> 36:09.901
Hey.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.387
I just wonder why Lily said
you never married and...

36:12.487 --> 36:13.454
That's it.

36:13.554 --> 36:15.190
It's just a cup.
- Take the whole package.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.425
You better go, before something burn.

36:17.525 --> 36:19.525
But...

36:20.611 --> 36:23.965
Right. We should
dinner together next week.

36:24.065 --> 36:26.300
A dinner would be great,
can I travel...

36:26.400 --> 36:28.953
Next week.
But when I get back...

36:29.053 --> 36:31.613
Ah, travel... Again.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.313
Okay, let Lily score.

36:36.694 --> 36:37.895
Bye, Shelly.
- Right.

36:37.995 --> 36:40.088
Have fun with the salad.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.398
Okay.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.420
Excuse me.
- No need to apologize.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.824
It's a concerned friend.
- It's a bomb of hormones...

36:49.924 --> 36:54.445
Who is bored with his life
and therefore gets the other.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.979
Do not worry.
- Thank you.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.415
Wine?
- Yes, wine.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.504
The wine will be the answer for everything
tonight.

37:02.604 --> 37:05.156
There is nothing wrong with that.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.850
Oh my God. I hope not.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.848
Of course she is angry, but...

37:17.868 --> 37:21.523
Already, then let it go.
Apologize tomorrow.

37:21.598 --> 37:24.258
But I just...
- Do you have...

37:24.358 --> 37:29.033
More serious issues to resolve
than worrying about Lily?

37:29.547 --> 37:31.433
Look, you know,
am very worried...

37:31.533 --> 37:35.786
With everything you just told me
about you, Chris, and this little baby.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.389
Why? Because it is a harsh reality?

37:38.489 --> 37:41.686
Not because it is crazy.
- Really?

38:45.423 --> 38:46.674
Hi - Hi.

38:46.774 --> 38:49.494
Forgot your screenplay.
- I know.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.423
See you tomorrow.
- Wait.

38:54.231 --> 38:56.231
In a hurry?

38:56.282 --> 38:58.326
The studio sent it.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.407
Only one cup?

39:07.712 --> 39:10.007
Well, the bottle is opened.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.448
Accept a drink.

39:18.589 --> 39:20.191
Okay, I thought.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.711
Marriage. A close union,
a combination...

39:23.811 --> 39:26.525
Mating, marriage.
- Is this it?

39:26.697 --> 39:29.967
The dictionary provides
definition, not opinion.

39:30.067 --> 39:33.120
So marriage is
what you think is the definition.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.661
Sure So, what do you think?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.908
In this definition?
- It is.

39:38.008 --> 39:41.228
I think it's very good.
- So you...

39:41.328 --> 39:43.698
Believes it is possible a relationship?

39:43.798 --> 39:46.534
I guess anything is possible.
- You know what I mean.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.569
Listen, can not make a relationship...

39:48.669 --> 39:52.039
Something that is not.
Will be what it is, no matter...

39:52.139 --> 39:56.060
What you want it to be.
- That's what I'm saying.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.980
But the marriage is over.
- But that's what marriage is.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.383
No, society has changed this definition.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.653
Marriage is about terms and
conditions, rules and laws.

40:05.753 --> 40:07.471
Do not you believe it.

40:07.571 --> 40:12.076
Then why else would marry?
- You would not, that's it.

40:12.151 --> 40:15.563
Marry and be in
marriage are different things.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.348
That's what I think.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.067
Marry, I do not care in any way.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.486
But the idea of being in a marriage, I like.

40:24.688 --> 40:27.623
A real marriage,
that's the truth.

40:29.059 --> 40:32.459
Are you saying you do not want to marry.

40:33.531 --> 40:37.618
I'm saying that the only
word that represents...

40:37.718 --> 40:40.762
Something I want to be, is 'Happy.'

40:41.806 --> 40:43.925
And when I say I am happy,
I really want to say that.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.065
Because if not, I'm out.

40:49.246 --> 40:51.246
What is it?

40:51.348 --> 40:55.341
Think we should open the 2nd bottle?

40:56.587 --> 40:58.885
Absolutely.
- Great.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.578
Noticed which basically is saying
that every woman who gives birth...

41:04.678 --> 41:07.481
Is destined to be betrayed
or exchanged for another woman?

41:07.581 --> 41:09.581
No, not every woman.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.319
That is, some homes
think of different ways.

41:12.419 --> 41:15.734
It's just that if they act so or not...

41:15.873 --> 41:18.225
Everyone wants a girl young and carefree...

41:18.325 --> 41:21.112
Has a perfect body and a constant smile...

41:21.212 --> 41:22.564
As the guy who is with Lily...

41:22.664 --> 41:26.500
He just wants a piece of ass
20 years younger than him.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.437
I think is a bit more than that...

41:28.537 --> 41:32.823
But I mean, right or wrong,
is a chance that Lily has.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.960
I just do not think she
want to see him as he is.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.113
And you do not give him the
benefit of the doubt, I mean...

41:38.213 --> 41:43.313
Does not matter, why are not you
that is down there with him.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.877
Spoke to someone about it?

41:46.770 --> 41:48.770
Who? What?

41:49.673 --> 41:51.509
Do you need help.

41:51.609 --> 41:54.754
I know, that's why 'm talking to you.

41:56.146 --> 42:00.234
Well, you began to speak when
her husband asked pizza.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.536
I think I need professional help, I mean...

42:02.636 --> 42:04.538
At least go see your OB...

42:04.638 --> 42:07.041
And see if it's a phase normal pregnancy.

42:07.141 --> 42:08.642
It's normal.

42:08.742 --> 42:13.162
These are all normal things,
that's what I'm worried.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.602
You know, that's not what I meant.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.702
It.

42:25.142 --> 42:27.142
What about you?

42:28.212 --> 42:30.212
For my what?

42:30.848 --> 42:33.248
Well, already been tried?

42:34.518 --> 42:36.170
With what?

42:36.270 --> 42:40.384
You know what. I mean, even
is why we are here?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.523
You think I'm projecting?

42:49.934 --> 42:54.171
Designing? Well, it better be
reading self-help books.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.271
I'm not projecting.

42:56.540 --> 42:58.540
Okay.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.809
You are attracted to someone?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.589
Drugs.

43:14.725 --> 43:17.489
You are.
- No.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.366
Oh, shit.

43:25.569 --> 43:30.233
Okay. They are only their
hormones are crazy.

43:30.541 --> 43:35.205
I not only thought about it. I did.

43:43.821 --> 43:47.901
'Oh Damn' is really the answer
right here, right?

43:48.525 --> 43:50.294
The hormones are...

43:50.394 --> 43:52.555
There are hormones.

43:59.770 --> 44:04.400
It was... desire.
Was almost one year ago.

44:18.122 --> 44:20.784
Was a guy in accounting...

44:21.925 --> 44:26.005
And he was working late
and I was working late...

44:26.084 --> 44:28.719
And had no one in the building.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.485
It was not planned.

44:31.585 --> 44:32.654
He not even know I was there...

44:32.754 --> 44:35.539
He came to leave a cost reporting...

44:35.639 --> 44:37.391
So be there by morning.

44:37.491 --> 44:40.976
2 And we were working very hard for days.

44:43.747 --> 44:46.016
I do not know what happened.

44:46.116 --> 44:49.916
I had never been attracted to him before.

44:54.091 --> 44:57.491
We have not said anything to each other.

44:59.029 --> 45:03.984
Was something,
something in the air, I do not know...

45:04.084 --> 45:06.549
For more ridiculous it seems.

45:08.605 --> 45:10.605
I think...

45:11.975 --> 45:16.530
My biggest regret is knowing
how much it hurt Chris...

45:16.630 --> 45:18.630
If he found out.

45:21.852 --> 45:24.912
Why are you looking at me like that?

45:33.664 --> 45:36.565
Well, almost a year.

45:38.902 --> 45:41.928
No, I menstruei one week later.

45:42.039 --> 45:45.531
E pregnant two weeks after that.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.711
Do you think I'm the devil.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.921
No, I think.

46:04.695 --> 46:07.892
Why keeps looking at me like that?

46:08.999 --> 46:11.058
Well, it's just that...

46:11.668 --> 46:15.739
If I had done
a list of people who never betrayed...

46:15.839 --> 46:18.049
You would be on top of it.

46:20.744 --> 46:24.248
Do you think all this fear
you're feeling tonight...

46:24.348 --> 46:26.813
Is actually about that night?

46:27.718 --> 46:31.472
No, I... I is now considering?

46:31.572 --> 46:33.572
I can not help.

46:37.561 --> 46:43.001
You are assuming that since you
betrayed him, he will betray you?

46:43.667 --> 46:45.667
No, I do not know.

46:46.603 --> 46:52.213
I do not know if I have more fear
he betray me, betray me than not.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.895
I think my biggest problem is...

46:54.995 --> 46:57.865
I need to figure out if I less like who I am...

46:57.965 --> 47:01.195
Before discovering what I really want.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.659
Understood.

47:12.029 --> 47:14.029
Got it?

47:15.899 --> 47:17.651
You'll have a baby...

47:17.751 --> 47:21.831
And what you want
not come in 1st place for long.

47:25.142 --> 47:28.634
Sorry, is how it happens.

47:31.381 --> 47:33.381
I know.

47:36.253 --> 47:41.555
You know, marriage has many rules
that confuse people.

47:41.725 --> 47:43.545
Instead,
pay more attention to the rules...

47:43.645 --> 47:45.312
Rather than how they feel...

47:45.412 --> 47:48.065
And what they want for
themselves and for the other.

47:48.165 --> 47:50.901
They forget the relationship
and before they realize...

47:51.001 --> 47:54.221
Temptation begins to circle, and they
not even know why.

47:54.321 --> 47:56.290
Why is not in the rulebook.

47:56.390 --> 47:59.110
Seems is a place I've ever been.

47:59.409 --> 48:00.628
I have never been married.

48:00.728 --> 48:04.515
I know, but you went through some
thing that inspired this statement.

48:04.615 --> 48:08.969
Partly, but not as much as
I've seen people passing by.

48:09.069 --> 48:11.805
I have two friends who are now divorcing.

48:11.905 --> 48:13.905
I'm sorry.

48:14.124 --> 48:16.124
It's a shame.

48:16.293 --> 48:18.962
Kevin is with his wife 16 years ago...

48:19.062 --> 48:22.032
And my other friends have
been together for 23.

48:22.132 --> 48:24.568
And you are a friend of
the husband and wife?

48:24.668 --> 48:27.588
You think you know someone
and 20 years later...

48:27.688 --> 48:29.923
Discovers that they have a hand
has ever known.

48:30.023 --> 48:32.023
Or maybe they knew.

48:32.099 --> 48:36.046
Until one day, suddenly,
everything was different...

48:36.146 --> 48:38.182
And now everyone is fighting.

48:38.282 --> 48:39.917
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:40.017 --> 48:42.653
Is not what you feel.
- Well, it's sad.

48:42.753 --> 48:47.768
Oh, yeah. I heard the wedding of two sides.
I've seen a lot.

48:48.292 --> 48:51.445
Both are not allowed to have their chances.

48:51.545 --> 48:54.435
I did not say that.
- But you said.

48:54.731 --> 48:57.196
No. At the time of my life...

48:57.273 --> 49:00.254
I know what I want and what I do not want
. Like you said.

49:00.354 --> 49:02.354
Have you been betrayed?

49:03.240 --> 49:04.842
Yes.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.942
More than once?

49:09.079 --> 49:11.445
And have you ever cheated?

49:13.116 --> 49:14.601
Yes.

49:14.701 --> 49:17.788
I did things in my life
that are not very commendable...

49:17.888 --> 49:19.373
And I'm not proud of it.

49:19.473 --> 49:23.383
But I also do not deny.
It was all in the past.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.461
It?
- Yes it is.

49:28.999 --> 49:30.999
Well, why do it?

49:31.835 --> 49:33.487
Why have I been unfaithful?

49:33.587 --> 49:36.974
I will not talk about it,
no longer matters.

49:37.074 --> 49:39.676
You learn from life and simply move on.

49:39.776 --> 49:41.595
I'm not sure that you followed.

49:41.695 --> 49:43.730
Can be as you see.

49:43.830 --> 49:47.718
It is your decision how much of my past
matter to you.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.793
There is nothing I can do about it.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.355
Are you worried about mine?

50:04.134 --> 50:07.433
Why not?
- Are behind you.

50:07.671 --> 50:10.857
I will not worry who you were.

50:10.957 --> 50:13.827
I'm wondering who you
is now sitting around this table.

50:13.927 --> 50:18.092
With you, it seems that nobody
really know anyone.

50:19.282 --> 50:22.615
Not completely, but I like it.

50:25.956 --> 50:28.241
I have not done
the best choices in my life...

50:28.341 --> 50:31.146
But I learned from those who did.

50:34.464 --> 50:36.464
I'm starting to see...

50:36.733 --> 50:39.720
That in his experience,
betray women...

50:39.820 --> 50:41.489
And things tend to go a certain way.

50:41.589 --> 50:45.309
So I think you should
know who you're dealing with now.

50:45.409 --> 50:48.628
I never cheated in my life,
it never occurred to me.

50:48.728 --> 50:50.330
I never will.

50:50.430 --> 50:52.449
When I'm in a good relationship...

50:52.549 --> 50:55.469
Is fully satisfactory and if I'm in a bad...

50:55.569 --> 50:59.606
I spend my energy trying to fix
, or trying cairfora.

50:59.706 --> 51:03.076
And frankly, I do not know
how anyone gets a case...

51:03.176 --> 51:05.212
Maybe I'm too selfish with my time...

51:05.312 --> 51:08.797
But I do not know if he had time for one.

51:14.838 --> 51:17.708
What is it? Do not believe me?
- I said nothing.

51:17.808 --> 51:19.476
Not needed.

51:19.576 --> 51:23.296
Listen, I can not be on Planet
so long as you...

51:23.396 --> 51:25.099
But have experienced my share of silly...

51:25.199 --> 51:27.934
And I'm not interested in a
relationship that involves it.

51:28.034 --> 51:30.670
I'll contartudo you want to know about me...

51:30.770 --> 51:34.541
Because lying is just another silly
and life is too short.

51:34.641 --> 51:36.176
You are an honorable woman.

51:36.276 --> 51:39.846
I know. Not everyone who
know me like me...

51:39.896 --> 51:42.282
But nobody can accuse me of
not to say things as they are...

51:42.382 --> 51:43.649
And if I quisertransar with someone else...

51:43.749 --> 51:45.586
I'll come and say that
not want anything more to you...

51:45.686 --> 51:49.086
And I'll go ahead with the I want to do.

51:50.006 --> 51:52.726
Not that I imagine it happening.

51:52.876 --> 51:57.180
God, I do not want to be with someone
do not want to be with me.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.832
Not afraid to be alone...

51:58.932 --> 52:01.868
And I prefer going through the
disappointment and rejection...

52:01.968 --> 52:03.738
And move on,
than being deceived...

52:03.838 --> 52:07.307
Because the disappointment is what
actually destroys the person.

52:07.407 --> 52:09.876
I can never stay with you...

52:09.976 --> 52:12.813
The break does not hurt
as much as the damage...

52:12.913 --> 52:15.899
Caused by the faith of a person
on their own judgment.

52:15.999 --> 52:17.999
I know.
- I'm leaving...

52:18.050 --> 52:20.050
Me too.

52:20.670 --> 52:23.571
Oh, my God.
- I will not be...

52:29.579 --> 52:34.034
As a Cowboy Made to be free.

52:34.134 --> 52:36.069
There is nothing that I do not.

52:36.169 --> 52:38.805
Not my way not me.

52:38.905 --> 52:41.141
I'll never forget.

52:41.241 --> 52:43.557
I know you moved.

52:43.760 --> 52:49.528
Like a cowboy walks alone What.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.102
Baby, continue.

52:55.038 --> 52:59.892
Like a cowboy Made to be free.

52:59.992 --> 53:01.862
There is nothing that I do not.

53:01.962 --> 53:03.962
Not my way not me.

53:04.030 --> 53:07.439
Oh, no.
- I'll never forget.

53:07.784 --> 53:12.189
It's not the guy What does the
...- Commercial Company Super Star.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.289
Know him?
- Yes.

53:14.340 --> 53:15.659
Andy.

53:15.759 --> 53:17.461
Hi, tree.

53:17.561 --> 53:19.995
I'll never forget.
- Andy...

53:20.163 --> 53:22.163
I know you went ahead.

53:22.256 --> 53:25.532
Hey, man of the mattress.
- Chris.

53:27.070 --> 53:29.070
Hey, man, how are you?

53:30.240 --> 53:34.594
You were born to wander through the land.

53:34.694 --> 53:35.695
Andy.

53:35.795 --> 53:40.512
My heart cries But I understand.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.717
Andy.

53:44.554 --> 53:47.182
Hi, Jude, what's cooking?

53:48.391 --> 53:50.825
Do not live here any more.

53:52.729 --> 53:55.789
You changed one month ago, remember?

53:57.534 --> 53:59.534
Oh, yeah.

54:03.340 --> 54:07.902
Well, it's good to see you guys.

54:10.013 --> 54:12.948
Like a cowboy.
- Andy.

54:13.516 --> 54:15.051
Yes, Jude.

54:15.151 --> 54:17.346
I think you should go.

54:18.188 --> 54:20.188
I will.

54:25.528 --> 54:27.528
Okay.

54:27.613 --> 54:29.929
Be careful, okay?

54:30.667 --> 54:32.667
Okay.

54:34.671 --> 54:39.574
Like a cowboy Made to be free.

54:46.716 --> 54:49.236
What?
- He's with the clothes...

54:49.336 --> 54:51.438
I'll masturbate, and relax...

54:51.538 --> 54:53.107
So no one sees why I'm dressed in a robe.

54:53.207 --> 54:55.442
I did not need to know.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.378
Well, I bet Celia not have one of these.

54:57.478 --> 54:59.478
She does not need one.

55:31.995 --> 55:35.282
You know, I think that the most important...

55:35.382 --> 55:37.083
Is know what you really want...

55:37.183 --> 55:39.903
And be honest about it,
so nobody gets confused.

55:40.003 --> 55:41.438
Yes.

55:41.538 --> 55:46.298
And knowing that you
all large, and falls into the music.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.061
Will get screwed.

55:48.161 --> 55:50.464
You know, you are very botininha
when he says 'will get screwed.'

55:50.564 --> 55:56.259
No, seriously, if you could have
anything in life, what would it be?

55:57.620 --> 56:00.156
I do not know, this is a big question.

56:00.256 --> 56:03.486
This is why have more than one answer.

56:03.993 --> 56:06.325
Has a list?
- Why not?

56:09.432 --> 56:11.384
Well, obviously I want to be writer.

56:11.484 --> 56:14.232
Writer you.
- A paid writer.

56:14.771 --> 56:16.423
If I could support myself...

56:16.523 --> 56:19.326
And so wanted to write, instead
to organize it around...

56:19.426 --> 56:21.745
My journey 14 hours of work, that
would be something beautiful.

56:21.845 --> 56:24.180
And the world would know his work.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.882
I think so.

56:25.982 --> 56:27.982
Do you?

56:28.067 --> 56:30.144
I know. I mean...

56:30.687 --> 56:34.240
I want to be successful and I want
people like my work...

56:34.340 --> 56:36.910
But I do not think it will be...

56:37.010 --> 56:40.088
Will give me more satisfaction.

56:40.730 --> 56:44.884
Financially, it will be.
And the sense of accomplishment...

56:44.984 --> 56:47.024
What is important to me.

56:47.170 --> 56:51.335
But I think the best part
will always be the case.

56:52.008 --> 56:56.502
Is always very difficult to get the 1st page.

56:56.813 --> 56:58.932
I usually not know what I'll do.

56:59.032 --> 57:05.505
And then, I only get this
place, where there a snap...

57:05.605 --> 57:07.607
And begins to flow from me...

57:07.707 --> 57:09.510
Like you're in my head all the time...

57:09.610 --> 57:11.077
And I have to put on paper once.

57:11.177 --> 57:14.619
And it's great.
It's amazing, actually.

57:15.031 --> 57:18.686
It's your Magic Hour.
- Yeah, I think it is.

57:20.403 --> 57:21.955
You can not feel what you do...

57:22.055 --> 57:23.691
When you put something on the page...

57:23.791 --> 57:25.358
But when we read his work...

57:25.458 --> 57:28.912
We experience
a thing exists only because of its process.

57:29.012 --> 57:31.981
And thus we are also touched.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.902
I like it, but I'd never sold anything.

57:36.002 --> 57:39.046
But it will.
- Someday.

57:39.556 --> 57:41.990
And what else?
- What else?

57:42.559 --> 57:45.295
You want something else, right?
- It is.

57:45.395 --> 57:47.829
E?
- What is it?

57:50.433 --> 57:52.819
I never made a list...
What was it?

57:52.919 --> 57:56.072
It's your list, how can I know?
- Well, I do not know.

57:56.172 --> 57:59.972
Of course you know, are typical.
- How?

58:00.176 --> 58:02.176
As a wedding.

58:02.979 --> 58:06.464
That for me may or may not be.
- Children?

58:07.016 --> 58:09.678
The same.
- The same?

58:10.453 --> 58:12.819
It is the same. What else?

58:13.656 --> 58:16.971
We could continue without having a son?

58:19.496 --> 58:22.260
I won without even trying.

58:26.536 --> 58:30.774
Yeah, I could go ahead without
a child, this surprise you?

58:30.874 --> 58:32.459
Yes, most women...

58:32.559 --> 58:34.327
I'm not most women.

58:34.427 --> 58:37.744
I see. Will change your mind?

58:38.181 --> 58:40.706
Maybe, maybe not.

58:41.584 --> 58:43.971
In the right situation, I can
imagine myself being a mother...

58:44.071 --> 58:46.539
But only under certain circumstances.

58:46.639 --> 58:48.639
You will have them.

58:49.392 --> 58:52.145
Oh, they?
Now I'll have more than one?

58:52.245 --> 58:53.730
Why not?

58:53.830 --> 58:57.995
First, because the hormones
surely make you crazy.

58:58.735 --> 59:02.432
And... And why...

59:03.439 --> 59:06.459
Because I did not wake up...

59:06.559 --> 59:08.329
A single morning in my life and thought...

59:08.429 --> 59:10.747
I'd really like to have a baby...

59:10.847 --> 59:13.366
And I've never been
with the son of a friend and thought...

59:13.466 --> 59:15.102
It would be great if I had one at home?

59:15.202 --> 59:17.202
Not once.

59:19.022 --> 59:22.442
Maybe my Biological Clock
has not started ticking yet.

59:22.542 --> 59:26.197
I may not have one, I do not know. Maybe...

59:26.896 --> 59:28.965
I wake up tomorrow and think...

59:29.065 --> 59:32.282
'Today is the Day,' and then go
the Sperm Bank.

59:32.382 --> 59:35.505
Or call you and you scared as hell and say:

59:35.605 --> 59:40.310
Hi, I want to have lunch with me and
maybe I then try to get pregnant?

59:40.410 --> 59:42.996
I do not know, anything can happen.

59:43.096 --> 59:48.848
But today, or now in this kitchen,
I'm not like 'Mom'.

59:49.619 --> 59:51.354
And...

59:51.454 --> 59:56.044
As any woman can think
children are the answer to life?

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.358
You know what?
You would be a great mom.

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:07.303
Well, I'm sure yes, but
that does not mean that I would be one.

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.739
And if it happened by accident?

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:13.159
I will not have an accident.
This is very old fashioned.

01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:14.527
Happen.

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:17.347
Not really believe that, do you?

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.633
Happens.
- Oh no, not true.

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:24.003
Women are 10 times more than the
manipulative of its kind...

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:29.288
And when we have accidents
is because we are behind something.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.588
Love, connection, security, money...

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.717
All these above.

01:00:37.817 --> 01:00:40.153
But I will say, there are no accidents...

01:00:40.253 --> 01:00:44.163
Misleading
there are only women and men stupid.

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:47.293
I'm sorry, but I take pill since high school...

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:49.811
And it's not complicated.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:54.407
You have children?
- Not that I know.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:57.579
Well, that's a fair answer.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.997
It is the only one I have.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.423
Do you want children?

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.256
I am good with children.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.317
Now I got you without even trying.

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:17.464
Yeah, got it.
- It is.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.818
Okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.158
Have you ever cheated?

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.310
I will not have this conversation, Shel.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.592
Sorry, I was just...
not know why I asked it.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.017
Well, because if I betray...

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:46.552
You will use this to justify
her own infidelity...

01:01:46.652 --> 01:01:52.942
And if I do not cheat, you will feel
the need to punish yourself even more.

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:58.581
You know, you never talk to
me about your relationship.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.450
No.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.550
Why?

01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:05.705
Well, for starters, you're
friend of Celia and furthermore...

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.508
I do not like to talk to anyone
about our relationship.

01:02:08.608 --> 01:02:11.498
Why? Do not think you should?
- No.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.031
Why?

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.450
Why is our relationship...

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:18.518
And have our own way of doing things.

01:02:18.618 --> 01:02:21.404
Because you're so confident and secure.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.623
You know, that's what I need Chris.

01:02:23.723 --> 01:02:25.725
No, that's what you need you.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.327
It's not why I'm the way I am, I mean...

01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:30.427
Everyone is different.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.400
You know, I'm glad helps you talk to me.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.952
I really am.

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:39.639
But in the end, the only two people
in your relationship...

01:02:39.739 --> 01:02:41.391
Are you and Chris.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:45.061
No matter what I say
or what anyone else thinks.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.246
You are the only people who really know...

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:52.361
What happens when the door closes
, and that's what matters.

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:56.359
So why know better than you two...

01:02:56.449 --> 01:02:59.424
I only see what you want me to see.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:04.274
In many ways, I am sure that
do not know actually.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.433
I hear would be a way for you to hear...

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.402
What you're thinking, aloud...

01:03:09.502 --> 01:03:12.817
So you can sort out what you querfazer.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:17.220
Like a relationship can be
simple if you let them.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.265
Thank you.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.584
You know, I'll always support you and Chris
...

01:03:24.684 --> 01:03:27.487
The decisions you make,
even though I like it or not.

01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:30.335
Unless a crazy with a knife.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:37.046
You are very good with that, I must confess
.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:42.416
No, I just do not let me go.
So it is easy to have perspective.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.730
Do you think I should tell him what I did?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.698
With that guy?
- It is.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:59.102
Well, is the man who wants to pursue?
- No.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.220
Well, Chris does some idea?

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.723
I mean, there is some distrust
or some weirdness...

01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:06.008
Hovering in the relationship?

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.108
No.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:13.379
He used a condom?
- Oh, my God, yes.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.536
Actually, he had a wallet...

01:04:16.636 --> 01:04:18.588
What I found very convenient.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.486
Men. Then clean?
- Yes.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.084
And this baby is not it?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.145
No.

01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:29.687
What would be the reason to tell Chris?

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:32.632
Be honest.
- Nonsense.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.387
What?

01:04:34.487 --> 01:04:36.455
You are always honest with him?

01:04:36.555 --> 01:04:41.033
Yes, very. I mean, that lie has silly, but...

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.829
This is not how to tell him...

01:04:42.929 --> 01:04:45.164
I bought my bag
settlement when they bought it.

01:04:45.264 --> 01:04:48.034
No, but...

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.304
Would be relieved to tell him?
- Yes.

01:04:51.404 --> 01:04:53.523
Quertirar it off your chest?

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:56.513
Yes, it has haunted me a year ago.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:05:00.733
And tell Chris make the relationship better?

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.851
Tell him you had sex with someone
a night...

01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:07.553
Shortly before becoming pregnant baby
him, for no particular reason...

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.922
Portesão only and you were working late.

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:11.991
This would help the
relationship you have now...

01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:14.641
To turn into something better?

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.316
So my punishment is having to live with it?

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:22.416
It.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.022
And there is no need to punish lo.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.657
No.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.543
And if he finds out, I mean,
it would be much worse.

01:05:30.643 --> 01:05:32.643
It would be humiliated.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:37.133
Well, what are the chances of that?
- I do not know.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:40.369
Well, it's been almost a year
and for those who told you?

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.469
You...

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:47.539
...just for me? Alright.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:55.293
You have to do what he thinks is the best
, Shel.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:00.439
But if you want the relationship
said he wants to...

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:03.793
I think you need stop living in the past...

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:08.823
And olhartodas the wonderful
things you have now, and soon.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:13.815
Listen,
'm not saying that what you did is correct.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:20.393
But everyone makes mistakes and
best thing you can do...

01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:23.383
Is learn from it and leave behind.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.146
Then you lie?

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.575
Everybody lies.

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:32.083
So what is your recipe?

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:36.256
For what?
- For the perfect relationship.

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.694
Oh, that.

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:43.849
1, I think the word 'Perfect' is a silly word...

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:46.868
Created by any writer ever.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:51.960
And I'm sure he was drunk and
disappointed when it did.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:58.407
E revenue relationship,
these are customized.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.367
Ingredients are measured per person...

01:07:01.467 --> 01:07:05.354
And then you have to figure
how to cook for yourself.

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:08.941
It's like cooking, is not it?
- It is just like cooking.

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.809
The quickest way to get
the heart of a man...

01:07:10.909 --> 01:07:13.596
Is through his stomach, and
that of a woman too.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.891
So what is your recipe?

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.399
My?

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:21.736
Or is it a secret?
- No.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:26.325
I would say are two shares of realism...

01:07:26.425 --> 01:07:31.540
A part honesty, part
of fun, and a part of love.

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.700
And a pinch of
be able to look the other way...

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.370
When is the best for the relationship.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.204
No one is perfect, Shel...

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:43.559
But you just have to figure out who
you want in the kitchen with you.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.162
Well, this is very to find out.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.262
Should be.

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:56.133
I travel a lot, but
kids travel well, and I'm not against it.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:58.305
Why are you laughing?

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:02.795
You have a baby.
- When it happens, it happens.

01:08:02.895 --> 01:08:04.531
If not, does not happen.
- Okay.

01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:06.866
It's not something I'm planning.

01:08:06.966 --> 01:08:11.404
No, no, it would take more responsibility
emotional and mental...

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.504
Than an accident.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.174
No.

01:08:15.274 --> 01:08:18.210
Okay, I'm just happy be responsible for...

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.779
Portomar the Pill...

01:08:19.879 --> 01:08:22.514
And believe me, I never forget.

01:08:22.573 --> 01:08:24.383
Do not look at me like that.

01:08:24.483 --> 01:08:27.219
We are having this conversation because
you want to know more about me...

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:30.804
Or because I want to
know more about you?

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.173
What are you talking?

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:37.350
Oh, I see.
- What do you understand?

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:41.300
What you are well aware that
is in control of this conversation...

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:45.187
And will stay that way
until I call you directly.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.287
Okay.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.857
Okay, what?

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:55.024
You're worried, you have something
what you mean, what is it?

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.701
None.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:12.479
Okay, what you want from life?

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.701
I have everything I need life.

01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:19.653
'Want'. Whatever a relationship?

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.741
What I want this relationship?

01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:26.828
In any relationship.
What do you think is important?

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.929
Take advantage of lo.

01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:33.966
This is obvious.

01:09:34.035 --> 01:09:37.656
Well, it would be, but I think it is
forgotten most of the time.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.756
After a while.

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.394
I am very happy with my life...

01:09:42.493 --> 01:09:45.163
And I am very happy to accept
it the way it comes.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.332
How can do this with so many rules?

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.301
Rules? I do not have rules.
- Oh, no?

01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:52.402
I have no actually.

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:55.024
Open to all, but committed to anything.

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:58.461
It has to do with commitment
commitment or not.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.212
It's about being involved...

01:10:00.312 --> 01:10:02.715
What you think which can be anything...

01:10:02.815 --> 01:10:05.317
Instead of
enjoy what it is and let that feeling...

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:08.131
Take you where you want to go.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.709
This is a rule.
- This is freedom.

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:15.628
Course. If you like handcuffs
with his freedom, I think it is.

01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:17.129
No.
- Yes.

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:19.238
Why?
- Because...

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:24.937
In your quest to be open,
you say 'No' to many things...

01:10:25.037 --> 01:10:27.206
Before know what are the things you want.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.807
I know what I want.

01:10:28.907 --> 01:10:32.027
Because of the experiences
they had in the past?

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:33.078
Yes.

01:10:33.178 --> 01:10:35.548
Okay. Not limiting their own freedom...

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:39.133
If not explore new opportunities through?

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:42.671
You know, you is a very good writer.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.323
I'm good devil's advocate.

01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:46.859
Ah, that too. You could have been a lawyer.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:49.275
I know. But, really...

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.884
What do you think is more important
in a relationship?

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.619
It depends on the relationship.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:01.340
It may sound simple, but a
simple relationship...

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.576
Between two people...

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.729
May be the best and hardest thing to do.

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:09.131
Relationships are not simple.

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:12.518
No. But enjoying life with your partner...

01:11:12.618 --> 01:11:14.763
Can be if you let it.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.958
It's making me all these questions
because you want an answer...

01:11:19.058 --> 01:11:21.704
Or he has something to say?

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:31.645
Okay.
What is more important to you?

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.175
Honesty.

01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:38.523
Mutual respect.

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.857
And similar taste in music.

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:47.123
Music?
- Yes, it is very important.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.388
Okay.

01:11:49.488 --> 01:11:53.158
Been with someone who has a
completely different musical tastes?

01:11:53.258 --> 01:11:55.411
I think not, actually.
- See?

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.721
I see nothing, except you.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.683
For you, this has been a problem.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.201
Absolutely.

01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:06.466
And the relationship was not well?
- No. Not good.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:10.726
A week and a half together, he put a
Techno CD in the car.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:15.598
Io I should have dropped right there.
Nobody listens to techno.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:17.698
Do not have a soul.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.128
For you, no soul in Techno.

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:24.290
To others, it defines soul.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.559
I know, has a multitude
you could argue that...

01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:30.512
And they could all go out
with each other. Not me.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.864
Do you like Techno?

01:12:31.964 --> 01:12:36.068
No, but if I liked,
not we having fun yet?

01:12:36.168 --> 01:12:38.609
No. Not for long.

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:43.442
Okay, complementary differences
enhance a relationship.

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:45.752
Differences conflicting...

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:49.381
Lead to commitments reluctant.

01:12:49.481 --> 01:12:52.401
It's just a matter of time
before the ship sink.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:56.666
E... difference is
musical 'Reluctant Compromise.'

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.657
Sure, I know.

01:12:58.757 --> 01:13:01.994
Do not look like much, that's why I got
'Mr Techno'.

01:13:02.094 --> 01:13:05.164
But if you think about all the times that
listening to music during the day...

01:13:05.264 --> 01:13:08.000
And then you think
half that time or even more...

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.650
Is the music that you dislike.

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.040
How about someone who
does not hear music?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.558
Oh, no. No.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:21.547
Sorry, there are some obstacles in the lane
lovers.

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.647
Alameda lovers?

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:27.759
Been in love?
- Yes, of course, and you?

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.188
Yes, many times.

01:13:29.288 --> 01:13:33.425
But for you, now I think
which is a very broad question.

01:13:33.525 --> 01:13:36.171
What do you mean by love?

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.697
Well, love...

01:13:38.797 --> 01:13:40.366
Love, how?

01:13:40.466 --> 01:13:44.910
Love in its essence,
love with everything you do.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:49.212
That's it, that's the whole definition?
- Yes.

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.894
I loved...

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.398
But not always matter how much you love.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:02.087
What does this mean?

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:06.597
Mean it does not always work.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:22.274
Have you been heartbroken?
- Oh, long ago, and you?

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:26.753
Not exactly.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.808
I mean, I have loved enough...

01:15:29.908 --> 01:15:33.308
But I do not think I committed enough...

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:37.049
To experience a heart
broken, I do not think so.

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:39.001
Why not?

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.587
No conscious reason,
I just always went out with guys...

01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:44.490
With whom knew not want to stay forever...

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.509
Then when we finished up, it was good...

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:50.669
And I was not so sad,
except myself.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.050
Portomar a bad decision?

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.804
What seemed to be the right
decision at the moment?

01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:04.560
It.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.788
So may not have been a bad decision.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.648
I do not know.

01:16:09.748 --> 01:16:13.078
You know, sometimes bad
decisions are taken...

01:16:13.178 --> 01:16:14.303
...for good reason.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.973
Sometimes, but I did
more than a few times.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.832
But okay, now it's over.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.980
And found love again?
- Of course, and you?

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.814
Yes I have.

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.669
Sairfora could love?

01:16:30.769 --> 01:16:33.415
Sure, anyone can sairfora love.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:37.459
Do you think you have some time
limit for this?

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:42.319
I think the duration is different
for different people...

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.918
But I do not think that love
is the most important part...

01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:47.018
A relationship.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.926
I love him, you know?
- I know.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:20.235
I can not imagine life without him
. It would be so much fun.

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:23.372
Well, it looks like you made
the right choices then.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.202
Yeah, except for one.

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.276
What?

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:34.283
Have you noticed that the best
conversations happen in the kitchen?

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:38.548
Ah, the satisfaction is the place
and distraction.

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.692
Heart problem,
heart of the house.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:44.316
I love these guys.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.019
Cannoli.
- Cannoli.

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:50.060
Fat and sugar.
- Thank God.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:53.334
Know what would be best?
- What?

01:17:53.426 --> 01:17:55.426
A lover in bed.

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:04.611
So, will give him.

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.281
Okay.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.949
In more ways than one.

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.254
Passion?

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:19.670
It's amazing, but this
comes and goes, is not it?

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:23.016
I do not believe
would be willing to live your life...

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:25.384
With someone was not in love.

01:18:25.484 --> 01:18:28.270
I will not say that love is not a factor.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.656
We love people with whom we spend time...

01:18:30.756 --> 01:18:31.658
One way or another.

01:18:31.758 --> 01:18:34.159
Otherwise, you will not
spend time with them.

01:18:34.259 --> 01:18:37.329
But being in love, being in that
Rollercoaster...

01:18:37.429 --> 01:18:39.214
What people want so much...

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:44.286
This is a different kind of love,
and that kind of amortermina.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.138
Sometimes, perhaps.

01:18:46.238 --> 01:18:49.157
No, I think always,
all the time.

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.986
No, you can have two.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.913
There is nothing wrong with that, but...

01:18:54.013 --> 01:18:57.165
Ride a Rollercoaster not last 50 years.

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:59.835
There are other things to do... Many other.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.486
What things?

01:19:01.586 --> 01:19:05.131
Type companionship, good conversation...

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:09.573
Laugh, caring, understanding...

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:13.842
Consistency, confidence.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.759
This does not seem so bad.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:20.188
I think it looks good, in fact.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.668
I'll have to agree with you.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.949
What about tomorrow?

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.154
Tomorrow?

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:56.249
Vai feel the same thing
about all this tomorrow?

01:19:57.192 --> 01:20:01.094
Maybe, maybe not. And you?

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.028
I do not know. But...

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.929
I have a request.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:11.128
What is it?
- Do not break my heart.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.645
I never want to break your heart.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.811
Good, because you can.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.762
St. 2:30 am.
- Oh, no. Bed.

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.938
Bed.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:12.604
'Between Wine & Lovers'...

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.767
Is a good name for a story.

01:24:15.867 --> 01:24:18.285
It?
- Should write it.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.387
Okay. And it would be about?

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:25.797
Oh, I do not know.
You will create something.

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:30.582
The Moon in the sky fills
His eyes like a big pizza.

01:24:30.682 --> 01:24:32.417
It is love...

01:24:32.517 --> 01:24:34.517
...love is.

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:37.771
Like this music?
- Taste.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:42.001
Well, we have a chance then.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.663
Bells will ring Ting-a-ling-a-ling,
ting-a-ling-a-ling.

01:24:45.763 --> 01:24:46.965
And you will sing...

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:49.381
...bella Vita - Vita bella.

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:52.837
The Moon in the sky Fill your eyes.

01:24:52.937 --> 01:24:55.412
Like a big pizza And love...
