00:00.025 --> 00:02.687
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

00:02.828 --> 00:04.125
Move out!

00:06.932 --> 00:08.991
Captain Steele. Captain Steele, come in.

00:10.903 --> 00:12.928
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

00:13.172 --> 00:17.802
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

00:18.043 --> 00:19.772
We need a medivac over here now!

00:20.312 --> 00:25.272
25 is telling me it's too hot to land a bird.
You gotta secure the perimeter first. Over.

00:26.285 --> 00:27.479
Where are the humvees?

00:27.553 --> 00:30.522
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

00:30.689 --> 00:33.817
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

00:45.904 --> 00:49.601
- Get the 50 up!
- You should see the crash directly ahead.

00:49.775 --> 00:51.572
All I see is a roadblock!

00:53.378 --> 00:55.938
All right, I'll have to figure out another way.

01:21.106 --> 01:24.132
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.258
Fire your weapon, Othic!

01:58.243 --> 02:01.041
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

02:07.119 --> 02:08.108
Othic!

02:10.856 --> 02:12.016
Medic!

02:13.125 --> 02:14.319
Hoo-ah!

02:43.155 --> 02:45.350
Medic! Medic!

02:45.757 --> 02:49.454
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

02:51.063 --> 02:55.124
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.431
Keep going straight 200 meters.

02:59.204 --> 03:00.330
Roger that.

03:01.907 --> 03:03.204
Let's go!

03:03.675 --> 03:05.666
Let's go, God damn it, let's go!

03:23.895 --> 03:26.090
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

03:30.702 --> 03:32.863
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

03:33.638 --> 03:34.730
What?

03:36.108 --> 03:38.076
Were we supposed to go to them?

03:38.143 --> 03:40.236
I thought they were supposed
to come to us.

03:40.312 --> 03:41.404
Shit.

03:42.481 --> 03:45.006
- I think we're supposed to go to them.
- Shit.

03:46.385 --> 03:49.479
Okay, let's go to the crash site.

03:49.988 --> 03:50.977
Okay.

03:51.056 --> 03:54.583
Just don't fire that thing so close
to my head. I can barely hear as it is.

03:54.659 --> 03:55.887
Okay, move out.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.264
Shit! Get down!

04:12.511 --> 04:15.605
What did I just tell you?
I swear to God if you do that again...

04:15.680 --> 04:16.668
Shut up!

04:20.285 --> 04:22.310
You okay? Nelson.

04:22.754 --> 04:23.982
You all right?

04:24.055 --> 04:25.044
What?

04:25.590 --> 04:28.991
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

04:40.439 --> 04:41.428
Go!

04:46.244 --> 04:47.734
Go, go!

04:50.015 --> 04:53.678
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

04:53.752 --> 04:57.347
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.788
- Advise you to come out now.
- Roger.

04:59.858 --> 05:01.325
Dropping last man.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.922
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs
at 12 o'clock. Can you see them?

05:07.999 --> 05:09.864
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

05:20.679 --> 05:21.976
68 coming out.

05:23.882 --> 05:25.975
Super 68 is out. Over.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.924
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

05:39.064 --> 05:40.895
Both pilots are dead.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.668
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

05:45.003 --> 05:46.971
We'll kill them just carrying them.

05:47.038 --> 05:49.063
- Stabilize in here?
- Roger.

05:49.674 --> 05:52.802
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

05:52.911 --> 05:55.038
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

05:55.113 --> 05:58.674
Super 64, come inbound
and take Wolcott's position.

05:59.518 --> 06:01.986
Roger. 64 is inbound.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.606
Super 64, you all right?

06:30.682 --> 06:33.480
This is Super 64. We're good.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.449
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

06:36.788 --> 06:38.779
Instrument panels are okay.

06:39.057 --> 06:43.153
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

06:43.728 --> 06:47.755
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

06:48.567 --> 06:49.556
Roger.

06:52.237 --> 06:56.674
I'm getting a lot of movement
in these pedals. Check the systems again.

07:11.823 --> 07:14.189
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

07:14.259 --> 07:15.886
64 is going down!

07:17.329 --> 07:19.092
64 is going in hard.

07:20.465 --> 07:21.955
64 going down.

07:27.038 --> 07:28.699
We're going down.

07:33.945 --> 07:35.845
Get Struecker's column back out there.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.212
They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.116
- Got another bird down.
- I want them out of there.

07:41.553 --> 07:42.747
All of them.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.552
Super 64 is out.

07:45.624 --> 07:46.716
What?

07:52.697 --> 07:54.688
They talking about another Hawk?

08:00.839 --> 08:04.172
Captain Steele, we got to move
or we're gonna get pinned down!

08:04.242 --> 08:06.267
We're moving just as fast as we can.

08:06.344 --> 08:09.507
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

08:17.255 --> 08:20.190
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Ruiz, stay down.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.657
- I fucking knew...
- Medic.

08:21.726 --> 08:25.719
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.095
We'll rally point the gray building.
Coming through, Captain.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.155
Sarg'nt!

08:29.234 --> 08:30.292
All right, let's move!

08:30.368 --> 08:32.302
- Let's move! Now!
- Move! Move!

08:35.940 --> 08:37.236
Cover me!

08:43.248 --> 08:45.682
- Let's go, let's move!
- Moving out.

08:51.623 --> 08:52.612
Friendly!

08:52.691 --> 08:54.124
Friendlies coming through!

08:54.192 --> 08:56.387
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

08:56.494 --> 08:58.394
Come on, come on!

08:58.830 --> 08:59.854
Come on!

09:07.739 --> 09:09.764
Move up! Go! Move up!

09:09.841 --> 09:11.468
What the fuck are you doing out there?

09:11.543 --> 09:14.478
I'm doing my job!
Now we got to get to that crash site!

09:14.546 --> 09:17.140
We got to get out on that street,
and we got to move!

09:17.916 --> 09:20.009
And you have got to keep up, sir!

09:20.118 --> 09:22.279
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.151
We are combat ineffective,
you understand me?

09:25.290 --> 09:27.019
We got too many dang wounded to move!

09:27.092 --> 09:30.687
Then give me some of your shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.522
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

09:35.700 --> 09:36.724
Yes, sir!

09:36.935 --> 09:40.371
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

09:40.939 --> 09:43.203
The rest of you men, secure this position!

09:43.274 --> 09:45.504
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

09:45.577 --> 09:48.045
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

09:48.313 --> 09:49.712
Come on, guys, let's go!

10:20.745 --> 10:23.839
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

10:23.915 --> 10:26.611
volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.

10:27.152 --> 10:31.555
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

10:33.158 --> 10:37.219
We don't see anything moving down there
now, we don't even know if anyone's alive.

10:38.363 --> 10:41.093
A ground team is being organized
to go in now.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.895
ETA on ground team? Over.

10:43.168 --> 10:45.796
Unknown, not long.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.337
Do what you can from the air.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.540
All right, gather around!

10:54.679 --> 10:57.944
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

10:58.016 --> 11:00.109
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive on that?

11:00.185 --> 11:02.745
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.
You know that.

11:02.821 --> 11:05.016
- We're wasting time here.
- All right.

11:05.190 --> 11:08.216
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

11:09.394 --> 11:11.419
Sizemore, where the hell
do you think you're going?

11:11.496 --> 11:14.329
- With you guys.
- Not with that cast on you're not.

11:15.066 --> 11:18.331
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.832
Talk to me.

11:22.006 --> 11:23.735
I can't go back out there.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.268
Thomas, everyone feels
the same way you do. All right?

11:28.346 --> 11:31.611
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

11:32.584 --> 11:33.881
It's your call.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.713
Hoo-ah?

11:41.759 --> 11:42.987
Hoo-ah.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.472
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

12:11.956 --> 12:13.890
Sergeant Struecker!

12:14.559 --> 12:18.256
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

12:18.329 --> 12:20.422
- You got some ammo?
- Roger that, Sarge!

12:20.498 --> 12:21.692
Hop in!

12:40.018 --> 12:41.110
Wait!

12:42.487 --> 12:44.250
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

13:03.808 --> 13:05.799
Nelson, Twombly, come in.
This is Galentine.

13:05.877 --> 13:07.868
We need to position the convoy. Over.

13:08.179 --> 13:10.670
Nelson, Twombly, come in.
This is Galentine. Over.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.737
What?

13:12.884 --> 13:15.182
- You said something. What?
- What?

13:16.554 --> 13:17.543
Fine.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.720
I can't raise him, Sergeant, I can't raise him.

13:21.793 --> 13:23.988
Sergeant, let's get the fuck out of here
and evac.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.258
- Let's move out.
- All right!

13:27.332 --> 13:28.924
Back to the stronghold!

13:29.400 --> 13:30.389
Come on.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.801
Which way?

13:42.814 --> 13:45.806
- That way, I think!
- Not so fucking loud.

14:19.584 --> 14:20.983
Nice donkey.

14:39.303 --> 14:40.531
Rangers?

14:41.272 --> 14:42.330
Who?

14:43.107 --> 14:46.042
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

14:46.978 --> 14:48.070
Fuck!

14:48.479 --> 14:50.970
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

14:51.115 --> 14:53.879
- Come to us!
- Fuck you, come to me.

15:06.798 --> 15:08.129
Sorry, Sarge!

15:08.199 --> 15:10.394
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

15:10.468 --> 15:12.333
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

15:12.403 --> 15:14.667
No, I didn't bring it,
and you want to know why?

15:14.739 --> 15:18.004
Because you said: "You're not gonna need
that, dude, we'll be back in a half-hour."

15:18.076 --> 15:19.634
No, I wasn't saying it to you.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.701
Nelson, cover this way.

15:22.146 --> 15:23.670
Man, we're gonna need night vision.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.579
What's the matter with you?

15:26.584 --> 15:28.643
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.784
- We need to get out of here!
- That way.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.025
We can't be far from the crash. Which way?

15:36.227 --> 15:38.218
I thought you might know.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.253
Let's move out.

15:49.674 --> 15:52.905
Ground forces have occupied
several buildings along Marehan Road...

15:52.977 --> 15:54.672
but they're all spread out.

15:54.745 --> 15:59.307
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site here.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.749
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

16:02.019 --> 16:06.046
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

16:06.124 --> 16:07.648
They're banged up pretty bad.

16:07.725 --> 16:12.219
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they're gonna be able to move.

16:12.897 --> 16:15.331
Sergeant Sanderson
and a small Delta team...

16:15.399 --> 16:19.358
are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.441
Draw off fire!

16:31.516 --> 16:34.576
When this asshole stops to reload,
cover me!

16:34.685 --> 16:35.947
- Go!
- Sir.

16:39.724 --> 16:40.713
Again!

16:45.596 --> 16:46.824
Loading!

16:49.634 --> 16:51.261
Keep going! Keep going!

16:51.769 --> 16:53.134
I'm jammed!

16:54.639 --> 16:56.106
I got it!

16:57.408 --> 16:58.841
No, shit!

17:11.756 --> 17:13.155
RPG!

17:27.972 --> 17:30.532
You all right? You okay?

17:30.708 --> 17:33.677
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

17:35.279 --> 17:36.906
Come on! Come on!

17:39.250 --> 17:40.217
Go!

17:47.458 --> 17:50.393
There's a crowd advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

17:50.461 --> 17:52.827
Shughart and Gordon
again request permission...

17:52.897 --> 17:55.832
to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.594
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

17:59.837 --> 18:03.295
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

18:03.407 --> 18:05.307
They know what they're asking.

18:05.509 --> 18:06.976
Let me talk to them.

18:07.178 --> 18:08.270
This is Garrison.

18:08.346 --> 18:11.042
I want to make sure that y'all understand
what you're asking for...

18:11.115 --> 18:13.083
so say it out loud and clear.

18:14.685 --> 18:18.485
We're asking to go in and set up
a perimeter until ground support arrives.

18:19.123 --> 18:23.287
And you realize that I cannot tell you
when that might be, it could take a while.

18:24.095 --> 18:26.461
- Roger that.
- You still want to go in there?

18:26.731 --> 18:27.755
Yes, sir.

18:31.769 --> 18:33.430
- Colonel Harrell?
- Yes, General?

18:33.504 --> 18:34.562
It's your call.

18:35.706 --> 18:37.071
Roger that.

18:38.976 --> 18:40.841
Goffena, put them in.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.855
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.091
RPG!

19:13.044 --> 19:14.978
Set up your perimeter!

19:21.952 --> 19:23.943
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

19:24.021 --> 19:28.014
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

19:29.193 --> 19:30.683
Son of a bitch.

19:32.530 --> 19:35.693
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy!

19:36.067 --> 19:40.231
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

19:40.771 --> 19:42.261
Get in that truck and drive.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.035
- But I'm shot, Colonel.
- Everybody's shot.

19:44.108 --> 19:46.099
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

19:47.278 --> 19:50.441
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

19:51.015 --> 19:55.281
McKnight, we need you to turn around
and head back to Hawlwadig.

19:55.453 --> 19:57.921
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

19:57.988 --> 19:59.683
There's gotta be a better route!

19:59.757 --> 20:04.751
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

20:06.063 --> 20:07.928
Roger that. Roger that.

20:08.566 --> 20:11.228
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

20:11.302 --> 20:13.532
They're trying to get us all fucking killed,
aren't they, sir?

20:13.604 --> 20:15.162
Just get it over with! Drive!

20:15.239 --> 20:16.399
God damn!

20:16.474 --> 20:18.806
Get us out of here, God damn it, drive!

20:26.217 --> 20:27.946
Keep your foot on the gas!

20:28.018 --> 20:30.043
Keep your foot on the gas!

20:53.911 --> 20:54.969
Fuck!

20:57.915 --> 20:58.904
Shit.

21:14.365 --> 21:17.266
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

21:17.334 --> 21:18.494
Roger.

21:44.395 --> 21:45.760
Friendlies!

21:48.132 --> 21:49.531
God, it's good to see you!

21:49.600 --> 21:51.397
It's good to see you. How bad?

21:51.469 --> 21:54.597
My leg's broken
and my back feels kind of weird.

21:54.672 --> 21:57.038
We've got to get you out of here, buddy.

21:57.641 --> 21:59.472
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

22:02.880 --> 22:03.869
Wait, I...

22:12.356 --> 22:13.687
I'm putting you down.

22:13.757 --> 22:16.089
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.184
Roger that.

22:17.261 --> 22:18.455
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

22:18.529 --> 22:20.053
You're locked and loaded.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.361
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

22:23.434 --> 22:26.096
- Where's the rescue squad?
- We're it.

22:32.743 --> 22:35.439
C-2, you keep talking about the convoy.

22:35.579 --> 22:38.446
I'd like to know where in hell it is. Over.

22:38.516 --> 22:41.076
The perimeter has to be tighter
for the convoy.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.051
You're too far from the crash.

22:43.254 --> 22:46.690
Stay spread out like that
and you're all liable to be overrun.

22:46.891 --> 22:49.655
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.462
Son of a bitch.

22:52.563 --> 22:55.430
Romeo 64, we're right back
where we started.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.499
I'm running low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

22:58.569 --> 23:00.400
vehicles that are barely running.

23:00.471 --> 23:03.770
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-b.s. Assessment here.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.968
Can you get to the crash site?

23:06.844 --> 23:09.108
Colonel, I can't see shit.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.274
Negative.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.218
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

23:17.288 --> 23:21.452
We need to come back to base, rearm
and regroup and then we can go back out.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.514
Roger.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.797
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

23:29.266 --> 23:30.858
Roger. Return to base.

23:31.569 --> 23:32.934
We're going home!

23:33.170 --> 23:34.797
Let's go. Left.

23:48.052 --> 23:51.249
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.585
- What's up?
- They're sending them back.

23:58.662 --> 24:00.425
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

24:00.497 --> 24:02.658
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

24:03.133 --> 24:07.263
We need to exfil the wounded now and get
the hell out of here before it's too late!

24:07.338 --> 24:10.865
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.708
It changes nothing.

24:12.776 --> 24:13.868
All right, listen up.

24:13.944 --> 24:16.845
We're going to hold the perimeter
and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.541
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.

24:19.149 --> 24:21.982
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

24:24.221 --> 24:26.018
The convoy is going to come.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.758
We're going to get home.

24:40.904 --> 24:41.893
Loading!

24:50.381 --> 24:51.609
Loading!

24:52.182 --> 24:53.945
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

25:07.431 --> 25:08.523
Loading!

25:12.169 --> 25:13.568
Randy, last mag!

25:17.074 --> 25:18.234
Gordy!

25:21.845 --> 25:22.937
Fuck!

25:36.326 --> 25:38.521
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

25:39.096 --> 25:40.222
Good luck.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.558
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

26:10.627 --> 26:13.755
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

26:14.098 --> 26:15.793
They don't know we've gone in.

26:15.866 --> 26:20.303
Look, we have stirred up the hornet's nest
here. We're fighting the entire city.

26:20.704 --> 26:25.368
I want every vehicle possible that's got
4 wheels and armor. Get it. Get everything.

26:25.476 --> 26:28.877
Now, once they've assembled, we're gonna
move our men out of the hostile area...

26:28.946 --> 26:31.540
and back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

26:31.615 --> 26:34.015
- Now, let's go.
- Roger that, boss.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.434
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

29:18.282 --> 29:22.651
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

29:26.690 --> 29:29.750
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

29:29.826 --> 29:33.353
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.623
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

29:37.034 --> 29:39.332
Negative. You don't understand.

29:39.403 --> 29:43.931
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

29:44.308 --> 29:47.937
There ain't one. The only other route is
all the way around the city.

29:48.011 --> 29:49.103
Roger that.

29:49.179 --> 29:51.909
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

29:51.982 --> 29:56.442
Request permission to move
to crash site number two on foot. Over.

29:57.287 --> 29:59.312
Green light, Kilo 11.

29:59.389 --> 30:01.789
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

31:03.754 --> 31:05.881
- What?
- Don't you hear that?

31:06.456 --> 31:09.448
- Is it the convoy?
- No. No, it's not the convoy.

31:16.433 --> 31:20.028
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

31:20.103 --> 31:22.970
The usual. Blended, no salt.

31:28.211 --> 31:31.408
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

31:44.928 --> 31:46.657
Eversmann, come in.

31:46.897 --> 31:48.228
Eversmann.

31:50.434 --> 31:52.766
- Roger, who is this?
- Sanderson.

31:52.836 --> 31:57.432
Do not... I say again, do not fire to the east.
We are coming to you.

31:58.809 --> 31:59.935
Understood.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.644
DiTomasso and his men
are on the southeast corner.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.078
We need you on the northeast building.

32:05.148 --> 32:06.775
Roger. We'll take it.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.447
Watch out for skinnies.
They're all over the rooftops.

32:09.519 --> 32:11.987
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

32:15.492 --> 32:17.289
Hold your fire to the east.

32:39.382 --> 32:41.077
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

32:41.451 --> 32:43.851
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

32:44.254 --> 32:47.018
We got the chopper in sight. Where are you?

32:47.124 --> 32:48.318
We're on the southwest corner.

32:48.391 --> 32:50.256
Where the hell have you been?
Are you okay?

32:50.327 --> 32:51.316
Yeah.

32:52.829 --> 32:54.820
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

32:59.836 --> 33:00.894
We got to go.

33:00.971 --> 33:03.872
Shawn! Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.100
When he gets across the street...

33:05.175 --> 33:08.042
he's gonna turn around
and he's gonna cover you as you run.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.806
Listen closely. When you get there...

33:09.880 --> 33:13.077
you're gonna turn around
and you're gonna cover me, okay?

33:13.884 --> 33:16.216
You're not gonna just run
to Eversmann's position.

33:16.286 --> 33:19.278
You're gonna stop, you're gonna
turn around and you are gonna cover me.

33:19.356 --> 33:21.517
It's important you understand that.

33:22.058 --> 33:23.423
Okay, you ready?

33:24.427 --> 33:25.792
Yeah, I guess.

33:31.368 --> 33:32.926
- Don't forget.
- What?

33:33.470 --> 33:34.698
Don't forget.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.716
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

33:51.788 --> 33:52.914
I see them.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.156
Let's move out.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.259
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

34:01.464 --> 34:02.795
We got you.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.232
Nelson!

34:18.348 --> 34:19.440
Fuck!

34:28.158 --> 34:29.147
Twombly!

34:30.659 --> 34:31.786
Smith! No!

34:31.928 --> 34:33.190
You all right?

34:36.533 --> 34:37.898
Get it off of me!

34:38.668 --> 34:40.067
Get it off!

34:41.371 --> 34:42.998
Come on, man. Come on.

34:44.174 --> 34:47.109
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

34:55.518 --> 34:56.815
My leg! My leg!

34:56.886 --> 34:58.581
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

35:05.662 --> 35:07.687
Up, one, two, three.

35:09.032 --> 35:11.694
- You're all right.
- I need pressure on this wound.

35:11.768 --> 35:12.826
My right thigh!

35:12.902 --> 35:14.597
Pressure, yeah.

35:14.771 --> 35:17.103
- Are my balls okay?
- You still have your balls.

35:17.173 --> 35:18.640
I need more men in here.

35:18.708 --> 35:20.903
Twombly! Nelson!

35:20.977 --> 35:23.912
- Put him down.
- Oh, man, that really...

35:23.980 --> 35:25.345
I need that chair.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.645
- It really hurts!
- Direct pressure on that.

35:27.717 --> 35:29.207
It's okay, it's okay.

35:29.786 --> 35:32.152
- Let me see it!
- All right.

35:32.622 --> 35:34.886
All right, let me get a look at that.

35:35.292 --> 35:36.691
Oh, shit!

35:36.893 --> 35:38.121
Oh, fuck!

35:38.328 --> 35:40.728
- What the fuck was that?
- It's all right.

35:40.797 --> 35:42.958
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

35:43.033 --> 35:44.432
Fuck. Galentine!

35:44.534 --> 35:45.626
It's all right.

35:45.702 --> 35:47.761
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

35:48.438 --> 35:51.464
- Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
- Juliet 64, come in. Over.

35:51.541 --> 35:55.375
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

35:55.445 --> 35:58.505
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus for me.

35:58.581 --> 36:01.141
- All right? Can you do that?
- Juliet 64, come in. Over.

36:01.217 --> 36:03.117
Now, can you hold your weapon?

36:03.720 --> 36:04.709
Yes, sir.

36:04.821 --> 36:06.254
Anybody comes through that door...

36:06.323 --> 36:08.883
you give him two in the chest
and one in the head.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.359
- You understand?
- I'm still in the fight, sir.

36:12.662 --> 36:15.722
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

36:15.799 --> 36:18.290
- Corporal Smith has been hit!
- Hold on, 25.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.068
Still in the fight.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.603
Captain Steele, he's hurt pretty bad.

36:21.671 --> 36:25.607
25, we got wounded, too. You're just gonna
have to maintain your situation, over.

36:25.675 --> 36:28.235
If he doesn't get to a hospital in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

36:28.745 --> 36:30.372
C-2, this is 64.

36:30.613 --> 36:32.581
I'm requesting an immediate medivac...

36:32.649 --> 36:35.447
for a critically wounded
at Chalk Four's location. Over.

36:35.518 --> 36:38.385
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.820
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

36:41.291 --> 36:46.160
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

36:46.496 --> 36:50.455
25, this is 64. It's a negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

36:50.533 --> 36:54.299
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You're just gonna have to hold on.

37:00.877 --> 37:02.310
All right. I got him.

37:02.379 --> 37:04.813
I want direct pressure on the wound.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.151
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be okay.

37:53.062 --> 37:56.327
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.798
Roger that.

38:19.622 --> 38:21.817
Crash site two secured.

38:21.891 --> 38:24.223
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

38:24.461 --> 38:25.485
Cribbs?

38:25.795 --> 38:29.060
- Sir, they're still debating the route.
- How long?

38:29.799 --> 38:31.426
At least a couple of hours.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.262
We haven't got that long, Joe.

38:33.336 --> 38:37.932
Pakistani General says, since
we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

38:38.041 --> 38:41.977
it's gonna take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

38:42.045 --> 38:44.036
You tell the general this:

38:44.247 --> 38:47.410
I understand,
but it is my duty to remind him...

38:47.484 --> 38:51.147
that my men are surrounded
by thousands of armed Somali militia.

38:51.421 --> 38:56.415
It is imperative that we move them out
of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

38:57.093 --> 38:58.617
I need his help now.

38:59.629 --> 39:00.857
Yes, sir.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.197
Durant.

39:07.904 --> 39:09.838
Michael Durant.

39:11.107 --> 39:12.165
Yes.

39:12.408 --> 39:14.808
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

39:15.178 --> 39:18.409
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

39:22.519 --> 39:23.986
That's right.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.012
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.560
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.258
What do you want with me?

39:39.636 --> 39:41.604
You have taken hostages.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.171
We have you.

39:44.407 --> 39:47.240
My government will never negotiate for me.

39:48.177 --> 39:52.546
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

39:54.284 --> 39:56.115
Soldier to soldier.

40:02.926 --> 40:04.587
I'm not in charge.

40:07.730 --> 40:11.564
Of course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

40:12.669 --> 40:15.797
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

40:17.140 --> 40:20.337
Do you really think
if you get General Aidid...

40:20.843 --> 40:23.505
we will simply put down our weapons...

40:24.280 --> 40:26.578
and adopt American democracy?

40:27.684 --> 40:29.777
That the killing will stop?

40:29.919 --> 40:33.980
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.352
There will always be killing, you see?

40:37.727 --> 40:40.287
This is how things are in our world.

40:52.709 --> 40:55.644
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

40:58.514 --> 41:01.506
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

41:04.621 --> 41:07.419
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.400
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

41:18.868 --> 41:22.133
Which means that
it's retracted up into the pelvis.

41:22.572 --> 41:26.872
Which means that I have to find it and
clamp it. The only way to stop the bleeding.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.604
I got no more IVs.

41:30.380 --> 41:33.213
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

41:33.416 --> 41:34.781
Yeah, yeah.

41:35.918 --> 41:39.376
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.444
Okay?

41:40.556 --> 41:44.083
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.684
All right, you understand?

41:45.762 --> 41:48.094
- Morphine.
- I can't.

41:48.164 --> 41:50.894
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.527
Twombly, why don't you
take his hands there?

41:57.674 --> 42:00.666
I need you to hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

42:00.743 --> 42:03.075
Yurek, you're gonna take the feet
and a flashlight.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.306
On my count.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.541
All right, Jamie. All right.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.551
One. Two.

42:11.621 --> 42:12.679
Three.

42:20.396 --> 42:22.591
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

42:23.299 --> 42:24.926
I feel the pulse.

42:26.402 --> 42:27.733
I got it. I got it.

42:27.804 --> 42:29.396
I got it, yeah. I got it.

42:29.472 --> 42:31.337
- I got it.
- You got it?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.633
Clamp?

42:34.977 --> 42:36.342
I got it clamped.

42:36.412 --> 42:37.606
- Hold it.
- Got it.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.942
Here, grab it.

42:39.615 --> 42:41.344
- It's tearing.
- I got it.

42:41.584 --> 42:43.449
- Doc, it's going back in!
- Hold it!

42:43.519 --> 42:44.747
It's tearing!

42:45.088 --> 42:48.353
- Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
- Okay, I'm holding.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.049
Move your hand.

43:02.004 --> 43:03.096
What?

43:22.325 --> 43:23.485
Fix it?

43:26.929 --> 43:29.227
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

43:45.014 --> 43:46.914
What the hell are you doing?

43:46.983 --> 43:51.317
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

43:51.654 --> 43:53.884
Grimesy, you are squared away.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.076
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

44:16.145 --> 44:17.772
Gold Coast blend.

44:18.147 --> 44:21.139
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

44:21.651 --> 44:24.142
- No, it's not a problem.
- Come on, come on.

44:30.226 --> 44:33.423
- Where the hell did they find you?
- Behind a desk.

44:34.831 --> 44:37.561
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

44:41.404 --> 44:43.372
- Is anybody hit?
- We're good!

44:48.744 --> 44:49.938
You all right?

44:50.012 --> 44:51.001
Yeah!

44:51.180 --> 44:52.670
Is everybody all right?

44:52.748 --> 44:53.772
Yeah!

45:07.530 --> 45:08.792
Incoming!

46:14.263 --> 46:16.493
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

46:49.832 --> 46:51.561
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

46:51.634 --> 46:54.933
This is Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash site. Who's this? Over.

46:55.004 --> 46:56.904
This is Hoot.
I'm coming in with three friendlies.

46:56.973 --> 46:58.668
I need some cover and fire. Over.

46:58.741 --> 47:01.676
Roger that, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

47:01.744 --> 47:03.769
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

47:08.351 --> 47:12.981
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

47:13.689 --> 47:17.455
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.824
If we don't hold back this city...

47:20.529 --> 47:23.498
we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning.

47:23.599 --> 47:24.827
Yes, sir.

47:24.934 --> 47:27.630
Colonel Harrell,
ground personnel at crash site one...

47:27.703 --> 47:31.662
will have to mark the target with
infrared strobes in preparation for air strike.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.008
McKnight.

47:43.085 --> 47:46.680
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N.,
we got enough personnel, okay?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.621
Danny, you guys do not have to
go back out again.

48:10.813 --> 48:13.748
I can't die here, man.

48:14.550 --> 48:17.883
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

48:19.555 --> 48:21.022
I'm sorry.

48:21.490 --> 48:23.856
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

48:24.660 --> 48:27.151
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

48:29.198 --> 48:30.825
You okay, Twombs?

48:31.267 --> 48:33.132
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

48:34.336 --> 48:36.497
You did what you were trained to do.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.405
You should be proud of that.

48:42.344 --> 48:43.971
Be proud of that.

48:44.513 --> 48:46.378
- Ev?
- Yeah.

48:48.584 --> 48:49.915
Do me a favor.

48:50.786 --> 48:51.912
Yeah.

48:52.922 --> 48:56.722
You tell my parents that I fought well today.

48:57.993 --> 48:59.324
That I...

49:01.197 --> 49:02.528
That I...

49:05.401 --> 49:07.335
And that I fought hard.

49:09.238 --> 49:11.706
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

49:11.774 --> 49:13.298
Do you hear me?

49:15.010 --> 49:16.375
All right?

49:18.080 --> 49:21.072
- Are the humvees here?
- They're coming, Jamie.

49:21.584 --> 49:23.074
They're coming.

49:23.652 --> 49:25.916
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

49:25.988 --> 49:28.582
- You hold on for just a little bit.
- I can.

49:28.657 --> 49:29.817
I can.

49:31.193 --> 49:32.660
It's nothing.

49:33.896 --> 49:35.329
It's nothing.

49:36.198 --> 49:37.495
It's nothing.

49:37.566 --> 49:39.693
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

49:40.836 --> 49:42.064
Nothing.

49:49.845 --> 49:51.107
Oh, shit.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.204
Hold the wound.

50:20.276 --> 50:21.334
Doc.

50:24.146 --> 50:25.204
Doc.

50:42.731 --> 50:44.062
It's okay.

51:10.292 --> 51:12.021
What are you doing?

51:15.264 --> 51:16.925
We need the ammo.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.342
You did all you could here.

51:27.409 --> 51:29.309
They should've sent a medivac.

51:30.312 --> 51:34.146
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

51:34.250 --> 51:36.343
More men would get torn up.

51:39.655 --> 51:40.815
Maybe.

51:41.490 --> 51:43.617
See, you're thinking. Don't.

51:44.593 --> 51:47.756
Because, Sergeant, you can't control
who gets hit or who doesn't.

51:47.830 --> 51:50.298
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

51:50.532 --> 51:52.966
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

51:55.170 --> 51:57.468
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

51:58.641 --> 52:01.201
If Blackburn wouldn't have fallen,
none of this would have happened.

52:01.277 --> 52:03.541
Should have or could have, it don't matter.

52:03.612 --> 52:07.378
You'll get plenty of time
to think about all that later. Believe me.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.813
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

52:15.124 --> 52:16.955
You did it right today.

52:17.026 --> 52:20.462
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

52:26.902 --> 52:28.927
Well, shall we?

52:37.680 --> 52:40.205
I need four guys in this corner now!

52:46.822 --> 52:47.880
RPG!

52:52.194 --> 52:54.788
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.

52:54.863 --> 52:56.990
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

52:57.966 --> 53:01.094
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

53:01.170 --> 53:04.606
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who
down there. Too much activity.

53:04.673 --> 53:07.164
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

53:07.409 --> 53:08.569
Roger that.

53:19.922 --> 53:21.287
You see it?

53:23.859 --> 53:25.451
Nah, I can't see shit.

53:26.362 --> 53:29.297
- I'm putting it on the roof.
- You're going to need some help!

53:29.365 --> 53:30.354
Cover me.

53:31.567 --> 53:35.333
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

53:35.537 --> 53:36.526
Ready?

53:36.705 --> 53:37.694
One.

53:37.773 --> 53:38.865
Two.

53:39.041 --> 53:40.770
Three. Go!

54:13.342 --> 54:16.334
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

54:46.175 --> 54:48.541
Y'all keep your heads down.
We're coming back around.

54:48.610 --> 54:49.668
Copy that, C-4.

54:49.745 --> 54:54.444
C-2, this is 64. Where the hell is the convoy?
We're getting fucked here. Over.

54:54.650 --> 54:57.983
You're half a click from your location.
Hang in there.

55:02.391 --> 55:03.483
Shit!

55:16.305 --> 55:20.742
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

55:20.809 --> 55:23.801
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

55:24.046 --> 55:26.241
On your location, four minutes.

55:34.323 --> 55:36.587
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

55:36.658 --> 55:37.818
Move! Move!

55:37.893 --> 55:39.918
Lay down some cover fire!

55:42.664 --> 55:44.154
I thought I heard a noise out here!

55:44.233 --> 55:46.428
Get your men loaded up.
We're getting the hell out of here.

55:46.502 --> 55:47.526
Yes, sir.

55:50.172 --> 55:52.936
25, this is 64.
The rescue column has arrived.

55:53.008 --> 55:55.442
Will be at your location in about 5 minutes.

55:55.511 --> 55:57.479
Prepare your men for exfil, Sarg'nt.

55:57.546 --> 55:59.673
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

56:00.516 --> 56:04.282
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be
here in five minutes!

56:24.373 --> 56:26.637
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

56:26.742 --> 56:28.334
Here! It's my last one!

56:38.320 --> 56:40.049
The convoy is here!

56:58.874 --> 57:02.401
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

57:02.778 --> 57:04.040
Yes, sir!

57:04.146 --> 57:07.115
Bring your wounded right over there
and start loading them up!

57:14.323 --> 57:16.450
Hey, I got you. I got you.

57:16.658 --> 57:18.853
It's okay. I want to walk.

57:19.928 --> 57:22.362
Yeah, I would, too. Let's go!

57:32.240 --> 57:33.571
Move! Move!

57:36.545 --> 57:40.140
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.144
We're running out of room around here.

57:42.217 --> 57:45.015
Just gonna have to cram
into every possible space.

57:45.220 --> 57:50.214
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

57:50.425 --> 57:51.915
10th Mountain? No.

57:52.127 --> 57:55.221
Sir, with respect,
my Rangers can provide rear security.

57:55.330 --> 57:59.494
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

58:00.302 --> 58:01.826
Okay, let's get out of here.

58:01.903 --> 58:03.234
Let's go.

58:03.305 --> 58:05.796
- All right, you got him?
- Yeah, come on.

58:07.743 --> 58:08.971
Come on!

58:10.178 --> 58:13.579
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

58:13.649 --> 58:16.140
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.814
Careful.

58:20.422 --> 58:22.083
Easy. Go easy.

58:26.028 --> 58:27.120
Easy.

58:37.906 --> 58:40.136
Colonel, what is going on down there?

58:40.208 --> 58:43.405
They're dismantling
the entire cockpit around the body.

58:43.612 --> 58:47.275
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

58:48.216 --> 58:49.581
They can't say!

58:51.553 --> 58:52.781
Danny...

58:54.289 --> 58:56.086
no one gets left behind.

58:56.792 --> 58:58.692
You understand me, son?

58:59.094 --> 59:00.561
Yes, General.

59:01.430 --> 59:03.057
You do what you have to do.

59:04.232 --> 59:05.392
Roger.

59:15.043 --> 59:17.534
- How much longer?
- Forty-five minutes.

59:17.979 --> 59:20.447
- We don't have 45 minutes.
- What?

59:21.483 --> 59:25.681
We don't have 45 minutes.
Do you understand?

59:27.255 --> 59:28.882
Do you understand?

59:30.492 --> 59:31.584
Okay.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.861
- All right, come on. Bring him through.
- I got him.

59:35.397 --> 59:38.560
- Get all of his gear. Get the wounded out.
- Got you, sir!

59:43.872 --> 59:45.999
- Go! Move!
- Got you!

59:46.341 --> 59:48.366
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

59:58.286 --> 59:59.378
Fuck!

01:00:02.157 --> 01:00:03.317
Fire in the hole!

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.291
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:00:21.476 --> 01:00:24.877
- Open up the hatch! We got men back here!
- No room here! Go on the roof!

01:00:24.946 --> 01:00:26.038
What's going on?

01:00:26.114 --> 01:00:29.174
- The roof?
- I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.484
No, no, it's full.

01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:35.751
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.254
Move it! Let's go!

01:00:57.579 --> 01:01:00.013
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:03.641
- Move!
- Go! Move!

01:01:03.718 --> 01:01:04.742
Go!

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.699
Get down! Get down!

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:04.869
Get down, lady!

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.714
I'm out of ammo!

01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:11.644
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.617
Don't you do it.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.551
- What are you doing?
- Don't you damn do it.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:24.790
Kurth, let's go!

01:04:48.576 --> 01:04:50.066
Easy. Easy.

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:52.268
Ah, shit.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.969
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

01:06:02.484 --> 01:06:04.281
Aim later. Go!

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.444
Go!

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:12.187
Hurry up, hurry up.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:18.721
Hey, don't let that man crawl.
Somebody help that man.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.423
Help him.

01:06:23.238 --> 01:06:25.536
Grimes, you did good.

01:06:48.062 --> 01:06:49.324
Oh, shit!

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.125
Where are the baths, Major?

01:07:22.197 --> 01:07:23.892
They're through there, Captain.

01:07:49.657 --> 01:07:50.749
Ruiz.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.585
Hey, Sarg'nt. Hey.

01:07:58.266 --> 01:07:59.426
Captain.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.025
Lorenzo. How you doing?

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:09.639
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

01:08:09.944 --> 01:08:11.605
That's great news.

01:08:12.413 --> 01:08:13.812
We're going after them?

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.782
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:20.254
Don't go out without me.

01:08:21.256 --> 01:08:24.020
Don't go back out there without me.

01:08:25.627 --> 01:08:27.492
I can still do my job.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.357
You get some rest now, okay?

01:08:33.301 --> 01:08:34.461
Grimes.

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:39.665
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

01:08:44.312 --> 01:08:45.939
How you doing, soldier?

01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:48.844
Can't feel a thing.

01:09:05.166 --> 01:09:06.962
You're going back in?

01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:10.765
There are still men out there.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.102
God damn.

01:09:19.514 --> 01:09:21.140
When I go home...

01:09:21.883 --> 01:09:23.407
and people ask me:

01:09:23.484 --> 01:09:26.145
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:31.051
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.153
I won't say a goddamn word.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:35.888
Why?

01:09:36.898 --> 01:09:38.763
They won't understand.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.792
They won't understand why we do it.

01:09:44.037 --> 01:09:47.404
They won't understand
it's about the men next to you.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.466
And that's it.

01:09:53.413 --> 01:09:55.041
That's all it is.

01:10:03.925 --> 01:10:08.862
Hey, don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:16.995
Hey, we started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:32.720
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

01:10:32.787 --> 01:10:36.917
and he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.891
And I said, "Nothing."

01:10:41.562 --> 01:10:45.293
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.524
I know I've changed.

01:10:54.308 --> 01:10:57.038
A friend of mine asked me
before I got here...

01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:59.341
It was when we were all shipping out.

01:10:59.414 --> 01:11:00.813
He asked me:

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:05.378
"Why are you going to fight
somebody else's war?

01:11:05.787 --> 01:11:08.381
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

01:11:11.159 --> 01:11:13.889
I didn't know what to say at the time...

01:11:16.464 --> 01:11:19.058
but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

01:11:21.469 --> 01:11:23.801
I'd say there's no way in hell.

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.597
Nobody asks to be a hero.

01:11:31.946 --> 01:11:34.210
It just sometimes turns out that way.

01:11:38.219 --> 01:11:41.677
I'm gonna talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

01:12:48.356 --> 01:12:52.053
My love, you are strong
and you will do well in life.

01:12:54.228 --> 01:12:56.696
I love you and my children deeply.

01:12:57.598 --> 01:13:00.795
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:06.500
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:10.242
So, in closing, my love...

01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:14.445
tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

01:13:14.882 --> 01:13:18.784
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:22.053
and give them both
a kiss good night for Daddy.
