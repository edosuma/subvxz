<b>Akatsuki 
Race/ Human 
Assassin, Lv. 92 
Log Horizon</b>

00:12.310 --> 00:14.460
An elemental blizzard attack...

00:14.920 --> 00:19.190
And the Royal Guard's armor 
is boosting all of his stats!

00:19.940 --> 00:22.470
When you actually see it up close, 
it really seems like cheating.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.800
I'll ask again. Have you ever been in a raid?

00:26.150 --> 00:27.250
Nope.

00:27.620 --> 00:28.950
Me, neither.

00:28.950 --> 00:33.010
I don't feel like facing the new year 
on the cold Cathedral floor.

00:33.010 --> 00:34.300
Right.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.130
This is our first battle!

00:36.670 --> 00:37.760
Yeah.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.010
Target sighted.

02:13.010 --> 02:16.180
Moving toward Old Ogawa Town, on Chuo Street.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.390
Group C has made contact.

02:17.390 --> 02:18.360
One healer present.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.700
Group D is to rendezvous immediately.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.370
All other groups are to remain on standby.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.170
Group C is Akatsuki, right?

02:25.170 --> 02:26.170
Yeah.

02:26.170 --> 02:27.920
So far, it's gone according to plan.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.600
Her detection abilities are crazy.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.010
It's finally time!

02:32.380 --> 02:33.750
Will you be okay, Kyouko?

02:33.750 --> 02:36.130
I'm the athletic type, after all.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.480
Let's go all-out!

02:38.480 --> 02:39.590
All-out!

02:40.390 --> 02:46.130
<b>Akihabara Raid</b>

02:43.170 --> 02:44.380
Akihabara Raid.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.560
<i>Know your enemy.</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:57.490
<i>Know exactly what he can and cannot do.</i>

03:00.210 --> 03:02.820
<i>And face yourself.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:06.830
<i>Face your own weakness!</i>

03:10.940 --> 03:12.710
<i>Death Stinger!</i>

03:12.910 --> 03:15.210
She hit him! That's a poison DoT!

03:19.310 --> 03:23.610
<i>I've always been ashamed of my small size.</i>

03:25.000 --> 03:25.890
<i>But...</i>

03:26.460 --> 03:30.250
Your blood will be as dew on my blade, adventurer!

03:40.110 --> 03:43.110
<i>The gifts everyone gave me are supporting me.</i>

03:43.240 --> 03:44.600
Akatsuki!

03:44.600 --> 03:45.620
I'm fine.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.870
I'll end you!

03:54.760 --> 03:56.500
<i>Orion Delay Blow!</i>

04:00.390 --> 04:02.630
Get to the next area now!

04:02.630 --> 04:03.930
Thanks!

04:03.930 --> 04:05.140
Thank you!

04:05.910 --> 04:09.330
You're running away, girl?

04:13.460 --> 04:15.150
A raid in Akihabara?

04:15.610 --> 04:19.230
When this was a game, I never 
could've imagined that.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.800
<i>Viper's Trash!</i>

04:23.660 --> 04:25.350
<i>Bloody Piercing!</i>

04:26.780 --> 04:30.990
Why aren't the other Royal Guards 
coming to arrest Nelreth?

04:31.580 --> 04:36.290
The system is set up so that 
only we can be arrested.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.680
Which is what makes it possible for 
us to fight him in town, but...

04:42.520 --> 04:45.300
You're still running, girl?

04:48.170 --> 04:50.060
We'll slow him down a little here.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.610
Get to the next area!

04:51.610 --> 04:53.520
We're with you.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.480
So don't worry, and smack him hard.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.760
Got it!

04:56.760 --> 04:58.210
Thanks!

04:59.610 --> 05:07.590
For every adventurer within fifty meters, 
Rugrius gets a boost to his stats.

05:07.590 --> 05:11.040
That's why we've put a curfew in effect.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.750
The only people in town are the twenty-four 
members of the full raid.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.380
We've formed them into small groups,

05:17.380 --> 05:19.250
and put them as far apart as possible.

05:19.690 --> 05:24.630
And Akatsuki is leading the 
murderer through the city,

05:24.630 --> 05:26.270
so that he passes through each area.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.720
<b>Contact</b>

05:26.690 --> 05:28.700
Kiting, in other words.

05:28.700 --> 05:34.270
Each group will simultaneously heal 
their allies and attack the enemy.

05:35.020 --> 05:38.170
I can see why you're the training squad head

05:38.170 --> 05:40.490
for the Yamato server's largest 
combat guild, D.D.D.!

05:40.940 --> 05:43.280
This plan is going to work!

05:43.590 --> 05:46.530
Yes. Or it would, if this were a game.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.530
But this isn't a game anymore.

05:51.130 --> 05:55.040
Not every raid is designed so that it's possible to win.

05:55.450 --> 06:01.350
The enemy has that katana, as well as 
Royal Guard armor, and he can teleport.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.820
He's entered the next area!

06:04.820 --> 06:08.800
I'll rip you apart, adventurers.

06:09.650 --> 06:11.680
Wait, Nelreth...

06:11.680 --> 06:13.610
First, that girl.

06:14.260 --> 06:17.810
And it gives him the knowledge and 
experience of a Royal Guard.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.200
There's no guarantee he will act the way we expect.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.410
Rieze-san...

06:24.560 --> 06:25.830
I'm sorry.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.720
Is it okay if I complain for a bit?

06:29.620 --> 06:31.320
I just realized

06:31.990 --> 06:34.090
how terrifying it is

06:34.090 --> 06:38.830
to involve someone else and not be able 
to take responsibility for them...

06:40.980 --> 06:45.980
That princess has faced this terror 
since she was born, hasn't she?

06:46.690 --> 06:48.420
I respect that.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.750
That's true for everyone at the Round Table.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.100
And you, too, right?

06:53.050 --> 06:54.440
For now, it is.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.490
For now, focus on your job.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.100
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.600
Group D is to heal, and then 
meet up with Group C again.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.960
Group F is to change course.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.420
Stand by at road D!

07:13.070 --> 07:15.190
You're sure about this?

07:15.810 --> 07:16.870
Yes.

07:16.870 --> 07:21.090
This city will be defenseless 
against external attacks.

07:21.690 --> 07:25.520
It may not be able to stop internal fighting, 
and the zone will become lawless.

07:26.050 --> 07:26.880
Yes.

07:30.070 --> 07:33.760
This failure is not only the 
Kunie Clan's responsibility,

07:33.760 --> 07:36.390
but that of all the People of the Land.

07:37.150 --> 07:39.790
We need to do what we can

07:39.790 --> 07:42.840
to apologize to the adventurers.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.530
This time, that means shutting off the magic supply.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.400
You may end up causing them greater trouble.

07:52.830 --> 07:55.170
Don't worry.

07:55.600 --> 08:01.410
As I've said before, the Round 
Table has agreed to this.

08:01.770 --> 08:04.750
As fellow citizens of Akihabara,

08:04.750 --> 08:07.920
we'll do whatever it takes to 
help you put a stop to this.

08:09.710 --> 08:11.050
Very well.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.730
Regardless of the cause of this,

08:14.730 --> 08:17.930
it's true that the Kunie Clan has 
failed to keep the city safe.

08:19.140 --> 08:23.690
We've left a blotch on our several-century-long history

08:23.690 --> 08:27.180
of operating the magic circle and protecting the city.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.220
Then...

08:29.990 --> 08:32.030
As you say,

08:32.030 --> 08:36.740
we need to find something we can do and do it.

08:37.420 --> 08:40.550
We need to take a step forward, 
instead of rejecting you.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.330
I'm sorry for testing you earlier.

08:45.830 --> 08:51.420
And I'd like you to know I am in 
your debt for this, Lenessia.

08:54.060 --> 08:58.720
Of course, I'd prefer to pay 
that debt to someone else.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.730
Let us go, then.

09:06.590 --> 09:07.990
What is this?

09:07.990 --> 09:09.230
Come this way.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.240
Yes.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.500
Team J, get out of there.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.070
I'll tell you where to rendezvous 
after healing in a moment.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.390
Team D will continue to its designated position.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.210
Engage in approximately thirty seconds!

09:27.060 --> 09:29.210
Are you okay, Marielle?

09:29.390 --> 09:31.030
Just fine!

09:31.030 --> 09:33.230
I could keep this up all night!

09:34.520 --> 09:35.720
Why?

09:36.470 --> 09:37.630
Why?

09:38.870 --> 09:42.050
Sutu Inaw, why did you betray me?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.050
Shut up!

09:44.050 --> 09:45.210
Get back!

09:44.050 --> 09:46.230
I'm not Rugrius!

09:45.210 --> 09:46.230
Right!

09:46.510 --> 09:49.140
No, this girl betrayed me!

09:49.140 --> 09:52.230
Me, a proud hero!

09:52.820 --> 09:54.610
<i>Summon Servant: Golem!</i>

10:06.280 --> 10:08.430

10:08.430 --> 10:09.460

10:57.090 --> 10:58.800
<i>I'm weak.</i>

10:59.340 --> 11:03.220
This katana wants your blood.

11:10.610 --> 11:11.770
<i>Faster...</i>

11:12.410 --> 11:14.150
<i>Faster! Faster!</i>

11:14.580 --> 11:15.850
<i>Faster!</i>

11:19.860 --> 11:21.640
What is this?

11:24.480 --> 11:26.370
Akatsuki is multiplying...

11:28.570 --> 11:29.840
What was that?

11:29.840 --> 11:34.000
I wanted to go fast so badly, 
I activated Hide Shadow.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.510
I should only be able to use it when 
moving around, but I did it anyway?

11:54.270 --> 11:56.360
Looks like she finally learned one.

Awesome, Akatsuki!

<i>You can't learn the Teachings from someone else.</i>

12:02.710 --> 12:07.560
<i>It's a state you reach after endlessly

12:11.810 --> 12:13.230
<i>How stupid.</i>

12:16.000 --> 12:18.550
<i>You just forget what you knew from the game,</i>

12:18.550 --> 12:21.230
<i>and use your abilities to their fullest.</i>

12:21.780 --> 12:23.910
<i>That's all it was.</i>

12:25.280 --> 12:26.540
How stupid.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.340
<i>I sought power outside of myself.</i>

12:30.860 --> 12:32.440
<i>Just like you.</i>

12:32.980 --> 12:34.230
<i>But...</i>

12:45.640 --> 12:47.280
<i>and that power controlled you.</i>

12:48.260 --> 12:50.500
<i>Which means your overwhelming strength</i>

12:52.530 --> 12:55.750
<i>is much more fragile than my weakness!</i>

Okay.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.120
<i>Originally, Haganemushi had the effect</i>

15:17.120 --> 15:20.390
<i>of lowering the condition of an 
enemy weapon it touches.</i>

15:24.000 --> 15:25.660
<i>I need to end this quickly</i>

15:26.150 --> 15:28.350
<i>for everyone's sake!</i>

15:28.890 --> 15:30.140
Again?

15:34.450 --> 15:35.700
<i>No!</i>

15:37.860 --> 15:39.630
<i>Senpuu Izuna!</i>

15:40.220 --> 15:42.210
Don't build up too much aggro.

15:42.210 --> 15:43.560
I know!

15:42.210 --> 15:47.210
<b>Party Chat</b>

15:43.560 --> 15:45.820
Isami, how's the enemy's HP looking?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.210
Um...

15:47.210 --> 15:50.520
The bar is acting weird, 
but it's around twenty percent.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.820
I don't know the absolute value...

15:51.820 --> 15:53.220
Understood.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.500
Team C will swap Marielle and Nazuna.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.730
Move.

15:57.730 --> 15:58.720
Roger.

15:59.140 --> 16:03.230
If the enemy's a raid boss, its attack 
pattern should be changing soon.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.240
Be careful.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.920
Roger.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.690
Team K is ready to move, as well.

16:07.690 --> 16:09.240
Follow backup plan 6!

16:09.580 --> 16:10.670
Got it!

16:11.020 --> 16:13.740
That was quick. He broke through already?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.170
Engage!

16:15.170 --> 16:17.330
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage!</i>

16:17.890 --> 16:19.290
<i>Rapid Shot!</i>

16:24.390 --> 16:29.370
Now then, if you're Shiroe's friend, 
you're my friend.

16:29.370 --> 16:30.980
I'll have to help you.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.090
What's wrong?

16:34.740 --> 16:36.290
You're crying.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.690
So this is a raid...

16:40.690 --> 16:42.600
It's amazing, huh? Yeah.

16:43.070 --> 16:47.230
While I'm at it, I'll show you my Teaching, too.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.180
<i>Divine Step!</i>

16:53.490 --> 16:54.880
What's this?

16:54.880 --> 16:58.120
Walls of Purification are damage-blocking spells.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.730
You're using them as steps in the air?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.910
Is that how you saved me back there?

17:03.910 --> 17:05.420
Yep.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.630
It's just a different way to use them.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.510
Stupid, huh?

17:12.450 --> 17:14.010
You're right.

17:23.310 --> 17:27.740
It looks more likely that he's about to die than 
that he's about to change attack patterns.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.030
You're done running around.

17:36.510 --> 17:37.530
Three...

17:37.860 --> 17:39.030
Two...

17:39.030 --> 17:40.030
One...

17:40.690 --> 17:41.810
Now!

17:58.550 --> 18:01.620
Y-You're just outside the fifty-meter area...

18:01.620 --> 18:02.600
Do it!

18:03.230 --> 18:07.080
<i>Freezing Liner!</i>

18:16.600 --> 18:19.490
I won't let you shed another drop 
of my companions' blood!

18:20.130 --> 18:22.300
Take this instead!

18:26.560 --> 18:27.770
We did it!

18:30.930 --> 18:32.930
You can't teleport.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.010
We cut off your magic supply.

18:35.420 --> 18:38.450
That armor is just a hunk of metal.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.010
Girl...

18:47.600 --> 18:48.810
Curse you!

18:48.810 --> 18:53.150
Curse you, adventurer!

19:21.660 --> 19:24.810
<b>Haganemushi Tatara

19:25.990 --> 19:27.790

19:28.280 --> 19:31.310

19:56.200 --> 19:57.900
It's over, isn't it?

19:57.900 --> 20:02.160
Yes. His remaining HP didn't matter.

20:02.470 --> 20:05.880
We were only after that cursed katana.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.940
It was a wonderful plan.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.350
Okay!

20:19.160 --> 20:21.650
Good work. I'm impressed.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.570
You should be.

20:24.130 --> 20:28.200
Girls really are strong, aren't they, Shiro?

20:28.820 --> 20:30.810
Okay, we have New Year's soba here!

20:30.810 --> 20:33.510
Lots of desserts, too!

20:35.900 --> 20:38.800
Oh, wow! This is amazing!

20:38.800 --> 20:41.080
I've never been to a pajama party before.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.130
Me, neither.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.270
Oh, no!

20:43.270 --> 20:45.420
If I eat it all, I'll get fat!

20:45.420 --> 20:46.800
But I'll eat it today anyway.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.510
It's like a red vs. white party!

20:48.510 --> 20:51.640
I know you'll all be on the red 
team, so should I be white?

20:53.340 --> 20:58.120
The curfew in Akihabara's been lifted, 
and everyone's having a party outside.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.980
Now Minori and the others will 
be able to come back.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.420
By the way, um...

21:03.420 --> 21:05.160
I don't think you need to worry.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.100
Seeing everyone in their pajamas 
just knocked all her screws loose.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.180
Right...

21:12.240 --> 21:15.130
Akatsuki, thank you.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.720
I should thank you, Lenessia.

21:28.170 --> 21:34.370
<i>My lord, protecting someone means 
giving them a place to belong.</i>

21:35.350 --> 21:38.360
<i>Giving them a place where they can be happy.</i>

<i>I finally understand.</i>

21:41.030 --> 21:44.260
<i>That's why you were working so hard.</i>

Akatsuki?

21:56.950 --> 21:57.960
Hello?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.370
M-My lord?

22:00.370 --> 22:01.550
What is it?

22:01.550 --> 22:03.800
Weren't we supposed to not use telepathy?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.370
That's true, but...

22:06.180 --> 22:09.320
It's rare for you to break your own rules...

22:09.320 --> 22:11.400
Is that how people think of me?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.500
Yep!

22:12.500 --> 22:14.450
You're a stiff blockhead!

22:14.450 --> 22:16.980
It went well, didn't it, Akatsuki?

22:18.820 --> 22:19.730
Congratulations.

22:21.060 --> 22:22.610
My lord...

22:22.610 --> 22:24.490
We still have some work to do here.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.490
But we won't give up, either.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.700
We're about to give it another retry.

24:05.540 --> 24:08.640
On Christmas Eve night, Shiroe and the others died.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.250
The rules have changed.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.420
This world isn't a game anymore.

24:12.420 --> 24:14.350
Their time is over.

24:14.350 --> 24:15.880
They've been rejected.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.350
Shiroe loses his physical body and 
wanders a town of memories.

24:19.350 --> 24:22.420
On a moonlit beach, he encounters Akatsuki.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.070
Next time: The Changing Battlefield.

24:22.900 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Changing Battlefield</b>

24:25.670 --> 24:27.960
Rise up once more.
