WEBVTT

00:03.544 --> 00:04.544
Henry Winchester.

00:04.745 --> 00:06.105
My father
and his father before him

00:06.246 --> 00:07.246
were both Men of Letters.

00:07.448 --> 00:08.728
If you guys
were such a big deal,

00:08.949 --> 00:10.429
then why haven't we
ever heard of you?

00:10.617 --> 00:11.709
Josie.

00:11.952 --> 00:14.512
No one told me this initiation
was a formal affair.

00:14.755 --> 00:16.814
The hard part's over, right?
We made it.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.821
What do you know about the
Men of Letters massacre of 1958?

00:21.328 --> 00:23.421
My name is Abaddon.
We will march into Hell.

00:23.664 --> 00:26.258
And demonkind will rise up
and sweep over the earth.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.467
Who put Crowley in charge?

00:27.701 --> 00:29.566
The king's dead.
Long live the queen.

00:29.837 --> 00:32.168
You knew about the Mark.
You knew about Abaddon and Cain.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.430
You knew all of it.

00:34.074 --> 00:35.074
And you played me.

00:35.943 --> 00:37.205
You owe me!

00:37.745 --> 00:38.939
You make me a junkie.

00:39.613 --> 00:40.671
You keep me stashed away
for months

00:40.914 --> 00:42.074
while my kingdom falls apart?

00:42.349 --> 00:43.349
So, where is the Blade?

00:43.550 --> 00:45.609
This is the object of your quest.

00:46.687 --> 00:47.687
Dean!

00:48.455 --> 00:49.615
Drop the Blade.

00:50.858 --> 00:52.416
I'll hang on
to old donkey teeth here

00:52.659 --> 00:55.560
until such time
as you locate Abaddon.

01:05.305 --> 01:06.863
I'll tell you, one of
the things that I really love

01:07.107 --> 01:08.802
about the Tour Angle 144.

01:09.576 --> 01:10.543
There are a lot of you out there

01:10.778 --> 01:12.575
that have something
called the chipping yips.

01:12.813 --> 01:15.008
You're not proud of having them.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.183
A lot of people don't even
want to talk about it.

01:17.418 --> 01:18.698
If you don't have them, be glad.

01:19.386 --> 01:22.549
But I got to tell you,
this product...

01:22.856 --> 01:24.380
What's on the menu tonight?

01:24.992 --> 01:28.155
- Meatloaf.
- Really? Again?

01:28.395 --> 01:31.156
You're gonna make little
motions back and through just...

01:31.432 --> 01:33.423
I wish you wouldn't say that.

01:35.035 --> 01:37.526
You know how hard I work all day,
and yet you criticize me.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.972
So, yes.
We're having meatloaf.

01:49.082 --> 01:50.082
With potatoes...

01:51.051 --> 01:52.279
And broccoli...

01:53.253 --> 01:54.481
...and lots of good things.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.303
Hey.

02:10.971 --> 02:12.336
Hey.

02:12.573 --> 02:14.507
You catch any shut-eye
last night?

02:15.242 --> 02:16.573
Nope.

02:16.944 --> 02:18.571
Guess I'm driving, then.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.302
Driving where?

02:21.081 --> 02:22.844
Caught wind of a case online.

02:23.217 --> 02:25.583
First grade teacher came home
and killed her husband.

02:26.186 --> 02:27.585
Well, maybe she snapped.

02:27.821 --> 02:29.288
Ankle biters can do that to you.

02:29.656 --> 02:32.147
Dude, she pounded him,
into ground chuck.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.300
So, what are you thinking?

02:34.528 --> 02:36.359
Best guess... possession.

02:38.632 --> 02:40.998
Why don't you go?

02:43.170 --> 02:44.170
Dean, look.

02:44.371 --> 02:45.861
I want to find Abaddon, too...

02:46.106 --> 02:48.370
but we've been combing
through this stuff for days.

02:48.609 --> 02:49.974
Well, maybe we missed something.

02:50.544 --> 02:53.342
And maybe there are better ways
to spend our time

02:53.580 --> 02:55.946
than just spin our... -
Maybe we don't have time.

02:56.984 --> 02:58.144
What's up with you?

02:59.019 --> 03:00.919
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

03:01.588 --> 03:04.079
See, because ever since
you killed Magnus,

03:04.424 --> 03:08.793
you've been acting...
sort of... obsessed.

03:11.732 --> 03:15.463
Well, maybe because I want
an end to all this.

03:16.336 --> 03:17.997
Maybe because
if we find Abaddon,

03:18.238 --> 03:19.758
then Crowley ponies up
the First Blade,

03:19.973 --> 03:22.533
and we kill her and him both.

03:22.776 --> 03:24.505
So, what you call being "obsessed,"

03:24.878 --> 03:27.073
I call doing my job.

03:29.616 --> 03:32.107
Okay, um...

03:32.819 --> 03:35.788
I get it, Dean.
I'm just checking in.

03:36.023 --> 03:37.422
I'm fine.

03:38.525 --> 03:39.525
All right.

03:40.227 --> 03:42.821
Hit me up if you find anything.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.153
It says here in your report
that you were the first on the scene?

04:15.395 --> 04:16.656
Yes, sir.
I found Mrs. Young

04:16.897 --> 04:18.817
sitting next
to her husband covered in his blood.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.433
Now, was her husband abusive?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.065
Ric?
Oh, no. Not at all.

04:22.302 --> 04:25.032
I mean, he could be a stubborn
SOB, but can't we all?

04:26.273 --> 04:27.797
Anything else, uh, weird

04:28.041 --> 04:29.941
that maybe you felt
was too odd to include?

04:30.177 --> 04:32.873
- Like?
- Like, did you smell sulfur?

04:33.747 --> 04:34.747
Why would I smell sulfur?

04:35.015 --> 04:36.380
Of course. Uh, thank you.

04:37.217 --> 04:39.811
What about Karen's eyes?
You noticed anything strange?

04:40.320 --> 04:43.414
Actually, Agent, they, uh,
pretty much looked like eyes.

04:44.124 --> 04:45.557
Oh, lord.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.904
I don't get this.
Karen and Ric were

05:09.149 --> 05:11.029
two of the most ordinary people
you'd ever meet.

05:11.918 --> 05:14.716
Did she go anywhere
on the day of the murder?

05:15.589 --> 05:16.681
It was Saturday.

05:18.025 --> 05:20.823
A quick trip to the grocery store.
That's about it.

05:38.545 --> 05:39.569
How's Mrs. Manson doing?

05:40.414 --> 05:42.245
Dead.
Hung herself in her cell.

05:43.183 --> 05:44.309
Lovely.

05:44.951 --> 05:46.714
- The demon smoke out?
- If it was a demon.

05:46.953 --> 05:49.183
I mean, there was no sulfur,
no EMF anywhere.

05:49.423 --> 05:51.186
And everyone who saw her
just before she gutted her husband

05:51.425 --> 05:52.465
said she was totally fine.

05:52.793 --> 05:53.993
What are you still doing there?

05:53.994 --> 05:55.754
This sounds like
a case of the crazies to me.

05:56.029 --> 05:57.189
Well, if nothing kicks up
by morning, I'm out of here.

05:57.431 --> 05:59.194
How's the research going?

06:02.002 --> 06:03.333
It's going.

06:05.238 --> 06:06.432
All right. Well, uh...

06:07.340 --> 06:08.340
Good luck.

06:19.252 --> 06:20.844
I can give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

06:21.288 --> 06:22.687
- Can I use it to kill that bitch?
- Yes.

06:23.123 --> 06:25.353
But you have to know with
the Mark comes a great burden.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.360
Uh-huh.

07:02.262 --> 07:05.629
Yep...
No. I know. I'm sorry.

07:06.299 --> 07:08.130
No, I'll make it up to you.
Look, I'm trying to get there, babe,

07:08.368 --> 07:09.728
but I got into a fight
with my mom.

07:10.537 --> 07:12.368
Oh, I think I got a bite.

07:12.906 --> 07:14.635
Yeah, a van is pulling up.
Let me roll.

07:14.908 --> 07:15.908
I love you. Bye.

07:18.178 --> 07:20.669
Oh, hey! I didn't know this was
your ride, Mr. Richie.

07:21.548 --> 07:23.709
Let's get you out of the cold.

07:25.485 --> 07:26.485
Thanks.

07:27.721 --> 07:30.622
It's freezing out there.

07:31.725 --> 07:33.886
Hey, what...
what are you doing?

07:34.294 --> 07:36.922
Get off me! No! No!

07:47.774 --> 07:49.935
Order up.

07:52.112 --> 07:54.307
- Here you go.
- Thanks, RJ.

07:55.982 --> 07:57.382
Can I get you anything else, honey?

07:58.218 --> 07:59.338
Uh, this is great.
Thank you.

07:59.853 --> 08:01.047
Order up.

08:04.090 --> 08:07.082
Be with you in a minute, Bill.

08:10.764 --> 08:13.084
Billy, what are you doing?
Your mother raise you in a barn?

08:13.166 --> 08:15.157
Don't talk to me like that!

08:17.170 --> 08:20.230
Hey. Take it easy.
She's working hard.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.509
What's eating you?

08:26.112 --> 08:29.138
You. My mom.

08:29.382 --> 08:30.382
Him.

08:30.784 --> 08:33.719
Buddy... Give it a rest.

08:35.121 --> 08:37.715
Billy? Billy.

08:37.957 --> 08:39.878
I'm gonna call your mom,
have her come fetch you.

08:41.061 --> 08:42.494
No, you're not.

09:06.219 --> 09:07.739
So, tell me
what's happening here.

09:07.821 --> 09:09.152
I was hoping you'd tell me.

09:09.389 --> 09:10.789
You're the one
that mentioned weird.

09:11.024 --> 09:12.082
Now, where did
they all come from?

09:12.325 --> 09:13.325
Oh, they're all locals.

09:13.827 --> 09:15.795
Four of the straightest arrows
you'd ever meet.

09:16.696 --> 09:18.696
Apparently, they've been
acting like this for days.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.423
Do they share anything
in common?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.430
Church? School?
Uh, book club?

09:22.836 --> 09:23.962
Not of my knowledge.

09:24.804 --> 09:26.396
I met the kid's girlfriend.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.938
She said he was hitching a ride
when a van picked him up,

09:29.175 --> 09:30.655
and that's the last she heard of him.

09:32.312 --> 09:33.836
Whatever that's worth.

09:51.865 --> 09:52.865
You're not...

09:54.501 --> 09:55.501
What are you, Billy?

09:56.970 --> 09:57.970
Clear.

09:59.572 --> 10:00.903
Of?

10:01.875 --> 10:03.638
Everything.

10:05.712 --> 10:06.804
Why are you doing this?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.320
You think there's a "why"?

10:09.349 --> 10:11.544
No.
It's because I want to.

10:12.552 --> 10:13.576
And I can.

10:19.893 --> 10:21.258
Grocery store surveillance pics.

10:22.162 --> 10:23.322
Great. Thank you.

10:33.039 --> 10:35.769
- Hey.
- Well, that took forever.

10:36.643 --> 10:38.270
Uh, well, I'm working.

10:39.913 --> 10:42.108
- You got anything?
- Not sure.

10:42.349 --> 10:44.783
But, um,
a handful of other people

10:45.018 --> 10:46.178
have started acting out, too.

10:46.786 --> 10:48.586
- Acting out how?
- Well, same as the woman...

10:49.055 --> 10:51.785
...aggressive, violent, impulsive.

10:52.192 --> 10:53.552
Sounds like
you're in a Gold's gym.

10:53.793 --> 10:55.886
Yeah. Except it's less
steroid-induced,

10:56.129 --> 10:57.994
and more... basic instinct.

10:59.065 --> 11:01.556
It's like the littlest things
can set them off.

11:03.269 --> 11:04.269
Kind of like me.

11:05.005 --> 11:06.125
You've got no instinct.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.440
I mean, you are
seriously messed up.

11:10.977 --> 11:13.275
- You?
- Yeah, uh, soulless me.

11:13.513 --> 11:15.743
- Remember that?
- Yeah, how could I forget?

11:16.649 --> 11:18.569
But you weren't out of control
like these people.

11:19.119 --> 11:21.519
Yeah, well, maybe everyone
has a different reaction

11:21.755 --> 11:23.552
- to losing their soul.
- Possible.

11:23.990 --> 11:27.858
So, what? A crossroads demon making
deals and taking people's souls?

11:28.328 --> 11:29.528
No, I don't think so.
I mean...

11:29.863 --> 11:31.943
...it's not as if these
people are winning the lotto.

11:32.699 --> 11:35.566
Okay... Uh, well,
that was my best swing.

11:35.802 --> 11:36.802
I hope not, Dean.

11:37.003 --> 11:38.834
I could really use
your help down here.

11:41.641 --> 11:43.302
- Dean?
- Yeah, no, I...

11:43.543 --> 11:45.875
I heard you.
I just, uh...

11:48.548 --> 11:49.708
I'm getting close, Sam.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.445
I can't drop the ball on Abaddon
right now.

11:53.987 --> 11:55.215
All right. Be safe.

11:58.758 --> 12:01.318
You're lying to Sam
like he's your wife...

12:03.430 --> 12:06.194
...which kind of makes me
your mistress.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.842
Now, listen to me, young man.
Those demons are back.

12:19.779 --> 12:21.619
I'm telling you,
it's happening all over again.

12:22.348 --> 12:24.873
- Demons?
- Yes! Demons. Are you deaf?

12:26.252 --> 12:27.549
Yes, ma'am. You know what?
We're gonna take care

12:27.787 --> 12:28.867
of those demons right away.

12:30.090 --> 12:31.730
Now, do you need a ride home
or something?

12:31.758 --> 12:33.385
Don't patronize me,
you little turd.

12:33.626 --> 12:37.187
Hey, you know what?
I can take it from here. Um, Agent Leiter.

12:41.167 --> 12:42.794
Please.

12:44.604 --> 12:46.164
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

12:46.306 --> 12:47.306
Sure.

12:47.507 --> 12:49.134
Now, why don't you, uh,

12:49.476 --> 12:51.706
tell me all about these demons,
Ms. Wilkinson?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.106
Please, call me Julia.

12:55.048 --> 12:57.414
It's very simple, Agent.
They...

12:58.918 --> 13:00.385
They came to Milton.

13:02.489 --> 13:03.717
And?

13:05.625 --> 13:07.559
I say "demons,"
and you don't bat an eye,

13:08.061 --> 13:10.427
when everyone else around here
thinks I'm nuts on toast.

13:12.332 --> 13:15.597
Maybe I'm just a bit more, uh,
open-minded than most.

13:16.903 --> 13:18.063
Maybe.

13:21.174 --> 13:22.505
You're one of them, aren't you?

13:24.577 --> 13:26.807
- Sorry. One of who?
- Men of Letters.

13:27.747 --> 13:29.647
They came here in 1958.

13:32.352 --> 13:34.718
Men of Letters...
came here?

13:35.321 --> 13:37.118
Oh, yes.
It was different then.

13:38.658 --> 13:39.920
I was different.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.987
They were a lovely couple.

13:49.135 --> 13:52.434
Sister Julia,
please answer the door.

13:53.106 --> 13:55.097
Yes, Mother Superior.

14:05.585 --> 14:06.847
Good evening, sister.

14:07.787 --> 14:10.620
We're here from
the Office of the Inquisition.

14:25.438 --> 14:26.996
What do you want?

14:27.607 --> 14:30.041
You tell me, Romeo.
You rang.

14:30.677 --> 14:33.771
Let me guess,
you butt-dialed me?

14:34.581 --> 14:36.242
Whatever the hell that is.

14:36.482 --> 14:39.076
Either way, we done here?

14:39.819 --> 14:42.413
Actually, as long as I'm here,
last time we chitchatted,

14:42.655 --> 14:45.624
we agreed that you were gonna
line up Carrot Top.

14:45.858 --> 14:49.453
Yep, well... I'm on it.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.795
Unless Abaddon likes
ten cent wings, stale beer,

14:55.034 --> 14:56.592
and the clap,
I doubt that she's here.

15:01.341 --> 15:02.638
Go to hell.

15:02.875 --> 15:05.105
Oh, if only.

15:05.345 --> 15:06.744
What's going on with you, huh?

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
You call me, you hang up.

15:08.781 --> 15:10.408
You want Abaddon,
you don't want Abaddon.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.577
You want the Blade,
you don't want the Blade.

15:12.852 --> 15:15.092
If I didn't know you any better,
I'd say you're stalling.

15:22.895 --> 15:25.864
Just between us girls,
how did you feel

15:26.099 --> 15:28.624
when you sunk the First Blade
into Magnus' head?

15:30.870 --> 15:32.870
Not half as good as I'm gonna
feel when it's yours.

15:36.776 --> 15:38.300
Love it when you talk dirty.

15:39.312 --> 15:40.745
You know what I think?

15:41.414 --> 15:43.041
I think you felt powerful...

15:44.250 --> 15:45.250
Virile...

15:46.953 --> 15:48.682
- And afraid.
- Afraid?

15:49.622 --> 15:51.249
Don't scam a scam artist, darling.

15:51.891 --> 15:53.825
You're stalling 'cause you're scared.

15:58.097 --> 15:59.257
They gave false names,

15:59.499 --> 16:02.593
but later I learned
that the man's name was Henry.

16:02.835 --> 16:03.835
Henry Winchester?

16:04.904 --> 16:06.462
Never got a last name.

16:07.340 --> 16:09.501
- Okay, um, and the woman?
- Josie.

16:12.278 --> 16:14.337
- Did you know them?
- Yes, uh...

16:15.348 --> 16:17.509
Sort of.
It's complicated.

16:18.418 --> 16:19.418
I'm an ex-nun, sweetie.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.620
Complicated is my middle name.

16:24.357 --> 16:27.656
Now, w... what were they here
to investigate?

16:29.095 --> 16:30.528
Sister Mary Catherine.

16:31.264 --> 16:33.994
She killed two people before
jumping from the bell tower.

16:35.768 --> 16:40.603
So I took 'em to see Mother Superior
and sister Agnes.

16:57.690 --> 17:00.420
Time is of the essence,
Mother... Superior.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.222
The cardinal is meeting
with the holy father

17:02.462 --> 17:04.422
first thing in the morning,
and he wants a report.

17:22.714 --> 17:24.615
Our beloved abbey
is open to you, Father.

17:25.718 --> 17:27.709
Sister Julia here
will be your guide.

17:38.197 --> 17:39.397
Where would you like to begin?

17:39.632 --> 17:41.623
Sister Mary Catherine's
sleeping quarters, please.

17:46.139 --> 17:47.629
Sister Mary Catherine's room it is.

17:56.716 --> 17:57.716
I hate nuns.

17:58.184 --> 17:59.784
Why, because she answered me
and not you?

18:00.086 --> 18:01.644
No, because I went
to Catholic school

18:01.888 --> 18:03.208
and I have
a lot of pent-up anger.

18:03.356 --> 18:04.716
We have no time
for such pettiness.

18:05.091 --> 18:07.389
What's got your boxers
all in a bundle?

18:07.627 --> 18:09.151
This.
Why are we out in the field?

18:09.395 --> 18:10.919
It's called learning on the job.

18:11.164 --> 18:12.654
And you know damn well
this is the last assignment

18:12.899 --> 18:14.230
before we are full members.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.991
Therein lies the problem.

18:16.335 --> 18:18.997
As our initiation grows closer,
I...

18:19.238 --> 18:22.537
I worry that this might be
a selfish endeavor on my part.

18:22.775 --> 18:24.606
Selfish. How?

18:25.745 --> 18:29.340
If anything were to happen to me,
what of John? Millie?

18:29.582 --> 18:31.582
They'd be proud to know
that you answered the call.

18:31.818 --> 18:34.252
No. My wife would be a widow,
and my son fatherless.

18:34.487 --> 18:35.454
I don't expect you to understand.

18:35.688 --> 18:37.815
You don't have a fam...

18:40.426 --> 18:42.394
I'm sorry, Josie.
I didn't mean it that way.

18:43.196 --> 18:44.196
I know, Henry.

18:44.564 --> 18:46.404
You're a good man.
Millie is lucky to have you.

18:46.766 --> 18:49.462
Here we are.

18:54.874 --> 18:57.843
The... blood wouldn't come off.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.512
So, we're assuming demonic
possession here, correct?

19:06.452 --> 19:09.046
Or a linguist gone mad.

19:13.159 --> 19:14.524
It looks ancient.

19:14.894 --> 19:16.293
Zapoqra or Sanskrit?

19:16.662 --> 19:19.859
No. It's pre-Enochian.

19:20.132 --> 19:22.566
A crest of some sort.

19:23.703 --> 19:24.703
Kni...

19:25.104 --> 19:27.299
"Knights of Hell"?

19:29.809 --> 19:31.401
What is that?

19:32.912 --> 19:34.004
Trouble.

19:34.547 --> 19:37.948
Knights of Hell?
What were they doing there?

19:41.053 --> 19:43.544
I'm not sure
of anything I saw that night.

19:44.290 --> 19:45.814
We couldn't leave our room
after 10:00.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.151
Mother Superior forbade it.

20:30.836 --> 20:32.701
Stay still.

20:44.617 --> 20:48.075
I woke up in
a dark place, tied to a chair.

20:56.028 --> 20:57.028
There were others.

20:58.130 --> 20:59.995
They were taken.

21:27.059 --> 21:28.059
I was so scared.

21:28.494 --> 21:32.362
I prayed and prayed,
but God didn't answer my prayers.

21:33.132 --> 21:34.132
Henry and Josie did.

22:18.711 --> 22:20.110
Henry!

22:21.914 --> 22:23.674
You hunters are always
sticking your noses in

22:23.783 --> 22:24.977
where they don't belong.

22:26.085 --> 22:27.484
Hunters?

22:27.953 --> 22:29.420
Please.

22:29.955 --> 22:30.955
Then what are you?

22:32.258 --> 22:34.886
Quickly, dear, before this one pays
for your stubborness!

22:37.596 --> 22:38.620
We are preceptors...

22:40.366 --> 22:42.061
Beholders, chroniclers
of all that

22:42.168 --> 22:43.368
which man does not understand.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.401
A woman
amongst the Men of Letters?

22:46.739 --> 22:47.739
Yes.

22:51.644 --> 22:52.906
Well, ain't that a blast.

22:54.013 --> 22:55.878
You do know
what we're capable of, demon?

22:56.115 --> 22:58.413
Yes. I know what you think
you're capable of,

22:59.085 --> 23:00.485
but perhaps I should see
for myself.

23:01.821 --> 23:02.845
Wait.
What are you doing?

23:03.355 --> 23:07.985
I'm trading up from this bag of bones
to Mr. Dreamy here.

23:09.228 --> 23:13.028
Then I can study your kind real close.

23:16.202 --> 23:18.727
Don't, or I'll... -
Or what?

23:22.908 --> 23:25.638
Take me, not him.

23:29.782 --> 23:31.249
You're joking.

23:32.585 --> 23:33.882
I could be more useful to you.

23:35.488 --> 23:36.978
People underestimate a woman.

23:37.189 --> 23:40.750
No. That's not it.

23:43.996 --> 23:45.429
You love him.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.626
He loves you, too, you know.

23:51.270 --> 23:52.862
Like a sister.

23:55.574 --> 23:58.202
Please...

23:59.345 --> 24:02.007
Spare him.

24:02.448 --> 24:03.448
Take me.

24:05.384 --> 24:06.384
You have my permission.

24:07.119 --> 24:10.486
You've been very entertaining,
my dear.

24:11.157 --> 24:13.455
But I don't need your permission.

24:14.894 --> 24:17.362
Abaddon takes what she wants.

24:18.497 --> 24:23.230
And right now,
she wants everything.

24:43.556 --> 24:45.353
You're going to study
the Men of Letters?

24:46.325 --> 24:47.587
For a moment.

24:49.695 --> 24:51.595
And then I'll destroy them.

24:52.698 --> 24:53.960
And what of all this?

24:55.100 --> 24:56.499
Keep it going until I return.

24:57.803 --> 24:58.895
Now play dead.

25:05.144 --> 25:06.611
Henry!

25:09.782 --> 25:10.874
Are you okay?

25:12.751 --> 25:13.877
We did it.

25:14.954 --> 25:16.012
We stopped the demons.

25:23.863 --> 25:25.091
Abaddon.

25:26.131 --> 25:28.531
Did you ever see exactly what
she was doing down there?

25:29.101 --> 25:32.901
No, but whatever it was she was
doing at St. Bonaventure,

25:33.138 --> 25:34.662
it seems to be happening again.

25:35.841 --> 25:37.361
The convent's name
was St. Bonaventure?

25:37.409 --> 25:38.409
Yes.

25:46.652 --> 25:47.652
Where is it?

25:48.020 --> 25:49.248
On the outskirts of town.

25:50.055 --> 25:51.386
It's been closed for years.

25:58.998 --> 26:00.693
I love this. I really do.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.335
Couple of cold ones,
a kind jukebox...

26:03.836 --> 26:05.098
Good and evil, bro-in down.

26:05.337 --> 26:06.457
Shut your pie hole, Crowley.

26:06.605 --> 26:08.038
Yeah, you said that already.

26:08.274 --> 26:11.539
Look, I merely suggested
you might be a bit scared.

26:11.777 --> 26:13.472
Yeah. No, I heard you
the first time.

26:13.712 --> 26:15.646
You still don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

26:15.881 --> 26:19.647
I know that Cain gave you
his Mark for a reason.

26:20.219 --> 26:21.819
And I know that rather
than embracing it,

26:21.921 --> 26:24.719
rather than looking at it
as the gift that it is,

26:25.057 --> 26:27.252
you're sulking like
you lost your knuffle bunny.

26:27.626 --> 26:30.561
Why are you fighting
what you really are?

26:31.697 --> 26:33.062
I'm a hunter.

26:33.565 --> 26:35.533
Who's a chip
off the old Mark of Cain.

26:35.935 --> 26:39.666
No. When I kill,
I kill for a reason.

26:40.072 --> 26:41.437
I'm nothing like Cain.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.171
Nothing like...

26:44.810 --> 26:46.539
Who are you talking to?
I know you're not talking to me.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.076
- Eat me.
- I saw you.

26:48.447 --> 26:49.675
I saw the two of you together.

26:49.915 --> 26:52.577
Nothing like Cain?
What's in that bottle? Delusion?

26:52.985 --> 26:55.453
I'm really starting to worry
about you, Dean.

26:56.355 --> 26:58.195
Yeah, well, why don't you worry
about yourself?

26:58.290 --> 26:59.484
I will.

26:59.892 --> 27:02.360
'Cause like it or not,
we're in this together.

27:02.594 --> 27:04.687
Your problems, my problems...

27:04.964 --> 27:05.964
Our problems.

27:06.665 --> 27:08.132
Where you going now?

27:09.702 --> 27:11.101
I'm going to go water the lily.

27:11.370 --> 27:12.860
Care to cross streams?

27:13.939 --> 27:15.566
So serious.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.810
Next time, it'll be easier.

27:25.517 --> 27:26.814
That's it.

27:28.787 --> 27:30.186
Good.

27:30.723 --> 27:34.022
You'll get used to the feelings,
even welcome them.

28:03.055 --> 28:04.175
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:04.256 --> 28:05.587
Easy.
I know what you're thinking.

28:06.058 --> 28:07.355
I'm thinking I'd like
to take a leak, so move.

28:07.593 --> 28:11.222
I'm Dean Winchester.
And I know a hunter when I see one.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.960
You don't want to do
what you're about to do.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.328
- And why's that?
- Because you're packing a knife

28:17.469 --> 28:20.029
to a demon fight,
and you don't stand a chance.

28:22.408 --> 28:25.275
- Then I'll go down swinging.
- Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

28:25.611 --> 28:27.704
Any other day, I'd be right there
with you, brother. I would, okay?

28:27.946 --> 28:29.346
But you got to trust me
on this one.

28:29.581 --> 28:31.378
Or you could grow a pair
and come with.

28:31.717 --> 28:34.447
You ever taken on a demon before?

28:34.787 --> 28:35.845
Yeah.

28:36.188 --> 28:38.588
Well, trust me when I say
that when he's done with you,

28:38.924 --> 28:40.221
he's gonna go after your family.

28:40.793 --> 28:41.760
He's gonna go after your friends.

28:41.994 --> 28:43.655
Hell, he'll go after your prom date.

28:44.663 --> 28:46.460
So, if you want to do that,
if you want to damn anyone

28:46.698 --> 28:47.898
and everyone you've ever loved

28:48.133 --> 28:51.102
in the slightest chance that you
could win, then by all means, pal.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.695
You go right ahead.

29:00.746 --> 29:02.077
I got a kid sister.

29:03.415 --> 29:04.473
She don't deserve that.

29:06.418 --> 29:07.851
What's your name?

29:08.287 --> 29:10.255
Jake.

29:10.656 --> 29:11.748
Good to meet you, Jake.

29:13.492 --> 29:14.492
Thanks.

29:14.726 --> 29:16.193
I'll see you around.

29:28.740 --> 29:30.571
Come on.
We got to go.

30:15.287 --> 30:16.447
Demons don't take leaks.

30:16.955 --> 30:18.047
Next time you want to shoot up,

30:18.157 --> 30:19.886
why don't you find
a better excuse?

30:21.193 --> 30:22.592
Guilty as charged.

30:22.928 --> 30:24.361
What happened?
I thought you were cleaning up your act.

30:24.696 --> 30:25.696
Well, I was going to,

30:25.898 --> 30:27.661
but then after
very little soul-searching,

30:27.900 --> 30:29.527
I decided to embrace
my addiction.

30:30.469 --> 30:32.164
What about you?

30:33.272 --> 30:34.899
Takes a junkie to know a junkie.

30:36.241 --> 30:39.404
You just want to touch
that precious again, don't you?

30:41.880 --> 30:43.575
I want to kill Abaddon.

30:44.082 --> 30:45.379
That's what I want.

30:46.385 --> 30:48.825
So, whatever happens with the Blade,
I can't worry about that.

30:48.854 --> 30:51.152
Sure. Whatever you got
to tell yourself

30:51.390 --> 30:52.721
so you can sleep better at night.

30:53.058 --> 30:57.586
Look, what I want, what I fear,
none of that means squat.

30:58.564 --> 31:01.965
Because this is the one chance
that we have to kill Abaddon.

31:02.601 --> 31:05.661
So, I'm all in,
no matter what the consequences.

31:06.305 --> 31:07.897
So the plan remains the same?

31:08.207 --> 31:10.232
I find her, you bring the Blade.

31:12.077 --> 31:13.442
It's a date.

31:25.190 --> 31:27.249
For a second there,
I thought he made me.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.585
He has other things on his mind.

31:31.463 --> 31:33.223
But he did do
exactly what you said he would.

31:33.398 --> 31:34.398
He saved you.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.561
Of course he saved me.

31:36.802 --> 31:38.429
We're besties.

31:39.037 --> 31:42.200
And now he's ready.

33:05.090 --> 33:09.754
Souls are a very precious
and fragile thing.

33:11.029 --> 33:12.029
Break one of those,

33:12.230 --> 33:14.425
and them little buggers fly
right back home.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.725
We can't have that, now can we?

33:20.305 --> 33:21.738
So, after all these years...

33:22.674 --> 33:26.508
...you're still doing Abaddon's
dirty work, huh, Agnes?

33:26.745 --> 33:28.804
Would you believe
it's gotten even dirtier?

33:29.681 --> 33:31.615
Used to be folks believed
in the church.

33:32.351 --> 33:35.081
Heck, the way they would come
strolling in here,

33:35.320 --> 33:36.844
looking for God.

33:37.356 --> 33:40.621
It was like fish in a barrel, really.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.052
But times change.

33:43.328 --> 33:45.091
You can blame your perverts
for that.

33:45.697 --> 33:49.531
Now I'm riding shotgun in some
smelly van with a handyman

33:49.701 --> 33:52.602
and tricking any half-wit
I can lay my hands on.

33:53.004 --> 33:54.028
But it's worth it.

33:54.639 --> 33:55.639
Because...

33:56.241 --> 33:58.675
...stealing souls is so noble.

33:58.910 --> 34:00.605
Stealing souls is winning!

34:03.515 --> 34:04.515
Winning what?

34:05.650 --> 34:07.049
Hell's crown, nimrod.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.714
You think Abaddon
is just gonna sit there

34:09.955 --> 34:13.118
while those pantywaisted demons
refuse to pick a side?

34:14.493 --> 34:15.687
And so she made a plan...

34:15.927 --> 34:18.725
if you can't convince 'em,
make 'em.

34:24.668 --> 34:27.159
She's turning souls into demons?

34:27.472 --> 34:31.806
Hmm. A demon army, unbeatable,
loyal only to her.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.871
Well, uh...

34:34.212 --> 34:35.975
At this rate...

34:36.148 --> 34:37.708
Should only take
a couple million years.

34:37.815 --> 34:40.751
Have fun with that.

34:40.985 --> 34:43.716
You think
I'm the only one doing this?

34:45.157 --> 34:46.987
We have factories
spread throughout.

34:48.226 --> 34:50.284
Worry not, though.
Victory is nigh.

34:50.594 --> 34:52.688
And we'd like you to be
on our team.

34:53.297 --> 34:54.925
Recruitment is easy.

34:55.300 --> 34:58.633
I just have to rip your soul
out of your body.

35:01.807 --> 35:02.831
Please!

37:30.822 --> 37:32.813
You know, um,
can I ask you something?

37:34.059 --> 37:35.356
If it's for a date, I'm sorry.

37:35.594 --> 37:38.859
I never see anyone under 65.
Too much drama.

37:39.331 --> 37:42.266
Come on. Spit it out.

37:44.836 --> 37:46.736
After witnessing what you did...

37:48.139 --> 37:51.165
...why didn't you warn Henry
about Abaddon?

37:56.581 --> 38:00.711
I became a nun
because I wanted to help people.

38:01.119 --> 38:03.519
Make a difference.

38:04.122 --> 38:06.556
But they never prepare you.

38:07.926 --> 38:13.296
They never tell you how to act
in the face of true evil.

38:17.569 --> 38:19.594
Thank you, Sister.

38:20.839 --> 38:22.534
For the safety
of all those involved,

38:22.774 --> 38:27.177
it's important that we keep
what happened here today...

38:29.514 --> 38:31.209
...quiet.

38:32.250 --> 38:34.343
Of course.

38:45.296 --> 38:47.696
Soon after, I left the order.

38:48.199 --> 38:49.530
Why?

38:50.402 --> 38:52.461
Because I was ashamed.

38:53.004 --> 38:57.566
I had betrayed our flock,
God, myself.

38:58.743 --> 39:02.611
It was and still is my greatest shame.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.145
Well, what you shared with me
saved lives.

39:08.987 --> 39:11.683
And I couldn't have done that
without you.

39:13.258 --> 39:14.452
Take care.

39:14.959 --> 39:17.018
You too, Sam.

39:38.149 --> 39:39.639
You okay, Henry?

39:41.086 --> 39:42.713
Better.

39:43.455 --> 39:45.252
We saved lives today.

39:46.024 --> 39:47.753
We made a difference.

39:48.526 --> 39:50.926
- Hmm.
- This... our work...

39:52.764 --> 39:54.595
It's a noble calling, isn't it?

39:54.933 --> 39:57.993
I mean, yes, there's risk,
but, gosh.

39:58.737 --> 40:00.705
I feel the fool for doubting it
for even a second.

40:00.939 --> 40:01.939
Hmm.

40:03.541 --> 40:05.099
And you, Josie?

40:05.543 --> 40:07.511
Me?

40:08.646 --> 40:11.342
Well, I feel like a whole new person.

40:46.217 --> 40:47.377
Still plugging away?

40:48.186 --> 40:49.517
Like a dog with a bone.

40:50.054 --> 40:51.248
You?

41:08.206 --> 41:09.206
You were right.

41:11.376 --> 41:13.367
About what?

41:14.646 --> 41:16.910
Finding Abaddon ASAP.

41:19.484 --> 41:22.180
She's mining souls.

41:25.590 --> 41:26.590
Why?

41:27.225 --> 41:28.954
To create an army.
