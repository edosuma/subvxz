Roberta's mad at me.
Can you feel it?

00:11.613 --> 00:16.129
I'm not mad. I just wonder if this
is the most optimal use of your time...

00:16.332 --> 00:19.723
...since we're missing vital interface
with voters at Faneuil Hall.

00:19.893 --> 00:21.292

- Roberta.

We have plenty of time for all that.
We'll just be here 20 minutes.

We need to get to the harbor

00:28.853 --> 00:31.128
...which will have crews
from every local station.

- Cable news.
- Probably make the Globe, above the fold.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.811
- So 20 minutes, right?
- Yes, 20 minutes.

That's another thing.
Who the hell is Alan Shore?

SAMANTHA: Alan.

Hmm.

00:50.253 --> 00:52.369
Samantha Fleming, this is Tara Wilson.

TARA: Pleasure.

JACK: No.

Tax evasion.
Obstruction of justice.

01:35.613 --> 01:38.081

I see the damn thing.

02:05.013 --> 02:06.605
Jack was never convicted
of those charges.

02:06.773 --> 02:09.810
It was a third generation
family real-estate trust.

02:09.973 --> 02:11.645
He was a passive beneficiary.

02:11.813 --> 02:16.011
A victim of a trustee whose greed
got the trust prosecuted...

02:16.173 --> 02:20.007
...not Jack personally.
I know you can help us.

ALAN: Then my apologies.

02:39.413 --> 02:41.051
When you spoke about truth...

02:41.213 --> 02:44.444
...I mistook that as a preference
for full disclosure.

Then they put this on the air and
our polls dropped six points in 72 hours.

If we don't move fast, we're going
to lose. All because of this late hit.

You ached to feel her naked body
pressed up against yours.

03:20.893 --> 03:22.326
Yes. Well said.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.122
- And yet nothing ever happened?
- We suffered from bad timing.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.853
You're wondering if that's our destiny,
yours and mine.

03:29.013 --> 03:32.403
- Twenty years of unrequited foreplay.

- What were you two doing?
- Tai chi, actually.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.602
I hope it is clear that it would be
an unacceptable conflict of interest...

03:49.813 --> 03:53.044
...for you to represent
Jack Fleming in any matter.

03:53.213 --> 03:55.727
This firm is extremely close
to Mayor Snyder.

03:55.893 --> 04:00.364
Then this firm should take a shower.

a mental-status examination...

knows his own name?

- You are Dr. Thomas H. Lee, neurologist.

12:49.093 --> 12:50.890
...in all of those cases...

12:51.053 --> 12:53.965
...we absolutely would see
injunctive relief granted.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.044

to have the truth told about his life.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.773

the truth, Your Honor?

13:03.933 --> 13:07.130
Would Mr. Shore have us establish
a government department of veracity?

13:07.293 --> 13:10.842
Mr. Fleming already has a remedy
available. It's called a slander suit.

13:11.013 --> 13:14.289
I'm curious. When one wins a slander
suit, does the court award votes?

13:14.453 --> 13:17.490
That's the issue. They're trying
to cost him the election now...

13:17.653 --> 13:21.328

a few dollars years from now.

You were pretty insistent on the phone.

from a playdate, so...

Well, what I came to say,
it's simple, Marcy.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.570
I'm sick, and I need your help.

15:28.253 --> 15:31.848
I can't let you use Zach's cord blood.
I told you that when you called.

15:32.013 --> 15:35.972

himself? We saved it for a reason.

Do you have children, Miss Colson?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.451
No.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.451
You wanna protect Zach.
And I understand that.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.127
But how about protecting him
from losing his father?

15:51.293 --> 15:54.012
He's not gonna lose you.
You're strong. You'll beat this.

- They should keep trying.
- I'm running out of time!

Please don't yell at me.

16:13.213 --> 16:15.204
I'm sorry.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.203
I was thinking on the way over here
about the day Zach was born.

16:21.373 --> 16:22.772
And holding him.

16:22.933 --> 16:27.563

of some great continuum.

16:30.373 --> 16:36.289
It's stupid, but feeling as if I had
thrown my DNA forward into the future.

You know,
like some biological javelin.

16:40.813 --> 16:42.292
He's my flesh and blood, Marcy.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.927
I would never do anything
to put him at risk.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.092
I've read all the literature.

16:48.253 --> 16:53.327
The chances of Zach ever needing
to use this are about one in 2700.

16:55.493 --> 16:58.803
But I need it now...

16:58.973 --> 17:00.884
...to live.

Either of you.

I did. But please understand...

19:45.013 --> 19:47.243

should anticipate...

19:47.413 --> 19:51.406
...their safety instructions will be ignored

In retrospect, I can't imagine not,

would never, ever find out.

You should tell him.

- No. Now would be the worst time.

I would let him have it.
