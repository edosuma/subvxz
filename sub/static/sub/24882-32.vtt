00:15.133 --> 00:16.867
Hello.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.367
Today, "Sesame Street"
is all about karate.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.100
Yeah.
Me can use karate

00:21.166 --> 00:23.133
to chop this cookie
in half

00:23.200 --> 00:25.200
to share
with me friend, Prairie.

00:25.266 --> 00:26.300
But, Cookie Monster,

00:26.367 --> 00:28.266
karate is not
for cutting cookies.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.567
Cookie Monster: Hi-yah!

00:29.633 --> 00:32.333
But-- Ohh...

00:32.400 --> 00:33.500
You know, Prairie,

00:33.567 --> 00:35.166
karate not so good
for cutting cookies.

00:35.233 --> 00:36.200
No.

00:36.266 --> 00:37.500
Keep watching
to find out

00:37.567 --> 00:39.667
more about karate
on "Sesame Street."

00:39.734 --> 00:40.900
Here.
You want a crumb?

00:40.967 --> 00:42.600
No, I do not
want a crumb.

Zoe:
Oh, Abby,

01:16.600 --> 01:18.000
- this is gonna be so great.
- Abby: I know.

01:18.066 --> 01:19.100
- Abby: Today is the day.
- Zoe: Yeah. Ha ha ha!

01:19.166 --> 01:20.400
Oh, oh, oh.

01:20.467 --> 01:22.033
Good morning, class.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.600
Zoe and Abby:
Good morning, Sensei Nina.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.633
Oh, hi. Welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.500
You're just in time
for karate class.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.800
Did someone say karate?

01:32.867 --> 01:34.000
Oh, yes.

01:34.066 --> 01:35.166
Zoe and I
are learning

01:35.233 --> 01:37.100
all about karate today.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.867
Well, then you are
in luck because I,

01:39.934 --> 01:42.467
Grover,
am a karate expert.

01:42.533 --> 01:43.900
Ta-da.

01:43.967 --> 01:44.934
I can teach you

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
all you need
to know about karate.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.400
Oh, thanks, Grover,

01:48.467 --> 01:49.767
but we already have

01:49.834 --> 01:50.934
a very special teacher--

01:51.000 --> 01:53.367
Sensei Nina.

01:53.433 --> 01:54.400
That's right.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.667
In karate, a teacher
is called, "sensei."

01:56.734 --> 01:59.567
Well, if you insist,
Sensei Grover it is.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.266
I know all
the great karate moves.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.934
Hi-yah!

02:06.266 --> 02:08.500
Cool. Where did you
learn karate, Grover?

02:08.567 --> 02:09.533
- Zoe: Yeah.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.033
Why, watching a movie,
of course.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.266
A movie?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.266
Yes.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.133
"Monster Karate Master 3."

02:15.200 --> 02:17.400
Oh, I learned so much
from that movie.

02:17.467 --> 02:21.567
Oh, observe
as I karate-chop
this table.

02:23.734 --> 02:25.133
Hi-yah!

02:26.867 --> 02:28.700
Wow! Splitting a table
in two really smarts.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.467
Ah! Sorry
about the mess, Nina.

02:31.533 --> 02:32.500
I'll clean it up later.

02:32.567 --> 02:34.500
- What--
- I did not--

02:34.567 --> 02:36.467
Wait. Ohh...

02:36.533 --> 02:38.533
It looked so much easier
in the movie.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.467
Why don't you join
our class?

02:40.533 --> 02:41.767
See this ball, Grover?

02:41.834 --> 02:43.467
We're gonna learn
how to kick the ball

02:43.533 --> 02:45.900
off the stand using
a roundhouse kick.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.967
Grover: Oh, I already know
how to do that kick.

02:48.033 --> 02:51.567
I saw it in the movie.
Stand back, everyone.

02:51.633 --> 02:55.633
Mmm... Hi-yah!

02:55.700 --> 02:57.266
Grover:
Oh! Ow! Ohh...

02:57.333 --> 03:01.667
See? And the ball is...

03:01.734 --> 03:03.834
still there.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.033
Ohh, perhaps you
are right, Nina.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.934
Perhaps I cannot
learn karate

03:09.000 --> 03:11.200
from just watching
one karate movie.

03:11.266 --> 03:14.000
I know what I must do.

03:14.066 --> 03:16.266
Zoe and Abby:
Join our karate class?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.433
No. I must watch
two karate movies.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.000
Be right back.

03:20.066 --> 03:23.734
OK. Well,
let's get started.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.033
Are you ready
for your karate exercises?

03:26.100 --> 03:29.767
Zoe and Abby: Oh.
Ready, Sensei Nina.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.600
All right. First, we're
gonna exercise our legs

03:32.667 --> 03:34.233
and our ears.

03:35.433 --> 03:38.200
Our ears?
Don't joke, Big Nina.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.767
Ha ha ha! How can you
exercise your ears?

03:41.834 --> 03:44.600
Well, by listening carefully.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.333
In karate,
it's important to focus

03:46.400 --> 03:48.133
and to be a good listener.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.467
Oh. I'm a good listener.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.233
Yeah. Me, too.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.667
Well, you two are gonna
jump up and down

03:54.734 --> 03:56.233
until you hear me
blow the whistle.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.233
- Oh.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.800
Remember, listen carefully,

03:58.867 --> 04:00.967
and when you hear me
blow the whistle...

04:01.033 --> 04:02.533
Stop jumping.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.433
- Ha ha ha!

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
Zoe and Abby:
Got it, Sensei Nina.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.100
Good. All right-y,
then. Ready...

04:09.166 --> 04:10.533
- Zoe and Abby: Uh-huh.
- And jump!

04:10.600 --> 04:11.767
- OK. Jump.
- Ha ha ha!

04:11.834 --> 04:14.533
- I love jumping!
- Yeah. This is fun.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.500
- Ha ha ha!

04:16.567 --> 04:18.500
It's like playing
jump rope, right?

04:18.567 --> 04:19.767
Without the rope.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.667
- "Without the rope."

04:21.734 --> 04:23.934
Hello! You can
stop jumping now.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.500
But you didn't
blow the whistle,
Sensei Nina.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.533
Yeah.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.000
Oh, well, yes,
I did. Twice.

04:31.066 --> 04:33.567
Whoa. Uh...
we didn't hear you.

04:33.633 --> 04:36.467
Well, it is a little hard
to focus and listen

04:36.533 --> 04:38.166
when you're talking.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.667
- Abby and Zoe: Yes.

04:40.734 --> 04:43.133
- And this time, we won't talk.
- Mm-mm.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.500
OK. And you can try it,
too, if you want.

04:45.567 --> 04:48.834
All right, everybody?
Ready, and jump.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.567
OK.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.934
- Ah! We did it!
- We did it. Ha ha ha!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.934
We focused
and listened

04:58.000 --> 05:00.033
- and stopped at the whistle.
- Mm-hmm.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.967
- Yeah.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.934
Well, to do
a roundhouse kick,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.700
you need focus
and good balance.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.533
So, we're gonna
practice balancing.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.066
We're gonna stand
on one foot

05:12.133 --> 05:15.367
and keep our eye
on the ball.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.834
- OK.
- Oh, OK.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.133
Stand on one foot.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.934
And keep our eyes
on the ball.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.800
Now, touch your nose.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.633
- Uh, uh... uh...
- OK. Touching nose.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.433
Aah! Ha ha ha!

05:29.500 --> 05:31.734
- Oh, wow.
- Ha ha!

05:31.800 --> 05:33.867
Gee, touching
my nose made it

05:33.934 --> 05:35.934
so much harder
to balance.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.100
- Yeah, really hard.
- Yeah.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.066
I don't think
I could do it.

05:40.133 --> 05:42.367
With practice and focus,
you can do it.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.533
Oh, I don't know.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.867
Well, I say we
don't give up, Zoe.

05:46.934 --> 05:48.934
Well, then I'm
with you, Abby.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.800
- Let's try again.
- OK.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.266
- OK.
- Steady now.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.100
- Stand on one foot.
- One foot. Uh-huh.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.233
- OK.
- Eyes on the ball.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.867
- Nina: Steady.
- Let's touch our noses.

05:59.934 --> 06:01.433
Touching nose.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.700
- You got it.
- Zoe and Abby: Oh, we did it!

06:03.767 --> 06:06.133
- Ha ha ha!
- Yay!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.033
Are we ready
to try the kick now?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.767
Well, not yet. Remember,
it takes practice--

06:10.834 --> 06:15.500
Zoe and Abby:
Practice and focus
to learn karate.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.467
Right. Now,
your next exercise

06:17.533 --> 06:19.433
is the hardest yet.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.633
Well, we can handle it,
right, Abby?

06:22.700 --> 06:24.467
- Right.

06:24.533 --> 06:26.500
OK, so, in karate,

06:26.567 --> 06:28.734
you need to know
how to control your body

06:28.800 --> 06:30.033
and stay focused,

06:30.100 --> 06:31.467
no matter what
is happening around you.

06:31.533 --> 06:34.667
OK. So, let's stand
in a straight line.

06:34.734 --> 06:36.500
- All right. OK.
- OK.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.533
Nina: Good. Now,
look straight ahead.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.533
- OK.
- Mm-hmm.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.500
Nina: Stand very still
like a statue

06:41.567 --> 06:46.033
and don't move at all-- like,
not even a pinky finger, OK?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.667
- Zoe and Abby: Mm-hmm.
- Nina: All right.

06:47.734 --> 06:49.633
Nina: Remember, stand still,

06:49.700 --> 06:50.867
look straight ahead,

06:50.934 --> 06:54.066
and stay focused,
no matter what happens,

06:54.133 --> 06:57.800
even if a cute,
little puppy dog comes by.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.600
Abby: Puppy!

07:02.667 --> 07:05.567
Oh, Abby, look how cute
the little puppy is.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.934
Abby: That's a sweet,
little puppy. Who's a--

07:08.000 --> 07:10.233
- Zoe: Look at you.
- Abby: And he's so cute.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.233
- Zoe: Yes. Ha ha ha.
- Abby: He's just so fluffy.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.066
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.834
Zoe: Uh, we didn't keep
looking straight ahead.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.033
- No.
- No.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.533
Abby: No, and we didn't
stay still like statues.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.233
Mm-mm. This is called,
"the puppy test"

07:24.300 --> 07:26.700
because it's really
hard to stay focused

07:26.767 --> 07:28.333
when there's
a cute puppy around.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.367
- Yeah. We know.
- Yeah.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.100
Do you want
to try again?

07:31.166 --> 07:32.834
Um, well,
I don't know.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.633
Zoe, do you think
we can do it?

07:34.700 --> 07:36.033
I don't know.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.400
This puppy is awfully cute,

07:37.467 --> 07:38.533
and it's really hard

07:38.600 --> 07:40.700
not to look at it
and play with it.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.033
Abby: Oh, I know. I--
I have an idea.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.433
What?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.333
Abby: Well, what if we
imagined that the puppy

07:46.400 --> 07:48.300
wasn't so cute
and fluffy?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.734
Let's imagine
it were a doorknob.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.567
That's great.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.367
A doorknob is not that cute.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.266
We can do this.
- Yes.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.600
Let's line up.

07:57.667 --> 08:00.700
- OK. Look straight ahead.
- Yeah.

08:00.767 --> 08:02.567
Nina: Stand very still
like statues.

08:02.633 --> 08:03.567
Mm-hmm.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.900
No matter what happens,
stay focused...

08:06.967 --> 08:10.967
even if a cute,
little puppy dog comes by.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.500
- Door...
- Knob...

08:12.567 --> 08:13.767
- Door...
- Knob...

08:13.834 --> 08:15.500
- Door...
- Knob...

08:15.567 --> 08:17.000
- Door...
- Knob...

08:17.066 --> 08:18.667
- Door...
- Knob...

08:18.734 --> 08:20.033
- Door...
- Knob...

08:20.100 --> 08:21.867
- Door...
- You did it.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.467
- Ahh! We did it.
- We made it.

08:24.533 --> 08:27.033
- We did it...
- Oh, yes. Ha ha ha!

08:27.100 --> 08:29.100
'Cause imagining
a doorknob worked.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.500
- Yes. Yes.
- We did it.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.934
Yeah. You did
all the exercises.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Now, it's time for the kick.

08:34.066 --> 08:37.333
And I am ready
for the kick, too.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.433
Watch out, ball.
Here I come.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.734
Hi-yah! Oh!

08:44.800 --> 08:48.233
Ohh...
Did I kick the ball?

08:49.533 --> 08:50.734
Nope.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.567
Ohh! But I watched
two whole karate movies!

08:54.633 --> 08:56.100
Grover, you can't learn karate

08:56.166 --> 08:57.133
by watching a movie.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.700
Ah, I guess you are right.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.300
Watch me.
I focus on the ball.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.734
I find my balance and kick.

09:07.266 --> 09:08.800
All right. Now your turn, Abby.

09:08.867 --> 09:12.800
OK, so, focus
on the ball and listen.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.667
When you hear the whistle,
kick the ball.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.033
- Abby: OK.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.900
Yeah. Well, um,
focus on the ball.

09:18.967 --> 09:19.934
- Um, uh--

09:21.867 --> 09:22.934
Aah! Yaah!

09:23.000 --> 09:26.166
Ha ha ha! I did it!

09:26.233 --> 09:28.900
Nice kick. All right.
Now, it's your turn, Zoe.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.500
OK.

09:30.567 --> 09:34.600
OK. Now remember,
focus on the ball.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.500
Listen for the whistle and kick.

09:36.567 --> 09:39.700
- OK.

09:39.767 --> 09:42.734
- Mm-hmm.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.367
Oh! I did it!

09:44.433 --> 09:45.533
- Ha ha ha!
- Nice.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.033
Zoe and Abby:
We did it! We did it! We did it!

09:48.100 --> 09:50.000
- Ha ha ha! Oh.
- Ha ha! Oh. Uh...

09:50.066 --> 09:53.433
Abby and Zoe:
Thank you, Sensei Nina.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.800
That was amazing.
How did you do that?

09:56.867 --> 09:59.767
We learned how
to practice and focus

09:59.834 --> 10:02.300
in Sensei Nina's
karate class.

10:02.367 --> 10:04.033
Well, gee, do you think

10:04.100 --> 10:06.934
I could learn how
to do those things,
too, Nina?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.066
Of course! But...

10:09.133 --> 10:10.266
karate class is over for today.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.433
I got to go to work.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.400
Oh, no.
I missed my chance?

10:14.467 --> 10:18.066
Now I will never learn
all those amazing skills.

10:18.133 --> 10:21.000
Oh, woe is me. Ohh!

10:21.066 --> 10:22.166
- Oh, dear.
- Uh, hey--

10:22.233 --> 10:24.266
Oh, now I am
inconsolable.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.166
But, Grover,
I'm sure Zoe and I

10:27.233 --> 10:29.734
could teach you
what Nina taught us.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.834
What
Could you

10:32.900 --> 10:34.934
- Oh, sure.
- Oh!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.967
Well, first, you need
to exercise your legs.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.166
- Oh, yeah.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.967

Well, it's...

18:36.467 --> 18:38.767
zero! Ha ha.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.266
That means it's nothing.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.467
Zero is nothing-- zip, nada.

18:42.533 --> 18:44.667
Ha ha! So try
counting that, Count.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.734
All right, Oscar, I will.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.033
Hmm. Ah!

18:50.100 --> 18:53.066
How many horns do you
have on your head?

18:53.133 --> 18:54.166
What?

18:54.233 --> 18:57.233
Horns? None!

18:57.300 --> 19:01.166
That's zero horns
on Oscar's head.

19:01.233 --> 19:05.266
And, uh, how many bananas
do you see on that tree?

19:05.333 --> 19:06.734
- Mm-hmm.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.100
That--that's not
a banana tree.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.367
There's no bananas.
There's none!

19:11.433 --> 19:13.900
That's zero bananas
on that tree. Yes.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.767
What? Wait. No.
That's not what I--

19:15.834 --> 19:19.633
And, how many dancing ducks
do you see going by, hmm?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.734
None. Now stop counting.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.000
That's zero dancing ducks.

19:24.066 --> 19:27.100
- I love it!
- Oh, listen. I said stop!

19:27.166 --> 19:28.467
OK, Oscar.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.600
How many more times
do you want me

19:30.667 --> 19:31.600
to count zero?

19:31.667 --> 19:32.967
None!

19:33.033 --> 19:35.934
That's zero more times
Oscar wants

19:36.000 --> 19:37.400
to hear me count zero.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.033
Aah!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.967
Oscar?

19:44.033 --> 19:45.266
How many more times

19:45.333 --> 19:46.433
are you going
to come back up

19:46.500 --> 19:49.033
so that I can see
your smiling face, hmm?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.367
Oscar: None!
And I'm not smiling.

19:51.433 --> 19:54.333
That's zero times
that Oscar is coming back up

19:54.400 --> 19:56.233
and zero smiles. Hee!

19:56.300 --> 19:57.533
Ugh...

19:57.600 --> 20:00.834
Counting zero can be
so much fun. Hmm.

20:04.433 --> 20:06.600
That's zero zeros.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.934

Welcome to Elmo's World!

20:32.200 --> 20:36.600
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.767
Wait for it.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.266
Wait for it!

20:41.333 --> 20:45.066
Oh! Oh, ho ho!
Karate. Oh, look.

20:45.133 --> 20:48.433
Ernie and Bert
are doing karate.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.800
Oh, boy, Elmo loves karate

20:51.867 --> 20:54.800
and wants to find out
more about it.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.467
Oh, let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

20:57.533 --> 20:59.433
Let's call her together.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.867
Elmo and kids:
Oh, Smartie!

21:02.934 --> 21:04.467
Ha ha ha! Oh.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.567
Hi-yah!

21:06.633 --> 21:07.834
Oh, hi, Smartie.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.800
Hiya, Elmo. Sorry.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.633
I was just practicing
some karate.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.400
Oh, ho ho! Prac--
Yeah. Right. OK.

21:15.467 --> 21:18.367
Well, that's perfect, Smartie,
because Elmo wants to learn

21:18.433 --> 21:20.367
all about karate.

21:20.433 --> 21:23.100
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:23.166 --> 21:26.800
All:
We look it up.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.734
Mastering karate.
Here we go.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.700
Karate is an exercise from Japan

21:32.767 --> 21:35.200
done all around the world.

21:35.266 --> 21:39.600
Karate is practiced
in places called dojos.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.233
The sensei is a special teacher

21:41.300 --> 21:44.400
who shows students
how to do karate.

21:44.467 --> 21:48.600
Students are taught to bow
and show respect for others.

21:48.667 --> 21:52.200
They learn how to focus
and control their bodies.

21:52.266 --> 21:55.867
Karate also builds strength
and flexibility.

21:55.934 --> 21:58.400
As students get better
and better at karate,

21:58.467 --> 22:00.433
they are given
different color belts.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.767
Keep up the good work, everyone.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.900
Wow.

22:04.967 --> 22:08.100
That was a great way
to... kick off

22:08.166 --> 22:10.233
learning about karate, Smartie.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.100
I'm glad it was such a hit.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.633
Oh, ho ho!

22:13.700 --> 22:15.934
Smartie: Well, time
for karate practice.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.066
See you later,
Elmo. Bye-yah!

22:18.133 --> 22:21.033
Ha ha ha! Oh,
thank you, Smartie.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.767
Bye-bye.

22:22.834 --> 22:26.000
Boy, karate is so cool.

22:26.066 --> 22:29.934
Hey, that gives Elmo an idea.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.467
Oh, let's play
a game together.

22:32.533 --> 22:34.967
Yeah. Come on, come on.

22:42.233 --> 22:43.533
Elmo:
Let's help Maddie get dressed

22:43.600 --> 22:45.033
for her karate lesson.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.533
Does Maddie wear this
to karate?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.834
Girl:
No. That's a party hat.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.667
Elmo:
Oh, right.

22:51.734 --> 22:54.100
That's for birthday parties,
not karate.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.066
What about these pants?

22:57.133 --> 22:58.900
- Kids: Yes.
- Kid: That's right.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.967
What's next?
What about this?

23:02.033 --> 23:05.266
Girl: That's right.
The karate jacket.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.734
Elmo: Wow. Is Maddie all set
for karate now?

23:08.800 --> 23:11.000
Girl:
No. She needs her belt.

23:11.066 --> 23:14.133
Oh, of course. We did it.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.200
Elmo:
Maddie is in her karate gi.

23:16.266 --> 23:19.266
Boy, Elmo loves karate,

23:19.333 --> 23:22.934
and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.133
Does Mr. Noodle know
how to do karate?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.800
Oh, let's ask him. Ho ho ho!

23:28.867 --> 23:32.367
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:32.433 --> 23:35.500
- Oh, ho ho ho! Hi, Mr. Noodle.
- Kid: Mr. Noodle.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.800
Mr. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering,

23:37.867 --> 23:40.867
do you know how
to do karate?

23:40.934 --> 23:42.433
Elmo:
You do

23:42.500 --> 23:45.166
Oh, show us some moves,
Mr. Noodle.

23:45.233 --> 23:47.433
Boy:
He's hopping like a bunny.

23:47.500 --> 23:51.233
Elmo: Mr. Noodle,
that's a bunny and a carrot,

23:51.300 --> 23:53.233
not karate.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.467
OK. Elmo's gonna
give you a hint, OK?

23:55.533 --> 24:00.367
You use your hands
and feet when doing karate.

24:00.433 --> 24:01.867
Wait a minute...

24:01.934 --> 24:05.600
Mr. Noodle is dressed
like a painter?

24:05.667 --> 24:08.767
Girl: He's using his hands
and feet to paint.

24:08.834 --> 24:11.367
Elmo:
Is that karate, Mr. Noodle?

24:11.433 --> 24:12.867
Girl: It's not.

24:12.934 --> 24:14.200
Kids:
That's painting.

24:14.266 --> 24:16.567
Elmo:
That's not karate. No.

24:16.633 --> 24:20.400
In karate, you use you hands
and feet to do exercises.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.066
Oh, well, that's OK,
Mr. Noodle.

24:25.133 --> 24:27.367
You tried your best.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.800
Girl:
Wow! He did it.

24:29.867 --> 24:33.934
Elmo: Hey, hey, hey!
You did it, Mr. Noodle.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.233
Thank you for showing us
your karate moves, Mr. Noodle.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.500
Bye-bye.

24:38.567 --> 24:43.233
Boy, learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,

24:43.300 --> 24:45.200
