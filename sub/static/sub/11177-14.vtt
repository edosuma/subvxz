00:30.818 --> 00:33.719
<i>Unfortunately, he discovered too late...</i>

<i>that</i> "hermano"
<i>in Spanish meant "brother,"</i>

00:36.724 --> 00:41.593

<i>This was distracting Michael the next day when</i>

Look, there is nothing to it.
It's an arraignment.

However, it would help if you all showed up...

- Ten minutes, tops.

01:12.994 --> 01:16.987
<i>What the hell is going on? I'm waiting to</i>
<i>hear about Marta and this Hermano guy.</i>

01:17.098 --> 01:19.589
Yeah, I checked it out.
I do not think that she's cheating.

- { Gob] I'm going over to Marta's.
- No, no, no. Don't do that, okay?

just lay low, be cool
and I'll talk to her again.

01:25.706 --> 01:28.800
- That way you won't look so desperate, you know?
- You're a good guy, <i>mon fr√®re.</i>

01:28.909 --> 01:30.877
That means "brother" in French.

01:30.978 --> 01:34.345

I took four years of Spanish.

01:39.820 --> 01:42.653
- I owe you an apology.
- No, I owe you an apology.

01:42.757 --> 01:46.386
I'm so ashamed that
I was so disrespectful to your brother.

01:46.494 --> 01:48.894
Oh, who cares?
Nobody respects him.

01:48.996 --> 01:52.625
You see, Marta, I have been interested
in you since the first day that we met.

01:52.733 --> 01:56.134
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:56.237 --> 01:58.535
It doesn't matter.

01:58.639 --> 02:02.166
We live by a code, you and l...
to honor family.

02:02.276 --> 02:06.940
Yes. That's one of the things that attracted
me to you... your sense of right and wrong.

02:07.048 --> 02:09.312
I also like your hair
and your face and your breasts.

02:09.417 --> 02:11.885
- You're so unlike your brother.
- Oh, thank you.

02:11.986 --> 02:16.320
- Gob is like the cock of the walk. But not you.
- You are so kind.

02:16.424 --> 02:19.985
- You're sensitive, like a woman.
- That's enough.

02:20.094 --> 02:22.324
We do have to do
the right thing.

02:22.430 --> 02:26.730
- And being together is the wrong thing.
- Very, very...

02:26.834 --> 02:28.734
wrong.

- Please.

02:57.031 --> 02:59.829
Oh!

02:59.934 --> 03:03.802
- Gob's wand.
- Oh, this... this is so wrong.

03:03.904 --> 03:07.704
- Yes.
- No, no, no. Not-Not-Not... Not... Not hot wrong.

03:07.808 --> 03:12.939
- You know, regular wrong. I gotta tell Gob.
- No, I have to tell him.

03:13.047 --> 03:17.074
Yes, but you speak a little slowly, and I
really want to get this thing moving along.

03:17.184 --> 03:20.381
So, listen, you do the noble thing, and you
tell him that you've met somebody else.

03:20.488 --> 03:23.548
I'm gonna do the noble thing
and tell him that it's me.

03:23.657 --> 03:26.717
While I'm doing my noble thing you could put
those photos in a box, get rid of the wand...

03:26.827 --> 03:29.762

the right way.

Hello, Maeby.

03:50.518 --> 03:53.749

Was Maeby adopted?
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

<i>So he set about doing some</i>

04:16.610 --> 04:20.046
- Hey, have you ever seen any
pictures of your mom pregnant?
- Don't talk to me about my mom.

04:20.147 --> 04:22.308
She's crazy.
Both of them are.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.442
- Sometimes I wish we weren't even related.
- <i>Hey, you know, maybe we're not.</i>

04:25.553 --> 04:28.113
Because, I mean, when you think about it,
we don't even really look like each other.

04:28.222 --> 04:30.952
No, I was talking
about my parents.

04:31.058 --> 04:33.492

with this family?

04:34.695 --> 04:37.255
Maybe we're not a family.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.079
Oh, no? Why not?

05:02.189 --> 05:06.717
- Because of you. You said to lay low.
And it's working.
- Great.

Tell you what, you may not be good with women,
but you are great with other people's women.

- I'll give you that.
- { Chuckles] No! Listen, Gob,
you can't just ignore her.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.167
Maybe you <i>should</i> talk to her.
She is your girlfriend.

Exactly. And I want
to keep it that way.

- Hey, Buster.
- Gob, there's no need for violence.

05:37.825 --> 05:42.194
<i>There never is. I'd like to think</i>
<i>that we're all intelligent, mature...</i>

05:42.296 --> 05:44.958

their differences...

05:45.065 --> 05:47.932
whenever they might come to light,
through words.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.265
Yeah, well, I let my fists
do the talking.

05:50.371 --> 05:52.999
Not this one, 'cause obviously,
I need it for coin tricks and stuff.

- But this one, I let it speak for both of them.
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

05:56.310 --> 06:00.007
Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball
and remain motionless when confronted.

06:00.114 --> 06:02.446
That's what I did in high school
when I almost got into a fight.

06:02.549 --> 06:06.041
- I think that was about being attacked by bears.
- Yeah, I know.

06:07.554 --> 06:10.022
Hey, rich kid.
Gimme your lunch money.

06:12.526 --> 06:16.553
But sometimes I wonder what it would be like
to get into a fight today.

06:16.664 --> 06:20.657
- You'd be a much bigger ball.
- There is so much in life
that I have not experienced.

06:20.768 --> 06:24.260
And now that I'm away from Mom,
I feel like this is my chance to live.

06:24.371 --> 06:28.467
I want to dance. I want to make love
to a woman. I want to get a checking account.

06:28.575 --> 06:31.510

it feels like to get my face socked in.

- { Buster] I'm not here.
- Is that Buster? Tell him I'm fine without him.

06:43.223 --> 06:46.624
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm worried about your father's hearing.

06:46.727 --> 06:49.195
Mom, listen, it's gonna be fine.
I'm on it, okay? I'm taking care of it.

06:49.296 --> 06:53.096
- I'll be there first thing Friday morning.
- It's tomorrow at 4:30.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.136
- Oh. I should write that down.
- Where is your head, Michael?

06:57.237 --> 06:59.467
Everything's gonna be fine.
They just read the charges...

06:59.573 --> 07:01.803

like, six minutes.

07:01.909 --> 07:04.844
- Ten minutes.
- We couldn't get that down, huh?

07:04.945 --> 07:08.142
<i>[Narrator] George Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>went to speak with Tobias.</i>

07:08.248 --> 07:11.046
- This was just faxed to you.
- Oh, great! The rewrite.

07:11.151 --> 07:13.278
Let's see if they've
beefed up my part.

07:13.387 --> 07:15.617
I got three lines!

07:15.723 --> 07:20.456
So, uh, I've been thinking about that, uh... that
conversation we were having the other night...

07:20.561 --> 07:23.052
about, uh, where Maeby
came from, and, uh...

07:23.163 --> 07:25.825
I was just wondering if
you could finish that thought.

07:25.933 --> 07:28.458
Yes, okay.
Uh, well, have a seat.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.470
Uh...

07:32.806 --> 07:34.774
Um...

07:36.276 --> 07:38.870
When a man...

07:38.979 --> 07:44.508
needs to prove to a woman
that he's actually...

07:44.618 --> 07:46.711
When a man loves a woman...

07:46.820 --> 07:51.189
and he actually wants
to make love, uh, to her...

07:51.291 --> 07:54.488
something very,
very special happens.

07:54.595 --> 07:57.928
And, uh, with deep,
deep concentration...

07:58.032 --> 08:02.366
- and-and great focus,
he's often able to achieve an erec...
- I'm sorry.

08:02.469 --> 08:04.835
I'm gonna stop you.
I know where you're running.

08:04.938 --> 08:07.202
l-I didn't mean
babies in general.

08:07.307 --> 08:13.041
Oh, well, that's good,
'cause it was about to get a little, ick, gross.

08:13.147 --> 08:16.742
- Yeah. No, I meant specifically with Maeby.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.750
- This isn't right.
- I know. You're right.

08:18.852 --> 08:21.047
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It says it's a shower scene.

08:21.155 --> 08:24.647
I'm not supposed to be in a shower scene.
It has nudity.

08:24.758 --> 08:28.717
<i>[Narrator] Tobias was a never-nude,</i>
<i>which is exactly what it sounds like.</i>

08:28.829 --> 08:32.663
I don't do nudity.
It says that right on my r√©sum√©. Okay?

08:32.765 --> 08:35.256
What... What do you think
I wear these for?

08:35.369 --> 08:37.769
I was never actually
clear on that.

08:37.871 --> 08:40.897
So, you're, uh...
you're not with Marta anymore?

08:41.008 --> 08:45.638
Well, my plan is to get her wanting me
but bad, and then I spring it on her.

08:45.746 --> 08:49.375
I know you've been cheating on me,
and you just cost yourself one fine man...

08:49.483 --> 08:54.147
- and one fine CD of him singing
"Love is in the Air."
- Well, I would never, uh...

08:54.254 --> 08:57.348
do this while you were
still going out, but, uh...

08:57.458 --> 09:00.723
if you're done with her,
I'd sure like a crack at her.

09:00.828 --> 09:03.922
{ Chuckling] Right, right.
That sounds great. Go for it, buddy.

09:04.031 --> 09:06.966
But you know that she's kind of
used to being with me, right?

09:07.067 --> 09:11.128
So, it'd be sort of like
going from prime rib to...

09:11.238 --> 09:14.571
I don't know...
weird brother of prime rib.

09:14.675 --> 09:17.644
- Do you even know her?
- I met her. I fell for her.

09:17.744 --> 09:23.410
I've been watching her program, El Amor
Prohibido... <i>The Love That Is Forbidden.</i>

09:23.517 --> 09:25.781
<i>She</i> is the love that's forbidden.

09:25.886 --> 09:28.184
The love of my <i>hermano.</i>

09:28.288 --> 09:31.018
Wait a second. What?
You know Hermano?

09:31.125 --> 09:36.290
<i>"Hermano"</i> is brother in Spanish.
As in, "Hey, <i>hermano."</i>

- Brother?

- <i>Hermano</i> means brother?
- Yeah.

09:46.707 --> 09:49.505

Uh, so, are you gonna hit me?

10:02.422 --> 10:06.620
No, I'm not gonna hit you. You're not
the brother Marta's cheating on me with.

10:06.727 --> 10:10.322
- Oh. Oh, who is?
- How the hell should I know, Buster?

10:10.430 --> 10:14.298
You know, there is a guy who plays
her older brother on her show.

10:14.401 --> 10:16.699
I think his name is Tio.

10:16.803 --> 10:18.794
Tio.

10:18.906 --> 10:22.865
Well, sounds like someone who you
think's name is Tio...

10:22.976 --> 10:25.444
is about to get his ass kicked.

10:25.546 --> 10:28.811
Thanks for the tip, Buster.

10:28.916 --> 10:32.875
All right, Mom. I'll be sure to tell Buster.
Right. Bye. Mom wanted me to tell you...

10:32.986 --> 10:35.546
that she doesn't care whether you live or die,
but if you're not dead...

10:35.656 --> 10:37.817
she would like to see you at the courthouse
tomorrow in the blue sweater.

10:37.925 --> 10:40.985
- Damn! I hate the blue sweater.
- She said it would look nice with the gray pants.

10:41.094 --> 10:43.562
- Damn it! She's right!
- Where's Gob?

10:43.664 --> 10:47.498
- I think he's heading down to the set
of Marta's soap opera.
- What?

10:47.601 --> 10:50.593
Get this: She may be cheating on him
with the guy who plays her brother.

10:50.704 --> 10:53.229
I mean, I still like her,
but we're gonna have to deal with this.

10:53.340 --> 10:56.275
- I gotta go stop him.
- And I've got a blue sweater to steam.

10:56.376 --> 10:58.207
