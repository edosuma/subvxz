* As we gather
'round the table *

55:23.320 --> 55:26.824
* To say a prayer
for those we love *

55:26.857 --> 55:32.463
* All the words that will
be spoken will never be enough *

55:32.497 --> 55:35.666
* To encompass
all the feelings *

55:35.700 --> 55:38.636
* That our brittle hearts
can bear *

55:38.669 --> 55:41.906
* All the storms
that rage inside us *

55:41.939 --> 55:45.142
* Fill our organs up with air

55:45.175 --> 55:48.078
* That our trouble's
never over *

55:48.112 --> 55:50.915
* And work our work
is never done *

55:50.948 --> 55:54.318
* But with
the turning of the season *

55:54.351 --> 55:57.321
* We will always see the sun

55:57.354 --> 56:00.257
* And the sound it makes

56:00.290 --> 56:03.494
* Is an honest song

56:03.528 --> 56:06.731
* Our hearts sing
an honest song *
