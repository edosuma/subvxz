WEBVTT

00:00.579 --> 00:02.312
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.314 --> 00:03.927
I guess I'm still wondering

00:03.929 --> 00:05.795
if Emily and I
are right for each other.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.164
Does this have to do with
that girl you had coffee with?

00:08.166 --> 00:11.167
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about?

00:11.169 --> 00:13.503
Who can say?

00:13.505 --> 00:16.639
I need to come up with
a big idea to make some money.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.608
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.043
You and Sheldon already came up

00:20.045 --> 00:21.845
with your
superfluid helium model.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.046
That's just research.

00:23.048 --> 00:24.814
We're never going
to make any money from it.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.783
Forget helium--
the real superfluid

00:26.785 --> 00:29.018
is the fruit punch in this mug.

00:29.020 --> 00:33.122
It reminds me of my daddy's
secret “Don't Tell Mama” juice.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.025
Maybe that's an idea.

00:36.027 --> 00:38.761
Guidance systems
for drunk people.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.930
They have that,
it's called Uber.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.200
Hey, in your supercooled
helium experiments,

00:44.202 --> 00:46.636
did you create
quantum vortices?

00:46.638 --> 00:47.637
Yeah, why?

00:47.639 --> 00:49.072
Well, if you made
a guidance system,

00:49.074 --> 00:51.407
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

00:51.409 --> 00:53.843
Wow. Never thought about that.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.612
And, since it's
in a quantum state,

00:55.614 --> 00:57.113
it would maintain
an infinite persistence.

00:57.115 --> 00:58.281
Groundbreaking
revelations,

00:58.283 --> 00:59.849
tropical drinks.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.720
Tell me this isn't like the best
episode of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:11.661
Okay, I gotta ask--

01:11.663 --> 01:13.429
why are you wearing
a bow tie?

01:13.431 --> 01:16.366
I've never applied
for a patent before.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.201
I wanted to make
a good impression.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.471
Oh. Is the impression that
your first name is Pee-Wee?

01:21.473 --> 01:23.640
(chuckling)

01:26.611 --> 01:29.212
Yeah, well, you're an engineer.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.813
End of joke, burn.

01:33.652 --> 01:34.884
Come on in, fellas.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.886
See, he's not wearing a tie.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.121
Well, he's
a patent attorney.

01:38.123 --> 01:39.989
Maybe his tie is pending.

01:41.159 --> 01:43.326
So, I've reviewed
your paperwork,

01:43.328 --> 01:45.628
and it seems like
we've got everything we need

01:45.630 --> 01:46.696
to file a patent

01:46.698 --> 01:48.731
for your infinite
persistence gyroscope.

01:48.733 --> 01:49.832
That's great!
Excellent.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.200
So what happens next?

01:51.202 --> 01:52.669
Well, the legal team
needs to review

01:52.671 --> 01:54.604
existing patents
to avoid overlap.

01:54.606 --> 01:56.105
Oh, I don't think
there will be.

01:56.107 --> 01:57.607
Yes, we did
our own search.

01:57.609 --> 02:00.910
That's nice, but I think ours
might be a bit more thorough.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.647
(chuckles):
Get a load of this guy.

02:04.649 --> 02:07.016
Can you imagine if we
make money with this?

02:07.018 --> 02:08.584
If we do,
I am splurging

02:08.586 --> 02:11.321
on the best sinus irrigator
money can buy.

02:12.857 --> 02:14.023
That old sad story--

02:14.025 --> 02:17.060
guy gets a little money,
goes straight up his nose.

02:17.062 --> 02:20.797
Just need you to review
and sign this document

02:20.799 --> 02:22.932
acknowledging that you
understand the university

02:22.934 --> 02:25.802
will own 75% of the patent.

02:26.905 --> 02:29.172
75%?

02:29.174 --> 02:30.306
That's outrageous.

02:30.308 --> 02:33.109
This is our idea
based on our research.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.279
How can you possibly justify
owning a majority share?

02:36.281 --> 02:37.747
It's university policy.

02:37.749 --> 02:40.016
I know when I'm beat.

02:40.018 --> 02:42.385
Hold on, hold on.
So the three of us

02:42.387 --> 02:45.888
do all the work
and only end up with 25%?

02:45.890 --> 02:47.857
Dr. Hofstadter, this university

02:47.859 --> 02:49.792
has been paying your salaries
for over ten years.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.495
Did you think we do that out
of the goodness of our hearts?

02:52.497 --> 02:56.299
Well, until you just said
that mean thing, kinda.

02:57.435 --> 02:59.469
And as far as
Mr. Wolowitz is concerned,

02:59.471 --> 03:02.705
I'm afraid as a federal employee
on loan from NASA,

03:02.707 --> 03:04.474
your name can be
on the patent,

03:04.476 --> 03:07.877
but you're not entitled
to an ownership share.

03:07.879 --> 03:10.146
Wait, so this can turn out to be

03:10.148 --> 03:13.316
a financial success,
and I get nothing?

03:13.318 --> 03:17.220
Well, sometimes
they give you a plaque.

03:17.222 --> 03:18.721
Well, that's not fair.

03:18.723 --> 03:20.790
We should all get plaques.

03:23.261 --> 03:24.927
Sorry, but we
can't sign this.

03:24.929 --> 03:26.596
Come on, let's go.

03:26.598 --> 03:28.531
Thank you for your time.

03:31.269 --> 03:33.703

04:04.376 --> 04:06.943
So, have you been having
any morning sickness?

04:06.945 --> 04:08.311
A little.

04:08.313 --> 04:09.512
And it doesn't help

04:09.514 --> 04:10.780
that I've got this heightened
sense of smell.

04:10.782 --> 04:13.216
Is that a pregnancy thing?
Yeah.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.350
The other day I sniffed out

04:14.352 --> 04:17.086
where Howie
hid the Girl Scout cookies.

04:18.089 --> 04:22.492
No more Tagalongs, my ass.

04:22.494 --> 04:23.893
But now you'll be able to make

04:23.895 --> 04:26.930
your own milk
to eat the cookies with.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.999
Hey, guys. Hey, Penny.

04:30.001 --> 04:31.935
I really appreciate
you helping me with this.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.269
I don't know what to do.

04:33.271 --> 04:35.171
Oh, sure. Let me see it.
See what?

04:35.173 --> 04:37.240
I hadn't spoken to Emily
since I broke up with her,

04:37.242 --> 04:39.409
and she left this
on my doorstep with a note.

04:39.411 --> 04:42.912
“Raj, I got you this before we
split up, but couldn't return it

04:42.914 --> 04:44.614
“and thought
you'd like to have it.

04:44.616 --> 04:46.783
Happy belated
Valentine's Day, Emily”"

04:46.785 --> 04:48.184
That's nice.

04:48.186 --> 04:50.219
Nice, or is she trying
to manipulate him?

04:50.221 --> 04:52.789
I know. I mean, do I open it?
Do I return it?

04:52.791 --> 04:54.090
Why wouldn't you open it?

04:54.092 --> 04:55.191
Well, she was pretty mad.

04:55.193 --> 04:57.026
For all I know
it's a voodoo doll of me

04:57.028 --> 04:59.629
with a fork stuck in my junk.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.433
You don't think she'd actually
send you something gross

05:03.435 --> 05:04.867
or dangerous, do you?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.437
I know one way
to find out-- sniff this.

05:09.274 --> 05:12.542
She's pregnant,
she's not a bloodhound.

05:12.544 --> 05:14.344
Although I am getting
a little machine oil.

05:14.346 --> 05:16.012
I think it's metal.

05:16.014 --> 05:17.647
Come on, just open it.

05:17.649 --> 05:20.550
You know,
on <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

05:20.552 --> 05:24.387
Balon Greyjoy received
his son's genitals in a box.

05:24.389 --> 05:27.090
Well, never hurts
to have a spare.

05:30.095 --> 05:31.327
BERNADETTE:
What is that?

05:31.329 --> 05:34.130
Wow. It's an antique sextant.

05:34.132 --> 05:37.867
Sailors used these to find
their position by the stars.

05:37.869 --> 05:40.269
What a nice gift
for an astrophysicist.

05:40.271 --> 05:41.871
I know, she's so thoughtful.

05:41.873 --> 05:43.539
See, she's trying
to get you back.

05:43.541 --> 05:45.308
Now, that is exactly
what I would've gotten you

05:45.310 --> 05:49.012
if I had any idea
what it is or what you do.

05:49.014 --> 05:52.215
You know, I have too much
self-esteem to let this girl

05:52.217 --> 05:54.517
guilt me into getting back
together with her.

05:54.519 --> 05:58.788
You don't need to be pregnant
to smell that load of crap.

06:00.959 --> 06:04.027
Well, what if we go
around the university

06:04.029 --> 06:05.194
and just get
the patent ourselves?

06:05.196 --> 06:06.529
We can't.
It says on their Web site,

06:06.531 --> 06:08.097
as long as we work there,
they have

06:08.099 --> 06:11.367
a controlling ownership
of anything we come up with.

06:11.369 --> 06:13.903
Great, so they own
my idea for a T-shirt

06:13.905 --> 06:17.140
that says
“Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.”

06:20.445 --> 06:22.945
Well, our choices are we
do this with the university

06:22.947 --> 06:24.213
or we don't do it at all.

06:24.215 --> 06:27.116
Either way, I get nothing.

06:27.118 --> 06:29.452
Or, if we ended up
making money from this,

06:29.454 --> 06:32.255
Sheldon and I could split
our shares with you.

06:32.257 --> 06:34.123
To be clear,

06:34.125 --> 06:35.625
Leonard is referring
to the gyroscope,

06:35.627 --> 06:38.194
not the T-shirt and mugs.

06:38.196 --> 06:41.130
Oh! Now they own the mugs.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.667
I guess that is
a way around this.

06:44.669 --> 06:46.969
You guys would be cool
doing it like that?

06:46.971 --> 06:48.771
Of course, we can split
any profits three ways.

06:48.773 --> 06:49.739
I'm fine with that.

06:49.741 --> 06:51.507
Okay, great.

06:51.509 --> 06:55.211
It sounds like a, uh,
contract might be in order.

06:58.049 --> 07:00.149
Sure, we could write
something up.

07:00.151 --> 07:01.851
But which one of us should be
the party who...

07:01.853 --> 07:03.119
You can do it, Sheldon.

07:03.121 --> 07:04.754
So stipulated!

07:06.558 --> 07:09.492
Once I found a stash
of contracts under his bed.

07:09.494 --> 07:11.027
It was weird.

07:14.566 --> 07:17.900
I wonder how much
she spent on this.

07:17.902 --> 07:19.035
Ooh, let's find out.

07:19.037 --> 07:20.803
It doesn't matter.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.872
It's the thought
that counts.

07:22.874 --> 07:24.373
Yeah, yeah,
and beauty's on the inside,

07:24.375 --> 07:26.175
size doesn't matter--
how much she spend?

07:26.177 --> 07:29.545
Seriously, guys,
I don't want to know.

07:29.547 --> 07:31.047
Oh, my.

07:31.049 --> 07:34.317
Oh, come on, you can't say
“Oh, my,” and then not tell me!

07:34.319 --> 07:37.420
These things go for $500 and up.

07:37.422 --> 07:38.621
BERNADETTE:
Damn.

07:38.623 --> 07:40.623
All I got for Valentine's Day
was a postcard

07:40.625 --> 07:43.359
saying my Vermont Teddy Bear
was back-ordered.

07:43.361 --> 07:44.594
PENNY:
Okay, so, she drops off

07:44.596 --> 07:45.962
a $500 gift

07:45.964 --> 07:47.697
and she's not trying to
get back together with you?

07:47.699 --> 07:49.365
Maybe you're right.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.601
Or she's telling the truth
and just being nice.

07:51.603 --> 07:52.835
Maybe you're right.

07:52.837 --> 07:54.937
Wow, I am easy to manipulate.

07:54.939 --> 07:58.174
(phone chiming)

07:58.176 --> 08:00.243
Oh, guys, it's Emily.

08:00.245 --> 08:01.511
What should I do?

08:01.513 --> 08:02.879
Okay, answer it.
Just be strong.

08:02.881 --> 08:04.714
And if she starts to cry,
don't make any promises.

08:04.716 --> 08:07.950
And most importantly, put it
on speaker so we can hear.

08:10.088 --> 08:11.420
Hello?

08:11.422 --> 08:12.889
Hey, it's Emily.

08:12.891 --> 08:14.157
Is this a good time?

08:16.427 --> 08:18.194
Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?

08:18.196 --> 08:20.429
Was it okay I left that gift?

08:20.431 --> 08:23.099
I'm really hoping
we can be friends.

08:26.104 --> 08:28.571
Maybe, maybe.

08:28.573 --> 08:32.441
Um, you think you'd want
to grab a cup of coffee?

08:34.000 --> 08:40.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:42.754 --> 08:44.487
Hello?

08:44.489 --> 08:48.057
I'm sorry, I seem to be taking
an annoying amount of time

08:48.059 --> 08:50.193
deciding how I feel about this!

08:51.496 --> 08:54.530
I just...
I miss hanging out with you.

08:54.532 --> 08:58.367
It's not like I lost a friend,
it's like I lost my best friend.

08:58.369 --> 09:00.903
(choking up):
Is there any chance

09:00.905 --> 09:03.139
you'd want to come over?

09:06.144 --> 09:09.679
I'm sorry, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.747
Okay. I'm just...

09:11.749 --> 09:13.216
(crying):
I'm having a really hard time,

09:13.218 --> 09:15.985
but that's not your problem,
that's mine.

09:15.987 --> 09:17.887
I-I won't bother you again,

09:17.889 --> 09:22.024
but please know that you'll
always have a place in my heart.

09:27.065 --> 09:28.364
Bye, Raj.

09:28.366 --> 09:30.700
You're a good guy.

09:30.702 --> 09:33.002
Good-bye, Emily.

09:34.572 --> 09:36.973
(sighs):
That was rough, you guys.

09:36.975 --> 09:38.841
I know, but you did it.
I'm so proud of you.

09:38.843 --> 09:41.477
Well, anyway, I'll leave you
to your girls' night.

09:41.479 --> 09:43.379
Are you sure you don't want
to stay here with us?

09:43.381 --> 09:45.381
No, I kind of feel like
being alone right now.

09:45.383 --> 09:47.383
Well, if you change your mind,
we'll be here.

09:47.385 --> 09:49.318
Thank you.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.187
Say hi to Emily for us.

09:51.189 --> 09:53.356
Will do.

10:01.449 --> 10:03.883
This contract
looks good to me.

10:03.885 --> 10:05.484
I'll say it looks good.

10:05.486 --> 10:08.587
It's in my proprietary
font, Shelvetica.

10:10.858 --> 10:13.225
I want to say
something obnoxious,

10:13.227 --> 10:16.228
but it is easy on the eyes.

10:16.230 --> 10:19.365
I'm a little tired, Howie.
You ready to go?

10:19.367 --> 10:21.800
Yeah, one sec. I just need
to sign this contract.

10:21.802 --> 10:23.569
What is it?
Well, we ran into a problem

10:23.571 --> 10:25.271
about my share of the patent,
so we're forming

10:25.273 --> 10:28.073
a partnership to split
anything we make equally.

10:28.075 --> 10:29.708
Sheldon, did you draft
the contract?

10:29.710 --> 10:30.876
You bet I did.

10:30.878 --> 10:34.146
Ooh. You're gonna make
out so hard tonight.

10:38.119 --> 10:39.451
So, you're
just gonna sign this

10:39.453 --> 10:41.253
without having
a lawyer look at it?

10:41.255 --> 10:42.788
Excuse me.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.124
I've been drafting contracts
since kindergarten.

10:45.126 --> 10:47.126
Didn't need a lawyer to get me
out of finger painting.

10:47.128 --> 10:49.461
Don't need one now.

10:49.463 --> 10:51.063
I know, but...
Bernie,

10:51.065 --> 10:52.798
the guys were nice enough
to find a way

10:52.800 --> 10:54.533
to keep me from being cut out.

10:54.535 --> 10:56.435
Well, I should hope so.

10:56.437 --> 10:58.103
The whole thing was your idea.

10:58.105 --> 11:03.609
Well, to be fair, Howard's idea
was based on Sheldon's math.

11:03.611 --> 11:05.544
Guys, everyone is involved
in this, okay?

11:05.546 --> 11:06.946
Howard's invention,

11:06.948 --> 11:08.681
Sheldon's math,
my original theory

11:08.683 --> 11:11.016
that space-time was like
a supercooled liquid.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.918
Which I'm sure
Penny would've mentioned

11:12.920 --> 11:15.688
if she wasn't working
on that hangnail right now.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.991
What?

11:20.194 --> 11:22.161
Honey, this is fine.

11:22.163 --> 11:24.730
If you want to sign a contract
that Sheldon whipped up,

11:24.732 --> 11:25.698
go ahead.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.633
Can I talk to you in the hall?

11:27.635 --> 11:29.535
Sure.
Excuse us.

11:31.973 --> 11:33.639
Hey, Leonard.
What?

11:33.641 --> 11:36.675
If she doesn't think that
we should apply for this patent,

11:36.677 --> 11:39.545
she's being patently absurd.

11:41.349 --> 11:43.048
Good one.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.250
Okay, you got it.

11:45.252 --> 11:48.420
See, I was afraid
it was a thinker.

11:49.991 --> 11:52.091
What are you doing?
I just want to make sure

11:52.093 --> 11:53.325
you've thought this through.

11:53.327 --> 11:55.160
What's to think about?
We have an invention

11:55.162 --> 11:56.562
and want to move forward.

11:56.564 --> 11:59.732
Howie, you're about
to form a legal partnership

11:59.734 --> 12:02.735
with Sheldon Cooper.

12:03.938 --> 12:06.105
All right, if you're gonna
calmly make excellent points,

12:06.107 --> 12:08.173
then I don't know
if I want to talk to you.

12:11.612 --> 12:13.212
Okay. I get it.

12:13.214 --> 12:15.247
And it's sweet that
you're worried about me,

12:15.249 --> 12:17.583
but I can take care of myself.

12:17.585 --> 12:20.185
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about me.

12:20.187 --> 12:22.688
I don't want to go through
this pregnancy listening

12:22.690 --> 12:25.257
to you complain about Sheldon
driving you crazy

12:25.259 --> 12:26.325
more than you already do.

12:26.327 --> 12:30.896
Here we go with
the ironclad logic again.

12:30.898 --> 12:33.632
You've tried to work
with him before.

12:33.634 --> 12:34.900
It hasn't gone well.

12:34.902 --> 12:37.403
Why is this time
gonna be any different?

12:37.405 --> 12:39.505
Is the fetus helping you?

12:39.507 --> 12:41.373
'Cause that's cheating.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.378
(phone rings)

12:46.380 --> 12:48.447
Hello?
CLAIRE: Hey, Raj.

12:48.449 --> 12:49.815
It's Claire. How are you?

12:49.817 --> 12:51.884
Hi. I'm good. Really good.

12:51.886 --> 12:53.952
Well, I don't know
why I said “really good.”

12:53.954 --> 12:55.220
I'm just regular good.

12:55.222 --> 12:56.555
I really just wanted
to sound confident.

12:56.557 --> 12:58.190
And that “really”
was a real “really,”

12:58.192 --> 13:01.794
not a fake “really”
like the first “really.”

13:01.796 --> 13:03.028
Really?

13:03.030 --> 13:06.065
I don't know. I lost track
and I missed my exit.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.833
So, uh... so what's up?

13:07.835 --> 13:09.134
Well, last time we talked,

13:09.136 --> 13:12.104
I had just gotten back together
with my boyfriend,

13:12.106 --> 13:14.907
and I wanted to let you know
that things didn't work out.

13:14.909 --> 13:16.308
Really? I'm sorry.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.577
I swear I know other words.

13:18.579 --> 13:20.913
So if you were
still interested...

13:20.915 --> 13:23.382
Yes! Indeed!
Absolutely! Indubitably!

13:23.384 --> 13:25.217
I'm not even sure
what the last one means,

13:25.219 --> 13:27.319
but it's another word,
and I know it.

13:27.321 --> 13:28.821
So, uh,

13:28.823 --> 13:30.289
when do you want to meet up?

13:30.291 --> 13:31.990
Uh, I'm almost off work.

13:31.992 --> 13:33.192
What are you doing now?

13:33.194 --> 13:35.094
R-Right now, well...

13:35.096 --> 13:37.529
Well, actually,
to-to be completely honest,

13:37.531 --> 13:39.264
I'm stopping by
to see my ex-girlfriend

13:39.266 --> 13:41.033
because she's having
a tough time. But...

13:41.035 --> 13:42.968
it's not like we're getting
back together or anything.

13:42.970 --> 13:45.704
Let me guess, the worst part
about breaking up

13:45.706 --> 13:48.841
is that she doesn't have her
best friend to talk to anymore?

13:48.843 --> 13:50.342
That's exactly what she said!

13:50.344 --> 13:51.777
How do you know that?

13:51.779 --> 13:54.813
I'm a girl. It's, like,
page one out of the playbook.

13:54.815 --> 13:58.150
Any chance you could send me
a PDF of that playbook?

14:00.688 --> 14:02.054
They've been out
there a while.

14:02.056 --> 14:03.655
I hope
everything's okay.

14:03.657 --> 14:06.091
I wonder what they're talking about.
PENNY: If you guys

14:06.093 --> 14:08.560
would shut up,
I could tell you.

14:08.562 --> 14:09.595
Oh.

14:09.597 --> 14:11.430
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.732
Hey.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.501
Hello.
Hey. You guys all right?

14:15.503 --> 14:18.971
Yeah. But, um, we were talking,

14:18.973 --> 14:21.840
and... I'm a
little concerned

14:21.842 --> 14:24.409
about the three of us
forming a partnership.

14:25.513 --> 14:29.748
Are you suggesting
a limited liability corporation?

14:29.750 --> 14:33.485
'Cause I did not
L-L-see that coming.

14:35.256 --> 14:38.257
Sheldon, my concern is not
with the money or anything.

14:38.259 --> 14:41.126
It's-it's with
how you treat me.

14:41.128 --> 14:44.029
Well, I believe I'm
treating you generously.

14:44.031 --> 14:46.198
That's why I've stipulated
in the contract

14:46.200 --> 14:48.100
that your contributions
to our invention

14:48.102 --> 14:50.102
are as valuable as my own.

14:50.104 --> 14:51.770
Are you saying
that his contributions

14:51.772 --> 14:53.739
aren't as valuable
as yours?

14:53.741 --> 14:55.807
No, I am not saying that,

14:55.809 --> 14:58.010
because I kept saying
that this morning

14:58.012 --> 15:00.345
and Leonard said,
“Stop saying that”"

15:02.383 --> 15:04.683
See? This is what happens
every time we work together.

15:04.685 --> 15:05.918
PENNY:
You know what, hang on.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.586
What if Sheldon had no choice

15:07.588 --> 15:09.087
but to be respectful?

15:09.089 --> 15:13.292
Is there a switch on the back
of his neck we don't know about?

15:13.294 --> 15:15.360
PENNY:
No.

15:15.362 --> 15:17.162
What I'm saying is you could add
a clause to the contract

15:17.164 --> 15:18.797
that he can't make fun
of Howard.

15:18.799 --> 15:20.532
How would you enforce it?

15:20.534 --> 15:22.367
Oh, please.
Any contract I sign

15:22.369 --> 15:25.070
is enforced by my own
personal code of ethics.

15:25.072 --> 15:26.905
And his obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

15:26.907 --> 15:28.273
Yeah, that, too.

15:29.143 --> 15:30.242
And scoot over.

15:30.244 --> 15:32.778
Part of your shadow's
on my spot.

15:35.983 --> 15:37.583
Howard, what do you think?

15:37.585 --> 15:39.751
I'm on board.

15:39.753 --> 15:41.286
I'll add it right now.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.789
Oh, baby, it's addendum time!

15:47.494 --> 15:49.428
(line ringing)

15:49.430 --> 15:50.929
EMILY:
Hello?

15:50.931 --> 15:52.397
Hey, Emily, listen,

15:52.399 --> 15:54.566
I've been thinking,
and I'm not sure

15:54.568 --> 15:56.468
it's a good idea
that I come over.

15:56.470 --> 15:57.869
Oh.

15:57.871 --> 16:00.672
(crying):
Okay. I understand.

16:00.674 --> 16:02.774
No, no. Please don't cry.

16:02.776 --> 16:05.344
Okay, I'll stop!

16:05.346 --> 16:06.912
Hello?

16:06.914 --> 16:11.383
Hey, so, listen, Claire,
change of plans...

16:11.385 --> 16:14.353
Fine. Do what you want,
but she's playing you.

16:14.355 --> 16:17.055
I don't think so.
She sounded pretty upset.

16:17.057 --> 16:18.290
You mean like...

16:18.292 --> 16:20.425
“I was just really
looking forward to seeing you.

16:20.427 --> 16:22.894
I'm having such a rough day.”

16:22.896 --> 16:26.798
Emily, listen...

16:26.800 --> 16:29.368
I'm sorry,

16:29.370 --> 16:31.236
but I can't come by.

16:31.238 --> 16:32.437
Why not?

16:32.439 --> 16:34.673
I think we both know
if I come over,

16:34.675 --> 16:37.109
we're gonna get back together and...
I told you

16:37.111 --> 16:38.243
I needed a friend.

16:38.245 --> 16:41.013
What do you think
is happening here?

16:41.815 --> 16:45.017
Call you right back.

16:47.688 --> 16:51.857
The-the revisions I made
start on page four.

16:51.859 --> 16:55.227
Wow. That is a lot
of “whereupons”.

16:55.229 --> 16:58.630
You should see the
Valentine's Day card he gave me.

16:58.632 --> 17:01.633
“Article three:
As it pertains to this project,

17:01.635 --> 17:04.869
“Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises
to abstain from all insulting or

17:04.872 --> 17:07.839
“disrespectful language
directed toward Howard Wolowitz,

17:07.840 --> 17:10.842
“including but not limited to:
mockery of engineering,

17:10.844 --> 17:12.444
“his height, his hair,
his wardrobe,

17:12.445 --> 17:15.981
“and his insane belief
that the <i>Ghost Rider</i> movie

17:15.983 --> 17:19.017
was, quote, 'not that bad.'”

17:20.721 --> 17:23.121
Hang on. Maybe there should be
a “no insult” clause

17:23.123 --> 17:24.455
about me, too.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.590
Do you still like cilantro?
Yeah.

17:26.593 --> 17:28.393
You're tying my hands here.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.197
All right, let's sign this.
PENNY: Wait, wait, wait.

17:32.199 --> 17:34.232
What are these changes
on page six?

17:34.234 --> 17:35.534
Sheldon, what did you do?

17:35.536 --> 17:36.368
WOLOWITZ:
I should've known.

17:36.370 --> 17:38.036
“25% of profits

17:38.038 --> 17:41.139
“due to Sheldon Cooper will be
allocated to a scholarship fund

17:41.141 --> 17:44.876
for the firstborn child of
Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz”"

17:45.713 --> 17:48.380
Sheldon, that's so nice.

17:48.382 --> 17:49.448
LEONARD: That beats

17:49.450 --> 17:51.049
the onesie I was gonna get them

17:51.051 --> 17:53.352
from babyGap.

17:54.188 --> 17:56.888
That's very generous,
Sheldon.

17:56.890 --> 17:59.558
Oh, I've always valued
education over money.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.394
And the very fact that you
needed a written guarantee

18:02.396 --> 18:03.829
of respect made me realize

18:03.831 --> 18:06.431
how dismissive I've been
of your contributions.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.134
I appreciate that.
And I just hope

18:09.136 --> 18:12.671
that this scholarship
can rescue your child

18:12.673 --> 18:14.272
from the subpar education

18:14.274 --> 18:18.310
and menial life
of an engineer.

18:19.713 --> 18:21.646
Sheldon.
What?

18:21.648 --> 18:23.849
I didn't sign it yet.

18:32.348 --> 18:33.881
I hear what you're saying,

18:33.883 --> 18:35.482
but I've known Emily
a long time,

18:35.484 --> 18:37.918
and I think she deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.653
All right, it's your life.

18:39.655 --> 18:41.889
But you know
how this is gonna end.

18:41.891 --> 18:43.357
As a matter of fact, I do.

18:43.359 --> 18:45.526
I'm gonna comfort her,
because I'm a caring

18:45.528 --> 18:47.494
and decent friend
who's happy to be there

18:47.496 --> 18:50.497
when she needs someone
to talk to.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.399
Good talk.
