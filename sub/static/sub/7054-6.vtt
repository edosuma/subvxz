00:00.247 --> 00:01.712
Previously on Fringe...

00:01.784 --> 00:04.928
Walternate said that there's a very
powerful piece of ancient tech.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.424
Has he finished assembling it?

00:06.526 --> 00:07.616
He was missing several pieces.

00:07.727 --> 00:09.135
This machine is dangerous.

00:09.224 --> 00:10.920
Which is why we need
to understand it.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.423
Our Agent Dunham,
has she made contact?

00:13.568 --> 00:16.436
She's on the other
side, focused on the task at hand.

00:16.504 --> 00:18.071
I had a really
nice time tonight.

00:18.139 --> 00:19.906
Me too.

00:19.974 --> 00:21.508
I don't know
what your mission is.

00:21.576 --> 00:23.910
I imagine it requires you
to gain Peter bishop's trust.

00:23.978 --> 00:26.246
You're in over your head.

00:26.314 --> 00:27.914
Your emotions betray you,

00:27.982 --> 00:29.950
And you question your ability
to pull this off.

00:30.017 --> 00:32.786
And that will lead
to your undoing.

00:32.853 --> 00:34.254
<i>I would like to talk to you.</i>

00:37.425 --> 00:39.159
I lied to you.
About what?

00:39.227 --> 00:42.128
I don't want to talk.

00:50.838 --> 00:54.941
<i>Stockton harbor,
Stockton harbor, come in.</i>

00:55.009 --> 00:56.843
<i>Requesting clearance.</i>

00:56.911 --> 00:58.511
<i>Tide is coming in strong.</i>

00:58.579 --> 01:00.347
<i>Pulling a fog bank in
from the East.</i>

01:00.414 --> 01:02.716
It's close to shore,
so watch yourself

01:02.783 --> 01:04.884
And take it slow.

01:04.952 --> 01:07.287
<i>Copy that. We see it up ahead.</i>

01:07.355 --> 01:08.555
<i>Looks like pea soup.</i>

01:08.623 --> 01:09.923
Maintain a bearing
at three-five-eight.

01:09.991 --> 01:13.159
I've hung a lantern out
for you.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:41.389 --> 01:44.658
<i>Shen, are you
seriously not coming?</i>

01:44.725 --> 01:46.860
Dude, when I crack this thing,

01:46.927 --> 01:51.598
They are gonna write books
about me.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.183
Hey, Beck.
You want a tea?

02:10.251 --> 02:12.218
Love one.

02:12.286 --> 02:14.354
Hey, Aaron.
You gonna make mommy a tea?

02:18.492 --> 02:19.526
It's starting.

02:19.593 --> 02:21.494
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

03:17.218 --> 03:19.285
<i>Captain Barrett
to fort point light station.</i>

03:19.353 --> 03:20.286
<i>Come in.
Over.</i>

03:29.964 --> 03:31.731
<i>Fort point,
we're lost in the fog bank.</i>

03:31.799 --> 03:35.435
<i>We can't see the light.
Over.</i>

03:35.503 --> 03:37.170
<i>Fort point, are you there?</i>

03:37.238 --> 03:39.172
<i>This is Swedish fish.
Come in.</i>

03:39.240 --> 03:42.075
<i>Murray, it's Dave.
I've got no eyes out here.</i>

03:42.143 --> 03:44.944
Hey, I forgot my I.D.

03:47.615 --> 03:52.452
Dude.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.756
Shen?

04:01.495 --> 04:04.798
Becky.

04:04.865 --> 04:06.733
<i>Stay away from me.
Whoa.</i>

04:06.801 --> 04:08.401
I said stay back!

04:08.469 --> 04:09.769
Who are you?

04:09.837 --> 04:12.305
It's me, laird.

04:18.512 --> 04:20.947
Who am I?

04:22.077 --> 04:28.348
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

04:52.261 --> 04:54.162
This is better
than room service.

04:55.398 --> 04:57.032
What did I do to get so lucky?

04:57.100 --> 04:58.200
Nothing.

04:58.267 --> 05:00.869
It's just for being you.

05:00.937 --> 05:02.471
Thank you.

05:02.538 --> 05:04.406
<i>You're welcome.</i>

05:04.474 --> 05:06.508
So what's the latest catastrophe
I want to know nothing about?

05:06.576 --> 05:08.910
Well, uh, earthquakes,
oil spills,

05:08.978 --> 05:10.112
Financial disaster.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.780
It's not really the best way
to start the day.

05:11.848 --> 05:13.315
Here I thought
there was nothing good

05:13.382 --> 05:15.217
Until the entertainment section.

05:15.284 --> 05:17.219
What's in
the entertainment section?

05:17.286 --> 05:20.255
I don't know,
but you should find out.

05:30.032 --> 05:31.433
I love u2.

05:31.501 --> 05:34.136
I figured we were way overdue
for a normal date.

05:34.203 --> 05:37.772
That is just so sweet
and so kind of romantic.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.741
Try not to sound so shocked.

05:39.809 --> 05:43.011
Thank you.

05:50.987 --> 05:52.954
Walter?

05:53.022 --> 05:56.057
Walter, is that you?

05:56.125 --> 05:57.559
Of course it's me.

05:57.627 --> 06:00.162
I came in this morning
and found your little project.

06:00.229 --> 06:03.298
And what project would that be?

06:03.366 --> 06:05.000
You know very well
what project.

06:05.067 --> 06:07.636
You are continuing to work
on this infernal device...

06:07.703 --> 06:08.970
The one depicted
in the blueprints.

06:09.038 --> 06:11.139
That's correct.
I'm running diagnostics.

06:11.207 --> 06:12.274
<i>I thought I made my...</i>

06:16.212 --> 06:18.013
<i>You have no idea
what it does.</i>

06:18.080 --> 06:21.149
You might as well be building
a nuclear bomb in my lab.

06:22.552 --> 06:24.252
I don't think
that's entirely fair.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.687
<i>Do you?
Well, fine.</i>

06:25.755 --> 06:27.689
If you end up breaking
the universe,

06:27.757 --> 06:29.624
This time, it's on your head.

06:34.197 --> 06:35.363
<i>What was that about?</i>

06:35.431 --> 06:36.698
It's nothing.

06:36.766 --> 06:38.166
<i>Apparently,
Walter doesn't want me</i>

06:38.234 --> 06:39.267
Playing with his toys.

06:43.072 --> 06:44.539
Dunham.

06:46.576 --> 06:49.110
Yes, sir.

06:49.178 --> 06:52.147
We'll meet you there.

06:52.215 --> 06:54.616
Broyles.

06:54.684 --> 06:56.618
Guess that means we're doing
the crossword in the car.

06:58.888 --> 07:00.922
So 15 people all up and down
the eastern seaboard

07:00.990 --> 07:03.892
All suffered from retrograde
amnesia at the same time?

07:03.960 --> 07:06.795
Around 10:45 P.M.
Collective memory loss.

07:06.862 --> 07:09.231
<i>That's a new one
for the medical books.</i>

07:09.298 --> 07:10.966
According to the Pentagon,
the victims were all using

07:11.033 --> 07:12.067
Shortwave radios.

07:12.134 --> 07:13.635
Ham-radio enthusiasts...

07:13.703 --> 07:16.671
Maybe their brains were erased
by the magnetic winds

07:16.739 --> 07:18.006
<i>From the solar storm?</i>

07:18.074 --> 07:20.175
If it hadn't happened
four hours after sundown,

07:20.243 --> 07:21.509
<i>You might be on
to something.</i>

07:21.577 --> 07:22.844
<i>Becky Woomer.</i>

07:22.912 --> 07:24.179
Her husband said
he left her alone

07:24.247 --> 07:25.347
For roughly three minutes.

07:25.414 --> 07:27.115
In that time,
she forgot all details

07:27.183 --> 07:28.483
About her life,
including her name.

07:28.551 --> 07:29.918
<i>The d.O.D. Is concerned</i>

07:29.986 --> 07:32.254
<i>This could be a test run
for a potential terror attack.</i>

07:32.321 --> 07:34.289
The doctors at the hospital
don't understand it.

07:34.357 --> 07:37.659
They can't even tell me if she's
gonna get her memory back.

07:37.727 --> 07:41.730
Did your wife ever tell you what
it was she was listening to?

07:41.797 --> 07:43.565
<i>Becky was a moderator
in a chat room.</i>

07:43.633 --> 07:45.533
They listen to number stations.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.839
Number stations?

07:50.906 --> 07:53.575
I don't know much about them.

07:53.643 --> 07:57.045
They're kind of a mystery.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.683
A reel-to-reel.

08:01.751 --> 08:04.586
I used to have one
exactly like this.

08:04.654 --> 08:07.756
I remember hours spent
ripped out of my gourd

08:07.823 --> 08:11.259
<i>Listening to Beatles albums
backwards for secret messages.</i>

08:11.327 --> 08:14.429
They weren't there.

08:15.931 --> 08:18.433
So apparently Becky recorded
last night's broadcast.

08:18.501 --> 08:21.469
Whatever she heard
should be on that tape.

08:21.537 --> 08:25.940
Listening to what they recorded
last night could cause us

08:26.008 --> 08:27.776
<i>To forget
why we wanted to listen</i>

08:27.843 --> 08:30.312
In the first place, Einstein.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.982
Did he say what he thinks
is on it?

08:34.049 --> 08:35.417
<i>He said that she spends
her nights listening</i>

08:35.484 --> 08:38.820
To numbers on random
ham-radio stations.

08:38.888 --> 08:40.388
She's trying
to crack some code.

08:40.456 --> 08:41.756
Number stations?

08:41.823 --> 08:42.924
You heard of them?

08:42.991 --> 08:44.826
Number stations...

08:44.894 --> 08:47.829
Nobody knows what they are
or even where they come from.

08:47.897 --> 08:50.432
As far as anyone knows,

08:50.499 --> 08:52.033
<i>They're artificially
generated voices</i>

08:52.101 --> 08:53.735
<i>Reading streams
of random numbers</i>

08:53.803 --> 08:55.170
<i>In a wide variety
of languages.</i>

08:55.237 --> 08:57.105
The department of defense hired
us to investigate them.

08:57.173 --> 08:59.240
Other than the fact that they
were first discovered

08:59.308 --> 09:02.777
More than 70 years ago,
we came up with nothing.

09:02.845 --> 09:05.580
We could never triangulate
their point of origin.

09:05.648 --> 09:08.717
This one we picked up
four years ago.

09:18.127 --> 09:19.894
<i>Some people think they may
be covert communications</i>

09:19.962 --> 09:22.931
Between spies
or drug traffickers.

09:22.998 --> 09:24.899
Problem is no one has been able
to find proof

09:24.967 --> 09:27.135
To support any theory at all,
so at the moment,

09:27.203 --> 09:28.136
They remain unexplained.

09:28.204 --> 09:29.337
But the number broadcasts

09:29.405 --> 09:30.939
Have never caused
amnesia before.

09:31.006 --> 09:32.974
Not to the best
of our knowledge.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.176
Perhaps Peter would like
to play last night's tape

09:35.244 --> 09:36.778
Aloud to everyone,

09:36.846 --> 09:39.080
Given his recent fondness

09:39.148 --> 09:42.217
For dangerous activity.

09:43.519 --> 09:44.753
As soon as she's up to it,

09:44.820 --> 09:47.322
I would like to examine
the woman who lost her mind.

09:47.390 --> 09:48.923
And I think I know a way

09:48.991 --> 09:52.193
To analyze the tape
without losing our memories.

09:56.298 --> 09:59.868
Oh, I need something from
the child development center.

09:59.935 --> 10:01.770
Sixth floor?

10:01.837 --> 10:03.638
Actually, the seventh.

10:08.611 --> 10:10.879
You might want
to escort him, Peter.

10:10.946 --> 10:12.447
Yesterday, he spent
15 minutes in front

10:12.515 --> 10:15.550
Of a utility closet thinking
it was the elevator.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.652
Right.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.121
Be right back.

10:20.189 --> 10:22.257
Would you mind if Astrid took
a look at your research?

10:22.324 --> 10:24.225
She might pick up something
that your code bre

10:24.293 --> 10:25.627
Of course.

10:25.694 --> 10:27.829
Olivia, are Peter
and Walter okay?

10:27.897 --> 10:30.131
Yeah.

10:30.199 --> 10:31.666
You know we found a piece
of the machine

10:31.734 --> 10:33.268
That walternate is building,

10:33.335 --> 10:34.836
And Peter's trying
to figure it out.

10:34.904 --> 10:35.970
He should.

10:36.038 --> 10:37.472
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

10:37.540 --> 10:40.909
Except Walter doesn't agree.
He won't help.

10:40.976 --> 10:43.111
He's setting up roadblocks
for Peter.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.580
You know, you two go back
a long way.

10:45.648 --> 10:47.582
Maybe you could talk to him.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.751
What, you're not
having any luck?

10:49.819 --> 10:51.586
Oh, I haven't tried.

10:51.654 --> 10:54.722
But that's not like you.

10:54.790 --> 10:56.724
You're usually more direct
with Walter.

10:56.792 --> 11:00.495
Well, it's complicated
between them.

11:00.563 --> 11:02.263
I don't want to make it worse.

11:06.969 --> 11:09.504
I'll speak with Walter.

11:09.572 --> 11:11.072
Dunham.

11:11.140 --> 11:13.875
Yes?

11:13.943 --> 11:16.578
Where?

11:16.645 --> 11:18.446
Homeland security
traced the broadcast.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.482
When they tried to contact
the tower employees,

11:20.549 --> 11:24.419
They didn't get a response.

11:24.487 --> 11:25.887
As far as we can tell,

11:25.955 --> 11:27.856
The break-in happened
around 10:30.

11:27.923 --> 11:29.557
Security system was
state-of-the-art.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.965
Whoever did this was a pro,
but there's something else.

12:27.393 --> 12:29.093
How the hell is it doing that?

12:29.161 --> 12:30.862
It's not floating exactly.

12:30.930 --> 12:35.366
Apparently it's got some
sort of magnetics inside.

12:35.434 --> 12:36.968
So do you think
that this was the source

12:37.036 --> 12:38.436
Of last night's
number broadcast?

12:38.504 --> 12:40.238
<i>It's definitely wired
to output a transmission.</i>

12:40.306 --> 12:41.406
Hold on.

12:41.473 --> 12:45.410
I want to see that panel.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.512
I need the print powder.

12:54.186 --> 12:55.753
<i>It's impossible
to do microelectronics</i>

12:55.821 --> 12:56.754
<i>With gloves on.</i>

12:56.822 --> 12:58.990
Let's get this to Dr. Bishop.

13:02.394 --> 13:05.430
This should keep me busy for...

13:05.497 --> 13:07.265
Eternity.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.300
Thank you.

13:09.368 --> 13:11.002
<i>Okay, that was Olivia.</i>

13:11.070 --> 13:12.704
They're analyzing
the fingerprints they found

13:12.771 --> 13:14.238
Up at the radio tower,
and they think they found

13:14.306 --> 13:16.274
The device used to upload
last night's broadcast.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.610
What?

13:20.679 --> 13:21.813
What's that?

13:25.985 --> 13:28.987
"property of massive dynamic"?

13:29.054 --> 13:31.522
It's not theft
if you own the company.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.591
I've found a way to listen

13:33.659 --> 13:35.393
To the tape
of the numbers broadcast

13:35.461 --> 13:37.095
Without losing
what faculties I have left.

13:37.162 --> 13:39.263
Well, how'd you manage that?

13:39.331 --> 13:44.502
The key is analog demodulation.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.004
I knew my Jimi Hendrix

13:46.071 --> 13:48.539
Wah-wah pedal
would come in handy.

13:48.607 --> 13:49.941
Take a look.

13:50.009 --> 13:51.609
This is the sound
of the transmission,

13:51.677 --> 13:55.980
<i>Modified so it's safe,
of course.</i>

13:56.048 --> 13:57.649
But if we demodulate...

14:00.753 --> 14:02.687
<i>so there are two signals?</i>

14:02.755 --> 14:03.855
<i>Precisely.</i>

14:03.922 --> 14:05.790
<i>The top wave is the numbers.</i>

14:05.858 --> 14:07.592
The bottom wave,
which I have suppressed,

14:07.660 --> 14:08.993
Is a pulse.

14:09.061 --> 14:12.030
<i>And I believe that this
is responsible for the amnesia.</i>

14:12.097 --> 14:13.431
Someone found a way to attach

14:13.499 --> 14:15.767
<i>This pulse
to the numbers broadcast.</i>

14:15.834 --> 14:18.036
Well, that explains
why nobody's

14:18.103 --> 14:20.304
<i>Been affected by listening
to the number stations before,</i>

14:20.372 --> 14:21.939
Because they're not causing
the problem.

14:22.007 --> 14:24.676
So we still don't know where
the numbers are coming from,

14:24.743 --> 14:27.412
But I suspect that the device
that Agent Dunham found

14:27.479 --> 14:28.913
Is the source of the pulse.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.482
Okay, but who would do this,

14:31.550 --> 14:34.318
<i>And why give
these people amnesia?</i>

14:34.386 --> 14:35.586
Because they cracked the code,

14:35.654 --> 14:38.623
<i>Or they came damn close
to figuring out</i>

14:38.691 --> 14:40.058
<i>What number stations are.</i>

14:40.125 --> 14:42.360
And somebody wants to keep
that a secret.

14:42.428 --> 14:43.728
<i>Well done.</i>

14:43.796 --> 14:48.399
You sounded very Sherlock Holmes
just then.

14:48.467 --> 14:50.401
That would make you
Watson, dear.

14:50.469 --> 14:53.271
Walter...

14:53.338 --> 14:54.972
Is this the soundboard
I was using

14:55.040 --> 14:56.741
To run diagnostics
on the weapon?

14:56.809 --> 14:59.177
I was using it
to down-convert the signal.

14:59.244 --> 15:02.513
Really?

15:04.950 --> 15:07.985
I was focused on solving
the case at hand.

15:08.053 --> 15:10.421
I'm not concerned
with preserving

15:10.489 --> 15:12.323
Your wretched experiment.

15:12.391 --> 15:15.426
Now, if you don't mind,
I have some thinking to do.

15:20.532 --> 15:22.800
This has got to stop.

15:28.407 --> 15:29.907
Walter...

15:29.975 --> 15:34.378
I asked you not to work
on that device in my lab.

15:34.446 --> 15:35.913
They're working on it
on the other side.

15:35.981 --> 15:38.449
<i>We need to understand
exactly what it does.</i>

15:38.517 --> 15:40.718
What's to understand?

15:40.786 --> 15:42.687
You're playing with fire.

15:42.755 --> 15:45.957
Stop being so bullheaded
and put a stop to this.

15:49.762 --> 15:52.196
Walter...

15:55.033 --> 15:58.703
When I touched that device
on the other side...

15:58.771 --> 16:02.707
It came alive in my hands...

16:02.775 --> 16:06.611
<i>Like it was bonded
directly to me.</i>

16:06.678 --> 16:10.281
How can you expect me
to ignore that?

16:14.219 --> 16:16.921
<i>I just talked to Olivia.</i>

16:16.989 --> 16:19.357
They pulled a picture
of our suspect from his prints.

16:19.424 --> 16:20.892
She's taking it
to the Woomer house now

16:20.959 --> 16:22.160
To show it to the husband.

16:22.227 --> 16:23.961
Becky was released
from the hospital.

16:24.029 --> 16:25.830
She's back home now.
Oh.

16:50.155 --> 16:52.456
His name is Joseph feller.

16:52.524 --> 16:54.826
<i>Earlier today,
we picked up his prints</i>

16:54.893 --> 16:56.227
<i>From a radio tower</i>

16:56.295 --> 16:57.728
Just outside Boston.

16:57.796 --> 16:59.130
His last known address

16:59.198 --> 17:00.832
<i>Was, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</i>

17:00.899 --> 17:02.433
<i>That was 1997.</i>

17:02.501 --> 17:04.435
But since then,
he's been off the map.

17:04.502 --> 17:06.938
I've never seen him before
in my life.

17:07.005 --> 17:09.440
Do you mind if we poke around
a little bit?

17:09.508 --> 17:11.608
<i>There's some things here
that could be useful to us.</i>

17:11.676 --> 17:13.944
Maybe check out her computer,
her address book?

17:14.012 --> 17:16.547
Of course.

17:28.292 --> 17:32.330
Read this and then do
what it says.

17:32.397 --> 17:35.399
"stand up, then sit down."

17:40.439 --> 17:42.306
Wonderful.
Thank you.

17:42.374 --> 17:45.142
Earlier, I told you the names
of three things.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.144
Cat, horse, cotton candy.

17:47.212 --> 17:49.180
Very good.

17:56.889 --> 18:00.157
It's beautiful.

18:00.225 --> 18:01.525
I don't remember doing this.

18:01.593 --> 18:05.897
I suppose I was knitting it
for the baby.

18:07.566 --> 18:10.067
I don't recognize him.

18:11.737 --> 18:15.239
I don't recognize that man
who is out there.

18:17.342 --> 18:19.210
I look at the pictures
everywhere,

18:19.278 --> 18:21.078
And I see myself in them,

18:21.146 --> 18:25.650
<i>But I-I don't know them.</i>

18:25.717 --> 18:30.521
The human brain is a miracle...

18:30.589 --> 18:33.090
A most resilient organ...

18:35.160 --> 18:39.530
A storage unit for everything
you have ever known...

18:39.598 --> 18:42.967
Seen, or felt.

18:43.035 --> 18:44.402
It's all still in there,

18:44.469 --> 18:47.905
<i>Whether or not
you're conscious of that.</i>

18:52.110 --> 18:53.945
This is a list of everybody
that Becky talked to

18:54.012 --> 18:55.813
About the number stations.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.281
You recognize anyone?

18:57.349 --> 19:00.117
Ed Markam?

19:00.185 --> 19:04.322
Bookstore owner,
purveyor of rare manuscripts,

19:04.389 --> 19:06.557
<i>Your favorite ladies' man?</i>

19:06.625 --> 19:09.060
Oh, right. How could I forget?

19:09.127 --> 19:10.261
I'm gonna give him a call,

19:10.329 --> 19:13.030
See if maybe he has
some idea about this.

19:24.843 --> 19:26.711
Walter, are you all right?

19:26.778 --> 19:30.147
I know what it's like,

19:30.215 --> 19:31.949
What this woman's
going through.

19:32.017 --> 19:33.718
I lived it.

19:33.785 --> 19:36.620
To not recognize your life...

19:36.688 --> 19:39.490
It's awful.

19:42.961 --> 19:46.764
I'm sorry, Walter.

19:46.832 --> 19:48.799
Don't be.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.968
Let's just focus
on putting a stop to this

19:51.036 --> 19:53.871
Before more people get hurt.

20:45.524 --> 20:48.492
Baltimore center,
this is landau 287.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.094
Request to divert
to Richmond. Over.

20:50.162 --> 20:51.862
<i>Roger, landau 287.</i>

20:51.930 --> 20:54.498
<i>Weather is...</i>

20:54.566 --> 20:56.500
<i>Level five thunderstorm...</i>

20:56.568 --> 20:58.536
<i>You'll have...</i>

20:58.603 --> 21:00.638
Baltimore center, say again.
You're breaking up.

21:34.549 --> 21:36.384
A small plane

21:36.451 --> 21:38.085
<i>Went down just outside
of Owings mills, Maryland.</i>

21:38.153 --> 21:39.320
NTSB just released a statement.

21:39.388 --> 21:41.555
<i>It looks like
the plane's radio</i>

21:41.623 --> 21:42.957
Was tuned
into the same frequency

21:43.025 --> 21:44.392
As the second numbers
broadcast.

21:44.459 --> 21:46.227
Precisely what
I was worried about.

21:46.295 --> 21:48.329
A second attack,
and now not only do we have

21:48.397 --> 21:51.232
20 new amnesiacs,
but 6 people died.

21:52.734 --> 21:54.769
Damn it!

21:54.836 --> 21:56.570
Why can't I get a current?

21:56.638 --> 21:58.406
Maybe you reversed the poles?

21:58.473 --> 21:59.941
No.

22:00.008 --> 22:01.876
It just doesn't make sense.

22:01.944 --> 22:05.079
Everything that I know
about the physics of electricity

22:05.147 --> 22:07.581
Says that this device
shouldn't work at all.

22:07.649 --> 22:11.252
Walter, I know that you're angry
right now, and I get it.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.554
I cannot make heads or tails
of this code.

22:13.622 --> 22:14.922
It's immense.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.491
It's not even just one code.
The... the numbers are a code.

22:17.559 --> 22:19.026
The time between the numbers
is a code.

22:21.797 --> 22:26.434
Yes, sir?

22:26.501 --> 22:28.502
<i>Okay, I will make sure
that he gets it.</i>

22:30.739 --> 22:31.872
That was Agent broyles.

22:31.940 --> 22:34.875
<i>There was another
radio tower break-in.</i>

22:34.943 --> 22:37.445
It was unmanned,
so nobody was hurt,

22:37.512 --> 22:39.246
But they found another cube...

22:39.314 --> 22:41.315
<i>The one that must have downed
the aircraft.</i>

22:41.383 --> 22:42.950
<i>They're sending it over
right now.</i>

22:43.018 --> 22:44.819
Wonderful.

22:44.886 --> 22:48.022
Another cube
I can't make any sense of.

22:49.691 --> 22:52.593
Well...

22:52.661 --> 22:54.528
Maybe this will do us
some good?

23:06.008 --> 23:09.176
All right,
let's get back to work.

23:11.580 --> 23:14.315
Number stations?

23:14.383 --> 23:16.117
It was a hobby.

23:16.184 --> 23:18.786
I banged my head on that wall
for five years and gave up.

23:18.854 --> 23:20.554
Stamp collecting...

23:20.622 --> 23:22.523
Now there's a hobby
with dividends.

23:22.591 --> 23:24.225
Well, all the people
who listened

23:24.292 --> 23:25.593
To the last two
number broadcasts

23:25.660 --> 23:27.261
Have had their memories wiped.

23:27.329 --> 23:30.698
<i>We're trying to identify
who's behind it.</i>

23:30.766 --> 23:32.299
Are you serious?

23:32.367 --> 23:34.068
Whatever they knew
and whatever they figured out

23:34.136 --> 23:35.102
About the numbers,

23:35.170 --> 23:37.038
Somebody made sure
that they forgot it.

23:37.105 --> 23:39.106
So whatever you know about what
they mean would really help us.

23:41.777 --> 23:44.078
Okay...
I'll help you,

23:44.146 --> 23:45.980
But you have to promise me
I'll be safe.

23:46.048 --> 23:47.515
Sure.
Done.

23:47.582 --> 23:50.518
Just tell us what you know
about the stations.

23:50.585 --> 23:54.922
First of all,
they're as old as Di.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.390
They say when Marconi
invented the radio,

23:56.458 --> 23:57.925
The first thing he heard
was the numbers,

23:57.993 --> 23:59.660
<i>Like they were floating
around in space</i>

23:59.728 --> 24:01.529
<i>Just waiting
for someone to listen.</i>

24:01.596 --> 24:02.997
So you're trying to tell me
that Marconi

24:03.065 --> 24:04.765
Picked up a transmission
before humans invented

24:04.833 --> 24:05.800
The technology to send one?

24:05.867 --> 24:07.868
Creepy, right?

24:17.546 --> 24:19.447
<i>Wow, the first people.</i>

24:19.514 --> 24:21.348
<i>By Seamus wiles, 1897.</i>

24:21.416 --> 24:22.583
<i>There was only one edition.</i>

24:22.651 --> 24:24.919
<i>You're holding one
of the last copies.</i>

24:24.986 --> 24:26.654
And this will tell us
what the numbers mean?

24:26.721 --> 24:28.456
No, but it'll tell you
where they came from,

24:28.523 --> 24:30.424
<i>Or one theory at least.</i>

24:30.492 --> 24:32.126
By "first people,"
what are we talking about...

24:32.194 --> 24:33.294
Adam and eve?

24:33.361 --> 24:34.662
No, before dinosaurs,

24:34.729 --> 24:36.697
<i>Before all of it,
there were the first people...</i>

24:36.765 --> 24:38.999
The first humans to evolve
on this planet.

24:39.067 --> 24:41.669
<i>If you don't know anything, you
can just say that. I'm serious.</i>

24:41.736 --> 24:43.704
Look, just read the book.
It's all in there.

24:43.772 --> 24:45.940
How much do you want for it?

24:46.007 --> 24:48.676
I don't want your money.
I want protection.

24:48.743 --> 24:50.111
What if someone comes
to erase my memories?

24:50.178 --> 24:53.347
I should be so lucky.

24:53.415 --> 24:55.116
Thanks, Markam.

25:01.389 --> 25:04.325
Fantastic.

25:04.392 --> 25:06.060
Now I have bookends.

25:06.128 --> 25:07.995
<i>Definitely a
conversation piece.</i>

25:08.063 --> 25:10.331
Nina...
If I had known you were coming,

25:10.398 --> 25:11.732
I'd have baked a cake.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.567
He means that...

25:13.635 --> 25:15.769
Literally.
Next time I'll call.

25:15.837 --> 25:18.939
Hello, Astrid.

25:19.007 --> 25:20.941
Walter, I need to speak
with you.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.983
I forgot how serious
this campus has become.

25:29.050 --> 25:31.585
I remember my time here
quite differently.

25:33.655 --> 25:35.256
We did have fun, didn't we?

25:36.791 --> 25:40.327
Don't know what happened
to this generation.

25:40.395 --> 25:41.795
I have a prescription.

25:41.863 --> 25:45.266
So do I.

25:47.602 --> 25:49.436
Look at all these students.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.906
When did they become so afraid?

25:51.973 --> 25:55.276
We had the courage
to think against the grain

25:55.343 --> 25:56.777
Of what we were told.

25:56.845 --> 25:59.313
We let our curiosity
be our guide.

25:59.381 --> 26:02.516
So why stop Peter
from following his?

26:07.022 --> 26:09.590
What Peter's doing
is different.

26:09.658 --> 26:13.994
He's bent on pursuing something
despite the grave risks

26:14.062 --> 26:15.963
It poses
to his well-being.

26:16.031 --> 26:18.332
You can't create a vaccine
without working with the virus.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.770
No, but I have experienced
what this kind of hubris can do.

26:22.837 --> 26:24.572
<i>Well, and yet you didn't heed
anyone's warnings.</i>

26:24.639 --> 26:26.707
I begged you to stop,
but you insisted

26:26.775 --> 26:28.842
On finding a way to cross over.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.945
Peter wouldn't be here now
if you hadn't.

26:31.012 --> 26:32.580
If he continues
to investigate...

26:32.647 --> 26:34.381
Yes, well, he will continue
to investigate

26:34.449 --> 26:36.317
Whether you like it or not.

26:36.384 --> 26:39.320
Then he will play right
into Walternate's hands.

26:39.387 --> 26:40.588
I... what do you mean?

26:40.655 --> 26:43.757
If only one world can survive,

26:43.825 --> 26:47.595
Then it stands to reason
that walternate will use Peter

26:47.662 --> 26:51.432
To ensure that it's
his world that does.

26:53.101 --> 26:55.803
He's already built as much
of the machine as he can.

26:55.870 --> 26:57.571
He gave the blueprints to Peter

26:57.639 --> 27:01.242
And asked him to complete it...

27:01.309 --> 27:05.346
Even though...
This...

27:05.413 --> 27:07.147
It could kill him.

27:07.215 --> 27:09.550
I remember, Walter,

27:09.618 --> 27:11.685
But who says this
is the only outcome?

27:11.753 --> 27:14.188
It's a drawing, not destiny.

27:14.256 --> 27:17.024
Even if you're right
about Walternate's plan,

27:17.092 --> 27:18.492
I mean, you don't know
if he'll succeed.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.227
And given the stakes,

27:20.295 --> 27:23.964
Won't Peter need your guidance
more than ever?

27:24.032 --> 27:26.967
Walter...

27:27.035 --> 27:29.737
One of the things I have
most admired about you

27:29.804 --> 27:33.374
Is your optimism.

27:33.441 --> 27:37.011
Don't become a fatalist now.

27:40.382 --> 27:41.715
<i>So according to this...</i>

27:41.783 --> 27:42.950
Something happened,

27:43.018 --> 27:46.153
Some sort of cataclysm
that so completely decimated

27:46.221 --> 27:47.688
The first people,
they were just wiped out

27:47.756 --> 27:48.756
Of the historical record.

27:48.823 --> 27:52.059
So how did Seamus wiles
know about them?

27:52.127 --> 27:54.128
Yeah, exactly.

27:54.195 --> 27:57.965
They were apparently
very technologically advanced.

27:58.033 --> 27:59.733
They discovered the vacuum.

27:59.801 --> 28:00.734
Oh, the vacuum cleaner?

28:00.802 --> 28:02.536
No.

28:02.604 --> 28:06.073
The vacuum as in "the source of
all creation and destruction."

28:06.141 --> 28:08.475
Interesting.

28:08.543 --> 28:12.012
This book is useless.
There's nothing here.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.751
What were the numbers
on the first broadcast?

28:17.819 --> 28:19.320
Why?

28:19.387 --> 28:20.688
<i>Well, if you were
to believe the book,</i>

28:20.755 --> 28:22.222
The first people measured
time in months

28:22.290 --> 28:24.224
That had wildly different
numbers of days in them.

28:24.292 --> 28:26.093
But humor me.
What were the numbers?

28:30.565 --> 28:33.667
12...

28:33.735 --> 28:37.338
34, 17...

28:37.405 --> 28:40.507
9, 15, and, uh...

28:40.575 --> 28:42.743
8, 42, 40.

28:42.811 --> 28:44.345
Yeah.

28:44.412 --> 28:45.879
The numbers
of the first broadcast

28:45.947 --> 28:48.115
Correspond exactly
with the numbers in this book.

28:48.183 --> 28:50.617
They match the numbers
of this calendar exactly.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.387
<i>Never thought I'd say this,
but I think Markam's right.</i>

28:53.455 --> 28:55.356
<i>Somehow the number stations
are connected</i>

28:55.423 --> 28:57.291
<i>To these first people.</i>

28:57.359 --> 29:00.060
What the hell does that mean?

29:07.493 --> 29:09.061
It's fascinating.
Remarkable.

29:09.128 --> 29:10.062
Read more.

29:10.129 --> 29:11.897
You don't actually
believe this?

29:11.965 --> 29:15.667
An ancient people who evolved
before the dinosaurs

29:15.735 --> 29:17.636
Just vanished without a trace?

29:17.704 --> 29:19.538
It's... it's absurd.

29:19.605 --> 29:22.541
Why should we be
so arrogant as to assume

29:22.608 --> 29:25.210
That we're the first
homo sapiens to walk the earth.

29:25.278 --> 29:27.612
<i>I mean, history is full
of extinction events...</i>

29:27.680 --> 29:29.948
Climate change,
meteorites, Atlantis.

29:30.016 --> 29:31.450
Atlantis?
Peter, come on.

29:31.517 --> 29:32.451
Help me out here.

29:32.518 --> 29:34.286
I don't know
what I believe yet.

29:34.354 --> 29:36.121
All I know is that the numbers
in their calendar

29:36.189 --> 29:37.923
<i>Correspond with the numbers
of the first broadcast.</i>

29:37.991 --> 29:39.424
That can't just be
a coincidence.

29:39.492 --> 29:41.693
"they were a people
of great technological prowess

29:41.761 --> 29:43.695
"who made
the ultimate discovery.

29:43.763 --> 29:45.931
"a mechanism known to them
as the vacuum,

29:45.999 --> 29:47.966
<i>"containing at once</i>

29:48.034 --> 29:50.469
Both the power to create
and to destroy."

29:50.536 --> 29:52.070
"the vacuum."

29:52.138 --> 29:54.306
What a wonderful name, and it
verifies some of my theories.

29:54.374 --> 29:56.541
What theories, Walter?
Create and destroy what?

29:56.609 --> 29:58.343
Well, everything.

29:58.411 --> 30:00.278
Many religions speak
of such a power.

30:00.346 --> 30:02.381
<i>And science,
the big bang,</i>

30:02.448 --> 30:04.549
And it's counterpart,
the big crunch.

30:04.617 --> 30:07.019
The universe expanding
and contracting

30:07.086 --> 30:08.487
And expanding...

30:08.554 --> 30:11.089
<i>An endless cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

30:11.157 --> 30:12.591
Okay, let's run with that.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.059
<i>Let's say that these
first people</i>

30:14.127 --> 30:15.961
<i>Did create this mechanism</i>

30:16.029 --> 30:19.164
And then somehow translated
into a code.

30:19.232 --> 30:21.800
And now someone is wiping
people's memories

30:21.868 --> 30:23.402
To keep the code a secret?

30:23.469 --> 30:26.071
Not so surprising.

30:26.139 --> 30:29.074
It's the key to the universe.

30:29.142 --> 30:30.909
It's a secret worth protecting.

30:30.977 --> 30:32.577
Hey.

30:32.645 --> 30:33.845
<i>Sorry I'm late,</i>

30:33.913 --> 30:36.515
But I thought these
might cheer you up.

30:39.819 --> 30:41.319
Oh!
Malassadas!

30:41.387 --> 30:42.954
Oh, it's wonderful.

30:44.457 --> 30:45.824
Anything new in the book?

30:45.892 --> 30:47.459
I'm sure the numbers
hold the answers,

30:47.527 --> 30:49.094
But beyond that,
nothing tangible.

30:49.162 --> 30:50.595
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

30:50.663 --> 30:53.331
Hey, Walter?

30:53.399 --> 30:56.601
<i>Come here.
Take a look at this.</i>

31:00.039 --> 31:01.106
This transistor

31:01.174 --> 31:04.176
Is newer than the rest of them.

31:06.979 --> 31:08.547
Somebody must have replaced it.

31:08.614 --> 31:12.017
It's polish,
and it's military grade.

31:12.085 --> 31:13.585
There's only couple places
that are licensed

31:13.653 --> 31:15.854
To sell parts like that,
and they're all regulated,

31:15.922 --> 31:17.222
Which means
that you have to give

31:17.290 --> 31:18.824
A verified address to buy one.

31:18.891 --> 31:21.526
I'm gonna make
some phone calls.

31:21.594 --> 31:23.862
May I borrow that?

31:24.964 --> 31:29.734
I feel a bowel movement
coming on.

31:29.802 --> 31:32.704
Walter.

31:32.772 --> 31:35.006
Can you tell Peter
I'll be back?

31:35.074 --> 31:36.808
I'm gonna let broyles know
where we're at.

31:50.957 --> 31:53.425
Avocado, cucumber, and cheese.

31:53.493 --> 31:57.662
In 1974, the c.I.A.
Asked me to develop

31:57.730 --> 31:59.764
The best sandwich
for clarity of thought.

31:59.832 --> 32:01.399
There's too much
information here.

32:01.467 --> 32:02.901
But of course the chips

32:02.969 --> 32:04.703
Are just because I like
foods that crunch.

32:07.106 --> 32:09.274
There has to be a pattern here.

32:09.342 --> 32:10.876
Every code relies on a pattern.

32:10.943 --> 32:12.878
I just need to see it.
But you can't.

32:12.945 --> 32:15.247
<i>That's your problem.</i>

32:15.314 --> 32:17.382
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

32:17.450 --> 32:19.384
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

32:19.452 --> 32:22.320
No, I-I simply meant that
to break the code

32:22.388 --> 32:24.289
You would have to think
like they did,

32:24.357 --> 32:26.925
<i>And they lived millions
and millions of years ago.</i>

32:26.993 --> 32:30.629
I-I mean, for one thing,
look at their concept of time.

32:30.696 --> 32:32.697
Nine days in a month?

32:32.765 --> 32:34.933
<i>If you're not going
to eat those chips,</i>

32:35.001 --> 32:38.970
May I?

32:39.038 --> 32:42.607
What? What?
What happened?

32:42.675 --> 32:44.309
Here.

32:44.377 --> 32:45.377
Read me this calendar.

32:45.444 --> 32:46.611
How many days are
in each month?

32:46.679 --> 32:48.180
Why?

32:48.247 --> 32:50.482
Humor me.

32:50.550 --> 32:54.920
The first two are 12 and 34.

32:54.987 --> 32:58.089
<i>Then 17, 9, 15.</i>

32:58.157 --> 32:59.925
What are you thinking, Watson?

32:59.992 --> 33:03.528
That maybe what we're missing
is a cipher matrix...

33:03.596 --> 33:05.897
Our decoder ring.

33:08.935 --> 33:12.370
Okay, what are the next months?

33:12.438 --> 33:16.808
8, 42, 40, 27...

33:28.721 --> 33:32.023
We got a problem.

33:33.926 --> 33:36.228
The secretary said
we weren't supposed to meet.

33:36.295 --> 33:37.662
Well, the secretary is
on the other side.

33:37.730 --> 33:39.130
He can't foresee
every turn of events.

33:39.198 --> 33:41.566
Now, you replaced a transistor
in one of the boxes.

33:41.634 --> 33:43.401
Polish...
they found it.

33:43.469 --> 33:46.137
They're tracking the sale
as we speak.

33:46.205 --> 33:47.672
Who are these people?

33:47.740 --> 33:50.242
Look, you were sloppy.
You've jeopardized the mission.

33:50.309 --> 33:52.244
I'm supposed to upload
another pulse tomorrow.

33:52.311 --> 33:53.678
I think you've done enough.

33:53.746 --> 33:55.046
We've got their attention.

33:55.114 --> 33:57.415
There's no need to hurt
any more innocent people.

33:57.483 --> 33:58.717
What do they say on this side?

33:59.885 --> 34:01.152
"all's fair in love and war"?

34:01.220 --> 34:03.922
If they were in our shoes,
they would do exactly

34:03.990 --> 34:06.324
What we're doing.
Dunham.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.426
<i>We've got an
address on the suspect.</i>

34:08.494 --> 34:11.429
<i>Joseph feller.
989 Nelson street, Medford.</i>

34:11.496 --> 34:12.630
<i>We're en route with backup.</i>

34:12.697 --> 34:15.000
Okay, I'm on my way.

34:15.067 --> 34:16.601
They're coming.

34:16.668 --> 34:18.069
<i>Where should I go?</i>

34:18.137 --> 34:21.239
Do you have any information
on my next mission?

34:21.306 --> 34:23.708
Yeah, I do.

34:29.348 --> 34:30.514
Olivia's already here.

34:41.893 --> 34:44.195
It's a shape-shifter.

34:52.471 --> 34:54.505
Olivia...

34:54.572 --> 34:56.007
Thank God you're all right.

34:56.074 --> 34:57.475
Tell me what happened.

34:57.543 --> 34:59.277
He... he came at me.
I had no choice.

34:59.345 --> 35:00.912
But you're all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.481
But, uh, he was coming out
as I got here, and...

35:03.549 --> 35:06.318
But you're all right?
Uh-huh.

35:13.386 --> 35:14.453
Any breakthroughs?

35:14.520 --> 35:15.454
I don't know.

35:15.521 --> 35:17.155
I thought that maybe
if I added up

35:17.223 --> 35:19.057
All the numbers.

35:19.125 --> 35:20.926
Well, keep at it.

35:20.993 --> 35:24.296
<i>And I wouldn't go
in the bathroom, dear.</i>

35:52.358 --> 35:53.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on!

35:53.659 --> 35:54.693
I need to look at that body.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.495
You got a pair of gloves
on you?

35:56.562 --> 35:57.863
What is it?

35:57.930 --> 36:00.031
Well, it makes sense now
why Walter couldn't figure out

36:00.099 --> 36:01.700
The tech that emitted
the amnesia pulse.

36:01.768 --> 36:03.101
It must have come
from the other side.

36:03.169 --> 36:05.370
Which suggests walternate knows
what the numbers mean.

36:05.438 --> 36:09.040
<i>He must be the one
protecting the code.</i>

36:15.782 --> 36:17.783
What?

36:17.850 --> 36:20.352
Data storage unit.

36:20.420 --> 36:22.354
I'm guessing we're not gonna get
anything off of that.

36:22.422 --> 36:23.555
It's toast.

36:23.623 --> 36:25.857
Dunham.

36:25.925 --> 36:28.226
I think I cracked the code.

36:28.294 --> 36:30.395
<i>I know what
number stations are.</i>

36:30.463 --> 36:32.664
It's a coordinate system.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.299
These numbers
indicate locations.

36:34.367 --> 36:35.734
Latitude and longitude.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.569
<i>35 degrees
and 40 minutes south</i>

36:37.637 --> 36:39.504
By 58 degrees
and 40 minutes West,

36:39.572 --> 36:41.706
That's just outside
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

36:41.774 --> 36:44.009
<i>All of these numbers
indicate specific locations</i>

36:44.076 --> 36:47.078
<i>On a globe...
Ethiopia, Spain, China.</i>

36:47.146 --> 36:49.147
So what's there at the end
of the points?

36:49.215 --> 36:52.184
So far as I can tell,
nothing special...

36:52.251 --> 36:54.219
A farmhouse,
public swimming pool,

36:54.287 --> 36:56.321
<i>And random stuff like that.</i>

36:56.389 --> 36:59.424
We're not looking
for a man-made structure.

36:59.492 --> 37:02.327
If this message is millions
of years old,

37:02.395 --> 37:04.763
Then we're likely talking
about something

37:04.831 --> 37:07.732
<i>Buried beneath the earth.</i>

37:07.800 --> 37:10.535
How many locations?

37:10.603 --> 37:12.170
I haven't finished
plugging in all the numbers,

37:12.238 --> 37:14.940
But so far, 22.

37:17.243 --> 37:20.479
And what's the closest one?

37:39.232 --> 37:40.732
What'd I miss?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.501
Oh, uh, thank you.
Nothing yet.

37:42.568 --> 37:45.036
They just pulled up
an old buried football, so...

37:45.104 --> 37:47.272
I had to go back.
Forgot to say "skim."

37:47.340 --> 37:50.008
you walked there twice?

37:50.076 --> 37:52.444
You didn't have to do that.
Well, I had a motive.

37:52.512 --> 37:55.580
It's the little things
that make me irresistible.

37:58.684 --> 38:00.652
What if he's right?

38:00.720 --> 38:03.588
Walter?
Right about what?

38:03.656 --> 38:05.090
I've been thinking, Peter.

38:05.157 --> 38:07.726
Your father's concerned about
building Walternate's device.

38:07.793 --> 38:10.128
What if it does mean
the destruction

38:10.196 --> 38:12.797
Of one universe
or... or the other?

38:16.168 --> 38:18.937
We don't know that yet.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.642
That's not really my point.

38:27.346 --> 38:30.782
If you knew that only...

38:30.850 --> 38:32.951
One of our worlds could survive

38:33.019 --> 38:35.453
And if it was up to you,
and you alone,

38:35.521 --> 38:38.023
To defend your side...

38:40.359 --> 38:42.527
You'd have no choice, right?

38:42.595 --> 38:46.698
I mean, you would have to do
what you had to do...

38:46.766 --> 38:50.468
No matter the cost
to protect...

38:50.536 --> 38:52.203
Our world.

38:57.009 --> 39:01.212
There are billions
of innocent people over there...

39:01.280 --> 39:02.314
Just like here...

39:02.381 --> 39:05.917
People with jobs,
families, lives.

39:10.056 --> 39:13.058
I got to believe
there's another way.

39:14.727 --> 39:18.530
And whatever my part
in all of this is...

39:18.598 --> 39:22.233
I got to believe
there's another way.

39:24.303 --> 39:26.371
There's always hope, right?

39:28.341 --> 39:31.309
<i>We got something!</i>

40:15.321 --> 40:17.389
Oh, my.

40:25.564 --> 40:27.332
Dunham.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.234
<i>I just identified
the last coordinates...</i>

40:29.301 --> 40:32.170
Milton, Massachusetts,
the house where the first piece

40:32.238 --> 40:34.105
Of Walternate's machine
was buried.

40:37.610 --> 40:39.244
<i>Do you think it's possible</i>

40:39.311 --> 40:41.513
That these locations
are all a part of the machine,

40:41.580 --> 40:44.182
<i>That Walternate's device
is the vacuum</i>

40:44.250 --> 40:47.552
<i>Described
in the first people book?</i>

40:47.620 --> 40:51.056
Uh, yes.

40:51.123 --> 40:53.958
<i>I think they're one
and the same.</i>

41:01.534 --> 41:03.968
Astrid finished the code.

41:04.036 --> 41:07.439
There are 37 more locations.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.142
<i>In that case...</i>

41:11.210 --> 41:12.477
It seems we have work to do.

41:12.545 --> 41:15.313
<i>We have to recover
the pieces,</i>

41:15.381 --> 41:19.017
Assemble it,
and figure out how it works.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.556
<i>Okay, let's clear this out!</i>

41:26.392 --> 41:28.126
Creation and destruction...

41:28.194 --> 41:30.795
I suppose we'll have to hope
for the former.

42:21.547 --> 42:23.281
Dunham.

42:23.349 --> 42:24.983
<i>Agent Dunham,
this is Brandon Fayette.</i>

42:25.050 --> 42:27.719
<i>Oh, Brandon, hey.
Uh, I'm on my way.</i>

42:27.787 --> 42:29.053
<i>I should be about an hour.</i>

42:29.121 --> 42:30.722
Actually,
that's why I'm calling.

42:30.790 --> 42:33.658
The secretary has decided
to postpone today's procedure.

42:33.726 --> 42:35.627
So when do you
want me to come in?

42:35.694 --> 42:38.463
<i>It may not be necessary.</i>

42:38.531 --> 42:40.832
<i>We'll let you know.</i>

42:40.900 --> 42:42.834
Okay.

42:42.902 --> 42:46.171
Bye.

42:48.507 --> 42:51.276
<i>You have to get out of here.</i>

42:51.343 --> 42:54.546
<i>You know why they canceled
the last test, don't you?</i>

42:54.613 --> 42:57.448
Whatever they needed from you,
they have it now.

42:59.218 --> 43:02.854
<i>It's not safe for you here
anymore, Olivia.</i>

43:02.922 --> 43:05.790
You have to go home.
