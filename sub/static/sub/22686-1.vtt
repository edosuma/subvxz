(CHILD LAUGHING)

00:25.651 --> 00:27.574
Have you guys seen the
new Kate Winslet movie?

00:27.778 --> 00:29.496
It's great. You
should check it out.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.540
Apparently I'm told I
look just like her.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.038
And hopefully my acting career

00:34.243 --> 00:35.244
will take off just like hers.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.795
That is not gonna help.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.874
She wants your autograph
signed with her pencil skirt.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.334
It's okay, she'll get the hint.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.044
I'll get you guys some sugar.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.845
I think I'm gonna be sick.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.303
What? Th e little guy?

(SIGHS)

00:55.639 --> 00:57.107
What, the waitress?

00:57.307 --> 00:58.524
She's only doing that
because she thinks

00:58.725 --> 01:00.272
I'm gonna call my agent
and tell him I found

01:00.477 --> 01:02.730
the next Jennifer Lawrence on
my flight to Cartegentina.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.282
Oh, oh, oops, I'm so sorry, sir.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.701
Is everything okay?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.370
Um, no, can we get a
ginger ale, please?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.369
No, it's fine. I don't need one.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.291
Oh, is the little one
creating a fuss?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.995
L-low far along are you, sugar?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.173
Way too far to put a stop to it.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.546
I think this trend
of having a Babymoon

01:23.750 --> 01:25.878
is just absolutely fabulous.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.463
Well, it's the last vacation

fort worth, Texas,

01:34.344 --> 01:36.472
who reads a lot of
Stella Adler...

01:36.680 --> 01:37.977
Thank you for your advice,

01:38.181 --> 01:39.774
but we can do without
the down-home wisdom.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.148
I simply asked for a drink,
so if you could go get that,

01:42.352 --> 01:45.322
- bring it unopened, please, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.993
And if you could please stop
touching me, that would be great.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.995
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.993
Unopened.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.703
You are such a dick.

Yeah, but I'm your dick, honey.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.369
You like the country?

02:40.994 --> 02:46.376
We go one way and now
we go a better way.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.550
- Watch out there.
- The little puppies.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.968
I know.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.842
They're totally gonna
cross the street.

he has any plans

02:56.218 --> 02:57.561
is the problem here.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.937
That was almost as
long as that flight.

- Si.

- Uh, Mr. and Mrs.

- In your mind, maybe,

03:29.459 --> 03:32.053
but in my computer, no existe.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.006
Which, it does not exist.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.434
- Just give the passports.
- It's okay. It's okay, I got it.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.853
It's okay, it's our
celebrity cover name.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.851

back to the room.

- Yep.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.818
- Mickey Vann?
- I get it.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.619
- Don't get VHI.
- Um, just ensure that we're on

03:56.820 --> 03:58.197
the first or second floor.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.622
I just get really dizzy.

premier bungalow.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.915
Is that first, third, you
know, second, maybe?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.622
Technically speaking,
it's on the third floor,

04:06.830 --> 04:10.130
but you feel like you're on...

04:10.292 --> 04:13.011
The floor that you are on.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.713
- It'll be okay, baby.
- Do you have a um...

04:14.921 --> 04:15.763
- A Baño?
- Yes.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.011
There is some, please.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.307
To your left, then make a right.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.760
And then make a right.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.892
If you get lost, just
say band, por favor.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.689
- Just say Baño.
- Baño, por... fine.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.143
Yes, you look very nice,
so they will sense

04:27.350 --> 04:30.820
that you mean "por favor,"
even if you don't say it.

- Is yours?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.747
- Si.
- Okay, Muy Bien. Felicidades!

Yes. No.

- Honey.
- You should love it.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.381
I cannot do a zip line.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.805
- Why?
- It's not safe.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.307
Cartegentina's best
rock climbing.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.306
Safe.

You know what, it's okay, baby.
You know what we'll do?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.017
We'll get dressed, we'll go in.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.600
We'll go to the booze cruise,
we'll get our dance on.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.105
Hmm? Shaka, Shaka, Shaka.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.812
Sounds like fun for you.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.447
- Oh, right, you get motion sickness.
- Yeah.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.991
It's okay, we'll just...
We'll get changed,

05:16.191 --> 05:18.034
we'll go lie by the pool.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.363
Yeah, thanks.

Ooh'. Not bad for a third
world country, huh?

05:29.287 --> 05:32.382
This room is way
over our budget.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.301
(GASPS) oh, honey, you've
gotta see these aboriginals

05:35.502 --> 05:36.469
with their fancy masks.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.047
Is it Mardi Gras over here?

05:38.255 --> 05:41.475
Uh, no, those are gas masks.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.848
Yeah, people are preparing for
the political demonstrations

05:44.052 --> 05:46.180
against our not-very-effective
government.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.811
That was not on the
trip advisor review.

explode that one.

to displease you I didn't...

06:20.297 --> 06:22.550

06:22.757 --> 06:26.603
- Okay.
- Gracias.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.555
What's Ceviche?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.724
It's raw fish. I can't eat it.

someone a little more qualified

06:37.731 --> 06:39.733
to send the rest of our baggage?
Thanks.

Hanna, honey, that's a
little bit paranoid.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.163
Do not call me that.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.918
Seriously.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.543

Honey, see this?

07:02.505 --> 07:03.882
This window?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.094
- This is a separate country.
- Yes. (GIGGLES)

07:07.302 --> 07:09.805
They have their own
cultures and customs, hmm?

07:10.013 --> 07:13.187
But this is our time

07:13.391 --> 07:16.270
and we can do whatever we want.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.980
And if you want a
little bit of this,

07:18.188 --> 07:19.314
- you know what Tm sums, sugar?
- Mm-mmm.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.991
Mm-mmm.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.572

07:25.779 --> 07:28.248
What color do you think
for the pool, honey?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.452
- Come here.
- It's okay.

something you don't wanna do.

Oh! Okay, yeah,
this is happening.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.259
Okay, we're goin' for it.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.060
No, it's okay, honey, it's okay.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.314
We're okay.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.516
We're okay.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.477
- It's safer that way.
- I bet.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.484
What about your jewelry?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.611
Not worth it.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.533

away from the jackals.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.936
Looks like I brought
you right to the den.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.320
Okay, hold on. Let me
just get my footing.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.022
- Oh!
- It's okay, honey.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.405
- I don't want you to fall back.
- Thank you.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.402
- Mm-hmm.
- Yup.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.984
We're just making a scene.

- (LAUGHING)

Asshole, yes.

Do you know who that is?

09:12.761 --> 09:13.933
Who, what?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.152
- That's Fabrice Mancini.
- I should know him from...

09:20.351 --> 09:22.149
Do you know “friends," “two
and a half men, “" seinfeld“?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.651
- Yeah, of course. Okay, he had
nothing - to do with those,

09:24.856 --> 09:26.950
but he always had a knack
for getting his lower grade

09:27.150 --> 09:28.276
sitcoms to air right after them.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.204
- Made a fortune.
- That's great.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.122
Well, maybe he'll recognize you

09:33.323 --> 09:34.870
and you'll feel right at home.

(LAUGHING)

- Uh!
- What are you doing?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.294
- Is he looking?
- No.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.172
I'm gonna go to the pool.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.888
- Do you want help?
- Nope, I got it.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.512
I'm good, thanks.

You look great, honey.

- Do that next time.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.812
Oh, okay.

Just make sure that
you send it out...

Honey, I'm... I... I...

11:28.021 --> 11:29.398
Hanna, honey, it's
just the receipt.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.404
It's for a couple of drinks.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.702
I can't drink.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.075
No, baby, it's not for you.
It's for Fabrice.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.906
Huh? It's a classy move, right?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.242
Sending over drinks and he
has to at least thank me.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.623
Gives me an opening.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.204
There it is.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.416
Hey, sir, this gentleman down
there sent these for you.

make this many pesos?

- Hey, great idea, honey.

Rest up for dinner,
we're here to relax.

I need you to go
over to those girls

saw someone famous.

- Okay?

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, um, maybe, uh,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.999
maybe "famous" is
too pretentious.

- Really cool.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.342
- Wow.
- Wow, wow, wow.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.220
Wow. Okay, okay.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.062
MAN: Okay, okay.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

12:49.811 --> 12:53.156
Hola, Señora.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

12:55.775 --> 12:56.992
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

13:07.787 --> 13:09.710
- Oh, shit.
- (SPEAKING SPANISH)

13:09.914 --> 13:11.461
I am so sorry.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.963
The Jewel is fine.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.215
More importantly, Miss,
are you all right?

13:15.420 --> 13:18.640
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.138
That jewelry is
absolutely beautiful.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.969
May I ask who the designer is?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.305
Uh, it's me, actually.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.483
- Absolutely breathtaking.
- Thank you.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.778
I have a small line in a
boutique in Los Angeles.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.356
I will pay for any damage
there is to that bracelet.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.486
Not necessary.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.533
I'm the buyer for this store.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.453
We have many hotel chains at all
the top resorts across the world

13:40.653 --> 13:42.280
and I would like to talk
to you about your line.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.332
- No.
- Yes.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.830
Wait, really?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.878
Unless you're not interested.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.918
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

13:55.126 --> 13:58.721
Yeah! You, you... I
saw you over there

13:58.921 --> 14:01.470
you look like a boxer.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.800
- I'm a golden Glover.
- No kidding.

14:03.009 --> 14:03.976
- Yes, sir.
- Golden gloves.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.975
Trace McEvans!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.522
Dio Mio.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.225
May I please have
your autograph?

14:10.433 --> 14:13.812
Uh, yeah, certainly. You know, hey,
happens all the time, you know?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.068
Especially in the larger
entertainment markets.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.491
I mean, glad to see that my
I.2 million view ah base

14:18.691 --> 14:20.238
is growing internationally.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.820
Here you go, kid.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.701
First famous autograph, hmm?

14:23.905 --> 14:26.829
Actually, I got bono's
autograph last month.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.831
He was here for a
benefit concert.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.708
Are you as famous as Bono?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.747
That's a good question.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.880
I, uh, I, too, am
in a famous band.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.929
Wait, like a band like u2?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.097
Well, no, we only
had the one album,

14:42.298 --> 14:45.142
but our sous, "hard
rock from the heart,"

14:45.343 --> 14:47.812
was number one for five weeks,
three of them consecutive.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.434
Stop the show!

14:49.639 --> 14:53.689
Yes, I know who you are.
You're famous for... what?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.442
Uh, you know, I did a
little bit of TV hosting,

14:56.646 --> 14:57.522
I was in a band.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.108
He's famous for cheating.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.410
Somebody can be famous for this?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.913
You heard him. Every
week a million people

15:06.114 --> 15:08.367
would tune in to watch
his shitty reality show.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.791
Uh! You should have seen it.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.212
They take this D-list
celebrity couple,

15:13.413 --> 15:17.759
they stick him in the house,
fill it with morally dubious

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
cable TV floozies,
while his girlfriend

15:20.169 --> 15:22.547
watches everything
happening on a monitor.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.177
Uh! It was brutal.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.884
Ooh! And the best
part, be modest...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.094
Let me guess, he cheated?

15:28.302 --> 15:30.020
With every single one of them.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.098
(LAUGHS)

15:32.306 --> 15:33.182
Wow.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.149
Class act.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.775
What was your nickname?
What did they call you?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.982
You were the prince of penis,

15:41.190 --> 15:42.817
or, um, royal dickhead

15:43.025 --> 15:45.824
what did they... something.
What did they call you?

15:45.987 --> 15:48.410
Yeah, that was a... that was
a tough time in my life,

15:48.614 --> 15:49.957
and, you know, before
I settled down

15:50.158 --> 15:53.162
and, as you know, it's TV
and there's no actual...

15:53.369 --> 15:54.621
I mean, it's... It's
for a show, you know.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.207
The producers they changed
the name of the show.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.917
It was actually supposed to
be "lifestyle of a rocker,"

15:59.083 --> 16:01.632
and you know, they
made me do some things

16:01.836 --> 16:03.713
that I didn't really,
you know, wanna do.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.548
What did they call you?

16:10.011 --> 16:12.685
- King of...
- King of infidelity! That's it.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.768
Not even a good nickname, really.
It doesn't roll.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.525
If it was me, my show,
"Sultan of Shlong."

16:19.729 --> 16:23.154
Right? A little mysterious,
a little Turkish sounding.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.825
Not even a good nickname.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.370
Looks like he didn't want
your autograph after all,

16:27.570 --> 16:28.947
king of assholes.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.281
That's a good one, too.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.787
That really is. Think
of the t-shirts.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.743
Beautiful view you
guys got up here.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.673
- Señora Mcevans!
- Uh!

16:42.877 --> 16:44.504
Como Va Todo?

16:44.712 --> 16:45.634
Uh...

16:45.838 --> 16:47.966
Is everything to your liking?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.643
Comos... yes! Everything's fine.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.811
(CHUCKLES) please, allow me

16:53.012 --> 16:54.980
to escort you to your room.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.899
- Gracias.
- De nada.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.976
Wish I could say
more than "gracias."

16:59.185 --> 17:00.482
That's very good,
your pronunciation.

17:00.686 --> 17:05.156
Constructed in the i9305,
just above the ruins,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.575
if you can look out there,

17:06.776 --> 17:10.155
the ancient ruins of
the Cueva de Amor,

17:10.363 --> 17:13.162
which is in English,
"cave of love."

17:13.366 --> 17:16.540
And is built where the
indigenous villagers would go

17:16.743 --> 17:18.541
for romantic trysts.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.419
I, myself, went for
a romantic tryst,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.796
and I'm still trysting today.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.923
- With my wife.
- Oh, okay.

17:25.127 --> 17:29.553
And now, unfortunately, it's
just a rebel stronghold.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.385
Rebels? Is that dangerous?

17:32.593 --> 17:35.187
The people, they would come
from all over to work,

17:35.388 --> 17:38.858
but the current government
put a stop to what they call

17:39.058 --> 17:40.105
foreign invaders, and they said,

17:40.309 --> 17:41.936
"a la Hui, Hui, Hui," you know?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.942
Mm-hmm, yeah, we have people
like that in America, too,

17:44.146 --> 17:46.240
but we tricked them all
into living Arizona.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.446
Brilliant, Señora. May your
little one share your optimism

17:51.654 --> 17:53.031
and make the world
a better place.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.412
And here we are, your room.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.666
Whoo! Yes! Baby, I'm in there!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.009
We are back in business.
(GRUNTS)

18:05.209 --> 18:07.382
So, your pandering
went well, I suppose?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.807
- Oh, babe, he was such a fan of my work.
- That's great.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.762
(GRUNTS) yes! This is such a
huge opportunity for us, huh?

18:14.969 --> 18:18.098
- Us?
- Baby, don't do that, this is too good.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.274
I already said "great."

18:20.474 --> 18:22.397
Baby, I have a meeting
with Fabrice.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.320
If I can impress this guy, huh?

18:24.478 --> 18:27.823
He can put me on his new TV show.
A musical.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.118
Right after the new "glee" spinoff.
It can't fail.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.820
- Do you know what that means?
- Love scenes

18:32.028 --> 18:33.996
with someone not as
cool as Jane lynch?

18:34.196 --> 18:38.497
No, this means like not... not chasing
after my own celebrity hot spots

18:38.701 --> 18:39.827
and tipping off
my own paparazzi.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.629
I mean, a real acting job.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.456
Baby, consistent work.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.962
You know? Paying better
than any reality gig.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.719
Huh? You know what I mean?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.762
I'm meeting with
Fabrice tonight, okay?

18:50.963 --> 18:56.060
I'm gonna... uh, white...
white tank, shorts?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.022
Pink collar, Navy slacks.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.644
Hey, baby, why don't you...
Why don't you like

19:01.849 --> 19:03.351
make yourself a tea,
just relax, you know,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.607
have a nap and then, and
then we'll go like at night

19:05.811 --> 19:08.109
and we'll just have a
nice stroll on the beach.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.783
You know, a nap sounds perfect.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.081
Great. Mm-mmm!

19:20.284 --> 19:22.378
(MUSIC PLAYING)

19:30.961 --> 19:32.053
Fabrice!

19:32.254 --> 19:35.053
Uh, hey! Where'd the
ladies go, huh?

19:35.257 --> 19:38.386
They clock out on me
when the sun goes down.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.313
But, I'm here to pick
up the night shift.

19:41.514 --> 19:46.691
Yeah, well, I mean, they seem
to be a little distracted.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.524
We're not all as lucky as you
are, you little cock blocker.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.483
Cute. I like the shirt.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.909
Very David Cassidy.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.327
Yeah, my... my wife
picked it out.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.495
I got us a table.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.573
Us?

19:58.781 --> 20:01.330
I hope this will be
comfortable enough for you.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.037
The hotel has the best
restaurant in the city.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.088
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:11.252 --> 20:14.131
All I wanna do is work hard,

20:14.338 --> 20:15.760
make a shit ton of money,

20:15.965 --> 20:19.139
clock out at 5:00, go
home, be with my family.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.720
- Oh, is that all?
- That's it.

20:20.928 --> 20:21.599
- That's it?
- Yeah.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.021
Oh, yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.316
That sounds like the
position someone earns

20:25.516 --> 20:27.610
after 20 years at
the grindstone.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.778
Those are long hours.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.198
That's the one thing
my stay-at-home,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.150
bored ex-wives never understood.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.612
All that time at
work is required

20:37.820 --> 20:40.619
to get where you wanna go and they
just think... they never got it.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.042
I mean, listen, I think that if
you're both sound as a couple

20:43.242 --> 20:45.665
and you, um, you know,
you're both successful,

20:45.870 --> 20:48.373
that you avoid making
those kinds of mistakes.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.256
Well, excuse me, who
are you to judge me?

20:52.460 --> 20:54.883
You... you, no, I'm
talking to you.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.556
You're a literal fame whore.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.600
You were on a show
and your talent

20:59.800 --> 21:02.428
was banging chicks that
you didn't know...

21:02.636 --> 21:04.934
To get more famous. And
you're judging me?

21:05.139 --> 21:06.732
You're no better than
these girls at the bar.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.559
And you, you're actually... You know what?
You're worse.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.738
You're the worst kind because
you expect all the attention,

21:11.937 --> 21:13.735
yet you do nothing for it.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.158
And you're judging me.
That's awesome.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.115
I... I... Uh, I can't tell if...

21:18.319 --> 21:19.491
Are you serious?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.155
I can't tell if you're
kidding or if...

21:21.322 --> 21:22.915
No, this is not my kidding face.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.833
Fabrice, I'm really...

21:25.034 --> 21:26.661
I think you got the
wrong impression here.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.212
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.709
Okay, well, here's the
impression that I have

21:29.914 --> 21:31.587
and you tell me if
I'm right or wrong.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.965
My impression is that
you crashed my dinner

21:35.169 --> 21:37.797
so that you could tell
me, in some long-winded

21:37.963 --> 21:42.890
Self-Grandizing way, how wonderful
you would be on my new TV musical.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.514
- (SIGHS)
- Am I close?

21:46.722 --> 21:51.979
I'm not... I'm not gonna lie.
That that would be a dream.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.779
Yeah, as in fairies and elves

21:53.979 --> 21:55.856
and Santa having sex
with the Easter bunny.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.614
It would be a dream.
You, in my musical.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.946
- I mean...
- Although, you know what?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.155
You came here like a
man to talk to me,

22:03.364 --> 22:05.833
tell me your credits. How many
musicals have you performed in?

22:06.033 --> 22:09.162
Go ahead, tick them off.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.589
(SIGHS) um... well, I, I...

22:11.789 --> 22:14.838
Do you have any actual
acting experience?

22:15.042 --> 22:16.840
Something where you
haven't been on camera

22:17.044 --> 22:20.674
just playing this shitty version
of the person that you are?

22:23.133 --> 22:25.056
Tell me about your
line of jewelry.

22:25.261 --> 22:29.186
Um, I do mainly rings,
um, bangles, necklaces.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.815
I... I meant the inspiration
for your jewelry.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.941
Boredom and desperation?

22:40.901 --> 22:44.246
Had I such a woman with
obvious artistic talent,

22:44.446 --> 22:47.950
I would not let her suffer one
excruciating moment of boredom.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.412
Stop it.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.671
I'm very serious about
carrying your line.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.714
Well, that's why I'm here,

22:58.919 --> 23:01.638
to see how interested
you are in my jewelry.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.305
Vastly.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.394
This is why you'll never
be anything but a joke.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.225
You have no substance.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.312
You can't just want something
to happen and wish upon a star

23:15.519 --> 23:17.613
and expect it to happen.
That's not how it works.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.861
You want a career,
you want success?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.487
- Yes.
- Well, then work for it!

23:21.692 --> 23:24.070
You think I went
into show business

23:24.278 --> 23:27.373
hoping to do a series of
successful second-rate

23:27.573 --> 23:31.453
television shows with
horrible laugh tracks?

23:31.660 --> 23:34.914
No! I would give
my left nut to do

23:35.122 --> 23:36.920
a prestige drama
with Morgan Freeman,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.585
but it's not
knocking on my door.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.426
They don't just give those
shows away, do they?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.598
- No?
- No.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.727
So, what did I do?
I kept working.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.225
I kept working and working
and hopefully one day,

23:50.429 --> 23:53.603
someday it all comes together.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.778
But I... This is not about you.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.651
And I don't wanna be this guy.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.611
I don't wanna be the asshole
that has to tell you the truth,

24:01.815 --> 24:04.819
that none of your idiot
friends in show business

24:05.027 --> 24:06.825
- have the balls to tell you.
- Sure.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.622
But, you know, I'm me. You
know what I'm saying?

24:08.822 --> 24:10.324
That's just who I am.

24:10.532 --> 24:15.208
I didn't get to where I am by
sugarcoating bowel movements,

24:15.412 --> 24:17.790
especially with people
I'm in business with.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.753
Now, you wanna be realistic?
Okay.

24:21.961 --> 24:27.263
Now the next time one of these
opportunities comes up,

24:27.466 --> 24:29.468
you think about this,

24:29.677 --> 24:32.146
maybe you wanna do some
high profile porn?

24:32.346 --> 24:36.476
When one of these i6 and pregnant
reality star girls turns i8,

24:36.684 --> 24:38.152
you give me a call.

24:38.352 --> 24:41.731
I know a guy, and we will
make some money together.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.992
Thank you for your
time, fabrice.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.539
Mm-hmm.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.877
Hey!

25:00.082 --> 25:01.800
Anyway, that was
basically the end of it

25:02.001 --> 25:04.504
and we never saw each other
again and all the better for it

25:04.712 --> 25:07.636
- because I didn't like her anyway.
- That's good, then.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.639
Excuse me, can you
bring two desserts?

25:10.843 --> 25:13.687
All for me, but put
them in front of her.

25:13.887 --> 25:14.979
Thank you.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.807
How did you know my favorite?

25:17.016 --> 25:21.021
Well, look, you don't want
anything to happen to your thighs.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.071
So, I'll do it with mine, yeah?

25:25.691 --> 25:27.284
Uh...

25:31.321 --> 25:34.575
I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong idea.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.253
Or maybe you gave
me the wrong idea.

25:41.582 --> 25:45.587
This... this meal has nothing
to do with jewelry, does it?

25:45.794 --> 25:48.798
Everything has everything
to do with jewelry.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.724
I suppose I have not been
completely clear with you.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.803
I noticed you were with a man
who some of the hotel staff

25:54.011 --> 25:58.141
says is well known, and a big part
of marketing is celebrity placement.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.522
If I could get some photos of
him with some of our pieces,

26:01.727 --> 26:05.027
I can almost guarantee that
we can carry your line

26:05.230 --> 26:06.447
in this location for a season,

26:06.607 --> 26:08.860
see how it goes.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.202
That is a lovely offer.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.750
And this is a lovely dinner.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.496
Waiter!

26:20.704 --> 26:22.422
At least I don't follow
around real talent

26:22.623 --> 26:24.796
like some sort of TV afterbirth.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.006
- Oh, that's what I should have said.
- HANNA: Waiter?

26:33.258 --> 26:36.558
I'm just gonna have
to excuse myself.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.686
Hanna, are you okay?

26:41.350 --> 26:43.603
You know what'? You too
can jerk each other off.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.280
My arms are tired.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.983
I'll just say I'm not
opposed to the idea.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.904
Are you upsetting my wife?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.659
That was not my intention.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.242
- Mister...
- homer Simpson.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.168
Funny.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.371
Marge never mentioned
she was married.

27:06.792 --> 27:12.299
- Sir, will you be paying?
- Yes.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.679
Although I'm not sure what for.

27:17.719 --> 27:18.811
(KNOCKING)

27:19.012 --> 27:22.607
Hanna? Honey? What's going on?

27:22.808 --> 27:25.311
Done. Can't do this
anymore, trace.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.942
You're clearly not
ready to have a child.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.160
Honey, I've been doing
so well lately.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.616
Yeah?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.668
I'm not.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.792
But Hanna, you kept the child. I
thought you wanted to make this work.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.421
I kept the baby because the
jerkoffs at the doctor's office

27:47.624 --> 27:48.967
were playing movie
"Juno" on a loop.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.465
You know what? I'm
sitting there,

27:50.669 --> 27:54.549
and it occurs to me that
I have options here.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.635
I can have this baby,
but I don't have to...

27:57.843 --> 28:01.814
I mean, I can do it...
I can do it without...

28:03.974 --> 28:05.851
Without me?

28:06.059 --> 28:07.481
Hanna?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.154
I can't believe that you
would even say that,

28:09.354 --> 28:10.651
or think that.

28:10.856 --> 28:14.076
It's not always
about you, trace.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.904
I haven't felt like
myself in months.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.581
Exactly'. Don't take this
hormone imbalance out on me'.!

28:19.781 --> 28:21.909
Do not patronize me like that.
It's not the hormones.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.664
- Okay.
- It's you.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.964
- Okay.
- I don't like how I feel around you.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.545
- Okay.
- This isn't me.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.219
This isn't me. This
isn't who I am.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.593
I'm not this negative person.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.515
I can't control how you feel.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.890
You know what, you do. And I
don't need that in my life.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.348
I never needed anyone in my
life, and I can do this alone.

28:45.474 --> 28:49.069
Like your mother?

28:49.269 --> 28:51.488
Do you think that she was
happy raising you on her own?

28:51.688 --> 28:54.157
She found her happiness.

28:54.358 --> 28:58.033
Maybe... maybe it took her
three husbands, but so what?

28:58.237 --> 29:01.332
- So what.
- Don't talk about my mother.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.750
Okay? My mother's
freakin' awesome.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.380
Okay.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.546
You want me gone? Fine.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.347
You don't need to get upset.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.890
Your grandmother's
an amazing woman.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.392
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

29:40.153 --> 29:41.405
Senor.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.662
Oh, hey, from the hotel.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.995
Yeah, well, not anymore.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.705
After the missus called

29:49.913 --> 29:51.290
they thought I did
something unseemly

29:51.498 --> 29:54.092
- and fire me.
- No.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.137
- It's okay.
- Oh.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.556
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.554
She's not herself right now.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.101
She's, you know, she's pregnant.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.430
She's got these hormones and...

30:05.637 --> 30:08.015
Oh, she's not herself.
I'm sorry.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.770
Maybe she's showing you
who she really is.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.020
Yeah, maybe.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.608
Let me show you what
you've been missing

30:17.816 --> 30:19.614
cooped up in that hotel room.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.697
'Hmm? 'I! Uh.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.952
I... I... I... I
probably shouldn't.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.960
As is I, I've never given
a big-time celebrity

30:32.164 --> 30:35.885
our special VIP tour.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.514
I wouldn't call it
big-time celebrity.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.061
I think so.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.074
Are you...

31:12.537 --> 31:14.881
Señora Mcevans, is
everything okay?

31:15.082 --> 31:16.675
Murder is illegal in
this country, right?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.718
Claro Que Si.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.638
- Yes.
- Okay, when the Police ask,

31:21.838 --> 31:22.930
you never saw me leave my room.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.303
- I saw nothing.
- Nothing.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.806
Nothing. Who are we gonna kill?

31:29.262 --> 31:31.105
- (SHOES SCREECH)
- Where can I buy a bat.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.934
- You guys have baseball here, right?
- Uh, no, Señora.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.769
- (SIGHS)
- uh, Señora.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.480
It is very dangerous for
you out here alone.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.903
Then come with me.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.533
We're gonna catch that son
of a bitch in the act

31:45.737 --> 31:47.205
and take him for every penny

31:47.406 --> 31:49.408
that one damn song pays him.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.915
Okay.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.963
I will help you.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.962
You're cutting off the
circulation in your hands.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.509
Do you mind? I'm just...

31:59.709 --> 32:01.757
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.244
Hi.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.995
Ah, whoo, can't do that.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.546
- I can't...
- Do what?

32:36.746 --> 32:40.125
Ah, ha-ha. I, uh, I...
I... I love my wife.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.135
And, um...

32:42.335 --> 32:44.554
If I don't consider her

32:44.754 --> 32:47.052
in all parts of my life,
I'm..., I'm-—, she's gone.

32:47.257 --> 32:50.306
And, um, yeah, and...
and this is, uh...

32:50.510 --> 32:51.932
(NERVOUS LAUGH)

32:52.137 --> 32:54.606
This is all kinds of
inconsiderate to her, so...

32:54.806 --> 32:57.480
I don't think she sees you
the way that I see you.

32:57.684 --> 33:02.941
When I look at you, I see
an a-list celebrity.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.695
Whoo. Yeah, well, you know,

33:04.900 --> 33:06.948
sadly the rest of the world

33:07.152 --> 33:08.324
doesn't see me that way.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.997
They all think I'm a
complete failure.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.825
- Failure?
- Yeah.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.831
But, you know, maybe that,
that's what good couples do.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.833
They, uh, they, they're
honest about their failures.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.292
You know, they're...

33:18.497 --> 33:19.623
They don't sugarcoat
their bowel movements,

33:19.831 --> 33:21.674
and, um, I shouldn't even,

33:21.875 --> 33:23.377
not even, uh, be here.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.097
- Yeah.
- You are here.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.299
Yeah, and, I, uh, I...
I should go.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.135
I know that it's... it's a...
It's a thrill, right,

33:31.343 --> 33:33.061
to be around a
big-time celebrity.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.808
But, uh, you got a lot
going for you, kid.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.517
You're... you're... you're...
Well, you are whip-smart,

33:38.683 --> 33:40.981
and you got, you
know, hypnotic eyes

33:41.186 --> 33:42.483
- and...
- yeah?

33:42.687 --> 33:45.406
Intoxicating skin and...
and you just...

33:45.607 --> 33:47.029
I can't, I can't, uh...

33:47.234 --> 33:49.202
Whoo! Can't do it.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.155
And, and I'm, I'm really
sorry about all this.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.537
- Me, too.
- What?

33:54.741 --> 33:56.914
(SCREAMING)

33:58.870 --> 34:00.417
You think we should dust
keep heading this way?

34:00.622 --> 34:03.125
Yes, Si. Cueva Del
Amor is this way.

34:03.333 --> 34:07.554
Uh, many people go there to, um,

34:07.754 --> 34:09.222
they can go there to hug.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.925
Yep. Got it.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.594
Oh, look.

34:14.803 --> 34:18.558
Got you now, you
cheating sou of a...

34:23.061 --> 34:24.984
- Okay, okay.
- Ahh.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

34:28.149 --> 34:29.947

of the hotel or...

No, no, no, no. (SPEAKS SPANISH)

to the site now.

Hey, hey, no, no, no Policia.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.793
Listen, I'll give
you Dinero, yeah?

34:39.995 --> 34:41.542
Dinero and no Policia.
Don't go to the Police.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.746
- Okay.
- Yeah?

34:42.956 --> 34:44.549
- Dinero, huh?
- And no Police.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.547
You think I'm afraid of the Police?
No, no, no, no.

34:46.751 --> 34:47.967
The Police are afraid of me.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.512
Huh.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.215
Oh, okay, yeah, hey. But
we can stop at an ATM,

34:51.422 --> 34:53.221
and I'll give you lots of money.

34:53.425 --> 34:58.352
ATM. We gonna take you to more
than one little ATM visit.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.274
Someone is going to pay
big money for you.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.978
Why? Hey, I'm a nobody.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.233
You think...

35:07.772 --> 35:09.240
You're, you're a no...

35:09.441 --> 35:11.944
You act like a big
somebody at the hotel.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.579
You talk to everybody like,
like you're a big shot.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.248
Yeah, yeah, I'm American.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.419
(CHUCKLES) almost, pretty boy.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.292

35:31.755 --> 35:34.383
They'll keep moving him and
marching him around the jungle.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.389
If we lose them,

35:36.593 --> 35:38.595
we'll never be able to find him.

What do you mean, never
be able to find them?

35:42.349 --> 35:44.602
- Follow me.
- But...

35:44.809 --> 35:48.109
But they have jeeps, vehicles.

is stay close enough

another way down.

go to the Police.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.594

Why don't we just go to the Police
station or office or something?

38:46.241 --> 38:48.494
Well, it doesn't
really work like that.

troops will not catch them.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.552
So what can we do?

46:40.756 --> 46:41.803
There's nothing we can do.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.305
We have to wait for their offer.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.261
No, you don't understand.
This is trace.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.312
He doesn't even know
how to dress himself.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.766
Look, your son said that... that
maybe if we stay on their trail

46:49.974 --> 46:51.817
that there's a good chance
that we could find them.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.270
Yeah, we got to
get the bad guys.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.319
It's... it's...

46:54.478 --> 46:55.650
It sounds like trying to,

46:55.855 --> 46:57.949
to catch a chicken
with garden wire.

46:58.149 --> 46:59.025
(DISTANT THUNDER)

46:59.233 --> 47:00.485
It is difficult to do.

47:00.693 --> 47:01.615
Look,

47:01.819 --> 47:02.820
I know that I can...

47:03.029 --> 47:04.281
I can do this on my own, okay?

47:04.488 --> 47:05.705
But...

47:05.906 --> 47:07.374
I'd really rather
not have his father

47:07.575 --> 47:10.203
cut up into a million
pieces all over the Amazon.

47:15.624 --> 47:16.921
Fine. Okay.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.299
Make sure that the fort
is locked down tight,

47:19.503 --> 47:22.256
and get all calls
to me on the radio.

47:22.465 --> 47:25.344
We've have endured the
abuse for way too long.

47:25.551 --> 47:26.643
You take our roses,

47:26.844 --> 47:28.312
you take our bananas...

47:28.512 --> 47:30.310
- You have oil spills...
- Yes, the senator

47:30.514 --> 47:32.061
will be at the bush
family ART gallery,

47:32.266 --> 47:34.143
opening on the i8th.
Okay, thank you so much,

47:34.352 --> 47:35.979
we'll see you there.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.985
- Shannon.
- Oh, great. Yes, thank you so much.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.658
The senator will absolutely be at
the Koch brothers family picnic.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.576
- Shannon.
- Yes, we are so looking forward to it, okay.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.074
Shannon. Shannon!

47:44.278 --> 47:45.404
We will see you there,
thank you so much.

47:45.613 --> 47:46.830
- Shannon!
- Mm?

47:47.031 --> 47:49.079
Why do I care about this again?

47:49.283 --> 47:50.660
Uh, because it was on the web

47:50.868 --> 47:52.666
and a link was also
sent directly to you

47:52.870 --> 47:54.793
- from a server in Cartegentina.
- So what?

47:54.997 --> 47:56.214
Yes, I'm Cartegentinean,

47:56.415 --> 47:57.416
but that does not make
me a senator there.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.093
No, I know.

47:59.293 --> 48:02.172
They also have, um, trace
Mcevans as a hostage.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.883
So that's exciting. You
could sign right here.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.013
It's for the elephants.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.594
Should I know who that is?

48:07.802 --> 48:09.554
I mean, it sounds
familiar, but...

48:09.762 --> 48:11.389
Is he important?

48:11.597 --> 48:13.099
You would have to
define "important."

48:13.307 --> 48:15.651
So every two seconds an
elephant is brutally murdered.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.603
Look, Shannon. I am
an important person,

48:17.812 --> 48:19.906
my friends are important people.

48:20.106 --> 48:21.358
There goes one.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.112
Maybe Bieber knows him.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.036
I'm going to tweet
him a pm, yes.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.490
All right, we'll just let
these elephants die.

real publicity boost.

- oh! Hey!

49:23.461 --> 49:24.633
Why?

49:24.837 --> 49:27.966
Because you can help
unload the Jeep.

49:28.174 --> 49:31.644
And we know this jungle
like the back of our hand.

worse what we can.

through the jungle to the north.

You slow us down, you're dead.

by the government?

49:54.074 --> 49:55.667

- Boil it.
- Yeah.

boil the water, let it cool,

54:33.437 --> 54:34.734
Who taught him how to text?

54:34.938 --> 54:37.236
I mean, let's be honest.
If I was vice president,

54:37.441 --> 54:39.489
we'd get some stuff done
around here, right?

54:39.693 --> 54:41.912
We'd make it way better for
all the ladies out there.

54:42.112 --> 54:44.240
You feel me, girl.

54:44.448 --> 54:47.497
- You got senator Lopez...
- Hey, nobody calls me Biebs!

54:47.701 --> 54:48.918
- Except you, girl.
- All right guys, come on.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.496
That's enough, that's enough.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.923
So Justin continued to
share on his social media.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.750
"Look, this guy is
sending me tweets

56:42.733 --> 56:46.533
is that you've never met somebody as
completely self-destructive as I am.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.159
Shit, forget surviving
in the jungle,

56:48.363 --> 56:50.115
I can barely survive
in a Westside Condo,

56:50.324 --> 56:51.701
eating frozen gluten-free pizza

56:51.909 --> 56:53.035
and drinking grass-fed
milk, okay?

56:53.243 --> 56:55.416
Which I forget to buy
most of the time.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.248
All right? Without someone
to literally buy it for me,

56:57.456 --> 56:59.003
I would die.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.426
What business do I have bringing
a child into this world?

57:01.627 --> 57:04.096
I'm not even a fully
functional human being.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.941
What is gluten-free?

57:20.103 --> 57:20.945
Huh?

57:21.146 --> 57:22.614
Juan, that's enough.

57:22.814 --> 57:25.533
What? It... it...

57:25.734 --> 57:27.452
Did everyone go to
the farmer's market

57:27.653 --> 57:29.621
- without me and my...
- It's in the trees.

57:29.821 --> 57:31.619
Here.

57:31.782 --> 57:33.250
Am I this unthreatening?

57:33.450 --> 57:35.327
Am I... am I this
unthreatening to you guys

57:35.535 --> 57:37.629
that you just... you don't
care that I have a knife?

57:37.829 --> 57:38.580
Yesenia?

57:38.789 --> 57:39.915
Yes, Juan.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.466
He's quick.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.795
Ah, Yesenia.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.471
- Yes, Juan.
- Not so quick.

57:46.672 --> 57:47.639

58:04.189 --> 58:07.659
- Hola.
- Hola... again.

58:07.859 --> 58:10.863
Okay, great. So we're
all back in the car.

58:11.071 --> 58:12.368
All right, so I got...
I've had some time

58:12.572 --> 58:14.540
to think about a little
plan of action here.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.664
And I think I've come
up with something so...

58:16.827 --> 58:18.829
If we can just calculate
the miles per hour

58:19.037 --> 58:20.163
that they are
ostensibly traveling,

58:20.372 --> 58:23.000
then we can come up
with a radius here.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.960
We have a plan and
so it's just...

58:25.168 --> 58:26.590
Traffic.

58:26.795 --> 58:28.672
"0, no, no, no!

58:28.880 --> 58:31.178
Seriously, come on.

58:31.383 --> 58:35.308
Look. I was under the impression
that you were trying to help me.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.731
I will help you on
my terms, okay?

58:37.931 --> 58:39.729
In my way.

58:39.933 --> 58:40.980
You are not the only
person in the planet.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.527
Okay, but it just seems like

58:42.728 --> 58:44.230
maybe if we come up with
some sort of plan here,

58:44.438 --> 58:46.566
like, that involved actually
looking for my husband,

58:46.773 --> 58:48.366
rather than picking up small
children on the side of the street,

58:48.525 --> 58:50.368
then maybe we'll
actually find him!

58:50.569 --> 58:52.162
Have belief.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.490
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

58:54.698 --> 58:57.577
- Comprende?
- Si.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.752
Well, other than the kidnapping,

58:59.953 --> 59:01.170
how do you like my country?

59:03.540 --> 59:06.168
Are you serious?

59:06.376 --> 59:08.344
When this is all over,
you should come back.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.388
Yeah? Oh, we will. I'm sure.

59:10.589 --> 59:12.432
- We have the beautiful beaches,
- we'll book our next trip,

59:12.632 --> 59:14.509
- we have...
- Right? Right away.

59:14.718 --> 59:17.767

gets in the way,

59:17.971 --> 59:19.769
- one to the head.
- Yes, sir.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.816
We'll retrieve the hostage,
no matter what it takes, sir.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.644
Yes, yes. Get the guy.

59:23.852 --> 59:25.695
But...

59:25.896 --> 59:27.648
- On the DL.
- Sir?

59:27.856 --> 59:29.858
Just do it, but on the...
On the down low.

Props.

59:43.330 --> 59:46.459
Not that anyone should be proud
of taking a human life, sir.

59:46.666 --> 59:47.963
- No.
- And those are...

59:48.168 --> 59:49.761
Classified operations.

59:49.961 --> 59:50.928
That's what I'm talking about.

59:53.173 --> 59:54.891
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, homie.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.389
Keep me posted on Skype.

The devil?

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.427

something very powerful

kindness in your heart,

and for that they would
like to help you.

better to have i00 eyes,

people to rally them?

do it by myself.

we think we are.

speak of, yeah,

We are the best at nice.
Wait and see.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.068
WOMAN: The tracker says
they're right here.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:53.278
- That's them!
- (SIRENS)

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.493
We got these bitches.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.845
Attention, poachers.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:16.767
Authorities are en route.

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:19.812
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.890
Oh, that was record timing.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.895
Poachers!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.524
We are representatives
of Greenpeas.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.606
We mean you no harm.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:32.908
Back's empty.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.702
(GROANS) so is the bottom.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.496
And I'm not seeing any
sign of the gator.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.620
Where is the gator, sir?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.952
I don't know, maybe the SW amp,
you can find it in a swamp.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.288
You already turn him into a handbag, huh?
Huh, you piece of shit?

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.464
There have to be more of you.
Where are they?

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.712
Where are your amigos?

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:54.263
I'm just here all by myself.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.434
- Can you pop the hood?
- Pop the hood!

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.011
So help me, we will lay in
front of this car so fast.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.640
You're gonna see how
Greenpeas does it.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.099
You're about to get peas'd, son.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.651
- I'll go.
- Okay, right here.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.694
Wait, what if he
goes into reverse?

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.196
Do you think you were
gonna reverse, bitch? Ha!

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.653
Nice.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.453
We think of everything!

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.256
Whew!

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.957
This was a good idea.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.759
Who thought of this?

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:35.680
A good leader can
recognize a good idea.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.096
- Yesenia?
- Yes, Juan.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.974
This your idea.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.225
It was a good one.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.524
Vamos.

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.317
- (SIGHS)
- let's go, guys.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.397
We carry it around the rocks to
the other side of the river.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.151
Was that so hard?

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.983
Fearless leader, huh?

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.534
Maybe my ideas are not so bad?

01:09:56.734 --> 01:10:00.659
Okay, okay, you're a
good insurgent member.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.331
Thank you.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.330
Now, what do you think
about my plan B

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.002
for the Gringo now, huh?

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.579
Uh, your call.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.755
It just makes sense.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.880
Poor Gringo baby.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.711
I know, baby grande.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.637
Trace?

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:23.095
Yeah? Gringo baby daddy here.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.895
Concerned about his future.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.723
You know, we are not
here to hurt you.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:30.401
That's great news. How
do we keep it that way?

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.729
Ransoms can take months
before they get to us.

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.814
Whoa, months?

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:39.528
The money doesn't go to us.
Money goes to the revolution.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.534
- La Revolucion!
- Revolution?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:44.912
As a compromise to get
you back to your family,

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.494
we want to take you to see
some of the evidence.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.127
Mass graves, chemical
weapons, illegal trafficking,

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.173
real first world shit.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.717
No kidding. Congratulations.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.511
That's pretty good for
such a tiny country.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:01.933
These are some of the atrocities
our government is guilty of.

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:05.353
We want you to go back to the
American people on television

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.180
and tell them about us.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.641
Getting on TV to say
something important,

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:11.772
that's, like, even
harder than what I do.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.195
If you can promise this, we will
take you north to the border

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:18.025
and free you to our neighboring
country's embassy in just a few days.

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:20.485
Easy.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.320
I can try.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.496
No, I need you to swear it.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.165
Okay, I swear.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:29.118
- Yesenia?
- Yes, Juan?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.003
That sounds like a weak promise.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.252
Cartegentina jungle
survival tip number three,

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:37.962
never break a promise.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:41.924
I swear to show the atrocities.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.634
- Okay, okay.
- Yesenia?

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.219
Yes, Juan?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.648
I don't know about
this idea anymore.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.395
Si.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.107
Let it be, please.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.439
Let's... we're gonna play it out

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.024
play out. What is play out?

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.108
- Just go...
- What is play out?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.239
Are you with me?

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:03.615
- No.
- No?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.163
- I'm not with you.
- Are you serious?

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.331
- I'm not with you.
- Surprise, surprise.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:08.909
Okay, Vamanos! Back in the boat.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.707
Atras, atras, back, back.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.633
Go a little slower then??
Faster.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.713
Then??, faster, slower.

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:33.817
So, guys, are you going to
give me a ticket or something?

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:38.692
A ticket? For the Nefarious
murder of a Caiman Crocodilus?

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.194
Who's the cold-blooded one now?

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.821
Heh, heh, nice.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.528
Get it, cold-blooded?

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.113
(GUNSHOTS)

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.909
Stop, don't move.

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:57.586
Watch it man! Those are very
endangered arrow carrier trees.

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:01.803
If you're trying to
shoot him, here.

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:03.676
What? Girls can't shoot
where you're from?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.224
- Boom! Who's the Tranq Queen?
- Don't move, don't.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.301
She's a good shot
with a tranquilizer.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.557
Yeah, well I meant to Miss him so
he'd lead us back to his camp.

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.264
Looking for this gentleman,
have you seen him?

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:17.102
You're looking for
Ryan Seacrest?

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.653
Is that a yes or a no?

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:23.529
We haven't really seen
humans, in a while.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.452
You know, especially tall,
sexy, handsome ones.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:30.327
So yeah, no, we
haven't seen him.

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:33.000
Well if you do, there's
a significant reward

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.918
for anyone helping to
obtain the subject.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:36.792
As in money?

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.048
For like, whatever we want?

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.751
Typically that's how it works.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.176
We don't give out gift cards.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.254
What about you? What
do you give out?

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.259
Do you want your phone?

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.091
Nice to meet you.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.224
Boop.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.430
(SNORING)

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.636
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.270
You should have listened to me.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.067
You, I told you
to paddle faster.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:48.947
You, I said slower.
Pero Nunca Me Escuchas.

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:52.663
I told you to look
out for that branch.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:55.662
Hey, you okay?

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.664
Si, mama.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.795
I'll just take a nap.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:02.875
Oh, no, nope, nope.
Sit up, okay.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.296
You could have run away.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.428
You're a good mama.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.805
Yeah, I don't know how to be much
more than a good looking guy,

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.638
but I did take an extensive first aid class
when I found out Hannah was pregnant

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:21.226
and it suggests you stay active and
alert when you get a concussion.

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:23.812
- There you go.
- Mama, you make the best spaghetti.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.272
Oh, geez.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:29.992
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:33.321
My god, you guys are
making me lose my shit.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.875
Bueno, bueno, bueno. Tell
your Madri'e I say hello.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.257
Did they find him?

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.084
I think the jungle
may have found him.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.354
That's him?

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.057
One Gringo marching with
a group of armed rebels?

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.227
Yes, I would say that is him.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.187
Who the heck is that?

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:10.858
That could be trouble.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.946
And there's no way to get around
the mountain before they do.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:15.951
Well, I mean, is there
another way down?

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:20.959
Come, come, come.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.421
Follow where the yellow crested
blackbirds are flying away from.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.093
Got it.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:40.267
Come on, guys, we've
all made mistakes.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:46.064
I mean, I've made mistakes.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.862
My wife, she wants
to divorce me.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.613
You've gotta do something
to make it better.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.945
Like move ahead and
make amends, right?

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:59.032
You sound exactly like
our current government.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.995
Saying all these things, excuses,
promises that don't mean anything

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:07.708
because you're not giving us the one
thing we need to make us happy.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.752
No more political murders?

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.088
Oh please, the
country has those.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.639
I'm talking about choice.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.094
You know, you can't control her to
do exactly what you want her to do.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.931
Control her? Please, it's
not like I'm holding a gun

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.607
to her head and
being a dictator.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:27.560
Yeah, Presidente Apendejo
definitely said that.

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:31.648
You know, your head, you're
so far into the future.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:34.780
Worrying, worrying about
your place inside that...

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.157
You've never been present
enough for her to be heard.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:40.114
- Oh, she just can't ignore...
- Let alone make a decision on her own.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.541
- The wicked barbarity of the past.
- But that's the point.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:46.791
Give her the choice
in the present.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:49.298
And then, I don't know,
maybe support her?

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.923
At least she made the choice.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:58.805
And usually, however... however
begrudgingly, we have to rationalize

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.978
and, you know, even
if the situation

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:05.523
is clearly worse.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.817
Clearly, worse.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:13.023
At least we are happier to have had
the freedom to make the choice.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.234
Isn't that what we're
fighting for here?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.323
Isn't it?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:22.157
It's not about promises
for the future,

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.241
it's about working
hard in the present

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.044
to make the future that we want.

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:29.167
That's worth all this.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:35.049
All this, come Se dice... shit!

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:36.629
Exact o.

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.932
I guess that's the first step.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.009
Vamos.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.720
No, just...

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.575
Even I am afraid of this one.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.248
I don't know who
maintains it anymore.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.538
Dammit, what kind of
Babymoon is this?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.499
I mean, all I wanted was
one of those nice relaxing

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:15.300
couples' beach massages

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.380
with those cute little... Those
stones, those hot stones,

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.884
and then those cup
things that leave

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.012
those really horrible
marks on your back.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:24.890
Is that too much to ask for?

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.721
Your call.

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:27.976
Thanks.

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:29.936
Like this is gonna save my life.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:35.605
I can't do this. Let's
just call for back up.

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:36.905
Diago.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:40.986
Hey papa, did we get those guys?

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:42.490
No, no, not yet.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.242
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.322
Diago. (CRACKLING)

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.034
Wow, he sure loves justice.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:54.461
Yes. His mother was killed
in criminal violence.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.632
As proud as I am of the
man he's becoming,

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.215
as tough as I am,

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:03.800
the loss of a
parent is a sadness

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.056
that I cannot replace.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.642
Diago?

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:12.225
Oy, Diago?

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:15.061
Diago?

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:16.646
We need to move to the other
side of the mountain.

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:18.777
HANNA: Let's do this.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.858
(SCREAMS)

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.080
Oh, my god!

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.914
(SCREAMING)

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.045
(SCREAMING)

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.680
(SIRENS)

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:48.101
Mira.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:49.645
They found us.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.313
Into the jungle!

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:52.810
Spread out! You, stay here.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.392
Who is it?

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.486
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.030
This could jeopardize
the entire movement.

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.528
Señora, kill the Gringo.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:19.792
Stop.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.502
- Trace.
- Han Na, stay back.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:22.962
- Stay back.
- I brought help.

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:26.094
- Baby.
- You brought the government?

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.346
Yes, you're surrounded.
Let him go.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.473
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:34.932
- Don't do this.
- Hey, hey we had a promise, remember?

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.643
Rule number three, you
never break that.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.979
They're going to take
you away, trace.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.905
No one will know
what happened here.

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:45.110
Maybe like this, someone
will come and investigate.

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:47.035
You're right, you're right.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:48.408
Okay, this can be
solved with my death,

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:52.492
or... or it can be
solved with your choice.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.451
Remember your choice?

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.037
Yeah, you've got a choice
right now, you can choose.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.371
You don't, I will.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:58.751
- Whoa.
- All of you.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.459
- Hey, hey.
- All of you.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.343
- Juan!
- Yesenia.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:05.012
- Juan - Yesenia.

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:06.338
- Juan - Yesenia.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:10.518
All the guns are pointed at me!

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:14.722
Okay, okay.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.810
- Told you, son, we know every leaf of this jungle.
- So we got it, right?

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:20.940
- The reward money for finding him?
- Don't have him yet.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.397
They don't call me
the Tranq queen

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:24.982
because of my raging
barbiturates problem.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.113
(GUNSHOT)

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.807
Hey! Hey!

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:54.308
Yesenia, just run.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:55.854
Vete!

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.311
Help! My wife has been shot!

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.277
Dammit! I never Miss.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.483
I meant to shoot
her in the chest.

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:09.318
- Que?
- Whoa!

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.449
Have a Bowl of Quinoa
and chill out, dude.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.030
It's just a tranquilizer.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:15.661
It's a 100% organic tranquilizer.
You're good.

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:19.871
Whoa, I'm dizzy, but I'm okay.
I'm okay.

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.256
Embrace it, all right? You'll
have a really nice nap.

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:25.300
You'll be a awake
in, like, two days?

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:26.423
Two days, tops.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.675
No, these are not for humans.

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:32.099
At her body weight and condition, the
lowered heart rate can kill them both.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.142
Both? He's okay.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.811
They usually don't kill.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.854
Most people.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:40.057
She's pregnant.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.563
Oh, come on!

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:45.237
Yes, sir, we have visual.
Extraction is imminent.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:46.689
Hey! Hey!

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.571
Trace, that is a U.S.
Special Forces MH6.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:52.153
They're not going to help. They're
orders are going to be to take you

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:53.578
across the border
to the consulate.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.157
That may be too
much time for her.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.289
Hey, listen, listen,
the best thing to do

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.542
is to get her to the village
down the road to stabilize her.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.498
I know exactly where
the doctor is.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.175
Okay, okay, Hanna, baby.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.548
- Honey, did you hear that?
- Hi.

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:10.049
- Hey. Hey baby.
- Hi.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.473
What do you want to do?

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:14.346
You've got the choice, okay?

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.018
I'll stay with them.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.220
Stay with them? Okay,
you stay with them.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:21.061
We'll stay, we'll stay.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:24.610
Uh, actually there's a reward,
so we're gonna have to...

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:34.033
No, they're right. If you stay with
us they're going to hunt us down.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.124
Go with them. Go with them.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:42.874
Okay, I'll go, okay?

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.671
Hanna, honey, you're
going to be okay.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.293
- Okay.
- You're gonna be okay by yourself.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.375
You're always okay by yourself.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:54.307
But I need... The village...
people.

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:56.554
Okay, baby, I know
what you mean.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.351
I'll be your macho man, okay?

01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:03.149
All right, okay, everybody,
everybody hide. All right?

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.066
Thank you.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.486
Hey, trace, rule number three.

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:15.577
Hey!

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.143
Trace?

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.395
No.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:48.102
Am I dead?

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:52.156
No, you'll be fantastic.

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.825
Both of you.

01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:56.823
Good.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:00.577
He's not going to be some sort
of adrenaline junkie now, is he?

01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:02.033
(LAUGHING)

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.335
Good joke. Strong.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:10.132
You see, Señora, never be afraid
to believe in good people.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.714
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.351
America will be
happy to see you.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:23.474
America?

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.523
President back home, I've set up a
press conference at the embassy.

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:32.566
Great, Shannon,

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.148
I'm going to want you to
get every media outlet

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.482
we can get to be there at
this press conference.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.695
- Congratulations.
- oh, thank you.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:41.496
You know, see, I've been
polling kind of cold, lately.

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:43.916
- And this is the..
- Senator Lopez. Fantastic.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:47.666
You're looking good. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.792
Kind of cold and this is
going to be that one moment

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:54.297
I need to push us toward the
vice presidency slot next year.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.219
- Great. I'm on it. I'm on it.
- I know you are.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.218
Maybe you can pay me one day.

01:26:58.422 --> 01:27:00.891
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:13.938
Any word from trace?

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:16.069
Uh, he made it to the consulate.

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:18.822
It will take him some
time to clear it all up

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:23.121
with the Burocracia,
but go, get some rest.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:25.665
Tomorrow I will come and
take you to the airport

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.334
back to him.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:32.631
Well, this has been
quite an adventure.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.050
Thank you.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.932
Bienvenida, Señora Mcevans.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:48.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.354
Just so you know, I said
nothing to the Police.

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:54.186
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.817
I have a little surprise
for you, right this way.

01:27:59.649 --> 01:28:01.868
(RINGING)

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.548
She's not picking up.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.468
Get through this.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:21.046
Make a little speech.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:23.473
I'll fly you back
in country myself.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:40.320
Okay. Has someone
already styled you?

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:43.778
The hair, the tattered
clothes, you look fantastic.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.204
Uh, thanks?

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:51.001
So, let's get to the nitty gritty and review
what you're going to say to the press.

01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:55.798
Okay, well, I was supposed to tell the
world about the government atrocities,

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.965
but I never got a
chance to see them.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:02.171
Well, we'll just embellish the fear
you felt during the abduction.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:04.177
We want some real drama
before we get to the part

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.679
when you shake hands with the
congressman and then, boom'.!

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:09.386
State your confidence in the
current political regime.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:16.192
I don't think that I'm in a
position to talk about these issues

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:19.818
much less issue a statement of
support for the current government.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:25.198
Trace, the whole world is
focused on you right now.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.909
I don't have to tell
you how rare that is

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.582
or how important
your words will be.

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.085
You're gonna be great.

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:44.301
Please accept a complimentary
couples' spa treatment.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:48.634
Wow, I'm not saying that I
don't need this, but why?

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:54.019
I believe a guest of ours requested it
as an apology for a dinner gone wrong.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:59.695
Oh, yeah. That was really nice
of him, but it's just me.

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:02.774
Even more of a
reason, girlfriend.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.198
- Okay.
- Enjoy.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.197
Thank you.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:16.462
Is there anyone else you want
to call while we're waiting?

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:20.882
No, I don't know
anyone's numbers.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.676
The only reason I know my wife's number
is because she made me memorize it.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:28.132
You know, I just got kidnapped.

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:39.234
Uh, yeah, actually. I've got...
thanks.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:57.578
I know, people have asked me,
"am I running? Am I going?"

01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:00.130
I can't really answer that today
because that's not why we're here.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.630
We are not here for ray Lopez,
possible vice presidential candidate.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.419
That's not why we are here.

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:10.929
The world brings its full
attention to cartegentina.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:15.729
And as a Cartegentinan-American,
I am proud to bridge the gap

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:18.773
between our two administrations,

01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:23.605
and here on U.S. Embassy
soil please welcome home

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:28.739
my fellow countryman,
William trace Mcevans.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.288
Where did this guy go?

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:42.588
Hello, everyone, hello.

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.837
I am producer fabrice Mancini.

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:46.918
Perhaps some of you...

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:52.805
Evidently not, I'm gonna be the
spokesman for trace Mcevans today.

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:58.014
Trace is taking some time privately
to prepare himself to meet the public

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:00.724
and discuss his
incredible ordeal.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:04.732
I'm also here this morning to
announce Avery special new project

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.813
that we're working on together.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:12.654
I have arranged a V.I.P. Tour
with the Cartegentian rebels.

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:16.161
They will take my documentary
film crew further into the jungle

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.243
than any crew, any crew,
has ever gone before.

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:22.876
And we will hear for the first
time, from the rebels themselves.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:26.834
And as it turns out,
every once in a while

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.386
there are some things

01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:31.839
that are worth fighting for.

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:34.391
Any questions?

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.142
Is everything okay?

01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:45.397
It's beautiful.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.779
It's just not perfect.

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:58.282
Trace?

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.242
No Ma'am, I'm just taking over.

01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:07.548
Oh!

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.300
Took you long enough.

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:14.848
Why am I not surprised?

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:17.801
I certainly wasn't going to let you
experience this all by yourself.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:21.684
If you allow me to
join you, of course.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:26.901
What, for the massage,

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:30.606
or the pushing another human
being out of my body?

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:34.113
Both.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.348
Thank you for making
this perfect.

01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:14.817
TRACE: Best vacation
I've ever had, I'd say.

01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:17.994
HANNA: So much so, that we
decided to make it a tradition

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:18.990
and come back for number two.

01:34:19.195 --> 01:34:20.037
Yeah, why not every year.

01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:22.832
Very French.

01:34:23.032 --> 01:34:26.002
My gosh, sounds like you might not have
stayed together if you hadn't gotten away.

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:30.207
Getting away really gave
us some perspective.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:33.134
It's true.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:37.430
That's how that Oscar-nominated
documentary got made, right?

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:40.634
Oh yeah, did for that old government
what blackfish did for sea world.

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:44.437
And it gave fabrice Mancini his
first film of credibility.

01:34:44.637 --> 01:34:47.811
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Oh, papa's getting a call.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:51.486
- Hi.
- Come on, trace. Hook a brother up.

01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:53.484
Get me some good press.

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.484
You're my press secretary.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.987
On vacation.

01:34:57.192 --> 01:35:00.321
I got you out of the goddamn jungle.
Remember that, okay?

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.246
- All right.
- Trace, I was just kidding.

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.373
Okay? Kidding, kidding.
Come on, man.

01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:06.372
Okay, I'll do my best.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:11.002
I have to go now and spend
time with my family.

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:12.458
Oh, that boy!

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:14.133
Okay. Bye.

01:35:14.334 --> 01:35:15.460
What does he want?

01:35:15.668 --> 01:35:19.718
To be Mardi Gras Grand Marshall?

01:35:19.923 --> 01:35:21.220
Pretty close, actually.

01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:29.562
These old folks make up
the craziest stories.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:39.692
Madame senator.

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.574
For your visit.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.576
Madame senator.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:47.080
Enough with the senator stuff,
I'm just ahead in the polls

01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:51.459
in what looks to be a fair
election, so a good first start.

01:35:51.663 --> 01:35:53.336
Hi, papa.

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:56.843
One bit of business beforehand,

01:35:57.043 --> 01:35:59.967
congressman Lopez, he wants to stand
next to you at the swearing in ceremony.

01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:03.471
The guy, he's a bit of a ham,
but he likes the publicity,

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.348
what do you think?

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:08.600
Only on the grounds that
he support my initiatives

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:12.400
and I get a kiss from
that baby inside.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.728
Deal.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:19.282
- Baby grande, you look good.
- Thank you.

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:22.736
- Madame senator?
- Yes, deputy Juan?

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:26.118
This is the cutest
baby I have ever seen.

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:33.713
- Madame senator?
- Yes, Juan?

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:39.761
This is still the cutest
baby I have ever seen.

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:43.506
Si, yo Se.

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:49.934
Hey, have fun with
your adventures, guys.

after you're done with
all this gun stuff.

01:37:08.197 --> 01:37:10.199
Long trip, sailor.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:15.922
So is that a no or a...?

01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:17.214
- King of the Holes.

01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:19.008
Good one, baby.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:21.169
You know what, I'm going to make
you my head of development,

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:24.426

This is not what they have
in those "sunset" magazines

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:35.104
with the big island men
that rub coconut oil

01:37:35.308 --> 01:37:38.983
all over your back and is
that too much to ask for?

01:37:39.187 --> 01:37:40.609
Is it?

01:37:43.649 --> 01:37:44.992
Yes.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:51.829

barely survive in a Westside condo

No, but you don't want
to be on the first floor

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:22.030
because the children make noise and
they throw stones at the windows.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:25.575
If you're on the third floor you will
not hear the stones on the windows

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:28.403
because they can't
throw that high.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:33.208
Massage chair or mass...
Because I think in the...

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.207
- There's a spa package.
- Yes.

01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:39.085
- Masseuse coming to the room.
- There was an asterisk.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:43.252
And if you go the bottom of the page it
says "please sit in the massage chair

01:38:43.459 --> 01:38:45.461
before you come to a masseuse

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:49.300
