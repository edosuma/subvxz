-I made you what you are.

-The Silence.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.159
The Silence is not a species.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.439
It is a religious order or movement.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.799
Their core belief is that silence
will fall when the question is asked.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.119
What question?

00:42.200 --> 00:45.679
The first question.
The oldest question in the universe.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.319
Hidden in plain sight.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.359
Yes, but what is the question?

And can you tell us anything about it?

01:41.520 --> 01:42.519
Well, all I can say now

01:42.600 --> 01:46.679
is that it involves ghosts in the past
and the present and the future,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.679
What time do you have, Doctor?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.959
Two minutes past five, Caesar.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.759
It's always two minutes past five.
Day or night,

02:20.120 --> 02:23.479
it's always two minutes past five
in the afternoon.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.359
Why is that?

02:25.440 --> 02:28.079
-Because that is the time, Caesar.
-And the date.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.239
It's always the 22nd of April.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.919
Does it not bother you?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.519
The date and the time
have always been the same, Caesar.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.559
Why should it start bothering me now?

02:38.640 --> 02:40.639

who knew a secret,

12:23.440 --> 12:27.999

How would you erase that secret
from the world,

before it can be spoken?

If I had to,

13:56.760 --> 13:58.879
Makes it easier to create a fixed point.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.359
And your death is a fixed point, Doctor.
You can't run away from this.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.799
What's the point in delaying?
How long have you delayed already?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.439
Been knocking about,
bit of a farewell tour.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.599
Things to do. People to see.
There's always more.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.799
I can invent a new colour.
Save the dodo. Join the Beatles.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.359
Hello! It's me. Get him. Tell him
we're going out and it's all on me

14:21.440 --> 14:24.639
except for the money and the driving.
I have got a time machine,

14:24.720 --> 14:27.039
Dorium, it's all still going on.
For me, it never stops.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.919
Liz I is still waiting in a glade
to elope with me.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.599
I could help Rose Tyler
with her homework.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.839
I could go on allJack's stag parties
in one night...

14:33.920 --> 14:35.879
Time catches up with us all, Doctor.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.759
Well, it has never laid a glove on me!

14:40.440 --> 14:42.519
-Hello?
-Doctor, I'm so sorry.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.599
We didn't know how to contact you.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.959
I'm afraid Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart
passed away.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.879
A few months ago.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.759
-Doctor?
-(STUTTERS) Yeah...

14:53.840 --> 14:56.119
-Yes, yes, er...
-It was very peaceful.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.519
He talked a lot about you,
if that's any comfort.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.479
Always made us pour an extra brandy

15:00.560 --> 15:02.759
in case you came round
one of these days.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.919
Doctor, what's wrong?

15:07.280 --> 15:08.519
Nothing, I...

15:09.200 --> 15:10.399
just...

15:26.800 --> 15:34.519
It's time.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.279
Surely you could deliver the messages
yourself?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.719
It would involve crossing
my own time stream.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.359
Best not.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.799
According to our files,
this is the end for you.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.159
Your finaljourney.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.279
We'll deliver your messages.
You can depend on us.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.599
Thank you.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.559
Doctor?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.519
Whatever you think of the Tesselecta,

16:08.600 --> 16:12.039
we are champions of law and order,
just as you've always been.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.119
Is there nothing else we can do?

16:20.120 --> 16:21.999
CHURCHILL: Why would you do this?

16:22.080 --> 16:25.199
Of all the things you've told me,
this I find hardest to believe.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.199
Why would you invite your friends
to see your death?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.519
If I had to die,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.119
I didn't have to die alone.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.999
-Doctor!
-(LAUGHING) It's the Pond!

16:36.120 --> 16:40.359
DOCTOR: Amy and Rory. The Last Centurion
and the girl who waited.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.679
However dark it got,
I'd turn around and there they'd be.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.439
If it's time to go,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.959
remember what you're leaving.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.119
Remember the best.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.279
My friends have always been
the best of me.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.239
And did you tell them
this was going to happen?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.039
It would help if you didn't keep
asking questions.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.159
(WHISPERING) We don't have much time.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.239
(GUNSHOT FIRING)

17:09.080 --> 17:10.879
CHURCHILL: And this woman you spoke of,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.079
did you invite her?

17:12.560 --> 17:13.759
Hello, sweetie.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.639
DOCTOR: Yes, she was there.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.159
River Song came twice.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.559
Napoleon gave me this bottle.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.759
Well, I mean, I said "gave". Threw.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.079
Salut!

17:27.160 --> 17:28.559
ALL: Salut!

17:28.920 --> 17:31.319
So, when are we going to 1 969?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.039
DOCTOR: Everything was in place.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.399
I only had to do one more thing.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.519
I only had to die.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.999
Oh, my God!

17:40.720 --> 17:42.639
You all need to stay back.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.519
Whatever happens now,
you do not interfere.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.319
RORY: That's an astronaut.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.799
-That's an Apollo astronaut in the lake.
-Look...

18:07.560 --> 18:08.999
Well, then.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.639
Here we are at last.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.319
I can't stop it. The suit's in control.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.199
You're not supposed to.
This has to happen.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.119
-Run!
-I did run.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.679
-Running brought me here
-I tried to fight it, but I can't.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.639
-It's too strong.
-I know.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.999
It's okay.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.919
This is where I die.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.759
This is a fixed point. This must happen.
This always happens.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.679
Don't worry.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.359
You won't even remember this.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.799
Look over there.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.919
It's me.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.199
How can I be there?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.359
That's you from the future,

18:51.800 --> 18:55.239
serving time for a murder
you probably can't remember.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.799
-My murder.
-Why would you do that?

18:59.800 --> 19:02.719
-Make me watch?
-So that you know this is inevitable.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.199
And you are forgiven.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.679
Always and completely forgiven.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.839
Please, my love.
Please, please, just run.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.559
-Can't.
-Time can be rewritten.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.319
Don't you dare.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.959
Goodbye, River.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.559
(RIVER GRUNTING)

19:36.680 --> 19:38.239
Hello, sweetie.

19:38.680 --> 19:39.959
What have you done?

19:40.120 --> 19:43.239
Well, I think I just drained
my weapon systems.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.719
But it's fixed.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.919
-This is a fixed point in time.
-Fixed points can be rewritten.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.639
No, they can't. Of course they can't.
Who told you?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.799
Well, what happened?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.559
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

19:58.640 --> 20:00.679
Nothing happened.
And then it kept happening.

20:00.760 --> 20:05.479
Or, if you'd prefer, everything happened
at once and it won't ever stop.

20:05.760 --> 20:10.719
Time is dying. It's going to be 5:02
in the afternoon for all eternity.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.279
-The needle's stuck on a record.
-A record?

20:14.360 --> 20:17.079
Good Lord, man,
have you never heard of downloads?

20:17.280 --> 20:18.519
Said Winston Churchill.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.879
(SNIFFING) Gun smoke. That's gun smoke.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.199
Oh, I appeared to have fired this.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.479
-We seem to be defending ourselves.
-I don't understand.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.159
The creatures that lead the Silence,
remarkable beings, they're memory-proof.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.679
-But what does that mean?
-Well, you can't remember them.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.599
The moment you look away,
you forget they were ever there.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.399
Don't panic.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.519
In small numbers,
they're not too difficult.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.079
(CHITTERING)

20:56.160 --> 20:58.159
(BEEPING)

21:00.280 --> 21:01.359
Go!

21:01.440 --> 21:03.519
-(SCREAMING)
-Go! Go! Go!

21:04.680 --> 21:08.279
Keep the Silence in sight at all times.
And keep your eye drives active.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.719
Who the devil are you?
Identify yourselves.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.999
Pond.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.639
Amelia Pond.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.759
(LAUGHING)

21:14.840 --> 21:17.119
No! She's on our side.
It's okay, Winston.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.799
DOCTOR: (WHISPERING) No.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.399
No, Amy.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.359
Amy.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.879
Why are you wearing the...

21:32.040 --> 21:35.159
MAN: The government is again apologising
for extensive radio interference

21:35.240 --> 21:38.039
caused by solar flare
and sunspot activity.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.199
Amy.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.879
Those stun guns aren't fun, I'm sorry.
I wanted to avoid a long conversation.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.199
You need to get up, though,
we'll be in Cairo shortly.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.279
Amy Pond.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.319
Amelia Pond from Leadworth,
please, listen to me.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.079
I know it seems impossible,
but you know me.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.079
In another version of reality,
you and I were best friends.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.399
We... We travelled together.
We had adventures.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.799
(GRUNTING)

22:10.560 --> 22:11.679
Amelia Pond.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.119
You grew up with a time rift
in the wall of your bedroom.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.039
You can see what others can't. You can
remember things that never happened.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.079
And if you try, if you really,
really try, you'll be able to...

22:24.160 --> 22:25.239
Oh.

22:28.320 --> 22:33.719
Oh!

22:39.720 --> 22:41.199
You look rubbish.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.719
You look wonderful.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.759
So do you. But don't worry.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.719
-We'll soon fix that.
-Oh.

22:48.800 --> 22:49.799
(LAUGHING)

22:50.240 --> 22:51.839
Geronimo!

22:54.320 --> 22:56.479
Okay, you can turn around now.
How do I look?

22:56.560 --> 22:57.839
-Cool.
-Really?

22:57.920 --> 22:59.879
-No.
-Cool office, though.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.359
Why do you have an office? Are you like
a special agent boss lady or something?

23:03.440 --> 23:06.319
-Not sure about the eye patch, though.
-It's not an eye patch.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.119
Time's gone wrong. Some of us noticed.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.439
There's a whole team of us
working on it. You'll see.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.319
And you've got an office on a train!
That is so cool!

23:13.400 --> 23:15.799
Can I have an office?
Never had an office before. Or a train.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.239
Or a train/office.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.639
God, I've missed you!

23:18.720 --> 23:21.239
Okay, hugging and missing now.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.479
-Where's the Roman?
-You mean Rory?

23:23.560 --> 23:26.519
-DOCTOR: Mmm.
-My husband, Rory, yeah? Um...

23:26.640 --> 23:28.959
That's him, isn't it? I have no idea.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.159
I can't find him.
I love him very much, don't I?

23:32.240 --> 23:33.399
Apparently.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.519
I have to keep doing this.
Writing and drawing things.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.599
It's just so hard to keep remembering.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.199
But it's not your fault.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.919
Time's gone wrong.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.719
Do you remember why?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.279
-Lakeside.
-Lake Silencio, Utah. I died.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.799
But then you didn't die. See,
I remember it twice, different ways.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.759
Two different versions
of the same event,

23:49.840 --> 23:51.439
both happening in the same moment.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.039
Time split wide open. Now look at it.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.279
All of history happening at once.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.239
But does it matter?
I mean, can't we just stay like this?

24:01.320 --> 24:05.239
Time isn't just frozen.
It's disintegrating.

24:06.640 --> 24:11.439
It will spread and spread and
all of reality will simply fall apart.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.159
(DOOR OPENING)

24:13.360 --> 24:15.199
Ma'am, we're about to arrive.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.679
Eye drives need to be activated
as soon as we disembark.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.439
Good point.
Thank you, Captain Williams.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.119
Hello.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.239
Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.759
Captain Williams, best of the best.
Couldn't live without him.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.759
(LAUGHING) No!

24:30.840 --> 24:32.199
What is wrong?

24:32.280 --> 24:35.159
Amy, you'll find your Rory,
you always do.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.879
-But you really have to look.
-I am looking!

24:37.960 --> 24:40.719
Oh, my Amelia Pond,

24:41.360 --> 24:42.959
you don't always look hard enough.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.599
Why are you older?

24:44.680 --> 24:47.959
If time isn't really passing,
then how can you be ageing?

24:48.040 --> 24:50.319
Time is still passing for me.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.679
Every explosion has an epicentre.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.639
I'm it.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.519
I'm what's wrong.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.439
What's wrong with you?

25:04.840 --> 25:06.479
I'm still alive.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.719
You have to put it on, sir.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.159
An eye patch? What for?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.239
-It's not an eye patch.
-It's an eye drive, sir.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.999
It communicates directly with the
memory centres of the brain.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.559
Acts as external storage.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.039
Only thing that works on them.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.919
Because no living mind
can remember these things.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.799
The Silence,

25:39.880 --> 25:41.839
we've captured over a hundred
of them now.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.799
All held in this pyramid.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.279
Yeah, I've encountered them before.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.959
Always wondered what they looked like?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.239
AMY: Well, put your eye drive on
and you'll retain the information,

25:51.320 --> 25:53.079
but only for as long
as you're wearing it.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.519
The Silence have human servants,
they all wear these?

25:55.600 --> 25:57.159
-They'd have to.
-This way.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.839
(CLICKING)

26:01.640 --> 26:03.839
They seem to be noticing you.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.759
Yeah, they would.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.279
So why aren't the human race
killing the Silence on sight any more?

26:09.360 --> 26:12.119
That was a whole other reality.
What are the tanks for?

26:12.200 --> 26:14.719
They can draw electricity from anything,
it's how they attack.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.879
The fluid insulates them

26:15.960 --> 26:18.439
and I really don't like the way
they're looking at you.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.239
-Me, neither.
-Ma'am.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.199
I'm sure it's nothing,
but I should really check this out.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.079
They haven't been this active
in a while.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.119
You two, upstairs.
Check all the tank seals.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.239
Then the floors above.
Get everyone checking.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.399
Sir.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.559
-You go ahead, ma'am.
-Thank you, Captain Williams.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.039
Doctor, this way.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.359
DOCTOR: Captain Williams, nice fella.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.519
-What's his first name?
-Captain. Just through here.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.599
Just, uh, give us a moment.
Just need to check something, ma'am.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.079
We're in. He's on his way.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.359
Loyal soldier, waiting to be noticed.
Always the pattern. Why is that?

26:52.440 --> 26:53.519
Sorry, sir?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.119
Your boss, you should just ask her out.
She likes you. She said so.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.359
Really, sir?

27:01.760 --> 27:03.399
CAPTAIN: What did she say?

27:04.320 --> 27:07.279
Oh, she just sort of
generally indicated.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.439
-What exactly did she say?
-She said that

27:09.520 --> 27:12.079
you were a Mr Hottie...ness.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.559
And that she would like to
go out with you for

27:16.200 --> 27:17.879
texting and scones.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.159
You really haven't done this
before, have you?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.759
No, I haven't.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.159
See you in a moment, sir.

27:30.240 --> 27:35.279
Yes.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.799
Come on, Doctor. Time for you
to meet some old friends.

27:41.200 --> 27:45.239
Attention, all personnel.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.799
Please check all the site
containment units.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.999
You were right.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.879
Just his presence in the building
caused the loop to extend

27:50.960 --> 27:53.039
by nearly four cronons.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.799
(BEEPING)

27:54.880 --> 27:56.639
Hi, honey, I'm home.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.959
And what sort of time do you call this?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.079
The death of time.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.959
The end of time.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.159
The end of us all.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.279
Oh, why couldn't you just die?

28:08.360 --> 28:12.519
Did my best, dear, I showed up. You just
can't get the psychopaths these days.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.199
Love what you've done with the pyramids!

28:15.280 --> 28:16.639
How did you swing all this?

28:16.720 --> 28:19.879
Hallucinogenic lipstick.
Works wonders on President Kennedy.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.959
And Cleopatra was a real pushover.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.759
-I always thought so.
-She mentioned you.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.599
-What did she say?
-"Put down that gun."

28:25.680 --> 28:27.039
-Did you?
-Eventually.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.159
Oh, they're flirting.
Do I have to watch this?

28:29.240 --> 28:32.279
It was such a basic mistake,
wasn't it, Madame Kovarian?

28:32.360 --> 28:34.959
Take a child, raise her into
a perfect psychopath,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.199
introduce her to the Doctor.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.519
Who else was I
going to fall in love with?

28:39.600 --> 28:41.919
That's not funny, River.
Reality is fatally compromised.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.719
Tell me you understand that.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.999
-Dinner?
-I don't have the time.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.879
Nobody has the time.
Because as long as I'm alive,

28:46.960 --> 28:50.159
time is dying, because of you, River.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.959
Because I refuse to kill the man I love.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.759
Oh, you love me, do you?
Aw, that's sweet of you...

28:53.840 --> 28:55.839
-Get him!
-Come here, you.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.119
I'm not a fool, sweetie.
I know what happens if we touch.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.479
Get off me!

29:04.560 --> 29:07.799
Get him off me! Doctor, no, let go!
Please. Let go!

29:07.880 --> 29:09.599
Moving...

29:09.680 --> 29:11.919
-Time's moving!
-Get him off me!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.319
-Doctor!
-I'm sorry, River, it's the only way.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.719
Ah!

29:25.800 --> 29:27.119
Cuff him!

29:27.280 --> 29:29.639
Oh, why do you always have handcuffs?

29:29.720 --> 29:32.359
It's the only way, River. We're the
opposite poles of the disruption.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.559
If we touch, we short out the
differential. Time can begin again.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.399
And I'll be by a lakeside, killing you.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.439
And time won't fall apart.
The clocks will tick.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.999
Reality will continue.
There isn't another way.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.279
I didn't say there was, sweetie.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.359
(CRACKING)

30:05.560 --> 30:06.759
(WATER DRIPPING)

30:16.920 --> 30:18.279
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

30:21.920 --> 30:24.039
RIVER: There are so many theories
about you and I, you know?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.679
-Idle gossip.
-Archaeology.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.639
-Same thing!
-Am I the woman who marries you

30:28.800 --> 30:30.719
-or the woman who murders you?
-Oh.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.599
-I don't want to marry you.
-I don't want to murder you.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.319
-(WATER DRIPPING)
-DOCTOR: Well, this is no fun at all.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.479
It isn't, is it?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.799
Doctor, what's that?

30:44.480 --> 30:46.119
DOCTOR: The pyramid above us.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.639
How many Silence have you got
trapped inside it?

30:48.720 --> 30:52.679
None. They're not trapped.
They never have been.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.519
They've been waiting.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.199
For this, Doctor.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.599
For you.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.999
They're out! All of them!

31:01.080 --> 31:02.159
(CHITTERING)

31:03.680 --> 31:05.399
MAN: Fall back!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.199
(SCREAMING)

31:09.720 --> 31:11.119
(MEN SCREAMING)

31:13.200 --> 31:14.599
CAPTAIN: No one gets in here.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.159
Ma'am, my men out there
should be able to lock this down.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.319
We have them outnumbered.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.479
And you're wearing eye drives
based on mine, I think. Whoops.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.079
What do you mean?

31:24.960 --> 31:26.079
(SCREAMING)

31:26.160 --> 31:27.879
Help her! Help her!

31:29.320 --> 31:30.479
(SCREAMING)

31:31.120 --> 31:32.239
She's dead.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.279
MAN: Fall back now!

31:36.360 --> 31:42.879
(SCREAMING)

31:43.280 --> 31:45.559
Eye drives off now! Remove them!

31:45.680 --> 31:49.799
Ahh!

31:49.880 --> 31:52.159
The Silence would
never allow an advantage

31:52.240 --> 31:54.319
without taking one themselves.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.919
The effects will vary
from person to person,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.399
either death or debilitating agony.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.359
But they will take you all, one by one.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.119
What are you doing? No, it's me.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.479
Don't be stupid!

32:13.120 --> 32:14.519
You need me.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.319
Stop it!

32:17.400 --> 32:18.479
Stop that!

32:18.560 --> 32:20.119
We can stop this right now, you and I.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.319
Get it off me!

32:21.400 --> 32:22.959
-Amy, tell her!
-We've been working on something.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.919
-Just let us show you.
-No point. There's nothing you can do.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.399
-My time is up.
-We're doing this for you!

32:26.480 --> 32:29.119
And people are dying for me.
I won't thank you for that, Amelia Pond.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.319
-Just let us show you.
-Please!

32:34.120 --> 32:35.479
Captain Williams, how long do we have?

32:35.560 --> 32:37.319
Ah, a couple of minutes?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.039
That's enough.
We're going to the receptor room,

32:39.120 --> 32:40.639
right at the top of the pyramid.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.479
I hope you're ready for a climb.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.399
I'll wait down here, ma'am,
buy you as much time as I can.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.399
-You'll have to take your eye drive off.
-Can't do that, ma'am.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.519
-Can't forget what's coming.
-But it could activate any second.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.399
It has activated, ma'am.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.799
But I'm of no use to you
if I can't remember.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.679
You have to go now, ma'am!

32:57.760 --> 32:58.839
-Yes.
-Now.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.799
Yes. Thank you, Captain Williams.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.479
(BANGING ON DOOR)

33:17.840 --> 33:20.319
(SCREAMING)

33:24.000 --> 33:27.519
SILENT: Rory Williams,
the man who dies

33:27.600 --> 33:29.559
and dies again.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.039
Die one last time.

33:32.120 --> 33:36.199
And know she will
never come back for you.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.839
(RORY SCREAMING)

33:43.920 --> 33:46.399
Come on, you, up you get. You all right?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.639
(SHOUTING)

33:50.040 --> 33:52.839
Amy, help me.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.799
You took my baby from me.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.319
And hurt her.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.559
And now she's all grown up
and she's fine,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.519
but I'll never see my baby again.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.999
But you'll still save me, though.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.039
Because he would.

34:09.120 --> 34:14.359
And you'd never do anything to
disappoint your precious Doctor.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.239
Ma'am, we have to go, now!

34:16.320 --> 34:18.639
The Doctor is very precious to me,
you're right.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.599
But do you know what else he is,
Madame Kovarian?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.799
Not here.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.599
(GASPING) Ah!

34:28.280 --> 34:30.639
River Song didn't get it all from you,

34:30.720 --> 34:31.959
sweetie.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.879
(SCREAMING)

34:35.960 --> 34:37.639
So, you and me, we should
get a drink sometime.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.159
-Okay.
-I'm married.

34:39.240 --> 34:40.319
Fine.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.479
(MEN SCREAMING)

34:46.560 --> 34:50.239
What's this? Oh, it's a tiny-winy
distress beacon. Who built this?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.999
I'm in charge of the Tardis.
I understand the physics.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.239
Yes, but that's all you've got,
is a distress beacon?

34:55.320 --> 34:58.159
I've been sending out a message.
A distress call.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.119
Outside the bubble of our time,
the universe is still turning

35:01.200 --> 35:02.759
and I've sent a message everywhere.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.359
To the future and the past,

35:04.440 --> 35:06.559
the beginning and the end of everything.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.319
"The Doctor is dying,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.599
"please, please help."

35:10.680 --> 35:12.959
River! River, this is ridiculous!

35:13.040 --> 35:15.159
That would mean nothing to anyone.
It's insane!

35:15.240 --> 35:17.039
Worse, it's stupid!

35:18.280 --> 35:19.879
You embarrass me!

35:19.960 --> 35:23.279
We barricaded the door,
we've got a few minutes. Just tell him.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.799
Just tell him, River!

35:24.880 --> 35:27.239
Those reports of the sunspots
and the solar flares,

35:27.600 --> 35:29.679
they're wrong. There aren't any.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.999
It's not the sun. It's you.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.039
The sky is full
of a million, million voices

35:35.880 --> 35:39.039
saying, "Yes, of course. We'll help."

35:40.120 --> 35:43.399
You've touched so many lives,
saved so many people.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.439
Did you think when your time came

35:45.520 --> 35:48.359
you'd really have to do
more than just ask?

35:49.160 --> 35:52.479
You've decided that the universe
is better off without you.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.239
But the universe doesn't agree.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.359
River, no one can help me.

35:57.440 --> 36:01.079
A fixed point has been altered.
Time is disintegrating.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.479
I can't let you die!

36:02.560 --> 36:04.719
-But I have to die!
-Shut up!

36:05.800 --> 36:07.719
I can't let you die

36:08.800 --> 36:10.959
without knowing you are loved.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.959
By so many, and so much!

36:15.200 --> 36:17.239
And by no one more than me.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.119
River, you and I,
we know what this means.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.519
You know, we are ground zero of an
explosion that will engulf all reality.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.759
Billions on billions
will suffer and die.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.159
I'll suffer if I have to kill you.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.199
More than every living
thing in the universe?

36:38.880 --> 36:39.959
Yes.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.679
River, River. Why do you
have to be this?

36:50.080 --> 36:53.439
Melody Pond! Your daughter!
I hope you're both proud!

36:54.880 --> 36:56.319
I'm not sure I completely understand.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.439
Um, we got married
and had a kid and that's her.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.639
Okay.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.479
Amy, uncuff me now.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.639
Okay, I need a strip of cloth
about a foot long. Anything will do.

37:21.720 --> 37:24.359
Never mind. River, take one end of this.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.239
Wrap it around your hand
and hold it out to me.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.839
-What am I doing?
-As you're told.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.399
Now, we're in the middle
of a combat zone,

37:31.480 --> 37:32.919
so we'll have to do the quick version.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.199
Captain Williams, say,
"I consent and gladly give."

37:36.400 --> 37:38.879
-To what?
-Just say it! Please.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.839
I consent and gladly give.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.559
Need you to say it, too.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.279
Mother of the bride.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.839
I consent and gladly give.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.999
Now, River, I am about to whisper
something in your ear

37:52.080 --> 37:54.639
and you have to remember it
very, very carefully

37:54.720 --> 37:57.679
and tell no one what I said.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.359
I just told you my name.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.879
Now, there you go, River Song,

38:14.720 --> 38:16.279
Melody Pond.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.599
You're the woman who married me.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.479
And, wife, I have a request.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.839
This world is dying and it's my fault.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.239
And I can't bear it another day.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.319
Please, help me.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.519
There isn't another way.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.359
Then you may kiss the bride.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.599
I'll make it a good one.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.079
You'd better.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.479
DOCTOR: And you are forgiven.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.999
Always and completely forgiven.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.319

(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

39:52.840 --> 39:55.759
Heard there was a freak
meteor shower two miles away.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.399
So I got us a bottle.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.039
Thank you, dear.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.719
So, where are we?

40:02.800 --> 40:05.279
I just climbed out of the Byzantium.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.639
You were there. So young.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.719
Didn't have a clue who I was.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.919
-Hmm?
-You're funny like that.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.999
Where are you?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.119
The Doctor is dead.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.719
How are you doing?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.839
How do you think?

40:25.160 --> 40:26.959
Well, I don't know, unless you tell me.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.679
I killed someone.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.759
Madame Kovarian.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.959
In cold blood.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.039
In an aborted timeline,
in a world that never was.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.719
Yeah, but I can remember it,
so it happened, so I did it.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.679
What does that make me now?

40:49.440 --> 40:52.839
I need to talk to the Doctor,
but I can't now, can I?

40:54.680 --> 40:57.399
If you could talk to him,
would it make a difference?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.639
He's dead so... So I can't.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.439
Oh, Mother! Of course he isn't!

41:04.960 --> 41:06.879
Not for you, I suppose.

41:07.160 --> 41:11.759
You're seeing the younger versions of
them, running around, having adventures.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.639
Yeah, I am.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.599
But that's not what I mean.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.599
Then what do you mean?

41:20.280 --> 41:21.479
Okay,

41:22.680 --> 41:25.839
I'm going to tell you
what I probably shouldn't.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.039
The Doctor's last secret.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.999
Don't you want to know
what he whispered in my ear?

41:31.080 --> 41:33.039
-He whispered his name.
-Not his name, no.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.479
Yeah, it was. He said it was.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.919
-Rule one?
-The Doctor lies.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.239
So do I. All the time. Have to.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.479
Spoilers.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.199
Pretending I don't know
you're my mother,

41:43.280 --> 41:45.999
pretending I didn't recognise
a space suit in Florida.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.559
-What did he whisper in your ear?
-Oh...

41:49.520 --> 41:50.799
that man!

41:52.080 --> 41:54.879
He was always one step
ahead of everyone. Always a plan.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.639
River, what did he tell you?

41:58.960 --> 42:00.079
River?

42:00.160 --> 42:01.159

(INDISTINCT)

42:19.840 --> 42:21.919
-(RIVER LAUGHING)
-Are you sure, River?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.079
-Are you really, properly sure?
-Of course I'm sure! I'm his wife!

42:25.160 --> 42:26.919
Yes! And I'm his...

42:27.200 --> 42:28.679
mother-in-law.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.759
Father, dear, I think Mummy
might need another drink.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.439
Yes, yes.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.679
DORIUM: Who's carrying me?

42:41.200 --> 42:42.839
I demand to know!

42:43.760 --> 42:45.759
I'm a head. I have rights!

42:47.720 --> 42:50.119
I want my doors open this time.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.039
I demand that my doors are open!

42:59.200 --> 43:01.639
Is it you? It is, isn't it?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.319
It is you. I can sense it!

43:06.280 --> 43:08.559
But how did you do it?

43:08.840 --> 43:11.359
How could you have possibly escaped?

43:11.680 --> 43:13.919
Is there nothing else we can do?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.199
Actually, thinking about it...

43:21.280 --> 43:22.919
Look into my eye.

43:28.560 --> 43:29.679
Shh!

43:37.920 --> 43:41.719
The Tesselecta.
A Doctor in a Doctor's suit.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.319
Time said I had to be on that beach,
so I dressed for the occasion.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.519
Barely got singed in that boat.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.959
So you're going to do this,
let them all think you're dead?

43:50.040 --> 43:51.639
It's the only way.
Then they can all forget me.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.319
I got too big, Dorium, too noisy.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.319
Time to step back into the shadows.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.399
And Dr Song? In prison all her days?

44:00.480 --> 44:02.519
Her days, yes. Her nights...

44:03.120 --> 44:06.439
Well, that's between her and me, eh?

44:06.520 --> 44:09.399
So many secrets, Doctor.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.399
I'll help you keep them, of course.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.079
Well, you're not exactly going anywhere,
are you?

44:13.160 --> 44:14.959
But you're a fool, nonetheless.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.879
It's all still waiting for you.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.879
The Fields of Trenzalor,
the fall of the Eleventh

44:19.960 --> 44:21.559
and the question.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.599
Goodbye, Dorium.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.399
The first question.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.359
The question that must
never be answered!

44:29.880 --> 44:31.719
Hidden in plain sight!

44:32.600 --> 44:36.519
The question you've been
running from all your life!

44:37.040 --> 44:45.679
Doctor who?
