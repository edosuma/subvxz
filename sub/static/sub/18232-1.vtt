WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.801
Why'd you
break up with her?

00:02.803 --> 00:04.503
Seven reasons, actually.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.638
Number one, she doesn't vote.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.473
Eh?

00:07.475 --> 00:09.174
Shh.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.710
Number two, she cheered for
Bulgaria in the last Olympics.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.213
Bulgarians don't
even cheer for Bulgaria.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.347
Ok, so it
was one Bulgarian,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.850
and he was missing an arm.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.351
The rest of the time,
she cheered for America?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.552
Yes.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.621
Ok, that one's
a stretch too.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.556
Look, why don't you just
forget your seven reasons

00:24.558 --> 00:26.191
and admit that you
only need one to talk

00:26.193 --> 00:27.292
yourself out of any girl?

00:27.294 --> 00:28.227
What's that?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.628
That she's not Emily.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.330
False.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.332
You've been in love with
Emily since the third grade.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.869
No one's ever gonna measure up.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.337
That's probably true.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:47.414 --> 00:49.848
Emily atkins.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.850
Imagine every day, a
12-year-old supermodel

00:51.852 --> 00:54.219
literally turned your
hallway into a runway--

00:54.221 --> 00:56.321
a runway of love.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.690
Are you sure you're
not exaggerating a bit?

00:58.692 --> 01:00.059
I don't even need to.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.061
She was perfect in every way.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.062
I doubt that.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.495
Trust me.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.532
While other kids were
building basic housing,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.567
she was building eiffel towers.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.935
So she was French?

01:09.937 --> 01:13.872
Nope, but she
spoke French fluently.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.507
She was probably
the most thoughtful

01:15.509 --> 01:16.942
person that ever existed.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.344
One time, she had all
the kids in school

01:19.346 --> 01:22.081
sign a card for Mrs. lackra
when she broke her arm.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.283
She even brought her flowers.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.518
Or maybe that was her birthday.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.921
I can't remember.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.523
This year's humanitarian award
for her work with homeless

01:31.525 --> 01:34.426
homing pigeons and reprogramming
the left handed, Emily atkins.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.399
I was in
awe of her, never

01:40.401 --> 01:43.235
dreaming that on June
4th, 2004, at 3:26 pm,

01:43.237 --> 01:45.537
she would take my heart,
throw it in a backpack,

01:45.539 --> 01:47.940
toss it in a Van, and
drive away with it.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.308
You poor thing.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.043
I was devastated.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.811
It was the worst day of my life.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.912
Really?

01:53.914 --> 01:54.947
Yep.

01:54.949 --> 01:55.647
And I haven't seen her since.

02:01.988 --> 02:05.157
It was the kind of love you
only get one chance at in life,

02:05.159 --> 02:09.761
and I let it slip
through my fingers.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.097
Quite a love
story, considering

02:12.099 --> 02:13.465
you never even spoke to her.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.168
Yes I did, once.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.503
What'd you say?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.438
Ahh, that's a
moment that I'd like

02:19.440 --> 02:21.773
to keep between me and Emily.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.376
Look, I licked a leprechaun.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.619
Ok, I think they got it.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.687
Hold on, I'll
turn on the lantern.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.789
Dang it, I said hold on!

02:37.791 --> 02:39.424
Ok.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.792
I think we should go
get Tully before I

02:40.794 --> 02:41.960
burn this whole place down.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.295
He's not going
to be in any hurry

02:43.297 --> 02:44.763
if you don't pay your
half of the rent.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.697
I will, all right?

02:45.699 --> 02:48.300
I just got a little behind.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.536
Who knew car repairs
would be so expensive?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.271
Everyone.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
You kidding me?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.541
You actually wrote
down the reasons why?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.142
I'm a visual thinker.

02:57.144 --> 03:01.547
"Seven reasons to dump someone"
just looks bad on paper.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.714
Dang it.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.049
I told you not to
leave your stuff

03:04.051 --> 03:04.983
in the middle of the floor.
-No, no, no.

03:04.985 --> 03:05.984
Just shut up, all right?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.319
I'm lecturing you right now.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.854
All right, you're
never going to find

03:08.856 --> 03:10.822
a girl as perfect as Emily.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.491
Once you've been in the
presence of perfection,

03:12.493 --> 03:14.059
it's hard to settle
for anything less.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.496
Yeah, but you've become
such a nit picky freak.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.730
It's a gift.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.565
Tell that to your sister.

03:23.503 --> 03:24.570
Come on, Lexie.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.971
The guy's a loser.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.206
He's not.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.473
And tell me this.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.209
He slept through
"sleepless in Seattle,"

03:30.211 --> 03:32.077
the greatest romantic
comedy of all time,

03:32.079 --> 03:34.980
but what does he have to say
about the transformers movies?

03:34.982 --> 03:37.883
That there should be a
best picture consideration.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.084
For which one?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.986
All of them.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.221
Case closed.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.555
Why would you do that?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
That's terrible.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.925
Ok, there are studies that
show that cracking your knuckles

03:46.927 --> 03:48.527
isn't bad for you.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.396
Lexie, dump him.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.031
He's cute.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.600
Cute won't keep
the conversations

03:54.602 --> 03:57.769
from drifting to the underrated
talents of Megan fox.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.038
Have I ever steered
you wrong before?

04:00.040 --> 04:03.008
Pet coyote incident
of 2003 comes to mind.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.176
Fond memories.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.411
Yeah, rabies shots
are memorable.

04:26.065 --> 04:26.798
What?

04:52.659 --> 04:54.059
Hey, you want a smoothie?

04:57.063 --> 04:57.896
Oh, man.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.564
We're in trouble.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.166
Quick, grab the
cord from the hall.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.901
Oh, someone's there.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.304
Shoot, it's probably Tully.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.171
Oh, man.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.310
Are you Matt?

05:17.417 --> 05:19.084
There we go.

05:19.086 --> 05:23.922
I'm taking the power
strip and the smoothie.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.524
When can I expect the rest?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.359
Of the smoothie?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.694
Of the rent.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.095
Soon.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.130
There are a couple of
unforeseen expenses.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.000
And I'm asking for a raise
tomorrow at Martin's computers.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.135
Do you think
you're gonna get it?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.437
I deserve it.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.705
Who's your boss?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.373
The skinny guy with the toupee?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.808
You want me to go
down there and--

05:43.844 --> 05:46.345
what, beat him up?

05:46.347 --> 05:47.779
No.

05:47.781 --> 05:52.517
But I could threaten to
rewire his ceiling fan,

05:52.519 --> 05:54.219
make it run backwards.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.521
You know there's a
switch for that, right?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.657
Yeah, good point.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.792
That'll save me some time.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.960
Anyway, I need the rent.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.729
My wife wants to
get her face waxed.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.731
What does that even mean?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.299
I don't know.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.534
Some new spa place are
doing a three for one sale.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.370
She's also getting
her ears exfoliated

06:11.372 --> 06:12.738
and her elbows bleached.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.406
It's going to cost me $500.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.074
But it'll be worth it if i
don't recognize her afterwards.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.413
Whatever, we have power.

06:25.818 --> 06:26.752
Here you go.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.853
Thank you.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.354
How much do I owe you?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.756
No charge.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.991
Oh, could they not fix it.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.060
I knew what the problem
was, so I didn't bother

06:35.062 --> 06:37.662
getting a technician involved.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.430
Don't tell anyone.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.066
Oh, thank you.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.167
You're welcome.
Have a nice day.

06:42.169 --> 06:42.934
Thank you.

06:42.936 --> 06:43.969
Same to you.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.278
Don't think of it
as me firing you.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.948
Think of it as store
policy firing you.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.618
You didn't follow the rules.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.722
You gave a few people their
computers back without charge.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.557
It adds up.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.960
Cathy will be sending
you your final paycheck.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.129
She's right down the hall.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.531
We went out one time.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.565
She's really nice.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.534
We had dinner.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.166
I can work here.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.601
Please.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.502
You don't know the first
thing about arranging.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.006
Some people would
love this design.

07:55.008 --> 07:55.807
Really?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.608
Who?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.442
Who would love that?

07:57.444 --> 07:58.677
Anarchists.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.479
People who like
disorder and mayhem.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.682
Those guys always put weird
things in their apartments.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.017
You know, another option--

08:06.019 --> 08:08.353
no, you cannot live with me.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.823
But you can stop hanging
around here and go get a job.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.091
Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.593
Hey, Lexie.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.161
You here to pick up the
flowers for the hospital?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.329
Yes, I am.
Thank you.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.497
Cool, be right back.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.932
Oh, I saw your
mother last week.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.434
She's my favorite nurse.

08:22.436 --> 08:25.170
Oh, well, you're her
favorite volunteer.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.973
She said that you
had a break up.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.875
Are you ok?

08:29.877 --> 08:30.675
I'm fine.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.843
Ok.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.345
You'll bounce back.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.279
I'll get your order.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.553
You're Ethan, aren't you?

08:41.554 --> 08:43.321
Oh, yes ma'am.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.057
Your
mother brags about you.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.559
In what way?

08:47.561 --> 08:50.829
She said you're the Helen
Keller of relationships.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.798
She thinks I'm blind and
deaf when it comes to women?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.901
No, you're the miracle worker.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.404
Oh, you mean her
teacher, Amy Sullivan?

08:59.406 --> 09:00.705
How's that?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.541
You help the love
struck Helen kellers

09:02.543 --> 09:06.411
by shining light on flaws
that they're too blind to see.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.013
I don't understand.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.650
You talked Lexie into
ending it with her boyfriend.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.519
Well, ultimately it was her
decision to do that, but--

09:14.521 --> 09:17.088
did you convince her
to break up with him?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.723
Kinda.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.659
There you have it.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.193
Your parents hated that boy.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.095
In fact, that they told
me that you've saved

09:24.097 --> 09:26.264
Lexie from a few disasters.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.866
She listens to me.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.267
Why?

09:29.269 --> 09:32.103
She trusts me, and I'm
just good at spotting

09:32.105 --> 09:33.872
incompatibilities.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.708
Why the 20 questions?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.577
Could
you do that for me?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.578
Excuse me?

09:39.580 --> 09:40.712
- Oh.
- Here you go.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.880
Thank you.

09:41.882 --> 09:45.050
Um, how much is this?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.017
$10.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.552
Sold.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.622
We have a blind patient
and it's her birthday,

09:50.624 --> 09:55.193
so could you put a ribbon on it?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.095
Thanks.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.064
Can you get rid of my
daughter's boyfriend?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.131
Uh.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.133
Please, I've tried everything.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.768
I've never even
met your daughter.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.970
Yes you have, in
elementary school.

10:04.972 --> 10:05.770
Veronica.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.138
No, I'm sorry.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.807
I don't remember, and
i seriously doubt--

10:08.809 --> 10:13.078
I don't want grandchildren
with no ambition and big ears.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.112
Have you talked to her?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.413
I'm her mother!

10:15.415 --> 10:16.615
She doesn't listen to me.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.216
But she might listen
to a stranger.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.651
Nuh uh.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.552
I'll pay you.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.302
We
should use code names.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.504
I don't think that's necessary.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.273
Oh, ok.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.375
All right, this is Veronica.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.780
It's like freaking tinder.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.115
They're all group photos.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.083
I have no idea which one she is.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.318
That's Veronica.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.286
She's pretty.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.087
Thank you.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.455
And that's Zach.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.024
Big ears.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.625
Thank you.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.160
This is information on her.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.632
She has a Maltese named beauty.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.267
Oh, we could get you one, too!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.679
Whoa, whoa-- chill, boy.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.380
I'm so sorry, he's
easily excited.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.015
Oh, he is so cute.

11:24.017 --> 11:24.983
What's his name?

11:24.985 --> 11:28.386
Uh, I just call him beast.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.721
Ethan Cooper?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.122
Veronica Taylor.

11:31.124 --> 11:31.956
Yeah.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.692
Huh, you remember me.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.492
Yeah.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.660
It's been forever.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.830
Yeah, it has.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.131
That's a cute dog.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.866
Oh, thanks.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.501
I made a list of
things I don't like about him.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.170
Huh, that's what I do.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.639
I thought
maybe you could use this.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.741
Lack of motivation,
doesn't save money.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.710
Not that he has
that much money to begin with,

11:51.712 --> 11:53.745
he works at a fast food place.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.214
Fast food alone has
destroyed many relationships

11:56.216 --> 11:58.149
with the weight gain.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.884
I'm
not that patient.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.054
Um, I don't know if
this list is going to work.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.090
These aren't things
people my age care about.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.391
They think in the present.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.225
Ok.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.827
So what then?

12:08.829 --> 12:13.198
What I'm looking for are
quirks, habits, annoying things

12:13.200 --> 12:14.432
about him.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.668
So your boyfriend
is Zach winstead?

12:16.670 --> 12:17.435
Yeah.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.536
Do you know him?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.371
Yeah, i-- uh, I do.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.940
Great guy.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.909
I mean, except for
the toothpick thing.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.177
What?

12:26.179 --> 12:27.579
He always has a
toothpick in his mouth.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.380
It's like a redneck way
of being pretentious.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.349
It's weird.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.517
Plus, the mouth noises he makes?

12:32.519 --> 12:33.284
Ugh.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.423
And you got to admit, he
talks like a junior high girl.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.091
Did you see that tweet or not?
Eww.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.226
Oh my gosh, they're so annoying.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.193
Basic as they get.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.061
Is that Chelsea?

12:43.063 --> 12:43.962
What the what?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.396
Hey, we bout to turn up!

12:45.398 --> 12:47.732
I hate Josh hutcherson
so much, I can't even.

12:47.734 --> 12:48.633
Jk, I'm jelly.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.568
But seriously.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.037
And you know, should he
really be dancing in public?

13:02.248 --> 13:04.149
Oh, i-- uh, I got to go.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.117
Do you wanna hang
out this weekend?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.585
Huh?

13:07.587 --> 13:08.753
What?

13:08.755 --> 13:11.156
I like hanging out with you.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.891
Uh, I don't know.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.160
I'm not sure about hanging out
with someone else's girlfriend.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.062
I don't want to cause
any trouble there.

13:18.064 --> 13:18.930
Oh.

13:18.932 --> 13:19.731
So--

13:19.733 --> 13:20.665
yeah, ok.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.466
Yeah.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.302
See ya.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.603
Wait.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.038
Don't you want your dog?

13:30.276 --> 13:31.009
Thanks.

13:34.079 --> 13:37.448
Stupid dog, you
make me look bad.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.183
Bye.

13:44.523 --> 13:45.757
I don't think it's working out.

14:01.040 --> 14:01.840
What's up?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.607
I'm Zach.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.546
What am I supposed
to do with this dog?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.048
Take him back to the shelter?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.382
Is that what I am now?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.184
I use dogs and then
toss them back?

14:17.122 --> 14:18.389
Hey.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.191
I heard barking.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.660
You're not allowed
to have a dog.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.862
We named him after you.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.830
Tully?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.298
Beast.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.399
Ok.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.235
But I get to walk
him on Tuesdays.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.970
Tuesday is velma's
Katherine heigl movie night.

14:31.972 --> 14:32.704
Deal.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.710
Hey, do you think
this girl was into you?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.979
Definitely.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.046
Was she cute?

14:42.048 --> 14:45.650
Sure, but kinda weird too.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.185
There's this new girl.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.921
You know, as someone who
hasn't been in a relationship

14:49.923 --> 14:52.857
for a while, I think you have
to move past the weird thing.

14:52.859 --> 14:53.825
Was she breathing?

14:53.827 --> 14:55.360
Look who's talking.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.861
You haven't had a girlfriend
since the fourth grade.

14:56.863 --> 15:00.431
I've had a lot of girlfriends.
Ok, two.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.100
Oh, wait-- uh, yeah.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.768
Two.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.771
And this is why I'm taking
relationship advice from you?

15:06.773 --> 15:09.340
Do dogs eat, like, every day?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.276
Yes they do.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.410
Don't you?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.945
Don't you?

15:13.947 --> 15:14.679
Kaching.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.387
What?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.721
What?

15:23.723 --> 15:26.691
Look.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.126
Oh, dagnabbit.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.434
The flying monkey
has landed, minus

15:36.436 --> 15:38.436
the munchkin-eared albatross.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.271
What is happening?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.473
Great doing business with you.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.609
Glad I could help.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.277
Can I recommend
you to some people?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.613
What do you mean?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.815
You'd be surprised how
many parents dislike

15:50.817 --> 15:52.083
their daughters' boyfriends.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.613
Hello?

18:02.615 --> 18:03.614
Sure, I can do that for you.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.417
I just need a few details.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.619
What's your daughter's name?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.021
Ok.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.523
What's the issue you
have with her boyfriend?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.959
Butcher's daughter
dating vegetarian.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.761
Never gonna work.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.795
Ok, I'll need more.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.231
Is he possessive, lazy, stupid?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.599
Any, you know, strange habits?

18:30.642 --> 18:32.143
Tell you what.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.744
Think about it, write
some down, and we'll meet

18:33.746 --> 18:35.546
for coffee on Thursday, ok?

18:35.548 --> 18:36.314
Sounds good.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.615
Thanks.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.449
Where is she?

18:38.451 --> 18:39.283
Pump three.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.738
Ok, we stay here
until she clears out.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.573
Wait, I thought you were on
your way to meet a client?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.976
I guess I'm going to be late.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.077
I don't know, man.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.012
I think you should just give in.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.514
She wants you.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.515
That's half the battle.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.315
Wait, hold up.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.650
That is the battle.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.452
Wrong battlefield.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.020
Really though, you
should get rid of Lexie.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.321
She's cramping your style.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.856
Absolutely not.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.092
She is the only way I'm
keeping these girls at bay.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.094
Besides, they open
up to me if they

19:23.096 --> 19:24.996
know I'm not trying to move in.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.298
I don't think Veronica really
cares about your girlfriend.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.269
She already knows Lexie is my
sister, so that doesn't work.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.871
Can you just start
sending these girls my way?

19:33.873 --> 19:34.805
You don't want them.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.973
Because--?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.642
Same reasons i
don't want them--

19:37.644 --> 19:39.610
incompatible personalities,
blubbering about their break

19:39.612 --> 19:40.978
up, weird habits
you'd have to live

19:40.980 --> 19:42.613
with for the rest of your life.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.282
Trust me.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.650
Still.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.384
Oh, she's coming.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.669
Ethan?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.871
Veronica, hey.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.506
What are you guys doing here?

20:08.508 --> 20:12.376
Oh, we're just picking up
some-- his mom asked us to--

20:12.378 --> 20:13.544
you know, it's so funny.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.512
I was just on my
way to your house

20:14.514 --> 20:17.648
to invite you to my party.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.916
Oh, wow, Friday?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.351
Mm.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.652
Any other day would have
been fine, but Friday--

20:21.654 --> 20:22.420
yeah, we have that--

20:22.422 --> 20:23.354
right, that uh--

20:23.356 --> 20:24.422
that thing.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.325
Minor surgery.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.593
The
party's on Thursday.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.361
The flyer says Friday.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.429
The party's on Thursday.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.364
Sentinel creek park at sunset.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.733
Aww, that's where beauty
and the beast first met.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.001
Yeah.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.869
I can't leave that
crossed my mind.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.772
Ok, well, since you're
free on Thursday,

20:41.774 --> 20:43.140
I guess I'll see you there.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.078
Bye.

20:47.080 --> 20:47.845
Bye, Sam.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.119
Dude, you know you're the
only one invited to that party.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.020
I know.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.725
His name is Brian.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.226
And you don't like him?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.894
I like him fine.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.597
It's just that after her dad
died, she's all I have left.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.700
I don't want her wasting
her life with this boy.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.735
What's wrong with him?

21:10.737 --> 21:11.902
Nothing.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.071
I just want her
to be with Thomas.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.640
Thomas is?

21:15.642 --> 21:17.275
My future son-in-law.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.077
He's a lawyer, about
to become partner.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.546
Brian is just an
accountant and will be

21:22.548 --> 21:25.116
doing Thomas's taxes one day.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.417
Ok.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.885
So what else do you
know about Brian?

21:27.887 --> 21:30.454
I know he's not Thomas.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.623
It's just that it
would help if you could

21:32.625 --> 21:34.325
give me some more information.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.061
You know, any ex-girlfriends,
multiple Facebook accounts,

21:37.063 --> 21:38.963
bad credit history.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.232
I know nothing, but
isn't that your job

21:41.234 --> 21:43.501
to uncover the secrets?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.002
I suppose.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.338
I can certainly give it
a shot with what we have.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.506
Good.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.840
I'll pay you
regular rates if you

21:49.842 --> 21:51.842
can break them up,
and double if you can

21:51.844 --> 21:53.444
get her interested in Thomas.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.612
That's not really what I do.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.980
Quadruple.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.248
But I've been looking
into branching out.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.249
Good.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.483
Would you like to meet her?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.185
I would.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.120
She works at the art gallery
and is scheduled for tomorrow,

22:03.122 --> 22:05.856
but she also sings nights
at the green lady lounge.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.824
Show starts at 9:00.

22:14.299 --> 22:18.269
Don't like
it when the bad guy wins,

22:18.271 --> 22:22.173
I must confess that, I can say.

22:22.175 --> 22:30.114
Every story needs a happy
ending at the end of the day.

22:30.116 --> 22:37.054
Don't like to rock the boat,
it doesn't mean I'm lazy.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.991
I like to paint
outside the lines,

22:40.993 --> 22:43.994
it doesn't make me crazy.

22:43.996 --> 22:48.833
I'm a girl who mouths
the words at every play.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.702
Emily?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.237
Who's that girl singing?

22:53.239 --> 22:54.138
Emily atkins.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.639
Quite the voice, huh?

22:55.641 --> 22:58.175
Yeah.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.510
Quite the everything.

22:59.512 --> 23:03.414
I'm just
funny that way.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.880
Um, hello.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.681
Hi.

23:37.683 --> 23:42.186
I just wanted to say how much
i enjoyed your performance.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.554
Oh, thank you.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.688
Yeah.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.090
Uh, it was good.

23:46.092 --> 23:51.796
You were a really cool
jazz, um, cat up there.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.067
Don't I know you?

23:57.069 --> 24:00.271
Uh, no.

24:00.273 --> 24:04.708
Um, from Jefferson elementary.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.944
What's your name?

24:06.946 --> 24:09.113
Ethan Cooper.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.114
Oh, yeah.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.115
I do remember you.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.750
Yeah, yeah.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.752
I realized it was you the
second I walked in here.

24:14.754 --> 24:18.389
You always did
have a great voice.

24:18.391 --> 24:20.825
When did you hear me sing?

24:20.827 --> 24:23.093
Well, you had a solo in
the third grade musical.

24:23.095 --> 24:27.298
You know, Mr.
dragon Lilly's farm?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.967
Yeah, i-- um, I was a turnip.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.236
I sang like, one line.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.437
Right.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.673
I mean, it was just
memorable to me

24:35.675 --> 24:41.645
because it inspired me
to go organic and put

24:41.647 --> 24:45.716
turnips in stews and
various other recipes.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.119
Turnips?

24:49.121 --> 24:50.521
I know.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.989
I had to go on for
another minute and a half

24:51.991 --> 24:55.326
about my infatuation with
turnips just to cover.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.695
To cover your
infatuation with her?

24:57.697 --> 24:58.596
She's still perfect.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.600
Hey, would you get your
feet off the table?

25:02.602 --> 25:04.535
That's disgusting.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.470
Velma went through a
weird vegetable phase, too.

25:06.472 --> 25:09.673
You guys know what chard is?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.108
No.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.644
It's like the fat free
yogurt of vegetables,

25:13.646 --> 25:16.881
which is bad because vegetables
are like the soy milk of food.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.482
Ethan, you need a
new oven igniter.

25:18.484 --> 25:19.383
I'll order it tomorrow.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.352
Great.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.287
Hey, you really need to
go back to the jazz club

25:23.289 --> 25:24.121
and talk to her.

25:24.123 --> 25:24.989
No.

25:24.991 --> 25:25.789
I need a new strategy.

25:59.257 --> 26:02.826
Reminds me of some
of brancusi's work.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.161
Ethan?

26:04.163 --> 26:06.330
Oh, hey Emily.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.431
Good to see you again.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.666
I didn't know you liked art.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.433
Uh, yeah.

26:09.435 --> 26:10.534
Yeah, I work here.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.169
Oh, sweet.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.506
Nice to meet a
fellow art person.

26:15.508 --> 26:19.276
Uh, so how do you mean that
this reminds you of brancusi?

26:19.278 --> 26:25.249
I kind of feel like brancusi had
a much simpler form than this.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.718
No, I'm talking about
his earlier stuff

26:27.720 --> 26:28.953
when he was a little
Wilder, you know?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.255
College years.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.223
I'm not really familiar.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.560
I'm kind of a brancusi expert.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.029
So brancusi is my boy.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.465
Yeah, oh, I love his work.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.401
What's your favorite piece?

26:44.403 --> 26:45.769
A little known gem.

26:45.771 --> 26:50.908
It's a sculpture called
"guy with blender."

26:50.910 --> 26:53.978
And instead of
blending food, he's

26:53.980 --> 27:01.986
blending-- you know, dreams and
hopes and 2/3 cup of reality.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.988
So it's pretty
symbolic and stuff.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.691
You'd kind have to be a big
art lover to appreciate it.

27:10.662 --> 27:13.397
So how have you been?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.898
Uh, great.

27:14.900 --> 27:15.833
And you?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.067
Fantastic.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.570
Yeah, are you
married or anything?

27:19.572 --> 27:21.105
No, no.

27:21.107 --> 27:21.905
Are you?

27:21.907 --> 27:22.973
Oh, no, no, no.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.608
No way.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.777
But I got me a girlfriend, yep.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.679
I've got me one of those.

27:28.681 --> 27:29.613
Well done.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.115
Yeah.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.283
I remember you moving
away during middle school.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.985
Are you back in town now, or?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.253
Yeah.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.187
Yeah, I moved back
about a year ago.

27:37.189 --> 27:37.988
Oh, ok.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.123
Cool.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.424
I missed you.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.359
I mean, we.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.861
As a community.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.095
Yeah.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.998
I really miss being here.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.834
So what are you doing now?

27:50.836 --> 27:54.538
Just here making
brancusi observations.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.839
I mean for a living.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.541
Oh, right.

27:57.543 --> 28:00.678
I'm a freelance consultant.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.046
Oh, cool.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.782
What do you consult on.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.452
I take dysfunctional
systems and I

28:08.454 --> 28:12.790
disassemble them for diagnosis.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.525
Sounds complicated.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.559
Oh, it is.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.327
Trust me.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.197
Well, do you fix them too?

28:20.199 --> 28:21.031
No.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.199
No, not usually.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.536
That's kind of the
next guy's job.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.270
Oh.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.844
How am I going to do this?

28:33.846 --> 28:34.978
Break her up from
her boyfriend?

28:34.980 --> 28:37.181
Convince her of anything.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.550
I'm vacant of all rational
thought when I'm around her.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.318
How am I going to find
something persuasive to say,

28:41.320 --> 28:43.854
or even halfway intelligible?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.889
Maybe you'll get lucky.

28:45.891 --> 28:55.499
Maybe her boyfriend is really
ugly, and-- that's him?

28:55.501 --> 28:56.433
Yep.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.167
Oh.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.273
Good luck.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.274
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.243
What am I supposed to do?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.579
You're the expert.

29:08.581 --> 29:13.050
There's got to be a chip in that
high gloss, heavy duty, premium

29:13.052 --> 29:13.817
quality paint.

29:42.814 --> 29:44.615
Hey, are you waiting for this?

29:44.617 --> 29:46.984
Oh, yeah, I mean-- go
ahead, it's all good.

29:46.986 --> 29:47.785
No, no.

29:47.787 --> 29:48.585
It's cool.

29:48.587 --> 29:49.486
We can just work in.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.320
Oh, ok.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.121
Yeah.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.456
Cool, yeah.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.257
I'm Ethan.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.625
Oh, Brian.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.893
Awesome.

29:55.895 --> 30:00.564
Great to meet such a nice guy.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.132
So are you here to
impress the ladies,

30:02.134 --> 30:04.635
or to look at the ladies?

30:04.637 --> 30:06.837
No, I got a girlfriend.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.605
Yeah, but when has that
stopped anybody before?

30:08.607 --> 30:10.774
Am I right?

30:10.776 --> 30:13.677
No, I'm fully committed, man.

30:13.679 --> 30:17.648
So by fully committed
you mean, what, 60%, 70%?

30:17.650 --> 30:20.017
100%.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.953
So then like, 80% maybe?

30:22.955 --> 30:25.122
So yeah, I've probably
got another five years

30:25.124 --> 30:27.257
or so to pay off my car.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.592
What do you drive?

30:28.594 --> 30:30.994
Got some massive loan
you can't afford?

30:30.996 --> 30:31.962
No, actually.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.463
The car is fully paid for.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.700
I've been saving up since
i was 10, mowing lawns.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.435
That's great.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.838
Really is great.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.039
You watch movies much?

30:42.041 --> 30:43.774
You seem like the
kind of guy who

30:43.776 --> 30:46.810
would waste a whole Saturday
watching mindless television.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.111
No.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.380
Actually, I don't even own a TV.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.616
I spend most of my
Saturdays just helping

30:52.618 --> 30:54.051
out at the soup kitchen.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.285
That's great.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.855
This is the rowing
machine, right?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.790
He's like the offspring
of Taylor swift

30:59.792 --> 31:02.759
and-- I don't know,
Channing Tatum.

31:06.798 --> 31:07.664
What?

31:07.666 --> 31:09.499
He's perfect, ok?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.068
They're the perfect couple.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.136
How am I supposed to
break these two up?

31:40.398 --> 31:41.498
Stop squirming.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.033
I can't breathe.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.935
We are not leaving
here until you have

31:44.937 --> 31:47.070
found yourself a nice girl.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.040
Wayne, did you ask around?

31:50.042 --> 31:51.541
To see if there are
any girls who would

31:51.543 --> 31:53.877
like to dance with Mitchell?

31:53.879 --> 31:56.613
That sounds like
Mitchell's job, honey.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.548
Do you really want to
leave Mitchell's future

31:58.550 --> 32:00.550
in the hands of Mitchell?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.119
Of course not.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.387
Don't you
want him out of the house?

32:03.389 --> 32:04.554
More than anything.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.056
I can hear you.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.357
And I would like to
pick my own girls.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.859
Fine.

32:08.861 --> 32:09.960
Who do you pick?

32:13.298 --> 32:14.364
None of them.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.198
Why?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.034
They're all snooty.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.971
They are refined, like sugar.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.205
But you won't
let me have sugar.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.208
Well, tonight you
are off your diet.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.277
Figuratively.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.947
Now get out there,
pick any one you want.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.515
They're all better than
what you find at college.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.631
Do you want to dance?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.801
Oh, no thank you.

32:50.803 --> 32:51.535
Good.

32:56.107 --> 32:59.943
Yeah, so if we get
married, I would prefer

32:59.945 --> 33:04.915
to have a room for my iguana.

33:04.917 --> 33:05.716
He likes to roam.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.757
I hope our kids get my eyebrows.

33:35.546 --> 33:36.947
Doggy pocket?

33:36.949 --> 33:38.548
What?

33:38.550 --> 33:42.152
I see you're saving
the carrots for later.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.855
No, I have an iguana.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.356
You have an iguana?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.657
What kind?

33:47.659 --> 33:48.992
It's a green iguana.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.794
I have one too.

33:50.796 --> 33:51.561
Oh!

33:51.563 --> 33:52.295
Oh.

34:02.907 --> 34:05.909
So, do you like these parties?

34:05.911 --> 34:07.411
They're torture.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.413
The food, the music.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.585
Is this sugar-free lemonade?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.054
Yeah.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.257
The largest size they
have in the gift shop here

34:20.259 --> 34:22.726
is a size four.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.196
They discourage sugar.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.097
Not completely.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.239
You know there's a fine
for wearing the wrong color

34:36.241 --> 34:38.241
white on a tennis court?

34:38.243 --> 34:42.746
$1,000 per shade.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.414
You see that guy over there?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.916
Yeah.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.585
He's been in therapy since
he broke his nine iron.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.290
Is that guy a vampire?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.091
I mean, really.

34:54.092 --> 34:54.958
Look at him.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.592
He looks like a vampire.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.528
I mean, that or there's too
much chlorine in the pool.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.047
And that's when i
caught my first pikachu.

35:17.049 --> 35:18.949
You're cute.

35:23.654 --> 35:24.721
I love this song.

35:27.925 --> 35:28.959
Should we dance?

35:43.508 --> 35:44.508
We have to go.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.509
You are grounded.
-What?

35:45.511 --> 35:46.510
Why?

35:46.512 --> 35:47.811
Your eyes are sugar dilated.

36:04.795 --> 36:05.662
Mr. Cooper?

36:05.664 --> 36:06.496
Yeah.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.397
Right this way.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.103
He's already saying

36:13.105 --> 36:14.771
that he's in love with her.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.107
And what's your main
problem with the girl?

36:17.109 --> 36:19.142
She's a food server.

36:19.144 --> 36:21.478
He's selling himself short.

36:21.480 --> 36:25.949
Currently, we don't want him
out of the house that badly.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.318
Well, you should
know I don't have

36:28.320 --> 36:31.988
any experience with breaking
up boys from their girlfriends.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.491
It's always been the
other way around.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.059
The job should be easy.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.727
The girl is awful.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.297
She wears an apron.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.299
Polyester.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.135
I like polyester.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.703
I have a meeting.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.205
That's fine.

36:48.207 --> 36:51.074
I think we can handle this
without your scoffing.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.043
It was nice meeting you.

36:53.045 --> 36:53.877
Oh, you too.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.813
Thanks.

36:56.815 --> 36:57.981
He's a record producer?

36:57.983 --> 37:01.184
Yes, with tremendous
connections.

37:01.186 --> 37:04.054
There is no reason Mitchell
should be settling.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.388
Ok, yeah.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.656
I get it.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.258
Mess this up, and
I'll make sure you

37:08.260 --> 37:10.927
never get another job for the
women at the country club.

37:10.929 --> 37:15.832
Or I can recommend you, and
you'll be booked for months.

37:19.837 --> 37:21.871
So do
you write your own songs?

37:21.873 --> 37:22.906
Yeah.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.774
I mean, well, some of the them.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.076
Impressive.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.511
Have you done
anything with them?

37:28.513 --> 37:32.249
Just singing them at the
green lady to about 30 people

37:32.251 --> 37:34.384
a night.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.452
Waiting for that
big break, huh?

37:35.454 --> 37:36.920
Yeah.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.023
Yeah, maybe one day.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.459
I, uh, met your boyfriend.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.593
Brian?

37:43.595 --> 37:44.427
Yep.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.730
How?

37:46.732 --> 37:48.698
We work out together.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.067
He told me he goes to
the club to see you sing.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.369
Yeah, he does.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.070
Great guy.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.473
He sure is.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.541
The best.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.644
I think so.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.078
You know his teeth are capped?

38:02.080 --> 38:05.048
It makes me wonder what
really lies under there.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.951
What?

38:07.953 --> 38:10.754
Nothing, I'm just,
uh-- oh, did somebody

38:10.756 --> 38:13.456
leave their partially digested
set of fireplace pokers here?

38:13.458 --> 38:16.626
Why,
you don't like it?

38:16.628 --> 38:17.761
You do?

38:17.763 --> 38:18.795
Yeah.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.563
You know, the title is perfect.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.733
It's called "love."

38:23.735 --> 38:25.335
"Love?"

38:25.337 --> 38:27.504
Yeah, you don't think
this looks like love?

38:27.506 --> 38:30.073
Well, I mean, if
you're in a relationship

38:30.075 --> 38:32.809
with a garbage man.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.778
Well, I think it looks
exactly like love.

38:34.780 --> 38:42.352
You know, up close it's all so
weird and defective and messy.

38:42.354 --> 38:47.991
But when you take a
step back, as a whole?

38:47.993 --> 38:48.758
It's beautiful.

38:52.463 --> 38:54.030
I'm singing Thursday night.

38:54.032 --> 38:54.764
Would you like to come?

38:57.535 --> 38:59.469
Ethan?

38:59.471 --> 39:02.138
Yes, I'd love to.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.008
Great, you can bring
your girlfriend.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.443
My girlfriend?

39:06.445 --> 39:08.044
Right.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.846
Because I have one of those.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.818
Mitchell, this is Ethan.

39:14.820 --> 39:18.321
I've hired him as
your confidence coach.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.356
Wait, what?

39:19.358 --> 39:20.857
They're very common these days.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.893
Nice to meet you, Mitchell.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.128
I don't need this.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.796
My confidence is fine.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.632
Look, I dressed myself today.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.368
I will arrange for a
wardrobe consultant asap.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.208
Why are you here?

39:38.210 --> 39:41.344
Your mom thinks
that I can help you.

39:41.346 --> 39:42.812
You can't.

39:42.814 --> 39:43.980
I don't need you.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.582
Not now.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.818
Trisha, she makes me
feel good about myself.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.320
She's all I need.

39:50.322 --> 39:53.189
Yes, but is Trisha a
licensed confidenceologist?

39:53.191 --> 39:56.493
I don't care if she's
a licensed witch doctor.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.927
I love her.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.696
That brings up a good point.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.497
How--

40:00.499 --> 40:02.065
whoa, whoa.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.267
My iguana doesn't like you
touching his sweater vest.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.239
My bad.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.175
How well do you
really know Trisha?

40:12.177 --> 40:15.111
Well, I met her in person once.

40:15.113 --> 40:18.114
And we Skype and text a lot.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.216
In fact, we did a double
date just the other day

40:20.218 --> 40:23.286
with our iguanas.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.054
But again, Skype.

40:25.056 --> 40:29.426
So you haven't been
on a date alone.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.760
No.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.730
Then how do you know
what horrific things

40:33.732 --> 40:36.733
have yet to be uncovered?

40:36.735 --> 40:39.569
There are none with Trisha.

40:39.571 --> 40:42.238
But I suppose I should
go out with her.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.306
Mmhm.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.775
Yeah, definitely.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.945
To be honest, it actually
makes me kind of nervous.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.549
So it sounds like you
need some confidence, huh?

40:52.551 --> 40:53.917
Tell you what.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.653
I'll go with you.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.555
Wouldn't that be kind of
weird with the three of us?

40:58.557 --> 41:00.423
I have a girlfriend.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.591
We'll double.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.559
Yes.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.427
Yes!

41:04.429 --> 41:07.063
Ok, so how
about 5:00 on Tuesday?

41:07.065 --> 41:07.997
Yes!

41:07.999 --> 41:09.432
So much yes.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.633
Great.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.602
I'll be here at
4:45 to make sure

41:12.604 --> 41:13.870
that you're not wearing this.

41:16.674 --> 41:20.109
Are we looking
at the same shirt?

41:20.111 --> 41:21.644
Lexie, you got a job.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.680
I need a fake girlfriend
tomorrow night.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.948
Great.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.816
It might be a
little tough, though.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.184
It's Mitchell and Trisha.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.753
They're socially abnormal.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.956
They obviously can't
see traditional flaws.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.991
So you want to try the
bleak future approach?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.626
Yeah, I think
that's the way to go.

41:36.628 --> 41:37.427
Cool.

41:37.429 --> 41:38.661
How much is the job?

41:38.663 --> 41:41.331
Oh, Lexie, this is
the golden ticket.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.131
Really?

41:42.133 --> 41:43.800
Do tell.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.035
My client is loaded, and she
has a lot of loaded friends.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.171
We could be swimming in mega
dough by the end of the year.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.941
Ooh, I've never made
15% of mega dough before.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.610
That's because I pay you 10%.

41:53.612 --> 41:57.146
Yeah, but that was before you
were swimming in mega dough.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.883
I do 90% of the
work, you get 10%.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.951
Accidentally double booked
us on weddings this weekend.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.820
You think you can break one
of the couples up real quick?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.321
Are you gonna pay me?

42:05.323 --> 42:06.823
Do I get an employee discount?

42:06.825 --> 42:07.991
Yeah.

42:07.993 --> 42:08.725
10%.

42:11.795 --> 42:13.329
And for you?

42:13.331 --> 42:17.467
Can I get the chicken
fingers and the French fries

42:17.469 --> 42:20.303
and a glass of milk?

42:20.305 --> 42:21.538
I'm sorry, sir.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.306
That item isn't on
the regular menu.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.307
I know.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.543
I want it off the kids menu.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.678
You're kidding me.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.147
That's exactly what
i was gonna order.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.315
Two, please.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.082
Two.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.084
Ok.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.353
You guys are so compatible.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.421
You think?

42:38.423 --> 42:39.556
Oh, yeah.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.990
Perfect for each other.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.026
But have you discover
the Jigsaw puzzle yet?

42:43.028 --> 42:44.394
The what?

42:44.396 --> 42:46.362
You guys are two pieces
of a Jigsaw puzzle,

42:46.364 --> 42:48.598
and no two pieces of the
puzzle are exactly alike.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.200
But two pieces that are next
to each other align perfectly.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.769
It's like me and Ethan.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.270
We compliment each
other so well,

42:54.272 --> 42:55.905
my strengths are his weaknesses.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.607
And vice versa.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.175
Which is perfect for when we
get married, because we already

42:59.177 --> 43:00.743
know our roles.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.045
Like, I'm the one who's gonna
be decorating the walls.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.746
Because I have no clue.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.415
And he's the one who's gonna
be filling out all the estate

43:05.417 --> 43:06.683
tax regovernance forms.

43:06.685 --> 43:10.353
Because she has no clue.

43:10.355 --> 43:11.955
So if you guys got
married, which one of you

43:11.957 --> 43:13.790
would file the estate
tax regovernance forms?

43:16.727 --> 43:19.529
I don't know what those are.

43:19.531 --> 43:21.531
Neither do I.

43:21.533 --> 43:22.732
That's ok, don't
worry about it.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.601
You just need to
learn a little Latin.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.102
Just a tad.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.805
So which one of
you is good with cooking?

43:28.807 --> 43:32.041
Well, I can make ice.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.911
I have pizza hut on speed dial.

43:34.913 --> 43:36.412
Me too.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.147
Good.

43:38.149 --> 43:39.716
And which one of you know which
fertilizer you use on the lawn

43:39.718 --> 43:41.484
to make it exactly the right
concentration of nitrate

43:41.486 --> 43:43.152
so that your kids don't
poison themselves when they

43:43.154 --> 43:46.623
play in the front yard and die?

43:46.625 --> 43:52.228
Uh, I don't know anything.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.297
I have no idea.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.799
Oh.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.968
I guess--

43:58.970 --> 44:00.303
I guess they could
just stay indoors.

44:04.441 --> 44:06.809
Like taking candy from a baby.

44:06.811 --> 44:09.846
This is gonna be the
easiest split up in history.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.414
Should we give them
more time to worry

44:11.416 --> 44:13.683
about the future of America
if they end up together?

44:13.685 --> 44:15.151
No.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.085
I think they've had
enough time to freak out.

44:21.025 --> 44:23.026
That's so wild.

44:23.028 --> 44:24.627
What's going on?

44:24.629 --> 44:27.096
We just found out the
most incredible thing.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.998
What?

44:29.000 --> 44:32.368
We both love stargazing.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.137
Wow.

44:34.139 --> 44:36.039
Really?

44:36.041 --> 44:38.608
It's like we're
made for each other.

44:38.610 --> 44:40.476
Especially considering
the 0% of people

44:40.478 --> 44:41.444
who hate looking at stars.

44:55.125 --> 45:05.234
Ooh, nights are
long since you went away.

45:05.236 --> 45:12.508
Ooh, nights are
long since you went away.

45:12.510 --> 45:21.317
I think about you
all through the day.

45:21.319 --> 45:35.665
My buddy, my buddy,
nobody quite so true.

45:39.169 --> 45:48.344
Miss your voice, the
touch of your hand.

45:48.346 --> 45:56.753
Just long to know
that you understand.

45:56.755 --> 46:02.725
My buddy, my buddy.

46:04.596 --> 46:06.596
Was she really that
good, or was she

46:06.598 --> 46:08.965
Ethan's Emily version of good?

46:08.967 --> 46:11.701
Everybody loved her, and
she writes her own music.

46:14.538 --> 46:17.640
Does she have
a record deal?

46:17.642 --> 46:18.608
Uh, no.

46:18.610 --> 46:21.244
But that's her dream.

46:21.246 --> 46:23.913
Hey, isn't Mitchell's
dad a record producer?

46:23.915 --> 46:25.248
Yeah.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.550
So why don't you
introduce them?

46:27.552 --> 46:29.285
Doesn't seem appropriate.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.486
What?

46:30.488 --> 46:31.988
You afraid you
might not like her?

46:31.990 --> 46:35.158
Psh, impossible.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.626
You're afraid he
will, and then she'll

46:36.628 --> 46:38.060
get successful and leave.

46:38.062 --> 46:38.828
No.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.566
Are you gonna go after
her when you break her up?

46:43.568 --> 46:45.635
That's probably
not gonna happen.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.136
They're way too
good for each other.

46:50.307 --> 46:52.008
Lexie, we got another job.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.276
What is it?

46:53.278 --> 46:54.677
A sailboat day with
Brian and Emily.

46:54.679 --> 46:56.112
Are you in?

46:56.114 --> 46:57.180
I want a raise.

46:57.182 --> 46:58.347
How much?

46:58.349 --> 46:59.582
30%.

46:59.584 --> 47:00.449
What?

47:00.451 --> 47:01.517
That's crazy.

47:01.519 --> 47:03.085
I need more cash.

47:03.087 --> 47:04.754
I want to start my own business.

47:04.756 --> 47:06.656
By bankrupting mine?

47:06.658 --> 47:08.357
That's what family's for.

47:08.359 --> 47:09.692
Come on, Ethan.

47:09.694 --> 47:11.360
Pay the woman what she's worth.

47:11.362 --> 47:13.696
Why do you even care?

47:13.698 --> 47:16.699
I've always been a champion
for the underemployed.

47:16.701 --> 47:18.634
You once tipped a
pizza delivery guy

47:18.636 --> 47:20.670
in sunflower seeds.

47:20.672 --> 47:22.471
They're very tasty.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.106
Lexie, you're just
going to have to patient.

47:24.108 --> 47:25.708
The money is coming, ok?

47:25.710 --> 47:28.144
What, because of the golden
ticket country club lady?

47:28.146 --> 47:30.713
Last time I checked, her two
lovebirds were holding hands

47:30.715 --> 47:31.881
and watching stars.

47:31.883 --> 47:33.883
It's not looking
promising, Ethan.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.117
I'll get them.

47:35.119 --> 47:36.452
I always have.

47:36.454 --> 47:39.455
Yeah, well, just
in case, I want 30%.

47:39.457 --> 47:41.190
You don't think I can train
any girl off the streets

47:41.192 --> 47:42.959
to do what you do?

47:42.961 --> 47:43.726
30%.

47:47.364 --> 47:49.131
I don't need you as
badly as you think.

47:50.802 --> 47:52.168
I really need her.

47:52.170 --> 47:53.669
Yeah.

47:53.671 --> 47:55.671
How are you gonna find a
girlfriend in seven hours?

48:01.712 --> 48:02.478
Ethan.

48:13.190 --> 48:15.858
So, how did you guys meet?

48:15.860 --> 48:18.895
Do you want to tell it, or--?

48:18.897 --> 48:20.596
Sure, yeah.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.265
We were in the park,
and I was walking--

48:22.267 --> 48:23.833
no, no.

48:23.835 --> 48:26.769
No, she's talking about
the first time that we met.

48:26.771 --> 48:28.371
Ok, well-- you know what?

48:28.373 --> 48:29.705
Why don't you just tell it?

48:29.707 --> 48:32.275
Ok, so we were both 7.

48:32.277 --> 48:35.845
And I lived in another town, but
our schools went on field trips

48:35.847 --> 48:37.413
with each other.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.882
We were at the children's
museum in the planetarium,

48:39.884 --> 48:42.084
and we all have these reclining
seats so we could lay back

48:42.086 --> 48:43.586
and look at the stars.

48:43.588 --> 48:46.555
But my seat didn't work,
and so Ethan-- who was two

48:46.557 --> 48:48.624
rows back-- he came up to me.

48:48.626 --> 48:51.928
And he had this cute
little red baseball tee on.

48:51.930 --> 48:56.632
And I was wearing--
what was I wearing?

48:56.634 --> 48:58.734
Um, that um, uh--

48:58.736 --> 49:00.469
it was a cute black dress.

49:00.471 --> 49:02.071
Yes, a cute black dress.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.639
Wait, or was it yellow?

49:03.641 --> 49:04.874
It was yellow.

49:04.876 --> 49:05.808
Right.

49:05.810 --> 49:07.944
Kind of a yellowish black.

49:07.946 --> 49:09.845
You don't-- you don't
remember this, do you.

49:11.148 --> 49:12.048
Sorry.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.983
No, i-- I, uh.

49:13.985 --> 49:18.921
Anyway, Ethan gave
me his seat, and he

49:18.923 --> 49:20.589
said it was because the
stars made him nauseous.

49:20.591 --> 49:23.159
But I know he was
just being nice.

49:23.161 --> 49:26.429
I mean, what
seven-year-old does that?

49:26.431 --> 49:29.498
Oh, how sweet you guys.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.600
And I should have known there
was something special about him

49:31.602 --> 49:32.935
then.

49:32.937 --> 49:34.437
But you know, I kind
of forgot about him,

49:34.439 --> 49:36.405
and then we didn't talk.

49:36.407 --> 49:39.442
And then we met
back up at the park.

49:39.444 --> 49:41.644
With our dogs.

49:41.646 --> 49:44.313
You know, and sometimes
you're lucky enough

49:44.315 --> 49:47.049
to get a second chance
with the right one.

49:49.753 --> 49:52.488
A shooting star!

49:52.490 --> 49:55.191
Usually shooting stars
are gone in half a second.

49:55.193 --> 49:59.261
I bet it's just a
really fast plane.

49:59.263 --> 50:02.365
Really fast plane
are so romantic.

50:02.367 --> 50:05.634
Uh, whatcha doing there?

50:05.636 --> 50:07.937
This is my angle.

50:07.939 --> 50:09.505
Lay back this way.
-Oh.

50:09.507 --> 50:10.373
Ok.

50:10.375 --> 50:11.173
Got it.

50:11.175 --> 50:12.808
So good.

50:12.810 --> 50:14.276
You guys.

50:14.278 --> 50:17.446
So how did you guys meet?

50:17.448 --> 50:18.948
Ok, ok.

50:18.950 --> 50:21.717
We were at the gym and
she didn't have a spotter,

50:21.719 --> 50:24.453
so I just came over
and-- thank goodness

50:24.455 --> 50:27.289
she was being irresponsible.

50:27.291 --> 50:29.959
You know, don't you love
how that stuff just happens?

50:29.961 --> 50:35.898
When I was looking for a
seatmate, I found a soulmate.

50:35.900 --> 50:36.799
Oh.

50:36.801 --> 50:38.334
Wow.

50:38.336 --> 50:40.736
And now I love him
more than my own life.

50:40.738 --> 50:42.705
Oh, don't say that.

50:42.707 --> 50:45.307
No, I do.

50:45.309 --> 50:48.511
Well, people say it, but
is it ever really true?

50:48.513 --> 50:50.312
You doubt my love for you?

50:50.314 --> 50:51.814
No, absolutely not.

50:51.816 --> 50:53.249
That is the one
thing I'm certain of.

50:53.251 --> 50:54.750
No, nuh uh.

50:54.752 --> 50:58.020
Because I would throw
myself overboard for you.

50:58.022 --> 50:58.921
Yeah, if I was drowning.

50:58.923 --> 51:00.356
But I don't--
-no, no.

51:00.358 --> 51:01.690
I'm not talking about
if you were drowning.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.259
I'm talking about
right here, right now.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.428
I would throw myself overboard
for absolutely no reason

51:05.430 --> 51:07.263
to prove to you that I love you.

51:07.265 --> 51:09.198
How would that prove
that you love me?

51:09.200 --> 51:10.399
-You don't believe me?
-Oh, hey.

51:10.401 --> 51:11.267
Be careful.

51:11.269 --> 51:12.535
No, I know you Ethan.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.503
You're a man of
action, not words.

51:14.505 --> 51:15.671
I love words.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.073
I don't even know
what that means.

51:17.075 --> 51:18.274
No, you want me to show
you how much I love you?

51:18.276 --> 51:19.008
Veronica, please.
Sit down.

51:19.010 --> 51:19.708
Please, please.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.243
No!

51:21.245 --> 51:22.711
Ethan, you need your own
epiphany, just like the one

51:22.713 --> 51:23.879
I had at the children's museum!

51:23.881 --> 51:24.947
What?!
No!

51:24.949 --> 51:25.748
No!

51:31.088 --> 51:33.189
Jump in after me, Ethan!

51:33.191 --> 51:34.056
Really?

51:34.058 --> 51:37.226
Prove to me your love!

51:37.228 --> 51:39.361
I would normally,
but it's cold.

51:39.363 --> 51:40.696
I have a life saver.

51:40.698 --> 51:41.530
Hey, catch.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.076
I've got dry
clothes in the car.

51:54.078 --> 51:56.645
I'm gonna go.

51:56.647 --> 51:57.379
Ok.

52:01.585 --> 52:03.319
So.

52:03.321 --> 52:05.921
Yeah, sorry about that.

52:05.923 --> 52:08.457
She gets a little
emotional at times.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.093
A little?

52:11.095 --> 52:12.328
But I still like her.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.830
I mean, she really loves you.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.133
I guess.

52:17.135 --> 52:20.402
You know, it must be nice.

52:20.404 --> 52:22.271
What?

52:22.273 --> 52:26.408
To have that kind of
passion for someone.

52:35.318 --> 52:36.919
So I had a dream about
Trisha last night.

52:36.921 --> 52:37.686
Yeah?

52:37.688 --> 52:39.021
What about?

52:39.023 --> 52:40.322
She came to my house
in a shower curtain.

52:40.324 --> 52:43.425
Why?

52:43.427 --> 52:47.029
I don't know, but
i woke up smiling.

52:47.031 --> 52:48.330
I'm in love with her.

52:48.332 --> 52:49.999
I am in love with her.

52:50.001 --> 52:53.302
Every molecule in my body
right now is in love with her.

52:53.304 --> 52:57.039
She deserves the best, the best.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.440
And you think that's you?

52:58.442 --> 52:59.875
I mean, you think you're
the best she can do?

53:03.046 --> 53:04.280
Wow.

53:04.282 --> 53:05.514
Wow.

53:05.516 --> 53:06.482
What?

53:06.484 --> 53:07.650
No.

53:07.652 --> 53:08.450
No, I'm sorry.

53:08.452 --> 53:09.952
I didn't--

53:09.954 --> 53:12.955
that's an odd thing for
a confidence coach to say.

53:12.957 --> 53:14.323
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

53:14.325 --> 53:15.124
That was lousy.

53:15.126 --> 53:17.459
I'm sorry.

53:17.461 --> 53:18.394
But you're right.

53:18.396 --> 53:19.895
No, Mitchell, no I'm not.

53:19.897 --> 53:21.797
She deserves better.

53:21.799 --> 53:22.665
No, she doesn't.

53:22.667 --> 53:24.166
No.

53:24.168 --> 53:26.068
I mean, she could probably
get somebody real good.

53:26.070 --> 53:27.469
Hello?

53:27.471 --> 53:28.837
I'm a loser.

53:28.839 --> 53:29.638
Emily?

53:29.640 --> 53:32.141
What's the matter?

53:32.143 --> 53:34.577
It's been kind of obvious
for the past couple months

53:34.579 --> 53:37.246
now-- obvious to me, not him.

53:37.248 --> 53:40.015
Just completely blindsided him.

53:40.017 --> 53:43.052
I mean, no one had ever
broken up with him before.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.820
And why would anyone
ever break up with him?

53:44.822 --> 53:46.322
He's this great guy.

53:46.324 --> 53:52.161
He's like-- he's kind and
generous, he's handsome.

53:52.163 --> 53:55.931
He was perfect, just
not perfect for me.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.270
It's a whole new ball game.

54:01.272 --> 54:04.940
Why would she call me after
breaking up with her boyfriend?

54:04.942 --> 54:07.509
It's a whole new ball game.

54:07.511 --> 54:08.844
I just met her a few weeks ago.

54:08.846 --> 54:10.512
Why call me?

54:10.514 --> 54:14.016
She wanted to tell you
it's a whole new ball game.

54:14.018 --> 54:15.417
Come on, man.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.119
The laundry basket is
less than 10 feet away.

54:17.121 --> 54:18.954
Beast?

54:18.956 --> 54:21.223
You-- you taught him
how to do laundry?

54:21.225 --> 54:22.124
Apparently not.

54:25.528 --> 54:29.098
So should I ask her out,
maybe just as friends?

54:29.100 --> 54:30.232
You have no choice.

54:30.234 --> 54:32.067
You have to ask her as friends.

54:32.069 --> 54:34.436
Right, because it's too soon.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.537
I have to give her time.

54:35.539 --> 54:37.740
It's not that easy.

54:37.742 --> 54:39.575
You got a girlfriend.

54:39.577 --> 54:42.544
Yeah, i
have a girlfriend.

54:42.546 --> 54:47.149
So how long do I have to wait
before I can break up with her?

54:47.151 --> 54:49.551
Well, you wait too long, and
then Emily finds someone else.

54:49.553 --> 54:52.288
And not waiting long enough
will seem opportunistic.

54:52.290 --> 54:53.822
Right.

54:53.824 --> 54:55.491
So you got to make sure
you're still in Emily's life

54:55.493 --> 54:58.594
without making it seem like
you're cheating on Veronica.

54:58.596 --> 55:00.796
Right.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.831
I'll go to the jazz club.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.466
She needs support.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.435
Brian always used to be the
one who watched her sing.

55:06.437 --> 55:08.637
Now it could be me.

55:08.639 --> 55:11.840
I'll just show up as a friend.

55:11.842 --> 55:14.176
That's a good strategy.

55:14.178 --> 55:16.912
Hey, was Lexie flirting
with me the other day?

55:16.914 --> 55:19.315
Stay away from my sister.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.983
Why?

55:20.985 --> 55:25.120
A list that long would
use up all my printer ink.

55:25.122 --> 55:26.789
Miss atkins, hey.

55:26.791 --> 55:28.357
Well done, Ethan.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.826
You worked faster than
i thought you could.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.528
Uh, you know what, miss atkins?

55:32.530 --> 55:33.962
I don't deserve this.

55:33.964 --> 55:35.931
She broke up with Brian
without my help at all.

55:35.933 --> 55:37.032
Nonsense.

55:37.034 --> 55:39.368
Whatever you did, it worked.

55:39.370 --> 55:41.637
It's part of our agreement.

55:41.639 --> 55:45.441
I, uh-- I can't accept this.

55:45.443 --> 55:46.542
Sorry.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.811
Suit yourself.

55:48.813 --> 55:50.813
Did you mention Thomas?

55:50.815 --> 55:51.980
Thomas?

55:51.982 --> 55:53.215
The guy I want her to marry.

55:53.217 --> 55:54.016
No.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.117
No?

55:55.119 --> 55:56.118
That's ok.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.486
I'll take it from here.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.621
Now that Brian's gone,
it should be easy.

56:09.999 --> 56:11.133
I'll wait.

56:11.135 --> 56:14.837
But not too long.

56:14.839 --> 56:20.809
I know it's true,
there's no one, dear, but you.

56:20.811 --> 56:29.718
You're whispering why you'll
never leave me, whispering

56:29.720 --> 56:34.690
why you'll never grieve me.

56:34.692 --> 56:48.070
Whispering, say that you believe
me, whispering that I love you.

56:56.212 --> 56:57.212
Hey.

56:57.214 --> 56:58.947
I got to be honest with you.

56:58.949 --> 57:02.384
I was never a big fan of jazz,
but you're changing my mind.

57:02.386 --> 57:03.585
So I converted you.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.853
Yeah.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.522
I'm seriously
considering renouncing

57:06.524 --> 57:07.589
my devotion to polka.

57:10.693 --> 57:13.061
So why were you here?

57:13.063 --> 57:14.229
When?

57:14.231 --> 57:15.597
The night that we met.

57:15.599 --> 57:17.099
If you don't like
jazz, then why were

57:17.101 --> 57:18.367
you in a jazz club by yourself?

57:22.605 --> 57:27.075
I was outside walking on
my way to the drugstore,

57:27.077 --> 57:29.745
and I heard you singing.

57:29.747 --> 57:32.414
I just, uh-- had to come
in and figure out where

57:32.416 --> 57:34.583
that sound was coming from.

57:34.585 --> 57:39.888
Lo and behold, it was
coming from there.

57:39.890 --> 57:43.058
Yeah, you know, i
lip sync to my songs.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.460
No you don't.

57:44.462 --> 57:45.994
You almost bought it.

57:45.996 --> 57:46.728
Not even close.

57:49.432 --> 57:52.468
So me and Brian were supposed
to go to the fair tomorrow,

57:52.470 --> 57:56.605
and that's obviously
not happening.

57:56.607 --> 58:00.676
So do you wanna hang out?

58:00.678 --> 58:01.410
Sure.

58:06.416 --> 58:07.916
Where are we going?

58:07.918 --> 58:08.684
You'll see.

58:08.686 --> 58:10.018
Ok.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.920
Well, before we start,
let's go in here.

58:28.204 --> 58:30.506
My condolences on the breakup.

58:30.508 --> 58:32.875
Oh, wow, that's very sweet.

58:32.877 --> 58:34.476
Thank you.

58:34.478 --> 58:37.779
But what am I supposed
to do with this?

58:37.781 --> 58:39.047
What?

58:39.049 --> 58:40.716
I mean, we're going
to be out all day.

58:40.718 --> 58:43.852
Don't you think it'll probably
be dead before I get home?

58:43.854 --> 58:45.320
Well, i--

58:45.322 --> 58:47.456
at least get me a silk flower.

58:47.458 --> 58:49.791
You know, I like
those better anyway.

58:49.793 --> 58:50.859
Really?

58:50.861 --> 58:52.027
Why?

58:52.029 --> 58:53.729
Because you'll
always have them.

58:53.731 --> 58:56.198
Like if you put it in a vase
and then you take a vacation,

58:56.200 --> 58:57.799
when you get back, still there.

58:57.801 --> 59:00.235
Charming as ever.

59:00.237 --> 59:03.205
But real flowers
are so perfect.

59:03.207 --> 59:06.041
Yeah, but in a month,
you'll have nothing.

59:06.043 --> 59:11.713
Look, just save your money,
and buy me a gas card.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.850
Or I could just buy
you a fake flower.

59:14.852 --> 59:18.186
Silk flower.

59:18.188 --> 59:22.491
Silk, excuse me.

59:22.493 --> 59:25.327
So you really have
never been here before?

59:25.329 --> 59:26.395
Nope.

59:26.397 --> 59:28.096
But I drive past
it all the time.

59:28.098 --> 59:30.699
I've always wondered what kind
of person shops for records.

59:30.701 --> 59:32.768
Psh, well, now
you know it's you.

59:32.770 --> 59:36.271
I never would have guessed it.

59:36.273 --> 59:38.240
Did you know the
count basie met

59:38.242 --> 59:41.343
his future wife Catherine
three times before they

59:41.345 --> 59:43.111
even spoke to each other?

59:43.113 --> 59:45.013
If that didn't say
count basie, then

59:45.015 --> 59:46.248
I wouldn't even know who it is.

59:46.250 --> 59:48.850
So I'm going to say no.

59:48.852 --> 59:51.954
Well, when they finally did get
a chance to talk for a while,

59:51.956 --> 59:55.924
he ended the conversation
with, one of these days,

59:55.926 --> 59:57.526
I'm going to make you my wife.

59:57.528 --> 01:00:01.930
And then seven
years later, he did.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:04.566
It's just kind of
amazing how he always

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:06.101
just knew what he
wanted and never

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.536
took his eyes off the prize.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.975
Seven years, phew.

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:15.711
So why jazz?

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.912
I don't know.

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.747
With jazz, there's
just this honesty

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:22.618
that you don't get with other
music, maybe except classical.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:27.055
But jazz doesn't shy
away from the hard stuff,

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:31.059
but it makes you feel
better about the sad stuff.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.762
So do you have sad stuff?

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:34.563
Of course.

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:37.065
Doesn't everyone?

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:40.702
Lost loves, unfulfilled
dreams, emptiness.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.814
So why'd you move back here?

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.449
My dad died.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.318
Work accident.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.820
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.956
It's a small community.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:06.128
Yeah, we have relatives
here, so we came back.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:09.965
I'm sorry about your dad,
but I'm glad you're back.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:10.832
Yeah.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.167
Yeah, me too.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.469
Feels like home.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:17.539
You know, I had a crush
on you when I was little.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.840
Yeah?

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:19.775
Me?

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.143
Yep.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:24.846
Yeah, just a teeny one--
microscopic, really.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.482
I remember you being in
the school spelling bee.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:29.351
Mm, right.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.152
Fifth grade.

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.120
Mmhm, yep.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.490
And I was rooting for you, but
it seemed like the moderator

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:37.225
was against you the whole time.

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:38.960
You got all the hard words.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:39.795
Did I?

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:40.662
Yeah.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:42.531
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:45.133
And then you went up against
Jeremy monchak in the finals,

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.869
and I so wanted to
beat Jeremy monchak.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.906
It was tense, because he
got the word "legislature,"

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:53.308
and you got the
word "picturesque."

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:56.845
And then he got "deceitful,"
but he missed it.

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:59.147
And then you got the
word "auspicious,"

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.016
and you spelled it right.

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:02.217
I nearly stood up and screamed.

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:10.659
You remember the words
in the spelling bee?

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:18.066
Uh, it's strange what
you can recall, huh?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.701
Yeah.

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:23.105
And that crush you had on
me, how long did that last?

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:32.781
Uh, it started
when I was about 8.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:36.284
And it lasted until
i was-- I don't know.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.018
24?

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.022
That's about the timeframe.

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.765
I'm just going
to grab my jacket.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:50.565
I'll be two seconds.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:51.299
Ok.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.919
Yeah, sorry
about the mess.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.420
I've just been really busy.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.322
Haven't exactly had a
chance to clean yet.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.428
No problem.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:24.599
It's kind of like
its own art gallery,

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:27.302
if art was all made up of trash.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.241
So she's a slob.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.110
Her apartment looks like
it's inhabited by six

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:37.078
five-year-olds and a goat.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.313
Thorn on the rose.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.347
It was all I could think about.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:41.850
A snag on the sweater vest.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.185
What am I gonna do?

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:44.519
What's the problem?

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:46.121
Do you not get it?

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:48.356
All my life, I've dreamed
of myself with this girl.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.826
So she's a little messy.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:52.594
You're a perfect match.

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.796
You don't pay the electric bill,
and you'll never see the mess.

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:59.601
You know, it's just one thing.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.169
You know,
i don't know you

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.038
didn't want to come to my
apartment for movie night.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.506
Oh, no reason.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:12.314
This car is so fun.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:16.551
What movie did you pick?

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.019
Movies.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.121
You're going to love
them though, my favorite.

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:21.890
All five "twilight" movies.

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:23.391
Woo!

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.295
Oh, yeah.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.864
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:30.365
Can you just give me more ice?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.133
Thank you.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.002
I usually root for Cambodia in
the Olympics because you know,

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.704
they have the cutest flag.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:42.711
It was so painful.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.679
It doesn't sound that bad.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:45.680
Weren't you listening?

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:47.249
Yes.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:49.017
Did you hear the
part about how she

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:51.486
licks her ice can come from the
top down, never from the side?

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:52.988
Do you know how risky that is?

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.924
Oh my word, you have got
to stop with these lists.

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:57.993
They're useless.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:00.662
They're a visual
representation of my misery.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:02.063
Forget this.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.266
You've wanted this girl
since the third grade.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.567
I didn't really know her.

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:07.002
Sure you did.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.436
Not the details.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.838
Ok, but of all the
things you believed

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.373
about her in the third
grade, how many of them

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:12.173
turned out to be true?

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.280
She's smart, talented, sweet.

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:19.514
She can make
friends with anyone.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.616
She's fun.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.251
She has a big heart.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:28.056
She has the greatest laugh ever.

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:30.525
She's beautiful.

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:31.393
Exactly.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:33.128
So you need a new list.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.366
This is all that matters, Ethan.

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:47.876
So you really
like fast food, huh?

01:05:47.878 --> 01:05:49.477
I love it.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.046
If I could, I'd live off of
taco bell and burger king.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:51.813
Wouldn't you?

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.581
Come on.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:55.650
I might throw something in with
some vitamins here and there.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.922
Thanks for hanging
out with me lately.

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:02.991
Yeah, it's been great.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:06.061
Yeah, it's been really nice
having company, you know?

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.410
Look, I licked a leprechaun.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:28.183
What?

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:29.684
I don't know.

01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:31.586
A kid in third grade came
up to me and said that,

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:33.755
and I always thought
it was funny.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.665
This isn't right.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:44.499
What?

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.001
Why?

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.036
You have a girlfriend.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:48.837
Exactly.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.272
It's wrong.

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:53.675
And-- and I can't
do this to Veronica.

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.784
Hello?

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:04.452
What?

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.320
Ok.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:08.690
Ok, I'll be right there.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.892
Hey, uh, a friend
of mine needs help.

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:13.361
Do you want to come?

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.130
Yeah, what does
she need help with?

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.298
I don't know, but she's crying.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.800
You're good at this.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.235
Come on, let's go.

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:29.677
Ok, tell me what happened.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:34.315
He said something stupid about
how he doesn't deserve me.

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.584
That doesn't
make any sense.

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:38.353
Of course it doesn't
make any sense.

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.388
It's a lie.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.725
Obviously, he found
some other girl.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.061
Do you really think that?

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:47.695
A boy like Mitchell
doesn't stay

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:50.765
on the market for very long.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.500
You know Mitchell.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.436
He's the best, right?

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:56.938
You guys know each other?

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.909
Yeah, Mitchell and I go back.

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.010
Did you see this coming?

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:09.250
I should've known
it was too good to be true.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.619
His feelings for me?

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.954
It was a fantasy.

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.723
A fake.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:18.193
A love like that only
exists in the stars.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.435
Have you dressed
yourself for today?

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.169
No.

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:34.242
Do you even have
any clean clothes?

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.109
I don't really need any.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.578
I'm not going anywhere.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:41.416
Brian isn't worth going
into a tailspin over.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.585
It's not Brian.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:47.388
Oh, it's not?

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:48.723
No.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:49.957
Good.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.961
Then you're ready to move on.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.395
Sort of.

01:08:55.398 --> 01:08:58.099
We still going to
Jenny's engagement party?

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:03.104
I mean, it's at the
art gallery, so.

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:04.272
Good.

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:05.840
I'll introduce you
to some people.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:09.477
I don't know.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.645
Thomas is going to be there.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.314
I am not interested.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:17.252
Honey, it's time.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:20.488
You need to find someone new.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.221
For me?

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:35.837
Ethan?

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.542
This just came for you.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.709
Thanks.

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:44.679
And this just came for you.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:50.051
Yes it did, yes it did.

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:51.519
Good boy.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.220
Hello.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.221
Rrr.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.690
Who's a good doggy?

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:02.564
What's the matter with you?

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:04.199
I'm in love.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:07.335
Me too, me too.

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.370
With a person.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:12.207
I think I might actually
have a chance with Emily.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.575
Cool.

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.210
That's kind of a dream
come true, isn't it?

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.378
Yeah, I know.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.249
For the first time ever,
I'm starting to doubt her.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.850
Well, of course you are.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.520
This is the first time it
hasn't been just a fantasy.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:27.989
But if you're in love,
what are you waiting for?

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:29.324
You can't love to
come fall in your lap.

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:31.826
You have to go get it.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:33.895
Look, I've got to go.

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.331
Velma's dragging me to her
cousin's birthday party.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.366
She wants to show off
her new face waxing.

01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:39.734
She barely knows the girl.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.003
By the way, she looks
like a glazed donut.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:43.404
Ok.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:46.074
Hey, Tully?

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:48.076
How did you guys get
together, anyway?

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.844
You have nothing
in common and all

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:51.512
you do is complain about her.

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:53.681
I'm not complaining about her.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:55.950
The weird stuff is
what makes velma velma.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:57.452
And yeah, she's got
a lot of quirks,

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:58.920
but that's all canceled
out by the fact

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.923
that she is the
coolest woman I know.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:05.627
True love bleaches
out the blemishes.

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:07.195
That could be a hallmark card.

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:07.996
I'm going to send that in.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.041
Sam, I need you to
do something for me.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.409
Ok.

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:22.810
There's a party at the
art gallery tonight.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:24.145
Lexie did the flowers
for it, and she told me

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.213
that Emily is gonna be there.

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:26.914
All right.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:28.883
I want you to go there and tell
me how she looks-- you know,

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.251
her mood and stuff like that.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:32.920
That sounds like
a weird assignment.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.422
I'm gonna talk to
her tonight, Sam.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.224
And I just need to know
she's ready for it.

01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:36.991
Oh, Ethan.

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.726
She'll be ready.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:39.594
Don't do anything stupid.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:42.463
I'll be there in a bit.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.202
We need to talk.

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.339
Ok.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:14.028
Let me see the ring.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.029
Congratulations.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:15.997
Thank you.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:51.866
Hello, Thomas.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:52.667
Hello,

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:53.568
Mrs. atkins.

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.402
Emily.

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.370
Nice to see you.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.844
I'm really sorry.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.579
I never meant to fall
for her, it just--

01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:05.413
what was the problem?

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.084
Was it because I didn't
move fast enough?

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.352
Because I didn't kiss you first?

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:12.153
No, no, no.

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:13.688
No, not at all.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.256
Well, I'm never gonna
find anyone as good as you.

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.591
Not true.

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:17.992
There are plenty of
good guys out there,

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:22.397
and you've got qualities
to attract them.

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:23.765
Like what?

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:27.001
Well, um, you're,
uh, persistent.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.603
And you're easy
to hang out with.

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:30.705
Really pretty, of course.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:35.209
Some guy is gonna wanna eat
that kiss right off your face.

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:38.179
Um, just not this guy.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.950
Out.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:43.751
Ok.

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:30.665
Hi.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:34.168
Oh, Emily, you have
something in your teeth.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.636
Just use the mirror in my purse.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.382
Emily.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.050
I have to talk to you.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.452
I have to talk to you.

01:15:24.454 --> 01:15:27.388
Well, let me go first.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.356
What is she doing?

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:40.334
Excuse me.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:42.403
I just need your attention
for a couple moments.

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:50.244
I just want to congratulate
the happy couple.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.079
Congratulations.

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:56.751
You know, what a perfect night--
two people in love deciding

01:15:56.753 --> 01:16:00.221
to be together forever.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:03.357
Is there anyone here
who would disagree

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:06.861
that that's not the most
perfect thing in all of life?

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.996
You know what?

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:14.235
I do know someone here who
would disagree with that.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:16.671
Ethan Cooper.

01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:19.273
Can I just take a
few moments to say

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.776
a couple things about Ethan?

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.210
No, no, no.

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:27.348
Wait, this-- this pertains
to you, I promise.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.951
I know everything there is
to know about Ethan Cooper.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:34.221
I've been faithfully stalking
him for six months now.

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:36.357
And tonight, it all
becomes worth it,

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:40.595
because I can read you some
excerpts from my journal.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.934
Ok, may 12th.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.136
"Ethan was hired to
break up Ginny dotson

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:50.438
from her boyfriend, Mike.

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:59.213
May 31st, Ginny dotson
broke up with Mike today."

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:02.583
He does this all the time.

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:06.153
This is what Ethan
Cooper does for a living.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:08.489
He's a matchbreaker.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:11.459
Mothers and fathers
hire Ethan to break up

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:13.060
their children with
boyfriends and girlfriends

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:13.961
that they don't like.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:21.435
"June 18th, Ethan was hard
to break Mitchell tilten up

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:23.304
with his girlfriend, Trisha."

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:26.273
See, he does this all the time.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.676
Emily, that's what
he's doing with you.

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.579
And he used me to help.

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:34.181
And the worst part
is I knew what

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:37.418
he was doing the whole time.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.124
I knew that he just using me to
help break up Emily and Brian,

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:49.597
but I convinced myself
that he cared about me.

01:17:49.599 --> 01:17:53.834
Not because I had
any evidence of that,

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.403
I just thought you
were a better man.

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.341
I've got more.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.115
Uh, "August 18th.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:16.057
Ethan worse boxers
with ducks on them."

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.458
Ok, I'm done.

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.100
I don't love you.

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.231
Those were my boxers.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:21.422
Oh, when I see you
standing in the shadows,

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:28.763
I wonder why you hide
your pretty face away.

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:36.203
When I hear you
calling out my name,

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:42.042
you know I do it all to
make things right for you.

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:49.250
And when I feel you
shining like you shine,

01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:55.256
that's when I know where
I'm supposed to be when

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:57.391
you're standing by my side.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.243
Ok, you can do this.

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.579
You've done apologies before.

01:20:18.581 --> 01:20:20.481
You've just got to go say, hey.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.016
It's really easy.

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:22.983
This is fine.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:32.827
Dagnabbit.

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:42.203
I, uh-- I just wanted to come
by and say how sorry I am.

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:43.671
I was an idiot, and I know--

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:47.341
chapter closed.

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:56.550
Emily.

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.988
I don't want to see you.

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.356
I'm sorry.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.959
I can't believe
you would do that.

01:21:04.961 --> 01:21:06.327
It was a mistake.

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:08.229
I can live my own life.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:09.663
I know.

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:10.998
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I don't want your apology.

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:15.369
I didn't come here
for your forgiveness.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.071
I'm hoping for
that at some point,

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:20.407
but I realize it's not
going to happen right now.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:21.876
Then why are you here?

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:24.178
I have to tell you something.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.547
What?

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.983
He didn't take the money.

01:21:28.985 --> 01:21:32.219
Ethan, before you found out
what he did for a living,

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.388
he refused the check.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:37.224
He actually seems
like a fine young man.

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:44.431
For what it's worth, he
didn't take the money.

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:17.131
I need to talk to Mitchell.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:18.532
We're eating dinner right now.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:20.267
Yeah, well, it
really can't wait.

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:27.274
Sorry to interrupt your dinner,
but I need to borrow Mitchell.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.376
What?

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:31.645
I can't accept this.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:33.147
What do you mean?

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:34.615
I'm closing my business.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:36.016
Come with me.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:44.391
Oh, there's a girl that sings
at the green lady lounge,

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:45.893
and she'll be there tonight.

01:22:45.895 --> 01:22:48.562
Here name is Emily atkins,
and you have to see her.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:49.463
She's fantastic.

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:55.402
You're missing out
on a lot of money.

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:56.170
I know.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:57.571
Have a nice dinner.

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:55.195
After you get what
you want, you don't want it.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:24:02.336
If I gave you the moon,
you'd grow tired of it soon.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:06.206
You're like a baby.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:10.911
You want what you
want when you want it.

01:24:10.913 --> 01:24:13.847
Ok, so how did it happen?

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:18.685
Ethan went into his
house and dragged him out.

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:19.686
To get you back together?

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:20.654
Yeah.

01:24:20.656 --> 01:24:23.624
Mitchell's mom was so mad.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:09.736
You're whispering
why you'll never leave me.

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:15.709
Whispering why you'll
never grieve me,

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:22.649
whispering, say that
you'll believe me.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:29.123
Whispering that I love you.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:42.970
Looking for a job?

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.440
Yep.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:51.278
But it appears that my skill
set is a bit, um, niche.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.646
Hmm.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.348
I bet.

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:58.118
You know, a record producer
came to the lounge last night.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.419
Really?

01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:01.522
Did you talk to him?

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:04.324
He wants a demo.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.527
That's great.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:10.264
I guess I have to make a demo.

01:26:10.266 --> 01:26:13.600
Yeah, that's fantastic.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:14.635
Yeah.

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:17.037
Yeah, it's-- I'm really excited.

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:18.372
You deserve it.

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:25.279
Getting Trisha and Mitchell
back together, that cost you.

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:28.715
Didn't it?

01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:30.851
The things you do for love.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:31.585
Yeah.

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.823
Why are you sitting here?

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:42.062
I'm a jerk, a schemer, a
professional heartbreaker.

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:45.065
An idiot.

01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:48.035
Yeah, that too.

01:26:48.037 --> 01:26:49.803
So why would you
sit down with me?

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.942
Because love sees
past the imperfections.

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.411
Sam?

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:32.379
You ok?

01:27:32.381 --> 01:27:33.113
Shh.

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:44.524
Sam?

01:27:44.526 --> 01:27:47.094
I thought that was
you running in.

01:27:47.096 --> 01:27:48.362
Why are you in such a hurry?

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:50.864
I was just looking
for some flowers.

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:54.268
Well, it's really great that
i ran into you, because I

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.303
want to invite you to my party.

01:27:56.305 --> 01:27:58.138
Oh.

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.040
Oh, you know, I'm
actually busy that night.

01:28:00.042 --> 01:28:00.874
Really?

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:02.276
Doing what?

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:05.946
I'm, uh, going out on a
date with my girlfriend.

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:13.053
Your girlfriend's Lexie?

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:14.421
Yeah.

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:16.757
We're really serious.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:17.524
Incredibly serious.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:24.665
We've actually kissed on the
lips like seven times already.

01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:27.668
We'll probably kiss again
when we go on our date.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:28.402
Not at your party.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:32.973
Oh, ok.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:35.342
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:36.443
Don't worry about it.

01:28:36.445 --> 01:28:38.578
Yeah, um, thanks
for the invite.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.781
Sure.

01:28:40.783 --> 01:28:42.449
See you later.

01:28:42.451 --> 01:28:43.250
Bye.

01:28:43.252 --> 01:28:43.984
Hmm.

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:53.827
So you want me to pretend
I'm your girlfriend too?

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:58.832
I don't know, you're kind
of expensive, like 30%.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.667
Well, for the right guy,
i might do it for free.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:06.940
Should we practice?

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:08.041
I'd like that.

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:15.515
Kissy, kissy, kissy.

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:22.289
Tully, what are you doing here?

01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:24.558
I was fixing your,
um-- your, uh.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.492
You're here for the dog.

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:26.927
He missed me.

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:30.831
Hey.

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.632
Hey.

01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:34.000
You look different.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:35.902
Oh yeah, I got a new
doggy razor for beast,

01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:38.538
but I tried it on myself
first because his skin is

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.906
so sensitive.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:41.174
Well, you look great.

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:42.142
Thanks.

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:43.410
Whatcha you doing here?

01:29:43.412 --> 01:29:45.645
I'm fixing your,
uh-- your, uh--

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:46.980
he's here for the dog.

01:29:46.982 --> 01:29:47.981
He missed me.

01:29:47.983 --> 01:29:49.249
Oh, ok.

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:51.184
You know, you guys
need each other.

01:29:51.186 --> 01:29:53.153
Why don't you just take him?

01:29:53.155 --> 01:29:54.054
Yeah?

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:54.988
Yeah.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:56.723
Did you hear that, beast?

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.658
You're coming home with me.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.594
Velma is gonna love you.

01:30:00.596 --> 01:30:02.863
You guys kinda
look the same, too.

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:06.833
Oh, hey, a box came for you.

01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:08.034
Cool.

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:08.769
Nice.

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:15.242
I could probably use this.

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:16.009
Why?

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:24.217
Because of your annoying
habit of being so adorable.

01:30:24.219 --> 01:30:25.051
Yeah.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:26.219
I'm reading this first.

01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:26.953
Lexie.

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:32.592
I have an idea.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.227
How about we go to
the park, reading

01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:36.563
my book aloud while
simultaneously

01:30:36.565 --> 01:30:38.064
listening to your cd?

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:39.800
Hmm.

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:42.736
Can it immediately be followed
by watching a "twilight" movie

01:30:42.738 --> 01:30:44.137
of your choice?

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:47.541
Hmm, that's far too much
excellence in one night.

01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:48.975
I think you're right.

01:30:48.977 --> 01:30:50.010
Let's go straight for the movie.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:06.126
It's time to top off the
night with some team Jacob.

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:07.093
Edward.

01:31:07.095 --> 01:31:08.995
Team Edward.

01:31:10.933 --> 01:31:13.800
Oh, i
poked a bees' nest.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.002
Now I've gone and done it.

01:31:16.004 --> 01:31:20.407
I took a good thing
and messed it up.

01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:24.277
All those things i
wish I didn't do,

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:27.013
but I'd take the fall as
long as is it's for you.

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:30.083
Uh, now I'm gonna have
to get my act together.

01:31:30.085 --> 01:31:31.451
Tell me
about your daughter.

01:31:31.453 --> 01:31:33.453
For starters, she's
socially awkward.

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:36.690
At one time, she was very
interested in, uh, manicuring.

01:31:36.692 --> 01:31:39.593
She's really fashionable,
and he never matches

01:31:39.595 --> 01:31:41.428
his belt with the shoes.

01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:44.130
You give her a
science book, and she's

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:45.765
human chemistry.

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:47.501
So how did
she get a boyfriend?

01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:49.269
We have no idea.

01:31:49.271 --> 01:31:50.670
How did they meet?

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:53.340
She picked him up on
the side of the road.

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:54.608
Hitchhiking.

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:56.843
She was on her
skateboard, and that's

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.979
where she met this, um, fellow.

01:31:58.981 --> 01:32:01.147
Kind of a turd in a
punchbowl kind of thing.

01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:02.983
I hate to confess, but i
actually tried to pay the guy

01:32:02.985 --> 01:32:04.150
off to get him to leave.

01:32:04.152 --> 01:32:05.619
How much did you
offer him, honey?

01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:07.120
Not enough.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:10.857
He recently got her into
anime and that is not ok.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.660
I don't even think that
they talked at all together.

01:32:13.662 --> 01:32:14.895
When he came over--

01:32:14.897 --> 01:32:16.396
they were texting
across the table.

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:17.564
He's a little bit of a bum.

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:18.865
I mean, she's a great girl.

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.000
She deserves a great guy.

01:32:20.002 --> 01:32:21.301
He wants to breed ants.

01:32:21.303 --> 01:32:22.569
I'm not really fond
of his skateboard.

01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:23.837
Who breeds ants?

01:32:23.839 --> 01:32:25.705
Long term is what
I'm worried about.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:28.041
I mean, how are they gonna
provide for my grandchildren?

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.009
We need you.

01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:30.143
We really need your help.

01:32:30.145 --> 01:32:31.177
We love our daughter.

01:32:31.179 --> 01:32:32.846
She's awkward, but we love her.

01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:33.914
They've got to be broken up.

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:35.315
When could you start?
