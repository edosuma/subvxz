00:09.210 --> 00:10.438
Emma: Guys, what's that?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.099
(all screaming)

00:11.110 --> 00:12.759
I said i didn't
think it was tyler.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.701
No one believed me.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.803
But you believe
us now, right?

00:16.010 --> 00:16.499
Yeah.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.046
_ Noah: We're
Into nina's laptop.
Audrey: What is it?

00:18.050 --> 00:19.278
Uh, looks like
a video file.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.941
Oh, my god.
It's emma and will!

00:20.950 --> 00:21.746
Turn it off.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.047
Uploading?
Uploading where?

00:23.050 --> 00:24.642
The file's just been
shared with the listserv.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.810
What listserv?

00:25.820 --> 00:27.708
(phones beeping)

00:28.790 --> 00:31.918
Oh, my god.
It's my first time.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.818
Girl 1: I cannot believe she
came to school today.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.668
Girl 2: If i was her,
i'd just transfer.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.468
(indistinct laughter
and chatter)

00:50.010 --> 00:52.103
Girl 3: Sexy time!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.978
Audrey: Emma!
Hey.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.785
Been there.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.781
Totally sucks.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.150
Yeah.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.652
I just feel so exposed.

01:03.660 --> 01:08.529
There is_a little bit of
cosmic justice at play here.

01:08.730 --> 01:12.166
That which
doesn't destroy us
makes us stronger.

01:12.170 --> 01:16.163
Yeah, or it just takes its
sweet time destroying us.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.838
Em.

01:17.840 --> 01:18.738
(sighs)

01:18.740 --> 01:20.628
Why didn't you
call me back?

01:20.640 --> 01:22.005
Seriously?

01:22.010 --> 01:24.069
How could you film us?

01:24.280 --> 01:25.076
Whoa, hey.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.071
No, em, hey.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.616
I didn't. I swear.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.647
If you didn't do it,
then how does it exist?

01:33.620 --> 01:34.917
Stop.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.328
Look, i don't know.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.525
This sounds like something
jake would do.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.556
No way, because
i'd kill him if he did.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.595
This is a nightmare.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.332
(cell phone ringing)

02:00.820 --> 02:02.378
(laughs)

02:08.320 --> 02:09.753
/(/7/er.'
Hello, emma.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.480
Hows it feel to he
the star of the show?

02:37.520 --> 02:38.680
Quinn, what's up?

02:38.690 --> 02:41.352
What are you doing here?
Damage control.

02:41.360 --> 02:46.320
Sheriff, this is
detective lorraine brock.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.356
State police.
Special task force.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.894
Hello, hud.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.527
It's nice to see you again.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.121
Yeah, raine.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.364
It's been a while.

02:55.370 --> 02:56.997
Hell of a mess you got here.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.738
Yeah, well, we,

02:57.740 --> 03:00.607
We really appreciate all
the extra manpower.

03:00.610 --> 03:05.707
Well, i'm afraid they're going
to be doing a lot more than
just lending a hand.

03:05.710 --> 03:07.701
And don't take it
personally, hud.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.473
There's been a certain
loss of confidence In you.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.948
The governor wants this
case resolved quickly.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.752
What, am i being fired?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.751
Just a temporary
leave of absence.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.285
We need everyone we
have working on this.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.119
Agreed.

03:21.130 --> 03:23.155
I'd appreciate your help
enforcing the curfew.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.389
Huh, right after
crossing guard duty?

03:38.510 --> 03:39.738
Are you kidding me?

03:39.750 --> 03:41.968
You got a problem?
Yeah, i do.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.278
That's riley's seat.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.312
Forever.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.909
Hey, emma, again,

03:49.930 --> 03:53.184
I am just so exponentially
sorry about that video.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.725
I had no idea that it
was gonna just mutate

03:55.730 --> 03:59.894
And spread like this
crazy zombie sex virus.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.937
And that came
out so horribly...

04:02.940 --> 04:04.134
It's okay, noah.

04:04.140 --> 04:06.529
I mean, it's not okay, but...

04:06.540 --> 04:08.735
You couldn't have known
what was going to happen.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.743
(clears throat)
okay, everybody.

04:12.350 --> 04:12.873
(sighs)

04:12.880 --> 04:16.111
We are still reeling
from riley's death,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.281
But we do have
learning to do.

04:18.590 --> 04:19.887
Noah, i know you two
were scene partners.

04:19.890 --> 04:22.814
Uh, yeah, i, i think i'm just
gonna sit this one out.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.856
If that's okay.
I understand.
That's fine.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.849
But we will resume

04:26.860 --> 04:28.555
Our scene work next week.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.755
Let's get back to hawthorne.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.037
The scarlet letter.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.531
It's a classic tale
of hypocrisy,

04:37.540 --> 04:39.599
Misogyny, and
female oppression.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.635
Mr. Branson, seriously,

04:41.640 --> 04:43.130
With all the cyber-bullying

04:43.150 --> 04:45.607
And gifs and
mayhem going down...

04:45.610 --> 04:46.372
Who cares?

04:46.380 --> 04:48.848
(cell phones chime)
mr. Branson: Actually,
jake, it's very relevant.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.341
See, the birth of hester
prynne's illegitimate child

04:51.350 --> 04:53.784
Led to her being
essentially outed

04:53.790 --> 04:55.781
And cyber-bullied,
puritan style.

04:55.790 --> 04:56.814
(phones continue chiming)

04:56.830 --> 04:59.583
It just takes nine months
instead of nine seconds.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.419
Exactly.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.251
Or, uh, three minutes, right?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.220
Shut the hell up!

05:04.230 --> 05:06.061
Emma: Will, stop!
It's enough.

05:06.070 --> 05:08.038
Mr. Branson: Will, back off.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.530
Sit down!

05:11.070 --> 05:12.162
Emma, are you okay?

05:12.170 --> 05:14.468
No. Uh, i'm not okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.708
Um...

05:15.710 --> 05:21.205
I know that our thoughts
are all with the friends
that we've lost.

05:21.450 --> 05:22.576
And so i just wanted to
remind everyone

05:22.580 --> 05:26.880
That there's a candlelight
vigil downtown tonight
at 7:00.

05:27.090 --> 05:30.059
And i hope that all
of you will make it.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.948
(school bell ringing)

05:31.960 --> 05:34.224
People are dicks.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.590
You saw the video?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.953
Nope. Not interested.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.562
You really
didn't watch it?

05:38.570 --> 05:40.367
I like anticipation.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.666
Look, i'm sorry
about riley.

05:45.040 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, it's been a rough
couple of days.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.568
What happened to you?
You just disappeared.

05:51.580 --> 05:56.608
I, uh, i had to drive up
to bloomington to deal with
some insurance stuff.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.178
My mom's accident.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.839
Tell me what happened
at that hospital?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.555
Did the case files
lead you there?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.515
Someone led me there.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.559
You know, it feels like
he planned this video leak.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.425
I mean, i thought i was
doing the right thing,

06:08.430 --> 06:09.624
Trying to find the truth
and really,

06:09.630 --> 06:12.519
He was just putting my
humiliation in my own hands.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.122
You're okay...
I'm not okay.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.961
I am scared every time
i get a phone call.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.608
Every time i get a text.

06:18.610 --> 06:21.932
Everything that i am
doing is backfiring.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.373
Ijust... I'm done.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.599
I'm gonna let the cops
deal with it now.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.348
Look, i... (grunts)

06:27.350 --> 06:32.140
Emma, just remember
you don't have to be afraid.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.712
Okay.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.589
This is my
worst nightmare.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.092
Mine's the one where
you realize all your
teeth are loose.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.453
But yeah, having your

06:44.470 --> 06:47.268
Junior-high sex moves, like,
all going viral...

06:47.270 --> 06:48.794
Dude!
Way worse.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.062
You watched it?

06:50.070 --> 06:51.628
Well, i'm only human.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.766
God!

06:52.780 --> 06:54.839
Did you tell emma the truth?

06:54.840 --> 06:55.499
No.

06:55.510 --> 06:58.547
And emm_a's never
gonna find out.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.769
I've already hurt
her enough.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.213
Aw, you love her.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.609
Get off me, man!
Get off.

07:05.620 --> 07:09.408
Well, let's just focus
on new opportunities.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.723
We're on for tomorrow.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.550
Time to get paid.

07:14.430 --> 07:17.593
Can't believe i let
you talk me into this.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.738
Audrey, i'm sorry.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.950
She deserves to be up there.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.521
She deserved a life.

07:49.930 --> 07:50.658
(sighs)

07:50.670 --> 07:54.424
Quite the charming
twm peaks
you settled into, hud.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.089
Don't call me hud.

07:56.100 --> 07:56.930
You used to like it.

07:56.940 --> 08:00.159
I used to like
a lot of things that
were bad for me.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.670
I don't need you
here to remind me.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.568
Well, i'm here
to fix your mess.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.239
(scoffs) i bet.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.242
And watching you squirm
is just icing on the cake.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.615
I bet.

08:15.420 --> 08:16.352
Hey.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.918
You holdin' it together?

08:17.930 --> 08:20.148
I'm trying. (chuckles)

08:20.400 --> 08:22.095
We all are.

08:23.130 --> 08:28.488
So, audrey, she really
liked rachel, huh?

08:28.770 --> 08:32.308
I'm pretty sure
the feeling was mutual.

08:35.180 --> 08:36.078
What?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.969
Um, it's just...

08:39.180 --> 08:40.807
I talked to rachel's parents,

08:40.820 --> 08:44.369
And they said that audrey
really intimidated rachel.

08:44.390 --> 08:48.986
And that she could get
her to do things that she
wouldn't normally do.

08:48.990 --> 08:53.882
Maybe that's the only way
her parents could justify
their daughter liking a girl.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.993
Mmm, maybe. Sure.

08:57.170 --> 08:57.898
It's just...

08:57.900 --> 09:02.166
It's hard to know
the truth unless you
have the whole story.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.273
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.542
Miss duval?

09:18.550 --> 09:20.415
Uh, detective lorraine brock.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.559
I was hoping i could
speak with you?

09:22.560 --> 09:23.185
Uh, yeah.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.885
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

09:24.890 --> 09:28.053
No, no, no, i'm sorry.
I meant tomorrow.

09:28.060 --> 09:30.392
I'm working out of
the sheriff's office.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.289
So, uh, 7:30?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.434
If that's not too early.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.307
Sure, i could do that.

09:38.510 --> 09:41.331
I'm sorry about
your friends.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.902
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:47.550 --> 09:48.949
(sighs)

09:51.690 --> 09:53.715
Everything okay?

09:54.020 --> 09:55.851
Nothing's okay.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.323
Well, i know.

09:59.530 --> 10:04.297
R/ley was s/X when her
fam/ly moved to lakewooa’.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.360
She was super-tiny

10:07.370 --> 10:10.191
And complete/y s/lent.

10:12.140 --> 10:16.133
I was convinced that
she did/7 ’t speak eng/ish,

10:16.350 --> 10:17.271
$0...

10:17.280 --> 10:18.235
(emma chuckles)

10:18.250 --> 10:19.945
This one day, i..

10:19.950 --> 10:21.474
Tried speaking
to her very loudly,

10:21.480 --> 10:26.088
Th/nk/ng in my 6-year-old
brain that maybe
that would help.

10:26.090 --> 10:28.388
And then this one day,
she just...

10:28.390 --> 10:30.813
Turned to me and she said...

10:30.830 --> 10:32.525
(cell phone chimes)

10:35.700 --> 10:37.099
(gasps)

10:37.600 --> 10:39.124
She...

10:40.370 --> 10:41.837
Um, sorry,

10:41.840 --> 10:46.903
She, uh, turned to me
and she said. . .

10:47.910 --> 10:49.309
Sorry.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.706
Uh, i think the point is,

10:54.920 --> 10:57.172
R/ley got over her shyness.

10:58.850 --> 10:59.714
I mean, i know that i

10:59.720 --> 11:05.681
Would never have had the
nerve to go up to someone
as beautiful as her.

11:05.690 --> 11:06.486
(cell phone chimes)

11:06.500 --> 11:11.096
lVoah:
But i ’m so damn glad
that she came up to me and...

11:11.100 --> 11:13.796
And made...

11:13.800 --> 11:15.893
(noah continues indistinctly)

11:27.250 --> 11:31.118
The guy with the most
amazing girl on his arm.

11:32.950 --> 11:35.612
Because she was that girl.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.448
R/ley was amazing.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.689
(indistinct whispers)

12:22.070 --> 12:24.265
Brock: I understand
someone was calling you.

12:24.270 --> 12:27.398
What?
I read the
incident reports.

12:27.410 --> 12:31.073
Now, i know that you
doubted tyler was the killer.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.570
You were right.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.378
So what did this
person have to say?

12:43.290 --> 12:43.779
Emma?

12:43.790 --> 12:47.624
Uh, nothing. It was just
some brandon james crank

12:47.630 --> 12:49.188
Trying to scare me.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.691
I overreacted.
(chuckles)

12:51.900 --> 12:53.595
Did you know
rachel murray?

12:53.600 --> 12:57.468
No. We have a mutual friend.

12:57.470 --> 12:58.732
Audrey jensen.

12:58.740 --> 12:59.559
Yeah.
Hmm.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.300
Three of the victims
were clearly related,

13:02.310 --> 13:04.437
But rachel murray's staged
suicide, it's an anomaly.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.544
Well, it seems as though
the killer wanted
to send a message

13:07.550 --> 13:10.576
That only the medical
examiner would get.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.351
Well, you'd have to ask
my mom about that.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.782
That's right.

13:17.790 --> 13:18.654
Your mom is the m.E.

13:18.660 --> 13:22.357
Your dad is the only
surviving victim of
brandon james.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.729
And you, your photo was
found at that hospital.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.137
These aren't all
comcndences, emma.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.667
Are they?

13:39.950 --> 13:41.076
That was fast.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.071
I told her what i could.

13:43.080 --> 13:43.910
Meaning what, exactly?

13:43.920 --> 13:48.345
You said there were things you
couldn't tell me because you
wanted to protect me.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.055
I'm starting
to regret that now.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.654
Too late.
It goes both ways.

13:56.930 --> 14:01.094
What part of skinny
iced macchiato, don't
you understand?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.636
Okay. I think
you've had enough.

14:02.640 --> 14:08.101
I'll have a large cup
of coffee and a cup
of ice on her tab.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.475
Okay.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.543
You know you could just
order iced coffee, right?

14:17.550 --> 14:19.689
I like torturing the ice.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.180
(sighs)

14:21.190 --> 14:26.822
So, what brings you to
the verge of full chihuahua?

14:26.830 --> 14:29.594
Is it the whole
self-improvement thing?

14:29.600 --> 14:30.692
Brooke 2.0?

14:30.700 --> 14:33.066
Less bitchy, more truthy?

14:33.500 --> 14:34.694
Come on, tell jake.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.704
Someone has got to tell
emma what really
happened freshman year.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.462
You can't do
that to will.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.801
Trust me, he's at
a breaking point.

14:42.810 --> 14:45.278
Yeah? Well, that's
his problem.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.099
No.

14:46.110 --> 14:47.600
You gotta warn a brother.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.247
Yeah? Well, okay.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.344
Look, i cannot just
keep lying to emma.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.288
Lying to me about what?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.218
Do what you gotta do.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.551
(rock music playing)

15:13.510 --> 15:15.535
Superman wears a
mock-turtleneck now.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.837
Ugh. Don't even
get me started.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.239
I mean, if they ever put
the hulk in bike shorts,

15:19.250 --> 15:20.171
I'm officially done.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.671
Oh, but they're so stretchy.
Hush.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.419
(chuckles)

15:23.420 --> 15:25.240
Hey, take out your phone.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.314
Okay.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.187
Now download the language
arts homework from
the school server.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.579
Why?
Please trust me.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.057
Fine.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.453
Done.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.062
What the what?

15:40.070 --> 15:40.923
You're the nsa?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.931
That video of emma looked like
it was from a webcam,

15:42.940 --> 15:45.829
So i
tron
-ed my way
into the root directory

15:45.840 --> 15:48.104
And i found some
pretty nasty malware.

15:48.110 --> 15:51.079
Lets you access webcams,
security systems, phones.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.208
And it's all attached to our
language arts homework?

15:55.980 --> 15:56.639
Mr. Branson?

15:56.650 --> 15:58.686
The only teacher who still
let's me talk in class.

15:58.690 --> 16:02.410
So branson hacked
people's webcams and
nina kept the files?

16:02.420 --> 16:06.049
I'm hoping he's just
nina's innocent pawn.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.728
I sense an unholy alliance.

16:09.230 --> 16:12.791
Okay. So, before i say
what i have to say...

16:12.800 --> 16:14.324
(sighs)

16:15.840 --> 16:17.592
How hot is your coffee?

16:17.610 --> 16:22.331
Uh, well, it's coffee,
so it's hot.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.329
(stammers) um, so...

16:24.350 --> 16:25.476
Okay, so...

16:25.480 --> 16:29.712
Freshman year, before
we were friends...

16:30.390 --> 16:34.110
You were this pristine
pollyanna type.

16:34.120 --> 16:38.386
And nina thought you needed
to be taken down a peg.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.187
So, one day at lunch,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.623
Will said he thought
you were cute,

16:42.630 --> 16:44.518
And so nina

16:44.530 --> 16:48.830
Bet him that he
couldn't sleep with
you inside of a month.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.738
What?

16:49.740 --> 16:51.139
He took the bet,

16:51.140 --> 16:53.028
Walked over to you and...

16:53.040 --> 16:56.373
And he asked me
to his game.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.277
And that was the first time
that we ever spoke.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.674
Oh, my god.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.714
I'm so sorry, em.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.608
I know i should have
told you sooner.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.315
But the more you became
a part of the group,

17:08.320 --> 17:10.686
The harder it
got to say anything.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.885
Just when i thought this
couldn't get any worse...

17:12.890 --> 17:15.723
Hey, if you wanna
hit me, it's cool.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.391
Just go ahead.

17:22.600 --> 17:26.206
I could say i don't want to be
friends with you anymore.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.170
You could.

17:30.810 --> 17:34.849
But after losing
riley and nina...

17:34.850 --> 17:37.114
I'm so sorry, em.

17:38.690 --> 17:39.611
Everyone lies.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.941
And everyone's sorry.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.809
Just like he said.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.421
I gotta go back to work.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.099
She/la:
Hello, mr. Mayor.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.068
Quinn: Sheila, i, uh, just
wanted to let you know

17:54.070 --> 17:56.493
That i'm not gonna be
able to make
the council meeting,

17:56.500 --> 17:59.060
Because i, well,
have a doctor's appointment.

17:59.070 --> 18:02.506
She/la:
No problem, sir.
I’ll take care of it.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.450
Hello?

18:25.970 --> 18:27.597
(cell phone chimes)

18:52.830 --> 18:57.153
Shoot. I did
what you said.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.599
(sighs)

19:04.070 --> 19:04.991
It's 10,000.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.433
That's_ all i could
get In a day.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.001
(grunts) god!

19:13.550 --> 19:15.006
(panﬁng)

19:15.020 --> 19:16.840
If you want the rest...

19:17.750 --> 19:20.548
You're going about it
the wrong way.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.020
How do i even
know you have it?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.050
(panﬁng)

19:28.760 --> 19:31.092
I am not giving
you $100,000

19:31.100 --> 19:34.820
Without a guarantee that
thing disappears forever.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.035
Okay, i need two days.

20:15.580 --> 20:16.831
What the hell was that?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.501
We said no harm, no foul.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.477
You broke his nose!

20:19.480 --> 20:20.401
Dude, it was bad-ass!

20:20.420 --> 20:23.048
I had the mayor eating
out of my hand.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.972
So you got the money?

20:29.060 --> 20:30.209
Ten grand of it.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.085
But the rest is coming,
trust me.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.124
The rest?

20:38.370 --> 20:41.168
No. I'm not
doing this again.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.489
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.037
Dude, it was just
a little spank.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.205
Will, he's fine!

20:50.210 --> 20:52.132
I'm the one who
took all the risk!

20:52.150 --> 20:54.209
You just stood guard!

20:54.220 --> 20:56.677
You should be thanking me!

20:58.490 --> 21:00.139
Screw you, jake!

21:08.430 --> 21:08.953
Hey!

21:08.960 --> 21:12.020
Hey.
I've been worried about you.
How are you doing?

21:13.170 --> 21:14.967
(voice breaking)
i don't know.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.961
(sobbing)
hey.

21:17.170 --> 21:17.898
Shh.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.799
You know what?
Come here. Come here.

21:21.310 --> 21:22.902
(sighs)

21:23.540 --> 21:25.474
Okay, uh...

21:26.210 --> 21:28.178
So, there may be some

21:28.180 --> 21:31.240
Warm soothing bourbon-type

21:31.250 --> 21:33.810
Liquid in this flask,

21:33.820 --> 21:37.119
But i_could never
offer It to a minor,

21:37.130 --> 21:38.711
But, um...

21:41.400 --> 21:42.651
I'll take it.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.025
(chuckles)

21:48.400 --> 21:50.698
(sniffles) thank you.

21:52.040 --> 21:57.672
I just want to believe in
something that doesn't
turn to utter crap.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.399
Yeah. I hear that.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.845
Aren't you supposed
to say something like,

22:02.850 --> 22:05.045
"hang in there
it's gonna get better?"

22:05.050 --> 22:06.984
I could,
but it'd be a lie.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.446
(scoffs)

22:08.890 --> 22:12.883
Life is like charlie brown
and his football.

22:12.890 --> 22:16.519
That bitch lucy
keeps yanking it away,

22:16.530 --> 22:18.623
But you gotta keep kicking.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.893
What got yanked
away from you?

22:21.900 --> 22:24.460
Well, it would just
sound like some

22:24.470 --> 22:27.064
Angsty southern
playwright bs.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.934
Tell me. (sniffles)

22:33.450 --> 22:35.543
My dad was murdered.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.916
I was too young
to remember him.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.184
And the police
never solved it.

22:40.190 --> 22:43.079
Honestly, i don't
think they tried.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.388
I am so sorry.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.857
Thanks.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.193
Is that why you do this?

22:50.770 --> 22:51.998
Yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.594
I started to ask questions
as soon as i could talk,

22:54.600 --> 22:57.728
And i kind of never stopped.

22:57.740 --> 23:00.607
So i guess we both
have dark daddy issues.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.032
(chuckles)

23:06.410 --> 23:09.277
Um, well...
Hey.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.447
Piper, i...

23:11.750 --> 23:16.255
I know my dad's alive,
but he's been gone for
most of my life.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.750
So...

23:18.090 --> 23:20.081
I know how hard that is.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.693
(sighs) well, we all have
our demons. Right?

23:25.300 --> 23:26.665
Yeah.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.635
Hang in there.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.159
Okay?

23:40.450 --> 23:43.419
Hey, i was hoping you
were working today.
Will, do not.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.843
Whoa.
You all right?

23:46.850 --> 23:48.613
(scoffs) uh...

23:48.820 --> 23:50.412
I was a bet?

23:51.760 --> 23:53.022
I...

23:53.030 --> 23:55.419
Em, i am so sorry.

23:55.430 --> 23:56.795
You have every
right to be mad.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.827
Oh, thank you so much
for your permission!

24:01.040 --> 24:02.632
_ Of course_
I am mad, Will.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.528
I am humiliated!

24:04.540 --> 24:05.962
Just yesterday, you
were swearing to me

24:05.970 --> 24:07.198
That you had no idea

24:07.210 --> 24:07.960
How this happened.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.234
And now i find out
that everything was a lie?

24:11.510 --> 24:13.307
I mean, how is
it possible that

24:13.310 --> 24:14.800
That is all that i was to you?

24:14.820 --> 24:17.118
No, em, that's never
all you were to me!

24:17.120 --> 24:20.214
And you know what
the worst part is?

24:20.220 --> 24:22.085
The worst part is you
didn't even have

24:22.090 --> 24:23.011
The guts to tell me

24:23.020 --> 24:25.409
In all of the time
that we were together.

24:25.430 --> 24:28.081
I had to find out
from brooke.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.318
Okay, look, nina's, nina's

24:30.330 --> 24:33.390
Challenge was messed up,
no doubt, okay?

24:33.400 --> 24:35.527
But that's never what
you were to me, okay?

24:35.540 --> 24:36.893
This was real.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.629
Em, i love you!

24:39.140 --> 24:40.107
Wow.

24:40.110 --> 24:43.204
You sound like a bad
romantic comedy.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.269
Except we
didn't meet cute.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.339
We met sick-twisted.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.047
There's no going back.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.119
Em?

24:50.120 --> 24:53.715
Do not touch me!

24:55.460 --> 24:57.155
Can't we please
just talk?

24:57.160 --> 24:58.855
No, we can't.

24:58.860 --> 25:01.055
Because we're not friends.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.994
We're not together.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.727
We're done.

25:05.370 --> 25:06.689
Em?

25:15.110 --> 25:16.930
(brooke speaking italian)

25:16.940 --> 25:18.237
Quinn: I don't care
if there's a penalty,

25:18.250 --> 25:19.774
I want you to
liquidate it now.
Ciao.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.202
I need those funds
by noon tomorrow.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.245
Daddy, something
is very wrong.

25:23.250 --> 25:27.789
I just spoke with gianluca
at the four seasons in
milan and...

25:27.790 --> 25:29.655
What happened
to your nose?

25:29.660 --> 25:31.412
I'm having work done.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.829
She never checked
in last month.

25:32.830 --> 25:37.153
She always re-stocks
her wardrobe in_ m_i|an before
gomg on a holistic retreat.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.094
Yeah, well, she never
really got that

25:39.100 --> 25:41.466
"giving up worldly
goods" part, did she?

25:41.470 --> 25:42.994
Don't deflect.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.898
What is going on?

25:43.910 --> 25:46.003
Your mother's
not at the ashram.

25:46.010 --> 25:47.102
Where is she?

25:47.110 --> 25:49.271
I checked her into rehab.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.302
What?

25:51.850 --> 25:54.705
Why didn't you, why
didn't you tell me?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.813
Brooke, honey,
they have strict rules.

25:56.820 --> 25:59.687
No outside communication
for 60 days.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.282
Two months?

26:01.490 --> 26:03.253
And you're okay with that?

26:03.260 --> 26:04.750
(sighs) it's
for her own good.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.058
You have to trust me
on this, brooke!

26:08.500 --> 26:10.229
(sighs)

26:16.200 --> 26:18.862
Your mom's a milf
with hidden depths.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.839
She's a lush with
an ironclad pre-nup.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.868
I don't know, i guess
rehab is better than
divorce court.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.542
I just wish i could
talk to her.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.149
Hey, dude.

26:31.450 --> 26:32.178
You told emma?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.909
What? You could
have at least warned me first?

26:34.920 --> 26:35.784
I'm sorry, will.

26:35.790 --> 26:38.782
But this has been
eating away at me
for over a year.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.326
How about you take
a breath, bro?

26:40.330 --> 26:44.391
(scoffs) oh, stop telling me
what to do, bro.

26:45.000 --> 26:45.625
You know what?

26:45.630 --> 26:47.325
If you wanna have a full-on
psychotic melt-down,

26:47.340 --> 26:50.889
Why don't you take it home
to the chickens and the cows?

26:50.910 --> 26:51.968
(grunts)

26:51.970 --> 26:54.165
I am done trying
to help you!

26:54.180 --> 26:55.659
Yeah, you got that right.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.204
(both grunt)

26:57.210 --> 26:58.529
Will, stop!

26:58.550 --> 26:59.949
Whoa, wait!

26:59.950 --> 27:00.700
Stop it! Cut it out!

27:00.720 --> 27:03.041
No, this isn't over!
Yes, it is!

27:06.350 --> 27:08.284
Come on, you know
what, let's go.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.053
Let's go to the nurse.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.429
All right. Now let's put what
we've learned to the test.

27:20.430 --> 27:24.662
But remember,
self-defense is not
about how strong we are.

27:24.670 --> 27:28.800
It's about how well we use
the strength we have inside.

27:28.810 --> 27:31.108
Mr. Dugan: Will, come on up.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.246
And...

27:33.480 --> 27:34.071
Audrey.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.968
Same scenario.
Dark lot,

27:35.980 --> 27:38.847
Guy's larger and stronger.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.878
Now what you
wanna do is, you...

27:44.260 --> 27:44.851
Ahh!

27:44.860 --> 27:48.421
How's it feel to take
it in front of everyone?

27:55.540 --> 27:57.496
(noah clapping)

28:05.150 --> 28:06.777
Looks like our
esteemed mayor's

28:06.780 --> 28:08.873
Self-defense
classes are a hit.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.916
You too cool
for self-defense?

28:10.920 --> 28:11.875
No.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.744
I'm sure they're
very effective.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.547
If you're attacked
in a well-lit gym.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.084
(chuckles)
but, uh...

28:17.090 --> 28:22.187
What happens when
your first warning is
a knife to your throat?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.792
What are you doing?

28:23.800 --> 28:24.721
Attacking you.

28:24.730 --> 28:28.564
I thought you were
supposed to help me
be less afraid.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.688
Are you afraid now?

28:32.070 --> 28:33.401
No.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.404
Good. What's changed?

28:37.880 --> 28:38.972
(chuckles)

28:38.980 --> 28:41.244
Yesterday i was so
embarrassed and

28:41.250 --> 28:43.741
It just kept getting
worse and worse.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.479
And then,

28:45.690 --> 28:47.578
I realized
that i'm here.

28:47.590 --> 28:50.058
I'm alive,
i'm breathing.

28:51.090 --> 28:53.479
And i make my own choices.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.671
Hello?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.773
Hello? Mr. Branson?

29:19.250 --> 29:21.582
Audrey! You can't just
invade a man's laptop!

29:21.590 --> 29:24.559
Oh, please, he's invading
everybody's everything.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.858
Okay, fine, well,
let me do it.

29:30.530 --> 29:33.294
Okay, yeah,
here's the malware.

29:33.830 --> 29:36.594
Hold on, there's
two other user ids.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.831
Looks like his student
aides had access
to the site, too.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.535
Let me guess. Tyler?

29:41.540 --> 29:44.100
Yup. And this semester...

29:45.110 --> 29:46.475
Riley.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.199
Nina, tyler, and riley.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.676
Maybe they all knew
his dirty secret.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.979
What if he killed
them all to keep it?

29:58.890 --> 30:00.858
The laptop was open.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.991
Mr. Branson: Hey, guys.

30:09.200 --> 30:09.894
What's up?

30:09.900 --> 30:13.165
I was just trying to
convince noah to pick
a new scene partner.

30:13.170 --> 30:16.401
Came here to see if,
uh, anybody's available.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.139
Well, everybody's paired up,

30:18.150 --> 30:23.270
But i'm sure somebody would be
open to a dramatic threesome.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.782
Noah?

30:28.390 --> 30:29.687
Yeah.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.185
I'll let you know, mr. B.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.755
Okay.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.915
(cell phone ringing)

31:07.260 --> 31:07.885
Hello?

31:07.900 --> 31:09.549
Emma: (on recording)
we ’re not friends.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.619
We ’re not together.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.120
We ’re done.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.389
What's your point?

31:15.400 --> 31:16.128
(killer laughs)

31:16.140 --> 31:19.098
/(/ller.'
There she Is,
the new emma.

31:19.110 --> 31:20.407
I'm not your project.

31:20.410 --> 31:23.174
/(/ller.'
Then who
are you really?

31:23.180 --> 31:25.398
How about the one
who kicks your ass?

31:25.410 --> 31:26.138
(killer laughs)

31:26.150 --> 31:28.141
This game Is just
too damn fun.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.947
My life is not a game.

31:29.950 --> 31:30.712
Yes, it Is.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.178
And when i say
its over, you lose.

31:42.630 --> 31:46.054
Okay. What aren't
you telling me?

31:47.940 --> 31:50.261
(grunts) uh...

31:51.240 --> 31:53.231
All right. (grunts)

31:55.180 --> 31:59.332
Raine and i worked
together years ago.

31:59.350 --> 32:03.047
She kinda brought out
the, the best and

32:03.250 --> 32:06.413
The worst in me,
you know.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.655
You were together.

32:10.990 --> 32:14.426
Sometimes, when
we were loaded.

32:16.630 --> 32:20.498
But, you know what?
I told you, i'm not
doing that anymore.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.195
The pills or the partner?

32:23.770 --> 32:25.260
Both.

32:26.310 --> 32:27.060
You know, i...

32:27.070 --> 32:31.439
I don't know.
I like seeing
the world clearly.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.012
I like seeing you.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.651
Clearly.

32:55.270 --> 32:58.694
I'm glad you finally
did that. (chuckles)

33:00.340 --> 33:01.807
Me, too.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.209
(moans)

33:17.320 --> 33:19.208
(knocking)

33:27.770 --> 33:29.192
(scoffs)

33:29.200 --> 33:32.590
I come bearing pepperoni
and pineapple.

33:32.610 --> 33:33.360
Your favorite.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.429
(chuckles)
yeah, when i was six.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.772
Please. I know you
like to order kale,

33:37.780 --> 33:42.205
But i know you crave
pepperoni and pineapple.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.878
(chuckles) hey,
jake's gotta eat, too.

33:49.890 --> 33:51.414
I mean, for the will thing.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.125
Ah, yes. The chivalry.

33:53.130 --> 33:58.750
But hey, if i had to choose
between you and will,
that's a no-brainer.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.590
You have, uh...

34:00.600 --> 34:04.991
If you say boobs, i will
eviscerate you with this.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.064
I meant seniority.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.128
We grew up together.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.904
(sighs)

34:11.910 --> 34:15.846
Your family is
like family.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.772
That's sort of
why i'm here.

34:20.450 --> 34:21.280
You know... (stammers)

34:21.290 --> 34:24.987
I think maybe you're
right about the whole
self-improvement kick.

34:24.990 --> 34:27.959
Maybe jake 2.0
is possible.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.654
(chuckles)

34:28.660 --> 34:32.551
Sounds pretty sketch,
but i'm listening.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.167
In the light
of full disclosure,

34:35.170 --> 34:37.991
I gotta get something
off my chest.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.829
I don't know how or why,

34:44.850 --> 34:47.205
But tyler and nina
had a video

34:47.210 --> 34:51.214
Of your dad doing things he
should not have been doing.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.284
Now, i have not
seen this video,

34:54.290 --> 34:57.919
But i know they were
blackmailing him with it.

35:01.430 --> 35:03.455
How do you know that?

35:05.030 --> 35:06.918
After they died,

35:06.930 --> 35:08.989
Will kept the video,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.833
And he picked up
where they left off.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.502
Now, i tried to
talk him out of it,

35:14.510 --> 35:17.707
But he's blackmailing
your dad again.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.009
Why would he do that?

35:21.010 --> 35:25.310
Well, he o’idn ’t get
the scholarship to duke.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.981
I guess he needed
the money.

35:42.470 --> 35:43.698
Detective brock!

35:43.700 --> 35:46.362
I'm into the nina
patterson laptop.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.047
Damn.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.379
No wonder this girl's dead.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.813
Jake: Are you
sure about this?

36:00.820 --> 36:02.344
Brooke: Yes.

36:02.690 --> 36:03.452
(sighs)

36:03.460 --> 36:04.859
I mean, it is your dad.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.954
I know. That's why
i have to see this.

36:08.530 --> 36:10.498
But i do wanna know
why you have it.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.252
Will kept it on his phone.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.319
I mean, clearly he's not
a security-minded guy.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.490
Yeah, well, my dad
sure as hell is.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.663
There's cameras all
over the place.

36:20.670 --> 36:24.504
Relax, this is
a no spy zone.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.301
Last chance to back out.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.513
Brooke, honey?

36:57.610 --> 36:59.009
(gasps)

36:59.010 --> 37:03.970
This can't be happening.
The date stamp.
That's the day after...

37:05.220 --> 37:07.381
After my mom left.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.084
I haven't talked
to her since.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.550
Oh, my god.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.877
Trust me?

37:31.880 --> 37:33.370
I want to.

37:33.650 --> 37:38.872
Is this so i can overcome
my fear of snakes
and poison ivy?

37:40.050 --> 37:42.314
This is far enough.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.516
Far enough for what?

37:45.090 --> 37:46.728
For no one to hear.

37:46.730 --> 37:47.458
(chuckles)

37:47.460 --> 37:48.825
Are you trying
to scare me?

37:48.830 --> 37:50.752
Just close your eyes.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.992
Close them.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.589
All right.
Kieran?

37:58.610 --> 38:02.068
You're walking to your car
late at night

38:04.080 --> 38:06.469
And you have a flat tire.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.979
What do you do?

38:08.980 --> 38:11.847
I call triple-a.

38:11.850 --> 38:16.048
No, they would,
they would never get
to you in time.

38:16.260 --> 38:17.284
Whoa, what are you doing?

38:17.290 --> 38:20.384
Ah, ah. We're conquering
your fears.

38:20.390 --> 38:21.926
Why do you have a gun?

38:21.930 --> 38:23.454
My dad's a cop.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.961
Come on, focus.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.063
Aim at that first can.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.761
Relax.

38:30.770 --> 38:34.035
You're not making
that very easy.

38:34.610 --> 38:37.579
Just keep it steady,
it's gonna kick.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.404
Squeeze the trigger.

38:45.950 --> 38:47.645
Show me.

38:56.430 --> 39:02.164
You know, as much as i would
love to be your full-time
personal bodyguard,

39:03.540 --> 39:05.997
Sometimes you're
gonna be alone.

39:07.770 --> 39:09.306
You want it?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.079
I...

39:14.610 --> 39:16.874
(sighs) i...

39:17.950 --> 39:20.839
I can't. It's...

39:20.850 --> 39:22.408
I can't.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.187
Not your tempo.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.051
(chuckles)

39:27.060 --> 39:28.322
I get it.

39:28.330 --> 39:31.822
It was a really
nice offer, though.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.538
He's not gonna win.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.903
How do you know that?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.876
You said it yourself.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.414
We're alive.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.084
And we want
to keep being alive.

39:56.090 --> 39:58.957
What if he's watching
us right now?

39:59.330 --> 40:00.126
Well, what if he is?

40:00.130 --> 40:01.529
What if he's in the trees,
watching us right now?

40:01.530 --> 40:05.125
Maybe he's already
crept in the back of my
truck to ambush us later.

40:05.130 --> 40:06.768
(nervous chuckle)

40:07.500 --> 40:10.196
All i know is right now,

40:11.070 --> 40:13.038
I'm holding you.

40:13.470 --> 40:14.960
And he's not.
