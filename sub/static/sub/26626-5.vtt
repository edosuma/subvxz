VERITY:
It is said that Mary Webster

03:06.645 --> 03:08.856
was born in England,

03:08.898 --> 03:13.360
but I believe that she crawled
her way out from Hell.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.112
Since I was a child,

03:15.154 --> 03:18.324
I have heard stories
of her covenant with the Devil.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.585
She curses
all those around her,

03:29.627 --> 03:33.047
even my sweet mother,
taking her from me.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.804
Our most godly mayor,
Philip Smith,

03:40.846 --> 03:43.390
sent her for trial
in Northampton,

03:43.432 --> 03:47.269
but the cowards were too afraid
to convict her of witchcraft.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.729
They sent her away to Boston.

03:48.771 --> 03:52.358
But Satan ruled that court
as well.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.527
And now she is back in Hadley.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.529
Mary Webster,

03:57.571 --> 04:00.324

the Devil himself.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.442
I came from the Bostock farm.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.403

was seen near the paddock.

than their... s-souls
and their safety.

05:21.321 --> 05:25.409
Can they see through
their foolish eyes that a witch

05:25.451 --> 05:27.119
curses everything she touches?

You lost this on your visit
last night.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.753
Have you come
to seek your revenge?

06:17.795 --> 06:21.006
My brother's not far.
I'll scream, and he'll come.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.467
You're a stupid girl,
aren't you?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.805

06:27.846 --> 06:29.848
I thought
this was important to you,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.725
the way you flailed after it
last night.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.898
My mother made it for me.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.110
Before you cursed her.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.492
Do you think I don't have
other matters to attend?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.285
Take it, girl.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.739
What are you doing?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.908
Is that Mother's cloak?

07:29.950 --> 07:33.287
The witch was wearing it.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.956
Goody Webster was here?

07:35.998 --> 07:37.958
You must have scared her off.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.378
That is Mother's.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.798
I remember the color.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.927
Did the witch steal this
after she killed her?

07:48.969 --> 07:53.765
Verity, Mother was sick
for many years.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.268
Yes.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.479
So why did she suddenly die

07:59.521 --> 08:02.983
a day after I saw her talking
to that witch?

08:03.025 --> 08:04.943
Do you really think
that an old woman

08:04.985 --> 08:08.113
-can have so much power?
-I think that woman can.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.033
Don't let your head be as soft
as your heart, Levi.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.619

to idle talk.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.293
"Idle talk."

08:21.335 --> 08:25.964
Last year the Byfield boy
was trampled by cattle

08:26.006 --> 08:27.758
as the witch walked past.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.886
And when the witch walked
through our field,

08:30.928 --> 08:32.888
the crop died.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.474
And on moonless nights,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.393
the witch takes the form
of a black cat

08:38.435 --> 08:42.564
with imps suckling
her many teats.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.700

you need Mother's books

08:57.454 --> 08:59.248

that imagination of yours.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.000
-I wasn't finished with that.
-Nor with this.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.628

for flights of fantasy.

his temper turned on me.

better days.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.234
But, then, this is not His work.

on Mary Webster at her home?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.616
What evil did you witness there?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.618
The witch was outside,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.620
-with fire and smoke...
-Yes.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.623
-Yes, and what was she doing?
-She was summoning a demon.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.668
There was a hole in the earth
that was open to Hell.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.088
Good girl, Amy.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.049

10:32.090 --> 10:34.509
She was...
performing dark magic.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.346
-Was speaking
in a demonic language.
-We stole inside

10:37.387 --> 10:39.097

10:39.139 --> 10:40.682

Tell me the truth,
Miss Hollister--

10:54.738 --> 10:56.239
did she speak my name?

10:56.281 --> 10:57.657
Yes.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.701
As I was running away,
she shouted after me,

10:59.743 --> 11:02.120
"Tell Philip Smith
he is cursed by Satan himself.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.122
-The Devil will have his soul."
-I knew it.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.583
She's cursed me.
This fever is not natural.

11:06.625 --> 11:10.253
