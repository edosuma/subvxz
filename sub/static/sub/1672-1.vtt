01:42.536 --> 01:47.039
<i>I was cast into being
in the winter of 1795.</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:49.982
<i>A living corpse without a soul,</i>

01:50.544 --> 01:52.578
<i>stitched, jolted...</i>

01:52.579 --> 01:55.414
<i>bludgeoned back to
life by a madman.</i>

01:55.415 --> 02:00.086
<i>Horrified by his creation,
he tried to destroy me.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:05.869
<i>But I survived and found
my way back to him.</i>

02:07.260 --> 02:08.627
Elizabeth!

02:08.628 --> 02:11.631
<i>A life for a life,
that's what I wanted.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:14.567
<i>I took that of his
beloved new bride.</i>

02:17.437 --> 02:20.106
<i>He pursued me to the far north.</i>

02:21.174 --> 02:23.442
<i>I was immune to the cold.</i>

02:23.443 --> 02:24.986
<i>He was not.</i>

02:53.807 --> 02:57.977
<i>I buried him in his
family cemetery.</i>

02:57.978 --> 03:01.480
<i>It was more than he deserved.</i>

03:01.481 --> 03:03.683
<i>I thought it was the end,</i>

03:04.818 --> 03:08.488
<i>but it was actually
just the beginning.</i>

03:31.645 --> 03:34.223
We have been waiting for you.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.624
You will come with us.

04:26.066 --> 04:30.146
Stop! Naberius wanted
it brought back alive!

05:01.902 --> 05:04.207
That was the last of them.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.046
What do you suppose it was?

05:08.775 --> 05:10.276
I don't know.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.645
Never seen a human
kill a demon before,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.223
and with such strength.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.017
It's been a long time

05:18.018 --> 05:20.289
since I've seen demons
this far north.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.955
There must have been
something special about it,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.659
something Naberius wanted.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.644
"Victor Frankenstein."

05:46.479 --> 05:49.023
The rumors are true.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.153
H's alive.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.121
It's alive!

05:58.992 --> 06:00.193
Your Majesty!

06:09.069 --> 06:11.271
No more than a wild
beast, Your Majesty.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.914
Destroy it and be done with this.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.351
So, you understand reason.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.558
Where am I? How did I get here?

06:24.584 --> 06:26.886
The creatures that attacked
you, what did they want?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.588
- I don't know!
- We heard them speak of Naberius.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.357
Seems he wants this thing alive.

06:31.358 --> 06:34.260
If Naberius wants it alive,

06:34.261 --> 06:36.262
all the more reason to destroy it.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.329
No!

06:37.330 --> 06:38.873
Gideon.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.404
"Him," not "it."

07:15.235 --> 07:19.071
My name is Leonore, High
Queen of the Gargoyle Order.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.310
This is Gideon,
my most trusted warrior.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.109
You were attacked by four demons

07:24.110 --> 07:27.951
under the command of a dark
prince called Naberius.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.994
Fortunately, Ophir and
Keziah were on watch nearby.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.489
They realized who you were
and brought you here,

07:37.257 --> 07:39.459
to our home.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.937
The Gargoyle Order was
commanded into being

07:51.938 --> 07:53.939
by the great Archangel Michael.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.943
It is our sacred duty to wage
war against the demon horde.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.612
666 legions of
hell-spawned creatures

08:00.613 --> 08:03.123
unleashed by Satan after
his fall from heaven.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.221
Humans think of us
as mere decoration.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.256
They do not know, nor could they
conceive of the brutal, unseen war

08:11.257 --> 08:13.198
being fought around them every day.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.962
A war that may one day
determine the very fate

08:16.963 --> 08:18.369
of all mankind.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.434
You have now been
drawn into this war.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.750
I care not for the world of man.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.421
Yes, we've heard the
stories of you.

08:31.778 --> 08:35.357
Shunned by your human
creator, lost and alone.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.528
You would be welcome here.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.120
Until we learn why
Naberius wants you,

08:41.121 --> 08:43.121
I ask that you stay with us,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.564
safe within these hallowed walls.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.193
I go my own way.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.830
Your Majesty, this thing murdered
Victor Frankenstein's wife.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.601
All in the heat of passion,

08:54.067 --> 08:56.668
driven by emotions he was
never taught to control.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.009
He may be more human
than he realizes.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.914
I understand Frankenstein
never offered you a name.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.690
I should like to call you

09:09.049 --> 09:10.523
Adam.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.485
I promise you this, Adam.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.632
Each of us has a higher purpose.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.026
Yours has simply yet
to reveal itself.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.595
These are but some of the scapulars

09:23.596 --> 09:25.197
of our fallen brothers and sisters.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.433
We have always been
outnumbered in battle.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.875
Now, after many
hard-fought victories,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.480
our ranks have thinned.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.279
Demons, however, remain strong.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.176
To help you survive against them,

09:37.177 --> 09:40.722
the Queen has asked us to
provide you with weapons.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.897
Demons can only be
descended by sacramentals,

09:47.921 --> 09:51.728
blessed objects such as the
crucifix or holy water.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.095
Any object can be made
sacramental by marking them

09:56.096 --> 09:58.105
with the blessed symbol
of the Gargoyle Order.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.035
Descended?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.442
When a demon is killed

10:04.704 --> 10:06.747
its spirit descends to hell,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.242
where it remains trapped
for all eternity.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.276
How do you descend a gargoyle?

10:11.277 --> 10:15.425
We are sacramental beings of
light and good. We ascend.

10:15.582 --> 10:19.286
And only at the hands of godless
creatures that have no souls.

10:29.262 --> 10:33.098
You do not want those.
They are blunt and crude,

10:33.099 --> 10:35.438
and far too heavy to wield.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.956
Adam, you have strength
and speed and stamina

10:49.983 --> 10:53.285
far beyond that of any human.
You would use those gifts.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.330
Take sides in a war that
you are already a part of.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.011
I do not care how many
demons it descended.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.175
You should've let me destroy it.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.720
I am not blind to the risks.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.488
The fact is, Adam is alive,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.849
and all life is sacred.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.554
- It is not human born.
- Neither are we, Gideon.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.022
Here.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.892
Lock this in the vault.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.495
It must never fall
into Naberius' hands.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.397
It is but a book, Your Majesty.

11:38.398 --> 11:43.013
It is written proof that God is now
no longer the sole creator of man.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.753
Adam.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.250
If ever you should
change your mind,

11:58.251 --> 12:00.226
you will always find refuge here.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.700
<i>Trusting others is a mistake
you only make once.</i>

12:09.862 --> 12:11.730
<i>And so I resolved to seek out</i>

12:11.731 --> 12:14.166
<i>the farthest corners of the earth</i>

12:14.167 --> 12:15.267
<i>where no human,</i>

12:15.268 --> 12:18.537
<i>demon or gargoyle
would ever find me.</i>

12:18.538 --> 12:21.540
<i>So many years passed,
I lost track of time,</i>

12:21.541 --> 12:25.244
<i>yet I did not grow old
and die, as humans do.</i>

12:25.245 --> 12:28.654
<i>Victor Frankenstein's final curse.</i>

12:29.382 --> 12:32.495
<i>I thought Naberius'
demons had forgotten me.</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:35.665
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

12:40.226 --> 12:44.602
<i>And I unleashed all
my rage upon them.</i>

12:59.712 --> 13:02.756
<i>I had hidden long enough.</i>

13:03.750 --> 13:07.295
<i>Now I would hunt those
who were hunting me.</i>

13:09.889 --> 13:13.127
<i>I returned to the place
I had left so long ago.</i>

13:14.927 --> 13:19.473
<i>The human world had changed
in the time I had been gone.</i>

13:20.933 --> 13:24.774
<i>But some things had not changed.</i>

13:26.339 --> 13:28.740
<i>If the demons could find
me in the wilderness,</i>

13:28.741 --> 13:32.144
<i>it was only a matter of time
before they found me here.</i>

13:32.145 --> 13:36.725
<i>Which is why I had
to find them first.</i>

14:14.220 --> 14:17.789
Naberius, where is he?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.560
Police!

14:21.060 --> 14:22.830
Put down your weapon!

15:21.521 --> 15:23.291
Good evening, Mr. Wessex.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.571
Where does life begin
and where does it end?

15:27.693 --> 15:30.796
Tonight's experiment represents the
culmination of three years of work...

15:30.797 --> 15:35.275
Time is fleeting, Dr. Wade.
I'd ask that you not waste mine.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.446
Commencing reanimation sequence.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.741
<i>Patch clamp amplifier set.</i>

15:42.742 --> 15:44.478
<i>Pulse generators calibrated.</i>

15:44.544 --> 15:46.485
ICD wiring in right ventricle.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.381
<i>Energy output set to three joules.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:52.461
For the record, subject's
heart is currently dormant.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.626
Firing current in three, two, one.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.337
Clear and shock.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.898
Muscle spasms in the
upper torso and legs.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.966
<i>Looks good.</i>

16:07.967 --> 16:10.769
Detecting intracellular electrical
activity in both atria.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.937
We are in the ventricles.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.939
We have an atrial flutter.
Watch out for ectopics.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.950
Irregular ectopic beats
have begun on schedule.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.616
Ventricular fibrillation. Subject's
going into cardiac arrest.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.583
Up the current to 50 joules.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.684
Current raised to 50.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.786
The heart rate's spiking.
There's no defibrillation.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.355
- Double it.
- Current set to 100.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.467
Pulse is fading! Terra!

16:32.758 --> 16:33.859
Double it again!

16:33.860 --> 16:35.494
- No, I can't!
- I said double it!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.595
That'll kill it!

16:36.596 --> 16:37.831
It's already dead!

16:38.664 --> 16:40.138
200 joules.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.138
Come on.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.976
Live.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.897
There's a heartbeat.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.297
Switch to life support.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.499
Life support functioning.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.239
Sinus rhythm established.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.575
It's breathing.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.455
Sir, we have a situation.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.861
You're certain?

17:42.228 --> 17:45.063
<i>No, sir. But the way it attacked,</i>

17:45.064 --> 17:47.499
strong and fast, like a gargoyle.

17:47.500 --> 17:52.115
It descended seven of us.
I managed to fight it off.

17:52.171 --> 17:55.079
I think I wounded it.
I think it's wounded.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.052
It descended seven demons,

18:00.947 --> 18:04.151
yet you escaped?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.685
Well, I thought you'd
want to hear this.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.561
Yes, you presumed.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.729
You presumed to know what I want.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.930
Well, considering how long

18:18.931 --> 18:20.599
you've been hunting the creature...

18:20.600 --> 18:24.269
And you thought I'd want you
to tell me about the creature

18:24.270 --> 18:26.571
rather than capture it yourself.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.911
That's the choice you made.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.084
Yeah.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.016
It's interesting.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.054
Do not ever

18:43.055 --> 18:45.929
presume to know what I want.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.537
Is that understood?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.373
Forgive me,

18:54.400 --> 18:57.706
Prince Naberius.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.865
Ophir, if you think...

19:35.675 --> 19:37.650
No.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.918
No!

19:40.546 --> 19:45.050
When do you begin the final stage?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.686
Uh, Mr. Wessex, our bodies
are the most complex

19:47.687 --> 19:49.366
living organisms in the universe.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.890
Animating a simple
rat is one thing,

19:51.891 --> 19:54.893
but a human is still
far out of reach.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.530
Is it? What do you
know of a scientist

19:58.531 --> 20:01.177
by the name of Victor Frankenstein?

20:02.301 --> 20:04.174
Frankenstein is a myth.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.179
A horror story made
up to scare children.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.307
All scientists are
skeptics, Dr. Wade.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.842
However, I would've suspected

20:10.843 --> 20:13.411
that a scientist in
your particular field

20:13.412 --> 20:15.480
would have to wonder
if such stories

20:15.481 --> 20:17.582
just might have some basis in fact.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.418
Well, electricity couldn't
be harnessed in the 1790s

20:20.419 --> 20:24.089
let alone channeled into a...
A human subject.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.192
And where did he go?
Why did he disappear?

20:27.193 --> 20:29.427
If he really animated
a human corpse,

20:29.428 --> 20:31.496
why not share his technology
with the rest of the world

20:31.497 --> 20:33.734
to save lives, cure paralysis?

20:33.899 --> 20:37.774
Perhaps he wasn't as magnanimous
as you are, Doctor.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.542
Every scientist keeps a record.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.141
Even when their experiments
end in failure.

20:42.374 --> 20:45.043
Look, there ought to be at least
a record of his work somewhere.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.346
Drawings or a set
of notes. Something.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.682
Just because something
is yet to be found,

20:50.683 --> 20:52.920
does not mean it doesn't exist.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.230
But if Frankenstein was real,

20:58.357 --> 21:01.265
if he really did animate a human,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.138
would it help you to study it?

21:05.064 --> 21:07.767
Well, yes, absolutely.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.634
But, Mr. Wessex,

21:09.635 --> 21:11.903
it would have to be over
200 years old by now.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.373
There would be nothing left
but a few brittle bones.

21:15.374 --> 21:18.777
It's the first and only one
of its kind, Dr. Wade.

21:18.778 --> 21:23.927
Who's to say how long such
a subject might live?

21:36.562 --> 21:39.436
Ours is a war that must
be fought in the shadows.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.567
It is not an open battlefield
for you to do as you please.

21:42.568 --> 21:43.940
I'm descending demons, aren't I?

21:43.969 --> 21:47.839
Do not pretend that you are
doing this for us or mankind!

21:47.840 --> 21:50.384
You care only about yourself, Adam.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.912
Do you know a human was
killed in that alley tonight?

21:53.913 --> 21:55.079
I didn't kill him.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.454
Your actions led
directly to his death.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.919
I'll be more careful next time.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.987
There will not be a next time.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.548
You will remain here until the
Queen decides what to do with you.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.826
You cannot keep me here, Leonore.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.906
I can hardly risk unleashing you
on the streets of this city.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.499
My life is my own. You
will not take it from me.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.535
Your life was not granted
to you by the grace of God!

22:17.536 --> 22:19.771
It was fabricated in a laboratory!

22:19.772 --> 22:22.941
And until you learn to use it
wisely, I will do what I must!

22:22.942 --> 22:24.644
Then you are no
better than Naberius!

22:29.615 --> 22:32.116
When I met you,

22:32.117 --> 22:35.264
my first thought was
to have you destroyed.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.123
But then I looked into your eyes,

22:39.124 --> 22:40.826
and do you know what I saw there?

22:41.060 --> 22:45.333
Not a soul, but the
potential for one.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.902
Now, all I see is darkness.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.519
I know of no other way.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.546
I am not human,

23:00.479 --> 23:02.181
nor a gargoyle,

23:03.482 --> 23:05.184
nor a demon.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.200
I am like none other.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.204
Ophir.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.908
How do you plan to remove the
creature from the cathedral?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.176
The gargoyles will protect
it like one of their own.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.379
Yes, I shall be counting on that.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.115
Our casualties will be
high, but necessary.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.684
Zuriel, none of my legions

23:39.685 --> 23:43.288
ever had so worthy a
commander as you.

23:43.289 --> 23:46.624
Would they have sacrificed
themselves so bravely,

23:46.625 --> 23:49.999
so willingly for anyone less?

23:50.562 --> 23:54.132
You know what this
could mean for them.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.279
Do not forget.

23:56.602 --> 24:01.273
Now, bring me
Frankenstein's monster!

24:18.123 --> 24:20.132
Demons are gathering
outside the cathedral.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.369
- How many?
- Fifty or so.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.893
By the power of God,
descend into hell,

24:53.926 --> 24:55.833
Satan and all evil spirits.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.168
Secure the creature!

25:29.828 --> 25:31.701
- Now!
- Ophir.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.697
Give no quarter.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.864
Take as many of them
with you as you can.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.203
You're our last line of defense.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.703
This is your sacred duty.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.909
This way.

26:47.372 --> 26:51.247
Ophir, give me a weapon!
Let me fight for my life!

27:49.434 --> 27:51.580
No!

28:54.333 --> 28:57.101
Keziah. I'll do what I can.

28:57.102 --> 29:00.579
No! I wish to be with Ophir.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.546
It was forbidden by the Order.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.378
It will not be so anymore.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.840
Quickly, go help the others.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.388
- Where's Naberius?
- They're expecting you.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.262
What do you mean, expecting me?

29:52.658 --> 29:56.203
We knew the gargoyles would
do everything they could

29:56.228 --> 29:58.874
to keep you out of Naberius' hands.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.109
<i>But in the heat of battle,</i>

30:03.735 --> 30:07.940
<i>they left unprotected
their greatest treasure.</i>

30:08.907 --> 30:12.486
All we had to do was lure
Gideon and the others away.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.118
This one has a message for you.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.058
From Zuriel.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.521
Tell me where Zuriel took her.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.894
What do you care?

30:24.956 --> 30:26.090
Hmm?

30:26.091 --> 30:28.125
You going to rescue her?

30:31.596 --> 30:35.972
She locked you up!
She despises you.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.636
You are nothing to her,

30:38.637 --> 30:42.717
but another grand human mistake!

30:48.780 --> 30:50.220
Where is she?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.616
Walton Theater!

30:52.617 --> 30:56.697
Gideon is to bring you there
in exchange for Leonore.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.744
Descend in pain, demon.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.343
The light embraces
and protects thee.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.955
Sir.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.791
What are your orders?

32:02.687 --> 32:04.789
- I beg you to reconsider.
- There's no time.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.023
Items in the vault are sacred.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.192
You cannot remove or
replace anything.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.227
Then I shall accept
full responsibility.

32:10.228 --> 32:12.763
You have not the authority
to do this. None of us do.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.598
And the Queen has
expressly forbidden it.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.200
Authority is not the problem.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.903
It is dangerous.
You must know this.

32:17.904 --> 32:19.737
Of course, I know!

32:19.738 --> 32:23.040
But Leonore is the spiritual
leader of the entire Order.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.313
Our only direct link
to the archangels.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.613
And without her, we're but a
dying flock of vigilantes

32:29.614 --> 32:31.589
with no hope of ever
being reinforced.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.020
Is that what you want?

33:39.384 --> 33:41.325
May God forgive me.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.242
Stay where you are, Gideon!

34:04.376 --> 34:05.748
Your Majesty.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.012
- You should not have come.
- Weapons!

34:09.214 --> 34:13.362
I am unarmed. As you instructed.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.763
Where is Frankenstein's creature?

34:15.853 --> 34:17.362
I no longer know.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.931
When I returned to the cathedral,
it had already escaped.

34:21.259 --> 34:22.938
Wait!

34:24.429 --> 34:25.937
I've brought something else.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.600
Gideon, no!

34:28.766 --> 34:32.744
This is the private scientific
journal of Victor Frankenstein.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.672
We found it on Frankenstein's body

34:34.672 --> 34:37.547
the night we rescued the
creature 200 years ago.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.712
It contains, in detail,

34:41.880 --> 34:44.882
how Victor Frankenstein conceived,

34:44.882 --> 34:48.087
and then constructed his
unholy abomination.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.734
And I pray that it might
save my Queen now.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.458
Gideon, I command you, take
the journal from this place,

34:55.460 --> 34:56.793
and let me ascend.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.972
This one came in just this morning.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.107
Morgue sold him to us.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.342
The liver was ruined,

36:18.343 --> 36:20.318
but the other organs
are healthy enough.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.758
Store it with the rest.

36:28.286 --> 36:29.486
What is that?

36:29.487 --> 36:32.456
It looks like Victor
Frankenstein's handwritten account

36:32.457 --> 36:34.500
of how he brought his
creature to life.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.166
This is better for us.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.739
This is everything we need
to bring back our fallen.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.377
We'll let the humans decide that.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.712
You asked for
Frankenstein's creature.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.757
I bring you something
far more edifying.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.752
"Frankenstein."

38:08.753 --> 38:10.721
You said there must be a
record of his work somewhere.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.425
- Uh... Where did you get this?
- Is this real?

38:13.925 --> 38:15.536
You tell me.

38:34.679 --> 38:37.018
We lost 16.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.249
Good warriors, all of them.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.651
I should never have held him here.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.420
This was the creature's
doing, not yours.

38:43.421 --> 38:44.588
If it had not come back...

38:44.589 --> 38:46.590
Was I wrong to keep
the journal from him?

38:46.591 --> 38:48.492
Everything you do is for
the good of humanity.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.400
There is no wrong in that.

38:50.428 --> 38:53.096
However, now that the creature
knows of the journal's existence...

38:53.097 --> 38:54.665
Why must you call him that?

38:54.666 --> 38:57.904
Now that "he" knows, what
are you prepared to do?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.839
Find Adam!

39:01.840 --> 39:03.507
Call every gargoyle you can spare.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.108
Post them on every rooftop.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.010
And when we find him?

39:07.011 --> 39:09.179
Do we bring him back here again?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.656
Sacrifice even more
of us to protect him?

39:12.483 --> 39:15.552
Or do we finally put an end to all of
this, and deny Naberius his prize,

39:15.553 --> 39:17.020
as we should have done long ago?

39:17.021 --> 39:20.190
God may not have put Adam on this
earth, but he did allow him to live

39:20.191 --> 39:23.235
for over 200 years
against incredible odds.

39:23.661 --> 39:27.331
It is not for you or I
to deny God's purpose.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.602
Well, sooner or later,
Your Majesty,

39:31.135 --> 39:32.939
you will have no choice.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.250
Eels.

39:40.411 --> 39:41.681
What was that?

39:41.913 --> 39:44.525
Electric eels, that's where
he got his power from.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.183
You know, it's actually a fish...

39:46.184 --> 39:49.388
Six electric eels
generating 500 volts each.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.355
That's 3,000 volts.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.695
That's enough to kill an elephant.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.661
How long did he hold
the current for?

39:57.662 --> 39:59.933
Three bursts of five seconds each.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.941
That's 15,000 joules.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.977
Makes you wonder how
long that thing lasted.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.840
Think of it, all that energy
coursing through its veins

40:09.841 --> 40:14.544
powering its heart,
lungs, nervous system.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.486
Well, if it survived that at birth,

40:17.548 --> 40:19.159
what would it take to kill it?

40:43.942 --> 40:45.177
Look at its eyes.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.790
The way they hold you.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.716
It suggests a certain
level of intelligence.

40:52.717 --> 40:56.486
Maybe Victor Frankenstein
just drew it that way.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.722
I want to re-examine our
cellular reproduction formula.

40:58.723 --> 40:59.963
I think we've missed something.

41:42.266 --> 41:44.207
Leave him be!

41:45.269 --> 41:49.606
My apologies for the zealous
nature of our security.

41:49.607 --> 41:52.776
Perhaps if you'd simply
knocked on the front door,

41:52.777 --> 41:56.947
this unfortunate awkwardness
might have been avoided.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.218
Who are you?

41:58.282 --> 41:59.893
Charles Wessex.

42:01.452 --> 42:04.496
And you must be Frankenstein.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.660
My name is Adam.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.701
We are all the sons of
our fathers, are we not?

42:09.961 --> 42:14.906
Denying who we are only
means that we are lost.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.779
I am a journeyman,

42:18.236 --> 42:20.416
a partisan of progress.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.506
Like your father, I too seek

42:22.507 --> 42:25.475
to unravel the mortal
coils of life.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.978
This is Dr. Wade.

42:27.979 --> 42:31.353
She's one of the world's most
respected electrophysiologists.

42:31.716 --> 42:32.917
Hello.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.319
I have been trying to replicate

42:36.320 --> 42:38.898
Victor Frankenstein's
stunning triumph

42:39.524 --> 42:41.135
for quite some time.

42:41.159 --> 42:44.568
What I've read of the journal has
already been extremely helpful.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.542
Be reasonable, Adam.

42:47.932 --> 42:50.738
You are a living miracle.

42:50.768 --> 42:54.245
You contain the
answers so many seek.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.506
I seek my own answers.

42:56.507 --> 42:58.508
Of course you do.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.211
Stay with us.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.413
Help us understand
your father's work,

43:03.414 --> 43:06.993
and, together, we can unlock
those answers and more.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.795
Yes...

43:14.625 --> 43:17.627
Victor Frankenstein gave you life,

43:17.628 --> 43:20.809
but he could not restore your soul.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.335
Could he?

44:12.583 --> 44:15.286
There's no sign of the creature.
He could be anywhere by now.

44:15.419 --> 44:16.653
He will find a safe place

44:16.654 --> 44:18.655
where he can study the journal,
then it will come back here.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.789
Come back?

44:19.790 --> 44:23.563
I've been pursuing the creature
for the better part of 200 years.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.535
- It will come back.
- For what?

44:25.997 --> 44:27.931
Mr. Wessex.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.236
Answers.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.767
How can I help you, Doctor?

44:30.768 --> 44:33.670
Well, you can start by please
explaining to me what is going on.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.106
We had a break-in.
It's a simple security matter.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.340
With all due respect, sir,

44:37.341 --> 44:39.276
but Frankenstein's
creature is alive.

44:39.277 --> 44:41.845
- Why don't you go home and get some rest?
- Look, just who are you?

44:41.846 --> 44:44.214
This gentleman works for me.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.326
A sort of extra layer of
security, if you will.

44:46.617 --> 44:48.018
Well, your extra layer of security

44:48.019 --> 44:50.020
just blew any hopes
I might have had

44:50.021 --> 44:51.325
of analyzing that creature.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.690
Didn't you hear what it said?
It wants answers!

44:53.691 --> 44:55.625
And I am the one who might've
been able to provide them!

44:55.626 --> 44:57.227
The only one!

44:57.228 --> 45:01.064
You may be right.
You look tired, Doctor.

45:01.065 --> 45:02.132
It's late.

45:02.133 --> 45:04.067
You really ought to get some rest.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.036
Rest? Mr. Wessex...

45:06.037 --> 45:08.672
We've lost both the creature
and the journal, Doctor.

45:08.673 --> 45:10.407
- What more can you do tonight?
- But, Mr...

45:10.408 --> 45:14.284
I will notify you should we
recover the one or the other.

45:14.312 --> 45:15.786
Go home, Doctor!

45:22.587 --> 45:25.233
<i>"I am not recording the
visions of a madman."</i>

45:25.489 --> 45:29.259
<i>My methods and reasons are
scientifically sound.</i>

45:29.260 --> 45:32.262
<i>Succeeded discovering the cause...</i>

45:32.263 --> 45:33.863
<i>and generation of life.</i>

45:33.864 --> 45:38.068
<i>A graveyard has furnished the
few raw materials I required.</i>

45:38.069 --> 45:39.869
<i>Tonight, I gather my instruments...</i>

45:39.870 --> 45:43.711
<i>shatter the ideal bounds
of life and death!</i>

45:50.615 --> 45:51.953
Thank you.

46:06.697 --> 46:09.138
How certain are you
it will come for her?

46:09.200 --> 46:12.902
It needs someone to make
sense of the journal.

46:12.903 --> 46:14.582
Only she can do that.

47:03.587 --> 47:05.130
I'm not going to hurt you.

47:14.932 --> 47:16.634
Come with me.

47:20.671 --> 47:21.971
Why are you following me?

47:21.972 --> 47:24.374
How close are you to
re-animating a human corpse?

47:24.375 --> 47:27.351
- I can't tell you that.
- Would this help?

47:28.512 --> 47:31.386
Oh, I haven't had the
chance to finish it yet.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.616
What if you examined me?

47:33.617 --> 47:35.285
Back at the Institute?

47:35.286 --> 47:38.092
Not there. Somewhere away from it.

47:38.289 --> 47:40.824
But all my equipment's there.
My notes, my research!

47:40.825 --> 47:42.892
You don't know who it
is you're working for.

47:42.893 --> 47:43.960
Mr. Wessex?

47:43.961 --> 47:45.196
He's not who you think he is.

47:45.863 --> 47:49.909
There's a war... A war
humans don't know about.

47:49.967 --> 47:52.044
It's been going on for centuries.

47:52.069 --> 47:54.337
It could mean the
end of all mankind.

47:54.338 --> 47:56.239
Between who?

47:56.240 --> 47:57.942
Gargoyles and demons.

47:58.242 --> 48:01.978
I think your boss is a demon
prince called Naberius.

48:01.979 --> 48:03.351
A demon prince?

48:03.647 --> 48:07.021
Been hunting me for over 200 years.

48:07.084 --> 48:08.285
Now, I think I know why.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.391
We have to get off the streets.

48:17.995 --> 48:19.230
Come on.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.670
Naberius is storing human corpses
underneath the Wessex Institute.

48:27.671 --> 48:28.906
Corpses?

48:29.173 --> 48:31.841
No, we're still years
away from human trials.

48:31.842 --> 48:33.248
I've seen the bodies.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.457
There's enough to animate an
entire army of monsters like me.

48:39.884 --> 48:43.520
What did you say that
your name was? Adam?

48:43.521 --> 48:46.022
That's the name the
Gargoyle Queen gave to me.

48:46.023 --> 48:48.858
Look, I understand you
probably suffered

48:48.859 --> 48:51.728
severe brain damage during the
reanimation process given the level...

48:51.729 --> 48:54.808
This is real! All of it!

48:55.566 --> 48:57.404
I'm sorry. I...

48:57.701 --> 49:00.643
I just don't believe in
gargoyles and demons.

49:00.704 --> 49:02.440
Frankenstein!

49:05.876 --> 49:07.817
Oh, shit.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.823
Run.

49:25.396 --> 49:26.666
This ends tonight.

50:45.309 --> 50:48.678
I've seen the bodies.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.620
You'll never be able
to control them.

50:50.648 --> 50:54.022
Control has never been the problem.

50:54.818 --> 50:58.555
There are millions of demon
spirits trapped in hell

50:58.556 --> 51:01.491
waiting for the chance to
possess a human body

51:01.492 --> 51:03.865
and return to our world.

51:07.164 --> 51:09.032
What's this got to do with me?

51:09.033 --> 51:11.577
What's in hell that's
got to do with me?

51:11.602 --> 51:15.079
You have no soul,

51:16.340 --> 51:20.647
and a demon spirit can only
possess a body that has no soul.

51:20.844 --> 51:22.579
No. No.

51:28.352 --> 51:30.593
You know what the best thing
about having the journal is?

51:31.455 --> 51:34.431
I no longer need to
bring you in alive.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.166
I need it alive!

51:37.261 --> 51:39.998
I need to study it!

51:40.931 --> 51:42.198
Bring it back to the lab and...

51:42.199 --> 51:44.811
You can read the journal
and study its corpse.

51:45.369 --> 51:48.175
Its corpse won't show me
how its organs function,

51:48.205 --> 51:49.679
how they respond to tests.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.277
Let me bring it back to the
lab where I can open it up,

51:54.278 --> 51:57.425
but keep it alive while I run
my tests for Mr. Wessex.

51:57.715 --> 52:00.156
You can destroy it when I'm done.

52:18.469 --> 52:19.773
The journal!

52:23.574 --> 52:24.946
Ah!

52:33.484 --> 52:35.493
It's okay. Come on.

52:35.586 --> 52:37.954
I'm going to take your
coat off now. Ready?

52:37.955 --> 52:39.088
Look in the cabinet.

52:39.089 --> 52:40.290
Okay.

53:05.115 --> 53:06.316
Sit down.

53:11.288 --> 53:12.523
Sit down, please.

53:13.624 --> 53:15.269
It's okay.

53:17.461 --> 53:19.106
Please, it's all right,
you can sit down.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.600
We can't stay here long.

53:46.090 --> 53:47.523
Okay, hold still, please.

53:47.524 --> 53:50.398
Demons will be looking
for us everywhere.

53:52.096 --> 53:56.039
We have to get to Leonore,
the Gargoyle Queen.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.572
She's the only one
who can help us now.

53:58.669 --> 54:02.105
You saw that thing.
You saw what it was.

54:02.106 --> 54:03.410
I don't know what I saw.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.887
They'll come for you.

54:05.943 --> 54:08.749
- They need you to help them.
- Help them do what?

54:08.779 --> 54:10.981
Animate an army of corpses
to take over the world?

54:11.014 --> 54:13.850
- Corpses possessed by demons.
- It can't happen. It won't.

54:13.851 --> 54:18.227
First thing they'll do is
wipe out the Gargoyle Order.

54:19.056 --> 54:21.297
There's so few gargoyles left,
they won't stand a chance.

54:22.359 --> 54:26.473
Then Naberius will
launch a war on humans.

54:28.398 --> 54:31.408
Kill most, enslave the rest.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.108
Your world will end.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.585
And what will you do?

54:50.087 --> 54:51.288
It has nothing to do with me.

54:51.321 --> 54:52.622
Of course, it does.

54:52.623 --> 54:54.423
You're as much a part of
this world as anybody.

54:54.424 --> 54:57.366
No, I'm different.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.269
You're not that different.

54:59.496 --> 55:02.302
I'm a dozen used parts from
eight different corpses.

55:04.401 --> 55:05.602
I'm a monster.

55:09.106 --> 55:11.149
You're only a monster
if you behave like one.

55:27.257 --> 55:29.960
I've never had to thank a
human for anything before.

55:32.596 --> 55:35.037
Well, we have our uses, I suppose.

55:46.109 --> 55:47.310
Look, Adam...

56:10.133 --> 56:11.937
The journal is not here, sir.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.360
How are you feeling?

56:34.057 --> 56:36.100
I've been through worse.

56:48.438 --> 56:50.584
What happened to
Victor Frankenstein?

56:51.575 --> 56:53.721
They say he vanished after his...

56:54.912 --> 56:56.250
Wife died.

57:06.957 --> 57:08.158
I killed his wife.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.166
He hunted me.

57:16.133 --> 57:18.244
I would've killed him, too.

57:19.937 --> 57:21.946
But he froze to death.

57:22.873 --> 57:24.347
I hated him.

57:27.411 --> 57:29.955
Have you killed anyone since?

57:31.715 --> 57:33.326
Only demons.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.691
I finished reading it.

57:41.391 --> 57:45.294
Seems he refined the process
significantly after you.

57:45.295 --> 57:49.966
I mean, his science is still
incredibly, wildly out of the box,

57:49.967 --> 57:54.274
but, um, I think I
can reproduce it.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.516
Perhaps even improve on it.

57:59.643 --> 58:03.017
Frankenstein promised to make
you a companion, didn't he?

58:04.915 --> 58:06.685
A promise he broke.

58:07.851 --> 58:09.826
Is that why you came to me?

58:11.755 --> 58:14.902
You want me to fulfill Victor
Frankenstein's promise?

58:24.468 --> 58:26.002
- Carl!
<i>- I got your message.</i>

58:26.003 --> 58:27.470
Thought you'd be asleep by now.

58:27.471 --> 58:30.345
Carl, listen to me. I want you
to leave Wessex right now.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.607
<i>Leave?</i>

58:31.608 --> 58:34.309
And I want you to meet
me at the train station.

58:34.310 --> 58:36.012
I've still got all the
data crunching to do.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.419
Carl, please.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.927
Please just trust me.
It's about the journal.

58:40.951 --> 58:42.596
All right, I'll be there in 20.

58:42.619 --> 58:44.389
Okay. Bye.

58:48.125 --> 58:50.498
You shouldn't have done that.

58:50.827 --> 58:54.130
Well, he knows as much about the
re-animation process as I do.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.032
If what you say is true,
then he's in danger as well.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.268
We don't need him.

58:59.136 --> 59:01.009
This isn't about what
you need right now.

59:01.138 --> 59:03.841
I'll go with you, look after you.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.474
You go talk to the Gargoyle Queen.

59:05.475 --> 59:06.842
I'll meet you back here in an hour.

59:06.843 --> 59:08.010
Terra!

59:08.011 --> 59:09.849
That way you can just
look after yourself.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.351
You're good at that.

59:16.019 --> 59:17.698
Here.

59:33.670 --> 59:34.871
Carl!

59:35.172 --> 59:36.544
I'm sorry.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.442
- What?
- They made me do it.

59:39.443 --> 59:41.088
I had no choice. They made me!

59:45.549 --> 59:46.887
Behind you!

59:51.688 --> 59:54.061
You have work to do, Dr. Wade.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:09.308
Release him.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.377
You lied to me.

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.613
Yes, I did.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:19.190
But I had a higher duty to
protect the human race.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.123
Do you understand what
that journal is to me?

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:24.553
It's the chronicle of
how I came to be.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.097
Who I am.

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.992
What I am.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.894
You are a unique, lonely being

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.330
rejected by both your maker
and the rest of humanity.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:37.137
And, as a result, you
are filled with rage.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.602
You do not need a book
to tell you that.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.841
Naberius has found a way to summon
every demon you've ever descended.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.074
What?

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.447
Possession,

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.945
in bodies that have no souls.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.480
Only the dead have no souls.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.151
- What is the use of possessing a corpse?
- There is none.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.167
Unless you could
animate that corpse.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:02.364
Naberius has been planning
this for centuries.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.672
Victor Frankenstein
just made it possible.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:07.502
- How do you know all this?
- I've seen the bodies.

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.805
There are tens of
thousands of them.

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.235
Where?

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.306
We are your friends, Adam.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.139
We will never try to
control you again.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.440
But if you have Victor
Frankenstein's journal,

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.310
surely you see now that
it must be destroyed.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.582
My circumstances have changed.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:29.728
I have someone with
me now, a human.

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:31.357
A scientist.

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.398
I have to protect her.

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:37.293
What would you have us do?

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.564
Get us out of here.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.205
Then I will tell you
where to find him.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.675
Retrieve your scientist,
come back here,

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:55.049
then we shall take you
where you wish to go.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.014
I've made too many
mistakes with you, Adam.

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:00.523
I'll not make another.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:12.261
You put your emotion
before your sacred duty!

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:13.566
Follow him, Gideon.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.740
As soon as you have
the journal in sight,

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.205
destroy him.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.204
Terra?

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:28.998
Remember... I have no soul.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.439
God will surely damn you.

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:33.231
He already did.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.232
I know who you are,

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.539
and I know what you want me to do.

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.639
And I won't do it.

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:48.008
I'd rather die.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.987
Carl!

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.158
Carl!

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.538
Do you want him back?

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.832
Show me how.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:29.346
Excellent.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.813
Thank you, Dr. Wade.

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.530
My Queen!

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.200
We found the creature.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.494
Sir, it's here.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.168
"Him," not "it."

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:17.633
This is the place.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.144
He led us here.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.645
Leave him to me!

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:39.082
Naberius!

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:41.556
Frankenstein.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.286
How good of you to come back.

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:48.060
I've come to destroy
you and this place.

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:51.726
The Gargoyle Order must survive

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:53.907
and mankind with it.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:58.400
You cannot destroy me,

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:01.172
and I have many other
places such as this

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.813
all over the world.

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:08.643
As for the Order and mankind,

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:14.294
nothing can stop their demise,
let alone a monster like you!

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:36.341
Too late, Dr. Wade.

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:39.518
We already have everything
we need from you.

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:57.492
I am a demon prince!

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.731
You will kneel before me!

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:22.319
I know what you want, Adam.
What you've always wanted.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.555
I will make hundreds like you.

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:28.263
<i>Thousands.</i>

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:33.561
<i>I have been gathering human
corpses for centuries,</i>

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:36.798
<i>each one a host for the
legions of demon spirits</i>

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:39.946
<i>I will now summon from hell!</i>

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:44.684
You will be the first.
You will be one of us.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:49.245
And you will no longer be alone.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:28.923
Your Majesty, the moment they
awake, they would be possessed!

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:32.122
Destroy them. Destroy them all!

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:56.437
Welcome, my son.

01:17:56.438 --> 01:18:00.142
You have possessed a
truly remarkable body.

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.488
I am not your son.

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:12.662
And this body is mine.

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.934
No, it's not possible!

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.862
You have a soul!

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.641
Gideon...

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.141
I know.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.049
Then, why did you save me?

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:52.484
Because you finally found
your higher purpose.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.599
Where's the journal?

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:09.365
I don't need it anymore.

01:21:25.147 --> 01:21:27.548
<i>We do not ask for the
lives we are given,</i>

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.790
<i>but each of us has the
right to defend that life.</i>

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:36.025
<i>I have fought to defend mine.</i>

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:39.128
<i>And when the forces
of darkness return,</i>

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.765
<i>you shall know that I am out there</i>

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:45.039
<i>fighting to defend yours.</i>

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:49.906
<i>I, descender of the demon horde.</i>

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:53.983
<i>I, my father's son.</i>

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:57.819
<i>I...</i>

01:21:58.305 --> 01:22:04.264
