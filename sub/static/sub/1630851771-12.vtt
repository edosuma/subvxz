WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:03.667
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:03.667 --> 00:05.083
My body is just shutting down.

00:05.083 --> 00:06.751
I'm really sorry.
I need to leave.

00:06.751 --> 00:09.209
We do have a new stew that'll
be joining this trip.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.959
It's that friend of
yours, Kaylee.

00:10.959 --> 00:12.125
Very excited.

00:12.125 --> 00:13.959
Tony Thornton is our primary.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.709
Retired naval officer, whoa.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.292
Request permission
to come aboard.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.167
-Permission granted.
-Thank you, sir.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.459
Day two, beach picnic,
black-tie dinner

00:21.459 --> 00:23.209
celebrating marriage and
Black excellence.

00:23.209 --> 00:25.167
And, like, all-out,
very romantic.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.209
So, what if we did, like,
a renewal of the vows.

00:27.209 --> 00:29.626
-That's hot.
-Captain Lee could officiate.

00:29.626 --> 00:31.209
That is perfect,
thank you so much.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.209
I don't know how
I feel about this.

00:33.209 --> 00:34.501
Mm-hmm.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.042
What do you want,
you want no help at all?

00:36.042 --> 00:40.083
-No, not at all.
-You look very defensive.

00:40.083 --> 00:46.417
-I just don't know why... yeah.
-It was her or nobody else.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.250
Everybody on the deck team,
including Jake,

00:48.250 --> 00:49.584
needs to step it up.

00:49.584 --> 00:51.375
I noticed Rayna does
a lot of eye-rolling.

00:51.375 --> 00:52.501
She does.

00:52.501 --> 00:54.042
I see one more ----ing eye-roll,

00:54.042 --> 00:55.667
I'm gonna come apart
like a cheap suit.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.375
Just been in the bridge
with captain.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.209
He doesn't wanna see any,
like, eye-rolling,

00:59.209 --> 01:01.125
or anything like that.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.209
Careful,
the eye-rolling happening.

01:03.209 --> 01:04.250
I didn't eye-roll.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.125
-Okay.
-I just smiled.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.959
-Good job, Rayna.
-Thank you.

01:07.959 --> 01:20.501
I think that's one of the best
anchor pulls we've had.

01:20.501 --> 01:23.375
Found my way to melt up
some white chocolate.

01:23.375 --> 01:28.459
You are awesome, Heather,
thank you.

01:28.459 --> 01:30.918
What's wrong, darling?

01:30.918 --> 01:32.375
I'm just, like, tired of this.

01:32.375 --> 01:33.918
I just want to...

01:33.918 --> 01:35.083
-What the [bleep] was that?
-What was that?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.542
What's up?
Are you okay?

01:36.542 --> 01:38.042
-Yeah. What's up?
-What's going on?

01:38.042 --> 01:39.542
Nothing. What's up?

01:39.542 --> 01:41.042
Just I don't wanna talk
about it, it's okay.

01:41.042 --> 01:42.542
Nothing, Rachel just
needed some help.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.042
Check and see if
everything is okay.

01:44.042 --> 01:45.501
Yeah.

01:45.501 --> 01:48.000
I would love to.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.042
Poor thing, I hate
to see that.

01:50.042 --> 01:52.125
Everything all right?
What was that noise?

01:52.125 --> 01:53.209
That was Rayna, she's crying.

01:53.209 --> 01:58.125
-Why?
-I don't know.

01:58.125 --> 02:00.292
I'm trying everything in my
power to bottle everything up,

02:00.292 --> 02:01.626
and I feel like I'm alone.

02:01.626 --> 02:03.209
Whew.

02:03.209 --> 02:05.292
But I can't act happy when,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.459
like, I feel like my
feelings are genuinely,

02:07.459 --> 02:09.584
like, getting played
with like a puppet.

02:09.584 --> 02:12.375
Like, that's what it feels like.

02:12.375 --> 02:17.209
Is Mel gonna be able to come
out this morning, you think?

02:17.209 --> 02:29.125
-Yeah.
-Oh, no.

02:29.125 --> 02:30.125
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.334
Are you okay?

02:31.334 --> 02:32.334
Ugh, yeah.

02:32.334 --> 02:34.042
What's wrong?

02:34.042 --> 02:36.501
I just needed a moment.

02:36.501 --> 02:37.542
Yeah, that's all.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.417
Yeah.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.000
I don't wanna talk.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.542
Fraser, can I get
your assistance

02:42.542 --> 02:44.209
in the galley to help carry
these orders up?

02:44.209 --> 02:45.667
Copy, on my way.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.918
-You're not Fraser.
-I can help, too.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.083
So, did you need me?

02:50.083 --> 02:51.584
Nope, all good.

02:51.584 --> 02:53.250
Look at... look at...
look at the wall over there.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.292
Just look...
that's the orders.

02:55.292 --> 02:56.709
-Wow.
-Yeah.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.542
We're not even halfway through
the charter,

02:58.542 --> 03:00.959
and I'm realizing how much
I have to do today,

03:00.959 --> 03:03.375
and I'm just like,
can I get another espresso?

03:03.375 --> 03:06.584
We've got a beach picnic,
a vow renewal...

03:06.584 --> 03:08.667
honestly, I'm so relieved,

03:08.667 --> 03:10.959
because Kaylee's about
to fly in and save the day.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.042
Those are ready to roll.

03:12.042 --> 03:13.250
Beautiful.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.584
Please take some
weight off my back,

03:14.584 --> 03:21.042
because this thing is
hurting right now.

03:21.042 --> 03:22.584
Okay, perfect,
yeah, of course.

03:22.584 --> 03:23.918
Thank you, dear sir.

03:23.918 --> 03:27.542
Awesome, let's do this.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.375
Yes.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.667
They wanna take her
breakfast to her room.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.250
Okay.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.250
So, she wants the special,
shrimp and grits,

03:34.250 --> 03:36.083
and pancake on the side.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.542
I'ma wait to see
what happens, man,

03:37.542 --> 03:39.542
because she may beat our ass
for asking for crepes.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.459
Very nice.

03:41.459 --> 03:43.042
Another ----ing chef.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.667
Thanks.

03:44.667 --> 03:50.501
D'accord.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.083
Melissa, I have your pancakes.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.626
Is it okay to come in?

03:54.626 --> 03:56.125
Lookit, you guys, the water...

03:56.125 --> 03:57.459
so, there's little
spots of blue.

03:57.459 --> 03:59.292
I think we're good.

03:59.292 --> 04:02.667
Does look like it's turning,
doesn't it, the weather?

04:02.667 --> 04:06.209
No, you're okay.

04:06.209 --> 04:07.542
I know, that'd be great.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.542
Is Rayna okay?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.417
She's fine.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.584
She's not fine, she's not fine,
but it'll be fine.

04:13.584 --> 04:16.000
Hi.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.417
-Thanks, Rayna.
-We should be good.

04:17.417 --> 04:18.375
You good?
She good?

04:18.375 --> 04:20.417
Yeah, yeah.

04:20.417 --> 04:21.459
Perfect.

04:21.459 --> 04:22.626
-Beautiful?
-Perfect.

04:22.626 --> 04:24.083
Thank you.

04:24.083 --> 04:28.209
-Very helpful.
-Thank you.

04:28.209 --> 04:29.918
No, I just said
is everything okay.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.584
What did he say?

04:31.584 --> 04:33.375
And in code, he was like,
nothing's okay on deck, in code.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.626
What does that mean?

04:34.626 --> 04:36.125
You know when, like,
people talk to you

04:36.125 --> 04:37.417
and they don't give
you anything?

04:37.417 --> 04:41.334
But they're, like,
things are sh--.

04:41.334 --> 04:43.417
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.918
What happened?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.626
I don't know, the
Heather situation

04:46.626 --> 04:48.167
kind of still bothers me.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.667
I talked to you about it,
and you say

04:49.667 --> 04:51.375
it shouldn't bother me,
but it does bother me.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.125
No, no, no...
that should bother you.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.334
I know I said that's
something that is...

04:54.334 --> 04:55.667
I never heard it happening,

04:55.667 --> 04:57.584
and that absolutely
should bother you,

04:57.584 --> 04:59.751
and that was absolutely uncalled
for if that's what happened.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.501
-Mm-hmm.
-And you need to address that.

05:02.501 --> 05:04.751
I... I mean,
she apologized to me.

05:04.751 --> 05:05.751
Okay.

05:05.751 --> 05:07.292
And then, like...

05:07.292 --> 05:08.626
like, last time we were out,
but it just

05:08.626 --> 05:11.626
doesn't feel right
when, you know...

05:11.626 --> 05:13.209
just none of it feels right,
if that makes sense.

05:13.209 --> 05:14.626
Of course it does.
It shouldn't feel right.

05:14.626 --> 05:16.334
Yeah.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.375
You know, you don't deserve
to be talked to like...

05:17.375 --> 05:19.083
or, like, had to hear that.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.250
I guess she wasn't really
talking at you, right?

05:20.250 --> 05:21.250
-No.
-Well, that's good.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.083
But... see what I did there?

05:23.083 --> 05:24.417
-Yeah.
-It's called "dipping the line."

05:24.417 --> 05:26.417
A thing that we use
tying up a lot on docks.

05:26.417 --> 05:29.584
But you should never
have to deal with that.

05:29.584 --> 05:35.083
So, if you need to talk
about it, talk about it.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.125
-You ready to come up?
-Yeah.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.083
Coming up.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.751
What made you
cry this morning?

05:39.751 --> 05:41.250
I don't want talk
about it, seriously.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.667
Please talk to me about it?

05:42.667 --> 05:43.959
If you don't wanna
talk right now, but...

05:43.959 --> 05:45.417
Maybe later.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.042
If you don't wanna talk
about it now,

05:47.042 --> 05:48.125
then I'm gonna get you
next chance I can.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.292
Why can't we just talk later?

05:49.292 --> 05:55.584
Fine, we'll talk later.

05:55.584 --> 05:58.626
Go ahead and unclip her.

05:58.626 --> 06:07.417
Thank you, good job.

06:07.417 --> 06:09.959
Eddie, Eddie, Lee.

06:09.959 --> 06:14.125
So, we're gonna do...

06:14.125 --> 06:15.709
Rayna did a good job...

06:15.709 --> 06:19.125
Good.
Did we find out anything?

06:19.125 --> 06:20.959
Sounded like somebody
in distress.

06:20.959 --> 06:23.501
Rayna, she said, "I just don't
wanna talk about it."

06:23.501 --> 06:25.083
I said, "Fine, but we'll
talk about it later."

06:25.083 --> 06:27.042
She did mention there were
some issues between

06:27.042 --> 06:29.167
her and Heather that has
not sat well with her.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.250
Heather has apologized.

06:31.250 --> 06:35.083
I need to find out what
that is, one way or another.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.584
I know what it is.

06:36.584 --> 06:38.083
Well, then tell me.

06:38.083 --> 06:41.417
I guess the other night,
a few day-offs back,

06:41.417 --> 06:47.125
Heather dropped a word that
is extremely derogatory...

06:47.125 --> 06:48.417
What is it?

06:48.417 --> 06:53.334
I can't say it,
but you know what it is.

06:53.334 --> 06:54.334
The N-word.

06:54.334 --> 06:55.501
Yes.

06:55.501 --> 06:57.417
Heather did apologize.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.751
It was never directed at Rayna,
but it doesn't need to be.

06:59.751 --> 07:01.417
I don't like the word.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.292
I can't think
of any context

07:03.292 --> 07:05.083
that I would think it
was acceptable.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.542
I personally
find it offensive.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.334
There's no place for
it on my boats.

07:09.334 --> 07:12.125
Do you know whether
her apology was sincere?

07:12.125 --> 07:14.000
I do not know,
I was not there for it.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
But the crying wasn't because of
that, it was something else.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.459
What was "something else?"

07:17.459 --> 07:19.417
She said, "I don't
wanna talk about it."

07:19.417 --> 07:20.959
I said, "Fine, well, I'm gonna
come back at you later."

07:20.959 --> 07:22.209
You need to get
to the bottom of it.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.626
I will.

07:24.626 --> 07:26.125
Are we ready?

07:26.125 --> 07:27.626
Doug, holy cow, bro.

07:27.626 --> 07:29.250
Bro, you feel it, man?

07:29.250 --> 07:30.417
Hola.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.417
You wanna go to
the beach with me?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.501
Sure.

07:32.501 --> 07:34.167
I'm gonna send you to the beach.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.626
Kaylee should be here by
the time you guys get back.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.042
I just wanna be the one here to,
like, walk her through,

07:37.042 --> 07:38.125
show her where she's at.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.584
Great.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.709
-Where are they going?
-Set-up for the beach.

07:40.709 --> 07:42.125
Okay, good.

07:42.125 --> 07:45.417
How's Melissa,
is she feeling...

07:45.417 --> 07:47.042
-I wanna say they're resting...
-Yeah.

07:47.042 --> 07:48.542
-Because they haven't responded.
-Yeah.

07:48.542 --> 07:49.584
We'll take really
good care of them.

07:49.584 --> 07:50.584
Yeah.

07:50.584 --> 07:53.542
My poor feet.

07:53.542 --> 07:54.626
See how she sits.

07:54.626 --> 07:57.334
Sick!

07:57.334 --> 07:59.334
Sick.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.250
Oh... let her go, got it.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.000
Ah!

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Jake, Jake, Eddie.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.584
I'm inbound.

08:06.584 --> 08:11.709
So, if you guys are ready,
we can make a move to the beach.

08:11.709 --> 08:14.250
I hope y'all enjoy the sun
while you got it.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.250
-Yes.
-Yeah, thank you.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.751
Thank you.

08:16.751 --> 08:18.042
Fraser's there,
he's gonna take care of you.

08:18.042 --> 08:19.709
-Thank you all.
-Thanks, Jake.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.167
What?

08:21.167 --> 08:24.083
Who am I, right?

08:24.083 --> 08:26.083
What the hell does this
look like, a banquet?

08:26.083 --> 08:27.959
----ing circle tablecloth.

08:27.959 --> 08:31.209
All right, Eddie,
don't be shy.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.667
You gotta gun it.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.375
Let's welcome these
people with open arms.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.083
That is absolutely adorable.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.542
Hello, dear sir!

08:38.542 --> 08:42.334
I'm only gonna go first
so I can grab my wife.

08:42.334 --> 08:43.584
Is that our new stew?

08:43.584 --> 08:54.626
I don't know, I think
that provisions.

08:54.626 --> 08:56.250
The laundry and housekeeping?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.584
Do you think she's on there?

08:57.584 --> 08:59.125
Do I look all right?

08:59.125 --> 09:01.167
Why?
Ah.

09:01.167 --> 09:08.417
-Oh, my God, that is her.
-Is that her sitting there?

09:08.417 --> 09:09.417
Yeah.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.209
I feel a little bit betrayed.

09:11.209 --> 09:13.459
I have earned
my place with Heather,

09:13.459 --> 09:15.459
and we work well
with each other,

09:15.459 --> 09:17.417
and I haven't got the best taste
in my mouth at the moment.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.626
But I have no fear.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.584
I'm still the baddest
bitch on board.

09:23.584 --> 09:25.709
You're gonna help
where we need you, otherwise,

09:25.709 --> 09:27.584
stay where you are,
and I'll do the rest.

09:27.584 --> 09:27.584
Yeah.

09:27.584 --> 09:32.459
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

09:32.459 --> 09:34.667
-Well, well, well.
-Woo!

09:34.667 --> 09:37.125
-Buongiorno!
-Whoa, hello, hello!

09:37.125 --> 09:42.626
-Hi!
-Yep.

09:42.626 --> 09:44.375
Come back and annoy
you a little later.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.083
-Thank you.
-Hello!

09:46.083 --> 09:47.584
-Hi, good to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you, Jake.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.250
Thank you for your help.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.250
That's all right.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.250
This is so good.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.542
Welcome aboard My Seanna.

09:52.542 --> 09:53.751
I'll show you
the crew mess first,

09:53.751 --> 09:54.751
so you can get
into some uniform.

09:54.751 --> 09:56.292
Okay.

09:56.292 --> 09:57.751
I have no idea
what I'm walking into.

09:57.751 --> 10:00.083
I know it's mid-charter.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.584
Knowing Heather will
make it a lot easier.

10:01.584 --> 10:02.959
She's one of my best friends.

10:02.959 --> 10:04.667
-Your cabin!
-Oh!

10:04.667 --> 10:06.417
So much room for activities!

10:06.417 --> 10:08.626
So, on my last boat,
Heather and I were roommates.

10:08.626 --> 10:10.751
Mine and Heather's
relationship is, like,

10:10.751 --> 10:13.667
she has a spotlight, and
I'm standing in the background,

10:13.667 --> 10:16.417
still getting some light,
but I'm totally okay with that.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.709
-There's your uniform.
-Cool.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.125
If you wanna
take a couple minutes.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.250
Okay, beautiful.
Thank you.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.250
-Look at you. Yes!
-Anyone want a drink?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.417
Yes.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.501
Oh, my God,
that's ----ing beautiful.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.250
Ooh, language.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.083
♪ I like piña coladas

10:32.083 --> 10:33.459
You like penis enlargers?

10:33.459 --> 10:35.292
♪ Penis enlargers

10:35.292 --> 10:37.209
-Wes, you saw the form?
-I'm watching, I'm watching.

10:37.209 --> 10:41.542
You see the form, Wes?

10:41.542 --> 10:42.542
Ah!

10:42.542 --> 10:44.334
There it is.

10:44.334 --> 10:46.667
No, I'm gonna use my left hand
to give him a chance.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.918
-Hello?
-Hi, how you doing?

10:48.918 --> 10:50.083
Kaylee, this is Captain Lee.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.417
Captain Lee, this is Kaylee.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.626
-How's it going?
-Kaylee, how are you?

10:52.626 --> 10:54.167
-Hi, good to meet you.
-Pleasure.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.751
We're gonna just
get right down to it.

10:55.751 --> 10:57.292
She can fill you in.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.501
-Very cool.
-Okay.

10:58.501 --> 11:00.751
Come on... oh!

11:00.751 --> 11:02.417
Oh, my God!

11:02.417 --> 11:05.250
Let me know what you think...
on ice, of course.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.501
Wow. I'll take it.

11:06.501 --> 11:09.584
-Wonderful.
-Yeah.

11:09.584 --> 11:11.292
So, tonight, dinner's at 7:30.

11:11.292 --> 11:12.584
Seven-thirty.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.626
-When do they wanna do the...
-Vows?

11:14.626 --> 11:16.250
-Mm-hmm.
-After dinner.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.959
Vow renewals.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.417
I don't know why
anyone needs them,

11:19.417 --> 11:22.334
but I have been volunteered.

11:22.334 --> 11:24.667
He's like, we just wanna
love up on our wives,

11:24.667 --> 11:26.459
and I said, "How about
we renew our vows."

11:26.459 --> 11:28.042
-He's like, "Oh, my God."
-You suggested this?

11:28.042 --> 11:29.375
He's like, "This is
the best idea ever."

11:29.375 --> 11:31.292
-You suggested this?
-All the... yes, I did.

11:31.292 --> 11:34.375
I mean, she just
rolled right over it, too.

11:34.375 --> 11:38.584
So, I guess I'm good with it...
said no one, ever.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.584
Pick up the toys by 5:30.

11:40.584 --> 11:42.375
Have them ready to go by 5:30.

11:42.375 --> 11:43.709
Everything's gotta
be wrapped up by 5:30.

11:43.709 --> 11:44.709
So, we'll pick up
the toys at 5:00.

11:44.709 --> 11:45.918
Okay, sounds good.

11:45.918 --> 11:46.918
-All right?
-Thank you, Cap.

11:46.918 --> 11:50.250
Thank you.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.334
I'm so happy you're here,
because you know,

11:52.334 --> 11:54.292
deck team would
be on the interior, helping out,

11:54.292 --> 11:57.000
and we've just been so busy.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.667
I'm excited to be here.
It'll be fun.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.334
-We'll have a good time.
-Yeah.

12:00.334 --> 12:02.584
This is our third charter,
and drop-off tomorrow.

12:02.584 --> 12:04.042
Oh!

12:04.042 --> 12:05.083
Then we get to go out and party.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.751
I came at the perfect time.

12:06.751 --> 12:10.167
People pay a lot of money
to have those curls, man.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.459
No matter how much I put in
or try or anything like this,

12:12.459 --> 12:13.959
as soon as I walk outside
with the wind,

12:13.959 --> 12:16.083
just...

12:16.083 --> 12:17.417
Eddie's on his way now.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.584
Yeah, let's go,
we're ready to go.

12:18.584 --> 12:20.125
Let's rock and roll.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.417
Can I take anything for you?
Are we all good?

12:22.417 --> 12:29.626
-Yes, sir.
-The welcoming crew.

12:29.626 --> 12:30.709
It's not, is that
why you didn't go to the...

12:30.709 --> 12:32.083
Yes.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.501
-Hit it, let's go.
-Woo!

12:34.501 --> 12:37.626
-Let's go, yeah!
-Woo!

12:37.626 --> 12:40.167
-Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
-Woo!

12:40.167 --> 12:41.584
-Success!
-Another one!

12:41.584 --> 12:43.000
That was great!

12:43.000 --> 12:44.501
Hey, hey, hey,
we got a new stew!

12:44.501 --> 12:48.417
We got a new stew, woo!

12:48.417 --> 12:50.334
I think they're
as excited as we are.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.584
Thank you.

12:51.584 --> 12:53.167
-And your name is?
-I'm Kaylee.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.584
Kaylee, how are you doing?

12:54.584 --> 12:56.125
I'm good, I'm excited
to be here.

12:56.125 --> 12:59.292
Excellent, thank you, thank you.
Oh, look at you.

12:59.292 --> 13:00.792
Here you go, madame.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.959
Oh... why is he coming back?

13:02.959 --> 13:04.250
I'm not ready.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.083
We don't wanna go back.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.751
So, this shot's called the
"Orange You Glad to See Me."

13:08.751 --> 13:10.125
Orange You Glad to See Me.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.417
[groaning]

13:13.417 --> 13:15.125
-Good.
-Jake, Jake, Eddie.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.250
We are on our way
back to the yacht.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.083
Copy, Eddie.

13:18.083 --> 13:23.083
I'm ready for the jet-ski.
Who's for the jet-ski?

13:23.083 --> 13:24.501
I'm excited.

13:24.501 --> 13:26.250
If you can tonight,
tonight's the tasting.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.417
I know, I'm really pumped.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.250
And it's all Japanese, Asian.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.626
Yay!

13:30.626 --> 13:32.417
-All right, let's roll.
-So, let's go.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.667
All right,
come on on, darling.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.417
All you.

13:35.417 --> 13:40.209
[bleep], ow.

13:40.209 --> 13:42.459
Oh, he knows how to do it.

13:42.459 --> 13:44.375
Rayna, this is Kaylee.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.918
-Rayna, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

13:45.918 --> 13:47.667
-Roomies.
-Roomies.

13:47.667 --> 13:52.459
-Roomies.
-Yep, that's right.

13:52.459 --> 13:54.626
Woo!

13:54.626 --> 13:55.626
Hi, how's it going?

13:55.626 --> 13:57.125
Our savior!

13:57.125 --> 13:58.584
-Fraser, hi.
-Fraser, nice to meet you.

13:58.584 --> 13:59.584
-How you doing?
-Nice to meet you, I'm Kaylee.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.042
Nice to see you, Kaylee.

14:01.042 --> 14:02.209
Sorry, I'm very
sweaty, post-beach.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.542
Kaylee, Fraser.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.125
You wanna come back on
at 4:00 and freshen up?

14:05.125 --> 14:06.292
Oh, I love you.
Might have a little shower.

14:06.292 --> 14:07.667
Yeah.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.334
It's amazing to hear
the word "break."

14:10.334 --> 14:13.250
It's not something we've been
used to on the past few trips,

14:13.250 --> 14:15.167
but when I come back,

14:15.167 --> 14:18.584
she can stay very much
in the laundry and cabins.

14:18.584 --> 14:21.626
I'll be behind the bar, Kaylee.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.501
-Come back right at 4:00.
-Yeah.

14:23.501 --> 14:24.751
We're gonna put the skis up,
if you guys don't mind,

14:24.751 --> 14:25.751
if you're not using them at all.

14:25.751 --> 14:26.751
-We're done.
-Great.

14:26.751 --> 14:28.125
Rayna, Rayna, Eddie.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.083
-Water on the davit.
-C
opy.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.584
Uh-oh, captain's looking.

14:32.584 --> 14:35.083
-Winching down?
-Winch down.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.167
There you go.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.083
-You wanna jump off?
-Okay, you're good.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.083
It's not cold.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.083
Just jump in.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.083
All right, winching in.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.334
-There you go.
-Okay.

14:43.334 --> 14:45.292
Okay, that's good.
Do you wanna...

14:45.292 --> 14:46.709
Yeah, that's good, that's
good... nice and smooth.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.042
There you go, stop.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.375
Okay, well...

14:49.375 --> 14:50.459
Oh, nice.

14:50.459 --> 14:51.417
-Look good to you?
-Yeah.

14:51.417 --> 14:52.542
Good job.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.334
Serious time.

14:54.334 --> 14:56.334
-No!
-Oh, yeah, you and me.

14:56.334 --> 14:57.751
I don't want to.

14:57.751 --> 14:58.751
Well, that's too bad,
we're talking.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.334
Ugh.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.626
I understand what
happened between you and Heather

15:01.626 --> 15:03.292
-was completely uncalled for...
-Mm-hmm.

15:03.292 --> 15:08.125
And I have your back
on that 100 percent.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.584
It bothered me more because
I feel like I came to you

15:10.584 --> 15:12.584
because I was just, like,
not in the right head space.

15:12.584 --> 15:15.125
I was kinda looking
for you for help,

15:15.125 --> 15:16.459
and you kinda shrugged it off.

15:16.459 --> 15:18.000
So, it just made me feel like

15:18.000 --> 15:20.584
oh, I can't even
really trust my boss.

15:20.584 --> 15:22.417
-I get you, I hear you.
-Yeah.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.167
But I hope you know
that's not the case,

15:24.167 --> 15:26.542
and if I had heard it happen,

15:26.542 --> 15:28.083
I would have shut
that down, because...

15:28.083 --> 15:30.626
-Mm-hmm.
-I do not...

15:30.626 --> 15:32.209
do not have any patience
for that whatsoever.

15:32.209 --> 15:34.042
Mm-hmm.

15:34.042 --> 15:36.709
You know, I do not accept that.
There's no excuse for it.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.334
It is not okay in
any way, shape, or form.

15:38.334 --> 15:39.667
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay?

15:39.667 --> 15:41.292
But that night when you and
I were talking,

15:41.292 --> 15:42.459
you came to me
to apologize

15:42.459 --> 15:43.501
about being
disrespectful to me...

15:43.501 --> 15:45.125
Mm-hmm.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.459
when I was trying to have
a conversation with you,

15:46.459 --> 15:48.125
and that's what
I wanted to focus on.

15:48.125 --> 15:49.125
Well, it could have
just been terrible timing,

15:49.125 --> 15:50.584
and that's my fault.

15:50.584 --> 15:52.167
I didn't want that to feel
like I was trying

15:52.167 --> 15:53.167
to overpower what
the hell my apology was.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.209
Or steer the conversation.

15:54.209 --> 15:55.667
No, I wasn't trying to do that.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.667
But it was something that
was really bothering me,

15:57.667 --> 15:59.250
because it's something that's,
like, kind of important to me,

15:59.250 --> 16:00.501
and I just felt like,
I don't know...

16:00.501 --> 16:03.334
like, it really
hurt my feelings.

16:03.334 --> 16:04.501
I don't know what else to say.

16:04.501 --> 16:06.083
-I hear you.
-Yeah.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.542
And I'm sorry that
I hurt your feelings.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.167
-That's okay.
-That never was my intention.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.542
Listen, I think you're
doing a great job,

16:10.542 --> 16:12.042
and I'm having fun
teaching you do stuff,

16:12.042 --> 16:13.209
but I wanna work
out what's happening

16:13.209 --> 16:14.626
between you and Heather.

16:14.626 --> 16:17.209
-There's nothing to work out.
-Why not?

16:17.209 --> 16:18.667
Because, like, I'm not gonna
be friends with ignorance.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.000
It's just not gonna happen.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.334
I know...

16:21.334 --> 16:22.792
Are you still
gonna continue to work here?

16:22.792 --> 16:23.751
Yeah, but I don't need
to be her friend.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.667
Okay.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.125
I can work perfectly fine with
someone, but I don't need...

16:27.125 --> 16:28.459
-Okay.
-to be their best friend, but...

16:28.459 --> 16:29.667
Well, if there's anything
I can do for you

16:29.667 --> 16:30.667
to make you feel
more welcome here...

16:30.667 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's really important to me.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.584
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay?

16:34.584 --> 16:35.918
Seriously.

16:35.918 --> 16:37.083
I hope so.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.250
Can you trust me?

16:38.250 --> 16:39.417
We shall see.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.292
-We shall see?
-Yeah.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.667
Okay.

16:42.667 --> 16:47.125
One more charter left,
a charter and a day.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.626
Coming up...

16:48.626 --> 16:51.584
Your husbands are
requesting your presence.

16:51.584 --> 16:53.667
Oh, we're gonna start
crying now, ain't we?

16:53.667 --> 16:53.667
Oh!

16:53.667 --> 17:01.375
-Well, well, well.
-Woo!

17:01.375 --> 17:04.042
Lovely for you both
to join me here.

17:04.042 --> 17:06.209
Please be sure to
locate your exit now,

17:06.209 --> 17:08.626
as they may have changed when
you were boarding this aircraft.

17:08.626 --> 17:15.459
We have a full team!

17:15.459 --> 17:21.459
You wanna go down and
let's take a drink with us?

17:21.459 --> 17:23.501
Has everyone met Kaylee?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.542
From New Mexico,
Silver City.

17:26.542 --> 17:30.667
Yeah.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.375
No.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.751
[laughing]

17:34.751 --> 17:37.834
You don't wanna have
a movie night with us.

17:37.834 --> 17:41.334
Oh, man, welcome
to the club.

17:41.334 --> 17:43.751
So much to catch...

17:43.751 --> 17:46.083
All right, I will be decorating
in the sky lounge.

17:46.083 --> 17:52.292
Anyone wants to blow some
things... balloons.

17:52.292 --> 17:53.834
Oh, my gosh.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.709
Very handsome.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.375
Not bad for an old guy.

17:57.375 --> 18:04.584
I mean, not bad at all.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.751
Let's have a great time, ready.

18:07.751 --> 18:09.250
These look good, well done.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.542
Woohoo!

18:10.542 --> 18:12.209
You look like a
chocolate-covered cherry.

18:12.209 --> 18:13.459
You can have some later.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.667
[chuckles]

18:14.667 --> 18:16.292
-Okay, Rayna.
-Yes, ma'am?

18:16.292 --> 18:18.751
Over there is some micros,
they look like radishes.

18:18.751 --> 18:20.334
Let's go ahead and
pull those out.

18:20.334 --> 18:23.334
So, when I was in Japan,
I really fell in love

18:23.334 --> 18:26.083
with the fact that they're
chasing their excellence,

18:26.083 --> 18:27.584
and they don't
reinvent the wheel,

18:27.584 --> 18:28.667
they just perfect it.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.792
This is how we make wasabi.

18:30.792 --> 18:33.501
So, every single
little finite detail

18:33.501 --> 18:37.167
has to come to
the table perfectly.

18:37.167 --> 18:39.459
I may or may
not be a control freak.

18:39.459 --> 18:41.375
Put it in the middle
and make a well.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.417
It's just like making pasta.

18:42.417 --> 18:43.501
Okay.

18:43.501 --> 18:45.209
-All you, now.
-Awesome.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.375
You learned how to do
the wasabi, I taught you.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.125
Nail it.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.584
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't even see that.

18:49.584 --> 18:51.792
-Do you like it?
-Well, hello!

18:51.792 --> 18:53.542
-Hello, look at you guys.
-Hello.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.542
-Fabulous.
-Mm, mm, mm...

18:55.542 --> 18:57.667
-Here we are to party
-You know what I'm saying?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.375
Gorgeous, look
at my sister.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.542
We're gonna wait for
the captain before we sit.

19:01.542 --> 19:05.167
Captain Lee and Rachel, all
the guests are at the table.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.375
Copy.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.501
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

19:08.501 --> 19:09.501
-Sir?
-Well, you all look great...

19:09.501 --> 19:10.709
Yes?

19:10.709 --> 19:11.709
Request permission to
be seated, sir.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.209
Please be seated.

19:13.209 --> 19:15.334
So, the boat you
worked on before this one,

19:15.334 --> 19:17.667
no romances on that boat?

19:17.667 --> 19:18.626
No.

19:18.626 --> 19:20.209
What are you doing, Kaylee?

19:20.209 --> 19:22.709
-Everything wrong, apparently.
-Apparently.

19:22.709 --> 19:24.626
I'm okay being single
Kaylee right now.

19:24.626 --> 19:26.626
One-man show.

19:26.626 --> 19:28.709
That moustache,
on the other hand...

19:28.709 --> 19:30.417
Just kidding.

19:30.417 --> 19:33.250
Heather's been quite
flirtatious herself.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.709
See, that's her personality.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.501
Yes, let's blame it on that.

19:37.501 --> 19:41.334
I really mean this when I say
just exceeding all expectation.

19:41.334 --> 19:43.501
I mean, even with the weather.

19:43.501 --> 19:46.000
Being military,
we grew up being flexible.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.167
-That's what we do.
-Yeah?

19:47.167 --> 19:48.250
That's what we do.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.250
You eat when you get the chance.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.501
Exactly.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.000
You sleep when
you get the chance.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.667
-Sleep when you get the chance.
-Absolutely.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.792
Because you don't know
when either one of them's

19:54.792 --> 19:56.209
-gonna happen again.
-Mm.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.584
Absolutely.

19:57.584 --> 19:59.334
Guys, they are ready
to mother----ing roll.

19:59.334 --> 20:00.751
Fraser and Kaylee,
can I get you to the galley?

20:00.751 --> 20:02.250
Copy that.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.292
The beach was fun,
it was beautiful.

20:04.292 --> 20:06.626
Ah... oh, here we go.

20:06.626 --> 20:09.125
Sometimes, Skipper, you have
to allow people to win

20:09.125 --> 20:11.375
to feel better
about themselves.

20:11.375 --> 20:15.709
Ooh, that was a shot.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.375
Thank you.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.209
Tonight, we're going to Japan.

20:19.209 --> 20:22.501
For your sunumono, you have a
cucumber salad with snow crab,

20:22.501 --> 20:25.167
done with a light sesame
and mirin dressing.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.667
The green under it is moss.

20:26.667 --> 20:30.709
It is for plating,
please don't eat it.

20:30.709 --> 20:32.501
Seaweed salad is amazing,

20:32.501 --> 20:35.083
and I've had some
good seaweed salad.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.626
I have, too.
That's really good.

20:37.626 --> 20:39.334
Can we clear this plate for you?

20:39.334 --> 20:40.459
Ding, ding, ding...

20:40.459 --> 20:42.584
winner, winner, miso dinner.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.709
Captain, what are you drinking?

20:44.709 --> 20:47.751
I am drinking apple juice
and sparkling water.

20:47.751 --> 20:50.000
And you thought
I was pounding them, didn't you?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.542
Did I!
I'm like, go, Captain.

20:52.542 --> 21:02.292
-And he's driving the boat!
-Yeah, yeah.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.209
Can we eat with our hands,
or must we use...

21:04.209 --> 21:08.000
I would use the spoon due to
the fact that it could be hot.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.626
But if you feel that you've
got Kevlar hands, go for it.

21:12.626 --> 21:18.292
I stick mine in the oven...
I think you've seen it.

21:18.292 --> 21:19.459
-How is it?
-That's awesome.

21:19.459 --> 21:24.417
I need nine ramekins
to poach eggs.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.459
How you doing, Rayna?

21:25.459 --> 21:27.042
God is good!

21:27.042 --> 21:28.292
That's good,
I'm glad to hear that.

21:28.292 --> 21:31.083
Sadly, Mel was not feeling well.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.542
Oh, my God, my ear.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.209
Every time I would,
like, chew, it's just...

21:34.209 --> 21:36.042
it's really painful.

21:36.042 --> 21:40.250
I'm hoping by morning
I'll start to feel some relief.

21:40.250 --> 21:41.959
[bleep] yeah.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.209
The two that are here,
are they ready to go as well?

21:44.209 --> 21:45.542
Thank you.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.751
You have caviar served
on top of a poached egg,

21:47.751 --> 21:50.000
with a Japanese mayo.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.125
That's awesome.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.501
Clean-up on aisle three.

21:52.501 --> 21:53.834
[laughing]

21:53.834 --> 21:55.501
Kind of getting
a little bit faster,

21:55.501 --> 22:00.167
because these courses are
gonna ----ing kick my ass.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.334
They've gotta go straightaway,

22:01.334 --> 22:02.584
because these
start moving.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.584
We've got a Japanese
rice cake.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.751
It's, like, moving.

22:05.751 --> 22:07.209
What... what...
what does that mean?

22:07.209 --> 22:08.375
It's dead.

22:08.375 --> 22:09.417
-Okay.
-Why is it moving?

22:09.417 --> 22:11.250
Because the way that it's dried,

22:11.250 --> 22:13.417
the humidity is causing it
to break down in front of you.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.459
It is delicious.

22:16.459 --> 22:19.083
I don't think I've ever had
the same meal twice from her.

22:19.083 --> 22:22.501
Wow.

22:22.501 --> 22:27.501
Not even.

22:27.501 --> 22:29.042
I can't do the cold.

22:29.042 --> 22:32.125
If I get north of Boca,
I get a nosebleed.

22:32.125 --> 22:34.459
Fifth course is the light
at the end of the tunnel.

22:34.459 --> 22:35.626
-Thank you.
-Fabulous.

22:35.626 --> 22:41.334
Tasty, tasty dish.

22:41.334 --> 22:52.501
How are you all holding up?

22:52.501 --> 22:55.501
Melissa being in pain
is a huge bummer,

22:55.501 --> 22:59.375
because I feel that this is
a situation I can't control.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.083
But at the end of the day,

23:01.083 --> 23:01.083
this could be the reason
we lose some tip money.

23:01.083 --> 23:08.292
Lovely for you both
to join me here.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.083
Oh, yeah, matcha ice cream.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.125
Put the rose on top of this.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.209
That's so pretty.

23:13.209 --> 23:15.834
Let's get it in there, boy.

23:15.834 --> 23:18.667
Look at that bad boy.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.292
Looks like you got
a problem there.

23:20.292 --> 23:21.292
You should probably get
a doctor to check that out.

23:21.292 --> 23:22.542
Yeah.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.083
-Oh, wow.
-Thank you, beautiful.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.709
She made it to the finale.

23:25.709 --> 23:27.375
Yes!

23:27.375 --> 23:29.501
Tonight you have a vanilla
panna cotta with

23:29.501 --> 23:32.501
a matcha ice cream and
gold-brushed rose petals.

23:32.501 --> 23:33.667
That's a real rose petal, right?

23:33.667 --> 23:34.751
It is edible.

23:34.751 --> 23:36.167
-Fabulous.
-Thank you.

23:36.167 --> 23:38.542
Dear God, 30,000 tip,
here we come.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.584
-Amazing.
-Thank you.

23:41.584 --> 23:44.209
That was...

23:44.209 --> 23:47.542
I mean, I wish I had a
better word than "amazing."

23:47.542 --> 23:50.751
Ladies, so, I just have
to show you all one thing.

23:50.751 --> 23:52.417
Fellas, I'll be right back.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.667
-Oh, you guys are staying here?
-Yes, please.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.501
Let's have a seat,
and I'll be right back.

23:56.501 --> 23:57.792
Thank you, baby.

23:57.792 --> 23:59.501
Heather, are you ready?

23:59.501 --> 24:00.834
Copy, yes, Captain Lee,
I'm on my way up.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.375
What's going on?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.501
So, you're gonna officiate, sir.

24:04.501 --> 24:07.292
-I love you all.
-I love you, too.

24:07.292 --> 24:10.667
Grab my glasses?

24:10.667 --> 24:12.250
Oh, my gosh!

24:12.250 --> 24:14.709
Your husbands are
requesting your presence.

24:14.709 --> 24:18.501
I will lead you
to your grand surprise.

24:18.501 --> 24:23.584
Oh! Oh!

24:23.584 --> 24:26.375
Oh, we gonna start
crying now, ain't we?

24:26.375 --> 24:28.083
Oh, God.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.375
We all know that this past
year has been tumultuous,

24:30.375 --> 24:33.417
frightening, and shall we say
just a wee bit uncertain.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.334
But the difficult times
have reminded us

24:35.334 --> 24:37.167
of the vows that we
have made our partners.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.501
Today, we're here in
the beautiful Caribbean

24:39.501 --> 24:42.167
to celebrate your bonds
with each other

24:42.167 --> 24:43.626
and reaffirm your vows.

24:43.626 --> 24:45.459
I'd like to finish with,

24:45.459 --> 24:49.292
"I take you, once again,
to be my partner in life.

24:49.292 --> 24:52.083
"I pledge my love,
devotion, faith,

24:52.083 --> 24:55.542
and honor, as I continue
my life with you."

24:55.542 --> 24:57.584
That calls for an "I do."

24:57.584 --> 25:00.292
I do.

25:00.292 --> 25:03.542
[applause]

25:03.542 --> 25:05.584
The way these husbands look
at their wives,

25:05.584 --> 25:08.083
it's probably the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

25:08.083 --> 25:09.292
I want that.

25:09.292 --> 25:10.375
-Thank you.
-Privilege was ours.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.292
I love it.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.125
I love Black love.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.542
I mean, it's honestly something
people my age need to see.

25:15.542 --> 25:17.334
You all look like newlyweds.

25:17.334 --> 25:18.375
Thank you, sir.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.542
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.375
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

25:21.375 --> 25:22.709
Thank you, Heather.

25:22.709 --> 25:23.709
-I appreciate it all.
-Nice job tonight.

25:23.709 --> 25:25.167
Good night.

25:25.167 --> 25:26.501
-Love you all.
-Good night, thank you.

25:26.501 --> 25:27.667
-Love y'all, love y'all.
-Love you guys.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.542
I'm going down.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.501
You're gonna come down too, but
just be on the floor at 7:00.

25:31.501 --> 25:32.542
Have a good sleep, guys.

25:32.542 --> 25:34.751
Good night.

25:34.751 --> 25:37.751
Oh, it was so nice, thank you.

25:37.751 --> 25:40.459
Looks like your conversation
with Rayna went well.

25:40.459 --> 25:43.042
Yes and no.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.375
I feel super deflated after it.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.751
Deflated?

25:47.751 --> 25:49.167
Yeah, because she said
that the main issue

25:49.167 --> 25:51.334
that she was having
was with me.

25:51.334 --> 25:53.209
With you?

25:53.209 --> 25:56.542
Accusing me of brushing off
that information

25:56.542 --> 25:58.125
when I first found out about it.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.542
I... I... and
I think I'm, like, trying...

26:01.542 --> 26:07.501
like, I think I'm already
pressured on another level.

26:07.501 --> 26:10.250
I can understand that.
I did not hear her say that,

26:10.250 --> 26:12.083
and I would have not been
okay with her saying that.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.417
I know you weren't there,
but, like, Jake was there...

26:13.417 --> 26:14.459
Well, I was in the...
I was in the car.

26:14.459 --> 26:15.501
No, it wasn't in the car.

26:15.501 --> 26:17.209
Oh, it wasn't in the car, okay.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.542
It once in the restaurant,
and then I told her, like,

26:19.542 --> 26:21.083
No, you can't say those things.

26:21.083 --> 26:22.542
You need to take care
of yourself

26:22.542 --> 26:24.417
and you need to stand up
for yourself when need be.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.375
But when it comes down to
just getting the job done...

26:26.375 --> 26:28.083
Yeah.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.417
That's what this is about,
is getting the job done.

26:29.417 --> 26:30.834
Yeah.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.375
Try to separate
what's happening personally

26:32.375 --> 26:34.292
with what's happening on deck.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.083
I definitely don't feel like
I just brushed it off and was,

26:36.083 --> 26:37.542
like, everything's
fine, don't worry about it.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.250
Like, ignore that.
Like, I wouldn't do that.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.542
I can appreciate
where she's coming from,

26:41.542 --> 26:44.375
where she might feel
uncomfortable.

26:44.375 --> 26:49.584
But if she can work it out
and work with it,

26:49.584 --> 26:51.626
if she's doing her job,
that's all I care about.

26:51.626 --> 26:53.292
-Okay.
-Okay?

26:53.292 --> 26:54.667
Sounds good to me.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.542
If there's any issues,
let me know.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.834
-You got it, Cap.
-Okay.

26:58.834 --> 27:06.751
-See you in the morning.
-All right, pal. Thanks.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.584
Ah!

27:08.584 --> 27:09.751
Oh!

27:09.751 --> 27:15.626
Oh, you mother----er.

27:15.626 --> 27:17.250
[alarm sounds]

27:17.250 --> 27:27.667
Oh, God.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.083
Do you want to do
something special

27:30.083 --> 27:31.334
for Mel
this morning, something...

27:31.334 --> 27:32.709
Well, I just talked to her,

27:32.709 --> 27:34.584
and she still wants
to rest a little bit.

27:34.584 --> 27:36.375
-She's not gonna come out.
-Okay.

27:36.375 --> 27:40.042
[bleep] yes, check out
corn waffles, mother----.

27:40.042 --> 27:43.209
We have a seafood omelette
with smoked salmon,

27:43.209 --> 27:45.042
crème fraiche, and caviar,

27:45.042 --> 27:47.083
as well as chicken and waffles,

27:47.083 --> 27:49.250
and then a banana
fosters French toast.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.250
Banana foster French toast.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.709
Beautiful.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.334
I woke up with chicken
and waffles on my mind.

27:54.334 --> 27:56.250
Okay.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.417
I don't know if you know this,
but you're kind of a boss.

27:58.417 --> 28:02.209
It ain't easy bein' breezy.

28:02.209 --> 28:03.667
Good sir?

28:03.667 --> 28:05.375
Oh, my. Might put us in a
coma before we leave.

28:05.375 --> 28:06.417
So good.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.375
Chef Rachel.

28:08.375 --> 28:09.375
Let's get outta here, Jake.

28:09.375 --> 28:10.584
Copy that.

28:10.584 --> 28:12.751
Short stay, 10:00.

28:12.751 --> 28:16.375
Anchor secured.

28:16.375 --> 28:19.250
I have Captain Lee's
things drying,

28:19.250 --> 28:20.667
and they're all his,
and these are done.

28:20.667 --> 28:21.751
Fab.

28:21.751 --> 28:23.334
This is amazing.

28:23.334 --> 28:25.250
I know it's, like,
almost there.

28:25.250 --> 28:26.417
-No, it's really organized.
-I can actually breathe.

28:26.417 --> 28:27.751
It's good, it's really nice.

28:27.751 --> 28:31.083
I'm really surprised.
So far, so good.

28:31.083 --> 28:35.209
But my first impressions
take is not always correct.

28:35.209 --> 28:36.542
In fact, it's mostly incorrect,

28:36.542 --> 28:41.209
so I can only hope for
the best on this one.

28:41.209 --> 28:42.209
or are you messing with me?

28:42.209 --> 28:43.417
No.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.542
I did not say
underwear ironed...

28:44.542 --> 28:46.334
Right.

28:46.334 --> 28:47.459
No, no, no, I didn't mean that,
if that's what I said.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.459
-Okay, yeah, I didn't...
-No.

28:48.459 --> 28:49.834
Awesome, thank you.

28:49.834 --> 28:50.834
I'll just be with
the guests, my love.

28:50.834 --> 28:55.375
Okay.

28:55.375 --> 28:56.542
Do you need me to sit on it?

28:56.542 --> 28:58.375
Time to go.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.292
I wonder how long
my flowers will last?

29:00.292 --> 29:01.375
I think I'm gonna cry.

29:01.375 --> 29:02.834
-No, don't cry.
-No crying?

29:02.834 --> 29:04.584
-No, crying.
-Okay.

29:04.584 --> 29:06.375
Clearing at 40 feet.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.292
This is impressive
in these conditions.

29:09.292 --> 29:10.584
As soon as you can with lines,
go for it.

29:10.584 --> 29:12.417
All right, let's tighten 'em up.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.792
-Woo!
-[applause]

29:14.792 --> 29:16.083
Yes!

29:16.083 --> 29:17.584
All right, I need to get ready.

29:17.584 --> 29:19.834
There's a wine fridge
behind the outside bar.

29:19.834 --> 29:21.375
Can you grab me a bottle
of rosé from there?

29:21.375 --> 29:22.709
Mm-hmm.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.375
Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

29:24.375 --> 29:26.417
I need everybody
on the main deck in whites.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.167
Hi.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.417
Have you lost weight?
You're looking fantastic.

29:30.417 --> 29:33.584
-That's not a compliment.
-You look amazing.

29:33.584 --> 29:35.375
I'm just fishing for compliments
from him, that's all.

29:35.375 --> 29:36.501
Oh, my God.

29:36.501 --> 29:39.375
-Thank you.
-Rayna.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.834
-It's my retirement coin...
-Yes.

29:41.834 --> 29:43.542
And I wanted to give it to you,
so you can have one.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.209
No, no, no...

29:45.209 --> 29:47.667
No, no, no, it's my name,
which is everything.

29:47.667 --> 29:48.834
-Oh, my God.
-Thank you.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.667
Thank you so much,
oh, my goodness.

29:50.667 --> 29:54.417
Claudia presented me with her
United States Navy service pin.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.375
It's extremely rare,

29:56.375 --> 29:58.250
and for somebody to present
that to you and say "thank you,"

29:58.250 --> 30:00.375
it means a great deal.

30:00.375 --> 30:01.751
Oh, my God.

30:01.751 --> 30:03.375
-My man.
-I'll see you brother.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.751
So, I was thinking of
some superlatives

30:05.751 --> 30:08.792
to articulate how
wonderful you all are.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.167
I couldn't come up
with anything,

30:10.167 --> 30:12.083
because you're all that good.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.083
And so, the best way
to say thank you

30:14.083 --> 30:16.167
is by saying we love you guys.

30:16.167 --> 30:17.459
Thank you so much.

30:17.459 --> 30:19.292
-Permission to go ashore.
-Granted.

30:19.292 --> 30:20.292
Thank you, sir.

30:20.292 --> 30:21.292
Bye!

30:21.292 --> 30:23.709
Woo!

30:23.709 --> 30:25.626
-Best team ever!
-Ever!

30:25.626 --> 30:27.459
Let's go to work.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.167
-Ah!
-Caw-caw!

30:29.167 --> 30:31.375
All right, let's get into
our off-charter uniform.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.709
Don't, if I get in that,
I'm not coming out.

30:34.709 --> 30:39.626
Oh, God.

30:39.626 --> 30:40.626
And we'll just do
it in sections,

30:40.626 --> 30:42.542
move out to the hot tub.

30:42.542 --> 30:44.334
Me and Rayna are gonna
shag on the Internet.

30:44.334 --> 30:45.459
We're not doing that.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.000
You are going to do it.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
No, but we're just
gonna do pictures,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.667
like my willy on her face...

30:49.667 --> 30:51.334
-My willy on Fraser's face.
-It's gonna be great.

30:51.334 --> 30:54.167
You guys go from different
during the work day

30:54.167 --> 30:57.042
and then as soon as we get off,
you're, like, love triangle.

30:57.042 --> 30:58.542
I know.

30:58.542 --> 31:00.083
That's because I hate him,
working with him,

31:00.083 --> 31:01.459
but I think I like him
for just friends.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.250
I don't think I'd like
you as friends.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.667
Are you serious?

31:04.667 --> 31:06.042
I like you, shut the [bleep] up!

31:06.042 --> 31:07.292
Shut the [bleep] up,
you stupid kid!

31:07.292 --> 31:10.459
I told you...

31:10.459 --> 31:11.751
Coming up...

31:11.751 --> 31:14.459
-What the [bleep]?
-It's a thong.

31:14.459 --> 31:15.667
I'll do squats.

31:15.667 --> 31:15.667
Yeah, look at Jake's ass, again.

31:15.667 --> 31:25.459
Oh, yeah, matcha ice cream.

31:25.459 --> 31:28.709
All right, let's rinse
and dry and pack up,

31:28.709 --> 31:29.709
and get ----ed up.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.834
-The other day...
-Mm-hmm.

31:31.834 --> 31:34.209
I went into that cabina
and I tried the bidet.

31:34.209 --> 31:35.584
It was...

31:35.584 --> 31:37.501
there was something trickling,
so I turned it,

31:37.501 --> 31:39.709
and it shot right in my
face and all of my...

31:39.709 --> 31:42.501
-Shut the [bleep]...
-And all over the ceiling.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.751
And it was so bad,
and I was there on my own.

31:45.751 --> 31:48.209
And then how anyone can put
their foof on top of that...

31:48.209 --> 31:49.751
How anyone can put their what?

31:49.751 --> 31:51.751
You could lose your virginity
on that thing.

31:51.751 --> 31:52.751
What is your...
your what?

31:52.751 --> 31:53.751
-Foof, darling.
-Foof?

31:53.751 --> 31:54.751
Yes.

31:54.751 --> 31:56.083
What's a "foof?"

31:56.083 --> 31:57.417
It's a nice way of calling...

31:57.417 --> 31:58.751
it's a pudenda.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.584
-"Pudenda."
-What's your pudenda?

32:00.584 --> 32:03.250
-Your...
-Your no no square.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.542
Yeah, your...

32:04.542 --> 32:05.709
Okay, you guys need
to use a word...

32:05.709 --> 32:06.792
-Your hoo-hah.
-Your fish purse.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.250
What?

32:09.250 --> 32:12.250
Can I show you?

32:12.250 --> 32:16.584
The bidet is for cleansing
of the lower carriage.

32:16.584 --> 32:20.250
Let's be honest...
like, no one uses them, ever.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.375
Ah!

32:21.375 --> 32:23.667
Oh, my God!

32:23.667 --> 32:27.584
In my ----ing face!

32:27.584 --> 32:30.417
As much as I could
do with a facial,

32:30.417 --> 32:32.209
I just really hope
I don't get pink eye.

32:32.209 --> 32:33.501
That's aggressive.

32:33.501 --> 32:35.334
It is, take your hymen
right off.

32:35.334 --> 32:40.209
Attention all crew, I need
everybody in the crew mess ASAP.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.209
Just throw the money
on me, Captain.

32:43.209 --> 32:44.751
Remember when we had
leg room that one time?

32:44.751 --> 32:46.542
Guys, I feel this, 30k.

32:46.542 --> 32:47.584
We're gonna get the 30k.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.542
I'm going 25.

32:49.542 --> 32:52.417
Everybody got a good dose of
military personnel, didn't they?

32:52.417 --> 32:55.209
I think for the most part,
we rose to the occasion.

32:55.209 --> 32:56.792
These guys, from being
in the Navy,

32:56.792 --> 32:58.542
take a lot of pride
in what they do,

32:58.542 --> 33:00.792
which is what I expect
from each of you.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.709
The tip...
25,000.

33:03.709 --> 33:05.209
On the dot.

33:05.209 --> 33:09.083
That's $2,270 each.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.792
Kaylee, I do appreciate you
coming in on short notice.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.667
Thank you for having me.

33:13.667 --> 33:17.083
And I'm just gonna peel that off
and slide that your way for one.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.542
Well, thank you.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.459
Anybody else that
would like to...

33:20.459 --> 33:23.083
No, guys...
can feel free.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.584
-Welcome aboard.
-Awesome.

33:24.584 --> 33:25.584
Thank you guys so much.

33:25.584 --> 33:27.417
Of course.

33:27.417 --> 33:29.709
For the rest of the day I want
you working hard until 5:00.

33:29.709 --> 33:31.542
We're going to have guests
on tomorrow morning.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.375
We'll be leaving
the dock at 11:00.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.459
So, I guess that's about it.

33:35.459 --> 33:36.542
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

33:36.542 --> 33:38.459
Thank you.

33:38.459 --> 33:39.834
Another one bites the dust.

33:39.834 --> 33:41.375
Power on.

33:41.375 --> 33:42.459
Oh.

33:42.459 --> 33:44.167
-One more.
-One more.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.375
Take us out at the knees.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.709
Hoorah.

33:46.709 --> 33:48.709
We just need to do the
hot tub and aft section.

33:48.709 --> 33:50.375
Man, this thing did get grungy.

33:50.375 --> 33:51.751
Wes, I have a lot of questions.

33:51.751 --> 33:53.250
Yeah, go for it.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.584
Have you ever had
a threesome before?

33:55.584 --> 33:56.751
I have gotten close.

33:56.751 --> 33:58.584
I don't have to ask you, Jake.

33:58.584 --> 34:00.751
Yeah.

34:00.751 --> 34:01.667
-Heather?
-Yeah?

34:01.667 --> 34:03.250
Can you assist me?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.542
Hi.

34:05.542 --> 34:06.751
It's still going.

34:06.751 --> 34:10.209
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

34:10.209 --> 34:11.417
We need to go start the slide.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.584
I'll still be done
before you guys.

34:12.584 --> 34:13.876
Yeah, never...

34:13.876 --> 34:14.876
-Yes, I would.
-Ever happen, ever.

34:14.876 --> 34:15.876
Yes, I would.

34:15.876 --> 34:17.709
Are we all done?

34:17.709 --> 34:18.709
That's the moral of the story.
I'm gonna go grab...

34:18.709 --> 34:19.751
Just grab beers for us all?

34:19.751 --> 34:23.125
Beers?

34:23.125 --> 34:24.751
Oh! [bleep]
Jesus Christ!

34:24.751 --> 34:26.209
Oh, my God.

34:26.209 --> 34:27.542
I've been gone
for five seconds.

34:27.542 --> 34:29.125
Oh!

34:29.125 --> 34:30.375
I'll iron this shirt
if you wanna wear it.

34:30.375 --> 34:31.709
Ooh, that would be nice.

34:31.709 --> 34:33.375
Brr-brr-brr-brr!

34:33.375 --> 34:36.501
I'm the best roommate ever.

34:36.501 --> 34:37.751
Do you mind if
I roll your sleeves?

34:37.751 --> 34:39.417
No, do whatever you want.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.250

Thank you.

Very warm welcome to Kaylee,

36:03.626 --> 36:08.626
-Well done to everyone.
-Thank you!

36:08.626 --> 36:10.626

36:22.209 --> 36:23.667
-Yeah.
-Cheers, everybody.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.250
Thank you, Rayna,
for your help in the galley,

36:25.250 --> 36:26.584
and everyone else too as well.

36:26.584 --> 36:27.876
Cheers, babe.

36:27.876 --> 36:49.751
Thank you for allowing me
to be there.

36:49.751 --> 36:51.751
Rachel has made me realize
that cooking is something

36:51.751 --> 36:55.834
that I would like to take
serious in the future.

36:55.834 --> 36:57.459
It genuinely just
makes me happy.

36:57.459 --> 36:58.792
Don't you know that book,

36:58.792 --> 37:00.292
"Chicken Noodle
Soup for the Soul?"

37:00.292 --> 37:01.626
Like, that's what it feels like.

37:01.626 --> 37:03.626
And honestly,
I need to be my own boss.

37:03.626 --> 37:05.250
A boss-ass bitch.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.459
Rayna, you're an
amazing deckhand.

37:06.459 --> 37:07.709
Yeah.

37:07.709 --> 37:09.459
But your fire turns on
in the kitchen.

37:09.459 --> 37:11.167
In the kitchen.
That's what my mom always says.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.375
-Laser focus.
-Laser focus.

37:12.375 --> 37:13.918
Yeah.

37:13.918 --> 37:15.417
That's your passion...
it's your passion.

37:15.417 --> 37:17.292
I'm so tired,
I wanna be outside.

37:17.292 --> 37:19.250
-I know, we gotta wake you up.
-It'll wake me up.

37:19.250 --> 37:20.459
Do 10 jumping jacks right now.

37:20.459 --> 37:22.709
Dance.
Dance, monkey.

37:22.709 --> 37:24.209
Get up!

37:24.209 --> 37:25.209
-What the [bleep]?
-He has a thong on.

37:25.209 --> 37:27.751
[laughing]

37:27.751 --> 37:30.417
I'll do squats.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.751
Yeah, look at
Jake's ass, again.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.751
You know, at this point he
should just put a shirt on.

37:34.751 --> 37:36.584
You know his ass is
gonna come out

37:36.584 --> 37:38.417
and dick's gonna come
out at some point.

37:38.417 --> 37:42.792
Just put a ----ing shirt on,
that's all you need, man.

37:42.792 --> 37:45.209
Coming up...

37:45.209 --> 37:47.792
Careful, Jake, careful, Jake!

37:47.792 --> 37:50.209
Jake, you asshole!

37:50.209 --> 37:51.584
[laughing]

37:51.584 --> 37:51.584
I'm not ----ing sharing
the back seat with him.

37:51.584 --> 38:00.501
All right, let's rinse
and dry and pack up,

38:00.501 --> 38:02.626
Hey, who wants to go to
the mother----ing bar?

38:02.626 --> 38:03.918
-Good evening!
-Hey!

38:03.918 --> 38:05.584
Hey!

38:05.584 --> 38:07.250
-Oh, he's naked again.
-Ah!

38:07.250 --> 38:13.167
Of course he is.

38:13.167 --> 38:17.959
You're gorgeous.

38:17.959 --> 38:19.959
Yeah?

38:19.959 --> 38:21.334
Oh!

38:21.334 --> 38:23.250
I want to
apologize for something

38:23.250 --> 38:25.667
that you weren't around for,
and that was my apprehension.

38:25.667 --> 38:29.792
The minute that I heard my chief
had brought her second over,

38:29.792 --> 38:31.542
my insecurities went
through the roof.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.667
And I just thought all of my
hard work and my efforts are...

38:34.667 --> 38:36.459
null and void anymore.

38:36.459 --> 38:38.626
But you've taken initiative
and you've respected me,

38:38.626 --> 38:40.292
and I really appreciate that.

38:40.292 --> 38:41.876
Thank you.

38:41.876 --> 38:45.292
I have really got a different
perspective on things now.

38:45.292 --> 38:46.584
I was being immature.

38:46.584 --> 38:48.417
This stemmed from my insecurity,

38:48.417 --> 38:50.417
and I was just being
a little brat.

38:50.417 --> 38:53.584
So, we all need to come
together and do the job.

38:53.584 --> 38:57.792
That's genuinely all
I'm concerned about.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.667
Thank you so much.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.876
Guys, I'm so thrilled, and
that means the world to me.

39:01.876 --> 39:04.584
You both mean
the world to me, honestly.

39:04.584 --> 39:06.375
Do you wanna even up,

39:06.375 --> 39:08.000
because I've just got
double slapped on one cheek.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.876
Do you wanna even it up?

39:11.876 --> 39:13.459
Oh!

39:13.459 --> 39:15.459
Why is your ass so hairless?
It bothers me.

39:15.459 --> 39:17.626
-All right, you guys ready?
-Let's go, come on.

39:17.626 --> 39:20.459
Why is everything
in the water?

39:20.459 --> 39:21.792
Not in my T-shirt,
not in my T-shirt,

39:21.792 --> 39:23.292
I swear to God.

39:23.292 --> 39:26.584
It costs more money than you do.

39:26.584 --> 39:29.626
Careful, Jake, careful, Jake!

39:29.626 --> 39:34.751
-Jake, you asshole!
-[laughing]

39:34.751 --> 39:37.626
Something wrong with him,
honest... I swear!

39:37.626 --> 39:40.709
Jake, put your willy away.
Jake, put your willy away.

39:40.709 --> 39:42.709
Look at those bangers and mash.

39:42.709 --> 39:48.417
I was blinded by sex appeal,
100 percent.

39:48.417 --> 39:49.876
I'm not ----ing sharing
a back seat with him,

39:49.876 --> 39:52.292
that's for sure.

39:52.292 --> 40:01.292
You're getting in the back.

40:01.292 --> 40:08.751
Stop ----ing rubbing
your Goddamn nipples!

40:08.751 --> 40:09.834
That was epic.

40:09.834 --> 40:11.417
----ing animal.

40:11.417 --> 40:13.751
Baby boy.

40:13.751 --> 40:18.417
Ass is out,
everything's out.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.459
[belches]

40:20.459 --> 40:22.125
Oh, do you wanna see our bidet?
I was telling you about this.

40:22.125 --> 40:26.375
Follow me!

40:26.375 --> 40:31.751
You set my soul on fire.

40:31.751 --> 40:33.751
I've never seen so many
----ing tubes

40:33.751 --> 40:36.459
in the back of a ----ing bidet.

40:36.459 --> 40:38.876
I'm gonna be so drunk
when we get into bed.

40:38.876 --> 40:45.584
-You're wasted already.
-Yeah.

40:45.584 --> 40:47.209
-Hot water, cold water.
-Just turn it, just turn it.

40:47.209 --> 40:48.584
Why is it hot?

40:48.584 --> 40:50.417
I'm ----ing soaked.

40:50.417 --> 40:53.292
I feel like the one person
I'm gonna stay friends with

40:53.292 --> 40:56.250
out of here on
this boat is you.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.834
I do, too.

40:57.834 --> 41:01.250
The fact that we have
such a good, like,

41:01.250 --> 41:04.250
relationship as
a mate is so good.

41:04.250 --> 41:05.918
-Yeah.
-So good.

41:05.918 --> 41:07.792
Most of these guys in yachting,

41:07.792 --> 41:12.334
they've all been at boarding
school and very privileged.

41:12.334 --> 41:14.834
and I don't consider myself
a yachty twat either.

41:14.834 --> 41:18.250
So, as different as we are,
friends for ----ing life.

41:18.250 --> 41:19.751
Should we go to bed?

41:19.751 --> 41:22.292
Is this all booty juice
all over you, from the bidet?

41:22.292 --> 41:23.626
Yeah, it's covering me.

41:23.626 --> 41:27.709
No, no, no, no, no, no! No!

41:27.709 --> 41:29.459
-Love you.
-Love you so much.

41:29.459 --> 41:35.375
-I'll see you in the morning.
-See you in the morning.

41:35.375 --> 41:37.709
-Mwah.
-My own.

41:37.709 --> 41:39.709
-Good night.
-Sweet dreams, darlin'.

41:39.709 --> 41:43.792
-Good night.
-Good night.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.584
Next, on "Below Deck"...

41:45.584 --> 41:47.250
The last one of
the season, kids.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.375
Jennifer is a real
estate entrepreneur.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.709

her booming business

41:51.709 --> 41:53.459

41:53.459 --> 41:54.459

-Hello.

41:55.709 --> 41:57.250

"Hamilton."

41:59.667 --> 42:01.584
It's Alexander Hamilton!

42:01.584 --> 42:02.834

42:05.834 --> 42:07.792
Lin Manuel...
what's up, I'm available.

42:07.792 --> 42:12.751
You look like you're gonna
cry or kill someone.

42:12.751 --> 42:15.876
I'm, like, so grumpy and over
people being grumpy and over.

42:15.876 --> 42:17.417
Oh.

42:17.417 --> 42:20.125
I put on my preference sheet
a million times,

42:20.125 --> 42:21.667
no cooked fish for me.

42:21.667 --> 42:23.417
No cooked fish of any sort,

42:23.417 --> 42:25.417
and she was like,
"Yeah, shellfish."

42:25.417 --> 42:32.626
Bloody ----ing sh--.

42:32.626 --> 42:34.292
I'm lost.

42:34.292 --> 42:35.542
Go down a deck and just
start going, caw caw, champagne.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.209
-Go down one?
-Go down one?

42:37.209 --> 42:39.667
Jesus Christ, we are
not even close

42:39.667 --> 42:42.834
to the Goddamn finish line.

42:42.834 --> 42:47.709
Either get your heads out of
your ass or I will eat your ass.

42:47.709 --> 42:50.584
Hey, Cap.

42:50.584 --> 42:51.918
No, no, no...

42:51.918 --> 42:53.667
Oh, something just went off.

42:53.667 --> 42:55.751
Oh, no.
Something happened.

42:55.751 --> 42:57.667
Yeah, it's something important.

42:57.667 --> 43:01.667
[bleep]
