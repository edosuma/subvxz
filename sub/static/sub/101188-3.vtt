WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.544
Oh, my God!
Why?! Why did you do this?!

00:02.628 --> 00:04.546
- I didn't mean to! You kept
telling me to pull harder!

00:04.630 --> 00:07.174
- I didn't mean to break me,
you dumb piece of shit!

00:07.257 --> 00:09.968
Now Dan is definitely
gonna know you snooped!

00:11.011 --> 00:12.679
- Did you...

00:12.763 --> 00:14.306
- What?

00:14.389 --> 00:15.807
- Did you fucking do that on purpose?

00:15.891 --> 00:17.851
- Wha...? Oh, my God, Cody.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.896
Why would I have you break me on purpose?

00:20.979 --> 00:22.564
So that Dan would come home from work

00:22.648 --> 00:24.107
and realize you're a crazy, jealous bitch

00:24.191 --> 00:27.110
and break up with you,
and then we'd live happily ever after?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.947
Yeah, I did it on purpose.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.949
- Well, great plan, man.
'Cause now you're all jacked up,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.576
so he might break up with me,
but he's gonna throw you away,

00:34.660 --> 00:35.869
so you fucked both of us.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.704
- Have you met Dan?
He doesn't care.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.915
For him, it's just another hole to fuck.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.634
You're seriously going
to all this trouble to keep Dan?

00:50.717 --> 00:51.844
Why?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.888
- 'Cause I love him?
- "Love him."

00:54.972 --> 00:57.099
How do you fucking know you love him?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.684
- I don't know, man, I ju...

00:58.767 --> 01:00.978
Like, I don't know,
we fart in front of each other.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.230
We... both like to watch movies
with the subtitles on.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.232
Whatever.
- Wow, wow, that sounds super deep.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.693
- Fuck off, Barbara.
You know, you call yourself a feminist,

01:07.776 --> 01:09.486
but you hate other women.
- What?

01:09.570 --> 01:10.904
No, I love other women.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.281
I just hate you.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.782
- But you are me!

01:13.866 --> 01:15.993
- No, I'm not.
I'm not you. Ugh!

01:17.244 --> 01:19.705
Phone, play "Doll Parts" by Hole.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.249
Yeah, I fucking love this song.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.876
- Okay, see?

01:23.959 --> 01:25.460
You just proved my point a-fucking-gain.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.880
We're the same person.
I love this song.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.798
You sound different to me,
'cause I'm going fucking crazy,

01:29.882 --> 01:31.550
but in reality I'm just sitting in my car,

01:31.633 --> 01:33.302
having a conversation with myself,
and I just told

01:33.385 --> 01:35.220
my phone to play "Doll Parts"
by Hole, so...

01:35.304 --> 01:37.306
Goddamn it.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.641
- You know what?
You are the shitty feminist.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.894
I hear you doing all types of,
like, rape roleplay,

01:41.977 --> 01:44.563
you twisted little bitch.
- Okay. That, you know...

01:44.646 --> 01:47.983
Roleplay, like... that's a consensual...

01:48.066 --> 01:51.028
And-and a woman can be submissive in bed

01:51.111 --> 01:54.948
and, like, not be, like...
- "Ooh, Daddy, it hurts!

01:55.032 --> 01:57.451
Daddy, I'm Cody. Ooh, it hurts."
- Okay.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.913
All right. When we do that,
it's, you know...

02:00.996 --> 02:03.957
it-it is a fictional roleplay universe...

02:04.041 --> 02:05.501
You know what, whatever, man.
It doesn't mean

02:05.584 --> 02:07.419
I want to fuck my real dad.
- Wow. Okay,

02:07.503 --> 02:09.838
I didn't actually think
you wanted to fuck your real dad

02:09.922 --> 02:11.757
until you just said that.
Now I'm like,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.967
oh, my God,
you want to fuck your real dad.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.636
Is he, like, hot or something?

02:15.719 --> 02:18.222
- You're so annoying.
- I'm annoying?

02:18.305 --> 02:20.891
Dan and I had a good thing going
and we were super happy,

02:20.974 --> 02:22.768
and you came
and you screwed everything up!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.436
Ugh! We all know you're just dating Dan

02:24.520 --> 02:26.021
because he's, like, a genius writer,

02:26.104 --> 02:27.856
and you're hoping
it'll somehow rub off on you.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.316
But it won't...

02:40.327 --> 02:41.828
I want a green juice.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.914
- Oh, that's too bad,
'cause you're plastic.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.083
- Your hands are clammy.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.001
Ow! You're hurting me!

02:48.085 --> 02:49.670
- Oh, no.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.172
- You're such, like, "mean mom" vibes.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.467
Oh, my God, Cody.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.345
Don't look now, but look now.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.972
Don't look now, but look now.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.139
The redhead.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.725
She's fucking disgusting. Ew.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.227
Girl, you're looking gorgeous.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.312
Keep rocking that wig.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.398
- Hello?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.109
- Bet he's totally
jerking it back there.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.986
- Who?
- The repairman.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.321
- How do you know it's not a repairwoman?

03:18.115 --> 03:20.659
You're so cute.
You're so, like, of the moment.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.787
I really am gonna miss you
when Dan breaks up with you.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.415
He's jerkin' off, he's jerkin' off.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.750
He's jerkin' off
in the back of the store.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.169
- Hey. Sorry about that.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.837
I hope you weren't waiting long.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.172
Did you hear anything?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.965
- See? I told you.
- Excuse me?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.509
- No, I was just in the back
making a repair to a doll, and I

03:37.593 --> 03:40.262
was wondering if you heard the
sound of me making the repairs.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.723
- See?
- Yeah, I didn't hear anything,
so, you know,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.767
for the future, like, you
don't have to ask that question.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.769
- Oh. A lesson learned.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.897
I am Stu.
How can I help you?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.441
- Yeah, I just need to get that fixed.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.277
- Yikes. That is nasty.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.820
- You're nasty, dicklick.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.363
- You know, actually,
I think it would be faster

03:58.447 --> 03:59.781
and cheaper just to get a new one.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.825
- What?
No, no, it's, um...

04:01.909 --> 04:04.203
it's my boyfriend's,
and he can't know about this,

04:04.286 --> 04:07.039
so, you know, it would have
to look exactly like her,

04:07.122 --> 04:10.667
and I know she's, like, a...
special one-of-a-kind order.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.087
- Wait, that one?
- Yeah.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.174
- No, no. That's a Kayla.
- A what?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.343
- That's a Kayla.
That's a standard midrange model.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.886
- That's not true.
- They discontinued those years ago

04:20.969 --> 04:23.180
due to lack of interest.
- No. He's a fucking liar.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.807
- Shame.
- I'll tell you what, we have
a bunch of 'em still in stock.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.643
Maybe you just get a new one.
They're on sale.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.145
- Great.
- What?
- Although...

04:30.229 --> 04:32.981
I'm just thinking about your situation.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.233
- What's wrong?

04:34.316 --> 04:35.609
- I don't know, it's just...

04:35.692 --> 04:37.486
she's really worn out.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.904
I think your boyfriend is

04:38.987 --> 04:40.280
definitely gonna notice the difference.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.782
Would you mind if I...?
- Please.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.325
- Okay, this is just...
- Great.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.493
- Ow!

04:44.576 --> 04:46.495
Okay, guys, my tits are chilly in here.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.497
If anyone happens to have a light cardie.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.040
- See, silicone isn't that different

04:50.123 --> 04:51.291
from flesh, really.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.252
Like, time just takes its toll.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.254
- Yeah.
- Look at these fingers
right here, can you see these?

04:55.337 --> 04:56.505
These are sort of...
- Oh, Jesus.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.965
- Yeah, they're kind of melty.
- Gross.
- Melty?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.883
No, no, no.
- Yeah, well, you know, this is the thing,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.094
they're only really designed
to last ten years,

05:02.177 --> 05:03.679
and so if you do the math, she's a MILF.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.973
- Fuck off, Stu.
- But...

05:06.056 --> 05:07.891
too old, too old to be a mother.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.560
So I guess, like, a GILF or something.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.854
- Okay, I'm actually unable to
conceive naturally, so the fact

05:11.937 --> 05:14.731
that you'd even bring that up
around me is very triggering.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.316
- Let me get serious here for a second.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.235
Let's take a look.
- Ew. What is he doing?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.279
- Okay.
- Oh, my God! Ew!
Get out of there, perv!

05:20.362 --> 05:23.657
- We got stage five vaginal stressing.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.076
- Okay, Cody, look, I know we
never established a safe word,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.453
and that is totally my bad--
we absolutely should have talked

05:28.537 --> 05:30.873
about it-- but, like: safe word.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.041
- Left labia completely blown out.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.419
- Okay, Cody, we can stop now.
- Now, the hair is easy,

05:35.502 --> 05:37.087
because we can just...
- I'm actually really starting
to freak out.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.422
Oh! My beautiful hair!

05:38.505 --> 05:40.883
- Yeah. Pops right off.
Easy peasy.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.302
Yeah, we just pop that on
to a new doll,

05:43.385 --> 05:45.470
'cause their wigs, they come
with a much higher quality

05:45.554 --> 05:48.098
of hair, and he would definitely
notice something like that.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.267
- Oh, Cody, please...

05:50.350 --> 05:51.894
- Right. Okay.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.896
- Now, take a look at the face here.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.480
See these cracks?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.608
These are called compression tears.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.401
They just happen over time.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.153
- Right.
- Look, I'm just

06:01.236 --> 06:03.780
spitballing here, but maybe
we can take a rolling chair,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.657
and we roll it over the face

06:05.741 --> 06:08.827
of the new one, back and forth
and back and forth, until...

06:08.911 --> 06:10.454
we can match this cracky face.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.289
But don't you think your boyfriend

06:12.372 --> 06:14.291
would prefer a new model?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.543
I mean... just look at her.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.338
She's useless.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.133
- Stu.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.260
Could you report to the loading dock?

06:25.344 --> 06:26.970
The new anuses just arrived.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.805
- Nice.
