00:01.035 --> 00:02.770
**

00:02.836 --> 00:05.873
Oh. You're here.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.343
Yes, it's my house.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.678
Now it's my turn.

00:10.744 --> 00:14.282
( British accent )
Oh. You're here.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.749
With good reason.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.719
Kendra and I are dropping your
little ones off at sleepovers.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.190
The least I can do
for allowing me
to live in your garage

00:22.256 --> 00:24.058
and marry your daughter --
all of it.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.759
Um...

00:25.826 --> 00:28.028
And just know --
I respect your boundaries,

00:28.096 --> 00:30.064
so please
pretend I'm invisible.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.932
( Normal voice )
I like that.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.068
But it's hard to pretend
you're invisible

00:34.135 --> 00:37.105
when I can still see you,
so...

00:37.171 --> 00:39.373
Ssst. Back a little it.
Yeah, there you go.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.775
Still got a little peripheral
on you. Right there.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.511
Yep, back, back.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.779
There you go.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.481
-Dad?
-Yeah.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.782
Oh! Dad.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.252
Okay, I cannot study up there.
This is ridiculous.

00:51.319 --> 00:54.021
I shouldn't have to
share a room
with my baby sister.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.324
It's torture.
Oh, come on,
it's not that bad, all right?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.458
Oh, it is.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.692
She's biting her fingernails

00:58.759 --> 01:00.661
and spitting them
into a Gatorade bottle.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.164
Okay.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.633
My Gatorade bottle.

01:05.699 --> 01:06.900
At least she's grooming,
all right?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.202
It's a step
in the right direction.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.470
Oh, come on, Dad.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.739
Why can't I just live
in the garage with Chale?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.040
I mean, we're engaged.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.509
Yeah, exactly, you're not
married yet -- if ever.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.877
My house, my rules.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.979
Fine, but we are going to
revisit this.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.982
Absolutely --
right after the wedding.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.884
And even then,
probably not.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.853
Dad.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.021
Love you.
Oh. Have fun tonight,
okay?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.990
I took $10
out of your wallet,

01:30.057 --> 01:31.692
but I told you,
so it's not stealing.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.029
I only took $5 'cause you --
you raised me right.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.565
Boom!

01:43.437 --> 01:45.906
There we go.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.376
There you are.
Nice.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.577
Okay.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.587
Oh. Ohh.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.821
Oh.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.075
( Door closes )
Donna: Hey, honey.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.177
Hey.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.981
Dug too deep in your
bread bowl again, didn't you?

02:28.048 --> 02:30.284
I did, yeah.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.119
The store
was a madhouse.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.254
Oh.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.822
What -- A slab of Brie?

02:34.888 --> 02:35.956
Yeah.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.758
Hey, honey,
you know my rule on cheeses.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.461
Yes -- "if it's not
individually wrapped,
forget that crap."

02:40.528 --> 02:42.463
Yes.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.732
But don't worry,
because it's not for you.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.301
I have my book club
coming over tonight.
It's gonna be fun.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.136
Wait a sec --
I got the guys tonight.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.372
No, go to Mott's house.
He's got a big place.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.873
Yeah,
he's also got seven kids,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.843
and the twins are usually
in a naked slap fight.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.145
Okay, well,
I'm not canceling.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.614
It's my first time hosting,
and I'm excited.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.749
Excited?
Yeah.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.517
Oh, let me see.
Baseball...

03:03.584 --> 03:04.785
book club.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.554
Ooh. Mm.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.721
Whoosh!

03:10.724 --> 03:15.563
* I am not your ordinary guy

03:15.629 --> 03:17.064
Announcer:
It's the bottom of the 8th...

03:17.130 --> 03:18.299
Sorry I'm late.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.402
My mother's foot veins
are flaring up again.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.238
Tell your mother to plop her
feet in a bucket of hot water

03:24.305 --> 03:25.306
for 10 minutes,

03:25.373 --> 03:27.675
then ice them,
then back to heat.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.778
I heard it was
ice, heat, ice.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.780
Heat, ice.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.415
Guys, guys, guys,
hey, do me a favor.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.683
Slow down
on this conversation,

03:35.749 --> 03:38.286
'cause I want to catch
all the de-- ( Snores )

03:39.987 --> 03:43.757
( Women laughing )

03:43.824 --> 03:45.326
What's going on
in there?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.528
Oh, Donna's
got her book club.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.797
I don't what they're doing,
but it sounds pretty wild.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.898
( Laughter continues )

03:50.964 --> 03:52.566
You know what?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.134
It's pretty wild in here,
too, okay, guys?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.336
I'm gonna get
some more chips.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.570
Let's focus on the game,
all right?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.038
Mets are only down by 9.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.374
Seriously.
Let's fix the mojo in here.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.611
Switch seats, stand up,
move around. Come on.

04:03.677 --> 04:07.448
No, I got this, I got this.
( Chanting "Chug!" )

04:07.515 --> 04:10.083
( Cheering, laughter )

04:10.150 --> 04:12.353
I'm sorry, honey.
Are we getting
too loud in here?

04:12.420 --> 04:14.688
Uh, no. Are we, uh --
we too loud out there?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.125
No, to be honest,
I didn't even know
you were still in there.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.461
Have there been people
in that room the whole night?

04:20.528 --> 04:23.263
Oh. Yeah,
it's off the chain!

04:23.331 --> 04:25.265
( Laughter )

04:29.370 --> 04:33.941
We moved. The Phillies scored.
We moved back.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.977
Come on, guys.
Motty! Shotgun!

04:37.044 --> 04:38.712
Yeah, get it.
What the hell?!

04:38.779 --> 04:40.948
Chug it, man!
I don't want to chug it!
You chipped it!

04:41.014 --> 04:42.249
I didn't chip it!
Chug it!

04:42.316 --> 04:44.652
No, you chipped it, guy!
Get him a towel!

04:44.718 --> 04:47.755
Ugh! Fine!

04:47.821 --> 04:48.822
( Laughter )

04:48.889 --> 04:50.123
Hey. Everything okay?

04:50.190 --> 04:52.360
Ohh. Yeah. You know what?
It's -- it's just great.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.227
Mott puked. We just hit
another level out here.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.329
Whoo!

05:00.701 --> 05:03.837
( Laughter continues )

05:09.543 --> 05:12.546
**

05:12.613 --> 05:14.114
( Chuckles )

05:14.181 --> 05:15.315
What's up?

05:15.383 --> 05:16.617
Oh, nothing.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.852
It's just something that
happened at the book club.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.521
Oh.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.424
( Giggles )

05:23.491 --> 05:25.158
What?

05:25.225 --> 05:26.760
Oh, we had something, too.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.497
Uh, Duffy was riffing
about his mom's foot veins.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.698
It was hilarious.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.001
You guys had ribs?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.636
Yeah, our book
had a Southern theme,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.104
so everyone
brought something.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.107
Gina brought Kentucky bourbon,
and Danielle brought biscuits,

05:40.173 --> 05:43.010
and Laura -- some pretty
racy stories from...

05:43.076 --> 05:44.978
the Bahamas!

05:45.045 --> 05:46.514
Was there any book reading
or...?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.115
Well, yeah,
we start with the book,

05:48.181 --> 05:50.250
but, you know,
the drinks flow, and then
before you know it,

05:50.317 --> 05:52.386
we're trying to sign Gina up
for whipped cream wrestling

05:52.453 --> 05:53.754
at a bar in Ronkonkoma.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.022
( Laughs )

05:55.088 --> 05:57.190
Which we all agreed
would be very irresponsible.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.427
So, this --
this happens every week?

05:59.493 --> 06:00.928
Well...yeah.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.996
Ever since we got rid
of this one girl, Tammi,

06:03.063 --> 06:04.197
this deadweight.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.099
All she would ever do
is talk about her cat.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.701
It's like "We get it,"
you know?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.703
"You didn't rescue her.
She rescued you."

06:09.770 --> 06:10.838
Total downer.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.142
Anyway -- Pbht!
Cut her loose.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.010
You just kicked her
out of the group?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.946
Yeah. Well, I mean, I didn't,
but Danielle did.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.415
But yeah,
they're not bringin' it,

06:21.482 --> 06:23.717
then they gots to go.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.785
Out!

06:24.852 --> 06:27.955
**

06:31.759 --> 06:33.226
( Rattling )
Waitress.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.229
How about
a couple more slices, huh?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.831
Does Mom know
you're eating this?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.500
Okay, you know what?
Do me a favor.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.301
Listen up, all right?

06:41.368 --> 06:44.304
This is where I hang out --
my safe place, all right?

06:44.371 --> 06:46.173
Now, when I got you
the job here,

06:46.239 --> 06:48.041
I laid down
a few rules and regs.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.276
You remember?
I do.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.178
Always
top off your drink.
Uh-huh.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.814
If you ask for regular cheese,
that means double cheese.
Right.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.316
"Double cheese"
means triple.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.453
And if Mom asks, you ate
something with carrots.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.654
There you go.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.722
And most important?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.323
If there's a pizza made
by mistake,

07:03.390 --> 07:04.925
you guys
get first crack at it.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.929
All right, boys,
you're probably wondering

07:08.996 --> 07:10.664
why I summonsed you here
today.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.201
Uh, not really.
We're here every day.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.571
True, but today's different
because I summonsed you.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.406
You texted us.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.974
It's a summons, guy.
It's a summons.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.409
Look, it doesn't matter.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.513
Anyway, last night was a real
eye-opener to me, all right?

07:25.579 --> 07:28.148
It really brings up
the question,

07:28.215 --> 07:30.417
is this
as good as it gets?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.085
I guess
if it had mushrooms

07:32.152 --> 07:35.022
and they burnt the crust
a little...

07:35.088 --> 07:37.558
Not the pizza.
I mean this -- life.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.692
I mean, come on.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.393
When we were on the force
and we'd talk

07:40.460 --> 07:42.930
about our dream retirement,
is this what we pictured?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.131
Kinda.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.299
I mean, every day
can't be the 4th of July.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.102
This is like July 5th.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.004
Hey, my aunt's birthday.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.372
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.341
Big man, focus, okay?

07:54.407 --> 07:56.143
Look, last night,

07:56.209 --> 07:59.346
six ladies in a book club
completely lapped us.

07:59.412 --> 08:03.083
A book club -- I'm gonna
let that sink in for a second.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.986
You want us
to start a book club?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.120
No.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.321
What I want you to do

08:08.388 --> 08:10.290
is I want you
to ask yourself a question --

08:10.357 --> 08:12.993
"What do I bring
to the table?"

08:13.060 --> 08:15.262
Seriously, Mott.
Tell me why you're an asset.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.499
Why do I want to be
in the Mott business?

08:19.567 --> 08:22.369
-Well, I'm honest.
-Mm-hmm.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.337
-I live close by.
-There you go.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.339
Oh, I think
my minivan's a plus.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.776
Wait, hold up.
You're evaluating us?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.678
Think about it. How do
baseball teams get better?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.012
They evaluate performance.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.048
This is just an informal --
yet permanent -- record

08:35.115 --> 08:37.117
of who's contributing what.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.252
-Why don't we evaluate you?
-Evaluate me?

08:39.319 --> 08:41.655
-Yeah.
-You know what? I already did.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.091
Insane leadership skills,
laser-focused,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.492
but with a playful side.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.328
The only negative --
I care too much.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.563
I care too much.
-You know what?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.699
You forgot something -- bully.
You're a bully.

08:51.765 --> 08:52.833
I'm out of here.
Yeah, me too.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.901
Oh. Okay.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.138
Mott, let's go!
You drove!

08:58.205 --> 09:01.441
**

09:01.508 --> 09:05.245
( Laughter )

09:05.312 --> 09:06.446
( Door opens )

09:07.681 --> 09:09.650
I'm right behind you.
Don't turn around.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.719
I'm just gonna use
the microwave.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.487
Chale.
I am still invisible.
Still invisible.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.224
Okay, it's okay.
You can use the microwave.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.893
And, by the way, you want to
sit down and...watch the game?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.094
You know,
there's no reason

09:21.161 --> 09:23.597
we shouldn't get to know
each other, really.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.299
My heart
wants to believe you, but...

09:28.201 --> 09:31.438
...my brain screams
that this is a trap.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.507
Chale, it's not a trap.
Come on, bud. Here.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.545
Oh. ( Laughs )

09:38.612 --> 09:41.081
You almost got me.
But not today!

09:41.148 --> 09:43.651
( Chuckles )

09:43.717 --> 09:46.386
( Laughter continues )

09:49.489 --> 09:51.424
See, that's
where the book loses me,

09:51.491 --> 09:53.526
because why would
a woman that educated

09:53.593 --> 09:56.363
stay with a guy
that stupid and self-centered?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.699
Don't answer that.
I'm in the room.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.400
( Laughter )

10:00.467 --> 10:03.904
I, uh...I made too much
of my special onion dip,

10:03.971 --> 10:06.039
so, uh,
you ladies have at it.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.574
I'm gonna head up, honey.
Yeah.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.676
Thank you.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.443
Wow!
This is insane!

10:10.510 --> 10:12.245
What's in this?
Uh, it's just --
you know,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.982
it's special herbs,
uh, sour cream,

10:15.048 --> 10:16.083
and another
secret ingredient

10:16.149 --> 10:17.317
I'm really
not at liberty to tell you.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.719
But I'm gonna --
it's Lipton onion soup.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.387
That's all it is.
( Laughter )

10:20.453 --> 10:22.022
It's the best.
( Chuckles )

10:22.089 --> 10:23.957
( Chuckles )
Okay, good night, honey.
Yeah, good night. Okay.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.059
Wait.
Kevin, you're a guy.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.896
Well, thank you.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.932
If you had to pick
between a slutty servant woman

10:31.999 --> 10:34.367
or an educated governess,

10:34.434 --> 10:37.237
who would you choose
to help you on a cattle drive?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.974
Ah,
that age-old question.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.777
Well, first, I would ask --
how long is the cattle drive?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.578
And second,
what's a guy got to do

10:45.645 --> 10:47.748
to get a glass of Merlot
around here, huh?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.149
( Laughter )

10:49.216 --> 10:50.918
We'll get you some
right now.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.286
( Laughs ) A little bit more,
a little bit more.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.255
Oh, okay. ( Laughs )

10:55.322 --> 10:58.525
Ooh, pretty bouquet.
I like it.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.626
**

10:59.693 --> 11:02.329
( Laughs )

11:02.395 --> 11:03.997
What's so funny?

11:04.064 --> 11:06.099
I was just
thinking about Steph.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.667
When she was ragging
on her husband

11:07.735 --> 11:10.603
for wearing the skinny jeans,
I -- I was literally crying.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.739
I was crying.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.606
Well, I'm glad
you enjoyed yourself.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.876
You know, we've never really
had a husband join us

11:15.943 --> 11:19.747
and then stay
until the very, very end.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.783
Anyway, thanks
for letting me hang out.
No problem.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.518
Next week, I promise --
I'm gonna blend in.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.788
Next week?

11:29.156 --> 11:31.624
Uh, honey, is there something
going on with the guys

11:31.691 --> 11:33.360
that I don't know about?

11:33.426 --> 11:34.762
The guys?
Yeah.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.330
You mean the weak links
weighing me down?

11:37.397 --> 11:40.333
Hm, they hads to go.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.902
( Cellphone chimes )
Ooh.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.472
"No, Nancy,
you're the best."

11:45.538 --> 11:49.442
Smiley face, smiley face
with glasses, dynamite.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.678
**

11:54.982 --> 11:56.884
( Laughter )

11:56.950 --> 11:58.318
Hey.
Where's the food, man?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.387
I got a bunch of hungry ladies
out there.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's got to sit for a minute.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.492
Nothing worse
than runny lasagna.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.238
So, uh, there any, uh,
single ladies in this club?

12:18.305 --> 12:21.241
Hey, this is
about literature, okay?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.243
Can't hook up
your own brother?

12:23.310 --> 12:25.245
Do you know that I'm on call
at the firehouse right now?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.513
I'm doing this
as a favor.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.449
I can't. I'm -- I'm --
I'm a newbie myself.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.351
I've only been there
a few weeks.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.220
I'll tell you what.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.023
I'll float your name out there
and see how it washes out.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.524
All right?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.092
I'm gonna start them
with this.
Okay.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.794
Here you go, ladies.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.798
I thought everybody
would enjoy a little cru-dite.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.267
That's just a fancy way
of saying "raw vegetables."

12:47.334 --> 12:48.836
It's "crudite."

12:48.902 --> 12:50.237
Ohh!

12:50.303 --> 12:53.673
French language police
are here. Take me away.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.845
I'm kidding.
You're my Yoda, Gina.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.012
You know you are.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.248
I think
someone's looking for you.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.755
What are you doing, man?
What do you want?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.123
Nothing.
Just, uh, you know...

13:10.190 --> 13:11.491
the one in the chair
over there is kind of cute.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.126
She just gave me the eye.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.929
That's 'cause she hasn't seen
a handlebar mustache
since 1974.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.568
Sorry about that.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.003
No, it's okay,
but we should probably

13:23.070 --> 13:24.304
start talking
about the book now.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.572
Oh, before we do,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.740
I just want to thank you
ladies for embracing me.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.844
I know being here is not
a right. It's a privilege.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.579
And I know that everybody's
got to step up their --

13:32.645 --> 13:34.114
No, you don't have to step up,
honey.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.949
You just sit there
and, um...

13:36.016 --> 13:38.251
Just sit there.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.519
No,
I think what I bring --

13:39.586 --> 13:41.688
and I think what you ladies
have latched onto --

13:41.754 --> 13:44.057
is a male perspective,
right?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.959
And I'm not saying
"The Honeybee
and the Looking Glass"

13:46.026 --> 13:47.127
isn't a great book.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.230
But what do you say
we throw a "curveball"

13:50.297 --> 13:52.832
and ignite this party...

13:52.900 --> 13:55.435
with "The Drew Ott Story"?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.205
"This shortstop played more
minor league baseball games

13:58.271 --> 13:59.672
than anyone in history,

13:59.739 --> 14:02.642
but on the day he finally gets
called up to the big leagues,

14:02.709 --> 14:05.678
tragedy strikes...him out."

14:07.380 --> 14:11.551
I'm not sure that's something
we'd...want to read.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.287
Danielle, we all know you have
a problem with commitment.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.289
Don't miss the boat
on this one,
like you did with Tyler.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.693
Somebody had to say it.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.696
Y'all we're thinking it.
Y'all we're thinking it.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.199
Honey, I feel like
now would be a great time

14:26.266 --> 14:28.501
to get those
broccoli pinwheels started.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.337
Honey,
I'm in the middle --
No, that's okay.
I'll help you.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.838
Okay, fine.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.576
Look, I know you think
it's a book about baseball,

14:36.643 --> 14:37.677
but it's not.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.612
It's about life.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.282
Honey,
you're out of the club.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.383
What?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.517
I'm sorry.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.154
You gots to go.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.591
But everybody loves me.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.627
Well, everybody loved it
when you came the first night,

14:54.694 --> 14:55.828
but...

14:55.895 --> 14:58.131
See, babe, you're like
triple-chocolate cake.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.732
You know, it's great
the first time,

14:59.799 --> 15:01.268
but you can't eat it
every night.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.004
That's not
a good analogy for me.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.438
Right.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.906
Okay.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.177
Sweetheart...
it's a girls club, you know?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.212
And I know that something
happened with your friends,

15:12.279 --> 15:16.349
but you got work that out,
because book club is my time.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
Ohhhh.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.286
I see it. Okay.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.721
You're jealous 'cause
I'm fitting in too well.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.091
I'm -- I'm stealing
your thunder.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.326
All right, I got it.
No, I --

15:26.393 --> 15:28.661
I'm not the only one
that feels this way.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.664
So, you're saying your friends
want me out of the group?

15:31.731 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.267
Wow.

15:34.334 --> 15:38.505
Wow, this is sad.
This is so, so sad.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.207
Sad?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.009
Allow me to show you a text,
would you?
Okay.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.110
Okay?
Yeah.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.277
Here we go. Ready?
Okay.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.746
Me -- "See you Tuesday night,
Lisa."

15:46.813 --> 15:49.149
Her response --
"Sounds good, Kev."

15:49.216 --> 15:52.052
"Sounds good, Kev."
Mm-hmm. Okay.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.988
Well,
this is from Nancy.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.257
"If we have book club
at my house,

15:57.324 --> 15:59.993
do you think
Kevin will show up?"

16:00.060 --> 16:02.262
Okay, see, it's all
how you're reading it,
'cause I see it as,

16:02.329 --> 16:05.098
( Excitedly ) "Do you think
Kevin will show up?"

16:05.165 --> 16:06.266
Uh-huh. All right.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.701
Well, this one --
it's not even a text.

16:08.768 --> 16:13.140
It's just a picture of you
with the word
"out" underneath.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.843
She took my head and put it
on the body of a manatee.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.847
I'm sorry, honey.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.849
Wow.
I guess that's it.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.084
( Sighing ) Yeah.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.119
So, you think I should
finish out the night or...?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.520
Uh...

16:27.587 --> 16:28.855
no.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.898
Ladies, it's been
brought to my attention

16:38.965 --> 16:41.268
that I may not be
your cup of tea.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.439
Some of you consider me
even a little pushy,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.475
with the body of a manatee.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.612
So, I guess
this is goodbye.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.715
Annie, I told you things
I've never told
another human being.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.819
Cake balls
are in the freezer,

16:59.886 --> 17:02.622
and the Merlot should probably
breathe for a few minutes

17:02.689 --> 17:03.756
before serving.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.859
( Chuckles )

17:13.700 --> 17:16.769
No one's gonna stop you,
hon.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.373
**

17:20.440 --> 17:21.474
Yes!

17:21.541 --> 17:23.143
All we do
is play Cornhole.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.378
Aren't you guys
about Cornholed out?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.380
What about stickball?
Stickball?

17:27.447 --> 17:30.983
What are we -- 12-year-olds
in the Great Depression?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.553
Stop looking at him.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.055
Dad,
just go talk to them.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.257
Talk to who?

17:37.324 --> 17:38.891
The three old dudes
playing with beanbags

17:38.958 --> 17:41.494
pretending not to notice you
for the last two hours.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.363
They need to apologize to me,
all right?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.398
All I was doing was trying
to make our lives better.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.966
Yeah, that worked.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.371
He just looked at us.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.672
Well, let's
just talk to him.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.941
No, no, no.
If we blink first, he wins.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.476
All right, somebody ordered
a large pepperoni

17:56.543 --> 17:57.944
and never picked it up,

17:58.010 --> 18:02.615
and according to your rule,
you guys get
first crack at it.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.266
I'm grabbing
a slice.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.633
Stay strong.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.636
This is stupid,
all right?

18:23.703 --> 18:26.739
We can call a truce --
at least until
we finish the pizza.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.113
Go ahead.
You can have that one.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.982
I know how much you like
the burnt crust.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.887
Did you remember that
about me,
or was it in my file?

18:43.089 --> 18:45.225
It's in here...

18:45.292 --> 18:47.059
and it's in here.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.283
Classy move, kid.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.851
Thanks, Enzo.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.854
You know I got to make you
pay for that
large pepperoni, right?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.289
Yeah, I know.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.926
( Clears throat ) I mean now.
I'm counting out the drawer.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.528
**

19:25.064 --> 19:26.132
**

19:26.199 --> 19:27.967
Hey, Dad.
Whatcha doing?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.602
Watching a movie.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.204
You want to watch?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.305
Yeah.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.373
( Chuckles )

19:33.440 --> 19:35.174
How are you, kiddo?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.776
I'm okay.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.110
But I missed you,
you know?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.712
Sometimes I miss Mom.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.215
But today --
today's a Dad day.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.650
( Chuckles )

19:43.716 --> 19:44.917
So sweet.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.253
How was school?

19:46.319 --> 19:47.720
It was good.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.357
Actually, might get a call
from the vice principal

19:50.423 --> 19:53.059
with a very one-sided story
about a small food fight

19:53.125 --> 19:55.862
that I was accused
of starting.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.265
He already called.
You're grounded for a week.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.868
Well, I guess
there's no reason
to do this anymore.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.770
No, probably not.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.375
( Inhales sharply )
You know, uh, Mr. Gable,

20:08.441 --> 20:11.143
I was thinking about
your offer to
watch TV with you

20:11.210 --> 20:12.412
the other day.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.314
And, uh, you're right.

20:14.381 --> 20:18.685
There's really no reason
that we can't get
to know each other.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.753
Yeah, I worked things out
with my buddies. You're out.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.422
Oh. Fair enough.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.691
**

20:24.757 --> 20:28.060
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:28.127 --> 20:31.598
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:31.664 --> 20:33.800
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:33.866 --> 20:35.335
* Do, do, do, do

20:35.402 --> 20:38.938
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:39.005 --> 20:42.008
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:42.074 --> 20:44.644
* I just don't want no...
