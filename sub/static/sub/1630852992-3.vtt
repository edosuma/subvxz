WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:09.426
It's in to Kareem.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.596
Kareem swings left.
Right hand… Twelve-footer. Good!

00:12.679 --> 00:16.642
The new king of scoring
has ascended his throne.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.560
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the NBA record

00:18.644 --> 00:20.229
for the Most Valuable Player Award.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.855
NBA Rookie of the Year,

00:21.939 --> 00:24.983
number one all-time playoff scorer,
eight times a first team all-star.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.693
Kareem with a big pressure shot!

00:26.777 --> 00:30.322
The game's
most heralded big man, Lew Alcindor.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.325
Everyone knows you
from the world of sports,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.786
but a lot of people don't know
what it was like

00:35.869 --> 00:38.539
to be a sportsman during your time.

00:41.458 --> 00:46.129
As I got to see
the Civil Rights Movement unfold,

00:46.213 --> 00:49.800
there were very few Black people that
didn't wanna do whatever they could do

00:49.883 --> 00:50.926
to help the movement.

00:52.427 --> 00:56.098
All the benefits of American society
has been denied to us,

00:56.181 --> 00:59.184
and that has to be changed.

00:59.268 --> 01:03.063
As an athlete,
we are able to use our platform

01:03.146 --> 01:05.440
to help people see what's going on.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.818
- Dear Kareem…
- Dear Kareem…

01:07.901 --> 01:10.445
You first inspired me through basketball,

01:10.529 --> 01:12.739
but later, you ended up
showing me the importance

01:12.823 --> 01:14.283
of giving back to my community.

01:14.867 --> 01:18.203
Because of your tenacity,
I know that someone like me,

01:18.287 --> 01:21.915
a brown boy from the projects,
can make an impact on American history.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.170
I would tell any young athlete
that is trying to use his voice,

01:26.253 --> 01:31.884
"Just make sure that what you say
is true and heartfelt."

01:31.967 --> 01:33.343
Dear Kareem…

01:57.910 --> 02:00.120
Skyhook, up and good.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.831
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
has given the Los Angeles Lakers…

02:02.915 --> 02:05.375
I don't remember a time
when I wasn't tall.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.253
Growing up, that was all people saw.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.634
And at a later point in my life,
people would tell me all the time,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.552
was, "Yeah, well, you know, you're tall.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.472
And so that's why you were successful."

02:18.555 --> 02:20.807
It started to annoy me, you know.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.686
My senior year at UCLA,

02:24.770 --> 02:28.607
there were 70 other players
listed at seven feet tall.

02:29.233 --> 02:34.363
Seventy. And I don't think
anybody can name any of 'em.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.114
So, you know, it's not just about height.

02:37.366 --> 02:42.746
It's about the hard work that you put in
and your competitive zeal, you know.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.665
And that's what makes champions.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.129
I grew up in the Dyckman Street projects
in Harlem.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.091
It was like looking at the world,
you know.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.635
There were people there
from all over the world.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.514
There was a Russian immigrant
that lived directly above me,

03:00.597 --> 03:02.391
and a rabbi lived in our building.

03:02.474 --> 03:06.603
People from the Caribbean and China.
It was amazing.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.232
It helped me understand
that the world is a very big place.

03:11.984 --> 03:16.738
My father was a police officer,
and my mom was a seamstress.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.700
They were just trying
to break into the middle class there.

03:20.284 --> 03:24.121
They instilled it in me that
an education is the key to success.

03:25.664 --> 03:29.084
I remember I didn't have
a very good game in grade school.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.713
Awkwardness, that was, my game, you know.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.050
But my grade school coach
gave me a drill to do

03:37.134 --> 03:38.677
that showed me how to shoot the hook shot.

03:38.760 --> 03:43.473
And that foundation evolved
into what people call the skyhook.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.435
Kareem to the skyhook. And good!

03:46.935 --> 03:49.938
It was a tool that I learned
how to use effectively that early.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.940
Kareem hits again with a skyhook.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.776
Prettiest shot that basketball
has ever known.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.070
It really helped me start to learn

03:57.154 --> 03:59.323
how a big man's supposed to play the game,

03:59.406 --> 04:03.493
and I got to the point where I dunked
a basketball during a game.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.291
So, I knew that I had some skills.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.462
As I got older, Power Memorial High School

04:13.545 --> 04:16.089
was really interested
in giving me a scholarship.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.218
And people had to pay tuition
to go to Power.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.262
It was hard for me to believe,
but all of a sudden,

04:22.346 --> 04:24.973
basketball was paying bills.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.565
I started seeing professional
basketball at that time,

04:33.649 --> 04:37.444
and I tried to emulate Bill Russell
on the defensive end

04:38.278 --> 04:40.280
and Wilt Chamberlain on the offensive end.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.327
You know, I realized that my advantages,
my height and agility,

04:45.410 --> 04:48.830
were something that I could use
to dominate the game.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.963
We won 70-odd games
between my freshman and senior year.

04:56.630 --> 05:01.927
We still are recognized as the best
high school team of the 20th century.

05:02.511 --> 05:07.140
That's pretty good.
I'll take that anytime.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.395
You know,
I was a basketball star in New York City,

05:11.478 --> 05:14.356
but, you know, I had to be
an adolescent and a young man.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.026
And the Harlem Youth Project
was a mentoring program.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.656
And it really helped me
understand who I was

05:22.739 --> 05:25.909
with regard to my culture
and my background.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.121
I had always been interested
in literature and writing,

05:29.204 --> 05:30.789
and journalism.

05:30.873 --> 05:34.418
And I was able to get
a spot on the journalism workshop.

05:35.586 --> 05:39.631
During the summer of 1964,
Dr. Martin Luther King came

05:39.715 --> 05:44.845
and addressed the participants
in the Harlem Youth Unlimited Program.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.181
And because
I was in a journalism workshop,

05:47.264 --> 05:51.560
they gave me press credentials,
and I covered the event for our paper.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.857
At the time,
Black Americans were fighting basically

05:56.940 --> 05:59.109
for the recognition of their humanity.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.945
And, you know,
I was really badly affected

06:02.029 --> 06:04.573
when the four girls were killed
in Birmingham.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.075
What did they do? You know,

06:07.159 --> 06:10.287
it was things like that that really
make your blood boil.

06:11.205 --> 06:16.168
And so there was a debate about how
Black Americans could best effect change.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.797
Young people wanted to meet the violence
with violence,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.674
and I wanted to strike back.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.054
But Dr. King
was an advocate of nonviolence.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.351
You know,
I would measure one against the other,

06:32.434 --> 06:35.187
and after seeing Dr. King
and his demeanor,

06:35.270 --> 06:39.942
I really saw the wisdom
of Dr. King's approach.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.528
He finally won me over.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.281
I saw how the nonviolent approach

06:46.365 --> 06:48.659
was really the only way
that we could be successful.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.995
I'm more convinced than ever before

06:52.079 --> 06:56.750
that violence creates many more
social problems than it solves.

06:57.626 --> 07:02.840
Through nonviolence,
we can move into that brighter day.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.093
That summer, especially that day,
you know, more or less,

07:06.176 --> 07:07.928
it's affected my life.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.346
Ever since then, you know,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.766
because of how I could relate
to what Dr. King was all about.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.367
Dear Kareem,

07:30.450 --> 07:34.288
I was a young kid from East Harlem
when I met you for the first time.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.832
"Back then, you were Lew Alcindor,

07:36.915 --> 07:40.169
and you used to play basketball
and hang out with my older brother, Al."

07:40.252 --> 07:43.964
My brother was responsible for teaching me
my early basketball skills.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.383
And he talked about you so often,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.761
I just thought you were the most
fantastic person that I ever knew,

07:49.845 --> 07:51.305
even before I met you.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.725
It was the summer
before my freshman year of high school.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.395
I had gotten a basketball scholarship
to Power Memorial.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.315
You had just finished your freshman year
at UCLA,

08:01.398 --> 08:03.567
and you were running
a free basketball clinic

08:03.650 --> 08:05.110
with some of the New York Knicks

08:05.194 --> 08:07.613
in the public housing project
where I lived.

08:07.696 --> 08:11.033
I wore my Power Memorial shirt
so that you would notice me,

08:11.116 --> 08:12.576
and it worked.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.703
There was an instant connection.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.873
I followed you
to two other clinics that summer,

08:17.956 --> 08:20.542
and you'd always single me out for drills.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.755
As small as it seems,
I really needed that positive attention.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.757
I don't know how my life
would have turned out…

08:26.840 --> 08:30.135
"…if I hadn't had someone like you
take an interest in me."

08:30.886 --> 08:35.557
I wanted to follow the inspirational role
you had created at Power Memorial

08:35.640 --> 08:38.059
to do whatever I could to emulate you.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.938
My basketball coach
had been your assistant coach,

08:42.022 --> 08:46.193
and he always told me how hard you worked
on your skills during your time at Power.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.947
I made it my goal
to work just as hard as you.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.201
By my senior year, my high school team
was ranked number one in the country,

08:54.284 --> 08:56.995
and I was chosen as the league's
Player of the Year.

08:58.664 --> 09:02.584
My name was engraved
on a plaque right under your name.

09:02.668 --> 09:06.797
That was my proudest moment.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.883
I received
over 100 basketball scholarship offers,

09:09.967 --> 09:13.011
and ended up going
to the University of Maryland.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.930
I would see you now and then when…

09:15.013 --> 09:18.100
"…you'd come through Baltimore,
playing for the Milwaukee Bucks.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.644
You always had words
of encouragement for me."

09:20.727 --> 09:26.024
I thought I was on the path to go pro
until I hurt my knee in my junior year

09:26.108 --> 09:27.734
and had to have surgery.

09:27.818 --> 09:33.574
The next time I saw you, you said to me,
"Basketball isn't everything.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.076
Be the best that you can be
in whatever you do."

09:37.744 --> 09:42.040
After you told me this,
I shifted my focus away from basketball

09:42.124 --> 09:44.710
and went on to pursue
various professional careers.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.921
In the mid-'90s, we reconnected.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.675
I was working for a footwear company,
and you had retired from the Lakers,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.970
and you were running a charity program
called "Kareem's Kids."

09:55.971 --> 09:59.892
I thought, "If Kareem is doing this,
I wanna do it too."

10:00.934 --> 10:04.730
When you said to me,
"Create my own destiny,"

10:04.813 --> 10:06.273
I knew what I needed to do.

10:09.651 --> 10:13.572
Your charity work inspired me to create
a community program at my company

10:13.655 --> 10:15.240
called "Operation Rebound,"

10:15.324 --> 10:18.785
where we partnered
with different celebrities and athletes

10:18.869 --> 10:23.832
and traveled to schools across the country
to have open dialogue with teenagers

10:23.916 --> 10:28.504
about what's actually on their minds
and what's happening in their lives.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.964
The response was phenomenal.

10:31.048 --> 10:34.176
Teenagers generally
don't wanna talk to their parents,

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
but they did want to talk to us.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.432
Later, when I went to work
at a TV station in Baltimore,

10:40.516 --> 10:44.645
I decided to create a community initiative
called "For Our Teens,"

10:44.728 --> 10:48.148
featuring a series of vignettes
on different teen-related issues

10:48.232 --> 10:52.069
where kids could come
and share whatever was on their minds.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.947
The program was nominated
for a community service Emmy.

10:56.073 --> 11:00.327
Kareem, my entire life,
I've thought of you as a mentor.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.121
The times we've gotten together
through the years,

11:03.205 --> 11:06.834
as short as they've been,
have left a lasting impression.

11:07.626 --> 11:11.088
Out of all the true American heroes
alive today,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.632
in my mind, you are number one.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.261
Thanks for making this kid
from East Harlem feel special,

11:17.344 --> 11:21.014
and for showing me the importance
of giving back to my community.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.309
Your Power Memorial little brother, Jap.

11:24.810 --> 11:28.397
Here is the seventh annual
all-American high school basketball team.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.109
Seven-foot, quarter-inch Lew Alcindor,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.444
who reminds everybody of Wilt Chamberlain.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.613
Here they are.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.616
As we had more and more success,

11:39.700 --> 11:44.746
I started to get letters from colleges
that were offering me scholarships.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.916
Well, it got to the point
where our coach said that,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.002
"You've got plenty of letters here.

11:50.085 --> 11:53.672
You can go to any school that offers
a basketball scholarship.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.965
They'll take you."

11:55.632 --> 11:58.927
I wanted to get a degree.
That was a goal of mine.

11:59.011 --> 12:02.723
And all of a sudden, I realized that,
you know, my dreams were coming true.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.310
It was-- It was quite an experience.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.938
You know, I identified UCLA early on,

12:10.022 --> 12:14.193
and, you know, I got a letter
from one of my heroes, Jackie Robinson.

12:15.485 --> 12:19.990
He went to UCLA, and he said that
it was a good place to go to school.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.952
And that more or less
sealed the deal for me.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.289
In Los Angeles,
collegiate basketball's newest superstar,

12:27.372 --> 12:31.502
UCLA's Lew Alcindor,
warms up for his first varsity game.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.254
Coming to Los Angeles as a young man,
you know,

12:34.338 --> 12:36.798
you don't know
what your future's gonna be,

12:36.882 --> 12:41.887
but the first opportunity I had,
our team was successful.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.349
The Bruins' superstar,
towering Lew Alcindor,

12:45.432 --> 12:49.061
caps a brilliant season
with another dazzling scoring exhibition.

12:50.771 --> 12:55.025
To be 20 years old,
and to have won the NCAA championship

12:55.108 --> 12:56.401
was a great feeling.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.778
And we were undefeated.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.031
It really was educational for me to see

13:01.114 --> 13:04.618
how hard work and perseverance
can take you a very long way.

13:05.369 --> 13:10.082
Then the following year,
the NCAA outlawed the dunk because of me.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.960
They said that it wasn't because of me.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.548
I think so. But we'll never know.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.510
And of course,
it didn't limit my effectiveness.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.137
The Bruins did what no team
had done before.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.266
They won three consecutive
national championships.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.143
Think it just took something
away from the fans, so…

13:30.227 --> 13:32.271
People seem to resent
other people's success.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.857
It's too bad, you know.

13:38.443 --> 13:43.532
While I was at UCLA, I was able to explore
a whole lot of different areas of study,

13:43.615 --> 13:47.411
and you know, I got deeper
into what was happening politically.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.499
For example,
it took a while before people realized

13:52.583 --> 13:54.585
that we didn't need to go to Vietnam.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.629
Mr. Muhammad Ali
has just refused to be inducted

13:57.713 --> 13:59.715
into the United States Armed Forces.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.469
It's always tough to be the first.
You can't get any help, you know.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.014
Muhammad Ali was out there by himself.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.765
He faces federal prosecution

14:08.849 --> 14:12.477
and a possible five-year prison sentence,
plus $10,000 fine.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.439
I had a quiet personality,

14:16.106 --> 14:18.317
but I felt that I had to do something.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.196
Nine top Negro athletes
meet with Cassius Clay

14:22.279 --> 14:24.573
to discuss his anti-draft stand.

14:24.656 --> 14:29.453
They include Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor
and former pro footballer, Jimmy Brown.

14:31.330 --> 14:35.501
What America's all about is
people speaking out against injustice.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.045
We have to explain what's going on

14:38.128 --> 14:39.505
so that people can understand

14:39.588 --> 14:43.008
what Black Americans have
to contend with here in America.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.762
Dr. Martin Luther King,

14:46.845 --> 14:49.932
the apostle of nonviolence
in the Civil Rights Movement,

14:50.015 --> 14:52.518
has been shot to death
in Memphis, Tennessee.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.437
The assassination
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

14:55.521 --> 14:58.398
was devastating for Black Americans.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.319
And I demonstrated on campus.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.656
We just did a silent demonstration.

15:07.366 --> 15:11.370
But while I was demonstrating,
people would come up to me, and said,

15:11.453 --> 15:13.121
"You're gonna get a chance
to play in the NBA,

15:13.205 --> 15:14.873
what are you protesting about?"

15:15.541 --> 15:20.879
And it was as if the opportunity
to be a professional athlete

15:20.963 --> 15:24.550
means that you've gotten a reward
that they haven't gotten,

15:24.633 --> 15:27.719
so you should deal with abuse.

15:27.803 --> 15:31.265
And I'm not supposed to protest
the assassination

15:31.348 --> 15:34.893
of a peaceful man
who was fighting for our rights.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.939
And, you know, that kind of annoyed me,

15:39.022 --> 15:42.484
and it made it very difficult
for me to feel enthusiastic

15:42.568 --> 15:44.069
about going to the Olympics.

15:44.653 --> 15:48.031
A number of Negro athletes said that,
to them,

15:48.115 --> 15:51.243
this country
is more important than their race,

15:51.326 --> 15:52.870
and they would like to participate.

15:52.953 --> 15:56.915
Do statements like that
make you lean in their direction?

15:56.999 --> 16:00.836
Well, I can't lean in their direction
'cause I can only speak for myself.

16:00.919 --> 16:04.339
If you're in a racist society,

16:05.090 --> 16:06.717
and you're being discriminated against,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.427
it's up to you to do something
for yourself.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.971
I didn't go. I just--

16:11.054 --> 16:14.057
My heart wasn't in it.
But there was backlash.

16:14.141 --> 16:18.937
I do question the type
of negative repercussions that may arise.

16:19.438 --> 16:23.066
People got annoyed at me
'cause I supported Muhammad Ali

16:23.150 --> 16:27.779
and had these thoughts about
what was happening in America.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.324
They were just being naive about

16:30.407 --> 16:33.577
how racism affects
the lives of Black Americans.

16:35.704 --> 16:40.125
But some people, you know,
don't like you speaking your truth.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.134
Dear Kareem,

16:49.218 --> 16:52.971
Right then and there,
I knew who I was, who I had to be.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.141
"I was going to be Black rage personified,

16:56.225 --> 16:58.352
Black power in the flesh."

16:58.435 --> 17:02.105
You said those words
when you were just 20 years old.

17:02.689 --> 17:06.693
You were a major influence in my journey
to discovering my purpose, Kareem.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.070
My name is Lauren A. Jones,

17:09.154 --> 17:11.698
and let's just say our paths have crossed

17:11.781 --> 17:14.451
in some interesting
and unconventional ways.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.663
I'm an LA native, born and raised.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.582
Many of my close friends and family
are athletes,

17:20.665 --> 17:24.545
so I've always been personally invested
in issues that are important to them.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.714
There are times
that I've been disappointed

17:27.798 --> 17:31.677
in the way that media has portrayed
Black athletes as one-dimensional.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.639
"I'm sure you've heard the phrase,
'Shut up and dribble.'"

17:35.722 --> 17:40.477
I have this powerful, visceral reaction.
A conviction even.

17:40.561 --> 17:44.481
Athletes should have the right
to stand up against social injustice.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.150
This has been your battle cry for decades,

17:47.234 --> 17:51.405
and sadly it still resonates now
just as strongly as it did then.

17:51.947 --> 17:55.617
You inspired me to follow my passion
of sports journalism.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.120
I committed myself to becoming
one of the industry's

17:58.203 --> 18:00.497
most respected sports journalists.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.667
I was so intimidated.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.629
I was, and still am, one of the only Black
women journalists

18:07.713 --> 18:09.256
in the Lakers locker room.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.302
Half the battle at first
was earning the players' trust.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.763
They have to keep their guard up
both on and off the court.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.558
Many people seek to sensationalize them,

18:19.641 --> 18:21.727
and a mishandled story in the press

18:21.810 --> 18:25.230
could have serious personal
and professional consequences.

18:25.731 --> 18:30.194
I worked hard to establish
that I wasn't that type of journalist.

18:31.445 --> 18:34.531
I'll never forget the day we met
on the floor of the STAPLES Center.

18:34.615 --> 18:35.657
Do you remember?

18:35.741 --> 18:39.036
There you were. You smiled a mile wide.

18:39.119 --> 18:43.999
And from there, every time you saw me,
you met me with the same glow and…

18:44.082 --> 18:46.835
"Hello, young lady. How are you doing?"

18:46.919 --> 18:48.587
You saw me.

18:48.670 --> 18:53.050
You, a Lakers legend,
and one of my personal inspirations.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.053
In a way,
meeting you at the STAPLES Center

18:56.136 --> 18:58.847
was the proof
that I'm on the right course.

18:58.931 --> 19:03.393
A simple acknowledgment from you
was enough to say, "I do belong here."

19:06.605 --> 19:09.650
Every year in basketball,
excellent players come along.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.445
But a player of the caliber
of Lew Alcindor

19:13.529 --> 19:15.489
probably does not come along every year.

19:15.572 --> 19:20.452
I would say the Milwaukee Bucks will be
prepared to meet the competitive market.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.704
The success that I enjoyed

19:22.788 --> 19:25.874
enabled me to say
that I was the best at what I did,

19:25.958 --> 19:29.336
and I was able to get
a great contract as a rookie.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.004
And I wouldn't have done that

19:31.088 --> 19:34.174
if there was any question
that I couldn't deliver.

19:34.258 --> 19:36.510
So, that's what I did.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.099
There you see number 33, Lew.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.601
This is his first
professional basketball game.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.688
And this is the moment
we have been waiting for.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.273
His first shot.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.610
Playing in Milwaukee was a lot of fun.

19:54.987 --> 19:58.782
I wanted to go and see what I could do,
playing against the best.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.451
Lew Alcindor inside against Chamberlain.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.495
…back doors.
Comes back with the right hand.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.747
And the Milwaukee Bucks
have won their 16th in a row.

20:05.831 --> 20:06.999
And the team that was in the cellar

20:07.082 --> 20:09.835
are looking forward
toward a playoff this year.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.628
What a difference one player makes.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.633
You know,
I felt that I had to prove myself.

20:16.717 --> 20:17.718
Down into the hole to Lew.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.928
Turnaround skyhook from six. It's good!

20:20.012 --> 20:23.682
Alcindor, with 44 points, has done it all.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.517
It's over, it's over!

20:25.601 --> 20:28.478
The Milwaukee Bucks
are champions of the world!

20:28.562 --> 20:31.356
The Milwaukee Bucks
are the world champions!

20:32.649 --> 20:35.277
After we won
the first world championship in 1971,

20:35.360 --> 20:38.113
I changed my name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.866
You changed your name
and took on a religion,

20:40.949 --> 20:45.037
at a time when people weren't too generous
in their understanding of that.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.872
What were you thinking at that time?

20:47.664 --> 20:48.999
I had been a Muslim

20:49.082 --> 20:52.044
for something like three years
before I changed my name.

20:52.127 --> 20:55.839
And I changed it
when I realized that this is who I was

20:55.923 --> 20:58.425
and that my faith
had the most important meaning to me.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.929
People are gonna have to learn
how to deal with those things

21:02.012 --> 21:06.183
because the world is too big
to be that narrow-minded about anything.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.521
This country is trying to evolve.

21:10.604 --> 21:14.024
And my own life, really,
has taught me that, you know.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.777
Lew Alcindor, as he was known last year,

21:16.860 --> 21:20.197
his official name now
is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.281
He got it!

21:22.032 --> 21:25.702
As a professional athlete,
we can connect with the fans.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.539
And the people want
to hear something rational,

21:28.622 --> 21:33.293
and you can't go about it impatiently
or voicing your anger,

21:33.377 --> 21:36.380
because people are turned off by anger.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.842
You have to voice what the issues are

21:39.925 --> 21:42.886
and hope that people will listen to you.

21:42.970 --> 21:47.891
And when they-- people understand,
and give you a patient listen,

21:47.975 --> 21:51.144
that's when the bridge opens up
and, you know,

21:51.228 --> 21:54.314
the dialogue starts,
and that's how things get solved.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.360
Sometime tomorrow, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

21:58.443 --> 22:01.363
will officially become a member
of the Los Angeles Lakers.

22:02.573 --> 22:06.326
Coming back to Los Angeles, it really made
for an easy transition for me.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.580
The way things worked out,

22:09.663 --> 22:12.958
we got a draft pick that ended up
being Magic Johnson.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.920
…skyhook up and the Lakers win!

22:17.004 --> 22:19.173
And Magic Johnson is out there

22:19.256 --> 22:22.718
celebrating like they've
just won the NCAA championship!

22:23.552 --> 22:26.013
Magic, with his youthful exuberance,

22:26.096 --> 22:29.057
was quite a change for the team
and myself.

22:29.766 --> 22:33.312
Now I was the older player,
and Magic was the younger player,

22:33.395 --> 22:35.731
but that changed
the fortunes of the Lakers, you know,

22:35.814 --> 22:39.401
because he was the guy
that we needed to make us complete.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.487
Hail to the new kings,
the Lakers. It's over.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.907
Together, you know, we made history.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.868
The LA Lakers have won it at home.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.078
Their second world championship
in three years.

22:50.162 --> 22:53.999
Early on in my NBA career,
I could be, like, distant, you know,

22:54.082 --> 22:59.213
because I'm so focused on trying
to maintain the quality of my game.

22:59.296 --> 23:02.466
But when you concentrate so much
on doing your job well,

23:02.549 --> 23:06.553
sometimes you forget
that it's a group experience, you know.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.640
LA comes to Boston
and wins the world title.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.808
I think sports tells us that

23:11.892 --> 23:15.729
in order to be successful, you can't
live your life just for yourself.

23:16.522 --> 23:20.317
It's really, you know,
all the moments with your teammates

23:20.400 --> 23:22.945
that end up being your legacy.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.948
The Lakers have won it again!

23:35.499 --> 23:39.920
Dear Kareem,
after all you've accomplished in the NBA

23:40.003 --> 23:41.880
and everything you've done as an activist,

23:41.964 --> 23:45.092
I'm sure there are many places
people think of when they think of you.

23:45.175 --> 23:49.179
"The Forum, the STAPLES Center,
even Pauley Pavilion.

23:49.263 --> 23:52.182
But I'm sure no one thinks
of Dyckman Street projects."

23:52.850 --> 23:54.810
You and I are similar in that way, Kareem.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.271
I grew up
in the Mar Vista Gardens projects.

23:57.354 --> 24:01.191
And although I'm the third generation
in my family to live in this neighborhood,

24:01.275 --> 24:04.945
it feels less and less like home
with each passing day.

24:05.529 --> 24:09.199
But before I get into that, you should
know just how much you inspire me

24:09.283 --> 24:12.119
to keep pushing the envelope
on behalf of my community.

24:12.995 --> 24:14.997
My name is Alejandro.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.542
You put your career on the line early on.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.795
You spared nothing when it came
to speaking out about social injustice.

24:21.879 --> 24:24.882
While many athletes are fearful
it will put them in jeopardy,

24:24.965 --> 24:26.049
that didn't stop you.

24:26.133 --> 24:29.094
I learned from my high school
history teacher, Sonny Lloyd,

24:29.178 --> 24:32.097
about the decades and decades
of racial tension

24:32.181 --> 24:34.892
and struggles people have been fighting
in this country.

24:34.975 --> 24:38.187
"It's the exact same thing
we're going through today.

24:38.270 --> 24:41.565
I couldn't believe it.
I wondered how I could make a difference."

24:42.649 --> 24:44.359
I'm a Bruin like you.

24:44.443 --> 24:46.695
I majored in Chicano studies here at UCLA,

24:46.778 --> 24:49.656
and this is also
where I began my career as an activist.

24:50.449 --> 24:53.619
Here on campus,
I attended and organized my first protest,

24:53.702 --> 24:56.663
connected with other activists
and joined organizations

24:56.747 --> 24:58.498
that were giving back to the community.

24:58.582 --> 25:02.753
"Remember the feeling when you scored
a record 56 points your sophomore year?

25:02.836 --> 25:05.839
I bet you felt like
you were on top of the world, right?"

25:06.590 --> 25:08.592
That's how I felt when I was here,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.553
but I couldn't ignore
what was happening in my community.

25:13.430 --> 25:17.476
Gentrification has been happening
in my neighborhood for years now.

25:18.227 --> 25:22.022
One of two things happens
when new people move into the community.

25:22.105 --> 25:25.943
Either they ignore us altogether
or they see us as a threat.

25:26.026 --> 25:30.405
I can't tell you how many times the police
have been called on my friends and family

25:30.489 --> 25:34.451
for throwing get-togethers,
having barbecues, playing music,

25:34.535 --> 25:36.161
things we've been doing for years.

25:36.954 --> 25:40.874
Imagine when a baby shower
turns into a disturbing the peace charge.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.504
The pain and frustration
had been building up for a while,

25:45.587 --> 25:49.007
but when George Floyd was murdered,
that was the last straw.

25:49.716 --> 25:54.137
You used your platform to speak out,
saying what we all felt in that moment.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.934
When I read your words in the LA Times,

25:59.017 --> 26:01.478
"Racism in America
is like dust in the air."

26:03.272 --> 26:06.400
"It seems invisible,
even if you're choking on it.

26:06.483 --> 26:10.195
Until you let the sun in,
then you see it's everywhere."

26:11.238 --> 26:12.823
"As long as we keep shining that light…"

26:12.906 --> 26:15.576
…we have a chance of cleaning it
wherever it lands.

26:15.659 --> 26:20.122
That's when it clicked for me.
I knew I had to be that light.

26:22.082 --> 26:25.252
I teamed up with
my high school history teacher, Mr. Lloyd,

26:25.836 --> 26:27.796
and we founded 4 Corners 4 Justice,

26:27.880 --> 26:30.632
an organization that aims
to unite communities of color

26:30.716 --> 26:32.467
in the four corner neighborhoods,

26:32.551 --> 26:36.305
Culver City, Santa Monica,
Venice and West LA.

26:36.889 --> 26:40.934
This is only the beginning of a movement
that we are bringing to the Westside.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.770
We are four corners strong,
and we are LA strong.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.607
This has been your career for so long.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.817
Does it bother you that idea

26:48.901 --> 26:51.403
that somebody's gonna come
and say to you, "It's time to…"

26:51.486 --> 26:55.282
You don't understand that your profession
means that much to you

26:55.365 --> 26:56.867
until you have to find a new one.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.160
And it's like, it's easy--

26:58.243 --> 26:59.411
I never thought of that.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.875
In 1988, I got injured.

27:04.958 --> 27:09.505
And they give you ice sometimes,
and I'd never liked ice. Avoided ice.

27:10.339 --> 27:15.427
But when I injured my knee that year, and
I'd put ice on it, and the ice felt good.

27:16.595 --> 27:18.931
That's when I knew
I'm gonna have to get outta here.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.684
This is getting to be too long.

27:22.768 --> 27:26.772
The NBA's all-time leading scorer
saw his number retired last night

27:26.855 --> 27:28.023
at Inglewood, California.

27:34.196 --> 27:37.032
But, I gotta say,
you know, through basketball,

27:37.115 --> 27:39.284
I learned a work ethic enables you

27:39.368 --> 27:43.664
to have the confidence
that you can do something.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.708
Kareem is also a New York Times
best-selling author,

27:46.792 --> 27:49.962
and now he's written his first novel,
Mycroft Holmes.

27:50.045 --> 27:51.880
I write because I feel

27:51.964 --> 27:55.509
I have to point certain things out
from my perspective.

27:57.511 --> 28:01.098
When I get letters that say that people
have learned from what I've written,

28:01.181 --> 28:05.185
and it's helped them understand something,
I'm very gratified.

28:05.686 --> 28:09.481
Having that opportunity post-NBA career
has been fun

28:09.565 --> 28:14.486
and a great challenge
and something that I have enjoyed.

28:14.570 --> 28:17.614
The NCAA bans the dunk.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.619
They didn't say it was about Kareem,
but it was about Kareem.

28:24.830 --> 28:28.208
When a sport changes its rules

28:28.292 --> 28:30.586
to make it harder just for you,

28:31.378 --> 28:32.713
you are really good.

28:34.381 --> 28:39.344
I received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom from President Obama.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.138
He's pretty tall,

28:41.221 --> 28:44.808
but still he might have a difficult time
getting it around my neck,

28:44.892 --> 28:47.477
so I made sure I stooped down low enough

28:48.187 --> 28:49.730
so he could reach around my neck.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.982
But the reason we honor Kareem

28:52.065 --> 28:56.236
is more than just a pair of goggles
and the skyhook.

28:56.987 --> 29:01.283
He stood up for his Muslim faith
when it wasn't easy and it wasn't popular.

29:01.909 --> 29:05.787
Or writing with extraordinary eloquence
about patriotism.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.918
Physically, intellectually, spiritually,
Kareem is one of a kind,

29:11.001 --> 29:14.087
an American who illuminates
both our most basic freedoms

29:14.171 --> 29:15.923
and our highest aspirations.

29:16.006 --> 29:20.177
I think it's absolutely true that
one person's actions can inspire another.

29:21.720 --> 29:28.185
The younger generation,
they take what we did as their foundation.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.486
Well, they're building
on a larger foundation than we had.

29:38.987 --> 29:43.492
And, you know, we had a larger foundation
than the era before us.

29:50.541 --> 29:53.460
That's just what people call progress

29:53.544 --> 29:54.545
or evolution.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.174
You've truly inspired
the trajectory of my life,

29:59.258 --> 30:01.885
and for that I will always be thankful.

30:02.469 --> 30:06.348
We're following your example by shining
that light, fighting against racism,

30:06.431 --> 30:09.643
giving a voice to our community
and preserving our culture.

30:09.726 --> 30:13.522
We're the most impactful
when we use our voices to tell the stories

30:13.605 --> 30:15.357
that wouldn't otherwise be told.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.110
I hope people are getting to the point

30:18.193 --> 30:22.030
where they can appreciate
everybody's humanity

30:22.114 --> 30:24.908
and when Americans have to
speak out against

30:24.992 --> 30:27.661
what they perceive as injustice,
I think we should listen.

30:28.787 --> 30:29.788
Thank you, Kareem.

30:29.872 --> 30:32.374
All my best, Jap.

30:32.958 --> 30:36.128
Your partner in the fight, Alejandro.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.089
Sincerely, Lauren A. Jones.
