02:46.743 --> 02:48.411
You better get married.

02:48.578 --> 02:51.080
You're starting to look old.

02:51.956 --> 02:54.333
Dad! You can't
say that to her!

02:54.500 --> 02:55.793
<i>Pappou!</i>

02:57.462 --> 02:58.463
Huh.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.882
<i>That's
a family tradition.</i>

03:01.049 --> 03:04.469
<i>My dad used to say that to me, and
now he just said it to my daughter.</i>

03:04.635 --> 03:06.846
<i>She's 17.</i>

03:08.556 --> 03:11.976
<i>My family worries about each
other because we're close.</i>

03:13.978 --> 03:15.438
<i>Very close.</i>

03:17.065 --> 03:19.108
<i>Extremely close.</i>

03:21.903 --> 03:25.073
<i>We see no difference between
hugging and suffocation.</i>

03:25.281 --> 03:28.576
Toula, find your daughter
a Greek boyfriend

03:28.743 --> 03:30.328
before she does
what you did.

03:30.995 --> 03:31.995
What the...

03:32.038 --> 03:33.539
You married a <i>kseno.</i>
My husband!

03:33.623 --> 03:37.251
He's a nice boy, very nice,
but not Greek, a <i>kseno.</i>

03:37.335 --> 03:38.586
How can you say that?

03:38.669 --> 03:39.670
Please stop!

03:40.088 --> 03:41.089
Hmm.

03:44.509 --> 03:47.762
<i>Do I speak for all
mothers of teens when I ask,</i>

03:47.929 --> 03:49.847
<i>"Does it ever get better?"</i>

03:51.849 --> 03:52.934
Hey, hey, hey.

03:53.017 --> 03:54.477
<i>Ela,</i> Costa!

03:54.936 --> 03:56.145
Nicko.

03:56.229 --> 03:58.856
Hey, Dad, pop the trunk.
I'm freezing my nads off.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.317
Too much makeup.

04:03.778 --> 04:05.404
We're gonna
have a nice day.

04:05.488 --> 04:08.032
And we'll paint,
and we'll do nice things.

04:08.533 --> 04:11.202
Gus, I put your pills
by your coffee.

04:11.369 --> 04:12.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:12.995 --> 04:16.249
Costa, did you finish drawing
Alexander the Great?

04:16.415 --> 04:20.545
Uh-huh. And I sculpted
a Parthenon out of soap.

04:20.711 --> 04:22.463
Very good, very good.

04:22.588 --> 04:23.589
Oh, no.

04:23.673 --> 04:27.677
Spell check corrected
"spanakopita" to "spina bifida."

04:27.760 --> 04:28.761
Ugh!

04:31.389 --> 04:32.557
Kisses.

04:33.599 --> 04:35.560
<i>Aw,
kisses from your child.</i>

04:36.227 --> 04:38.062
<i>That's over.</i>

04:39.272 --> 04:40.898
<i>My sister did it right.</i>

04:40.982 --> 04:43.985
<i>When her sons became possessed
by the teen wolf hormones,</i>

04:44.068 --> 04:45.820
<i>she popped out another one.</i>

04:46.195 --> 04:47.238
<i>And another one.</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:48.739
Let's go!
Put on your hat.

04:50.491 --> 04:54.162
Paris, you should come and help
at the restaurant sometime.

04:54.245 --> 04:56.080
You should butter
the garlic bread.

04:56.247 --> 04:57.540
Can't wait.

04:57.707 --> 04:59.083
Come here, darling.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.251
Ugh.

05:01.002 --> 05:03.212
Toula, you and Ian
seen these eyes?

05:03.421 --> 05:05.006
You better fix this.

05:05.214 --> 05:06.465
Okay, bye, bye.

05:06.549 --> 05:07.550
After school
you have hockey.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.136
Your brothers are coming,
so you make sure you score.

05:13.139 --> 05:16.267
You will score.
The Greeks invented hockey.

05:16.434 --> 05:18.978
Yes, because what do you
play hockey on? Ice.

05:19.145 --> 05:21.063
What is the Greek word
for ice? <i>Pago.</i>

05:21.230 --> 05:22.857
<i>Pago,</i> puck.
There you go.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.941
There you go.

05:24.192 --> 05:26.319
There you go.

05:26.444 --> 05:29.113
Now, give me a word, any word...

05:29.280 --> 05:33.284
...and I will show you how the
root of that word is Greek.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.119
Uh, Facebook.

05:35.453 --> 05:37.622
Huh. The Greeks
invented Facebook.

05:37.788 --> 05:39.874
We called it the telephone.

05:41.876 --> 05:43.002
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, <i>Pappou!</i>

05:43.085 --> 05:44.462
Paris.

05:44.629 --> 05:47.840
Keep your eyeballs open now
for a nice Greek boy

05:48.007 --> 05:50.635
so one day
you can make babies.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.969
Don't waste your eggs.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.387
Outstanding.

05:59.018 --> 06:01.938
Paris! <i>Pappou</i> didn't mean
to say anything hurtful.

06:02.021 --> 06:03.856
You're beautiful,
so beautiful.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.107
Of course you
don't look old.

06:05.274 --> 06:08.194
He just says stuff
like that. To me, too.

06:08.319 --> 06:09.359
You don't need
a boyfriend,

06:09.403 --> 06:11.989
you don't need to get
married and make babies!

06:12.156 --> 06:13.658
- Oh, my God.
- The lady's back again.

06:15.993 --> 06:17.161
Mother.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.664
<i>When did my name
change from...</i>

06:19.747 --> 06:20.748
Mommy!

06:20.831 --> 06:21.831
<i>...to...</i>

06:21.874 --> 06:23.000
Mother!

06:31.259 --> 06:32.260
Drama.

06:32.343 --> 06:33.678
Shut up, Tommy.

06:35.513 --> 06:38.266
<i>I guess when my
daughter started to pull away,</i>

06:38.349 --> 06:39.767
<i>I should have retreated.</i>

06:41.519 --> 06:43.688
<i>But I stayed too close.</i>

06:43.771 --> 06:45.940
<i>I kept volunteering
at her school.</i>

06:46.440 --> 06:48.818
<i>I wanted her to think
I was cool again.</i>

06:51.570 --> 06:52.571
Oh!

06:53.739 --> 06:55.199
Loser!

06:56.534 --> 06:59.203
<i>Then I remembered
I've never been cool.</i>

07:00.913 --> 07:02.915
Here comes
the principal.

07:07.336 --> 07:10.506
<i>My husband
has always been cool.</i>

07:11.090 --> 07:12.675
<i>He just has it.</i>

07:12.758 --> 07:15.469
<i>And he always knows
the perfect thing to say.</i>

07:15.553 --> 07:16.637
You okay, babe?

07:17.471 --> 07:18.472
Mmm-hmm.

07:19.015 --> 07:22.101
<i>Okay, so just when my daughter
doesn't want me around anymore,</i>

07:22.184 --> 07:24.478
<i>my parents need me
more than ever.</i>

07:27.481 --> 07:30.067
<i>So I go with them
to get groceries,</i>

07:30.151 --> 07:32.486
<i>to their doctors,
and to physical therapy.</i>

07:40.953 --> 07:43.247
The old guys suck the
chocolate off those nuts.

07:52.048 --> 07:55.760
<i>I loved being a travel agent,
but in a tight economy,</i>

07:55.843 --> 08:00.097
<i>the first things to go are luxuries
like travel and dry cleaning.</i>

08:00.931 --> 08:02.767
<i>Well, luckily,
people still eat.</i>

08:08.564 --> 08:09.565
Oh.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.900
Hold up, Dad.

08:49.563 --> 08:53.734
<i>My sister and brother have young
children so I help at the restaurant.</i>

08:53.818 --> 08:55.653
<i>It's what we do.</i>

09:15.548 --> 09:17.633
<i>'Cause families that
are close like mine,</i>

09:17.716 --> 09:21.929
<i>we make it through bad economies
and sickness and even wars</i>

09:22.012 --> 09:24.265
<i>because we stick together.</i>

09:24.890 --> 09:28.310
<i>But some of us
just get stuck.</i>

09:44.827 --> 09:45.828
Hey, Paris.

09:46.704 --> 09:47.705
Hey.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.334
Dad, do not talk to me.

09:52.418 --> 09:54.420
People think
I'm a narc!

09:54.503 --> 09:56.589
Well, shouldn't you be
in class right now?

09:56.714 --> 09:58.632
You track me all day.

09:58.716 --> 10:00.634
Mom's needy,
<i>Pappou</i> wants to marry me off,

10:00.718 --> 10:04.221
Yiayia constantly tells me to never
ever let a boy touch my <i>poulaki</i>

10:04.305 --> 10:06.515
because "once he
feels it, he wants it"!

10:07.558 --> 10:08.976
This family.

10:09.059 --> 10:10.394
Hey! Save it
for the shrink.

10:11.312 --> 10:12.438
Shut up, Tommy.

10:12.563 --> 10:15.524
Honey, your mom felt the
same way about being Greek.

10:15.608 --> 10:17.526
Dad, that's obtuse.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.361
Why would I have
an issue being Greek?

10:21.906 --> 10:24.033
I can't take that everyone
is always in my business.

10:24.116 --> 10:26.410
Give me some air.
I'm not a kid.

10:26.577 --> 10:28.204
I can be late to a class.

10:28.287 --> 10:32.082
There won't be a spasmodic catastrophic
ripple in the space-time continuum.

10:32.541 --> 10:33.542
Hmm.

10:33.626 --> 10:36.795
And, yes, four of those
words are Greek.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.853
Hi.

10:53.437 --> 10:54.647
Hi.
Hi.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.734
Where were you
when we set up?

10:59.652 --> 11:01.445
I'm so sorry.
My pipes froze.

11:01.529 --> 11:03.030
And decorated the gym.

11:03.113 --> 11:04.573
So I had to plunge my sink.

11:05.366 --> 11:06.951
You're on clean-up.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.078
Thank you.

11:12.915 --> 11:14.458
Hi.
Hi.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.876
You can say no to them.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.211
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:17.294 --> 11:19.922
Been a long time since those
two made fun of your lunch.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.049
They called it
moose-caca.

11:22.132 --> 11:24.593
Eh, come on, don't
let them boss you around.

11:29.515 --> 11:30.975
There's Paris.

11:32.309 --> 11:35.271
If she goes to Northwestern,
she'll stay in Chicago.

11:35.437 --> 11:37.773
Please, oh, please.
Let's go over there.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.149
No.
Right.

11:39.316 --> 11:40.609
There she is!

11:40.693 --> 11:41.735
Did you invite the family?

11:41.819 --> 11:42.819
Paris!

11:42.861 --> 11:44.613
I told my ma.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.828
Hold on. Hey! Hey!

11:51.161 --> 11:52.538
We're just in time.

11:53.163 --> 11:54.498
We're here!

11:54.582 --> 11:56.417
I want you to be
a dental hygienist.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.461
A mother working
two days a week, perfect!

12:00.045 --> 12:02.715
Paris, be a hairdresser.
Like me!

12:03.048 --> 12:04.049
Ian, look.

12:04.425 --> 12:06.468
Everybody has boys.

12:06.635 --> 12:09.346
You vegetarian. One girl.

12:09.597 --> 12:11.473
Slow sperm.

12:13.892 --> 12:16.186
That's <i>Theia</i> Voula
on the FaceTimes.

12:16.270 --> 12:18.063
<i>Maria, I'm on my way.</i>

12:18.314 --> 12:20.149
<i>I was at Zumba.</i>

12:20.733 --> 12:21.942
Who is Zumba?

12:22.026 --> 12:23.027
Sorry.

12:26.739 --> 12:29.283
We need to find
a boyfriend for Paris.

12:29.450 --> 12:31.952
How about Ariana Skoufis'
boy, huh?

12:32.119 --> 12:35.247
Everybody on that
island has six toes.

12:35.414 --> 12:39.001
Let's wait until summer.
We check his feet.

12:39.668 --> 12:41.128
I see you.

12:41.295 --> 12:43.130
I don't see you.

12:43.297 --> 12:44.798
I see you.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
I don't see you.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.594
I see you.

12:48.761 --> 12:51.680
I don't see you. I see you!

12:51.764 --> 12:52.765
I see her.

12:52.848 --> 12:53.848
Look at this app.

12:53.891 --> 12:56.393
Ten thousand steps,
I met my goal.

12:56.769 --> 12:59.605
Where's Taki?
He never answers the phone.

12:59.772 --> 13:01.899
Why stand when
you can sit?

13:02.191 --> 13:04.401
Look tired so
they leave us alone.

13:09.114 --> 13:10.154
Hey, Angelo.

13:10.199 --> 13:11.950
You get my
flat-screen TV?

13:12.034 --> 13:13.118
Yeah, I got it
right here.

13:16.121 --> 13:18.332
You can't breathe.
You can't breathe.

13:20.084 --> 13:21.669
Guys!
All right, break it up.

13:21.752 --> 13:23.754
Break it up.
You're coming with me.

13:25.547 --> 13:27.091
Hey, Mike?
Hey, buddy.

13:27.257 --> 13:28.634
You miss working here?

13:28.717 --> 13:30.844
No. Way too scary for me.

13:31.512 --> 13:32.638
Hey, sorry we're late.

13:32.721 --> 13:35.432
Yeah, we had to stop
and pick up Mana-Yiayia.

13:35.766 --> 13:37.101
Wait, where is she?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.644
Mana-Yiayia?

13:38.811 --> 13:40.104
Mana-Yiayia?

13:41.271 --> 13:42.856
Look low, everybody.

13:45.359 --> 13:46.694
Spanakopita!

13:49.029 --> 13:51.448
- Let me in there!
- I want a piece. Easy, guys. Easy.

13:51.907 --> 13:53.387
- Take a picture.
- Ooh, that's good.

13:53.659 --> 13:54.827
Hey, come.

13:55.452 --> 13:56.495
No, no, honey.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.038
You don't have to do that.
Why don't you just...

13:58.122 --> 13:59.123
It's okay.

14:03.544 --> 14:04.878
Pull my neck back.
Oh, yeah.

14:04.962 --> 14:06.547
And you do mine.
Okay.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.173
Pull, pull.
Okay.

14:08.257 --> 14:09.967
One, two, three, pull!

14:12.803 --> 14:13.804
Okay.

14:14.304 --> 14:15.305
Hey, Bennett.

14:15.848 --> 14:16.849
Good?

14:16.932 --> 14:18.559
Let me. I'll be the judge.

14:18.642 --> 14:20.018
Not bad.

14:20.477 --> 14:21.645
Oh, that looks good.

14:21.729 --> 14:22.896
Mmm. So good.
Mmm-hmm.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.106
We should go.

14:24.189 --> 14:25.190
Why?

14:25.274 --> 14:28.902
So Paris can speak with this
gentleman and go to Northwestern.

14:28.986 --> 14:30.487
Well, if she gets in.

14:30.571 --> 14:31.905
"If"?

14:36.660 --> 14:37.995
Come here.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.581
My niece wants to come to your
school, you're gonna say, "Welcome."

14:40.664 --> 14:41.665
You got it?

14:44.501 --> 14:45.836
Come here, pal.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.256
And a tuition discount means
a box of steaks for ya.

14:51.008 --> 14:52.050
Uh...

14:52.134 --> 14:53.677
Northwestern is
very selective.

14:53.761 --> 14:57.514
She's only coming there
if you teach Greek history.

14:57.598 --> 15:00.434
Of course.
We have an outstanding classics program.

15:00.517 --> 15:02.519
Greek, Italian.

15:02.603 --> 15:04.188
The Greeks invented Italian.

15:07.065 --> 15:08.692
Actually, no.
Yes.

15:08.776 --> 15:09.943
Nope.

15:10.027 --> 15:11.111
You Greek?

15:11.195 --> 15:12.780
No, sir.
I'm a Sephardic Jew.

15:12.863 --> 15:13.989
Then you Greek.

15:15.032 --> 15:16.992
No, my family is Spanish.

15:17.242 --> 15:20.954
Alexander the Great went through
Spain spreading his seed.

15:21.038 --> 15:22.080
You Greek.

15:22.164 --> 15:23.373
This is not the time.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.042
And it's ridiculous.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.877
The man doesn't know history.
"Spreading his seed"?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.003
Hey.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.133
Hey!

15:35.219 --> 15:38.055
Alabama, Florida,
Texas, New York.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.391
These are the colleges I'm applying to,
far, far away from here.

15:42.434 --> 15:45.646
Why do you want
to leave me?

15:50.651 --> 15:53.862
Didn't I say, get your
daughter a Greek boyfriend?

15:54.279 --> 15:56.365
Dad!
And you, educate yourself.

15:56.448 --> 15:59.117
We are all descendants
of Alexander the Great.

15:59.201 --> 16:00.994
I am for sure!

16:01.078 --> 16:02.371
No, you're not.

16:02.454 --> 16:03.997
Maria...
No, you're not.

16:04.081 --> 16:05.999
It's okay.
He knows, he knows.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.251
It's okay.

16:26.603 --> 16:27.604
<i>Gracias.</i>

16:35.571 --> 16:38.574
Okay, give me
a word. Any word.

16:38.866 --> 16:40.117
Chimichanga.

16:40.534 --> 16:41.535
Sure.

16:41.618 --> 16:47.499
"Chimi" comes from the Greek word
<i>"kima, "</i> which means "spicy beef."

16:47.583 --> 16:51.378
And "changa" comes from
the Greek word <i>"tsanda, "</i>

16:51.461 --> 16:53.547
which means "purse."

16:53.714 --> 16:57.384
So meat that is
shaped like a purse.

16:57.634 --> 16:59.219
Chimichanga.

16:59.344 --> 17:00.596
There you go.

17:00.804 --> 17:02.472
- There you go.
- Quit setting me up.

17:02.556 --> 17:03.849
Hey, just meet her.
She's from Holland.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.767
Nah. I don't
speak Hollandaise.

17:05.934 --> 17:07.144
Yeah, in the city.

17:07.310 --> 17:08.395
Exactly.

17:08.478 --> 17:09.479
Ah...

17:10.146 --> 17:11.397
It's ready.

17:11.815 --> 17:12.816
Eh.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.402
Hey.

17:16.737 --> 17:17.779
Hi.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.699
Just because you don't want to be
working here when you're my age

17:20.781 --> 17:24.118
doesn't mean you have to run off
to college in another city.

17:24.202 --> 17:26.622
I just hope you applied to
some local colleges, too.

17:27.664 --> 17:29.583
Why do parents
always say "dream big"

17:29.666 --> 17:32.085
when they really mean
"not too big"?

17:32.836 --> 17:36.715
Like, "Fly, little birdy. Wait,
no, let me hold your wings."

17:43.722 --> 17:44.806
Payback.

17:45.057 --> 17:46.099
What?

17:46.183 --> 17:47.684
Office.

17:58.570 --> 17:59.655
Sit.

17:59.905 --> 18:02.658
Oh, please don't lecture me
about my daughter.

18:02.741 --> 18:06.495
I'm going to find her
a boyfriend. Relax.

18:06.578 --> 18:08.872
Now, show me
how to work that.

18:09.164 --> 18:11.124
You want to learn
how to use a computer?

18:11.208 --> 18:15.087
Yeah, what's that thing called
where they search for the...

18:15.295 --> 18:16.505
DNA?

18:16.588 --> 18:17.839
A crime scene.

18:17.923 --> 18:20.634
No, no, where their
families come from.

18:21.051 --> 18:24.471
Oh, the Find Your
Ancestry site.

18:24.554 --> 18:26.674
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I'm going to prove to your mother

18:27.182 --> 18:30.060
that I'm related to
Alexander the Great.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.645
But don't tell her.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.897
Dad, you're gonna have to
type in your relatives

18:33.981 --> 18:35.857
all the way
back to 300 BC.

18:35.941 --> 18:38.151
You get frustrated
just adding up checks.

18:38.235 --> 18:42.030
Because your mother talks to
me and I lose count. Show me.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.241
Okay.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.995
This is called a mouse.
Why?

18:48.787 --> 18:50.497
I don't know.
Put your hand on it.

18:52.582 --> 18:53.625
Less.

18:57.713 --> 18:59.589
Good. Look on the monitor.

18:59.881 --> 19:01.800
Don't make up words.
You confuse me.

19:02.050 --> 19:05.303
Okay. Move your hand
on the mouse.

19:05.762 --> 19:08.557
This is your mouse
moving on the screen.

19:13.603 --> 19:14.771
I got this!

19:17.024 --> 19:18.900
Down, down, save.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.028
That's delete! Go back!
Oh, my God.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.446
Down, down.

19:22.863 --> 19:24.197
That's delete, Dad!

19:24.364 --> 19:26.742
No! Now what?
Okay!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.954
Dot, dot. Okay.

19:31.788 --> 19:33.123
Now...

19:33.874 --> 19:35.709
No! No!

19:35.792 --> 19:36.918
Toula!

19:37.002 --> 19:39.087
0-6-6...
No, no, no. 6-0-6.

19:39.254 --> 19:41.715
6-0... 0-6-0-6.

19:41.882 --> 19:42.883
"Quit"?

19:42.966 --> 19:43.966
No quit!

19:44.009 --> 19:45.719
1-9-2-9.

19:45.886 --> 19:48.096
1-2-9-9.
No, no, no.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.181
Toula!

19:49.264 --> 19:51.558
Oh, no, no, don't click
on that, Dad. That's porn.

19:51.641 --> 19:52.642
It's porn?

19:54.478 --> 19:56.678
I don't know how it got there.
Delete, delete, delete...

20:01.276 --> 20:02.486
Nicko, wake up!

20:02.569 --> 20:04.029
Look what it's doing.

20:04.488 --> 20:05.655
Toula!

20:09.242 --> 20:10.577
No. No. No!

20:11.870 --> 20:13.121
Stay down.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.834
Stay.
You're older than me.

20:18.001 --> 20:19.669
No, no!
Stop! No eyes!

20:20.003 --> 20:21.004
Sit.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.924
How's it going, Dad?

20:24.174 --> 20:25.342
Oh, is slow.

20:44.569 --> 20:45.570
Huh.

20:53.203 --> 20:55.997
See, honey?
You can't move away.

20:56.081 --> 20:57.791
Who will you
go to church with?

20:57.874 --> 20:59.167
Paris, look.

21:01.419 --> 21:02.838
Husbands.

21:03.755 --> 21:04.965
I'll be in the car.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.216
I'll go with you.
Me, too.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.300
Of course.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.553
Angelo, go pick a wife.

21:10.762 --> 21:12.764
Ma, I'm not 13 anymore.

21:12.931 --> 21:15.976
Maria, Costa,
we have a new family.

21:16.184 --> 21:18.145
Hi.
Hello.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.689
We're the Mikoses.
I'm Anna, this is my husband George.

21:20.856 --> 21:22.482
How you doin'?
Hello.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.401
I am Maria Portokalos.

21:24.568 --> 21:26.820
This is my husband Costa.
Gus, for short.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.823
Do you have
any children?

21:29.906 --> 21:30.949
Do you have a son?

21:31.032 --> 21:32.792
We do. We have a son.
Yeah, we do have a son.

21:33.368 --> 21:35.120
Ah. Meat eaters.

21:35.203 --> 21:37.747
Maria, please invite them
to our restaurant.

21:38.081 --> 21:40.041
And bring your son.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.419
Excuse me now,
I have to go talk to the priest.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.503
Okay.

21:43.587 --> 21:45.422
Be careful, Gus.
Your hip.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.756
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:48.592 --> 21:49.593
I know you.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.219
Oh.

21:51.303 --> 21:53.584
You must recognize my husband
from the Channel Seven news.

21:54.556 --> 21:55.849
Come on, do the thing.

21:55.932 --> 21:56.975
Oh, yeah?

21:57.434 --> 21:59.144
Hey now, Chicago.

22:06.610 --> 22:10.238
<i>Pater,</i> look at
my wedding certificate.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.659
Never signed.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.914
Will you...

22:19.289 --> 22:21.124
I'm sorry, Costa.
Can't do it.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.713
You're not married?

22:26.838 --> 22:27.839
Shush!

22:28.840 --> 22:30.217
How can this be?

22:30.508 --> 22:32.093
Well, you know, the war.

22:32.177 --> 22:35.180
The priest in our village,
he never finished the seminary.

22:35.472 --> 22:37.224
There was no money
for anything.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.351
So, I guess he just
came back to the town,

22:39.517 --> 22:43.063
he start to do funerals
and baptisms and weddings

22:43.230 --> 22:44.648
and nobody knew.

22:45.148 --> 22:47.609
Lucky we got married
in Athens.

22:49.694 --> 22:51.529
Our priest just
can't sign it?

22:51.988 --> 22:53.198
He's not allowed.

22:54.199 --> 22:55.617
What did Maria say?

22:55.784 --> 22:59.871
I don't know how I'm going to tell her.
You know how upset she'll be.

23:05.919 --> 23:07.504
We're not married?

23:07.587 --> 23:08.630
No!

23:08.755 --> 23:10.507
And we had children?

23:10.674 --> 23:11.675
Yes!

23:14.928 --> 23:16.930
I'm a hippie.

23:17.722 --> 23:19.140
"Hippie."

23:21.142 --> 23:23.436
Maria, this is serious.
It's not right.

23:23.853 --> 23:26.022
Who cares?
We're married now.

23:26.189 --> 23:28.316
By what's...
What's that called?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.985
Time served.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.404
People will find out.

23:33.530 --> 23:35.073
We have to get married.

23:35.156 --> 23:38.702
Yeah, Dad. "You better get married.
You're starting to look old."

23:43.248 --> 23:44.249
Too soon?

23:44.332 --> 23:45.333
Mmm-hmm.

23:46.501 --> 23:49.129
The priest says
he will do it.

23:49.212 --> 23:50.714
We can go today.

23:50.797 --> 23:51.798
Today?

23:51.881 --> 23:53.091
Sounds good! Let's go.

23:53.174 --> 23:55.218
Oh, okay. Okay!
That's good. That's good.

23:55.385 --> 23:57.887
I'm not ready to get
married just like that.

23:58.054 --> 23:59.723
We're married already.

23:59.889 --> 24:01.975
Then why do we have to
see the priest?

24:03.518 --> 24:04.769
What's going on?

24:06.271 --> 24:07.522
Gus,

24:10.442 --> 24:13.611
I want you to propose to me.

24:14.404 --> 24:15.613
I did!

24:15.780 --> 24:18.658
Not really.
You didn't say it right.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.120
And it's been bothering
me for 50 years.

24:22.287 --> 24:23.580
What did I say?

24:23.747 --> 24:25.373
You don't remember?

24:25.540 --> 24:27.959
It was a long time ago.

24:28.126 --> 24:32.922
You said, "I'm going to America.
You coming or not?"

24:33.340 --> 24:34.341
Uh...

24:34.924 --> 24:35.967
That's direct.

24:36.634 --> 24:37.844
Dad, I can't
believe you said that.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.138
What's wrong with that?
I think it's fine. Honest.

24:40.221 --> 24:41.639
Oh, wait. I remember.

24:41.723 --> 24:44.934
You said, "I want to
put a baby in you."

24:45.393 --> 24:46.728
Nicko.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.564
I thought it was
romantic. Hey!

24:49.731 --> 24:51.771
And that was the last time
you tried being romantic.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.693
Nobody warns you
when you get married

24:53.777 --> 24:55.236
the romance is gone
just like that.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.911
Can we focus on
my parents, here?

25:05.121 --> 25:07.707
Ma, what's the matter?

25:08.792 --> 25:11.753
I just don't want to
get married today.

25:13.505 --> 25:14.672
Maria!

25:15.715 --> 25:17.717
Mom, hold on.
Toula, do something!

25:17.801 --> 25:20.470
I'll talk to her.
Everybody, out.

25:22.055 --> 25:23.640
I thought it was
a good proposal.

25:35.693 --> 25:36.903
Hi, <i>Theia.</i>

25:37.654 --> 25:41.032
A little present from me.
I just did your living room.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.660
Ah. Thank you.
How's my mom?

25:44.452 --> 25:48.873
Oh, your mom isn't talking to your
dad until he proposes, and your dad

25:49.416 --> 25:52.502
says she's always been bossy
and he won't do it.

25:53.253 --> 25:54.671
This is for you.

25:54.838 --> 25:57.465
Oh, thank you.
I have tweezers.

25:57.632 --> 25:59.050
Oh, with a light.

25:59.884 --> 26:02.762
All right, I'll talk to my mom
and dad after I make dinner.

26:02.846 --> 26:04.055
No offense.

26:05.223 --> 26:09.144
You and your husband
look terrible.

26:09.853 --> 26:10.854
Okay.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.773
Stop trying to
fix everything.

26:14.607 --> 26:19.195
You baby your parents because you
can't parent your baby no more.

26:19.362 --> 26:22.574
Your generation,
you're super mommy.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.910
Then one day you wake up,
you realize your baby don't need you.

26:26.077 --> 26:27.871
You forgot how to
brush your hair.

26:28.371 --> 26:29.497
I don't have time
to brush my hair.

26:29.664 --> 26:32.417
Text your husband.
You're going on a date.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.500
Where?

26:33.543 --> 26:36.963
I don't know.
Do I have to do everything?

26:38.506 --> 26:43.303
And afterward, this will
help you sleep better. Hmm.

26:43.386 --> 26:44.596
Look, satin.

26:44.762 --> 26:47.974
Slippery, like an eel.

26:48.141 --> 26:49.309
<i>Theia.</i>

26:49.684 --> 26:52.145
That is the last thing
I can think about.

26:52.312 --> 26:55.273
I need a shower, I need to dye
my hair, I need wrinkle cream...

26:55.440 --> 26:56.649
Wrinkles! No.

26:57.192 --> 26:59.819
Greek don't creak.

26:59.944 --> 27:02.739
Anyway, you know
what Taki likes in bed?

27:03.114 --> 27:04.115
Oh, no.

27:04.949 --> 27:06.284
Confidence.

27:07.952 --> 27:09.412
That's sexy.

27:09.579 --> 27:11.122
Okay, I'm done.

27:12.081 --> 27:13.917
And dress up like
a hotel maid.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.919
Men love morning
room service.

27:16.377 --> 27:17.754
Sunny side up!

27:18.213 --> 27:19.631
Okay. Good talk.

27:20.215 --> 27:23.801
Take your husband on a date.
Don't worry about anything.

27:23.968 --> 27:27.055
Mana-Yiayia and I will stay with Paris.
I'll talk to her.

27:27.222 --> 27:29.974
I'll scare her out of moving
away from her family.

27:30.141 --> 27:32.185
No, <i>Theia.</i>
I'm just kidding.

27:32.644 --> 27:34.312
Oh. Okay.
Not really.

27:35.438 --> 27:36.940
Have fun.

27:37.106 --> 27:39.150
Laugh, flirt.

27:39.317 --> 27:41.319
One rule. Don't fight.

27:41.486 --> 27:44.197
Which means don't talk
about your daughter.

27:44.364 --> 27:50.036
Remember, you were a girlfriend
before you were a mother.

27:52.247 --> 27:53.289
Okay.

27:54.332 --> 27:55.542
You're welcome.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.126
Shave everything.

27:57.669 --> 27:59.963
Everything. Ooh!

28:03.299 --> 28:04.459
I'll check this for you.

28:04.509 --> 28:06.135
Thank you.
You're welcome.

28:22.318 --> 28:24.779
Quick, sit down before
my wife gets here.

28:31.828 --> 28:32.829
Wow.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.876
You look pretty.

28:41.004 --> 28:43.923
Well, four hours, $500.

28:46.384 --> 28:47.385
How much?

28:48.261 --> 28:50.513
You look so handsome.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.723
Yeah?

28:51.889 --> 28:53.766
Yeah!
Thanks.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.268
Aunt Voula called
me up, she said,

28:55.435 --> 28:58.021
"You used to be good-looking.
Get it together."

28:58.104 --> 28:59.105
Oh.

28:59.188 --> 29:01.858
So I...
Buzzed my nose hairs.

29:02.317 --> 29:04.777
Ah. Well, now I know that.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.363
Who said there's no romance
after marriage?

29:09.073 --> 29:10.116
Me.

29:12.869 --> 29:14.245
Me, too.

29:15.747 --> 29:16.914
Want to work on it?

29:18.958 --> 29:20.043
Okay.

29:21.294 --> 29:24.255
Don't have garlic tonight
because you might get lucky.

29:28.092 --> 29:30.428
You really think Paris is
gonna go away to college?

29:31.888 --> 29:35.975
You know, Aunt Voula said that
we shouldn't talk about Paris.

29:37.018 --> 29:38.603
Oh.
Yeah.

29:41.064 --> 29:42.065
Okay.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.232
Okay.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.072
So, how was your day?

29:49.572 --> 29:51.741
Why can't we talk
about Paris?

29:51.908 --> 29:52.909
I know.

29:53.284 --> 29:54.452
I mean, I have to.

29:54.619 --> 29:57.455
Me, too. How do we stop
her from moving away?

29:57.580 --> 29:59.780
I was thinking that we could
act like it's okay with us.

29:59.916 --> 30:01.000
Reverse psychology?

30:01.167 --> 30:02.877
Yeah, it always works.
That's great.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.170
Or we could
write a letter.

30:04.337 --> 30:06.339
"Dear admissions board,
we hope you accept our daughter"

30:06.506 --> 30:08.591
"because she just
got outta jail."

30:09.092 --> 30:12.637
"P.S. Do you have a student
lounge where she can sell pot?"

30:14.347 --> 30:16.099
That's funny.
That's funny.

30:21.437 --> 30:24.565
I don't know what I'm gonna
do if she goes away.

30:26.359 --> 30:27.360
Don't.

30:27.944 --> 30:30.196
No, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

30:30.279 --> 30:32.448
Come on.
Please don't.

30:32.615 --> 30:34.117
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

30:34.283 --> 30:35.952
It's gonna be okay.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.878
This is why Aunt Voula said,
"Don't talk about Paris."

30:47.296 --> 30:50.091
But once you're a parent,
what else do you want to talk about?

30:50.258 --> 30:51.634
I don't know.

30:53.928 --> 30:59.142
<i>Theia</i> Voula said to remember
I was a girlfriend before I was a mother.

31:03.479 --> 31:05.440
Yeah, you were
my girlfriend.

31:11.112 --> 31:12.822
Hey, remember
when we were dating,

31:12.905 --> 31:15.025
you wouldn't let me drop you
off in front of the house

31:15.283 --> 31:17.083
'cause you didn't want
your parents to see me?

31:17.118 --> 31:19.495
No. I didn't want you
to see the house.

31:21.164 --> 31:22.832
How could I miss it?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.836
I used to park right...

31:27.795 --> 31:28.880
...here.

31:31.507 --> 31:32.925
What's going on?

31:33.468 --> 31:35.762
I remember those
good-night kisses.

31:37.847 --> 31:39.182
Oh, you do, huh?

31:39.265 --> 31:40.266
Mmm-hmm.

31:46.606 --> 31:47.686
What are you doing?
Nothing.

31:59.869 --> 32:02.205
Get this off. Get it off.
Do you need help?

32:02.288 --> 32:04.373
Okay, get my tie.

32:08.377 --> 32:09.587
Get it off.

32:13.382 --> 32:14.550
What you doing?

32:18.054 --> 32:19.680
Nothing, nothing!
We're just going.

32:19.847 --> 32:21.265
It's...
Everything's okay.

32:21.933 --> 32:24.727
You don't have a house to do that?
Oh, my God.

32:25.937 --> 32:27.688
Gus, what's wrong?

32:31.025 --> 32:33.110
Perfect.

32:33.277 --> 32:35.446
Parents deserve
a sex life.

32:36.072 --> 32:38.074
Said no one ever.

32:38.366 --> 32:40.034
What is going on
in here?

32:40.201 --> 32:42.078
Nothing.
We're just talking.

32:42.245 --> 32:45.456
Honey, by the way, we think you
should go to college out of state.

32:45.623 --> 32:47.708
What is that?
Reverse psychology?

32:51.087 --> 32:52.964
That never works.
That never works.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.257
That never works.

32:54.423 --> 32:56.425
What's going on?
I'm calling the cops.

32:56.968 --> 32:58.219
It's okay, Mrs. White.

33:00.304 --> 33:02.598
Quiet! Stop it! Quiet!

33:02.765 --> 33:04.600
He doesn't speak English.

33:08.396 --> 33:10.106
I've got pepper spray.

33:11.732 --> 33:12.942
Come on. Come on.

33:13.109 --> 33:14.777
Ian Miller...

33:14.944 --> 33:16.195
In the street?

33:16.362 --> 33:17.530
It is indecent.

33:17.697 --> 33:19.699
Oh, Gus,
what is the problem?

33:19.782 --> 33:21.409
At least
they are married.

33:21.492 --> 33:22.493
Maria!

33:22.869 --> 33:24.412
We are not married.

33:25.162 --> 33:26.414
You want decency?

33:26.581 --> 33:29.250
Tonight, you sleep
in another room.

33:30.167 --> 33:31.544
Socrates, let's go.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.963
- Fine!
- No fine!

33:35.798 --> 33:36.841
Uh...

33:36.924 --> 33:39.302
Can I just ask?
Yes, dear.

33:39.844 --> 33:45.141
Your grandparents are living in sin
because your <i>pappou</i> won't propose.

33:45.308 --> 33:48.227
Uh, I don't get why
Yiayia needs that.

33:48.311 --> 33:53.149
Because you're not a woman who has
put up with <i>Pappou</i> for 50 years.

33:55.484 --> 33:57.320
I have to fix this.

33:57.486 --> 33:58.988
No, you don't.

33:59.155 --> 34:00.156
Where were we?

34:00.323 --> 34:01.741
No, we can't.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.118
Mmm.

34:04.827 --> 34:05.912
Oh. Oh.

34:21.844 --> 34:23.094
It's too tight.

34:23.179 --> 34:24.764
Hey, you're late today.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.098
My wife wouldn't drive me.

34:26.514 --> 34:28.225
Why not?
Nothing, nothing.

34:28.309 --> 34:29.435
Lift these.

34:30.603 --> 34:31.896
I'll be back.

34:34.982 --> 34:36.484
She's gone.

34:38.194 --> 34:39.445
You Greek?

34:40.112 --> 34:41.322
Iranian.

34:41.489 --> 34:42.822
So, Persian?

34:43.741 --> 34:45.784
In 334 BC,

34:45.868 --> 34:50.331
Alexander the Great conquered the
Persian army and occupied the East.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.750
You so Greek,
we probably related.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.505
We had civilizations
in Persia 3,000 years

34:57.588 --> 35:00.383
before you Greeks
discovered rocks.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.469
The Greeks gave the world
philosophy, democracy.

35:03.552 --> 35:07.682
The Chinese gave the world
paper, tea and medicine.

35:07.807 --> 35:11.560
Without Scotland's Alexander Fleming,
the world wouldn't have penicillin.

35:12.353 --> 35:14.897
Soon I will have proof

35:14.981 --> 35:19.068
that I am a direct descendant
of Alexander the Great.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.281
Hey!

35:29.954 --> 35:32.164
He's a moody, moody bear.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.417
Did you leave the dishes
in the sink like I told you?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.501
Yes.
Good.

35:35.584 --> 35:36.836
I sleep with the dog.

35:36.919 --> 35:39.880
And she don't give me
my pills in the morning.

35:39.964 --> 35:42.258
She won't clean,
she won't do my laundry.

35:43.217 --> 35:44.719
Anarchy.
Anarchy.

35:45.011 --> 35:48.723
I don't understand.
Why can't he just propose?

35:48.806 --> 35:50.850
Because he is stubborn.

35:50.933 --> 35:51.934
Oh...

35:53.769 --> 35:54.770
He's looking!

35:54.937 --> 35:57.523
Act like we're having fun.
One, two, three.

36:02.278 --> 36:03.320
Oh, no, really?

36:03.571 --> 36:04.572
Oh...

36:06.407 --> 36:08.909
Reporting for my garlic bread shift.
Hi.

36:08.993 --> 36:11.704
So many other things I could
be doing in my senior year.

36:11.787 --> 36:13.831
Like thinking
about prom?

36:13.914 --> 36:15.791
Nah,
I'm not going to that.

36:18.461 --> 36:20.838
Anything come from colleges yet?
No.

36:20.921 --> 36:22.506
Hello, everybody.
Good to see you again.

36:23.424 --> 36:25.051
Listen, my wife
and son are in the car.

36:25.134 --> 36:26.635
Should I bring them in now?
Good time to visit?

36:26.719 --> 36:27.803
Yes!

36:28.679 --> 36:29.805
Okay.

36:30.639 --> 36:32.308
He has a son for Paris.

36:32.850 --> 36:36.312
Ah. Did you see the hair
on that Greek god?

36:36.479 --> 36:38.522
Now, I'm going to
fix everything.

36:38.689 --> 36:40.357
Paris will stay
in Chicago.

36:40.524 --> 36:42.401
I will be the hero,

36:42.485 --> 36:45.738
and then that woman
can propose to me!

36:45.863 --> 36:47.448
Ah.

36:48.783 --> 36:50.951
Remember when you
asked me out on a date?

36:51.035 --> 36:52.411
Kinda.

36:52.495 --> 36:54.330
How about
another date tonight?

36:54.497 --> 36:55.748
How about "Yeah"?

36:55.831 --> 36:58.084
I cleaned the car.
Ooh.

36:58.167 --> 37:00.127
Everybody,
I have a surprise!

37:00.503 --> 37:02.713
Paris, wipe your face.

37:04.173 --> 37:05.174
Uh-huh.

37:06.092 --> 37:08.385
Dad, what are you up to?

37:08.552 --> 37:11.097
Every Greek girl should
have a Greek boyfriend

37:11.263 --> 37:13.307
and I found you one.

37:13.849 --> 37:14.934
Hello.

37:15.017 --> 37:16.060
Hi.

37:21.023 --> 37:22.149
We're getting married!

37:23.609 --> 37:26.278
You said you had
a son for my granddaughter.

37:26.362 --> 37:28.197
No, he didn't.
You don't listen!

37:29.281 --> 37:31.367
Come on, you can help me
butter garlic bread.

37:33.077 --> 37:35.412
Anyway, welcome
to my restaurant.

37:35.579 --> 37:36.997
Our restaurant.

37:37.164 --> 37:40.251
Is in my name, which
makes you my employee.

37:40.376 --> 37:41.377
Ah...

37:42.419 --> 37:46.632
So, then I want back pay
for 50 years of overtime!

37:46.715 --> 37:47.716
- Ah.
- Dad!

37:47.800 --> 37:49.969
Okay. Mom. Okay.

37:50.052 --> 37:52.471
Welcome, welcome.
Come, let us feed you.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.640
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Okay.

37:55.724 --> 37:56.892
Come on, let's go.

37:56.976 --> 37:59.145
What? We can't
leave right now.

37:59.311 --> 38:02.314
All my life,
I wanted to be a newscaster,

38:02.481 --> 38:04.984
but I have
a very dry mouth.

38:05.276 --> 38:10.197
When I went through puberty,
my tongue swelled up like a tree trunk.

38:10.364 --> 38:12.408
It's still puffy. Look.

38:12.908 --> 38:14.160
Ah.
Oh, I don't want to.

38:15.161 --> 38:16.162
Oh, God, that's big.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.997
I don't want to.
Ah...

38:18.080 --> 38:20.875
Maria, we have
important company.

38:20.958 --> 38:22.042
I don't care!

38:22.126 --> 38:23.127
Oh.

38:24.044 --> 38:26.881
Employee, bring menus.

38:29.175 --> 38:30.801
Get them yourself!

38:31.010 --> 38:32.011
Oh.

38:33.012 --> 38:34.847
Yeah.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.849
Come on, Toula.

38:37.558 --> 38:38.601
Oh.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.269
I was rude to the boss.

38:41.812 --> 38:44.148
I hope
I don't get fired.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.363
She's just kidding,
you know.

38:53.574 --> 38:55.618
She's, uh...

38:56.035 --> 38:57.203
She's, uh...

38:57.912 --> 39:01.707
You know? Not every day,
but sometimes.

39:07.963 --> 39:09.924
Maria,
where are you?

39:19.558 --> 39:20.559
Oh.

39:22.353 --> 39:23.873
<i>Hey, it's Ian.
Leave me a message.</i>

39:24.605 --> 39:25.606
It's me again.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.317
I'm sorry I'm late.
I am closing up.

39:28.484 --> 39:30.069
I'm coming right now.

39:30.152 --> 39:31.320
I'm sorry.

40:06.397 --> 40:07.481
What are you doing?

40:09.483 --> 40:10.985
The phone's ringing.

40:13.195 --> 40:15.239
Hello?

40:15.322 --> 40:16.365
Hey, Maria.

40:16.740 --> 40:17.825
Uh...

40:17.908 --> 40:19.660
Yes. Okay.

40:20.411 --> 40:22.579
Your dad got stuck
in the bathtub.

40:22.663 --> 40:24.081
She can't lift him.

40:41.390 --> 40:42.599
I got this, Ma.

40:43.475 --> 40:44.810
What's up, Dad?

40:44.893 --> 40:46.228
Hello, Nicko.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.564
Ma, you couldn't put
some clothes on him?

40:49.189 --> 40:50.858
If I could,
I wouldn't need you.

40:51.025 --> 40:52.067
What happened?

40:52.234 --> 40:53.944
Did he fall?
It's that hip.

40:54.111 --> 40:55.112
It locked.

40:55.279 --> 40:56.405
I'm fine!

40:56.572 --> 40:57.656
No fine!

40:57.823 --> 41:00.743
Do your physical therapy
like everybody else.

41:00.909 --> 41:02.077
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

41:02.494 --> 41:05.331
All right, all right, we can
handle this, boys. Oh, yeah.

41:05.914 --> 41:07.374
Ma, why don't you
empty the tub?

41:07.458 --> 41:09.585
And put a towel over him.
Okay.

41:09.668 --> 41:10.669
Thank you.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.671
Yeah, you can't un-see that.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.198
- What's going on?
- Just be quiet!

41:14.298 --> 41:15.338
Should I call
an ambulance?

41:15.466 --> 41:16.925
No, no, that'll
make him feel old.

41:17.092 --> 41:18.260
Yeah, he'd never
forgive you.

41:18.427 --> 41:19.595
Me?
Yeah.

41:19.762 --> 41:22.306
Yeah, you'd call, and we'd
have to tell him you called.

41:22.389 --> 41:24.600
Well, what are we
gonna do?

41:24.808 --> 41:26.435
When I was in the kitchen,
we had to season a roast.

41:26.602 --> 41:28.979
I had to put my hands
underneath it and turn it over.

41:29.104 --> 41:33.192
Okay, I put a towel
over his private parts.

41:33.359 --> 41:34.610
A big one!

41:34.777 --> 41:37.279
Yes, Gus, a big one.

41:38.781 --> 41:39.823
Okay, what's...

41:39.907 --> 41:40.908
What's the plan?

41:41.075 --> 41:42.159
We're gonna
roll him over.

41:42.326 --> 41:44.536
Yeah, and he gets on his hands
and knees, and he's up!

41:44.703 --> 41:46.455
Okay, we ready?

41:46.622 --> 41:47.623
No!

41:47.706 --> 41:49.750
God, no.
No. No. No.

41:50.084 --> 41:51.627
How will that work?

41:56.632 --> 41:58.300
Why are your
eyes closed?

41:59.760 --> 42:00.886
Okay. Let's go.

42:01.053 --> 42:02.554
- Let's go.
- Flip him.

42:02.679 --> 42:04.807
Turn him over like a roast!

42:04.890 --> 42:06.225
Keep the towel on!

42:06.725 --> 42:08.644
Oh!
That's not the plug.

42:08.727 --> 42:09.853
Sorry.

42:09.937 --> 42:11.377
Ouch!
He's biting! He's biting!

42:11.480 --> 42:12.689
Angelo! My nuts!

42:12.773 --> 42:14.024
I'm calling an ambulance.

42:14.108 --> 42:15.109
Who's pushing?

42:20.155 --> 42:21.365
Come on.

42:21.448 --> 42:23.826
I always knew
there'd be a murder here.

42:24.284 --> 42:26.370
Ah, the grandma
finally went.

42:26.495 --> 42:28.831
Well, what was she, 120?
Mmm-hmm.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.208
Must have slept
in pickle juice.

42:34.837 --> 42:38.006
All right, here,
this will take away your pain.

42:38.090 --> 42:41.385
Twice I drank it.
I gave birth without drugs.

42:43.220 --> 42:44.513
You know,

42:45.180 --> 42:48.684
one of my ovaries
never put out an egg.

42:49.184 --> 42:52.062
But the other one would
spit out two a month.

42:52.229 --> 42:53.856
I could feel it
right here.

42:54.022 --> 42:55.023
Right there.
Oh, yeah.

42:55.190 --> 42:56.692
Ping, ping.

42:56.859 --> 42:59.194
But the left ovary,
nothing.

42:59.361 --> 43:02.448
It was closed
like a stuck zipper.

43:02.573 --> 43:03.740
Really?

43:03.824 --> 43:04.825
Uh-huh.

43:08.871 --> 43:10.289
Are you okay?

43:11.498 --> 43:12.958
I still see it.

43:16.044 --> 43:18.297
Does this count
as a date?

43:18.380 --> 43:19.465
No.

43:20.549 --> 43:21.717
I'm sorry.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.968
Toula!

43:24.761 --> 43:26.180
I'm coming.

43:30.058 --> 43:31.518
Gus, you okay?

43:31.643 --> 43:33.145
I'm fine.

43:33.896 --> 43:35.230
No fine!

43:35.731 --> 43:36.732
Thank you so much.

43:36.815 --> 43:37.816
Toula.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.401
Go to the hospital.

43:39.902 --> 43:40.903
Okay.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.488
What? Why?
You're not coming?

43:42.571 --> 43:43.572
No!

43:43.655 --> 43:45.532
Family members only!

43:45.741 --> 43:47.743
That means children,

43:47.910 --> 43:50.162
and wife,
if you had one.

43:50.913 --> 43:52.080
What?

43:59.338 --> 44:00.923
If I...
Hey, wait, wait!

44:02.549 --> 44:03.592
Maria!

44:04.760 --> 44:05.761
What?

44:07.596 --> 44:10.224
Will you marry me, please?

44:16.438 --> 44:19.733
Yes! Okay?
I'll marry you!

44:23.445 --> 44:26.114
Toula, take me
to the hospital.

44:26.782 --> 44:27.824
Okay.

44:27.908 --> 44:29.409
I'll get my car.

44:29.493 --> 44:30.827
Oh, my hip.

44:30.911 --> 44:32.204
Such a weird family.

44:32.287 --> 44:33.622
Odd people.

44:37.751 --> 44:38.794
What?

44:40.671 --> 44:42.005
You mean "pardon"?

44:42.297 --> 44:45.509
No. I mean, "What?"

44:45.676 --> 44:48.011
As in, "What is
wrong with you?"

44:49.304 --> 44:53.350
You're standing in my driveway
making fun of my family?

44:53.517 --> 44:55.435
Oh, we're so weird.

44:55.602 --> 44:58.355
Oh, we smell like burnt
oregano and feta cheese.

44:58.438 --> 44:59.523
I got it.

44:59.606 --> 45:00.816
I got it.

45:01.650 --> 45:03.902
But that's my dad
going into that ambulance.

45:03.986 --> 45:06.530
My dad, into that ambulance,
and you are standing here...

45:06.613 --> 45:08.323
Good night, everyone.

45:13.495 --> 45:15.247
I'll come
to the hospital, too.

45:27.634 --> 45:28.635
Hi, sweetheart.

45:28.719 --> 45:29.803
Hi, Ma.
Hey, Yiayia.

45:29.886 --> 45:30.929
You all right?

45:31.013 --> 45:32.014
Oh, what a night.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.020
Good morning.

45:38.186 --> 45:39.354
Hi, there.

45:39.521 --> 45:41.023
Beautiful day today.

45:41.189 --> 45:42.566
How's your husband?

45:42.983 --> 45:43.984
He'll live.

45:44.067 --> 45:45.193
Oh, good.

45:45.777 --> 45:46.945
So I can kill him.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.202
What was that?

45:54.286 --> 45:56.038
Basically, Mom told them
to suck it.

45:56.121 --> 45:57.164
Good.

45:57.247 --> 46:00.375
Paris, you come from a
long line of strong women.

46:00.459 --> 46:01.460
Which means,

46:01.543 --> 46:04.212
you get to choose your own
seven-year-old boyfriend.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.159
So, Yiayia, are you and <i>Pappou</i>
really gonna get married now?

46:10.218 --> 46:11.261
Yes.

46:12.095 --> 46:14.848
And this time,
I'm doing it right.

46:22.856 --> 46:23.899
Goodness.

46:25.942 --> 46:28.262
This one. This is the one.
No, I don't like this. This one.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.155
Look, you coming out
of the flower.

46:30.447 --> 46:31.490
No.

46:31.573 --> 46:34.201
What did she say...
Beautiful!

46:36.745 --> 46:39.706
This is the most beautiful
cake I ever saw.

46:40.082 --> 46:43.627
Gus is going to love it!
Bravo, bravo, bravo!

46:45.837 --> 46:47.317
Oh, look at this!
Perfect!

46:47.381 --> 46:49.716
Pepto-Bismol pink.
Where's the driver?

46:49.841 --> 46:51.551
- Wow.
- A big one!

46:51.718 --> 46:53.553
This is so good.
Mmm...

46:54.137 --> 46:55.764
Love it. Love it.
This is good.

46:55.931 --> 46:57.933
Take a photo!
Yeah, take a photo.

46:58.433 --> 46:59.768
All right,
pull my neck.

46:59.935 --> 47:01.770
One, two, pull!

47:05.649 --> 47:06.775
I'm so excited.

47:06.942 --> 47:09.778
They have to make
the breasts bigger for me.

47:10.904 --> 47:12.280
Oh, look at this one!

47:16.243 --> 47:17.244
You like it?

47:17.703 --> 47:18.954
This is nice.

47:19.955 --> 47:21.957
Where's Mana-Yiayia?

47:23.417 --> 47:24.751
Mana-Yiayia?

47:39.307 --> 47:40.308
Paris!

47:40.392 --> 47:41.810
Over here, Dad.

47:51.319 --> 47:52.320
You open them.

47:52.404 --> 47:53.739
Just tell me.

48:07.669 --> 48:09.880
You've been accepted at
Northwestern University

48:09.963 --> 48:11.256
here in Chicago...

48:11.339 --> 48:12.966
...and NYU, New York City.

48:22.184 --> 48:24.019
We're so proud of you!

48:24.644 --> 48:27.481
Okay, okay, okay.
Decision time.

48:29.191 --> 48:31.443
Where do you wanna
go to college?

48:33.737 --> 48:35.739
I'll stay here
in Chicago.

48:35.822 --> 48:37.073
Okay.
That's good.

48:37.157 --> 48:38.658
If that's what
you want.

48:38.742 --> 48:39.868
Yeah.

48:45.332 --> 48:46.374
Dad.

48:46.666 --> 48:48.186
Did you hear?
Paris is staying.

48:48.251 --> 48:49.503
She found a boyfriend?

48:50.003 --> 48:51.213
Dad.

48:51.713 --> 48:55.008
Toula, it very good news.

48:55.175 --> 48:56.259
Yep.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.888
Your hip is better.
The physical therapy is working.

49:00.388 --> 49:02.265
It's not that therapy.

49:02.682 --> 49:04.434
I can fix it myself.

49:10.232 --> 49:11.316
Of course.

49:13.485 --> 49:14.486
Oh!

49:16.279 --> 49:17.739
I just remembered.

49:17.906 --> 49:23.078
Today, I sent out my application
for Alexander the Great.

49:23.829 --> 49:25.789
You mailed this
to Find Your Ancestry?

49:26.456 --> 49:27.791
By myself.

49:27.874 --> 49:32.003
It was so hard trying to
remember every name, every date.

49:32.379 --> 49:35.131
Well, you could have called
<i>Theio</i> Panos in Greece.

49:35.298 --> 49:38.426
Oh, so my brother can tell
me what I'm doing is stupid?

49:38.802 --> 49:39.928
Okay.

49:40.387 --> 49:42.013
How are the wedding
preparations?

49:42.597 --> 49:44.266
Fine, but, Toula,

49:44.432 --> 49:47.435
I can't afford the kind of
wedding your mother wants.

49:47.602 --> 49:48.603
I know.

49:48.770 --> 49:50.490
I was thinking we could
give you some money.

49:50.605 --> 49:52.941
No, no, you need it
for college.

49:54.734 --> 49:56.111
Are you okay?

49:56.653 --> 50:01.116
Yes, but I can't sleep
without your mother snoring.

50:01.825 --> 50:03.076
You're married.

50:03.243 --> 50:06.746
You know what it's like
to have that person there

50:06.913 --> 50:08.790
right beside you.

50:08.957 --> 50:10.458
In every way.

50:10.750 --> 50:15.463
You walk through your life seeing
your shadow as two people.

50:15.755 --> 50:18.049
You know you can
reach out in the night

50:18.592 --> 50:20.719
and that person
is there.

50:21.428 --> 50:22.721
And then they're not.

50:22.804 --> 50:24.973
Because they make you
stay on the couch

50:25.056 --> 50:27.517
until a priest
can say it's okay.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.730
Oh, Dad.

50:33.607 --> 50:36.234
I just made baklava.
You want a piece?

50:37.819 --> 50:38.862
No.

50:39.696 --> 50:40.864
Chocolate baklava.

50:42.949 --> 50:44.618
Just a small piece.

50:45.368 --> 50:47.287
I'll bring you the tray
and a fork.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.663
Put some strawberries.

50:48.830 --> 50:49.956
Okay.

50:56.379 --> 50:57.631
Mana-Yiayia?

51:00.383 --> 51:02.552
I'm gonna stay home
for college.

51:07.349 --> 51:09.017
That's good, right?

51:16.983 --> 51:18.526
It's what I want.

51:21.863 --> 51:23.365
But is not.

51:30.830 --> 51:34.876
The wedding planner,
she fired me!

51:39.214 --> 51:41.758
So, they're not
getting married?

51:41.841 --> 51:43.426
I have to fix this.

51:44.844 --> 51:46.471
When can you fix us?

51:49.391 --> 51:50.934
What do you mean?

51:51.309 --> 51:53.395
I mean, you're always
running in and out of here,

51:53.478 --> 51:57.190
you're cooking something,
you're volunteering somewhere.

51:57.273 --> 51:59.401
It's like you avoid
being alone with me.

52:00.235 --> 52:02.570
But you just explained
why I'm never here.

52:03.113 --> 52:05.365
Look, it's my fault, too.
We're busy.

52:05.532 --> 52:08.410
But, Toula, we've been
trying to have a date.

52:08.743 --> 52:09.744
I know.

52:09.911 --> 52:10.954
It's impossible.

52:11.121 --> 52:12.455
Your family pulls at you.

52:12.622 --> 52:14.082
But that's what
family does.

52:14.249 --> 52:16.793
No. That's what
your family does.

52:16.918 --> 52:18.586
My family doesn't
pull at me.

52:19.587 --> 52:21.965
Maybe they do
and you don't notice.

52:22.924 --> 52:24.342
Maybe, but...

52:25.802 --> 52:27.053
Please.

52:29.806 --> 52:32.976
Please, help me
get my parents married.

52:33.810 --> 52:35.687
Okay.

52:35.770 --> 52:37.439
Okay?
Yeah.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.028
Who should we call?

52:47.407 --> 52:48.491
I'm here.

52:48.575 --> 52:51.161
Thank you for coming.
Oh. This is so good.

52:51.244 --> 52:52.287
Watch your step,
Marianthi.

52:52.370 --> 52:53.371
Hi. Hi, Toula.

52:53.455 --> 52:54.831
You told the family?

52:54.914 --> 52:56.082
Of course.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.668
Mom and Dad!
Look, it's Rodney and Harry!

52:59.335 --> 53:00.754
Hey, you got any of that moussaka?
Hey.

53:00.837 --> 53:02.547
We just got here.
Where are you?

53:02.630 --> 53:04.340
I canceled
a waxing for this.

53:04.424 --> 53:05.675
Hey!
Hey.

53:08.887 --> 53:10.388
Tell your problem.

53:11.306 --> 53:13.308
The wedding planner quit.

53:18.021 --> 53:19.397
Oh, you all know that.

53:19.606 --> 53:20.607
Please.

53:20.690 --> 53:22.692
What are you, new?

53:22.776 --> 53:25.445
Telephone, telegram,
tell-a-Greek.

53:25.779 --> 53:27.655
Of course we know.
We know everything.

53:27.739 --> 53:29.240
I tweeted it.
Yeah.

53:29.365 --> 53:32.160
Aunt Voula, Toula was hoping
that you would talk to Maria.

53:32.535 --> 53:35.246
Yeah, convince her to just go to
the church and get it done, <i>Theia.</i>

53:35.330 --> 53:36.581
Please?
"Get it done"?

53:36.664 --> 53:39.000
Why? Because Dad's gonna
lose it, that's why.

53:39.084 --> 53:41.753
Why convince them
to just "get it done"?

53:41.836 --> 53:43.379
Look, weddings
are expensive.

53:43.546 --> 53:46.049
- Usually the parents pay for it.
- Yeah.

53:49.385 --> 53:51.638
But, I mean, what was with hiring
a wedding planner?

53:51.721 --> 53:52.806
I don't know.
I don't know.

53:52.889 --> 53:54.057
Yeah, we've all
had weddings.

53:54.140 --> 53:55.391
Right.
Except Angelo.

53:55.475 --> 53:56.726
Hey, we're not
talking about me.

53:56.810 --> 53:59.145
I'm just saying,
you don't need a caterer.

53:59.312 --> 54:00.522
Exactly.
We all cook.

54:00.688 --> 54:02.288
Some of us better than others.

54:02.357 --> 54:03.358
Don't start.

54:03.775 --> 54:05.276
Your baklava's dry.
Accept it.

54:05.735 --> 54:07.320
Mike, can you
taser her?

54:07.487 --> 54:10.281
- Only once per relative.
- You know my rule.

54:10.365 --> 54:11.908
Look, we can have the
reception at their house.

54:12.075 --> 54:14.619
I could do the hair.
Angelo can get Maria the dress.

54:14.702 --> 54:15.787
I got a connection.

54:15.870 --> 54:18.498
Oh, and my business partner,
he has tuxedos. He was in a band.

54:18.581 --> 54:20.083
I can do
an e-mailed invitation.

54:20.166 --> 54:21.668
I can help you
design it.

54:21.835 --> 54:23.795
Rodney, don't you have a friend
who owns flower shops?

54:23.920 --> 54:25.338
No. Oh, yes,
you do, honey.

54:25.421 --> 54:26.756
Well, let me think.
Wait!

54:26.923 --> 54:28.007
Oh, funeral homes.

54:28.174 --> 54:29.884
Perfect.
Okay, what else?

54:30.051 --> 54:31.427
You all wanna do this?

54:31.511 --> 54:32.887
Of course we do!
Yeah, of course!

54:33.263 --> 54:34.556
Thank you.

54:34.722 --> 54:36.266
Thank you so much!

54:36.432 --> 54:38.893
Maybe everyone could pick a category.
Food, glassware...

54:39.060 --> 54:40.854
The wedding is on!

54:41.020 --> 54:43.940
Pick a category, report to me.
I'm in charge.

54:44.274 --> 54:45.483
Actually, <i>Theia,</i>
you're not.

54:45.567 --> 54:47.569
Yes, it's best.
No, it's...

54:47.652 --> 54:49.612
It's what everyone
wants, dear.

54:51.239 --> 54:52.240
Okay.

55:39.954 --> 55:43.124
Hey, Tiahn, do you want to go
to prom with me?

55:54.302 --> 55:57.680
Tiahn, will you go
to prom with me?

55:58.139 --> 56:00.767
Oh, my Buddha!
They're both asking you to prom!

56:02.477 --> 56:05.480
Bennett, why are you
asking my girlfriend to prom?

56:08.316 --> 56:09.692
Girlfriend?

56:10.610 --> 56:13.529
Oh. Sorry, I didn't
know that you...

56:13.613 --> 56:15.198
We just started dating.

56:15.281 --> 56:17.158
So, who are you
going to prom with?

56:21.496 --> 56:23.998
Yes, Clifford,
I'll go to prom with you.

56:25.083 --> 56:26.334
Harsh.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.211
Walk away, dude.

56:28.294 --> 56:30.505
It's not too late
to change schools.

56:34.008 --> 56:35.009
Hi.

56:37.178 --> 56:38.179
Hi.

56:38.972 --> 56:40.598
Will you go
to prom with me?

56:40.890 --> 56:41.891
Um...

56:46.312 --> 56:47.397
Yeah!

56:52.944 --> 56:54.279
Great.

56:55.321 --> 56:56.656
I'll pick you up at...

56:56.739 --> 56:58.491
No, it's okay.
I'll pick you up.

57:02.495 --> 57:03.788
Sorry,
what's your name?

57:03.871 --> 57:05.081
Paris.
Oh.

57:06.374 --> 57:07.500
Cool.

57:09.043 --> 57:10.962
I can't believe I did that.

57:11.045 --> 57:12.297
Very brave.

57:12.380 --> 57:14.382
I heard I come from a long
line of strong women.

57:14.465 --> 57:15.842
You do.

57:17.885 --> 57:19.971
You're gonna miss
your grandparents' wedding.

57:20.054 --> 57:21.848
Ah, it's okay.
Prom is important.

57:21.931 --> 57:23.933
Guys?
Mmm-hmm.

57:24.934 --> 57:27.437
I want to go to
New York University.

57:42.452 --> 57:45.204
Higher! Use your
man muscles!

57:45.371 --> 57:46.748
Easy, easy.

57:56.341 --> 57:57.592
Jennie,
where's the cinnamon?

57:57.675 --> 57:59.677
It's over there.
I need that oven in five.

57:59.761 --> 58:01.095
I need more butter!

58:11.773 --> 58:14.067
Toula,
what's the matter?

58:14.776 --> 58:15.860
Toula?

58:16.444 --> 58:17.445
Nothing.

58:18.446 --> 58:19.864
Come on.

58:22.492 --> 58:23.951
It's okay.
It's a big day.

58:27.163 --> 58:28.164
Okay, run this down for me.

58:28.247 --> 58:29.791
All right. So, my nephews
are gonna be the waiters.

58:30.166 --> 58:33.169
Tables are there, but the plates
are just gonna go in the truck.

58:33.252 --> 58:35.505
Simple as that. After the wedding,
wrap it up, bring it here.

58:35.588 --> 58:36.923
Okay?
All right. Yep.

58:39.092 --> 58:40.176
Here you go.

58:47.642 --> 58:50.019
Hey, uh,
what's with Toula?

58:50.645 --> 58:52.365
I don't know.
But she'll tell me eventually.

58:54.649 --> 58:56.275
Because, uh, well...

58:57.235 --> 59:00.279
Why keep secrets
from your own family, right?

59:12.834 --> 59:14.585
He's your partner?

59:15.420 --> 59:17.171
Or your partner?

59:23.386 --> 59:24.846
He's both.

59:32.812 --> 59:34.021
I know.

59:40.361 --> 59:41.779
Ooh.

59:46.409 --> 59:49.036
It's the bride
on the FaceTimes!

59:49.787 --> 59:51.247
What do you need, Mom?

59:51.330 --> 59:52.957
<i>Who's gonna curl
all your hairs?</i>

59:53.040 --> 59:54.208
<i>Everyone get over here.</i>

59:54.459 --> 59:55.877
Come on! Let's go!

59:57.420 --> 59:59.213
We're coming!

01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:09.181
Tight!

01:00:09.223 --> 01:00:10.641
Yiayia,
open your presents.

01:00:10.725 --> 01:00:13.561
The pink one. The pink one.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:17.064
"With love,
from Dominique."

01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:18.941
"XOXO."

01:00:19.567 --> 01:00:21.652
Who is Xoxo?

01:00:21.736 --> 01:00:22.904
I don't know.

01:00:23.237 --> 01:00:24.363
Okay.

01:00:24.447 --> 01:00:27.492
One more layer, and this won't move
till your next wedding.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.251
There.

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:42.131
And this is gonna last you
till you graduate college.

01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:44.926
- Okay.
- I'm good.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.302
We're good.

01:00:46.385 --> 01:00:50.389
Paris, I hear for college
you are staying in Chicago.

01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:51.682
That's good!

01:00:51.766 --> 01:00:53.601
Oh yeah, close to home.

01:00:58.648 --> 01:01:00.691
You look pretty
on your big day, Yiayia.

01:01:00.775 --> 01:01:02.151
Honey <i>mou.</i>

01:01:03.611 --> 01:01:06.948
On my wedding night,
I met my husband

01:01:07.114 --> 01:01:08.199
and I fainted!

01:01:08.282 --> 01:01:11.702
That was the advice our mother
gave us on our wedding day.

01:01:11.786 --> 01:01:15.623
Yes. She said,
"If you're too nervous to do your duties,

01:01:15.957 --> 01:01:19.502
"just pretend to faint, and your
husband will take it from there."

01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:20.711
I did it.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:22.505
I did it.
Oh, my God.

01:01:22.672 --> 01:01:25.132
I waited for Taki
to scoop me up.

01:01:25.258 --> 01:01:27.009
Instead, he put
a blanket over me.

01:01:27.093 --> 01:01:29.762
I slept on the
cold floor by myself.

01:01:30.805 --> 01:01:34.141
Remember, Paris,
not until your wedding night.

01:01:34.267 --> 01:01:36.435
Tonight you protect
the <i>poulaki.</i>

01:01:38.396 --> 01:01:39.397
Okay, Ma.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.815
You said it,
let's move on.

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:42.817
There's more!
Of course.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.069
Didn't you leave the car running?
Uh-huh. Yes.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.531
Paris, eyes open,
knees shut!

01:01:48.698 --> 01:01:51.701
And you, if your
knees are open,

01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:53.411
shut your eyes.

01:01:57.832 --> 01:01:59.875
I always keep
my eyes shut tight.

01:02:00.042 --> 01:02:02.253
Oh. Not me. Not me.

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:06.507
I pretend Taki is a vampire
from one of those movies.

01:02:06.674 --> 01:02:10.177
Sometimes he likes me
to dress up like a wizard.

01:02:10.344 --> 01:02:13.014
Because he has
a magic wand.

01:02:13.347 --> 01:02:16.017
Oh <i>. Theia,</i> I love
your sex stories.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:17.852
Gotta go.

01:02:18.019 --> 01:02:19.103
What time is it?

01:02:19.186 --> 01:02:20.746
Oh, yes.
We're late, we gotta go!

01:02:23.232 --> 01:02:25.112
You'll help me with my dress?
Of course, I will.

01:02:25.192 --> 01:02:26.944
Pluck your eyebrow.

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:33.242
Mana-Yiayia?

01:02:36.537 --> 01:02:37.913
Have a seat.

01:02:59.602 --> 01:03:02.063
Just pick it up and go right here?
Yeah.

01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:27.129
- Got my size?
- Yeah.

01:03:27.296 --> 01:03:28.464
This should fit.

01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:29.632
Perfect!

01:03:29.757 --> 01:03:31.884
It's kinda short.
Sparkles?

01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:33.719
What was the band?
The Funkateers.

01:03:33.886 --> 01:03:35.221
They were huge.

01:03:35.388 --> 01:03:36.430
Never heard of them.

01:03:36.597 --> 01:03:37.598
Oh, look!

01:03:37.765 --> 01:03:41.769
Alexander the Great when
he conquered Mesopotamia.

01:03:42.144 --> 01:03:46.399
Oh, speaking of conquering,
tonight, be gentle with your bride.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.859
Oh!

01:03:48.943 --> 01:03:50.111
Taki!

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.446
What?

01:04:08.796 --> 01:04:10.798
That's my brother, Panos.

01:04:17.555 --> 01:04:20.266
I, I...
I don't like surprises.

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:21.976
Gus, the kids.

01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:24.687
They did it for you.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:26.939
Everybody pooled
their airline miles.

01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:30.818
Ian, you don't know because
you're not successful like me.

01:04:30.985 --> 01:04:33.529
But when you do well,

01:04:33.696 --> 01:04:37.616
you become a sign of hope
to the optimist.

01:04:37.783 --> 01:04:42.663
But to the pessimist, you represent
the stink of his own failure.

01:04:43.664 --> 01:04:45.499
That was
a long time ago, Gus.

01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:49.170
I send him money.
He sends it back.

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:51.213
Come on, let's go.

01:04:52.339 --> 01:04:53.340
Surprise!

01:04:55.843 --> 01:04:59.388
Congratulations on
your wedding today.

01:04:59.722 --> 01:05:00.931
Thank you.

01:05:01.015 --> 01:05:03.350
Put your things in the guest room,
huh? Okay.

01:05:03.517 --> 01:05:06.145
Nick, you have
a big house.

01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:08.647
What do you mean
by that?

01:05:08.814 --> 01:05:10.024
Oh, you know
what I mean.

01:05:10.191 --> 01:05:13.027
My son works hard.
He deserves a house.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.862
And I don't?

01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:16.864
You could have had this!
All of it!

01:05:17.031 --> 01:05:20.034
I chose to stay
in our country.

01:05:20.201 --> 01:05:23.704
I didn't abandon her then,
and I won't now. I'm a real Greek!

01:05:23.913 --> 01:05:25.706
I'm a real Greek, too.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.542
Let's drink.

01:05:32.713 --> 01:05:33.714
Come on, Dad.

01:05:41.013 --> 01:05:42.848
To the homeland.

01:05:44.016 --> 01:05:47.311
To the <i>patrida</i>
and the drachma.

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:58.197
Ah.

01:06:13.587 --> 01:06:16.549
To you, Panos,
my brother.

01:06:18.592 --> 01:06:21.762
To you, Costa,
my brother.

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:24.014
To you, Nick,
my brother.

01:06:24.098 --> 01:06:25.724
To you, Ian,
my brother.

01:06:57.089 --> 01:06:58.132
Mom?

01:07:04.763 --> 01:07:05.764
Wow.

01:07:06.515 --> 01:07:07.933
Look at you.

01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:22.948
You look great.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.534
Thank you.

01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:31.081
I'm surprised you're not on
the prom chaperone committee.

01:07:31.165 --> 01:07:33.000
They asked,
but I said no.

01:07:33.584 --> 01:07:34.793
Why?
Do you need me to be?

01:07:35.669 --> 01:07:36.921
Oh, God, no.

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:38.297
Okay, then.

01:07:41.342 --> 01:07:45.179
Am I always so close, you see
your shadow as two people?

01:07:48.849 --> 01:07:50.643
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:51.852
Okay.

01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:54.521
I'm stepping
back now.

01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:58.817
Go and have
a great time.

01:07:58.984 --> 01:08:01.528
Tonight and

01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:05.532
to college
in New York.

01:08:08.327 --> 01:08:11.121
And even though
I'm taking a step back,

01:08:11.205 --> 01:08:13.582
I will always be
right here.

01:08:17.211 --> 01:08:18.379
Thank you.

01:08:19.546 --> 01:08:20.589
Okay.

01:08:25.386 --> 01:08:26.386
That's Bennett!

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.598
Okay! Get the door!
Go! Go!

01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:31.444
No, don't get the door!
Just go over there.

01:08:31.558 --> 01:08:33.978
Wait! What am I doing?
That's stupid. Be cool, be cool.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.520
Okay, go.
Okay.

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.497
Your uncle hugs hard.

01:08:53.663 --> 01:08:54.707
Yeah.

01:08:55.666 --> 01:08:58.292
Was your grandma
in a wedding dress?

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.461
Yep.

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.509
So, where was the rest
of your family?

01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:06.760
Uh, who?

01:09:07.803 --> 01:09:10.764
I saw a bigger group
at the college fair.

01:09:11.557 --> 01:09:12.640
Oh. Yeah.

01:09:13.308 --> 01:09:15.394
Yeah.
They're like my family.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.522
Mmm. Except mine's
bigger, louder,

01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:20.441
more oily and in-your-face
than anyone's?

01:09:20.607 --> 01:09:21.692
No.

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:24.194
No family is louder
than my Greek family.

01:09:26.947 --> 01:09:27.948
You're Greek?

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:29.323
Yeah.

01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:42.046
Well, Mana-Yiayia's
in the house, so...

01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:44.381
I have not
seen her for...

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:45.799
Hey, Dad.

01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:48.343
Oh, Ian! Give me a hand, will you?
Yeah.

01:09:48.426 --> 01:09:49.845
Here. Yeah, great.

01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:53.223
All right.

01:09:53.307 --> 01:09:55.434
I will have to return this,
you know.

01:10:00.814 --> 01:10:02.441
You ever need anything?

01:10:02.524 --> 01:10:03.817
Like what?

01:10:04.276 --> 01:10:05.611
You know, from me.

01:10:05.694 --> 01:10:09.281
You need me to do anything,
or you want to talk about anything?

01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:12.493
Is someone ill?

01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:14.995
No, Dad, I just...

01:10:16.205 --> 01:10:18.248
You ever need anything,
I want you to call me, okay?

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.086
You got it, son.

01:10:24.379 --> 01:10:26.006
Sure.
Okay.

01:10:26.924 --> 01:10:28.342
See you
in church, huh?

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:30.427
Okay, get dressed!

01:10:30.511 --> 01:10:31.711
Hey, I gotta
swing by the prom,

01:10:31.762 --> 01:10:33.097
make sure the chaperones
aren't drinking.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.140
Oh, no, do not spy on Paris.
Never!

01:10:35.224 --> 01:10:36.683
Come on!

01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:38.560
Toula! What time is it?

01:10:38.727 --> 01:10:41.271
And why are
the limousines not here?

01:10:41.772 --> 01:10:43.398
Did we order limousines?

01:10:45.692 --> 01:10:46.819
Call Mike!

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.450
I'll get you there
as fast as I can.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:54.868
This is exciting!

01:10:55.035 --> 01:10:56.245
"Exciting"?

01:10:56.578 --> 01:10:58.163
All right,
make a hole, fellas.

01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:03.168
Officer, Officer,
go slower, please.

01:11:03.252 --> 01:11:04.545
Slower please.
Just a little bit.

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:06.755
I'll bet you
Gus is nervous.

01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:13.137
Faster, faster!
What?

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.221
Hold on, ladies!

01:11:15.556 --> 01:11:16.932
No, no, no!

01:11:17.182 --> 01:11:18.183
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

01:11:18.892 --> 01:11:19.893
My nuts!

01:11:38.245 --> 01:11:39.288
Oh, my.

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:50.591
Oh. Beautiful.

01:11:51.258 --> 01:11:52.259
Mana-Yiayia.

01:11:52.634 --> 01:11:54.261
I love your hair.

01:11:54.428 --> 01:11:56.597
I didn't even know
she had hair.

01:11:57.389 --> 01:11:58.432
Yeah.

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.018
Hey, what are they doing?
What's happening?

01:12:16.241 --> 01:12:18.493
<i>Hey, it's Ian.
Leave me a message.</i>

01:12:19.119 --> 01:12:21.538
I have an aunt who always
talks like she's got,

01:12:21.622 --> 01:12:23.749
like, a piece of lamb stuck
in the back of her throat.

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.000
Always, she'll be, like,

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.877
"Bennett! Bennett!

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.962
"Say hello to your parents!"

01:12:29.463 --> 01:12:31.924
"If you see my daughter,
tell her I'm upstairs."

01:12:32.007 --> 01:12:33.133
"Upstairs."

01:12:35.344 --> 01:12:36.887
So, why aren't you
in Greek Club?

01:12:37.346 --> 01:12:40.057
Oh. Every day of my life
is Greek Club.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.351
Mmm.
Why, what do you do there?

01:12:42.517 --> 01:12:44.895
Same as they do in,
like, Chinese Club

01:12:44.978 --> 01:12:47.147
and Lebanese Club
and Spanish Club.

01:12:47.231 --> 01:12:50.442
We all just sit around
and we eat food

01:12:50.525 --> 01:12:52.653
and we make fun
of our parents.

01:12:52.819 --> 01:12:54.196
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:12:56.281 --> 01:12:58.825
You look so nice.

01:12:59.076 --> 01:13:00.369
Thank you.

01:13:00.786 --> 01:13:02.329
You do, too.

01:13:02.663 --> 01:13:03.830
Thanks.

01:13:07.793 --> 01:13:10.462
Hey, do you want to dance?

01:13:10.545 --> 01:13:11.838
Yes!

01:13:11.922 --> 01:13:13.006
I got some killer moves.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:14.716
Do you? I can boogie hard.
Let's do it.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.177
Okay, then.

01:13:17.261 --> 01:13:18.345
Oh, well...

01:13:41.952 --> 01:13:43.792
We should have brought
the drinks in here.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.955
Sit down.

01:13:46.081 --> 01:13:47.541
I know, I know.

01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:50.627
Have they been drinking?

01:14:16.737 --> 01:14:19.281
I've been waiting
a long time to do that.

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:33.045
She is coming. Look up.

01:15:04.576 --> 01:15:05.577
Maria, what's...

01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:07.371
Where is she going?
<i>Pater.</i>

01:15:08.955 --> 01:15:10.332
Where she's going?

01:15:10.415 --> 01:15:11.416
Toula,
do something.

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:13.001
Go, go!
Okay.

01:15:13.126 --> 01:15:14.127
Excuse us,
excuse us.

01:15:14.211 --> 01:15:16.421
What?
Now everybody's going.

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:19.591
You okay?

01:15:19.674 --> 01:15:20.714
What's going on?

01:15:20.759 --> 01:15:23.220
He is not taking
this seriously.

01:15:26.223 --> 01:15:28.016
Gus,
go have a drink.

01:15:31.978 --> 01:15:33.021
He is now.

01:15:33.105 --> 01:15:34.981
What am I
getting married for?

01:15:35.816 --> 01:15:37.067
What's happening?

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:39.861
Who says a woman
is supposed to be married?

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.614
Um, you. All our lives.

01:15:42.697 --> 01:15:47.285
Because in my day,
women were raised to be married.

01:15:47.536 --> 01:15:48.745
But is that it?

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.000
I've been thinking,
maybe I could have traveled.

01:15:54.251 --> 01:15:58.255
I could have cured diseases,
wrote poetry,

01:15:58.338 --> 01:16:01.007
had adventure in my life.

01:16:01.675 --> 01:16:04.886
Instead of being saddled
with a grouchy old man

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:08.181
yelling every morning
for his mineral oil

01:16:08.265 --> 01:16:10.308
so his bowels
won't get backed up!

01:16:13.311 --> 01:16:14.438
I'm gonna get my ma.

01:16:14.521 --> 01:16:16.189
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

01:16:19.693 --> 01:16:20.777
What is it, dear?

01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:23.697
Ma, you really gotta come.
She's freaking out. Come!

01:16:24.531 --> 01:16:27.075
What do men want?
A companion

01:16:27.409 --> 01:16:28.785
or a nurse?

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:31.329
Okay, here's Ma.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.833
Gus is a good man.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:36.334
He's a crazy man.

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.837
True.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.548
You know, I can't do this anymore.

01:16:42.299 --> 01:16:44.759
No, no, no.
I'm not doing this.

01:16:44.926 --> 01:16:47.012
Toula, do something!

01:16:47.095 --> 01:16:48.375
I'm trying to not
fix everything.

01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.223
That's not working!
That's not working.

01:16:50.307 --> 01:16:51.307
That's not working.

01:16:51.391 --> 01:16:52.809
- Think it over for a second.
- I got nothing.

01:16:52.893 --> 01:16:54.133
Ladies.

01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:56.730
Maria.

01:16:57.314 --> 01:17:02.861
Fifty years ago, Gus was so happy
because he had found someone

01:17:02.944 --> 01:17:07.741
who was brave like him to come to
America and live an adventure.

01:17:07.908 --> 01:17:11.828
I remember
his hopeful expression.

01:17:11.912 --> 01:17:17.125
And he has that same look
on his face today.

01:17:23.089 --> 01:17:24.633
I was brave.

01:17:27.636 --> 01:17:32.390
Maybe my adventure
was to make a family.

01:17:34.601 --> 01:17:37.020
Marriage is not
for everybody,

01:17:39.439 --> 01:17:42.359
but it worked out
okay for me.

01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:49.908
It's been a good life.
It's been a good life.

01:17:49.991 --> 01:17:51.034
Ma.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.453
Psst!

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:57.207
You are still hot.

01:17:57.624 --> 01:17:58.833
I know.

01:17:58.917 --> 01:17:59.960
Get out.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:17.227
Dad said he can't sleep
without your snoring.

01:18:19.145 --> 01:18:21.064
I don't snore, he snores.

01:18:21.147 --> 01:18:22.148
Okay.

01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:26.653
He can't sleep without me?

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:27.821
No.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:46.298
You know what?

01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:50.176
I love him.

01:18:50.302 --> 01:18:51.678
Ah!

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:54.681
Your father may be crazy,

01:18:55.015 --> 01:18:58.393
but at least I'm not
a blood relative of his.

01:18:58.476 --> 01:18:59.686
You are!

01:19:00.729 --> 01:19:01.980
Sorry.

01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:07.902
Ah, let's do this thing.

01:19:08.612 --> 01:19:09.946
Oh!
Okay!

01:19:10.697 --> 01:19:12.949
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

01:19:13.033 --> 01:19:14.659
Okay, okay, okay.

01:19:14.743 --> 01:19:17.203
You can do it!
Okay! Okay!

01:19:40.226 --> 01:19:41.394
Thank you.

01:19:53.782 --> 01:19:55.867
Hello.

01:19:57.118 --> 01:19:58.787
You're here!
Yeah.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.748
Everything go smooth?

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:02.916
Oh, no.

01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:06.211
Did you see Paris?

01:20:06.586 --> 01:20:07.754
Yeah.

01:20:20.767 --> 01:20:22.394
Say something nice.

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.479
I missed you.

01:20:26.606 --> 01:20:27.857
Good enough.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.485
I missed you, too.

01:20:37.701 --> 01:20:39.869
But you snore, not me.

01:20:51.131 --> 01:20:53.007
Wow. They're doing it.

01:20:53.174 --> 01:20:54.300
Yeah.

01:21:04.811 --> 01:21:05.854
Hi.

01:21:06.688 --> 01:21:07.814
Hi.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.987
Will you marry me?

01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:17.615
Yes.

01:21:20.201 --> 01:21:21.327
Now.

01:21:21.995 --> 01:21:23.079
Now?

01:21:23.538 --> 01:21:24.664
Now.

01:21:25.623 --> 01:21:26.666
Yes.

01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:51.120
Look what you did!

01:24:51.204 --> 01:24:53.164
We did! Come on!

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:54.958
Huh?

01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:57.669
Hey, I wasn't avoiding you.

01:24:57.835 --> 01:25:01.381
It's just, I've been a mom for so long,
I don't remember how to be us.

01:25:01.547 --> 01:25:04.217
With Paris gone to college,
it'll be just us.

01:25:04.384 --> 01:25:06.886
We can do whatever we want.
We can take a vacation.

01:25:07.053 --> 01:25:08.721
We could adopt a baby.

01:25:09.847 --> 01:25:10.974
Think about it!

01:25:11.057 --> 01:25:13.768
Come on, just think about it.
We could do anything, we're newlyweds!

01:25:13.935 --> 01:25:15.269
Yeah, we are.

01:25:15.895 --> 01:25:17.063
We are.

01:25:20.566 --> 01:25:21.985
Did you think about it?

01:25:22.068 --> 01:25:26.114
Okay, too soon. Okay, just give it
some thought, little bit of thought.

01:25:28.908 --> 01:25:30.410
Hey, Ma, let's go dance.

01:25:31.077 --> 01:25:32.078
Uh-uh.

01:25:38.251 --> 01:25:41.754
Hi, I'm Patrick.
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:25:42.213 --> 01:25:43.840
You look Greek.

01:25:43.923 --> 01:25:44.924
Are you?

01:25:45.633 --> 01:25:46.634
No, sir.

01:25:46.801 --> 01:25:48.177
That's okay.

01:25:48.261 --> 01:25:49.929
Don't apologize.

01:25:52.432 --> 01:25:54.225
Come on, let's dance.

01:25:54.976 --> 01:25:58.521
All my life, I had
a mole on my tummy.

01:25:58.604 --> 01:26:00.815
It was shaped
like Mýkonos.

01:26:00.982 --> 01:26:04.235
Oh! I have so much
to tell you. Come.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.614
Look.

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:14.787
Hi!
Hey!

01:26:15.455 --> 01:26:17.331
I'm gonna kill you!

01:26:17.707 --> 01:26:19.042
Oh!

01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:20.125
Guys!

01:26:20.168 --> 01:26:22.170
Come on! Up you get.
Leave him alone.

01:26:22.253 --> 01:26:23.504
I'm so sorry.
Come on, let's go.

01:26:23.588 --> 01:26:24.588
So sorry.

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:26.883
Wait, guys, my nuts!
Come on!

01:26:26.966 --> 01:26:28.634
Guys! Watch out.

01:26:32.638 --> 01:26:34.265
I have to do something.

01:26:34.432 --> 01:26:35.475
What?

01:26:39.604 --> 01:26:42.148
Dad, look, it came.

01:26:43.274 --> 01:26:44.317
Right there.

01:26:46.652 --> 01:26:47.653
I knew it!

01:26:52.992 --> 01:26:53.992
Wonderful!

01:26:54.035 --> 01:26:55.411
Stop! Stop the music.

01:26:55.828 --> 01:26:57.455
Thank you, thank you!

01:26:59.832 --> 01:27:02.668
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:27:02.835 --> 01:27:07.131
<i>this paper is
an official document</i>

01:27:07.298 --> 01:27:11.677
<i>which proves that I,
Gus Portokalos,</i>

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:17.141
<i>am a direct descendant
of Alexander the Great.</i>

01:27:20.478 --> 01:27:21.854
Of course you are!

01:27:23.231 --> 01:27:25.191
Hey, that means we all are!

01:27:25.274 --> 01:27:26.275
Yes, we are!

01:27:26.692 --> 01:27:28.361
Yes, yes, yes!

01:27:33.157 --> 01:27:36.744
Look! You see that?
Alexander the Great!

01:27:40.373 --> 01:27:42.375
Did you write
that letter?

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:43.793
Yep.

01:27:43.876 --> 01:27:44.877
Mmm-hmm.

01:27:46.379 --> 01:27:50.174
The paper?
I'm going to frame this.

01:28:11.237 --> 01:28:12.864
Yes. There you go.

01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:17.743
It's pretty loud
back there.

01:28:18.703 --> 01:28:20.204
Want to join us?

01:28:22.707 --> 01:28:23.958
Come on!

01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:27.128
Well, I could eat
a little something.

01:28:27.253 --> 01:28:29.297
I'm thirsty. Really?
Yeah, it's...

01:28:46.564 --> 01:28:47.773
Come on!

01:29:05.124 --> 01:29:06.125
Where are you from?

01:29:06.209 --> 01:29:07.210
Chicago. You?

01:29:07.293 --> 01:29:08.502
Boston.

01:29:10.171 --> 01:29:11.881
Anyway, I'm Elizabeth.

01:29:11.964 --> 01:29:13.299
I'm Paris.

01:29:16.636 --> 01:29:18.971
Um, are they staying?

01:29:22.767 --> 01:29:24.310
Right.
We're going.

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:26.145
Call me
on the FaceTimes.

01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:27.480
Don't forget to eat.

01:29:27.563 --> 01:29:28.814
Call me
when you need me.

01:29:30.441 --> 01:29:31.442
Bye.

01:29:31.984 --> 01:29:33.903
Bye-bye! Okay.

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.613
Okay, let's go.
All right.

01:29:35.696 --> 01:29:36.697
Bye, honey. Bye.

01:29:36.781 --> 01:29:38.199

- Bye, honey.

01:29:38.282 --> 01:29:40.493

Bye.

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:44.163
Bye. Bye.

01:29:44.664 --> 01:29:45.915
- Bye.
- Let's go, honey.

01:29:45.998 --> 01:29:47.124
