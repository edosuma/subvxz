00:42.193 --> 00:43.306
Coming!

00:54.519 --> 00:55.759
Hey, mom.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.346
Has he told you
how long he's staying?

01:13.447 --> 01:14.847
No, and I didn't ask him.

01:14.915 --> 01:17.116
I didn't want him
to think it was an option.

01:17.184 --> 01:19.618
As far as I'm concerned,
I'll find him some money,

01:19.720 --> 01:21.721
and then he can get on his way.

01:27.461 --> 01:28.594
Your toast is done.

01:28.695 --> 01:31.097
Yeah.
I know.

01:34.501 --> 01:37.503
I don't suppose
you want some breakfast?

01:37.537 --> 01:38.904
Thanks, no.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.811
The bread's gonna get stale.

01:53.553 --> 01:56.422
Why are you here?

01:57.924 --> 02:00.159
Because that's what
normal people do, Norma,

02:00.260 --> 02:02.695
when they've lost their job,
and they've got no money

02:02.763 --> 02:04.830
and no place to stay.

02:04.931 --> 02:06.899
They go home.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.467
Although most normal mothers

02:08.568 --> 02:09.889
don't move their home
out of state

02:09.902 --> 02:13.339
and try and hide it
from their own son.

02:13.407 --> 02:15.908
We're out of cream.

02:24.217 --> 02:26.118
He looked like a lost puppy
at the party.

02:27.220 --> 02:30.890
Shh, he's coming.

02:37.497 --> 02:40.633
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:40.734 --> 02:41.967
So the other night,

02:42.035 --> 02:44.136
why'd you leave the party
so early?

02:44.237 --> 02:46.072
Where did you go?
You hook up with someone?

02:46.139 --> 02:48.774
I'd like to lie to you
and say yes,

02:48.875 --> 02:50.443
but I actually
got my history book

02:50.510 --> 02:52.411
out of your car
and went home and--

02:52.512 --> 02:54.880
And probably studied.

02:54.948 --> 02:58.584
Good for you.
I hate studying.

02:58.685 --> 03:03.055
- A necessary evil.
- Yeah.

03:03.156 --> 03:04.857
You wanna actually
study together

03:04.925 --> 03:06.325
for the history test?

03:06.426 --> 03:09.328
I mean, not go to a party
this time.

03:09.429 --> 03:10.830
I could really use the help.

03:10.897 --> 03:14.033
Oh, my God, that guy
must be completely wasted.

03:18.071 --> 03:19.972
That's my dad's car.

03:36.690 --> 03:38.858
Dad! Dad!

03:38.959 --> 03:40.059
Oh, my God!

03:40.160 --> 03:41.560
Let me--let me--
let me get it.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.762
Hurry up!

03:55.809 --> 04:06.669

04:19.933 --> 04:21.733
His name's Jerry Martin.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.537
Owns a warehouse up the road.

04:24.638 --> 04:27.606
It looks like somebody
set a fire there.

04:27.674 --> 04:29.074
He was trapped inside of it.

04:29.142 --> 04:30.576
Wait, you're saying someone
intentionally

04:30.644 --> 04:32.478
set fire to his warehouse?

04:32.579 --> 04:35.581
That's horrible.

04:37.017 --> 04:38.684
Yes, you're right.
It's horrible.

04:38.752 --> 04:40.052
Sheriff!

04:40.120 --> 04:42.955
There's something here
you need to see.

04:52.465 --> 04:55.601
Interesting morning
in White Pine Bay.

04:55.669 --> 04:57.369
Burnt up dude
drives into a ditch

04:57.470 --> 04:59.772
in front of your new hotel?

04:59.873 --> 05:02.908
How rude.

05:03.009 --> 05:04.743
You know,
it's a really nice town

05:04.844 --> 05:06.579
you picked here, Norma,

05:06.680 --> 05:07.913
to start a new life and all,
you know?

05:08.014 --> 05:11.050
Stop calling me Norma.

05:15.055 --> 05:17.756
And if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna pitch in.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.658
I ordered
all-new bed linens.

05:19.759 --> 05:20.959
They're ready to be picked up.

05:20.994 --> 05:23.362
I'm gonna get you the car keys.

05:23.430 --> 05:24.863
Mrs. Bates.

05:24.965 --> 05:27.800
Could you come here, please?

05:34.975 --> 05:38.077
Yep, that's it.

05:41.581 --> 05:43.782
This is, uh--
this is Keith Summers's truck,

05:43.883 --> 05:45.484
used to own this place.

05:45.585 --> 05:46.986
He hasn't been home
in a couple of nights.

05:47.053 --> 05:48.654
Have you seen him?

05:48.722 --> 05:52.558
No.
No, I haven't.

05:52.626 --> 05:54.660
Why would he
leave his truck here?

05:54.728 --> 05:56.795
Well,
that's what we're wondering.

05:59.799 --> 06:01.800
All right, let's get everybody
down here by the truck.

06:01.901 --> 06:03.862
We're gonna search the woods
up here behind the house.

06:03.982 --> 06:05.223
Fine. Let's go!

06:11.511 --> 06:14.813
Well, good luck
with everything.

06:21.454 --> 06:23.055
So I want you to select a poem

06:23.156 --> 06:25.491
from one of these classic poets

06:25.558 --> 06:28.060
and prepare a presentation
on why this poem

06:28.161 --> 06:30.029
is still relevant
in today's world.

06:30.096 --> 06:31.897
Now this
is a partner assignment,

06:31.998 --> 06:33.632
so I want you to figure out
who you wanna work with.

06:37.737 --> 06:40.839
Hey.
Wanna do this with me?

06:40.907 --> 06:42.508
Yeah, okay.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.910
Good.
We can meet tomorrow.

06:45.011 --> 06:47.646
Cool.

06:47.747 --> 06:49.867
You live at the motel, right?
I'll come to your place.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.450
Oh, well,
maybe we should--

06:51.551 --> 06:55.187
11:00. I'll be there.

07:13.473 --> 07:16.475
Dr. Klonkin.
Dr. Klonkin.

07:27.587 --> 07:30.556
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

07:34.494 --> 07:36.362
So why are you here?

07:36.463 --> 07:38.997
I just felt bad about
what happened to Bradley's dad.

07:39.099 --> 07:42.601
- And I was there.
- Yeah, I know.

07:42.702 --> 07:44.570
Well, I just wanted
to give her this.

07:44.671 --> 07:47.506
I'll give it to her.

07:47.607 --> 07:49.341
Great.
Yeah, okay.

07:49.409 --> 07:51.510
Yeah, thank you.

It's not.

09:34.481 --> 09:35.721
You're not gonna be coming home

09:35.748 --> 09:37.483
in the middle of the night
like this.

09:37.584 --> 09:40.986
Okay? I am trying to build
a life here for me and Norman.

09:41.087 --> 09:43.889
You are not going
to be screwing this up.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.924
I got it, okay?

09:46.025 --> 09:49.795
I grew up in a house
with you, remember?

09:49.863 --> 09:52.931
It was always what you
were trying to do for Norman.

09:53.032 --> 09:54.867
Norman is a good boy.

09:54.934 --> 09:56.468
He's a good son.

09:56.569 --> 09:59.771
Dylan, would you please
put that on a plate?

10:01.107 --> 10:02.674
Well, golly, you know,

10:02.775 --> 10:04.495
I'm sorry if I was
a little annoyed with you

10:04.511 --> 10:05.878
after you drove my dad away

10:05.945 --> 10:07.646
by skanking around
with Norman's father.

10:07.747 --> 10:09.515
I wasn't skanking around.
It wasn't my fault.

10:09.582 --> 10:11.483
I was 17 years old
when I met your father.

10:11.584 --> 10:12.784
I had no idea what I was doing.

10:12.785 --> 10:14.520
I met Sam, and I fell in love.

10:14.587 --> 10:16.054
Oh, yeah?

10:16.155 --> 10:18.524
How'd that work out for you?

10:18.591 --> 10:20.526
I hate you.

10:20.593 --> 10:21.960
I hate you.

10:22.061 --> 10:23.929
You have never had
an ounce of kindness for me.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.398
Well, I'm sorry
it was a little bit hard

10:26.499 --> 10:27.766
to get on the tea party
with you and Norbit.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.547
What are you talking about?
What tea party?

10:29.602 --> 10:32.471
He likes me. He just likes me,
so we are close.

10:32.572 --> 10:35.040
That is the normal arrangement
between mothers and sons,

10:35.141 --> 10:39.545
not this crap.

10:39.612 --> 10:43.582
How'd you get
all this money, Norma?

10:43.683 --> 10:47.052
How'd you buy a motel
and a new car?

10:47.153 --> 10:49.788
We haven't had a dime
in our life, okay?

10:49.889 --> 10:53.158
I've been worried about money
since I was conscious.

10:53.259 --> 10:55.727
What's up with that, huh?

10:55.795 --> 10:57.796
Sam's insurance policy.

10:57.897 --> 11:02.467
He sold insurance,
and he was well covered.

11:02.535 --> 11:06.171
Yeah, I guess so.

11:08.174 --> 11:12.044
Good night, Norma.

11:12.145 --> 11:14.452
Stop calling me Norma.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.915
I am your mother!

11:21.824 --> 11:24.027
Get all the corners and the edges.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.668
I think we're good.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.336
Just 'cause they found his car

11:27.437 --> 11:29.810
doesn't mean
they're necessarily gonna--

11:30.795 --> 11:34.510
Don't you two
ever get tired of each other?

11:40.817 --> 11:42.618
These are good.

11:46.417 --> 11:47.884
I got it, gang, it's cool.

11:47.985 --> 11:50.086
Don't stop your swiffering.

11:55.059 --> 11:58.828
Hi. I'm here
to study with Norman.

12:01.465 --> 12:05.769
Hey, Norman,
there's a girl here for you.

12:05.836 --> 12:07.570
Come in.

12:10.574 --> 12:13.009
Hi, Norman.

12:14.578 --> 12:16.112
Oh, hey, Emma.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.981
This is my mom.
Emma.

12:18.082 --> 12:20.450
We're doing a language arts
project together at school.

12:20.551 --> 12:22.085
I guess I forgot to tell you.

12:22.186 --> 12:24.554
- I'm Dylan.
- Well, that's okay then.

12:24.655 --> 12:27.056
Come on in.
It's nice to meet you.

12:27.124 --> 12:29.793
- You too.
- Where do you live, Emma?

12:29.860 --> 12:31.394
My dad has a shop
in the village.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.430
We live in the space above it.

12:33.497 --> 12:34.578
Did we land on a poem yet?

12:34.665 --> 12:36.266
What's your last name?

12:36.367 --> 12:38.034
Decody.
No, but I brought some books.

12:38.135 --> 12:39.269
"Decody."
Is that Italian?

12:39.370 --> 12:40.937
No, no, it isn't.

12:41.038 --> 12:43.006
We're from the U.K.,
actually.

12:43.107 --> 12:45.375
Hey, mom, uh,
didn't you--

12:45.476 --> 12:47.076
didn't you need me
to go to the grocery store?

12:47.144 --> 12:48.511
- Come sit down.
- Do you have that list?

12:48.579 --> 12:50.180
Have a seat.
No, I haven't made it yet.

12:50.214 --> 12:51.781
Oh.

12:51.849 --> 12:54.217
So how long
have you lived here?

12:54.318 --> 12:55.852
About five years.

12:55.953 --> 12:57.987
My dad was a professor
in Manchester.

12:58.055 --> 13:00.023
- He was a professor?
- Yeah.

13:00.124 --> 13:02.258
But he wanted to spend time
just focusing

13:02.326 --> 13:04.427
on taking care of me,
so he retired

13:04.495 --> 13:06.095
and opened the shop.

13:06.197 --> 13:07.764
And are you okay?

13:07.865 --> 13:10.133
Oh, this?

13:10.234 --> 13:12.068
Yeah.
It's my pet.

13:12.136 --> 13:15.238
I take it everywhere.

13:15.339 --> 13:16.539
I have C.F.

13:16.607 --> 13:18.141
Mom.

13:18.242 --> 13:20.276
Mm.
I have--

13:20.344 --> 13:22.545
I have heard of it,
but I don't know

13:22.613 --> 13:24.280
what it is, exactly.
I don't know.

13:24.348 --> 13:26.816
Well, cystic fibrosis
is when your lungs

13:26.884 --> 13:28.485
create a lot
of this thick mucous,

13:28.586 --> 13:30.353
and it makes it
really hard to breathe--

13:30.421 --> 13:33.223
some would say impossible.

13:33.324 --> 13:35.024
I'm on a list
for a lung transplant,

13:35.125 --> 13:37.460
but that comes
with its own demons.

13:37.528 --> 13:40.363
And God knows
if I'll ever get one in time.

13:40.431 --> 13:43.399
Well, I hope you do.

13:47.171 --> 13:49.172
What is
your life expectancy, Emma?

13:49.273 --> 13:52.208
Maybe 27.

13:52.276 --> 13:54.544
Hmm.

14:02.553 --> 14:04.153
Well, why don't you two
go upstairs,

14:04.255 --> 14:05.455
do your homework?

14:05.556 --> 14:07.490
And you let me know
if you get hungry.

14:19.003 --> 14:20.937
Do you think
that she has to take that thing

14:21.005 --> 14:22.872
out of her nose
when they make out?

14:29.613 --> 14:32.615
How about this?
<i>The Tiger.</i>

14:35.286 --> 14:38.988
It's a classic.

14:39.056 --> 14:41.291
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright

14:41.392 --> 14:43.526
"in the forest of the night.

14:43.627 --> 14:45.461
"What immortal hand or eye

14:45.563 --> 14:49.566
could frame
thy fearful symmetry?"

14:49.667 --> 14:54.037
And what does it mean?

14:54.104 --> 14:55.505
It's about how could a God,

14:55.573 --> 14:57.774
who made all this beautiful
stuff in the world,

14:57.841 --> 15:01.411
also make things
that are scary and evil?

15:01.478 --> 15:02.879
It could work.

15:02.947 --> 15:04.247
We could talk about it in terms

15:04.315 --> 15:05.915
of famous contemporary murders,

15:06.016 --> 15:10.019
like O.J. or--
or Charles Manson.

15:13.223 --> 15:16.225
"What the hammer,
what the chain,

15:16.327 --> 15:18.828
"in what furnace was thy brain?

15:18.929 --> 15:21.898
"What the anvil,
what dread grasp,

15:21.966 --> 15:24.968
dare its deadly terrors
clasp?"

15:29.573 --> 15:30.873
What's this?

15:30.941 --> 15:33.109
Oh, it's nothing.

15:33.210 --> 15:36.579
I don't care.

15:39.249 --> 15:42.819
Wow, these pictures
are amazing.

15:42.886 --> 15:44.887
Did you draw these?

15:44.955 --> 15:46.796
No. No, I found it
in one of the motel rooms.

15:46.890 --> 15:48.791
I didn't know
what to do with it, so--

15:48.892 --> 15:50.994
Oh, please.
I've read a lot of manga--

15:51.061 --> 15:54.130
a lot steamier than this.

15:54.231 --> 15:56.132
Can I borrow it?

15:56.233 --> 15:59.102
Sure.

15:59.169 --> 16:02.171
Thanks.

16:56.994 --> 17:00.063
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry to be in a robe.

17:00.164 --> 17:01.764
You caught me
getting ready for bed.

17:01.832 --> 17:03.499
Yeah, we need to ask you
some questions.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.202
Sure, sure, ask away.

17:08.372 --> 17:10.440
The other morning
when we were out here,

17:10.540 --> 17:13.076
you said you hadn't seen
Keith Summers.

17:13.176 --> 17:15.511
Yes, that's correct.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.781
But we have an eyewitness
who was driving by here

17:18.848 --> 17:20.116
who said he saw him

17:20.217 --> 17:22.218
standing right here
on your front lawn

17:22.286 --> 17:25.054
and that you and your son
were talking to him...

17:25.122 --> 17:27.022
And it looked a little heated.

17:27.124 --> 17:29.058
Well, yes,
I mean, I'm--

17:29.126 --> 17:32.061
I didn't know that you had meant
had I ever seen him.

17:32.129 --> 17:33.289
I thought you meant recently.

17:33.363 --> 17:35.271
Well, some people might think

17:35.391 --> 17:38.768
in the last week
as being recently.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.525
Yeah, some people might.

17:41.626 --> 17:42.893
So you're admitting
you did see him?

17:42.994 --> 17:44.929
No, I never said
I hadn't ever seen him,

17:45.030 --> 17:46.731
so I'm not admitting anything.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.666
Did he make any--
any threats to you or--

17:48.767 --> 17:51.469
Threats? No. Why if he had,
I would've called the police.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.405
Because he wasn't too happy
about you waltzing in

17:54.473 --> 17:55.773
and buying his property
at a foreclosure.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.108
Well, you know, the fact

17:57.209 --> 17:58.743
that I bought this property
at a good price

17:58.844 --> 18:00.224
hardly incriminates me
in his disappearance.

18:00.344 --> 18:01.883
He disappeared?

18:02.003 --> 18:03.914
I-I don't remember
bringing up a disappearance.

18:04.015 --> 18:05.383
No, but you're implying it.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.952
No, I believe
you're inferring it.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.695
That's all the information
I have, so...

18:17.763 --> 18:19.497
- is that it?
- Actually, no.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.965
I'd like to take a look around,
if you don't mind.

18:21.032 --> 18:22.767
Actually, I do mind.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.001
I think you need
a search warrant

18:24.102 --> 18:26.504
for something like that, right?

18:26.605 --> 18:27.972
I mean, based on something

18:28.039 --> 18:29.940
more than just
some meaningless conversation

18:30.041 --> 18:32.553
out on my motel front lawn,
right?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.719
You better work with me, okay?

18:41.787 --> 18:45.756
I'm the last guy
you want on your bad side.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.772
Okay.

19:13.696 --> 19:15.597
♪ Baby girl, don't be shy ♪

19:15.698 --> 19:18.400

Deputy Shelby?

19:35.373 --> 19:38.375
Hey, you guys
be safe today, yeah?

19:40.278 --> 19:43.280
- Hello, Mrs. Bates.
- Hello, go ahead.

19:43.381 --> 19:46.083
Slap the handcuffs on.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.118
Well, that is Romero.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.254
That's just his style,
you know?

19:50.355 --> 19:51.755
He's a dog with a bone,

19:51.823 --> 19:53.857
so I wouldn't take it
too personally.

19:53.925 --> 19:57.094
Yeah, I tell you,
it's a little hard not to.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.097
I know.

19:58.217 --> 20:02.232
Well, I'm sorry.
Um...

20:02.300 --> 20:04.335
Hey, would you let me
buy you a cup of coffee,

20:04.436 --> 20:09.106
maybe, as a gesture
of goodwill?

20:09.207 --> 20:10.374
Sure.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:13.945 --> 20:16.180
It was horrible for Norman
to lose his father.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.249
And I came here
because I wanted

20:19.351 --> 20:20.851
to clean the slate for him.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.720
You know, I wanted him--

20:22.821 --> 20:24.088
I wanted to give him
a new life.

20:24.189 --> 20:26.223
- I wanted to give him hope.
- Sure, yeah.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.460
And let's just say

20:29.561 --> 20:33.297
that gets
a little bit compromised

20:33.398 --> 20:37.801
when Sheriff Bulldog
is standing on my porch

20:37.869 --> 20:40.104
and he's making all kinds
of accusations.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.073
First of all, to be fair,

20:43.141 --> 20:45.442
I really don't think
he was making accusations.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.379
I do--no, I do think
that you were inferring that.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.781
Oh, no.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.350
Now we're back to that again?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.885
Okay, Romero.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.754
He grew up with Keith Summers.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.889
They were boyhood pals,
you know?

20:58.957 --> 21:00.090
So they spent
a lot of time together

21:00.158 --> 21:01.692
doin' a whole lot of nothing,

21:01.793 --> 21:06.063
and you get close
to people that way, so--

21:06.131 --> 21:08.399
so Keith's disappearance,
you know, this is--

21:08.500 --> 21:10.067
it's very personal to him.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.236
I can understand that.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.904
Hey, deputy.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.272
We gonna see you
at the Woodchuck tonight?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.907
Absolutely, yeah,
wouldn't miss it.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.308
- Right on, man.
- All right.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.210
Woodchuck? What on earth
is the Woodchuck?

21:20.311 --> 21:23.447
Yeah, the Woodchuck
is this stupid,

21:23.515 --> 21:27.217
but very fun,
local sort of festival.

21:27.318 --> 21:29.853
It's left over from when
this used to be a logging town.

21:29.954 --> 21:32.289
- Sounds charming.
- Yeah, no, it is, actually.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.992
It is.
You should come.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.828
Yeah, okay.
I would love to.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.496
Great.

21:39.597 --> 21:41.198
Um...

21:43.902 --> 21:46.937
I just--
I really can't--

21:47.005 --> 21:49.106
I mean, I couldn't take you,

21:49.174 --> 21:52.109
you know, 'cause of the whole
Keith Summers, the whole--

21:52.177 --> 21:56.780
But, I mean,
we could meet there, right?

21:56.881 --> 22:01.118
Because, I mean...
I'm going.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.187
You're going, so...

22:04.923 --> 22:08.358
Just a thought.

22:13.898 --> 22:14.832
How does this look?

22:14.899 --> 22:16.200
For what?

22:16.267 --> 22:17.968
I'm meeting
Deputy Shelby in town.

22:18.069 --> 22:20.204
Does this top look like
I'm trying too hard?

22:20.271 --> 22:21.972
That depends
on what you're trying.

22:22.073 --> 22:24.007
Ah, I didn't want
to have to tell you this.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.044
I didn't want you to worry.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.449
The police came by last night.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.952
Apparently someone saw us
talking to Keith Summers outside

22:35.019 --> 22:36.419
after I specifically
told the police

22:36.454 --> 22:38.122
that we hadn't seen him.
Mom, that's-

22:38.189 --> 22:39.990
I know, it's not good.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.452
I think I dodged it
for the moment,

22:41.493 --> 22:44.695
but I don't think it's over.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.830
Deputy seems to like us,

22:46.931 --> 22:49.299
so I'm gonna go
on a goodwill mission.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.002
I'm meeting him
at a community event in town.

22:52.103 --> 22:54.138
Hmm.

22:54.205 --> 22:56.373
Norman, please.

22:56.474 --> 23:00.310
I'm just doing
what I need to do.

23:00.411 --> 23:03.947
This one's better, right?

23:13.558 --> 23:18.228
Lord, Norman, I'm your mother.

23:18.329 --> 23:22.199
It's not like it's weird
or anything.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.275
You don't have to do this, mom.

23:31.342 --> 23:33.022
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not "doing" anything.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.845
I ran into him in town,

23:34.946 --> 23:36.013
and I'm just gonna go
hang out for a bit.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.314
No, I don't want you to go.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.449
- Honey, you're overreacting.
- Fine.

23:39.517 --> 23:40.951
- It's a community thing?
- Yes.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.152
- I'll go with you.
- No.

23:42.253 --> 23:43.821
- Yeah.
- No.

23:43.888 --> 23:47.024
No, you're not going with me,
and you know it.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.826
It's fine, Norman.

23:48.893 --> 23:50.394
It doesn't mean anything.

23:50.495 --> 23:54.164
It's not like I'm actually
interested in him.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.802
I don't want you to worry
about this.

23:58.903 --> 24:00.671
I don't want you to worry
about anything.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.673
That's why I'm doing this.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.442
- Okay, mom.
- Okay?

24:07.445 --> 24:10.814
It's all gonna be good.

24:26.613 --> 24:29.448
Hey, Gil.

24:31.951 --> 24:33.452
This is Dylan Massett.

24:33.519 --> 24:36.321
He's the guy
I was telling you about.

24:36.422 --> 24:39.424
So, Dylan...

24:39.525 --> 24:42.527
you know how to use a gun?

24:44.530 --> 24:48.166
Yeah.

24:50.603 --> 24:53.472
- What's for dinner, honey?
- Screw off.

24:53.539 --> 24:56.174
And I didn't make it.
Mom made it.

24:58.177 --> 24:59.411
Crap.
We're out of beer.

25:04.183 --> 25:06.418
Apparently "the whore"
is calling you.

25:11.624 --> 25:13.258
Hi, Norma.

25:13.359 --> 25:14.860
Yeah, I met with the plumber,

25:14.928 --> 25:17.062
and I got the quotes
for the new toilets.

25:17.163 --> 25:19.498
Yeah, it's in the kitchen.

25:19.565 --> 25:23.335
Okay, fine, fine.
Yes.

25:23.403 --> 25:25.771
Don't you ever
call our mother a whore!

25:25.838 --> 25:29.107
Get the hell off of me!

25:29.208 --> 25:31.109
What do you think you're doing?

25:31.210 --> 25:33.045
You're a damn joke, Norman.

25:33.112 --> 25:35.113
You let that bitch
run you like a puppet.

25:35.214 --> 25:36.848
She doesn't run me.
She cares about me.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.884
And she's not a bad person,

25:38.952 --> 25:40.852
she's just not perfect!

25:40.954 --> 25:43.355
At least she tries,
you son of a bitch!

25:44.924 --> 25:46.325
You don't get it,
do you, Norman?

25:46.392 --> 25:48.327
She's ruined you.

25:48.394 --> 25:50.362
If you hate her so much,
why the hell

25:50.463 --> 25:52.297
do you wanna stay here?

25:52.398 --> 25:55.600
Because I've got
nowhere else to go!

25:57.303 --> 25:59.905
But don't you come at me again,
or I will hurt you bad.

26:00.006 --> 26:03.475
Do you understand?

26:50.256 --> 26:53.558
I told you not to do that.

27:02.535 --> 27:05.537
She's not a whore.

27:30.443 --> 27:32.544
- Great job.
- That's awesome.

27:33.713 --> 27:36.215
♪ I can see why you think ♪

27:36.316 --> 27:37.716

- Look at you.
- Oh!

27:40.687 --> 27:43.388
See, I told you, this is--
it's stupid.

27:45.158 --> 27:47.226
You know, there are
a million reasons

27:47.327 --> 27:49.328
why Keith Summers
could have disappeared.

27:49.903 --> 27:52.004
He probably landed
in a ditch somewhere

27:52.105 --> 27:56.208
as a result of some bad crap
that he got into.

27:56.309 --> 27:58.210
You mean, illegal stuff?

27:58.311 --> 28:02.481
Let's just say that
he was a train wreck in general.

28:02.582 --> 28:03.716
♪ Amie ♪

28:03.817 --> 28:05.184
You know, I had such high hopes

28:05.285 --> 28:08.854
when I came here to make a home
for me and Norman.

28:08.922 --> 28:12.891
And things just keep happening,
weird things,

28:12.959 --> 28:14.994
you know?

28:15.095 --> 28:19.632
It's like this,
but...it's not like this.

28:22.020 --> 28:24.670
Look, nowhere is like this.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.223
I mean,
not all the way through.

28:27.343 --> 28:30.009
Have you noticed what
these people do for a living?

28:30.110 --> 28:34.046
Artisanal cheese,
organic pig farms.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.815
And yet, most of these people,
somehow,

28:36.883 --> 28:38.884
they're all living
in million-dollar homes.

28:38.952 --> 28:41.420
They're driving European cars.

28:41.488 --> 28:44.757
The town, it was built
on the logging industry,

28:44.858 --> 28:48.494
but all that collapsed
with the tree huggers.

28:48.595 --> 28:51.630
I'm just saying
that there are...

28:51.698 --> 28:56.035
there's different ways
to produce an economy,

28:56.136 --> 29:01.840
and it's not always
what it seems.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.476
But surely you can't allow
illegal things,

29:04.577 --> 29:06.011
bad things to happen here.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.946
The people in this town,

29:08.048 --> 29:10.616
they deal with things
in a different way,

29:10.717 --> 29:15.087
but it gets dealt with.

29:15.155 --> 29:17.856
And what about the guy
who was burned?

29:17.957 --> 29:22.461
It'll be dealt with.
An eye for an eye.

29:22.529 --> 29:25.531
It'll get handled.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.037
The boat sails
for New York in 20 minutes.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.605
- Let it sail.
- Look, Mastermind,

29:33.707 --> 29:34.640
the tour is over.

29:34.708 --> 29:35.808
We've been posse-baitin'

29:35.909 --> 29:36.975
every town from coast to coast,

29:37.077 --> 29:38.237
and we just ran out of towns.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.212
Norman?

29:44.551 --> 29:46.719
What on earth happened to you?

29:46.820 --> 29:49.788
Oh, Dylan and I just
got into a fight.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.657
It's not a big deal.

29:51.725 --> 29:53.258
It absolutely is a big deal.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.694
Look at your sweet face.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.763
This is awful.
What happened?

29:57.831 --> 29:59.031
I don't even know, mom.

29:59.099 --> 30:02.101
We just don't get along.

30:11.211 --> 30:14.780
He's gonna have to leave.

30:14.848 --> 30:16.615
He can't come into our lives

30:16.716 --> 30:17.883
and disrupt them like this.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.618
He can't talk to us
the way he does.

30:19.719 --> 30:21.920
And he can't hurt you.
I will not stand for it.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.556
I won't.

30:24.657 --> 30:28.193
Maybe it would be
the best thing.

30:32.265 --> 30:35.267
Get some sleep, sweetheart.

31:47.173 --> 31:50.075
Oh, hey.
Cool. You came.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.612
You said it was important.

31:53.713 --> 31:55.981
Holy crap.
What happened to your face?

31:56.082 --> 31:58.750
Oh, I fell down the stairs,
you know,

31:58.818 --> 32:01.253
those long stairs
in front of our house.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.921
It's okay.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.491
You don't have to tell me.

32:05.592 --> 32:09.027
Thanks.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.897
So what's with
all the stuffed animals?

32:11.998 --> 32:13.732
Are they real?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.834
They were once.

32:15.902 --> 32:17.903
My dad does it.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.038
He's one of the best taxidermy
artists on the west coast.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.773
But enough
about stuffing dead animals.

32:21.875 --> 32:23.942
Sit down.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.611
I'm gonna tell you
a little story

32:25.712 --> 32:28.814
about real, living things.

32:28.915 --> 32:31.683
Four girls from Shunyi, China,

32:31.751 --> 32:34.920
get told that, if they come
to America illegally

32:35.021 --> 32:36.941
and work as housemaids,
they will get citizenship

32:36.990 --> 32:38.457
in seven years.

32:38.558 --> 32:40.559
But they aren't gonna be maids.

32:40.660 --> 32:43.495
They are forced to have sex
with different men every day.

32:43.563 --> 32:45.564
One of them
dies from an overdose.

32:45.665 --> 32:47.733
They force the other girls
to carry her body

32:47.834 --> 32:49.768
into the hills, dig a grave,
and then bury her

32:49.836 --> 32:52.571
by a shed in the trees.

32:53.740 --> 32:55.007
This is a pretty wild story.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.608
Wild, yes, and not over.

32:56.676 --> 32:58.644
So eventually,
after they have been sampled,

32:58.745 --> 33:02.814
they are sold one by one
into sex slavery.

33:02.916 --> 33:05.083
Look at this.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.252
That's Ladyface.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.656
It's a mountain
just outside of White Pine Bay.

33:10.757 --> 33:12.057
My dad's shown it to me before.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.560
It really exists.

33:14.661 --> 33:16.228
And?

33:16.296 --> 33:19.131
Someone did this
to these girls, Norman,

33:19.232 --> 33:22.568
and we can prove it.

33:22.669 --> 33:25.938
We can find the spot
and find the grave.

33:26.039 --> 33:29.942
Then we'll know
if it's real or not.

33:32.879 --> 33:38.650
This is all a little peculiar.

33:38.751 --> 33:43.221
No.
You know what's peculiar?

33:43.323 --> 33:46.975
A 17-year-old boy
using the word "peculiar."

34:05.712 --> 34:08.714

It's the middle of the night.

35:16.215 --> 35:19.985
Just having a cocktail
and listening

35:20.086 --> 35:21.726
to some of the previous owner's
old music.

35:25.758 --> 35:27.693
You?

35:27.760 --> 35:29.895
Hey, I saw
what you did to Norman.

35:29.996 --> 35:34.666
You can't stay here.
You're toxic.

35:34.767 --> 35:37.502
You're leaving in the morning.

35:39.672 --> 35:42.674
How did Sam die, Norma?

35:46.112 --> 35:48.880
You know, it's funny.

35:48.948 --> 35:52.984
Because I had to do
a lot of research to find out

35:53.052 --> 35:55.220
where you guys had moved to.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.090
And I wound up talking
to one of the insurance people,

35:58.191 --> 36:00.625
and they talked

36:00.693 --> 36:03.862
about how sad it was
that Sam had died

36:03.963 --> 36:08.200
and what a wonderful husband
and father he was.

36:08.301 --> 36:12.971
And then, I thought,
you know, "Hmm.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.540
"Wouldn't it be interesting

36:15.608 --> 36:19.144
if I told them what life
with Sam was really like?"

37:28.638 --> 37:31.640
Let's go.

38:04.505 --> 38:08.243
Crap.
This is a big mountain.

38:08.344 --> 38:09.611
Where's that shed?

38:12.381 --> 38:14.950
We should take a break
for a second.

38:21.023 --> 38:23.959
It's okay for you
to be doing this, right?

38:24.026 --> 38:25.950
Totally.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.733
Fine.

38:28.853 --> 38:31.831
I'm okay.

38:32.339 --> 38:36.075
It's cool up here.

38:37.945 --> 38:42.482
My dad, he taught me
this meditation

38:42.583 --> 38:45.351
where first you imagine
your spirit

38:45.452 --> 38:47.587
rising up out of your body,

38:47.688 --> 38:49.322
then out of your house,

38:49.423 --> 38:52.725
out of your town,
out of the sky,

38:52.793 --> 38:55.295
like a golden light
zooming and growing,

38:55.362 --> 38:57.697
out into, and even past,
the universe.

38:57.798 --> 39:00.874
And from that point,
you look back

39:00.994 --> 39:05.505
and you realize how small
you are in the world.

39:05.606 --> 39:07.407
Don't you feel like that
up here, Norman?

39:07.508 --> 39:08.829
That you're connected
to something

39:08.876 --> 39:11.878
so much larger than ourselves?

39:28.996 --> 39:30.697
What the hell is that?

39:30.798 --> 39:32.999
Holy crap.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.635
It's one of the pot fields.
I've heard about them,

39:35.736 --> 39:37.270
but I've never
actually seen one.

39:37.371 --> 39:39.605
What pot fields?
What are you talking about?

39:39.673 --> 39:40.840
Hey! Hey!

39:40.941 --> 39:41.941
What the hell
are you doing there?

39:42.009 --> 39:43.810
Emma, we need to run.

39:43.911 --> 39:45.745
- Hey! Hey!
- We need to run.

39:48.649 --> 39:51.317
Come on.
Come on, Emma!

40:02.663 --> 40:05.298
Shh, get down.
Don't even breathe.

40:05.399 --> 40:06.899
Sorry.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.614
Aah!

40:29.323 --> 40:30.890
Aah!

40:35.029 --> 40:36.562
Norman, it's the shed.

40:36.663 --> 40:37.797
From the pictures.

40:37.865 --> 40:40.867
We can't stop now.

40:53.414 --> 40:54.714
Come on, Emma!

41:00.421 --> 41:02.588
Come on, Emma.

41:07.061 --> 41:08.961
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

41:10.964 --> 41:12.365
Go, go, go!

41:12.433 --> 41:13.800
Come on!

41:13.901 --> 41:16.436
Go, go!

41:32.886 --> 41:33.986
Keep moving, let's go.

41:34.088 --> 41:37.356
Let's go, let's go, come on.

41:50.804 --> 41:53.539
Let's go.
Let's go.
