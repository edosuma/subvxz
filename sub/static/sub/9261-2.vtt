WEBVTT

00:01.706 --> 00:02.860
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield <i>...</i>

00:03.014 --> 00:05.247
He screwed my ex wife
with the sole purpose

00:05.398 --> 00:09.259
of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.143
This guy's just pissing,
he's pissing all over us.

00:12.307 --> 00:14.594
I've made you coffee
and I've been patient,

00:14.812 --> 00:15.829
you need to go.

00:18.170 --> 00:19.910
Okay. Stop, stop. Stop!

00:20.093 --> 00:21.093
I'm gonna take a deal.

00:21.252 --> 00:22.986
I report for processing
tomorrow morning.

00:23.145 --> 00:24.730
We gotta wait for you to get to mexico.

00:24.893 --> 00:26.650
We got money parked
in an account for you.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.753
- It's all set up.
- I'm not going that route.

00:28.914 --> 00:30.308
They're gonna make you give us up.

00:30.479 --> 00:33.530
Why'd you even come back here tonight
if you weren't planning on leaving?

00:36.226 --> 00:37.243
Shane?

00:42.735 --> 00:44.513
We're gonna find out
who did this.

00:45.437 --> 00:46.723
And we're gonna kill him.

00:46.898 --> 00:49.343
It's Guardo, he stepped on
his protection twice.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.500
Killing Lem was a message to stay away.

00:51.668 --> 00:54.282
You've murdered two of
your own team members.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.533
You're done with Mackey.
You're off of it.

00:57.696 --> 01:00.083
I have proof that Vic
had Lemansky killed.

01:00.415 --> 01:05.000
I say that Vic used me as a middle man
to set up the hit on his guy.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.391
I'm just trying to get you
to tell the truth.

01:07.606 --> 01:09.451
It's just somebody else's
truth, that's all.

01:09.626 --> 01:10.930
You get Emolia to lie for you.

01:11.116 --> 01:13.980
You just stepped onto
an entirely new playing field.

01:14.185 --> 01:15.861
I hope you know the rules of the game.

01:34.878 --> 01:36.910
Sorry.
Claudette had us running down a lead

01:37.118 --> 01:38.502
on the San Marcos house slaughter.

01:38.658 --> 01:40.220
I thought that was robbery/homicide.

01:40.406 --> 01:42.490
They'd get their loafers
dirty knocking on doors.

01:42.646 --> 01:43.661
Who's the bag of bones?

01:43.818 --> 01:46.821
Jupo Nunez. Founding father
of the salvadoran gang.

01:47.005 --> 01:50.780
Granted parole yesterday
after 50 years of a life sentence.

01:50.968 --> 01:51.962
Why the early release?

01:52.127 --> 01:53.141
He's terminal.

01:53.525 --> 01:54.550
Lung cancer.

02:02.905 --> 02:03.922
Hey.

02:04.517 --> 02:07.450
You think you can hang on long enough
to answer a few questions?

02:07.638 --> 02:09.731
- Do I know you?
- Vic Mackey.

02:09.928 --> 02:11.142
You're before my time.

02:11.527 --> 02:13.412
But your male nurse
probably heard of me.

02:14.358 --> 02:16.153
He's the Farmington cop, grandpa.

02:16.315 --> 02:17.842
Had the run-ins with Guardo.

02:18.335 --> 02:20.243
You're the one raging war against us.

02:20.426 --> 02:21.851
Come to tear down a dying man?

02:22.028 --> 02:23.310
My beef's with Guardo.

02:24.076 --> 02:25.511
He calls the shots now.

02:25.787 --> 02:27.791
I built this gang from the ground up.

02:28.196 --> 02:30.900
Guardo, all of them, owe me everything.

02:31.065 --> 02:33.333
Leaving you here to live in paradise.

02:33.645 --> 02:35.291
After a lifetime of service.

02:35.806 --> 02:37.200
That's one hell of a pension plan.

02:38.567 --> 02:39.863
You came here to insult me?

02:40.028 --> 02:42.791
I came here to give you a chance
to salvage your life's work.

02:44.108 --> 02:45.110
Now you give me Guardo.

02:45.288 --> 02:48.683
I turn on one of my own,
I disgrace myself.

02:48.876 --> 02:50.453
The salvadorans lost their honor

02:50.635 --> 02:52.061
after Guardo killed a cop.

02:52.608 --> 02:53.623
You old school guys.

02:53.797 --> 02:55.070
You knew never to do that.

02:55.286 --> 02:57.493
And in return, we showed
you a level of respect.

02:57.697 --> 03:00.140
Giving him up is a step towards
restoring the glory days.

03:00.476 --> 03:01.992
I don't know he killed one of you.

03:02.157 --> 03:03.643
We do. Besides,

03:03.845 --> 03:06.380
maybe your new leader would have
a better sense of history.

03:06.606 --> 03:08.071
How to treat their heroes.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.833
The new generation.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.663
No respect for the rules.

03:11.847 --> 03:13.091
That's disgraceful.

03:14.205 --> 03:15.252
What's worse is...

03:15.768 --> 03:17.182
Kids like your grandson here

03:17.366 --> 03:19.592
are gonna have to pay the
price for that disrespect.

03:19.836 --> 03:22.501
That gat he's hiding under his shirt,
that's a felony.

03:23.415 --> 03:26.362
Who knows what else I might find
if I decide to be a hardass.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.853
Guardo killed Danny Rosa.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.093
All I have is a number.

03:39.366 --> 03:41.903
It's where we call him
to give him a message.

03:49.825 --> 03:51.400
- Vic, it's Asher.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

03:51.567 --> 03:52.580
I'm at your house.

03:52.745 --> 03:53.842
Serving a search warrant.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.691
- For what?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

03:55.867 --> 03:56.883
Well, who's there?

03:57.045 --> 03:58.963
Kavanaugh, Wagenbach, Captain Wyms.

03:59.136 --> 04:01.821
Is there anything you need me to do?
Anything to clean up?

04:02.006 --> 04:03.402
No. There's nothing to find.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.201
Thanks for the heads up though.

04:05.367 --> 04:06.932
Jesus christ, Kavanaugh's at my place.

04:07.085 --> 04:08.190
He's got a search warrant.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.371
Based on the Emolia's bullshit story?

04:10.576 --> 04:13.412
Hey, hey.
Is there something that I need to know?

04:13.628 --> 04:15.291
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

04:16.398 --> 04:17.880
Is there anything there to find?

04:18.196 --> 04:20.130
- About Lem or anything else?
- No.

04:32.276 --> 04:33.573
Nothing in Vic's closet.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.413
- You?
- Just leftovers.

04:36.287 --> 04:37.402
Did you look in the trash?

04:37.936 --> 04:39.221
You see the brand new jacket?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.212
Garbage is what God made unis for.

04:42.097 --> 04:44.102
I thought you were gonna
take a personal day.

04:44.276 --> 04:45.283
It's thursday.

04:45.488 --> 04:47.933
I figured I take it tomorrow.
Get the three-days weekend.

04:49.068 --> 04:50.512
Check the bathroom, would you?

05:05.526 --> 05:06.553
Claudette!

05:07.865 --> 05:08.880
Claudette.

05:09.737 --> 05:11.580
- Yeah.
- Found this balled up in the trash.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.713
The circle there is where
Portillo autobody is.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.420
- Where Lemansky was killed.
- Yeah.

05:15.586 --> 05:17.223
Mackey said he'd never been there.

05:17.647 --> 05:19.741
Just keep looking.
Cause if he's this sloppy...

05:20.186 --> 05:21.190
maybe there's more.

05:23.276 --> 05:24.600
You've read the statement.

05:25.287 --> 05:26.660
You swear it's entirely truthful,

05:26.828 --> 05:28.442
everything about Detective Mackey?

05:30.278 --> 05:31.421
- Yes.
- OK.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.621
Sign and date here.

05:43.445 --> 05:45.863
Finished the search of
Vic's house and found these.

05:46.047 --> 05:48.360
This is a matchbook
from Tama's costora.

05:49.045 --> 05:50.262
Where Emolia's been working.

05:50.445 --> 05:52.091
Vic said he hadn't seen or spoken to her

05:52.255 --> 05:53.772
since he cut her off as an informant.

05:53.927 --> 05:56.291
Of course, we don't know
when he picked up the matchbook.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.702
$500 cash tucked inside
his yellow pages.

05:58.896 --> 06:00.920
Exact amount that Emolia said Vic

06:01.105 --> 06:02.551
offered to give Lem up to Guardo.

06:03.628 --> 06:05.603
Vic or any of the other
guys return our calls?

06:05.786 --> 06:08.131
- Not yet.
- Was the cash loose in the phone book?

06:08.315 --> 06:09.450
No. It was in that envelope.

06:09.617 --> 06:10.661
Send it to the crime lab.

06:10.818 --> 06:12.572
See if you can get
Vic's prints off of it.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.682
Fine. But if you ask me,
this is all bullshit.

06:14.927 --> 06:17.040
There's no way Vic offed
one of his own guys.

06:25.777 --> 06:27.202
Phone number tracks here.

06:27.377 --> 06:28.533
Nydia Hernandez.

06:28.686 --> 06:30.190
I knocked.
No one answered.

06:30.777 --> 06:31.813
So what now?

06:32.705 --> 06:33.851
We're gonna go inside.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.103
Wait for Guardo.

06:35.266 --> 06:36.661
Take him someplace private.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.820
Find out how he got close to Lem.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.601
Then we're gonna kill him.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.060
And anybody else involved.

06:47.113 --> 06:49.310
<i>All units stand by for crime broadcast.</i>

06:49.473 --> 06:51.763
<i>Wanted for questioning,
Detective Vic Mackey.</i>

06:51.944 --> 06:54.328
<i>Farmington Detectives.
Requesting any information</i>

06:54.509 --> 06:55.993
<i>on his current location.</i>

06:56.518 --> 06:58.392
They must have found
something in your house.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.603
There was nothing to find.

06:59.776 --> 07:01.221
Why else would they issue an APB?

07:01.387 --> 07:03.222
Look, why don't we just
go back to the barn,

07:03.375 --> 07:05.950
see what the hell they found,
and clean this mess up right now

07:06.118 --> 07:09.572
- before we dig ourselves in any deeper.
- Now might be our last shot at Guardo.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.312
He's right.

07:37.218 --> 07:38.442
We're all clear.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.942
Looks like she's Guardo's cooch.

07:41.145 --> 07:42.411
What are we gonna do with her?

07:43.398 --> 07:46.022
I don't have too much concern
for Guardo's loved ones.

08:00.716 --> 08:02.901
All right. Someone's here.
Don't get trigger happy.

08:03.086 --> 08:05.530
I want this guy alive long
enough to ask him questions.

08:18.025 --> 08:19.440
Hola.it's nydia.

08:21.247 --> 08:22.480
¿Esta Guardo?

08:28.417 --> 08:29.541
He's not there.

08:29.758 --> 08:30.770
Gracias.

08:34.538 --> 08:35.610
What's she doing now?

08:39.346 --> 08:40.741
She's making lunch.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.502
How's the new foot patrol going?

08:46.065 --> 08:48.803
It's OK, but community
relations is boring.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.183
We're not getting any action.

08:50.387 --> 08:52.672
Putting a friendly face
on the department is important.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.432
People need to feel comfortable
bringing their problems to us.

08:55.617 --> 08:57.152
Robbery/homicide faxed this over.

08:57.345 --> 08:59.443
It's a composite of the man
seen leaving the side

08:59.626 --> 09:00.951
of the San Marcos house murders.

09:01.118 --> 09:02.783
Get copies made.
Pass it along.

09:04.495 --> 09:08.130
If you're here to get an update on Vic,
I'm too busy.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.342
I'll try to find someone
to get you up to speed.

09:10.518 --> 09:13.771
Well, I might have to wait a while. Your
cupboard down there looks pretty bare.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.701
Half my men are out looking for Vic.
The other half are helping RHD

09:16.858 --> 09:18.223
with this house slaughter.

09:18.816 --> 09:22.061
Would it make your life any easier
if I could get you additional personnel?

09:22.517 --> 09:23.540
Cops I need.

09:23.715 --> 09:25.773
A future bill in my mailbox, I don't.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.842
You've been captain for a week.

09:28.028 --> 09:29.600
Your homicide rate's quadrupled.

09:29.768 --> 09:30.870
What are you talking about?

09:31.037 --> 09:32.861
The San Marcos triangle's
a no man's land

09:33.016 --> 09:35.252
between Wilshire,
Central and Farmington.

09:35.707 --> 09:38.931
The body count should've been
divided out in equal percentages.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.562
Their Captains managed
to dump all 12 on you.

09:42.475 --> 09:43.522
How'd they do that?

09:43.696 --> 09:44.962
You're low on the totem pole.

09:45.437 --> 09:46.463
Just happened.

09:48.555 --> 09:49.910
Crime stats will go down.

09:50.228 --> 09:52.290
All I need is time to make my input.

09:53.346 --> 09:55.211
Actually, things are
only gonna get tougher.

09:55.398 --> 09:56.830
The Mexican police authority

09:56.996 --> 09:58.811
is consolidating three prisons.

09:59.268 --> 10:01.722
So any inmates with 3 years
or less left on their sentences

10:01.875 --> 10:02.893
are being released.

10:03.608 --> 10:04.970
Based on their gang affiliations,

10:05.125 --> 10:07.163
you can expect a large
influx across the border

10:07.325 --> 10:08.542
and up in Farmington.

10:08.725 --> 10:10.172
Some are probably already here.

10:11.936 --> 10:12.943
OK.

10:13.436 --> 10:14.563
How does this work?

10:14.896 --> 10:16.702
I file the paperwork for a budget bump.

10:17.205 --> 10:19.031
As far as the Wilshire
and Central Captains,

10:19.196 --> 10:21.560
I'll try to persuade them
to even out the percentages

10:21.755 --> 10:23.950
so that our district
doesn't take the entire hit.

10:25.727 --> 10:26.742
It's that easy.

10:27.186 --> 10:29.390
No. But that's how it is.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.552
Now, uh, what can you
tell me about Mackey?

10:42.377 --> 10:44.600
Jesus, how long does it
take to eat a salad?

10:45.618 --> 10:47.423
We should be glad
she didn't take a dump.

10:50.497 --> 10:51.922
All right. She's gone.

10:57.446 --> 10:58.732
International prefix.

10:59.385 --> 11:01.290
Guardo's in mexico.
Goddammit.

11:01.478 --> 11:02.943
We're just gonna
have to wait then.

11:03.116 --> 11:04.132
Not necessarily.

11:04.318 --> 11:05.320
We can't rush this.

11:05.987 --> 11:07.011
We gotta handle it right.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.273
There's an APB out for me.
This doesn't wait.

11:13.647 --> 11:15.672
Look, neither one of you
can be seen with me.

11:18.186 --> 11:19.852
That means I gotta do this on my own.

11:20.395 --> 11:21.791
Why don't you go back to the barn.

11:21.975 --> 11:23.001
Be my eyes and ears.

11:23.327 --> 11:25.043
Gather as much intel
as you can.

11:40.516 --> 11:41.583
You lied to me, Aldo.

11:41.745 --> 11:43.631
You told me you didn't
know where Guardo was.

11:43.797 --> 11:46.323
You keep coming around here
asking questions, the salvadorans

11:46.488 --> 11:47.541
are going to sniff it out.

11:47.698 --> 11:49.530
- You want me killed?
- You lie to me again,

11:49.808 --> 11:50.763
I'll do it for them.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.282
Guardo's in San Miguel.

11:53.778 --> 11:54.793
Why?

11:55.318 --> 11:57.040
Last favor I have to do for you.

11:58.005 --> 11:59.021
Fine.

11:59.877 --> 12:02.073
He's bringing a load
of scrips out next week.

12:02.518 --> 12:04.980
Mexi gangs are making
a big play into the game.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.993
How long has he been in Mexico?

12:08.638 --> 12:10.502
As far as I know, just a couple of days.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.220
Where's your cell phone?

12:20.375 --> 12:21.963
Now leave the keys and get out.

12:22.318 --> 12:23.323
Now get out.

12:24.216 --> 12:25.673
I'll return it with a full tank.

12:27.885 --> 12:29.032
Where have you two been?

12:29.198 --> 12:31.650
Running down that lead
for robbery/homicide, what's going on?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.872
We called your phones.
Why didn't you pick up?

12:34.035 --> 12:36.520
We turned them off.
We didn't want to blow our cover.

12:36.685 --> 12:39.091
The only reason we're here
is we heard the APB out on Vic.

12:39.255 --> 12:40.812
You got a search warrant for his house?

12:41.078 --> 12:42.352
I can't discuss the details.

12:42.548 --> 12:43.932
When was the last time you saw Vic?

12:44.665 --> 12:47.001
Called this morning.
Said he was taking a personal day.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.162
Wagenbach and I
need to speak with you two.

12:49.485 --> 12:50.502
Yeah.

12:50.806 --> 12:52.151
Yeah, let's get this cleared up.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.280
Your official statement
taken the night Lemansky died

12:57.435 --> 13:00.013
says neither you, Vic, or Gardocki

13:00.197 --> 13:01.863
had ever been to the portillo auto body.

13:02.438 --> 13:03.480
Yeah.
That sounds right.

13:03.655 --> 13:04.862
So why did Vic have a map

13:05.456 --> 13:07.351
of the portillo auto body at his house?

13:07.507 --> 13:09.350
Emolia told us that Vic
was gonna give her

13:09.506 --> 13:12.901
$500 to deliver Lem to the salvadorans.

13:13.477 --> 13:15.252
We found that exact amount

13:15.416 --> 13:17.391
in an envelope with Vic's prints on it.

13:17.576 --> 13:18.981
You think Vic set Lem up?

13:20.028 --> 13:21.940
You're crazier than that ex wife of his.

13:23.506 --> 13:27.131
Emolia made numerous calls
to a salvadoran contact

13:27.285 --> 13:28.452
prior to Lemansky's death.

13:28.615 --> 13:30.250
Emolia was outed as a snitch.

13:30.586 --> 13:32.932
She was probably calling
to beg for her life.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.350
- That doesn't prove anything.
- So how do you explain

13:35.516 --> 13:37.843
- all this other evidence here?
- I don't know! Maybe...

13:38.018 --> 13:39.043
maybe Emolia planted it.

13:39.225 --> 13:40.222
Or you did.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.703
That's... That's gold.

13:42.676 --> 13:44.790
Please. Go on.
I really want to hear this one.

13:45.028 --> 13:47.163
Well, you investigated
Vic for six months.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.950
You had every resource the department
had available to you.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.290
You came up
with nothing.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.491
Now, in the few days after Lem dies,

13:53.728 --> 13:56.121
you produce a C.I.
Willing to testify against him

13:56.326 --> 13:57.520
and the evidence to prove it?

13:57.678 --> 13:58.672
Come on, man.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.003
Sounds like you know a lot
about telling tall tales.

14:01.698 --> 14:02.693
Planting evidence.

14:02.856 --> 14:04.161
Practice makes perfect, right?

14:04.727 --> 14:05.893
Vic didn't kill Lem.

14:06.776 --> 14:07.823
He's being set up.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.202
Look, it's no secret things ended ugly
between Vic and Emolia.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.761
Maybe this is just bitch's revenge.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.042
So why'd Vic run?

14:15.225 --> 14:18.943
Why isn't he here defending himself,
answering our questions instead of you?

14:19.127 --> 14:21.341
He probably doesn't even
know you're looking for him.

14:21.505 --> 14:22.560
Dutchboy, come on, man.

14:22.755 --> 14:24.660
Are you really buying this bullshit?

14:24.857 --> 14:25.953
The evidence is right here.

14:26.136 --> 14:27.140
It's right here.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.272
The real question is what
your involvement is.

14:29.605 --> 14:30.622
Vic...

14:30.846 --> 14:31.843
It's too late for him.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.380
If you tell us where he's hiding,

14:33.545 --> 14:34.792
maybe you can save yourself.

14:39.048 --> 14:40.562
- Como estas, Niño.
- Como estas.

14:40.736 --> 14:41.741
Hermano.

14:42.478 --> 14:44.912
An old amigo of mine bunkered down
in San Miguel.

14:45.508 --> 14:46.503
Name's Guardo Lima.

14:46.675 --> 14:48.720
I need you to repatriate him
to the states.

14:49.378 --> 14:50.610
I'm looking for an amigo, too.

14:50.957 --> 14:51.971
Byz lat soldier.

14:52.295 --> 14:53.702
Rumor is he's in east LA

14:57.005 --> 14:58.012
Rocha Garrenzi.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.860
Wanted for three murder
for hires in Mexico city.

15:01.157 --> 15:03.772
Got his address, aliases,
why couldn't you bust him down there?

15:03.928 --> 15:04.963
He was protected.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.141
Married a big shot
cattle rancher's daughter.

15:07.317 --> 15:09.380
Rocha got tired of
milking the same heifer.

15:09.558 --> 15:10.851
Took of with their two niños.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.680
I know about some mexican
drugs coming into town.

15:15.866 --> 15:17.012
I might have some leverage.

15:17.178 --> 15:18.531
If Rocha's arrested in LA,

15:18.706 --> 15:20.913
the case could get caught up
in international courts.

15:21.078 --> 15:22.430
The mother and rich grandparents

15:22.607 --> 15:24.142
are looking for a quicker solution.

15:24.956 --> 15:25.960
They're willing to pay.

15:26.118 --> 15:27.133
I'll cut you in.

15:28.816 --> 15:29.832
What about Rocha?

15:30.075 --> 15:31.553
I don't care what you do with him.

15:31.938 --> 15:33.223
I just need the kids.

15:35.787 --> 15:36.912
I'll meet you back here.

15:37.465 --> 15:38.463
Oh, yeah.

15:38.658 --> 15:39.701
What did this Guardo do?

15:40.176 --> 15:41.172
Why do you want him?

15:41.538 --> 15:42.533
He killed my friend.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.683
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

15:53.837 --> 15:55.810
I tried to reach Shane,
but he wouldn't answer.

15:55.995 --> 15:58.331
Well, he's up in interrogation
with Kavanaugh and Dutch.

15:58.516 --> 15:59.551
What? What's going on?

15:59.716 --> 16:00.721
<i>It's not good.</i>

16:00.898 --> 16:04.343
<i>Asher said they found a map
of Portillo's auto body in your garbage.</i>

16:04.587 --> 16:07.593
<i>Also a matchbook from the shop
Emolia's been working at.</i>

16:07.756 --> 16:09.090
Someone must have put them there.

16:09.247 --> 16:11.822
They're building a case.
You gotta get back here and fight it.

16:11.976 --> 16:14.133
But they can't prove anything.
I didn't do anything.

16:14.286 --> 16:16.040
It's one thing to have
Emolia's statement.

16:16.195 --> 16:17.790
Now they've got corroborating evidence.

16:17.945 --> 16:19.691
<i>Just stay put and keep your ears open.</i>

16:20.185 --> 16:22.032
Call Reyes' gang task force.

16:22.365 --> 16:25.691
You find out which byz lat is the
current king shithead over in east LA

16:25.886 --> 16:27.150
I'll call back in five.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.510
I heard they found evidence on Vic.

16:32.418 --> 16:33.441
Yeah.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.261
Maybe a little too much.

16:36.046 --> 16:37.071
What do you mean?

16:39.745 --> 16:41.271
You ever here of Occam's razor?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.623
The simplest answer is usually
the right one?

16:44.875 --> 16:47.070
Good.
Now apply that to the Lemansky case.

16:47.948 --> 16:50.101
Now all this evidence
is pointing to Vic.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.001
Occam's razor would suggest he's guilty.

16:55.368 --> 16:57.811
Walter Chatton's a contemporary
of Occam's.

16:57.987 --> 16:59.011
Disputed the razor.

16:59.177 --> 17:00.502
Coined his own anti razor.

17:00.927 --> 17:01.932
What's that?

17:02.087 --> 17:04.141
Chatton believed that
the world was too complex.

17:04.305 --> 17:06.550
Too many variables to assume
that the simplest answer

17:06.715 --> 17:07.863
was always the correct one.

17:09.265 --> 17:10.251
OK.

17:11.605 --> 17:13.131
What do you think is going on?

17:23.915 --> 17:26.310
The salvadorans had a
contract out on your life

17:26.496 --> 17:27.741
yet you never left town.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.492
Why not just high-tail it out of here?

17:29.677 --> 17:31.523
I won't talk to anyone but Jon.

17:31.887 --> 17:32.922
Kavanaugh's not here,

17:33.087 --> 17:34.513
and you need to answer my question.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.241
Only reason I'm in this mess
is because of you assholes.

17:42.656 --> 17:43.881
What's this?

17:44.058 --> 17:46.422
I'm exploring another angle.
I'll catch you up later.

17:47.255 --> 17:48.273
Catch me up.

17:48.565 --> 17:49.581
Now.

17:56.436 --> 17:57.880
OK, we know Emolia was greenlit.

17:58.556 --> 18:01.501
What if she was trying to gain favor
with Guardo to save her life?

18:01.726 --> 18:02.772
Cut a deal with him.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.770
They kill Lemansky, she pins it on Vic.

18:06.766 --> 18:09.833
Mackey's out there right now,
and you're wasting time talking to her.

18:10.588 --> 18:12.033
This interrogation, it's over.

18:12.237 --> 18:14.463
Uh, no. It's not.
I'm not finished yet.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.683
We got every cop we have
out looking for Vic.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.363
Look, private tutoring might
buy you favor with your hot unis,

18:21.836 --> 18:24.280
but it doesn't get us any closer
to scooping up Mackey.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.352
If you want to spend your time
exploring pot shot theories than

18:27.558 --> 18:30.522
doing your job like you were supposed
to, we'd have Vic here right now.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.341
And not some innocent witness.

18:32.616 --> 18:33.632
Come on, Emolia.

18:42.826 --> 18:43.833
What's up?

18:47.128 --> 18:48.133
I have some concerns

18:48.356 --> 18:50.461
about keeping Wagenbach
on the Lemansky case.

18:51.055 --> 18:52.542
- Why?
- I know he's your guy,

18:52.747 --> 18:55.703
but we may have a perception problem
should this case ever go to trial.

18:55.906 --> 18:56.913
How?

18:58.376 --> 19:00.073
The defense lawyer could argue...

19:00.736 --> 19:03.501
that Dutch's past relationship
with Corrine has...

19:03.745 --> 19:05.073
strained his objectivity.

19:05.888 --> 19:09.103
Dutch is protecting Vic
for his ex wife's sake?

19:09.977 --> 19:11.582
Their relationship's no secret.

19:12.497 --> 19:14.223
They could argue, that...

19:15.107 --> 19:16.560
he has a personal stake in this.

19:17.058 --> 19:19.720
What about the personal
nature of the case with you?

19:22.628 --> 19:23.640
I'm still an outsider.

19:23.866 --> 19:26.030
IAD is always gonna have
an adversarial relationship

19:26.207 --> 19:27.791
with the people that we investigate.

19:29.748 --> 19:31.211
But the way this case is breaking,

19:32.175 --> 19:34.251
with the evidence that
we have to back it up...

19:35.387 --> 19:36.923
this could be a big win for you.

19:38.158 --> 19:40.531
Finally getting Mackey off the street.

19:48.415 --> 19:50.390
They're building a
murder case against him.

19:51.338 --> 19:52.662
And it might actually stick.

19:53.897 --> 19:55.250
We can't let him take this hit.

20:03.337 --> 20:04.570
And what if, uh...

20:07.425 --> 20:09.610
What if I said that I was with Lem
or something?

20:11.015 --> 20:13.391
You know, had a grenade from the bust.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.571
Just went off by accident.

20:19.637 --> 20:22.002
Making up some bullshit
story is not gonna help.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.983
Plus you'd be admitting
to aiding and abetting.

20:30.298 --> 20:31.423
Yeah.

20:33.306 --> 20:34.342
Yeah, yeah.

20:35.558 --> 20:37.031
We gotta do something for Vic.

20:38.335 --> 20:40.703
The longer he's in the wind,
the guiltier he looks.

20:53.228 --> 20:54.441
Hey, slow your roll, homes.

20:54.936 --> 20:55.961
What's your business?

20:57.318 --> 20:58.341
I'm here to see Santi.

20:59.075 --> 21:01.650
Charley, nobody sees Jefe
without an appointment or a warrant.

21:01.855 --> 21:04.542
I know the local swines,
and I don't recognize your face.

21:04.756 --> 21:05.812
I work Farmington.

21:06.047 --> 21:09.040
Same place your shipment of
mexican scrips is headed to next week.

21:09.626 --> 21:11.310
I don't get to break bread with Santi,

21:11.988 --> 21:14.362
the scrips are gonna end up
in my evidence locker.

21:18.655 --> 21:20.611
Hay un placa de Farmington aqui.

21:22.296 --> 21:23.840
Sabe de los vales que vien.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.162
All right. Let's go.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.032
All right. I need your gun.

21:56.638 --> 21:57.652
It's city issue.

21:58.148 --> 21:59.150
I can't do that.

21:59.347 --> 22:00.611
Well, then you can't see Santi.

22:06.986 --> 22:08.851
There.
No bullets work for you?

22:11.905 --> 22:13.951
Take a hit. Relax,ese.

22:14.205 --> 22:17.162
No, thanks.
I'm good with the contact high.

22:18.727 --> 22:20.213
So what brings you to the east side?

22:20.456 --> 22:23.642
I need a location on a byz lat
still drying the Rio off his back.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.440
Name's Rocha.

22:27.226 --> 22:28.221
So let me guess,

22:28.958 --> 22:31.311
I hand him over,
and my scrips make it into town.

22:32.055 --> 22:33.453
Great minds think alike.

22:34.078 --> 22:35.410
Rocha's valuable to the bosses.

22:35.677 --> 22:37.442
More valuable than your scrips?

22:38.797 --> 22:40.691
You don't want to bust that shipment,
friend.

22:40.897 --> 22:42.623
You're not giving me any other choice.

22:44.388 --> 22:46.973
You bust it, you're declaring war.

22:48.025 --> 22:49.582
Not only on the byz lats,

22:50.147 --> 22:51.783
on all the mexi gangs.

22:57.758 --> 22:59.130
I didn't know there was a peace.

22:59.376 --> 23:01.283
I'm gonna give you some
money for your time.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.260
You forget my face.

23:03.845 --> 23:04.920
And the scrips.

23:05.868 --> 23:07.161
I don't need your money.

23:08.016 --> 23:09.180
I need Rocha.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.061
I'm offering you, an olive branch.

23:16.738 --> 23:18.272
If you prefer shock and awe,

23:18.566 --> 23:20.602
- I can arrange that, too.
- Back off, pendejo.

23:21.757 --> 23:24.312
Lil' homie's shitfaced, ese.

23:25.075 --> 23:27.430
Junior missed the short bus
to school today.

23:29.647 --> 23:31.133
Tell him to lower that weapon.

23:40.497 --> 23:41.970
I ain't afraid of no cops.

23:43.108 --> 23:44.212
I'll do it.

23:48.745 --> 23:50.232
You got no bullets,cerdo.

23:51.407 --> 23:53.063
All that smoke make you forget?

23:53.477 --> 23:55.071
I got one in the chamber, dickhead.

23:56.657 --> 23:58.662
Your honeys were too stoned to notice.

24:00.018 --> 24:01.242
One of you shoots me,

24:01.467 --> 24:03.873
my muscle twitch takes
out your bad boy here.

24:04.348 --> 24:07.791
So, either you and I are gonna leave
this basement together,

24:08.446 --> 24:10.440
or we're gonna leave
this life together.

24:12.135 --> 24:13.192
You decide.

24:30.087 --> 24:31.112
Stay back.

24:33.267 --> 24:34.320
Back off!

24:43.438 --> 24:45.520
You got to the next red to tell me
where Rocha is.

24:46.487 --> 24:48.023
He's putting a hit
on a one-niner.

24:48.517 --> 24:49.533
Jumped my lieutenant.

24:49.718 --> 24:51.233
Which one-niner?
Which one?

24:52.207 --> 24:53.253
Which one?

24:53.585 --> 24:54.681
It's going yellow!

24:55.777 --> 24:57.043
Name's big G.

24:57.305 --> 24:58.820
He deals on 8th and Alameda.

24:59.115 --> 25:01.371
By Colvin High?
When's this going down?

25:01.696 --> 25:02.700
Later today.

25:02.915 --> 25:06.012
Rocha doesn't show up, or you warn him,

25:06.405 --> 25:09.392
and I'm gonna show up with a hell
of a lot more than one in the chamber.

25:09.555 --> 25:10.640
Now get the hell out!

25:10.866 --> 25:12.691
Well, shit, man.
At least slow down,ese.

25:12.897 --> 25:14.450
- Get out!
- Slow down, man!

25:29.677 --> 25:30.710
Big G.

25:32.947 --> 25:34.720
Man, check y'all Niggaz later,
all right?

25:35.525 --> 25:37.193
- Yeah, so?
- Your lucky day.

25:37.595 --> 25:40.200
Someone's planning on killing you,
and I actually give a shit.

25:40.427 --> 25:42.182
Well, I guess I best
be going then, right?

25:42.375 --> 25:43.443
You aren't going anywhere.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.831
If the killer can't find you,

25:45.006 --> 25:47.630
then they can't kill you.
And that's gonna be a problem for me.

25:51.568 --> 25:54.900
What if this vato does a drive-by & gets
some shots off before y'all get to him?

25:55.107 --> 25:57.190
This guy's a pro.
He's gonna step right up to you,

25:57.345 --> 25:59.142
put two in your chest
and one in your head.

25:59.338 --> 26:00.930
That's supposed to make me feel better?

26:01.116 --> 26:02.441
Get back to your spot!

26:05.955 --> 26:08.553
- Thanks for coming in.
- Two unmarked police sedans have been

26:08.746 --> 26:11.980
parked outside my house all day long.
I was a cop's wife long enough to know

26:12.138 --> 26:14.140
- that there's trouble.
- When was the last time

26:14.295 --> 26:16.501
- you saw or spoke to Vic?
- Last night.

26:16.927 --> 26:19.373
He said that someone was trying
to pin Lem's murder on him.

26:19.556 --> 26:21.892
A warrant was filed for his arrest
this morning.

26:22.775 --> 26:24.653
For what?
For Lem's murder?

26:24.868 --> 26:28.061
- He would never in a million years.
- The evidence is pointing in that mean.

26:28.228 --> 26:29.372
What evidence?

26:29.636 --> 26:32.393
Oh, my God. You don't believe this,
do you? I mean, there's no way

26:32.576 --> 26:35.503
- that he would ever do anything
- Kavanaugh has generated some proof.

26:35.977 --> 26:40.111
Listen, you need to prepare yourself
for this to go either way.

26:40.568 --> 26:42.943
You need to start preparing the kids.
OK?

26:47.485 --> 26:49.953
- Corrine, wait.
- What are you doing to my husband, huh?

26:50.156 --> 26:51.872
- Your ex husband.
- I know you hate Vic,

26:52.056 --> 26:54.422
but that doesn't give you the
right to destroy my family.

26:54.588 --> 26:57.573
Vic had Lemansky killed because he was
a threat. The evidence proves it.

26:57.756 --> 27:00.060
I don't believe you.
I don't believe any of this!

27:01.117 --> 27:03.130
Let's go somewhere else,
we can talk in private.

27:03.315 --> 27:05.480
Get off of me.
Where do you want to go, to my house?

27:05.645 --> 27:08.810
You want to put your hands all over
me again? Lean me up against the door?

27:08.996 --> 27:10.900
Try to screw me to get back at Vic?

27:11.155 --> 27:13.713
In some demented, twisted way?

27:14.406 --> 27:15.551
I only asked you questions.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.541
Yeah, right. You used your badge

27:17.726 --> 27:18.982
to get into my house,

27:19.395 --> 27:21.010
and then you tried to touch me.

27:21.577 --> 27:22.862
I didn't feel safe.

27:23.485 --> 27:24.911
- Corrine...
- No, listen to me.

27:25.175 --> 27:26.201
He...

27:26.467 --> 27:29.143
He entered my house
under false pretenses.

27:29.365 --> 27:31.743
And then he tried
to sexually assault me.

27:32.016 --> 27:33.291
I want to file charges.

27:34.205 --> 27:36.450
- Are you sure about this?
- Either take my statement,

27:36.655 --> 27:38.431
or I'm gonna file charges
somewhere else.

27:52.985 --> 27:54.141
Just stay there.

28:05.357 --> 28:06.372
Drop it!

28:08.987 --> 28:10.771
All right.
Where are you keeping your kids?

28:10.975 --> 28:12.163
Who the hell are you?

28:12.356 --> 28:13.502
Your father-in-law hired me.

28:13.717 --> 28:14.910
All he wants are the kids.

28:15.115 --> 28:17.401
If you tell me where they're at,
then I'll let you go.

28:18.725 --> 28:20.760
The cavalry's gonna show up any minute.

28:21.178 --> 28:22.392
The Moreland motel.

28:23.417 --> 28:24.473
Room 8.

28:24.905 --> 28:25.931
All right. Good.

28:29.065 --> 28:30.490
What about letting me go, man?

28:30.715 --> 28:32.560
Yeah. I feel like shit about that.

28:34.488 --> 28:35.542
How's Corrine?

28:35.825 --> 28:37.041
She's filing charges.

28:37.676 --> 28:38.762
Sticking to her guns.

28:39.016 --> 28:40.320
Attempted sexual ag.

28:40.707 --> 28:42.701
- You believe her?
- I believe she believes it.

28:42.886 --> 28:45.750
I wouldn't have thought Kavanaugh
was capable of something like that.

28:45.938 --> 28:48.073
Makes you wonder
what else he's capable of.

28:50.605 --> 28:53.931
Yesterday, you insinuated Emolia
might have been lying.

28:54.116 --> 28:55.203
Setting Vic up.

28:55.386 --> 28:56.961
Today, not a peep. Why?

29:01.505 --> 29:04.060
Maybe considering everything
we suspect Vic's done,

29:04.316 --> 29:06.473
you see him going down
for this as some sort of...

29:06.935 --> 29:08.810
karmic justice whether he did it or not.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.263
I know he's a bad guy.

29:11.265 --> 29:12.753
The evidence is the evidence.

29:13.557 --> 29:15.533
It's tempting to let sleeping dogs lie.

29:16.295 --> 29:18.271
Especially
when the dog's as rabid as Vic.

29:18.728 --> 29:22.681
But I've got one chance
to right this ship, Dutch.

29:23.046 --> 29:24.933
To do it,
I have to put an end to a pattern

29:25.146 --> 29:27.860
of silent deals and moral exchanges

29:28.065 --> 29:30.493
that have steered this place off course.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.322
That means to pursue the truth.

29:33.635 --> 29:34.992
And the truth only.

29:43.195 --> 29:45.471
Yesterday, I thought Emolia
was lying to me.

29:46.918 --> 29:47.952
I still do.

29:48.716 --> 29:51.131
I can't prove it,
but I'm starting to think that Kavanaugh

29:51.327 --> 29:52.653
is the one that fed her the lie.

29:52.896 --> 29:54.882
It's one thing believing Vic's innocent,

29:55.546 --> 29:57.990
but to accuse Kavanaugh,
of setting Vic up,

29:58.156 --> 30:01.150
- that's a whole other can of worms.
- He's already lied to me once.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.700
He said he met Emolia yesterday
at Sid's coffee.

30:03.977 --> 30:05.730
I pulled footage
from the 101 freeway cam.

30:05.956 --> 30:07.040
Sid's is clear.

30:07.497 --> 30:09.343
No Kavanaugh. No Emolia.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.213
The truth... May not always
lead us down the path we want.

30:20.176 --> 30:22.440
But it's the only way to fix this place.

30:22.626 --> 30:24.753
Get Emolia and bring her back down here.

30:42.137 --> 30:44.493
- You brought their mother?
- She insisted on coming.

30:46.618 --> 30:47.662
Where's Guardo?

30:48.536 --> 30:50.191
I'm really sorry. I couldn't get to him.

30:50.376 --> 30:51.382
That's bullshit!

30:51.558 --> 30:54.451
- You didn't tell me how connected he's.
- I couldn't get close enough

30:54.628 --> 30:58.010
- to talk to him let alone shanghal him.
- I don't giva shit how connected he is!

30:58.196 --> 31:00.491
I kept my part of the deal.
I expect you to keep yours.

31:00.658 --> 31:02.611
He's got too many people on his payroll.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.570
- It's impossible. I'm sorry.
- Maybe he's got you on his payroll.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.843
Look, I'll make it up to you, huh?
These people are paying me well

31:09.028 --> 31:10.091
for delivering these kids.

31:10.276 --> 31:12.032
I'll increase your cut.
Plus...

31:12.597 --> 31:15.122
- Ask any other favor.
- I don't want your goddamn money.

31:15.386 --> 31:16.452
I want Guardo!

31:17.416 --> 31:19.373
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

31:22.715 --> 31:23.800
Goddamnit!

31:30.607 --> 31:31.623
All right.

31:32.556 --> 31:34.830
Can you get close enough to
him to give him a message?

31:35.156 --> 31:36.262
I might be able to do that.

31:36.425 --> 31:37.992
Then you meet me here in 2 hours.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.603
It's nonsense.

31:44.887 --> 31:45.940
I'll call you back.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.351
Uh, Captain.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.203
- Why's Emolia here?
- I need to ask her some questions.

31:52.585 --> 31:53.603
Great.

31:53.765 --> 31:56.593
- I'll come with you.
- Uh, I prefer some alone time with her.

31:57.156 --> 31:59.291
But you can't question her
without me being there.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.182
The last time I checked,
I was captain of this house not you.

32:03.456 --> 32:06.612
You want to watch, there's a front row
seat for you in the observation room.

32:06.817 --> 32:07.832
It's part of her deal.

32:08.506 --> 32:10.493
She's been burned
by the people here before.

32:10.835 --> 32:11.851
And...

32:12.066 --> 32:13.781
I promised I wouldn't leave her alone.

32:17.126 --> 32:18.190
Fine.

32:18.417 --> 32:19.812
But you just listen.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.691
Emolia, I'm the one who said
those things about Sebastio.

32:24.888 --> 32:25.892
It wasn't Vic.

32:26.137 --> 32:28.160
He always took care
of you two, you know that.

32:28.386 --> 32:30.871
Come on. Emolia, please.
Don't do this to him.

32:31.467 --> 32:32.592
Emolia.

32:44.487 --> 32:45.550
<i>I love this room.</i>

32:45.776 --> 32:47.022
<i>It's my favorite one here.</i>

32:47.756 --> 32:48.771
<i>It's kind of ugly.</i>

32:49.556 --> 32:50.561
Cold.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.210
It's not much to look at.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.420
But it brings the truth out in people.

32:58.117 --> 33:00.810
I fixed a lot of wrongs
inside these walls.

33:01.795 --> 33:03.680
That's what we do in here, Emolia.

33:04.267 --> 33:05.303
Find the truth.

33:05.598 --> 33:07.191
I already told you the truth.

33:07.405 --> 33:10.231
That bullshit story you've been spinning
about Vic? I don't buy it.

33:10.458 --> 33:11.560
That's your problem then.

33:11.785 --> 33:15.430
Guardo wanted to have you killed,
you made up a story about Vic

33:15.657 --> 33:17.412
so that you could
get witness protection.

33:17.618 --> 33:19.462
Now does that sound about right?

33:23.646 --> 33:25.243
You can answer her.
It's all right.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.853
Vic wanted Lem dead.

33:29.095 --> 33:31.742
Gave me his location to give to Guardo.
That's it.

33:37.166 --> 33:39.693
Officer Lowe, Officer Asher, I need you.

33:41.617 --> 33:42.752
I want you out this room.

33:43.106 --> 33:44.111
That's not gonna happen.

33:44.308 --> 33:47.113
- The assistant chief himself...
- I don't care what deal you made.

33:47.337 --> 33:49.010
Either you leave this room on your own,

33:49.176 --> 33:51.310
or I'll have these two
officers do it for you.

33:57.897 --> 33:58.911
You all right?

33:59.235 --> 34:00.251
Yeah.

34:11.856 --> 34:13.023
<i>I've red your jacket.</i>

34:14.118 --> 34:15.723
You've been in a lot of trouble,

34:15.928 --> 34:18.632
but nothing like this pissing match
between Vic and Kavanaugh.

34:19.967 --> 34:21.681
I'm getting witness protection.

34:21.938 --> 34:23.301
Starting a new life.

34:23.635 --> 34:25.940
- I'm doing OK.
- You're not doing OK.

34:26.505 --> 34:27.542
You're trapped.

34:27.746 --> 34:28.752
You're scared.

34:29.918 --> 34:31.170
You're living in fear.

34:33.077 --> 34:35.072
You're ping-ponging
between these two men

34:35.286 --> 34:37.891
who have done nothing
but use and abuse you,

34:38.098 --> 34:40.360
<i>and I'd have more sympathy for you</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:43.552
<i>except you let them do it for a buck.</i>

34:43.876 --> 34:44.982
<i>For my son.</i>

34:45.225 --> 34:46.233
<i>Your son?</i>

34:46.605 --> 34:49.172
What are you gonna tell your son
about this time of your life?

34:50.107 --> 34:53.460
That you let Vic and Kavanaugh
steal away your soul?

34:55.045 --> 34:58.901
<i>Or that you were lost and found
the strength to free yourself?</i>

35:00.058 --> 35:01.383
I know you're scared.

35:01.637 --> 35:02.762
I'd be, too.

35:04.946 --> 35:06.881
But I can offer you...

35:07.536 --> 35:09.530
a way out...
if you let me.

35:12.505 --> 35:14.641
- How?
- First you have to tell me the truth.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.961
<i>You've helped this
department out before...</i>

35:18.787 --> 35:20.720
<i>and I can see about
arranging protection.</i>

35:21.617 --> 35:23.182
<i>I'm offering you...</i>

35:23.557 --> 35:24.581
<i>a way...</i>

35:25.336 --> 35:27.453
<i>to be rid of these men forever.</i>

35:27.636 --> 35:28.641
<i>Take it.</i>

35:28.866 --> 35:32.192
Because they're leading you down
a path that is destroying you...

35:32.438 --> 35:33.791
your son...

35:35.556 --> 35:37.133
and everything around you.

35:38.408 --> 35:39.472
You know it.

35:42.708 --> 35:43.721
<i>Everything...</i>

35:44.305 --> 35:45.372
<i>is gonna be all right.</i>

35:46.686 --> 35:48.093
<i>You're gonna be ok. I promise.</i>

35:50.597 --> 35:51.611
I need to, uh...

35:52.997 --> 35:54.493
I need to talk to Captain Wyms.

35:59.327 --> 36:00.330
I have to talk...

36:00.555 --> 36:02.441
- Please.
- It's ok. It's ok.

36:13.075 --> 36:15.010
But first you got to tell me the truth.

36:24.376 --> 36:25.581
I fed her the story.

36:28.387 --> 36:29.593
Coerced her statement.

36:30.238 --> 36:32.123
Planted the evidence in Mackey's house.

36:34.157 --> 36:36.221
But I framed a guilty man.

36:52.675 --> 36:55.342
- You guys make sure you weren't tailed?
- Yeah. Where's Guardo?

36:55.505 --> 36:56.523
Tonio boned me.

36:56.767 --> 36:58.973
- Couldn't bag the whale.
- Well, what do we do now?

36:59.998 --> 37:01.912
Switch bait.
Nydia home?

37:02.135 --> 37:03.142
Yeah.

37:03.457 --> 37:05.502
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.613
- What's the plan?
- Just follow my lead.

37:20.557 --> 37:22.280
- Nydia Hernandez?
- Yes.

37:22.506 --> 37:23.552
Detective Mackey.

37:24.097 --> 37:25.973
This is Detectives
Vendrell and Gardocki.

37:26.357 --> 37:27.372
What's going on?

37:27.537 --> 37:30.132
We have information that someone's
planning on kidnapping you.

37:30.295 --> 37:32.181
- What?
- Our department's been investigating

37:32.348 --> 37:33.812
a mexican drug lord named Salceda.

37:34.367 --> 37:37.043
An informant of ours...
Told us that he's...

37:39.528 --> 37:42.000
And we heard he's planning to kill
your boyfriend Guardo.

37:42.315 --> 37:44.132
To take over his drug
protection business.

37:44.957 --> 37:46.221
I don't know any Guardo.

37:48.017 --> 37:49.680
- You're not his girlfriend?
- No.

37:50.015 --> 37:51.060
Never heard of the guy.

37:52.065 --> 37:54.803
Wow.
Then maybe we're looking for another...

37:55.187 --> 37:56.762
Nydia Hernandez.

37:58.128 --> 37:59.473
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you

37:59.678 --> 38:00.912
if you're not his girlfriend,

38:01.318 --> 38:02.652
you got nothing to worry about.

38:06.815 --> 38:07.822
Wait.

38:11.307 --> 38:13.580
Guardo told me never to talk to cops.

38:14.338 --> 38:16.201
Why would someone want to kidnap me?

38:16.457 --> 38:18.032
It's Guardo Salceda wants.

38:18.945 --> 38:20.192
But he's in Mexico.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.343
Our C.I. has learned that he plans on

38:22.545 --> 38:24.503
kidnapping you to use you as bait

38:24.787 --> 38:26.540
to lure Guardo back to LA.

38:26.797 --> 38:29.083
We were worried
we weren't going to get to you in time.

38:29.358 --> 38:32.372
We need to get you into a safehouse
while we hunt down Salceda.

38:34.036 --> 38:35.622
Well, I should call Guardo. Warn him.

38:35.776 --> 38:38.181
No, we don't know who's listening
on his side of the line.

38:38.378 --> 38:40.112
Our intel says it's an inside job.

38:41.097 --> 38:42.250
We have to move you now.

38:43.295 --> 38:46.283
- How long is this gonna take?
- A day. Two at the most.

38:46.507 --> 38:49.582
Ronnie will take you to the safehouse
immediately. We'll pack some clothes

38:49.768 --> 38:52.632
- for you. Meet you there, all right?
- Come on. We better get going.

38:56.665 --> 38:57.841
What the hell are you doing?

38:58.028 --> 38:59.261
What the hell are you doing?

38:59.685 --> 39:00.753
Vic?

39:03.587 --> 39:04.601
Just pack.

39:05.055 --> 39:06.081
I'll explain later.

39:25.285 --> 39:26.772
I never cheated on anything before.

39:28.426 --> 39:29.860
The first time I do, I get caught

39:30.697 --> 39:33.702
taking the dirtiest man
I ever met off the street.

39:34.195 --> 39:36.172
You set another cop up for murder.

39:36.647 --> 39:39.040
Threw away your career.
I fail to see the humor.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.281
I guess I didn't have enough practice

39:43.598 --> 39:45.690
planting evidence,
manipulating witnesses and...

39:45.876 --> 39:48.252
- covering my tracks.
- You sacrificed your integrity

39:48.418 --> 39:49.583
for Vic Mackey.

39:50.636 --> 39:53.550
You are better than that.
You used to be better than him.

39:53.836 --> 39:54.860
I still am.

39:58.297 --> 39:59.712
Take his gun and badge.

40:09.735 --> 40:12.032
You're under arrest for interfering in
police business

40:12.256 --> 40:13.651
under color of authority.

40:14.838 --> 40:16.990
I assume other charges will follow.

40:18.497 --> 40:19.511
Put him in the cage?

40:19.748 --> 40:21.583
No. Take him straight to police one.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.231
Cuff him in front. Keep it quiet.

40:32.507 --> 40:34.441
At least I have Mackey out of my life.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.331
He's not my problem anymore.

40:38.278 --> 40:39.293
He's yours.

41:16.215 --> 41:17.231
What's this?

41:17.868 --> 41:20.080
It's the message I want you
to deliver to Guardo.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.061
A necklace?

41:22.835 --> 41:24.393
Deliver it to him in person.

41:24.706 --> 41:26.720
You tell him that
Nydia's been kidnapped.

41:27.308 --> 41:28.911
If he ever wants to see her again,

41:29.627 --> 41:32.553
he has 24 hours to get 50 grand in cash,

41:32.846 --> 41:34.513
in person to LA.

41:38.028 --> 41:39.580
I don't think I want any part of this.

41:39.857 --> 41:41.983
Let alone what you do to
him after you've got him.

41:42.158 --> 41:44.862
- Vic, come on. Think about this.
- You're delivering a message.

41:45.126 --> 41:46.551
Your involvement ends there.

41:46.935 --> 41:49.523
And I'll forgo my cut
for the returned kids.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.252
OK.

41:56.827 --> 42:00.041
You tell Guardo, call Nydia's cell phone
when he wants to set the meet.

42:03.528 --> 42:04.983
Hey, hey. A ransom?

42:05.207 --> 42:07.020
The last thing we need
is more dirty money.

42:07.256 --> 42:08.892
I don't give a shit about the 50 grand.

42:09.347 --> 42:11.390
Once Guardo finds out
Nydia's been kidnapped,

42:11.596 --> 42:12.923
he'll have to come to LA.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.663
Word gets out he can't protect
his own girlfriend,

42:15.896 --> 42:18.333
who's gonna trust him
to protect their drugs?

42:20.205 --> 42:21.453
Vic, don't do this.

42:21.887 --> 42:22.903
Please.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.430
Lem's gone.

42:25.088 --> 42:26.910
Nothing we can do can bring him back.

42:29.478 --> 42:32.043
You push this too fare, man
we're gonna lose you, too.

42:36.675 --> 42:38.013
Guardo has to pay.

42:54.127 --> 42:55.990
- Where's Nydia?
- The bedroom sleeping.

42:56.276 --> 42:57.740
This just turned into a kidnapping.

42:58.148 --> 42:59.160
What do you mean?

42:59.386 --> 43:00.580
Vic sent a message to Guardo.

43:00.777 --> 43:03.203
If he doesn't meet us in 24 hours,
she dies.

43:03.937 --> 43:05.292
What do we do if he doesn't show?

43:05.495 --> 43:06.533
Oh, he'll show.

43:06.956 --> 43:07.960
This her cell phone?

43:08.186 --> 43:09.273
Yeah. If he does show,

43:09.478 --> 43:12.190
- What do we do with her?
- I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

43:12.376 --> 43:13.390
Vic, this is wrong.

43:14.215 --> 43:16.843
You two don't have to be involved
in this. Go back to the barn.

43:17.047 --> 43:18.250
Keep your distance from me.

43:26.688 --> 43:27.693
Good job.

43:28.868 --> 43:29.893
How's he doing?

43:30.535 --> 43:32.000
He's beautiful.
I'll see you.

43:32.195 --> 43:33.210
How are you?

43:33.437 --> 43:34.452
I'm exhausted.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.260
He's been colicky.
Keeping me up all night.

43:37.695 --> 43:40.560
Well, I do have some good news
I wanted to tell you face to face.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.590
Any excuse to get out of the house.
I need some adult time.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.190
You passed the sergeant's exam.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.133
- Congratulations.
- Oh, God.

43:49.785 --> 43:50.870
Bless you.

43:51.998 --> 43:54.951
So I start wearing these as soon as
my maternity leave is over, huh?

43:55.196 --> 43:58.780
The slot's available
effective immediately.

43:59.078 --> 44:02.073
If you don't take it, your name
goes back to the bottom of the list.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.621
You mean I have to
come back to work right away?

44:05.917 --> 44:08.251
Or you pick another slot if it opens up.

44:08.675 --> 44:10.543
That's what happens
when men make the rules.

44:10.726 --> 44:12.723
You sleep on it,
let me know in the morning.

44:12.945 --> 44:15.213
Hey, either of you two
seen or heard from Vic?

44:15.948 --> 44:17.943
- No.
- If you do, tell him he can go home.

44:20.827 --> 44:21.840
Why is that?

44:22.537 --> 44:24.622
Because the case against
him has been dropped.

44:24.926 --> 44:27.100
So, if he is still in the country,

44:27.525 --> 44:29.482
tell him he can sleep
in his own bed tonight.

44:32.576 --> 44:34.912
You're clear.
You can go back to work.

44:35.877 --> 44:37.233
Just let Nydia go.

44:40.087 --> 44:41.221
We got a reprieve.

44:41.556 --> 44:45.010
Dutchboy and Claudette saved our asses.
Just wake her up and get her out'f here.

44:45.217 --> 44:46.933
She's how we're going to get to Guardo.

44:47.426 --> 44:49.720
What happened to no more
unilateral decisions.

44:50.106 --> 44:51.182
Shane's right.

44:51.975 --> 44:53.553
I want this guy just as bad as you,

44:53.776 --> 44:58.601
- but not like this. This is too risky.
- Every second he gets to breathe

44:58.846 --> 45:01.370
and Lem doesn't is unacceptable.

45:08.076 --> 45:09.360
I'll do it myself.

45:09.725 --> 45:10.960
What is your problem?

45:11.548 --> 45:13.741
Can you listen to anybody but yourself?

45:14.405 --> 45:17.181
Lem wouldn't listen about going
to Mexico. He's dead because of it.

45:17.405 --> 45:18.892
Is that what you want, man, huh?

45:19.138 --> 45:20.151
You want to die?

45:20.518 --> 45:22.612
You want to go to jail?
You want us to go to jail?

45:36.895 --> 45:38.940
Go home. Get some shut eye.

45:41.025 --> 45:42.462
I'll guard the fort for the night.

45:53.498 --> 45:54.690
I'll just be a minute.

46:01.087 --> 46:02.480
You've been a very busy boy.

46:02.956 --> 46:04.103
Planting evidence.

46:04.508 --> 46:05.750
Coercing witnesses.

46:06.645 --> 46:08.020
Assaulting my ex wife.

46:08.847 --> 46:10.040
I learned from the master.

46:13.727 --> 46:16.022
I told you you weren't ready
to play at this level.

46:17.736 --> 46:19.361
Wouldn't have mattered even if I was.

46:20.437 --> 46:21.452
The truth is...

46:22.195 --> 46:23.213
isn't your time yet.

46:24.715 --> 46:25.731
But it'll happen.

46:26.747 --> 46:29.013
The universe will take out
its trash when it's ready.

46:29.397 --> 46:31.212
Looks like it already has.

46:33.607 --> 46:35.091
You corrupted everything around you.

46:36.367 --> 46:39.380
Turned a good man like Lemansky
into a thug and a thief.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.381
And you got him killed for it.

46:43.015 --> 46:44.743
I tried to become you for a minute.

46:45.087 --> 46:46.121
But...

46:46.668 --> 46:47.660
it wasn't worth it.

46:49.085 --> 46:50.101
I'll take my lumps.

46:50.325 --> 46:51.330
Go back to my life.

46:52.785 --> 46:53.821
But I won't be the one

46:54.028 --> 46:56.072
hearing my dead friend's
screams in my head.

46:59.218 --> 47:01.630
You preach
all the existential bullshit you want.

47:02.705 --> 47:04.641
But I'm the one going home to my bed

47:05.335 --> 47:06.570
while you're still here.

47:08.337 --> 47:09.373
I'm at peace.

47:11.428 --> 47:12.440
Are you?

47:14.248 --> 47:15.250
Soon enough.
