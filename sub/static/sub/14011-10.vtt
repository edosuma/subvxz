00:09.343 --> 00:11.176

00:11.178 --> 00:13.412

00:19.453 --> 00:23.288
MAN:
<i> I get home at midnight.</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:25.457
She wants to jump my bones.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.493
I want to sleep.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.494
She says
I don't pay enough attention.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.329
I don't love her.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.097
Listen, Ubi, give her a kiss,
tell her she's the best thing

00:32.099 --> 00:34.466
that ever happened to you
in your life.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.035
All right?
That will shut her up.

00:36.037 --> 00:39.071

00:46.580 --> 00:48.313
Check this out.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.617

00:55.156 --> 00:58.223
Go! It lets out
on Spring Street.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.251
PARTNER:
Hey.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.686
Huh?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.428
(<i> gasps</i> )

01:36.430 --> 01:38.130
Damn.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.139
Who would want

01:47.141 --> 01:49.475
to steal this stuff?

01:49.477 --> 01:51.643
Who would want to make it?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.585
Hey, Pooly.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.188
This one's real.

GREEVEY:
I.D.?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.477
Lease says Victor More.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.479
Pays three grand
a month.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.781
Premises rented
for work only.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.217
Some work.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.652
If I did stuff like this,
I wouldn't advertise either.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.554
Look at her eyes.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.690
They look
like marbles, huh?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.425
She ain't half bad.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.694
I'd take her out
for coffee.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.597
He makes them,
dresses them up kinky

03:51.599 --> 03:53.398
and then photographs them.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.766
Yo, Pooly, these
two guys in leather--

03:54.768 --> 03:57.736
you know,
Batman and Robin?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.538
You sure they
came out of here?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.906
Well, when they
saw us, they ran.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.841
Camera was in the lot.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.943
Print on
the steps.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.678
Whoa.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.682
This looks like the camera
was snapping while he died.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.918
Oh, someone wanted
a souvenir.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.653
Oh, that's sick.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.756
You know what the
Bible says, Max.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.559
"As you sow,
so shall you reap."

04:20.561 --> 04:23.562
Nobody deserves to die.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.566
WOMAN:
He hasn't lived here<i> for months</i>

04:27.568 --> 04:29.935
Just what exactly
are you looking for?

04:29.937 --> 04:33.772
Ma'am, we're just trying
to find out what happened.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.876
What happened is that somebody
killed my husband.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.778
Softball?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.747
The Soho Artists League.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.516
Victor's a baseball fanatic.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.485
Me, too.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.521
Victor always said
there were three ways

04:49.523 --> 04:52.524
you could tell
what somebody was like.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.760
How they ran
the bases,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.895
the books
they read,

04:56.897 --> 04:59.431
things they saved.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.799
Frank's Diner?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.868
Mm. Around the corner.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.505
Victor liked to sketch there.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.040
Elaine's.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.942
My agent took us.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.645
The Iron Bar?

05:13.647 --> 05:16.081
The Iron Bar?

05:20.454 --> 05:23.722
The man with
the baseball cap...

05:23.724 --> 05:27.693
he's been in here
a couple of times.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.628
And last night?

05:30.698 --> 05:32.564
It's crowded.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.965
I just serve them.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.901
Well, you know

05:35.903 --> 05:37.736
maybe I'll walk
around the block

05:37.738 --> 05:39.071
and maybe your memory
will get better...

05:41.975 --> 05:43.709
...or I'll get angrier.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.711
All right, all right, all right.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.712
He was here, all right,
hanging on some weird blonde.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.216
Weird what? Bleached, what?

05:50.217 --> 05:52.718
Weird like Marilyn Monroe
back from the dead, but 6'2"

05:52.720 --> 05:54.720
with these blue-green stripes

05:54.722 --> 05:56.722
in her hair.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.591
And where might we find
this lady?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.693
She works in a leather shop.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.695
The Erogenous Zone.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.598
In belts,
you want only alligator.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.734
In harnesses,
saddle leather.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.803
Like a good briefcase
or a nightstick?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.739
You hang out
at the Iron Bar?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.807
Those rough types
aren't for me.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.909
My milieu-- a place
called Best Friends,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.811
in the West Village.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.948
Gay preppies-- the ones
with Dartmouth and Yale

06:22.950 --> 06:24.816
on their T-shirts.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.752
You were at the
Iron Bar last night.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.886
I wanted a club soda,
it was close.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.722
500 bucks?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.692
Newborn calf.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.660
Vat-tanned.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.563
We're the only store in New York
that carries it.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.933
Who buys this stuff?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.102
That leather has no grain.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.171
It's like wearing skin.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.607
Reminds you the animal
was once alive,

06:48.609 --> 06:49.841
if you like that sort of thing.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.543
Did you leave

06:51.545 --> 06:53.078
with Victor
last night?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.613
I didn't know
the man from Adam.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.714
He wasn't looking
for me anyway,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.182
he wanted Brian.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.185
Who used to belong to me.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.953
My father is going
to have a stroke

07:01.955 --> 07:04.756
if my picture's in the paper.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.924
All right, Brian,
come here.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.925
Come on, get out here.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.027
Sit down.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.663
Just tell us
what happened.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.766
I was wearing a leather jacket
he liked,

07:14.768 --> 07:19.137
and he asked me if I wanted
to be in a performance art work.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.139
Okay? So I was tempted.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.875
Your father
would have loved that.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.744
You get a little
adrenalin going.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.646
You know, like you.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.014
When you chase some guy
down a dark alley,

07:29.016 --> 07:32.651
and maybe he's got a knife,
maybe he's got a gun,

07:32.653 --> 07:34.052
and you never know
what's going to happen.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.621
You and me, we're a lot alike.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.156
You didn't leave
with Victor then?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.158
There was something...

07:40.160 --> 07:42.894
something about him
I didn't trust.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.729
Let me get this straight.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.032
You're asked out
on a date by a guy

07:47.034 --> 07:49.167
who publishes
pictures of people

07:49.169 --> 07:50.836
hanging upside
down in chains,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.170
and you're tempted,

07:52.172 --> 07:55.707
but there's something
about him you don't trust?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.042
Yeah.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.979
LOGAN:
He died of...?

08:00.981 --> 08:04.115
Asphyxiation during a state
of sexual arousal.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.985
You ever hear
of anything so damn stupid?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.988
Something must have
gone wrong.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.156
Yeah. He died.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.891
So you're saying

08:12.893 --> 08:15.093
he hung himself voluntarily?

08:15.095 --> 08:20.732
This gentleman played
some pretty dangerous sports

08:20.734 --> 08:22.734
in his day.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.737
Burn scars, cuts,
healed fractures.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.807
What's the official
cause of death?

08:28.809 --> 08:31.243
You can rule out natural causes.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.211
<i> "Artist hangs.</i>

08:33.213 --> 08:34.279
Not a pretty picture."

08:34.281 --> 08:35.881
Great, this is great.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.949
"Dirty pictures--
death imitates art."

08:37.951 --> 08:40.018
Fine and this is
only the first day.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.286
Captain, what do you
want us to do about it?

08:41.288 --> 08:42.921
The press gets ahold...
The case is boiling,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.756
I'd like to turn
the heat down.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.758
Look, it sells as a suicide.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.793
Fine. Sold. Wrap it up.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.228
Damn it, what?
What is it?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.897
The Polaroid.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.665
Somebody else was there.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.233
Even if they
didn't hang him,

08:55.234 --> 08:56.800
it's still a crime to
facilitate a suicide.

08:56.803 --> 09:00.739
Okay, go back to the wife
and see if Victor came home

09:00.741 --> 09:03.808
a little banged up
with no explanation.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.810
LOGAN:
She doesn't have a clue.

09:05.812 --> 09:06.878
The guy's Jekyll and Hyde.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.079
She married Jekyll.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.015
Well, take her
through it again, Mike.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.951
People always know things they
don't think they know, you know?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.720
Give me a minute, huh?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.164
What is it?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.033
Take me off this one.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.701
Come on, Max,
you know I can't...

09:29.703 --> 09:30.902
I'm burned out.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.871
This thing disgusts me.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.423
This guy's pictures-- porn.

09:34.424 --> 09:35.974
If that's art,
Hugh Hefner's Michelangelo.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.943
Max, a man is dead here.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.811
You're the one saying
it's not a suicide.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.146
What do you want me to do, lie?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.747
There was somebody else there.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.182
Chances are, living that life,

09:44.184 --> 09:46.918
he'll be dead
in a couple of years anyway.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.287
As far as I'm concerned,
he's going to the same place.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.823
What-what-what
are you talking about?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.725
I'm a Catholic.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.827
Maybe it's old fashioned,
but I still believe in sin.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.062
Remember sin? Right and wrong?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.931
I don't know if it's harps
or pearly gates

09:59.933 --> 10:04.169
but whatever it is, these freaks
aren't going to the same place

10:04.171 --> 10:06.171
you and I are, okay?

10:06.173 --> 10:08.340
Wow.

10:08.342 --> 10:11.776
I can see this leading to
a whole new penalogical outlook.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.345
We will only pursue homicides

10:13.347 --> 10:15.880
where the vic died
in a state of grace.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.849
I'm not kidding about this.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.950
Neither am I.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.852
After 26 years in,
I got to tell you

10:20.854 --> 10:22.988
it is not about the people
involved in the crime

10:22.990 --> 10:25.140
it's about the crime?

10:25.141 --> 10:27.291
Yesterday we walk into this
leather bar, high noon.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.894
The place still reeks
of stale sex.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.296
We're not talking about

10:31.298 --> 10:33.131
beautiful people here.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.799
Request denied.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.003
If somebody else was there,
then you find him

10:38.005 --> 10:40.005
and you charge him.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.941
I would start with the wife.

10:49.883 --> 10:55.253
GREEVEY:
Did he ever come home hurt?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.956
I'm on the road a lot.

11:00.027 --> 11:04.429
Just in the last year,
things changed.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.365
He was mugged.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.836
Last August.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.408
Last April.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.081
Last November.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.351
He was mugged a lot.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.854
Married 15 years

11:29.856 --> 11:32.957
and she thinks he was
just taking pictures?

11:32.959 --> 11:34.359
Come on.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.429
Could you keep secrets
like that from your wife?

11:37.431 --> 11:39.397
Don't kid yourself.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.466
Everybody's got secrets.

11:41.468 --> 11:45.103
On the weekends,
he picked me up.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.339
Sometimes, we'd go out
and we'd have a nice...

11:48.341 --> 11:50.341
Sintra, this is
Sergeant Greevey.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.476
This is Sintra More,

11:51.478 --> 11:53.411
Mr. More's daughter
by his first marriage.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.214
My father did not
commit suicide.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.016
Miss More, I know...

11:58.018 --> 11:59.484
I grew up
in my father's world.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.853
Yeah, daddy was bisexual.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.055
Anyone that knew him knew that

12:04.057 --> 12:07.225
but he never
would have committed suicide.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.894
This may not mean
anything to you,

12:09.896 --> 12:12.363
but he was my father,
and I knew him.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.065
He was happy, very happy.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.936
He was excited
about the Popa Show.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.305
But even if he had been
massively unhappy,

12:20.307 --> 12:22.474
he would have never
committed suicide.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.109
How do you know?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.044
He was Catholic.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.151
MAN:
<i> gentlemen,very sick picture,</i>

12:33.153 --> 12:35.053
but it's
a very good print.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.855
Forefinger, perfect.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.323
What else you got?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.858
Oval smudge
on the back.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.359
Could have been
gloves.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.896
So at some point
our friend took one glove off.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.965
Must have.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.033
Oh, and the guy had
oil on his hand...

12:49.035 --> 12:51.102
some kind of
acidic base.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.437
Lemon oil, maybe.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.438
Oh, great.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.140
Now all we got to do

12:55.142 --> 12:57.442
is print everyone
who knew him.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.111
Victor had Con Ed bills

13:00.113 --> 13:02.347
like the national debt.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.516
Bought a Sam Cooke
collection.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.351
That's my taste
in music.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.454
Armani suits.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.491
Not your taste in clothes.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.059
Gave to Big Brothers,
Save the Earth,

13:15.061 --> 13:16.795
world education.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.564
Guy had a social conscience.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.901
That's the only kind
of conscience he had.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.403
Sent a check home every month
more than my salary.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.474
Good son.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.476
Took care of Mom and Dad.

13:31.478 --> 13:36.080
Hey, he should have taken
better care of himself.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.215
Whoa.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.919
Bill of sale
for one of his pictures

13:40.921 --> 13:42.053
dated yesterday.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.556
To be picked up
at his loft in the p.m.

13:44.558 --> 13:45.890
Name and address?

13:45.892 --> 13:47.826
LOGAN:
<i> 60 East 77th Street.</i>

13:48.562 --> 13:49.561
Yes?

13:49.563 --> 13:50.995
Do I know you?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.831
GREEVEY:
No, but I know you.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.098
Henry Rothman.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.401
The commissioner
of artistic affairs.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.570
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

13:58.572 --> 13:59.571
ROTHMAN:
How do you do?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.072
May we come in?

14:01.074 --> 14:03.441
You see this painting?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.978
I paid $3,000 for it
20 years ago.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.113
Now it's worth 30.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.149
That one over there--

14:11.151 --> 14:13.117
that's a Metzger.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.521
Got it for 1,000 in 1972.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.523
Now it's worth 60.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.058
The Zauer there--

14:20.060 --> 14:21.259
paid ten grand.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.861
Worth 70.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.196
The Victor More,
I paid 4,000.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.098
And 20 years from now?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.567
Well, you know, you buy
a good bottle of wine,

14:29.569 --> 14:31.102
you put it in the cellar

14:31.104 --> 14:33.571
and you hope it doesn't
turn to vinegar.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.573
Did you know
Victor More well?

14:35.575 --> 14:36.875
No.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.010
Cocktail parties,
gallery openings.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.245
I met him a few times.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.146
Did you pick up
your photograph yesterday?

14:42.148 --> 14:45.183
I was stuck in a meeting,
couldn't break away.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.885
You better get it.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.586
He won't be taking
any more pictures.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.955
So, you probably
doubled your money.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.124
GREEVEY:
<i> I don't know, Mike.</i>

14:53.126 --> 14:55.560
When I was your age,
we had scandals...

14:55.562 --> 14:57.562
Maybe the rich
are different.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.297
They weren't weird
like this.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.667
You know, some jerk caught
running around on his wife,

15:02.669 --> 15:04.602
some chippie caught
cheating on her old man,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.070
but nowadays,
whoo...

15:06.072 --> 15:08.539
Yeah, like the guy
in Palm Beach,

15:08.541 --> 15:11.576
had the wife who did it
with a trumpet.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.914
What do you do
with a trumpet?

15:19.085 --> 15:23.187
In the Middle Ages,
artists painted madonnas.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.606
In the 19th century,

15:24.607 --> 15:26.024
they painted
water lilies.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.594
Andy Warhol signed a soup can
and sold it for a fortune.

15:29.596 --> 15:33.064
Artists paint what the public
has an appetite for.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.599
What about
his private life?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.102
As far as
I'm concerned,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.604
Victor More was either
a pornographer who got lucky

15:39.606 --> 15:43.207
or he was an opportunist
who created for the market.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.510
Either way, he was no artist.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.078
So how did he
get lucky?

15:47.080 --> 15:51.115
Well, Victor More
had many talents.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.686
One of them was photography.

15:54.688 --> 15:58.089
Another was getting grants.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.992
Grants from the city.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.160
That's my job.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.229
I decide who gets
your tax money, and mine,

16:05.231 --> 16:06.631
for artistic work.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.299
Mr. Rothman doesn't decide that?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.300
Oh, yes.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.202
Mr. Rothman decides, too.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.304
Mr. Rothman has
the final authority.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.975
The city gave a lot of grants
to Victor More.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.610
Don't ask me to explain
Mr. Rothman's taste.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.611
He has none.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.280
His decisions are arbitrary

16:22.282 --> 16:24.549
and have nothing
to do with art.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.585
Miss Swenson,
didn't you approve these grants?

16:27.587 --> 16:29.253
Your signature is on them.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.388
I approved them.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.256
I didn't approve of them.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.358
Why did you sign them?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.061
Mr. Rothman
is the commissioner.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.162
I work for the commissioner.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.031
I have to sign the forms

16:40.033 --> 16:43.134
or they won't
disburse the check.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.402
Does that make it clear?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.137
Mr. Rothman
and Mr. More--

16:46.139 --> 16:47.205
were they close?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.206
Financially

16:48.208 --> 16:50.775
or personally?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.244
Are you saying
that Mr. Rothman...?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.380
I shouldn't engage in gossip.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.185
Three months ago,
this $50,000...

17:01.187 --> 17:03.204
Oh, that one.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.222
I registered my disapproval
in writing.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.158
Mr. Rothman overruled me.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.428
But at least Mr. More
didn't get the money.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.598
That $50,000
was an attempt

17:13.600 --> 17:16.134
to elevate Mr. More
out of the gutter.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.236
It's paying
for a show of his work

17:18.238 --> 17:20.138
at the Pavilion of Popular Art.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.808
Captain thinks
he's got a media problem?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.811
How about the commissioner
sleeping with the victim?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.447
Maybe she's got
an axe to grind.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.816
You know, Rothman's
in a scandal,

17:31.818 --> 17:33.718
she gets made
commissioner.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.720
Or maybe she
just finds him

17:35.722 --> 17:37.355
as disgusting as I do.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.829
You like this?

17:44.831 --> 17:48.066
One of our young curators
liked it.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.333
I think it's junk.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.735
And Victor More?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.738
His death didn't make
his pictures any better.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.207
But you're still going
to give him a show?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.076
Let me explain
something to you.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.477
That show is being put on

17:59.479 --> 18:02.213
because the city put up
part of the money

18:02.215 --> 18:03.714
and the rest of it

18:03.716 --> 18:06.084
is coming from one
of our private patrons.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.318
Let me take a guess.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.853
Henry Rothman.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.387
Mr. Rothman
could hardly afford it.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.657
Elizabeth Hendrick.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.225
As in the Hendricks

18:14.227 --> 18:16.427
who own the
entire world?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.229
Would you do this show

18:18.231 --> 18:20.665
if Hendrick and the city
weren't paying for it?

18:20.667 --> 18:24.735
Detective, there is no art
without money.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.773
Miss Hendrick,
the circumstances

18:28.775 --> 18:30.241
of Victor More's death--

18:30.243 --> 18:33.244
don't you find that shocking?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.346
van Gogh cut off his ear.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.784
Edvard Munch hung half
of his paintings in the woods

18:39.786 --> 18:42.153
where they ended up rotting.

18:42.155 --> 18:46.190
Gauguin abandoned his family
and went to Tahiti.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.126
Art would be much more pleasant

18:48.128 --> 18:50.895
if we didn't have to deal
with artists.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.434
Did you know Mr. More
or his friends?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.802
I understand

18:57.804 --> 19:00.204
Mr. More was a private person.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.772
Reclusive.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.209
You seem surprised
that I'm not shocked.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.911
I'm surprised you are.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.147
You have to deal with--

19:09.149 --> 19:11.382
what did the newspapers
call it?--

19:11.384 --> 19:12.383
sleaze

19:12.385 --> 19:13.818
all the time.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.253
The sleaze we deal with

19:15.255 --> 19:17.555
doesn't usually end up
hanging in a museum.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.858
Victor More was a good artist.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.829
Would I want
to sit down to dinner with him?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.264
No.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.317
I'm sorry.

19:29.318 --> 19:32.369
I am late for a meeting,
so if there's nothing else...

19:35.875 --> 19:38.409
You never carried these
with gold chain?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.278
We might have.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.414
And you don't know
Elizabeth Hendrick.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.284
The customers
don't wear name tags.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.952
I just take their money.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.188
Mike, I must be crazy,
but why do I think

19:50.190 --> 19:53.524
that Cathy knows exactly
who Elizabeth Hendrick is?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.193
And I might be crazy

19:55.195 --> 19:57.395
but I think a lot of
the respectable citizens

19:57.397 --> 19:59.197
that come and
buy this sicko stuff

19:59.199 --> 20:01.365
might decide
they didn't need it

20:01.367 --> 20:03.968
if we put a police cruiser
out front.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.270
I think Elizabeth Hendrick

20:06.272 --> 20:07.972
might have been in here
once or twice.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.307
Or more.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.474
Yes, maybe.

20:10.476 --> 20:14.245
Maybe three or four times.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.948
I have received over a hundred
phone calls in the last hour.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.350
A commissioner is being dragged
through the mud

20:19.352 --> 20:20.885
and it looks like
we're responsible.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.820
I hope you have something.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.856
It gets worse.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.425
How can it
get worse?

20:27.426 --> 20:28.993
What would you say
if I told you that

20:28.995 --> 20:31.462
Elizabeth Hendrick
is connected to this?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.264
That's worse.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.567
LOGAN:
Doesn't everybody who works
for the city get printed?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.369
You do,
commissioners don't.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.404
Find Rothman's prints
somewhere.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.007
See if he was in
the army or something.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.008
What about Hendrick?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.244
Unless she served

20:46.246 --> 20:49.313
on a grand jury or applied
for a gun license, good luck.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.251
ROTHMAN:
<i> Are you telling me</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:56.387
that I am a suspect
in the murder of Victor More?

20:56.389 --> 20:58.856
Yes, sir, you are.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.926
Could you tell us
where you were that night?

21:01.928 --> 21:06.030
Look, I have
a wife and three children.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.566
I have a wife and three
children myself.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.269
Then you'll realize
why I'd prefer it

21:11.271 --> 21:14.038
if where I was that night
didn't become public.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.340
Can't guarantee that.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.650
I was with another woman
the night Victor More died.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.353
Elizabeth Hendrick.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.425
I was home alone that night.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.594
You didn't see
Henry Rothman at any time?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.062
You're not suggesting

21:38.064 --> 21:41.299
that I'm having an affair
with Mr. Rothman?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.300
Actually,

21:42.302 --> 21:45.469
Mr. Rothman
suggested that.

21:45.471 --> 21:49.674
Detective, I went to bed
early that night... alone.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.545
Boy, oh, boy.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.613
They are really letting
Rothman swing in the wind.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.416
He says he was
with Hendricks.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.884
She says she was alone.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.319
Neither alibi works.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.520
So maybe they're both innocent.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.921
Or both guilty.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.956
We put one of them
in the room with More,

22:05.958 --> 22:08.626
the D.A. will go
for manslaughter one.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.294
All the D.A. wants
is a signed confession.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.961
The D.A. needs a signed...
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

22:11.964 --> 22:12.963
Cragen.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.032
Yes.

22:15.034 --> 22:18.469
Uh-huh.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.637
Uh-huh.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.007
Hendrick's print doesn't match.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.041
Rothman's does.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.710
I think
it's time

22:25.712 --> 22:28.012
we paid Mr. Rothman a visit

22:28.014 --> 22:29.747
and read him his rights,
gentlemen.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.053
Commissioner
Rothman.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.990
Excuse me
a second.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.560
We're late
for the theater.

22:42.562 --> 22:47.031
Sir, if we could have
a moment of your time.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.032
Go on. Go on.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.500
What for?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.502
We have a warrant,
Mr. Rothman.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.003
MRS. ROTHMAN:
A warrant?

22:53.005 --> 22:55.072
Listen to me.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.007
Just come away with us.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.378
Don't make me have to cuff you
and read you your rights

23:00.380 --> 23:02.747
in front of your kids.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.522
Just a minute.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.094
Look, I'll catch up with you
at intermission.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.095
Go on.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.497
It's nothing.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.065
It's a mistake.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.180
How does the defendant plead?

23:36.182 --> 23:38.332
The defendant pleads
not guilty, Your Honor.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.483
The defense would like to
make a motion that the defendant

23:40.486 --> 23:42.019
be set free
on his own recognizance.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.021
Your Honor,
if it pleases the court...

23:44.023 --> 23:45.890
Just a minute, Mr. Stone,
she isn't finished.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.925
Go ahead, Ms. Stohlmeyer.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.027
Your Honor, my client
has no criminal record.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.029
He has obvious ties
to the community.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.899
He's a respected and
distinguished man.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.835
Your Honor, this is a homicide
of a gruesome kind.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.472
The prosecution
feels that bail is essential.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.873
We recommend $100,000.

24:02.875 --> 24:08.746
Your Honor, my client
presents no risk of flight.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.782
$100,000
is ridiculous.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.919
Mr. Stone's recommendation
is a little high,

24:14.921 --> 24:16.654
but this is a homicide.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.456
Bail is set at $50,000.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.462
Are you deliberately
trying to make this unpleasant?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.797
We trained you pretty well.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.933
How do you like it
on the other side?

24:28.935 --> 24:30.534
Well, the pay is better.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.069
Is that your problem?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.472
I just don't like
the class of clients you choose.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.474
Murderers, drug dealers...

24:36.476 --> 24:37.759
You should be a
more discriminating.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.043
And youshould be
more discriminating--

24:39.045 --> 24:41.545
filing manslaughter one
charges.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.547
You haven't got a case, Ben.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.548
That fingerprint could
have been on that Polaroid

24:45.551 --> 24:47.084
months before More died.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.054
You can get a grand jury
will indict a ham sandwich.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.022
If you indict Rothman,

24:52.024 --> 24:53.023
you're crazy.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.493
Erica, your client's alibi

24:55.495 --> 24:59.497
has been refuted
by his alibi witness.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.699
Elizabeth Hendrick
made a mistake.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.268
I assure you,
she'll tell the truth.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.103
Erica will argue

25:06.104 --> 25:07.937
that More consented
to being tortured.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.107
She can just about prove
he liked being beaten up,

25:10.109 --> 25:11.542
but I can work around that.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.677
You can consent
to being tortured,

25:13.679 --> 25:14.812
but you can't consent to murder.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.680
Still have to prove intent.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.016
Do we know that
Rothman wanted to hurt him?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.851
We will.

25:20.853 --> 25:21.919
Rothman absolutely at the scene?

25:21.921 --> 25:23.020
Fingerprint?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.121
The Polaroids
are identical,

25:24.123 --> 25:25.890
practically down
to the shadows

25:25.892 --> 25:27.858
of the ones the police
photographers took.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.060
That will fly.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.062
I just want to be clear
about one thing.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.064
I don't care

25:34.065 --> 25:36.065
what consenting adults do in
their bedrooms, or elsewhere--

25:36.068 --> 25:38.302
that's their business--

25:38.304 --> 25:41.005
but Rothman is a public figure.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.108
He's a role model.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.111
He has an obligation
not to behave like this.

25:47.113 --> 25:52.149
And Hendrick...
if she's involved, go after her.

25:52.151 --> 25:55.052
I don't want even a hintof a
double standard for the rich.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.688
We've got to put Rothman
at the scene more convincingly.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.723
Go back over the evidence.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.561
Tear his life apart
until something turns up.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.066
The medical examiner's report

26:09.068 --> 26:11.101
says there was oil
on the victim's body.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.720
Can you match it

26:12.721 --> 26:14.338
to the oil in the fingerprint
on the photograph?

26:14.340 --> 26:15.706
I get it.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.041
You want to put the body
and the photograph

26:17.043 --> 26:18.809
in the same time frame.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.679
If the hand touched his body
and the picture,

26:21.681 --> 26:24.348
it means the picture
was taken the night he died.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.766
That's right.

26:25.767 --> 26:27.183
We're working
with very small amounts.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.086
I don't want to
damage the print.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.955
Can you do it?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.090
Ask me tomorrow.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.059
The tox scan
is negative.

26:35.061 --> 26:38.662
No heroin, no coke,
no codeine... nothing.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.064
Run another tox scan.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.198
See if can...

26:41.200 --> 26:44.668
Whoa, whoa,
who's paying for this?

26:44.670 --> 26:45.803
It's a homicide investigation.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.671
Stone will approve it.

26:47.673 --> 26:48.806
The man hanged himself.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.708
Does it matter what he had
in his blood?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.942
It matters.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.945
What are we looking for?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.080
Synthetics.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.148
M.D.A., speed, methaqualone.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.085
Exactly what I'd take
if I were going

27:01.087 --> 27:03.821
to hang myself.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.756
There's no case
here, Ben.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.690
My client is not compelled
to rescue somebody

27:07.693 --> 27:09.059
who's risking
his own life.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.761
That's one way
of looking at it,

27:10.763 --> 27:12.480
I think he's guilty
of manslaughter.

27:12.481 --> 27:14.198
Then why do you want to bring
him in front of a grand jury?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.200
I want to know
what happened.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.835
Grant him immunity

27:17.837 --> 27:19.837
and he'll testify
against Hendrick.

27:19.839 --> 27:23.107
If he pleads manslaughter one,
that's discussable.

27:23.109 --> 27:27.077
You can't convict him
of manslaughter one.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.847
That's what juries
are for, Erica--

27:29.849 --> 27:34.818
to decide which one
of us is right.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.055
I'll talk
to my client.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.824
The commissioner
always treated me fine.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.810
He's a fine gentleman.

27:42.811 --> 27:44.795
You sure he never had an
appointment with Victor More?

27:44.797 --> 27:47.264
I keep his appointment book.

27:47.266 --> 27:51.135
You've worked
for other city agencies?

27:51.137 --> 27:54.138
I was secretary
to deputy commissioners.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.656
And Commissioner Rothman

27:55.657 --> 27:57.173
never did anything
out of the ordinary?

27:57.176 --> 28:02.746
He has these long phone calls,
and sometimes

28:02.748 --> 28:05.282
I couldn't get him off
to go to meetings.

28:05.284 --> 28:09.820
He'd talk right through them,
an hour, hour-and-a-half, and...

28:09.822 --> 28:13.123
when he came out,
he'd be all pale and sweaty.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.697
The local usage details
for Rothman's home phone

28:19.699 --> 28:21.832
have dozens of long
calls to Hendrick--

28:21.834 --> 28:23.967
on the weekend, four,
five, six times a day.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.836
Hers have as many
calls to him.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.705
The night of the murder?

28:27.707 --> 28:30.074
A call from Rothman
to Victor More.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.842
What the hell were
Hendrick and Rothman

28:31.844 --> 28:33.110
talking about
the rest of the time?

28:33.112 --> 28:34.778
ERICA:
<i> You are only going to indict</i>

28:34.780 --> 28:36.814
because he's being hung
in the press.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.718
STONE:
Somebody got very careless here
with a human life, Erica.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.820
Your client still has no alibi.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.956
Hendrick hasn't budged--
she never even saw him.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.325
You want to tell us about
your relationship with her.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.828
Maybe we can help her
change her mind.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.330
I have nothing to say
about Miss Hendrick.

28:53.332 --> 28:57.167
Commissioner, you know what our
prisons are like these days.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.203
You're going
to be in one for a long time.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.338
You want to go alone?

29:03.909 --> 29:07.344
Miss Hendrick
will do the right thing.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.149
Let's go, Henry.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.258
Judge Fadenhecht?

29:21.260 --> 29:24.161
Judge Fadenhecht?
Your Honor?

29:24.163 --> 29:26.029
I hope this is
important, Mr. Stone.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.765
I need a tap warrant.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.167
Anybody going to put my ass
in a sling if I say yes?

29:30.169 --> 29:31.135
You got cause?

29:31.137 --> 29:33.103
Rock solid, Your Honor.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.772
(<i> toilet flushing</i> )

29:34.774 --> 29:36.340
Call my office.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.779
ROTHMAN:
I need your protection.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.781
You have to tell...

29:43.783 --> 29:45.015
Henry.
HENDRICK:

29:45.017 --> 29:48.252
what I tell you.
You do exactly

29:48.254 --> 29:49.253
Yes, Elizabeth.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.554
Whatever you say.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.023
your mouth shut.
First, Henry, keep

29:53.025 --> 29:56.026
moron lawyer of yours.
Especially with that

29:56.028 --> 29:58.896
to the prosecutors,
Second, don't talk

29:58.898 --> 30:00.264
don't call me.
and third,

30:00.266 --> 30:01.899
Do you understand?

30:01.901 --> 30:02.900
Yes.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.034
Yes, what?

30:04.036 --> 30:07.237
I understand.
Yes, Elizabeth,

30:10.142 --> 30:12.276
Sure sounds like
she could have been with him.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.145
It sounds like he's her slave...

30:15.147 --> 30:16.413
literally.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.248
If she's
into this scene,

30:18.250 --> 30:20.417
if she is
the dominant one,

30:20.419 --> 30:23.220
what was going on that night?

30:25.124 --> 30:27.224
<i>Every relationship, Mr. Stone--</i>

30:27.226 --> 30:30.093
work, at home
with your wife and kids--

30:30.095 --> 30:32.896
every relationship
is about power.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.132
But I don't beat people up
for kicks.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.001
A dominatrix--

30:37.002 --> 30:38.869
a woman who plays
the dominant role

30:38.871 --> 30:40.437
in a sexual relationship--

30:40.439 --> 30:43.907
would she play the same role
in another situation,

30:43.909 --> 30:48.178
not a sexual one, but one
that was emotionally charged?

30:48.180 --> 30:52.149
It's learned behavior--
operant conditioning.

30:52.151 --> 30:56.153
Press the right button,
you get the right response.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.122
The question
is finding the button.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.924
Forensics says the oil

31:00.926 --> 31:04.061
on the Polaroid fingerprint
is the same as on the body.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.430
That ought to establish
the picture was taken

31:06.432 --> 31:07.865
when More died.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.367
This is going
to be a pleasure.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.102
Adam, new tox report.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.105
Victor had methaqualone
in his blood.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.241
Probably black market from Goa.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.878
If he was on ludes,
diminished mental capacity.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.380
He was in no condition
to protect himself.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.183
Time to put a little pressure
on the commissioner.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.351
Why not on Hendrick?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.220
She was in charge.
He's the weak one.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.088
Because, the only pressure
on Hendrick is Rothman.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.090
Doesn't seem right.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.093
Paul, we have one murderer
we can indict by a hair

31:36.095 --> 31:38.228
and another we're
not even near.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.097
Yeah, something's
got to give.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.232
It's going to be
Commissioner Rothman.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.369
Ben, you ready
to make a deal?

31:45.371 --> 31:47.671
You're not going
to like it.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.140
I'm going to indict
your client

31:50.142 --> 31:51.675
for manslaughter one.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.946
Unless you have something
I don't know about...

31:55.948 --> 31:58.315
Do I have to file
a discovery motion?

31:58.317 --> 32:01.084
Victor More had methaqualone
in his blood.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.286
A jury is not going to believe

32:02.288 --> 32:05.255
that he had the capacity
to protect himself.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.292
Nobody intended
to kill Victor More.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.127
You have
to prove intent

32:10.129 --> 32:11.128
and you can't.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.462
(<i> knock on door</i> )

32:14.266 --> 32:16.133
Have a seat,
Mr. Rothman.

32:16.135 --> 32:19.002
We were just discussing
your state of mind

32:19.004 --> 32:21.138
the night you
killed Victor More.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.273
I thought we were here
to make a deal.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.410
Sit down, Henry, and
don't say anything.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.278
No matter what you think

32:28.280 --> 32:30.547
my client was doing
with Victor More,

32:30.549 --> 32:34.017
this was a guy who begged to
be hurt as part of the game.

32:34.019 --> 32:35.252
He was a masochist.

32:35.254 --> 32:36.486
He didn't beg to die.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.121
I'll tell you right
now what I'm going

32:38.123 --> 32:40.223
to tell a jury, if
there ever is one.

32:40.225 --> 32:42.526
Victor More
committed suicide.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.328
You can't prove he didn't.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.265
Try me.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.739
Criminally negligent homicide.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.241
He serves three months, maximum.

32:58.243 --> 33:00.544
We stay with
manslaughter one.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.212
Your client waives immunity.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.181
I'll recommend
a minimum sentence

33:04.183 --> 33:06.116
if he rolls on Hendrick.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.184
He's insignificant.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.318
He's a cog.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.520
She ordered him
to do what he did.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.589
His mistake is he still
thinks she can help him.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.257
I'm in charge here.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.193
I'll crush your client.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.195
We're not talking
dirty pictures,

33:18.197 --> 33:19.529
we're talking death.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.398
A crime's been committed.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.166
And the guilty will pay.

33:23.168 --> 33:27.170
Does he want the deal
or not?

33:27.172 --> 33:29.006
Forget it.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.213
I forgot it. No deal.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.116
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.154
It wasn't me.

33:44.156 --> 33:47.024
She didorder me
to do it.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.126
I-I wanted to save him.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.461
She wouldn't let me.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.400
I guess you get your deal.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.242
We have court-ordered permission
to search the premises.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.445
This warrant
covers your apartment, your car,

34:08.447 --> 34:11.548
and all your personal
possessions.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.583
Would you like some coffee?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.452
ROBINETTE:
Ben?

34:17.122 --> 34:18.255
Yeah?

34:18.257 --> 34:20.257
Looks like
black market ludes.

34:20.259 --> 34:23.160
Maybe the same kind
they found in Victor.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.327
MAN:
Mr. Stone?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.266
This is locked.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.234
You have the key?

34:39.411 --> 34:41.478
It's my hope chest.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.253
What were you hoping for?

34:54.493 --> 34:58.428
consenting to certain activities
and games, and one of them dies.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.163
Who's responsible?

35:00.165 --> 35:02.532
You think Hendrick is.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.301
And all I have

35:04.303 --> 35:05.836
is the uncorroborated testimony
of an accomplice.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.838
I think in Albania
they'll get you a conviction.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.306
What about the pills?

35:09.308 --> 35:12.142
Tough,<i> if</i> they're
chemically the same,

35:12.144 --> 35:14.878
<i>if</i> an expert doesn't
knock the toxicology.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.847
"Circumstantial"
isn't the word.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.849
Try and the jury laughs
on the way out.

35:18.851 --> 35:21.384
No law against owning
a leather jacket.

35:21.386 --> 35:24.855
There might be one against what
you do when you're wearing it.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.190
Okay, so I sold Miss Hendrick
the leather.

35:27.192 --> 35:28.325
So what?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.160
Ever hang out
with her?

35:30.162 --> 35:31.862
Is that a joke?

35:31.864 --> 35:34.798
How well<i> do</i> you know
Elizabeth Hendrick?

35:34.800 --> 35:38.902
Look, I... don't get close
to the customers.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.905
They're all playing
with 51 cards.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.141
Cathy,
a man is dead.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.575
It's about murder.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.882
There's a couple of clubs,

35:51.884 --> 35:55.852
one where a lot
of rich people go.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.487
It's Club X.

36:05.898 --> 36:07.548
So you got some
Amazon blonde freak

36:07.549 --> 36:09.199
who says this
Hendrick person was here?

36:09.201 --> 36:10.300
And you...

36:10.302 --> 36:12.903
And I say get the hell
out of my club.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.472
I'll be back
with a subpoena.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.549
I can't discuss my customers.

36:25.551 --> 36:28.518
It's like doctor-patient
confidentiality.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.920
Mr. Celine,

36:29.922 --> 36:31.454
as legal advisor
to the grand jury,

36:31.456 --> 36:34.224
I advise you that the law
of the State of New York

36:34.226 --> 36:36.393
recognizes no such privilege
and no such confidentiality,

36:36.395 --> 36:37.494
and I direct you, sir,

36:37.496 --> 36:39.462
to answer
the question.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.898
I run the place.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.501
I'm not responsible
for what goes on in it.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.571
You are here under subpoena
and under oath.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.272
You'll answer the questions

36:49.274 --> 36:50.607
or you will go to jail.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.943
Your own attorney
will verify that for you,

36:52.945 --> 36:54.878
and therefore,
I ask you again, sir:

36:54.880 --> 36:58.348
Was Elizabeth Hendrick a
dues-paying member of your club?

36:59.685 --> 37:01.351
She was a member.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.886
She paid dues.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.688
What did she do when she
came to your club?

37:04.690 --> 37:08.325
She...

37:08.327 --> 37:10.427
She liked to have slaves.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.596
And what did she
do with her slaves?

37:12.598 --> 37:17.434
She liked to watch things
get a little out of control.

37:17.436 --> 37:21.404
How out of control, Mr. Celine?

37:21.406 --> 37:27.677
Last month, she had this slave,
and... it got crazy.

37:27.679 --> 37:31.014
Damn near killed the kid.

37:31.016 --> 37:34.417
Gary... Gary something.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.686
Pardee.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.256
Gary Pardee.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.991
Gary, you got hurt.

37:40.993 --> 37:44.527
It's our business
if people get hurt.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.396
Who actually
hit you?

37:46.398 --> 37:47.964
It was Rothman.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.317
She told him to do it,

37:50.318 --> 37:52.669
but it just went a little
further than it was supposed to.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.904
Why didn't you
press charges?

37:54.906 --> 37:57.407
What does that make me
look like?

37:57.409 --> 37:59.309
I agreed to it.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.311
It was probably my fault

38:01.313 --> 38:03.046
for getting involved
in the first place.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.949
Don't force me to testify.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.518
It will ruin my career.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.455
I'm perfect for young dad parts
in commercials.

38:12.457 --> 38:16.359
He's useless at a trial.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.628
He'd be a reluctant witness,
and you can only bring him in

38:18.630 --> 38:20.730
if the character issue
is opened up.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.565
Worse. If he says
it's his own fault,

38:22.567 --> 38:24.501
he can be used
against us.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.704
Makes the responsibility
question real muddy.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.008
And on that evening,
did you hurt Mr. More?

38:32.010 --> 38:36.413
Miss Hendrick told me
to slap him on the legs.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.381
You slapped him with your hands?

38:38.383 --> 38:39.649
Yes.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.951
No, I was wearing gloves.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.689
And where was Mr. More
when all this was happening?

38:45.691 --> 38:50.427
He was standing on a chair
with a noose around his neck

38:50.429 --> 38:54.664
and he lifted his
legs off the chair.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.433
He, uh...

38:56.435 --> 38:59.769
accidentally
kicked the chair over.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.805
I went to pick it up,

39:01.807 --> 39:05.408
but Miss Hendrick
ordered me not to.

39:05.410 --> 39:10.480
Elizabeth Hendrick ordered you
to let Mr. More hang to death

39:10.482 --> 39:12.382
and you did?

39:12.384 --> 39:14.751
You have to understand.

39:14.753 --> 39:18.388
I had to do what she told me.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.524
You had to do what she told you?

39:21.526 --> 39:26.062
It was part of our game.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.698
It's still ten million miles
from Hendrick,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.634
even with the drugs
and diminished capacity.

39:31.636 --> 39:34.838
Our own case says her role
in the death is indirect.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.707
If I can get her
on the stand,

39:37.709 --> 39:40.009
I can bring her down.

39:40.011 --> 39:44.481
You know that Henry Rothman
killed Victor More, don't you?

39:44.483 --> 39:46.483
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.418
At least we have
that straight.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.453
Elizabeth,
I have to recommend...

39:50.455 --> 39:51.688
I'll handle this, Jay.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.857
On the stand, if
you were effective

39:53.859 --> 39:55.425
in presenting your side,
you'd clear yourself.

39:55.427 --> 39:56.726
You grant me immunity,

39:56.728 --> 39:58.661
and then I'll testify
against him.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.130
I'm afraid I can't do
that, Miss Hendricks.

40:00.132 --> 40:02.732
That's what you're going
to do, Mr. Stone.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.669
You don't think the grand jury
will believe you, do you?

40:06.671 --> 40:09.706
You never know, do you?

40:11.476 --> 40:13.610
I'll waive immunity.

40:13.612 --> 40:17.113
I'll see you at the grand jury.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.782
Thank you.

40:21.553 --> 40:22.852
She has to engage me,

40:22.854 --> 40:24.654
if she doesn't it'll
make her look weak.

40:24.656 --> 40:28.158
It's one of the longest shots
you've ever played.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.759
She wants to
dominate me.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.562
I'm going to give
her the chance.

40:34.499 --> 40:38.501
That question has an ugly
implication, Mr. Stone.

40:38.503 --> 40:39.903
I'm sorry.

40:39.905 --> 40:45.575
Could you rephrase
it for me?

40:45.577 --> 40:48.511
You asked
if I gave the men drugs.

40:48.513 --> 40:52.115
You implied
I gave them illegal drugs.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.518
Mr. Rothman and Mr. More
took drugs

40:55.520 --> 40:56.786
but not because
they got them from me.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.690
I'm sorry if
I offended you.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.232
You were accustomed
to playing games

41:09.234 --> 41:11.568
with Mr. Rothman,
weren't you?

41:11.570 --> 41:14.504
Mr. More invited me to join him

41:14.506 --> 41:17.674
in what he called
a performance artwork.

41:17.676 --> 41:20.944
We were rehearsing it
with Mr. Rothman.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.812
We'd done this before,

41:22.814 --> 41:26.149
but the men were never
very good at it

41:26.151 --> 41:29.219
so I was doing my best
to help them.

41:29.221 --> 41:33.523
I left the men alone
for just a few minutes.

41:33.525 --> 41:38.561
When I returned,
I found Mr. More dead

41:38.563 --> 41:43.566
and the chair several feet away.

41:43.568 --> 41:47.570
Mr. Rothman was sobbing
on the floor,

41:47.572 --> 41:51.241
and he kept saying
over and over again

41:51.243 --> 41:54.777
"I let him die."

41:54.779 --> 42:00.283
It was a tragic mistake
made by incompetent men.

42:00.285 --> 42:05.154
I know I should never
have left them alone.

42:05.156 --> 42:08.992
You knew you should never
have left them alone?

42:08.994 --> 42:12.629
Does that mean you knew
that Victor More

42:12.631 --> 42:14.664
would be hurt if you did?

42:17.235 --> 42:20.570
I mean, I...

42:20.572 --> 42:25.008
I know<i> now,</i> I shouldn't
have left them alone.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.178
She sounds crazy

42:29.180 --> 42:31.548
but the question is,
does she sound crazy enough?

42:31.550 --> 42:32.949
The question is

42:32.951 --> 42:35.318
does she sound
guilty enough?

42:39.958 --> 42:41.758
Hey, Ben.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Rothman has told me

42:50.302 --> 42:53.570
he feels his previous testimony
was incomplete

42:53.572 --> 42:56.573
and he's asked for an
opportunity to expand on it.

42:56.575 --> 43:01.311
I lied to you
the last time I testified.

43:01.313 --> 43:06.950
I am solely responsible
for Victor More's death.

43:06.952 --> 43:09.319
Miss Hendrick was not
in the room at the time.

43:09.321 --> 43:11.854
I take full
responsibility.

43:15.927 --> 43:20.330
Did you have a conversation
with Miss Hendrick during lunch?

43:23.969 --> 43:25.802
Mr. Rothman,
I asked you,

43:25.804 --> 43:28.338
did you have a conversation
with Elizabeth Hendrick?

43:28.340 --> 43:29.806
Yes.

43:29.808 --> 43:31.708
Did she order you
to come back in here

43:31.710 --> 43:34.243
and change your testimony?

43:34.245 --> 43:37.280
I killed Victor More.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.115
Just the way

43:39.116 --> 43:40.949
she ordered you to
the night Victor More died.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.819
Miss Hendrick had
nothing to do with it.

43:42.821 --> 43:46.089
Mr. Rothman, you realize
that these statements

43:46.091 --> 43:48.725
will invalidate
the plea bargaining

43:48.727 --> 43:50.360
which you entered into?

43:52.931 --> 43:55.932
Miss Hendrick
had nothing to do with it.

44:07.045 --> 44:08.311
Stone...

44:08.313 --> 44:09.779
Max Greevey.

44:09.781 --> 44:13.316
I'm in the late
Henry Rothman's office.

44:13.318 --> 44:17.120
I think you should
get over here right away.

44:17.122 --> 44:20.323
(<i> laughing</i> )

44:44.716 --> 44:46.382
Mr. Stone,

44:46.384 --> 44:48.017
I didn't expect
to see you here.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.719
You may not have
heard the news yet

44:49.721 --> 44:51.320
but your friend Henry Rothman

44:51.322 --> 44:53.122
killed himself this afternoon.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.692
Couldn't face jail,
I guess.

44:55.694 --> 44:59.128
Hung himself in his office.

45:03.768 --> 45:06.035
Did anyone take a picture?

45:06.037 --> 45:10.840
No, no one took any photos,
but Henry left some.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.942
Polaroids of you

45:12.944 --> 45:15.378
watching More die.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.082
You have the right
to remain silent

45:19.084 --> 45:21.084
and refuse
to answer questions.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.852
Do you understand?

45:22.854 --> 45:26.055
Anything you do say
may be used against you

45:26.057 --> 45:27.356
in a court of law.

45:27.358 --> 45:28.958
Do you understand?

45:28.960 --> 45:28.991
You have the right
to consult an attorney...
