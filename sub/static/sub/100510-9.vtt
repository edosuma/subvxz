00:20.062 --> 00:23.149
Last week on War Zone...

00:23.190 --> 00:25.943
Hitler's dead,
Germany has surrendered,

00:25.985 --> 00:29.864
and thousands of Nazi
scientists await their fate.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.908
So, what the hell do you
suggest we do?

00:32.950 --> 00:34.910
Well, we can't just
leave them here.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.080
I mean, we're not talking about
a couple of MENSA candidates.

00:38.122 --> 00:41.000
We're talking about recruiting
more than a thousand

00:41.041 --> 00:43.544
of the most brilliant minds
the world has ever seen.

00:43.586 --> 00:46.255
Who also perpetrated
the most ungodly war crimes

00:46.297 --> 00:47.423
in all of history.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.883
I'm not sure how we explain that

00:48.924 --> 00:50.134
to the American people.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.302
We start by explaining

00:51.343 --> 00:52.845
we don't want these fuckers

00:52.887 --> 00:55.014
to become a viable war power
in the future.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.265
Then we explain what happens

00:56.307 --> 00:59.477
when the Soviets
get their hands on them.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.979
We're not duping America,
we're protecting her.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.774
Which is exactly what these
amoral opportunists

01:04.815 --> 01:06.525
are counting on you to say.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.128
We can't just ignore
their blatant disregard

01:08.152 --> 01:09.361
for human life.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.656
Jewish human life.
Is that an oxymoron?

01:13.783 --> 01:15.868
Gassing women and children.

01:15.910 --> 01:19.371
Sewing twins together to see
if they could be conjoined.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.957
Oh, and my personal favorite,
starving them,

01:21.999 --> 01:24.752
and forcing them to
only drink seawater.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.588
And now you're suggesting
with a straight face

01:27.630 --> 01:30.758
that we just...
hide 'em in America?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.011
You bet your ass I am.

01:34.053 --> 01:36.847
Imagine you were a soldier,
Howard, and your platoon

01:36.889 --> 01:41.060
comes across a loaded Luger
belonging to a dead Nazi.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.146
Do you bury the gun in the sand
because you hated its owner,

01:44.188 --> 01:46.899
or do you pick it up
and use it against your enemy?

01:46.941 --> 01:48.609
Make no mistake about it,

01:48.651 --> 01:51.403
these men's minds are weapons.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.073
Can we really afford to
bury them in the sand

01:54.114 --> 01:55.300
when our enemies could
pick them up

01:55.324 --> 01:57.326
and use them against us?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.955

03:16.906 --> 03:19.533
The boy sleeps like the dead.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.455
No wonder, the way he went after
von Braun back there.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.124
I didn't recognize the kid.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.126
Ruth wasn't wrong about much,

03:29.168 --> 03:33.631
but she was wrong about
keeping him from us.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.301
He was born to be a Hunter,
that boy.

03:37.343 --> 03:40.137
And one day, you'll see,

03:40.179 --> 03:42.181
he will lead the lot of us.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.390
Lead us?

03:43.432 --> 03:45.184
Why, you going somewhere?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.603
Well, we're all going
somewhere sometime.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.900
You know, the first time
I met the kid,

03:52.942 --> 03:55.235
I thought he was just like her.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.863
He reminded me so much of Ruth.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.199
Her mannerisms,
her fiery temper.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.868
Her righteousness.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.496
And now?

04:05.537 --> 04:08.374
Now I don't see her at all.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.542
All I see is you.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.133
That rocket twat

04:18.175 --> 04:20.552
von Braun said
those Nazi tossers

04:20.594 --> 04:23.305
were releasing this "solution"
into a food substitute

04:23.347 --> 04:26.183
- called corn syrup.
- Corn syrup?

04:26.225 --> 04:30.312
I've seen 45 commercials
advertising it in the last week.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.856
Schidler Corp.
"Purify the world."

04:32.898 --> 04:36.068
I've got to give it
to those sadistic bastards,

04:36.110 --> 04:37.695
it's rather brilliant.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.071
Brilliant how?

04:39.113 --> 04:40.990
Corn syrup will be
in everything now.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.117
Food, drink, medicine.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.744
Put that poison-filled
corn syrup into a product

04:45.786 --> 04:47.746
on every supermarket shelf.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.499
Von Braun said they're targeting
every inner city in America.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.043
It could wipe out half
the bloody population.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.009
So how do we fucking
destroy the thing?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.803
Corn syrup's made
by applying heat

05:02.845 --> 05:06.015
to a solution of glucose
and acid...

05:07.766 --> 05:09.893
which would kill the virus.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.230
So they must add it
after the fact.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.416
So, what are you saying?
We should...

05:14.440 --> 05:15.607
Turn the heat up.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.985
500 degrees will do it.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.947
I've got to get back
to the others.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.717
Rocket Man said they could be
distributing the Solution

05:23.741 --> 05:25.159
at any moment.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.202
Be careful, Rebekah.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.432
If you're referring
to anything other than

05:30.456 --> 05:31.790
eradicating this virus...

05:31.832 --> 05:35.627
Tell me this isn't Vienna
all over again.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.339
You going after that child,
putting us all in danger.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.135
You care about them.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.263
And if I can see it, she'll
be able to see it, too.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.892
You've always had more heart
than you'll let anyone know.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.269
Save your weepy
Hallmark recollections

05:52.311 --> 05:54.063
for your therapist, Patricia.

05:54.104 --> 05:58.776
I took out two sodding Nazis
with no verification whatsoever,

05:58.817 --> 06:00.903
putting Meyer and all
of his lot at risk.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.489
So don't you dare
question my loyalty.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.786
And my name is not
fucking Rebekah.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.713
Yeah.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.799
I talked to Millie.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.675
She found an old factory
in New Jersey

06:23.717 --> 06:25.636
she thinks the Schidler Corp.
May be using

06:25.677 --> 06:28.514
to mix the pathogen, it being
so close to New York and all.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.766
She wants us to check it out.

06:30.808 --> 06:33.352
Elizabeth, New Jersey,
is also, coincidentally,

06:33.393 --> 06:35.729
the birthplace of yours truly.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.648
So if we hop on the turnpike,
we can...

06:37.689 --> 06:39.608
Oh, great, the bloody turnpike.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.086
The only thing that would
smell worse

06:41.110 --> 06:43.070
is one of your hangovers
from the early '70s.

06:43.112 --> 06:46.073
Well, you're in a nice mood.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.282
You all right?

06:47.324 --> 06:50.452
Whoa. You look like

06:50.494 --> 06:51.846
you just swallowed
a shit sandwich.

06:51.870 --> 06:52.955
What's going on?

06:52.996 --> 06:55.415
Wait a minute.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.377
Is that real emotion
on your face?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.146
You're about to get
a knuckle sandwich on yours

07:00.170 --> 07:01.450
if you don't pipe the fuck down.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.955
Made the best lasagna
on the Eastern seaboard. Mmm.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.916
Is this your late wife?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.542
Oh, hell no.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.921
Only thing my wife made
was reservations.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.466
No, it was my late
mother-in-law, Dottie.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.177
Also taken too soon.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.221
Hard to believe
only yesterday evening

08:32.262 --> 08:35.182
she was making me
her magical sauce

08:35.224 --> 08:37.434
with the ricotta. Mmm.

08:37.476 --> 08:41.563
Authorities say
you killed her, too.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.524
What do the black folks say
about authority these days?

08:44.566 --> 08:47.653
"Can't trust the po-lice."

08:47.694 --> 08:49.613
I didn't kill Dottie.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.198
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.825
I think someone's after me.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.787
Does this have anything to do
with Nazis plotting an attack

08:56.828 --> 08:58.372
on American soil?

08:58.413 --> 09:02.501
Sounds like someone's
pulling your leg, old pal.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.505
Whoever's after me
ain't got nothing to do

09:06.546 --> 09:08.840
with my German comrades.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.718
Is that so?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.346
Well, I don't think
I can help you.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.432
I don't work for
the OSS anymore.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.977
Maybe you should go
to the po-lice,

09:20.018 --> 09:22.479
if you're really being targeted.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.231
No can do, Grims.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.567
Stripes don't look good on me.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.778
Maybe I'll just go to the press.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.615
Uh... uh, like, for instance,
I could tell 'em

09:33.657 --> 09:36.326
how you helped me disappear
30 years ago.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.705
About the countless war crimes
and murders I committed.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.000
How you whitewashed my files
so I could move

09:43.041 --> 09:45.294
to the good old U.S. of A.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.547
Uh, uh... I could implicate you

09:48.588 --> 09:51.216
just by coming clean.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.386
And I fear that may jeopardize
our friendship.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.347
You son of a bitch.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.225
You helped me disappear once.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.061
You'll help me disappear again.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.776
I know what von Braun said,

10:09.818 --> 10:12.529
but I can't find this
Colonel fuck anywhere.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.489
At least not according to
anything in the Ark.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.159
Maybe the files were burned
in the fire.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.036
What have you found
on Helen Hirsch,

10:19.077 --> 10:21.997
that-that survivor who was
killed at Simpson's barbecue?

10:22.039 --> 10:25.042
Well, I... in her obituary,
it says that she's from Arlav.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.836
I found four Nazi officers
that are from there,

10:27.878 --> 10:31.965
but none of them with aliases
leading to Biff Simpson.

10:32.007 --> 10:36.511
But my safta found
their immigration records.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.639
And all of them are signed
by the same guy:

10:39.681 --> 10:40.891
Carmel Offie.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.894
Offie?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.313
Mm. I know that name.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.777
I'll check with my office and
see what we can find on him.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.987
Where the hell you been?

10:54.029 --> 10:57.199
Checking with my contacts
in D.C. on Biff Simpson.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.533
He's still missing.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.577
It took you all night
to do that?

11:00.619 --> 11:02.454
- Rox, take it easy.
- What?

11:02.496 --> 11:05.332
She is still a Fed that could
bust all our asses.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.584
Now, what does it say
that she just up and left us

11:07.626 --> 11:09.628
for the better part
of the night?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.797
My mother is dying in a hospital

11:11.838 --> 11:13.590
halfway across town,
and I'm here with you,

11:13.632 --> 11:14.800
not where I'd rather be.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.137
That's what it fucking says
about me.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.432
Come on, Rox, let's take a walk.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.156
It feels wrong being here.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.826
Got any better ideas,
Nancy Drew?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.578
You said we need to find him.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.206
- Come on.
- All right.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.041
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.467
Looks just how he left it.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.605
What the hell?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.526
He told me he didn't
get in anywhere.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.320
This is Harvard.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.322
MIT. Stanford.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.991
Why didn't he tell me this?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.826
Didn't tell anyone.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.411
Didn't want his grandma
to find out

12:24.453 --> 12:27.038
and feel bad that
they couldn't afford it.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.499
He could have told me.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.210
Yeah, yeah, he could have
told you.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.673
Could have told me
a lot of things.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.388
Tell me again
what Jonah told you, in detail.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.515
Did he say where he was staying?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.267
Think, Cheeks, come on.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.685
I am thinking.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.229
It's a lot of pressure, okay?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.899
Fuck. I mean...

12:53.940 --> 12:56.485
he said something...

12:56.526 --> 12:58.612
mentioned some dude
named-named Meyer.

12:58.653 --> 13:03.450
But I don't really remember
his last name, so...

13:03.492 --> 13:04.784
Meyer.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.709
Meyer Offerman?

13:17.756 --> 13:20.300
Jonah, can I ask you something?

13:20.342 --> 13:23.136
What happened to von Braun
in California?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.598
Nothing.
We got our answers.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.974
We left him there.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.228
- Alive?
- Mm-hmm.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.902
Jonah, is that the truth?

13:38.944 --> 13:42.948
Isn't that what you need it
to be, Agent Morris?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.878
Or I could just call...

14:02.300 --> 14:03.677
Hey, Ron, it's Millie.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.596
Um, question:
does the name Carmel Offie

14:06.638 --> 14:08.014
mean anything to you?

14:08.056 --> 14:11.518
No. Why?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.769
Should it?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.729
I've seen that name somewhere.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.815
Can you go into Grimsby's
office and look around?

14:16.856 --> 14:20.777
No. Grimsby reported you
to Jenkins.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.487
He said you let
a murder suspect go

14:22.529 --> 14:23.947
without authorization.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.658
And that you procured a warrant
under false pretenses.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.201
Asked him
to pull your credentials.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.745
But that lying son of a bitch
told me that was the only way

14:30.787 --> 14:32.289
I could get the damn warrant.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.291
I know that
and you know that, but...

14:34.332 --> 14:35.972
who do you think
Jenkins is gonna believe?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.170
Okay.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.463
Where is Grimsby now?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.008
He hasn't been in the office
in two days.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.844
His secretary
said he called in sick.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.764
Mm, no. Grimsby hasn't taken
a sick day since I've known him.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.770
Fuck.

14:55.812 --> 14:56.938
I know who Offie is.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.946
If Harriet finds Schidler Corp.,
Meyer says we got to be ready.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.912

Anybody mess with me,
I'd kill the motherfucker.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.385

15:27.427 --> 15:30.555
Or so I thought. But...

15:30.597 --> 15:34.559
when I killed that Nazi
at Holstedder's,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.395
it didn't feel so fly.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.439
One moment she was alive,

15:39.481 --> 15:40.899

19:01.808 --> 19:04.102
- I-I don't need your help
with this...
- No.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.438
- This is my fight.
- This isn't charity, all right?

19:08.731 --> 19:11.109
It's a debt I owe.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.253
You're back.

19:30.295 --> 19:34.090
And Tobias is not.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.800

Yes.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.146
Why?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.732
Because I could.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.483
Because they were weak.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.447

it would take Tobias

19:57.488 --> 20:01.159

20:01.200 --> 20:03.077
Alexander and Lukas.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.205
Truth be told,

20:06.247 --> 20:10.460

he'd be standing here

who was dead.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.551
I practically raised those boys.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.512
Trained them.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.973
Taught them everything
they knew.

20:24.015 --> 20:27.393
Some things can't be taught.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.187

21:07.392 --> 21:09.227
First of many.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.478
Fingered Sarah Waterston

21:10.520 --> 21:13.314

down that street.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.501
Well, as much as I'm enjoying
this trip down memory lane,

21:15.525 --> 21:17.127
perhaps we should both
try playing the quiet game

21:17.151 --> 21:18.361

21:18.403 --> 21:21.698
Uh, can't stop now.
The best one's yet to come.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.493
- Kellogg Park.
Just over that hill.
- God...

21:25.535 --> 21:26.828
The place where
my father told me

21:26.869 --> 21:28.496
the only role I was born to play

21:28.538 --> 21:30.540
was nothing.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.626
Said it in Hebrew, too.
Shum-da-var.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.005
Guess he figured...
two languages

21:37.046 --> 21:38.923
would really
drive the point home.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.927
Sweet old Dad.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.764
Do you believe him?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.851

21:49.892 --> 21:51.436
when you believe
they're the truth.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, maybe they just sting
because he's an asshole.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.485
You are a lot of things, Lonny.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.405
"Nothing" is not one of them.

Anyway, enough therapy.
Eyes on the prize, yes?

22:09.787 --> 22:12.165
Security gates.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.000
Armed guards

22:14.042 --> 22:16.294
patrolling the lot,
the perimeter.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.380
Only one road in and out.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.300
This could be the place
where they're cooking the stuff.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.261
Oh, this is definitely
the place.

22:25.303 --> 22:28.139
That's the Aryan cockfuck
that shivved me.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.604
We need to gain access
to that building.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.272
How do you suggest we do that?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.358
Not how.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.029
Go ahead.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.157
Who.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.760

Who are you people?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.554

working for the Nazis.

talking about?

23:16.479 --> 23:18.064
Okay.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.484
So this, uh, this is how
this is gonna go down, Judas.

23:21.526 --> 23:22.860

23:35.706 --> 23:38.084
Now what do you do
for Schidler Corp.?

23:38.126 --> 23:40.086
- I'm the plant manager.
- Oh, perfect.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.504
Tell us everything you know

23:41.546 --> 23:44.423
about the warehouse,
about the pathogen,

23:44.465 --> 23:47.135
the layout,
the distribution routes.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.095

you know nothing,

child.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.891
Fuck you.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.852
Well, that's going to be
rather tricky

23:55.893 --> 23:57.478
with your nethers on fire, dear.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.948
Stop! Stop!

24:08.990 --> 24:10.032

24:22.211 --> 24:23.296
Mm.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.592
I'd probably speak up now.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.262
Never underestimate the power
of a blowtorch, friends.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.639
Nazi Ken upstairs
said our German friends

24:33.681 --> 24:36.184
are sending out their little
pathogen-filled treats

24:36.225 --> 24:38.311
around 8:00 p.m. tonight.
Nationwide.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.729
- Tonight?
- Yes.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.856
Trucks will depart
to supermarkets

24:41.898 --> 24:43.649
all over the Eastern seaboard.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.152
If we don't stop them,
then what that virus did

24:46.194 --> 24:47.987
to The Ghost could happen
to millions

24:48.029 --> 24:50.406

24:57.330 --> 25:00.416
the day of judgment has come.

25:00.458 --> 25:03.002
Lonny and I have ascertained
the layout of the factory

25:03.044 --> 25:07.048
and the location of the pathogen
from the Nazi swine upstairs.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.967
- Once we have infiltrated
the warehouse...
- Infiltrate?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.762
Why don't we just drop a bomb
on the place and call it a day?

25:12.803 --> 25:15.473
Because we don't have
that sort of firepower, Joe.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.267
Besides, there's no guarantee
that the liquid pathogen

25:18.309 --> 25:21.103
and the thousands
and thousands of boxes of food

25:21.145 --> 25:24.106
it has been pumped into
would all be destroyed.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.028
We need a brave soul
to get in there

25:29.070 --> 25:31.364
and burn it from the inside out,

25:31.405 --> 25:34.700
so that the Nazis can never
exact this plan again.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.789
- I'll do it.
- What? No, no, no.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.625
No, a child would attract
too much attention.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.836

there's guard gates...

25:45.878 --> 25:49.757

27:02.413 --> 27:04.040
We were told to keep quiet.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.583
We were told...

27:05.624 --> 27:08.919
we were protecting America
against the Soviets!

27:08.961 --> 27:10.588
Sometimes you have
to look the other way

27:10.629 --> 27:12.131
for the greater good.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.692
The greater good?
Does that include sending me

27:13.716 --> 27:15.277
down the wrong path
in this investigation?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.219
Or when you had me
nearly beaten to death?

27:17.261 --> 27:19.281
- I was trying to protect you!
- Or how your actions

27:19.305 --> 27:22.600
-led to a fucking
Fourth Reich plot in America!
-There is no

27:22.641 --> 27:24.411
Fourth Reich plot;
that's just a bullshit story

27:24.435 --> 27:26.854
- concocted by Meyer Offerman!
- Who told you that?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.832
Your little Nazi friend, huh?
Hey! Look, motherfucker,

27:28.856 --> 27:31.043
you take one more step, you're
walking out of here with a limp.

27:31.067 --> 27:34.320
- Millie.
- Now, I want you to tell me

27:34.362 --> 27:36.614
everything you know about
the Fourth Reich.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.032
And speak into the mic.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.785
Seriously, ma'am,
he's telling the truth.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.078
I don't know nothing...

27:42.119 --> 27:44.830
I know about Schidler Corp.
I know about New Jersey.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.458
And I'm pretty fucking sure
you know exactly where

27:47.500 --> 27:49.960
that pathogen is going out
and you know when.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.879
So start talking.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.089
I can't, really.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.424
I don't know a thing...

27:58.552 --> 28:02.098
Ow!

28:02.139 --> 28:04.934
Ooh!

28:04.975 --> 28:06.435
You want to try again?

28:06.477 --> 28:08.521
Please, don't shoot!

28:08.562 --> 28:10.898
I'll tell you everything.
Everything!

28:10.940 --> 28:13.859
But... you'll still be too late!

28:13.901 --> 28:15.861
- We'll see about that.
- You're coming with me.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.530
You.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.965
Chain yourself
to the fucking railing.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.991
Do it now.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.624
Go.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.043
Millie, don't leave me here.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.212
You can't trust him!

28:33.254 --> 28:35.232
He was called the Butcher
of Arlav, for Christ's sake!

28:35.256 --> 28:37.633
I trust him more
than I trust you.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.138
721, 721...

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
Suck me sideways.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.267
- Nice neighborhood?
- Goddamn.

28:48.269 --> 28:51.439
- This should be it.
- Shit.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.774
You hear that?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.947
What the fuck?

29:02.741 --> 29:03.951
Jonah!

29:13.252 --> 29:14.712
What the fuck?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.344
Jonah!

29:22.386 --> 29:24.889
Fuck. What do we do now?

29:24.930 --> 29:26.849
Maybe we should go to the cops.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.642
- What?
- Well, did you just
see that shit?

29:28.684 --> 29:30.478
He's got to be
in some kind of trouble.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.104
What if he gets hurt?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.440
And you think some
white oinkers gonna help us?

29:34.482 --> 29:36.293
-"Hello, Officers.
Uh, don't want to get...
-Stop.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.670
"in the way of your racism,
but could you help us Negroes

29:38.694 --> 29:40.821
possibly stop a Nazi plot?"

29:40.863 --> 29:43.532
Man, they'd lock our ass up
and throw us in the loony bin

29:43.574 --> 29:45.135
- and you know this.
- Look, when Booty got killed,

29:45.159 --> 29:46.911
there was a cop that helped us.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.079
A brother. He cared about Jonah.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.664
Fuck. I don't know, Carol.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.666
It doesn't seem
like a good idea.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.293
I'm not gonna not do anything.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.253
Taxi!

29:56.295 --> 29:59.256
So unless the fucking Batmobile
is gonna come pick us up

29:59.298 --> 30:01.884
to go follow Jonah,
it's our only option.

30:01.926 --> 30:04.553
Saddle up, motherfucker.
Okay? Come on.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.436
It's just

30:12.478 --> 30:14.021
a flesh wound.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.648
Quit crying like a little girl.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.399
It fucking hurts!

30:17.441 --> 30:20.236
Oh, really? Boo-fucking-hoo.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.239
German, huh?
Finally dropping the act?

30:23.280 --> 30:26.534
Take it. Don't fuck up
my upholstery.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.537
Something tells me you deserve a
lot more after what you've done,

30:29.578 --> 30:31.372
killing thousands
during the war,

30:31.413 --> 30:33.415
killing your entire family
in broad daylight,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.251
blaming it on a black man.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.211
Not like it was hard.

30:37.253 --> 30:41.215
You Americans wax poetic
about your immigration,

30:41.257 --> 30:43.884
your equal rights,
your Statue of Liberty,

30:43.926 --> 30:47.763
your tired, poor, pathetic
masses yearning to be free.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.348
And that torch?

30:49.390 --> 30:52.351
Might as well shove it
straight up Liberty's ass.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.144
- Hmm.
- 'Cause at the end of the day,

30:54.186 --> 30:58.357
Americans are just as racist
as the rest of us.

30:58.399 --> 31:02.069
Well, maybe not you.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.655
Why you think I done

31:04.697 --> 31:06.740
so good in Washington?

31:06.782 --> 31:10.536
Highest-ranking Nazi
in the American government.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.204
Then what happened?

31:12.246 --> 31:13.622
The pressure get to be too much?

31:13.664 --> 31:15.624
Is that why you killed
your whole family?

31:15.666 --> 31:18.961
'Cause a Jewish survivor
blew your cover?

31:19.003 --> 31:21.797
I got to say, for you
to reach out to Grimsby,

31:21.839 --> 31:24.341
things must not have been
going too good for you.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.885
It's not like you Nazis
operate by any kind

31:26.927 --> 31:30.139
of moral code, either, so for
you to have pissed them off,

31:30.180 --> 31:32.558
you must have really
messed things up.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.394
This is why
we'll always beat you.

31:35.436 --> 31:38.522
Y'all play by the rules.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.190
We don't.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.192
Well, then, I don't suppose
you want to tell me

31:42.234 --> 31:43.819
the real identity
of The Colonel.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.196
Beat her at her own game.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.658
Nice try.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.545
I like you.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.382
- Uh, Millie, is it?
- Sit back.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.385
You got spunk, Millie.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.596
Huevos negros.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.389
Could've made a great comrade

32:12.431 --> 32:14.642
if you wasn't
a porch monkey and all.

32:14.683 --> 32:17.561
Oh, damn, I was really hoping
I could join that club.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.438
Seriously, though.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.273
Don't know how you do it.

32:21.315 --> 32:24.026
Wearing that skin every day,

32:24.068 --> 32:26.862
people thinking
you're the scum of the earth,

32:26.904 --> 32:30.658
getting paid, what, a dime
to the white man's dollar?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.660
- Hmm.
- Must be a bitch.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.287
Yeah, it certainly is.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.039
But I'd still rather
be standing where I am

32:37.081 --> 32:39.041
than sitting where you are.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.460
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

32:41.502 --> 32:45.881
It's like you said,
y'all don't play by the rules.

32:45.923 --> 32:49.635
So it's got to be scary as shit
to be a cowboy Nazi

32:49.677 --> 32:52.596
with a bull's-eye on his back.

32:53.806 --> 32:56.892
Blut und Boden.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.062
Blood and soil.

33:00.104 --> 33:03.315
As the world grotesquely marches

33:03.357 --> 33:08.529
toward a homogenous society
of half-breeds,

33:08.570 --> 33:12.950
we alone remain pure of blood.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.912
We alone remain committed

33:16.954 --> 33:21.417
to the Fuhrer's glorious vision
of the future.

33:21.458 --> 33:25.546
But despite our efforts,

33:25.587 --> 33:31.468
our enemy has ousted us
from our homeland.

33:31.510 --> 33:36.974
And now we will oust them
from theirs.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.059
Because we...

33:39.101 --> 33:42.896
we are not like the Jew,

33:42.938 --> 33:48.110
weak and begging,
who walked the desert...

33:49.987 --> 33:52.573
in mindless circles
for a generation.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.953
Our exile has come to an end.

34:01.749 --> 34:06.211
We will purge this country
of the filth that inhabits it

34:06.253 --> 34:10.048
and begin again...

34:10.090 --> 34:12.134
with a new regime,

34:12.176 --> 34:14.553
a Fourth Reich.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.861

We need to hurry.

36:47.664 --> 36:50.542
Once Lonny gets

we have approximately

four minutes for the substance
to reach 500 degrees.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.847
Joe and Jonah, you're up.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.158
You've got two guards
on your six

37:05.182 --> 37:06.892
patrolling the lot
at alternating

Guards on your 12 every 45...

Yeah, I got it, I got it.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.566
Go.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.778
It's too small
with this fucking pack on.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.261
Maybe I can push it
in front of me.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.503
Take your belt off and strap
the backpack to your ankle.

37:52.396 --> 37:55.023
Attach the bombs and get
the fuck out of there.

Tell me you're gonna
get that Colonel bitch?

38:23.051 --> 38:25.637
You know, death is inevitable
for all of us.

38:25.679 --> 38:29.016
She will just meet hers
a little sooner than planned.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.271
What?

38:34.312 --> 38:37.232
I, um...

38:37.274 --> 38:39.443

If you hadn't come along for me

don't know what would've
happened to us.

All right. Turn right.

39:17.064 --> 39:20.358
30 feet in front of you, there
is a metal door. Do you see it?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.361
Yep. Moving there now.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.613
Good.

39:46.093 --> 39:48.386
Okay.

39:48.428 --> 39:51.431
Fuck. Okay.

39:51.473 --> 39:54.267
I can't do this. I g... I got
to get the fuck out of here.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.852
Lonny... bloody hell.
Lonny, calm down.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.521
Just breathe. Breathe?

39:57.562 --> 39:59.731
I'm in a warehouse
with a hundred Nazis hell-bent

39:59.773 --> 40:02.567
on killing me. I'm not sure my
breathing's gonna change that.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.489
- Maybe my father was right.
- Oh?

40:07.531 --> 40:11.076
And was he right when a
22-year-old Leonard Flazenstein

40:11.118 --> 40:14.287
went out on his own, leaving
that armpit of New Jersey

40:14.329 --> 40:16.248
to star in a Broadway show?

40:16.289 --> 40:18.416
Was he, was he right
when you won a Tony Award

40:18.458 --> 40:19.751
straight out of the gate?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.753
Yeah. Look at me now.

40:21.795 --> 40:24.756
I've been bested
by Hoffman and Dreyfuss.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.342
I can't even get
an Ed Wood film.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.344
Uh, he was right.

40:29.386 --> 40:31.429
Lonny Flash is not the man.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.975
He's fucking pathetic.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.894
Lonny Flash is not walking
into that factory,

40:37.936 --> 40:39.646
Leonard Flazenstein is.

40:39.688 --> 40:43.066
A brave young kid who defied
his father's expectations.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.777
So forget your father,
the way that you did

40:45.819 --> 40:47.445
20-odd years ago.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.698
Forgetting my father
may take a few more sessions

40:49.739 --> 40:52.909
- with Dr. Rosenstein.
- Lonny, please.

40:52.951 --> 40:57.080
I didn't know your wanker
of a father, but I do know this:

40:57.122 --> 41:00.750
he may have been disappointed
in your last role,

41:00.792 --> 41:04.546
but he sure as hell won't be
disappointed in this one.

41:04.588 --> 41:08.133
So get in there and save
the motherfucking day.
