00:23.690 --> 00:25.351
Hi.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.121
Valerie, it's been
two damn weeks.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.457
What the hell is going on?

00:28.495 --> 00:31.089
I thought you said you were
going to get me out of here.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.496
Look, I'm trying, okay?

00:32.531 --> 00:34.591
But I don't have $100,000
laying around

00:34.634 --> 00:36.295
to give to Mr. Bail Bondsman.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.566
And since I don't have
any hard assets,

00:38.605 --> 00:40.197
we've got a problem.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.366
What about the club?

00:41.408 --> 00:42.932
There's got to be
equity in the club.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.944
I don't own the building.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.003
I just have the business.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.174
And as far as the bondsmen
are concerned,

00:49.215 --> 00:51.012
night clubs are fly-by-night.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.847
What happened
with your family?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.252
They already have a second
mortgage on their house.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.916
Not that my stepfather
was willing, anyway.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.825
I'm sorry.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.057
Do you have any idea what kind
of hell I'm living through?

01:05.098 --> 01:07.191
Look, I have
a business appraiser

01:07.233 --> 01:09.531
looking over the books
and the inventory, okay?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.969
He says he'll work
with me on the numbers,

01:12.005 --> 01:14.064
but you're gonna have
to hold out a little longer.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.802
I can't hold out
a little longer.

01:15.842 --> 01:18.310
I'm not gonna make it in here,
you hear me?

01:18.344 --> 01:19.743
I'm not gonna make it.

01:19.779 --> 01:23.943
Look, I'll have an answer
later this afternoon, okay?

01:23.983 --> 01:25.507
Don't worry.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.043
Everything's going to be okay.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.091
You're all I've got.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.660
Get me out.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.489
Thanks.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.827
That's not very nice.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.492
So, you're not going to
show us your scars, huh?

03:54.534 --> 03:56.798
No. There are no scars.

03:56.836 --> 03:57.894
Trust me. I checked.

03:57.937 --> 03:58.995
It was catheter surgery.

03:59.105 --> 04:00.504
All I have is a
small little mark

04:00.540 --> 04:01.666
on my leg.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.039
You know,
when my uncle got a pacemaker,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.135
you could, like, feel
it under his skin,

04:05.178 --> 04:07.373
like a cigarette
lighter or something.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.937
Not any more.
They're so small now,

04:08.982 --> 04:10.540
you wouldn't even know
it was there.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.914
Here.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.578
You feel anything?

04:13.620 --> 04:14.882
- Uh-uh.
- It's amazing, huh?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.081
Mm-hmm.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.281
Well, all I know...
it's gonna

04:17.322 --> 04:18.688
be nice to have you
play again next season.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.692
Yeah, thanks.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.851
They've already given me

04:20.892 --> 04:21.951
the green light
to go back into training.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.256
Of course, the doctor's got me

04:23.296 --> 04:24.422
on a pretty tight leash.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.329
Not to mention Donna.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.129
Damn straight. Let's go.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.964
- All right. See you later.
- Bye, guys.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.401
- See you, guys.
- See you.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.802
- Bye.
- I got to go, too.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.204
Kelly's coming home
today, so...

04:34.240 --> 04:35.605
I'm just glad she went in.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.973
I'm glad she stayed in.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.272
Yeah, well, I'm just glad.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.801
- Do you have my wallet?
- No.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.972
Hey, isn't that, um,

04:41.080 --> 04:43.173
Joan, that woman you tried
to set up with Nat?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.683
Yeah, it is.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.548
Yeah, Willie said they've
been seeing each other.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.712
Hey, everybody.

04:47.754 --> 04:48.914
Steve, how are you?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.149
- Hey, Joan.
- Mmm.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.588
Good to see you. I'm glad to see

04:51.624 --> 04:52.784
things are going so well.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.090
Yeah, it's really
been good to see Nat.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.797
You guys have a good day.

04:58.831 --> 04:59.957
Bye.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.432
- Bye.
- See you.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.593
See you later, Joanie.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.765
Bye, Nat.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.740
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

05:08.775 --> 05:10.470
Uh, uh, nothing.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.603
It... just didn't work out.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.907
You're kidding.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.379
Yeah, you guys looked
so happy together.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.939
That's the way it goes.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.245
- Well, what happened?
- What happened?

05:19.285 --> 05:23.051
We went out a few times,
and, uh...

05:23.089 --> 05:25.649
I don't know,
the magic just wasn't there.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.455
It's not like in the old days.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.585
What are you talking about?

05:28.628 --> 05:29.595
I don't know.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.722
I can't put my finger on it.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.459
You guys want something else?

05:33.499 --> 05:34.625
Uh-uh.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.793
All right, good.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.961
- See you.
- Hmm.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.834
Well, we can't say
we didn't try.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.133
We should do something.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.435
We should leave it alone.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.032
Aah!

05:45.878 --> 05:48.574
You think
I'll get another roommate?

05:48.614 --> 05:50.980
This place looks so empty
all of a sudden.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.110
Maybe you'll get the
room all for yourself.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.482
Hey, you only have
one week left.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.956
Just stick with it.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.822
- You gonna visit me?
- I will be

06:00.860 --> 06:02.054
here for out-patient.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.289
You'll see me
almost every night at group.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.796
It's not the same thing.

06:04.831 --> 06:05.923
Tara,

06:06.032 --> 06:07.556
you'll be fine.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.531
Got everything?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.061
I think so.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.971
Oh, wait.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.875
Oh, um, no.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.037
No, really, I wanted
you to keep that.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.546
Really?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.048
Yeah.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.108
I was hoping you'd say that.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.912
Come in.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.183
You ready to go?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.214
What are you doing
here? I thought

06:32.258 --> 06:33.384
they sent you off
to Pediatrics?

06:33.426 --> 06:35.257
I just wanted to stop by
and wish you good luck.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.420
Well, thank you.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.895
- So, you got a ride?
- Uh, yeah.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.194
My mom and my brother
are meeting me in the lobby.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.700
- Okay, then, you're all set?
- All set.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.395
Great. Come on,
I'll take these for you.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.960
Oh, thanks.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.369
Hang on one second.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.533
Come here.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.539
- Mmm. I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.067
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.103
I'll see you, okay?

06:56.682 --> 06:58.206
So, what do you got planned?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.980
Uh, mostly catching
up on my classes.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.418
I figure if I keep
myself busy with that,

07:02.455 --> 07:04.514
I won't have to think
about anything else.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.616
I'm no expert,
but from what I've observed,

07:06.659 --> 07:07.921
you've come a long way.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.587
You think so?

07:09.629 --> 07:11.529
I do. So don't let
life throw you.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.930
Thanks, Doc.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.661
Almost a doctor.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.373
Oh, great. There she is.

07:26.412 --> 07:27.936
Now, just let me handle this.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.505
You know what? I feel
totally weird about this.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.814
We're completely butting
in on Nat's life.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.945
Come on, Clare.
Where's your sense of romance?

07:35.054 --> 07:37.614
Besides which, would you rather
have Brandon and Steve do it?

07:37.657 --> 07:38.954
Point taken.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.620
Hi.

07:42.662 --> 07:43.959
Susan, Clare.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.462
- Hi.
- What a surprise.

07:45.498 --> 07:46.965
Can I help you with something?

07:47.066 --> 07:48.897
Um, I need a new desk lamp,

07:48.935 --> 07:50.493
and Nat said
that you worked here,

07:50.536 --> 07:52.970
so I thought I'd come by
and give you the business.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.835
Great. What did you have
in mind?

07:54.874 --> 07:55.966
Craftsman?

07:56.042 --> 07:58.169
Victorian?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.644
Contemporary?

08:01.781 --> 08:05.182
Uh... how about something
romantic and nostalgic?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.186
Come on, I'll show you
what we have.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.057
What the heck does a
romantic desk lamp look like?

08:12.091 --> 08:13.353
Not a word.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.423
Here they are.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.158
Take your pick.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.530
Great.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.535
Um...

08:23.569 --> 08:26.129
Listen, Joan, um...

08:26.172 --> 08:28.504
I hate to pry,

08:28.541 --> 08:31.510
but I, I just have
to say something, um...

08:31.544 --> 08:34.138
Nat hasn't been the same
since you left this morning.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.374
Are you kidding?

08:35.414 --> 08:37.109
What? You know it's true.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.640
I mean, did you guys have
a fight or something?

08:39.684 --> 08:41.676
You don't have
to answer that, really.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.948
It's none of our business.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.181
Sure it is.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.157
You care about Nat.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.353
Well, we kind of thought
you did, too.

08:48.394 --> 08:49.588
I do. I really do.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.653
What's the problem then?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.493
Not-Not that

08:52.532 --> 08:54.693
you have to answer
that, actually...

08:54.734 --> 08:56.531
I-I really can't
put my finger on it.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.730
Funny. That's, uh...

08:58.771 --> 09:01.001
that's exactly what Nat said.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.907
You...
you talked to Nat about me?

09:03.976 --> 09:05.568
Yeah.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.909
What did Nat say?

09:08.014 --> 09:10.346
Something about the magic

09:10.383 --> 09:12.317
that the two of you
used to have.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.842
Everything with Nat was magic.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.411
No matter what we did,

09:16.455 --> 09:18.548
even if it was just going
for a hot dog,

09:18.591 --> 09:20.218
he'd make it romantic.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.086
But that was then,
and this is now.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.066
Oh, so you're saying you don't
think Nat's romantic anymore?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.068
Oh, I'm sure
he is. It's just

09:30.102 --> 09:33.936
that maybe it's the time,
the place.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.941
You can't repeat the past.

09:37.009 --> 09:40.240
So, did you pick out a lamp?

09:40.279 --> 09:41.610
Oh...

09:41.647 --> 09:43.376
She doesn't really
need a lamp.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.043
I kind of figured that.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.042
Give my best to Nat.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.853
You're good friends.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.517
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.287
Well, that was successful.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.796
She's crazy about him.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.798
Yeah, and he's
crazy about her,

09:59.832 --> 10:01.891
but there's nothing
we can do about it.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.700
I, uh, had a chance
to catch some tape

10:11.744 --> 10:14.406
on your boyfriend's
prime-time road rally

10:14.447 --> 10:16.438
with the L.A.P.D.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.218
I, uh, managed to miss

10:23.255 --> 10:24.415
the first showing.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.957
You sure you want
to go through with this?

10:27.994 --> 10:29.120
Yes,

10:29.161 --> 10:31.857
but without the lecture, please.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.422
Well, seems like you managed

10:34.467 --> 10:36.662
to certify the equity
in your club.

10:36.702 --> 10:39.170
Now all I need
is a cashier's check

10:39.205 --> 10:40.763
in the amount of $10,000.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.001
Here you go.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.203
Sweet.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.712
Let's just hope

10:47.747 --> 10:50.147
your boyfriend doesn't get
a hankering to see the world.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.015
Well, that wouldn't be
in our best interest.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.984
No, it wouldn't.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.460
Clare, uh, do you think
we should change the music...

11:05.498 --> 11:06.931
I don't know,

11:06.966 --> 11:09.264
something maybe a little
more soothing or something?

11:09.301 --> 11:10.791
No. Normal is better.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.928
We don't want to treat her
any different

11:11.971 --> 11:12.960
than we did before, right?

11:13.039 --> 11:16.600
- Right.
- Anybody home?

11:16.642 --> 11:18.439
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:18.477 --> 11:19.842
- Welcome home!
- Thank you.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.540
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.445
Uh, Kel, I'm just gonna put
your stuff in your room.

11:23.482 --> 11:24.642
- Thanks.
- My God.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.447
Look at these,
they're gorgeous!

11:26.485 --> 11:28.715
They're from Brandon,
Susan and Steve.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.221
They wanted to be here,

11:30.256 --> 11:32.087
but they thought you might feel
a little overwhelmed.

11:32.124 --> 11:33.557
- Aw...
- They're beautiful.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.992
Hey, wait till you see
your room.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.929
- All right, lead the way.
- Come on.

11:44.403 --> 11:47.270
Wait a second, wait.
Where's Colin's painting?

11:47.306 --> 11:50.469
Uh, we took it down.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.999
- Why?
- Well, we didn't think

11:52.078 --> 11:54.273
that was the first thing you'd
want to see when you got home.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.845
Let me do my own redecorating,
all right?

11:57.883 --> 12:00.443
Sorry.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.819
What is this?

12:05.858 --> 12:08.588
It's a little
homecoming present.

12:08.627 --> 12:11.187
I thought you might like having
something to take care of.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.289
David, they're so cool.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.129
I haven't had fish
since I was a kid.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.135
Uh, here. Feed them.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.399
They haven't eaten all day.

12:19.438 --> 12:20.871
Just don't give them too much.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.272
Now, you know, fish
will eat until they die.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.571
I know. You know what?

12:24.610 --> 12:27.272
I'm going to name
the big orange one David.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.911
There you go, guys.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.851
So, have you, uh,
heard anything

12:33.886 --> 12:36.787
about Colin?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.790
Yeah, he's a jailbird.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.314
He can't make bail.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.390
Kelly, he's going to have
to do some time.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.298
I just don't think
you should be so hard on him.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.566
He's been humbled enough.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.197
You just worry
about yourself, okay?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.231
That's all I care about.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.335
You want me to get that?

12:59.378 --> 13:01.005
No, it's probably Tara.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.809
She said she would call.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.941
Hello?

13:05.050 --> 13:07.041
Hey, Tara, can you hold on?

13:07.086 --> 13:09.884
Um, can you just tell
everybody I need to rest?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.082
Sure.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.147
You okay?

13:12.191 --> 13:13.749
Yeah, it's good to be home.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.387
Thank you.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.861
You're welcome.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.956
Hi.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.401
Hey. What's going on?

13:26.438 --> 13:28.372
Uh, Tara called.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.806
That was quick.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.104
Kelly seemed pretty upset.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.474
No, she's fine.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.706
She just needs to get used
to everything again.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.944
Yeah, I think she just needs
a night in her own bed.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.644
She'll be fine in the morning.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.150
Hello?

13:47.193 --> 13:48.990
I heard you were coming out
of rehab today.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.325
That's great.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.590
Colin...

13:51.630 --> 13:53.564
Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted
to welcome you home,

13:53.599 --> 13:55.692
tell you
I was thinking about you.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.168
Um... Where are you?

14:00.206 --> 14:02.367
Where do you think?

14:02.408 --> 14:04.535
But I'm getting out of here
tonight.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.044
I'm glad for you.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.045
Thanks.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.513
I'd love to see you.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.641
No. I...

14:11.684 --> 14:13.515
I have to go.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.240
Is there a Ms. Malone here?

14:42.281 --> 14:44.442
Uh, yeah...

14:44.483 --> 14:45.472
- Yeah.
- Great.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.779
That's me.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.650
I'm Tony Spencer,
Mr. Roberts' lawyer.

14:48.687 --> 14:49.915
- He made bail.
- Robbins.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.286
His name is Colin Robbins.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.190
I'm sorry. Robbins.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.454
Look, he'll be out
within the hour, okay?

14:55.494 --> 14:57.189
Well, wait.
So what's next?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.696
We try and plead
the charges down.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.698
Plead down?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.165
What do you mean plead down?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.758
Are you saying
that we don't have a defense?

15:02.801 --> 15:04.701
That we have to take
whatever deal they give us?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.797
Ms. Malone,
I'm a public defender.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.809
Thirty cases found their way
on to my desk this morning.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.743
Now, I do the best
I can do,

15:12.778 --> 15:14.746
the way I see fit to do it.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.180
Now, if you want to pay
for the high-priced spread,

15:17.216 --> 15:18.547
I can give you a referral.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.576
Okay, so let's say
we take the plea.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.713
What's the best you can do?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.053
Well, we're looking
at possession,

15:25.090 --> 15:27.684
resisting arrest,
and driving recklessly

15:27.726 --> 15:28.920
while trying to evade
a police officer.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.292
He's looking at least
three years

15:30.329 --> 15:31.626
in the state penitentiary.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.858
Three years?

15:32.898 --> 15:35.059
If I'm lucky,
I can get it down a year.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.328
Well, that's unacceptable.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.233
Best I can do.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.568
Look, after he gets
settled in tomorrow,

15:40.606 --> 15:41.868
have him give me a call.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.122
I'm home.

16:06.265 --> 16:09.530
Oh, man, it's going
to take a week

16:09.568 --> 16:11.468
just to get the stink
off of me.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.494
It's not that bad.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.166
Yeah, right.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.870
I just need to shower
and hit the sack.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.469
Well, you're out now.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.945
Yeah, for how long?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.676
From what I heard in there,

16:23.716 --> 16:27.117
the place I'll probably
get sent to...

16:27.152 --> 16:29.347
Well, I don't even want to think
about it.

16:29.388 --> 16:30.650
Well, the first thing
you need to think about

16:30.689 --> 16:31.951
is getting another lawyer.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.524
That Spencer's a loser.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.288
How do you suppose I pay
a good lawyer?

16:35.327 --> 16:36.988
I don't have a cent, Valerie.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.754
You're not paying him...

16:39.798 --> 16:41.390
I am.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.347
I wonder what it was, you know.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.876
I mean, I wonder
why they broke up.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.223
I mean, you know...

17:06.258 --> 17:09.921
to be apart after all these
years, you know, I mean,

17:09.962 --> 17:13.728
it-it must've been
meant to be.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.858
I just can't quite
figure out why,

17:15.901 --> 17:17.425
why they're apart now.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.869
Maybe she didn't know
when to be quiet.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.896
I'm sorry.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.909
I just can't seem
to get my mind off them...

17:24.943 --> 17:27.912
Just give it a rest, Keats.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.253
I guess you just get bored
after a while, huh?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.416
Bored?

17:39.458 --> 17:41.517
With you?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.222
Never.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.959
I'm not talking about us.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.796
I'm talking about
Nat and Joan.

17:50.969 --> 17:55.065
Well, maybe they had
their time and it's gone.

17:55.107 --> 17:59.601
You think passion
can't sustain itself?

18:01.847 --> 18:03.542
It's pretty simple.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.148
A rose untended is gonna wilt.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.679
Chocolate left out,
it's gonna go stale.

18:11.723 --> 18:14.317
Champagne uncorked,
it's gonna go flat.

18:14.359 --> 18:17.328
You kind of understand
what I'm saying?

18:17.362 --> 18:18.920
Mm-hmm.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.931
Yeah, I get it.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.127
So, um...

18:24.169 --> 18:28.196
how do you keep romance going?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.936
Do what I do.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.649
What? What? What?

18:39.685 --> 18:41.084
I'm sorry.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.089
Look, we have to do something.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.715
And when exactly was it

18:45.757 --> 18:48.089
that you got this
matchmaking obsession, huh?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.822
Look, I just feel bad.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.228
I mean, look at the two of them.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.232
Nat's been alone
for years and years.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.494
She's divorced

18:55.534 --> 18:57.764
and all her kids
have moved away.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.067
They're perfect for each other,
you know?

19:00.105 --> 19:03.097
Besides which, everybody needs
somebody.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.404
Come on, we have to help.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.707
And what exactly are
we supposed to do?

19:06.745 --> 19:09.043
We're talking about two
fully grown adults here.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.912
If they want to be together,
they'll be together.

19:10.949 --> 19:12.644
You can't take them
on a double date

19:12.684 --> 19:14.208
and throw them in the back seat

19:14.253 --> 19:15.618
and hope they fall in love,

19:15.654 --> 19:16.916
it ain't gonna happen.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.583
No, no, no,
that's a really good idea.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.058
Not a double date,
a triple date.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.117
Me, you...

19:22.161 --> 19:23.389
Clare, Steve and them.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.794
And what exactly is
that going to accomplish?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.093
Well, you know, you heard her.

19:27.132 --> 19:28.929
They just need
to have some fun, you know?

19:29.034 --> 19:30.934
Put romance back into it.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.563
And hanging out with us
is gonna do that?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.163
Honey... who better?

19:35.207 --> 19:37.198
Oh...

19:44.917 --> 19:46.544
Mom? What are you doing here?

19:46.585 --> 19:48.849
Good morning, darling.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.878
I went a little overboard
at Chez Panache this morning.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.686
I thought you could use
something special.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.750
That's very nice of you,
but you didn't have to.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.489
I know, I'm a mother.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.723
It's allowed.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.959
I won't argue that.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.658
Donna, coffee's on!

20:02.701 --> 20:04.965
So, how was it to spend
your first night at home?

20:05.070 --> 20:06.901
It was heaven.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.464
My sheets, my bed,
my pillows, everything...

20:09.508 --> 20:11.567
it was heaven.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.770
Here.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.575
Oh, it's
so sweet of you, Mom.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.548
I'm glad you came by.

20:19.985 --> 20:20.952
That's Joe.

20:20.986 --> 20:22.214
I'm late. I know.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.846
All right. Hello?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.288
You won't believe
what we had

20:25.324 --> 20:26.791
for breakfast again
this morning.

20:26.825 --> 20:27.985
Um...

20:28.026 --> 20:30.927
Lumpy oatmeal, cold toast
and warm juice.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.557
I feel like I'm going to heave.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.861
You'll be fine, Tara.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.333
Just go along with the program.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.801
And I will sneak
something yummy in

20:37.836 --> 20:39.133
before group tomorrow.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.536
All right.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.006
I-I just miss you.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.134
I'm sorry,
I keep calling so much.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.270
You can call as much
as you need to.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.473
Thanks, Kelly.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.004
Bye.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.811
Bye.

20:52.851 --> 20:55.217
That was Tara again?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.448
Yeah.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.353
How many times has
she called this morning?

20:58.390 --> 21:01.154
I don't know, Donna.
I haven't been counting.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.730
So, are you going
to school today?

21:05.764 --> 21:09.996
No, I think I need
another mental health day.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.262
I'm so far behind now,

21:13.305 --> 21:14.567
I'm just probably
going to end up

21:14.606 --> 21:15.971
with a bunch
of incompletes anyway.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.338
I'm going to go back to bed.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.145
I'll be right back.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.347
Kel, look, I'm sorry.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.516
I didn't mean anything
about Tara calling.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.457
I know.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.926
You just really have
to understand

21:35.961 --> 21:38.691
how hard it is
on her right now.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.755
I mean, she really relied
on me in there.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.825
And I'm like the only
person that she has.

21:43.869 --> 21:47.464
Well, she's lucky
to have you as a friend.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.373
Thanks, Donna.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.140
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.754
So I talked to Brenda
today...

22:02.788 --> 22:04.153
She's spending all
that time...

22:04.189 --> 22:05.656
- Hello!
- Hey, baby.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.659
- How you doing?
- Hi.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.160
Okay, it's all set
for tonight.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.320
- What is?
- With Joan.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.556
We talked to her.
She's on.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.961
- Triple date. Tonight.
- Oh, great.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.362
Where do we take 'em?

22:14.399 --> 22:15.593
Well, I've been thinking
about this.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.499
- I can vouch for that.
- Coffee, please.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.165
Now, Joan said the reason
that she broke it off with Nat

22:22.207 --> 22:23.401
was because and I quote:

22:23.442 --> 22:25.342
"You can't recapture
the past."

22:25.377 --> 22:28.278
I say we try.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.746
Well, that sounds
complicated.

22:29.781 --> 22:30.975
- Mm-hmm.
- No, no,

22:31.016 --> 22:32.608
you just have to use your
imagination, Steve.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.642
I mean, I'm talking
about a date

22:34.686 --> 22:36.210
that takes them back
into their past,

22:36.254 --> 22:39.382
you know, to their, uh,
favorite romantic haunts,

22:39.424 --> 22:41.085
you know, where
they first dated,

22:41.126 --> 22:42.821
and kissed and made love.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.123
That sounds all
well and good,

22:44.162 --> 22:45.686
but those places
don't exist anymore.

22:45.731 --> 22:46.823
Well, some do.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.230
I can guarantee
that even if they don't,

22:48.266 --> 22:49.460
I mean, their memories still do.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.525
Think back,

22:50.569 --> 22:52.503
1971.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.005
That would be the age
of disco inferno, right?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.007
Seldom right

22:56.108 --> 22:57.336
and wrong again, Steve,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.004
that would be pre-disco,
pre- Star Wars.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.104
Pre... Charlie's Angels.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.774
Okay, Joan told us
all the places

23:03.815 --> 23:05.442
they used to like to go.

23:05.484 --> 23:09.147
So, we just have one problem.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.712
And that's where you guys
come in.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.064
- Absolutely not! Forget it!
- Whoa,

23:20.098 --> 23:22.066
whoa, what're you getting
so bent out of shape about?

23:22.100 --> 23:23.567
It's not like this
is a shotgun wedding.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.297
Nat, it's one date,
man, one date.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.361
One date. Come on, now.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.531
Forget it, forget it.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.869
You can't make
something happen

23:28.907 --> 23:30.534
that's not supposed to happen.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.202
- See that's it?
- That is not it.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.541
- Is that it, Nat?
- That's it.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.806
Oh, boy, we are dead meat.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.814
Dead meat, my friend.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.475
Don't take it so hard, Brando.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.609
Put that away.

23:39.651 --> 23:40.640
- It's not your problem.
- No,

23:40.685 --> 23:41.982
see that's where you're wrong,

23:42.053 --> 23:43.680
that's where you're wrong
because this is my problem,

23:43.722 --> 23:45.553
it's my problem
and it's a very big one.

23:45.590 --> 23:46.989
It is?

23:47.092 --> 23:48.218
It is.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.922
Sanders, do you want
to be the one to explain

23:50.962 --> 23:52.759
to Susan and Clare that
their brilliant little idea

23:52.798 --> 23:54.288
isn't gonna fly, huh?

23:54.332 --> 23:58.826
Are you familiar with the term
"nihilus testiculus," huh?

23:58.870 --> 24:00.861
You got to reconsider.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.931
Please, the girls are gonna
give us so much grief.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.534
Oh, so, uh,
Clare and Susan

24:05.577 --> 24:06.874
conjured up this
whole scheme?

24:06.912 --> 24:08.174
Yes, yes, they conjured
the whole scheme.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.407
You know how girls are.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.416
They got all worked up
about rekindling the romance

24:11.450 --> 24:12.644
between you and Joan.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.208
It's like they're
on a mission...

24:14.252 --> 24:16.186
A mission from God is
what they're on.

24:16.221 --> 24:18.348
And Joan agreed to all this?

24:18.390 --> 24:20.756
She's very much looking
forward to it.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.422
Well, I, uh,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.455
don't want to ruin
your love lives.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.831
Are you on?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.405
What time you picking me up?

24:38.777 --> 24:40.506
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.775
Okay.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.215
Here you go.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.082
Steve and Brandon are
in the back with Nat.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.383
Want me to tell them
you're here?

24:50.422 --> 24:53.220
Actually, um, don't even
mention I was here, okay?

24:53.258 --> 24:54.384
You got it.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.758
See you, later.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.333
Hey, David.

25:12.377 --> 25:14.345
Hey, Val.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.279
How's it going?

25:16.314 --> 25:18.111
Good, good.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.776
Um, listen I've got to go.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.183
The food's getting cold.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.484
So, uh, I heard
Colin made bail.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.356
Yeah, yeah,
you heard right.

25:27.392 --> 25:28.791
Well, I hope you were
smart enough

25:28.827 --> 25:30.954
not to put up any
of your own money for that.

25:31.062 --> 25:32.689
You know what?

25:32.731 --> 25:34.062
That's none of
your business.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.329
So, I'll take that
as a no.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.336
You know,
I can't believe

25:38.370 --> 25:40.065
- you could be so stupid.
- You know,

25:40.105 --> 25:41.834
you were always so
jealous of Colin.

25:41.873 --> 25:42.840
Oh, yeah.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.102
There's a lot to
be jealous of there.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.610
You know, Val,
you don't make any sense.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.272
You went through hell
trying to keep your friends

25:48.313 --> 25:50.178
from knowing what was going on
between you and Ginger

25:50.215 --> 25:51.614
and now, and now
you're pulling this.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.140
What do you expect
everyone to just agree

25:53.184 --> 25:54.446
- with what you're doing?
- You know what?

25:54.486 --> 25:56.113
you have no right to
make accusations

25:56.154 --> 25:57.678
about anything I do.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.519
I trusted you and
you deserted me.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.685
Oh, I loved you and you were
willing to push me off

26:01.726 --> 26:02.920
on your friend
for the night.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.929
What do you think you're
gonna get out of this

26:04.996 --> 26:06.190
other than trouble?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.698
I know what you're
thinking, David.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.029
I know what everybody's
thinking.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.694
And I don't care.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.033
Maybe all of you should learn
a little bit about loyalty.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.470
You guys used to be
Colin's friend

26:14.506 --> 26:15.598
until he screwed up.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.267
And then you turned
your back on him.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.402
I won't do that, I never will.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.036
So what, what are you saying?
You love him?

26:21.079 --> 26:22.706
Yeah.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.214
Yeah, maybe I do.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.649
Well, just remember this, Val.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.346
When you play with dirt,
you get dirty.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.684
Well, thanks
for the fortune cookie, David.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.713
But keep it to yourself.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.291
Yes, you can wear cream
this time of year.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.302
No, Joan, you are not
overdressed.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.360
Yes, Nat,

26:45.403 --> 26:46.961
it is a limo.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.199
It's a stretch.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.831
Would you prefer
to go in a van?

26:49.874 --> 26:51.273
Okay, Joan, I'm hanging
up now, okay.

26:51.309 --> 26:53.072
No, Nat, I'm trying
to make this easy.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.578
You're the one
who's making it difficult.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.410
I'm hanging up now, good-bye.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.416
You have got to be kidding
me with these two.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.644
I'm not...
I'm not kidding...

26:59.684 --> 27:01.151
- Our lovebirds are freakin'.
- Yes, they are.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.915
Why did you guys have
to take her shopping?

27:03.021 --> 27:04.045
What did that
accomplish?

27:04.089 --> 27:05.886
All it did was put more
pressure on her.

27:05.924 --> 27:06.913
Wrong.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.585
Shopping takes
the pressure off...

27:08.627 --> 27:10.652
especially if you, uh,
start in footwear.

27:10.695 --> 27:11.662
Footwear.

27:11.696 --> 27:12.685
Hey, where have you been?

27:12.731 --> 27:13.698
Back in time.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.097
1971, to be exact.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.430
What a strange year.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.368
Look at this, the Dow
Jones was under 800 points.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.030
How romantic.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.936
Nixon was president.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.871
Oliver Stone was probably
still shooting on Super 8.

27:23.908 --> 27:24.932
Led Zeppelin released

27:24.976 --> 27:25.943
"Stairway to Heaven."

27:26.011 --> 27:27.876
And Sonny and Cher
still had a TV show.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.709
My mom still had
her TV show.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.545
My parents were still
living together.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.948
Boy, do things change, huh?

27:33.051 --> 27:34.143
Come on,

27:34.185 --> 27:35.652
- there's the limo.
- Okay.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.655
Okay.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.486
All right, so, uh,
it's all settled.

27:39.524 --> 27:40.718
- I'll meet you guys later?
- Yeah.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.158
So, you think you'll
have enough time

27:42.193 --> 27:43.251
- to set everything up?
- Absolutely.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.693
Absolutely,
I'll call you in the limo.

27:44.729 --> 27:45.957
Okay.

27:46.064 --> 27:48.157
I just really want everything
to be perfect, you know?

27:48.199 --> 27:51.134
Who knew you were
so sentimental?

27:51.169 --> 27:53.194
Uh, Brandon.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.206
You forgot something.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.731
Steve's cell phone, right,
right, right, right, right.

27:57.776 --> 27:58.902
No...

27:58.943 --> 28:00.934
this...

28:04.949 --> 28:09.113
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.729
So what do you feel like?

28:18.763 --> 28:19.889
Oh, I don't know.

28:19.931 --> 28:21.728
- Anything really.
- Hmm.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.734
A period romance?

28:23.768 --> 28:25.065
No.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.071
Okay, we can go
the other way.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.573
Uh, Brad, Keanu,
Johnny Depp...

28:29.607 --> 28:31.131
- Your pick.
- I don't think so.

28:31.176 --> 28:34.145
How about screwball comedy?

28:35.213 --> 28:36.840
Kel?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.280
Kelly!

28:38.316 --> 28:39.283
Greg, hi.

28:39.317 --> 28:40.306
This is so weird.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.943
- I was just gonna call you.
- You were?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.681
Yeah. Uh, hi, Donna, it's nice

28:43.722 --> 28:45.349
- to see you again.
- Yeah, you, too.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.687
I'll just go.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.249
Bye.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.090
So, you can't find a film?

28:50.128 --> 28:51.425
Oh, no, we can't decide.

28:51.463 --> 28:52.691
- How about you?
- I was gonna get

28:52.731 --> 28:54.130
a foreign film, but,
uh, I realized

28:54.165 --> 28:55.757
I just wasn't in the
mood for subtitles

28:55.800 --> 28:57.392
so I went back to
an old standby.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.426
- Which is?
- Best of the Three Stooges.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.665
Ah!

29:00.705 --> 29:02.696
Why were you gonna call me?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.208
Actually, I was
wondering if maybe

29:04.242 --> 29:06.107
you wanted to get a cup
of coffee sometime?

29:07.145 --> 29:09.113
Sure.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.512
- Okay.
- Great,

29:10.548 --> 29:11.913
I'll call you.
Are you listed?

29:11.950 --> 29:12.917
Yeah.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.213
Uh, K. Taylor. At the beach.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.241
- No address.
- All right,

29:15.286 --> 29:16.253
K. Taylor at the beach.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.254
I'm looking forward to it.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.585
Me, too.

29:18.623 --> 29:20.614
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.422
Hey, what was that all about?

29:26.464 --> 29:29.433
He just asked me out.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.435
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.300
Hmm.

29:33.338 --> 29:34.635
He's perfect for you, Kel.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.003
Good-looking and a doctor, too.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.940
I have to say one thing.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.106
You guys really know

29:43.148 --> 29:44.775
how to show a girl a good time.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.283
I second that motion.

29:46.317 --> 29:47.443
I just wish Brando were here.

29:47.485 --> 29:49.646
- Mmm.
- I told you, he's busy

29:49.687 --> 29:51.211
and, besides which,
it's a surprise.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.281
Don't worry about it,
we'll meet up with him later.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.621
So where are we going now?

29:54.659 --> 29:57.287
The site of your first date.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.741
Ah, the Tail O' the Pup.

30:14.779 --> 30:17.771
How did you know?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.250
They did some very good
research.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.651
Boy, you were a big
spender, Nat.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.951
Thank you.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.425
Do you remember,
you remember

30:29.460 --> 30:31.428
when this joint was
across the street, Joanie?

30:31.462 --> 30:32.759
Yeah.

30:32.797 --> 30:33.923
You know this corner was

30:33.965 --> 30:35.557
where they-they used to
have pony rides.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.658
- I remember that.
- Yeah.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.293
That was before the Beverly
Center was built.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.735
I had my fourth birthday here.

30:40.939 --> 30:41.997
Yes, sirree.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.598
All right, a toast.

30:43.641 --> 30:44.835
- Oh!
- Woo!

30:44.876 --> 30:46.173
Woo!

30:46.211 --> 30:48.179
To Joan...

30:48.213 --> 30:49.441
Thank you.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.277
...and Nat.
- Thanks, Pal.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.281
To happiness.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.153
To love.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.418
To ponies.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.858
And to living to a ripe old age.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.328
And for staying young.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.456
- Cheers.
- Ah!

31:07.498 --> 31:08.795
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

31:08.833 --> 31:09.822
So,

31:09.868 --> 31:10.835
how'd you guys meet?

31:10.869 --> 31:11.858
We met on a casting

31:11.903 --> 31:12.927
session.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.939
Yeah, it was Bonanza.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.873
I was reading for
the, uh, bad guy,

31:16.908 --> 31:18.500
and she was reading for
the school teacher.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.340
Little Joe's love interest.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.436
Did you get the part?

31:21.479 --> 31:23.413
- No, of course not.
- Well...

31:24.449 --> 31:26.679
I got a callback.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.810
How about you guys?

31:27.852 --> 31:28.876
How did you meet Brandon?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.252
Oh, it was a workplace romance.

31:31.289 --> 31:32.415
I hired him.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.254
Classic case
of sexual harassment.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.316
Yes, but I still can't

31:35.360 --> 31:37.157
quite figure out
if I was the harasser

31:37.195 --> 31:38.560
or the harassee.

31:38.596 --> 31:40.120
I've known Clare
for a while,

31:40.164 --> 31:42.462
but it wasn't until she
started tutoring me

31:42.500 --> 31:43.967
that I fell in love with her.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.299
He was the perfect student.

31:45.336 --> 31:46.963
Did everything
the teacher wanted.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.267
I bribed her

31:48.306 --> 31:49.398
with charm.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.737
Hey, go easy, okay,

31:50.775 --> 31:52.766
you still can't do long division
without a calculator.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.141
- Like I have to.
- Uh-huh.

31:54.178 --> 31:56.840
Listen, this is really great

31:56.881 --> 31:59.509
but, um, where are
we going next?

31:59.550 --> 32:02.781
Well, you just have to wait
and see.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.789
- Oh. All right.
- Okay.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.814
May I have more while
I wait and see?

32:13.665 --> 32:15.656
Ooh!

32:18.336 --> 32:20.327
Popcorn's ready.

32:22.006 --> 32:24.304
So, what movie are
we watching first?

32:24.342 --> 32:26.310
Soapdish is already in.

32:26.344 --> 32:27.572
Where's the remote?

32:27.612 --> 32:28.636
Uh, I think it's...

32:32.684 --> 32:34.982
Hello.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.988
Tara... I can't hear you.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.512
Speak up. Where are you?

32:39.557 --> 32:40.990
In Venice somewhere.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.151
I had to bail.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.990
You ran away?

32:44.028 --> 32:45.655
I just couldn't take it anymore.

32:45.697 --> 32:46.823
Please don't hate me, Kelly?

32:46.864 --> 32:48.092
Stop it. I don't hate you.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.326
Just tell me where you are.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.825
Ozone and Speedway,
near the bridge.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.497
Look, stay there, all right.

32:54.539 --> 32:55.631
And stay clean.

32:55.673 --> 32:56.970
I'll be right there.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.703
Okay.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.370
What's going on?

33:00.411 --> 33:02.038
Tara's in trouble.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.707
I'll drive.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.215
Thanks, Donna.

33:33.378 --> 33:36.313
Remember the night we saw
the Doors at the Whisky?

33:36.347 --> 33:39.510
No, I never saw the
Doors at the Whisky.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.518
Oh, well, it must have
been somebody else.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.819
Lord help me, I can't
even remember who.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.752
Well, too bad
Perino's is closed.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.820
We could have taken you
guys out for the best

33:52.864 --> 33:55.526
cannelloni west
of New York, bar none.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.431
Whenever we had something
to celebrate,

33:57.468 --> 33:59.163
that's where we went.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.761
Where are we now?

34:00.805 --> 34:02.864
932 Las Palmas.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.382
I haven't driven
by here in years.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.518
It's gone.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.757
It is totally gone.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.733
Remember that little
bungalow, Joanie?

34:29.766 --> 34:31.928
I sure do.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.933
It was this cutest little place.

34:36.974 --> 34:38.771
The...

34:38.810 --> 34:40.300
the whole street
was lined with

34:40.344 --> 34:42.777
Hollywood bungalows, you know?

34:42.813 --> 34:44.304
And you guys
lived together?

34:45.349 --> 34:46.373
Yeah.

34:48.985 --> 34:50.385
For a while.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.358
Give me a second, I'll be back.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.628
Our parents were furious

35:08.673 --> 35:10.937
about the situation,
and the fact that

35:10.975 --> 35:12.772
he was Catholic
and I was Jewish...

35:12.810 --> 35:14.402
believe me, it didn't help.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.037
Is that what ended it
with you two?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.310
It had a lot to do with it.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.779
I'm gonna go see
what Nat's doing.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.500
This is where the
front walk used to be.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.767
Yeah, I think you're right.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.298
Remember all the
night bloom jasmine

35:45.343 --> 35:47.243
- that was in the front yard?
- Yeah,

35:47.278 --> 35:49.439
right outside
the bedroom window.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.004
Yeah.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.985
I remember everything.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.213
So do I.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.621
Every detail.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.335
All right.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.035
Go, Nat.

36:18.075 --> 36:19.770
It's working.

36:37.895 --> 36:38.953
Kelly!

36:38.996 --> 36:39.963
Tara.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.192
Kelly, get me
out of here, please.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.962
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Are you all right?

36:44.001 --> 36:45.195
It's okay.

36:45.236 --> 36:47.261
I tried to call you,
but you weren't there,

36:47.305 --> 36:49.136
and I just got so desperate
and so lonely,

36:49.173 --> 36:50.697
and I just had
to get out of there.

36:50.741 --> 36:51.833
Please don't
make me go back.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.207
Well, I think it might
be the best thing.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.269
Please, I just...
I just need to be with you.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.247
Can't I just stay
at your apartment?

36:57.281 --> 36:58.976
It's okay with me, Kel.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.348
All right, but I'm
gonna call the unit

37:01.385 --> 37:02.647
and tell them where you are.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.382
Okay, that's a good idea.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.447
Thanks for coming
to get me, you guys.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.582
We wouldn't leave
you out here.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.252
Just get in the car,
and we'll go home.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.420
Yeah, come on.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.692
So this is what it's like
to have friends, huh?

37:31.916 --> 37:33.884
So, what do you guys usually do

37:33.918 --> 37:35.283
on Saturday nights?

37:35.319 --> 37:37.082
Oh, we go out
in stretch limos.

37:37.121 --> 37:38.884
- I mean, doesn't everyone?
- Sure.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.353
I'll tell you what they do.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.620
They come by me.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.924
I feed them,
then they go next door

37:44.962 --> 37:46.486
and hear loud music.

37:46.530 --> 37:47.895
Real romantic.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.366
Hey, hello,
we're very romantic, okay?

37:50.401 --> 37:51.390
Really?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.834
What's the most romantic date

37:52.870 --> 37:53.894
you've ever been on?

37:53.938 --> 37:55.872
Uh, that's a trick question.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.339
Just make sure
our answers

37:57.375 --> 37:59.366
include our present
partners only.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.275
And what's that
supposed to mean?

38:01.312 --> 38:03.644
Wasn't your, uh,
most romantic date with me?

38:03.681 --> 38:04.648
It was.

38:04.682 --> 38:05.671
When?

38:05.716 --> 38:07.115
Tonight.

38:07.151 --> 38:08.914
I think this is the
most romantic evening

38:09.020 --> 38:10.078
we've ever spent together.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.280
Hello?

38:14.325 --> 38:15.622
How's it going?

38:15.660 --> 38:17.525
Everything's perfect,
exactly according to plan.

38:17.561 --> 38:18.789
- How about you?
- Ready here.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.093
Great, we'll be there
in ten minutes... bye.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.121
That was Brandon.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.326
He's meeting us there.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.096
Great, this is getting
better by the minute.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.194
Where are we going now?

38:26.237 --> 38:28.762
Oh, the last stop
is a real surprise.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.442
Here we are.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.774
Nice crib.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.910
Thanks.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.943
I knew you guys must
live in a nice place,

38:44.021 --> 38:47.252
but this is like
living in a magazine.

38:47.291 --> 38:50.055
Uh... does anyone
want coffee?

38:50.094 --> 38:51.857
I would love some.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.488
Sure, thanks.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.520
You got it.

38:54.565 --> 38:55.827
Uh, there's popcorn
on the table,

38:55.866 --> 38:58.528
and a movie's
in the VCR already, so...

38:59.970 --> 39:01.301
You heard her.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.466
Come sit down, we were
just getting ready to start

39:03.507 --> 39:04.838
before you called.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.582
By any chance, were you
guys looking for this?

39:13.617 --> 39:14.641
Tara found the remote.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.812
We've been looking
for this all day.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.220
Cool, now we're all set.

39:19.256 --> 39:21.622
So, let her rip.

39:21.659 --> 39:24.093
Pass the popcorn, please.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.254
Here you go.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.321
Thanks.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.560
I know this is only
for one night,

39:29.600 --> 39:32.034
but it's better therapy
than I can get anywhere.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.934
Well, don't try
sweet-talking us.

39:34.004 --> 39:35.437
You're going back tomorrow.

39:35.473 --> 39:37.771
I know.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.538
I know, I know.

39:45.516 --> 39:47.211
Lights out.

39:47.251 --> 39:48.718
Is anybody gonna
cry tonight?

39:48.753 --> 39:50.414
I got ten bucks that says

39:50.454 --> 39:53.082
the new pigeon cries
for his mama before morning.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.649
You know the one, the one
that took the little joy ride.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.058
You know, he's right
next door to me.

39:57.094 --> 39:59.460
- I'll make him cry.
- And say,

39:59.497 --> 40:01.362
he can cry on my
shoulder anytime.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.299
Come on, mama's boy,
let's hear you cry.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.325
- Is anybody gonna cry tonight?
- Come on, sweetheart.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.961
Let's hear those teardrops fall.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.368
Let's hear
those teardrops fall.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.896
Shut up!

40:09.940 --> 40:11.840
- Let's hear those...
- Shut up, shut up!

40:11.876 --> 40:13.104
Shut up!

40:13.144 --> 40:14.338
Hey, hey.

40:14.378 --> 40:15.970
Hey, what's wrong?

40:16.013 --> 40:17.207
You okay?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.579
It's okay, it's okay.

40:18.616 --> 40:19.844
You're here, you're here.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.215
- What's wrong?
- I can't...

40:21.252 --> 40:23.311
I can't go to prison.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.616
I cannot go to prison.

40:24.655 --> 40:25.986
I won't make it.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.284
No, no, no, no,
you're not...

40:27.324 --> 40:28.518
you're not going
back to prison.

40:28.559 --> 40:29.753
I won't let that happen.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.785
It's okay.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.263
Why are you standing by me?

40:34.298 --> 40:35.788
I sabotage everything,

40:35.833 --> 40:38.199
every decent thing
that gets in my way.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.468
Past is past, okay?

40:42.506 --> 40:44.997
I love you.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.135
And I'll do anything I can.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.806
Okay?

41:15.072 --> 41:16.061
Woo-hoo!

41:16.106 --> 41:18.802
Wow, Excelsior Hotel!

41:20.377 --> 41:21.435
Place look familiar?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.470
Oh, it's been closed for years.

41:23.514 --> 41:26.108
Do you guys remember
the Stardust Ballroom?

41:26.150 --> 41:27.549
Oh, God, do we ever.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.746
We... we wore out
the dance floor, didn't we?

41:29.787 --> 41:31.584
Yeah... this used to be

41:31.622 --> 41:33.283
one of the most
romantic nightclubs

41:33.324 --> 41:34.723
in Los Angeles.

41:34.758 --> 41:37.352
All the stars
used to come here.

41:37.394 --> 41:39.988
It was the place
to be seen.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.998
Even when rock and
roll was the rage,

41:42.099 --> 41:43.589
everyone who was anyone

41:43.634 --> 41:45.625
still came to the
Stardust Ballroom.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.136
Well, they still do.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.008
Whoa.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.009
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:59.116 --> 42:01.311
Welcome
to the Stardust Ballroom.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.320
Maestro, the music, please.

42:12.696 --> 42:14.994
How did you ever
pull this off?

42:16.834 --> 42:18.597
Well, we pulled some strings.

42:19.837 --> 42:23.136
That's where we sat
the first time we came here.

42:23.173 --> 42:25.141
And something else
pretty special

42:25.175 --> 42:26.267
happened that night, too.

42:26.310 --> 42:27.538
What was that?

42:27.578 --> 42:29.375
Our first kiss.

42:29.413 --> 42:30.744
Aw.

42:32.983 --> 42:34.450
Care to dance?

42:34.485 --> 42:36.248
I'd love to.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.652
Come on.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.788
This is the most
terrific night.

42:40.824 --> 42:42.553
The night is still young.

42:43.694 --> 42:44.888
Thank you for making all the

42:44.929 --> 42:47.124
wonderful memories
come alive again.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.792
Oh, I think we have those
guys over there to thank.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.323
In fact, I think
we taught them

42:51.368 --> 42:53.598
a little something
about romance, didn't we?

42:53.637 --> 42:55.696
Maybe we did.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.138
What do you say, babe?

42:57.174 --> 42:58.573
Love to.

43:03.213 --> 43:05.340
How about it, beautiful?

43:05.382 --> 43:08.749
Charmed.
