00:06.373 --> 00:09.274
-Well, that was all right, huh?
-Yeah.

00:09.442 --> 00:10.875
Well...

00:11.044 --> 00:13.012
-...good night.
-Yeah, good night.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.110
Jerry, we can only stay four days.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.221
Well, I'm upset,
but we'll make the most of it.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.254
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

00:58.425 --> 01:01.724
Yes. Oh, your father bought
an exercise device off television.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.294
He does it every morning at 4.

01:03.463 --> 01:07.160
Only 25 minutes a day, and you can
attach it to any doorknob.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.761
So I guess your travel miles
are about to expire?

01:10.937 --> 01:14.634
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted
to talk to you about something.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.402
Am I finally getting a baby brother?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.142
Jerry, be serious.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.473
How would you feel
if we sold the Cadillac?

01:21.648 --> 01:23.843
What? The Cadillac
I bought for you?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.382
It's too much car, Jerry.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.919
Oh, come on. You love that car.
What about the Northstar system?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.148
I don't think we even use it.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.925
Well, it's a gift,
and I want you to keep it.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.493
We already sold it.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.156
Why didn't you tell me
before you sold it?

01:38.331 --> 01:41.027
We had a buyer, and we couldn't
get a free flight until now.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.828
We could but we wanted
the bulkhead.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.629
Oh, my God.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.302
Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

01:48.475 --> 01:51.103
-Kramer....
-No, no, no, it's not the sex, Jerry.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.505
Hey, Seinfelds.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.340
-Hi, Kramer.
-Hi, Kramer.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.039
-We're in the middle of a discussion.
-Yeah? What about?

01:57.217 --> 01:59.185
Jerry's upset.
We sold the Cadillac.

01:59.352 --> 02:02.116
-What did you get for it?
-Jack Klompus gave us 6 grand.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.620
You sold my Cadillac
to Jack Klompus?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.122
We want you to have the money.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.419
-I don't need money.
-What are you talking about?

02:08.595 --> 02:10.187
You had a check bounce
at the bodega.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.730
Is that what this is all about? I bounce
a check and you sold a Cadillac?

02:13.900 --> 02:17.392
Well, also, Jerry, we read
an article in the Sun-Sentinel.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.266
It says that standup comedy
is not what it used to be...

02:20.440 --> 02:22.237
...what with Def Jam and all.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.035
Yeah, that Def Jam is a force.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.377
Jerry, you know,
I hear wonderful things...

02:27.547 --> 02:29.845
...about Bloomingdale's
executive training program.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.540
Oh, my God.

02:31.718 --> 02:34.050
You've given this comedy thing
your best shot.

02:34.220 --> 02:37.121
Yeah, you had some
good observations, but it's over.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.155
Now, this Bloomingdale thing:

02:39.325 --> 02:41.020
That could be the next wave.

02:46.099 --> 02:50.035
Excuse me. A pound
of Arabian Mocha Java, please.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.338
So you understand how my Peterman
stock options are gonna work?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.235
I'm going to the bathroom.

02:55.408 --> 02:57.876
It's just very interesting.

02:58.044 --> 03:00.672
Yeah, when it's your money
it's fascinating.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.781
Arabian Mocha Java.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.573
Oh, I got it.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.543
That Arabian is strong coffee.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.282
It's PLO blend.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.788
Oh, I got your coffee.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.419
-Oh, here, let me--
-No, it's on me.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.690
Oh, man. Okay, listen, guys,
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you, okay?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.834
-Yeah.
-Bye.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.769
-You see what just happened here?
-What?

03:27.407 --> 03:30.069
She treated me
to the Arabian Mocha Java.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.473
And you misinterpret this how?

03:32.946 --> 03:35.073
She's sticking it to me that
she makes more money.

03:35.248 --> 03:38.479
I'm sure she was just being nice
buying you the coffee.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.879
Not nice. Sticking it to me.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.577
-You're crazy.
-Sticking it to me.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.745
-George.
-Sticking it!

03:46.226 --> 03:48.285
So you're buying the car
back for your parents?

03:48.461 --> 03:51.953
-I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
-Your parents will never let you do it.

03:52.131 --> 03:55.658
They lie to me about selling the car,
I'll lie to them about buying it back.

03:55.835 --> 03:59.100
They think they can dump
6 grand on me? Think again.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.672
What kind of money
you think your parents have?

04:02.842 --> 04:05.333
-Excuse me?
-Bet they have more money than mine.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.176
-Come on. Your parents have money.
-You think?

04:08.348 --> 04:10.612
-When do they ever spend money?
-Never.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.410
-What are their expenses?
-Nothing.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.485
-Where do they go on vacation?
-Nowhere.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.753
-How much do you think they have?
-Few hundred grand?

04:18.925 --> 04:22.986
You're saying I stand to inherit
$300,000? Is that what you're saying?

04:23.162 --> 04:26.154
-You may not see it for 20 years.
-Twenty years? That long?

04:26.332 --> 04:28.197
Your father eat
bacon and eggs every day?

04:28.368 --> 04:30.097
Unfortunately, yes.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.832
How's your family history?

04:32.171 --> 04:34.503
-I have an aunt that died at 7.
-Really?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.737
Aunt Baby.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.671
-Elaine, you got a moment?
-Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

04:42.081 --> 04:45.312
I need to speak to you
about some lady problems.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.350
Okay.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.851
You know, after I have sex with Emily,
I don't want her in the bed anymore.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.790
Yeah, because she's
throwing off my whole sleep.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.829
-She's got the jimmy legs.
-Jimmy legs?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.463
Jimmy leg.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.902
So.... Well, maybe I should
just be honest with her, huh?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.404
Tell her after sex
you just want her out of there?

05:08.574 --> 05:11.168
Well, I'd say it nicely.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.239
I don't think so.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.877
Well, you know,
I really like this girl.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.017
I think if I could
work out this one thing--

05:18.184 --> 05:20.448
Yeah, I gotta be
honest with you, Kramer.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.056
You might be more than
just a couple of tweaks away...

05:24.223 --> 05:26.521
...from a healthy relationship.

05:27.226 --> 05:30.753
Well, you're not exactly
zeroing in yourself, lady.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.586
All right, get out.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.494
Get out!

05:36.536 --> 05:39.903
So listen, I've gotta go down to
Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.540
You just heard about this today?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.438
They had a cancellation,
and they instantly called me.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.942
-Who cancelled?
-Carrot Top.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.512
I told you: My career is fine.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.911
I've been thinking about the family.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.853
Tell me about Aunt Baby.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.057
She's deceased.

06:01.794 --> 06:02.783
Yeah.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.760
Why did she die so young?

06:05.164 --> 06:07.359
She had problems.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.625
Internal.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.701
Is that common in our family?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.101
Well, your Uncle Moe,
he died a young man.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.264
Also internal problems.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.342
It's that temper on your side.

06:18.511 --> 06:22.971
They're yelling and yelling and then
one day, they're all gone.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.413
What about your side?
Your cousin Henny.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.883
She was sickly
from the moment I met her.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.988
Don't you talk about Henny!

06:30.757 --> 06:32.418
So I guess you two
are the lucky ones.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.387
So far.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.192
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today,
how old would she be?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.298
She'd never make it.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.874
So let me get this straight.
You enjoy the lovemaking--

06:50.309 --> 06:54.109
-Well, do you?
-Oh, yeah. Like strawberry pie.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.644
Okay. But you have a problem
sharing a bed with me.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.785
I know it's not what the ladies like...

06:59.952 --> 07:02.944
...but without some solid sack time,
I'm a zombie.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.989
-I don't know.
-Oh, come on, man.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.990
Meet me halfway.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.228
-You're not easy, Kramer.
-I know.

07:16.302 --> 07:21.296
So to what do I owe the pleasure
of this unannounced visit?

07:21.474 --> 07:23.135
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.368
You wanna buy it back? Why?

07:25.545 --> 07:28.275
You got drugs hidden in the trunk?

07:29.482 --> 07:32.849
-I'm kidding.
-All right. I'll give you 9000 for it.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.817
Nine thousand for a Cadillac?
It's got no miles on it.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.650
-You bought it for six.
-You're not me.

07:40.259 --> 07:45.390
-How much do you want for it?
-The Kelley Blue Book value: $22,000.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.896
Fourteen thousand.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.661
Done. But I get
to drive it tomorrow...

07:50.837 --> 07:52.805
...because Doris
wants to go to Naples.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.599
You need a pen?

07:57.109 --> 07:58.633
Still works.

08:01.681 --> 08:02.909
Hey, where's Jerry?

08:03.082 --> 08:05.016
He's performing at Bally's
in Atlantic City.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.311
Oh, okay.

08:07.787 --> 08:11.416
Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.888
He always hides it from me.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.829
Yeah, Bally's?
Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.328
You know that number?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.490
I used to have a problem.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.360
What do you mean,
he's not registered?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.702
-Well, S-E-l-N-V--
-F. F-E-L-D.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.968
F-E-L-D.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.842
Well, I think you're wrong.

08:36.549 --> 08:39.017
All right, you have a lucky day too.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.414
-He's not there?
-No, they never heard of him.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.624
This is so nice of you to take us
all out to dinner, George.

08:48.794 --> 08:52.628
Well, as much as I enjoy
all the good-natured ribbing...

08:52.798 --> 08:54.459
...nothing really
makes me happier...

08:54.634 --> 08:57.068
...than spending money
on the people I care about.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.771
-Where's Jerry?
-Oh, he'll be here.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.533
By the way, Elaine, thank you...

09:02.708 --> 09:05.802
...for laying out
for the Arabian Mocha Java.

09:05.978 --> 09:09.004
George, you didn't have to do this.

09:09.181 --> 09:13.242
I'm president of a big company.
I can afford to buy you coffee.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.080
-President?
-Yeah.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.949
-Hey, look, he's back. Hey.
-Hey.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.115
I got your message so I came
straight from Atlantic City.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.386
Kramer called Bally's.
You weren't registered.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.323
Well, I can't stay
under my own name.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.399
I was registered
under "Slappy White."

09:31.470 --> 09:33.062
Mom. Dad.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.936
Well, look who's here.
Hello, Seinfelds.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.612
-What are you doing here?
-We're having an upscale dinner.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.682
-What?
-Well, after talking to you...

09:44.850 --> 09:47.648
...we realized we may not
have much time left.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.651
So we're blowing it all.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.890
Look, George, it's a Pierre Cardin.

09:59.565 --> 10:03.661
-That was all right.
-Yeah.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.873
Well, I'll see you.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.080
-Hello.
-Jerry.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.876
I had a little mishap with the car.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.655
I'm down here in Alligator Alley.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.059
-You better get down here.
-All right.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.054
Who was that?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.390
That was the Golden Nugget...

11:05.564 --> 11:07.361
...also in Atlantic City.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.967
They heard such good things
about my show at Bally's...

11:10.136 --> 11:11.728
...they want me for tonight.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.901
So I'll have to repack and go.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.277
That didn't sound
like the Golden Nugget.

11:22.448 --> 11:26.248
I'm worried. What happens
if we have to support Jerry?

11:26.752 --> 11:29.721
-I'll have to go back to work.
-Where would you work?

11:30.189 --> 11:32.248
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.

11:38.864 --> 11:43.961
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, I'm not sure
I understand why you want a job here.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.364
What's not to understand?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.665
Well, for one thing,
you live in Florida.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.601
I'm very comfortable
working out of the house.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.540
I have a phone.
We have a Kinko's nearby.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.743
You know, I think
that my résumé speaks for itself.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.943
-Where is your résumé?
-I don't have it. I'll mail you one.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.314
All right, Mr. Seinfeld...

12:03.489 --> 12:05.923
...what kind of a position
did you have in mind?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.753
-You sell clothes, don't you?
-Yeah.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.988
Well, I sold raincoats
in the garment center for 38 years.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.655
-ln 1 949--
-All right. All right. All right.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.099
You come in tomorrow.
We'll find something for you to do.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.101
You won't regret this, Ms. Benes.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.001
What time should I be in?
I get up at 4.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.971
I could be here as early as 4:25.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.505
Oh, Elaine...

12:27.680 --> 12:31.548
...this dry air is curing me
like a Black Forest ham.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.850
Mr. Peterman? You're back.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.785
Who's Mr. Fancy?

12:44.797 --> 12:47.163
I was thinking maybe
I should spend the night.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.564
Oh, that's sweet, but actually, l....

12:50.903 --> 12:53.133
I think I'd prefer it if you left.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.930
-What?
-You were completely right.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.303
I sleep so much better
when I'm alone.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.979
-And you scream in your sleep.
-I do?

13:06.285 --> 13:09.777
There was a man. He was trying
to get into my apartment last night.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.455
He was jiggling the doorknob
for 25 minutes.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.160
-Come on. It was probably the wind.
-No, no.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.193
No, it was a fearless cat burglar.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.423
Now, listen, you gotta
let me sleep here.

13:20.599 --> 13:24.831
I'll stay over here on my side,
and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.631
Because I don't wanna sleep alone.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.298
Well, I do.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.946
What took you so long?

13:38.117 --> 13:40.381
I live in New York.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.552
What the hell happened?

13:42.721 --> 13:45.212
This thing is a behemoth.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.858
What did you do?

13:47.026 --> 13:50.154
I was making a simple lane change.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.423
I put on the blinker,
and it took off on me.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.692
And the next thing you know,
I was submerged.

13:55.868 --> 14:00.066
I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky
that those crocs didn't get me.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.073
You are such an idiot.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.874
Well, we got to get the car
cleaned up for my parents.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.214
Do whatever you want. It's your car.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.583
My car? You drove it
into the swamp.

14:18.757 --> 14:21.749
It drove itself into the swamp.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.886
Besides, I think I lost my pen too.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.863
You know, that almost
makes this all worthwhile.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.472
Why is there a Cadillac parked
in front of the house?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.569
That's your mother's new car.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.106
You bought that?

14:40.279 --> 14:42.144
It's a coupe de elegance.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.175
Your father wanted a Mercedes...

14:45.351 --> 14:48.218
...but I won't ride in a German car.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.456
Morning.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.654
Oh, boy.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.619
What the hell is going on here?

14:57.796 --> 14:59.787
I had some trouble at my place.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.593
So I need a little company
at night to sleep.

15:03.636 --> 15:08.403
George, your mother and l
and Kramer have been talking.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.701
-Oh, God.
-George...

15:10.876 --> 15:13.538
...your parents can't blow
their savings in this community.

15:13.712 --> 15:17.273
It's low-rent. We feel that Florida is
really the place where they should be.

15:17.449 --> 15:20.577
You can drop a grand
in Disney World like that.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.619
Wait a minute. You're moving
to Florida again?

15:23.789 --> 15:27.452
Well, it's either that
or we stay here near you...

15:27.626 --> 15:29.890
...and just sit on the money.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.656
What do you think
we should do, Georgie?

15:37.469 --> 15:41.132
So effective immediately, Ms. Benes
will return to her old position...

15:41.307 --> 15:45.676
...at her original salary and l,
of course, will return to mine.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.005
Kudos, Elaine, on a job...

15:48.180 --> 15:49.169
...done.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.149
What about my stock options?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.218
I think not.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.154
Now down to business.
I have had this vision...

15:58.324 --> 16:00.815
...of a diaphanous rumrunner scarf.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.860
Well, we could fly some fabric in
from our silk factories...

16:04.029 --> 16:07.157
-...for about $1 000 dollars a bolt.
-A thousand?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.563
I know a couple of Chinamen
over on 43rd Street...

16:09.735 --> 16:13.000
-...that will do it for half that.
-It's, Asian Americans.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.730
What?

16:14.907 --> 16:17.501
Who are you?

16:17.676 --> 16:19.166
-Don't worry--
-Morty Seinfeld.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.473
I cut velvet for 40 years
with Harry Alper.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.275
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, this is not--

16:24.450 --> 16:26.680
Elaine, did you hire this man?

16:26.852 --> 16:32.188
No, no-- Well, I mean, he's more
like an intern, you know, at best.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.727
So if your parents move to Florida,
you're poor.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.295
-But happy.
-Obviously.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.992
And if they stay, you're rich, but....

16:43.335 --> 16:45.132
Obviously.

16:45.537 --> 16:46.765
It's quite a dilemma.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.669
You know, I have
a bit of a dilemma of my own.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.070
No, no, no.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.871
We're staying on me.
We haven't solved anything yet.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.879
All right. This is easy.
Just let them go. So now, listen--

16:57.049 --> 16:59.244
What do you mean?
They're spending all my money.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.648
All right. Then they stay.
Let me ask you a ques--

17:01.820 --> 17:03.845
Could you put
a little thought into this?

17:04.022 --> 17:07.049
Jerry's gone. You could humor me.
He humors me.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.625
Speaking of Jerry...

17:08.794 --> 17:12.890
...his father is driving me
so crazy down at Peterman's.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.727
Know what I do when one of these
guys is breathing down my neck?

17:15.901 --> 17:17.800
-What?
-You schedule a late meeting.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.396
-What does that do?
-Old guys are up at 4 a.m.

17:20.571 --> 17:23.097
By 2:30, they're wiped--
How did we get back on to you?

17:23.275 --> 17:24.571
I gotta go.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.509
You know I got nothing out of this.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.282
-Hey, Frank.
-Yeah.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.680
You got two beds in here.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.447
That's right. That's me on the left.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.318
So you sleep in separate beds.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.288
Thirty years ago
we came to an agreement.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.984
The only way
I could get some rest.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.652
Really?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.889
Estelle has got the jimmy arms.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.924
You can get that in your arms?

17:49.101 --> 17:51.262
Like you wouldn't believe.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.040
Jerry, it's getting late.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.874
You cleaned up the car.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.477
You made all your phone calls.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.238
Why are you still here?

18:03.882 --> 18:06.578
Well, I maxed out my credit cards.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.210
And I don't have enough cash
for a hotel room.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.256
-So....
-You are thinking of staying here?

18:13.425 --> 18:16.758
-Well....
-You've got some nerve.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.421
I almost break my neck
in that deathtrap of yours...

18:20.599 --> 18:22.658
...and now you ask me for a favor?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.427
Didn't like that crack
about the pen?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.332
I did not.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.467
Well, I've given this
a lot of thought...

18:31.643 --> 18:33.235
...and I've gotta say--

18:35.314 --> 18:37.976
As much as I'd like to see
the two of you living it up...

18:38.150 --> 18:40.948
...in a warm, tropical setting...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.849
...I would just miss you too much.

18:43.021 --> 18:45.512
So I've decided...

18:45.691 --> 18:48.683
...I want you to stay.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.459
It's too late.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.563
We bought a condo
at Del Boca Vista.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.562
We're leaving tonight.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.969
You said it was my call.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.264
We were just being nice.

19:01.707 --> 19:05.803
Cosmo, are you sure you're
gonna be all right here alone?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.173
Oh, yeah, I got Emily
coming over tonight.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.008
You're letting him
have a woman over?

19:10.182 --> 19:12.548
He's not family.
It's different psychologically.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.681
And so I made an explosive
out of chickpeas.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.362
And I stopped that great rhino
right in his tracks.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.828
-It's getting late. Why don't we--
-Mr. Peterman...

19:26.999 --> 19:31.026
...that can't have been the only time
that you faced mortal danger.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.236
Funny you should ask, Elaine.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.600
If we're gonna stay
till all hours of the night...

19:35.774 --> 19:37.639
...can't we at least
get some food here?

19:38.210 --> 19:40.007
It's only 5:1 5.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.339
So later on that same day...

19:43.515 --> 19:46.450
...I developed a great hankering
for some wild honey.

19:46.618 --> 19:47.846
Okay, I'm done.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.547
I'll be back in the morning when
he's close to finished with this story.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.384
Morty.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.084
My stories
are what sell these clothes.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.593
Cheap fabric and dim lighting:

19:58.764 --> 20:00.857
That's how you move merchandise.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.533
Okay.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.725
You're out.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.767
I never knew what I was
peddling with those stupid cartoons...

20:07.940 --> 20:10.135
...and that paper book anyway.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.129
I don't know why I let you talk me
into that corned beef at Snitzers.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.929
-No one held a gun to your head.
-Yeah.

20:39.104 --> 20:41.436
Don't forget: We're eating
at the Fidermans' tomorrow.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.598
Why do I have to go?
They're your friends.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.868
-You like them.
-I've had it with them.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.943
Then we won't go.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.640
Okay, okay. What time?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.813
Eight-thirty.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.055
That was all right.

21:08.900 --> 21:13.928
"One bright note in today's market
was the stock of retailer J. Peterman...

21:14.106 --> 21:17.269
...whose founder's surprise return
generated a rise...

21:17.442 --> 21:20.434
...of 1 2 and a half points."

21:22.247 --> 21:24.511
That means if you still had
those stock options....

21:24.683 --> 21:25.911
Yeah.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.414
That's a shame.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.478
What are you, sticking it to me?

21:31.156 --> 21:33.454
-What?
-I think you're sticking it to me.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.490
I'm sure George
is just being sympathetic.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.889
Sticking it!

21:38.930 --> 21:40.864
You're not alone.
I'm practically broke.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.591
-Really?
-No.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.133
But...

21:44.303 --> 21:46.794
...I did blow over 20,000
on that Cadillac.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.535
Delicious.

21:49.708 --> 21:53.303
-You seem happy.
-Hey, the folks are 1 200 miles away.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.412
I'm basking in the buffer zone.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.343
Another piece of pie here.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.181
So were your parents shocked
to see the Cadillac?

22:00.352 --> 22:02.684
Actually, I haven't heard
from them yet.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.446
When are we gonna tell Jerry?

22:04.623 --> 22:06.090
I don't wanna worry him.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.783
We'll tell him next time we go up.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.890
He thought he could buy back
that Cadillac for us?

22:12.064 --> 22:14.123
He's not getting away with that.

22:14.599 --> 22:18.194
Besides, that condo
was too much house.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.607
How many times
can you check the car?

22:24.776 --> 22:27.040
I saw a bum sleeping
in the Cadillac the other day.

22:27.212 --> 22:31.012
Why would someone
break into a car to take a nap?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.117
They don't nap.
They make it their home.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.912
They urinate in there.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.850
You're driving me crazy.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.582
That's it. We're going back
to Queens. Where's my hat?

22:39.758 --> 22:41.817
No!
