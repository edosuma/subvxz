00:47.088 --> 00:48.590
Who's there?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.840
Are you all right?

01:29.882 --> 01:31.174
What happened?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.092
Please...

01:33.134 --> 01:34.803
I'll go get some help.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.810
Run!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.192
Are you excited?

02:31.234 --> 02:34.446
Yeah.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.075
So you given any more thought
to any clubs or anything?

02:38.117 --> 02:39.785
I don't think I'm gonna do that.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.246
It's a great way to make friends.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.915
I already had friends, Dad.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.626
I needed to get my life
back on track, Riley.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.669
I know.
And for that...

02:48.710 --> 02:50.712
I needed a fresh start.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.089
I know.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.551
Smile...

02:58.053 --> 02:59.805
Hey.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.265
Thank you.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.600
Let's go.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.941
Are you coming?

03:10.983 --> 03:13.068
I am, in, like, five minutes.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.736
Don't wanna be that kid, huh?

03:48.854 --> 03:50.271
Take our picture.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.858
Excuse me?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.693
You're a part of yearbook, right?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.028
How'd you know?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.654
Because your outfit reeks

03:57.696 --> 03:59.489
of second-hand boredom,

03:59.531 --> 04:01.783
and you're taking pictures of everyone.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.369
So you're either a stalker,
or a part of yearbook, but...

04:04.411 --> 04:06.747
either wouldn't surprise me.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.125
Oh, my God, just take the photo.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.212
Do we have to say cheese?
Just smile.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.505
Let me fix my hair.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.759
Done.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.973
Hmm. Now that's a piece of
meat worth biting into.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.226
Huh?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.686
Mr. Sumner, new English teacher.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.563
I give it two days before I have him

04:31.605 --> 04:33.732
wrapped around my little finger.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.944
All right, let's go.
These themes that we're

04:41.531 --> 04:43.700
talking about, folks,

04:43.742 --> 04:46.536
these ideas,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.371
they are timeless.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.416
That's why we're still reading this book...

04:51.458 --> 04:53.376
decades later.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.711
May I?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.797
Um, sorry, Mr. Sumner,

04:56.838 --> 04:58.506
I was just...

04:58.548 --> 05:00.341
checking in on a family emergency.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.136
Right, right, right, right.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.720
Well, please tell your
family the comment section

05:03.762 --> 05:05.555
on a social media post

05:05.597 --> 05:06.932
isn't the best place to communicate

05:06.974 --> 05:09.350
during an emergency.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.147
"Looking hot, bitches."

05:16.024 --> 05:17.442
Very poetic.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.696
You have music on there?
Yeah.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.406
So tell me a song from your playlist.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.160
Um... "Shape Of You."

05:26.201 --> 05:28.162
Ah, Ed Sheeran. Not a bad songwriter.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.498
But you can only go so far

05:31.539 --> 05:33.250
lyrically when writing a Top 20 hit.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.668
So, everyone, let's, uh,

05:34.709 --> 05:37.087
let's pull out our cell phones, please.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.463
Come on, pull 'em out.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.300
Now, pull up your song of the moment.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.219
And let's, uh, let's take a look.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.804
What you got?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.181
Rihanna.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.473
Really?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.017
All right.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.059
Bruno Mars.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.103
Yeah, I see, I see that.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.189
Miss Taylor Swift, yes.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.482
Big Shawn.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.400
Sorry, I do not know that one.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.113
Thank you for paying attention.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.785
Ah, yes.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.329
The Beatles.

06:10.369 --> 06:13.081
One of the best bands ever.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.791
If you can look past the
fact that they stole

06:14.833 --> 06:17.044
from every African-American artist

06:17.085 --> 06:19.254
from Chuck Berry to Bobby Parker.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.839
Uh, I think you're confusing

06:20.881 --> 06:23.758
inspiration for appropriation.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.011
No, they stole from every
band, and you know it.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.973
Uh, and everyone ripped
off the Beatles, and...

06:30.015 --> 06:31.474
Brahms ripped off Beethoven

06:31.516 --> 06:33.018
and Beethoven ripped off Mozart

06:33.060 --> 06:35.562
and you're ripping off every cool professor

06:35.603 --> 06:37.231
who's ever stepped foot in this classroom.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.107
Okay, okay, listen.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.650
Take it easy.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.485
Listen, the point I'm
trying to make is this.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.154
Not to sound too cliche,

06:44.196 --> 06:47.074
but I wanna be someone you can talk to.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.284
About anything.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.036
Anything?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.080
Yes, anything.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.457
Okay, I wanna broaden your horizons.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.543
Now, I remember what it's like to be young

06:58.585 --> 06:59.544
and not wanna care. You know what?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.089
That's cool.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.924
But in here...

07:03.965 --> 07:05.133
if we can create a space

07:05.175 --> 07:08.803
to just chill... and learn.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.224
And that's what I care about.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.643
All right, so I'll be
here every day at 7:30

07:15.685 --> 07:19.273
if you need help or if
you, you just wanna talk.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.067
What about... after school?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.484
Sure.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.615
All right, class, thank you.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.367
I have a good feeling we're all gonna get

07:30.409 --> 07:32.744
quite close this semester.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.458
Have a good day.
Bye.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.127
Good day. Thanks, man.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.133
Have a good day.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.427
Thanks.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.247
I'm sorry...

08:17.289 --> 08:19.374
did you reserve this or something?

08:19.416 --> 08:22.710
No, I'm just... usually
the only person in here.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.379
Oh.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.546
Heh. Okay.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.607
Can I help you?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.734
I saw you drawing in class.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.029
Is that your stuff?
No.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.657
Uh, my stuff is pretty much just bad.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.534
Is there such a thing as bad art?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.244
I mean... just look at me.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.955
I'm-I'm sketching Wonder Woman fan art.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.334
And Picasso was making masterful
oil paintings at nine.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.752
But no pressure, right?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.838
Well, age is just a number.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.719
I'm Kyla, by the way.
Uh, I'm Riley.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.637
Hi.
Hi.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.473
So I'm, uh...

09:16.515 --> 09:18.141
I'm guessing you're into art, too.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.019
Photography, mostly.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.355
So, uh, when did you move?

09:23.397 --> 09:26.566
Um, a few weeks ago.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.194
Yeah, my dad was looking for a fresh start.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.862
As he likes to put it.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.199
Which means that I got thrown
into a brand new school

09:34.241 --> 09:36.159
with a bunch of new people.

09:36.201 --> 09:40.163
Well, you met me, so, that's
one fewer new person.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.622
And really, who else do you need?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.339
I'll see if I can add your
picture to the yearbook.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.924
Yeah, sure, go for it.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.300
Uh, what's your last name?

09:52.342 --> 09:53.676
For the caption.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.597
Uh, S-Sumner.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.476
As in...? Please don't say anything.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.478
Having no one know me is so much better

10:03.520 --> 10:06.689
than having everyone know me as Mr.
Sumner's daughter.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.316
My lips are sealed.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.485
Thanks.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.655
Hey, um, not to take advantage, but, um...

10:14.697 --> 10:16.366
I think I might be needing some extra help

10:16.408 --> 10:18.201
in that class this semester.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.203
Do you think maybe we could study sometime?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.456
Uh...

10:22.497 --> 10:24.958
Yeah, sure, why not?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.960
Cool.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.342
So, how was your first day?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.801
You look like you survived.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.095
Well, as good as can be expected.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.518
Did you make any friends?

11:24.559 --> 11:27.604
Yeah, I did, actually.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.482
And she even stuck around
when she found out about you.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.318
Hm, so I'm your dirty little secret.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.861
Who was it?

11:34.902 --> 11:36.112
Kyla.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.405
Hm.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.823
The Beatles expert.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.534
Mm-hmm.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.701
She's sharp, that one.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.120
I'm a fan.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.664
Huh! Well, gosh.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.374
Thanks for your approval.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.083
See, I told you it'd get better.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.545
Dad, that was just the first day.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.254
But a good first day, it seems.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.589
Hmm?

12:07.561 --> 12:08.895
Mom?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.115
Mom!

12:21.157 --> 12:23.493
Hi! Hi, you're late.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.495
I was covering a basketball game.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.081
Come here, give me a hug.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.999
Maybe shower first.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.792
What are you doing in that thing anyways?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.336
You haven't gone on it in years.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.547
Not years.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.756
Okay, one year. Ha-ha-ha!

12:37.798 --> 12:39.050
So, what's the deal?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.678
Hot date?
Yeah, right.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.306
Hey, any envelopes of the large variety?

12:45.348 --> 12:48.351
You know... in the mail?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.228
Um, nope.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.356
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Maybe
if you would have applied

12:53.398 --> 12:56.484
to more than one school...

12:56.526 --> 12:58.861
Okay, sorry for only wanting the best.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.908
New dress?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.202
What's that?

13:06.244 --> 13:09.456
Oh, no. I found that in
the back of my closet.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.750
I'm just gonna see if it still fits.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.586
So, why is the tag still on it?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.463
Uh...

13:17.589 --> 13:18.923
Who is he?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.384
He's just a guy.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.595
It's not a big deal.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.514
It's not <i> not</i> a big deal, Mom.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.683
I was just gonna slip out.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.311
A.K.A. you're hiding this from me.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.688
You can trust me. I'm 18.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.148
I'm going off to college.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.650
Come on, I'm a big girl.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.901
You can tell me if you're dating again.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.069
All right.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.574
It's just a guy...

13:44.616 --> 13:46.159
I met at the grocery store.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.035
Is this your first time seeing him?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.248
Mom, details.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.083
You know me.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.586
Good things don't happen to me.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.130
Okay, I will tell you...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.591
when things become real.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.759
Okay?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.637
Okay.
All right, sweetie.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.643
Ky, are you in your room?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.609
Looks like you really
liked your old school.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.152
Yeah.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.279
Looks like you really
liked your friends, too.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.698
Do you miss 'em?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.199
Yeah, every day.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.118
I mean, we talk on the phone sometimes.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.413
But it's just not the same, you know?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.665
Boyfriend?
Kinda.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.710
The start of something maybe, I don't know.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.294
What about you?

15:21.379 --> 15:24.549
The boys here are just... boys.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.384
I don't wanna deal with that.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.887
If I'm gonna be in a
relationship with someone...

15:28.928 --> 15:31.639
I want it to be someone who's
mature enough to handle it.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.267
Wow, good luck
finding that in high school.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.894
Right?

15:37.353 --> 15:38.354
So...

15:38.396 --> 15:40.022
What about your dad?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.234
What about him?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.445
Well, is there a Mrs. Sumner?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.531
There... was.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.453
Um... I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.581
It's... the journalist in me,
always asking questions.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.998
No. Just forget I said anything.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.500
No, it's fine, really.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.919
Don't worry about it, it's...

16:01.961 --> 16:03.671
She was, uh...

16:03.713 --> 16:05.548
She was cheating...

16:05.590 --> 16:07.258
on my dad...

16:07.300 --> 16:10.720
for a really, really long time.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.555
I feel like I just pressured
you into sharing something

16:12.597 --> 16:16.016
you didn't want to.
No, it's, it's fine.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.561
Honestly, I...

16:18.603 --> 16:20.396
It's just that sometimes I just...

16:20.438 --> 16:22.816
I get so pissed at Dad

16:22.857 --> 16:24.484
for making me uproot my life,

16:24.525 --> 16:26.068
but saying it out loud like that

16:26.110 --> 16:28.446
actually helps me remember
that it's not his fault.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.239
You're really close with him, aren't you?

16:30.281 --> 16:34.619
No, I was always closer
with my mom, actually.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.456
Now, it's just Dad and me trying to...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.959
weather the storm together.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.169
Well, I think you're doing a good job.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.879
I mean, at least you guys both care.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.383
My dad left when I was six, so...

16:49.425 --> 16:51.970
I guess for him that was
enough time to decide

16:52.011 --> 16:53.972
I wasn't worth sticking around for.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.056
Wow.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.643
Well...

16:58.685 --> 17:00.561
Aren't we a pathetic bunch?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.106
You know, I'm really glad you found me

17:04.147 --> 17:05.942
in the corner of that computer room.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.944
I'm really glad I found you, too.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.320
Yeah, I think we should

17:10.363 --> 17:11.405
actually start working

17:11.446 --> 17:12.615
like we said we would.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.534
I guess so.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.410
I'm just gonna go to the
bathroom real quick.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.662
I'll be right back, okay?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.163
Do your thing.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.711
<i>Manhood.</i>

18:06.753 --> 18:08.546
<i>Womanhood.</i>

18:08.588 --> 18:10.297
Right? You hear the term...

18:12.091 --> 18:13.300
What do you feel?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.011
What do you think?

18:15.053 --> 18:16.888
What do you see?

18:18.138 --> 18:20.516
Oh, no, um...

18:20.558 --> 18:21.935
Mr. Sumner?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.477
Yes, Tricia, go ahead.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.354
My pencil broke.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.773
Could I borrow one of yours?

18:26.814 --> 18:30.150
Oh, hey, you can borrow... Ow! Ahem.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.072
Next time... bring a backup.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.367
I just don't really like
the idea of a backup.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.287
Why is that?

18:41.328 --> 18:42.705
Because I know what I want.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.250
And I never settle for second place.

18:48.086 --> 18:51.839
Well, that is a good attitude.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.507
But the people who fail to see the value

18:53.549 --> 18:56.928
in both preparedness and
the occasional loss...

18:56.970 --> 18:59.597
rarely reach their goals, hm?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.932
Anyone else?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.727
What are you looking at?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.193
Hey, you.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.572
Hi.
I'm Tricia.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.992
Although, I'm sure you
probably already know that.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.660
Yeah.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.704
So, you waiting on Dad?

19:23.746 --> 19:27.207
Or should I say Mr. Sumner?

19:27.249 --> 19:29.209
How do you know?
Please.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.920
I see you ride home with him every day.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.089
It's kind of obvious.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.175
But don't worry, your
secret is safe with me.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.971
You know...

19:40.013 --> 19:42.348
you're actually quite pretty.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.641
Maybe you shouldn't hide your face

19:43.683 --> 19:45.143
from the world so much.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.437
Was there something you needed?

19:48.479 --> 19:50.857
I was just gonna say you probably shouldn't

19:50.898 --> 19:52.900
hang around Kyla so much.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.276
What do you mean?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.903
I've just never seen her hang around

19:55.945 --> 19:57.697
with a guy before, that's all.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.448
Kyla and I are just friends.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.700
Good.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.909
Then you wouldn't mind being

20:01.951 --> 20:03.577
my shopping buddy tonight?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.580
So?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.082
What do you say?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.545
I guess.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.257
Great. See you later then?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.676
Bye.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.184
What the h...

20:26.225 --> 20:27.810
You scared the crap out of me.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.478
What the hell was that?

20:29.520 --> 20:31.313
And you ruined my drawing, thank you.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.982
Why were you talking to Tricia?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.316
What was she saying to you?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.027
Nothing, s-she was just asking me

20:36.069 --> 20:37.611
if I wanted to go shopping, that's all.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.279
I heard her mention my name.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.948
Were you spying on me?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.867
No, I was not spying on you, okay?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.160
I came over to say hello,

20:44.202 --> 20:46.079
and I saw you talking to Tricia.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.580
She's dangerous, Riley.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.415
How?

20:49.456 --> 20:50.958
Uh, well, for starters,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.002
she's very clearly obsessed with your dad.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.338
No, I think she's just
like that with everyone.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.132
No, I know her.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.467
This is different.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.344
Look, she's done this before.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.098
What do you mean?

21:05.139 --> 21:07.307
Last year, Tricia got really attached

21:07.349 --> 21:09.769
to one of our history teachers.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.106
They started meeting up
after school really often.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.649
Rumors started going around

21:15.691 --> 21:17.443
and they replaced him with a substitute

21:17.484 --> 21:19.528
for the rest of the year.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.405
We never were told why, but...

21:21.447 --> 21:23.783
I'm pretty sure Tricia had
something to do with it.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.325
I just...

21:25.367 --> 21:28.495
I don't want something
like that to happen again.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.915
Because I like you, and
it'd be pretty great

21:30.957 --> 21:32.708
if you could stick around.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.089
Thanks for the heads up.
Of course.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.257
That's what friends are for, right?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.591
Yeah.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.682
Hey, friend.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.851
When's your birthday?
Why?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.770
I'm filling out your yearbook profile.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.606
October 14th.
No way.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.483
Why? Do you have the same birthday as me?

21:57.524 --> 21:59.068
<i>'Cause that'd be too creepy.</i>

21:59.110 --> 22:01.612
October 18th, but close enough.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.698
Hm. Wow, so you're younger than I am.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.619
Uh, no, actually, I was held
back in elementary school.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.915
Are you gonna have a party?
I don't know.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.459
You have to, it's your 18th birthday.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.086
I went all out on mine.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.130
Can't remember a thing from that night.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.423
It's just that, I don't know anyone.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.010
Well, I could totally make a post

22:24.051 --> 22:25.427
for a party at your place.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.305
What?
Yeah.

22:27.345 --> 22:28.973
Advertise a little get together.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.725
Well, I thought you
didn't have any friends.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.060
It doesn't matter.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.270
Every bozo in our class

22:34.312 --> 22:35.813
will show up if you offer beer.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.066
My dad would never...

22:40.567 --> 22:43.487
You don't actually have to have beer.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.447
You just tell them you're going to.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.574
<i>Okay, that feels a bit hollow.</i>

22:47.616 --> 22:49.035
But you know what?

22:49.076 --> 22:50.494
It's kinda perfect too.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.080
I'm full of amazing ideas.

22:55.916 --> 23:00.213
Hey, uh, I just wanted to
apologize again about before.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.631
Oh, that's fine, don't worry about it.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.677
Does stuff like that
happen to your dad a lot?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.428
<i>People like Tricia?</i>

23:09.638 --> 23:12.474
I don't, I don't think so.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.268
I mean, he's just not that kinda guy.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.187
<i>You know?</i>

23:16.229 --> 23:18.898
<i>He always goes on to me
about moral high grounds</i>

23:18.939 --> 23:20.524
<i>and blah, blah, blah.</i>

23:21.525 --> 23:23.069
Also...

23:23.110 --> 23:24.695
Apparently he's seeing someone.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.031
That was quick. <i>I know.</i>

23:27.073 --> 23:29.449
<i>Apparently he met her at the grocery store.</i>

23:33.204 --> 23:35.289
Uh, I gotta go. <i>Kyla?</i>

23:37.166 --> 23:38.251
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

23:38.292 --> 23:40.044
Is this him?
Kyla!

23:44.590 --> 23:45.841
Mr. Sumner.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.343
Um, Kyla.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.512
You're here for Jess?

23:50.554 --> 23:52.139
Oh, uh, your mother...

23:52.181 --> 23:53.849
I presume, yes.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.018
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just let the man in. Hi.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.480
Wow, you are radiant.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.648
Thank you.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.401
You're gonna make me blush.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.403
Oh, I, I doubt that.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.074
Oh, sorry, so you met Kyla.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.867
My daughter.
Yes.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.245
Uh, Kyla is in my English class.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.080
Wait...

24:16.122 --> 24:17.415
Is this too weird?

24:17.455 --> 24:19.541
Are you... okay with this?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.129
I'll manage.

24:23.170 --> 24:26.757
All right, um, sorry,
uh, these are for you.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.050
Oh, thank you.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.010
They're beautiful, thanks.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.929
Yeah.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.432
Oh, do you wanna get a vase, honey?

24:34.472 --> 24:35.433
Um, yeah.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.850
Okay.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.274
Wow.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.984
You have a, a beautiful home.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.484
Thanks.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.569
Yeah.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.740
What?
Oh, my God.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.034
What's, what's funny?

24:54.076 --> 24:56.996
When you talked about being a teacher,

24:57.037 --> 25:00.416
I just didn't think about you
being a high school teacher.

25:00.458 --> 25:03.543
And how is that funny?
Sorry. I don't know.

25:03.585 --> 25:07.047
I just, I never had a
handsome English teacher...

25:07.089 --> 25:09.133
like you, when I went to school, so...

25:09.175 --> 25:10.092
Thank you.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.052
Oh.
Oh, Kyla.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.887
Wow.
I'm so sorry.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.597
Kyla!
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.641
I am... No, don't, don't worry.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.768
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.
It's, it's, it's just cotton.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.020
It's...

25:21.061 --> 25:22.604
I-I'm sorry.
Oh, uh... Yeah.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.940
I am sorry, I'll get that.
Sorry.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.109
Please...

25:27.151 --> 25:29.527
Oh, man.
Are we late?

25:29.569 --> 25:32.614
No, it's fine, I-I just don't
exactly have a, a backup shirt.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.074
So...
I know.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.533
Oh, um...
Gosh, um...

25:35.575 --> 25:36.785
I mean...

25:36.827 --> 25:38.578
You guys could do your date here.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.915
Hmm. There is an idea, huh?

25:41.957 --> 25:44.626
Yeah, I mean, uh, I could
help you cook something.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.338
Or I could just hang out in my room.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.174
No way, come on. Join us.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.009
That's, I mean... Is that... Yeah?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.387
That's a great idea. I
mean, I can help too.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.264
I'm not exactly horrible
with a spatula, you know?

25:57.306 --> 25:59.433
Wonderful, good.
Thanks.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.227
Why don't you just see what
we have in the kitchen?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.728
Okay? 'Cause I don't know.
Okay.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.938
So, and I have an extra shirt upstairs.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.899
Yeah?
If you wanna...

26:06.940 --> 26:09.402
Sure. Please, lead the way.
Sure.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.246
Then I just read that 80% of fitness

26:20.287 --> 26:22.373
is what comes out of the kitchen, so...

26:22.415 --> 26:24.833
I have decided to cut down on my baking.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.335
Eighty percent?

26:26.377 --> 26:27.503
That seems kinda high.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.962
I mean, you can have a cookie

26:29.004 --> 26:30.548
every now and then, right?

26:30.588 --> 26:31.965
Well, I do bake the
meanest white chocolate

26:33.426 --> 26:34.885
macadamia nut cookie

26:34.927 --> 26:36.136
you've ever eaten.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.347
Okay.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.893
Hey. Ky.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.354
Is there something that you
would like to share with us?

26:45.396 --> 26:47.731
Hm?
Hey, that is my line.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.943
It is?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.152
Sorry.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.488
Hey, how is Frost

26:54.530 --> 26:56.323
stacking up with your old school?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.576
It's great, smart kids...

26:58.616 --> 27:00.202
teachers are good.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.871
But teaching's been a piece of cake.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.081
I mean, to be honest.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.459
Wow, you are so humble.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.586
No, what I mean is,

27:08.626 --> 27:10.254
uh, teaching's always been like

27:10.296 --> 27:13.173
a hobby compared to
raising Riley on my own.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.592
Oh, that's nice.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.303
A-and I see the same fire in Kyla.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.764
I'm so happy the two of you
are becoming close friends.

27:20.806 --> 27:24.351
So, um, where are you going to school?

27:24.393 --> 27:27.938
Well, I applied to Emerson,
for journalism, technically,

27:27.980 --> 27:30.857
but ideally, I would like to pair that

27:30.899 --> 27:32.568
with my passion for photography.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.653
That's right. I always see
you with that camera.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.615
You see me?

27:37.655 --> 27:41.327
Uh, yeah, on campus, taking
pictures of everyone.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.413
That is so
awesome, about Emerson.

27:44.455 --> 27:48.125
Emerson is the only
place that she applied.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.418
Mom.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.586
There's a word

27:50.628 --> 27:52.588
for that kind of overconfidence.

27:53.671 --> 27:55.215
Is that true?

27:56.883 --> 27:58.718
I know what I want.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.762
So it seems.

28:02.889 --> 28:06.226
Uh, Jess, that was terrific.
Mmm.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.021
An impromptu meal
whipped up from scratch?

28:09.062 --> 28:10.939
Are you sure you don't
do this professionally?

28:10.981 --> 28:13.526
Oh, now you're just flattering me.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.777
I... Plus, I had two excellent sous-chefs.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.154
No, no, don't be modest.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.157
I mean, I could eat that... every day.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.699
I'm serious.

28:21.741 --> 28:22.826
Where do you think
these compliments

28:22.868 --> 28:24.286
are gonna get you?

28:24.328 --> 28:26.163
I don't know.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.416
But I can't wait to find out.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.378
All right, um, I'm gonna
go finish my homework.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.131
Okay, honey.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.344
Okay. Good night.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.137
Good night.
Yeah, um...

29:05.327 --> 29:07.120
Kyla, what is wrong?

29:07.162 --> 29:08.788
There's someone outside my window.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.541
Oh, my God. Are you sure?
What?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.959
I was changing, and I saw
someone outside watching me.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.378
All right, just, just wait here, okay?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.213
I'll be right back. Just... Okay.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.631
Come here, sweetheart.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.799
You're safe, come on.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.843
Okay. Are you okay?

29:21.885 --> 29:23.512
I'm shaking. I don't know who it was.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.305
I know, so what happened?
I don't know.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.683
I was changing, I saw someone, and...

29:27.725 --> 29:29.727
They were just watching me.
Oh...

29:32.229 --> 29:34.440
Well, whoever it
was, they're gone now.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.858
Did you see who it was? No.
We should call the police.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.611
No. We don't have to do that.
I...

29:38.652 --> 29:40.195
Yeah, I think we should.
Please.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.155
I really don't wanna make
a big deal about this.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.199
Now, this is a big deal, okay?
If someone's spying on you...

29:44.241 --> 29:46.452
There's nothing we can
even tell the police.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.412
I didn't even see who it was.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.747
No, we-we should do something.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.665
I agree.
Uh, maybe...

29:51.707 --> 29:54.251
I could just hang out here with you guys.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.422
Of course. I mean, I
don't wanna intrude.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.633
No.
Come on, that's nonsense.

30:00.674 --> 30:01.967
Let's sit down.
Okay.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.594
Okay, I'll go make some tea.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.053
Okay.
Okay?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.017
You sure you don't mind?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.312
Yeah. No, I don't mind.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.688
Thank you for checking outside.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.316
Yeah, of course.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.777
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.987
I wanna stay.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.989
Good. Good.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.325
Besides, Riley, she's out with
her friend tonight, so it's...

30:26.366 --> 30:27.867
Oh, who?

30:27.909 --> 30:29.745
Uh, Tricia from school.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.414
Okay, so...

30:32.456 --> 30:34.040
Oh.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.375
Cards?

30:36.585 --> 30:38.754
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, cards.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.305
Uh...
Oh, um...

30:48.347 --> 30:50.349
Whoa.
Um, sorry.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.184
Yeah. Yeah.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.773
Hey, good morning, sweetie.
Hey.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.817
Hey, I told Chris he could use your shower.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.109
I hope you don't mind. No, not at all.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.112
Okay.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.905
Did you make him breakfast, too?

31:05.947 --> 31:07.282
Mm-hmm.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.450
You really like him, don't you?

31:08.492 --> 31:10.577
Do you?

31:10.619 --> 31:12.078
Yeah?

31:12.120 --> 31:14.623
Wow, this looks amazing.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.333
What a masterpiece, Chef Jess?

31:16.375 --> 31:18.335
Good morning.
Good morning.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.919
Mmm. Yeah.
For me?

31:19.961 --> 31:22.339
Mine?
Yes.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.590
Hey, honey, I need to get gas

31:23.632 --> 31:24.800
on the way I take you to school.

31:24.842 --> 31:26.468
So, will you eat fast?
Mm-hmm.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.470
Uh, don't be silly, Kyla can ride with me.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.889
I'm going to school, anyway, so...

31:30.930 --> 31:32.140
Right.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.035
So, um, about this morning...

31:52.077 --> 31:54.621
Don't worry about it, okay?

31:54.663 --> 31:57.708
It's not the first time
I've seen a naked man.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.126
I just hope the water
pressure was adequate.

32:01.545 --> 32:06.091
So, um, tell me about, um, photojournalism.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.385
Well, not much to tell, really,

32:08.427 --> 32:10.345
I just, uh...

32:10.387 --> 32:12.013
I love observing people.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.266
You can tell a lot about someone

32:14.307 --> 32:16.017
when they think no one's watching.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.144
So, what can you tell about me?

32:18.186 --> 32:20.146
You're assuming that I observe you?

32:20.188 --> 32:22.357
Am I assuming too much? Sorry.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.777
Perhaps.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.783
One school, though.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.576
That is a bold move

32:32.618 --> 32:34.327
and, and very risky.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.331
I can tell that you're a
great student, but...

32:38.373 --> 32:40.208
finishing high school without
a contingency plan...

32:40.250 --> 32:41.460
I got in.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.463
That's, that's incredible.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.424
And you haven't told your mom yet.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.176
I'm waiting for the right time.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.096
She hasn't really dealt with
the idea of me leaving yet.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.307
Being alone.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.185
She doesn't see how grown up I've become.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.272
Well, I can see it.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.528
Hi.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.905
Hey.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.911
Who died?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.840
Hey.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.216
You weren't that the computer lab.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.177
You okay?
I'm fine.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.641
Are you mad at me, or something?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.142
Why would I be mad at you?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.853
I-I-I don't know.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.229
Oh, how was hanging out with Tricia?

33:43.271 --> 33:45.899
Heard you guys went out.
This is what this is...

33:45.941 --> 33:49.695
After I specifically told
you to stay away from her.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.571
She's using you, Riley.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.114
Using you to get to Chris.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.367
Chris?

33:55.408 --> 33:57.160
You mean Mr. Sumner?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.495
Whatever.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.914
Well, that's interesting, because, uh,

34:00.956 --> 34:02.040
well, she came over last night

34:02.081 --> 34:03.416
to pick me up.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.043
And then she said it was you

34:05.084 --> 34:08.045
who was messing around
with that history teacher.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.214
And you believed her?

34:09.255 --> 34:11.800
She had some pretty good points.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.760
One of them being the fact that

34:13.802 --> 34:16.179
she wasn't even in his history class.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.806
Well, she's lying to you.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.391
And she says you're lying.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.100
Look, you can pick whatever side you want,

34:21.141 --> 34:23.061
but it's pretty clear
you've made your mind up.

34:23.101 --> 34:24.646
Look, I didn't come here for a fight...

34:24.688 --> 34:26.773
So, why did you come here?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.608
Actually, I have a lot of work
to do, so if you don't mind,

34:28.650 --> 34:31.319
you can take your poor
judgment somewhere else.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.196
Well, you've got a mean streak.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.697
Enjoy the dark.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.748
So, what's that scar from on your arm?

34:42.789 --> 34:44.248
When I was five...

34:44.290 --> 34:46.167
Oh, yeah? What were you doing in the truck?

34:46.208 --> 34:48.045
I was just...

34:48.085 --> 34:50.295
Oh, look, it's Miss Yearbook.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.757
Ow!

34:51.797 --> 34:53.592
What's your problem?

34:53.632 --> 34:55.677
Stay away from Riley.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.303
Jealous much?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.305
What, are you afraid I'll
take her away from you

34:59.347 --> 35:02.141
and you'll go back to being the
sad, little loner that you are?

35:03.435 --> 35:05.812
I will end you.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.230
Why are you so upset?

35:07.272 --> 35:09.274
I'm the one who should be pissed.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.651
Spreading rumors about me.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.156
Yeah, keep walking, stalker.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.952
Hey, I... Kyla...

36:01.994 --> 36:03.870
If you're here to accuse me of lying again,

36:03.912 --> 36:06.331
I'm really not in the mood, so, just...
leave me alone.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.291
I'm not, I'm...

36:08.333 --> 36:09.668
Oh!

36:12.045 --> 36:14.255
Oh, my God. Kyla, what is this?

36:14.297 --> 36:16.008
What... Hey!

36:16.049 --> 36:18.510
What are... What is this? Kyla, what...

36:21.471 --> 36:22.973
Kyla...

36:24.599 --> 36:25.934
Kyla?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.939
Yeah!

36:35.861 --> 36:38.071
Kyla, what's wrong?

36:38.113 --> 36:41.033
I'm so sick of high school
and this petty drama.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.701
Oh, well...

36:43.994 --> 36:46.788
Hey, I'm gonna find who did this, okay?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.582
All right.
Okay.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.920
All right?

37:01.469 --> 37:02.804
Hey.
You know what?

37:02.846 --> 37:04.222
I am going into that school

37:04.263 --> 37:05.932
tomorrow, and I'm gonna demand

37:05.974 --> 37:08.309
that they do an investigation.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.062
They're already looking into it, Mom.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.773
So, you know I'm here for you, right?

37:13.815 --> 37:15.316
I mean, for anything.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.360
Everything.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.445
I know. I know, Mom.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.949
So, what about those pictures, Kyla?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.745
I don't know, they were just...

37:26.786 --> 37:28.747
for me, okay?

37:30.123 --> 37:31.708
I don't know how anyone got a hold of them,

37:31.750 --> 37:34.086
and I don't really wanna think about it.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.421
All right.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.425
Well, I just wanna make sure

37:40.466 --> 37:42.052
that you are not getting

37:42.094 --> 37:44.345
taken advantage of, okay?

37:44.387 --> 37:46.806
I'm not, trust me.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.558
After that whole thing
that happened last year...

37:48.600 --> 37:51.895
Mom. Mom. Believe me, okay?

37:51.937 --> 37:54.439
No one is taking advantage of me.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.690
You don't have to worry.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.358
Well, that is my job.
Hm.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.861
I worry.
Mm-hmm.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.614
Boy, you're growing up, huh?

38:02.655 --> 38:03.907
All right, so how about some good news?

38:03.949 --> 38:05.825
Did we get any mail today?

38:05.867 --> 38:07.953
I got into Emerson.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.495
Oh, my God!

38:09.537 --> 38:12.832
I'm so... Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

38:12.874 --> 38:14.542
Oh, my God! You... Come here.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.586
Oh, my...

38:16.628 --> 38:18.088
So, you're not sad?

38:18.130 --> 38:21.466
Well, I... Of course I'm gonna be sad.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.384
But you know, you doing what you love,

38:23.426 --> 38:25.053
that's what makes me happy.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.182
Besides, I'm not gonna be totally alone.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.851
I mean, I've got Chris.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.395
Don't you think, maybe you guys

38:34.437 --> 38:35.939
are moving too fast?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.066
I don't know.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.442
Can you just promise me

38:39.484 --> 38:40.819
if anything sketchy comes up,

38:40.860 --> 38:42.570
you won't just ignore it?

38:42.612 --> 38:44.281
Okay.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.657
I promise.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.117
Thank you.
Oh, my God.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.119
Congratulations, honey!
Thanks.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.459
Oh, um...

38:56.501 --> 38:57.877
I can go somewhere else.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.629
No, uh, wait.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.299
I think I owe you an apology.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.099
Listen, I...

39:11.141 --> 39:13.351
I was seeing Tricia...

39:13.392 --> 39:14.686
being so forward with my dad

39:14.727 --> 39:16.771
and getting so wrapped up in it

39:16.813 --> 39:18.190
that I just...

39:18.231 --> 39:19.858
I just started getting paranoid, and...

39:19.899 --> 39:21.318
and then I remembered what you were saying

39:21.359 --> 39:22.277
about your own dad, and I just...

39:22.319 --> 39:23.528
Look, I, I'm sorry,

39:23.569 --> 39:25.905
I put you in that position.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.533
It's just that, Chris...

39:28.574 --> 39:30.202
Mr. Sumner...

39:30.243 --> 39:32.495
he's the first guy my mom
has dated in ten years

39:32.537 --> 39:34.247
who's been somewhat decent.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.916
He's kind to her, and considerate, and...

39:38.084 --> 39:40.753
It's just not something I'm used to.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.755
And I'm sorry I got so attached to that.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.216
I don't have to be.
No, no.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.384
You shouldn't be apologizing for that.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.012
I'm the one who's sorry.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.099
Are we okay?

39:53.141 --> 39:54.600
I think so.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.772
So, um, about those pictures...

39:59.814 --> 40:01.816
You don't have to explain.
No.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.193
I want to.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.986
I want you to know.

40:05.028 --> 40:08.073
Last year, with that history teacher,

40:08.114 --> 40:09.699
that was me.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.202
He made me feel special, and...

40:12.244 --> 40:14.162
I took those pictures for him, but...

40:14.204 --> 40:16.706
I realized that it was
wrong, and I reported it.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.416
I just...

40:18.457 --> 40:20.543
I don't know who got a
hold of those pictures.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.254
I mean, my guess would be Tricia...

40:22.295 --> 40:23.922
No one deserves that.

40:26.632 --> 40:27.967
Especially, not you.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.180
I know I've only known you
for a short amount of time,

40:32.222 --> 40:35.892
but I think you might be the
best friend I've ever had.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.823
Hey, Kyla.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.533
Hi.
Hey, need a ride?

40:52.575 --> 40:54.911
Yeah, actually. Is Riley coming?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.996
Uh, no, she's got an after-school project,

40:57.038 --> 41:00.166
but I'm heading home, if
you wanna catch a lift.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.710
Yeah, that'd be great.
Great.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.421
All right.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.671
How was school?

41:05.713 --> 41:07.840
Um, school, you know...

41:16.433 --> 41:18.143
Oh...
Whoa!

41:18.184 --> 41:20.895
What are you doing?
Just sit still.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.651
For the yearbook.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.736
Oh, poor yearbook.

41:30.155 --> 41:33.574
Well, thank you for the ride, Mr. Sumner.

41:33.616 --> 41:37.287
Uh, please, just call me Chris.
Chris.

41:37.329 --> 41:39.789
So, I will see you later tonight?

41:40.957 --> 41:42.250
Uh, yeah?
Yeah.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.127
I'm seeing your mom later, so...

41:45.211 --> 41:46.338
Right.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.425
All right, well, uh, thank you again.

41:50.467 --> 41:51.968
You're welcome.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.719
Please tell your mom I said hello.

41:53.761 --> 41:54.929
I will.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.515
Oh, and, uh, please

41:57.556 --> 41:59.225
finish reading chapter ten.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.601
I'm looking forward to it.

42:00.643 --> 42:03.188
I know you are. Ha, ha.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.563
Bye.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.688
Hey, I'm heading out.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.065
Okay.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.984
So, uh...

42:50.026 --> 42:51.569
How is everything, hm?

42:51.610 --> 42:52.987
Look, I know I was nervous

42:53.029 --> 42:54.322
about the move and everything.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.158
Nervous? Well...
Okay.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.701
Upset.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.954
But you, uh, you were right.

43:01.996 --> 43:05.166
I was a little resentful and...

43:05.208 --> 43:07.585
It was, it was not fair to you.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.504
You know?

43:09.546 --> 43:10.963
I just want you to know that...

43:12.006 --> 43:13.591
I appreciate you.

43:13.632 --> 43:15.468
I know you do.

43:21.182 --> 43:22.392
Is Chris here?

43:22.434 --> 43:23.393
In the bathroom.

43:25.228 --> 43:26.854
Is this his?

43:26.896 --> 43:28.356
Uh, yep.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.402
Why is he getting text from Tricia?

43:33.945 --> 43:35.738
Mom, you have to read it.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.116
Mm-mm.
You promised.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.286
Okay, fine, then I will.

43:41.327 --> 43:42.995
Okay, fine.

43:45.164 --> 43:49.961
"I want you to watch me touch
myself under my desk."

43:50.002 --> 43:53.423
Oh, hey, beautiful, you ready?

43:53.465 --> 43:55.550
We should go, we're just, uh...

43:55.592 --> 43:57.676
Whoa. What?

43:59.596 --> 44:00.763
What?

44:00.805 --> 44:02.474
Jess.
What?

44:02.515 --> 44:04.142
What're you even talking about?
I don't know.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.726
What's going on
in your phone here, huh?

44:05.768 --> 44:08.146
I've never texted a student in my life.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.106
Okay?
Oh, okay.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.108
I don't know how
she got my number.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.110
Is that Tricia Wilson?
Yes.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.695
Wait, she's the
same age as Riley.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.615
Wow, I hope you get fired.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.366
You don't even know what
you're talking about, okay?

44:20.408 --> 44:21.742
Have you actually fooled around

44:21.784 --> 44:22.994
with any of your students?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.412
Do you hear yourself?

44:24.454 --> 44:26.164
Asking me these questions?
Do I...

44:26.205 --> 44:27.832
Of course I haven't
fooled around with them.

44:27.873 --> 44:29.542
I've never touched a
student in my life, okay?

44:29.584 --> 44:31.919
Okay, you need to leave,
and you need to leave now.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.421
Jess. Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess.
Just go.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.298
No, no, no, I'm done.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.927
This is not what you think it is.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.304
Uh-huh.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.964
So, listen, I'm sorry.

45:17.006 --> 45:18.466
I really wanted this to work,

45:18.508 --> 45:20.051
with your mom.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.178
Did you lie?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.096
No, I've never touched Tricia.

45:25.431 --> 45:27.099
Has she texted you before?

45:27.141 --> 45:28.393
Kyla.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.103
Did you lie?

45:31.145 --> 45:33.856
Yeah, okay, she texted
me before, all right?

45:33.898 --> 45:35.816
But I never texted back.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.945
You just felt nice to
be talked to that way?

45:41.822 --> 45:42.948
Kyla.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.951
You spent almost

45:45.993 --> 45:49.205
every minute of the last 18 years...

45:49.247 --> 45:50.206
Kyla.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.874
...being a husband.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.419
Parent.

45:55.503 --> 45:57.004
Teacher.

45:57.046 --> 45:59.507
When do you get to just be a man?

45:59.549 --> 46:01.133
Kyla, listen...

46:01.175 --> 46:03.344
Just... Hey, hey, what are you doing?

46:03.386 --> 46:04.929
Just...

46:04.970 --> 46:06.931
When do you get what you want, and...

46:08.140 --> 46:11.477
not have to feel bad about it? Hmm?

46:11.519 --> 46:12.895
We should probably just...

46:17.942 --> 46:19.611
Your mom is...

46:26.200 --> 46:28.453
Listen, you should just, just get off...

46:28.494 --> 46:31.372
Shh. It's okay.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.557
Consider that my thesis statement.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.859
Mr. Sumner.
Yeah.

48:22.899 --> 48:24.652
Mr. Sumner, um...

48:24.694 --> 48:27.446
I have a question
on number eight.

48:27.488 --> 48:30.449
I was just really struggling
with number eight.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.868
Mm-hmm? I don't know, it's like...

48:31.908 --> 48:33.369
you're asking here...

48:33.411 --> 48:36.455
Well, yeah, that really changes things.

48:41.878 --> 48:44.463
Hey, are you having trouble
with number eight as well?

48:44.505 --> 48:47.592
Uh, no, I finished 15 minutes ago.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.969
You left this at my house.

49:13.868 --> 49:17.789
Focus on your test, please.
What's going on?

49:17.830 --> 49:19.457
One of the students
from your class.

49:19.498 --> 49:20.792
Which one?

49:20.833 --> 49:23.252
Tricia?
Is everything okay?

49:23.294 --> 49:24.545
Yeah, okay.

49:24.587 --> 49:25.713
Yeah.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.968
Tricia, I need you to get up, please?

49:32.010 --> 49:33.471
Why?

49:33.512 --> 49:36.014
Just grab your things, and let's go, now.

49:54.826 --> 49:57.119
I don't know
where you're taking me.

50:00.414 --> 50:02.625
Let's get these tests finished.
Focus, please.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.130
Test's over, please, face down.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.214
Thank you.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.550
Good luck.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.597
I have no idea.

50:16.639 --> 50:18.891
Um, I'll see you later, okay?

50:18.933 --> 50:20.100
Thanks.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.279
Are you okay?

50:32.321 --> 50:34.573
I-I just don't know what to do.

50:34.615 --> 50:36.450
About my mom? Yeah.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.872
Maybe you two just weren't meant to be.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.208
Maybe you found someone better.

50:45.877 --> 50:47.085
What are you doing?

51:06.438 --> 51:08.190
So, I guess they found something on Tricia.

51:08.232 --> 51:09.567
Seems like it.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.986
I wonder what they'll do to her.

51:12.028 --> 51:14.070
It's not our problem anymore, right?

51:15.322 --> 51:18.074
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

51:18.116 --> 51:20.452
See you at the party.
Yeah.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.456
You're really friends with that turd?

51:24.498 --> 51:26.458
Quentin's not a turd.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.627
Okay, I kinda like those guys too.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.588
You're seriously defending them?

51:30.629 --> 51:31.923
Have you learned nothing?

51:31.964 --> 51:34.132
Oh, my God, Kyla, just let it go.

51:34.174 --> 51:36.677
You're not my only friend, okay?

51:36.719 --> 51:38.387
Okay, sorry.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.348
Okay.
Bye.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.108
Hey, Mom.

51:52.150 --> 51:54.612
I'm heading off to Riley's party.

51:54.653 --> 51:55.696
It smells good in here.

51:55.738 --> 51:57.406
Yeah, stress-baked

51:57.448 --> 51:58.950
a huge batch of cookies.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.785
You wanna take some?
No, thanks.

52:00.826 --> 52:03.079
What happened to the fitness regimen?

52:03.119 --> 52:04.455
I don't know what I'm thinking.

52:04.496 --> 52:06.874
I mean, seriously, a 42-year-old

52:06.916 --> 52:08.667
single, divorced mother.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.837
How can I compare to a Tricia Wilson?

52:11.879 --> 52:13.965
Don't compare yourself to her.

52:14.006 --> 52:16.174
She's disgusting.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.260
Besides, she was hauled
in for sign today, so...

52:18.302 --> 52:20.345
Yeah, do you know why she got in trouble?

52:20.387 --> 52:22.138
I do.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.767
They found a broken phone in her locker.

52:24.809 --> 52:27.645
Those pictures of you were on it.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.647
She did that.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.982
Your principal called me

52:31.023 --> 52:33.191
asking me what I wanted to have done.

52:33.233 --> 52:34.735
I was like, "Well, let her have it."

52:34.777 --> 52:36.528
Wow.
Good riddance!

52:36.570 --> 52:38.154
Don't worry about it.

52:38.196 --> 52:40.365
You're gonna find someone
better than him, okay?

52:40.407 --> 52:41.533
I know it.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.911
Thank you, sweetie.

52:43.953 --> 52:45.955
Uh, do you want me to stay
and hang out for a while?

52:45.997 --> 52:48.958
No, I do not. You go on,
and have fun with Riley.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.918
Okay. Text me if you need anything.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.503
Okay, sweetie. Love you.
Bye.

52:52.544 --> 52:53.671
Love you.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.385
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's up?

53:00.427 --> 53:02.596
Thanks for coming, enjoy the party.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.808
Hi.

53:05.850 --> 53:06.809
Hey.

53:06.851 --> 53:08.352
Aw, thank you.

53:09.269 --> 53:10.688
You're so sweet.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.274
Now, look who's here.

53:14.316 --> 53:15.442
Wow.

53:15.484 --> 53:16.986
Hi.
Oh, my God.

53:17.028 --> 53:18.654
This is all because of you.
Are you drunk?

53:18.696 --> 53:20.322
No.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.658
Come on, it's still my dad's place.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.077
Um, well, here.
What?

53:25.119 --> 53:26.328
Where did that come from?

53:26.370 --> 53:27.788
Just open it.

53:31.207 --> 53:32.918
Oh, my God, Kyla.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.838
You shouldn't have.
But I did.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.339
Thank you.
You're welcome.

53:37.381 --> 53:38.883
That is so sweet.

53:42.761 --> 53:46.140
Uh... This is for you.

53:47.808 --> 53:51.269
What? No one should turn 18 sober.

53:51.311 --> 53:52.897
Just, uh, keep it for yourself, okay?

53:52.938 --> 53:54.815
Oh, yeah, you, uh, you betcha.

53:54.857 --> 53:56.441
It's my birthday. Mm-hmm.
Oh, okay.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.152
Uh, I'm gonna go inside for a little bit.

53:58.194 --> 53:59.987
And I'll see you soon.
All right, see you later.

54:00.029 --> 54:01.237
Okay.

54:25.137 --> 54:26.597
Hey.
Hey.

54:26.638 --> 54:28.306
What are you doing up here?

54:28.348 --> 54:30.101
Just wanted to say hi.

54:31.143 --> 54:32.603
You work too hard.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.776
Yeah, I just want to be alone.

54:38.817 --> 54:41.779
I'm messing up with your mom.
You didn't mess anything up.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.322
Yes, I did.

54:44.364 --> 54:46.450
Not from my point of view.

54:47.367 --> 54:50.079
Kyla, stop, I just...

54:50.121 --> 54:52.039
I'm not in a good mood right now.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.917
Let me make you feel better.

54:59.755 --> 55:02.216
Don't you want to be
outside with your friends?

55:03.341 --> 55:05.427
They're not my friends.

55:11.391 --> 55:15.229
My daughter... Is currently preoccupied.

55:18.565 --> 55:20.358
Look, this is too much, all right?

55:20.400 --> 55:22.318
You-you-you need to leave.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.702
Am I gonna have to repeat myself?

55:33.538 --> 55:34.957
Mind says no.

55:50.264 --> 55:51.765
We can't do this.

55:51.807 --> 55:53.642
No.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.602
We shouldn't do this.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.688
There's a difference.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.026
Be a man.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.358
Dad?

56:45.610 --> 56:47.363
Are you kidding me?

56:47.403 --> 56:48.739
Are you f...

56:48.780 --> 56:49.865
Dad, what the hell?

56:49.907 --> 56:51.033
Riley.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.285
Nice. Real nice.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.329
Riley, wait, hey!

56:55.371 --> 56:56.830
Riley, wait!

57:01.710 --> 57:03.503
Riley. Riley!

57:05.130 --> 57:06.757
Riley.

57:06.798 --> 57:08.259
Riley, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

57:08.300 --> 57:11.053
She's the only friend I have, okay?

57:11.095 --> 57:14.430
Or had. Great. Why her?

57:14.472 --> 57:16.016
I didn't mean for this to happen, okay?

57:16.058 --> 57:17.684
But I swear to you, I swear, that's it.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.061
It is over.

57:19.103 --> 57:20.687
You were the one who moved me.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.522
You call this a fresh start?

57:23.941 --> 57:26.026
Have you been drinking?
What?

57:26.068 --> 57:28.987
Are you drinking? Don't
you dare turn this on me.

57:29.029 --> 57:30.572
There's a big difference between what I did

57:30.614 --> 57:31.990
and what you're doing, okay?

57:32.032 --> 57:33.658
Riley. Wait!

57:39.915 --> 57:41.792
Go home!

57:41.833 --> 57:43.252
Now!

58:07.484 --> 58:09.486
Where are you going?

58:09.527 --> 58:11.989
Look, it's fine. She's probably just drunk.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.117
What?

58:15.159 --> 58:16.368
I thought you knew.

58:17.453 --> 58:19.330
You thought I knew what?

58:19.371 --> 58:21.790
About Riley's drinking problem.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.583
I've been trying to get her to see someone,

58:23.625 --> 58:25.961
but she just won't listen to me.

58:26.003 --> 58:28.464
So, she's been doing this for a while?

58:28.505 --> 58:31.216
As long as I've known her.

58:31.258 --> 58:33.677
I need to find her.
Look, just stay.

58:33.718 --> 58:35.971
She'll come back.

58:36.013 --> 58:39.141
In the meantime, we have the
house all to ourselves.

58:39.183 --> 58:41.393
What do you say, we pick
up where we left off?

58:41.435 --> 58:43.145
Do you know how insane that sounds?

58:43.187 --> 58:46.440
You're my student. Oh,
please, you wanted it.

58:46.482 --> 58:48.066
I'm not letting you go that easy.

58:48.108 --> 58:49.985
What are you saying? Are
you threatening me?

58:50.027 --> 58:52.488
Need I remind you who didn't ask my age?

58:53.780 --> 58:57.075
Oh, pick up the jaw, sugar. I'm legal.

58:57.993 --> 58:59.495
Please.

58:59.536 --> 59:02.247
Stay.
Riley needs me.

59:02.289 --> 59:04.333
Are you saying she's more
important than I am?

59:04.375 --> 59:06.251
Of course she's more important than you.

59:31.276 --> 59:34.405
You are not taking him away from me.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.934
Riley.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.227
Riley, stop, please, just...

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.771
I have nothing to say to you, okay?

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.190
Are you okay?
Do not touch me.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:11.816
Let me explain.
I said no!

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.485
Get away from me.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.658
Bradbury further cemented
his literary mastery

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.702
with a series of shorts,

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.205
each one displaying a balanced tone

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.916
of fervent optimism and fear...

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.460
as you know.

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:32.754
So, anyone care to share their take

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.924
on any of the approved Bradbury shorts?

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:40.220
Anyone? Speak.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:45.100
Kyla.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.852
I read Ray Bradbury's "The Fog Horn."

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.605
A bit obvious.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.566
But first thoughts?

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:55.819
Well, it's a story about isolation,

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.779
wonder...

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.657
forlorn history... lust.

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:03.494
Well, I'm glad you picked up
on the inherent loneliness...

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.329
Of course.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.915
A slick creature looking for one last mate.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.418
Looking for one...
Sorry.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.295
You didn't let me finish.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.130
I'm glad you picked up on the loneliness.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:18.675
Ah, but you're ignoring the
deep themes of mystery

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:20.802
and unified empathy,

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.389
in order to focus on a shallow, sleek

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.600
and easy interpretation.

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:29.269
I hope in your next reading,
you're a bit more thorough.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.438
Anyone else?

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.441
Come on.

01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:43.575
Come on. Someone? Speak.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.327
Share. Enlighten.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.746
All right, today's class,

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.124
please do your homework.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.835
Half of your grade is participation, okay?

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.263
What was that?
Kyla...

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.474
I don't know what you're
trying to do, but you can't...

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:10.602
Kyla! Get your stuff.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.063
Now!

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.981
Jess, listen, I just...

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.157
Now.

01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.715
He is your teacher.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.216
That's not why you care.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.093
You're jealous.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.845
That is ridiculous.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.389
Look, I've scheduled a meeting

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.433
with your principal for this Wednesday.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.059
Okay, so tell them.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:54.229
I'm 18. So, I'm free to
do what and who I want.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.940
What is the matter with you?

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.358
Are you my daughter?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.068
We're in love.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.321
Those pictures... And Tricia? I mean...

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.658
Was any of that even real?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.493
Did you make all of that up?

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.454
How about you find a new distraction

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.956
that doesn't interfere
with my personal life?

01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:15.875
Go back to cycling, or baking.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.837
I don't care. Just stay out of my way.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.257
I'm still meeting with your principal.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.676
Kyla.
Pick up your phone!

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.453
How could you do this?

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.455
You're ruining your career.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.081
Your life.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.208
My life.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.876
Everything.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.462
You're right.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.841
That's exactly what I did.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.846
I don't know. There's nothing
that I can do or say...

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:14.225
to make it up to you right now.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:18.021
I was so broken when your mom left.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:20.148
I have been so empty.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.362
So lost.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.074
I'm so lost.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.162
I let this happen.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.959
But it's over, okay?

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.547
And no one is worth losing you over.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.883
I should have realized that from the start.

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:48.719
And that's a mistake I'm
gonna have to live with

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.804
for the rest of my life.

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:58.102
I don't expect you to forgive me, okay?

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.772
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.360
I'm so sorry.

01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.882
I didn't expect you to answer.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.551
We need to talk.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.557
Hm. Stalker.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.728
Well, I'm here.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.730
What do you want?
To clear the air.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.690
I didn't steal those photos of you.

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.191
Your phone says otherwise.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:46.943
You planted them.

01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:49.613
I don't know how you did, but you did.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:50.739
You don't have any proof.

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:51.989
I lost scholarships

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.617
because of you, you little bitch.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.702
So, what are you gonna do about it?

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:57.036
Huh?

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.082
Gonna take a swing at me?

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.334
No.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:06.797
Come on. Free shot.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.423
Here, I'll start out for you.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.467
Okay?

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.843
Hey! Stop.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.219
What are you doing?

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.013
Stop.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.141
What's wrong? Are you not having fun yet?

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:20.894
Kyla, stop!

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.854
What the hell!

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.609
Chris is mine.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.862
What the...

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:33.239
What the hell!

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:39.329
Stay right here.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.914
Stay right here. Stay right here.

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.666
Kyla, what the hell!

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.840
Hey, what's going on over here?
Chris!

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.549
Chris, help! She broke my fingers.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.050
What?
Chris!

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.427
She's crazy.
Chris, help me.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.053
She broke my fingers.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.889
What did you do? Huh?
I-I-I didn't do anything.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.933
Riley. Riley, call 911, okay?
Let me see. Let me see.

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:01.768
Hold on, wait, wait. Let me see.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.562
There's been an
assault at Frost High School.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.405
I knew you'd come to my rescue.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.242
Well, the officers
are gonna take you

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.662
to the hospital, okay?

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.288
Okay.
Here you go.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.583
Bye.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:29.253
Kyla, hi!

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.797
I'm sorry, I just got the messages.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.090
I've been in meetings all day.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:34.175
Are you okay?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.260
It's just my hand, Mom.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.762
What do you mean just your hand?

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.015
Well, I'm a little high on pain meds.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.726
Uh, and the doctors said I
might have a concussion,

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.394
so I have to stay here overnight.

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.855
So, you were telling the
truth about Tricia.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.691
Yeah, she's insane.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.902
Okay, well, we still do need
to talk about what happened...

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:55.196
Before you say anything,
I just wanna apologize

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.907
about before.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:08:01.703
I was rude and disrespectful,
and I'm sorry.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:05.456
I think, um, you were right about Chris...

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.668
and everything.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.211
I want you to promise

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.297
that you're not gonna see him anymore.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.970
Maybe, just...
to say goodbye?

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.935
Why don't you rest?
Mom, please.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.978
Fine.
Thank you.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.022
Yeah.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.786
Look, I don't really know what to say

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.578
other than I'm sorry.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.040
Oh, I didn't come here to forgive you.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:49.917
I came here to thank you.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.544
Um, to thank me?

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.379
Yeah, his, uh...

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:56.173
His relationship with you

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.384
helped him see that he needs help.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.386
And he's gonna find some.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.764
I'm gonna help him.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.100
I didn't do anything wrong.
Yes, you did.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.352
You-you used me, you seduced my dad.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.398
And my dad promised me
he'll stay away from you

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.776
for good, so...

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:16.069
It's over.

01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.278
Is that clear?

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.823
Yeah.
Okay, good.

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.283
Look, I know you're upset...

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.660
Okay, don't even begin to pretend

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.868
you know how I'm feeling, okay?

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.496
I'm not, I-I'm just...

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:28.706
I'm trying to apologize.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:33.377
I understand if you never
want to see me again, but...

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.089
I have to ask a tiny favor of you.

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.340
Are you kidding me?

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.591
I-I know the timing is terrible,

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.510
but... I'm supposed to cover

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.095
the girls' volleyball playoffs,

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:46.474
and with my hand, I can't
exactly take pictures.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.477
I know you hate me, but I really
don't wanna let the team down.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.897
They'll be devastated if they
don't get coverage on this.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.025
You can even use my camera.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.611
I'll do it for the team.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.323
Not for you. That's all that I ask.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:05.326
Okay, then.

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.453
Goodbye.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:09.330
Uh, before you go, um...

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.377
Could I maybe speak to
your dad one last time?

01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:16.796
Just to say goodbye.
Okay.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.719
You ready?

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.554
I'm gonna go cover the
volleyball game, okay?

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:27.306
She, uh...

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.642
She wants a word with you first.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.268
To say goodbye.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.355
I can catch a ride with someone else.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.191
It's fine. Don't worry.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.235
I don't have to go in there.
It's up to you.

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:40.444
All right, text me when you get there.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.863
I will.

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.452
My hero. Heh.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.246
How you doing?

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.332
A lot better now.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:55.585
Good.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.963
Listen, Kyla, we...
I did it.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.465
Did what?

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.051
I convinced my Mom and Riley

01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:05.636
that there's nothing going on between us.

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.597
That is great.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:10.558
I'm so glad that you understand.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.103
Now, with Tricia completely
out of the picture,

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:17.107
we can just have our little
secret all to ourselves.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.194
Kyla, we don't have a little secret.

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:23.029
We never did.

01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.989
This, it is over.

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.741
I thought I made that clear to you.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.993
No... Chris, no.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.995
This is just the beginning.

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:32.914
Kyla...
Don't you see?

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.290
What we have is rare.

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:36.459
We need to harness it and nurture it.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.544
Don't just sweep your
feelings under the rug.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.296
I don't have feelings for you.

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:42.132
Don't lie to yourself, baby.

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.217
It's unhealthy.

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:47.011
You need me... and I need you.

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:50.056
This is forever.
Stop, okay?

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:53.226
You're crazy. Fate brought us together.

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:56.729
Now, we just need to be a
little bit more careful.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.815
Kyla, you need help, okay?

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.399
Serious help.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:03.527
Just stay away from me.
Stay away from Riley.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:06.739
We never wanna see you, ever again.

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:09.617
Well, you have to see me again, Chris.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.162
In class, tomorrow,

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.205
and the day after that,
and the day after that.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:15.873
No, no.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.627
If this is how it's gonna
be, I'm gonna quit.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.337
You know what, I'm gonna
clean out my desk tonight.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:22.880
Uh, no, you can't.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.465
If that's what it takes to keep you

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.134
out of our life, then yes.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.970
You can't.
I have to.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.056
And you're clearly not ever gonna stop.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.809
Look at me.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:35.852
This is it, Kyla.

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:38.313
We're done, for good.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.731
Do not walk away from me.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.151
Chris, do not walk away from me!

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.849
Hey, sweetie, it's me.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.560
I'm, uh... I'm here.

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:20.688
I'm actually at the school. Uh...

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.606
Just... Will you meet me in my classroom

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.525
when you're finished?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.903
I'll explain when I see you.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.572
Okay, I love you.

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:32.033
Bye.

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:47.715
Hey, Ky?

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.432
Kyla?

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.935
Uh...

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.232
Kyla?

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.490
<i>Hey, sweetie, it's me.
I'm here.</i>

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.576
<i>I'm actually at the school.</i>

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.245
<i>Will you meet me in my classroom</i>

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.080
<i>when you're finished?</i>

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.171
Hello?

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.638
My God...

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:38.349
Hi, friend.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:42.853
I'm sorry, but there's only
room for one woman in his life.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.197
Oh, God.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.782
And it's gonna be me.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.201
Oh, God...

01:14:58.535 --> 01:15:00.204
Oh, my God.

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.553
A little mood lighting.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.056
Kyla, what the
hell are you doing here?

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.351
What do you think?

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:23.353
I'm here for round two.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.980
I hope you're ready.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.316
What are you talking about?

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.445
Why do you have that?

01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:35.906
It's just a little toy to
make things more exciting.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.450
Hey! Stop!

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.453
Come closer. Oh, God.
What are you doing?

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:43.789
Shh! I'm in charge tonight, okay?

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.749
You can have it next time.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.856
Enough! Stop!
I can't.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.151
You're my everything.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:14.111
I had something close last year,

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:17.532
but he just couldn't cut it.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.326
He didn't give me everything I needed.

01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:21.869
But you do.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.496
I'm not gonna let you go.

01:16:23.538 --> 01:16:26.082
I don't want any part of this.
You know that. Uh!

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.833
Are you saying you don't want me?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:31.462
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Oh, please.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:35.632
That night in your office was
the best night of your life.

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.927
They'll all be like that, Chris,

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.845
from now on.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.098
That was a mistake.

01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:45.226
Don't say things like that to me.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:48.854
Oh!
It hurts my feelings.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.398
If you want it to be better,

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.733
you just have to tell me how you like it.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.570
Ow-ow-ow! Stop!

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.989
I think that's enough foreplay for now.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.284
Are you as excited as I am?

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.411
Kyla, stop it!

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:05.538
Stop. Stop it!
No!

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.706
I'm sick of you not listening to me.

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:18.468
From now on, you're gonna
do things when I say, okay?

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.554
That's how this relationship
is going to work.

01:17:21.596 --> 01:17:23.722
I don't like having to raise my voice,

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.309
so you're gonna have to listen to me.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:27.643
Stop!

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.061
Ah!

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.188
We're gonna start a new family, okay?

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.150
I'll give you a new Riley.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:37.069
What'd you do to Riley?
Baby, calm down.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.621
I'm sorry, I know how
much she meant to you,

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.539
but there just wasn't room for her

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:50.124
in our future plans.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.751
Kyla, just stop it.
Baby, calm down.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.044
Stop!

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.720
That hurt, Chris.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:06.307
That's too rough.
Where's Riley?

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:08.267
That's not how this is going to work.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.609
Oh, no! Chris!

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.201
Who's there?

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.026
Are you all right?

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.236
What happened?

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.320
Please...

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:02.988
I'll get help.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.334
Run!
What?

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:23.300
Sorry, this event is invite-only.

01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:37.231
You're a monster.

01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:40.901
Where's my dad?

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.236
He's having a little rest.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:44.071
We can't have you disturbing him.

01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:53.497
You can't hide from me!

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:41.712
Come on, Riley.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:44.632
We knew we couldn't both share him.

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:47.176
We knew this had to happen eventually.

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:55.892
Just die!

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.779
I'm not sorry.

01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:08.405
I know.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.959
Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.336
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:26.131
Okay? Okay? You're gonna be fine.

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.845
You son of a...

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.978
I'm scared.
It's over now, okay?

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.438
It's all over now.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.482
I'm here. No, I'm here.

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.651
I'll be right in there, hold on. Hold on.

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.396
Are you ready for your first day?

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.522
Oh, hey.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.065
Yeah, just, um...

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.067
putting some finishing
touches on my syllabus.

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:29.779
Hm.
Then I'm headin' out.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.115
Well, um, I'm sure it'll be great.

01:22:33.156 --> 01:22:35.367
Just, please don't brag that much

01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:37.994
about your music history
knowledge this time, okay?

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.247
That is a good teaching tool.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.419
So, um... How about you, hm?

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.212
You ready for your big first day?

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.632
You know what? I think I am.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.967
One good thing about giant
college lecture halls

01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:53.427
is that the professor can't tell

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.262
if you're drawing or paying attention.

01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:58.474
Riley...
I'm kidding.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.350
I'll pay attention, don't worry.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.102
Good.

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.233
The keys?
Oh, the keys.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.611
That's right. Um...

01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:14.448
So, be safe on the freeway.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.866
I will.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.368
I'll see you at dinner, okay?

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.453
You bet.
