00:02.586 --> 00:04.213
I thought Tracy was
getting here at noon.

00:04.379 --> 00:05.964
Movie stars move at
their own pace, Liz.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.382
We have to
accommodate them.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.051
Yeah, well, a lot of people
are still upset

00:09.218 --> 00:10.427
about Tracy
joining the show.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.386
That's not
my problem.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.846
I have other things
on my plate.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.515
You hear about that chemical
factory explosion

00:14.685 --> 00:15.802
outside
of Colorado Springs?

00:15.973 --> 00:16.300
No.

00:16.477 --> 00:17.643
Good.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.352
All right,
here he comes.

00:18.515 --> 00:20.060
I just think when it comes
to this whole Tracy thing,

00:20.225 --> 00:23.603
it's best to
trlightly.

00:25.738 --> 00:26.771
No, no, no.

00:26.945 --> 00:29.610
Stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

00:29.788 --> 00:32.570
It's just us.

00:33.246 --> 00:35.450
Lemon, to tread
lightly is your job.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.660
My job is to keep
Tracy Jordan happy.

00:38.835 --> 00:39.953
Girls, girls, girls.

00:40.126 --> 00:42.082
Let's save it
for Mr. Jordan.

00:42.257 --> 00:44.671
Studio 68 is where
we do The Girlie Show.

00:44.835 --> 00:45.791
Did you all see
Tracy Jordan

00:45.968 --> 00:47.380
make a special appearance
the other night?

00:47.546 --> 00:48.502
Wasn't that exciting?

00:48.676 --> 00:49.800
That is what we
in the show business

00:49.967 --> 00:53.342
like to call a "cameo."

00:54.305 --> 00:57.761
Hey, this is the star
of The Girlie Show, Jenna Maroney.

00:57.937 --> 00:58.893
Hi.

00:59.057 --> 01:01.641
Thank you.

01:04.327 --> 01:06.230
How do you feel,
NBC tour?

01:06.405 --> 01:11.403
'Cause you look good,
like a solid gold candy bar!

01:11.617 --> 01:13.193
Where else do you have
those piercings on your body?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.073
This is it,
everybody.

01:14.245 --> 01:17.073
Here he comes.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.781
Stop, stop, stop.

01:18.958 --> 01:19.663
It's only Jenna.

01:19.835 --> 01:21.333
All right, it's just Jenna.

01:21.497 --> 01:24.750
How you doing, Jenna?

01:31.807 --> 01:32.843
Okay,
I mean granted,

01:33.018 --> 01:37.013
Tracy Jordan has some commercial appeal,
but within his remunenerative body of work

01:37.185 --> 01:38.840
there's just
nothing of value.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.141
What are you
talking about?

01:40.308 --> 01:41.932
Did you ever see
his stand-up?

01:42.108 --> 01:43.850
Give up the butt,
ladies.

01:44.028 --> 01:47.021
Give up the butt.

01:47.355 --> 01:51.570
This is it, I mean it.
Here he comes.

01:59.918 --> 02:00.870
He's an imbecile.

02:01.036 --> 02:04.703
Well, he's our imbecile now.

02:12.795 --> 02:14.131
I'm just surprised he's
still got his shirt--

02:14.306 --> 02:17.380
Oh, there it goes.

02:22.355 --> 02:24.011
Jack!

02:24.185 --> 02:26.141
Oh, my goodness!

02:26.315 --> 02:27.430
It's good to see you
again, brother.

02:27.608 --> 02:29.272
It's good to see
you again.

02:29.447 --> 02:30.441
Oh, that is fantastic.

02:30.607 --> 02:31.941
You have to teach me
that handshake one day.

02:32.118 --> 02:35.111
Listen, Tracy,
if there's anything you need,

02:35.288 --> 02:37.401
anything,
you come to me.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.490
Come on, Jack,
you know I'm the kid.

02:39.668 --> 02:41.700
I'm easy like
Sunday morning.

02:41.877 --> 02:42.623
Don't look at me!

02:42.787 --> 02:44.283
Do not look at me
in the eyes.

02:44.457 --> 02:45.911
Do not look at
Mr. Jordan!

02:46.087 --> 02:49.872
Do not look at him
in the eye.

02:51.636 --> 02:55.172
Just look away.
Look away.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074

03:19.866 --> 03:21.322
Tracy, this is our producer,
Pete.

03:21.497 --> 03:22.113
Hey!

03:22.287 --> 03:23.370
Hey, Pete.

03:23.535 --> 03:24.830
You smoke weed,
right, Pete?

03:24.997 --> 03:27.540
Uh...
No.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.873
Yeah, me neither.

03:29.048 --> 03:31.792
Me and you, Pete.
Me and you.

03:31.965 --> 03:33.293
Pete.
Good to see you.

03:33.466 --> 03:34.671
Is it?
Oh, good.

03:34.845 --> 03:35.791
It's good
to see you too.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.710
'Cause that means
I'm not fired anymore.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.883
I  wasn't gonna
mention that.

03:40.057 --> 03:40.761
But I did.

03:40.927 --> 03:44.052
And now
I'm talking about it.

03:44.227 --> 03:47.603
Relax your balls,
Pete.

03:49.186 --> 03:51.141
Hey, everybody.

03:51.316 --> 03:54.523
Tracy Jordan's here.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.740
Don't just sit there.
Come and give me some sugar.

03:59.905 --> 04:00.823
No, thank you.

04:00.997 --> 04:03.700
Well if you ever want to piss off
your parents, you come see me.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.450
Right this way,
Tracy.

04:05.627 --> 04:07.620
This is Tim Grandy.
He's from Bowie, Maryland.

04:07.786 --> 04:09.331
Rachel Baze,
she just got engaged.

04:09.497 --> 04:11.622
Josh Girard,
he got 760 on his SATs.

04:11.797 --> 04:12.960
Graduated from
SUNY Courtland.

04:13.126 --> 04:15.962
Frank Rossitano has every copy
of Black Tail magazine ever published.

04:16.135 --> 04:17.962
J.D. Lutz,
thyroid problem.

04:18.135 --> 04:19.593
James Spurlock,
but we call him Toofer,

04:19.765 --> 04:20.711
because with him
you get a "Two for One,"

04:20.887 --> 04:22.422
he's a black guy
and a Harvard guy.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.220
And, of course,
you know Lemon.

04:25.397 --> 04:26.602
How did you do that?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.433
It's my job.

04:28.607 --> 04:30.143
Jerry from set design.

04:30.316 --> 04:31.313
Wally,
cue cards.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.940
Rupert Murdoch.

04:33.105 --> 04:34.693
Melinda Gates.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.612
Ziggy from
the cartoon Ziggy.

04:36.775 --> 04:38.441
Anthony Pellano.

04:38.615 --> 04:40.780
Heidi Klum.

04:40.945 --> 04:42.611
The guy that sleeps
with Heidi Klum.

04:42.788 --> 04:45.783
This man's a genius.

04:45.957 --> 04:48.453
Let me just say,
I'm excited to be here.

04:48.627 --> 04:50.200
It's an honor for you
to meet me.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.700
I've got a lot of characters
I'm ready to bust out.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.502
I got a character
named Biscuit.

04:54.675 --> 04:55.673
Write that up.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.210
Got a another character
named Raylondo,

04:57.387 --> 05:00.051
who's a two-foot tall
Spanish hustler.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.172
Glasses, I want you
to write that one.

05:02.347 --> 05:04.091
Got another character
named Ching Chong,

05:04.265 --> 05:06.183
who loves to play
Ping Pong.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.102
I just made that up
right now.

05:08.268 --> 05:09.601
'Cause that's
how I flow.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.971
Now I'm up for anything.

05:11.145 --> 05:14.481
I thought me and you could play
Seinfeld and Bill Cos--

05:14.646 --> 05:17.983
No.
I don't like that.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.241
How you doing?

05:29.416 --> 05:32.701
There is no way I am
working with that guy!

05:32.875 --> 05:34.503
Do  you know that he once got arrested

05:34.668 --> 05:36.212
for walking naked
through LaGuardia?

05:36.376 --> 05:39.333
And that he once fell asleep
on Ted Danson's roof?

05:39.507 --> 05:42.091
Yeah, Tracy has
mental health issues--

05:42.255 --> 05:44.631
He  bit Dakota Fanning
on the face!

05:44.805 --> 05:48.550
When you hear his version,
she was kind of asking for it.

05:48.725 --> 05:52.472
I can't even believe that
you are doing this to me.

05:52.647 --> 05:54.223
Listen, I understand
that this is tough for you.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.982
But what did I tell you?

05:56.147 --> 05:56.981
Not to freak out?

05:57.146 --> 05:58.152
Right.
And what else?

05:58.317 --> 06:00.731
Stop falling in love
with gay guys?

06:00.908 --> 06:02.232
About this.

06:02.407 --> 06:03.481
That you're
looking out for me.

06:03.657 --> 06:04.652
But it doesn't seem--

06:04.828 --> 06:06.242
Jenna, I'm your friend.

06:06.406 --> 06:08.202
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

06:08.363 --> 06:11.911
This show is called The Girlie Show,
and you are the girl.

06:12.087 --> 06:13.953
Nothing is going
to change that.

06:14.129 --> 06:16.412
Okay.

06:31.515 --> 06:32.431
Glaub mir.

06:32.606 --> 06:36.182
Diese "Advantium Microwaves"
sind die beste.

06:36.358 --> 06:39.441
How could you change the name
of my show without telling me?

06:39.606 --> 06:41.482
Detlev, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

06:41.656 --> 06:43.771
Yeah, wunderbar.

06:43.947 --> 06:44.943
Plowchops.

06:45.118 --> 06:48.953
The Girlie Show is now
T.G.S. with Tracy Jordan?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.072
It tested very well
with the focus groups.

06:51.247 --> 06:53.831
If you say you like it,
you can have some pizza.

06:53.995 --> 06:55.122
You people like pizza?

06:55.297 --> 06:57.453
You need to tell Jenna that
this whole thing was your idea

06:57.626 --> 06:58.582
and that I didn't know anything
about it,

06:58.758 --> 07:00.832
and that she should
be mad at you, not me.

07:01.005 --> 07:01.791
Oh, sure.

07:01.966 --> 07:03.842
Then we could sit around
and braid each other's hair

07:04.007 --> 07:05.921
until we get our periods
at the same time.

07:06.095 --> 07:07.462
Look, Lemon,
you're a supervisor.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.722
These people are
not your friends.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.180
Yes, they are my friends.

07:10.345 --> 07:12.223
No, they're your employees.

07:12.395 --> 07:14.721
Well one of my employees
is extremely mad at me.

07:14.898 --> 07:15.642
Will you talk to her?

07:15.818 --> 07:18.681
No, because then you're
not gonna learn anything.

07:18.858 --> 07:20.442
You have to manage
these people, Lemon.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.603
It's your show.

07:21.778 --> 07:22.563
You have the tools.

07:22.737 --> 07:23.812
Now get out there
and build the house,

07:23.997 --> 07:26.283
add on a pool, and throw
yourself into the deep end.

07:26.445 --> 07:27.400
What if I can't swim?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.651
Then I'll do what my father
did when I was two.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.911
Lure you to the edge
of the pool with a puppy,

07:32.075 --> 07:32.871
and push you in.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.620
Yikes.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.790
Fine, I'll figure it out.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.042
We're gonna be shooting
some promos

07:38.206 --> 07:40.963
in an hour underneath
the new sign.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.502
So have your people...
write some stuff.

07:47.677 --> 07:50.301
So I said, "Rick, this chick's
got an Adam's apple."

07:50.477 --> 07:52.132
And Rick said to me,
I'll never forget this.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.643
He said, "Freaky deakies
need love too.

07:56.855 --> 08:00.643
Freaky deakies
need love too."

08:02.148 --> 08:03.231
Charming.

08:03.405 --> 08:06.691
So, how you doing over there,
Theo Huxtable?

08:06.868 --> 08:08.071
I'm doing good.

08:08.236 --> 08:10.153
Unh-unh.
Superman does good.

08:10.327 --> 08:11.741
You're doing well.

08:11.907 --> 08:16.071
You need to study
your grammar, son.

08:17.455 --> 08:21.541
Wow. That was embarrassing
for you.

08:23.335 --> 08:25.330
I don't even have lines
in these promos.

08:25.508 --> 08:27.170
It's all Tracy
he doesn't even mention me.

08:27.345 --> 08:29.173
I'll fix that.
Just stay calm.

08:29.346 --> 08:30.130
Stay calm?

08:30.306 --> 08:31.760
They changed the name
of the show.

08:31.926 --> 08:33.222
You said that you were
looking out for me.

08:33.385 --> 08:36.642
I am.
I will handle it.

08:36.804 --> 08:40.431
Lemon, Lemon.
Can I be real with you?

08:40.605 --> 08:41.982
Yeah.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.983
I haven't had a real job
in like two years.

08:45.155 --> 08:46.441
I'm not used to
all these--

08:46.617 --> 08:47.983
These cue cards
and all of that.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.321
Don't worry about
the cue cards.

08:49.486 --> 08:50.152
Look,  you have two lines.

08:50.328 --> 08:52.280
Just say,
"Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan,

08:52.445 --> 08:54.403
I'm bringing the black
back to NBC."

08:54.576 --> 08:56.162
I'm proud as a peacock,
baby."

08:56.327 --> 08:58.241
You don't even
need these.

08:58.417 --> 09:01.543
You're right.
I got this!

09:01.705 --> 09:03.371
Thanks for looking out
for me, Lemon.

09:03.547 --> 09:04.582
I'm gonna crush it.

09:04.755 --> 09:09.342
Show these people
how a movie star does it.

09:11.848 --> 09:15.632
A little to your right,
Tracy.

09:17.688 --> 09:21.102
Okay, here we go.
In three, two--

09:21.276 --> 09:24.562
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

09:24.737 --> 09:27.483
And I'm proud as a peacork,
baby.

09:27.655 --> 09:29.441
That's great, Tracy,
but it's peacock.

09:29.616 --> 09:30.232
What did I say?

09:30.407 --> 09:31.532
Peacork.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.741
Peacock.
Think peacock.

09:33.907 --> 09:34.783
Right, Jenna?

09:34.955 --> 09:37.162
In three,
two--

09:37.328 --> 09:41.080
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan,
and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.792
And I'm proud as
a pea cock, baby.

09:43.955 --> 09:44.753
Okay.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.330
That time I think you may have
hit it a little bit too hard.

09:47.505 --> 09:52.422
Also, can you throw Jenna's
name in there for me?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.970
In three, two--

09:55.137 --> 09:58.682
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

09:58.847 --> 10:01.011
Right, Jenna Mulvaney?

10:01.186 --> 10:02.562
Maroney.
Rhymes with Baloney.

10:02.728 --> 10:03.433
Here we go.

10:03.608 --> 10:05.233
In three, two--

10:05.398 --> 10:09.060
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

10:09.237 --> 10:12.321
And I'm proud as a peacock.
Right, Mabaloney?

10:12.488 --> 10:13.403
Nope.

10:13.577 --> 10:15.573
In three, two--

10:15.745 --> 10:18.700
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.
I'm black, NBC.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.873
Very proud,
like peacocks.

10:21.036 --> 10:23.992
Right, Janet?
I think we got it.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.253
I think we got it.

10:27.838 --> 10:31.082
Yeah,
I think we did.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.092
Okay, that was
beyond insulting.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.880
The guy doesn't even
know my name.

10:35.055 --> 10:36.423
Why do you
love him so much?

10:36.595 --> 10:39.301
No, no, no, no!
I don't love him.

10:39.478 --> 10:40.930
Donaghy loves him.
That's it.

10:41.095 --> 10:42.761
Pete can't stand him,
Toofer thinks he's an idiot.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.523
Even Cerie
says he's a pig.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.773
Frank likes
his movies.

10:45.935 --> 10:49.481
Frank also loves that video of the monkey
smelling his own butt.

10:49.656 --> 10:50.102
Mmm.

10:50.278 --> 10:53.443
Nobody wants Tracy Jordan here
except for certified

10:53.616 --> 10:57.030
non-genius Jack Donaghy.

10:57.197 --> 10:58.453
Sorry to interrupt,
Ms. Maroney,

10:58.616 --> 11:00.950
but the sound guys
want their microphone back.

11:01.117 --> 11:02.621
So everyone can...?

11:02.785 --> 11:04.333
Hear everything you are saying.
Yes, ma'am.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.161
Oh my God. I didn't use
the N word, did I?

11:06.336 --> 11:08.293
Oh, no, no, no,
Miss Maroney, you did not.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.543
Oh, good.
I mean, I never would, but, you know--

11:10.716 --> 11:11.582
Jenna,
take the mic off!

11:11.758 --> 11:13.502
Sorry.

11:13.677 --> 11:17.551
Oh, my God.
That was bad, right?

11:17.717 --> 11:20.471
It wasn't great.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.140
Jack Donaghy
wants to see you.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.892
No, no, no.
Tell him I'm very busy.

11:24.057 --> 11:26.850
Come in,
she's very busy.

11:27.027 --> 11:29.350
Mr.  Donaghy,
I sincerely apologize.

11:29.528 --> 11:30.692
I'm so embarrassed.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.771
I guess you must
be embarrassed

11:31.946 --> 11:34.063
if you're hiding
in the storage closet.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.152
This is my office.

11:36.327 --> 11:36.982
Really?

11:37.156 --> 11:38.362
I see you bring
a little feminine magic

11:38.535 --> 11:40.070
to everything you touch.

11:40.246 --> 11:42.413
How did it go with Tracy Jordan
when you apologized?

11:42.576 --> 11:44.163
I didn't think I needed
to talk to him.

11:44.325 --> 11:46.661
I mean, he's not my friend,
he's my employee.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.202
No, he's not your employee,
he's your product.

11:49.378 --> 11:51.580
Like it or not, you're in
the Tracy Jordan business now.

11:51.756 --> 11:53.792
And when you screw the pooch
the way you did today,

11:53.967 --> 11:56.713
it's your responsibility to get
in there and make things right.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.013
How do I do that?

11:59.177 --> 12:01.720
I don't know.
I'm a non-genius.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.221
I'm really sorry!

12:04.395 --> 12:06.221
Lunch break,
that's a lunch break.

12:06.395 --> 12:07.973
Back in 30 minutes.

12:08.156 --> 12:11.980
Tracy, I hope I didn't
hurt your feelings before.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.232
Please.

12:13.408 --> 12:14.690
You can't hurt me.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.651
I did stand-up
on the road.

12:16.827 --> 12:19.321
A crowd once threw
a motorcycle at me.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.451
Good, 'cause, you know, I'm just
trying to calm Jenna down.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.450
'Cause she's kinda
paranoid and neurotic,

12:23.617 --> 12:26.781
and your being is just
bringing out all of her crazy.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.793
Please don't think
that everyone hates you.

12:28.955 --> 12:30.663
Pete thinks that
everybody's an idiot.

12:30.838 --> 12:33.290
Especially Frank,
who is an idiot.

12:33.466 --> 12:34.960
Josh is just jealous
'cause you're gonna get

12:35.135 --> 12:36.252
more screen time
than him.

12:36.428 --> 12:38.422
And Toofer's just afraid
of black people.

12:38.597 --> 12:39.462
Which one is Toofer?

12:39.638 --> 12:40.420
The black guy.

12:40.597 --> 12:41.171
Oh.

12:41.346 --> 12:43.592
My point is,
don't worry about them.

12:43.768 --> 12:46.893
You are the only person
that the network cares about.

12:47.057 --> 12:47.643
Ms. Lemon?

12:47.807 --> 12:50.681
I just wanted to let you know
y'all are on the monitors right now.

12:50.858 --> 12:51.601
Everyone can--

12:51.778 --> 12:54.690
Hear you and see you.
Yes, ma'am.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.810
Son of a mother!

12:58.158 --> 12:59.270
Paranoid?

12:59.448 --> 13:01.991
Well, that just confirms
all my suspicions.

13:02.156 --> 13:05.160
Sorry, everybody.

13:22.888 --> 13:25.680
Hey, buddies.

13:26.185 --> 13:28.220
All right,
I deserve that.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.563
But I didn't say anything
about you guys

13:29.727 --> 13:32.433
that I wouldn't have said
to your faces.

13:32.606 --> 13:35.523
Fine. The important thing is
don't take this out on Tracy--

13:35.696 --> 13:37.442
That dude sucks!

13:37.608 --> 13:38.902
Okay, are we going to talk
about this like adults,

13:39.066 --> 13:43.030
or are you just gonna
throw things at me?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.703
All right.
Okay, fine.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.663
Get it out of your system.

13:46.828 --> 13:48.570
Nothing that plugs in,
you guys!

13:48.748 --> 13:52.793
Nothing that could
really hurt me!

14:00.257 --> 14:01.591
Hello.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.130
Lemon.

14:07.098 --> 14:09.013
How are things
in the deep end?

14:09.186 --> 14:11.432
Fine.

14:11.607 --> 14:13.390
The staff is meshing
together well?

14:13.565 --> 14:15.773
Oh, yes, yeah.

14:15.935 --> 14:18.233
Good.

14:18.487 --> 14:21.693
I'm counting on you.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.663
We got to do something.

14:34.836 --> 14:37.002
Let's crash my car
to see if the air-bags go off.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.541
Let me explain what
I'm talking about first.

14:39.716 --> 14:42.713
Everybody is mad.
At us.

14:42.888 --> 14:44.050
Mostly mad at you.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.303
Yeah, well, that's
because Donaghy threw me

14:45.466 --> 14:47.131
into the deep end of a pool
that I didn't even want

14:47.306 --> 14:49.090
to build in the first place!

14:49.266 --> 14:51.222
Look, I'm just saying,
we both screwed up today.

14:51.396 --> 14:54.142
I think we should make nice
and buy everybody some pizza

14:54.316 --> 14:55.143
and some soft drinks--

14:55.318 --> 14:56.270
Nah, nah, nah.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.273
This is what we're
gonna do, Lemon.

14:58.446 --> 15:00.060
You're going to get
everybody on my yacht.

15:00.238 --> 15:01.942
Harbor cruise.
Drinks.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.113
Togetherness.

15:03.275 --> 15:05.071
That's great.
You have a yacht?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.241
I got a yacht.
I got a solid gold jet-ski.

15:07.405 --> 15:08.781
Two Batmobiles.

15:08.956 --> 15:12.492
The AIDS monkey's bones...

15:17.968 --> 15:21.920
Welcome!
Welcome to your fantasy!

15:22.175 --> 15:26.591
We're both hosting.
The ice cream bar was my idea.

15:26.766 --> 15:28.300
This is surprisingly
tasteful.

15:28.476 --> 15:30.973
Oh, yeah.
I've taken this boat many places.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.720
Miami, Tokyo, Denver.

15:33.898 --> 15:35.810
What does that mean,
Avanti Domani?

15:35.977 --> 15:36.471
What?

15:36.645 --> 15:37.433
The name
of the boat.

15:37.606 --> 15:40.232
Oh, that's Spanish for
"remember your mother."

15:40.397 --> 15:41.603
No, I don't think it is.

15:41.775 --> 15:45.022
Hello, boys.
I brought champagne.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.111
I'm so glad you came.

15:46.285 --> 15:46.983
Get away from me.

15:47.157 --> 15:49.783
My Baloney!
Look at you. Wow.

15:49.956 --> 15:50.743
Yeah, thanks.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.993
Let me make you a drink.
You love apple martinis, right?

15:55.166 --> 15:57.202
Yes, how did
you know that?

15:57.378 --> 16:00.040
I read your interview
in Amtrak Magazine.

16:00.216 --> 16:01.712
Really?
You saw that?

16:01.875 --> 16:02.580
Mm-hmm.

16:02.755 --> 16:03.543
Wow.

16:03.716 --> 16:06.752
Did you know that all the writers
in that magazine are also conductors?

16:06.925 --> 16:07.593
I didn't know that.

16:07.758 --> 16:11.182
Hey, Toofer,
see if I got any schnapps.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.553
Good gravy.
This is a Dunwoody '62.

16:13.726 --> 16:16.013
It's for you.
Take it, my friend.

16:16.186 --> 16:18.772
Thank you.

16:27.447 --> 16:30.782
That is just wasteful.

16:31.906 --> 16:32.572
I hear you sing.

16:32.748 --> 16:33.862
I didn't know that.

16:34.038 --> 16:35.370
Why don't you sing
something for me?

16:35.538 --> 16:38.580
Oh, no.
Nobody wants to hear that.

16:38.745 --> 16:39.042
I  do.

16:39.207 --> 16:45.082
Some folks like to get away,
take a holiday from the neighborhood

16:45.715 --> 16:50.461
Hop a flight to Miami Beach
or to Hollywood...

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
Let's get out of here.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.262
Is that a real song?

17:03.566 --> 17:04.390
It's going well, right?

17:04.567 --> 17:06.190
It has to,
it has to go well.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.652
Relax, everybody's
having a great time.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.780
How's Jenna?

17:09.948 --> 17:10.819
Furious and drunk.

17:10.984 --> 17:12.401
But at least she's
getting along with Tracy.

17:12.578 --> 17:14.612
Well, he does know
how to throw a party.

17:14.786 --> 17:16.161
Think we're ever
gonna leave the dock?

17:16.326 --> 17:16.662
I don't know.

17:16.826 --> 17:20.413
The engines haveeen running
for like three hours.

17:20.585 --> 17:22.540
Hey, hey! Grizz!

17:22.705 --> 17:25.210
Grizz, don't wreck
this boat!

17:25.377 --> 17:26.920
Grizz is driving
the boat?

17:27.087 --> 17:31.000
Don't worry.
He was in the Navy.

17:39.477 --> 17:39.931
I got one,
I got one.

17:40.107 --> 17:43.232
Jerry Seinfeld
and Bill Cosby!

17:43.397 --> 17:45.481
What's the deal
with pudding?

17:45.645 --> 17:47.523
I'm Bill Cosby.
Jell-o! Sweaters!

17:47.695 --> 17:50.360
Whoo! Yeah!

17:51.986 --> 17:53.150
That doesn't even sound
like the Cos.

17:53.328 --> 17:54.243
I'm gotta go lay down.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.070
Got you on
that one, man.

17:56.245 --> 18:00.703
He got you again, man.
Get better references.

18:00.876 --> 18:02.872
Tracy, thank you so much
for doing this.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.371
You totally saved me.

18:04.546 --> 18:05.540
You don't have to
thank me, Lemon.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.503
We're a team now.

18:06.675 --> 18:07.541
Like Batman and Robin.

18:07.717 --> 18:10.423
Like chicken and
a chicken container.

18:10.595 --> 18:11.670
Hey, where's
your bathroom?

18:11.846 --> 18:14.592
Second door
on the right.

18:14.765 --> 18:18.680
All right,
let's do another one.

18:26.027 --> 18:28.811
That's weird.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.741
Por favor,
no me dueles.

18:38.917 --> 18:39.953
Me llamo María.

18:40.126 --> 18:40.450
What?

18:40.626 --> 18:43.541
Please calling
Ted and Nancy Peabody.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.411
You tell Who Dat Ninja
is on the boat.

18:46.586 --> 18:47.461
What are you saying?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.633
Tracy Jordan
is on the boat.

18:49.797 --> 18:51.383
He no see me.
I hidden from him.

18:51.545 --> 18:54.460
I hide from him.

18:54.638 --> 18:55.672
Oh, my God.

18:55.847 --> 18:57.932
It's Spanish for,
"Remember Your Mother."

18:58.098 --> 18:59.640
I've taken this boat
to Denver.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.221
You can have that scotch.
Grizz was in the Navy!

19:03.396 --> 19:04.810
It's not his boat!

19:04.978 --> 19:08.443
Sir, you need to
disembark immediately.

19:08.608 --> 19:10.900
This is not his boat!
We gotta get off this thing!

19:11.065 --> 19:12.362
This is not his boat!

19:12.528 --> 19:15.402
Disembark immediately.

19:15.577 --> 19:17.533
Is this your boat?

19:17.696 --> 19:21.031
Disembark immediately.

19:24.416 --> 19:28.041
Run! Jump!
Get out of here!

19:42.346 --> 19:44.142
Good morning.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.392
Morning.

19:46.565 --> 19:48.310
Okay,
you were right.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.603
I'm sorry?

19:49.778 --> 19:51.562
I can't do this.
I can't manage these people.

19:51.737 --> 19:53.152
It was a disaster.

19:53.316 --> 19:56.440
What are you talking about?
Everybody loved your little Lemon party.

19:56.615 --> 19:58.822
I think it brings the team together
like a harrowing experience.

19:58.996 --> 19:59.902
You pulled it off.

20:00.076 --> 20:00.532
Really?

20:00.706 --> 20:01.661
They bonded.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.321
Good job.

20:03.498 --> 20:04.663
Okay.

20:04.838 --> 20:08.950
I guess now I just have to read about
how Tracy Jordan tried to steal a boat.

20:09.128 --> 20:09.790
No, I took care
of that.

20:09.965 --> 20:12.330
The Peabodys will be getting
some free rides on the NBC jet.

20:12.506 --> 20:13.830
There won't be anything
in the papers at all.

20:14.007 --> 20:17.422
Really?
What about this?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.590
Well, I had to give them
something.

20:19.767 --> 20:20.091
Ugh.

20:20.268 --> 20:23.260
Don't worry.
She's gonna love it.

20:23.438 --> 20:25.351
That's just insulting.

20:25.518 --> 20:27.932
Liz, Liz, did you see me
in the Post?

20:28.105 --> 20:30.351
Oh, my God,
it's so embarrassing.

20:30.525 --> 20:32.773
Look how thin I look.
And look how many emails I've gotten.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.612
It's not even
8:00 AM in L.A.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.980
Should I call Stern?

20:37.158 --> 20:40.070
You're welcome.
