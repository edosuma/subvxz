WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.633
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.633 --> 00:03.703
THEY'RE RUNNING DRUGS
THROUGH THE BAR, JACK.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.306
(man) WE FOUND NARCOTICS
AND A HANDGUN

00:05.306 --> 00:06.707
HIDDEN IN THE BILGE.
 DECLAN PORTER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.080
NO. WAIT! WAIT! STOP.
IT'S MINE!

00:09.080 --> 00:11.212
MARCO AND I ARE IN TALKS

00:11.212 --> 00:13.384
TO FIND HIM A POSITION
WITHIN THE COMPANY.

00:13.384 --> 00:14.715
AFTER WHAT HE DID?

00:14.715 --> 00:17.248
IT'S JUST SMART BUSINESS.
RIGHT, NOLAN?

00:17.248 --> 00:19.450
SO IT'S OFFICIAL.
HE'S THE NEW C.E.O.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.252
MY SON IS VERY MUCH
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:21.252 --> 00:23.154
PERSUADE HIM TO DROP
HIS INTEREST IN GRAYSON GLOBAL,

00:23.154 --> 00:26.527
AND I WILL STAND BEHIND YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.499
YOUR EX-FIANCEE
JUST BROKE UP WITH ME.

00:28.499 --> 00:30.231
(Nolan) A FAKE UP?

00:30.231 --> 00:31.502
I'D SAY DANIEL'S ALREADY
THINKING... (singsongy) MAKE UP.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.404
THAT'S THE IDEA.

00:33.404 --> 00:36.207
YOU REALIZE I'M THREE MOVES AWAY
FROM SNAPPING YOUR NECK?

00:36.207 --> 00:39.110
IF YOU DO THAT, HOW WILL YOU
EVER REUNITE WITH YOUR SISTER?

00:39.110 --> 00:41.372
(Emily) IF I HAVE TO PLAY NICE
WITH DANIEL FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

00:41.372 --> 00:45.216
THEN IT'S A SMALL PRICE
TO PAY.

00:48.319 --> 00:50.181
(Emily) THEY SAY
 THE BEST-LAID PLANS

00:50.181 --> 00:53.084
OFTEN GO AWRY.

00:53.084 --> 00:57.528
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW DETAILED
 THE PREPARATION...

00:57.528 --> 01:01.192
A PLAN WILL ALWAYS HAVE
 A WEAK POINT.

01:01.192 --> 01:06.237
AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
 LOOKING TO EXPLOIT IT...

01:06.237 --> 01:08.599
TO DOOM A PLAN TO FAILURE,

01:08.599 --> 01:12.203
AND THE PERPETRATOR
 ALONG WITH IT.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.082
(seagulls calling)

01:23.454 --> 01:25.386
HEY.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.660
WHERE YOU BEEN?

01:29.660 --> 01:31.722
THINKING.

01:31.722 --> 01:35.126
ABOUT THE KISS.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.200
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.202
BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.103
I'M SURE IT DID
TO DANIEL.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.106
YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED ME
TO TRUST YOU.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.708
WELL, YOU NEED
TO TRUST ME, TOO.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.240
YOU CAN'T JUST DISAPPEAR

01:49.240 --> 01:50.881
WHEN THINGS GET
A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:52.543 --> 01:55.146
LIKE IT OR NOT, DANIEL IS
THE BEST REMAINING LINK

01:55.146 --> 01:56.647
TO THE PEOPLE WHO DESTROYED
OUR FAMILIES.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.149
I DIDN'T
COME HERE LAST NIGHT

01:58.149 --> 02:00.491
TO KEEP TABS
ON YOU AND DANIEL.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.194
I CAME TO TELL YOU

02:03.194 --> 02:05.256
THAT HELEN CROWLEY
MADE CONTACT WITH ME.

02:05.256 --> 02:06.857
OR MORE ACCURATELY,

02:06.857 --> 02:08.758
SHE ALLOWED ME
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HER.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.261
THE INITIATIVE KNOWS
WHO YOU ARE?

02:10.261 --> 02:11.702
NOT ENTIRELY.

02:11.702 --> 02:13.734
TAKEDA'S SECURITY MEASURES
SEEM TO HAVE HELD UP.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.267
THEY DON'T APPEAR TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU

02:16.267 --> 02:17.438
OR OUR DEEPER CONNECTION.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.139
WHAT DID SHE WANT
FROM YOU?

02:19.139 --> 02:22.243
MY COMPLICITY.

02:22.243 --> 02:27.418
SHE... TOLD ME THAT
COLLEEN WAS STILL ALIVE.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.380
DID SHE OFFER YOU PROOF?

02:29.380 --> 02:30.881
NO.

02:30.881 --> 02:32.583
THEN THERE'S NO REASON
TO BELIEVE THEM.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.425
THEY WILL SAY ANYTHING
TO MANIPULATE YOU.

02:34.425 --> 02:36.427
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT... LOOK,

02:36.427 --> 02:37.928
IF--IF SHE THINKS
I'M UNDER THEIR THUMB, THEN--

02:37.928 --> 02:39.730
THEN WE'VE GOT A DIRECT LINE
TO THE INITIATIVE,

02:39.730 --> 02:42.463
WHICH DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU
FALLING BACK IN WITH DANIEL.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.267
(sighs)
CAN YOU STILL CONTACT HER?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.199
NO.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.800
SAID SHE'S GONNA
CONTACT ME.

02:52.303 --> 02:55.276
(exhales) THEN WE NEED
TO DRAW HER OUT.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.679
(telephone rings in distance)

02:58.679 --> 03:02.313
(intercom beeps)
 (Grace) Your 9:00 AM--
Emily Thorne--is here.

03:02.313 --> 03:04.555
THANK YOU, GRACE.
SEND HER IN.

03:04.555 --> 03:06.217
(siren wailing in distance)

03:06.217 --> 03:08.489
(telephone ringing in distance)

03:08.489 --> 03:10.521
GOOD MORNING.
 MORNING.

03:10.521 --> 03:11.692
OH.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.863
(clears throat)

03:12.863 --> 03:14.925
I'M SORRY.
WAS THAT NOT...

03:14.925 --> 03:16.297
NO, IT'S, UH--

03:16.297 --> 03:17.868
I JUST THOUGHT
AFTER LAST NIGHT, WE--

03:17.868 --> 03:20.271
WE DID KISS, RIGHT?
I-I DIDN'T DREAM THAT?

03:20.271 --> 03:22.603
(laughs) YES,
AND IT WAS--IT WAS GREAT.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.605
I JUST, UM...

03:24.605 --> 03:26.807
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WHATEVER'S HAPPENING HERE,

03:26.807 --> 03:29.280
THAT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE TAKING IT SLOWLY.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.981
YEAH.

03:30.981 --> 03:34.315
YEAH,
PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.817
I ACTUALLY CAME HERE
TO TALK TO YOU

03:36.817 --> 03:39.550
ABOUT A CHILDREN'S CHARITY
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

03:39.550 --> 03:41.252
SINCE 2008.

03:41.252 --> 03:42.723
OKAY. TELL ME ABOUT IT.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.326
BASICALLY, THE ORGANIZATION
ASSISTS KIDS IN DANGER

03:45.326 --> 03:47.698
OF SLIPPING THROUGH
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

03:47.698 --> 03:49.560
IF YOU MEANT WHAT YOU SAID

03:49.560 --> 03:51.862
ABOUT REHABILITATING
GRAYSON GLOBAL'S IMAGE,

03:51.862 --> 03:53.704
I'D LIKE TO INVITE
YOUR TOP-TIER INVESTORS

03:53.704 --> 03:55.005
TO OUR ANNUAL WINE AUCTION.

03:55.005 --> 03:56.907
(knock on door)

03:56.907 --> 03:58.569
EXCUSE ME.
THIS CAME FOR YOU.

03:58.569 --> 04:02.413
HAND DELIVERED WITH
A NOTE MARKED "URGENT."

04:03.944 --> 04:06.246
STONEHAVEN UNITED SOLUTIONS.
WHO SENT THIS?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.919
HELEN CROWLEY.
SHE'S HOLDING ON LINE TWO.

04:08.919 --> 04:10.621
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

04:10.621 --> 04:12.022
UM, GRACE,
CAN YOU GIVE MS. THORNE

04:12.022 --> 04:13.554
MY CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT LIST?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.286
SURE.
 OKAY. THANK YOU.

04:15.286 --> 04:16.957
CAN I CALL YOU LATER?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.959
YES. PLEASE DO.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.395
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THAT LIST.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.737
(door closes)
 UM, GRACE, DO YOU MIND
IF I USE YOUR PHONE?

04:26.737 --> 04:27.898
MINE'S OUT OF BATTERY.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.039
SURE. JUST DIAL 9
TO GET OUT.

04:29.039 --> 04:30.571
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.843
HELEN.

04:32.843 --> 04:33.944
Hello, Daniel.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.778
Do you have the Stonehaven
prospectus in front of you?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.780
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.582
The question is, why?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.714
Consider it a gift.

04:43.714 --> 04:44.885
This time next quarter,

04:44.885 --> 04:46.517
that company is poised
to triple its revenues,

04:46.517 --> 04:48.018
only they don't know it yet.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.360
OH, BUT YOU DO?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.422
Why else would I recommend
you acquire it?

04:51.422 --> 04:52.763
Have the same killer instinct
you showed

04:52.763 --> 04:53.994
in assimilating Nolcorp

04:53.994 --> 04:56.026
before someone else
beats you to it.

04:56.026 --> 04:58.028
Speaking of,
have you followed up

04:58.028 --> 04:59.870
on our previous discussion?

04:59.870 --> 05:02.373
I DID.
YOUR HUNCH WAS RIGHT.

05:02.373 --> 05:05.406
THERE ARE SOME GAPS
IN NOLCORP'S EARLY R&D.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.977
MS. THORNE,
HERE'S OUR CLIENT LIST.

05:06.977 --> 05:09.410
YES,
I WILL BE BY THIS AFTERNOON

05:09.410 --> 05:11.011
TO CHECK
THE FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.313
OKAY. THANKS.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.085
HERE YOU GO.
HOPE IT'S HELPFUL.

05:15.085 --> 05:17.518
THANK YOU.

05:23.053 --> 05:26.056
(dialing)

05:28.098 --> 05:30.731
VICTORIA.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.834
I THINK I HAVE
SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.507
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE COPS
ARE THE ONES

05:36.507 --> 05:38.008
WHO TIPPED OFF
NATE AND KENNY?

05:38.008 --> 05:40.010
It's the only explanation.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.612
(buzzer in distance)
 They knew the police
were coming,

05:41.612 --> 05:44.815
so they moved all the drugs
onto the boat to set me up.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.116
AND I PLAYED
RIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS.

05:46.116 --> 05:47.778
I'm calling Emily
for bail money.

05:47.778 --> 05:49.680
I don't want her
involved in this.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.951
Fine. Nolan, then.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.453
YOU'RE NOT SPENDING
ANOTHER NIGHT HERE.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.954
I don't want to drag
any of our friends

05:53.954 --> 05:55.085
into this mess, okay?

05:55.085 --> 05:57.488
JACK, THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE STUBBORN.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.929
Whoever gets us
the bail money

05:58.929 --> 06:00.831
WILL GET IT BACK.

06:00.831 --> 06:02.062
(taps)

06:02.062 --> 06:03.564
No prosecutor's
gonna believe for one second

06:03.564 --> 06:04.765
those drugs belong to you.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.037
And if they trace
the registration to the gun,

06:07.037 --> 06:08.769
THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT--
 That it was used to kill
Kenny and Nate's father

06:08.769 --> 06:09.970
six years ago.

06:12.543 --> 06:14.575
And it belonged to my dad.

06:16.006 --> 06:16.977
So, um...

06:16.977 --> 06:19.049
THIS WHOLE SETUP IS WHAT,

06:19.049 --> 06:21.412
payback for what happened
to their father?

06:23.954 --> 06:25.956
(man shouts indistinctly
in distance)

06:25.956 --> 06:28.158
You can't do

06:28.158 --> 06:29.690
ANYTHING AGAINST
THE RYANS.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.391
THEY WILL HURT YOU

06:31.391 --> 06:32.893
or Declan...

06:32.893 --> 06:34.525
or Carl.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.797
AMANDA, PROMISE ME.

06:39.029 --> 06:41.532
ENJOY, CONRAD. THEY'RE
IMPORTED STRAIGHT FROM CUBA.

06:41.532 --> 06:43.033
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,

06:43.033 --> 06:44.835
BUT COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.
(chuckles)

06:44.835 --> 06:46.006
YES.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.738
JASON?

06:47.738 --> 06:48.909
OH, WHAT A DELIGHT.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.711
VICTORIA,
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.042
WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT TO THE HAMPTONS?

06:52.042 --> 06:53.484
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP.

06:53.484 --> 06:55.716
IT APPEARS MY 20-YEAR RIVALRY
WITH YOUR HUSBAND

06:55.716 --> 06:56.987
HAS COME TO AN END.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.989
UH, JASON BROUGHT
BY A BOX OF CUBANS

06:58.989 --> 07:00.921
TO COMMEMORATE
MY RETIREMENT.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.953
IS THAT WHAT THEY CALL
CORPORATE EXILE THESE DAYS?

07:02.953 --> 07:04.555
OH, TRUST ME.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.597
I'M ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE DONE
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

07:06.597 --> 07:08.599
AND WHAT DOES
THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROMISE,

07:08.599 --> 07:09.930
A RUN FOR OFFICE?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
PERHAPS.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.803
(scoffs)
 JUST WHEN I THOUGHT

07:12.803 --> 07:14.835
I HAD THE BIGGEST EGO
IN THE TRISTATE AREA.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.006
I'M SORRY.

07:16.006 --> 07:17.468
CONRAD, MAY I HAVE
A WORD ALONE WITH YOU?

07:17.468 --> 07:18.639
GLADLY.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.612
JASON, PLEASE EXCUSE US.

07:24.074 --> 07:28.018
I KNOW. I KNOW.
THE MAN IS AN OGRE.

07:28.018 --> 07:30.481
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR OPENING MY OWN DOOR.

07:30.481 --> 07:31.652
I COULD CARE LESS

07:31.652 --> 07:33.954
ABOUT YOUR PETTY RIVALRY
WITH JASON PROSSER.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.627
I AM CONCERNED
WITH HELEN CROWLEY.

07:36.627 --> 07:39.590
APPARENTLY, SHE DIRECTED
OUR SON TO ACQUIRE A COMPANY

07:39.590 --> 07:41.131
CALLED
STONEHAVEN UNITED SOLUTIONS.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.833
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING
TO YOU?

07:42.833 --> 07:45.936
STONEHAVEN IS A DISASTER
RECOVERY FIRM, IF MEMORY SERVES.

07:45.936 --> 07:49.139
THIS, DEAR,
IS WHAT THE INITIATIVE DOES.

07:49.139 --> 07:52.773
THEY INFLUENCE UPHEAVAL AND THEN
PROFIT IN THE AFTERMATH.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.575
AFTERMATH OF WHAT,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.507
ANOTHER FLIGHT 197?

07:56.507 --> 07:58.809
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN UPON
THIS LITTLE MORSEL?

07:58.809 --> 08:01.211
WHILE YOU'RE BUSY DEBATING
YOUR BID FOR POLITICAL OFFICE,

08:01.211 --> 08:03.614
I HAVE BEEN SECURING ALLIANCES

08:03.614 --> 08:04.955
CLOSE TO DANIEL

08:04.955 --> 08:07.017
THAT WILL HELP ENSURE
THE FUTURE OF THIS FAMILY.

08:07.017 --> 08:08.158
AND IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING

08:08.158 --> 08:10.020
TO THWART THESE DEVILS,
I WILL.

08:10.020 --> 08:13.023
AND HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO DO THAT?

08:18.098 --> 08:20.571
SABOTAGE.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.905
Captioning provided by
ABC Studios, ABC, Inc.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.908
and brought to you by Ford.
Go Further.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.188
THANK YOU FOR
THE STONEHAVEN TIP, EMILY.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.851
OF COURSE.
IS IT SIGNIFICANT?

08:40.851 --> 08:43.253
IT'S HARD TO SAY JUST YET.

08:43.253 --> 08:44.755
BUT TO THAT END,

08:44.755 --> 08:46.196
I'M NOT SURE
HOW INCLUDING DANIEL

08:46.196 --> 08:48.198
IN YOUR UPCOMING CHARITY AUCTION
WOULD CONVINCE HIM

08:48.198 --> 08:50.200
TO ABANDON HIS POST
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.202
I KNOW. I'M AFRAID
THAT WAS IN THE WORKS

08:52.202 --> 08:54.064
BEFORE WE HAD
OUR CONVERSATION,

08:54.064 --> 08:56.166
AND IT'S HARD TO TURN
A SHIP ON A DIME.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.268
AH, WELL, C'EST LA GUERRE.

08:58.268 --> 08:59.910
(both chuckle)

08:59.910 --> 09:01.572
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH WITH IT,

09:01.572 --> 09:05.545
MIGHT I SUGGEST THAT YOU INVITE
JASON PROSSER TO THE EVENT?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.078
JASON PROSSER
OF PROSSER WEALTH FUNDS?

09:08.078 --> 09:09.279
OH, YOU KNOW OF HIM?

09:09.279 --> 09:11.251
OF COURSE, BUT ISN'T HE
ONE OF GRAYSON GLOBAL'S

09:11.251 --> 09:12.783
BIGGEST COMPETITORS?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.554
YES.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.086
MEN LIKE CONRAD AND JASON

09:16.086 --> 09:18.959
JUDGE THEIR MANHOOD
BY THE SIZE OF THEIR WALLETS.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.260
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MY EXPERIENCE

09:20.260 --> 09:23.093
THAT THE MOST LUCRATIVE
CHARITY AUCTIONS

09:23.093 --> 09:24.294
ARE THE ONES THAT PIT

09:24.294 --> 09:26.166
TWO CORPORATE EGOS
AGAINST EACH OTHER. (laughs)

09:26.166 --> 09:27.267
MM.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.338
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

09:28.338 --> 09:31.241
I'M SURE I COULD GET JASON
TO ATTEND.

09:31.241 --> 09:34.304
(chuckles)
PERMISSION GRANTED.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.677
(seagulls calling)
 DECLAN. AMANDA.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.178
I'M GUESSING BY THE FACES,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.080
OUR BOY JACK'S
STILL IN THE PENALTY BOX.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.281
THANKS TO YOU SETTING HIM UP.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.784
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU GUYS WANT?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.786
CAN WE JUST GET IT OUT?
 HEY, SETTLE DOWN, KID.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.618
YOU WANT OUT? THAT'S SIMPLE.

09:47.618 --> 09:49.660
YOU JUST SELL US
THE REST OF THE BAR.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.222
IN FACT, UH, THAT SHOULD
COVER IT RIGHT THERE.

09:52.222 --> 09:53.964
HEY, THIS IS OUR HOME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

09:53.964 --> 09:55.866
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
 DECLAN, EASY.

09:55.866 --> 09:57.768
YOU PROBABLY NEED
YOUR BIG BRO'S SIGNATURE

09:57.768 --> 09:59.700
TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL ANYWAY,
SO I TELL YOU WHAT--

09:59.700 --> 10:01.601
WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK TO US
IN ABOUT, MM,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.334
10 TO 15 YEARS
WHEN HE GETS OUT, OKAY?

10:08.338 --> 10:10.240
HE'S JUST
SHOOTING HIS MOUTH OFF.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.281
HE DOES THAT.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.213
WHEN HE'S NOT PLANTING DRUGS
OR GUNS

10:13.213 --> 10:15.015
ON OUR BOAT, YOU MEAN?

10:15.015 --> 10:18.018
DON'T PLAY INNOCENT
WITH ME.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.855
TAKE MY ADVICE, OKAY?
GO ALONG TO GET ALONG.

10:24.855 --> 10:26.927
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE TROUBLE
FOR YOU GUYS.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.299
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN
DO WITH YOUR ADVICE, KENNY.

10:29.299 --> 10:30.961
(huffs)

10:37.768 --> 10:39.710
I READ THROUGH THE TECH REPORT
YOU PROVIDED

10:39.710 --> 10:42.012
OF EVERYTHING
NOLCORP HAS IN DEVELOPMENT.

10:42.012 --> 10:43.373
(telephone ringing in distance)

10:43.373 --> 10:44.945
IMPRESSIVE, RIGHT?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.277
INCOMPLETE, ACTUALLY.

10:47.277 --> 10:49.249
THERE WERE
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ALLOCATED

10:49.249 --> 10:52.052
BETWEEN 2004 AND 2006
TO A PROJECT

10:52.052 --> 10:54.054
THAT'S VANISHED
FROM THE BOOKS.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.726
SOMETHING CALLED CARRION.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.331
LOOK, DANIEL, NOT ALL OUR R&D
YIELDS VIABLE PRODUCTS.

11:01.331 --> 11:04.064
WELL, WHATEVER IT DID YIELD
COULD BE SOLD OFF

11:04.064 --> 11:06.066
TO RECOUP OUR LOSSES.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.199
UNLESS YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING FROM ME.

11:09.199 --> 11:12.372
(scoffs) I'M NOT
HIDING ANYTHING FROM YOU.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.904
OH.

11:13.904 --> 11:16.006
BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY RULE

11:16.006 --> 11:19.209
TO KEEP FAILED DEVELOPMENT
IN HOUSE.

11:19.209 --> 11:21.351
WELL, EVERYTHING WE DO
INCORPORATES BITS AND PIECES--

11:21.351 --> 11:24.014
WELL, THERE ARE
NEW RULES NOW, NOLAN,

11:24.014 --> 11:25.685
FULL DISCLOSURE
BEING ONE OF THEM.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.017
NOW I WANT A REPORT

11:27.017 --> 11:28.759
DETAILING ALL OF
YOUR ABANDONED DEVELOPMENT,

11:28.759 --> 11:30.390
AND I WANT IT
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.826
(buttons snap)

11:37.427 --> 11:39.870
(Padma)
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.473
MY GUESS?

11:43.473 --> 11:46.406
EXTREME DADDY ISSUES.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.979
HAD ENOUGH TIME AWAY?

11:52.182 --> 11:53.343
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

11:53.343 --> 11:55.946
AND... I WAS NEVER QUALIFIED

11:55.946 --> 11:58.448
TO BE YOUR C.F.O.
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

11:58.448 --> 12:01.221
SO I DON'T CARE ABOUT
LOSING MY POSITION.

12:02.492 --> 12:05.225
BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.358
AND IF YOU'LL HAVE ME,

12:08.358 --> 12:10.500
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK
TO WORK.

12:13.363 --> 12:15.065
PADMA...

12:17.107 --> 12:18.869
YOU'RE SMART.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.972
THERE ARE SO MANY
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE.

12:21.972 --> 12:23.974
UNLESS THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

12:23.974 --> 12:26.777
HAVE AN OFFICE DOWN THE HALL
WITH YOU IN IT,

12:26.777 --> 12:29.749
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.352
OKAY. YOU'RE HIRED.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.284
AGAIN.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.456
HIRED TO WHAT CAPACITY
EXACTLY?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
(clears throat)

12:38.358 --> 12:41.992
YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT
GET ALL TERRITORIAL.

12:41.992 --> 12:44.865
I'M SURE WE CAN FIND ROOM
FOR OUR FORMER C.F.O.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.398
WE FOUND ROOM FOR YOU,
DIDN'T WE?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.541
OF COURSE.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.403
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

12:55.305 --> 12:58.278
WELCOME. WELCOME BACK.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.780
HE'S NOT HAPPY.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.053
NEITHER AM I.

13:03.053 --> 13:04.955
I DON'T HAVE A DATE FOR

13:04.955 --> 13:09.820
EMILY'S CHARITY WINE AUCTION
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.822
ANY IDEAS?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.575
CONRAD.

13:25.575 --> 13:28.108
MS. DAVENPORT.
WELL, I KNEW YOU HAD MOXIE,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.380
BUT SHOWING YOUR FACE
BACK HERE SO SOON,

13:30.380 --> 13:32.943
IF I WEREN'T SO INTRIGUED,
I'D BE SHOCKED.

13:32.943 --> 13:34.985
I'M HERE TO PROTECT
AN INVESTMENT.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.147
AND WHAT INVESTMENT
WOULD THAT BE?

13:37.147 --> 13:39.890
MY TIME WHILST
IN YOUR FAMILY'S EMPLOY.

13:39.890 --> 13:43.223
I BELIEVE I MAY STILL BE OWED
A FEW DIVIDENDS.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.555
BLACKMAIL.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.858
(laughs) OF COURSE.

13:47.858 --> 13:50.030
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT ISN'T BENEATH YOU?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.362
I DON'T WANT HUSH MONEY.
 OH?

13:52.362 --> 13:54.364
THE TRUTH IS,
IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR ME

13:54.364 --> 13:56.066
TO START OVER IN A PLACE

13:56.066 --> 13:59.139
WHERE MY ABILITY TO HOLD
ANY NUMBER OF SECRETS

13:59.139 --> 14:01.141
MIGHT NOT BE AS VALUED
AS IT IS IN THE GRAYSON FOLD.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.442
OH, WELL, IN CASE
YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

14:02.442 --> 14:05.375
MY TRAITOROUS SON NOW SITS
ATOP MY FORMER THRONE,

14:05.375 --> 14:07.978
IN NO SMALL PART
TO YOUR ASSISTANCE.

14:07.978 --> 14:10.280
SO AS IT STANDS,

14:10.280 --> 14:11.451
I'M HARDLY IN A POSITION

14:11.451 --> 14:13.483
TO REHIRE YOU
IN YOUR FORMER CAPACITY.

14:13.483 --> 14:17.587
WE CAN LOOK AT THIS
EITHER OF TWO WAYS.

14:17.587 --> 14:19.289
I KNOW WHERE THE BODIES
ARE BURIED,

14:19.289 --> 14:21.231
PROVERBIAL AND OTHERWISE.

14:21.231 --> 14:24.134
I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO ALL MANNER
OF CHICANERY,

14:24.134 --> 14:27.867
FROM FICTIONAL KIDNAPPINGS
TO INFLATED INVESTOR RETURNS.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.641
AND THE OTHER WAY,
MS. DAVENPORT?

14:31.641 --> 14:35.405
QUITE SIMPLY,
I AM GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

14:35.405 --> 14:37.377
AND WHILST
YOUR FAMILY BREATHES,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.549
THERE WILL BE A DEMAND
FOR MY TALENTS.

14:39.549 --> 14:43.353
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE ASKING
TO REENTER VICTORIA'S ORBIT.

14:43.353 --> 14:46.286
WELL, AS PER MY TERMS,

14:46.286 --> 14:48.358
ALL OF WHICH
ARE NONNEGOTIABLE,

14:48.358 --> 14:51.361
THE DRAGON LADY
IS YOURS TO WRANGLE.

14:52.963 --> 14:55.625
WELL, SERENDIPITY PREVAILS...

14:55.625 --> 14:56.997
MS. DAVENPORT.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.029
YOU SEE,
THESE TALENTS YOU SPEAK OF

14:59.029 --> 15:00.330
MAKE YOU
PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED

15:00.330 --> 15:02.632
TO ASSIST
IN MY NEXT ENDEAVOR.

15:02.632 --> 15:05.175
SO WE HAVE A DEAL?

15:05.175 --> 15:07.277
YOU MIGHT CALL IT THAT.

15:07.277 --> 15:09.179
(Daniel) WELL DONE.

15:09.179 --> 15:10.340
THE NET WORTH
ON THIS GUEST LIST

15:10.340 --> 15:12.342
EXCEEDS THE G.D.P.
OF MOST SMALL COUNTRIES.

15:12.342 --> 15:15.345
(laughs) WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

15:15.345 --> 15:18.448
THAT MAKES THE TWO OF US.

15:18.448 --> 15:20.991
THERE IS, HOWEVER,
ONE CLIENT OF YOURS

15:20.991 --> 15:22.993
THAT I'M HAVING TROUBLE
NAILING DOWN--

15:22.993 --> 15:25.996
UM... HELEN CROWLEY.

15:25.996 --> 15:27.998
AIDEN MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT MEETING HER

15:27.998 --> 15:30.160
AT ONE OF YOUR INVESTOR
LUNCHEONS THIS SUMMER.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.062
YOU INVITED AIDEN?

15:32.062 --> 15:34.104
NO. I INVITED AIDEN'S BOSS.

15:34.104 --> 15:36.266
AIDEN R.S.V.P.'d.

15:36.266 --> 15:37.567
BUT IF HE'S WILLING
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAUSE,

15:37.567 --> 15:39.369
I CAN'T SAY NO.

15:39.369 --> 15:41.641
(cell phone rings)

15:41.641 --> 15:43.943
(rings and beeps)

15:43.943 --> 15:45.445
DANIEL GRAYSON.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.217
MS. CROWLEY,

15:47.217 --> 15:48.618
HELLO.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.320
EVENING, DANIEL.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.123
I, UH, I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

15:53.123 --> 15:54.424
No, not at all.

15:54.424 --> 15:57.027
Just dinner with
 my colleague Emily Thorne.

15:57.027 --> 15:59.589
SHE'S A CONSULTANT FOR
OUR PHILANTHROPIC CONCERNS.

15:59.589 --> 16:04.064
UH, IN FACT, SHE'D LOVE
A WORD WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.535
(beep)

16:05.535 --> 16:07.537
HELEN, YOU'RE ON
WITH EMILY.

16:07.537 --> 16:09.269
So nice to meet you.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.341
AND YOU, TOO,
MS. CROWLEY.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.573
LISTEN, I KNOW HOW VALUABLE
YOUR TIME IS, SO...

16:13.573 --> 16:15.405
I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.977
I'M HOSTING A CHARITY
WINE AUCTION TOMORROW NIGHT.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.250
Well, I imagine
Daniel's told you

16:20.250 --> 16:22.482
that I'm
a-a very private person.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
I don't make a habit
of going to parties.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.417
OH, WELL, I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.419
YOU SEE, OUR CHARITY
SUPPORTS FOSTER KIDS

16:29.419 --> 16:30.760
WHO HAVE AGED OUT
OF THE SYSTEM.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.093
THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO,
NO GUIDANCE.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.226
IT CAN BE A REALLY SCARY TIME
FOR THEM.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.471
AND... WELL, THE MORE
DEEP POCKETS IN ATTENDANCE,

16:41.471 --> 16:45.335
THE BETTER IT REFLECTS
ON DANIEL AS THE NEW C.E.O.

16:45.335 --> 16:47.377
I like the way you think.

16:47.377 --> 16:52.082
Perhaps I can put in
an appearance.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.583
TERRIFIC. (laughs)

16:53.583 --> 16:56.646
I'LL PUT YOU
ON THE V.I.P. LIST.

16:56.646 --> 16:58.548
If all your consultants
are this tenacious, Daniel,

16:58.548 --> 17:00.550
I predict good things
for your future.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.393
Go back to your meeting.
I'll call later.
 (line disconnects)

17:03.393 --> 17:07.357
VERY IMPRESSIVE, MS. THORNE.

17:12.162 --> 17:13.203
I HAD A CURIOUS CONVERSATION

17:13.203 --> 17:15.034
WITH DANIEL GRAYSON
RECENTLY.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.607
HE WAS INQUIRING...

17:17.607 --> 17:20.140
ABOUT OUR
EARLY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.071
THAT SEEMS LIKE
A STANDARD INQUIRY.

17:22.071 --> 17:24.214
HE JUST WANTS TO ASSURE
FISCAL TRANSPARENCY.

17:24.214 --> 17:27.117
OH, I THINK IT WAS
MORE CALCULATED THAN THAT.

17:27.117 --> 17:30.680
HE WAS INQUIRING
ABOUT CARRION.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.222
THERE'S NO WAY

17:32.222 --> 17:35.725
HE COULD'VE HAPPENED UPON
THAT INFORMATION, SO...

17:35.725 --> 17:38.228
SOMEBODY
MUST HAVE TIPPED HIM OFF.

17:38.228 --> 17:39.629
AND YOU THINK IT WAS ME?

17:39.629 --> 17:42.232
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT
DUSTED CARRION OFF

17:42.232 --> 17:43.363
AND PUT HER ON MY DESK.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.395
I DID THAT TO REMIND YOU

17:45.395 --> 17:47.167
OF THE GREATNESS
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.
 OH.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.238
NOLAN, I'M TRYING TO--

17:48.238 --> 17:49.399
TO REBUILD THE TRUST
YOU ONCE HAD IN ME,

17:49.399 --> 17:51.671
NOT DESTROY IT.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.743
LOOK, I WANNA...

17:53.743 --> 17:56.646
BELIEVE YOU, MARCO.

17:56.646 --> 17:57.847
I DO.

17:57.847 --> 18:00.110
BUT, UH, YOU CAN SEE WHY
THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.182
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I SEE.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.353
MM?

18:03.353 --> 18:04.854
RIGHT BEFORE DANIEL
COMES SNOOPING AROUND,

18:04.854 --> 18:07.187
A CERTAIN GIRL CONVENIENTLY
SHOWS BACK UP INTO YOUR LIFE?

18:07.187 --> 18:10.120
YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO REMEMBER
YOU COMING BACK INTO MY LIFE

18:10.120 --> 18:12.091
IN EXACTLY THE SAME FASHION.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.665
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING
THAT I LOST MY WHOLE COMPANY

18:15.665 --> 18:17.167
TO GRAYSON GLOBAL
THE DAY YOU DID.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.600
AND YOU KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT THAT.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.272
LOOK,

18:22.272 --> 18:25.435
AT SOME POINT, WE ARE GONNA
HAVE TO PUT THIS BEHIND US.

18:27.577 --> 18:30.440
OKAY.

18:32.742 --> 18:36.686
(telephone ringing in distance,
woman speaking indistinctly)

18:36.686 --> 18:39.719
(jazz playing)

18:39.719 --> 18:42.452
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

18:42.452 --> 18:44.554

18:48.658 --> 18:49.829
MM.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.201
DID I TELL YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK

18:51.201 --> 18:52.162
IN THAT DRESS?

18:52.162 --> 18:54.264
(laughs)
TWICE, ACTUALLY.

18:54.264 --> 18:55.465
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

18:55.465 --> 18:57.267
SOME THINGS
ARE WORTH REPEATING.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.568
(man) MASTER GRAYSON.

18:58.568 --> 19:00.240
JASON PROSSER,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.141
NICE TO SEE YOU, DANIEL.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.274
AND CONGRATS
ON THE NOLCORP COUP.

19:04.274 --> 19:05.915
AGGRESSIVE PLAY.

19:05.915 --> 19:08.618
YOUR OLD MAN NEVER COULD'VE
PUT THAT DEAL TO BED SO QUICKLY.

19:08.618 --> 19:09.779
DON'T BE SO SURE.

19:09.779 --> 19:11.251
WHATEVER ACUMEN I HAVE
FOR THE JOB

19:11.251 --> 19:12.422
I OWE TO MY FATHER.

19:12.422 --> 19:13.753
HE WAS MY MENTOR.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.625
AND NOW HE'S NOT EVEN
AN EMPLOYEE.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.927
WHO IS THIS LOVELY LADY?

19:17.927 --> 19:19.789
EMILY THORNE.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.791
UH, I'M SO HAPPY YOU COULD
MAKE IT, MR. PROSSER.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.793
I'M SORRY. I-I THOUGHT
YOU TWO KNEW EACH OTHER.

19:23.793 --> 19:25.895
ACTUALLY, YOUR MOTHER
INVITED ME THIS EVENING.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.268

19:43.253 --> 19:45.285
COME.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.658
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

19:48.658 --> 19:50.890
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN MY DAD
AND PROSSER IS LEGENDARY.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.392
SHE PROBABLY INVITED HIM HERE

19:52.392 --> 19:53.893
TO EMBARRASS ME
ON THE AUCTION BLOCK.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.797

HOW'S YOUR OTHER BOYFRIEND
HANDLING IT?

20:06.376 --> 20:08.878

20:33.633 --> 20:36.506
I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT'S KEEPING MY DATE.

20:36.506 --> 20:38.308
(liquid pours)

20:38.308 --> 20:41.911
SO... YOU THINK HELEN'S
GONNA MAKE AN APPEARANCE?

20:41.911 --> 20:43.613
NO QUESTION.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.445
I'M CONVINCED SHE HAS
DANIEL'S OFFICE WIRED.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.447
SHE'LL COME
BECAUSE SHE'S CURIOUS.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.018
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT?

20:49.018 --> 20:49.979
YOU.

20:49.979 --> 20:51.681
I LED HER TO BELIEVE THAT

20:51.681 --> 20:53.683
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED
THAT SHE COME TONIGHT.

20:53.683 --> 20:55.825
RIGHT.

20:55.825 --> 20:58.928
AIDEN, ARE YOU READY
FOR THIS?

20:58.928 --> 21:01.260
YOU SEEM DISTRACTED.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.962
ANYTHING BUT.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.434
ON WITH THE SHOW.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.039
(clank)
 They want the bar, Jack.

21:10.039 --> 21:13.303
And Nate offered $1.

21:13.303 --> 21:14.644
(buzzer in distance)
 Not for a million dollars

21:14.644 --> 21:15.975
are they getting the bar
from us.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.577
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID, BUT...

21:17.577 --> 21:19.278
you know,
what I can't figure out

21:19.278 --> 21:20.950
is why they want it so bad
in the first place.

21:25.355 --> 21:28.658
It's time you knew
the truth.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.660
AND DECLAN WON'T ANSWER
MY PHONE CALLS.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.992
IT'S AS IF
 I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.494
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.526
(clicks tongue)
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

21:36.526 --> 21:38.368
DECLAN'S JUST TRYING
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.031
(seagull crying)

21:42.031 --> 21:43.733
THEY'RE THE ONES
BEHIND EVERYTHING

GO TO YOUR PARENTS.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.885
MY PARENTS? WHY?

21:55.885 --> 21:57.947
IF THE RYAN BROTHERS
WANT MONEY,

21:57.947 --> 21:58.918
I'VE GOT PLENTY
OF MY OWN.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.019
IT ISN'T ABOUT MONEY.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.822
IT'S ABOUT POWER
AND INFLUENCE.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.795
YOUR MOTHER'S ON RECORD SAYING
SHE'D DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

22:05.795 --> 22:08.898
MY MOTHER ISN'T EXACTLY KNOWN
FOR LIVING UP TO HER WORD.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.802

37:43.962 --> 37:46.595
OH, WOULD THAT BE
YOUR WORK...

37:46.595 --> 37:48.337
OR DANIEL'S?

37:48.337 --> 37:49.668
OKAY. THIS AGAIN.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.969
UM...

37:50.969 --> 37:53.001
NOLAN, WHAT--WHAT DO I
HAVE TO SAY TO YOU?

37:53.001 --> 37:54.042
WHAT--WHAT CAN I DO?

37:54.042 --> 37:55.574
YOU CAN STOP
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.006
EVERY MOVE THAT YOU'VE MADE
SINCE YOU'VE COME BACK

37:58.006 --> 38:01.410
HAS BEEN
ABOUT UNDERMINING ME.

38:01.410 --> 38:04.913
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN TELLING HIM?

38:04.913 --> 38:06.615
THE TRUTH,

38:06.615 --> 38:09.688
A CONCEPT THAT...
CONTINUES TO ELUDE YOU.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.320
CHECK MY E-MAILS.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.491
CHECK MY E-MAILS.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.493
CHECK EVERY LAST COMMUNICATION
I HAVE MADE

38:14.493 --> 38:15.824
SINCE I STARTED
WORKING HERE AGAIN.

38:15.824 --> 38:17.526
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

38:17.526 --> 38:19.968
AND SINCE YOU WOULD'VE NEVER
RUN IT THROUGH

38:19.968 --> 38:21.500
STANDARD E-MAIL...
 (typing)

38:21.500 --> 38:22.931
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

38:22.931 --> 38:24.973
(computer beeps)
 A GHOST.

38:24.973 --> 38:26.405
NOT UNLIKE THIS ONE,

38:26.405 --> 38:29.678
SENT TO
DANIEL'S PERSONAL E-MAIL.

38:29.678 --> 38:31.540
"SUBJECT--MISSING R&D.

38:31.540 --> 38:34.343
"N.R. WILL DENY
IT EVER EXISTED.

38:34.343 --> 38:36.445
DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER."

38:39.688 --> 38:41.420
IT'S THE GHOSTS THAT GET YOU.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.422
NOLAN, LOOK, I SWEAR TO YOU,
I DID NOT--

38:43.422 --> 38:44.923
I DID NOT WRITE THAT.

38:44.923 --> 38:47.055
LOOK...

38:47.055 --> 38:49.428
GET OUT.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.059
FOREVER.

38:52.961 --> 38:54.963
UM...

38:54.963 --> 38:57.506
YOU'RE MAKING
A VERY BIG MISTAKE.

39:12.781 --> 39:14.082
HOW'D WE DO?

39:14.082 --> 39:15.884
(Aiden) Brilliant.
It was Oscar-worthy.

39:15.884 --> 39:17.586
HELEN'S ON THE HOOK?

39:17.586 --> 39:18.987
WELL, I'M STILL ALIVE,
AREN'T I?

39:18.987 --> 39:21.860
LOOK, WE SHOULD, UM...
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.533
OH, AIDEN, I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT...

39:24.533 --> 39:26.665
I'M EXPECTING COMPANY.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.667
EMILY, IF--IF OUR PLAN
TONIGHT WORKED,

39:28.667 --> 39:30.639
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KEEP UP
THIS CHARADE WITH DANIEL.

39:30.639 --> 39:31.940
WELL, IF IT WORKS.

39:31.940 --> 39:35.504
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE,
WE STAY THE COURSE.

39:35.504 --> 39:38.407
AND DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CONTROL THE SITUATION

39:38.407 --> 39:40.048
with Daniel.

39:40.048 --> 39:42.951
FAIR ENOUGH.

39:42.951 --> 39:45.754
EVERY PLAN HAS A FATAL FLAW.

39:45.754 --> 39:47.085
(Daniel) EMILY?

39:47.085 --> 39:50.388
SOMETIMES IT'S THE HEART...

39:50.388 --> 39:52.891
HOW ABOUT
A $1-MILLION NIGHTCAP?

39:52.891 --> 39:54.493
(laughs)

39:54.493 --> 39:56.995
EVEN IN THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED
 TO BE THE MOST CAREFUL.

40:02.170 --> 40:06.435
BUT A CAREFUL NATURE
 DOESN'T ALWAYS ENSURE SUCCESS.

40:08.777 --> 40:13.882
WHEN A PLAN IS BUILT
 ON AN UNSTABLE FOUNDATION...

40:13.882 --> 40:17.886
FAILURE IS NOT ONLY
 A POSSIBILITY,

40:17.886 --> 40:19.588
IT'S A CERTAINTY.

40:19.588 --> 40:20.989
(snips)

40:20.989 --> 40:22.651
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
OPENING THIS WITH ME.

40:22.651 --> 40:25.423
AH, LIVE FOR THE MOMENT,
RIGHT?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.926
BESIDES, YOU'RE WORTH IT.

40:29.057 --> 40:30.799
WHAT SHALL WE TOAST TO?

40:30.799 --> 40:32.030
(inhales deeply)

40:32.030 --> 40:35.033
TAKING IT SLOW
AND DRINKING IT QUICKLY.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.064
(chuckles)

40:36.064 --> 40:37.435
(clink)

40:39.808 --> 40:41.039
MM.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.941
UGH.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.112
OH, IT'S GONE BAD.

40:44.112 --> 40:46.014
(mouth full)
OH, MY GOODNESS.

40:46.014 --> 40:48.477
I'M SO SORRY. (laughs)

40:48.477 --> 40:50.949
(laughs)

40:50.949 --> 40:52.981
OH, WHAT THE HELL?
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

40:52.981 --> 40:54.923
(laughs)

40:54.923 --> 40:56.054
(knock on door)

40:58.587 --> 41:00.058
AIDEN.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.890
(chuckles)

41:03.592 --> 41:05.463
EXCUSE ME.

41:07.035 --> 41:09.598
(sighs) I THINK I CAN GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

41:09.598 --> 41:11.069
YEAH, I SAW THE LIGHTS
WERE ON.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.242
UH, I THOUGHT
I'D FETCH MY THINGS.

41:14.242 --> 41:15.744
DANIEL.

41:15.744 --> 41:17.506
AIDEN.

41:17.506 --> 41:19.508
I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

41:19.508 --> 41:21.009
NO, NOT REALLY.

41:21.009 --> 41:23.812
UM, IT'S FINE.

41:23.812 --> 41:24.913
HERE.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.588
HERE.

41:29.588 --> 41:32.190
I'LL, UH, JUST TAKE IT THAT
THAT'S EVERYTHING, THEN.

41:32.190 --> 41:35.524
IT IS. TRUST ME.

41:35.524 --> 41:37.966
OKAY.

41:37.966 --> 41:39.497
NIGHT.

41:44.072 --> 41:46.705
(sighs) SORRY.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.638
NO, I SHOULD--I SHOULD
GET GOING, TOO.

41:49.638 --> 41:51.910
THANK YOU FOR THE WINE,
REALLY.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.582
THAT WAS A LOVELY GESTURE.

41:53.582 --> 41:56.014
YEAH. MAYBE WE SHOULD QUIT
WHILE WE'RE BEHIND...

41:56.014 --> 41:57.145
FOR NOW.

41:57.145 --> 41:58.587
MM.

42:08.056 --> 42:10.729
(phone rings)

42:10.729 --> 42:12.030
(rings, line clicks)

42:12.030 --> 42:13.201
(Helen) Yes.

42:13.201 --> 42:14.633
IT'S ME.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.735
I HAVE AN UPDATE.

42:16.735 --> 42:18.637
I HAVE CONFIRMATION NOLAN ROSS

42:18.637 --> 42:21.610
IS HIDING THE CARRION PROGRAM
SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE COMPANY.

42:21.610 --> 42:23.642
GOOD.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.614
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.

42:25.614 --> 42:27.616
(beep)
