00:00.001 --> 00:03.535
<i>- Previously on
"Emerald City..."</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:10.009
What is this place?
- Prison of the
Abject.

00:10.011 --> 00:13.445
For anyone who violates
the
Wizard's law against
magic.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.516
- Help me.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.752
- What happened to you?
- I don't remember.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.754
Squeeze the trigger.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.222
<i>- The Witch of the</i>
<i>East</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:24.590
<i>By whose hand, we don't
know.</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:28.761
- There is only
one man to blame.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.095
<i>- Where does the road
lead?</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:31.330
<i>- To the Wizard of Oz.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:33.032
And he can probably
take me home.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.401
- Find out who or what
fell from the sky.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.636
<i>Make sure it doesn't</i>
<i>come back to Emerald</i>
<i>City.</i>

00:43.644 --> 00:47.613
<i>- So I say "who's</i>
<i>there,"</i>
<i>even though I know it's</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:47.615 --> 00:49.281
<i>- Right.
- Why?</i>

00:49.283 --> 00:50.349
<i>- Let's just try it
again.</i>

00:50.351 --> 00:52.084
Knock, knock.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.122
Knock, knock.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.357
- Why are you knocking?

01:03.064 --> 01:04.263
What about...

01:04.265 --> 01:05.364
baseball?

01:05.364 --> 01:06.464
Have you ever heard of
baseball?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.667
I might have.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.702
Who's to say?

01:16.477 --> 01:19.211
- Do you remember
anything from here?

01:19.213 --> 01:23.515
Anything you recognize
or makes you feel
something?

01:25.152 --> 01:28.287
- Yeah.
- What?

01:28.289 --> 01:31.156
- You.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.125
- How long have you
been saving that?

01:33.127 --> 01:35.260
- A few miles.

02:15.202 --> 02:18.804
- I think I'll meet
Glinda at
the foot of the Eternal
Warrior.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.739
Show of strength.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.742
- But meeting her
halfway...

02:23.744 --> 02:25.744
shouldn't you make her
come to you?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.513
- If I didn't know
better,
I'd think you were

02:27.515 --> 02:28.881
on my side, Isabel.

02:28.883 --> 02:32.484
- Glinda may have chosen
me,
but I serve you.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.755
- Your pregnancy
says otherwise.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.792
- Glinda of the North
has arrived.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.833
- Witches.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.635
- You may have
outlawed their magic,

02:49.637 --> 02:51.537
but your people
still love them.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.539
- 'Cause they don't know
them.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.861
- The Bowler said he
he'd never
seen a wound like it
before.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.566
A hole...
carved neatly

03:20.568 --> 03:22.367
out of our sister's
head.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.603
She was to see me
when it happened.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.472
Matters of great
import.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.941
Any idea what?

03:28.943 --> 03:32.611
- You look <i> terrible.</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:35.948
- It's been 20 years.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.217
Time ravages.
How would you have me
look?

03:38.219 --> 03:41.520
- Like you didn't just
crawl out of a poppy
field.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.856
- Where I crawl
is none of your
problem.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.259
- It is, actually.

03:47.261 --> 03:50.262
The Wizard has granted
my request

03:50.264 --> 03:53.365
to open our sacred
temple.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.602
But it won't make any
difference

03:56.604 --> 03:58.670
if your tongue's
not right.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.772
- My tongue is
perfect.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.909
- We are the last
Cardinal
Witches, you and I.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.379
If you cannot sing
your sister properly

04:07.381 --> 04:09.248
and right her to rest,

04:09.250 --> 04:12.618
then she will be the
last.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.020
And we'll be nothing.

04:16.991 --> 04:21.260
- I will sing her
properly
and right.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.830
I'll get us what we
need.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.766
Then we can put another
20 years between us.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.318
- What's Eamonn looking
for?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.387
The girl went round
the mountain,

04:48.389 --> 04:49.721
and he's staring
through it.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.390
Has he gone mad?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.825
- Why don't you go
and ask him?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.061
- Think I won't?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.965
I'm not spending
another night out here.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.974
Would you mind telling
us
what we're still doing
here?

05:08.976 --> 05:11.476
Ojo said the girl
went round the pass.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.944
- Ojo was lying.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.624
Eamonn.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.759
Eamonn!

05:27.761 --> 05:30.362
- We shouldn't be here.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.898
- What is this place?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.666
- Cesspool of witches.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.005
And look at him.
Wizard's right-hand
man.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.374
Gonna get us all
killed
hunting for some girl

05:42.376 --> 05:44.676
who fell from the sky.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.581
So I'll tell you
what...

05:49.583 --> 05:52.451
We break south,
find the girl
ourselves,

05:52.453 --> 05:54.653
ride back to Emerald
City
with her head,

05:54.655 --> 05:56.488
then we'll have
the Wizard's loyalty.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.791
- No, Eamonn's not
gonna
let us break off.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.727
- Yeah, you're right.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.495
Guess we'll have to
kill him.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.133
We'll cut him into
bits.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.069
Make it look like lions
did it.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.079
- Do you want me
to slow down?

06:21.081 --> 06:24.850
- Ha. You must really
want to get home.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.152
- Yeah, I have people
waiting for me.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.855
- What kind of people?

06:29.857 --> 06:33.125
- People.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.559
- Ah.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.695
- Someone you laid with.
- What?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.663
Laid with?
- You know, someone
who...

06:38.665 --> 06:42.033
- Uh, I know what you
mean.
- So?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.436
- I'm not having this
conversation with you,
Lucas.

06:44.438 --> 06:48.540
- Why not?
- Because I don't know
you.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.076
- Well, you saved me,
so how does that work?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.878
- No.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.547
I'm a nurse.
That's what I do.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.816
- What?
- A healer.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.187
Lucas?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.622
- Lucas!
- Lucas.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.662
- Put pressure, okay?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.030
We're gonna get you
help.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.611
- You're just a little
septic,
but I've already

07:25.612 --> 07:27.079
stopped the bleeding,
so you're fine.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.547
All you need is a shot
of
penicillin... it's the
most

07:28.549 --> 07:29.881
common drug in the
world.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.217
- My world.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.989
Hi, sir, my friend is
dying,
and I need some
medicine.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.224
Do you know where
I can find any?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.759
Medicine, uh...

07:40.761 --> 07:42.594
doctor, pharmacy.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.663
For him.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.998
- Apothecary?
- Yes!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.133
Yes, an apothecary.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.668
Where can I find one?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.470
- She don't take to
visitors.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.505
- Look, sir,
I'm begging
you... please.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.475
I just need to know
where she
is, otherwise he's
gonna die.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.204
What are you up to,
boy?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.772
- Ma'am?

08:27.774 --> 08:28.940
- There's a chill.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.175
- I'm all right.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.110
- It's time for
your medicine.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.519
- I think no more
of that, love.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.020
You need rest.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.894
I'm off to get
a chicken for dinner.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.829
- You're leaving?

08:50.831 --> 08:54.065
- I'll be back soon,
Tip.
Don't you worry.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.719
- Jack?
- I've been waitin'
forever!

09:47.721 --> 09:49.020
How much time do we
have?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.288
- She went to the
butcher's.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.357
- What?
- She went to the
butcher's!

09:52.359 --> 09:54.726
- Well, how long is
that?
- I don't know, not
long.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.763
I can't take it
anymore, Jack.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.899
You've got to find a
way in.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.133
Today's the day.

10:12.012 --> 10:17.182
- May I present
Maiden of Northern
Light,

10:17.184 --> 10:20.318
Mother of the Sound and
Pure,

10:20.320 --> 10:23.655
and the Mistress of
the Western Fields,

10:23.657 --> 10:24.923
Vessel, solace...

10:24.925 --> 10:27.092
- Yeah, yeah,
Vessel, solace,
truth...

10:27.094 --> 10:30.161
I spend half my life
waiting to
walk in and out of
rooms.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.366
- Glinda.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.800
It's been some time.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.204
- The North is always
open to you.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.072
Isabel?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.710
This is Anna.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.747
She'll be true and
chaste,

10:48.749 --> 10:51.850
without distraction
of body and mind.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.885
To better serve you.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.060
- Nope, nope.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.062
You stay.
Stay.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.332
Well, don't look at
her.
You belong to me now.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.101
Come.
Come, listen and learn.

11:19.046 --> 11:23.181
My condolences regarding
your Eastern sister.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.018
- We appreciate you
unsealing our temple

11:27.020 --> 11:29.921
so we can
honor her properly.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.724
- I know that wasn't
possible
with Mother South.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.926
The Beast Forever
was merciless with
her.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.764
So...

11:42.335 --> 11:47.338
I have a...
request of my own.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.942
Mistress East and I,
we had a partnership.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.711
- The Prison of the
Abject.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.112
- Yes, an unfortunate
name.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.414
- An unfortunate
prison.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.316
- It wasn't my
creation.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.052
- We can't unlock it,
if that's what you
want.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.723
- So whatever magic
she used to open it,

12:04.725 --> 12:07.225
I give you my
permission
to re-create it.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.393
- I wish we could,

12:08.395 --> 12:11.229
but a witch's spells
are her own.

12:11.231 --> 12:15.934
And there are
a thousand variations.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.103
Normally, East would've
had an apprentice

12:18.105 --> 12:21.806
to pass along
the fruit of her
tongue, but...

12:21.808 --> 12:24.275
you put an end
to all that, didn't
you?

12:27.447 --> 12:31.349
If there's nothing
else,
we have preparations to
make.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.857
- You feeling all
right,
Mistress?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.326
- Hmm?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.094
Perfect.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.301
Jack!

12:50.303 --> 12:53.938
- There's no way through!
- No, there has to be!

12:55.776 --> 12:57.776
Look, it's too hard.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.912
- Mate, you can't give
up.
- I won't.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.013
Not until I'm through.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.352
And then we're gonna...
- Get the heck out of
here.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.488
Yeah.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.257
Get the heck out of
here.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.495
- Jack, someone's
coming
up the hill.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.130
- What?
- Someone's coming up
the hill.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.398
- Hurry!
- Who?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.800
- Just go!
- I don't know.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.004
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.240
I'm looking for a woman
called Mombi.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.476
Hey!

13:31.478 --> 13:34.112
Careful.
Careful.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.415
It's gonna be okay.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.423
- My friend needs help.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.425
- Your friend is past
help.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.895
- No, I just...
I just need
antibiotics.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.263
Do you have any honey?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.566
What about goldenseal
or chaparral?

13:54.568 --> 13:57.535
Or onions, or...
- My herb patch is over
there.

13:57.537 --> 14:01.439
You can use what you can
find
and then be on your
way.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.374
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.559
- Miss?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.996
Forgive me, it was wrong
of me
not to offer help.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.065
Bring him inside.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.633
- Thank you.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.068
That's very kind of
you.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.137
- I've got just
the thing for him.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.236
- You're having
one of your days.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.938
- No, ma'am.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.307
- It's all right,
boy,
I know...

15:42.309 --> 15:44.475
it must be hard
sometimes,

15:44.477 --> 15:47.712
just being
cooped up in here.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.948
Who would want that?

15:49.950 --> 15:54.218
But with your
condition,
to be exposed to...

15:54.220 --> 15:57.055
all that's out
there...

15:58.725 --> 16:02.460
At least with this,
you're still alive.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.463
- Yes, ma'am.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.499
- I'm going to go
and check on our
guests.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.418
Ah, your potion
seems to be working.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.721
- It's just an herbal
remedy.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.357
- What kind of witch
are you?

16:32.359 --> 16:34.459
- I'm not.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.595
But I get that a lot
here.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.765
- And you?

16:40.767 --> 16:44.068
How long have you been
in the Wizard's Guard?

16:46.072 --> 16:47.572
- I...

16:47.574 --> 16:49.340
I don't know.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.110
- Cross stitched at
the hilt.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.278
Ceremonial hilt.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.216
Wizard's Guard!

17:00.320 --> 17:02.653
So...

17:02.655 --> 17:08.059
I have a not witch,
whose potions raise the
dead,

17:08.060 --> 17:12.195
and a not Wizard's
Guard
who carries their
sword.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.199
What else... are you
not?

17:15.201 --> 17:19.170
- I don't know
what you're asking.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.705
I don... I don't
remember anything.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.540
- Liar!

17:23.542 --> 17:26.743
- He's telling the
truth.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.746
When I found him in
Nimbo,
he was barely alive.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.281
- So it was you.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.583
- He couldn't even
remember his name.

17:32.585 --> 17:36.220
- I know what Wizard's
Guard
did at Nimbo.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.556
<i>Burned and tortured.</i>

17:38.558 --> 17:41.325
<i>I was there.
I saw.</i>

17:41.327 --> 17:44.328
- No, what they did to
those
people, they did to me,
too.

17:44.330 --> 17:48.399
- And yet you carry
their sword.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.702
Whatever you've done...

17:51.704 --> 17:54.605
however many you've
killed...

17:54.607 --> 17:58.242
whatever un... thinkable

17:58.244 --> 18:02.113
horror you
perpetrated...

18:02.115 --> 18:05.183
your mind has done
the same thing back...

18:05.185 --> 18:08.753
Made it <i> unthinkable.</i>

18:29.175 --> 18:31.809
- Dorian.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.578
- Dorian!

18:41.588 --> 18:43.588
Dorian.

18:51.598 --> 18:54.165
- Poor sod.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.610
- Lions.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.944
- Think how many
sisters

19:39.946 --> 19:42.380
have been sung to rest
here.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.482
- I'd rather not.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.388
- When this is done,
when we have what we
need,

19:50.390 --> 19:52.356
you can go back to
forgetting.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.562
- Am I interrupting?

20:00.633 --> 20:05.503
These doors... haven't
been
unsealed for a
generation.

20:05.505 --> 20:10.274
But I hear the ceremony
is beautiful.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.544
So I'm opening up
the funeral to the
public.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.949
I... I think it's time
that my people are
reminded

20:17.951 --> 20:20.618
<i>what Oz used to be.</i>

20:20.620 --> 20:22.353
Yeah.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.890
What witches... used to
be.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.537
- That lunatic
hopes to embarrass you.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.906
Us.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.813
- I'll be perfect.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.047
Toto!

21:26.419 --> 21:27.652
Toto.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.024
No!

21:33.026 --> 21:34.725
Go.

22:18.787 --> 22:20.103
- Who's up there?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.973
- Uh, I think it's
time for you
and the Wizard's Guard
to leave.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.976
- Why did they write
that?

22:27.046 --> 22:30.381
Tell me or I'm gonna
go get help.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.422
- It's a boy.
- It's just a...

22:38.424 --> 22:40.558
a sweet, sweet boy.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.760
Who's prone to
hysterics.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.829
- Who you keep locked
up.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.032
- Why do you think I
live
in a town with no name?

22:48.034 --> 22:51.669
A place on no map?

22:51.671 --> 22:53.003
It's to <i> protect him.</i>

22:53.005 --> 22:54.939
- From what?

22:54.941 --> 22:58.075
- From everything.

22:58.077 --> 23:03.047
I may not be his
mother, but I
feel what all mothers
feel.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.517
- What's that?
- Fear.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.052
All the time.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.821
In everything.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.923
From the minute they
are
born into the world,

23:12.925 --> 23:15.893
the world tries to
take them right back.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.695
- Well, you can't
protect him forever.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.998
- Didn't your mother
protect you?

23:25.772 --> 23:29.707
Don't you wish she had?

23:29.709 --> 23:32.042
Forever and always?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.625
Now you understand.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.464
We'll speak of it
no more.

24:27.233 --> 24:30.534
- Anna, is it?

24:30.536 --> 24:32.536
Where are the others?

24:32.538 --> 24:34.705
- They're preparing
for the funeral.

24:34.707 --> 24:38.642
- Not the best
circumstance
for your inaugural
time.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.212
- It gives me a chance
to familiarize myself

24:41.214 --> 24:42.646
with your science.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.948
- Must be overwhelming.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.084
- On the contrary,
it feels...

24:47.086 --> 24:48.953
like second nature.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.590
Numbers and patterns
and theorems...

24:52.592 --> 24:54.558
they're beautiful.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.695
As beautiful as magic.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.638
- Would you like to
join me
for the funeral?

25:09.775 --> 25:13.043
I hear it's quite a
show.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.250
- Out of my way.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.088
Get off of me!
Out of my way.

25:45.244 --> 25:48.279
- What did you do?

25:48.281 --> 25:51.882
- Nothing you need to
worry for.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.888
You let him do this to
you.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.791
- No one
does
anything to me.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.159
- I will...

26:02.161 --> 26:03.661
if you get this wrong.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.629
I will.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.748
Oh!

28:42.888 --> 28:44.955
- Which do you think I
am?

28:44.957 --> 28:47.257
A murderer or a
traitor?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.159
- It's not...
It's not like that.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.728
- Isn't it?

28:50.730 --> 28:53.030
- Like you said...

28:53.032 --> 28:55.199
who knows who you are.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.968
Or what you've done.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.504
- I don't know if it's
true.

29:01.874 --> 29:05.075
It doesn't feel like
me.

29:05.077 --> 29:09.313
Keep the sword, if it
puts your mind at ease.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.483
- Do you know what
would put me at ease?

29:12.485 --> 29:14.518
Us getting out of
here.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.259
- Lucas.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.061
What's wrong?

29:31.537 --> 29:32.803
- Oh, my God.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.338
Lucas...

29:34.340 --> 29:36.306
Lucas, you've been
poisoned.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.776
So I need you to put
your head
to the side and open
your mouth.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.778
Open your mouth!

29:40.780 --> 29:41.845
Keep it there, okay?

29:41.847 --> 29:43.514
Be right back.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.282
Stay with me, Lucas.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.383
Stay with me.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.851
Stay with me, Lucas.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.456
- Stay with me.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.429
- It's just charcoal.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.399
- It'll soak up the
poison.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.206
- You have to drink it
all.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.375
Swallow, Lucas,
swallow.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.311
Dorothy.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.880
Dorothy!

30:49.882 --> 30:51.148
Dorothy!

31:15.341 --> 31:17.140
- Did you get them?

31:17.142 --> 31:20.277
Are her spells inside
you?

31:47.139 --> 31:51.141
- You wretched waste.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.249
- My tongue...

31:59.251 --> 32:02.386
perfect.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.936
- Come on, we're
getting you
out of here.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.071
- We?
- Us.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.040
- Jack!

32:23.042 --> 32:24.174
- Hurry. Come on.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.442
- We have to get
out of here now.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.177
- Come on, come on!

32:27.179 --> 32:29.379
<i>- Tip! Tip...</i>

32:29.381 --> 32:31.415
<i>- Open the door!</i>
- I need my medicine.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.084
- Hurry up!
- We can't leave
without it.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.085
- Toto, go!

32:36.455 --> 32:37.688
- Come on.
- We have to go.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.323
- Damn it!

32:39.325 --> 32:40.457
There's not enough.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.525
- We can find more.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.527
<i>- Unlock the door!</i>

32:43.529 --> 32:45.529
- Oh, look.
- What is it?

32:45.531 --> 32:48.198
<i>Tip!</i>

32:48.200 --> 32:49.466
- No.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.634
I'm not stealing
from her.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.070
I don't want
any part of her.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.172
- Tip!
- Tip, wait!

32:57.042 --> 32:58.375
<i>- Let me out of here!</i>

32:58.377 --> 33:00.177
<i>Tip!
Tip!</i>

33:00.179 --> 33:01.244
<i>I order you!</i>

33:08.454 --> 33:10.620
- Come on!

33:41.487 --> 33:43.620
- Come on, Lucas.
- Come on.

33:45.758 --> 33:48.291
- What have you done
with him?
Where's the child?

33:48.293 --> 33:50.327
He's gone.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.332
You have no idea
what you've done!

33:55.334 --> 33:56.700
- He's free.

33:56.702 --> 34:01.571
I... was... protecting...
im!

34:01.573 --> 34:04.274
I was saving him!

34:04.276 --> 34:06.710
You... aah!

34:59.765 --> 35:00.797
- Lucas?

35:02.334 --> 35:03.500
- Lucas, stop.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.836
Lucas, stop!
Stop it, Lucas!

35:05.838 --> 35:07.170
Stop!

35:40.555 --> 35:42.405
- We'd have lived a year
on what
that dagger would have
sold for.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.707
Why'd she have it?

35:43.709 --> 35:45.208
- I don't know.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.444
She never told me
anything.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.147
But if I took it,
it would have been a
part of her

35:50.149 --> 35:52.616
that followed me
around.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.723
- You all right?

36:00.759 --> 36:02.792
- I need that medicine.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.794
What if it's the only
thing
keeping me alive?

36:04.796 --> 36:07.631
- She ever tell you
about that?
- Yeah.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.733
I got "bad blood."

36:09.735 --> 36:13.403
- Oh, heck,
who doesn't?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.410
- How is your sister?

36:53.412 --> 36:56.346
- Alive, no thanks to
you.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.515
- What she does,
she does to herself.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.551
- What she does, she
usually
does in private.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.854
For a ruler expecting
The Beast Forever,

37:04.856 --> 37:08.858
you spend the goodwill
of your friends
freely.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.894
- Am I your friend?

37:13.465 --> 37:16.666
Truly?

37:16.668 --> 37:19.402
I've outlawed your
gifts.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.938
My Eternal Warrior
stands poised

37:21.940 --> 37:24.407
to lay waste to your
temple.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.810
Mother South is dead.

37:26.812 --> 37:31.581
Which means there'll be
no more
witches born in Oz.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.722
How can you say
I'm your friend and
mean it?

37:40.626 --> 37:45.629
- You've saved Oz
when magic could not.

37:45.631 --> 37:50.400
You charged me with
selecting
your High Council.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.603
And I extended my hand.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.306
I always assumed
you'd taken it.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.378
- Safe travels north.

38:01.380 --> 38:05.015
I'm sure you'll have
less
fanfare on your
departure

38:05.017 --> 38:07.384
than you did on your
arrival.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.889
Go!

38:56.802 --> 38:58.768
- Knock, knock.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.108
Knock, knock.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.648
Knock, knock.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.147
Tip?

39:51.656 --> 39:52.989
Tip!

39:55.460 --> 39:56.926
Tip?

40:07.606 --> 40:10.039
Tip?

40:10.041 --> 40:12.175
Is that you?

40:12.177 --> 40:14.511
Hey, that's my friend's
coat!

40:17.082 --> 40:18.148
Stop!

40:21.953 --> 40:23.653
Stop!

40:23.655 --> 40:24.921
What're you doing
with that coat?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.856
- It's mine.

40:26.858 --> 40:29.793
It's
mine,
it's mine, it's mine.

40:29.795 --> 40:32.195
- What?

40:32.197 --> 40:34.164
It's me, Jack.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.632
Something's happened.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.600
- Tip?
