00:52.195 --> 00:54.949
<i>The second star to the right</i>

00:55.032 --> 00:58.828
<i>Shines in the night for you</i>

00:58.911 --> 01:02.291
<i>To tell you that the dreams you plan</i>

01:02.374 --> 01:06.629
<i>Really can come true</i>

01:06.713 --> 01:09.507
<i>The second star to the right</i>

01:09.591 --> 01:14.054
<i>Shines with a light so rare</i>

01:14.138 --> 01:18.059
<i>And if it's Never Land you need</i>

01:18.143 --> 01:22.189
<i>Its light will lead you there</i>

01:22.273 --> 01:25.152
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

01:25.235 --> 01:29.406
<i>So we'll know where you are</i>

01:29.489 --> 01:33.494
<i>Gleaming in the skies above</i>

01:33.578 --> 01:36.291
<i>Lead us to the land</i>

01:36.374 --> 01:40.838
<i>We dream of</i>

01:40.921 --> 01:45.135
<i>And when our journey is through</i>

01:45.218 --> 01:47.846
<i>Each time we say</i>

01:47.930 --> 01:50.892
<i>Good night</i>

01:50.975 --> 01:56.732
<i>We'll thank the little star
that shines</i>

01:57.816 --> 02:02.113
<i>The second from</i>

02:02.197 --> 02:05.660
<i>The right</i>

02:09.914 --> 02:12.376
All this has happened before.

02:12.459 --> 02:15.588
And it will all happen again.

02:15.672 --> 02:18.675
But this time
it happened in London.

02:21.428 --> 02:25.809
It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.

02:25.892 --> 02:30.731
That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.

02:30.815 --> 02:33.317
And Peter Pan chose
this particular house...

02:33.401 --> 02:37.072
because there were people
here who believed in him.

02:37.155 --> 02:40.535
There was Mrs Darling.

02:40.618 --> 02:44.622
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

02:44.706 --> 02:49.211
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.

02:49.295 --> 02:53.258
- But Mr Darling...
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links...

02:53.341 --> 02:55.469
we don't go to the party.

02:55.553 --> 02:59.724
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

02:59.807 --> 03:01.727
And if I can never... Ouch!

03:01.810 --> 03:05.691
Well, Mr Darling
was a practical man.

03:05.774 --> 03:09.028
The boys, however,
John and Michael...

03:09.111 --> 03:11.531
believed Peter Pan
was a real person...

03:11.615 --> 03:15.244
and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.371
Blast you, Peter Pan!

03:19.457 --> 03:23.128
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?

03:23.211 --> 03:26.341
Never! I'll teach you
to cut off me hand!

03:26.424 --> 03:29.761
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.972
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.

03:32.056 --> 03:36.102
Wendy, the eldest,
not only believed...

03:36.186 --> 03:38.772
she was the supreme authority
on Peter Pan...

03:38.855 --> 03:40.775
and all his
marvellous adventures.

03:40.858 --> 03:44.612
Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

03:44.695 --> 03:48.033
Nana, the nursemaid,
being a dog...

03:48.116 --> 03:50.620
kept her opinions to herself...

03:50.703 --> 03:54.207
and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.

04:01.299 --> 04:02.801
Take that!

04:02.968 --> 04:06.180
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!

04:06.305 --> 04:09.100
And I'll cut you to pieces.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.687
- Aha!
- Ouch!

04:11.770 --> 04:15.858
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

04:15.942 --> 04:18.444
You'll never leave
this ship alive!

04:18.528 --> 04:22.031
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!

04:27.956 --> 04:31.878
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

04:31.962 --> 04:33.797
Oh, no, you won't.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.176
Back, back, back, you villain!

04:37.260 --> 04:40.514
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

04:40.597 --> 04:45.395
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either. You never touched me.

04:45.478 --> 04:49.232
Take that and that!
And that!

04:49.316 --> 04:51.527
Boys, boys,
less noise, please.

04:54.447 --> 04:57.534
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

04:57.617 --> 05:00.120
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael...

05:00.203 --> 05:03.958
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

05:04.042 --> 05:07.046
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

05:07.129 --> 05:09.798
Uh, have you seen my cuff...

05:09.882 --> 05:12.802
Oh, Nana,
for goodness sake!

05:12.886 --> 05:15.556
Where are those cuff links?

05:15.640 --> 05:19.977
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.231
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

05:23.315 --> 05:25.443
- I don't know.
- The map then.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.571
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

05:28.655 --> 05:31.867
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

05:31.950 --> 05:34.536
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.916
And hereafter...
Don't paw me, Michael.

05:37.999 --> 05:43.255
This is my last clean...
No! No!

05:43.339 --> 05:46.093
George, dear, we really must
hurry or we'll be late...

05:46.176 --> 05:49.930
- Mary, look!
- George.

05:50.013 --> 05:53.267
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

05:53.351 --> 05:56.271
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.

05:56.355 --> 05:59.484
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

05:59.567 --> 06:04.323
I might have known. Wendy!

06:04.407 --> 06:07.202
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

06:07.285 --> 06:10.372
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

06:10.456 --> 06:13.626
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.963
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

06:16.046 --> 06:19.466
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

06:19.550 --> 06:23.388
- I'd like...
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?

06:23.471 --> 06:27.393
What have I... Oh!

06:27.476 --> 06:32.357
- Now, George, really. It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.

06:32.441 --> 06:37.488
Wendy, haven't I warned you? Stuffing the
boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.

06:37.572 --> 06:40.408
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.

06:40.491 --> 06:42.995
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!

06:43.078 --> 06:47.542
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

06:47.625 --> 06:49.669
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you...
- Oh, you don't understand.

06:49.753 --> 06:54.550
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

06:54.633 --> 06:58.221
- Now, George.
- "Now, George".

06:58.305 --> 07:00.432
"Now, George"!

07:00.515 --> 07:03.269
Well, "Now, George,"
will have his say!

07:03.353 --> 07:07.524
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.

07:07.608 --> 07:09.943
It's high time she had
a room of her own.

07:10.027 --> 07:12.364
- Father!
- George!
- What?

07:12.447 --> 07:15.575
- No!
- I mean it!

07:15.659 --> 07:19.372
Young lady, this is your
last night in the nursery.

07:19.455 --> 07:22.542
And that's my last word
on the matter...

07:35.643 --> 07:38.020
No!

07:39.980 --> 07:41.566
No!

07:49.492 --> 07:52.913
Oh!

07:55.082 --> 07:57.377
Poor Nana.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.046
"Poor Nana"?

08:00.130 --> 08:02.425
This is the last straw!

08:02.508 --> 08:04.844
Out! Out, I say!

08:04.927 --> 08:07.848
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

08:07.931 --> 08:11.019
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

08:12.437 --> 08:14.188
Goodbye, Nana.

08:16.108 --> 08:20.237
"Poor Nana".
Oh, yes, "Poor Nana".

08:20.320 --> 08:24.284
But "Poor Father"?
Oh, no!

08:24.367 --> 08:26.871
Blast it!
Where is that rope?

08:28.122 --> 08:31.209
Oh, thank you.

08:35.172 --> 08:38.092
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

08:38.176 --> 08:40.553
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...

08:42.056 --> 08:43.974
Well, you're not really
a nurse at all.

08:44.058 --> 08:47.145
You're, well, a dog.

08:47.228 --> 08:50.315
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

08:50.398 --> 08:54.488
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

08:54.571 --> 08:57.492
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.

08:57.575 --> 09:01.830
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

09:01.914 --> 09:05.834
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock".

09:05.919 --> 09:10.673
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

09:10.757 --> 09:15.429
Poor Nana,
out there all alone.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.558
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.852
She'll be all right.

09:20.937 --> 09:23.690
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

09:23.773 --> 09:27.611
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

09:27.695 --> 09:30.280
Don't judge your father
too harshly.

09:30.364 --> 09:34.703
After all, he really
loves you very much.

09:34.786 --> 09:37.415
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

09:37.498 --> 09:41.169
- "He"?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.

09:41.253 --> 09:45.340
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

09:45.424 --> 09:49.220
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.

09:49.303 --> 09:52.766
- "Shadow"?
- Mmm, Nana had it.

09:52.850 --> 09:55.894
But I...
I took it away.

09:57.397 --> 10:02.403
Oh? Yes, of course.

10:02.486 --> 10:04.822
Good night, dear.

10:07.159 --> 10:10.912
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

10:10.997 --> 10:13.291
Safe? Of course
they'll be safe. Why not?

10:13.374 --> 10:16.754
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I...

10:16.837 --> 10:19.631
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

10:19.715 --> 10:23.304
Oh, Peter Pan...
Peter Pan!

10:23.387 --> 10:28.143
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

10:28.226 --> 10:30.270
- But, George... Really, I...
- Sound the alarm!

10:30.353 --> 10:33.191
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

10:33.274 --> 10:36.695
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

10:37.029 --> 10:41.451
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the
children to grow up and be practical...

10:41.534 --> 10:43.995
- George, dear.
- When you're as bad as they are.

10:44.079 --> 10:46.957
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.580
Over there, Tink,
in its den.

11:20.664 --> 11:23.501
Is it there?

11:25.336 --> 11:27.673
Must be here somewhere.

11:33.304 --> 11:36.015
Tink! Shh!

11:36.099 --> 11:40.187
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

11:40.271 --> 11:43.442
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

12:09.974 --> 12:12.728
Huh?

12:30.916 --> 12:32.418
Aha!

12:41.930 --> 12:46.142
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

12:46.226 --> 12:49.647
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.817
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.569
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

12:54.653 --> 12:57.365
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then...

12:57.448 --> 13:00.451
Oh, you can't stick it
on with soap, Peter.

13:00.535 --> 13:03.455
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.958
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.002
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean. Of course, I

13:08.003 --> 13:10.213
knew it was your shadow
the minute I saw it.

13:10.296 --> 13:13.551
And I said to myself, I said, "I'll
put it away for him until he comes back.

13:13.634 --> 13:17.640
Oh, he's sure to come back".
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

13:17.723 --> 13:19.559
After all, one can't leave his shadow

13:19.560 --> 13:21.854
lying about and not
miss it sooner or later.

13:21.937 --> 13:24.398
Uh, don't you agree?
But what I still don't

13:24.399 --> 13:27.152
understand is how Nana
got it in the first place.

13:27.235 --> 13:30.321
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

13:30.405 --> 13:33.409
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.870
- Although Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

13:35.953 --> 13:39.499
Yes, girls talk too...
Hmm? Oh.

13:39.583 --> 13:43.212
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.

13:43.296 --> 13:46.340
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

13:46.424 --> 13:50.095
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?

13:50.179 --> 13:52.849
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.517
Well, what were
you doing there?

13:54.601 --> 13:58.606
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?

13:58.689 --> 14:01.025
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.404
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

14:04.488 --> 14:07.366
The Lost Boys...
Oh, I remember.

14:07.450 --> 14:09.243
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.

14:09.327 --> 14:13.373
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.

14:13.457 --> 14:15.876
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

14:15.959 --> 14:19.172
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

14:19.255 --> 14:22.218
But that means
no more stories.

14:22.301 --> 14:24.804
- Mm-hmm.
- No!

14:24.887 --> 14:27.057
I won't have it.
Come on!

14:27.140 --> 14:29.226
Bu-Bu-But
where are we going?

14:29.309 --> 14:32.230
To Never Land.

14:32.313 --> 14:35.108
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

14:35.191 --> 14:39.655
Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

14:39.738 --> 14:43.326
But wait.
What would Mother say?

14:43.409 --> 14:45.329
Mother? What's Mother?

14:45.412 --> 14:50.460
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...
who loves and cares for you.

14:50.544 --> 14:53.965
- And... And tells you stories...
- Good! You can be our mother.

14:54.048 --> 14:55.967
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I...

14:56.050 --> 14:58.387
Let me see now.
L-I have to pack.

14:58.470 --> 15:01.683
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be
back. Of course, I couldn't stay too long.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.936
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

15:05.019 --> 15:07.690
Oh, I...
I-I'm so happy I...

15:07.773 --> 15:11.444
I think I'll give you a... a kiss.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.116
What's a... a kiss?

15:16.199 --> 15:19.704
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.

15:19.787 --> 15:21.832
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!

15:27.005 --> 15:30.133
John, John, wake up!
He's here.

15:30.216 --> 15:34.013
Huh? Jiminy!

15:34.096 --> 15:36.390
Ooh, what in the world was that?

15:36.474 --> 15:38.810
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.188
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.

15:41.271 --> 15:43.983
And my name is John.
How do you do?

15:44.066 --> 15:47.070
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.531
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

15:52.410 --> 15:55.163
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.250
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

16:00.252 --> 16:03.799
Oh. Well, I think
she's lovely.

16:05.467 --> 16:08.638
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

16:08.721 --> 16:10.932
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

16:11.015 --> 16:13.019
- Peter's taking us.
- "Us"?

16:13.102 --> 16:16.523
Well, of course. L-I couldn't
go without Michael and John.

16:16.606 --> 16:20.361
Oh, I should like very much to cross
swords with some real buccaneers.

16:20.444 --> 16:24.533
Yes, and fight pirates too.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.703
Well, all right,
but ya gotta take orders.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.206
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

16:30.414 --> 16:32.876
But, Peter, how do
we get to Never Land?

16:32.960 --> 16:35.712
- Fly, of course.
- "Fly"?

16:35.796 --> 16:40.385
It's easy. All you
have to do is to... is to...

16:40.468 --> 16:43.472
Is to...

16:43.556 --> 16:46.392
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?

16:46.475 --> 16:48.562
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.

16:48.645 --> 16:52.066
It's... It's just that
I never thought about it before.

16:52.150 --> 16:55.611
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

16:55.695 --> 16:58.449
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.

16:58.532 --> 17:01.743
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

17:01.827 --> 17:04.455
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!

17:05.665 --> 17:08.294
It's easier than pie.

17:08.377 --> 17:11.088
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

17:11.172 --> 17:13.800
He flewed!

17:13.884 --> 17:18.138
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon...

17:19.182 --> 17:21.767
underneath a magic moon.

17:21.851 --> 17:24.146
I'll think I'm
in a pirate's cave.

17:24.229 --> 17:26.147
I think I'll be
an Indian brave.

17:26.231 --> 17:28.151
Now everybody try.

17:28.233 --> 17:31.529
One, two, three!

17:31.613 --> 17:35.534
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!

17:42.586 --> 17:45.172
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

17:45.255 --> 17:48.718
All it takes
is faith and trust.

17:48.802 --> 17:52.765
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!

17:52.848 --> 17:55.518
- Dust?
- Dust?

17:55.601 --> 18:00.816
Yep, just a little bit
of pixie dust.

18:06.072 --> 18:09.326
Now, think of
the happiest things.

18:09.409 --> 18:12.747
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

18:12.831 --> 18:15.041
Look! We're rising off the floor.

18:15.124 --> 18:18.879
- Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!

18:18.963 --> 18:23.385
- You can fly!
- We can fly!

18:23.593 --> 18:28.057
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!

18:28.141 --> 18:29.559
Off to Never Land!

18:35.774 --> 18:38.570
<i>Think of a wonderful thought</i>

18:38.653 --> 18:41.364
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

18:41.447 --> 18:43.784
<i>Think of Christmas
Think of snow</i>

18:43.868 --> 18:48.707
<i>Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky</i>

18:48.790 --> 18:53.045
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

18:53.129 --> 18:56.215
<i>Think of the happiest things</i>

18:56.299 --> 18:58.969
<i>It's the same as having wings</i>

18:59.052 --> 19:01.305
<i>Take the path that moonbeams make</i>

19:01.388 --> 19:06.812
<i>If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye</i>

19:06.896 --> 19:10.734
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

19:11.985 --> 19:14.071
<i>Up you go with a heigh and ho</i>

19:14.155 --> 19:16.365
<i>To the stars beyond the blue</i>

19:16.449 --> 19:20.078
<i>There's a Never Land
waiting for you</i>

19:20.162 --> 19:24.792
<i>Where all your
happy dreams come true</i>

19:24.876 --> 19:30.424
<i>Every dream that you dream
will come true</i>

19:30.508 --> 19:32.719
Come on, Nana!

19:32.802 --> 19:36.306
<i>When there's a smile
in your heart</i>

19:36.389 --> 19:41.979
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

19:42.063 --> 19:44.316
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

19:44.399 --> 19:49.405
<i>When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye</i>

19:49.489 --> 19:52.660
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly</i>

19:52.743 --> 19:55.120
<i>You can fly</i>

20:04.298 --> 20:08.554
There it is, Wendy. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

20:11.223 --> 20:14.435
<i>When there's
a smile in your heart</i>

20:14.519 --> 20:18.983
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

20:20.901 --> 20:24.865
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find
when you leave the world behind</i>

20:24.948 --> 20:28.578
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

20:28.661 --> 20:31.873
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly</i>

20:31.956 --> 20:34.502
<i>You can fly</i>

20:34.586 --> 20:37.213
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

20:50.688 --> 20:54.943
<i>Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life</i>

20:55.027 --> 20:58.865
<i>A- rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

20:58.948 --> 21:02.243
<i>It's the life
of a pirate for me, oh</i>

21:02.327 --> 21:04.830
<i>The life of a pirate for me</i>

21:06.207 --> 21:10.003
<i>Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life</i>

21:10.086 --> 21:11.963
<i>They never bury your bones</i>

21:12.047 --> 21:15.885
<i>For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones</i>

21:15.968 --> 21:20.224
<i>Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones</i>

21:20.307 --> 21:25.563
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

21:25.647 --> 21:30.069
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

21:30.152 --> 21:33.990
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

21:34.074 --> 21:35.867
Look out. It might go off.

21:35.951 --> 21:39.247
We ought to be tending to
the business of looting ships.

21:39.330 --> 21:43.794
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

21:43.877 --> 21:46.797
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain...

21:46.880 --> 21:49.592
we wants to put to sea, see?

21:54.098 --> 21:56.016
Peter Pan...

21:58.311 --> 22:01.691
Blast that Peter Pan!

22:01.774 --> 22:05.946
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

22:06.029 --> 22:08.116
But where is it?

22:08.199 --> 22:10.785
Mermaid Lagoon?

22:10.869 --> 22:13.789
No, we've searched that.

22:13.873 --> 22:17.543
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

22:17.626 --> 22:20.672
H-Here! No. No, no, no!

22:20.755 --> 22:24.093
That's Indian terri...

22:24.176 --> 22:26.095
But wait.

22:26.178 --> 22:31.059
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.062
Ah...

22:33.146 --> 22:35.982
I wonder.

22:36.065 --> 22:38.652
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!

22:38.736 --> 22:40.487
Tiger Lily, Smee!

22:40.571 --> 22:42.991
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?

22:43.074 --> 22:46.995
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

22:47.078 --> 22:50.082
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?

22:50.166 --> 22:54.671
Oh, a little persuasion
might be in order.

22:54.755 --> 22:56.965
Now let me see.

22:57.049 --> 23:00.011
Boiling in oil?

23:00.094 --> 23:04.141
Keelhauling? Marooning?

23:04.225 --> 23:08.688
A pirate's life
is a wonderful I-life

23:08.772 --> 23:13.027
<i>You'll find adventure and sport</i>

23:13.110 --> 23:16.864
<i>But live every minute
for all that is in it</i>

23:16.948 --> 23:22.538
<i>The life of a pirate is short</i>

23:22.621 --> 23:27.377
<i>Oh, the life...</i>

23:33.511 --> 23:35.471
Now let me see, where was I?

23:35.555 --> 23:37.848
Oh, dear, dear,
dear Captain Hook.

23:37.933 --> 23:41.186
Shooting a man in
the middle of his cadenza?

23:41.270 --> 23:43.731
It ain't good form, you know.

23:43.815 --> 23:48.279
"Good form," Mr Smee?
Blast good form!

23:48.362 --> 23:52.199
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

23:52.283 --> 23:56.997
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.251
Aye! But throwing it
to the crocodile!

24:00.334 --> 24:03.338
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well...

24:03.422 --> 24:06.925
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops...

24:07.009 --> 24:09.637
for the rest of me.

24:09.721 --> 24:12.098
And he'd have had
you by now, Captain...

24:12.181 --> 24:14.602
if he hadn't swallowed
that alarm clock.

24:14.685 --> 24:19.232
But now when he's about, he warns ya
as ya might say with his tick-tock...

24:19.316 --> 24:21.359
tick-tock, tick-tock.

24:51.395 --> 24:54.858
Smee? Smee!

24:54.942 --> 24:57.028
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

24:57.111 --> 25:00.407
Please, don't let him
get me, Smee! Smee!

25:00.491 --> 25:03.995
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.

25:04.079 --> 25:06.831
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

25:06.915 --> 25:10.378
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

25:14.841 --> 25:18.263
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.

25:18.346 --> 25:21.391
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

25:21.474 --> 25:23.852
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

25:23.936 --> 25:27.356
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.

25:27.439 --> 25:29.901
What you need is a shave.

25:29.985 --> 25:34.699
A nice soothing shave.
There now.

25:34.907 --> 25:38.412
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

25:38.495 --> 25:41.832
A- sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a...

25:41.915 --> 25:44.586
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'...

25:44.669 --> 25:49.258
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.343
Give me a career as a buccaneer

25:51.427 --> 25:53.930
And the crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, Captain.

25:54.014 --> 25:56.349
That is,
what's left of it.

25:59.395 --> 26:03.065
Now, why don't we put
to sea, see? Leave Never Land.

26:03.149 --> 26:07.070
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!

26:07.154 --> 26:09.574
Give me a career as a buccaneer

26:09.657 --> 26:13.621
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

26:18.125 --> 26:22.380
Captain? Oh, dear! I never
shaved him this close before.

26:26.178 --> 26:29.849
Now, don't worry, Captain.
L-It must be somewhere about.

26:31.267 --> 26:33.812
Get up, you idiot!

26:33.896 --> 26:36.357
Aye, aye, sir.

26:37.733 --> 26:40.278
Ooh! I found it, Captain.

26:40.362 --> 26:44.283
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!

26:44.367 --> 26:48.372
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

26:48.455 --> 26:51.833
Three points off
the starboard bow!

26:51.917 --> 26:54.462
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!

26:54.545 --> 26:57.757
Headed this way with
some more of those scurvy brats!

26:57.840 --> 26:59.843
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

26:59.927 --> 27:02.638
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up
the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.350
All hands on deck!

27:05.433 --> 27:08.144
All hands on deck!

27:08.228 --> 27:10.231
All hands on deck!

27:12.066 --> 27:13.986
All hands on deck!

27:16.405 --> 27:18.908
Look alive, you swabs!

27:18.992 --> 27:22.829
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.

27:22.912 --> 27:27.126
Man the Long Tom,
you bilge rats!

27:27.209 --> 27:30.630
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.

27:30.714 --> 27:33.008
Double the powder
and shorten the fuse!

27:33.091 --> 27:35.344
Shorten the powder
and double the fuse!

27:35.511 --> 27:36.512
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.

27:36.596 --> 27:39.182
We'll pot 'em
like sitting ducks.

27:39.266 --> 27:43.521
- All right, men! Range 42.
- "Range 42".

27:43.605 --> 27:47.025
- Elevation 65.
- "Elevation 65".

27:47.108 --> 27:49.862
- Three degrees west.
- "Three degrees west".

27:49.945 --> 27:55.286
Steady now! Steady!

27:55.453 --> 27:59.207
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.752
Oh, look, John,
there's Mermaid Lagoon.

28:01.835 --> 28:06.716
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!

28:06.799 --> 28:09.887
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.

28:12.723 --> 28:15.060
Look out!

28:16.978 --> 28:19.148
Quick, Tink, take Wendy
and the boys to the island.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.610
I'll stay here
and draw Hook's fire.

28:24.154 --> 28:28.241
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!

28:33.791 --> 28:39.214
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

28:39.297 --> 28:42.175
We can't keep up with you.

28:42.259 --> 28:45.429
Tinker Bell! Wait!

29:07.872 --> 29:09.333
Ouch!

29:11.252 --> 29:14.006
So!

29:15.841 --> 29:18.846
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!

29:18.929 --> 29:21.307
I'll show you!

29:27.105 --> 29:29.859
Huh? Orders from Pan?

29:29.942 --> 29:32.903
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

29:34.823 --> 29:38.493
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- "Wendy Bird"?

29:38.577 --> 29:42.415
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are...

29:42.498 --> 29:45.085
What? Smash it?

29:45.169 --> 29:47.504
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

29:49.341 --> 29:52.052
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!

29:52.135 --> 29:54.513
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!

29:54.597 --> 29:58.184
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

30:14.955 --> 30:17.540
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!

30:17.624 --> 30:21.087
Ready, aim...

30:21.170 --> 30:23.089
fire!

30:34.979 --> 30:38.900
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.

30:41.027 --> 30:44.490
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.577
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

30:47.661 --> 30:52.250
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

30:54.420 --> 30:58.299
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

30:58.382 --> 31:01.594
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

31:03.513 --> 31:07.059
Attention! Well...

31:07.143 --> 31:11.481
I'm certainly proud of you,
you blockheads!

31:11.565 --> 31:15.611
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories...
- A mother?

31:15.695 --> 31:20.034
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

31:20.117 --> 31:24.831
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!

31:24.914 --> 31:29.045
Tinker Bell. Tink!

31:29.128 --> 31:34.301
Come here. You're charged
with high treason, Tink.

31:34.384 --> 31:38.180
Are you guilty or not guilty?

31:38.263 --> 31:41.809
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

31:44.229 --> 31:46.774
Tinker Bell!

31:46.857 --> 31:51.154
I hereby banish you forever.

31:51.237 --> 31:53.740
Please, not forever.

31:53.823 --> 31:57.745
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.582
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?

32:00.666 --> 32:03.418
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

32:03.502 --> 32:05.421
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

32:05.838 --> 32:08.174
Personally, I should prefer
to see the aborigines.

32:08.257 --> 32:11.470
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!

32:11.553 --> 32:14.225
Go out and capture
a few Indians.

32:14.308 --> 32:18.312
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

32:18.396 --> 32:20.357
Forward! March!

32:22.943 --> 32:26.864
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.

32:26.948 --> 32:29.368
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

32:35.875 --> 32:39.213
<i>Following the leader
The leader, the leader</i>

32:39.296 --> 32:42.967

<i>Tee dum, tee dee

32:50.351 --> 32:53.604
<i>Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say</i>

32:53.688 --> 32:57.443
<i>Just a teedle ee dum

<i>Oh, a teedle ee dum

33:59.686 --> 34:04.023
Indians!
Oh, Blackfoot tribe.

34:05.693 --> 34:08.654
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

34:08.737 --> 34:11.157
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.

34:11.241 --> 34:14.704
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

34:14.911 --> 34:18.331
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?

34:18.416 --> 34:23.797
A plan of attack. The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

34:51.456 --> 34:55.585
John! Indians! Indians!

34:55.668 --> 34:57.963
Let me in!

35:00.800 --> 35:02.927
Now remember,
the Indian is cunning...

35:03.011 --> 35:05.139
- Hey...
- but not intelligent.

35:05.222 --> 35:08.642
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise...

35:40.516 --> 35:44.269
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

35:44.353 --> 35:48.400
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.

35:48.483 --> 35:50.152
That's okay.

35:54.323 --> 35:57.494
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!

35:57.577 --> 36:02.041
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

36:02.125 --> 36:05.629
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.

36:05.713 --> 36:08.841
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.

36:08.924 --> 36:11.845
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.

36:11.928 --> 36:15.224
"Turn us loose"?
You mean this is only a game?

36:15.307 --> 36:17.476
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.688
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.

36:19.771 --> 36:22.315
This time, no turn 'em loose.

36:22.399 --> 36:24.317
- Huh?
- Huh?

36:24.401 --> 36:28.114
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.

36:28.197 --> 36:30.576
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?

36:30.659 --> 36:35.331
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.

36:35.415 --> 36:39.671
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.

36:39.755 --> 36:43.633
If Tiger Lily
not back by sunset...

36:43.717 --> 36:47.180
burn 'em at stake.

37:06.078 --> 37:10.041
Just imagine,
real live mermaids.

37:10.124 --> 37:13.002
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.

37:13.086 --> 37:15.172
All right, come on.

37:17.216 --> 37:20.887
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!

37:20.970 --> 37:23.681
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!

37:23.765 --> 37:25.893
Hello, Peter!

37:29.021 --> 37:32.359
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.

37:32.442 --> 37:36.906
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

37:36.989 --> 37:40.119
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

37:40.202 --> 37:43.497
Want to hear about the time I cut off
Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?

37:43.580 --> 37:47.210
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

37:47.293 --> 37:49.964
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

37:50.047 --> 37:52.425
- Oh, Peter!
- By 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?

37:52.508 --> 37:56.054
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.

37:56.138 --> 37:58.682
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

37:58.765 --> 38:01.602
And in her nightdress too.

38:01.686 --> 38:04.606
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.

38:04.690 --> 38:06.776
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!

38:06.860 --> 38:08.611
- We insist!
- No, no, please!

38:08.695 --> 38:12.616
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!

38:19.207 --> 38:23.129
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

38:23.212 --> 38:25.966
They were just having a little fun,
weren't you, girls?

38:26.050 --> 38:30.305
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

38:30.388 --> 38:33.308
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...

38:33.391 --> 38:36.604
- that I'm going to put up with a...
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.

38:42.152 --> 38:46.157
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!

38:46.240 --> 38:48.201
Hook! Oh!

38:48.284 --> 38:51.080
Quick, Wendy.

38:53.415 --> 38:56.086
They've captured Tiger Lily.

39:09.309 --> 39:11.187
Looks like they're
headin' for Skull Rock.

39:11.270 --> 39:14.690
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.

39:29.458 --> 39:33.506
Now, me dear Princess,
this is me proposition.

39:33.589 --> 39:37.886
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan...

39:37.970 --> 39:39.888
and I shall set you free.

39:39.972 --> 39:42.851
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

39:42.934 --> 39:45.896
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

39:45.980 --> 39:49.400
Oh, yes, always, Captain.

39:49.483 --> 39:54.030
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in...

39:54.114 --> 39:56.075
and then it will be too late.

39:56.159 --> 40:00.581
- I'll show the old codfish. Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- "Fun"?

40:01.582 --> 40:03.000
Remember...

40:03.083 --> 40:06.254
there is no path
through water...

40:06.337 --> 40:09.090
to the happy hunting ground.

40:10.634 --> 40:13.512
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!

40:13.596 --> 40:18.101
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

40:19.811 --> 40:22.648
Beware, Captain Hook!

40:22.732 --> 40:25.277
Beware! Beware!

40:25.360 --> 40:29.239
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.

40:29.323 --> 40:33.453
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

40:33.536 --> 40:36.957
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

40:50.307 --> 40:53.894
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.

40:56.481 --> 40:59.985
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?

41:00.069 --> 41:05.326
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

41:06.577 --> 41:09.664
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess...

41:09.747 --> 41:14.628
- But... But, Captain...
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

41:14.711 --> 41:16.965
Aye, aye, sir.

41:20.594 --> 41:23.931
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

41:24.014 --> 41:27.144
I told him all along you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

41:27.227 --> 41:31.774
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

41:31.858 --> 41:36.029
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

41:36.113 --> 41:40.785
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain. Didn't you just say to go...

41:40.869 --> 41:44.372
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!

41:44.456 --> 41:50.171
- My orders. Of all the bumbling...
- Mr Smee!

41:50.254 --> 41:53.467
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

41:53.550 --> 41:56.095
Putting her back
like you said, Captain.

41:56.179 --> 41:58.389
I said nothing of the sort!

41:58.473 --> 42:01.435
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that...

42:01.518 --> 42:03.562
For the last time, Mr Smee.

42:03.645 --> 42:07.817
Take the princess
back to her people.

42:07.901 --> 42:12.990
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?

42:13.073 --> 42:17.037
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.

42:17.120 --> 42:20.248
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew...

42:20.332 --> 42:23.044
to help themselves
to me best rum.

42:24.587 --> 42:28.676
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!

42:29.677 --> 42:31.847
Why, it's Peter Pan.

42:34.725 --> 42:37.104
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.

42:37.187 --> 42:41.109
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

42:41.192 --> 42:44.529
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.

42:57.837 --> 43:00.674
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

43:02.217 --> 43:05.680
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

43:05.763 --> 43:08.307
Right here, Mr Smee.

43:08.391 --> 43:11.562
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!

43:15.065 --> 43:17.819
Captain?

43:17.902 --> 43:19.821
Oh, how dreadful.

43:19.904 --> 43:24.827
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.

43:27.581 --> 43:29.749
Captain!

43:29.833 --> 43:31.586
In the back, Captain?

43:38.594 --> 43:40.638
Give it to him, Captain!

43:40.722 --> 43:43.516
Cleave him to the brisket.

43:55.323 --> 43:59.036
I've got you this time, Pan.

44:03.249 --> 44:07.379
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

44:07.463 --> 44:11.843
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

44:13.762 --> 44:16.808
I say, Captain,
do you hear something?

44:16.891 --> 44:19.143
No.

44:19.769 --> 44:21.146
No!

44:25.985 --> 44:27.987
No!

44:29.781 --> 44:32.993
Mr Crocodile,
do you like codfish?

44:33.077 --> 44:35.496
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

44:43.673 --> 44:45.508
No!

44:47.177 --> 44:49.596
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!

44:49.680 --> 44:53.143
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.

44:56.021 --> 44:58.190
Smee!

44:59.066 --> 45:00.609
Smee!

45:06.033 --> 45:09.537
Smee!

45:12.040 --> 45:13.750
Ow!

45:16.629 --> 45:18.548
Captain! Captain!

45:18.631 --> 45:22.429
Smee! Smee!

45:22.512 --> 45:24.431
- Give him back!
- Smee...

45:27.268 --> 45:31.565
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship...

45:34.151 --> 45:35.904
Whoa!

45:39.449 --> 45:42.745
Smee!

45:44.580 --> 45:47.501
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

45:47.584 --> 45:50.128
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.

45:52.089 --> 45:54.342
Help...

46:00.849 --> 46:04.479
Peter. Wait for me.

46:33.229 --> 46:36.859
That cursed Peter Pan.

46:38.235 --> 46:40.988
Making a fool out of me.

46:47.413 --> 46:50.292
Oh, my head.

46:55.923 --> 46:59.762
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

46:59.845 --> 47:02.223
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!

47:02.307 --> 47:05.185
The poor Captain
has a splitting headache.

47:05.268 --> 47:08.481
We mustn't annoy him.

47:25.626 --> 47:30.340
Well, Captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

47:30.423 --> 47:34.929
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

47:35.012 --> 47:38.391
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain...

47:38.475 --> 47:40.894
why don't we put to sea again?

47:40.977 --> 47:44.232
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

47:44.315 --> 47:46.235
Women trouble.

47:46.318 --> 47:49.613
I wouldn't want this
to go any farther, but...

47:49.696 --> 47:53.576
the cook told me that
the first mate told him...

47:53.660 --> 47:57.998
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

47:58.082 --> 48:01.085
Whoa!

48:01.168 --> 48:06.509
Why, you doddering imbecile, I...
Did you say Pan...

48:06.592 --> 48:09.303
has banished Tinker Bell?

48:09.387 --> 48:11.097
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.976
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.

48:14.059 --> 48:18.107
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

48:18.190 --> 48:22.571
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.

48:22.654 --> 48:25.782
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

48:25.866 --> 48:28.453
That's it, Smee!
That's it!

48:28.536 --> 48:30.496
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.

48:30.580 --> 48:33.625
Quick, me coat.

48:33.709 --> 48:36.295
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner

Ah, yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything.

48:40.759 --> 48:43.345
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

48:43.429 --> 48:46.223
Here you are, sir.

48:46.307 --> 48:49.936

our course to a...

48:53.149 --> 48:55.985
certain hiding place.

48:56.068 --> 48:58.655
Our best hiding place
is the Spanish main, sir.

48:58.739 --> 49:00.991
I'll set our course...

49:01.074 --> 49:05.747
And where do you think
you are going?

49:05.830 --> 49:09.001
T-To tell the boys

49:40.831 --> 49:45.045
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

49:45.129 --> 49:48.716
- What's he saying?
- He says...

49:48.800 --> 49:52.388
"Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

49:52.471 --> 49:54.557
"Save Tiger Lily.

49:54.640 --> 49:58.395
Make big Chief heap glad".

49:58.478 --> 50:01.732
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad".

50:01.816 --> 50:05.903
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

50:05.987 --> 50:08.740

Uh, what makes the red man red?

50:40.028 --> 50:42.281

- First say, "Ugh"?

50:42.364 --> 50:44.617
Why does he ask you, "How"?

50:44.700 --> 50:47.954
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

50:48.038 --> 50:51.667

53:02.326 --> 53:04.495
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell...

53:04.578 --> 53:07.499
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

53:21.473 --> 53:24.978
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

53:26.771 --> 53:31.527
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

53:31.610 --> 53:34.990
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

53:40.204 --> 53:42.708
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear...

53:42.791 --> 53:46.295
to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.

53:48.089 --> 53:52.595
Oh, Pan has his faults,
to be sure.

53:52.678 --> 53:55.598
Uh, bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

53:55.681 --> 53:57.601
Dangerous business, that.

54:01.146 --> 54:06.737
Why, rumour has it that already
she has come between you and Peter.

54:10.783 --> 54:14.997
But what's this?
Tears?

54:15.080 --> 54:19.377
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.

54:19.461 --> 54:22.548
The way of a man with a maid.

54:22.632 --> 54:27.387
Taking the best years
of her life and then...

54:27.471 --> 54:31.892
casting her aside
like an old glove!

54:31.975 --> 54:34.896
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

54:34.979 --> 54:39.235
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.

54:39.318 --> 54:43.031
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

54:43.114 --> 54:47.077
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.664
But how?

54:49.747 --> 54:53.335
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

54:53.418 --> 54:56.463
Sail! That's it, Smee!

54:58.925 --> 55:03.055
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- "Shanghai Wendy," Captain?

55:03.138 --> 55:05.641
Take her to sea with us. With her gone,

55:05.642 --> 55:08.603
Peter will soon forget
this mad infatuation.

55:08.687 --> 55:12.358
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home...

55:12.441 --> 55:17.948
But, Captain, we...
we don't know where Peter Pan lives!

55:18.031 --> 55:21.660
Great Scott,
you're right, Smee!

55:21.743 --> 55:23.121
What's that, my dear?

55:25.707 --> 55:29.795
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

55:29.879 --> 55:33.800
- Take this down, Smee.
- "Take this down, Smee".

55:33.885 --> 55:35.970
Aye, aye, Captain.

55:42.060 --> 55:45.315
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- "Start at Pegleg Point".

55:47.066 --> 55:50.362
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- "Blindman's Bluff".

55:50.446 --> 55:55.702
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and
a jump across Crocodile Creek.

55:55.785 --> 56:00.374
Then north by northeast,
one, two, three.

56:00.458 --> 56:04.463
Well, get on with it...
Continue, my dear.

56:07.383 --> 56:10.220
I mustn't harm Peter?

56:10.303 --> 56:14.350
Madam, Captain Hook
gives his word...

56:14.433 --> 56:17.228
not to lay a finger...

56:17.311 --> 56:20.065
or a hook on Peter Pan.

56:23.903 --> 56:26.906
Ah, Hangman's Tree.

56:26.989 --> 56:31.453
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

56:31.537 --> 56:35.375
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

56:42.007 --> 56:45.554
<i>Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

57:10.376 --> 57:13.547
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!

57:13.630 --> 57:15.173
- How.
- How.

57:15.257 --> 57:18.219
Big Chief greets Little Mother.

57:18.303 --> 57:20.763
- How!
- Ugh!

57:20.847 --> 57:24.101
Aw, Wendy, is that
all you have to say?

57:24.184 --> 57:27.731
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

57:27.814 --> 57:30.817
- Tiger Lily?
- John! Michael!

57:30.901 --> 57:33.237
Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

57:33.321 --> 57:36.073
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

57:36.157 --> 57:38.410
Go for days without sleep.

57:38.493 --> 57:40.621
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!

57:40.704 --> 57:44.500
- And...
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.

57:44.584 --> 57:49.173
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

57:49.256 --> 57:52.009
Now, Peter, let's stop
pretending and be practical.

57:52.092 --> 57:55.513
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

57:55.597 --> 57:58.851
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.

57:58.935 --> 58:02.689
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like... like savages?

58:02.773 --> 58:04.691
- Of course.
- But you can't.

58:04.775 --> 58:08.238
You need a mother.
We all do.

58:08.321 --> 58:10.490
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

58:10.573 --> 58:12.660
Why, Michael, of course not!

58:12.743 --> 58:14.912
Surely you haven't forgotten
our real mother!

58:14.995 --> 58:20.585
Did she have silky ears
and wear a fur coat?

58:20.669 --> 58:24.423
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.

58:24.507 --> 58:26.425
I think I had a mother once.

58:26.509 --> 58:30.431
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.

58:30.515 --> 58:33.477
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

58:33.561 --> 58:36.105
Hey, who ya shovin'?

58:37.648 --> 58:42.028
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

58:42.112 --> 58:44.657
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

58:44.907 --> 58:48.036
Well, a mother,

59:57.453 --> 01:00:06.798
<i>Might as well ask

01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:12.888
<i>Ask your heart
to tell you her worth</i>

01:00:12.973 --> 01:00:16.226

- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.

01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:50.934
I propose we leave
for home at once.

01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:53.980
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!

01:00:54.063 --> 01:00:58.277
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.322
Uh, that is,
if Peter doesn't mind.

01:01:01.405 --> 01:01:04.284
Go on!
Go back and grow up!

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:07.579
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up...

01:01:07.662 --> 01:01:09.832
you can never come back!

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.253
- Never!
- Dear.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:17.090
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.260
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

01:01:20.845 --> 01:01:22.764
They'll be back.

01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:29.774
Peter.

01:01:33.027 --> 01:01:35.614
Goodbye, Peter.

01:01:43.374 --> 01:01:45.292
All right, men.
Take them away.

01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:52.968
And now, Smee, to take care
of Master Peter Pan.

01:01:53.051 --> 01:01:58.850
But, Captain, wouldn't it
be more humane-like to slit his throat?

01:01:58.934 --> 01:02:01.645
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

01:02:01.728 --> 01:02:05.483
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

01:02:05.566 --> 01:02:08.988
or a hook on Peter Pan.

01:02:10.239 --> 01:02:15.078
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

01:02:15.328 --> 01:02:19.083
<i>Yo ho, yo ho

<i>A special offer for today</i>

01:02:57.254 --> 01:02:59.174
<i>The choice is up to you</i>

01:02:59.257 --> 01:03:01.468
<i>The choice is up to you</i>

01:03:01.551 --> 01:03:05.348
<i>Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho</i>

01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:07.350
<i>You'll love the life of a thief</i>

01:03:07.433 --> 01:03:09.561
<i>You'll relish the life
of a crook</i>

01:03:09.645 --> 01:03:11.480
<i>There's barrels
of fun for everyone</i>

01:03:11.563 --> 01:03:15.193
<i>And you'll get treasures
by the ton</i>

01:03:15.276 --> 01:03:19.406
<i>So come and sign the book</i>

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:22.451
<i>Join up with Captain Hook</i>

01:03:22.534 --> 01:03:24.746
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:28.124
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:33.172
Boys! Aren't you
ashamed of yourselves?

01:03:33.255 --> 01:03:36.426
But Captain Hook is
most insistent, Wendy.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:39.847
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:43.435
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:47.272
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.777
Peter Pan will save them.

01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:54.740
Oh, Captain, you did it.

01:03:54.824 --> 01:03:57.576
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.956
I don't believe you are
in on our little joke.

01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:05.295
You see, we left
a present for Peter.

01:04:05.378 --> 01:04:08.214
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

01:04:08.298 --> 01:04:11.760
Why, I can see our little
friend at this very moment...

01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:16.099
reading the tender inscription.

01:04:16.182 --> 01:04:20.814
"To Peter, with love
from Wendy.

01:04:20.897 --> 01:04:24.485
Do not open till 6 o'clock".

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.613
Huh. I wonder what's in it.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.826
Could he but see
within the package...

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:35.290
he would find an ingenious
little device.

01:04:35.373 --> 01:04:38.293
Set, so that when
the clock is like this...

01:04:38.376 --> 01:04:41.631
Peter Pan will be blasted...

01:04:41.714 --> 01:04:45.510
out of Never Land forever.

01:04:45.594 --> 01:04:46.345
No!

01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:53.436
But time grows short.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:58.067
We have but 18 seconds.

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:01.446
Fifteen seconds.

01:05:01.529 --> 01:05:04.325
Thirteen seconds.

01:05:04.408 --> 01:05:06.327
Twelve seconds.

01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.371
Well, I guess
I can open it now.

01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:17.423
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.

01:05:17.507 --> 01:05:20.928
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

01:05:21.011 --> 01:05:23.180
Hook? A bomb?

01:05:23.263 --> 01:05:25.433
Don't be ridiculous!

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:37.948
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:39.951
Amen.

01:05:43.872 --> 01:05:46.793
Hook! It was a bomb!

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:51.298
Why, if it hadn't been
for Tink... Tinker Bell!

01:05:55.721 --> 01:05:58.640
Tink? Tinker Bell?

01:06:01.561 --> 01:06:03.563
Where are you, Tink?

01:06:03.646 --> 01:06:06.984
Tink? Tinker Bell!

01:06:14.035 --> 01:06:17.330
Tink. Are you all right?

01:06:17.413 --> 01:06:21.293
Wendy? The boys?

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:26.090
But I've gotta save you first.

01:06:26.174 --> 01:06:28.301
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:31.638
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:35.310
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world!

01:06:37.896 --> 01:06:43.027
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:46.740
Captain Hook, we will
never join your crew.

01:06:46.823 --> 01:06:50.161
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.

01:06:50.244 --> 01:06:53.665
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:57.711
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

01:06:57.795 --> 01:07:01.341
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!

01:07:01.424 --> 01:07:04.095
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going! Don't give us no trouble!

01:07:04.178 --> 01:07:07.014
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!

01:07:07.098 --> 01:07:10.018
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!

01:07:17.528 --> 01:07:20.281
Wendy! Wendy!

01:07:24.704 --> 01:07:28.874
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:32.212
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

01:07:32.295 --> 01:07:35.049
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

01:07:35.133 --> 01:07:38.971
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:41.557
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.934
The ship is bewitched.

01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:46.104
No splash, Captain.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:51.318
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:53.696
I'll give you a splash!

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:56.324
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

01:07:56.533 --> 01:08:00.330
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:02.415
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

01:08:02.498 --> 01:08:04.710
It's his blinkin' ghost
what's talkin'!

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.628
Say your prayers, Hook.

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:11.134
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:14.180
I'll run him through! Ooh!

01:08:14.263 --> 01:08:16.265
Take that!

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:24.817
Curse this hook!

01:08:26.611 --> 01:08:28.613
Come on, everybody!

01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:34.953
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

01:08:35.037 --> 01:08:37.999
Don't stand there,
you bilge rats!

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:41.170
Get those scurvy brats!

01:08:41.252 --> 01:08:44.133
After the brats, men!

01:09:09.413 --> 01:09:11.457
This is no mere boy.

01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:15.170
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

01:09:23.054 --> 01:09:25.140
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

01:09:25.224 --> 01:09:28.394
Steady, men. Steady.

01:09:28.477 --> 01:09:30.479
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:34.151
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:36.863
Down, you blackguard!

01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:14.785
Hurray!

01:10:19.707 --> 01:10:24.546
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:27.800
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

01:10:27.883 --> 01:10:29.594
Coward? Me?

01:10:29.761 --> 01:10:34.892
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

01:10:34.975 --> 01:10:37.520
You'd fly away like
a cowardly sparrow!

01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:40.690
Nobody calls Pan
a coward and lives!

01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:43.735
I'll fight you man-to-man,
with one hand behind my back.

01:10:45.279 --> 01:10:50.077
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.416
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

01:11:15.065 --> 01:11:20.363
Now! Insolent youth,
prepare to die!

01:11:20.447 --> 01:11:23.158
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

01:11:23.241 --> 01:11:27.329
No! I gave my word.

01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:33.045
You're mine, Hook!

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.968
Cleave him to the brisket!

01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:42.682
You wouldn't do old Hook
in now, would you, lad?

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:47.271
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

01:11:47.354 --> 01:11:53.028
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.

01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:56.491
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

01:11:56.574 --> 01:12:00.996
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.418
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish

01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:09.757
- Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
- All right, Hook...

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.053
you're free to go,
and never return.

01:12:17.557 --> 01:12:19.559
Peter!

01:12:27.861 --> 01:12:30.407
Smee! Smee!

01:12:44.172 --> 01:12:46.092
Smee!

01:12:47.844 --> 01:12:52.933
Smee! Smee!

01:12:53.016 --> 01:12:57.105
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

01:12:57.188 --> 01:12:59.775
Captain!

01:12:59.859 --> 01:13:01.944
Captain! Captain!

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:04.949
Hurray!

01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:09.537
Hurray for Captain Pan!

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.875
All right, ya swabs,
aloft with ya!

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:17.005
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:21.051
But, but, Peter...
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:26.224
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?

01:13:26.308 --> 01:13:30.229
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.

01:13:30.313 --> 01:13:34.233
Michael! John!
We're going home!

01:13:34.317 --> 01:13:37.071
Man the capstan!

01:13:37.154 --> 01:13:39.908
Hoist anchor!

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.704
Pixie dust!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.421
George, I am so glad
you changed your mind

01:14:25.422 --> 01:14:27.923
about Wendy. After all,
she's still a child.

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:32.221
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.

01:14:32.304 --> 01:14:34.265
Do I, Nana?

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:40.106
Oh! Wendy!

01:14:42.483 --> 01:14:45.737
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:48.282
Mmm. Hmm?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.288
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?

01:14:53.371 --> 01:14:56.250
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.794
- Lost Bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

01:14:58.878 --> 01:15:01.214
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:04.384
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:08.097
- Uh, "am"?
- Uh, ready to grow up.

01:15:08.181 --> 01:15:10.434
Oh! Oh! Uh...

01:15:10.517 --> 01:15:14.104
Well, my dear,
all in good time.

01:15:14.188 --> 01:15:16.941
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- Oh, but, Mother...

01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:19.611
it was such a wonderful adventure.

01:15:19.694 --> 01:15:22.448
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

01:15:22.531 --> 01:15:24.450
Oh, he was the most
wonderful of all.

01:15:24.533 --> 01:15:27.621
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I...
- Kidnapped!

01:15:27.704 --> 01:15:31.375
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan
would save us, and he did.

01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:34.295
And we all called him a codfish!

01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:36.465
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.

01:15:36.548 --> 01:15:40.386
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:44.974
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.

01:15:45.058 --> 01:15:49.980
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

01:15:50.064 --> 01:15:53.235
See how well he sails the ship.

01:15:53.318 --> 01:15:57.990
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?

01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:03.039
Nana, d-did you see...

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:07.837
You know, I have
the strangest feeling...

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.340
that I've seen that ship before.

01:16:10.423 --> 01:16:12.759
A long time ago...

01:16:12.843 --> 01:16:15.388
when I was very young.

01:16:15.471 --> 01:16:19.767
- George, dear.
- Father.

01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:23.105
<i>When there's a smile in your heart</i>

01:16:23.188 --> 01:16:28.445
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

01:16:28.528 --> 01:16:30.614
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

01:16:30.698 --> 01:16:32.616
<i>When you leave the world behind</i>

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:36.204
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

01:16:36.288 --> 01:16:38.957
<i>You can fly</i>

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.461
<i>You can fly</i>

01:16:42.712 --> 01:16:47.468
<i>You can fly</i>
