00:16.850 --> 00:18.370
How does it look, Azalea?

00:18.910 --> 00:20.660
No change in its standby location.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.390
No other signs of enemies.

00:22.870 --> 00:26.030
Okay, let's get started!

00:31.410 --> 00:32.470
All right!

00:39.170 --> 00:40.040
Let's go.

00:44.730 --> 00:46.230
You know the plan, right?

00:46.230 --> 00:47.110
Right!

00:47.380 --> 00:49.170
Stay sharp, Naotsugu.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.690
Leave it to me.

00:58.470 --> 01:00.960
Naotsugu, you're within twenty meters.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.750
Roger.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.160
<i>Castle of Stone!</i>

01:08.970 --> 01:10.500
Okay, now!

01:10.820 --> 01:11.730
Let's go.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.260
Keep those shields up!

01:18.570 --> 01:23.410
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

01:19.340 --> 01:21.280
<i>The skill Luseat just used,</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:24.990
<i>Hearken to the Mourning Bell of Moonlight, 
has a ninety second cool down.</i>

01:25.820 --> 01:28.480
<i>We'll be in position by then.</i>

01:28.760 --> 01:31.600
<i>Time to retry!</i>

03:03.290 --> 03:05.100
Yes, that's the way.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.450
Keep your eyes on me, Luseat.

03:07.450 --> 03:11.980
Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six...

03:08.450 --> 03:10.320
Rear line, get back!

03:11.020 --> 03:11.980
How is the damage?

03:11.980 --> 03:16.440
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...

03:12.380 --> 03:13.510
Mostly dodged.

03:13.510 --> 03:14.670
Put a barrier on Naotsugu.

03:15.340 --> 03:18.170
Sasameyuki will handle the count 
for the area of effects.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.420
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...

03:20.400 --> 03:22.260
Deal with individual attacks yourselves.

03:22.650 --> 03:23.930
When he's in Black Knight Mode,

03:23.930 --> 03:26.740
everyone except the nine attackers, 
remember not to touch him.

03:27.610 --> 03:29.220
<i>He's changed.</i>

03:29.710 --> 03:33.340
<i>He's talking with us more than he used to.</i>

03:34.270 --> 03:38.690
<i>It feels like, after that defeat, 
the members have grown closer.</i>

03:39.790 --> 03:42.570
<i>We aren't friends... We're comrades in arms.</i>

03:43.610 --> 03:46.370
<i>You can't be friends with someone you dislike...</i>

03:46.780 --> 03:50.410
<i>Lightning Straight!</i>

03:51.080 --> 03:54.920
<i>But you can't keep hating a comrade in arms.</i>

03:56.610 --> 04:02.430
<b>Retry</b>

03:59.800 --> 04:00.830

04:12.000 --> 04:14.040
Naotsugu, switch with Dinkuron.

04:14.040 --> 04:14.930
Roger.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.590
<i>But that's a minor flaw.</i>

04:20.540 --> 04:22.890
<i>We're all game freaks.</i>

04:22.890 --> 04:24.190
<i>We're all the same.</i>

<i>We're here because we choose to be.</i>

04:33.460 --> 04:36.510
<i>How many times have we died 
since coming to this world?</i>

04:36.790 --> 04:39.540
<i>And each time, we have that horrible dream.</i>

04:39.900 --> 04:41.220
<i>But...</i>

04:41.220 --> 04:45.970
<i>I've never seen the members of 
Silver Sword in that dream!</i>

04:46.250 --> 04:47.040
<i>Yeah,</i>

04:47.430 --> 04:48.970
<i>not even once.</i>

04:49.610 --> 04:51.610
<i>Companions I'm never ashamed of...</i>

04:52.510 --> 04:55.480
<i>Is this what having a place to belong means?</i>

04:55.840 --> 04:59.980
<i>It's embarrassing to say this at my age, but...</i>

05:00.400 --> 05:02.990
<i>I guess you could call them "friends."</i>

05:05.140 --> 05:05.990
Ragoumaru!

05:06.310 --> 05:07.490
Right!

05:08.510 --> 05:09.990
<i>I want to win...</i>

05:10.370 --> 05:12.660
<i>It's not because we want to beat the raid boss.</i>

05:12.660 --> 05:15.500
<i>Or because we want glory or treasure.</i>

05:15.860 --> 05:18.000
<i>We just want to win.</i>

05:19.230 --> 05:21.500
<i>What we've done wasn't a waste.</i>

05:22.050 --> 05:24.100
<i>All we want to do is prove that!</i>

05:25.640 --> 05:27.280
<i>Zantetsuken!</i>

05:32.010 --> 05:33.140
William!

05:33.140 --> 05:34.060
It's gone critical!

05:34.620 --> 05:35.570
Hurry!

05:35.570 --> 05:37.280
Shiroe's team will take the lead!

05:43.290 --> 05:46.070
Team one, trail the Shadow 
Vanguard and defeat them.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.120
Don't neglect a single one!

05:48.120 --> 05:49.050
Right!

05:50.170 --> 05:52.710
<i>So this is Shiroe's plan.</i>

05:53.950 --> 05:58.820
<i>Last time, Ibrahabra and Taltaulgar 
appeared after the gates opened.</i>

05:56.620 --> 05:58.350
<b>Ibrahabra of the Third Garden, Lv. 93 
Rank/ Raid</b>

05:59.400 --> 06:03.020
<i>In other words, while they're closed, they're immobile.</i>

06:03.700 --> 06:05.010
<i>As is Luseat.</i>

06:06.270 --> 06:11.930
If we enter the western corridor, 
we can fight Ibrahabra alone.

06:11.930 --> 06:12.940
Yeah.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.600
And we've confirmed that the 
dungeon's goal lies beyond him, too.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.600
Of course, it's possible that Luseat

06:19.600 --> 06:22.050
will destroy the gate and come after us.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.800
And it looks like it's possible

06:24.800 --> 06:27.320
that if we take too long, 
Taltaulgar could also come.

06:27.600 --> 06:33.020
Even if we defeat Ibrahabra, 
there may be another raid boss beyond.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.710
Th-There are things we aren't sure of, but...

06:36.710 --> 06:39.700
That doesn't change the fact that there's a chance.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.710
Yeah.

06:40.710 --> 06:44.710
It doesn't matter if it's fifteen 
percent or five percent!

06:45.470 --> 06:49.220
If we miss this chance, there may not be another.

06:49.550 --> 06:52.270
<i>Damn it, he's right.</i>

06:52.700 --> 06:55.560
<i>But that was always true.</i>

06:56.100 --> 07:00.230
<i>There is no perfectly safe, secure future.</i>

07:00.870 --> 07:04.610
<i>But after I came to this world, I forgot that.</i>

07:05.140 --> 07:07.350
<i>I believed that since it was a game,</i>

07:07.350 --> 07:09.990
<i>I could do anything, and 
everything would go my way.</i>

07:10.400 --> 07:12.010
<i>And I was crushed.</i>

07:14.260 --> 07:16.770
<i>Sometimes, things don't go the way you want.</i>

07:16.770 --> 07:19.520
<i>This world is undeniably real!</i>

07:19.870 --> 07:21.830
<i>I was forced to realize that.</i>

07:21.830 --> 07:26.220
<i>But I still underestimated it, 
under the delusion that it was a game.</i>

07:26.900 --> 07:28.840
You made another mess.

07:29.090 --> 07:31.310
Hey, move.

07:31.310 --> 07:32.390
What?!

07:32.390 --> 07:35.390
You're just in the way, with that big body of yours.

07:35.860 --> 07:39.610
You damn little Land girl—

07:43.190 --> 07:45.820
If you're going to do nothing but talk,

07:45.820 --> 07:47.860
just hurry up and kill me.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.520
And if you aren't going to kill me, move.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.270
I can't clean.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.370
O-Okay...

07:56.750 --> 07:59.570
<i>And I lost again.</i>

08:00.570 --> 08:02.860
<i>I lost to Silver Sword,</i>

08:03.230 --> 08:05.390
<i>and my guild disbanded.</i>

08:06.210 --> 08:08.280
<i>And I lost to the raid boss.</i>

08:09.330 --> 08:12.090
<i>And I lost to William, as a guild master.</i>

08:14.630 --> 08:18.640
<i>He lost so badly, but no one left him!</i>

08:18.990 --> 08:20.270
<i>Not a single person.</i>

08:29.230 --> 08:30.030
Yes.

08:30.030 --> 08:33.260
At the end of that corridor is this raid zone's goal.

08:38.890 --> 08:41.570
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

08:53.400 --> 08:55.500
Naotsugu, bring Ibrahabra

08:55.500 --> 08:57.650
from the side with the corridor 
to the southwest wall!

08:57.910 --> 08:58.810
Right!

08:59.120 --> 09:00.740
<i>Fortress Stance!</i>

09:01.180 --> 09:05.310
Time to test out my new shield and armor!

<i>Fortress Stance increases your defense,</i>

09:15.690 --> 09:18.130
<i>but lowers movement and accuracy.</i>

09:18.130 --> 09:20.580
Out of the way, tank!

09:23.800 --> 09:27.080
<i>I can't lose anymore!</i>

09:28.910 --> 09:30.590
<i>Another Keen Edge?</i>

09:31.120 --> 09:32.570
<i>That damn enchanter.</i>

09:33.920 --> 09:34.970
That's...

09:35.240 --> 09:36.590
An AoE attack!

09:36.590 --> 09:37.590
Get back!

09:41.650 --> 09:43.020
I won't let you!

09:48.680 --> 09:49.390
Huh?

09:49.390 --> 09:50.520
It isn't hot!

09:51.870 --> 09:53.230
<i>Covering...</i>

09:53.830 --> 09:57.530
<i>A skill that allows you to absorb damage

09:57.740 --> 10:01.030
<i>Nice going, Demikas.</i>

10:02.730 --> 10:04.790
So damn hot...

10:05.260 --> 10:09.670
<i>It's true that monks have better 
elemental resistance</i>

10:10.100 --> 10:12.020
<i>and higher HP.</i>

10:12.500 --> 10:18.800
<i>If we divide the damage, I can 
still fight on the front lines!</i>

10:19.150 --> 10:20.180
That's it!

10:20.180 --> 10:22.810
Head around to the left side, 
and whittle down his HP!

10:24.270 --> 10:25.700
We can keep going!

10:26.340 --> 10:28.650
Come after me, dude!

10:29.240 --> 10:31.620
Naotsugu, you're really getting into it!

10:31.620 --> 10:33.070
Leave this thing to me!

10:35.070 --> 10:36.310
Okay!

10:38.040 --> 10:39.990
Everyone, do your best!

10:40.280 --> 10:43.660

<i>Aurora Heal!</i>

10:46.890 --> 10:48.510
Nice timing.

10:48.510 --> 10:50.170
Wonderful healing work.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.460
Well done!

10:51.750 --> 10:53.100
Leave it to me.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.680
I'm feeling good now!

10:54.680 --> 10:57.470
Of course! I'm an angel!

10:57.670 --> 10:59.210
What are they talking about?

10:59.210 --> 11:01.320
They sure are carefree.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.180
Naotsugu, are you in love with me?

11:05.180 --> 11:06.430
Definitely not.

11:07.620 --> 11:08.940
You're no fun...

11:08.940 --> 11:12.600
Oh, right. I had something to tell you.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.160
What is it? I'm really busy now.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.140
Actually...

11:17.140 --> 11:21.560
I'm joining Log Horizon!

11:24.330 --> 11:25.740
Why?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.840
So I can play with you!

11:28.840 --> 11:31.920
I got Shiroe's permission, too.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.250
Thanks a lot, Shiro...

11:35.660 --> 11:37.260
Um, isn't that bad?

11:37.580 --> 11:39.160
Front line, retreat!

11:39.160 --> 11:41.130
Federico, stay there and keep up the debuffs.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.770
Everyone else, focus on defense and healing.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.770
Taltaulgar...

11:54.020 --> 11:58.030
<b>Luseat</b>

11:54.020 --> 11:58.030
<b>Taltaulgar</b>

11:54.020 --> 11:58.030
<b>Abyssal Shaft</b>

11:54.020 --> 11:58.030
<b>Ibrahabra</b>

12:01.400 --> 12:02.620
Taltaulgar...

12:02.620 --> 12:04.280
H-He's here!

12:04.280 --> 12:05.780
Don't panic!

12:06.110 --> 12:07.100
Dinkuron!

12:07.100 --> 12:08.770
I've been waiting for you.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.860
I let him take the tank role so I could fight you!

12:12.860 --> 12:15.290
Healers, are you all in formation?

12:15.290 --> 12:16.290
Roger.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.300
<i>Castle of Stone!</i>

12:26.890 --> 12:28.640
<i>Ibrahabra and Taltaulgar.</i>

12:29.610 --> 12:32.780
<i>We were prepared to fight both at once.</i>

12:35.470 --> 12:39.400
So what do you mean when you say we have 
a fifteen percent chance of winning?

12:40.080 --> 12:41.770
During the last battle,

12:41.770 --> 12:44.750
we were attacked by two 
raid bosses simultaneously.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.160
There's no way you can win that.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.410
That's right.

12:48.410 --> 12:50.640
So what if it were only one?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.490
We probably would have been fine.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.280
Which means...

12:55.430 --> 12:59.840
If we don't let the raid bosses' attack 
radii overlap, we can survive?

12:59.840 --> 13:00.670
Yes.

13:01.470 --> 13:06.250
The Great Cave has the minimum 
size required for this to work.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.800
It's pretty close, though.

13:09.070 --> 13:12.410
Naotsugu will draw Ibrahabra 
to the southwest wall.

13:12.790 --> 13:17.270
And Dinkuron will tie down Taltaulgar 
at the northeast corridor's entrance.

13:17.980 --> 13:21.130
The plan requires some very difficult positioning.

13:22.930 --> 13:28.010
We'll need to give both Naotsugu and 
Dinkuron two dedicated healers,

13:28.660 --> 13:32.260
and the other healers will need 
to switch between the two.

13:33.170 --> 13:37.520
If those two get too close, 
their attack radii will overlap,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.210
and if they're too far, the buffs 
and heals won't reach them.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.180
The rear-line fighters will need to watch

13:44.180 --> 13:46.740
enemy movements, and constantly 
adjust their positions.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.890
We'll be fighting on a tightrope, but...

13:50.590 --> 13:54.550
Sounds more like a thread than a rope.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.820
But we'll win, Shiroe!

14:00.320 --> 14:04.080
Federico, attack power debuff! 
Attack radius debuff!

14:04.080 --> 14:05.170
I know!

14:05.540 --> 14:07.660
Tetra, up your healing output!

14:07.930 --> 14:10.130
