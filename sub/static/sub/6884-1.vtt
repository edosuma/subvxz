05:47.789 --> 05:51.456
Darling, don't be difficult.
Let's take our sweet...

05:51.581 --> 05:54.831
lovely children on an outing.

06:06.289 --> 06:09.831
You can't do this.
I know my rights.

06:09.956 --> 06:12.539
I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

06:12.622 --> 06:17.122
This exhibit degrades everybody who
sees it and the creature himself.

06:17.247 --> 06:20.456
He is a freak!
How else will he live?

06:20.581 --> 06:23.789
Freaks are one thing.
This is entirely different.

06:23.914 --> 06:27.206
This is monstrous
and should not be allowed.

06:27.289 --> 06:30.914
These officers will see to it
you're on your way soon. Good day!

06:32.414 --> 06:35.789
Move along please.

06:38.539 --> 06:40.456
Hold it there, sir.

06:40.539 --> 06:42.539
Come this way.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.164
On the move again...

07:01.247 --> 07:02.664
my treasure.

07:40.956 --> 07:43.206
We'll be seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents...

07:43.289 --> 07:45.081
- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.

07:49.331 --> 07:53.664
Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.

07:54.956 --> 07:56.747
What a mess!

08:00.497 --> 08:03.122
Pull on the rope.

08:04.289 --> 08:06.081
Irons, please.

08:20.039 --> 08:21.414
Who is it?

08:22.872 --> 08:25.914
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

08:25.997 --> 08:29.914
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

08:33.121 --> 08:36.456
All right. I'll see you
in a moment. Thank you.

08:39.621 --> 08:41.496
Who's that?

08:41.621 --> 08:44.956
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.

08:45.081 --> 08:48.372
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

08:48.456 --> 08:50.622
Come on, Freddie!

08:52.122 --> 08:54.081
Nothing of any importance.

09:48.039 --> 09:50.456
Can you tell me
where Cleeves Street is?

09:50.539 --> 09:53.956
'Round back, to the left,
then to the right. Straight through.

09:54.039 --> 09:55.456
Thank you.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.622
Are you the proprietor?

11:15.747 --> 11:18.289
And who might you be, sir?

11:18.414 --> 11:21.372
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

11:24.206 --> 11:27.581
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're...

11:29.289 --> 11:30.831
closed.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.831
Now, I'd pay handsomely
for a private showing.

11:33.956 --> 11:35.831
Are you the proprietor?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.914
Handsomely?
Who sent you?

11:37.997 --> 11:40.622
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

11:44.122 --> 11:47.331
I'm the owner.

13:08.581 --> 13:09.997
Life...

13:13.289 --> 13:15.747
is full of surprises.

13:19.789 --> 13:22.956
Consider the fate...

13:23.039 --> 13:25.831
of this creature's poor mother...

13:27.581 --> 13:30.122
struck down...

13:30.206 --> 13:33.247
in the fourth month
of her maternal condition...

13:33.331 --> 13:36.706
by an elephant,
a wild elephant.

13:36.789 --> 13:38.747
Struck down...

13:40.039 --> 13:44.539
on an uncharted African isle.

13:45.706 --> 13:47.289
The result...

13:49.289 --> 13:51.331
is plain to see.

13:53.456 --> 13:55.831
Ladies and gentlemen...

13:57.081 --> 13:59.206
the terrible...

14:00.831 --> 14:03.956
Elephant Man!

14:18.289 --> 14:20.581
- Stand up.
- Stand up!

14:27.164 --> 14:28.581
Turn around.

14:28.664 --> 14:31.414
Turn around! Turn around!

15:13.456 --> 15:15.456
Yes...

15:15.539 --> 15:18.289
you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr...

15:18.414 --> 15:20.164
Bytes.

15:20.289 --> 15:22.664
He'll be there.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.206
Good.

15:26.622 --> 15:30.122
Here's my card,
and I'll send a cab.

15:30.247 --> 15:31.664
All right?

15:31.789 --> 15:34.247
We have a deal.

15:36.247 --> 15:39.081
We understand each other.

15:40.289 --> 15:43.622
More than money has changed hands.

15:43.747 --> 15:46.914
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

15:46.997 --> 15:49.289
Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

15:50.831 --> 15:52.247
Tomorrow.

16:28.956 --> 16:31.372
Cor! What a stink!

16:32.622 --> 16:35.122
I'm looking
for Mr. Frederick Treves...

16:35.206 --> 16:37.081
please, ma'am.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.331
Very well.
I'll-I'll send for him.

16:41.456 --> 16:45.581
Nurse...
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...

16:45.664 --> 16:48.247
- This...
- Yes. Thank you.

16:48.331 --> 16:50.331
Yes, I was expecting him.

16:51.622 --> 16:54.122
- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.789
- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.331
- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.

17:00.456 --> 17:01.914
My pleasure.

17:02.997 --> 17:04.414
Thank you.

17:05.580 --> 17:08.205
Will you come this way, please?

17:09.622 --> 17:12.955
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my
room, and I'm not to be disturbed.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.664
- All right?
- Of course, sir.

17:18.789 --> 17:21.747
Will you come with me, please?

17:23.747 --> 17:25.705
You heard what the doctor said!

17:31.164 --> 17:33.247
Go on.

18:12.164 --> 18:14.081
My name is Frederick Treves...

18:14.164 --> 18:17.331
and I'm a surgeon here
at the London Hospital.

18:17.456 --> 18:18.872
And...

18:20.914 --> 18:24.747
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

18:29.039 --> 18:32.372
I'd like very much
to examine you so that...

18:34.206 --> 18:37.081
Would that be all right?

18:38.206 --> 18:39.914
Please.

18:44.622 --> 18:46.747
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

18:47.747 --> 18:49.997
Would that be all right?

18:51.956 --> 18:55.081
Your owner tells me... I mean the man
who looks after you tells me...

18:55.164 --> 19:00.081
that you're English
and your name is John Merrick.

19:01.414 --> 19:04.247
John Merrick.
Is that right?

19:07.914 --> 19:12.122
I tell you what.
I think I'll ask you a question...

19:12.247 --> 19:15.664
and you shake your head
like this for "no."

19:18.497 --> 19:20.706
Have you always been
the way you are now?

19:22.539 --> 19:24.581
Are you in any pain?

19:27.581 --> 19:29.789
Are your parents still alive?

19:29.914 --> 19:32.247
Do you understand me?

19:32.331 --> 19:35.622
Your father and your mother,
are they dead?

19:37.372 --> 19:39.372
Freddie, what are you doing for...

19:39.456 --> 19:43.581
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...

19:45.706 --> 19:47.622
Freddie, what the hell
have you got in there?

19:47.747 --> 19:50.039
You'll know soon enough,
at the meeting of the Society.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.956
Until then, I beg of you
not a word to anyone, please.

19:53.081 --> 19:56.331
All right, if you insist. But you
must have quite a find in there.

19:56.456 --> 20:00.122
- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?

20:01.206 --> 20:04.747
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.

20:08.039 --> 20:09.456
All right.

20:13.456 --> 20:14.872
Thank you.

20:45.706 --> 20:47.289
It's all right.

20:59.789 --> 21:01.747
I think I'll examine you now.

21:03.122 --> 21:06.122
I'll leave the questions
till later.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.664
All right?

21:08.789 --> 21:11.872
Will you take
your hat off now, please?

21:13.289 --> 21:15.414
Don't be frightened.

21:15.497 --> 21:17.872
I simply want to look at you.

21:18.581 --> 21:22.456
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

21:33.456 --> 21:34.997
Thank you.

21:35.122 --> 21:36.622
Good afternoon.

21:37.706 --> 21:39.622
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

21:46.122 --> 21:48.456
Pull the curtains aside.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.122
He is English...

21:57.247 --> 22:00.372
he is 21 years of age...

22:00.456 --> 22:02.914
and his name is John Merrick.

22:04.414 --> 22:07.497
Gentlemen, in the course of
my profession I have come upon...

22:07.622 --> 22:11.789
many lamentable deformities of
the face due to injury or disease...

22:11.914 --> 22:13.372
as well as mutilations...

22:13.456 --> 22:16.831
and contortions of the body
depending upon like causes.

22:16.956 --> 22:19.122
But at no time have I met
with such...

22:19.206 --> 22:22.039
a perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man.

22:22.122 --> 22:26.247
I draw your attention to the
insidious conditions affecting him.

22:26.331 --> 22:28.664
- Can you see over there?
- Yes.

22:28.789 --> 22:31.956
Note, if you will, the
extreme enlargement of the skull...

22:32.081 --> 22:35.581
right upper limb,
which is totally useless...

22:35.664 --> 22:38.122
the alarming curvature
of the spine.

22:38.247 --> 22:41.414
- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.

22:44.581 --> 22:46.456
The looseness of the skin...

22:46.581 --> 22:52.039
and the varying fibrous tumors
that cover 90% of the body.

22:52.122 --> 22:54.581
And there is every indication that
these afflictions have been...

22:54.664 --> 22:59.122
in existence and have
progressed rapidly since birth.

22:59.206 --> 23:01.831
The patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis.

23:01.956 --> 23:03.914
As an interesting side note...

23:03.997 --> 23:05.997
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies...

23:06.122 --> 23:11.206
the patient's genitals remain
entirely intact and unaffected.

23:11.289 --> 23:12.914
Thank you.

23:15.831 --> 23:19.039
And his left arm is perfectly
normal, as you see.

23:21.414 --> 23:24.372
So then, gentlemen, owing
to this series of conditions...

23:24.456 --> 23:27.664
the congenital skull exostosis,
extensive papillomatous growth...

23:27.747 --> 23:30.164
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin...

23:30.289 --> 23:32.456
the great enlargement
of the right upper limb...

23:32.539 --> 23:35.622
involving all the bones, the massive
distortion of the head...

23:35.747 --> 23:40.122
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth...

23:40.247 --> 23:43.581
the patient has been called
the Elephant Man.

23:43.664 --> 23:45.081
Thank you.

24:13.122 --> 24:15.747
You never mentioned
his mental state.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.456
Oh, he's an imbecile,
probably from birth.

24:19.581 --> 24:21.456
The man's a complete idiot.

24:22.622 --> 24:24.581
I pray to God he's an idiot.

24:35.622 --> 24:37.539
Where have you been?

25:07.997 --> 25:09.414
Out.

25:11.372 --> 25:13.831
How can I eat
with a noise like that?

25:23.789 --> 25:25.372
Bytes, don't!

25:27.414 --> 25:30.664
Where have you been?
What did you do?

25:35.831 --> 25:38.664
- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

25:38.747 --> 25:40.956
Like this.

25:42.914 --> 25:46.039
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night.

25:48.122 --> 25:51.789
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him.

25:51.872 --> 25:53.581
Yes, I intend to.

25:55.372 --> 25:57.289
- What happened?
- He fell!

25:58.081 --> 25:59.872
He falls.

26:08.747 --> 26:10.664
Looks like he's had
a very severe fall.

26:12.164 --> 26:14.914
He's a clumsy soul.

26:15.997 --> 26:17.914
Never looks where he's going.

26:17.997 --> 26:22.247
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.

26:22.331 --> 26:25.081
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.

26:26.247 --> 26:28.372
Well, that's how he sleeps.

26:28.456 --> 26:32.331
If he lies down,
he'll kill himself.

26:32.456 --> 26:35.789
His head's too big.

26:35.914 --> 26:39.706
All right. This man
belongs in a hospital.

26:40.747 --> 26:42.622
Can't you treat him here?

26:42.747 --> 26:45.247
Listen, he's my livelihood.

26:45.331 --> 26:48.581
We're business partners,
he and I.

26:51.789 --> 26:53.789
He's the greatest freak
in the world.

26:53.872 --> 26:58.039
Yes, now you listen. You won't have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

26:58.122 --> 27:01.039
Now, stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.

27:01.122 --> 27:03.956
I truly, truly appreciate this,
my friend.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.664
Listen. There are a lot of things
I could do for you.

27:08.747 --> 27:13.622
You see, I move in the proper
circles for this type of thing.

27:14.706 --> 27:18.039
In fact, anything at all...

27:18.122 --> 27:20.206
if you take my meaning.

27:21.664 --> 27:23.581
Everything will be taken care of.

27:23.664 --> 27:25.581
It's good to do business with you.

27:48.622 --> 27:50.581
Here we go.

28:14.622 --> 28:16.789
All right.

29:11.247 --> 29:13.164
Can I have a bowl
of oatmeal, please?

29:13.289 --> 29:14.997
Yes, sir.

29:15.081 --> 29:17.914
Breakfasting with the patients
this morning, Mr. Treves?

29:17.997 --> 29:20.039
Yes. No, it's for a patient.

29:20.122 --> 29:22.164
There you are, sir.

29:23.414 --> 29:24.997
Thank you. Morning.

29:25.081 --> 29:26.414
Morning.

29:30.539 --> 29:33.456
Oh, Treves! Just come here
for a moment, will you?

29:43.706 --> 29:45.122
What's that?

29:45.956 --> 29:50.289
Good heavens! You haven't acquired
a sudden taste for this, have you?

29:50.372 --> 29:53.331
- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

29:53.456 --> 29:55.664
Not quite the diet
for a grown man.

29:55.747 --> 29:57.206
Nurse!

29:58.206 --> 30:00.081
When you have a moment...

30:00.206 --> 30:04.914
take this up to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

30:04.997 --> 30:06.706
Yes, sir.

30:08.372 --> 30:11.122
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

30:12.456 --> 30:14.622
Won't he indeed!
Just a minute, Treves.

30:14.747 --> 30:16.997
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.

30:19.914 --> 30:23.456
A hospital's no place for secrecy,
you know, Mr. Treves.

30:23.539 --> 30:27.706
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
about is apt to cause comment.

30:27.789 --> 30:29.997
Why wasn't this patient
properly admitted?

30:30.081 --> 30:33.664
Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?

30:33.747 --> 30:37.914
No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis
and he's been badly beaten.

30:38.039 --> 30:39.997
Why isn't he
in the general ward then?

30:40.914 --> 30:43.747
Well, sir, he's quite
seriously deformed...

30:43.831 --> 30:47.081
and I fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking.

30:47.164 --> 30:49.914
Deformed? Is that it?

30:49.997 --> 30:53.081
Am I to assume then
that he is ultimately incurable?

30:53.206 --> 30:54.081
Yes, sir.

30:54.206 --> 30:57.289
But you must be aware that this
hospital doesn't accept incurables.

30:57.372 --> 30:59.289
The rules are perfectly clear.

30:59.372 --> 31:01.289
Yes, sir,
I'm well aware of that...

31:01.372 --> 31:04.206
but this case
is quite exceptional.

31:25.081 --> 31:28.622
I quite appreciate your problem,
Mr. Treves.

31:28.706 --> 31:33.081
Why not contact the British Home or
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

31:33.164 --> 31:35.081
They might find a place for him.

31:35.164 --> 31:37.747
I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?

31:55.081 --> 31:57.039
Excuse me.

31:57.747 --> 31:59.247
The Elephant Man.

32:05.914 --> 32:07.372
Sorry.

32:14.247 --> 32:17.081
I should have warned you.

32:17.164 --> 32:19.081
Please forgive me.

32:19.914 --> 32:22.289
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

32:23.747 --> 32:26.664
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead
to come up here.

32:26.747 --> 32:30.164
Tell her to knock on the door
and wait for me.

32:41.414 --> 32:44.372
I'm sorry about that. I...

32:46.122 --> 32:49.664
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

32:49.747 --> 32:54.122
And I think you'll be quite
comfortable here for a while.

32:54.247 --> 32:56.247
I'll see to it that you have
everything you need.

36:18.247 --> 36:19.456
Cor blimey!

36:24.789 --> 36:28.581
So, this is the Elephant Man.

36:30.122 --> 36:32.622
I ain't seen nothing
like you before.

36:34.914 --> 36:37.539
What the bleedin' hell
happened to ya?

36:42.081 --> 36:43.747
Dumb, eh?

36:45.414 --> 36:48.247
I like people
that can keep quiet.

36:51.622 --> 36:54.414
Here, have a drink.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.414
Go on! No?

37:04.081 --> 37:06.581
You should be more sociable, mate.

37:08.747 --> 37:10.997
You'll get yourself disliked.

37:16.247 --> 37:19.581
You and I are
gonna be good friends...

37:19.706 --> 37:21.914
and I've got a lot of friends
who'd like to meet you.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.081
And they will, mate.

37:24.206 --> 37:27.081
Believe me, they will.

37:38.206 --> 37:41.539
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

37:41.622 --> 37:43.747
Come on, up on the bed.

38:20.581 --> 38:23.081
All he understands
is a good smack.

38:23.206 --> 38:26.789
He's had his share of smacks. That's
what drives him under the bed.

38:26.914 --> 38:29.581
You have to treat him
with kindness and patience.

38:29.706 --> 38:33.331
Perhaps you've got time for that
sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.

38:33.414 --> 38:36.372
But I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.

38:36.456 --> 38:38.622
Now, don't you waste your time
with him, sir.

38:40.081 --> 38:43.497
It's like talking to a brick wall.

38:43.581 --> 38:47.914
Now, I don't mean to be harsh but...

38:48.039 --> 38:49.997
he doesn't belong here.

38:51.914 --> 38:56.997
Honestly, sir, honestly,
what can you do for him?

39:09.372 --> 39:13.039
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said...

39:13.122 --> 39:16.081
he would like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

39:16.164 --> 39:17.831
- Yes.
- Right.

39:23.914 --> 39:26.164
I can't help you
unless you help me.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.831
You see, I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

39:38.914 --> 39:41.581
Something back there.

39:41.706 --> 39:44.206
I can't help you unless
you help me, you know!

39:47.497 --> 39:50.414
I believe you want to say something
to me, don't you?

39:52.081 --> 39:55.414
I've got to understand what you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

39:57.122 --> 39:59.206
Do you understand me?

40:02.372 --> 40:06.039
All right, just nod your head
if you can... Can you understand me?

40:06.122 --> 40:08.872
Just nod your head
if you understand me.

40:13.622 --> 40:15.164
All right.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.331
You do understand.

40:19.414 --> 40:21.914
I want to hear...
I want to hear you talk.

40:22.039 --> 40:24.831
We're gonna show them that
you're not a wall. Understand?

40:24.914 --> 40:27.664
I want you to talk to me.

40:27.747 --> 40:31.706
All right, now,
I want to hear you say it.

40:31.789 --> 40:34.289
I've got to hear how
you say things.

40:34.414 --> 40:38.789
I won't hurt you. I've got to hear
and understand how you say things.

40:38.914 --> 40:42.289
Very slowly,
I want you to say, "Yes."

40:44.414 --> 40:45.664
Say, "Yes."

40:50.997 --> 40:52.872
Yes.

40:53.956 --> 40:55.414
Yes!

40:55.539 --> 40:56.956
Good.

40:57.706 --> 41:01.081
All right, now, just once more
say it again. "Yes."

41:05.914 --> 41:08.539
Yes, I can understand that.

41:08.622 --> 41:10.081
That's good.

41:11.247 --> 41:13.247
That's very good.
All right now.

41:13.331 --> 41:16.289
I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

41:16.414 --> 41:18.581
Do you understand?

41:18.706 --> 41:21.081
Say, "Hello.

41:21.164 --> 41:22.914
My name is..."

41:27.539 --> 41:28.956
Hello.

41:30.247 --> 41:32.956
My name is...

41:33.081 --> 41:35.706
"John Merrick."

41:38.414 --> 41:41.622
No. John... That's very good.

41:41.747 --> 41:43.914
Say, "John Merrick."

41:48.414 --> 41:52.539
"Hello. My name is John Merrick."

41:54.706 --> 41:55.956
Hello.

41:56.081 --> 41:59.414
My name is...

41:59.497 --> 42:02.081
John Merrick.

42:02.206 --> 42:03.539
You can speak.

42:12.206 --> 42:14.206
How did you get up here?

42:15.706 --> 42:17.622
I want my man back.

42:17.747 --> 42:22.331
- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.

42:22.414 --> 42:24.331
He's still very sick.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.789
Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

42:26.914 --> 42:28.539
Don't!

42:29.914 --> 42:31.997
Don't.

42:32.081 --> 42:36.081
You've had plenty of time to...

42:36.206 --> 42:38.331
cure him.

42:38.414 --> 42:41.081
And now he's leaving with me.

42:41.206 --> 42:46.414
Do you understand me now,
Mr. Treves?

42:46.497 --> 42:48.206
We made a deal.

42:48.289 --> 42:50.081
You misunderstood.

42:50.164 --> 42:54.747
This man has suffered a severe fall,
if you take my meaning.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.622
He's my patient now.

42:56.747 --> 42:58.747
Pull the other one,
why don't you?

42:58.831 --> 43:00.747
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.

43:00.831 --> 43:03.289
But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

43:05.414 --> 43:07.372
Do you think
you're better than me?

43:07.456 --> 43:09.372
No, I never said that.

43:09.456 --> 43:13.039
You wanted the freak...

43:13.122 --> 43:16.581
to show to those doctor chums of
yours, to make a name for yourself.

43:16.664 --> 43:18.622
You, my friend.

43:20.206 --> 43:25.247
I gave you the freak on trust...

43:25.372 --> 43:28.414
in the name of science...

43:28.497 --> 43:30.456
and now I want him back!

43:30.581 --> 43:32.581
You do not own this man!
Now stop it!

43:33.497 --> 43:35.247
I want him back!

43:35.372 --> 43:37.414
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?

43:37.497 --> 43:39.831
A dog in the streets
would fare better with you!

43:39.914 --> 43:41.956
I shall go to the authorities.

43:42.081 --> 43:45.456
Go to the authorities then!
Go to them by all means.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.914
They'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

43:50.664 --> 43:52.706
Now...

43:52.789 --> 43:57.247
I think we really do understand
one another.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.747
All right.

44:16.706 --> 44:19.914
Singularly unattractive character,
I must say.

44:21.747 --> 44:25.789
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

44:25.914 --> 44:29.289
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

44:32.164 --> 44:34.247
Shall we say in a few days then?

44:34.372 --> 44:36.622
Shall we say 2:00
tomorrow afternoon?

44:40.247 --> 44:43.497
Yes. Well, whatever's
most convenient for you, sir.

44:43.581 --> 44:45.956
2:00 then, tomorrow.

44:46.081 --> 44:48.081
Thank you very much.

44:52.414 --> 44:53.831
2:00!

44:57.706 --> 45:00.081
Morning, Mr. Treves.
Early again, I see.

45:00.206 --> 45:01.456
Yes.

45:01.581 --> 45:04.539
With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman.

45:04.664 --> 45:08.331
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.

45:16.414 --> 45:19.414
He restoreth my soul.

45:19.539 --> 45:24.539
He leadeth me into paths of...
for His name's sake.

45:24.622 --> 45:27.997
Righteousness. Righteousness.

45:29.664 --> 45:34.247
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

45:34.331 --> 45:36.831
for His name's sake.

45:36.914 --> 45:39.956
Good. That's very good. Good.

45:40.081 --> 45:44.372
When your visitor comes today, say
it exactly the way you've said it.

45:44.456 --> 45:49.164
So when I introduce him to you,
say the words that you've learned.

45:49.247 --> 45:52.997
If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.

45:53.081 --> 45:55.581
I will introduce him to you
and say...

45:55.664 --> 45:58.039
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

45:58.122 --> 45:59.706
And you will say?

46:00.914 --> 46:05.497
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

46:05.581 --> 46:07.831
I'm very pleased to meet you.

46:09.122 --> 46:11.581
Good! Good.

46:11.706 --> 46:14.622
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

46:20.247 --> 46:22.872
It is only a physical problem.

46:24.539 --> 46:27.247
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of...

46:27.372 --> 46:30.664
the constrictive deformity
of the mouth, but he can talk.

46:30.747 --> 46:34.581
Talking's one thing, but is he able
to understand what's said to him?

46:34.664 --> 46:37.622
Yes. Oh, yes! Except...

46:37.747 --> 46:41.706
Except he's so anxious to make
a good impression on you...

46:41.789 --> 46:43.997
that he might seem a little nervous.

47:01.831 --> 47:03.289
Come in.

47:17.456 --> 47:18.664
John...

47:18.747 --> 47:21.831
may I introduce you
to Mr. Carr Gomm?

47:21.914 --> 47:24.956
Mr. Carr Gomm,
this is John Merrick.

47:26.039 --> 47:29.581
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

47:29.664 --> 47:31.622
I'm very pleased to meet you.

47:31.747 --> 47:33.831
I'm very pleased to meet you.

47:36.456 --> 47:38.372
How are you feeling today?

47:38.456 --> 47:41.122
I feel much better.

47:42.581 --> 47:44.706
Are you comfortable here?

47:47.372 --> 47:50.456
Everybody's been very kind.

47:51.414 --> 47:53.372
How is your bronchitis?

48:05.581 --> 48:08.081
Mr. Merrick likes the food here,
don't you?

48:12.706 --> 48:16.206
Much better than what
I'm used to.

48:16.289 --> 48:17.997
Oh, yes?

48:18.914 --> 48:20.997
Yes. And what was that?

48:23.914 --> 48:25.372
Potatoes.

48:27.122 --> 48:29.164
I understood
that you'd been flogged.

48:32.206 --> 48:35.914
I feel much better now.

48:35.997 --> 48:37.372
That's splendid.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.414
How do you find Mr. Treves?

48:40.539 --> 48:42.706
As a teacher, I mean.

48:48.247 --> 48:52.831
Everybody's been very kind.

48:55.456 --> 48:59.789
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

49:06.581 --> 49:10.581
Everybody's been very kind.

49:10.706 --> 49:12.581
Yes, of course, I understand.

49:12.706 --> 49:15.622
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.872
Good day to you.

49:27.581 --> 49:29.456
Very good, John.

49:29.581 --> 49:31.456
It was very good.

49:31.581 --> 49:33.456
I'll be back in a moment.

49:37.581 --> 49:40.414
The Lord is my shepherd...

49:41.456 --> 49:43.789
I shall not want.

49:44.872 --> 49:46.747
He maketh me lie down...

49:46.872 --> 49:51.372
It was a brave attempt, but the man
was mouthing words taught by you.

49:51.456 --> 49:55.081
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

49:55.164 --> 49:58.331
He restoreth my soul.

49:58.414 --> 50:00.164
He simply doesn't belong here.

50:00.247 --> 50:03.539
He'd be better off somewhere where
he can be constantly looked after.

50:03.622 --> 50:06.581
I'm sorry things have turned out
this way. Good day to you.

50:06.664 --> 50:08.081
Yea...

50:09.414 --> 50:12.914
though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

50:13.039 --> 50:14.831
I fear no evil...

50:14.914 --> 50:17.747
for Thou art with me.

50:17.831 --> 50:20.247
Thy rod and staff, they...

50:20.372 --> 50:21.831
Mr. Carr Gomm!

50:24.331 --> 50:26.622
Yes, what is it?

50:26.747 --> 50:28.456
It's that.

50:30.081 --> 50:33.039
I didn't teach him that part.

50:34.747 --> 50:37.747
Surely goodness and mercy...

50:37.872 --> 50:41.081
will follow me all the days
of my life...

50:41.206 --> 50:46.206
and I'll dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

50:50.247 --> 50:53.706
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

50:53.789 --> 50:55.747
It's very strange.

50:56.997 --> 50:59.414
Tell me, how did you know
the rest of it?

50:59.539 --> 51:01.831
The 23rd Psalm.

51:05.039 --> 51:09.706
I used to read the Bible every day.

51:11.456 --> 51:14.081
I know it very well...

51:14.164 --> 51:16.456
and the Book of Common Prayer.

51:17.997 --> 51:21.914
The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful.
It's my favorite.

51:24.747 --> 51:27.872
Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

51:27.956 --> 51:29.914
There's something important
I want to say to you.

51:31.247 --> 51:34.956
Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

51:42.997 --> 51:46.622
Well, why didn't you tell me
you could read?

51:48.914 --> 51:51.747
I was frightened.

51:52.872 --> 51:54.039
I see.

51:54.122 --> 51:59.122
I was afraid to talk.

52:02.164 --> 52:04.914
Please forgive me.

52:14.789 --> 52:18.206
Can you imagine the kind of life
he must have had?

52:18.289 --> 52:20.164
Yes, I think I can.

52:20.247 --> 52:22.164
I don't believe so.

52:22.247 --> 52:26.247
No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!

52:37.081 --> 52:38.956
"Terrible though
his appearance is...

52:39.081 --> 52:43.122
so terrible indeed that women
and nervous persons...

52:43.247 --> 52:46.581
fly in horror
from the sight of him...

52:46.706 --> 52:52.081
and that he is debarred from seeking
to earn his livelihood in any way...

52:52.206 --> 52:54.956
yet he is superior in intelligence.

52:55.081 --> 52:59.039
He can read and write,
he's quiet, gentle...

52:59.122 --> 53:02.956
not to say even refined
in his mind."

53:10.497 --> 53:13.747
I should very much like
to meet this gentleman.

53:40.414 --> 53:42.456
Have you seen this?

53:49.539 --> 53:50.914
Listen to this.

53:51.039 --> 53:53.039
Hey up! Hey up!

53:57.956 --> 53:59.581
Now listen.

53:59.706 --> 54:03.289
This is a letter
to the London Times...

54:03.414 --> 54:05.539
from the governor of the hospital.

54:06.747 --> 54:09.497
"There is now in a little room
off one of our attic wards...

54:09.581 --> 54:12.081
a man named John Merrick.

54:12.164 --> 54:14.289
So dreadful a sight
that he is unable...

54:14.414 --> 54:17.497
even to come out by daylight
to the garden.

54:17.581 --> 54:20.581
He is being called
the Elephant Man...

54:20.664 --> 54:23.164
on account of
his terrible deformity.

54:23.247 --> 54:28.164
His appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons...

54:28.247 --> 54:30.872
fly in terror
at the sight of him."

54:33.914 --> 54:36.414
And how do you get tickets
to see him?

54:36.539 --> 54:38.747
Your very own Sunny Jim.

54:38.831 --> 54:41.414
- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

54:41.539 --> 54:43.831
The time must be right.

54:45.414 --> 54:47.372
Right now he's in the attic.

54:47.456 --> 54:52.831
But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.

54:52.914 --> 54:56.372
Then, for the right price...

54:56.456 --> 55:01.539
you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

55:50.997 --> 55:52.914
Well, don't look so glum, girls.

55:52.997 --> 55:56.831
Enthusiastic volunteers
should be more cheerful, hmm?

55:57.747 --> 56:00.414
Put your collar straight, girl.

56:00.497 --> 56:02.914
And remember...

56:02.997 --> 56:05.956
that under no circumstances...

56:06.081 --> 56:07.497
whatsoever...

56:09.664 --> 56:12.122
are any mirrors to be brought
into this room.

56:12.247 --> 56:14.206
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

56:15.414 --> 56:17.247
Yes.

56:17.331 --> 56:18.747
All right.

56:24.081 --> 56:28.872
- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.

56:34.872 --> 56:37.664
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

56:37.747 --> 56:39.206
Yes.

56:40.081 --> 56:43.081
You look very nice
in your new clothes.

56:44.747 --> 56:46.831
Thank you very much.

56:46.914 --> 56:49.581
If there's nothing else,
I suppose we'll be leaving you now.

56:49.664 --> 56:51.581
No, there's nothing.

57:22.456 --> 57:24.414
You ready for tea?

57:26.206 --> 57:28.206
Please go in, John.

57:35.622 --> 57:37.206
Make yourself comfortable.

57:49.664 --> 57:51.706
Come along, meet our guest.

58:01.122 --> 58:03.872
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Anne.

58:03.956 --> 58:06.956
Anne, this is John Merrick.

58:10.914 --> 58:13.039
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.

58:17.414 --> 58:19.414
I'm...

58:19.497 --> 58:22.706
I'm very pleased...

58:28.872 --> 58:31.289
What is it?
What's the matter?

58:33.289 --> 58:35.872
It's just that I...

58:36.997 --> 58:40.997
I'm not used to being...

58:41.081 --> 58:45.539
treated so well by...

58:45.622 --> 58:47.706
a beautiful woman.

58:50.081 --> 58:53.081
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?

58:54.122 --> 58:56.081
That's a good idea.

58:57.706 --> 59:02.081
Would you like to come and see the
rest of the house? I'll show you.

59:13.622 --> 59:15.581
How's your tea?

59:19.289 --> 59:20.914
It's very good!

59:24.247 --> 59:28.456
I'm enjoying my visit here
very much.

59:28.581 --> 59:33.039
It's so kind of you to invite me
into your own home.

59:36.206 --> 59:39.664
I'm sorry that I...

59:39.747 --> 59:42.414
made a spectacle of myself.

59:42.539 --> 59:44.664
No, not at all.

59:49.497 --> 59:52.747
I like the way...

59:52.872 --> 59:55.372
you arranged your pictures
on the mantelpiece.

59:55.456 --> 59:56.914
Oh, thank you.

59:56.997 --> 01:00:00.664
Is that the way they do it
in most houses?

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:03.747
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:05.747
Who are they of?

01:00:06.706 --> 01:00:11.081
These are relatives,
and these are our children.

01:00:11.164 --> 01:00:13.622
Children?
Oh, may I see?

01:00:13.747 --> 01:00:15.331
Yes, of course.

01:00:22.997 --> 01:00:25.414
Where are the children?

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.664
Well, um, well,
they're out with friends...

01:00:29.747 --> 01:00:31.372
at the moment.

01:00:31.456 --> 01:00:34.081
Friends.

01:00:34.206 --> 01:00:37.414
And here is Frederick's mother.

01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:42.164
Oh, how lovely.

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:46.206
And these are my parents.

01:00:52.122 --> 01:00:54.706
They have such...

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:57.747
noble faces.

01:00:57.872 --> 01:01:00.997
Yes, I've always...
I've always thought so myself.

01:01:02.664 --> 01:01:04.081
Would you...

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:08.997
Would you care to see my mother?

01:01:10.372 --> 01:01:11.789
Your mother?

01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:15.206
Yes, please.

01:01:23.456 --> 01:01:25.039
Oh, she's...

01:01:26.747 --> 01:01:28.747
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.

01:01:28.872 --> 01:01:31.122
Oh, she had...

01:01:31.247 --> 01:01:33.997
She had the face of an angel.

01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:45.164
I must've...

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:52.539
been a great disappointment to her.

01:01:52.622 --> 01:01:54.206
No, Mr. Merrick.

01:01:55.872 --> 01:01:58.581
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

01:02:00.914 --> 01:02:04.456
If only I could find her...

01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:06.956
so she could see me...

01:02:07.081 --> 01:02:11.372
with such lovely friends here now.

01:02:11.456 --> 01:02:13.456
Perhaps she could...

01:02:13.581 --> 01:02:15.456
love me as I am.

01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:20.164
I've tried so hard to be good.

01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:29.706
I'm so sorry.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:32.747
Please.

01:02:32.831 --> 01:02:34.831
I'm so sorry.

01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:38.122
Please. Here.

01:03:16.872 --> 01:03:18.789
What's that you're doing?

01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:23.622
What is it?

01:03:26.747 --> 01:03:29.789
I see.
It's St. Phillips.

01:03:29.914 --> 01:03:32.081
Why, that's very good.

01:03:32.206 --> 01:03:34.914
I mean, you got the windows
and arches just right.

01:03:49.914 --> 01:03:51.497
I wish...

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.581
I could sleep...

01:03:57.164 --> 01:03:58.914
like normal people.

01:04:06.456 --> 01:04:10.039
- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?

01:04:10.122 --> 01:04:12.622
There's something that...

01:04:12.706 --> 01:04:14.789
I've been meaning to ask you...

01:04:14.914 --> 01:04:16.956
for some time now.

01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:18.414
What's that?

01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:21.539
Can you cure me?

01:04:25.872 --> 01:04:28.206
No, we can care for you...

01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:31.331
but we can't cure you.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.497
I thought not.

01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:50.247
Come in.

01:04:51.997 --> 01:04:55.956
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:59.164
There's someone here who'd like
to meet you, if that's all right.

01:04:59.247 --> 01:05:01.789
May I introduce you
to one of the bright lights...

01:05:01.914 --> 01:05:04.081
of the English stage,
Mrs. Kendal.

01:05:04.206 --> 01:05:07.956
- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.

01:05:10.164 --> 01:05:11.747
Good day.

01:05:11.831 --> 01:05:14.414
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:16.414
I hope you don't
think it too forward.

01:05:21.331 --> 01:05:23.831
I knew you'd understand.

01:05:23.956 --> 01:05:25.872
I'll leave you together.

01:05:27.831 --> 01:05:29.414
Here.

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:36.039
I want you to know, I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

01:05:36.122 --> 01:05:38.081
Oh, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:42.206
It's beautiful.

01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:44.622
You're so...

01:05:44.747 --> 01:05:47.414
I'll... Well, I'll...

01:05:49.706 --> 01:05:53.539
I shall put it in a...
in a place of honor.

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:58.414
Here, next to my mother.

01:06:04.372 --> 01:06:06.497
She's very pretty, your mother.

01:06:06.622 --> 01:06:08.164
Oh, yes.

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:25.456
I see you're constructing a...

01:06:25.539 --> 01:06:27.164
church?

01:06:28.622 --> 01:06:32.289
Oh, no.
It's a cathedral.

01:06:32.414 --> 01:06:34.706
You see?

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:38.622
Only, I have to rely...

01:06:38.747 --> 01:06:40.289
on my imagination...

01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:43.122
for what I can't actually see.

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:59.872
Mr. Treves tells me
that you're in the theater.

01:06:59.956 --> 01:07:02.039
Do you live there?

01:07:02.122 --> 01:07:04.914
Oh, no, Mr. Merrick.
I just work there.

01:07:06.247 --> 01:07:08.622
Well, it must be...

01:07:08.747 --> 01:07:11.581
wonderful just to work there.

01:07:11.664 --> 01:07:14.831
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

01:07:14.956 --> 01:07:17.539
I'm afraid not.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:20.206
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You must go.

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:22.497
The theater's the most
beautiful place on earth.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.581
Of course, I am a bit partial.

01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:29.956
The theater is romance.

01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:32.914
Romance.

01:07:37.956 --> 01:07:40.414
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.

01:07:47.372 --> 01:07:49.289
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:55.289
No, but I certainly shall.

01:08:03.331 --> 01:08:06.247
Romeo and Juliet.

01:08:06.331 --> 01:08:08.664
Yes, I've heard of this.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:17.206
"If I profane
with my unworthiest hand...

01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:19.706
this holy shrine...

01:08:19.788 --> 01:08:23.163
the gentle fine is this...

01:08:23.247 --> 01:08:25.913
My lips...

01:08:25.997 --> 01:08:28.581
two blushing pilgrims...

01:08:28.663 --> 01:08:32.538
ready stand to smooth
that rough touch...

01:08:35.831 --> 01:08:37.747
with a tender kiss."

01:08:38.956 --> 01:08:42.872
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:45.247
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:49.497
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:51.913
and palm to palm
is holy Palmer's kiss."

01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:56.956
"O, then dear saint...

01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:59.997
let lips do what hands do.

01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:02.831
They pray, grant thou...

01:09:02.956 --> 01:09:07.081
lest faith turn to despair."

01:09:07.206 --> 01:09:09.122
"Saints do not move...

01:09:10.622 --> 01:09:12.581
though grant for prayer's sake."

01:09:13.788 --> 01:09:16.581
"Then move not...

01:09:16.663 --> 01:09:20.288
while my prayer's effect I take.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:23.497
Thus from my lips...

01:09:23.622 --> 01:09:27.247
by thine, my sin is purged."

01:09:31.831 --> 01:09:34.413
Oh, yes.
And then it says they kiss.

01:09:37.788 --> 01:09:40.747
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

01:09:47.038 --> 01:09:50.081
"Sin from thy lips?

01:09:50.163 --> 01:09:52.913
O trespass sweetly urged.

01:09:54.539 --> 01:09:57.247
Give me my sin again."

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:05.331
Oh, Mr. Merrick.

01:10:05.414 --> 01:10:07.539
You're not an elephant man at all.

01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:16.247
You're Romeo.

01:10:23.997 --> 01:10:27.456
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the
forefront of fashion and form...

01:10:27.581 --> 01:10:30.206
was seen leaving the London
the other afternoon.

01:10:30.289 --> 01:10:32.914
No, dear readers, the most
facile actress of our day...

01:10:32.997 --> 01:10:37.247
has not been taken ill, but rather
said she was visiting a friend.

01:10:37.331 --> 01:10:40.497
And who was the lucky recipient
of this attention?

01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:43.706
Quick inquiries proved it to be
none other than Mr. John Merrick...

01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:48.456
the Elephant Man, with whom our
readers are undoubtedly familiar.

01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:50.872
After a chat of
three quarters of an hour...

01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:53.164
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough
to leave Mr. Merrick...

01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:55.372
with an autographed portrait
of herself."

01:10:55.456 --> 01:10:57.372
I saw it in his room.

01:10:57.456 --> 01:11:01.081
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature...

01:11:01.164 --> 01:11:05.289
Mr. Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society.

01:11:05.414 --> 01:11:07.497
But knowing that
wherever Mrs. Kendal goes...

01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:11.789
others inevitably follow,
the question arises...

01:11:11.914 --> 01:11:14.914
'Will London society
present itself to him?"'

01:11:14.997 --> 01:11:19.539
This walking stick is so...
is so dashing.

01:11:19.622 --> 01:11:23.039
Much more elegant than my old one.

01:11:25.206 --> 01:11:26.789
More tea?

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:37.581
You see, I don't go out
as often as I would like...

01:11:37.706 --> 01:11:39.914
because naturally...

01:11:39.997 --> 01:11:43.122
some people do find
my appearance disturbing.

01:11:43.247 --> 01:11:46.789
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.

01:11:46.872 --> 01:11:49.664
No, I'm fine.
Please...

01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:52.414
I mean, thank you.

01:11:52.497 --> 01:11:54.081
Thank you.

01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:57.039
You see...

01:11:58.331 --> 01:12:00.664
people are frightened...

01:12:00.789 --> 01:12:02.956
by what they don't understand.

01:12:04.622 --> 01:12:08.122
And it is hard to understand
even for me...

01:12:08.247 --> 01:12:10.706
because, well, my mother...

01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:14.664
she was so very beautiful.

01:12:24.997 --> 01:12:27.914
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he
should have any more visitors today.

01:12:27.997 --> 01:12:30.206
I have to lecture at the college,
so I'll be back this evening.

01:12:30.289 --> 01:12:31.414
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

01:12:31.497 --> 01:12:33.539
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

01:12:33.622 --> 01:12:36.747
- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...

01:12:36.872 --> 01:12:38.914
I don't quite understand...

01:12:38.997 --> 01:12:42.372
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there.

01:12:42.456 --> 01:12:45.247
Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:47.914
Yes, but sir, you saw
the expression on their faces.

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:50.122
They didn't hide their disgust.

01:12:50.247 --> 01:12:51.956
They don't care
anything about John.

01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:54.289
They only want
to impress their friends.

01:12:54.414 --> 01:12:56.289
I think you're being
rather harsh on them, don't you?

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:58.414
I beg your pardon, sir.

01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:00.456
You yourself hardly showed him
much loving kindness...

01:13:00.581 --> 01:13:02.497
when he first arrived, did you?

01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:06.414
I bathed him, I fed him and
I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

01:13:06.497 --> 01:13:09.039
And I see that
my nurses do the same.

01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:13.539
And if"loving kindness"
can be called care...

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:16.414
and practical concern...

01:13:16.539 --> 01:13:19.789
then I did show him loving kindness
and I am not ashamed to admit it.

01:13:19.914 --> 01:13:23.081
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now, please believe me.

01:13:23.164 --> 01:13:25.081
Now, of course
I appreciate your concern.

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:27.497
I appreciate everything that
you've done for Mr. Merrick.

01:13:27.581 --> 01:13:32.039
But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what is best for him.

01:13:32.122 --> 01:13:35.789
- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion...

01:13:35.914 --> 01:13:38.289
he's only being stared at
all over again.

01:13:39.497 --> 01:13:41.081
Thank you.

01:14:07.539 --> 01:14:09.456
Night time.

01:16:59.956 --> 01:17:01.914
What's the matter, Freddie?

01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:07.914
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.

01:17:07.997 --> 01:17:09.664
What on earth
made you think of him?

01:17:09.747 --> 01:17:14.747
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

01:17:14.872 --> 01:17:16.456
That's absurd.

01:17:19.247 --> 01:17:22.372
It seems that
I've made Mr. Merrick...

01:17:22.456 --> 01:17:26.414
into a curiosity all over again,
doesn't it?

01:17:26.539 --> 01:17:29.747
Only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

01:17:31.789 --> 01:17:33.831
My name is constantly
in the papers...

01:17:33.914 --> 01:17:36.914
I'm always being praised
to the skies.

01:17:37.039 --> 01:17:40.956
Patients are now expressly
asking for my services.

01:17:41.081 --> 01:17:43.539
Of course they do,
because you're a very fine doctor.

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:46.747
John Merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now...

01:17:46.872 --> 01:17:48.372
than he's ever been
in his entire life...

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:50.622
and it's completely due to you.

01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:56.164
What was it all for?
Why did I do it?

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:58.164
Freddie, what are you trying to say?

01:18:03.289 --> 01:18:05.247
Am I a good man...

01:18:06.372 --> 01:18:08.289
or am I a bad man?

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:17.789
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.

01:18:17.914 --> 01:18:19.831
Come sit down, won't you?

01:18:25.456 --> 01:18:28.789
Gentlemen, I know we usually
open these proceedings...

01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:30.789
by reading the minutes.

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:33.414
But on this occasion,
in the interests of urgency...

01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:35.206
I think we should first conclude...

01:18:35.289 --> 01:18:37.706
the matter
previously under discussion...

01:18:37.789 --> 01:18:40.122
the case of Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

01:18:40.247 --> 01:18:44.414
One moment, Mr. Chairman.
As far as I'm concerned...

01:18:44.539 --> 01:18:47.706
this creature has no business
being here at all.

01:18:48.914 --> 01:18:50.789
I, for one,
am sick and tired...

01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:53.831
of this competitive freak-hunting...

01:18:53.914 --> 01:18:56.581
by these overly ambitious
young doctors...

01:18:56.664 --> 01:18:58.872
trying to make names for themselves.

01:18:58.956 --> 01:19:02.706
To parade them about in front of the
pathological society is one thing...

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:04.872
but to waste this committee's
valuable time...

01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:09.289
with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature is another.

01:19:14.289 --> 01:19:17.164
You must be more careful.

01:19:17.247 --> 01:19:21.247
In the light of these facts,
our course is clear.

01:19:21.372 --> 01:19:24.706
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient.

01:19:24.789 --> 01:19:28.247
The question is, when will
those rooms be vacated for use...

01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:31.497
by better qualified,
more deserving cases?

01:19:31.581 --> 01:19:33.247
I move that this Elephant Man...

01:19:33.372 --> 01:19:35.831
be removed from
the premises immediately.

01:19:35.914 --> 01:19:39.622
We have a sacred duty
to cure the sick...

01:19:39.747 --> 01:19:41.331
not care for circus animals.

01:19:42.747 --> 01:19:46.081
That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

01:19:46.206 --> 01:19:49.747
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind
is quite unshakable in this matter?

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:52.914
Mr. Chairman,
do you not have ears?

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:55.539
I am unalterably opposed!

01:19:56.289 --> 01:19:58.289
My mind is made up on this!

01:20:00.164 --> 01:20:02.247
You shall not sway me.

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:06.164
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman,
at long last?

01:20:07.289 --> 01:20:08.747
Yes, Broadneck.

01:20:08.872 --> 01:20:10.789
I think the time has come.

01:20:11.872 --> 01:20:14.997
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...

01:20:15.081 --> 01:20:18.331
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:38.956
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

01:20:39.081 --> 01:20:41.081
On the contrary, ma'am.
Your presence here...

01:20:41.206 --> 01:20:43.872
is always greatly appreciated.

01:20:43.956 --> 01:20:46.997
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

01:20:51.081 --> 01:20:54.831
Her Royal Highness has shown
the greatest interest in his fate.

01:20:54.914 --> 01:20:57.289
Indeed I have, sir,
as has the queen.

01:21:00.747 --> 01:21:03.414
I have a brief communication
from Her Majesty...

01:21:03.539 --> 01:21:06.039
which she has requested
that I read to you.

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:11.956
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

01:21:19.581 --> 01:21:23.914
I would very much like to commend
you for the charitable face...

01:21:23.997 --> 01:21:26.872
you have shown Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

01:21:26.956 --> 01:21:29.581
It is laudable
that you have provided...

01:21:29.664 --> 01:21:31.997
one of England's
most unfortunate sons...

01:21:32.081 --> 01:21:36.706
with a safe and tranquil harbor,
a home.

01:21:36.789 --> 01:21:38.664
For this immeasurable kindness...

01:21:38.747 --> 01:21:41.081
as well as the many
other acts of mercy...

01:21:41.206 --> 01:21:43.081
on behalf of the poor...

01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:47.289
of which Mr. Carr Gomm
has kept me informed...

01:21:47.414 --> 01:21:50.247
I gratefully thank you.

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.997
Signed, Victoria."

01:21:57.081 --> 01:22:01.414
I'm sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

01:22:01.539 --> 01:22:05.164
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.

01:22:06.414 --> 01:22:09.039
Gentlemen, I wish to move
that Mr. John Merrick...

01:22:09.122 --> 01:22:11.539
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis...

01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:14.789
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum...

01:22:14.914 --> 01:22:17.622
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed.

01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:20.539
All those in favor?

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:35.206
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.

01:22:41.372 --> 01:22:43.747
Yes. Come in!

01:22:49.206 --> 01:22:50.789
Good afternoon.

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:55.206
Mr. Carr Gomm has something
he wants to say to you.

01:22:55.289 --> 01:22:57.747
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure...

01:22:57.831 --> 01:23:00.581
in being able
to welcome you officially...

01:23:00.664 --> 01:23:02.372
to the London Hospital.

01:23:02.456 --> 01:23:05.122
This morning, the governing
committee unanimously voted...

01:23:05.247 --> 01:23:09.372
that you should be provided with
these rooms on a permanent basis.

01:23:09.456 --> 01:23:11.664
This is your home now.

01:23:11.747 --> 01:23:14.039
I'm so very, very glad for you.

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.456
Welcome home, lad.

01:23:20.664 --> 01:23:22.247
This is...

01:23:24.289 --> 01:23:25.706
my home?

01:23:25.789 --> 01:23:26.914
Yes.

01:23:27.039 --> 01:23:31.956
Please, will you thank
the governing committee for me?

01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:33.956
I will do my utmost...

01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:36.997
to merit their kindness.

01:23:37.622 --> 01:23:39.706
This...

01:23:39.789 --> 01:23:41.956
is my home?

01:23:43.039 --> 01:23:44.997
Yes. This as well.

01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:53.664
Your dressing case.

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:04.414
Oh, thank you.

01:24:11.039 --> 01:24:12.914
Thanks, all my friends.

01:24:13.039 --> 01:24:15.247
Thank you.

01:24:15.331 --> 01:24:18.539
- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.

01:24:24.081 --> 01:24:25.997
Oh, my friends.

01:24:28.539 --> 01:24:31.039
Oh, thank you.

01:24:55.706 --> 01:24:58.122
- Who's next?
- I say.

01:24:59.539 --> 01:25:01.956
- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...

01:25:02.081 --> 01:25:05.414
But these young ladies
have never seen it.

01:25:08.706 --> 01:25:10.289
You're on, mate.

01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:16.164
Okay, that's it
for this performance.

01:25:16.247 --> 01:25:19.706
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.

01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:22.997
There's always tomorrow.
Don't worry.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:29.206
Room for one more?

01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:31.247
At the right price.

01:25:33.122 --> 01:25:34.622
There's room.

01:25:46.539 --> 01:25:49.039
All right, all right!
Keep the noise down!

01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:53.997
We don't want
to frighten him, do we?

01:26:28.456 --> 01:26:30.747
Hello. My name...

01:26:30.872 --> 01:26:35.081
is John Merrick...

01:26:35.164 --> 01:26:39.372
and I'm very, very pleased...

01:26:39.456 --> 01:26:41.914
to meet you.

01:26:46.039 --> 01:26:48.622
I think you are...

01:26:48.747 --> 01:26:51.747
very beautiful...

01:26:55.331 --> 01:26:57.914
Curtain time!

01:26:57.997 --> 01:27:01.539
You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.

01:27:02.664 --> 01:27:04.914
You look like
the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

01:27:06.914 --> 01:27:08.831
Here, my friends...

01:27:10.372 --> 01:27:12.081
is the Elephant Man!

01:27:15.206 --> 01:27:18.581
I told you he was horrible.

01:27:18.706 --> 01:27:20.289
Just horrible.

01:27:29.747 --> 01:27:32.831
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:36.497
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!

01:27:40.581 --> 01:27:42.164
There.

01:27:44.456 --> 01:27:47.581
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

01:27:47.706 --> 01:27:51.706
Come on. Give the ladies' man
a little kiss, eh?

01:27:53.039 --> 01:27:55.247
Come on.
Give him a kiss.

01:28:07.247 --> 01:28:09.956
Here, here, here!
That's enough romance.

01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:11.664
Time for beddy-byes.

01:29:02.039 --> 01:29:03.914
All right, all right.
Keep the noise down.

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:06.581
Now, keep it quiet.
Quiet! Hey!

01:29:06.664 --> 01:29:08.622
Keep it quiet.
Now, watch this.

01:29:53.247 --> 01:29:55.831
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!

01:29:55.914 --> 01:29:58.081
That's it.
The show's over.

01:29:58.206 --> 01:30:00.122
I'll see you back
at the Peacock.

01:30:03.039 --> 01:30:04.956
Get out of here.

01:30:31.997 --> 01:30:33.581
Here.

01:30:34.747 --> 01:30:36.331
Come on.

01:30:39.247 --> 01:30:42.164
There you are.
That's better, isn't it?

01:30:44.914 --> 01:30:47.539
I've done well tonight.

01:30:47.622 --> 01:30:50.622
Here. Buy yourself a sweet.

01:31:17.914 --> 01:31:19.331
My treasure.

01:32:38.414 --> 01:32:41.539
- I know what happened last night.
- What?

01:32:50.122 --> 01:32:52.247
Dear God.

01:32:52.331 --> 01:32:54.081
Boy!

01:33:11.331 --> 01:33:15.372
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:23.456
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

01:33:25.581 --> 01:33:28.456
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

01:33:29.872 --> 01:33:33.081
I know all about it.
You were seen.

01:33:33.206 --> 01:33:35.081
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you?

01:33:35.206 --> 01:33:38.039
You've taken him.
Where is he?

01:33:38.122 --> 01:33:41.081
Now, wait a minute.
I haven't taken him anywhere.

01:33:41.164 --> 01:33:44.706
I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.

01:33:44.789 --> 01:33:46.747
We never hurt him.

01:33:46.872 --> 01:33:48.747
You know, just having a laugh,
that's all.

01:33:48.872 --> 01:33:51.956
You bastard! He's gone!

01:33:52.081 --> 01:33:54.372
When I left him,
he was in bed safe and sound!

01:33:54.456 --> 01:33:57.747
You bastard!
You bastard!

01:33:57.831 --> 01:34:01.414
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!

01:34:01.539 --> 01:34:03.289
I ain't done nothing wrong.

01:34:03.414 --> 01:34:07.081
People pay money to see
your monster. I collect it.

01:34:07.206 --> 01:34:09.331
You're the monster!
You're the freak!

01:34:09.414 --> 01:34:11.497
Now, get out!
You're finished!

01:34:11.581 --> 01:34:15.081
You don't frighten me,
you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.

01:34:16.622 --> 01:34:19.789
I'm glad what I done,
and you can do nothing about it.

01:34:19.914 --> 01:34:22.122
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

01:34:27.914 --> 01:34:29.539
Done.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:48.206
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.

01:34:49.372 --> 01:34:53.164
You know, I felt as deeply
as you did about John.

01:34:53.247 --> 01:34:54.956
Well, now he's disappeared...

01:34:55.081 --> 01:34:57.247
very likely to the continent.

01:34:57.372 --> 01:34:59.581
There's no question
of your going after him.

01:34:59.664 --> 01:35:02.622
You're desperately needed here
by your patients.

01:35:02.747 --> 01:35:05.539
You did everything
in your power.

01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:07.622
Remember that, Treves.

01:35:07.747 --> 01:35:09.664
Everything in your power.

01:36:39.206 --> 01:36:40.789
Get the stool.

01:37:07.497 --> 01:37:09.039
Get up, you bastard.

01:37:34.872 --> 01:37:38.622
Look at all these
beautiful animals.

01:37:43.122 --> 01:37:45.581
What a lot you have.

01:37:57.581 --> 01:38:00.081
That sly bastard.

01:38:05.081 --> 01:38:08.331
He's doing this to spite me!

01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:20.706
You're doing this to spite me...

01:38:20.789 --> 01:38:22.747
and it's got to stop!

01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:25.247
Bytes, he's sick!

01:38:25.372 --> 01:38:27.289
Let him die!

01:38:29.414 --> 01:38:32.164
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

01:38:34.581 --> 01:38:36.247
bag of flesh!

01:38:36.331 --> 01:38:37.914
Wrong!

01:38:45.039 --> 01:38:46.956
As a matter of fact...

01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:56.206
- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...

01:38:56.289 --> 01:38:58.247
Bytes, stop, please!

01:39:44.122 --> 01:39:46.622
Bytes, please, don't!

01:40:52.997 --> 01:40:54.581
We've decided...

01:40:57.831 --> 01:40:59.747
we're gonna get you out of here.

01:40:59.831 --> 01:41:01.956
All right?

01:41:28.414 --> 01:41:30.331
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.414
Luck, my friend.

01:42:54.081 --> 01:42:57.331
Luck. And who needs it
more than we?

01:44:24.956 --> 01:44:27.039
Hey, mister.

01:44:28.372 --> 01:44:31.456
Mister, why is your head so big?

01:44:35.581 --> 01:44:37.539
Why is your head so big, mister?

01:44:40.831 --> 01:44:43.872
Why is your head so big?
Why won't you answer me?

01:44:50.247 --> 01:44:52.164
Why is your head so big, mister?

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:22.372
Stop him!

01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:22.581
I am not an animal!

01:46:24.456 --> 01:46:27.372
I am not an animal!

01:46:30.081 --> 01:46:33.706
I am a human being!

01:46:39.081 --> 01:46:41.872
I am...

01:46:41.956 --> 01:46:43.914
a man!

01:46:48.956 --> 01:46:50.914
Excuse me, sir.

01:46:50.997 --> 01:46:53.456
Out of the way, sir.
Excuse me.

01:46:56.456 --> 01:46:59.747
Mr. Treves, sir!
They found him!

01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:02.372
I think they found John!

01:47:13.872 --> 01:47:15.456
Thank you.

01:47:22.747 --> 01:47:25.456
- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.

01:47:26.997 --> 01:47:30.581
That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

01:47:30.706 --> 01:47:32.289
It's so beautiful.

01:47:35.747 --> 01:47:38.539
Does Mrs. Kendal know
that John is dying?

01:47:42.914 --> 01:47:44.372
Yes, she knows.

01:47:59.456 --> 01:48:01.914
How do I look?

01:48:01.997 --> 01:48:03.581
Splendid.

01:48:03.706 --> 01:48:07.747
Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

01:48:07.872 --> 01:48:11.747
- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.

01:48:12.789 --> 01:48:14.331
Again...

01:48:14.414 --> 01:48:18.414
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what happened.

01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:21.997
You see, I had no idea, really.

01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:24.831
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

01:48:24.914 --> 01:48:29.497
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me...

01:48:29.581 --> 01:48:31.747
my friend.

01:48:31.831 --> 01:48:37.247
I am happy every hour of the day.

01:48:37.372 --> 01:48:41.956
My life is full
because I know that I am loved.

01:48:45.789 --> 01:48:48.581
I have gained myself.

01:48:56.914 --> 01:49:00.581
I could not say that...

01:49:00.664 --> 01:49:02.706
were it not for you.

01:49:06.872 --> 01:49:10.247
Well, and I...

01:49:10.331 --> 01:49:14.164
You've done so much for me as well.

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:15.872
Thank you.

01:49:18.206 --> 01:49:19.747
So...

01:49:20.914 --> 01:49:22.831
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead
and Nora...

01:49:22.914 --> 01:49:25.497
and be back in a few minutes.

01:49:27.914 --> 01:49:29.872
Very good, my friend.

01:49:34.456 --> 01:49:36.414
My friend.

01:52:32.081 --> 01:52:34.331
Mrs. Kendal.

01:52:37.247 --> 01:52:39.414
Thank you.

01:52:39.497 --> 01:52:41.414
Your Royal Highness...

01:52:41.497 --> 01:52:43.247
ladies and gentlemen...

01:52:43.331 --> 01:52:45.789
tonight's performance
was very special to me...

01:52:45.914 --> 01:52:48.414
because it was very special
to someone else.

01:52:48.497 --> 01:52:51.497
A man who knows the theater
and who loves the theater...

01:52:51.581 --> 01:52:54.539
and yet this is the very first time
he's ever been here.

01:52:56.247 --> 01:52:57.539
I wish to dedicate...

01:52:57.622 --> 01:53:00.456
The whole company wishes to dedicate
with all their hearts...

01:53:00.581 --> 01:53:02.956
tonight's performance...

01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:04.997
to Mr. John Merrick...

01:53:05.081 --> 01:53:07.081
my very dear friend.

01:53:19.456 --> 01:53:22.414
Stand up.
They want to see you.

01:53:22.497 --> 01:53:25.247
Go on. It's all right.
Just stand up.

01:53:25.372 --> 01:53:27.289
They want to see you.

01:54:03.706 --> 01:54:07.581
I really did believe that...

01:54:07.706 --> 01:54:11.331
the ogre would never
get out of the dungeon.

01:54:13.122 --> 01:54:16.622
Good.
So you really enjoyed yourself?

01:54:19.414 --> 01:54:20.956
It was wonderful!

01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:25.831
Good. Then we must
go again some evening.

01:54:25.914 --> 01:54:29.039
Oh, yes.
Oh, I hope so.

01:54:29.122 --> 01:54:31.164
Yes, we will.
We will.

01:54:32.706 --> 01:54:35.039
Good. I'm pleased.

01:54:35.122 --> 01:54:38.914
Well, I ought to go.

01:54:39.039 --> 01:54:43.331
You must get some sleep.
Good night, and sleep well.

01:54:45.539 --> 01:54:49.289
- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.

01:54:49.414 --> 01:54:51.831
I'm so pleased
you enjoyed yourself.

01:54:51.914 --> 01:54:54.039
Good night.

01:54:57.497 --> 01:54:59.081
Good night.

01:56:31.372 --> 01:56:32.914
It's finished.

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:08.414
Never, oh, never
nothing will die.

02:00:08.539 --> 02:00:12.831
The stream flows,
the wind blows.

02:00:12.914 --> 02:00:16.872
The cloud fleets,
the heart beats.

02:00:38.247 --> 02:00:40.414
Nothing will die.
