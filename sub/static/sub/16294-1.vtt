02:28.690 --> 02:30.692
Where are we?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.827
Hey, Henson, give me the map.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.161
Huh?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.452
The map... give me the map.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.167
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.042
You need help?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.131
Yeah... no, I got it.
I'm fine.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.295
I'm all right.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.843
Hang in there.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.511
All right.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.274
I think we passed through
Winchester a week ago.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.686
We headed south,
using Route 2.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.105
If we're averaging
20 miles a day...

03:08.271 --> 03:11.115
Right? 20 miles? You think
we're doing 20 miles a day?

03:11.274 --> 03:13.368
I don't think
it's that much, with him.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.325
Well, that would put us

03:15.487 --> 03:17.535
somewhere around here then,
in this shit.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.292
What am I missing here, Rick?

03:20.450 --> 03:23.203
Look, this small ridge

03:23.370 --> 03:24.917
about five miles
west of here

03:25.080 --> 03:28.550
and over those hills
with the river running parallel...

03:28.709 --> 03:31.383
rocky terrain
provides protection;

03:31.545 --> 03:33.718
the river provides
a water source.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.803
It's a perfect place
for them.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.139
Oh, yeah, we should go there then.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.303
Let's pick up the pace.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.771
Quietly.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.935
Let's go.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.527
Rick, this is fucking bullshit.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.163
There's no way in hell we're doing this.
This is a bad idea.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.743
What are you thinking?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.504
What am I thinking?
Okay...

04:06.663 --> 04:09.007
those storm clouds
are coming back

04:09.166 --> 04:12.090
and I'm worried about
Henson getting soaked.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.380
Hey, don't fucking bring me
into this, man.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.265
- You can't even stand.
- He's right.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.596
We're cornering ourselves.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.060
Yeah, well, this is not
about us, Adam.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.526
- Fuck this, Rick.
- Adam, please stop.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.108
- Oh, so I don't get a say?
- Enough already.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.071
No tracks.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.417
That's a start.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.066
Let's go, kid.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.898
And a basement.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.161
Flashlight.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.869
Anything?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.709
Clear.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
Hey.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.227
Just relax, okay?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.387
Relax.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.397
Lie down.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.682
Okay?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.897
- Keep warm.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.564
Oh, man.
Do I get a bedtime story, too?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.233
Oh, sure.
Once upon a time

09:26.399 --> 09:28.572
there was an idiot
called Henson.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.703
Look, I don't like
this place at all.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.746
It seems like
no one has been

09:39.913 --> 09:42.462
in or around here
for a long time,

09:42.624 --> 09:44.501
which is good.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.217
So we rest, we stay dry

09:48.379 --> 09:51.679
and get the hell out
as soon as the rain lets up.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.095
Inventory. Sound off.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.229
Well, I'm still at nine.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.519
15.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.531
I am at eight and three.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.195
Ooh, that is hot.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.449
Kid?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.744
Only six.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.960
41 rounds total.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.251
Not too good.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.793
How are my babies?

10:33.299 --> 10:37.145
Dude, you're getting
way too creepy with those seeds.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.180
Next you'll be naming them.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.147
I already have...
Hope and Faith.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.481
Oh, my God,
you're serious, aren't you?

10:49.274 --> 10:51.618
Mock if you will,
but these are our future,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.323
once we find
a nice place.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.829
Jesus Christ, Rick.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.243
Do me a favor, man.
Not today.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.504
Adam, Adam.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.836
Hey, Adam, hold on.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.001
So what's cooking?

11:14.549 --> 11:18.349
This is the last of the dried rabbit
that we traded for.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.185
And we've got two more

11:21.347 --> 11:23.816
of these mystery suckers left.
That's it.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.362
Guys, we need to find
more food.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.491
Hey!

12:59.654 --> 13:02.077
Do you think Susan is dead?

13:07.537 --> 13:09.756
Susan Markunis
from high school?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.463
You still think about her?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.887
No.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.644
Remember...

13:23.803 --> 13:25.680
remember her and Jenny
at the lake?

13:25.847 --> 13:27.724
Holy shit.
Do you remember that?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.767
Of course.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.312
Oh, man.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.948
It feels like years ago now.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.780
Well, it was.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.866
You think she's dead?
You think Susan's dead...

13:41.029 --> 13:43.532
all these people,

13:43.698 --> 13:45.700
all our friends?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.383
Do I think they're dead?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.919
Yeah. I mean,
is it just us now?

13:56.085 --> 13:58.508
I fucking know they're dead.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.977
You know, she was nice.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.139
She had those...

14:10.808 --> 14:12.856
Susan was a bitch
to you, Rick.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.397
Everybody knew that
but you.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.532
She was a bitch.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.693
Thank you.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.325
You know,

14:26.491 --> 14:28.835
it's weird, thinking about it.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.995
Yeah, don't.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.495
So, preference?

15:53.119 --> 15:56.419
Well, anything
that still has a front door

15:56.581 --> 15:58.128
is always a good sign.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.921
Hey, it's gonna be fine,
just like it always is.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.966
Five minutes, no more.
Watch the clock.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.432
The safety's off.
It's fully loaded.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.432
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.976
Lock the doors.
I'll be right back.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.987
Two honks
if you see anything.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.613
Yes, yes, yes, Yes, yes...

16:31.908 --> 16:32.909
- No!

16:41.584 --> 16:43.257
No!

16:45.922 --> 16:48.175
No!

16:55.223 --> 16:57.100
Make a wish.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.610
I know. It's okay.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.523
It's okay.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.638
Nice day, huh?

17:44.230 --> 17:47.450
Burning gold there.
What are we celebrating?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.281
I know.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.162
Might as well be today.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.750
I know everybody's pretty much
lost somebody...

17:59.912 --> 18:01.755
Don't.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.881
I just need to know.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.466
I just wait to die.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.222
Okay?

18:11.757 --> 18:13.930
Yeah.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.820
We shouldn't stay here.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.919
Come on, get this off me.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.301
Hey, Henson, get some water.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.304
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.136
- Thanks, man.
- Are you all right?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.596
I'm burning
from the inside out.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.891
I've had worse
hangovers, though.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.931
You ready to get
the fuck out of here?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.270
Yeah, I'm ready.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.811
All right, here, get your shirt.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.604
We've been here too long.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.398
It's time to start moving again.
There you go.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.659
He's not going anywhere.
You look terrible.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.364
Sorry, baby, but you do.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.200
- The skies are clearing.
- You hear what I said?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.661
He can't even barely stand up.
What, are we gonna leave him here?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.166
We're sitting ducks right now.
We got to go.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.952
Adam, stop, all right?

19:21.118 --> 19:23.496
Jesus, if he can't walk,
it won't matter if we stay or go.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.132
- Hey, I can manage. Let's go.
- That's right. He can manage.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.213
Wait, not at the speed
that you need to.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.049
We stay the night.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.179
When was the last time we had
a roof over our heads anyway?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.840
Hey.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.054
We have a protocol, right?

19:36.217 --> 19:39.642
Right. And what's more
important right now, Adam? Hope...

19:39.804 --> 19:42.023
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.525
We got to go,
and we got to go right now.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.354
There's no discussion.
We stay

19:48.521 --> 19:50.068
until Henson is
strong enough again.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.359
- Okay, okay.
- We make use of the light.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.653
Adam and I will salvage
what we can from the house.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.823
Ladies, you're on trapping duty.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.410
Fuck.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.501
It's pointless,
and you know it.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.166
It is not pointless.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.506
Haven't even heard a fucking
bird chirp in over two years.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.386
If you got anything more to say,
now's the time.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.055
Hey, man,
I've already said it,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.939
but we've always agreed
it was your call.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.396
Oh, but this isn't
about that, is it?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.039
Hello?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.575
Yep, I'm listening.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.915
Rick, come here.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.677
Oh, my God.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.605
Can you at least try to pretend
to look for tracks?

21:18.694 --> 21:21.117
You know what?
Now don't get me wrong,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.533
you can definitely handle yourself
with that thing,

21:23.699 --> 21:25.576
but since you hooked up
with us,

21:25.743 --> 21:27.745
you barely said a word.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.794
Those three guys back there...
they grew up together.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.633
That's how they've managed
to stay tight through this shit.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.470
And I've been riding
with them since,

21:39.632 --> 21:42.306
I don't know, back when
there were 12 of us.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.647
Now I get it, you're into this
whole lone wolf thing, yeah.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.683
That's fine.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.943
But maybe it would help
overall morale

21:51.101 --> 21:53.524
if you just interjected yourself
just once in a while,

21:53.687 --> 21:55.985
said something... anything.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.901
I mean, what is going on?

22:00.277 --> 22:02.655
We're a family.

22:05.074 --> 22:08.374
Either be part of it or don't.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.539
Do you understand?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.254
That's what I thought.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.181
What the fuck is this?

22:30.057 --> 22:33.857
Hope and Faith, buddy.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.363
Henson, you got to come
take a look at this.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.864
Really?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.283
A dirty-ass basement?

22:50.035 --> 22:52.129
I hate fucking surprises, man.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.881
Don't fucking surprise me
with bullshit.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.757
- Oh, you don't like surprises?
- What you got, man?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.793
All right,

22:57.960 --> 22:59.553
surprise.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.055
- Oh.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.557
- Look at that shit.
- Fuck me, man.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.970
We got food?
Oh, we got food, man.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.559
Lots of food. Look at this...
corned beef. We got sardines.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.022
Tuna fish. What do you like?
What do you like?

23:13.183 --> 23:15.732
I like it all, man.
Oh, I like it all.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.193
- Let's do it.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.624
Oh, shit.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.758
- Are you all right, man?
- Yeah.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.136
Are you strong enough
to carry this upstairs?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.422
Whatever I carry, I eat.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.841
That's the spirit.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.305
Plenty to go around.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.350
Four cans of tuna.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.359
I'm gonna bite a hole
in one of these cans in a minute.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.690
Seven cans of tuna, okay.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.106
Fuck this. I'm hungry.
I'm not waiting.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.195
- Oh, yeah. I'm not waiting.
- Boys, I got to tell you,

25:25.357 --> 25:27.655
I think staying here
was the right call.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.195
What's this?

25:29.361 --> 25:32.535
Rocks? Who the fuck
would put rocks in here?

25:35.409 --> 25:37.002
Rick!

25:39.705 --> 25:41.082
No. No!

25:41.248 --> 25:42.249
Hey! Oh, shit.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.044
No!

25:45.210 --> 25:46.962
- What the fuck is that?

25:47.129 --> 25:49.006
Henson! Henson!

25:50.591 --> 25:52.685
What happened?

25:52.843 --> 25:54.891
What the fuck
is that ringing?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.058
Are there more?

26:01.727 --> 26:03.354
There will be.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.731
I got you.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.946
- I got you. It's okay. It's okay.
- We're fucked, Adam!

26:08.108 --> 26:10.736
Henson! Henson, I need you.
Henson!

26:10.903 --> 26:14.533
We're locked in.
Adam, we're locked in.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.201
Fuck. Okay.
You're okay.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.540
Henson! Henson!

26:19.703 --> 26:21.421
Henson, hey!

26:21.580 --> 26:24.049
Oh, fuck.
He's bleeding everywhere.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.711
I can't stop the bleeding.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.424
Fuck.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.885
It's okay. It's okay.
Fuck, man.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.892
They fucking got him.
Shit.

26:57.783 --> 27:01.458
- He's... he's gone.
- Oh, no.

27:07.251 --> 27:10.551
Rick! Adam!

27:12.256 --> 27:13.303
Guys!

27:13.465 --> 27:16.309
Help! Help!
Let us out of here!

27:17.928 --> 27:20.226
- Get us the fuck out!
- What the fuck is this?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.521
- Guys, can you hear me?
- We're fucked.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.984
- Guys?

27:27.146 --> 27:30.116
What? I can't hear you.
Is Rick okay?

27:30.274 --> 27:33.403
No, he's not okay. He's dead.
We need you to get us out of here.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.280
Shannon, help!

27:36.446 --> 27:37.823
Fuck.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.334
Fuck. No.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.835
Adam, get over here.
I need the light.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.122
- Fuck! Fuck.
- Get over here, Adam.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.461
No.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.501
Shit!

27:52.212 --> 27:54.055
Hey. Hey, Shannon.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.966
- Shannon.
- Huh?

27:56.133 --> 27:59.012
Is there a mechanism or a lever
that might open the door?

27:59.178 --> 28:01.021
I can't find anything.
There's nothing here.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.682
You've got to hurry, Adam.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.646
That ringing
is gonna fucking bring them.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.812
Shannon, Shannon,
you got to go, okay?

28:07.978 --> 28:09.651
You got to go right now.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.657
I'm not gonna leave you here.
Fuck.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.780
We can't be here
when they come.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.448
Fuck you.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.459
Go save your own
fucking skin.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.211
They're my family.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.543
I'll kill every last one of them myself.
I don't give a shit.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.549
No, you'll die quickly.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.382
I'm not scared of them.
I'm not scared of them.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.763
Let's assume there are
a dozen more of these places

28:34.922 --> 28:37.971
spread all over
this countryside.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.885
The bell is a signal.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.225
They'll have an efficient way
of checking their traps.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.980
Oh, God, scouts.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.392
Right.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.859
We can handle this.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.154
It's up to them, okay?

28:55.317 --> 28:57.786
Okay. Okay.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.991
What if they can't do it?

29:36.149 --> 29:37.617
They will.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.699
Fuckers.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.336
Wait for it.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.650
- Hello, meat.
- No, fuck you.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.810
How is it going, fucker?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.149
- Relax.
- Fuck you. You relax.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.448
Why don't you get a hot one
in your head right now?

30:16.606 --> 30:18.449
I'm not even sure
you have bullets.

30:18.608 --> 30:19.951
We got something cooking
for your ass.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.828
Come down here so I can bust
your fucking ass.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.786
Come down here, all of you.
Come down!

30:24.948 --> 30:26.325
Kitchen clear.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.994
- Fuck you. Come join the party, bitch.
- Upstairs clear.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.834
- Keep it down, man.
- I got it, man.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.340
- Do you have the date?
- Fuck you.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.008
Give me your friend.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.674
Hey, fuck you.
Fuck you!

30:41.840 --> 30:43.683
Just give me your friend.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.844
We can catch you guys
another time.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.855
Look, I got another offer
for you, asshole, okay?

30:49.014 --> 30:51.813
Why don't you guys walk out of here and
settle for each other's dicks tonight?

30:51.975 --> 30:54.694
- That's what you do.
- You're all the same, you know.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.278
You all think
you're different.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.033
You're not.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.695
You're just dying
faster than we are.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.740
- Fuck you. Shut up.
 Fine.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.750
Have it your way.
We got supplies.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.584
We can wait for days,
or hours, by the look of you.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.293
No, fuck waiting.
Come down here.

31:14.456 --> 31:17.676
Come down.
I'll bust your fucking ass.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.410
I'm gonna shoot one
of these motherfuckers, man.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.241
Come on.
Are you running, bitch?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.872
Fucking running, huh?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.380
Shannon! Shannon,
what's going on up there?

31:59.543 --> 32:02.012
What the fuck is going on?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.767
- Get her!

32:16.852 --> 32:18.604
Hey! Hey!

32:31.908 --> 32:35.503
You're certainly a pretty piece.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.444
I see.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.205
I see you.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.334
You think you can use
our place...

33:14.493 --> 33:16.962
our place...

33:17.120 --> 33:19.543
to trap all this meat

33:19.706 --> 33:21.674
and not share?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.835
Shut up. Shut up.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.505
Greedy, greedy.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.017
There's enough
to go around, you know.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.144
We'll be back

33:33.303 --> 33:35.522
soon...

33:35.680 --> 33:40.402
to take what's ours.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.536
So stupid.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.204
- Are you okay?
- Rifle, now.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.317
You guys all right?

35:29.461 --> 35:32.260
- Daddy, Daddy.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.307
Tell you what.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.568
Let's go get the others, huh?

35:44.726 --> 35:45.898
Yeah.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.815
Come on, get on.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.447
You're getting big.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.547
Everybody, gather up.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.359
We need to talk.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.368
Fuck it.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.701
Smoke her and let's get out of here.
There's got to be more of them coming.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.116
No, no, no, just wait.
Wait a minute.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.536
Who the fuck are you, huh?

36:45.745 --> 36:47.622
Huh?

36:47.789 --> 36:50.133
I know who she is.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.089
You're one of them.
Isn't that right?

36:53.253 --> 36:55.381
This whole fucking time.

36:57.382 --> 37:01.182
Is it true?
Are you one of them?

37:01.344 --> 37:03.722
Yes.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.061
Let her say it.
Hold on.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.726
Is that fucking right?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.774
Henson, we don't have time
for this shit.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.818
She's one of them
and I'll prove it to you.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.908
Just shoot her
if she tries anything.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.414
Where is it? Huh?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.286
There it is.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.876
Is that your mark?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.126
Oh, fuck.
Oh, this fucking bitch.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.342
So allies to her clan
won't touch her.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.097
But cleverly hidden,
isn't it?

37:38.256 --> 37:40.429
So you can infiltrate
people like us.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.764
You piece of shit.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.393
Did you bring us here
on purpose?

37:49.559 --> 37:52.028
Did you fucking bring us
into this trap?

37:52.187 --> 37:55.612
- Fuck yeah, she did.
- This is bullshit.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.072
Bided her fucking time, too.
Didn't you?

38:01.529 --> 38:04.578
That's for Rick, you cunt.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.745
I can't believe this shit.
I don't fucking believe it.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.464
Why did she kill
all those others, huh?

38:11.623 --> 38:14.627
If she's one of them,
why would she do that?

38:14.793 --> 38:16.670
Maybe it's what that
sick fuck said...

38:16.836 --> 38:20.056
she wanted us for herself.
I don't know.

38:20.215 --> 38:23.845
I don't think there's any common
loyalty between those fucks.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.637
If they aren't in her clan,

38:25.804 --> 38:28.102
they're fucking hamburger
meat just the same.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.517
Am I right, sweetheart?
You can jump in anytime.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.061
Well, why didn't she kill us
fucking weeks ago, huh?

38:33.228 --> 38:34.946
Don't you think
she would have did that?

38:35.104 --> 38:36.151
I don't fucking know, Henson.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.442
Just fucking kill her
and let's get out of here.

38:40.610 --> 38:44.114
You helped us. Why?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.830
Huh? Fucking why?

38:50.787 --> 38:53.131
Well, say something.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.377
Okay.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.591
You fucking say something.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.058
Anything.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.943
Adam. Adam,
just finish her off already.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.608
Adam. Adam!

39:19.774 --> 39:20.991
Come on.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.619
No.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.702
Just finish her.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.709
Not so quickly.
No mercy for her.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.495
No mercy.

39:31.661 --> 39:33.208
God damn it, Adam,
please, let's go, man.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.419
We have time for this.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.755
- No, we don't have time...
- We have time for this!

39:37.917 --> 39:40.045
We have time for this!

39:40.211 --> 39:42.213
No, we fucking don't have time!

39:42.380 --> 39:44.178
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.062
I've seen how you operate.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.066
You don't kill quickly.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.916
You make your prey
walk back to the camp

40:11.075 --> 40:13.419
so you can process
them properly.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.259
It's easier.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.092
It's cleaner.
It's more efficient.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.810
Is that what you did
to my wife and daughter?

40:36.601 --> 40:38.603
Did you make them walk?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.440
Come on, Adam,
let's get out of here.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.530
Hey, go ahead if you want.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.411
It's already too fucking late.
They're already on their way.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.823
There's nothing around here
for miles.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.208
They'll track us down in less
than a day. You're already dead.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.788
We all are.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.136
So, with what little time
I have left,

41:04.295 --> 41:06.673
I want to spend with you.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.841
Okay?

41:12.470 --> 41:15.440
How did you kill them, huh?

41:15.598 --> 41:17.475
Was it like it used to be
with cows,

41:17.642 --> 41:21.067
just like a quick blow to the head?

41:21.229 --> 41:23.448
Or...

41:27.151 --> 41:29.654
did you...
did you torture them?

41:32.365 --> 41:35.289
Did you...
did you cut my little baby up?

41:35.451 --> 41:37.328
Did you cut her up
before you cooked her?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.168
Is that what you did?

41:39.330 --> 41:43.506
I... I didn't kill your family.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.421
But you're part of them.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.840
So you're responsible.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.305
It means you chose
to be like them.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.844
You chose to do it.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.140
I... I chose to live.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.524
No.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.186
You chose to murder.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.780
Come on, God damn it, Adam.
That's enough.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.614
No.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.711
No, please.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.087
No.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.044
When my baby...

42:22.206 --> 42:25.176
- ...was first eating soft food...

42:25.334 --> 42:27.757
she used to love this.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.386
Adam, what are you doing, man?
Come on.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.976
Open up for the airplane.
Come on.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.984
Open up. Open up.
Open up for the airplane.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.240
Open your fucking mouth!

42:49.817 --> 42:50.864
No?

42:51.027 --> 42:53.450
Adam, just get on with it.

42:53.613 --> 42:54.956
Shit.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.411
I guess we're gonna have
to find something

42:56.574 --> 42:59.248
a little more appetizing, huh?

43:02.663 --> 43:04.586
Have you ever wondered
what your heart looks like?

43:13.549 --> 43:14.766
Yes!

43:14.926 --> 43:18.305
Yes, Yes, yes!

43:18.471 --> 43:21.145
Yes, fucking kill me!

43:21.307 --> 43:24.937
Kill me, please!

43:25.103 --> 43:27.105
Please.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.820
Please just... just cut me up

43:29.982 --> 43:32.155
and leave me to rot, please.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.537
Please.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.198
I know what I am.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.914
And I fucking deserve it.
I fucking do.

43:40.076 --> 43:43.922
You're goddamn right!
You're goddamn right, you do.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.458
Then just do it!

43:54.966 --> 43:58.186
She was just...
she was just six.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.598
She was just six.
She was so fucking little.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.283
Today was her birthday.

44:18.072 --> 44:21.201
Adam, I didn't kill
your daughter.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.790
You all did.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.172
You all killed her.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.003
And I'm gonna make you pay.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.339
I'm gonna make you pay
for everybody.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.004
I was trying to survive.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.551
What the hell
are you doing?

44:37.717 --> 44:39.685
Yeah, man.

44:39.844 --> 44:42.267
What are you doing,
Adam, huh?

44:42.430 --> 44:44.808
What are you fucking
doing, man?

44:44.974 --> 44:47.693
This is justice.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.531
Is that what this is?

44:53.649 --> 44:55.947
Huh?

44:56.110 --> 44:57.987
Put the knife down, brother,

44:58.154 --> 44:59.872
and back away from her.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.035
Put it down.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.328
Put it down.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.997
So you're on her side now?

45:09.790 --> 45:12.134
No.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.045
I love you, man,

45:14.212 --> 45:17.557
but I'm not gonna sit here
and let you butcher her like that.

45:19.300 --> 45:22.850
That's the difference
between them and us.

45:23.012 --> 45:26.232
But if you want to kill her,
let's get it over with.

45:33.022 --> 45:35.525
We got to get
the fuck out of here.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.210
God damn you all.

45:50.373 --> 45:54.219
I didn't lead you here.

45:55.378 --> 45:57.255
I don't care.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.393
I didn't miss.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.404
I didn't miss.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.610
- Don't.
- Adam.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.616
- Say it, Adam.
- Don't.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.697
Don't you fucking dare.

46:22.863 --> 46:26.163
Say the fucking word.
Say it.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.459
I had a little sister,

46:30.621 --> 46:33.249
12 years old.

46:35.876 --> 46:39.005
She fell and broke her leg,

46:39.171 --> 46:40.593
bad.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.311
Twisted bone
sticking out,

46:45.469 --> 46:48.188
too fragmented
to just reset.

46:50.558 --> 46:53.027
She would slow us down
and die of infection in a week.

46:57.732 --> 47:01.077
Maybe they couldn't heal her.

47:04.363 --> 47:06.616
But she was one of our own.

47:08.993 --> 47:11.462
They strung her up...

47:15.750 --> 47:18.344
and slit her throat.

47:20.171 --> 47:23.300
They drank and bottled her blood
as it poured out of her.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.889
They cooked and ate
her major organs that night.

47:39.148 --> 47:42.402
Three nights later I stabbed them
all to death in their sleep.

47:45.112 --> 47:48.412
Look, it doesn't change
what I once was.

47:50.201 --> 47:53.045
I know that.

47:53.204 --> 47:56.959
If you want to take me out
in that field

47:57.124 --> 48:00.219
and put a bullet in my head,
I won't resist.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.255
I promise.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.514
But he's right.

48:08.761 --> 48:10.980
They are coming.

48:13.974 --> 48:17.069
And you won't last two days in the open
country if they're tracking you.

48:18.270 --> 48:21.649
You either have to split up and run
or you make a stand here.

48:21.816 --> 48:24.535
What makes you think
we'll last here?

48:24.693 --> 48:26.946
You probably won't,

48:27.113 --> 48:28.990
but you have a better chance.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.126
You have fortification

48:32.284 --> 48:34.457
and you know
they're on their way.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.503
And...

48:41.460 --> 48:43.713
you have me.

48:44.713 --> 48:47.307
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

48:49.468 --> 48:52.642
What the fuck do you think
I want to do, hmm?

48:52.805 --> 48:55.183
I want to kill them all.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.173
You want to bandage that up
with something?

49:23.335 --> 49:25.212
It won't matter.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.098
Won't this piss them off
even more?

49:29.800 --> 49:33.054
At least they'll know
who they're fucking with.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.440
We're all gonna die,
you know.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.853
And frankly, I think
it's too easy for you.

49:40.019 --> 49:42.989
Maybe you can
prove me wrong.

50:23.395 --> 50:25.397
You're missed, old friend.

50:28.234 --> 50:31.955
If we weren't sure before,
they'll certainly be coming now.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.911
It's better that than to have them
dig him up and make a meal.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.587
Don't you pretend like
he meant anything to you.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.090
He was a good leader.

50:50.798 --> 50:53.597
This world has existed

50:53.759 --> 50:55.102
for over 10 years now.

50:57.304 --> 51:00.057
There was
enough shit and blood,

51:00.224 --> 51:02.272
starvation and death
in that first year

51:02.434 --> 51:04.436
to fill a hundred lifetimes.

51:10.109 --> 51:12.578
Nine friends have died before us,
died protecting us,

51:12.736 --> 51:14.909
and now we're all that's left.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.791
It would be a fucking insult to them
if we lied down like dogs

51:17.950 --> 51:21.045
and let these fucking animals
take us so easily.

51:23.664 --> 51:26.258
I hope they send
100 of those sick fucks.

51:27.793 --> 51:30.421
Means more for us to kill
and less of them left in this world.

51:31.964 --> 51:34.763
So tonight I'm fighting for you
and you,

51:34.925 --> 51:38.099
'cause you're my family now.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.560
And I fear for all the soulless
pieces of shit

51:40.723 --> 51:42.441
that try to get into
this house tonight.

51:54.403 --> 51:56.826
I don't know
why we're trusting her.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.542
She's not lying about wanting to kill
the ones coming for us,

52:00.701 --> 52:03.045
whatever her reasons may be.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.380
And, shit, we need the muscle.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.045
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

52:11.211 --> 52:14.806
She ain't gonna survive the night
one way or another.

52:17.593 --> 52:19.186
Are you with me?

52:21.722 --> 52:23.099
Yeah.

52:23.265 --> 52:25.142
Great speech, buddy.

52:25.309 --> 52:28.028
It even trumps the one
you gave at Gilford

52:28.187 --> 52:30.815
our senior year
in the semifinals.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.131
If I remember,
we lost to Gilford.

52:57.925 --> 53:00.849
It's getting late.
We need to get ready.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.791
Don't worry.

54:10.038 --> 54:12.587
They're gonna pay
for what they've done.

54:15.127 --> 54:17.221
And then we'll eat.

54:27.556 --> 54:29.809
Look to this day,

54:29.975 --> 54:32.603
where yesterday
has been a dream

54:32.770 --> 54:36.365
and tomorrow
only a vision,

54:36.523 --> 54:39.493
and every tomorrow

54:39.651 --> 54:41.824
a vision of hope.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.836
We know there is
at least one gun.

54:50.913 --> 54:53.382
Find out what else
we're up against.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.542
Go.

55:08.472 --> 55:13.103
You look, you listen,

55:13.268 --> 55:15.521
and then you learn.

55:15.687 --> 55:18.190
And one day you will lead.

55:18.357 --> 55:20.359
Go now.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.863
Your brother is gonna be
very strong one day.

55:25.614 --> 55:28.709
But you, my darling,

55:28.867 --> 55:31.211
are gonna be
so much stronger.

55:38.001 --> 55:39.878
What have we got?

55:40.045 --> 55:43.390
Hard to see.
More than 20.

55:43.549 --> 55:45.722
- Fuck.

55:45.884 --> 55:48.182
We're in for one hell
of a night, y'all.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.894
Save your bullets
as a last resort.

55:51.056 --> 55:52.228
This is our last resort.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.610
Locked and loaded.
Let the countdown begin.

55:54.768 --> 55:57.191
Hey, take these.
I don't believe in redemption

55:57.354 --> 55:59.027
for someone like you,
but if you...

55:59.189 --> 56:00.691
fuck.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.911
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.744
Save those fucking
bullets, man.

56:32.556 --> 56:35.275
Bring me

56:35.434 --> 56:36.936
their heads.

56:39.813 --> 56:41.156
Now!

56:48.906 --> 56:51.455
There's more coming at us.
Come on.

56:51.617 --> 56:53.915
Come on, you fuckers.

56:54.077 --> 56:55.954
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

56:56.121 --> 56:58.544
- They're in for a treat now.
- Make 'em count, every one.

56:58.707 --> 57:01.335
Come on. Come on
and get some, bitch, come on.

57:04.671 --> 57:07.766
Get some, come on.
Five bullets down, two dead.

57:10.969 --> 57:12.596
God damn it,
Adam, your window!

57:13.805 --> 57:16.399
I got four that ain't us, Adam.
They're heading your way, man.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.479
Got them coming
around the back.

57:49.216 --> 57:50.593
Henson!

57:51.843 --> 57:53.641
Henson!

58:18.370 --> 58:20.589
Adam.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.505
God damn it.

58:24.668 --> 58:26.295
Get him some water.
Get him some water.

58:27.379 --> 58:29.302
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

58:29.464 --> 58:31.341
- Hurry up.
- Feels like I ran back-to-back

58:31.508 --> 58:34.227
marathons up a hill
with pneumonia

58:34.386 --> 58:36.559
with these fucking freaks
chasing me, man.

58:36.722 --> 58:38.099
Get some rest.
Get some rest.

58:38.265 --> 58:40.688
What's the count at?

58:40.851 --> 58:43.229
I just got three.
God damn it.

58:43.395 --> 58:45.989
I got six in the pistol,
four in the rifle.

58:46.148 --> 58:48.367
- I'm still at three.
- Mary.

58:49.609 --> 58:51.327
- Mary.
- Five.

58:51.486 --> 58:54.365
Five. All right. I'm gonna cover
for your lazy ass, all right?

58:54.531 --> 58:56.579
Cover for mine.

59:00.996 --> 59:03.215
You, you and you...

59:03.373 --> 59:05.842
you have to find
your way inside.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.503
We're not going anywhere.

59:07.669 --> 59:10.764
I need someone to get up there quietly
and find out how many there really are.

59:10.922 --> 59:13.471
Knock on the front door,
go through the goddamn window...

59:13.633 --> 59:16.728
I don't care.
Do it now and do it fast.

59:16.887 --> 59:18.889
Go.

59:26.855 --> 59:30.610
They're gonna come again,
harder and in full force.

59:30.776 --> 59:31.948
No shit, genius.

59:37.407 --> 59:39.785
What the fuck
are you looking at, huh?

59:41.244 --> 59:42.837
Don't you fucking
look at me.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.124
Don't you ever fucking look
at me again, you hear me?

59:45.290 --> 59:47.463
Don't you fucking look at me
fucking ever!

59:47.626 --> 59:49.424
Shannon, cover the window.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.963
You fucking hear me?

59:51.129 --> 59:53.382
I wasn't fucking talking to you.

59:53.548 --> 59:54.765
- Fuck you.
- Shannon, come on.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.804
We got a bigger fight.
Stop.

59:57.969 --> 59:59.596
I say we send her out there

59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.391
to hold them over while we
fucking get the fuck out of here.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:03.809
What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.977
- Shannon, stop, God damn it.
- Fuck!

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:12.819
No. No!

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.784
Shannon,
what did you do?

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:28.042
The roof. The roof.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:51.648
Come on.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.408
Fuck off.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.343
My boy.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.862
My boy.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.943
Hey, that was my idea.

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.449
You gonna have
all the fun?

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.493
Hey, hey.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.913
- Fuck, man.
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.548
I only have one bullet, man.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.084
Are you okay?
Are you all right, man?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.969
Just breathe. We got them.
We got them good.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.050
- Get out of here, man.

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.090
Go. Get the fuck out, go.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.850
Hey.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.230
Mary, cover the front.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:27.479
And that's zero,
motherfucker.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.482
Shannon.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.521
Henson!

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.690
Henson, help me!

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.609
Argh! No!

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.997
Come on, Shannon, go.
Come on.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.413
- Come on.
- Come on, Henson.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.578
- Come on, go. Get in the house.
- Come on.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:54.624
Get in the house.
Come on, go. I ain't coming.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.211
Come on, come on.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.251
I'll take care of these
motherfuckers.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.546
Come on, come get some.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:02.931
'Cause you picked
a wrong motherfucker.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.013
Come on. Four.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.304
Three.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.723
Where are you at, bitch?
Two.

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:14.401
One.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.021
Oh, fuck.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.487
Oh, fuck.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.949
Oh, you'll never
knock me down, man.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.372
And I hope I make
all of y'all sick, motherfucker.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.346
Here, take it.
Cover the kitchen.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.475
Where's Henson?

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.436
What?

01:04:57.602 --> 01:05:00.651
No. No.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.282
Fuck.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.286
What the fuck?

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:40.959
Are we just gonna
stay in here forever?

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.469
They eat their own,
don't they?

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.481
I mean, shit, we killed enough
of them to feed them for a month.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.858
Why the hell
are they still after us?

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.394
They're still human.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.318
What's more human
than revenge?

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.360
So now this is my fault?

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.075
This is about the boy?

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.080
Do it now!

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:19.745
Fuck.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.793
Stay back.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.713
Well, it's about time.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.098
I figured they would have done that
earlier, save themselves trouble.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.725
They weren't gonna destroy the house
if they didn't have to.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.260
All right, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:36.814
Well, we're not gonna
stay in here and burn.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.517
We got seven
coming up the front.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.603
- How many shots in that rifle?
- Just one.

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.108
Use it.

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:44.315
No, save it.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.280
Mary, what are you doing?

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.692
I'm stalling them while you two
run out the back.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.240
I need to do this.

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.744
Do you think
this changes anything?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.412
No.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.790
No.

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.513
I'm just tired of waiting.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.227
Come on, Adam, let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.357
Whoa. Take it easy.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.154
Are you sure you got enough bullets
in that thing for all of us?

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.411
The ones inside are mine.

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:46.752
I brought them here.
I trapped them.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:49.508
They're my kill.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.340
Oh?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:54.051
Your kill?

01:08:56.549 --> 01:09:00.349
So you're not
with them, huh?

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.934
Yeah, I don't know
why I didn't see it before.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.270
There's a look that people get
when they're seeing something

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:08.653
they've never seen before.
You... you don't have that look.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.774
So you should know
that this is

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.533
an invitation-only party.

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:17.946
This is our land,

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.705
our kill.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.707
And now you...

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.163
you belong to us, too.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.837
My boy.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.295
For your head.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.553
You know,
and if you're gonna do it, do it.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.430
Shoot me.
Go ahead, do it.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.011
Either way you're gonna be
the prize pig at my camp tonight.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.683
Oh.

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.895
You fuckers.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:48.901
Fuck!

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.937
Adam.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.106
I can't leave her.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.993
Just forget her
and let's go.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.707
She's dead.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.168
Why would you do that?

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.299
The plan, Adam...

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:14.711
making sure she doesn't
survive the night.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.049
Or are you forgetting
she's one of them?

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.214
- She's not one of them.
- Yes, she is.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.600
- She's not one of them.
- What are you doing?

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.601
Just go.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.512
- Just go!

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.295
Pretty.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.380
You're mine.
You're mine.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:01.891
No!

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.227
I am now gonna taste

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.192
your raw, sweet pain, bitch.
You hear me?

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.820
Come on, come on, come on.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:24.580
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.721
Die, you fucks.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.398
Come on. Okay.

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:39.064
Come on. Come on.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.686
Where the fuck are you,
little son of a...?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:58.544
Your wife and daughter...

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.047
what were their names?

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:04.421
Nikki

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.756
and Ava.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:13.259
She was such a happy kid.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.557
Nothing ever got to her,
even in this.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.404
That's because she was loved
every second she was alive.

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:29.571
She had her family.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.415
I couldn't protect them.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:43.669
What matters is you did
for as long as you could.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.169
You loved them
enough to try.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.185
Why did you come back?

01:15:57.428 --> 01:15:59.772
Nothing's changed

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.558
in so long.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.482
I know who
is waiting for me.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:17.616
Maybe I was just looking
for a sign,

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:21.127
something to make them
proud of me again.

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:26.795
Maybe that was you.

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:33.131
Maybe I was just tired
of being the victim.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.931
It was the right thing to do.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.901
Oh, my God.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.937
It's so peaceful.

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:52.149
Yeah.

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.701
Yeah.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.499
You have the chance
to learn to live again.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.128
Don't waste it.
