00:18.875 --> 00:24.750
[narrator] On September 11th, 2001, something happened that
affected me for the rest of my life.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.708
[baby crying]

00:27.708 --> 00:29.791
[doctor] Look who's ready for the world!

00:31.125 --> 00:32.125
[narrator] I was born.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.750
I wasn't the first kid to be born on a bad day.

00:39.166 --> 00:42.375
There were kids born on Sandy Hook, Columbine, Pearl
Harbor...

00:44.000 --> 00:47.041
but notice how none of them were named by the date on the
calendar?

00:47.625 --> 00:50.083
That only happened with September 11th.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.958
So what am I supposed to do with a birthday like that?

00:53.500 --> 00:56.791
It's not like I can call it "Danny Day" and expect you to
know what I'm talking about.

00:57.583 --> 01:00.291
I have to say it's September 11th.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.875
You can see how I developed some issues.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.833
[narrator] If you think the other kids were nice and
understanding about it

01:07.833 --> 01:09.500
you've been watching too many movies.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.416
[laughs] Nice one Danny Doom!

01:13.625 --> 01:14.916
[narrator] That's what they called me.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.083
Danny Doom.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.708
Because somehow everything about me was a disaster.

01:19.541 --> 01:20.541
He should have a party.

01:20.541 --> 01:21.458
But it's awkward.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.000
Why? 9/11 wasn't his fault.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.458
Right, it wasn't his fault.

01:24.458 --> 01:25.916
No, it was W's, right?

01:25.916 --> 01:28.083
Obama would have saved the day like a superhero!

01:28.083 --> 01:29.458
[mom] Don't you dare make fun of him!

01:29.458 --> 01:33.291
[narrator] After mom left, dad tried having a party for
me...

01:33.291 --> 01:34.208
but no one came.

01:35.166 --> 01:38.375
Either because they didn't want to see me, or him.

01:38.375 --> 01:39.625
Happy September 11th.

01:41.416 --> 01:43.833
[narrator] And so, since no one wanted to be my friend,

01:43.833 --> 01:45.916
I developed a life of the mind.

01:45.916 --> 01:47.708
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

01:47.708 --> 01:52.583
Today I have something very important to say, so that means
you all must listen.

01:52.708 --> 01:54.916
That includes you, Mr. Ballinger.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.375
[narrator] Then in high school, I met someone who changed
my life.

01:57.375 --> 01:57.916
Hey!

01:58.208 --> 01:59.541
New youth group.

02:01.791 --> 02:03.125
Everyone's welcome.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.291
[narrator] His name was Jesus.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.458
See you there!

02:06.541 --> 02:08.208
[narrator] I was born again.

02:08.416 --> 02:11.000
Which I was happy about because the first time hadn't gone
so well.

02:11.375 --> 02:12.166
Amen.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.500
[narrator] Things were all right after that.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.041
Until the day I got the news that changed everything.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.291
So what's the news?

02:21.333 --> 02:23.375
It'll take some time to explain.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.916
Perhaps we could sit down?

02:25.666 --> 02:26.583
Sure.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.333
I appreciate you having me by on such short notice.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.250
I'm always happy to see you, Pastor.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.833
Although I don't know why you couldn't have just texted me.

02:37.208 --> 02:41.333
Well... some things are best said when looking someone in
the eye.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.625
So last night I met with the elders to discuss your
proposal.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.750
They thought it was very ambitious.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.583
Starting a drama ministry,

02:51.666 --> 02:53.041
joining the church staff,

02:53.125 --> 02:55.875
and all while attending Bible college full time?

02:56.041 --> 02:56.541
[text chime]

02:58.291 --> 02:59.666
I know it's a lot.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.583
I can handle it.

03:01.666 --> 03:03.666
That's exactly the question they had.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.541
How would he handle it?

03:05.625 --> 03:06.583
I'll find a way.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.416
I want to help people find hope in Jesus.

03:08.666 --> 03:09.375
Like I have.

03:09.458 --> 03:09.958
[text chime]

03:11.291 --> 03:11.791
[text chime]

03:12.291 --> 03:13.875
Could you turn that off, please?

03:13.958 --> 03:15.583
I'd rather we speak uninterrupted.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.041
Sure, no problem.

03:18.416 --> 03:22.208
What you proposed would be extremely difficult.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.500
Temptation would come your way that you could not give in
to.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.250
I know. That's why I want to do it.

03:27.291 --> 03:27.583
[call tone]

03:27.666 --> 03:29.125
Hey, did you hear the news?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.375
I gotta call you back, Beau.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.625
[Beau] This is an emergency.

03:33.666 --> 03:35.250
Okay, all right. Well tell me later.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.291
Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.500
♬

03:41.000 --> 03:43.208
So, like I was saying...

03:43.708 --> 03:45.625
Full time ministry is not easy.

03:46.125 --> 03:46.916
And many who are...

03:46.916 --> 03:49.541
[narrator] Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend?

03:50.666 --> 03:54.333
Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend!

03:55.625 --> 03:56.500
Danny?

03:56.750 --> 03:57.791
[narrator] Beau was right.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.125
This was an emergency.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.958
Excuse me, please.

04:03.916 --> 04:05.916
[narrator] I knew Megan from Bible Club at school.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.625
She had been dating Damian for a year,

04:07.625 --> 04:09.208
even though he wasn't a Christian.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.166
A lucky break.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.208
Finally.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.750
It was time to act.

04:15.541 --> 04:41.166
♬

04:43.332 --> 04:44.291
Hey Megan.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.916
Hi, Donny.

04:49.082 --> 04:49.791
It's Danny.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.166
Danny. Right. Sorry.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.582
Nah, that's cool.

04:57.291 --> 04:59.582
So what brings you by?

05:00.291 --> 05:03.875
I... wanted... to see you.

05:05.416 --> 05:06.750
How do you know where I live?

05:06.958 --> 05:07.916
I follow you.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.500
Online. Um...

05:10.625 --> 05:12.125
You've posted pictures of your house.

05:12.666 --> 05:13.916
Oh. Okay.

05:14.125 --> 05:14.666
Um...

05:15.791 --> 05:16.750
So what's up?

05:17.832 --> 05:19.957
I... I heard the news.

05:20.332 --> 05:21.332
And uh...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.041
that's crazy.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.500
You were supposed to go on tour with him, right?

05:25.500 --> 05:26.625
That was the plan.

05:26.625 --> 05:27.207
Ha!

05:29.500 --> 05:30.082
Uh...

05:30.082 --> 05:31.250
listen, Danny...

05:31.250 --> 05:33.416
I'm busy, but...

05:33.416 --> 05:35.250
thanks for stopping by.

05:35.250 --> 05:35.875
No, no, wait!

05:35.875 --> 05:36.707
Um...

05:36.707 --> 05:38.041
I have to tell you something.

05:38.332 --> 05:38.791
Um...

05:39.957 --> 05:40.916
I wanted to tell you...

05:41.875 --> 05:42.500
that...

05:43.832 --> 05:45.082
you should be encouraged.

05:46.207 --> 05:47.250
Because...

05:47.250 --> 05:48.791
God has someone else for you.

05:49.332 --> 05:50.082
Oh.

05:50.582 --> 05:52.750
You came by to encourage me?

05:52.832 --> 05:53.582
Well...

05:53.957 --> 05:54.791
yeah.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.166
Aw, that's so sweet.

05:57.332 --> 05:58.957
You're such a nice guy, Danny.

05:59.541 --> 06:01.041
Thanks. I really needed that.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.916
Yeah? Well, you know, there's more where that came from.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.208
Because, um...

06:08.208 --> 06:09.625
now that you're available...

06:09.666 --> 06:10.875
I thought, um...

06:11.666 --> 06:12.708
that, uh...

06:13.333 --> 06:14.250
you and I...

06:14.916 --> 06:15.958
should...

06:16.625 --> 06:17.791
get coffee.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.875
Uh, thanks, Danny, but...

06:21.875 --> 06:22.916
I'm busy.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.082
No, not right now.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.375
I just meant, um, sometime when you're free.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.832
I'll be busy for awhile.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.125
Doing what?

06:33.500 --> 06:35.041
The tour was gonna be all summer.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.707
Something came up.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.207
Wait, are you saying...

06:45.457 --> 06:46.332
Really?

06:49.416 --> 06:51.166
But you broke up with Damian.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.666
Yeah. This morning.

06:52.791 --> 06:55.250
I know. That's why I came over.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.041
Danny, you can't just ask me for a date out of the blue.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.250
It's not out of the blue.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.416
I've been thinking about this for months.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.625
Thank you, again, for the encouragement, but...

07:05.625 --> 07:07.500
God has someone else for you, too.

07:10.416 --> 07:14.166
♬

07:14.166 --> 07:19.707
[narrator] Have you ever had a moment where you realized
something you believed in completely was completely wrong?

07:20.791 --> 07:22.541
I had a dream where Megan and Damian broke up

07:22.541 --> 07:24.916
and she went out with me instead.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.916
I thought if the break up happened in real life

07:26.916 --> 07:29.791
it would be a sign from God that I should ask her out.

07:30.582 --> 07:33.332
But then what you just saw happen happened.

07:33.916 --> 07:35.875
Danny Doom strikes again.

07:43.791 --> 07:44.791
Danny.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.041
Hey, Pastor.

07:47.332 --> 07:49.041
So glad you're back.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.125
Can we continue?

07:52.750 --> 07:53.707
Sure.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.041
It sounded like you had bad news for me?

07:58.041 --> 08:00.041
Well, actually, it's good news.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.041
Your proposal's been accepted.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.208
I was trying to be dramatic before.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.791
I thought you'd like that.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.458
Then you left for an hour.

08:08.666 --> 08:11.583
And I was thinking, should I stay? Should I go?

08:12.208 --> 08:13.791
Real plot twist for me.

08:13.791 --> 08:15.083
Sorry about that.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.125
Something came up.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.791
Well, you got it all.

08:20.082 --> 08:23.041
The internship. The drama program. The scholarship.

08:23.332 --> 08:25.375
You're in full time ministry now.

08:25.791 --> 08:30.500
And... the elders and I believe you should not be called
Danny Doom

08:30.500 --> 08:32.415
but Danny Do.

08:32.540 --> 08:36.165
Because you're gonna do great things for the Lord.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.040
Thank you.

08:38.790 --> 08:40.250
That's all I ever wanted.

08:40.332 --> 08:41.750
[narrator] Which was true.

08:41.750 --> 08:42.415
Yesterday.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.500
Did something happen with that girl?

08:46.500 --> 08:46.915
No.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.000
What girl?

08:49.790 --> 08:51.083
The one Beau called you about.

08:52.415 --> 08:54.165
Beau's always saying crazy things.

08:55.165 --> 08:56.500
I wouldn't worry about it.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.250
Okay.

08:59.333 --> 09:03.333
Well, even though I'm your boss now,

09:03.333 --> 09:04.958
I'm still your pastor.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.875
You can talk to me.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Thank you.

09:10.541 --> 09:11.875
I appreciate that.

09:13.541 --> 09:14.166
Well...

09:15.833 --> 09:18.541
be ready for joys and sorrows.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.166
There's a big spotlight on you now.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.041
But it's not about you.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.041
You have to help people see Jesus.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.916
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.375
And when you're tempted to be selfish...

09:31.875 --> 09:33.750
you'll have to fight yourself.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.915
Are you ready for that?

09:38.958 --> 09:42.540
It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining on all God made.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.458
What a beautiful day to tell our friend Hambone about Jesus.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.540
Hello there, Hambone!

09:50.540 --> 09:51.540
Hello.

09:52.165 --> 09:53.915
What have you been up to, Hambone?

09:53.915 --> 09:55.958
Playing rockin' shows with my band.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.165
I have a question for you, Hambone.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.791
What do you believe about Jesus?

10:02.375 --> 10:03.875
That dude from a million years ago?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.416
What's it matter?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.708
Jesus died for our sins, Hambone.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.625
It matters lot's.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.500
You know what's a lot cooler than a dead guy?

10:13.500 --> 10:14.625
A live guy.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.583
Like this guy playing live at the Paramount tonight.

10:17.666 --> 10:20.333
But Hambone, Jesus is alive!

10:28.291 --> 10:30.333
But Hambone, Jesus is alive!

10:38.500 --> 10:39.125
But Hambone --

10:39.125 --> 10:41.375
At my show tonight there's gonna be a choir!

10:41.458 --> 10:45.415
A choir of drunk babes!

10:46.625 --> 10:47.875
But Hambone, Jesus is alive --

10:47.875 --> 10:52.083
After the show me and the drunk babes are gonna go scream at
old people

10:52.083 --> 10:54.250
to give them heart attacks.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.165
But Hambone --

10:55.165 --> 10:56.500
And when the paramedics come

10:56.500 --> 11:00.041
we're gonna steal an ambulance and go joy riding around for
car crashes.

11:00.041 --> 11:03.875
And when the people see us and they say, "We're saved!"

11:03.875 --> 11:06.125
We're gonna smash into them!

11:07.041 --> 11:09.208
And then their mothers are gonna show up and cry.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.958
And we will pull their hair out.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.458
But Hambone, Jesus is alive!

11:20.666 --> 11:23.208
Alive? How is that possible?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.708
Because Jesus is God!

11:24.708 --> 11:27.125
After he died, he rose again!

11:27.208 --> 11:29.083
And if we repent and believe

11:29.083 --> 11:31.416
we'll have life after death with him.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.375
Whoa. You know what I think?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.000
What do you think, Hambone?

11:38.750 --> 11:40.333
Jesus rocks.

11:44.165 --> 11:46.000
Bye, guys! Bye!

11:46.165 --> 11:47.540
What was with the improv?

11:47.625 --> 11:48.875
Inspiration struck.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.500
Well if it strikes again, I'm striking you.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.958
You made us look like idiots.

11:51.958 --> 11:52.708
Who cares?

11:52.750 --> 11:54.083
The kids liked it.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.540
Where was this inspiration when you were writing the script?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.790
The muse visits when she pleases.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.250
You've been nothing but negative lately.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.583
What's the matter with you?

12:01.958 --> 12:04.208
Oh man, you did it. Didn't you?

12:04.625 --> 12:05.250
Did what?

12:05.250 --> 12:06.708
Asked out Megan Hendrickson.

12:06.708 --> 12:07.958
But she has a boyfriend.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.208
Not since last week.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.666
When did you do it?

12:10.875 --> 12:11.916
After we talked.

12:12.208 --> 12:14.083
Oh man, right after?

12:15.791 --> 12:17.291
Danny Doom strikes again!

12:17.375 --> 12:20.208
You're the one who called the breakup emergency news.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.291
Yeah, cause I never thought it would happen.

12:22.291 --> 12:25.208
I also never thought you'd ask her out the same day.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.291
What's wrong with that?

12:26.333 --> 12:27.500
Well did she say yes?

12:27.541 --> 12:28.083
No.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.208
That's what's wrong with that.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.833
Okay. Everything I do is wrong.

12:30.958 --> 12:31.708
Good talk, guys.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.500
It seems we need to speak in a language you understand.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.750
So may we present...

12:37.040 --> 12:39.165
The Error of Danny's Ways!

12:39.165 --> 12:40.958
A play in one act.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.875
I shall play the part of Megan.

12:42.915 --> 12:44.375
Good luck finding an audience.

12:45.083 --> 12:49.000
Our play begins with the young lady lamenting the loss of
her lover.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.458
[with accent] Lawdy, lawdy, I'm so lonely.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.790
For the bond between my dear Damian and I has been torn
asunder.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.125
Why is she Southern?

12:56.250 --> 13:01.750
Hark! It is as if light hath shined from the heavens upon
your fair face, sweet Megan.

13:01.833 --> 13:05.708
My, my. What a sudden and obvious show of affection. I do
declare.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.000
So you're Southern and he's Shakespeare?

13:08.041 --> 13:08.833
That makes no sense.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.250
Dear, sweet Megan, I shall unpack my heart before you.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.791
Tis true, we've never spoken before...

13:13.791 --> 13:14.541
Tis not true!

13:14.541 --> 13:18.041
Yet I have spent hours, days, months

13:18.041 --> 13:22.458
gazing at your image on the screen for I worship your beauty
like an idol.

13:22.666 --> 13:25.708
Land a' Goshen! How uncomfortable this makes me.

13:25.833 --> 13:28.916
I shall take no notice of your discomfort and continue my
entreaty.

13:29.166 --> 13:32.333
For, despite all evidence to the contrary

13:32.333 --> 13:37.958
I do believe this is the perfect time and manner of which to
ask you for a date.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.500
You and I on a date? [laughs]

13:40.750 --> 13:41.958
Is the Pope Protestant?

13:42.040 --> 13:42.915
What's this?

13:42.915 --> 13:44.208
No, you say?

13:44.208 --> 13:45.665
However could this be?

13:45.708 --> 13:49.625
It is the customary response to those who approach a lady in
such a manner.

13:50.375 --> 13:53.790
Oh, how devastated I am by this unforeseen outcome!

13:54.250 --> 13:54.915
Alas...

13:55.665 --> 14:01.375
I shall die alone! For I failed to heed the advice of my
friends.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.875
Two thumbs down.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.791
The contrived narrative was insulting to the audience.

14:07.791 --> 14:09.083
We're trying to help you.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.666
You don't have to do anything crazy to get a girlfriend.
Just be yourself.

14:12.666 --> 14:13.958
And it will happen.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.250
Probably with someone you just happen be around.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.166
Someone I just happen to be around.

14:23.541 --> 14:24.791
Maybe that's what I was missing!

14:25.291 --> 14:27.916
So the next few days I happened to be around Megan all the
time.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.958
♬

14:29.958 --> 14:30.875
Hey Megan!

14:30.875 --> 14:32.290
What brings you out here?

14:33.833 --> 14:34.750
Hey Megan!

14:34.875 --> 14:36.165
What brings you out here?

14:41.540 --> 14:42.583
Hey Megan!

14:43.625 --> 14:45.915
What are the odds that we'd meet out here in the forest?

14:50.083 --> 14:51.165
Hey Megan!

14:51.333 --> 14:53.750
Oh my gosh! Fancy meeting you here.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.083
Hey Megan!

14:56.750 --> 14:57.625
Megan.

14:58.208 --> 14:58.833
Goodness.

15:01.625 --> 15:02.458
Hey Megan!

15:03.708 --> 15:04.416
Hey Megan!

15:04.583 --> 15:05.375
Hey Megan!

15:05.541 --> 15:05.958
Hey Megan!

15:05.958 --> 15:06.375
Ah!

15:06.625 --> 15:07.166
Hey Megan!

15:07.791 --> 15:09.291
Oh hey! Here, I'll catch up with you.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.458
Hey Megan!

15:13.958 --> 15:16.041
Oh, that's right. You live on this street.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.000
[sighs]

15:17.166 --> 15:19.666
I just happened to be purchasing some organic beets

15:19.666 --> 15:21.875
and decided to walk home instead of polluting --

15:21.875 --> 15:23.583
Danny, this has to stop.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.583
What?

15:25.666 --> 15:27.666
Coming up with excuses to see me.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.041
I really did buy the beets.

15:31.041 --> 15:34.125
Look, I know you have it in your head that this is going to
work somehow

15:34.125 --> 15:36.415
but it's not. It's working against you.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.458
Did I catch you at a bad time?

15:39.708 --> 15:41.083
Listen, I'll just take my beets and go.

15:41.165 --> 15:42.415
No more, Danny. Okay?

15:42.583 --> 15:43.290
I understand.

15:43.540 --> 15:44.040
See you later.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.458
No. Don't see me later.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.625
Okay, not later.

15:46.790 --> 15:47.625
Some other time.

15:47.708 --> 15:49.125
We had Bible Club all year.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.875
Why didn't you say anything then?

15:52.500 --> 15:53.750
You were with Damian.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.875
So you were following the rules?

15:57.665 --> 15:58.708
Here's another one:

15:58.708 --> 16:00.041
Leave me alone.

16:03.458 --> 16:53.833
♬

16:54.665 --> 16:55.750
[phone chimes]

16:57.040 --> 16:58.125
[phone chimes]

16:58.583 --> 17:00.083
Hello, Theresia.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.416
Hey. You don't look ready.

17:02.958 --> 17:04.083
I thought they cancelled.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.750
The first church did but then a different one booked us.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.500
All that time on your phone, I guess none of it was on
email?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.875
Be ready in 10. I'll pick you up.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.500
Where are we, anyway?

17:24.500 --> 17:25.875
Hope Community Church.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.208
Get me out of here. Now.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.916
But they booked us. We have to perform.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.750
This is Megan's church.

17:37.750 --> 17:38.875
Oh.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.000
Well it'll be fine. Just don't make a big deal out of it.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.708
No, you have to go on without me.

17:42.791 --> 17:45.416
No, we don't. Because it's not a big deal. Remember?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500
Beau can be Hambone. You can read the other lines.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.833
You can't just abandon us. This is your program.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.041
She probably won't be here. It's for Jr. High kids.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.958
She works with Jr. High kids!

17:53.958 --> 17:56.166
Then this is your chance to show her you can be cool about
it.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.916
If she sees me she's not gonna be cool about it.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.333
Did you bring the other costumes?

18:02.416 --> 18:03.416
Yeah. Why?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.458
I have to make sure she can't recognize me.

18:08.750 --> 18:14.583
♬

18:15.000 --> 18:16.791
Rock n' roll.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.541
At my show tonight there's gonna be a choir.

18:35.958 --> 18:38.958
A choir of drunk babes!

18:40.333 --> 18:42.291
No. I... I already did that one.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.083
There's gonna be a symphony.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.916
A gang symphony.

18:49.916 --> 18:53.000
That uses violin strings to strangle puppies.

18:53.208 --> 18:58.166
And then they throw the dead puppies at pastors while
they're trying to preach their sermons.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.958
Uh, can I help you?

19:03.833 --> 19:04.833
Hello.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.041
Am I interrupting something?

19:12.541 --> 19:13.625
Okay, then.

19:13.666 --> 19:14.791
Good talk.

19:16.833 --> 19:17.708
Hey.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.833
Don't you recognize me?

19:21.625 --> 19:22.333
No.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.166
Are you sure?

19:25.166 --> 19:27.291
I never forget a face tattoo.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.375
Well good.

19:30.708 --> 19:31.625
Cause uh...

19:32.125 --> 19:33.958
if you recognized me that'd be trouble.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.333
Why?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.250
Cause you'd want an autograph.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.916
And then other people would see and then everyone would want
autographs, and...

19:40.916 --> 19:43.291
that would defeat the whole purpose of me hiding back here.

19:43.625 --> 19:46.000
Well you picked a bad place to hide.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.666
There are like a hundred kids on their way to church here.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.166
Ah, cruel irony.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.125
What were you saying before?

19:53.125 --> 19:55.625
Something about dead puppies?

19:57.083 --> 19:59.083
Oh, well that's just a story I like to tell.

19:59.083 --> 20:03.000
About how I defeated the terrible puppy killing gang.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.541
And you like to tell it alone behind a church?

20:06.750 --> 20:08.125
Well, yeah.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.916
Cause you never know who might hear.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.708
Who are you?

20:16.291 --> 20:17.333
I'm Hambone.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.416
Well, Hambone...

20:21.416 --> 20:22.541
I'm Megan.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.583
So how'd you do it?

20:29.041 --> 20:29.916
Uh, do what?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.541
Defeat the puppy killing gang.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.833
Well I taught the puppies how to fight back.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.000
You know, you're funny.

20:37.416 --> 20:38.666
I bet you're popular at parties.

20:38.666 --> 20:40.083
Oh, I'm the man at parties.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.833
Every year, on my birthday, I have...

20:43.250 --> 20:44.958
a hundred friends over!

20:44.958 --> 20:46.416
It's my favorite day of the year.

20:46.750 --> 20:50.375
They usually spend the first hour thanking me for previous
parties and then we --

20:50.375 --> 20:53.708
Look, I gotta get in there, but I want to hear more.

20:54.666 --> 20:57.416
Maybe if you're around after we could meet up?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.750
Or you could just join us.

20:59.875 --> 21:03.208
It would be nice to finally have someone interesting in
there.

21:04.416 --> 21:07.250
How about instead you and I get out of here?

21:08.708 --> 21:09.625
Right now?

21:09.916 --> 21:10.916
Yeah.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.125
My dad's the pastor. I can't just skip it.

21:13.791 --> 21:14.833
You can if you're with me.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.666
Danny!

21:21.875 --> 21:24.000
We're on in about seven min...

21:26.791 --> 21:28.208
Danny, where you at?

21:28.333 --> 21:31.416
I'm in Pamplona, Spain. Running with the bulls, right?

21:31.708 --> 21:34.666
And one of them comes along that everybody's afraid of.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.750
El Diablo, they called him.

21:37.083 --> 21:38.458
I see him and I just stop.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.833
And I just stand there looking at him.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.250
In the middle of Spain.

21:42.666 --> 21:43.958
When he gets close...

21:44.375 --> 21:46.875
I turn, backflip, and land right on top of him.

21:46.958 --> 21:49.541
He bucks and he bucks but he can't shake me.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.750
The locals cheer and some old timer starts playing me a
song.

21:53.375 --> 21:57.333
And I shout, "Hey man! Toss me that guitar!"

21:57.541 --> 22:00.625
And I compose a song right there on the bull.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.458
When we get to the arena

22:02.458 --> 22:04.541
I play the song and it...

22:04.541 --> 22:06.416
convinces them to let the bulls live.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.041
And to treat animals humanely.

22:10.541 --> 22:13.250
El Diablo wanted to marry me after that, but...

22:13.833 --> 22:16.166
the laws in Spain wouldn't allow it at the time.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.250
That's good. You should tell that one tonight.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.583
Isn't that what I just did?

22:20.583 --> 22:21.666
No, I mean at the party.

22:21.666 --> 22:22.416
Whoa.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.791
You never said anything about a party.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.083
That's cause I wasn't sure if I wanted to bring you yet.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.041
But now I am. You'll be a hit.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.625
I don't want to go to a party.

22:30.958 --> 22:31.916
Why?

22:31.958 --> 22:33.000
You don't seem busy.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.458
What if...

22:34.666 --> 22:36.291
somebody recognizes me?

22:36.625 --> 22:37.500
They won't.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.500
How do you know?

22:38.500 --> 22:39.750
Because you're putting on an act.

22:39.916 --> 22:42.166
I mean whoever you are you've got it buried deep.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.250
I could use that kind of crazy tonight.

22:45.291 --> 22:46.666
Are you calling me a liar?

22:46.791 --> 22:50.000
Anyone named Hambone would never tell anyone his real name.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.125
Now you have a chance to prove you're as bold as you say.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.875
This is not how I want to prove it.

22:54.250 --> 22:55.541
Why? What are you afraid of?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.625
I don't want to hang out with a bunch of people I don't
know.

22:58.958 --> 23:00.083
What's bold about that?

23:00.375 --> 23:01.000
[sighs]

23:01.208 --> 23:01.958
Okay.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.583
It's getting pretty late. I should probably go.

23:06.791 --> 23:07.791
It's like five.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.375
I know. So late.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.375
It was nice knowing you, Hambone.

23:18.291 --> 23:19.041
Hey!

23:20.708 --> 23:23.333
These uh, people at the party. What are they like?

23:23.458 --> 23:24.291
I mean...

23:24.791 --> 23:25.708
Are they cool?

23:25.791 --> 23:26.666
No.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.250
That's why I need you.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.375
All right, then.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.333
Let's party.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
[narrator] I had never seen the house before.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.666
But I knew whose it was.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.666
And I knew why Megan wanted me there.

23:43.000 --> 23:54.041
♬

23:54.041 --> 23:56.583
[party chatter, clanging cans]

24:05.041 --> 24:06.333
Hello, Damian.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.333
You seem surprised to see me.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.166
Did you forget that I was invited to this party?

24:25.250 --> 24:26.500
I suppose I did.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.791
Which you can understand, considering what's happened
between then and now.

24:30.916 --> 24:32.916
You said we should still be friends.

24:32.916 --> 24:36.291
So I thought I'd drop by and wish you luck on the tour.

24:36.791 --> 24:38.416
How friendly of you.

24:41.166 --> 24:42.333
How are you, Todd?

24:43.500 --> 24:44.875
I'm good.

24:45.333 --> 24:46.708
You get that fill worked out?

24:47.375 --> 24:48.250
Yep.

24:50.625 --> 24:51.958
Ready for the road.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.625
Now I haven't met you before

24:56.625 --> 24:59.666
but I recognize you from the pictures he's been posting.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.875
This is Jeannie.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.916
She'll be with us for all sixteen cities.

25:05.625 --> 25:06.875
Lucky you.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.541
I'm Megan.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.041
And how do you two know each other?

25:13.208 --> 25:14.666
Oh come on, Jeannie.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.708
I've told you all about Megan.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.500
Who'd you bring with you?

25:23.291 --> 25:24.666
This is my new friend, Hambone.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.166
Hambone?

25:26.958 --> 25:28.083
Is that your real name?

25:30.375 --> 25:31.500
Real name?

25:32.875 --> 25:34.041
What does that even mean?

25:35.291 --> 25:36.208
Hey.

25:36.208 --> 25:37.541
Don't I know you?

25:38.250 --> 25:39.166
What?

25:39.166 --> 25:41.625
Yeah, didn't we have a class together?

25:41.750 --> 25:43.333
No, I'm not from here.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.166
Todd, if you're watching this, you were right.

25:46.750 --> 25:47.958
It was English.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.166
So where are you from?

25:51.416 --> 25:52.458
Kansas.

25:53.541 --> 25:55.208
The roughest city in the whole state.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.875
But I left when I was twelve cause

25:57.875 --> 26:00.625
after seven years on the streets I had nothing left to
prove.

26:01.375 --> 26:04.125
I didn't know there were any cities like that in Kansas.

26:04.625 --> 26:05.708
What's it called?

26:07.083 --> 26:08.375
Some called it hell.

26:09.916 --> 26:10.958
I called it home.

26:10.958 --> 26:13.208
I meant what's the name of the city?

26:13.833 --> 26:15.125
I'm not gonna tell you.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.625
And why's that?

26:16.625 --> 26:19.250
Because I can't have the people there knowing I'm here.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.625
Understand?

26:20.916 --> 26:22.833
How mysterious!

26:23.958 --> 26:25.333
Where'd you find this idiot?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.916
You're not being very nice, Damian.

26:27.916 --> 26:29.833
I came here to be nice to you.

26:30.083 --> 26:31.875
Of course. Just being nice.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.833
You wouldn't be trying to get back at me.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.583
That wouldn't be very Christian.

26:39.041 --> 26:40.916
You know what that's about, right?

26:41.458 --> 26:42.916
What are you talking about?

26:43.375 --> 26:44.583
[chuckles]

26:46.208 --> 26:50.958
Looks like Megan went out and found herself the only guy at
church with a tattoo

26:50.958 --> 26:53.083
and brought him out to try to make me jealous.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.666
Oh, he is not from church.

26:54.666 --> 26:57.166
She's always complaining, you see...

26:57.708 --> 27:02.041
about how the only people she knows are from church or Bible
Club.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.916
It's convenient...

27:05.666 --> 27:07.291
that today...

27:07.458 --> 27:10.125
the last day before the tour...

27:10.916 --> 27:13.583
she finds herself a bad boy.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.333
You just don't know how to be civil, do you?

27:17.375 --> 27:19.916
If he's such a rebel why's he the only one not drinking?

27:20.500 --> 27:23.125
Looks like my kindness isn't appreciated here.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.541
Let's go.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.916
Running scared.

27:26.458 --> 27:27.791
As usual.

27:27.875 --> 27:31.750
Happens every time she's cut to the quick by the sermonator.

27:31.791 --> 27:32.916
[chuckles]

27:36.250 --> 27:38.666
I could drink you under the table.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.458
What was that?

27:41.458 --> 27:42.625
You heard me.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.208
All right.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.875
Bad idea. He drinks a lot.

27:54.208 --> 27:55.541
Six pack sprint.

27:59.541 --> 28:00.708
Ladies...

28:01.000 --> 28:02.208
you'll referee.

28:11.291 --> 28:13.791
First one to six empty shells wins.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.291
Starting in five...

28:17.083 --> 28:18.125
Four...

28:18.625 --> 28:19.541
Three...

28:20.625 --> 28:21.583
Two...

28:21.583 --> 28:27.875
[screaming]

28:33.333 --> 28:34.500
Uh...

28:34.833 --> 28:35.791
Okay.

28:36.791 --> 28:38.500
First round disqualification.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.916
Beer is for babies.

28:42.750 --> 28:44.083
You want a duel?

28:44.916 --> 28:46.250
Let's do shots.

28:51.125 --> 28:53.208
Shots go down until someone doesn't get up.

28:53.416 --> 28:54.375
Got it?

28:56.416 --> 28:57.833
Is that all you got?

29:01.958 --> 29:03.958
I could drink that for breakfast.

29:04.541 --> 29:06.416
But it will be enough to take you down.

29:11.125 --> 30:21.041
♬

30:22.125 --> 30:24.208
Hey, you can't spit it out.

30:24.208 --> 30:24.916
What?

30:24.916 --> 30:26.833
I saw you spit it on your sleeve.

30:26.833 --> 30:28.000
No, I didn't.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.833
Is that why you got your shirt wet?

30:29.833 --> 30:32.208
You thought you could spit 'em out and it would blend in?

30:32.208 --> 30:34.208
Are you calling me a cheater?

30:34.250 --> 30:35.125
Yeah.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.083
Those are fightin' words.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.416
He can't fight.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.083
He's gotta stay pretty for the tour.

30:41.958 --> 30:43.916
But you knew that, didn't you?

30:45.458 --> 30:47.666
Well if I cheated, like I'm accused,

30:47.708 --> 30:50.041
then I'll have to prove myself some other way.

30:51.916 --> 30:54.500
Pick the game and I'll beat you.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.416
How about a motorcycle race?

31:01.583 --> 31:02.750
On the roof.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.541
Hit her.

31:05.958 --> 31:06.916
What?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.125
Hit her.

31:13.833 --> 31:14.916
No way.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.250
Not her.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.416
Her.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.916
What would that prove?

31:22.583 --> 31:24.583
That you're no choir boy.

31:26.583 --> 31:27.333
Damian --

31:27.333 --> 31:28.416
Don't worry.

31:29.541 --> 31:30.791
He won't do it.

31:30.958 --> 31:32.458
Cause he's scared.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.625
Let's go, Hambone.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.916
This is one of Damian's stupid mind games.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.833
You said you could beat me at any game.

31:39.791 --> 31:40.833
Hit her.

31:41.833 --> 31:42.916
Or you lose.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.625
Hit her and you lose me.

31:44.625 --> 31:45.958
Which he knows you don't want.

31:45.958 --> 31:47.166
No, you won't lose her.

31:47.791 --> 31:48.666
She wants you to do it.

31:48.666 --> 31:49.500
No I don't.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.083
She won't admit it.

31:52.375 --> 31:54.625
But she's been wanting to hit her all night.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.208
Good night, Damian.

32:00.041 --> 32:01.666
A few drinks ago...

32:02.166 --> 32:03.583
I would have just said no.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.333
But that was a few drinks ago.

32:08.666 --> 32:09.916
Hold her steady.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.291
Don't do it, Hambone.

32:12.291 --> 32:26.250
♬

32:26.291 --> 32:26.958
Ow!

32:29.500 --> 32:30.583
You asshole!

32:31.625 --> 32:33.291
Now I'm gonna have a fat lip for the pictures!

32:34.166 --> 32:36.125
It's okay. Maybe it will look tough.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.208
That's not our look!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.166
Get out of here. Both of you.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.166
Did I win?

32:44.166 --> 32:44.958
Get out!

32:44.958 --> 32:45.916
[door opens]

32:51.000 --> 32:52.541
Was that the kind of crazy you wanted?

32:53.250 --> 32:54.166
[laughs]

32:58.750 --> 33:00.333
So you didn't swallow any of it?

33:00.458 --> 33:01.166
No.

33:01.541 --> 33:02.291
I don't drink.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.625
Well how'd you learn to fake it?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.083
My dad's always trying to get me to drink with him.

33:06.083 --> 33:09.541
So I learned that trick to keep him off my back.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.416
Wow, my dad won't even touch the stuff.

33:12.625 --> 33:16.458
Every time there's a beer commercial on TV he goes, "Lies.
All lies."

33:17.125 --> 33:18.708
Well, he's not wrong.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.333
So what's up with you and Damian?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.250
We used to date.

33:24.708 --> 33:25.875
Yeah, well I figured that.

33:26.041 --> 33:28.708
But why would you date someone like him?

33:29.958 --> 33:31.958
It's hard to explain.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.541
I've got time.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.875
Growing up in the church, it's...

33:39.666 --> 33:40.500
different.

33:40.833 --> 33:43.625
There were things I couldn't talk to anyone about, but...

33:44.166 --> 33:45.458
I could talk to him.

33:46.541 --> 33:48.583
You couldn't talk to anyone at church?

33:52.166 --> 33:53.666
You should try another church.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.500
They're all the same.

33:55.791 --> 33:57.750
Everyone is so fake.

33:58.333 --> 34:01.666
It's like we're all in a show playing the role of 'Good
Christian' and...

34:02.500 --> 34:03.833
it's exhausting.

34:05.916 --> 34:07.333
But do you believe it?

34:07.833 --> 34:09.541
God and Jesus and all that?

34:10.375 --> 34:11.291
I don't know.

34:12.041 --> 34:14.375
I mean, I don't want to hurt my family, but...

34:14.375 --> 34:16.250
I don't want to be like them, either.

34:17.708 --> 34:18.916
I want to be real.

34:19.666 --> 34:20.833
You know, like you.

34:21.708 --> 34:22.375
What?

34:22.500 --> 34:24.250
The way you punched Damian.

34:24.541 --> 34:26.625
That is what real people do.

34:27.916 --> 34:29.000
He was right.

34:29.125 --> 34:32.250
About Jeannie. I wanted to hit her, but...

34:33.541 --> 34:35.208
Christians aren't supposed to fight.

34:35.416 --> 34:37.041
Only real people can do that.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.916
So was Damian real?

34:39.250 --> 34:40.291
Oh yeah.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.416
Then why'd you break up?

34:43.375 --> 34:47.625
There was something that he wanted to do that a Christian
girl shouldn't.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.166
He said he wouldn't tour without it.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.833
I said fine, but we'd have to get married first.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.666
And he dumped me.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.250
I should have punched him harder.

35:04.666 --> 35:05.708
[phone chimes]

35:07.916 --> 35:09.291
[phone chimes]

35:12.250 --> 35:13.208
What is it?

35:14.250 --> 35:15.625
Damian posted something.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.375
A picture.

35:17.750 --> 35:20.125
Of me, but it's fake.

35:21.833 --> 35:24.708
That is my face but that is not my body.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.750
Forget it.

35:25.750 --> 35:26.791
The Internet's garbage.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.458
I know. That's why I always tried to make sure that
something like this didn't happen.

35:30.458 --> 35:33.166
I didn't want any scandal and Damian knows it.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.708
Well it doesn't seem like something church people would see.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.000
You don't know them.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.041
They'll see it and they'll tell my dad.

35:40.125 --> 35:42.708
And each other. They'll tell everyone except for me.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.083
Well then tell them it's not you.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.916
It's too good of a photo edit to convince them of that.

35:46.916 --> 35:48.791
Then Damian has to say it's not you.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.041
How would we get him to do that?

35:53.375 --> 35:54.750
I have no idea.

35:56.041 --> 35:58.791
Well you came up with something easy enough back there.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.666
Can't you just think of something else?

36:04.166 --> 36:05.083
What?

36:05.750 --> 36:06.666
Nothing.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.208
You're smiling. What is it?

36:09.291 --> 36:10.666
It's something we shouldn't do.

36:10.791 --> 36:12.500
I'll be the judge of that.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.041
So... their van's packed for the tour, right?

36:17.666 --> 36:19.583
But if it went missing...

36:20.250 --> 36:21.375
You want to steal the van?

36:21.375 --> 36:22.875
No. I do not.

36:23.541 --> 36:25.083
But that's the idea.

36:25.083 --> 36:28.625
And then we wouldn't tell him where it was until he admitted
the picture was doctored.

36:29.416 --> 36:30.416
Let's do it.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.083
No, you're not thinking this through.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.166
What did I miss?

36:33.333 --> 36:36.208
With everything that's happened tonight, you'd be the first
suspect.

36:36.208 --> 36:37.458
No, you would.

36:37.750 --> 36:42.333
That's why you'll do the illegal part and then when they ask
me about you I'll just tell them the truth.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.125
I have no idea who you are.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.208
Hey Jeannie.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.125
[Jeannie] What?

36:52.708 --> 36:54.541
[Damian] Which one of our songs...

36:54.833 --> 36:57.833
would most likely make girls want to take their tops off?

36:58.416 --> 36:59.500
[Jeannie] I don't know.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.708
[Damian] If you had to choose just one.

37:02.416 --> 37:05.416
[Jeannie] I didn't know there were multiple songs. I just
thought it was one long one.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.208
[Damian] Come on.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.000
We gotta know which song to play first.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.125
[key clinks]

37:36.750 --> 37:37.625
[click]

37:59.666 --> 38:00.916
[Damian] Hey Jeannie!

38:02.000 --> 38:02.708
What?

38:03.833 --> 38:05.250
[Damian] What are you doing?

38:08.166 --> 38:09.708
Opening the windows.

38:09.916 --> 38:11.250
It stinks in here.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.833
Girl's don't like that.

38:18.666 --> 38:19.125
[slaps]

38:33.333 --> 38:33.875
Boo!

38:33.875 --> 38:34.541
[screams]

38:34.541 --> 38:35.208
[laughs]

38:35.875 --> 38:37.000
I thought you were...

38:37.375 --> 38:38.000
[clears throat]

38:39.916 --> 38:41.541
I thought you were gonna meet me at the park.

38:41.708 --> 38:44.666
I decided if you're not afraid to get in trouble, I
shouldn't be either.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.375
You inspire me.

38:50.708 --> 38:51.916
[engine starts]

38:51.916 --> 39:23.750
♬

39:24.291 --> 39:27.291
Well this has been an enjoyable evening.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.541
For sure.

39:30.375 --> 39:31.916
Damian never fought for me.

39:32.666 --> 39:33.958
Only with me.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.291
This is a whole new world.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.125
Well, I'm happy to do it.

39:38.791 --> 39:39.750
Anytime.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.375
Let me give you my number.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.958
I don't have a phone.

39:44.666 --> 39:46.125
What? Everyone has a phone.

39:46.291 --> 39:47.250
Not me.

39:47.666 --> 39:48.583
Why?

39:49.541 --> 39:52.125
I couldn't risk it falling into the wrong hands.

39:52.750 --> 39:56.333
Anyway, let's just do like they did in the old days and...

39:56.791 --> 39:58.791
make a plan to see each other again.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.458
All right. What's the plan?

40:02.791 --> 40:04.750
Five PM tomorrow night at the park?

40:05.458 --> 40:06.791
It's a date.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.208
Well...

40:09.541 --> 40:10.708
see you then.

40:12.041 --> 40:12.875
Hey.

40:14.125 --> 40:14.916
Is that it?

40:16.416 --> 40:17.458
What do you mean?

40:17.833 --> 40:19.083
Are you just gonna go?

40:20.250 --> 40:22.041
Well I think we've said all we should say.

40:22.041 --> 40:25.625
But have we done all we should do?

40:28.416 --> 40:29.291
Well I think so.

40:29.291 --> 40:30.375
Drop the act.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.333
Well...

40:33.333 --> 40:34.291
Megan...

40:34.291 --> 40:36.041
[kissing]

40:39.500 --> 40:40.833
Good night, Hambone.

40:45.250 --> 40:48.041
[narrator] I kissed Megan Hendrickson.

40:48.708 --> 40:50.250
A dream come true.

40:50.541 --> 40:53.375
I don't remember walking home. I just remember how I felt.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.458
It was the greatest sensation I'd ever had

40:56.541 --> 40:57.916
and nothing else mattered.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.333
It didn't matter that she didn't know it was me.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.500
Because, after all, it was me.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.791
And it didn't matter what I had to do to get there.

41:05.916 --> 41:07.375
I skipped drama. So what?

41:07.375 --> 41:09.125
I punched Damian. He'll live.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.875
I stole a van.

41:12.875 --> 41:14.041
Wait a minute.

41:15.875 --> 41:16.875
I stole a van.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.583
I could get in huge trouble for that.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.208
But it wasn't me. It was Hambone.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.250
Could Hambone get in trouble if he doesn't exist?

41:25.791 --> 41:27.166
Hambone had my fingerprints.

41:28.291 --> 41:29.041
Oh crap.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.375
If I got caught I'd go to jail.

41:31.750 --> 41:35.083
And get fired from the church and never work in ministry
again.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.083
I had to fix this.

41:37.125 --> 41:38.458
♬

41:38.458 --> 41:40.791
The police would be looking for someone with a face tattoo.

41:40.791 --> 41:43.500
So I had to unsteal the van as myself.

41:48.333 --> 41:51.625
I knew if I got caught I'd have to explain why I was driving
a stolen van.

41:52.333 --> 41:54.083
To the police and to Megan.

41:54.833 --> 41:56.125
But I couldn't think of anything.

41:56.375 --> 41:59.375
Somehow when I was Hambone the stories just rolled off my
tongue.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.375
But for Danny Doom, nothing came to mind.

42:03.166 --> 42:06.750
But I also knew no one would call the police if I returned
the van before the band woke up.

42:07.416 --> 42:09.958
With all the drinking they did, I thought I would have until
noon.

42:12.541 --> 42:13.833
But there they were.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.250
What?!

42:18.333 --> 42:22.083
The van was here the whole time. You woke us up for nothing,
Jeannie.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.875
No, it was stolen. Remember?

42:25.416 --> 42:26.208
Yeah.

42:26.208 --> 42:29.041
That's why we were out looking for it all morning.

42:30.458 --> 42:31.625
Hey guys.

42:33.208 --> 42:34.833
I found your van!

42:35.416 --> 42:36.666
Why'd you take it?

42:36.791 --> 42:40.000
Uh, I didn't take it. I just...

42:40.875 --> 42:41.750
found it.

42:41.750 --> 42:42.875
Out in the woods.

42:42.875 --> 42:46.583
Where you just happened to be at the butt-crack of dawn?

42:47.375 --> 42:48.750
Yeah, I uh...

42:49.208 --> 42:51.791
I like to take walks in the woods early.

42:52.666 --> 42:54.416
Before it gets crowded.

42:54.916 --> 42:57.875
How'd you know it was ours? Magic?

43:00.666 --> 43:03.750
Well I knew you guys were leaving on tour today and I saw
the band gear

43:03.750 --> 43:05.916
and put two and two together.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.000
You know our band?

43:08.458 --> 43:09.750
Yeah. I follow you.

43:10.375 --> 43:11.250
Online.

43:11.416 --> 43:12.208
Whoa.

43:13.083 --> 43:14.250
We're famous.

43:14.250 --> 43:15.375
No you're not.

43:15.583 --> 43:17.708
You followed him, didn't you?

43:18.125 --> 43:18.875
Who?

43:19.041 --> 43:20.500
Megan's new boyfriend.

43:20.500 --> 43:21.750
The one who stole the van.

43:21.875 --> 43:23.125
He stole the van.

43:23.541 --> 43:25.375
Does he look like a van thief to you?

43:26.166 --> 43:27.875
How do you know the other guy took it?

43:28.916 --> 43:32.333
Because he's the type who gets mad when you insult his girl.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.458
And this is the type that wishes he was that type.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.208
Look...

43:36.208 --> 43:38.666
the van's back so everything's fine now.

43:38.916 --> 43:40.208
I'm just gonna go.

43:41.750 --> 43:43.458
Are you one of Megan's boy toys?

43:44.583 --> 43:46.041
I know Megan.

43:46.125 --> 43:47.083
How?

43:47.916 --> 43:49.791
We were in a club together at school.

43:50.541 --> 43:51.916
I've heard of this club.

43:52.291 --> 43:54.541
It's where everyone's drooling in their Bible's over her.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.583
I wouldn't say that.

43:57.291 --> 43:58.666
Did she put you up to this?

44:01.416 --> 44:03.041
Why would she do that?

44:03.583 --> 44:05.625
Because that's how she is.

44:06.458 --> 44:10.500
She'll joyride all night with the bad boy. But in the
morning...

44:10.500 --> 44:11.791
comes regret.

44:12.041 --> 44:14.875
So she confesses to 'friend-zone-Freddie' over here.

44:15.166 --> 44:16.583
Who takes the bait.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.333
And offers to fix it for her.

44:20.208 --> 44:22.208
She never could decide who she wants to be.

44:23.791 --> 44:24.666
Oh well.

44:25.541 --> 44:27.083
She's someone else's problem now.

44:27.083 --> 44:28.541
So what about him?

44:32.875 --> 44:34.208
Forget him.

44:34.833 --> 44:37.208
Pining for Megan's torture enough.

44:40.916 --> 44:41.750
Hey!

44:43.750 --> 44:46.916
If she helped steal the van, like you say, then...

44:46.916 --> 44:49.000
she had you in a bad spot, don't you think?

44:49.750 --> 44:55.166
I mean she could have demanded you take that picture down
before you got the van back but she didn't.

44:55.500 --> 44:56.875
Bad move for her.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.416
To show you kindness?

44:59.583 --> 45:01.791
Bad move for you to not show any back.

45:02.791 --> 45:04.833
What are you gonna do about it, Freddie?

45:07.416 --> 45:09.583
Remind you of your guilt-stained conscience.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.083
That you ruined a nice girl's life...

45:14.250 --> 45:16.291
just because she wouldn't sleep with you.

45:22.708 --> 45:23.625
All right.

45:23.791 --> 45:24.875
Fine.

45:26.750 --> 45:28.791
Tell her that thing's gonna go away.

45:29.208 --> 45:31.250
And tell her to make up her mind.

45:34.583 --> 45:36.458
[narrator] He took the picture down after that.

45:36.750 --> 45:40.125
Said it was all a joke and made fun of those who thought it
was really her.

45:40.458 --> 45:42.375
Everyone said, "Good move, Damian!"

45:42.500 --> 45:44.083
But he didn't save the day.

45:44.083 --> 45:45.125
I did.

45:45.125 --> 45:46.375
Danny Do.

45:46.666 --> 45:47.958
But no one knew.

45:48.958 --> 45:49.666
[knocks]

45:49.708 --> 45:50.625
Howdy, Danny.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.833
Hey, Pastor.

45:53.833 --> 45:54.916
So...

45:55.541 --> 45:57.000
how do you like your new office?

45:57.625 --> 45:58.666
Is that what this is?

45:58.666 --> 45:59.083
[chuckles]

45:59.083 --> 46:01.958
Well, believe it or not, my first office was worse than this
one.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.166
Say, um...

46:07.041 --> 46:08.416
what happened last night?

46:10.791 --> 46:12.000
What do you mean?

46:13.583 --> 46:16.250
The drama team said you left before the performance.

46:16.875 --> 46:17.750
Oh... that.

46:17.750 --> 46:19.250
Yeah, um...

46:20.416 --> 46:24.333
there was a situation and I couldn't go on.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.958
The church was quite disappointed.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.333
It won't happen again.

46:29.583 --> 46:30.583
All right.

46:34.125 --> 46:38.500
So if you didn't do the drama, you must have had some extra
time on your hands.

46:40.291 --> 46:41.125
Yeah.

46:42.625 --> 46:44.333
Care to share how you filled it?

46:47.541 --> 46:51.541
If there's something specific you want to ask me, Pastor,
feel free.

46:52.708 --> 46:54.333
I thought it would be obvious.

46:55.125 --> 46:56.833
Not until you tell me.

46:57.750 --> 46:58.458
Okay.

47:00.458 --> 47:05.666
I'd like to know why there's a picture of you on the
Internet with a stolen van.

47:09.166 --> 47:10.500
I didn't know that.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.375
Everybody's been posting it.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.166
What happened?

47:19.291 --> 47:21.333
Danny, we need to talk about this.

47:21.333 --> 47:24.333
I'd rather not. Just do whatever you have to do.

47:25.041 --> 47:28.041
What I have to do is get the full story.

47:28.666 --> 47:33.625
After all, it's not every day someone on my staff turns out
to be...

47:34.166 --> 47:35.583
a hero.

47:36.041 --> 47:39.875
If you hadn't found that van that band's whole tour would
have been ruined.

47:40.541 --> 47:41.791
Did you know that?

47:43.291 --> 47:45.583
Just look at what they said about you.

47:45.916 --> 47:49.708
"Last night, van and gear were stolen by some ass..."

47:50.291 --> 47:51.208
Mean person.

47:51.833 --> 47:54.791
"Who tried to ruin the tour.

47:54.791 --> 47:58.583
But day was saved when Freddie here found and returned the
van."

47:58.958 --> 48:00.208
Why do they call you 'Freddie'?

48:01.000 --> 48:04.250
That's just a friendly nickname they gave me.

48:04.958 --> 48:05.875
Hm.

48:05.875 --> 48:08.250
"Now we're loaded and on our way to Portland.

48:08.250 --> 48:10.916
and that sack of... can suck..."

48:10.916 --> 48:13.916
The rest is just their opinion of the person who stole the
van.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.750
So how'd you find it?

48:18.166 --> 48:20.250
It just sort of... happened.

48:22.000 --> 48:22.958
How?

48:23.416 --> 48:26.125
I was walking through the woods and there it was.

48:26.791 --> 48:28.958
Since when do you go walking in the woods?

48:29.625 --> 48:31.333
Since this morning.

48:31.333 --> 48:32.916
Well what inspired that?

48:38.875 --> 48:40.166
God.

48:41.708 --> 48:42.833
Really?

48:42.833 --> 48:46.583
Yeah. Oh yeah, it was all God.

48:46.791 --> 48:49.208
Why not just come out and say it?

48:49.208 --> 48:51.208
This isn't something to be shy about.

48:51.208 --> 48:54.166
I guess I just didn't want to say too much because...

48:54.166 --> 48:56.666
I didn't want people thinking that I stole the van.

48:56.666 --> 48:57.916
You? Steal a van?

48:57.916 --> 48:58.583
[laughs]

48:58.583 --> 49:00.791
You don't have to worry about anyone thinking that.

49:01.208 --> 49:05.666
But you do have to worry about the attention you'll get when
I tell everyone this was you.

49:05.666 --> 49:07.166
You don't have to do that.

49:07.166 --> 49:09.708
Giving glory to God instead of taking the credit.

49:09.708 --> 49:13.250
That's exactly the kind of unselfishness I've been talking
about.

49:13.583 --> 49:14.833
Attaway, Danny Do.

49:14.833 --> 49:17.916
So, like you said, I probably shouldn't get any credit.

49:17.916 --> 49:21.958
And that humility is what convinced me you can handle it.

49:23.250 --> 49:27.041
People pay far more attention to what you do than what you
say.

49:27.416 --> 49:32.083
This act of kindness could lead more to the Lord than a
thousand church dramas.

49:33.041 --> 49:35.208
Cause it's not just a story.

49:36.458 --> 49:37.833
It's real.

49:43.083 --> 49:45.041
Hey Danny, right? From church?

49:45.041 --> 49:46.791
That was awesome what you did!

49:46.791 --> 49:48.833
It's nice seeing a young person doing the right thing.

49:48.833 --> 49:51.500
[narrator] The attention made me extremely uncomfortable.

49:51.708 --> 49:52.541
Oh hey, Danny!

49:52.541 --> 49:53.708
We heard about the van.

49:53.708 --> 49:54.458
Ah, it was nothing.

49:54.458 --> 49:55.375
[narrator] At first.

49:55.375 --> 49:56.625
I just found it out in the woods.

49:56.625 --> 49:57.250
That's amazing.

49:57.250 --> 49:58.583
[narrator] But then it grew on me.

49:58.583 --> 49:59.458
Thank you.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.875
We've been hearing about you at church!

50:00.875 --> 50:03.500
[narrator] I started to see why popularity was so popular.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.250
That's so nice of you.

50:04.250 --> 50:05.041
Well thank you guys.

50:05.041 --> 50:05.875
[narrator] It felt good.

50:05.875 --> 50:07.125
Hey guys! That's Danny!

50:07.125 --> 50:08.333
Are you serious? Danny!

50:08.333 --> 50:10.333
And there was this big light that came down...

50:10.333 --> 50:12.458
And it's the day of their tour, you guys.

50:12.458 --> 50:13.166
No way!

50:13.166 --> 50:14.458
And why shouldn't I be popular?

50:14.875 --> 50:17.375
I did a good thing. I brought the van back.

50:17.958 --> 50:19.500
Who cares how it was stolen?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.958
[narrator] I heard from everyone I knew that day.

50:22.666 --> 50:24.458
Except the one I wanted to hear from most.

50:25.166 --> 50:27.375
She didn't comment or like any of the posts.

50:27.583 --> 50:28.791
And I checked them all.

50:29.583 --> 50:31.166
Couldn't she see what was happening here?

50:31.166 --> 50:33.500
And wasn't she happy that Damian took the picture down?

50:33.500 --> 50:35.583
And that it was all resolved peacefully?

50:35.750 --> 50:36.583
By me?

50:36.791 --> 50:38.208
Did she know about that?

50:38.916 --> 50:40.000
I had to find out.

50:41.208 --> 50:42.041
Hey Megan.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.291
Did you hear the news?

50:47.875 --> 50:50.083
I found Damian's van and brought it back.

50:50.333 --> 50:51.875
And he took down that picture.

50:54.291 --> 50:55.541
So everything's good now.

50:58.291 --> 51:00.458
There's been a lot of chatter online about it.

51:03.333 --> 51:04.291
Isn't that great?

51:04.541 --> 51:06.291
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

51:06.625 --> 51:08.791
I know. I um... I just...

51:10.041 --> 51:11.875
thought this would be news you would want to hear.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.791
I already heard that news and it was not what I wanted to
hear.

51:14.875 --> 51:16.583
But I got him to take down the picture.

51:16.583 --> 51:18.958
I didn't ask you to do that. I asked you to leave me alone.

51:19.750 --> 51:20.333
But --

51:20.333 --> 51:21.583
Goodbye.

51:23.916 --> 51:26.375
[narrator] How could she love Hambone and hate Danny?

51:26.958 --> 51:28.458
Couldn't she see Danny was cool?

51:29.166 --> 51:31.125
Maybe not before, but he was now.

51:31.666 --> 51:33.916
Everyone else saw it. Why not her?

51:34.666 --> 51:35.958
Something had to be done.

51:36.458 --> 51:39.083
Hambone was going to see Megan with one thing on his mind.

51:39.416 --> 51:41.375
Convince her Danny is cool.

51:42.750 --> 51:43.375
Hey.

51:44.083 --> 51:44.833
Take it easy.

51:44.833 --> 51:46.583
[narrator] Okay, maybe two things on his mind.

51:46.750 --> 51:48.458
But we kissed last night, so...

51:48.791 --> 51:50.875
You're acting like that was your first time.

51:51.875 --> 51:53.375
You made me feel like it was.

51:54.666 --> 51:58.125
But anyway, I saw Damian took that picture down.

51:58.333 --> 51:59.958
I thought you didn't have a phone.

52:00.708 --> 52:01.500
I stole one.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.500
A glance at one. Anyway,

52:03.666 --> 52:05.916
I guess we should return his van now, right?

52:06.208 --> 52:07.375
Someone already did.

52:07.875 --> 52:08.416
What?

52:08.500 --> 52:09.916
Did you tell anyone where we hid it?

52:10.083 --> 52:10.666
No.

52:11.416 --> 52:12.541
Well some guy found it.

52:13.125 --> 52:14.083
He ruined everything.

52:14.458 --> 52:16.583
But Damian still took the picture down?

52:16.708 --> 52:19.083
Yeah. He talked him in to it somehow.

52:19.541 --> 52:21.291
Then I guess we should thank him.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.500
For meddling?

52:23.333 --> 52:27.333
For de-escalating the situation and still getting everyone
what they wanted.

52:27.708 --> 52:29.166
He sounds pretty cool to me.

52:29.458 --> 52:32.791
I didn't want Damian to back down. I wanted to fight him and
win.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.541
Now I can't.

52:35.708 --> 52:36.875
But you can't lose, either.

52:37.625 --> 52:39.000
What did this guy say to Damian?

52:39.416 --> 52:40.416
What's it matter?

52:40.708 --> 52:44.125
It must have been something pretty compelling to get him to
throw in the towel like that.

52:45.208 --> 52:46.375
I guess he spooked him.

52:46.750 --> 52:48.708
He does have that effect on people.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.250
Come on. You gotta give this guy a little credit.

52:51.416 --> 52:53.000
You sound like you want to meet him.

52:53.375 --> 52:54.208
Nah.

52:54.458 --> 52:56.125
I can admire from afar.

52:56.291 --> 52:57.958
Well, you might meet him anyway.

52:58.083 --> 52:59.666
He's been following me.

52:59.958 --> 53:02.000
He could be here right now for all I know.

53:05.291 --> 53:09.708
Neither of us told anyone where the van was so the only way
that he could have known is if he followed us.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.333
Couldn't he have just found it out in the woods?

53:12.333 --> 53:14.916
I'd believe that if he hadn't already been following me.

53:14.916 --> 53:16.166
What's wrong with that?

53:16.500 --> 53:17.416
I mean...

53:17.416 --> 53:18.375
I follow you.

53:18.375 --> 53:21.375
Yeah, but that's different. This guy he's like obsessed.

53:21.375 --> 53:23.916
So he really, really likes you.

53:24.291 --> 53:26.791
Don't you think someone should really, really like you?

53:26.791 --> 53:28.000
Not like this.

53:28.166 --> 53:30.416
He's like some kid brother who doesn't know how annoying he
is.

53:30.416 --> 53:32.791
Who does annoying things like save your reputation?

53:32.791 --> 53:34.458
Which he did purely out of self-interest.

53:34.458 --> 53:35.041
How do you know?

53:35.041 --> 53:37.791
Because he showed up at my doorstep to tell me about it.

53:37.791 --> 53:41.791
And that's not all. He told everyone that God led him to the
van.

53:41.916 --> 53:44.000
And of course all the crazy Christians believed him.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.625
So now he's their hero when all he did was stalk me.

53:48.833 --> 53:50.166
It's pathetic.

53:55.083 --> 53:56.708
So, um...

53:57.916 --> 53:59.750
What should he have done instead?

54:00.583 --> 54:01.500
Nothing.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.958
Left me alone.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.125
But he just keeps coming back.

54:08.833 --> 54:11.500
He probably thinks God wants us to be together somehow.

54:14.708 --> 54:15.958
Crazy.

54:18.625 --> 54:20.083
How do you know it's not true?

54:21.708 --> 54:22.958
Why are you defending him?

54:22.958 --> 54:26.458
You said you weren't sure what you believe so how are you
sure about this?

54:26.666 --> 54:29.000
Are you worried he's gonna steal me away from you?

54:30.083 --> 54:31.041
Don't be.

54:31.583 --> 54:34.291
I know what I believe about who I want to spend my time
with.

54:36.250 --> 54:40.333
Look, thinking about him gives me the creeps. Can we talk
about something else?

54:40.833 --> 54:41.791
Fine by me.

54:42.541 --> 54:43.916
What do you want to do tonight?

54:44.625 --> 54:45.916
I didn't plan anything.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.583
That seemed to work pretty well last time.

54:48.750 --> 54:51.208
Got any more ex-boyfriend's for me to deal with?

54:52.666 --> 54:53.708
No...

54:54.958 --> 54:56.666
But you should talk to Danny.

54:58.250 --> 54:59.083
Who's Danny?

54:59.083 --> 55:00.958
The guy I've been talking about.

55:01.375 --> 55:04.125
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about him
anymore.

55:04.416 --> 55:07.625
I don't, but... you can help me get rid of him.

55:08.500 --> 55:09.416
How?

55:10.291 --> 55:11.250
Confront him.

55:13.458 --> 55:15.500
This is your business. Not mine.

55:15.500 --> 55:17.000
That didn't stop you last night.

55:17.166 --> 55:18.625
Come on, think of all the fun we had.

55:18.625 --> 55:19.916
Why can't you just talk to him?

55:19.916 --> 55:21.083
I have. He won't listen.

55:21.083 --> 55:22.916
Well then it doesn't seem like he'll listen to me.

55:22.916 --> 55:25.166
Oh he will. Because you'll beat him up if he doesn't.

55:25.166 --> 55:27.583
Well it doesn't seem like he's done anything to deserve
that.

55:27.583 --> 55:30.000
You don't know him, and I'm telling you he deserves it.

55:30.000 --> 55:30.708
Why?

55:30.708 --> 55:32.916
Because he can't just do whatever he wants.

55:32.916 --> 55:34.875
I get to decide who I want to be with.

55:34.875 --> 55:37.625
Not him. Not my dad. Not anybody but me.

55:37.833 --> 55:40.083
He doesn't seem to understand that.

55:44.750 --> 55:45.833
And you want me to talk to him?

55:45.958 --> 55:46.708
Yes.

55:47.041 --> 55:49.500
Because it would put me in a fantastic mood.

55:52.750 --> 55:53.958
[knocks]

56:00.583 --> 56:01.791
[knocks]

56:06.625 --> 56:08.416
[knocks]

56:10.750 --> 56:12.041
Well, looks like he's not home.

56:12.208 --> 56:13.208
Then we wait.

56:13.833 --> 56:15.708
You want to just stand here waiting for him?

56:16.166 --> 56:16.958
Yep.

56:18.166 --> 56:19.583
That doesn't sound like fun.

56:20.125 --> 56:22.208
The look on his face will be worth it.

56:26.708 --> 56:27.833
Maybe he's scared already.

56:28.958 --> 56:30.166
He could be hiding in there.

56:31.666 --> 56:32.583
Hello?

56:32.583 --> 56:33.458
What are you doing?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.000
Anybody home?

56:35.541 --> 56:36.666
You can't just go in.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.958
Come on out, Danny. We just want to talk to you.

56:42.125 --> 56:42.458
[claps]

56:42.458 --> 56:43.041
Hey!

56:43.041 --> 56:44.458
We shouldn't be in here.

56:44.458 --> 56:46.250
What are you so afraid of?

56:53.750 --> 56:55.208
Looks like this is his room.

56:56.375 --> 56:57.666
Is it how you pictured it?

56:57.666 --> 56:59.291
I hadn't pictured it.

57:00.791 --> 57:04.416
The way you described him I thought we'd see some psycho
stuff, but...

57:04.958 --> 57:06.791
He seems pretty normal.

57:09.625 --> 57:12.625
Looks like he's been doing some pretty serious Bible study.

57:13.250 --> 57:15.916
Yeah, he loves to show off how much he knows about the
Bible.

57:15.916 --> 57:17.083
That's a bad thing?

57:17.416 --> 57:18.666
Knowing the Bible?

57:19.416 --> 57:21.333
I'm just trying to understand your world.

57:21.583 --> 57:22.666
Don't forget why we're here.

57:22.666 --> 57:25.666
I know. But I might as well get to know him a little better.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.125
Why? So you and him can be buddies?

57:28.125 --> 57:30.041
♬ "Oh... this American Dream..."

57:30.041 --> 57:31.958
He does have good taste in music.

57:31.958 --> 57:34.083
Trust me, you and him have nothing in common.

57:34.083 --> 57:34.875
[clicks]

57:39.333 --> 57:41.000
Are you sure you want to do this?

57:41.041 --> 57:43.125
Yes. Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

57:43.208 --> 57:45.875
What if there's complications?

57:45.875 --> 57:46.875
Like?

57:47.041 --> 57:48.333
What if he tries to fight me?

57:48.333 --> 57:50.875
[laughs] Yeah, right. He'd never do that.

57:50.875 --> 57:51.958
Won't he be mad?

57:51.958 --> 57:53.750
Yeah, but he's weak.

57:57.750 --> 57:59.166
Looks like he works out.

57:59.166 --> 58:01.666
Even if he had the arms, he does not have the guts.

58:01.708 --> 58:03.250
How do you know all this about him?

58:03.250 --> 58:05.166
Because church boys are all the same.

58:08.208 --> 58:11.083
Look, I don't want to hang out in his room. Let's go back
outside.

58:11.083 --> 58:11.583
Why?

58:11.583 --> 58:12.958
Because this is weird.

58:13.208 --> 58:15.875
Are you uncomfortable because we're breaking the rules?

58:16.041 --> 58:17.958
If you care to join me, I will be outside.

58:20.208 --> 58:21.958
Okay, okay. Fine.

58:23.541 --> 58:24.291
Thank you.

58:26.208 --> 58:26.833
Hey.

58:28.041 --> 58:29.541
Looks like he left his phone.

58:32.375 --> 58:33.791
We could record a message.

58:35.041 --> 58:36.916
We'd have to make sure he sees it.

58:37.500 --> 58:39.875
He seems like the kind of guy who checks his phone a lot.

58:41.583 --> 58:45.083
What's up, Danny? You don't know me, but I know you.

58:45.416 --> 58:47.333
I'm getting to know you real well here in your room.

58:48.166 --> 58:50.041
You know who's never gonna be in your room?

58:50.625 --> 58:51.500
Megan.

58:51.708 --> 58:54.208
Because she doesn't want to be with you, understand?

58:54.666 --> 58:56.791
She thinks you're a joke.

58:57.083 --> 58:59.250
So if you don't leave her alone, you're gonna get hurt.

58:59.625 --> 59:00.500
By me.

59:01.541 --> 59:02.708
Tomorrow night.

59:03.291 --> 59:05.583
Because I'm challenging you to a fight.

59:05.833 --> 59:09.125
Five PM. At the park. Be there.

59:09.500 --> 59:10.833
If you're not afraid.

59:11.750 --> 59:12.625
What was that?

59:12.625 --> 59:14.250
♬

59:14.250 --> 59:15.416
[narrator] The plan was simple.

59:15.708 --> 59:17.000
Danny shows up for the fight.

59:17.208 --> 59:18.125
Hambone doesn't.

59:18.666 --> 59:19.625
Danny wins.

59:19.833 --> 59:22.875
When you insult someone like that you have to give him a
chance to fight back.

59:22.875 --> 59:24.208
It's the right thing to do.

59:24.208 --> 59:26.916
Well that's not what I wanted you to do. Let's do it again
without that part.

59:26.916 --> 59:27.791
No.

59:27.791 --> 59:31.125
If he's as weak as you say what do you have to be worried
about?

59:37.250 --> 59:38.291
What are you doing?

59:38.666 --> 59:41.166
Texting it to him. Making sure he sees it.

59:41.875 --> 59:42.416
Oh.

59:43.583 --> 59:47.416
Well make sure it goes to just him cause I don't want my
face on the Internet.

59:48.583 --> 59:52.875
You were supposed to get rid of him. Not challenge him. Do
you want him to fight you?

59:52.875 --> 59:54.291
It'd be an interesting twist.

59:54.375 --> 59:56.666
Yeah, especially since you seem to like him so much.

59:56.791 --> 59:57.333
Look.

59:58.375 --> 1:00:00.291
The things you say about him...

1:00:01.750 --> 1:00:04.166
there was a time when people talked about me like that.

1:00:05.291 --> 1:00:06.750
When I found out...

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:09.000
it sucked.

1:00:10.166 --> 1:00:12.166
So I don't like doing that to someone else.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.375
But was it true? What they said?

1:00:16.791 --> 1:00:17.541
No.

1:00:21.416 --> 1:00:23.708
There was a side of me that they hadn't seen yet.

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:26.541
I hadn't seen it either until it happened.

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:31.041
Well I'm glad you've changed but Danny hasn't.

1:00:35.458 --> 1:00:36.250
I should go.

1:00:37.208 --> 1:00:38.208
I gotta...

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:40.166
get ready for the fight.

1:00:41.291 --> 1:00:42.291
Are you afraid?

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:45.250
Maybe.

1:00:46.166 --> 1:00:47.875
He could be tougher than he seems.

1:00:47.875 --> 1:00:49.208
Not of him, of me.

1:00:50.333 --> 1:00:51.916
Learning about who you really are.

1:00:53.458 --> 1:00:54.666
You can talk to me.

1:00:55.791 --> 1:00:57.625
Because I'm not afraid.

1:00:58.666 --> 1:01:01.166
There's nothing that you could say that would scare me away
now.

1:01:04.916 --> 1:01:06.458
You don't know what you're saying.

1:01:07.916 --> 1:01:08.875
I gotta go.

1:01:09.875 --> 1:01:11.416
My mind's on the fight tomorrow.

1:01:12.666 --> 1:01:13.541
See you there?

1:01:15.041 --> 1:01:15.666
Yeah.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:17.375
Yeah, I'll be there.

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:20.875
Hey.

1:01:23.083 --> 1:01:25.083
Don't I get another goodnight kiss?

1:01:27.333 --> 1:01:29.041
You're acting like that was your first time.

1:01:30.583 --> 1:01:37.083
♬

1:01:40.250 --> 1:01:41.416
Goodbye, Hambone.

1:01:42.291 --> 1:01:43.666
I wish I never was you.

1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:48.333

1:01:49.541 --> 1:01:50.083
[phone blips]

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:51.541
What's up, Beau?

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:52.500
Are you gonna do it?

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:53.875
Do what?

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:57.458
You totally shouldn't. It's not what we're supposed to do.
But it would be cool if you did!

1:01:57.458 --> 1:01:58.458
Are you gonna?

1:01:58.458 --> 1:01:59.416
Gonna what?

1:01:59.416 --> 1:02:00.541
Fight that guy.

1:02:00.833 --> 1:02:03.833
The one who wants to fight you over Megan. Didn't you see
the video?

1:02:04.958 --> 1:02:07.125
You might get a few punches in. You lift weights, right?

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:11.958
[narrator] In an hour the video that was supposed to go to
just me had been seen by everyone.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:13.708
She posted it.

1:02:13.916 --> 1:02:38.458
♬

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.166
Hey there, Danny Do.

1:02:40.833 --> 1:02:41.708
Hey, Pastor.

1:02:42.833 --> 1:02:45.291
Looks like everyone's talking about you again.

1:02:47.208 --> 1:02:48.375
So...

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.041
How are you feeling about it?

1:02:50.958 --> 1:02:51.833
Fine.

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.791
That guy said some mean things.

1:02:57.708 --> 1:02:59.500
I hope you're not taking it to heart.

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:04.416
He's kind of hard to ignore.

1:03:04.583 --> 1:03:09.583
Well just remember that people like him do not define you.

1:03:10.583 --> 1:03:12.416
Fighting doesn't prove anything.

1:03:14.208 --> 1:03:15.541
Then why does everyone do it?

1:03:15.916 --> 1:03:19.416
Because they don't know the peace they could have in Christ
Jesus.

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:24.791
Thanks for the encouragement, Pastor.

1:03:25.125 --> 1:03:26.625
I should get back to work.

1:03:28.250 --> 1:03:29.583
You sure you're okay?

1:03:29.875 --> 1:03:31.708
Yes. Very sure.

1:03:33.458 --> 1:03:36.708
I don't know. You still seem kind of down to me.

1:03:38.916 --> 1:03:41.250
How about we raise your spirits by seeing a movie tonight?

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:44.333
Um...

1:03:45.916 --> 1:03:47.041
I have plans.

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:49.291
To do what?

1:03:53.666 --> 1:03:55.416
I hope you don't mean the fight.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.958
Danny, don't.

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:00.375
I can't just skip it.

1:04:00.375 --> 1:04:03.375
Yes, you can. He does not control you.

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:05.958
But shouldn't I defend myself?

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:09.500
He's not attacking you out of the blue. He's giving you a
choice.

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:11.291
And fighting is the wrong one.

1:04:11.291 --> 1:04:12.083
Why?

1:04:12.791 --> 1:04:17.916
Because Jesus said to love your enemies and pray for those
who persecute you.

1:04:18.250 --> 1:04:19.000
Yes...

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:21.583
Yes, but it's...

1:04:22.416 --> 1:04:23.750
It's more complicated than that.

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:25.458
I thought so too, when I was young.

1:04:25.458 --> 1:04:29.375
I remember thinking that every slight was a big deal and I
couldn't back down from anyone.

1:04:29.958 --> 1:04:33.166
But twenty years from now you won't even remember what the
fight was about.

1:04:33.625 --> 1:04:34.916
I'd remember who won.

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:37.375
And what exactly would you be winning?

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:40.083
The ladies are never as impressed by the fights as you
wished they were.

1:04:40.083 --> 1:04:43.541
If someone talked to you the way that guy talked to me

1:04:43.541 --> 1:04:44.708
wouldn't you want to fight him?

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:45.750
I'd be tempted.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:50.125
Which is why instead I'd have to fight myself.

1:04:50.125 --> 1:04:51.708
[chuckles]

1:04:56.583 --> 1:04:57.791
Thank you, Pastor.

1:04:58.750 --> 1:05:00.916
You've given me a lot of good food for thought.

1:05:01.958 --> 1:05:02.750
That's good to hear.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:05.583
So...

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:08.250
what movie should we see?

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:15.416
I'm sorry.

1:05:17.916 --> 1:05:19.083
But I have plans.

1:05:19.750 --> 1:05:20.833
Okay.

1:05:24.833 --> 1:05:26.500
But there's something you should know.

1:05:27.125 --> 1:05:29.291
If you fight him I'll have to fire you.

1:05:30.375 --> 1:05:31.208
What?

1:05:31.625 --> 1:05:32.625
Why?

1:05:32.791 --> 1:05:34.750
You represent the church now.

1:05:34.958 --> 1:05:37.000
And the Lord's servant must not quarrel.

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.833
Aren't you quarreling with me right now?

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:42.041
I am gently instructing those who oppose the truth.

1:05:42.041 --> 1:05:43.750
What if I show up for the fight and he doesn't?

1:05:43.750 --> 1:05:45.041
Same consequence.

1:05:45.041 --> 1:05:46.166
Even if there's no fight?

1:05:46.166 --> 1:05:47.916
Showing up would mean you approve of it.

1:05:47.916 --> 1:05:50.041
If there's no fight then no one gets hurt.

1:05:50.041 --> 1:05:51.833
Your reputation would be hurt.

1:05:51.833 --> 1:05:54.083
I think you mean your reputation.

1:05:54.791 --> 1:05:56.625
What's going on with you, Danny?

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:01.083
It's like you're suddenly a different person.

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:04.875
Maybe this is the real me.

1:06:07.166 --> 1:06:08.333
I hope not.

1:06:09.125 --> 1:06:12.416
Because the Danny I know has a bright future in ministry
ahead of him.

1:06:14.833 --> 1:06:17.083
Whether that happens or not is up to you.

1:06:21.833 --> 1:06:27.541
♬

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:30.791
You're always telling me I should take your advice so...

1:06:31.166 --> 1:06:32.000
what should I do?

1:06:32.375 --> 1:06:33.875
[Theresia] Don't fight him.
[Beau] Fight him.

1:06:34.250 --> 1:06:35.458
He shouldn't back down.

1:06:35.583 --> 1:06:38.208
It's not worth getting fired over. Megan won't be impressed.

1:06:38.291 --> 1:06:39.166
How do you know?

1:06:39.250 --> 1:06:40.500
It wouldn't impress me.

1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:43.166
You're not her. She likes the bad boys.

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:44.750
Which is why she doesn't like Danny.

1:06:44.875 --> 1:06:45.875
She might after this.

1:06:46.458 --> 1:06:48.750
You can find a new job. God will forgive you.

1:06:48.916 --> 1:06:50.333
I'll have to find a new church.

1:06:50.375 --> 1:06:51.750
You can join Megan's.

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:52.916
Unless she rejects you.

1:06:52.916 --> 1:06:54.541
Which is all she's been trying to do.

1:06:54.666 --> 1:06:56.750
He should do it anyway. It would be good for his reputation.

1:06:56.750 --> 1:06:58.041
With everyone except Megan.

1:06:58.833 --> 1:07:02.625
And Pastor Jack. I don't want to be a jerk to him. He's the
only one who's ever been there for me.

1:07:02.625 --> 1:07:03.958
We'll be there for you.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.791
And I really want to see this fight.

1:07:07.208 --> 1:07:10.333
Well, even if I go, there's not gonna be a fight.

1:07:10.791 --> 1:07:11.458
What?

1:07:11.458 --> 1:07:12.666
He's not gonna show up.

1:07:12.791 --> 1:07:13.708
How do you know?

1:07:13.708 --> 1:07:14.750
I have a feeling.

1:07:14.750 --> 1:07:16.833
Danny, I saw the video. This guy means business.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:20.416
Yes, that's what the video was supposed to communicate,
but...

1:07:20.666 --> 1:07:21.500
I don't believe it.

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:22.541
Why not?

1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:27.583
Because I'm him.

1:07:29.166 --> 1:07:30.333
I'm the rebel.

1:07:32.208 --> 1:07:33.583
But Megan likes him.

1:07:33.625 --> 1:07:35.041
She doesn't know it's me.

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:36.583
She doesn't recognize you?

1:07:37.333 --> 1:07:39.916
Like you're Clark Kent, and this other guy's Superman.

1:07:41.041 --> 1:07:41.916
That's ridiculous.

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:43.125
You don't believe me?

1:07:43.125 --> 1:07:46.375
Danny, some day you will find a girl who will appreciate
your imagination.

1:07:46.416 --> 1:07:48.958
But Megan is not the one. You need to let her go.

1:07:48.958 --> 1:07:49.916
Unbelievable.

1:07:49.916 --> 1:07:51.250
Our thoughts exactly.

1:07:51.250 --> 1:07:55.125
Why is it so crazy to think that I could be a rebel?

1:07:55.125 --> 1:07:56.791
Because we know you.

1:07:57.125 --> 1:07:58.500
But I think I see what you're getting at.

1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:01.916
You think that if you show up and he doesn't you win, right?

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:02.583
Right.

1:08:02.583 --> 1:08:03.333
Wrong!

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:05.250
No fight. No winner.

1:08:05.333 --> 1:08:07.416
But I'd show that I'm not afraid.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:09.333
Of what? Standing around not fighting?

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:10.583
No one will care.

1:08:11.625 --> 1:08:14.875
I'm changing my advice. There has to be a fight or it's not
worth it.

1:08:16.833 --> 1:08:19.458
[narrator] The more I thought about it, the more I worried
Beau had a point.

1:08:21.625 --> 1:08:24.000
Maybe it would be better if neither of them showed up.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.166
Then Danny could keep his job and Hambone could keep Megan.

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:33.125
It wasn't ideal but it was probably the best option I had.

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:38.250
Cause if no one showed up for the fight, no one could lose.

1:08:41.791 --> 1:08:43.541
But no one could win, either.

1:08:48.416 --> 1:08:49.791
You didn't think I'd come, did you?

1:08:50.791 --> 1:08:52.208
I didn't think about you at all.

It could have been just me and him but you made it public.

1:08:57.041 --> 1:08:59.916
I thought people would want to see. I wasn't wrong.

Did you think it would scare me away?

1:09:03.250 --> 1:09:04.541
You were wrong about that.

You should be scared.

Why? What's he hiding?

He's just different. If you knew him you'd understand.

Maybe you don't know him as well as you think you do.

Don't act like you've proved something here.

Nothing has changed between you and me.
