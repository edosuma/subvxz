If you could be anywhere in
the world where would you be?

01:00.073 --> 01:03.770
Anywhere in the world?

01:03.810 --> 01:05.971
Yes, anywhere.

01:09.683 --> 01:12.777
A place where you could sing

01:12.819 --> 01:14.912
and I'll be your manager.

Everyone dismissed except
Miss Shireen Arshadi.

03:18.612 --> 03:21.046
Please stay to speak
with the headmaster.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.218
- I'll come with you.
- No.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.732
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

03:42.769 --> 03:45.465
We have a biology exam today.

03:45.505 --> 03:48.133
I'm her lab partner,
so I'll just wait for her.

03:48.174 --> 03:49.869
You've been busy all month.

03:49.910 --> 03:54.074
I can arrange for plenty
of free time...

03:54.114 --> 03:56.810
At your service, ma'am.

03:58.785 --> 04:02.516
We usually don't let people
like you into our school.

04:04.424 --> 04:08.258
Do you know why?

04:08.295 --> 04:09.956
No, ma'am.

04:11.798 --> 04:14.323
Because their character
is questionable.

04:14.367 --> 04:17.733
You're late again
with this semester's tuition.

04:17.771 --> 04:20.968
Sorry, Madam Teacher,
it's my fault.

04:21.007 --> 04:22.998
I borrowed some money
from Shireen, but...

04:23.043 --> 04:25.511
Take it back.

04:25.545 --> 04:27.672
Bring it to my office later.

04:27.714 --> 04:29.409
Get to class.

04:45.932 --> 04:48.560
"Your character is questionable."

05:12.258 --> 05:14.453
Cello suites,

05:14.494 --> 05:16.052
Bach.

05:16.096 --> 05:17.063
More specific.

05:17.097 --> 05:20.328
The cellist, the key, the movement.

05:26.539 --> 05:28.564
Pablo Casals.

05:28.608 --> 05:32.408
Minuet in D Minor.

05:32.445 --> 05:37.007
Cello suites, Bach.

05:38.051 --> 05:39.348
Mehran!

05:40.587 --> 05:43.784
The student has beaten his teacher.

05:43.823 --> 05:45.916
The prodigal son.

05:45.959 --> 05:52.831
Welcome home.
Are you well?

05:52.866 --> 05:55.926
Mom has made one
of her special cakes.

05:55.969 --> 05:57.493
God help us.

05:57.537 --> 06:00.097
Eat it for your mother's sake.

06:00.140 --> 06:01.505
Azar!

06:22.762 --> 06:25.754
How about this one?

06:45.351 --> 06:46.443
Mehran.

06:48.555 --> 06:51.149
Here he is,
as good as new.

07:10.143 --> 07:12.236
You've gotten so thin.

07:14.647 --> 07:16.672
Are you feeling better?

07:16.716 --> 07:20.345
Mehran, I ran into Professor Jamshid

07:20.386 --> 07:21.978
at the University yesterday.

07:22.021 --> 07:28.017
There might be an opening
in the music department.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.961
Music isn't for me
anymore, Father.

07:32.365 --> 07:33.627
What are you saying?

07:33.666 --> 07:35.759
I'm sorry, Father.

07:35.802 --> 07:38.930
Mehran, you've worked so hard...

08:22.782 --> 08:25.046
What, are you scared?

08:25.084 --> 08:26.449
I told my uncle that I'd be home.

08:26.486 --> 08:28.579
Come on, I'll make you
a respectable girl yet.

08:40.533 --> 08:41.966
So, what's your name?

08:43.870 --> 08:46.100
Let's see if you earn
the privilege to know my name.

08:47.273 --> 08:49.298
Vanak Square.

08:49.342 --> 08:51.742
What's your rush?

08:51.778 --> 08:53.939
We're having fun.

08:57.350 --> 09:03.414
Turn it up!
This song is orgasmic.

09:34.254 --> 09:35.619
Who is it?

09:35.655 --> 09:38.055
We're here for the sewing class.

10:56.202 --> 10:57.931
Let me introduce you
to my friend.

10:57.971 --> 11:00.769
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

11:00.807 --> 11:03.640
This is my cousin, Hossein,
who's coming from America.

11:03.676 --> 11:04.643
America.

11:06.212 --> 11:08.407
I'm gonna go dance.

11:08.448 --> 11:13.112
Don't worry.
Tonight, I'm your professor.

11:23.429 --> 11:24.521
Shireen,

11:24.564 --> 11:25.588
Ho-bag.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.098
Ho-bag, Shireen.

11:27.133 --> 11:30.000
Protection's in the drawer.

11:31.804 --> 11:33.203
Ho-bag?

11:33.239 --> 11:35.434
Don't worry about it.

11:35.475 --> 11:36.942
I can't hear you.

11:36.976 --> 11:40.776
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

13:42.768 --> 13:44.963
Can I ask you a question?

13:45.004 --> 13:47.165
Does it make you jealous?

13:49.709 --> 13:51.074
Why would I be jealous?

13:51.110 --> 13:53.101
Isn't he your boyfriend?

14:16.335 --> 14:18.200
Boy, that's how it's done.

14:21.741 --> 14:24.608
I knew you weren't such a good girl.

14:53.339 --> 14:55.102
Open your mouth.

15:19.532 --> 15:21.159
Hey, check this out.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.532
Beautiful sparkles.

15:44.223 --> 15:45.053
Pour moi?

15:45.091 --> 15:46.718
Pour toi, madame.

16:13.252 --> 16:15.083
This isn't necessary anymore.

16:17.757 --> 16:21.284
Dad, I'm not going to fuck up again.

16:23.129 --> 16:24.494
I'm sorry.

16:49.055 --> 16:51.922
This is your weekly allowance.

16:51.957 --> 16:54.289
I need all your receipts.

17:02.968 --> 17:05.402
Kids, I have to get to work.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.314
Mehran, I have to
tell you something.

17:18.351 --> 17:20.251
You'll die of laughter.

17:23.756 --> 17:24.814
Hello.

17:27.992 --> 17:31.190
- Mehran, are you OK?
- Leave me be.

17:31.230 --> 17:35.394
Why can't you understand,
I'm better.

17:35.434 --> 17:38.130
I was just...

17:38.170 --> 17:40.365
I know exactly what the fuck
you were trying to do.

18:23.783 --> 18:29.744
Can you help a brother?

18:31.290 --> 18:33.451
Could you help a brother?

18:35.761 --> 18:38.525
Here, brother.

18:38.564 --> 18:40.395
Take this food.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.262
My wife made it.

18:44.303 --> 18:50.674
If you want help, I know a place
that can help you.

18:53.245 --> 18:55.839
Those addicts won't even
leave the mosque in peace.

18:57.750 --> 19:01.242
The mosque is a place for everyone.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.084
God is compassionate.

19:08.427 --> 19:12.158
I'm only here
because of God's mercy.

19:18.137 --> 19:22.437
Seeing young believers
like yourself gives one hope.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.141
I'm Mohammad Mehdi.

19:30.783 --> 19:32.011
Your name, sir?

19:32.051 --> 19:35.782
Pardon me.
My name is Mehran.

19:35.821 --> 19:40.190
So dear Mehran,
what do you do?

19:40.226 --> 19:43.354
What's your profession?

19:49.535 --> 19:54.268
A true Muslim needs to work
and provide for a family.

19:54.306 --> 19:57.742
God has not willed it yet.

19:57.776 --> 20:00.609
Believe in God's plan.
He will provide.

20:25.871 --> 20:27.361
Good morning, mother.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.437
Morning, son.

20:29.475 --> 20:32.308
Shireen, put on some clothes.
You have a suitor.

20:38.317 --> 20:40.342
Yusef, please have a seat.

20:49.094 --> 20:50.925
Shireen! Bring the tea.

21:09.014 --> 21:11.778
Yusef, I present
my niece, Shireen.

21:38.744 --> 21:40.041
Did something happen?

21:40.079 --> 21:41.842
It's nothing.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.415
What a heavy surgery.

21:47.219 --> 21:49.847
My back and feet are killing me.

21:57.596 --> 22:03.432
I'm not that scary.
Tell me if something is wrong, OK?

22:03.502 --> 22:06.164
Mehran...

22:06.205 --> 22:08.469
Tomorrow, we're all
going to the seaside.

22:09.441 --> 22:11.909
Be ready at 7 A.M.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.639
Is that all, Dad?

22:13.679 --> 22:15.271
That's all.

22:27.292 --> 22:29.954
Seems like yesterday,
they were children.

22:32.731 --> 22:35.131
Seems like yesterday,
we were young.

24:44.329 --> 24:45.660
Little devil.

24:51.370 --> 24:54.100
Dad, let's go swimming.

25:02.948 --> 25:05.940
You're all sweaty.
Go in the water.

25:07.486 --> 25:10.284
One day we can all go in
together.

26:26.198 --> 26:28.689
Mommy.

27:26.258 --> 27:27.885
I'm scared.

27:30.595 --> 27:34.759
It's nothing.
You're just a bit sick.

27:36.601 --> 27:38.592
I love you.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.271
I know.

27:49.214 --> 27:50.909
I want to tell you something.

27:52.951 --> 27:56.785
You don't need to,
I already know.

27:57.956 --> 27:59.480
Really?

28:03.295 --> 28:05.923
Let's run away to Dubai.

28:05.964 --> 28:09.456
You'll sing and
I'll be your manager.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.495
You're delirious.

28:13.538 --> 28:17.804
In Dubai,
anything is possible.

31:15.987 --> 31:17.682
It's cold.

31:17.722 --> 31:19.280
Scared?

32:27.559 --> 32:28.958
Dad, pull over.

32:28.994 --> 32:30.689
Are you sick?

32:31.596 --> 32:33.894
It is time for my prayers.

32:33.932 --> 32:36.730
You're joking.

32:36.768 --> 32:39.430
No, it's not a joke.

33:46.471 --> 33:50.703
Atafeh and Mr. Hakimi
will be here soon.

33:50.742 --> 33:53.176
I'll bring tea.

36:58.963 --> 37:00.794
Just wait a second...

37:00.832 --> 37:03.357
This system is hopeless.

37:03.401 --> 37:05.062
Wait, it will get fixed.

37:08.072 --> 37:09.437
1, 2, 3.

37:09.474 --> 37:11.965
I haven't attached the cord
and you're testing.

37:12.010 --> 37:14.171
Can I help?

37:15.547 --> 37:17.139
With the will of God.

38:08.900 --> 38:09.889
I'm grateful.

38:41.099 --> 38:43.158
How I love this song!

39:37.388 --> 39:40.118
I know it's a bit late.

39:40.158 --> 39:42.524
But I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

39:44.128 --> 39:46.858
Thanks.
It was three weeks ago.

40:14.192 --> 40:16.183
One day I'll win it.

40:16.227 --> 40:18.525
The young can dream.

40:35.379 --> 40:37.040
Let's go abroad.

40:45.523 --> 40:48.219
A place we can be free.

41:03.074 --> 41:04.405
We'll go to clubs.

41:06.077 --> 41:07.567
We'll have fun.

42:25.122 --> 42:26.783
Sweet!

42:26.824 --> 42:29.156
Do you feel embarrassed?

42:29.193 --> 42:31.058
A little.

43:47.138 --> 43:49.436
You know what this dork
wants to do here?

43:50.308 --> 43:51.935
Tell us.

43:51.976 --> 43:54.001
Dub "Milk" into Persian.

43:54.045 --> 43:56.673
In the film where Sean Penn is gay?

43:56.714 --> 44:00.650
Milk's non-violent protests
led to a movement.

44:00.685 --> 44:03.552
We'd be like Che.

44:03.587 --> 44:06.488
Here they make Che
into a God-fearing man.

44:09.260 --> 44:12.058
But they can't co-opt a gay figure.

44:12.096 --> 44:13.393
Yes, they can.

44:13.431 --> 44:15.456
They're experts.

44:15.499 --> 44:18.730
They'll make Milk
lead the anti-gay movement.

44:18.769 --> 44:19.997
Exactly.

44:20.037 --> 44:23.006
Don't you want to
change your circumstances?

44:26.777 --> 44:29.439
President Hossein Obama!

44:29.480 --> 44:31.744
Change has come our way.

44:33.718 --> 44:37.882
Hey, don't make fun of Obama.

44:37.922 --> 44:40.447
Don't you see?

44:40.491 --> 44:43.927
What they were doing to the gays
30 years ago,

44:43.961 --> 44:46.589
they're doing to you now.

44:48.165 --> 44:50.656
We'll rock the country with this film.

44:50.701 --> 44:52.726
We'll pour into the streets.

44:52.770 --> 44:55.671
We're united together,
we are gay together.

44:55.706 --> 44:58.834
We knew you were gay.

45:01.679 --> 45:03.306
Don't worry, Atie.

45:03.347 --> 45:05.577
I'll take the role of Milk.

45:05.616 --> 45:08.608
You play his lover,
Diego Luna.

45:08.652 --> 45:10.313
Does that mean I can fuck you?

45:10.354 --> 45:13.289
- Yes, please.
- Sweet!

45:13.324 --> 45:15.315
This film is not about fucking.

45:15.359 --> 45:17.452
It's about human rights.

45:17.495 --> 45:19.520
Fucking is a human's right.

45:19.563 --> 45:22.031
I swear it's a human's right.

45:23.034 --> 45:24.467
Listen.

45:24.502 --> 45:26.231
We dub "Milk" in the day

45:26.270 --> 45:27.635
for your subversive politics.

45:27.671 --> 45:29.639
And "Sex and the City"
for mainstream subversion.

45:29.673 --> 45:31.971
Isn't that a porn film?

45:32.009 --> 45:35.809
It's always the same with you, Joey.
You're really sick.

45:35.846 --> 45:39.475
"Sex and the City"
will sell like crazy.

45:39.517 --> 45:41.314
And we'll throw "Milk"
on the same DVD.

45:44.021 --> 45:47.184
I want to create serious dialogue.

45:49.193 --> 45:52.560
Sweetie, here anything illegal

45:52.596 --> 45:55.827
becomes politically subversive.

45:55.866 --> 45:58.835
Political acts aren't
that romantic, Atafeh.

45:58.869 --> 46:02.100
With the parents that you had,

46:02.139 --> 46:04.664
subversion and naughtiness
is in your blood.

46:04.708 --> 46:06.198
Shut up, Joey.

46:06.243 --> 46:08.006
I can defend myself.

46:10.548 --> 46:11.674
What did I say?

46:13.851 --> 46:15.113
What did I say?

46:44.081 --> 46:45.878
Do you mind if I play music?

46:45.916 --> 46:49.215
No, it's a nice song.

46:49.253 --> 46:51.346
Very relaxing.

46:53.691 --> 46:55.386
We can go somewhere relaxing.

46:55.893 --> 46:56.723
Excuse me?

46:56.760 --> 46:58.193
Don't be coy.

46:58.229 --> 47:01.062
You're mistaken.
What do you take me for?

47:01.098 --> 47:02.395
What do you think you are?

47:02.433 --> 47:04.230
Sir, please stop the car.

47:04.268 --> 47:06.395
Don't think the clothes fool me.

47:06.437 --> 47:07.961
Stop. I want to get out.

47:08.005 --> 47:11.338
No matter how you dress
yourself, trash is trash.

47:13.911 --> 47:17.074
How about we go
to the police station?

47:17.114 --> 47:19.173
I have some friends there.

47:25.489 --> 47:27.047
Give me your foot.

47:27.825 --> 47:28.814
Excuse me?

47:28.859 --> 47:30.656
I just want your foot.

49:12.830 --> 49:15.025
You think I'm hot?

49:31.081 --> 49:32.514
Like it?

49:33.851 --> 49:35.614
Feels good?

49:48.265 --> 49:50.665
Go to hell.

50:32.976 --> 50:34.534
Mehran!

50:37.981 --> 50:40.347
We've missed you, man.

50:40.384 --> 50:44.787
There is a killer afterparty.

50:50.627 --> 50:55.496
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

50:55.566 --> 50:58.626
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

50:58.702 --> 51:02.069
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

51:02.139 --> 51:05.404
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

51:05.476 --> 51:08.172
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

51:09.813 --> 51:12.441
Shireen! Get down!

51:34.538 --> 51:36.665
Oh, my God, are you okay?

51:36.707 --> 51:39.005
Hossein, let's dub those scenes.

51:47.484 --> 51:49.679
That was awesome.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.712
Fuck the mothers of all the mullahs

51:52.756 --> 51:54.747
who shit all over this country.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.593
To Hollywood!

52:09.977 --> 52:12.912
Where's your energy? Dance.

52:16.784 --> 52:18.411
Are you OK?

52:18.452 --> 52:20.943
Don't tell me what to do.

52:37.138 --> 52:40.107
Morality Police!
Morality Police!

52:40.741 --> 52:43.471
Morality Police.

52:43.511 --> 52:45.502
- Hurry!
- Shireen!

52:46.847 --> 52:48.747
Go! Go!

53:04.098 --> 53:06.658
Thank God you got away too.

53:28.022 --> 53:30.013
I haven't done anything.

53:30.057 --> 53:31.285
Mehran.

53:31.325 --> 53:33.088
Please, tell him.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.024
Don't be afraid.

53:40.067 --> 53:42.399
We have nothing against you.

53:46.107 --> 53:47.404
Ali, my dear.

53:53.581 --> 53:56.277
You piece of shit.

53:56.317 --> 53:58.251
You worthless trash.

53:58.286 --> 54:00.220
Always the same mistakes.

55:11.659 --> 55:14.594
I have homework to do.
Let's eat.

55:17.164 --> 55:19.359
Let's wait for your big brother.

55:26.507 --> 55:30.341
Thank you for the feast, Mom.

55:40.521 --> 55:42.011
Is there any more breast?

55:44.525 --> 55:46.288
Wait.

56:02.042 --> 56:03.441
Here you go.

56:23.063 --> 56:25.031
Azar,

56:25.065 --> 56:28.626
don't you think the boy
has become strange?

56:29.904 --> 56:31.269
No,

56:31.305 --> 56:33.398
not at all.

56:37.912 --> 56:39.402
Didn't you want breast?

56:43.117 --> 56:45.585
Is it because I used my hands?

56:47.755 --> 56:51.350
What? You think I'm dirty?

56:53.594 --> 56:56.563
I pray, so I know I'm clean.

56:56.597 --> 56:58.428
You, I'm not so sure of.

57:06.106 --> 57:08.540
Oh, you found some.

57:08.576 --> 57:10.271
Thank you, Mommy.

57:15.883 --> 57:17.043
Pig.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.477
I know you're angry.

57:49.550 --> 57:51.313
I'm angry too.

57:51.352 --> 57:52.114
Cut. Joey...

57:52.152 --> 57:54.712
That was good but...

57:54.755 --> 57:58.020
make his voice more gay.

57:58.058 --> 58:00.356
More gay. Could you do that?

58:00.394 --> 58:01.190
More gay?

58:01.228 --> 58:02.855
Yes, please. More gay.

58:02.897 --> 58:04.888
OK.

58:04.932 --> 58:05.921
Action!

58:13.774 --> 58:14.798
I know you're angry.

58:16.010 --> 58:17.944
I'm angry too.

58:17.978 --> 58:19.138
OK, cut.

58:20.581 --> 58:22.208
Joey, he's gay.

58:22.249 --> 58:23.910
But not that gay.

58:23.951 --> 58:25.077
Get lost.

58:25.119 --> 58:27.314
OK, OK. Let's do it again.

58:27.354 --> 58:28.343
Action.

58:31.525 --> 58:34.494
I know you're angry.

58:38.699 --> 58:40.394
I'm angry too.

58:42.703 --> 58:44.603
Let's march the streets
of San Francisco

58:44.638 --> 58:46.868
and share our anger.

01:00:07.955 --> 01:00:09.547
Yes. Who's your Daddy?

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:11.279
Yeah.

01:00:12.226 --> 01:00:13.454
Oh! Say my name.

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.090
OK, kids, cut. Cut.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:18.257
Cut. Cut! Cut!

01:00:18.298 --> 01:00:20.425
Cut.

01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:23.595
Joey, less.
Guys aren't that loud.

01:00:23.637 --> 01:00:25.901
Shireen, breathe more.
Exhale.

01:00:25.939 --> 01:00:27.372
It's not a Lamaze class.

01:00:27.408 --> 01:00:29.376
You're not giving birth.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:32.038
Yeah. OK. Action!

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.355
I love your body.

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:54.466
Yeah, again.

01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:55.900
Your left hand.

01:00:55.936 --> 01:00:57.267
Cut. Cut.

01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:03.036
Fuck me.

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.544
Will you fuck me?

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.337
Fuck me.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.746
- Yeah.
- Fuck me.

01:01:08.782 --> 01:01:10.147
Yeah.

01:01:13.187 --> 01:01:14.620
Cut! Cut!

01:01:14.655 --> 01:01:16.680
Cut, cut, cut!

01:01:16.724 --> 01:01:19.625
OK, Joey, please,
let me direct.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.752
There's one director now.

01:01:23.197 --> 01:01:25.825
Why are you making donkey sounds?

01:01:25.866 --> 01:01:28.664
Ladies here don't make those sounds.

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:31.694
Maybe you just don't know
how to produce them.

01:01:55.662 --> 01:01:58.859
From now on,
my name is Samantha.

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.161
Tonight, you're going to fuck me.

01:02:03.203 --> 01:02:06.832
- Fuck me.
- Fuck me.

01:02:06.874 --> 01:02:08.341
Fuck me.

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:10.366
Why won't you fuck me?

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.707
Yeah, baby.

01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:14.009
Yeah, baby.

01:02:37.204 --> 01:02:39.229
Get her.

01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:42.800
Pull over.

01:02:53.453 --> 01:02:55.978
Don't be afraid, my child.

01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:59.254
You're not responsible
for your parents' mistakes.

01:02:59.293 --> 01:03:05.630
Is it true your parents were writers?

01:03:05.666 --> 01:03:08.134
Anti-revolutionary writers?

01:03:09.803 --> 01:03:11.600
Face the wall, you whore.

01:03:11.638 --> 01:03:13.697
You have no right to look at us.
Understand?

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.833
Answer his question.

01:03:16.643 --> 01:03:18.474
These tactics might work
with your clients,

01:03:18.512 --> 01:03:21.447
but they don't work here.

01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:23.312
Answer his question.

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:27.350
My parents were professors.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:30.652
Do you think you can avenge
their deaths by doing this?

01:03:32.826 --> 01:03:35.522
Is my brother telling a joke?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:39.521
Hung from a rope,
you won't be laughing.

01:04:00.187 --> 01:04:04.954
You know in these cases
of anti-government activity,

01:04:04.992 --> 01:04:10.931
we're forced to do
a complete physical examination.

01:04:13.233 --> 01:04:15.793
With what right?
You had no such permission.

01:04:15.836 --> 01:04:18.999
We don't need your permission.

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:21.166
Especially you,
who can't control his daughter.

01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:23.039
Do you know who you're talking to?

01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:26.512
You're not in a position
to play that card.

01:04:29.149 --> 01:04:30.707
Please, take a seat.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:43.857
Why is it

01:04:45.165 --> 01:04:49.568
your 16-year-old daughter
is not a virgin, but...

01:04:49.603 --> 01:04:52.367
Know your place.

01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:55.136
Money brings power, I know.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:58.042
But you're not responsible enough

01:04:58.078 --> 01:04:59.670
to control your own daughter.

01:05:21.601 --> 01:05:23.694
I once had a daughter too.

01:05:25.205 --> 01:05:26.832
God rest her soul.

01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:29.735
She's not dead.

01:05:29.776 --> 01:05:32.074
She's alive.

01:05:32.112 --> 01:05:34.273
She lives on the other side
of the ocean.

01:05:36.616 --> 01:05:38.243
But for me, she is dead.

01:05:47.127 --> 01:05:50.927
Raising a daughter
is difficult, I know.

01:05:50.964 --> 01:05:52.625
It costs so much.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.792
Yes, a lot.

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.571
So we understand each other.

01:06:11.318 --> 01:06:12.717
Completely.

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:16.979
How much to forget this?

01:06:18.859 --> 01:06:21.760
We're all forced to play this game.

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:26.492
You should be ashamed.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:34.836
You're all garbage, filthy whores.

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:37.936
Answer me.

01:06:39.012 --> 01:06:41.139
Answer me.

01:06:41.181 --> 01:06:43.649
Are you deaf or dumb?

01:06:43.683 --> 01:06:46.743
And you call yourself an actress?

01:06:46.787 --> 01:06:49.255
You think, because of
who your father is,

01:06:49.289 --> 01:06:52.656
you can do whatever you want?

01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:54.387
Where is Shireen?

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:39.231
Shireen, do you need a ride home?

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:41.763
My uncle is coming
with the deed to his house.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.174
A generous uncle.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:53.344
Sister, your parents are here.

01:07:53.386 --> 01:07:55.650
Fix your headscarf.

01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:57.122
Good girl.

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.534
I'll stay with you,

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:11.935
until your uncle comes.

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.964
He is going to kill me.

01:08:26.453 --> 01:08:28.751
What's so funny?

01:08:33.059 --> 01:08:36.118
You can go.
I took care of everything.

01:08:38.465 --> 01:08:39.796
How?

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:46.104
I could do something,

01:08:46.139 --> 01:08:49.108
so it all disappears
from your record.

01:08:49.142 --> 01:08:51.872
And you won't even
have to go to court.

01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:03.048
My face is burning.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.256
So damn hot in here.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.388
Not as hot as hell.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.649
Atafeh, this time,

01:09:29.683 --> 01:09:31.344
I'll forgive you.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.278
We're all human.
We make mistakes.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.653
But if we repeat the same mistakes,

01:09:39.693 --> 01:09:42.059
then we're no different than animals.

01:09:44.163 --> 01:09:47.759
After months of investigation,

01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:51.328
the Revolutionary Guards
were able to infiltrate

01:09:51.371 --> 01:09:54.636
a secret anti-government
political cell...

01:09:56.343 --> 01:09:57.742
Shireen.

01:09:59.546 --> 01:10:01.537
Now you must get married.

01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:04.015
No more discussion.
That's that.

01:10:05.652 --> 01:10:10.316
The leader of the spies
is Hossein Shekarkhar,

01:10:10.357 --> 01:10:11.824
born in Ohio

01:10:11.858 --> 01:10:14.827
and a Harvard University student.

01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:18.456
Using his dual citizenship
as a guise,

01:10:18.498 --> 01:10:21.899
he was able to conduct
his covert spying operation

01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:26.201
sponsored by the American
and lsraeli governments.

01:10:26.239 --> 01:10:29.072
This dangerous American spy

01:10:29.109 --> 01:10:33.512
is set to stand trial
at the Freedom Courts.

01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:48.417
Hurry. A five-hour hike
is no joke.

01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:49.587
Yes, Doctor.

01:11:05.078 --> 01:11:08.275
I have guests today,
I need your help.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:23.257
Look at the beautiful blossoms.

01:11:23.296 --> 01:11:26.197
You never used to be this slow!

01:11:26.232 --> 01:11:28.200
Respect your elders!

01:11:28.234 --> 01:11:31.567
I'll show you.

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:39.501
You think you can beat me?

01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:50.452
Let's take a tiny break here.

01:11:59.332 --> 01:12:01.163
Like it?

01:12:05.505 --> 01:12:07.029
Have some water.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.064
Save it for yourself.

01:12:09.109 --> 01:12:11.907
I have plenty.

01:12:11.945 --> 01:12:14.812
Don't squander it
on an old man.

01:12:14.848 --> 01:12:17.681
Just have some, Daddy.

01:12:17.717 --> 01:12:20.880
I used to come here during college.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.583
When we weren't protesting
in the streets,

01:12:24.624 --> 01:12:28.856
we would rip off our clothes
and jump in the water.

01:12:28.895 --> 01:12:32.991
We'd create such a ruckus.

01:12:33.032 --> 01:12:36.331
The park ranger
would chase us with his baton.

01:12:36.369 --> 01:12:38.132
"You bastards!"

01:12:38.171 --> 01:12:42.437
We would grab our stuff
and run buck naked to our car.

01:12:45.678 --> 01:12:48.146
I was once rebellious.

01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:50.741
I know what it means to be young.

01:12:50.917 --> 01:12:52.680
Are you done?

01:12:54.554 --> 01:12:58.012
God, see how she
treats her father?

01:12:58.057 --> 01:13:00.025
What's God got to do with it?

01:13:00.059 --> 01:13:02.289
Don't be disrespectful.

01:13:02.328 --> 01:13:05.263
You all created this world for us

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.859
with that revolution of yours.

01:13:08.902 --> 01:13:11.268
Now we're forced to live
under these circumstances.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:15.365
Have I done so wrong?

01:13:15.408 --> 01:13:18.343
I've done all this because of you.

01:13:34.427 --> 01:13:37.225
What's gotten into you?

01:13:37.263 --> 01:13:39.356
You have everything at your disposal.

01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:41.833
If you think somewhere else
is better, go!

01:13:41.868 --> 01:13:46.999
If you're tired, go back.
I'll continue alone.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.373
Rush up, rush down.
Rush up, rush down.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:52.537
What's the point?

01:13:52.579 --> 01:13:55.946
It's exercise,
it's good for your heart.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:04.922
You know what's good
for my heart?

01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:06.482
Being with my daughter.

01:14:07.794 --> 01:14:10.456
You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

01:14:19.239 --> 01:14:20.638
Ready?

01:14:22.976 --> 01:14:25.410
Why don't you go on ahead?

01:14:25.445 --> 01:14:29.643
Like you suggested,
I'll go home.

01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:33.808
Are you sure, Dad?

01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:40.517
Are you sure?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.256
Yes, I am sure.

01:14:43.296 --> 01:14:44.763
At least, take the water.

01:14:44.797 --> 01:14:46.230
No need.

01:14:46.266 --> 01:14:49.929
- Daddy.
- Go, Atie.

01:16:23.563 --> 01:16:25.497
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:26.766 --> 01:16:29.826
Nothing has happened.
They're here to talk.

01:17:06.472 --> 01:17:08.702
I just don't understand.

01:17:08.741 --> 01:17:11.369
She's ruining herself.

01:17:12.512 --> 01:17:13.604
Mehran, out.

01:17:15.148 --> 01:17:17.082
- Out.
- I'm going.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.119
Why did you get me out?

01:17:26.159 --> 01:17:28.059
Should we have left you there?

01:17:28.094 --> 01:17:30.892
You don't even know what it means
to be in a place like that.

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:33.364
You're not a child anymore.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:35.799
Stop these games.

01:17:35.835 --> 01:17:38.395
I didn't raise you like this.

01:17:50.283 --> 01:17:52.843
Don't get caught up
in these things.

01:17:56.355 --> 01:17:59.222
At least do something of worth.

01:18:03.196 --> 01:18:05.721
Sometimes,

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:07.858
we have to accept our reality.

01:18:10.169 --> 01:18:13.866
Atafeh, my beautiful little girl.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.100
My sweet baby.

01:18:15.141 --> 01:18:21.046
Remember how I used
to sing to you.

01:18:55.381 --> 01:18:59.374
With the permission
of my uncle and grandmother,

01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:02.218
I accept.

01:24:07.927 --> 01:24:09.758
I bought it today.

01:24:11.897 --> 01:24:13.194
It's nice.

01:24:15.167 --> 01:24:17.658
With the payment
from my first contract,

01:24:17.703 --> 01:24:22.299
I will build
a six-bedroom home for me,

01:24:22.341 --> 01:24:29.372
Shireen and, God willing,
our children.

01:24:36.555 --> 01:24:40.321
Azar, I'm going to Vanak
if you want a ride.

01:24:52.271 --> 01:24:54.398
Shireen,

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.001
can you imagine it?

01:24:58.944 --> 01:25:02.072
Imagine here,

01:25:02.114 --> 01:25:06.608
huge windows facing the garden.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:13.815
And here,
we could plant jasmine trees.

01:25:16.128 --> 01:25:17.652
Do you like jasmine trees?

01:25:22.067 --> 01:25:23.159
What do you like?

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:26.797
Mehran, I haven't talked to Atie
in so long.

01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:29.803
Can I go with her?

01:25:29.842 --> 01:25:32.402
- Sweetheart, no.
- Why?

01:25:32.444 --> 01:25:34.878
Atafeh and her friends
got you into trouble.

01:25:34.914 --> 01:25:35.938
But Mehran.

01:25:35.981 --> 01:25:37.642
Let's go.

01:27:09.908 --> 01:27:12.433
I can't do this anymore.

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:15.936
Nothing has changed.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.414
I love you.

01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:22.852
How can you say that?

01:27:39.938 --> 01:27:42.498
Is it better if I were in jail?

01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:45.533
Or here with you?

01:27:45.577 --> 01:27:48.205
I did this all for you.

01:27:57.423 --> 01:28:01.883
Firouz darling,
bring the wine for our guests.

01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:21.607
I want to play you something.

01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:19.529
I learned this dish at Berkeley.

01:29:19.571 --> 01:29:21.903
Very, very special.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.473
OK.

01:29:28.514 --> 01:29:32.382
Mehran, Atafeh.
A song for your mother.

01:29:32.418 --> 01:29:34.682
No,

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.383
Shireen wrote a lovely new song

01:29:38.424 --> 01:29:41.188
that she must perform for us.

01:29:41.226 --> 01:29:42.921
Sing it for us, my dear.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:46.556
Shireen is talented, isn't she?

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:50.833
Absolutely,
talented and beautiful.

01:29:54.072 --> 01:29:56.939
But I don't like my wife
singing in public.

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.980
But it's just us here.

01:30:04.016 --> 01:30:07.543
Still, I don't want my wife to sing.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:09.749
You're ridiculous.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:14.588
Atafeh shouldn't sing either.

01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:16.560
Mehran.

01:30:16.595 --> 01:30:19.291
But that's up to you.

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:23.267
You control your daughter,
I'll control my wife.

01:30:24.536 --> 01:30:27.630
Have you become a fanatic?
Going to turn us all in tonight?

01:30:29.775 --> 01:30:32.471
It's not a concert,
it's family and friends.

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:36.106
Atafeh and I will sing.

01:33:15.607 --> 01:33:18.440
"l can't do this anymore."

01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:27.482
"l love you.

01:33:27.519 --> 01:33:29.111
Nothing has changed."

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.224
"How can you say that?"

01:33:40.132 --> 01:33:41.690
"How can you say that?"

01:33:43.068 --> 01:33:45.468
"ls it better if I were in jail,
or here with you?

01:33:45.504 --> 01:33:47.495
I did this all for you."

01:34:21.673 --> 01:34:24.301
Why can't I be enough?

01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:30.113
Why can't I be enough?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.467
Mr. Tabrizi?

01:38:11.736 --> 01:38:13.863
Visa and ticket for Dubai.

01:38:13.905 --> 01:38:17.397
Father's permission
stamped in your passport?

01:38:32.958 --> 01:38:35.358
Tonight at nine.

01:39:31.816 --> 01:39:33.147
What's wrong?

01:39:36.688 --> 01:39:41.785
What's wrong, Shireen?

01:39:41.826 --> 01:39:49.631
What's wrong? We're alone.

01:39:49.667 --> 01:39:51.635
We're alone today.

01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.161
What's wrong with you?

01:39:55.206 --> 01:39:57.299
Are you afraid?

01:39:57.342 --> 01:39:58.809
What are you afraid of?

01:39:58.843 --> 01:40:01.835
Are you afraid of this?

01:40:10.522 --> 01:40:15.824
Is that it, Shireen,
you afraid of this?

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.021
Is that what you're afraid of?

01:40:21.132 --> 01:40:23.532
Why?

01:41:33.404 --> 01:41:35.304
We can leave.
