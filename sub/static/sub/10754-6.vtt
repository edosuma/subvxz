WEBVTT

00:10.502 --> 00:16.133
Look at this. My so-called
windproof umbrella. Look! Look!

00:18.052 --> 00:22.848
I'd have fared just as well
with one of those paper ones.

00:23.015 --> 00:28.353
I collect those. They remind me
of great evenings I can't remember.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.983
- City College wants you to lecture.
- Fine. Just tell me the date.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.403
OK. St Bartholomew's Hospital
wants you at their benefit.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.989
- Pass.
- Turning down a hospital?

00:39.156 --> 00:41.658
Yes.
Don't look at me that way.

00:42.868 --> 00:47.247
I'm with you. I hate how whiny,
sick people are always nagging.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.334
"l want a magazine. I want a kidney."

00:52.753 --> 00:58.258
Roz, I sympathise as much as you do,
which is why I said yes last year.

00:58.425 --> 01:03.597
I bought an Armani tuxedo, wrote
a speech, put off a visit to Frederick.

01:03.763 --> 01:07.893
Then they didn't need me.
Their first choice had become available.

01:08.059 --> 01:10.937
The irrepressible Kathie Lee Gifford.

01:12.564 --> 01:16.318
- Way to hold a grudge!
- This is not about spite.

01:16.484 --> 01:21.114
This is about dignity,
a rare and fragile thing. Anything else?

01:21.281 --> 01:25.201
- Judging the Miss Seattle Pageant?
- I'll do that.

01:27.329 --> 01:31.041
- That's dignified.
- A scholarship is involved.

01:31.207 --> 01:33.918
All right.
You're on in ten seconds.

01:34.085 --> 01:39.048
Look, we have new sponsors.
Work this copy in as often as you can.

01:42.385 --> 01:47.056
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane. KACL 780.

01:47.223 --> 01:50.643
It's a grey, depressing day
in the Emerald City.

01:50.810 --> 01:54.022
Let's hope we can brighten up
your afternoon.

01:54.188 --> 01:57.984
We hold it our duty to banish
your rainy day blues.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.445
First, a message from a new sponsor.

02:01.362 --> 02:03.614
"Death is inevitable.

02:08.327 --> 02:12.623
"But it's especially painful
when it claims a beloved pet.

02:12.790 --> 02:16.627
"lf you've lost,
or are planning to lose...

02:17.920 --> 02:20.423
"...a cherished dog, cat or bird,

02:20.590 --> 02:24.051
"let Pet Paradise console you
with a memorial

02:24.218 --> 02:27.889
"bearing the likeness
of your departed friend.

02:28.055 --> 02:33.060
"Pet Paradise. Though your pet
may be small, your loss is great."

02:34.895 --> 02:37.940
- Who's our first caller, Roz?
- Edna.

02:38.107 --> 02:42.611
She's a receptionist
at a pest control firm. She's depressed.

02:42.778 --> 02:45.281
Hello, Edna. I'm listening.

02:45.448 --> 02:49.618
(Edna) 'Hello, Dr Crane. I've worked
in pest control for 15 years.

02:49.785 --> 02:55.040
'I go in every day, answer the same
calls, ask the same questions.

02:55.249 --> 02:59.211
"'What kind of bugs?
Have you seen any droppings?"

02:59.378 --> 03:03.591
'Then I go to the next person.
"What kind of bugs?"'

03:03.757 --> 03:07.094
Edna, I can sense where this is going.

03:07.261 --> 03:10.556
Even the most interesting life
can become routine.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.891
You need to shake up your world.

03:13.058 --> 03:16.520
Find a new boyfriend,
a new job, a new city.

03:16.687 --> 03:19.231
- 'You mean, move?'
- Well...

03:19.398 --> 03:25.028
There are easier places to cheer up
than this dreary, soggy city of ours.

03:25.195 --> 03:28.907
'Dr Crane, you're right.
I don't have to stay here.

03:29.074 --> 03:33.829
'When you think about it, there's
a whole world of vermin out there.'

03:33.996 --> 03:36.582
Eloquently put, Edna.
Thank you.

03:38.167 --> 03:43.338
Speaking of vermin...
"When that special rat of yours

03:43.505 --> 03:46.133
"turns its toes up for the last time,

03:46.300 --> 03:49.469
"don't forget your friends
at Pet Paradise.

03:49.636 --> 03:53.640
"Pet Paradise.
When a shoe box isn't enough."

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.446 --> 04:09.906
Another radiant morning.

04:10.824 --> 04:15.620
What do you think, Dad? Should l
drive to work or hail a gondola?

04:15.787 --> 04:20.125
I like rain. It gets those
squeegee guys off the street.

04:25.338 --> 04:29.050
Now, stay put
until I can dry off your feet.

04:34.597 --> 04:36.766
There. That ought to do it.

04:36.975 --> 04:41.855
Daphne, get that hat off him. Isn't
it bad enough we had him neutered?

04:43.106 --> 04:46.860
At this rate,
I don't think I'm going to have children.

04:47.026 --> 04:49.821
Just let me dress up the dog.

04:49.988 --> 04:52.282
I've never seen him look that stupid.

04:52.448 --> 04:57.120
You'll change your tune when you see
his St Patrick's Day outfit.

04:58.121 --> 05:01.040
Hey, Derek Mann mentioned you
in his column.

05:01.207 --> 05:05.670
"l listen to Frasier Crane because
I'm trying to drop a few pounds.

05:05.837 --> 05:09.257
"His voice is an effective
appetite suppressant."

05:10.550 --> 05:13.511
- How witty.
- I thought so, too.

05:13.678 --> 05:16.305
Give me that.

05:16.472 --> 05:18.975
"Yesterday he advised
an unhappy woman

05:19.142 --> 05:23.521
"that she could cure her depression
by leaving Seattle.

05:23.688 --> 05:28.276
"It would cure my depression
if the Seattle-hating Dr Crane

05:28.442 --> 05:31.612
"would take his own advice
and leave town."

05:31.779 --> 05:35.533
- Ludicrous! I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.454
You said Seattle was dreary
and she should leave town.

05:40.621 --> 05:44.625
It was one of several suggestions
taken out of context.

05:44.792 --> 05:47.169
- Apologise.
- What for?

05:47.336 --> 05:50.840
For insulting Seattle.
People take pride in it.

05:51.006 --> 05:55.136
They don't want you telling them
it's rainy and depressing.

05:55.302 --> 05:58.597
lf you hadn't noticed,
it gets a bit damp here.

05:58.764 --> 06:02.143
For God's sake,
the state flower is mildew.

06:04.895 --> 06:07.398
Listen, a city's like a woman.

06:07.648 --> 06:11.443
Get one mad at you
and it doesn't matter who's right.

06:11.610 --> 06:14.905
You apologise
or you'll be paying forever.

06:15.072 --> 06:20.619
- I don't care for that analogy.
- I'm sorry. I was way out of line.

06:21.537 --> 06:23.831
All right, you're forgiven.

06:27.751 --> 06:31.004
Dad, to you,
everything is like a woman.

06:31.171 --> 06:36.176
A fast car, a romantic song...
A good meat loaf is like a woman.

06:37.886 --> 06:41.682
A city is not like a woman,
it's like a city. And I'm not apologising.

06:41.849 --> 06:44.935
lf you don't understand,
Seattle does.

06:45.102 --> 06:47.145
Seattle loves Frasier Crane.

06:47.312 --> 06:49.439
(Thunders)

07:02.244 --> 07:04.538
- Hello, Father Mike.
- Hello.

07:04.705 --> 07:07.207
Dr Crane was not bashing Seattle.

07:07.374 --> 07:11.128
He was sincerely trying
to help that woman.

07:11.294 --> 07:14.506
Who's our sponsor?
Pet Paradise.

07:14.673 --> 07:16.716
Go ahead and boycott them.

07:16.883 --> 07:21.304
See how easy it is to flush
your dead dog down the toilet.

07:22.305 --> 07:25.308
Was that a complaint
about the rain thing?

07:25.475 --> 07:27.894
I've been on the phone all morning.

07:28.061 --> 07:31.648
Forgive me.
I'll stick to subjects like suicide

07:31.815 --> 07:35.443
and stay away from controversial stuff
like weather.

07:35.610 --> 07:38.613
- Hello?
- Hey, Doc, I need some advice.

07:38.822 --> 07:43.785
I feel a cold coming on. Should l
take vitamin C or leave Seattle?

07:49.999 --> 07:54.879
I hope you're happy. The switchboard
has had over 50 irate calls.

07:55.046 --> 07:57.924
50? Damn! You broke my record.

07:59.050 --> 08:01.886
The most I got was 35
on my commentary,

08:02.053 --> 08:05.682
"Lady umpires: finally
a chest worth protecting."

08:07.684 --> 08:13.356
- Frasier, think about apologising.
- I would if I'd said anything wrong.

08:13.523 --> 08:16.275
I've got half a dozen calls
that say you did.

08:16.442 --> 08:19.112
I don't want to talk to them.

08:19.278 --> 08:23.783
I don't know how to break this
to you, but it's a call-in show!

08:26.744 --> 08:29.664
(Woman) 'How can you say
Seattle is depressing?

08:29.831 --> 08:35.294
'I've spent 40 years here, working the
graveyard shift at a salmon cannery.

08:35.461 --> 08:38.214
'And, let me tell you,
you fatheaded moron,

08:38.381 --> 08:42.051
'I'm the most cheerful person
you'll ever meet.'

08:43.052 --> 08:46.180
Certainly the most cheerful
one I've met today.

08:47.723 --> 08:50.601
Alas, we're out of time.

08:51.519 --> 08:54.397
I'd like to say,
as I've been saying for three hours,

08:54.563 --> 08:58.484
that it was not my intent
to cause offence.

08:58.651 --> 09:03.280
Since it seems obvious that I have,
I would like to apologise.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.742
I do not find Seattle depressing.

09:06.909 --> 09:10.246
It would take more than clouds
to obscure her beauty

09:10.412 --> 09:14.333
and more than drizzle to dampen
the warmth and fellowship

09:14.500 --> 09:19.088
that make Seattle the only place
I care to call home.

09:19.255 --> 09:24.051
Till Monday, then,
this is Dr Frasier Crane, signing off.

09:25.594 --> 09:30.808
Good grief! Have you ever heard
such whiny, provincial crybabies?

09:30.974 --> 09:33.894
This city has lost
its rain-addled mind!

09:34.061 --> 09:36.939
Dr Crane, we're still on the air.

09:42.903 --> 09:45.072
Thank you, Roz.

09:47.324 --> 09:49.368
Now, we're off.

09:53.664 --> 09:57.626
(Niles) I believe this goes here
and that attaches there.

09:57.793 --> 10:00.712
Are you sure
you don't want me to try?

10:00.879 --> 10:04.758
No, you might crack a nail
or snag a cuticle.

10:06.551 --> 10:10.389
- There. Are we getting anything?
- Does annoyed count?

10:12.557 --> 10:16.937
Hush. lf you hadn't bashed it with
your cane when the Seahawks lost,

10:17.104 --> 10:20.774
we wouldn't need a new set.
Isn't there a manual?

10:20.941 --> 10:25.570
Yes, but unfortunately, Stephen
Hawking isn't here to explain it.

10:32.702 --> 10:35.789
- I thought the winds had eased.
- They have.

10:35.956 --> 10:40.585
- What happened to your umbrella?
- A listener recognised me.

10:40.752 --> 10:42.921
He pulled it through a fence.

10:45.215 --> 10:49.511
You would not believe the hostility,
even at the Café Nervosa.

10:49.677 --> 10:55.016
I thought I heard a new cappuccino
maker, I saw three tables hissing!

10:55.183 --> 10:56.684
(Phone)

10:56.851 --> 11:00.480
- Don't answer it.
- I can't abide a ringing phone.

11:00.647 --> 11:04.651
It's another crank.
They've been calling all day.

11:04.817 --> 11:06.861
Oh, no! They've got my number?

11:07.028 --> 11:10.782
So, the phone rings.
We don't have to answer it.

11:10.949 --> 11:16.287
Although it could be Frederick,
or Grammy Moon to say her hip's out.

11:16.454 --> 11:18.956
We can't be slaves to a bell.

11:19.123 --> 11:23.294
Just because it's going
ring...ring...ring!

11:23.461 --> 11:27.632
or, in the case of a British phone,
ring-ring...ring-ring

11:27.799 --> 11:29.675
ring-ring...ring-ring!

11:29.842 --> 11:32.553
- Just answer it!
- Thank you!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.764
Crane residence.

11:34.931 --> 11:38.184
He can't come to the phone.
May I take a message?

11:38.351 --> 11:42.813
Nice language, that!
I hope you don't eat with that mouth.

11:44.315 --> 11:49.320
Daphne, excuse me.
How dare you speak to a lady that way!

11:49.487 --> 11:51.781
Well, that's no excuse, ma'am.

11:52.990 --> 11:57.995
Only cowards make threats by phone.
I dare you to say that to my face!

11:58.162 --> 12:00.206
Never mind where I live.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.668
(Door rattles)

12:04.835 --> 12:07.129
Is anyone expecting visitors?

12:07.296 --> 12:10.174
I suggest we all remain very quiet.

12:13.135 --> 12:18.098
I have this image of angry villagers
wielding torches and pitchforks.

12:18.265 --> 12:22.478
- Frasier, open up! It's Roz.
- It's worse than I thought.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.900
- Why are you out in this weather?
- I called, but your line is busy.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.153
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Martin. How are you?

12:31.320 --> 12:33.697
- Good.
- New TV?

12:33.864 --> 12:35.908
Got it hooked up yet?

12:36.075 --> 12:39.370
No.
I let Niles take a crack at it first.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.210
God! Martin, you're awful.

12:47.586 --> 12:50.714
Frasier, the station manager
came by.

12:50.881 --> 12:55.093
lf you can't smooth this over,
he may have to suspend you.

12:55.260 --> 12:59.264
- What would he put in my time slot?
- The best of Crane.

12:59.431 --> 13:01.725
What will they do the second day?

13:05.312 --> 13:08.940
How can I smooth it over?
This city is out to lynch me.

13:09.107 --> 13:14.905
A guy cancelled on me cos I work for
you. You're alienating my boyfriends.

13:15.072 --> 13:20.077
We can't afford to lose
a demographic as large as that.

13:20.243 --> 13:22.746
We need damage control.

13:22.913 --> 13:27.292
It's not too late to call St Bart's Hospital
and do their benefit.

13:27.459 --> 13:30.837
- After the way they treated me?
- There will be lots of media.

13:31.004 --> 13:33.089
It's a chance to redeem yourself.

13:33.256 --> 13:35.300
- Listen to Roz.
- Dad!

13:35.467 --> 13:37.886
- Take my advice.
- I did. I apologised.

13:38.053 --> 13:40.597
Oh, so sincerely!

13:40.764 --> 13:44.934
You'll make a few jokes
and self-deprecating remarks,

13:45.101 --> 13:48.229
help sick people
and show you can laugh at yourself.

13:49.105 --> 13:53.735
- I think it's a brilliant suggestion.
- Niles, did you compliment me?

13:53.902 --> 13:56.613
Indeed I did. You're very sawy, Roz.

13:56.780 --> 13:59.616
You remind me
of those amoral PR flacks

13:59.783 --> 14:03.453
who sell their services
to industries that pollute.

14:05.205 --> 14:09.042
- You think it's a good idea?
- It worked for Nancy Reagan.

14:09.209 --> 14:12.795
She was widely criticised
for lavish spending,

14:12.962 --> 14:16.716
so she appeared at a dinner
in thrift store clothes

14:16.883 --> 14:19.260
and performed "Second Hand Rose".

14:19.427 --> 14:23.097
- That made people like her again?
- Yes, briefly.

14:23.264 --> 14:28.436
Tell them I'll MC. Better yet,
I'll take a table at the banquet.

14:28.603 --> 14:31.022
I have.
Give the nuns 800 bucks.

14:31.189 --> 14:34.025
- 800!
- Don't mess with them.

14:35.318 --> 14:39.614
I'm in a precarious position.
I must choose my material carefully.

14:39.781 --> 14:43.534
- I know some good jokes.
- No, Niles. You don't.

14:45.369 --> 14:47.872
lf you need jokes, use some of mine.

14:48.039 --> 14:50.875
Oh, yes.
I'm sure the nuns would love that.

14:51.042 --> 14:55.212
And I'll ask call Bulldog
and ask for a couple of limericks.

14:56.380 --> 15:01.302
I'll call Father Mike. I'm sure
he knows some inoffensive jokes.

15:02.011 --> 15:05.556
Hello.
Yes, well, I don't care how you feel.

15:05.723 --> 15:08.350
I want to use the phone right now.

15:08.517 --> 15:10.686
Your grandmother's hip is out.

15:10.853 --> 15:13.647
Just kidding!
Kidding!

15:29.705 --> 15:34.001
I do hope you'll have
some humorous stories for us,

15:34.209 --> 15:37.630
though, of course,
nothing too racy or risqué.

15:37.796 --> 15:40.174
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- Good.

15:41.091 --> 15:45.596
Last year, Kathie Lee Gifford
told a most unfortunate story

15:45.763 --> 15:49.058
involving newlyweds and a ski lift.

15:56.023 --> 16:01.445
Hello, all. Thank you for coming out
for such a good cause.

16:01.612 --> 16:05.699
St Bart's did my hip surgery.
They treated me good.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.119
I just saw Frasier. He seems nervous.

16:09.286 --> 16:11.997
There's a lot riding on this.

16:12.164 --> 16:17.002
Thank goodness he's got that
sweet old nun there to comfort him.

16:17.169 --> 16:21.006
She's not sweet.
It's Sister Joselia, the scrubbing nun.

16:21.173 --> 16:25.135
- "The Terror of Ward Three".
- You still remember her?

16:25.302 --> 16:30.015
You know the nightmare
where I scream, "Not the sponge!"?

16:30.182 --> 16:32.434
That's her!

16:32.601 --> 16:36.938
- As a girl, I considered being a nun.
- What changed your mind?

16:38.899 --> 16:41.401
I didn't want to work weekends.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.448
- Where did Maris go?
- Mrs Crane is over there.

16:46.656 --> 16:51.119
She's cornered Lydia Beaumont,
head of the museum board.

16:51.286 --> 16:55.498
- Maris wants to get on the board.
- Lydia's getting away.

16:55.665 --> 17:00.420
The "freshen-the-drink" ploy. Lydia
has no idea with whom she's dealing.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.799
Chug that sherry, Maris.
On with the chase! Yes!

17:04.965 --> 17:08.970
She's gaining!
It's Mrs Beaumont and Maris...

17:09.137 --> 17:11.263
And yes! They meet again.

17:12.891 --> 17:16.519
They'll be board-mates
before the dessert.

17:16.685 --> 17:21.357
- Evening, everyone.
- We were saying you look confident.

17:21.523 --> 17:24.652
- Really?
- Absolutely! Forehead.

17:25.819 --> 17:30.783
- You memorise the jokes I gave you?
- Yes. That's why I look so confident.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.244
Shouldn't they have started?

17:33.411 --> 17:36.622
We're waiting for the Bishop
who's introducing me.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.208
He'll be here any minute. Break a leg.

17:39.375 --> 17:44.547
Remember, keep smiling and look like
you're having a good time.

17:44.714 --> 17:47.758
- Right.
- lf a joke bombs, pay no attention.

17:47.925 --> 17:51.095
Do what Johnny Carson did,
make a joke about it.

17:52.555 --> 17:56.475
"Bomb-o!"
Boy, I miss that guy!

17:57.602 --> 18:00.521
Your dad's right.
Go up and be confident.

18:00.688 --> 18:03.357
I will, after I find a men's room.

18:03.524 --> 18:08.487
- It's butterflies in your stomach.
- Not for long! I'll be back.

18:10.948 --> 18:13.743
Good evening.

18:13.909 --> 18:17.747
I'm Father Mike Mancuso
and I've just been asked

18:17.913 --> 18:20.249
to make a very sad announcement.

18:21.417 --> 18:25.504
Every year, our speaker has been
introduced by Bishop Cologie,

18:25.671 --> 18:31.177
our chairman and host of the cable
TV show "Pancakes and Parables".

18:32.887 --> 18:36.890
We've just heard that the Bishop
has had a terrible accident.

18:37.891 --> 18:40.185
He was out fishing this afternoon

18:40.352 --> 18:43.647
when his boat was hit
by a storm and capsized.

18:43.814 --> 18:48.569
At the moment, he remains missing.
I'll keep you informed.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.447
Why does everything happen
to Frasier?

18:51.613 --> 18:56.785
Devastated as we are, we know what
this evening means to the Bishop

18:56.952 --> 18:59.830
and how he'd delight in entertaining us

18:59.997 --> 19:02.332
with his biblical hand shadows.

19:05.586 --> 19:10.257
We also know he would be the first
to insist that we proceed without him.

19:10.424 --> 19:13.927
So, I'm going to step in
and introduce our speaker.

19:14.094 --> 19:17.681
Won't you extend
a cordial and gracious welcome

19:17.848 --> 19:20.600
to my friend and colleague,
Dr Frasier Crane.

19:22.477 --> 19:24.938
Dr Crane? Dr Crane?

19:25.105 --> 19:26.982
Ah!

19:34.197 --> 19:36.658
Thank you very much, Father Mike.

19:37.826 --> 19:39.870
It's an honour to be here.

19:40.036 --> 19:44.958
I expected the Bishop to introduce me
but I'm sure he'll drift in soon.

19:52.007 --> 19:56.386
It's a real comfort to see
so many priests out in the audience.

19:56.553 --> 19:58.680
I don't dare speak in public

19:58.847 --> 20:03.268
without someone standing by
who can perform the last rites.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.813
Whoa! Very religious crowd, I see.

20:06.980 --> 20:10.150
I can tell
because of the vow of silence.

20:12.235 --> 20:15.738
Got some holy water, Father?
I'm dying here.

20:17.991 --> 20:22.620
And speaking of water,
that reminds me of a little story.

20:22.787 --> 20:27.208
A rabbi, a minister and a priest

20:27.375 --> 20:30.461
are all sitting at the bar
on the Titanic.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.880
Dr Crane! The Bishop!

20:33.047 --> 20:38.553
I heard the story with a priest,
but what the heck? A bishop's funnier!

20:38.720 --> 20:41.514
Thank you, Sister. OK, then...

20:41.681 --> 20:45.643
A rabbi, a minister and a bishop...

20:45.810 --> 20:50.773
...are at the bar when the purser
rushes in with the news...

20:50.940 --> 20:53.901
Frasier, the Bishop is lost at sea!

20:54.068 --> 20:57.196
Are you telling this story or am I?

20:57.363 --> 21:01.075
- Frasier...
- I work alone, lady, all right?

21:01.242 --> 21:06.289
Anyway, the purser rushes in
with the horrible news about the boat.

21:06.455 --> 21:09.292
The rabbi says, "My people need me."

21:09.458 --> 21:16.132
The minister is leaving when
the priest says... Sorry, the bishop...

21:16.298 --> 21:20.010
...says, "Have another drink.
The rabbi can handle it."

21:20.177 --> 21:24.849
The minister says, "You abandon your
flock when we've hit an iceberg?"

21:25.015 --> 21:29.770
The bishop says, "An iceberg?
I thought he said we hit a Weisberg!"

21:33.732 --> 21:35.985
Hello? Is this thing on?

21:37.945 --> 21:39.989
Bomb-o!

21:47.079 --> 21:52.126
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:52.292 --> 21:54.086
# Oh, my!

21:54.253 --> 22:01.009
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:01.176 --> 22:08.100
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:08.267 --> 22:10.394
# They're calling again

22:10.561 --> 22:13.647
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:13.814 --> 22:15.858
# What is a boy to do? #

22:17.901 --> 22:20.737
Thank you!
