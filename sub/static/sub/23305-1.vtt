So when we knelt down
at the altar,

46:15.496 --> 46:18.120
-Yeah.
-Everyone in the church
stood up and had a good laugh.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.295
It was great fun.

46:21.330 --> 46:25.610
It is a pity men don't do nails
'cause I'd do yours for free,
Arthur...

46:25.644 --> 46:27.301
How old were you
when you got married?

46:27.819 --> 46:31.305
Um, 16?

46:31.340 --> 46:35.137
Yep, couldn't wait to get out
of the house, away from
mum's favorite boy.

46:36.724 --> 46:38.071
Were you and Arthur
not that close?

46:39.279 --> 46:40.142
No, the other one.

46:42.109 --> 46:45.043
Like all Jewish shrinks,
Adam, he's afraid
of blood.

46:45.078 --> 46:48.322
But, this one managed to fall
in love with a Zionist,

46:48.357 --> 46:49.737
the bloodiest chicks
there in London.

46:49.772 --> 46:50.738
Well done, Adam.

46:50.773 --> 46:52.188
I've been engaged
for four years.

46:52.223 --> 46:55.053
-Oh, wow.
-I've been married for six years
to an Irish guy.

46:55.088 --> 46:56.986
I was working in the...
team and he arranged...

46:57.021 --> 46:58.263
Life is beautiful.

46:59.230 --> 47:01.473
The sun shines
even when it rains.

47:03.475 --> 47:05.270
He wanted us both fired.

47:05.305 --> 47:08.860
And he's sober ever since.
He still drinks,
but I love him.

47:08.895 --> 47:10.897
And now we live
back in Ireland, so...

47:11.518 --> 47:12.864
You seeing anyone, Helen?

47:12.899 --> 47:14.555
Oh, no, I hate men.

47:14.590 --> 47:15.936
There's always women.

47:15.971 --> 47:18.318
I'm guessing the dark side
didn't turn gay yet.

47:18.352 --> 47:21.114
I tell all my patients
be who you are.

47:21.148 --> 47:24.842
It's, it's much healthier
than trying to be who
someone else wants you to be.

47:24.876 --> 47:25.773
[Llion] He's not gay, is he?

47:25.808 --> 47:27.845
So, Vida,
be who you are.

47:27.879 --> 47:31.883
He had a girlfriend,
but they broke up,
oh, ages ago now.

47:31.918 --> 47:34.023
He was thrown
out of the Army.

47:34.058 --> 47:38.338
A group of them were caught
beating up a guy who'd just
come out as gay.

47:38.372 --> 47:41.686
But, it was a misunderstanding.
'Cause what looked like

47:41.720 --> 47:46.173
a normal fight then turned
into this big drama.
Like it was big gay bashing.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.867
Everyone deserves a fair chance.

47:49.901 --> 47:51.972
But if you're different,
people don't give you a shot.

47:54.147 --> 47:55.389
Pick your shot, Arthur.

47:58.427 --> 47:59.290
[groaning]

48:09.024 --> 48:10.577
Have you been to London before?

48:11.612 --> 48:12.890
Never.

48:12.924 --> 48:15.030
How long is the train
journey actually?

48:17.515 --> 48:18.619
Good health.

48:18.654 --> 48:19.586
Cheers.

48:22.382 --> 48:24.211
[Ethel] Do you enjoy
good health, in fact?

48:24.246 --> 48:25.937
Oh, yeah, me, yeah.

48:25.972 --> 48:29.665
I've got an inverted nipple.
George like them just the way
they are.

48:49.029 --> 48:52.101
No, Arthur wasn't
my love child.

48:52.136 --> 48:55.311
But once they're born,
they're all the same.

48:58.832 --> 49:01.421
No, no, no.
Vida, Vida, I can't do it.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

49:01.455 --> 49:02.974
-Okay.
-Please, please,
just hide it, hide it.

49:03.009 --> 49:04.182
Hide it, please. Please.

49:06.771 --> 49:07.634
[all laughing
and cheering]

49:22.511 --> 49:23.374
Got it.

49:26.032 --> 49:27.550
[man] Vida, Vida!

49:43.118 --> 49:45.465
I can't do Thursday then.

49:45.499 --> 49:48.675
[stuttering] I'm,
I can't do it. Wednesday?

49:50.021 --> 49:51.816
Yeah? Okay.

49:51.850 --> 49:53.714
Uh, 8:00?

49:53.749 --> 49:57.511
Well, if I had
half your talent, Vida, I...

49:57.546 --> 49:58.996
wouldn't be
a divorce lawyer.

50:00.342 --> 50:02.551
I'd be playing
the concert halls
of the world.

50:04.001 --> 50:04.863
[knocking at door]

50:05.933 --> 50:07.038
-Oh!
-Oh.

50:07.073 --> 50:09.385
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

50:09.420 --> 50:14.666
And, if you'd like to stay
for the weekend, we can
put you up in a hotel.

50:15.081 --> 50:15.978
Our treat.

50:17.462 --> 50:19.706
-George likes to sleep
in his own bed.
-Oh.

50:20.465 --> 50:21.742
He likes to do it
at home.

50:23.365 --> 50:25.712
Sorry? What does
George like to do?

50:26.540 --> 50:27.403
It.

50:28.128 --> 50:29.681
George loves it.

50:29.716 --> 50:32.960
I don't mind. I let him
do it as often as he wants.

50:39.898 --> 50:43.005
She said no because
George likes to do it at home.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.524
And I said, what,
do what?

50:44.558 --> 50:47.354
Thinking, you know, what,
put up shelves or something?
And she said,

50:47.389 --> 50:49.322
"He likes to do it
at home."

50:49.356 --> 50:51.255
I don't care
about tradition.

50:51.289 --> 50:54.568
Why should I? So I can ask
my parents and my grandparents
their history, isn't it?

50:54.603 --> 50:55.569
Oh!

50:55.604 --> 50:57.054
That's a disgusting idea.

50:57.916 --> 50:59.021
Oh, my God!

50:59.056 --> 51:00.022
What's so funny?

51:00.919 --> 51:02.852
"My husband likes
to do it at home."

51:02.887 --> 51:05.338
[shushing] Helen!

51:05.372 --> 51:07.064
Are you making fun
of Arthur's family?

51:11.240 --> 51:15.969
If you marry this guy,
we have to marry
his family.

51:17.315 --> 51:18.489
-Come on.
-Oh!

51:18.523 --> 51:21.043
Vida, that pink
is really a winner.

51:23.390 --> 51:24.460
[all laughing and cheering]

51:48.312 --> 51:49.175
Call an ambulance.

51:59.771 --> 52:00.634
Pacemaker.

52:01.359 --> 52:03.016
Pacemaker?
That's great.

52:03.050 --> 52:06.053
Most people live for ages
after having pacemakers, huh.

52:06.916 --> 52:08.366
It's all right.

52:08.401 --> 52:10.230
Thank God Vida's dad's
a doctor, eh?

52:12.715 --> 52:14.821
When, when's the operation?

52:14.855 --> 52:16.616
They're doing it
in Swansea.

52:16.650 --> 52:18.618
Dad's going back
in the ambulance tomorrow.

52:18.652 --> 52:21.655
First class travel.
And its free.

52:21.690 --> 52:23.105
You should try it
more often, Dad.

52:23.899 --> 52:24.762
Emily...

52:25.590 --> 52:26.902
[speaking Welsh]

52:29.905 --> 52:32.977
You know you're welcome
any time, Emily.
With or without Jim.

52:33.011 --> 52:35.911
So you always can look after
the repair business.

52:37.499 --> 52:39.086
You can help out, Arthur.

52:39.121 --> 52:41.606
What, Llion doesn't need me.
He'll be fine.

52:41.641 --> 52:43.160
Well, your rich princess does.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.127
What, do you have
a problem with Vida?

52:45.162 --> 52:46.197
God, they hated us.

52:46.232 --> 52:47.129
As does she.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.373
-I saw tears in her eyes.
-[Arthur sighs]

52:49.407 --> 52:52.169
[Davies] Arthur, come home.

52:57.450 --> 52:58.589
Look, Llion'll do fine.

52:58.623 --> 52:59.693
Do you see that?

53:01.454 --> 53:03.283
You belong
in the steel works.

53:04.319 --> 53:06.666
Like me and Ron.

53:08.978 --> 53:11.084
Are you refusing
your dad's last wish?

53:11.118 --> 53:14.191
Look, it's not his bloody
last wish. He's not
fucking dying.

53:15.295 --> 53:16.227
Jesus.

53:16.262 --> 53:18.643
Oh. You know, it's okay.

Hey, Vida, it's Adam.

Adam.

Yeah... [sighs]

What's-- Do you know

55:33.847 --> 55:35.642
Yeah, are you--
are you awake yet?

55:35.677 --> 55:37.955
No, I'm sleep-talking
to you.

55:37.989 --> 55:39.681
Is Arthur awake?

55:39.715 --> 55:42.373
What? [to Arthur]
Are you awake?

55:43.443 --> 55:45.272
He wants to know
if you're awake.

55:45.894 --> 55:47.723
Can I speak to him?

55:47.758 --> 55:50.761
Adam, it's 5:45

55:50.795 --> 55:52.556
Can you call back
later, please?

55:53.453 --> 55:54.351
Just quick.

55:59.286 --> 56:01.496
My idiot brother
wants to speak to you.

Hello?

56:05.672 --> 56:06.984
Arthur, I'm...

56:08.088 --> 56:12.438
I have to tell my sister something very painful, and...

56:12.472 --> 56:15.199
I want to make sure
that you're there for Vida.

56:16.442 --> 56:19.065
Yeah, I'm here.
What-- What's happened?

56:20.653 --> 56:21.757
Her mother's died.

56:33.528 --> 56:34.391
What is it?

56:35.633 --> 56:36.565
It's Mushki.

56:38.947 --> 56:39.810
What?

56:41.363 --> 56:42.606
She's dead, Vida.

56:45.022 --> 56:46.472

-Did she...
- We don't know
what happened yet.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.413
Vida, you need to come back
to the house.

56:57.172 --> 56:58.380
And bring Arthur.

56:59.346 --> 57:00.900
[breathing heavily]

57:00.934 --> 57:02.660
And there's
something else.

57:05.491 --> 57:06.353
What?

57:07.976 --> 57:09.287
She didn't die at home.

57:10.081 --> 57:11.945
She was, um,

Actually, it's traditional

57:57.439 --> 57:59.406
after the funeral,
we eat an egg.

57:59.441 --> 58:02.513

okay, Dad? Why didn't you just
say something about Mushki?

58:02.548 --> 58:05.516
-Helen, please, don't!
-[frustrated sigh]

58:05.551 --> 58:10.279
You're just rambling on
about coffins, and eggs,
and simple

58:10.314 --> 58:12.040

I mean, what,

58:12.074 --> 58:14.732
what about your wife?
We all know where she was,
don't we?

58:19.047 --> 58:21.877
You want me to go
and invite that man
to the funeral?

58:22.568 --> 58:25.122
Why not?
Maybe she loved him.

58:25.156 --> 58:26.882
Maybe she loved
all the others as well.

58:38.963 --> 58:40.620
No, go, Adam.

58:42.346 --> 58:43.554
That is just
the truth, Dad.

58:50.250 --> 58:53.840
We are dust, and to dust
we will return.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.842
[phone ringing]

59:06.577 --> 59:09.338
We bury the dead
as quickly as possible.

59:09.373 --> 59:11.755
And then we mourn
for seven days.

59:11.789 --> 59:13.826
No more shaving
no more bathing.

59:15.448 --> 59:17.554
But we get to eat
as much as possible.

what is it, Llion?

59:45.651 --> 59:48.895

my dad, did he? Huh?

I gotta get some milk!

she'll be on her way too.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.123
Okay.

[breathing heavily]

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.120
Do you have to do that?

01:00:41.154 --> 01:00:43.225
Oh, we don't want
people gossiping, do we?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.918
And it's not like
he's gonna wake up.

01:00:45.952 --> 01:00:48.817
Do you think I should take
his hearing aid out
because I hear they

01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:50.888
they explode during cremation.

01:00:50.923 --> 01:00:53.097
Well, it's a good thing
we're burying him,
I guess.

01:00:53.132 --> 01:00:56.998
Yeah, we might still
get us a few quid, and mum
could do with the money.

01:00:57.032 --> 01:00:59.172
Oh, do you think
I should do his nails?

01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:02.279
You know, sometimes,
I understand why Llion
hates you.

01:01:02.313 --> 01:01:03.314
What? It's good practice.

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:31.688
I wanna do something
to make her proud.

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:38.177
Not gonna be,
baking apple pies or...

01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:40.973
breeding children.
I wanna do something real.

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:44.390
Something real real.

01:01:51.293 --> 01:01:54.262
[Emily] We're about to close
the coffin and bring
our beloved dad

01:01:54.296 --> 01:01:55.919
to his last resting place.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.474
He'll be buried next to his
oldest son, Ron.

01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:01.441
A son he loved dearly.

01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:05.342
He was a good man,
our dad.

01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:07.931
Not a man of many words.

01:02:07.965 --> 01:02:10.174
And he didn't wear
his heart on his sleeve, but,

01:02:10.657 --> 01:02:12.832
he loved us all.

01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:16.733
Including Llion, who he welcomed
into this family as his own.

01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:20.909
I cannot change
that you're dead, Dad.

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.051
But I'm grateful
for all the goodness
you brought to me.

01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:31.748
I would now like to ask
my brothers and my sister

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:34.923
to join me in the closing
of the coffin.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.250
-[groaning] Okay, okay.
-Easy, easy.

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:53.424
-I'm sorry, you don't have to.
-Oh, he's so heavy.

01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:54.322

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.814
Ready? And, one, two, three.

01:03:03.849 --> 01:03:06.230
Okay. All the way.

01:03:06.265 --> 01:03:07.197
-[Vida] Okay.
-All the way.

01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:08.992
You're pushing me
into the door.

01:03:11.201 --> 01:03:13.065
We have to take him
to that room, and then...

01:03:13.099 --> 01:03:14.238
Okay, well, I'll go there.

01:03:14.273 --> 01:03:15.653
[Emily] No, it's too heavy
for me, Mum.

01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:16.827
It's too heavy, I'll drop it.

01:03:16.862 --> 01:03:18.173
[Arthur] Go all the way
into the other room.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.865
Back it up, and then down,
and then squish it down--

01:03:19.899 --> 01:03:22.902
No, you're pushing me
on the wall there.
No, you're pushing me.

01:03:23.489 --> 01:03:24.870
You're pushing me!

01:03:24.904 --> 01:03:26.872
I'm gonna drop him.
I'm gonna drop him.

-I am. I'm just gonna drop--
-All right, all right.
Back, back, back.

01:03:29.253 --> 01:03:31.946
-We need to go
the other way and--
-Needs to go vertical.

01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:35.777
Put him down! Put him down!

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:36.709
[Sara] Oh, careful! Careful!

01:03:36.743 --> 01:03:38.124
No, just wait, oh, wait!

01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:41.403
[Emily] Right now!
I need to put him down...

01:03:41.438 --> 01:03:42.853
-Ow!
-[Vida laughs]

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:43.958
Put him down.

01:03:44.751 --> 01:03:45.960
Oh, my God.

01:03:45.994 --> 01:03:46.892
-Okay?
-Yes.

01:03:46.926 --> 01:03:48.100
[Vida] Yeah, yeah.

01:03:49.895 --> 01:03:52.483
-Are you all right?
-Oh, my gosh.

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:54.037
[Arthur] One. Two.

01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:56.418
[Emily] Turn it. That's it.

01:03:56.453 --> 01:03:58.351
-Keep going. Keep going.
-[Llion] Okay.
I got it on me. Okay.

01:03:58.386 --> 01:03:59.594
-Are you all right?
-[Vida] Yeah.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.526
As you were.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.010
It's not like
he's gonna fall out.

01:04:02.045 --> 01:04:04.461
Maybe if you, like,
could grab the end here.

01:04:04.495 --> 01:04:05.980
All right, yeah?

01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:07.636
[Emily] Yeah, like push it.

I sprained my hand
on the coffin!

01:04:14.505 --> 01:04:17.612

out of there in a minute.

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:25.551
-It's okay, see?
Just hang tight.
-[Arthur] Man!

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:31.039
We're gonna get you there
in time, Dad.

01:04:40.014 --> 01:04:41.636
Do you think
he's slid down?

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.845
-[Arthur] Down to earth.
-Dug the bottom there.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.295
Jesus!

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:46.986
No, I can't think
for the rest of my days,

01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:50.127
my dad's still slouched
at the bottom of the coffin,
all tangled up.

01:04:50.162 --> 01:04:51.853
It's not exactly peaceful
for eternal rest.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.374
But it won't be fair, though.
The worms will get to him
well before.

01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:57.652
Yeah, you wouldn't say that
if he was your real dad,
would you?

01:04:59.757 --> 01:05:01.794
Could we like, try taking him
out the window?

Solving the problem
by all working together.

01:12:55.198 --> 01:12:57.200
I could pay off Ingrid.

01:12:57.234 --> 01:12:58.374
Did I miss something?

01:12:58.753 --> 01:12:59.616
Uh...

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.756
I canceled the wedding.

01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:05.864
And now she's demanding
cash as if we're

01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:09.937
divorcing. She says
it was a common-law marriage.

01:13:09.971 --> 01:13:12.836
And her expenses to cover.

01:13:12.871 --> 01:13:15.874
Hey, you can buy Arthur back,
am I right, Vida?

01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:18.532
He's happy in Wales.

No, Mum. It belongs to you.
You keep it.

No, I'd...

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.550

I was just in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd, um, say hello.

Have you got patients
in Port Talbot?

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:32.838
Thank you.

Ah.

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:42.054
What a lovely house.
You been here long?

Ever since George and I
got married. [chuckles]

gone off to Israel,
a few weeks ago.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.026
She, um, she wants to be
a jet pilot, she's decided.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.651
And save the homeland.

After Ron died, George lived
in his own ill world, really.

01:16:57.889 --> 01:17:01.133
Wasn't much of a father,
anymore. Chased Emily
to Ireland.

01:17:01.168 --> 01:17:02.203
And Arthur to London.

I meant Ron.

Well, I thought Ron
had a heart condition.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.393
Oh, there was never
an autopsy.

We're not even Jewish.

the money on a train ticket.

For your group, and...

01:18:18.245 --> 01:18:20.868
I'll cover the costs
of the memorial,
of course, huh?

Why are you offering this?

01:18:29.635 --> 01:18:31.223
It's from the Royal Academy
of Arts.

01:18:41.475 --> 01:18:43.408
You, you opened
my letter?

01:18:43.442 --> 01:18:46.031
No, Vida did.
She's admitted some of your...

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.241
your animated portraits?

01:18:50.242 --> 01:18:51.865
I didn't ask her
to do that.

01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:54.177
But she did.

01:18:54.212 --> 01:18:57.974
And they really liked them.
They've offered you a place.

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:13.058
Well, it was her gift to you.

01:19:14.266 --> 01:19:16.890
And now I'm giving it back
as my present to her.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:32.215
The doctor says I'm probably
gonna be blind
for the rest of my life.

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:36.219
And then, and there's, look,

01:19:36.254 --> 01:19:39.050
so many broken bones,
doctors lost count.

01:19:40.154 --> 01:19:41.604

Beyond repair.

he's healed well.

the camera.

first for beating me
half to death?

You deserved it.

that stole my heart.

What? And you're happy
to die in Port Talbot?

with where you work
or where you live.

Of course it does, Arthur.

you said that.

I think.

Kiss or slap?

Why you whispering?

01:22:56.454 --> 01:23:01.321
Because it's an old, forgotten
by-law that if you meet
your ex at a memorial,

01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:02.770
then you have to whisper.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:04.669

the videos up, did you?

She hadn't been very nice to me
for a very long time.

01:24:02.485 --> 01:24:05.661
[Sara] I suppose you
still remember the Ethel
from the early years.

01:24:05.695 --> 01:24:10.217
Oh. yeah, we used to talk
and talk about

01:24:10.252 --> 01:24:14.808
poetry and painting. She had
a lot to say about architecture
as well, and...

01:24:16.327 --> 01:24:19.606
and then we had our first child.
It was such a joy, I mean.

01:24:24.197 --> 01:24:27.648
Yeah, but I think three
became bit of a burden, really.

01:24:29.202 --> 01:24:30.134
Why did you...

01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:33.896
Oh, have three? Um,

01:24:35.415 --> 01:24:38.763
well, both our families'
been wiped out,
most of them, so...

01:24:40.385 --> 01:24:41.869
maybe felt it was our duty.

01:24:44.182 --> 01:24:46.184
But duty is the noose of joy.

01:24:50.499 --> 01:24:51.776
Was that from a poet?

01:24:55.504 --> 01:24:57.333
What was the last thing
George said to you?

01:24:59.439 --> 01:25:00.923
"Don't forget my socks."

01:25:02.787 --> 01:25:04.202
Yeah, he had cold feet.

01:25:05.169 --> 01:25:06.031
He's wearing them now.

01:25:11.934 --> 01:25:13.729
Sounds like the two of you
were blessed.

01:25:17.353 --> 01:25:19.321
I never loved him deeply.

01:25:19.355 --> 01:25:23.946
I was smitten by Llion's dad.
I loved with a young
and great passion.

01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:31.747
I do miss George.
He treated me well.
With respect.

01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:33.128
I was always his number one.

01:25:35.233 --> 01:25:36.579
Mm-hmm.

01:25:36.614 --> 01:25:38.133
Not just number one anymore.

01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:45.933
Um, how was your audition
for the, for the Philharmonic?

01:25:46.555 --> 01:25:47.418
I blew it.

01:25:48.453 --> 01:25:49.730
Did you?

01:25:49.765 --> 01:25:52.354
Yeah. Yeah I think that...

01:25:54.632 --> 01:25:56.254
some people are musicians
because they can be,

01:25:56.289 --> 01:26:00.085
and some who are musicians
because they really should be.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.918
And, I can be, but,
music was always
my mum's thing.

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:10.475
I've decided to re-train,
as a doctor.

01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:12.201
-Really?
-A GP, yeah.

01:26:12.236 --> 01:26:16.757
-Warts and blisters
and oozing pus.
-Helping people.

01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:19.760
Young and old.
Rich and poor.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.183
Um...

01:26:32.877 --> 01:26:35.776
Look, I'm sorry.

01:26:37.433 --> 01:26:38.296
Sorry for what?

01:26:39.953 --> 01:26:41.817
Everything I did
that was wrong.

01:26:42.404 --> 01:26:43.267

it's just, it's a blank
apology check. You can just,
you can fill in the blanks.

01:26:53.311 --> 01:26:55.313
Blank apology's
an empty apology.

01:26:57.177 --> 01:26:59.317
I think we're walking
out of each other's lives.

01:27:01.319 --> 01:27:04.115
Um, I wanna kiss you.

01:27:06.359 --> 01:27:07.325

01:27:08.775 --> 01:27:09.845
No.

a very, very long time.
