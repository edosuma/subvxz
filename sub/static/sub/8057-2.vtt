WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:03.607
APRIL: Andy and Leslie
sent us care packages.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.508
"Hey,Ben, just a few things
to remind you of home.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.608
"Love, Leslie."

00:08.173 --> 00:13.021
Ah. Waffle Mix. J.J.'s Diner mug.
New pajamas.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.218
Wow, there's a lot
of stuff in here.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.291
"Box one of twelve"?

00:18.818 --> 00:20.627
"April, here's something
to help you remember

00:20.687 --> 00:22.428
"our three-legged dog,
Champion."

00:22.489 --> 00:23.593
Oh, that's cute.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.567
"Also, you are way
better at laundry.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.128
"Can you please do mine
and send it back to me?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.606
"Thanks. Love you. Mouse Rat rules.
Love, Andy."

00:30.663 --> 00:31.664
Less cute.

00:31.731 --> 00:32.903
"P.S. Please hurry.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.572
"I've been wearing a bandana as
underwear for three days now."

00:35.668 --> 00:37.545
Look,
there's a picture.

00:37.737 --> 00:38.738
BEN: Ah.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.111
That's horrifying.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.377
(sums)

00:43.009 --> 00:44.750
(VOICE BREAKING)
I love him so much.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.598 --> 01:07.669
Okay. So, do you have the
results of the study?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.077
Yes,
and they're great.

01:09.335 --> 01:12.805
Your tax on soda would definitely
lower diabetes in this town.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.011
And I have a great
prop for the meeting.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.418
This is
the amount of sugar

01:16.476 --> 01:18.217
that the average
Pawnee ten-year-old

01:18.278 --> 01:20.417
consumes from
soda every month.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.982
That is gross.
It's gross.

01:22.048 --> 01:23.823
All that sugar?
It's really gross.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.658
What a powerful image.
What are you doing?

01:25.718 --> 01:26.856
What did you put in this sugar?
It's so good.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.059
My first act
as a city councilwoman?

01:29.122 --> 01:32.126
I have proposed a tax on all
those giant sugary sodas

01:32.192 --> 01:34.103
<i>so we can discourage
people from drinking them.</i>

01:34.160 --> 01:37.369
I believe with my help all local
restaurants can get healthier.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.206
Paunch Burger, Big 'N'
Wide, The Fat Sack,

01:40.266 --> 01:41.802
Colonel Plump's
Slop Trough.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.939
Which was formerly
Sue's Salads.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.512
Until we ran
that out of town.

01:48.074 --> 01:50.611
Ah, Councilwoman, in honor
of your never-ending quest

01:50.677 --> 01:53.954
to personally babysit each
and every American citizen,

01:54.013 --> 01:56.721
l went to Paunch Burger and
got myself a Number Two.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.764
Double Bacon Grenade
Deluxe, hash browns,

01:59.819 --> 02:02.060
chili cheese fries,
and one poached egg.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.863
Ugh.
"Number Two" is right.

02:04.090 --> 02:07.503
I also picked up a 64-ounce
Sweetums SugarSplash.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.198
Damn it, I love this
country so much.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.708
Ron, I'm really
glad that you're here.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.573
Our political
differences aside,

02:13.633 --> 02:15.670
lam about to go to my
first committee Meeting

02:15.735 --> 02:17.942
as a city councilwoman.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.379
And there's something I need to say to you.
Please don't.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.284
I know you hate
feelings and emotions.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.619
But I would not be where I
am if it wasn't for you.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.454
You hired me. You've
always supported me.

02:28.515 --> 02:29.858
How can I ever
repay you?

02:31.017 --> 02:32.553
Ah.
Get me a refill.

02:35.688 --> 02:36.758
BEN: Hey, everybody.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.099
So, I've been going
over your reports.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.140
Let's try to be consistent
with our fonts, guys, okay?

02:42.228 --> 02:44.071
There's a crazy amount

02:44.130 --> 02:46.235
of random font differences
in these memos.

02:46.299 --> 02:49.280
Yeah, people. Consistent font usage.
Come on.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.407
Times New Roman
across the board.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.079
No Geneva. No Garamond.
Definitely no Papyrus.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.644
Papyrus?
Are you kidding me?

02:57.710 --> 02:59.986
There's no place for that in a
professional office setting.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.582
Yes.
Thank you, April.

03:01.648 --> 03:05.596
These college interns really
need to be whipped into shape.

03:05.652 --> 03:10.965
But don't worry, because they call me
Devo, because I can whip 'em good.

03:12.825 --> 03:16.136
And obviously, make sure the
content is perfect, too.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.266
Oh.
And 12-point.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.643
Thirteen is just obnoxious.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.043
Great meeting.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.711
Out of the way, people! Motivational
Brigade coming through!

03:25.972 --> 03:27.280
(HOOTS EXCITEDLY)

03:27.941 --> 03:30.717
So, you boys are going to
go work out together, huh?

03:30.777 --> 03:31.915
Nice.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.388
Whereabouts?
Community College.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.618
Yeah, that's too far.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.587
Chris and Tom offered
to help me train

03:36.649 --> 03:37.889
to become
a police officer.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.459
The physical exam
is about three months away,

03:41.521 --> 03:43.467
and I am in terrible shape.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.560
But I can already do this.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.602
So I'm getting there.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.168
So, I've got a list
of everything

03:52.232 --> 03:53.267
that I'm supposed
to be able to do

03:53.333 --> 03:54.403
to get into
the police academy.

03:54.467 --> 03:58.973
And number one is be able to run
two miles in under 25 minutes.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.143
That's a typo, right? I mean,
that's humanly impossible.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.086
When you are able to focus
your mind and your body,

04:04.143 --> 04:05.247
anything is possible.

04:05.645 --> 04:09.286
Anything is possible!

04:10.483 --> 04:12.827
Ms. Pinewood. Recently, many
of the local restaurants

04:12.885 --> 04:18.563
have changed their small size
option to a whopping 64 ounces.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.128
That's correct. And it's
great for the consumer.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.605
More bang for the buck.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.335
Are we putting
bargains on trial here?

04:24.397 --> 04:26.741
How could any sane
person call that small?

04:26.799 --> 04:29.177
Well, if the customer
truly wants a smaller size,

04:29.235 --> 04:30.270
there is an option.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.080
Oh! Do you mean
the "Little Swallow"?

04:33.139 --> 04:34.379
Does anybody buy that?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.317
Some girls buy them
for their dollhouses.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.219
But they're not
very popular.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.259
I mean, for only a nickel
more, you get 64 ounces.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.525
Well, uh, Paunch Burger
just recently came out

04:45.585 --> 04:48.361
with a new
128-ounce option.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.827
Most people
call it a gallon.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.234
But they call it
the regular.

04:53.793 --> 04:57.036
Then, there is a horrifying
512-ounce version

04:57.930 --> 04:59.967
that they call
child size.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.277
How is this
a child-size soda?

05:02.335 --> 05:05.646
Well, it's roughly the size
of a two-year-old child

05:05.705 --> 05:07.275
if the child
were liquefied.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.183
It's a real bargain
at $1.59.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.448
I'm sorry,
Ms. Pinewood,

05:10.510 --> 05:12.490
but why would anybody
need this much soda?

05:12.545 --> 05:14.923
It's not my place
to speak for the consumer.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.358
But everyone
should buy it.

05:16.683 --> 05:17.923
(GROANS)

05:18.318 --> 05:19.991
CHRIS: Come on, Andy.
Come on. You can do it.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.760
GO, go: go'

05:21.821 --> 05:23.198
You can do it, Andy.
Dig, dig, dig.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.291
(GRUNTS)

05:24.357 --> 05:26.132
Yes.
Oh, my God.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.433
I'm so hot.
That was horrible.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.774
I'm going to die.
I'm so tired.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.640
Everything hurts.
Running is impossible.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.704
(GROANS)

05:37.904 --> 05:39.008
What are you doing?

05:39.372 --> 05:42.546
Tom, now is not the time for criticism.
How did he do?

05:42.608 --> 05:45.885
Andy finished his two-mile run
in 29 minutes and 43 seconds.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.322
ANDY: No!

05:47.380 --> 05:49.519
I'm never going
to be a cop.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.259
I'm going to have
to be a robber.

05:51.317 --> 05:52.762
Oh, come on.
Hang in there, pal.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.230
I'm going
to drive around.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.132
Andy? I'm proud of you. (MOANS)

05:58.191 --> 06:00.501
Not because of what you
did, which was terrible.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.564
But because of what I'm going
to be able to get you to do.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.801
I guess
I'm proud of me.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.002
Thanks, man.
Me, too.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.470
We have so much
work to do.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.138
Oh, hey. Ellis,
have you put

06:10.203 --> 06:11.614
the campaign pictures up
on the website?

06:11.771 --> 06:12.806
Oh.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.546
Yeah.
I started doing them.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.980
And are you going
to finish doing them?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.116
Nope.
Later, man.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.390
(sums)

06:28.521 --> 06:30.933
I actually think
you look really good,

06:30.990 --> 06:33.664
except for the stick
up your butt.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.900
Who do you think drew it?
Was it Nathaniel? Ellis?

06:36.963 --> 06:41.537
Man, I feel like these interns do
not respect or like me at all.

06:41.601 --> 06:44.582
Honestly, you could loosen
up a bit on the font stuff.

06:44.637 --> 06:45.672
(sums)

06:45.738 --> 06:47.445
And everything.
In general.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.817
God, this is insane.
They're interns.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.379
They're totally replaceable.
And I'm their boss.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.321
I can just fire them.
(DIALING)

06:55.081 --> 06:56.822
Uh...
Hey, Jen. Listen.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.759
I'm having a problem
with some of the interns.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.196
I'm thinking
of making some changes.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.358
Yeah.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.870
Turns out Ellis is
Congressman Murray's nephew.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.736
Nathaniel is related
to Donald Rumsfeld.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.901
Brittany's dad
is Ben Bernanke's dentist.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.070
<i>Every single one of these little
twerps is seriously connected.</i>

07:15.134 --> 07:16.704
So, new plan.

07:17.503 --> 07:22.612
Instead of firing them, lam going
to kiss their asses like crazy.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.417
Ms. Knope, this is
about consumer rights.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.789
And if they don't want to
drink our delicious sodas,

07:28.848 --> 07:32.091
we do provide healthier
options, like Water Zero.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.392
Oh, yes, let's talk
about Water Zero.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.731
The name implies that there are zero calories.
Like most water.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.170
But in fact, it has 300
calories per serving.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.400
Isn't that misleading?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.806
The zero on the label

07:44.864 --> 07:47.367
refers to the amount of
water in it, which is zero.

07:47.433 --> 07:52.007
If you want zero-calorie water,
try Diet Water Zero Lite.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.550
It has only 60 calories.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.085
Okay. I think
we're done here.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.711
Thank you so much.
Okay.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.053
Oh, Councilwoman,
one more thing.

07:59.111 --> 08:02.786
If your tax bill passes, local
restaurants will hurt badly.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.022
We'll have to lay off
about 100 people.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.921
You're bluffing.
She's bluffing.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.288
Are you bluffing?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.298
The second
your tax bill passes,

08:11.357 --> 08:13.496
this press release
goes wide.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.702
See you at the meeting.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.733
"Leslie Knope Soda Tax
Forces Massive Layoffs."

08:20.800 --> 08:23.337
Oh, my God, Ann. I need some sugar.
No. No. No, no, no.

08:23.402 --> 08:24.574
I need some sugar.
Stop it. Leslie.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.082
You stop it
right now.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.048
LESLIE:
Okay, let's get started.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.179
I proposed this bill,

08:31.310 --> 08:32.880
but the issue has become
very complicated.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.283
So, before I decide
how I am going to vote,

08:35.347 --> 08:36.691
I'd love to hear
from both sides.

08:36.749 --> 08:37.750
Who would like
to start? Yes?

08:37.817 --> 08:39.386
Yeah. I work
at Colonel Plumps,

08:39.452 --> 08:40.794
and word around
the Slop Trough is

08:40.852 --> 08:42.628
they're talking
about laying people off.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.464
So, maybe you could get off your
high horse and help me keep my job.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.560
ALL: Yeah.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.606
Well, sir, I may
vote against the tax.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.800
Because, frankly, I don't
take job losses lightly.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.137
DEE DEE:
No, I want the tax.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.269
My husband started
drinking those giant sodas

08:54.433 --> 08:56.538
and he's gained 100
pounds in three months.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.645
Consequently, we haven't
had sex in 10 years.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.513
I thought you said he gained
weight in the last three months.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.985
Well, we have lots
of other problems.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.652
Well, ma'am, my original
stance was that

09:05.711 --> 09:08.021
implementing this tax would
be good for public health.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.856
All taxation is theft.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.557
If the government can
tax me, I can do this.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.991
Grover, give that
woman her purse back.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.263
There are a lot of
pill bottles in here.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.359
Okay.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.996
TOM: <i>Been making some
modifications to the pace car.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:25.838
Speaker system.
Mad Men bar. iPad dock.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.401
And bam!
Orange racing stripe.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.777
It's a perfect recreation
of Han Lue's Nissan

09:30.836 --> 09:32.838
<i>'m The Fast and the Furious:
Tokyo Drift.</i>

09:32.905 --> 09:35.613
Weirdly, so far,
no one has noticed.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.587
I want to find something
that really motivates you.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.784
Why do you want
to achieve this goal?

09:41.847 --> 09:43.485
I just want to get a good
job for me and April.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.153
Yes.
Keep going. Dig.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.757
Okay, yeah.

09:46.819 --> 09:47.889
Uh...

09:47.954 --> 09:50.059
I love April.
I think she's awesome.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.692
She's all I care about
in the whole world.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.430
Yes.
Love and family.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.438
(LAUGHS) What else
is there, really?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.203
Nothing at all.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.004
I exercise because
when I was a baby,

09:59.065 --> 10:00.442
I had a rare
blood disorder.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.776
And I suppose I need to feel like
my body is in tip-top shape.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.976
So it doesn't destroy me,
leaving me to die alone.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.180
Great! You got
yours, I got mine.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.519
I'm going to go run until I puke.
Let's go.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.320
BEN: Guess what's in
these boxes, everybody.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.523
What? Pizza.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.465
That's right.
Everybody chill out.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.295
Take a pizza break.
On me.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.393
Ellis. What's up,
my male?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.297
Grab a slice
of "za", bro.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.361
All right.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.067
Hey. Dude,
you play Ultimate?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.541
Yeah, I play intramural
at Georgetown.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.303
Dude, so did I
in college.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.972
Whoa. You guys
should get married.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.316
We should play tomorrow
morning in the park.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.845
What about the website?

10:41.774 --> 10:44.721
Whatever. You can put
those pics up anytime.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.587
We should lock down some tight disk grabs.
Am I right, Ell-bones?

10:47.647 --> 10:48.853
Yeah, sounds good.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.058
Yeah? (LAUGHS)
Better than working.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.323
No doubt. No doubt.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.092
All right.
Listen up, pizza lovers.

10:54.153 --> 10:59.034
Tomorrow morning, pre-work
Ultimate in the park.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.036
Everybody's invited.
What do you say?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.334
Let's do it to it,
my dudes.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.671
Okay.
Anyone else?

11:06.732 --> 11:08.609
Yeah. If we put
a tax on soda,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.272
I mean,
what's next? Income?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.906
Sir, you don't pay
your income tax?

11:11.971 --> 11:13.780
Whether or not
I pay income tax

11:13.839 --> 11:15.250
is none of
the government's business.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.651
No... Well...
No, actually, it is.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.815
Well, you don't know my
name or what I look like,

11:19.879 --> 11:21.017
so good luck finding me.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.754
I think we should
tax all bad things.

11:24.216 --> 11:27.891
Like racism,
and women's vaginae.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.126
We're not taxing
anyone's genitals.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.567
Then, what the hell
are we doing here?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.127
Come on, boys.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.538
Okay. Um, let's take
a quick straw poll.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.806
Hold up green if you agree and
red if you disagree. Ann?

11:41.867 --> 11:45.474
"The soda tax is good and will
help people get healthier."

11:45.538 --> 11:47.211
LESLIE: That's about half.
ANN: Half.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.686
Okay. "The soda tax is bad
and unfair to consumers."

11:51.343 --> 11:53.983
Half and half. Thank you so much.
This is very confusing.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.081
MAN: I've got an idea.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.990
Maybe instead
of me losing my job,

11:57.049 --> 11:58.426
you ought to
lose your job.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.521
Let's recall Leslie Knope.

12:00.619 --> 12:01.962
(ALL CHEERING)

12:05.224 --> 12:06.703
Let's do this!

12:08.127 --> 12:09.265
Nice catch.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.774
Someone please tell me
we "Kodak'd" that moment.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.001
Yeah, rock that scoober.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.603
Wow!

12:15.935 --> 12:17.608
You got it, Howie.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.010
All right, April.
What's the score?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.710
A thousand to seven.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.987
Good sportsmanship,
bro. (GRUNTS)

12:24.410 --> 12:25.411
Sorry.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.155
Andy, repeat after me. Okay.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.215
"I run for April."
I run for April.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.885
<i>Run for your wife, son.</i>

12:30.950 --> 12:32.623
"I run for love."
I run for love.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.062
<i>Players at your marks.</i>

12:34.120 --> 12:35.929
What do you run
for again, Chris?

12:35.988 --> 12:38.491
Nobody. Nothing. Does
it really even matter?

12:38.557 --> 12:40.537
<i>Get set. Get at me.</i>

12:42.828 --> 12:44.034
<i>Whoa!</i>

12:44.096 --> 12:46.167
Oh, hey. You okay? No.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.439
There's something wrong with my body.
ANDY: What?

12:48.501 --> 12:50.412
My legs aren't working.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.107
I'm broken.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.378
I need to go to the hospital
and see a doctor right away.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.054
LESLIE: Hey. Yikes.
You look weird.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.588
So do you.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.248
That's a lie. You
always look beautiful.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.985
Okay, well, I couldn't
sleep a wink last night.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.117
So, at 5:00
in the morning,

13:03.182 --> 13:04.786
I went to Paunch Burger
for a pick-me-up.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.352
I couldn't decide what
kind of soda I wanted,

13:06.418 --> 13:08.193
so I had them put
all six in one cup.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.392
Do you know what it tastes like?
Disgusting?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.490
Mmm-hmm.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.229
How are you going to vote?
I don't know.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.498
If I vote for the tax,
then I might lose my job.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.836
And if I vote against it, I
might be betraying my own bill.

13:17.229 --> 13:20.039
It's like I'm floating in this
giant river of ambiguity.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.477
You know, I'm under a warm
waterfall of uncertainty.

13:22.601 --> 13:23.909
Do you just have
to pee real bad?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.471
Yes.
Yeah.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.415
I've lost all
of my instincts.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.419
I'm lost. I don't know
what I'm going to do.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.183
I'm just going to have to wait
and when they call my name,

13:32.311 --> 13:33.847
I'll do what my gut
tells me to do.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.150
(GAVEL BANGING)

13:35.214 --> 13:37.387
Councilman Howser.
Aye.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.224
Councilman Howser
votes aye.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.061
Councilwoman Knope,
how do you vote?

13:46.225 --> 13:47.226
(RETCHING)

13:47.660 --> 13:48.968
(ALL MURMURING)

13:55.401 --> 13:58.245
Gentlemen, it appears
that I have fallen ill.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.683
Mayhaps, might I suggest
that we have a recess...

14:01.740 --> 14:03.378
(RETCHING)
(PEOPLE GROAN)

14:03.709 --> 14:04.949
Can we take
a recess?

14:06.478 --> 14:07.786
Well, your pulse
is super-fast,

14:07.847 --> 14:08.882
but that wouldn't
be out of line

14:08.948 --> 14:12.828
for someone who drank and then
barfed up a gallon of sugar water.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.661
Oh, I'm a mess. Everything's
upside-down. You know?

14:15.721 --> 14:17.291
I mean, when I used
to just work here,

14:17.356 --> 14:18.858
I was always
so sure of myself.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.369
And now, everything
is different.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.803
Oh, jeez.
You know what?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.568
Do you guys know how to
dissolve super glue?

14:24.230 --> 14:25.641
Well, not everything
is different, right?

14:29.134 --> 14:30.169
Right.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.205
BEN: Hey, Ellis.

14:32.404 --> 14:33.906
Elbow.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.577
El chupacabra.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.688
Drinking coffee.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.381
What?
Oh, it's...

14:43.282 --> 14:45.262
It's from 40 years ago.
Never mind.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.321
Hey. That was really fun
this morning, huh?

14:48.387 --> 14:49.422
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.831
Yeah, totally.
(LAUGHS)

14:53.392 --> 14:54.871
BEN: Oh, wow.
Look at that.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.633
(LAUGHS)

14:56.695 --> 14:57.696
Did you draw that?

14:57.763 --> 14:59.071
Uh, nope, I didn't.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.737
No, no, no, no, no.
It's really good.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.713
I mean you're a...
You're a great artist.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.716
I can't do this.
Look.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.420
I don't care who you're related to.
I'm your boss.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.353
And you can't keep
disrespecting me like this.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.288
Hey, man.
I didn't draw it.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.454
Your daughter did.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.683
What?

15:18.517 --> 15:19.689
Her.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.993
April's not my daughter.
She's my friend.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.295
Does everyone think
she's my daughter?

15:24.356 --> 15:27.826
Whatever. The point is she
would never do that to me.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.399
Sorry, Dad.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.782
Ron. My rock. My
steady, guiding light.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.749
Oh, Captain,
my captain.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.445
Did you get that
soda refill I asked for?

15:43.509 --> 15:45.045
I need you, Ron. Okay?
I'm in big trouble.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.350
I need to go back
to those chambers

15:46.412 --> 15:47.982
in 20 minutes and
I have to cast a vote,

15:48.047 --> 15:49.151
and I don't know
what I'm going to do.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.091
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Ron.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.562
The people at the public forum
said they might want to fire me.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.189
So, what?
I tried to fire you.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.460
(LAUGHS)

15:57.323 --> 15:58.802
Okay, Ron.
Come on. Be serious.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.495
I was not joking.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.402
Here's your personnel file.
See for yourself.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.007
"Brilliant work. Commendation.
Above and beyond."

16:10.069 --> 16:11.070
Keep reading.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.875
"Request for termination"?

16:15.407 --> 16:16.909
You tried
to fire me once?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.354
No,no,no,no. I tried to
fire you four times.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.857
(STAMMERS)
What... You... Me...

16:23.148 --> 16:25.321
Four...
Fired times?

16:25.384 --> 16:27.955
If you need to boot again,
trash can's on your right.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.396
Hey, man. What did the doc say?
Everything okay?

16:32.458 --> 16:34.768
The tests and blood
work came back,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.773
and the news is terrible.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.773
(GASPS)
They found

16:39.631 --> 16:41.372
nothing.
Nothing?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.774
Nothing.
The Silent Killer.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.845
Oh, my God. Chris, that
means everything is okay.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.282
Why weren't you at
practice this morning?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.410
Yeah, you should
have been there.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.920
I finally hit my
minimum requirement.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.478
Minimum champion!

16:52.544 --> 16:54.820
I'm going to die
one day, probably.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.726
Without ever having left my mark
on this silly little planet.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.396
I'm going to die
an anonymous,

17:01.754 --> 17:04.290
meaningless
speck of dust.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.391
Wow.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.936
It sounds like you're really going
through some tough stuff right now.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.098
It's too bad there's not
doctors for your mind.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.799
All right, well... Hey, I'm
going to go run some more laps.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.367
Will you time me? Go.

17:16.234 --> 17:17.542
He's kind of right,
Chris.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.742
You were freaking out because
you were thinking about

17:19.805 --> 17:21.079
Andy and his family,

17:21.140 --> 17:22.141
and how you
don't have one.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.453
Every time something tiny goes
wrong, you spiral like crazy.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.984
Maybe you should
see a therapist.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.193
I hope
I'm not out of line.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.456
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

17:35.521 --> 17:39.128
You are as in line
as a person can be.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.961
You are a genius and
an amazing motivator.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.901
(GRUNTS)
What was my time?

17:46.498 --> 17:47.568
I don't know, 43?

17:47.633 --> 17:48.805
Yes! New record.

17:49.501 --> 17:54.280
All my life, I have tried
to achieve external goals.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.183
Run a four-minute mile.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.016
Climb Mount Everest.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.084
But before I can do that,

18:00.479 --> 18:03.289
I need to climb
the Mount Everest

18:04.817 --> 18:06.228
of my mind.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.964
I don't understand. Why did
you try to get me fired?

18:09.021 --> 18:12.127
The first year you worked
here, you drove me nuts.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.400
I would say no to something you
wanted to do, and you'd ignore me.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.236
Or go over my head
and do it anyway.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.306
You were insubordinate,
stubborn, a pain in my ass,

18:20.365 --> 18:21.537
and worst of all,
bubbly.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.546
I was a dedicated
public servant.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.871
Right. That was
the worst thing you were.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.078
The point is I ended up
withdrawing all four requests

18:29.141 --> 18:30.245
to have you fired.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.950
Because ultimately, I'd rather
work with a person of conviction

18:34.012 --> 18:35.923
than a wishy-washy kiss-ass.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.621
Well, I had conviction because
I knew what I believed in.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.493
But I don't know
with this new job.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.429
I just feel like
I've lost my bearings.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.092
No, you haven't.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.528
You may have wandered into unknown
terrain, but you're still you.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.506
You know what?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.772
Are you going to pull
out some embarrassing

18:52.831 --> 18:54.333
photo of me
from high school?

18:54.399 --> 18:55.844
Take this compass.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.778
All great
adventurers need one.

18:58.670 --> 18:59.842
(sums)

19:00.038 --> 19:01.278
Thank you, Ron.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.378
And listen. As far as all
this firing stuff goes,

19:04.443 --> 19:06.719
I will not forget, and I
will never forgive you.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.658
There she is.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.419
Here's that report
you wanted, boss.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.788
It's funny because it has
30 different fonts on it

19:14.853 --> 19:16.161
and you only like one.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.360
Do you like it?
Yeah, it's hilarious.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.873
Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you.
I was just messing around.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.374
You may not take
this seriously,

19:25.430 --> 19:27.933
but this job is
important to me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.980
And by the way, you
should take it seriously

19:30.035 --> 19:31.776
because I asked
you to come work here

19:31.837 --> 19:33.282
because I thought
you'd enjoy it

19:33.338 --> 19:34.408
and I think you're smart.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.914
But you have to have some
semblance of professionalism.

19:37.976 --> 19:41.116
And I need you to give,
like, even a 15% effort.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.655
Twelve percent.
Fifteen.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.456
For God's sake,
I'm asking for 15% effort.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.497
It's not supposed
to be a negotiation.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.157
Fine. I'm sorry.

19:50.556 --> 19:51.796
Fifteen...
(GROANS)

19:53.725 --> 19:57.195
City Councilwoman Knope,
how do you vote?

19:59.965 --> 20:02.502
Aye. Strongly in favor.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.515
The Soda Tax measure
passes, three to two.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.410
LESLIE: <i>Yes, lam very
pleased with my vote</i>

20:08.473 --> 20:10.180
<i>because I voted
my conscience.</i>

20:10.242 --> 20:12.779
<i>And by the way, she's totally
bluffing about laying people off.</i>

20:12.844 --> 20:14.084
<i>You watch.</i>

20:14.279 --> 20:16.623
Anyway, I may have made
some enemies today,

20:16.682 --> 20:17.820
but that is part
of the job.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.157
And who knows,
maybe in the future,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.824
my enemies will
become my friends.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.457
Stranger things
have happened.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.729
Let's keep it down out there.
(BEEPS)

20:27.226 --> 20:28.899
(sums)

20:30.562 --> 20:33.042
Yeah.
I love cupcakes.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.474
Ellis hates you
and he has herpes.

20:36.268 --> 20:37.440
Hey,
what's your problem?

20:37.502 --> 20:38.879
My problem is you,
Smellis.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.507
Ben told you to
finish the website.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.176
And if you don't do it,
I swear to God,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.016
I'm going to murder
you in your sleep.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.453
I know where you live.
Fourteenth street, right?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.216
I'm going to get
a melon baller

20:47.279 --> 20:49.316
and scoop your eyes
out and eat them

20:49.381 --> 20:51.952
and your Congressman uncle is
going to have to buy you a dog

20:52.017 --> 20:54.054
to drag your eyeless
face around.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.697
(WHISPERS) Do you understand me?
(WHISPERS) Yes.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.026
(KISSES)

20:59.725 --> 21:01.432
Do it.
Okay.
