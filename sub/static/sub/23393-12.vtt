00:51.259 --> 00:53.344
Thank you for coming back, Stam,

00:53.428 --> 00:56.222
considering Grace didn't hire you
the first time.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.516
No one ever hires me the first time. And they never come crawling back.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.940
I thought I smelled van.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.651
What's he doing here?

01:08.735 --> 01:11.029
He's here to save us from <i>your</i> contractor.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.908
My contractor is just fine.
And as soon as I get a hold of him--

01:14.991 --> 01:18.578
We are living in filth and debris,
and we have no running water.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.664
You have to turn the water off
to do construction.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.209
You also have to turn it off
to steal the pipes.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.921
Your guy stole the copper pipes.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.756
It's a classic scam.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.510
No, no. No, no, no, no,
we did not get scammed.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.012
You're right. Technically, it was you.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.015
Grace Hanson is not someone
who gets scammed.

01:39.098 --> 01:42.936
Grace Hanson is the person who says
to the person who gets scammed,

01:43.019 --> 01:44.854
"Hey, idiot, you got scammed."

01:44.938 --> 01:48.108
On the bright side,
now you can fix the rodent problem.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.109
What?

01:49.192 --> 01:52.320
Oh, yeah.
You got rat nests all up in there.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.281
Grace, that's probably what happened
to your necklace.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.700
The one you're wearing as a bracelet?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
Oh, my God.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.790
Now, how did those crafty bastards
manage that?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.339
Oh.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.467
What's the matter?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.719
I can't sleep.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.972
Can I, though?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.058
Sorry.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.644
Is this about Roy?

02:24.727 --> 02:27.230
No. It's about Professor Harold Hill.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.942
I can't seem to remember
a word that man says.

02:31.025 --> 02:35.989
You've got four days. It'll come to you.
You just need to relax.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.991
I'm out of relaxation.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.161
You know what might help you relax?

02:42.036 --> 02:44.247
That thing we haven't done for two months.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.458
I don't want to watch
<i>The Carol Burnett Show</i> right now.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.253
Is that what the kids are calling it
these days?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.380
Do you want to go
to the Tappy Awards again?

02:53.882 --> 02:55.925
-Not really.
-Well, I do.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.731
No, sir, I am just asking
for recommendations

03:09.814 --> 03:11.983
from the last five houses
you've worked on.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.697
No, I am not trying to get
"all up in your grill."

03:18.573 --> 03:21.701
It's called due diligence,
you stupid fuck!

03:22.952 --> 03:24.704
So, we've got a new contractor?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.998
No. I'm afraid to pick one.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.500
You know, how am I supposed
to trust myself anymore?

03:29.584 --> 03:31.669
Why not get a recommendation from Nick?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.213
He must know a good,
overpriced contractor

03:34.297 --> 03:36.507
who will steal our money honestly.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.010
No, I'm lucky he's in Japan
for this disaster.

03:39.093 --> 03:42.263
A scammed old lady
isn't exactly an aphrodisiac.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.892
It is in Japan. They have vending machines
that sell old-lady undies.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.229
How could I be such a sucker?

03:49.312 --> 03:52.899
At least you didn't get lost
with your granddaughter.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.859
Frankie, that's not on you.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.321
None of that would have happened
if Sol had gotten you alive already.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.241
I know! I would have gotten back on time

04:01.324 --> 04:04.244
and Bud would never have known
anything about it.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.872
Ooh.

04:07.956 --> 04:08.873
What's the matter?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.584
I've got this weird sensation in my boobs.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.670
Ooh.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.508
There it is.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.554
Oh, I forgot Coyote's coming over.
He wants to talk about something.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.807
No, no, no, he cannot see this place!

04:25.890 --> 04:27.684
-Because he'll freak out

04:27.767 --> 04:29.811
and then he'll freak
all the other kids out.

04:29.894 --> 04:33.273
And when they freak out,
we get Panic Alerts.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.108
Oh, that would not be good.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.444
Especially since Bud
already thinks I'm losing it.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.404
Exactly.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.490
When my daughters find out
that I handed over ten grand

04:42.573 --> 04:44.951
to somebody who helped themselves
to our copper pipes,

04:45.034 --> 04:47.829
they're gonna take my checkbook away
and who knows what else.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.205
What do we do?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.790
Well, tell him not to come.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.212
"I have come down with a bout of Ebola.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
You may not want to see this."

04:59.841 --> 05:01.009
Uh-oh.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.428
"Ha-ha. Parking now."

05:11.936 --> 05:14.063
-Hi!
-Oh, hi!

05:15.982 --> 05:19.068
Didn't they stop making those
once we realized the sun was bad?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.320
They sure did.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.655
Good thing I held onto mine, right?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.910
I gotta pee.
I had three Red Bulls in the car.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.037
-No!
-No, you can't--

05:29.120 --> 05:30.788
But I really gotta go...

05:31.414 --> 05:34.876
Just go in the pool,
like you did as a kid.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.128
Nothing we haven't seen before.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.296
Unfortunately.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.132
-You know, I'll hold it for now.
-Oh.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.509
Um...

05:44.635 --> 05:47.430
Hey, Grace, I kind of wanted
to talk to my mom about something.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.681
Could we have the courtyard?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.976
Oh, Coyote,
I assure you, I'm not listening.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.188
So, what are you dying to talk about,
honey?

05:56.522 --> 06:01.319
Well, things have been going really good
between me and Nadia lately.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.362
-Such a sweet girl.
Get to the point.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.449
And she just graduated makeup school,

06:06.532 --> 06:08.034
so she's gonna move to LA.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.828
She wants to work on one of the<i> NCIS's.</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:12.455
-How exciting!
-Send her our love.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.251
And, Mom, I know this might be...

06:18.294 --> 06:19.504
hard for you to hear...

06:19.587 --> 06:21.297
Only at the pace you're saying it.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.844
I've decided I'm gonna go with her.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.138
You're moving?

06:29.889 --> 06:30.932
Wow.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.142
I'm gonna miss you so much.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.105
I guess I'll just have to get used
to the idea of you leaving the nest.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.108
Nothing sadder
than a 35-year-old bird leaving the nest.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.947
-It's gonna be okay, Mom.
-Yes, I know. I know.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.116
I'm so happy for you, baby.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.331
Now, if you'll excuse me,
this pee is starting without me.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.292
-Oh, wait! Wait!
-No! No, no, no, wait!

06:58.376 --> 07:00.837
Don't go in! We're shooting a porno!

07:00.920 --> 07:02.004
Oh, God!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.549
Jesus, what happened?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.634
We're renovating!

07:06.717 --> 07:09.178
There's a tub on your kitchen island!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.888
I know! Isn't it great?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.391
The French call that
a<i> "cuisine de baignoire."</i>

07:13.808 --> 07:15.726
-"Tub kitchen."

07:16.769 --> 07:18.271
Where are your pipes?

07:18.354 --> 07:19.605
What's going on here, Mom?

07:19.689 --> 07:22.358
We had a situation with a contractor,
but we're handling it.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.403
This does not look handled to me.
I'm calling Bud.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.904
No, no, no, no, no!

07:26.988 --> 07:28.448
That's how that gets there!

07:28.531 --> 07:30.199
You're not telling nobody nothin'!

07:30.283 --> 07:31.868
No, I've got to tell somebody.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.119
Oh, grab an arm!

07:34.454 --> 07:37.790
So... you really like that Nadia girl,
don't you?

07:37.874 --> 07:40.460
-Yeah.
-She's real pretty.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.380
Yeah. Shame if she should happen
to drown in a kitchen tub.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.215
A<i> cuisine de baignoire?</i>

07:46.757 --> 07:50.261
Look, Coyote, I have kept
a lot of your secrets.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.846
You could keep one of mine.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.931
Fine. I won't tell Bud.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.641
Or anyone.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.393
Or anyone.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.899
Look, just promise me that you won't go
upstairs until we know it's safe.

08:02.982 --> 08:03.900
-We promise.
-Sure.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.611
And don't look outside.
I'm gonna pee in the pool.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.405
-Here, take your phone.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.245
-Oh, I have to get ready for the play.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.623
You can't go up there!
We promised Coyote.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.459
Well, I have to look stunning,
or people are gonna suspect something.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.336
You're already stunning!

08:23.878 --> 08:26.047
I mean, your hair has looked better.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.049
And actually, I don't love that outfit.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.967
Oh, God! Oh, God, my knee!

08:30.051 --> 08:31.844
Oh, my-- Oh!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.222
Oh, Grace! You've got to be more careful!

08:36.641 --> 08:39.644
-Right this way.
-The kids aren't gonna think twice

08:39.727 --> 08:41.312
about seeing you with a cane.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.272
They know you just had knee surgery.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.815
On the other knee.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.443
Now they're gonna think
I'm totally crippled.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.363
For God's sake, Mallory's already
sending me brochures of stair chairs.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.574
I saw. Did you know
that the Motion-Glide XL

08:53.658 --> 08:56.827
climbs a ten-foot staircase
in under 20 minutes?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.371
Stop reading those.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.206
But they're so glossy and sad.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.291
-These are your seats, ma'am.
-Thank you.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.254
Thank you so much for...
letting us in early.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.715
Oh, no need.
We're happy to seat all of our elderly

09:09.799 --> 09:11.926
and special needs patrons in advance.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.013
Well consider it hush money
and hush the eff up.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.182
Enjoy the show.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.894
Do you really think you're gonna be able
to hide your crap knee from everyone?

09:21.978 --> 09:22.812
Yes!

09:22.895 --> 09:26.816
I'm planting myself here
and I'm not moving it all night.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.902
What if there's a standing ovation?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.321
I'll cross that bridge
when it never happens.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.161
Hold on. Hold on.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.456
I need to prepare myself
for this nightmare. Well, I love musical theater.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.213
In eighth grade, I was the beatboxing
wizard in<i> The Bee Keeper's Promise.</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:51.048
What the hell show was that?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.133
I wrote it.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.135
It was based on<i> Macbeth.</i>

09:55.845 --> 09:57.805
Sadly, not even dreading
the musical theater part.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.557
I'm just dreading seeing my mother.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.976
She could surprise you.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.228
Like a surprise attack?

10:04.312 --> 10:08.441
-You're right. You walk in ahead of me.
-She may not even be mad at you.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.944
Wow! You really don't know her.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.280
Yeah, but I really know her daughter.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.782
And?

10:17.241 --> 10:19.243
Oh, come on.
You don't see the similarities?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.039
Someone who needs to be strong
and resists getting help.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.250
And when it comes to having to deal
with her feelings, she...

10:27.668 --> 10:28.836
self-medicates.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.591
I don't know what you're
talking about right now, okay?

10:33.674 --> 10:36.052
But we really need to focus on strategy.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.846
When I approach her,
if I say the word "kumquat,"

10:38.929 --> 10:40.389
that means you have to lift me up

10:40.473 --> 10:42.558
and then fireman-carry me
out of the theater.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.896
-It's very mild.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.689
But I've been high since breakfast.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.366
-Hi.
-Mm.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.581
Oh.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.583
Are you trying to dodge me?

11:07.667 --> 11:08.959
I just walked in.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.712
When are you gonna bring me back to life?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.172
Frankie, I'm working on it.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.674
Great! Can you get it done
by the time the show finishes?

11:15.758 --> 11:18.719
Well, the second act of<i> The Music Man</i>
could use a few cuts,

11:18.803 --> 11:21.389
but this is the government
we're talking about.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.473
Whatevs!

11:22.556 --> 11:27.103
I'm gonna need you to tell Bud
that it's done and I am officially alive.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.729
I can't lie to my son.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.941
You were comfortable telling him
that President Reagan wrote back to him

11:32.024 --> 11:34.985
and said, "I hear you.
I've made some mistakes."

11:35.069 --> 11:36.570
He still has that letter framed!

11:36.654 --> 11:39.490
Yeah, well, dreams die hard
in the big city, Sol.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.991
Just do it!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.415
Are you okay, Dad?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.291
It's just...

11:50.543 --> 11:53.879
your mother wants me to lie
to your brother about something.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.465
She got to you, too.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.595
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, honey.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.139
So, I'm trying out a new babysitter,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.433
and I wanted to sit on the aisle
in case she calls.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.854
And she will. My children are
heavily discussed on babysitter forums.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.523
So can I sit there? No.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.527
It's just I've never used
this service before.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.486
No.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.531
Okay. Can you at least let me by?

12:20.614 --> 12:21.574
No.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.493
You're really gonna make me walk
all the way around?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.453
Yes.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.956
Mom, is your knee still bothering you?

12:29.039 --> 12:32.501
Yes, Mallory, my knee is in terrible pain
and I'm keeping it from you.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.006
It's all one big conspiracy to conceal
my enfeeblement from my children.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.886
All right.

12:42.636 --> 12:43.804
Jeez.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.057
Sucker.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.021
-Look who I found wandering the lobby.
-Ah.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.273
Your dad has some good news.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.399
Don't you, Sol?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.109
Yes.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.778
Wonderful news.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.324
It appears
that the Social Security Administration

13:03.407 --> 13:07.369
received our letter
about your mom's death mix-up.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.247
-Good to know the post office still works.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.334
Uh... We sent it FedEx,
but it is encouraging.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.002
Sol.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.298
It seems that everything is,

13:19.381 --> 13:21.133
-um...
-I'm alive again.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.595
And fully capable and equipped
for all your babysitting needs.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.182
You can have Faith with me
and you can have faith in me.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.809
No, that didn't sound quite right.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.063
Oh, boy.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.856
What's he doing here?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.733
Uh... Excuse me.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.611
Roy! You're here.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.321
Hey!

13:42.988 --> 13:45.157
Oh, I couldn't miss Robert's big night.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.825
Are you surprised?

13:47.868 --> 13:48.911
Little bit.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.330
Don't you know what this means?

13:51.413 --> 13:52.957
Everything's back to normal.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.502
Now Faith and I can use
my rewards points from Red Lobster.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.504
And it's Summerfest.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.841
Mom, I am really happy
you're legally alive again.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.301
I really am.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.720
But it still doesn't change what happened.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.681
But it never would've happened if--

14:08.764 --> 14:11.267
You've got to stop blaming everything
on being dead.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.312
You... You followed a truck to Mexico
with my daughter.

14:15.396 --> 14:19.567
Okay, okay. I won't take
any long road trips with Faith.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.862
-Mom--
-Okay, any trips!

14:22.945 --> 14:26.031
Look, we want you to see the baby
as much as you want.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.950
Good! When can I babysit?

14:28.033 --> 14:31.620
I'm available every day
9:00 a.m. to midnight.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.456
Who am I kidding? Noon to midnight.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.375
You can babysit whenever...

14:36.709 --> 14:39.295
just as long as we're there, too.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.508
You don't want me to be alone with Faith?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.261
Mom, it's-- it's just after, you know--

14:47.344 --> 14:49.680
I can take care of my grandchild.

14:49.763 --> 14:53.434
Actually, Allison and I
are afraid you can't.

14:54.935 --> 14:55.936
What?

14:57.062 --> 14:58.981
Faith was fine.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.734
She was never in jeopardy.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.444
This time.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.613
Think about it.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.450
You would never be able to forgive
yourself if something were to happen.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.414
I'm so sorry.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.506
Oh, God, I love community theater.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.217
When it's good, it's great.
And when it's bad, I take pictures.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.011
You think Robert'll be excited I'm here?

15:29.094 --> 15:32.890
I think Robert will experience
a range of emotions.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.603
Everyone, places in five.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.744
Robert, I was just going over
my to-do list

15:53.827 --> 15:57.331
and the only thing on there is "Make sure
Robert doesn't screw this up for me."

15:58.123 --> 15:59.750
Can I check off that box?

15:59.833 --> 16:00.751
Look.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.879
Actors, places please!
-The guy I was telling you about.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.760
Oh, my. Now I see why
you didn't give Sol the go-ahead.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.389
So why'd he go ahead
and come to my show?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.391
Robert, you need to focus

16:15.474 --> 16:17.893
and take your mind off
that absolutely stunning man

16:17.977 --> 16:20.354
who might be going commando
sitting next to your husband.

16:20.437 --> 16:24.191
I know. I know. It's just...
How am I supposed to ignore that?

16:24.274 --> 16:25.859
Don't ignore it. Use it.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.238
Let your rage and jealousy
fuel your performance.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.156
If Sol's flirting with Roy,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.242
flirt harder through song.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.829
You're the Music Man, damn it.
You can charm a whole town.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.123
I am the Music Man.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.000
I could charm the whole damn country.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.711
Let's just focus on the town.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.842
-There's two. Over--
-Actually, your mom is-- She's there.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.303
Hey, Mom. You okay?

16:53.679 --> 16:54.596
I'm fine.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.099
Cool. Cool. Um...

16:57.266 --> 17:01.311
I mean, are we okay? Because I know
after that conversation last week--

17:01.395 --> 17:02.354
I understand.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.650
Let's just have a good time tonight
and you go ahead and get in your seat.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.069
So we're good?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.030
All good.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.116
Wow. Thanks, Mom.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.619
So, can we sneak by?

17:17.995 --> 17:18.829
No.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.582
-No.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.293
-Yes.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.377
Oh, my...

17:25.919 --> 17:27.212
-Kumquat.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.297
Forget it.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.261
What's the matter?

17:34.803 --> 17:37.806
Bud doesn't trust me
to be alone with the baby.

17:38.807 --> 17:42.102
When I watch Faith,
someone needs to watch me.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.897
Oh, my God, Frankie. That's terrible.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.567
And now this.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.736
<i>♪ Our children's children</i>
<i>Gonna have trouble ♪</i>

17:50.819 --> 17:54.198

17:58.535 --> 18:01.747

of corruption.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.791
<i>♪ Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble ♪</i>

18:03.874 --> 18:05.542
The minute your son leaves the house,

18:05.626 --> 18:08.921
does he re-buckle his knickerbockers
below the knee?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.173
Is there a nicotine stain
on his index finger?

18:11.256 --> 18:13.675
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.554
Is he starting to memorize jokes
from<i> Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?</i>

18:17.638 --> 18:20.682
Are certain words
creeping into his conversation?

18:20.766 --> 18:21.809
Words like...

18:22.184 --> 18:24.937
"swell" and "so's your old man"?

18:25.020 --> 18:27.106

19:13.902 --> 19:15.988
I think that might have been meant for me.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.197
You want to fight for it?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.324
-Ha, ha.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.376
-He was so good!
-He was!

19:29.459 --> 19:31.503
Almost makes me forget that thing he did.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.384
Mom, do you mind if I just sneak past you?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.595
Do you mind showing your father
some goddamn respect

19:39.678 --> 19:40.888
and staying in your seat?

19:40.971 --> 19:42.264
Yeah, sit down.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.555
-No, thank you.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.182
Come on, join the band!

20:25.265 --> 20:27.768
You touch me again
and I'll break your arms, too.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.493
Looks like you've directed Robert
towards another Tappy-worthy performance.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.995
Oh, it took everything I have.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.207
I hope it was worth my two broken legs.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.126
Oh, stop. I don't care about awards.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.172
-Well, you were amazing, obviously.
-Oh.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.634
-I smell another Tappy.
-Oh, get out of here.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.761
You know, it's um...

21:03.178 --> 21:06.390
it's no wonder you carried that show.
You sure have the shoulders for it.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.644
Well, actually,
I'm better known for my calves.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.645
Oh?

21:13.230 --> 21:14.564
Are Grace and Mom here yet?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.108
Oh, they're not coming.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.402
Mom's probably still sitting
in the theater.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.987
Yeah. What was up with that?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.906
That was so weird
they didn't want to leave with us.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.950
Maybe your mom's waiting
for a scooter cart.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.829
Oh, my God. Can you imagine my mom
on one of those scooters?

21:30.163 --> 21:31.164
Yeah.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.501
What?
What?

21:36.169 --> 21:39.131
-Shit. Not...
"Shit"?

21:39.214 --> 21:42.384
Spill the shit, Barry.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.929
Look, she told me not to tell you,
but I was at the hardware store

21:46.013 --> 21:50.642
and I saw your mom and...
she had to use one of those scooter carts.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.603
Our mother is not a scooter cart person.

21:53.687 --> 21:57.274
Yeah, well she was this day and she was
swerving all over the place, you know...

21:57.357 --> 21:59.860
-drunk.
-Okay. Hilarious.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.778
But why didn't she want you to tell me?

22:01.862 --> 22:02.863
I believe the quote was,

22:02.946 --> 22:06.450
"She's mean, she's judgmental,
and she'll put me in a home."

22:06.533 --> 22:07.743
-She's got you pegged.
-Yeah.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.038
-She also ran into a cop car.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.873
She hit a cop car?

22:12.956 --> 22:14.958
-Even I never did that.
-Yes, you did.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.794
-Oh, yes, I did.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.880
-Yes.
-No.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.131
She's fine.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.674
She has Frankie.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.093
Uh, well, she's not really any help.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.305
I mean, she just got lost
following an ice cream truck.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.766
Isn't that, like,
every other Tuesday with her?

22:30.849 --> 22:34.686
This time she had my daughter
and got stranded at the Mexican border.

22:35.103 --> 22:37.230
-Ooh. That's bad.
-Wow.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.942
Yeah. Yeah. Whole new level of bad.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.278
What is going on with them?

22:49.076 --> 22:51.536
Coyote, why so quiet?

22:56.166 --> 22:59.711
Hey, uh, you guys ever do that thing
where you stretch,

22:59.795 --> 23:01.129
and then your head gets dizzy,

23:01.213 --> 23:04.841
and you see those little pieces
of tin foil flying around?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.259
Coyote, what do you know?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.513
Historically, very little.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.526
Hey, there you are, stranger.
Want something good in your mouth?

23:22.859 --> 23:23.693
Pardon?

23:24.069 --> 23:24.986
Here.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.447
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.448
It's good, right?

23:28.532 --> 23:32.202
Robert, were you even listening
to my colonoscopy story?

23:33.703 --> 23:35.163
They're eating cake.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.086
Cake is how my colonoscopy story started.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.965
You know how you're not supposed
to eat before a colonoscopy?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.258
Well, I did.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.677
And I lied about it.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.846
It all started when I...

23:52.889 --> 23:55.809
Liked the show,
but I wish there'd been more marching.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.687
The marching was a nice distraction.

23:59.062 --> 24:03.775
I kept thinking how I'm never going
to be alone with my grandchild again.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.860
Yeah.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.239
-Rats!
-Yeah, rats. Rats to this whole day.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.490
No, I saw a rat!

24:11.199 --> 24:13.118
Ah! Grace, there's a rat!

24:13.201 --> 24:14.703
Take the high ground! Ah!

24:14.786 --> 24:18.707
-Get over! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

24:18.790 --> 24:20.083
Ooh! God!

24:21.793 --> 24:24.212
You know, I uh...
I should have warned you,

24:25.046 --> 24:26.965
I'm always the last one to leave.

24:27.924 --> 24:28.800
That's okay.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.343
We were just leaving, too.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.054
What am I saying? We live here.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.181
We do.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.726
We sit in the living room a lot.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.312
You guys are adorable.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.235
Have a great night.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.623
That Roy...

24:59.706 --> 25:00.707
Yeah.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.378
He really loved your dancing.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.463
Well...

25:07.964 --> 25:09.132
Why wouldn't he?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.886
I didn't even know
you could dance like that.

25:13.511 --> 25:17.682
Well, he thinks that you are
the most interesting man in the world.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.934
Well...

25:19.017 --> 25:20.393
Why wouldn't he?

25:21.853 --> 25:22.938
You are.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.900
What was that ear thing?

25:27.901 --> 25:28.860
I don't know.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.875
It actually feels kind of nice.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.171
It does.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.397
-Oh, there he is!
-Oh, God!

26:05.480 --> 26:07.899
You got a lighter?
We'll make a Molotov cocktail!

26:07.983 --> 26:09.901
Yeah, what could go wrong with that plan?

26:09.985 --> 26:12.904
Fine! Grab the fruit bowl.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.322
We'll trap him.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.075
Fast, before he figures out our plan!

26:18.368 --> 26:20.370
-Hold onto me.
-Okay.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.081
-Hold on. Hold me. Hold me tight.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.458
Ha, ha! We're gonna take you down tonight,
motherfucker.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.543
Mom?

26:31.172 --> 26:33.008
Oh, we got trouble.
