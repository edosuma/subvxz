00:02.742 --> 00:05.595
Malloy, I am highly disappointed.

00:05.596 --> 00:07.912
You don't know a thing
about the value of money.

00:07.913 --> 00:09.841
I stand by my purchase.

00:09.842 --> 00:13.478
It's not your purchase
if it's on my credit card!

00:13.479 --> 00:14.946
How much was this thing?

00:14.947 --> 00:19.927
I got it at a good
price, and I can do this.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.666
No! Aah! Why?!

00:22.722 --> 00:24.490
Why?

00:24.491 --> 00:26.659
You're gonna bankrupt me, Malloy.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.495
Return it, right now. Let's go!

00:29.496 --> 00:33.696
Fine. You'll never know it was here.

00:45.019 --> 00:47.719
<i>* Brickleberry!</i>

00:48.481 --> 00:52.171
Rangers, I finally figured out
why this Park's been losing money.

00:52.172 --> 00:53.753
Because you've been stealing it.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.956
- I didn't steal nothing.
- No one's blaming you, Denzel.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.725
Sorry. Usually, this is when
the bear says something racist.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.694
Can't, I'm playing "hate
words with friends".

01:01.695 --> 01:05.063
We are in the dumper because
this Park isn't fun anymore.

01:05.063 --> 01:08.100
There's no more good,
clean, family wholesomeness.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.851
So I bring to you...

01:10.852 --> 01:15.472
Firecracker Jim's
family fun time carnival!

01:24.123 --> 01:26.294
Takes you back to your
childhood, doesn't it?

01:26.295 --> 01:30.089
Oh, yeah, nothing says "family fun"
like catching Hep C from a carnie.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.891
That's your childhood, all right.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.627
Well, I think it's an awesome idea!

01:34.628 --> 01:37.963
Look at all these great games!

01:37.964 --> 01:40.699
Poke the rabbit in the eyeball!

01:40.700 --> 01:43.460
Donkey kicks, $5.

01:43.803 --> 01:47.573
Step right up to Bobby
Possumcods's petting zoo!

01:47.574 --> 01:50.394
Heavy petting zoo!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.713
All right, everybody, we
got a lot of work to do.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.552
Crowd control, trash duty...

01:56.553 --> 01:58.884
What the...?

01:58.885 --> 02:00.865
Look out, excuse me, move aside.

02:00.866 --> 02:02.649
Ranger Steve Williams coming through.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.690
Oh, thank God, a Park Ranger.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.291
Someone just got a skull fracture.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.726
- Who?
- You!

02:07.727 --> 02:09.695
Now get your ass to the end of the line.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.096
But I... Man.

02:12.097 --> 02:14.031
Why does the handicapped kid get to cut?

02:14.032 --> 02:15.732
Life can be so unfair.

02:15.733 --> 02:16.832
Ha, ha.

02:16.833 --> 02:22.113
Right this way for the
greatest side show on Earth!

02:22.140 --> 02:27.060
Be amazed by the
one-headed, one-tailed snake!

02:27.291 --> 02:28.813
Be astounded!

02:28.814 --> 02:32.774
By the mysterious hornless unicorn!

02:34.312 --> 02:35.846
This is lame. Let's go.

02:35.847 --> 02:37.804
Wait, who are they?

02:37.805 --> 02:39.405
Oh, don't look at them.

02:39.406 --> 02:41.585
They're just a bunch of circus freaks.

02:41.586 --> 02:43.399
But behold...

02:43.400 --> 02:46.156
A bird that has the ability...

02:46.157 --> 02:48.317
To swim!

02:49.321 --> 02:51.595
No, really, who are they?

02:51.596 --> 02:55.053
Well, if you insist on
seeing the lame stuff,

02:55.054 --> 02:58.202
here's dog boy, octopus
lady, giraffe girl, and...

02:58.203 --> 02:59.503
Whoa, let me guess.

02:59.504 --> 03:00.871
That's Dick nose.

03:00.872 --> 03:04.292
Uh, no, my name is Jerry.

03:04.407 --> 03:09.798
And my newest addition, the
carpet-munching Vaginasaurus!

03:09.799 --> 03:12.316
Hey! Connie is not a freak!

03:12.317 --> 03:16.720
Lucas, let me take your picture
with the big, ugly freak.

03:16.721 --> 03:18.422
That's not right!

03:18.423 --> 03:19.560
Don't worry.

03:19.561 --> 03:25.261
I treat each and every one
of them like my own children.

03:26.311 --> 03:29.805
Did I mention I [Bleeping]
hate my children?

03:29.806 --> 03:32.446
They need help.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.110
Come on, follow me!

03:36.184 --> 03:39.376
Oh, my God, what did she do?

03:39.377 --> 03:42.312
They can't survive in
a non-cage environment.

03:42.313 --> 03:44.381
They'll go crazy on the outside!

03:44.382 --> 03:45.777
We've got to get them back!

03:45.778 --> 03:48.606
Uh, not me. I don't associate
with anything that ugly.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.563
Yeah, unless it buys you two drinks.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.156
Then you'll give it a toothy
B.J. in a public bathroom.

03:53.157 --> 03:55.857
Did I say that?

03:58.678 --> 04:00.731
Woody, I need 20 bucks. I
want to play whack-a-mole.

04:00.732 --> 04:01.977
- No!
- Please?

04:01.978 --> 04:04.978
They use real moles.

04:07.672 --> 04:10.073
No, Malloy. Enough.

04:10.074 --> 04:12.109
What do I look like I'm made of, money?

04:12.110 --> 04:14.712
No, it looks like you're made out
of ham. Now give me some money!

04:14.713 --> 04:18.649
Forget it. You need to stop blowing
my money and make some for yourself.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.416
It's time for you to get a job.

04:20.418 --> 04:21.752
- A job?
- Yes!

04:21.753 --> 04:24.854
I'm through being your personal ATM.

04:24.855 --> 04:29.715
What does ass-to-mouth
have to do with this?

04:30.060 --> 04:33.029
Finally. I've been in
this line for three hours.

04:33.030 --> 04:35.139
Sorry, folks. Ride's closed for repair.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.216
Repair?

04:36.217 --> 04:38.602
By "repair," I mean I
snorted too much angel dust,

04:38.603 --> 04:40.982
and you'll be lucky if I
don't eat your face off!

04:40.983 --> 04:43.143
Ah, man.

04:44.408 --> 04:46.208
Oh, my God.

04:46.209 --> 04:49.145
The Paralyzer! And there's no line!

04:49.146 --> 04:51.450
Hey, Firecracker Jim.

04:51.451 --> 04:53.950
- Is this ride dangerous?
- What the hell do you think?

04:53.951 --> 04:57.220
It's called "The Paralyzer,"
not "The Blowjobber!"

04:57.221 --> 05:00.461
That line's over there!

05:01.192 --> 05:02.926
- See ya.
- Watch out, now.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.728
You never know if you gonna
have to give one or get one.

05:05.729 --> 05:10.109
Eek... uh... I think I'll do this one.

05:13.637 --> 05:15.557
Whee!

05:15.905 --> 05:17.765
Yah!

05:20.443 --> 05:22.061
Oh!

05:22.062 --> 05:24.222
Woo-hoo!

05:24.581 --> 05:26.360
Hoo-ee!

05:26.361 --> 05:28.221
Yah!

05:31.755 --> 05:34.360
Hey, you alive?

05:34.361 --> 05:36.701
No refunds.

05:39.796 --> 05:42.431
Come on, guys, in here.
You'll be safe in my cabin.

05:42.432 --> 05:44.066
You can stay as long as you want.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.668
Connie, who the hell are these freaks?

05:45.669 --> 05:48.734
They're not freaks.
They're my new best friends.

05:48.735 --> 05:50.704
Connie, you can't be
friends with these weirdos.

05:50.705 --> 05:52.808
They a bunch of...
hey, what's up, Jerry?

05:52.809 --> 05:55.612
- You guys know each other?
- Yeah, we went to Middle School together.

05:55.613 --> 05:58.331
Hey, Jerry, you remember when you
sneezed and got Wanda pregnant?

05:58.332 --> 06:02.172
I'm still paying for that cold.

06:03.521 --> 06:06.357
I come bearing sad news.

06:06.358 --> 06:10.580
As you know, Steve took a very
bad fall yesterday, and, uh,

06:10.581 --> 06:14.829
well, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, but because of his injuries, we...

06:14.830 --> 06:17.441
Well, let's just say
we lost a lot of money,

06:17.442 --> 06:19.869
because we had to shut
the carnival down early.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.170
Grieve in your own way!

06:21.171 --> 06:23.106
All right! Day off!

06:23.107 --> 06:24.949
Wait, how is Steve?

06:24.950 --> 06:26.635
Steve who? Oh!

06:26.636 --> 06:30.513
What am I, his goddamn babysitter?

06:30.514 --> 06:33.574
Good morning, Rangers.

06:34.819 --> 06:38.021
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Whoops.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.290
Aah, aah. Help me, Jesus.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.271
Sorry.

06:44.328 --> 06:45.662
Oh, look, everybody.

06:45.663 --> 06:47.446
The attention whore is here.

06:47.447 --> 06:50.000
- Woody!
- Oh, walk it off, Steve.

06:50.001 --> 06:53.570
Everything will turn out fine, just
like it did for Christopher Reeve.

06:53.571 --> 06:55.539
- But he's dead.
- Exactly.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.575
Thanks for coming to
see me in the hospital.

06:58.576 --> 07:00.678
Oh, wait. None of you did.

07:00.679 --> 07:02.079
Look on the bright side, Steve.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.082
My best friend is handicapped!
Think of all the attention I'll get.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.051
Oh, I feel terrible. Are
you gonna be okay, Steve?

07:08.052 --> 07:12.722
All questions for my client
can be directed to me.

07:12.723 --> 07:16.626
Brickleberry Park is currently
inaccessible to my handicapped client.

07:16.627 --> 07:22.332
If it is not brought up to code, you
face fines and possible litigation.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.068
What? You told me to get a job.

07:25.069 --> 07:28.227
Attorney at law? You ain't no lawyer.

07:28.228 --> 07:30.748
You're right.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.308
Now I'm a lawyer.

07:32.309 --> 07:36.149
Thank you, University of Phoenix.

07:53.518 --> 07:54.883
So, Mr. Johnson,

07:54.884 --> 07:59.496
here's how you're going to make the
Park handicap-accessible for my client.

07:59.497 --> 08:02.085
People of Earth, you are in no danger.

08:02.086 --> 08:03.961
Please remain in your homes.

08:03.962 --> 08:05.563
Ha, ha, ha.

08:05.564 --> 08:08.085
Give me that. You can
still talk, you moron.

08:08.086 --> 08:09.107
Give it back.

08:09.108 --> 08:12.248
It makes me sound smart, like
Tony Hawk, that crippled scientist.

08:12.249 --> 08:13.737
Now, let's get down to business.

08:13.738 --> 08:16.874
Lower those windows a 1/2 inch.
We need a ramp to that ramp.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.154
Therapeutic hot tub right here.

08:19.155 --> 08:21.924
And some therapeutic
hookers here, here...

08:21.925 --> 08:24.007
And here.

08:24.008 --> 08:27.262
What? Can't a brother
get some handi-scraps?

08:27.263 --> 08:29.854
Oh, I know what you're doing, Malloy.

08:29.855 --> 08:32.890
You're just getting back
at me for cutting you off.

08:32.892 --> 08:35.626
I know that Steve is
faking this whole thing.

08:35.628 --> 08:37.163
Whatever it is, I like it.

08:37.164 --> 08:38.741
You got the life, for real, Steve.

08:38.743 --> 08:40.980
Just lounging all day,
everyone taking care of you.

08:40.981 --> 08:43.220
V.I.P. treatment wherever you go.

08:43.221 --> 08:46.923
They even gave me this
never-ending bag of pudding.

08:46.924 --> 08:48.759
Steve, that's shit.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.988
Well, that's a little harsh. It's
not snack pack, but it's free.

08:51.989 --> 08:57.095
And a couple of hours after I
eat it, it fills back up again.

08:57.096 --> 08:58.205
Oh, God.

08:58.206 --> 09:02.981
Here's the total cost for completing
all the necessary upgrades to the Park.

09:02.982 --> 09:06.191
Why do I have to call a phone
number to find out how much I owe?

09:06.192 --> 09:08.596
Uh, that is not a phone
number. That is the amount due.

09:08.597 --> 09:10.896
This is a bunch of hog shit.

09:10.897 --> 09:14.317
I know you can walk, Steve,
and I'm gonna prove it!

09:14.318 --> 09:17.405
Damn, what's that smell?

09:17.406 --> 09:18.588
Yeah, what is that?

09:18.589 --> 09:21.124
It smells like a skunk
[Bleeped] a burning tire.

09:21.125 --> 09:26.525
Or your feet cooking inside
two George Foreman grills!

09:26.565 --> 09:29.900
Hmm, I don't feel anything,
but it smells delicious.

09:29.901 --> 09:33.006
Good poker face, Steve,
but I'm not buying it.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.367
Oh, that's just sad.

09:34.368 --> 09:38.010
I can't believe George Foreman put
his name on them cheap-ass grills.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.680
Look at your feet, cooked
all uneven and shit.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.716
Keep your chin up, Steve. I
know just what will cheer you up.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.989
Dancing!

09:45.990 --> 09:49.187
But I can't really
dance. Or move. At all.

09:49.188 --> 09:53.224
Steve, ever since you got paralyzed,
people let you do whatever you want.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.235
I think that that
should apply to me too.

09:55.236 --> 09:56.328
What do you mean?

09:56.329 --> 10:00.360
Hold on to your dead, lifeless ass
for a second, and let me demonstrate.

10:00.361 --> 10:01.762
Where do you think you're going?

10:01.763 --> 10:05.671
I think I'm going inside this
mother[Bleep] club, no charge, bitch.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.835
Uh, this is my best friend, Steve.

10:07.836 --> 10:09.303
He just got paralyzed.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.638
Oh, I'm so sorry. Get outta the way!

10:11.639 --> 10:13.440
This man's friend's handicapped!

10:13.441 --> 10:17.581
Look at him! He's all [Bleeped] up!

10:23.033 --> 10:24.752
What the [Bleep] do
you think you're doing?

10:24.753 --> 10:26.487
Grieving. I got a crippled friend.

10:26.488 --> 10:28.156
Oh, my bad.

10:28.157 --> 10:31.125
Here, uh, that's crap. Take
something from the top shelf.

10:31.126 --> 10:34.928
Oh, I'll take the whole top shelf.

10:34.929 --> 10:36.396
Yeah! Woo!

10:36.397 --> 10:38.632
My friend crippled! I
can do whatever I want!

10:38.633 --> 10:40.334
I'm the King of the World!

10:40.335 --> 10:42.837
Denzel, you're wasted.
Who's gonna drive home?

10:42.838 --> 10:46.438
You let me worry about that.

10:47.719 --> 10:50.211
What a night! V.I.P.!

10:50.212 --> 10:52.072
Woo!

10:52.384 --> 10:56.083
Steve, you getting paralyzed is the
best thing that ever happened to me.

10:56.084 --> 10:57.751
Denzel, this doesn't seem safe.

10:57.752 --> 10:59.386
Relax.

10:59.387 --> 11:01.322
You're doing fine.

11:01.323 --> 11:05.103
- Ah... ah...
- Gezundhe... aah!

11:05.162 --> 11:07.454
What the hell?

11:07.455 --> 11:10.490
I will kill you! I swear to God!

11:10.491 --> 11:13.534
Oh. Oh, I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

11:13.535 --> 11:16.737
We'll let it slide this time, but
don't let that shit happen again!

11:16.738 --> 11:19.207
Hey, have you guys
seen my wife anywhere?

11:19.208 --> 11:21.887
Oh, God, it hurts!

11:21.888 --> 11:24.513
Honey, shut up! It's
a handicapped driver!

11:24.514 --> 11:27.082
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.203
I feel so embarrassed.

11:32.813 --> 11:36.604
You're past due for payment on
the handicap-accessible nude beach.

11:36.605 --> 11:39.640
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me
just grab my checkbook.

11:39.641 --> 11:41.501
Aha!

11:41.710 --> 11:43.303
Nope, nothing.

11:43.304 --> 11:45.246
Okay, now do you believe he's paralyzed?

11:45.247 --> 11:49.983
No, I don't, and I'm not gonna give you
any more money for your little handi-scam.

11:49.984 --> 11:52.119
Then we will see you in court.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.287
Not if I see you first, asshole.

11:54.288 --> 11:55.989
Oh, wait, you're on my side.

11:55.990 --> 11:59.830
Sorry. I'm dying of blood loss.

12:01.819 --> 12:06.499
I've always dreamed
of having friends over.

12:08.169 --> 12:09.553
Oh!

12:09.554 --> 12:11.904
Good call. Tea's boring.

12:11.905 --> 12:15.685
Who wants to play Scattergories?

12:16.000 --> 12:20.560
Uh, so you guys want me to heat that up?

12:20.819 --> 12:24.064
So I hope you guys
saved room for dessert.

12:24.065 --> 12:26.585
Snickerdoodles?

12:28.219 --> 12:31.206
All right, everybody. Into the truck!

12:31.207 --> 12:34.999
Hey, wait a minute. You're not taking
them back to that horrible carnival.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.253
Carnival? No, this is worse.

12:38.254 --> 12:42.394
They've been summoned for jury duty.

12:43.732 --> 12:48.172
If it's a black guy, we're frying him.

12:50.081 --> 12:52.781
Best party ever.

12:56.544 --> 12:58.279
Ow! Denzel, sto...

12:58.280 --> 12:59.914
Ouch! Stop!

12:59.915 --> 13:01.370
I don't want to be here.

13:01.371 --> 13:03.718
Ah, chill out, broke
back-enroe. This is awesome.

13:03.719 --> 13:06.018
I can't believe they let me
in this all-white country club

13:06.019 --> 13:07.820
just because of your busted-ass spine.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.302
Excuse me.

13:09.303 --> 13:11.485
We have this court reserved.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.692
Well, well. Look at you.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.068
Titties like two wind
socks on a calm day.

13:17.069 --> 13:19.514
You want to get freaky
behind that dumpster?

13:19.515 --> 13:22.779
- Well, I never.
- Excuse me, that's my wife.

13:22.780 --> 13:27.100
Oh, yeah? Well, that's my best friend.

13:27.718 --> 13:29.719
Oh, yeah, you dirty.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.980
That's nice, what you're doing there.

13:38.763 --> 13:39.830
Aah!

13:39.831 --> 13:41.631
Hi.

13:41.632 --> 13:45.330
I want the truth, Steve,
because I know you're faking it.

13:45.331 --> 13:46.903
No, I'm not. I swear to God.

13:46.904 --> 13:51.640
You know, when I was in the jungle, I
did a few things I wasn't very proud of.

13:51.641 --> 13:54.943
Technically, Steven, I'm a war criminal.

13:54.944 --> 13:56.746
Gotta roll.

13:56.747 --> 13:58.742
No, Woody, what are you doing?

13:58.743 --> 14:03.485
You know, this was banned
by the Geneva Convention.

14:03.486 --> 14:07.326
Cootchy-cootchy,
wootchy-cootchy.

14:14.397 --> 14:15.831
Cootchy.

14:15.832 --> 14:17.532
You're a tough son of a bitch, Steve.

14:17.533 --> 14:20.001
I would've had Abu Nazir crying by now.

14:20.002 --> 14:23.054
Time for my last option.

14:23.055 --> 14:25.538
Oh, my God, Woody,
stop. What are you doing?

14:25.539 --> 14:29.144
Screw this court case. You're not
gonna steal any more of my money.

14:29.145 --> 14:32.281
You get up or you go down!

14:32.282 --> 14:33.778
Three...

14:33.779 --> 14:35.035
Two...

14:35.036 --> 14:37.239
Two and a half...

14:37.240 --> 14:39.520
One! Walk!

14:40.657 --> 14:41.790
Oopsie.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.458
Okay, Steve!

14:43.459 --> 14:46.339
Now I believe you!

14:54.557 --> 14:56.086
I'm still alive.

14:56.087 --> 14:59.007
I can't believe I'm still Ali... wait.

14:59.008 --> 15:01.352
Well, I'll be damned.

15:01.353 --> 15:04.293
$2 off a Subway Footlong!

15:04.294 --> 15:07.114
Oh, it's expired.

15:07.121 --> 15:11.021
Well, at least I can walk again.

15:14.189 --> 15:18.458
God damn it, how can Steve run
late when he can't even walk?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.520
Good morning, counselor.

15:20.521 --> 15:25.478
So how much money are we gonna make off
me being hurt on that roller coaster, eh?

15:25.479 --> 15:28.002
Nothing now. You can
walk? What the hell?

15:28.003 --> 15:31.663
Oh, yeah. And I can do this.

15:36.745 --> 15:38.544
Beep, beep, beep, beep
beep beep, beep beep.

15:38.545 --> 15:41.092
You had one thing to do.
You had one thing to do.

15:41.093 --> 15:43.859
Stay paralyzed. How'd
you [Bleep] that up?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.954
I know, it sucks. I've got
to wipe my own ass again.

15:46.955 --> 15:50.691
The trial's in ten minutes.
I need you to be paralyzed.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.852
Hold on.

15:53.662 --> 15:59.302
We'll never get away with
it. He looks nothing like me.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.468
Okay.

16:00.469 --> 16:02.687
Steve, sit down and don't move.

16:02.688 --> 16:04.588
You have to stay perfectly still.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.141
Do not blow this.

16:06.142 --> 16:09.210
Whoa, this guy's got a lemonade bag.

16:09.211 --> 16:11.191
Score!

16:20.715 --> 16:22.457
The litigants have been sworn in.

16:22.458 --> 16:26.425
Mr. Malloy, you and your
client are suing Woody Johnson

16:26.426 --> 16:29.873
for moneys that he owes to
complete the handicap-accessible

16:29.874 --> 16:31.934
renovations to Brickleberry Park.

16:31.935 --> 16:35.575
And for pain and suffering
caused by, and I quote...

16:35.576 --> 16:38.507
"Looking at his big,
fat, [Bleeped] up face".

16:38.508 --> 16:39.870
Objection, your honor.

16:39.871 --> 16:42.949
Let the record show that my face
is neither fat nor [Bleeped] up.

16:42.950 --> 16:47.016
Objection overruled. It is both, Sir.

16:47.017 --> 16:49.694
Now, Dr. Kuzniak, as
a medical professional,

16:49.695 --> 16:53.118
would you say that this amusement
ride could actually paralyze someone?

16:53.119 --> 16:54.460
Oh, not at all.

16:54.461 --> 16:57.158
Actually, I find The Blowjobber
to be quite stimulating.

16:57.159 --> 16:58.808
I went on it nine times.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.705
Uh, we're not here to talk
about you getting blow jobs.

17:01.706 --> 17:05.333
Wait a minute. You can get blow jobs?

17:05.334 --> 17:09.304
Denzel, as a black man, you're
familiar with illegal activities.

17:09.305 --> 17:10.939
Would you say that...

17:10.940 --> 17:13.108
Your honor, I can't continue with this.

17:13.108 --> 17:16.006
Mr. Jackson, what is going on?

17:16.007 --> 17:17.878
Oh, you know, fun.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.714
Sir, do I have to hold you in contempt?

17:20.715 --> 17:23.626
It's all right. His friend's a cripple.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.926
I'm sorry, Sir. Proceed.

17:27.858 --> 17:29.628
All right, this is
where I make Woody crack.

17:29.629 --> 17:33.642
So, Mr. Johnson, isn't it true that
you brought the carnival to Brickleberry

17:33.643 --> 17:37.234
to purposefully paralyze my client?

17:37.235 --> 17:38.069
No!

17:38.070 --> 17:42.143
So you're telling us you did not
bring the carnival to Brickleberry?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.984
- Yes.
- So now you are lying to the court.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.944
Uh, no... uh, yes... what?

17:46.945 --> 17:50.168
No, I would never do that.
I'm not that kind of guy.

17:50.169 --> 17:54.385
So you're telling this court that
you're a perfectly "decent man".

17:54.386 --> 17:58.226
And remember, you're under oath.

18:00.358 --> 18:04.027
I mean, look, I've done
bad things in my life, okay?

18:04.028 --> 18:07.064
I... oh, dear God, who am I kidding?

18:07.065 --> 18:09.133
I'm a piece of shit!

18:09.134 --> 18:14.638
When I was six, I French-kissed a burro
during a Mexican independence day parade.

18:14.639 --> 18:17.875
I illegally downloaded Mamma Mia!

18:17.876 --> 18:23.776
And in 1989, I showed my testes
to a drunk driver at an IHOP!

18:23.882 --> 18:28.185
He offered me half a rooty
tooty fresh 'n fruity!

18:28.186 --> 18:30.886
I'm only human!

18:30.955 --> 18:34.158
Mr. Malloy, what is the
point of this testimony?

18:34.159 --> 18:39.730
He had the nerve to suggest that I get
a job, and it is fun to tease the fat.

18:39.731 --> 18:40.898
Point taken.

18:40.899 --> 18:45.279
Is the aggrieved party ready to testify?

18:46.219 --> 18:49.507
We've won this, Steve. Just
sit still for five more minutes.

18:49.508 --> 18:52.076
No problem, I got this.

18:52.077 --> 18:53.798
You're the reverse Stephen Hawking...

18:53.799 --> 18:57.314
Body works, shit for brains.

18:57.315 --> 19:02.339
All ye bearded ladies and genital-nosed
freak assholes of the jury...

19:02.340 --> 19:05.388
How about a huzzah for Steve?

19:05.389 --> 19:09.892
Three cheers for the paralyzed dickhead
who's going to take all of my money!

19:09.893 --> 19:13.429
I guess you won, Steve, and
you ruined the Park forever.

19:13.430 --> 19:16.730
Con[Bleeping]gratulations.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.875
You want my money, Steve? Here, take it!

19:25.876 --> 19:27.843
Money, money, money,
money, money, money, money!

19:27.844 --> 19:30.913
You want this one, Steve? Huh?
You like it? You like Mr. Franklin?

19:30.914 --> 19:33.349
You want him? Here.

19:33.350 --> 19:36.590
Dig it out of my shit!

19:37.622 --> 19:40.827
You're getting closer.
The face is... mm...

19:40.828 --> 19:46.728
I don't know how you draw a touch of
Down's, but that's what I'm thinking.

19:52.602 --> 19:58.406
Oh, I hope you're happy,
Steve, because I'm a broken man.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.908
Oh, God! Ooh! Ooh!

19:59.909 --> 20:01.510
So itchy! Oh, oh!

20:01.511 --> 20:03.512
Oh, ooh, ah.

20:03.513 --> 20:06.033
Ah, ah. Ah...

20:07.450 --> 20:10.854
Your honor, I'd like to drop all
charges against Woody Johnson.

20:10.855 --> 20:14.590
And confide with my new
client, Woody Johnson.

20:14.591 --> 20:18.093
We will be counter suing
Mr. Steve Williams for fraud.

20:18.094 --> 20:20.434
Ah... what?

20:22.832 --> 20:26.868
Thanks for winning my money back
in that counter suit, Mr. Counselor.

20:26.869 --> 20:28.770
Here, go buy whatever you'd like.

20:28.771 --> 20:33.275
Well, this almost covers
5% of my attorney fees.

20:33.276 --> 20:35.711
Huh, The Paralyzer. I
thought they shut that ride...

20:35.712 --> 20:38.212
Ow! Oh! Steve!

20:38.213 --> 20:40.415
Shit, you dumb son of a bitch!

20:40.416 --> 20:41.883
I can't feel my legs!

20:41.884 --> 20:43.284
I can't move!

20:43.285 --> 20:46.187
Poke the cripple in the eyeball!

20:46.188 --> 20:47.688
One, please.
