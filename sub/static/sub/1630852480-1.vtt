Now it's just a hobby with me.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.417
-Well, I'd say,
from the looks of this pad,

16:15.417 --> 16:17.625
you didn't do too bad in the
filthy rich department yourself.

16:17.625 --> 16:20.208
[Lewis] Well, I've made lots of
good investments over the years.

16:20.208 --> 16:23.583
-Well, it's a real pleasure
to meet you. Sir.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.792
-My employees call me Sir.
My friends call me Lewis.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.833
-Yeah. Well, my friends
call me Lee.

16:29.833 --> 16:33.583
But a... handsome older
gentleman like yourself

16:33.583 --> 16:35.500
can call me Aileen.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.250
-You want some coffee, Aileen?

16:37.250 --> 16:38.667
-Yeah.
-Okay.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.125
-[shoes squeak]
-[Lewis gasps]

16:42.125 --> 16:43.667
-Oh, Jesus, Dad!
Are you okay?

16:43.667 --> 16:44.667
[Lewis exhales heavily]

16:44.667 --> 16:46.792
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-You okay?

16:46.792 --> 16:51.250
-This damn no-wax linoleum's
gonna be the death of me.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.708
-Yeah. Well, you can always have
them write on your tombstone,

16:53.708 --> 16:56.167
"Here's the spot
where Lewis Fell."

16:57.333 --> 17:00.042
[Lewis guffaws]

17:02.417 --> 17:04.583
-Well, I'm a happy man

17:04.583 --> 17:06.708
that you were here
to rescue me, Aileen.

17:08.541 --> 17:11.625
And I'm hopin' we're gonna see
a lot more of you around here.

17:11.625 --> 17:12.750
-Yeah, thank you.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.375
[dog barks]

17:14.375 --> 17:17.125
Ah, it was really nice
to meet you, Mr. Fell.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.833
I mean, Lewis.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.500
-"Here's the spot
where Lewis Fell."

17:22.500 --> 17:24.625
[laughs]

17:34.083 --> 17:34.792
[Jennifer] Thank you.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.542
-For what?

17:37.542 --> 17:39.333
-For making him laugh.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.542
I haven't seen him do that
in a long time.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.375
-Oh, no sweat.

17:43.375 --> 17:46.208
He just needs to lighten up,
have a little fun.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.625
-Listen, um, I don't know
what your plans are,

17:48.625 --> 17:50.583
but some of us
are gonna go shopping

17:50.583 --> 17:52.292
and maybe grab some
drinks after.

17:52.292 --> 17:53.667
-Hey, no problem.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.583
I got your drift.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.875
I'll clear out--

17:56.875 --> 17:59.417
-No, I--
I didn't mean it like that.

17:59.417 --> 18:02.375
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to come along?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.667
-Yeah, look,
you're-- you're cool.

18:06.667 --> 18:10.708
And I appreciate you lettin' me
crash here and all, but...

18:10.708 --> 18:13.750
I don't got any money
to spend at the goddamn mall.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.708
You don't gotta be
so nice to me.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.458
I'm nothing like you.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.750
-Look, I'm just
trying to be your friend.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.667
I'd really like it if you stuck
around for a while and--

18:26.667 --> 18:28.458
Well, I think my dad would too.

18:30.292 --> 18:31.583
-I gotta get my shit.

18:32.542 --> 18:33.708
Time to go.

18:34.708 --> 18:35.875
[clink of crockery]

18:35.875 --> 18:38.708
[somber music]

18:44.875 --> 18:46.500
[older Aileen] [voice-over]
I don't know what it was,

18:46.500 --> 18:49.458
but suddenly
I got this rush of...

18:49.458 --> 18:52.875
I guess you could call it
"adventure".

18:52.875 --> 18:55.500
I mean, when you got nothin',
you got nothin' to lose, right?

18:57.167 --> 18:59.167
So, I figured...

18:59.167 --> 19:01.292
what's the worst
that could happen?

19:07.792 --> 19:09.958
[Jennifer chuckles]

19:09.958 --> 19:12.000
[Mitch] Let us in, let us in.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.667
[Jennifer] Stop.
My Dad's asleep.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.833
Stop it. [chuckles]

19:15.833 --> 19:18.208
-Good.
Let's go skinny-dipping.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.750
-No, not right now, Mitch.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.708
[giggles]

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
What the...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.333
[Mitch] Jen, what's wrong?

19:40.833 --> 19:43.833
[moaning]

19:48.708 --> 19:49.667
-Oh, shit.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.875
[older Aileen] [voice-over] Did
I feel bad about what I did?

20:02.875 --> 20:04.750
Hell if I know.

20:04.750 --> 20:07.542
Besides, I'd already gone
through more shit in my life

20:07.542 --> 20:09.250
than anyone ever deserved.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.875
So, it was time
I got some payback for once.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.875
-Well, you know, I'm not
always so good with words.

20:16.667 --> 20:20.500
[sighs] But... I can only say
what I feel in my heart.

20:22.375 --> 20:26.333
Lewis, the second
I laid eyes on you,

20:26.333 --> 20:27.833
I knew you were the one for me.

20:29.708 --> 20:30.875
I love you, Lewis Fell.

20:32.708 --> 20:36.292
And, oh yeah, I can also say
these two little words.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.333
"I do."

20:41.833 --> 20:43.458
-By the power of God,

20:43.458 --> 20:45.750
and the power vested in me
by the state of Florida,

20:45.750 --> 20:48.708
I pronounce you,
Lewis Gratz Fell

20:48.708 --> 20:54.917
and Aileen Carol Wuornos,
husband and wife.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.583
You may now kiss the bride.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.583
[older Aileen] [voice-over]
Of course, they all said

21:00.583 --> 21:02.375
the marriage was doomed
from the start.

21:02.375 --> 21:05.417
But as a wise man once said,

21:05.417 --> 21:07.458
"What the hell
do they know anyway?"

21:07.458 --> 21:08.917
[Jennifer retching]

21:11.583 --> 21:14.458
[crickets chirping]

21:21.875 --> 21:24.792
-You don't have to move out
to the pool house, Jenny.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.583
This is still your home.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.667
-No, it's not, Dad.
It's yours and it's hers.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.292
Ugh, I should probably
find my own place anyway.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.750
But I promised Mom
I'd look after you,

21:37.750 --> 21:40.583
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.792
Just from a safe distance.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.875
-You know I'm always
going to love your mother,

21:44.875 --> 21:46.375
but she's gone now.

21:47.542 --> 21:49.625
Don't I deserve
a little happiness

21:49.625 --> 21:51.500
in the last years of my life?

21:51.500 --> 21:52.792
-Yeah, of course you do, Dad.

21:52.792 --> 21:55.750
But you didn't
have to marry her.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.083
[Lewis sighs]

22:12.583 --> 22:15.000
-I really hope we can
be friends again someday, Jen.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.958
-Ugh, don't bet on it.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.333
[door clicks]

22:32.500 --> 22:34.625
-I love my daughter.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.583
-Of course, you didn't, baby.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.125
You know that blood's not
always thicker than water.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.750
I'm here for you now.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.083
I always will be.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.000
Let's go to bed.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.417
[tense music]

23:47.792 --> 23:50.042
[car engine rumbles]

23:50.042 --> 23:53.000
[funky music]

24:44.042 --> 24:46.167
Double shot of Jack. Neat.

24:46.167 --> 24:47.542
-Make it two.

24:49.167 --> 24:50.125
Rough night?

24:54.208 --> 24:55.833
Come on. The least you can do
is say somethin'

24:55.833 --> 24:57.208
after I bought you a drink.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.542
-Yeah. Don't recall
askin' you to do that.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.208
-Hell, looks like you should be
buying me a drink.

25:04.208 --> 25:06.250
In fact, looks like you should
be buyin' for the whole house.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.042
-And it looks like
you should fuck off.

25:08.042 --> 25:11.667
-[scoffs] Hey,
why all this hostility, baby?

25:12.833 --> 25:14.833
-I had a real
shitty day, okay?

25:14.833 --> 25:16.542
-Well, what was
so shitty about it?

25:19.667 --> 25:20.958
-I got married.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.792
-Christ, woman!

25:23.792 --> 25:26.208
You really did have
a shitty day.

25:26.208 --> 25:29.542
Well, hey.
To the freedom we once had.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.208
[glasses clink]

25:41.750 --> 25:43.208
-Hurry it up!

25:43.208 --> 25:44.750
[Hobie] Hold your horses, woman.

25:47.292 --> 25:49.625
[Aileen sniffs]

25:49.625 --> 25:51.708
-Fuckin'-A, that's good.

25:51.708 --> 25:54.583
I needed that, man!
It's been too goddamn long!

25:54.583 --> 25:55.875
[Hobie] Then help yourself,
pretty thing.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.750
There's plenty to go around.

25:57.750 --> 26:01.000
-[sniffs] Holy shit!

26:01.000 --> 26:03.125
I'm rich! I'm fuckin' rich!

26:03.125 --> 26:04.625
Oh, fuck.

26:04.625 --> 26:05.875
I feel dizzy.

26:07.167 --> 26:08.625
Can I sit down?

26:08.625 --> 26:09.875
-Yeah, all right.
You're all right.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.750
-Damn it.
-I got you.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.125
I got you.
-What're you doing? Stop.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.208
-Oh, no, babe.
-No, no, no, no.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.917
We're just starting. Come on.

26:15.917 --> 26:17.667
-No, no. Stop.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.375
No! What're you doing, man?
I told you I'm married.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.250
-Yeah, so am I.

26:21.250 --> 26:23.625
-Stop! [gasps]

26:23.625 --> 26:26.208
-Okay, hold on, babe.
We're going for a little ride.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.625
[Aileen yells]

26:27.625 --> 26:29.375
-No, no!

26:29.375 --> 26:30.750
[Hobie grunts]

26:30.750 --> 26:33.042
[Aileen panting]

26:33.042 --> 26:34.250
[Hobie groans]

26:34.250 --> 26:35.375
-Fuck, bitch!

26:35.375 --> 26:37.083

26:39.083 --> 26:40.667
[hard punches thrown]

26:40.667 --> 26:42.250
[Hobie groans]

26:46.083 --> 26:47.208
[bouncer 1] Get that bitch off.

26:47.208 --> 26:49.292
[Hobie] God! Bitch's crazy!

26:49.292 --> 26:51.958
-Get the fuck off of me!

26:51.958 --> 26:54.167
[Dewey] Step aside, boys.
[chuckles]

26:55.917 --> 26:57.958
This one's mine.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.958
Remember me?
-[Aileen groans]

26:59.958 --> 27:02.708
[police sirens whooping]

27:02.708 --> 27:04.000
[bouncer 2]
Cops are here. Let's go.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.792
[bouncer 1] Yo, fuck this!
I'm outta here.

27:08.917 --> 27:10.708
[Aileen groans]

27:10.708 --> 27:12.292
-I didn't do shit, man!

27:12.292 --> 27:15.083
Arrest them, goddammit!

27:15.083 --> 27:16.417
They tried to rape me.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.958
[Hobie] Fuck!
This bitch is crazy.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.208
[judge] The court orders
that the charges of assault

27:22.208 --> 27:24.792
and disorderly conduct
be dropped

27:24.792 --> 27:26.208
and that the defendant
be released

27:26.208 --> 27:28.250
to the custody of her husband,
Mr. Fell.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.375
[gavel bangs]

27:29.375 --> 27:31.708
[rumble of car engine]

27:43.000 --> 27:44.958
[Lewis sighs]

27:46.417 --> 27:48.750
-I'm sorry, baby.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.333
I'm so damn sorry.

27:50.333 --> 27:51.958
I just had one drink.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.333
And then I was gonna
come right home

27:53.333 --> 27:55.167
but this asshole
started comin' on to me--

27:55.167 --> 27:57.167
-I don't want to hear it, Lee.
I really and truly don't have

27:57.167 --> 27:59.333
the patience right now.
-Oh, please don't hate me.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.167
You know, I--

28:01.167 --> 28:03.167
I just-- you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me

28:03.167 --> 28:06.292
in my whole miserable,
pathetic life.

28:06.292 --> 28:09.417
And I won't do it again.
Promise.

28:09.417 --> 28:12.208
-I wanted to
surprise you with this

28:12.208 --> 28:13.417
at breakfast this morning.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.000
But instead,
I got called downtown

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
to bail my wife out of jail.

28:28.167 --> 28:30.000
-Why the hell did you do this?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.875
-Because I happen to be proud
of the woman that I married,

28:32.875 --> 28:34.208
that's why.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.083
-I never asked you
to paint my goddamn name

28:36.083 --> 28:37.417
and face all over town.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.208
-I don't know what's
gotten into you, Aileen.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.375
I honestly don't.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.875
But I don't like it.

28:41.875 --> 28:43.333
[car door opens]

28:43.333 --> 28:45.333
-Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

28:45.333 --> 28:48.833
I just, like-- I just don't
feel like I fit in here.

28:48.833 --> 28:51.708
You know, I'm just trying to be
the best wife I can be to you.

28:53.875 --> 28:57.458
I just feel like
everyone hates me here.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.875
-It just takes time,
that's all.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.250
And no one hates you.

29:05.917 --> 29:07.167
Least of all me.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.583
[water splashes]

[door slides open, closed]

29:45.833 --> 29:48.625
-Not now, Mitch, please.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.000
-Here's an idea.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.625
Stop sulking
and go and talk to him.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.292
-No!

29:53.292 --> 29:56.083
No, I refuse to support
this sick sham of a marriage.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.875
Not now. Not ever.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.292
-So, what are you going to do?

29:59.292 --> 30:00.833
Live in exile out here
in the pool house

30:00.833 --> 30:02.292
for the next 20 years?

30:02.292 --> 30:06.000
This place wasn't exactly
built for intimacy,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.583
if you know what I mean.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.917
-Well, at least from out here,
I can keep an eye on things.

30:11.917 --> 30:13.875
Without having to be
under the same roof.

30:13.875 --> 30:16.625
-Since I've been playing
mediator between the two of you,

30:16.625 --> 30:19.042
he invited you
to go sailing with us.

30:19.042 --> 30:21.000
Grady and Dad are going,
and I think you should, too.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.167
-Me and "The Wicked Stepmother"
on an afternoon sail?

30:24.167 --> 30:28.250
Sounds delightful.
Maybe if she fell overboard.

30:29.458 --> 30:32.042
Maybe you're right.

30:32.042 --> 30:34.083
[seagulls squawking]

30:34.083 --> 30:36.375
What's that old saying?

30:36.375 --> 30:40.292
Keep your friends close.
Keep your enemies closer?

30:41.667 --> 30:43.083
[Lewis]
This is the mast.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.458
It's connected down here
to the boom.

30:45.458 --> 30:47.458
-[sings]
Boom-chick-a-boom-boom.

30:47.458 --> 30:50.083
-Oooh. [chuckles]

30:51.375 --> 30:53.958
You gotta be real careful
with the boom.

30:53.958 --> 30:55.625
Because if it's not
properly secured

30:55.625 --> 30:58.458
down here,
it'll snap like a twig and uh--

30:58.458 --> 31:00.917
-Ka-boom?

31:00.917 --> 31:04.958
-Ka-boom. [giggles]

31:04.958 --> 31:07.000
-Just grab on
right here.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.625
And this... right here.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.125
This is called...

31:14.125 --> 31:15.500
-A steering wheel?

31:15.500 --> 31:18.125
-No, my darling.
In-- in nautical parlance,

31:18.125 --> 31:21.583
it's referred to as
"the helm."

31:21.583 --> 31:27.542
-Well, then.
to helm with you. [giggles]

31:27.542 --> 31:29.542
-Beautiful day
for a sail, Commodore.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.000
-Welcome aboard.

31:33.417 --> 31:35.250
You remember Victor
from the wedding?

31:37.250 --> 31:40.625
And of course,
you know his son, Mitch.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.292
-Good to see you, again,
Aileen.

31:44.708 --> 31:47.000
-Charmed.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.667
-Fortunately for me,
Victor is a far better CPA

31:49.667 --> 31:52.667
than he is a sailor or a golfer.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.458
-Oh, you will eat those words
next weekend at the tournament,

31:55.458 --> 31:56.625
I assure you.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.667
-Hey!

31:58.667 --> 32:01.208
-Ah, the prodigal son returns.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.708
I told you 1 p.m. sharp.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.292
-Where the hell have you been?
-[Grady] Sorry, Dad.

32:04.292 --> 32:05.583
I was stuck in traffic.

32:05.583 --> 32:07.042
-That's not all
you got stuck in.

32:07.042 --> 32:10.083
[Grady and Mitch laugh]

32:10.083 --> 32:14.083
-This indolent underachiever
is my youngest son, Grady.

32:14.083 --> 32:17.458
-[scoffs]
It is such a pleasure

32:17.458 --> 32:19.292
to finally meet
the new Mrs. Fell.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.042
-Got room for one more?

32:26.333 --> 32:27.458
I hope you don't mind
if I tag along.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.750
-I have missed you.

32:30.750 --> 32:34.083
I'm so glad you decided to come.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.583
It's not the same
without my First Mate.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.250
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.292
All aboard!
-[yacht engine starts]

32:43.292 --> 32:45.792
[suspenseful music]

32:50.042 --> 32:51.792
[Older Aileen] [voice-over]
I didn't know which one

32:51.792 --> 32:54.417
was the lesser of two evils.
But one thing was for sure,

32:54.417 --> 32:57.625
I was trapped on a voyage
of the damned.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.583
And if there's one thing
that makes me sicker

32:59.583 --> 33:02.542
than phony-baloney rich folks
talkin' about themselves,

33:02.542 --> 33:04.750
it's bein' anywhere
near the water.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.667
[upbeat music]

33:25.333 --> 33:28.125
[water splashes]

34:30.667 --> 34:31.792
-I get it, I get it.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.292
-Let them win, okay?

34:33.292 --> 34:34.583
Let them win.
-I get it.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.667
Yeah, that's why
I love it with the game.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.250
[chuckles]

35:03.417 --> 35:05.250
[toilet flushes]

35:09.917 --> 35:12.542
-Long time no see, Lee.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.667
[Aileen grunting]

35:19.583 --> 35:22.625
-It's not just me, Lewis.
Everyone's talking.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.792
-Like I give a shit
what everyone thinks.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.500
-I know this isn't
what you want to hear.

35:28.500 --> 35:32.875
But as your business advisor,
mostly as your friend,

35:32.875 --> 35:35.250
I have to ask you,

35:35.250 --> 35:37.750
how much do you actually
know about this girl?

35:37.750 --> 35:39.375
-What the hell, man?

35:39.375 --> 35:40.625
That one beatin'
not enough for you?

35:40.625 --> 35:42.583
-Hey, settle down.

35:42.583 --> 35:45.250
I think we started off
on the wrong foot.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.958
Why don't we, maybe be

35:46.958 --> 35:49.292
a little more friendly
with each other?

35:49.292 --> 35:51.833
Clean the slate, so to speak.

35:51.833 --> 35:54.667
Maybe... have a little party?

35:56.625 --> 35:59.833
-I don't think so.
Now if you don't mind--

35:59.833 --> 36:01.625
[Aileen groans]
-Actually, I do mind.

36:01.625 --> 36:03.958
You got some real balls,
I'll give you that much.

36:03.958 --> 36:08.292
-All I'm asking you
is just let me check her out.

36:08.292 --> 36:11.625
If she comes up clean,
no harm done.

36:11.625 --> 36:15.333
If she doesn't,
I can make it all go away.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.375
Quietly.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.583
-Come on, bitch!
You know you want it!

36:19.583 --> 36:22.500
[Aileen groans]

36:23.583 --> 36:25.833
[boards banging]

36:29.542 --> 36:31.625
[Grady] A trash-dyke girl
like you really has--

36:31.625 --> 36:34.500
Come on, bitch!
You know you want it!

36:34.500 --> 36:38.042
-Now you needle-dicked,
mother-fucking, piece of shit,

36:38.042 --> 36:40.542
you're gonna turn
and go back out of there

36:40.542 --> 36:42.000
and tell your daddy
it's time to go

36:42.000 --> 36:44.833
and never show your face
around me again.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.583
You dig?

36:46.583 --> 36:49.458
[Grady sniffles, pisses in fear]

36:50.542 --> 36:52.583
[thuds]

36:52.583 --> 36:54.208
[door opens]

36:58.000 --> 37:03.375
-Um, Lee, are--
are you okay?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.625
-Can we go home now, baby?
Please.

37:14.625 --> 37:17.708
-What's wrong?
You don't feel good?

37:17.708 --> 37:19.625
-No. No, I don't.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.417
-Actually, Dad,
I was kind of hopin'

37:21.417 --> 37:22.750
we could get back too.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.583
I have some errands
I wanted to run in town.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.542
You know, I was thinking
that maybe Lee--

37:27.542 --> 37:29.958
Aileen, you might
want come with me?

37:33.417 --> 37:36.750
-Okay. All right.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.500
[boat engine whirring]

37:38.500 --> 37:41.417

37:43.833 --> 37:46.750
[seagulls squawking]

37:48.375 --> 37:50.292
[Mitch]
Watch your step, Dad.

37:50.292 --> 37:52.375
[church bell rings]

38:04.625 --> 38:08.958
[Jennifer] Lee!
Hey, Lee, wait up.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.625
-You didn't
have to do that.

38:11.625 --> 38:13.458
I can handle myself.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.500
-Yeah, I know you can.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.625
But listen, we gotta start
looking out for each other.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.833
Especially if you're gonna be
a part of this family.

38:23.458 --> 38:24.667
Come on.

38:25.958 --> 38:28.792
[tense music continues]

38:49.875 --> 38:52.458
-That looks
utterly sublime on you.

38:52.458 --> 38:54.125
-Oh, thank you, Courtney.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.125
I love it.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.792
-It's perfect.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.458
Your fiancé will fall
head over heels

38:58.458 --> 38:59.833
when he sees you in this dress.

38:59.833 --> 39:01.042
-We're not engaged.

39:01.042 --> 39:03.000
-Not yet. [chuckles]

39:03.000 --> 39:04.333
[Jennifer chuckles]

39:07.875 --> 39:11.500
-I love it.
Let's wrap it up.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.542
-Lee, um, you know
I wanted to buy this dress.

39:14.542 --> 39:15.917
-Oh, yeah. So, buy.

39:15.917 --> 39:18.542
Maybe we'll get
a two-for-one discount.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.792
I always dreamed of having
my own Christian Dy-er.

39:21.875 --> 39:24.417
-You mean Christian Dior?

39:27.042 --> 39:28.542
How about I go find something

39:28.542 --> 39:30.875
that might be
a better fit for you?

39:30.875 --> 39:33.792
-Excuse me?
It fits me just fine.

39:36.167 --> 39:38.042
-Okay.
Well, why don't you go change

39:38.042 --> 39:39.625
and I'll take this up front--

39:39.625 --> 39:41.542
-"Take it up to the front?"

39:41.542 --> 39:42.875
What? You think
I'm gonna steal it?

39:42.875 --> 39:45.042
-Of course not.
I wasn't suggesting anything--

39:45.042 --> 39:46.750
Yeah, maybe your mouth
wasn't suggesting it,

39:46.750 --> 39:48.542
but the look on your face
sure as hell was.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.542
-Okay. Um, you know what?
It's okay.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.500
I don't need to actually
buy anything today.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.542
I'm just gonna come back
another time.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.417
I am so sorry, Courtney.

39:58.417 --> 40:00.000
-Don't you dare
apologize for me.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.792
What, you think I'm not
good enough to shop here?

40:04.792 --> 40:06.583
Because I don't dress right?

40:06.583 --> 40:08.583
'Cause I don't look down my nose
at other people

40:08.583 --> 40:11.167
like all of you and your
goddamn Christian Dee-yore?

40:12.792 --> 40:14.833
-Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.208
-Oh, yeah. Toss the trash
out on the sidewalk.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.958
Yeah, y'all think
you're all high and mighty,

40:18.958 --> 40:20.167
but let me remind you
of somethin.'

40:20.167 --> 40:22.917
I'm married to a very rich man.

40:22.917 --> 40:26.208
And you work in a fucking shop.

40:26.208 --> 40:28.458
So, while you're sellin'
your 300-dollar dresses

40:28.458 --> 40:30.792
to these sunburned
old skeletons,

40:30.792 --> 40:32.708
why don't you do me
a big fat favor

40:32.708 --> 40:34.917
and go shove it up your ass!
-[loud thud]

40:34.917 --> 40:37.667
[Jennifer] Lee! [gasps]

40:39.917 --> 40:45.792
I am so sorry.
I'll be right back, and I will--

40:45.792 --> 40:49.458
I'll pay for everything.
I promise. I'm sorry.

40:51.125 --> 40:53.833
Lee! Lee, stop!

40:53.833 --> 40:55.833
What is wrong with you?

40:55.833 --> 40:57.875
-You took me
to this place on purpose.

40:57.875 --> 40:59.625
You set me up.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.792
-I what?

41:00.792 --> 41:01.875
I'm trying to help you.

41:01.875 --> 41:03.667
-Help me?

41:03.667 --> 41:05.750
Yeah, you can put on your little
innocent act in front of Lewis,

41:05.750 --> 41:07.000
but I know what you're up to.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.292
Now you're just like
all of 'em,

41:08.292 --> 41:10.625
just a spoiled,
stuck-up little bitch

41:10.625 --> 41:12.208
who thinks
your shit don't stink.

41:14.208 --> 41:16.917
-You know what?
Fuck you, Lee!

41:16.917 --> 41:20.792
-Yeah? Well, fuck you too!
You and all the rest of 'em.

41:20.792 --> 41:22.250
I don't need no one.

41:22.250 --> 41:24.917
[Keith breathing heavily]

41:28.083 --> 41:30.542
-Goddammit.

41:30.542 --> 41:35.083
Lee, ugh. Whatever.

[gasps] Aileen!

45:25.875 --> 45:27.833
What are you doing?

45:29.958 --> 45:32.917
-Your father doesn't like
anyone snoopin' in his office.

46:03.917 --> 46:05.167
[elevator pings]

46:05.167 --> 46:07.083
[Receptionist]
Good morning, Miss Fell.

46:21.917 --> 46:25.458
-[sighs] Well, check 237
is definitely missing.

46:25.458 --> 46:27.000
-Well, that's criminal,
isn't it?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.375
-Unfortunately, no.

46:29.375 --> 46:31.917
Immoral, maybe,
but perfectly legal.

46:31.917 --> 46:34.125
-How could she cash a check
without having the approve--?

46:34.125 --> 46:36.375
-Aileen came into the office
about a week ago.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.292
She requested a signature card.

46:38.292 --> 46:40.167
She made herself
an authorized signer

46:40.167 --> 46:41.833
on all his personal accounts.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.125
-Well then,
I want her taken off.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.417
-Not that simple, Jenny.

46:44.417 --> 46:46.958
-Why not?
I'm his sole beneficiary.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.458
My mother made sure
to give me power--

46:48.458 --> 46:50.833
-Not anymore.

I didn't want to kill Keith.

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.833
But like the others,
he had it comin'.

1:01:15.292 --> 1:01:17.375
You don't jab a rattlesnake
with a stick

1:01:17.375 --> 1:01:19.375
and expect it ain't
gonna bite you back.

1:01:21.375 --> 1:01:24.167
I just had a bit of
housekeepin' to take care of,

1:01:24.167 --> 1:01:26.750
then I'd be home-free.

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:31.000
Girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.167
[gentle music]

1:01:35.042 --> 1:01:37.458
[thunder rumbles]

1:01:49.750 --> 1:01:52.458
[suspenseful music]

1:02:02.208 --> 1:02:03.833
[Jennifer] Your father
was onto something.

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:05.875
Something big.

1:02:05.875 --> 1:02:07.792
Aileen didn't come to DeLand

1:02:07.792 --> 1:02:10.125
looking to marry
a rich older man.

1:02:10.125 --> 1:02:12.167
She came here looking
for someone else.

1:02:12.167 --> 1:02:13.083
-Who?

1:02:14.417 --> 1:02:17.042
[thunder rumbles]

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:26.167
[footsteps]

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:34.042
[Aileen] I'd like to close
these accounts, please.

1:02:36.917 --> 1:02:38.167
-All of them?

1:02:40.083 --> 1:02:43.000
-I believe I said all of them.

1:02:46.125 --> 1:02:48.292
-[cracking thunder]
-[heavy rain patters]

1:02:52.292 --> 1:02:54.917
-How y'all doin' tonight, folks?

1:02:54.917 --> 1:02:56.917
I saved you the best seat
in the house.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.875
[song playing in background]

1:03:07.125 --> 1:03:10.958
Weatherman says we're in
for a real storm tonight.

1:03:10.958 --> 1:03:14.250
Rain tears through this little
valley like a son-of-a-gun.

1:03:15.458 --> 1:03:17.542
What can I get your kids
started with?

1:03:17.542 --> 1:03:18.917
-Uh--

1:03:20.125 --> 1:03:23.125
you're a lot younger
than I expected.

1:03:23.125 --> 1:03:24.917
-What do you mean
by that, dear?

1:03:24.917 --> 1:03:26.500
-Your name is Diane.

1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:27.458
[Diane] Yeah.

1:03:27.458 --> 1:03:29.917
-Diane Pittman?

1:03:29.917 --> 1:03:31.875
-I, um, believe
you have me mistaken

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:33.125
for someone else.

1:03:33.125 --> 1:03:35.583
My last name is Spool.

1:03:35.583 --> 1:03:37.958
I'll be back when you've had
a chance to look at the menus.

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:42.000
-I know where your daughter is.

1:03:46.542 --> 1:03:48.500
Your daughter is Aileen.

1:03:50.542 --> 1:03:53.917
-[thunder rumbles]
-[heavy rain pouring]

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:55.958
[Diane] How the hell
in the world did you find me?

1:03:55.958 --> 1:03:59.083
I haven't gone by Pittman
in over 20 years.

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:02.625
-We didn't. My father did.

1:04:02.625 --> 1:04:05.583
And now, he and my brother
are missing.

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.167
[Diane] I don't know
what I can do for you.

1:04:08.167 --> 1:04:10.042
I married at 14.

1:04:11.583 --> 1:04:15.500
Aileen, "Little Lee,"
as I used to call her,

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:17.208
never met her real daddy.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.375
He was a very violent man.

1:04:22.375 --> 1:04:26.125
He was put away for crimes
against children.

1:04:28.917 --> 1:04:31.542
He ended up hangin' himself
in his prison cell.

1:04:34.292 --> 1:04:37.000
I didn't have the means
to care for two children.

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.333
So I thought it would be better

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:40.542
if I left them
in the care of my parents.

1:04:40.542 --> 1:04:43.000
-Yeah, she told me
all about her grandparents.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.542
How-how they abused her,
violated her.

1:04:46.542 --> 1:04:48.042
Heck, they put her
out on the street

1:04:48.042 --> 1:04:50.083
when she was just 12 years old.

1:04:52.042 --> 1:04:58.292
-She is a liar,
and a very dangerous liar.

1:04:58.292 --> 1:05:02.458
She does not have a conscience
like other people.

1:05:02.458 --> 1:05:04.208
Like her daddy,

1:05:04.208 --> 1:05:08.333
she lives in a constant state
of paranoid delusion.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:09.958
[approaching footsteps]

1:05:09.958 --> 1:05:12.667
She manipulates, she controls,

1:05:12.667 --> 1:05:15.125
she takes whatever she wants.

1:05:17.208 --> 1:05:19.250
And once she is done with you.

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:23.958
she kills.

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:26.625
[loud crack of thunder]

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:32.542
[suspenseful music]

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:39.458
[thunder rumbles]

1:05:43.500 --> 1:05:44.417
[door bangs shut]

1:05:50.125 --> 1:05:53.042
[thunder rumbles]

1:05:54.125 --> 1:05:57.042
[footsteps]

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.667
[suspenseful music]

1:06:21.167 --> 1:06:22.792
[rumbling thunder]

1:06:22.792 --> 1:06:26.000
[steady footsteps]

1:06:32.667 --> 1:06:34.500
-Aileen, it's time
we have a talk.

1:06:37.333 --> 1:06:38.500
-About what, baby?

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.042
-About everything.

1:06:42.333 --> 1:06:43.500
About who you are.

1:06:45.333 --> 1:06:47.042
And what you've done.

1:06:47.042 --> 1:06:48.500
-You're not
thinkin' clear, baby.

1:06:50.625 --> 1:06:52.083
It was Jennifer.

1:06:53.458 --> 1:06:56.458
She's been tellin' you
more lies about me.

1:06:56.458 --> 1:06:58.167
She's trying to make it seem
like I'm the one--

1:06:58.167 --> 1:06:59.667
-[shouts]
Stop it. Aileen!

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.042
You stop it right now!

1:07:06.042 --> 1:07:10.083
I want you
to explain this to me.

1:07:12.208 --> 1:07:13.583
Explain what you've done.

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:15.375
[loud clatter]

1:07:17.292 --> 1:07:21.792
The bank called me an hour ago.

1:07:21.792 --> 1:07:25.500
They told me you took it all.
Every last cent.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:27.292
-I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:07:29.083 --> 1:07:30.375
You've got it all wrong.

1:07:30.375 --> 1:07:33.542
-Jennifer told me
what you were up to.

1:07:33.542 --> 1:07:35.375
What Victor already figured out.

1:07:37.708 --> 1:07:40.042
So we went to the bank
this morning, and...

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:44.875
we moved the money
to other accounts.

1:07:44.875 --> 1:07:50.375
What you stole,
it's only a drop in the bucket

1:07:50.375 --> 1:07:52.625
compared to what
I'm really worth.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:56.833
Do you think I'm...

1:07:56.833 --> 1:08:01.708
just some tired,
feeble old fool

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:07.250
who doesn't see what's
happening under his own roof?

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:09.583
-Baby, don't you see?

1:08:09.583 --> 1:08:12.542
Jennifer hates me
for comin' into your life.

1:08:12.542 --> 1:08:14.458
for bein' the woman
that took you away from her.

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:19.416
-No woman will ever
take me away from my daughter.

1:08:22.666 --> 1:08:24.250
I know what you did.

1:08:25.708 --> 1:08:29.500
Now I know who and what you are.

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:33.416
And I'm calling the police.

1:08:33.416 --> 1:08:34.666
[telephone clicks]

1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:37.291
[telephone clanks]

1:08:37.291 --> 1:08:40.666
-You had your chance
with me, Lewis.

1:08:40.666 --> 1:08:44.875
I gave you my youth,
my looks, my body.

1:08:44.875 --> 1:08:46.875
But everything comes
with a price.

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:50.541
And now you gotta pay.

1:08:54.625 --> 1:08:55.791
-You get out of my way.

1:08:57.708 --> 1:09:00.625
[dramatic music]

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:09.541
-Where you goin', baby?

1:09:09.541 --> 1:09:11.541
-I want you out of my home!

1:09:11.541 --> 1:09:13.333
I want you out of my life!

1:09:13.333 --> 1:09:15.666
-Aw, just when we were having
so much fun.

1:09:15.666 --> 1:09:16.666
[Aileen grunts]

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:26.375
[Lewis groans]

1:09:28.666 --> 1:09:31.916
[Lewis panting with effort]

1:09:38.666 --> 1:09:39.958
[Lewis grunts]

1:09:39.958 --> 1:09:40.958
[Aileen grunts]

1:09:40.958 --> 1:09:42.666
[Lewis screams]

1:09:45.458 --> 1:09:48.166

-[Lewis groans]

1:09:58.708 --> 1:10:01.500
[panting]

1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:04.666
-That's the spot
where Lewis Fell.

1:10:04.666 --> 1:10:07.708
[panting]

1:10:07.708 --> 1:10:10.750
-[loud peals of thunder]
-[heavy downpour]

1:10:13.541 --> 1:10:16.416
[suspenseful music]

1:10:33.333 --> 1:10:34.666
-That gate's not working.

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:37.791
-Looks like the power's out.

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:41.916
-We're gonna
have to make a run for it.

1:10:41.916 --> 1:10:43.000
-Okay.
-Come on.

1:10:46.416 --> 1:10:49.291
[dramatic music]

1:11:00.583 --> 1:11:03.416
-Dad? Dad, are you home?

1:11:05.750 --> 1:11:07.791
[clicks the light switch]

1:11:07.791 --> 1:11:09.750
-The storm could have
knocked out the power lines.

1:11:09.750 --> 1:11:10.833
I'll try the fuse box.

1:11:12.916 --> 1:11:15.625
-[booms of thunder]
-[sharp footsteps]

1:11:18.708 --> 1:11:21.625
[♪♪♪]

1:11:29.125 --> 1:11:30.791
[Jennifer] [cries] No.

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:33.041
Daddy, no, no, no!
Please, Daddy, no, no, no, no!

1:11:33.041 --> 1:11:34.583
Daddy, please, please! Daddy!

1:11:34.583 --> 1:11:36.708
[screaming]
Mitch! Mitch, help me.

1:11:36.708 --> 1:11:39.083
Daddy, please.
-Oh, my God.

1:11:39.083 --> 1:11:41.041
-Where do you think
you're taking my husband?

1:11:41.041 --> 1:11:43.333
-You fucking bitch!

1:11:43.333 --> 1:11:45.333
What did you do to him?

1:11:45.333 --> 1:11:46.458
-What did I do?

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:49.791
I think the question
the police are gonna ask is,

1:11:49.791 --> 1:11:51.416
"What did you do?"

1:11:51.416 --> 1:11:53.458
-No. They'll never believe you.
I-I have evidence.

1:11:53.458 --> 1:11:55.666
Evidence that proves
who you really are.

1:11:55.666 --> 1:11:57.500
-Oh, yeah?

1:11:57.500 --> 1:11:59.833
You mean that little file
Victor put together on me?

1:12:01.833 --> 1:12:03.500
Yeah, I took care of it already.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:06.875
Took care of him...

1:12:06.875 --> 1:12:09.708
and your rapist
pig of a brother too.

1:12:09.708 --> 1:12:10.916
-Fuck you!
-[Aileen groans]

1:12:10.916 --> 1:12:13.666
[loud thunderclap]

1:12:13.666 --> 1:12:15.916
[Jennifer] Here, help me.
Help me. We gotta get him up.

1:12:15.916 --> 1:12:16.916
[Mitch] One,

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:18.041
two,

1:12:18.041 --> 1:12:21.166
three.
-[Lewis grunts]

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:22.666
-[Jennifer] Let's go.
-[Mitch] Okay, come on.

1:12:22.666 --> 1:12:24.000
Let's go. Come on.
-[Jennifer] You got it.

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.666
-[Lewis groans]
-Watch your step.

1:12:26.666 --> 1:12:27.958
-[Jennifer] Be careful.

1:12:29.416 --> 1:12:31.666
You'll be okay, Lewis.

1:12:31.666 --> 1:12:32.750
We're gonna get you out of here.

1:12:35.541 --> 1:12:37.166
All right, come on.
Just a little bit farther.

1:12:37.166 --> 1:12:38.625
-[Jennifer] Hang on, Dad.
Please hang on.

1:12:40.625 --> 1:12:42.458
-[Mitch] This way.
-Get him to the hospital.

1:12:42.458 --> 1:12:44.541
I'll deal with Aileen.
-No!

1:12:44.541 --> 1:12:46.625
I am not leaving here
without you.

1:12:46.625 --> 1:12:48.708
-Goddammit, Mitch!
Get him outta here!

1:12:48.708 --> 1:12:50.541
Just go! Now!

-Take my hand.

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:39.625
Lee, here.

1:14:39.625 --> 1:14:41.000
Reach.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.208
[Aileen] I can't.
