Approaching the west side

Sergeant Liu, actually.

Military Police Corps.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.490
I was there
when you were arrested

02:22.533 --> 02:24.144
on conspiracy to commit murder.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.841
See?

02:25.884 --> 02:27.886
You remember. I didn't realize

02:27.930 --> 02:29.279
we had a breakfast on the books.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.890
Otherwise, I would have asked
for a rain check.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.415
I'm sorry, this is
so spontaneous, but...

02:34.458 --> 02:36.330
I wanted to share
some news with you.

02:36.373 --> 02:40.551
Someone planted a bomb
at Commander McGarrett's house.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.727
Well, that's terrible.Mmm.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.164
Is he okay?

02:44.207 --> 02:45.556
McGarrett? Oh, he's fine.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.037
I mean, it helps
that whoever did it was, uh...

02:48.080 --> 02:49.604
What is that word?

02:49.647 --> 02:51.432
Incompetent.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.434
See, McGarrett has this dog.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.131
I mean, he's no ordinary mutt.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.307
He used to hunt IEDs
for the Marines.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.285
So he just sniffed that bomb out
with no problems.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.790
Well, that's a relief.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.183
Do you have any suspects?

03:06.142 --> 03:08.362
Ah. That's funny.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.842
Because, once again, I have
a feeling that y-you don't have

03:10.886 --> 03:13.932
any evidence to back up
that slanderous allegation.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.388
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be sitting here,

03:15.412 --> 03:18.328
enjoying this delicious
breakfast with you.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.200
You know what?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.592
You're right.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.422
This is delicious.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.815
Well...

03:28.556 --> 03:30.011
Sergeant Liu, thank you
for coming all this way

03:30.035 --> 03:31.428
to update me in person.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.276
Nice as this chat has been,
I can't help but think

03:33.300 --> 03:35.234
you'd be better off spending
your time looking for the person

03:35.258 --> 03:37.304
who's actually responsible
for planting that bomb.

03:37.347 --> 03:40.132
Mmm. Can I share
something with you?

03:40.176 --> 03:42.570
I'm one of those, uh,
clingy types.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.312
Hmm.
And once I'm
interested in somebody,

03:45.355 --> 03:47.792
I can't let go.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.404
So, basically,
what I'm telling you is,

03:50.447 --> 03:52.928
you will be seeing
a lot more of me.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.234
And Commander McGarrett.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.279
And the rest of the Five-O team,
for that matter.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.977
So we are gonna be
all up in your business 24/7.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.502
Lucky me.Yeah.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.941
Well, when that luck runs out,

04:05.984 --> 04:08.509
we're gonna be there
to take you down.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.601
One for the road?

04:14.906 --> 04:17.168
We'll catch you later.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.440
Breakfast is served.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.703
Hey. Thanks.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.228
Good job in there.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.814
Sounds like you really
got under his skin.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.536
Yeah. It's a talent I have.Well...

04:36.624 --> 04:38.016
This is an excellent croissant.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.105
Oh, you should have seen
his face when I dug

04:40.149 --> 04:41.150
into his bread basket.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.717
Totally triggered him.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.458
Yeah, it did.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.676
He's making a call.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.983
Hey. I got a job for you.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.115
Yeah, usual spot.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.595
An hour.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.119
All right, let's see who
Cullen's setting up a meet with.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.124
Look at that. It's a burner.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.822
Well, that's a surprise.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.389
So, what's next?

05:04.216 --> 05:06.349
It's a good thing you
got the day off work.

05:06.393 --> 05:10.005
This stakeout just officially
turned into a tail.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.534
Do you think this plan
of McGarrett's is gonna work?

05:17.578 --> 05:19.362
Hell, I don't know.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.060
I know one thing: you ever try
to talk Steve McGarrett

05:22.104 --> 05:24.715
out of a plan... any plan,
no matter how damn crazy it is...

05:24.759 --> 05:26.151
Is a losing proposition.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.675
Yes, true,

05:27.718 --> 05:30.242
but, you know, it's like that
saying about pulling a lion

05:30.286 --> 05:31.896
by the tail.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.986
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that sound
like something you just made up.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.573
All right. Well, you understand
what I'm saying.

05:36.597 --> 05:37.946
Annoying the enemy

05:37.989 --> 05:39.576
in the hopes that he might do
something irrational,

05:39.600 --> 05:41.602
that's-that's a bold move,

05:41.645 --> 05:44.909
especially when that irrational
thing might be eating you.

05:44.953 --> 05:48.522
Or, just setting aside
the lion analogy for one moment,

05:48.565 --> 05:50.393
blowing up your house again.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.441
Are-are you... are you okay?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.356
'Cause you seem a little...

05:56.399 --> 05:59.359
And please don't take this
the wrong way, but cranky.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.925
Oh, no, that's the right way.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.927
So, is the apartment search
not going well?

06:02.971 --> 06:04.146
Hell no.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.428
Matter of fact, I'm starting to

06:05.452 --> 06:07.454
get the idea
that I got a better chance

06:07.497 --> 06:08.977
of getting a selfie with Bigfoot

06:09.020 --> 06:11.806
than getting an apartment
in our price range.

06:13.677 --> 06:17.333
Victim's name is Jay Kahale, 38.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.640
According to records, he was
a demo diver in the Navy

06:19.683 --> 06:23.426
until five years ago when he
switched to private sector work.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.254
He was found
down 180 feet underwater

06:25.297 --> 06:27.430
inside the wrecked fuselage
of a plane.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.823
Oh, you mean that wreck

06:28.866 --> 06:31.129
that they, uh,
found near, uh, Pupukea?

06:31.173 --> 06:32.479
I saw that on the news. That?

06:32.522 --> 06:34.219
Yeah, well, that's
probably where Kahale

06:34.263 --> 06:35.656
heard about the wreck, too.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.571
Because, according to
the diving company,

06:37.614 --> 06:39.834
he wasn't a member
of their salvage team.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.271
They're thinking he just
decided to take a sneak peak

06:42.314 --> 06:44.510
before it was brought up to the surface.
TANI: Well, based on the hole

06:44.534 --> 06:46.854
in his head, I'm guessing he
didn't just run out of oxygen.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.451
Correct.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.671
C.O.D. was
a single .357 Magnum round

06:50.714 --> 06:52.324
through the back of the head.

06:52.368 --> 06:53.500
Hang on a second.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.850
I realize the .357
is a powerful iron,

06:55.893 --> 06:59.288
but last I checked,
you can't fire one underwater.

06:59.331 --> 07:03.161
No. The official murder weapon
was a powerhead.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.337
A what?
Oh, a bang stick.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.209
It's a specialized firearm

07:07.252 --> 07:08.297
used by divers

07:08.340 --> 07:10.691
to fend off sharks.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.054
And because the density of water
is approximately 800 times

07:13.084 --> 07:16.131
that of air at sea level,
the device needs to be fired

07:16.174 --> 07:17.828
while in contact
with the target.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.352
Which means our killer
had to be close enough

07:20.396 --> 07:22.442
to press it into the back
of our vic's head.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.792
So, looks like our killer
was very, very sneaky

07:24.835 --> 07:27.490
and was able to come up
behind him undetected.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.057
Right.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.452
Try this: the two of them
were diving this wreck together.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.542
The killer decides to stick it
to Kahale when he's not looking,

07:35.585 --> 07:37.239
left him there for fish food.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.241
Mm-hmm, well,
that explains the how.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.331
Doesn't explain the why.Yeah.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.465
What the hell could've been
on this plane

07:45.508 --> 07:47.336
worth killing for?

07:53.690 --> 07:54.952
A decades-long mystery

07:54.996 --> 07:56.650
may soon be solved.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.087
Today, a research team
has announced the discovery

07:59.130 --> 08:01.655
of Flight 912,
the commercial plane

08:01.698 --> 08:05.049
that crashed
over the Pacific in 1983.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.356
It'll be several days
before the plane

08:07.399 --> 08:09.358
is dredged up
and returned to Hawaii.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.707
In the meantime,

08:10.751 --> 08:12.361
federal investigators
are awaiting

08:12.404 --> 08:15.364
the recovery
of the plane's black box,

08:15.407 --> 08:19.673
hoping it will finally explain
what caused Flight 912 to crash

08:19.716 --> 08:21.892
more than 36 years ago.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.286
This report aired
the day of the discovery,

08:24.329 --> 08:26.549
so the research team
had already ordered

08:26.593 --> 08:28.986
the deep-dive recovery equipment
from the mainland,

08:29.030 --> 08:30.901
and it's due
to arrive later today.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.662
Which means three days
passed from the announcement

08:32.686 --> 08:34.078
of the plane being discovered

08:34.121 --> 08:36.341
to our vic's body being
found early this morning.

08:36.385 --> 08:40.083
So, Kahale had a 72-hour window
to dive down to that plane

08:40.128 --> 08:41.650
before it was
going to be dredged up.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.434
What the hell
was he doing down there?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.046
I don't know, but wreck diving

08:45.089 --> 08:47.111
is pretty risky, especially
in confined spaces like that.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.703
Which is why it's almost
always done in teams.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.419
Well, that supports our theory
that Kahale's killer

08:51.443 --> 08:52.706
was his dive partner.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.577
Check this out.
Our vic's phone was turned on

08:54.621 --> 08:56.536
a couple hours after T.O.D.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.494
It pinged off
a tower in Haleiwa.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.322
HPD canvassed the area and found

09:00.365 --> 09:02.933
a burnt-out boat
registered to our vic.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.326
CSU is processing it now.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.545
So the killer uses

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
the victim's boat
to get back to shore

09:07.634 --> 09:11.159
and then torches it to destroy
any incriminating evidence?

09:11.202 --> 09:13.378
Certainly confirms
that they were working together.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.487
Right. But why power on Kahale's
phone after killing him?

09:15.511 --> 09:17.121
Okay.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.515
So, we know this was
at least a two-man job.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.691
We also know that our killer's
an experienced diver,

09:21.735 --> 09:23.475
so let's look into the vic.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.869
His phone records, employment
records, the whole shebang.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.306
Let's see if we can figure out
who he was diving with.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.893
All right, you got it. In the meantime,

09:29.917 --> 09:31.222
you, with me.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.442
We need to learn more
about this plane crash.

09:45.715 --> 09:48.413
I guess it is true
what they say.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.329
You can tell a lot about
a person by how they drive.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.438
All right, first of all,
this is a pursuit, all right?

09:53.462 --> 09:54.724
So normal rules of the road,

09:54.768 --> 09:56.508
they don't apply.
Second of all, last time

09:56.552 --> 09:58.472
we were in this position,
you were criticizing me

09:58.510 --> 09:59.860
for not driving
recklessly enough.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.776
Actually, I was referring
to our friend, Mr. Cullen.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.256
Okay.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.607
But now that I know
what triggers you...

10:07.650 --> 10:08.782
All right.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.961
Hello?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.541
Everything all right?

10:29.585 --> 10:31.021
Yeah, it's nothing.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.632
You speak Kurdish.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.025
Not according to my translator,
but yeah.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.461
You?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.550
No.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.554
Looks like this is the stop.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.570
Well, if you want
plenty of photos

10:58.614 --> 11:01.138
of Cullen sitting in his car,
I got you covered.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.186
Hey, yo, here's his boy.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.639
Are they just enjoying
each other's company?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.859
Why aren't they talking?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.821
They're smart.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
This is the airport.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.608
Even if we had
a directional mic,

11:36.652 --> 11:38.532
we wouldn't pick any of
this up from this range.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.875
Well, you don't go
through that much trouble

11:41.918 --> 11:43.311
to hide what you're
talking about

11:43.354 --> 11:45.226
unless it's about
something illegal. I agree.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.755
Okay.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.889
I'll get these over to Adam,

11:55.932 --> 11:57.978
see if he can identify
Cullen's friend.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.633
While you're at it,
have Adam put

12:01.677 --> 12:02.765
an HPD detail on Cullen.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.680
We'll follow his boy,

12:04.724 --> 12:07.596
see what he's been tasked to do.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.923
At first, we all thought

12:29.966 --> 12:31.315
the flight was delayed.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.100
But then someone
from the airline

12:33.143 --> 12:34.797
gathered us all into a room.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.626
That's when I learned
that the plane had crashed

12:37.669 --> 12:42.065
and that my, uh... my brother

12:42.109 --> 12:45.677
and 156 other people were dead.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.030
We're sorry for your loss.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.295
Mr. Ennis, we understand that
you're something of an authority

12:54.338 --> 12:56.079
when it comes to Flight 912.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.212
You've been keeping the
victims' families up to date

12:58.255 --> 13:00.344
with various search
and recovery missions.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.912
A lot of people chose
to move on.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.524
I don't blame them
for that, but, uh...

13:06.568 --> 13:08.265
I never gave up hope.

13:08.309 --> 13:12.226
And now I will finally be able

13:12.269 --> 13:14.576
to lay Ron's body to rest.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.275
Well, Mr. Ennis,
it seems that the crash

13:18.319 --> 13:20.582
has, uh, taken one more victim.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.889
We're actually investigating
the murder of a diver

13:22.932 --> 13:26.849
whose body was found in
that wreckage this morning.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.503
Apparently,
he and his dive partner

13:28.546 --> 13:31.158
had gone down there
poking around,

13:31.201 --> 13:32.246
looking for something.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.030
Any idea what that
might have been?

13:34.074 --> 13:36.772
Uh, yeah, I mean,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.382
what everyone's looking for.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.907
Answers.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.780
The NTSB called off
their search in 1986,

13:44.824 --> 13:48.088
but privately funded groups
have continued looking for it,

13:48.131 --> 13:51.265
because still,
after all these years,

13:51.308 --> 13:53.876
no one knows why 912 crashed.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.270
If it was mechanical error,

13:56.313 --> 13:59.621
why did it crash five hours
into a six-hour flight?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.231
If there was engine failure,

14:01.275 --> 14:03.712
why didn't the pilot report it?

14:03.755 --> 14:05.496
So, if this was about answers,

14:05.540 --> 14:07.847
then why do you think
someone would dive down there?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.718
Why wouldn't they wait
till the plane was

14:09.761 --> 14:11.502
dredged up and inspected?

14:11.546 --> 14:13.548
Because a lot of folks believe

14:13.591 --> 14:15.680
that the truth will
never come out.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.118
That it will be covered up.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.077
Covered up by who?

14:21.121 --> 14:22.862
Take your pick.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.430
There have always been people
with crazy ideas

14:26.474 --> 14:28.171
about why 912 went down.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.062
You know what, spend five
minutes on the Internet.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.392
You'll see.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.960
The conspiracy theories
are out of control.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.092
So, I did a deep dive

14:36.136 --> 14:38.181
into the Flight 912
message boards,

14:38.225 --> 14:41.141
and let's just say
the Internet can be

14:41.184 --> 14:43.099
a very dark place.
What?!

14:43.143 --> 14:46.059
You mean it's not all cat videos
and Keanu Reeves memes?

14:46.102 --> 14:47.930
Plenty of that,
but there's also no shortage

14:47.974 --> 14:49.690
of conspiracy theories
surrounding the crash.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.281
Mm-hmm. For instance,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.675
a lot of people think
the manufacturer has been

14:53.718 --> 14:56.286
covering up a mechanical defect
that took the plane down.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.201
Well, that doesn't seem
so out there.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.421
Well, then there are those
who believe the plane

15:00.464 --> 15:02.858
went through a wormhole and
passed into another dimension.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.425
Yep, there's a crazy.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.775
But the most widely
circulated theory by far

15:06.818 --> 15:09.821
involves the Star Wars
defense project.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.607
Oh, yeah, back in the '80s.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.450
The government was talking about
us being able

15:14.478 --> 15:16.132
to take out Russian nukes
with lasers

15:16.176 --> 15:18.091
fired from outer space.Exactly. Yes.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.528
But I bet you didn't know
the Star Wars program

15:20.571 --> 15:22.399
has close ties to Hawaii.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.271
I did not know that.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.056
The Pacific Missile Range
Facility on Kauai

15:27.100 --> 15:30.755
was at the center of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.932
It's where most of the
Star Wars testing took place.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.326
So the theory goes
that, back in 1983,

15:36.370 --> 15:38.111
an early test to
take down a missile

15:38.154 --> 15:41.157
resulted in the accidental
downing of Flight 912.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.726
Now, some conspiracy theorists
think the reason the wreckage

15:44.769 --> 15:47.947
was never found is because
the military got to it first

15:47.990 --> 15:48.991
and buried the discovery.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.601
Well, we know that's not true,

15:50.645 --> 15:52.275
because the plane was
discovered three days ago

15:52.299 --> 15:53.691
by a private research group.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.738
Sure. The plane was.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.871
Hear me out.
Is it possible

15:59.915 --> 16:01.743
the military sent someone down

16:01.786 --> 16:04.746
to retrieve incriminating
evidence before the wreckage

16:04.789 --> 16:06.574
was brought to the surface?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.880
I don't know.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.273
You look different, Jerry.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.406
Ah!
You shaved your beard.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.451
Look, hey, no.
Come on.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.758
Listen, Jay Kahale
was former Navy.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.978
Maybe the military went
off-books for this.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.588
All right,
outsourced the job to someone

16:20.631 --> 16:21.782
who would provide
plausible deniability.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.112
No!

16:23.156 --> 16:26.333
I cannot wrap my head around
the United Stated Navy

16:26.376 --> 16:28.596
engaging in a coverup
just to bury the cause

16:28.639 --> 16:30.424
of some airplane
that went down, what,

16:30.467 --> 16:32.078
like, 30 years ago? Uh-uh.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.408
Hey, Joons, you're on
speakerphone with everybody.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.868
What's up?

16:39.911 --> 16:41.933
So I dumped Kahale's phone
and was able to track down

16:41.957 --> 16:43.828
several divers
he had been in contact with

16:43.872 --> 16:45.178
over the last few days.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.006
Uh, one of them told me
that Kahale

16:47.049 --> 16:48.529
had contacted him about a job.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.618
Apparently, he has a client
who was willing to pay

16:50.661 --> 16:52.533
a lot of money for them
to recover something

16:52.576 --> 16:54.361
off of a wreck,
no questions asked.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.797
Did Kahale say what it was

16:55.840 --> 16:56.861
they were supposed to recover?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.104
My guy asked,

16:58.147 --> 16:59.211
and when Kahale
wouldn't tell him,

16:59.235 --> 17:00.671
he passed on the job.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.586
But he was offered 30 grand
for one day's work,

17:02.630 --> 17:04.414
so it's got to be something
pretty valuable.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.415
That's a lot of money,

17:06.460 --> 17:08.679
but he was smart
to turn that job down.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.984
It sounds sketchy as hell.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.813
But someone did take
Kahale's offer.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.728
Someone who did the math
and figured out

17:13.771 --> 17:16.339
they'd be better off cutting him
out of the deal entirely.Yeah.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.906
So they murder Kahale, and then
reach out to his contact

17:18.950 --> 17:20.300
to renegotiate the deal.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.104
That could explain why
Kahale's phone was turned on

17:22.127 --> 17:24.608
a couple hours after
his confirmed T.O.D.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.609
The killer would have
needed that number.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.002
Guys, there's something else.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.961
Apparently, Kahale was
very clear that he needed

17:30.005 --> 17:32.834
a diver who specialized
in underwater welding.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.183
There's one obvious reason

17:34.227 --> 17:36.838
Kahale would need a diver
with welding skills.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.840
To find the black box.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.494
It's definitely one way
to ensure that

17:40.537 --> 17:42.626
the cause of the crash
was never discovered.

17:42.670 --> 17:46.152
Still think that theory
is so, uh, crazy?

18:23.014 --> 18:26.322
What are the odds these guys are
just off for a weekend getaway?

18:26.366 --> 18:28.977
They don't look like
weekend bags to me.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.938
Adam, what you got?

18:33.982 --> 18:35.679
Oh, straight to the point.
I like that.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.507
I ran the photos you sent over.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.901
Facial rec got a hit on the guy
Cullen was meeting with.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.381
I just e-mailed you his jacket.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.948
Why am I not surprised
he has one?

18:48.953 --> 18:50.738
Sam Bishop.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.019
Boy, he's really
racked 'em up, hasn't he?

18:52.043 --> 18:53.958
"Criminal trespassing,
aggravated assault,

18:54.002 --> 18:55.699
attempted murder."

18:55.743 --> 18:57.199
Well, based on his résumé,
I'm guessing Cullen didn't

18:57.223 --> 18:59.399
hire him because of
his proficiency in Excel.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.898
Appreciate your help
with this one, Adam.

19:00.922 --> 19:01.879
How's your case going?

19:01.923 --> 19:03.490
It's a weird one, for sure.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.666
Started with a dead diver,
now it seems his murder

19:05.709 --> 19:08.408
might be tied to the coverup
of a plane crash

19:08.451 --> 19:09.583
from the '80s.

19:09.626 --> 19:10.734
Looks like you picked a good day

19:10.758 --> 19:11.759
to be out of the office.

19:11.802 --> 19:12.934
Good luck with that, buddy.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.433
Hey, listen, thanks again.
Keep us posted,

19:14.457 --> 19:16.677
all right? Anytime.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.940
So Cullen, who's already tried
to murder you once,

19:18.983 --> 19:20.724
responds to being provoked

19:20.768 --> 19:21.875
by reaching out to this peach

19:21.899 --> 19:23.597
with attempted murder
in his jacket.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.444
Who then proceeds to pick up
four scary-looking dudes

19:25.468 --> 19:27.209
with gear bags.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.993
Just a wild stab here,

19:29.037 --> 19:30.734
but if I had to guess,
I'd say that

19:30.778 --> 19:32.562
their next stop
is gonna be your place,

19:32.606 --> 19:34.608
because they're going to
go there to kill you.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.181
Let's see if you're right
about that.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.360
Wow, Mr. Pollock, you
look surprisingly normal.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.884
Where's your little tinfoil hat?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.799
Come on, I feel like
when you decide

19:51.842 --> 19:54.758
to be Internet famous in online
conspiracy theory forums,

19:54.802 --> 19:57.065
you're kind of setting
yourself up for that joke.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.807
Just level with us...
Do you really think that

19:59.850 --> 20:02.940
some kind of mischief
went on, on Flight 912?

20:02.984 --> 20:05.204
Or did you just get
so bored and rich

20:05.247 --> 20:06.833
after you sold your
cyber security company

20:06.857 --> 20:08.816
that you ran out of
stuff to spend money on?

20:08.859 --> 20:10.992
How much did it cost to bankroll

20:11.035 --> 20:13.124
five failed attempts
to uncover the wreckage?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.170
In terms of your
self-respect, I mean.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.563
Okay,

20:16.606 --> 20:18.434
I'm guilty.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.262
Of being a rich guy,
a free thinker,

20:20.306 --> 20:22.786
and having an interest
in finding a plane wreck

20:22.830 --> 20:24.179
that I couldn't.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.790
Last I checked, there was
no mandatory minimum

20:26.834 --> 20:28.270
for any of that.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.447
This...

20:31.491 --> 20:34.015
being stuck in a windowless cell
without being Mirandized

20:34.058 --> 20:36.278
or told what I'm
being charged with,

20:36.322 --> 20:37.603
that just sounds like
more evidence

20:37.627 --> 20:39.890
of deep state, if you ask me.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.457
Is that right?

20:41.501 --> 20:44.852
Well, we got evidence, too.
Show him the thing.

20:46.984 --> 20:50.553
They can deny it all day,
but, friends, I have sources

20:50.597 --> 20:52.599
who know for a fact
that the military

20:52.642 --> 20:55.819
is still actively searching
for Flight 912.

20:55.863 --> 20:59.170
And we better find it
before they do.

20:59.214 --> 21:03.131
Because if they get to it first,
you can guarantee

21:03.174 --> 21:07.178
that we will never learn
why that plane crashed.

21:07.222 --> 21:10.834
You didn't just have
an interest in 912.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.967
You believed that the military
was behind it

21:13.010 --> 21:15.317
and that they were gonna
step in and destroy

21:15.361 --> 21:17.624
any incriminating evidence
once the plane

21:17.667 --> 21:19.365
was dredged up.
So, what do you do?

21:19.408 --> 21:20.888
You hire a local diver

21:20.931 --> 21:23.325
to go down and get
the black box from the plane,

21:23.369 --> 21:25.240
while it's still at
the bottom of the ocean.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.157
Problem is, your diver
never came back up.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.899
Because the welder he hired
to go with him decided to put

21:31.942 --> 21:33.509
a bullet in the
back of his head,

21:33.553 --> 21:36.947
courtesy of some kind of
shark gun or some such thing.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.776
And then just left him to rot
at the bottom of the ocean.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.737
All right. Gonna guess
by your creepy blank expression

21:43.780 --> 21:45.391
that none of this
is news to you.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.784
Maybe you already have
the black box from the killer.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.177
Who knows?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.570
But accessory to commit murder?

21:50.613 --> 21:52.963
That definitely has
a mandatory minimum.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.878
You want some help with that?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.445
Give us a name.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.449
Wow.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.409
And I've been told I have
an active imagination.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.628
I'll admit that I chartered
a plane to Oahu

22:05.672 --> 22:07.935
the minute I heard
that that wreck had been found.

22:07.978 --> 22:11.025
I didn't have
anything to do with

22:11.068 --> 22:14.768
killing any diver
or stealing any black box.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.640
I'm not surprised by any of it.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.382
The truth is, there are
way bigger wackos out there

22:20.426 --> 22:21.949
when it comes to this stuff.

22:21.992 --> 22:25.300
Okay. So, to be clear,
you're not...

22:25.344 --> 22:26.867
you're not disputing
that you're crazy.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.190
You're telling us that there are

22:28.216 --> 22:29.783
much crazier people out there

22:29.826 --> 22:32.307
that we should be pursuing
rather than you.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.222
Yes.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.615
Well, anybody come to mind?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.182
Delphi Son.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.403
That ain't a name.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.449
I don't know his real name,
but this guy

22:43.492 --> 22:45.320
is basically the godfather

22:45.364 --> 22:48.062
of Flight 912
conspiracy theories.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.934
He posts under dozens
of different usernames

22:50.978 --> 22:53.372
across all the sites, promoting

22:53.415 --> 22:55.939
often contradictory
conspiracy theories.

22:55.983 --> 22:59.029
This guy is
even more responsible

22:59.073 --> 23:01.989
for 912 hype than I am.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.080
Okay.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.344
Hey.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.607
What are you gonna do?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.696
Deep-state stuff, man.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.744
Just sit tight.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.986
Check for any communication
he may have had with Kahale.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.143
And while you're at it,
check into this Delphi Son,

23:26.187 --> 23:28.798
whoever that is. Copy that.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.899
Come on.

23:55.172 --> 23:58.001
Maybe they're digging
your grave in advance.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.047
That'd be considerate of them.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.617
No, my guess is
they're moving something.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.140
Probably a body.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.505
That is a lot of money.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.246
That's the kind of money

24:25.289 --> 24:26.615
Cullen isn't gonna be
leaving behind

24:26.639 --> 24:28.249
if he's thinking
about disappearing.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.689
They're on the move.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.387
Hey, what's the
good word, kiddo?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.085
Well, you know Kahale's
burned-out boat?

24:38.128 --> 24:40.870
CSU found a few pieces of gear
that survived the blaze.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.065
Specifically,
some fire-retardant gloves

24:42.089 --> 24:43.177
and a Kevlar apron.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.546
Oh, that has to
belong to a welder.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.528
Yeah. Lab are running
DNAs tests as we speak,

24:46.572 --> 24:47.766
so hopefully we can get a hit.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.662
All right, how about you?

24:49.705 --> 24:52.839
You find anything to link
that kook Pollock to our vic?

24:52.882 --> 24:54.275
Unfortunately, no.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.712
I dumped his phone
and his laptop,

24:56.756 --> 24:59.149
and there's really nothing here
that would indicate

24:59.193 --> 25:00.977
that he and Kahale
were in communication.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.806
So he was telling
the truth? Yeah, it looks like it.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.243
But he was right about
that Delphi Son person.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.549
Whoever they are,

25:07.593 --> 25:09.812
they generate about 80%
of the posts

25:09.856 --> 25:13.076
on these conspiracy forums
about Flight 912.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.817
So, who stands
to benefit from him

25:14.861 --> 25:17.603
keeping that plane crash
on people's minds? TANI: I don't know.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.169
But I think we might be
getting an I.D.

25:19.213 --> 25:22.346
HPD's Cyber unit
is tracking the IP address

25:22.390 --> 25:23.783
that Delphi Son was using.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.176
With a VPN, it makes the user
hard to find,

25:26.220 --> 25:27.961
but it's not impossible.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.006
I think a guy walking that fast

25:30.050 --> 25:31.530
must have something
important to say.

25:31.573 --> 25:32.748
Actually, yeah.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.117
The plane wreckage
was finally recovered

25:34.141 --> 25:35.969
a few hours ago, and get this:

25:36.012 --> 25:38.188
turns out the black box
was still on board.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.189
Get out.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.582
Are you sure?

25:40.626 --> 25:42.671
NTSB just received it
from the salvage company.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.238
They're analyzing it
as we speak.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.805
If our vic was not going

25:45.848 --> 25:47.347
down there to get
the black box, then...

25:47.371 --> 25:48.808
Then what was he doing
down there?

25:48.851 --> 25:51.462
I don't know, but they started
processing the wreck,

25:51.506 --> 25:55.336
and it appears a welding gun
was used to remove several seats

25:55.379 --> 25:56.816
from the first-class cabin.

25:56.859 --> 25:57.904
Well, that's it.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.124
One of the first-class
passengers must have

26:01.168 --> 26:02.822
hidden something
beneath their seat.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.955
Yeah. Something worth
killing for.

26:35.376 --> 26:36.725
That's not good.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.206
Bishop must have
made us back there.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.165
Yeah, and made sure
we couldn't follow him

26:42.209 --> 26:44.211
to wherever
he's taking the cash.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.963
So, there were 24 passengers
seated in the first-class cabin.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.655
One of them was carrying
the item or items

26:53.699 --> 26:55.459
Kahale was hired to retrieve. GROVER: All
right, folks,

26:55.483 --> 26:58.181
these people died
over 30 years ago.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.357
We've got names,
we've got old addresses,

27:00.401 --> 27:02.664
employee records
and not much else.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.927
Gonna have to dig deep. TANI: Deep like...

27:04.971 --> 27:07.974
oh, I don't know,
bottom of the ocean?

27:08.017 --> 27:09.628
See what I did there?

27:10.716 --> 27:11.978
Nailed it.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.676
Okay, great.
Thank you very much.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.808
Thank you.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.374
Tow truck's on the way.

27:17.418 --> 27:20.508
You sure you don't want to
just drive back on the rims?

27:20.551 --> 27:21.901
My blood sugar's low.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.705
Oh, I got some beef jerky
in the truck. You want it?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.513
I'd rather eat my own fingers.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.081
What do you got
against beef jerky?

27:28.124 --> 27:30.649
Nothing. Except
that it's meat

27:30.692 --> 27:32.259
trying to do a
plywood impression.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.871
Oh, good news.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.743
HPD still has eyes on Cullen,

27:37.786 --> 27:39.919
but Bishop has not shown up
with the money yet.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.443
Any chance these guys are gonna
double-cross their boss?

27:42.486 --> 27:45.664
I don't know.
I mean, it's possible.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.970
Good news is, at some point,
that money and Cullen

27:48.014 --> 27:50.930
are gonna be in the same place,
and we're gonna be right there.

27:55.108 --> 27:59.721
So... any ideas on how
we can kill some time

27:59.765 --> 28:01.245
while we're waiting
for the tow truck?

28:03.029 --> 28:06.597
Wow. That sounded so
different in my head.

28:06.641 --> 28:07.686
It did?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.731
Yeah. What was in your head?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.341
Play tic-tac-toe.Tic-tac...

28:11.385 --> 28:12.754
Yeah. You're thinking about
playing tic-tac-toe?

28:12.778 --> 28:14.693
I was. Yeah. I don't want to play
tic-tac-toe.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.608
Okay. Well, uh...
20 questions?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.436
Sure. You go first.Okay. Oh, yeah.

28:20.481 --> 28:21.874
I'm thinking about a thing.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.703
A croissant. Oh, damn you,
Commander.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.444
So I dug through all my
passengers, and I got nothing.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.273
Yeah, me, too.
I thought I had a guy, 3C,

28:30.317 --> 28:33.363
but turns out he just shared
a name with a murder suspect

28:33.407 --> 28:35.714
from a homicide in
Boston back in '81.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.889
Guys, we struck out.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.325
Please tell us
you got something.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.022
So, I heard back from HPD Cyber.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.068
Our conspiracy peddler,

28:42.111 --> 28:43.722
Delphi Son... GROVER: Yeah?

28:43.765 --> 28:45.854
It's none other than Joe Ennis.

28:45.898 --> 28:46.986
- Our Joe?
- Mm-hmm.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.117
The very same.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.466
Yeah, he's been hyping up

28:49.510 --> 28:51.270
these conspiracies,
and we think we know why.

28:51.294 --> 28:55.298
Turns out the passenger in 4C
was Joe's brother, Ron Ennis.

28:55.342 --> 28:58.780
Was it odd that he was sitting
in first class?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.608
No, but what was odd

29:00.651 --> 29:02.001
was his travel itinerary.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.916
According to flight records,

29:03.959 --> 29:07.136
Ron Ennis was in New York
for less than 24 hours.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.140
Barely enough time for dinner
and a Broadway show.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.185
But it was enough time for him
to pull off this.

29:12.228 --> 29:15.014
"Dizzy New Heist: Socialite
Murdered in Jewel Robbery

29:15.057 --> 29:16.406
on 49th Floor."

29:16.450 --> 29:18.147
The victim was Hannah Carlisle,

29:18.191 --> 29:19.932
heir to a cosmetics fortune.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.629
She was killed
when she came home

29:21.672 --> 29:23.674
to find the robber
breaking into her safe.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.502
Thief took her life
and $4.1 million

29:25.546 --> 29:27.069
in jewelry.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.481
And by the NYPD
starts investigating,

29:28.505 --> 29:31.944
Ron Ennis is already on a
flight back to Honolulu.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.336
Right, but here's
the real kicker.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.948
The big international
insurance company that held

29:35.991 --> 29:37.601
Hannah Carlisle's policy...

29:37.645 --> 29:40.648
Joe Ennis worked
in their Honolulu office.

29:40.691 --> 29:41.997
Mmm. JUNIOR: Well,
there you go.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.670
See, with that kind
of inside information,

29:43.694 --> 29:45.827
of course he would know
what was inside that safe.

29:45.871 --> 29:49.048
$4.1 million in jewelry.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.267
Back in the '80s? That's got
to be $10 million now.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.834
Mm-hmm. No wonder the guy
never stopped

29:52.878 --> 29:54.270
looking for that damn plane.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.533
Yeah, so when the plane
turns up, Joe wastes no time.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.014
He sends a couple divers
down there for 30 grand a pop

29:59.058 --> 30:00.450
to bring up
his brother's suitcase.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.061
Except one of them
kills the other

30:02.104 --> 30:03.540
and is now shaking down Joe.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.257
Well, it seems like now
everything this guy touches

30:05.281 --> 30:06.239
turns to crap.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.849
And the bodies keep piling up.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.461
We got to find Joe.

30:11.505 --> 30:14.247
Tac One,
you are cleared to breach.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.817
Go!

30:21.254 --> 30:23.473
Clear! Clear!

30:23.517 --> 30:24.953
Clear!

30:26.302 --> 30:29.088
All clear.
No sign of the suspect.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.925
If you're looking
for a 20 on Joe Ennis,

30:39.968 --> 30:42.014
I got some bad news for you.
He ain't here.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.624
When Tani and Junior
went by his office,

30:43.667 --> 30:45.452
he wasn't there, either,
but check this out.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.497
Over the last two days,
Joe wired money

30:47.541 --> 30:48.803
into his checking account

30:48.847 --> 30:50.239
from a bunch
of different sources.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.372
Half a million dollars total.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.635
Oh. Well, that sounds like
a nice round figure

30:54.678 --> 30:56.550
to pay off an underwater bandit.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.073
Exactly.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.684
And he just withdrew it all
in cash.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.078
Well, that must mean
that Joe's already on his way

31:03.122 --> 31:06.038
to meet with the killer, and we
have have no idea where that is.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.697
APB went out wide...
Still no Joe.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.414
All right, we need to seal up
the ports and the airports.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.112
I'm sure that Joe's gonna
try to leave town

31:17.136 --> 31:18.833
the minute he gets
his hands on that money.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.140
I got news. DNA results are
back on the glove found

31:21.183 --> 31:23.055
on our vic's boat. TANI: Any hits?

31:23.098 --> 31:26.058
No, but they were able to
determine that it's female DNA.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.451
Underwater welding
is already so niche,

31:28.495 --> 31:30.671
I feel like the number
of women in that field

31:30.714 --> 31:32.064
is a niche within a niche.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.587
You're right.
I already checked.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.068
There are four female underwater
welders on all of Oahu,

31:36.111 --> 31:39.593
and only one of them has worked
with our victim before.Mm-hmm.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.551
Okay.
Name's Sara Brown.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.423
Works underwater demo for

31:43.466 --> 31:45.686
a local outfit
near Honolulu Harbor.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.906
Well, given their history,
I'm sure Kahale reached out

31:47.949 --> 31:49.864
to Ms. Brown to partner with him
on this gig.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.388
Well, that was a mistake.
Hey, guys, I just got off

31:52.432 --> 31:54.105
with Sara Brown's supervisor.
She took off with one

31:54.129 --> 31:56.151
of their work boats today,
told him it was for a job.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.612
Well, they'll certainly be
disappointed to find out

31:58.655 --> 32:00.266
she's been using
company resources

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
for her little murderous
side hustle.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.140
Good news for us is those
boats have GPS trackers,

32:05.184 --> 32:07.621
so right now we have Brown's
current location.

No!

33:11.902 --> 33:14.166
Clear. I'll check
the perimeter.

This is Officer Lou Grover

33:15.471 --> 33:16.535
requesting immediate assistance.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.953
We're at Pier 14,
right off Nimitz.

Joe, which way did she go?

Hey!

Hey! Five-O! Stop!

Stop!

Breathing's shallow.

36:02.899 --> 36:06.164
You are very much under arrest.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.825
I didn't know they taught

36:15.869 --> 36:17.914
underwater fighting
in mermaid school.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.526
You should see what I can do
when I have my tail.
Mm?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.659
Well, I just got off
the phone from the hospital.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.140
Our pal Joe is headed
into surgery

36:26.184 --> 36:28.490
and looks like he's gonna
survive that gut shot.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.755
Hey, just got a call
from the NTSB.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.454
They finished their analysis of
the black box from Flight 912.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.107
All right, here we go.
Let's have it.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.458
Was it a bird strike?

36:39.501 --> 36:40.850
Pilot error? What?

36:40.894 --> 36:43.723
That's the thing.
According to the NTSB tech,

36:43.766 --> 36:45.855
there's no data
in the black box.

36:45.899 --> 36:49.119
You mean it's damaged from
being underwater for so long?

36:49.163 --> 36:50.469
No.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.211
I mean, someone wiped it.

37:10.140 --> 37:13.492
What's up?

37:13.535 --> 37:17.713
That call you got earlier,
it was from a woman in Iraq.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.498
Her husband was a police officer

37:19.541 --> 37:21.891
who was killed in
Mosul last year.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.806
You traced my phone call?

37:23.850 --> 37:26.287
Which is interesting to me
because I know for a fact

37:26.331 --> 37:27.767
you were stationed
there for a time,

37:27.810 --> 37:29.899
training local police forces.
You know, if you're

37:29.943 --> 37:31.945
really that interested,
you could've just asked.

37:31.988 --> 37:35.253
I am asking. This is me asking.
What happened?

37:38.734 --> 37:41.563
Two weeks after we
finished training him,

37:41.607 --> 37:44.305
he was gunned down
by some local insurgents.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.438
We spent months training them,

37:46.481 --> 37:49.136
teaching them everything
that we could.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.400
Okay.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.446
I mean, we are talking about

37:54.489 --> 37:56.709
one of the most dangerous parts
of the planet right now.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.469
I-I get the feeling that
no amount of training

37:58.493 --> 38:01.888
would've saved that guy's
life, I'm sorry to say.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.499
I keep in touch with his widow.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.589
It's nearly impossible for her
to make a living over there,

38:07.633 --> 38:08.982
let alone support two kids.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.507
I help out when I can.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.816
So, is it just me,

38:16.859 --> 38:19.035
or are you always this up
in everyone's business?

38:19.079 --> 38:20.689
No, it's just you.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.735
Look, if I'm gonna be
working with somebody,

38:22.778 --> 38:25.520
I like to know as much
as I can about them.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.355
When I first met you,
I had this feeling

38:34.399 --> 38:36.749
that you'd be a great
fit for the task force.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.098
You mean when we were

38:38.141 --> 38:40.579
pointing guns
in each other's faces? Mm, yes.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.451
I kind of have a gut
instinct on these things.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.541
And, I mean, of course,
you're gonna need

38:46.585 --> 38:48.282
an official discharge,
but I figured,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.502
given your recent
disciplinary actions,

38:50.545 --> 38:52.939
your C.O. wouldn't have
a problem with that.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.425
So, what do you say, Quinn?

39:18.660 --> 39:20.532
It would be an honor.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.535
Right answer.
Welcome aboard.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.066
Hands. Let me see
your hands right now.

39:33.109 --> 39:37.418
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh. Take it easy. Take it easy.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.917
I'm Commander Steve McGarrett
of the Five-O Task Force.

39:38.941 --> 39:39.899
What's going on?

39:39.942 --> 39:42.031
Sergeant Liu, under orders

39:42.075 --> 39:45.470
of the provost marshal general,
you are under arrest.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.646
Wait, what the hell? Wh-What is this?

39:47.689 --> 39:49.406
We have our orders, Commander.
Please, stand down.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.390
Stand down? Hey, Quinn, I got...
Get out of the way. Quinn.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.392
Just don't worry,
sit tight, okay?

39:54.435 --> 39:55.715
I'm gonna to the bottom of this.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.486
You better have
a damn good reason

40:01.529 --> 40:02.637
for doing what you just did.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.576
CID got an anonymous tip
a few hours ago.

40:04.619 --> 40:07.230
We searched Sergeant
Liu's apartment,

40:07.274 --> 40:09.034
found a substantial amount
of currency associated

40:09.058 --> 40:10.712
with a money laundering
operation.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.344
Hey! Let me ask
you a question.

40:34.388 --> 40:35.998
You thought that stunt
was gonna work?

40:36.042 --> 40:38.784
Huh? I made one phone call,
one phone call to the governor.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.109
Quinn's being processed
out as we speak.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.632
Let me get something
clear with you right now.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.807
So, listen, you want
to do this with me?

40:42.831 --> 40:44.050
You want to dance with me?

40:44.093 --> 40:45.419
I'll do this
every single day of your life.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.270
I'll make your
life so miserable,

40:47.314 --> 40:49.142
you'll wish
for an eight-by-ten cell

40:49.185 --> 40:51.187
just to get some peace.
All right?

40:51.231 --> 40:53.059
You know, Commander,

40:53.102 --> 40:55.670
you think you got
the whole picture.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.631
You have no idea
what's going on here.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.023
Is that right?

41:01.067 --> 41:02.653
But you're smart.
I'm sure, at some point,

41:02.677 --> 41:03.983
you'll figure it out.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.680
Yeah, I'm sure I will.
