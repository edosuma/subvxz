Damn.

00:28.868 --> 00:31.801
Radio: and severe thunderstorms
And localized downpours

00:31.868 --> 00:34.334
Will rumble over areas
Of northern california

00:34.400 --> 00:36.434
And central nevada
Tonight and tomorrow.

00:36.501 --> 00:39.501
Flood warnings for storey,
Lyon, and carson counties

00:39.567 --> 00:41.467
That's great.
Are in effect until 8 a.m.

00:41.534 --> 00:42.467

01:16.501 --> 01:19.367
Off the big road,
South of sin city.

01:19.434 --> 01:22.601
 Got a four-wheeler,
Sitting duck.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.634
Hey, if you guys
Are hungry,

01:42.701 --> 01:45.300
I know a pretty
Good indian restaurant
That's open all night.

01:45.367 --> 01:46.300
Oh, I can't.
I have a date.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.033
You got a date?
With who?

01:49.100 --> 01:50.400
My hot tub.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.200
Now, that sounds
Like a party.

01:52.267 --> 01:53.868
You're so not invited.

01:53.934 --> 01:55.067
Hold up, guys.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.467
Change of plans.

01:58.534 --> 01:59.701
I'm glad I caught you.
Is everything ok?

01:59.767 --> 02:02.100
I've been on the phone
With a sheriff in nevada.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.634
There's been a series
Of suspicious accidents

02:03.701 --> 02:05.434
In the reno area
That may be connected.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.334
Jj, this can't wait
Till morning?

02:07.400 --> 02:09.868
I don't think so.
If I'm right about this,

02:09.934 --> 02:12.767
I think we'll be leaving
First thing tomorrow. Sorry.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.734
3 nights ago,
Outside of reno,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.100
This car was hit
By a tractor trailer.

02:17.167 --> 02:18.767
Any survivors?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.267
The truck driver
Walked away unharmed.

02:20.334 --> 02:21.601
Jonathan and rebecca gallen,

02:21.667 --> 02:23.834
The passengers
In the car, were doa.

02:23.901 --> 02:25.634
When the local sheriff
Arrived on the scene,

02:25.701 --> 02:29.033
He noticed several things--
No blood spatter
Inside the car,

02:29.100 --> 02:30.767
No seat belt burns.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.801
No lacerations
From the air bags.

02:32.868 --> 02:34.968
They were dead
Before the accident.

02:35.033 --> 02:37.801
The autopsy confirmed that
And the cause of death.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.133
Blunt force head trauma

02:39.200 --> 02:42.701
And evidence of rape
And torture to the woman.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.467
The unsub wasn't
Very successful
At hiding the fact

02:44.534 --> 02:45.801
That he murdered
Two people.

02:45.868 --> 02:46.968
Well, there's a chance

02:47.033 --> 02:48.601
That he has gotten away
With it before.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.534
After I spoke to the sheriff,
I had garcia

02:50.601 --> 02:52.534
Look into any similar accidents

02:52.601 --> 02:54.801
Near the
California-nevada border.

02:54.868 --> 02:58.534
She found two
With a similar m.o.
In the past couple of weeks.

02:58.601 --> 03:01.567
Both were couples, in a car,
Hit by a tractor trailer.

03:01.634 --> 03:02.701
It's always
A man and a woman

03:02.767 --> 03:04.267
Stopped right in
The middle of the road.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.300
It's always at night
On a remote highway.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.634
It can't be a coincidence
The victim type

03:08.701 --> 03:10.334
And this very specific m.o.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.167
Are the same in all 3 cases.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.334
Was garcia able to find any
Connection between them?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.634
One thing they have in common
Is that they all disappeared

03:16.701 --> 03:18.434
For 48 hours
Prior to the accidents.

03:18.501 --> 03:21.601
We know what
He does to his victims
During that time.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.100
We just need to figure out
Where he finds them.

03:27.534 --> 03:30.767
Wow. I can barely
Keep my eyes open.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.200
You've been asleep
Since we left reno.

03:33.267 --> 03:36.000
Really?

03:36.067 --> 03:37.167
Oops.

03:42.234 --> 03:43.167
[horn blasting]

03:43.234 --> 03:45.067
Aah! Ian, look out!

03:45.133 --> 03:46.901
Aah!
Oh!

03:46.968 --> 03:48.033
 Aah!

03:49.501 --> 03:51.033
[breathing hard] ian...

03:53.567 --> 03:55.133
Are you ok?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.634
Yeah.

03:57.701 --> 03:58.968
That was close.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.601
Yeah.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.033
Maybe we both
Need some rest.

04:04.601 --> 04:05.734
Yeah.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.100
You coming in?

04:18.166 --> 04:21.267
No. I'm gonna call your mom
And check in with the kids.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.100
You better
Lock the doors.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.100
I'm not afraid of the dark.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.767
Sure, you're not.

05:09.801 --> 05:10.734

05:10.801 --> 05:12.901
Ha ha!
Damn it, ian.

05:12.968 --> 05:14.400
You scared me.

05:14.467 --> 05:16.367
Time to get
Your second wind.

05:16.434 --> 05:17.901
Oh, god.

05:17.968 --> 05:19.767
We've got
This little paradise
All to ourselves.

05:19.834 --> 05:20.934
What do you mean?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.100
Look around. We're
The only ones here.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.501
Oh, it's such
A beautiful night.

05:26.567 --> 05:27.767
Yeah.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.267
Ohh. Let's
Get to the cabin.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.434
I'm so glad
We took this trip.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.601
Me, too.

06:18.634 --> 06:22.367

06:24.534 --> 06:25.601
Jj.

06:25.667 --> 06:26.968
It's so
The baby can't hear.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.834
What's he
Listening to?

06:28.901 --> 06:29.868
Beethoven.

06:29.934 --> 06:32.033
I personally preferred
Mozart, myself.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.567
But be careful
To limit his exposure
To one hour a day.

06:34.634 --> 06:37.734
Amniotic fluids
Have a tendency
To amplify sound.

06:37.801 --> 06:40.133
Thanks for the reminder, doc.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.033
Ok, so, all 3 crashes
Were on highways

06:44.100 --> 06:46.133
Outside of carson city,
Lake tahoe, and reno.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.434
All cities with
A large and diverse
Transient population.

06:49.501 --> 06:51.133
Not to mention
The thousands

06:51.200 --> 06:52.801
Of locals mixing
With seasonal workers.

06:52.868 --> 06:54.767
An endless pool
Of victims to chose from.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.934
Rebecca gallen
Was beaten badly.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.133
Ribs broken antemortem.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
He'd need time
And privacy to do this.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.901
That would suggest
The killer either lives

07:01.968 --> 07:03.267
Or works in the area.

07:03.334 --> 07:05.033
He's going to such extremes
To try and hide the murders.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.400
Maybe he has a connection
To the victims.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.467
What does the press know?

07:07.534 --> 07:09.334
All media outlets
Are reporting an accident.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.267
One thing going for us--the
Killer has no idea we know.

07:12.334 --> 07:13.400
That helps us.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.667
Jj, when we land,
Will you explain

07:14.734 --> 07:16.400
To sheriff bruner
And his deputies

07:16.467 --> 07:18.434
How important it is
To keep this quiet.

07:18.501 --> 07:20.400
Got it.
If the unsub
Finds out we're here,

07:20.467 --> 07:21.734
All bets are off.

07:21.801 --> 07:23.234
He could change his m.o.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.567
Or just pick up and find
His victims somewhere else.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.734
[moaning]

07:47.834 --> 07:49.434
Am I dreaming?

07:49.501 --> 07:51.100
Mmm...

07:51.167 --> 07:52.567
Time to get up.

07:52.634 --> 07:54.767
No, it's a nightmare.

07:54.834 --> 07:59.033
I want banana pancakes.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.234
[groans]

08:01.300 --> 08:02.534
Please?

08:02.601 --> 08:05.267
Abby corbin,
We don't have any kids,

08:05.334 --> 08:08.601
Dogs, or parents to deal with
For 8 more hours.

08:08.667 --> 08:09.934
Please let me sleep.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.400
Oh, come on.

08:11.467 --> 08:17.234
Doesn't melted butter and
Maple syrup sound so good?

08:17.300 --> 08:19.901
I'll tell you what sounds
Really good right now.

08:19.968 --> 08:21.901
What?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.901
Peace and quiet.

08:23.968 --> 08:27.734
You're so not
A morning person.

08:27.801 --> 08:30.400
You knew that
Before we got married.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.234
From this point on,
The company line is simple.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.400
The fbi's here investigating
A missing persons.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.701
You may be thinking if
The public knew the truth,

08:39.767 --> 08:41.200
They might be
Able to help us.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.534
But we can't risk
This getting out

08:43.601 --> 08:44.968
Because this killer
Needs to believe

08:45.033 --> 08:46.267
He's getting away
With murder.

08:46.334 --> 08:48.234
Any future calls related
To this investigation

08:48.300 --> 08:50.334
Will be directed to me
Or agent jareau.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.434
Remember, if we can just
Keep a lid on this now,

08:52.501 --> 08:55.968
It'll only
Help us later. Thanks.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.067
Thank you, agent jareau.
Yeah. Just doing my job.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.667
Ah. It's not much,

09:00.734 --> 09:02.667
But it's a place
To hang your hats.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.234
All we need is a table
And an evidence board.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.200
Sheriff, if you don't mind,
Some of us would like to go

09:06.267 --> 09:07.434
To the site of the accident.

09:07.501 --> 09:10.334
I'll have a deputy take you.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.234
Rebecca gallen's father is
Coming in to claim the bodies.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.767
Why don't you let us
Take care of that?

09:14.834 --> 09:15.901
I appreciate it.

09:15.968 --> 09:17.400
I'll drive you myself.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.634
Do you have any aerial
Photos of the crash sites?

09:19.701 --> 09:21.400
We didn't think to get any.

09:21.467 --> 09:22.400
Not a problem.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.400
I'll have our
Technical analyst

09:23.467 --> 09:25.067
Get some from the nsa.

09:25.133 --> 09:27.801
I'd like to see what
The areas surrounding
The highways are like.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.167
First victims,
Fritz and johanna dietrich,

09:35.234 --> 09:37.667
Were found 10 days ago,
Visiting from germany.

09:37.734 --> 09:41.234
Their accident site
Was on highway 50
Just south of tahoe.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.901
Second couple,
Melissa and tom taylor,
Were from oregon.

09:43.968 --> 09:46.701
They were found on the
267, northeast of tahoe,

09:46.767 --> 09:48.067
Not far from
The interstate.

09:48.133 --> 09:49.267
It's right here.

09:49.334 --> 09:50.934
And the latest victims,
Jonathan and rebecca gallen,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.934
Were from arizona.
Their accident occurred

09:53.000 --> 09:55.667
Between reno and carson
City on highway 395.

09:55.734 --> 09:57.267
Right here.

09:57.334 --> 09:59.868
All 3 couples
Were staying in the area
Without reservations.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.868
And the only
Transactions
On their credit cards

10:01.934 --> 10:04.167
Were from gas stations
Hundred of miles away.

10:04.234 --> 10:06.133
The common theme here
Is no paper trail.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.100
If no one can contact
Them or trace them,

10:08.167 --> 10:09.334
They become
The perfect victims.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.601
Rebecca gallen's father
Is going to be here soon.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.667
I'll talk to him. Maybe
He can help us fill in
Some of the blanks.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.634
[horn blasting]

10:23.467 --> 10:25.133
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home now

10:25.200 --> 10:27.667
And tell my wife that
I didn't kill that couple.

10:27.734 --> 10:28.667
Sir, we're gonna have
To ask you not to do that.

10:28.734 --> 10:30.934
But everyone
Believes I killed them.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.634
You don't know
What that feels like.

10:32.701 --> 10:34.100
We understand what
We're asking of you,

10:34.167 --> 10:36.367
But this is an
Extremely important part
Of our investigation.

10:36.434 --> 10:39.467
We need the public
To continue to believe
This was an accident.

10:39.534 --> 10:42.000
Mr. Jones,
We will catch this guy.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.501
And when we do,
Your good name
Will be vindicated.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.100
I promise you that.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.100
[police radio]

10:48.167 --> 10:49.434
Well, ok.

10:49.501 --> 10:51.567
If I can think
Of anything that would be

10:51.634 --> 10:53.467
Of use to you,
I'll let you know.

10:53.534 --> 10:54.734
Thank you for
Your time, sir.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.467
This guy could've left
The bodies anywhere.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.901
On the side of the road,
Buried in the ground.

11:01.968 --> 11:04.567
But he didn't.
And there's a reason for that.

11:04.634 --> 11:05.567
Yeah.
He's taunting us.

11:05.634 --> 11:07.234
No, he's not.
This behavior tells us

11:07.300 --> 11:08.400
The risk of leaving
The bodies

11:08.467 --> 11:10.100
Where he killed them
Is greater than the risk

11:10.167 --> 11:11.400
He takes staging
These accidents.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.934
Thank you.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.234
Satellite photos.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.200
Look at that.
All 3 accident sites
Have similar blind curves.

11:21.267 --> 11:24.334
The grade of the hill
About the same,
Every location.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.133
Now, what are these areas
Just off the highway?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.267
Some are fire roads,
Some are trails for
Off-road vehicles,

11:29.334 --> 11:30.334
Atvs, such.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.167
We know
This guy's organized.

11:32.234 --> 11:36.601
Looks like he plans
His escapes in advance.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.133
Mr. Sanders,
I'm very sorry

11:48.200 --> 11:50.767
That you have
To be here under
These circumstances.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.834
No father should have to claim
His daughter's dead body.

11:53.901 --> 11:56.968
You're also here for your
Son-in-law jon, correct?

11:57.033 --> 12:00.868
Uh, I'm gonna
I need a full copy
Of that accident report.

12:00.934 --> 12:03.767
We're suing that truck driver
And his employer.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.467
Mr. Sanders,

12:06.534 --> 12:08.634
Your daughter
And son-in-law were hit

12:08.701 --> 12:12.200
By the tractor trailer,
But that's not
How they died.

12:12.267 --> 12:14.834
What are you talking about?

12:14.901 --> 12:17.434
They were dead hours
Before the collision.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.801
No. The police told us
They died in the accident.

12:19.868 --> 12:20.901
Yes, sir.
I understand that.

12:20.968 --> 12:22.767
We had to wait
For the autopsy results.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.300
And they confirmed that
They had been murdered.

12:34.033 --> 12:36.367
Sir, I do understand
How hard this is.

12:36.434 --> 12:39.133
We believe that rebecca
And jon are the third couple

12:39.200 --> 12:40.634
To die in these
Circumstances.

12:40.701 --> 12:44.467
Who would want
To kill my baby?

12:44.534 --> 12:48.000
I have a couple
Of questions.

12:48.067 --> 12:51.100
We found camping equipment
In the back of jon's car.

12:51.167 --> 12:55.267
Yeah, yeah. He was real
Big on the outdoors.

12:55.334 --> 12:57.701
This time he had to
Drag her along with him.

12:57.767 --> 12:58.801
Do you know where
He liked to camp?

12:58.868 --> 13:00.868
No.
Where he liked to hike?

13:00.934 --> 13:02.400
I don't know.

13:02.467 --> 13:05.767
Did he ever bring
Rebecca souvenirs?

13:05.834 --> 13:07.067
T-shirts
From anywhere?

13:07.133 --> 13:09.734
I don't know.

13:11.133 --> 13:14.267
How about restaurants?
Places he liked to eat.

13:14.334 --> 13:18.367
Um...my baby has a...

13:18.434 --> 13:21.467
Had a sweet tooth,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.400
And, uh...

13:23.467 --> 13:26.400
Jon would always bring
Her back these doughnuts.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.734
We found a matchbook
From a diner...flo's?

13:31.801 --> 13:32.901
Does that ring a bell?

13:32.968 --> 13:35.200
Maybe. I can't be sure.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.400
It was a real popular place.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.601
But...

13:39.667 --> 13:45.767
He always brought
Some back for her, and...

13:45.834 --> 13:47.734
And...

13:48.834 --> 13:51.133
Thank you.

13:57.901 --> 13:59.200
Be right with you.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.234
It's not even
Lunchtime yet.

14:02.300 --> 14:07.100
The sign said people
Travel for miles
For flo's doughnuts.

14:07.167 --> 14:11.133
Sorry to keep you
Waiting. Would you like
A dozen to share?

14:11.200 --> 14:12.934
Ooh. Fbi.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.434
Ma'am, we're trying to trace
The steps of a couple

14:14.501 --> 14:16.100
That may have been
Here a few days ago.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.901
Darlin', I've waited
On 87 folks since
We opened this morning.

14:19.968 --> 14:21.400
Somebody would have to
Come through here doing

14:21.467 --> 14:23.767
Cartwheels on fire
For me to remember.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.267
Would you take
A look anyway, please?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.067
Huh. Well, I'll be.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.267
I do remember them.

14:34.334 --> 14:35.968
Were they doing cartwheels?

14:36.033 --> 14:37.267
No, but I was.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.200
The lady left me a $10
Tip for breakfast,

14:39.267 --> 14:40.601
2 days in a row.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.334
Nice couple.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.000
They in some kind
Of trouble?

14:46.968 --> 14:48.434
[yawning]

14:51.334 --> 14:54.300
There's no cell service
Up here.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.567
And that's a bad thing why?

14:56.634 --> 14:59.367
Well, I do want to
Check in on the kids.

14:59.434 --> 15:00.801
We'll be home by dinner.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.868
Hey, I can't
Find my underwear.

15:07.934 --> 15:09.467
Have you seen them?
You kind of caught me.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.367
[laughs] I'm serious.

15:11.434 --> 15:12.634
I don't know.

15:12.701 --> 15:14.734
I threw them in that
Vicinity over there.

15:14.801 --> 15:17.200
You know what?
They didn't just
Get up and walk away.

15:17.267 --> 15:18.367
Where...

15:18.434 --> 15:19.534
[knock on door]

15:28.467 --> 15:29.400
Hey.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.067
Here you go.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.567
All right. Thank you.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.734
Hey, it's breakfast.

15:39.868 --> 15:41.534
Oh.

15:41.601 --> 15:42.901
 Oh.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.400
Um...

15:46.467 --> 15:50.000
Ok. This chair is
Bolted to the floor.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.734
Someone really thinks
We'd want to steal this crap?

15:52.801 --> 15:54.267
One man's trash...

15:54.334 --> 15:56.767
Yeah, I know. I know.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.534
Did you find
Your underwear?

15:58.601 --> 16:01.267
No.

16:01.334 --> 16:02.534
It's not funny.

16:02.601 --> 16:03.734
I'm not laughing.

16:03.801 --> 16:05.400
But if I start looking
Around and find it...

16:05.467 --> 16:06.834
You owe me lunch.

16:06.901 --> 16:08.701
[sighs] I'll take that bet.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.868
Mm-hmm.

16:09.934 --> 16:14.033
Well, at least you finally
Got my breakfast.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.100
I didn't order this.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.701
Right.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.834
I didn't.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.868
Well, neither did i.

16:24.767 --> 16:28.734
Ok. So who knew
I wanted banana pancakes?

16:29.834 --> 16:31.300
It's time to go.

16:35.968 --> 16:39.567
We have a witness
Who can put the gallens

16:39.634 --> 16:41.367
At a diner in sherwood.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.033
So it's possible they
Were staying close by.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.100
[telephone rings]

16:44.167 --> 16:47.300
I thought you forgot
About me. It hurt.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.267
Garcia, what information do
You have on sherwood, nevada?

16:49.334 --> 16:51.434
Uhh...sherwood.

16:51.501 --> 16:54.267
A lovely town that
Is east of lake tahoe

16:54.334 --> 16:55.968
Near the state line.

16:56.033 --> 16:59.100
This area has close to 300
Hotels, motels, and resorts.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.133
Garcia, can you
Send us a list of--

17:00.200 --> 17:01.133
Addresses and phone numbers?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.567
On its way, kind sir.

17:02.634 --> 17:05.000
Anything else
I can do you for?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.367
Not for now.
Thank you, garcia.

17:06.434 --> 17:08.300
You, my fine furry
Friends, are welcome.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.032
Remind me to have
Her drug tested.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.233
So what's our plan?

17:12.300 --> 17:13.767
I'll start narrowing
Down the list.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.334
Then what?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.666
We knock on every door
And show pictures
Of the gallens.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.666
That could
Take days, weeks even.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.166
I know we don't
Have the manpower,

17:20.233 --> 17:22.267
But at this point,
What choice do we have?

17:24.834 --> 17:26.800
Abby, let's go.
Car's running.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.367
Ok, ok.

17:29.601 --> 17:30.601
Did you get everything?

17:30.667 --> 17:32.334
Yes, I got it.
You sure?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.868
Yes. Um...

17:35.133 --> 17:36.634
Ian, it's stuck.

17:36.701 --> 17:37.934
You gotta
Just jiggle the handle.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.734
I can't.
All right. Well...

17:45.334 --> 17:47.133
What the hell?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.834
Wait a minute. Ian,
There's someone outside.

17:49.901 --> 17:51.601
Hello!

17:51.667 --> 17:53.067
Hey!
Open it!

17:53.133 --> 17:55.000
Hey! Open the door!

17:57.167 --> 17:58.767
Hey!

18:04.267 --> 18:05.234
Ian?

18:18.767 --> 18:19.901
Morning, jj.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.267
Sorry for the wake-up call.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.801
Hotch: it's all right.
Wasn't sleeping.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.834
It looks like we have
A possible missing persons.

18:24.901 --> 18:27.033
Ian and abby corbin were
In reno for the weekend.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.534
They were supposed
To be home yesterday.

18:28.601 --> 18:31.000
Where is home?
San luis obispo.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.834
They could've driven
Right through sherwood.

18:32.901 --> 18:34.267
They've already been
Missing a night.

18:34.334 --> 18:36.133
His mom's looking after
Their two kids.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.367
Call me when
Everybody gets here.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.934
What is this?
Left-over kung pao chicken?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.501
That's disgusting.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.167
What?
[laughs]

18:46.234 --> 18:49.834
The smell of chinese
Food makes you sick,

18:49.901 --> 18:53.000
But you don't even flinch
When you look at those pictures.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.000
She's pretty tough.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.801
[grunting]

18:58.734 --> 19:00.300
How much longer
Are you going to do that?

19:00.367 --> 19:02.133
We can't just sit here
All night.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.334
Well, we haven't
Been sitting...ian.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.334
And it's morning.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.167
What?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.167
Yeah.

19:10.501 --> 19:12.100
Is that cement?

19:12.167 --> 19:13.701
Mmm!
Calm down.

19:13.767 --> 19:16.367
Damn it, abby, I'm trying
To get us out of here.

19:16.434 --> 19:17.367
[high-pitched alarm]

19:20.400 --> 19:21.534
What was that?

19:21.601 --> 19:22.534
[banging]

19:28.801 --> 19:33.067
[clanging]

19:34.501 --> 19:36.868
[noise stops]

19:36.934 --> 19:38.534
Where did he go?

19:46.634 --> 19:47.868
I don't see him.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.701
Aah! My eye!

19:52.767 --> 19:53.767
Let me see it, please.

19:53.834 --> 19:54.767
Let me see.

19:54.834 --> 19:55.767
[alarm]

19:55.834 --> 19:58.067
Ohh!

19:58.133 --> 20:00.200
Ian and abby corbin
Have already been missing

20:00.267 --> 20:02.400
For over 24 hours,
Which means we may only have

20:02.467 --> 20:03.868
Until tonight
To find them.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.934
According to their families,
They left reno yesterday

20:06.000 --> 20:08.067
And were planning on stopping
Somewhere for the night.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.467
Rossi: they didn't
Use a credit card.

20:09.534 --> 20:11.467
Unless they travel
With a lot of cash,

20:11.534 --> 20:13.801
The room wasn't
Too expensive.

20:13.868 --> 20:15.400
They were not traveling
On the interstate.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.334
That eliminates half
Of our previous search.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.534
Sounds like we're
Looking for somebody

20:19.601 --> 20:21.934
Who works
The night shift
At a back road motel.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.400
And we think he's
Most likely in his
Early- to mid-30s.

20:24.467 --> 20:25.667
Why is that?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.801
Abducting couples
Is an ambitious task,

20:27.868 --> 20:30.000
And this guy's had time
To perfect his skill.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.267
He could be older.

20:31.334 --> 20:32.734
Don't get hung up
On his age.

20:32.801 --> 20:34.133
It's the hardest thing
To predict.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.701
What we do know
Is females take extensive
Beatings from him.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.434
That, combined with
The sexual assault,

20:38.501 --> 20:41.267
Tells us that he's a violent
Anger excitation rapist.

20:41.334 --> 20:43.367
A sexual sadist
Like this can't get off

20:43.434 --> 20:46.767
Unless he's torturing
And watching the effects
On his victims.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.767
Part of the torture
Is psychological.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.834
That's another reason
He takes couples.

20:50.901 --> 20:54.934
Chances are he forces one
To watch his power
Over the other.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.267
Because only the women
Suffer sexual torture,

20:57.334 --> 20:59.667
He's most likely
A malignant misogynist.

20:59.734 --> 21:03.067
This typically stems
From an extreme hatred
Towards a woman

21:03.133 --> 21:07.267
Who was relentless
In her psychological
And physical abuse.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.200
How do you know the dad
Wasn't the abusive one

21:09.267 --> 21:11.133
And he's just
Continuing the cycle?

21:11.200 --> 21:14.033
Only a woman could make him
Hate women this much.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.200
The idea of
The "terrible mother"
Is best illustrated

21:16.267 --> 21:19.367
In world mythology
By the negative aspects
Of the great mother.

21:19.434 --> 21:21.868
Instead of nurturing her
Children, she destroyed him.

21:21.934 --> 21:23.934
And given
This upbringing,
It's highly unlikely

21:24.000 --> 21:25.501
He'd ever been
In a relationship,

21:25.567 --> 21:26.801
Let alone been married.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.067
And since he works
In the service industry,

21:28.133 --> 21:29.634
He's forced to deal
With a lot of people.

21:29.701 --> 21:31.467
So he can probably hide
His aversion to women

21:31.534 --> 21:33.467
Until he gets them
Behind closed doors.

21:33.534 --> 21:35.467
With that said,
We shouldn't rule out anyone

21:35.534 --> 21:37.334
With prior offenses
Toward women.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.300
Given the amount of time
He spends with his victims,

21:39.367 --> 21:41.434
He requires
A great deal of privacy.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.567
He may even utilize
An atv to get away

21:43.634 --> 21:45.200
From the accident sites,

21:45.267 --> 21:47.934
So the property may back up
Onto an off-road trail.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.734
We should therefore
Concentrate on the most
Remote motels first.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.300
Thank you.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.734
[creaking]

21:58.834 --> 22:01.434
[tapping]

22:13.234 --> 22:14.267
Aah!

22:14.334 --> 22:15.734
Oh, my god! Ian!

22:15.801 --> 22:18.434
Ohh! He was right there!

22:18.501 --> 22:20.400
[gasps]

22:22.701 --> 22:23.634
[grunting]

22:25.133 --> 22:27.767
You just watched
Me do that.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.400
You always second-guess me.

22:29.467 --> 22:32.100
Trust me,
It's not going to break.

22:32.167 --> 22:34.100
I'm always
Second-guessing you?

22:34.167 --> 22:35.100
Yeah.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.434
When?

22:36.501 --> 22:38.767
You want to get
Into this now?

22:41.133 --> 22:42.467
We never should
Have stopped.

22:42.534 --> 22:43.734
Oh, so it's my fault?

22:43.801 --> 22:45.767
No. I didn't--
I didn't say that.

22:45.834 --> 22:46.934
But you want to.
Go ahead.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.300
Fine. You know what?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.801
If you hadn't
Been hung over,

22:49.868 --> 22:51.801
We could've been on
The road a lot earlier.

22:51.868 --> 22:53.534
So it is my fault.

22:53.601 --> 22:55.200
No, it's mine.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.400
I should have
Cut you off.

22:57.467 --> 23:00.968
Sorry for enjoying
Myself on vacation.

23:01.033 --> 23:02.200
You should try it sometime.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.367
I have fun.

23:03.434 --> 23:04.901
I just don't
Have to be drunk.

23:04.968 --> 23:08.834
Once a year I have a few
Too many at dinner.

23:08.901 --> 23:12.000
Don't confuse me
With your father.

23:35.934 --> 23:38.334
Oh, my--ohh...

23:44.667 --> 23:46.367
Haven't seen them.

23:47.734 --> 23:50.000
How many employees
You got working here?

23:50.067 --> 23:53.000
I've got 11 people
On the payroll.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.534
You got a night manager?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.801
We rotate the shift.
Got a nice setup
In the back office.

23:58.868 --> 24:00.534
All the movie channels.

24:00.601 --> 24:03.033
Your employees, they have
Access to all these rooms?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.801
We all have
Master keys, yeah.

24:04.868 --> 24:07.734
I need to see a list
Of all of those names.

24:07.801 --> 24:08.734
Ok.

24:09.801 --> 24:12.367
You get a lot of people
Staying over?

24:12.434 --> 24:14.167
Some hard-core riders.

24:14.234 --> 24:15.801
Guys come up here
For a night or two.

24:15.868 --> 24:17.734
Ever get any couples?

24:17.801 --> 24:18.968
You know any girls
Who'd stay here?

24:19.033 --> 24:21.200
Yeah. I guess
It is a bit...

24:21.267 --> 24:22.834
Rustic.

24:22.901 --> 24:24.734
Yeah. They might get dirty.

24:26.567 --> 24:29.467
So the rentals
Keep you busy.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.901
Tourists, mainly.

24:30.968 --> 24:32.901
Most locals have their own.

24:32.968 --> 24:36.634
I imagine it's pretty easy
To get yourself turned
Around out there.

24:36.701 --> 24:38.067
I guess.

24:38.133 --> 24:42.033
But it's faster getting
Around on trails
Than on the roads.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.234
So, you run
This place alone?

24:45.300 --> 24:48.033
More work, more money.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.634
Do you mind
If I keep this?

24:50.701 --> 24:52.200
Help yourself.

24:52.267 --> 24:53.434
Thanks for your time.

25:05.834 --> 25:08.667
He's going to jam that thing
In your face again.

25:08.734 --> 25:09.934
I need some air.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.868
Do you want
To get hurt?

25:13.267 --> 25:14.868
Here we go.

25:14.934 --> 25:17.434
The silent treatment.

25:17.501 --> 25:21.067
You know what? It's two
Speeds with us lately, ian.

25:21.133 --> 25:23.601
We either lash out
Or we shut down.

25:23.667 --> 25:24.801
That's not true, ab.

25:24.868 --> 25:27.634
Really? Then what
Do you call this?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.234
[bell dings]

25:37.033 --> 25:38.067
Sorry about that.

25:38.133 --> 25:39.501
I was around back.

25:39.567 --> 25:41.767
Aaron hotchner, fbi.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.801
I'm wayne dryden.
I'm the manager.

25:43.868 --> 25:45.400
We're looking
For these people.

25:45.467 --> 25:46.734
Have you seen them?

25:46.801 --> 25:48.767
Their names are
Abby and ian corbin.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.934
They must have done
Something really bad

25:51.000 --> 25:52.834
To bring the fbi
All the way out here.

25:52.901 --> 25:55.734
They're missing.
Is there anyone else
Here who may have seen them?

25:55.801 --> 25:57.434
Well, it's just me
And the old lady.

25:57.501 --> 25:59.868
And she's down at the mall
For this hummel expo.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.868
She collects those things.
Do you know them?

26:01.934 --> 26:03.033
I've heard of them.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.467
She's got those things
Taking over my office.

26:05.534 --> 26:07.100
They are everywhere
In there.

26:07.167 --> 26:08.767
It's a sight.

26:08.834 --> 26:09.868
Can I help you, sir?

26:09.934 --> 26:10.868
Do you have any rooms?

26:10.934 --> 26:12.033
One moment, sir.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.367
If you see or hear anything,
Here's my card.

26:15.601 --> 26:17.267
Thank you.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.434
I hope you find who
You're looking for.

26:21.234 --> 26:23.367
I'm sorry, sir.
We have a full house.

26:23.434 --> 26:24.367
But you just said--

26:24.434 --> 26:25.834
No, I didn't.

26:25.901 --> 26:27.200
Well, you have any ideas
Where we could stay?

26:28.300 --> 26:31.834
Sure. You can drive back
Down the road...

26:31.901 --> 26:33.234
And if you turn left,

26:33.300 --> 26:35.000
There's about 200 places.

26:35.067 --> 26:37.567
And if you turn right,
There's about 199.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.467
[turns lock]

26:44.534 --> 26:46.567
It's already dark
And we've barely

26:46.634 --> 26:48.334
Gotten through
Half the motels.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.767
Maybe he's not
In the remote areas.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.434
You think he's
Hiding in the middle
Of everything?

26:51.501 --> 26:52.634
May be.

26:52.701 --> 26:54.167
Let's go.

26:54.234 --> 26:55.968
Wait, guys.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.601
Um, garcia found
A connection between
A motel handyman

26:58.667 --> 27:00.300
And rebecca gallen.

27:00.367 --> 27:01.901
They went to
High school together.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.133
So I thought maybe he was
Connected to the other victims.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.334
It turns out he's not,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.868
But there's something else
That all of the women
Have in common.

27:09.934 --> 27:13.667
Ok, rebecca gallen was found
In a bra, t-shirt,

27:13.734 --> 27:15.634
Skirt, and flip-flops.
Johanna dietrich

27:15.701 --> 27:17.701
In a dress and sandals.

27:17.767 --> 27:20.567
Melissa taylor was wearing
A bra, tank top, and jeans.

27:20.634 --> 27:22.667
None of them were
Wearing underwear.

27:22.734 --> 27:24.501
How do you know
It was taken?

27:24.567 --> 27:26.467
Because they all packed
It in their bags,

27:26.534 --> 27:28.901
But none were wearing it
During the collisions.

27:28.968 --> 27:32.868
He leaves his victims
In a car without
Their underwear

27:32.934 --> 27:34.901
And waits
For them to be hit.

27:34.968 --> 27:38.300
A violent collision
Of metal against flesh.

27:38.367 --> 27:42.267
It's like the accidents
Are the final rape.

27:42.334 --> 27:44.567
This sexual aspect
Didn't show up overnight.

27:44.634 --> 27:46.734
This is something
He's been building up to.

27:55.067 --> 27:57.667
What do you think
Your parents told them

27:57.734 --> 27:59.701
When we didn't come home?

28:02.634 --> 28:04.534
That we're
On an adventure.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.701
What's going
To happen to them?

28:08.767 --> 28:09.701
[boom]

28:09.767 --> 28:10.701
[crackling]

28:10.767 --> 28:12.033
Ian.
Abby.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.701
Abby, abby,
Are you ok?

28:13.767 --> 28:15.200
Yeah.

28:16.934 --> 28:18.367
What's he doing?

28:30.534 --> 28:31.701
Ian.

28:31.767 --> 28:32.868
What?

28:32.934 --> 28:33.901
Those aren't mine.

28:33.968 --> 28:35.901
He was just in here.

28:35.968 --> 28:37.901
Get behind me.

28:37.968 --> 28:41.000
Ian, I'm scared.

28:49.334 --> 28:50.968
So this guy
Sees these collisions

28:51.033 --> 28:52.434
As some kind of rape.

28:52.501 --> 28:54.968
We know that an underwear
Fetish typically begins

28:55.033 --> 28:57.534
In adolescence with peeping
In neighbors' windows.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.000
When that no longer
Satisfies them,

28:59.067 --> 29:00.167
They'll burglarize homes
And start taking

29:00.234 --> 29:01.367
The object that
Arouses them.

29:01.434 --> 29:02.934
If they get away
With that long enough,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.467
They become more confident.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.834
Then the object becomes
The woman wearing it.

29:06.901 --> 29:08.534
That's when
A rape can occur.

29:08.601 --> 29:10.267
The one constant
Is they always

29:10.334 --> 29:12.434
Take the underwear
As a souvenir.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.767
Is it possible a pervert like
This has ever been arrested?

29:14.834 --> 29:16.634
There's a good chance
That a serial sex offender

29:16.701 --> 29:18.667
With an underwear fetish
Has been caught before.

29:18.734 --> 29:19.767
Garcia: right again,
Agent hotchner.

29:19.834 --> 29:21.067
What is it, garcia?

29:21.133 --> 29:23.434
For the last 2 days I've been
Searching through vicap

29:23.501 --> 29:26.267
For similar rapes
And murders in cases
That are still open.

29:26.334 --> 29:27.801
That has yielded me
Diddley-squat.

29:27.868 --> 29:29.634
So I regrouped.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.167
I looked at some
Pictures of baby pandas.

29:31.234 --> 29:32.901
I went back in
And I started searching

29:32.968 --> 29:35.534
For similar rapes
And murders in cases
That had been solved. Ok?

29:35.601 --> 29:37.033
What did you find?

29:37.100 --> 29:39.667
5 months ago this guy
Named clint barnes

29:39.734 --> 29:41.300
Is convicted of 5 rapes

29:41.367 --> 29:44.067
That happened 30 miles
Away in selbyville.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.334
Now, what's interesting,

29:45.400 --> 29:48.434
And by interesting I also
Mean icky and sad and wrong,

29:48.501 --> 29:51.334
Is that mr. Barnes only stole
The undergarment

29:51.400 --> 29:53.934
Of his last victim,
And she was beaten in exactly

29:54.000 --> 29:56.200
The same manner
As our current victims.

29:56.267 --> 29:58.434
And she was
The only one who died.

29:58.501 --> 30:01.000
The first four showed
No signs of torture?

30:01.067 --> 30:02.968
According to statements
Made by the survivors, yes.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.567
Some questions
About his performance.

30:04.634 --> 30:06.968
Things like...
"did you enjoy it?"

30:07.033 --> 30:09.801
That sounds like a power
Reassurance rapist.

30:09.868 --> 30:11.834
That doesn't fit
His last crime at all.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.367
The last
Victim wasn't his.

30:15.267 --> 30:16.467
It was our unsub's.

30:16.534 --> 30:18.501
[grunting]

30:18.567 --> 30:19.667
Ian! Ian! Stop!

30:19.734 --> 30:22.667
Please! We need
To clean your hand.

30:22.734 --> 30:24.267
I'll be fine.

30:24.334 --> 30:25.267
You're cut pretty bad.

30:25.334 --> 30:26.267
I said I'll be fine.

30:27.567 --> 30:28.734
Ian, what are you doing?

30:28.801 --> 30:30.734
He got in here. There's
Got to be a way out.

30:30.801 --> 30:31.734
Ok.

30:31.801 --> 30:32.734
[grunting]

30:32.801 --> 30:35.434
Just--just slow down
For one second, ok?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.167
We gotta get out of here!

30:37.234 --> 30:38.400
I know, ian--oh!

30:38.467 --> 30:39.567
Uh!

30:39.634 --> 30:40.567
Abby?

30:40.634 --> 30:41.567
Ow.

30:41.634 --> 30:42.767
I'm so sorry.

30:42.834 --> 30:43.934
Are you ok?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.968
Abby...

30:46.033 --> 30:47.734
I didn't mean it.

30:47.801 --> 30:49.534
I know.

30:49.601 --> 30:51.067
I know you didn't mean it.

30:51.133 --> 30:52.801
What's happening?

30:52.868 --> 30:54.100
Ian.

30:54.167 --> 30:56.400
Just get us out of here.

30:56.467 --> 30:58.033
Now.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.701
Please.

30:59.767 --> 31:02.167
The way out has to be
In the bathroom.

31:06.601 --> 31:10.033
[crashing and grunting]

31:19.534 --> 31:21.033
[gasps]

31:23.734 --> 31:25.400
[gasps]

31:25.467 --> 31:27.601
Files rushed over
From the d.a.'s office.

31:27.667 --> 31:30.167
How many suspects did they
Have in the selbyville case?

31:30.234 --> 31:32.200
Let's see. Including
Clint barnes, it says

31:32.267 --> 31:33.968
They had about 10 other men
Who looked good for it.

31:34.033 --> 31:35.901
Brought in double that
For questioning.

31:35.968 --> 31:38.267
Jj, cross-reference
These names
Of selbyville suspects.

31:38.334 --> 31:39.601
See if you get
A match with people

31:39.667 --> 31:40.801
We still need
To talk to in sherwood.

31:40.868 --> 31:41.901
You got it.
You can use
My office.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.801
Almost all these guys
Had criminal records.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.734
Offenses range from spousal
Abuse, sex crimes,

31:45.801 --> 31:47.234
Molestation,
And attempted rape.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.901
Our unsub is using
Brutal physical force
And extreme violence.

31:49.968 --> 31:52.067
Look for somebody
Who's angry and hostile
Towards his victims.

31:52.133 --> 31:53.801
Look for an intellectual
Component.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.667
This guy used the m.o.
Of another rapist

31:55.734 --> 31:58.200
To make sure
The wrong person went
To jail for his crimes.

31:58.267 --> 32:00.300
The selbyville police
Talked to our unsub.

32:00.367 --> 32:01.868
He looked good
For these crimes.

32:01.934 --> 32:04.133
He's in here somewhere.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.133
[groaning]
You need to let us go.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.601
Now!

32:13.767 --> 32:16.868
People are waiting for us.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.334
If we're not home,

32:28.400 --> 32:29.934
They're going
To call the police.

32:31.767 --> 32:34.100
They have no idea
You're here.

32:34.167 --> 32:36.701
We told them we're
Staying in sherwood.

32:37.968 --> 32:40.067
Oh.

32:40.133 --> 32:44.567
That's not
What ian said when
He checked you in.

32:45.968 --> 32:47.968
What do you want?!

32:48.033 --> 32:50.734
Aah! [whimpering]

32:50.801 --> 32:53.067
I want to know...

32:53.133 --> 32:58.200
Why you are with a man who
Doesn't take care of you.

32:58.267 --> 33:02.934
And then, you let him push
You around like that.

33:12.601 --> 33:15.133
Have you ever wondered
What it's like

33:15.200 --> 33:16.767
To be with a real man?

33:16.834 --> 33:18.200
[crying]

33:18.267 --> 33:20.534
All right, garcia,
Let's try again.

33:20.601 --> 33:21.534
Go for it.

33:21.601 --> 33:22.868
Name's floyd hansen.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.434
Lived and worked in sherwood
His entire life.

33:24.501 --> 33:26.801
Went to jail at 25 for
Breaking and entering.

33:26.868 --> 33:29.167
Our friend got caught
Red-handed with some bloomers.

33:29.234 --> 33:30.868
Charged with attempted rape.

33:30.934 --> 33:32.767
Jerk served time,
Got out a year ago.

33:32.834 --> 33:34.801
His last known address
Is at the crest cottages.

33:34.868 --> 33:37.100
Jj, the list of hotels
And motels we went to--

33:37.167 --> 33:38.367
I interviewed
The manager there.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.968
His name's dryden, right?

33:40.033 --> 33:42.234
Uh...employee records
Say wayne dryden

33:42.300 --> 33:44.400
Was fired from the crest
Cottages 6 months ago.

33:44.467 --> 33:47.200
The only employee
Now is the owner...

33:47.267 --> 33:48.534
Floyd hansen.

34:01.767 --> 34:02.868
Abby?

34:07.968 --> 34:09.333
Let's go. I know
Where we're going.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.000
Jj, tell garcia we'll
Call her from the car.

34:18.634 --> 34:20.333
[groaning]

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
Abby.

34:22.467 --> 34:24.266
Wake up.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.766
Honey, what did
He do to you?

34:25.833 --> 34:27.900
[groaning]

34:27.967 --> 34:30.033
I'm going to kill
That son of a bitch.

34:31.234 --> 34:33.167
He said he'll be back.

34:33.234 --> 34:35.367
Abby...

34:35.434 --> 34:36.667
I love you.

34:36.734 --> 34:38.701
I'm going to get us
Out of here.

34:38.766 --> 34:40.900
Do you hear me?

34:40.967 --> 34:42.766
Abby?

34:50.266 --> 34:52.934
I should have
Taken my own advice
And gotten some rest.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.100
Hotch, we've talked
To so many people.
It could have been any of us.

34:55.167 --> 34:56.667
[cell phone rings]

34:56.734 --> 34:58.334
Hello?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.100
 Hello?

35:00.167 --> 35:01.601
Can you hear me, garcia?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.367
Yeah, that's better.
I can sort of hear you.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.534
So, like I was saying,
It's like floyd hansen
Didn't even have a chance.

35:05.601 --> 35:08.033
His mother drank herself
To death when he was 2.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.934
Father remarried,
To a prostitute.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.234
Where's his father now?

35:11.300 --> 35:12.767
He died 6 months ago.

35:12.834 --> 35:14.767
Floyd inherited the crest
Cottages from him and then--

35:14.834 --> 35:15.868
[static]

35:15.934 --> 35:17.634
Garcia?

35:17.701 --> 35:18.934
We lost her.

35:19.033 --> 35:21.100
Hello? Reid? Oh, man.

35:21.167 --> 35:22.801
Timeline fits. He gets
Out of jail a year ago,

35:22.868 --> 35:24.400
He's on good behavior
For a few months.

35:24.467 --> 35:25.934
But the urges
Are too strong.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.434
Rapes and kills a woman,
And he's smart enough

35:27.501 --> 35:28.934
To blame it on another guy.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.734
His father dies, he inherits
All the privacy,

35:31.801 --> 35:33.634
Control, and victims
He could ever need.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.367
It's loose.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.400
I got one. Look, ab.

35:44.467 --> 35:46.133
If I get one more--

35:47.934 --> 35:50.367
No. Don't you do that.

35:50.434 --> 35:51.734
Don't you give up on me.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.434
Abby, look at me.

35:54.501 --> 35:56.167
You can do this.

35:56.234 --> 35:58.200
We're going to do this.

35:58.267 --> 36:00.200
We're going to get
Out of here, abby.

36:01.334 --> 36:02.868
That would really
Be something.

36:05.667 --> 36:08.901
Because that hasn't
Happened yet.

36:08.968 --> 36:11.000
But this...

36:11.067 --> 36:13.667
This always happens.

36:13.734 --> 36:15.067
Uh! Oh. Easy.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.067
Uh!
Easy.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.100
Someone always gives up.

36:22.133 --> 36:26.634
I got to say,
I didn't think
It was gonna be you.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.901
I mean, I get it.

36:30.534 --> 36:31.634
You're tired.

36:31.701 --> 36:32.801
Leave her alone!

36:32.868 --> 36:34.501
I heard you're
Not a morning person,

36:34.567 --> 36:38.901
But what kind of man
Turns that down?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.467
You didn't touch
My pancakes,

36:44.534 --> 36:47.901
So you must be starving.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.667
And then there's him.

36:49.734 --> 36:53.267
He's supposed
To protect you.

36:53.334 --> 36:54.567
Isn't that the deal?

36:54.634 --> 36:58.234
Isn't that why you married
A big, strong man?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.934
So...

37:02.000 --> 37:05.667
Why did he just
Sit there the whole time?

37:05.734 --> 37:07.801
You son of a bitch.

37:07.868 --> 37:09.267
Uh!

37:09.334 --> 37:13.501
[gagging and coughing]

37:15.167 --> 37:17.601
There are 10 cabins
On 10 acres.

37:17.667 --> 37:18.968
There are maps
Outside the office.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.667
He's got a lot of privacy.
There's a garage,

37:20.734 --> 37:22.067
There's sheds,
There's stables...

37:22.133 --> 37:24.133
Why not keep them
In one of the cabins?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.400
We're going to have
To check everything.

37:25.467 --> 37:26.400
We'll look in here.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.000
Ok. Morgan, prentiss,
This way.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.601
He's been following
The investigation.

38:05.834 --> 38:08.100
He's been at this longer
Than we thought.

38:14.868 --> 38:15.801
[gasps, whimpers]

38:17.868 --> 38:19.534
Don't worry.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.133
When I'm done with her,

38:21.200 --> 38:23.300
It'll take the fight
Right out of you.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.100
Uhh!

38:32.167 --> 38:34.133
Uhh!

38:35.300 --> 38:37.634
Help me...

38:37.701 --> 38:38.934
Help! [screaming]

38:39.033 --> 38:41.067
Morgan, prentiss,
I'm at cabin 6.

38:41.133 --> 38:43.934
[screaming]

38:44.000 --> 38:45.734
[banging and grunting]

38:45.801 --> 38:47.601
Aah!
Uhh!

38:47.667 --> 38:48.601
No!

38:48.667 --> 38:49.601
Aah!

38:49.667 --> 38:51.667
No!
Aah!

38:53.234 --> 38:55.100
Fbi!

38:55.167 --> 38:56.300
Ian?

38:56.367 --> 38:57.834
He went through there.

38:57.901 --> 38:58.868
Morgan!
Ian!

39:06.467 --> 39:07.400
There.

39:10.467 --> 39:11.901
Are you ok?

39:11.968 --> 39:14.367
Ian?

39:14.434 --> 39:16.367
We need
An ambulance cabin 6.

39:16.434 --> 39:17.367
Is he ok?

39:17.434 --> 39:19.300
Is he ok?

39:19.367 --> 39:20.834
He's going to be ok.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.834
Ian...thank you.

40:00.534 --> 40:01.767
[horn blasting]

40:05.367 --> 40:06.801
[tires screeching]

40:27.868 --> 40:30.834
Well, roadside
Motels definitely
Go on my list.

40:30.901 --> 40:33.501
Of things
To never do again.

40:33.567 --> 40:34.501
You have a list?

40:34.567 --> 40:36.534
You don't?

40:36.601 --> 40:38.901
It's gonna take a while
To get this mess cleaned up.

40:38.968 --> 40:40.567
Well, it's going to take
A hell of a lot longer

40:40.634 --> 40:42.200
For that couple
To recover.

40:49.334 --> 40:52.434
I wonder if this place
Was ever nice.

40:55.701 --> 40:57.167
I was here.

40:57.234 --> 40:59.868
I talked to him
And I didn't see it.

40:59.934 --> 41:03.300
He made himself look
Like a good guy.

41:03.367 --> 41:04.634
You bought it.

41:04.701 --> 41:05.801
It happens.

41:05.868 --> 41:08.400
To the best of us.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.133
Welcome to the club.

41:22.367 --> 41:24.601
Hotch:
Roman poet phaedrus wrote,

41:24.667 --> 41:26.567
"things are not always
What they seem.

41:26.634 --> 41:28.968
"the first appearance
Deceives many.

41:29.033 --> 41:31.133
"the intelligence of a few

41:31.200 --> 41:34.234
Perceives what has
Been carefully hidden."
