WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.950
CARTER: Previously, on Eureka.

00:03.086 --> 00:05.213
Come on, Josefina.
Don't go all serious
on me, now.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.545
It's too late.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.925
JO: Thorne dug up
an old bomb-testing facility?

00:09.051 --> 00:10.131
CARTER: What's
down there, anyway?

00:10.260 --> 00:12.672
ALLISON: Well, nothing
for long. She ordered
a thermal cleaning.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.886
FARGO: She redacted
all the photos
of Eureka's founders.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.301
ALLISON: Oh, my God,
are those...
ZANE: Bodies?

00:17.434 --> 00:19.299
THORNE: History has a way
of haunting you.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.974
This is part of mine,
and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.780
So,pany
at Pilar's tonight?

00:33.909 --> 00:36.241
(SIGHS) Doubtful.
My morning shift
felt like a double.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.611
In fact, I'm about
as energetic
as this dishrag.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.113
Which is why
you need some fun.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.239
(GIGGLES)

00:45.462 --> 00:46.451
(CUP BANGING ON TABLE)

00:46.588 --> 00:48.089
(CARTER CLEARING THROAT)

00:50.050 --> 00:52.006
It's okay. Get up.
Get up.

00:52.135 --> 00:56.299
I'll just, uh, lwill just,
uh, sit here,
till you are finished.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.972
Why do dads
ruin everything?

01:03.105 --> 01:05.938
'Cause they're men,
and men are ruiners.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.356
Um, Zane drama?

01:08.986 --> 01:12.103
No.Feah
Okay, never date a coward.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.861
I put myself out there,
commitment-wise

01:15.993 --> 01:17.984
(INHALES DEEPLY)
and he froze.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.369
We haven't talked since.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.489
Well, here's your chance.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.789
Hey, Jo.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.416
(TAPPING ON TABLE)

01:30.882 --> 01:32.463
You, uh, eat, yet?

01:34.052 --> 01:37.715
(STUTTERING) I thought maybe
we could, you know,
we could have a bite.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.215
(LAUGHING) A bite. Well,
we wouldn't want you
to commit to a whole meal.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.178
You got something to say?

01:43.312 --> 01:46.224
I already did,
and you couldn't handle it.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.143
Hi, Ruiner.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.525
You know, if we're ever
gonna find out why
Thorne moved those bodies,

01:55.657 --> 01:56.863
we're gonna have to
search the bunker.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.983
Well, stopping the thermal
cleaning didn't slow her down.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.575
She's pulled in
an outside contractor.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.285
What kind of
outside contractor?

02:02.414 --> 02:04.245
Uh, I'm not sure.
His name is Hendricks.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.239
He's set himself up in
a trailer near the bunker.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.162
That's all I could find out,
but I know he has something

02:08.295 --> 02:09.580
to do with what
she's trying to hide.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.829
Hmm.
And she's moving
those bodies.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.627
(GROANS) We have to autopsy
those bodies in order
to discover

02:14.760 --> 02:16.216
their cause of death
and ID.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.006
Well, ID-ing them
is going to be difficult.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.301
She's redacted every
personnel record
and photo from 1939,

02:21.433 --> 02:23.594
even the ones
that were on that wall.

02:23.727 --> 02:27.936
Why would anybody want
photos of scientists
and founders of Eureka.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.977
Yeah, I mean, somebody
on that wall's got to
be part of the answer.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.486
Well, we're never
gonna know
without those photos.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.853
Wait. Photo, the photo...

02:35.989 --> 02:38.731
Hey, Vince! Remember the day
of the campaigns speeches?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.698
You were taking photos
in front of that wall, right?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.034
Yeah, you mean the ones
where I looked like Sasquatch?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.403
Yes, those are the ones.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.667
(HENRY CHUCKLING)
Thanks. I think
Fargo has them.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.869
(CLEARING THROAT)
Great. Um,
okay. I'll talk to Fargo.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.506
I'll get Jo to check
on Thorne's guy.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.247
And, Allison, we have
to have those bodies.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.590
Okay.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.886
All right, Dr. Hendricks,
you sure you have
enough material?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.506
Trust me, Miss Thorne.
I'm very good at what I do.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.726
That's why I called you in.
How long before
everything's in place?

03:07.854 --> 03:10.231
As long as it takes.
Look, this bunker
is massive,

03:10.357 --> 03:11.893
and you don't want to
make a mistake
with this stuff.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.437
Fine, but we need
this completed
as soon as possible.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.821
I'll be happy to get you
any help you need.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.030
Look, this is a delicate
operation. I would prefer
to do it myself.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.864
We only have one shot.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.491
Take it quickly.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.156
(TRUCK DOOR CLOSING)

03:30.919 --> 03:34.286
Dr. Hendricks,
it's the police.
I need to speak with you.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.089
Thanks, Carter.
That was pointless.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.635
ZANE: Huh.
Found you.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.055
How'd you get here?

03:46.143 --> 03:48.008
I road my bike.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.558
And just so you know,
this passive-aggressive
thing is really annoying.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.397
Well, you want to try
just aggressive?

03:54.818 --> 03:57.184
Uh, no, not really.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.060
I didn't think so.
See ya.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.991
Hey, could you come here
for a second?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.415
Why? So you can
hit me with that?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.036
Not until you tell me
what it is, first.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.122
Please?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.078
(SIGHING)

04:23.513 --> 04:26.175
Anodized aluminum
with a trap valve.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.303
Okay,
and that means...

04:29.436 --> 04:31.347
It's a pressurized container
of some kind.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.469
Hmm.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.062
It's got a remote trigger.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.018
For what?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.475
To set it off at a distance.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.980
You wouldn't want to be
anywhere near this
when it went off.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.404
You could pack a hell
of a lot of something
into a device like this.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.827
How much could you pack
in about 1,000 of them?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.922
FARGO: Some of us
actually work for a living,
you know?

05:08.058 --> 05:10.390
Yeah, I didn't want to do this
on the G.D. system.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.386
Well, you owe me a lunch hour,
and you mind turning around?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.262
I have some personal
photos on here.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.808
Oh, got you.
Sure.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.644
All right, let's see.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.354
(EXCLAIMS) Not it.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.238
(EXCLAIMS) Not it.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.027
Not it. Definitely, not it.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.156
That's a good look.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.776
Whoa! What?
No! Personal!
Don't you understand?

05:31.540 --> 05:33.155
All right. Okay, here we go.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.249
Great. Um, can you zoom
in on the photos
in the background?

05:36.378 --> 05:38.994
Not on this dinosaur,
and since I can't
do it at G.D.,

05:39.130 --> 05:41.542
I'm gonna have to do it
when I get home later tonight.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.291
Fargo, this is important.
You're gonna have to
go home, now.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.840
Bet Dr. Blake won't like me
bending the rules like this.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.300
Uh, you'd be surprised.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.647
Oh! Great. Um, Miss Thorne
wanted me to double check
the delivery address

05:58.775 --> 06:01.061
on this shipment
from the morgue.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.563
One sec. Great, thanks.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.156
You're welcome.
All right, let's go.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.490
ZOE: I'll never make fun
of Aunt Lexi again.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.328
I feel like I'm pregnant
with twins.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.914
(GROANS) Don't ever say
the "P" word in front
of your dad.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.999
He'll lock me up
and throw away the key.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.539
I feel like he's always
watching me.

06:20.672 --> 06:24.005
(GROANS) If I weren't
so tired, I'd tell you
to stop being so paranoid.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.457
(ALARM BEEPING)

06:26.595 --> 06:28.085

06:58.168 --> 07:00.204
Sarah, turn off security,
right now!

07:00.337 --> 07:04.000
SARAH: I can't, Sheriff.
The intruder is an imposter,
not Zoe Carter.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.589
Zoe and I walked in,
and SARAH went insane.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.334
Because, the unidentified
intruder is not Zoe.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.506

Honey, you okay?

07:20.231 --> 07:22.847
I think so. Did you
set a trap for Lucas?

07:22.984 --> 07:25.396
No, there's just
something wrong with SARAH.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.689
Yeah, what's wrong is
living in a house
that can Taser you.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.811
Yeah.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.281
No, she didn't hurt me.
Ijust got really dizzy.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.115
All right, well,
I think you should go
to the infirmary.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.451
No, Dad, really, I'm fine.
I've just been run down.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.990
It's no big deal.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.121
ls SARAH dead?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.373
(GROANING)

07:41.503 --> 07:43.368
Uh, no. Wejust
powered her down.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.120
Fargo's gonna run
a full system check.

07:45.256 --> 07:49.215
And Zoe and I are gonna go
to Cafe Diem, until he figures
out why she turned on us.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.834
Okay. You sure
you're okay?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.836
(SIGHS) Are you sure
you didn't zap my boyfriend?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.510
(EXCLAIMS)
She's fine.
Yeah.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.978
(SIGHING)

08:05.944 --> 08:08.310
HENRY: Nice job getting
these bodies out of G.D.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.062
Yeah, you know that
Eva's gonna be able to track
your ID off that scanner...

08:11.199 --> 08:12.905
Which is why
we need to hurry.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.275
All right. Let's find out
about our friend.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.029
(GASPS) Oh.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.542
(EXCLAIMS)
Are you all right?

08:21.668 --> 08:22.657
Um...

08:22.794 --> 08:24.580
Since when are you
the squeamish sort?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.620
(SIGHING) I'm not.
I'mjust, um...

08:26.756 --> 08:31.090
Just worn out.
Really, I'm fine.
Let's just get started.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.098
That one's almost empty,
but I was able to
analyze the leakage.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.934
Around the nozzle.
It's some kind of cement.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.975
Well, somebody know
what Hendricks is doing
with about 1,000 of them?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.939
No idea.
Why don't you ask him?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.024
And while you're at it,
find out why it has
a remote trigger.

08:49.154 --> 08:49.984
(GROANING)

08:50.113 --> 08:51.102
(HISSING)

08:54.117 --> 08:56.950
There's also
a manual release.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.454
I see that.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.459
I'm stuck.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.918
Yeah. We're stuck.
Together.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.543
I'll find Hendricks.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.916
Thank you.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.089
Perfect.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.609
Hi!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.653
Uh, busy day?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.070
Yeah. Yeah, it's a...
Not much time to talk.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.825
I'm sorry. Who are you?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.785
Oh, uh, Sheriff Carter.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.372
I thought access down here
from the highway
was supposed to be blocked.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.992
Yeah. I had to take
the scenic route.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.703
Okay. Is there something
I can help you with, Sheriff?

09:49.839 --> 09:53.878
Well, it's just that I don't
know you, and you've,
you've closed down a road,

09:54.010 --> 09:57.923
and you've got a ton of this
freakish instant cement, so...

09:58.973 --> 10:00.929
This is an authorized
military operation.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.675
Oh, yes, yes! I know! No!
Authorized by Eva Thorne!

10:03.812 --> 10:05.518
I know.

10:05.647 --> 10:09.811
(SIGHS) Look you seem
like a really nice guy, but,
I can't tell you anything.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.145
Fair enough.
How about I tell you
things, then?

10:12.278 --> 10:15.236
(STUTTERING) There's
an abandoned
underground facility.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.983
You're loading in about
1,000 canisters of that stuff,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.202
and all with
America's Sweetheart
behind it.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.951
You're very perceptive.
Yeah, she's a piece of work,
that one.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.952
(GASPS) But, I think
she's gonna take a few
pieces out of me,

10:30.088 --> 10:31.749
if I tell you
what I'm doing.

10:31.881 --> 10:36.250
Okay. Um, could you tell me
when you're gonna be
done doing it?

10:36.386 --> 10:37.751
Just so I know
when the road's
gonna be clear?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.503
Oh, yeah, I think
we'll be done end of
the workday tomorrow.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.553
Great! Thanks. Oh!
Um, one more thing.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.765
What if someone made
the very understandable
mistake of, um,

10:50.900 --> 10:52.686
opening one of the canisters,

10:52.819 --> 10:57.028
and then someone else
got their feet caught
in your super-goo?

10:57.240 --> 11:02.075
It's called Instantanium.
It's a nano-polymer,
syntactic foam.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.410
You know what that means?

11:04.539 --> 11:09.124
Uh, well, no.
But, how do we
get them out?

11:09.377 --> 11:10.913
You get a saw.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.544
Great! So, you can
just cut through it?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.789
No, you cut
through their legs.

Don't you look at me
in that tone of voice.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.018
This isn't my fault. Okay.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.863
Let me guess,
you two are still
stuck together.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.983
Just till I can
reach my gun.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.156
What'd you find out
from Hendricks?

11:46.289 --> 11:50.123
Uh, it's called Instantanium.
Some sort of hardening foam.

11:50.251 --> 11:54.085
No, nano-elastic foam.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.296

syntactic foam?
Yes!

11:56.424 --> 11:57.960
Wow.
What wow?

11:58.092 --> 12:00.925
Uh, nano-particles are bound
together at a molecular level.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.294
Aha.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.092
Uh, did Hendricks have any
idea how to get out of it?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.809
Uh, one, but you're not
gonna want to try it.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.727
I've slept in teepees,
huts, yurts.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.850
(SIGHS) I'd take a bed
of nails right now.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.979
Okay, I know why I'm tired.
I'm sleeping for the boys.
What's your excuse?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.855
(GROANS) I think I'm coming
down with something.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.983
Every bone in my body aches.

12:25.119 --> 12:25.983

like to be 30?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.736

I'll forgive you
for that in 15 years.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.862
(LAUGHS)

12:30.083 --> 12:31.948
But, you do look
a little pale.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.703
Hey. Smart House
is up and running.
Everything's fine.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.830
For a house that occasionally
takes you hostage?

12:38.967 --> 12:40.082
It was an honest mistake.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.709
Zoe's DNA didn't match
the sample
in SARAH's database.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.972
Well, it's not like
I went out and changed it.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.431
Well, maybe it was
a memory glitch. Uh,
either way, I reset her,

12:48.559 --> 12:49.639
and it won't happen again.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.725
So, we get to sleep
in real beds, now?
Yep.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.469
With real pillows?
You're all set for the house.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.188
Oh! Uh, and tell your dad
it took me a while
to enhance them,

12:56.317 --> 12:59.059
but I am a Photoshop god,
so I got those old pictures
he wanted...

12:59.195 --> 13:01.026
I love old pictures.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.859
The sheriff was interested
in which ones?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.357
Um, the ones
on the wall...

13:05.493 --> 13:06.949
Of my grandfather's house.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.660
He has this one with
Mickey Mantle, and I always
promised I'd get it restored,

13:09.789 --> 13:13.122
so, thanks, Fargo.
I'll pick 'em up later.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.367
Okee-dokee.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.243
So, can I buy you
some ice cream?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.711
I'm pressed for time, now.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.832
Oh, you're checking on
that Hendricks guy down
in the bunker.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.174
That's a big job
you gave him.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.292
That's classified.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.796
Yeah, that's what he said.
He said it's some part
of some big military project.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.672
That's right.
Oh, and I checked
with Mansfield,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.891
and he said that it isn't
a big military project.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.009
You spoke to the general?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.807
Yeah. He usually doesn't
take my calls,
but I used your name,

13:34.939 --> 13:37.555
and he picked right up.
It was awesome.
I hope you don't mind.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.478
I mind just about
everything you do, Sheriff,

13:39.610 --> 13:42.397
especially when you stick
your nose into somebody
else's business.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.772
Well, dead bodies
are always my business.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.033
Anyway, the General
says hi, and he can't
wait to be briefed

13:49.162 --> 13:50.527
about the
underground facility.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.948
Seems he didn't even
know a thing about it.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.946
Well, apparently,
he does, now.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.459
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.621
Miss Thorne, I'm just
looking for the truth.

14:01.716 --> 14:05.083
Sometimes, the truth
needs to be left alone,

14:05.345 --> 14:08.212
but you've made that
impossible, now,
haven't you, Sheriff?

14:11.309 --> 14:12.799
Yes, I have.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.727
Henry? Tell me
you found something!

14:24.864 --> 14:27.276
Yeah, I found something,
all right.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.776
These men did not
die of natural causes.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.028
Awesome! Um, not for them.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.871
Well, definitely, not
for them. They're death
was accelerated,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.661
brutally, rapid aging.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.331
Every cell in their body
went through an
entire life cycle

14:40.463 --> 14:41.919
in a compressed
period of time.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.165
Something was introduced
to their system that
killed them in a month.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.586
You think they
were poisoned?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.882
Uh, could be. I don't know.
I'm trying to identify
the elemental base

14:50.014 --> 14:52.926
of the pathogen.
It's something I've
never seen before.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.309
Look at that, 40 to 90
in a month.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.019
Now, does that
look natural to you?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.639
Well, Henry, if you can prove
that they didn't die
of natural causes,

15:01.776 --> 15:03.812
then I can investigate,
and if! can investigate,

15:03.945 --> 15:06.357
then I can stop Thorne
from sealing the bunker.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.695
I can try.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.064
All right.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.830
JO: God, what if! have
to go to the bathroom?

15:14.956 --> 15:18.289
Why do you think I'm working
so fast? I had four cups
of coffee this morning.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.407
(SIGHING)

15:22.046 --> 15:23.752
This isn't so bad.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.464
Hey, guys. Pick out
a china pattern, yet?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.627
(LAUGH MOCKINGLY)

15:27.760 --> 15:29.921
No, wait. Hold on.
I need Jo for a second.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.840
I'm kind of busy right now,
and that means that...

15:31.973 --> 15:33.838
My job is less
important than yours?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.557
Well, that depends.
Can you do it with one leg?

15:36.686 --> 15:37.675
(THUMPING)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.060
Good times.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.230
SARAH: I have an array
of exotic flavors for you
to choose from.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.321
I chose them specifically
based on the regions
you've traveled.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.157
The fact that a house
can actually try
to suck up to me

15:53.286 --> 15:57.325
is almost as disturbing as a
house taking my niece hostage.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.119
I'm still indicating
that her DNA has changed.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.366
ZOE: Aunt Lexi?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.879
(SIGHING) Great.
Just when she's
finally getting some sleep.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.121
Yeah? Here.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.630
Aunt Lexi, are you there?

16:09.093 --> 16:12.005
Yeah, I'm right here.
Are you okay?

16:12.138 --> 16:12.968
(GASPS)

16:13.097 --> 16:15.474
There's something
wrong with my eyes,

16:16.434 --> 16:18.095
(SIGHS)
I can't see.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.099
All clear.
No one left inside.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.312
Good.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.897
You really know
how to work a man.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.988
So I've been told.
Everything set?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.903
This place will be
an lnstantanium fortress,

16:35.036 --> 16:36.992
every entrance
five feet thick
with the stuff.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.498
Now, the facility itself
will stay clean,
like you asked,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.410
(GASPS)
With you rushing me,
though,

16:41.542 --> 16:43.828
I can't promise
a smooth detonation.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.950
Meaning?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.918
(SIGHS)
Look, underground job
like this

16:47.048 --> 16:48.913
needs to be
calibrated precisely,

16:49.050 --> 16:51.837
so the geological foundation
of the place isn't disturbed,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.844
and moving the operation
a day up on me,

16:54.972 --> 16:57.088
you might feel
a few little quakes.

16:57.225 --> 17:00.809
You sure it'll be impossible
to reopen once it's triggered?

17:00.937 --> 17:03.223
Nothing breaks
my Instantanium.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.480
Thank you, Dr. Hendricks.
I'll take it from here.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.894
Well, you're not
going back in there?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.938
I just have a few
things to take care of.

17:10.071 --> 17:15.907
Okay, but once this goes,
anything still in there
is never getting out.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.199
If Hendricks seals
the facility before we get
a warrant, we're screwed.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.748
It's a big place.
Uh, there's got to be
a weak spot.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.120
Guys, look, could Ijust
get to my...

17:29.257 --> 17:31.122
CARTER: If wind out
where it is and
we protect it...

17:31.259 --> 17:32.544
JO: We can get in later.
CARTER: Right.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.757
Can we just...

17:33.886 --> 17:37.003
So, okay, take a closer look
right over here. Right?
There's an air shaft.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.390
Do you see it?
Mmm-hmm.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.427
I think it goes down
to the second level.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.348
HENRY: Cataracts.
Easy to get rid of,
nowadays,

17:44.480 --> 17:47.847
especially with our prototype.
She's gonna be as good as new.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.349
(SIGHS)

17:49.485 --> 17:51.726
Wow. You're gonna be
able to see again, soon.

17:51.988 --> 17:52.898
How did this happen?

17:53.030 --> 17:56.193
SARAH's lasers, really bad
for the eyes. Can I talk
to you for a second?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.940
Sure. Sure.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.535
It wasn't lasers, Henry.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.124
You get cataracts
when you're old,
not when you're 17.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.834
Yes.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.955
Tell me it doesn't have
anything to do with
how those three men died.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.251
(SIGHS)

18:13.384 --> 18:16.501
SARAH was right.
Zoe's DNA has changed.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.549
Every cell in her body
is beginning to age, rapidly.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.048
Now, if she has the same
thing as those men,
there's only one place

18:22.184 --> 18:23.310
she could have gotten it.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.267
The bunker.
Yes.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.304
(SIGHING) Um...

18:29.692 --> 18:30.932
She hurt her ankle
when she was down there.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.777
She slipped in some, uh,
purple liquid.
Could that be it?

18:34.905 --> 18:35.815
I need a sample.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.779
All right. I'll get you
a sample. Do you mind
staying with her?

18:37.908 --> 18:41.116
Yeah, sure. Listen, G.D.'s
done a lot of work on
arresting cell degeneration.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.237
I've even put
a team together,
so try not to worry.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.362
Yeah.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.991
Sheriff, I have that picture.
Listen, now's not
a good time...

18:49.128 --> 18:51.494
No, no, you need
to see this.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.963
That's impossible.

18:59.096 --> 19:02.179
Well, sometimes impossible
answers a lot of questions.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.049
Don't touch the pretty,
metal canisters.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.466
(DOOR OPENING)

19:56.362 --> 19:59.024
(SIGHS)
Shenﬁ?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.321
You need to get
out of here, now.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.238
Sure, once you tell me
what's going on.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.573
What?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.617
That stuff you're
trying to hide,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.908
it killed those three men,
and now Zoe's been exposed.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.033
That's not possible.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.751
She slipped in it
when she was lost down here.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.541
Now, it's changed her DNA.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.043
Oh, my God.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.672
If that's true, we've got to
get out of here as fast
as we can.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.968
Nice try,
but I spoke to Hendricks.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.762
He's not sealing this
place until tomorrow.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.478
No. No! When you called
Mansfield, I had it
accelerated.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.346
We got to get to
the air shaft!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.352
(EXPLODING)

20:48.622 --> 20:50.328
That was our
only way out.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.450
Great.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.087
So, you knew this
was gonna happen?

21:09.143 --> 21:11.008
Why are you down
here?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.140
I wanted to end it,
all of it.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.101
Including me.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.862
I should have done it
a long time ago, but
I didn't have the courage.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.901
What are you
talking about?

21:29.038 --> 21:32.576
Courage to, what? To, to...

21:34.627 --> 21:38.586
Courage to cover up
how those men died?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.168
Yeah.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.666
What did you do to them?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.543
I didn't do anything to them.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.595
They died 70 years ago,
I wasn't even born.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.009
Well...

21:52.353 --> 21:54.059
Try again.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.565
This is one of the pictures
you took out of Cafe Diem.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.488
That's you.

22:03.614 --> 22:08.233
You were here in 1939,
with them.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.575
I was.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.126
But I didn't hurt them.
I just couldn't help them.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.834
So...

22:22.967 --> 22:25.583
I'm 107 years old.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.964
Why didn't you
die like them?

22:32.059 --> 22:35.051
I don't know.
I'm the only one.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.683
Well, now, you have
a chance to fix this.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.646
I mean, Zoe's not lucky
like you. She's like them.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.982
She's gonna suffer,
unless you tell me everything
that you know.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.817
I know. We're here.
We're stuck here.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.062
Well, I'm not dead, yet,
and neither are you!

22:46.198 --> 22:50.111
So, we're gonna find a way.
We're not letting Zoe die.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.575
Here you go.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.995
Wow. Good eats in this town.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.915
Glad you think so.
You'll be staying
a while longer.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.296
(SIGHING)

23:05.426 --> 23:06.541
(DOOR SLIDING)

23:12.975 --> 23:15.261
We set off the first
atomic bomb here.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.180
Oh, no, no.
First atomic bomb
was um...

23:17.313 --> 23:18.553
Los Alamos?

23:18.689 --> 23:21.852
They learned from our mistakes
and went with plutonium.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.272
We used a rare element
found only in
certain meteorites.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.566
The first test was flawless,

23:28.991 --> 23:34.111
but it created a certain,
unique byproduct
in the blast chamber.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.947
The, uh, purple stuff,
the, the stuff Henry
couldn't identify.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.459
Element X.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.875
They asked the team
to study it.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.835
There were only
four of us exposed,

23:43.964 --> 23:46.080
but nobody knew its effects,
until it was too late.

23:46.216 --> 23:50.300
So, why did they age,
and you didn't?

23:50.429 --> 23:55.173
DNA hadn't even been
discovered yet, but Jimmy
knew that, genetically,

23:55.309 --> 23:56.890
I was one-in-a-million.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.384
Sorry, Jimmy is?

23:58.896 --> 24:01.057
Perkins. He was
the team leader.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.931
(EXCLAIMS)
Along with
Blackman and Ross.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.690
And you?

24:05.819 --> 24:09.152
Well, I was a lab assistant,
best a girl could hope
for in those days.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.236
(LAUGHS)

24:10.366 --> 24:13.403
But, Jimmy insisted that
I keep my exposure a secret,

24:13.535 --> 24:14.945
so I wouldn't have to
do what they did.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.615
Bury themselves down here?

24:16.747 --> 24:21.366
Yes. They locked it all away,
the element,
the whole project,

24:21.585 --> 24:23.371
and they were
so close to a cure.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.664
How do you know that?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.708
I read their paperwork.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.129
They worked on it, every day,
for the rest of their lives.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.510
28 days.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.260
(STUTTERING) 28 days?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.141
Zoe was exposed to the stuff
seven days ago.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.981
This place is amazing.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.850
All right, look, you got
the right dissolving
chain here,

24:47.987 --> 24:50.148
but you're gonna need
Francium 227Ac,

24:50.280 --> 24:52.692
and there's less than
an ounce of that on Earth.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.316
Yeah, except for
the stash here at G.D.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.158
You're kidding, right?

24:58.747 --> 24:59.862
I'll order it up.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.741
(JO EXCLAIMS)
But, we'll only be able
to make up a few milligrams.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.002
(THUMPING)

25:04.128 --> 25:07.291
We're getting a series
of small earthquakes around
the underground facility.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.503
Any idea why?

25:08.632 --> 25:10.918
Hey, I told her
that would happen
if she rushed the job.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.382
Wait, you mean
you've already sealed it?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.012
Yeah, about an hour ago.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.046
(SIGHING) Oh, Carter!

25:19.101 --> 25:21.057
I put all their
papers in here.

25:21.979 --> 25:22.809
What am I looking for?

25:22.938 --> 25:26.601
Notes, papers, journals,
anything that can
help Henry save Zoe.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.851
Hitler was already
marching across Europe.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.729
Imagine if he'd gotten
his hands on our
bomb research.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.229
(CREAKING)

25:34.366 --> 25:36.778
(EXCLAIMS) It would be
Volkswagens everywhere.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.986
So, why come back?
I mean, why notjust
keep it all hidden?

25:40.414 --> 25:43.201
I tried to move on,
have a life.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.664
Things changed for women.
I made something of myself.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.797
Fate catches up with you,
no matter how far you run.

25:52.176 --> 25:56.089
I did so well,
I became the best person
for the job at G.D.

25:56.430 --> 25:59.422
I've spent a lifetime
trying to forget this place,

26:00.601 --> 26:02.216
but I needed to know.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.138
CARTER: Because, your name
isn't Eva Thorne.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.101
It's Mary Perkins.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.857
Jimmy was my brother.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.205
If I had known that Zoe
would have found
her way down here,

26:25.334 --> 26:27.871
I never would have
opened this place up again.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.289
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna help her.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.209
Even if we find the cure,
we can't get out of here.

26:33.342 --> 26:37.802
Well, you believed
in your team,
I believe in mine.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.804
So, next step,
we need some of that liquid.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.850
We'll, there's a...
There's a storage pool
in the cooling chamber.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.013
Great.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.477
Follow me.

26:49.942 --> 26:54.106
This solvent might work.
Just FYI, there's a chance
of a slight explosion.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.569
No, wait, explosion?

26:55.697 --> 26:57.278
Just do it.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.869
(GROANING)

27:13.966 --> 27:15.251
Thank God!

27:15.384 --> 27:16.794
Oh, look, it worked!
You're free!

27:16.927 --> 27:20.260
Yes, and in another
five minutes, I would have
chewed off my own leg!

27:20.389 --> 27:22.300
Your mouth is
probably big enough.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.385
How much longer, Fargo?

27:24.518 --> 27:26.258
The bunker's computers
are 70 years old.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.602
It's like teaching Lincoln
how to use an iPhone.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.810
All right, just get us
a signal down there.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.430
We need to know
if Carter's okay.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.182
Easier said than done.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.941
How's Zoe?

27:35.070 --> 27:37.561
Uh, tired, but stable.

27:37.698 --> 27:41.407
I was able to identify
the DNA marker that that,
uh, purple element affects.

27:41.535 --> 27:45.153
I just need more of it,
so that I can test
the reversal process.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.870
But, there is gonna come
a point of no return,

27:46.999 --> 27:48.455
when her body
won't be able to bounce back

27:48.584 --> 27:51.451
from whatever aging
she's already experienced.

27:51.587 --> 27:56.798
(EXCLAIMS) Henry, listen,
I have been feeling exhausted,
not a normal kind of tired.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.506
I was down there,
too, you know.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.136
Well, then,
I want you tested.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.177
(SIGHS)

28:04.016 --> 28:07.429
This room would
have been buried,
if you hadn't cut the wire.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.177
Yeah, what is
all this stuff, anyway?

28:10.439 --> 28:13.556
It was too dangerous
to enter the cooling chamber,

28:13.692 --> 28:17.401
so we had a video system
installed to monitor
the liquid level.

28:17.529 --> 28:21.067
We were working with
atom bombs for the first time.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.445
We didn't want the radiation
to seep into the groundwater.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.114
Is, is this
the storage pool.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.074
Yes.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.367
(THUNDERING)

28:31.710 --> 28:35.294
It looks like the
lnstantanium's cracked
the base of the storage pool.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.581
It's leaking out underneath.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.426
If it reaches the groundwater
and gets into the Eureka
drinking system...

28:42.554 --> 28:45.546
Eureka's gonna get
very old, very fast.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.231

make it of here,

28:53.357 --> 28:56.394
Henry doesn't have enough
purple stuff to make a cure.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.391
We need to
save your daughter.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.197
Yes. We do.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.664
I've had this
for a long time.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.130
My brother thought
I might need it one day.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.962
Zoe needs it more.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.351
What about you?

29:41.405 --> 29:45.068
I'd rather save somebody
now, than hold onto it
for a lifetime.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.037
We have to figure out
how to get out of here.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.251
I know this was a rushed job,
but I did seal
the entire facility.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.962
You know, every fortified
position has its weak point.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.924
I'm thinking yours is down
at the bottom of that
ventilation shaft.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.259
You might know that,
but how does
Carter know that?

30:06.388 --> 30:08.629
We looked at the
same schematic.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.972
Yeah, when, when two people
really know each other,

30:11.101 --> 30:12.682
then they're in sync,
and when they're partners...

30:12.811 --> 30:15.427
I get it. Could you just
drive the car, please?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.688
Now, I can't believe
this shaft was here
the whole time.

as a capped well.

our best bet.

what's going on down here.

at the same plans.

30:46.011 --> 30:50.345
We identified the
same weak points,
and this was the weakest.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.473
That's why you tried
to clear all the
canisters in this room?

30:53.602 --> 30:55.888
Yeah, but I missed one.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.934

one thing between us
and the air shaft.

that the testing on
Eva Thorne continue.

will it take you to make
enough for the whole town?

33:26.296 --> 33:27.832
I can't.

All I can find here
are designs for some

for a solution.

was the solution.

that the bomb did create
a lot of, uh,

They were talking
20, 30 kilotons.

That's enough to
irradiate 10 square miles.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.246
Okay. Will that
fix the town?

34:03.375 --> 34:06.742
Well, a range like that would
certainly reach the aquifer.
I mean, it might work.

Sure, if they actually built
the thing. It doesn't say
how far they got.

wasted the time.

34:51.381 --> 34:54.623
Yep. A really big bomb.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.420
ALLISON: So,
how far did they get?

34:56.553 --> 34:57.918
Pretty far.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.637
Time to finish
what they started.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.759
Give me a couple of hours,
and I'll let you know.

35:06.688 --> 35:07.894
(BUTTONS BEEPING)

35:08.982 --> 35:09.892
All right, baby.

35:10.025 --> 35:14.940
All you have to do
is neutralize a radioactive
water table, and we are good.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.871
The bomb's primed
and ready to go.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.241
It's hotwired into
the timing circuits down here.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.583
ALLISON: Great work, Zane.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.328
That wasn't me.
It was all Jimmy.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.797
It's set up so you can start
the countdown remotely.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.881
ALLISON: As soon
as you're clear.

35:38.678 --> 35:42.842
Okay. I just got one
more thing to do.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.440
We've evacuated the area
above the facility.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.155
You sure there's enough
lnstantanium left to
handle the nuclear blast?

36:01.284 --> 36:03.616
'Cause if it shatters,
all that force would go up,
not down.

36:03.745 --> 36:04.951
It'll never reach
the aquifer.

36:05.080 --> 36:05.865
But, it will reach us.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.488
Look, I told you.
I double-covered that area.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.661
Little firecracker won't
even make a dent.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.160
It's fascinating,
you know? You've created
a problem so big,

36:13.296 --> 36:15.628
the solution is to
detonate an atomic bomb.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.123
I know, right?
How cool is that?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.682
Should I come
with you guys?

36:30.021 --> 36:33.229
COMPUTER: Automated
countdown sequence initiated.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.933
Detonation in 10,

36:38.071 --> 36:41.108
nine, eight,

36:42.075 --> 36:44.942
seven, six,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.995
five, four,

36:50.083 --> 36:52.950
three, two,

36:54.129 --> 36:56.962
one, ZGFO.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.880
(EXPLODING)

37:01.928 --> 37:03.919
The sensor's into
the water table.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.137
It'll take a few seconds
to get the reading.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.348
And let us know
if we're all gonna die?

37:09.936 --> 37:11.301
Pretty much.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.269
Well, no matter
how it turns out...

37:13.398 --> 37:14.888
It's been a fun day.

37:15.692 --> 37:19.105
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it was.

37:19.863 --> 37:24.027
(SIGHING) Nice to
end the relationship
on a high note.

37:27.996 --> 37:28.951
(DEVICE BEEPING)

37:29.080 --> 37:30.945
So, what's the verdict?

37:31.499 --> 37:35.617
The explosion's completely
neutralized the baryogenic
radiation in the aquifer.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.164
Groundwater's safe.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.003
Well, good for us.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.796
I, uh, I should,
call Allison.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.917
Yeah.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.671
Hey! Um, after that call.

37:48.016 --> 37:52.635
(STUTTERING) If you, maybe
want to go for a, you know,
break-up dinner...

37:52.771 --> 37:53.760
(LAUGHS)

37:54.022 --> 37:55.182
No.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.435
How about a,
a make-up dinner, instead?

38:13.041 --> 38:15.202
Guess it's not so bad
being stuck together.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.324
(LAUGHS)

38:17.462 --> 38:18.827
Allison Blake, please?

38:30.642 --> 38:31.927
Hi.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.977
Hey, Jack.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.141
I'm really glad
I came to stay here.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.066
And I'm glad Uncle Jack
is gonna be around
for the boys.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.352
Me too.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.478
(LAUGHING)

38:46.616 --> 38:49.073
If you guys hug,
I know I'm dead.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.779
VVeH,hey,Lazy,
how you feeling?

38:53.998 --> 38:56.705
(LAUGHS) 17, I hope.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.794
LEXI: Well, we have
that Thorne lady
to thank for that.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.015
I came here thinking
I couldn't trust anyone.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.763
Boy, was I wrong.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.685
Uh, I wish I could
have done more.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.560
You made sure that nobody
would have to go through
what my brother went through.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.731
That's enough.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.820
And I still want to work
on a cure for you.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.736
It worked for Zoe.
That's what's important.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.453
And I can leave here
thinking about my future,
instead of my past.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.283
It's quite a gift.

39:36.416 --> 39:37.405
Where will you go?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.873
I'm quite a resourceful gal.

39:39.002 --> 39:39.957
(LAUGHS)

39:40.086 --> 39:43.169
Whoever I become next,
I'll be well taken care of.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.547
Goodbye, Henry.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.308
(BUS HONKING)

39:57.020 --> 39:59.261
Thank you for
giving me a new life.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.825
Are you sure that Mansfield
doesn't know that
we have the remains?

40:21.961 --> 40:24.668
I convinced him that
Thorne destroyed them
down in the bunker,

40:24.797 --> 40:26.708
along with most
of their research.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.253
And I promised Eva
that I would lay them
to rest.

40:29.385 --> 40:33.253
Hmm. You're laying
it all to rest.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.055
Henry, uh...

40:38.895 --> 40:41.102
I've been kind of afraid
to ask you this,

40:41.230 --> 40:42.811
butwas I...

40:42.941 --> 40:44.181
Exposed? No. Oh, no...

40:44.317 --> 40:45.853
(SIGHING) Oh.
Okay...

40:45.985 --> 40:46.815
The results came
back negative.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.355
Good. Ijust, um...

40:48.821 --> 40:50.732
(LAUGHS) I guess,
I just need some rest.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.197
Although, I did find
something else.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.536
So, party at
Pilar's tonight?

41:02.669 --> 41:04.330
You sure you're
feeling up to it?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.794
I'm feeling up to
a lot of things.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.924
Good thought to hold on to.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.181
I'm not gonna look.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.266
I'm, I'm not gonna look.

41:25.525 --> 41:26.685
Yeah.

41:26.818 --> 41:27.807
(LAUGHING)

41:28.903 --> 41:30.188
Shouldn't have looked.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.982
You're a good dad.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.946
Well, I don't know.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.818
Glad things are back
to normal. Or as
normal as they get.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.946
ALLISON: Getting excited
about being an uncle?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.868
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, I'm...

41:43.001 --> 41:45.788
(LAUGHING)
You know, I've never
really had boys around.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.911
Well, they'll need
a role model.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.333
True! I can finally
coach Little League.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.918
You'll be a great coach.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.257
Thanks.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.172
I was kind of hoping, um...

41:56.139 --> 41:57.595
You'd be mine.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.596
Okay. You gonna take up
T-ball or...

42:02.687 --> 42:06.020
No, my, uh,
my birthing coach.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.066
I'm pregnant.

42:12.572 --> 42:13.607
How?

42:13.740 --> 42:14.695
The usual way...

42:14.824 --> 42:16.906
Oh, I, I got the drill.
It...

42:18.077 --> 42:20.159
(SIGHING) Wow!
So, so it's...

42:20.288 --> 42:21.653
Nathan's.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.040
You okay?

42:24.042 --> 42:26.875
Yeah. Oh. General Mansfield.

42:27.003 --> 42:29.665
You sure don't make
my job easy, do you, Carter?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.587
Where's Thorne?

42:32.717 --> 42:33.877
General, I can explain.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.217
Dr. Blake, I have no evidence
that you've been
insubordinate.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.801
Don't give me any.

42:40.266 --> 42:44.885
Uh, sir, she's not so much
a fugitive as a victim,
in this...

42:45.021 --> 42:48.479
Yourjob is to
enforce the law,
not to make judgments.

42:48.608 --> 42:49.597
Yes, sir.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.065
You're a good man.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.983
But, you disobeyed a direct
order, and this time I can't
look the other way.

42:58.951 --> 43:01.738
Eureka no longer
requires your services.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.616
You are fired, Carter.
