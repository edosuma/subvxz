WEBVTT

00:17.476 --> 00:18.851
West!

00:21.647 --> 00:23.481
You bastard.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.194
You did this to me.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.741
But you'll not escape me.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.245
Not this time!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.578
Take this.
- It'll burst an artery.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.997
If we don't remove this now,
he's going to go into cardiac arrest.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.457
I assure you.
Be ready to clamp.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.668
If it doesn't hold...
- We have no choice, Dan.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.588
Now!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.259
Jesus Christ!

01:34.511 --> 01:35.636
It didn't hold!

01:41.977 --> 01:44.520
But his central nervous system
is still intact.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.649
He might still prove to be useful.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.194
More useful than he'd be otherwise.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.471
We have to retreat!

02:18.806 --> 02:20.807
The frontlines have weakened.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.534
God damnit, Herbert! What are you doing?
- You know very well what I'm doing, Dan.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.829
Don't you ever stop?
- We may never again have access

02:42.996 --> 02:46.833
to this volume of fresh subjects.
- Fascinating, there's somebody here.

02:50.546 --> 02:54.006
What do you want? Get away from those!
- What are you doing back here?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.217
Leave.
- Put that thing away!

02:56.552 --> 02:58.302
This is too dangerous for all of us.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.555
Where are you going?
We've got lots of work to do here.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.683
Come on!
Jesus Christ!

03:03.851 --> 03:04.892
She's right!
- She's wrong.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.061
No!
- Listen, we are close, Dan.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.605
Reticular consciousness
is not just in the brain.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.650
We know that, yes?
We've gone beyond that.

03:12.985 --> 03:13.985
Look at this.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.406
These reptiles are the key, Dan.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.949
Yes.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.451
You just still don't understand, do you?

03:22.619 --> 03:26.247
This is no longer
about just reanimating the dead.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.042
We will create new life.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.753
Hang on!

03:37.593 --> 03:39.135
Francesca?

03:40.846 --> 03:41.762
Get out of here!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.392
Come on! Let's go!

03:48.812 --> 03:50.229
Let's go.
- My notes.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.023
Leave them!
- Wait!

03:52.190 --> 03:54.692
Forget it!
- We'll need this back home.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.193
Come on!

04:03.118 --> 04:32.438
Dan?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.858
Well, you're going to be all right.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.280
We've got to get out.
Come on.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.699
Come on.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.409
Let's go home.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.212
Morning, Gloria.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.346
How's the star patient?

07:52.889 --> 07:53.931
Hello, Doctor.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.725
You look great.
I see you even put on some makeup.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.727
Don't tease me.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.105
It's just that...

08:02.691 --> 08:05.359
My head is about
the only part of me that's not sick.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.117
Excuse me.
- This is Dr. West.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.871
He'll be coordinating
with pathology about your biopsy.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.291
You're right.
That part of you is quite well.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.836
I'm scared.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.631
Don't worry.
The surgery is routine.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.426
I'll be taking
real good care of you.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.788
She's not an experiment.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.875
She's terminal.
- She's a patient!

09:03.043 --> 09:06.503
She could be of use to us, Dan.
- Not us. You.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.715
I'm a doctor.
- Who will be a scientist.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.326
Yes?

09:51.258 --> 09:54.134
Lieutenant Leslie Chapham,
Arkham Police Department.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.679
Leslie?
- Lieutenant.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.140
Well, how may I help you, Lieutenant?

10:00.725 --> 10:03.978
I understand that you are in charge of
the remains from the night of the massacre?

10:04.145 --> 10:08.107
Yes, but it's my understanding
that the case is closed.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.442
Not to me.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.916
It showed up in a carnival sideshow
just outside of Arkham.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.293
Dr. Hill?

10:29.087 --> 10:32.464
Remarkably well preserved, considering
the massacre was eight months ago.

10:32.799 --> 10:36.760
All the specimens from that night
exhibit the same qualities.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.723
Yes, as you see,
the skull is fractured right there.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.434
Didn't you know it was missing?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.060
You know,

10:46.229 --> 10:48.272
I could fix that.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.482
Where do you keep
the rest of the remains?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.950
The specimens from that night

11:00.285 --> 11:03.620
have shown almost
no signs of deterioration.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.540
This not only holds true
for the gross anatomy,

11:06.708 --> 11:08.834
but the individual cells
in each specimen

11:09.461 --> 11:12.671
display a lack of decay.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.342
Are you saying
that they're not quite dead?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.802
What's dead is dead, Lieutenant.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.930
I should know.
It's my field.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.272
What's this?

11:30.482 --> 11:33.317
That's something
Dr. Hill was working on.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.445
I haven't been able to identify it.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.946
Yet.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.991
I was planning on doing that
first thing in the morning, as a matter of fact.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.410
Is this all of it?

11:43.745 --> 11:47.081
Except for fragments and debris.
- What happened to that?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.167
Why, we burned them, of course.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.054
Suicide.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.223
Would-be ballet dancer
didn't have the stuff,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.351
cut off her feet and bled to death.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.687
Where are her feet?

12:11.481 --> 12:12.481
Her feet?

12:13.024 --> 12:15.067
Why... they're missing.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.530
A lot of stuff's been missing
from around here lately, Holmes.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
Body parts?

12:24.702 --> 12:28.580
Really, Lieutenant?
Who would want to steal body parts?

12:58.820 --> 12:59.820
Yes!

13:36.524 --> 13:38.484
How did you get back here?

13:46.784 --> 13:47.784
Well...

13:49.537 --> 13:51.538
well, well.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.423
What do you think of the location
of the will in the brain now, Dr. Hill?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.760
I'm sorry, what was that?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.848
Actually,
you've been quite useful to me.

14:10.016 --> 14:15.270
You helped me prove that consciousness
resides in every part of the body.

14:17.565 --> 14:24.988
You had such pretensions
of grandeur, you pompous plagiarist.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.824
But look at you now.

14:28.743 --> 14:32.663
You're nothing but a dead-head.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.753
A no-body.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.740
Did that police officer find you?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.578
Police?
- Yes, he came by while you were in surgery.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.252
You're gonna be all right.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.630
Gloria.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.836
Herbert!

16:36.204 --> 16:37.204
Herbert?

17:03.731 --> 17:04.940
Dan!

17:06.943 --> 17:08.026
Look at this!

17:08.194 --> 17:13.740
We practically share a wall with
the Avril's crypt in the cemetery.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.662
Yes, that's a 150 years of decay.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.539
Oh, well.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.790
Dust to dust.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.592
What happened to our cadaver?
- I was finished with it.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.761
Would you help me with this, please?

17:42.562 --> 17:43.562
Security.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.814
From what?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.828
Herbert, I've got something to tell you.
- Really?

17:59.996 --> 18:01.913
I have something to show you.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.028
Look at that, Dan.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.489
And no tissue damage.

18:36.616 --> 18:41.036
It simulates a heart attack.
And it leaves virtually no trace.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.127
That's real useful
if you want to murder someone.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.837
It is very useful...

18:52.173 --> 18:53.423
in obtaining...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.219
the freshest animal specimens.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.679
Right here.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.061
The amniotic fluid
of the Cuzco iguana.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.856
Did you know that this reptile
has not changed significantly in over...

19:10.024 --> 19:12.859
...a hundred million years.
Herbert, I know this is important.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.194
Now...

19:14.904 --> 19:19.366
we extract
the amniotic fluid from the sac.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.662
With that, we add the muscle proteins of

19:23.996 --> 19:25.914
myosin, actin and...

19:26.249 --> 19:27.415
Tropomyosin.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.168
Good.

19:31.546 --> 19:32.546
And then...

19:48.813 --> 19:50.230
Our reagent.

20:02.994 --> 20:06.037
Pure potentiality.

20:06.664 --> 20:10.667
The primordial ooze
from which life originates.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.466
Dr. Hill...

20:19.302 --> 20:21.261
Dr. Hill gave me this idea.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.161
I'm moving out.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.705
What?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.000
I'm moving out.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.502
Dan!

20:55.463 --> 20:57.172
You can't turn back now.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.008
This...

21:00.176 --> 21:03.136
This is the key to creating life!

21:03.304 --> 21:07.098
Parts! Reanimated parts!
- We're trying to save whole people, not parts.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.977
Exactly, and what are people, Dan,
over and above a collection of living parts?

21:13.022 --> 21:15.273
We can create...

21:16.442 --> 21:18.234
new life.

21:35.169 --> 21:39.589
This morbid doodling
with human body parts.

21:42.551 --> 21:46.596
Is this what it's all about?
Is this what all our great work has led to?

21:46.764 --> 21:48.556
Exactly what are you insinuating?
- This is your madness!

21:48.724 --> 21:50.517
It had nothing to do with me.
I'm out!

21:50.685 --> 21:54.354
I didn't see you rejecting my work
when Meg was lying there dead!

21:54.522 --> 21:57.315
Where were your great ideals then?
- Don't you...

22:06.659 --> 22:07.659
Daniel?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.913
What was it about Meg that you loved?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.186
Meg's heart.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.078
Help me...

22:53.080 --> 22:54.873
to continue the work.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.898
We can create a new life.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.904
Starting...

23:30.076 --> 23:31.326
with Meg's heart.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Yes.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.630
Now, Dan.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.550
You're going to have to help.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.345
At the hospital.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.431
What about the police?

23:54.391 --> 23:56.935
No, the police will never come here.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.760
Daniel Cain?
- Yes.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.643
Police?

24:50.239 --> 24:51.447
Come on in.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.121
Is there a problem?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.130
Who are you?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.552
Dr. West.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.347
Lieutenant Chapham.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.515
Police.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.226
What do you want?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.937
It's...

25:24.481 --> 25:26.566
quite an old place you got here.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.234
It used to be a mortuary.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.362
After the cemetery filled up,
it was the caretaker's house.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.032
Nobody's been here for twenty years.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.203
Odd place to live.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.622
Has its advantages.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.296
Pretty morbid stuff.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.882
I don't consider science morbid.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.302
It was pretty morbid
the night Dr. Carl Hill died.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.596
And Dean... Dean...

26:00.726 --> 26:03.811
Halsey.
- Dean Halsey. Yeah.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.065
And Megan Halsey.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.904
Do you mind if I sit down?

26:17.117 --> 26:21.246
Dr. West, what kind of problems
did you have with Dr. Carl Hill?

26:21.580 --> 26:24.874
Dr. Hill and I
had professional differences.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.961
It was nothing personal.
I have been all through this.

26:28.295 --> 26:32.215
It's in the police records,
which I am certain you have access to.

26:32.383 --> 26:36.803
I understand
that you have some radical ideas about...

26:37.388 --> 26:39.973
the reanimation of dead tissue?

26:41.183 --> 26:45.103
When I was in medical school,
I might have had time to discuss the theory.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.479
I don't anymore.

26:46.647 --> 26:50.316
I suppose those poor souls
out at the Sefton Ward...

26:51.193 --> 26:52.193
are theory.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.993
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:07.876 --> 27:12.714
And I suppose you don't know anything
about the missing body parts at the hospital?

27:14.425 --> 27:16.384
Missing body parts?

27:19.263 --> 27:20.263
No.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.312
I can find my own way out.

29:14.753 --> 29:20.049
Get off!

29:20.592 --> 29:21.592
Get off me!

29:23.512 --> 29:24.512
Get off!

29:53.250 --> 29:54.709
Ernest?

29:54.877 --> 29:57.712
Dr. Graves
wants to see you right away.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.506
Pathology?
- Right away.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.180
What about the...
- I'll take care of it.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.765
Cool.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.814
More.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
Dr. Hill...

31:02.778 --> 31:03.903
Is that you?

31:04.238 --> 31:06.489
More!

31:21.380 --> 31:24.590
Dr. Graves.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.760
You... you see?

31:28.387 --> 31:31.389
I recognize you.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.599
You do?

31:33.934 --> 31:37.812
That seminar in Zurich...

31:38.146 --> 31:39.313
Yes.

31:39.481 --> 31:46.070
Your theory of reconciling creationism...

31:46.405 --> 31:50.575
with the origin of disease...

31:51.577 --> 31:52.577
Yes.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.246
Totally idiotic!

32:15.559 --> 32:16.809
It's you, come in!

32:22.524 --> 32:23.608
No, no.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.775
No lights.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.570
Come over here.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.125
Dr. Hill?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.460
Speak to me.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.634
Speak to me, Dr. Hill!

32:50.510 --> 32:51.969
Speak.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.182
This is some kind of joke, right, man?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.684
No, it is not a joke.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.144
He can talk.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.313
He heard my lecture in Zurich.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.107
The head?
He heard your lecture?

33:05.275 --> 33:07.652
He can talk, for God's sake!

33:08.612 --> 33:09.612
Listen.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.698
Talk, damnit! Talk!

33:13.533 --> 33:15.159
Talk!
- The head...

33:26.213 --> 33:30.007
Don't you ever do that again,
you mental midget!

33:30.926 --> 33:33.761
Oh my God.
My God, I'm losing my mind.

33:34.846 --> 33:39.016
I have some unfinished business.

33:39.351 --> 33:44.980
And you will assist me.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.694
Not out the front door.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.531
Just the doctor
taking a patient out for a little air.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.335
Man!
- Oh my God!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.045
Herbert!

34:25.563 --> 34:26.563
Hey, pooch.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.319
Yes! You said "Hi" to him!

34:32.654 --> 34:33.654
Francesca!

34:43.039 --> 34:44.206
Hi, Doctor.
- Hi.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.710
Don't let the little head
rule the big head, Dan.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.842
So, what are you doing in Arkham?

34:56.511 --> 34:59.346
Oh, I'm doing some
interviews in Boston this week.

34:59.514 --> 35:03.100
Dr. Cain, 5436.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.811
Oh God. I've gotta go.
- I know.

35:05.979 --> 35:06.979
Listen...

35:07.773 --> 35:09.607
What about dinner tonight?

35:10.150 --> 35:11.984
Only if you let me cook.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.737
Real Italian style.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.740
Okay.
Only if you'll let me help.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.493
Real American style.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.829
It's a deal.
- See you tonight.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.623
Yeah.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.500
Hope you like garlic!

35:34.674 --> 35:35.841
Well, Angel?

35:36.176 --> 35:39.845
What do you think?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.556
Hey, pooch.
Where did you come from?

35:43.809 --> 35:44.809
From Peru.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.187
Is that where you met Dr. Cain?

35:51.191 --> 35:53.609
Why do you want to know, Mr...

35:56.154 --> 35:57.154
Lee Chapham.

35:59.241 --> 36:00.241
Arkham Police.

36:02.953 --> 36:03.953
Lieutenant.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.416
I'd like to talk to you about him.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.965
Did you ever hear of the "Miskatonic Massacre"?
- No, I haven't.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.509
It happened here at the hospital.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.472
Eight months ago the department
got a call about a homicide

36:23.640 --> 36:26.475
at the Miskatonic University hospital.

36:26.643 --> 36:29.687
The whole place was in a panic.
It was down in the morgue.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.356
There was blood all over the walls.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.775
You ever been around dead bodies?

36:38.613 --> 36:42.074
Then you know that stench
of decaying flesh.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.745
Out of the darkness
we were attacked by a naked maniac.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.915
He jumped right on my partner
and bit his arm.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.750
Nothing could make him come loose.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.711
Tore the muscle right off the bone

36:53.879 --> 36:56.213
before we pumped enough lead in him
to make him stop.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.223
The dean of the medical school
was down there.

37:06.975 --> 37:07.975
In pieces.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.984
Also a prominent physician,
Dr. Carl Hill.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.822
We found only his head.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.868
The rest of his body
was just part of the muck.

37:28.622 --> 37:29.997
Funny thing though:

37:32.584 --> 37:35.252
His head,
when I found it, was still...

37:36.630 --> 37:37.630
twitching.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.214
Twitching?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.425
The doctors had a lot of
highfalutin explanations.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.802
Postmortem involuntary spasm...

37:43.970 --> 37:44.970
I don't know.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.975
But I've seen my share of the dead.

37:52.187 --> 37:55.522
And I never saw
a twitching like that before.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.902
They blamed it all
on these ones in here.

38:00.070 --> 38:01.487
The funny thing is:

38:02.155 --> 38:04.823
There's a death certificate
at the hospital for each one of these.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.200
A death certificate?

38:06.368 --> 38:10.454
I mean to say these three didn't get
to the morgue on their own two feet.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.290
The hospital made a mistake?

38:19.047 --> 38:22.299
The hospital might have made
a mistake about those two.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.180
Not...

38:29.057 --> 38:30.265
But not this one.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.936
I know about this one.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.189
She was my wife.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.401
I'm sorry.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.029
Elizabeth, stop!

38:44.364 --> 38:46.949
Get off me!

38:56.918 --> 38:59.920
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right. Thanks.

39:03.883 --> 39:04.883
That's enough.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.678
She's never done
anything like that before.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.846
Just...

39:09.639 --> 39:12.057
What does all this
have to do with Daniel?

39:12.225 --> 39:16.186
Dr. Cain and Dr. West were
the only normal survivors of that night.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.523
Daniel's girlfriend was Meg Halsey,
the dean's daughter.

39:20.066 --> 39:24.111
And Daniel was found
with her dead body in his arms.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.780
Her dead body.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.782
Twitching.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.493
Like that blasted head.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.933
Not too much,
we don't want premature reanimation.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.561
Thank you,
I've never done this before.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.366
Yes.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.128
Good.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.472
The circulation is going to work.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.018
God damnit, Herbert!

40:42.649 --> 40:44.066
What are we doing here anyway?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.985
Why don't we just publish our findings?
We could get grant money.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.488
Because they would
never understand our methods.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.366
Besides that,
they would steal the work.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.494
It's never gonna work.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.872
She's gonna be uncontrollably spastic.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.875
Unless we reanimate all the limbs
at the same time, they'll separate.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.129
That's why we inject
directly into the heart.

41:05.296 --> 41:08.132
The circulatory system
should distribute the reagent

41:08.299 --> 41:12.136
to all the various limbs
and effect reanimation concurrently.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.180
We've never done that before.
- I know that.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.392
No, I don't want to gamble
with Meg's heart.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.289
Oh God...

41:42.417 --> 41:44.334
Ciao, dottore. Come va?
- Francesca...

41:48.006 --> 41:51.300
Sorry about the place.
I didn't have any time to...

41:51.467 --> 41:54.344
Did I come too early?
- No! No, no, no, no.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.763
God, you look great.

42:00.727 --> 42:04.104
Open this up, will you?
It's a Chianti, 1987.

42:06.274 --> 42:09.526
So, where is the kitchen?
- It's right over here.

42:10.862 --> 42:15.741
Did you have any trouble finding it?
- Oh, no. The cemetery made it real easy.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.009
This is my special sauce.

42:34.886 --> 42:35.886
Here.

42:41.267 --> 42:44.269
What do you think? You like it?
- I love it.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.521
So do I.

45:18.883 --> 45:19.883
Come on.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.380
You're so beautiful.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.970
Your skin's so soft.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.308
So warm.

46:42.758 --> 46:44.843
What are you doing here?

46:51.559 --> 46:53.185
What do you want?

46:55.813 --> 46:57.981
The body you took
from the crematorium.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.150
Get out of here.
Right now.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.363
What's down here?

47:07.408 --> 47:09.409
That's none of your business.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.269
You are making a big mistake.

47:37.939 --> 47:39.231
Do you believe...

47:39.982 --> 47:41.775
that dead is dead,

47:42.735 --> 47:43.860
Dr. West?

47:45.071 --> 47:49.908
I don't know what you're talking about.
- I am talking about my wife!

47:51.827 --> 47:54.204
No! You can't go in there.

47:54.372 --> 47:55.830
Move.
- No.

47:56.499 --> 47:57.916
Move!

48:47.425 --> 48:48.425
You...

48:50.386 --> 48:51.511
butcher!

48:51.846 --> 48:54.306
How dare you judge my work?

48:55.099 --> 48:56.391
"Work"?

48:58.644 --> 49:01.021
Was my wife your "work"?

49:01.355 --> 49:03.732
Don't lay your guilt on me, Lieutenant!
- What?

49:03.899 --> 49:06.526
Your wife died
of multiple contusions to the head.

49:06.694 --> 49:08.236
From a blunt instrument.
- No.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.697
Multiple blows to the head!
- She fell!

49:10.865 --> 49:12.157
She fell, did she?

49:13.159 --> 49:16.411
That was not my fault!

49:35.056 --> 49:36.056
What happened?

49:36.932 --> 49:38.058
He attacked me.

49:38.768 --> 49:42.020
No, Dan! Dan!
I can't help it if his heart gave out!

49:42.188 --> 49:43.855
God, Herbert, he's a cop!

49:45.483 --> 49:46.483
You...

49:49.570 --> 49:51.237
What are we gonna do with him?

49:52.406 --> 49:53.406
Well...

49:54.659 --> 49:57.410
We could get him
back out on the street.

49:57.870 --> 49:58.870
Walking.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.003
You don't wanna gamble
with Meg's heart.

50:07.171 --> 50:10.757
This is our opportunity for a test.
Do you wanna waste it?

50:17.640 --> 50:20.016
How much do you think he weighs?
230, 240?

50:26.148 --> 50:28.650
So little tissue damage.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.194
Oh, Dan?

50:34.156 --> 50:35.782
Just in case.

50:46.502 --> 50:47.502
Daniel?

50:55.219 --> 50:56.219
It's working.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.520
Get away from me with that cloth!

51:09.108 --> 51:10.442
No! Dan!

51:16.657 --> 51:19.492
He's a wife-beater, Dan!
Use the gun!

52:10.503 --> 52:11.211
Dan?

52:11.545 --> 52:12.504
Herbert?

52:35.736 --> 52:37.028
Lieutenant Chapham!

52:37.738 --> 52:39.239
What are you doing here?

52:43.244 --> 52:44.994
Herbert!

52:54.547 --> 52:57.423
No! Stop!

53:02.304 --> 53:03.304
Stop!

53:03.806 --> 53:05.098
Get away from me!

53:05.432 --> 53:06.432
Get out!

53:06.934 --> 53:08.268
Get away...

53:42.177 --> 53:43.177
What happened?

53:52.187 --> 53:53.187
Is he gone?

53:54.356 --> 53:56.733
What is going on here?

54:01.238 --> 54:03.907
What did you do to him
to make him that way?

54:04.783 --> 54:05.909
She's hysterical.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.788
What did you do to him? Why?

55:51.890 --> 55:53.808
What are you doing down here?

55:54.810 --> 55:57.854
Your welcome does not extend
to this part of the house.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.274
Angel?

56:03.318 --> 56:04.318
Sweetie.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.081
Get out of my way!

56:17.416 --> 56:20.501
You should never have brought her here.
- Get that thing out of here!

56:20.836 --> 56:22.170
Francesca, wait!
Let me explain.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.464
Is this what you did to Meg?

56:25.090 --> 56:26.257
You're a freak!

56:27.551 --> 56:29.010
God, I hate you!

56:34.850 --> 56:36.934
You're better off without her.

56:56.330 --> 56:57.330
Dan.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.123
Now listen to me.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.461
All we need is just one last piece.

57:06.215 --> 57:07.215
Dan?

57:10.886 --> 57:11.886
Gloria?

57:12.679 --> 57:13.679
Hi.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.313
How are you feeling today?

57:32.366 --> 57:33.366
You see,

57:34.576 --> 57:37.745
it helps me to think of you as Meg.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.542
Meg who lived.

58:00.686 --> 58:01.394
Nurse!

58:03.981 --> 58:05.356
Paddles!

58:09.278 --> 58:12.738
I didn't even notice.
God, what's wrong with me?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.448
Let me through!

58:16.493 --> 58:17.493
Give me that!

58:18.412 --> 58:19.412
Clear!

58:20.747 --> 58:21.873
Push the lidocaine!

58:25.419 --> 58:26.419
Clear!

58:28.547 --> 58:29.589
Forget it, Dan.

58:30.090 --> 58:31.090
Let's go in.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.646
She's never gonna survive this.
- She's already dead, Dan.

58:45.814 --> 58:47.815
No, you're off midline.

58:47.983 --> 58:48.983
Damnit!

58:57.451 --> 58:58.784
I'm getting nothing.

58:58.952 --> 58:59.952
I'm sorry.

59:00.287 --> 59:01.287
Come on!

59:03.498 --> 59:05.374
Anything?
- Still flat.

59:07.461 --> 59:08.502
I'm calling it.

59:08.837 --> 59:10.296
No!

59:14.218 --> 59:15.218
Not again.

59:31.652 --> 59:39.617
Go home.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:00.846
Yes.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.266
Come to room 613.
Right away.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:42.346
Damn you, West!

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:45.933
Wilbur!

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.269
Get me out of here!
- No.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.313
West took my body,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.606
but he cannot take my mind.

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.650
Take me to him!

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.069
No.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.946
Just don't talk.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.198
Don't say anything.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:14.086
Don't make me get someone else.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.947
What do you think you're doing?

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:43.282
Stop!

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.244
Do as I say, you nincompoop!

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.584
Come on, come on.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.505
You're going away now.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.681
Now, now...

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.775
Yo, Dr. West.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.777
Let's get this.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.365
No, no.
You get the feet.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:27.368
I'll get the head.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.502
Was she good-looking, Doc?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.273
You take this to the crematorium.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.859
The crematorium?
You mean pathology.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.402
I mean crematorium.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.577
Well, excuse me!

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.874
Excuse me, have you seen Dr. Cain?

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.084
He left.

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:18.669
For the day, I think.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.796
Is there something wrong?

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.548
He's very upset.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.508
He lost a patient.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:28.012
I've never known a doctor
that cared so much.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:31.599
Yeah.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:41.484
Now, Dan, I'm going to
need your help with this.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.651
Understand?

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.532
This is for you, too.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.912
Gloria! No...

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.789
Dan, don't quit on me now, please.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.959
It's going to take the two of us
to fuse the brain to the spinal cord.

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.961
No!
- Dan, look!

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.089
Look what we've done.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.009
Meg's heart is going to beat again.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:11.263
Others dare not dream
what we are about to do.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:13.974
Dan.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.940
The feet...

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.234
of a young ballet dancer...

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:27.321
who ended her life
when she lost her ambition.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:30.824
These legs...

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:33.827
walked the streets.

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:38.749
You remember the hooker who was killed
in the E.R. by her pimp last week?

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.336
Think of all the bodies
these legs have wrapped around.

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.630
What was the value of her life?

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.758
To end up being picked apart
by the likes of Dr. Graves

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.343
and his bumbling students?

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.096
And here,

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.057
the womb of the virgin.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.727
Struck down
before tasting the pleasures of life.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.480
Remember?

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.149
Her skin.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.610
So soft.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.572
So warm.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:14.451
But so cold in death.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:20.374
The arms of a waitress.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:25.504
The lawyer's hand.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:28.966
Case dismissed.

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:37.600
And look at this delicate piece.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.686
What do you think?

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.606
A sculptress?

01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:46.317
A harpist?

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.070
Would you believe...

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.948
a murderess?

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:01.081
But they're all equal now.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:06.003
Nothing but cast-off remnants
of a meaningless existence.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.508
Even her.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.721
How beautiful is this face?

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:19.183
Oh, yes.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:21.894
She...

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:24.980
was special.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:27.691
Yes.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.736
Just...

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.237
dead...

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:33.947
tissue.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:37.618
But in our hands...

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.538
it's the clay of life.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.125
Within this chest,

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.879
Meg's heart will beat again.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:03.102
Good.

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:06.939
Let's get to work.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:23.664
Who's there?

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:00.367
I didn't do anything.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:04.663
Oh, no.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.333
You disappoint me,

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.586
Dr. Graves.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.046
Please.

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:15.466
On the table!

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.429
No!
- Yes!

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
Scalpel.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:57.424
Left!

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:14.733
Get off me!
Let me go! Get off me!

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.444
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.573
No! Let me go!

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.158
No!

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.870
Cain, West.

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:29.915
They did this to me!
- Let the fuck go!

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.251
And they'll pay!

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.754
Please, let me out!

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.631
Let me out, please!

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.300
Please let me out! Please!

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.596
Oh my God!
- Get security!

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:20.507
Well...

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:24.011
If it had always been
as fresh as the head, but...

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.099
I think we're ready, Dan.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.434
Good.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.698
Sounds like rats in the wall.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:46.742
Rats?

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:49.453
Yes.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:51.747
That's what it is.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.627
The little buggers
better stay put or I'll...

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.511
We start with the heart.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.237
And God created woman.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:32.663
Let me.

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:20.419
Time?

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.463
Time?
- 15 seconds.

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:39.354
45 seconds.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.997
Three minutes, 15 seconds.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.875
It's going to take time.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:05.589
Damnit!

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.258
Not now.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:44.307
Breathe.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.065
Yes.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:17:01.074
Breathe.

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:03.451
Stay with me.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:08.623
Yes.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.602
You're alive.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.036
Alive...

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.133
Herbert!

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.673
I made you.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.177
Daniel!

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:50.345
She's alive.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:52.180
They're coming!

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.015
Now!

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.061
Dan! Get her out of here!

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:00.980
Freeze! Police!

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.191
What?

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:06.653
Francesca, go!

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.165
Dan, help me!

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.775
No! This!

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:54.617
Get this!

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:00.665
Yes.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:31.821
Who is she?

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.241
It's Meg.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.119
Meg is dead.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.501
Dan!

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.300
My God, they're using tools!

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.283
What have you done in here?

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:19.827
We created a life.

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.164
You made her?
- Yes.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.501
Dead pieces of this.
With my hands I created

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:30.254
what no man's mind or woman's womb
could ever hope to achieve.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.757
This is blasphemy!

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:36.761
Blasphemy?
Before what God?

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:42.475
A God repulsed by the miserable humanity
he created in his own image?

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:46.729
I will not be shackled
by the failures of your God.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:51.401
The only blasphemy
is to wallow in insignificance.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:56.197
I have taken refuse
of your God's failures

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:58.616
and I have triumphed.

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:01.119
There!

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:04.539
There is my creation!

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.459
He made me.

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:15.967
Open up! Open!

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.469
Dan?

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.805
We've got to fight them off.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:23.683
Leave him alone!

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:25.643
Listen to me!

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.260
Your girlfriend
doesn't stand a chance.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.472
Our girl is superior.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.109
Help!

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.696
Leave her alone, you monster!

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:25.203
Forget it, Dan.
She's just an assembly of dead tissue.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:38.800
You made me.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.802
I made you!

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.848
Don't! Dan, wait!

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.249
Don't you want me?

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:16.337
I don't want your body!

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.015
Then what do you want?

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:58.421
Is this what you want?

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.047
You're not...

01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:01.883
Meg.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:04.010
Meg's dead.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.641
No!

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:21.986
Out of the way!

01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:24.405
You're next, you little squirt!

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.313
Make a note of it, Dan!

01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:02.818
"Tissue rejection!"

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.620
My wife understands, really.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.637
Francesca!

01:28:36.103 --> 01:28:37.103
West!

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:41.065
You stupid biped!

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:47.905
No.

01:28:50.701 --> 01:28:51.701
Get back!

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:53.744
How dare you!

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.418
You're under arrest!

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.344
Get off!
Get off of me!

01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:15.433
No!

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.105
Oh my God, Dan.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:59.935
Are we having fun, yet?

01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:22.458
Get off of me, you rejects!

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:34.386
It's over, West!
