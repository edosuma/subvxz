00:05.353 --> 00:08.791
Tonight,
global business tycoon
Peter Jones joins the Tank.

00:08.834 --> 00:12.012
Peter is the most seasoned
investor on "Dragons' Den,"

00:12.055 --> 00:13.665
the U.K. version
of "Shark Tank,"

00:13.709 --> 00:15.667
with 18 seasons under his belt.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.278
I can help
you scale this business

00:17.321 --> 00:18.757
from a global perspective.

00:18.801 --> 00:19.976
That's what I bring
to the party.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.544
The British are coming!

00:22.587 --> 00:24.633
Ocean plastics are one of
the biggest

00:24.676 --> 00:26.983
environmental challenges
of our generation.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.332
We have got
the meals for busy people

00:28.376 --> 00:30.334
who care about
what they put in their bodies.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.075
It's a perfect tool
when you're multitasking

00:32.119 --> 00:33.424
or when you have a coworker
like Mr. Wonderful

00:33.468 --> 00:34.599
who keeps on ranting.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
This is
a lifelong dream realized,

00:38.125 --> 00:40.518
to be able to put my passion
for music into my career.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.824
I could be your perfect partner,

00:41.867 --> 00:43.391
and that's why I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.001
I know how to make
this thing huge.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.655
I'm afraid you guys
might hold me back.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.048
Who's ready
to take the bait?

00:48.091 --> 00:50.354
- It's a no-brainer.
- It's time
to make some money.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.060
First in the Tank

01:00.103 --> 01:02.758
is a way to give
the most memorable gift.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.550
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Ellen Hodges.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.030
And I'm Omayya Atout,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.120
and we're seeking $400,000
in exchange for 10% equity

01:17.164 --> 01:18.252
in Songlorious.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.819
Do you want to give a gift
that you know

01:20.863 --> 01:22.386
will get
a strong emotional reaction,

01:22.430 --> 01:27.087
a gift that captures memories,
a gift that creates new ones?

01:27.130 --> 01:29.089
Greeting cards, flowers,
they all fall flat

01:29.132 --> 01:30.612
'cause they're
kind of impersonal

01:30.655 --> 01:32.962
and, sooner or later,
and up in the trash.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.531
That's where
Songlorious comes in,

01:36.574 --> 01:39.142
with a gift
that lasts forever.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.492
Songlorious is a website
that anyone can use

01:41.536 --> 01:43.799
to have a personalized,
studio-quality song

01:43.842 --> 01:46.584
made completely from scratch
for any occasion.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.151
All you have to do
is go to the website,

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
choose a genre,
tell us your story,

01:50.197 --> 01:51.676
and one of our artists
will have a song created

01:51.720 --> 01:52.721
especially for
your loved one.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.157
Let us give you
a little taste

01:54.201 --> 01:55.985
of what you could expect
from Songlorious.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.294
- - Yeah!
- - Very good.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.643
Yay!

02:45.687 --> 02:47.297
- Alright.
- Good job.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.473
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to rock...

02:49.517 --> 02:50.822
And roll with us...

02:50.866 --> 02:52.389
Into the future
of gift giving?!

02:53.869 --> 02:54.913
- - Alright.
- - Good job.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.350
How does it work?

02:56.393 --> 02:58.787
So, every song is completely
unique and made per order.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.093
So, you go to the website,
you choose a genre,

03:01.137 --> 03:02.747
you tell us how long
you want the song to be.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.054
We've got options from
30 seconds to three minutes.

03:05.097 --> 03:08.231
And, you know, the price depends
on those two factors.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.667
And then you just
tell us your story.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.017
You tell us the occasion
and about the person it's for.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.237
Part of the order process,
you choose the genre,

03:14.281 --> 03:16.021
And some of them
are acoustic genres,

03:16.065 --> 03:17.153
which are priced
a little cheaper,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.328
and some of them
are full production.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.852
We've got pop-rock,
country-rock, EDM.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.245
And then
it's up to the artists

03:22.289 --> 03:23.855
to provide
all of the instrumentation.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.509
What's the price between
a 30-second

03:25.553 --> 03:26.902
versus a three-minute?

03:26.945 --> 03:28.991
So, a 30-second is $45.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.515
That's what it starts at
for an acoustic song

03:31.559 --> 03:33.561
And for a full
three-minute song,

03:33.604 --> 03:36.303
if it's acoustic, $205.

03:36.346 --> 03:40.524
And if it's a full
instrumentation, it's $230.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.786
So, how does it work, then?

03:41.830 --> 03:43.614
So you've got a load
of freelance singers?

03:43.658 --> 03:44.963
Yes.
Yes.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.096
We have about 100 musicians
on our team right now.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.185
And how much do you pay them
each time they do a song?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.709
So we pay them anywhere
between 35% to 55%

03:51.753 --> 03:53.189
of the song's order cost,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.844
plus any tips that they get,
they get 100% of.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.238
And the average tip
is about $51.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.717
- Wow.
- Good for them.
That's awesome.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.067
What have your sales been so far
since you've launched?

04:02.111 --> 04:05.201
So last year
we made $700,000.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.637
- Oh!
- Wow.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.639
This year to date,
we've made $1.1 million.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.032
Wow.
That's so great.
Whoa!

04:10.075 --> 04:11.120
O'You made $1.1 million.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.600
What do you get
to the bottom line

04:12.643 --> 04:13.688
by the time bottom line
by the time...?

04:13.731 --> 04:15.255
The bottom line
is 9% profit so far.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.474
- 9%?
- And that's after you guys
pay yourselves, obviously.

04:17.518 --> 04:18.823
No, that's before
we pay ourselves.

04:18.867 --> 04:19.607
Ohh.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.043
Well,
when we started,

04:21.086 --> 04:22.392
we were living
in Brooklyn

04:22.436 --> 04:24.307
in an apartment
with four other roommates,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.353
and I just basically used
my personal credit cards

04:26.396 --> 04:28.050
to start the website.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.270
And basically
any money we were making,

04:30.313 --> 04:31.314
we were putting back in.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.707
How did you come
up with this idea?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.535
So, we're both musicians.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.145
We made
a personalized song

04:36.188 --> 04:38.060
for one of my friends
for their wedding

04:38.103 --> 04:39.888
right before
the pandemic hit,

04:39.931 --> 04:42.934
and then we decided to kind of
turn that idea into a website

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
and make the songs ourself.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.807
We hoped to do
about three songs a week

04:45.850 --> 04:47.765
just for fun
and some extra money.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.898
And then put some
advertising money behind it

04:49.941 --> 04:51.856
because we believed
in the idea.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.771
But then we started getting more
orders than we could handle.

04:53.815 --> 04:57.122
We were staying up all night
in our apartment, making music.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
- Writing music, too.
- And we were overwhelmed.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.604
And that's
at the same time

05:00.648 --> 05:02.389
artists were contacting us,
like,

05:02.432 --> 05:04.826
"Hey, we saw your ad.
I'm looking for work."

05:04.869 --> 05:07.045
And we were like, "Join the team
'cause we need people."

05:07.089 --> 05:09.047
This is a lifelong dream
realized, to be able

05:09.091 --> 05:11.746
to put my passion
for music into my career.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.356
It's the best feeling
in the world.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.140
And to do it with, you know,
the love of my life.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.577
Now, who has knocked you off
so far?

05:16.620 --> 05:17.969
How many competitors
do you have?

05:18.013 --> 05:19.623
So, there are other businesses
that do this.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.451
You know, personalized
songs have really been around

05:21.495 --> 05:23.018
since the singing telegram.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.890
It's not -- it seems new,
but it's very old.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.545
There are some websites out
there that are just one person.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.461
They typically have
long turnaround times
and high prices.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.507
And then the other ones
that have a roster of musicians

05:33.550 --> 05:35.204
are typically
templated songs

05:35.247 --> 05:37.249
where they just change a name,
and, you know...

05:37.293 --> 05:39.556
Is it just the two of you
running the company?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.818
It started
just the two of us.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.646
Now we have four
full-time employees.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.692
So, where do you see
this company going?

05:44.735 --> 05:47.564
We can copy and paste
this model into other languages.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.305
Right now we only do songs
in English.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.568
We really want to dive into
the wedding sector as well.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.570
We do a lot of songs
for weddings already,

05:53.614 --> 05:55.964
but we feel like there's
a lot of opportunity there.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.269
Wedding sector.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.881
And then additionally,
with the corporate world,

05:59.924 --> 06:01.839
you know, we already
have a couple of companies

06:01.883 --> 06:03.188
who are ordering songs
all the time.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.842
Anytime somebody
gets promoted or hired,

06:04.886 --> 06:06.148
they buy them a custom song.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.758
What would you like
to use the money for?

06:07.802 --> 06:10.848
We're going to use it
for all the marketing expansions

06:10.892 --> 06:12.676
that we're looking for,
whether it's digital, you know,

06:12.720 --> 06:14.286
television, radio, et cetera.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.158
The truth is, you know,
we're musicians,

06:16.201 --> 06:17.768
we're not
marketing experts.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.509
We've come this far,
but we really need --

06:19.553 --> 06:20.945
You want to use
the $400,000

06:20.989 --> 06:22.425
to professionalize
the whole operation, basically.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.557
Exactly.
Exactly.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.472
I get the feeling
and sense that

06:25.515 --> 06:26.647
you're not businesspeople.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.083
That's why you're here.
You need help.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.693
Kevin.
Do you like this?

06:30.781 --> 06:32.130
- So do I.
- But do you have a forecast?

06:32.174 --> 06:34.350
Do you have any idea
of where this could get to?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.439
We have a general idea
from just forecasting

06:36.483 --> 06:37.658
regular numbers-wise.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.703
We're looking at
$2.5 million this year,

06:39.747 --> 06:41.401
and we're looking out
for about

06:41.444 --> 06:42.576
$5 million next year.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.534
So, in the U.K.,
I used to own a company

06:44.578 --> 06:45.709
called Red Letter Days.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.494
Basically, it was
an experience company.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.974
You could buy a recording
for whatever you wanted,

06:50.018 --> 06:51.411
for a birthday,
for whatever.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.629
Very, very similar.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.762
We sold it,
and we made a lot of money.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.373
One thing that was really
interesting is it took off.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.548
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.332
It was really, really big.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.725
But it took off
because we decided

07:01.769 --> 07:03.205
to make it really simple.

07:03.248 --> 07:03.814
Mm-hmm.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.120
And your website

07:05.163 --> 07:06.861
and your technology
you're using

07:06.904 --> 07:08.993
is absolutely vital
to get that right.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.475
But I do think, with the right
backup in terms of technology,

07:12.519 --> 07:15.478
I think this could be huge,
particularly for weddings.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
That means so much
- to hear it from you.
- Thank you.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.568
Guys, with what's happening

07:18.612 --> 07:21.484
in artificial intelligence,
you've seen, you know,

07:21.528 --> 07:24.269
emulated voices that sound
really, really, really good.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.314
Mm-hmm.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.968
I have a company
called Synthesia,

07:27.011 --> 07:28.752
and that's all they do
is replicate voices.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.102
- Wow.
- So you can take my voice

07:31.146 --> 07:33.496
saying this and convert it
to 30 different languages.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.889
Ellen, Omayya,

07:34.932 --> 07:36.543
based on this experience
that I have

07:36.586 --> 07:38.066
in growing businesses like this,

07:38.109 --> 07:40.068
I could be
your perfect partner.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.504
And that's why I'm gonna
make you an offer.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.897
- Okay.
- Oh!

07:42.940 --> 07:45.769
But my offer
doesn't come cheap.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.424
I'm going to
offer you $400,000,

07:48.468 --> 07:51.166
but I'd like to share
the business with you equally,

07:51.209 --> 07:52.950
I'd like a third
of the business.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.517
- Oh!
- We appreciate the offer
very much.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.649
Yeah.
Thank you.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.999
This type of business
could be huge.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.044
I can help you scale
this business

08:00.088 --> 08:01.872
from a global perspective,
and I think that's

08:01.916 --> 08:03.831
really important
for a business like this.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.311
Absolutely.
The global market is definitely
something we're interested in.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.358
I think Peter has a great offer
on the table.

08:09.401 --> 08:13.710
That's why I'll match that,
but for 20%.

08:13.754 --> 08:14.755
Wow.
Appreciate the offer.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.116
All sharks are still in.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.727
Ellen and Omayya have two offers
on the table

08:30.771 --> 08:33.556
for their custom song business,
Songlorious.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.776
But Mark and Kevin
may also be interested.

08:35.819 --> 08:38.561
I'm huge in the wedding
industry, obviously,

08:38.605 --> 08:41.999
but I like Cuban's
technology idea,

08:42.043 --> 08:44.045
and he owns that company
that has a piece of it.

08:44.088 --> 08:47.570
How about we partner,
Cuban and I, 50/50,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.006
offer you the $400,000?

08:49.050 --> 08:50.573
We'll do it for 25%.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.317
Actually, what we should
do is we should see

08:55.360 --> 08:58.059
if Peter wants to come in
and go to the 33%,

08:58.102 --> 09:00.452
but let Peter handle
the international,

09:00.496 --> 09:03.238
Kevin handle the weddings
and everything.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.240
I can deal with
the technological side.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.111
Now, we'd still need the 33%.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.765
That gives us enough each
to care.

09:08.809 --> 09:09.810
If Peter's
in for that.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.203
I would love to do that.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.554
Come on, guys,
give me some room here.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.468
Hey, why don't we
take it up to 40%?

09:16.512 --> 09:17.644
I'm gonna add the diversity.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.210
No.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.429
You know how close I am
with the music community.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.039
Come on, man.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.780
Wait, listen, this is gonna be
a social-media play, right?

09:23.824 --> 09:25.434
African-Americans,
we like to talk.

09:25.477 --> 09:28.176
So, why don't you let me in
on it a little bit?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.743
- Give me a little sidewalk here.
- O'Daymond, Daymond.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.005
Another 7%,
we all split it.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.484
I'm feeling very left out
all of a sudden.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.617
Can you sing, Lori?

09:34.661 --> 09:35.792
Right now we've got --

09:35.836 --> 09:36.880
we're gonna throw Daymond
under the bus

09:36.924 --> 09:39.448
unless you're willing
to go to 40%

09:39.491 --> 09:41.015
to give us 10% each.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.365
Then we get everything he's got
on social.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.888
You got four Sharks.
We love the deal.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.324
Everybody brings
something special.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.717
To go to 40%, we should put in
a little bit more money.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.066
Agreed.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.720
So that it should be 500K
at that point.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.939
Done.
Right?

09:51.982 --> 09:53.897
Now, look,
it seems like a lot,

09:53.941 --> 09:56.726
but, effectively, we're letting
you just stay creative

09:56.770 --> 09:59.120
and you guys will own
the majority still.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.558
But you've got four people
who touch every base,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.299
so that makes it a home run.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.517
We'd like to counter offer.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.738
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.348
If you guys don't mind,
- please?
- No, go ahead.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.699
Think about the amount of money
that you would have to pay

10:12.742 --> 10:15.179
to get four Sharks like us.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.833
You know,
the expertise that we bring

10:16.877 --> 10:18.530
is extreme in this case.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.929
Let's say $700,000.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.496
You do what you think is best.
Okay?

10:31.935 --> 10:35.722
So, I'm just going
to counter with this.

10:35.765 --> 10:39.247
Can we do $800,000,
40%?

10:42.990 --> 10:44.382
I think you might be
too greedy now.

10:44.426 --> 10:48.169
I think you've got a good deal
at $500,000 at 40%.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.998
O'If you give us the 40%,
we will blow this thing up,

10:51.041 --> 10:54.175
and your competitors
will be in the dust.

10:54.218 --> 10:57.047
You'll be playing tunes
of woe and misery for them.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
Alright,
you guys got a deal.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.710
Yeah!

11:07.754 --> 11:08.798
Good job.

11:08.842 --> 11:09.581
Good job, Peter.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.192
O'Fantastic.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.934
Oh, I thought you were
gonna lose that one.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.152
- I'm so excited for you.
- Thank you so much.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.937
That was
- really impressive.
- Thank you.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.547
Thank you.
- We're so excited, you guys.
- Congratulations.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.722
- Well done.
- This is wonderful.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.115
- Alright!
- Thank you.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.900
Congratulations.
Well done!

11:23.944 --> 11:25.597
Thank you.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.077
I know.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.213
- I feel like crying.
- I know.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.258
It's gonna be big.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.782
I think it will be big.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.789
I was born in a small town
in England called Langley.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.139
I come from
a really hardworking family,

11:45.182 --> 11:48.272
and I think that that's
an essence of my identity.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.753
I struggled at school.
I found it really difficult.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.408
My parents wanted me
to get a good education,

11:53.451 --> 11:55.192
go and get a nine-to-five job.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.672
There was always something
inside me, though,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.631
that wanted something different.

11:59.675 --> 12:02.460
I used to play a lot of tennis,
and at the age of 16,

12:02.504 --> 12:05.463
I started my first business,
the Peter Jones tennis academy.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.379
It started out with five people.
Then it grew to 40 people.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.641
The next thing I knew,

12:09.685 --> 12:11.252
wow, I've got a serious business
on my hand.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.080
Whilst I was still doing
my tennis academy,

12:13.123 --> 12:15.125
I'd read about this guy,
Michael Dell,

12:15.169 --> 12:17.214
building computers
in his bedroom, and I thought,

12:17.258 --> 12:18.607
"You know what?
I could do that."

12:18.650 --> 12:20.261
The minute I left school at 18,

12:20.304 --> 12:22.742
I was learning about
how to build a computer.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.352
By the time I'm 21,

12:24.395 --> 12:26.789
I found myself with this
incredible computer business.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.574
I had my own house, had
beautiful cars, and I thought,

12:29.618 --> 12:31.141
"This is amazing.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.404
Business isn't that difficult,
is it?"

12:33.448 --> 12:35.580
Until recession
hit in the U.K.,

12:35.624 --> 12:38.322
and then everything
came crashing down.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.672
Companies that owed me money
couldn't afford to pay me.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.849
I'm now having to sell my house,
sell my cars.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.764
It was a dark, dark moment.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.722
But then that word "failure"
kept on resonating,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.028
and that was my eureka moment.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.594
I just went, "Hang on a minute.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.944
There's no such thing
as failure."

12:50.987 --> 12:52.859
That's feedback.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.644
I ended up getting a job
at Siemens,

12:55.687 --> 12:57.385
massive computer company.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.083
I started in sales and
marketing, and I also thought,

13:00.127 --> 13:02.129
"You know what? This business
could do so much more."

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
Some of the decisions
that I made,

13:03.739 --> 13:05.872
I'm proud to say that
the business made a profit

13:05.915 --> 13:07.438
for the first time
in a long time.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.788
In nine months,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.920
we were so successful
that the chairman decided

13:10.964 --> 13:12.095
that I should be
running the business.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.924
In 1998,
I started a telecoms company.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.839
I knew that mobile phones

13:16.883 --> 13:18.145
were gonna be
the next big thing.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.973
I started with $10,000.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.626
By the time
I got to my fifth year,

13:21.670 --> 13:23.803
we turned over a quarter
of a billion dollars,

13:23.846 --> 13:25.892
and, boy, was I happy.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.981
I like
impossible challenges.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.199
Good.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.680
I've been on
"Dragons' Den" since 2005 --

13:31.723 --> 13:34.378
longest-standing Dragon --
or Shark, for that matter --

13:34.422 --> 13:35.510
anywhere in the world.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.555
So I can't wait
to get into the tank

13:37.599 --> 13:39.340
and breathe a little bit of fire
on a few of them,

13:39.383 --> 13:40.689
particularly Kevin.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.909
Even though I'm on
"Dragons' Den" in the U.K.,

13:42.952 --> 13:45.041
"Shark Tank,"
it's the Super League.

13:45.085 --> 13:48.175
In my opinion, America is the
pinnacle of entrepreneurship.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.916
There's something
uniquely different

13:49.959 --> 13:51.700
about the American dream.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.310
Three!

13:53.354 --> 13:55.878
The experience I learned
from literally losing everything

13:55.922 --> 13:58.794
was probably one of the
greatest experiences of my life.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.883
It's made me really care
about other people,

14:00.927 --> 14:03.103
and I want to help people
achieve their dreams.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.800
It's one of the reasons
why I do "Dragons' Den,"

14:04.844 --> 14:07.629
and it's certainly the reason
why I'm here to do "Shark Tank."

14:20.947 --> 14:22.687
Next up is a product

14:22.731 --> 14:26.126
inspired by
our new work-from-home normal.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.788
Hi, Sharks, my name is Parm,
like Parmesan.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.920
I know it's cheesy.

14:37.964 --> 14:38.921
I'm from
Sacramento, California,

14:38.965 --> 14:40.357
and the CEO of MuteMe.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.185
And I'm Tye,
like the tie that you wear,

14:42.229 --> 14:44.840
and I'm also from Sacramento,
California, and the CFO.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.711
We're here today asking
for $200,000

14:46.755 --> 14:50.063
in exchange for 10%
of our company, MuteMe.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.021
And joining us virtually today
are our two other cofounders,

14:52.065 --> 14:55.285
and wives,
Handeep and Brittany.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.418
<i> Hi, Sharks! I'm so excited
to be here today. </i>

14:57.461 --> 14:58.810
<i> My name is Handeep,</i>

14:58.854 --> 15:00.900
<i> and I'm the chief operating
officer at MuteMe. </i>

15:00.943 --> 15:03.032
<i> I'm Brittany, and I'm the chief
marketing officer at MuteMe. </i>

15:03.076 --> 15:04.512
We wish they could be here
with us today.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.035
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

15:06.079 --> 15:07.907
<i>They're so lucky
we let them on the Tank. </i>

15:07.950 --> 15:09.952
<i> We're the real talent.
We should have been on there. </i>

15:09.996 --> 15:11.606
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

15:11.649 --> 15:14.000
<i>You know it took Tye a month
to memorize his five lines? </i>

15:14.043 --> 15:15.653
<i>I had them down in a day.
We would have been flawless. </i>

15:15.697 --> 15:17.220
<i> We would have been.</i>

15:17.264 --> 15:18.265
- We can hear you!
- We can hear you!

15:19.788 --> 15:21.007
<i>There's got to be
a better way. </i>

15:21.050 --> 15:22.399
Well, now there is!

15:22.443 --> 15:23.966
Sharks, this is MuteMe,

15:24.010 --> 15:25.576
the world's first
illuminated mute button.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.230
You press MuteMe
when you need to be muted,

15:27.274 --> 15:29.537
the lights change color
so it's never disputed.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.234
Tap it again
when it's your turn to speak.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.628
The light stops you from letting
the wrong words leak.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.412
It's a perfect tool
when you're multitasking

15:35.456 --> 15:37.197
or when you have a coworker
like Mr. Wonderful

15:37.240 --> 15:38.981
who keeps on ranting.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.896
It helps others around you know
if you're busy.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.507
No more wondering, "Hey,
he's not on a call, is he?"

15:43.551 --> 15:44.944
Stainless steel
is super neat.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.989
Custom engraving,
it can't be beat.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.383
It's the hottest product
of the year.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.211
No more conference-call slipups
or fears.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.952
Whether you're working
or learning,

15:52.995 --> 15:54.779
our button
makes things easy.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.086
Don't worry, we know
this rhyme's pretty cheesy.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.220
Sharks, we hope you found our
pitch just a little bit funny.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.744
But unmute yourselves,
it's time to make some money.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.180
There you go.
- I like that.
- There you go.
Good job.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.531
So run through, really quick,
all the scenarios.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.055
Just give me
like four or five

16:09.098 --> 16:10.447
where you think
someone would use this.

16:10.491 --> 16:14.234
So, 2020, one of the
top lines that was used was,

16:14.277 --> 16:15.539
"You're on mute.""You're on mute."

16:15.583 --> 16:17.411
And how many times
have you heard a dog bark,

16:17.454 --> 16:18.847
doorbell ring,
different scenarios

16:18.890 --> 16:20.240
while someone's talking

16:20.283 --> 16:21.806
and they don't realize
they're on mute?

16:21.850 --> 16:23.286
Everyone's trying
to get their attention,

16:23.330 --> 16:26.115
and they just don't have
that indication that they are.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.030
Why not just do
a browser extension, though,

16:28.074 --> 16:29.640
and just make it really,
really big on the screen

16:29.684 --> 16:31.033
where everybody's looking?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.556
Because it takes up
screen real estate.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.341
You don't want to take up
additional space on your screen.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.386
There's like eight different
conferencing platforms, right?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.040
When you're interfacing
with all those different

16:38.084 --> 16:40.173
conferencing platforms,
it's not easy.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.044
So our button,
you plug it in,

16:42.088 --> 16:43.524
you press the button,
it mutes and unmutes.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.134
How much are you
selling them for?

16:45.178 --> 16:47.310
We're selling them
for $39 retail.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.442
And what
do they cost to make?

16:48.485 --> 16:51.227
It's $11.62 right now.

16:51.271 --> 16:52.837
How did
you come up with this?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.404
And tell us
about your background.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.406
We actually have a mutual friend
that came up with the idea.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.018
I worked on a remote working
project with him two years ago.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.541
And Tye is
the technical marketing manager

17:00.584 --> 17:02.456
at the largest all-remote
company in the world.

17:02.499 --> 17:03.848
So we decided to go down
the path

17:03.892 --> 17:05.154
of developing
something ourselves.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.938
We prototyped it
in about a month,

17:06.982 --> 17:09.593
launched a Kickstarter,
and it just takes off.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.769
Give me an idea
- what "take off" means.
- Yeah, what is "take off"?

17:11.813 --> 17:13.075
Yeah, so we did --

17:13.119 --> 17:14.816
So, we did 145,000
on Kickstarter.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.035
Dollars or units?

17:16.078 --> 17:16.905
Dollars.
Dollars.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.863
And Indiegogo was $135,000,

17:18.907 --> 17:22.084
so we did $280,000
in crowdfunding.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.607
What about real sales?
What's happened?

17:23.651 --> 17:25.870
We've done $61,000.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.525
$61,000.
How'd you sell them?

17:28.569 --> 17:29.874
On our website.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.789
You'll want to know also
we are in every Staples

17:31.833 --> 17:33.095
in the United States.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.315
- You are?
- The last four weeks.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.056
But what have they sold
in these last four weeks?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.580
So we've sold just over
150 units.

17:39.623 --> 17:40.929
That's it?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.844
Where are they putting it
in the store?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.106
Very front.
If you walk into

17:44.150 --> 17:45.977
a Staples right now,
there's a table there.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.501
What have they said
about the feedback?

17:47.544 --> 17:49.155
Because 150 units is low.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.200
They haven't promoted us
in any marketing yet,

17:51.244 --> 17:52.854
and that's to come
in the next couple of weeks.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.116
Well, no,
they are promoting you,

17:54.160 --> 17:55.596
because they've basically
got walk-in trade,

17:55.639 --> 17:56.771
and it's the first thing
you see.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.729
Footfall overall everywhere

17:58.773 --> 18:00.862
is not where it should be
as of right now.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.820
No, but hold on, hold on.
I think Peter's asking
a great question.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.126
I mean, to back that up, though,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.954
did they tell you the tests
on how many doors

18:05.997 --> 18:06.824
they're putting you in?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.087
1,067 stores.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.479
Every store
in the United States.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.525
We've gone to a lot of stores,
and the one thing

18:11.568 --> 18:13.135
that we're trying to get them
to do most often is,

18:13.179 --> 18:14.919
you see the value
in the illumination.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.486
- Yes.
- And that's something that

18:16.530 --> 18:18.401
the stores run a battery pack,
and the battery pack dies.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.577
You've got to come up
with a way to sell it.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.231
Do something fun with it
on TikTok.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.452
You have got to be
great content creators.

18:25.495 --> 18:26.975
You're a product,

18:27.018 --> 18:28.672
and you haven't figured out
how to sell it.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.283
I mean, you're not even close.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.936
That's what I think you need
to be successful.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.764
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.505
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mark.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.681
I think this goes to zero
in retail.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.075
In about 90 days, it'll be in
the discount bin for nine bucks.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
That's not a problem.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.948
This should be
completely done online.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.429
Part of
the strategy is actually a
business-to-business strategy.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.170
Because the top
is stainless steel,

18:48.214 --> 18:49.693
it can be laser engraved
with any logo.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.000
So we've had a lot of customers
where they've --

18:52.043 --> 18:53.523
Stop selling for a second
because I want a minute
just to drop out.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.571
I'm gone, I'm out, I'm history.
Thank you.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.269
Sorry to hear that.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.358
What you've done here is
you've created a great product

19:02.402 --> 19:03.838
that's come out of the pandemic.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.753
I've got a company in Asia.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.189
It's like
the third- or fourth-largest

19:07.233 --> 19:08.886
gadget company online.

19:08.930 --> 19:12.325
We sell tens of millions' worth
of gadgets, and I'm thinking,

19:12.368 --> 19:13.630
"Could I sell this?"

19:13.674 --> 19:15.241
I think I could.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.982
But, sadly, it's going to be
a race to the bottom on price.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.680
That's where I think it's at.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.899
You have other competitors
in this market?

19:21.943 --> 19:23.162
So we're first to market.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.380
There are some competitors
out there

19:24.424 --> 19:25.686
that are trying to --

19:25.729 --> 19:27.427
They saw our Kickstarter
and decided to ramp up.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.863
Do you have any I.P.
at all on it?

19:28.906 --> 19:30.299
We do.
We have a provisional patent.

19:30.343 --> 19:33.302
So we're the only mute button
that isn't a microphone.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.130
That's not bad.
It could be worse.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.088
We work with
- all the microphones.
- No, it's good.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.395
So we're the only mute button
that's not a microphone
and is illuminated.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.441
We have factories in Shenzhen.
I can make this for you now.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.138
We'd love
to work with you.
We'd love
to work with you.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.487
Make that happen.
Yeah, yeah.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.228
You've got no proprietary
circuit board in here.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.621
This is probably, at volume,

19:47.664 --> 19:51.190
less than 70 or 80 cents,
in time.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.236
Yeah, we we are currently
manufacturing it at $11.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.542
Ouch.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.804
We would love to work
with any one of you.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.806
I'll give you an offer.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.287
But the problem is,
I have to redo your business.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.202
Every one of the Sharks
said something that's critical.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.378
You know, you got to make
these things for $1.50.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.901
And at the end of the day,

20:06.944 --> 20:09.730
this has got to be $19.99,
maybe $14.99.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.254
- I think it's $9.99.
- I mean, certain companies are
targeting something like $9.99.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.343
So, anyway, unfortunately,

20:14.387 --> 20:15.910
I have to give you
a very Sharky offer.

20:15.953 --> 20:19.000
$200,000 for 50%.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.175
50%?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.742
Ooh.5-0.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.483
- 5-0.
- That's not an unreasonable offer

20:23.526 --> 20:25.049
for what you guys got here.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.790
The valuation is crazy.
It is crazy.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.575
But I have to put
so much work in,

20:28.618 --> 20:30.403
I probably am gonna have to
give percentages

20:30.446 --> 20:31.055
to a bunch of people.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.276
What do you think?

20:34.320 --> 20:35.930
Why don't you see if you can get
an offer from somebody else?

20:35.973 --> 20:38.715
If you don't,
- that's the only offer you got.
- That's true.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.630
Well, if you don't get
an offer from somebody else,
then it's gonna go up.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.330
Who's still in?
Are we -- three of us?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.287
No, I hate this.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.898
Tell us
what you really think.

20:49.378 --> 20:52.338
Listen, guys, I see
the benefit of it.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.122
I'm so on the fence about it.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.821
And whenever I feel that way,
I have to go with my gut.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.388
And I'm so sorry,
but I'm out.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.218
Guys, so...

21:03.262 --> 21:05.481
I'm really torn.

21:05.525 --> 21:06.830
Be torn towards us.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.050
No, I'm really torn.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.747
If I do this and I go back
and my guys say,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.314
"What the
are you doing? Because..."

21:14.925 --> 21:16.449
"You're just investing
in a button

21:16.492 --> 21:18.886
that goes red and green.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.062
We could create that tomorrow."

21:21.105 --> 21:23.586
And I just -- I feel really
quite worried about that.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.285
Hey, you know what, guys?
I'm out.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.900
The thing is, there's a lot
of simple things out there
that sell well.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.250
Just because it's simple
doesn't necessarily mean
that it's a bad idea.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.817
Seriously, guys,
I'm really sorry,

21:36.860 --> 21:38.253
but I'm going
to have to say I'm out.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.170
Alright.
We appreciate it.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.345
Good luck, guys.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.434
- Alright, take care, guys.
- Appreciate it.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.349
- That's a tough one.
- Yeah.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.394
They messed up.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.482
I think
they look at something

21:49.525 --> 21:50.352
and they think it's simple.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.875
They don't necessarily,

21:51.919 --> 21:53.703
you know, think that
this is gonna grow,

21:53.747 --> 21:54.965
but I know
it's gonna grow.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.358
It's gonna be something
that's gonna end up

21:56.402 --> 21:57.620
on a lot
of students' desks.

21:57.664 --> 21:58.882
They're gonna be sorry
in a couple years,

21:58.926 --> 22:00.231
and that's okay.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.842
It's gonna be the Ring doorbell
all over again.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.322
The Ring doorbell
all over again.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.975
The only good thing
about this

22:05.019 --> 22:07.108
is if it actually worked
for real on people.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
Next in the Tank

22:22.558 --> 22:25.648
is a food business that's as
convenient as it is healthy.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.356
Hello, Sharks.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.488
This is
Christopher Jane.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.185
And this
is Jennifer Jane.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.665
We're based
in Austin, Texas,

22:42.709 --> 22:45.625
and together we are the sibling
founders of Proper Good.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.757
We're here today
seeking $400,000

22:47.801 --> 22:49.063
in exchange for 10%

22:49.106 --> 22:51.413
of our wonderful
natural foods company.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.850
So, what is Proper Good?

22:53.894 --> 22:55.417
Proper Good
makes the tastiest

22:55.461 --> 22:57.593
and most convenient
90-second meals ever made

22:57.637 --> 22:59.595
And who are
these meals for?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.337
For busy people who care about
what they put in their bodies.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.078
So whether you're plant-based,
ketogenic,

23:04.121 --> 23:05.906
gluten-free, or dairy-free,

23:05.949 --> 23:07.647
we have got the meals
for your lifestyle.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.910
Well, that sounds divine!

23:09.953 --> 23:12.086
So how do people
get these meals?

23:12.129 --> 23:13.566
Ah, well,
that couldn't be easier.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.655
We ship direct to you
from the Proper Good website

23:15.698 --> 23:18.222
in a wonderful,
lovely little box with 12 meals

23:18.266 --> 23:21.530
with no extra packaging,
no insulation, and no dry ice.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.053
Oh, wait a minute.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.969
Are you telling me
there's no refrigeration needed?

23:26.013 --> 23:27.231
Quite right.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.798
All Proper Good meals
are shelf-stable

23:28.842 --> 23:31.322
for up to eight months,
meaning no fridge needed,

23:31.366 --> 23:34.195
so you can enjoy them at home,
at work, or on the go

23:34.238 --> 23:36.458
whenever you need
a 90-second meal in a pinch.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.938
It's like having
a wonderful little chef

23:37.981 --> 23:39.113
in your pocket.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.158
By Jove,
that <i>does</i> sound good.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.203
Quite good.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.726
- Proper Good.
- Proper Good.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.816
So, Sharks, who's ready to make
a Proper Good investment?

23:46.860 --> 23:48.818
That was
absolutely first-class.

23:48.862 --> 23:49.863
Are you really English?

23:49.906 --> 23:51.473
- We are, indeed, yes.
- Yes, we are.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.780
So we grew up on "Dragons' Den"
and watching you.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.825
So when we heard that you
were here, we were delighted.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.305
- Yes.
- Fantastic.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.524
So today
I'm your favorite Shark?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.308
Indeed.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.918
Oh, thank you. How do you feel
about that, Mr. Wonderful?

24:01.962 --> 24:03.093
Alright, I'm out.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, early mistakes.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.184
What do we have?

24:07.228 --> 24:10.492
Yes, so all of the Sharks
to my right,

24:10.536 --> 24:13.408
you all have our Red Pepper
and Meatball soup,

24:13.452 --> 24:14.714
which is our best seller.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.672
That's why it's
in the crown jewels there.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.457
And also Chicken Noodle,

24:18.500 --> 24:21.285
which is an elevated version
of the classic.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.637
And then, Mark, you have two
of our vegan options,

24:24.680 --> 24:27.770
which is the Southwest Chili
with plant-based meat,

24:27.814 --> 24:30.469
and then also
a Quinoa Brown Rice Blend.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.774
It's really nice.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.384
It's good.
- I'm eating the meatball.
- Thank you.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.125
- Excellent.It's very good.
- Wonderful.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.258
Very tasty.
Good.
Thank you.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.348
How much does that box cost,
and what do you sell it for?

24:40.391 --> 24:43.482
Average product price is around
$7, including free delivery.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.092
- That's for one. One meal.
- For one.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.877
So with a subscription, though,
all of our meals are $5.99,

24:47.921 --> 24:49.009
including free shipping.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.228
So that makes the box $72
for the 12.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.100
If you sell it for $72,
what does it cost you to make?

24:53.143 --> 24:55.537
Cost for us to make it?
Around $30.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.671
And for any given package,
the range for your cost?

24:58.714 --> 25:02.283
Our cost is $2 to $2.50.
We're at about 65% gross.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.503
But I could eat it
right out of the pouch, right,

25:04.546 --> 25:06.026
without even heating it
if I wanted?

25:06.069 --> 25:07.723
- Correct.
- You can eat it cold
if you want.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.073
Yeah, and we found
a few different industries,

25:10.117 --> 25:12.685
such as nurses and truckers
in particular,

25:12.728 --> 25:14.121
that love
that nature of it,

25:14.164 --> 25:16.036
the fact
that it's already cooked

25:16.079 --> 25:17.690
and you can eat it hot
- or cold.
- Yeah.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.779
And what have your sales been
so far?

25:19.822 --> 25:20.910
We launched in 2020,
April.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.869
Year one we did,
of calendar year,

25:22.912 --> 25:25.349
$556,000 in sales.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.133
That's great.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.264
Year to date this year,

25:27.308 --> 25:28.570
we're obviously
about 50% through,

25:28.614 --> 25:29.832
we've done
just over a million.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.355
- Whoa.
- Wow.

25:31.399 --> 25:34.141
This is all direct to consumer,
- almost 100%.
- Wow.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.272
- Good for you.
- What is generating
these sales?

25:35.316 --> 25:36.926
What are you doing
to get customers?

25:36.970 --> 25:38.537
Through COVID,
we saw a lot of people

25:38.580 --> 25:39.886
go to shop online, right?

25:39.929 --> 25:41.583
- Right.
- They started to adopt
e-commerce behavior.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.672
And really, we are truly
the only company

25:43.716 --> 25:45.587
offering premium
shelf-stable meals.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.415
Chris and Jen, you know,

25:47.458 --> 25:49.591
I love what you're doing, I love
the packaging, everything.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.376
I don't generally eat soups,
but it's something

25:52.420 --> 25:54.901
that I wouldn't be able
to really be passionate about.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.860
So I wish you luck, and I loved
the presentation.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.601
I'm out.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.994
Okay, thank you
- for the time.
- Thank you, Daymond.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.865
I think
you're onto something.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.520
I think your sales
are indicative of that

26:05.564 --> 26:09.655
because that's really fast
growth in a pandemic.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.440
But you're a little bit
too early for me right now.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.964
I'd like to see it
have more flavors

26:15.008 --> 26:16.618
and a little more
tried and true.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.273
And solely for those reasons,
I'm out.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.624
Understood.
- Thank you for the feedback.
- Thank you, Lori.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.018
Can I just ask a question
about your profit?

26:25.061 --> 26:26.672
What was your profit
on just that

26:26.715 --> 26:28.064
just over a million?

26:28.108 --> 26:30.327
Sure, no, so we are very much
losing money right now

26:30.371 --> 26:32.373
on a customer-acquisition
standpoint.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.767
Let's just break it down
from that million, year to date,

26:34.810 --> 26:37.944
is around $550,000
in gross margin,

26:37.987 --> 26:40.555
There's around $300,000
in net margin.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.774
But overall,
yeah, company to date

26:41.817 --> 26:43.906
has raised
about $2 million.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.169
Oh.
- Oh.
- So we are
losing money today

26:46.213 --> 26:48.476
to acquire customers,
- build products.
- Okay.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.261
Okay, so your cost of
acquisition, then, is huge.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.263
So it's about $32

26:53.307 --> 26:55.483
if you take
your total year-one marketing

26:55.526 --> 26:57.093
over total year-one customers.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.487
But that puts us profitable on
a second order with customers.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.967
And how much are you burning
per month?

27:01.010 --> 27:01.837
$80,000.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.754
Guys, I like the product,
I like the idea,

27:05.798 --> 27:07.147
I think it's going to work.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.671
I much prefer, however,
to invest in a company

27:09.715 --> 27:11.760
that can give me two numbers.

27:11.804 --> 27:14.284
Customer-acquisition cost
and lifetime value.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.635
Because if you had
already arrived at a place

27:16.678 --> 27:18.985
where you said to me,
"Look, Kevin, lifetime value

27:19.028 --> 27:21.988
is 250 bucks,
acquisition is $18,"

27:22.031 --> 27:24.207
- it's a no-brainer.
- Sure.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.557
All we have to do is fight about
- what percentage I get.
- Correct.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.256
That's it.
You're not there yet.

27:29.299 --> 27:32.694
For me, not ready.
It's not pasteurized enough yet.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.653
The model isn't nailed down.
I'm out.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.263
Okay.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.439
I really like it.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.354
I think you've produced
a really good quality product.

27:40.397 --> 27:41.572
Thank you.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.575
However, I've been in this
market before

27:44.619 --> 27:46.142
with Barenaked Foods,

27:46.186 --> 27:47.927
and one of the big things
that we got right

27:47.970 --> 27:51.365
was that specific
cost of acquisition

27:51.408 --> 27:52.845
- at the starting point.
- Yep.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.411
And what actually
ends up happening

27:54.455 --> 27:55.543
in businesses like this

27:55.586 --> 27:57.588
is that you have
a high level of entry.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.590
And whilst you think
you can change

27:59.634 --> 28:02.419
to the subscription model,
you will demonstrate

28:02.463 --> 28:04.291
that your customer acquisition
will go down.
Sure.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.380
When you start to bring out
your new ranges,

28:06.423 --> 28:08.948
your cost of acquisition
goes through the roof again

28:08.991 --> 28:13.082
and you go in a never-ending
cycle of actually massive burn,

28:13.126 --> 28:14.997
and you need more
and more investment.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.521
And that's why what happens
is, to businesses like this,

28:17.565 --> 28:20.307
the founders, sadly, end up
with tiny equity at the end.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.613
They end up shorting,
ultimately, the investor

28:22.657 --> 28:25.529
at the front end, and you end up
diluting and diluting,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.183
and it's a race to the bottom.

28:27.227 --> 28:30.926
And that's the only reason why
I'm gonna say, sadly, I'm out.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.885
Okay, understood.
Thank you.

28:32.928 --> 28:37.150
You guys, I know how to make
this thing huge, right?

28:37.193 --> 28:40.370
I'm afraid you guys
might hold me back.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.677
Because when you have a product
that's functional

28:42.721 --> 28:44.723
and it's the message itself,

28:44.766 --> 28:46.942
then you just got to
let it sell, right?

28:46.986 --> 28:48.683
Would you be willing
to change your marketing

28:48.727 --> 28:49.945
and to change your packaging?

28:49.989 --> 28:53.079
Yes, we --
well, "data over ego"

28:53.122 --> 28:54.689
is our kind of
- little mantra.
- Perfect. Okay.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.734
- Perfect.
- So, yes, definitely.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.735
I'll make you an offer.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.696
It's gonna be Sharky, but
this is what it's gonna take.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.351
And I have the team to do it
and the results to prove it.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.093
So I'll offer you the $400,000,
but I want 25%.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.399
- Okay.
- Mm!

29:09.443 --> 29:11.401
Well,
- thank you for the offer.
- Thank you.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.534
- Mm!
- Because you should be able
to go from a million

29:13.577 --> 29:15.101
to $25 million

29:15.144 --> 29:17.756
within three
to four years easily,

29:17.799 --> 29:20.019
if not faster, and you should
be able to cut your CAC

29:20.062 --> 29:21.934
- to next to nothing.
- Yep.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.110
But, you know, focusing on
fitness and travel

29:24.153 --> 29:27.026
and all these different things
and just using earned media.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.376
Would it be okay to hear
if there's any other offers
on the table?

29:29.419 --> 29:30.246
They're all out.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.682
I think they're all out.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.946
Oh, just one? I thought --
I forgot he was out.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.164
Okay, um...
Yeah.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.339
We're all on Mark.

29:36.383 --> 29:37.645
Do you want to take
a minute to talk,

29:37.688 --> 29:39.342
or what do you want
to do here?

29:39.386 --> 29:41.518
Would you consider 20%?

29:45.914 --> 29:47.220
I would do 20%.

29:47.263 --> 29:48.438
Alright,
- let's make it happen.
- Deal.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.310
Let's do it.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.398
Alright.
Good.

29:51.441 --> 29:52.442
Congrats, guys.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.661
- O'Excellent.
- Thank you.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.923
That's proper good.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.055
We're gonna make
a lot of money.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.360
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

29:57.404 --> 29:58.492
- Well done.
- Pleasure.
Thank you so much.

29:58.535 --> 29:59.885
- Lovely. Bye-bye.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.234
- Thanks, guys.
- Alright, hands up.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.020
Nice!
Awesome.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.761
Ooh, it was touch-and-go
for a moment.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.676
It was.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.591
Of course we're a little bit sad
not to get

30:10.634 --> 30:12.506
the fellow Englishman
in the Shark Tank,

30:12.549 --> 30:14.987
but we are delighted
to be with Mark Cuban

30:15.030 --> 30:16.510
and really excited
to grow this.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.033
It really is good.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.688
- I'd say it's quite good.
- Oh, it's Proper Good.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.963
Next up
is an apparel company

30:35.007 --> 30:37.270
focused on helping our oceans.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.890
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Michael Lamagna.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.326
I'm Lauren Lamagna.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.720
And we're salty siblings
from New England.

30:52.763 --> 30:56.855
We're here
seeking a $375,000 investment

30:56.898 --> 30:58.595
for 15% of our business,

30:58.639 --> 31:00.641
the Long Wharf
Supply Co.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.122
It's no secret that
ocean plastics are one of

31:03.165 --> 31:06.255
the biggest environmental
challenges of our generation.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.954
Additionally, millions of pounds
of oyster shells

31:08.997 --> 31:12.000
are discarded every year
and end up in landfills,

31:12.044 --> 31:14.046
eventually turning toxic
over time

31:14.089 --> 31:15.612
while contributing
to global waste.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.050
And that's why we're
turning waste into wool.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.791
We created the first
fisherman's sweaters made

31:20.835 --> 31:23.751
from a soft blend
of recycled oyster shells,

31:23.794 --> 31:26.885
recycled water bottles,
and natural lambswool.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.714
Each sweater sold
reseeds up to 30 oysters.

31:30.758 --> 31:34.675
To date, we've reseeded
over 70,000 oysters,

31:34.718 --> 31:38.984
which naturally filter
3.5 million gallons of seawater

31:39.027 --> 31:41.334
in our local waterways
every day.

31:41.377 --> 31:44.163
- Wow.
- By creating high-quality
and timeless garments

31:44.206 --> 31:46.426
that promote the use
of recycled materials

31:46.469 --> 31:49.820
and that directly support
reseeding coastal oyster reefs,

31:49.864 --> 31:51.997
we hope to reduce waste
and clean up

31:52.040 --> 31:54.477
our inshore waterways
for the next generation.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.828
So, Sharks, now that we've got
a hook in the water,

31:57.872 --> 31:59.047
who's ready to take the bait?

32:00.701 --> 32:02.529
This is
- a really nice sweater.
- Thank you.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.096
- It is really nice.
- - Really good quality.

32:04.139 --> 32:07.142
Super soft.
I mean, it really feels nice.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.970
It's got, like, that --
a good weight,

32:09.014 --> 32:11.233
but also like
something you'd want to put on.

32:11.277 --> 32:14.236
What's the percentage of
the lambswool to the recycled?

32:14.280 --> 32:18.545
It's 10% lambswool and 50%
of our recycled material.

32:18.588 --> 32:19.633
Really?50%?

32:19.676 --> 32:22.070
The other 40%
is 20% nylon

32:22.114 --> 32:24.507
and 20%
plant-based viscose.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.379
So for those who don't know,

32:26.422 --> 32:29.948
one oyster filters
how much water a day?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.340
I'm glad you asked.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.125
People are floored to learn

32:33.168 --> 32:36.606
that 50 gallons
of seawater per day

32:36.650 --> 32:38.478
are filtered by each oyster.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.220
I filmed a little experiment
for you

32:41.263 --> 32:42.395
so you can see it
with your own eyes.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.310
We filled two tanks
with mucky seawater,

32:44.353 --> 32:46.921
placed 60 oysters
in the tanks.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.531
If you'll notice
by the end here,

32:48.575 --> 32:50.664
the tank on the right
gets pretty clear.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.971
- People are blown away.
- What was
that period of time?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.755
- For two hours.
- That was
two hours alone?

32:54.798 --> 32:56.887
Only takes you two hours
to clean that much?

32:56.931 --> 32:58.193
For that time-lapse,
yes.
For that, yeah.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.021
Wow,
that's pretty interesting.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.718
So, what's your backstory?

33:01.762 --> 33:03.503
Yeah, absolutely.

33:03.546 --> 33:07.072
After graduating, I moved back
to Boston initially to work for

33:07.115 --> 33:09.726
one of the most successful
e-commerce companies, Wayfair.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.946
- Mm-hmm.
- And I interned
in New York City,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.600
working for an entrepreneur

33:13.643 --> 33:16.646
who had cofounded
fashion label Tory Burch,

33:16.690 --> 33:18.257
was hired as an associate.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.172
It was my dream job.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.522
Unfortunately,
I got caught up in layoffs,

33:22.565 --> 33:24.350
and I just did what I knew
how to do best --

33:24.393 --> 33:26.482
Go back
and jump on lobster boats.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.354
And during those years,
I looked around

33:28.397 --> 33:31.313
and I was floored
at how much plastic

33:31.357 --> 33:33.533
and waste
we'd pull out of the ocean.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.492
So I started thinking about
launching my own business.

33:36.536 --> 33:40.801
So Long Wharf originally started
at the end of 2016

33:40.844 --> 33:44.892
with a handful of waxed canvas
and leather goods.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.547
We actually launched the sweater
collection last year,

33:47.590 --> 33:48.896
12 months ago.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.463
So, what do these things
sell for?

33:50.506 --> 33:52.117
What are your margins?

33:52.160 --> 33:55.990
So we have just under
an 80% gross average margin.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.167
- Wow.
- They cost us $23.50
to $33.50 to make.

33:59.211 --> 34:02.475
And we sell them
for $128 to $158.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.738
Have you figured out your
customer acquisition cost yet?

34:04.781 --> 34:08.046
We have. Right now we can
acquire customers for $41.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.699
- That's expensive.
- O'$41?

34:09.743 --> 34:11.440
Give me the last three years
in sales.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.052
Yeah, so I just want to talk
about our pandemic pivot

34:14.095 --> 34:15.357
because it was a big part
of our story.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.837
It's never good when someone
asks you,

34:16.880 --> 34:17.881
"How much are you selling?"
and we get another story.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.144
And you change subject,
yeah.

34:19.187 --> 34:23.191
In the last 12 months,
we've sold $495,000.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.150
And is it just the two
of you running the company?

34:25.193 --> 34:27.326
Like, tell me
how is this operation being run.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.718
It's the two of us.

34:28.762 --> 34:32.200
I mean, it's bootstrapped,
nose to the grindstone,

34:32.244 --> 34:33.332
pounding down doors.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.550
You're doing everything,
though?

34:34.594 --> 34:36.117
Mike likes to tell stories,
doesn't he?

34:36.161 --> 34:37.771
- Mike's a storyteller, right?
- I'll jump in.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.773
He's Italian,
I'm Italian.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.601
If we're not talking,
we don't know what to do.

34:41.644 --> 34:44.734
But it's very much
an all-hands-on-deck
kind of effort.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.128
And are you 50/50 partners?

34:47.172 --> 34:49.565
No. Right now I own 100%
of the company.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.089
Michael.
You do?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.960
I do.
- He does.
- And what about Lauren?

34:53.003 --> 34:54.744
I still have
a full-time job

34:54.788 --> 34:56.006
and I'm working
on Long Wharf

34:56.050 --> 34:57.617
mornings, nights,
and weekends right now.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.619
Well, why doesn't Lauren
have a percentage?

34:59.662 --> 35:01.316
Yeah, why doesn't
Lauren have a percentage?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.754
There's a couple negotiations
we can do in this room today.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.626
Hey, who's the Shark?

35:06.669 --> 35:08.149
Hang on, Mike.
Just give me one second here.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.759
$375,000, 15%.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.197
$2.5 million valuation.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.677
$495,000 in sales.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.636
I get the oyster story.
That's really great.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.159
But it's a sweater business,
okay?

35:18.203 --> 35:20.466
Your worth
is sort of one-time sales.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.859
$375,000 --

35:22.903 --> 35:26.341
I'd need to have like
75% of it.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.300
We appreciate the offer,

35:28.343 --> 35:30.215
I haven't said ...but that deal's a little
too steep for us.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.131
He didn't
give an offer.

35:33.174 --> 35:35.263
O'
Mike, let me tell you --
the valuation's insane.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.831
The company's not even worth
$375,000 yet.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.224
You asked for too much money.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.182
I'm out.

35:41.226 --> 35:44.185
We appreciate it, Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you for your time.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.013
You know, I mean,
I'm really attracted to this

35:46.056 --> 35:49.016
because my daughter
is five years old.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.887
You know, they asked
all the kids in school,

35:50.931 --> 35:52.976
"What do you want to be?"
and two of the kids say,

35:53.020 --> 35:54.804
"I want to be a venture
capitalist when I get older."

35:54.848 --> 35:57.242
My daughter said,
"I want to pick up trash."

35:57.285 --> 35:58.721
Interesting.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.636
Nothing against
the hardworking men and women

36:00.680 --> 36:02.116
that clean up our cities.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.987
And I asked her, "Why do you
want to pick up trash?"

36:04.031 --> 36:05.772
And then she looked at me
at five years old

36:05.815 --> 36:07.904
with those big, beautiful eyes
and said,

36:07.948 --> 36:09.819
"Because I want to clean up
the world, Daddy."

36:09.863 --> 36:11.169
Right?
- Ohh.
- Aww.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.475
And so this
is something I want to do.

36:13.519 --> 36:16.826
It's something that
our kids need to understand.

36:16.870 --> 36:21.004
But the number is so much
to wrap our heads around,

36:21.048 --> 36:24.051
and I would be making
an uneducated decision

36:24.094 --> 36:26.009
and paying the most
I could for it.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.620
So we're trying to --So I have to pass.
I'm out.

36:27.663 --> 36:28.925
With that $375,000 --

36:28.969 --> 36:30.884
Oh, we appreciate
your time, Daymond.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.147
Um, I think
it's really interesting.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.889
You do think that there's a gap
in the market, don't you?

36:35.932 --> 36:37.238
We do.
I mean, we see ourselves

36:37.282 --> 36:40.546
becoming the face
of the circular economy.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.461
We believe that --That wasn't an opportunity
for a speech.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.027
It was just a statement.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.290
No, I'm just --

36:45.333 --> 36:47.553
What I'm looking at now is,

36:47.596 --> 36:49.990
is there actually
a market in that gap?

36:50.033 --> 36:52.122
Because I think
what your mission

36:52.166 --> 36:53.994
and what you're trying
to stand for is really great.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.778
How do you make this
into a business?

36:55.822 --> 36:58.390
Isn't there something bigger
that you could be doing

36:58.433 --> 37:00.914
that would be helping the oceans
in an even bigger way

37:00.957 --> 37:02.350
You don't like this business
at all?

37:02.394 --> 37:03.960
- No.
We'd like to get there,

37:04.004 --> 37:06.224
and I think we're on the track
to do that.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.660
Let me ask the question
a different way.

37:07.703 --> 37:10.140
Can you sell something
that everybody can afford to buy

37:10.184 --> 37:11.794
so everybody can participate,

37:11.838 --> 37:14.057
a T-shirt
that everybody can say,

37:14.101 --> 37:16.234
"Hey,
I'm supporting conservation

37:16.277 --> 37:20.063
and reclamation of oysters
and making the oceans better"?

37:20.107 --> 37:22.544
There's got to be
a path to scale.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.242
Yes, and there is.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.592
So, right now what we've been
talking to you guys about

37:26.635 --> 37:28.724
is our lambswool blend.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.857
But something that we're
working on

37:30.900 --> 37:33.207
is a cotton
and recycled-material blend.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.905
It's much more versatile
than our wool blend,

37:35.949 --> 37:38.299
which is made
to keep you warm.

37:38.343 --> 37:41.650
Just tell me, can you sell
a T-shirt for $29.95,

37:41.694 --> 37:44.218
make 60-plus percent margins,

37:44.262 --> 37:47.395
accomplish the same thing,
and sell five million of them?

37:47.439 --> 37:49.310
We think we can sell
five million of these sweaters.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.268
I'm out.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.055
We do appreciate
your time.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.491
You know what's a bummer?

37:56.535 --> 37:59.625
Mark's idea's a really great one
because people care.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.801
His daughter cares.
We all care, right?

38:01.844 --> 38:04.020
And we want to be able to
do things and get behind things,

38:04.064 --> 38:05.326
but, to Mark's point,

38:05.370 --> 38:08.634
in an affordable,
inexpensive way, a T-shirt.

38:08.677 --> 38:11.593
And when he said,
"How about doing that?
Can you tell me doing that?"

38:11.637 --> 38:12.942
And if you had said to him,
"Yes,"

38:12.986 --> 38:14.335
I would have said,
"Mark, I want to join you."

38:14.379 --> 38:16.337
But you didn't.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.904
- Look at Michael.
- - But you didn't.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.819
It was the moment
to jump in and say,

38:19.862 --> 38:22.343
"Yeah, you know what? It's a
good idea. We'll figure it out."

38:22.387 --> 38:24.258
We'll make anything
- out of oyster shells.
- And you guys, unfortunately,

38:24.302 --> 38:25.738
Now you're talking, but......because you didn't,

38:25.781 --> 38:27.870
I'm so sorry,
but I'm out.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.265
- Well, we appreciate it, Lori.
- Thank you for your time, Lori.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.572
Look, I think you've come
with a great product,

38:33.615 --> 38:35.661
a really, really good idea.

38:35.704 --> 38:38.054
There's two things
I don't like about it.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.969
One is clearly the valuation.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.884
And the second thing,
interestingly,

38:41.928 --> 38:44.017
is you haven't given any share
to your sister,

38:44.060 --> 38:45.671
who I think is
just about as passionate

38:45.714 --> 38:47.412
in this business as you are.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.718
So can you answer
why that hasn't happened?

38:49.762 --> 38:53.374
Honestly, Peter, we haven't
even thought about it yet.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.333
Lauren's put in
the time.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.682
Did you think about, Lauren?

38:56.725 --> 38:58.074
You might want to ask
Lauren that, yeah.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.294
Lauren, would you take it
if he offered you equity?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.643
Yeah, absolutely.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.253
Michael, are you going to
offer her some equity?

39:03.297 --> 39:04.603
Yes.

39:04.646 --> 39:05.952
How much
is she gonna get?

39:07.388 --> 39:08.737
I'd like to see
Michael's commitment.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.304
How much
would you give her now?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.436
Hmm.

39:11.479 --> 39:12.915
Lauren, what do you want?

39:12.959 --> 39:13.916
I'll take 10%.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.700
That's it?

39:14.743 --> 39:15.831
Done.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.267
Alright!
We got a deal finally.

39:17.311 --> 39:18.965
Great, you've just done a deal
in the Shark Tank.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.619
- Congratulations.
- We'll take it.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.838
You might do another one 'cause
I'm gonna make you an offer.

39:22.882 --> 39:25.058
Awesome.
Let's hear it.

39:25.101 --> 39:28.278
I am able
to help you sell this

39:28.322 --> 39:31.804
on a global basis
in multiple markets.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.936
I've got a business --
I'm a major shareholder.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.416
It's called Localised.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.766
We take even American brands,

39:37.810 --> 39:39.942
and we put them
into global markets.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.248
I'm going to offer you
all of the money --

39:41.291 --> 39:44.512
that's $375,000 --

39:44.556 --> 39:46.949
but I want 45%
- of the business.
- Ooh!

39:46.993 --> 39:48.124
- O'- Yowza!
- - Wow.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.387
Wow!

39:59.309 --> 40:00.572
Four Sharks are out.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.748
Peter is interested
in Lauren and Mike's

40:02.791 --> 40:05.272
recycled-oyster sweater company,
Long Wharf,

40:05.315 --> 40:06.708
but he wants a much bigger bite

40:06.752 --> 40:09.015
than the 15%
they came in offering.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.320
I'm going to offer you
all of the money --

40:10.364 --> 40:11.887
that's $375,000 --

40:11.931 --> 40:14.586
but I want 45%
- of the business.
- Ooh!

40:14.629 --> 40:15.369
- O'- Yowza!
- - Wow.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.370
Wow!

40:16.414 --> 40:17.719
The British are coming!

40:17.763 --> 40:20.156
Yeah. No...

40:20.200 --> 40:22.202
That they are.
Um...

40:22.245 --> 40:23.769
I think that's
a hell of an offer

40:23.812 --> 40:25.901
because you don't
have anything yet.

40:25.945 --> 40:27.816
You got oysters,
you got some water bottles,

40:27.860 --> 40:29.165
you got nothing in sales.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.471
And you got
a new partner.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.735
You do that deal,
you lost 55% in one minute.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.521
Um...

40:36.564 --> 40:37.826
What are you thinking?

40:37.870 --> 40:40.046
Your dream for having
this business successful

40:40.089 --> 40:42.222
becomes reality
the minute you say yes.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.703
What do you
want to do?

40:49.838 --> 40:52.406
Yeah.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.453
Peter, we we'd love to have you
join the family.

40:55.496 --> 40:56.541
Great.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.412
We appreciate the offer,
but --

40:58.456 --> 41:00.240
Is that a deal?

41:00.283 --> 41:02.372
Would you consider 25%?

41:02.416 --> 41:03.199
- No.
- O'

41:04.549 --> 41:06.986
To Kevin's point, this business
today is worth

41:07.029 --> 41:08.988
maybe $300,000 to $500,000.

41:09.031 --> 41:10.511
That's the reality.

41:10.555 --> 41:14.254
And my business, we're the
only company in the world --

41:14.297 --> 41:16.517
this is a big statement,
but it's true --

41:16.561 --> 41:20.129
the only company in the world
that could take a global brand

41:20.173 --> 41:22.654
and open them up in
a localized market like Japan,

41:22.697 --> 41:26.005
Korea, and Asia
in 30 days or less.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.573
That makes a very,
very unique difference,

41:28.616 --> 41:30.096
and that's what I bring
to the party.

41:30.139 --> 41:33.752
There -- There's no
coming off of 45%?

41:33.795 --> 41:36.537
No, because I just feel
that there's gonna be
a lot of work here.

41:36.581 --> 41:40.193
I'm not gonna budge on that.
It's my final offer, so...

41:43.544 --> 41:44.763
Mm-hmm.

41:47.461 --> 41:51.204
Well, Lauren's made
the decision on this one.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.641
Peter, we really appreciate
your offer,

41:53.685 --> 41:55.600
but it's more than we're willing
to give up right now.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.689
Whoa!
Good for you guys.

41:57.732 --> 41:59.168
- Understandable.
- O'Are you kidding?

41:59.212 --> 42:00.605
No, that's smart as hell.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.737
We really appreciate everyone's
advice and time today.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.173
Good luck.

42:04.217 --> 42:06.262
Well, listen, Peter just got you
10% of the company.

42:06.306 --> 42:07.350
- That's true.
- Right?

42:07.394 --> 42:08.613
We're walking away
as winners.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.049
You've done a deal!
Well done.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.877
Absolutely.
Thanks, guys.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.618
Thanks, everyone.
- We appreciate your time.
- Good luck, guys.

42:13.661 --> 42:14.662
Congrats, guys.
Good luck.

42:14.706 --> 42:15.924
- - Good work.
- O'- Wow.

42:18.666 --> 42:20.146
So...

42:20.189 --> 42:22.583
- Look at you!
- Got one deal done.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.194
45% was way too high.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.762
I did give up 10% today
to a great partner

42:27.806 --> 42:29.590
who's been there
since the beginning,

42:29.634 --> 42:31.331
but we're still keeping it
in the family.
