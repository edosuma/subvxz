WEBVTT

00:17.952 --> 00:18.817
(phone ringing)

00:18.819 --> 00:19.685
>> CHARLIE: Frank, pick up!

00:19.687 --> 00:20.552
Pick up, buddy, pick up, pick

00:20.554 --> 00:21.520
up, pick up, pick up, pick up!

00:21.522 --> 00:22.388
>> FRANK: Hello!

00:22.390 --> 00:23.655
>> I got a Code Red, here, pal.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.523
I got a Code Red.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.457
I just got tipped off that the

00:25.459 --> 00:26.525
health inspector's coming today!

00:26.527 --> 00:27.526
The guy's gonna be here in,

00:27.528 --> 00:28.360
like, 15 minutes.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.328
They're pulling a fast one on

00:29.330 --> 00:30.162
us!

00:30.164 --> 00:31.063
Okay, I got the place looking

00:31.065 --> 00:31.997
pretty good already, 'cause I

00:31.999 --> 00:32.898
was anticipating something like

00:32.900 --> 00:33.899
this, but do me a favor.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.200
Make sure no one is in the bar

00:35.202 --> 00:36.035
today, okay?

00:36.037 --> 00:37.169
I cannot have those guys in here

00:37.171 --> 00:38.871
making a mess, you got it?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.906
(chickens clucking)

00:43.144 --> 00:45.577
Oh, shit.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.437
(chickens clucking)

01:11.439 --> 01:12.371
>> What the hell is this?

01:12.373 --> 01:13.172
Why are there chickens

01:13.174 --> 01:13.939
everywhere?

01:13.940 --> 01:14.705
>> DENNIS: No time to explain it

01:14.708 --> 01:15.574
to you, you wouldn't get it

01:15.576 --> 01:16.208
anyway.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.109
>> What are you painting?

01:17.111 --> 01:17.843
>> It's a new sign.

01:17.845 --> 01:18.777
Okay? Look.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.279
"Carmine's: A Place for Steaks."

01:20.281 --> 01:21.246
>> What? No, I can't have you

01:21.248 --> 01:22.581
put that sign up.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.615
The health inspector's coming,

01:23.617 --> 01:24.283
like, any minute!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.017
>> So what?

01:25.019 --> 01:25.884
>> So what? So we're not

01:25.886 --> 01:26.719
Carmine's.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.553
Look, I can't have them see the

01:27.555 --> 01:28.120
sign.

01:28.122 --> 01:28.854
(chicken clucking)

01:28.856 --> 01:29.621
>> MAC: Who gives a shit?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.589
We always get a passing grade.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.623
>> Yeah, we get a passing grade

01:31.625 --> 01:32.858
because I bust my ass to make

01:32.860 --> 01:34.460
sure that happens, okay?

01:34.462 --> 01:35.561
And we don't pretend that we're

01:35.563 --> 01:36.361
a restaurant!

01:36.363 --> 01:37.229
Look, this is (bleep) crazy!

01:37.231 --> 01:37.997
No sign!

01:37.998 --> 01:38.764
>> No, we're using the sign,

01:38.766 --> 01:39.865
because the sign's a big part of

01:39.867 --> 01:40.632
the plan.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.467
>> What is the plan?

01:41.469 --> 01:42.201
What is happening?

01:42.203 --> 01:43.102
>> Charlie, we found a loophole

01:43.104 --> 01:43.869
in the system.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.635
>> DEE: Yeah, it's a closing

01:44.638 --> 01:45.571
loophole; it involves airline

01:45.573 --> 01:46.355
miles and points.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.138
>> You're doing a chicken and

01:47.141 --> 01:48.240
airline miles scam today?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.274
>> Look, it is a great plan,

01:49.276 --> 01:50.209
okay?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.243
We do not have a ton of time to

01:51.245 --> 01:52.244
explain it to you, we're busy...

01:52.246 --> 01:53.212
>> Okay, fine, whatever, I get

01:53.214 --> 01:53.979
it, I get it.

01:53.981 --> 01:54.980
>> No, you don't.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.081
>> It's a good plan, Charlie.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.116
>> Frank, Jesus Christ, man,

01:57.118 --> 01:57.916
where are your shoes?

01:57.918 --> 01:58.951
>> I lost 'em in the bathroom.

01:58.953 --> 01:59.885
>> All right, goddamn it.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.719
I gotta think here.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.753
Okay, here's what we're gonna

02:01.755 --> 02:02.521
do.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.288
We gotta get all these chickens

02:03.290 --> 02:04.123
and coops and feathers and

02:04.125 --> 02:05.057
everything in the back office.

02:05.059 --> 02:05.824
Now! Go!

02:05.826 --> 02:06.725
>> Why the hell would we do

02:06.727 --> 02:07.509
that?

02:07.510 --> 02:08.292
>> Well, I assume you don't want

02:08.295 --> 02:09.128
a health inspector seeing

02:09.130 --> 02:10.295
anything about a chicken "scam"

02:10.297 --> 02:11.663
you're trying to pull off.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.631
>> That's a good point.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.432
>> All right, yeah, fine.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.333
But don't pretend like you

02:14.335 --> 02:15.267
understand the plan, 'cause

02:15.269 --> 02:16.101
that's gonna piss me off.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.169
>> Okay. Dee, get the joke stool

02:17.171 --> 02:18.003
in the basement, all right?

02:18.005 --> 02:18.670
Can't have it out.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.938
>> What? No way.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.839
It's hilarious.

02:20.841 --> 02:21.940
>> It's not hilarious, it's just

02:21.942 --> 02:22.908
a stool with a nail sticking out

02:22.910 --> 02:23.692
of it.

02:23.693 --> 02:24.475
>> Yeah, and when it pokes their

02:24.478 --> 02:25.410
butts, they scream, 'cause they

02:25.412 --> 02:26.311
just got a nail right in the

02:26.313 --> 02:27.079
butt.

02:27.081 --> 02:27.913
I... you don't understand

02:27.915 --> 02:28.714
comedy at all.

02:28.715 --> 02:29.514
>> You don't understand comedy.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.449
That's not a joke, it's a

02:30.451 --> 02:31.217
lawsuit.

02:31.218 --> 02:31.984
Just put it in the basement.

02:31.986 --> 02:32.818
>> Fine, all right, fine.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.685
>> Can't have the guy sitting

02:33.687 --> 02:34.375
on that...

02:34.376 --> 02:35.064
>> Okay! Relax!

02:35.065 --> 02:35.753
>> All right, Frank, let's go.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.588
Bathroom! Come on!

02:36.590 --> 02:37.356
I gotta find your shoes!

02:37.358 --> 02:38.190
>> All right, all right...

02:38.192 --> 02:39.091
>> Let's go, let's go.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.025
And then help with the chickens

02:40.027 --> 02:40.759
if you can, please.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.493
Move, move, move, move.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.461
How could you have possibly lost

02:42.463 --> 02:43.929
your shoes in...

02:43.931 --> 02:45.464
Oh, my God. No!

02:45.466 --> 02:46.765
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

02:46.767 --> 02:47.699
What's wrong with the toilet?

02:47.701 --> 02:48.534
>> Looks clogged.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.434
>> What the hell?

02:49.436 --> 02:50.335
I just had these all in, like,

02:50.337 --> 02:51.203
perfect working condition.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.171
>> Must be my shoes.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.038
>> Your shoes?

02:53.040 --> 02:53.872
What are you talking about?

02:53.874 --> 02:54.840
>> Well, when I said I lost my

02:54.842 --> 02:55.807
shoes, I didn't mean I didn't

02:55.809 --> 02:56.842
know where they were.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.443
It's just that they were gone.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.378
>> You flushed your shoes down

02:59.380 --> 03:00.145
the toilet?

03:00.147 --> 03:01.046
Why would you do that?

03:01.048 --> 03:01.947
>> It's an anxiety thing,

03:01.949 --> 03:02.781
Charlie.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.982
Everybody's moving so fast all

03:03.984 --> 03:05.017
of a sudden, it freaks me out.

03:05.019 --> 03:05.951
Flushing things gives me

03:05.953 --> 03:06.552
control.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.519
It's a thing.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.353
>> That's not a thing.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.188
>> It's a thing.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.022
>> That's not a thing.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.056
I've never heard of that thing.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.391
All right, I gotta dig 'em out.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.692
>> Want me to get a snake tool?

03:13.694 --> 03:14.626
>> No, I'm just gonna...

03:14.628 --> 03:15.494
Look, just go help with the

03:15.496 --> 03:16.295
chickens, okay?

03:16.297 --> 03:17.296
Help with the chickens, please?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.297
Get 'em in the back office, do

03:18.299 --> 03:19.198
whatever you can!

03:19.200 --> 03:20.199
>> Charlie, I need you for

03:20.201 --> 03:21.033
something.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.401
>> Goddamn, this thing's broken.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.502
Look, can you give me that fix

03:23.504 --> 03:24.403
bag right there?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.304
>> Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.139
Hey, listen, um... we've got a

03:27.141 --> 03:28.173
huge problem out there, dude.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.041
>> Oh.

03:29.043 --> 03:29.975
>> Earlier, when Dennis said,

03:29.977 --> 03:31.677
"We've got a really good idea

03:31.679 --> 03:33.145
with this plan," that wasn't

03:33.147 --> 03:34.646
entirely accurate, 'cause it was

03:34.648 --> 03:36.582
actually<i> my</i> idea and I think the

03:36.584 --> 03:38.050
usage of the word "we" in there

03:38.052 --> 03:39.084
is really confusing, because,

03:39.086 --> 03:40.252
like, how can a whole group of

03:40.254 --> 03:41.386
people have the same idea at the

03:41.388 --> 03:42.321
same time?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.322
What, do they just say it all at

03:43.324 --> 03:44.356
once? It's ludicrous.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.524
>> I don't understand why you're

03:45.526 --> 03:46.425
angling for credit right now.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.259
We'll go through the normal

03:47.261 --> 03:48.227
arbitration process at the end

03:48.229 --> 03:48.994
of all of this.

03:48.995 --> 03:49.760
>> Right. Well, I've just been

03:49.763 --> 03:50.562
screwed at the last three

03:50.564 --> 03:51.897
arbitration processes, and I

03:51.899 --> 03:53.832
just want you to be on my side,

03:53.834 --> 03:54.700
you know?

03:54.702 --> 03:55.534
'Cause I really need you.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.835
>> Whatever, dude. I don't care.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.103
Wait.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.037
What happened to the glory hole

03:59.039 --> 03:59.871
cover?

03:59.873 --> 04:00.672
>> I took it off.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.607
I-I thought you... you put it on

04:01.609 --> 04:02.708
there by accident.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.709
>> No, I put it up there because

04:03.711 --> 04:04.509
I don't want the health

04:04.511 --> 04:05.444
inspector seeing that we have a

04:05.446 --> 04:06.612
place for a person to get their

04:06.614 --> 04:07.546
dick sucked by a stranger.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.614
>> Dude, you are taking this

04:08.616 --> 04:10.048
whole inspection thing way too

04:10.050 --> 04:11.250
seriously, okay?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.384
Back to the credit issue-- you

04:12.386 --> 04:13.518
just don't know what it's like

04:13.520 --> 04:14.353
to be overlooked.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.254
>> Oh, my God, that's exactly

04:15.256 --> 04:16.221
what's happening to me right

04:16.223 --> 04:17.089
now.

04:17.091 --> 04:17.923
>> Okay. You know what?

04:17.925 --> 04:18.724
Maybe I'll just casually bring

04:18.725 --> 04:19.524
it up to him and then he won't

04:19.526 --> 04:20.225
even know what we're

04:20.227 --> 04:20.926
talking about.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.060
>> Ha! I got a fix!

04:22.062 --> 04:23.095
I got a fix right here-- all

04:23.097 --> 04:24.062
right, we'll just put this up

04:24.064 --> 04:26.064
and boom, that's pretty good.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.199
What was that?

04:27.201 --> 04:28.567
Why did the lights go out?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.801
>> Uh, that could be the vacuum

04:29.803 --> 04:30.636
sealer.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.603
That thing probably pulls a lot

04:31.605 --> 04:32.371
of power.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.872
>> Vacuum sealer? What the hell?

04:33.874 --> 04:34.706
>> Yeah.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.574
>> All right, where's this

04:35.576 --> 04:36.408
packaging machine thing?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.242
>> Keg room.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.076
>> Keg room?

04:38.078 --> 04:38.977
Okay, good, they're back on.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.911
Frank, Frank, Frank, don't go

04:39.913 --> 04:40.701
away!

04:40.702 --> 04:41.490
Okay, keep moving chickens, yes,

04:41.491 --> 04:42.279
but I need you to take the "Talk

04:42.283 --> 04:43.048
American" sign down.

04:43.050 --> 04:43.915
>> Are you sure?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.117
Maybe he's a racist, too.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.251
>> The health inspector's not a

04:46.253 --> 04:47.119
racist, Frank.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.253
Take it down, please, okay?

04:48.255 --> 04:49.288
And shoes-- shoes, please?

04:49.290 --> 04:50.455
Find some shoes?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.590
>> I got this.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.557
>> Oh, shit!

04:52.559 --> 04:53.425
This thing's tits!

04:53.427 --> 04:54.426
>> No, no, no, you can't use

04:54.428 --> 04:55.227
this machine, okay?

04:55.229 --> 04:56.295
It blew the surge protector.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.329
>> Well, we can't do the plan

04:57.331 --> 04:58.297
without the packaging machine.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.164
How else are we supposed to

04:59.166 --> 04:59.931
vacuum-seal the steaks?

04:59.933 --> 05:00.766
>> Steaks?

05:00.768 --> 05:02.067
This is a chicken and air mile

05:02.069 --> 05:02.901
and steak scam, now?

05:02.903 --> 05:03.835
>> Yeah.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.770
>> All right, fine.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.671
I can work with it, I can work

05:05.673 --> 05:06.338
with it.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.139
Just do me a favor, start

05:07.141 --> 05:08.073
packaging lemons and limes and

05:08.075 --> 05:08.940
things, make it seem like we

05:08.942 --> 05:09.775
package shit at the bar.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.575
>> Fun.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.476
>> Dee, I need you down in the

05:11.478 --> 05:12.344
basement, I need your reach.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.078
>> Me?

05:13.079 --> 05:13.811
>> Yeah, real quick, come on.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.646
>> Okay.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.249
>> Hey, Dennis.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.250
Could I talk to you for

05:18.252 --> 05:20.919
a second?

05:20.921 --> 05:21.953
>> Do me a favor.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.788
I got a battery here.

05:22.790 --> 05:23.755
Reach up in the carbon monoxide

05:23.757 --> 05:24.623
detector, just pop it in real

05:24.625 --> 05:25.357
quick?

05:25.359 --> 05:26.191
>> Yeah, you got it.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.192
Hey, Charlie, while we're down

05:27.194 --> 05:28.126
here, I just wanted to talk to

05:28.128 --> 05:28.927
you about ideas...

05:28.929 --> 05:29.761
(detector beeping)

05:29.763 --> 05:30.696
...and how funny it is that they

05:30.698 --> 05:31.596
can come from all kinds of

05:31.598 --> 05:32.431
different places, you know?

05:32.433 --> 05:33.298
(detector continues beeping)

05:33.300 --> 05:34.199
Somebody could say something

05:34.201 --> 05:34.866
really funny and it might spark

05:34.868 --> 05:35.400
an idea...

05:35.401 --> 05:35.933
>> Shh, shh, shh-- Dee, zip up

05:35.936 --> 05:36.685
the mouth...

05:36.686 --> 05:37.435
>> No, I know, but before the

05:37.438 --> 05:38.370
arbitration, I need to know...

05:38.372 --> 05:39.171
>> Dee, shut up, shut up,

05:39.173 --> 05:39.855
shut up!

05:39.856 --> 05:40.538
That's, uh, G-sharp.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.373
Okay, I got it, I got it.

05:41.375 --> 05:41.973
Yeah, yeah.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.607
>> Is it broken?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.508
It won't shut the hell up.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.476
>> No, it's doing exactly what

05:44.478 --> 05:45.544
it's supposed to do and that's

05:45.546 --> 05:46.345
the problem.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.145
There's, like, a ton of carbon

05:47.147 --> 05:48.180
monoxide down here, so I don't

05:48.182 --> 05:48.880
want it doing that.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.681
>> What? Why?

05:49.682 --> 05:50.481
>> Uh, well, I... actually, what

05:50.484 --> 05:51.850
I do is I block the vents to the

05:51.852 --> 05:53.151
furnace and that fills the

05:53.153 --> 05:54.553
basement with dangerous gases.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.454
Drives the rodents away.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.388
I always do it leading up to an

05:56.390 --> 05:57.155
inspection.

05:57.157 --> 05:57.989
>> Is that safe?

05:57.991 --> 05:58.857
>> No, no.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.691
It's incredibly unsafe.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.692
We can't be down here too long,

06:00.694 --> 06:01.560
so get the battery and we

06:01.562 --> 06:02.160
gotta roll.

06:02.162 --> 06:02.794
>> Oh, my God.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.495
>> Yeah, get it out.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.363
And then just make it look

06:04.365 --> 06:05.047
like...

06:05.048 --> 06:05.730
>> Goddamn you, Charlie.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.365
Goddamn it, go.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.199
>> All right, go, go, go.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.033
You getting light-headed?

06:08.035 --> 06:08.867
>> Yes!

06:08.869 --> 06:10.535
(Mac screams in distance)

06:10.537 --> 06:11.737
>> Why'd I hear a squeal?

06:11.739 --> 06:12.571
Oh, no, dude, why are you

06:12.573 --> 06:13.538
bleeding?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.806
>> Dennis scratched me.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.907
>> Mac was doing that thing

06:15.909 --> 06:17.209
where he tries to casually bring

06:17.211 --> 06:18.543
something up to me, like I don't

06:18.545 --> 06:19.511
notice.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.412
Come to me like a man!

06:20.414 --> 06:21.380
Talk about being tough all the

06:21.382 --> 06:22.347
time; can't even look me in the

06:22.349 --> 06:22.914
eyes.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.548
>> Okay.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.383
>> How's this for shoes,

06:24.385 --> 06:25.184
Charlie?

06:25.185 --> 06:25.984
>> Aw, no, Frank, come on, man!

06:25.986 --> 06:26.918
You're gonna get black paint

06:26.920 --> 06:27.753
everywhere!

06:27.755 --> 06:28.754
>> I changed my mind about the

06:28.756 --> 06:29.654
stool.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.589
>> No, no stool. Stool's out.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.423
No way!

06:31.425 --> 06:32.357
>> It's just that it was my

06:32.359 --> 06:33.158
idea, Dennis.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.092
It's sort of like the jean

06:34.094 --> 06:35.060
shorts, you know, where you...

06:35.062 --> 06:35.894
>> Look at me when you're

06:35.896 --> 06:37.195
talking to me!

06:37.197 --> 06:38.730
(truck horn honks outside)

06:38.732 --> 06:39.531
Oh, shit.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.565
The steaks are here.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.767
Nice.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.402
(brakes hiss, engine shuts off)

06:43.404 --> 06:44.903
>> Whoa.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.104
That's a big truck.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.072
>> Shit. No, no, no, no, no.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.006
I can't have this truck out

06:48.008 --> 06:48.840
here!

06:48.842 --> 06:49.775
>> Hey, uh, is this Carmine's

06:49.777 --> 06:50.593
Steak House?

06:50.594 --> 06:51.410
>> You're looking at the sign,

06:51.412 --> 06:53.078
pal.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.346
>> Oh.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.213
Hey, you guys mind if I get a

06:55.215 --> 06:56.748
quick bite here before we begin?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.250
>> You want to eat here?

06:58.252 --> 06:59.284
>> Uh, yeah, you know, it's a

06:59.286 --> 07:00.585
long drive back to Ohio and I

07:00.587 --> 07:01.453
figured I was gonna be here a

07:01.455 --> 07:02.354
while, unloading all these

07:02.356 --> 07:03.121
steaks.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.122
>> Well, you won't be here that

07:04.124 --> 07:05.090
long, right?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.391
I mean, it's only 400 steaks.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.626
>> Four hundred?

07:07.628 --> 07:08.894
You ordered 4,000.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.928
>> Excuse me, I gotta use the

07:09.930 --> 07:11.763
toilet.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.898
>> Oh, shit.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.765
>> Oh, gosh, you know what?

07:13.767 --> 07:14.733
The thing is, our kitchen's not

07:14.735 --> 07:15.567
open...

07:15.569 --> 07:16.468
>> Okay, you know what? Yeah.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.536
Go ahead, uh, leave the keys in

07:17.538 --> 07:18.637
it, maybe pop the back, we'll

07:18.639 --> 07:19.571
help you get started.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.539
I'm gonna fire up the grill and

07:20.541 --> 07:21.907
all set.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.774
>> Okay.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.443
>> We got you covered. (laughs)

07:24.445 --> 07:25.210
(toilet flushing)

07:25.212 --> 07:25.977
Oh, son of a bitch.

07:25.979 --> 07:26.878
Did you flush your shirt?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.663
>> Yep.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.447
>> Okay, uh, I don't want to

07:28.449 --> 07:29.381
interrupt here, Charlie, but we

07:29.383 --> 07:30.215
got a major problem on our

07:30.217 --> 07:31.049
hands.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.083
A) We are not a restaurant that

07:32.085 --> 07:33.485
serves food, and B) How are we

07:33.487 --> 07:34.886
gonna package 4,000 steaks?

07:34.888 --> 07:35.821
>> We can handle it, okay?

07:35.823 --> 07:36.822
>> Dee, we should've never done

07:36.824 --> 07:37.656
your stupid plan!

07:37.658 --> 07:38.457
>> My plan?

07:38.459 --> 07:39.458
No way, this was Frank's idea.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.625
>> Wasn't my idea.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.660
Dennis was all over it.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.727
>> Me? No, this was Mac's stupid

07:42.729 --> 07:43.562
plan.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.463
>> Then why'd you scratch me?

07:44.465 --> 07:45.430
>> 'Cause I was irritated with

07:45.432 --> 07:46.198
you.

07:46.199 --> 07:46.965
>> Look, we can handle all of

07:46.967 --> 07:47.599
this, all right?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.433
>> Excuse me, with all due

07:48.435 --> 07:49.401
respect, Charlie, you don't even

07:49.403 --> 07:50.335
know what the goddamn plan is.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.236
>> Okay, okay, with all due

07:51.238 --> 07:52.003
respect to you, I think I

07:52.005 --> 07:53.305
understand it fully, okay?

07:53.307 --> 07:54.272
You guys used Frank's credit

07:54.274 --> 07:55.106
card, you bought a bunch of

07:55.108 --> 07:56.241
airline miles.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.175
You used those airline miles to

07:57.177 --> 07:58.577
purchase 400 steaks.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.444
Knowing that this delivery

07:59.446 --> 08:00.745
company delivered all variety of

08:00.747 --> 08:02.247
animal products, your plan was

08:02.249 --> 08:03.148
to contaminate the steaks with

08:03.150 --> 08:04.316
chicken feathers, by rubbing

08:04.318 --> 08:05.417
live chickens all over them.

08:05.419 --> 08:06.418
Then you were gonna repackage

08:06.420 --> 08:07.586
the steaks, at which point,

08:07.588 --> 08:08.353
you were gonna return the

08:08.355 --> 08:09.621
contaminated steaks for actual

08:09.623 --> 08:11.189
cash, taking advantage of a

08:11.191 --> 08:12.157
loophole in the current airline

08:12.159 --> 08:13.325
miles system, correct?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.860
>> Very good, Charlie.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.027
>> That is it, that is it.

08:16.029 --> 08:16.995
>> That was the plan, but I

08:16.997 --> 08:17.996
mean... you know, we basically

08:17.998 --> 08:19.030
had already explained it to you,

08:19.032 --> 08:19.865
so...

08:19.867 --> 08:20.665
>> Right.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.700
But what you didn't plan for was

08:21.702 --> 08:22.601
a hungry delivery guy who'd

08:22.603 --> 08:23.502
driven here all the way from

08:23.504 --> 08:24.303
Ohio.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.103
Or that Dee's oversized fingers

08:25.105 --> 08:26.037
could've accidentally pressed

08:26.039 --> 08:26.938
"zero" again when she ordered

08:26.940 --> 08:27.706
the steaks online.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.773
I'm assuming you did the typing,

08:28.775 --> 08:29.608
Dee, yes?

08:29.610 --> 08:30.609
>> Goddamn it.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.476
>> Dee, you bitch.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.444
>> But none of this matters to

08:32.446 --> 08:33.345
me, okay?

08:33.347 --> 08:34.513
Because today is inspection day.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.947
A day that I pride myself on, a

08:35.949 --> 08:36.982
day that I've never failed on,

08:36.984 --> 08:37.849
and I don't plan to begin

08:37.851 --> 08:38.850
failing now, so listen to me and

08:38.852 --> 08:39.784
listen close, like you've never

08:39.786 --> 08:40.685
done before.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.053
We are going to pull this thing

08:42.055 --> 08:45.156
off, so help me God.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.192
Son of a bitch.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.731
>> Okay, here we go.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.665
Here's the plan:

08:53.667 --> 08:54.900
Dee, Frank, come with me.

08:54.902 --> 08:55.967
I want you guys to set up a

08:55.969 --> 08:56.968
table and chair in the alleyway,

08:56.970 --> 08:57.836
all right?

08:57.838 --> 08:58.803
This guy's gonna be dining in

08:58.805 --> 08:59.638
our patio area.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.672
Dee, take his order, make him

09:00.674 --> 09:01.640
think it's a real restaurant.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.674
Frank, as soon as you're done,

09:02.676 --> 09:03.808
haul ass down the alleyway, move

09:03.810 --> 09:05.010
the guy's truck, all right?

09:05.012 --> 09:05.911
All right, I need you guys to

09:05.913 --> 09:06.978
take down the Carmine sign.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.879
I can't have it up when the

09:07.881 --> 09:08.813
inspector gets here, all right?

09:08.815 --> 09:09.648
And get me a steak off the

09:09.650 --> 09:10.415
truck, okay?

09:10.417 --> 09:11.082
>> Gladly.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.017
>> All right, I'm gonna show

09:12.019 --> 09:12.884
this guy to his table.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.718
Here we go.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.553
Oh, hey, right on time!

09:14.555 --> 09:15.487
Here's my guy. You know what?

09:15.489 --> 09:16.421
Don't even bother unloading,

09:16.423 --> 09:17.422
'cause I'm gonna have my guys

09:17.424 --> 09:18.156
handle it, okay?

09:18.158 --> 09:18.690
>> You sure?

09:18.692 --> 09:19.357
>> Oh, absolutely.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.191
The keys are in the truck,

09:20.193 --> 09:20.825
right?

09:20.827 --> 09:21.560
>> Yeah, they're...

09:21.562 --> 09:22.360
>> All right, come on in.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.261
Let's go have a bite to eat.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.195
I know you're a hungry guy.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.196
>> Oh, it's-it's a nice spot.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.064
>> Yeah, it's a nice spot.

09:26.066 --> 09:26.831
We can't complain.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.716
We can't complain.

09:27.717 --> 09:28.600
See all these booths over here?

09:28.602 --> 09:29.568
They're nice.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.602
And we got a patio area.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.503
I think you're gonna enjoy

09:31.505 --> 09:32.370
sitting there.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.038
>> You know what?

09:33.040 --> 09:33.772
A booth is-is fine.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.773
>> Oh, no, see, look, we got

09:34.775 --> 09:36.675
these old stools and old booths,

09:36.677 --> 09:37.609
but the patio area is really

09:37.611 --> 09:38.877
something special.

09:38.879 --> 09:39.778
You know, you're a top-shelf

09:39.780 --> 09:40.679
customer, right?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.446
>> Right.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.212
>> You want to be having the

09:42.215 --> 09:43.281
top-shelf experience.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.115
And here we go.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.250
>> Welcome!

09:45.252 --> 09:46.084
Please, make yourself

09:46.086 --> 09:47.519
comfortable.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.920
>> Yeah, have a seat and, uh,

09:48.922 --> 09:51.189
enjoy the patio.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.557
>> Uh, this is an alley.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.459
I think I'd rather just sit

09:54.461 --> 09:55.260
inside.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.094
(Charlie laughs)

09:56.096 --> 09:57.062
>> Spends all day in a truck and

09:57.064 --> 09:58.463
he wants to eat indoors!

09:58.465 --> 09:59.698
Hey, the man needs fresh air!

09:59.700 --> 10:00.632
Dee, take his order, okay?

10:00.634 --> 10:01.600
>> Yes, yes.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.634
Uh, what can I get you?

10:02.636 --> 10:03.535
>> Okay, here we go.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.537
Okay, here we go.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.573
Okay.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.574
Here we go.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.208
(panting)

10:10.210 --> 10:11.977
Mac! Steaks! Steaks!

10:11.979 --> 10:13.144
All right, back on this!

10:13.146 --> 10:14.245
Dennis, I need you to be the

10:14.247 --> 10:15.246
face in the bar, okay?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.581
>> I accept that responsibility.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.549
>> Frank, go, go, go!

10:17.551 --> 10:18.550
Okay, here's my guy, right

10:18.552 --> 10:19.551
on time.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.920
Come on, now, buddy, here we go.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.288
Wait-- wait, wait, whoa, whoa,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.889
whoa-- who's this?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.157
No, no, no, ma'am, ma'am, I'm

10:26.159 --> 10:27.559
sorry, you can't park here.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.994
>> Are you the owner?

10:28.996 --> 10:29.995
>> Uh, yeah, Charlie Kelly.

10:29.997 --> 10:30.996
Who's asking?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.163
>> I'm, uh, Sandy Lawler.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.231
I'm with the City Board of

10:33.233 --> 10:34.232
Health.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.433
I'll be conducting an impromptu

10:35.435 --> 10:36.768
inspection of your bar.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.802
>> Okay, yeah, uh, what happened

10:37.804 --> 10:38.803
to Alan?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.071
>> Alan was let go on account of

10:40.073 --> 10:41.406
his leniency.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.340
Shall we begin?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.975
>> Okay. Uh... sure.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.343
All right, let's get going.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.411
Right in here.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.445
This is our, uh, bartender over

10:47.447 --> 10:48.413
here.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.414
>> All right, all right,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.415
all right.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.416
>> Okay. He's a bit of a

10:51.418 --> 10:52.217
character.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.017
Where would you like to begin?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.019
>> Let's, uh, begin with the

10:54.021 --> 10:55.086
bathrooms.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.321
>> Okay, that's fine.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.622
Come on in this way.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.124
>> I assume all the toilets are

10:59.126 --> 11:00.091
in working order.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.092
>> Oh, absolutely.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.160
Yeah, I wouldn't bother checking

11:02.162 --> 11:03.028
if I were you.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.863
>> I think I will.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.331
You're standing awfully close

11:06.333 --> 11:07.332
to me.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.366
>> (exhales) Sorry about that.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.367
Yeah.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.835
>> Do I smell cheese?

11:10.837 --> 11:11.803
>> I'm gonna leave you to it.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.539
You do your thing, okay?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.707
Dennis, heads up.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.708
>> What are these?

11:16.710 --> 11:17.776
>> They're car keys, okay?

11:17.778 --> 11:18.777
Just picked her pocket.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.644
Go move her car, so Frank can

11:19.646 --> 11:20.311
pull the truck up.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.001
>> Okay, okay.

11:21.002 --> 11:21.690
>> Hey, Dee, hold up.

11:21.691 --> 11:22.379
Okay, put this on the furnace,

11:22.382 --> 11:23.348
all right? Cook it up good.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.382
>> Oh, no, he wants a turkey

11:24.384 --> 11:25.016
burger.

11:25.018 --> 11:25.617
>> What? Why?

11:25.619 --> 11:26.217
>> I don't know.

11:26.219 --> 11:26.985
I offered it to him.

11:26.987 --> 11:27.786
>> Why would you do that?

11:27.788 --> 11:28.787
>> You said pretend we're a

11:28.789 --> 11:29.721
restaurant-- he looked like a

11:29.723 --> 11:30.555
turkey burger kind of guy.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.523
>> He looks like a turkey burger

11:31.525 --> 11:32.557
kind of guy?! Oh, my God, Dee,

11:32.559 --> 11:33.558
just put it on the furnace,

11:33.560 --> 11:34.192
okay, cook it up.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.160
Tell him you got the order

11:35.162 --> 11:36.161
wrong, just tell him you got the

11:36.163 --> 11:37.095
thing wrong.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.028
Oh, my God, what a stupid bitch.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.230
What a stupid bitch she is.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.332
Okay.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.401
(grunts)

11:45.539 --> 11:46.538
>> Dude, what's the plan with

11:46.540 --> 11:47.339
the chickens?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.139
>> Okay, everything's going in

11:48.141 --> 11:48.840
the vent, all right?

11:48.842 --> 11:49.808
Chickens, cages, they're all

11:49.810 --> 11:50.642
going in the vent.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.475
But first, count to, like, 30,

11:51.478 --> 11:52.477
and then start moaning into it.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.261
>> Why?

11:53.262 --> 11:54.044
>> Dude, just do it, okay?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.046
Don't ask questions, just moan

11:55.048 --> 11:56.081
in the vent; after a couple of

11:56.083 --> 11:56.981
moans say, "I'm sorry."

11:56.983 --> 11:57.916
You got it?

11:57.918 --> 11:58.883
>> Okay, sure, yeah.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.085
>> Okay? Okay?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.187
>> 26, 25...

12:02.189 --> 12:06.024
>> 24, 23, 22, 21, 20...

12:06.026 --> 12:08.827
(grunts) 19, 18, 17,

12:08.829 --> 12:12.330
(quietly): 16, 15, 14, 13,

12:12.332 --> 12:15.700
12, 11, ten, nine...

12:15.702 --> 12:18.937
And how are we looking in here?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.505
>> It's acceptable so far.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.106
>> Okay.

12:21.108 --> 12:21.773
>> (moaning)

12:21.775 --> 12:22.540
>> Oh, you hear that?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.541
>> Oh, I guess there's somebody

12:23.543 --> 12:24.175
in there.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.076
>> It sounds like there's

12:25.078 --> 12:26.111
somebody in there, yeah.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.679
Let's take a little peek.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.380
Hey, buddy, how about a courtesy

12:29.382 --> 12:30.548
cough or something next time?

12:30.550 --> 12:31.716
>> I'm sorry.

12:31.718 --> 12:32.884
>> Don't be sorry, you know?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.352
Just, uh, give us all a heads-up

12:34.354 --> 12:35.286
you're in here, save us all the

12:35.288 --> 12:36.187
embarrassment, you know?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.122
Some people, they got, like, no

12:37.124 --> 12:38.189
sort of social boundaries or

12:38.191 --> 12:38.990
anything like that.

12:38.991 --> 12:39.790
It's really kind of an awkward

12:39.793 --> 12:40.859
thing.

12:40.861 --> 12:41.860
Did you meet our bartender?

12:41.862 --> 12:42.794
>> Hey! All right, all right,

12:42.796 --> 12:43.428
all right.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.429
>> That's right, I think I

12:44.431 --> 12:45.230
introduced you to him.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.197
You want to check out the

12:46.199 --> 12:46.865
women's bathroom?

12:46.867 --> 12:47.899
>> Yeah.

12:47.901 --> 12:48.900
>> Women's bathroom, I assure

12:48.902 --> 12:50.068
you, is spotless.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.035
>> Well, we'll see.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.270
>> No, we actually hardly ever

12:52.272 --> 12:53.271
have women in here, so...

12:53.273 --> 12:54.272
But we're not being graded on

12:54.274 --> 12:55.073
that.

12:55.074 --> 12:55.873
All right, in you go, in you go.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.875
Go ahead and take a... move your

12:56.877 --> 12:57.909
bowels if you have to.

12:57.911 --> 12:58.910
All right, okay, back office,

12:58.912 --> 12:59.694
okay?

12:59.695 --> 13:00.477
Chickens, vents-- everything's

13:00.480 --> 13:01.479
going in the vents, so get

13:01.481 --> 13:02.280
in the back. Go, go, go!

13:02.282 --> 13:03.248
>> The furnace cooked it way too

13:03.250 --> 13:04.149
fast-- it's charred to shit.

13:04.151 --> 13:04.916
>> It doesn't matter.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.617
>> It doesn't matter?

13:05.619 --> 13:06.551
I'm gonna give him the wrong

13:06.553 --> 13:07.318
order and just hand him a

13:07.320 --> 13:07.986
burned-up steak?

13:07.988 --> 13:08.720
He's gonna be pissed.

13:08.722 --> 13:09.621
>> Dee, this guy's not grading

13:09.623 --> 13:10.588
our bar-- I don't care if he has

13:10.590 --> 13:11.556
the worst dining experience of

13:11.558 --> 13:12.274
his life.

13:12.275 --> 13:12.991
Go give him the burned steak.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.058
Okay, how's this...?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.059
>> How am I gonna get all these

13:15.061 --> 13:15.760
steaks off the truck?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.795
>> You don't have to get 'em

13:16.797 --> 13:17.662
all, okay? We're just gonna

13:17.664 --> 13:18.797
contaminate a couple, then we're

13:18.799 --> 13:19.764
gonna put the chickens onto the

13:19.766 --> 13:20.431
truck.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.065
>> Why?

13:21.067 --> 13:21.766
>> Frank, we're gonna

13:21.768 --> 13:22.667
contaminate the truck, we're

13:22.669 --> 13:23.568
gonna contaminate the whole

13:23.570 --> 13:24.352
truck, all right?

13:24.353 --> 13:25.135
That goes to the keg room, and

13:25.138 --> 13:25.737
for the love of God, find a

13:25.739 --> 13:26.304
shirt!

13:26.306 --> 13:27.005
Find a shirt, Frank!

13:27.007 --> 13:28.773
All right, okay, okay.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.742
(grunts)

13:30.744 --> 13:31.676
Ah, okay.

13:31.678 --> 13:32.744
Come on, come on, come on.

13:32.746 --> 13:33.678
Okay. Nice.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.746
>> Done.

13:34.748 --> 13:35.680
>> Well done! Okay!

13:35.682 --> 13:36.681
Up top! All right, okay,

13:36.683 --> 13:37.682
here's the plan-- got to go to

13:37.684 --> 13:38.750
the third stall vents in the

13:38.752 --> 13:39.684
bathroom.

13:39.686 --> 13:40.652
Chickens are coming out there.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.619
Everything goes to the keg room,

13:41.621 --> 13:42.237
right?

13:42.238 --> 13:42.854
Start rubbing chickens on

13:42.856 --> 13:43.688
steaks, seal them up good.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.756
And then put everything on the

13:44.758 --> 13:45.523
truck-- chickens, steaks,

13:45.525 --> 13:46.524
everything on the truck!

13:46.526 --> 13:47.525
>> Got it, got it, got it.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.359
>> We're contaminating the

13:48.361 --> 13:49.194
truck, guys, let's go!

13:49.196 --> 13:49.828
What is this?

13:49.830 --> 13:50.528
What are you doing?

13:50.530 --> 13:51.596
>> I'm painting a shirt!

13:51.598 --> 13:52.430
>> No! All right, look,

13:52.432 --> 13:53.364
just, uh, get out of sight!

13:53.366 --> 13:54.365
Or go to the keg room, hide out.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.366
I'm gonna send Dee to you in a

13:55.368 --> 13:56.201
minute, all right?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.101
In fact, just keep painting,

13:57.103 --> 13:58.136
that's fine, but go in the keg

13:58.138 --> 13:59.037
room.

13:59.038 --> 13:59.937
Oh, my God, what an idiot.

13:59.940 --> 14:00.638
(arguing in distance)

14:00.640 --> 14:01.473
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.307
I'm sorry, is there a-a problem

14:02.309 --> 14:02.941
out here?

14:02.943 --> 14:03.775
>> He's making a big

14:03.777 --> 14:04.609
stink about the steak.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.543
>> The steak is burnt to shit.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.444
It's not even what I ordered.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.278
>> Would you look at that?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.279
Aw, man, I'll tell you what.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.314
I'm gonna give you a beer on the

14:09.316 --> 14:10.114
house-- come on inside.

14:10.116 --> 14:10.949
>> Oh, how nice!

14:10.951 --> 14:11.983
>> No, I'll just take it here.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.951
>> No, actually we don't have

14:12.953 --> 14:13.885
our outdoor liquor license, so I

14:13.887 --> 14:14.786
so I got to have you drink

14:14.788 --> 14:15.553
it inside. In you go!

14:15.555 --> 14:16.487
>> You know what, this is the

14:16.489 --> 14:17.288
worst restaurant I've

14:17.290 --> 14:18.056
ever been to.

14:18.058 --> 14:18.957
>> So sorry, terribly sorry,

14:18.959 --> 14:19.724
sir, terribly sorry.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.792
>> Aw, Charlie, that's not good!

14:20.794 --> 14:21.693
>> What are you talking about?

14:21.695 --> 14:22.660
It's great! Thinks we're

14:22.662 --> 14:23.661
a real restaurant.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.529
Okay, Dee, table, chairs--

14:24.531 --> 14:25.496
everything's going in the

14:25.498 --> 14:26.331
Dumpster, all right?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.365
And then please push it, like,

14:27.367 --> 14:28.333
you know, another couple inches

14:28.335 --> 14:29.334
from the door, it doesn't look

14:29.336 --> 14:30.201
like six feet to me.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.202
>> What? Of course it does.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.170
>> No, no, Dee. It looks like

14:32.172 --> 14:33.204
five and a half, okay?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.205
>> You think she's gonna notice

14:34.207 --> 14:35.206
six inches?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.174
>> You move the goddamn

14:36.176 --> 14:37.175
Dumpster, you bitch, okay?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.576
Then haul ass down the alleyway.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.378
Okay. Hi!

14:40.380 --> 14:42.080
Hi! How'd it go in there?

14:42.082 --> 14:43.548
>> Uh, fine, I suppose.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.682
Everything checks out.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.717
>> Hello.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.718
>> Hello.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.819
>> Yeah, lots of customers.

14:47.821 --> 14:48.753
We're a bustling business, so

14:48.755 --> 14:49.821
why don't you head on out to the

14:49.823 --> 14:50.755
alleyway and see if there's

14:50.757 --> 14:51.823
anything there that needs, uh,

14:51.825 --> 14:52.757
inspecting.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.758
And, ooh, sir, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:53.760 --> 14:54.759
Sorry.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.760
>> No, no, no!

14:55.762 --> 14:56.761
>> I'm gonna need you to drink

14:56.763 --> 14:57.762
that in our VIP lounge area.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.763
>> I just want to drink it here.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.831
>> Oh, come on! A very important

14:59.833 --> 15:00.865
customer like yourself sitting

15:00.867 --> 15:01.833
on a bar with the regulars?

15:01.835 --> 15:02.767
I think you're gonna enjoy the

15:02.769 --> 15:03.735
exclusivity of the lounge area,

15:03.737 --> 15:04.402
so just enjoy that.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.336
>> It's not a lounge area...

15:05.338 --> 15:05.837
>> Hey, all right, all right,

15:05.839 --> 15:06.838
all right!

15:06.840 --> 15:07.839
>> Why are you doing that to me?

15:07.841 --> 15:09.007
>> I don't know.

15:09.009 --> 15:09.908
>> Okay, I don't need you to do

15:09.910 --> 15:10.708
that to me, all right?

15:10.710 --> 15:11.609
Just go, go-- yeah, you gotta

15:11.611 --> 15:12.227
finish the job!

15:12.228 --> 15:12.844
How'd it go with the Dumpster?

15:12.846 --> 15:13.845
You move it?

15:13.847 --> 15:14.712
>> Huh? Yes.

15:14.714 --> 15:15.713
>> Okay, here's the plan.

15:15.715 --> 15:16.714
Give this to Frank.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.515
Tell him G-sharp.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.516
Then you got to paint him head

15:18.518 --> 15:19.217
to toe in black.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.451
>> Why would I do any of that?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.519
>> Dee, just do it, okay?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.520
Just do it, you goddamn bitch.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.521
Oh, you bitch!

15:23.523 --> 15:24.555
Stop questioning everything!

15:24.557 --> 15:25.556
Oh, that goddamn bitch.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.958
Oh, that goddamn bitch!

15:26.960 --> 15:27.926
Oh, my God, she's gonna ruin it

15:27.928 --> 15:28.927
all.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.728
And how are we out here?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.563
>> Everything will be in the

15:32.565 --> 15:33.531
report.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.532
>> Yeah, sure.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.533
>> Mind if I head behind the

15:35.535 --> 15:36.534
bar?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.535
>> No! Sure! That's not an

15:37.537 --> 15:38.569
issue.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.537
Yeah, come check out the bar.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.205
You know, the bar is sort of the

15:41.207 --> 15:42.707
lifeblood of a bar.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.808
(laughs)

15:43.810 --> 15:45.243
I said bar, bar twice!

15:45.245 --> 15:46.244
And, oh, you know what?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.211
There's drainage pipes down

15:47.213 --> 15:48.212
there that I don't want you to

15:48.214 --> 15:48.813
check.

15:48.815 --> 15:49.814
>> "Drainage pipes"?

15:49.816 --> 15:51.249
I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.750
I have to check it out.

15:52.752 --> 15:53.785
>> Well, if you gotta do it,

15:53.787 --> 15:54.819
you gotta do it.

15:54.821 --> 15:55.820
Now... you know, but...

15:55.822 --> 15:56.888
I mean, I know that they're a

15:56.890 --> 15:58.589
little wet, they get damp and,

15:58.591 --> 15:59.891
uh...

15:59.893 --> 16:00.892
>> Actually, they look pretty

16:00.894 --> 16:01.893
good.

16:01.895 --> 16:02.894
>> Oh, all right, well, that's

16:02.896 --> 16:03.895
great.

16:03.897 --> 16:04.896
Uh, so one last thing.

16:04.898 --> 16:05.930
I suppose I want to show the

16:05.932 --> 16:06.931
blender here, for our mixing up

16:06.933 --> 16:07.732
frozen drinks or...

16:07.734 --> 16:08.666
>> I really don't need to see

16:08.668 --> 16:09.267
that.

16:09.269 --> 16:09.968
(blender whirring)

16:09.970 --> 16:10.902
>> Turn it up higher?

16:10.904 --> 16:11.903
>> I don't really need to...

16:11.905 --> 16:12.904
>> No, that's not a good idea,

16:12.906 --> 16:13.905
but here we go... See?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.106
Yeah, we blew the power.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.674
It's not really environmentally

16:16.676 --> 16:17.976
safe to turn it up that high;

16:17.978 --> 16:19.010
that's why never really do it.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.311
I should dock you for that one.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.145
I'm not gonna.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.146
(laughs)

16:22.148 --> 16:23.147
That's a joke.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.282
I'd love to show you our

16:24.284 --> 16:25.283
packaging machine I keep in the

16:25.285 --> 16:26.250
keg room.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.585
Here, come take a peek here.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.753
Look at all this.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.921
Look at all of this!

16:29.923 --> 16:31.823
>> Oh, my! This is...

16:31.825 --> 16:32.824
>> A bit excessive?

16:32.826 --> 16:33.791
Yes, I know, but I'm a little

16:33.793 --> 16:34.792
anal when it comes to securing

16:34.794 --> 16:35.827
the perishables.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.828
You know, I just don't want

16:36.830 --> 16:37.695
anything to get rotten, and

16:37.697 --> 16:38.663
that's about as-as good

16:38.665 --> 16:39.464
as it gets.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.465
You're not the only one with

16:40.467 --> 16:41.466
standards around here.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.300
So come on down to the

16:42.302 --> 16:43.334
basement and you can check

16:43.336 --> 16:44.135
this out.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.136
Okay, so, uh, watch your step on

16:45.138 --> 16:46.204
the stairs here.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.305
Wouldn't want you to trip on any

16:47.307 --> 16:48.272
old paint cans or anything like

16:48.274 --> 16:49.874
that, but hopefully everything

16:49.876 --> 16:51.275
down here, you know, has been

16:51.277 --> 16:52.377
properly painted and put where

16:52.379 --> 16:53.611
it's supposed to be.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.712
So you know what I'm saying?

16:54.714 --> 16:55.813
>> No, I don't.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.814
Where's the carbon monoxide

16:56.816 --> 16:57.782
detector?

16:57.784 --> 16:58.649
>> Carbon monoxide detector!

16:58.651 --> 16:59.617
All right, so you reach up there

16:59.619 --> 17:00.551
and you give that a poke and

17:00.553 --> 17:01.285
everything should...

17:01.287 --> 17:01.953
(detector beeps twice)

17:01.955 --> 17:02.720
Great and... oh!

17:02.722 --> 17:04.522
Twice, okay.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.556
>> Excellent.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.557
>> All right, that was

17:06.559 --> 17:07.625
excellent.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.626
>> Uh, I'm feeling a little

17:08.628 --> 17:09.560
light-headed.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.628
>> Yeah, could it be the stairs?

17:10.630 --> 17:11.629
Or, you know, maybe you're just

17:11.631 --> 17:12.630
dizzy by the cleanliness.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.564
So let's get you out of here.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.565
>> What?

17:14.567 --> 17:15.633
>> No sense in lingering around.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.567
You checked the carbon monoxide

17:16.569 --> 17:18.302
and that-that's all you got to

17:18.304 --> 17:19.704
do there-- okay, let's see.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.738
Uh, I think we covered

17:20.740 --> 17:21.739
everything.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.907
I mean, uh, doorknob?

17:22.909 --> 17:24.142
That works.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.376
Showed you all the packaged

17:25.378 --> 17:26.577
produce.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.578
Hey, did you meet our bartender?

17:27.580 --> 17:28.646
>> All right, all right.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.580
>> We're not paying for

17:29.582 --> 17:30.648
contaminated steaks!

17:30.650 --> 17:31.582
You're entire truck is filled

17:31.584 --> 17:32.583
with chickens!

17:32.585 --> 17:33.651
>> You want me to return 4,000

17:33.653 --> 17:34.585
steaks?

17:34.587 --> 17:35.586
This restaurant is insane.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.654
>> "Restaurant"?

17:36.656 --> 17:37.588
>> Uh, well, yeah, if you count

17:37.590 --> 17:38.656
a bowl of peanuts, you know?

17:38.658 --> 17:39.590
We get the drunks in here, they

17:39.592 --> 17:40.591
get all ornery and confused.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.426
What are you gonna do?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.427
It comes with the territory.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.428
Well, I'd love to spend a little

17:43.430 --> 17:44.328
bit more time in here...

17:44.330 --> 17:45.263
>> Ah, that's about it,

17:45.265 --> 17:45.830
Mr. Kelly.

17:45.832 --> 17:46.564
>> That's it?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.165
>> Yeah.

17:47.167 --> 17:47.832
>> Oh...

17:47.834 --> 17:50.001
>> Hey!

17:50.003 --> 17:51.402
>> Yes? Are you talking to me?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.704
(grunts)

17:53.706 --> 17:55.840
>> Yeah.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.276
>> What is it?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.847
>> All right, all right,

18:02.849 --> 18:04.348
all right.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.018
>> Yes. Okay.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.286
>> You know, all right,

18:08.288 --> 18:09.253
all right, all right.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.555
Kind of says it all.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.622
So, here we go.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.690
Uh, last thing, Sandy.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.092
Is this concrete regulation?

18:14.094 --> 18:15.226
You know, I know there's some

18:15.228 --> 18:16.227
cracks and...

18:16.229 --> 18:17.195
>> It looks fine.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.396
But I'll tell you what's not

18:18.398 --> 18:19.464
fine, Mr. Kelly, and that's the

18:19.466 --> 18:20.932
Dumpster.

18:20.934 --> 18:21.966
The regulation is exactly six

18:21.968 --> 18:24.035
feet, and you were at five and

18:24.037 --> 18:25.236
a half.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.404
>> Oh, that goddamn bitch.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.972
>> I know Alan would let this

18:27.974 --> 18:30.408
slide, but I'm not Alan.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.909
I'll have to dock you for that.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.377
>> Okay, well, I understand, and

18:33.379 --> 18:34.745
I assure you that those

18:34.747 --> 18:35.713
responsible, they'll be dealt

18:35.715 --> 18:36.581
with.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.448
>> However, you do have an

18:37.450 --> 18:39.250
amazingly clean bar, and

18:39.252 --> 18:41.819
therefore I'm giving Paddy's Pub

18:41.821 --> 18:43.721
the highest possible grade.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.722
>> You are?

18:44.724 --> 18:45.590
>> Congratulations.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.991
>> (laughs) Oh, my... You got me

18:46.993 --> 18:48.259
with the whole Dumpster thing!

18:48.261 --> 18:49.560
Oh, man, that's really, really

18:49.562 --> 18:50.128
exciting stuff!

18:50.130 --> 18:50.995
>> Oh, well...

18:50.997 --> 18:52.630
>> It's just really fantastic.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.265
>> That was nice.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.399
Have a wonderful day.

18:55.401 --> 18:55.933
>> Okay.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.236
(panting)

18:58.238 --> 19:01.405
Okay.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.607
(all clamoring)

19:02.609 --> 19:03.574
>> Guys, we got the highest

19:03.576 --> 19:04.642
grade!

19:04.644 --> 19:05.643
I didn't think we were gonna do

19:05.645 --> 19:06.644
it 'cause of the Dumpster, but,

19:06.646 --> 19:07.612
man, she got us the highest

19:07.614 --> 19:08.646
grade!

19:08.648 --> 19:09.647
>> The highest grade of...?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.615
>> The health inspection!

19:10.617 --> 19:11.616
We passed the health inspection!

19:11.618 --> 19:13.017
Boo!

19:13.019 --> 19:14.318
>> Oh, yeah, we don't, we don't

19:14.320 --> 19:15.286
give a shit about that.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.320
>> Yeah, we were excited about

19:16.322 --> 19:17.321
the airline miles thing.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.422
>> Well, yeah, that's cool, too,

19:18.424 --> 19:19.357
but the health inspection was

19:19.359 --> 19:20.091
the whole thing, man!

19:20.093 --> 19:20.825
I pulled it off!

19:20.827 --> 19:21.759
It was like, "Here goes there!"

19:21.761 --> 19:22.760
I did the whole thing.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.794
>> Uh, Charlie, come on.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.795
We always pass, okay?

19:24.797 --> 19:25.796
We never have a hard time

19:25.798 --> 19:26.764
passing. It's not a big deal.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.798
Nobody gives a shit.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.766
You didn't do anything that

19:28.768 --> 19:29.767
special. (shrieks)

19:29.769 --> 19:30.801
(laughter)

19:30.803 --> 19:31.769
>> That's how you make a joke

19:31.771 --> 19:33.371
stool right there! That's...

19:33.373 --> 19:34.372
>> Ow, Charlie!

19:34.374 --> 19:35.106
>> Did you do that?

19:35.108 --> 19:35.840
>> Yeah, you know what?

19:35.842 --> 19:36.440
I think I did.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.041
>> You did it?

19:37.043 --> 19:37.808
Oh, that's so funny!

19:37.810 --> 19:38.609
>> Are you kidding me?

19:38.611 --> 19:39.644
>> I thought I saw you!

19:39.646 --> 19:40.711
>> Are you kidding?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.747
Unbelievable.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.455
(trio chanting backwards)
