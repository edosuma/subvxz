WEBVTT

00:01.961 --> 00:04.494
Reagan is moving in today
and I don't want her thinking

00:04.496 --> 00:06.630
that we're making a big fuss
about it.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.298
Hey, Schmidty,
what are you doing, bud?

00:08.300 --> 00:10.000
I'm opening up
a subtle Montepulciano.

00:10.002 --> 00:11.068
It's a welcoming wine.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.469
Put out nothing!
Be cool.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.470
(groans)
Winston,

00:13.472 --> 00:14.838
when she gets here,
act casually.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.973
Pretend like you didn't
even know she was coming.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.342
As I live and breathe,

00:18.344 --> 00:20.477
Raisin?!

00:20.479 --> 00:21.578
Aw, did I say Raisin?
Yeah.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.480
Too weird. Go practice
in your room.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.482
I'm very mad at you. Go.
What is happening?

00:25.484 --> 00:26.850
Hi.
It needs to look messier.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.185
It needs to look messy.

00:28.187 --> 00:30.087
You are having a straight up
anxiety attack right now.

00:30.089 --> 00:31.321
Nick, Nick, calm down.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.823
You guys lived together
in New Orleans.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.992
If the old girl
didn't like the dinner,

00:34.994 --> 00:36.827
she wouldn't come back
for seconds.

00:36.829 --> 00:37.928
New Orleans was temporary. Okay?

00:37.930 --> 00:40.998
Reagan has never
stayed in one place too long.

00:41.000 --> 00:41.999
If she thinks
we're making a big deal,

00:42.001 --> 00:43.100
she's gonna feel smothered.

00:43.102 --> 00:44.001
Okay? So you've got
to do the opposite.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.836
It's not a big deal.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.105
That's why I didn't pick
her up from the airport.

00:48.107 --> 00:49.339
You didn't pick her up
from the airport?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.173
Didn't this woman change

00:50.175 --> 00:51.208
her whole job

00:51.210 --> 00:53.176
so she can move here
to be with you?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.012
She is gonna be pissed.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.013
Uh, no.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.848
No.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.116
(whispering):
Yes, she is.

00:59.118 --> 01:00.217
No, you're wrong.
She's gonna be relieved.

01:00.219 --> 01:01.184
Pissed.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.352
No, she isn't. You're wrong.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.353
No.
Reagan hates,

01:03.355 --> 01:05.689
hates this kind of stuff.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.857
In New Orleans,

01:06.859 --> 01:07.958
once while
she was sleeping,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.860
I tried to cover her
with a blanket to be sweet

01:09.862 --> 01:11.128
and she basically
choked me out.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.362
I understand that.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.064
What's in the bag, Jess?
(chuckles)

01:14.066 --> 01:15.232
These are old lady caramels,

01:15.234 --> 01:17.034
just a little thing that
Reagan and I have.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.235
You and Reagan have things?

01:18.237 --> 01:19.236
I didn't even know
you guys were in touch.

01:19.238 --> 01:20.971
Yeah, we text. You know.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.472
We also send each other pictures

01:22.474 --> 01:24.875
of bears wearing backpacks
and other humorous exchanges.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.643
What?

01:26.645 --> 01:27.577
How about we all relax
with a nice cheese plate?

01:27.579 --> 01:29.146
Look at that halloumi.

01:29.148 --> 01:30.914
Love halloumi.
No, no, no, no
no, no, no.
What?

01:30.916 --> 01:31.915
Too late. You're banned.
Go to Winston's room

01:31.917 --> 01:32.983
right now.

01:32.985 --> 01:35.485
Reagan!
Hi.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.054
Hey.
Oh, Reagan,
it's good to see you.

01:37.056 --> 01:37.921
You made it.

01:37.923 --> 01:38.889
Hey.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.924
Uh, two duffel bags,
that's all?

01:40.926 --> 01:43.226
Yeah, well, I travel light,
which is lucky for me

01:43.228 --> 01:45.395
because the only way I could
get here from the airport

01:45.397 --> 01:46.897
was to split a cab with a lady

01:46.899 --> 01:48.298
who was eating a sub
from the middle.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.167
JESS:
Ha-ha!

01:50.169 --> 01:51.935
(in old woman voice):
Caramel?

01:51.937 --> 01:54.604
Well, I can't eat these yet
'cause I don't have my teeth in.

01:54.606 --> 01:55.605
JESS (in old woman voice):
It reminds me

01:55.607 --> 01:57.107
of a cardboard tea set

01:57.109 --> 01:58.942
I had during the war.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.444
What am I looking at?
We had to save

02:00.446 --> 02:02.846
all the metal
for the boys.
(chuckles)

02:02.848 --> 02:04.614
Well, look who it is.

02:04.616 --> 02:05.749
Raisin.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.518
I said Raisin again,
didn't I?

02:08.520 --> 02:10.587
¶ ¶

02:12.291 --> 02:15.092
Hey, Jess. How are you doing
with everything?

02:15.094 --> 02:17.194
You know, Nick, Reagan,
living across the hall.

02:17.196 --> 02:18.428
Totally fine.
I didn't hear a thing.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.763
I took every precaution.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.531
NICK (muffled):
Oh, Reagan.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.033
(Reagan giggling)
(fan whirring)

02:23.035 --> 02:24.101
NICK (muffled):
Okay, now.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.169
(vacuum whirring)

02:28.974 --> 02:30.974
That was a good call.
They sounded like two Germans

02:30.976 --> 02:33.110
having a sponge fight.
Aah, aah...

02:33.112 --> 02:34.211
That's how I was.
It was disgusting.

02:34.213 --> 02:35.946
Gross.
How are you doing otherwise?

02:35.948 --> 02:38.949
I mean, sure, my feelings
for Nick are complicated,

02:38.951 --> 02:40.317
but I have a boyfriend.

02:40.319 --> 02:42.052
He has a girlfriend,

02:42.054 --> 02:43.954
who I have mad
inside jokes with.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.789
Everything's gonna be fine

02:45.791 --> 02:46.990
as long as I stay
out of their stuff.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.059
Hmm.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.161
It's a little weird

02:51.163 --> 02:51.995
he didn't pick her up
from the airport,

02:51.997 --> 02:54.131
though, right?

02:56.135 --> 02:58.001
That's an example of the stuff
that I'd like to stay out of.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.703
Hmm.

03:00.572 --> 03:01.638
Oh.
You've been practicing.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.472
Ow.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.474
St... (groans)
Yes.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.475
Hello, normals.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.477
Hey.
I just got back

03:07.479 --> 03:08.478
from the chair district

03:08.480 --> 03:10.147
where I found the perfect

03:10.149 --> 03:11.715
sitting piece for our home.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.484
It's an original Haberman.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.154
Hmm.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.089
(chuckles)

03:19.091 --> 03:20.590
It's a Haberman.

03:22.094 --> 03:24.327
It's a Haberman.
It's not helping

03:24.329 --> 03:25.996
you to repeat it
over and over again.

03:25.998 --> 03:29.332
A print ad for it features
a quote from David Strathairn.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.200
(under breath):
Str...

03:30.202 --> 03:31.201
What do you got to say now?

03:31.203 --> 03:32.736
(jukebox skipping)
Ugh.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.273
Well, there goes
the jukebox.

03:36.275 --> 03:37.207
It's been on the fritz
for weeks.

03:37.209 --> 03:38.341
I know.
Whoa.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.709
Hold on, now.

03:39.711 --> 03:41.011
It might have some life
left in it,

03:41.013 --> 03:43.280
thanks to Dr. The Fonz.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.082
Heyyy...

03:48.353 --> 03:49.853
(Winston laughs)

03:49.855 --> 03:52.522
Check me out.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.857
(glass shatters)

03:53.859 --> 03:55.225
What the hell?
Winston!

03:55.227 --> 03:56.226
Ooh!

03:56.228 --> 03:57.894
That's the least
Fonzie move ever.

03:57.896 --> 03:59.029
It was borderline Chachi.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.297
I just wanted to be...

04:00.299 --> 04:01.965
Art Fonzarelli for a day.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.200
Ugh.
You know? Black dude

04:03.202 --> 04:04.901
playing a Jewish dude,
playing an Italian dude

04:04.903 --> 04:06.069
and the world goes 'round.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.971
I think I have some
speakers behind the bar.

04:07.973 --> 04:08.972
I'll just hook up my phone.

04:08.974 --> 04:09.873
WINSTON:
Wait, wait, wait.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.041
Time out, time out, time out.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.209
I know I just did something
really stupid,

04:12.211 --> 04:13.243
but why do you automatically

04:13.245 --> 04:14.211
get to be in charge
of the music?

04:14.213 --> 04:15.478
'Cause I have the best taste.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.780
(Cece and Winston laughing)

04:18.750 --> 04:20.383
Oh, no, no, babe.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.319
All you like is electronica.

04:22.321 --> 04:24.154
It's EDM,
electronic dance music...

04:24.156 --> 04:26.723
Yeah, here we go.
...or what I like
to refer to it as,

04:26.725 --> 04:29.392
as just "M",
because it's the only music.
Music.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.262
Yeah, listen, Schmidt,
it's trash.

04:32.264 --> 04:33.897
Need I remind you that you
started a petition to get

04:33.899 --> 04:36.333
Enya to play
at the Super Bowl halftime show?

04:36.335 --> 04:37.734
You're misrepresenting
my petition.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.769
Okay? I wanted her to play
on the field

04:39.771 --> 04:40.937
during the fourth quarter.

04:40.939 --> 04:42.072
Schmidt, I bet

04:42.074 --> 04:43.840
I could make a fake EDM song

04:43.842 --> 04:45.909
and you couldn't tell it
apart from a real one.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.278
'Cause they all sound like
a robot having a seizure.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.747
Noice.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.515
(chuckles)
Not loving this dynamic.

04:52.517 --> 04:53.416
We don't care.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.417
We'll test it out.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.752
Cece and I will make a song.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.621
Ooh.
And if we
fool you,

04:57.623 --> 04:59.789
we're in charge
of the music in the bar,

04:59.791 --> 05:01.424
All Enya, all up in ya.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.959
I'm in.
Great.

05:02.961 --> 05:05.195
Have fun looking like idiots,
you morons.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.034
I don't really
have any place to go.

05:11.036 --> 05:13.203
I mean, I came here to hang out
with you guys, so...

05:13.205 --> 05:14.871
Hey, you two lovebirds.

05:14.873 --> 05:16.539
It's your first day
of living together.

05:16.541 --> 05:18.108
So, what are you doing tonight?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.609
I can't do anything tonight.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.444
I picked up an extra
shift at the bar.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.879
No big deal, right?

05:22.881 --> 05:24.114
Yeah.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.148
It's totally fine.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.316
NICK:
Everything's
totally fine

05:26.318 --> 05:27.450
and we are good.

05:29.988 --> 05:31.821
Okay, well how about you?
You want to go out

05:31.823 --> 05:33.290
and maybe have like
a little ladies' night?

05:33.292 --> 05:34.958
I just feel like
getting really dumb.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.460
Yeah. Dude, I'm the dumbest.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.461
It's a date.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.963
I am gonna take
a seven-minute power nap

05:39.965 --> 05:41.464
and then go for a run to preempt

05:41.466 --> 05:42.999
all of this damage
we're gonna do.

05:43.001 --> 05:44.467
I love it, I love it,
I love it.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.302
(chuckling):
Sounds good.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.903
How'd I do?

05:46.905 --> 05:48.305
I'm sorry. What?

05:48.307 --> 05:50.740
With the whole I got to go
to work and cover some shifts.

05:50.742 --> 05:52.008
I don't have to go to work.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.343
I don't have
work tonight.

05:53.345 --> 05:54.411
I'm actually gonna go

05:54.413 --> 05:55.412
to a bowling alley and, uh,

05:55.414 --> 05:57.314
get some beers
and watch people bowl.

05:57.316 --> 06:01.151
You lied to Reagan,
so you can watch strangers bowl?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.919
Yeah, definitely.

06:02.921 --> 06:04.854
I'm trying to play it cool.
I don't want to seem needy.

06:04.856 --> 06:07.090
Are you sure you want to start
this thing off with Reagan

06:07.092 --> 06:08.258
by playing a game?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.427
You know what?

06:10.429 --> 06:12.662
Actually...

06:12.664 --> 06:13.997
I don't want to get involved.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.332
(chuckles)
Do whatever you want.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.334
Just don't tell me about it
'cause Jess is out.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.537
I put a Lego in my shoe
to really push myself.

06:20.539 --> 06:21.438
That sounds painful.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.672
(laughs)
Cool, cool, cool.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.008
Have a lot of fun tonight.
Have fun. Okay?

06:25.010 --> 06:26.009
Fun at ladies' night.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.444
Thanks.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.448
Ladies night!

06:36.355 --> 06:38.021
You're such a lightweight.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.223
I feel fine.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.692
Hell of a ladies' night, though.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.695
A lot of secrets came out
last night, didn't they?

06:47.966 --> 06:49.032
Secrets?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.635
Cece!

06:52.637 --> 06:53.870
(exhales)
I think I really
screwed up

06:53.872 --> 06:55.905
ladies' night.
I know I reek.

06:55.907 --> 06:56.873
(coughs)
Please, please,
don't gag

06:56.875 --> 06:58.141
because then I will gag.

06:58.143 --> 06:59.476
Okay, okay,
it's really hard though, man.

06:59.478 --> 07:00.710
I think something
terrible happened.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.878
Reagan said,

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
"A lot of secrets came out
last night."

07:03.882 --> 07:05.382
Uh-oh, you think
she knows about Nick?

07:05.384 --> 07:07.050
I mean, I only have one secret,
so...

07:07.052 --> 07:08.818
it's got to be
the Nick thing.
It's the Nick thing.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.754
This is bad. Really bad.

07:10.756 --> 07:11.588
Yeah, it's not good.

07:11.590 --> 07:12.822
Ah, how could I let this happen?

07:12.824 --> 07:14.057
(retching)
(gagging)

07:14.059 --> 07:15.392
I'm sorry, I was holding
my breath the whole time.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.393
(retching)

07:16.395 --> 07:18.561
(gagging)

07:18.563 --> 07:19.929
(blowing)

07:19.931 --> 07:21.498
(coughing)

07:21.500 --> 07:22.832
(retching)

07:26.905 --> 07:28.938
Oh, my God.
(groans)

07:28.940 --> 07:31.274
You need to calm down.
All right, just take a breath.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.909
Think of Michelle Obama.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.744
(sighing):
She's so strong.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.112
See, it's working already.

07:36.114 --> 07:37.914
Besides, you don't even know
what you told Reagan.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.517
I know she said that we have
a secret between us.

07:40.519 --> 07:42.419
You don't just say that.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.620
Okay, all right.
Tell me what you remember.

07:43.622 --> 07:45.288
Let's just piece together
what happened.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.322
Just the two of you?

07:47.292 --> 07:48.591
Oh, look.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.261
This bar has hooks for
our purses. (chuckles)

07:51.263 --> 07:52.796
Score. Thank you.

07:52.798 --> 07:54.297
Skip to the next track.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.933
Splash, bitch, splash!

07:56.935 --> 07:59.035
I'm gonna splash you
in your dumb wet face.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.937
(laughing)
I really need to wash my hands.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.772
New friend!
New friend!

08:02.774 --> 08:04.707
Is this leading to the secret?

08:04.709 --> 08:05.975
I don't know, Cece.

08:05.977 --> 08:08.044
My brain is a smoking wreckage

08:08.046 --> 08:09.813
and I'm trying to find
the black box.

08:09.815 --> 08:10.814
Okay, let's try
to jump-start it.

08:10.816 --> 08:12.782
Okay? Let me try something.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.817
Secret!

08:13.819 --> 08:14.884
Secret.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.453
Secret!
What are you doing?

08:16.455 --> 08:17.654
Secret!
This is not gonna work.

08:17.656 --> 08:19.055
Secret!
It was something about a pool.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.458
Oh, my God, Cece.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.459
You're amazing.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.660
You should work for the CIA.

08:23.662 --> 08:25.562
I know.
Stay focused on the pool.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.965
I hate the way that tastes.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.667
Idea.
What?

08:30.669 --> 08:31.734
Let's go to the pool.

08:31.736 --> 08:33.303
Is "pool" cocaine?

08:33.305 --> 08:34.137
I mean,

08:34.139 --> 08:35.472
is "the pool," like,

08:35.474 --> 08:36.673
a drug thing?
'Cause I don't "swim."

08:36.675 --> 08:38.575
Like, I-I don't judge people
who do "swim,"

08:38.577 --> 08:39.909
but I don't.
No,

08:39.911 --> 08:40.977
it's a real pool.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.479
An actual pool at my apartment,

08:42.481 --> 08:43.980
my other apartment.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.048
(gasps)

08:46.651 --> 08:48.251
(whispers):
I have another apartment.

08:48.253 --> 08:50.253
No, no...
It's a secret.

08:50.255 --> 08:51.521
Don't tell Nick,
don't tell Nick.

08:51.523 --> 08:53.423
No.
Shh.

08:53.425 --> 08:55.024
Oh, no.
Shh, shh, shh, shh,

08:55.026 --> 08:56.593
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

08:56.595 --> 08:59.496
Okay, well, it's time
to do future Jess a solid

08:59.498 --> 09:02.599
and black the hell out.

09:02.601 --> 09:04.334
Reagan has a secret apartment.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.502
A secret apartment?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.837
Past Jess was trying
to keep me out of this.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.606
What is she, a D.C. madam?

09:09.608 --> 09:11.574
I have to make sure
Nick never finds out about this.

09:12.611 --> 09:14.844
You know what?

09:14.846 --> 09:16.012
I'm gonna stay out of it.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.780
Hmm.
Classic Jess,

09:17.782 --> 09:20.416
staying all the way out of it.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.053
When we are done with this song,

09:24.055 --> 09:26.456
Schmidt will totally think

09:26.458 --> 09:29.058
it is by Diplo or Garrix

09:29.060 --> 09:30.026
or Deadmau5.

09:30.562 --> 09:31.561
What is this?

09:31.563 --> 09:32.629
Don't worry about that,

09:32.631 --> 09:33.630
your mind is
in a weird situation.

09:33.632 --> 09:34.864
First things first.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.033
I recorded a bunch of noises
around the loft.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.034
Right?
Mm-hmm.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.369
So we could use it as the hook.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.704
It is the mark of any EDM song.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.872
Okay.
Now, check this one out.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.875
Nick shaving
without shaving cream.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.878
(Nick grunting)

09:48.880 --> 09:50.980
He's bleeding at this point.
It's good, I'm just
laughing at...

09:50.982 --> 09:52.916
Yeah, it's nasty.
Okay, check this one out.
Just seeing him.

09:52.918 --> 09:54.717
SCHMIDT: Haberman, my Haberman.
Haberman, my Haberman.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.052
My-my-my-my Haberman.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.887
This one has a pretty
good rhythm to it.
All right,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.722
this one right here is about
to set the city up topsy-turvy.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.924
All right.
Ferguson going to town

10:00.926 --> 10:02.892
on Jess's bunny slippers.

10:02.894 --> 10:06.729
(restrained laughter)

10:06.731 --> 10:08.064
It's not-- nothing.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.233
Ferguson, you nasty.
Did you hit the button?

10:10.235 --> 10:12.068
You see, he's a gentle lover.
You understand?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.336
That's why you can't really
hear anything,

10:13.338 --> 10:15.605
but you can feel
what the slipper is feeling.

10:15.607 --> 10:18.074
There's no sound.
I can't hear anything.
No, you got to-- he's a...

10:18.076 --> 10:19.576
He's a gentle lover.
There's no sound in there!

10:19.578 --> 10:20.743
He's a gentle lover!
You're just there with the phone

10:20.745 --> 10:21.578
and there's no sound.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.445
Hello.
You don't understand.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.346
Oh, hey.

10:23.348 --> 10:24.847
Yeah, it's not so easy, is it?

10:24.849 --> 10:25.915
Can't just snap your fingers

10:25.917 --> 10:29.586
and become a couple
of Calvin Harrises-e-es.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.020
WINSTON:
Listen, this is all

10:31.022 --> 10:32.789
part of our process, okay?
So beat it.
Yeah.

10:32.791 --> 10:33.756
CECE: Shoo.
We got a song to write

10:33.758 --> 10:34.857
that's gonna give you

10:34.859 --> 10:37.961
the best damn aural
you have ever had.

10:37.963 --> 10:39.596
Check yourself.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.098
Oh, A-U-R-A-L.

10:42.100 --> 10:42.932
Mmm.
CECE: For your ears.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.935
Yeah.
Noice.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.338
Well, I will see you
on game day, suckas.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.440
Ow.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.609
You're not very scary.

10:52.611 --> 10:53.776
We cannot let him get
away with that, okay?

10:53.778 --> 10:54.978
We need to dig
deep, Winston.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.280
Do I look scared?
(chuckles)

10:57.282 --> 10:58.881
Watch this.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.149
(Nick moaning)

11:00.151 --> 11:01.818
Oh, that's just Nick
eating a microwave burrito.

11:01.820 --> 11:03.653
No, that actually
almost works.

11:03.655 --> 11:04.988
Really?
Yeah.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.222
(Nick moaning rhythmically)

11:06.224 --> 11:07.457
SCHMIDT: Haberman.
JESS: It was something

11:07.459 --> 11:09.125
about a pool.
(Nick moaning rhythmically)

11:09.127 --> 11:11.327
SCHMIDT: Haberman. My-my-my...

11:11.329 --> 11:12.228
What the hell is that?

11:12.230 --> 11:13.229
Hmm? Oh, I recorded

11:13.231 --> 11:14.464
some candid audio. Yeah,

11:14.466 --> 11:17.000
I need this track to be real.
(Nick moaning)

11:17.002 --> 11:18.901
JESS (echoing): Reagan has
a secret apartment.

11:18.903 --> 11:19.969
CECE:
A secret apartment?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.571
(Nick moaning)
SCHMIDT: Haberman.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.172
JESS: Reagan has
a secret apartment.
CECE: A secret apartment?

11:23.174 --> 11:24.641
Wait, what?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.075
Thank you.
It's missing a "what."

11:26.077 --> 11:27.076
What?!

11:27.078 --> 11:29.979
Reagan has a secret apartment?

11:29.981 --> 11:30.980
You feeling it, huh?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.482
WINSTON:
What?!
(Nick moaning)

11:32.484 --> 11:34.150
SCHMIDT: Haberman. My-my-my...
Oh, oh.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.151
(Nick moaning)

11:35.153 --> 11:36.853
That's very bad. I'm sorry, man.

11:36.855 --> 11:38.154
JESS (echoing):
Reagan has a secret apartment.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.322
WINSTON:
What?!

11:39.324 --> 11:40.823
(laughing):
This track is right, though.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.158
Reagan has a secret apartment.
CECE: A secret apartment?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.160
SCHMIDT: Haberman.
WINSTON: What?!

11:46.665 --> 11:49.165
I can't believe my girlfriend
has a secret apartment!

11:49.167 --> 11:51.000
I'm sure there's
some explanation.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.669
I can think of one
of two things. One,

11:52.671 --> 11:53.770
she's worried she's
making a mistake

11:53.772 --> 11:55.171
by living with me.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.041
Or two, and this one
is way more realistic,

11:58.043 --> 11:59.342
she has a secret family.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.510
Only men have secret families.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.545
Look, just go talk to Reagan.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.846
I can't just run
into the bathroom shouting,

12:03.848 --> 12:05.848
"You have a secret apartment,"
Jess.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.450
She'll bolt...

12:07.452 --> 12:09.018
to her secret apartment!

12:09.621 --> 12:10.687
You talk to her.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.021
Find out what the deal is.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.022
No way I'm getting involved.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.891
You leaked the intel to Cece.

12:14.893 --> 12:16.359
You're deeper than any of us.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.027
I was secretly recorded.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.395
That is a felony, by the way.

12:19.397 --> 12:21.030
This is between you and Reagan.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.132
Jess, you've got to talk to her.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.200
You've got to
deal with this.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.201
She trusts you.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.437
Please, you've got to help.

12:28.907 --> 12:30.206
(knocking)

12:30.208 --> 12:31.207
Hey...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.108
Ray Ray.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.077
Boo Boo?

12:34.079 --> 12:35.878
Is this about the apartment?
Damn.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.880
Jess, I know I put you
in a weird spot

12:37.882 --> 12:40.049
by telling you about it.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.884
Whatever the explanation,
it's okay.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.086
I don't need to know anything

12:43.088 --> 12:45.088
except, like,

12:45.090 --> 12:46.889
when did you get it,

12:46.891 --> 12:48.224
is it, like, a real,

12:48.226 --> 12:51.094
genuine place, or is it, like,
a playing it cool thing,

12:51.096 --> 12:54.063
like Nick's fake bar shift?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.231
What?
What?

12:55.233 --> 12:58.000
You said "fake bar shift,"

12:58.002 --> 12:59.068
so does that mean

12:59.070 --> 13:00.069
that he didn't have to go

13:00.071 --> 13:01.070
to work and that he lied to me?

13:01.072 --> 13:02.271
Oh my God, you know who should

13:02.273 --> 13:03.439
talk to about this,
because he could

13:03.441 --> 13:05.007
answer all your questions,
is Nick.

13:05.009 --> 13:06.409
No.
Nick!

13:06.411 --> 13:07.410
No. I don't want to talk to him
Hey, Nick!

13:07.412 --> 13:08.411
about anything.
Nick!

13:08.413 --> 13:09.679
Oh, weird.

13:09.681 --> 13:11.247
I had no idea you were
having a conversation

13:11.249 --> 13:12.448
(chuckling):
with Reagan right now.

13:12.450 --> 13:13.950
We are in the middle
of a conversation

13:13.952 --> 13:14.951
that we need to finish,

13:14.953 --> 13:16.853
so maybe we'll do that
over drinks.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.287
Did you have other plans?
Maybe you wanted

13:18.289 --> 13:20.089
to have a conversation
with somebody.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.424
Well, I'd love to finish
our conversation, Jess,

13:21.426 --> 13:23.092
so maybe you and<i> I </i>
should get a drink.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.594
You know what?
After last night,

13:24.596 --> 13:25.928
the only drink I can handle

13:25.930 --> 13:27.797
is room temperature milk.
You guys got crazy?

13:27.799 --> 13:29.098
Don't worry about it. I just
really would want to be able...

13:29.100 --> 13:31.033
I would love to finish
our conversation.

13:31.035 --> 13:34.036
We started ours first, so we
should finish ours earlier.

13:34.038 --> 13:35.138
It's basic time science.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.038
It's time science?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.206
Yeah, it's time science.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.474
You told me that
you don't believe in watches

13:38.476 --> 13:39.942
or clocks,
so I don't really think

13:39.944 --> 13:41.144
this is a very valid argument.
No, I said I believe

13:41.146 --> 13:43.946
in watches, I just don't trust
who sets them.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.782
Who sets the time?
You set the time.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.116
Why would I set the time?
It's my watch.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.885
Okay, see? Talking is fun.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.653
Why don't you guys

13:50.655 --> 13:52.321
continue this conversation

13:52.323 --> 13:53.389
at the bar...

13:54.993 --> 13:56.125
...by yourselves,

13:56.127 --> 13:58.127
without me?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.029
I'll have a milk.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.800
So in front of you,
you have two songs,

14:03.802 --> 14:06.235
one by a recognized EDM
"artist,"

14:06.237 --> 14:07.203
quotes intended,

14:07.739 --> 14:10.072
the other is by me.

14:10.074 --> 14:12.141
CECE:
I also helped.
(mocking):
Yeah, okay.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.142
I did!

14:13.144 --> 14:15.478
Lay it on me.
Here we go.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.047
¶ ¶

14:19.684 --> 14:21.250
(Nick grunting rhythmically)

14:21.252 --> 14:22.985
Stop.
What?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.654
What?
You're barely seconds in.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.155
Throbbing bass,
the lone whistle,

14:26.157 --> 14:27.990
the gritty caw
of gears grinding.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.992
This is clearly
the work of Tim Bergling,

14:29.994 --> 14:31.160
better known as

14:31.162 --> 14:34.831
Swedish EDM demigod Avicii.
WINSTON: Avicii...

14:34.833 --> 14:36.165
As you were.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.334
Oh, my goodness.
Mm.
Boo-yah.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.770
It sucks to be so...

14:40.772 --> 14:42.505
damn right.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.506
Boo-yah!

14:43.508 --> 14:45.007
Yeah!
Oh!

14:45.009 --> 14:47.109
Those ears heard
a Bishop/Parikh

14:47.111 --> 14:49.178
original track.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.279
This must be a shenanigan.
WINSTON:
No.

14:50.281 --> 14:51.881
EDM is a shenanigan.
Correct.

14:51.883 --> 14:55.017
SCHMIDT:
My-my-my Haberman.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.219
Ha!
Ooh!

14:56.221 --> 14:57.553
(music continues playing)

14:57.555 --> 14:59.355
Yeah.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.690
(Nick moaning)

15:00.692 --> 15:02.692
So now, it's gonna be
all Enya...
All Enya.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.193
...all the time.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.062
Mm!
CECE: All the damn
time, all day.

15:06.064 --> 15:08.064
Amenya!
Enya.

15:08.066 --> 15:10.199
How could I have been so wrong?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.634
Have I...

15:11.636 --> 15:14.570
always had bad taste?
WINSTON:
Just like I said.

15:14.572 --> 15:16.205
Yeah, I said it, too.
Ha. Okay, whatever.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.574
I did!
Yeah, sure. Nobody heard ya.

15:18.576 --> 15:21.377
If I don't have my taste,
then what's real?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.880
Are cargo shorts gorgeous?

15:23.882 --> 15:26.115
Was I wrong about rubber
awareness bracelets?

15:27.418 --> 15:28.885
Should I grow a goatee?

15:28.887 --> 15:30.052
Look, Schmidt, you got fooled.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.921
Who cares, man?
(chuckles)

15:31.923 --> 15:34.223
I care, Winston. I care.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.826
(exhales) I always thought
of myself as a brand,

15:36.828 --> 15:38.261
as a lifestyle,

15:38.263 --> 15:39.595
but now...

15:39.597 --> 15:43.232
you know what,
I'm gonna take back that chair,

15:43.234 --> 15:46.068
and I'm gonna get rid of
all my gingham and I'm gonna...

15:46.070 --> 15:49.171
go buy a 14-pack
of tube socks...

15:49.173 --> 15:51.240
at the grocery store.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.511
We might have taken
this one a little too far.

15:55.513 --> 15:57.613
You took it too far.

15:57.615 --> 15:59.115
Oh,<i> now</i> I'm involved.

15:59.117 --> 16:01.417
¶ ¶

16:01.419 --> 16:03.586
Do you know what
I think is really great?

16:03.588 --> 16:07.256
That Nick made time for us, with
his very busy work schedule.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.425
You know what'd be fun?
If we were all just direct.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.360
(chuckles)
Just, you know, for laughs.
I think

16:11.362 --> 16:13.596
it's really great
that we all, you know,

16:13.598 --> 16:17.433
are just kind of acting
and living like one big family.

16:17.435 --> 16:21.103
One big, happy,
non-secret fam...

16:21.105 --> 16:23.639
I am too hungover to deal with
this, so I'm just gonna say it.

16:23.641 --> 16:26.309
Nick, Reagan knows that you
lied about having to work.

16:26.311 --> 16:28.544
Reagan, Nick knows about
your secret apartment.

16:28.546 --> 16:30.379
Jess!
You told her, Jess?

16:30.381 --> 16:32.949
I'm sorry, but now it's all out
there, so you can talk about it.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.117
I can't believe you told her.
Let's talk about
how mature it is for you

16:35.119 --> 16:38.321
to pretend to not care
that I switched my job

16:38.323 --> 16:40.122
and moved across
the country for you.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.825
You came from Seattle, pal.
That's down.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.461
Are you a cartographer now?
Am I a cartographer?

16:45.463 --> 16:47.396
Yeah, did you get your
Bachelor's in map science?

16:47.398 --> 16:49.632
That's what a map scientist is,
a cartographer?
Yes.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.968
Why is everything a code with
you? Just say map scientist.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.903
Guys, let's just try
being sweet to each other.
Oh,

16:53.905 --> 16:56.572
should we be sweet like
a friend that spills
the other friend's secrets?

16:56.574 --> 16:58.975
That's a good point.
Don't act like you didn't lie.

16:58.977 --> 17:03.145
Your lie was bigger. My lie
didn't require a credit check.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.082
Congratulations, Reagan.
You have more apartments
than I have jeans.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.850
So thank God I have
that apartment.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.652
'Cause guess where
I'm sleeping tonight.
Where?

17:09.654 --> 17:11.320
In...

17:11.322 --> 17:14.156
(scoffs)

17:14.158 --> 17:17.159
¶ ¶

17:20.098 --> 17:23.699
Well, I'll be in
the honest apartment!

17:23.701 --> 17:26.869
You said that a full two
seconds after the door shut.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.571
All right, but I still said it.

17:32.276 --> 17:35.511
This is definitely one of those
creepy apartment complexes

17:35.513 --> 17:38.014
for divorced dads
and child actors.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.016
(shouts):
Reagan!
What are we doing here?

17:40.018 --> 17:42.018
I thought your whole thing
was not getting involved.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.021
All I want is
to not be involved,

17:45.023 --> 17:47.623
but you and Reagan are acting
like complete idiots,

17:47.625 --> 17:50.726
and for friend reasons
and just basic human decency,

17:50.728 --> 17:52.061
I can't walk away.

17:52.063 --> 17:54.130
Reagan!
MAN: Quiet, please.

17:54.132 --> 17:56.198
I'm trying to enjoy
my supermarket salad.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.600
REAGAN:
Why are you guys here?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.971
Hey.
What are you doing?
You... you 'cuing?

18:01.973 --> 18:03.873
I grill. It calms me down.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.042
That's cool.
JESS:
Okay,

18:06.044 --> 18:07.910
you guys need
to start being honest,

18:07.912 --> 18:10.546
and I can't help,
because this whole thing--

18:10.548 --> 18:12.982
the three of us living
together-- is awkward enough

18:12.984 --> 18:16.552
without me being in the middle.
All right? So, work it out...

18:16.554 --> 18:17.887
now.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.157
¶ ¶

18:24.062 --> 18:25.895
Get in here.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.898
The code is, uh... 1234#.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.899
(beeping, clangs)

18:29.901 --> 18:31.734
That's not the code.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.936
It's 1234#.
(beeping)

18:33.938 --> 18:36.005
It doesn't work.

18:36.007 --> 18:38.007
It's #1234, guy.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.443
Oh.
Yeah, that works.
Thanks, man.
MAN: Yep.

18:40.445 --> 18:42.645
(door closes)

18:50.922 --> 18:53.422
See myself out.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.025
I got to say, a lot
of international people

18:56.027 --> 18:57.126
living here, it's...

18:57.128 --> 18:58.928
there's good
and bad in that, huh?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.763
I feel like we should
probably...

19:00.765 --> 19:01.931
revisit that.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.432
What about your thing, Reagan?

19:03.434 --> 19:04.934
Uh, okay.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.136
Well, my company
rents apartments

19:07.138 --> 19:09.705
for all of their transplants.

19:11.876 --> 19:14.310
And I guess I didn't tell you
about it because...

19:14.312 --> 19:16.445
I'm scared,

19:16.447 --> 19:19.882
and I wanted a backup plan.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.617
It checks out.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.718
I just felt like

19:22.720 --> 19:24.954
if I came on too strong,

19:24.956 --> 19:27.123
i-it would scare you away.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.791
That's why I lied.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.727
It checks out.
I didn't want
you feeling, like,

19:31.729 --> 19:33.462
you know, you were trapped
in some sack.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.131
Trapped in a sack?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.066
I don't want you to
feel trapped in a sack.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.568
I wish you had used
a less alarming analogy.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.070
Yeah, women are always
afraid of being

19:41.072 --> 19:42.972
trapped in sacks.
It's a little dark.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.974
MAN: Will you just kiss
her already, dude?

19:44.976 --> 19:47.143
Please tell me you don't know
this guy's name.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.578
I don't know the guy's name.
That's good. That's a positive.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.981
(laughter)
MAN: My name's Kevin.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.752
WINSTON:
Wow.

19:56.754 --> 19:58.487
Cowboy hat, hockey jersey,

19:58.489 --> 20:00.022
drinking from a Styrofoam cup.

20:00.024 --> 20:00.990
You called it perfectly, Cece.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.491
CECE:
Pick yourself up.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.160
Figuratively and
literally, 'cause we still

20:04.162 --> 20:05.427
haven't fumigated for weevils.

20:05.429 --> 20:07.429
Let the weevils take me away.
It was just

20:07.431 --> 20:09.598
a song. Okay? Your
taste is your taste.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.200
It doesn't matter
who else likes it.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.002
WINSTON: Yeah, I mean,
look at Cece, for instance.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.104
She's still rocking
that Planet Hollywood jacket,

20:15.106 --> 20:17.506
and that thing is ugly as hell,
man. Like, it's a really

20:17.508 --> 20:19.675
terrible jacket, and I don't
get why she wears it.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.011
CECE: I mean, take
Winston, for example.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.013
He eats onions like apples.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.281
It's disgusting,

20:25.283 --> 20:26.715
his breath smells bad,

20:26.717 --> 20:28.184
it makes no sense, but...
Yeah, man.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.186
I be eating them things
right down to the core,

20:30.188 --> 20:32.121
man. (chuckles)
Yeah, and you like EDM.

20:32.123 --> 20:34.723
You know what else you like?
(door opens)

20:34.725 --> 20:38.127
A brand-new

20:38.129 --> 20:40.196
fancy chair!
(laughter)
Chair? I thought this

20:40.198 --> 20:42.064
was the base of a fish tank.
(laughs)

20:42.066 --> 20:44.366
NICK: Here you go, man.
REAGAN: Happy birthday, Schmidt.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.202
It's not his birthday.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.037
Then why are we doing this?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.805
CECE: Schmidt, you love
this chair, right?

20:49.807 --> 20:52.241
Told you to sit on it, Potsie!
REAGAN: The store
had free delivery.

20:52.243 --> 20:53.242
I don't understand
what's going on.
I know.

20:53.244 --> 20:54.710
We just do things sometimes.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.278
I never understood it either.

comfortable?
Absolutely not.

It's a Haberman.
