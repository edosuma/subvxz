00:01.890 --> 00:05.650
Go on and run,
run for our lives.

00:05.650 --> 00:08.660
We'll tear a hole in every
fence and every wall.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.360
Peter Rabbit!

00:09.360 --> 00:11.290
Run through the fields.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.380
Run wild and free.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.079
And grab a piece of
every radish that we see.

00:16.079 --> 00:16.780
Peter Rabbit!

00:16.780 --> 00:18.760

Tale of The One Who Got Away."

00:53.590 --> 00:55.530
Oh.

00:55.530 --> 00:59.040
I did everything you told me to
do, and it's still not working.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.380
Let me show you.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.410
OK.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.470
Flat arm, and loose
wrist, pull back.

01:04.470 --> 01:06.660
That's what I did.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.580
Huh?

01:08.580 --> 01:11.320
Wait, what's this?

01:11.320 --> 01:13.860
I thought I'd read every
page of my dad's journal,

01:13.860 --> 01:16.870
but I never saw that before.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.090
That's a big fish.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.500
A really big fish.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.190
Wow!

01:21.190 --> 01:23.210
The biggest fish
I've ever seen.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.910
Oh.

01:30.910 --> 01:31.810
What was that?

01:31.810 --> 01:34.039
It's the same fish as
the one in the drawing,

01:34.039 --> 01:36.190
and it's right
here in this lake.

01:36.190 --> 01:39.450
Maybe fishing isn't such
a good idea after all.

01:39.450 --> 01:40.150
Hey!

01:40.150 --> 01:42.430
Let's ask Jeremy
Fisher about it,

01:42.430 --> 01:46.200
he knows everything
about the lake.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.140
Mr. Fisher!

01:47.140 --> 01:47.910
Mr. Fisher!

01:47.910 --> 01:50.789
Mr. Fisher!

01:50.789 --> 01:51.670
Ah!

01:51.670 --> 01:53.340
Peter, Lily, Benjamin.

01:56.220 --> 01:59.620
And Florence.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.430
Oh, what brings
you to these parts?

02:04.040 --> 02:04.890
No!

02:04.890 --> 02:09.030
That fish is the reason why I
don't go far out to the lake

02:09.030 --> 02:10.650
anymore.

02:10.650 --> 02:11.850
Who is he?

02:11.850 --> 02:15.300
The meanest, strongest,
nastiest fish of all.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.400
No one has ever come
close to catching him.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.350
Except, except--

02:26.810 --> 02:29.180
Oh, no you don't.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.470
Yes, Mr. Fisher,
no one except?

02:33.470 --> 02:34.370
Where was I?

02:34.370 --> 02:35.750
Oh, yes!

02:35.750 --> 02:38.540
No one except your
father, Peter.

02:38.540 --> 02:42.920
One day he was out fishing,
and he came face to face with--

02:42.920 --> 02:44.100
Oh, no!

02:44.100 --> 02:45.200
I can't say his name.

02:48.180 --> 02:51.390
Please Mr. Fisher, tell us.

02:51.390 --> 02:52.170
Jack Sharp.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.000
The fish is called Jack Sharp!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.910
There, I've said it.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.360
So what happened?

02:58.360 --> 03:01.260
How come this Jack Sharp
is still in the lake?

03:01.260 --> 03:05.370
Your father was
determined to catch him.

03:05.370 --> 03:08.850
He cast his line,
pulled to the right,

03:08.850 --> 03:11.370
then the left, then right again.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.670
Suddenly, he lost his footing.

03:13.670 --> 03:17.610
But so big was Jack
that he was too

03:17.610 --> 03:21.990
much even for a great adventurer
like your father to reel in.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.760
And?

03:22.760 --> 03:23.460
And?

03:23.460 --> 03:24.990
I went for help.

03:24.990 --> 03:28.920
But when I returned,
Jack Sharp was gone.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.280
And your father never spoke
of the great fish again.

03:33.280 --> 03:40.950
And from that day I called Jack
Sharp, the one that got away.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.070
Can I borrow your fishing
rod, please, Mr. Fisher?

03:49.410 --> 03:52.170
Maybe Jack Sharp is
asleep or something.

03:52.170 --> 03:54.450
Maybe you should
try wiggling the rod?

03:57.920 --> 03:58.910
Nothing.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.760
Can we go home now?

04:00.760 --> 04:01.460
Wait!

04:01.460 --> 04:02.580
I think I've got him.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.820
That's him!

04:07.820 --> 04:08.520
Run!

04:12.480 --> 04:15.370
Well, at least we
know the rod works.

04:15.370 --> 04:18.029
If you're fishing for boots.

04:18.029 --> 04:21.570
What we need is to find
something fish like eating,

04:21.570 --> 04:22.890
like worms.

04:22.890 --> 04:26.400
Fish love eating worms,
I know that for a fact.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.720
Then let's hop to it.

There don't seem to be
any worms here, Peter.

and forget about fishing.

04:42.330 --> 04:43.030

04:51.280 --> 04:54.540
Maybe we could borrow some
worms from Tommy Brock.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.490
No way.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.440
How many do you think we need?

05:00.440 --> 05:02.360
A big fish like Jack
Sharp is going to be

05:02.360 --> 05:06.020
hungry, let's take them all.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.900
Wait, we're going to catch
a mean fish with worms we're

05:08.900 --> 05:11.210
taking from a nasty badger?

05:11.210 --> 05:12.980
Sounds like a bad idea to me.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.670
Relax, Benjamin.

05:14.670 --> 05:18.960
Tommy Brock is sleeping,
what could possibly go wrong?

Give me my worms.

Oh, that was close.

Oh, that was fun.

06:23.000 --> 06:23.810
OK.

06:23.810 --> 06:27.710
So we stick the worm
on the end like this.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.990
Now we should be able
to catch the fish.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.790
Some really big fish.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.080
The biggest fish ever.

We need to go further
out on the lake.

Yes, further out.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.300
Wait, are you sure?

06:42.300 --> 06:44.920
I think we're fine.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.310
So we'll have to build a boat.

06:47.310 --> 06:50.580
Or we could use this one.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.590
We could use that one.
