00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.706
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.311
Previously on Empire...
What is that?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.712
(gasping)
I wouldn't be able to handle

00:11.745 --> 00:13.881
if you lost this election
because of me.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.849
Whoa...
No. I think you should go.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.985
I'm gonna put myself out there,
in solidarity,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.020
alongside Ms. Lyon
and women everywhere.

00:20.054 --> 00:23.524
I love you, Angelo.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.093
What about Freda Gatz?

00:25.126 --> 00:26.860
I heard she out.

00:26.894 --> 00:27.861
I hear she's dope.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.230
Freda's the one, Shine.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.698
She's all yours.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.832
You know,
her father was

00:31.865 --> 00:33.734
locked up with Lucious
and Frank Gathers.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.002
He got killed up there.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.170
The whole concept
of the album,

00:36.204 --> 00:38.106
it's about my family,
the secrets.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.407
I'm-a set us all free.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.209
Jamal, wake up.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.044
D-MAJOR:
I think Jamal O.D.'d.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.118
(sighs) Tiana,
why is it like pulling teeth

00:50.151 --> 00:52.120
every time I talk to you, hmm?

00:52.153 --> 00:55.123
Just get to the damn studio,
girl, okay?

00:55.156 --> 00:57.391
Look, I have not had
my morning coffee yet.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.059
I'm not trying to have
this argument with you--

00:59.093 --> 01:01.762
(dial tone drones)
This bitch hung up on me?

01:01.795 --> 01:02.896
(doorbell rings)

01:02.930 --> 01:05.299
(sighs)

01:07.235 --> 01:09.137
(sighs)
What's up?

01:09.170 --> 01:11.539
Aw, you look agitated. Let me
tell you what you're thinking.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.207
You're thinking, "Oh, didn't I
(phone chiming)

01:13.241 --> 01:14.575
just break up with this fool?
Why is he at my door?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.043
Oh, but he's got
my favorite mocha latte.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.211
Maybe I should..."

01:17.245 --> 01:19.880
(chuckles)
Uh, Angelo,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.450
when I'm agitated, the last
thing you need to be doing

01:22.483 --> 01:25.386
is telling me
why I'm agitated, okay?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.555
Look, I have a record
to produce,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.723
and I have an artist who's
acting like a two-year-old.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.593
Get your punk ass
in the studio.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.828
So thank you for the latte.
Now, why are you here?

01:34.862 --> 01:37.131
Snatch your weave, I can--

01:37.165 --> 01:38.332
(phone continues chiming)

01:38.366 --> 01:40.334
I got your text.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.736
I'm glad you enjoyed
the press conference.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.071
Okay. Can I get my--?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.073
Come here.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.709
I know you know
how I feel about you.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.613
And I think I know
how you feel about me.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.684
So I need to know,

01:56.717 --> 01:59.119
are you in or are you out?

01:59.153 --> 02:00.888
N-Now, wait...

02:06.394 --> 02:08.862
Did you just give me
an ultimatum?

02:08.896 --> 02:09.863
Mm-hmm.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.468
*

02:15.969 --> 02:17.471
(moaning softly)

02:17.505 --> 02:19.440
Okay.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.442
(moans)

02:21.475 --> 02:23.444
Mmm.
Hold up. Wait.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.345
So does this mean you're in?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.747
(belt jangling)

02:28.549 --> 02:30.851
I think this means you're in.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.154
(both moaning)

02:34.188 --> 02:36.590
*

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
Donkey of the Day today goes

02:41.662 --> 02:44.865
to one of Lucious Lyon's
khaki-colored kids, Jamal Lyon.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.668
Here's a guy born
into music royalty,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.303
and then he bitched up
after he got shot. Damn.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.505
I blame your daddy.
It's hard for me to believe

02:51.539 --> 02:54.875
that Lucious could raise such
a soft-ass individual. You know

02:54.908 --> 02:56.310
he's a donkey,
but he's more like a turkey.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.711
He's Donkey of the Day,

02:57.745 --> 02:59.713
but he's Turkey of the Year.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.715
MALE VOICE:
T-T-Turkey of the Year.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.084
(gobbling sounds)

03:04.117 --> 03:05.686
Okay, so what is this for?

03:05.719 --> 03:08.689
Bring me in on a Saturday
to, what, attack me?

03:08.722 --> 03:12.826
No. Everything that Charlamagne
is saying is true,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.728
and it's time
we do something about that.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.164
Where's Mom?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.166
Where's your mama?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.169
She's in charge of music;
this is business.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.839
And right now your stats
are dropping on Empire XStream,

03:25.873 --> 03:28.909
so we need to have a little
conversation about this, son.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.278
I wish that you
literally did not even

03:30.311 --> 03:32.246
buy this-this streaming service,

03:32.280 --> 03:34.582
because, ever since you did,
it kills all creativity.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.418
It's all about numbers now.
It's always been
about numbers.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.087
And right now you ain't puttin'
none up. I'm over here lookin'

03:40.120 --> 03:42.923
at the money that you're
burnin' through to record

03:42.956 --> 03:45.192
this so-called new music of
yours that ain't nobody heard.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.227
That's numbers, too, Mal.
BECKY: Oh, no,

03:47.261 --> 03:49.863
I-I actually heard a lot of
the tracks, and they're lit.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.733
Okay, where they at? A-And
what in the hell is this?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.536
Um, a visual team?
You shootin' a video

03:55.569 --> 03:57.438
and you ain't even finished
the damn record yet?

03:57.471 --> 03:59.106
It's not a video.
It's a visual...

03:59.139 --> 04:01.609
I-It's like
a musical museum.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.277
Um, are you kidding me?

04:03.311 --> 04:04.612
I have the chance right now

04:04.645 --> 04:06.079
to possibly do something
that could change the game.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.649
But if y'all just keep on
killing me with stats,

04:08.682 --> 04:10.250
it's not gonna happen.
No, the only person

04:10.284 --> 04:12.453
that's killing you right now,
Mal, is you.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.622
'Cause the one thing that ain't
changed in the music business

04:14.655 --> 04:18.792
is artists
that don't perform, they die.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.128
He's right, Jamal.
If you don't...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.963
I'm so sorry, Steve.
I'm-I'm not trying to be rude,

04:22.996 --> 04:25.966
but you are in PR.
And my father clearly stated

04:25.999 --> 04:28.736
that this is a business meeting.
So I guess maybe he just needed

04:28.769 --> 04:30.338
a whole bunch of extra bodies
or something. I don't know.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.073
But if you are done
now talking business,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.709
Lucious, then I'm cool.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.113
Look, the numbers are right
where we want them, okay?

04:40.147 --> 04:42.683
So just sit tight,
let me take care of it.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.352
I always do, all right?
MAN: Sounds good, Dre.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.919
Yeah, let me look over
(door opens)

04:45.953 --> 04:47.120
the numbers and then
I'll just give you a...

04:47.154 --> 04:48.689
Um, let me call you back.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.591
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
Hello.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.594
Hello.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.363
What's that face for?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.531
I have an invitation for you

04:57.565 --> 04:59.367
and also a warning.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.836
Okay.
The invitation:

05:02.870 --> 05:04.838
tomorrow night,
it'll be six years

05:04.872 --> 05:06.640
since my brother Stone died.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.876
Every year we have a memorial
for him up by the first building

05:08.909 --> 05:10.711
he and Shine ever bought.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.614
All of our people turn up.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.817
We sing and we party
and we family.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.119
And I would like it if you came.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.854
Of course.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.293
Now for the warning:

05:26.326 --> 05:28.529
Shine kind of wants to kill you.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.863
(door opens)

05:29.897 --> 05:32.132
You and your father sold me

05:32.165 --> 05:34.668
a damn bill of goods
with this Freda Gatz mess.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.405
I told her Lucious
signed her to my label.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.874
Guess what she told me:
that if I ever believed a Lyon,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.543
then I've been played.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.211
She's never gonna record
for Empire again.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.916
I know I didn't spare
your punk-ass life

05:48.949 --> 05:50.183
just to be played.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.820
(chuckles)

05:52.853 --> 05:55.656
Look, I had no idea
that Freda felt that way,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.057
okay?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.192
I'll fix it.
How?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.761
What if I get her to come
to your party tomorrow night?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.696
That's for family.
Exactly.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.764
I think
it's a great idea,

06:03.797 --> 06:06.099
Shine, and I think you
need to bring Freda.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.236
There you go.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.841
PHILIP: Why aren't you
taking this seriously, man?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.175
Drugs are a big deal.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.745
Dude, you need to relax.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.112
He was passed out, not dead.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.881
Yeah, this time.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.016
That doesn't make it okay
for you to feed him drugs.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.020
I'm not some dope boy getting
some white girl hooked on crack.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.789
I'm a producer.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.790
I take the same pills as Jamal.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.358
Hell, everyone does.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.561
Are you that ignorant?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.596
"Everyone does it" is not
an excuse when you got a sit...

06:35.629 --> 06:37.364
Wait, wait, wait.
You know what,
let me tell you something...

06:37.397 --> 06:39.700
Stop. Hey.
We're not doing that.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.934
(laughs)
You're right.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.302
We're not doing that.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.704
Hey.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.139
Now, look, studio time is booked
and I sent you those stems

06:46.173 --> 06:47.608
and you still haven't
worked on them.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.642
I got you.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.880
(quietly): That's the stuff
I was telling you about.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.649
It's a little less harsh than
what the doctor's giving you.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.519
I don't want a repeat
of the other night, all right?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.323
Look, I know that we need to
talk about what happened, okay?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.325
But I can't right now. My
mama's on the way up. So later.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.661
You haven't told her
what happened...
I said later.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.730
That means later.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.765
Y'all need to back up
off me for a second.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.766
Hey, Ma.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.435
Hey.
(chuckles)

07:15.469 --> 07:17.270
Look at my ho'ish baby.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.106
Got two grown men sprung.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.574
First of all,
I'm not ho'in'.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.976
Mmm.
U-Unfortunately.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.312
Look, D-Major is my producer,

07:25.345 --> 07:27.147
and Philip is just my
therapist. That's it.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.749
(chuckles) Look, boy,
I got 15 minutes.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.417
Let me hear this new music.
A'ight.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.020
I got to meet
Angelo's stuck-up mama.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.021
You're meeting his mama already?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.088
I think she just want

07:35.122 --> 07:36.423
to check out my black ass.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.927
You mean your naked selfie
black ass?

07:39.960 --> 07:40.961
Don't be fresh.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.429
Ow!
Now, come on, boy.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.964
Let me hear this.
This is a song for you.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.800
Randy, we good, man. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. What is all this?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.135
Look, first of all,
you're not just hearin' it,

07:48.168 --> 07:49.603
you're not just listening to it.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.804
You're seeing it.
You're supposed to live it.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.873
Okay, is that what all
of this is about?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.575
That's what all this is.
Sit down.
Mm.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.513
*

08:01.248 --> 08:03.851
Oh, my God, that's me.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.985
That's Candace.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.887
That's Carol...

08:06.920 --> 08:08.856
*

08:17.330 --> 08:19.700
* Listen, Mama...
Where'd you get these, Jamal?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.369
Aunt Carol gave me a whole bunch
of home videos.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.371
* "Strong" would be
an understatement *

08:24.404 --> 08:25.839
* "Warrior" would...

08:25.873 --> 08:29.810
Oh. This-this... sound,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.144
it's-it's on a whole new

08:31.178 --> 08:32.312
level for you.
Yeah?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.047
Yes.
Yeah?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.749
* But you're giving,
you're so special *

08:35.783 --> 08:38.085
Oh, I remember that.
(both laugh)

08:38.118 --> 08:41.989
* It's time to let you know

08:42.022 --> 08:46.026
* There's nothing more precious
in this whole world *

08:46.059 --> 08:51.031
* Than the one I love so much,
my favorite girl *

08:51.064 --> 08:53.366
* Mama, oh, Mama

08:53.400 --> 08:55.703
* Oh, Mama, oh, Mama

08:55.736 --> 08:57.671
* For everything
you've been through *

08:57.705 --> 09:02.042
* There's nothing
that I won't do for you *

09:02.075 --> 09:05.679
* Mama, oh, Mama, oh, Mama

09:05.713 --> 09:10.017
* See, you deserve
the best of what *

09:10.050 --> 09:11.885
* This world can offer you

09:11.919 --> 09:12.886
Your dad seems so cool.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.888
No, no, no. No, no. Stop!

09:14.922 --> 09:16.857
Stop it! Jamal, shut this down.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.726
Shut it down.
Wait...

09:18.759 --> 09:20.060
No, shut it down!
Mom, what is wrong?

09:20.093 --> 09:21.795
(panting) You-you can't...

09:21.829 --> 09:23.396
you can't use those videos.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.566
You had no right
digging that stuff up.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.368
Mom, you and-and Dad
and the whole...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.270
I c-- No, I got to go!
Mom...

09:30.303 --> 09:32.272
just wait...
And don't use
those videos, Jamal!

09:32.305 --> 09:34.041
I'm gonna be late
for Angelo's mama.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.243
Damn!

09:36.276 --> 09:38.646
(indistinct chatter)
(piano playing)

09:40.948 --> 09:42.315
How you doing?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.384
WOMAN: I haven't seen
your mother yet, dear.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.585
(clinking)
Ooh.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.155
She's about
to make her entrance.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.589
(music stops)

09:49.623 --> 09:52.259
(murmuring, shushing)

09:55.328 --> 09:57.230
Everyone knows
that I dislike artifice,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.900
so I'm going
to thank you all in advance

09:59.933 --> 10:03.303
for your very generous
contributions to Angelo's

10:03.336 --> 10:06.073
mayoral campaign.
Please fill out the cards,

10:06.106 --> 10:08.909
place them in the little velvet
bags being passed around

10:08.942 --> 10:10.911
by my staff, and enjoy

10:10.944 --> 10:13.580
the champagne et canapés,
mes amis.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.648
(cheering, chuckling)

10:14.682 --> 10:16.950
(piano playing resumes)

10:18.686 --> 10:20.120
Well done, Mother.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.590
So, where is Cookie Lyon?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.492
Mmm.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.461
Um, I don't know.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.765
Let's give her... a few more
minutes. (clears throat)

10:31.799 --> 10:32.933
You don't know?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.268
I don't. Mother.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.505
Am I to understand that I am

10:38.538 --> 10:40.273
being stood up by this woman?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.875
Mm...

10:41.909 --> 10:43.944
After what the whole
world saw sagging

10:43.977 --> 10:46.847
in that pitiful
little naked photo?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.482
This was to be our
statement to our people

10:49.516 --> 10:51.484
that she's not
that kind of person.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.787
I realize that.
Mmm.

10:53.821 --> 10:58.358
This will never do, child.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.564
*

11:05.733 --> 11:08.168
*

11:16.343 --> 11:17.711
CAROL: Boy, I'm telling you,
these packs are like

11:17.745 --> 11:19.512
84% human.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.348
All you got to do is take 'em

11:21.381 --> 11:22.883
to my homegirl down
in Bed-Stuy,

11:22.916 --> 11:25.185
she will have
your dreads flowin', okay?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.653
Like, down-your-back flowin'.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.588
Down my back?
Yeah.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.324
Uh, now give me a
second so I can talk

11:31.358 --> 11:32.993
to my nephew, please.
Hey, Aunt Carol.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.394
Hi, baby.
Hot damn, Jamal Lyon!

11:34.427 --> 11:36.063
Hey.
What's going on, brother?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.098
This your nephew?
Hi...

11:38.131 --> 11:40.167
Yes, it is.
Goddamn. Can I take a picture?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.568
Okay, wait, wait. No.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.203
Why don't you go get
the Malaysian hair

11:43.236 --> 11:44.905
down on aisle nine?
(man mumbles)

11:44.938 --> 11:46.206
Man, I'm a big--
Come on, go ahead.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.440
Thank you, man.
They got
the pink and the yellow.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.508
Man, I'm a fan, man.
Yo, I appreciate you.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.542
Thank you.
The purple, too. Okay, okay.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.944
And what you bring me?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.545
Okay, who is this?

11:52.579 --> 11:54.247
How you doing?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.682
Hi. I'm Auntie Carol.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.184
Yeah, Aunt Carol...

11:57.217 --> 11:58.618
Ah, he's so cute, okay.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.187
Hey, this is Philip,
Aunt Carol.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.922
He's my, um...
Mmm, mmm!

12:01.955 --> 12:03.623
Never mind, but

12:03.656 --> 12:06.894
you aired me out
with those videos, Aunt Carol.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.228
All right, what's going on?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.530
Oh, man.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.366
Nephew, they're basically
the tea of all teas.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.736
It's the reason why me, Cookie
and Candace be at it so much.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.705
Well, look, I'm trying
to launch my entire album

12:18.738 --> 12:20.107
based on that one song,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.442
so, please.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.977
Why did my mom freak out
like that?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.881
What album?
(laughs)

12:27.915 --> 12:29.116
(rapid clucking)

12:30.750 --> 12:32.285
We been waiting on your ass
since that gay,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.287
bald-headed chick
shot you at the ASAs.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.056
* ...God forbidding
what's forgiven *

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
* This life we living
vibe high never lie *

12:38.125 --> 12:40.093
Bye.
* Try breeze through

12:40.127 --> 12:42.729
* Right by look at me
like the bad guy... *

12:42.762 --> 12:44.731
JAMAL: I just never
seen her like that.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.935
You know? So I get that
it's bad, but I need to know.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.669
I was hoping
she was gonna come clean.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.805
If I tell you, you know
she gonna fight me,

12:51.839 --> 12:54.407
and that bitch can go.
I get it, Aunt Carol.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.278
It goes all the way back to when
Cookie first met Lucious.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.248
Lucious.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.851
(laughter)

13:03.884 --> 13:06.419
(laughing loudly)
Hey, look, uh...

13:06.453 --> 13:08.688
Oh, boy.
Can I have a minute with my man?

13:08.721 --> 13:11.291
You sure he's your man?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.525
Ooh!

13:12.559 --> 13:14.627
Mm-mm.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.795
Go fetch.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.497
Little cheap-ass bag.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.665
Come on, Olive Oil.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.301
You, too.
Oh.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.537
(sighs)

13:24.571 --> 13:28.641
Look, please don't make me
say sorry more than once.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.310
Well, let me hear you say it
for a first time,

13:30.343 --> 13:32.479
before I make any decisions.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.315
I just did.
Oh, and that's not
cutting it, Cookie.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.984
(sighs)
This was a big deal.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.952
I know.
And don't talk over me.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.520
(sighs)

13:40.553 --> 13:42.890
Now, music is to your family
what politics is to mine,

13:42.923 --> 13:44.791
and I respect that.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.994
But you disrespected my mother.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.962
(sighs)
It's not cool.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.298
Okay. I'm sorry.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.734
See? I said it again.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.203
Look, something came up.

13:56.236 --> 14:01.408
Jamal found these
old videos, and...

14:01.441 --> 14:03.310
I can't really...

14:03.343 --> 14:06.179
explain it... right now.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.580
The memories...

14:07.614 --> 14:09.082
It's-it's just...

14:09.116 --> 14:10.250
My father,
th-those images.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.651
I chose Lucious,

14:11.684 --> 14:14.254
and I should have
chosen someone like you.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.363
All right.
(sighs)

14:23.396 --> 14:25.365
Why'd you keep me
out so late?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.234
(scoffs)
I broke my curfew.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.202
Like you wanted to leave.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.104
Come here, give me a kiss.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.413
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I got to go.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.464
I'm sorry, Dad. The girls--
they kept me out longer

14:57.497 --> 14:58.898
than I thought.
No.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.433
I can't do this no more.
You got to go.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.901
Dad.
You got to go.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.437
Dad. No, please.
No, I'm sorry. I--

15:04.471 --> 15:07.107
Guns and money?
I know that's his.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.708
I know this is Lucious!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.277
Dad, look, I'm sorry. I just--

15:10.310 --> 15:12.179
Look, I promise I won't...
I won't see him again.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.248
Baby girl, as much as
it's killing me,

15:15.282 --> 15:17.050
you got to go.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.718
I got two other girls
to think of.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.387
I ain't got time for this.
Dad, I'm sorry.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.589
(sniffles)
(crying):
Please, Dad.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.925
I can't let that boy ruin them
like he ruined you.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.796
Damn, Loretha!

15:29.829 --> 15:31.231
Dad, I'm sorry.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.633
(crying)

15:33.666 --> 15:37.570
(crying):
Dad. Dad, please!

15:37.604 --> 15:40.407
(crying)

15:40.440 --> 15:42.642
(sobbing)
Daddy.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.844
Dad.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.179
Dad, please.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.953
(sighs)

15:59.026 --> 16:00.793
(sighs)

16:02.362 --> 16:04.664
Can I please
just make it up to you?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.334
Can I just take your mother
and you out to dinner?

16:07.367 --> 16:10.670
Um, where does she like to go?
Where's her favorite restaurant?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.339
Is it here?
What does she like to eat?

16:12.372 --> 16:14.274
I'll have the staff make it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.209
Please.
Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.678
Um...

16:21.181 --> 16:23.283
Dinner here.
Okay.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.019
With your boys, all right?
I'll pick the menu.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.955
Yeah, my mother's
big on family, so...

16:28.988 --> 16:31.724
she'll probably like your
sons, especially Andre.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.460
She went to Penn.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.395
So, yeah.
Oh. I didn't know that.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.130
Mm-hmm.
Okay, consider it done.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.132
(plays note)
Done.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.533
(laughter)

16:40.567 --> 16:42.335
You gonna sing
whatever you were singing

16:42.369 --> 16:45.038
to them cheap bitches you was
talking to, grinning all...

16:45.072 --> 16:47.074
(imitates him laughing)
all up in their faces?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.309
They were here
on time, so...
Whatever.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.144
You know I'm crazy.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.246
Come here.
That's not how you hold her.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.581
Give me. I know, baby.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.483
Your daddy's stupid.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.984
And I shouldn't have to beg
y'all to go to dinner.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.487
You haven't begged us.
You yelled at us.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.755
'Cause y'all keep bickering.
'Cause he took my girl!

17:02.789 --> 17:04.023
And now you're taking
my daughter?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.425
Hakeem, you don't want
to dig that up, man.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.428
Hey! Hey!
Look. Shut up!
(baby crying)

17:08.461 --> 17:10.197
I don't ask for much.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.200
Yes, you do. Have you met you?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.102
I'll be there.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.170
When is it?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.206
Tomorrow night,
8:00 p.m. sharp.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.108
Tomorrow night?
Yup.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.709
I can't make it.
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

17:22.742 --> 17:24.511
Andre, I need you!

17:24.544 --> 17:27.614
Okay? Now I never
ask you for nothing.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.282
Please.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.054
I'm sorry I reacted
the way I did.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.056
You know I didn't
do that to hurt you.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.527
I know. It's just...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.395
It brought up a
lot of heavy stuff.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.431
Stuff I thought I buried.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.299
That's all we do
is bury stuff.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.569
This family and its secrets.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.704
Ma, we can't do what Dad did
with Andre and Grandma.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.606
You can talk to me.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.609
If you love me,
you ain't got to lie to me.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.882
Stop. Stop right here.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.718
CANDACE (crying):
Daddy. Daddy.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.220
Please, please,
wake up. Dad!

18:07.254 --> 18:09.122
Dad, wake up...
Candace!

18:09.156 --> 18:10.723
Candace?! Candace,
what happened?!

18:10.757 --> 18:12.058
Daddy had a heart attack.
What happened?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.926
We're gonna go with them
to the hospital.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.928
Okay, come on. Come on!
No.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.997
We are going with them
to the hospital.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.167
You stressed
Daddy out enough.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.834
Go be with Lucious.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.770
That's who you want to be with
anyways, right?

18:23.803 --> 18:27.106
(indistinct radio transmission)

18:27.140 --> 18:29.542
(Cookie crying)

18:35.114 --> 18:36.115
(crying):
Dad...

18:36.149 --> 18:38.551
(siren blaring)

18:40.887 --> 18:42.322
(crying)

18:42.355 --> 18:45.525
Daddy died that night.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.130
It was three days

18:51.164 --> 18:53.866
since he kicked me out.

18:53.900 --> 18:58.271
Me and your father were
holed up in a motel somewhere.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.007
A neighbor had to come get me.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.179
Candace blamed me,
and she was right.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.317
My daddy was my life...

19:10.350 --> 19:13.152
until I met that boy.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.488
Mom...
And after that,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.824
we were all each other had.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.559
Your father and I--

19:19.592 --> 19:22.229
we-we practically
raised each other. I mean,

19:22.262 --> 19:26.065
hustling and surviving together
in the streets.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.900
(laughs)

19:31.204 --> 19:33.673
I don't know what to say.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.145
That's why all roads
lead to Lucious.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.147
For Carol, for Candace,

19:41.180 --> 19:43.416
for all of us.

19:43.450 --> 19:47.053
If you need to use those videos
because they inspire you,

19:47.086 --> 19:51.023
I will let you do that, Jamal,
but I can't watch that mess.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.694
I hear you.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.162
So you gonna show up
for me tomorrow,

19:56.195 --> 19:59.532
help me get my new
man's mama in line?

19:59.566 --> 20:01.334
Look, if it helps you
get over Lucious, I'm there.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.070
I'm already over his ass.
Good.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.506
Might even gonna sit
in-between Hakeem and Andre.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.007
Better wear a helmet.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.809
Put Nessa there.
Ooh!

20:17.284 --> 20:18.685
COOKIE:
Okay, teach me how to be
a society bitch, Candace.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.086
You only got one
night, so there's only

20:20.119 --> 20:21.688
so much I can do.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.190
Damn, you act like I ain't got
no kind of home training.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.092
Come on, it ain't all that.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.094
So fake ass.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.962
You know you ain't nothing
but an Oreo.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.531
(clears her throat)
When you gonna...?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.733
Do you want my help or not?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.968
All right.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.805
Let's start with
the placement.
The what?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.206
That's French
for the little white card

20:40.239 --> 20:41.608
that tells you where to sit.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.975
Girl, forget those cards!

20:43.009 --> 20:44.477
I need you to observe
however I move,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.212
I need to learn
how to conversate.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.080
You know, like, just
watch my mannerisms.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.116
What do I say
to this bougie bitch?

20:50.149 --> 20:52.985
Like, I mean, I shouldn't call
her a bitch. That's his mama.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.389
It's "converse," and don't
talk with your mouth full.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.158
With Angelo's mother being
one of those old-school,

20:59.191 --> 21:01.093
minority, sorority chicks,

21:01.127 --> 21:03.129
you're gonna have
to really come correct.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.964
How you know she in a sorority?

21:04.997 --> 21:06.733
I looked her up online.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.168
She's in the same one
as Coretta Scott King,

21:09.201 --> 21:11.304
Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.773
Ha.
So if you get stuck
for something say,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.241
start quoting one of them.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.344
But I don't know
what they be saying.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.279
I take solace in something
Maya Angelou once said.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.982
"We cannot repair
what we cannot see.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.419
Our souls contain our destiny."

21:26.453 --> 21:29.255
Wait, didn't Beyoncé
say something like that?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.458
Maybe, but it sounds

21:31.491 --> 21:33.660
like something Maya
could have said,

21:33.693 --> 21:35.328
so you're gonna have
to "Melania Trump"

21:35.362 --> 21:36.496
the hell out of this situation.
Ah! No, you didn't!

21:36.529 --> 21:38.665
Yes, snatch
from the best,

21:38.698 --> 21:41.133
'cause let me tell you,
you can't tell me

21:41.167 --> 21:42.669
she didn't copy
off of Michelle.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.170
Oh, bitch took every line,

21:44.203 --> 21:45.972
all of it,
the whole damn thing...

21:46.005 --> 21:47.874
Ladies,

21:47.907 --> 21:51.378
ladies, ladies,
surprise, surprise.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.045
I have a feeling it's not.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.047
What are you doing here,
Lucious?

21:55.081 --> 21:58.284
Well, my boy Giuseppe's just
showing me around the spot.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.820
You know, Big Mike is
getting out of the joint

22:00.853 --> 22:03.022
tomorrow night,
so we decided to throw

22:03.055 --> 22:04.791
a nice little
celebratory party,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.626
take over the rest
of the establishment.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.396
I hope their rowdy asses
ain't too much for

22:09.429 --> 22:13.966
Angelo's highfalutin mama.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.405
(laughs)

22:18.438 --> 22:20.440
*

22:23.443 --> 22:25.678
COOKIE:
As soon as I say the name

22:25.712 --> 22:29.516
Lyon, the place is miraculously
booked tomorrow night.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.050
Le... Le Cirque
has the patio open.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.152
Patio? I am not trying

22:33.185 --> 22:35.522
to sit and dig gnats
out of my teeth all night.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.990
No. Hang up.
It's over.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.092
We'll never find
a place in time.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.430
Lucious has eyes, ears
and tentacles everywhere.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.398
(chuckles softly)
I'm just gonna call Angelo

22:45.432 --> 22:48.067
and tell him it's over.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.102
Tell him his mama
was right about me.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.271
Maybe I'm not
about that life.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.373
If his mama was right,
was our daddy wrong?

22:54.407 --> 22:56.108
(clears throat)

22:56.142 --> 22:58.511
(imitating their father):
Cookie gon' be a star.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.848
Cookie gon' marry a president.
(clears throat)

23:01.881 --> 23:05.351
Cookie gon' be president.
(laughs)

23:05.384 --> 23:08.254
Come on, do this for Daddy.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.122
Loretha, we had plans.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.492
Howard. Maybe
medical school.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.231
(gasps)

23:19.265 --> 23:20.467
I have an idea.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.734
What?

23:21.768 --> 23:24.270
You should
do the dinner here.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.307
Mm-hmm.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.546
I practically have penises

23:33.580 --> 23:35.648
hanging on the walls.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.084
LUCIOUS:
That's not how you
hold your baby.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.819
You don't hold her
in a headlock.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.488
You got to hold her
with her head

23:41.521 --> 23:43.556
close to your chest so she
can hear your heartbeat.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.057
Mom said that's how
you hold a baby.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.593
Your mama's country.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.628
She ain't held a baby
since your were a baby.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.330
Look, um, you're gonna
have to watch Bella

23:51.363 --> 23:53.500
for a couple hours
for me tonight.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.834
What? Me and Bella alone?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.803
You got this. Look,
I have no idea

23:56.836 --> 24:00.006
where Anika went to, but I
know you can handle the baby

24:00.039 --> 24:02.174
even though your mama
think you still a boy.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.676
I'm supposed
to go to Mom's tonight.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.311
You'll get there.

24:05.344 --> 24:08.581
Run into a tight spot,
just... yell for Juanita.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.783
Yeah, I got to go
finish getting ready.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.660
We got this.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.633
*

24:28.801 --> 24:30.770
Okay, guys, when y'all done
rolling that up, make sure y'all

24:30.803 --> 24:33.105
take it in there somewhere.
Be careful with that.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.373
Where they going
with my leopard chairs?

24:34.406 --> 24:36.108
To storage. Diana Dubois

24:36.142 --> 24:38.110
is on the board of PETA.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.446
People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals?
Yeah, well,

24:40.479 --> 24:42.549
I know what the hell it means.
You better go back there

24:42.582 --> 24:44.717
and get those fur coats from
out of there, 'cause she gonna

24:44.751 --> 24:46.619
snatch her own edges out
when she find those.

24:46.653 --> 24:50.322
Porsha, we need some
more silk pillows.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.325
Alexa, will you add yellow silk

24:53.359 --> 24:55.895
pillows to my shopping cart.
Nice ones.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.631
ALEXA: Sure, yellow silk pillows
are now in your cart.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.232
Can you ask Alexa
to get the dumbasses

25:00.266 --> 25:01.534
back up here?
They hung my picture wrong.
Hey.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.002
Hey, guys, come on back, 'cause

25:03.035 --> 25:04.370
it's not right, it's crooked,

25:04.403 --> 25:06.405
and she don't
like it like that.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.874
Okay, three forks?
What you need

25:07.907 --> 25:09.709
the third one for?
Jackie O

25:09.742 --> 25:11.544
had three.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.412
Michelle O
had three.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.247
Cookie Holloway Lyon Dubois...

25:15.281 --> 25:16.583

25:16.616 --> 25:18.484
Okay, whatever.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.687
Uh, Porsha, come back here
and help me.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.023
Alexa, can you help me
find a new job?

25:25.057 --> 25:26.826

25:26.859 --> 25:29.361
Little girl, you got to chill.
Where the hell'd they go?

25:29.395 --> 25:31.598
Here, you take her.
Mm-mmm. I'm good. I possess

25:31.631 --> 25:33.365
none of those skills.
Look, look, you could...

25:33.399 --> 25:34.767
you could call Shine.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.371
What? He raised Nessa,
didn't he?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.207
Why you such
a no-good-idea-having fool?

25:43.075 --> 25:44.711
But you giving me a good idea.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.614
I'm-a call Jamal.
He did have a baby for, like,

25:47.647 --> 25:50.449
two seconds.
See? You see how that work?
I'm-a...

25:50.482 --> 25:51.851
I'm-a go to the kitchen.
You need something?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.886
Breast milk.
All right. I got you.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.801
You're special, Loretha.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.604
You're the one.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.639
You put too much on me, Dad.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.074
I put everything on you.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.436
Hey!
Hey, Ma.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.605
I'm not late, am I? I'm right
on time, right? That's fine.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.308
All right, look, I was working
on your song. It's your song,

26:49.341 --> 26:52.945
It's-it's everything, it's raw,
it's real, it's so... it's dope.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.314
Okay, I can't wait to hear
the song. Why you got shades on?

26:55.347 --> 26:57.149
Boy, are you high?

26:57.183 --> 26:59.919
No. Ma, it's from the new meds.
Come on.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.188
It makes my face a little, I
don't know, my eyes sensitive.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.191
Well, does it
make your brain stupid, huh?

27:05.224 --> 27:07.193
Jamal, you know how important
this night is for me.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.429
Why would you start
new meds tonight?

27:10.462 --> 27:11.931
Mommy...

27:11.964 --> 27:13.866
you're nervous,
and I understand.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.103
But you don't need to be.
I'm good, okay? I swear.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.538
Yo, your place is perfect.
This place is dope.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.507
Please...
Don't worry
about nothing.

27:21.540 --> 27:25.477
Jesus, please stop me
from killing my child tonight.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.546
Aah! God!
(knocking)

27:27.579 --> 27:29.048
Boy, go put some water
on your face.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.349
Get it together!
A'ight! Yeah, yeah, a'ight.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.218
Stupid!

27:40.192 --> 27:41.560
Hello.
Hey.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.963
Come in.
All right.
Here we go.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.065
You look gorgeous.
Thank you.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.301
So, please allow me
to introduce you to my mother.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.837
(clears throat)
Mother, this is Cookie.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.338
Cookie, this is

27:52.371 --> 27:54.340
Diana.
Very nice

27:54.373 --> 27:55.407
to meet you.
Mm.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.809
Lovely decor, Cookie.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.044
Thank you.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.546
But really, you shouldn't have.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.348
Mother...
I-I shouldn't have?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.550
No, you didn't
have to redo your entire place

28:04.583 --> 28:07.486
just to impress me.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.255
I do adore Mondrian, though.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.522
JAMAL:
I, for one,

28:10.556 --> 28:12.058
do not even
want to know you

28:12.091 --> 28:13.893
if you do not
love Mondrian.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.594
Mrs. Dubois, you
are everything.

28:15.627 --> 28:16.863
My name is Jamal.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.931
Hey... What...
Oh. She smell good.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.233
This is my son Jamal.
She's incredible.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.035
Jamal, come here, why don't you
make yourself useful?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.838
Here, here, boy.
Best to shut your mouth.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.340
Oh, yeah.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.376
(chuckles)
That's, um...

28:30.409 --> 28:32.278
Mom...
That's my middle son

28:32.311 --> 28:35.247
Uh, he-he's a free spirit.
Mm-hmm.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.784
One in every family.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.551
Uh, no,
there isn't, Mother,

28:39.585 --> 28:42.221
but if-if there were
more Jamals around,

28:42.254 --> 28:43.923
the-the world
would be a better place.

28:43.956 --> 28:47.226
That's for sure.
Yes.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.295
(whispers): Don't try too hard
honey, it'll backfire

28:49.328 --> 28:50.362
in your face.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.765
(chuckles softly)

28:52.799 --> 28:55.401
Uh... well, I can't wait
(clears throat)

28:55.434 --> 28:57.136
till you meet my eldest son.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.270
Mm-hmm.
Andre.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.239
He should be here
in a minute.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.141
He went to... he went to Penn.
He went to Penn.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.742
Yes, so you'll have
a lot to talk about.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.878
Very intelligent.
And my baby, Hakeem.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.746
(knocking)
We are so proud of him.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.381
So, Hakeem talking about
he can't come.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.716
'Cause he's
talking about he's

29:10.749 --> 29:11.951
all the way at home by himself.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.053
Get the door.
Get the door.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.755
(crying)
Can't pick up the phone, dummy.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.760
Uh... Hakeem.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.729
Hey, Mom.
Hakeem...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.564
(whispers):
...what the hell is going on?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.266
Give her to me,
give her to me.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.335
Look, I don't want to hear it.
You were right.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.003
Can you just please
make her stop crying?

29:31.037 --> 29:32.404
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...
HAKEEM: What's up?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.772
Hey, Hakeem,
this is my mother.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.674
(clears throat)
Mother, this is Hakeem.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.609
How you doing?

29:37.643 --> 29:39.645
Hello.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.714
(Jamal chuckles)

29:43.715 --> 29:46.785
* Uh

29:46.819 --> 29:48.487
* (whoops)

29:48.520 --> 29:50.689
* Y'all gon' make me
lose my mind *

29:50.722 --> 29:53.259
* Up in here, up in here

29:53.292 --> 29:55.261
* Y'all gon' make me
go all out *

29:55.294 --> 29:57.429
* Up in here, up in here

29:57.463 --> 29:59.531
* Y'all gon' make me

29:59.565 --> 30:01.433
Gangsta.
ALL: Hoo!

30:01.467 --> 30:03.602
We here today to celebrate
the life of Stone Parker.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.037
ALL:
Stone!

30:05.071 --> 30:07.506
Six years gone
and snatched too soon.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.141
Now, we standing

30:09.175 --> 30:10.476
in one of the first buildings

30:10.509 --> 30:12.278
that he and I
ever bought together.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.679
But look at us now.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.514
We own this block and 20
more just like it.

30:15.547 --> 30:16.782
Gangsta.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.950
ALL: Hoo!

30:17.984 --> 30:18.951
Now, let's raise a glass

30:18.985 --> 30:21.320
to our friend,
our soldier,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.489
Stone Parker.
ALL: Stone!

30:23.522 --> 30:25.157
Now let's have a party.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.894
* Lets add up all the factors:
you wack, you're twisted *

30:27.927 --> 30:30.229
* Your girl's a (whoops) but I'm
not him, a'ight, slim? *

30:30.262 --> 30:32.331
Hey.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.233
You looking for Andre?

30:34.266 --> 30:36.068
He ain't gonna show up.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.636
All right, now.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.138
Look around you.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.506
This is your family.

30:40.539 --> 30:41.974
This where you belong.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.844
This is...
this is sanctified.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.746
Now, you know any one
of these boys will kill

30:47.779 --> 30:49.916
or die for you,
right here, right now.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.517
And you know that.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.653
This where you belong.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.555
Looks like he made his choice.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.857
* Think that you Superman,
I got the Kryptonite... *

30:58.891 --> 31:01.928
Come on, let's have a party.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.562
Enough of that.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.597
Stone!
ALL: Stone!

31:11.770 --> 31:13.906
Where's the child's mother?
I don't be keeping tabs on her

31:13.940 --> 31:15.274
like that.
Oh, I see.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.743
Another free spirit?

31:17.776 --> 31:21.447
Following the example
you were given, no doubt.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.549
Mother.
Mrs. Dubois,
you be mad shady,

31:23.582 --> 31:25.918
and I catch that,
I clock that.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.286
Jamal, Jamal, shut up.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.955
Here, boy,
take your baby.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.789
Um, everyone,
please have a seat.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.292
The bouillabaisse
will be served now.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.461
What... Wait, wait, wait,
hold up.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.063
Did-did I fail
to tell you that my mother

31:37.096 --> 31:39.065
is deathly allergic
to-to seafood?

31:39.098 --> 31:40.866
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.269
Our whole dinner lived
at the bottom of the ocean.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.271
Cookie, no.
(doorbell rings)

31:45.304 --> 31:47.573
Oh, Andre.
Coo--

31:49.775 --> 31:51.043
Where the hell are they?

31:51.077 --> 31:52.511
JAMAL: Oh, my lord.
Hakeem!

31:54.313 --> 31:55.647
Give me my child, please.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.249
Come to Mama.
What the hell

31:57.283 --> 31:59.818
is wrong with you,
taking a baby out of the house

31:59.851 --> 32:01.487
without telling
some damn body?

32:01.520 --> 32:04.323
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Lucious Lyon.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.592
Cookie's ex-husband.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.128
That woman right there
is my wife Anika.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.830
She just gave birth
to my granddaughter, my son's

32:11.863 --> 32:13.599
baby mama.
I know, it's crazy.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.167
He somehow got
her pregnant

32:15.201 --> 32:18.770
during the time
he was proposing to his fiancée

32:18.804 --> 32:20.006
and getting left
at the damn altar.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.840
Lucious.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.309
What?

32:23.342 --> 32:24.810
I got to raise that damn baby,

32:24.843 --> 32:25.978
the same way
I had to raise

32:26.012 --> 32:27.413
all these kids,
'cause she

32:27.446 --> 32:29.581
was spending
17 years in prison.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.350
Dad, don't, don't.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.919
Why don't you chill and
live your life. Exist.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.155
Look at you over
here, talking.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.156
You looking a little crispy

32:37.189 --> 32:39.025
around the edges.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.460
I see you've met the gay one,

32:41.493 --> 32:42.961
and you've met
the irresponsible one.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.196
Where's Andre at?

32:44.230 --> 32:46.365
Where's the crazy one?

32:46.398 --> 32:49.635
* Just like Uniblab,
robotic kicking flab *

32:49.668 --> 32:51.837
* My flavor bidder badder
chitter-chatter *

32:51.870 --> 32:53.505
* Madder than the Mad Hatter

32:53.539 --> 32:55.807
* Data to turn your body
into anti-matter *

32:55.841 --> 32:58.277
* And just like a piece
of Sizzlean *

32:58.310 --> 33:00.312
* You'll fit inside my stomach
with the eggs and grits *

33:00.346 --> 33:01.847
* Between

33:01.880 --> 33:02.981
* The king is what I mean,

33:03.015 --> 33:04.616
* I mean, my man get a cup

33:04.650 --> 33:06.452
* And put some change
inside your hand *

33:06.485 --> 33:08.954
* Now hold up,
let's make this official *

33:08.987 --> 33:11.357
* Everybody let's agree
that MCs need a tissue *

33:11.390 --> 33:13.159
* The funk's my only issue

33:13.192 --> 33:14.893
* I bet your mama miss you

33:14.926 --> 33:17.029
* And I bet the Mack they go
up like an MX missile *

33:17.063 --> 33:19.131
* No more of your whinin'
on the charts climbin' *

33:19.165 --> 33:21.367
* As I make the funk,
kickin' out more harder... *

33:21.400 --> 33:23.135
I'm not rapping.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.003
It's your choice.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.406
Just like it was your choice
to pull that trigger.

33:27.439 --> 33:31.043
You can choose to use your voice
and pick yourself up or not.

33:31.077 --> 33:35.347
Your choice to run forever
or stop and stand up.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.816
* Time for new flava
in ya ear *

33:37.849 --> 33:40.852
* I'm kickin' new flava
in ya ear *

33:40.886 --> 33:43.555
* Mack's the brand new flava
in ya ear *

33:43.589 --> 33:45.891
* Craig Mack, 1,000 degrees

33:45.924 --> 33:47.426
* You'll be on your knees

33:47.459 --> 33:49.161
* And you'll be burning,
begging please *

33:49.195 --> 33:51.163
* Brother, freeze,
this man's undisputed *

33:51.197 --> 33:54.066
* In deep rooted funk smoke
that leaves your brains booted *

33:54.100 --> 33:57.536
* This bad MC with stamina
like Bruce Jenner *

33:57.569 --> 33:59.238
* The winner,
tasting MC's for dinner *

33:59.271 --> 34:02.408
* You're crazy like that glue
to think that *

34:02.441 --> 34:03.609
* You could outdo
my one two... *

34:03.642 --> 34:05.077
(sighs)
You came.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.878
Yeah, yeah.
I brought Freda.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.115
Yeah.
I want you to know

34:09.148 --> 34:11.383
I'm good for my word, but...

34:11.417 --> 34:13.051
I got to go.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.421
Okay? I promised my mom
that I'd be there...
You can't...

34:15.454 --> 34:17.189
I promised my mom I'd
be there for her tonight.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.458
Andre, this is a
special night for me.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.059
This means a lot to me.

34:21.093 --> 34:23.562
And I invited you so
that you could be here

34:23.595 --> 34:25.231
with the rest of my family.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.967
So it would mean a lot to
me if you actually stayed.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.271
* I'm kickin' new flava
in ya ear *

34:32.304 --> 34:33.939
* Mack's the brand new flava
in ya ear *

34:33.972 --> 34:37.209
* Here comes the brand new flava
in ya ear *

34:37.243 --> 34:38.777
(sighs)

34:38.810 --> 34:40.379
How y'all doin'?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.348
Y'all know what Stone was to me.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.217
He was more like a father
than a brother.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.552
So this is for the man

34:46.585 --> 34:49.054
that we love,
the man that we lost,

34:49.087 --> 34:52.057
and... for the family
that we gained.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.825
MAN:
Stone!

34:53.859 --> 34:55.827
ALL:
Stone!

34:55.861 --> 34:58.029
*

35:08.640 --> 35:12.244
* Hard as a rock

35:12.278 --> 35:15.181
* Cold as Philly's winter

35:15.214 --> 35:18.083
* When you're left out
in these streets y'all *

35:18.116 --> 35:21.820
* You were the
king of the block *

35:21.853 --> 35:23.422
* You were shot

35:23.455 --> 35:26.292
* It was oh, so senseless

35:26.325 --> 35:30.662
* Oh, how I miss my brother,
brother *

35:30.696 --> 35:33.031
* Oh, no

35:33.064 --> 35:35.834
* Left me alone

35:35.867 --> 35:38.337
* With so much potential

35:38.370 --> 35:41.106
* No wonder I miss you

35:41.139 --> 35:43.375
* It's okay

35:43.409 --> 35:46.378
* I got a new home

35:46.412 --> 35:49.014
* I found me a family

35:49.047 --> 35:52.150
* Right here in this alley

35:52.184 --> 35:54.520
* I'm like, Hey, oh

35:54.553 --> 35:58.724
* I only made it this far
with a heart a stone *

35:58.757 --> 36:01.159
* No one can break this
heart of stone *

36:01.193 --> 36:02.961
* No one can break this

36:02.994 --> 36:06.064
* I'm like, hey, oh

36:06.097 --> 36:08.900
* I only made it this far
with a heart a stone *

36:08.934 --> 36:11.002
* No one can break this
heart of stone *

36:11.036 --> 36:12.838
* This one's for my King...

36:19.378 --> 36:21.480
(whistles)
All right, look,

36:21.513 --> 36:25.251
if your name is not Dubois
or Lyon, get the hell out.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.418
Take the damn fish with you.

36:26.452 --> 36:27.586
Just go.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.720
LUCIOUS:
Cookie, don't do that.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.088
(sighs)

36:30.121 --> 36:33.191
Thank y'all.
Thank you, thank you, get out.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.160
Lucious and Anika.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.728
Sit down.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.196
Hakeem, go get that

36:38.230 --> 36:40.732
peach cobbler for me,
out of the kitchen.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.634
And I got some Cold Duck
to wash it down.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.505
Yeah, this...

36:46.538 --> 36:48.907
this is my family.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.743
Well,
most of them, anyway.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.579
But, uh, yeah.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.248
We are a twisted tree,

36:56.282 --> 36:58.049
but I wouldn't trade

36:58.083 --> 36:59.751
one gay, one high,

36:59.785 --> 37:01.720
one low, one crazy,

37:01.753 --> 37:03.221
one lazy branch of it.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.556
This is who we are.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.858
Take it or leave it.
Jamal, sing us a song.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.560
That's what we do
around here.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.028
(chuckles)
We celebrate who we are.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.264
JAMAL:
I actually do have something.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.765
Mm-hmm.
I've been working on it all day.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.267
It's a song about my mother.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.569
Song about me.
(scoffs)

37:17.603 --> 37:18.870
(laughs)

37:18.904 --> 37:21.507
*

37:30.081 --> 37:31.983
* Listen, Mama

37:32.017 --> 37:34.886
* So many words
to describe you *

37:34.920 --> 37:37.623
* Strong would be
an understatement *

37:37.656 --> 37:41.427
* Warrior would suit you
so much better *

37:41.460 --> 37:43.762
* 'Cause you've been fighting

37:43.795 --> 37:47.132
* She was just turning 16

37:47.165 --> 37:49.568
* Daddy left her out
in the cold streets *

37:49.601 --> 37:51.337
* He wasn't having it
Daddy, please.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.071
* He found all her sins

37:53.104 --> 37:57.242
* Underneath her mattress

37:57.275 --> 37:59.110
* Then suddenly

37:59.144 --> 38:02.848
* Her daddy up and died

38:02.881 --> 38:04.783
* But still she's her father

38:04.816 --> 38:07.486
* There in Lucious' eyes

38:07.519 --> 38:09.355
* Mama

38:09.388 --> 38:12.023
* Oh, Mama

38:12.057 --> 38:15.794
* For everything
you been through *

38:15.827 --> 38:18.797
* There's nothing
that I won't do for you *

38:18.830 --> 38:21.967
(laughter)
* Mama

38:22.000 --> 38:23.602
* Oh, Mama

38:23.635 --> 38:27.873
* See, you deserve the best of

38:27.906 --> 38:31.042
* What this world
can offer to you *

38:31.076 --> 38:33.379
* Mama, I love you

38:33.412 --> 38:36.382
* Mama, Mama, Mama,
I do love you *

38:36.415 --> 38:39.284
* Mama, I love you

38:39.317 --> 38:41.387
* Mama, Mama

38:42.821 --> 38:44.956
This is the music
I was talking about.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.058
I'm coming back.

38:47.092 --> 38:51.463
* She gave it all
so unselfishly *

38:51.497 --> 38:53.832
* And she did it all
just for loyalty *

38:53.865 --> 38:57.302
* That's my Mama

38:57.335 --> 39:01.807
* I never knew someone
to sacrifice *

39:01.840 --> 39:03.174
* Everything for love

39:03.208 --> 39:07.546
* Even gave up
their whole lives *

39:08.780 --> 39:12.183
* Oh, Mama

39:12.217 --> 39:15.721
* For everything
you been through *

39:15.754 --> 39:19.991
* Nothing that I won't do
for you *

39:20.025 --> 39:22.394
* Oh, Mama

39:23.862 --> 39:26.998
* See you deserve the best of

39:27.032 --> 39:30.602
* What this world can offer

39:30.636 --> 39:32.037
* To you.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.540
(door closing)

39:34.573 --> 39:36.575
(laughing)

39:57.896 --> 40:00.265
I can tell you've
gone above and beyond

40:00.298 --> 40:02.267
to try to impress me.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.603
But my blood ain't blue.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.237
My granddaddy
was a bootlegger.

40:06.271 --> 40:07.639
His daddy was a smuggler.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.475
Mm.
(laughs)

40:09.508 --> 40:12.578
Now, we managed to
scrub ourselves clean,

40:12.611 --> 40:16.482
but you and your family remind
me of where we came from.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.050
I see why

40:19.084 --> 40:21.219
Angelo's attracted to you.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.156
You got fire in you.

40:25.190 --> 40:29.995
You just make sure that fire
doesn't burn my child.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.231
My only child.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.768
Ooh, and don't imagine I
didn't see that lambskin jacket

40:36.802 --> 40:39.471
stuffed in the back
of your closet.

40:39.505 --> 40:42.407
Uh... busted.
(laughs)

40:42.440 --> 40:43.809
Busted? Who's busted?
Yeah. Me.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.110
Your mama... she, uh...

40:45.143 --> 40:47.679
(laughing)
Well...

40:47.713 --> 40:50.181
You ready?
Oh, yes.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.117
Good night, Cookie.
Good night.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.952
Oh, and the cobbler was
delicious, by the way.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.121
Thank you.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.859
(sighs)

41:00.892 --> 41:03.194
Well, you did good.
(chuckles)

41:03.228 --> 41:05.931
I think maybe
I should come over

41:05.964 --> 41:07.999
a little bit later...

41:08.033 --> 41:10.802
and just show you
how good you did.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.203
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.373
You go tuck your mama in,
and you come back,

41:15.406 --> 41:17.375
and then you tuck me in.
I'm gonna do that.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.844
(giggling):
Stop. She is out there.
Oh.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.045
Stop it.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.248
(laughing):
Behave.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.384
(sighs)

41:32.858 --> 41:34.860
*

41:55.446 --> 41:57.448
*

42:00.418 --> 42:02.087
Freda.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.031
You know what?
I, um...

42:13.064 --> 42:14.766
I didn't know Stone.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.368
But I know rocks like Stone.

42:17.402 --> 42:21.106
My father, Frank Gathers,
he was one of 'em.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.008
I've got to thank

42:23.041 --> 42:25.243
Andre Lyon for reminding me

42:25.276 --> 42:27.178
that even though
my rock is gone,

42:27.212 --> 42:29.180
I still got a voice
and a choice.

42:29.214 --> 42:32.383
Today, I'm choosing
to fight over flight.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.622
* Yeah

42:36.655 --> 42:39.591
* Now I had to say my good byes
to a real good man *

42:39.625 --> 42:42.728
* A deep painful feeling that
I never wanna feel again *

42:42.761 --> 42:45.530
* Thought my pops prolly take
more care of his fam man *

42:45.563 --> 42:48.299
* But all he looked out for
was Mike, Guy and Bam Bam *

42:48.333 --> 42:50.568
* No lying, then I thought
I had a family with the Lyons *

42:50.602 --> 42:53.639
* But they seemed more like
wolves the more I realized *

42:53.672 --> 42:56.474
* Time to cut my ties, save
that drama for someone else *

42:56.507 --> 42:58.977
* My pops left me with only
memories and nothing else *

42:59.010 --> 43:01.880
* Still he was more than a dad
more like a king to me *

43:01.913 --> 43:04.449
* Family provider I needed it
he would bring it to me *

43:04.482 --> 43:05.817
* I thought he had it all

43:05.851 --> 43:07.085
* Now he's gonna
and ain't leave to me *

43:07.118 --> 43:08.419
* Swear sometimes it feel like

43:08.453 --> 43:10.588
* It's all just a bad dream
to me *

43:10.622 --> 43:12.958
* My family is these streets
* Streets, yeah

43:12.991 --> 43:15.126
* Family's over everything

43:15.160 --> 43:17.729
* We do it for each other we do
it for one another while I *

43:17.763 --> 43:20.832
* Do it for my father you doing
it for your brother, yeah *
