01:49.776 --> 01:53.237
Hold it. Watch it, watch it.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.573
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.826
- Got it. Got it.
- Thank you.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.037
On your shoulder,
put it on your shoulder.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.289
- Watch the step.
- Watch the step.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.375
Easy, easy.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.710
If you need some help
down there, say something.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.462
- Watch it.
- Keep it coming.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.464
- Don't go too fast.
- Easy.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.174
Whoa, whoa. whoa.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.469
That's it, come on.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.013
You hit me in the foot.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.933
Watch the car.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.103
- The car's right here.
- That's it.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.027
Watch where you step.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.075
Oh, man.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.994
Rusty?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.705
What was Rusty's last name?

02:45.498 --> 02:47.833
Tomasky.

02:48.293 --> 02:52.254
He got me in with the band.
I'm a roadie.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.965
What were you doing
in Twin Peaks?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.676
We were supposed to play a gig
in Knife River,

02:57.844 --> 03:01.138
but a tire on the van crapped out.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.348
Then you met someone.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.602
Yeah, this guy...
This guy came out of the woods,

03:06.769 --> 03:09.062
like Bigfoot or something,

03:09.230 --> 03:12.941
and he was wearing a weird suit.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.693
And we talked to him for a while

03:14.861 --> 03:20.240
and he said he had some brew,
you know, would we like some?

03:20.408 --> 03:23.202
So Rusty went with him.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.913
I didn't see him after that.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.542
We'll need to get in touch
with Rusty's parents.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.379
Heh. He hated his parents.

03:34.589 --> 03:41.178
He's staying with his uncle
in Moses Lake until we were gonna...

03:41.346 --> 03:43.305
We were gonna move.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.474
We were gonna move to L.A.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.109
Andy.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.989
Ow, my foot! Watch it.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.034
He's taken another pawn, Harry,

04:04.577 --> 04:06.328
but he didn't tell us his move.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.332
Windom Earle's
playing off the board.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.884
- Morning, Lucy.
- Morning, Sheriff Truman.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.427
- Morning, Lucy.
- Agent Cooper.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.721
Deputy Hawk is in your office,
sheriff.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.598
He's with somebody
I've never seen before,

04:26.766 --> 04:30.602
but he looks really sad,
so Hawk is feeding him breakfast.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.648
Andy.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.071
Yes, Lucy?

04:41.781 --> 04:44.366
What do you know
about saving our planet?

04:44.575 --> 04:46.410
I know it's in a lot of trouble.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.580
Andy, I'm taking fate
into my own hands.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.334
Mostly because the suspense
is too much for me.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.088
Tomorrow is D-day. Dad Day.

04:58.631 --> 05:03.885
In 24 hours,
I will choose the father of my child.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.762
Deputy Andy Brennan

05:06.347 --> 05:10.267
or clothing salesman
Richard Tremayne.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.689
What does that have to do
with the Miss Twin Peaks contest?

05:15.898 --> 05:20.861
I... I mean, we could use
the money.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.863
We could also use a father.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.908
So I have to make a speech
about saving our planet,

05:27.076 --> 05:28.618
which is a great concept,

05:28.786 --> 05:32.331
but I have no idea
how to go about it.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.790
Yet.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.337
I do know that people have got to stop
sinking their beer cans in Pearl Lake

05:38.546 --> 05:39.588
when they're fishing.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.215
Oh. Beer cans.

05:42.425 --> 05:47.721
And, um, Styrofoam never dies
for as long as you live.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.433
It doesn't?

06:05.281 --> 06:07.991
- Randy, has Audrey returned?
- No, sir.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.286
- No messages from her?
- No, sir.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.455
Would you send someone up
for my bags, please?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.207
Certainly.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.968
The insurance companies
send me so many forms

06:27.136 --> 06:30.305
that I could get a heart attack
just lifting them.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.891
You're fine.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.979
It's what's in your heart
you should be worried about.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.693
I know that I have given you
reason to doubt me.

06:44.779 --> 06:49.491
But I am only interested in doing
the right thing for everybody.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.493
Then stay away from Eileen.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.495
I can't.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.873
Not as long as the lie survives.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.502
Damn it, Ben. It's not that simple.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.129
I believe you.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.758
I applaud your desire
to do the right thing.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.971
But goodness in you is...
It's like a time bomb.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.351
There's nothing good
about ruined lives.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.230
It is a confusing
and difficult process.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.275
But I must continue.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.862
Sorry, Will.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.117
Ah. Excuse me. Mm.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.662
- Jack, come on in.
- Hi.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.372
You know Will Hayward?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.709
Yes, hello. I've met your daughter.
She's a lovely girl.

07:40.877 --> 07:45.088
I should be getting back
to my office.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.885
Nice to see you again, John.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.975
Ben, be careful, please.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.232
I've been looking for Audrey.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.152
Oh. She should be back any minute.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.529
Ben, I gotta go.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.239
They're gassing up the jet
as we speak.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.743
Well, you can call her
when you get to wherever it is

08:14.911 --> 08:17.245
you are in such a hurry to get to.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.581
A friend of mine...

08:20.124 --> 08:22.918
He was more than a friend. He was
a partner.... he's been murdered.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.272
Female child.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.027
Mother, Eileen Hayward.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.405
Daughter, Donna Marie.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.242
Father...

09:10.341 --> 09:13.343
Donna? Donna, where are you?

09:13.511 --> 09:14.636
What is it, Mom?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.556
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.099
I'll be right there.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.643
He says it's important.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.160
- Ms. Horne, I have several messages.
- Great.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.037
I'll take that for you.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.291
Okay. Thanks.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.750
Audrey.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.254
Agent Cooper would like to see you
at the sheriff's station.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.340
Oh, well, I have a lot of work to do.
Maybe this afternoon.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.051
Now. It's important.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.470
Okay.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.517
But what about Stop Ghostwood?

10:02.685 --> 10:05.186
How am I supposed
to get ahold of you?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.230
I need more time.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.816
A brave man is dead.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.612
He's my friend,
and I have to take his place.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.572
You aren't coming back, are you?

10:18.743 --> 10:21.745
Damn this rainforest business
anyway.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.496
You can handle this without me.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.499
I don't know.
I'm afraid that I'm weak.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.670
Ben Horne, weak?
I find that hard to believe.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.548
Strive for goodness, huh?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.259
Tell the hardest truth first.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.136
Just do the best you can.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.888
That's all you really can do.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.348
Hmm.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.602
Well, I'm sorry
that Audrey wasn't here.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.984
I want you to give her
something for me.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.446
Tell her I...

10:58.032 --> 10:59.532
Just give it to her, will you?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.664
Good luck.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.458
See if any
of these symbols have to do

11:08.626 --> 11:10.919
with harvest schedules
or ancient calendars.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.712
Look for any curious nomenclature.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.589
Got it, chief.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.052
Good work, Cappy.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.429
- Major. How goes the battle?
- Harry.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.556
- Agent Cooper.
- Major, you look bushed.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.686
Well, I spent the night obtaining and
perusing the Project Blue Book files

11:27.853 --> 11:29.354
regarding Windom Earle.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.439
I found it impossible to sleep after.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.274
What have you gleaned?

11:33.442 --> 11:36.319
Earle was the best
and brightest among us.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.488
But when our attention
turned from outer space

11:38.656 --> 11:40.740
to the wooded areas
surrounding Twin Peaks,

11:40.908 --> 11:42.909
he became destructively obsessive.

11:43.452 --> 11:47.497
Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.334
Possessive of his assignments,
finally violent.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.628
He was removed from the project.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.173
I found this in the project archives.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.595
These... These evil sorcerers,
dugpas, they're called,

12:02.763 --> 12:06.349
they cultivate evil for the sake of evil,
nothing else.

12:06.517 --> 12:10.895
They express themselves
in darkness for darkness

12:11.063 --> 12:13.523
without leavening motive. Uh...

12:13.691 --> 12:18.278
Now, this... This ardent purity
allows them to access a secret place

12:18.446 --> 12:21.781
where the cultivation of evil proceeds
in exponential fashion,

12:21.949 --> 12:26.286
and with it, the furtherance
of evil's resulting power.

12:26.495 --> 12:31.416
This place of power is tangible,
and as such, it can be found, entered

12:31.584 --> 12:34.210
and perhaps utilized
in some fashion.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.963
The dugpas have many names
for it,

12:37.131 --> 12:42.302
but chief among them, ahem, is the...
Is the Black Lodge.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.388
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I'm mad.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.557
Overworked.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.809
Go away.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.737
Gentlemen, when Windom Earle
arrived in Twin Peaks,

13:00.905 --> 13:03.364
I assumed
he had come for vengeance.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.991
For me.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.826
But I miscalculated.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.413
He has insinuated himself
into the lives of people I care for.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.124
He has murdered innocents.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.711
He has engaged us in subterfuge
and red herring.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.546
A fish I don't particularly care for.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.633
But all of these acts
are merely camouflage.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.677
He's been after something else
all along:

13:24.845 --> 13:27.305
the Black Lodge.

13:27.848 --> 13:34.145
Fellas, we need to find out what this,
the Black Lodge, has to do with that.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.025
Do you really believe
there's a connection?

13:40.528 --> 13:41.945
Windom Earle does, Harry.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.456
All right. Harry, we're gonna go
through these files from top to bottom.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.210
Cappy, I want you to dig up
everything you can about the dugpas.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.963
Major,
I think you'd better hit the sack.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.048
I could use a good stretch.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.050
Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my mind.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.135
Good idea.
Don't forget the bread crumbs.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.554
Right.

14:08.722 --> 14:13.059
Harry, let's do it.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.107
You know, Leo, the only thing
that Columbus discovered

14:19.275 --> 14:20.316
was that he was lost.

14:22.444 --> 14:26.155
Cooper and the gang
haven't even left the snide yet.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.951
I know something they don't know.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.746
I know something
young Dale merely suspects.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.665
Project Blue Book.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.960
Little men,
pewits loaded with optimism. Heh.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.964
They were a deterrent so slight
it was practically encouragement.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.968
Yet I would like to ask Major Briggs
a question or three.

14:47.136 --> 14:51.681
Polish up that bald nub of his
and see what shines.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.481
Perhaps, Leo, we too
should venture out for a good stretch.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.735
Wouldn't it be fun to have
a Project Blue Book reunion?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.029
Wine, cheese, talk about old times,

15:06.196 --> 15:09.699
trade hilarious anecdotes
of the good old days.

15:09.992 --> 15:14.162
I wonder what amongst my detritus
I can use to spice up Briggs' life.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.040
Leo, stop dawdling.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.460
If you were outside,
you'd have trouble with pigeons.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.224
"And that's the only way
we're ever going to save the trees.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.686
It's time to stand up and kick some butt
for our environment.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.731
Before it's too late for all of us."

15:43.651 --> 15:45.902
It's beautiful, letter-perfect.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.406
I don't know about
the "kick butt" part.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.826
How about, um, "fight"?

15:53.994 --> 15:56.788
It's time to stand up
and fight for our environment.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.790
Much better.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.168
Shelly, I've been thinking.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.587
Oh, Bobby, I know, I know, I know.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.299
- The speech counts double...
- Forget about the contest.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.009
I've been thinking about us.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.262
You have?

16:14.515 --> 16:19.268
I know that I have not been paying
the right kind of attention to you lately.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.939
I got busy with Mr. Horne.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.192
I started wearing suits, okay,
and suddenly I'm walking around

16:26.360 --> 16:28.653
like I'm more important
than everybody else.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.489
You were pretty crummy.

16:35.411 --> 16:39.706
Bobby, I've missed you.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.835
I've missed all the things
we used to do together.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.342
When I saw you kissing that guy,
whew, something snapped.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.013
It was like my brain rolled over,

16:55.180 --> 17:00.059
and I could see all the stuff
that was special to me.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.395
All the stuff that matters.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.899
I love you, Shelly.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.778
And I wanna spend my time
with that.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.781
I mean, you know,
if that's okay with you,

17:13.949 --> 17:16.784
I'd like to do that, you know...

17:18.746 --> 17:22.749
Bobby, what do you think?

17:31.300 --> 17:32.925
Lucky.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.303
Lucky me.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.556
Shelly, telephone.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.226
Agent Cooper's on the line.
He needs to talk to you.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.730
Now, Shelly. He says it's important.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.294
- I've got great news.
- What?

18:08.545 --> 18:13.341
It's going to be Norma Jennings
and Richard Tremayne.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.594
Tremayne is the third judge.
It's in the bag.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.930
Well, now, I have to be sure.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.015
Baby, I have to be sure
I'm gonna win.

18:21.183 --> 18:27.146
Oh, my God, this guy's British
or Bahamian or something.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.482
He's bound to fall for your charms.

18:29.650 --> 18:35.613
We'll find some way
to get you two together, alone.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.741
And then
you put on a dress with a slit.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.703
Oh, the slit cut halfway
up to Seattle.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.543
And then nestle in real close to him,

18:48.710 --> 18:52.213
and when he gets a look
at those gams

18:52.381 --> 18:58.719
and smells that French perfume
dripping off you and then

18:59.513 --> 19:05.852
becomes lost
in those brown eyes, oh...

19:06.019 --> 19:08.688
Mm, mm, mm.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.190
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.359
Stop it, you vixen, you.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.611
I can't stand it anymore.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.905
Why can't we just elope and?

19:18.073 --> 19:22.243
- No. Now, not until I've won, darling.
- Oh.

19:22.411 --> 19:26.497
Then, and only then,
I will marry you.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.332
Oh...

19:29.084 --> 19:31.627
Oh, you're so strict, darling.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.921
And I am the blasted mayor.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.674
Oh, now, baby, come here.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.468
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.678
It's okay.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.933
Each of you received
a piece of this poem.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.353
Each in a curious manner,
along with this invitation.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.690
We all went to the Roadhouse.
Nobody showed up.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.195
Have any of you had
contact recently with a stranger?

19:57.362 --> 20:03.284
Someone who struck you as peculiar,
personable or just plain puzzling?

20:04.119 --> 20:07.997
Well, there was this strange guy who
said he was a friend of my father's.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.375
Same day I got the poem,
I got a $10 tip for a cup of coffee.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.669
That's unusual.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.005
You know, there was a funny old guy
at the library.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.299
He asked me
to read the poem to him.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.468
All three.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.262
Shelly, take a closer look.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.890
Does this handwriting
look familiar to you?

20:30.103 --> 20:31.938
It's Leo's.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.358
Listen carefully.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.111
I want each of you to check in
with the sheriff twice a day.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.782
Nine o'clock in the morning,
9:00 at night.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.744
I want your parents
to know your whereabouts at all times.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.414
You walk to school,
you drive to work,

20:50.582 --> 20:53.668
make sure
that you do not do so alone.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.339
Please believe me
when I tell you to be very careful.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.633
You're in danger.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.678
We all are.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.900
Heh. You would've
appreciated the dugpas, Leo.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.821
Ancient sorcerers bent on evil.
Ha-ha-ha.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.699
Rather like the Kali worshippers
in India.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.076
Another fine bunch of zanies,
I can tell you.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.161
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.750
Those were the good old days.

21:35.127 --> 21:40.047
- Shelly.
- Very good, Leo, you remember.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.508
Tawdry little trollop.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.010
Shelly.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.220
Just between you and me, old boy,

21:46.388 --> 21:50.641
your wife has some
fairly modern views on marital fidelity.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.560
But no matter.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.854
She is still fit for a queen.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.233
Would you mourn her passing, Leo?
I doubt it.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.696
Her death, Leo.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.908
Shelly's imminent demise.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.785
It's very simple, really.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.080
Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks,
Shelly dies.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.999
Maybe you'd like to help.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.126
Shelly. No.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.131
Good God, what have you got there?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.635
No, Leo, I'm begging you.

22:26.803 --> 22:30.181
- I prithee. Have mercy, Leo.
- Love Shelly.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.539
Poor Leo. Ha-ha-ha.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.293
We are all love's fools, more or less.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.796
But you will learn, as I have,

23:01.963 --> 23:04.882
the value of hate.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.260
Hi.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.537
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, Audrey.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.039
- Welcome home, honey.
- Thanks.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.249
Mwah.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.918
I got back this morning but
Agent Cooper needed to see me, so...

23:41.086 --> 23:42.128
Something's wrong?

23:42.295 --> 23:44.630
- Some creep sent me a poem.
- Oh.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.841
Um, I tried to call Jack's room,
but he wasn't there.

23:47.008 --> 23:51.345
- Do you know where he is?
- Audrey, while you were gone,

23:52.097 --> 23:55.975
- I had the most incredible brainstorm.
- What?

23:56.226 --> 24:00.896
The Stop Ghostwood movement
needs a spokesperson.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.483
Someone with a highly visible profile

24:04.651 --> 24:08.112
to be able to inspire
our community to action. Huh?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.906
Daddy, where's Jack?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.201
You can do it, Audrey.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.787
As Miss Twin Peaks,

24:16.955 --> 24:20.207
you could be that spokesperson and
you could use your public platform...

24:20.375 --> 24:24.170
- Heh. No, Dad.
...as a forum for environmental debate.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.505
Audrey, listen, you can do it.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.508
Only you can take our message
to the people.

24:29.718 --> 24:35.306
Daddy,
where is John Justice Wheeler?

24:37.934 --> 24:40.686
- He's gone.
- Where did he go?

24:43.648 --> 24:48.360
Some tragedy in Brazil
demanded his immediate attention.

24:49.404 --> 24:53.115
He left a letter for you.
I have it here.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.867
Daddy.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.623
- When did he leave?
- A few minutes ago, the airport.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.334
Audrey,
what about Miss Twin Peaks?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.711
I'll talk with you about this later,
okay? I promise.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.048
Audrey. Audrey. Audrey?

25:13.762 --> 25:16.138
Josie, I see your face.

25:16.306 --> 25:19.099
- Randy.
- Yes.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.102
Oh, forget it. You.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.687
Do you have a car?

25:23.855 --> 25:26.023
A truck. Runs like a dream.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.150
Great, let's go.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.612
Wait. Oh, I'm sorry.

25:31.780 --> 25:35.074
Come on. Come on.

25:37.744 --> 25:41.372
Well, the symbols suggest a time.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.666
Seems clear.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.169
- A time for what?
- I don't know.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.464
At first I thought it was a signpost.
Perhaps it's an invitation.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.132
Or both.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.509
Hmm.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.928
Where's the major?

25:56.471 --> 25:58.180
He should be here by now.

25:58.348 --> 26:02.685
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call,
see if the major's home yet.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.905
What is it, Coop?

26:16.366 --> 26:18.784
Oh, just thinking
about Annie Blackburn.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.330
Well, bless your heart.
I've never known your mind to wander.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.584
Oh, Harry,
I've been feeling this way all day.

26:27.168 --> 26:31.755
You know, I proceed as usual,
my mind clear and focused,

26:32.090 --> 26:38.220
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
I see her face and I hear her voice.

26:38.805 --> 26:42.600
Naturally, I try to reorient myself,
come back to the task at hand,

26:42.767 --> 26:46.020
but the image remains.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.355
Sometimes I actually feel dizzy.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.734
A man in love
is supposed to feel that way.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.945
Well, my symptoms suggest
the onset of malaria.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.573
But I've never felt better in my life.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.535
I'm sorry, Harry, that sounds foolish.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.706
No, no, man, it sounds lucky.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.781
Hmm.

27:44.913 --> 27:48.332
Home, home on the range

27:48.500 --> 27:52.336
Where the deer
And the antelope play

27:52.504 --> 27:57.424
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word

27:57.592 --> 27:59.885
Hello, Wilbur.

28:09.187 --> 28:13.148
And the skies are not cloudy all day

28:18.029 --> 28:21.240
Long time no see, Briggsy.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.038
Leo.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.582
It looks like
you've finally found your calling.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.775
Couldn't hurt to give it a shot.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.027
Maybe next year.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.573
Annie, there's a whole world out there.
Jump in.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.409
"Hear the other side.
See the other side."

29:05.577 --> 29:06.952
St. Augustine.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.455
- Coffee?
- You bet.

29:23.386 --> 29:27.014
- Something's troubling you.
- Yes.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.224
Would you like to talk about it?

29:31.644 --> 29:34.480
Annie, I'm involved
in a fairly complicated investigation

29:34.647 --> 29:36.648
requiring my complete attention.

29:36.816 --> 29:39.860
Yet I spend most of my time
thinking of you.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.321
I know the feeling.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.948
I've been seeing your face
in fried eggs all this morning.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.955
You know, there are those who believe
in a scientific basis for attraction.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.582
It's chemical.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.667
Is that what it is?

29:56.002 --> 29:57.711
I don't know.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.632
Hard to comprehend
without perspective.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.509
Yeah.

30:03.718 --> 30:06.970
I spent five years
trying to comprehend it, heh.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.431
Hey.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.059
It's hard for me.

30:12.268 --> 30:16.146
But I have faith in you,
in us, because I understand it.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.106
We're very much alike.

30:18.274 --> 30:19.733
It helps.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.194
We think too much.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.239
"What we observe
is not nature itself,

30:25.406 --> 30:29.076
but nature exposed
to our method of questioning."

30:30.411 --> 30:32.371
Heisenberg.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.710
Maybe we should go bowling.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.712
How about dancing?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.297
I don't know how.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.216
I'll teach you. It's easy.

30:44.384 --> 30:47.845
- When?
- Tonight.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.960
There he is. Step on it.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.887
Jack! Jack, stop!

31:38.479 --> 31:41.481
I guess a simple goodbye
was out of the question.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.411
I love you.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.955
I love you too.

31:59.292 --> 32:02.836
- Do you have to leave?
- Yes.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.713
When will you be back?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.466
I don't know.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.177
I'm a virgin.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.804
What?

32:14.057 --> 32:16.350
I want you to make love with me.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.394
What? Here and now?

32:20.438 --> 32:22.397
It's your jet.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.568
Thank God for that.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.520
When did you first see
the symbol in Owl Cave?

33:01.688 --> 33:04.690
I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

33:04.857 --> 33:05.983
Oh-ho-ho.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.402
Cheater. Ha, ha.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.910
What does the cave painting mean?

33:17.829 --> 33:22.040
I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

33:23.793 --> 33:27.004
Damn, but I love the military mind.

33:34.345 --> 33:38.390
What is the capital of North Carolina?

33:38.558 --> 33:40.559
Raleigh.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.355
Fat lot of good that will do me.

33:45.732 --> 33:50.027
Major, I admire your fortitude.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.571
Had I the time and patience,

33:52.739 --> 33:55.949
we might continue this game
indefinitely.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.660
However,

34:00.038 --> 34:02.039
I have neither.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.755
Catch.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.346
Your name, please?

34:18.514 --> 34:19.973
Garland Briggs.

34:20.183 --> 34:24.895
Garland, what do you fear most
in the world?

34:25.438 --> 34:29.316
The possibility
that love is not enough.

34:29.525 --> 34:33.070
Oh, Garland, please, I shall weep.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.989
How much does your wife weigh?

34:36.365 --> 34:38.366
One hundred and fifteen pounds.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.328
Oh, good for her.

34:41.496 --> 34:46.333
Now, when did you first see
the petroglyph in Owl Cave?

34:46.501 --> 34:49.503
In... In dreams.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.089
What kind of dreams?

34:53.174 --> 34:57.636
I was night fishing
with Agent Cooper.

34:58.346 --> 35:02.641
There was a light,
guardian beyond it.

35:03.017 --> 35:07.395
I was taken, but my mind...

35:07.980 --> 35:10.065
Still I recognized the signs.

35:10.858 --> 35:14.402
What do the signs mean?

35:14.695 --> 35:20.575
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet,

35:20.743 --> 35:23.120
they will receive you.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.256
Garland, Garland.

35:34.465 --> 35:40.303
Garland, Garland, I was hoping
for a lengthy conversation.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.640
Leo, put the major to bed.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.018
I'm afraid his mind
has begun to wander.

35:47.687 --> 35:53.775
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.783
His woman servant, Jones,

36:01.951 --> 36:04.619
delivered this to me
shortly after he died.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.496
Eckhardt's last bequest.

36:06.664 --> 36:10.709
A clever jape, perhaps,
or something of value.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.669
Try this.

36:12.962 --> 36:19.009
No, you see, there's a secret
to opening each of these boxes.

36:20.595 --> 36:24.222
And this one
is about to drive me mad.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.224
Oh, Andrew,
tell me something good.

36:27.018 --> 36:32.147
Our foreign investors are chomping
at the bit from Paris to Beijing.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.815
You're going to get your golf course.

36:33.983 --> 36:36.318
Right next to
The Great Northern Hotel.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.529
And Benjamin is doing everything
he can to stop us.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.782
Well, it's too late. When the project
was still in his possession,

36:42.950 --> 36:44.701
Ben cleared every possible hurdle:

36:44.911 --> 36:48.121
the zoning, the impact statements.

36:48.289 --> 36:53.585
He was and is
his own worst enemy.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.503
As always. What are you doing?

36:55.671 --> 36:59.883
Nothing, Catherine, I'm just
trying a few simple combinations.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.302
- Let me, let me.
- No, Catherine.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.723
Eckhardt's birthday.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.647
My birthday.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.903
The day the gift arrived.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.494
- Ah! Ha, ha. Ah.
- Give it to me.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.584
- Oh, what a bore.
- I opened it.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.925
Oh.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.095
Andrew...

37:47.139 --> 37:48.265
Huh.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.910
I'm not completely prepared for this.

38:51.078 --> 38:54.622
Just think of it as a walking embrace,
all right?

38:54.790 --> 38:59.127
Two people stepping
as one would step.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.840
- So far, so good.
- Now, just follow me.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.468
- We'll follow each other.
- Mm-hm.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.889
- Good.
Mm-hm.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.849
It's genetic memory.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.477
Mom and Dad danced the lindy.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.358
You've got it.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.408
Your body feels nice against mine.

39:31.827 --> 39:34.371
I was just thinking the same thing.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.123
Listen, if I'm being too forward...

39:39.168 --> 39:42.170
- I want more than your kisses.
- For instance?

39:42.338 --> 39:43.922
- I want...
- This thing on?

39:46.008 --> 39:51.304
Welcome to this final night
of festivities

39:51.472 --> 39:56.726
celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks...

39:58.354 --> 40:04.692
As some of you...
Damnation, is this damn thing on?

40:05.361 --> 40:10.240
What I mean is
I understand why you hesitate,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.784
why you treat me with care.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.912
The convent evokes the image
of helpless women,

40:16.080 --> 40:17.705
fearful of the thought of any emotion

40:17.873 --> 40:22.252
other than those derived
from scripture and prayer.

40:22.628 --> 40:26.297
But when you hold me,

40:26.590 --> 40:28.591
when we kiss,

40:28.926 --> 40:32.887
I feel safe and eager.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.890
I'm not afraid

40:36.058 --> 40:41.020
of anything
that you make me feel or want.

40:46.819 --> 40:50.738
Is this on? Huh? Is this on?

40:50.948 --> 40:52.866
I'm beginning to tire
of his interruptions.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.285
- Welcome to...
- I don't know. I think he's cute.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.746
...this final night of festivities...
- You do?

40:58.914 --> 41:01.082
I think that maybe I will enter after all.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.961
- The Miss Twin Peaks contest?
- Why not?

41:05.129 --> 41:08.298
"Hear the other side.
See the other side."

41:08.466 --> 41:11.426
There's worse places to start
than Miss Twin Peaks.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.553
It's like a fairy tale.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.722
And you're the queen.

41:29.361 --> 41:32.405
No.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.588
Huh?

42:19.036 --> 42:20.328
What a gyp.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.038
Finally meet the man of my dreams,

42:22.206 --> 42:24.290
next thing I know,
he's on a plane to Brazil.

42:27.044 --> 42:28.878
He'll be back one day.

42:29.088 --> 42:32.590
- He promised.
- Yeah.

42:33.509 --> 42:37.262
Well, he also promised
to take me fishing, and we never did.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.306
Love stinks.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.101
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.770
Pearl Lake or something.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.691
I have some tackle in the truck.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.318
You do?

42:54.363 --> 42:59.534
Audrey, there are many cures
for a broken heart,

43:00.619 --> 43:05.290
but nothing quite like
a trout's leap in the moonlight.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.378
May I?

43:14.466 --> 43:16.342
You may.

43:27.521 --> 43:30.398
Jupiter and Saturn meet

43:30.566 --> 43:34.068
Oh, what a crop of mummy wheat

43:36.447 --> 43:40.325
The planets our babbling major
spoke of are more than distant orbs.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.535
They are, in fact, a clock.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.537
A clock that tells the time.

43:44.747 --> 43:45.788
And the time...

43:47.207 --> 43:49.792
Time draws nearer
with each ticking tock.

43:50.002 --> 43:53.046
Dale wasn't far wrong. The cave
painting is an invitation of sorts,

43:53.213 --> 43:55.131
telling us when the revels begin.

43:55.299 --> 43:59.093
But what Dale doesn't know
is where to find it.

43:59.303 --> 44:03.306
For, you see, the cave painting
is not only an invitation,

44:03.474 --> 44:05.558
it is also a map.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.852
A map to the Black Lodge!

44:24.495 --> 44:26.371
There's something wrong.

44:27.289 --> 44:30.124
This isn't right.
There's something wrong here.
