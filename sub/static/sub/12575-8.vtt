Hey, my dad's invitation to the party
got returned.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.941
<i>"Grandpa Cotton Hill, Hell, USA?"</i>

00:20.220 --> 00:24.316
<i>Bobby, why did you write this?
You know your grandpa lives in Houston.</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:26.120
Mom says he's the devil.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.626
Peggy, how can you tell Bobby that?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.287
I said "evil," Hank.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.558
How you get "devil"
from that is beyond me.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.532
I don't want Grandpa at my party.

00:34.601 --> 00:38.332
The kids are already gonna hate me
because you got the wrong bean dip.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.066
What's wrong with the bean dip?

00:40.140 --> 00:42.335
Wait. What's wrong with your grandpa?

00:42.409 --> 00:45.901
He's got big plastic teeth,
he screams all the time...

00:46.046 --> 00:47.570
his legs don't work.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.616
Bobby, never make fun
of your grandpa's legs.

00:51.151 --> 00:55.451
He lost his shins defending Texas
in World War II.

00:55.855 --> 01:00.451
Now, son, pick up that phone and invite
your granddad to your birthday party.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.558
Bobby, if you're gonna fake dial...

you gotta hit more than three numbers.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.183
Huh? Huh?

01:59.785 --> 02:01.548
This party's boring.

02:01.987 --> 02:03.750
Everybody hates you.

02:03.989 --> 02:06.321
Why you so pissed off for, Peggy Hill?

02:06.392 --> 02:09.589
Oh, nothing. Just Hank's father.
He's driving in for the party.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.562
Oh, Lord, that crazy Cotton Hill.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.894
I heard, after Hank's mother left Cotton...

02:13.966 --> 02:15.866
he married his 16-year-old nurse.

02:15.935 --> 02:18.403
Dee Dee is 39, thank you very much.

Did you try burping the alphabet?

02:39.892 --> 02:41.757
BOBBY: That's my closer, Dad.

Did you win World War II?

02:58.210 --> 03:01.373
- This rib eye is for my daddy.
- Cotton's coming?

03:03.048 --> 03:06.142
If I was you, Kahn,
I'd amscray before he gets here.

03:06.218 --> 03:09.619
Yeah, if he finds out you're from Japan,
you know...

03:29.842 --> 03:31.969
You really outdid yourself this time.

03:32.044 --> 03:34.740
Well, you know me. I'm larger than life.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.380
What are you looking at, Moe?

03:42.454 --> 03:46.015
A Japanese machine gun
blew my shins off in WW II.

03:46.425 --> 03:47.687

03:47.760 --> 03:50.661
- You like that horse, Bobby?
- I love it, Grandpa.

03:50.729 --> 03:54.165
Well, you can love it for four more hours.
It's a rental.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.167

Hey, Hank's wife.

04:01.473 --> 04:04.374
How long have you been here, Cotton?
I didn't notice you...

04:04.443 --> 04:07.071
Dee Dee, come on out here,
and gab with Hank's wife.

do you still like...

Dad, this here's my new neighbor.

04:42.748 --> 04:44.272
He's Japanese.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.817
No, he ain't!

04:47.486 --> 04:50.614
He's Laotian. Ain't you, Mr. Kahn?

04:53.425 --> 04:56.189
All right. Time to open my gift.

<i>A Super Squirter!</i>

It ain't no water toy, Mr. Kahn!

05:05.337 --> 05:08.568
It's a genuine Winchester
20-gauge shotgun!

05:08.674 --> 05:10.665
You got a real gun.

05:10.743 --> 05:13.007
No, and now Peggy Hill has a real gun.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.376
Bobby, you are too young
to own a firearm.

05:15.447 --> 05:19.247
Did you see that, Hank?
Tell your woman to give him back his gun!

05:19.318 --> 05:20.615
PEGGY: His woman?

05:20.686 --> 05:24.213
Oh, Cotton, I am my own woman.
And don't you forget it.

05:24.289 --> 05:27.554
Peg, that's just cowboy talk. Come on.

Hey, let's go bust open that pinata!

COTTON: That's it!
PEGGY: Come on, Bobby.

05:35.167 --> 05:39.331
Hank, the boy can barely reach it.
Lower the pinata so he has a chance at it.

It must be made of kryptonite
or something.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.922
For crying out loud!

06:02.027 --> 06:05.258
Good Lord, Cotton.
You gave him a loaded shotgun?

06:05.330 --> 06:08.265
You don't give a toy without batteries.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.999
Come and get your Tootsie Rolls!

06:11.270 --> 06:15.001
Oh, I am so sorry your grandpa
ruined your birthday, son.

Permission granted!

06:36.829 --> 06:39.457
Put an apron over your new bosom, too.

Don't tell her, but I got them cheap.

with your life?</i>

06:45.704 --> 06:47.638
I'm gonna be a prop comic.

I'm working on this bit
where I stick a green bean up my nose.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.408
Well, now that sounds promising.

06:53.479 --> 06:57.882
Hank, Bobby and me have decided
he's gonna stick vegetables up his nose.

06:58.016 --> 07:00.416
He's not gonna take over
the family gas station.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.046
Dad, I don't work at a gas station.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.522
I sell propane and propane accessories.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.990
Don't sass me, boy.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.584
You ain't too big
for me to give you a licking.

You're breaking my good dishes.

I will fix you a to-go plate.

No. Just pop the hood.
Hank can fix it in a minute.

07:38.891 --> 07:42.622
Don't bother, Uncle Hank.
I can't hear the solenoid plunger.

07:42.694 --> 07:44.252
You're gonna need a new one.

07:44.329 --> 07:48.163
Thanks a lot, girlie.
But the truth is, you're a girl.

07:48.233 --> 07:51.669
We'll have to wait till your gas station
opens up in the morning.

07:51.737 --> 07:52.829
I'm staying over.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.339
I wish you could.
But we are all out of beds.

07:55.407 --> 07:57.136
I don't need a bed.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.973
I can sleep in a drawer,
after what they did to me overseas.

08:01.513 --> 08:03.378
I can sleep on the couch, Mom.

08:03.448 --> 08:06.747
- That'll be just fine. L...
- Excuse me for just a second.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.616

foul-mouthed old man to spend
another moment in my house.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.785
You just don't understand him.

08:13.859 --> 08:17.522
<i>See, he's a big, flamboyant character,
like a peacock.</i>

08:17.696 --> 08:19.254
That's why men love him.

08:19.331 --> 08:23.495
But women don't like his style,
because you all are like the peahen.

08:23.702 --> 08:25.761
<i>More subdued and drab.</i>

08:26.839 --> 08:29.967
You just cannot see your father
for who he is.

08:30.242 --> 08:32.710
Well, Bobby and I both want him to stay.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.336
That means you're outvoted.

08:34.413 --> 08:38.017
Oh, yeah? Well, Luanne hates him, too.
That means we're even.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.583
<i>Well, Jesus loves him. So I win.</i>

08:40.652 --> 08:42.517
What does that have to do with...

08:42.587 --> 08:44.613
Dad, we'd love it if you stayed.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.021
Well, all righty!

I drive you to school today, Bobby?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.863
Hank, you fixed my car yet?

09:01.940 --> 09:03.271
I just woke up.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.503
Just... It's 7:00 a.m.

If you were in the army,
you could've dug 10 graves by now!

Good-Iooking breakfast, Peg.

09:12.751 --> 09:15.720
Yeah, I see bacon, I see ham.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.521
I see steak.

There's no sausage!</i>

09:21.393 --> 09:22.451

<i>You are welcome to march yourself
down to the Safeway.</i>

09:25.864 --> 09:28.264
But I have to get ready for work.

09:28.534 --> 09:32.026
<i>See, Bobby?
Woman works, man loses his sausage.</i>

09:32.704 --> 09:34.899
Cotton, I'd love to debate this with you...

09:34.973 --> 09:37.441
but I am just a little too busy living here...

09:37.509 --> 09:39.602
in the latter half of the 20th century.

09:39.678 --> 09:43.170
Dad, if you want to drive Bobby to school,
use my truck.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.873
I'll go rig up your pedal extenders.

09:46.585 --> 09:48.985
You're all skin and bones, girlie.

09:49.254 --> 09:51.779
Put some cornpone on them hips.

09:51.957 --> 09:53.686
I don't want any, Grandpa Hill.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.853
- Don't want to get fat.
- That's not for you to worry about.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.329
You will never know if you are attractive.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.389
<i>It's up to a man to tell you that.</i>

10:01.467 --> 10:04.493
You keep eating,
and I'll tell you when to stop.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.664

that corn pone, old man.

You're sure it's okay for me
to be out of school today, Grandpa?

10:17.216 --> 10:19.411
Oh, yeah. It's a holiday, isn't it?

10:19.485 --> 10:21.783
It's Angie Dickinson's birthday.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.254
Now, why don't you order us some food?

10:24.323 --> 10:26.985
Really? Dad never lets me order.

10:27.092 --> 10:29.219
Well, you ain't with your daddy today.

10:29.294 --> 10:30.556
Go to it.

[Clears throat]

Ma'am?

10:36.502 --> 10:38.129
Oh, good, sweet...

10:38.270 --> 10:40.397
You'll never get no service that way.

10:40.472 --> 10:42.997
You gotta get her in the moneymaker.

10:43.775 --> 10:45.208
Hey, Missy!

10:45.277 --> 10:47.302
How about some samiches?

10:48.013 --> 10:49.275
[Laughing]

10:52.284 --> 10:53.945
HANK: That's the dangdest thing.

10:54.019 --> 10:57.386
I never heard of a solenoid
just disappearing before.

10:57.623 --> 10:58.681
I don't know.

10:58.757 --> 11:02.193
<i>Sometimes, things just disappear
for no logical reason.</i>

11:02.528 --> 11:05.895
One day, my cousin woke up,
his kidney was gone.

11:06.198 --> 11:10.134
At the same time, 500 miles away...

11:10.469 --> 11:13.404
a woman in Phoenix contracted diabetes.

- What is to understand?

12:29.815 --> 12:32.340
Your father disfigured
his own automobile...

You're right. It's my fault.

Your father.

I can't change my father.

15:03.468 --> 15:05.936

For example...
