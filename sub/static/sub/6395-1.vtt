00:35.618 --> 00:38.348
I'm late. I'm late.

00:46.229 --> 00:48.094
Ready for your speech, Ms. Ryan?

00:52.268 --> 00:54.668
Are you sure you're prepared this time?

00:57.006 --> 00:59.600
Are you sure you're not
forgetting anything, Jane?

01:04.781 --> 01:06.942
Sure you're not
forgetting anything, Jane?

01:07.250 --> 01:09.445
Please welcome Jane Ryan.

01:14.891 --> 01:16.518
What?

01:51.427 --> 01:52.655
Just a dream.

02:08.912 --> 02:11.813
Morning, Mom. Miss you.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.181
- Morning.
- Morning, Dad.

02:23.526 --> 02:25.118
I'm up.

02:25.295 --> 02:26.887
I'm up.

02:56.392 --> 02:58.724
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Jane Ryan.

02:58.895 --> 03:00.453
My name is Jane Ryan.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.063
My name is Jane Ryan.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.091
Good morning, Justin.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.532
"Simple Plan shoot...

03:07.704 --> 03:10.229
...59th and Ninth, New York City."

03:12.075 --> 03:15.044
- Making sure you're up.
- Yeah, just finishing an essay.

03:15.211 --> 03:18.647
Three weeks into school,
and you haven't cut once. I like it.

03:18.815 --> 03:22.307
Maybe I won't have to send you
to Sister Mary Margaret's after all.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.818
School...

03:24.988 --> 03:27.252
...or Simple Plan video shoot?

03:27.423 --> 03:30.290
I'm here today as a finalist
for the McGill Fellowship.

03:50.413 --> 03:53.348
What excuses shall we
use this time, Ringo?

03:53.583 --> 03:57.986
Ringo? Ringo, where are you?

03:58.154 --> 04:00.622
"Death of a pet, religious holiday...

04:00.790 --> 04:04.817
...female problems." Last week.

04:06.262 --> 04:10.528
"Lllnesses. Chickenpox." Print.

04:14.904 --> 04:16.928
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.038
Thank you, New York City!

05:01.451 --> 05:03.885
Ringo, there you are.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.352
Did the little mean lady scare you?

05:07.523 --> 05:10.651
Yes, I know she did.

05:38.855 --> 05:43.815
Jane. Why do you insist on playing Mom?
Okay? Dad doesn't have time for breakfast.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.927
Not listening.

05:49.665 --> 05:52.031
- How's it going, guys?
- Hi.

05:52.201 --> 05:54.635
- Your breakfast is on the table.
- Smells great.

05:54.804 --> 05:56.704
Wait.

05:56.873 --> 05:58.101
- There you go.
- Thanks.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.037
You're welcome.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.307
Never, ever touch my day planner.

06:07.483 --> 06:11.647
Okay, you need to chill on the nerd book,
okay? You have issues.

06:12.088 --> 06:14.784
Okay, how frequent are the contractions?

06:15.525 --> 06:19.461
Have them head down to the hospital.
I'll meet them there. Yeah.

06:21.230 --> 06:23.095
- Jane...
- No, Dad, it's fine.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.394
No, it's not fine.
I know this is your big day.

06:26.936 --> 06:30.463
I will do everything I can to get
to Columbia to see your speech.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.741
- I know you will.
- Okay, excuse me.

06:32.909 --> 06:36.777
Jane, sorry, I know this is the biggest day
of your academic career...

06:36.946 --> 06:40.643
...but Dad, will you sign my field-trip
permission form, please?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.342
Shakespeare in the Park?
Great! Which play?

06:46.355 --> 06:49.449
You know, the one with
the girl and the guy...

06:49.959 --> 06:54.259
...love, the tights, hair.
- Romeo and Juliet?

06:54.697 --> 06:58.326
- Yeah! Thank you. I totally blanked.
- I love that play.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.493
- I know. Me too.
- Your mom would have been so proud.

07:05.408 --> 07:07.638
Would you mind giving your sister a lift?

07:07.810 --> 07:11.678
- Not at all.
- It wouldn't kill you to spend time together.

07:13.049 --> 07:15.017
Breakfast was great, but I got to go.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.175
Okay. Well, then, take this, okay?

07:17.353 --> 07:19.480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:19.655 --> 07:23.455
- Love you.
- Love you too. Good luck.

07:27.563 --> 07:31.863
- I hope you don't get caught.
- I won't.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.663
- Let's get the show on the road.
- Think about a car wash.

07:35.838 --> 07:37.965
You might wanna think
about buying a car.

07:38.141 --> 07:41.440
- I'm saving up for college.
- That makes one of us.

07:41.944 --> 07:44.412
Mind putting on the radio?

07:45.181 --> 07:48.207
- Not at all.
- What is this?

07:50.419 --> 07:53.047
Too cool for school.

07:55.291 --> 07:56.724
Yeah.

08:28.791 --> 08:32.022
Where are we going? We have
26 minutes to get to the station...

08:32.195 --> 08:33.662
...and I can't be late.

08:33.828 --> 08:38.732
We just have to make a pit stop
at my manager's.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.960
Wait, you have a manager?

08:41.470 --> 08:42.903
- Howdy, Rox.
- Hello.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.767
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

08:54.483 --> 08:55.882
Seventy-eight!

08:56.052 --> 08:58.885
- So how's the party?
- It's going great.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.920
We're on a marathon mission.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.456
So I burned you 30. Check it out.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.253
Thanks.

09:05.761 --> 09:07.888
- Why am I on the cover?
- Marketing, baby.

09:08.064 --> 09:11.158
- You're the hottest one in the band.
- Hey, Roxy.

09:11.334 --> 09:14.531
- That's not saying much.
- Here's your all-access pass.

09:14.704 --> 09:17.332
That will get you into the shoot.
Now, remember...

09:17.506 --> 09:19.804
...we've got to hit up the A-and-R guys.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.104
- We gotta get this contract.
- How will I know it's them?

09:23.279 --> 09:26.146
Middle-aged guys, fancy suits...

09:26.315 --> 09:28.340
...bad, old-fashioned dancing.
- Right.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.178
- Got it? All right.
- Yes. Bye.

09:30.353 --> 09:32.947
- Good luck.
- Okay. Thank you.

09:36.692 --> 09:38.159
Yeah, 79!

09:39.629 --> 09:40.857
Who's there?

09:41.030 --> 09:43.191
- Pool guy.
- Pool guy?

09:43.366 --> 09:44.958
You're not the pool guy.

09:45.134 --> 09:47.466
You get to go right to the head
of the class.

09:47.637 --> 09:51.596
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
Pool party's over, Flubber.

09:51.774 --> 09:55.107
Do you want to come over here?
Put your hands behind your head.

09:55.278 --> 09:58.145
On your feet, gentlemen.
Hands up where I can see them.

09:58.314 --> 10:00.680
- Up, up, up!
- What's going on?

10:00.850 --> 10:04.047
You let me do the interrogating, son,
we'll get along fine.

10:06.289 --> 10:08.655
My mom's gonna kill me.

10:08.824 --> 10:13.022
Got six future felons for you, Strauss.
Each one facing five to 10...

10:13.195 --> 10:15.186
Days of detention, Lomax.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.457
- Days of detention.
- Just book them.

10:17.633 --> 10:20.431
"Book them." Would you
give it a rest, Lomax?

10:20.603 --> 10:23.367
You're a truancy officer,
you're not Dirty Harry.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.498
You know, this kind of crud is what
kept you out of the force for 25 years.

10:27.677 --> 10:30.874
I'm on the heels of the number-one truant
in Nassau County...

10:31.047 --> 10:33.515
...and when I find her, and I will find her...

10:33.683 --> 10:37.676
...your boys will be doing back flips
to make sure I'm wearing that badge.

10:37.853 --> 10:39.616
Hey, Einstein, over here.

10:39.789 --> 10:42.986
I feel bad lumping you in there
with those other losers...

10:43.159 --> 10:47.755
...because you strike me as being a...
I don't know, a smart kid.

10:47.930 --> 10:50.091
I see a big future here.

10:50.433 --> 10:54.199
I look at this face,
I see a surgeon general.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.432
I see a Supreme Court judge.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.936
Do you have any idea what a 10-day
suspension will look like on your record?

11:02.111 --> 11:05.512
You'll be lucky to be accepted
to the Acme School of Welding.

11:05.681 --> 11:07.012
Now...

11:07.183 --> 11:09.344
...do yourself a favor.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.784
Where can I find Roxanne Ryan?

11:11.954 --> 11:14.320
You can give me
all the detention you like.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.288
But if there's something I'm not,
that's a rat.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.020
Fine. Suit yourself.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.862
- Car, car! Look out!
- Hold on.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.200
What's the matter with you?!

11:32.308 --> 11:34.970
- Nice park.
- Thanks.

11:55.498 --> 11:58.626
Excuse me, could you just not?

12:00.703 --> 12:03.672
Okay, speech at 3.

12:04.407 --> 12:07.001
Perfect. Okay...

12:22.525 --> 12:24.322
You can't sit here. I need quiet.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.155
Chill. You won't even know I'm here.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.095
I'm close to winning the fellowship.
I've worked my whole life for this.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.167
What is this stupid thing, anyway?

12:33.335 --> 12:36.964
This stupid thing is a four-year
scholarship to Oxford University.

12:37.139 --> 12:38.766
Oxford?

12:38.941 --> 12:41.967
- As in England?
- No, Oxford, as in nowhere near you.

12:42.144 --> 12:45.272
- Maybe you would like to switch seats...
- No!

12:45.448 --> 12:46.676
Yeah.

12:47.483 --> 12:50.043
- Why Oxford?
- Why are you even here?

12:51.153 --> 12:54.020
Because Simple Plan's shooting
their new music video.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.356
So I'll canvass the A-and-R guys,
give them my demo...

12:57.526 --> 12:59.653
...and hopefully be the new opening act.

12:59.829 --> 13:03.026
Great. There'll be lots of concerts
at Sister Mary Margaret's.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.757
How's the school gonna know?

13:04.934 --> 13:07.869
As far as they're concerned,
I'm home with the chicken...

13:08.037 --> 13:09.664
Chickenpox.

13:15.578 --> 13:17.705
Chickenpox, my Aunt Fanny.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.208
Who is it?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.647
It's Savitsky, your landlord.
You're two weeks late on rent.

13:23.819 --> 13:26.982
Mr. Savitsky,
can we deal with this later...

13:27.156 --> 13:30.819
...because I'm working on a very big
case right now. I'm busy.

13:30.993 --> 13:33.894
- You're dizzy? You should lie down.
- I said, I'm busy!

13:34.063 --> 13:36.588
So get busy writing a check,
Lomax! Jeez.

13:42.771 --> 13:46.172
Where have you gone, Miss Ryan?

13:46.675 --> 13:48.370
Where have you gone?

13:51.113 --> 13:56.574
Well, your simple plan's about to get a bit
more complicated, Roxanne Ryan.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.587
All right, open up.

14:09.231 --> 14:11.324
Can you believe this?

14:11.500 --> 14:14.094
- I'm sorry.
- All right, Roxy Ryan!

14:14.270 --> 14:16.295
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay!

14:16.872 --> 14:19.864
- I'm so sorry!
- What are you...? Stop that!

14:20.042 --> 14:23.478
- I'm sorry.
- What are you, a couple of monsters?

14:23.779 --> 14:27.977
Tickets. Tickets, please.
Please have your tickets ready.

14:28.317 --> 14:31.616
Tickets, please. I'm not doing
this for my health. Thank you.

14:31.787 --> 14:36.747
- I suppose you'll need some money?
- No. I can manage on my own.

14:39.328 --> 14:42.422
- Hello?
- Tickets. Very nice.

14:42.598 --> 14:44.759
Tickets, please.

14:45.601 --> 14:47.660
- Oh, my...
- I'm in hell.

14:47.836 --> 14:50.634
- I'm sorry.
- What are you looking at? Stop looking!

14:58.480 --> 15:00.641
I said I was...

15:00.916 --> 15:02.941
Ticket.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.585
Hi.

15:06.188 --> 15:11.251
We are so over! Over!

15:13.629 --> 15:15.119
Shoot.

15:15.531 --> 15:16.759
Oh, very funny.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.331
- Excuse me?
- No ticket, no ride.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.732
- I have a ticket. Give me a minute.
- Let's see it. Come on.

15:22.905 --> 15:26.272
That was my twin sister you just threw off.
Right there.

15:26.442 --> 15:29.434
Oh, yeah. The phantom twin sister.
I'm scared. Hold me.

15:29.612 --> 15:31.671
Do I look that stupid to you?

15:33.082 --> 15:34.674
Do you want me to answer that?

15:34.850 --> 15:37.717
- I have a ticket! It's in my purse!
- Let's go. Come on.

15:37.886 --> 15:39.979
Step away from the train.

15:41.123 --> 15:42.818
- God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

15:42.992 --> 15:44.220
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

15:44.393 --> 15:47.521
Here, just give me a sec, okay? One sec.

15:47.696 --> 15:52.030
Okay. If you can't get it out,
I'll just take my skirt off.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.460
Did I just say that out loud?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.633
Yeah, you did.

15:58.641 --> 16:01.132
- Man, you're really stuck, you know that?
- Yeah.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.370
All right, on the count of three.
One, two, three.

16:05.314 --> 16:07.339
Oh, my God!

16:07.516 --> 16:09.313
Oh, my God.

16:11.186 --> 16:13.416
Hey, it looks nice.

16:13.589 --> 16:15.386
Thanks.

16:20.596 --> 16:24.862
All aboard! If you have a ticket.

16:25.434 --> 16:27.299
I gotta go.

16:27.469 --> 16:30.632
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.701
Hopefully.

16:33.876 --> 16:36.868
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:43.552 --> 16:47.454
The ripped look? It's so two minutes ago.

16:47.790 --> 16:51.624
Stay away from me.

16:53.362 --> 16:57.799
According to this schedule, it says there
should be another train in 43 minutes.

16:57.966 --> 17:00.730
Not today there isn't. Track construction.

17:00.903 --> 17:04.896
- Next train for New York leaves in 3 hours.
- You've got to be kidding me.

17:05.074 --> 17:06.665
- Taxi!
- Hey!

17:06.842 --> 17:08.742
Taxi!

17:08.911 --> 17:10.878
Nice move.

17:58.393 --> 18:00.520
There you are.

18:01.196 --> 18:03.187
Here I am.

18:03.365 --> 18:05.731
All of the taxis are gone.

18:05.901 --> 18:08.529
And you need a ride.

18:08.704 --> 18:09.932
I give you ride.

18:10.706 --> 18:13.004
- No.
- I give you free ride.

18:14.042 --> 18:16.977
No. I don't take rides from strangers.

18:17.146 --> 18:20.309
But I got a limo. Big, long, white one
like Barbie ride in.

18:22.584 --> 18:26.748
I don't believe you. It says it right here.
There's gonna be another train.

18:27.589 --> 18:30.717
How could I forget?
It's the magic-leprechaun train.

18:30.893 --> 18:34.989
It leaves for New York whenever you want.
Powered by your imagination.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.358
- Jane!
- I'm sorry, is someone talking?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.161
Because I don't hear anyone.

18:40.335 --> 18:44.169
I just wanna let you know I have a limo
if you're looking for a ride.

18:44.339 --> 18:46.967
Don't worry,
it's a professional car service.

18:48.010 --> 18:51.104
Your attention please, the 9:45 to...

18:51.346 --> 18:53.211
- Thanks.
- Here, let me get your bag.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.112
- No, it's okay. I got it.
- But I insist.

18:56.285 --> 18:58.014
No, it's okay. I insist.

18:58.187 --> 19:00.178
Wait for me.

19:00.355 --> 19:04.485
My personal assistant.
I'd be lost without her.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.925
My name's Bennie.
You and her going same place?

19:08.096 --> 19:12.556
"You and she." The correct grammar is "she."
See, you're using the wrong possessive...

19:13.602 --> 19:14.762
Smarty pants.

19:14.937 --> 19:18.532
You've reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message after the beep.

19:19.107 --> 19:21.507
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...

19:21.677 --> 19:23.736
...Nassau County Department of Truancy.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.745
I'm calling in regard to
your daughter Roxanne.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.316
Could you call me at 993-1176...

19:30.485 --> 19:35.752
...and reference case number
7 Tango Niner Popcorn X-ray 5?

19:35.924 --> 19:38.586
Have a pleasant day.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.641
How's it going?

19:59.181 --> 20:01.342
How you doing?

20:05.854 --> 20:07.253
Stop it.

20:07.422 --> 20:10.323
- Roxy, please. I can't concentrate.
- What's up?

20:15.530 --> 20:16.690
Please stop.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.168
Get me Ma.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.633
It's number-one adopted son.

20:30.012 --> 20:33.709
Bennie? You said you be here by 9 a.m.

20:33.882 --> 20:37.113
That was 20 minutes ago.
I need that chip.

20:37.286 --> 20:39.379
Bennie will be there soon, Ma.

20:39.554 --> 20:43.217
Bennie, either you talk in Chinese
or you speak in English.

20:43.392 --> 20:45.019
But enough with the accent.

20:45.193 --> 20:48.253
- I'm sorry, Ma.
- Don't call me Ma.

20:48.430 --> 20:51.831
From 9 to 5, you're my number-one
killing machine.

20:53.535 --> 20:56.470
Yes, I'm your killing machine, Ma.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.137
Bye, Ma.

21:06.448 --> 21:08.348
Kids.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.591
Hey, bud? Are you lost?

21:57.299 --> 21:59.324
Ancient Chinese proverb:

22:00.268 --> 22:03.169
Never accept ride from stranger!

22:05.173 --> 22:08.074
- Help! Help us!
- Help!

22:08.877 --> 22:13.007
- Help! He's gonna kill us!
- Help!

22:15.250 --> 22:17.616
Come on! Hurry!

22:18.153 --> 22:20.087
Okay, let's go! Come on.

22:22.758 --> 22:23.918
Thank you.

22:40.642 --> 22:42.974
- Why is he after us?
- Go!

22:47.382 --> 22:49.873
- I think we lost him.
- There you are.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.834
- You speak Chinese?
- There's a lot you don't know about me.

23:07.836 --> 23:10.805
- Give me that!
- Hey, buster!

23:17.012 --> 23:19.139
Bring it on, tubby.

23:19.581 --> 23:22.015
I didn't know you took jujitsu.

23:22.184 --> 23:24.812
- Tae kwon do.
- Thanks.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.248
Two times a week.

23:26.521 --> 23:28.113
Three years.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.022
- Now I'm mad.
- What are you...?

23:36.298 --> 23:38.493
- That hurt.
- Here we go.

23:42.270 --> 23:43.498
Yeah!

23:48.977 --> 23:51.138
I'm gonna kill you!

23:53.715 --> 23:56.309
That's what we get for
taking a ride from a stranger.

23:56.485 --> 23:59.511
- Please. It was exciting.
- Exciting?

23:59.688 --> 24:03.954
Almost being mugged and getting stuck
in the middle of nowhere is not exciting.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.888
Now what?

24:07.729 --> 24:09.253
These were my best heels.

24:09.431 --> 24:10.898
Give me the other one.

24:11.133 --> 24:13.727
Give me the shoe. Please. Thank you.

24:19.808 --> 24:21.469
Now they're your best flats.

24:23.612 --> 24:25.705
Either of you ladies spare some change?

24:25.881 --> 24:28.907
- Oh, yeah, here.
- You're feeding this poor man's disease.

24:29.084 --> 24:32.713
- Just let him have the dollar.
- Buy him a snack, like a granola bar.

24:36.024 --> 24:37.753
Thanks. I got a dollar!

24:37.926 --> 24:40.986
That is not just a cherry Slurpee.

24:41.363 --> 24:43.854
I smell alcohol. Please don't freak.

24:47.836 --> 24:49.269
Or not.

25:03.618 --> 25:05.085
Yes!

25:07.255 --> 25:11.214
Now we're cooking with gas.
Out of the way, suckers.

25:12.727 --> 25:16.060
Come on, folks. Police emergency.

25:16.231 --> 25:17.459
Come on!

25:17.632 --> 25:22.626
Back up, people. Clear the street.
You call this respect for the law?

25:23.171 --> 25:25.435
I look like a duck waddling
in these shoes.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.644
DVD.

25:31.046 --> 25:34.277
Very cheap. Need Holiday.

25:36.051 --> 25:37.951
Wait!

25:42.691 --> 25:44.955
Great. Just great.

25:46.528 --> 25:49.793
- Can I use your restroom?
- Bathroom is for customer only.

25:56.104 --> 25:57.935
Down the aisle to the left.

25:59.174 --> 26:02.507
She has her whole life ahead of her.
She should not be drinking.

26:02.677 --> 26:04.304
That's what I keep telling her.

26:35.010 --> 26:39.344
You've reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message...

26:39.514 --> 26:41.641
You have one new message.

26:41.816 --> 26:43.841
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...

26:44.119 --> 26:48.783
...Nassau County Department of Truancy.
- Correction, this was Max Lomax.

26:57.966 --> 27:01.527
- These for now, those for later.
- Very hungry for a small person.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.864
- Thirsty too? Okay.
- Red Bull.

27:14.149 --> 27:16.310
- You'll never pull it off.
- Never?

27:16.484 --> 27:19.248
- Not today. Not tomorrow.
- So no.

27:26.461 --> 27:28.088
I like the yellow one better.

27:28.263 --> 27:29.594
Really?

27:34.069 --> 27:36.060
What did you do, fall in?

27:36.237 --> 27:37.534
Cash or charge?

27:39.808 --> 27:41.935
I need some money.

27:42.477 --> 27:45.071
Total amount is 47.24.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.142
Oh, my God! My day planner!

27:48.316 --> 27:53.948
I must have left it in the limo! My life is in
it! My speech, my credit cards, my money!

27:55.323 --> 27:58.224
So I don't suppose I could start a tab?

27:58.393 --> 28:00.293
Tab is for valid customers only.

28:00.462 --> 28:02.225
Thank you. Don't come again.

28:03.898 --> 28:05.627
This is all your fault.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.132
How's it my fault you left
the book in the limo?

28:08.303 --> 28:11.966
It's your fault I was even in the limo.

28:12.140 --> 28:14.700
I can't even function
without my day planner.

28:14.876 --> 28:17.470
I'm trying to think of a reason
to keep on living.

28:17.645 --> 28:21.581
Still trying. Still trying.

28:21.750 --> 28:24.742
- You need to chill. You just need to relax.
- Relax?

28:25.053 --> 28:29.046
How am I supposed to relax?
My relaxation tapes are in my day planner!

28:34.028 --> 28:37.054
- Snap out of it!
- Don't hit me.

28:37.265 --> 28:42.225
Listen. Okay, your speech doesn't start until
3:00. That gives you three and a half hours!

28:44.304 --> 28:46.329
- Four and a half.
- Same thing.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.670
Roxy, spontaneity doesn't just happen.

28:49.843 --> 28:51.970
You have to get there and rehearse.

28:53.947 --> 28:56.415
Besides, where am I gonna
get cleaned up?

28:56.583 --> 28:58.278
I have a plan.

28:58.452 --> 28:59.817
Checking in, ladies?

28:59.987 --> 29:01.454
- We're with the band.
- Yeah.

29:01.622 --> 29:03.613
- Well, then.
- I'm Paris, this is Nicky.

29:03.791 --> 29:05.019
Welcome, Paris.

29:05.292 --> 29:07.886
- How could you let them go?
- Well, they're very smart.

29:08.062 --> 29:11.361
- One of them even spoke Chinese.
- I don't care.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.796
What's so important
about this stupid chip?

29:13.967 --> 29:17.698
That stupid chip contains millions of dollars
in pirated music.

29:17.871 --> 29:19.839
Pirate music? You mean:

29:21.375 --> 29:22.569
Bennie!

29:23.110 --> 29:25.806
Okay. I know what you mean.
I was just kidding.

29:25.979 --> 29:27.879
We send chip to Hong Kong...

29:28.048 --> 29:30.881
...they transfer it from chip
onto compact disk.

29:31.418 --> 29:35.320
They sell pirated copies,
and we make millions.

29:36.023 --> 29:38.924
Okay, I understand.

29:39.093 --> 29:42.654
I'll get the chip back
and restore honor to family.

29:43.263 --> 29:46.027
After all, I am your
number-one adopted son.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.795
Get chip, make compact disk,
sell to teenagers.

30:05.185 --> 30:06.447
What are we doing here?

30:06.620 --> 30:08.144
Watch and learn.

30:09.389 --> 30:10.617
I'd love to.

30:10.791 --> 30:15.057
But I'm presenting an award this afternoon.
You know that.

30:15.295 --> 30:17.695
Carey, come. Hurry, hurry.

30:19.566 --> 30:21.534
Now!

30:26.273 --> 30:28.138
This is your plan?

30:28.308 --> 30:30.299
Yep. And a pretty good one.

30:31.044 --> 30:36.004
Breaking into a hotel room is exactly how
Nixon went down. I'm not going in there.

30:36.183 --> 30:40.119
Not going in there.
I'm not going in there.

30:42.189 --> 30:44.453
Okay, I'm going in there.

30:45.325 --> 30:49.318
Okay, I'm just going to get cleaned up,
and then we're out of here.

30:49.496 --> 30:51.123
Clean up, get out.

30:54.468 --> 30:56.129
What?

30:57.171 --> 31:00.231
- It's a...
- Dog.

31:02.442 --> 31:04.376
I think.

31:05.045 --> 31:06.444
Well...

31:06.613 --> 31:08.547
...you take a shower first...

31:08.715 --> 31:11.411
...and I'll take the doggy.
Come on, puppy.

31:19.893 --> 31:22.487
- Jane Ryan speaking.
- I have your date book.

31:23.430 --> 31:25.295
- Roxy!
- What?

31:26.066 --> 31:29.058
- What?
- It's the psycho. He has my day planner.

31:29.236 --> 31:31.204
Let me... I'll talk to him.

31:31.371 --> 31:33.066
- Be nice.
- Okay.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.073
- Listen, you...
- I told you to be nice.

31:37.344 --> 31:38.572
You can take money...

31:38.745 --> 31:42.237
...you can have the credit cards,
just please don't hurt my speech.

31:42.416 --> 31:44.611
Shut up. I talk, you listen.

31:44.785 --> 31:47.618
- Okay. Good idea.
- You took my chip.

31:48.121 --> 31:49.986
Roxy, did you eat this man's chips?

31:50.324 --> 31:51.757
- No.
- You sure?

31:52.793 --> 31:55.921
- I didn't eat his chips.
- She didn't eat your chips.

31:56.530 --> 32:00.796
No, not chips. Chip. My microchip.

32:00.968 --> 32:03.402
Listen, we need that book back.

32:03.570 --> 32:08.769
So meet us outside the Plaza Hotel
in 30 minutes, or I will eat your chips.

32:32.899 --> 32:36.062
Found the chip!

32:48.682 --> 32:51.150
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.422
Is today my birthday?

33:03.330 --> 33:06.424
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
We're just leaving.

33:07.067 --> 33:09.695
- My sister.
- There's gonna be a five-alarm fire...

33:09.870 --> 33:13.067
...if my mom finds you.
- This psycho stole my day planner...

33:13.240 --> 33:17.074
...which has my entire life in it.
Now we have to give him his chip back.

33:17.244 --> 33:22.113
Okay, so psycho, day planner,
computer chip...

33:22.382 --> 33:24.247
Yeah, makes perfect sense to me.

33:24.551 --> 33:26.610
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:27.988 --> 33:31.116
But you might have a little trouble
swapping the chip.

33:31.291 --> 33:34.260
- Why?
- Because Reinaldo just ate it.

33:36.930 --> 33:39.296
No. No, he didn't.

33:39.466 --> 33:42.560
- Are you serious?
- The little green thing, he just ate it.

33:42.869 --> 33:45.133
- Spit it out. Come on.
- Hello?

33:45.305 --> 33:47.739
- Hello, Trey.
- Hi, Mom.

33:47.908 --> 33:50.240
I'm on my way up. Change of schedule.

33:50.410 --> 33:52.935
Bring my purse, dear.
I'm meeting Hillary at 1.

33:53.146 --> 33:54.943
Okay.

33:55.115 --> 33:57.606
All right. So my mom's on her way up.

33:57.851 --> 34:00.581
She's a senator. Anne Baxter Lipton.

34:02.155 --> 34:05.124
- A senator?
- Should've kept that little fact to yourself.

34:05.292 --> 34:06.520
- A senator.
- Yeah.

34:06.693 --> 34:08.717
I can never run for office now.

34:09.463 --> 34:12.056
- Come here, little puppy.
- I'll be right back.

34:12.466 --> 34:14.434
- Get it out.
- Shake it out.

34:14.601 --> 34:16.501
- Shake it out.
- Spit it out.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.297
- Hey, easy...
- A senator?

34:18.472 --> 34:20.496
- Come on.
- The dog ate the chip.

34:21.041 --> 34:23.100
I need the chip to get the day planner.

34:23.310 --> 34:25.641
- This isn't happening.
- He bit me!

34:25.812 --> 34:27.938
Calm down. I don't want it.

34:28.114 --> 34:29.742
Don't throw him.

34:32.619 --> 34:34.313
- Keep it!
- You take him!

34:37.391 --> 34:38.858
My bad.

34:40.726 --> 34:43.422
Oh, thank God. Reinaldo.

34:43.996 --> 34:47.694
Jane, what are you doing?
You're gonna wind up dead!

34:47.967 --> 34:50.266
Without that chip, I am dead.

34:50.469 --> 34:54.201
Okay. Come back here.
Come here, doggy.

34:54.373 --> 34:57.741
Okay. Here we go. Okay.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.678
Trey? Trey?

35:02.849 --> 35:04.714
- My mom.
- Why is the door locked?

35:04.885 --> 35:08.048
- I'll be late for the Simple Plan shoot.
- The video shoot?

35:08.221 --> 35:10.189
- Yeah.
- Trey? Hello?

35:10.357 --> 35:12.882
- At least tell me your name before you go.
- Roxy.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.186
- Roxy.
- Jane. Come here.

35:16.363 --> 35:19.298
I was taking a nap. Sorry.

35:20.066 --> 35:22.967
Look what I got my little boy for lunch.

35:23.136 --> 35:24.569
Thanks, Mom. I already ate.

35:25.505 --> 35:26.938
Reinaldo.

35:27.107 --> 35:30.838
Reinaldo, come here, boy.
Look what Mommy has for you.

35:31.011 --> 35:35.038
Come here, my precious little baby.
Where's my...? Come on.

35:35.215 --> 35:39.311
Look what Mommy has.
Reinaldo, don't make Mommy beg.

35:41.188 --> 35:43.850
- Hold on.
- Come here, doggy. Doggy.

35:44.024 --> 35:47.050
Trey. Where is Reinaldo?
He always answers when I call.

35:47.227 --> 35:48.660
He's not answering.

35:48.829 --> 35:52.162
Come here, doggy.
So I can stick my finger down your throat.

35:52.666 --> 35:56.397
Whatever you do, don't look down.

35:57.971 --> 36:00.940
Mom, there's something
you should know, okay?

36:01.107 --> 36:04.440
Now, Reinaldo, he...

36:05.545 --> 36:07.342
I took him to the groomer's.

36:07.581 --> 36:09.048
Why would you do that?

36:09.249 --> 36:12.616
Because he smelled.

36:16.122 --> 36:19.057
- Don't worry. We're getting out of here.
- I can't move.

36:19.226 --> 36:23.526
Oh, God, I almost forgot. I gotta go.
I gotta... Yeah. I'm going to be late.

36:23.697 --> 36:25.631
Don't forget to pick up Reinaldo.

36:25.799 --> 36:27.426
Give me the dog.

36:30.470 --> 36:33.997
Deals like this are the result of years
of really hard work.

36:34.174 --> 36:37.439
Things don't just fall out of the sky.

36:37.611 --> 36:39.545
- How you doing?
- Going down!

36:58.265 --> 37:00.756
- That wasn't so bad.
- No.

37:01.635 --> 37:03.899
Can I have my towel, please?

37:11.912 --> 37:13.140
- Sir, I need your help.
- Yes, sir.

37:13.313 --> 37:15.281
Help me find a dog
and two girls in towels.

37:15.448 --> 37:17.439
Who exactly are they?

37:17.617 --> 37:21.053
Okay, puppy. Okay. Go home.
You need to go home.

37:21.221 --> 37:23.121
- What are you doing?
- We need to go.

37:23.290 --> 37:24.518
No, we need that dog.

37:24.691 --> 37:28.149
That dog is my life. And when he poops,
his poop is my life.

37:28.328 --> 37:30.956
Come on, Reinaldo! Come on.

37:31.131 --> 37:34.328
- Good puppy. Okay.
- Can anything else go wrong today?

37:41.875 --> 37:45.106
- Am I squashing you?
- Yeah. It's great.

37:45.378 --> 37:48.814
- Did I just...?
- Yeah. You just said that out loud.

37:48.982 --> 37:53.510
If we keep bumping into each other like
this, one of us is gonna get hurt.

37:53.687 --> 37:55.382
I'm willing to take that chance.

37:55.555 --> 37:58.023
- Roxy!
- Paris! Nicky!

37:58.191 --> 38:01.957
- How can I find you?
- Call her. 555-8989.

38:02.128 --> 38:03.993
She's home every night.

38:04.164 --> 38:06.223
- What's your name?
- It's Jane.

38:06.399 --> 38:07.627
I'm Jim!

39:17.437 --> 39:20.031
Here. How am I gonna survive
without my watch?

39:20.306 --> 39:21.898
I don't know.

39:22.375 --> 39:27.142
Come on. You can poopy.
Just a little one. Come on.

39:27.781 --> 39:29.112
Any luck?

39:30.483 --> 39:32.474
Think we have something.

39:35.188 --> 39:37.554
- False alarm.
- I can't go looking like this.

39:37.724 --> 39:41.251
- I'm starting to have heart palpitations.
- No, don't worry, okay?

39:41.428 --> 39:43.896
We're gonna fix you up. I promise.

39:45.598 --> 39:49.432
It's all gonna work out.
Where are you going?

39:49.669 --> 39:51.102
To get my day planner back.

39:52.639 --> 39:54.266
- I'll go with you.
- No.

39:55.008 --> 39:57.238
I don't think that's such a good idea.

39:57.410 --> 40:00.402
Our togetherness today
hasn't exactly been good luck.

40:01.881 --> 40:03.143
Rox, I'll be fine.

40:03.516 --> 40:06.451
It's in front of the Plaza.
There's a lot of witnesses.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.951
It's not like this guy's exactly,
like, a criminal mastermind.

40:10.123 --> 40:12.148
So have fun at the concert.

40:13.026 --> 40:14.493
Video shoot.

40:15.695 --> 40:19.324
59th and Ninth. If you care.

40:31.911 --> 40:34.072
Okay, kiddies.

40:34.247 --> 40:36.181
Playtime's over.

40:39.552 --> 40:41.383
Where do you think you're going?

40:41.554 --> 40:44.352
I'm on a case.
Where do you think you're going?

40:44.691 --> 40:47.057
What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

40:47.227 --> 40:48.990
So we're clear on that.

40:49.162 --> 40:51.596
Yeah. I didn't think so.

40:58.271 --> 41:00.239
Jeff. What's up, man? It's Trey.

41:00.406 --> 41:04.240
Hey, you remember that Simple Plan
video shoot you were telling me about?

41:04.410 --> 41:07.777
Yeah. Where is it?
It's 59th and Ninth. Are you sure?

41:07.947 --> 41:11.075
That's awesome, man. You rock.
I owe you. Bye.

41:11.684 --> 41:15.552
Boy, talk about anal-retentive.
This girl is a cuckoo bird.

41:18.725 --> 41:23.719
I'm surprised she doesn't have trips to the
bathroom scheduled. Wait, right here, 3:30.

41:24.030 --> 41:27.090
- Look, I think we...
- You're late.

41:27.801 --> 41:30.497
I think we got off on the wrong foot
a while back.

41:30.670 --> 41:32.934
I just wanna know... Okay.

41:36.676 --> 41:38.041
Give me my chip.

41:39.345 --> 41:41.040
- What's this?
- It's your chip.

41:41.214 --> 41:44.741
- Excuse me?
- Well, you see, Reinaldo here...

41:45.084 --> 41:47.348
...he ate your chip.
- Reinaldo ate my chip.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.681
- Is this some kind of joke?
- I don't joke.

41:49.856 --> 41:51.483
Can I have my day planner back?

41:51.658 --> 41:55.594
You know what I think I do?
I think I run over the dog with the car.

41:55.762 --> 41:58.560
No, wait, that might damage the chip.

41:58.731 --> 42:01.928
You give me my chip, or I'll kill you!
Cough it up, pooch.

42:02.635 --> 42:04.262
No, no. Please don't hurt him.

42:04.437 --> 42:06.234
Give it to me. Let me have it!

42:09.175 --> 42:10.403
Good shot, Reinaldo.

42:15.081 --> 42:16.708
Disgusting!

42:29.929 --> 42:33.456
Mike one, check. Testing, one, two.
One, two.

42:33.633 --> 42:35.567
Excuse me, fellas.

42:35.735 --> 42:38.499
Excuse me, Cochise. Thattaboy.

42:38.905 --> 42:41.931
- I'm so excited.
- Thanks.

42:42.108 --> 42:44.406
- You're good.
- Roxy.

42:46.246 --> 42:47.907
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:48.948 --> 42:52.543
I was wondering if you knew
where my mom's dog was.

42:52.719 --> 42:56.951
But I mean, I also wanted
to see you again.

42:58.191 --> 42:59.249
Come on! Move it!

42:59.425 --> 43:02.019
- Do you have a pass?
- No.

43:02.195 --> 43:04.459
I'll be right back, okay?
So just stay here.

43:04.631 --> 43:07.657
- I'll figure it out.
- Figure it out somewhere else, okay?

43:10.103 --> 43:11.832
Simple Plan.

43:12.005 --> 43:13.768
They rock.

43:17.243 --> 43:19.677
Got all their LPs.

43:21.648 --> 43:25.448
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
Is it Loser?

43:26.920 --> 43:28.512
How come you're not in school?

43:28.922 --> 43:32.949
Okay, okay. Don't worry.
I've got bigger fish to fry.

43:33.393 --> 43:36.954
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Thanks for coming to this video shoot.

43:37.130 --> 43:39.655
We're gonna need
a lot of your energy today.

43:39.866 --> 43:42.562
So are you guys ready?

43:42.735 --> 43:44.225
Are we ready?

43:44.404 --> 43:45.632
Rox, where are you?

43:45.805 --> 43:49.741
This is the scene live in midtown,
where punk-rock group Simple Plan...

43:49.909 --> 43:53.345
...is shooting their latest music video.
- A little louder!

43:54.247 --> 43:58.843
Nice. Get ready. Welcome, Simple Plan!

44:03.389 --> 44:07.018
What's up, New York City?

44:55.141 --> 44:56.972
Old-school dance moves.

45:13.026 --> 45:16.484
Hi. Please give it a listen.
Our contact info's inside.

45:16.662 --> 45:19.096
- Nice packaging. Let's take a look.
- Thanks.

45:19.265 --> 45:21.631
Hello, Miss Ryan.

45:21.901 --> 45:26.065
So nice to finally meet you face to face.

45:26.639 --> 45:29.699
It's been quite a chase
all these years, huh?

45:29.942 --> 45:34.174
One not without a few clever maneuvers
on your part...

45:34.347 --> 45:38.784
...but here we are.
- You know what? I'm tired of running.

45:38.985 --> 45:43.319
- I'll go quietly.
- I don't use handcuffs, Miss Ryan.

45:44.090 --> 45:47.526
- Just brains.
- But before we go, Mr. Lomax...

45:47.693 --> 45:49.661
- Yeah?
- Check your fly.

45:49.829 --> 45:51.660
What's that?

45:56.302 --> 45:59.863
- I have to get by.
- Where do you think you're going?

46:00.373 --> 46:02.705
You may want to check your fly.

46:23.830 --> 46:25.127
Roxy!

46:30.470 --> 46:31.869
Hey, man, what's up?

46:35.908 --> 46:37.808
It's Lomax.

46:37.977 --> 46:40.343
Everybody, jump. Jump!

46:47.887 --> 46:49.149
Roxy!

47:10.977 --> 47:12.911
- Lomax!
- Lomax?

47:13.079 --> 47:14.706
Lomax?

47:15.314 --> 47:17.282
- We're trapped.
- Take my hand.

47:34.667 --> 47:36.259
Roxy?

47:38.437 --> 47:39.734
Roxy!

47:43.442 --> 47:45.740
Has everybody washed their hands?

47:49.415 --> 47:51.315
I'm next!

47:57.456 --> 47:59.356
That's gotta hurt.

48:02.028 --> 48:05.987
Sorry about that. Sorry. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, guys. Excuse me.

48:06.232 --> 48:09.998
I'm looking for two girls and this little dog
that just ran out of here.

48:10.169 --> 48:12.603
- Did you see where they went?
- I did.

48:12.772 --> 48:15.673
- They went to the Simple Plan after-party.
- Great.

48:15.841 --> 48:18.833
You know, I'm going there now.
I drive all the VIPs.

48:19.011 --> 48:22.777
- I could give you a ride.
- Yeah? Thanks, man.

48:22.949 --> 48:24.541
Thanks.

48:29.655 --> 48:31.782
- This Lomax guy is crazy.
- I know.

48:38.297 --> 48:39.525
Okay.

48:39.699 --> 48:42.259
- Let's hide in the tent.
- Okay.

48:50.409 --> 48:52.434
Cover up the manhole. We're done here.

48:53.546 --> 48:54.945
Give me a hand!

48:58.684 --> 49:01.881
The climactic event
of my academic career is in two hours.

49:02.054 --> 49:05.455
And I'm drenched with a dog
in a sewer. Yeah.

49:05.625 --> 49:08.116
No. See, we're in luck.
It's just the water main.

49:09.695 --> 49:14.655
- I'm just trying to look on the bright side.
- Bright side? There is no bright side.

49:15.368 --> 49:18.997
Well, I don't know. I was thinking that...

49:19.205 --> 49:20.433
That what?

49:20.706 --> 49:25.006
We haven't spent
the day together in years.

49:25.511 --> 49:30.380
And today has made me realize
how much I've missed that.

49:30.783 --> 49:33.513
And I don't know, I was having fun.

49:33.753 --> 49:36.813
And you were too, because I saw
the smile on your face...

49:36.989 --> 49:39.150
...when we were crowd surfing.

49:39.325 --> 49:44.228
- I was acting for the cameras.
- Just a little bit.

49:44.797 --> 49:47.823
Okay, so maybe it was a little fun.

49:48.834 --> 49:51.826
- What's with that Lomax guy?
- He's the truant officer.

49:52.004 --> 49:55.940
He's been after me for years,
but I outsmart him every time.

49:56.142 --> 49:57.837
What can I say?

49:58.577 --> 50:00.340
You're insane. You know that?

50:00.746 --> 50:02.611
Yeah. I know.

50:08.187 --> 50:09.950
You okay, buddy?

50:10.222 --> 50:13.020
Yeah, I'm doing just fine,
Sherlock. Yourself?

50:13.192 --> 50:16.059
Wife and kids? Think it'll rain?
How about those Mets?

50:16.228 --> 50:18.423
Are we through chitchatting?

50:18.597 --> 50:20.497
Tell me where this sewer pipe leads?

50:20.766 --> 50:24.258
Well, that one there comes directly
from the main line on 125th.

50:24.637 --> 50:27.003
Only way in or out.

50:33.045 --> 50:36.105
- How's the patient?
- She should've gone for the C-section.

50:36.482 --> 50:39.144
I'm gonna miss my daughter's speech
at Columbia.

50:39.318 --> 50:41.946
She's gonna be so disappointed.
I hope she's okay.

50:46.058 --> 50:49.960
The unpublicized event has drawn
quite a crowd here today.

50:50.162 --> 50:52.323
Come on, move off the road. Please?

51:02.408 --> 51:04.342
Hi, it's Jane. Leave a message.

51:04.543 --> 51:07.307
Jane. Hey, it's Jim.

51:07.546 --> 51:12.074
The guy that ripped your skirt
and pummeled you with his bike.

51:12.518 --> 51:14.042
Sorry about that.

51:15.287 --> 51:19.383
Anyway, I was just calling
to make sure you're okay.

51:19.759 --> 51:21.624
So...

51:22.495 --> 51:26.022
I'll keep looking for you.
I'm gonna make it up to you. All right?

51:26.399 --> 51:28.094
See you.

51:30.336 --> 51:33.669
We need to get out of here.
This thing is never-ending.

51:33.873 --> 51:36.535
Wait a sec. Columbia's
on 116th Street, right?

51:36.709 --> 51:38.404
Right.

51:38.711 --> 51:40.144
I got you nine blocks away.

51:48.454 --> 51:51.150
She can't get a date
because she sounds fat...

51:51.323 --> 51:53.348
What's up with this fool?

51:54.760 --> 51:56.853
White people are crazy.

51:57.730 --> 51:59.561
Roxy, Columbia's on the West Side.

52:04.937 --> 52:08.532
- Here we are. Let's find a subway.
- Let's ask the House of Bling.

52:08.707 --> 52:10.174
Good idea.

52:16.081 --> 52:19.482
- Can I help you?
- We are so not in Kansas anymore.

52:21.987 --> 52:24.615
We're from the gas company.

52:25.157 --> 52:27.955
- No gas here. Okay.
- Hold it.

52:28.127 --> 52:32.496
I can't have anyone seeing you leave
my store looking like that.

52:32.665 --> 52:35.691
- Mickey, show them out the back way.
- Okay, Ma.

52:36.268 --> 52:38.202
Oh, come on.

52:39.371 --> 52:42.499
- What? What is it?
- It's 1:13.

52:42.675 --> 52:45.109
It's 1:13. I'm never gonna make it.

52:45.277 --> 52:46.744
What's wrong with that girl?

52:46.912 --> 52:51.508
- She doesn't do well under pressure.
- Oh, my God! I'm having a heart attack!

52:51.684 --> 52:53.413
- Call 991. Call 991.
- Breathe.

52:53.586 --> 52:56.077
Call 991! 991?

52:56.255 --> 52:57.779
Stay calm!

52:59.558 --> 53:01.287
Thank you. I'm not thirsty.

53:01.460 --> 53:04.395
It's okay. Breathe. Breathe. Deep breaths.

53:04.563 --> 53:06.963
Happy thoughts. Sing with me, okay?

53:33.993 --> 53:36.257
- You okay?
- Works every time.

53:36.529 --> 53:38.429
Dang, what's that all about?

53:38.697 --> 53:43.066
In two hours, I'm supposed to make
the most important speech of my life.

53:43.235 --> 53:44.463
It's been a rough day.

53:44.737 --> 53:48.264
Sweetheart, if it was all smooth sailing,
you know where we'd be?

53:48.440 --> 53:51.739
- Bored to tears, that's what.
- Amen.

53:51.911 --> 53:54.971
Take this sister over here.
Come here, baby.

53:55.147 --> 53:58.913
Good. It's the curve balls
that make life interesting.

53:59.084 --> 54:00.642
Shows us what we're made of.

54:00.853 --> 54:03.981
And sometimes, if we're real lucky...

54:04.156 --> 54:08.115
...there's a blessing waiting for us
at the end of that wrong turn.

54:08.327 --> 54:11.125
Well, what if there's been
about 50 wrong turns?

54:11.297 --> 54:14.027
That last wrong turn brought you
in here, didn't it?

54:14.199 --> 54:16.929
So prepare to be blessed.

54:17.102 --> 54:21.038
Mickey. Bring me my toolbox.
We got some major bling to do.

54:21.840 --> 54:25.435
- Who's Major Bling?
- Honey, this is Big Shirl's House of Bling.

54:25.678 --> 54:29.136
This is where the bling is born.
This is where bling lives.

54:29.315 --> 54:31.283
You got nothing to worry about.

54:39.625 --> 54:43.652
Just so we're clear,
I'd like a more corporate bling.

55:09.888 --> 55:13.085
Boy, you is filthy.
What am I gonna do with you?

55:30.909 --> 55:34.845
Boyfriend. Well, you girlfriend now.

55:48.127 --> 55:51.358
New York Knicks, baby! New York Knicks!

56:07.079 --> 56:09.570
- You look so hot.
- I feel hot.

56:09.748 --> 56:11.943
Sisters got some sister in them!

56:12.484 --> 56:14.281
Y'all good to go.

56:34.106 --> 56:36.370
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome.

56:36.542 --> 56:39.511
- I promise we'll pay you back.
- Honey, it's on the house.

56:39.678 --> 56:40.906
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.308
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

56:42.481 --> 56:44.608
- All right.
- I think I can pull this off.

56:44.783 --> 56:47.843
Hello? Oh, it's for you.

56:48.053 --> 56:49.418
Hello? Jane Ryan speaking.

56:49.588 --> 56:51.818
I have your boyfriend.

56:52.091 --> 56:55.527
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- Then I have your sister's boyfriend.

56:55.794 --> 56:58.285
My sister doesn't
have a boyfriend, either.

56:58.464 --> 57:01.865
Okay, look. Whatever.
I'm through with being Mr. Softy.

57:02.101 --> 57:06.003
You meet me in Times Square
at corner of 47th and Broadway...

57:06.171 --> 57:10.039
...in 20 minutes,
or else I will burn your book.

57:10.576 --> 57:11.838
He's gonna burn my book.

57:12.010 --> 57:14.808
He's not gonna burn your book.
That's censorship.

57:17.249 --> 57:19.479
- We have to go.
- Well, let's go.

57:19.651 --> 57:21.141
We need a ride, Big Shirl.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.185
- Mickey, get your cab.
- Not now, Ma.

57:23.355 --> 57:24.947
- Around the corner.
- Thank you!

57:25.124 --> 57:28.890
- Be careful. All right. See you.
- Roxanne Ryan. Cease and desist!

57:30.729 --> 57:32.128
Who's that cracker?

57:34.933 --> 57:36.992
I don't know.
He ain't from around here.

57:37.669 --> 57:39.500
Hurry, get in the car!

57:40.405 --> 57:42.202
Okay.

57:44.543 --> 57:46.408
Jane, start the car.

57:46.578 --> 57:49.138
I'm not exactly a strong driver.

57:53.018 --> 57:55.179
Step out of the car, Ryan. It's all over.

57:55.354 --> 57:58.414
- What do I do?
- Brake, left. Gas, right. Go!

58:05.697 --> 58:07.255
Watch out for the guy!

58:07.432 --> 58:08.797
- Slow down!
- Sorry!

58:09.568 --> 58:11.399
- Braking. Red.
- I know.

58:11.570 --> 58:12.901
Stop!

58:19.378 --> 58:22.939
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
I'm taking over your vehicle.

58:24.983 --> 58:26.678
- Okey-dokey.
- What fun.

58:26.919 --> 58:29.114
Tim Brooger. My wife, Steffi.

58:29.288 --> 58:31.950
- Pleased to meet you.
- Buckle up. Could be bumpy.

58:40.532 --> 58:43.433
How you got your driver's license
is beyond me.

58:44.102 --> 58:48.061
You didn't? You failed your driver's test?
That's incredible.

58:48.240 --> 58:53.234
I got 100 percent on the written.
I just didn't quite pass the driving part.

58:54.413 --> 58:57.041
- Are we gonna be in a car chase?
- Don't tell me.

58:57.216 --> 59:00.014
- We've never been in a car chase.
- No, sir. Not one.

59:00.185 --> 59:03.586
- Seen them on TV.
- I think New York has the best car chases.

59:03.755 --> 59:06.417
- Oh, shoot...
- Small favor, Clem. Put a sock in it.

59:06.592 --> 59:08.560
Done, sir.

59:08.727 --> 59:11.594
- Where is he? Is he behind us?
- Yeah.

59:15.067 --> 59:19.026
We drove all the way from Minnetonka,
Minnesota just to see New York City.

59:19.204 --> 59:21.035
The Big Apple.

59:21.206 --> 59:25.870
- They say it's the city that never sleeps.
- I think it will now that you've hit town.

59:27.112 --> 59:29.637
- Red light, red light!
- I know!

59:30.015 --> 59:31.346
Red!

59:32.851 --> 59:35.183
I read the rule book.
I know what red means.

59:35.721 --> 59:38.690
Hi. I need to go to 112th...

59:39.524 --> 59:41.424
Go! Floor it!

59:43.228 --> 59:45.287
- Oh, God!
- What are you doing here?

59:46.131 --> 59:48.326
God, that is so hot!

59:53.972 --> 59:56.167
Would you give me just a little air?

59:56.341 --> 59:59.538
- I can't do this.
- You can do this. Breathe.

01:00:01.446 --> 01:00:03.710
- I'm getting killed.
- Stop it.

01:00:06.118 --> 01:00:07.346
Whoopsy-daisy!

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:10.545
- Can you drive a little bit faster?
- Do you want to drive?

01:00:10.722 --> 01:00:12.019
I'll drive!

01:00:12.824 --> 01:00:16.385
I don't know if this would be helpful,
but we do have a loudspeaker.

01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:21.089
Sure, we use that for campfire sing-alongs
with our church group.

01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:25.333
Testing. Testing, one, two.
Can this be heard?

01:00:25.504 --> 01:00:27.870
- Roxanne Ryan, this is the law.
- Go!

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.634
- Pull over. Give yourself up.
- I'm being abducted!

01:00:30.809 --> 01:00:34.301
You think I'm kidding. I'm not.
You're only making things worse.

01:00:34.479 --> 01:00:38.415
You'll be in detention the rest of your life.
So let's end this right now.

01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:40.551
- This is kind of fun.
- It's not fun!

01:00:40.719 --> 01:00:42.550
Where'd he go?

01:00:43.055 --> 01:00:44.352
I think we lost him.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.615
You might wanna look to your right.

01:00:47.826 --> 01:00:51.592
Okay, playtime's over, Ryan.
Let's put the toys away and go home.

01:00:51.863 --> 01:00:53.490
- Pull over!
- Turn right here.

01:00:57.035 --> 01:00:58.662
You're going the wrong way!

01:00:58.837 --> 01:01:02.170
- I thought you said right here.
- Times Square's the other right.

01:01:02.341 --> 01:01:03.706
I have it under control.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:06.309
Yeah, right. Then where are we going?

01:01:06.545 --> 01:01:08.012
What are you doing?

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.116
Signaling. I know the rules.
Hang on, people.

01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:14.752
Why are we reversing?
It's a one-way street!

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:19.515
- We're going the wrong way.
- No, but we're facing the right way.

01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:23.092
- You're mine now, Ryan.
- It's too tight. We're not gonna make it.

01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:25.752
- We'll make it.
- We're not gonna make it!

01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:29.628
- Who's the professional here, you or me?
- I wanna say you.

01:01:30.435 --> 01:01:31.925
Go!

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.439
Look, there's a gate!

01:01:42.214 --> 01:01:43.442
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:58.387
- Take some of that.
- Are you trying to kill us?

01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:03.125
I just saved your life,
and you're criticizing me?

01:02:03.335 --> 01:02:06.099
- Welcome to my world.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:08.432
It means you're always
looking down on me.

01:02:08.607 --> 01:02:10.507
- Looking down on you?
- Yeah.

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:12.609
I've been looking out for you.

01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:15.912
Hey. Let me out of this car!

01:02:21.353 --> 01:02:23.321
Thanks for nothing!

01:02:23.488 --> 01:02:28.892
- How have you been looking out for me?
- Are you insane? That's all I ever do!

01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:32.895
The one day, the one time I want it
to be about me for a change...

01:02:33.065 --> 01:02:36.728
...I get inducted into the Roxy Ryan
School of Juvenile Delinquency.

01:02:36.902 --> 01:02:39.996
I've been trying to help you
from the minute we left.

01:02:40.172 --> 01:02:42.106
Lot of good that's done.

01:02:42.574 --> 01:02:45.509
Where are you going? I'm not finished.

01:02:45.677 --> 01:02:47.304
Yeah, well, I am.

01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:51.380
Why don't you run along and have fun.
That's what you're good at.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:55.987
As opposed to you, which is walking away
whenever we have a real conversation?

01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:58.917
I don't have time for a real conversation.

01:02:59.124 --> 01:03:02.150
- I'm too busy taking care of things.
- So who asked you to?

01:03:02.327 --> 01:03:06.821
You did. The minute you stopped taking
responsibility for anything since Mom died.

01:03:06.998 --> 01:03:09.489
That doesn't mean you get
to be her replacement.

01:03:12.504 --> 01:03:14.768
You know what I miss most about Mom?

01:03:15.073 --> 01:03:17.803
Is that she loved that we were different.

01:03:18.009 --> 01:03:21.308
And you punish me for it.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.307
From the day Mom died...

01:03:24.483 --> 01:03:27.509
...you've done nothing but push me
out of your life.

01:03:27.719 --> 01:03:30.586
- I have not.
- Oh, come on, Jane.

01:03:31.189 --> 01:03:35.990
The biggest day of your academic career,
and you didn't even bother to invite me.

01:03:37.662 --> 01:03:41.496
Well, forgive me for wanting the day
to be about me for a change.

01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:45.694
I make honor roll, Dad doesn't notice
because you're in detention.

01:03:46.004 --> 01:03:50.168
I'm captain of the cheerleading squad,
and Dad can't come to one game.

01:03:50.475 --> 01:03:54.912
One game, because he's busy going
to your parent/counselor meetings.

01:03:56.381 --> 01:03:59.248
You wanna know why I want
this fellowship abroad?

01:03:59.518 --> 01:04:02.351
It's because it's 3000 miles
away from you.

01:04:08.827 --> 01:04:11.193
Well, I really hope you get it, then.

01:05:51.396 --> 01:05:52.624
Roxy.

01:06:04.442 --> 01:06:08.344
Don't you worry. I'm not going to let
the mean little man hurt you.

01:06:09.147 --> 01:06:11.980
Hey, I don't know who you are
or what your game is...

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:15.313
...but you've caused me a great deal
of inconvenience today.

01:06:15.487 --> 01:06:18.320
Not to mention, I am this close
to missing my speech.

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:20.583
So let's have it. Let's have it.

01:06:21.493 --> 01:06:22.926
You finished?

01:06:25.397 --> 01:06:29.390
Ancient Chinese proverb:
You snooze, you lose.

01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:32.866
- Anyone, help!
- Let's take her to Ma.

01:06:47.819 --> 01:06:49.684
Perfect timing.

01:06:50.021 --> 01:06:51.249
Hello!

01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:53.220
Help!

01:06:53.391 --> 01:06:54.619
Help!

01:06:54.959 --> 01:06:56.517
- Help me!
- Hello?

01:06:56.695 --> 01:06:58.390
Roxy?

01:06:58.563 --> 01:07:00.224
- Trey?
- Yeah.

01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:04.129
- What are you doing in there?
- Can we talk after you open the trunk?

01:07:05.603 --> 01:07:08.470
- Thanks.
- Are you okay? What happened?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.475
I'm coming to find you, next thing I know,
this limo guy just shoves me in there.

01:07:13.645 --> 01:07:16.136
Just when you think the day
can't get any worse.

01:07:20.518 --> 01:07:23.453
- You okay?
- I just got in a huge fight with my sister.

01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:27.284
She was gonna give a speech today.
Now she won't win the fellowship...

01:07:27.459 --> 01:07:31.486
...because there's no way she's getting
there on time, and it's all my fault.

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.691
You sure about that?

01:07:40.038 --> 01:07:43.940
- Do you wanna take a field trip right now?
- Yeah.

01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:45.938
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:07:46.111 --> 01:07:47.806
Taxi!

01:07:52.417 --> 01:07:57.184
Now, it's just you and me.

01:07:57.355 --> 01:08:01.416
All alone. No excuses.

01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:06.593
Come on. Drink this.

01:08:06.765 --> 01:08:09.029
Drink this, and then the chip
will come out.

01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:13.361
This goes in here, chip come out here.

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.930
I'm not kidding around. Drink it.

01:08:16.608 --> 01:08:18.098
See?

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:22.337
Like that. Hey, that's pretty good.

01:08:24.682 --> 01:08:26.046
Come on.

01:08:27.752 --> 01:08:30.050
This movie isn't out yet.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:34.113
Neither is this CD.

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:37.456
So that's what these guys are up to.

01:08:38.296 --> 01:08:42.892
Just listen to me. Give me that chip.
You don't want me to use this, do you?

01:08:43.067 --> 01:08:45.796
I don't even know what this is.

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.063
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

01:08:48.606 --> 01:08:50.631
Now, give me the chip!

01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:52.970
Look into my eyes.

01:08:53.478 --> 01:08:56.037
I'm torturing you.

01:08:56.413 --> 01:08:58.245
It's unbearable!

01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:02.250
Bennie! This is your idea of torture?

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:04.520
It's pathetic!

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:06.953
We do it my way.

01:09:07.358 --> 01:09:09.121
Cats have nine lives.

01:09:09.794 --> 01:09:13.252
I wonder if little doggy does.

01:09:17.202 --> 01:09:19.898
Okay. I hope they haven't started.

01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:21.800
I can't run in these heels.

01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:25.170
The increase and/or decrease
in a nation's productivity...

01:09:25.343 --> 01:09:27.402
...or other such political aggregate...

01:09:27.578 --> 01:09:30.877
...can be regarded as the penultimate
indicator of a nation...

01:09:33.283 --> 01:09:37.050
Go see what she's doing.
Make her stop! Go.

01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:40.089
Cut it out in there! You make a mess,
you clean it up.

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:46.890
Sorry!

01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:50.066
- He bit me!
- Get it off of me!

01:09:50.234 --> 01:09:52.066
Come on, Reinaldo. Come on!

01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:54.568
Come on.

01:10:06.284 --> 01:10:08.775
- Hey, stranger.
- Would you like to save my life?

01:10:08.953 --> 01:10:12.081
- I have 28 minutes to go 111 blocks.
- I could do that.

01:10:12.257 --> 01:10:15.784
- Where'd they go?
- Bennie, where are they? Let's go!

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.053
- Okay.
- Hold on.

01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:24.395
Hold on, okay?

01:10:27.872 --> 01:10:29.339
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:10:40.685 --> 01:10:42.243
This is it.

01:10:44.923 --> 01:10:46.788
I don't see her.

01:10:47.825 --> 01:10:49.588
Jane Ryan?

01:10:50.728 --> 01:10:53.993
- Yeah?
- You're late. You're on next.

01:10:54.999 --> 01:10:57.593
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- Look...

01:10:57.769 --> 01:11:00.431
...I got her into this mess,
I have to get her out.

01:11:00.705 --> 01:11:04.698
Plus, how hard could it be reading
a bunch of note cards?

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:06.844
Just go with me on this one.

01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:09.775
Okay, yeah. You're gonna do great.

01:11:20.992 --> 01:11:25.258
- All right. See you out there. Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:11:32.804 --> 01:11:36.296
Nice blazer, Muffie.

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:41.868
Oh, gridlock!

01:11:42.046 --> 01:11:44.310
- Do you have a horn?
- We'll take a shortcut.

01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:47.281
Hey, what are you doing?

01:11:47.452 --> 01:11:49.477
Sorry.

01:11:49.988 --> 01:11:51.216
Excuse us.

01:11:52.657 --> 01:11:54.522
- Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.855
In this instance, we must defer to the
famed economist, Adam Smith...

01:12:00.398 --> 01:12:03.128
...who laid the foundation of a free market.

01:12:07.839 --> 01:12:09.534
Mother.

01:12:09.974 --> 01:12:11.373
What are you doing here?

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:16.871
I'm honorary chair of the McGill Fellowship.
What are you doing here?

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:21.677
- I wanted to see you present the award.
- Well, that's very sweet.

01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:25.186
Our last finalist is from Long Island
and has a 4.2 GPA.

01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:29.484
She's student-body president
and captain of her cheerleading squad.

01:12:29.661 --> 01:12:32.391
Please welcome Jane Ryan.

01:12:43.775 --> 01:12:45.242
Keep it together. It's okay.

01:12:56.921 --> 01:12:58.183
Oh, my God.

01:13:00.191 --> 01:13:02.022
You may proceed...

01:13:02.193 --> 01:13:04.627
...Miss Ryan.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.635
- Please.
- Right.

01:13:14.272 --> 01:13:16.069
Oh, man.

01:13:21.279 --> 01:13:22.541
Well...

01:13:22.947 --> 01:13:27.145
...as many of you all know...

01:13:27.318 --> 01:13:29.513
...the economy is...

01:13:29.687 --> 01:13:33.054
...very, very important to all of us.

01:13:34.092 --> 01:13:36.322
Take the word "economy."

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:42.760
You have "eco,"
which stands for environment.

01:13:43.034 --> 01:13:46.003
You know, which we're all
real big supporters of.

01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:50.663
And we have "onomy," which...

01:13:51.309 --> 01:13:53.140
...is pig Latin for "money."

01:13:55.179 --> 01:13:57.670
Money, economy.

01:13:58.049 --> 01:13:59.277
Right.

01:14:14.532 --> 01:14:17.262
- Go, go, go. Good luck.
- Okay.

01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:21.797
- Are you coming? Come on.
- Yeah.

01:14:30.715 --> 01:14:32.649
Well...

01:14:32.817 --> 01:14:34.944
...for as the...

01:14:35.119 --> 01:14:40.716
...the famous,
famous Canadian professor...

01:14:40.892 --> 01:14:43.452
...Avril Lavigne...

01:14:43.628 --> 01:14:46.062
...stein once said, and I quote:

01:14:47.231 --> 01:14:50.223
"Why'd you have to go and make things
so complicated?

01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:56.173
I see the way you're acting, like you're
somebody else, gets me frustrated.

01:14:56.941 --> 01:14:59.967
Life's like this:
You fall, and you crawl...

01:15:00.144 --> 01:15:03.705
...and you break, and you take
what you can get.

01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:05.542
You turn it into honesty...

01:15:05.716 --> 01:15:09.015
...and promise me I'm never
gonna find you fake it.

01:15:10.321 --> 01:15:13.347
No. No.

01:15:14.158 --> 01:15:15.557
No."

01:15:23.835 --> 01:15:26.065
- Oh, thank God.
- Roxy?

01:15:26.237 --> 01:15:30.003
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that's all the time I have for... So...

01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:33.439
...will the real Jane Ryan please stand up?

01:15:38.216 --> 01:15:40.047
Reinaldo!

01:15:40.218 --> 01:15:42.083
Trey, what is going on?

01:15:43.855 --> 01:15:46.085
Apparently, the dog groomer delivers.

01:15:48.359 --> 01:15:49.986
Are you okay?

01:15:50.161 --> 01:15:52.254
What are you doing here?

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:55.456
Well, aside from completely
humiliating myself...

01:15:55.633 --> 01:15:58.124
I'm sorry. I wanted to read
the speech for you...

01:15:58.302 --> 01:16:02.534
No. Please. Here. I can take it from here.

01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:04.766
Are you sure?

01:16:06.344 --> 01:16:09.836
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Jane Ryan.

01:16:12.884 --> 01:16:14.613
Roxy, behind you!

01:16:14.785 --> 01:16:16.810
Nassau County Department of Truancy.

01:16:16.988 --> 01:16:19.456
This girl, Roxanne Ryan,
is now in my custody.

01:16:19.624 --> 01:16:23.958
And that girl, Jane Ryan, is an accomplice
in her criminal activities!

01:16:24.128 --> 01:16:26.153
And she stole my stupid ugly mutt too.

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:29.731
I don't know what is going on here,
but that "mutt" is mine.

01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:31.129
Come here, ugly doggy.

01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:34.931
- And I order you to give him back.
- Yeah, you and what army, lady?

01:16:37.275 --> 01:16:39.038
- Officer!
- Me?

01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:41.041
Arrest that man!

01:16:42.546 --> 01:16:43.808
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:43.981 --> 01:16:45.471
Oh, my baby.

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:48.950
Fly.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.382
Every time.

01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:54.351
- Hey, that's my mom's dog!
- I think it started.

01:16:56.661 --> 01:16:58.788
It doesn't look like Cats.

01:17:00.531 --> 01:17:01.896
Everybody, freeze.

01:17:05.002 --> 01:17:10.030
Someone please explain to me
what is going on.

01:17:11.309 --> 01:17:14.176
I think I can do that.

01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:16.336
See, this guy over here...

01:17:16.781 --> 01:17:19.443
...that man who thinks he's Chinese...
You're not.

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:24.380
- And his mother are criminals dealing
in pirated music, movies...

01:17:24.588 --> 01:17:28.251
...and probably Gucci handbags.
I don't know.

01:17:28.659 --> 01:17:30.786
- Probably.
- The guy with the eyebrows.

01:17:30.962 --> 01:17:36.025
- We know him. He drove us over here.
- He didn't tell us he was in the play.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.668
A cop and an actor.

01:17:38.836 --> 01:17:41.737
And how, may I ask, did you two
get involved in this?

01:17:41.906 --> 01:17:45.467
- I think I can shed some light on that.
- You see...

01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:51.081
...senator, it was this crime fighter here,
Officer Lomax...

01:17:51.248 --> 01:17:56.743
...who tracked down the Bang family
and wouldn't rest until justice was served.

01:17:56.921 --> 01:18:02.826
So really, we're just witnesses
to his sting operation.

01:18:03.127 --> 01:18:06.927
- Yeah! What she said.
- Is that true, Officer Lomax?

01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:09.895
Did you engineer this collar?

01:18:11.335 --> 01:18:15.169
Well, I don't want to gloat, senator,
but I think "mastermind"...

01:18:15.339 --> 01:18:18.536
...might be a more appropriate
choice of words.

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:19.971
I love you.

01:18:23.047 --> 01:18:24.878
Just a second.

01:18:25.049 --> 01:18:28.951
I assume that wasn't the speech
you intended to give this afternoon.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.782
- Not exactly, but...
- No. No. It wasn't.

01:18:31.956 --> 01:18:34.584
But you should have heard the real one.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:39.252
It was amazing, and I know this, because
I heard her practice it 1000 times.

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:42.399
And trust me, she would have won
this thing hands down.

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:46.234
I'm sorry today didn't work out
the way you planned.

01:18:46.771 --> 01:18:53.040
See, I thought today was about the speech,
the fellowship...

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.576
...my academic future.

01:18:56.347 --> 01:19:00.875
But instead, it was about something
much more important.

01:19:02.186 --> 01:19:06.748
It just took me a few wrong turns
to see it.

01:19:12.997 --> 01:19:17.024
- That was something else, wasn't it?
- Honey, I loved it. I loved it!

01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:19.897
Yes. You gotta... Come on.

01:19:20.071 --> 01:19:23.234
Gotta give it up for the Cats!

01:19:24.708 --> 01:19:26.642
Who let the cats out?

01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:28.711
Get your hands where I can see them.

01:19:28.879 --> 01:19:31.541
- Who let the cats out?
- You're not even a real cop.

01:19:31.715 --> 01:19:33.307
Zip it, Odd Job.

01:19:33.484 --> 01:19:36.214
Thanks to you, that's all gonna change.

01:19:40.858 --> 01:19:42.120
Let me do it.

01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:49.824
- So you're not mad?
- Are you kidding?

01:19:50.935 --> 01:19:53.426
I can't believe what you did for me today.

01:19:53.604 --> 01:19:56.164
- Listen...
- I want to apologize...

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.104
...for saying the things I said earlier.
It's just...

01:19:59.276 --> 01:20:02.268
...I was having a meltdown.
Everything was going wrong.

01:20:02.513 --> 01:20:05.641
That's because every time I tried to fix it,
it got worse.

01:20:05.816 --> 01:20:07.750
The point is...

01:20:08.719 --> 01:20:13.247
...we haven't spent the day together
in a really long time...

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:16.418
...and I've really missed you.

01:20:18.095 --> 01:20:20.154
I've missed you too.

01:20:21.765 --> 01:20:25.792
And I'm so, so sorry
if I ever made you feel...

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:29.531
...like you had to take Mom's place.

01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.803
She would have been really proud.

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:35.335
Both of us.

01:20:53.998 --> 01:20:56.466
It was really great bumping
into you today.

01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:59.769
Maybe we could bump again.

01:21:01.438 --> 01:21:04.066
Did I just say that?

01:21:04.275 --> 01:21:05.503
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:05.676 --> 01:21:07.371
And I'm glad you did.

01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:12.578
- So how about you just give me a call?
- Okay.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.547
Yeah.

01:21:15.686 --> 01:21:17.551
Jane Ryan?

01:21:19.356 --> 01:21:20.948
Bye.

01:21:21.492 --> 01:21:22.720
Bye.

01:21:22.893 --> 01:21:26.659
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Hudson McGill.

01:21:28.132 --> 01:21:31.499
Listen, I am so sorry about everything
that happened today...

01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:32.897
You know what?

01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:36.801
I think you handled yourself really well
today, considering everything.

01:21:37.775 --> 01:21:40.403
The McGill Foundation
would be really honored...

01:21:40.578 --> 01:21:44.708
...if you would represent us
at Oxford University next year.

01:21:46.517 --> 01:21:48.041
But...

01:21:48.219 --> 01:21:51.416
- I don't understand.
- I found these.

01:21:51.922 --> 01:21:55.119
This would have been an amazing speech.

01:21:55.593 --> 01:21:57.925
It's not just that you wanted to win...

01:21:58.095 --> 01:22:01.622
...it's that you absolutely refused to fail.

01:22:01.799 --> 01:22:03.630
And you didn't.

01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:07.828
You deserve this fellowship, Jane.
You really do.

01:22:08.005 --> 01:22:12.567
- Congratulations and good luck.
- Thank you.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:20.739
- Can you believe it?
- I'm so happy.

01:22:22.486 --> 01:22:24.147
I don't...

01:22:24.688 --> 01:22:28.419
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:22:31.662 --> 01:22:34.859
One, two, three, four!

01:23:06.397 --> 01:23:08.331
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:23:08.899 --> 01:23:11.868
So have you given any thought
to visiting me in London?

01:23:12.202 --> 01:23:15.171
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not gonna
be able to visit you.

01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:18.866
It's not gonna work out for me. Sorry.

01:23:19.043 --> 01:23:22.604
It's okay. I mean, your whole life's here.
I get it.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:28.047
Jane, I'm playing. I'm moving. I'm actually
transferring schools there next year.

01:23:28.218 --> 01:23:30.686
Really? Seriously?

01:23:30.854 --> 01:23:32.515
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

01:23:36.727 --> 01:23:38.786
I've got this great idea for the video.

01:23:38.962 --> 01:23:41.897
It's, like, Roxy, and she's dressed
as a cucumber, and...

01:23:42.566 --> 01:23:47.230
Well, maybe I should just be happy that I'm
going to London on tour with you guys...

01:23:47.404 --> 01:23:50.430
...and keep these thoughts to myself.
- Agreed.

01:23:55.713 --> 01:23:57.874
Open up! Police!

01:23:58.048 --> 01:23:59.777
Cut it, guys. Cut it.

01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:18.229
Sorry to break up the party here, kids.

01:24:18.769 --> 01:24:23.797
But you see, I got this little VW Bug
parked out there in a loading zone.

01:24:24.208 --> 01:24:29.475
License number 2 Quilted Laxative 4
Santa Kansas Limerick.

01:24:31.081 --> 01:24:33.311
Where's Roxanne Ryan?

01:24:33.484 --> 01:24:35.281
You've got to be kidding me.

01:24:36.487 --> 01:24:37.977
I am.

01:24:38.522 --> 01:24:42.356
I just stopped by to wish you
bon voyage...

01:24:42.526 --> 01:24:44.653
...and maybe get an autograph.

01:24:45.295 --> 01:24:48.355
Of course you may, Officer Lomax.

01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:53.998
Thank you, ma'am.

01:24:59.309 --> 01:25:04.679
Hey, lggy Pop, crank the juice on that half
stack, and let's hear what this band can do!

01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:07.112
You heard him. Let's roll the guitars.

01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:09.785
Nice work, son.
