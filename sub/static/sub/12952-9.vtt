00:00.760 --> 00:03.070
Ms. Bristow, we know you know 
how to read this code.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.000
Decipher the text and we won't have to.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.570
Don't bother negotiating with me !

00:10.000 --> 00:16.074

00:20.880 --> 00:21.720
- Sydney !
- Dad !

00:21.820 --> 00:23.220
You're all right, sweetie.
You're all right.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.830
He's with us. Get in.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.160
You made it, Sydney.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.230
You made it.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.950
But at the very least we'd be able to get 
to Sydney's coordinates.

01:31.020 --> 01:35.860
Okay, according to the geo-synchronous orbital position, our entrance is here and here.

01:36.020 --> 01:37.990
We've gotta secure these ones.

01:43.970 --> 01:44.990
Sweetheart,

01:45.300 --> 01:46.340
you're okay ?

01:57.480 --> 01:58.180
How do you feel ?

02:00.650 --> 02:02.220
Better. Thanks.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.620
What's going on ?

02:06.700 --> 02:07.220
You should know

02:07.220 --> 02:10.160
Sloane was instrumental 
in orchestrating your escape.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.190
I suppose I owe you a thank you.

02:12.390 --> 02:15.260
Sydney, as long as you're alive 
you'll never owe me a thing.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.830
Not just you.

02:19.130 --> 02:22.940
Breaking me out of that facility 
was dangerous and selfless.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.610
Thank you.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.840
All of you.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.950
At the moment we're fugitives

02:33.050 --> 02:35.750
but we're working on a plan to frame 
the Covenant for your extraction.

02:35.850 --> 02:38.650
Have you mapped the coordinates from the code that Lindsey found in Rome ?

02:38.750 --> 02:40.960
They point to a strip of desert 
near the San Andreas fault

02:41.090 --> 02:43.030
less than an hour from here.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.260
If there's something waiting for us, 
it's most likely buried.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.830
I'm going to go check it out. 
In the meantime, we have a lead.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.840
Something that might actually help us retrieve your lost memories.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.840
Sydney, my foundation gives grants 
to various researchers.

02:57.340 --> 03:04.410
One of these men has in development 
a non-invasive therapy for treating 
long-term severe amnesia.

03:04.510 --> 03:07.480
If this therapy works, 
why didn't you mention it before ?

03:07.820 --> 03:10.120
Well, Sydney, until now

03:10.450 --> 03:13.060
I didn't think that you'd be willing 
to accept my help.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.660
Dad, I wanna go with you.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.960
- You should rest.
- I've rested enough.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.970
So, I was an idiot.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.990
Michael tried to warn me about Lindsey, but...

03:32.070 --> 03:33.580
I didn't listen.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.380
I couldn't believe what he was telling me so...

03:36.710 --> 03:38.650
so I did what I always do :

03:38.780 --> 03:40.320
I followed the rules.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.580
We should go.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.620
You said on the helicopter

03:48.720 --> 03:51.530
when Lindsey forced you to break the code, 
you gave him false coordinates.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.730
Where did you send them ?

03:53.630 --> 03:55.160
I don't know.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.370
I think somewhere in Simi Valley.

04:11.180 --> 04:14.520
Sir, we've checked the location.
It's clean. It's a liquor store.

04:14.620 --> 04:15.680
I want you to check it again.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.550
- I think we've been played.
- Don't tell me we've been played. 
Check it again !

04:42.450 --> 04:44.680
What if whatever we're looking for isn't metal ?

04:44.780 --> 04:45.810
Then we're screwed.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.950
Not an unfamiliar situation.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.450
Listen Sydney,

04:49.790 --> 04:53.020
while I remain skeptical 
of Sloane's alleged rehabilitation,

04:53.090 --> 04:55.860
the man jumped in front of a bullet 
to save my life.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.890
I've been through too much with him. 
I don't trust that man

04:59.390 --> 05:01.360
and I still can't believe you don't feel the same.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.000
What I'm feeling is irrelevant.

05:03.530 --> 05:05.900
In conspiring to save you from the NSC,

05:06.840 --> 05:10.940
Sloane's also given us all the ammunition we'd ever need to invalidate his pardon agreement.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.310
He's put his life in our hands.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.810
And as far as breaking you out,

05:16.410 --> 05:19.580
yours was in his.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.900
Nice catch, Steven !

05:33.060 --> 05:34.030
Hey, Robin !

05:39.030 --> 05:41.570
Sweetie, come here. 
Steven, come here !

05:47.110 --> 05:48.780
Special Agent Reams, FBI.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.680
You're under arrest on suspicion of conspiracy 
to impede a federal investigation.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.880
- This is Lindsey, isn't it ?
- Your children will be looked after through the duration...

05:53.980 --> 05:57.190
- He ordered this ?
- ...of your custody unless you find a suitable family member.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.950
You're gonna have to come with us.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.460
- Is this familiar to you ?
- No.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.420
I don't know if I buried it myself

06:31.520 --> 06:33.260
or if it was left for me to find.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.190
And that symbol ?

06:34.760 --> 06:37.960
It symbolizes his membership 
in the Magnific Order of Rambaldi.

06:38.190 --> 06:42.360
Whoever that person was, he made a vow 
to safeguard Rambaldi's prophecies.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.170
When you get back, you'll ask Marshall 
to run a DNA test.

06:45.200 --> 06:45.790
Right.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.000
What's your alibi ?

06:47.240 --> 06:52.170
I'll return to Lindsey, tell him I was abducted 
by the Covenant, and that you're still being held hostage.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.890
And what are we saying they want ?

06:53.990 --> 06:55.310
How about the Rambaldi device ?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.710
You'd like that, wouldn't you ?

06:57.810 --> 07:00.250
Sydney, I know what you're thinking. 
Why don't you ask yourself,

07:00.350 --> 07:03.090
if the device was so valuable to me, 
why did I let it go ?

07:03.150 --> 07:04.250
For your freedom.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.920
You traded it for your pardon, 
and here's your chance to get it back.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.290
It is something the CIA might believe the Covenant would take in exchange for you.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.560
And once we make the exchange, 
the device will be destroyed.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.070
No one will have it.

07:17.370 --> 07:23.540
I'll contact Bob Lindsey and tell him that 
my sources have confirmed that the Covenant 
is responsible for your break-out.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.640
As soon as I hear from Dr. Brezel, 
I'll let you know.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.880
He's the neuroresearcher who works out of Yale.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.850
What about you ?

07:31.150 --> 07:33.780
We're saying that your father and I 
were investigating your disappearance.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.920
We're setting up a paper trail, 
rent-a-cars, airline tickets...

07:36.020 --> 07:37.620
There's something else that just occurred to me.

07:38.190 --> 07:40.520
If Lindsey's to believe I was being held 
by the Covenant,

07:40.620 --> 07:42.590
there needs to be some evidence 
of my mistreatment.

07:43.390 --> 07:43.930
No.

07:44.030 --> 07:44.960
She's right.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.930
I was going to bring that up myself 
at the last possible moment.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.330
I am not going to let you be beaten.

07:49.430 --> 07:51.370
I'm the only one who's NSC, 
the only one Lindsey will listen to.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.270
If I don't go back, 
he's gonna think I'm a part of, too.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.340
Jack, this is insane !

07:54.470 --> 07:56.000
Vaughn, this whole situation is a problem.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.940
We need physical evidence to help sell the idea that the Covenant was responsible.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.110
You should do it.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.420
Whenever you're ready.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.420
Just get it over with.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.430
I know how difficult this must be...

08:27.640 --> 08:29.540
That was for turning me in to Lindsey.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.770
This is for helping me break out.

08:34.309 --> 08:35.380
Now let's get this over with.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.590
Where's Sydney Bristow ?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.260
You covered for her once and it cost you your job.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.700
Do it again,

08:56.900 --> 08:59.600
this cell will be your home for the next ten years.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.240
My lawyer's name is Shelley Byrd.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.740
Your only play here is to tell me 
where Sydney Bristow is

09:05.810 --> 09:07.210
and who broke her out.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.780
Was it her father ?

09:10.650 --> 09:12.050
What I know here,

09:12.450 --> 09:15.080
is that sending agents to arrest me 
in front of my children

09:15.180 --> 09:19.020
one of the last mistakes you'll ever make 
as Senior Director of the NSC.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.290
I've known men like you,

09:24.490 --> 09:27.360
men who pretend to be patriots.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.030
You are always revealed.

09:32.730 --> 09:33.600
What ?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.910
Sir, it's Lauren Reed. She's here.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.900
She was thrown from the van in front of the building. They just drove by and dumped her.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.620
- When ?
- Less than five minutes ago.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.820
She refused medical services.
Said she needed to speak with you.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.230
And that was the Covenant's only demand ?

10:00.360 --> 10:01.300
Yes.

10:01.930 --> 10:05.100
"Your people want Sydney Bristow. 
We want the Rambaldi device".

10:05.170 --> 10:06.540
That's what the man said.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.370
The voice ?

10:09.100 --> 10:10.040
Yes.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.880
You don't find the timing curious ?

10:13.980 --> 10:17.480
That Sydney Bristow was taken 
from a black-ops U.S. facility,

10:17.580 --> 10:19.080
that somehow they took you as well.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.620
That you've since been released

10:20.750 --> 10:24.520
And meanwhile, your husband 
and Sydney Bristow's father

10:25.220 --> 10:27.660
are MIA searching for a Covenant cell.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.590
Curious ? No.

10:31.230 --> 10:35.230
Logical, appropriate. 
Lucky as hell for me ? Yes.

10:35.660 --> 10:38.870
I don't know why the Covenant is willing to make this exchange or what it means.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.700
But Sydney is depending on you 
making this happen.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.340
Since when did you and Bristow 
become so close ?

10:45.510 --> 10:47.280
Or is that about sharing the same man ?

10:48.780 --> 10:50.480
This is a woman's life.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.720
Protect it or I will report everything you've done 
to your superiors.

10:57.750 --> 11:02.160
Need I remind you that it was your husband who helped her flee the country when she was wanted by the NSC ?

11:02.260 --> 11:04.560
In the wrong hands that information 
can be quite damaging.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.930
One more thing :

11:11.330 --> 11:13.840
At 6:30 this evening, you are to press redial.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.810
The person who answers it will give you 
the details of the exchange.

11:17.910 --> 11:18.470
Hello ?

11:18.540 --> 11:21.540
The Rambaldi device in exchange 
for Sydney Bristow.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.950
- Do we have a deal ?
- Yes.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.420
Keep this phone with you at all times.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.620
You will be notified as to time and place.

11:40.260 --> 11:41.600
Lauren did well.

11:54.110 --> 11:57.110
I never thanked you for helping to extract Sydney.

11:57.410 --> 11:58.650
You don't have to thank me.

11:58.750 --> 11:59.750
Yes, I do.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.920
Especially given your history.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.720
I used to think you didn't have much of a spine.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.890
And has that assessment changed at all ?

12:10.990 --> 12:11.690
No.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.230
Dr. Brezel's expecting us.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.830
This is where he works ?

12:52.070 --> 12:54.970
Wow ! Say something else.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.870
May we come in ?

12:59.510 --> 13:00.680
Professor !

13:04.080 --> 13:06.350
There are some beautiful people here.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.420
I was thinking just now.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.660
I wasn't expecting you until Tuesday, and...

13:18.660 --> 13:21.830
And then I realized that it is, it's Tuesday, and...

13:24.170 --> 13:27.100
you've come to me at a really awkward time.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.370
I'm not nearly finished so

13:29.540 --> 13:31.740
I can't promise you anything.

13:32.170 --> 13:36.380
Still, your research in memory retrieval 
sounds quite promising.

13:36.550 --> 13:39.180
Oh, yeah, well that's, that's really a trip.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.350
Oh, can I... do you mind if I...

13:45.190 --> 13:47.060
Oh, she, she likes to hug, if you...

13:48.460 --> 13:49.760
This is Kaya.

13:49.990 --> 13:51.690
She's one of my students.

13:51.930 --> 13:58.430
Capable, but she's.. all about hugging. 
All about hugging.

13:59.370 --> 14:02.400
You know, I'm starving. Anyone else ?

14:05.880 --> 14:08.010
Okay, you have got to be kidding me ?

14:08.110 --> 14:08.880
I can't do this.

14:08.940 --> 14:11.480
Look, we're not here 
because we have other options.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.430
Facon ?

14:22.430 --> 14:23.460
Oh, no thanks.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.230
I'm fine.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.630
Facon...

14:30.530 --> 14:34.270
Processed soy protein shaped 
and colored to resemble

14:34.270 --> 14:37.300
the essence of smoked pig flesh.

14:37.870 --> 14:41.240
We live in an age of simulations.

14:41.740 --> 14:46.280
But facon is only one of the many illusions 
of the post-modern world.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.120
I don't know anything about you

14:48.620 --> 14:51.590
except that I'm not supposed to know 
anything about you.

14:54.860 --> 14:59.930
Suffice to say that there are people who are under the impression that my daughter 
has committed a crime.

15:00.230 --> 15:03.000
Her memories are the only things 
that can exonerate her.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.200
I see so...

15:05.370 --> 15:06.270
there's pressure...

15:06.270 --> 15:09.170
pressure that the therapy should work...

15:09.870 --> 15:10.740
Real stakes.

15:10.870 --> 15:13.040
How does the therapy work ?

15:13.140 --> 15:14.640
Tell them how you got the idea.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.110
But not the long version.

15:17.810 --> 15:20.380
I began in the neurosciences,

15:20.480 --> 15:22.050
background in philosophy.

15:22.150 --> 15:24.990
Treated head trauma patients for twelve years

15:25.090 --> 15:28.260
until one night on I-95,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.330
I became one of them...

15:30.490 --> 15:32.530
a head trauma patient.

15:32.690 --> 15:36.200
I drove into the highway median, 
totaled my pickup truck.

15:36.300 --> 15:40.870
So I spent the next eighteen months 
in various forms of traction.

15:41.170 --> 15:46.680
Now, that's not the torture you'd expect, 
not moving for a year and a half.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.550
It's liberating, oddly.

15:50.350 --> 15:57.320
Well in any event, one night, month eleven 
of my motionlessness,

15:57.690 --> 16:00.490
something obvious occurred to me.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.030
Our dreams are both

16:03.130 --> 16:07.230
a priori and a posteriori.

16:07.430 --> 16:10.470
Which means that our dreams 
contain our memories,

16:10.570 --> 16:13.470
which means there's a shared reservoir.

16:13.570 --> 16:17.270
So, I began to consider ways

16:17.370 --> 16:20.680
to consciously enter the subconscious.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.550
Ways to convince the brain 
that it was truly experiencing

16:26.880 --> 16:29.280
the dream/memory state.

16:29.420 --> 16:34.090
So, I turned to the one thing that I really knew :

16:34.560 --> 16:35.760
Drugs.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.890
Ergo I totaled my pickup truck.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.160
What are the drugs ?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.500
Oh, well, the cocktails,

16:44.640 --> 16:48.500
the happy combo of synthetics and organics.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.140
I mean, it won't kill you.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.740
But depending on what they are, 
your dreams just might.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.480
I say we get this party started.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.080
Kaya will show you were to change.

17:05.619 --> 17:06.819
Come with me.

17:16.099 --> 17:20.500
When most people are asleep, they don't realize they're dreaming until they're awake.

17:20.599 --> 17:26.339
But you, you're going to have to become lucid 
in the dream state itself.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.780
How do I do that ?

17:28.109 --> 17:31.280
Well, the drugs I'm gonna give you 
will do most of the work.

17:31.410 --> 17:34.050
But I will be monitoring your neural activity,

17:34.320 --> 17:36.620
and when I know you're in REM,

17:36.690 --> 17:39.690
I'll give you a verbal cue over the headphones.

17:39.820 --> 17:44.790
Tell me, what was the last thing you remember, before your missing time ?

17:45.220 --> 17:48.030
Being knocked unconscious in my apartment.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.400
Well, I see.

17:52.370 --> 17:57.040
Well, once you're aware 
that you're in the dream state,

17:57.240 --> 18:03.480
your objective will be to pick up the thread of your last memory in as much detail as you can.

18:04.950 --> 18:05.950
How ?

18:06.850 --> 18:10.590
Well, you'll have to, you're just going to have to feel your way back.

18:10.950 --> 18:16.930
It's like, it's like using a muscle that you never used before.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.430
If you can get to that point,

18:19.700 --> 18:27.670
just stay with it because, ultimately, you will become aware of what happened next.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.640
I don't really understand.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.470
I know. You will.

18:32.740 --> 18:39.250
Just be aware that if you encounter a new memory, it might be traumatic.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.820
But it won't necessarily be real ?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.490
Oh, it will be to you !

18:43.620 --> 18:46.190
Here are your headphones, I'm putting them 
on you now. And...

18:46.960 --> 18:47.590
good luck.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.060
Sydney, I'm going to count down from ten.

19:24.230 --> 19:28.330
By the time I reach one, you will be asleep.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.460
- Vaughn !
- Yeah, it's me.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.660
Don't move, you've suffered 
a severe head trauma.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.430
What ?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.090
Any nausea or dizziness ?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.530
No ! Where am I ?

19:59.630 --> 20:00.900
On your way to the hospital.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.230
You have a mild concussion. You'll be okay.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.130
We'll run a CT scan to check for bleeding.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.470
- Will's going to be okay.
- Will ?

20:06.640 --> 20:09.070
He lost a lot of blood, but we got him in time. He's on his way to Cedars.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.540
Will's in witness protection.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.740
This is normal, gaps in memory leading up 
to the injury.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.080
Sydney, the woman you were living with 
was not Francie.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.480
We found a file that Will was compiling. 
Her name was Allison Dorin. You shot her.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.820
I know. She was the second double, 
the one we never found.

20:20.950 --> 20:21.650
It's coming back to you.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.620
- Miss, you need to lay down.
- Wait !

20:23.790 --> 20:24.320
Wait !

20:24.420 --> 20:26.820
The Covenant... 
Have you ever heard of the Covenant ?

20:26.920 --> 20:30.090
Yeah, they were listed on a sitreport yesterday as an emerging threat. 
Why ? Are they involved in this ?

20:30.190 --> 20:33.260
Sloane... Has Sloane been pardoned 
by the State Department ?

20:33.430 --> 20:34.360
Pardoned ?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.430
You're not wearing a wedding ring.

20:39.870 --> 20:43.170
No, I thought we'd go to Santa Barbara first 
and see how that went.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.680
You're not married ?

20:49.610 --> 20:51.610
You really did hit your head, huh ?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.750
I thought you gave up on us.

20:56.490 --> 21:00.020
Syd, when I walked into your apartment, 
I saw you lying there,

21:00.190 --> 21:04.630
I thought : "God, don't let me miss a chance 
to tell her how much I love her."

21:04.760 --> 21:06.200
I love you !

21:12.030 --> 21:13.100
Sydney !

21:13.700 --> 21:14.440
Get away from me !

21:14.570 --> 21:15.500
Sydney, you're dreaming !

21:16.210 --> 21:19.710
If you can hear me, then you're in a dream state.

21:19.910 --> 21:23.880
You need to use it to get back to where you were,

21:24.010 --> 21:26.280
to get to the last memory you have.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.420
Now remember, you said it was 
in your apartment,

21:30.520 --> 21:31.820
that you were knocked out.

21:31.950 --> 21:35.160
You must try to go back to that place.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.690
you must try to find that place.

21:37.790 --> 21:38.690
Sydney,

21:39.190 --> 21:41.700
you are in control of your environment.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.470
Go now.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.100
She's out of REM.

22:49.230 --> 22:52.000
And she exists now in actual memory.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.000
She was knocked unconscious after the fight.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.440
How can she remember anything 
that happened after that ?

22:56.570 --> 23:02.280
Because, unconsciously, the mind can still establish trans-historical accounts

23:02.440 --> 23:03.680
of the real world.

23:03.780 --> 23:04.950
Meaning even with her eyes closed,

23:05.050 --> 23:06.180
her other senses were alert.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.120
Yes. Thank you.

23:08.320 --> 23:16.530
And based on those senses, her brain will construct an accurate but incomplete memory

23:16.630 --> 23:18.530
of the events that followed.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.060
The barbecue chips ? Please,

23:21.100 --> 23:23.600
could you pass me those ? Thank you.

23:56.470 --> 23:59.030
I see them. They're taking me away.

23:59.170 --> 24:00.770
- But...
- Who, Sydney ?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.340
I can't see their faces.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.940
What did she say ?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.870
Uh, someone without a face.

24:05.910 --> 24:07.740
It's not that uncommon.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.250
Don't !

25:27.760 --> 25:29.760
Happy birthday !

25:33.900 --> 25:35.900
Happy birthday, Sydney !

25:41.370 --> 25:43.710
She's extrapolating.

25:43.840 --> 25:44.740
Meaning what ?

25:44.970 --> 25:47.340
Brain activity indicates

25:47.440 --> 25:49.410
her memory centers aren't active.

25:49.450 --> 25:50.850
She's in a tangent.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.050
I was in a tangent once.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.290
How nice for you.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.520
Happy birthday, honey !

26:01.960 --> 26:03.660
Make a wish, Sydney.

26:19.710 --> 26:21.240
Time to cut the cake.

26:24.080 --> 26:24.980
It's all right.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.600
Sydney ! Sydney !

26:45.700 --> 26:47.200
Sydney, listen to me.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.900
You have to concentrate.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.310
It's the only way you're going to get back on track.

26:51.470 --> 26:52.510
I don't know how.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.110
Focus on the last detail you remember.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.120
There I am.

27:05.450 --> 27:06.720
Excuse me, dad,

27:06.920 --> 27:07.960
I have to go.

28:25.430 --> 28:26.700
Sydney !

28:56.330 --> 28:59.400
This is very, very unusual. Very unusual.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.500
What ?

29:02.370 --> 29:05.010
Well, she's still in beta, but she's dreaming.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.980
That just doesn't happen.

29:26.730 --> 29:27.900
Sydney !

29:30.500 --> 29:31.970
You knew better...

29:32.100 --> 29:33.240
You were part of this !

29:57.490 --> 29:58.790
Kill the power feed !

29:58.990 --> 30:00.060
What the hell is happening ?

30:00.230 --> 30:01.430
She's in v-tach.

30:01.530 --> 30:04.430
Get the epinephrine, it's on the tray. 
Get these off her.

30:06.030 --> 30:07.740
She's flatlining.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.100
We need to resuscitate her now !

30:09.770 --> 30:11.310
Get the defibrillator paddles.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.410
200 joules, charging.

30:15.610 --> 30:16.550
Clear !

30:17.880 --> 30:19.350
300 joules !

30:19.520 --> 30:20.250
Sydney, wake up.

30:20.350 --> 30:21.150
Clear !

30:41.900 --> 30:44.770
Vaughn... Help me up.

30:57.690 --> 30:58.050
Syd...

31:00.320 --> 31:02.860
I can't help it, I just miss you.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.490
I do.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.730
You know we can't do this.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.630
Give me a break !

31:12.570 --> 31:14.800
It's a dream, we can do whatever we want.

31:15.370 --> 31:16.440
At least I can.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.780
Your vitals are normal, you're gonna be fine.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.510
I assume he just told you.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.160
God ! I...

31:34.490 --> 31:35.190
It's okay.

31:42.830 --> 31:45.030
Mrs. Vaughn ! Lauren ! Mrs. Reed !

31:49.000 --> 31:50.910
I had too many jelly doughnuts !

31:51.440 --> 31:52.510
Are those the DNA results ?

31:53.140 --> 31:54.140
Not exactly.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.610
I checked the sample against all available databanks

31:56.710 --> 31:58.150
and I wasn't really able to find a match.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.850
But I did run some other forensic tests and, well,

32:01.180 --> 32:02.480
I hope this helps.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.220
Yes, I understand.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.030
That was Lauren.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.930
No match on the DNA.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.100
We still don't know who the hand belongs to.

32:16.730 --> 32:19.670
In my dream, it was my birthday. I was seven.

32:20.070 --> 32:24.970
When I cut the cake, I looked down 
and I was cutting off his hand.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.680
Whose hand ? Did you see his face ?

32:27.140 --> 32:27.780
Yes, I did.

32:28.540 --> 32:29.310
Who was it ?

32:31.210 --> 32:32.150
Lazarey.

32:34.550 --> 32:37.620
Why would I dream I was cutting off the hand 
of a man I murdered ?

32:37.720 --> 32:45.030
Forensics analysis leads Marshall to believe 
that whoever this hand belonged to was alive 
as recently as four months ago.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.870
Well, then it couldn't have been Lazarey 
because I killed him last year.

32:49.970 --> 32:50.870
Unless you didn't.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.370
What ? I was on the videotape. It was me.

32:53.470 --> 32:54.700
I slashed his throat.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.770
Unless you didn't. 
It could have been a performance.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.710
Lazarey was a Russian diplomat.

33:01.810 --> 33:04.480
The Russians must have typed his DNA.

33:04.610 --> 33:07.850
Lauren's worked with them. I'll call her, 
have her get a sample, see if it's a match.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.160
You know, this really was something.

33:13.590 --> 33:17.430
whatever you experienced 
elevated your heart rate to the point of

33:17.930 --> 33:20.400
ventricular tachycardia,

33:20.530 --> 33:22.630
which sent you into cardiac arrest

33:22.760 --> 33:25.930
which almost sent me into cardiac arrest...

33:26.070 --> 33:27.100
are you okay ?

33:27.270 --> 33:27.970
Yeah.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.040
I feel great, actually.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.170
What other details do you remember ?

33:32.710 --> 33:36.040
After my fight with Allison, these men 
came into the room.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.710
I couldn't see their faces.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.520
They were wearing black.

33:40.420 --> 33:43.420
They took me to a building. I was on a gurney.

33:44.590 --> 33:48.860
They wheeled me through the door, and

33:48.960 --> 33:51.260
I lost them before I could see 
where they took me next.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.200
Lauren strangled me.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.800
Well, that was a dream.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.540
It must have been a dream, right ?

34:06.680 --> 34:10.179
It's unclear, you know. 
This is not an exact science.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.810
At that point in your life, 
you had never even met Lauren.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.889
You know, this would probably be 
a representational figure

34:19.090 --> 34:21.120
which is also not than uncommon by the way.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.560
Masked figures, shapeshifters.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.929
They first appear as one character :

34:27.300 --> 34:29.699
your mother, an old classmate.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.530
In my case, a parrot.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.540
A parrot.

34:34.340 --> 34:38.040
But they're really just physical manifestations 
of someone else.

34:38.139 --> 34:39.639
I wanna go back.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.840
Sydney, that's a mistake.

34:42.679 --> 34:46.110
They were taking me towards a room. 
It was room 47.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.520
That's where I was, that's where I was being held.

34:50.550 --> 34:53.120
I have to go back and see 
what was happening to me in there.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.330
You're the greatest !

35:02.400 --> 35:04.030
Once you're under,

35:04.170 --> 35:07.200
you'll most likely begin in a dream cycle.

35:07.970 --> 35:10.310
Again, no matter where you are,

35:10.310 --> 35:14.540
try to pick up the thread of your last memory 
by focusing on a detail

35:14.640 --> 35:17.750
you remember, something vivid.

35:18.150 --> 35:21.120
There was hanging plastic in the building 
where I was taken.

35:21.380 --> 35:24.420
Whatever it is, you're looking for a link,

35:24.790 --> 35:30.690
portal, back to your memory state, 
back to the door you described.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.560
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.730
Okay.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.870
Here are the headphones. 
I'm going to put them on you.

35:42.270 --> 35:42.940
Good luck.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.090
When I received the call for this meeting,

36:07.060 --> 36:09.770
I assumed it would be with a low-level agent.

36:10.430 --> 36:12.630
Do you have confirmation 
of the Covenant's demands ?

36:13.140 --> 36:15.670
My sources have confirmed they are holding Sydney Bristow.

36:16.710 --> 36:20.640
They're asking for the Rambaldi device 
in exchange for her release.

36:22.210 --> 36:23.810
This is an awkward conversation.

36:23.910 --> 36:24.880
How so ?

36:26.220 --> 36:27.880
Because of what I'm asking of you.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.250
To use your contacts.

36:31.350 --> 36:32.750
Why come to me ?

36:33.160 --> 36:35.490
Because you can give me untraceability.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.230
I'm looking for someone trained in wetwork...

36:38.790 --> 36:41.960
In particular, dead shot with a long-range rifle.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.500
I plan on making the trade

36:45.530 --> 36:49.100
During the exchange, I want Sydney Bristow taken out.

36:51.900 --> 36:54.080
Why make the trade ?

36:55.940 --> 36:58.710
It's very simple, have the Covenant end her life.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.950
Because I want assurance

37:02.050 --> 37:04.320
that Sydney Bristow is eliminated.

37:06.520 --> 37:07.690
I see.

37:08.590 --> 37:10.990
She has something on you, does she ?

37:13.130 --> 37:16.100
If she's hit by a sniper,

37:16.530 --> 37:19.130
it will appear as though it's a Covenant double-cross.

37:19.970 --> 37:23.140
Well, with all due respect Mr. Director,

37:23.870 --> 37:27.080
what guarantee do I have 
that this isn't some form of entrapment ?

37:31.910 --> 37:34.320
Because I know what you're up to, Mr. Sloane.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.920
I can see your big picture.

37:37.290 --> 37:39.290
I know your endgame.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.360
I even have proof.

37:56.710 --> 37:58.540
Once I arrange the trade,

37:58.670 --> 38:00.610
I'll call you with the details.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.060
The DNA you've got from the Kremlin...

38:14.520 --> 38:15.560
I matched it.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.760
The hand belongs to Lazarey ?

38:16.860 --> 38:17.590
Yeah.

38:17.930 --> 38:20.900
I mean, it belonged to Lazarey before that...

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
- Thank you.
- Sure.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.670
You're sure the DNA matched Lazarey ?

38:26.770 --> 38:28.700
Yes, which means Sydney didn't kill him.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.810
Lindsey has nothing on her.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.010
She can come home.

38:32.170 --> 38:33.140
Thank you.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.160
You still asleep ?

38:55.460 --> 38:56.470
I think so.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.970
I've never heard of a St. Aidan.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.110
They're hard to find.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.390
Don't forget the case.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.740
Syd ! You made it !

39:34.000 --> 39:36.910
Hope you're ready for an expensive lesson 
in the art of gambling.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.040
I'm looking for that building.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.240
Check the kitchen.

39:42.610 --> 39:43.380
Kitchen.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.780
Thanks.

39:58.480 --> 40:02.480
Okay. She's in.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.600
Is she alright ?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.900
She's alpha, her serotonin levels 
are still increasing,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.670
and, see, her heart rate's up.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.480
She's on track for another vivid one.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.250
You shouldn't have come back.

40:25.390 --> 40:26.320
Who are you ?

40:26.690 --> 40:27.620
Who the hell are you ?

40:27.690 --> 40:29.560
I'm telling you, you don't want to be here.

40:29.890 --> 40:31.490
You're not Lauren.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.060
I know you're not Lauren.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.330
It doesn't matter who I am.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.330
All that matters is that you leave this place.

40:36.430 --> 40:38.630
You get the hell out of my way !

40:38.770 --> 40:40.040
I can't do that.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.440
You are so stubborn !

40:53.780 --> 40:55.550
You idiot ! We wanna stay away !

40:55.720 --> 40:58.520
We know the Covenant had us, we suspected it all along. Of course we're right !

40:58.620 --> 40:59.860
It was the Covenant !

41:00.790 --> 41:03.260
We think it's an accident we don't remember anything ?

41:03.590 --> 41:05.030
Then what happened to me ?

41:05.160 --> 41:06.330
Trust Lazarey !

41:07.500 --> 41:09.000
What does he have to do with it ?

41:09.100 --> 41:10.200
That's enough questions.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.970
What's in room 47 ?

41:12.730 --> 41:14.540
Pull her out, now ! 
I'm not going to risk her life again !

41:14.640 --> 41:18.240
No, her heart rate's alright, 
let's give her a chance.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.710
Oh my God !
