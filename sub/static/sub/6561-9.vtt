01:48.409 --> 01:52.813
[all speaking excitedly]

01:52.880 --> 01:54.014
- WE DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.183
WE WANT TO STAY HERE...

01:55.249 --> 01:56.350
- AND GET FAMOUS.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.186
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

01:58.252 --> 01:59.553
TOO BAD!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.589
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.056
THE DEMOS ARE DONE.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.592
THAT WAS THE "DEAL."

02:04.658 --> 02:06.860
- RIGHT...
WHAT ARE DEMOS AGAIN?

02:06.927 --> 02:08.696
- THEY'RE THE SAMPLE SONGS
WE'VE BEEN RECORDING

02:08.762 --> 02:10.063
THAT IF
THE RECORD COMPANY LIKES,

02:10.198 --> 02:12.766
THEN YOU GET TO STAY HERE,
MAKE A FULL ALBUM,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.702
GO ON TOUR,
AND THEN...

02:14.768 --> 02:16.870
* YOU BECOME FAMOUS *

02:16.937 --> 02:19.573
- BUT IF THEY DON'T PICK IT,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.975
I TAKE OVER
MY FATHER'S SCOOTER BUSINESS,

02:22.042 --> 02:25.979
AND YOU GO BACK TO MINNESOTA
AND BE NOBODIES AGAIN.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.215
- AH!

02:27.281 --> 02:28.982
- BUT WE'VE WORKED SO HARD.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.050
WE'RE SO CLOSE.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.352
- YOU'RE NOT SO CLOSE.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.355
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE?

02:34.422 --> 02:35.756
- HALFWAY THERE?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.658
- YOU'RE ALMOST HALFWAY THERE.

02:37.725 --> 02:41.662
NOW, I'M GOING TO GO
TO MY OFFICE.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.097
PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW ME.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.673
- HOW COULD GRIFFIN
NOT PICK BIG TIME RUSH?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.107
HE LOVES US.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.710
- GRIFFIN LOVES ALL THE BANDS
WITH DEMOS,

02:56.777 --> 02:58.379
AND THERE ARE SIX OF THEM,

02:58.446 --> 03:01.282
BUT ONLY ONE GETS PICKED.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.518
- AND THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY
IS TALKING ABOUT IS VAMPIRAH.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.886
- AH!

03:05.953 --> 03:08.055
- VAMPIRE DUDES WITH GUITARS.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.089
WE'RE TOAST.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.891
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
WE ARE NOT TOAST.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.260
WHAT'S THE ONE THING
WE'VE LEARNED

03:12.260 --> 03:13.294
SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN L.A.?

03:13.361 --> 03:14.595
- THAT BLACK IS THE NEW BLACK.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.164
- IF YOU DRINK COLD MILK
ON A HOT DAY, YOU DIE.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.632
- THAT EVERY TIME
YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.268
YOUR TOYS COME ALIVE.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.136
- THAT YOU DON'T WAIT
FOR YOUR DREAMS TO HAPPEN.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.505
YOU MAKE THEM HAPPEN.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.007
NOW, HOW DOES THE WINNING DEMO
GET PICKED?

03:27.074 --> 03:30.378
- THAT IS A HIGHLY CLASSIFIED
CORPORATE SECRET

03:30.444 --> 03:34.014
THAT NO ONE WILL TELL ME,
AND IT'S KILLING ME!

03:34.081 --> 03:37.017
- GUYS, WE WANT THIS
AS BADLY AS YOU DO,

03:37.084 --> 03:39.152
BUT ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
THE WINNING BAND IS PICKED

03:39.287 --> 03:41.088
BY A TOP-SECRET ADVISER
VERY CLOSE TO GRIFFIN.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.490
- [laughs]

03:42.556 --> 03:45.793
YEAH, EWW, I JUST ENTERED
THIS TOTALLY UGLY OFFICE.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.328
HOLD ON, I'M MINI BARFING.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.696
[coughs]

03:48.762 --> 03:51.565
I'M HERE TO PICK UP A CD
FROM BIG TIME...WHATEVER.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.302
- I'M SORRY,
WHO ARE YOU?

03:54.335 --> 03:57.104
- MERCEDES GRIFFIN,
AS IN YOUR BOSS' DAUGHTER.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.906
I'LL CALL YOU BACK, JESS.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.974
LIVIN' LARGE HERE
IS ABOUT TO START GROVELING.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.678

04:06.814 --> 04:09.950
HEY, UM, HERE IS THE DEMO.

04:10.017 --> 04:14.054
UM, CAN I--CAN I GET YOU
A LATTE OR A YACHT?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.661
- IS THIS THE BAND?

04:20.728 --> 04:22.062
YOU GUYS ARE HOT.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.997
- OH,
AND YOU'RE THE SECRET SOMEONE

04:24.064 --> 04:26.334
WHO'S CLOSE TO GRIFFIN
WHO DECIDES THE WINNING DEMOS.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.069
- THAT'S RIGHT,
I MAKE THE DECISIONS,

04:29.136 --> 04:32.906
AND I JUST DECIDED THAT...

04:32.973 --> 04:34.675
- [whines]

04:34.742 --> 04:35.643
- YOU'RE MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.810

04:36.877 --> 04:38.178

I DON'T EVEN--

04:38.245 --> 04:39.780
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.814
HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.983
- THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.019
HOW COULD SHE PICK KENDALL
OVER ME?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.523
- I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK HOME.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.224
- I'M SORRY, HONEY,
BUT THE RECORD COMPANY

04:51.359 --> 04:52.960
STOPS PAYING
FOR THIS APARTMENT TOMORROW,

04:53.026 --> 04:54.562
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO STAY HERE.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.098
- [humming]

05:00.501 --> 05:02.636
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.071
- WELL, YOUR LEASE
IS UP TOMORROW,

05:04.137 --> 05:07.408
SO I'M UPGRADING
TO THIS SWEET APARTMENT.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.943
[laughs]

05:10.010 --> 05:13.481
HAVE A PALMWOODS DAY.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.815
- HEY!

05:14.882 --> 05:15.916
- OW!

05:15.983 --> 05:17.518
- WE STILL HAVE ONE DAY
TO RENEW.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.119
- OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,

05:19.186 --> 05:22.623
I'LL NEED
A THREE MONTHS' DEPOSIT NOW.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.791
- UH...

05:23.857 --> 05:24.925
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.727
IN FACT,
THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD RENEW

05:26.794 --> 05:29.397
IS IF YOU GOT A JOB HERE
AT THE PALMWOODS

05:29.430 --> 05:31.465
AND RECEIVED
OUR EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.867
UH, SORRY, NO JOBS AVAILABLE.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.436
OW!

05:35.503 --> 05:38.606
- BITTERS,
I CAN'T STAND WORKING FOR YOU,

05:38.672 --> 05:43.511
SO I QUIT.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.145
- HUH, LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A JOB OPENING

05:45.212 --> 05:46.980
FOR ASSISTANT MANAGER.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.182
- UH, BUT YOUR MOM DOESN'T HAVE
ANY EXPERIENCE,

05:49.249 --> 05:51.419
SO THIS PLACE WILL BE MINE.

05:51.485 --> 05:55.088
[laughing evilly]

05:55.155 --> 05:57.925
CHECKOUT'S AT NOON.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.794
- YOU NEED A POWER SUIT
AND AN AWESOME RESUME.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.029
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.731
I DON'T HAVE
MANAGERIAL EXPERIENCE.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.599
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR RESUME YET.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.669
- WHAT?

06:08.736 --> 06:09.970
- HURRY UP, NEW BOYFRIEND.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.105
I HEARD THE PALMWOODS'
POOL SCENE IS FABTASTIC.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.177
- [breathing heavily]

06:17.244 --> 06:18.746
DO WE REALLY NEED ALL THIS STUFF

06:18.812 --> 06:21.449
JUST FOR YOU
TO SIT BY THE POOL...

06:21.515 --> 06:22.883
PUMPKIN?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.118
- FROOPY CAN ONLY SIT
ON IMPORTED DOG BEDDING,

06:25.185 --> 06:26.554
AND I ALWAYS BRING
MY OWN LOUNGE

06:26.620 --> 06:29.022
SO I NEVER HAVE TO TOUCH
OTHER PEOPLE'S BUTT SWEAT.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.924
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.595
- UGH, UGH...
OHH-OHH-OHHH.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.097
- HEY, BIG GUY,
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.799
- SHE'S HORRIBLE.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.168
- BUT IF SHE LOVES YOU,
THEN SHE'LL PICK OUR DEMOS,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.604
AND WE GET TO STAY IN L.A.,
AND WE'RE ALMOST HALFWAY THERE.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.907
- HOW COULD SHE PICK YOU
OVER ME?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.476
LOOK AT THIS.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.243
- NOW, HERE'S
SOME SUBLIMINAL IMAGERY

06:50.310 --> 06:52.946
THAT WILL HELP HER PICK
OUR DEMOS.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.515
- OOH, AND SOME BREATH SPRAY

06:54.582 --> 06:56.617
JUST IN CASE SHE GOES
TO KISS YOU.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.118
- ACK, I HAVE TO KISS HER?

06:58.185 --> 07:01.088
- WAIT!

07:01.154 --> 07:02.623
- WE CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.
- OHHH.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.525
- NOT WITHOUT
THE PERFECT MOOD MUSIC

07:04.592 --> 07:08.128
FOR YOUR POOL DATE
WITH MERCEDES.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.963
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

07:10.030 --> 07:11.231
- YOU GOT THIS, BIG GUY.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.365
GOOD LUCK.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.333

07:16.970 --> 07:18.071

07:18.138 --> 07:19.940
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

07:20.007 --> 07:21.374
- THIS IS RELAXING.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.710
NOW FAN ME
AND MAKE DOLPHIN NOISES

07:22.776 --> 07:24.011
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN CABO.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.813
- [silently]

07:25.879 --> 07:28.048
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

07:28.115 --> 07:30.518
- [imitating dolphin]

07:30.584 --> 07:32.620
- ISN'T IT GREAT BEING IN LOVE,
NEW BOYFRIEND?

07:32.686 --> 07:35.923
YOU LOVE ME TOO, RIGHT?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.058
YOU HESITATED.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.028
MAYBE I'LL HESITATE TO CHOOSE
YOUR DEMO AS THE WINNER.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.863
I HEARD VAMPIRAH'S AMAZING.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.800
[together]
YOU CAN'T. WHOA-WHOA-WHOA.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.536
- OF COURSE HE LOVES YOU.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.538
I MEAN, WHO--
WHO WOULDN'T LOVE YOU...

07:50.571 --> 07:53.841
WITH YOUR HAIR AND YOUR HANDS

07:53.907 --> 07:56.944
AND THAT RAT-DOG THING?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.079
- IT'S LIKE YOU REALLY KNOW ME.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.814
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.551
YOU'RE MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.352
NOW CARRY ME OUT
LIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIES.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.554
- OOH.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.921
- OLD BOYFRIEND,
BRING MY STUFF UP LATER.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.859
- OOH, HEH-HEH-HEH.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.730
MY MOM WOULD LIKE TO APPLY

08:16.797 --> 08:19.633
FOR THE
ASSISTANT MANAGER POSITION.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.101
- UH, THAT'S RIGHT.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.572
- SORRY, NOT QUALIFIED.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.174

FOR TEN YEARS,
SPEAKS SEVEN LANGUAGES,

08:30.010 --> 08:33.080
AND CAN GO A WEEK

08:36.917 --> 08:39.820
AND MUST BE APPROVED

08:39.887 --> 08:41.589

08:49.229 --> 08:50.631
YOU GOT THE JOB.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.032

- EHH...

08:52.099 --> 08:53.901
SHE WAS THE AMBASSADOR

08:53.967 --> 08:55.769
NOW, GO GET HER
A PALMWOODS JACKET.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.037

08:57.104 --> 09:00.741
- YES, SIR.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.980

BACK IN MINNESOTA.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.181
I WAS A WAITRESS.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.283

CHOP-CHOP.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.934
SHE WON'T LAST A DAY
ON THIS JOB,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.737
AND THAT APARTMENT

09:29.803 --> 09:31.038
[laughs evilly]

09:31.104 --> 09:32.272

09:56.664 --> 09:58.131

09:58.198 --> 09:59.667
I'M A HOCKEY PLAYER.

THESE TASTE LIKE HOCKEY PUCKS.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.936
[dog barks]

10:03.003 --> 10:05.038
I WONDER IF VAMPIRAH
MAKES GREAT COOKIES.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.473
I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT

PRETENDING TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.355
AND, MAN,

11:28.421 --> 11:30.590

MOST BANDS DON'T EVEN MAKE IT
ALMOST HALFWAY THERE.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.390

12:33.186 --> 12:35.956
HOW COULD YOU PICK THEM

12:36.023 --> 12:39.592

12:54.474 --> 12:56.076
- YOU'RE NOT
THE TOP-SECRET MUSIC ADVISER?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.544
- SEE, MY DAD ASKED ME
TO PICK UP THE DEMOS

12:57.610 --> 12:58.912
BECAUSE IT WAS ON MY WAY,

12:58.979 --> 13:01.114
BUT I LET YOU BELIEVE

13:12.092 --> 13:14.494
NOW...
HOW DO THE DEMOS GET PICKED?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.596
- WELL,
FIRST DADDY LOOKS AT THE DEMOS

13:16.663 --> 13:18.465
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE COVERS ARE SHINY.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.933
FROM THERE,
THE GUY WITH WHITE GLOVES

13:20.000 --> 13:24.604
TAKES THEM TO AN UNMARKED DOOR
AT THE END OF A CORRIDOR.

13:24.671 --> 13:29.009

A MONKEY PICKS THE DEMOS?

- NO, A CHIMP,
AND IF HE CLAPS, YOU'RE IN,

13:47.727 --> 13:49.562
BUT IF HE MAKES A FART NOISE,
YOU'RE OUT.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.533
AND SOMETIMES I THINK
DADDY LOVES LO-LO MORE THAN ME.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.734
