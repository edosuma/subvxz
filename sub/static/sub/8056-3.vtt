Support for
Pawnee Community Radio

00:03.469 --> 00:07.008
comes from the Wendell G. and Muriel
Fathwright Korbleman Foundation

00:07.073 --> 00:09.576
and Sweetums Cares,
a non-profit group,

00:09.642 --> 00:13.089
that puts umbrella hats on
homeless people when it rains.

00:14.481 --> 00:17.894
Welcome to Thoughts
for Your Thoughts.

00:17.951 --> 00:22.991
I'm Derry Murbles, filling in for David
Parker, who took off for eight months

00:23.056 --> 00:27.232
to study the migration patterns
of our nation's squirrels.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.562
We have not
seen him since.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.566
My guest today is
author Leslie Knope.

00:32.866 --> 00:37.042
The book, Pawnee: The
Greatest Town in America.

00:37.137 --> 00:40.778
I wrote a book. The first
historical guide to Pawnee.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.611
I wrote it as
a reference for myself,

00:42.675 --> 00:44.211
but then my
campaign advisors said

00:44.277 --> 00:46.018
we should make it
a big, wide release.

00:46.079 --> 00:48.252
So, we had people contribute
and we added pictures

00:48.314 --> 00:49.816
and we removed
a lot of my poems

00:49.883 --> 00:51.624
and emotional ramblings
and pictures of unicorns.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.357
And here it is.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.132
Leslie, could one say

00:56.222 --> 01:00.637
that a book is nothing more
than a painting of words,

01:01.528 --> 01:04.007
which are the notes
on the tapestry

01:04.063 --> 01:07.409
of the greatest film
ever sculpted?

01:08.668 --> 01:10.841
One could say that.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.148
But should one?

01:13.206 --> 01:15.482
Join us next week
when David Bianculli

01:15.542 --> 01:18.386
will be filling in for
Richard Chang-Jefferson,

01:18.445 --> 01:20.152
who will be
filling in for me.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.122
Leslie, would you
like to take us out?

01:23.183 --> 01:24.821
Okay.

01:24.884 --> 01:29.799
Please enjoy a song from the
lesbian Afro-Norwegian funk duo,

01:29.856 --> 01:32.029
Nefertiti's Fjord.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.867
Oh, wow.
They are terrible.

01:39.466 --> 01:44.745
Yes, they're quite awful,
but they are lesbians. So...

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:05.592 --> 02:10.166
Usually, I only read nautical novels
and my own personal manifestos

02:10.229 --> 02:11.641
but I'm proud to
make this exception.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.872
Thank you, Ron. I expect all of
you to buy additional copies.

02:14.934 --> 02:17.073
But I wanted the first
one that you owned

02:17.137 --> 02:19.242
to be delivered
and signed by me.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.679
God, this goes on
for, like, seven pages.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.448
I started thinking
about you as a woman

02:23.510 --> 02:25.353
and as a person,
and I got carried away.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.290
Okay, mine just says,
"Get well soon."

02:28.481 --> 02:29.585
Aren't you sick?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.519
No.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.154
Something's off.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.366
Leslie, I loved your book.
I read it cover to cover.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.197
Wow. I just gave it
to you an hour ago.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.392
I'm a speed reader.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.666
I can read over 3,000 words a
minute, with total comprehension.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.335
One time, I read all of
Siddhartha at a traffic stop.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.044
Pawnee's most notorious
businessman in the building.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.913
I brought some Entertainment 720
pillowcases for your pillow.

02:52.972 --> 02:56.146
Never Stop Dreaming.
Tom Haverford.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.416
I never do. Chris Traeger.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.748
Respect.
Game recognize game.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.850
Tom, I have Pawnee
Today in an hour.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.055
Was my book selected
for Joan's Book Club?

03:05.151 --> 03:07.188
Joan Callamezzo
has a book club?

03:08.221 --> 03:10.701
Joan Callamezzo started
a book club four years ago.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.499
And now, she is the literary
taste-maker in the town.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.562
The Time-Traveler's
Optometrist,

03:15.628 --> 03:17.767
by Pawnee's own
Penelope Foster.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.674
A heartwarming story
about a caveman eye doctor

03:20.733 --> 03:22.872
who travels to
present-day Cincinnati

03:22.936 --> 03:25.007
and can see
everything but love.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.414
Unreadable.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.611
Then, Joan slaps
her sticker on it.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.121
Best-seller four
years in a row.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.850
You told me you could get me that sticker.
Did you get it?

03:32.912 --> 03:35.791
I'm trying, Leslie. But
Joan got an anonymous tip

03:35.848 --> 03:38.590
that there's a factual
inaccuracy in your book.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.631
That's impossible. I checked
every detail with the Historical Society.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.029
Did she say what it was?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.194
She won't tell me.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.101
I think she wants one of
her big "gotcha" moments.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.671
Well, she's not
going to "getch" me.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.337
I find no inaccuracies.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.036
Joan Callamezzo
claims there is a mistake

03:54.100 --> 03:55.909
in my book,
which there is not,

03:55.969 --> 03:58.074
and so now she's trying to get
me on a tiny technicality.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.481
So, just in case there is a
mistake, which there is not,

04:00.540 --> 04:03.282
I need all of you fact-checking
every single detail.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.216
Jerry, I need you
to hit the road

04:05.278 --> 04:06.985
and re-interview everyone
who lives out of town.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.184
On it, boss.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.159
The rest of you, call me
as soon as you find

04:10.216 --> 04:12.059
the mistake that
does not exist.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.295
Do you think there's
actually a mistake in here?

04:15.355 --> 04:18.825
I doubt it. If there's one thing
Leslie's not, it's sloppy.

04:19.459 --> 04:23.532
She's also not brief. This
is going to take forever.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.666
It's just us, I hope.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.766
I wish.

04:25.832 --> 04:29.370
Hey, guys. Ready to do some
fact-checking?

04:29.669 --> 04:32.013
Here we go.
Helping Leslie.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.540
Okey-doke.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.586
Hi. Joan Callamezzo.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.627
Yeah. Hi, Ben Wyatt. We've met.

04:42.882 --> 04:43.917
I don't think so.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.388
Yeah, I was on your show.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.923
Nope.

04:48.988 --> 04:52.026
I'm trying to find the
words to describe this girl

04:52.091 --> 04:54.662
Without being disrespectful

04:54.727 --> 04:57.298
Getting the book into Joan's
Book Club will really help Leslie.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.773
But it will also help my
company, Entertainment 720.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.103
At the risk of bragging,

05:01.167 --> 05:04.046
one of the things I'm best
at is riding coattails.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.242
Behind every
successful man, is me,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.081
smiling and taking
partial credit.

05:08.174 --> 05:11.212
Now, about Leslie's book.
Am I going to be happy?

05:11.577 --> 05:13.818
We'll see, won't we? Hmm?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.926
Wow, you guys are
really cute together.

05:20.119 --> 05:22.656
Ben, I'm cute together
with everybody.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.366
Anyone find any mistakes?

05:25.425 --> 05:29.703
Yeah, actually, in here it
says that Pawnee is great.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.673
But in reality,
it's terrible.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.338
Let Tom know we
haven't found anything.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.174
Hey, I'm thinking
about getting a new phone.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.270
Do you guys
like your phones?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.010
I've never used
a phone in my life.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.844
What about you, Ron?
Do you like your phone?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.814
Mmm.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.884
Here's my goal. I'm going
to get these two people

05:47.947 --> 05:49.790
that I've known
for a long time

05:49.849 --> 05:51.760
to talk to me
for five minutes.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.732
Who am I kidding? One minute.
One minute would be amazing.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.161
So, Leslie, you're a real
native of Pawnee, aren't you?

06:00.460 --> 06:02.770
Yes. I was born
and raised here, Joan.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.742
And I love the town so much, I
literally wrote the book on it.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.773
I have it right here.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.714
And also, in this hand right
here, I have a sticker.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.876
Which, when applied,
legally determines

06:13.940 --> 06:15.647
the newest selection
of Joan's Book Club.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.457
Oh... Oh...Whoa!

06:19.512 --> 06:21.082
Where should... Over here?

06:21.147 --> 06:22.990
Back here?
Where is it now?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.084
Come on. Stick it.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.652
Ooh!

06:27.153 --> 06:28.154
Hang on
Stick the sticker.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.292
No, no, no. Not so fast.
Put it on.

06:30.356 --> 06:34.395
We received a tip that you,
Leslie "Born and Raised" Knope,

06:34.727 --> 06:37.037
were not born in Pawnee.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.071
What?

06:39.298 --> 06:40.333
Gotcha!

06:40.800 --> 06:44.475
Because you lied about it, we cannot
make this a Book Club selection.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.551
I was born in Pawnee. I'd
stake my reputation on it.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.281
I have to tell you. This feels
like "Gotcha" journalism.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.544
In what way?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.782
That way. You put
"Gotcha" on my face.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.018
After the break.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.116
Where was Leslie Knope

06:56.182 --> 06:57.456
actually born?
Pawnee.

06:57.517 --> 07:01.329
We will pull out the world
map and speculate wildly.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.965
Oh, God.
Not the "Gotcha" dancers.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.480
That was despicable I am
horrified at her tactics.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.882
That said, the show was very lively.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.012
Joan "Gotcha"
Don't it hurt ya

07:24.076 --> 07:25.248
It's pretty catchy.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.258
Okay. Ben, Tom, you stay here. Stay on Joan.
Get that sticker.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.884
Chris, Andy, we're going
to stay on schedule

07:29.949 --> 07:31.155
and we're going to do
some damage control.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.629
All right. Everybody, move.
Move, move, move!

07:33.686 --> 07:35.825
This entire event's
under federal jurisdiction.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.925
<i>When Leslie's in trouble, there's
only one man for the job.</i>

07:38.291 --> 07:40.464
Bert Macklin, FBI.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.537
You thought I was dead?

07:44.363 --> 07:46.673
So did
the President's enemies.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.171
Call if you need us. Okay.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.873
All right, so, we don't
have to fact check anymore.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.819
But Leslie wants us
to be on "Ready-Alert One"

07:56.876 --> 07:58.219
just in case
something comes up.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.382
Now, I can get
some real work done.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.419
You know, I think
I'm just gonna

08:05.485 --> 08:07.055
hang out here with you
guys, if that's cool.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.257
It's not.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.027
Great.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.434
I could leave. I could.
But I'm not going to.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.566
I will get my one minute
of small talk, damn it.

08:17.663 --> 08:21.509
And it will be casual
and it will be amicable.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.246
Did Leslie leave?

08:23.302 --> 08:26.306
We wanted her to sign
the "Gotcha" wall.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.477
Joanie, come on now.
What was that?

08:28.541 --> 08:30.316
I thought we were
going to get that sticker.

08:30.443 --> 08:34.323
Sorry, Tom. I am first and
foremost a journalist.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.184
Let us take you
to lunch. Okay?

08:36.249 --> 08:39.856
We'll talk about the book
and whatever else may come up.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.559
Let me go change into something
more tantalizing. All right?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.300
So, what, we're
taking her to lunch now?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.307
Ben,Leslie hired my company
to get her that sticker

08:50.363 --> 08:53.708
You're the one that told me, "Businesses
need clients to get money."

08:54.100 --> 08:55.909
I was the first one
to tell you that?

08:56.135 --> 08:57.512
Don't worry.
This is in the bag.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.009
Joan's a married woman.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.409
She wants what she can't have.
It's a game of cat and mouse.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.689
Thank you all for coming.

09:15.755 --> 09:19.567
Our journey begins on page one, the preface.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.598
Oh, boy. Yes.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.840
I think I speak on
behalf of everyone

09:23.896 --> 09:25.773
in the entire
world when I say,

09:25.831 --> 09:28.607
we need to know the truth about
where you were born

09:28.935 --> 09:30.209
Okay. Well...

09:30.269 --> 09:32.112
Leslie, let me handle this.

09:33.272 --> 09:34.478
Does it really matter?

09:34.540 --> 09:37.453
I mean, how many of you
were actually born in Pawnee?

09:39.512 --> 09:40.889
Fair enough.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.156
No matter what you heard, ma'am,
the truth is I was born here.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.891
If you were so born here, then
where's your birth certificate?

09:48.588 --> 09:51.569
Well, I don't carry my birth
certificate around with me.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.831
Why? Because you're
hiding something?

09:53.893 --> 09:55.600
You should go back
where you came from.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.468
I am back from
where I came from.

09:57.763 --> 10:01.006
That sentence was confusing! You
might as well be from China!

10:01.067 --> 10:02.546
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.842
I'm from here.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.143
This crowd is getting
very hostile, Ms. Knope,

10:05.204 --> 10:06.205
I'm going to get
you out of here.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.808
Oh, my God.
Back off!

10:08.975 --> 10:10.010
Bye, everybody.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.146
When I was 18,

10:12.578 --> 10:17.391
Val Kilmer saw me at a mall
and told me I should model.

10:18.718 --> 10:19.992
That never happened.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.532
So, Joan, how is married
life treating you?

10:22.588 --> 10:24.590
Your husband still know he's
the luckiest man in the world?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.293
Santino and I are divorcing. Oh.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.266
It's actually
quite liberating.

10:29.328 --> 10:32.798
I'm a woman with
a strong sexual appetite.

10:33.099 --> 10:37.844
I'm like a caged peacock yearning
for the wind on her haunches.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.517
That's a powerful metaphor.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.179
Maybe we can get that
book club sticker in order,

10:43.242 --> 10:45.654
and we can work on
unlocking that peacock cage.

10:45.711 --> 10:49.090
Things have changed, Tom. Don't
make any promises you can't keep.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.757
I'll have another drink,

10:51.817 --> 10:56.266
and so will this adorable
hunk of caramel to my right.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.197
Drink up, Tom. I'm going
to go powder my nose.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.663
Amongst other things.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.866
If you know what I mean.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.401
Crap.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.040
Is she going to
powder her vagina?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.207
You've got to
help me, man.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.877
Why? Seems to be going
the usual amount of gross.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.817
No, this is way different.
She's not married anymore.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.220
She had, like, five bottles of alcohol.
She's calling me "caramel."

11:19.278 --> 11:21.087
You've got to throw some
cold water on the situation.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.319
Start talking
about nerd stuff.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.361
You know, nerd culture
is mainstream now.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.193
So, when you use the word
"nerd" derogatorily,

11:27.253 --> 11:28.891
it means you're the one
that's out of the Zeitgeist.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.833
Yes, that's perfect. Just like that.
Be incredibly boring.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.664
Well, I've made
a little progress.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.238
I'm up to four
seconds with April.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.943
Hey, April. I was looking
to get some new music.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.104
And I was wondering if you
could recommend anything.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.335
The Internet.

11:43.602 --> 11:45.377
I really like your haircut.
Where did you get it?

11:45.805 --> 11:46.806
Prison.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.909
How is your sister doing?
She has the shingles.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.976
Who is your favorite character
on Sex and the City?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.015
ALF.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.252
And nine seconds with Ron.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.093
You're stranded
on a desert island,

11:57.149 --> 11:58.992
what is the one thing
that you bring with you?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.298
Silence.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.494
We did a flash poll.

12:08.594 --> 12:11.939
68% of Pawneeans now believe you're
lying about where you were born.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.772
Honesty is important
to voters.

12:13.833 --> 12:18.009
13% think I'm crazy-eyed?
What? Why?

12:18.070 --> 12:21.347
Whatever. I can end this now. Here
is my birth certificate. Mmm-hmm.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.017
Well, this just
says Wamapoke County.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.578
Yeah. That's the county
Pawnee is in.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.123
Well, no.
This won't do it.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.255
See, you staked your
reputation on this.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.420
So, you need to go down to the
county records office in Eagleton

12:31.484 --> 12:33.327
and get the original,
long-form certificate.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.355
God, don't make me
go to Eagleton.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.231
<i>Eagleton is the land
of rich, snobby jerks.</i>

12:38.324 --> 12:40.463
There's a whole chapter
about it in my book.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.029
I could write a second book about
Eagleton and how stupid it is.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.406
<i>And I'd call it, Eagleton: The
Land of Rich, Snobby Jerks</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:49.969
Hello, and welcome to the
Wamapoke County Records office

12:50.035 --> 12:52.106
here in beautiful Eagleton.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.809
My name is
Alexis Pratchett.

12:53.873 --> 12:57.946
Take it down a notch, Alexis. I need
a copy of my birth certificate.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.450
Oh, I'm sorry. It takes
three to eight weeks

13:00.513 --> 13:01.821
to receive
a birth certificate.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.319
Really?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.097
Hi, I'm Chris.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.635
I was wondering if you might
make an exception for me.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.128
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.799
Wow. That usually works.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.605
Oh, God. I hate
this stupid town

13:20.666 --> 13:22.441
with all its stupid,
terrible people.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.741
I need that
birth certificate.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.409
Leslie, wait here.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.349
Bert Macklin
is on the case.

13:28.607 --> 13:29.881
Andy.
No.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.182
Don't worry.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.057
I can do this.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.490
Believe in me.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.888
That's broken.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.834
Hold on. Leslie, real quick.
Spell your last name for me.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.769
Let's hear it for the boys

13:51.831 --> 13:55.438
Wow. That was as
long as it was loud.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.442
Take me home, dumpling.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.313
- It's beddy time.
- Uh...

14:00.372 --> 14:03.478
Hey, Ben, you like Star Trek.
Talk about that for a little bit.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.547
They're making a sequel.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.953
I'm assuming with the
same alternate timeline.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.393
But if J.J. Abrams and
company expect us to believe

14:12.451 --> 14:15.830
that it's Spock with the romantic
tension with Uhura and not Kirk

14:15.888 --> 14:18.198
well, let'sj ust say the
message boards are going nuts.

14:19.658 --> 14:23.765
I want to take you both
home and...bend you over

14:23.829 --> 14:28.471
and just...at
the same time.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.503
Whoo!

14:30.569 --> 14:31.639
I'm leaving.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.739
Let's do this.

14:32.805 --> 14:33.875
We've got to get her home.

14:33.939 --> 14:37.477
Tom, I know your business is failing,
but this just isn't worth it.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.114
It's not about the business anymore, man.
She's a disaster.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.056
We've got to make sure
she gets home safe.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.189
Whoa!

14:47.253 --> 14:49.790
What the hell? Okay,
let's get her on the bed.

14:49.855 --> 14:50.925
Okay. One...

14:50.990 --> 14:52.025
Oh, my God.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.900
Two...
Two...

14:53.959 --> 14:55.632
Three.
Three.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.478
Say what you will about Joan, but she
knows how to decorate a bedroom.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.445
Wow.
Oh, my God.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.846
Where the hell am I?

15:06.272 --> 15:08.013
I just want to see how soft
these sheets are. One second.

15:08.073 --> 15:11.054
Tom. No. Come on. Let's go.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.953
Joan, we left you some water
and aspirin by the bed!

15:13.012 --> 15:14.286
Bye!

15:16.148 --> 15:18.424
Got it! Got it!

15:18.484 --> 15:19.724
Nice!

15:19.785 --> 15:22.425
I also got this dude's briefcase.
It was just laying there.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.523
Kind of a panic move.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.092
I believed in you.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.160
But you should put that back.
Okay.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.939
Okay, so,
Leslie Barbara Knope.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.498
Born January 18
to Robert and Marlene Knope

15:32.564 --> 15:34.043
in Eagleton, Indiana.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.076
I'm from Eagleton.

15:41.907 --> 15:45.753
Is it true, Mom?
Was I born in Eagleton?

15:46.645 --> 15:47.680
Yes, it's true.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.918
No.

15:48.981 --> 15:52.394
Pawnee Hospital was overrun
with raccoons at the time,

15:52.451 --> 15:54.226
so we had to go to
the next closest hospital.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.424
No.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.798
I'm sorry. Did you expect
me to give birth to you

15:58.857 --> 16:01.235
in an infested,
disease-filled room?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.534
Mom, why didn't
you tell me?

16:03.762 --> 16:06.709
You try telling that little
girl she's not from Pawnee.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.369
I certainly couldn't.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.847
So you were technically
born in Eagleton. Who cares?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.279
I care.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.410
The people of Pawnee care.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.580
I wrote on the cover of my book
that I was born in Pawnee.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.490
I went on Pawnee Today,
and I called Joan a liar.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.259
I'm the liar.
I'm worse than a liar.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.389
I'm an...

16:31.123 --> 16:32.625
Eagletonian.

16:33.525 --> 16:36.631
Good morning.
ls Leslie here?

16:36.895 --> 16:42.038
Oh, man, I am so tired I took a
half-shift at the hospital last night.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.945
And I had this
really weird patient.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.649
Weird how?

16:48.707 --> 16:50.448
I probably shouldn't
talk about it.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.886
It's one of the grossest
things I've ever seen.

16:52.878 --> 16:53.879
Talk.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.325
Well, this guy came in. He got his
hand stuck in a Pringles can,

16:57.950 --> 16:59.520
and he tried to
cut himself out.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.587
Was there a lot of blood? What
kind of blade did he use?

17:02.421 --> 17:04.230
Three and a half inch.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.290
Serrated.
Buckets of blood.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.339
He passed out over his arm
and slumped onto the floor.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.665
Did the bone show?

17:10.729 --> 17:12.766
Very good question, April.
Answer her.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.074
Yeah. The bone showed.

17:15.134 --> 17:18.343
Everyone in the universe
loves a gross medical story.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.611
Boom! l win!

17:20.739 --> 17:24.084
And so, when I finally cleaned
up the vomit, I found the toe.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.713
I forgot about the toe.
So did we.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.813
Crazy, right?

17:26.878 --> 17:28.358
That story's awesome.

17:28.414 --> 17:31.327
Indeed. Thank you
for sharing, Jenny.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.431
Ann was getting
a little chummy.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.968
When people get
too chummy with me,

17:39.024 --> 17:40.594
I like to call them
by the wrong name

17:40.659 --> 17:43.333
to let them know I don't
really care about them.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.931
That's a genius move.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.271
Thank you.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.538
You're welcome, Lester.

17:50.936 --> 17:54.440
Oh, my God. I wonder who
else was born in Eagleton.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.816
Voldemort, probably.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.419
Bad news, team.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.481
Entertainment 720 was unable to get
the sticker for Leslie's book.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.254
The sticker is
the least of my problems.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.625
If I come clean
about where I'm from,

18:05.684 --> 18:07.960
then my
political career is over.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.790
You don't have to
tell them a damned thing.

18:09.855 --> 18:13.132
The only thing the voters need
to know about you is your name.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.103
And even that,
I go back and forth on.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.800
I'm sorry,
but I disagree.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.934
Leslie, where you were born
is a piece of trivia.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.472
Where you're from?

18:21.533 --> 18:25.071
That's what makes you who you are.
And you are from Pawnee.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.748
You're more Pawnee
than anyone I know.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.518
So, I say tell
them the truth,

18:29.575 --> 18:32.021
and trust that they're
going to respect you for it.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.991
Damn it.
He's right. Well said.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.285
Thanks, Ron.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.657
You're welcome, Steve.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.294
Joan.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.665
Thanks so much for having
Leslie back on the program.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.235
Well, thank you for
getting me home last night.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.503
I wasn't feeling very well.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.509
Because of some
bad seafood that I ate.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.105
Yes. That's probably
what it was.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.581
I'd like to apologize to
those that I've misled.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.484
I thought I was
telling the truth.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.280
But sadly,
I was born in Eagleton.

19:09.681 --> 19:12.924
Well, that is worse than I
ever could have hoped for.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.625
I learned something, Joan.
It's not where you're born.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.132
It's where you're from.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.731
When I was nine years
old, I broke my arm

19:20.792 --> 19:24.763
sledding on that giant hill behind
Kernston's Rubber Nipple factory.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.503
You know, Nipple Hill.
Of course.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.169
It gets very slippery there.
I know that.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.871
Especially when it's wet.
Yes.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.575
And Jim, Jim Kabernick.
I know Jim.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.639
Jim and I have gone
to school together

19:33.705 --> 19:34.775
since we were, like,
three years old.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.841
Yes, that's true.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.650
Do you remember when you peed
your pants in second grade?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.656
Why did you bring that up?
I said yes.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.988
You stuck your underwear in your
drawer and you got real embarrassed,

19:43.048 --> 19:44.686
and then the teacher came
over and pulled them out?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.286
And everybody
called you "the gerbil"

19:46.351 --> 19:48.524
because you always smelled
like soiled wood chips?

19:48.587 --> 19:50.533
Leslie, for God's sake.
We're on TV.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.559
The point is, you can't
choose where you were born,

19:53.625 --> 19:54.865
but you can choose
where you live.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.634
I love this town.
I always have.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.404
I always will.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.274
And that's why I
wrote a book about it.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.940
And that's why I'm running
for City Council.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.910
<i>Look, I'm not crazy.</i>

20:09.975 --> 20:13.479
I know Pawnee isn't Paris,
or London, or Chicago.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.889
But it's a great place
to live and work.

20:16.715 --> 20:20.686
And serving the goofballs in this
town is an honor and a privilege.

20:20.752 --> 20:24.598
And yes, every town claims its diner's
waffles are the best in the world.

20:24.656 --> 20:29.401
But somewhere, in some town, there really
are the best waffles in the world.

20:29.461 --> 20:32.408
So delicious and rich
and golden brown

20:32.464 --> 20:37.675
that anyone who tasted them would
decide never to leave that town.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.115
Somewhere,
those waffles exist.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.219
Why can't it be here?

20:44.476 --> 20:46.786
Joan put us
in her book club.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.518
Although I could
do without this.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.529
Leslie? Here's the thing.
I've been all over the state.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.998
Indianapolis, Bloomington,
Lafayette, Muncie, Gary,

20:57.055 --> 20:58.432
all the places you
mention in the book.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.334
And I've interviewed
all the people you mentioned.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.839
And so far, there is
not one incorrect fact.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.966
So, now, I am going to head to
the house, say hey to Gayle,

21:06.031 --> 21:08.534
wish my daughter a happy belated
birthday, it was yesterday

21:08.600 --> 21:10.102
and then, I'm going
to head back out

21:10.168 --> 21:11.738
and hit all the towns
in the southeast.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.310
But is there anything I should know?
Any new info?

21:17.075 --> 21:18.076
Nope.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.349
You're doing great.
Godspeed.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.357
Doing what I can.
Yep.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.084
Got to go, Donna.
Can't talk.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.989
He just seems so happy.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.222
I didn't say anything.

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
