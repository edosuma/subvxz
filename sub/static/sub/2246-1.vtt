00:41.124 --> 00:42.417
- Oh, much obliged, ma'am.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.585
That--oh, that looks so tasty.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.628
- Oh, you're so welcome.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.797
Smells wonderful.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.298
- Thank you.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.303
- Hey, about a pot
of hot coffee?

00:53.303 --> 00:55.305
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.142
- Hope you brought back
a powerful appetite with you.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.812
Can you believe this snow?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.480
You boys keep working that hard,

01:03.480 --> 01:05.732
you're gonna have
this whole forest chopped.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.527
- Yeah,
maybe we should slow down,

01:08.527 --> 01:10.320
go half speed.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.155
What do you say, boss?

01:12.155 --> 01:15.200
- You go half speed,
I'll cut you half speed.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.702
- All I'm saying is,

01:16.702 --> 01:18.745
it takes some time for these
big trees to grow back.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.498
Don't it?
- Trees are trees.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.626
More people are building
houses now, closer together.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.211
You look at your kitchen window,

01:26.211 --> 01:27.838
you can look
in your neighbor's bedroom.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.132
You take it from me, young man.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.177
The future of this great country
is home ownership.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.179
Now, I want you guys
to get some rest tonight

01:35.179 --> 01:38.599
'cause tomorrow we're gonna cut
20 acres of God's green timber.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.601
When's this thing gonna be done,
Elmer?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.352
- Chow's ready boss.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.355
Meat's practically falling off
the bone.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.357
- Ain't bad, Elmer.
It ain't too bad.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.193
- Much obliged, boss.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.403
- Save me some.
I'll be back.

01:55.365 --> 01:59.870
- You got another log jam
to take care of, boss?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.127
That's the third time today
for him.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.711
- Well, for a great big bear
of a man,

02:08.711 --> 02:12.216
boss sure has the itty-bitty
bowels of a squirrel.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.550
Ring the dinner bell, kid.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.676
Tell the men to come on over.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.887
Chow's ready.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.773
- Smells good, y'all.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.496
- Hey.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.461
Hey, hey.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.528
These monkeys
are gonna get themselves hurt.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.912
- No, not a problem.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.830
We'll be here.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.671
- Miss cow-wow-zinkowski?

06:19.671 --> 06:22.508
- Please,
my friends call me Sam.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.134
- Sergeant hoke,
and I don't have any friends,

06:24.134 --> 06:26.094
so you will address me
as sergeant hoke.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.014
- Oh...
Okay.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.144
- Here they come now.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.416
Let's see who we got here.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.420
D.O.C. Number 6-8-2-9-0,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.464
Martin Williams,

07:02.464 --> 07:04.132
felony robbery.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.051
- Is this really necessary?

07:06.051 --> 07:10.556
- Move it along,
chicken little.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.684
D.O.C. Number 9-0-2-1-1,

07:13.684 --> 07:17.688
Trish gauge, three counts
of assault on a police officer.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.653
Fall in, prairie dog.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.910
D.O.C. Number 2-0-0-6-8,

07:31.910 --> 07:36.165
zachery Moore,
drug trafficking.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.584
- You can call me Zack.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.919
- I'll be keeping
a real special eye on you.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.006
Move along, wasted space.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.637
D.O.C. Number 1-8-7-5-0,
rosa villa.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.223
Well, contempt of court.
Couldn't have guessed.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.851
Fall in there, thornbush.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.208
- Hi, ray Tanner,
dropping off my daughter.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.631
D.O.C number 1-7-9-0-1,
Claire Tanner,

08:25.631 --> 08:27.758
drunk driving, bodily injury.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.760
You are late; If you are
trying to get on my good side,

08:29.760 --> 08:31.762
you have failed.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.554
Now, get in line, happy hour.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.981
- Hey, is that thing necessary?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.775
- Well, you never know
who you might run into

08:44.775 --> 08:46.777
in the deep, dark woods.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.577
Toe the line.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.956
That means toes on the line.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.125
Yes, this will include you,
wasted space.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.293
Toe the line.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.802
Now, you all have had
the good fortune

09:11.802 --> 09:15.973
to be a part of the state's
first offender program,

09:15.973 --> 09:21.144
what I like to refer to as
the get-out-of-jail-free card.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.605
There's only one problem,
kiddies.

09:23.605 --> 09:27.025
I'm the one
holding all the cards.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.945
And I'm sergeant a. Hoke,

09:29.945 --> 09:31.989
and as of right now,

09:31.989 --> 09:34.658
you are all my s.T.U.M.P.S.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.952
All right, s.T.U.M.P.S.

09:36.952 --> 09:40.622
All aboard sergeant hoke's
happy short bus.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.585
Get on board.
Double time.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.795
Double time,
or you will be left behind,

09:46.795 --> 09:48.172
and I will fail you.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.841
Move, move, move.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.011
Do you require assistance,
madam?

09:54.011 --> 09:57.181
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

10:29.713 --> 10:34.051
- You're a cube rat, never spent
any time in the field.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.886
- Not exactly.
I have an office.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.223
Nice refurbished couch,
a great one.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.891
Tea tray.

10:40.891 --> 10:45.229
- Have you ever spent any time
outdoors?

10:45.229 --> 10:47.356
- I spend more time indoors.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.399
Got my master's in social work

10:49.399 --> 10:52.194
with a focus
on criminal justice.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.197
- I don't remember asking
for your resume.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.828
Miss k., why are you here?

11:01.828 --> 11:05.415
- There's plenty of punishment
built into the system.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.253
I'm here to reform, to help.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.297
Well, shit, Sam.
Me too.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.050
Me too.

11:17.094 --> 11:20.222
- Felony robbery.
Chicken little.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.058
You don't look the type.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.018
- Wait a minute.
I know you.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.355
Internet hacker, stole, like,
12 mil from the government.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.191
- It was only 11.5.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.819
The IRS likes to round shit up.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.946
- What's it like
to spend all that money?

11:35.946 --> 11:38.282
- Yeah, what did you buy?

11:38.282 --> 11:41.243
- Never had a chance
to roll around in it.

11:41.243 --> 11:45.372
Just numbers on a screen.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.957
- You?

11:46.957 --> 11:49.710
Miss badass.
- What?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.795
- Assault a cop three times.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.131
I dig it.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.049
- That's bullshit.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.802
I only punched him once.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.387
- What about you, c.B.?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.181
You doing all right back there?

12:02.181 --> 12:03.307
Need a drink?

12:05.184 --> 12:06.476
- Nice.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.315
- S.T.U.M.P., remain seated
while the vehicle is in motion.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.150
This is not a pleasure cruise.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.030
- S.T.U.M.P.S?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.490
- Stupid teenagers
under my protection.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.993
- Technically
they're not all teenagers.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.501
- I'd appreciate it--

12:30.501 --> 12:32.336
and I'm sure the other
passengers would too--

12:32.336 --> 12:34.171
if you didn't smoke.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.510
I'm not sure
I approve of your style.

12:39.510 --> 12:43.013
- Well, then this is going
to get interesting.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.854
Miss k., welcome to my world.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.106
- This is gonna be interesting.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.110
- S.T.U.M.P.S, get off the bus.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.621
- This is where we're staying?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.460
- This place is a pile.

14:45.010 --> 14:48.388
- S.T.U.M.P.S, toe the line.

15:05.239 --> 15:09.117
You are all here
because you have made choices

15:09.117 --> 15:12.037
that most people would describe

15:12.037 --> 15:15.582
as piss-poor.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.506
The courts have given you
this one last chance

15:22.506 --> 15:25.175
to get your shit together,

15:25.175 --> 15:28.679
or your shit
will get pushed in in prison.

15:32.015 --> 15:36.144
- Today you are all s.T.U.M.P.S,

15:36.144 --> 15:38.522
but when I am through with you,

15:38.522 --> 15:42.359
you will have grown
into trees...

15:45.112 --> 15:50.325
And productive members
of society.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.038
Miss k.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.040
- Hi.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.376
We're gonna have a great week.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.669
There will be
physical challenges

16:00.669 --> 16:02.504
led by sergeant hoke,

16:02.504 --> 16:06.383
and I'll be continuing
our counseling sessions here.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.427
By the end of the week,
we hope this experience

16:08.427 --> 16:11.722
inspires you to make changes
in your life

16:11.722 --> 16:13.223
and better choices.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.018
- I choose to go somewhere else.

16:16.018 --> 16:19.396
- Yeah, I don't want to stay
in that dump for a week.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.731
- Shut it!

16:20.731 --> 16:22.566
S.T.U.M.P.S don't stay
in the cabin.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.027
S.T.U.M.P.S stay outside.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.155
S.T.U.M.P.S, set up the tents
by the campfire circle.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.406
Move out.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.087
Hold on.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.344
- I'm not sharing a tent
with you.

16:50.344 --> 16:52.471
- Oh, I know.
I'll be sleeping in the cabin.

16:52.471 --> 16:53.764
- What?

16:53.764 --> 16:55.599
- I'm not here
to share anything,

16:55.599 --> 16:57.142
least of all hardships.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.435
I may not have a fancy degree,

16:58.435 --> 17:00.479
but s-g-t,

17:00.479 --> 17:02.314
it's got its privileges.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.693
- Several people got shot.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.279
It was a drive-by.

18:32.279 --> 18:36.617
The d.A. Wanted me to testify,
but I couldn't.

18:36.617 --> 18:40.370
I was worried for myra,
my daughter.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.456
- You have a daughter?
- Yeah.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.209
- Whoa, serious m.I.L.F.-Age.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.546
- When I get out of here,
I'm gonna get her back.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.673
- Hey, I cut a deal
to get out the bigger fish.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.217
You got busted for talking.

18:53.217 --> 18:55.260
Talking's what saved my ass.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.720
- Figures.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.140
A hood rat like you
selling drugs.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.769
- Hey, I had friends,
and they needed things.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.854
Just so happens
what they needed wasn't legal.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.525
- What you do differently
if you could go back in time?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.238
- Probably invest in Google.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.618
- Trish, you're up.

19:21.245 --> 19:25.332
There was this bar fight.
Cops showed up.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.417
One of them asked me
what happened,

19:27.417 --> 19:32.256
and the officer behind him
wouldn't stop staring at my ass.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.468
- So I popped him.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.720
- Excuse me, ma'am,
but you do have a nice ass.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.518
- C.B., it's your turn.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.854
- I was coming back
from a party.

19:46.854 --> 19:50.399
I was a little buzzed.

19:50.399 --> 19:52.943
The car in front of me
ran this red light.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.571
I couldn't stop in time,
and I hit him.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.531
The driver got thrown
from the car.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.950
- You weren't hurt at all?

19:59.950 --> 20:02.578
- Just a little cut on my knee.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.538
The other driver
wasn't hurt either,

20:04.538 --> 20:06.957
but he reeked of booze.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.626
- He was drunk too?

20:09.626 --> 20:12.462
- It was his third offense
for drunk driving.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.505
- Oh.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.798
- He hit three cars in town

20:14.798 --> 20:17.885
before he ran that light.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.512
- You stopped that guy
from killing someone.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.972
You deserve--

20:21.972 --> 20:24.433
you deserve a medal
rather than being here.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.767
- That's right.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.854
The system is messed up.
It's not fair.

20:28.854 --> 20:32.357
- Well, two d.U.I.S
don't make a right.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.775
She did break the law.

20:33.775 --> 20:37.279
- Screw that.
I would've hired a lawyer.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.655
Sued him for a million.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.366
- A million?
I would've got 12 million.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.827
- My lawyer said it was better
to just plead guilty

20:43.827 --> 20:45.287
than to fight it.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.498
- And you thought
that was unfair.

20:47.498 --> 20:51.001
- He ran the light.
I was just a little buzzed.

20:51.001 --> 20:54.338
Nobody could've stopped in time.

20:54.338 --> 20:55.672
I shouldn't be here.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.257
- No one thinks
they should be here.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.010
- Hey, I'm glad you're all here.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.513
We all have things
we keep inside,

21:02.513 --> 21:05.349
stuff we don't want to share.

21:05.349 --> 21:06.850
By the time we're finished,

21:06.850 --> 21:08.560
I'm hoping we've all grown
into something

21:08.560 --> 21:10.395
bigger than ourselves.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.942
- Trees grow tall,
and then the trees fall!

21:14.942 --> 21:16.693
- What the--
- but the river--

21:16.693 --> 21:19.738
the river only goes one way.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.698
- Sir,
this is a private meeting.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.617
I'd appreciate it
if you'd moved on.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.327
- Is he part of the program?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.870
- Somebody grab the camera.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.373
I think we just found bigfoot.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.666
- God damn it, s.T.U.M.P.S.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.292
What in the name
of sweet Lorraine

21:32.292 --> 21:33.877
is going on out here?

21:33.877 --> 21:36.755
Oh, hello, meeks.
I thought I smelled you.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.717
Fire's a fire.
I'm just keeping warm.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.053
That's all.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.430
- You got my invitation
to the party then.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.682
Oh, you know, that's funny,

21:46.682 --> 21:48.392
'cause I didn't send you one.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.685
Now, I want you to clear out
of here

21:49.685 --> 21:52.354
and stop interrupting
my angry sleep.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.606
I've got this campground
for the next six days,

21:54.606 --> 21:56.567
and that means six days,
I don't see you,

21:56.567 --> 21:58.777
I don't hear you, and I sure as
hell don't want to smell you.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.445
Savvy?

22:00.445 --> 22:01.572
- Yeah.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.073
Well, now,

22:03.073 --> 22:08.745
we all got things
we want to hide,

22:08.745 --> 22:11.665
and we all
just want to be wanted.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.626
Oh, and while
you're sleeping tonight,

22:14.626 --> 22:16.086
all nice and cozy,

22:16.086 --> 22:18.088
look out for them little--
them little critters,

22:18.088 --> 22:21.091
because they like to find
a nice little warm spot

22:21.091 --> 22:22.801
to crawl up into, you know--

22:26.096 --> 22:27.681
- Jesus.

22:27.681 --> 22:28.765
- Yahoo!

22:29.766 --> 22:31.768
- Holy shit.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.646
- You just met
some of the local wildlife.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.107
His name is meeks--
lives up here on the Mountain.

22:37.107 --> 22:40.611
Pretty sure he's harmless.
- Pretty sure?

22:40.611 --> 22:42.905
- All right, everybody.
Let's get back to the session.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.781
- No, no, no, session's over.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.617
You s.T.U.M.P.S needs to get
some shut-eye.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.036
0500 comes awfully early
in the morning.

22:49.036 --> 22:51.121
- 5:00?
Is he crazy?

22:51.121 --> 22:52.831
- Move out, s.T.U.M.P.S.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.458
Let's go.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.793
Hit the hay.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.545
5:00.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.924
I don't even think my clock
has a five on it.

23:01.924 --> 23:04.051
- We'll continue this later.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.469
- Good night, sister.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.043
- Where have you been?
- Shh.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.087
Shut up and fuck me.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.620
There you go.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.205
Yeah.

24:38.729 --> 24:42.232
You've broken the first rule
of the camp.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.901
If you do it again,
I have to write you up,

24:43.901 --> 24:45.235
and that means you're gone.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.863
- Here.
- So, Trish, out.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.740
Now.

24:56.121 --> 24:57.789
- Thanks.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.592
- What happened?

25:08.592 --> 25:10.511
- You were snoring.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.888
- Oh, sorry.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.271
- Morning, ladies.
Stop dreaming.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.274
Time to wake up
to the nightmare.

25:24.274 --> 25:25.943
Good morning, gentlemen.

25:25.943 --> 25:27.819
Drop your cocks
and grab your socks.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.822
We're going on a hike!

25:30.822 --> 25:34.284
- Another beautiful day
in paradise, chicken little.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.204
- I hope you enjoyed your
accommodations last evening.

25:37.204 --> 25:38.872
Compared to today,

25:38.872 --> 25:40.582
it's gonna feel like
a five-star resort.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.044
Today we are going on a hike.
Going off-road.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.964
We're going to blaze
our own trail.

25:53.220 --> 25:56.682
- Wow, this is nice in here.

25:56.682 --> 26:00.185
Fire, mini fridge...

26:01.770 --> 26:03.939
Reading material.

26:05.566 --> 26:08.110
A guide to eastern philosophies
and religion?

26:08.110 --> 26:10.696
I'm shocked; You read.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.282
- It's just the next book
I throw on the fire.

26:17.161 --> 26:20.330
- Can you do me a favor
and leave that behind?

26:20.330 --> 26:22.583
You're intimidating enough
without it.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.937
You happy?
- Yeah.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.689
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.983
- Well, I hope you can keep up.

26:47.983 --> 26:50.611
March.
Move it out.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.863
Move!

26:52.863 --> 26:54.865
Left! Left!

26:54.865 --> 26:56.825
Left, right, left!

26:56.825 --> 26:58.827
Left! Left!

26:58.827 --> 27:01.788
Left, right, left!

27:01.788 --> 27:03.999
Tell me, happy hour,
when you had to walk the line,

27:03.999 --> 27:05.709
was it left, right, left?

27:05.709 --> 27:08.003
Your field sobriety test,
do you remember?

27:08.003 --> 27:11.256
Or were you too blacked out?

27:11.256 --> 27:13.217
And you.
You like to fight, huh?

27:13.217 --> 27:15.052
When I'm done with you,
you'll be able to take on

27:15.052 --> 27:16.678
a whole battalion!

27:16.678 --> 27:19.056
I'm sure
that'll make your daddy proud!

27:19.056 --> 27:21.058
Left, right, left!

27:21.058 --> 27:22.392
Left, right, left!

27:22.392 --> 27:24.728
Do you have two left feet, son?

27:24.728 --> 27:27.731
Left, right, left,
wasted space!

27:27.731 --> 27:31.985
Make a hell of
a ballroom dancer.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.320
Chicken little, I'm sorry.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.780
There's no Internet out here.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.950
You cannot Google
left, right, left.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.077
Very good, thornbush.
I like your intensity.

27:40.077 --> 27:43.997
Your attitude may actually work
for you out here.

27:43.997 --> 27:47.918
You're gonna repeat after me.

leave you on this Mountain.

28:39.845 --> 28:41.263
Move, move, move!

28:41.263 --> 28:43.724
Up that hill.
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

28:43.724 --> 28:45.100
Navigate through those trunks.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.810
These stumps represent you.

28:46.810 --> 28:48.437
This is what you are.
You are stumps.

28:48.437 --> 28:50.480
You want to grow
into those mighty trees.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.858
That's what you want to be.

29:26.850 --> 29:27.851
Your move.

29:42.115 --> 29:45.869
- All right, s.T.U.M.P.S!
Get across that river.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.497
This is where we'll picnic
for lunch.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.207
Move, move, move!

29:52.376 --> 29:53.919
Please join me for a meal

29:53.919 --> 29:57.339
prepared by the great state
of Minnesota,

29:57.339 --> 30:01.260
the correctional department,
and my own two loving hands.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.151
Not doing too bad.

30:18.151 --> 30:21.947
- For a cube rat.
- Right.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.074
- You wouldn't really
leave me behind, would you?

30:24.074 --> 30:26.118
- Oh, absolutely.

30:34.543 --> 30:38.213
- I'll kill for a burger
and fries right now.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.174
- How about just a shake?

30:40.174 --> 30:42.092
- Yo, this dude's crazy.

30:42.092 --> 30:44.595
I can't do this all week.
I'm out of here.

30:44.595 --> 30:46.138
- I don't know, man.

30:46.138 --> 30:47.890
- You want to be worked
to death?

30:47.890 --> 30:49.975
- I don't want to work at all.

30:49.975 --> 30:51.351
- Who's with me?

30:54.062 --> 30:55.230
- Count me in.

30:55.230 --> 30:57.191
- Where are you gonna go?

30:57.191 --> 30:59.026
Like you could find
your way back.

30:59.026 --> 31:02.321
- We came up here;
We can get back down.

31:02.321 --> 31:05.616
- No one likes this shit,
but it beats jail time.

31:05.616 --> 31:07.618
- Screw you guys.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.119
I'm gonna find a way
out of here.

31:15.459 --> 31:18.212
- This guy's gonna get us all
in trouble.

31:48.492 --> 31:51.411
I know that guy's a hard-ass,
but look,

31:51.411 --> 31:54.164
if we stick together,
we can get through this thing.

31:54.164 --> 31:57.084
- Man, I hate that fucker.

31:57.084 --> 31:59.336
I'm gonna frag him in his sleep.

32:02.256 --> 32:03.340
- What's that?

32:05.551 --> 32:07.344
Shit.

32:13.141 --> 32:15.227
- Yo, what is this?

32:18.438 --> 32:22.484
- Check it out.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.694
- What is it?

32:27.698 --> 32:30.492
- I don't even know.

32:35.581 --> 32:38.208
Dude, what are you doing?

32:38.208 --> 32:41.211
- Fuckin' "a."

32:41.211 --> 32:43.338
I'm taking a souvenir.

32:46.216 --> 32:47.634
- Come on, man.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.511
We need to get back
before sergeant hokeypokey

32:49.511 --> 32:51.722
comes looking for us.

32:51.722 --> 32:54.224
Come on.

33:09.740 --> 33:13.452
Hey, check out what we found.

33:13.452 --> 33:15.120
- Where did you get that?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.372
- Big deal.
It's a cow horn.

33:17.372 --> 33:19.750
- Uh, excuse me.
Cows don't have horns.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.336
- Just leave it.
- What?

33:22.336 --> 33:24.129
I'm gonna make a bong
out of this thing.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.215
I got get something
out of this shitty program.

33:26.215 --> 33:28.759
- Hell, yeah.
- That was a living creature.

33:28.759 --> 33:30.260
You shouldn't smoke out of it.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.221
- What?
It's just some old dead cow.

33:32.221 --> 33:36.475
- You mean bull.
- I know, smart-ass.

33:36.475 --> 33:38.519
- What's going on here?

33:38.519 --> 33:40.270
What is that?

33:40.270 --> 33:42.105
Do you think
this is a scavenger hunt?

33:42.105 --> 33:43.232
It's not.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.733
I know you, boy,

33:44.733 --> 33:48.111
all strut and no gut.

33:48.111 --> 33:50.405
Well, it looks like some of you
didn't enjoy your lunch.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.115
Isn't that a pity?

33:52.115 --> 33:54.451
Do me a favor.
Clean up after yourselves now.

33:54.451 --> 33:55.786
We are moving out.

33:55.786 --> 33:57.621
Move out!

33:57.621 --> 33:59.790
Open your ears!
Moving!

33:59.790 --> 34:01.375
Move!
- Get all your things.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.793
Remember, leave only footprints.

34:02.793 --> 34:05.629
Zack, get your sandwich, please.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.293
- Howdy, sheriff.
- Ronny, how you doing?

34:44.293 --> 34:46.503
- Fine.

34:46.503 --> 34:51.175
- Budd, you get the game
on that thing?

34:51.175 --> 34:56.346
- Nah, nothing exciting happens
in this small town.

34:56.346 --> 34:57.848
What can I pour you, sheriff?

34:57.848 --> 34:59.391
- A little early, budd.

34:59.391 --> 35:02.853
- Early?
That never stopped me.

35:02.853 --> 35:05.314
- Dad.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.357
He's on duty.

35:07.357 --> 35:11.361
- I'm just trying to make
the place a little profit.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.114
- Wish you would've tried that
before you sold me this place.

35:14.114 --> 35:16.533
- Oh--

35:16.533 --> 35:18.494
- say, Mel,
didn't you have a cousin

35:18.494 --> 35:20.204
who went to that
first offenders program

35:20.204 --> 35:21.497
up there to cutter's peak?

35:21.497 --> 35:23.248
- That was a niece, yeah.

35:23.248 --> 35:26.335
It's a pretty good program.
Really helped her.

35:26.335 --> 35:29.796
- I just dropped c.B. Off
up there today.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.840
Well, there's
this female counselor up there--

35:31.840 --> 35:33.550
she seemed all right--
but what do you know

35:33.550 --> 35:36.678
about this instructor,
this sergeant hoke guy?

35:36.678 --> 35:39.556
- Abner hoke?
That guy's crazy.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.183
He ought to be in jail.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.393
He killed a kid up there
last year.

35:43.393 --> 35:44.895
- Killed a kid?
Are you serious?

35:44.895 --> 35:47.689
- Yup.
They worked him to death.

35:47.689 --> 35:51.568
- Hey, dad, can you go wait
on the other customers?

35:51.568 --> 35:53.487
- They already got fresh drinks.

35:53.487 --> 35:55.447
- Are these fucking quarters
up there?

35:55.447 --> 35:56.490
- You're fucking cheating.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.700
- Chill out.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.704
- No, I mean
the paying customers over there.

36:02.704 --> 36:04.498
- Hello.

36:04.498 --> 36:07.835
- I'm going.
I'm headed that way.

36:07.835 --> 36:12.214
Relax.
Just relax.

36:12.214 --> 36:15.259
- Is that really what happened?
- No.

36:15.259 --> 36:17.928
Look, a kid got heat stroke,

36:17.928 --> 36:19.721
but, you know,
he had a heart condition

36:19.721 --> 36:21.932
that no one knew about,
and he's okay now.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.934
I'm sure c.B. Will be fine.

36:23.934 --> 36:25.936
- Yeah.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.646
Maybe you're right.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.773
Just being a little
overprotective, I guess.

36:29.773 --> 36:33.277
- Just a little bit.

36:33.277 --> 36:36.780
- Well, thanks, Mel.
I'll see you around.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.533
- Hey, ray.

36:39.533 --> 36:42.619
Why don't you stop by
after work and have a drink?

36:42.619 --> 36:44.955
On the house.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.958
- You know, that's no way
to turn a profit.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.334
- Oh.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.812
- If you can't keep up,
I'll leave you behind.

37:10.981 --> 37:12.524
- Move out, s.T.U.M.P.S.

37:12.524 --> 37:15.402
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

38:05.702 --> 38:08.872
- Is that a Mountain lion?

38:08.872 --> 38:10.791
- I don't think so.

38:10.791 --> 38:12.417
- Mountain lions
are not my list today.

38:12.417 --> 38:13.710
Move out!

38:48.954 --> 38:51.415
- Hey!
Chicken little, give me that.

38:51.415 --> 38:52.416
That's mine.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.896
- All right, s.T.U.M.P.S,
we can soft peddle it from here.

39:13.896 --> 39:17.107
It's approximately three Miles
back to the cabin.

39:17.107 --> 39:19.860
It'll take 43 minutes,
28 seconds.

39:26.867 --> 39:30.454
- Thank you for that
very important piece of info.

39:30.454 --> 39:34.791
- And sunset will be in t-minus
42 minutes and 110 hours.

39:40.881 --> 39:44.468
- Hey, I got one.

40:14.832 --> 40:15.999
- What?

40:21.922 --> 40:23.757
- Run!

40:23.757 --> 40:25.175
Oh!

40:33.642 --> 40:35.936
- Shit.

40:35.936 --> 40:37.688
- Run! Run!

40:37.688 --> 40:39.189
Move out! Run!

40:41.108 --> 40:43.152
Move out! Move out!

41:06.091 --> 41:07.176
- Come on!

41:44.755 --> 41:46.131
Quick now!
Back to the cabin!

41:46.131 --> 41:48.008
Move, move, move, move, move!

41:48.008 --> 41:50.093
- Come on.
- Come on.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.803
Come on, let's go.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.096
Hurry up.
- Let's go.

42:04.525 --> 42:06.944
- Hey, look out.
Move, move, move, move, move.

42:08.862 --> 42:10.531
No, no, no, no, ladies,
don't stop now.

42:10.531 --> 42:12.658
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

42:12.658 --> 42:14.159
Oh!

42:14.159 --> 42:15.577
Go, go!

42:32.845 --> 42:34.304
Sam, no! No!

42:34.304 --> 42:36.265
You go get those kids
off this Mountain!

42:37.850 --> 42:40.269
Get back to the cabin!

42:40.269 --> 42:41.645
Now!

42:43.814 --> 42:45.232
Now!

42:56.952 --> 42:58.120
Hey.

42:58.120 --> 43:00.205
Hey!

43:00.205 --> 43:02.332
Yeah, you.

43:02.332 --> 43:04.918
When I get up, I swear to God,
I'll shove that ax handle

43:04.918 --> 43:07.796
so far up your ass
you're gonna shit splinters

43:07.796 --> 43:09.256
till Christmas!

43:10.841 --> 43:14.344
- What the hell was that thing?

43:14.344 --> 43:16.930
- Come on, rosa.
Come on, come on.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.807
I know you're hurt,
but we got to keep moving.

43:18.807 --> 43:20.601
Come on.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.271
- This way.
This way.

43:24.271 --> 43:25.647
Go.

43:32.362 --> 43:35.616
- Which way do we go?
- Where's sergeant hoke?

43:35.616 --> 43:36.617
- This way.
- Shit.

43:36.617 --> 43:39.203
- Go, go.

43:46.710 --> 43:47.920
- It's locked!

43:50.714 --> 43:53.217
- Look out.
Look out!

43:53.217 --> 43:54.384
Come on.
Get inside.

43:54.384 --> 43:55.761
It's still out there.
Come on.

43:55.761 --> 43:56.970
Come on!

44:02.726 --> 44:05.729
<i>- What was that thing?
- Es El demonio.</i>

44:05.729 --> 44:07.022
It's the devil.

44:20.244 --> 44:23.872
- Where's hoke?

44:23.872 --> 44:27.084
What happened to hoke?
- That thing got him; He's dead.

44:27.084 --> 44:29.336
- Well, that's just great.
That's just great.

44:29.336 --> 44:32.172
What are we gonna do now?
- We got to get out of here.

44:32.172 --> 44:35.676
- Everybody, calm down.
We'll get through this.

44:35.676 --> 44:38.178
- Okay, lady, what's the plan?

44:40.806 --> 44:43.100
- The van.

44:43.100 --> 44:45.894
We should get the van.
- Good idea.

44:45.936 --> 44:49.690
- Sergeant hoke has the keys.
- Well, that's just perfect.

44:49.690 --> 44:51.733
We can't stay here.
This is not gonna protect us.

44:51.775 --> 44:53.819
- Zack, get it together.

44:53.819 --> 44:55.154
- Who put you in charge?

44:55.154 --> 44:56.905
This isn't a therapy session.

44:59.449 --> 45:01.118
- I can hot-wire it.

45:01.118 --> 45:04.746
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

45:04.746 --> 45:07.166
- Okay, okay.

45:07.166 --> 45:09.293
C.B., find some weapons.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.308
- Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

45:47.039 --> 45:48.957
- Come on.

46:02.513 --> 46:04.515
Come on.
Come on.

46:16.902 --> 46:18.862
- Come on, come on, come on.

46:36.004 --> 46:37.172
Okay.

46:46.557 --> 46:48.934
- I don't see 'em.
Can you see 'em?

47:04.158 --> 47:05.993
- Hurry.

47:05.993 --> 47:06.994
Hurry.

47:09.997 --> 47:11.498
- It's not working.

47:14.209 --> 47:17.087
- Come on, let's go.
- I just need more time.

47:18.130 --> 47:19.965
I almost had it.

47:23.010 --> 47:24.344
- They're coming back.

47:32.978 --> 47:35.606
- What happened?
- I can't do it.

47:35.606 --> 47:37.441
I just need more time.

47:42.279 --> 47:43.906
- Oh, shit.

47:59.463 --> 48:00.923
We're screwed.

48:00.964 --> 48:02.466
That was our only way out.

48:02.466 --> 48:04.343
What are we gonna do now?

48:07.179 --> 48:09.640
I got to get out of here.
He's gonna come back.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.558
He'll come back!

49:53.744 --> 49:56.538
- Zack, let me see your hand.

49:56.580 --> 49:58.999
- You don't need to see my hand.

49:58.999 --> 50:01.752
- You're bleeding.

50:05.005 --> 50:07.007
You cut yourself.

50:31.198 --> 50:33.116
- Thank you.

50:46.672 --> 50:49.800
Door--open the door!

50:49.800 --> 50:51.218
- It's meeks.
- Let me in!

50:51.218 --> 50:52.636
- Crazy old guy?

50:52.636 --> 50:54.680
- If he's here,
then maybe the devil is gone.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.724
- Get him in.
There's a maniac out there.

50:57.724 --> 50:59.560
- Let me in!

50:59.560 --> 51:00.561
Oh.

51:09.695 --> 51:11.613
What the hell did you do?

51:11.613 --> 51:14.575
- We didn't do anything.

51:14.575 --> 51:17.161
- I'm gonna tell you something.

51:17.161 --> 51:19.163
Now, you young uns's
been messing with something

51:19.163 --> 51:20.581
you ought not have.

51:20.581 --> 51:23.125
Now, this--you brought this
on yourself!

51:23.167 --> 51:24.710
Now, I warned you.

51:24.710 --> 51:28.297
Now, what the hell did you do?
He's mad as hell.

51:28.297 --> 51:30.591
I ain't never seen him
so riled up.

51:32.593 --> 51:33.802
- Wait a second.

51:38.098 --> 51:40.184
We found this.
- Oh.

51:42.769 --> 51:45.272
This is bad.

51:45.272 --> 51:51.570
Now, this is very,
very, very bad.

52:14.134 --> 52:16.136
- So tell us
what we're up against.

52:23.602 --> 52:24.603
- Well--

52:26.855 --> 52:33.153
I guess you heard
all that nonsense about him,

52:33.153 --> 52:39.201
dragging his ax
and making the grand canyon

52:39.201 --> 52:46.500
and his footprints
making the Great Lakes.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.669
- Paul bunyan.

52:48.669 --> 52:53.465
You're telling us
that's Paul bunyan out there.

52:53.465 --> 52:58.303
- Back in late 1800s,

52:58.303 --> 53:00.514
there was a gentleman
by the name

53:00.514 --> 53:06.895
of captain larch bunyan.

53:06.937 --> 53:11.567
Now, he was a lumber baron
in these parts.

53:11.567 --> 53:14.570
He married this woman, Helga.

53:14.570 --> 53:17.406
She's new in town

53:17.406 --> 53:19.908
and ain't nobody knew
from where.

53:19.908 --> 53:24.913
Well, Helga,
she was ripe with child.

53:24.955 --> 53:26.748
Well, she gave birth

53:26.748 --> 53:32.671
to this big,
giant bodacious baby.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.798
The doctor said,

53:34.798 --> 53:39.595
"well, this child
has a rare disease

53:39.595 --> 53:43.557
or a rare blessing depending
on how you look at it.

53:43.557 --> 53:46.977
"Now, he's gonna be at least
twice as big

53:46.977 --> 53:48.937
"as a normal man

53:48.937 --> 53:52.441
"and gonna live
three times as long,

53:52.441 --> 53:58.447
but he's always gonna have
the mind of a child."

53:58.489 --> 53:59.698
Of a child.

54:03.744 --> 54:06.955
Well, by the time
he was five years old,

54:06.955 --> 54:10.375
he was six-foot-tall,
still growing.

54:10.375 --> 54:12.961
Now, young bunyan was working
the lumberyards here

54:13.003 --> 54:14.671
in this area.

54:14.671 --> 54:18.509
He was--he was bringing down
them big old oak trees

54:18.509 --> 54:21.803
with just three whacks
of that ax.

54:21.845 --> 54:24.973
Of course all the competition
and everything

54:24.973 --> 54:26.767
with the lumberjacks,
you know,

54:26.767 --> 54:30.896
he won it all at the festivals
and the fairs and whatnot,

54:30.896 --> 54:33.524
you know, hands down.

54:33.524 --> 54:36.276
Well,

54:36.276 --> 54:39.321
you see, them lumberjacks
had cut down so many trees

54:39.363 --> 54:40.989
that the food
was getting scarce.

54:41.031 --> 54:44.034
Animals were running off
to the high country.

54:44.034 --> 54:47.454
Now, at this particular camp,
this foreman bill and his men

54:47.454 --> 54:49.873
were out hunting for a meal.

54:51.834 --> 54:53.752
Well, snow come early
that year,

54:53.752 --> 54:56.547
and death was in the air.

54:56.547 --> 54:58.465
Now, the men
were following the tracks

54:58.465 --> 55:00.926
of this wounded animal
through the snow,

55:00.926 --> 55:04.721
and that's when they came upon
bunyan's beloved friend,

55:04.721 --> 55:07.349
babe the blue ox.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.434
Now, babe had wandered off
and stepped himself

55:09.434 --> 55:10.769
in a big bear trap.

55:10.769 --> 55:12.354
He was maimed, and he was weak,

55:12.354 --> 55:14.314
and he couldn't find
his way home.

55:14.314 --> 55:18.026
But the loggers, they found him.

55:18.068 --> 55:19.403
- There he is,

55:19.403 --> 55:22.447
up behind that bush.

55:22.447 --> 55:26.577
- What's he doing way up here?

55:26.577 --> 55:29.580
- He's lost.

55:29.580 --> 55:33.083
- No, he's dinner.

55:42.801 --> 55:45.345
- Oh, shit!

55:47.556 --> 55:49.057
- Back off.
I got him.

56:03.947 --> 56:06.783
- Foreman bill shot babe
right between the eyes,

56:06.783 --> 56:08.911
killed him deader
than a dinosaur.

56:08.911 --> 56:12.080
- Elmer, fire up the grill.
We're eating big tonight, buddy.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.540
- Right, boss.

56:17.836 --> 56:19.671
- Bunyan, he went out looking
for babe,

56:19.671 --> 56:22.132
and he found him.

56:23.675 --> 56:26.428
And of course, he was too late.

56:31.975 --> 56:34.645
- The loggers had roasted up
babe's carcass,

56:34.645 --> 56:39.399
and they were feasting on him
like he was a Christmas dinner.

56:50.035 --> 56:52.538
No.

56:52.538 --> 56:57.125
- So when bunyan saw what
they did to his best friend--

56:57.167 --> 57:00.879
well, the only friend
he'd ever had in whole world--

57:00.879 --> 57:02.756
well, he just went berserk.

57:02.756 --> 57:06.093
He just got that ax
and just sliced them,

57:06.093 --> 57:08.178
every damn one of them
lumberjacks.

57:19.982 --> 57:23.152
- He killed 10 if he killed 40.

57:23.193 --> 57:25.445
Whack! Whack! Whack!

57:26.488 --> 57:27.823
- Whack! Whack!

57:29.032 --> 57:30.951
- Whack!
- Die!

57:30.951 --> 57:33.495
- Whack! Whack!

57:33.537 --> 57:35.497
- No!

57:36.874 --> 57:40.836
- Whack!
Why, he just made them kindling.

57:45.883 --> 57:46.842
- Foreman bill,

57:46.884 --> 57:48.594
oh, he got the worst of it.

57:50.596 --> 57:55.184
Cut him such small pieces
that the coyotes had a hard time

57:55.225 --> 57:58.937
trying to find something
to carry away.

57:58.937 --> 58:01.023
When bunyan came to his senses,

58:01.064 --> 58:03.525
he went and hid
until the snow melted,

58:03.567 --> 58:05.194
and then he ran and he ran.

58:05.235 --> 58:08.697
But the town-folk,
they hunted him down,

58:08.697 --> 58:09.865
then caught up with him,

58:09.865 --> 58:11.575
and they chained him up,

58:11.575 --> 58:14.036
and they dragged him
through the town,

58:14.077 --> 58:17.748
back through the streets
for everybody to see.

58:21.168 --> 58:24.630
The town-folks,
they spit on him.

58:26.840 --> 58:34.097
He was humiliated, embarrassed,
red-faced.

58:34.097 --> 58:36.683
Even maybelle,
who bunyan was sweet on,

58:36.683 --> 58:39.019
she--she turned away.

58:47.986 --> 58:50.948
- They dragged him
through the forest...

58:52.616 --> 58:55.744
- Tossed bunyan
in an old mine shaft

58:55.786 --> 58:57.538
loaded with dynamite.

58:57.538 --> 58:59.915
One of them lumberjacks
lit a match.

59:01.124 --> 59:02.626
Ka-boom!

59:06.171 --> 59:10.759
Sealed that mine shaft forever.

59:10.801 --> 59:15.597
Well, then they made up
nonsense about...

59:17.099 --> 59:20.144
Paul bunyan, the lumberjack,

59:20.144 --> 59:23.230
you know, so they can keep
the prosperity going.

59:23.230 --> 59:24.815
You know?

59:24.815 --> 59:30.279
Well, memories fade.
People die.

59:30.320 --> 59:33.157
People forget.

59:33.157 --> 59:38.245
And you don't know when or who
or what happened back then.

59:40.122 --> 59:41.582
I do.

59:41.582 --> 59:43.625
I always knew.

59:43.625 --> 59:47.296
That old mine shaft,
it couldn't hold him.

59:47.337 --> 59:49.298
No, no, no, he escaped.

59:49.298 --> 59:52.301
Bunyan, he escaped.

59:52.301 --> 59:54.011
He made his way up
into the mountains,

59:54.011 --> 59:56.096
up into the high country,

59:56.096 --> 59:58.932
and he took
babe's sacred remains with him.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:00.184
And at the top of that Mountain,

01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:03.729
he made a shrine
to his only true friend.

01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:06.231
Bunyan lived there undisturbed,

01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:11.153
and he grew and he grew
bigger, bigger,

01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:13.655
alone, keeping to himself,

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.157
keeping away from civilization.

01:00:15.199 --> 01:00:17.117
He had a pretty good life
up there,

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:21.121
that is, until you went
and fouled babe's grave site.

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:24.625
You desecrated the resting place

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:28.378
of bunyan's only friend.

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:30.005
- So we're stuck here.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.382
- Hey, ain't nobody going
no place

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:37.346
until you all put babe's horn
back where it belongs.

01:00:37.387 --> 01:00:39.348
- We're not going back
out there.

01:00:39.389 --> 01:00:41.683
He'll kill us.

01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:45.729
- It's the only chance
y'all got.

01:01:00.244 --> 01:01:01.703
- No, Zack!

01:01:05.249 --> 01:01:07.084
No, Zack, come back!

01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:15.133
- Here!
Take it back!

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:16.927
This is what you want!

01:01:16.927 --> 01:01:19.054
I'm the one who took it!

01:01:19.096 --> 01:01:21.306
Take it back!

01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:23.058
And leave them alone!

01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:38.824
- Zack, get in here now!

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:46.248
- No, Zack!

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.749
No, no!

01:01:58.218 --> 01:01:59.261
- Come on.
- No!

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:00.470
- Get back.

01:02:03.473 --> 01:02:05.184
- No!

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.457
- No, please, I'm sorry.

01:02:28.499 --> 01:02:30.459
No, no, no, no.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.843
No, no, no.

01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:00.155
- What are you doing?

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:02.825
- I'm making something to eat.

01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:06.411
- I just lost another kid.

01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:11.333
- Yeah, well,
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:14.962
That boy maybe just saved
all our hides.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.346
Well, got his horn back.

01:03:24.388 --> 01:03:27.182
Let him settle.

01:03:27.224 --> 01:03:29.518
We get out of here first light.

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:48.537
- Tell my daughter I love her.

01:03:48.579 --> 01:03:52.374
- Don't say that.

01:03:52.374 --> 01:03:56.378
- I promised her
I was gonna pick her up

01:03:56.378 --> 01:03:58.922
and get her from that place

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:02.426
and I was never
gonna leave her again.

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:06.388
I promised her.

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:14.563
Marty.

01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:17.191
- You're gonna be okay.

01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:21.195
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be okay.

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.946
- Yeah.

01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:37.628
- Here.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.380
Like this.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:49.473
Guess that's the benefit
of your dad being the sheriff.

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.058
You learn things.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:57.606
I never told my dad
I loved him

01:04:57.648 --> 01:04:59.608
before he dropped me off.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.443
- He knows,

01:05:01.485 --> 01:05:04.196
and you're gonna get a chance
to tell him.

01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:07.950
- Are we gonna make it
out of here?

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:11.620
- Yeah.

01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:13.372
Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.961
- Sheriff Tanner, come in.

01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:02.129
- Yeah, go ahead, Debbie.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:03.714
- We have another bear sighting.

01:06:03.714 --> 01:06:05.424
Hiker saw it a couple days ago.

01:06:05.424 --> 01:06:08.468
Sheriff, can you swing on up
to cutter's peak?

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:10.179
- Yeah, actually,
I'm in the area.

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.222
I'll go check it out.
- In the area?

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:16.185
What are you doing way up there,
sheriff?

01:06:16.185 --> 01:06:20.189
- I'm on a sightseeing trip.
- Sightseeing?

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:21.690
- Hey, listen,
I'll be back later today.

01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:23.442
I'll go check it out.

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:25.027
Tanner out.

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:40.667
- There was a reason
why bunyan saved you

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:44.630
and split some of your friends
like two halves of a peach.

01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:49.593
You know who you are?

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:51.720
You're the spitting image
of the little lady

01:06:51.762 --> 01:06:55.265
that broke bunyan's heart.

01:06:56.642 --> 01:06:59.561
1894.

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:05.275
My great-aunt maybelle.

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:13.325
You know
what they would do to him

01:07:13.325 --> 01:07:15.244
if they found him out there.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:17.746
You know.

01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:19.748
You got a second chance.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.292
You got a second chance.

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:24.545
Don't you let him down.

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:26.296
- It's time.

01:07:30.259 --> 01:07:33.762
- I'll get the truck.

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.350
Stay right here.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.185
- Maybe we should go with you.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:41.353
- No, no, no.

01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:43.772
You stay here.
Stay here.

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:46.108
I'm safer that way.

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:48.068
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:12.259
- Oh, my God.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.822
Dispatch, this is Tanner.
Can you read me?

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:35.657
Come in.

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:37.493
Debbie, can you read?
Come on in, over.

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:41.830
Damn.

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:57.805
Dispatch, can you read?
This is Tanner.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:08:59.807
I need assistance
on the Mountain.

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.809
We need help.
I'm at the fire tower.

01:09:01.809 --> 01:09:03.185
Send backup.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:05.729
If you can read me,
send backup.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:09.608
Debbie, can you read me?

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:38.489
- Don't leave me!

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:43.827
No!

01:10:57.508 --> 01:10:58.717
- Marty.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:07.476
- Rosa!

01:11:09.269 --> 01:11:12.481
Marty! Marty!

01:11:25.494 --> 01:11:26.745
Marty!

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:39.299
Marty!

01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:54.064
- Rosa.

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:23.552
- You killed her,
you motherfucker!

01:12:24.803 --> 01:12:25.929
I'll kill you!

01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:27.848
I'll kill you, you monster!

01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:31.059
Come and get me!

01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:32.769
Come on!

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:37.065
Come on!
- No, come on.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.470
- Hey, ugly.

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:07.930
- Hmm?

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:10.098
- Dad.

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:45.843
- Yes!
Killed that motherfucker.

01:13:45.843 --> 01:13:47.636
- You okay, babe?

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:49.888
- I knew you'd come.
- All right.

01:13:49.888 --> 01:13:51.557
We got to keep moving.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.142
Those tranqs won't last long.
Let's go.

01:13:53.142 --> 01:13:54.476
C.B., give her a hand.

01:13:54.476 --> 01:13:56.478
- Come on, let's go.

01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.985
Let's go.

01:14:07.823 --> 01:14:09.741
We got to keep moving, guys.

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:11.160
- Are you okay?

01:14:11.201 --> 01:14:13.912
- Don't you understand?

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.789
He's just a boy.

01:14:15.789 --> 01:14:17.207
They want to take him away
from me,

01:14:17.207 --> 01:14:18.792
and I can't let them do that.

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:21.128
- We're getting out of here,
old man.

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:24.006
- I can't let you go.

01:14:24.006 --> 01:14:26.717
Drop that rifle, sheriff.

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:28.969
I'm gonna fill them
full of buckshot.

01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:35.517
- No!
- No, Marty, stop!

01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:40.189
- Damn.

01:14:46.111 --> 01:14:49.490
- Ah, ah, ah,
not today, sheriff.

01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:54.953
- Is it bad?
Is it bad?

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:58.665
I can't breathe.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:12.554
- Let's go.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.144
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:31.573
Sorry, maybelle...

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:38.914
But you ought not have shunned
bunyan back there in 1894.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.627
The end of the line there,
sweetie pie.

01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:45.003
- You're history, old man.

01:15:46.755 --> 01:15:49.883
- History's the only future
I got here.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.568
- We got to go.
Let's go.

01:16:07.568 --> 01:16:09.903
Come on, go, go, go!

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.710
- Truck's down this way.
Let's hurry.

01:16:31.133 --> 01:16:32.301
Get in.
Hurry.

01:16:46.023 --> 01:16:47.149
You drive.

01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:48.317
There's no time to argue.

01:16:48.358 --> 01:16:49.776
You can do it, babe.

01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:38.700
Faster! Faster!

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.785
Let's go.
Come on, go.

01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:41.954
Go, go!

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.286
- Come on, we got to go.

01:18:22.286 --> 01:18:23.412
Go!

01:18:23.453 --> 01:18:25.372
- Go, go.

01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:32.045
- Whoa!

01:18:32.045 --> 01:18:35.090
- Faster.
- I know!

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:49.855
- Hold on.

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.106
- Go left.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.252
Dad, look out!

01:19:35.859 --> 01:19:38.111
- Dad.

01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.447
Dad.

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:44.117
Are you okay?

01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:45.494
- We got to go.
Come on.

01:19:45.536 --> 01:19:48.789
Come on!

01:19:48.789 --> 01:19:49.832
- Okay, let's go.

01:19:49.832 --> 01:19:51.083
Go to the road.

01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:29.538
- Get onto the bridge.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.914
Let's head for the bridge.
Go!

01:20:50.893 --> 01:20:53.979
Faster! Faster!
Get to the door!

01:21:00.527 --> 01:21:02.571
Come on, keep going.
Keep going, let's go.

01:21:02.571 --> 01:21:04.323
We got to make it
through the door.

01:21:12.581 --> 01:21:15.334
It's locked.
- Get back.

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:44.196
- Sheriff.

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.643
- Hey, you big son of a bitch.

01:22:14.685 --> 01:22:18.188
Pick on somebody your own size.

01:22:27.281 --> 01:22:29.074
- Get him, men.
Shoot him.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.492
- Get down.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.709
- Hold your fire, men!

01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:53.742
Maybelle.

01:23:53.784 --> 01:23:56.578
Maybelle!

01:24:46.295 --> 01:24:47.796
- Are you okay?
Anyone hurt?

01:24:47.796 --> 01:24:51.133
- No, we're all okay.

01:24:51.133 --> 01:24:53.135
How'd you know where to find us?

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:55.804
- Oh, my dad picked up the call
on the scanner.

01:24:59.641 --> 01:25:01.351
- Thanks, budd.

01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:03.312
- Well, it took a little time
to gather the boys,

01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:04.438
but we got here.

01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.190
- You got here just in time.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:12.529
- Dude, did you see
my kill shot?

01:25:12.529 --> 01:25:14.823
Pow!
Right between the eyes!

01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:16.617
- No, you didn't.
That was my shot.

01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:18.619
- Bullshit, I got him.

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:20.746
- Will you listen to those guys?

01:25:20.746 --> 01:25:23.707
- Judging by the ears
and the slope of the forehead,

01:25:23.707 --> 01:25:25.501
I'd say
it was your cousin elroy!

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:26.502
- Screw you!

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.296
- It's definitely bigfoot.

01:25:29.296 --> 01:25:31.340
- No, that's sasquatch.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:34.510
- You stupid son of a bitch.
That's the same thing.

01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:37.304
- It's not bigfoot.
It's not the mothman.

01:25:37.304 --> 01:25:38.680
It's not Frankenstein.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.848
It's not the Jersey devil.

01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:41.350
That's Paul bunyan!

01:25:43.727 --> 01:25:45.896
- Hey, we could put that
in front of the bar.

01:25:45.896 --> 01:25:47.856
- No, mm-mm.
- Hey, men.

01:25:47.856 --> 01:25:50.609
Come here and give me hand
with this ax.

01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:00.410
- It's over.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.459
Come on, baby.
Let's go home.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.925

and there's legends.
