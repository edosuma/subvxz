the crazy thing.</i>

00:16.796 --> 00:19.505
<i>Invisibility is everywhere.</i>

00:19.505 --> 00:24.052
<i>I mean, sure, people tend to
focus on the things we can see.</i>

00:24.052 --> 00:27.513
<i>Like matter, living things.</i>

00:27.513 --> 00:30.516
<i>But there's also all this stuff
that we can't see.</i>

00:30.516 --> 00:33.519
<i>Like sound waves or gasses.</i>

00:33.519 --> 00:35.356
<i> And a few things we miss</i>

00:35.356 --> 00:37.522
<i> because they're hidden
in plain sight.</i>

00:39.524 --> 00:42.527
<i>Like I said,
invisibility is all around us.</i>

00:42.527 --> 00:46.532
<i> Even in the most obvious
and familiar places.</i>

00:46.532 --> 00:50.535
<i> These opposites exist
side by side.</i>

00:52.537 --> 00:54.249
<i> The seen...</i>

00:54.249 --> 00:55.667
Hey, Molly!

00:58.543 --> 01:01.546

02:05.610 --> 02:07.737
- ( music stops )
- Mr. Perkins.

02:07.737 --> 02:09.613
Fancy seeing you here.

02:09.613 --> 02:11.615
Well, I really hope
you were meditating

02:11.615 --> 02:13.744
on the marvels of science
and not rocking out

02:13.744 --> 02:15.619
to Fitz and the Tantrums again.

02:15.619 --> 02:18.622
Oh, well, actually
it is The Hives today,

02:18.622 --> 02:20.624
in honor
of those skinny jeans

02:20.624 --> 02:23.627
you are only slightly too old
to pull off.

02:25.629 --> 02:27.631
GIRL: Ah, look at that.

02:30.634 --> 02:32.636
Not so fast.

02:32.636 --> 02:35.639
Yeah, I got your pitch
for the semester project.

02:35.639 --> 02:38.642
Really? Turning a papaya
into a battery?

02:38.642 --> 02:41.645
I've already got seven other
kids turning vegetables
into batteries.

02:41.645 --> 02:43.647
In my defense,
papaya's a fruit.

02:43.647 --> 02:47.650
Mm. Well, your proposal
is officially rejected.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.653
( scoffs )
George gets all A's

02:49.653 --> 02:51.781
and you're letting him study
how a guinea pig reacts

02:51.781 --> 02:53.656
to an all-ice cream diet.

02:53.656 --> 02:55.658
- It gives them terrible gas.
- Yeah, thanks, George.

02:55.658 --> 02:57.661
Make sure you put that
in your report, okay?

02:57.661 --> 02:58.661
(guinea pig passes gas )

02:58.661 --> 02:59.663
That's it, Mr. Whiskers,

02:59.663 --> 03:01.664
no more Rocky Road for you.

03:01.664 --> 03:04.667
I want to see you challenge
yourself. Do something relevant.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.380
Maybe something to do
with transformation.

03:07.380 --> 03:11.674
This is the same matter
in two distinct forms.

03:11.674 --> 03:13.676
One state is dense, dull--

03:13.676 --> 03:14.677
Much like this conversation.

03:14.677 --> 03:17.680
The other is transparent.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.101
Brilliant. I'm assigning you
a new experiment.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.686
Figure out what that
substance is,

03:22.686 --> 03:25.688
then transform it
into its crystal state.

03:25.688 --> 03:27.691
And how am I supposed
to do that?

03:27.691 --> 03:29.692
Build a homemade
spectrometer.

03:29.692 --> 03:31.694
Yeah. You're gonna have
to do this little thing

03:31.694 --> 03:34.696
we in the science community
like call science.

03:34.696 --> 03:36.699
You think The Hives
became The Hives

03:36.699 --> 03:39.120
by shutting out the world
and listening to their
headphones all day?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.704
No. They got out there.

03:41.704 --> 03:44.707
All right, my point is you never
know what you can accomplish

03:44.707 --> 03:47.709
unless you engage the world
a little bit.

03:49.672 --> 03:50.712
And as an added incentive,

03:50.712 --> 03:53.675
I've decided as of right now,

03:53.675 --> 03:55.677
this is worth
half your class grade.

03:55.677 --> 03:57.720
- What?
- Mm-hmm. Check out
whatever gear you need.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
You've got till Monday.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.723
( scoffs )

04:02.725 --> 04:07.729
He wants me to make mystery gunk
into a crystal.

04:07.729 --> 04:09.731
That's impossible.

04:09.731 --> 04:11.733
It's not technically impossible.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.736
It's not like
"time-travel impossible,"

04:13.736 --> 04:15.737
or "speed-of-light
impossible".

04:15.737 --> 04:17.738
It's just... hard.

04:17.738 --> 04:19.576
George, why are you
wearing clown pants?

04:19.576 --> 04:21.743
These are
vintage lounge slacks.

04:21.743 --> 04:23.288
They're all the rage
in Budapest,

04:23.288 --> 04:25.040
which is the new Paris,
by the way.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.748
Girls dig these pants.

04:26.748 --> 04:29.751
At least six girls
have noticed them.

04:29.751 --> 04:30.878
Okay. One girl noticed them.

04:30.878 --> 04:34.715
And that girl was you.
Just now.

04:37.759 --> 04:40.762
( indistinct chatter )

04:41.763 --> 04:44.766
Whoa!
Nice vampire outfit, freakshow.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.061
But Halloween's
not till tomorrow.

04:47.061 --> 04:50.315
Really? "Vampire outfit?"
Is that all you got?

04:50.315 --> 04:53.317
Is it because of my cape
and my pointy teeth?

04:53.317 --> 04:55.736
Code red, code red!

04:55.736 --> 04:57.613
C-Dog approaching.
11 o'clock. Be cool!

04:57.613 --> 04:58.905
- What?
- Hey, Cleo!

05:01.075 --> 05:03.784
Carter, my man.
What's the ups?

05:03.784 --> 05:05.787
Lay the good news on me.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.795
- How's it going?
- Good.

05:14.795 --> 05:16.797
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to study together

05:16.797 --> 05:19.800
- for Perkins' next quiz?
- BOY: Who is that?

05:19.800 --> 05:22.929
- ALL: ( laugh )
- No idea.

05:24.932 --> 05:28.809
Yeah! Yeah, totally.
We could be a cliché, how fun.

05:28.809 --> 05:30.646
I'm sorry, cliché?

05:30.646 --> 05:34.233
The sports guy, asking the nerdy
girl for help with his homework.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.818
No. I just thought we could,
you know, join forces.

05:39.820 --> 05:43.824
Uh... okay. I'm going to be in
the lab for study hall tomorrow.

05:43.824 --> 05:48.829
If you have a change of heart,
stop by.

05:50.830 --> 05:53.833
Your epic crush
just asked you out on a date,

05:53.833 --> 05:55.835
and you shut him down.

05:55.835 --> 05:56.837
That wasn't a date, George.

05:56.837 --> 05:59.840
That was just a crafty jock
trying to weasel his way

05:59.840 --> 06:02.843
out of doing any actual
thinking. No thanks.

06:02.843 --> 06:05.846
I'll leave the mindless flirting
to my sister.

06:05.846 --> 06:07.848
"Awesome city! So the bomb!"

06:09.142 --> 06:10.851
MOLLY: Cleo!

06:11.851 --> 06:13.854
Speak of the devil.

06:13.854 --> 06:16.856
Hello, car full
of beautiful women.

06:16.856 --> 06:19.859
School's done.
You know what that means.

06:19.859 --> 06:22.862
Fro-yo. YOLO.
Oh, no. Let's go! Yeah!

06:22.862 --> 06:24.864
ALL: ( whooping )

06:24.864 --> 06:27.577
- You wanna come with?
- Yes!

06:27.577 --> 06:28.868
No, thanks. I'll pass.

06:28.868 --> 06:29.869
Darn.

06:29.869 --> 06:31.871
Come on.

06:31.871 --> 06:33.873
It'll be awesome city,
totally the bomb.

06:33.873 --> 06:36.001
( scoffs )
Thanks, I'll pass.

06:36.001 --> 06:39.879
It's Thursday! They're gonna
have salted caramel!

06:39.879 --> 06:41.881
Come on! Yeah.
Your buddy can come too.

06:41.881 --> 06:46.886
This is George, Coug.
You've met him 400 times.

06:46.886 --> 06:49.890
Sorry, small dude. My bad!

06:51.891 --> 06:53.310
Still a pass.

06:54.894 --> 06:56.896
Catch you later then, sis.

06:58.897 --> 07:00.900
- GIRL: All right, let's go!
- ALL: ( whooping )

07:00.900 --> 07:02.902
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

07:02.902 --> 07:04.903
I've got
the big scooter today.

07:04.903 --> 07:06.905
I made a few modifications
to it.

07:06.905 --> 07:08.909
Really souped it up.

07:13.622 --> 07:15.914
All right! Give The Coug a paw!

07:15.914 --> 07:17.209
( chuckles )

07:17.209 --> 07:18.918
Aw, yes!

07:18.918 --> 07:20.919

07:26.926 --> 07:28.927

07:34.933 --> 07:36.935
( engine dies )

07:36.935 --> 07:38.937
( engine grinding )

07:46.945 --> 07:47.946
- MAN: Honey!
- WOMAN: Yes?

07:47.946 --> 07:48.948
MAN: Did you pack my charger?!

07:48.948 --> 07:50.948
It's in your dopp kit.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.951
And I printed
the boarding passes.

07:52.951 --> 07:54.953
MAN: ( laughs )
There it is!

07:54.953 --> 07:56.955
- It was in my dopp kit!
- WOMAN: Yeah.

07:56.955 --> 07:58.956
( pulls zipper )

07:58.956 --> 08:00.959
Do they even know you're
here yet?

08:00.959 --> 08:02.961
Give them a second.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.964
Oh. Hi. We were afraid we were
going to miss you.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.967
- Hey, George.
- Hey, Cleo's Dad.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.804
I'm gonna get Whiskers
all settled in.

08:10.804 --> 08:11.969
I'll see you inside.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.972
Okay, remember,
set the alarm on at night.

08:13.972 --> 08:16.975
Don't touch the thermostats.
And there are protein shakes
if you run out of food.

08:16.975 --> 08:19.977
Honey, I am so sorry we're gonna
miss the big lacrosse game.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.980
No worries, Dad.
There'll be others.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.399
But the first game always
sets the tone for the season.

08:23.399 --> 08:25.983
- The college scouts
will be there.
- Ohh!

08:25.983 --> 08:28.986
- Just remember,
keep that stick up.
- Stay loose.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.988
Keep that middle line open and
cross if they double team you.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.990
- ( playful growl )
- BOTH: ( chuckle )

08:33.991 --> 08:35.993
And you...

08:35.993 --> 08:38.996
Stay loose, you know,
with your studies and stuff.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.000
I'll be sure to do
some rigorous stretching

08:43.000 --> 08:45.002
before I tackle my homework.

08:45.002 --> 08:48.005
- MOM: Okay.
- Okay. Bring it in, team.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.006
- One, two, three, family!
- ALL: Family!

08:49.006 --> 08:51.007
MOM: ( whoops ) Bye, girls.

08:51.007 --> 08:54.010
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

08:55.012 --> 08:58.015
- CLEO: Bye!
- MOLLY: Bye, guys!

09:02.018 --> 09:04.021
Oh, I forgot to mention,

09:04.021 --> 09:06.023
I'm having some people
over for dinner tonight.

09:06.023 --> 09:10.026
Molly, you can't. I have to
focus on my science project.

09:10.026 --> 09:11.738
Who's coming over?

09:11.738 --> 09:14.031
Just a few girls from
the lacrosse team.

09:14.031 --> 09:17.035
The whole team.
And their boyfriends.

09:17.035 --> 09:20.036
And anybody else
who wanted to come.

09:21.873 --> 09:24.041
( sighs )

09:24.041 --> 09:29.045
- ( loud music )
- ( excited chatter )

09:29.045 --> 09:31.047
ALL: ( chanting)
Hoo! Hoo! Sad but true!

09:31.047 --> 09:33.049
The Fightin' Owls
are hunting for you!

09:33.049 --> 09:35.344
Does anyone know
what goes in meatballs?

09:35.344 --> 09:39.055
- Meat, babe.
- Huh.

09:39.055 --> 09:41.057
( playful screams )

09:46.062 --> 09:48.064
( squeaks )

09:48.064 --> 09:50.066

09:54.069 --> 09:57.073
( computer beeps )

09:57.073 --> 09:58.200
( scoffs ) This is hopeless.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.077
I can't even get light
to pass through it.

10:01.077 --> 10:02.077
Did you try diluting it?

10:02.077 --> 10:04.080
- Yes.
- ( splashing in pool )

10:04.080 --> 10:08.084
I can't believe I've been exiled
out of my own house.

10:08.084 --> 10:12.087
I don't think you were exiled
so much as "gently displaced."

10:13.088 --> 10:15.050
You know what I suggest?

10:15.050 --> 10:18.093
A break. We head inside,
sample some meatballs,

10:18.093 --> 10:21.096
see if maybe one
of your sister's teammates

10:21.096 --> 10:23.098
has a penchant for shorter,
less athletic,

10:23.098 --> 10:26.101
but very intelligent, men.

10:26.101 --> 10:28.063
You should go, George.

10:28.063 --> 10:30.106
Go get some food.
I'll still be working.

10:30.106 --> 10:33.108
You're a good person.

10:33.108 --> 10:35.111

♪ Trick or treat
Feeling kinda creepy ♪

10:49.124 --> 10:52.128
I don't mean to brag, but I'm
a bit of an athlete myself.

10:52.128 --> 10:55.549
I was one of the top
lawn bowlers at math camp
last summer.

10:55.549 --> 10:58.677
You know they call lawn bowling
the "gentleman's polo".

10:58.677 --> 11:00.261
- I like horses.
- Me too!

11:00.261 --> 11:03.138
I love horses!
Love them!

11:03.138 --> 11:06.267
What are your thoughts
on guinea pigs?

11:06.267 --> 11:10.144
CLEO: Let's see what happens
if I turn up the heat.

11:10.144 --> 11:12.106
( typing on keyboard )

11:12.106 --> 11:14.149
( computer beeps )

11:14.149 --> 11:16.151
Now we're getting somewhere.

11:16.151 --> 11:18.152
Sucrose.

11:18.152 --> 11:19.280
<i>How sweet of  Señor  Perkins.</i>

11:19.280 --> 11:22.157
He gave me sugar.
( chuckles )

11:24.158 --> 11:26.160
Shoo! Get out of here.

11:49.183 --> 11:51.728
Ahh!

11:51.728 --> 11:55.024
Ahh! Oh!

12:01.195 --> 12:03.197
( grunts )

12:06.200 --> 12:08.202
Uh...

12:09.203 --> 12:10.203
Move!

12:10.203 --> 12:12.749
Damn! ( panting )

12:12.749 --> 12:14.168
( grunts )

12:14.168 --> 12:15.335
( alarm beeping )

12:15.335 --> 12:19.213
Had a little oven-temperature
misfire, but all good now!

12:27.513 --> 12:29.222
CLEO: Coming through!

12:29.222 --> 12:31.224
Excuse me
for just one second.

12:31.224 --> 12:34.227
Hey, what's going on?

12:34.227 --> 12:37.230
George, I made a moth disappear!

12:38.232 --> 12:40.233
Ooh! Ooh!

12:40.233 --> 12:43.362
- What?!
- I know this sounds impossible,
but it's true.

12:46.240 --> 12:51.244
I don't see it!
Where is it?

12:51.244 --> 12:53.246
- Do you see that?
- Uh... not really.

12:53.246 --> 12:56.249
Thanks for coming, guys.
Get some rest.

12:56.249 --> 12:59.252
We have a big day
tomorrow.

13:01.089 --> 13:02.254
No!

13:02.254 --> 13:04.257
No, no, no!

13:05.258 --> 13:07.259
No!

13:11.264 --> 13:14.267
( panting )

13:22.275 --> 13:24.277
Bye, guys.

13:30.283 --> 13:33.287
On the bright side,
the lacrosse girls dug me.

13:33.287 --> 13:35.288
I got a bunch of digits.

13:35.288 --> 13:37.289
You got no digits.

13:37.289 --> 13:39.291
I got no digits.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.293
But I did enter my number

13:41.293 --> 13:43.295
into Nikki's phone
while she wasn't looking.

13:43.295 --> 13:45.297
That's something.

13:45.297 --> 13:47.299
BOTH: ( chuckle )

13:47.299 --> 13:49.301
I made a moth invisible.

13:49.301 --> 13:52.304
You believe me, right?

13:52.304 --> 13:55.307
I believe... you probably
should get to sleep.

13:55.307 --> 13:57.436
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:15.385 --> 15:16.387
Ugh.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.423
( alarm beeping )

16:51.480 --> 16:54.484
Ahhhh!

16:54.484 --> 16:56.485
Molly?

16:56.485 --> 16:59.488
Molly, are you okay?

16:59.488 --> 17:01.490
MOLLY: Where am I?!

17:01.490 --> 17:03.492
Uh, you're in the bathroom.

17:03.492 --> 17:06.494
MOLLY: No, I'm not. I'm gone.

17:06.494 --> 17:08.497
What do you mean, you're gone?

17:16.505 --> 17:19.508
Um... Molly?

17:19.508 --> 17:21.509
- Molly, where did you go--
- MOLLY: Exactly!

17:21.509 --> 17:23.930
- ( startled gasp )
- MOLLY: Where did I go?
I don't know!

17:23.930 --> 17:26.513
I don't know where I went!

17:29.517 --> 17:30.519
- Cleo!
- Ahh!

17:30.519 --> 17:32.063
I'm not in the toilet!

17:32.063 --> 17:34.522
( whimpering )

17:34.522 --> 17:36.525
MOLLY: This is just a bad dream.

17:36.525 --> 17:39.237
Wake up, Molly! Wake up!

17:41.530 --> 17:43.824
Okay. There.

17:43.824 --> 17:46.661
Now, I'm going to
remove this towel

17:46.661 --> 17:51.539
and be awake and everything
will be totally normal.

17:52.540 --> 17:53.541
MOLLY: Ahhhh!

17:53.541 --> 17:55.543
Ahhh!

18:02.551 --> 18:04.552
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help!

18:04.552 --> 18:06.554
And what are you
going to tell them, Molly?

18:06.554 --> 18:08.556
I don't know!
That I've disappeared?

18:08.556 --> 18:11.559
I'm invisible?
I can't see myself?

18:11.559 --> 18:13.561
( sighs ) You're right.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.563
They're gonna think
I'm a crazy person.

18:15.563 --> 18:17.565
Okay. This is going
to sound insane,

18:17.565 --> 18:19.567
but I think my experiment
spread to you.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.568
What are you talking about?!

18:21.568 --> 18:23.571
I made a moth invisible
last night.

18:23.571 --> 18:26.573
- You what?!
- I was working
on a sugar solution

18:26.573 --> 18:29.576
and then I just spilled a bunch
of chemicals into the mixture

18:29.576 --> 18:32.580
and then a moth flew
through steam and it
became invisible.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.583
Did it land on you or touch
or did you swallow it?

18:35.583 --> 18:39.880
You're asking me if I swallowed
an invisible moth?

18:41.589 --> 18:43.591
Actually, there was something.

18:43.591 --> 18:46.594
Something in the bathroom
in my water.

18:46.594 --> 18:48.595
It was really weird.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.891
It was sorta bug-like. Gross.

18:51.891 --> 18:54.602
The bathroom window was open?

18:54.602 --> 18:56.603
Yeah. I think so.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.607
Okay, so what if the moth was
attracted to the light

19:00.607 --> 19:02.610
and then it flew into the room
and then fell into your water?

19:02.610 --> 19:05.612
Where I accidentally drank it?

19:05.612 --> 19:09.158
Are you kidding me?!
I accidentally drank your
invisible science project moth

19:09.158 --> 19:11.618
- and now I'm invisible too?!
- ( knocking )

19:11.618 --> 19:12.619
THE COUG: Hello?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.624
Happy Halloween, everyone!

19:17.624 --> 19:19.626
- ( stomach growls )
- Oh, man!

19:19.626 --> 19:22.629
Yo, next time The Coug says he's
gonna eat 26 meatballs,

19:22.629 --> 19:24.631
you tell him
that's too many meatballs.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.632
Oh, no. Your boyfriend's here.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.635
Oh. Hey, Cleo.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.639
Hi, Coug.
You're... a bear.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.640
Sure am. Didn't Molly tell you?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.937
We're all going as a big
Wizard of Oz team costume.

19:37.937 --> 19:39.645
I'm the Cowardly Bear.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.648
- It's a lion.
- What's a lion?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.650
The Cowardly...? Never mind.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.194
Uh, is Molly ready to roll?

19:45.194 --> 19:46.653
Um, no, she is sick.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.365
And she's in the bathroom.

19:48.365 --> 19:49.656
And you can't see her.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.658
Oh, no. Was it the meatballs?

19:51.658 --> 19:54.661
Molls? Babe?
Are you okay?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.662
MOLLY: ( muffled )
Oh, not really.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.664
Cleo's right.
I'm really sick.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.667
You're our Dorothy!
Let me take a look at you--

20:01.667 --> 20:05.671
No! I'm very contagious!
Nobody can see me.

20:05.671 --> 20:06.798
Literally.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.968
Go, Coug.
Save yourself.

20:08.968 --> 20:10.676
Quick! Go!

20:10.676 --> 20:11.803
- Quick!
- ( gasps )

20:11.803 --> 20:13.679
- Bye!
- Bye.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.681
- I guess.
- Bye.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.977
( exhales )

20:20.686 --> 20:22.688
Wow, Molly,
your boyfriend.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.691
Two words:
"Cowardly Bear."

20:25.691 --> 20:28.694
MOLLY: ( sighs ) Can we maybe
not mock my boyfriend right now

20:28.694 --> 20:30.696
and instead focus
on the crisis at hand?

20:30.696 --> 20:33.533
Okay. You're invisible.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.701
How and why are you invisible?

20:35.701 --> 20:37.702
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.704
If it spread
through your body this fast,

20:39.704 --> 20:41.707
it's extremely soluble.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.251
It should only take a few hours.

20:43.251 --> 20:45.253
A few hours?!

20:45.253 --> 20:47.712
I think. I hope.

20:47.712 --> 20:49.715
Okay, listen, Molly,
I have to get to school

20:49.715 --> 20:51.717
and figure this whole thing out.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.678
And what am I supposed to do?

20:53.678 --> 20:55.720
Just lay low. Call in sick.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.723
I can't!
I can't miss school today!

20:59.724 --> 21:02.562
Wait. It's Halloween.

21:12.737 --> 21:16.033
Really, Molly? I think your
friends can survive Halloween

21:16.033 --> 21:17.742
without Dorothy.

21:17.742 --> 21:20.745
You don't understand. Today is
the first game of the season.

21:20.745 --> 21:23.748
If I don't go to all my classes,
I can't play.

21:23.748 --> 21:26.750
This is what you're
concerned about, lacrosse?

21:26.750 --> 21:29.753
College scouts
will be at that game.

21:29.753 --> 21:32.592
This is my only chance
for them to see me.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.758
And my teammates
are counting on me.

21:34.758 --> 21:37.472
I can't let them down.

21:37.472 --> 21:38.763
I can work with this.

21:38.763 --> 21:41.766
Maybe with a little make-up
and some gloves.

21:47.731 --> 21:48.772
Cleo!

21:48.772 --> 21:51.776
The invisibility must... spread.

21:51.776 --> 21:55.739
So I anything that I touch will
gradually become invisible too?!

21:55.739 --> 21:56.781
I don't know, Molly.
Yes?

21:56.781 --> 22:01.785
So there's absolutely no way
I can un-invisible myself?

22:07.791 --> 22:11.338
- I have an idea.
- What?

22:13.797 --> 22:17.801
Yup. We're the same height,
we sound the same,

22:17.801 --> 22:19.929
we'd have the same skin tone
if you ever learn to moisturize.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.807
This could totally work.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.646
This is insane.

22:28.646 --> 22:32.816
There is no way I'm going to
pull off pretending to be you.

22:32.816 --> 22:34.817
I'll be there coaching you.

22:34.817 --> 22:37.820
( scoffs ) Come on, Molly. Even
with the hair and the makeup,

22:37.820 --> 22:40.824
I'm still me.

22:45.828 --> 22:50.543
A mask, really?
Dorothy didn't wear a mask.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.546
We're in New Orleans. Just say
you're Mardi Gras Dorothy.

22:53.546 --> 22:54.838
Mardi Gras Dorothy?

22:54.838 --> 22:57.841
Yeah. From a big
Munchkin Town parade float,

22:57.841 --> 22:59.843
with Munchkins
giving beads and stuff.

22:59.843 --> 23:04.140
Look, I've gotta
go to school today.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.849
So you've gotta get me
through this.

23:05.849 --> 23:07.850
Get your science gear

23:07.850 --> 23:10.854
and do whatever it is you
need to do to figure this out.

23:10.854 --> 23:13.274
Just please help me
get through my day

23:13.274 --> 23:15.276
until I can
be seen again, okay?

23:16.859 --> 23:18.987
Besides, you look totally cute.

23:18.987 --> 23:21.864
- Fine. Give me your car keys.
- What?

23:21.864 --> 23:23.866
Molly, you're invisible.
You can't drive.

23:23.866 --> 23:27.870
Well, you can't drive either.
You don't have a license!

23:34.711 --> 23:36.879
( car engine starts )

23:38.881 --> 23:42.010
This is crazy.
What if we get pulled over?
How do we explain this?

23:42.010 --> 23:44.887
MOLLY: Relax.
It's going to be fine.

23:45.887 --> 23:49.892
Sorry. Just talking
to my invisible sister.

23:50.892 --> 23:53.730
She's a really amazing driver.

23:56.899 --> 23:58.900
MOLLY: See? She probably thought

23:58.900 --> 24:00.904
this was one of those
self-driving cars.

24:02.905 --> 24:04.906
( boat blows horn )

24:04.906 --> 24:06.908
( up-tempo pop song )

24:06.908 --> 24:11.913
♪ If you could see
inside of me ♪

24:15.917 --> 24:19.921
♪ Everything that I could be ♪

24:19.921 --> 24:21.923
♪ Yeah ♪

24:21.923 --> 24:23.925
This is never going to work.

24:23.925 --> 24:26.928
Dorothy should've made
better life choices.

24:26.928 --> 24:28.930
"Oh, there's a tornado coming.

24:28.930 --> 24:31.933
I'm gonna go
put on my party clothes."

24:31.933 --> 24:33.935
Come on, you'll be fine.

24:33.935 --> 24:36.063
( grunts )

24:40.942 --> 24:42.943
Don't walk like you.
Walk like me. Stand up straight.

24:42.943 --> 24:45.946
Look more cheerful. Wave.

24:48.949 --> 24:49.951
- GIRL 1: Hi, molly.
- GIRL 2: Hey, Molly.

24:49.951 --> 24:51.953
- GIRL 3: Hey, Molly.
- MOLLY: See?

24:51.953 --> 24:53.954
- This is totally working.
- GROUP: Hi, Molly!

24:53.954 --> 24:57.959
Okay, here's the real test. If
Nikki buys this, everyone will.

24:57.959 --> 24:59.961
Okay, act natural.

24:59.961 --> 25:02.964
But... act like me.

25:02.964 --> 25:06.384
Act like natural me.

25:06.384 --> 25:08.512
Molly?

25:08.512 --> 25:09.970
Yes.

25:11.972 --> 25:14.975
Oh, Molls! I'm so glad you're
here! I thought you were sick.

25:14.975 --> 25:16.977
Uh, yeah,

25:16.977 --> 25:18.814
- I am still very sick.
- Oh.

25:18.814 --> 25:20.399
But I'm a bit better

25:20.399 --> 25:22.983
and I'm still quite pale
and my voice is a bit different.

25:22.983 --> 25:24.985
But, you know, Nikki,
it's okay.

25:24.985 --> 25:26.530
Awesome city, right?

25:26.530 --> 25:27.988
I love the mask.

25:27.988 --> 25:29.115
The mask. Uh, right.

25:29.115 --> 25:30.991
Well, I am
Mardi Gras Dorothy.

25:30.991 --> 25:32.993
Hmm, cute.

25:32.993 --> 25:34.995
Molls, I'm totally freaking out.

25:34.995 --> 25:36.997
Arianna Burmeister is
also out sick,

25:36.997 --> 25:39.834
so that means
I'm totally in charge
of Romp the Swamp tonight.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.003
And I don't know what to do or
if we have enough decorations.

25:42.003 --> 25:45.005
Please, just tell me
everything's gonna be okay.

25:45.005 --> 25:47.007
That actually
sounds awful Nikki,

25:47.007 --> 25:49.009
but I would just cancel.

25:49.009 --> 25:51.010
- ( gasps )
- Are you okay?

25:51.010 --> 25:53.013
Uh, I am fine. I just have a
little neck twitch this morning,

25:53.013 --> 25:55.015
- but it is okay.
- (laughs softly )

25:55.015 --> 25:59.018
Molls, you're here.
But I thought you were sick.

25:59.018 --> 26:02.021
- She got better.
- Hey, that's great!

26:02.021 --> 26:04.023
- Give the Coug some sugar.
- No. No, that is eww.

26:04.023 --> 26:07.026
Um, I am very contagious.
So I will see you around. Bye.

26:07.026 --> 26:09.322
Molls?
Did I do something wrong?

26:09.322 --> 26:14.034
Um, no, no.
It's-It's my disease.

26:18.331 --> 26:20.039
( cell phone rings )

26:21.459 --> 26:23.042
Hey, George.

26:23.042 --> 26:24.043
<i> GEORGE: You're not at school?</i>

26:24.043 --> 26:26.756
No. I'm-I'm really sick.

26:26.756 --> 26:28.047
Your sister's here.

26:28.047 --> 26:32.051
She's like some freaky carnival
milkmaid Zorro.

26:32.051 --> 26:33.052
Hey, Molly!

26:35.054 --> 26:38.600
Uh, yeah. Yep.
She is Mardi Gras Dorothy.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.060
She looks totally smokin'.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.062
What? Eww. ( scoffs )

26:43.062 --> 26:46.064
George, can you please
just cover for me today
in Perkins' class?

26:46.064 --> 26:48.067
You got it.

26:48.067 --> 26:51.069
CLEO: All right, Molly, we have
to go get to the lab.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.072
No. First period is starting.

26:53.072 --> 26:55.074
I can't be late.

26:55.074 --> 26:58.495
And what class is it, Molly?
Intro to Conformity?

26:58.495 --> 27:02.791
Intro to Geometry, room 42.
Come on.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.088
C-minus?

27:13.091 --> 27:17.095
Molly, if you needed help
with line segments,
you could've just asked.

27:17.095 --> 27:20.098
Right, because
you're always so...

27:22.101 --> 27:23.395
warm and supportive.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.107
Okay. I have to go
get to study hall

27:29.107 --> 27:31.109
so I can get a big
compound microscope

27:31.109 --> 27:33.111
so I can figure
this whole thing out.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.113
Actually,
I'll grab it for you.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.115
You have to get
to Pep Circle.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.117
Pep what?

27:40.118 --> 27:41.119
( awkward laugh )

27:41.119 --> 27:43.121
BOTH: (laugh softly)

27:43.121 --> 27:45.124
That was weird.

27:45.124 --> 27:47.125
A thing we do on game days.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.127
Just bonding and trust-building.

27:49.127 --> 27:51.128
It's a pre-game ritual...

27:52.130 --> 27:54.550
that you are leading.

27:54.550 --> 27:57.134
- ( applause )
- (cheers )

27:57.134 --> 27:59.136
ALL: ( chanting ) Trust!
Teamwork! Fellowship! Pride!

27:59.136 --> 28:02.139
A team united can't be denied!
Whoo!

28:02.139 --> 28:04.142
Who puts the pep
in Pep Circle?

28:04.142 --> 28:06.144
ALL: We do!

28:06.144 --> 28:07.144
Please don't make me do this.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.147
Molly! You made it!

28:09.147 --> 28:11.149
ALL: Molly!

28:11.149 --> 28:13.150
I've warmed us up. We're totally
ready for you to take over.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.153
Oh, well, that's just great.

28:16.153 --> 28:19.157
Um, so let's just go straight
into the first thing then

28:19.157 --> 28:23.160
- which is the...
- Group hug!

28:23.160 --> 28:25.162
Or we can skip the first thing!
Okay...

28:25.162 --> 28:26.707
Oh. Oh. ( grunts )

28:26.707 --> 28:28.165
Next thing on the agenda.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.168
The circle of trust.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.169
Right.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.172
So let's circle up
and do some trust.

28:37.467 --> 28:38.468
NIKKI: You can have the bunny.

28:38.468 --> 28:40.177
The bunny?

28:40.177 --> 28:42.179
The bunny of truth.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.181
Well, the bunny of truth.

28:44.181 --> 28:48.185
Um, Nikki, could you
please remind us all

28:48.185 --> 28:50.187
what the rules are
of truth bunnying?

28:50.187 --> 28:52.189
Whoever holds the bunny
gets to safely say

28:52.189 --> 28:56.193
something true and meaningful to
clear the air before the game.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.195
( soft laugh )

28:58.195 --> 29:00.197
Well, then Nikki
should start us off.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.198
Oh, okay.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.200
Um...

29:03.200 --> 29:06.203
Okay, I'm so grateful
to be on a team with all of you.

29:06.203 --> 29:11.208
If I am strong, it's only
because I'm surrounded
by such strong women.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.209
And I'm especially grateful
for Molls.

29:13.209 --> 29:17.214
She's always there. No matter
how crazy my life gets,

29:17.214 --> 29:19.216
she gives me the friendship
and support I need.

29:19.216 --> 29:23.054
She's an amazing friend
and captain.

29:23.054 --> 29:25.221
- ALL: Yeah!
- Thank you.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.641
I also want to say one more
quick bunny truth,

29:27.641 --> 29:31.227
and that is that
I'm really mad at the people
who invented weather apps

29:31.227 --> 29:33.229
because don't you wanna wake up
every morning

29:33.229 --> 29:35.232
and be surprised
at what the weather is?!

29:35.232 --> 29:38.235
ALL: ( laugh ) Yeah.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.236
Your turn.

29:41.237 --> 29:44.240
Well, my truth is

29:44.240 --> 29:46.241
that I am so grateful
to be sitting down

29:46.241 --> 29:50.246
because this dress
is a serious chaffing hazard.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.247
ALL: ( murmur )

29:51.247 --> 29:56.252
Okay. Now for your...
emotional truth.

29:59.254 --> 30:03.259
My emotional truth. That would
probably have to be that

30:03.259 --> 30:06.262
I am fine. I am great.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.264
Thank you, Nikki.

30:08.264 --> 30:11.267
Molly, this is your safe place.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.268
You can trust us.
We love you.

30:13.268 --> 30:16.271
ALL: ( agreeing )

30:29.284 --> 30:33.288
My truth would be...

30:35.290 --> 30:38.294
I'm not the girl that

30:38.294 --> 30:41.296
everybody thinks I am.

30:41.296 --> 30:45.135
I'm not
the beautiful shining star

30:45.135 --> 30:48.303
that everybody suspects.

30:51.306 --> 30:55.310
I'm actually more of the person

30:55.310 --> 30:58.313
that nobody notices,

30:58.313 --> 31:00.315
or nobody pays attention to.

31:02.316 --> 31:03.318
But...

31:06.321 --> 31:09.324
this is probably why
I'm so uncomfortable here.

31:09.324 --> 31:11.326
( uncomfortable laugh )

31:12.327 --> 31:13.621
But, guys,

31:13.621 --> 31:16.331
this is- this is all in my head.

31:16.331 --> 31:18.332
Right?
Because I'm awesome city Molly.

31:18.332 --> 31:21.295
I mean, the bomb.

31:21.295 --> 31:23.337
Anyway, that's my truth,

31:23.337 --> 31:28.342
which is actually,
weirdly, true.

31:30.345 --> 31:33.348
( indistinct chatter )

31:33.348 --> 31:35.309
( door opens )

31:39.313 --> 31:40.354
I think that deserves
another group hug!

31:40.354 --> 31:42.356
Um, okay.

31:42.356 --> 31:45.359
All right. Yep, yep.
Love you too, okay.

31:46.361 --> 31:48.363
( squeaks, then passes gas )

32:00.374 --> 32:02.375
GEORGE: Carter. My hombre.

32:02.375 --> 32:05.378
- How's the guinea pig?
- Still farting like a chainsaw.

32:05.378 --> 32:07.090
I can't figure out why.

32:07.090 --> 32:09.383
Because there's talmitic acid
in the ice cream.

32:09.383 --> 32:11.677
It's reacting with ascorbic acid
and turning it into a fat.

32:11.677 --> 32:14.388
Ascorbyl palmitate. They can't
metabolize the fat,

32:14.388 --> 32:18.351
- so you end up
with the flatulence.
- How'd you know that?

32:18.351 --> 32:20.394
I was a Governor's Scholar
in Chemistry last year.

32:20.394 --> 32:22.396
GEORGE: Really? A Governor's
Scholar in Chemistry?

32:22.396 --> 32:26.399
- That's, like, crazy amazing.
- How about
we keep it between us?

32:26.399 --> 32:28.401
You know, it's not
really something
I like to advertise.

32:28.401 --> 32:30.404
Hey. Do you know if Cleo was
planning on showing up?

32:30.404 --> 32:34.242
I'm sorry, man.
She's actually sick today.

32:34.242 --> 32:37.410
But I know she might've
maybe wanted to be here, maybe.

32:39.413 --> 32:44.417
Can I ask you something?
What's Cleo's deal?

32:44.417 --> 32:46.420
Whenever I talk to her,
it's like,

32:46.420 --> 32:49.965
you know...
and she's kind of...

32:52.260 --> 32:56.429
Never mind. It's cool. Uh,
good luck with the guinea pig.

33:24.582 --> 33:27.460
( indistinct chatter and sighs )

33:30.463 --> 33:33.466
This is actually amazing.

33:33.466 --> 33:35.303
Oh! Okay!

33:35.303 --> 33:37.469
- Gotta go, guys. Bye.
- GIRL: Molly?

33:37.469 --> 33:39.471
ALL: ( murmuring )

33:40.472 --> 33:42.893
What are you doing?
Did you get the microscope?

33:42.893 --> 33:45.477
Forget about that!
Some really cute guy

33:45.477 --> 33:46.479
in the science lab
was asking for you!

33:46.479 --> 33:48.480
Oh, that's just Carter.

33:48.480 --> 33:53.194
"Just Carter?" He's super cute
and totally into you!

33:53.194 --> 33:56.488
No, Molly.

33:56.488 --> 33:58.909
I'm not the kind of girl that...

33:58.909 --> 34:02.493
guys like Carter
are ever actually into.

34:03.495 --> 34:04.496
Come on.

34:04.496 --> 34:06.498
There's only one way
to find out.

34:06.498 --> 34:08.500
No. Don't you think
we have bigger things

34:08.500 --> 34:10.045
to worry about right now?

34:10.045 --> 34:12.504
I'm not going
to go meet Carter, okay?

34:12.504 --> 34:13.504
That's final.
Now if you'll excuse me,

34:13.504 --> 34:16.507
I have
a massage circle to lead.

34:17.509 --> 34:20.512
Aah! Meatballs! Meatballs!

34:20.512 --> 34:22.514
- ( stomach gurgles loudly )
- Ohh, coming through!

34:22.514 --> 34:25.516
Coming through!

34:30.522 --> 34:33.485
Coming through! Mayday!
Meatballs!

34:33.485 --> 34:35.362
- ( gurgling continues )
- Lots of meatballs!

34:35.362 --> 34:39.531
( grunting ) Why did I eat
so many meatballs?!

34:42.533 --> 34:44.829
Watch my fur, dudes.

34:44.829 --> 34:47.538
( stall door shuts )

34:51.542 --> 34:52.543
( exhales )

34:52.543 --> 34:53.543
Here goes nothing.

34:55.545 --> 34:56.547
You can do this, Molly.

34:56.547 --> 35:00.551
Just hold your breath,
get in and get out.

35:00.551 --> 35:02.552
Gross.

35:02.552 --> 35:04.555
Uh... is there a chick in here?

35:04.555 --> 35:09.560
MOLLY: ( deep voice ) No.
It's me, a dude.

35:09.560 --> 35:12.397
In the stall.
Doing my dude things.

35:12.397 --> 35:15.400
- Mmm.
- ( door closes )

35:17.568 --> 35:21.114
- MOLLY: Carter!
- Uh, yes?

35:21.114 --> 35:23.573
It's me! Cleo!

35:23.573 --> 35:24.993
- Sorry, who? You're--
- I'm Cleo!

35:24.993 --> 35:28.997
- Cleo! You showed?
- Yep! Sure did!

35:28.997 --> 35:33.584
- I thought you were---
- MOLLY: Sick? Yes. I was.

35:33.584 --> 35:35.878
But now I'm
feeling much better.

35:35.878 --> 35:39.589
And you're in costume.
You hate costumes.

35:39.589 --> 35:43.593
Yeah, I know,
but I'm working
on this thing

35:43.593 --> 35:47.597
where I'm trying to relax more
and be less judgmental
and uptight.

35:47.597 --> 35:49.434
GEORGE: Are you sure
you're okay?

35:49.434 --> 35:50.600
You don't really
seem like yourself.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.602
Those pants
look ridiculous on you.

35:52.602 --> 35:55.315
There's the Cleo
I know and love.

35:55.315 --> 36:00.610
So, hi. We're hanging out.

36:00.610 --> 36:02.612
Yeah, I guess we are.

36:02.612 --> 36:04.614
This is great.
I'm really psyched.

36:04.614 --> 36:07.617
- You are?
- I know.

36:07.617 --> 36:09.619
I've probably been
confusing in the past.

36:09.619 --> 36:12.622
A little grouchy, right?
Mean, even.

36:12.622 --> 36:14.624
But let's just
put all that behind us.

36:14.624 --> 36:17.627
Focus on the now.
Maybe get to know each other.

36:17.627 --> 36:19.629
Tell me about yourself.

36:19.629 --> 36:22.632
What kind of stuff
does Carter groove to?

36:22.632 --> 36:24.634
( gasps ) Oh, no.

36:24.634 --> 36:28.638
Oh. Uh...
Actually, I have to run.

36:28.638 --> 36:33.185
But maybe we could
go out sometime,
like in a non-study setting.

36:33.185 --> 36:34.643
Like a real date.

36:34.643 --> 36:36.646
Wait a second, I--

36:36.646 --> 36:39.648
I'm not sure I'm hearing you
correctly in that suit.

36:39.648 --> 36:40.649
Are you asking me out?

36:40.649 --> 36:43.652
Yeah. I am.
What? Is that weird?

36:43.652 --> 36:46.656
Honestly, coming from you,
a little.

36:46.656 --> 36:49.659
- A lot, actually.
- What are you doing tonight?

36:49.659 --> 36:52.661
Tonight? Um, I'm volunteering
at the school fundraiser.

36:52.661 --> 36:55.664
Romp the Swamp? That's
my favorite event of the year!

36:55.664 --> 36:58.667
I'll see you there tonight.
It's a date.

37:02.671 --> 37:05.674
- BOTH: ( grunt )
- Coug!
Watch where you're going!

37:05.674 --> 37:08.220
It's not The Coug!

37:09.678 --> 37:11.680
Molly? What are you doing?

37:11.680 --> 37:14.683
So, you didn't miss your study
date with Carter after all.

37:14.683 --> 37:16.978
- What?
- I figured out a way
to pretend to be you.

37:16.978 --> 37:19.688
- You what?!
- Yeah.

37:19.688 --> 37:21.689
The bear costume
was thick enough,
so it didn't turn invisible.

37:21.689 --> 37:23.692
Well, at least,
not right away.

37:23.692 --> 37:25.694
Anyways,
I got you a real date.

37:25.694 --> 37:28.239
He's working
at Romp the Swamp tonight.

37:28.239 --> 37:29.697
At least,
I think it's a date.

37:31.699 --> 37:33.995
Honestly, it was
a little hard to communicate,

37:33.995 --> 37:35.704
being in the bear suit.

37:37.831 --> 37:41.710
Oh my!
Bear. With no head.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.254
- Headless bear.
- Oh, no.

37:43.254 --> 37:44.712
Molly? What's happening?

37:44.712 --> 37:46.715
I'm Cleo.

37:46.715 --> 37:47.715
No. You're Molly.

37:47.715 --> 37:48.716
No. That's Molly.

37:48.716 --> 37:51.137
No. That's a headless bear.

37:51.137 --> 37:53.681
Or an armless bear?

37:53.681 --> 37:54.723
Torso-less bear?

37:54.723 --> 37:57.726
Okay, I'm kind of
losing my mind right now.

37:57.726 --> 38:00.020
George, calm down.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.273
Remember how I made a moth
invisible last night?

38:02.273 --> 38:04.733
- Yeah.
- CLEO: Well, it flew
into Molly's drink

38:04.733 --> 38:08.571
and now she's invisible.

38:08.571 --> 38:10.738
- Say something.
- MOLLY: Hi, George.

38:10.738 --> 38:12.740
How are you?

38:12.740 --> 38:14.868
Fine. Are you okay, Molly?

38:14.868 --> 38:16.744
MOLLY: I'm good.

38:17.746 --> 38:20.748
This is amazing.

38:20.748 --> 38:21.748
And very scary.

38:21.748 --> 38:23.751
THE COUG: Who stole
my bear costume?

38:23.751 --> 38:25.045
MOLLY: Oh, gotta hide!

38:26.753 --> 38:29.756
Molly! Wow, you are
a sight for sore eyes.

38:29.756 --> 38:32.595
- Oh, hey, little guy.
- George.

38:32.595 --> 38:35.763
Of course.
Someone stole my bear costume.

38:35.763 --> 38:38.601
Just right out of the bathroom.
Any of you guys seen it?

38:38.601 --> 38:40.767
Um, no. Nope, Coug.
I haven't seen a thing.

38:40.767 --> 38:43.771
But it was so great
talking to you. Awesome city.

38:43.771 --> 38:45.772
Um, I have to leave.

38:45.772 --> 38:47.774
( stammers )

38:52.779 --> 38:56.783
So do you think, in exchange for
me being cool and keeping all
this a secret,

38:56.783 --> 38:58.785
you might put in a good word
for me with your friend Nikki?

38:58.785 --> 39:02.332
MOLLY: You like Nikki?!
That's so adorable!

39:02.332 --> 39:04.791
Nikki's a sweetheart.
She likes nice guys.

39:04.791 --> 39:07.504
Just be yourself around her.

39:07.504 --> 39:10.757
Yeah, I find the whole
"being myself" approach

39:10.757 --> 39:11.798
never really works out for me.

39:11.798 --> 39:14.801
Just give her a chance.
She might surprise you.

39:19.806 --> 39:21.807
Molly Eastman?

39:22.809 --> 39:26.647
- Yep, that's me.
- Yeah, I'm Mr. Perkins.

39:26.647 --> 39:27.814
Your sister's
in my science class.

39:27.814 --> 39:30.817
Oh. Well, I have
heard a lot about you.

39:30.817 --> 39:33.112
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

39:33.112 --> 39:34.820
Sure.

39:34.820 --> 39:38.242
Yeah, uh, listen, I know your
sister stayed home sick today.

39:38.242 --> 39:41.828
Yeah, she's really,
really sick, Mr. Perkins.

39:41.828 --> 39:44.831
- She has to stay home.
- Yeah. The, uh, thing is,

39:44.831 --> 39:47.833
I went all angry teacher
on her yesterday

39:47.833 --> 39:49.836
and I told her, well,
she'd fail my class

39:49.836 --> 39:51.837
if she didn't deliver
on her science project.

39:51.837 --> 39:54.841
I just want to make sure
that she's okay.

39:54.841 --> 39:57.844
That the science project isn't
the reason she's staying home.

39:58.844 --> 40:00.846
She's okay. Yeah.

40:00.846 --> 40:03.975
She is actually doing a lot more
than you expected.

40:03.975 --> 40:05.852
A lot more.

40:05.852 --> 40:07.853
I'm pretty sure she's gonna
blow you mind.

40:07.853 --> 40:09.855
Okay, that is great to hear.
See, I knew she had it in her.

40:09.855 --> 40:12.858
- Thanks.
- Your sister is one of
the brightest kids

40:12.858 --> 40:15.987
that's ever sat in my class.
She's got this potential
inside her.

40:15.987 --> 40:19.865
You know, I think she could do
great things in this world
if she wanted to.

40:19.865 --> 40:22.868
If she would just get out
of her own way.

40:23.869 --> 40:25.871
Yeah.

40:25.871 --> 40:28.874
Um, if she were here,

40:28.874 --> 40:31.877
she would want me
to tell you that

40:31.877 --> 40:34.879
She really doesn't want
to disappoint you.

40:34.879 --> 40:37.882
Well,
tell her to feel better.

40:37.882 --> 40:39.884
It was good
talking to you.

40:45.890 --> 40:46.892
Come on.

40:51.732 --> 40:53.898
- ( gasps ) Yes!
- ( bell rings )

40:53.898 --> 40:56.901
- ( up-tempo pop song plays )
- ( excited chatter )

41:00.615 --> 41:03.908
MOLLY: Cleo, shouldn't I
have at least started
turning visible by now?

41:04.909 --> 41:06.911
CLEO: ( sighs ) Yes.

41:06.911 --> 41:07.913
Which is exactly why
we need to go home

41:07.913 --> 41:09.915
so we can figure
this whole thing out.

41:09.915 --> 41:13.918
MOLLY: Wait.
We're not going home now.

41:13.918 --> 41:15.920
But school's over.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.922
MOLLY: And the most important
part of the day is starting.

41:16.922 --> 41:19.924
- Which is?
- MOLLY: Lacrosse.

41:19.924 --> 41:22.927
Making me visible
is gonna have to wait.

41:22.927 --> 41:24.929
I... ( groans )

41:24.929 --> 41:27.932
<i>- ALL: ( cheering )

<i>Don't forget to buy your
Go Fighting Owls T-shirts.</i>

41:31.937 --> 41:33.938
I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

41:33.938 --> 41:35.940
- I don't think so.
- Molly, I cannot do this.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.941
I am going
to get creamed out there.

41:37.941 --> 41:38.943
You'll be fine.

41:38.943 --> 41:40.944
That's easy
for you to say.

41:40.944 --> 41:42.946
What? You think
this is easy for me?

41:42.946 --> 41:44.950
I'm terrified every game.

41:44.950 --> 41:47.951
I can hardly sleep
the night before.

41:47.951 --> 41:49.954
I have to drink ginger fizz
just to untie the knots
in my stomach.

41:49.954 --> 41:52.957
Well, then why do you do it?

41:52.957 --> 41:56.960
Well...
I like being on a team.

41:56.960 --> 42:00.964
When everyone's around me,
my nerves settle.
I don't feel alone.

42:00.964 --> 42:05.094
It's like, when I'm part of
something bigger than myself,

42:05.094 --> 42:08.682
- it makes me better.
- Hmm.

42:14.978 --> 42:17.981
Hey. You can do this.

42:17.981 --> 42:20.984
I'll be there with you,
telling you exactly what to do.

42:20.984 --> 42:23.987
( panting ) You ready to rumble,
Molls?

42:23.987 --> 42:24.988
We've gotta rock it,
today.

42:24.988 --> 42:26.408
Uh, yeah, rock it!

42:26.408 --> 42:27.992
Totally.

42:27.992 --> 42:29.992
Okay, bring it in! Bring it in!

42:29.992 --> 42:30.995
WOMAN: Bring it in, ladies!

42:30.995 --> 42:33.997
All right, everyone.
Go Fighting Owls!

42:40.004 --> 42:43.005

you've all been waiting for.</i>

42:43.005 --> 42:45.008
<i> It's game time!</i>

42:45.008 --> 42:49.011
ALL: ( chanting ) Owls!
Owls! Owls! Owls!

42:50.014 --> 42:52.015
MOLLY: Your stick's upside down.

42:52.015 --> 42:54.016
Duly noted.

43:00.983 --> 43:02.024
Molly, move up!

43:04.026 --> 43:05.571
You're running the wrong way!

43:08.030 --> 43:09.031
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on!

43:09.031 --> 43:10.032
Yes!

<i>Wow, slow and painful start
for the Fighting Owls.</i>

43:33.055 --> 43:35.058
<i> - Let's see
if they can recover.
- It's okay, it's okay.</i>

43:35.058 --> 43:38.059
Should somebody
call an ambulance?

43:40.062 --> 43:42.064
( panting ) You okay?

43:42.064 --> 43:46.067
That hurt more than anything
in my entire life has hurt.

43:46.067 --> 43:50.072
- All right, come on. Get up.
- Sure, just let me try
and start breathing first.

43:52.784 --> 43:55.077
Molly, what's wrong
with you? It's like you've never
held a stick before!

43:55.077 --> 43:57.078
Uh, it must just be my cold.

43:57.078 --> 43:59.080
( coughs )

43:59.080 --> 44:01.042
Hey, listen to me.

44:01.042 --> 44:02.377
This is my whole life, here.

44:02.377 --> 44:05.086
Those college scouts are
my future. I can't lose today.

44:05.086 --> 44:08.089
( up-tempo pop song plays )

44:08.089 --> 44:11.093
I've got an idea.

44:11.093 --> 44:13.930

46:12.211 --> 46:13.212
Refreshment?

46:13.212 --> 46:15.214
Thanks.

46:15.214 --> 46:18.217
You know, there's some
really complicated physics
in lacrosse.

46:18.217 --> 46:21.220
I'm available for
a one-on-one consultation
anytime.

46:23.222 --> 46:25.224
What makes this drink
so blue?

46:25.224 --> 46:28.937
Huh, you got me there.

46:28.937 --> 46:30.230
( panting )

46:34.233 --> 46:35.234
How you doing?

46:35.234 --> 46:37.236
I can't play.
I just can't.

46:37.236 --> 46:38.780
I can't even feel
my legs.

46:38.780 --> 46:41.240
Please, Cleo, this is it--
all or nothing.

46:44.243 --> 46:46.244
MOLLY:
See over there?

46:46.244 --> 46:47.246
This is my future, Cleo.

46:51.249 --> 46:52.252
I need this.

46:54.252 --> 46:56.255
All right, guys,
everybody bring it in.

46:56.255 --> 46:57.255
Uh, good luck.

46:57.255 --> 47:00.259
Thanks, thanks.
Okay, bye.

47:02.260 --> 47:05.263
Okay, guys, I know
you are exhausted.

47:05.263 --> 47:08.102
I'm exhausted
and in pain.

47:08.102 --> 47:09.268
A lot of pain.

47:09.268 --> 47:11.270
<i>And I mean a  lot
of pain.</i>

47:11.270 --> 47:12.271
( laughter )

47:12.271 --> 47:16.275
But there is this thing
I always say,

47:16.275 --> 47:19.277
which is when you're part
of something

47:19.277 --> 47:22.281
bigger than yourself,
it makes you better.

47:22.281 --> 47:24.826
That's what
a team means.

47:24.826 --> 47:28.705
So let's get out there
and have each others'
backs, okay?

47:28.705 --> 47:30.581
ALL: Yeah!

47:30.581 --> 47:32.290
You guys,
we can do this.

47:32.290 --> 47:34.292
- Right?
- ALL: Yeah!

47:34.292 --> 47:36.294
All right, all in.

47:36.294 --> 47:39.297
- One, two, three...
- ALL: Owls!

47:41.299 --> 47:43.301
Nice job.

47:43.301 --> 47:45.303
I don't know how
you do this every week.

47:47.305 --> 47:50.308
<i>ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):

47:50.308 --> 47:52.436

<i> Time for one more play.</i>

48:09.327 --> 48:12.329
I can't get to the goal, Cleo.

Go, Molly!

48:20.337 --> 48:23.341
CROWD: Molly! Molly! Molly...

48:26.343 --> 48:29.346

49:10.930 --> 49:15.391
CROWD:
Molly! Molly! Molly...

49:32.408 --> 49:33.410
CLEO:
Hold the slide steady
so I can figure out

49:33.410 --> 49:35.411
what's going on
with your cells.

49:38.414 --> 49:43.712
Okay, getting focused here.

49:43.712 --> 49:45.421
There's a nuclear membrane.

49:45.421 --> 49:48.424
- Wait.
- MOLLY: Wait what?

49:48.424 --> 49:50.426
Is that a good wait
or a bad wait?

49:50.426 --> 49:51.427
Your body, your cells,

49:51.427 --> 49:53.555
they aren't metabolizing
the compound.

49:53.555 --> 49:55.431
That sounds like
a bad wait.

49:55.431 --> 49:57.432
Why is this even happening?

49:57.432 --> 49:59.435
The original sugar
solution

49:59.435 --> 50:00.979
must be turning
into a fat

50:00.979 --> 50:01.981
and getting stuck
in her cells.

50:01.981 --> 50:03.439
So what does that mean?

50:03.439 --> 50:05.440
We have to figure out how
to neutralize the solution

50:05.440 --> 50:07.442
before her body could
fully absorb it, or--

50:07.442 --> 50:09.863
Or the invisibility will
become permanent.

50:09.863 --> 50:12.448
What?

50:12.448 --> 50:14.450
I thought you said
this was temporary.

50:14.450 --> 50:17.453
It takes the human body
24 hours to fully digest
something.

50:17.453 --> 50:18.453
Right.

50:18.453 --> 50:19.455
Okay, so when did you
swallow the moth?

50:19.455 --> 50:21.456
Last night at midnight.

50:21.456 --> 50:24.459
GEORGE: That means we have
until midnight to find
an antidote.

50:24.459 --> 50:26.461
Or she becomes
invisible forever.

50:26.461 --> 50:28.463
But where do we start?

50:28.463 --> 50:30.466
I don't even remember
what I spilled

50:30.466 --> 50:31.466
into the last solution.

50:31.466 --> 50:33.469
So that's what
we do first.

50:33.469 --> 50:35.470
We redo your experiment.

50:35.470 --> 50:37.472
Someplace where we can
fully analyze it.

50:37.472 --> 50:38.599
A real lab.

50:38.599 --> 50:40.475
Like the one at school.

50:40.475 --> 50:43.188
Okay, we'll start with
a basic sugar solution

50:43.188 --> 50:45.480
and keep adding chemicals
until we get the right
combination.

50:45.480 --> 50:47.024
Exactly. We'll know
we got it right

50:47.024 --> 50:48.483
when the moth vanishes.

50:48.483 --> 50:50.195
We'll catch a moth.
You head to school

50:50.195 --> 50:51.486
and start setting up
the lab.

50:51.486 --> 50:54.488
Go, Fighting Owls!

50:54.488 --> 50:57.491
Yeah, this probably wasn't
the right context for that.

51:02.496 --> 51:04.499
MOLLY:
Where are we going
to find a moth before midnight?

51:04.499 --> 51:07.501
CLEO:
Come on.
I know the perfect place.

51:09.504 --> 51:12.507
Cool. A cemetery
on Halloween!

51:12.507 --> 51:14.509
Great.

51:14.509 --> 51:16.510
The key to catching
a moth

51:16.510 --> 51:19.514
is to be
in the darkest place...

51:19.514 --> 51:21.515
( strikes match )

51:21.515 --> 51:23.517
...with the brightest light.

51:31.525 --> 51:34.528
Moth...

51:38.533 --> 51:39.533
CLEO:
This is crazy.

51:39.533 --> 51:42.536
Where are all the moths?

51:42.536 --> 51:44.538
MOLLY:
Here, mothy.

51:44.538 --> 51:46.540
Here, mothy mothy mothy.

51:46.540 --> 51:48.542
CLEO:
They're not cats, Molly.

51:48.542 --> 51:50.086
MOLLY:
Whatever.

51:51.545 --> 51:53.507
Cleo?

51:54.547 --> 51:56.550
It's no big deal, moths.

51:56.550 --> 51:58.552
Must have just been
the wind.

51:58.552 --> 52:00.554
I can get this back on
in no time.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.561
Cleo!

52:13.566 --> 52:15.403
Can you see me?

52:15.403 --> 52:18.531
Yeah. It's nice to
almost see your face again.

52:18.531 --> 52:19.573
Am I getting better?

52:21.574 --> 52:23.703
No, you're not.

52:23.703 --> 52:27.582
It's just the night mist
glistening in the moonlight.

52:27.582 --> 52:30.584
I'm scared, Cleo.

52:30.584 --> 52:32.585
Me too.

52:33.587 --> 52:35.588
But it's gonna be okay.

52:39.592 --> 52:40.594
MOLLY: Look!

53:00.613 --> 53:02.614
MOLLY: I got this.

53:02.614 --> 53:05.617
Molly, I don't think
this is a good idea.

53:05.617 --> 53:07.620
We don't have a choice,
Cleo.

53:07.620 --> 53:09.622
This moth may be
my only hope.

53:12.042 --> 53:13.625
Please be careful, Molly.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.627
I'm getting closer.

53:15.627 --> 53:17.630
Come on, moth!

53:17.630 --> 53:19.632
Almost got it. Almost there.

53:19.632 --> 53:21.633
- Hold on!
- Come on, moth!

53:21.633 --> 53:22.635
Ohh! I lost it!

53:22.635 --> 53:24.636
( both scream )

53:27.640 --> 53:29.641
( coughs )

53:30.643 --> 53:33.606
Molly, are you okay?

53:34.646 --> 53:37.484
( Molly grunting )

53:37.484 --> 53:40.070
<i>No! I am  not  okay!</i>

53:40.070 --> 53:42.654
I am very much not okay.

53:42.654 --> 53:45.657
I am in a cemetery,
at night, soaking wet,

53:45.657 --> 53:49.621
covered in swamp ooze,
and now I'm gonna
be invisible forever.

53:49.621 --> 53:51.663
- We still have time.
- Just forget about it.

53:51.663 --> 53:54.666
We can't.
We can't forget about it.
We can't give up.

53:54.666 --> 53:56.794
Maybe we should just go home,
leave all the lights on,

53:56.794 --> 53:59.671
- and try to draw a moth in.
- And then what?

53:59.671 --> 54:00.798
You can reverse
the invisibility?

54:00.798 --> 54:03.675
For sure? Because
as far as I can tell,

54:03.675 --> 54:06.678
you really have no idea what's
actually happening to me.

54:06.678 --> 54:10.516
I'm done.
I'm done with your science

54:10.516 --> 54:13.684
and your judgments
and your sarcasm.

54:13.684 --> 54:15.229
I'm done with all of it.

54:15.229 --> 54:18.689
Come on, Molly.
This isn't you.

54:18.689 --> 54:20.692
You're supposed to be
the positive one.

54:20.692 --> 54:22.694
Just leave me alone.

54:22.694 --> 54:25.406
If I'm gonna be
invisible forever

54:25.406 --> 54:27.699
and have my life
completely ruined,

54:27.699 --> 54:29.700
I want to face it alone.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.996
You of all people
can relate to that.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.708
Come on, Molly.

54:39.127 --> 54:41.713
Molly?

54:41.713 --> 54:44.715
Molly! Come on!
Come back! Molly!

54:49.721 --> 54:51.848
Molly?

54:51.848 --> 54:56.727
I don't know if you can hear me
or not, but if you can...

54:58.729 --> 55:02.733
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about the sarcasm.

55:04.028 --> 55:06.737
I'm sorry about everything.

55:08.739 --> 55:12.743
It's just not easy...
being your sister.

55:29.177 --> 55:31.761
You've got this thing...

55:34.057 --> 55:36.767
this light.

55:36.767 --> 55:40.770
Everyone is drawn to you.

55:43.773 --> 55:46.069
And it's hard sometimes...

55:48.738 --> 55:51.741
because...

55:51.741 --> 55:53.783
the truth is...

55:55.785 --> 55:58.788
that I've always
wanted to have that.

56:01.791 --> 56:05.505
And when...I didn't...

56:08.090 --> 56:12.802
it was much easier...

56:12.802 --> 56:16.806
to blame you...for feeling...

56:18.807 --> 56:20.810
...invisible.

56:22.812 --> 56:24.813
So...

56:27.817 --> 56:32.821
I pushed you away...

56:32.821 --> 56:36.826
and...everything...

56:38.828 --> 56:40.829
everything away.

56:46.836 --> 56:48.837
I should have come for froyo.

56:54.678 --> 56:56.554
MOLLY:
You can come for froyo
next time.

56:59.848 --> 57:00.849
Molly, you're here.

57:00.849 --> 57:02.851
I'm here, sis.

57:06.855 --> 57:07.856
He never saw me comin'.

57:26.874 --> 57:30.879
It's almost nine.
We only have a few hours
until midnight.

57:30.879 --> 57:32.880
Hopefully George has gotten
everything set up in the lab.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.426
MOLLY:
That would be great.

57:37.885 --> 57:40.888
Oh. Oh! Ohh. Ohh.

57:42.890 --> 57:43.891
( streetcar bell dings )

57:52.900 --> 57:54.902
Did you mean
what you said back there?

57:54.902 --> 57:56.904
About always
feeling invisible?

57:59.907 --> 58:01.909
I'm sorry.

58:01.909 --> 58:04.912
I had no idea.

58:04.912 --> 58:08.916
I get now how rough
that would have been.

58:08.916 --> 58:11.919
<i>he funny thing is,
've always been envious of  you.</i>

58:11.919 --> 58:14.922
- Me?
- Because you're a genius.

58:14.922 --> 58:16.924
You get straight A's
with your eyes closed.

58:16.924 --> 58:19.927
I kill myself
and barely pass.

58:19.927 --> 58:21.928
You have other things
going for you.

58:21.928 --> 58:23.931
Like what?

58:23.931 --> 58:27.227
Lacrosse?
Popularity?

58:27.227 --> 58:30.938
Both are pretty useless
after high school.

58:30.938 --> 58:33.941
Molly...

58:33.941 --> 58:35.943
that light I was talking about,

58:35.943 --> 58:37.944
it isn't because you're friendly

58:37.944 --> 58:41.949
or pretty or a good athlete,

58:41.949 --> 58:45.495
it's because...

58:45.495 --> 58:47.954
you make those around you happy.

58:49.957 --> 58:53.960
You see what they need,
and you make them better.

58:56.964 --> 58:59.966
It's like
the best kind of smart.

58:59.966 --> 59:01.968
You really think so?

59:03.930 --> 59:05.973
I know so.

59:05.973 --> 59:07.974
I've been you all day.

59:12.979 --> 59:15.982
Okay, there's just enough time
to go home and get changed

59:15.982 --> 59:17.984
before we meet George at school.

59:22.989 --> 59:24.992
Finally! Where have
you guys been?

59:24.992 --> 59:26.992
The building's locked.

59:26.992 --> 59:28.995
I don't know how we're
gonna get inside.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.003
Leave it to me.
I have an idea.

59:37.003 --> 59:41.006
That is why I do kung fu.

59:41.006 --> 59:43.008
I'm a black belt.

59:43.008 --> 59:45.304
Well, a brown belt.

59:45.304 --> 59:48.013
Oh, okay,
I'm a yellow belt.

59:48.013 --> 59:51.016
But I am a very advanced
yellow belt.

59:51.016 --> 59:52.017
( knock on door )

59:52.017 --> 59:55.021
Let me call you back.

01:00:03.028 --> 01:00:06.033
Hello?

01:00:06.033 --> 01:00:08.033
Anybody out here?

01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:36.061
( whoosh )

01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:27.111
Huh?

01:01:40.124 --> 01:01:41.250
MOLLY:
Boo!

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.126
Aah...

01:01:45.129 --> 01:01:49.132
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:00.143 --> 01:02:02.981
Let's add a little
more sodium...

01:02:09.152 --> 01:02:10.864
Okay, we got it.

01:02:10.864 --> 01:02:12.155
Good.
Let's analyze it

01:02:12.155 --> 01:02:14.158
so we can figure out
how to make an antidote.

01:02:18.161 --> 01:02:20.163
I don't understand.

01:02:20.163 --> 01:02:23.126
The solution's complex.

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:29.172
This is heavy
organic chemistry.

01:02:30.591 --> 01:02:32.175
So now what?

01:02:32.175 --> 01:02:34.177
We have to find someone
who can sort through this.

01:02:34.177 --> 01:02:36.179
Someone who knows
what all that means.

01:02:36.179 --> 01:02:38.180
Who?
A governor scholar
at chemistry.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.183
Believe it or not,
it's Carter.

01:02:40.183 --> 01:02:42.185
- What?
- It's true.

01:02:42.185 --> 01:02:44.897
I heard him talk about
a bunch of crazy science stuff
with George.

01:02:44.897 --> 01:02:47.190
Trust me, if anyone
can help us, it's him.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:49.191
And I know just where
to find him.

01:02:51.193 --> 01:02:53.196

MOLLY: Carter said
he's volunteering tonight.

01:03:02.204 --> 01:03:04.206
He's gotta be
in there somewhere.

01:03:04.206 --> 01:03:06.626
What's wrong.

01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:08.210
If I go in there,

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.212
then Carter's going to know
I like him.

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:12.633
And I do.

01:03:12.633 --> 01:03:14.217
And he likes you too.

01:03:14.217 --> 01:03:15.217
We don't know that,
Molly.

01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:18.220
If a girl like me lets on
she likes a guy like him,

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.516
then he usually ends up
laughing in her face.

01:03:20.516 --> 01:03:23.225
If he did that,
he'd miss out

01:03:23.225 --> 01:03:24.226

School rules still apply.

01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:40.368
What are you thinking?

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:41.368
COUG: Cleo?

01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:43.538
Oh, no.

01:03:43.538 --> 01:03:45.247
Um, hi, Coug.

01:03:45.247 --> 01:03:47.249
- Is your sister around?
- No, she's not,

01:03:47.249 --> 01:03:49.250
but we really have to go.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.252
Wait, wait.
I just really need to know.

01:03:50.252 --> 01:03:51.252
Is Molly dumping me?

01:03:51.252 --> 01:03:54.255
No, no, she's just
really busy.

01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:56.258
You don't have to
protect me, Cleo.

01:03:56.258 --> 01:03:58.260
She's avoiding me.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.261
I mean, she loves
Romp the Swamp.

01:04:00.261 --> 01:04:03.265
She'd never miss it.

01:04:03.265 --> 01:04:04.265
Would you just tell her
one thing?

01:04:04.265 --> 01:04:07.268
Tell her I just want her
to be happy.

01:04:07.268 --> 01:04:09.271
That's all I've
ever wanted.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.272
And if she's happier
without me,

01:04:11.272 --> 01:04:14.276
then I can learn
to live with that.

01:04:14.276 --> 01:04:17.278
Somehow.

01:04:17.278 --> 01:04:19.280
( sobbing )

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.284
The Coug's okay.
He's not crying.

01:04:23.284 --> 01:04:27.288
( Coug sobbing )

01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:30.290
Coug...

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.293
I've never been
the biggest fan of yours,

01:04:32.293 --> 01:04:34.295
but I was wrong.

01:04:34.295 --> 01:04:35.296
Hmm?

01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:37.258
Molly's really lucky
to have you.

01:04:37.258 --> 01:04:39.300
And if you'll just
give me a second,

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.301
she'll be back.

01:04:40.301 --> 01:04:42.303
I just miss her
so badly.

01:04:42.303 --> 01:04:44.305
MOLLY:
I miss you too, Coug.

01:04:44.305 --> 01:04:46.306
Molly?

01:04:46.306 --> 01:04:47.308
I'm not breaking up
with you.

01:04:47.308 --> 01:04:50.311
I'm right here.
I'm just invisible.

01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:52.313
Like you can't be hurt?

01:04:52.313 --> 01:04:55.316
No, that's "invincible",
babe.

01:04:55.316 --> 01:04:57.317
I'm "invisible".
I can't be seen.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:05:00.320
This is very confusing.

01:05:01.322 --> 01:05:03.324
Oh... Oh!

01:05:03.324 --> 01:05:05.325
Molly, it is you!

01:05:05.325 --> 01:05:07.327
Oh, I missed you too.

01:05:07.327 --> 01:05:09.330
Thank you for not
dumping me.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:11.331
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're invisible?

01:05:11.331 --> 01:05:14.335
Wait, what?
How?

01:05:14.335 --> 01:05:15.335
This is completely crazy!

01:05:15.335 --> 01:05:17.337
Coug, I'll explain later,

01:05:17.337 --> 01:05:18.338
but if we don't
find Carter now

01:05:18.338 --> 01:05:21.341
and make Molly visible
in less than an hour,

01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:23.343
you're going to go to prom
with an invisible girlfriend.

01:05:23.343 --> 01:05:25.345
Which won't make for
great couples pictures.

01:05:25.345 --> 01:05:27.057
Right?
Right.

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:28.348
Okay, let's split up.

01:05:28.348 --> 01:05:29.349
I'm gonna go to the yard,

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:30.350
and you go into the house,

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:32.352
and we'll meet in the barn
at the end, okay?

01:05:32.352 --> 01:05:33.353
Okay, yeah.
Let's go.

01:05:34.354 --> 01:05:39.359
( thunder, screams playing )

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.362
Have you seen Carter
anywhere?

01:05:52.372 --> 01:05:53.374
Have you seen a guy
named Carter?

01:05:53.374 --> 01:05:56.376
Uh-uh.

01:05:58.378 --> 01:05:59.922
You go in there.
I'm gonna go this way.

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:03.092
Oh, uh, excuse me,
do you know where
Carter is?

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:06.386
Soccer player,
about this tall,
luscious curls?

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:09.389
George, have you seen Molly?

01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:12.391
Uh, "seeing" is really
the tricky word there.

01:06:12.391 --> 01:06:15.394
We're out of snacks,
the bowl of fake eyeballs
turned mushy,

01:06:15.394 --> 01:06:18.397
the smoke machine
ran out of whatever
makes it make smoke.

01:06:18.397 --> 01:06:19.398
Molly is supposed
to be here.

01:06:19.398 --> 01:06:21.400
This is a complete
disaster.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.402
Nikki?
Yeah?

01:06:23.402 --> 01:06:25.404
It's not a disaster.

01:06:25.404 --> 01:06:29.243
This is the greatest
haunted house fundraiser ever.

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:30.702
Really?

01:06:30.702 --> 01:06:33.412
Definitely.

01:06:33.412 --> 01:06:34.413
Oh, are you having
a good time?

01:06:37.416 --> 01:06:42.130
See? She's happy,
and she doesn't even
have a head.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.422
You're doing a great job.

01:06:43.422 --> 01:06:45.424
Thanks.
You're a really...

01:06:45.424 --> 01:06:47.426
really nice guy,
George.

01:06:47.426 --> 01:06:50.429
Thanks.
You're nice too.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:53.432
Maybe we could
hang out sometime?

01:06:53.432 --> 01:06:55.434
I'd like that.

01:06:55.434 --> 01:06:57.435
Uh, great.

01:06:57.435 --> 01:07:00.438
To be continued.
See you soon.

01:07:07.445 --> 01:07:08.446
Carter!

01:07:08.446 --> 01:07:10.448
( sighs )

01:07:10.448 --> 01:07:12.450
Can you guys
give us a sec?

01:07:14.453 --> 01:07:16.454
Hey... you're here.

01:07:16.454 --> 01:07:19.457
You're late, but here.

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:21.294
And you're not
in costume.

01:07:21.294 --> 01:07:24.462
Um, no.
Costume?

01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:25.881
Your bear costume?

01:07:27.758 --> 01:07:30.468
Um... No.

01:07:30.468 --> 01:07:31.469
Can I ask you something?

01:07:31.469 --> 01:07:33.471
What's up with you?

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:37.475
I mean, generally,
you're kind of standoffish.

01:07:37.475 --> 01:07:40.478
Today you're actually
nice to me,

01:07:40.478 --> 01:07:42.480
and now you barely even
bother to show up.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.485
Carter, I'm so sorry
about the weirdness.

01:07:47.485 --> 01:07:52.032
The truth is...

01:07:52.032 --> 01:07:54.491
I have always wanted
to hang out with you.

01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:57.205
And I never thought
that you would want

01:07:57.205 --> 01:07:59.790
to ever hang out
with me.

01:08:06.504 --> 01:08:08.505
What are you wearing?

01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:11.509
Uh, I'm--
I'm honey.

01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:13.510
Honey?

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.512
Yeah, you know,
I thought, 'cause, you know,

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:18.515
with your bear costume,
I'd-- I'd be honey.

01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:21.518
'Cause, you know,
bears and honey are--

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:24.939
they're kind of a...
thing.

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:28.524
I-- I literally spent
all afternoon gluing felt.

01:08:28.524 --> 01:08:30.528
But, you know, since
you're not in costume,

01:08:30.528 --> 01:08:35.075
I-- I may have
overthought this
a little bit.

01:08:35.075 --> 01:08:38.535
I really want to talk
to you about this,

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:41.537
and I want to talk to you
about a lot of things.

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:45.835
But right now,
I really need your help.

01:08:45.835 --> 01:08:47.544
What is it?

01:08:47.544 --> 01:08:51.548
You should just not
see for yourself.

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:54.550
It's just over here
in the barn.

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:56.553
Isn't the barn
off-limits?

01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:00.099
Carter.

01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:02.558
Hey. Hello.

01:09:02.558 --> 01:09:04.560
What's going on?

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.563
Okay, here we go.

01:09:09.566 --> 01:09:11.568
Hey, Carter.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:14.571
Whoa, Carter,
Carter, Carter...

01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:18.573
Wow, this is
a sophisticated solution.

01:09:18.573 --> 01:09:20.576
But I think I can
work out an antidote.

01:09:20.576 --> 01:09:23.578
The problem is we only
have 45 minutes.

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:26.582
'Cause at midnight,
we're toast.

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:29.585
The tricky part is
after we create the antidote,

01:09:29.585 --> 01:09:32.587
we need to distill
its steam.
Of course.

01:09:32.587 --> 01:09:33.590
The steam is what
turned the moth invisible,

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.591
so that's what Molly needs
to drink.

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:37.593
But how? We don't have time
to get to the lab.

01:09:37.593 --> 01:09:40.430
We can make a homemade still.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.598
All we need are a few
simple components.

01:09:43.599 --> 01:09:46.602
Hey, sorry, fire code
violation, gotta take this.

01:09:46.602 --> 01:09:48.604
CLEO:
A heat source...

01:09:54.609 --> 01:09:56.612
some tubing...

01:09:56.612 --> 01:09:58.614
Sounds better
without these notes.

01:10:03.619 --> 01:10:05.620
CLEO:
... and a funnel
of some kind.

01:10:11.627 --> 01:10:15.630
CARTER:
Ok, so now that we've
created the antidote,

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:18.633
all we need to do
is boil it...

01:10:21.636 --> 01:10:22.638
then distill its steam...

01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:29.644
so that Molly can drink it
before midnight.

01:10:39.654 --> 01:10:41.656
Okay, here we go.

01:10:41.656 --> 01:10:43.658
It's almost midnight.
We've got 40 seconds.

01:10:43.658 --> 01:10:44.659
MOLLY:
Is it working?

01:10:44.659 --> 01:10:45.660
Just one drop...

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.661
and another one.

01:10:46.661 --> 01:10:48.663
This is gonna take forever.

01:10:51.666 --> 01:10:52.667
30 seconds.

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.668
Oh, come on, boil faster!

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:56.671
PERKINS (banging on door):
Hey! Open the door, people.

01:10:56.671 --> 01:10:59.674
- It's Perkins.
- Ignore him.

01:10:59.674 --> 01:11:01.676
PERKINS:
Whoever's in there
better come out,

01:11:01.676 --> 01:11:02.676
or you're gonna meet
my good friend,

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:04.679
Mr. Detention!

01:11:04.679 --> 01:11:07.224
Less than 20 seconds.

01:11:07.224 --> 01:11:08.682
Come on, work,
you stupid machine.

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:12.687
PERKINS:
Come on.
What's going on in there?

01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:17.109
( clock chiming )

01:11:17.109 --> 01:11:18.692
Okay, Molly,
this should be enough.

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:20.112
Drink it.

01:11:20.112 --> 01:11:22.697
PERKINS:
Seriously, open up!

01:11:22.697 --> 01:11:25.700
People, your actions
have consequences.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.701
MOLLY:
I have to do something
for you first.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:30.122
What are you doing?

01:11:30.122 --> 01:11:32.706
MOLLY:
It'll just take a second.

01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:36.710
You kids are in
some serious trouble!

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:38.712
Mr. Perkins, it's Molly.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:41.716
Cleo turned me invisible
for her science project.

01:11:41.716 --> 01:11:43.718
You have to know
how special she is.

01:11:43.718 --> 01:11:45.719
( clock chiming )

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:51.725
Oh, no.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.743
Molly, what did you do?

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:14.748
MOLLY:
I had to make sure
Mr. Perkins knew, Cleo.

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:17.751
You did something amazing
the world had to see.

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:19.753
We missed the deadline.

01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:22.756
MOLLY:
It was a risk I was
willing to take for you.

01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:25.759
Molly, I'll never see
your beautiful face again?

01:12:25.759 --> 01:12:28.762
That's okay, we can still
have a life together.

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:31.764
Maybe even with little
half-invisible kids someday.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.769
So you actually did this?

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:39.732
You really turned
your sister invisible.

01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:43.776
I-- I-- Okay,
I can't get my mind
around-- around this.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.195
Uh...

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:47.780
No, no, we can't give up.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.782
There has to be something else
that we can do.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.493
Your calculations were
conservative.

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:52.912
There should have been
enough time, it should
have worked.

01:12:52.912 --> 01:12:55.498
Well, then, there's
something we're missing.

01:12:55.498 --> 01:12:57.789
Molly, did you eat
anything weird last night?

01:12:57.789 --> 01:12:59.085
Meatballs.

01:12:59.085 --> 01:13:01.629
Huh? The meatballs.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.799
Wait, you had a game
the next day.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:08.801
You were nervous.
Ginger fizz.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:09.802
MOLLY:
I drank some
with the moth.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.804
Then that's what
we're missing.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:14.807
Its acidity must have
impacted the solution
somehow.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.808
Do you have any on you?

01:13:16.808 --> 01:13:19.812
MOLLY:
I never leave the house
without it.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.823
( liquid hissing )

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.826
Drink it.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.827
MOLLY:
Hey, no matter
what happens,

01:13:35.827 --> 01:13:38.831
I really liked spending
the day with you.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.832

your face again.

Wow. You finally took
your headphones off, Cleo.

01:14:42.893 --> 01:14:45.896
You did some real science.
Maybe a little too real.

01:14:48.899 --> 01:14:51.902
