WEBVTT

00:10.444 --> 00:14.148
*

00:45.679 --> 00:48.249
Oh. What's that?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.374
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:13.407 --> 01:16.110
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:16.144 --> 01:18.512
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:18.546 --> 01:19.747
* How, how, how, how

01:19.780 --> 01:22.250
* Hey, hey

01:28.156 --> 01:29.457
* You gotta come on.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.529
Gentlemen, your Sazeracs.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.830
Thank you.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.133
Here you go. Ah.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.435
Cheers.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.539
Do you notice the absinthe

01:45.573 --> 01:47.541
is slightly more herbaceous
than normal?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.277
I infused it with thyme

01:49.310 --> 01:50.444
and rosemary.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.812
Mmm.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.281
Best I ever had.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.149
Pride?
It's good.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.151
It's good, but, uh,

01:57.185 --> 02:00.588
a little more goes into being a
manager than just mixing drinks.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.591
Do you play any instruments,
Camille?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.159
Uh, instruments?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.427
Wait, wait, wait.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.695
How is that relevant?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.630
CAMILLE:
I took piano lessons

02:09.663 --> 02:10.864
when I was nine.
Does that count?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.201
Well, it's a good start.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.435
Uh,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.370
listen, thank you
for coming down.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.871
We got a few more people

02:17.905 --> 02:19.907
that we need to interview,
and then we'll let you know.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.709
All right. Great, thanks.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.345
Thank you.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.315
Are you kidding me?

02:27.348 --> 02:29.417
Who else you got to interview?

02:29.450 --> 02:30.618
The girl is perfect.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.853
She's efficient, smart,

02:32.886 --> 02:34.622
hip, gorgeous.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.624
Bar has history, Patton.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.825
My mama sang here.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.627
It's got to be the right fit.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
I think I'll know it
when I see it.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.432
And I hope you see it soon.
I'm running out of candidates.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.200
And you need a life.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.436
You can't keep running NCIS

02:48.469 --> 02:50.238
and this bar much longer.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.505
We'll find the right person.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.274
We just need
to keep looking, okay?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.243
I got a case.
I got to go, all right?

02:55.276 --> 02:56.877
So, uh,
I'll talk to you later.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.553
LASALLE:
A whole bunch of strange things

03:05.586 --> 03:07.421
going on here, King.

03:07.455 --> 03:11.225
First off, our victim is Chief
Petty Officer Charles Greene.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.593
Was a Master Diver for the Navy.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.961
Trained the SEALS
how to scuba,

03:13.994 --> 03:15.696
which means he's
not the type of person

03:15.729 --> 03:17.498
who's gonna die
out in the water.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.633
No, he teaches
folks how not to die.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.670
So likely we're not looking
at a diving accident.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.273
No, he's got plenty of oxygen
left in his tank.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.641
Plus, his diving regulator
and his buoyancy compensator,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.510
it's still in working condition.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.246
Yeah, who knew Alabama here
scuba dives, right?

03:32.280 --> 03:33.347
Roll tide.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.882
What you got, Loretta?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.350
Just a lot of questions.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.652
Look here.
The wounds are all fish bites,

03:38.686 --> 03:42.356
but this is some sort
of blunt force trauma.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.258
Concentric shape,
acute bruising.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.660
I've never seen
anything like it.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.795
It's definitely
the cause of death.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.363
Any theories?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.698
Boat of some kind?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500
No, boat would've
probably taken his head off,

03:52.533 --> 03:53.701
not gut punch him.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.403
Looks like he's
got the bends too.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.837
It's Cutis marmorata.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.673
Happens when divers
ascend too quickly

03:59.707 --> 04:01.309
from a great depth.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.676
So what happened first?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.712
The blunt force trauma
or he came up too fast?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.780
Can't tell
until I get him on my table.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.382
You narrow down TOD?

04:08.416 --> 04:11.552
Between 12 and 15 hours ago.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.421
Could've drifted
a long way in that time.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
Need to find out
where he died

04:15.623 --> 04:17.425
if we're gonna find out
what happened.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.692
Well, he had to
have a dive boat.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.695
Which means, it could still be
out there drifting somewhere.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.996
Floating crime scene maybe.

04:23.030 --> 04:23.997
PRIDE: Plus, the longer
it's out there,

04:24.031 --> 04:26.700
more chance the ocean
might've swallowed it up.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.836
I'll get Sebastian on it.

04:28.869 --> 04:29.970
Talk to Chief Greene's CO.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.505
Learn things.

04:31.539 --> 04:35.743
Master Diver killed
on the open sea.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.977
Got to be a reason.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.518
I just got off
the phone with the Navy.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.521
Got the rundown on Chief Petty
Officer Greene's personal life.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.056
Turns out the guy's a saint.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.691
Not so much
as a speeding ticket.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.793
Even works with
veterans' charities,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.829
teaches wounded warriors
to scuba in his spare time.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.665
Well, any professional
enemies?

04:57.698 --> 04:58.866
Well, I'm not sure.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.067
But he was involved in several

05:00.100 --> 05:01.902
special ops missions
with the SEALS.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.904
Does tend
to piss off the bad guys.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.773
Who might've been
looking for retribution.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.475
What were the missions?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.109
They're classified,
we're trying to get read in now.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.878
Thank you.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.079
Agent Russo.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.814
Agent Brody.
Hi.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.015
Hope I'm not interrupting.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.719
You, uh, care to introduce us?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.020
Oh, yeah, uh, sorry.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.555
Um, Pride, Percy, Lasalle,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.591
this is DHS Agent John Russo.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.493
He's the one
who helped me out in DC.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.395
Investigating
the General Matthews leak,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.829
appreciate the assist.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.598
Couldn't have done it
without Agent Brody.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.832
Glad you sent her.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.900
So what brings you
to New Orleans?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.035
Helping to set up
the new DHS post

05:35.068 --> 05:36.904
Matthews was supposed
to oversee.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.506
But who's gonna run it?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.907
I guess I am.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.476
At least until they find
a replacement for Matthews.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.044
Waterway security
is very important,

05:44.077 --> 05:45.479
especially around here.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.448
Something imminent?
No, no.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.649
Usual chatter.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.117
Nothing out of the ordinary.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.119
It's DC acting out
of an abundance of caution.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.654
Well, especially after

05:53.687 --> 05:54.922
what happened with Matthews.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.790
What
What's the connection?

05:56.824 --> 05:57.925
Probably nothing.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.393
But DHS wants to make sure

05:59.427 --> 06:00.928
nobody was trying
to discredit him in hopes

06:00.961 --> 06:02.663
that we wouldn't
still open this office.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.665
Again, covering bases.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.033
I'm gonna grab
Brody for a second,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.401
do you mind?
Sure.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.470
We'll just go out here.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.538
Nice to meet you all.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.805
Mm-hmm.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.809
I think she likes him.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.044
No,

06:17.077 --> 06:18.679
I think he likes her.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.681
I think the two of you need to

06:20.714 --> 06:22.816
get us read into
Greene's special ops missions.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.084
Copy that.

06:27.788 --> 06:31.459
RUSSO:
So, did you get my texts?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.862
Yeah.
Right.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.566
See, when someone texts you,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.800
normally the other person
texts back

06:39.833 --> 06:41.034
fairly quickly.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.570
That's kind of how it works.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.837
I know, I'm sorry.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.839
I just, I didn't
know how to respond.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.208
With you in DC and me here.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.444
It's not you, I just...

06:50.478 --> 06:52.446
I'm not ready to date yet,
that's all.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.982
Kind of going
through something.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.584
That's fair enough.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.686
That's actually not
why I was texting you.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.153
It's not?

07:01.689 --> 07:04.191
No, don't get me wrong.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.960
Listen, I'd love to take you
for drinks or dinner,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.729
but really I was
looking for some help.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.464
'Cause I knew
I was coming to town,

07:10.498 --> 07:11.832
I was hoping
you might be willing

07:11.865 --> 07:13.567
to give me the lay of the land.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.603
Oh.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.140
Got an appointment
with Greene's CO,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.610
said he could get us access
to those special ops missions.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.844
Good.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.878
Hopefully something
will turn up.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.113
Ah.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.616
Meantime...

07:28.649 --> 07:30.884
Narrow down where
the dive boat might be?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.085
It's not easy,

07:32.119 --> 07:33.521
especially considering the Gulf

07:33.554 --> 07:35.155
is over 600,000 square miles.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.757
That's before you even factor in

07:36.790 --> 07:38.759
tidal projections,
current patterns, wind,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.761
for both where the victim
might've been killed,

07:40.794 --> 07:43.531
and where the boat
might've drifted from.
Tick-tock, Sebastian.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.534
Right, sorry, I'm trying to work
on the whole rambling thing.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.836
Anyway, uh, thanks to
our Coast Guard friends,

07:48.869 --> 07:51.639
and they're pretty snazzy
SAROPS program...

07:51.672 --> 07:53.040
* Ta-da

07:53.073 --> 07:56.076
I was able to generate
a probability grid.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.913
So each grid represents
a potential search area.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.583
Green for where Chief Greene
might have been diving,

08:02.616 --> 08:03.784
and the Red is...

08:03.817 --> 08:06.654
I'm sorry, uh, who

08:06.687 --> 08:08.856
Oh, Agent Russo, this is our
forensic scientist, Sebastian.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.057
Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.059
Agent Russo.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.595
Uh, as in DC Agent Russo?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.063
Uh, yeah.
Uh...

08:16.096 --> 08:17.264
I'm gonna...

08:17.297 --> 08:18.699
I'm gonna show him out.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.671
Red grid, Sebastian.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.673
Hmm? Yeah, uh, sorry.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.207
The, uh, the red grids
are the areas

08:27.240 --> 08:29.943
of the highest probability
of finding the dive boat.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.645
If it's still upright, that is.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.648
Uh, there was some pretty
big swells last night.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.049
Did we know
that Russo was coming?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.084
Thanks, Sebastian.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.053
Brody and I will
coordinate with Coast Guard,

08:40.087 --> 08:41.054
try and track down the boat.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.691
You two get with Greene's CO

08:43.724 --> 08:45.693
and learn things.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.305
BRODY:
11 grids down,

08:58.338 --> 08:59.707
only three to go.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.610
What if we can't find it, Pride?

09:02.643 --> 09:06.313
I don't know we'd find out who
killed Chief Greene if we don't.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.883
What do you got?
Something on the water.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.620
A couple hundred yards north.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.658
I got it.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.694
Matches the model
registered to Greene.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.230
Let's get ready to board.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.904
PRIDE:
Cast off blood stains.

09:30.938 --> 09:34.274
Looks like a fight.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.257
PRIDE:
Whoa.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.158
Stay the hell away!

09:51.191 --> 09:52.159
Whoa, whoa.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.260
NCIS.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.062
Put down the gun.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.129
Drop your weapon.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.666
I'll shoot.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.169
No, you won't.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.173
Marine Corps,

10:06.206 --> 10:08.909
3rd Battalion, 23rd regiment.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.011
I know your Gunny Sergeant,
Karl Williams.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.047
I know he trains his marines
to do the right thing.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.315
And right now,

10:15.348 --> 10:16.750
the thing to do

10:16.784 --> 10:18.318
is to lower your weapon.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.054
Come on now.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.791
You need medical attention.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.394
And we need to find out
what happened out here.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.140
Your turn.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.746
Easy.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.084
Okay, okay. Oh!

10:51.118 --> 10:52.986
Easy. Easy.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.074
LASALLE:
According to his I.D.,

11:14.107 --> 11:16.409
Lieutenant Michael Buckley
was a former

11:16.443 --> 11:17.811
Marine Platoon Commander.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.446
Did three tours in Afghanistan.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.715
Was injured in an IED attack

11:21.749 --> 11:23.884
on his last one.
BRODY:
Wounded warrior,

11:23.917 --> 11:25.285
just like who Greene
taught to scuba.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.154
Might explain
why he was on the boat.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.158
SONJA:
Yeah, but it still
doesn't explain

11:31.191 --> 11:32.392
how the spear was
in his shoulder,

11:32.425 --> 11:34.427
and why he was
pointing a gun at Pride.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.496
Yeah, still, he's had a few
run-ins with the law,

11:36.529 --> 11:38.899
and he's got some
psychological issues,

11:38.932 --> 11:41.134
PTSD.
BRODY:
Emotional distress,

11:41.168 --> 11:43.771
temporary psychosis,
both signs of PTSD.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.906
Might've been in the midst
of an episode when we found him.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.908
So, what? He and Greene

11:47.941 --> 11:51.178
get into an argument
and then Buckley snaps?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
Greene tries to defend himself
with the spear gun,

11:53.814 --> 11:55.315
but Buckley still manages
to kill him.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.285
I mean, we could be dealing with
another American Sniper.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.320
BRODY:
Scuba tanks on board.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.388
Round, heavy objects.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.290
Might explain the blunt
force trauma on Greene.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.326
He would've had
to swing it awful hard.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.928
Besides, we don't know
conclusively

12:07.961 --> 12:12.032
if Greene was killed
above water or below.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.466
There's something
more going on here.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.803
Or it looks how it looks.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.172
I mean, both Greene and Buckley
were the only two on the boat.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.474
And there was a fight,
I mean, we can't ignore that.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.811
We can't ignore the threats
Greene's unit received

12:23.844 --> 12:25.278
from his missions
overseas either.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.815
Went through the files
you got from Greene's CO.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.017
Made a lot of enemies.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.551
Well, if we're looking for
someone who could take out

12:31.584 --> 12:33.286
a Master Diver,
that certainly fits the bill.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.089
If so,

12:36.123 --> 12:38.091
other people would've
been out there too.

12:38.125 --> 12:42.429
Making Buckley
a victim instead of a suspect.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.898
Best way to find out who all was
on board is to test that blood.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.034
Samples on their way
to Sebastian now.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.001
Yeah, we'll follow up

12:48.035 --> 12:50.237
and let you know as soon
as he I.D.'s someone.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.539
Maybe I should stay,
recreate the fight.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.974
Figure out what really happened.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.042
Good idea.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.177
I'll go to the hospital.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.445
Talk to Lieutenant Buckley.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.413
Get his side of things.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.426
Buckley?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.129
Need to ask you some questions.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.865
Is Charlie okay?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.467
No, he's not.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.404
We found Chief Petty Officer
Greene's body this morning.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.973
Washed up on shore.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.379
Whatever happened out there,

13:32.412 --> 13:34.514
you know.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.916
You think I did this?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.217
Did you?

13:37.250 --> 13:41.989
I don't know.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.091
Everything's kind of a...

13:44.124 --> 13:45.325
a blur.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.526
But look at my life,

13:46.559 --> 13:48.095
I guess if I screwed that up,

13:48.128 --> 13:49.629
I must've screwed
this up, right?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.631
I just need you to try

13:51.664 --> 13:54.134
to remember what happened.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.402
I can't.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.240
I believe that you can.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.508
You just need to relax, okay?

14:01.541 --> 14:04.945
Focus on your breathing.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.246
Hmm?

14:06.279 --> 14:09.149
Just like you were diving.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.086
Keep that focus.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.157
Let's go back to the boat,
yesterday afternoon.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.961
All right?

14:20.994 --> 14:24.364
You're on the water.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.200
What do you see?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.568
It's um...

14:28.601 --> 14:31.038
It's windy.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.372
Choppy seas.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.441
But Charlie,
he still wants to out.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.943
He wants to go diving.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.378
But not me, 'cause I'm-I'm
not much of a diver.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.646
Keep going.

14:39.679 --> 14:43.616
Then Charlie, he was, uh...

14:43.650 --> 14:45.452
he was down there
for a long time.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.988
And I...

14:49.122 --> 14:51.658
Oh, these two, um...

14:51.691 --> 14:53.093
frog men in tactical gear,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.928
they got onto
the boat with us.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.964
Wait, tactical gear?
Where'd they come from?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.231
Wait, you don't believe me?

14:58.265 --> 15:02.235
I...

15:02.269 --> 15:03.470
Where'd they come from?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.172
The water. I...

15:07.140 --> 15:09.943
I think, um...

15:09.977 --> 15:11.111
I...

15:11.144 --> 15:13.981
This one, he had a spear gun,

15:14.014 --> 15:17.150
and he shot me,
and I, uh...

15:17.184 --> 15:19.119
I don't remember
what happened after that.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.353
All right, try. I know you...

15:20.387 --> 15:22.322
I can't!

15:25.192 --> 15:27.460
All right.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.232
What you got, Brody?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.533
I found something interesting

15:33.566 --> 15:35.068
when I was measuring
the blood spatter.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.670
One spray pattern
is definitely from Buckley

15:37.704 --> 15:39.239
when he got hit by the spear,

15:39.272 --> 15:41.541
but behind him there was a void

15:41.574 --> 15:43.743
with spray patterns
on both sides of where he was.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.345
Which means?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.646
Which means, if I'm right,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.648
there was a second person
behind him.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.050
Two assailants.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.384
Buckley remembered right.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.686
He just told me two people
in tactical gear

15:53.720 --> 15:55.422
came out of the water
and attacked him.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.157
Question is, who are they?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.625
Men in tactical gear.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.027
Might've been enemies

16:00.060 --> 16:01.194
Greene made overseas.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.495
Yeah, well, hopefully Sebastian

16:02.529 --> 16:04.564
can I.D. the blood
and get their names.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.233
SEBASTIAN:
We got our results.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.168
There was definitely
somebody else on that boat.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.369
Found two

16:09.402 --> 16:10.737
unique DNA types.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.639
One belongs to Buckley.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.241
But the other was
not in the database.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.109
Meaning our assailants remain
one big, fat mystery,

16:16.143 --> 16:17.444
so please,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.679
do you have anything else
for us to work off of?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.015
Well, we've learned more
about Greene's injuries

16:22.049 --> 16:24.484
and they're far more
catastrophic than anticipated.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.187
The liver, pancreas,
spleen all essentially

16:27.220 --> 16:28.455
decimated.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.391
Sadly, Chief Petty Officer's
final moments

16:31.424 --> 16:33.260
were incredibly painful.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.495
Yeah, it doesn't sound like
a scuba tank had the velocity

16:35.528 --> 16:36.729
to cause this kind of damage.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.431
Whatever did hit him that hard,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.500
caused Greene to inhale massive
amounts of water at once.

16:40.533 --> 16:44.037
His lungs and stomach
were full of sea water.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.273
Well, at least we know
he didn't die on that boat.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.607
No, he definitely
died underwater.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.409
So no clue as to
how this happened?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.743
No.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.312
But there's one way to find out.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.680
Go to the scene of the crime.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.515
Right, which we now know

16:55.548 --> 16:57.517
was about two miles
off the coast

16:57.550 --> 16:59.386
and 100 feet down.
Well, how'd you figure that out?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.521
Well, we already had
the SAROPS projections,

17:01.554 --> 17:03.423
which gave us the area
where Greene had been diving.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.492
To really hone in,
we had to get microscopic.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.394
And that's where our little
friend the phytoplankton

17:07.427 --> 17:09.129
came in handy.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.730
They're tiny organisms
found in seawater.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.499
Including the water
in Greene's system.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.468
Now, every phyto comes from
a very specific location.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.470
It's all traceable,
so it shouldn't be hard

17:17.504 --> 17:19.606
to find the spot
where it all went down.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.474
You feel like taking
a dive with me?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.576
If I had a choice,

17:23.610 --> 17:27.414
the swimming pool's
as deep as I'll go.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.657
Ready?

17:37.690 --> 17:40.827
I was born ready.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.605
PRIDE:
All right, you're 50 feet down.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.541
About 50 more to go.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.109
LASALLE:
Copy that, King.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.682
You all right, buddy?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.684
These, uh, anti

18:04.717 --> 18:06.353
They're false advertising.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.520
I think they're making it worse.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.289
So, uh,

18:09.322 --> 18:11.658
what's, uh, what's
Agent Russo doing here again?

18:11.691 --> 18:14.261
Just setting up an office.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.295
:
Oh.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.429
Permanently?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.666
Hold that thought!

18:23.603 --> 18:24.837
LASALLE:
Hey, King?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.739
We're definitely
in the right area.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.177
PRIDE:
What's going on, Christopher?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.245
I'm almost at the sea floor.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.347
And there's some kind
of light down here.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.716
Yes, sir, we're cooking
with peanut oil.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.351
It's a video camera.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.488
I bet you
Petty Officer Greene dropped it.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.836
Holy crap! Is that a sub?

19:12.919 --> 19:16.456
Well, now we know
what killed Greene.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.527
But not why.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.673
A Master Diver
for the U.S. Navy

19:33.706 --> 19:35.642
nearly gets disemboweled
by a sub

19:35.675 --> 19:37.577
that clearly turned
to take him out.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.279
Wrong place, wrong time?

19:39.312 --> 19:41.381
Yes, don't know
what else it could be.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.284
Greene was just pleasure-diving,
taking pictures.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.785
So after the killers
take him out,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.521
they don scuba gear,
egress out of the sub.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.989
Try to take Buckley out, too,
cover their tracks.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.224
Except...

19:51.258 --> 19:52.825
he put up one hell of a fight.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.462
Navy Intel have any idea
who we're up against?

19:55.495 --> 19:56.963
All they know is
they don't think it's

19:56.996 --> 19:59.932
connected to any
of Greene's SEAL missions.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.668
Then what?
Drug runners?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.803
Hey, you read my mind.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.938
Cartels have been using subs

20:05.972 --> 20:08.808
to smuggle drugs for years,
and Greene

20:08.841 --> 20:11.778
was diving smack in the middle
of one of their routes.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.979
Well, check with DEA.
See if they've heard

20:13.012 --> 20:14.914
any recent chatter
from the cartels

20:14.947 --> 20:16.516
to back this up.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.618
All right, so you
want the good news,

20:18.651 --> 20:19.919
or the bad news?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.488
Always start
with the good.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.623
I got the manager
over at the Sazerac bar

20:23.656 --> 20:25.258
to come in
for an interview.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.493
If we land him,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.261
it'd be like the Heat
poaching LeBron.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.630
The case, Patton.
BRODY: All right.
That's the bad news.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.632
Reached out to NSA
and Border Patrol,

20:32.665 --> 20:34.934
trying to get access
to their sonar system logs.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.403
'Cause if we get the logs,

20:36.436 --> 20:37.637
then maybe we can track the sub.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.938
But nobody's giving us access.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.273
All requests have to be
run up the ladder.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.541
It's a sea of red tape.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.410
Red tape,
we don't have time for.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.846
We got two men in tactical gear,
driving a sub.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.415
Killed one sailor.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.651
Tried to kill a Marine.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.453
I got a feeling we're dealing
with something

20:53.486 --> 20:54.987
bigger than drug runners.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.055
It sounds like DHS territory.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.691
You think your friend Russo

20:58.725 --> 21:00.660
might be willing
to do us a favor?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.862
I can ask.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.571
RUSSO:
Okay.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
Put a surveillance team on them.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.675
Uh, yeah, get back to me.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.344
Hi.
Hi.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.579
I thought you said nothing
unusual was happening.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.813
It looks like plenty
is happening to me.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.315
It's DHS, Brody.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.850
Something's always happening.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.018
Listen, if you're here
to give me a tour of the city,

21:26.052 --> 21:27.520
wish I could, but...

21:27.554 --> 21:29.322
Actually, I'm here
because I need a favor.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.490
Okay.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.359
A submarine took out

21:32.392 --> 21:33.826
a Navy diver
two miles off shore.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.563
We're trying to figure out
who's responsible,

21:36.596 --> 21:38.064
and, uh, we're hoping DHS
can give us access

21:38.097 --> 21:40.500
to sonar logs.
Come with me.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.970
How big was the sub?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.372
How big?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.006
15, 25, 100 meters?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.641
Closer to 25.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.410
Like a narco sub.
Yeah.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.778
But with deep water
capabilities.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.313
Hit the diver
at a hundred feet.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.917
You're not just in New Orleans
out of an abundance of caution,

21:57.950 --> 21:59.619
are you?
Something is happening.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.087
We still don't know.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.089
Surveillance intercepted chatter

22:03.122 --> 22:04.657
about several foreign assets

22:04.691 --> 22:05.658
operating in the Gulf.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.594
We don't know who's behind it,

22:07.627 --> 22:09.829
but we think they might
be planning some kind

22:09.862 --> 22:11.431
of an attack.
We didn't have

22:11.464 --> 22:13.099
hard evidence
to confirm that,

22:13.132 --> 22:14.934
until now.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.370
Is that the sub?

22:17.404 --> 22:19.972
Looks like it, yes.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.040
Sonar techs were
doing a routine scan

22:21.073 --> 22:22.108
when they picked it up.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.576
Tracked it all the way

22:23.610 --> 22:24.777
to an abandoned shipyard
off the Mississippi

22:24.811 --> 22:26.045
where they ditched.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.647
We think they were
smuggling something

22:27.680 --> 22:29.382
into the country to
pull off the attack.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.650
What were they smuggling?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.719
Equipment, people, weapons?

22:32.752 --> 22:33.920
Unclear.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.389
All we know right now

22:36.423 --> 22:38.024
is that an event
appears imminent.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.126
Whether New Orleans is a target
or the entry point,

22:40.159 --> 22:41.160
we don't know.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.662
But you think this is why

22:42.695 --> 22:43.663
whoever's behind it didn't want

22:43.696 --> 22:45.632
DHS setting up an office here

22:45.665 --> 22:47.767
or the waterway
protection post filled.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.104
I think it's time that
we started working together.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.478
BRODY: Okay, it turns out
that Greene's murder

22:58.511 --> 23:01.414
had nothing to do with his past
missions or the cartels.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.683
Apparently, he stumbled
across a pair of enemy

23:03.716 --> 23:05.785
combatants planning
some kind of attack.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.920
Combatants Agent Russo's
been aware of since he arrived.

23:07.954 --> 23:08.955
Wasn't exactly

23:08.988 --> 23:11.090
forthcoming with us.
LASALLE: And if we hadn't

23:11.123 --> 23:14.160
found that sub,
we'd still be left in the dark.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.696
Does DHS have any idea
what they're targeting?

23:16.729 --> 23:20.967
No, but, we may have a lead
on who we're after.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.703
DHS found a substantial amount
of blood in the sub,

23:23.736 --> 23:24.771
matches one
of the types of blood

23:24.804 --> 23:26.506
found on Greene's dive boat.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.741
No I.D. hit yet, but we're
hoping Sebastian can find

23:28.775 --> 23:31.177
some kind of physical
characteristic of our assailant.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.512
Because he was injured.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.279
By Buckley, probably.

23:33.312 --> 23:34.614
That much blood
loss explains

23:34.647 --> 23:35.848
why they ditched the sub,

23:35.882 --> 23:37.984
someone needed
medical attention.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.519
Which means our injured
assailant might have gone

23:39.552 --> 23:40.720
to a regional hospital,
underground clinic.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.988
I've got a CI

23:42.021 --> 23:43.189
who can help us find
those clinics.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.491
I'll pay him a visit.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.058
Still, this is New Orleans.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.927
As great as it is, a lot of
violent crimes every day.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.896
ERs are overflowing.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.664
Yeah, we got to find a way
to narrow it down.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.534
PRIDE:
Buckly.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.603
Hey.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.671
Where you going?

23:58.705 --> 24:00.039
You cleared me.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.874
Look, I'm out of here, man.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.946
Look, I need your help.

24:06.979 --> 24:10.082
I don't think I can solve
Greene's murder without it.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.019
My memory, it...

24:13.052 --> 24:14.587
I get confused.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.922
I... you don't know
what's it's like

24:15.955 --> 24:16.923
in my head.

24:16.956 --> 24:17.957
No, no, you're right.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.191
I-I-I don't but...

24:19.225 --> 24:23.630
I know you carried a...
an injured marine

24:23.663 --> 24:26.599
across a battlefield
under enemy fire.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.737
I read your file.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.572
You can do that,
you can do this.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.842
You can trust me.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.212
Just like you trusted
your friend, Greene.

24:40.246 --> 24:44.584
Can you put yourself
back on that dive boat,

24:44.617 --> 24:47.687
after the frog men got on board?

24:52.224 --> 24:54.026
Okay, there's...

24:54.060 --> 24:55.595
there's one of them...

24:55.628 --> 24:58.698
he's... he's in front of me...

24:58.731 --> 25:01.901
he's got a spear gun and, uh...

25:01.934 --> 25:04.103
the second one's trying
to sneak up behind.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.738
Okay, good.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.206
The one in front, he fires,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.775
the spear goes through me...

25:08.808 --> 25:11.744
I fall backwards, I...

25:11.778 --> 25:13.846
almost pass out, but I know
I got to do something so...

25:13.880 --> 25:15.848
the one behind me,
I... I back up

25:15.882 --> 25:19.085
to him and I ram the spear
un... under his ribs,

25:19.118 --> 25:20.853
and I get him in the kidney.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.188
The kidney

25:22.221 --> 25:23.222
Yeah.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.323
Use any weapon available

25:24.356 --> 25:26.058
to inflict maximum damage.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.728
I knew you could do it.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.066
Okay, Ochsner ER has
two more, which brings

25:34.100 --> 25:36.869
the total number of patients
who fit the profile to...

25:36.903 --> 25:38.605
77.

25:38.638 --> 25:39.606
Thank you.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.840
Brody's found five more

25:40.873 --> 25:42.241
at underground clinics.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.143
So... 82.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.244
That's too many to vet.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.614
Oh, hello.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.215
Please, tell us

25:49.248 --> 25:51.083
you found something
on those blood samples.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.352
Well, thanks to the
marvels of modern science,

25:53.385 --> 25:56.689
we've been able to identify
our submariner's race and sex.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.726
Yeah, one shake of the old,
magic DNA 8-ball here and...

25:59.759 --> 26:02.729
the assailant you're looking
for is female and Caucasian.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.597
Bringing us to...

26:04.631 --> 26:05.998
13, I mean,

26:06.032 --> 26:07.033
we can check them out,

26:07.066 --> 26:08.267
but we're gonna need time.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.301
Yeah, we're running
out and fast.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.637
Is there any way we can narrow

26:10.670 --> 26:12.171
it down more?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.741
Ask and you shall receive.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.042
That's Pride...

26:16.075 --> 26:17.777
he says we're looking
for a lacerated kidney.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.746
Run it.
:
Lacerated kidney.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.047
Down to four.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.248
Boom.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.249
WADE: Great.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.251
What are you waiting on?

26:25.284 --> 26:27.186
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, get.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.760
God, it's like
a Rockwell painting.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.262
I don't think we're gonna find
any foreign agents here.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.698
Still, we're running
out of suspects.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.735
It looks like Pride and Brody
are striking out, too.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.003
Hi.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.738
Excuse me.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.006
Mrs. Judy Brown?

26:47.039 --> 26:48.274
Yes?

26:48.307 --> 26:50.342
We're federal agents.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.411
We understand
that you were injured.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.780
Was wondering
if you could tell us how,

26:53.813 --> 26:54.914
if you don't mind.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.783
The police came
to the hospital.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.417
I-I gave a statement.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.919
Oh, well, you know,
if it's all right with you,

26:59.952 --> 27:01.954
we just want to hear
it one more time.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.424
Judy's a little embarrassed.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.794
She's normally a really good
driver, she knows better.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.728
I couldn't

27:08.761 --> 27:10.062
have been looking
at my phone for more than

27:10.096 --> 27:11.430
a few seconds.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.667
I-I just lost control
and... hit a tree.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.335
Air bag deployed?

27:16.368 --> 27:19.772
Yeah, but I wasn't wearing
my seat belt. I...

27:19.806 --> 27:22.074
I was in a hurry,
I wasn't thinking.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.443
Well, you're lucky
it wasn't much worse.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.414
So, you hit a tree,
your air bag deployed...

27:30.016 --> 27:31.217
...and you lacerated
your kidney,

27:31.250 --> 27:32.785
from a frontal impact?

27:34.353 --> 27:36.122
SONJA: Gun!

27:36.155 --> 27:37.957
Arthur, run!

27:38.825 --> 27:40.392
Don't move.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.928
Yeah, Chris,
you and Sonja,

28:15.962 --> 28:18.297
if you find anything of
interest at the Brown's house,

28:18.330 --> 28:20.266
let me know ASAP, okay?

28:20.299 --> 28:21.801
Russo.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.470
Good work, at least
you got one of them.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.205
Partner's still
at large, though.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.807
NOPD and Homeland Security
have BOLOs out.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.341
We'll find him.
It's a matter

28:29.375 --> 28:30.476
of time.

28:30.509 --> 28:31.911
DHS'll take it from here.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.112
Uh... hang on.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.382
Brody, take her
to interrogation.

28:37.784 --> 28:38.751
Go ahead.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.987
Roy.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.492
All due respect, Agent Pride,
if she's a foreign agent,

28:46.525 --> 28:48.227
she belongs to DHS now.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.830
Well, we don't
know that yet,

28:50.863 --> 28:53.465
but here's what we do know.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.235
She killed a
United States Sailor.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.437
That makes this

28:58.470 --> 29:02.975
an NCIS case
and her an NCIS suspect.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.376
Look, I'm not
trying to turn this

29:04.410 --> 29:05.444
into a jurisdictional thing.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.114
Then don't.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.916
I understand your position.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.383
I'm not trying
to step on your toes,

29:11.417 --> 29:12.852
but you have to admit,

29:12.885 --> 29:14.120
this is potentially
bigger than NCIS.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.855
Agreed.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.256
Still not giving her up,

29:17.289 --> 29:19.125
unless someone above me

29:19.158 --> 29:20.526
orders me to.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.997
End of the day, we both
want to catch her partner,

29:25.031 --> 29:27.299
find out who's really
behind this and why.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.002
How about we keep
working the case together?

29:30.036 --> 29:31.270
We'll combine what we know.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.972
You okay with that?

29:46.585 --> 29:48.487
Ran checks on you,
Mrs. Brown.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.091
Everything looks
to be completely normal.

29:52.124 --> 29:56.295
DMV, tax filings, all clean.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.064
Only one problem.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.034
Records only go back two years.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.903
Before that,

30:03.936 --> 30:05.905
it's as if you
and your husband never existed.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.974
Not a very good cover...

30:08.007 --> 30:10.509
unless you
weren't planning

30:10.542 --> 30:13.012
on staying around
for very long.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.882
Don't know what
you're talking about.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.016
Interpol is running

30:17.049 --> 30:18.885
your DNA as we speak.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.053
Any assassination attempt...

30:21.087 --> 30:22.621
any terrorist act
you've ever committed...

30:22.654 --> 30:24.123
we're gonna find out.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.591
And then the U.S. Government's

30:25.624 --> 30:27.526
gonna send you to Guantanamo.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.930
We're talking
isolation cells,

30:30.963 --> 30:33.065
23 hours a day.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.134
The rest of your life.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.871
You don't scare me.

30:38.905 --> 30:41.373
No?

30:43.375 --> 30:45.444
:
Nothing gets to you, does it?

30:45.477 --> 30:48.614
You don't have
a single pressure point,

30:48.647 --> 30:51.183
not even family.

30:53.085 --> 30:56.422
Parents, siblings,

30:56.455 --> 30:59.258
nieces and nephews.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.628
We find out who you really are,

31:02.661 --> 31:05.264
we start investigating
them, too.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.234
Two foreign operatives
planted as a married couple.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.501
You tell us
where to find your husband,

31:09.535 --> 31:11.237
or I promise you,
all bets are off.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.980
Since when do
we threaten family members?

31:21.013 --> 31:23.015
Since terrorists
began decapitating people.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.417
Look, we got the location

31:25.451 --> 31:26.953
of the hideout, didn't we?

31:26.986 --> 31:28.487
How far away is Pearl River?

31:28.520 --> 31:32.024
North Shore, 30 minutes
with patrol lights on.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.092
But what if she's lying?

31:33.125 --> 31:34.393
What if he's not really there?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.695
She seemed genuinely
afraid to me.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.530
I'll send a team
to check it out.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.232
Now hold on.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.400
Whole area's flat.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.035
Views as far
as the eye can see.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.303
Your men roll up
on the main road,

31:44.336 --> 31:46.272
her partner'll see
them a mile off.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.174
All right, what do you suggest?

31:48.207 --> 31:49.575
I know a back way.

31:49.608 --> 31:50.676
Not on the map.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.144
Ride with me,
I'll show you.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.179
Agent Pride.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.714
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

31:55.747 --> 31:57.683
if Mrs. Brown
were transferred to DHS.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.285
It's more secure.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.020
I can have agents
here in ten minutes.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.991
All right.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.458
Brody, stay here,
facilitate the transfer.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.227
Will do.

32:10.296 --> 32:13.165
SONJA:
You know, this house

32:13.199 --> 32:15.601
is Mr. Clean clean.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.270
There's no sign of
any criminal activity.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.173
And this sucker is locked up
tighter than Fort Knox.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.409
Multiple layers of encryption.
I got to get this back

32:23.442 --> 32:25.077
to the lab, see if
I can crack this sucker.

32:25.111 --> 32:29.115
Yeah, the only thing
I found strange are these.

32:29.148 --> 32:32.118
Mr. and Mrs. Bond visited maybe

32:32.151 --> 32:35.187
the most romantic
destinations in the city.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.689
Hmm, pretty damn intimate
for a couple of operatives.

32:37.723 --> 32:38.690
Yeah.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.459
Kind of unusual, but then again,

32:40.492 --> 32:42.061
NOLA does that to folks.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.063
A little more intimate
than even that.

32:44.096 --> 32:48.067
Clomid. "Use daily
to promote ovulation."

32:48.100 --> 32:50.569
Looks like they were trying
to make baby agents.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.208
You got Agent Russo here too,
Chris. What do you got?

32:56.242 --> 32:59.545
No smoking guns, but we did
find something very peculiar.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.547
Looks like Arthur
and Judy were doing more

33:01.580 --> 33:03.249
than just pretending
to be in love.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.717
They actually visited
a bunch of romantic spots

33:05.751 --> 33:07.219
all over the city.

33:07.253 --> 33:08.754
Part of their cover, maybe.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.756
Fertility drugs part
of their cover, too?

33:10.789 --> 33:13.092
Call me crazy,
but most operatives

33:13.125 --> 33:14.460
don't go that deep undercover.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.095
Unless they really are in love.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.497
Think about it--
Arthur blew his cover

33:18.530 --> 33:20.166
by bringing Judy
to the hospital,

33:20.199 --> 33:22.168
took care of her instead
of getting out of town.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.036
Because he cared about her

33:24.070 --> 33:25.637
and they were trying
to start a family.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.073
Okay, but if you're right,
then why

33:27.106 --> 33:28.140
would she give up his location?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.210
She wouldn't.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.783
Hey, Pride.
PRIDE: Brody.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.785
Listen to me,
it's a setup.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.520
Shots fired.

33:48.294 --> 33:51.230
Roy.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.346
*

34:21.727 --> 34:23.462
RUSSO:
Brody!

34:42.314 --> 34:43.615
You okay?

34:43.649 --> 34:45.617
Yeah.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.619
Thank you.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.596
PRIDE:
Yeah, thank you.

34:57.629 --> 35:00.566
Roy just got out of surgery.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.900
He's gonna be fine.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.435
Well, that's
good to hear.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.770
Don't know if we
can say the same

35:04.803 --> 35:05.804
about our squad room though.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.805
What a damn mess.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.340
Yeah, it is.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.677
Well, I'm just glad
everybody's okay.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.779
Loretta, Sebastian,
what you got?

35:13.812 --> 35:15.247
Look at this.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.249
Grayish peeling and flaking.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.585
What is it?
Usually from handling
explosives.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.254
Lots of it.
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, and not just
any explosives either.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.589
This red means HMX.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.291
It's military grade.

35:25.324 --> 35:28.260
And assuming it was made
overseas because of the case,

35:28.294 --> 35:31.263
I asked DHS to swab the sub
for HMX residue, too.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.931
The inside's covered
with this stuff.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.267
So they were smuggling
in explosives.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.269
If so, a sub that size
could have had

35:37.303 --> 35:40.239
hundreds of pounds on it,
maybe more.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.907
Question is,
who's got it now?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.742
PATTON: Whoever the agents
were working for.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.878
Only explanation.
Problem is

35:46.912 --> 35:49.215
I can't come up with
a name because I can't

35:49.248 --> 35:50.882
decrypt the agents' cell
or his computer.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.451
I thought you could
decrypt anything

35:52.484 --> 35:53.919
Yeah.
Believe me,

35:53.952 --> 35:55.321
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.190
But this thing
is NSA-level lockbox.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.758
Pride, if they
weren't bad guys,

35:59.791 --> 36:01.860
I'd be impressed.
But I can tell you this--

36:01.893 --> 36:03.529
whoever they're
communicating with,

36:03.562 --> 36:05.297
he's somewhere in New Orleans.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.267
Yeah, with enough explosive
power to level a city block.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.869
Guess we know why DHS
opened their office here.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.738
The problem is

36:12.771 --> 36:14.873
nobody knows
what the target is,

36:14.906 --> 36:16.442
or even if it's local.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.444
Keep working, would you?

36:18.477 --> 36:19.545
So what's
our next move?

36:19.578 --> 36:20.746
Hope DHS and Russo

36:20.779 --> 36:22.348
get answers
out of Judy Brown.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.316
While we do what, sit
around and do nothing?

36:24.350 --> 36:26.918
I've contacted
DEA, FBI and ATF.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.388
All right?
Lasalle's looping in NOPD.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.490
We need some kind of lead.
I don't care

36:31.523 --> 36:34.693
where it comes from as long
as we find those explosives.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.503
It's a little eerie,
isn't it?

36:44.536 --> 36:46.405
Just sitting here,
waiting.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.707
It's more like
frustrating and unnerving.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.344
Christopher,
what if we don't find these...

36:52.378 --> 36:53.412
We will.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.014
All right? And we have to.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.016
Now, you didn't get me
a light beer, did you?

36:58.049 --> 37:01.320
You know
I know you better than that.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.989
Hey, where's
your other other half?

37:04.022 --> 37:06.692
Brody draw the short straw,
get paperwork duty?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.294
Nah. I bet ten bucks

37:08.327 --> 37:10.496
she's cozying up
with the new DC boo,

37:10.529 --> 37:11.597
Russo.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.465
Yeah, hero always gets the girl.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.033
Hey, I will drink to that.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.337
Excuse me.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.373
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.974
We got to get back
on the manager hunt

37:23.008 --> 37:24.976
so you don't have to be
doing all of this.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.313
So... you buy ten,
you get one free,

37:27.346 --> 37:28.580
so I ordered 11 cases.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.449
Nice.
Also, I grouped
the taps

37:30.482 --> 37:32.318
together so we're not
running into each other

37:32.351 --> 37:33.319
pouring different brews

37:33.352 --> 37:34.386
and... oh, I found

37:34.420 --> 37:35.721
the source of those brownouts.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.988
No way.
Yes.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.524
Back bar cooler's got a short.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.758
I'll fix it.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.294
Thanks, Buckley. Appreciate it.
Yep.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.732
Uh, you were saying?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.500
Oh, hell no.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.768
After all of that,

37:49.801 --> 37:50.936
you hired a guy who tried

37:50.969 --> 37:52.371
to blow your head off?

37:52.404 --> 37:53.772
What's his
qualification?

37:53.805 --> 37:56.074
Served our country,
he can serve in a bar.

37:56.107 --> 38:00.045
Plus, his daddy had a restaurant
when he was growing up.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.548
He knows his way around.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.783
You have
got to be kidding me.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.685
Fellas, here you go.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.987
You sure this ain't you
just being a softie?

38:09.020 --> 38:11.056
Man deserves a break,
too, all right?

38:11.089 --> 38:13.425
You guys good?
Besides, Buckley's got

38:13.459 --> 38:15.627
skin in the game, too.
He knows this is a chance

38:15.661 --> 38:17.496
to get his life back on track,

38:17.529 --> 38:21.333
and I don't think he's gonna
let either one of us down.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.568
Did I mention...

38:22.601 --> 38:24.603
he plays a mean banjo.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.007
I still prefer Camille.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.387
You said you wouldn't mind
having a drink with me,

38:41.420 --> 38:43.855
so here I am.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.057
New Orleans
sure is a friendly place.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.927
Coffee mugs.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.429
Perfect.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.833
So...

38:54.866 --> 38:56.535
what are we drinking to?

38:56.568 --> 38:58.036
Don't say saving your life.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.605
That's too easy.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.707
Sorry, that's all I've got.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.975
Is it?

39:04.009 --> 39:06.111
Um...

39:06.144 --> 39:10.015
how about
to joint investigations?

39:41.647 --> 39:42.881
Stop?

39:42.914 --> 39:45.383
No.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.536
Agent Russo.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.572
Now?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.808
I'll be right there.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.945
Judy Brown's ready to talk.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.914
Go. She might
be able to tell you

40:15.947 --> 40:18.083
who has the explosives. Go.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.196
I'll call you later.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.565
Text me.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.648
I am not going to talk.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.234
You weren't
supposed to get caught.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.806
You jeopardized the mission.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.515
Wait, you're...

41:23.549 --> 41:26.051
our contact?

41:37.896 --> 41:40.699
You know what you have to do.
