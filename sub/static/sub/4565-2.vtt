00:10.277 --> 00:11.744
( clicking )

00:11.746 --> 00:13.746
Talk to him.

00:13.748 --> 00:16.548
Why?  We have a great
text relationship.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.750
You know what's a better
text relationship?

00:17.752 --> 00:20.352
- What?
- Talk to him.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.429
<i>( phone swooshing )</i>

00:33.266 --> 00:34.867
He's right over there.

00:36.770 --> 00:37.770
No!

00:37.772 --> 00:39.772
Too complicated over there.

00:39.774 --> 00:44.410
The only thing
that can go wrong over here
is if I go over there.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.886
( sniffing )

01:33.860 --> 01:35.861
- How'd I do?
- You smelled him.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.398
- Yup.
- You smelled him
is what you did.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.402
I walk through life
the way I walk through life.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.337
Can we please talk about this?

01:45.339 --> 01:46.839

02:47.368 --> 02:49.801
It's like you can't
exist without these.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.738
<i>You use emoticons</i>
<i>rather than emotions.</i>

02:52.740 --> 02:56.708
You're an unfeeling generation

( mimicking zombies )

03:01.614 --> 03:02.714
Stop eating her.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.488
- You're late, miss myzell.
- My goldfish died.

03:10.890 --> 03:11.890
You see?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.425
This is what I'm
talking about.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.826
Miss myzell
has clearly

03:14.828 --> 03:16.528
Suffered
a tragic loss.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.829
Yet she does not
seem in touch

03:17.831 --> 03:19.097
With her
actual emotions.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.933
'scuze me?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.968
I am crying my eyes out.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.904
I'm gonna have to
leave class early.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.510
Oh, she actually made it
out the door this time.

03:31.512 --> 03:35.714
I actually made it
out the door this time!

03:37.150 --> 03:40.152
Dad, adjust and deal.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.754
Cellphones have been around
for, like, ever.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.390
It'll amaze you to know
that there was a whole world

03:45.392 --> 03:47.459
Before you and cellphones.

03:47.461 --> 03:51.597
And it'll amaze you to know
that I have 394 friends in here.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.132
And I'm amazed
that you believe that.

03:57.437 --> 04:01.039
This is a timeline
of all human existence.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.744
Starting here is everyone
who ever lived,

04:05.746 --> 04:10.148
Laughed, loved,
and understood
the value of life.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.684
The cellphone era,
which begins

04:12.686 --> 04:14.820
Right around here

04:14.822 --> 04:17.189
Pretty much destroys
all of that.

04:17.191 --> 04:19.191
Way to go, you.

04:19.193 --> 04:22.694
Sir, if I may take
a different position?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.830
Yeah, save me, mr. Friar.
Do I go too far?

04:24.832 --> 04:25.831
Always, sir.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.002
I understand your point,
but I use my phone

04:30.004 --> 04:31.670
To video chat
my old friends

04:31.672 --> 04:33.705
And to find out
what's going on in texas.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.774
Yeah.
How else can he keep tabs

04:35.776 --> 04:38.577
On all the hoedowns
and cattle pageants?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.512
- Maya!
- It's okay, riley.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.048
I'm unaffected by maya's views
of country life.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.183
As my uncle buster
always says,

04:45.185 --> 04:48.453
"be like an eagle
and soar above the mockingbird."

04:48.455 --> 04:49.788
You're the mockingbird.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.923
I know.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.526
It kills me
that I can't get to you.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.828
Sorry, ma'am.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.964
( angrily )
ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.067
- Farkle time, sir?
- Oh, I love farkle time.

05:05.539 --> 05:10.609
What's important
to our generation will be
on this side of the timeline,

05:10.611 --> 05:13.245
When farkle
and technology rule.

05:13.247 --> 05:16.915
And I will easily be able
to make another one of you...

05:16.917 --> 05:18.050
- Ow.
- ...And another one of you.

05:18.052 --> 05:23.555
Wait, so now there's four
of us and one of you?

05:23.557 --> 05:24.990
That's awesome.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.926
The future--
you can't escape it.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.895
I am farkle!

05:31.798 --> 05:34.900
The assignment--
you can't escape it.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.201
I am teacher!

05:37.838 --> 05:41.973
We're going to split into teams
and discover whether or not

05:41.975 --> 05:44.910
New technology
has made us better people.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.079
<i>You'll do presentations</i>
<i>on your findings.</i>

05:47.081 --> 05:49.815
And here's a twist--
no computers.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.882
What?!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.918
We're going old school.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.854
You're going to do your research
at the new york public library.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.556
Where?!

05:57.558 --> 06:00.092
And here's another twist
because I trust you not at all--

06:00.094 --> 06:01.693
Give me your cellphones.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.161
- No!
- Yeah.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.297
- ( all grumbling )
- come on, hand 'em up,
hand 'em up.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.998
( grumbling continues )

06:07.000 --> 06:08.834
Thank you, thank you.

06:08.836 --> 06:12.104
Okay, so our teams
for this assignment--

06:12.106 --> 06:15.640
- Maya--
- what up!

06:15.642 --> 06:17.809
And riley,

06:17.811 --> 06:21.113
You will be with-- no!

06:22.248 --> 06:24.082
- No.
-  <i>( bell ringing )</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.150
No!

06:27.253 --> 06:30.155
Why did you
have to come here?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.957
Sorry I make you uneasy, sir.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.960
Oh, dad,
we don't even have our phones.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.895
I mean,
what could possibly happen?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.603
Hey, soaring eagle,
you walkin' with us
to the library tonight?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.605
Sure, if that's good
with you guys.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.242
Well, seeing as how
you're riley's partner
on this assignment,

06:50.244 --> 06:52.811
I guess we should find out
if it's okay with her.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.746
Riley?

06:56.883 --> 06:58.817
Riley, any thoughts on this

06:58.819 --> 07:01.386
That might come
out of your mouth in word form?

07:01.388 --> 07:03.889
No, because you don't
have your phone anymore,

07:03.891 --> 07:07.259
So what are you going to do
to communicate?  I wonder.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.362
Oh, look at that.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.863
Two thumbs up from riley.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.800
<i>And a smiley face.</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:23.942
It was a good day.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.112
And then my friends
treated me nicely.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.880
And then my teacher
measured us

07:28.882 --> 07:30.215
And then I'm growing.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.985
And then jenny lewis
loves me...

07:34.887 --> 07:37.255
I think because I'm growing.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.325
It wasn't a good day.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.828
And then my friend
pulled my hair out.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.797
And then my teacher
took my phone away

07:45.799 --> 07:49.734
And then my teacher
was also my father.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.338
At least you're growing.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.340
Topanga:
Honey, please don't come apart.

07:55.342 --> 07:59.010
Look at this
as a beautiful opportunity
to spend time with your family.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.783
Hello, riley.

08:04.785 --> 08:08.220
Want to hear about my day?
It was a good day.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.688
Mom!

08:09.690 --> 08:11.790
Forgive her, auggie.
She misses her telephone.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.325
Well, then she can have mine.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.228
( play phone beeps )
the cow goes...

08:16.230 --> 08:18.263
"moo!"

08:19.832 --> 08:21.066
I'm not gonna make it.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.334
That's what
your father thinks.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.869
She can't.

08:23.871 --> 08:27.706
It's no good for any of us
when your father is right.

08:28.774 --> 08:29.975
She's right.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.945
Why are you really doing this?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.916
Because I want
you and your friends
to become human beings.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.918
And I believe
that by doing this,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.953
You guys can learn
to become real human beings.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.789
- ( buzzes )
-  <i>hey, losers, it's maya.</i>

08:44.791 --> 08:46.391
Except her.

08:46.393 --> 08:50.028
You know what?
I am going to do this.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.431
I can get through
this whole thing

08:53.433 --> 08:56.034
Without making a text
or a call.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.270
- ( buzzes )
- come on up.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.105
Of course you can, sweetheart.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.241
And you know what?
You're already a wonderful
human being.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.876
But every so often,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.112
- Little tests like this
are gonna come up.
- Why?

09:07.114 --> 09:10.749
Because it's your father's job
to give you little tests.

09:10.751 --> 09:14.452
You guys are going
to learn a little bit more
about yourselves.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.321
-    <i>( door opens )</i>
<i>- maya: </i> <i>Yeah, like I've learned</i>

09:16.323 --> 09:19.124
That I'm actually really okay
with all of this.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.127
- You don't miss your phone?
- I was the only one in class
without a smart phone anyway.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.029
And now I kind of feel
like everybody's even.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.997
-  <i>( door buzzing )</i>
<i>- </i> <i>farkle.</i>

09:25.999 --> 09:27.265
Be ready in a minute.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.400
-    <i>( buzzing )</i>
<i>- </i> <i>and lucas.</i>

09:28.402 --> 09:30.101
Ready now!

09:33.940 --> 09:35.473
Did you see that?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.142
You know what that was?

09:37.144 --> 09:39.511
That was boys.
Too soon for boys.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.446
Not ready for boys.
I don't want boys.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.381
We just gonna accept boys?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.850
It happened, she's gone.
She was nice, we had fun,

09:45.852 --> 09:47.218
But we still have him.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.054
- You want to color?
- Color!

09:49.056 --> 09:52.023
Of course you do.
Let's color for the rest
of our lives.

09:57.063 --> 10:00.498
- Will I be getting
a real cellphone someday?
- Someday.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.335
Dominic falcone
has a real cellphone.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.337
Would you rather
have a real cellphone

10:05.339 --> 10:08.006
Or would you rather
color with us?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.341
Color with you.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.078
Does that get me a cellphone?

10:14.180 --> 10:15.847
Not too much longer
with this one either.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.215
Well, you'll always have me.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.950
( inhales sharply ) yeah.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.795
What is this place?

10:30.797 --> 10:34.933
This is where the ancients
stored all of their wisdom.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.935
- Look at all of those...
- Books.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.504
Both:
Books.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.972
Look.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.308
( blows )

10:43.310 --> 10:45.977
"tales of human interaction."

10:45.979 --> 10:47.812
We'll take it.
Thanks, quickdraw.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.181
Farkle, do whatever you do
with that.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.883
You mean read?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.518
- "chapter one--"
- oh, I'm bored out of my mind.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.953
Let's go to a movie.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.589
- Shh!
- All: Ah!

10:57.591 --> 11:00.358
There's one
of those ancients now.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.965
Oh, wondrous gatekeeper
of the knowledge,

11:06.967 --> 11:09.234
We are travelers
from another time and place.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.103
Seventh grade
middle school.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.106
We wish to partake
of this information

11:15.108 --> 11:16.875
From your great hall
of wisdom.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.377
- Do you rent phones?
- Shh!

11:19.379 --> 11:21.379
- There's no one here but us.
- Why do we have to shush?

11:21.381 --> 11:22.947
Let me handle this, maya.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.316
She obviously likes it quiet.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.254
Hello, book lady.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.290
Well, hello.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.925
And who might you be?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.860
I might be farkle.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.163
Would you do me a favor,
farkle?

11:38.165 --> 11:40.865
Oh, you know I will.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.968
Why don't you
go over there

11:43.970 --> 11:46.905
And... Shh!

11:46.907 --> 11:48.239
Well, that's disappointing.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.647
So...

11:55.649 --> 11:58.016
Yeah.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.119
Uh-huh.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.421
This chapter is called
"disconnect to connect."

12:03.423 --> 12:06.891
"not until
we put down our phones,
switch off our computers

12:06.893 --> 12:10.261
Will we be able
to touch each other's hearts."

12:10.263 --> 12:12.464
Yeah, like that's going
to work on anybody.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.043
People used to need
places like this.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.645
Now we can hold everything
that's here in a little device
we can put in our pockets.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.447
I don't even need
to look out this window

12:29.449 --> 12:31.583
To know
what phase the moon is in
or where the stars are.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.485
Yeah, well,
I don't have a phone like that.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.286
I just have
the actual sky.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.155
Oh, I'm so sorry for you.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.690
You're at a real disadvantage.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.658
That can be the basis
of our presentation, okay?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.127
Want to read back the notes?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.295
- What notes?
- You weren't taking notes?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.097
- No.
- You know, why bother?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.299
Without a computer,
all we have is a pencil
and a pad.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.635
What could we
possibly do with that?

12:52.371 --> 12:56.374
Maya, I had no idea.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.446
Yeah, neither did I.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.552
My dad thinks
that we have no idea
how to talk to each other.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.187
What if he's right?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.288
Shh!

13:10.290 --> 13:12.190
But we're not saying anything.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.658
I know.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.660
Then why are you shushing us?

13:15.662 --> 13:17.128
Because I can't take it anymore.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.330
You guys are hopeless.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.698
Come here.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.669
Couple of sweet kids like you

13:24.671 --> 13:27.305
And you sit there
like a couple of lumps.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.973
You're a disgrace

13:28.975 --> 13:31.743
To every single story
on these shelves.

13:31.745 --> 13:35.613
- Okay, so what do I say to him?
- Look around.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.650
Nothing here but books
about boys and girls

13:38.652 --> 13:41.152
And men and women
and what they say to each other.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.989
Open any one of them and you--
no, not that one.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.991
Oh, boy, not that one!

13:46.993 --> 13:52.030
Look, all these books
have one thing in common.

13:52.032 --> 13:56.000
You start on page one,
and each page you turn

13:56.002 --> 13:57.569
Brings you deeper
into the story.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.204
- What's your name?
- Riley.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.539
- What's his name?
-  <i>Lucas.</i>

14:01.541 --> 14:03.241
You like a good story, riley?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.476
Then start at the beginning.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.620
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.362
"because it's not until
you really looked at each other

14:24.364 --> 14:28.066
And made a human connection
that you can even begin
to know each other."

14:28.068 --> 14:29.801
- Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
- No.  No.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.669
- Look in my eyes.
- No!

14:33.072 --> 14:35.073
I guess the thing
I miss most about texas

14:35.075 --> 14:36.608
Are the pets
I used to have.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.210
I had a hamster.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.045
I had 24 horses.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.114
You win.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.717
Tell me about them.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.252
One day after school,

14:47.254 --> 14:49.053
Sofia was foaling.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.523
That means she was
giving birth, right?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.192
Not too bad,
city girl.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.460
( laughs )

14:55.462 --> 14:56.761
And there was no one there,

14:56.763 --> 14:59.197
So I called dr. Galendo

14:59.199 --> 15:01.199
And he talked me through it.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.202
Anyway, that was all.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.804
More.

15:06.806 --> 15:11.676
Did you know that a baby horse
stands in the first hour
after it's born?

15:11.678 --> 15:12.810
Really?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.812
I'd liked to have
been there for that.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.681
The coolest thing
I've ever seen

15:16.683 --> 15:19.150
And I was a part of it.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.588
- Riley.
- Lucas.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.190
I've never told this
to anybody before.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.193
Yeah?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.796
I think someday I might like
to be a veterinarian.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.766
That's cool too.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.101
I delivered
this beautiful palomino.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.838
I'd show you her picture,
but I don't have my phone.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.608
That's okay.
Just... ( sighs )

15:43.610 --> 15:45.176
Keep talking.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.784
"there is no connection
you can make with any screen

15:52.786 --> 15:54.752
That compares to the moment
you understand

15:54.754 --> 15:56.888
Only human beings
have souls."

15:56.890 --> 15:59.524
( no discernable dialog )

15:59.526 --> 16:00.692
- I have a soul.
- No.

16:00.694 --> 16:01.893
- I do!  I do!
- No.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.928
No.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.834
- I colored a new picture.
- Stay like this forever.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.403
Would you please?
That'd be great.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.806
The picture's over there.

16:16.675 --> 16:20.278
Mommy, daddy, auggie,
and no riley.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.647
Uh, auggie,
I don't know if you--

16:22.649 --> 16:27.285
I think that's
what you're supposed to do.
I have no idea.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.387
And look at the 'frigerator.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.621
The new one?

16:32.691 --> 16:34.792
That's our trip
to the jersey shore.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.261
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.330
I think that's what
you're supposed to do.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.276
How was your night, riley?

16:52.278 --> 16:55.747
Thank you for sending us
to the library.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.582
Really?

16:57.584 --> 17:00.918
Yes.
Lucas and I did really well
on the assignment.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.855
I think that we connected.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.723
What do you mean, connected?
What are you talking about?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.859
How did you connect?

17:07.861 --> 17:10.862
We talked about stuff
that was important to us--

17:10.864 --> 17:12.897
Too important to text.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.235
Did you know that
when you listen to someone,

17:17.237 --> 17:18.803
They'll tell you stuff?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.509
Oh, boy.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.310
Friends talk to each other,

17:26.312 --> 17:29.547
But real friends listen.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.816
Maya knows how to draw

17:31.818 --> 17:34.752
And I know how to be
a real friend.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.722
You're a good teacher, dad.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.992
You can keep my phone
as long as you want.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.903
- Congratulations, cory.
- What did I do?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.305
You just taught our daughter
how to feel.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.274
- I did that?
- You did.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.809
I didn't mean to do that.

17:57.811 --> 17:58.743
Well, you did.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.977
She has feelings now?

17:59.979 --> 18:01.712
- Mm-hmm.
- How many?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.781
- All of them.
- Well, put them back.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.916
We can't do that.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.684
I have a way.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.420
- There's no way.
- I have a way.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.823
Here you go-- take your phone.
Take it now.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.791
Very good.
Here's your phone.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.461
Good, great,
nobody talks to nobody.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.729
No more feelings.
Thank you.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.834
Okay, guys,
the great technology debate.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.035
Let's boot it up!

18:27.840 --> 18:30.475
I have always believed
technology would help us

18:30.477 --> 18:32.543
Fulfill our potential
as a species.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.545
And when farkle
does rule the world,

18:34.547 --> 18:37.048
No matter what devices
we come up with,

18:37.050 --> 18:39.350
We should also never forget
what we can do with a pencil,

18:39.352 --> 18:43.421
A piece of paper
and our own imaginations.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.760
I've been keeping this
in my pocket where my phone
used to be.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.330
I keep looking at it.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.834
I'm fine.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.002
Thanks, farkle.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.871
- Look in my eyes.
- No.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.475
I thought my whole life
was in my phone,

19:04.477 --> 19:08.446
But it turns out
that I don't really have
any friends in here.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.014
And you don't
need your phone

19:10.016 --> 19:11.983
To connect
with your real friends.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.386
Allow us to demonstrate.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.857
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.863
<i>♪ I'm singing "go-o-o"</i>

19:32.538 --> 19:34.906
Maya:
I'm not that tall.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.043
Really?

19:41.079 --> 19:44.882
How you doin'?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.985
You will keep an eye on riley
at all times.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.754
You will send me
message alerts.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.055
You will send me pictures.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.057
You're really scared,
aren't you?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.359
I'm a father.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.595
Yeah.
They're just friends.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.997
Believe me,
I know the story.

19:59.999 --> 20:03.100
But you're forgetting,
I don't have the technology.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.037
Now you do.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.848
You got me a phone?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.985
My motives
are completely selfish.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.487
I'm not sure they are,
mr. Matthews.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.090
Well, I also
got you these.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.895
- Colored pencils?
- Yeah.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.697
You let me know
everything

20:32.699 --> 20:34.031
That's going on
with riley.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.467
And if something
beautiful ever
happens,

20:36.469 --> 20:38.569
Paint me
a picture.
