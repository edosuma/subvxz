(ominous music)

00:50.516 --> 00:53.360
(man moaning)

00:53.360 --> 00:55.960
- You should have killed
me when you had the chance.

(gun firing)

01:07.191 --> 01:10.120

01:10.120 --> 01:11.093
Nice design.

I am good.

(upbeat drumming)

01:50.458 --> 01:53.125
(ominous music)

02:00.180 --> 02:02.253
- It's gettin' late, Charles,
you really should go.

02:02.253 --> 02:03.770
- Just do your job, mind your business,

02:03.770 --> 02:04.970
and keep 'em comin'.

02:10.823 --> 02:13.073

02:47.710 --> 02:48.753
Stop calling me!

02:50.009 --> 02:53.009

03:26.368 --> 03:28.535
(panting)

03:30.496 --> 03:31.329
- Wait up.

03:31.329 --> 03:32.363
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:32.363 --> 03:34.228
- Oh come on, Charles, let's go, man.

03:34.228 --> 03:35.331
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
- Keep up, let's go.

03:35.331 --> 03:36.890
- Hold on, hold on.
- What's the problem?

03:36.890 --> 03:37.723
- No problem.

03:39.130 --> 03:40.112
She's playing hard to get.

03:40.112 --> 03:41.020
- Oh my God, no, no, no, no, no.

03:41.020 --> 03:41.960
Let that go, Charles, a'ight?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.430
I'm surprised she ain't
put a restraining order

03:43.430 --> 03:44.263
on your ass.

03:44.263 --> 03:46.400
- Exactly, that's my point,
no restraining order.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.233
She's playing hard to get.

03:47.233 --> 03:49.170
- No, no, no--
- I'm gonna win her back.

03:49.170 --> 03:50.690
- After all that?

03:50.690 --> 03:52.160
- I forgave her.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.210
I forgave her.

03:53.210 --> 03:54.347
She's playing hard to get.

03:54.347 --> 03:55.180
- Hey, hey, hey, look,
we got two more miles.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.070
A'ight, come on, let's go.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.463
- I'm gonna win her back.

04:08.197 --> 04:09.362
(beeping)

04:09.362 --> 04:10.922
Come on!

04:10.922 --> 04:12.755
Is your internet slow?

04:12.755 --> 04:13.588
- No.

04:14.817 --> 04:16.983
(sighing)

04:20.029 --> 04:20.938
Come on!

04:20.938 --> 04:22.598
What is it?

04:22.598 --> 04:23.431
What?

04:23.431 --> 04:24.264
What are you lookin' at?

04:59.770 --> 05:00.970
It's okay, it's okay.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.640
No reason for alarm here.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.260
Let me explain, please.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.093
It's fine.

05:05.093 --> 05:07.410
- We have nothing to discus, Charles.

05:07.410 --> 05:08.243
You're embarrassing me.

05:08.243 --> 05:09.130
You need to leave.

05:09.130 --> 05:10.230
- Yes, Jessica, leave us alone.

05:10.230 --> 05:11.063
Mary, beat it.

05:11.063 --> 05:12.990
- You need to beat it, Charles.

05:12.990 --> 05:15.070
- What's this thing still doing here?

05:15.070 --> 05:16.230
- Nah, I can handle it.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.440
I'll see you at the car.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.930
- Are you sure?
- She's sure, she's fine.

05:18.930 --> 05:19.763
Thank you.

05:19.763 --> 05:20.663
She's fine.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.553
Bye-bye.

05:24.780 --> 05:25.613
Okay.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.453
I forgive you.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.400
- You forgive me.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.640
Are you hearing yourself?

05:34.640 --> 05:37.510
You need medical attention, Charles.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.423
You need to stop bothering me.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.250
- I'm bothering you.
- Yeah.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.250
- I'm bothering you.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.673
You took everything from me,

05:49.613 --> 05:53.870
(laughing) my house, my cars,
everything, Clara, everything.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.917
And I forgave you.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.370
- You need to get out of my face.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.420
I've had it with you.

06:02.420 --> 06:03.790
And you need to learn to keep your dick

06:03.790 --> 06:06.456
inside your pants, or
should I call the cops?

06:06.456 --> 06:08.214
(thwacking)
(grunting)

06:08.214 --> 06:10.600
(Charles coughing)

06:10.600 --> 06:12.160
- Oh, you stupid whore!

06:12.160 --> 06:13.310
No, no, no, no, no, no!

06:19.790 --> 06:20.913
- Car's ready, boss.

06:30.969 --> 06:33.969

(gun clicking)

07:08.570 --> 07:10.840
- What do you want?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.853
- Smith awaits you downstairs.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.410
- How did you find this place?

07:20.410 --> 07:22.320
- Stop asking questions.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.487
Smith hates waitin'.

07:39.220 --> 07:42.090
- And how do I know
you're tellin' the truth?

07:42.090 --> 07:44.423
- You can find out the hard way.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.840
It's your choice.

07:50.998 --> 07:52.810
Hey!

07:52.810 --> 07:53.643
Hurry up!

07:57.424 --> 08:00.091
(ominous music)

08:12.210 --> 08:13.043
- Get in.

08:13.043 --> 08:13.880
- I'm comfortable right here.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.437
- Get in before I make an example of you.

08:19.239 --> 08:20.780
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:20.780 --> 08:21.613
I'll pay.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.353
I will pay.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.169
Hey, hey, hey, come on, man, relax.

08:28.169 --> 08:29.002
Okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.767
Please, give me some time.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.659
I will pay you.

08:38.659 --> 08:39.750
- [Smith] Drive.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.350
- [Steven] Look, my sister
is sick in the hospital.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.330
She needs medical attention.

08:45.330 --> 08:46.270
- [Smith] I know everything that goes on

08:46.270 --> 08:47.320
in this town, Steven.

08:48.330 --> 08:49.780
- What are you talking about?

08:50.740 --> 08:52.330
- Don't lie to me.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.930
Don't act like you don't know.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.710
Don't play games with me.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.963
I will put a bullet in
you right here, right now.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.140
I hate liars, Steven.

09:02.140 --> 09:03.017
- I'm not lyin'.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.050
- Scumbag, scumbag gambler!

09:09.050 --> 09:10.010
- I almost had it.

09:10.010 --> 09:11.920
If I had won that game, I
would've had enough money

09:11.920 --> 09:13.270
to take care of everything.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.900
- You took your sister's hospital money

09:16.900 --> 09:19.170
and you gambled that away.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.730
You're in to me plus 20 now

09:20.730 --> 09:23.380
for a half a million dollars,
do you understand that?

09:24.750 --> 09:28.346
Steven, you got 24 hours to give it to me,

09:28.346 --> 09:30.560
24 hours to make good on it.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.560
If not, you and your sister expire.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.093
Are we clear?

09:39.870 --> 09:40.703
- Yeah.

09:42.630 --> 09:45.520
- I would expect a little
bit more respect than that.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.163
Let's try it one more time.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.623
Are we clear?

09:52.330 --> 09:53.640
- Yes, sir.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.473
- Good boy.

09:54.473 --> 09:56.499
Get out of my vehicle.

09:56.499 --> 09:58.332
I have business to do.

10:02.423 --> 10:05.423
(suspenseful music)

10:09.378 --> 10:12.045
(phone beeping)

10:15.044 --> 10:17.400
(phone ringing)

10:17.400 --> 10:18.450
- I'll meet with you.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.877
- I know this goes without saying,

10:30.877 --> 10:33.293
but I would like this done quietly.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.193
What?

10:37.070 --> 10:40.250
- Have you thought about
this really carefully?

10:40.250 --> 10:43.143
- I pay you, you do the
job, no questions asked.

10:45.780 --> 10:47.030
- You got this all wrong, mister.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.400
I don't do random.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.120
I kill with a purpose.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.153
I get rid of society's worst nightmares.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.463
- This'll be right up your alley.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.033
You have no idea who she is.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.850
She stole my house, she took all my money.

11:00.850 --> 11:05.480
Look, she did child
porn, drug trafficking,

11:05.480 --> 11:07.240
all the bad stuff.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.720
You have no idea.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.890
She's bad.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.960
Don't let the face fool
ya, dude, she's bad.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.290
- What's she look like?

11:13.290 --> 11:15.070
- Good, here we go.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.300
Here.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.960
In here, address, all
the information you need.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.793
Here, here.

11:29.630 --> 11:31.282
- Interesting.

11:31.282 --> 11:32.700
- Here you go.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.000
Here.

11:34.000 --> 11:34.833
Ta-da.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.850
- What is this?

11:37.850 --> 11:38.683
- It's vitamins.

11:38.683 --> 11:39.610
I don't want her to catch a cold.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.610
Poison, genius, what do you think it is?

11:42.530 --> 11:44.480
- You suck at being sarcastic.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.313
- Look, you use anything else

11:45.313 --> 11:47.160
and it could point back
to me as a suspect.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.710
I wanna keep this as quiet as possible.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.720
- I heard that part.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.023
- Yeah, I wanna it kept quiet, I know.

11:53.870 --> 11:57.556
- I want double and I
want everything right now.

11:57.556 --> 11:59.580
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.810
We agreed, we agreed half
now, half when it's done.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.530
That was the agreement.

12:04.530 --> 12:05.863
- Only if I do it my way.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.890
- God damn it!

12:11.270 --> 12:13.440
Fine, fine.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.200
She gets coffee everyday, 7:00pm-ish.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.470
Might be a good time to do whatever it is

12:17.470 --> 12:19.010
you're gonna do.

12:19.010 --> 12:20.763
- Is there anything else I need to know?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.200
- Not that I can think of.

12:29.152 --> 12:31.770
The combination is 69-69.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.570
It's her favorite number, of course.

12:36.160 --> 12:36.993
Good?

12:36.993 --> 12:37.863
- We're good, yeah.

12:39.044 --> 12:39.877
- Here you go.

12:39.877 --> 12:41.413
- Thank you, I'll keep in touch.

12:45.792 --> 12:48.709
(insects chirping)

12:49.883 --> 12:52.800
(soft piano music)

12:55.501 --> 12:56.433
- Mm, that's good.

13:05.257 --> 13:08.257
(suspenseful music)

13:29.036 --> 13:32.203
(TV static crackling)

13:44.546 --> 13:47.463
(doorbell ringing)

13:54.060 --> 13:55.050
Cookies.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.760
- Sorry, I'm having a television issue.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.423
- Oh, that's a shame.

14:01.550 --> 14:05.410
Well, I see you haven't
been eatin' your cookies.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.623
- Ms. Nancy, you know I love your cookies.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.220
Um, you can stay for a
little while if you'd like.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.170
I'm just on the phone.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.910
- No, I've got a cake in the oven.

14:15.910 --> 14:17.140
My grandson, Cody,

14:17.140 --> 14:19.380
is going to be two years old this weekend.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.480
- Ooh!
- Can you believe that?

14:20.480 --> 14:21.380
- That's so cute.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.050
They grow up so quick.

14:23.050 --> 14:24.684
- They do, you have no idea.

14:24.684 --> 14:25.540
(Clara sighs)

14:25.540 --> 14:26.373
What's wrong?

14:26.373 --> 14:28.440
- They've hung up on me, like, four times.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.474
Yeah.

14:29.474 --> 14:30.930
- Ooh, well, I'll leave you to that, okay?

14:30.930 --> 14:31.763
- Thank you.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.958
Have a good night, Nancy.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.791
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

14:43.122 --> 14:45.789
(phone ringing)

14:46.993 --> 14:49.960
- This call may be monitored
for training purposes.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.380
My name is Aarush.

14:51.380 --> 14:54.200
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with today?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.970
- [Clara] Sir, I can't
get any signal on my TV.

14:56.970 --> 14:58.610
- [Aarush] Could you please
verify your telephone

- Thank you, Clara.

15:13.253 --> 15:15.600
How may I assist you today?

15:15.600 --> 15:19.903
- Dude, I literally just
said my TV's outta whack.

15:20.991 --> 15:23.580
- Ooh, I am sorry about that.

15:23.580 --> 15:24.800
Give me one second.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.960
Let me check for you.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.923
- Since when did they start
routing calls to India?

15:32.120 --> 15:33.623
- Give me one second, madame.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.320
- Okay, well can you hurry it up?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.023
I'm missing my TV show.

15:44.350 --> 15:45.183
- Madame?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.503
Clara, are you there?

15:48.503 --> 15:49.336
Clara?

15:49.336 --> 15:50.169
Madame?

15:50.169 --> 15:51.490
- Where else would I be?

15:51.490 --> 15:52.720
Did you hear me hang up?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.543
Can we just get someone
out here to fix this?

15:56.741 --> 15:58.191
- Give me one second, madame.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.820
Let me troubleshoot from my end first

16:01.820 --> 16:04.450
an then we will see what we can do, okay?

16:04.450 --> 16:06.570
- Okay, well get on it already.

16:06.570 --> 16:08.603
Don't tell me about it, just do it.

16:10.524 --> 16:12.400
(Clara groans)

16:12.400 --> 16:15.220
- Okay, it looks like I can
send out a technician tomorrow

16:15.220 --> 16:18.010
at 10:00am or 2:00pm.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.210
Does that work for you?

16:19.210 --> 16:20.870
- I work for a living, dude.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.220
- Okay, so should I put you down

16:22.220 --> 16:24.590
for 8:00am Saturday morning?

16:24.590 --> 16:25.520
- Whatever.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.630
I have to go.

16:26.630 --> 16:27.700
- Okay, great, Clara.

16:27.700 --> 16:31.750
I will put you down 8:00am
sharp Saturday morning.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.650
Somebody will knock on the door, okay?

16:34.730 --> 16:35.650
Thank you very much.

16:35.650 --> 16:36.700
You have a great day.

16:41.324 --> 16:44.324
(suspenseful music)

16:46.924 --> 16:50.639
(static crackling)

16:50.639 --> 16:53.556
(doorbell ringing)

17:03.893 --> 17:06.450
- Hi.
- Hi, um, cable problems?

17:06.450 --> 17:08.430
- The guy on the phone
said you weren't coming

17:08.430 --> 17:09.623
till later in the week.

17:10.839 --> 17:11.950
- I'm here to fix it.

17:11.950 --> 17:12.782
- Come on in.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.479
- Ooh. (Steven mumbles)

17:17.479 --> 17:21.896
Give me a second here, I'll
just get this on for you.

17:27.722 --> 17:28.620
Smells good in here.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.260
Is that Nigerian or Columbian?

17:31.260 --> 17:33.547
- You know your beans, huh?
- Yeah, I sure do.

17:33.547 --> 17:35.890
- (laughs) The living room's this way.

17:35.890 --> 17:38.210
Thank you so much for
caring about my carpet.

17:38.210 --> 17:39.670
No one ever does that.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.130
You think it'd be common courtesy.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.530
Cleaning carpet ain't cheap.

17:43.965 --> 17:46.965
(soft, eerie music)

17:55.806 --> 17:59.305
(TV static crackling)

17:59.305 --> 18:02.230
- Ma'am, I need to check
your cable box outside.

18:02.230 --> 18:03.453
- Okay, no worries.

18:35.718 --> 18:38.713
♪ Meet me in the garden of ♪

18:38.713 --> 18:42.463
(TV chattering indistinctly)

18:44.330 --> 18:45.510
Coffee?

18:45.510 --> 18:46.510
- [Steven] Uh, sure.

18:47.730 --> 18:48.580
Thank you.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.430
- You're welcome.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.260
- This is actually really good.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.260
- Columbian.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.490
I know my coffee too.

18:55.490 --> 18:57.370
- Oh, nice.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.890
Did you serve time?

18:58.890 --> 18:59.890
- 'Scuse me?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.070
- I mean military.

19:01.070 --> 19:05.220
- Oh, seven brutal years in the Corps.

19:05.220 --> 19:08.510
And then I was the frontline
nurse for two tours.

19:08.510 --> 19:09.343
Great times, though.

19:09.343 --> 19:11.350
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.350
- I'm sure your folks
must be really proud.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.923
- Um, my dad was.

19:15.774 --> 19:17.980
He died a couple years ago.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.393
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

19:19.393 --> 19:20.870
- It's okay.

19:20.870 --> 19:22.330
- Ma'am, um, you wanna
go check your channels?

19:22.330 --> 19:24.429
Just check on 'em, make
sure that they all work.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.429
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.434
(upbeat music)

19:33.434 --> 19:35.615
- [Actress] That's something
else we do very well.

19:35.615 --> 19:36.744
(TV clicking)

19:36.744 --> 19:39.471
- [Show Host] Come on down!
(applauding)

19:39.471 --> 19:41.229
(TV chattering indistinctly)

19:41.229 --> 19:43.894
- Check all your channels.
- Okay.

19:43.894 --> 19:46.061
- Make sure they all work.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.870
- I missed my show.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.150
- I'm sure they have reruns.

19:57.150 --> 19:58.340
Hey, here you go, here's your cup.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.960
- Thank you.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.770
- Is it okay if I finish
my coffee before I leave?

20:02.770 --> 20:04.470
- Yeah, that's fine, take your time.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.600
Have you ever seen this?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.870
- Seen what?
- This show.

20:07.870 --> 20:08.703
- No.

20:08.703 --> 20:10.510
- You've never seen it?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.957
Oh my God, did you see...

20:11.957 --> 20:13.407
- Oh, snap!
- I'm so sorry.

20:13.407 --> 20:15.176
- All right, let me get
you another cup of coffee,

20:15.176 --> 20:16.009
get you a rag and clean the floor, okay?

20:16.009 --> 20:18.663
- No, it's fine, I should
be going to bed anyway.

20:27.030 --> 20:28.780
What'd you say your name was again?

20:30.510 --> 20:32.470
- Sam Jones, call me Sam.

20:32.470 --> 20:35.363
- [Clara] Okay, great,
my name is Clara, okay?

20:36.460 --> 20:37.970
It was so nice to meet you.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.540
And if they call, I will give them

20:39.540 --> 20:41.670
a great review on you, okay?

20:41.670 --> 20:45.020
- Sure.
- All right. (laughs)

20:45.020 --> 20:47.910
Um, a drink sometime would be good.

20:47.910 --> 20:48.803
- 'Scuse me?

20:49.940 --> 20:51.080
- I don't mean to pressure you, Clara,

20:51.080 --> 20:53.070
but I think you're an incredible person.

20:53.070 --> 20:56.110
- Okay well, um, you're really direct.

20:56.110 --> 20:58.153
- I mean, just a drink,
makin' new friends,

20:58.153 --> 20:59.490
just a friendly gesture.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.510
- Look, I just got out
of a seven-year marriage

21:02.510 --> 21:03.550
with a psychopath.

21:03.550 --> 21:05.220
I'm not ready for anything like that.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.790
- I mean, just makin' new friends.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.170
That's the more reason
why you should come out,

21:09.170 --> 21:10.590
hang out and make new friends, you know?

21:10.590 --> 21:14.210
I mean, I don't bite people, I just--

21:14.210 --> 21:15.974
- I'll think about it.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.843
- Okay, all right, give me your number.

21:18.826 --> 21:21.743
(soft piano music)

21:29.043 --> 21:30.940
All right, thank you.

21:30.940 --> 21:31.780
- No problem.

21:31.780 --> 21:33.553
Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.870
- I was always in uniforms,

21:42.870 --> 21:47.560
so now I like to live through my outfits.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.583
And I wear a lotta color, and
my favorite color is blue.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.470
- Guess what my favorite color is?

21:52.470 --> 21:53.981
- Blue?
- Yeah.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.217
(laughing)

21:55.217 --> 21:56.367
I got blue all over me.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.672
- That's funny.
- Yeah, nice, nice.

21:59.672 --> 22:01.601
Let me get you some more wine here.

22:01.601 --> 22:02.601
- Thank you.

22:04.888 --> 22:05.941
- Good?
- Mm-hm.

22:05.941 --> 22:07.595
- Okay.

22:07.595 --> 22:10.650
(Steven mumbles)

22:10.650 --> 22:12.027
All right.

22:12.027 --> 22:13.490
Cheers to new friends.

22:13.490 --> 22:14.833
- To new friends for real.

22:18.320 --> 22:22.010
So, what is your story?

22:22.010 --> 22:26.560
You seem way too sophisticated
to be an average cable guy.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.030
- Honestly?

22:28.030 --> 22:29.053
Just pure curiosity.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.080
The whole broadband thing is amazing.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.040
The technology is amazing.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.233
My business is an NGO.

22:37.872 --> 22:39.455
- Um, what is that?

22:40.763 --> 22:43.150
- It's a non-governmental organization.

22:43.150 --> 22:45.750
We help firms determine
where goods and services

22:45.750 --> 22:48.810
are to be distributed to
third-world countries.

22:48.810 --> 22:52.410
Could be clothes, you
know, just basic amenities.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.453
- Superman, ready to save the world.

22:56.389 --> 22:57.783
- That's just who I am, you know.

22:57.783 --> 23:01.110
24 more hours, I retire, travel the world

23:01.110 --> 23:02.930
and enjoy the fruits of my labor.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.633
- That sounds hot.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.990
Excuse me, I need to
go to the ladies room.

23:08.990 --> 23:09.823
- Sure.

23:28.920 --> 23:29.917
- Water?

23:29.917 --> 23:30.834
- I'm good.

23:43.429 --> 23:45.114
(footsteps clacking)

23:45.114 --> 23:47.100
- I'm so sorry!

23:47.100 --> 23:47.933
My bad.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.190
- I am so sorry.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.863
This time it wasn't me.

23:52.863 --> 23:55.300
- Just go sit down, sit, sit, sit.

24:03.327 --> 24:05.970
You're like a walkin' rabbit foot, huh?

24:05.970 --> 24:07.013
- Come again?

24:07.870 --> 24:09.173
- Ah, nevermind.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.100
So what happened to your marriage?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.120
- Um...

24:16.120 --> 24:17.420
- Don't, you don't have to
say, don't worry about it.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.373
You're fine.
- No, it's okay.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.943
He cheated on me with my best friend.

24:26.410 --> 24:30.683
I can deal with a lot, but that, I can't.

24:32.056 --> 24:35.070
He's been trying to get
back with me ever since.

24:35.070 --> 24:36.707
Dude's a little crazy.

24:36.707 --> 24:38.510
(cork popping)

24:38.510 --> 24:41.030
- Why don't you get a
restraining order on him?

24:41.030 --> 24:42.970
- I can handle myself.

24:42.970 --> 24:43.950
I'm a big girl.

24:45.272 --> 24:46.510
- Okay.

24:46.510 --> 24:50.510
(gentle string and piano music)

25:55.040 --> 25:55.873
Oh, shit!

26:00.741 --> 26:01.574
Oh!

26:05.925 --> 26:08.967
Oooh. (clucking)

26:08.967 --> 26:12.967
(Steven muttering indistinctly)

26:14.674 --> 26:16.632
Hurry up, wake up, wake up.

26:16.632 --> 26:18.900
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.900
(suspenseful music)

26:27.310 --> 26:28.683
Clara, wake up, wake up.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.323
So dramatic.

26:38.470 --> 26:40.885
Get your bag, get you some
clothes, and let's go.

26:40.885 --> 26:42.823
I don't have time to explain, okay?

26:43.738 --> 26:46.570
Get your bag, get you some
clothes, and let's go.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.303
Come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

27:18.353 --> 27:20.038
Hurry, hurry, let's go.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.909
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:21.909 --> 27:22.742
Oooh!

27:26.900 --> 27:28.113
What happened to stealth?

27:30.338 --> 27:32.820
(Steven groaning)

27:32.820 --> 27:34.300
Hurry up, hurry, let's go.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.203
- I'm trying.

27:36.374 --> 27:37.393
Wha, what?

27:38.435 --> 27:39.268
Stealth?

27:40.264 --> 27:41.683
- I'm just thinking out loud.

27:54.330 --> 27:57.163
(Steven groaning)

28:00.346 --> 28:01.429
Don't, don't.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.103
- Who is that?

28:11.870 --> 28:13.553
What's going on, Jones?

28:15.090 --> 28:16.480
What is it?

28:16.480 --> 28:18.440
- Snap, I left my gun.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.970
- What?

28:19.970 --> 28:20.893
Your gun?

28:22.130 --> 28:25.370
- Look, I know I have a
lot of explaining to do.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.333
Now is not a good time.

28:27.333 --> 28:30.328
(ominous music)

28:30.328 --> 28:33.411
(door creaking open)

28:34.453 --> 28:36.993
- (laughs) Americans.

28:41.751 --> 28:44.418
(lock clicking)

28:48.930 --> 28:49.910
- What?

28:49.910 --> 28:51.590
- [Steven] You leave your front door open?

28:51.590 --> 28:54.420
- Yeah, it's a safe neighborhood, okay?

28:54.420 --> 28:56.000
Who is that?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.557
- That's an assassin, and he's
been sent here to kill us.

28:59.557 --> 29:00.430
- What?

29:00.430 --> 29:01.640
- Look, no time for this.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.490
Where's your gun?

29:05.980 --> 29:07.750
- I don't have any clips left.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.434
- Let me see it, let me see it.

29:09.434 --> 29:10.267
- No.

29:10.267 --> 29:13.123
My gun, my house, my show.

29:15.230 --> 29:18.290
- Okay, all right, this
is what's happening.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.140
My sist--
- Sorry for the intrusion.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.783
I only want Clara.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.290
Just send her down here
and I'll be out of here.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.890
- You have to tell me what's going on.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.053
- Okay.

29:38.669 --> 29:40.836
(humming)

29:51.732 --> 29:55.277
♪ America ♪

29:55.277 --> 29:59.080
♪ America ♪

29:59.080 --> 30:03.385
♪ America ♪

30:03.385 --> 30:07.244
♪ America ♪

30:07.244 --> 30:09.411
♪ America ♪

30:11.190 --> 30:13.043
You understand my English?

30:20.220 --> 30:21.980
- [Steven] What are, what are you doing?

30:21.980 --> 30:25.230
- I can't find my phone.
- Don't call the cops.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.880
- Why is that?

30:26.880 --> 30:27.713
- Trust me.

30:28.980 --> 30:30.580
- [Clara] Where's your phone at?

30:30.580 --> 30:31.413
- It's dead.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.246
- Convenient, huh?

30:35.500 --> 30:36.523
- Come down!

30:38.580 --> 30:41.510
Let me put two bullets in your head

30:41.510 --> 30:45.820
and call it a day, because
at the end of the day

30:46.680 --> 30:48.053
I will still kill you.

30:51.770 --> 30:53.323
Make it fast and easy.

30:58.570 --> 31:01.268
- [Clara] This is really
great, you know? (laughs)

31:01.268 --> 31:03.590
- You know, I didn't plan for any of this.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.833
- [Drummer] All that planning is nonsense.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.723
I've already surveyed the area.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.940
Your back doors are locked.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.021
I put traps behind your back windows,

31:15.021 --> 31:17.480
near the roof and on the ground.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.400
- Crap.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.900
- [Drummer] It's an explosion.

31:21.114 --> 31:24.069
- Oh, whatever.
- Please, make my life easy

31:24.069 --> 31:26.023
and go through any one of the window.

31:27.143 --> 31:28.140
(Steven grunts)

31:28.140 --> 31:29.503
Just do it now.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.800
- [Clara] I just painted it.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.893
It's stuck.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.730
- Really?
- Yep.

31:37.730 --> 31:38.785
- Great.

31:38.785 --> 31:41.785
(suspenseful music)

32:14.420 --> 32:15.420
- No snacks?

32:39.378 --> 32:42.211
(bottle clatters)

32:57.690 --> 33:02.690
My client wants your face
and body to still be fine,

33:03.830 --> 33:07.163
or else I would burn
this dump to the ground.

33:10.977 --> 33:11.810
Idiots.

33:20.039 --> 33:23.439
(dramatic music)

33:23.439 --> 33:26.356
(Drummer laughing)

33:28.237 --> 33:31.237
(breathing heavily)

33:37.121 --> 33:39.371
(laughing)

33:43.430 --> 33:44.263
Woo!

33:45.345 --> 33:48.095
(Clara coughing)

33:53.709 --> 33:55.597
You not gonna save her.

33:55.597 --> 33:57.264
I hear her coughing.

34:00.406 --> 34:05.373
- I'm out. (coughing)

34:16.295 --> 34:17.129
Here.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.500
- Come and grab the cash, Superman.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.900
Come grab the cash, Superman!

34:29.900 --> 34:33.253
(dramatic music)

34:33.253 --> 34:38.253
(gun firing)
(bullet ricocheting)

34:39.202 --> 34:42.342
(gun firing)

34:42.342 --> 34:43.175
- Yes!

35:09.545 --> 35:12.378
(gas can hissing)

35:14.124 --> 35:19.124
(gun firing)
(Steven shrieking)

35:20.070 --> 35:23.153
(somber piano music)

35:28.086 --> 35:30.919
(toilet flushing)

35:33.813 --> 35:35.603
Sport smokes, really?

35:36.930 --> 35:39.446
Sport smoke?

35:39.446 --> 35:42.413
I was expecting something
more tactical, like tear gas.

35:43.852 --> 35:44.852
Is that all you got?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.783
- I only want Clara.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.463
My client says you can keep the money.

35:53.930 --> 35:55.423
He won't come after you.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.980
(Drummer laughing)

35:59.980 --> 36:01.000
- Let me explain.

36:01.000 --> 36:01.963
- Client?

36:03.300 --> 36:04.672
- Charles sent me to clip you.

36:04.672 --> 36:06.114
- [Drummer] How do you like me now, huh?

36:06.114 --> 36:08.073
- Charles?
- But I didn't.

36:09.330 --> 36:10.980
- Yeah, right.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.233
You're playing me.

36:13.260 --> 36:14.497
- I'm not playing you.

36:15.595 --> 36:19.262
(Drummer breathing heavily)

36:26.944 --> 36:28.194
- [Clara] Here.

36:31.477 --> 36:34.923
(Drummer groaning)

36:34.923 --> 36:38.673
(Clara mutters indistinctly)

36:43.355 --> 36:44.188
- Ahhh!

36:51.808 --> 36:52.641
Hurry up.

36:53.890 --> 36:57.017
(Steven groans)

36:57.017 --> 36:58.683
Hand me that T-shirt.

37:04.171 --> 37:05.698
The scissors please.

37:05.698 --> 37:06.531
- Here.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.379
- Lighter.

37:10.379 --> 37:11.212
Lighter!

37:20.817 --> 37:23.234
(whimpering)

37:30.857 --> 37:33.190
(screaming)

38:01.473 --> 38:04.306
(Steven groaning)

38:06.257 --> 38:07.757
- I'm gonna wrap it now, okay?

38:10.467 --> 38:11.300
Ready?

38:19.160 --> 38:20.858
I'm gonna watch the door.

38:20.858 --> 38:22.108
- No, no, stay.

38:31.021 --> 38:34.021
(suspenseful music)

38:36.104 --> 38:40.187
(Drummer muttering indistinctly)

38:51.858 --> 38:54.330
(groaning)

38:54.330 --> 38:56.480
- You saved my life.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.313
Why?

38:59.550 --> 39:00.623
- You needed saving.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.810
Any other doors?

39:07.810 --> 39:08.643
- No.

39:10.865 --> 39:12.103
- (sighs) Perfect.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.633
- Charles sent you to
kill me, and you didn't.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.463
- Isn't it obvious?

39:39.785 --> 39:42.452
(ominous music)

39:47.363 --> 39:50.507
- I told him you must have
lost your touch or somethin'.

39:53.350 --> 39:56.893
Me, I told him I don't like poison.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.163
I like to shoot.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.373
I'm a professional killer.

40:05.988 --> 40:08.330
In Africa, we used to use poison.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.383
I don't try it from now on.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.573
It's too easy.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.543
I'm a natural shooter!

40:24.227 --> 40:26.477
(laughing)

40:30.700 --> 40:31.533
Woo!

40:32.775 --> 40:36.710
I promised I would not
shoot her in the face.

40:36.710 --> 40:38.823
In the face!

40:44.985 --> 40:48.485
- What are you looking for?
- My other gun.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.910
I left it in the garage.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.660
- [Drummer] This gun?

40:53.660 --> 40:55.283
Why didn't you use the poison?

41:01.740 --> 41:03.180
- [Clara] Hm?

41:03.180 --> 41:05.130
- You have every right to be mad at me.

41:06.490 --> 41:07.790
I genuinely tried to know you,

41:07.790 --> 41:11.160
but let's not forget this
is about you and Charles.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.120
- You two are both crazy, you know that.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.970
- Let's try to get out of here alive.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.240
- I have an idea.
- What?

41:20.240 --> 41:22.240
- I'll confront him.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.623
- That's a good idea.

41:24.527 --> 41:25.790
Eh?

41:25.790 --> 41:27.060
Come down, please.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.500
I will put away my pistol.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.640
- He will shoot you on sight.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.163
- I have my way with men.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.550
- I can see that.

41:35.550 --> 41:37.257
- What is that supposed to mean?

41:37.257 --> 41:39.830
- You could have been
enjoying life and money.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.503
Instead, you got caught up in a

41:41.503 --> 41:43.907
(speaks in foreign language).
- [Both] Shut up!

41:43.907 --> 41:46.657
(Drummer laughs)

41:50.580 --> 41:53.330
- Lightning doesn't strike
the same way twice, does it?

41:55.140 --> 41:56.303
I got it.

41:57.660 --> 42:00.500
Is this some sort of joke or game to you?

42:00.500 --> 42:05.430
- Look, we need to focus
and get outta here alive.

42:05.430 --> 42:07.430
You can shoot me afterwards if you like.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.130
- I'll keep that in mind.

42:10.130 --> 42:11.923
- Just shoot him already!

42:13.160 --> 42:16.950
Steven, the more you delay,

42:16.950 --> 42:19.443
the more it becomes worse for you.

42:20.610 --> 42:23.613
He tried to kill you
twice, for that matter.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.913
You don't think he won't do it again?

42:29.460 --> 42:31.950
Think about this. (speaks
in foreign language)

42:31.950 --> 42:35.293
Once a killer, always a killer.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.497
- Don't listen to him.

42:38.497 --> 42:40.585
He's trained for that kinda mission.

42:40.585 --> 42:43.100
- He had all the facts!

42:43.100 --> 42:46.200
- Look, I know this may sound crazy.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.810
My younger sister is in the hospital.

42:48.810 --> 42:50.332
She's sick with cancer.

42:50.332 --> 42:51.165
- Whatever.

42:51.165 --> 42:52.560
Is that one of your lies?

42:52.560 --> 42:55.600
- I needed the money
to pay for her surgery.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.750
- You can look at the sky. (laughing)

42:58.750 --> 43:01.010
She has caught you in your lies.

43:01.010 --> 43:04.362
Oh yeah, let the fireworks begin.

43:04.362 --> 43:06.362
Let the fireworks begin!

43:07.557 --> 43:09.215
Come down.

43:09.215 --> 43:12.138
Come down.

43:12.138 --> 43:15.767
Come down.

43:15.767 --> 43:16.600
Come down!

43:24.590 --> 43:28.330
- You kill people for money
to save your sister's life?

43:28.330 --> 43:32.440
That makes no sense,
whatever your name is.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.210
- My real name's Steven.

43:34.210 --> 43:35.710
- I don't care what your name is

43:35.710 --> 43:38.100
or anything about your sister, okay?

43:38.100 --> 43:40.350
I need to get out of
here one way or another.

43:41.340 --> 43:43.060
(gun firing)

43:43.060 --> 43:44.600
Give me the gun.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.730
- Promise you won't shoot me with it.

43:46.730 --> 43:49.440
- I will kill you with my bare hands

43:49.440 --> 43:52.380
if you don't give me that gun right now.

43:52.380 --> 43:54.680
- Can you be any nicer about it?

43:54.680 --> 43:57.053
- Give me the gun, please.

43:58.350 --> 43:59.440
- Let's plan this.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.390
- Who's the marine?

44:10.337 --> 44:13.973
- Jarheads are good at
taking orders, yeah?

44:15.820 --> 44:17.630
So why don't you be a good boy

44:19.028 --> 44:21.433
and put the bullet in
your brains, prostitute.

44:23.740 --> 44:27.263
I will tell him you killed
yourself like a real soldier.

44:29.661 --> 44:31.190
That way he wouldn't blame me

44:31.190 --> 44:33.093
for making your corpse look ugly.

44:34.270 --> 44:35.440
- He just called me a whore.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.850
He literally called me a whore!

44:37.850 --> 44:40.250
- He's messing with your head.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.267
We need to get out of here.

44:42.267 --> 44:47.267
- You're an uneducated
tramp, you know that, right?

44:47.899 --> 44:49.982
- He just wants to get, wait.

44:49.982 --> 44:52.110
He wants to get you all rattled up

44:52.110 --> 44:53.943
and take advantage, that's what he wants.

44:53.943 --> 44:58.943
- Well, then let's give him a medal then!

45:00.425 --> 45:01.258
- Mister?

45:02.531 --> 45:04.364
Let's make a deal now.

45:06.140 --> 45:08.000
Put the bullet in her brains

45:08.000 --> 45:10.747
and I'll share half of my money with you.

45:10.747 --> 45:12.380
- Leave this premise right now

45:12.380 --> 45:15.193
and I'll forget this ever happened.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.740
- You are going to regret this all!

45:18.740 --> 45:21.490
You are going to regret this all!

45:24.073 --> 45:26.403
- Give me that gun so
I can kill this idiot.

45:35.490 --> 45:37.223
We have one bullet left.

45:39.380 --> 45:40.213
Now what?

45:45.211 --> 45:48.211
(soft, tense music)

45:52.730 --> 45:53.563
- Listen.

45:54.500 --> 45:56.750
We're gonna give you up first.

45:56.750 --> 45:57.970
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

45:57.970 --> 45:58.803
Shh, shh, shh!

45:59.860 --> 46:01.320
This is the plan, okay?

46:01.320 --> 46:02.860
You're gonna take that scissors,

46:02.860 --> 46:04.110
tuck it behind your back.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.352
I'm gonna walk close with you.

46:07.352 --> 46:09.833
We're gonna go down the stairs slowly.

46:10.970 --> 46:14.150
Once we get close to
him, I'll distract him

46:14.150 --> 46:15.210
and you stab him.

46:15.210 --> 46:17.313
- That's way too dangerous.

46:18.700 --> 46:19.810
- We have to try.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.580
- You killed people for a living

46:21.580 --> 46:23.650
before your sister was sick, right?

46:23.650 --> 46:24.483
- So you do care.

46:24.483 --> 46:25.530
- Answer the question.

46:27.300 --> 46:29.173
- Yes, I killed bad people.

46:30.216 --> 46:31.660
- That is so messed up.

46:31.660 --> 46:34.200
I don't know who's more crazy, you or him.

46:34.200 --> 46:38.550
- If you love somebody,
you'll kill the whole world

46:38.550 --> 46:40.210
to save their life.

46:40.210 --> 46:42.623
- Perception, perception.

46:44.310 --> 46:45.823
So messed up.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.343
- When I was a boy,

46:51.400 --> 46:54.123
I always wanted to be Scaramanga.

46:56.580 --> 47:01.403
All the other kids wanted to
be James Bond, or the hero.

47:06.510 --> 47:08.197
I fit this job perfectly.

47:09.540 --> 47:12.323
You always go for what others can't do.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.390
- He dies at the end.

47:16.390 --> 47:19.068
- We all die in the end.

47:19.068 --> 47:21.517
I'm always the last man standing.

47:21.517 --> 47:22.562
- Yeah?

47:22.562 --> 47:25.310
Let me be the judge of that.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.502
I am not that easy to get rid of.

47:27.502 --> 47:28.970
- Yet you are in bed with your killer.

47:28.970 --> 47:32.180
- I swear to God I will
blow your brains out!

47:32.180 --> 47:33.870
- Don't be blamin' you.

47:33.870 --> 47:34.923
I been a job.

47:35.870 --> 47:39.760
Nonsense, that's all
you keep thinking about,

47:39.760 --> 47:42.443
blowing somebody in the heat of battle.

47:43.590 --> 47:44.423
God.

47:45.587 --> 47:47.837
You need salvation sharply.

47:50.380 --> 47:52.797
I shall work a month for you.

47:58.412 --> 48:00.912
About to get turnt up in here.

48:10.549 --> 48:13.807
(furnace humming)

48:13.807 --> 48:16.807
(soft, tense music)

48:59.245 --> 49:01.828
- Seriously, dude, let me fix this.

49:01.828 --> 49:03.523
♪ No more water ♪

49:03.523 --> 49:04.812
- [Clara] Oh, great.

49:04.812 --> 49:07.610
♪ No more water ♪

49:07.610 --> 49:10.263
♪ No more water ♪

49:10.263 --> 49:12.013
♪ No more water ♪

49:12.013 --> 49:13.831
- Where did they dig you from?

49:13.831 --> 49:16.665
♪ No more water ♪

49:16.665 --> 49:19.910
♪ No more water ♪

49:19.910 --> 49:22.919
♪ No more water ♪

49:22.919 --> 49:25.586
♪ No more water ♪

49:53.570 --> 49:54.950
- I'm thirsty.

49:54.950 --> 49:55.783
- Me too.

49:56.930 --> 49:58.810
- He turned up the heat.

49:58.810 --> 50:00.300
- Clever.

50:00.300 --> 50:01.133
- Moron.

50:03.030 --> 50:03.930
Shut off the vent.

50:05.040 --> 50:05.903
- Please.

50:06.787 --> 50:07.620
- Please.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.333
- It's broken.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.183
- Let me check.

50:23.810 --> 50:26.477
(Steven groans)

50:36.847 --> 50:38.930
I'm gonna get some water.

51:09.610 --> 51:11.110
He shut off the water as well.

51:12.020 --> 51:13.710
- Are you serious?
- Yes, he did.

51:13.710 --> 51:16.053
- What is wrong with you?

51:18.314 --> 51:19.147
(Drummer laughing)

51:19.147 --> 51:20.573
- I need some pain killers.

51:21.410 --> 51:23.890
- Okay, well, they're in
the pantry in the kitchen.

51:23.890 --> 51:24.853
- Of course it is.

51:28.971 --> 51:30.510
(Drummer groaning)

51:30.510 --> 51:32.462
Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

51:32.462 --> 51:35.462
(suspenseful music)

51:39.030 --> 51:40.970
- You're injured as well.

51:40.970 --> 51:42.823
You're gonna need medical attention.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.623
- Pain is good for the soul.

51:49.310 --> 51:51.613
It purifies the being.

51:51.613 --> 51:54.030
(gun firing)

52:08.130 --> 52:10.033
I'm getting bored down here.

52:13.624 --> 52:15.767
I'm getting bored down here.

52:29.310 --> 52:30.160
- What are you doing?

52:30.160 --> 52:32.650
- I'd rather die than be in here anymore!

52:32.650 --> 52:34.513
I can't stand this heat!

52:34.513 --> 52:36.394
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

52:36.394 --> 52:40.792
- I just wish I could
jump out of this window.

52:40.792 --> 52:43.552
- It's okay, it's gonna be all right.

52:43.552 --> 52:44.943
We'll figure this out, okay?

52:46.353 --> 52:51.353
We'll get through this, we'll
get through this, all right?

53:06.853 --> 53:10.020
- On a given day, Clara, you're a two,

53:12.264 --> 53:14.847
maybe a three at the very most.

53:16.547 --> 53:19.641
- You know you can't have me,
you illiterate piece of scum!

53:19.641 --> 53:21.380
(gun firing)

53:21.380 --> 53:23.733
You and your mother are dead!

53:24.580 --> 53:27.950
- Don't aggravate him, okay?

53:27.950 --> 53:29.850
- You're acting like a teammate, dude.

53:31.295 --> 53:33.070
- Dude?
- Yeah.

53:33.070 --> 53:36.800
You're just a killer
who got whipped by this.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.220
You know I'm a 10.

53:39.740 --> 53:41.850
- Are you taking that guy seriously?

53:41.850 --> 53:42.683
Really?

53:43.840 --> 53:47.040
- You know I give you an extra one, right?

53:47.040 --> 53:48.373
You're not that cute.

53:49.386 --> 53:53.303
(speaking in foreign language)

53:55.018 --> 53:59.685
(gun firing)
(laughing)

54:00.980 --> 54:02.680
- What were you thinking?

54:02.680 --> 54:04.240
That was our last bullet.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.270
- Yeah?

54:05.270 --> 54:08.013
Well, I guess your hail
Mary idea is our only hope.

54:09.350 --> 54:11.533
- The thing about black people,

54:12.590 --> 54:15.473
when they see white chicks their head goes

54:15.473 --> 54:19.230
(speaks in foreign language).

54:19.230 --> 54:23.330
I don't understand why blacks
can't stick with blacks

54:23.330 --> 54:25.793
and whites can't stick
with their own kind.

54:29.370 --> 54:32.973
My white clients always pay
me more for my services.

54:34.810 --> 54:36.413
Black people are very cheap.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.933
So when I kill them, I
piss on their corpse.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.993
I never piss on a white person's body.

54:49.450 --> 54:53.493
But for you, Clara, I
will make an exception.

54:55.350 --> 54:58.787
But for you, I will make an exception.

55:00.610 --> 55:01.660
- [Steven] You ready?

55:03.130 --> 55:05.079
- No, I need some time.

55:05.079 --> 55:08.079
(soft, tense music)

55:13.816 --> 55:16.566
- So it's about the money, right?

55:17.490 --> 55:20.323
Look, just leave.

55:21.700 --> 55:24.770
I will transfer the
money into your account,

55:24.770 --> 55:26.183
any account of your choice.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.793
- Serious fool.

55:32.090 --> 55:33.513
You think I be idiot.

55:35.200 --> 55:39.117
(speaking in foreign language)

55:40.658 --> 55:42.372
- What is he saying?

55:42.372 --> 55:44.000
- I have no idea what he's talking about.

55:44.000 --> 55:44.833
- What do you mean, you don't know?

55:44.833 --> 55:46.565
Aren't you African or something?

55:46.565 --> 55:47.398
- So?

55:51.190 --> 55:53.690
- Will half a million
things do somethin' for you?

55:56.380 --> 55:58.053
- I must live to my code.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.320
I have to kill that
woman or I won't sleep.

56:06.627 --> 56:08.220
I won't have peace.

56:08.220 --> 56:11.630
- [Stevne] Look, I'll transfer
the money into your account.

56:11.630 --> 56:14.150
No one has to know, I promise.

56:14.150 --> 56:15.420
You have my word.

56:16.517 --> 56:17.517
- Your word?

56:20.067 --> 56:22.220
Your word is not good enough here.

56:23.820 --> 56:25.290
You think I'm a fool?

56:27.130 --> 56:28.343
I trust nobody.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.193
There is no amount of
money that can buy peace.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.780
Don't you read your Bible?

56:37.970 --> 56:38.963
Infidels.

56:40.330 --> 56:42.019
- Do you hear yourself?

56:42.019 --> 56:42.923
- Woman, shut up!

56:44.240 --> 56:47.593
When men are talking, you should be quiet.

56:47.593 --> 56:48.426
Shhh.

56:52.320 --> 56:56.760
Proverbs chapter 28 verse 21 says

56:56.760 --> 57:01.760
partiality is not good,
yet a person will do wrong

57:02.060 --> 57:03.852
for a piece of bread.

57:03.852 --> 57:05.269
- Shut up!
- Woo!

57:07.210 --> 57:09.223
I love feisty.

57:17.770 --> 57:18.603
- I'm ready.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.318
Let's do this.

57:21.318 --> 57:22.513
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

57:26.810 --> 57:27.910
- Let's hope he bites.

57:29.010 --> 57:30.663
All right.

57:30.663 --> 57:33.580
(doorbell ringing)

57:35.257 --> 57:36.174
Who's that?

57:40.757 --> 57:43.340
(gun clicking)

57:49.287 --> 57:51.240
- [Nancy] Uh, is everything okay?

57:51.240 --> 57:52.363
- Why wouldn't it be?

57:54.980 --> 57:56.823
- I thought I heard gun shots.

57:57.770 --> 57:59.899
- And you are?
- Where's Clara?

57:59.899 --> 58:02.032
- And you are?
- I'm, I'm the neighbor.

58:02.032 --> 58:03.532
- Ooh, come on in.

58:08.225 --> 58:09.553
- He has us trapped!

58:09.553 --> 58:10.386
Run!

58:10.386 --> 58:11.824
(dramatic music)

58:11.824 --> 58:12.657
- No!

58:12.657 --> 58:13.490
Don't!

58:13.490 --> 58:14.323
Clara!!

58:14.323 --> 58:15.156
No!

58:15.156 --> 58:18.137
No!
(thwacking)

58:18.137 --> 58:21.137
(soft, tense music)

58:54.226 --> 58:56.893
(phone beeping)

59:02.272 --> 59:04.700
(phone ringing)

59:04.700 --> 59:05.823
- Yeah, it's me.

59:07.440 --> 59:11.010
Kill him.
- Got it, boss.

59:11.010 --> 59:11.843
I'm on it.

59:19.266 --> 59:22.016
(Clara sniffles)

59:27.965 --> 59:30.215
- What a safe neighborhood.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.110
No one is really calling the cops, huh?

59:39.498 --> 59:42.165
(Nancy moaning)

01:00:04.921 --> 01:00:07.588
(Nancy shrieks)

01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:11.825
- See what you make me do?

01:00:13.936 --> 01:00:16.297
Her blood is on your hands.

01:00:16.297 --> 01:00:18.547
- You bloodthirsty bastard!

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:24.542
(smacking)
(Nancy sobbing)

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:27.526
♪ She is still alive ♪

01:00:27.526 --> 01:00:32.156
♪ You can save her ♪

01:00:32.156 --> 01:00:35.570
♪ Just do the right thing ♪

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:40.570
♪ And turn yourselves to me ♪

01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:48.344

death as painless as possible ♪

01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:55.492
♪ Just do the right thing ♪

01:00:55.492 --> 01:00:58.992
♪ And turn yourself to me ♪

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.493
You read your Bible and
go to church, right?

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.057
You will go to heaven.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.923
It is a better place than here.

01:01:21.926 --> 01:01:24.593
(Nancy sobbing)

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.403
I forgot, Stev.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.783
You've been fornicating with this sinner.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.163
God hates people like you.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.850
You should ask for forgiveness sharply.

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:49.659
Save this woman's life
and God will forgive you

01:01:49.659 --> 01:01:50.492
when you die.

01:01:50.492 --> 01:01:52.320
- Where do you think
you're going in the end?

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.313
- Stop asking foolish question
before I (mumbles) for you.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:02.517
Get down here in six seconds
before this deal expires.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:04.666
One.

01:02:06.207 --> 01:02:07.509
Two.

01:02:07.509 --> 01:02:09.552
- No, he's bluffing, he's not gonna do it.

01:02:09.552 --> 01:02:10.953
- Three.

01:02:10.953 --> 01:02:13.545
(Nancy sobbing)

01:02:13.545 --> 01:02:14.378
Four.

01:02:15.805 --> 01:02:17.001
Five.

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:19.778
(gun firing)

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:22.201
(Clara whimpering)

01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:24.868
(ominous music)

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:42.070
See what you make me do?

01:02:44.446 --> 01:02:46.446
See what you made me do?

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.453
If you had listened to me,
she wouldn't have died.

01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:00.721
(soft, tense music)

01:03:08.906 --> 01:03:12.073
(fast-paced drumming)

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.380
I'm tired of playing games with you guys.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.290
I'm burning this thing to the ground.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.950
- Let's check the windows real quick.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:49.853
Nah.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.223
Nah, nah, no, no, no, no.

01:04:00.095 --> 01:04:00.928
Ooh, shit!

01:04:02.737 --> 01:04:03.570
Ooh.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:29.364
- These people no get petrol.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:37.271
(phone vibrating)

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.923
This has been here all this while.

01:04:51.004 --> 01:04:54.390
(speaks in foreign language)

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.858
- [Jessica] Hey girl, are
we still going jogging

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:56.941
this evening?

01:04:58.124 --> 01:04:59.010
Hello?

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.060
Are we going jogging?

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:05.163
- Hi, Jess.

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.093
Clara's in the restroom.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.450
She told me to tell you
she'll be waiting for you.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.900
- [Jessica] She told me about you.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.080
Okay, I'll see you guys soon.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.913
Thanks.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:16.990
- Bye-bye for now.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.840
See you soon.

01:05:22.874 --> 01:05:24.079
Have no fear.

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:27.079
(suspenseful music)

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:46.960
Since I'm a good person, I
decided not to burn the house.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.450
- Stop doing that.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.080
- Stop doing what?

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.890
- Biting your nails.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.790
- Dude downstairs just killed Ms. Nancy

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:00.900
and you're worried about
me biting my nails?

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.940
- You guys argue like a new couple.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.600
- Maybe you should get a woman sometime

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.110
and your perspective of life would change.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.800
- You got jokes.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.003
You should try being a standup comedian.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.380
Professional killers should know

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.463
attachments are bad for business.

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:21.723
- I'm talkin' to a fool.

01:06:22.726 --> 01:06:23.559
Ugh.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.020
- What do we have here?

01:06:59.691 --> 01:07:02.774
I see you're quite the artist, Clara.

01:07:04.533 --> 01:07:07.586
- You, please put them back!

01:07:07.586 --> 01:07:10.420
Your business is with you.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.253
I mean me.

01:07:11.253 --> 01:07:12.793
Please put the paintings back.

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:16.290
- Would you trade your
life for these paintings?

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.220
I'm giving you to the count of five

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.733
before I obliterate these things.

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:24.662
One.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:26.663
Two.

01:07:29.676 --> 01:07:32.160
You can take your pick if you want to.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.970
I won't shoot you, I promise.

01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.500
- You're a piece of crap!

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.913
What is it with you?

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.030
- I'm here to do my job.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:42.863
Four.

01:07:45.334 --> 01:07:46.167
Five!

01:07:48.603 --> 01:07:50.936
(thwacking)

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.980
- It's going to be okay.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.963
- Stop saying that!

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.383
It's not going to be okay.

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.123
He destroyed my life's work.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.310
It reminded me of my dad.

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:08.930
Whenever I wanted to think about my dad,

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:09.973
I'd look at that.

01:08:11.442 --> 01:08:13.170
And he destroyed it.

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.773
It's not going to be okay!

01:08:17.604 --> 01:08:20.063
- I'm not leaving this house without you.

01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:23.993
That's all he wants.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:25.710
He's crazy.

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:27.917
He's just trying to get into your head.

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:31.912
We're gonna get out of this alive, okay?

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:33.723
- Right.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.154
- We are gonna get out of this.

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:41.237
(somber piano music)

01:08:45.357 --> 01:08:48.024
(Clara sobbing)

01:08:50.036 --> 01:08:53.260
(Drummer laughing)

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.363
- That's so cute, so cute.

01:08:58.363 --> 01:09:01.550
(speaking in foreign language)

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.443
That painting is one to cry for.

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:05.653
You never see anything.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.053
Come down.

01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:12.763
Let me put you out of your misery.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.363
Huh?

01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:28.942
(doorbell ringing)

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:31.993
- Who's that?

01:09:36.277 --> 01:09:39.277
(suspenseful music)

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:56.760
- Hi. (laughs)

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.203
We've been expecting you.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:04.683
- That's Mary.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:06.990
That's my best friend.

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.231
I don't know what she's doing here.

01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:14.231
- Please don't hurt me!

01:10:16.239 --> 01:10:18.822
P-please, please don't hurt me.

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.536
(Mary whimpering)

01:10:32.536 --> 01:10:35.170
Please don't hurt me, okay?

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:38.363
- I took the liberty of
inviting her here myself.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:47.427
I told her you wanted to see her urgently.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:52.703
Her curiosity actually put
her in this predicament.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.483
How do you like my grammar, sweetheart?

01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:59.590
Oh no, she...

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:01.873
I get that she's calling me illiterate.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:04.013
Oh, me!

01:11:06.837 --> 01:11:08.710
(speaking in foreign language)

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:10.683
Definition, get out of here.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.883
Busy body, you not getting the joke?

01:11:17.998 --> 01:11:19.560
You just foolishly come.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.010
- I didn't do anything wrong!

01:11:22.858 --> 01:11:23.691
- What's your problem?

01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:25.513
You let her go now!

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:30.500
- She's a witness.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.863
No, can't do.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.393
- What's your problem?

01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:37.346
What's your problem?

01:11:37.346 --> 01:11:41.833
- [Mary] (sobbing) Can
you please let me go?

01:11:47.756 --> 01:11:49.950
Just let me go, please!

01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.096
Please.

01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:52.249
Please.

01:11:52.249 --> 01:11:53.082
Please.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:55.063
Clara!

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:58.290
- Let go of her, you sick psychopath!

01:12:06.307 --> 01:12:08.193
- I won't rush this one.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:14.100
I will be patient and give
you time to think about it.

01:12:16.839 --> 01:12:20.589
If not, her brains will
decorate this carpet.

01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:25.666
You are an artist.

01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:26.806
I am Picasso.

01:12:26.806 --> 01:12:29.473
(ominous music)

01:12:34.377 --> 01:12:37.210
(Mary whimpering)

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:52.229
(gun firing)
(Mary screaming)

01:13:08.589 --> 01:13:13.589
(gun firing)
(Mary screaming)

01:13:17.733 --> 01:13:19.548
I am warning you!

01:13:19.548 --> 01:13:21.465
You can still save her.

01:13:23.037 --> 01:13:25.693
Why would you be doing
this to your friend?

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.410
Is your life worth more than hers?

01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:33.156
- I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands!

01:13:33.156 --> 01:13:35.402
- Now we are talking.

01:13:35.402 --> 01:13:36.493
Now we are talking!

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:50.053
(gun firing)
(Mary sobbing)

01:13:50.053 --> 01:13:51.427
- Please let her go!

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.116
Please stop torturing her!

01:13:53.116 --> 01:13:54.616
Please let her go!

01:14:00.406 --> 01:14:03.949
(speaks in foreign language)

01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:06.843
- You're very selfish.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:09.520
Which kind of person you be?

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.353
Huh?

01:14:14.734 --> 01:14:16.318
Okay.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:19.151
(Mary whimpering)

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.540
Is that how you beg?

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.610
Let me see you beg again.

01:14:37.637 --> 01:14:39.554
I'm getting tired here.

01:14:41.027 --> 01:14:41.860
Hm?

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:51.219
(Clara sobbing)

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.200
I haven't seen this girl before.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.663
If you were a kindhearted person,

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:07.133
you'd have given your life
up like Jesus did for us.

01:15:09.285 --> 01:15:10.952
You are real mugger.

01:15:33.397 --> 01:15:36.314
(Drummer laughing)

01:15:48.453 --> 01:15:50.829
(Mary wailing)

01:15:50.829 --> 01:15:53.710
(gun firing)

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.926
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.578
(Clara screaming)

01:15:58.578 --> 01:16:00.810
(sobbing)

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.977
(somber string music)

01:16:12.826 --> 01:16:14.493
- Look at me, Clara.

01:16:17.551 --> 01:16:18.468
Look at me.

01:16:20.385 --> 01:16:23.081
We are gonna get through this, okay?

01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:27.401
You're a marine and
you've seen worse, okay?

01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:31.573
- That is my best friend he just killed.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.813
- You said I should let her go.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.973
I followed your instructions.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.923
All you had to do was
walk down the stairs.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.950
You wouldn't be going
through such heartache.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.227
Death is a better choice.

01:17:23.635 --> 01:17:26.802
(fast-paced drumming)

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:37.431
- It's gonna be okay.

01:17:54.998 --> 01:17:57.248
(knocking)

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:10.647
(Drummer laughing)

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:17.060
- Hey, is Clara ready?

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.257
- Hi, we've been expecting you.

01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.507
(laughing)

01:18:26.651 --> 01:18:27.484
Go there.

01:18:29.185 --> 01:18:30.268
- Let her go!

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:36.453
- Who's there?
- That's my sister.

01:18:36.453 --> 01:18:37.730
- [Steven] What is she doing here?

01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:40.292
- We were supposed to go jogging, okay?

01:18:40.292 --> 01:18:43.489
- Please.

01:18:43.489 --> 01:18:45.202
Please don't do this, please!

01:18:45.202 --> 01:18:48.125
I don't know what you want.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.625
- I told you to say something.

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:54.570
- Please don't kill me.

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:55.403
- Okay.

01:19:03.010 --> 01:19:05.097
Look what we have here.

01:19:06.858 --> 01:19:08.800
Isn't this a surprise?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.820
Hm?

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.820
Just, just look at what
God has brought to me.

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:17.930
All my wishes are coming true.

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:25.860
Yes, this is why you keep your
phone on you at all times.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.866
Mother-snitches!

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:30.759
- Let her go!

01:19:30.759 --> 01:19:32.840
She hasn't done anything.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.683
- All you have to do is come downstairs.

01:19:37.747 --> 01:19:40.223
I will let her go, I promise.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:45.133
- Clara, don't do it!
- Shut up.

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:48.673
- [Clara] I'm ready.

01:19:49.777 --> 01:19:50.810
- Give me a second, okay?

01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:52.500
Just give me a second.

01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:59.030
- [Drummer] I'm waiting!

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.283
- Here's the plan.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.660
I'm gonna bring her downstairs

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.193
in exchange for her sister.

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:12.053
You can keep half the money.

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:19.420
- Sounds like a good plan.
(speaks in foreign language)

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.990
I won't shoot, I promise.

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:27.280
- I need to get really close to him.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.113
- That's the plan.

01:20:28.113 --> 01:20:29.853
- What if he shoots us on sight?

01:20:30.758 --> 01:20:31.591
- Mmm, nah.

01:20:31.591 --> 01:20:33.310
Not after giving him this much hell.

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:34.360
He wouldn't.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.160
- Let's hope you're right this time.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.690
Let's do this.
- All right.

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:40.120
- I'm waiting!

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.573
Stop wasting my time.

01:21:01.613 --> 01:21:06.446
(thwacking)
(Clara gasps)

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:10.497
(Jessica thudding)

01:21:10.497 --> 01:21:13.164
(ominous music)

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:23.633
Tougher than you look,
I will give this to you.

01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:27.823
But every good thing
eventually comes to an end.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.493
Any last requests?

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.700
Stop right there.

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.780
- You promise to let her go.

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.080
- I promise to let her go.

01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:40.330
I promise to let her go.

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.163
See?

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:41.996
I'm out.

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:44.323
Are you hiding a pistol?

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.960
- No, I'm not hiding a pistol.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.710
- Raise your shirt and turn around.

01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:59.833
Ahh.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.543
You ran out of bullets.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.063
I almost felt insulted.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.059
(Clara screams)

01:22:27.059 --> 01:22:28.817
(grunting)

01:22:28.817 --> 01:22:31.528
(dramatic music)

01:22:31.528 --> 01:22:33.861
(thwacking)

01:22:35.182 --> 01:22:40.182
(Clara thudding)
(Drummer groans)

01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:46.093
I think I am tired of shooting.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.490
Kitchen knives will
suffice, mother-snitches.

01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:55.970
- Look, I have three million dollars

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.630
in my safety deposit box.

01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:59.760
- How will a man who has
three million dollars

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.430
start somewhere else?

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:03.463
Not pay for his sister's medical bills.

01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:09.260
I told you, I only want Clara.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.910
You carry yourself joint trouble.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.330
Go.

01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:16.053
Unless you're a cold bastard

01:23:16.053 --> 01:23:18.423
who doesn't care about his family,

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:21.653
which I highly doubt it.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.530
You love your sister.

01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:28.658
Maybe I can pay her a visit
when I'm through with you guys.

01:23:28.658 --> 01:23:29.673
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:23:29.673 --> 01:23:31.749
You stay away from my family!

01:23:31.749 --> 01:23:34.064
(Drummer laughing)

01:23:34.064 --> 01:23:37.064
(soft, tense music)

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
- I'm a blessed man.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.233
I came for one and I got five.

01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:53.819
So, which one of you will go first?

01:23:53.819 --> 01:23:55.910
(Steven groans)

01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:57.250
- Just, dude...

01:23:58.090 --> 01:23:58.923
- Hm?

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.293
Where did you say the money was?

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.220
Where is the key?

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.793
What is the address?

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.160
What--

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.313
- Look, I'd have to take you there myself.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.730
I don't have the keys with me.

01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:21.730
- You will tell me where the money is

01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:23.060
or I will kill her.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.473
- I mean, just let her go.

01:24:24.473 --> 01:24:26.130
I mean, come on, what else you want?

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.360
- [Drummer] Okay.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.596
You will tell me where
it is or I will kill her.

01:24:31.596 --> 01:24:36.179
(thwacking)
(grunting)

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:43.534
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:24:45.605 --> 01:24:49.605
(somber string and piano music)

01:24:56.171 --> 01:24:57.421
- Are you okay?

01:25:09.006 --> 01:25:10.431
(Jessica sobbing)

01:25:10.431 --> 01:25:11.886
- Come on, guys.

01:25:11.886 --> 01:25:12.750
You guys okay?

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.197
Go upstairs right now.

01:25:31.356 --> 01:25:33.773
(gun firing)

01:26:02.034 --> 01:26:04.716
(gun firing)

01:26:04.716 --> 01:26:06.326
(thwacking)
(grunting)

01:26:06.326 --> 01:26:08.944
(Steven screaming)

01:26:08.944 --> 01:26:11.694
(dramatic music)

01:26:16.161 --> 01:26:19.078
(glass shattering)

01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:22.548
- Come on.

01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:40.062
(phone vibrating)

01:27:03.812 --> 01:27:05.813
- Nah, I just told you
to be patient, right?

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.593
Yeah, done deal.

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.613
Right.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.004
Well, I mean, it just depends.

01:27:12.004 --> 01:27:14.723
It's gonna take a couple minutes, but...

01:27:14.723 --> 01:27:17.163
- Oh, babe, I'm gonna go grab dinner.

01:27:19.885 --> 01:27:21.024
- Yeah.

01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:22.880
I don't know, 15?

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.637
Right, I'll see you in a few.

01:27:25.549 --> 01:27:28.024
(insects chirping)

01:27:28.024 --> 01:27:31.537
(suspenseful music)

01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:34.204
(neck snapping)

01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:38.307
Yeah.

01:27:38.307 --> 01:27:41.300
No, no, no, we're on
our way right now, man.

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.960
Yeah.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.443
Nah, like 15 minutes tops.

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:46.820
Right.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.380
Nah, man.

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.680
Yeah, it's gonna be all right.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.570
We gonna make it rain
tonight in magic city, baby,

01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:54.250
you know that.

01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:55.287
Yeah, right.

01:27:58.601 --> 01:27:59.434
Right.

01:28:01.065 --> 01:28:02.398
Yeah, it's nice.

01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:06.528
(gun firing)

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.687
Hope you know what you're doin', Steven.

01:28:10.687 --> 01:28:12.730
(gun firing)

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:15.897
(somber string music)

01:28:25.219 --> 01:28:28.052
(engine igniting)

01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:43.883
- Close the door.

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.213
- Okay.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.873
Closing.

01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.313
I will give you whatev...

01:28:55.313 --> 01:28:57.730
(gun firing)

01:29:01.115 --> 01:29:03.640
(thudding)

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.390
(dramatic music)

01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:16.709
(laughing)

01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:32.048
(tense, energetic music)

01:30:26.677 --> 01:30:29.844
(somber string music)
