00:05.397 --> 00:08.698
I hope you're all enjoying
the view here at Withrow Midtown.

00:08.700 --> 00:13.136
Andrew Withrow, my big boss,
has built over 30 buildings,

00:13.138 --> 00:14.637
all cutting edge design.

00:14.639 --> 00:17.240
But he also loves
the history of our city,

00:17.242 --> 00:19.609
and tries to incorporate
elements from that

00:19.611 --> 00:22.812
as well as his own humble beginnings.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.818
Like these skybridges,

00:25.820 --> 00:28.221
which have been around
since the 19th century.

00:28.223 --> 00:31.290
Andrew Withrow actually put a skybridge

00:31.292 --> 00:33.726
in the sky, 59 stories up.

00:33.728 --> 00:36.662
You'll notice that the skybridge
is being suspended by...

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:58.686 --> 01:00.953
Billionaire developer Andrew Withrow

01:00.955 --> 01:04.090
formally charged 15 counts
of manslaughter.

01:04.092 --> 01:06.826
The structure collapse last October...

01:06.828 --> 01:08.361
Eight seconds on the clock,

01:08.363 --> 01:10.963
fourth down and it's all tied up.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.565
It call comes down to this.

01:12.567 --> 01:14.719
Just flick it already.

01:17.972 --> 01:19.872
And he scores.

01:19.874 --> 01:21.543
With authority.

01:21.568 --> 01:23.576
This game is an insult to football.

01:23.578 --> 01:25.111
Maybe the way you play it.

01:25.769 --> 01:27.273
An assistant U.S. attorney

01:27.275 --> 01:28.714
wants to talk with us.

01:28.716 --> 01:30.249
Says he's in danger of losing a case.

01:30.251 --> 01:31.617
Thank God.

01:31.619 --> 01:34.220
Careful, he's bored.

01:34.222 --> 01:35.555
You know that was fun.

01:35.557 --> 01:38.391
What if I said that you could
help put the most powerful.

01:38.393 --> 01:41.027
New York real estate developer in jail?

01:41.029 --> 01:42.829
Andrew Withrow.

01:42.831 --> 01:44.997
Andrew Withrow owns this building.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.265
Is that how you know him?

01:46.267 --> 01:47.934
Never met him.

01:47.936 --> 01:49.302
But...

01:49.304 --> 01:51.404
We were at a charity
auction a few years ago

01:51.406 --> 01:52.738
both bidding on the same item,

01:52.740 --> 01:55.108
the flight log from Charles Lindbergh's

01:55.110 --> 01:56.742
first trans-Atlantic crossing.

01:56.744 --> 01:59.212
- Withrow outbid you.
- Seven times.

01:59.214 --> 02:01.481
At a certain point I just
wanted to see how high he'd go.

02:01.483 --> 02:02.648
And he won.

02:02.650 --> 02:03.983
But the next day,

02:03.985 --> 02:07.109
he sent me the flight log with
a very nice handwritten note

02:07.111 --> 02:09.258
saying he didn't want it after all.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.723
And that's bad.

02:10.725 --> 02:11.757
It's just telling.

02:11.759 --> 02:13.993
Needing to beat someone that much.

02:14.772 --> 02:17.396
Wanting to wield power over someone.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.765
People call it micro-managing.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.467
I call it managing.

02:21.469 --> 02:23.035
I mean, if-if I'm gonna
put my name on it,

02:23.037 --> 02:25.872
I need to know it was done right.

02:25.874 --> 02:28.908
I'm a builder and the brick stops here.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.578
And I came up with the bad pun myself.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.415
- He's charming.
- Very.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.149
- I know.
- Is that why you think

02:36.151 --> 02:37.850
you're in danger of losing your case

02:37.852 --> 02:39.218
against him?

02:39.220 --> 02:40.618
My boss thinks that.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.755
Withrow has billions,

02:42.757 --> 02:44.724
and he's gonna spend every
last dollar to make sure

02:44.726 --> 02:47.193
that he beats a manslaughter conviction.

02:47.195 --> 02:48.928
Manslaughter,
so you'll need to prove.

02:48.930 --> 02:52.465
Withrow was criminally negligent
in building that skybridge.

02:52.467 --> 02:53.599
I've got it.

02:53.601 --> 02:55.635
I have design documents.

02:55.637 --> 02:58.938
There was an engineering flaw
and he signed off on it.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.674
The billionaire scrimped
on his flagship building

03:01.676 --> 03:03.142
to save a few bucks?

03:03.144 --> 03:04.277
It wasn't just money.

03:04.279 --> 03:05.845
It was time.

03:05.847 --> 03:07.813
A tenant who leased 19 floors
threatened to walk.

03:07.815 --> 03:09.148
To delay would have cost
tens of millions,

03:09.150 --> 03:12.084
and the magnesium composite
wasn't ready in time.

03:12.086 --> 03:15.388
15 people died
because he was in a hurry.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.457
I'm going to nail him
with his own signature.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.159
Maybe, with the right jury.

03:20.161 --> 03:23.329
Let's talk through
your voir dire process.

03:23.331 --> 03:25.264
Voir dire? That was yesterday.

03:25.266 --> 03:26.432
- What?
- It's okay.

03:26.434 --> 03:27.554
We already empaneled a jury.

03:29.704 --> 03:32.872
Well, let's talk about your suit.

03:32.874 --> 03:34.073
Chunk.

03:34.075 --> 03:37.276
The jury selection
is 90% of the ballgame.

03:37.278 --> 03:39.145
Deselection, actually.

03:39.147 --> 03:41.647
Technically you can't select a juror,

03:41.649 --> 03:44.116
only deselect the ones you don't like.

03:44.118 --> 03:45.851
Hey. Benny Colรณn. In-house counsel.

03:45.853 --> 03:47.019
Benny Colรณn, sure.

03:47.021 --> 03:49.455
- Have we met?
- No.

03:49.457 --> 03:50.788
No, not in person.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.825
Assistant U.S. Attorney Olsen.

03:52.827 --> 03:54.460
All right.

03:54.462 --> 03:56.062
Let's look at the bad news, shall we?

03:56.064 --> 03:58.097
Seven jurors are firmly against us.

03:58.099 --> 03:59.365
Seven.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.334
Well, they haven't heard
my opening argument.

04:01.336 --> 04:03.869
That's why jury selection
is so important.

04:03.871 --> 04:05.805
Our jurors have a lot different
perspectives on this case.

04:05.807 --> 04:09.875
Take Jeremy, he has severe dyslexia.

04:09.877 --> 04:11.665
Avoids reading whenever he can,

04:11.667 --> 04:14.413
which means that he won't assume
that just because.

04:14.415 --> 04:17.024
Withrow signed a document,
he'd actually read it.

04:17.111 --> 04:19.478
And this is Bryan.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.647
He is so pro-Withrow
that Withrow could drown

04:21.649 --> 04:24.883
a litter of puppies and he would
still find reasonable doubt.

04:24.885 --> 04:27.686
I picked him because he
supported Occupy Wall Street.

04:27.688 --> 04:28.887
He hates suits.

04:28.889 --> 04:31.590
Mid-level managers, bureaucrats like...

04:31.592 --> 04:32.724
You.

04:32.726 --> 04:34.460
But he admires billionaires.

04:34.462 --> 04:35.794
We have to find a narrative that appeals

04:35.796 --> 04:37.463
to both Jeremy and Bryan.

04:37.465 --> 04:40.499
They both like that Withrow
is a self-made man.

04:40.501 --> 04:42.167
When he came to New York he had nothing.

04:42.169 --> 04:44.169
They see his humble roots as evidence

04:44.171 --> 04:45.838
of hard work and authenticity.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.039
The accent

04:47.041 --> 04:50.109
gives him credibility
and about 20% more charm.

04:50.111 --> 04:52.010
Another things they like
about him, ironically,

04:52.012 --> 04:54.480
he is seen as someone
who takes responsibility.

04:54.482 --> 04:55.920
Wait a second.

04:56.550 --> 04:57.969
That interview.

04:58.219 --> 05:00.085
The brick stops here.

05:00.615 --> 05:03.122
That's our narrative,
taking responsibility.

05:03.124 --> 05:05.357
Because Withrow's brand is
being involved at every step,

05:05.359 --> 05:08.660
so we argue he must have read
the design documents.

05:08.662 --> 05:10.929
Okay, Marissa, keep digging.

05:10.931 --> 05:13.966
Let's exhume every one of those jurors.

05:14.494 --> 05:16.468
Time to meet the man of the hour.

05:18.139 --> 05:19.938
You're testing the bounds

05:19.940 --> 05:22.427
of my five minute rule, counsel.

05:22.986 --> 05:24.276
Where's your client?

05:25.146 --> 05:27.012
Her heart?

05:27.014 --> 05:28.380
Call me when you hear.

05:31.385 --> 05:32.784
Judge Levy, I'm sorry.

05:32.786 --> 05:36.488
My mother was just taken
to Sacred Heart Hospital.

05:36.490 --> 05:39.024
Your Honor, we respectfully
ask to deal opening statements.

05:39.026 --> 05:41.348
Just a day or so.

05:43.230 --> 05:44.997
She's 82, Your Honor.

05:45.372 --> 05:47.566
We're adjourned for 48 hours.

05:47.568 --> 05:48.568
Thank you.

05:51.872 --> 05:53.561
Mr. Withrow.

05:54.842 --> 05:56.675
I have to tell you I'm working

05:56.677 --> 05:58.437
with the U.S. Attorney's
office on this case.

05:59.178 --> 06:01.413
Nice to meet you, Mr...

06:03.520 --> 06:05.117
Dr. Jason Bull.

06:05.119 --> 06:06.251
How's your mother?

06:06.253 --> 06:07.986
I hope she's all right.

06:07.988 --> 06:09.221
It's hard.

06:09.223 --> 06:12.157
Especially after this whole
tragedy with the skybridge.

06:15.196 --> 06:16.628
Thank you.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.329
What was that?

06:22.870 --> 06:25.537
Andrew Withrow's sorrow
about the skybridge deaths

06:25.539 --> 06:26.939
was a fraction slow.

06:26.941 --> 06:29.441
The emotion showed on
his face a second late.

06:30.373 --> 06:31.643
So?

06:31.645 --> 06:32.844
Explains a lot.

06:32.846 --> 06:34.713
Have Danny look into Sacred Heart.

06:34.715 --> 06:36.631
That's where Withrow's mother is.

06:41.383 --> 06:43.383
_

06:45.626 --> 06:48.560
Okay, yeah.

06:48.562 --> 06:50.662
Thanks, Danny.

06:50.664 --> 06:53.799
So two days ago
Withrow's mother was admitted

06:53.801 --> 06:56.368
to Sacred Heart Hospital in the morning,

06:56.370 --> 06:59.571
and released two hours later.

06:59.573 --> 07:02.140
He stalled because the U.S.
Attorney's office brought me in,

07:02.142 --> 07:04.243
but what's his move?

07:05.546 --> 07:07.212
Hey, there, Dr. Bull.

07:07.214 --> 07:08.680
You miss me?

07:10.284 --> 07:12.542
Why, Diana Lindsay.

07:13.254 --> 07:15.420
What happened to your lovely
Southern accent?

07:16.378 --> 07:17.733
Left it in Texas.

07:17.758 --> 07:19.825
I didn't know you did criminal law.

07:19.827 --> 07:21.560
Come on, Jason.
You should know by now,

07:21.562 --> 07:23.795
I am full of surprises.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.398
I hate surprises.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.134
All rise.

07:30.738 --> 07:32.104
Good morning, Your Honor.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.438
I'm pleased to introduce

07:33.440 --> 07:35.007
my excellent new representation,

07:35.009 --> 07:37.409
the woman who will prove my innocence,

07:37.411 --> 07:38.944
Diana Lindsay, Esquire.

07:39.304 --> 07:42.414
No need for the formal
presentation, Mr. Withrow.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.849
This isn't a beauty pageant.

07:43.851 --> 07:46.118
I assure you, Judge Levy,
I have never been

07:46.120 --> 07:48.186
in a beauty pageant, and a courtroom

07:48.188 --> 07:49.554
is no place for pageantry.

07:49.906 --> 07:51.857
Good to hear.

07:51.859 --> 07:53.125
Now let's get to work.

07:53.127 --> 07:55.894
Opening statements, Mr. Olsen.

07:59.867 --> 08:01.933
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

08:01.935 --> 08:05.470
I'm Assistant U.S. Attorney
Dennis Olsen.

08:05.472 --> 08:07.139
I'm here to talk about

08:07.141 --> 08:08.907
- the tragic deaths...
- I like your shoes.

08:10.979 --> 08:13.078
That's a tough jury in there.

08:14.682 --> 08:16.581
Good opening statement.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.849
Thank you.

08:17.851 --> 08:20.786
And your guy, Olsen, he's a bit stiff.

08:20.788 --> 08:22.888
It was smart of the U.S.
Attorney to bring you on.

08:22.890 --> 08:25.791
Almost as smart as Withrow
bringing you on.

08:25.793 --> 08:27.459
He did his homework on you.

08:27.461 --> 08:29.061
You, too.

08:29.063 --> 08:30.996
- Don't flatter yourself.
- Yeah.

08:30.998 --> 08:32.664
You're right.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.717
You don't like me at all.

08:35.568 --> 08:38.770
Well, I'm still gonna
have to beat you... again.

08:38.772 --> 08:40.272
Okay.

08:42.176 --> 08:46.478
New York City isn't Callisto, Texas.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.913
You're on my turf this time.

08:47.915 --> 08:51.883
Funny. I thought it was Withrow's turf.

08:51.885 --> 08:54.419
He owns your building,
too, I understand.

08:54.421 --> 08:57.303
I do love your overconfidence.

08:57.305 --> 08:59.558
You know you're representing
a sociopath?

08:59.560 --> 09:00.792
Hey, how's your mother?

09:00.794 --> 09:03.295
Dr. Bull, right?

09:03.297 --> 09:05.850
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's much better, thanks.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.532
I'm glad to hear that.

09:07.534 --> 09:08.667
Diana.

09:08.669 --> 09:10.736
It's always a pleasure.

09:10.738 --> 09:12.104
You two know each other.

09:14.308 --> 09:16.241
I'll let you take that.

09:18.712 --> 09:19.945
Yeah.

09:19.947 --> 09:21.046
Bull, we were in the middle

09:21.048 --> 09:22.481
of uploading the data
of our mirror jury,

09:22.483 --> 09:24.983
when the power went out.

09:24.985 --> 09:26.451
We are stone cold dark here.

09:26.453 --> 09:27.753
First day of trial.

09:27.755 --> 09:29.154
What a coincidence.

09:29.156 --> 09:31.765
And Withrow owns our building.

09:32.659 --> 09:33.759
Come on, let's go.

09:33.761 --> 09:37.162
So, the first
move goes to Withrow.

09:37.164 --> 09:39.698
Now it's my turn.

09:47.445 --> 09:49.917
Still no luck getting the power on.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.249
You really think Andrew Withrow,

09:53.251 --> 09:56.301
the richest developer
in this city is a sociopath?

09:56.326 --> 09:57.725
Yeah.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.261
Most people think of heartless
killers when they hear the term,

10:00.263 --> 10:02.597
but 95% of sociopaths

10:02.599 --> 10:05.445
are highly successful
in all kinds of careers.

10:05.447 --> 10:08.135
Lack of empathy allows them to excel.

10:08.162 --> 10:09.795
But he seemed affected
when he was talking

10:09.797 --> 10:10.962
about the building collapse.

10:10.964 --> 10:13.632
Withrow learned to mimic emotion.

10:13.634 --> 10:16.635
When I asked him about the
deaths in his building,

10:16.637 --> 10:18.103
his micro expressions...

10:18.105 --> 10:20.025
the slight wincing of his eye muscles,

10:20.027 --> 10:21.840
the convex furrow of his left brow,

10:21.842 --> 10:24.576
and the f-f-forced micro stutter,

10:24.578 --> 10:26.812
they all came a hair late,

10:26.814 --> 10:28.980
and not in perfect unison.

10:28.982 --> 10:31.805
It was mimicry, not sympathy.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.286
It was a good tactic,

10:34.288 --> 10:36.133
bringing in Diana.

10:38.992 --> 10:40.125
What?

10:40.127 --> 10:41.459
Nobody said anything

10:41.461 --> 10:43.592
about Diana's bewitching effect on you.

10:43.594 --> 10:45.230
I certainly didn't.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.736
Cable, what's going on
with my generator?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.738
Hey, we're working on it. Foley?

10:53.740 --> 10:57.342
I pulled a favor,
because people like me,

10:57.344 --> 11:00.278
and a backup generator will be
here tomorrow afternoon-ish.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.647
We need the power on today, Foley.

11:04.518 --> 11:06.685
And I need to lose ten pounds,

11:06.687 --> 11:08.787
Dr. Bull, but not today.

11:12.292 --> 11:13.725
It's a good thing people like you.

11:14.497 --> 11:16.376
All right, we'll work at my place.

11:16.378 --> 11:17.311
Your apartment?

11:17.313 --> 11:18.313
Yes.

11:26.455 --> 11:28.622
Pretty sparsely furnished.

11:34.017 --> 11:35.896
What's below minimalist?

11:35.898 --> 11:38.165
Anyone want bagels?

11:40.136 --> 11:42.010
You can set up in the living room.

11:42.505 --> 11:44.571
Withrow can't stop TAC.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.739
Chunk, check it out.

11:45.741 --> 11:47.341
I got a new plant.

11:47.343 --> 11:48.609
Behind you.

11:49.266 --> 11:53.413
Yeah, really ties the place together.

11:53.415 --> 11:56.116
Thanks, man.

11:56.118 --> 11:58.419
How are you gonna deal with Withrow?

11:59.632 --> 12:02.089
Diana's never gonna
put him on the stand.

12:02.091 --> 12:03.957
That would be a bad move.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.559
What even is her strategy?

12:05.561 --> 12:09.129
Find a large bus, throw a
Withrow employee underneath it,

12:09.131 --> 12:10.998
and then your problem is solved.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.233
Blame an underling. Got it.

12:13.235 --> 12:17.638
Um, the project manager is
the most likely road kill.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.940
- Sean Laheri.
- All right. Let's see

12:19.942 --> 12:22.142
if someone with a personality
can get through to him.

12:22.873 --> 12:24.530
I'm texting Danny now.

12:24.532 --> 12:26.346
And, Chunk, our attorney,

12:26.348 --> 12:27.781
Olsen, reads pretty bland.

12:27.783 --> 12:29.383
See if you can sharpen him up.

12:29.385 --> 12:31.894
I'll put the sexy in skybridge.

12:32.221 --> 12:34.188
And where are you going?

12:34.190 --> 12:36.456
Turn the power back on.

12:36.458 --> 12:37.624
So where does that leave us?

12:37.626 --> 12:39.426
How long till we've got
to get back in there?

12:39.428 --> 12:40.828
Five, ten minutes?

12:40.830 --> 12:42.596
Andrew, you know,
it's the oddest thing.

12:42.598 --> 12:44.765
I am a tenant in one of your buildings.

12:45.151 --> 12:47.534
Really? I hope you're enjoying it.

12:47.536 --> 12:48.702
Well, I was,

12:48.704 --> 12:51.653
until the power went out,
and that was strange.

12:51.655 --> 12:53.761
You haven't heard anything
about it, have you?

12:53.763 --> 12:56.643
Sorry. I own over 60
buildings in New York.

12:56.645 --> 12:59.213
My people don't always
share the details.

12:59.215 --> 13:02.785
I thought you were
more of a hands-on guy.

13:03.059 --> 13:04.425
Must be a common misperception.

13:04.427 --> 13:05.927
No, no, I'll get to the bottom of this.

13:05.929 --> 13:08.129
Thank you for bringing it
to my attention.

13:08.774 --> 13:10.298
- Sure.
- Yeah.

13:13.503 --> 13:16.190
So, what's his tell? Well, you got him

13:16.192 --> 13:17.638
to lie to you so you
could read his tell.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.440
I just want my power back on.

13:19.442 --> 13:21.042
Withrow doesn't have a tell, does he?

13:21.044 --> 13:22.643
What do you think that means?

13:22.645 --> 13:24.378
He's telling the truth?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.581
Or he's a sociopath.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.217
You would say or do
anything to win this trial.

13:30.541 --> 13:31.819
So would you.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.023
Let the games begin.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.820
Is it me, or does the
gallery look a little empty?

13:50.822 --> 13:54.757
Almost as if it's missing...

13:54.759 --> 13:57.460
the 12 mirror jurors.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.502
How much did it cost to buy them off?

13:59.504 --> 14:00.964
Well, I wouldn't know.

14:00.966 --> 14:04.033
But the price of
12-person luxury bus

14:04.035 --> 14:08.122
to Atlantic City...
now that I might know.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.707
As a civil engineer with 20 plus

14:10.709 --> 14:12.876
years of experience,
can you please explain

14:12.878 --> 14:14.509
to the court what went wrong

14:14.511 --> 14:16.355
with the skybridge at Withrow Midtown?

14:16.357 --> 14:19.249
When this first support failed,

14:19.251 --> 14:21.251
the load that it was bearing

14:21.253 --> 14:23.258
was passed on
to the neighboring supports,

14:23.260 --> 14:25.455
and it's called the "Zipper Effect."

14:25.457 --> 14:26.990
And like a zipper unzipping,

14:26.992 --> 14:29.492
as each one overloaded,

14:29.494 --> 14:31.251
it cascaded down.

14:31.253 --> 14:32.996
And why did
that first support fail?

14:32.998 --> 14:34.297
Cheaper construction

14:34.299 --> 14:38.868
materials allowed the support
to wear away with time.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.304
Who authorized the use
of cheaper materials?

14:41.306 --> 14:42.972
Mr. Withrow.

14:42.974 --> 14:46.910
He personally signed off
on all designs and materials.

14:46.912 --> 14:48.144
Nothing further.

14:51.082 --> 14:53.283
You don't get
to be as powerful as Withrow

14:53.285 --> 14:54.484
without breaking the rules.

14:54.902 --> 14:57.478
Prosecution says that Mr. Withrow

14:57.480 --> 14:59.271
knowingly and willfully

14:59.273 --> 15:00.823
allowed a design flaw

15:00.825 --> 15:03.026
just because his signature
was on a document.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.520
Your Honor, I would like
to submit into evidence

15:05.545 --> 15:10.266
one month of signatures
in Andrew Withrow's world.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.953
Is it possible

15:29.955 --> 15:33.523
that the size of Mr. Withrow's
company would create the need

15:33.525 --> 15:35.491
for him to rely on his employees?

15:35.493 --> 15:37.260
He couldn't possibly keep track

15:37.262 --> 15:39.395
of all of these documents himself, so,

15:39.397 --> 15:40.563
he delegated.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.233
Perhaps to his project manager,
Sean Laheri.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.801
I really don't know...

15:44.803 --> 15:47.203
That's outside the scope
of my expertise.

15:48.543 --> 15:51.207
I see why Withrow brought
the defense attorney in.

15:51.209 --> 15:52.475
She's hot.

15:53.776 --> 15:54.978
We move to strike.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.179
Juror Number Seven.

15:56.181 --> 15:57.708
We found a Reddit thread
where he bragged

15:57.732 --> 15:59.916
about smoking marijuana
every day before court.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.551
Your Honor, this is clearly

16:01.553 --> 16:04.387
a move by their jury
consultant to change the jury.

16:04.389 --> 16:06.798
Let's hear from Juror Number Seven.

16:06.823 --> 16:08.990
Bryan?

16:10.322 --> 16:12.562
Smoking? Me?

16:12.564 --> 16:14.430
Here?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.866
Reddit. That's, um...

16:16.868 --> 16:19.016
That's the...

16:20.493 --> 16:22.092
What was the question?

16:22.340 --> 16:24.841
Motion to strike granted.

16:27.145 --> 16:29.679
It's time we got it back on.

16:29.681 --> 16:31.848
The power in TAC.

16:40.388 --> 16:41.691
Beg your pardon, Your Honor,

16:41.693 --> 16:43.960
but before we continue,
we must move to strike.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.194
Juror Number Three.

16:45.196 --> 16:46.596
She was overheard

16:46.598 --> 16:48.131
calling Mr. Withrow names.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.666
Marissa?

16:49.668 --> 16:53.437
Indra Pratt, 22,
elementary school teacher.

16:53.439 --> 16:55.383
She's one of ours, Bull.

16:55.385 --> 16:59.175
But her replacement would be
Keith Forrester,

16:59.177 --> 17:01.978
42, plumber, grew up in Ridgewood.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.746
Withrow recently built

17:03.748 --> 17:07.550
a youth center there to, quote,
"Keep kids on the right path."

17:08.170 --> 17:09.986
Boy, Keith loves Withrow.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.477
Back to chambers.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.424
Did I say Andrew Withrow was heartless?

17:14.425 --> 17:17.593
No. I said that he had a heart of gold.

17:17.595 --> 17:18.771
18 karat gold

17:18.772 --> 17:20.849
that he skimmed from
one of his buildings.

17:20.852 --> 17:23.217
Motion to strike granted.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.263
Your Honor, we've found
that Juror Number Six

17:27.266 --> 17:29.667
has been leaking information
to the press.

17:29.669 --> 17:31.635
Come on.

17:31.637 --> 17:35.773
My. Is that Juror
Number Six talking to Misty Marx

17:35.775 --> 17:37.274
from the Ledger?

17:37.276 --> 17:38.643
Motion granted.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.813
Now if that's all... and it better be...

17:42.815 --> 17:44.615
we can resume the trial?

17:45.250 --> 17:46.884
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:46.886 --> 17:48.786
I'll get Withrow to restore your power.

17:48.788 --> 17:49.987
Can he do it personally?

17:49.989 --> 17:52.723
I know how he loves to be hands-on.

17:52.725 --> 17:54.825
You know, the second alternate,
Keith Forrester...

17:54.827 --> 17:56.694
he's going to win this trial for me.

17:56.696 --> 17:59.397
And you thinking that is
gonna win the trial for me.

17:59.399 --> 18:00.798
So where is this going?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.199
The trial?

18:02.201 --> 18:03.653
Us.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.104
How about dinner?

18:08.236 --> 18:10.307
Drinks at your place.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.375
Better.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.850
Sean? Sean, hi. I'm Danny.

18:20.863 --> 18:23.401
I'm investigating the skybridge
collapse at Withrow Midtown.

18:24.355 --> 18:26.857
I already told the U.S. Attorney
everything I know.

18:26.859 --> 18:28.225
Well, there's something you should know.

18:28.227 --> 18:29.133
Withrow is planning

18:29.135 --> 18:32.363
on bringing this whole thing
down on you in court. Hey.

18:32.365 --> 18:35.199
Sean, that's 15 counts of manslaughter.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.268
You knew about
the design flaw, didn't you?

18:37.270 --> 18:39.637
You're too good at your job.
You had to know.

18:40.259 --> 18:42.640
If I testify,
it's suicide for my career.

18:42.642 --> 18:45.209
Yeah, but if you don't,
you could end up in jail.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.079
He protects his people.

18:48.081 --> 18:51.015
Yeah? Like he protected
those people on the bridge?

18:56.089 --> 18:57.655
You can make this right.

19:05.902 --> 19:07.698
If that building were invisible,

19:07.700 --> 19:09.960
you'd be able to see
the Empire State Building.

19:09.962 --> 19:13.013
And it's pronounced "House-ton" Street,

19:13.015 --> 19:14.434
not "Houston."

19:15.938 --> 19:18.610
You can tell that to Sam Houston.

19:19.545 --> 19:20.845
You know, there's nothing like a view

19:20.847 --> 19:22.179
to give you some perspective.

19:23.883 --> 19:26.150
I like my small town, but...

19:26.618 --> 19:28.853
this has its charms.

19:28.855 --> 19:30.921
Well, you're a long
way from home, Dorothy.

19:30.923 --> 19:33.706
Bless your heart.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.461
By... by the decorating you've done,

19:37.463 --> 19:39.463
I'd say that you are, too.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.565
Well, we both...

19:41.567 --> 19:44.373
live in our work, don't we?

19:45.327 --> 19:48.272
Well, Withrow seems to think that,

19:48.274 --> 19:49.807
I should be working here.

19:49.809 --> 19:51.375
Smart man.

19:51.377 --> 19:53.410
You admire him.

19:54.090 --> 19:57.348
Well, I suppose he is brilliant,
charming and powerful.

19:57.350 --> 19:58.983
What's not to admire?

19:58.985 --> 20:00.951
I'm old-fashioned.

20:00.953 --> 20:04.188
I'm drawn to ambitious and talented men.

20:04.190 --> 20:08.058
Not all talented and ambitious
men are built the same.

20:23.979 --> 20:26.243
I have to go.

20:26.245 --> 20:27.576
No.

20:28.281 --> 20:29.987
Stay.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.921
It's tempting.

20:37.827 --> 20:38.956
But it's work.

20:42.662 --> 20:44.695
Bye, Jason.

20:56.776 --> 20:59.276
Now you've gone too far.

21:08.386 --> 21:10.419
Power's on. But my key card

21:10.421 --> 21:11.953
wouldn't work in the elevator.

21:11.955 --> 21:14.030
22 flights of stairs.

21:14.057 --> 21:15.557
Gets the blood flowing.

21:15.559 --> 21:17.492
TAC is back.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.047
Well, aren't you
the undaunted one today.

21:19.049 --> 21:20.320
Good morning.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.564
Um, did you sleep here last night?

21:22.566 --> 21:25.354
There's lots to do if we're
gonna bring down Withrow.

21:25.374 --> 21:29.343
Well, we lost two jurors
to Diana's gag with the boxes,

21:29.345 --> 21:31.645
but gained one back
when we went to the alternate.

21:31.647 --> 21:33.747
Still, we are in trouble, Bull.

21:33.749 --> 21:36.250
Nine want to acquit Withrow.

21:36.831 --> 21:38.852
We have to adjust our narrative.

21:39.389 --> 21:41.488
As a kid, I-I always dreamed

21:41.490 --> 21:43.342
of moving to New York,

21:43.344 --> 21:45.059
home of the greatest skyline
in the world.

21:45.061 --> 21:47.027
And, I remember thinking,

21:47.029 --> 21:48.553
- one day...
- All right.

21:49.131 --> 21:51.365
See how his eyes don't move
when he smiles?

21:52.064 --> 21:54.001
His actions are completely disassociated

21:54.003 --> 21:55.335
from his emotions.

21:55.337 --> 21:57.871
It's not that Withrow's
responsible for a mistake.

21:57.873 --> 22:01.742
Withrow made a cold,
calculated decision.

22:01.744 --> 22:04.311
So if your assessment is
that Withrow is a sociopath,

22:04.313 --> 22:05.646
he doesn't have the capacity

22:05.648 --> 22:07.314
to feel for the victims.

22:07.316 --> 22:10.818
The only risk he
considered was liability.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.253
We can use that.

22:13.255 --> 22:15.155
He won't take the stand.

22:17.231 --> 22:18.892
We'll see.

22:23.566 --> 22:24.965
Easy.

22:25.364 --> 22:26.182
Yeah?

22:26.184 --> 22:27.184
Yeah.

22:31.822 --> 22:33.040
We're not getting any younger?

22:33.042 --> 22:35.075
Heck, no.

22:35.835 --> 22:37.644
I've been meaning to ask you something.

22:37.646 --> 22:40.954
As long as it doesn't start with
"I left the file in my car."

22:40.956 --> 22:42.116
No.

22:42.118 --> 22:43.117
Go ahead.

22:43.119 --> 22:44.885
Got a letter a few weeks ago

22:44.887 --> 22:46.753
from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

22:47.456 --> 22:49.256
They...

22:49.526 --> 22:51.558
they're opening up
an investigation on me.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.593
Benny,

22:53.205 --> 22:55.362
this is not a conversation we can have.

22:55.364 --> 22:57.831
Even if I knew any details,

22:57.833 --> 22:59.233
I can't disclose.

22:59.647 --> 23:01.468
- Yeah, yeah.
- You understand?

23:01.470 --> 23:02.536
It's nothing personal.

23:02.538 --> 23:03.538
Yeah.

23:04.214 --> 23:05.873
All right.

23:06.709 --> 23:09.423
Three more flights to go.

23:12.597 --> 23:13.763
Hello?

23:13.788 --> 23:15.054
Ms. James?

23:15.559 --> 23:16.750
Hi.

23:16.752 --> 23:18.585
Mr. Laheri?

23:19.288 --> 23:21.863
So, let's talk.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.926
This past year, my wife and I separated.

23:26.449 --> 23:27.861
I've lost friends.

23:27.863 --> 23:31.265
With what I saw, I feel
like a different person.

23:31.267 --> 23:32.921
You saw the collapse?

23:33.769 --> 23:35.269
Right after.

23:35.271 --> 23:38.705
Their bodies being taken away.

23:38.707 --> 23:40.240
I need... pills

23:40.242 --> 23:42.609
just to get to sleep, you know?

23:42.611 --> 23:45.345
Because you know something
about why it happened?

23:46.319 --> 23:49.550
I inspected the bridge
a month before we opened.

23:49.552 --> 23:51.385
I knew there was a problem.

23:52.383 --> 23:54.321
I went to his office and told him.

23:54.664 --> 23:56.423
He promised me he would fix it.

23:56.425 --> 23:58.008
But he didn't.

24:00.362 --> 24:02.863
The day after he was indicted, I...

24:03.398 --> 24:06.266
I had five lawyers in my office.

24:07.299 --> 24:11.038
They gave me a $200,000 bonus
to shut up.

24:14.407 --> 24:15.934
And I did.

24:18.014 --> 24:19.580
You have to testify.

24:22.175 --> 24:24.284
I don't want to relive it.

24:25.334 --> 24:27.254
But, Sean, you already are.

24:28.524 --> 24:30.095
Every day.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.874
I see you got yourself
a new mirror jury.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.843
How can you tell?

24:49.845 --> 24:51.945
The watches kind of gave it away.

24:51.947 --> 24:53.146
Really?

24:53.148 --> 24:54.615
Maybe there was a sale.

24:54.617 --> 24:56.750
Would you like one?
We've got a million of 'em.

24:56.752 --> 24:58.252
Not really my style.

24:58.254 --> 25:00.120
- Jason.
- Andrew.

25:00.122 --> 25:02.055
What a great day for a conviction.

25:02.057 --> 25:03.890
Well, you'll need more
than fancy screens

25:03.892 --> 25:05.325
and algorithms to beat us.

25:05.327 --> 25:07.227
I know.

25:07.229 --> 25:08.829
All rise.

25:14.737 --> 25:16.436
Your Honor, the prosecution

25:16.438 --> 25:18.405
would like to call Sean Laheri

25:18.407 --> 25:19.635
to the stand.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.579
Mr. Laheri,

25:25.581 --> 25:27.781
as project manager at Withrow Midtown,

25:27.783 --> 25:29.783
did you notice any mistakes

25:29.785 --> 25:31.918
with the construction of the skybridge?

25:31.920 --> 25:34.755
I did. I walked through the designs

25:34.757 --> 25:36.823
a few weeks before we
were slated to open

25:36.825 --> 25:39.359
and noticed a flaw in the supports.

25:39.361 --> 25:41.762
And did you make Mr.
Withrow aware of this?

25:44.366 --> 25:45.532
Yes.

25:45.890 --> 25:47.942
On two separate occasions.

25:49.366 --> 25:50.537
I'm sorry,

25:50.539 --> 25:52.239
would you mind repeating that?

25:52.766 --> 25:54.574
Yes.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.610
I talked to Mr. Withrow

25:57.055 --> 25:59.079
on two separate occasions

25:59.081 --> 26:01.181
about the risk of changing materials

26:01.183 --> 26:02.949
to make our deadline.

26:03.342 --> 26:05.252
- Thank you, Mr. Laheri.
- He was paid off for this.

26:05.254 --> 26:07.387
I-I know this takes a lot of courage.

26:08.757 --> 26:10.557
Now, can you tell us...

26:10.559 --> 26:12.659
Your Honor, may I approach?

26:12.661 --> 26:15.262
Withrow's looking for a plea.

26:17.566 --> 26:19.733
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a continuance.

26:23.564 --> 26:26.573
150 months.

26:26.575 --> 26:28.508
Parole after 84.

26:28.510 --> 26:29.776
Be reasonable.

26:29.778 --> 26:31.411
My client is a developer,

26:31.413 --> 26:32.579
not a hit man.

26:32.581 --> 26:34.181
Minimum security.

26:34.183 --> 26:36.950
And if you don't like this
offer, we can go back to court,

26:36.952 --> 26:38.919
let the jury decide what the sentence is

26:38.921 --> 26:40.631
for 15 deaths.

26:49.732 --> 26:52.299
Okay,
minimum security. 60 months.

26:52.301 --> 26:54.234
Parole after 36.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.241
I will draw up the waiver of rights.

27:01.243 --> 27:03.803
We'll present it to Judge Levy tomorrow.

27:07.649 --> 27:09.349
This isn't over.

27:09.351 --> 27:12.152
Not for at least another five years.

27:21.005 --> 27:22.229
What's wrong?

27:22.231 --> 27:23.830
You won.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.432
Diana.

27:30.239 --> 27:32.305
Um, I have to take this.

27:32.307 --> 27:33.940
Work.

27:34.287 --> 27:35.675
I get it.

27:39.338 --> 27:40.814
Yes, Danny?

27:40.816 --> 27:42.315
I'm at Sean Laheri's, Bull.

27:42.317 --> 27:43.850
I need you over here.

28:12.594 --> 28:13.891
How we doing?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.533
Just left him 30 minutes ago.

28:15.558 --> 28:17.097
Not good.

28:17.099 --> 28:18.662
So, big surprise.

28:18.702 --> 28:20.368
Withrow pulled his plea deal.

28:20.370 --> 28:22.637
We're going back to court.

28:23.807 --> 28:25.807
Sean left a suicide note.

28:26.435 --> 28:27.975
He said he couldn't live with himself.

28:27.977 --> 28:30.144
The 15 lives.

28:30.146 --> 28:33.147
I thought he was testifying
to alleviate his guilt.

28:33.149 --> 28:34.923
I should have seen this coming.

28:35.418 --> 28:36.918
Was it his gun?

28:36.920 --> 28:38.886
Yes.

28:38.888 --> 28:40.331
What are you implying?

28:41.358 --> 28:42.924
I don't know, I just should've known

28:42.926 --> 28:44.959
what Withrow was capable of.

28:44.961 --> 28:47.562
You think Withrow had him killed?

28:47.564 --> 28:50.498
It seems a little
too convenient, doesn't it?

28:50.500 --> 28:54.669
ESU hasn't found any evidence
of forced entry, foul play,

28:54.671 --> 28:56.871
witnesses, sounds of struggle.

28:56.873 --> 28:58.651
The evidence is Sean.

29:00.009 --> 29:03.544
Testifying was the hardest
thing he's ever done.

29:03.833 --> 29:07.548
It was a source of pride, not shame.

29:07.550 --> 29:09.387
He didn't kill himself.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.221
As the defense
wasn't able to cross Mr. Laheri,

29:13.223 --> 29:15.356
you're to disregard his testimony.

29:15.358 --> 29:17.291
Your Honor, I beg you to reconsider.

29:17.293 --> 29:18.993
We all heard what Mr. Laheri said.

29:18.995 --> 29:20.128
Now he's dead.

29:20.130 --> 29:22.029
That's prejudicial and irrelevant.

29:22.031 --> 29:23.598
There is absolutely no correlation

29:23.600 --> 29:25.867
- between the two of them.
- No correlation between Sean's death

29:25.869 --> 29:27.268
- and Withrow, Really?
- Dr. Bull?

29:27.270 --> 29:28.536
He committed suicide, Your Honor.

29:28.538 --> 29:29.904
Who knows why?

29:29.906 --> 29:32.039
I think the defendant knows why.
Right, Withrow?

29:32.041 --> 29:34.142
Dr. Bull, one more word from you,

29:34.144 --> 29:35.510
and you'll spend the night in jail.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.577
My apologies, sir.

29:36.579 --> 29:37.845
Members of the jury,

29:37.847 --> 29:41.163
you are not to question
Mr. Laheri's absence.

29:41.165 --> 29:43.351
His testimony was removed
from the record.

29:43.353 --> 29:45.811
It does not reflect on the defendant.

29:45.813 --> 29:49.557
You are also to disregard
any exchange between counsel

29:49.559 --> 29:51.926
and Dr. Bull.

29:51.928 --> 29:53.227
We're screwed.

29:53.229 --> 29:54.896
We're out of witnesses.

29:54.898 --> 29:56.806
I have to rest our case.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.868
Something Sean said stuck with me.

30:00.870 --> 30:04.138
He said he warned Withrow in person.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.740
You don't get an audience with Withrow

30:05.742 --> 30:07.608
and a visit from five of his attorneys

30:07.610 --> 30:08.813
without something in writing.

30:08.815 --> 30:11.145
The FBI spent a year
scanning his e-mail chains.

30:11.147 --> 30:13.059
Servers, deleted files, everything.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.239
But we haven't.

30:14.676 --> 30:18.052
CEO's often write
to their colleagues in code,

30:18.054 --> 30:19.954
so their e-mails don't get flagged.

30:19.956 --> 30:21.989
I've got my people
poring over his correspondence

30:21.991 --> 30:23.758
looking for patterns,

30:23.760 --> 30:25.030
and they're gonna find something.

30:25.032 --> 30:29.096
And when they do, we're
gonna nail that son of a bitch.

30:31.968 --> 30:33.401
Thought you could use this.

30:33.403 --> 30:35.269
Way ahead of you.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.439
Rough day.

30:40.877 --> 30:42.510
Rough day for us.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.849
Brought you a revised
witness list for tomorrow.

30:47.851 --> 30:49.484
Well, thank you.

30:49.486 --> 30:50.451
You're welcome.

30:50.453 --> 30:51.552
Cheers.

30:51.554 --> 30:52.854
Thank you.

30:52.856 --> 30:54.956
It's a nice couch.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.594
Andrew Withrow's taking the stand.

30:59.596 --> 31:02.830
Don't act so surprised...
you goaded him into it.

31:02.832 --> 31:04.866
Did I?

31:04.897 --> 31:07.368
Well... by making him think

31:07.370 --> 31:09.971
that the jury will connect
him to Laheri's death.

31:10.293 --> 31:11.806
They will.

31:11.808 --> 31:14.242
Andrew Withrow has a lot
of questionable qualities,

31:14.244 --> 31:15.843
but he's not a murderer.

31:15.845 --> 31:17.945
And who are you trying to convince?

31:18.581 --> 31:19.918
Don't be ridiculous.

31:21.184 --> 31:24.452
You bring me the witness list in person?

31:24.726 --> 31:25.920
Come on, Diana.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.690
Jason, Laheri committed suicide.

31:29.692 --> 31:32.293
He felt guilty about the skybridge.

31:38.002 --> 31:40.535
I wish I could tell you
everything's gonna be okay

31:40.537 --> 31:42.946
and that your client isn't a killer.

31:44.941 --> 31:46.378
But I can't.

31:48.811 --> 31:50.220
I wish I could.

31:51.014 --> 31:52.485
For you.

32:12.936 --> 32:14.468
I'll see you in court.

32:14.470 --> 32:16.003
Yeah.

32:25.415 --> 32:26.881
Any new documents?

32:27.428 --> 32:29.334
Still looking.

32:30.653 --> 32:32.244
Look, Dennis,

32:32.589 --> 32:36.991
I was out of line asking you
about the investigation.

32:36.993 --> 32:39.994
But I hope that we can put it behind us,

32:39.996 --> 32:42.263
because I want to win this.

32:42.265 --> 32:43.998
And I want you to win this

32:44.000 --> 32:47.201
and not let anything else
stand in the way.

32:47.203 --> 32:50.404
Withrow's gonna take the stand,
and we have a strategy.

32:50.406 --> 32:54.208
He is a sociopath,
completely egocentric,

32:54.210 --> 32:57.511
can't read others' signals, and
can't conceive he could fail.

32:59.329 --> 33:01.195
There was a time...

33:01.417 --> 33:05.453
when I was involved in every detail.

33:05.455 --> 33:09.123
But, my company grew,
and at a certain point

33:09.125 --> 33:10.291
it became too large.

33:10.293 --> 33:11.459
So I had to begin

33:11.461 --> 33:14.495
trusting people,
like my project manager,

33:14.497 --> 33:16.097
Sean Laheri.

33:16.099 --> 33:19.233
I wish he'd come to me
instead of brushing

33:19.235 --> 33:20.768
this design flaw under the rug.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.103
If he had,

33:22.105 --> 33:25.806
those 15 poor people
would still be alive today.

33:25.808 --> 33:27.742
He'll throw the dead man
under the bus,

33:27.744 --> 33:31.161
just in case anyone on the jury
was listening to Sean.

33:31.163 --> 33:35.383
So Diana will coach him in what
we call a "modified mea culpa,"

33:35.385 --> 33:38.052
where Withrow admits
to something insignificant,

33:38.054 --> 33:41.262
so the jury will think that
he's sincere about everything.

33:41.264 --> 33:43.891
If there's a sin I've committed here,

33:43.893 --> 33:45.212
it's...

33:47.263 --> 33:50.264
slightly exaggerating my role.

33:50.266 --> 33:52.322
How do we get the jury
to see what he's really doing?

33:52.324 --> 33:56.437
Ha-ha! He doesn't really believe
what he's saying.

33:56.439 --> 33:58.305
Just keep pressing him.

33:58.307 --> 33:59.440
He'll admit it.

33:59.442 --> 34:00.975
Either you accept

34:00.977 --> 34:02.361
full responsibility

34:02.363 --> 34:04.738
for every decision made
at Withrow Midtown,

34:04.740 --> 34:07.481
or you were lying when you
said "the brick stops here."

34:07.483 --> 34:08.449
Which is it?

34:08.451 --> 34:09.717
Objection, Your Honor.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.652
Overruled.

34:14.023 --> 34:15.637
Let me try this again.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.458
Did you know the materials used

34:18.460 --> 34:20.661
might cause the skybridge to collapse,

34:20.663 --> 34:24.532
or is all this talk, your brand,

34:24.534 --> 34:27.268
built on a foundation of lies?

34:31.293 --> 34:34.261
I didn't know...

34:34.409 --> 34:37.908
about the skybridge problems.

34:37.933 --> 34:40.291
Mr. Withrow, when you signed
those documents...

34:40.315 --> 34:42.382
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

34:42.385 --> 34:44.110
Move on, Mr. Olsen.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.335
No further questions.

34:49.926 --> 34:52.893
We won a juror back...
we've now got eight on our side.

34:52.895 --> 34:54.195
Withrow didn't crack.

34:54.197 --> 34:56.777
Somehow he managed to
swallow his massive ego.

34:56.780 --> 34:59.467
Diana prepped him well,
interrupted at the right time.

34:59.469 --> 35:01.168
Yes, she did.

35:01.615 --> 35:03.738
Now we need a new line of attack.

35:04.601 --> 35:05.500
Dr. Bull.

35:05.588 --> 35:06.887
What is it, Foley?

35:06.912 --> 35:08.979
The, elevator cards are working.

35:09.568 --> 35:11.479
Good. Did you fix it?

35:11.481 --> 35:13.047
Not exactly.

35:19.789 --> 35:21.759
So this is TAC.

35:21.964 --> 35:24.297
Nice offices.

35:25.293 --> 35:26.827
Thanks. We got a good deal on them.

35:26.829 --> 35:28.829
Hopefully, no one skimped
on the materials.

35:29.832 --> 35:31.699
You and your team did good work.

35:31.701 --> 35:33.400
- Valuable work.
- Thanks.

35:33.402 --> 35:34.559
I like your shoes.

35:35.304 --> 35:38.472
I'm sorry, I thought we were
just exchanging compliments.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.875
We both know information's power.

35:40.877 --> 35:44.378
Not common information,
but unique information.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.314
Information no one else has.

35:47.316 --> 35:50.317
You use it to win trials;
I use it to build buildings.

35:50.319 --> 35:52.501
I see a synergy.

35:53.155 --> 35:55.990
I have dozens
of legal cases pending, and...

35:58.261 --> 36:00.494
I could use someone
like you, Dr. Bull.

36:03.966 --> 36:05.674
We can start...

36:06.736 --> 36:09.203
with a $10 million retainer.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.704
That's interesting.

36:10.706 --> 36:12.239
How'd you get to that number?

36:12.241 --> 36:13.440
Well, I looked at your finances,

36:13.442 --> 36:15.543
retainers, what you need

36:16.005 --> 36:19.299
to run TAC the way you like to run it.

36:19.301 --> 36:21.373
That is unique information.

36:22.318 --> 36:24.885
People like to think life is...

36:24.887 --> 36:28.923
intangible, that it... transcends worth.

36:29.693 --> 36:32.359
But I can put a number to anyone.

36:33.462 --> 36:36.430
My number is about finding out
what makes people tick,

36:36.432 --> 36:38.269
and...

36:39.235 --> 36:40.997
now that I have it...

36:41.771 --> 36:43.322
meeting's over.

36:48.485 --> 36:50.644
What a waste.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.516
Bye.

36:57.687 --> 36:59.331
Cable, where are you?

36:59.689 --> 37:01.322
Well, get in here.

37:01.347 --> 37:04.725
I think I found a new line of attack.

37:09.696 --> 37:11.295
Hey, Bull!

37:11.297 --> 37:12.873
I love it when you're right.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.220
First time for everything.

37:14.222 --> 37:16.804
So, I noticed a pattern
in Withrow's in-box.

37:16.838 --> 37:18.938
He frequently misspells "accept."

37:18.940 --> 37:21.974
It's common to confuse homonyms
when you use a dictation app.

37:21.976 --> 37:23.909
Son and sun, by and bye,

37:23.911 --> 37:25.511
except and accept.

37:25.513 --> 37:27.746
Skip to the good part...
the part where I'm right.

37:28.296 --> 37:31.417
Okay. So, the way the app works is

37:31.419 --> 37:32.918
you dictate your e-mail content,

37:32.920 --> 37:36.188
that gets sent to a server farm,
which translates it into text

37:36.190 --> 37:37.623
and sends it back.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.425
So the server farm stores
your dictations

37:39.427 --> 37:40.526
even if you delete them.

37:40.528 --> 37:42.333
And if someone were

37:42.335 --> 37:44.430
to hack into the server farm,
they might just find

37:44.432 --> 37:47.967
that Withrow dictated
a series of messages to...

37:47.969 --> 37:49.235
a Bridget Ingelhart.

37:50.538 --> 37:52.171
That's an actuarial sheet.

37:52.173 --> 37:55.174
Yeah. Well, Ms. Ingelhart
is an independent actuary.

37:55.176 --> 37:57.509
I mean... they use code in the e-mails,

37:57.511 --> 38:00.112
but the PDF is clear as day.

38:00.114 --> 38:02.514
She calculated the risk
of the skybridge falling.

38:02.516 --> 38:04.783
MARISSA; These numbers
are how much Withrow

38:04.785 --> 38:07.386
would have to pay victims
in a potential lawsuit.

38:07.388 --> 38:09.495
He found everyone's number.

38:10.224 --> 38:12.725
Why would Andrew Withrow
approve a flawed design

38:12.727 --> 38:14.159
for the skybridge?

38:14.161 --> 38:16.495
I mean, if there was a chance
that a disaster could happen,

38:16.497 --> 38:17.663
even a small chance...

38:19.200 --> 38:20.681
why risk it?

38:23.073 --> 38:25.237
Because time is money,

38:25.239 --> 38:27.773
and it would have cost tens of millions

38:27.775 --> 38:30.109
to dismantle the bridge and do it right.

38:30.111 --> 38:32.523
So Andrew Withrow calculated the odds.

38:32.953 --> 38:34.546
What were the chances of an accident,

38:34.548 --> 38:37.016
and how much would it cost

38:37.018 --> 38:39.985
if the unthinkable happened?

38:39.987 --> 38:42.187
It's how he evaluates human life.

38:42.189 --> 38:45.424
Andrew Withrow wants to know
how much it will cost him

38:45.669 --> 38:47.559
if he kills you.

38:49.597 --> 38:51.297
Can you wrap your head around that?

38:51.610 --> 38:52.698
You don't have to.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.733
Actuaries can.

38:54.735 --> 38:58.270
It's called risk assessment analysis,

38:58.272 --> 38:59.338
and it's used to determine

38:59.340 --> 39:00.906
the most cost-effective
course of action.

39:00.908 --> 39:02.107
Mr. Withrow

39:02.109 --> 39:03.943
gave everyone a number.

39:04.664 --> 39:05.945
A number that determined

39:05.947 --> 39:08.280
the value of their life.

39:08.608 --> 39:12.818
As you can see, a doctor
is worth more than a dentist,

39:12.820 --> 39:14.920
a dentist more than a teacher,

39:14.922 --> 39:17.423
a teacher more
than a commercial truck driver,

39:17.425 --> 39:19.058
and a driver...

39:19.060 --> 39:21.961
is worth more than a plumber.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.998
Why risk it?

39:27.045 --> 39:28.834
Because...

39:28.836 --> 39:34.039
Andrew Withrow decided that it
would be more cost-effective

39:34.041 --> 39:36.809
to lose those lives than to fix

39:36.811 --> 39:38.911
his faulty skybridge.

39:38.913 --> 39:40.546
That's why 15 people died

39:40.548 --> 39:42.095
at Withrow Midtown.

39:43.784 --> 39:45.217
Thank you.

39:49.824 --> 39:51.790
Has the jury reached a verdict?

39:51.792 --> 39:53.292
We have, Your Honor.

39:53.507 --> 39:56.962
On 15 counts of manslaughter,
we find the defendant...

39:57.539 --> 39:58.539
guilty.

40:00.134 --> 40:01.433
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

40:01.435 --> 40:04.385
the court thanks you for your service.

40:05.625 --> 40:06.724
Marshal,

40:06.974 --> 40:10.075
please place the defendant in custody.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.518
Looks like we got your number.

40:21.188 --> 40:24.023
Of course, I'll be appealing.

40:24.025 --> 40:25.657
Of course.

40:27.488 --> 40:28.894
Andrew, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to withdraw

40:28.896 --> 40:30.496
from your counsel.

40:30.498 --> 40:32.548
I can't help you moving forward.

40:33.415 --> 40:34.800
You already have.

40:34.802 --> 40:36.835
My grounds for appeal

40:36.837 --> 40:39.405
is collusion between my attorney

40:39.407 --> 40:42.608
and the legal advisor for the plaintiff.

40:43.878 --> 40:47.579
I'm very disappointed in both of you.

40:50.885 --> 40:53.610
I told you he was a sociopath.

40:56.090 --> 40:57.387
Benny.

40:58.955 --> 41:00.059
Thanks for your help.

41:00.061 --> 41:01.527
Hey.

41:01.529 --> 41:03.128
My pleasure.

41:03.130 --> 41:04.930
And I mean that.

41:04.932 --> 41:07.066
By the way, I...

41:07.585 --> 41:10.169
I took a look into that investigation.

41:11.639 --> 41:13.472
You did?

41:13.474 --> 41:16.041
Yeah, you didn't hear this from
me, but the U.S. Attorney's

41:16.043 --> 41:18.977
looking into a murder case you
prosecuted eight years ago.

41:18.979 --> 41:21.013
Hayden Watkins.

41:21.015 --> 41:22.848
Hayden Watkins.

41:36.263 --> 41:39.832
Well, if we're gonna be accused
of it, we might as well do it.

41:42.503 --> 41:44.120
Drinks?

41:46.707 --> 41:48.140
Dinner.

41:48.142 --> 41:49.908
My place?

41:50.778 --> 41:52.511
Better.
