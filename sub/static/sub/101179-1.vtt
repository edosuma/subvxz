00:35.049 --> 00:36.312
So.

00:38.488 --> 00:41.969
Henry is Norris' best
friend, all right?

00:43.362 --> 00:46.233
One day, he goes over
to Norris' house,

00:46.235 --> 00:48.452
Norris' wife, Andrea,
answers the door.

00:48.454 --> 00:50.411
Says "Hey, how you doin'?

00:50.413 --> 00:52.326
"Norris isn't home right now."

00:52.328 --> 00:54.066
He says, "Hey, how you doin'?"

00:54.068 --> 00:57.028
And proceeds to
take out $1000 cash.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.250
He says to Andrea,
"I always liked you.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.426
"How about I give you
this $1000 in cash,

01:05.428 --> 01:08.300
"and we go upstairs
before the man comes in."

01:09.823 --> 01:14.086
Andrea, now she's
looking at this $1000.

01:14.088 --> 01:18.092
Just like most of us,
she could use that cash.

01:19.790 --> 01:20.617
So they go upstairs.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.447
10, 15 minutes later
they come back down.

01:26.362 --> 01:30.627
Well, two hours or so,
Norris comes back home.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.804
Says, "Hey baby, how you doin'?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.546
"Henry come by here today?"

01:38.287 --> 01:41.244
Now, this
catches Andrea off guard.

01:41.246 --> 01:42.811
She's a little shaken.

01:42.813 --> 01:45.206
"Yeah, he was here earlier."

01:46.643 --> 01:48.469
Norris says, "Good,
he was bringing me

01:48.471 --> 01:50.732
"that $1000 he owes me."

01:52.301 --> 01:54.477
Wisper, you're
really fucked up, man.

01:56.305 --> 01:57.610
Ain't nothin' but a joke.

01:58.872 --> 02:00.437
Oh god, hello there, J.

02:00.439 --> 02:02.093
Chanel Four News.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.530
You mean to tell me you finally
got caught for something?

02:06.532 --> 02:09.359
Turn off the fuckin' camera!

02:09.360 --> 02:10.882
Nah, nah, it's
nothing like that.

02:10.883 --> 02:12.362
We're just shooting
something for posterity.

02:12.364 --> 02:14.582
Yeah, prosterity,
your prosterity.

02:14.584 --> 02:17.672
It's posterity, but I
get what you're saying.

02:17.674 --> 02:19.238
- Get you something there?
- All right man.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.503
Don't get me on that thing.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.068
What's the matter, Carter?

02:23.070 --> 02:23.810
You got something to hide?

02:25.334 --> 02:27.161
No sir, I just don't
like my picture taken.

02:28.293 --> 02:29.771
Okay, okay.

02:29.773 --> 02:30.817
Straight on him.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.123
Hey!

02:34.125 --> 02:35.646
Hey, how you doin' brother?

02:35.648 --> 02:37.126
She's quite the looker.

02:37.128 --> 02:38.606
Hey yeah you
know, that's Laura.

02:38.608 --> 02:39.609
She's an old friend.

02:41.088 --> 02:42.305
She knows what to
do with that camera.

02:42.307 --> 02:43.306
- She does web designs.
- Hi.

02:43.308 --> 02:44.438
Yeah?

02:44.440 --> 02:46.004
So how is that son of yours?

02:46.006 --> 02:47.919
Oh man, he just got
a football scholarship.

02:47.921 --> 02:49.791
That is fantastic!

02:49.793 --> 02:51.358
Gonna be a defensive end!

02:51.360 --> 02:53.316
As long as he
ain't no tight end.

02:53.318 --> 02:54.188
Fuck you.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.626
You really gotta relax.

02:58.628 --> 02:59.368
You're gonna get high
blood pressure like that.

03:00.891 --> 03:02.588
Breathe a little bit,
you know what I mean?

03:04.155 --> 03:07.374
J, there's a couple
of them over there.

03:07.376 --> 03:09.376
A couple of them right here.

03:09.378 --> 03:10.507
I got 'em.

03:10.509 --> 03:11.682
Can we change the music?

03:11.684 --> 03:13.423
No, J loves his jazz.

03:13.425 --> 03:14.383
Get this.

03:15.601 --> 03:17.951
Kelp, you underage, get out.

03:19.649 --> 03:22.650
And you, you tell Uno,
ain't no dealing in my bar.

03:22.652 --> 03:23.651
Says who?

03:23.653 --> 03:25.261
Say me, mother fucker.

03:25.263 --> 03:26.218
Fuck you!

03:27.874 --> 03:29.483
Fuck me, huh?

03:29.485 --> 03:31.049
I told you.

03:31.051 --> 03:32.921
Ain't no dealing in
my establishment.

03:32.923 --> 03:35.227
I said it once, the
gun speaks next time.

03:35.229 --> 03:36.751
Get the fuck out.

03:36.753 --> 03:38.274
Bye.

03:38.276 --> 03:39.406
You're gonna get
what's coming to you.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.410
Yeah, that sounds good.

03:49.374 --> 03:50.895
That's not necessary

03:50.897 --> 03:52.203
but y'all keep going
though, it's fine.

03:54.858 --> 03:56.248
Everybody is safe,

little bit of happy

04:01.430 --> 04:02.429
with these losers.

04:02.431 --> 04:04.213
They just don't learn.

04:04.215 --> 04:05.388
Oh I was hoping you
wanted someone to play with.

04:05.390 --> 04:06.955
In my movie, well you see

04:06.957 --> 04:09.914
I'm the only star
of this here film.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.742
Say thought why don't you leave

04:11.744 --> 04:15.180

your bra size, oh really.

You know what, just make that
your name and your number.

04:17.184 --> 04:18.445
Oh okay.

04:18.447 --> 04:19.880
I'll be right with you.

04:19.882 --> 04:22.274
Delete, hmm, come on.

04:22.276 --> 04:23.450
Yo boss.

04:23.452 --> 04:24.799
Those kids'll never learn.

04:24.801 --> 04:25.626
Get you something?

04:25.628 --> 04:26.453
Nah, I'm good.

Yeah, appreciate it.

04:31.068 --> 04:32.067
My man.

04:32.069 --> 04:32.722
Off to the Oasis.

04:35.507 --> 04:37.028
Yeah!

04:37.030 --> 04:37.944
Apollo!

04:40.251 --> 04:41.513
Here we are.

04:48.259 --> 04:50.607
Yup, hey everyone.

04:50.609 --> 04:52.087
Josiah in the house.

04:52.089 --> 04:53.828
Gee, thanks
for waiting, J.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.090
Billy boy!

04:55.092 --> 04:56.700
How you doing?

04:56.702 --> 04:58.487
Hey, all right.

04:59.575 --> 05:00.574
What's up?

05:00.576 --> 05:01.444
Shit.

05:01.446 --> 05:03.228
Father!

05:03.230 --> 05:05.013
Does your bishop know
you're in my establishment?

05:05.015 --> 05:06.493
Indeed he does.

05:06.495 --> 05:08.538
I gotta find my audience.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.670
So get to work.

05:09.672 --> 05:10.499
Shh.

05:11.935 --> 05:13.761
But seriously, how's
your parish doing?

05:13.763 --> 05:15.806
This ain't exactly the richest
neighborhood in the world.

05:15.808 --> 05:19.418
The Lord always
finds a way to help.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.247
Yeah he does.

05:24.469 --> 05:26.689
Oh, God bless you Josiah.

05:27.777 --> 05:29.387
Appreciate, appreciate.

05:35.872 --> 05:37.961
Oh, you know what I like.

05:40.224 --> 05:42.354
So he's behaving himself?

05:42.356 --> 05:44.184
When he
ain't hammin' it out.

05:45.577 --> 05:47.666
Baby, this is my
ace camera girl Laura.

05:48.537 --> 05:50.188
This is Melonie.

05:50.190 --> 05:51.799
She's my Special
Projects Manager.

05:51.801 --> 05:53.278
Really?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.021
So what project she manage?

05:58.634 --> 05:59.548
I'm just kidding.

06:00.592 --> 06:01.765
Get you something, honey?

06:01.767 --> 06:02.986
I'm set, thanks.

06:05.292 --> 06:06.074
Josiah?

06:06.076 --> 06:07.249
Hmm.

06:07.251 --> 06:08.076
- Come here.
- Okay.

06:08.078 --> 06:09.077
Be right there.

06:09.079 --> 06:10.208
What's up, brother?

06:10.210 --> 06:11.560
- All right.
- How you doin'?

06:14.127 --> 06:16.475
It's a nice good night
for a weeknight, huh?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.302
Mhmm.

06:17.304 --> 06:19.130
So I'm home?

06:19.132 --> 06:22.569
Movie yeah, I'm just
planning to make tonight.

06:22.571 --> 06:24.527
- Okay.
- Appreciate it.

06:24.529 --> 06:25.356
So.

06:27.227 --> 06:28.707
How's it going so far, really?

06:29.839 --> 06:31.621
We need some other family.

06:31.623 --> 06:33.188
The kids, that makes sense.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.279
Yeah, little family time.

06:37.411 --> 06:39.762
So I can, I'll set that up.

06:41.241 --> 06:43.111
But you know, we're done
here, you can go home.

06:43.113 --> 06:43.938
Okay.

06:43.940 --> 06:44.941
All right.

06:48.031 --> 06:49.162
Manager, manager?

06:50.599 --> 06:52.860
You're not pissed off
at me or anything?

06:52.862 --> 06:55.079
This has been a
long and busy day.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.298
Plus I don't know
if I wanna be a part

06:56.300 --> 06:57.604
of your little movie.

06:57.606 --> 06:59.562
Just having a little fun.

06:59.564 --> 07:01.653
I'm not really planning on
keeping all night, anyway.

07:04.874 --> 07:06.438
Enough.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.397
So you know, Willy's
closing at Lion's Den.

07:08.399 --> 07:10.878
How about we get a pie
and go to your place?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.053
You think I'm really
gonna let you drive

07:12.055 --> 07:13.881
all the way to Jersey this late?

07:13.883 --> 07:16.492
Nah, I could always just bunk
up on your couch, you know?

07:16.494 --> 07:19.451
J, you ain't never
sleep on nobody's couch.

07:19.453 --> 07:20.931
Enough.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.106
Come on, go home,
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:22.108 --> 07:22.935
Okay.

07:36.209 --> 07:37.644
This stuff come in
from Antonio's okay?

07:37.646 --> 07:38.516
Got it, boss.

07:39.604 --> 07:41.256
All right, wanna drink?

07:41.258 --> 07:43.650
Willy did some coffee.

07:43.652 --> 07:45.695
So you ready for
some family stuff?

07:45.697 --> 07:47.305
Sure.

07:47.307 --> 07:48.916
Cool, I gotta stop
by my accountant

07:48.918 --> 07:50.657
and then we'll head
to Jersey, all right?

07:50.659 --> 07:51.875
Whenever you're ready.

07:51.877 --> 07:52.833
I'm ready, come on.

07:52.835 --> 07:54.356
Okay.

07:54.358 --> 07:55.836
All right, Willy.

07:55.838 --> 07:57.013
Don't know what
I'd do without you.

08:10.504 --> 08:11.331
Can we go faster?

08:25.955 --> 08:26.782
Turn it down.

08:28.392 --> 08:29.741
So this is the neighborhood.

08:32.831 --> 08:34.441
Look, look, make
sure you get her.

08:35.442 --> 08:36.269
Okay.

08:38.663 --> 08:40.054
Hey!

08:40.056 --> 08:41.142
Hey Miss Casale.

08:41.144 --> 08:41.971
Hey.

08:43.450 --> 08:44.756
Gotta love the neighbors.

08:45.714 --> 08:46.843
Treat me like that now,

08:46.845 --> 08:48.368
wait till I'm a billionaire.

08:50.762 --> 08:52.198
It's beautiful, J.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.867
Okay,
here we go.

09:10.477 --> 09:12.086
Daddy!

09:12.088 --> 09:13.435
Say hi to Laura.

09:13.437 --> 09:14.610
Hi.

09:14.612 --> 09:15.393
Hello, young man.

09:15.395 --> 09:16.917
Boom!

09:16.919 --> 09:18.614
What the hell
is she doing here?

09:18.616 --> 09:20.137
I'm doing

09:20.139 --> 09:21.138
- a video.
- In the kitchen, Josiah!

09:21.140 --> 09:22.139
I'll be with you in...

09:22.141 --> 09:23.314
In the kitchen!

09:23.316 --> 09:24.533
I'll be with you in a minute.

09:24.535 --> 09:26.056
Come on, come on.

09:26.058 --> 09:27.057
All right, go play in
your room, buddy, okay?

09:27.059 --> 09:28.191
Come on, come on.

09:29.627 --> 09:30.454
Jenine?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.802
Hey baby girl.

09:32.804 --> 09:34.325
Hi, Dad.

09:34.327 --> 09:36.850
This is Jenine, my good buddy

09:36.852 --> 09:38.460
and great soccer player.

09:38.462 --> 09:39.722
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:39.724 --> 09:40.549
How you doing?

09:40.551 --> 09:41.463
I'm good.

09:41.465 --> 09:42.290
All right.

09:42.292 --> 09:43.813
This is Laura.

09:43.815 --> 09:44.988
She's gonna be doing
some video of me.

09:44.990 --> 09:46.468
Oh maybe you can come in

09:46.470 --> 09:47.643
to our soccer
practice next week.

09:47.645 --> 09:49.210
The whole team can be in it.

09:49.212 --> 09:51.038
For you, we can
make that happen.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.039
We'll set something up
for next week, all right?

09:52.041 --> 09:53.214
Awesome, awesome.

09:53.216 --> 09:54.693
So what's up, how you been?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.825
Michael's been coming
in my room again.

09:55.827 --> 09:57.000
He says he doesn't but he does.

09:57.002 --> 09:59.133
Well, he is five years old.

09:59.135 --> 10:01.526
So, he goes through my stuff!

10:01.528 --> 10:03.137
I'll tell you what,
this is what you do.

10:03.139 --> 10:05.008
Remember what I did
in the back office?

10:05.010 --> 10:06.793
Set up your webcam

10:06.795 --> 10:07.881
and you're gonna
catch him in the act.

10:07.883 --> 10:09.447
Ah, I like that.

10:09.449 --> 10:11.449
Yeah, you catch
him red-handed,

10:11.451 --> 10:12.711
live in living color.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.843
Awesome.

10:13.845 --> 10:14.713
All right baby, I love you.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.540
See you.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.021
Come on.

10:19.198 --> 10:22.025
Shh, she's real
serious about it.

10:32.342 --> 10:35.084
Josiah,
close the door!

10:36.172 --> 10:36.997
This door wants to step on.

10:37.956 --> 10:39.044
God dammit.

10:41.177 --> 10:42.831
Hey, girl.

10:50.795 --> 10:52.275
Alisa, honey?

10:53.406 --> 10:55.232
I work late sometimes.

10:55.234 --> 10:57.236
And we live in Jersey and
it's a long drive from Harlem.

10:58.716 --> 11:01.021
And what do we
really have here?

11:01.023 --> 11:02.413
You gotta be kidding me.

11:02.415 --> 11:04.067
This is what you wanted, baby.

11:04.069 --> 11:06.113
You wanted out of that
tiny little apartment!

11:06.115 --> 11:07.592
I got us this big
beautiful house.

11:07.594 --> 11:09.072
You wanted the American dream

11:09.074 --> 11:11.248
and I delivered it to you!

11:11.250 --> 11:12.423
All I've got is
two hours of sleep

11:12.425 --> 11:13.250
and a house full of kids.

11:13.252 --> 11:14.077
Tell him.

11:14.079 --> 11:15.949
Not now.

11:15.951 --> 11:17.428
Still taking your raggedy
ass running around Harlem

11:17.430 --> 11:19.169
with that stupid fucking camera.

11:19.171 --> 11:21.434
Norma, just shut
the fuck up please.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.176
Laura, we don't need this.

11:26.178 --> 11:27.136
Goddamit, woman!

11:29.094 --> 11:31.444
Sis, sis, he ain't
never gonna get right.

11:34.273 --> 11:36.406
Look, sorry for back there.

11:37.624 --> 11:39.148
She wanted a big house.

11:41.063 --> 11:42.803
This all turned into
a fucking nightmare.

11:44.805 --> 11:45.632
You okay?

11:46.895 --> 11:48.720
Sure.

11:48.722 --> 11:50.722
Look, there's some
things we just don't need.

11:50.724 --> 11:52.637
Can you erase that
stuff back there?

11:52.639 --> 11:53.727
Absolutely.

11:55.468 --> 11:56.905
Back to the city, I guess.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.734
I got a couch.

12:02.432 --> 12:05.914
That's long gone, history.

12:07.306 --> 12:09.091
Tonight and all nights
erased and gone.

12:18.927 --> 12:20.970
Did you back up
yesterday's files?

12:20.972 --> 12:21.842
Yeah.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.933
That could be a start.

12:26.935 --> 12:28.978
It's still hot.

12:28.980 --> 12:29.979
- Hey.
- Sure thing,

12:29.981 --> 12:30.849
be safe out there.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.678
I will.

12:37.032 --> 12:38.509
All right.

12:38.511 --> 12:39.684
Good to see you,
thanks for coming out.

12:39.686 --> 12:40.903
Thank you, all right, all right.

12:40.905 --> 12:41.732
Yes sir.

12:44.604 --> 12:46.169
The more money I give you,

12:46.171 --> 12:47.823
the less money my
aunt's gonna get.

12:52.917 --> 12:56.571
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

12:56.573 --> 12:59.791
I just wanna thank you
all for coming out,

12:59.793 --> 13:02.011
specially for your
loyal support.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.231
I think I got a good shot of
winning the primary this year

13:04.233 --> 13:06.363
and I can guarantee you

13:06.365 --> 13:08.539
we'll make some big
changes here in Harlem.

13:10.543 --> 13:11.978
And you can count on it

13:11.980 --> 13:13.936
like money in the bank!

13:15.200 --> 13:17.548
All right, all right.

13:17.550 --> 13:19.115
Oh, more money, more money.

13:19.117 --> 13:21.552
All right, I hear you
my people, all right.

13:21.554 --> 13:24.251
It's all down to
collecting and drinking.

13:24.253 --> 13:27.038
You can call it a night.

13:28.344 --> 13:29.996
Sorry everybody.

13:29.998 --> 13:31.823
Enjoy the party.

13:31.825 --> 13:34.959
And a special thank
you to Josiah Wisper,

13:36.395 --> 13:38.308
for letting us throw
this little party,

13:38.310 --> 13:42.225
letting us throw this little
party right here in the Den.

13:42.227 --> 13:43.531
Thank you J.

13:43.533 --> 13:44.967
All right.

13:44.969 --> 13:46.621
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:46.623 --> 13:47.709
Thank you.

13:47.711 --> 13:48.884
Let me hear some noise,

13:48.886 --> 13:50.494
let me hear some noise, people!

13:50.496 --> 13:52.018
Man, you know we gonna do this.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.671
You know we gonna do this.

13:53.673 --> 13:54.672
My man.

13:54.674 --> 13:56.024
Congratulations.

13:59.331 --> 14:01.331
Bring me the glass.

14:04.075 --> 14:06.947
Yo yo,
bring me the glass.

14:14.259 --> 14:16.129
What are you
on, bankers hours?

14:16.131 --> 14:18.394
Hey, you're the one
paying me the big bucks.

14:19.699 --> 14:21.090
I'm going through our stuff.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.004
It's actually working
out real nice.

14:22.006 --> 14:23.266
I'm glad.

14:23.268 --> 14:24.746
Yeah.

14:24.748 --> 14:26.313
And what about
the wifey stuff?

14:26.315 --> 14:27.836
That's been history, baby.

14:27.838 --> 14:29.011
Good, good, good.

14:29.013 --> 14:30.012
Hey I gotta pay some rent.

14:30.014 --> 14:30.665
You wanna come with me?

14:30.667 --> 14:31.666
Sure.

14:31.668 --> 14:33.322
All right, let's go.

14:49.207 --> 14:51.383
So glad I don't
live here anymore.

14:56.432 --> 14:57.607
Make sure you get this.

14:58.434 --> 15:00.086
Big Leroy!

15:00.088 --> 15:01.609
How you doing, brother?

15:01.611 --> 15:02.784
Hey, I'm fine.

15:02.786 --> 15:06.744
All right.

15:06.746 --> 15:07.832
Get yourself something
good to eat, all right?

15:07.834 --> 15:09.617
Oh, thank you.

15:09.619 --> 15:10.618
Anytime man.

15:10.620 --> 15:11.749
Spend that on food.

15:11.751 --> 15:12.752
All right.

15:19.107 --> 15:19.933
What's up?

15:28.377 --> 15:29.204
Benny!

15:35.079 --> 15:37.342
Oh hi, Josiah,
I have it right here.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.258
Who is it?

15:43.914 --> 15:45.566
I'm sorry it's late.

15:45.568 --> 15:46.784
Thank you for understanding.

15:46.786 --> 15:48.308
Oh, no need.

15:48.310 --> 15:49.309
- Who is it, baby?
- How's your Ma?

15:49.311 --> 15:50.658
Oh she's much better.

15:50.660 --> 15:51.922
- Benny.
- Good, good, good.

15:55.317 --> 15:56.925
Is that yours?

15:56.927 --> 15:58.231
Yeah, yeah, it's
something for me.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.408
It's okay, no big deal.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.454
All right Benny,
here's your receipt.

16:04.195 --> 16:06.282
Thank you, Josiah.

16:06.284 --> 16:07.631
God bless you.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.459
In Jesus' name, God bless you.

16:09.461 --> 16:10.982
No need, but hey

16:10.984 --> 16:12.375
tell your mom I
said hi, all right?

16:12.377 --> 16:13.681
- I will.
- Benny who is it?

16:13.683 --> 16:15.552
Off we go to the next one.

16:15.554 --> 16:17.556
I bet you anything, he got
an excuse, he don't got it.

16:19.167 --> 16:19.993
Bryson!

16:21.473 --> 16:22.951
Boy you know damn well
there ain't no smoking

16:22.953 --> 16:24.692
in this building.

16:24.694 --> 16:26.433
Man, you seriously
got a problem with me.

16:26.435 --> 16:28.393
No, but you know why I'm here.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.872
You said next week.

16:30.874 --> 16:31.873
This is next week.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.050
Then next week.

16:34.486 --> 16:37.185
Tomorrow or your black
ass is in the street.

16:40.231 --> 16:41.274
I believe we're speaking
the same language.

16:41.276 --> 16:42.536
Yeah yeah, whatever.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.190
I will see you tomorrow.

16:44.192 --> 16:45.062
Come on Laura.

16:50.023 --> 16:51.414
Jenine's birthday's on Saturday.

16:51.416 --> 16:52.633
Can you make it?

16:52.635 --> 16:54.112
I don't know, J.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.244
I don't think the missus
likes me too much.

16:55.246 --> 16:57.072
Nah, birthdays are different.

16:57.074 --> 16:58.552
You're coming and
I'ma cover your time.

16:58.554 --> 17:00.556
Come on, let's get out of here.

17:07.214 --> 17:08.607
Saturday, June 4th.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.694
I wanna thank all of you

17:11.696 --> 17:13.306
for coming to
celebrate my baby girl.

17:13.308 --> 17:15.221
I'm sorry, you're not
my baby girl anymore,

17:15.223 --> 17:17.092
just seems like yesterday,
when you were a little baby

17:17.094 --> 17:18.963
and we was living in like
a little tiny apartment

17:18.964 --> 17:19.747
in the hood.

17:19.749 --> 17:21.314
Anyway.

17:21.316 --> 17:22.489
I wanna thank all
of you for coming

17:22.491 --> 17:24.317
to my daughter's birthday.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.971
And I turn the floor over
to the birthday girl.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.799
I'd like to thank
everyone for coming

17:28.801 --> 17:31.541
and mom and dad for a
fantastic birthday party.

17:31.543 --> 17:33.763
Most of all, I'd
like to thank God

17:35.243 --> 17:38.069
for my wonderful family,
this wonderful house,

17:38.071 --> 17:40.115
this wonderful neighborhood.

17:40.117 --> 17:41.595
Not a day goes by
without my thinking

17:41.597 --> 17:42.639
of how blessed we are.

17:42.641 --> 17:44.861
Mom, Dad, I love you.

17:52.042 --> 17:53.041
Happy birthday!

17:53.043 --> 17:55.130
Birthday, yeah.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.154
Happy birthday, Jenine.

18:19.156 --> 18:20.764
We're all so proud of you.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.549
That was a lovely
speech you gave.

18:22.551 --> 18:24.986
Josiah could not have asked
for a better daughter.

18:24.988 --> 18:26.727
I am so proud of my grandbaby.

18:26.729 --> 18:28.990
This is one of the
proudest days I have had.

18:28.992 --> 18:31.688
I can't wait to see
what she's gonna become.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.386
Happy birthday, Jenine.

18:33.388 --> 18:34.952
We love you so much.

18:34.954 --> 18:36.476
Sorry I'm late.

18:36.478 --> 18:38.304
Congratulations
on your birthday.

18:38.306 --> 18:40.218
Josiah couldn't have asked
for a better daughter.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.090
Well he
could have asked.

18:42.092 --> 18:43.961
Hey date, love you.

18:43.963 --> 18:45.485
You wanna share
some of that cake?

18:45.487 --> 18:47.008
No, you gonna
put that glass of

18:47.010 --> 18:48.009
- champagne down?
- No I'ma finish it.

18:48.011 --> 18:49.532
Why would I do that?

18:49.534 --> 18:51.404
I hope you have a
great time in college

18:51.406 --> 18:53.710
and thank you so much for
being the best sister ever.

18:53.712 --> 18:54.668
Isn't that right?

18:54.670 --> 18:56.147
Yeah.

18:56.149 --> 18:58.062
I just really
wanted to congratulate

18:58.064 --> 18:59.020
and thank Jenine for being
such an amazing role model

18:59.022 --> 19:00.500
all these years.

19:00.502 --> 19:02.284
Anyway I can't wait
to see what you're

19:02.286 --> 19:03.764
gonna do next, girl.

19:03.766 --> 19:04.634
Yeah, love peace
and happiness.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.462
Hi guys.

19:06.464 --> 19:08.899
Move over, I wanna wish
Jenine a happy birthday too!

19:08.901 --> 19:10.292
Happy birthday, Jenine!

19:10.294 --> 19:11.904
I love you, Jenine.

19:16.735 --> 19:17.821
You okay, baby?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.345
Yeah.

19:19.347 --> 19:20.520
Thanks Mom, that's it.

19:20.522 --> 19:21.740
Oh, shit it's late.

19:26.136 --> 19:27.442
I'm gonna go take
her home real quick.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.574
Baby girl, I'm sorry,
my little adult.

19:31.576 --> 19:32.836
I love you.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.577
Okay dad.

19:34.579 --> 19:36.187
I got something
special for you tomorrow.

19:36.189 --> 19:37.624
And you young lady,
let's get you home.

19:37.626 --> 19:38.409
Okay.

19:44.372 --> 19:45.808
J, stop speeding.

19:46.809 --> 19:47.634
I ain't speeding.

19:47.636 --> 19:48.811
I'm qualifying.

19:51.379 --> 19:53.422
Make sure to leave me
enough battery power.

19:53.424 --> 19:54.989
I'll pay you extra.

19:54.991 --> 19:55.859
Yeah, I
got a couple spares.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.688
Thanks.

20:03.478 --> 20:04.348
Damn.

20:06.437 --> 20:08.437
Oh come
on J, give me a break.

20:08.439 --> 20:11.224
Hey, that is no way to
treat an entrepreneur.

20:13.096 --> 20:16.880
Yeah yeah, fine, I
guess, you're right.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.710
Yeah, I try to be, you know.

20:20.843 --> 20:22.582
So how was the party?

20:22.584 --> 20:24.148
Great.

20:24.150 --> 20:24.975
I'm sorry you missed it.

20:24.977 --> 20:25.804
Yeah.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.938
I really doubt that.

20:34.596 --> 20:36.334
Are you gonna play
that thing all night?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.163
Excuse me?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.208
The camera.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.688
Ah, the camera.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.429
Yeah, the camera.

20:43.431 --> 20:48.436
No I wasn't planning on it.

20:50.394 --> 20:52.614
Hmm, what's this over here?

21:05.322 --> 21:06.149
I want you to leave the drink

21:07.455 --> 21:09.369
and bring your cannoli.

21:10.762 --> 21:12.677
Uh huh, uh huh, mhmm.

21:15.245 --> 21:17.334
Mmm-mmm, let me get that.

21:25.429 --> 21:27.473
That's right, Lieutenant.

21:27.475 --> 21:29.825
About 250, black
as a struck match.

21:31.130 --> 21:32.652
Just started dealing.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.264
Find him at 134th and Lennox.

21:36.048 --> 21:38.353
Keep me posted,
I'll do the same.

21:44.361 --> 21:46.230
Hup, eight o'clock, Laura.

21:46.232 --> 21:48.844
Let's check back at Oasis then

21:50.280 --> 21:51.107
head to Jersey.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.587
I wanna surprise Alisa.

21:54.589 --> 21:56.023
Call you up in half
an hour, right?

21:56.025 --> 21:57.241
Yeah, no problem, J.

21:57.243 --> 21:58.242
Let's go.

21:58.244 --> 21:59.548
Willy, small brother.

21:59.550 --> 22:00.420
Aight.

22:01.509 --> 22:03.511
Come on, let's go.

22:10.648 --> 22:12.084
Hello New Jersey.

22:24.967 --> 22:26.488
Shit.

22:26.490 --> 22:28.011
Damn Alisa, how many
times I have to tell you

22:28.013 --> 22:29.537
not to turn off
the porch lights?

22:40.809 --> 22:41.636
J?

22:43.115 --> 22:44.811
I have no idea
what's going on here

22:44.813 --> 22:46.205
but do not stop shooting.

22:49.339 --> 22:50.862
What the fuck is going on here?

24:44.367 --> 24:46.019
How many kids do you have?

24:46.021 --> 24:47.020
Three.

24:47.022 --> 24:48.066
And how old were they?

24:51.461 --> 24:52.460
Wisper!

24:52.462 --> 24:54.116
How old were your kids?!

24:57.032 --> 24:57.859
Penny's 16.

25:00.339 --> 25:02.559
And Jenine, she just turned 18.

25:05.605 --> 25:09.871
My little boy,
Michael was just five.

25:14.527 --> 25:17.050
Hey,
what is that for?

25:17.052 --> 25:18.225
It's fine, officer.

25:18.227 --> 25:19.663
She's just helping me out.

25:21.709 --> 25:23.578
Laura, stay on.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.669
Surveillance can help,
it's a small town.

25:27.105 --> 25:29.238
Cameras
everywhere these days.

25:40.423 --> 25:42.292
Breaker's squeak as
a clear for prints.

25:42.294 --> 25:44.079
Forensic's in the
other two rooms.

25:46.995 --> 25:48.431
How we doing in here?

25:49.519 --> 25:50.955
Single shot to the head.

25:52.522 --> 25:53.741
She never felt a thing.

25:59.442 --> 26:01.009
Hey, you okay?

26:02.314 --> 26:04.358
This kid loved ballet.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.535
My Casey does too.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.029
Hey.

26:23.031 --> 26:24.204
Yeah?

26:24.206 --> 26:25.727
You gonna take off tomorrow.

26:25.729 --> 26:26.946
Yeah, go spend some
time with your kids, go.

26:26.948 --> 26:28.730
No, no, I'm fine, sir.

26:28.732 --> 26:29.992
No, no, no, it's
not a suggestion.

26:29.994 --> 26:31.343
Not a suggestion, come on.

26:39.787 --> 26:40.916
I own a gun.

26:40.918 --> 26:42.091
38 revolver.

26:42.093 --> 26:44.354
I have a CCW for it.

26:44.356 --> 26:46.617
Yeah, the one in the
kitchen, we have it.

26:46.619 --> 26:48.141
It's never been fired.

26:48.143 --> 26:48.970
We know.

26:50.449 --> 26:53.407
You have a license to
carry that around, huh?

26:53.409 --> 26:54.887
Any other weapons we
should know about?

26:54.889 --> 26:55.759
No.

27:01.460 --> 27:03.288
Sir, I'm Detective Cardelli.

27:04.768 --> 27:06.246
Will you come back to
the station with us?

27:06.248 --> 27:07.682
We have some more
questions to ask you.

27:07.684 --> 27:08.511
It's routine.

27:11.862 --> 27:13.037
Yeah take him back now.

27:15.692 --> 27:16.954
It's fine, I got it.

27:27.573 --> 27:28.400
Carlisle!

27:30.315 --> 27:31.967
Hey, Cardelli.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.839
What's the situation?

27:33.841 --> 27:35.797
Mom and two of the kids
are bagged, ready to go.

27:35.799 --> 27:37.581
Thompson's working on the
little ballerina right now

27:37.583 --> 27:40.541
but guy's going all
chick flick up there.

27:40.543 --> 27:42.501
Come on, a little
respect, please!

27:44.329 --> 27:46.242
Listen soon as Wisper
hits tail lights

27:46.244 --> 27:48.201
tell them to start
bringing the bodies down.

27:48.203 --> 27:49.160
It's about time.

27:50.466 --> 27:51.902
Nice and discreet.

27:53.643 --> 27:55.340
I'm sorry, I'll have
them go ninja mode for you.

28:02.608 --> 28:03.435
Really?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.054
Whoah, media stays outside.

28:15.056 --> 28:16.969
But I'm not media.

28:16.971 --> 28:18.492
I don't care who you are,
you're not getting in here.

28:24.108 --> 28:26.152
This is just an
informal interview.

28:26.154 --> 28:28.023
This is Detective Archer.

28:28.025 --> 28:30.898
This is Detective Conlin from
the Prosecutor's Department.

28:31.942 --> 28:33.726
Oh, and Detective Thompson.

28:35.554 --> 28:38.555
It's a big crowd in here
for an informal interview.

28:38.557 --> 28:42.646
This is just routine
procedure, strictly voluntary.

28:42.648 --> 28:45.564
However, we do appreciate
your willingness to cooperate.

28:47.305 --> 28:49.349
Look, Josiah, we're
sorry about what happened

28:49.351 --> 28:50.916
to your family.

28:50.918 --> 28:52.918
We know this won't
be easy for you.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.791
We'll be as gentle
with you as possible.

28:58.055 --> 29:01.102
12:39 a.m., Wednesday
June 8th, 2016,

29:02.233 --> 29:04.061
interview with Josiah Wisper.

29:05.541 --> 29:07.760
You run the Lion's
Den Bar in Harlem?

29:09.023 --> 29:10.154
I own the Lion's Den.

29:11.329 --> 29:13.895
I also own the Oasis Bar,

29:13.897 --> 29:16.332
three apartment buildings
and a card store.

29:16.334 --> 29:17.681
Card store?

29:17.683 --> 29:18.944
Stationery.

29:18.946 --> 29:20.684
I sell stationery.

29:20.686 --> 29:22.425
A silent partner.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.819
Do you have any trouble
with any of those?

29:24.821 --> 29:26.690
Mostly the buildings.

29:26.692 --> 29:28.431
What kind of trouble?

29:28.433 --> 29:31.523
Poor regulations,
but I still make money.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.785
See your family earlier today?

29:34.787 --> 29:36.352
No.

29:36.354 --> 29:38.224
Just yesterday.

29:38.226 --> 29:40.530
I brought some stuff in from
the city in the afternoon.

29:40.532 --> 29:42.054
And that was the
last time you saw

29:42.056 --> 29:43.490
your entire family
before tonight?

29:43.492 --> 29:44.841
That's what I said.

29:45.929 --> 29:47.322
Any domestic problems, Josiah?

29:48.236 --> 29:49.150
Just the rent boy.

29:50.281 --> 29:51.498
With your family?

29:51.500 --> 29:52.847
No.

29:52.849 --> 29:53.979
Marriage okay?

29:53.981 --> 29:55.502
Sure.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.375
Kids have any problems
at school, neighbors?

29:58.811 --> 30:00.898
We're just a happy
suburban family.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.422
And yet you bought a home

30:02.424 --> 30:03.207
at a predominantly
white neighborhood.

30:04.643 --> 30:06.078
Purple neighborhood
was all filled up.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.036
What's your point, Detective?

30:08.038 --> 30:10.082
Look, you're legally
allowed to carry a sidearm

30:10.084 --> 30:12.912
in this state and we have
it with us for safekeeping.

30:14.305 --> 30:17.306
Now Josiah, are there
any other firearms

30:17.308 --> 30:19.221
that you didn't
mention to us about,

30:19.223 --> 30:21.484
you know, maybe it slipped
your mind earlier tonight.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.791
Just the one I legally carry.

30:23.793 --> 30:25.271
It was handed over
to your department

30:25.273 --> 30:26.752
out of my own free will.

30:28.580 --> 30:31.146
I thought you said this was
just an informal interview.

30:31.148 --> 30:32.106
That's correct.

30:33.716 --> 30:35.977
A crowd of neighbors
have quickly gathered

30:35.979 --> 30:39.328
outside the house where this
terrible tragedy took place

30:39.330 --> 30:40.462
only a short time ago.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.985
Okay if I ask you
a few questions, Mrs?

30:43.987 --> 30:46.292
Kowalski, Irene Kowalski.

30:46.294 --> 30:48.033
Thank you Mrs. Kowalski.

30:48.035 --> 30:49.991
Mrs. Kowalski, how
long have you known

30:49.993 --> 30:51.471
your neighbors
across the street?

30:51.473 --> 30:53.168
Oh I don't know them really.

30:53.170 --> 30:55.040
They only moved in
about a year ago.

30:55.042 --> 30:56.432
Are you surprised
about something

30:56.434 --> 30:57.694
like this happening here?

30:57.696 --> 30:59.568
No, not really.

31:02.397 --> 31:04.875
Josiah, you get along
with your wife's family?

31:04.877 --> 31:06.749
She just got a sister, Norma.

31:08.098 --> 31:10.229
Real pain in the
ass, but she's family

31:10.231 --> 31:12.492
so I don't have much
choice in the matter.

31:12.494 --> 31:14.276
What about your family?

31:14.278 --> 31:16.628
I've got an older
brother Curtis, he's okay.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.544
And Momma, she's still alive.

31:21.242 --> 31:23.068
Your momma still alive?

31:23.070 --> 31:24.982
No.

31:24.984 --> 31:25.983
What'd you do after you left
your home Monday afternoon?

31:25.985 --> 31:27.681
My usual routine.

31:27.683 --> 31:29.074
I drove into Harlem
and made the rounds

31:29.076 --> 31:30.120
of my businesses.

31:32.166 --> 31:34.688
And yeah I called Alisa later,

31:34.690 --> 31:36.039
went straight to voicemail.

31:37.388 --> 31:39.214
Didn't think
that was a problem?

31:39.216 --> 31:41.434
She was a busy woman
with her own things to do.

31:41.436 --> 31:43.088
Continue please.

31:43.090 --> 31:44.265
Not much else.

31:46.093 --> 31:48.878
Caught up on paperwork and
went back to the Oasis.

31:51.359 --> 31:52.967
After I dropped off Laura

31:52.969 --> 31:55.187
I went to meet up with
Melonie at her place.

31:55.189 --> 31:56.884
Who's Melonie?

31:56.886 --> 31:58.059
Melonie Burton.

31:58.061 --> 32:00.192
She manages for me sometimes.

32:00.194 --> 32:02.107
We had to go over some
estimates for repairs.

32:02.109 --> 32:05.936
She also helps me with
my outside appointments.

32:05.938 --> 32:06.763
And?

32:06.765 --> 32:08.243
It was late.

32:08.245 --> 32:09.418
I didn't feel like
driving back to Jersey

32:09.420 --> 32:10.247
so I crashed at Melonie's place.

32:12.119 --> 32:14.771
Then in the morning, I went
to meet with my accountant.

32:14.773 --> 32:15.946
What else?

32:15.948 --> 32:17.165
Went back to Lion's Den,

32:17.167 --> 32:18.775
did some more paperwork,

32:18.777 --> 32:21.561
collected some rent at
one of my buildings.

32:21.563 --> 32:23.737
Went back to Lion's, I
worked a few more hours

32:23.739 --> 32:25.958
then drove home to Jersey.

32:27.221 --> 32:29.395
With a gift for your wife.

32:29.397 --> 32:31.442
I buy things for
her from time to time.

32:32.878 --> 32:35.227
Just what is your
relation to Miss Barton?

32:35.229 --> 32:36.099
Burton.

32:37.144 --> 32:39.622
She's an employee, I told you.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.147
She manages Oasis Bar.

32:42.149 --> 32:43.496
Did you go out
with her socially?

32:43.498 --> 32:44.714
We're friends.

32:44.716 --> 32:45.715
Friends?

32:45.717 --> 32:47.195
Yes.

32:47.197 --> 32:48.631
Are you having
an affair with her?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.372
We've had our times.

32:50.374 --> 32:52.331
Your wife was aware of that?

32:52.333 --> 32:53.160
Alisa knows.

32:54.726 --> 32:55.684
She knew.

32:57.164 --> 33:00.165
Was she concerned about it?

33:00.167 --> 33:02.079
Was she concerned
about anything at all?

33:02.081 --> 33:05.648
Yeah, she wanted me to
get out of the bar business.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.215
Why was that?

33:07.217 --> 33:08.740
The late nights, long hours.

33:10.002 --> 33:11.439
She thought it was dangerous.

33:12.353 --> 33:14.222
She worried about me.

33:14.224 --> 33:16.531
She wasn't worried about
you fucking other women?

33:18.533 --> 33:20.361
She knew me before
we were married.

33:21.927 --> 33:24.493
Is Miss Barton, Miss Burton,

33:24.495 --> 33:26.887
is she the first one
you had an affair with?

33:26.889 --> 33:28.323
No.

33:28.325 --> 33:29.324
You sleeping
around didn't bother

33:29.326 --> 33:30.020
your wife at all?

33:30.022 --> 33:31.500
No.

33:31.502 --> 33:33.807
Josiah, maybe if you'd
been home last night

33:33.809 --> 33:35.678
instead of out fucking
one of your friends,

33:35.680 --> 33:37.158
maybe we wouldn't
be here right now.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.812
Did you ever consider that?

33:38.814 --> 33:40.248
I know.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.510
How do you think I feel?

33:41.512 --> 33:43.033
You just don't act like a man

33:43.035 --> 33:44.992
who just lost his entire
family, that's all.

33:44.994 --> 33:45.819
Really?

33:45.821 --> 33:47.342
Really.

33:47.344 --> 33:48.213
How's a man who
just lost his family

33:48.215 --> 33:48.345
supposed to act?

33:50.129 --> 33:51.781
Look, we wanna talk with
you some more, Josiah.

33:51.783 --> 33:54.349
Where will you be
the next few days?

33:54.351 --> 33:56.960
I'd probably be staying
at my momma's house.

33:56.962 --> 33:58.484
All right, we understand.

33:58.486 --> 34:00.094
Just leave the number
and the address

34:00.096 --> 34:01.228
with Detective Thompson.

34:02.229 --> 34:03.186
We'll get in touch.

34:04.883 --> 34:07.144
All right, Wisper,
we're heading out back.

34:07.146 --> 34:10.062
Don't want the press to make
mincemeat out of you just yet.

34:31.518 --> 34:32.648
Come on.

34:32.650 --> 34:33.475
Let's get out of here.

34:33.476 --> 34:35.260
Come on, please.

34:35.262 --> 34:36.391
I shot a
little more at the house.

34:36.393 --> 34:37.958
How did it go in there?

34:37.960 --> 34:39.481
They said it was an
informal investigation,

34:39.483 --> 34:40.658
that's cop talk
for intimidation.

34:45.184 --> 34:48.011
Ah, fuck!

34:48.013 --> 34:49.101
Something ain't right.

34:50.842 --> 34:51.668
This was a hit.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.583
I could feel it.

34:54.629 --> 34:55.760
They killed my family.

34:56.935 --> 34:58.285
They wanna make me suffer.

34:59.851 --> 35:01.375
What are
we gonna do, J?

35:02.332 --> 35:03.897
I don't know.

35:03.899 --> 35:05.030
But I know they're
coming for me next.

35:07.337 --> 35:09.468
I'm not gonna let them do it.

35:09.470 --> 35:12.906
From now on, we're
gonna get everything.

35:12.908 --> 35:14.866
Whatever you
say, J, I'm with you.

35:18.609 --> 35:20.263
Okay, we're here.

35:23.832 --> 35:27.444
My whole family, gone.

35:29.838 --> 35:30.926
How could this happen?

35:32.971 --> 35:34.408
It was so hopeless, Mom.

35:35.844 --> 35:38.235
Have one of these,
little brother.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.326
It'll cure anything.

35:41.980 --> 35:42.938
What happened, man?

35:46.202 --> 35:47.421
I don't know.

35:49.553 --> 35:50.424
I got home.

35:52.121 --> 35:53.165
And I found the kids.

35:56.343 --> 35:57.431
And then I found Alisa.

35:59.955 --> 36:01.348
I just can't understand why.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.568
We just have to
pray on it, baby.

36:06.570 --> 36:07.743
I know you must be hungry.

36:07.745 --> 36:09.441
Let me fix you something to eat.

36:09.443 --> 36:10.531
No, not hungry, momma.

36:12.054 --> 36:13.969
I'm good with this one.

36:29.941 --> 36:31.073
They think I did it.

36:34.119 --> 36:35.817
They're not saying it outright

36:37.732 --> 36:39.993
but that's what
they're getting to.

36:39.995 --> 36:41.211
You know how these people are,

36:41.213 --> 36:43.388
specially the white ones.

36:43.390 --> 36:44.389
Curtis.

36:44.391 --> 36:45.738
Well it's true.

36:45.740 --> 36:46.610
I didn't do it.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.134
I didn't do nothing.

36:51.963 --> 36:53.269
I don't even know
what I didn't do.

36:56.490 --> 36:57.532
Too bad
you weren't recording

36:57.534 --> 36:59.142
when it happened.

36:59.144 --> 37:00.143
A nine
year old Metro girl

37:00.145 --> 37:01.318
has a new lease on life

37:01.320 --> 37:02.191
thanks to surgery at the,

37:03.584 --> 37:05.410
There were no signs
of a forced entry

37:05.412 --> 37:07.281
and no evidence of a robbery.

37:07.283 --> 37:10.197
Apparently the assailant
was known by the family.

37:10.199 --> 37:12.721
However, one source
indicated to this reporter

37:12.723 --> 37:15.071
that there are many
questions about Wisper.

37:15.073 --> 37:17.639
His quick rise from
poor ghetto beginnings

37:17.641 --> 37:20.250
to a well-to-do businessman

37:20.252 --> 37:23.819
owning several bars
and a $650,000 home.

37:23.821 --> 37:25.342
I don't believe it.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.214
Our sources also
indicated that Wisper

37:27.216 --> 37:30.260
may be involved in illegal
lobbying, influence peddling

37:30.262 --> 37:32.132
and possibly even
drug trafficking.

37:32.134 --> 37:33.568
That's your answer?

37:33.570 --> 37:35.048
You hear this shit?

37:35.050 --> 37:36.443
Josiah don't
work with the man.

37:37.748 --> 37:39.008
I can't.

37:39.010 --> 37:40.749
You blind motherfuckers, man!

37:40.751 --> 37:41.968
- Josiah.
- Blind ass motherfuckers.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.623
Josiah James Wisper,

37:44.625 --> 37:46.191
get your butt back in here!

37:55.418 --> 37:57.420
Here you are, brother.

37:59.727 --> 38:01.030
That must be Reverend Henning.

38:01.032 --> 38:01.859
Shit.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.860
I know you don't wanna
think about these things

38:04.862 --> 38:07.210
right now son, but
they have to be done.

38:07.212 --> 38:08.039
No.

38:09.693 --> 38:11.911
I don't need some
pious Jesus freak

38:11.913 --> 38:15.349
wanting to save my soul
from everlasting life

38:15.351 --> 38:17.046
of fucking sin or whatever.

38:17.048 --> 38:18.787
I've been known to
do a prayer like that

38:18.789 --> 38:22.184
on a few auspicious
occasions, brother, but,

38:23.533 --> 38:25.794
it isn't why your mother
asked me by today.

38:25.796 --> 38:28.057
Son, this is Reverend Henning.

38:28.059 --> 38:29.232
Apologize, Reverend.

38:29.234 --> 38:30.409
The luminous at my church.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.150
Can I get you something
to drink, Reverend?

38:34.152 --> 38:36.457
Lemonade, iced tea, coffee?

38:36.459 --> 38:37.980
No, no, no, no,
thank you ma'am.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.155
You know what, I'll
just have the same

38:39.157 --> 38:40.158
as these men here.

38:43.248 --> 38:44.075
I'm sorry.

38:45.207 --> 38:46.859
Does that thing have to be on?

38:46.861 --> 38:47.688
Yes.

38:53.041 --> 38:53.868
And,

38:57.567 --> 38:59.436
You must be Josiah.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.310
That's me, Reverend.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.531
This is my big brother Curtis.

39:06.184 --> 39:07.011
Josiah.

39:08.099 --> 39:09.100
I'll get that drink.

39:22.026 --> 39:22.853
Hey.

39:24.289 --> 39:25.856
I'm very sorry
about your family.

39:27.902 --> 39:29.991
Your mother's already
told me quite a bit.

39:31.079 --> 39:34.952
And I understand your feelings.

39:36.432 --> 39:38.390
I don't think anyone
can right now, Reverend.

39:39.522 --> 39:41.740
It's true, you know.

39:41.742 --> 39:43.134
No one ever can, right?

39:44.788 --> 39:45.961
May I call you Josiah?

39:45.963 --> 39:46.834
You already did.

39:47.922 --> 39:49.356
Everybody calls me J.

39:49.358 --> 39:50.185
J.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.187
J, look.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.494
J, I've never found it easy.

39:58.846 --> 40:02.151
I've never found it
easy to help someone

40:02.153 --> 40:03.415
at a time like this.

40:04.678 --> 40:05.940
So I won't pretend.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.378
But some decisions,

40:10.901 --> 40:12.599
some decisions have to be made.

40:14.383 --> 40:16.603
And I'm here to help
you as much as possible.

40:18.213 --> 40:19.693
I appreciate that, Reverend.

40:22.913 --> 40:26.482
I do want my family to
have a proper funeral.

40:27.788 --> 40:30.658
But I don't want
crying and amens

40:30.660 --> 40:34.662
and any other tearjerking crap.

40:34.664 --> 40:39.669
Just something
dignified and quiet

40:40.757 --> 40:42.280
and for momma and our friends.

40:43.847 --> 40:48.852
I hear you.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.855
Thank you, Curtis.

40:54.510 --> 40:59.515
I hear you.

41:00.734 --> 41:02.779
A77, turn here.

41:05.521 --> 41:06.348
You okay, momma?

41:08.655 --> 41:10.744
Curtis, Curtis.

41:11.919 --> 41:12.961
You all right?

41:12.963 --> 41:13.964
I'm fine.

41:16.097 --> 41:16.924
Here it is.

41:23.452 --> 41:24.279
You're okay?

41:25.672 --> 41:26.455
Thanks.

41:27.630 --> 41:28.890
So sorry.

41:28.892 --> 41:29.761
- Thanks.
- God bless you.

41:29.763 --> 41:30.633
Keep it moving.

41:33.549 --> 41:34.940
Deepest sympathy,
I'm very sorry.

41:34.942 --> 41:36.071
Thanks.

41:36.073 --> 41:37.292
I'm so sorry.

41:49.521 --> 41:50.825
You go ahead in line,
there's enough there.

41:50.827 --> 41:51.826
Got it.

41:51.828 --> 41:52.699
Watch yourself, J.

41:56.528 --> 42:00.663
Sunday, June 12th
2016, 3:25 p.m.

42:06.234 --> 42:07.407
Three lives and
you swear them,

42:07.409 --> 42:08.800
that's the kind of relation?

42:08.802 --> 42:09.977
Really, motherfucker?

42:11.282 --> 42:12.717
He didn't say that.

42:12.719 --> 42:14.198
He didn't say that to me.

42:15.765 --> 42:17.722
J's good people.

42:17.724 --> 42:19.421
He's always been good to me.

42:20.509 --> 42:22.727
But like I said, he's the boss.

42:22.729 --> 42:23.860
Do you understand?

42:24.818 --> 42:26.426
Yeah.

42:26.428 --> 42:28.473
So last night he
rolled up in here.

42:29.997 --> 42:32.651
He's beat, started
tasting the bottle.

42:34.088 --> 42:37.308
Said he was going home,
asked me to close up.

42:38.701 --> 42:40.396
I close up on him.

42:40.398 --> 42:41.225
Willy.

42:42.661 --> 42:45.706
We're in New York
City jurisdiction now.

42:45.708 --> 42:47.490
Detective Cardelli
is here courtesy

42:47.492 --> 42:48.972
of my commanding officer.

42:50.452 --> 42:53.496
And my partner, he's
attending the funeral.

42:53.498 --> 42:56.980
So we appreciate
your cooperation

42:58.155 --> 43:00.288
but we both have more questions.

43:02.899 --> 43:03.770
Shoot.

43:05.554 --> 43:07.554
Willy, did
you ever see your boss

43:07.556 --> 43:09.123
with a small gun, like

43:11.778 --> 43:13.040
a pocket pistol?

43:16.130 --> 43:16.913
Let's see.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.525
J had a 38.

43:21.613 --> 43:23.613
Called it his sister.

43:23.615 --> 43:26.486
If he was carrying a
lot of money on him,

43:26.488 --> 43:28.618
he's walking with his sister.

43:28.620 --> 43:30.274
He intended on
keeping his money.

43:32.146 --> 43:34.494
Willy,
have you yourself

43:34.496 --> 43:35.932
been in trouble with the law?

43:38.195 --> 43:39.196
Kids stuff.

43:42.591 --> 43:44.112
Yeah?

43:44.114 --> 43:45.287
Shit kids get
into trouble for.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.811
All kids get into trouble

43:46.813 --> 43:49.030
before they graduate
from high school.

43:49.032 --> 43:49.946
Like?

43:52.383 --> 43:54.340
Stealing a car.

43:54.342 --> 43:57.038
You know, taking something
from the five and dime,

43:57.040 --> 43:58.910
no real shit.

43:58.912 --> 44:00.914
You know, we
can check records.

44:05.483 --> 44:06.745
Do what you need to do.

44:08.182 --> 44:10.053
I got someplace
else I need to be.

44:17.278 --> 44:19.280
Appreciate you
helping me out on this.

44:20.716 --> 44:23.632
Look, I owe you for Bergman.

44:26.722 --> 44:28.243
TV lights are gonna spread out

44:28.245 --> 44:30.117
on both sides of the
river on this one.

44:31.205 --> 44:33.683
It can be a boost for both of us

44:33.685 --> 44:36.471
instead of drowning in
the usual flood of shit.

44:38.386 --> 44:39.648
Just one thing though.

44:41.693 --> 44:44.259
Wisper's still paranoid.

44:44.261 --> 44:45.434
Like there's someone
still out there

44:45.436 --> 44:46.916
trying to finish the job.

44:48.700 --> 44:49.527
Is it real?

44:50.877 --> 44:52.267
Has to be.

44:52.269 --> 44:54.228
This whole neighborhood
is paranoid.

44:56.926 --> 44:58.101
Look, time will tell.

45:00.451 --> 45:01.450
I'll be in touch.

45:01.452 --> 45:03.365
You bet, I hope so.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.717
You could turn
this fucking thing off now.

45:07.154 --> 45:10.677
June 20th, 2016, 10:25 a.m.

45:10.679 --> 45:13.723
Second interview
with Josiah Wisper.

45:13.725 --> 45:15.769
Thanks for coming in again.

45:15.771 --> 45:17.292
Before we begin, I wanna ask you

45:17.294 --> 45:18.293
are you sure you
wanna appear here

45:18.295 --> 45:19.120
without an attorney?

45:19.122 --> 45:20.643
I'm sure.

45:20.645 --> 45:21.644
Can you tell me
more about that night

45:21.646 --> 45:22.297
with Miss Burton?

45:22.299 --> 45:23.820
Sure.

45:23.822 --> 45:25.692
The night you spent
with Miss Burton,

45:25.694 --> 45:26.388
were you in each other's
company the entire night?

45:26.390 --> 45:27.824
Yes.

45:27.826 --> 45:29.174
Sure you didn't leave her side

45:29.176 --> 45:30.697
maybe when she fell asleep?

45:30.699 --> 45:31.526
I'm sure.

45:33.354 --> 45:35.006
Did you stop by your home
on your way to Miss Burton?

45:35.008 --> 45:36.790
No, I told you.

45:36.792 --> 45:38.489
And your wife
knew where you were?

45:40.317 --> 45:42.622
Because of the
nature of my business

45:42.624 --> 45:43.668
and the hours I keep,

45:45.366 --> 45:48.064
sometimes I stay in the
city, sometimes with friends.

45:49.544 --> 45:51.196
And that didn't
concern her at all?

45:51.198 --> 45:52.025
No.

45:53.765 --> 45:54.939
Except when it would
cause me to miss

45:54.941 --> 45:56.246
one of my kids' school events.

46:00.381 --> 46:01.382
Sorry guys.

46:04.124 --> 46:04.951
Paperwork.

46:06.778 --> 46:08.343
We were just discussing
your wife's reaction

46:08.345 --> 46:10.389
to you staying out
of town overnight.

46:10.391 --> 46:12.957
Yeah, you guys argue
about that sort of thing?

46:12.959 --> 46:15.698
You know, about you
staying out all night?

46:15.700 --> 46:17.178
I told you.

46:17.180 --> 46:18.745
For the most part,
Alisa was cool

46:18.747 --> 46:20.573
with that side of my life.

46:20.575 --> 46:23.315
Must have been some
sort of superwoman, right?

46:23.317 --> 46:24.794
To have your wife be okay

46:24.796 --> 46:26.622
with your nighttime
proclivities.

46:26.624 --> 46:28.189
We should bring her in
here and probably ask her.

46:28.191 --> 46:29.801
Oh wait we can't,
'cause she's dead.

46:32.282 --> 46:34.154
Go fuck yourself, Detective.

46:35.851 --> 46:39.374
Look, Josiah, we
appreciate you coming in.

46:39.376 --> 46:41.986
We're just trying
to sort this out,

46:41.988 --> 46:44.118
find the pieces that fit.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.338
Okay some of this may
sound outlandish to you

46:46.340 --> 46:49.123
but I assure you it's necessary.

46:49.125 --> 46:51.647
Okay, New York's doing
their part in Harlem.

46:51.649 --> 46:53.693
We are gonna solve this case.

46:53.695 --> 46:55.001
I hope so.

46:56.089 --> 46:57.349
Oh we will.

46:57.351 --> 46:58.524
We're gonna talk
some more to you

46:58.526 --> 47:00.265
and everyone else involved.

47:00.267 --> 47:02.310
We're gonna turn
this thing inside out

47:02.312 --> 47:05.835
until we learn the truth, okay?

47:05.837 --> 47:08.447
So I hope you've been
truthful with us, Josiah.

47:08.449 --> 47:12.842
And if not, I suggest you
start being straight with me,

47:12.844 --> 47:14.670
do you understand?

47:14.672 --> 47:15.499
I hear you.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.677
I'm standing here
with Debra Casale.

47:21.679 --> 47:25.638
Miss Casale, did you
know the Wispers well?

47:25.640 --> 47:27.553
I really didn't
know them that well.

47:27.555 --> 47:30.860
He was always with that camera
taping his children and such.

47:30.862 --> 47:32.601
He taped me too.

47:32.603 --> 47:35.039
Did you have any
concerns with a bar owner

47:35.041 --> 47:37.258
and potential drug
dealer living next to you

47:37.260 --> 47:38.825
and your family?

47:38.827 --> 47:40.348
- Well.
- Shut it off.

47:40.350 --> 47:42.698
- I was a little concerned.
- Not you.

47:42.700 --> 47:44.222
Brother.

47:44.224 --> 47:46.050
We never imagined he
could be a drug dealer.

47:46.052 --> 47:47.529
I mean this is a
nice neighborhood,

47:47.531 --> 47:49.444
I never thought
they would hurt us.

47:49.446 --> 47:51.881
Can you go up
the city tomorrow?

47:51.883 --> 47:52.882
- You okay?
- Sure, what you got?

47:52.884 --> 47:54.058
Uh huh.

47:54.060 --> 47:55.581
Cops wanna talk to Melonie

47:55.583 --> 47:57.017
and I need you to
be there to get it.

47:57.019 --> 47:58.107
How'd you swing that?

47:59.935 --> 48:01.937
You're not a suspect and
we're hiding the camera.

48:11.425 --> 48:12.424
This is her address.

48:12.426 --> 48:14.295
They'll be there at two.

48:14.297 --> 48:15.472
I'll be there at one.

48:16.995 --> 48:18.125
There's some other
people you wanna get

48:18.127 --> 48:21.087
but we'll get to that later.

48:25.439 --> 48:27.136
Is the gun still
in safekeeping?

48:28.137 --> 48:29.095
I'll be scarce.

48:30.139 --> 48:31.140
Won't be needing it.

48:33.273 --> 48:35.492
All right ,
let's get to it.

48:48.114 --> 48:49.115
Nice couch.

48:52.379 --> 48:54.030
You sure this is gonna help J?

48:54.032 --> 48:55.554
It can't hurt.

48:55.556 --> 48:57.121
He's starting to
relax a little bit

48:57.123 --> 48:58.124
so we should really
try to take advantage.

48:59.255 --> 49:00.428
Don't look at the camera.

49:00.430 --> 49:01.690
Looking at it or even toward it

49:01.692 --> 49:02.998
is gonna attract
attention, okay?

49:03.912 --> 49:04.782
Yeah, okay.

49:08.221 --> 49:10.136
Come in and have a seat.

49:15.228 --> 49:16.966
Can I get you some
coffee, Detective?

49:16.968 --> 49:18.707
Or a drink?

49:18.709 --> 49:20.796
- No thanks.
- I'll take some coffee.

49:20.798 --> 49:22.276
Never mind.

49:22.278 --> 49:23.671
No thank you, Miss Burton.

49:25.194 --> 49:27.065
Presumably it is Miss?

49:27.892 --> 49:28.978
It'll do.

49:28.980 --> 49:29.851
I'm divorced.

49:32.288 --> 49:34.767
Miss Burton,
I would like to ask you

49:34.769 --> 49:36.203
some questions about the night

49:36.205 --> 49:37.511
that you were with Josiah.

49:38.425 --> 49:39.252
Go ahead.

49:40.601 --> 49:42.383
Now Miss Burton,

49:42.385 --> 49:43.950
you and Josiah came here

49:43.952 --> 49:46.822
directly from his
child's birthday party.

49:46.824 --> 49:49.260
Now he didn't happen
to leave this house

49:49.262 --> 49:52.567
to go anywhere for
say, I don't know

49:52.569 --> 49:54.615
a nightcap or a cup of coffee?

49:56.094 --> 49:58.009
Or a stop in Jersey
to kill his family?

50:00.055 --> 50:01.533
I didn't say that.

50:01.535 --> 50:06.277
I know what you meant,
Detective Rothstein.

50:06.279 --> 50:08.192
Sorry, Rothstein.

50:08.194 --> 50:11.717
No, he came straight
here from the party.

50:11.719 --> 50:15.111
He came in, stopped
at the front door,

50:15.113 --> 50:16.461
hung out here in the living room

50:16.463 --> 50:17.766
and then we went straight to bed

50:17.768 --> 50:20.421
and I fucked his brains out.

50:20.423 --> 50:22.077
Is that what you wanted to know?

50:25.341 --> 50:30.083
We had breakfast in the
morning and then he left.

50:30.085 --> 50:31.998
It was about what, nine o'clock.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.522
He had a 10 o'clock meeting
with his accountant.

50:34.524 --> 50:36.176
And neither
of you left here at all

50:36.178 --> 50:39.701
during the night,
together or separately?

50:39.703 --> 50:41.225
No.

50:41.227 --> 50:43.229
How many times do I have
to tell you that, no.

50:46.144 --> 50:48.625
You know, you
give him a very strong alibi.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.019
Do you think he needs one?

50:52.847 --> 50:54.892
No, not in the least.

50:56.416 --> 50:59.286
Gives
you a strong one too.

50:59.288 --> 51:00.158
What?

51:01.595 --> 51:03.769
Makes me
wonder if you need one.

51:03.771 --> 51:04.598
Why?

51:05.686 --> 51:07.209
Is there a law against fucking?

51:15.957 --> 51:17.522
I hope you had a good fourth.

51:17.524 --> 51:19.480
I see you cleaned
the place up a bit.

51:19.482 --> 51:20.440
Been here before?

51:22.268 --> 51:23.832
You know if you feel more
comfortable, we can go...

51:23.834 --> 51:25.312
No come on, let's
get this over with.

51:25.314 --> 51:26.313
All right.

51:26.315 --> 51:27.229
About your sister Alisa,

51:28.274 --> 51:30.143
what's your relationship?

51:30.145 --> 51:33.320
I mean we wasn't exactly
alike, as you can see.

51:33.322 --> 51:35.366
She's the more successful one,

51:35.368 --> 51:37.326
always driven to
rise above it all.

51:38.284 --> 51:39.546
And she did too.

51:40.634 --> 51:42.723
And look where it got her.

51:43.985 --> 51:47.945
So you and Alisa, very close?

51:49.686 --> 51:51.599
I mean we was close
enough as sisters could be

51:51.601 --> 51:53.081
but we did our own thing too.

51:54.691 --> 51:56.563
When was the last
time you saw her?

51:58.086 --> 52:00.393
When he brought that
video ho to the house.

52:03.004 --> 52:05.309
So no time between in,

52:05.311 --> 52:06.181
Look.

52:07.661 --> 52:08.660
I got a life too,
I can't be worried

52:08.662 --> 52:09.184
about everybody else!

52:10.664 --> 52:12.666
One of the neighbors
spotted you June 5th.

52:13.580 --> 52:14.407
God.

52:16.104 --> 52:18.191
Lord they nobody but
their damn nosy ass

52:18.193 --> 52:19.977
Italian bitch Mrs. Casale.

52:22.153 --> 52:23.546
Yeah I was there.

52:24.547 --> 52:26.027
I needed to see Alisa.

52:29.204 --> 52:30.901
I went over there
that morning but

52:32.294 --> 52:33.339
nobody was home.

52:34.992 --> 52:36.342
Well what about?

52:37.386 --> 52:39.647
Damn, you all in my business.

52:39.649 --> 52:41.910
I needed to borrow some money.

52:41.912 --> 52:45.436
So did you borrow money
from the Wispers very often?

52:45.438 --> 52:48.397
Not the Wispers, Alisa.

52:51.226 --> 52:52.356
She always looked out for me

52:52.358 --> 52:53.968
and slid me a little something.

52:55.535 --> 52:57.448
But Wisper?

52:57.450 --> 53:00.757
He don't give a damn about
nobody but his damn self.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.846
So you don't get
along with Josiah?

53:04.848 --> 53:07.980
Look, junior Detective.

53:07.982 --> 53:09.418
I can get along with anybody.

53:11.202 --> 53:12.116
But Wisper?

53:13.466 --> 53:14.639
He always looking down on me

53:14.641 --> 53:15.990
like I'm trash or something.

53:17.426 --> 53:19.470
When he this close to
being trash himself.

53:19.472 --> 53:21.428
Like what kind of grown ass man

53:21.430 --> 53:24.126
walks around with a camera
following him all the time

53:24.128 --> 53:25.826
like he about to be on
the news or something?

53:26.914 --> 53:28.437
He's reckless.

53:29.786 --> 53:32.136
And I bet you he
filmed his affairs too.

53:36.140 --> 53:36.967
But Alisa?

53:39.361 --> 53:40.797
Alisa got a heart.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.542
She always looked out for
me and for her friends.

53:48.022 --> 53:48.936
Man, we done here?

53:51.417 --> 53:52.243
Yeah.

53:54.158 --> 53:56.422
Don't call me
back down here no more.

54:04.952 --> 54:06.038
You ready, Kenny?

54:06.040 --> 54:06.867
Yup.

54:08.825 --> 54:13.395
Tuesday July 12th,
2016, 2:35 p.m.

54:16.659 --> 54:19.355
Clara, Josiah asked me to
canvas the neighborhood

54:19.357 --> 54:22.097
to just document some
thoughts and comments,

54:22.099 --> 54:24.275
anything you feel like
sharing, you know.

54:25.233 --> 54:26.060
Anything.

54:27.496 --> 54:28.669
I remember the
detectives told me

54:28.671 --> 54:30.149
I shouldn't talk to anyone.

54:30.151 --> 54:31.500
He meant the news people.

54:32.545 --> 54:33.633
He did mention them.

54:36.244 --> 54:37.898
The last time you saw Alisa?

54:42.468 --> 54:45.033
It was two days
before it happened.

54:45.035 --> 54:47.253
How was she, like
her normal self?

54:47.255 --> 54:48.254
No she wasn't.

54:48.256 --> 54:49.777
She was very upset.

54:49.779 --> 54:51.910
Her husband being
in the city so much,

54:51.912 --> 54:53.955
that upset her a lot.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.483
But on that day,
she was much worse.

54:58.440 --> 54:59.267
How?

55:06.796 --> 55:10.668
She used to say that
these things bother her.

55:10.670 --> 55:11.932
She mean her husband?

55:13.324 --> 55:14.891
We used to meet up and talk.

55:18.155 --> 55:19.461
On that particular day,

55:21.985 --> 55:23.639
I just don't know
how to say this.

55:25.380 --> 55:27.382
Take your time
Clara, it's okay.

55:29.558 --> 55:31.732
I remember telling
her that she has to

55:31.734 --> 55:33.647
go with the flow and
not to let things

55:33.649 --> 55:35.257
bother her so much.

55:35.259 --> 55:37.523
And then she said
there were times.

55:39.873 --> 55:41.091
Times when?

55:42.571 --> 55:46.921
How she
wondered how it would be

55:46.923 --> 55:48.619
if her husband
would come back home

55:48.621 --> 55:50.013
to a empty house.

55:52.712 --> 55:53.539
I gotta go.

56:02.199 --> 56:04.635
If her husband would come
back home to an empty house.

56:04.637 --> 56:06.680
Yeah, she'd threatened
to take the kids

56:06.682 --> 56:07.553
away from me.

56:09.206 --> 56:11.295
Run off to her
mom's and Norma's.

56:13.123 --> 56:14.647
There's nowhere she can go
that I wouldn't find them.

56:16.649 --> 56:18.389
It was Alisa just mouthing off.

56:19.260 --> 56:20.087
Follow me.

56:29.487 --> 56:31.313
You sure you won't reconsider?

56:31.315 --> 56:33.838
I'll make some things
happen and Oasis is yours.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.059
Thanks J, but it's
better this way.

56:40.368 --> 56:42.065
They're gonna
find out the truth

56:43.153 --> 56:45.199
and this will all be over.

56:46.679 --> 56:48.594
But people will
always be people.

56:51.509 --> 56:53.988
Do you want me to say this, hmm?

56:53.990 --> 56:56.425
They will always remember
that I was your alibi

56:56.427 --> 56:59.298
and the Oasis,
that was my reward.

56:59.300 --> 57:00.908
No, I'm sorry.

57:00.910 --> 57:02.083
That's not the truth.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.607
Yeah, whatever.

57:03.609 --> 57:04.566
Whatever?

57:05.654 --> 57:06.655
Nothing.

57:10.137 --> 57:11.617
It's that night, isn't it?

57:14.489 --> 57:17.623
You were gone for a long time!

57:18.624 --> 57:20.362
Baby, I told you,

57:20.364 --> 57:21.799
it's something I ate
was tearing up my guts.

57:21.801 --> 57:23.322
I had to find a drugstore.

57:23.324 --> 57:26.064
But I lied about it, okay?

57:26.066 --> 57:27.500
What if they find out?

57:27.502 --> 57:30.416
They will not find out!

57:30.418 --> 57:32.810
I was looking for
a damn drugstore!

57:32.812 --> 57:35.726
Look, I know where I was.

57:35.728 --> 57:36.642
Where were you?

57:44.911 --> 57:46.519
You're staying
around, aren't you?

57:46.521 --> 57:47.914
I'm going to my
sister's upstate.

57:49.350 --> 57:50.915
But,

57:50.917 --> 57:53.136
No, it's got to be
this way, all right?

57:54.398 --> 57:56.313
Look, we had some good times.

57:57.532 --> 57:58.489
But it's over now.

57:59.708 --> 58:01.623
You let me down, J.

58:03.016 --> 58:04.711
I'll miss you.

58:04.713 --> 58:07.235
No
you won't, please.

58:07.237 --> 58:08.978
You don't miss anybody.

58:11.807 --> 58:12.893
Shut it off.

58:12.895 --> 58:13.983
Shut it off!

58:16.682 --> 58:17.811
There he is.

58:17.813 --> 58:21.251
July 20th 2016, 8:43 or so.

58:24.341 --> 58:25.778
Hey It's early.

58:29.346 --> 58:30.739
Still shooting, I see, yeah.

58:32.306 --> 58:33.305
Where's your pretty camera girl?

58:33.307 --> 58:34.088
Just me, Reverend.

58:34.090 --> 58:35.263
Yeah?

58:35.265 --> 58:36.484
Not fond of the gym?

58:37.877 --> 58:40.094
Oh, I like the fresh air.

58:40.096 --> 58:41.879
You should get up
participate once in a while.

58:41.881 --> 58:44.446
I think I'm participating
enough right now, thanks.

58:44.448 --> 58:46.797
Well look, thanks
for meeting me.

58:46.799 --> 58:48.450
So tell me, how's it been going?

58:48.452 --> 58:49.887
Good, good.

58:49.889 --> 58:51.149
Son of a bitch is
finally letting me take

58:51.151 --> 58:52.411
a lie detector test.

58:52.413 --> 58:53.717
Yeah, and?

58:53.719 --> 58:54.589
All good.

58:55.503 --> 58:57.633
J, J, that's great.

58:57.635 --> 59:00.900
Now I just need to
get them to believe me.

59:02.815 --> 59:03.988
There might be a way.

59:03.990 --> 59:06.207
All right, I've got an idea.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.036
Maybe a way.

59:08.298 --> 59:10.124
Yeah, sure.

59:10.126 --> 59:12.474
You find the tall building,
I climb to the top of it

59:12.476 --> 59:13.649
and scream at the
top of my lungs,

59:13.651 --> 59:15.349
"I didn't fucking do it!"

59:16.785 --> 59:18.959
Ah yeah, something like that.

59:18.961 --> 59:19.788
But look.

59:21.224 --> 59:22.746
I'm gonna be honest with you,

59:22.748 --> 59:24.662
there aren't many
miracles left anymore.

59:25.751 --> 59:27.056
But I might have found one.

59:28.449 --> 59:30.016
A friend of mine
runs a radio station.

59:31.626 --> 59:33.669
You could bring that camera.

59:33.671 --> 59:34.498
Sound good?

59:35.586 --> 59:36.760
Reverend, at this point,

59:36.762 --> 59:37.588
I'm willing to try anything.

59:38.938 --> 59:40.285
Bless you, brother,
have a good day.

59:40.287 --> 59:41.373
- Thanks.
- Okay.

59:41.375 --> 59:42.550
You too.

59:50.688 --> 59:52.210
Hey, J, my brother.

59:52.212 --> 59:53.559
Hey, Reverend Henning.

59:53.561 --> 59:54.995
Thanks for coming.

59:54.997 --> 59:56.214
Thanks for setting
this up, man.

59:56.216 --> 59:57.737
- Absolutely.
- Appreciate it.

59:57.739 --> 59:59.217
Hi, I'm Caroline,
the production manager.

59:59.219 --> 01:00:00.174
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

01:00:00.176 --> 01:00:01.872
Josiah Wisper.

01:00:01.874 --> 01:00:02.742
- Nice to meet you.
- Reverend Henning, pleasure.

01:00:02.744 --> 01:00:03.569
Pleasure.

01:00:03.571 --> 01:00:04.744
Right this way.

01:00:04.746 --> 01:00:05.745
Thanks for having me here.

01:00:05.747 --> 01:00:06.966
Welcome.

01:00:08.794 --> 01:00:10.402
So Caroline, how
long you been working here?

01:00:10.404 --> 01:00:11.490
About six months.

01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:12.796
Oh nice.

01:00:12.798 --> 01:00:15.104
Yeah.

01:00:16.758 --> 01:00:18.627
Laura, she's my camera person.

01:00:18.629 --> 01:00:20.151
She's kinda
documenting everything.

01:00:20.153 --> 01:00:21.326
Do you mind if she
comes here with us?

01:00:21.328 --> 01:00:22.806
It's best she doesn't come in.

01:00:22.808 --> 01:00:24.198
Sure, do you
mind if I have her

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.547
just stay outside right here?

01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:27.071
- Sure that's fine.
- Okay.

01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:28.986
All right just set
up right there,

01:00:28.988 --> 01:00:30.335
make sure you stay on
me, get all this, okay?

01:00:30.337 --> 01:00:31.164
Okay.

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:33.773
All right, in here?

01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:36.123
Yeah,
right in here.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:37.690
Hi, Timolyn.

01:00:37.692 --> 01:00:39.039
Pleasure, Josiah Wisper.

01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:40.040
- Thanks for having me.
- Pleasure.

01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:41.563
Nice to meet you.

01:00:41.565 --> 01:00:42.738
Thanks for having
me on your show.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.565
Sure, just sit right here.

01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:44.740
Right here?

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:45.959
Reverend Henning, pleasure.

01:00:45.961 --> 01:00:47.569
Nice
to meet you too.

01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:48.570
I've never been in
one of these before.

01:00:48.572 --> 01:00:49.833
I'm a little nervous.

01:00:49.835 --> 01:00:51.532
It's not so bad.

01:01:06.025 --> 01:01:08.199
Good morning and
welcome to Urban Report.

01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:10.331
I am Timolyn Moore
and I'll be your host

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.595
for the next hour.

01:01:13.728 --> 01:01:16.207
This morning we have a very
distinguished guest with us,

01:01:16.209 --> 01:01:17.210
Mr. Josiah Wisper.

01:01:18.211 --> 01:01:20.039
May I call you Josiah?

01:01:23.433 --> 01:01:26.173
Josiah, you will recall
is a very successful

01:01:26.175 --> 01:01:29.002
Harlem tavern owner who
returned home recently

01:01:29.004 --> 01:01:32.876
to find his wife and
children brutally murdered,

01:01:32.878 --> 01:01:36.751
all shot dead by a
mysterious unknown assailant.

01:01:37.665 --> 01:01:41.145
First, Josiah, welcome.

01:01:41.147 --> 01:01:43.016
Thanks.

01:01:43.018 --> 01:01:44.278
Thank you very much for
joining us on our show.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.280
Thank you for having me.

01:01:46.282 --> 01:01:48.804
Josiah, I'd like to start
out by asking a question

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.591
that's on everyone's mind.

01:01:52.898 --> 01:01:55.204
Did you murder your family?

01:02:00.731 --> 01:02:01.905
J, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:02:01.907 --> 01:02:02.124
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:05.258 --> 01:02:06.822
Look, I'm really
sorry about that.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.129
I wasn't expecting her
to say that, I'm sorry.

01:02:09.131 --> 01:02:11.697
Sorry, she's
not her sensitive self today.

01:02:11.699 --> 01:02:13.742
Yeah, but I'm used to it now.

01:02:13.744 --> 01:02:15.701
Look, it's not your
fault, I'll call you.

01:02:15.703 --> 01:02:16.920
Come on, let's just
get out of here.

01:02:16.922 --> 01:02:18.488
It's a waste of my fucking time.

01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:27.843
We're
trying very hard.

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:28.977
You ain't helping much.

01:02:30.065 --> 01:02:32.502
I've put up a $5,000 reward.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.633
I know.

01:02:34.635 --> 01:02:36.028
But everything's a dead end.

01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:39.420
Look, we know you
passed the polygraph

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.814
but we still can't prove
where you was at that night.

01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:44.208
Now it's too bad you
weren't recording yourself.

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:47.907
I've told
you a dozen times.

01:02:47.909 --> 01:02:49.953
And the lady backed you up.

01:02:49.955 --> 01:02:51.867
What's the problem?

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.391
You're
backing each other up.

01:02:53.393 --> 01:02:55.306
It's not like you
have a witness.

01:02:55.308 --> 01:02:56.787
We weren't into threesomes.

01:02:57.963 --> 01:02:59.919
Let's talk about drugs.

01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:02.748
Harlem's busted a lot
of drugs in your bar.

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.577
That's a major dent
in illicit revenue.

01:03:05.579 --> 01:03:07.144
I hope so.

01:03:07.146 --> 01:03:09.842
I busted my ass tipping
off the authorities too.

01:03:09.844 --> 01:03:12.105
Whoah, whoah, whoah,
wait, wait, wait.

01:03:12.107 --> 01:03:14.586
You helped the department
on those arrests?

01:03:14.588 --> 01:03:15.676
They never told you?

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:21.158
What have we got here, two
separate investigations?

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.724
Y'all don't talk to each other?

01:03:22.726 --> 01:03:23.899
What happens, whoever
solves the Wisper murder

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.684
gets a big fucking medal?

01:03:25.686 --> 01:03:27.207
All right, all right,

01:03:27.209 --> 01:03:29.514
it's just something we
weren't informed of.

01:03:29.516 --> 01:03:31.733
Christ, I could run
this investigation

01:03:31.735 --> 01:03:34.649
better than both of
your departments.

01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:36.869
Don't even think
about meddling.

01:03:36.871 --> 01:03:39.350
Thank you, but any
information I find out

01:03:39.352 --> 01:03:40.873
in regards to my
family's murder,

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:42.483
I don't consider meddling.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:43.745
Just don't interfere.

01:03:43.747 --> 01:03:44.748
Interfere?

01:03:46.185 --> 01:03:47.880
As long as we've got
two police departments

01:03:47.882 --> 01:03:49.664
acting like two
separate countries,

01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:51.579
why shouldn't I interfere?

01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:53.799
That reward is the
only constructive thing

01:03:53.801 --> 01:03:55.540
going on in this case.

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:57.368
You get your shit together

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.370
or by damn I will interfere.

01:03:59.372 --> 01:04:00.762
I want these murders solved,

01:04:00.764 --> 01:04:02.027
I want them solved!

01:04:03.637 --> 01:04:04.594
So do we, Josiah.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.507
So do we!

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.293
Then do it.

01:04:24.136 --> 01:04:25.744
Let's see what they
have this time.

01:04:25.746 --> 01:04:27.180
All right, come on.

01:04:27.182 --> 01:04:28.181
You
know where Josiah is?

01:04:28.183 --> 01:04:28.879
In the back.

01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:32.316
Bravo gentlemen, you
finally talk to each other.

01:04:32.318 --> 01:04:34.231
Come on in.

01:04:34.233 --> 01:04:36.537
That drug thing
was a communication problem.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.364
We apologize.

01:04:37.366 --> 01:04:38.365
Right.

01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:39.366
Can we sit?

01:04:39.368 --> 01:04:41.151
Please, by all means.

01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:42.674
As you see we're not
exactly at full capacity.

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:54.990
I got your message, how'd it go?

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:56.079
How did what go?

01:04:56.081 --> 01:04:58.083
The setup, the sting.

01:04:59.519 --> 01:05:03.260
Oh yeah it was a week
ago, last Wednesday.

01:05:03.262 --> 01:05:05.697
Yeah, we heard it
was Number Uno,

01:05:05.699 --> 01:05:07.655
or one of his dealers
that did your family

01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:09.831
for the problems
you caused them.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:11.398
Yeah, I know that.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400
Yeah we did it
at Sweet's Tavern.

01:05:13.402 --> 01:05:15.794
Yeah we did it at Sweet's
Tavern near Broadway, okay?

01:05:15.796 --> 01:05:17.535
We had to catch
him in something so

01:05:17.537 --> 01:05:20.103
we knew he wasn't at
the New York Place.

01:05:20.105 --> 01:05:22.105
So why didn't you
just bring him in?

01:05:22.107 --> 01:05:24.324
He had to do something first.

01:05:24.326 --> 01:05:27.721
Look, Josiah, we're here
as a courtesy, you know that?

01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:31.288
So the word on the
street was that he did it

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.901
or he ordered it and
knew the guy who did it.

01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:38.556
So we set him up with a
informant who was wired.

01:05:38.558 --> 01:05:39.774
He was to walk in and you
know, start a conversation,

01:05:39.776 --> 01:05:41.559
get him to talk

01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:43.780
and hopefully he'll
implicate himself on tape.

01:05:45.086 --> 01:05:48.220
We paid this
informant $6,000 cash.

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:52.049
So what's your point?

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.834
He walked in the
front door of the bar

01:05:55.836 --> 01:05:57.488
and walked out the back
door, ripped off the wire

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.317
and ran away.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.147
You know this guy who
did, the snitch, right?

01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:04.625
He's gone Josiah, he's gone.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.192
We don't know where he is.

01:06:06.194 --> 01:06:07.108
Uno's gone too.

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:10.892
What are you thinking?

01:06:10.894 --> 01:06:14.200
I'm thinking if
somebody gave you guys

01:06:14.202 --> 01:06:17.377
a bag of five dollar bills
to hand out on the corner,

01:06:17.379 --> 01:06:19.164
you'd find a way to fuck it up.

01:06:22.384 --> 01:06:23.383
Glad you're all so intent.

01:06:23.385 --> 01:06:24.602
I want my gun back.

01:06:24.604 --> 01:06:25.951
Your what?

01:06:25.953 --> 01:06:26.952
My gun.

01:06:26.954 --> 01:06:28.432
I want my gun back.

01:06:28.434 --> 01:06:30.260
I'm no longer a
suspect, as you said

01:06:30.262 --> 01:06:32.436
and you've had more than
enough time to check it out.

01:06:32.438 --> 01:06:34.307
I know, I know you're
right, it's clean.

01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:35.917
Cardelli.

01:06:35.919 --> 01:06:37.310
That is my gun.

01:06:37.312 --> 01:06:39.401
I'm legally licensed
to carry it.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.663
I use it for my protection

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.926
from whoever did
this to my family,

01:06:44.928 --> 01:06:47.494
from Uno, even from you.

01:06:47.496 --> 01:06:49.409
Hah, from us?

01:06:49.411 --> 01:06:51.194
Hah, really?

01:06:51.196 --> 01:06:52.022
Really.

01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:53.850
Rothstein.

01:06:55.243 --> 01:06:56.764
Why do you think my
people are still around

01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:58.201
after the haters
been trying to get us

01:06:58.203 --> 01:07:00.203
for hundreds of years?

01:07:00.205 --> 01:07:01.421
'Cause we're forgiving?

01:07:01.423 --> 01:07:02.250
No.

01:07:03.338 --> 01:07:05.295
It's because we're packing.

01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:07.688
Maybe there'd be a lot more
of your people, Rothstein

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.734
if the Jews in Germany

01:07:09.736 --> 01:07:11.736
had acted a little
bit less like Jews

01:07:11.738 --> 01:07:13.566
and a little bit
more like Israelis.

01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:17.872
I want my gun back.

01:07:17.874 --> 01:07:19.918
- I want it back!
- How dare you.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.791
Get the fuck out of
my bar, you're done.

01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:24.229
These gentlemen are
done here, Willy.

01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:32.411
September
12th 2016, 4:26 p.m.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.072
Lil Bro, you sure know
how to find fucking trouble.

01:07:44.074 --> 01:07:45.380
Ain't like I look for it.

01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:48.253
So where were you for
the past two days?

01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:51.950
You boys want some coffee?

01:07:51.952 --> 01:07:54.692
Don't take but a minute
to fix a fresh pot.

01:07:54.694 --> 01:07:55.693
No.

01:07:55.695 --> 01:07:56.520
No thanks, momma.

01:07:56.522 --> 01:07:57.477
You sure?

01:07:57.479 --> 01:07:59.044
Nah, I'm okay.

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:00.526
If you change your
mind, I'm right here.

01:08:01.788 --> 01:08:02.615
Okay.

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.487
Does she have
to fuckin be here?

01:08:07.489 --> 01:08:09.707
She's getting everything I do.

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.839
You didn't answer my question.

01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:12.666
Everything?

01:08:12.668 --> 01:08:13.841
That's bullshit.

01:08:13.843 --> 01:08:15.802
The bullshit's why she's here.

01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:19.849
What do you mean by that, huh?

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:22.939
She's setting
the record straight.

01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:25.853
If you kept
everything straight,

01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:28.116
you wouldn't need
no camera taking it.

01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:31.337
Curtis, why you always
busting my ass about something?

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:33.470
Why you pissed off, huh?

01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.645
What is it that piss you?

01:08:34.647 --> 01:08:36.429
Is it because I'm successful?

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:38.301
That I got a beautiful
home in Jersey

01:08:38.303 --> 01:08:40.651
or I got a little
piece on the side?

01:08:40.653 --> 01:08:43.569
Where were you for
the last two days?

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.527
I'll tell you.

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:48.529
When you turn off the
camera, I'll tell you.

01:08:50.314 --> 01:08:52.314
Okay, I went upstate.

01:08:52.317 --> 01:08:53.578
I had to get away.

01:08:54.884 --> 01:08:56.841
Stop looking at me like that.

01:08:56.843 --> 01:08:59.060
For Christ's sakes, Josiah.

01:08:59.062 --> 01:09:01.497
You had a good wife and family.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.978
Why'd you step on them
like that all the time?

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.457
That's
really fucking up.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:06.850
Fucking up huh?

01:09:06.853 --> 01:09:07.852
Fucking up?

01:09:07.854 --> 01:09:09.375
At least I had a family

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:11.334
and I took damn
good care of 'em.

01:09:11.336 --> 01:09:12.944
How many you ran through, what,

01:09:12.946 --> 01:09:15.337
you been with one,
two, three wives?

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.904
With your holy shit on Sunday

01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:17.948
and your face in
a barrel of scotch

01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:19.515
the rest of the week?

01:09:19.518 --> 01:09:21.734
I know Cardelli
wanted to speak to you

01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:23.694
and you wanted to speak to him.

01:09:23.696 --> 01:09:25.870
So where the fuck did you go?

01:09:25.872 --> 01:09:27.741
What the difference
between me and you,

01:09:27.743 --> 01:09:30.483
is when you stepped out,
you got your wife killed,

01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:32.920
my two nieces, my nephew.

01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:35.053
Bravo, bravo,

01:09:35.055 --> 01:09:36.446
- big brother.
- No.

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:37.621
- You fuckup.
- Would you stop that

01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:38.448
racket right now, hear me?

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.318
Right now!

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.015
Momma.

01:09:40.974 --> 01:09:42.974
It's already made.

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:44.238
Might as well have some.

01:09:47.372 --> 01:09:48.198
Lordy!

01:09:50.723 --> 01:09:53.551
I tried to bring
up two good boys.

01:09:54.509 --> 01:09:56.291
Lord knows I did.

01:09:56.293 --> 01:09:58.642
And look at both of you.

01:09:58.644 --> 01:09:59.862
You never grew up
to be good men.

01:10:01.037 --> 01:10:02.820
You Curtis, drinking your way

01:10:02.822 --> 01:10:04.648
through two good women!

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:07.215
And you Josiah,
shaming your family

01:10:07.217 --> 01:10:10.654
the way you done, what is
wrong with the two of you?!

01:10:10.656 --> 01:10:12.569
I just buried my grandbabies

01:10:12.571 --> 01:10:16.399
and the two of you are
bickering like five year olds!

01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:17.837
It's time to grow up!

01:10:19.012 --> 01:10:20.446
Enough, enough, enough.

01:10:20.448 --> 01:10:22.145
All right.

01:10:30.589 --> 01:10:34.419
September 16, 2016, seven p.m.

01:10:35.724 --> 01:10:37.030
Melonie's sister's house.

01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:38.943
Stay hidden.

01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:39.772
Sure.

01:10:52.393 --> 01:10:53.958
What?

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.438
What?

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.398
Why, J, what are you doing here?

01:10:59.095 --> 01:11:00.270
I was wondering
how you was doing.

01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:04.447
Guess I'm doing okay.

01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:06.144
Really nice out here.

01:11:06.146 --> 01:11:09.452
Look, I was doing
something, all right?

01:11:09.454 --> 01:11:11.454
Please, it's cold out here.

01:11:11.456 --> 01:11:13.458
We're not done.

01:11:14.589 --> 01:11:16.678
J, what do you want?

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.204
That night,
when I went out

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:24.556
to the drugstore, remember?

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.818
Yeah.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.734
When I got back,
you were gone.

01:11:30.431 --> 01:11:31.258
Where'd you go?

01:11:32.346 --> 01:11:34.868
Out to do some killing, hmm?

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:35.869
Don't look around.

01:11:35.871 --> 01:11:37.305
Ain't nobody to help.

01:11:37.307 --> 01:11:39.307
That what you did?

01:11:39.309 --> 01:11:41.266
No, no, I didn't
do nothing like that.

01:11:41.268 --> 01:11:42.748
Look I didn't go do no killing.

01:11:46.752 --> 01:11:48.447
Okay.

01:11:48.449 --> 01:11:49.276
And?

01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:52.407
I had the same thing
happen as you did.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:53.931
And you were gone.

01:11:53.933 --> 01:11:55.106
I had to go out
and get something

01:11:55.108 --> 01:11:56.281
and I was almost out of gas.

01:11:56.283 --> 01:11:57.371
That's why it took so long.

01:11:59.504 --> 01:12:00.633
Then why
didn't you say so?

01:12:00.635 --> 01:12:02.417
'Cause I was your alibi.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:03.899
And if I wasn't there, well,

01:12:05.074 --> 01:12:06.467
then I couldn't tell anyone.

01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:08.948
But they had you already.

01:12:12.386 --> 01:12:14.823
J, what happened to the
girl at the drugstore?

01:12:15.737 --> 01:12:17.345
She could vouch for you.

01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:18.782
I told you,
when I went back,

01:12:18.784 --> 01:12:19.828
they said she
quit, she was gone!

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.527
Look.

01:12:23.876 --> 01:12:25.094
As soon as I solve this,

01:12:26.356 --> 01:12:27.793
I will make it up to you.

01:12:30.926 --> 01:12:33.363
I'm sorry I got you involved.

01:12:38.934 --> 01:12:39.761
Goodbye.

01:12:53.601 --> 01:12:57.429
September
21st, 2016, 5:33 p.m.

01:12:57.431 --> 01:12:58.867
You're pretty good at that.

01:12:59.955 --> 01:13:01.522
I'm good at a lot of things.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:07.134
Hustling pool got
me through college.

01:13:07.136 --> 01:13:09.528
Took a lot of balls
to get my Master's

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.358
before I was able
to get on my feet.

01:13:12.707 --> 01:13:14.272
Want a beer?

01:13:14.274 --> 01:13:15.101
I'm on duty.

01:13:16.581 --> 01:13:18.842
Not in this
state you're not.

01:13:18.844 --> 01:13:19.845
I'm still on duty.

01:13:21.281 --> 01:13:24.587
So all this started
out as a hobby?

01:13:24.589 --> 01:13:25.459
Pretty much.

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:27.592
Until I could quit.

01:13:29.245 --> 01:13:30.464
So what brings you back?

01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:38.209
Rusty.

01:13:38.211 --> 01:13:39.732
Haven't heard you
made any arrests yet.

01:13:39.734 --> 01:13:41.255
Nope.

01:13:41.257 --> 01:13:42.605
You need some pretty
solid evidence for that.

01:13:42.607 --> 01:13:44.130
And we don't have it.

01:13:46.001 --> 01:13:47.916
So Uno gets off?

01:13:49.701 --> 01:13:52.571
Maybe I should take
care of him myself.

01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:53.748
Don't even go there, J.

01:13:55.489 --> 01:13:56.882
So what do you have?

01:13:58.448 --> 01:13:59.970
A theory.

01:13:59.972 --> 01:14:00.799
Theory?

01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:03.887
A theory won't buy you crap.

01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:05.758
Oh it's a believable one.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.979
We just can't prove it.

01:14:08.067 --> 01:14:10.110
For Christ's sakes Cardelli,

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.634
all this time and all you got

01:14:11.636 --> 01:14:13.766
is a theory that you
can't even prove?

01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:18.686
J, the bullets were
from a 32 caliber pistol.

01:14:19.731 --> 01:14:21.644
Yeah it's a light round.

01:14:21.646 --> 01:14:24.864
But a well placed shot
can put a grown man out.

01:14:24.866 --> 01:14:27.345
Now we figured the
shooting took place

01:14:27.347 --> 01:14:29.216
in the dead of night,

01:14:29.218 --> 01:14:31.784
walls cut out most of the sound,

01:14:31.786 --> 01:14:33.658
neighbors slept through
the whole thing.

01:14:34.746 --> 01:14:36.704
Now ballistics match our hunch.

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:40.793
Now there was no one outside
your house that night,

01:14:40.795 --> 01:14:42.360
no activity whatsoever.

01:14:42.362 --> 01:14:44.275
No people, no cars.

01:14:44.277 --> 01:14:46.669
And we interviewed a
bunch of your neighbors

01:14:46.671 --> 01:14:48.192
and we were really
surprised at the amount

01:14:48.194 --> 01:14:49.976
of information we got.

01:14:49.978 --> 01:14:52.805
Not surprising, the
neighbors always poking around.

01:14:52.807 --> 01:14:57.549
Well, with all that and
the crime scene evidence,

01:14:57.551 --> 01:15:00.726
what happened that
night originated

01:15:00.728 --> 01:15:03.905
and was contained
inside that house.

01:15:07.082 --> 01:15:07.909
How?

01:15:10.216 --> 01:15:11.737
It was an inside job, Wisper.

01:15:11.739 --> 01:15:12.607
So now you're back to me.

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:13.434
I told you...

01:15:13.436 --> 01:15:14.437
Not you.

01:15:17.919 --> 01:15:19.745
No, Alisa?

01:15:19.747 --> 01:15:22.054
And then turned the gun
on herself at the end.

01:15:23.838 --> 01:15:26.145
Powder residue on her right
hand backs up that theory.

01:15:27.799 --> 01:15:30.234
No, Alisa, she
didn't own no gun.

01:15:30.236 --> 01:15:32.410
Yeah you know, it's a felony

01:15:32.412 --> 01:15:34.586
to own an unlicensed
firearm in New Jersey,

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:36.590
but come on, if she
wanted to get one.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:40.594
There was no gun at the sink.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.551
And that's where
it all falls apart.

01:15:43.553 --> 01:15:45.294
No gun, no case.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.387
But how?

01:15:52.606 --> 01:15:53.433
They had a key.

01:15:54.869 --> 01:15:56.784
No, no, no, nobody had a key.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.613
Except Norma.

01:16:01.615 --> 01:16:02.745
Nope.

01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:04.311
We can't prove that either.

01:16:04.313 --> 01:16:05.486
Some church ladies
vouched for her.

01:16:05.488 --> 01:16:07.053
They said that she was with them

01:16:07.055 --> 01:16:08.970
overnight at some
kind of gathering.

01:16:10.885 --> 01:16:12.017
It's hard to believe.

01:16:13.453 --> 01:16:15.409
Yeah, it's the
only one that fits.

01:16:15.411 --> 01:16:16.499
And one other thing.

01:16:18.501 --> 01:16:21.678
You are no longer a person
of interest, officially.

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.419
So now you believe
what I told you

01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:27.030
in the first place.

01:16:27.032 --> 01:16:28.250
Unfortunately, yes.

01:16:30.426 --> 01:16:31.253
Unfortunately?

01:16:33.516 --> 01:16:36.039
You know, I just
wish we could have had

01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:37.823
a camera set up that night

01:16:37.825 --> 01:16:39.218
the way you got your camera.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.177
Case closed.

01:16:44.353 --> 01:16:45.702
But that's just a fantasy.

01:16:48.444 --> 01:16:49.966
What?

01:16:49.968 --> 01:16:51.358
I will be in touch
with you shortly.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.231
Let's go, come on.

01:16:55.364 --> 01:16:56.799
Ready J.

01:16:56.801 --> 01:16:57.756
All right,
let's see what we got.

01:17:04.547 --> 01:17:05.374
Okay.

01:17:10.771 --> 01:17:12.425
What do we got here?

01:17:14.166 --> 01:17:16.429
All right, what do you see?

01:17:19.998 --> 01:17:20.825
What?

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.740
Oh god.

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.352
What, what?

01:17:27.788 --> 01:17:30.397
No.

01:17:30.399 --> 01:17:31.226
Oh god.

01:17:32.532 --> 01:17:33.359
Oh my god.

01:17:37.842 --> 01:17:38.710
No!

01:17:38.712 --> 01:17:39.711
No, no!

01:17:52.682 --> 01:17:55.640
Why would you, it's our kids!

01:17:55.642 --> 01:17:56.469
Fuck, no!

01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:07.959
Manny, Manny, Manny.

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.180
Josiah, slow down.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.312
If the camera bothers him,

01:18:15.314 --> 01:18:16.791
shut it off when
I tell you, don't.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:19.098
I want to hear
what he has to say.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:19.927
Got it.

01:18:24.889 --> 01:18:26.499
Manny, Manny!

01:18:27.892 --> 01:18:30.457
J, it's been a while.

01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:32.720
Yes it has,
Manny, yes it has.

01:18:32.722 --> 01:18:34.246
Sorry about your family, man.

01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:39.858
What's that for?

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.338
It's a little side
project I got going on.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.167
Do you mind?

01:18:44.212 --> 01:18:45.779
No, I don't mind.

01:18:46.867 --> 01:18:47.997
Is that what brings you here?

01:18:47.999 --> 01:18:48.911
Partly, I need a piece.

01:18:48.913 --> 01:18:49.826
Flavor?

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:54.135
Small enough to hick,
large enough to kill.

01:18:55.223 --> 01:18:56.094
Right over here.

01:19:01.447 --> 01:19:02.274
Nine mill.

01:19:09.107 --> 01:19:10.976
It has a good feel.

01:19:10.978 --> 01:19:12.369
You can use that
at home, for defense.

01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:13.459
Bedside table.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.466
Felt good.

01:19:22.468 --> 01:19:24.207
Hard to tell the difference.

01:19:24.209 --> 01:19:25.860
Nothing but the best, baby.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:26.689
I see.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.516
You got anybody in here

01:19:29.518 --> 01:19:31.216
trying to unload
a piece recently?

01:19:33.305 --> 01:19:34.306
All the time, man.

01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:38.003
But I only get the quality.

01:19:38.005 --> 01:19:41.789
Something small, fits
in a purse, handbag.

01:19:41.791 --> 01:19:43.141
Something a chick would use.

01:19:45.056 --> 01:19:45.926
I don't know.

01:19:46.971 --> 01:19:48.276
I get all kinds of sellers.

01:19:51.192 --> 01:19:52.193
Look at me, Manny.

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:56.717
Shut if off, Laura.

01:19:56.719 --> 01:19:57.544
Okay.

01:19:57.546 --> 01:19:58.373
Answer me.

01:19:59.548 --> 01:20:01.244
We've been friends a long time.

01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:02.290
Answer me, Manny.

01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:11.080
A while back I was closing up

01:20:11.082 --> 01:20:12.603
and some woman come in

01:20:12.605 --> 01:20:14.561
wanting to unload a piece.

01:20:14.563 --> 01:20:16.433
Said she needed some money.

01:20:16.435 --> 01:20:18.567
She offered it up just
like you described.

01:20:20.004 --> 01:20:22.178
She didn't have no
paperwork or nothing.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.442
Wanted cash up front.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.226
The thing is,

01:20:27.228 --> 01:20:28.749
What, Manny?

01:20:28.751 --> 01:20:29.924
I recognized that weapon.

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:30.753
How?

01:20:34.844 --> 01:20:36.368
It was the gun
I sold your wife.

01:20:37.456 --> 01:20:38.585
Man Alisa came in here one day

01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:40.370
worried out of her mind,

01:20:40.372 --> 01:20:42.850
said you're never home and
she's getting threatening calls.

01:20:42.852 --> 01:20:45.070
Asked whether or
not I'd help her.

01:20:45.072 --> 01:20:45.986
Discreetly.

01:20:47.683 --> 01:20:49.770
You sold her
an unregistered gun?

01:20:49.772 --> 01:20:51.252
Man, we're from the streets.

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:54.603
Law and order ain't exactly
around every corner.

01:20:58.694 --> 01:21:01.043
This woman tried
to sell the gun,

01:21:01.045 --> 01:21:02.176
what did she look like?

01:21:03.395 --> 01:21:04.568
I mean, I don't know.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:05.743
I ran her ass out of here.

01:21:05.745 --> 01:21:05.962
She took the gun with her.

01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:08.052
Didn't leave a name.

01:21:09.705 --> 01:21:12.054
That gun's untraceable,
man, I left it at that.

01:21:12.056 --> 01:21:14.493
Nothing, you remember nothing?

01:21:15.929 --> 01:21:17.929
Man, my mind is shit.

01:21:17.931 --> 01:21:20.671
That's why I got these
security cameras installed.

01:21:20.673 --> 01:21:22.325
I can play it back
for you if you want.

01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:24.066
That'll help, right?

01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:25.676
Yes it would.

01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:26.592
Please.

01:21:39.822 --> 01:21:41.128
Goddamit, Norma.

01:21:46.699 --> 01:21:47.524
Norma, open up.

01:21:47.526 --> 01:21:48.353
Open up, Norma!

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:54.139
Norma, how did you get that gun?

01:21:54.141 --> 01:21:55.749
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:57.708
You know damn what the
fuck I'm talking about.

01:21:57.710 --> 01:21:59.666
How did you get Alisa's gun?

01:21:59.668 --> 01:22:00.972
I told you, asshole.

01:22:00.974 --> 01:22:02.104
I fucking told you.

01:22:02.106 --> 01:22:04.282
Get your fucking house in order.

01:22:05.239 --> 01:22:06.412
No, no, no.

01:22:06.414 --> 01:22:08.197
You had that fucking gun.

01:22:08.199 --> 01:22:09.372
She knew about everything
I was fucking doing

01:22:09.374 --> 01:22:11.200
from the fucking beginning.

01:22:11.202 --> 01:22:11.724
That don't mean that she
fucking approved of that shit!

01:22:12.812 --> 01:22:13.854
I don't wanna hear that shit.

01:22:13.856 --> 01:22:15.029
How'd you get that gun?

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:16.161
Did you take it from my house?

01:22:16.163 --> 01:22:17.684
Did you kill my fucking family?

01:22:17.686 --> 01:22:18.859
Yeah I got it from
your damn house.

01:22:18.861 --> 01:22:20.383
You killed your fucking...

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:21.949
Nah I didn't kill
my fucking family,

01:22:21.951 --> 01:22:23.516
I went in there and
it was laying in there

01:22:23.518 --> 01:22:24.519
next to her dead body
on the kitchen floor!

01:22:25.564 --> 01:22:27.041
Now come on, let's go.

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:28.521
I'm not going no
fucking where with you!

01:22:28.523 --> 01:22:29.348
You're coming with
me so we can straighten

01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:30.915
this shit out.

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:32.482
I'm not telling
nobody nothing.

01:22:32.484 --> 01:22:33.311
Besides, who gonna
believe me anyway?

01:22:35.835 --> 01:22:37.965
Where'd you put the gun?

01:22:37.967 --> 01:22:40.142
Huh, you try to
sell that shit, huh?

01:22:40.144 --> 01:22:41.665
God knows I need money.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:43.145
But I could never sell that gun.

01:22:43.147 --> 01:22:44.931
That was my sister, Wisper!

01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:47.629
You did that shit!

01:22:48.543 --> 01:22:50.023
You did that shit!

01:22:50.893 --> 01:22:52.197
You killed her.

01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:53.372
- Come on.
- She may have pulled

01:22:53.374 --> 01:22:54.373
- that trigger,
- Come on.

01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:55.896
But you did that shit,

01:22:55.898 --> 01:22:57.246
you killed your
own fucking family!

01:22:57.248 --> 01:22:59.857
Fuck you Josiah, fuck you too,

01:22:59.859 --> 01:23:02.164
get the fuck outta here!

01:23:43.946 --> 01:23:45.774
It was all my fault.

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.653
She could have just
told me to stop.

01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:11.844
I didn't do nothing.

01:30:10.592 --> 01:30:15.592
