WEBVTT

00:33.017 --> 00:36.253
Why can't we light a fire?

00:36.387 --> 00:38.588
So we can see the sky better.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.326
Come. Want to look?

00:42.460 --> 00:43.693
Nuh-uh.

00:43.827 --> 00:45.829
But we came all this way.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.797
Don't you want to see
the eclipse?

00:47.931 --> 00:50.001
I'm cold. I want to go to bed.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.904
Okay. Okay.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.276
Let's go. Get in.

01:02.046 --> 01:05.248
Okay.

01:07.051 --> 01:09.253
I will make a fire
in the morning.

01:11.588 --> 01:14.158
Do you know how much I love you?

01:18.795 --> 01:20.998
This much.

01:25.236 --> 01:26.636
'Night, Ro.

01:29.572 --> 01:33.144
'Night, bunny.

02:03.507 --> 02:05.708
Ah.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.083
Mommy?

02:49.320 --> 02:51.322
Mommy?

03:10.274 --> 03:11.708
Mommy?

03:11.841 --> 03:14.111
What's going on?

03:14.245 --> 03:17.248
It's not snow!

03:17.381 --> 03:19.682
Isn't it beautiful?

04:53.210 --> 04:58.015
Don't be scared, honey.

04:58.148 --> 05:01.518
Don't worry.
I'll hold on to you.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.723
Do you know how much I love you?
This much.

05:08.492 --> 05:10.494
Don't touch me!

05:10.628 --> 05:11.794
Oh, Ro, shh, shh.

05:11.928 --> 05:15.432
It's okay.
Hey, it's me. I'm here.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.634
Uh, yeah.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.402
Hey, it's okay, honey.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.803
You're okay.

05:20.937 --> 05:22.872
Hi.

05:23.007 --> 05:24.541
Is she okay?

05:24.675 --> 05:27.011
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, Aurora?

05:27.144 --> 05:30.681
How long have you been
using drugs?

05:30.813 --> 05:33.117
Since I was a kid.

05:33.250 --> 05:37.787
She was in some pretty intense
therapy when she was younger.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.625
What were you in therapy for?

05:41.759 --> 05:43.527
How much time do you have?

05:43.661 --> 05:46.196
Her mother, my sister,

05:46.330 --> 05:48.732
died when she was a little girl.

05:48.865 --> 05:53.470
She didn't die. She disappeared.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.972
She was just a little girl,

05:55.105 --> 05:58.808
and she was very scared
and all alone,

05:58.941 --> 06:01.211
and you know how it is
with kids.

06:01.345 --> 06:02.879
They build up these things. Ro!

06:03.013 --> 06:04.847
- Ro, Ro? Please don't.

06:04.982 --> 06:06.849
- Get back!
- Excuse me.

06:06.984 --> 06:08.052
Ro, please don't go.

06:08.185 --> 06:11.121
Aurora! And I'm sorry.

06:11.255 --> 06:12.323
Ro?

06:12.456 --> 06:14.191
Paging Dr. Trudeau.

06:14.325 --> 06:15.592
Dr. Greg Trudeau,
please report to...

06:15.726 --> 06:17.027
Aurora?

06:19.129 --> 06:22.299
Aurora? Excuse me.

06:22.433 --> 06:23.734
Don't go.

06:23.866 --> 06:26.236
Ro. Ro!

08:07.504 --> 08:08.972
Hello.

08:09.106 --> 08:10.974
Can I help you?

08:11.108 --> 08:13.477
Um, did someone
just come in here?

08:13.610 --> 08:15.712
Besides you?

08:18.215 --> 08:20.851
Um, is there a bathroom
I could use?

08:20.984 --> 08:24.188
Yeah. Over there.

09:04.061 --> 09:05.996
Looking for something
in particular?

09:06.129 --> 09:09.066
No. Just browsing.

09:09.199 --> 09:11.768
Maybe I could recommend
something.

09:11.902 --> 09:14.104
I don't need help.

09:15.172 --> 09:16.273
Okay.

09:16.406 --> 09:18.609
I'll leave you alone, then.

09:21.712 --> 09:23.714
Uh, wait.

09:27.885 --> 09:29.319
Hey.

09:30.621 --> 09:34.758
No, no. No, no. Don't cry.
Aw.

09:34.892 --> 09:37.394
We all have bad days.

09:37.528 --> 09:38.428
Oh.

09:38.562 --> 09:41.064
I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.200
I don't judge.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.701
Unless you were actually
going to buy that.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.937
Then, maybe I would've.

09:47.070 --> 09:50.073
No. It's pretty stupid.

09:50.207 --> 09:51.642
Well, especially that one.

09:51.775 --> 09:56.213
It's just a bunch of
recycled conspiracy theories.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.181
But I have something

09:58.315 --> 10:02.553
that you might like.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.789
Ah. This.

10:05.923 --> 10:10.127
This is something else entirely.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.932
"Elyse"?

10:15.065 --> 10:17.367
No last name? Is she like Cher?

10:17.501 --> 10:20.804
Well, Elyse isn't like anybody.

10:20.938 --> 10:22.806
She's a visionary.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.745
Is this a joke?

10:28.879 --> 10:30.147
Not to me.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.983
No. I saw her.
She came into the store.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.851
Yeah.

10:34.986 --> 10:38.221
Elyse has
a way of finding people.

10:43.594 --> 10:46.965
Thanks.

10:47.097 --> 10:50.734
Ooh. "Aurora." I love your name.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.736
Cosmic.

10:54.171 --> 10:58.009
Yeah. My mom loved
the stars, so...

10:58.141 --> 10:59.610
I'm Natalie, by the way.

11:02.846 --> 11:04.147
All right.

11:04.281 --> 11:07.150
Let me know what you think
about the book.

11:07.284 --> 11:08.352
Yeah, I will.

11:08.485 --> 11:11.755
I don't know what you're up to

11:11.888 --> 11:13.924
this weekend,

11:14.058 --> 11:15.659
but I'm getting together with
a bunch of friends

11:15.792 --> 11:16.893
if you want to join.

11:17.028 --> 11:19.196
Yeah. Maybe.

11:19.329 --> 11:21.798
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

11:25.369 --> 11:27.804
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.475
This weekend in London

12:38.608 --> 12:41.511
marks the final eclipse
of the lunar tetrad.

12:41.645 --> 12:43.114
This event is quite rare,

12:43.246 --> 12:46.050
having occurred a mere 62 times
since the first century.

12:46.184 --> 12:49.920
Of course, this has created all
sorts of so-called prophecies

12:50.054 --> 12:51.288
throughout history.

12:51.421 --> 12:54.257
Even the name "blood moon"

12:54.391 --> 12:56.593
evokes a sense of doom.

12:59.563 --> 13:01.264
There will be wonders
in the heavens

13:01.398 --> 13:04.035
and signs on the earth.

13:04.168 --> 13:06.536
The sun will turn into darkness
and the moon to blood

13:06.670 --> 13:08.371
before the great
and glorious day

13:08.505 --> 13:12.476
when he returns.

13:12.609 --> 13:15.412
Perhaps ,

13:15.545 --> 13:17.514
although I don't think
the rapture

13:17.647 --> 13:19.183
is scheduled for this weekend.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.818
Aurora? Hey, Ro.

13:21.953 --> 13:24.921
Blood moon?

13:25.056 --> 13:27.024
In class?

13:27.158 --> 13:29.259
What are the odds?

13:29.392 --> 13:30.962
It must be a sign.

13:31.095 --> 13:33.231
Stop following me, Dieter.

13:33.363 --> 13:36.500
You've left me no choice.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.603
You didn't return
my phone calls.

13:43.207 --> 13:45.375
She came back.

13:48.445 --> 13:50.514
Just like she said she would.

13:50.647 --> 13:52.849
- Fuck off and...
- You belong with us.

13:57.788 --> 14:00.357
You belong with us.

14:00.490 --> 14:03.693
Next time I see you,
I'm calling the police.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.468
We're sorry. You have reached
a number that is disconnected

14:45.602 --> 14:47.804
or is no longer in service.

15:40.557 --> 15:41.825
Hey.

15:41.959 --> 15:45.029
You made it.

15:45.162 --> 15:47.631
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't hear from you.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.736
Didn't you say that your friends
were going to be here?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.804
They are.

16:01.678 --> 16:03.880
My friends
are dying to meet you.

16:05.815 --> 16:07.517
You tell them that I was coming?

16:07.651 --> 16:10.121
I told them you might.

16:10.254 --> 16:13.623
It turns out I was right.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.759
I hope you like karaoke.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.560
Yeah.

16:45.488 --> 16:48.392
Elyse, this is Aurora.

16:48.525 --> 16:50.361
She's the one
I was telling you about.

16:50.493 --> 16:53.496
Yeah. Hello.

16:53.630 --> 16:57.500
And this is Mizuki,

16:57.634 --> 16:59.070
our resident bad-ass.

16:59.203 --> 17:01.771
Natalie tells us
many great things.

17:01.905 --> 17:04.473
Oh. Well, we just met, so...

17:04.607 --> 17:06.310
Natalie says you read my book.

17:06.444 --> 17:07.979
Yeah.

17:08.112 --> 17:12.349
And? What did you think?

17:12.482 --> 17:16.020
Uh, it was interesting.

17:16.153 --> 17:18.955
Whoa.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.058
That's a way of saying
you didn't like something.

17:21.192 --> 17:22.726
No.

17:22.858 --> 17:26.196
No, I didn't mean it like that.

17:26.329 --> 17:30.533
I've read so many books
about UFOs and stuff.

17:30.667 --> 17:34.671
But your book was...

17:34.804 --> 17:38.209
Your book was like reading about
my own experience.

17:38.342 --> 17:42.712
Maybe you were.

17:42.846 --> 17:45.782
Join us.

18:08.973 --> 18:12.642
One, two, three.
One, two, three. Testing.

18:12.776 --> 18:14.245
Before we get started,

18:14.378 --> 18:18.382
I would love to thank Zee
for making tonight possible.

18:20.317 --> 18:24.654
Zee?

18:24.788 --> 18:26.190
Thank you.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.892
I'm really happy to be here
tonight

18:29.026 --> 18:31.228
for this special occasion.

18:34.131 --> 18:35.533
Everyone.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.502
Thanks, you guys.

18:38.635 --> 18:40.737
But the real reason
we're here tonight

18:40.870 --> 18:42.939
is because of Aurora.

18:43.074 --> 18:45.309
Whoa!

18:56.020 --> 18:57.388
So,

18:57.521 --> 19:01.258
tell us why you're here,
Aurora.

19:01.392 --> 19:05.096
Uh, Natalie invited me.

19:08.332 --> 19:10.267
Go inside.

19:10.401 --> 19:12.336
Deep here.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.707
I'm sure you know.

19:17.841 --> 19:21.778
Know what?

19:21.911 --> 19:24.415
That you were not invited,

19:24.548 --> 19:26.749
Aurora.

19:32.556 --> 19:36.160
You were chosen.

19:36.293 --> 19:39.163
Your mother

19:39.296 --> 19:41.098
is Iris DeLuce.

19:41.232 --> 19:43.367
Abducted,

19:43.501 --> 19:47.171
June 8, 1997.

19:47.304 --> 19:49.006
It's okay.

19:52.209 --> 19:54.512
You moved here
after the encounter

19:54.644 --> 19:58.482
to live with your aunt Caroline.

19:58.616 --> 20:02.852
You were just a girl.

20:02.987 --> 20:05.189
How do you know that?

20:05.322 --> 20:08.658
Tell her, birdies.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.996
December 10, 2011. Japan.

20:14.565 --> 20:17.767
February 21, 2008.

20:17.901 --> 20:20.070
Canada.

20:20.204 --> 20:24.707
Kami, October 27, 2004.
Ireland.

20:24.841 --> 20:29.679
Dinesh, April 14, 2014.
India.

20:29.812 --> 20:34.618
Winston, May 27, 2006.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.287
Jamaica.

20:36.420 --> 20:39.023
Naveed, July 5, 1982.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.625
Iran.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.260
Solévar,

20:43.394 --> 20:45.663
August 22, 2007.

20:45.795 --> 20:47.998
Peru.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.171
The blood moon
brought us here...

20:56.739 --> 20:59.577
From all over the world,

20:59.709 --> 21:01.945
like a magnetic force.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.451
We're witnesses.

21:07.585 --> 21:10.187
Just like you.

21:10.321 --> 21:14.857
Who wants to share
their encounter with Aurora?

21:14.992 --> 21:17.194
It's okay. Really.

21:40.783 --> 21:43.087
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.822
Oh, I just need a bit of air.

21:48.459 --> 21:49.859
You know, the first time
is really intense.

21:49.994 --> 21:51.794
I don't understand.

21:53.530 --> 21:55.366
Who is she?

21:55.499 --> 21:57.268
When I first met Elyse,

21:57.401 --> 22:00.903
she knew everything about
my encounter, too.

22:02.172 --> 22:06.143
It's a process of discovery
and acceptance,

22:06.277 --> 22:10.381
but Elyse saved my life,
and I really...

22:12.082 --> 22:14.051
You know what? Never mind.

22:14.184 --> 22:16.020
- What?
- No. Nothing.

22:16.153 --> 22:17.554
You know what? We're going to do
some karaoke.

22:17.688 --> 22:18.921
So, come back inside.

22:19.056 --> 22:21.791
Wait. No.
What were you going to tell me?

22:25.596 --> 22:29.099
Elyse has a place up north,

22:29.233 --> 22:30.867
and the rest of us
are going up this weekend.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.603
She wants you to come.

22:32.736 --> 22:34.471
Uh...

22:34.605 --> 22:37.541
I know. I get it.
Too much, too soon.

22:37.675 --> 22:39.410
Next time.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.814
Well, when are you leaving?

22:48.152 --> 22:50.454
You're not going to regret it.

22:50.587 --> 22:53.190
But first, karaoke.

23:26.557 --> 23:29.626
Hey.

23:31.195 --> 23:32.463
Your phone was disconnected.

23:32.596 --> 23:34.832
I was worried
something happened to you.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.036
Can you just let me in, please?

24:14.405 --> 24:16.039
So, what have you been up to?

24:16.173 --> 24:20.077
Why are you here, Ro?

24:24.415 --> 24:25.783
I thought that
we could have dinner together,

24:25.915 --> 24:28.085
like we used to.

24:30.087 --> 24:32.556
That was a long time ago.

24:39.929 --> 24:41.732
I saw Dieter.

24:41.865 --> 24:44.435
So?

24:44.568 --> 24:48.272
So, Dieter also said that
Elyse was back,

24:48.405 --> 24:50.841
which is obviously insane.

24:50.974 --> 24:52.476
No. So is Dieter.

25:00.484 --> 25:02.119
I know that you probably
don't want to see me,

25:02.252 --> 25:07.224
which I totally get, but...

25:09.026 --> 25:12.329
No, it's okay.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.570
I'm glad you came.

25:21.405 --> 25:25.008
Thanks for saying that.

25:25.142 --> 25:28.345
God. I just want it to stop.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.517
It will.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.422
Hello?

26:12.556 --> 26:13.690
Hello. I'm here to pick you up.

26:13.824 --> 26:14.892
I'll be right down.

26:32.142 --> 26:33.210
Hi.

26:33.343 --> 26:37.047
Aurora? Hi. I'm Dieter.

26:37.180 --> 26:40.651
Where's Natalie?

26:40.784 --> 26:42.286
Oh, she's going to
meet us there.

26:42.419 --> 26:44.254
Do you have everything you need?

26:46.390 --> 26:48.292
Okay. Well, we have
a long drive,

26:48.425 --> 26:51.695
so come on. Hop in.

26:55.098 --> 26:57.301
Okay. There you go.

27:18.422 --> 27:19.890
Hey.

27:20.024 --> 27:23.527
Come. Sit up front.

27:23.660 --> 27:24.728
I won't bite.

27:24.861 --> 27:28.032
I'm just a pussycat.

27:28.165 --> 27:32.603
Come on. It's okay.

27:38.675 --> 27:39.743
Nervous?

27:39.876 --> 27:41.211
A little.

27:41.345 --> 27:42.981
Everyone is at first.

27:43.113 --> 27:47.217
It's just that Natalie said she
was going to pick me up, so...

27:47.351 --> 27:49.286
She's too important for pickups.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.687
That's why Elyse sent me.

27:53.123 --> 27:54.691
Why does everyone call her Zee?

27:54.825 --> 27:55.926
Why is the sky blue?

27:56.060 --> 27:58.562
You know,

27:58.695 --> 28:03.367
a lot of phonies
try to slip by me,

28:03.500 --> 28:05.636
but they always reveal
themselves.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.237
I'm not a phony.

28:07.371 --> 28:09.073
That's what everyone says.

28:09.206 --> 28:10.807
- Well, I'm not.
- Mm-hmm.

28:10.941 --> 28:15.646
June 8, 1997.

28:17.881 --> 28:21.818
May 4, 1985.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.941
Hello?

28:45.076 --> 28:49.047
Wake up.
We have a long way to go.

28:49.179 --> 28:53.383
Come on.
Don't forget your suitcase.

29:01.625 --> 29:03.860
Let's go.

29:17.108 --> 29:20.111
Very, very cold...

29:20.243 --> 29:22.512
...this morning.

29:22.646 --> 29:25.215
Where are we going?

29:25.348 --> 29:29.219
Don't worry. It's very nice.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.855
Come.

29:34.391 --> 29:36.593
Come on.

30:34.118 --> 30:36.920
Hey, you guys.

30:41.391 --> 30:43.894
Ah. There you go.

30:44.028 --> 30:47.131
Hi. Welcome.

30:47.265 --> 30:50.101
You never said it was so remote.

30:50.234 --> 30:53.137
I know. Amazing, right?
Wait till you see the place.

30:53.271 --> 30:55.106
Come.

30:55.239 --> 30:58.276
Hey, it's this way, huh?

30:58.408 --> 31:01.611
Careful. Watch your step.

31:03.580 --> 31:05.782
Watch for the bears.

31:07.584 --> 31:08.986
It's a joke.

31:12.722 --> 31:15.625
I wish you would've told me that
you weren't going to pick me up.

31:15.759 --> 31:16.961
Oh. I thought I did.

31:17.094 --> 31:20.397
Why? Did something happen
with Dieter?

31:20.530 --> 31:21.999
No. It's just a bit intense.

31:22.133 --> 31:25.069
Right. He's really
just a pussycat

31:25.203 --> 31:26.270
once you get to know him.

31:26.403 --> 31:28.405
He said the same thing.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.440
No, it's true.

31:30.574 --> 31:32.609
If he seems protective,

31:32.742 --> 31:35.946
it's only because he's been
with Elyse the longest.

31:42.752 --> 31:47.524
I'll take this to your room.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.828
Let me show you around.

31:57.901 --> 31:59.870
Where did these all come from?

32:00.004 --> 32:03.940
It's a mystery. Elyse had
a vision that led her here.

32:04.075 --> 32:07.011
She says these heads
were probably erected

32:07.144 --> 32:08.212
by ancestral witnesses.

32:08.346 --> 32:11.082
Wild, huh?

32:11.215 --> 32:13.017
And you believe that?

32:13.150 --> 32:14.451
Well, why wouldn't I?

32:14.584 --> 32:16.786
They can't explain
Easter Island, either.

32:22.392 --> 32:24.594
Look who's here.

32:24.728 --> 32:28.366
Winston was an architect
in Kingston,

32:28.498 --> 32:31.735
and Kami was in construction
when she wasn't kicking ass.

32:31.868 --> 32:36.007
They're a crucial part of
what we've built out here.

32:37.807 --> 32:39.943
Where's the house?

32:40.077 --> 32:42.079
It's not a house.

32:44.215 --> 32:46.850
We call it the mother ship.

32:55.825 --> 32:58.428
Before Elyse remodelled
the place

32:58.561 --> 32:59.964
it was an old tunnel system,

33:00.097 --> 33:02.799
probably dug out
with primitive tools.

33:02.933 --> 33:04.668
And the renovations
were all done

33:04.801 --> 33:08.738
to plans she'd laid out
in the book.

33:08.872 --> 33:11.375
- Hola, Sol.
- Hola.

33:11.508 --> 33:16.013
Sol ran a flower shop
in Iquitos in her former life,

33:16.147 --> 33:19.016
and we would be so lost
without her.

33:19.150 --> 33:23.553
You'll see why. I mean, her
plants are out of this world.

33:24.888 --> 33:27.191
And this is
where we usually meet.

33:27.325 --> 33:29.526
Uh, goggles, Dinesh.

33:33.030 --> 33:37.335
Dinesh rigged lights
on big Bollywood productions

33:37.467 --> 33:38.735
in his former life.

33:38.868 --> 33:39.971
Oh, wow.

33:40.104 --> 33:41.705
And this is
where the lessons take place.

33:41.838 --> 33:43.940
Full stomach, full mind
kind of deal.

33:44.075 --> 33:47.677
Lots of protein.
Strictly poultry.

33:47.811 --> 33:50.647
And that is Elyse's room.

33:50.780 --> 33:53.717
The private tutorials happen
back there,

33:53.850 --> 33:56.087
but only on special occasions.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.222
And your room...

34:03.461 --> 34:04.894
Is down here.

34:05.029 --> 34:07.931
Elyse prepared it
especially for you,

34:08.065 --> 34:10.266
to help you get used to life
out here.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.271
I never said I was staying.

34:14.405 --> 34:16.672
Oh. Neither did I, at first.

34:25.581 --> 34:27.784
Thank you, Naveed.

34:35.192 --> 34:36.659
What's with the bow?

34:36.793 --> 34:38.928
Well, I'm Nazeena.

34:39.063 --> 34:43.167
- Like the warrior princess?
- No.

34:43.300 --> 34:45.635
With a "Z," not an "X."

34:45.768 --> 34:48.105
It means "key."

34:48.239 --> 34:51.074
Or "gate,"
depending on the context.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.710
It's in the glossary,
which you should memorize.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.246
Things will make
so much more sense.

34:55.379 --> 34:59.083
But you can call me Natalie.
I kind of prefer it.

34:59.216 --> 35:01.352
Yeah.

35:01.485 --> 35:04.188
You must be dying to freshen up.

35:10.528 --> 35:11.928
Hmm.

35:12.063 --> 35:16.200
My first night here,
I had the best sleep of my life.

35:16.333 --> 35:20.737
Something about this place
just clears your mind.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.306
The cleanse helps, too.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.141
Cleanse?

35:24.275 --> 35:25.809
Mm-hmm.

35:25.942 --> 35:27.445
Diet is a critical part
of the preparation.

35:27.577 --> 35:29.913
For what?

35:30.047 --> 35:34.251
They return
for those who bear witness...

35:35.718 --> 35:39.123
And prepare for their return.

35:39.256 --> 35:41.292
You know? Like us.

35:41.425 --> 35:44.495
Good morning, birdies.

35:44.627 --> 35:47.831
Breakfast will be served shortly
in the dining room.

35:47.965 --> 35:50.434
Please be on time, okay?

35:50.568 --> 35:53.504
And let's make our best effort

35:53.636 --> 35:56.474
to make Aurora feel at home.

35:56.606 --> 36:00.544
Aurora, this song goes out
for you.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.725
I'm really glad you're here.

37:07.478 --> 37:09.679
Tom?

38:03.400 --> 38:05.102
I'm leaving.

38:05.236 --> 38:06.403
Huh?

38:06.537 --> 38:08.005
On a jet plane?

38:10.241 --> 38:12.209
Hey.

38:12.343 --> 38:13.776
Aurora?

38:13.910 --> 38:16.413
Ro, wait.

38:41.138 --> 38:43.307
Hey! Looking good.

38:43.440 --> 38:46.443
It's not really my style,
but it's sort of comfortable.

38:46.577 --> 38:48.479
I know. They're better than
pyjamas, right?

38:48.612 --> 38:50.347
Here.

38:55.019 --> 38:58.555
Aurora, this is my husband, Tom.

38:58.689 --> 38:59.757
Hey.

39:02.792 --> 39:05.895
Um, could you please make one of
your legendary smoothies?

39:06.030 --> 39:08.831
She's beginning her cleanse.

39:08.966 --> 39:10.367
Lucky you.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.115
You know, today, I want to hear

39:25.249 --> 39:28.885
a real loud one for Aurora...

39:30.254 --> 39:31.789
...for finding her way.

39:33.823 --> 39:35.925
Okay. Thank you.

39:36.060 --> 39:38.529
You know,
we should all congratulate Zee,

39:38.662 --> 39:42.932
whose astral exercises
are going very well.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.470
- Woo-hoo!
- Okay.

39:46.603 --> 39:47.705
Thank you. Thanks.

39:47.837 --> 39:51.775
Well, to mark this special day,

39:51.908 --> 39:54.278
I would love to start
with a reading

39:54.411 --> 39:59.116
from the Book of Tetrad
in the original Reptine.

40:02.586 --> 40:06.123
"To the witnesses,
it was said..."

40:17.768 --> 40:21.438
Thank you, Tom.

40:31.648 --> 40:34.251
Okay. Enough.

40:39.289 --> 40:40.457
May we reach The Dawn.

40:40.591 --> 40:43.926
Okay. Enough preaching.

40:44.061 --> 40:46.096
Let's eat.

40:50.734 --> 40:52.336
This is not Kool-Aid.

40:52.469 --> 40:55.339
You look good, Aurora.

40:55.472 --> 40:58.842
That colour is perfect on you.

41:32.876 --> 41:35.012
Did you get it all out?

41:35.145 --> 41:38.048
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

41:39.917 --> 41:42.219
Here. Let me help you.

41:42.352 --> 41:44.288
All right. There we go.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.490
Sorry.

41:46.623 --> 41:48.425
Supposedly, it's supposed to
make you more receptive

41:48.559 --> 41:50.427
to the signals.

41:50.561 --> 41:53.964
But, uh, it's really just mostly
kale and cayenne pepper.

41:56.099 --> 41:58.769
And hey, hey.
It happens to everybody.

41:58.902 --> 42:01.205
Sorry.

42:01.338 --> 42:05.008
Natalie never told me
she had a husband.

42:05.142 --> 42:06.543
Yeah? Well, she does,

42:06.677 --> 42:10.113
and it's me.

42:10.247 --> 42:11.982
So, are you from the city?

42:12.115 --> 42:13.383
No. Not originally.

42:13.517 --> 42:15.018
I moved out here
to be with my aunt

42:15.152 --> 42:18.889
after my mom disappeared.

42:19.022 --> 42:20.290
What about you?

42:20.424 --> 42:23.627
Uh, I'm not really from here.

42:23.760 --> 42:28.599
I really just kind of
ended up here.

42:28.732 --> 42:30.467
Like me.

42:30.601 --> 42:32.903
Yeah, I guess.

42:33.036 --> 42:34.304
So, what's your aunt's name?

42:34.438 --> 42:35.739
Caroline.

42:35.873 --> 42:36.940
She know you're here?

42:37.074 --> 42:39.276
- No. God, no.
- Mm-hmm.

42:39.409 --> 42:41.478
She already thinks I'm crazy.

42:41.612 --> 42:43.614
Are you?

42:45.315 --> 42:47.518
Do I seem like I am?

42:50.087 --> 42:52.289
It's too early to tell.

43:05.669 --> 43:08.839
Caroline?

43:08.973 --> 43:13.277
Ro.

43:13.410 --> 43:15.746
- Were you followed?
- I don't know. Maybe.

43:16.947 --> 43:19.017
Where's your laptop?

43:19.149 --> 43:21.418
Over there.

43:21.552 --> 43:23.487
Dieter was cruising
around the block earlier.

43:23.620 --> 43:27.124
You know there's a blood moon
this weekend, right?

43:28.592 --> 43:30.627
The ability of the human mind

43:30.761 --> 43:32.462
to convince itself
of just about anything,

43:32.596 --> 43:35.465
it never ceases to amaze me.

44:06.998 --> 44:08.832
That was her.

44:08.967 --> 44:12.169
She probably made that years
ago, just to fit her narrative.

44:17.474 --> 44:20.410
Okay, honey. Here.

44:21.878 --> 44:24.015
It's to protect you.

44:24.147 --> 44:26.650
I would, but...

44:37.996 --> 44:40.098
So, how do you like it?

44:40.230 --> 44:42.432
It's not what I expected.

44:42.566 --> 44:44.334
And all from a book.

44:44.468 --> 44:45.736
Have you read it?

44:45.869 --> 44:47.771
Ooh. Great stuff.

44:47.904 --> 44:51.009
Especially the parts about, uh,
channelling the star source

44:51.141 --> 44:52.442
and interstellar projection.

44:52.576 --> 44:56.047
Have you had an encounter?

44:56.179 --> 44:59.182
Yeah. Probed, twice.

44:59.316 --> 45:02.753
Although the second time
was my choice.

45:02.886 --> 45:04.187
No, no.

45:04.321 --> 45:07.058
It was, uh, Natalie
who had the encounter,

45:07.190 --> 45:09.359
or so she says.

45:09.493 --> 45:11.328
You don't believe her?

45:11.461 --> 45:14.098
I believe that she believes
she did.

45:14.231 --> 45:16.500
Put it that way.

45:22.472 --> 45:24.675
If you believe that, then
why are you doing here?

45:27.210 --> 45:30.414
Well... because
I love her.

45:41.458 --> 45:42.726
It's in the book.

45:55.338 --> 45:58.442
I came by, and you
were not here.

45:58.575 --> 46:01.778
Uh... Yeah.
I was outside.

46:04.881 --> 46:07.085
It was so hard,
losing her.

46:07.217 --> 46:08.618
Wasn't it?

46:10.253 --> 46:12.656
Tell me,

46:12.789 --> 46:15.659
what did you
see that night?

46:15.792 --> 46:17.794
You know I was just
a kid when it happened.

46:17.928 --> 46:20.098
Things get built up
in your mind.

46:20.230 --> 46:22.432
I'm a good listener.

46:23.366 --> 46:24.735
Unlike most
people you know,

46:24.868 --> 46:26.236
I'm sure.

46:26.369 --> 46:27.804
Come.

46:27.938 --> 46:29.339
Okay.

46:32.210 --> 46:33.610
Mm.

46:36.413 --> 46:37.481
Um...

46:42.886 --> 46:45.822
We were camping
in the woods

46:45.957 --> 46:48.592
to see the eclipse.

46:48.725 --> 46:51.495
And when I woke up,
there was all this light,

46:51.628 --> 46:53.030
and my mom was gone.

46:54.564 --> 46:56.767
So I followed the light.

46:59.003 --> 47:01.005
I was so scared.

47:03.774 --> 47:06.010
I just want to
see my mom again.

47:06.144 --> 47:07.544
And you will.

47:09.180 --> 47:11.048
That's why
you are here.

47:28.232 --> 47:31.635
They talk to us
through living things, Aurora.

48:49.213 --> 48:52.616
This is where they will
return for us.

48:54.618 --> 48:56.820
The landing site.

48:56.954 --> 48:59.522
Wanted to show
it to you personally.

49:01.758 --> 49:03.961
How did you
know about my mother?

49:04.794 --> 49:06.998
Your mother told me.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.703
I was sent to
find you, Aurora.

49:15.572 --> 49:18.942
Hmm. I see
you're skeptical.

49:20.710 --> 49:22.913
It's not easy
to accept.

49:24.148 --> 49:25.548
But it's true.

49:28.352 --> 49:30.420
What did my mother say?

49:32.455 --> 49:36.193
If I tell you, I want you to
do something for me first.

49:41.431 --> 49:42.832
Jump.

49:47.138 --> 49:49.040
You're joking, right?

49:50.041 --> 49:50.907
That's up to you.

49:58.648 --> 50:02.719
Hmm. Your mother said
she loves you...

50:04.288 --> 50:05.156
Ro.

50:12.595 --> 50:14.798
It's alright.

50:16.733 --> 50:18.601
It's alright.

50:20.470 --> 50:21.871
It's okay.

50:27.777 --> 50:31.248
Hey. Race you back.

50:31.382 --> 50:32.249
Okay?

51:18.229 --> 51:19.096
Hello?

51:27.737 --> 51:29.939
It's me. Hey.

51:32.109 --> 51:33.643
You took it. Why?

51:33.777 --> 51:35.645
Why didn't
you tell me?

51:35.779 --> 51:37.081
I was protecting you!

51:37.214 --> 51:39.183
Dieter was using me
to get to you.

51:39.316 --> 51:40.950
He wanted me to
show you the video.

51:41.085 --> 51:42.386
I said no.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.954
You took the bait anyway.

51:44.088 --> 51:45.822
She's supposed
to be dead!

51:45.956 --> 51:47.557
Aurora, that's what they want.

51:47.690 --> 51:50.027
It's mind games.

51:50.161 --> 51:53.563
Then we need to
do something!

51:58.235 --> 51:59.636
Yeah.

52:00.471 --> 52:01.439
Alright.

52:21.758 --> 52:23.693
How are you?

52:23.827 --> 52:26.696
Hey, good morning,
everyone.

52:26.830 --> 52:28.232
How'd you guys
sleep last night?

52:28.365 --> 52:29.233
Hi.

52:35.573 --> 52:37.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:37.241 --> 52:38.842
I had a dream about
you last night.

52:38.976 --> 52:41.112
A good one, I hope.

52:42.346 --> 52:44.148
We were planning to
kill somebody.

52:45.483 --> 52:46.816
Really? Who?

52:48.352 --> 52:49.719
Everyone.

52:54.058 --> 52:57.495
You know, today,
I woke up,

52:57.627 --> 53:01.165
and I felt that it would be
so beautiful to start the day

53:01.298 --> 53:03.800
singing a song.

53:03.933 --> 53:06.003
- Would you like?
- Singalong time.

53:06.137 --> 53:07.605
- If you want to sing...
- Coffee?

53:07.737 --> 53:09.240
Go ahead.

53:09.373 --> 53:11.142
- Black, like your soul.
- If you want to dance,

53:11.275 --> 53:13.643
- please let yourself go.
- You got it.

53:13.776 --> 53:15.379
Go ahead. Cry.

55:40.024 --> 55:42.226
I have something
for you.

55:43.994 --> 55:46.297
Oh, Tom.
Thank you.

55:46.430 --> 55:48.465
Yeah. Well, don't get
too excited.

55:48.599 --> 55:49.899
It's gluten-free, so...

55:50.034 --> 55:51.502
That's okay.

55:51.635 --> 55:53.437
So, I was looking
for you yesterday.

55:53.570 --> 55:54.638
I was with Elyse.

55:54.772 --> 55:58.309
Oh. Where...
where'd you go?

55:58.442 --> 56:01.811
We went to
this beautiful cliff.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.081
Did she ask you to jump?

56:05.948 --> 56:07.451
I mean, that's
the whole thing, right?

56:07.584 --> 56:09.620
She asks you to jump, and
then you're supposed to have

56:09.753 --> 56:11.488
some kind of
special insight?

56:11.622 --> 56:12.889
But I didn't jump.

56:13.023 --> 56:15.659
No.
Nobody does.

56:15.793 --> 56:18.128
It... it's a loyalty test.

56:18.262 --> 56:21.265
It's about the fear and
the trembling, all that stuff.

56:21.398 --> 56:24.802
No, but... she knew
things about my mother

56:24.934 --> 56:27.104
that she couldn't
have possibly know.

56:27.237 --> 56:30.940
Well, yeah. No. She
has that effect on people.

56:31.075 --> 56:32.643
What effect?

56:32.776 --> 56:34.844
She... gets them to believe

56:34.978 --> 56:36.879
that she has special powers,

56:37.014 --> 56:38.148
that kind of thing.

56:38.282 --> 56:39.683
Maybe there's
a reason for that.

56:39.817 --> 56:42.653
Because she tells people what
they want to hear.

56:42.786 --> 56:45.855
Uh... I mean, how much do you
really know about her?

56:46.990 --> 56:49.793
How much do I really
know about you?

56:49.926 --> 56:52.129
Well...

56:56.800 --> 56:57.934
Zena!

56:59.269 --> 57:00.903
Okay. Shh. It's okay.

57:01.038 --> 57:03.073
It's okay. Okay.

57:03.207 --> 57:05.476
It's okay. It's okay.

57:05.609 --> 57:07.311
Natalie! Natalie!

57:07.444 --> 57:09.279
- It's okay. She's okay.
- What did you do?

57:09.413 --> 57:10.681
- Somebody help her!
- Shh.

57:12.850 --> 57:14.718
- Natalie!
- It's okay. It's okay.

57:14.852 --> 57:15.719
Hey, what's going on?

57:15.853 --> 57:17.154
Fuck off! Fuck off!

57:17.287 --> 57:18.822
- Stop it! Stop it!
- She's fine! She's fine!

57:18.956 --> 57:20.457
- She's fine.
- Calm down, please.

57:20.591 --> 57:22.860
It's okay.
She's fine. She's fine.

57:22.993 --> 57:24.361
Come here, my darling.

57:27.164 --> 57:28.832
Come on. I'm
here. Talk to me.

57:28.966 --> 57:31.969
- She's okay.
- They are speaking to her.

57:32.102 --> 57:33.237
And they
are saying...

57:35.905 --> 57:37.641
They are
watching us.

57:40.978 --> 57:42.912
And they are
coming back.

57:46.350 --> 57:48.085
When
Zena unlocks the door.

57:48.218 --> 57:49.286
That's okay, my darling)

57:51.021 --> 57:52.089
That's okay.

57:52.222 --> 57:53.323
That's okay.

57:56.827 --> 57:58.095
Calm down. Calm down.

57:59.929 --> 58:01.532
It's okay, my love.

58:01.665 --> 58:05.035
It's okay, my love.
Come here. Come here.

58:05.169 --> 58:08.071
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

58:08.205 --> 58:10.207
You were perfect.

58:10.340 --> 58:13.644
Okay. Let's take her in.

58:13.777 --> 58:15.012
Please help me.

58:15.145 --> 58:17.080
Okay. Let's go.

58:17.214 --> 58:19.616
It's perfect, my love.

58:20.984 --> 58:24.521
Oh, my sweetheart,
it's okay.

58:24.655 --> 58:26.523
It's okay. Come on.

58:33.664 --> 58:36.400
Not everyone can
communicate with them.

58:38.869 --> 58:40.571
She has a rare gift.

58:42.573 --> 58:44.441
Tell that to Tom.

58:44.575 --> 58:46.577
I don't have to.

58:47.778 --> 58:49.646
He already knows.

59:03.193 --> 59:04.528
Alright. When we
get inside,

59:04.661 --> 59:06.965
just let me do
the talking.

59:07.097 --> 59:08.499
Okay. Got it.

59:23.747 --> 59:24.615
You ready?

59:31.088 --> 59:32.489
Yeah?

59:37.461 --> 59:38.629
Hey, Frank.

59:38.762 --> 59:40.297
What's
she doing here?

59:40.430 --> 59:44.268
I don't want her
in my house.

59:46.103 --> 59:47.271
She's
on our side.

59:47.404 --> 59:49.273
She wants to help.

59:55.145 --> 59:56.280
So, you're
telling me you're okay

59:56.413 --> 59:58.181
with whatever
happens out there.

59:58.315 --> 01:00:01.585
No. I just don't
want to be involved.

01:00:01.718 --> 01:00:05.188
I don't want that
part of my life. Okay?

01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:08.792
What if Natalie were
stopped there?

01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:11.128
She's not!

01:00:11.261 --> 01:00:13.330
Go on out there.
I need your boat.

01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:52.769
Natalie's 15
in that one.

01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:57.075
She was such a good girl.

01:00:57.207 --> 01:00:58.609
Smart.

01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:01.612
Independently minded.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.283
But that was before all
the trouble started.

01:01:09.453 --> 01:01:12.090
And then that witch
filled her head

01:01:12.222 --> 01:01:15.626
with all these... ideas.

01:01:18.362 --> 01:01:20.931
You want to help your
child, but at some point,

01:01:21.065 --> 01:01:24.334
you got to accept that
maybe you're not able to.

01:01:29.539 --> 01:01:31.141
It's not your fault.

01:01:54.065 --> 01:01:55.465
I'm going to take a shower.

01:01:58.402 --> 01:01:59.469
Uh-huh.

01:02:10.213 --> 01:02:11.648
Are you alright?

01:02:12.916 --> 01:02:15.619
Yeah. It's just...

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:18.388
You're wasting water.

01:03:37.868 --> 01:03:39.203
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?

01:03:39.336 --> 01:03:40.804
Frank, I tried.
She won't...

01:03:40.937 --> 01:03:42.906
What did she say?
I'm coming out.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.208
No. Don't do that.

01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:45.842
Stay there. It'll
only make it worse.

01:03:45.977 --> 01:03:47.511
- I can handle it.
- You're making it worse.

01:03:47.644 --> 01:03:48.980
- Would you just listen to me?
- What?

01:03:49.113 --> 01:03:51.515
Okay. There's
this other woman here.

01:03:51.648 --> 01:03:53.784
Uh-huh.
- Her name is Aurora DeLuce.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.485
- Okay.
- And she has an aunt

01:03:55.619 --> 01:03:57.621
named Caroline
who lives in the city.

01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:59.689
Now, I think that if
we just could reach out...

01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:01.092
Tom?

01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:02.626
What are you doing?

01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:05.362
Nothing.

01:04:06.197 --> 01:04:07.898
Who was that?

01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:09.833
My dad?

01:04:09.967 --> 01:04:12.335
He's just
worried about you.

01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:13.937
I'm a grown woman, Tom.

01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:17.908
But you're still
his daughter.

01:04:18.909 --> 01:04:20.310
He loves you.

01:04:22.146 --> 01:04:23.947
Do you love me?

01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:25.482
Of course.

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:29.920
Then quit living
in denial.

01:04:32.489 --> 01:04:35.193
Nat. Hey, wait.

01:04:35.325 --> 01:04:36.994
Hey, come on.
Hold up a second.

01:04:37.128 --> 01:04:38.695
Natalie!

01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:40.031
Listen to me for
a second.

01:04:40.164 --> 01:04:42.766
Just don't tell anyone.
Come on. Please.

01:04:44.268 --> 01:04:45.669
Natalie!

01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:49.606
How are you?

01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:53.244
Why is everyone so concerned
with how I'm doing?

01:04:53.376 --> 01:04:55.679
Last night
was really intense.

01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:57.315
They were speaking
through me.

01:04:57.447 --> 01:04:59.317
Sorry if that
scared you.

01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:08.825
Natalie!

01:05:10.161 --> 01:05:11.561
Natalie.

01:05:14.165 --> 01:05:15.899
Okay. Look.

01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:19.469
Tom may seem
all cool and cynical.

01:05:19.603 --> 01:05:21.504
It's all an act.

01:05:21.638 --> 01:05:22.939
He was with me
that night,

01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:24.608
when I was abducted.

01:05:24.741 --> 01:05:26.877
You were abducted?

01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:29.412
Yeah, of course.
That's how we met.

01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:33.617
Tom came back with me.

01:05:35.418 --> 01:05:37.687
At first,
it was exciting.

01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:40.390
It was our
own little secret.

01:05:40.523 --> 01:05:42.360
But I didn't want
to live that way, so...

01:05:42.492 --> 01:05:44.228
I don't understand.

01:05:44.362 --> 01:05:46.730
Yeah. My dad didn't, either.

01:05:46.863 --> 01:05:51.168
He thought I was having some
kind of psychotic episode.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:52.702
Everyone did.

01:05:53.803 --> 01:05:55.672
Until I met Elyse.

01:05:56.473 --> 01:05:58.376
Aurora!

01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:01.578
There you are! I was
looking for you.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:06.150
Soledad told me your
flower blossomed.

01:06:06.284 --> 01:06:07.851
Hmm.

01:06:07.985 --> 01:06:11.554
Aurora was just asking me
questions about my encounter.

01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:14.091
And did you answer?

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:16.793
I'm pretty sure
I did. Right?

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:19.096
Well...

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.234
Tonight, eight o'clock.

01:06:24.567 --> 01:06:25.970
Bring the flower.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.161
Hey.

01:06:51.928 --> 01:06:55.132
I, uh, I saw you
talking to Natalie.

01:06:56.367 --> 01:06:57.901
What did she say?

01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:04.741
She's ready for you.

01:07:08.346 --> 01:07:10.814
Hey, no. I need your help.

01:07:10.947 --> 01:07:11.815
Please.

01:07:34.838 --> 01:07:36.240
Thank you, Dieter.

01:07:38.942 --> 01:07:40.810
Come!

01:07:40.944 --> 01:07:43.147
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:07:44.714 --> 01:07:48.085
You know, it does
not respond to everyone.

01:07:49.519 --> 01:07:52.722
I wish everyone had
your faith.

01:07:54.492 --> 01:07:56.693
Like Tom, for example.

01:07:57.995 --> 01:07:59.363
Despite what he says,

01:07:59.497 --> 01:08:01.765
Tom is here for
a reason, Ro.

01:08:01.898 --> 01:08:03.767
And it's not because
he loves his wife

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.270
or whatever he told you.

01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:09.473
It's because deep inside,

01:08:09.606 --> 01:08:11.841
he knows the truth.

01:08:11.976 --> 01:08:15.046
And one day, he
will reveal that to you.

01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:20.783
This flower
has been used

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:24.488
by shamans in the Amazon basin
for a millennium.

01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:27.124
They were the first
one to connect

01:08:27.258 --> 01:08:30.727
the direct link
between the Pachamama,

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.263
Mother Earth,

01:08:32.395 --> 01:08:34.265
and the cosmos

01:08:34.398 --> 01:08:36.200
through their
experience with plants.

01:08:37.368 --> 01:08:40.237
It's literally a step
of inner vision.

01:08:41.238 --> 01:08:42.671
Please.

01:08:43.673 --> 01:08:45.242
I won't lie
to you, my bird.

01:08:45.376 --> 01:08:46.510
It tastes awful.

01:08:46.643 --> 01:08:48.312
But it worth the effort.

01:08:55.419 --> 01:08:56.819
Try another one.

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:09.732
You will start feeling the
vibration almost immediately.

01:09:12.203 --> 01:09:14.138
Yes.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:15.671
Don't fight it.

01:09:16.474 --> 01:09:17.874
It's nice.

01:09:19.843 --> 01:09:22.912
Let it wash over you.

01:09:23.712 --> 01:09:25.849
Whenever you're ready,

01:09:25.983 --> 01:09:28.051
open your mind.

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:42.133
Let yourself go.

01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:55.146
Now, come to me, Aurora.

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.017
Come.

01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:08.325
Aurora.

01:10:09.593 --> 01:10:11.861
Aurora?

01:10:13.597 --> 01:10:14.465
Come.

01:10:27.244 --> 01:10:29.113
Aurora!

01:10:37.921 --> 01:10:41.125
Come to me! Aurora!

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.362
Aurora!

01:10:46.763 --> 01:10:48.966
Don't worry!

01:10:49.832 --> 01:10:51.168
It's okay!

01:10:51.302 --> 01:10:53.304
Don't be afraid!

01:10:56.373 --> 01:10:58.708
It's time for you
to face this night.

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:02.146
Don't be scared. Look.

01:11:03.147 --> 01:11:04.014
Look.

01:11:38.649 --> 01:11:40.050
Come on.

01:11:44.388 --> 01:11:45.788
Ready to go.

01:11:49.627 --> 01:11:51.028
Aurora...

01:11:53.763 --> 01:11:54.632
I just want to say...

01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:14.418
You sure you know what
you're doing?

01:12:30.467 --> 01:12:31.535
Goodbye, Frank.

01:13:05.569 --> 01:13:07.071
Welcome.

01:13:07.204 --> 01:13:09.406
It's good to see you.

01:13:10.674 --> 01:13:12.710
Everyone, look who's here.

01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:48.612
- It was beautiful.
- Elyse! Elyse!

01:13:48.746 --> 01:13:49.613
What's
going on?

01:13:49.747 --> 01:13:50.614
There's someone here.

01:13:50.748 --> 01:13:51.881
What?

01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:57.488
There's someone here.

01:13:59.623 --> 01:14:01.291
Everybody stay inside.

01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:02.359
Dieter.

01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:03.427
Yes.

01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:09.566
Okay.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.069
You know the protocols.

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.537
Go to your rooms.

01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:15.672
Now. Now!

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.442
Natalie!

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:22.146
Natalie!

01:14:22.279 --> 01:14:24.581
Natalie, what is
going on?

01:14:24.715 --> 01:14:26.116
Is everything okay?

01:14:28.318 --> 01:14:29.453
Oh, my God. Ro.

01:14:29.586 --> 01:14:30.454
Caroline?

01:14:30.587 --> 01:14:32.856
Natalie.

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.458
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:34.591 --> 01:14:36.727
I'm here to
take you home.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.061
I am home.

01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:39.396
Ro,
what's going on?

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:41.765
Do you know anything
about this woman?

01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:44.268
Did she tell you she was
in the same ward as Natalie?

01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:46.737
I was sent
to find your daughter.

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.172
Delusions of grandeur.

01:14:48.305 --> 01:14:49.406
That's what they call it.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.842
Her real name is
Rose Alba Salazar.

01:14:51.975 --> 01:14:54.778
She was a registered nurse
in goddamn Guadalajara

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:55.979
before she lost
her fucking mind.

01:14:56.113 --> 01:14:59.016
Lies. All of it.

01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:01.285
I can show you
the patients' list

01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:02.686
from the hospital
if you want.

01:15:04.655 --> 01:15:05.989
It's true, Ro.

01:15:06.123 --> 01:15:07.191
I've seen it.

01:15:07.324 --> 01:15:08.792
Come on. Enough
is enough.

01:15:08.926 --> 01:15:09.793
- Come on, honey.
- Hey.

01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:10.994
- Come on.
- Hey.

01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:13.130
No. I'm not going anywhere.

01:15:14.131 --> 01:15:16.700
Natalie.
Natalie, wait.

01:15:16.834 --> 01:15:17.901
Natalie, please, honey!

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:21.205
- Natalie!
- Leave us alone.

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:23.640
Frank.

01:15:25.976 --> 01:15:28.011
Fucking crazy bitch.

01:15:28.145 --> 01:15:29.546
Come on.

01:15:33.217 --> 01:15:34.618
Natalie!

01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:39.022
Natalie.

01:15:40.023 --> 01:15:41.425
Natalie, are you okay?

01:15:42.926 --> 01:15:44.828
Oh...

01:15:44.963 --> 01:15:46.129
Did you see that?

01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:48.799
Yeah. I think
you should lie down.

01:15:48.932 --> 01:15:50.734
It's happening, Ro.

01:15:50.868 --> 01:15:53.070
It's really happening.

01:15:55.974 --> 01:15:58.008
Oh, my God.

01:15:58.141 --> 01:16:01.345
Oh, my God.
It is so beautiful.

01:16:01.478 --> 01:16:02.981
Help!

01:16:03.113 --> 01:16:04.348
- They're speaking.
- Help!

01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:05.582
- What's going on?
- Help!

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:08.318
- Elyse.
- What's going on?

01:16:08.452 --> 01:16:09.720
Elyse, there's
something wrong!

01:16:09.853 --> 01:16:12.789
Calm down.

01:16:14.124 --> 01:16:15.058
Let me get her up.

01:16:15.192 --> 01:16:16.527
Let's go inside.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.728
Dieter!

01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:19.062
Watch out, my birdy.

01:16:19.196 --> 01:16:20.564
Take care. Okay.

01:16:20.697 --> 01:16:22.366
She's arriving.

01:16:22.499 --> 01:16:24.067
- Take her, please...
- Where's Tom?

01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:25.869
To my room.

01:16:26.004 --> 01:16:28.205
Go. Go.

01:16:29.139 --> 01:16:30.440
Lay her down, Dieter.

01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:33.143
I really don't
understand.

01:16:33.277 --> 01:16:34.979
This was not supposed to
happen like this.

01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:36.179
They're
coming back soon.

01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:37.614
Hey, hey, hey. Yes.

01:16:37.748 --> 01:16:39.750
Why did you turn her
father away like that?

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:42.653
He wants to put
her back in that cage,

01:16:42.786 --> 01:16:45.389
and she belongs
here with me.

01:16:45.522 --> 01:16:47.658
- She's sick! She needs help!
- She is not sick.

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:50.861
She's arriving. Hand
me the flower, please.

01:17:01.505 --> 01:17:02.706
Okay.

01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:05.442
Stop!

01:17:05.576 --> 01:17:07.377
Elyse says no
one leaves!

01:17:28.699 --> 01:17:29.700
Shh, shh, shh.

01:17:29.833 --> 01:17:31.234
There's something
wrong with Natalie.

01:17:31.368 --> 01:17:32.736
I know. Frank and
Caroline are waiting.

01:17:32.869 --> 01:17:34.404
Come on.

01:18:12.376 --> 01:18:13.477
Police are on their way.

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.479
We have to go now.

01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:17.447
Left her
with that monster.

01:18:17.581 --> 01:18:18.849
Someone's coming. Shh.

01:18:18.983 --> 01:18:21.019
- Where's Tom?
- Shh, shh. Down.

01:18:44.574 --> 01:18:48.146
Tonight at 6:43pm,

01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:50.914
in a moment of
divine revelation,

01:18:51.049 --> 01:18:53.884
Natalie arrived

01:18:54.018 --> 01:18:56.319
at the hour of
her dawn.

01:18:56.453 --> 01:18:59.756
Her father won't
understand,

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:01.892
but Tom does.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.729
Despite his betrayal.

01:19:05.862 --> 01:19:07.531
And his betrayal

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:10.267
will bring him
back to me,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.602
and in doing so...

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:19.643
I will be killed.

01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:25.016
But have faith,

01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:27.350
because I
will return...

01:19:28.618 --> 01:19:32.456
On the fourth moon of
our lunar...

01:19:35.258 --> 01:19:37.260
Our cosmic dawn.

01:19:38.062 --> 01:19:39.362
So, now, I leave you

01:19:39.496 --> 01:19:42.399
with a reading from
the book of Penumbra.

01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:43.968
No, no, no, no.

01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:21.105
Aurora!

01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:23.040
Mizuki! Mizuki!

01:20:23.174 --> 01:20:24.242
Aurora!

01:20:24.374 --> 01:20:26.309
Stop!

01:20:29.312 --> 01:20:31.381
On parting,

01:20:31.515 --> 01:20:33.017
I say to you...

01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:35.385
No! No!

01:20:44.061 --> 01:20:46.396
May we reach
the dawn.

01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:49.332
No!

01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:53.670
Be okay. Be okay.

01:20:53.804 --> 01:20:55.273
Be okay.

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:02.779
Somebody help!

01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:05.916
Oh.

01:21:12.322 --> 01:21:13.723
Natalie.

01:21:14.758 --> 01:21:15.960
Natalie!

01:21:20.298 --> 01:21:22.133
You, you killed her.

01:21:22.266 --> 01:21:23.134
Stop.

01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:18.855
Natalie.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.176
I was wrong
about one thing, Tom.

01:22:42.646 --> 01:22:44.814
Natalie was
never the Zena.

01:22:47.018 --> 01:22:49.452
Put it down,
you slimy fuck.

01:22:52.256 --> 01:22:54.191
Put
it down, Dieter.

01:22:54.325 --> 01:22:55.725
It's okay.

01:22:57.128 --> 01:22:58.528
Go.

01:23:00.463 --> 01:23:02.832
Natalie? Nat?

01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:06.469
Sweetie.

01:23:06.603 --> 01:23:08.805
She's not gone.
She reached...

01:23:08.939 --> 01:23:10.007
Ah!

01:24:37.161 --> 01:24:38.561
Where are they?

01:24:39.796 --> 01:24:41.999
They are waiting
for you.

01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:45.762
I knew
you would come.

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:49.866
No, no. This
can't be real.

01:25:54.472 --> 01:25:56.673
It was always you.

01:25:58.775 --> 01:26:01.345
I just didn't
realize it at first.

01:26:16.527 --> 01:26:19.063
Sorry. It was the
only way.

01:26:21.465 --> 01:26:23.267
No, no.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.602
No.

01:26:24.734 --> 01:26:26.636
No. Th... this
is a dream.

01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:32.309
The world is full of
illusions, Ro.

01:26:35.613 --> 01:26:37.814
But the dawn
is real.

01:26:41.018 --> 01:26:43.554
You are the one
they chose.

01:31:03.814 --> 01:31:05.182
Hello?

01:31:08.318 --> 01:31:09.820
Honey? Honey? Ro, honey?

01:31:11.889 --> 01:31:13.290
Ro, honey?

01:31:18.962 --> 01:31:20.030
Mom?

01:31:29.106 --> 01:31:30.374
Mom?

01:31:30.507 --> 01:31:31.642
I see you.

01:32:15.786 --> 01:32:18.589
Do you know
how much I love you?
