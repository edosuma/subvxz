<c.speaker>Are you Quita Moz?

01:06.250 --> 01:08.375
<c.speaker>You see things
in the fire?

01:08.375 --> 01:11.583
<c.speaker>The past, the present,
the future.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.708
<c.speaker>[Mateo] My grandfather
wanted to make sure

01:13.708 --> 01:16.208
<c.speaker>the Scepter of Night
didn't fall
into the wrong hands.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.208
<c.speaker>So, he broke it
into three pieces.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.583
<c.speaker><i>We got it! </i>

01:20.583 --> 01:23.291
<c.speaker><i>The first piece of the scepter! </i>

01:23.291 --> 01:25.958
<c.speaker>Fortunately,
I heard the riddle

01:25.958 --> 01:27.833
<c.speaker><i>that leads to the next piece. </i>

01:27.833 --> 01:30.750
<c.speaker>So, who's ready to solve
the second riddle?

01:33.083 --> 01:35.458
<c.speaker>[Elena reading]

01:35.458 --> 01:37.000
<c.speakerTop>[Mateo]
"In the valley of stars,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.250
<c.speakerTop>find the sun
that sparkles
inside the moon.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.375
<c.speakerTop>Guess we all better put on
our riddle caps.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.833
<c.speakerTop>We have to find the next piece
before Shuriki.

01:44.833 --> 01:48.000
<c.speakerTop>Don't worry. I am a wiz
at cracking riddles.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.375
<c.speakerTop>You mean jokes.
[laughs]

01:50.375 --> 01:52.583
<c.speaker>How is it possible
for one kid

01:52.583 --> 01:54.708
<c.speaker>to get this much
dirt on her face?

01:54.708 --> 01:57.958
<c.speaker>-[horses whinny]
-[gasps] I think
they're home!

01:57.958 --> 02:00.583
<c.speaker><i>Mama! Papa! </i>

02:05.250 --> 02:07.833
<c.speaker>-[gasps]
-[Naomi] <i>Elena? </i>

02:07.833 --> 02:10.416
<c.speaker>-What do you think?
-About what?

02:10.416 --> 02:13.291
<c.speaker>The riddle we're trying
to solve, remember?

02:13.291 --> 02:14.416
<c.speaker>[sighs]
I'm sorry.

02:14.416 --> 02:15.958
<c.speaker>Seeing Shuriki again

02:15.958 --> 02:18.458
<c.speaker>reminded me
of my parents.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.166
<c.speaker>We have to stop her.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.333
<c.speaker>And we will.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.291
<c.speaker>But first we have
to solve that riddle.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.083
<c.speaker>Right, of course.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.375
<c.speaker>What was it again?

02:26.375 --> 02:28.375
<c.speaker>"In the valley
of stars,

02:28.375 --> 02:31.458
<c.speaker>find the sun
that sparkles
in the moon"?

02:31.458 --> 02:32.416
<c.speaker>I got it!

02:32.416 --> 02:34.416
<c.speaker>We have to go
to the moon.

02:34.416 --> 02:35.625
<c.speaker>No, Skylar.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.291
<c.speaker>We have to go
to Vallestrella.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.833
<c.speaker>Valley of the stars.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.000
<c.speaker>That's what
"Vallestrella" means.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-Great!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.750
<c.speaker>To the realm
of the jaquins!

02:44.750 --> 02:46.250
<c.speaker>Wings up, <i>amigos! </i>

02:46.250 --> 02:47.625
<c.speaker>Ah, ah, ah!
Right after

02:47.625 --> 02:49.833
<c.speaker>we lock this up
in the palace treasury.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.416
<c.speaker>There's no time
for that.

02:51.416 --> 02:52.333
<c.speaker>Tell him, Gabe.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.458
<c.speaker>Actually,
I agree with Mateo.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.333
<c.speaker>-What?
-We need to secure it
immediately.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.333
<c.speaker>[Naomi]
No, we don't!

02:57.333 --> 02:59.458
<c.speaker>Wings down, <i>amigos. </i>

02:59.458 --> 03:01.416
<c.speaker>Beyond a doubt,
Shuriki,

03:01.416 --> 03:04.000
<c.speaker>we will find
the next piece
of the scepter

03:04.000 --> 03:06.750
<c.speaker>-in Vallestrella.
-Excellent!

03:06.750 --> 03:08.458
<c.speaker>Ah, but since
the jaquins

03:08.458 --> 03:10.500
<c.speaker>do not like humans
in their realm,

03:10.500 --> 03:12.458
<c.speaker>we will need
to be prepared.

03:12.458 --> 03:16.416
<c.speaker>So, it is time
you made us <i>malvagos. </i>

03:16.416 --> 03:18.375
<c.speaker>How many times
must I tell you

03:18.375 --> 03:21.708
<c.speaker>I cannot make you
into <i>malvagos  </i>
without a wand?

03:21.708 --> 03:23.000
<c.speaker>But Fiero can...

03:23.000 --> 03:24.500
<c.speaker>with his <i>tamborita. </i>

03:24.500 --> 03:26.125
<c.speaker>[Fiero laughing]

03:26.125 --> 03:29.291
<c.speaker>You are not ready
to become dark wizards.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.208
<c.speaker>Yes, we are.
We have learned

03:31.208 --> 03:32.875
<c.speaker>all the spells
in this spell book.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.833
<c.speaker>And made our own
<i>tamboritas. </i>

03:34.833 --> 03:37.250
<c.speaker>-[grunts]
-What was that?

03:37.250 --> 03:40.375
<c.speaker>-A self-destruct spell?
-Enough!

03:40.375 --> 03:42.708
<c.speaker>Can't you see we have
bigger problems at hand?

03:42.708 --> 03:45.500
<c.speaker>How are we going
to enter Vallestrella?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.125
<c.speaker>That is a good question.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.083
<c.speaker>Only jaquins can open
the gateway.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.583
<c.speaker>Ugh! Are you telling me
I must ride

03:51.583 --> 03:53.458
<c.speaker>one of those
disgusting creatures?

03:53.458 --> 03:55.000
<c.speaker>Only if we are
lucky enough

03:55.000 --> 03:57.125
<c.speaker>to find one
willing to take us.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.875
<c.speaker>We do not
need luck.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.208
<c.speaker>There's an outlaw
I met during our travels

04:01.208 --> 04:02.750
<c.speaker>who is quite resourceful.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.583
<c.speaker>Then takes us
to him, Victor.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.416
<c.speaker>We have no time
to waste.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.583
<c.speaker>Follow me!

04:08.583 --> 04:10.291
<c.speaker>[grunts angrily]

04:10.291 --> 04:11.958
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
If the staff is locked up,

04:11.958 --> 04:14.458
<c.speaker>Shuriki won't be able
to make the Scepter of Night

04:14.458 --> 04:16.958
<c.speaker>even if she finds
the other two pieces.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.000
<c.speaker>Wings up!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.416
<c.speaker>But going
to Vallestrella

04:19.416 --> 04:21.708
<c.speaker>is our best chance
to catch Shuriki.

04:21.708 --> 04:22.958
<c.speaker>Wings down.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.166
<c.speaker>We should split up.
Gabe and Mateo,

04:25.166 --> 04:26.583
<c.speaker>take the staff
to the palace.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.083
<c.speaker>Naomi and I will
go to Vallestrella

04:28.083 --> 04:29.625
<c.speaker>to find the next piece
of the scepter

04:29.625 --> 04:31.458
<c.speaker>and take care of Shuriki.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.166
<c.speaker>As soon as we
get the staff

04:33.166 --> 04:35.083
<c.speaker>back to the palace,
we'll come find you.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.458
<c.speaker>[Victor] Just through
those trees... ooh!

04:41.458 --> 04:43.583
<c.speaker>...there's a hidden den.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.000
<c.speakerTop>That's where
the outlaw,
Troyo, lives.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.458
<c.speakerTop>Princess Elena tried
to expel him from Avalor,

04:48.458 --> 04:51.000
<c.speaker>but he snuck back in.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.416
<c.speaker>[Carla] It's the
royal wizard, "Matato."

04:56.000 --> 04:57.291
<c.speaker>He has the staff!

04:57.291 --> 04:58.625
<c.speaker>But where is Elena?

04:58.625 --> 04:59.875
<c.speaker>She must already
be on her way

04:59.875 --> 05:01.875
<c.speaker>to Vallestrella
for the scepter piece

05:01.875 --> 05:03.958
<c.speaker>while we are wandering
in the jungle.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.583
<c.speaker>Actually, this is
wonderful news, Fiero.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.958
<c.speaker>She's not there
to protect them.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.458
<c.speaker>You two, go get
the scepter staff.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.833
<c.speaker>But they're
on jaquins!

05:12.833 --> 05:14.500
<c.speaker>We'll never
catch up to them.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.458
<c.speaker>Unless we were <i>malvagos. </i>

05:17.458 --> 05:19.500
<c.speaker>Then we could use
a magic spell.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.333
<c.speaker>Carla is right, Shuriki.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.875
<c.speaker>Hmmph.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.458
<c.speaker>All right, then.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.875
<c.speaker>Fiero,
make them <i>malvagos. </i>

05:27.875 --> 05:30.083
<c.speaker>Ugh! You cannot
possibly think

05:30.083 --> 05:32.083
<c.speaker>these two
can handle
the power.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.416
<c.speaker>We shall find out
soon enough.

05:34.416 --> 05:35.625
<c.speaker>Do it!

05:35.625 --> 05:37.333
<c.speaker>[squeals] Finally!

05:38.416 --> 05:39.416
<c.speaker>Hmmph.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.083
<c.speaker><i>En cualani </i>
<i>en malvago. </i>

05:44.083 --> 05:46.500
<c.speaker><i>En acualli </i>
<i>en malvago! </i>

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
<c.speaker><i>En catzacti </i>
<i>en malvago! </i>

05:50.833 --> 05:53.250
<c.speaker>[Carla chuckles]

05:53.250 --> 05:55.083
<c.speaker>Do you feel it, <i>Papa? </i>

05:55.083 --> 05:56.750
<c.speaker>[evil laughter]

05:56.750 --> 05:58.291
<c.speaker>Yes!

05:58.291 --> 06:00.125
<c.speaker>[Victor laughing]

06:00.125 --> 06:04.208
<c.speaker>I feel the magic
coursing through my veins.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.333
<c.speaker>If only <i>Mama  </i>
could see us now.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.708
<c.speaker>You will not regret this.

06:17.708 --> 06:18.708
<c.speaker>Come along, Carla.

06:18.708 --> 06:19.875
<c.speaker>[Victor] I will cast

06:19.875 --> 06:21.708
<c.speaker>a speed spell
on the horses.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.250
<c.speaker>Oh! I know that spell.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.375
<c.speaker><i>Hualoa! </i>

06:24.375 --> 06:26.125
<c.speaker>-[horses whinny]
-[Carla shrieks]

06:26.125 --> 06:27.583
<c.speaker>-[both screaming]
-[Carla] What's happening?

06:27.583 --> 06:29.875
<c.speaker>[Victor]
You said the wrong spell!

06:29.875 --> 06:33.166
<c.speaker>[groans]
I regret this already.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.166
<c.speaker><i>Mualoa! </i>

06:37.583 --> 06:40.583
<c.speaker>Now, let us
meet this Troyo.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.166
<c.speaker>[Luna]
Open, "says me."

06:55.708 --> 06:57.458
<c.speaker>[Naomi] Whoa!

07:00.375 --> 07:01.583
<c.speaker>[Butterfrog ribbits]

07:01.583 --> 07:03.583
<c.speaker>Was that a frog
or a butterfly?

07:03.583 --> 07:04.583
<c.speakerTop>Yup!

07:04.583 --> 07:06.708
<c.speaker>So, now we have
to find a sun

07:06.708 --> 07:08.375
<c.speaker>that sparkles
in the moon.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.583
<c.speaker>What does that even mean?

07:10.583 --> 07:14.625
<c.speaker>I don't know, but I have
some friends who might.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.625
<c.speaker>[horse whinnies]

07:25.291 --> 07:26.291
<c.speaker>[both gasp]

07:26.291 --> 07:27.958
<c.speaker>[gasps] No!

07:27.958 --> 07:30.208
<c.speaker>-No!
-It's okay, Elena.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.375
<c.speaker>[Skylar]
They're just flaringos.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.875
<c.speaker>These are the friends
I told you about.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.458
<c.speaker>[sighs] I'm sorry.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.833
<c.speaker>I just can't get Shuriki
out of my head.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.500
<c.speaker>-Hey, Zuni.
-Oh, hey, Skylar.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.875
<c.speaker>This is <i>Princesa </i>Elena--
she needs your help.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.000
<c.speaker>I have to solve
a very important riddle.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.375
<c.speaker>"In the valley of stars,
find the sun

07:48.375 --> 07:49.458
<c.speaker>that sparkles in the moon."

07:49.458 --> 07:51.875
<c.speaker>Whoa, there!
Slow down.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.583
<c.speaker>I can't. I have to prevent
an evil sorceress

07:54.583 --> 07:56.583
<c.speaker>from finding
this powerful weapon.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.416
<c.speaker>Bad mood alert.
Bad mood alert!

07:59.416 --> 08:01.833
<c.speaker>Yeah, you gotta
chill out!

08:01.833 --> 08:03.583
<c.speaker>Make today
a happy day.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.583
<c.speaker>[chuckles] Every day
is a happy day, Zuni.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.583
<c.speaker>Good point, Lomo.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.000
<c.speaker>So, can you help us or not?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.583
<c.speaker>Oh, yes.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.333
<c.speaker>First you must let go

08:13.333 --> 08:15.500
<c.speaker>of all of your
dark feelings.

08:15.500 --> 08:20.333
<c.speaker>Imagine them blowing away
like leaves in the wind.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.875
<c.speaker>[imitates wind blowing]

08:25.291 --> 08:28.375
<c.speaker>Um, she means
with the riddle, Maya.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.583
<c.speaker>We know where the sun
sparkles in the moon.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.000
<c.speaker>We can take you there.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.708
<c.speaker>Great! Let's go.

08:34.708 --> 08:37.625
<c.speaker>Ha! Adventure,
here we come!

08:37.625 --> 08:39.708
<c.speaker>Let's walk off
that bad mood!

08:52.083 --> 08:54.208
<c.speaker>I don't see any den.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.416
<c.speaker>It looks like
Victor was wrong.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.458
<c.speaker>No surprise there.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.708
<c.speaker>I say we turn back.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.458
<c.speaker>[Troyo]
Looking for Troyo?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.583
<c.speaker>I hear that he's
a handsome rapscallion.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.416
<c.speaker>King of the jungle--
more or less.

09:05.416 --> 09:06.708
<c.speaker>Fast as a flash
of lightning!

09:06.708 --> 09:08.458
<c.speaker>[Shuriki gasps]

09:08.458 --> 09:09.875
<c.speaker>We all get that
I'm Troyo, right?

09:09.875 --> 09:10.875
<c.speaker>[scoffs]

09:10.875 --> 09:12.833
<c.speaker>We need a jaquin

09:12.833 --> 09:14.750
<c.speaker>to get us into Vallestrella.

09:14.750 --> 09:18.166
<c.speaker>Troyo can make that happen...
for a price.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.708
<c.speaker>How about this?

09:20.708 --> 09:22.958
<c.speaker>If you get me a jaquin,

09:22.958 --> 09:24.708
<c.speaker>when I take over Avalor,

09:24.708 --> 09:27.708
<c.speaker>I will make you
the real king
of the jungle.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.583
<c.speaker>You just got yourself
a jaquin.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.375
<c.speaker>Hey, I'll even throw in
a second one...

09:34.375 --> 09:37.291
<c.speaker>at no extra charge.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.833
<c.speaker>I gave these jaquins
a place to hide out.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.875
<c.speaker>So, now they owe me.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.875
<c.speaker>This is Cruz,

09:42.875 --> 09:46.208
<c.speaker>and his twin sister,
Vestia.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.833
<c.speaker>Evil twin.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.958
<c.speaker>All you did was
break me out of jail.

09:49.958 --> 09:50.875
<c.speaker>I'm eviler.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.750
<c.speaker>I like these two
already.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.583
<c.speaker>[Elena] We've been
walking a while.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.083
<c.speaker>How much further is it?

10:00.083 --> 10:02.291
<c.speaker>I know the scenic route
takes longer,

10:02.291 --> 10:04.708
<c.speaker>but it is totally worth it!

10:04.708 --> 10:06.375
<c.speaker>Scenic route?

10:06.375 --> 10:08.708
<c.speaker>But we need to get there
before that sorceress.

10:08.708 --> 10:12.000
<c.speaker>Life is about the journey,
not the destination.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.583
<c.speaker>Nope. It's pretty much about
the destination right now.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.583
<c.speaker>You have no idea
what she did to my family.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.458
<c.speaker>Whatever she did,

10:21.458 --> 10:22.833
<c.speaker>if you keep peering

10:22.833 --> 10:25.083
<c.speaker>into the darkness
of your past,

10:25.083 --> 10:29.500
<c.speaker>you'll never see
a brighter future.

Yeah, that was good.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.125

Here we are.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.000
<c.speaker>The sun inside the moon!

12:36.000 --> 12:38.083
<c.speaker>That must be
the scepter piece.

12:38.083 --> 12:41.000
<c.speaker>Don't forget
to enjoy the ride.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.583

12:45.458 --> 12:46.458
<c.speaker>Oof!

12:46.458 --> 12:48.458
<c.speaker>I had to ask.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.875
<c.speaker>It's down there
pretty deep.

12:51.875 --> 12:54.625
<c.speaker>Well, how long can you
hold your breath underwater?

12:54.625 --> 12:56.458
<c.speaker>[sighs]
Not long enough
to reach it.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.875
<c.speakerTop>-[Butterfrog] Hey!
-[Elena] What?!

12:57.875 --> 13:00.375
<c.speaker>You're blocking my sun!

13:00.375 --> 13:02.583
<c.speakerTop>Uh... Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

13:02.583 --> 13:06.208
<c.speakerTop>Um, you see that sparkly thing
at the bottom of the pond?

13:06.208 --> 13:10.208
<c.speaker>The only thing I see is you
still blocking my sun!

13:10.208 --> 13:13.375
<c.speaker>Right. Uh, sorry.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.458
<c.speaker>I don't suppose
there's any way

13:15.458 --> 13:17.125
<c.speaker>you could dive down and get
that sparkly thing for us?

13:17.125 --> 13:18.416
<c.speaker>[chuckles nervously]

13:18.416 --> 13:21.583
<c.speaker>I'm kinda busy.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.000
<c.speaker>Would you look at that!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.583
<c.speaker>It's a total "Luna" eclipse.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.833
<c.speaker>So, that's how
you're gonna play it.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.208
<c.speaker>It's already been
played, Butterfrog.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.708
<c.speaker>Ugh!

13:34.958 --> 13:36.416
<c.speaker>[sighs]

13:41.458 --> 13:43.500
<c.speaker>[spits] There.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.166
<c.speaker>Now will you get
out of my sun?

13:45.166 --> 13:47.083
<c.speaker>Right after we find
the next riddle.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.291
<c.speaker>[Butterfrog]
Ugh!

13:48.291 --> 13:50.083
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

13:50.083 --> 13:51.625
<c.speaker>[Naomi]
Ooh! Down there!

13:51.625 --> 13:54.083
<c.speaker>[Elena] "When you reach
the highest of heights,

13:54.083 --> 13:57.875
<c.speaker>the jewel of night will be
in the clasp of your claw."

13:57.875 --> 13:59.125
<c.speaker>Oh! I know this one!

13:59.125 --> 14:00.458
<c.speaker>It's not the moon.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.000
<c.speaker>I don't know this one.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.083
<c.speaker>"The highest of heights."

14:04.083 --> 14:06.250
<c.speaker>Oh! What's the tallest
mountain in Vallestrella?

14:06.250 --> 14:08.125
<c.speaker><i>Monte Grande Garra. </i>

14:08.125 --> 14:09.708
<c.speaker>Oh! Oh!
And at the very top

14:09.708 --> 14:12.375
<c.speaker>it's got a rock formation
that looks like a jaquin claw.

14:12.375 --> 14:16.000
<c.speaker>"The jewel of night will be
in the clasp of your claw."

14:16.000 --> 14:18.416
<c.speaker>That's where the third
scepter piece is.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.125
<c.speaker>Naomi, hold on to this.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.166
<c.speaker>Ahh, finally.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.000
<c.speaker>Thanks for the help!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.583
<c.speaker>No worries!

14:25.583 --> 14:27.166
<c.speaker>Where are you headed now?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.000
<c.speaker><i>Monte Grande Garra! </i>

14:29.000 --> 14:32.458
<c.speaker>Don't forget
to keep on movin' on!

14:35.166 --> 14:38.166
<c.speaker>What an extraordinary place.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.875
<c.speaker>Uh, yeah, we probably
shouldn't linger

14:40.875 --> 14:42.291
<c.speaker>out in the open
like this.

14:42.291 --> 14:45.083
<c.speaker>My brother and I are
not exactly welcome here.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.875
<c.speaker>Then we'd better
solve the riddle quickly.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.166
<c.speaker>[Fiero] You there,
can you help us?

14:52.166 --> 14:54.166
<c.speaker>We are searching
for something
that looks like

14:54.166 --> 14:56.875
<c.speaker>a sun sparkling
inside the moon.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.333
<c.speaker>[chuckling] Whoa!

14:58.333 --> 15:00.000
<c.speaker>We just helped
some other folks

15:00.000 --> 15:02.250
<c.speaker>solve that same riddle.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.291
<c.speaker>And now they're off
on their journey

15:05.291 --> 15:07.875
<c.speaker>to <i>Monte Grande Garra, </i>

15:07.875 --> 15:09.708
<c.speaker>finding their way...

15:09.708 --> 15:12.458
<c.speaker>Elena must have
the scepter mount,

15:12.458 --> 15:14.458
<c.speaker>and now she's after the jewel.

15:14.458 --> 15:17.583
<c.speaker>Well, take us to this
<i>Monte Grande Garra. </i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.125
<c.speaker>[Zuni]
One more thing.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.333
<c.speaker>They said there's
an evil sorceress
on the loose.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.750
<c.speaker>Yeah, so whatever you do,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.458
<c.speaker>do not tell her
where they're going.

15:27.458 --> 15:30.083

17:13.000 --> 17:15.208
<c.speaker>[grunts] Blaze!

17:16.333 --> 17:18.375
<c.speaker>Look at her--
she's getting weaker

17:18.375 --> 17:19.375
<c.speaker>with each blast.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.458
<c.speaker>Yes, she is.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.208
<c.speaker>You go get
the scepter piece.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.208
<c.speaker>I will keep
the princess busy.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.416
<c.speaker>They're splitting up.

17:28.416 --> 17:29.458
<c.speaker>Who do we follow?

17:29.458 --> 17:30.458
<c.speaker>Shuriki!

17:32.875 --> 17:34.083
<c.speaker>Blaze!

17:38.000 --> 17:40.625
<c.speaker>That's it.
Keep firing.

17:44.583 --> 17:45.958
<c.speaker>Blaze!

17:51.375 --> 17:52.333
<c.speaker>Blaze.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.750
<c.speaker>-[groans]
-[gasps]

17:54.750 --> 17:56.083
<c.speaker>[Elena yelps]

17:56.083 --> 17:58.208
<c.speaker>Aah! Are you all right?

17:58.208 --> 18:00.458
<c.speaker>I'll be... fine.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.125
<c.speaker>Where is she?

18:02.125 --> 18:03.708
<c.speaker>Oh, silly girl.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.708
<c.speaker>While you were
playing chase with me,

18:05.708 --> 18:07.958
<c.speaker>you left your friend
all alone.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.583
<c.speaker>-Naomi!
-[Skylar growls]

18:09.583 --> 18:12.291
<c.speaker>I recognize that
helpless expression.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.291
<c.speaker>It's the same one
your parents had

18:14.291 --> 18:16.333
<c.speaker>before I struck them down.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.416
<c.speaker>[laughs]

18:18.416 --> 18:20.250
<c.speaker>[weakly]
We have to help...

18:20.250 --> 18:22.250
<c.speaker>[grunts, sighs]

18:22.250 --> 18:24.250
<c.speaker>[Naomi grunting]

18:24.250 --> 18:26.500
<c.speaker>[grunting]

18:26.500 --> 18:27.875
<c.speaker>It's not breaking.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.625
<c.speaker>[Fiero]
Then let me give it a try.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.125
<c.speaker><i>Boqato! </i>

18:31.125 --> 18:32.416
<c.speaker>[Naomi and Luna exclaim]

18:36.000 --> 18:37.333
<c.speaker>[laughs]

18:37.333 --> 18:39.625
<c.speaker>Hand over
the other piece!

18:39.625 --> 18:41.875
<c.speaker>Not gonna happen.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.166
<c.speaker><i>Boqato! </i>

18:43.166 --> 18:44.375
<c.speaker>-Aah!
-Aah!

18:44.375 --> 18:45.708
<c.speaker>[both grunt]

18:45.708 --> 18:47.166
<c.speaker>Run, Naomi!

18:47.166 --> 18:48.375
<c.speaker>I'll hold them off!

18:48.375 --> 18:49.583
<c.speaker>[growls]

18:57.000 --> 18:59.458
<c.speaker>-[Naomi gasps]
-Going somewhere with that?

18:59.458 --> 19:01.708
<c.speaker>-[Cruz] Not anymore.
-[Naomi whimpering]

19:03.125 --> 19:04.291
<c.speaker>[cries out, grunting]

19:04.291 --> 19:05.875
<c.speaker>Oh, why, thank you.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.416
<c.speaker>[shrieks]

19:07.416 --> 19:09.458
<c.speaker>[Shuriki laughing]

19:09.458 --> 19:11.333
<c.speaker>[Fiero]
I have the jewel!

19:11.333 --> 19:13.458
<c.speaker>I hate to leave you
hanging, but...

19:13.458 --> 19:15.416
<c.speaker>-[Shuriki laughs]
-[Naomi cries out]

19:15.416 --> 19:17.458
<c.speaker>You won't be much longer.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.458
<c.speaker>[laughs]

19:21.291 --> 19:23.875
<c.speaker>[grunting]

19:23.875 --> 19:25.500
<c.speaker>Aah!

19:31.125 --> 19:33.125
<c.speaker>-They have both pieces.
-[Elena] What?

19:33.125 --> 19:35.208
<c.speaker>I have to get them back.
[sighs, grunts]

19:35.208 --> 19:36.500
<c.speaker>You're not going anywhere.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.250
<c.speaker>Not until you rest.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.000
<c.speaker>[Luna sighs]
I'm sorry.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.333
<c.speaker>I tried to stop 'em.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.875
<c.speaker>[sighs] I should've
just stayed with you,

19:44.875 --> 19:47.166
<c.speaker>but I was so... Ugh!

19:47.166 --> 19:50.166
<c.speaker>[panting] I had
to go after her.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.458
<c.speaker>I get why
you're so mad,

19:52.458 --> 19:55.125
<c.speaker>but maybe it's like
the flaringos said.

19:55.125 --> 19:56.625
<c.speaker>If you don't let go
of your past,

19:56.625 --> 19:59.583
<c.speaker>you can really
mess up your future.

19:59.583 --> 20:03.125
<c.speaker>[sighs] You're right.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.375
<c.speaker>Look, here come
Gabe and Mateo!

20:05.375 --> 20:07.333
<c.speaker>[Luna] Well, at least
the guys locked up the staff.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.333
<c.speaker>Shuriki won't be able
to make that Scepter of Night

20:09.333 --> 20:10.625
<c.speaker>without all three pieces.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.958
<c.speaker>[Gabe sighs]
We have some bad news.

20:12.958 --> 20:14.333
<c.speaker>Victor and Carla

20:14.333 --> 20:15.708
<c.speaker>stole the scepter staff.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.750
<c.speaker>But don't panic.
As long as we have

20:17.750 --> 20:20.000
<c.speaker>the other pieces,
we're okay.

20:21.458 --> 20:24.416
<c.speaker>You have the other
pieces, right?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
<c.speaker>Scepter of Night.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.875
<c.speaker>Oh, how I have longed
for this moment.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.375
<c.speaker>Together, you and I will
take over Avalor for good.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.708
<c.speaker>[Fiero] Not so fast.

20:55.708 --> 20:59.375
<c.speaker>First I have to teach you
how to use it.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.458
<c.speaker>Then what are you waiting for?

21:06.291 --> 21:08.416
<c.speaker>Now that Shuriki has
the Scepter of Night,

21:08.416 --> 21:10.083
<c.speaker>we are all in danger.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.416
<c.speaker>What are we gonna do?

21:14.291 --> 21:15.833
<c.speaker>[all gasp]

21:17.708 --> 21:18.750
<c.speaker>-[all exclaim]
-[Mateo] It's a sun bird!

21:21.500 --> 21:22.750
<c.speaker>Quita Moz?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.583
<c.speaker>Princess Elena, the flames
told me what happened.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.500
<c.speaker>So, you know.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.750
<c.speaker>I failed.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.375
<c.speaker>Yes. Yes, you lost
this round.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.750
<c.speaker>But the struggle
is not over.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.625
<c.speaker>You can still
defeat the sorceress

21:38.625 --> 21:41.500
<c.speaker>if you learn
all the powers
of your scepter.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.291
<c.speaker>Will you show me?

21:43.291 --> 21:46.458
<c.speaker>Hmm.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.625
<c.speaker>Climb on.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.458
<c.speaker>[Naomi]
Elena, good luck.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.000
<c.speaker>Let's do this!
