Oh, I can't, Donny.
Maybe later.

Aw. You never wanna play
with me.

That's not true.
I love playing with you.

you can do to cheer him up.

Here. I'll show you.

to play with.

you need a checkup.

Hi, sweets. Ooh, it's a hot day.
I brought you a glass of water.

to get dehydrated.

when you're dehydrated.

being dehydrated.

It's when you aren't

10:58.658 --> 11:02.662
Ooh! Ooh, yes.
It sure as stuffing is.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.205
Wow. You did it, Doc!

11:04.288 --> 11:06.123
You helped me
get healthy and strong.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.251
Donny's just gonna
love you all up, honey.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.504
Gosh, I-- I hope you're right.

11:11.587 --> 11:15.549

a fire engine like you
to play with.

Thanks, Doc. Bye.

what are you doing here?

11:30.689 --> 11:33.984
Whoa! You're working? Awesome!

11:34.068 --> 11:35.528
I missed you, buddy.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.156
[Donny] Now, come on!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.075
We got a fire to put out!

Come on, guys. Let's go play
with Donny and Lenny.

Help! Help! My house is on fire!

11:48.082 --> 11:50.709
Ah, come on.
I'm a dragon.

I don't need to be saved
by a little ol' lamb.

[Donny imitating siren]

11:58.384 --> 12:00.302
Doc, thanks for playing with me.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.638
You're the best sister ever.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.266
Donny, I love
hanging out with you.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.560
Almost as much as our toys do.

Hi, Doc.
Hi, Dad. Ooh!

12:24.743 --> 12:26.203
Can I borrow this?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.706
It's the perfect hat
for the famous adventurer

12:28.789 --> 12:30.458
Doc McStuffins!

12:30.541 --> 12:33.085
Watch out for danger
while you're out adventuring.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.880
Adventurers aren't scared
of danger.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.090
Oh! [giggles]

Here you go.

It sounds baa-rilliant.

Me, too!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.292
After all, I am a dragon,

13:13.375 --> 13:16.253
and dragons
are very, very brave.

Real dragons are brave, Stuffy.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.674
But you're a stuffed dragon.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.718
I'm just as brave as they are.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.638
As brave as a real dragon?

13:25.721 --> 13:27.389
I am. I'll prove it.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.310
I'll need both of you
to be brave adventurers today.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.024
[Doc] Okay, the king is keeping
the sparkly ball of sparkles

13:37.107 --> 13:38.734
over there
in The Lost Temple.

You're right.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.368
Someone needs to go up higher

is leaking out.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.556
Stuffy, are you okay?

14:09.765 --> 14:13.477
Of course I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be okay?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.729
Did you see anything
from up there?

14:15.813 --> 14:20.276
Yeah! There's a squeaky fish
and a snowman guarding
The Lost Temple.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.403
They must be working
for the Wicked King.

[Doc] Okay, here's the plan.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.207
Lambie and I will
distract the guards.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.667
Baa-rilliant!

14:37.084 --> 14:40.838
And I need a volunteer
to ride this rocket sled
to the temple.

14:40.921 --> 14:44.592
It's so fast, they'll
never be able to see you.
I'll do it.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.136
Dragons are great at riding
rocket sleds.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.596
Vroom!

14:48.679 --> 14:51.348
And are you brave enough
to face the Wicked King?

14:51.432 --> 14:54.393
Um, I think I am.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.354
Great! Let's give
the adventurer oath.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.273
We'll search through
ocean, sky, or cave.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.109
Adventurers are very brave.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.904
Lambie, let's distract
the guards.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.448
Whoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.824
[Doc] Whoo!
[Lambie] Baa!

15:08.908 --> 15:11.785
Sounds like something scary's
going on over there.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.997
I think you better
check it out.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.666
[squeaking]

15:18.500 --> 15:22.379
Hi, Squeakers.
You look like you
could use a cuddle.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.549
Nothing's more distracting
than a good cuddle.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.637
Uh-oh. Looks like
there's still one guard left.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.015
This will be my chance
to show just how brave I am!

Oh, no.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.777

15:45.027 --> 15:47.571
What? Oh! Nothing
a dragon can't handle.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.700
[giggles] Now go find
that sparkly ball
of sparkles.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.621
[twig cracks]

15:55.704 --> 15:59.208
Halt!

Oh, okay! Okay,
just go in already.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.007
Whew. That was
scary, Stuffy.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.634
That's how we dragons do it.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.095
And sorry I scared you, Chilly.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.224
Oh, it's okay.
I get scared of lots of things.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.896
[whispering]
Chilly, what are you doing?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.107
It's scary guarding
the temple.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.068
I'd rather be
with a big, brave dragon.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.861
So, can I come with you?

16:27.945 --> 16:30.364
Okay. But be quiet.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.658
We don't want
the Wicked King to hear us.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.743
Wicked King?
There's a wicked--

16:34.827 --> 16:36.328
Shh!

16:37.037 --> 16:39.164
[whispering]
Oh, right.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.749
Shh. Gotcha.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.633
[gasps] Stuffy, your stuffing!
It's falling out.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.136
Oh, you better tell Doc.
She can help you.

16:52.219 --> 16:55.097
Shh! Chilly,
I can't tell Doc.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.557
I have to show everyone

16:56.640 --> 16:58.350
I'm a big,
brave dragon.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.729
And big, brave dragons
don't ask for help.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.773
Whew. It's a good thing
I'm not a dragon.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.193
I'm always asking
for help.

17:08.277 --> 17:12.196
I have to keep going,
no matter how much
stuffing I lose.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.954
[gasps] Ooh.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.540
Oh, what is it?

17:21.623 --> 17:24.501
[Stuffy]
The sparkly ball
of sparkles!

17:25.711 --> 17:26.962
Doc, I got it!

17:27.046 --> 17:29.506
The sparkly ball of sparkles!

17:29.590 --> 17:31.633
He did it!
I knew he would.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.968
Way to go, Stuffy.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.011
Ha ha ha!

17:34.094 --> 17:35.345
Halt there!
Aah!

17:35.429 --> 17:38.182
Dragon, you can't
take that treasure,

17:38.265 --> 17:39.683
because I am the king,

17:39.767 --> 17:42.311
and I'm protecting it
with a magic spell.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.147
Aah! A magic spell!

Zing! Zing-zing!
Zing! Zing-zing!

17:48.067 --> 17:49.401
[Stuffy] Yipe!

17:49.485 --> 17:50.652
Ooh!

17:50.736 --> 17:54.865
I don't think
I like magic spells
from wicked kings.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.283
[breathing heavily]

17:56.366 --> 17:58.827
Oh, no.
More stuffing.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.662
[King] Zing! Zing-zing...

18:00.746 --> 18:02.831
Oh! Oh!

18:02.915 --> 18:04.374
Zing! Zing-zing!

18:04.458 --> 18:06.835
Run, Stuffy! Run!

18:06.919 --> 18:10.547
But Chilly joined our side,
and he's still in there.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.382
Well, then we have
to save him!

18:13.092 --> 18:16.595
Stuffy, I'll fly you over,
and Chilly can grab on
to your tail.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.723
M-m-my tail? Uh--

18:19.807 --> 18:22.518
You know, I'm sure
Chilly will be fine.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.313
No, I won't!
Save me! Save me!

18:26.396 --> 18:28.524
But why doesn't
Lambie save him?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.818
Cause you're
the brave dragon.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.321
I... I don't think
I want to play anymore.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.534
But, Stuffy,
you love being
a brave adventurer.

18:39.201 --> 18:43.288
Let me talk to him, Doc,
stuffed animal
to stuffed animal.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.749
Maybe he just
needs a cuddle.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.545
Okay, Lambie,
I know your cuddles always
make me feel better.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.425
Oh, what's the matter,
Stuffy?

18:55.509 --> 18:57.678
I've never seen you
quit a game before.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.555
Do you need a cuddle?

19:02.432 --> 19:06.061
[gasps] Stuffy,
you lost all the stuffing
out of your tail.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
You have to tell Doc.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.857
Lambie, I can't.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.067
Brave dragons don't
go running for help

19:12.151 --> 19:13.902
every time they get
a boo-boo.

19:14.361 --> 19:19.283
Oh, Stuffy! Even brave dragons
need help sometimes.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.451
They do?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.797
Now,
that's my brave dragon.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.550
Yeah! I'm a brave dragon.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
Very brave.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.095
Whoa!

20:24.181 --> 20:25.891
Whoa! Uh!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.434
Stuffy?

20:28.018 --> 20:31.980
Doc, I think there might be
something wrong with my tail.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.108
[Doc] Ooh, Stuffy,
what happened?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.735
Well...

20:36.818 --> 20:38.737
You threw me up
super high,

20:38.820 --> 20:40.781
Then, rip, my tail
catches on a branch.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.033
Stuffing was falling out.
I held my tail shut.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.661
I got on the skateboard,
the stuffing got in the wheels,

20:45.744 --> 20:47.412
and then
I went, "Whoo! Whoa! Wham!"

20:47.496 --> 20:49.539
Then I roared
at Chilly, and he said,

20:49.623 --> 20:50.666
"Your stuffing's falling out,"

20:50.749 --> 20:53.335
but I was a brave dragon and got
the sparkly ball of sparkles.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.629
But the King put a spell
on us and, "Zing, zing!"

20:55.712 --> 20:58.966
And then I came out
here, and...
[breathing heavily]

20:59.049 --> 21:01.051
...and my tail was all flat.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.553
But why didn't
you tell me?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.848
I guess I was afraid to.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.227
I wanted you to think that
I was a big, brave dragon.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.897
You <span style="style.default_1">are</span> brave.
It's very brave to ask for help.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.024
That's what I told him.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.111
Come on. Let's get
you a checkup!

21:22.531 --> 21:24.116
The Doc is in.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.496
Okay, Stuffy, step
onto the scale for me, please.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.085
Hmm, you're a little
lighter than usual,

21:35.168 --> 21:36.670
but that makes sense.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.297
Because of my missing
stuffing?

21:38.380 --> 21:42.009
Exactly. Now let me
check you with my
stethoscope.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.219
Could you take
a deep breath for me?

21:44.469 --> 21:45.554
[inhales]

21:45.846 --> 21:48.056
Good. Now breathe out.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.474
[exhales]

21:49.558 --> 21:51.143
Your breathing sounds good.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.811
Now let's check your heart.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.647
[heart beating]

21:55.731 --> 21:58.150
Stuffy, your heartbeat
sounds good.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.652
You have a very brave heart.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.237
[chuckles] Thanks.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.865
But your tail sounds
a little flat.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.326
I have a diagnosis.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.995
You have a bad case of
flat-tail-itis.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.834
Wow! My own page in
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

22:15.917 --> 22:18.086
It's almost worth losing
all my stuffing,

22:18.170 --> 22:20.464
'specially because I know
you can fix it, Doc.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.466
[gulps]

22:22.549 --> 22:24.509
You can fix it, right?

22:24.593 --> 22:28.221
There's one problem.
I don't know where
all your stuffing is.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.015
And I can't fix you without it.

22:30.098 --> 22:35.020
Hmm. Well, now that I know
I can ask for help
and still be brave,

22:35.103 --> 22:37.230
maybe I should
ask my friends

22:37.314 --> 22:39.191
to help me
find my stuffing.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.984
[Lambie] No need to ask, Stuffy.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.153
Here you go.
Look what we brought you!

22:43.236 --> 22:44.696
[Lambie] Of course
we found it!

22:44.780 --> 22:46.782
Oh, you guys
are the best.

22:49.284 --> 22:52.287
Ooh!
That feels better already.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.500
There you go, Stuffy.
Good as new.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.295
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better ♪</span>

23:00.378 --> 23:03.757
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Thank you, Doc</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For taking all the ouches away ♪</span>

23:03.840 --> 23:07.552
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Didn't feel so good</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Till you fixed me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like I knew that you would ♪</span>

23:07.636 --> 23:08.512
[chuckles]

23:08.595 --> 23:10.263
<span style="style.default_1">♪ And I feel better ♪</span>

23:10.347 --> 23:13.433
<span style="style.default_1">♪ So much better now ♪</span>

23:13.809 --> 23:15.435
Now that my tail is better,

23:15.519 --> 23:17.479
I feel braver than ever.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.815
[roars]

23:19.898 --> 23:21.066
[whimpers]

23:22.109 --> 23:23.026
Chilly?

23:24.528 --> 23:28.323
If I ask for help,
does that mean I'm brave?

23:28.406 --> 23:31.368
[all laugh]

23:32.953 --> 23:34.871
Hey, everybody, it's Doc here.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.332
<span style="style.default_1">When you're out playing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on a really hot day,</span>

23:37.415 --> 23:39.584
<span style="style.default_1">what should you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">remember to do?</span>

23:40.377 --> 23:42.462
<span style="style.default_1">Should you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">give a Boppy a hug?</span>

23:42.546 --> 23:44.548
[Boppy laughing]

23:45.298 --> 23:47.175
<span style="style.default_1">Should you trumpet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like an elephant?</span>

23:47.634 --> 23:48.718
[plays trumpet]

23:48.969 --> 23:51.263
<span style="style.default_1">Or should you drink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty of water?</span>

23:52.222 --> 23:53.056
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>

23:53.140 --> 23:55.809
<span style="style.default_1">On a hot day,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drink lots of water.</span>

23:57.310 --> 23:59.187
[laughs]
