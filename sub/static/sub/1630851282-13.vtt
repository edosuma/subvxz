I hope you understand.

19:40.965 --> 19:42.793
- I understand.

19:42.862 --> 19:45.379
I understand
you're an incredible uncle.

19:45.448 --> 19:47.379
I hope to grow up
to be just like you.

19:47.448 --> 19:48.965
You know, someone
who gets carried away

19:49.034 --> 19:50.724
over things that make the world
a little better.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.793
- Thank you, Munchy.
You're an incredible nephew.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.965
- I'm gonna miss you,
Uncle Nedward.

20:00.620 --> 20:01.758
- All right.

20:05.517 --> 20:10.344
Fly now, Munchy!
Fly like a hawk!

20:10.413 --> 20:13.620
- I'm a bubble!

20:13.689 --> 20:16.379
Whee!

20:16.448 --> 20:19.517
- Ahh!
It's a cloud with a face!

20:19.586 --> 20:21.896
- No, that's Bubble Munchy!
Move!

20:21.965 --> 20:23.379
- Whee!

20:26.172 --> 20:27.862
- Munchy, are you okay?

20:27.931 --> 20:30.448
- [grunting]

20:30.517 --> 20:33.241
That was amazing!

20:34.310 --> 20:35.862
- Thank goodness
you're all right.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.827
- Wow, it is hard
to hug a bubble.

20:42.793 --> 20:44.758
- It's okay. I feel the love.

20:48.931 --> 20:50.793
I'm glad I got over
my fear of heights,

20:50.862 --> 20:55.241
but I never want to be that far
away from you again, ground.

20:55.310 --> 20:56.827
- Hey, your Uncle Nedward
seems like

20:56.896 --> 20:58.379
he's doing okay up there.

20:58.448 --> 21:00.482
- All right,
future baby hawks,

look me in the eye!

[dramatic sting]

21:03.827 --> 21:06.103
Those egg shells seem hard
to you now,

21:06.172 --> 21:08.586
but they are made to be broken.

21:08.655 --> 21:14.000
Then one day, like my nephew
Munchy, you too shall fly!

21:16.724 --> 21:18.344
- Oh, hey, Dad.
How was the boat show?

21:18.413 --> 21:21.620
- It was great
until the yacht people

21:21.689 --> 21:24.137
came with all their attitude.

21:24.206 --> 21:26.000
Where's your brother?
- Oh, he's over there.

21:28.862 --> 21:31.517
- I can stand up
whenever I want to.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.241
I don't want to.

21:36.310 --> 21:37.448
- And where's Uncle Nedward?

21:37.517 --> 21:39.413
- He is at the top
of Old Cliffy,

21:39.482 --> 21:41.000
sitting on some hawk eggs.

21:41.068 --> 21:42.551
- Sounds like Nedward.

21:42.620 --> 21:45.689
- Actually, dad, this time,
he's cleaning up his own mess.

21:45.758 --> 21:49.241
- Good for him. And you didn't
destroy my house,

21:49.310 --> 21:51.000
which is good for me.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.413
- Hey, I have an idea.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.068
Let's throw Jaget down a hill.

21:58.137 --> 21:59.965
- I have been thinking
about that all day.

22:01.413 --> 22:03.068
- I know the perfect hill.

22:03.137 --> 22:05.724
- No! This is a bad idea.

22:05.793 --> 22:08.448
Mega Jaget doesn't like this!
