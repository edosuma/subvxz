00:01.300 --> 00:02.769
Previously on Z Nation.

00:02.869 --> 00:04.267
His name is Murphy.

00:04.367 --> 00:07.202
He's the only human known
to have survived a zombie bite.

00:07.237 --> 00:10.239
His blood has the antibodies
to create a vaccine.

00:10.273 --> 00:13.042
It is imperative that he be
transported alive

00:13.076 --> 00:15.344
to Mount Wilson CDC Lab
in California.

00:15.378 --> 00:17.179
Keep him alive at all costs.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.181
It's the apocalypse.
Let's have some fun.

00:20.116 --> 00:21.717
Isn't she cute?

00:22.319 --> 00:23.652
Save humanity.

00:24.521 --> 00:25.654
Save yourself.

00:25.689 --> 00:27.222
I have to save them!

00:27.257 --> 00:28.390
Find Murphy.

00:28.425 --> 00:30.225
And get him to California.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:13.436 --> 01:15.471
Is that really necessary?

01:15.972 --> 01:17.906
How are you holding up?

01:18.141 --> 01:19.408
I'm good.

01:20.877 --> 01:22.745
How are you holding up,
Mr. Jordan?

01:22.779 --> 01:24.480
Mr. Cruller.

01:24.514 --> 01:26.615
We're here today
to discuss your plea bargain

01:26.649 --> 01:29.051
before the federal court.
My client has said repeatedly

01:29.085 --> 01:31.553
that he will not plead guilty to
any of the charges.

01:31.588 --> 01:33.522
And he demands a trial
before his peers.

01:33.556 --> 01:34.890
What she said.

01:35.091 --> 01:36.759
We're aware
of your client's position.

01:36.793 --> 01:38.827
And I hope your client is aware
of the government's.

01:38.862 --> 01:41.130
If he chooses to go to trial
and loses,

01:41.164 --> 01:44.466
we intend to press for the
maximum on the espionage charges

01:44.501 --> 01:45.634
Life in prison.

01:45.668 --> 01:47.469
I want my day in court.

01:47.504 --> 01:48.570
I'm a citizen, not a spy.

01:48.605 --> 01:51.106
You're an incarcerated defendant
about to lose in court

01:51.141 --> 01:53.909
who will spend the
rest of his life behind bars.

01:53.943 --> 01:55.210
I won't plead guilty.

01:57.347 --> 01:59.047
You heard my client.

02:04.821 --> 02:06.488
What's going on?

02:11.795 --> 02:13.328
Mr. Cruller.

02:13.663 --> 02:17.766
I have a last, best,
and final offer for you.

02:17.801 --> 02:20.035
One I think you want to take.

02:20.136 --> 02:22.471
I'm sorry. And you are?

02:22.505 --> 02:23.439
Henry Semple.

02:23.473 --> 02:26.041
Signal Intelligence Officer
with the NSA.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.812
I'm leader of the team that
tracked down your client.

02:29.846 --> 02:32.848
Oh, hey. I love your work.

02:35.518 --> 02:38.020
You said something about
a final offer?

02:38.354 --> 02:42.357
Mr. Cruller. Your country is in
need of a man with your skills.

02:42.392 --> 02:44.993
In fact, we're going to need
all the help that we can get.

02:45.028 --> 02:47.996
You want to be a real patriot?
Now's your chance.

02:48.031 --> 02:51.500
Come work for me at the NSA
and we drop all charges.

02:54.671 --> 02:56.572
And I don't have to
plead guilty?

02:56.606 --> 02:58.173
You don't have to plead guilty.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.775
But I do need your answer
right now.

02:59.809 --> 03:01.143
We don't have much time.

03:01.177 --> 03:02.344
What's the hurry?

03:02.378 --> 03:05.314
You will be stationed at our
most forward listening post.

03:05.348 --> 03:06.648
Camp Northern Light?

03:06.983 --> 03:08.517
I've seen data from there.

03:08.551 --> 03:10.152
That's practically
in the North Pole.

03:10.186 --> 03:12.154
What would I be working on
up there?

03:12.188 --> 03:14.156
Keeping track of the Russians?
The Chinese?

03:14.190 --> 03:15.991
This is highly classified.

03:20.797 --> 03:23.632
You can't even share this
with your lawyer.

03:36.179 --> 03:37.346
Simon?

03:38.781 --> 03:40.482
How can I not look?

03:57.767 --> 04:00.736
What is this?
Is this code for something?

04:23.026 --> 04:24.526
File locked?

04:24.561 --> 04:26.562
When did I do that?

04:26.596 --> 04:28.196
I'm clearly losing my mind.

04:28.231 --> 04:29.531
Don't start.

04:29.566 --> 04:30.532
Let's see.

04:32.435 --> 04:35.304
Password denied? No,
I didn't change the password.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.273
Oh shit.

04:40.543 --> 04:42.177
I've been hacked.

a glass-half-full kinda guy.

05:28.858 --> 05:31.159
Especially when there's
no goddamn glass.

05:31.194 --> 05:33.295
All right,
looks like we're on foot.

05:33.329 --> 05:35.897

Let's hit it.

Come on, princess.

05:39.802 --> 05:41.536
Let's go.

05:52.415 --> 05:55.083
How much further to this
supposed rendezvous?

05:55.118 --> 05:57.786
A days walk. Maybe two.

05:58.221 --> 05:59.554
Everything looks the same.

05:59.589 --> 06:03.025
Yeah. Well four years
of zombie apocalypse and a nuke

06:03.059 --> 06:04.026
will do that.

06:05.228 --> 06:08.397
Nothing but rubble and dust.
Must have been a hell of a fight

06:08.431 --> 06:10.666
Makes you wonder what's left
that's worth saving.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.669
How did it come to this?

06:17.874 --> 06:18.507
No, sir.

06:19.876 --> 06:23.111
I've currently got six M-35s
scheduled for Philly.

06:23.146 --> 06:25.447
Departing at 1300.

06:26.416 --> 06:27.382
Absolutely.

06:33.823 --> 06:37.125
No. That's new news to me.

06:38.761 --> 06:44.399
No, Colonel. I was not informed
of a change in deployment.

06:52.008 --> 06:54.776
People!
For the last time, zip it!

06:55.812 --> 06:59.548
No, sir. Not you.
Where in Trenton, sir?

07:04.187 --> 07:06.421
I understand, Colonel.
Copy that.

07:06.456 --> 07:08.924
We'll be rolling at 1315.

07:08.958 --> 07:09.858
Yes, sir.

07:10.827 --> 07:13.295
All right, people.
You may have heard.

07:13.329 --> 07:16.064
Scratch Philly.
Head for Trenton.

07:16.099 --> 07:17.566
Lieutenant Warren?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.101
What do you need, Dineen?

07:19.135 --> 07:21.103
Any chance I could catch up with
my unit tonight?

07:21.137 --> 07:23.739
That's a negative. Philly's a
no-can-do. Just got orders

07:23.773 --> 07:26.541
to direct everything that we
have that rolls to Trenton.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.976
Trenton?
Why Trenton? What's going on?

07:28.010 --> 07:29.511
I have no idea, okay?

07:29.545 --> 07:33.482
They tell me to move vehicles,
that's what I do. Move vehicles.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.624
That doesn't sound good.

07:45.862 --> 07:48.630
Ugh,
it's gonna be one of those days.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.243
Anybody with this ambulance?!

08:02.178 --> 08:03.612
Hello?!

08:10.119 --> 08:12.788
Calling all units in the area,
please be advised

08:18.728 --> 08:20.662
Anybody here?!

08:22.565 --> 08:23.932
Are you hurt?!

08:28.471 --> 08:30.372
Oh god, somebody's in here.

08:32.942 --> 08:35.544
Someone call 911!

08:35.578 --> 08:38.145
Don't worry. Help is on the way.

08:38.181 --> 08:39.581
Why'd they leave you?

08:41.417 --> 08:42.751
I'll try to help you.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.354
Oh, dear God.

08:46.823 --> 08:48.523
Why are you not dead?

08:49.492 --> 08:51.760
It's okay. Help is on the way.

08:53.362 --> 08:55.263
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey,
no, no, no.

08:56.532 --> 08:59.134
Let go of me, pal. Stop it!

09:00.636 --> 09:02.304
What happened to you?

09:05.641 --> 09:07.676
I'm gonna go get some help.

09:10.613 --> 09:12.013
I need some help out here!

09:12.048 --> 09:15.383
Alvarez? Dineen? Anybody!

09:15.418 --> 09:17.085
Oh shoot.

09:18.888 --> 09:20.889
That's crazy.

09:23.092 --> 09:25.927
Alvarez? Lombardi? Fall in!

09:27.330 --> 09:29.664
Where the hell is everybody?!

09:32.869 --> 09:35.704
This is a worldwide alert.

09:35.738 --> 09:38.273
- Do not panic.
- Oh that can't be good.

09:38.307 --> 09:40.842
Stand by
for important information.

09:42.111 --> 09:44.880
Finally. Dineen!
Get your ass in here!

09:48.317 --> 09:49.284
Dineen.

09:50.052 --> 09:50.852
Oh God.

09:57.126 --> 09:58.760
What's happening?

10:07.069 --> 10:08.637
What's happening?

10:11.941 --> 10:12.707
Halt!

10:19.282 --> 10:20.382
Do not panic.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.250
Zombies.

10:23.252 --> 10:27.055
Hey, princess. Keep it moving!

10:41.871 --> 10:44.806
Do you have any idea
where we are?

10:45.541 --> 10:48.076
Somewhere in
sunny Southern California.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.345
Seriously, how much further?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.247
I don't feel so good.

10:53.816 --> 10:55.550
Well we could take a break.

10:55.885 --> 10:58.086
I'm curious myself.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.290
It can't be.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.694
So, where the hell are we?

11:07.930 --> 11:09.164
Disneyland.

11:09.799 --> 11:10.932
What?

11:11.233 --> 11:12.300
Uh huh.

11:12.802 --> 11:16.838
Hard to tell for sure, but
I think "It's a Small World"

11:16.872 --> 11:19.307
would have been
right over there.

11:23.746 --> 11:24.679
Sorry, kid.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.820
Break time's over.

11:41.931 --> 11:46.334
It's a world of laughter,
a world of tears.

11:46.502 --> 11:49.904
Doesn't matter how old you are
or where you went to school.

11:49.939 --> 11:53.141
Addiction can take hold of you
and you can't shake it

11:53.175 --> 11:54.209
without help.

11:55.144 --> 11:56.911
You even listening to this?

11:57.546 --> 11:58.880
What are you doing over there?

11:58.914 --> 12:00.648
Oh, sorry. I'm just
getting rid of a trigger.

12:00.683 --> 12:02.951
Somebody left some Oxy
laying around.

12:02.985 --> 12:06.087
Come on. I'm not that bad. Am I?

12:06.122 --> 12:08.556
Oh, no. It's not you, man.
It's me.

12:08.657 --> 12:10.358
I've been in recovery
for five years,

12:10.393 --> 12:12.127
but you still got to work at it.

12:12.161 --> 12:12.927
Five years.

12:12.962 --> 12:16.598
Wow. I've been sober six days.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.933
Five years seems impossible.

12:18.968 --> 12:22.737
Yeah well you know, it's a
struggle. One day at a time.

12:29.111 --> 12:30.779
Now you're gonna
go to your meetings, right?

12:30.813 --> 12:32.580
No one's going to meetings
right now.

12:32.615 --> 12:34.949
It took me an hour
to get through the roadblocks.

12:34.984 --> 12:36.918
That's why I ride a bike.

12:40.523 --> 12:42.157
Uh, you gonna answer that?

12:47.863 --> 12:49.931
Still got fifteen minutes.

12:53.436 --> 12:55.737
What the hell was that?

12:57.073 --> 13:00.208
I dunno. You wait here.
I'm gonna check that out.

13:01.077 --> 13:02.777
You're off the meter.

13:06.315 --> 13:09.551
Calm down,
everything's going to be ok.

13:09.585 --> 13:11.719
Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Stop,
stop, stop. Get away! Get away

13:11.754 --> 13:13.621
Stop, stop, stop.

13:14.223 --> 13:15.490
Hey, take it easy!

13:15.825 --> 13:17.125
Whoa, don't do that!

13:19.795 --> 13:20.962
Hold on there, fella.

13:20.996 --> 13:21.863
What's his name?

13:21.897 --> 13:22.997
Bernie. He's my patient.

13:23.032 --> 13:25.166
Bernie. Why so upset, Bernie?

13:25.201 --> 13:27.302
He just found out
his wife's leaving him.

13:27.336 --> 13:29.671
Oh, man. I'm sorry, man.
That's terrible. But

13:30.639 --> 13:32.407
Come on. Stop struggling
and I'll let you go.

13:32.441 --> 13:35.243
I knew she was cheating on me.
I knew it!

13:36.011 --> 13:37.145
That's rough, man.

13:37.179 --> 13:38.947
But you got a great therapist
here in Doctor Sanders.

13:38.981 --> 13:40.949
She's gonna help you
deal with it.

13:40.983 --> 13:42.617
I'm telling you,
she's the best.

13:42.651 --> 13:45.620
I know. I'm sorry,
Doctor Sanders.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.889
I'll pay for the lamp.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.292
You starting to feel
a little better now?

13:51.560 --> 13:53.528
Okay,
well I'm gonna let you go.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.700
I'm sorry.

13:59.001 --> 14:01.035
I don't know why I let her
make me so crazy.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.704
Well that's what
the doctor's for.

14:03.105 --> 14:04.606
How you feeling?

14:04.874 --> 14:05.940
I'm good.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.109
All right. Let's hug it out.

14:08.144 --> 14:09.244
Okay.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.747
Here, why don't you sit down?
Relax, okay?

14:12.781 --> 14:13.948
Okay.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.517
No more freaking out.

14:15.551 --> 14:16.718
I'm sorry.

14:16.752 --> 14:18.720
Okay, I'm gonna get back
to my patient now.

14:18.754 --> 14:20.922
You be cool, Bernie.

14:21.190 --> 14:24.225
Remember, you're not alone.

14:30.199 --> 14:32.734
Oh jeez. Sorry.

14:32.768 --> 14:34.569
Didn't mean to intrude.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.605
Wait a minute.
What did I just see?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.641
Larry and his gay lover?

14:39.675 --> 14:41.576
It's funny he never
mentioned him.

14:41.610 --> 14:44.312
Two patients
wrestling on the couch?

14:44.346 --> 14:47.949
Reminds me of my days at
Woodstock, only more mud.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.419
It's a damn zombie.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.987
Hang on, Larry!

14:56.692 --> 14:58.626
Damn.
Did you see that?

15:05.734 --> 15:06.935
Larry?

15:08.370 --> 15:10.138
That thing got you?
Oh, man.

15:26.422 --> 15:28.156
Oh, this is happening.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.066
What am I doing?

16:03.926 --> 16:04.559
Oh.

16:06.895 --> 16:10.031
Oh,
I didn't see this one coming.

16:16.872 --> 16:17.839
Here we go.

16:27.716 --> 16:30.485
Oh, there you are.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.928
I don't get it.

16:53.630 --> 16:56.799
These servers have been
powered down since the blast.

16:56.833 --> 16:57.900
How the hell could

17:10.347 --> 17:12.647
Well look at that.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.983
Well played.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.492
All right.

17:24.528 --> 17:27.195
Let's see who's been
sleeping in my bed.

17:47.751 --> 17:50.419
Come on! Woo!

18:00.263 --> 18:01.630
Kill him! That was icing!

18:01.665 --> 18:04.466
Don't let him push you around!
Come on!

18:08.238 --> 18:10.272
Go Chiefs! Go Chiefs! Go Chief!

18:11.575 --> 18:12.975
Come on! Get him!

18:14.311 --> 18:15.644
You wanna dance, Beale?

18:15.679 --> 18:16.278
Come on, Thompson.

18:16.313 --> 18:17.379
- Let's go.
- You want this?

18:17.414 --> 18:18.781
- Let's go!
- Come on!

18:20.016 --> 18:21.450
Is it zombie night?

18:21.484 --> 18:23.052
No, that's next Thursday.

18:43.073 --> 18:44.607
Whoa.

18:50.247 --> 18:51.580
Get your skates off.

18:51.615 --> 18:52.414
Okay.

18:57.354 --> 18:59.088
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:59.990 --> 19:01.056
Hurry up.

19:01.091 --> 19:01.790
I got them.

19:01.825 --> 19:03.626
Hey, hey. Back off, man.

19:03.660 --> 19:04.660
Back off! I'm serious!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.340
What are we supposed to do?

19:18.375 --> 19:19.375
I don't know.

19:22.212 --> 19:23.445
Defend yourself.

19:50.407 --> 19:51.573
Hold on.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.556
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

20:07.590 --> 20:08.223
You got bit?

20:08.258 --> 20:10.159
No! And I'm not gonna be.

20:11.761 --> 20:15.064
Oh my God, that's Jordan Beale.
He was our best forward.

20:15.098 --> 20:16.098
Wasn't that good.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.633
Obviously.

20:19.336 --> 20:20.969
What's it like out there?

20:21.004 --> 20:22.137
It's insane.

20:22.172 --> 20:25.841
People are crazy. There's blood
everywhere. We got to go.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.310
No, no, no, no.
Not that way. No.

20:28.345 --> 20:28.977
Uh.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.423
How do we get out of here?

20:41.458 --> 20:42.925
Well that says exit.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.460
Streets safe?

20:44.494 --> 20:46.695
Well it's that
or wait for this to die down.

20:46.730 --> 20:47.863
You mean wait to die.

20:47.897 --> 20:48.263
Right.

20:48.298 --> 20:48.597
Okay.

20:48.631 --> 20:49.398
Come on.

20:49.432 --> 20:50.132
Come on.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.338
Come on!

21:13.690 --> 21:15.224
You okay?

21:15.258 --> 21:17.025
Thank you.

21:18.595 --> 21:21.830
I think, I think we should,
we should stick together, right?

21:21.865 --> 21:22.331
Yeah.

21:22.599 --> 21:24.099
Hey, I got to go home.

21:24.134 --> 21:27.336
I got to go home. My mom and my
brother, they're home.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.404
They're alone.
That's, that's... yeah.

21:28.438 --> 21:30.272
- You'll go?
- I'll go with you.

21:37.313 --> 21:38.313
I'm Mack.

21:38.748 --> 21:39.782
Addy.

21:40.417 --> 21:41.383
Okay?

21:41.818 --> 21:42.618
Okay.

22:05.330 --> 22:11.402
This sucks.
Even for us, this sucks.

23:14.399 --> 23:15.632
Hello?

23:23.775 --> 23:25.142
Are you okay?

23:26.144 --> 23:27.611
Can I help you?

23:33.051 --> 23:34.251
Oh my God.

23:36.221 --> 23:39.022
Are you okay?
Who did this to you?

23:42.427 --> 23:44.428
Hey. What are you doing?

23:49.601 --> 23:50.601
Hey, help!

23:50.635 --> 23:53.003
Hey, somebody shot this ranger
full of arrows.

23:53.037 --> 23:54.638
She's in really bad shape.

23:54.672 --> 23:55.606
She needs

23:55.874 --> 23:57.908
Hey, what's wrong with you?

23:57.942 --> 23:59.276
What are you doing?

24:46.691 --> 24:48.225
Dad?

24:49.727 --> 24:50.627
Dad?

25:07.846 --> 25:08.979
Tommy!

25:09.013 --> 25:10.414
Dad! They tried to kill me!

25:10.448 --> 25:13.317
Tommy, thank God you're alive.
Grab that weapon and come on.

25:21.626 --> 25:23.227
Hurry up, son.
Shit's going down.

25:53.902 --> 25:55.336
Gotcha.

25:55.604 --> 25:57.005
All right, you clumsy bastard.

25:57.039 --> 26:00.008
Think you can just
walk into my back door? Ha.

26:02.578 --> 26:04.579
Let's just follow
your big ol' footprints

26:04.613 --> 26:05.668
right back to your house.

26:49.224 --> 26:53.661
Mr. Vasquez?
Javier, is that you?

26:53.996 --> 26:55.430
You scared me.

26:56.899 --> 26:58.066
I'm sorry.

27:00.069 --> 27:03.371
I didn't mean to intrude.
Take all the time you need.

27:03.472 --> 27:05.940
I'm very sorry for your loss.

28:16.812 --> 28:18.346
Hey.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.848
Hey!

28:21.283 --> 28:24.485
Hey, you got rats in here
or something?

28:24.586 --> 28:27.321
God dammit. This doesn't end.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.546
Angie?

29:03.559 --> 29:07.361
Thank God.
I thought I was losing my mind.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.738
What in God's name?

29:52.274 --> 29:53.107
Die!

29:53.742 --> 29:55.543
Die!

30:13.662 --> 30:15.196
No!

31:42.075 --> 31:44.210
How did I get here?

31:45.712 --> 31:47.647
Look at all of you.

31:48.382 --> 31:50.249
What do you want?

31:50.751 --> 31:53.352
What can you want?

31:53.987 --> 31:55.788
Do I give a damn?

31:56.657 --> 31:57.890
I do.

31:58.592 --> 32:00.226
But why?

32:01.395 --> 32:03.095
The vaccine.

32:04.097 --> 32:06.232
But why me?

32:06.833 --> 32:10.169
I don't want to be
the savior of the human race.

32:10.270 --> 32:12.738
I don't want to be
the Zombie Messiah.

32:12.773 --> 32:15.141
I don't want to be shit.

32:15.575 --> 32:18.044
This is all
some terrible mistake.

32:18.378 --> 32:22.248
I just want to crawl off and die
like everybody else.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.850
Why me?

32:25.352 --> 32:27.286
What did I do?

32:27.921 --> 32:30.589
Where is my mercy?

32:37.464 --> 32:39.265
No tears, ladies.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.177
This a private game?

32:52.179 --> 32:54.680
It's prison. Nothing's private.

32:56.149 --> 32:58.751
I'm Murphy.
This is Nazarian and Fuentes.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.186
Urwin. What are we playing?

33:00.220 --> 33:03.189
Draw poker.
What you in for, Urwin?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.124
Conspiracy to distribute.

33:05.325 --> 33:07.226
You and Nazarian should have
plenty to talk about.

33:07.260 --> 33:10.062
I think he used to be
a customer of yours.

33:10.630 --> 33:13.899
I'm also awaiting trial
for attempted murder.

33:14.468 --> 33:16.702
But think I'll beat that.
What about you?

33:16.737 --> 33:19.305
I'm an entrepreneur whose
company under performed

33:19.339 --> 33:22.675
due to market conditions
beyond my control.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.010
Feds called it postal fraud.

33:25.245 --> 33:26.579
So how do I know this game
is honest?

33:26.613 --> 33:29.215
Just assume it isn't,
and you'll do fine.

33:31.318 --> 33:32.418
I got nothing.

33:33.854 --> 33:35.388
Half a pack of menthols.

33:35.422 --> 33:37.189
- I fold.
- Dealer takes one.

33:37.224 --> 33:40.559
Too rich for your blood, huh
homies? What about you, Murphy?

33:40.594 --> 33:41.327
You in?

33:48.535 --> 33:50.136
I got nothing.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.440
But you only took one card.
Why you folding now?

33:54.941 --> 33:56.275
I wanna see those cards.

33:58.945 --> 33:59.712
Game over.

34:14.828 --> 34:15.460
Hey.

34:15.495 --> 34:16.762
Is anybody else seeing this?

34:33.413 --> 34:34.580
Hey. Murphy.

34:35.782 --> 34:36.348
Murphy.

34:40.554 --> 34:42.655
Open the door,
you son of a bitch.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.151
Can't sleep?

35:14.788 --> 35:16.655
Can't dream either.

35:18.258 --> 35:20.092
When did that happen?

35:20.126 --> 35:21.694
Long time ago.

35:24.397 --> 35:25.764
Long time.

35:27.567 --> 35:29.435
You gonna be all right?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.541
I don't think I can do it.

35:35.575 --> 35:36.942
Yes, you can.

35:37.244 --> 35:40.713
Just take a couple pints of my
blood to satisfy the masses

35:40.747 --> 35:42.982
and let me
slip out the back door

35:43.016 --> 35:45.551
if we ever get the hell
where we're going.

35:45.886 --> 35:48.487
If you were really my friend,
you would help me.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.389
But I'm not your friend.

35:50.824 --> 35:52.324
I promised some people

35:52.359 --> 35:55.928
that I would get you
to a lab in California,

35:55.962 --> 35:57.897
and I'm gonna do that.

35:58.298 --> 36:01.467
Come on.
We're almost there.

36:03.036 --> 36:05.337
They're gonna hurt me.
You know that, right?

36:05.372 --> 36:08.507
I won't let that happen. You can't
stop it if you're not there.

36:08.542 --> 36:12.378
Murphy, this is the apocalypse.

36:12.846 --> 36:15.514
Look, I can't tell you
it's not gonna hurt.

36:16.082 --> 36:18.817
The truth is eventually we're
all gonna get hurt.

36:18.852 --> 36:21.921
There isn't a happy ending
for any of us.

36:21.955 --> 36:23.822
But you.

36:24.457 --> 36:28.694
You are the one person
that can change that.

36:29.329 --> 36:31.397
You got to do it alone.

36:32.566 --> 36:33.899
Even if it hurts.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.307
They'll be gone soon.

36:43.643 --> 36:45.678
You better wake the others.

37:11.306 --> 37:12.706
All right.

37:12.974 --> 37:16.343
So from a server in Ukraine,
to a cell phone tower in India,

37:16.378 --> 37:18.345
to a satellite dish farm
in South Africa,

37:18.380 --> 37:20.948
then back to my own server.
Nice move.

37:21.383 --> 37:25.052
Then back to China,
Mexico, Antarctica,

37:25.086 --> 37:27.121
and the final connection
leading to

37:27.288 --> 37:28.489
Molokai, Hawaii?

37:28.823 --> 37:30.124
What's on Molokai?

37:30.158 --> 37:31.225
Alright.

37:31.259 --> 37:33.727
Right this way. Time for your
digital colonoscopy.

37:34.696 --> 37:35.963
You call that security?

37:35.997 --> 37:39.066
What, do you have a zombie
for a Sys Admin?

37:39.100 --> 37:40.968
Come on.

37:41.903 --> 37:43.137
This is actually kinda fun.

37:43.171 --> 37:47.141
Reminds me of the good old days.
All right, all right.

37:47.175 --> 37:48.776
Come to daddy.

37:48.810 --> 37:52.112
Oh, you're making this
way to easy.

37:52.781 --> 37:56.417
All right.
Now, recent downloads.

37:56.451 --> 37:59.353
Let's find out why you went to
all this trouble.

37:59.387 --> 38:00.821
What is all this?

38:00.855 --> 38:02.990
Transmission logs
for Delta Xray Delta?

38:04.125 --> 38:06.326
Somebody hacked
Operation Bitemark.

38:07.061 --> 38:11.398
Holy shit. They've been using me
to track Murphy this whole time.

38:46.034 --> 38:47.468
Are we there yet?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.904
You've been asking that
for the past 3000 miles.

38:50.939 --> 38:53.340
Yeah, I know.
But this time I really mean it.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.975
Seriously.
Shouldn't we be there by now?

38:55.009 --> 38:56.009
Yeah, we're close.

38:56.044 --> 38:57.144
How close?

38:57.178 --> 39:00.481
Like should be
through those trees close.

39:01.749 --> 39:03.417
What's that smell?

39:06.187 --> 39:08.622
That is fresh air, girl.

39:09.524 --> 39:11.024
It's the ocean.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.427
Damn.

39:13.461 --> 39:14.795
Pacific Ocean.

39:15.129 --> 39:16.964
I can't believe we made it.

39:17.365 --> 39:19.433
We haven't made it yet.

39:20.268 --> 39:23.370
Come on.
It should be through there.

39:31.346 --> 39:32.579
That's it?

39:32.680 --> 39:34.281
According to the GPS.

39:34.382 --> 39:35.782
Are you sure?

39:35.884 --> 39:36.517
That's it.

39:36.551 --> 39:37.684
Doesn't look very high tech.

39:37.719 --> 39:39.920
Maybe it's just another front
for an underground lab.

39:39.954 --> 39:44.191
Maybe it's exactly what it looks
like, an abandoned greasy spoon.

39:44.225 --> 39:46.493
One last cosmic joke
at my expense.

39:46.528 --> 39:49.062
Either way,
we're gonna check it out.

39:50.498 --> 39:52.866
How do you want to handle this?

39:53.301 --> 39:56.603
Well I don't want us all to go
walking into some kind of trap.

39:56.638 --> 39:59.973
So you and I will go in light,
check it out.

40:00.008 --> 40:04.811
You guys, stay here with Murphy.
And get him into this.

40:05.747 --> 40:06.813
Oh hell no.

40:06.848 --> 40:10.217
Oh hell yes. I don't want
anybody recognizing you.

40:10.251 --> 40:11.818
Probably some bounty hunters
lurking around

40:11.853 --> 40:13.287
that heard one of those
broadcasts.

40:13.321 --> 40:17.958
We did not get you this far to
lose you to neo-nazi-numbskulls.

40:19.227 --> 40:21.361
Yes, dear.
Anything you say, dear.

40:21.963 --> 40:22.729
Thank you.

40:23.097 --> 40:24.865
If we're not out in
ten minutes

40:24.899 --> 40:26.667
We'll come busting in after you.

40:26.768 --> 40:28.035
No. You protect the package.

40:28.069 --> 40:29.903
Contact Citizen Z
for instructions.

40:29.938 --> 40:32.372
After we come busting in
after you.

40:32.407 --> 40:35.776
Ten minutes. Then GTFO.

40:38.546 --> 40:39.513
You ready?

40:39.847 --> 40:41.315
Always.

41:06.874 --> 41:08.041
See anything?

41:08.076 --> 41:09.443
I hear music.

41:41.843 --> 41:44.478
Would you like some tea
and finger sandwiches?

41:44.812 --> 41:47.180
How bout you put the weapon
you got under the counter

41:47.215 --> 41:48.949
on top of the bar.

41:49.684 --> 41:54.988
Sorry. These days
you just never know.

41:55.023 --> 41:56.490
