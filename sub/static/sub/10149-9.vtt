WEBVTT

01:19.205 --> 01:20.205
What?

01:21.499 --> 01:22.499
Aah!

01:29.298 --> 01:32.009
I've seen month-old fish
that smelled better than this.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.679
Could be for real.
Somebody might be hurt.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.888
All right. Go check.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.810
Here. In case it's a fish.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.687
Right. Look up after me.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.605
You don't have to remind me.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.217
Mayday! Mayday! This is Car 20
on route Apple Baker Four. We need...

02:23.227 --> 02:24.227
Aah!

02:30.443 --> 02:31.819
We need help! Please!

02:33.696 --> 02:36.282
<i>It's a giant!
He's gotta be ten feet tall!</i>

02:36.615 --> 02:37.992
<i>We're on route Apple Baker Four.</i>

02:38.075 --> 02:40.453
<i>- Near the dam! Hurry!</i>
- Hear that?

02:40.745 --> 02:42.538
Did you really believe
Big Time would lay low

02:42.621 --> 02:44.381
after going to all that trouble
to break out?

02:44.540 --> 02:45.875
I had my hopes.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.054
You're not thinking
of going there, are you?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.545
Of course I am.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.630
<i>Terry, leave this to the police.</i>

02:51.714 --> 02:53.049
Why should I do that?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.135
Because Charlie "Big Time"
is your friend.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.510
Was my friend.

03:14.737 --> 03:15.737
Hmm'?

03:25.331 --> 03:26.457
Hold it right there!

03:53.943 --> 03:54.943
Aah!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.991
I had everything covered.
Went over it 100 times.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.576
But how do you plan for Batman?

05:26.243 --> 05:29.163
- At least I got a sack of creds.
- Where?

05:29.622 --> 05:31.874
Right here, in my pocket.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.043
I knew we'd make a good team.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.837
My brains, your size.

05:37.171 --> 05:41.509
Just 'cause I look like this now
doesn't mean I lost any IQ points.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.718
Know what I'm saying?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.970
Sure, Big Time. Sure.

05:53.229 --> 05:55.022
- Got away, huh?
- Yeah.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.941
He was working with a partner,
but I didn't see...

05:59.109 --> 06:00.152
Wait a minute.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.839
You're thinking I didn't do
everything I could to stop him

06:02.863 --> 06:04.143
because he used to be my friend.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.450
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.373
That's right, Leo.
The Major's back in business.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.226
And I'm giving you
and a couple of others

06:14.250 --> 06:15.793
a chance to get in on it.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.171
I got that covered now.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.258
Big Time, that's who.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.637
Leo, I'll call you back.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.893
What's the matter, big guy?

06:32.977 --> 06:35.271
You said we were gonna be partners.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.191
- We are.
- Come on, Maj.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.610
You've been making
all the decisions around here.

06:42.278 --> 06:46.031
And these guys you're bringing in?
They're your friends, not mine.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.534
Bigs, you know any married people?

06:48.784 --> 06:52.413
The husband and the wife,
they don't both wash the dishes.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.582
One cooks and the other washes.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.834
Each does what they do best.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.586
But I keep telling ya, I'm...

06:58.836 --> 07:01.005
I know, I know. You got a brain.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.550
And I'm sure it's a good one.
But it needs more seasoning.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.136
Understand? Give it time.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.573
You haven't told me what you think, Max.

07:12.725 --> 07:14.476
You mean, do I agree with the old man?

07:14.727 --> 07:16.562
That's something
I try not to make a habit of.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.648
Me, too. Problem is he's usually right.

07:20.316 --> 07:23.360
When I saw Charlie last night,
all 10'6" of him,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.338
all I could think was that
if it hadn't been for me

07:25.362 --> 07:27.239
that Cerestone
wouldn't have spilled on him.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.450
He never would have
turned into a monster.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.369
So, it's guilt, huh?
Well, let me tell you something.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.121
Charlie was always a monster.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.832
Only now,
his outside matches his insides.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.467
Hey! What are you doing?

07:48.510 --> 07:49.510
Let go of him!

07:51.388 --> 07:52.388
Aah!

08:25.297 --> 08:26.737
We were on our way home from school.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.399
- The car came out of nowhere and-
<i>- Max!</i>

08:28.634 --> 08:29.986
It didn't have a license plate and...

08:30.010 --> 08:31.387
- <i>Max.</i>
- I tried to stop him.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.555
- Really, I did, but...
- Max!

08:34.640 --> 08:36.517
What about the suit?
Did he have it with him?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.394
<i>He dropped it. I got it here.</i>

08:38.686 --> 08:39.853
I'll be right over.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.619
<i>Don't even think of putting it on.</i>

09:06.380 --> 09:09.425
Good to see ya, Tiny. I've missed ya.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.135
That's why you had me kidnapped?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.262
What was I supposed to do?

09:13.429 --> 09:17.182
Stroll over to your house
and knock on the door looking like this?

09:18.726 --> 09:20.018
Have you seen any doctors?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.396
Doctors. What do they know?

09:24.189 --> 09:26.608
At least here I got compensation.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.109
Look.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.573
It's all the stuff we wanted
back when we were kids. Remember?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.994
And now it's yours... partner.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.619
Come on.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.247
We've been through this before.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.833
Look, I need ya.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.252
These other guys here?
I don't know any of them.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.296
I got nobody I can trust.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.548
- Same old Charlie.
- What do you mean?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.717
You're not doing me a favor
bringing me in.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.302
You're doing one for yourself.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.234
You need a guy to watch your back,
so you thought of good ol' Tiny.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.683
Terry, please.
You don't know what it's like here.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.727
Everyone thinks I'm a freak.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.438
I need somebody who knows the real me.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.608
That's the trouble, Charlie.
I do know the real you.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.827
Charlie!

10:19.870 --> 10:20.870
What's the matter?

10:23.665 --> 10:24.708
Nothing.

10:31.757 --> 10:32.800
Who's that?

10:33.217 --> 10:34.217
Uh...

10:34.551 --> 10:35.636
A friend.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.890
You brought a friend here?
Now he knows where the hideout is!

10:40.390 --> 10:42.267
I had him blindfolded.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.896
I just wanted him
to work with us, that's all.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.067
Since when is that your decision?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.402
- You said...
- I said give it time.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.197
- Or don't you remember?
- How could I forget?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.907
That's all you ever say!

10:57.074 --> 10:59.326
Will ya calm down?
You're acting like a...

10:59.409 --> 11:02.162
A what? Go on, say it!

11:02.496 --> 11:04.289
_l\/laj?
- What?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.793
Get him! Get him!

11:18.095 --> 11:21.473
Looks like your friend doesn't want
anything to do with you anymore.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.976
Major, I'm sorry.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.062
Then fix it. Or you're finished.

12:19.865 --> 12:20.865
Whoa!

13:22.052 --> 13:23.512
I can't do it.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.681
I don't care if he kills me.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.558
Charlie, you gotta go to the cops.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.477
I can't do that either.

13:30.811 --> 13:34.731
They'd never be able to protect me
once the Major finds out I let you go.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.900
He doesn't have to find out.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.670
I know the police commissioner.
She's a friend of Bruce Wayne's.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.464
She could make it look like
the cops caught you

13:41.488 --> 13:42.864
right after you left the hideout.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.158
But then I end up in jail.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.327
What were you expecting, a medal?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.788
I don't wanna go back in, Terry.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.416
It won't be forever.
They'll go light on you.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.210
And while you're in,
the doctors will be working on a cure.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.628
A cure?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.761
My dream, getting into the big time.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.347
Kind of a nightmare now, huh?

14:07.806 --> 14:10.267
Mr. Wayne has hundreds
of scientists on his payroll.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.770
- The best in the world.
- And he'd do this for me?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.731
No. He's gonna do it for me.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.210
Now come on. We're running out of time.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.281
Wait. If something goes wrong,
I'd be safer on the outside.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.659
- Nothing's gonna go wrong.
- But if it does?

14:29.202 --> 14:32.956
What if I stay here till you come back
and tell me they got the Major?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.756
Terry, I'll be here. I swear.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.883
Double time, everybody!

14:42.966 --> 14:46.029
The cops are gonna be here any minute
to find out what the shooting was about.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.721
Are we gonna leave without Big Time?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.097
Don't worry about it.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.932
How hard could it be to find him again?

15:20.128 --> 15:23.590
They wouldn't have sent all these cars
just to check on some laser fire.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.176
You're right. Somebody must have
told them about us.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.887
- Big Time?
- He'd never do that to me! Never!

15:29.137 --> 15:31.389
Maj, what are we gonna do about this?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.225
I'll tell ya one thing.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.060
Surrender is not an option.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.483
Aah!

15:45.028 --> 15:46.028
Aah!

16:08.176 --> 16:09.176
Charlie?

16:11.972 --> 16:14.057
Why am I surprised? Why?

16:14.558 --> 16:15.798
I'll put out a bulletin on him.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.034
What happened? You panic?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.913
I was never gonna go to the cops.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.333
I only went along with it
so you'd get rid of the Major for me.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.417
What?

16:41.585 --> 16:45.297
I wanted to bring you and some others in
and gradually push him out.

16:45.630 --> 16:49.009
But when you ran off,
I thought of a faster way of doing it.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.387
See, the Major's got
lots more men all over town.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.264
And now they're my men.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.683
And none of them know
I helped take him down.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.603
They're all gonna think
you ran straight to the cops

16:59.853 --> 17:01.688
and I was able to get away.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.190
But the Commissioner knows.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.901
You think anybody in my circle
would believe a cop?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.658
You figured it all out,
didn't you, smart guy?

17:13.992 --> 17:16.411
But you forgot one thing. The cure.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.956
For what? I like the way I look.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.793
The minute I walk into a room,
I get respect.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.963
- So even that was a lie.
- Yeah.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.466
And there's one more thing I lied about.

17:29.633 --> 17:33.428
When I said I couldn't kill ya,
I just didn't want to do it then.

17:33.845 --> 17:38.308
But now, I made you an offer,
and you turned it down.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.310
Where's the respect?

18:12.175 --> 18:13.426
Stay out of this!

18:31.861 --> 18:32.861
Ha!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.548
Terry, leave him for the police.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.217
You're starting to repeat yourself,
you know that?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.870
Let's see how well you fly
without those wings!

19:35.884 --> 19:36.884
Aah!

19:51.900 --> 19:53.526
Help me.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.957
I'm sorry.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.293
I know how hard it is
to go against a friend.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.421
I outgrew him, that's all.
