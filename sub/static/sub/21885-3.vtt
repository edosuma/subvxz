WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.878
We're on the same page.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.588
I wanna team up with you guys.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.882
What? Why? You do? What?

00:07.258 --> 00:09.885
I'm in a bit of a bind
and I could use some back-up.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.346
So, what do you say? New best friends?

00:13.764 --> 00:14.682
Stop it.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.891
You wanna team up?

00:16.058 --> 00:18.519
You've been torturing us
and lying about it.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.771
Let's not get all caught up
on who lied to who

00:20.855 --> 00:24.025
or which one of us created
an entire fake reality

00:24.108 --> 00:27.278
in order to cause eternal misery
for the others.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.904
That's ancient history.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.698
It was happening until 20 seconds ago.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.991
The point is that...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.994
circumstances have changed.

00:35.244 --> 00:38.539
And now, all of us teaming up
is our best option.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.584
I love being on teams!
Oh, we need a team name.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.585
Um...

00:42.960 --> 00:44.587
the Bobcats.
- Great.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.965
Slow down, ding-dong.
He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.508
He needs us.

00:49.967 --> 00:50.885
Why?

00:51.052 --> 00:54.305
Because, as you said, you keep beating me.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.018
Look, I built this Neighbourhood
as a way to torture the four of you

00:59.185 --> 01:02.229
psychologically for thousands of years.

01:02.313 --> 01:06.484
And you keep figuring it out
and taking all the fun out of it.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.568
Fun?

01:07.860 --> 01:11.030
Today, there was a new development
that really chapped my nips.

01:11.197 --> 01:13.699
One of my employees is blackmailing me.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.078
Vicky. She runs the clam chowder place

01:17.203 --> 01:19.580
in the main square -
"A Little Bit Chowder Now".

01:19.663 --> 01:22.249
- Oh, the place with the chowder fountain.
- No.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.459
That's "Pump Up the Clam."

01:23.542 --> 01:26.003
"A Little Bit Chowder Now"
has the lazy river of chowder.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.839
Ugh! How did we ever think
this was the Good Place?

01:28.923 --> 01:32.051
Vicky thinks that she can run
this Neighbourhood better than I can.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.805
And she wants to start her version
in 30 minutes.

01:36.222 --> 01:39.100
I'm supposed to reboot you,
erase your memory

01:39.225 --> 01:41.352
and turn control over to her.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.814
How are we supposed to team up
with you if you wipe our memories again?

01:44.897 --> 01:47.108
Easy. I'm not going to.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.735
You're going to act like
you've been rebooted

01:49.860 --> 01:52.696
and pretend that Vicky
and the others are torturing you.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.241
But then, on your own time, in private

01:55.574 --> 01:58.369
you can study ethics, ogle mailmen

01:58.452 --> 02:00.204
do whatever you want.
- Can I play iPad?

02:00.371 --> 02:01.956
Sure you can, buddy.
- Yes!

02:02.039 --> 02:04.166
Guys, there's no debate here.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.128
My boss gave me two chances
to make this work.

02:07.670 --> 02:11.090
Suffice to say, I tried more than two times.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.468
If he finds out, we're all in hot water.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.761
Literally.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.096
They will boil us.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.766
We will be the main ingredient
in a chowder of pain.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.310
Oh, dear.
- But if you help me

02:23.435 --> 02:25.521
you stop being tortured

02:25.896 --> 02:30.025
the Neighbourhood looks like it's working,
and I never get in trouble with my boss.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.403
Everybody's happy.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.654
Who's in?

02:34.196 --> 02:36.115
Human meeting. Bedroom. Now.

02:37.992 --> 02:42.621
Oh, yeah, um, that whole no-stair thing,
that was part of the torture.

02:42.705 --> 02:43.998
Let me... uh...

02:46.458 --> 02:48.002
Son of a bench.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.886
Anyone have any ideas?
- You know, believe it or not

02:56.969 --> 02:58.804
I actually found myself
in a very similar situation

02:58.888 --> 03:02.224
a few years ago, except in that instance,
Michael was Javier Bardem

03:02.516 --> 03:04.768
and the Bad Place was
Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.855
OK, stop talking.
Do not talk again for 100 hours.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.691
What do we do?
- We team up with Michael.

03:10.774 --> 03:14.612
OK, hot take, but I like your confidence.
Tell me why.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.072
He has a bow tie.
- Oh, no.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.158
I always trust dudes in bow ties.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.744
Once, this guy in a bow tie
came up to me at the gun range

03:21.827 --> 03:25.372
in a Jacksonville bus station
and said he'd give me 600 dollars

03:25.456 --> 03:29.126
if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag
and brought them to Daytona Beach.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.711
I needed money at the time

03:30.836 --> 03:32.880
cos I had just bet my friend Donkey Doug

03:33.047 --> 03:36.884
that I could chug a whole bottle of
Dan Marino cologne and not yarf.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.053
And I lost!

03:39.428 --> 03:41.263
So I put the turties in my bag

03:41.347 --> 03:45.017
I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona
and the guy paid me the 600 dollars.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.938
My point is, you always trust dudes
in bow ties.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.358
Aaaah!

03:52.441 --> 03:54.944
Look, Michael's a liar. I know liars.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.613
It was my job to trick people
into buying fake medicine

03:57.696 --> 03:59.782
and I was the top salesperson
seven years in a row.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.492
I thought you only worked there five years.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.744
Proves my point! This is a trick.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.955
There's no way we trust him.
- I agree.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.498
He could be lying about this whole thing.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.583
For all we know, you three are
in the Bad Place

04:09.667 --> 04:12.127
and I'm up in the Good Place,
where I belong, being tested.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.921
How would that even...?

04:14.213 --> 04:15.589
I don't know but it's possible.

04:15.798 --> 04:18.717
Before we do anything,
we need more information.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.178
We should ask him every question
we can think of.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.596
Yes.
- Yes, we shall grill him

04:22.680 --> 04:24.181
like the flank of an Iberian piglet.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.267
I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours?

04:29.645 --> 04:31.397
OK, man. We got questions.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.066
First off, how can we possibly trust you?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.360
You can't. But you have to.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.654
Logically, you shouldn't
but you have no choice.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.906
I mean, I wouldn't, if I were you.
It's a crazy thing to do.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.492
But you gotta.
- What happens if we don't?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.203
Most likely, I reboot you once more

04:46.620 --> 04:49.123
you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.624
He shuts everything down.

04:50.708 --> 04:56.046
I get punished, you end up spending
the rest of eternity in the real Bad Place

04:56.297 --> 04:59.091
up to your necks
in a volcano full of scorpions.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.594
I'll tell you what I want to know right now
before we go any further.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.806
Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win
the Super Bowl last year?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.644
Oh, you're serious. Uh, no.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.856
Will they ever win the Super Bowl?
- Jason, I can't predict the future.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.692
But no. They won't.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.943
OK, well I just have, like

05:17.985 --> 05:19.778
12 more Jaguar questions--
- No, you don't.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.488
- Hey, Janet?
- Hi, there.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.532
Do you have something shiny
Jason can play with?

05:26.243 --> 05:28.579
How many different versions
of this place have we been through?

05:29.955 --> 05:32.708
Uh, let's see... 802.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.501
The longest one was 11 months.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.755
Uh, this current one has only been
going for one week.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.548
Boy, you guys barely know each other.

05:39.757 --> 05:41.008
It's gonna make this tough.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.593
What's that super tiny line?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.012
That's the shortest one, eight seconds.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.597
It was a butt-reboot.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.599
I sat on the activator by mistake.

05:48.891 --> 05:53.187
Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times?
- Yes, why?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.147
Every time a Janet is rebooted

05:55.230 --> 05:57.858
she increases her social awareness
and abilities.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.028
I might be the most advanced Janet
in the universe.

06:01.111 --> 06:01.987
Oh.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.574
So, Janet isn't with you?

06:05.657 --> 06:06.533
No.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.703
There has to be a Janet
in every Neighbourhood, good and bad.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.916
This one is an actual Good Place Janet
that I stole to help sell the ruse.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.835
I guess it didn't work, though.
Because you keep failing.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.796
Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.506
If you're not human

06:20.547 --> 06:21.548
why do you look like us?

06:21.757 --> 06:24.802
Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau
of Human Affairs

06:25.010 --> 06:27.513
gets randomly assigned a human body

06:27.638 --> 06:30.391
so we can get the feel
of how best to torture you.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.269
I gotta say, it took me a long time
to get used to the hanging bits.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.479
Gross.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.189
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter,
Eleanor.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.899
I was talking about my testicles.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.068
What about soulmates? Are they real?

06:41.360 --> 06:45.406
I don't know. I hope not.
I mean, pretty lame idea, if you ask me.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.075
Mindy St Claire's is fake, I bet.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.368
No, the Medium Place is real.

06:49.451 --> 06:53.372
So annoying how you managed
to slip away from me, all those times.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.333
Why even tell us about any real thing?

06:56.417 --> 06:58.502
Why not just lie about all of it?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.754
Lies are always more convincing
when they're closer to the truth.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.215
That's true. I crashed a lot
of open-bar weddings

07:03.298 --> 07:04.508
as Eileen Shelbourne.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.844
Even dated a groomsman for a few months

07:06.927 --> 07:10.347
so I had to keep the name,
and he got "Eileen" tattooed on his neck.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.598
Seriously?

07:11.682 --> 07:14.351
How are she and I in the same place?
- Oh, get over yourself.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.104
Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.940
We're running out of time,
and I'm your only option.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.986
"We're running out of time
and I'm your only option?"

07:24.194 --> 07:28.824
A lot of guys your age said that to me
just as the bar was about to close.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.117
But I never settled for them.

07:30.451 --> 07:33.579
Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby,
he was obsessed with me

07:33.745 --> 07:36.206
and he never slept because he was
addicted to Adderall.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.042
There is always another option.

07:39.585 --> 07:43.380
And yes, I probably could have just said
that last part but whatever, don't judge me.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.007
You guys do whatever you want.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.216
I'm out.
- No!

07:46.508 --> 07:49.595
My plan only works if all four of you
are on board.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.097
Then you better get cracking
on a new plan, pally

07:52.181 --> 07:55.934
because so far, I haven't heard a single
good reason why I should help you.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.144
Alright, how about this?

07:57.394 --> 08:00.397
You help me trick Vicky
and all those other goons

08:01.773 --> 08:04.485
I can get you to the real Good Place.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.575
There's a way to get to the real Good Place?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.618
It's complicated.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.996
It may take a while to arrange
especially since I'll have to do it

08:16.079 --> 08:20.751
in secret but yes, yes, there is
a potential method of transportation.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.127
Well, is it nice?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.880
Is there a business class?
Can I pre-board?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.632
Yeah, let's not worry about that right now.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.967
I can get us there.
- "Us"?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.846
You, Mr "Diabolical Torture Guy"
are gonna try

08:32.971 --> 08:34.890
to join us in the Good Place?
- Yeah.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.476
If I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.

08:37.559 --> 08:42.105
But if I rescue four pitiful,
foul-smelling humans

08:42.189 --> 08:43.398
from eternal damnation

08:43.690 --> 08:45.526
hit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.

08:45.776 --> 08:49.112
"Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed"
and all that crap

08:50.072 --> 08:51.657
maybe I can earn a spot, too.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.535
We didn't deserve the Good Place
based on our time on Earth.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.911
Will they even let us stay?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.412
I gotta be honest, I have no idea.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.623
But at least if you help me fool Vicky

08:59.706 --> 09:02.793
your brains don't get erased every two weeks.

09:05.796 --> 09:09.049
OK, all humans who have not
already been suckered by Michael

09:09.132 --> 09:10.676
another team meeting.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.970
This is definitely a trap.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.889
We figured out his game every time,
and now he's just trying

09:15.973 --> 09:19.726
a new way to mess with us.
Teaming up with a demon is insane.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.813
Maybe.
But I think we have to do it.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.648
Are you forking kidding me right now?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.692
You take a half an hour to pick out
a turtleneck

09:26.775 --> 09:28.068
and yet this you're sure about?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.404
OK, look, I spent my whole life trying
to learn about right and wrong

09:30.487 --> 09:32.656
and apparently, I failed.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.242
I want us to get better
and I want us to stay that way.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.620
You understand that, right, Tahani?
- I understand nothing.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.124
Hey! Same here!
- Michael, there's been a mistake.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.544
I belong in the Good Place.
The real one with the good people.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.547
Who do I speak to about correcting this?
- Me, and you're wrong.

09:48.964 --> 09:49.840
Very well.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.341
I would like to speak to your manager.

09:51.758 --> 09:56.179
Listen, sweetheart, you've only been
in this timeline for about a week.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.557
So I think I'm gonna fast forward
things a bit.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.518
There's a very good reason
why you ended up here.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.354
You never cared about the people
you were helping.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.900
You did it only for fame or status
or to spite your family.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.154
That is utter tosh! I had my flaws,
just like anyone else

10:12.362 --> 10:14.239
but I raised billions for charity.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.410
I was a good person and I defy you
or anyone else to prove otherwise.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.539
You know, in all the reboots,
I never showed you how you died.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.126
I was saving it in case I ever needed
to really make you miserable.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.919
But it's hilarious.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.588
Of course, I mean sad.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.008
But it might help you come to grips
with who you really were.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.926
Do you want to remember it?

10:38.347 --> 10:41.558
Tahani Al-Jamil, social activist
philanthropist

10:41.642 --> 10:45.103
neck model and now cover girl for
"International Sophisticate Magazine."

10:45.437 --> 10:47.230
The issue hits luxury news stands
this week

10:47.314 --> 10:48.940
and regular news stands
the week after.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.777
Tahani, welcome.
- Oh, it's such an honour.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.738
I have long dreamt of being one
of the women or yachts

10:54.821 --> 10:55.739
who grace your cover.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.407
Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.994
A woman who as you know was offered
the spot on our cover but turned it down.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.664
I actually didn't know that.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.333
Please, carry on.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.543
Well, next week, Kamilah will travel
to Cleveland, Ohio

11:08.627 --> 11:11.838
to become the youngest person ever
inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.173
Remarkable.

11:14.049 --> 11:14.966
Is there a question?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.094
Don't you find that remarkable?

11:18.136 --> 11:20.305
Kamilah is very impressive.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.558
As you know, she released
her debut album only six months ago

11:23.642 --> 11:25.727
and yet, the critics thought
it was so brilliant

11:26.019 --> 11:29.398
that the Hall of Fame decided
to waive its 25-year waiting period.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.401
Sadly, I will not be attending
the ceremony

11:32.484 --> 11:35.737
because I will be in Haiti
on a relief mission.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.573
Perhaps we should talk more about that.
- Perhaps we should.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.659
But first, another question about Kamilah.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.078
Don't you think she
and I would be friends?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.497
We have a lot in common,
we are both Capricorn

11:45.580 --> 11:46.707
and we're both only children.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.961
I'm sorry, I forgot about you.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.929
Hey, can I get an Irish enema?
That's Baileys and Sprite in a ziploc bag.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.515
Excuse me,
do I look like a waitress to you?

12:04.099 --> 12:05.183
Yeah.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.018
Here.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.407
Kamilah! Congratulations.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.284
You have all the attention.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.494
Once again.
- Who are you?

12:25.328 --> 12:27.914
Really?
- Good Lord.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.624
Tahani!

12:30.083 --> 12:32.169
You're a cocktail waitress now.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.379
Honestly, I think
this is the right move for you.

12:34.629 --> 12:38.800
No, it's just that my own sister didn't
even deign to invite me to her little soiree.

12:38.925 --> 12:43.138
So I had to weasel my way
in here like some common... weasel.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.516
I was supposed to be in Haiti
being photographed helping people

12:46.600 --> 12:49.728
but instead I delayed my trip by a day
to come here and tell you off.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.605
No, you came to do
what you always do

12:51.897 --> 12:54.024
make a scene and embarrass yourself.

12:54.232 --> 12:57.402
So I'm just an embarrassment to you?
Is that what you think of me?

12:57.903 --> 13:00.822
Honestly, I don't really think about you.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.449
No! Ow.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.961
That's it. Ah!

13:16.880 --> 13:17.839
I'll bring you down!

13:20.801 --> 13:22.177
Come on.
Come on!

13:22.886 --> 13:24.596
Come down to the ground where you
belong

13:27.766 --> 13:29.226
- Oh, no.
- Mm.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.229
I died in Cleveland?

13:33.146 --> 13:36.191
I don't think that should be
your biggest takeaway from that story.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.734
Is that really all I cared about?

13:37.818 --> 13:40.904
Just outshining my sister
and gaining praise and acclaim?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.241
I mean, I did gain praise and acclaim.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.409
You know, I dare say on some occasions

13:46.785 --> 13:50.789
more praise and acclaim
than my sister, Kamilah, so...

13:53.166 --> 13:54.042
Oh.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.503
Oh, I see.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.423
Oh, God.
- Oh, come on, now.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.176
It's not all bad.
Imagine you're me

14:03.260 --> 14:07.347
and you're designing a torture chamber
for people who think that they belong

14:07.430 --> 14:11.309
in the Good Place.
I mean, you were perfect.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.937
But I've always wanted
to be perfect at something

14:14.020 --> 14:16.189
I just never thought
it would be the perfect stooge.

14:17.858 --> 14:18.942
I want to do it.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.486
I want to become the person
I pretended to be.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.445
I agree with Chidi.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.490
We should team up with Michael
and all try to build a better Tahani.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.994
Great.
Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.621
Because everyone
except Eleanor is an idiot.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.457
Why am I the only person who clearly sees
what's going on here?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.794
It's not that we don't understand the risks,
we just wanna become better people

14:37.878 --> 14:39.087
and this is our best chance.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.883
Oh, I get it.
'Cos you're so much better than me.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.926
That's what this is about?
- Hang on, don't lash out at us

14:45.010 --> 14:46.928
just because of your innate distrust.
- Lash out?

14:47.012 --> 14:48.555
No, it's not about who's better.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.475
I have no idea what's going on
right now, but everyone else is talking

14:52.559 --> 14:54.603
and I think I should, too!

14:54.686 --> 14:55.770
What is so funny?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.564
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.316
How do I explain this?

14:59.774 --> 15:04.112
I'm basically an exterminator,
and you're cockroaches.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.115
My job was to squish you

15:07.574 --> 15:09.993
and poison you and yet, somehow

15:10.285 --> 15:14.831
my very survival now depends on you,
the cockroaches, agreeing to help me.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.335
That's funny.
- We're cockroaches to you?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.545
Yeah. Or dung beetles.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.006
I don't know.
Something small and gross

15:23.381 --> 15:25.300
that creeps on the ground in its own filth.

15:25.967 --> 15:26.968
Just being honest.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.220
OK, OK, OK.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.973
Alright, forget about him.
Forget about him, focus on us.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.643
Kant wrote it is our duty
to improve ourselves.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.687
So whatever Michael's reasons
for doing this, he's giving us

15:37.771 --> 15:40.190
the best chance to improve ourselves.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.361
OK, I have to admit,
you're making a lot of sense right now.

15:44.486 --> 15:50.951
I need to just untangle all of this.
Give me a minute to think about it alone.

15:51.117 --> 15:51.993
OK.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.125
- Janet?
- Hi, there.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.045
Call me a train.
Fill it to the brim with cocaine.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.715
I'm going back to Mindy St. Clair's house.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.349
Gonna bail, huh?
- Hm? No.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.852
- Why... why would you say that?
- Well...

16:17.936 --> 16:21.064
you got a bag full of clothes,
you stuffed a bunch of pillows

16:21.147 --> 16:23.608
and a mop in your bed
to make it look like you're asleep

16:23.733 --> 16:26.069
and you're literally sneaking out
the back gate.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.446
OK.
I'm going to Mindy's.

16:28.738 --> 16:33.159
I don't want to live forever in a boring,
beige house with a weird, horny cokehead

16:33.284 --> 16:34.911
but look at what you're asking me to do.

16:35.036 --> 16:39.833
Make a deal with an actual devil
so that I can then do homework in secret.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.669
And by the way, you're not my friends,
man.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.212
We've known each other for, like, a
week.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.588
You know it's more than that.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.175
We've been through some version
of this 800 different times.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.511
And who cares that it's only been a week?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.930
How long do you have to know someone
before you do the right thing?

16:54.305 --> 16:57.726
Nine weeks, minimum.
- OK.

16:57.892 --> 17:02.188
Look, bro, I don't owe you anything.
I gotta do what's right for me.

17:04.232 --> 17:07.318
You can come with me if you want.
I got another mop we can put in the bed.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.154
Good luck.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.168
I got a couple more questions.
- Sure.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.670
Take your time.
We're not in a hurry or anything.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.591
How many times in all the reboots
did I ask Chidi for help

17:29.674 --> 17:32.302
he refused to help me,
and then I had to get better on my own?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.304
Never.
He always helped you.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.556
God. Really?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.933
Yep. No matter how I set it up

17:39.350 --> 17:41.811
you found him,
confessed you didn't belong

17:41.978 --> 17:44.105
asked him for help,
and he said yes.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.192
Now his agreeing to help
was part of my plan.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.987
What wasn't part of my plan
was it actually working.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.990
Drove me nuts.
Pesky little nerd.

17:54.199 --> 17:58.203
Stuck with you and always helped you
overcome your biggest problem.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.790
Assuming that's my selfishness.
- No.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.250
No, no, no.
It's that you never found a haircut

18:04.793 --> 18:08.963
that framed your face properly.
Yes, your selfishness.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.840
I'm not that selfish.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.258
Eleanor, your cocaine

18:12.342 --> 18:13.843
and escape train are ready.
- Not now.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.220
OK.

18:19.891 --> 18:20.975
I think Michael is a liar.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.561
I think there's a 99% chance
he's forking with us.

18:23.812 --> 18:27.107
But he's asking us for help,
so we should help him.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.025
Because that's what Chidi would do.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.112
That's what Chidi would do for me
or for any of us.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.156
It's what I am doing.
- I know.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.909
It's just you're talking about me
like I'm not here or something

18:37.992 --> 18:40.453
and that just makes me feel weird.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.497
Alright.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.541
We're all in.
We'll help you.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.378
You finally listened to reason.
- On one condition.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.049
You wanna be on our team,
you gotta be on our team.

18:53.174 --> 18:57.011
Which means the professor over here
is gonna give us all lessons

18:57.095 --> 18:59.889
on how to be better people.
Including you.

19:00.014 --> 19:04.144
Oh, no.
No, I won't be taking any classes.

19:04.686 --> 19:08.690
I'm an immortal being with abilities
you can only dream

19:08.815 --> 19:11.526
Yeah, and we're in Arizona, dirtbag.

19:11.693 --> 19:15.238
A human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster

19:15.405 --> 19:18.074
and literally the dumbest person
I've ever met.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.077
And who am I? Describe me now.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.371
We are all going to take classes.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.375
We are all going to improve.
And the second you betray us

19:27.458 --> 19:30.962
I walk into Vicky's stinky
chowder restaurant and tell her everything.

19:31.254 --> 19:35.925
You agree to those terms,
and you can join us on Team Cockroach.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.554
So what's it gonna be?
You're running out of time.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.015
And we're your only option.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.228
So it's all frozen yogurt places now, huh?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.522
Yeah, yogurt was what we started with.

19:49.606 --> 19:54.777
A lot of us like the first version best
so we went back to 322

19:54.861 --> 19:58.990
perfectly matched human souls,
blended together in a blissful

19:59.073 --> 20:02.785
harmonic balance.
- Well done.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.331
I've only given this opening day tour
to you like, 800 times.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.167
Hey, how's this for my
oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face?

20:10.668 --> 20:13.296
Not bad.
- Right? I'm a pretty good liar.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.048
You really are.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.133
I've always admired that about you.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.343
Thank you, Michael.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.389
Now I wanna introduce someone
that you're gonna get to know very well.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.017
She was the top point getter,
so she'll be helping me out

20:26.100 --> 20:28.269
around the Neighbourhood,
kind of like your mayor.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.063
Vicky Sengupta!

20:32.148 --> 20:33.733
Vicky, would you like to say a few words?

20:33.983 --> 20:37.737
Actually, Michael,
I'd like to sing a few words. Janet.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.905
Hit it!

20:42.742 --> 20:45.912

21:17.902 --> 21:19.654
I don't know
how long I can keep this up.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.406
I nearly cracked about 50 times.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.825
What are you talking about,
so far this reboot is dope.

21:23.908 --> 21:27.328
There's fro-yo, there's fro-yo toppings and--

21:27.620 --> 21:28.621
Oh, spoons!

21:29.455 --> 21:30.331
Alright.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.834
We should have a few hours to ourselves.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.421
Vicky's working on her performance
for the welcome party tonight.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.841
It looks like pretending to enjoy
her singing is gonna be half our job here.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.135
I got her to tell me
how she was gonna torture you

21:42.302 --> 21:43.636
at the party, which is basically

21:43.720 --> 21:45.054
the same way I did.

21:45.388 --> 21:50.435
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp,
insults people, etcetera.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.563
Whatever bad stuff you do
becomes the basis

21:53.646 --> 21:56.065
for the chaos tomorrow morning.
- OK, OK.

21:56.149 --> 22:00.069
So my job is to get drunk and insult people.
I think I can hack that.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.822
Now, Chidi, I'm gonna need you
to act nervous

22:02.989 --> 22:05.908
and embarrassed by Eleanor.
- Way ahead of you.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.244
Tahani, just be your fabulous self.

22:08.328 --> 22:12.040
And Jason, you're good old silent
Jianyu the monk.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.336
So I told Vicky that I would handle
the surveillance on the four of you.

22:16.794 --> 22:20.840
That'll let us meet each day
for Chidi's ethics lessons

22:20.965 --> 22:23.134
which will apparently include me.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.261
Even though that's transparently insane.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.723
Cool. And, um, Janet
you're not gonna rat us out, right?

22:28.973 --> 22:34.145
Well, Jason I've been thinking about this
a lot over the last 1.3 milliseconds

22:34.604 --> 22:38.524
I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose
is to make humans happy.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.319
And since you're the only
actual humans here

22:41.444 --> 22:44.489
I'm on board for whatever fun little
schemes you guys come up with.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.991
OK, bring it in.
Team huddle.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.913
The Bad Place is about to be
outsmarted by a cowardly traitor

22:52.497 --> 22:55.208
four dum-dums, and a robot.
- Not a robot.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.668
We can do this.
Team Cockroach on three.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.045
One, two, three.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.464
- Team Cockroach!
- Bobcats!

23:02.507 --> 23:03.966
I still think that's better.
