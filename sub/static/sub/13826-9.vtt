NARRATOR: Ancient prophecy foretold
that the beloved Princess Demurra,

00:55.055 --> 00:58.100
would be kidnapped by King Draykor
the evil Dragon King

00:58.183 --> 01:01.645

to his labyrinth of delusion.

And now, only one hero can rescue her.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.984
Her one true love.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.694
And once he saves her,

01:08.777 --> 01:10.529
they will live happily ever after.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.157
And use their compatible features
to produce many attractive offspring

01:14.283 --> 01:16.285
who will also live happily ever after.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.452

will you help me save her

01:28.797 --> 01:30.507
