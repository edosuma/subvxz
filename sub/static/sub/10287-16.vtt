00:49.270 --> 00:51.135
I guess he didn't hear, sir.

00:51.306 --> 00:55.436
The sun is shining, the birds are singing
and IBM just doubled its pretax revenues.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.237
No kidding. That's great.

00:57.412 --> 01:00.472

- Hey, I didn't know you were a stockholder.

01:00.648 --> 01:01.740
Yeah, I got a share.

01:02.684 --> 01:06.313
One share? You're so cute.

01:06.488 --> 01:08.217
Well, I just like to dabble a little.

01:08.390 --> 01:12.053
Hey, don't dabble. Diversify, like me.

01:12.227 --> 01:14.320
I have leaseback arrangements
on private jets.

01:14.496 --> 01:16.964
I've got foreign exclusions
on Brazilian condos.

01:17.132 --> 01:19.657
My portfolio just topped 75 thou.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.768

I'm not worried, though, you know.
I've covered myself pretty well.

You know, I bet the queen
doesn't even appreciate scat.

about something, sir?

nasty things on that first bench over there.

- Yeah.

Don't, Herb. You'll make it worse.

How can I make it worse, Norma?

extenuating circumstances here.

Obviously?

Madam Loretta persuaded my client's wife
that there was trouble with their marriage.

I never persuade, I reveal.

04:50.245 --> 04:53.442

was in her fourth house.

in your house when I get through with you.

- Mr. Gilpin...
- And the choking man...

- I did it for us, Herb.
- Us?

The more, the merrier.

05:04.926 --> 05:07.258
Our marriage was in the toilet, Herb.

It seemed lost.

I wanted us to be happy again.
I wanted peace, I wanted love.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.995

is a little communication.

05:19.741 --> 05:21.003
There was a curse.

- Oh, yes.

on our 20th anniversary, it happened.

Simple spells you can weave
around your own house.

to Epcot Center on voodoo.

is that you make your own magic.
