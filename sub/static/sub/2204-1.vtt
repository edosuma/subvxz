00:42.290 --> 00:44.166
Well?

00:44.250 --> 00:47.629
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

00:53.843 --> 00:56.387
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

01:17.491 --> 01:20.120
I just sent it. You should have it.

01:20.203 --> 01:23.624
- Yes. Thank you.
- Are you sure this is legal?

01:23.707 --> 01:27.211
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

01:27.294 --> 01:30.797
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

01:30.881 --> 01:32.925
- To you?
- We have all we need.

01:43.727 --> 01:44.811
We're ready.

01:54.196 --> 01:57.783
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

02:04.248 --> 02:06.458
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

02:06.542 --> 02:09.502
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

02:44.539 --> 02:48.543
FBI CYBER-SECURITY DIVISION
WASHINGTON, D.C.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.618
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.621
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

03:24.704 --> 03:27.498
but they definitely cracked our door.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.876
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.963
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

03:34.047 --> 03:39.135
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

03:39.219 --> 03:43.223
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it happened to us. Do it.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.892
Sir, it's night.
They're all over the country.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.853
Get local law enforcement help.

03:47.937 --> 03:53.150
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.470
- Jim. I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

04:22.346 --> 04:23.639
- Get out.
- What?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.933
- Get out of the car now.
- Don't touch me.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.893
- No means no.
- What are you doin'

04:27.977 --> 04:31.438
- John, stop it.
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.149
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.944
Dad. Stop it. I mean it.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.072
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

04:40.823 --> 04:43.951
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.912
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.291
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.501
- No.
- Yeah.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.338
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.300
What are you doing here?

04:59.383 --> 05:03.221
- You don't answer your phone, return calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

05:03.305 --> 05:08.018
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

05:08.101 --> 05:12.856
How about stuff like this: You spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

05:12.939 --> 05:14.941
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not.

05:15.025 --> 05:18.028
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

05:19.988 --> 05:22.407
You are such an asshole.

05:23.700 --> 05:30.081
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

05:31.958 --> 05:35.879
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

05:35.962 --> 05:38.340
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

05:38.423 --> 05:41.134
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

05:41.218 --> 05:44.763
Damn right you're going to bed alone.

05:45.305 --> 05:48.850
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

05:48.934 --> 05:51.853
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

05:52.270 --> 05:54.272
if I wanna talk to you -

05:55.982 --> 05:57.901
I'll call you.

05:57.984 --> 06:01.279
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.

06:01.363 --> 06:05.075
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

06:07.619 --> 06:09.704
Chicks, right?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.378
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

06:43.823 --> 06:45.992
John?

06:46.075 --> 06:48.494
John? It's Sclavino.

06:50.204 --> 06:54.041
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

06:54.125 --> 06:57.587
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

06:57.670 --> 07:02.049
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

07:02.133 --> 07:05.386
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

07:05.469 --> 07:07.847
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

07:07.930 --> 07:12.351
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

07:12.435 --> 07:15.563
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

07:15.646 --> 07:18.524
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

07:18.608 --> 07:22.028
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

07:22.111 --> 07:25.072
Send ajughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

07:25.156 --> 07:29.661
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

07:29.745 --> 07:32.247
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

07:32.331 --> 07:36.001
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

07:36.084 --> 07:39.963
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

07:40.047 --> 07:42.007
Great.

07:42.090 --> 07:47.262
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

07:47.346 --> 07:49.139
You owe me one, Jack.

08:43.111 --> 08:44.153
What?

08:54.622 --> 08:56.583
Aw, come on.

09:03.715 --> 09:05.592
Goddammit.

09:18.855 --> 09:21.608
PLAN B. WE DO IT OURSELVES.

09:28.990 --> 09:33.161
- Who is it?
- NYPD. Open the door, please.

09:40.043 --> 09:42.462
- Hi.
- NYPD?

09:42.545 --> 09:47.342
OK. I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

09:47.425 --> 09:51.221
I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

09:51.304 --> 09:54.599
No. He actually does not live here any more.

09:54.682 --> 09:58.312
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

09:58.395 --> 10:03.901
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

10:03.984 --> 10:07.821
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

10:11.200 --> 10:16.247
"Detective". Yeah, that looks real.
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

10:16.330 --> 10:21.043
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.

10:22.002 --> 10:26.423
Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of
the <i>Kill Zone Nine.</i> Wanna check it out?

10:26.507 --> 10:30.970
No. Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.181
Open the door.

10:34.265 --> 10:35.683
Shit.

10:42.022 --> 10:44.525
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

10:44.608 --> 10:47.861
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

10:47.945 --> 10:50.948
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

10:51.448 --> 10:54.451
- Feds?
- Yeah. The feds.

11:02.167 --> 11:06.630
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

11:06.714 --> 11:08.507
Such a pain in the ass.

11:08.591 --> 11:11.011
You play with dolls?

11:11.094 --> 11:13.471
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a GI Joe?

11:13.555 --> 11:16.641
No, it's not. It's a limited edition,

11:16.725 --> 11:17.517
and...

11:17.601 --> 11:21.271
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

11:21.354 --> 11:25.275
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

11:25.358 --> 11:27.611
I got some other cool shit you can break.

11:27.694 --> 11:31.531
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

11:34.159 --> 11:37.787
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls.

11:40.457 --> 11:42.626
Are you really trying to escape?

11:43.460 --> 11:45.128
Jesus, don't shoot.

11:45.212 --> 11:46.630
Get down.

11:53.094 --> 11:55.388
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

12:12.239 --> 12:13.198
Go.

12:13.281 --> 12:17.035
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low. Stay down.

12:17.118 --> 12:18.787
Come on.

12:26.629 --> 12:30.466
It's all right. Stay low, all right? Stay down.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.970
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.600
OK.

12:55.491 --> 12:57.493
That'll wake the neighbours.

12:58.703 --> 13:00.580
Get down. Get inside.

13:04.625 --> 13:07.545
They're back in the room.
They're back in the room.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.385
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now.

13:14.468 --> 13:16.095
- I'm trying to...
- Now.

13:55.761 --> 13:57.304
Get back in there.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.355
Get ready to run.

15:22.682 --> 15:25.935
- What the hell was that?
- What?

15:26.019 --> 15:29.022
- Did you do that?
- No.

15:29.105 --> 15:32.066
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

15:32.150 --> 15:36.696
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

15:38.448 --> 15:41.784
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit.

15:43.286 --> 15:45.330
Come on.

15:45.413 --> 15:47.415
Watch it. Slow it down.

15:47.498 --> 15:51.252
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:51.336 --> 15:53.671
Let's go. Come on.

15:55.131 --> 15:57.467
Come on, come on. Stay close.

16:08.896 --> 16:11.565
Stay with me. Stay with me.

16:14.652 --> 16:16.862
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

16:19.031 --> 16:21.617
Get in the car. Go, go.

16:28.249 --> 16:30.501
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

16:30.584 --> 16:32.878
- Can you reload a gun?
- I...

16:33.963 --> 16:37.132
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now.

16:41.845 --> 16:44.265
Grab the gun from the back seat.

17:04.034 --> 17:05.618
You OK?

17:14.627 --> 17:16.922
Get your head down.

17:19.508 --> 17:21.803
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

17:31.938 --> 17:34.232
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

17:36.693 --> 17:41.489
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

17:41.573 --> 17:42.991
Go ahead.

17:43.074 --> 17:46.953
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

17:47.037 --> 17:48.538
Stand by.

17:48.622 --> 17:53.043
- This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

17:53.126 --> 17:57.505
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in yourjurisdiction.

18:13.230 --> 18:14.272
YOU TELL HER.

18:17.901 --> 18:20.237
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

18:20.654 --> 18:22.155
WE DIDN'T GET HIM.

18:22.697 --> 18:24.157
THREE OF OUR MEN ARE DOWN.

18:26.076 --> 18:27.494
Wait one.

18:48.432 --> 18:53.771
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

18:55.106 --> 18:57.525
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

18:57.608 --> 18:59.986
I did send five of you, is that right?

19:01.821 --> 19:06.742
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

19:11.455 --> 19:14.625
- Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

19:14.709 --> 19:18.129
I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.

19:18.212 --> 19:21.090
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

19:21.173 --> 19:25.344
Yeah, I'm scared.
Weren't you scared, back there?

19:25.428 --> 19:28.639
Yeah. I was scared.

19:28.723 --> 19:33.436
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.

19:33.519 --> 19:35.771
Have you done stuff like that before?

19:35.855 --> 19:39.525
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

19:41.235 --> 19:44.780
Yeah. But not for a long time.

19:45.781 --> 19:48.994
So who were those guys?
Why were they trying to kill you?

19:49.077 --> 19:52.497
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

19:52.581 --> 19:55.542
They were there to kill you.

19:55.626 --> 20:00.797
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

20:15.979 --> 20:19.858
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

20:19.942 --> 20:23.654
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

20:28.158 --> 20:31.495
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.413
On it.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.918
What's with all the guns?

20:38.418 --> 20:40.712
Operational prudence.

20:41.296 --> 20:45.342
Think of them as hardware to your software.

20:55.978 --> 21:00.774
Good morning, DC. It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

21:00.857 --> 21:05.697
If you've got any big plans, get started
early, cos the traffic is ramping up.

21:05.780 --> 21:09.492
So here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

21:11.619 --> 21:14.330
What? What... What...

21:14.414 --> 21:16.708
What are you doing? What is that?

21:16.791 --> 21:18.751
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

21:18.835 --> 21:23.006
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

21:23.089 --> 21:26.342
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

21:26.426 --> 21:29.387
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

21:29.470 --> 21:32.640
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

21:33.308 --> 21:36.561
OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

21:36.644 --> 21:38.605
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

21:41.274 --> 21:44.527
We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.658
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

21:51.451 --> 21:54.454
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

21:54.537 --> 21:56.581
Begin stage one.

22:14.015 --> 22:15.684
What? Nothing.

22:29.531 --> 22:35.287
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

22:35.371 --> 22:39.458
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

22:39.541 --> 22:42.503
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

22:42.586 --> 22:44.505
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'

22:44.588 --> 22:49.927
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

22:50.010 --> 22:52.388
Hold on. You listen to the news?

22:52.471 --> 22:55.558
You got a problem with the news now?

22:55.641 --> 22:58.686
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

22:58.769 --> 23:02.481
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

23:02.565 --> 23:05.776
Everything you hear, every single day,

23:05.859 --> 23:11.031
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: To keep you living in fear.

23:11.115 --> 23:12.992
- Fear?
- Total fear.

23:13.075 --> 23:17.204
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

23:17.288 --> 23:20.040
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

23:20.124 --> 23:24.169
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

23:24.253 --> 23:26.338
I'll drop a bomb on you...

23:26.422 --> 23:28.173
- What?
- Shut up.

23:28.257 --> 23:31.636
That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

24:23.355 --> 24:26.066
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.736
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

24:31.947 --> 24:34.074
Hey, man. Hey.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.827
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.913
OK.

24:41.331 --> 24:42.791
Jesus Christ.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.524
All the lights are green.

25:06.607 --> 25:09.277
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.488
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

25:14.615 --> 25:17.368
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

25:17.451 --> 25:19.787
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

25:19.870 --> 25:21.706
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

25:21.789 --> 25:22.999
What are we doing?

25:23.082 --> 25:27.712
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

25:37.054 --> 25:41.183
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the el train network.

25:44.979 --> 25:48.107
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

25:48.190 --> 25:52.445
FAAjust issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

25:52.528 --> 25:54.530
We're under attack.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.994
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

26:10.088 --> 26:12.299
That's the anthrax alarm.

26:14.176 --> 26:17.095
All right, everyone out. Now. Now.

26:19.848 --> 26:22.893
Taylor, move. Go. Move.

26:37.574 --> 26:42.955
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

26:43.038 --> 26:45.040
This is not a drill.

26:45.123 --> 26:51.129
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

27:10.357 --> 27:11.985
We need you inside, sir.

27:18.116 --> 27:22.787
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

27:25.039 --> 27:26.624
We gotta know what's there.

27:26.708 --> 27:30.128
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to ID the point of origin.

27:33.131 --> 27:35.216
Begin stage two.

27:41.389 --> 27:44.475
What's going on?

27:50.523 --> 27:53.109
They're already starting to panic.

27:56.070 --> 27:58.281
Of course they are.

27:58.364 --> 28:00.909
They think that someone's
taking their money.

28:00.992 --> 28:04.746
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

28:04.829 --> 28:07.874
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.877
Prep the video package.

28:23.431 --> 28:28.604
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

28:28.687 --> 28:33.484
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

28:33.567 --> 28:37.988
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

28:38.614 --> 28:41.909
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

28:41.992 --> 28:46.121
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

28:46.205 --> 28:49.333
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

28:49.416 --> 28:50.626
I'm Bowman.

28:56.507 --> 28:59.385
Video package is ready for upload.

29:02.805 --> 29:05.182
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

29:05.266 --> 29:08.269
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

29:08.352 --> 29:12.523
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

29:12.606 --> 29:15.109
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

29:15.192 --> 29:17.486
- Sir?
- No?

29:21.115 --> 29:26.078
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

29:26.161 --> 29:29.248
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

29:29.331 --> 29:32.251
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

29:32.334 --> 29:35.713
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

29:35.796 --> 29:38.925
Man, that is all bad.

29:39.009 --> 29:43.179
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

29:43.972 --> 29:45.932
- These your suspects?
- Were.

29:46.016 --> 29:48.643
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

29:50.562 --> 29:53.064
Recognise any of these people?

29:54.566 --> 29:55.901
No.

29:55.984 --> 29:57.777
Not one?

29:57.861 --> 30:00.780
Sir, we got a system error.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.836
- My fellow Americans...
...it is time to...

30:14.920 --> 30:18.048
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

30:19.090 --> 30:21.593
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

30:21.676 --> 30:24.679
...what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

30:24.763 --> 30:27.557
- The answer is...
...nothing whatsoever.

30:27.641 --> 30:31.144
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

30:31.228 --> 30:32.520
...useless.

30:33.230 --> 30:36.149
Read my lips.

30:36.650 --> 30:41.613
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

30:41.696 --> 30:44.366
has come to... an end.

30:44.449 --> 30:48.620
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

30:48.703 --> 30:52.833
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

30:52.917 --> 30:55.962
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

30:56.587 --> 31:00.883
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

31:00.967 --> 31:04.470
We will not tire, we will not falter,

31:04.554 --> 31:06.347
and we will not fail.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.183
I don't know how they're getting in.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.142
Thank you.

31:10.226 --> 31:13.020
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

31:16.774 --> 31:18.609
That was creepy.

31:18.693 --> 31:20.570
I tried to find more Nixon.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.281
Think they bought it?

31:23.364 --> 31:25.408
Absolutely.

31:28.077 --> 31:31.289
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

31:31.372 --> 31:34.166
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

31:35.042 --> 31:38.129
It's a fire sale.

31:38.212 --> 31:40.798
- We don't know that yet.
- It's a myth, anyway.

31:40.881 --> 31:45.303
It's a myth? Really? Please tell me
she's actually not in charge of anything.

31:45.386 --> 31:47.346
What's a fire sale?

31:47.430 --> 31:51.893
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

31:51.976 --> 31:56.355
Step one: Take out transportation.
Step two: The financial base and telecoms.

31:56.439 --> 32:00.359
Step three: Get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water electric, nuclear...

32:00.443 --> 32:04.906
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

32:04.989 --> 32:08.076
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.662
Listen. What's your name? Farrell?

32:10.746 --> 32:14.917
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.046
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

32:19.129 --> 32:21.465
No, man. I'm just saying...

32:21.548 --> 32:24.176
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

32:24.259 --> 32:27.221
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

32:27.304 --> 32:31.141
Nothing. I said I understand.

32:31.225 --> 32:36.647
They didn't send the girl scouts out to get this
kid. They sent professionals, full tactical gear.

32:36.730 --> 32:42.444
They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

32:42.527 --> 32:44.780
but somebody wants this kid dead,

32:44.863 --> 32:49.076
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

32:49.159 --> 32:52.621
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.624
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

32:55.707 --> 33:01.088
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

33:01.171 --> 33:04.258
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

33:04.883 --> 33:07.302
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

33:07.386 --> 33:11.014
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

33:11.098 --> 33:15.602
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

33:15.686 --> 33:20.232
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

33:20.316 --> 33:25.738
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

33:25.822 --> 33:30.493
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

33:30.577 --> 33:34.831
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

33:57.896 --> 34:00.523
How long till we get to DHS?

34:00.607 --> 34:05.403
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

34:05.486 --> 34:08.447
DC Metro, this is the FBI
requesting you to clear a route...

34:12.368 --> 34:14.495
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

34:15.371 --> 34:17.665
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

34:17.748 --> 34:20.543
- Close that loop, now.
- Isolate the frequency.

34:20.627 --> 34:25.130
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

34:25.214 --> 34:28.342
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

34:32.513 --> 34:36.518
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

34:36.601 --> 34:38.771
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

34:38.853 --> 34:42.065
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

34:42.149 --> 34:44.944
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

34:45.027 --> 34:47.404
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

34:47.487 --> 34:49.864
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.576
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

34:52.659 --> 34:55.871
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

34:58.707 --> 35:01.418
OK. OK, OK.

35:03.671 --> 35:06.799
They were my competition.

35:09.176 --> 35:11.679
Make the next right onto Concord.

35:11.762 --> 35:15.099
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

35:15.182 --> 35:17.601
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

35:17.685 --> 35:21.146
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

35:25.442 --> 35:30.114
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

35:30.197 --> 35:34.285
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

35:34.368 --> 35:38.998
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

35:39.081 --> 35:41.542
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

35:41.625 --> 35:47.047
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

35:47.631 --> 35:50.135
an accessory to Armageddon.

35:50.719 --> 35:52.721
Take the next left at Lexington.

35:52.804 --> 35:56.975
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

35:57.058 --> 35:58.727
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

35:58.810 --> 36:01.938
Clear a route for two FBI vehicles
approaching on Concord.

36:02.022 --> 36:03.315
Copy, dispatch.

36:03.398 --> 36:04.858
That's her.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.985
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

36:09.112 --> 36:11.406
- It's them.
- You're saying it's "them" them?

36:11.489 --> 36:15.410
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

36:16.494 --> 36:20.999
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

36:21.082 --> 36:23.668
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

36:23.752 --> 36:28.173
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s.

36:28.256 --> 36:31.259
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

36:32.427 --> 36:36.556
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

36:36.640 --> 36:40.101
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

36:42.395 --> 36:45.690
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

36:54.491 --> 36:58.495
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

36:58.578 --> 37:03.793
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

37:03.876 --> 37:07.213
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

37:07.296 --> 37:09.423
Your address in Brooklyn,

37:09.507 --> 37:14.178
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

37:14.262 --> 37:16.013
And how's Holly?

37:16.097 --> 37:20.351
That's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

37:22.353 --> 37:28.442
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

37:28.526 --> 37:30.653
And it gets worse.

37:32.947 --> 37:36.033
Your 401k no longer exists.

37:36.117 --> 37:40.538
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

37:40.621 --> 37:43.708
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

37:43.791 --> 37:46.502
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

37:46.586 --> 37:52.174
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

37:52.258 --> 37:55.845
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

37:55.928 --> 37:59.056
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

38:00.057 --> 38:04.395
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

38:04.478 --> 38:06.314
You're gonna lose.

38:06.397 --> 38:10.276
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

38:10.359 --> 38:13.946
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

38:14.030 --> 38:16.325
Hold your position.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.746
He's not responding.

38:23.665 --> 38:26.293
Get down. Get right down.

38:31.089 --> 38:32.883
Just stay down.

38:36.762 --> 38:40.432
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.827
Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.

39:02.829 --> 39:06.041
Goddammit. Just stay down!

39:11.546 --> 39:13.840
Get down. Just hang on.

39:24.017 --> 39:27.938
Base, we've got a squad car under fire.
We need backup.

39:28.021 --> 39:30.692
This is base. We're sending backup.

39:35.196 --> 39:37.490
Just brace yourself.

39:52.714 --> 39:53.840
Hang on.

40:10.607 --> 40:12.150
Hang on.

40:21.910 --> 40:23.536
Yeah!

40:28.583 --> 40:31.711
- We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

40:41.179 --> 40:42.931
- They're back.
- I know.

40:46.101 --> 40:47.686
Take the tunnel. Left.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.778
God, what are you... Oh, God!

41:04.620 --> 41:06.747
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.374
The tunnel!

41:17.841 --> 41:21.387
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

41:27.476 --> 41:29.478
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.331
- Now open the other side.
- What?

41:49.415 --> 41:50.708
Move.

41:54.962 --> 41:56.338
Hang onto something.

42:33.293 --> 42:36.671
Don't get out of the car. Don't...

42:43.428 --> 42:45.680
Just stay there. Stand still.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.068
Run. Run.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.201
Oh, God.

43:11.791 --> 43:13.542
Don't hesitate like that again.

43:13.626 --> 43:15.461
Can you help me get my wife...

43:15.544 --> 43:18.005
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:18.089 --> 43:22.134
- You OK?
- I can't move my arms.

43:22.218 --> 43:25.429
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?

43:25.513 --> 43:28.182
"It can't be a uniform, John. No."

43:28.933 --> 43:32.812
Get over to the wall, sir.
"Feds called in a favour."

43:34.272 --> 43:40.111
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

43:40.194 --> 43:44.657
"How hard can that be?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

43:44.740 --> 43:48.452
"No, gotta be a senior detective."

43:52.582 --> 43:56.836
Think a traffic jam,
throwing a car at me's gonna stop me?

43:56.919 --> 43:59.088
Rand, get in there and get it done.

43:59.171 --> 44:01.132
WE DON'T HAVE TO. HE'S COMING TO US.

44:13.227 --> 44:15.479
This is not a good idea.

44:53.727 --> 44:56.521
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

44:56.605 --> 44:58.857
Are you OK? Oh, my God.

45:01.652 --> 45:05.364
- Pretty lucky shot.
- Yeah, lucky. That was...

45:05.447 --> 45:07.699
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

45:07.783 --> 45:09.910
I was out of bullets.

45:12.788 --> 45:16.833
- How you doin'
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

45:18.335 --> 45:23.799
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

45:33.392 --> 45:35.477
Rand, check in.

45:36.770 --> 45:37.980
THE CHOPPER'S DOWN.

45:38.063 --> 45:40.775
What about Farrell and McClane?

45:41.651 --> 45:42.902
THEY'R E HISTORY.

45:43.236 --> 45:44.362
Come back in.

45:44.445 --> 45:46.573
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

45:46.656 --> 45:50.118
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

45:50.201 --> 45:54.581
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

46:01.462 --> 46:03.506
ID, sir.

46:04.048 --> 46:06.384
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

46:06.467 --> 46:08.886
Man the gate. You're with me.

46:15.560 --> 46:21.524
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

46:21.608 --> 46:25.778
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

46:31.618 --> 46:35.496
Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.

46:50.303 --> 46:52.096
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

47:01.857 --> 47:02.942
OK, we are in.

47:37.810 --> 47:39.019
This is insane.

47:39.103 --> 47:42.064
This is absurd.

47:42.147 --> 47:47.486
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

47:48.028 --> 47:50.114
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

47:50.197 --> 47:52.199
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No.

47:52.283 --> 47:53.576
Come on.

47:53.659 --> 47:56.203
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

48:24.566 --> 48:26.943
He's in.

48:27.027 --> 48:29.821
Get outta the way.
Make a hole, please. Come on.

48:29.905 --> 48:34.451
Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on.

48:34.534 --> 48:37.621
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

48:43.168 --> 48:44.961
Excuse me. Thanks.

48:45.045 --> 48:47.464
NYPD. NYPD.

48:47.547 --> 48:49.633
Coming through.

48:49.716 --> 48:50.926
Sergeant?

48:51.009 --> 48:54.012
Sergeant. I need to speak to you.

48:54.095 --> 48:59.017
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

48:59.100 --> 49:01.478
Just give me a minute.

49:01.561 --> 49:03.897
Sergeant.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.402
Oh, my God.

49:15.283 --> 49:17.869
Let's get outta here.

49:31.509 --> 49:33.427
We're a go.

49:33.511 --> 49:35.596
Launch the downloads.

49:45.189 --> 49:48.025
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

49:49.986 --> 49:53.573
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

49:58.619 --> 50:01.080
See? There you go.

50:02.873 --> 50:05.793
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

50:08.004 --> 50:10.298
I need you to please remain calm.

50:13.009 --> 50:15.094
Excuse me.

50:16.137 --> 50:20.308
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Holy shit.

50:20.391 --> 50:22.643
- Kid? Kid, hey.
- Yeah, yeah.

50:22.727 --> 50:25.271
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

50:25.354 --> 50:27.356
Come on. Let's go.

50:30.651 --> 50:35.073
And here you go, Agent Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

50:56.845 --> 51:00.015
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

51:00.098 --> 51:03.185
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

51:18.033 --> 51:22.996
Due to recent activity, law enforcement
agencies are being cautious.

51:23.080 --> 51:27.542
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

51:27.626 --> 51:31.630
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

51:31.713 --> 51:35.175
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

51:35.259 --> 51:37.636
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

51:37.719 --> 51:40.138
- FAAjust grounded all flights.
- Good.

51:40.222 --> 51:45.769
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

51:45.852 --> 51:48.063
- Excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

51:48.146 --> 51:51.901
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

51:51.985 --> 51:55.905
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

51:55.989 --> 52:00.743
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

52:00.827 --> 52:06.082
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.

52:06.165 --> 52:09.377
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

52:31.941 --> 52:34.819
- Wait. No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

52:34.903 --> 52:38.615
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

52:38.698 --> 52:40.491
- You sure?
- Yes.

52:40.575 --> 52:43.828
Or smash it. You didn't have to smash it.

52:43.912 --> 52:46.664
Excuse me. It's a police emergency.

52:46.748 --> 52:49.792
He'll call you right back.

52:49.876 --> 52:52.629
Here, right in here. Come here.

52:52.712 --> 52:54.547
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

52:56.132 --> 52:59.302
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

52:59.385 --> 53:01.679
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

53:03.015 --> 53:05.267
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

53:05.351 --> 53:08.145
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

53:10.731 --> 53:13.609
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

53:13.692 --> 53:15.778
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

53:15.861 --> 53:17.947
Yeah, I'll hold on.

53:22.534 --> 53:24.161
Another day in paradise.

53:24.245 --> 53:29.458
They just swarmed into everything -
the telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

53:41.887 --> 53:44.390
They're blanketing every station.

54:10.791 --> 54:14.920
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

54:15.004 --> 54:19.134
Been this way for a few minutes now.

54:34.482 --> 54:36.443
Oh, my God.

54:44.367 --> 54:46.077
McClane.

54:46.995 --> 54:48.121
Look out.

54:48.288 --> 54:49.789
Look out.

54:51.041 --> 54:52.584
Look out.

54:54.210 --> 54:56.379
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

54:56.463 --> 54:58.798
Bowman, it's a fake.

55:02.928 --> 55:04.596
I see it.

55:05.472 --> 55:07.474
Thank God.

55:08.934 --> 55:10.769
Shit.

55:10.852 --> 55:12.687
- McClane?
- Bowman.

55:18.401 --> 55:20.737
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

55:36.045 --> 55:41.509
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

55:41.592 --> 55:43.719
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

55:43.803 --> 55:46.514
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

55:46.597 --> 55:50.601
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

55:50.685 --> 55:56.482
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

55:56.566 --> 55:59.986
It's not a system. It's a country.

56:00.069 --> 56:03.364
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

56:03.447 --> 56:06.993
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

56:07.076 --> 56:13.332
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

56:13.416 --> 56:17.420
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

56:18.546 --> 56:22.300
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

56:22.383 --> 56:28.180
OK, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

56:28.264 --> 56:33.269
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

56:33.352 --> 56:37.231
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

56:37.315 --> 56:41.485
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

56:41.569 --> 56:43.404
And...

56:44.323 --> 56:46.867
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

56:46.950 --> 56:52.539
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

56:52.623 --> 56:57.210
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

56:57.294 --> 56:59.046
How do you know all this stuff?

56:59.129 --> 57:03.467
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

57:03.550 --> 57:06.303
OK. National power grid.

57:06.386 --> 57:09.932
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

57:10.015 --> 57:12.559
each with a primary hub.

57:12.643 --> 57:14.728
Here it is.

57:15.896 --> 57:18.690
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

57:18.774 --> 57:24.279
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

57:24.363 --> 57:26.823
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

57:26.907 --> 57:31.870
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

57:31.954 --> 57:35.958
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane.

57:36.041 --> 57:38.335
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Shit.

57:38.418 --> 57:43.048
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

57:43.131 --> 57:46.260
I don't care how, you find me a line.

57:46.343 --> 57:49.638
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

57:49.721 --> 57:54.393
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

57:54.476 --> 57:57.813
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

57:57.896 --> 58:00.567
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

58:00.650 --> 58:02.360
OK, let's open it up.

58:05.196 --> 58:07.865
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

58:08.741 --> 58:12.495
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

58:13.955 --> 58:17.166
Don't do that. You're gonna disable it.

58:18.418 --> 58:19.877
Jesus Christ!

58:21.296 --> 58:23.256
That was crazy. Did you see that?

58:23.339 --> 58:27.594
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

58:28.803 --> 58:32.223
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

58:35.393 --> 58:38.479
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

58:38.563 --> 58:40.481
Sorry.

58:43.443 --> 58:47.780
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

58:47.864 --> 58:50.700
I mean, I've read about it.

58:50.783 --> 58:53.828
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

58:53.912 --> 58:58.458
Yes. Please, we just hit a tree
and my dad is having a heart attack.

58:58.541 --> 59:01.002
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

59:01.085 --> 59:03.880
Hold while we contact emergency services.

59:03.963 --> 59:09.052
No, no. He's dying. I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

59:09.135 --> 59:14.183
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

59:14.266 --> 59:16.894
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

59:17.645 --> 59:20.856
My name is... Frank,

59:20.940 --> 59:25.653
and my dad's name is... is...

59:26.987 --> 59:30.241
Dvorak Tsajanski.

59:31.575 --> 59:35.412
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

59:35.496 --> 59:37.706
Emergency services are on their way.

59:37.790 --> 59:40.584
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

59:40.668 --> 59:42.378
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

59:42.461 --> 59:45.714
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

59:45.798 --> 59:48.133
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

59:48.217 --> 59:52.221
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

59:52.304 --> 59:56.558
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

59:56.642 --> 59:58.978
So please start the goddamn car.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.234
Thank you, Dolores.

01:00:05.317 --> 01:00:07.778
Pass the PDA. I gotta call the Warlock.

01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:11.448
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:33.013
- Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBI. We suspect a security breach.

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.890
You can't land here without authorisa...

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:58.163
That was pretty good back there, kid.

01:00:58.246 --> 01:00:59.789
Thanks.

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:03.585
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

01:01:03.668 --> 01:01:06.171
No. I'm just...

01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:10.967
- Well, what? What's the matter with you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

01:01:11.051 --> 01:01:13.595
What's that mean? Like what?

01:01:13.678 --> 01:01:18.433
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

01:01:18.516 --> 01:01:21.227
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.939
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

01:01:24.022 --> 01:01:27.234
Just doing my job, that's all.

01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:33.657
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.827
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

01:01:40.456 --> 01:01:42.708
You get divorced.

01:01:42.792 --> 01:01:45.878
A wife that can't remember your last name.

01:01:45.962 --> 01:01:48.381
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

01:01:49.632 --> 01:01:52.802
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

01:01:52.885 --> 01:01:56.472
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:02:00.977
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.146
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:07.191
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:11.404
And that's what makes you that guy.

01:02:20.288 --> 01:02:22.290
Thing's flying now.

01:02:22.373 --> 01:02:25.293
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

01:02:31.966 --> 01:02:35.678
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

01:03:00.287 --> 01:03:02.831
Stay here.

01:03:31.735 --> 01:03:33.820
All right, come on.

01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:55.300
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

01:04:05.811 --> 01:04:08.022
Guess you were right, kid.

01:04:08.106 --> 01:04:11.359
OK, that's awful.

01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:14.862
We got company.

01:04:23.746 --> 01:04:26.165
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

01:04:26.249 --> 01:04:30.378
- Come on.
- Central control room. OK...

01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:35.133
- Fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.138
You take the right.

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:46.019
Shit.

01:04:48.521 --> 01:04:50.607
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:53.860
I am. I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

01:04:53.943 --> 01:04:57.363
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:20.845
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:05:33.108 --> 01:05:35.819
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

01:05:35.903 --> 01:05:38.781
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

01:05:38.864 --> 01:05:41.283
With the amount of hardware they're running,

01:05:41.367 --> 01:05:46.038
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:48.832
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:52.836
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

01:06:12.231 --> 01:06:13.941
Play time's over, sweetheart.

01:06:14.024 --> 01:06:15.192
Don't.

01:06:15.276 --> 01:06:17.778
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:20.614
Stand up.

01:06:26.745 --> 01:06:29.164
Go on. Now.

01:06:29.248 --> 01:06:32.001
Let's go, kid. You're up.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:33.752
OK...

01:06:35.338 --> 01:06:36.965
As fast as you can.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:41.136
Jesus!

01:06:57.944 --> 01:07:00.030
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

01:07:00.113 --> 01:07:04.534
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

01:07:09.664 --> 01:07:11.666
Still awake?

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:14.002
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'
- OK.

01:07:14.085 --> 01:07:16.630
- How much time do you need?
- Not much.

01:07:30.018 --> 01:07:32.604
- Are you done?
- I...

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:34.606
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

01:07:34.689 --> 01:07:37.692
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

01:07:39.027 --> 01:07:42.489
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their API and booting the host.

01:07:42.572 --> 01:07:45.951
- What?
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

01:07:46.034 --> 01:07:48.411
Not the easiest thing to do when...

01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:02.843
OK...

01:08:03.761 --> 01:08:05.972
Undo everything you just did. Now.

01:08:06.055 --> 01:08:08.266
OK. OK, OK.

01:08:09.016 --> 01:08:13.229
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

01:08:14.146 --> 01:08:15.606
I'm a righty.

01:08:49.015 --> 01:08:51.892
One last door to open.

01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:55.979
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realise what this'll do to the country?

01:08:56.063 --> 01:09:00.151
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

01:09:00.234 --> 01:09:03.779
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

01:09:10.245 --> 01:09:13.122
You do? I'm glad you know.

01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:30.933
How you doin'

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.609
Hang on.

01:10:54.892 --> 01:10:57.979
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

01:11:02.567 --> 01:11:05.612
How you doin'
That's not too tight, is it?

01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:10.575
Damn it.

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:14.579
Smile pretty.

01:11:48.364 --> 01:11:49.490
McClane!

01:11:51.784 --> 01:11:53.577
Shit.

01:11:54.203 --> 01:11:56.789
McClane, get out of there.

01:11:57.957 --> 01:12:00.209
Come on, man. Come on.

01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:06.340
Come on, man.

01:12:26.485 --> 01:12:28.153
Did you see that?

01:12:32.074 --> 01:12:34.076
So you stopped it, right?

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:37.538
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:41.041
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

01:12:43.919 --> 01:12:47.340
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

01:12:49.676 --> 01:12:52.470
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

01:12:54.306 --> 01:12:58.602
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

01:12:58.685 --> 01:13:02.397
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

01:13:03.565 --> 01:13:08.612
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

01:13:08.695 --> 01:13:13.491
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

01:13:14.242 --> 01:13:16.036
It's an e-bomb.

01:13:28.298 --> 01:13:29.799
All right, wait, wait.

01:13:33.595 --> 01:13:36.139
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

01:13:37.098 --> 01:13:41.144
Yeah - little Asian chick, likes to kick people?

01:13:41.227 --> 01:13:45.106
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:50.612
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

01:13:51.488 --> 01:13:54.532
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

01:13:54.616 --> 01:13:58.161
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

01:13:59.997 --> 01:14:04.460
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:14:04.543 --> 01:14:10.675
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

01:14:10.758 --> 01:14:13.427
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

01:14:13.511 --> 01:14:17.306
I will focus all my attention on you.

01:14:18.599 --> 01:14:21.394
You wanna make things personal, fine.

01:14:41.455 --> 01:14:46.919
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

01:14:47.503 --> 01:14:52.133
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

01:14:52.216 --> 01:14:53.384
Do it.

01:14:53.467 --> 01:14:55.344
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

01:14:58.973 --> 01:15:00.933
Please, no.

01:15:01.892 --> 01:15:03.853
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

01:15:05.563 --> 01:15:08.816
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

01:15:08.899 --> 01:15:12.446
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:16.575
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

01:15:16.658 --> 01:15:20.787
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:22.497
You think so?

01:15:22.581 --> 01:15:25.792
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:30.088
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:32.591
We got a pretty serious problem.

01:15:32.674 --> 01:15:34.843
Hold on one minute.
What?

01:15:34.927 --> 01:15:38.972
I think we need to get out of here right now.

01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:42.601
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:43.810
Christ.

01:15:45.562 --> 01:15:49.566
All of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:53.195
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

01:15:53.278 --> 01:15:56.698
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

01:15:56.782 --> 01:15:59.201
McClane? McClane?

01:15:59.284 --> 01:16:01.620
Let's go. Finish this up.

01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:10.587
Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.

01:16:29.774 --> 01:16:31.276
Get in there.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.158
You OK?

01:17:23.786 --> 01:17:27.916
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

01:17:27.999 --> 01:17:30.293
Knock that off, come on.

01:17:30.376 --> 01:17:35.965
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

01:17:36.049 --> 01:17:39.802
Win? When do we start winning?

01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:44.224
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

01:17:44.308 --> 01:17:46.810
We just got the shit kicked out of us.

01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:48.979
You think I'm holding out on you?

01:17:49.063 --> 01:17:53.067
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you.
I would happily tell you.

01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:55.527
Jesus.

01:18:31.772 --> 01:18:34.775
The Warlock. The Warlock.

01:18:34.858 --> 01:18:37.903
Great. There goes the cellphone.

01:18:37.987 --> 01:18:41.615
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

01:18:41.699 --> 01:18:43.492
- We should go see him.
- Who?

01:18:43.576 --> 01:18:46.370
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:50.249
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- This is me helping you.

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:55.714
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:04.097
- How do you feel about flying?
- About what? Like, with a pilot?

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:14.399
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

01:19:14.482 --> 01:19:17.277
Here, put these on.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.946
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:24.034
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

01:19:24.117 --> 01:19:26.578
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:30.123
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

01:19:30.206 --> 01:19:33.168
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

01:19:38.048 --> 01:19:41.009
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

01:19:42.636 --> 01:19:47.140
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

01:19:47.223 --> 01:19:48.767
Really? I heard...

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:53.355
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha. You did? Really?

01:19:53.438 --> 01:19:57.859
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

01:19:57.943 --> 01:20:01.529
- Oh, God.
- Here we go. We're up.

01:20:01.613 --> 01:20:03.490
Oh, God.

01:20:07.786 --> 01:20:10.665
That's good. That's pretty good.

01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:15.044
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

01:20:17.171 --> 01:20:19.465
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:22.760
It's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

01:20:30.685 --> 01:20:35.982
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:39.568
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

01:20:39.652 --> 01:20:42.154
How the hell are they getting past us?

01:20:45.866 --> 01:20:47.994
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:49.787
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:56.669
What? Are we gonna land down there?

01:20:58.462 --> 01:21:00.423
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK.

01:21:03.593 --> 01:21:05.428
Fence. Fence. Fence.

01:21:07.888 --> 01:21:09.557
- Fence. Fence.
- I see it.

01:21:10.224 --> 01:21:11.642
Watch...

01:21:23.655 --> 01:21:25.574
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:29.119
Yeah, yeah. "Taking off's the hardest part."

01:21:29.202 --> 01:21:30.162
Let's go.

01:21:33.332 --> 01:21:38.253
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

01:21:38.337 --> 01:21:41.632
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

01:21:50.432 --> 01:21:52.351
Shit.

01:21:52.434 --> 01:21:54.728
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:56.480
Is Freddy home?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.485
I'm Matt Farrell and this is...

01:22:01.568 --> 01:22:03.362
Billy.

01:22:03.445 --> 01:22:08.367
We're friends from Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

01:22:09.868 --> 01:22:11.828
Freddy!

01:22:11.912 --> 01:22:14.581
- Freddy?
- You got company.

01:22:21.046 --> 01:22:24.216
Frederick. Didn't you hear me?

01:22:24.299 --> 01:22:26.343
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

01:22:26.426 --> 01:22:29.638
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the?

01:22:30.264 --> 01:22:34.309
Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

01:22:34.393 --> 01:22:39.357
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.694
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:47.448
Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

01:22:47.532 --> 01:22:53.913
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

01:22:53.997 --> 01:22:56.916
And don't touch that, all right?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.837
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.549
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

01:23:04.632 --> 01:23:08.136
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

01:23:08.219 --> 01:23:10.430
whether they be zombies or not.

01:23:10.513 --> 01:23:14.767
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

01:23:14.851 --> 01:23:17.020
Nice poster.

01:23:17.687 --> 01:23:23.484
- What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

01:23:24.193 --> 01:23:26.904
- <i>Star Wars</i> guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

01:23:26.988 --> 01:23:29.407
Dump truck. I'm not his dad.

01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:33.536
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.748
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:39.208
Command centre. It's a basement.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:41.711
- It's a command centre.
- I can explain.

01:23:41.794 --> 01:23:45.673
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

01:23:45.757 --> 01:23:47.842
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

01:23:47.926 --> 01:23:50.262
Get out. I want you outta here, right now.

01:23:50.346 --> 01:23:53.599
Calm down. Just calm down, big boy.

01:23:53.682 --> 01:23:56.101
You calm down. It's my house.

01:23:56.185 --> 01:24:00.898
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:19.708
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:21.919
First day on the job, tells his bosses

01:24:22.002 --> 01:24:25.589
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

01:24:25.673 --> 01:24:30.886
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up cos he is committed.

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.889
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

01:24:33.973 --> 01:24:38.894
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defence network.

01:24:38.978 --> 01:24:42.314
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

01:24:42.398 --> 01:24:46.568
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

01:24:46.652 --> 01:24:49.405
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

01:24:49.488 --> 01:24:52.658
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

01:24:52.741 --> 01:24:54.952
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

01:24:55.035 --> 01:24:58.455
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

01:24:58.539 --> 01:25:04.170
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

01:25:04.254 --> 01:25:07.591
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

01:25:07.674 --> 01:25:11.469
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

01:25:11.553 --> 01:25:14.723
The only security system in the country
that I can find

01:25:14.806 --> 01:25:19.269
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

01:25:19.352 --> 01:25:24.733
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

01:25:24.816 --> 01:25:27.944
- Whoa. What the hell? God.
- I know, right?

01:25:28.028 --> 01:25:31.740
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

01:25:31.823 --> 01:25:35.535
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- Why are there chilling towers?

01:25:35.619 --> 01:25:36.995
Hello.

01:25:37.078 --> 01:25:39.581
What's a chilling tower?

01:25:39.664 --> 01:25:42.083
See what I've been dealing with?

01:25:42.167 --> 01:25:45.754
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

01:25:45.837 --> 01:25:47.255
But why there?

01:25:47.339 --> 01:25:52.177
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

01:25:57.682 --> 01:26:02.854
I got a red flag over here.
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

01:26:03.688 --> 01:26:06.900
Honing in on the host server right now.

01:26:07.609 --> 01:26:09.778
"Frederick Kaludis."

01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:12.030
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

01:26:17.035 --> 01:26:18.412
McClane.

01:26:18.496 --> 01:26:22.917
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.585
You'll love this.

01:26:28.839 --> 01:26:31.467
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

01:26:43.604 --> 01:26:45.481
- Freddy?
- What?

01:26:45.564 --> 01:26:49.151
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

01:26:53.531 --> 01:26:55.324
McClane?

01:26:55.408 --> 01:26:57.326
I thought I killed you already.

01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:59.412
I get that sometimes.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.085
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

01:27:06.168 --> 01:27:11.215
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

01:27:12.508 --> 01:27:18.681
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:22.435
but I'm still alive, ain't I?

01:27:23.311 --> 01:27:28.858
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right?

01:27:31.528 --> 01:27:33.530
Gabriel?

01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:38.493
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

01:27:38.577 --> 01:27:43.373
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

01:27:43.457 --> 01:27:45.834
And I bet you're still on hold with,

01:27:45.918 --> 01:27:51.465
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?"

01:27:51.548 --> 01:27:57.554
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

01:27:57.638 --> 01:28:00.933
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:04.686
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:06.605
Yeah?

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.359
Is this one of them?

01:28:14.821 --> 01:28:17.699
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

01:28:17.783 --> 01:28:19.618
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:23.413
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

01:28:23.497 --> 01:28:26.333
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

01:28:26.416 --> 01:28:30.587
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

01:28:30.671 --> 01:28:32.547
Everything is gonna be all right.

01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:37.302
- Lucy, hang up the phone.
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

01:28:40.055 --> 01:28:43.058
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

01:28:43.141 --> 01:28:45.687
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:50.108
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:53.778
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:55.571
Yeah.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:58.616
My dad.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.412
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

01:29:03.079 --> 01:29:09.294
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you, very soon.

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:12.880
Thank you.

01:29:13.923 --> 01:29:18.761
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.806
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:23.975
Come on, John.

01:29:25.184 --> 01:29:27.729
Make ajoke.

01:29:27.812 --> 01:29:30.857
Say somethin' funny.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:39.240
Where? Where you goin'

01:29:39.657 --> 01:29:44.245
McClane. Hold on.
Where you goin' What are you gonna do?

01:29:44.329 --> 01:29:48.541
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

01:29:48.625 --> 01:29:52.712
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

01:29:52.795 --> 01:29:56.382
- I think I...
- I'm doing you a favour.

01:29:56.466 --> 01:29:58.885
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

01:29:58.968 --> 01:30:00.971
I'll take it from here.

01:30:01.055 --> 01:30:03.474
Thanks for your help.

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:14.234
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

01:30:16.028 --> 01:30:18.113
Buckle up.

01:30:44.014 --> 01:30:46.308
FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.

01:30:46.392 --> 01:30:48.394
Mind if I see your ID?

01:30:48.477 --> 01:30:50.562
Not at all.

01:30:59.613 --> 01:31:01.991
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:06.120
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:12.918
Kid, can you get Bowman?

01:31:13.003 --> 01:31:15.088
Yeah.

01:31:24.723 --> 01:31:26.725
It's completely dead.

01:31:26.808 --> 01:31:30.437
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

01:31:35.692 --> 01:31:38.194
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

01:31:40.739 --> 01:31:42.991
About all of it.

01:31:43.074 --> 01:31:45.911
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

01:31:45.994 --> 01:31:47.704
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

01:31:52.792 --> 01:31:55.795
- Let go of me, you bastard.
- This bitch is a handful.

01:32:01.801 --> 01:32:04.179
Are you gonna be all right?

01:32:06.348 --> 01:32:08.808
Behave or I will hurt you.

01:32:08.892 --> 01:32:13.980
Yeah? Let's step outside, just you and me.
We'll see who hurts who.

01:32:15.857 --> 01:32:18.193
You really are his daughter.

01:32:18.276 --> 01:32:19.945
Tie her wrists.

01:32:27.119 --> 01:32:29.455
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

01:32:29.538 --> 01:32:32.083
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

01:32:33.376 --> 01:32:34.752
OK.

01:32:35.711 --> 01:32:38.464
I'll be back in a second.

01:32:43.302 --> 01:32:45.221
No, no, no, please.

01:33:30.349 --> 01:33:33.269
We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

01:33:37.523 --> 01:33:39.942
Go take a look.

01:33:40.484 --> 01:33:42.738
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

01:33:54.374 --> 01:33:58.086
McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

01:33:58.170 --> 01:34:00.213
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

01:34:00.297 --> 01:34:04.176
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

01:34:06.386 --> 01:34:08.388
Come on.

01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:15.687
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:22.235
I think mine's locked.

01:34:25.906 --> 01:34:29.785
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

01:34:40.671 --> 01:34:46.051
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:49.012
If I can just hack in,

01:34:50.722 --> 01:34:53.558
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

01:35:02.026 --> 01:35:03.820
Someone set off the alarms.

01:35:03.903 --> 01:35:08.032
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

01:35:12.203 --> 01:35:14.247
What have you got?

01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:18.793
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

01:35:20.086 --> 01:35:22.005
It's gotta be him.

01:35:22.088 --> 01:35:24.299
And what's Woodlawn?

01:35:28.428 --> 01:35:32.515
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

01:35:32.599 --> 01:35:37.353
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

01:35:37.437 --> 01:35:42.442
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

01:35:42.525 --> 01:35:47.614
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

01:35:47.697 --> 01:35:51.534
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

01:35:51.618 --> 01:35:54.037
All in one location?

01:35:55.163 --> 01:35:56.831
What could Gabriel do with it?

01:35:56.915 --> 01:36:00.877
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.841
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

01:36:06.925 --> 01:36:08.510
We couldn't trace it.

01:36:08.594 --> 01:36:14.516
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.980
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

01:36:20.064 --> 01:36:22.149
My pay grade?

01:36:24.485 --> 01:36:30.074
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

01:36:32.117 --> 01:36:34.245
He designed it.

01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:37.581
It was his program.

01:36:37.665 --> 01:36:42.962
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

01:36:43.045 --> 01:36:44.630
That's brilliant.

01:36:44.713 --> 01:36:48.592
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

01:36:53.973 --> 01:36:57.726
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

01:36:58.269 --> 01:37:00.229
Don't move.

01:37:00.312 --> 01:37:02.856
You, get away from the bag. Now.

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.566
OK, OK.

01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:06.902
We've been waiting for you.

01:37:07.653 --> 01:37:11.031
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

01:37:38.351 --> 01:37:40.186
McClane!

01:37:41.521 --> 01:37:43.023
McClane!

01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.027
Kid?

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:48.570
Matt?

01:37:48.653 --> 01:37:49.779
Kid.

01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:05.378
Emerson.

01:38:06.296 --> 01:38:08.715
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

01:38:08.798 --> 01:38:10.175
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

01:38:10.258 --> 01:38:12.969
Find out what's going on.

01:38:21.811 --> 01:38:22.854
Sir?

01:38:22.938 --> 01:38:25.649
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

01:38:25.732 --> 01:38:28.526
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:30.445
Then get us some helicopters.

01:38:30.528 --> 01:38:33.490
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:37.578
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:41.165
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:44.210
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:46.379
Let's go.

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:59.600
Where's my daughter?

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:02.103
Russo, check in.

01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:10.194
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:13.656
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:16.867
It's McClane. He's on the third floor.

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:23.749
Get all that? That's right.

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:27.461
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.472
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:44.228
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

01:40:30.567 --> 01:40:32.444
My algorithm.

01:40:38.492 --> 01:40:41.036
OK, please, God.

01:40:41.495 --> 01:40:43.538
Please, God...

01:41:19.659 --> 01:41:23.204
Jesus, they're going after the money.

01:41:45.685 --> 01:41:48.605
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

01:41:48.688 --> 01:41:50.898
Yep, that's my plan.

01:41:50.982 --> 01:41:54.360
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

01:41:54.444 --> 01:41:57.739
- Cos you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

01:41:58.448 --> 01:42:01.743
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

01:42:08.708 --> 01:42:11.461
Stop there. Hands up.

01:42:11.544 --> 01:42:14.047
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

01:42:16.925 --> 01:42:19.178
Move away. Move.

01:42:26.393 --> 01:42:30.481
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

01:42:30.564 --> 01:42:34.151
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

01:42:34.234 --> 01:42:37.029
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

01:42:37.112 --> 01:42:40.616
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

01:42:40.699 --> 01:42:44.286
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:48.207
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:52.962
- I am doing the country a favour.
- By tearing it apart.

01:42:53.045 --> 01:42:58.175
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

01:42:58.259 --> 01:43:00.928
Nobody wants to see that happen.

01:43:01.011 --> 01:43:07.268
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:10.646
Bullshit. It's always been about the money.

01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:14.942
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

01:43:15.025 --> 01:43:18.696
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a cheque for you.

01:43:21.782 --> 01:43:26.578
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

01:43:26.662 --> 01:43:27.705
Dad?

01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:32.752
Hi, baby.

01:43:32.836 --> 01:43:35.213
Now there are only five of them.

01:43:37.674 --> 01:43:40.260
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'

01:43:50.478 --> 01:43:54.107
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:57.569
We have a problem.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.324
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

01:44:04.951 --> 01:44:07.037
This is a mess.

01:44:08.955 --> 01:44:13.168
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

01:44:13.251 --> 01:44:17.505
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:20.759
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

01:44:20.842 --> 01:44:24.054
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

01:44:24.137 --> 01:44:26.640
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

01:44:27.265 --> 01:44:28.808
Matt Farrell.

01:44:29.643 --> 01:44:31.978
Lucy McClane.

01:44:32.062 --> 01:44:35.523
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

01:44:35.607 --> 01:44:37.400
Not today.

01:44:37.484 --> 01:44:41.446
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

01:44:41.529 --> 01:44:43.782
That's encouraging.

01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:47.745
Take them with us.

01:44:47.828 --> 01:44:49.956
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:44:52.541 --> 01:44:55.294
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

01:44:55.378 --> 01:44:57.463
Keep an eye on it.

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.385
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:21.612
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

01:45:28.202 --> 01:45:30.913
Christ! Goddamn hamster.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.999
There you go.

01:45:33.082 --> 01:45:35.543
Stay still, spider-boy.

01:45:39.547 --> 01:45:41.340
That's right.

01:46:10.412 --> 01:46:12.247
Goddammit!

01:46:21.423 --> 01:46:22.591
Oh, no.

01:46:25.052 --> 01:46:29.514
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

01:46:29.598 --> 01:46:34.019
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.

01:46:34.102 --> 01:46:39.191
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

01:47:15.728 --> 01:47:16.896
Sir.

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.856
ETA 15 minutes.

01:47:43.548 --> 01:47:46.050
There we go.

01:48:13.202 --> 01:48:14.954
Fix it.

01:48:15.038 --> 01:48:18.374
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

01:48:25.089 --> 01:48:26.758
Oh, shit!

01:48:30.387 --> 01:48:32.806
I'm not gonna do it.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.314
- No, no, no. Shit.
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

01:48:40.397 --> 01:48:42.566
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:44.693
Robinson is coming too fast.

01:48:49.073 --> 01:48:51.033
It's not Robinson.

01:48:51.116 --> 01:48:53.118
That would be my dad.

01:49:04.463 --> 01:49:06.590
Freddy?

01:49:07.508 --> 01:49:09.301
Freddy?

01:49:10.177 --> 01:49:11.971
It's John McClane.

01:49:12.054 --> 01:49:15.599
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

01:49:15.683 --> 01:49:18.435
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

01:49:21.105 --> 01:49:23.440
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

01:49:23.524 --> 01:49:25.609
Hackerjerk-off.

01:49:29.655 --> 01:49:31.699
Warlock...

01:49:31.782 --> 01:49:37.037
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBI.

01:49:37.121 --> 01:49:39.123
To Deputy Director Bowman.

01:49:39.206 --> 01:49:41.793
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

01:49:41.876 --> 01:49:44.421
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

01:49:44.504 --> 01:49:48.300
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

01:49:48.633 --> 01:49:51.052
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter.

01:49:56.391 --> 01:49:58.768
I can do that. Hold on.

01:49:59.978 --> 01:50:02.063
Thank you.

01:50:08.236 --> 01:50:11.615
This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

01:50:12.073 --> 01:50:15.076
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

01:50:16.411 --> 01:50:17.412
Go.

01:50:17.495 --> 01:50:19.956
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.919
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

01:50:24.002 --> 01:50:27.964
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

01:50:28.048 --> 01:50:31.259
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

01:50:31.885 --> 01:50:36.556
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.850
Track that down, it should take you to him.

01:50:38.934 --> 01:50:42.479
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

01:50:42.562 --> 01:50:44.689
Golf... Tango...

01:50:46.232 --> 01:50:50.362
five... niner... two... November.

01:50:50.445 --> 01:50:53.073
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

01:50:53.156 --> 01:50:54.699
He's with them.

01:50:55.576 --> 01:50:57.078
Listen to me.

01:50:57.161 --> 01:51:01.624
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

01:51:01.707 --> 01:51:06.254
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

01:51:06.337 --> 01:51:08.506
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:12.009
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

01:51:14.345 --> 01:51:16.722
Yeah, you have it.

01:51:16.806 --> 01:51:18.599
McClane out.

01:51:25.898 --> 01:51:27.066
There's the F-35.

01:51:29.694 --> 01:51:31.988
Did you get the "go" codes?

01:51:32.071 --> 01:51:34.490
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

01:51:34.573 --> 01:51:37.243
Can you connect me to the pilot?

01:51:53.843 --> 01:51:56.345
Isolating his radio.

01:52:01.225 --> 01:52:03.936
Sending him the "go" codes.

01:52:10.110 --> 01:52:11.361
AV-81.

01:52:11.445 --> 01:52:16.783
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

01:52:16.867 --> 01:52:20.537
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

01:52:21.997 --> 01:52:24.916
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.753
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

01:52:27.836 --> 01:52:30.297
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

01:52:38.513 --> 01:52:39.723
What?

01:52:47.606 --> 01:52:50.776
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

01:52:53.904 --> 01:52:55.781
You're shooting at the wrong guy.

01:53:03.789 --> 01:53:06.124
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

01:53:19.888 --> 01:53:21.723
Jackass!

01:54:08.688 --> 01:54:11.024
Is that it?

01:54:13.985 --> 01:54:16.821
Is that your best shot?

01:54:58.697 --> 01:55:00.240
Come on!

01:55:08.791 --> 01:55:10.084
Damn.

01:55:26.475 --> 01:55:28.269
Come on.

01:57:01.738 --> 01:57:03.698
Let's go. Come on.

01:57:03.782 --> 01:57:05.868
That way. It's that way. Go.

01:57:14.877 --> 01:57:17.546
We are leaving in three minutes.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.135
You have one.

01:57:23.219 --> 01:57:26.722
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

01:57:30.559 --> 01:57:33.145
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Matthew?

01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:34.480
Matthew.

01:57:34.563 --> 01:57:37.400
I really need you to pay attention.

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:41.237
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.698
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

01:57:43.781 --> 01:57:45.658
Nine.

01:57:45.741 --> 01:57:47.326
I can't.

01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:49.412
Eight.

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:51.289
I can't.

01:57:52.081 --> 01:57:53.499
Oh, God.

01:57:56.419 --> 01:57:57.712
OK.

01:57:59.547 --> 01:58:01.007
OK, OK, OK.

01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:02.675
Six.

01:58:02.758 --> 01:58:06.679
OK, stop. Stop, stop.
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

01:58:06.762 --> 01:58:09.390
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:58:22.904 --> 01:58:25.282
Feds are headed this way.

01:58:25.365 --> 01:58:27.993
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

01:58:37.127 --> 01:58:39.087
- Dad.
- Careful.

01:58:39.171 --> 01:58:42.674
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:58:44.676 --> 01:58:46.762
Daddy!

01:58:51.934 --> 01:58:53.518
No.

01:58:53.602 --> 01:58:55.938
Hold this.

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.795
No.

01:59:21.088 --> 01:59:23.257
Jesus Christ.

01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:25.550
You got her?

01:59:25.926 --> 01:59:27.844
You're sure?

01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:31.556
Nice effort, though.

01:59:32.182 --> 01:59:35.270
- Matthew.
- Oh, shit. All right, OK.

01:59:35.353 --> 01:59:37.188
OK. I'm doin' it. I know.

01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:47.073
McClane.

01:59:47.156 --> 01:59:50.076
Would you do me a favour?

01:59:51.411 --> 01:59:56.374
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

01:59:56.457 --> 01:59:59.669
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

01:59:59.752 --> 02:00:02.630
and I would love for you to see that.

02:00:04.215 --> 02:00:06.676
Goddammit. Matthew?

02:00:06.759 --> 02:00:09.262
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

02:00:09.345 --> 02:00:13.433
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

02:00:13.516 --> 02:00:15.643
McClane.

02:00:16.686 --> 02:00:19.147
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

02:00:19.897 --> 02:00:25.153
On your tombstone it should read, " Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

02:00:25.945 --> 02:00:29.907
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf..."

02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:46.342
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

02:00:46.425 --> 02:00:49.595
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

02:00:51.639 --> 02:00:53.182
I knew you'd come for me.

02:00:53.265 --> 02:00:57.978
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:07.529
Move, move.

02:01:12.576 --> 02:01:14.203
Freeze!

02:01:14.286 --> 02:01:17.164
Hold, hold. He's OK.

02:01:19.166 --> 02:01:21.835
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around.

02:01:21.919 --> 02:01:24.088
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:28.842
Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

02:01:28.926 --> 02:01:33.055
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

02:01:33.138 --> 02:01:37.977
- You shot yourself.
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:41.188
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

02:01:52.533 --> 02:01:55.327
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

02:01:57.288 --> 02:01:59.248
Is he OK?

02:02:00.292 --> 02:02:03.128
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

02:02:03.211 --> 02:02:05.547
Put 'em down further?

02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:09.968
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

02:02:12.679 --> 02:02:14.556
All right.

02:02:16.558 --> 02:02:18.476
I'll be right back.

02:02:20.186 --> 02:02:22.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:02:22.439 --> 02:02:25.066
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:28.570
He gave me some...
What's it called? Morphine.

02:02:28.653 --> 02:02:34.326
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

02:02:34.409 --> 02:02:38.413
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really?

02:02:39.914 --> 02:02:41.916
Not that one.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.793
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

02:02:43.877 --> 02:02:47.631
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

02:02:47.714 --> 02:02:52.260
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

02:02:52.344 --> 02:02:53.762
Yeah.

02:02:53.845 --> 02:02:58.934
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

02:03:00.685 --> 02:03:02.687
That would suck.

02:03:04.272 --> 02:03:06.107
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

02:03:06.191 --> 02:03:09.903
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

02:03:16.535 --> 02:03:20.957
Thanks for saving my daughter's life.

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.417
What was I gonna do?

02:03:24.877 --> 02:03:27.046
That's what makes you that guy.

02:03:30.049 --> 02:03:32.343
Yeah.

02:03:37.807 --> 02:03:40.685
So, did he say anything about me?

02:03:42.603 --> 02:03:44.647
Jesus, Lucy.

02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:46.941
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

02:03:48.442 --> 02:03:50.861
I'm in enough pain already.

02:03:50.945 --> 02:03:52.863
Hospital.

02:03:53.305 --> 02:03:59.370
