I was supposed to help negotiate

Well, let's see how it all went.

any cash on me right now.

- I don't have it, you little shit!

just pay my son what you owe him?

10:58.081 --> 11:00.166
You remind me of my son.

11:01.167 --> 11:04.004
He came out albino, so we shunned him.

11:04.087 --> 11:06.548
Sold him off to the circus.

11:06.631 --> 11:08.842
[sobbing] We didn't know no better!

11:10.010 --> 11:12.929
That's what you did back then! Oh, God!

11:13.012 --> 11:15.223
Being a father is about
making tough decisions.

11:15.306 --> 11:19.519
To this day, I never spent that 75 bucks

11:19.602 --> 11:23.022
that ringmaster gave me,
in case he came back.

11:23.982 --> 11:27.902
Tell me, Frank Murphy, is your name Larry?

11:27.986 --> 11:29.154
Huh?

11:29.237 --> 11:33.408
Is your name Larry, Frank Murphy?
Tell me your name is Larry!

11:33.491 --> 11:34.909
Smokey, I wish it was.

11:38.288 --> 11:40.832
All right, Frank. You go on home now.

11:41.708 --> 11:46.963
And hug them normal-skinned kids tight!

11:49.174 --> 11:52.927
<i>[radio DJ] That was "Nodding Off"

11:53.011 --> 11:56.034

Oh, shit.

12:31.674 --> 12:33.551
Good morning to you too.

12:34.427 --> 12:36.137
- Today's your big pitch, huh?
- Yep.

12:36.221 --> 12:39.557
I rehearsed it all night in the mirror
and I think I've got it down.

12:39.641 --> 12:43.478
I'm gonna bide my time,
wait for the perfect moment, and then...

12:45.438 --> 12:46.815
Oh...

12:47.899 --> 12:49.400
Thanks for listening.

12:50.652 --> 12:52.403

Let's get to that store before
all the Jacques Dupuis sticks are gone!

13:02.247 --> 13:05.083
I can't wait to use that baby in tryouts.

13:05.166 --> 13:08.378
And I'll cheer you on
safely behind the glass.

13:08.461 --> 13:13.299
Oh, look! It's Billy bitch-tits
and his Pumpkin-headed pussy.

13:13.383 --> 13:15.051
My name's Phillip.

13:15.134 --> 13:17.554
Leave us alone, you monkey-eared asshole!

13:17.637 --> 13:20.265

Ow! Ow! [grunts]

13:24.394 --> 13:26.062
Quit it! Stop!

13:26.145 --> 13:27.939
- Phillip!
- The king will slap his subject.

13:28.022 --> 13:29.566
Ow! Ow!

13:29.649 --> 13:32.235
Well, what have we here?

13:32.777 --> 13:35.238
Hey, that's mine! I earned it!

13:35.321 --> 13:37.532
And his lordship will take it from you!

13:37.615 --> 13:39.701
Leave him alone or I will fucking eat you!

13:45.748 --> 13:48.501
- You okay, Red?
- Yeah.

13:48.585 --> 13:50.545
Why the fuck didn't you help him?

13:50.628 --> 13:53.381
Mother says, "Violence begets violence."

13:53.464 --> 13:55.425
Your mother's an asshole.

13:55.508 --> 13:58.303
Don't ever let me catch you
doing that shit again.

13:58.386 --> 13:59.637
Thanks, Randy.

13:59.721 --> 14:01.306
Anything for you, kid.

14:01.389 --> 14:02.974
Us newsies gotta stick together.

14:03.057 --> 14:06.853
There's always a Jehovah's Witness
around the corner, looking to fuck you up.

14:06.936 --> 14:10.148
Could I borrow ten dollars from you
until next collection day?

14:10.231 --> 14:13.818
What, so that fucking lesbian
can take it from you again?

14:13.902 --> 14:17.739
But I need to get this hockey stick.
Tryouts are tomorrow.

14:17.822 --> 14:19.532
Not my problem, Red.

14:19.616 --> 14:20.950
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.162
So, you better start eating!

14:28.124 --> 14:30.376
What the fuck does that mean?

14:32.420 --> 14:35.340
Usually, when you put butter on a muffin,

14:35.423 --> 14:37.717
it runs off the sides
and gets on the table.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.637
But with
the "Triple Tiered Muffin Holder,"

14:40.720 --> 14:45.099
the butter simply drips down onto
the next level of muffins and beyond.

14:45.183 --> 14:48.978
It's like a champagne tree,
except for butter!

14:49.062 --> 14:51.397
Why don't you cut the muffin in half
like everyone else?

14:51.481 --> 14:54.192
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

14:54.275 --> 14:57.111
Well, we certainly
didn't save the best for last.

14:57.195 --> 15:01.241
I'm gonna go see which of my guns
fits best in my mouth.

15:01.324 --> 15:02.367
Excuse me, Tracy.

15:02.450 --> 15:06.913
I know I'm just the secretary, but...
I have an idea I'd like to pitch.

15:06.996 --> 15:08.957
I'd like to pitch her idea.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.168
I'm curious, Gene, do you use that mouth
when you kiss another man's penis?

15:12.252 --> 15:13.753
Yeah!

15:13.836 --> 15:15.421
You sure got me!

15:15.505 --> 15:18.383
That's what your wife says
when the postman puts it in her hiney.

15:18.466 --> 15:20.009
[all laugh]

15:20.093 --> 15:23.763
I'm gonna call you Heart Disease
because you're killing me!

15:23.846 --> 15:25.681
[Tracy] Yeah!
[laughter]

15:27.934 --> 15:30.103
Go ahead, Sue. Wow us.

15:30.186 --> 15:34.399
Every day, housewives deal
with the problem of soggy lettuce.

15:34.482 --> 15:39.779
It can make any salad a gushy,
sopping, dripping, wet mess.

15:42.949 --> 15:46.744
What, am I that predictable?
She's got me hooked.

15:46.828 --> 15:50.790
So... I came up with
The Salad Tosser.

15:53.084 --> 15:55.837
[Frank snoring]

15:59.257 --> 16:00.591
Dad?

16:02.176 --> 16:03.886
Dad.

16:05.346 --> 16:07.682
Can you make me dinner?
It's 5:00.

16:07.765 --> 16:09.142
Shit!

16:13.771 --> 16:16.357
Daddy, can we go out
and get ice cream for supper?

16:16.441 --> 16:17.775
No. Daddy's got to go to work soon.

16:17.859 --> 16:20.028
You want ice cream,
go to your friend's house and look sad.

16:21.362 --> 16:24.073
That's the face.
You might get two scoops with that mug.

16:24.157 --> 16:27.535
Prisoner 3471,
reporting for solitary confinement.

16:27.618 --> 16:30.705
- Guilty of the crime of dreaming!
- Don't spoil your dinner.

16:30.788 --> 16:33.583
You're not the boss of my stomach!
My mouth is!

16:34.584 --> 16:35.710
Dick!

16:36.419 --> 16:37.754
Everything okay, Daddy?

16:37.837 --> 16:40.423
Princess, when you grow up,
you can be anything you want.

16:41.090 --> 16:43.051
Just not Kevin.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.427
Or a golfer.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.434
How much of your money did Jimmy take?

16:51.517 --> 16:53.686
I only have eleven dollars left.

16:53.770 --> 16:55.563
Now I have to buy a cheaper stick.

16:56.981 --> 16:59.067
What the hell?! The price went up!

16:59.150 --> 17:01.486
And I can't even afford
the shitty one now.

17:01.569 --> 17:03.654
[Phillip] Maybe it's a clerical error.

17:03.738 --> 17:04.739
No mistake.

17:04.821 --> 17:06.406
That's inflation for you.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.326
I really need that stick, sir.

17:08.409 --> 17:09.868
Tryouts are tomorrow.

17:09.952 --> 17:13.623
I had the money.
I worked hard for it, but I got mugged.

17:13.705 --> 17:16.917
And I lost a leg between a station wagon
and a Dumpster,

17:17.001 --> 17:19.878
and they gave me an artificial leg made
for a woman.

17:19.962 --> 17:22.382
But you don't hear me complaining
about it.

17:22.464 --> 17:25.843
Well, you seem to be voicing displeasure.

17:25.926 --> 17:27.220
Please, sir!

17:28.179 --> 17:29.597
Are you crying?

17:29.680 --> 17:32.683
Well, maybe you should go out
for field hockey, you little pussy!

17:34.310 --> 17:37.105
Fuck this! I earned it.

17:37.188 --> 17:40.525
Phillip, ask that guy to show you
something in the back of the store.

17:40.608 --> 17:42.485
I'm taking that stick.

17:42.568 --> 17:44.320
But that's against the law.

17:44.404 --> 17:45.613
Do it.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.198
Okay.

17:50.326 --> 17:55.331
Excuse me. Could you show me
where a man could find a shuttlecock?

17:56.082 --> 17:57.875
Huh. That figures.

18:10.138 --> 18:12.014
[heartbeat pounding]

18:18.938 --> 18:21.482
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ah!

18:21.566 --> 18:24.110
He saw through my charade!

18:24.193 --> 18:26.779
You're in a lot of trouble, bucko.

18:26.863 --> 18:29.282
Please don't call my parents.

18:29.365 --> 18:32.618
That's exactly what I'm gonna do,
you little degenerate.

18:32.702 --> 18:33.703
What's your name?

18:36.080 --> 18:38.207
Out with it! What's your name?

18:38.291 --> 18:40.877
Jimmy.
Jimmy Fitzsimmons.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.795
Well, Jimmy Fitzsimmons,

18:42.879 --> 18:46.424
that's the first honest thing
you've done all day, you little mick.

18:46.507 --> 18:49.469
What's your phone number, Jimmy...
[grunts]

18:50.761 --> 18:53.473
Holy shit, Phillip!
Why did you do that?

18:53.556 --> 18:57.143
- I don't want Randy to eat me!
- Let's get out of here!

19:01.397 --> 19:03.357
[panting]

19:04.609 --> 19:05.776
Oh, my God.

19:05.860 --> 19:09.363
Holy shit.
I told him I was Jimmy.

19:09.447 --> 19:12.450
When he finds out, I'm so dead.

19:12.533 --> 19:15.411
- I got your name, Fitzsimmons!
- Ah!

19:15.495 --> 19:17.246
[screaming]

19:18.706 --> 19:22.210
So, thanks to centrifugal force,

19:22.293 --> 19:24.837
your wife will never have
soggy lettuce again.

19:24.921 --> 19:28.257
You can "leaf" the drying
to The Salad Tosser.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.425
Thank you.

19:29.509 --> 19:32.345
Huh.
Interesting, Sue.

19:32.428 --> 19:34.305
Drying lettuce.

19:34.388 --> 19:35.932
Could be a whole new market.
Does it work?

19:36.015 --> 19:39.852
Yes! And I built a prototype.
I-I have it here.

19:39.936 --> 19:43.105
May I present the handy-dandy,

19:43.189 --> 19:46.817
easy to use, housewife's best friend...

19:48.069 --> 19:49.654
The Salad Tosser!

19:51.405 --> 19:53.449
Uh... [chuckles]

19:53.533 --> 19:55.660
It's a tad big, don't you think?

19:56.369 --> 20:00.206
Well, obviously, the finished
product would be much smaller.

20:00.289 --> 20:04.377
It looks like a washing machine
on a Lazy Susan.

20:04.460 --> 20:07.171
Well, yes, that's what the prototype is,
but it...

20:07.255 --> 20:10.466
- It's not even made of plastic.
- Again, it's a prototype.

20:10.550 --> 20:13.094
Look, let me demonstrate.

20:13.177 --> 20:16.931
[laughs] I don't want to have to ride
a bike every time I make a salad.

20:17.014 --> 20:18.599
[yelling] It's a prototype!

20:18.683 --> 20:20.601
See, like a washing machine...

20:20.685 --> 20:22.144
- Ah, my tie!
- What the fuck?

20:22.228 --> 20:23.187
Jesus!

20:23.271 --> 20:27.316
- Lazy Susan? More like Crazy Susan!
- Crazy Susan!

20:27.400 --> 20:29.443
- [laughing]
- What a piece of shit!

20:29.527 --> 20:31.946
I don't want to laugh in your face.
Turn around!

20:32.029 --> 20:35.366
[laughter]

20:42.081 --> 20:44.041
- Where the hell have you been?
- Nowhere!

20:44.125 --> 20:45.710
What? Dinner's ready.

20:45.793 --> 20:49.088
- Oh, okay.
- Hey. What do you got there?

20:51.173 --> 20:54.343
All right, you bought that stick
you been saving for. Good for you.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.887
I'll take you to those tryouts tomorrow.

20:56.971 --> 21:00.057
That thing you feel inside
is called pride.

21:00.141 --> 21:02.518
Every time you pick up that stick,

21:02.602 --> 21:04.937
you'll have that same sense
of accomplishment that only comes

21:05.021 --> 21:07.898
from knowing that you earned it.

21:07.982 --> 21:11.485
I'll be right back. I got to go feed
my prisoner in the dungeon.

21:11.569 --> 21:12.653
[chuckles]

21:17.074 --> 21:19.035
Hey, Mozart. It's the warden.

21:20.077 --> 21:22.705
Even though you hate me,
I still want you to eat.

21:22.788 --> 21:24.040
Open the door.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.170
Come on. I got you extra meatballs
for good behavior.

21:29.253 --> 21:32.256
Where are you? Kevin? For Christ's sakes!

21:32.340 --> 21:34.800
Out of the Gulag, into the spotlight!

21:34.884 --> 21:36.886
[groaning]

21:38.721 --> 21:41.599
Get the fuck back here! I forbid you!

21:41.682 --> 21:43.434
My dreams are not forbidable!

21:43.517 --> 21:44.685
You lying little shit!

21:44.769 --> 21:46.395
I learned it from the best!

21:46.479 --> 21:47.521
You come back here!

21:47.605 --> 21:50.733
I'll put you and your smart mouth
through that fucking wall!

21:51.609 --> 21:53.569
Do you know what your son did?

21:53.653 --> 21:55.404
[sighs] Jesus, Frank.

21:55.488 --> 21:58.032
He openly defied my authority
and went to that show.

21:58.115 --> 22:01.118
That's exactly what I said would happen
if you pushed him too much.

22:01.202 --> 22:03.871
Well, we're gonna go right down
to that seedy concert hall

22:03.954 --> 22:06.207
and yank his ass right off that stage!

22:06.290 --> 22:08.167
Frank, I've had a horrible day.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.087
They shot my proposal down,
thank you for asking,

22:11.170 --> 22:15.007
and now I have to come home to my husband
throwing meatballs at my oldest son

22:15.091 --> 22:18.052
in front of the entire
fucking neighborhood!

22:18.135 --> 22:22.139
Frank Murphy, you go down there
and you get your son.

22:23.933 --> 22:26.602
Aw, you don't tell me what to do!

22:26.685 --> 22:27.978
I'll get him!

22:31.065 --> 22:32.566
There's my only living son.

22:32.650 --> 22:33.692
You stay good, Bill.

22:33.776 --> 22:35.945
I failed your brother,
but you're turning out great.

22:36.028 --> 22:38.572
Oh. Be right back!

22:38.656 --> 22:40.908
Why do they all run from me?

22:42.868 --> 22:44.829
Bill, come back!

22:48.874 --> 22:50.000
[panting]

22:52.503 --> 22:53.671
What are you doing?

22:53.754 --> 22:55.673
I have to bury this fucking thing!

22:55.756 --> 22:58.592
I stole, Phillip! Jimmy's gonna kill me!

22:58.676 --> 23:00.261
I beat a cripple!

23:00.344 --> 23:02.721
And it made my pee-pee feel good!

23:04.098 --> 23:08.102
St. Leonard, patron saint of criminals,
horses and women in labor,

23:08.185 --> 23:09.687
please hear my prayer.

23:09.770 --> 23:10.855
Save us from...

23:10.938 --> 23:14.316
- [door opens]
- [Jimmy] No, Dad, no!

23:14.400 --> 23:16.652
You thieving little shit!

23:16.735 --> 23:19.655
- Stealing hockey sticks now?
- It wasn't me!

23:19.738 --> 23:21.365
I fashion my own sticks!

23:21.449 --> 23:23.868
Yeah, it's never you!
It's never you!

23:23.951 --> 23:25.828
You told him your name!
[grunts]

23:25.911 --> 23:29.165
Maybe Catholic military school
will finally straighten you out!

23:29.248 --> 23:30.458
[Jimmy] No! No! No!

23:30.541 --> 23:33.836
[sobbing] No! No! No!

23:36.297 --> 23:37.882
Poor Jimmy.

23:39.383 --> 23:43.345
Fuck Jimmy. He's gone.
We're free!

23:44.263 --> 23:46.807
Yeah, you think you can escape me
'cause you're wearing a cape?

23:46.891 --> 23:49.852
Is that what you think? You don't know
who you're dealing with! Move it!

23:55.191 --> 23:56.692
[rock music playing]

24:02.490 --> 24:05.409
We are Merlin's Monocle!

24:05.493 --> 24:09.079
- [man] Who?
- [woman] Marlin died!

24:09.163 --> 24:11.332
Oh, Kevin.

24:11.415 --> 24:15.711
- Hey, that's my kid up there.
- She's a real looker.

24:15.794 --> 24:18.130
Thanks for getting us the gig,
Bubbe Esther.

24:18.214 --> 24:19.089
What?

24:19.173 --> 24:22.426
Okay, I guess that's it.
Thank you.

24:24.386 --> 24:27.056
Oh, fuck me.

24:28.682 --> 24:30.100
How much shit am I in?

24:30.184 --> 24:33.179
Well, I was planning on grounding you,
but after seeing the end

24:33.214 --> 24:35.022
of your show, I think you
might've been punished enough.

24:35.105 --> 24:39.193
Nobody came to see us.
And I drew five thousand flyers!

24:39.276 --> 24:40.986
This isn't how I dreamed it would be.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.842
That's why they're called dreams.

24:42.843 --> 24:45.658
- Because they're not real. Right?
- Yeah.

24:45.741 --> 24:48.369
You see now why I'm harping
on you to study in school?

24:49.245 --> 24:53.165
- Why you got to be realistic?
- I guess. You're right.

24:53.249 --> 24:57.836
So, you know, you did your best,
you tried hard and you failed.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.763
And there's no shame in striking out.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.342
It's a good thing you learned
that music won't get you anywhere now.

25:03.425 --> 25:05.469
There's still time
to turn your life around.

25:05.553 --> 25:07.805
You'll hit the books,
we'll get you a tutor.

25:07.888 --> 25:10.724
We'll even get you those eyeglasses
you keep saying you need.

25:10.808 --> 25:14.895
- And you'll be on your way to...
- Oh, my God, you guys rocked!

25:14.979 --> 25:16.605
- Really?
- Really?

25:16.689 --> 25:19.587
I'm so glad I came to visit my grandpa

25:19.588 --> 25:23.772
- because your show was bitchin'!
- Thanks. We were okay.

25:23.807 --> 25:26.115
[sighs] I screwed up
the last ten minutes of my solo.

25:27.741 --> 25:31.078
- Uh... Dad, can you...
- Agh...

25:31.161 --> 25:33.581
It's fine.
Go home after this.

25:33.664 --> 25:37.126
- I got to go to work.
- Okay.

25:37.710 --> 25:43.382
Hey, I don't know if you're interested,
but I cut hair at my house.

25:43.465 --> 25:45.843
Want to come over sometime for a haircut?

25:45.926 --> 25:48.721
That'd be cool. Or whatever.

25:48.804 --> 25:50.014
Thank you so much!

25:50.097 --> 25:53.107
- Come over Thursday after school.
- Okay.

25:54.935 --> 25:59.064
- Who's that chick?
- That was Haircut Girl.

25:59.148 --> 26:02.901
- No way.
- She exists!

26:02.985 --> 26:05.779
And my cherry shall be busted!

26:05.863 --> 26:08.240
We have cherries?

26:08.324 --> 26:11.493
- We're famous!
- We got our first groupie!

26:11.577 --> 26:14.288
[Kevin] This is just the beginning, guys!
Nowhere but up from here!

26:14.371 --> 26:16.749
- Oh, yeah!
- All right! Yeah!

26:21.629 --> 26:23.714
[sighs]

26:23.797 --> 26:25.841
