00:20.562 --> 00:22.230
I died when I was 11.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.110
My mom and I were living in Alaska
at the time.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.822
One of her many failed attempts
at reinvention.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.200
I fell through the ice.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.828
I heard it crack

00:36.911 --> 00:40.999
and watched as the water
started to pool around my ladybug boots.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.586
I remember thinking rather calmly:

00:46.212 --> 00:47.797
"I'm about to disappear."

00:52.135 --> 00:53.720
"There are many--

00:53.803 --> 00:56.639
There are a lot of theories
about who rescued me.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.641
Not that I know.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.018
I blocked it all out.

01:00.977 --> 01:05.440
Some say that it was the dog next door
who barked.

01:06.149 --> 01:10.820
Some say my mom finally came home
and remembered that she had a daughter.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.284
Some say that it was me.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.370
That I punched my way through the ice.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.663
Crawled my way out.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.876
But I'm not sure.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.296
Maybe I never made it out of there at all.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.967
Maybe I've been a ghost
all of these years."

01:42.185 --> 01:44.896
And that would make sense.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.191
Because none of you guys
seem to hear me at all.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.946
Thank you so much for--

01:53.530 --> 01:55.532
Uh, it's something I've been working on.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.204
Look at you.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.206
Reading sad words up there.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.542
Thank you for covering for me.

02:05.625 --> 02:09.629
Thirteen wants another
pitcher of Bud. Six wants cheesecake.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.965
Uh, I have a question.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.759
Who is that guy right there.
Do you know him?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.178
Sean.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.349
You don't know Sean?

02:21.432 --> 02:22.976
Bartends at the Swan.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.355
Would you mind going
and seeing what he's reading?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.274
Are you serious?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.449
-Can I get a pitcher of Bud for 13?
-Sure.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.085
Love is a Dog-- Something.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.379
Love is a Dog from Hell. Bukowski.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.427
Uh-oh.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.016
Alex?

03:05.393 --> 03:06.227
Nate.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.355
From Neptune. From brunch?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.152
Nate.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.654
Uh, Nate. Right. Of course.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.531
Hi. Of course I run into you.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.449
Hey. Yeah.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.578
I was just catching the ferry
going into work early and I was like:

03:24.162 --> 03:26.873
"Whoa. That girl looks like Alex."

03:26.956 --> 03:28.124
And it is.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
-This must be Maddy.
-Yeah.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.961
Recognize her from Facebook.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.297
What are you guys doing
camped out on the floor?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.174
-What are you, stranded?
-Ah, no.

03:36.257 --> 03:41.179
We just got to the ferry a little early,
so we're taking a little catnap.

03:41.262 --> 03:46.017
-What time do you have? My phone died.
-05.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.145
Why do you have a vacuum?

03:51.481 --> 03:54.108
I'm just really
into vacuums right now, Nate.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.861
Like to keep one close.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.031
Okay. Well, the ferry's here,

04:00.114 --> 04:03.701
so why don't I just help you out
with your stuff?

04:04.827 --> 04:07.413
That's okay.
We're taking a different ferry.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.665
Thank you, though.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.124
It was good to see you.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.835
What other ferry?

04:14.003 --> 04:17.298
I'm gonna let her sleep, is all.
She's just, uh--

04:18.299 --> 04:22.220
That's all I meant. She's sleepy.
I'm gonna let her sleep a little.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.813
Listen, I don't have to go
into work this early.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.191
Um, can I give you a ride somewhere?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.110
Maybe buy us breakfast?

04:37.610 --> 04:41.364
Oh. Uh, no. I'm-- We're good. Yeah.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.706
Come on. I got a phone charger in the car.
We'll hit Starbucks.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.750
Let me help you out.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.050
Hey, Maddy. You wanna watch Frozen?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.345
I got it on a continuous loop
back there for my son.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.306
-No.
-Mm.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.642
She's very afraid of the snow creature.
No Frozen, sorry.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.811
Oh. Okay. Um...

05:12.812 --> 05:15.857
Ah. Brady loves that part
because he's a psychopath.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.945
Is he your only one?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.196
Yes.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.743
And his mom and I just got divorced,
so that's a hard yes.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.287
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.705
Don't be.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.582
It was amicable.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.336
She really looks like Sean.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.380
You think?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.341
Yeah, I mean, that's a good thing, right?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.925
Look like the great...

05:44.260 --> 05:45.595
Sean Boyd.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.264
Hey, Alaska.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.766
Hi.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.393
So you're still writing?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.355
Oh, yeah.

06:00.068 --> 06:00.902
All the time.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.654
Because you're so talented, I mean--

06:04.906 --> 06:07.909
-You still working at Neptune?
-No, no.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.244
I'm a structural engineer now.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.372
Remember, I was in grad school at U-Dub?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.832
Honestly, I can't even swim.
I'm just boned.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.209
I would've just sunk.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.295
Yeah, I joined this small firm in Seattle.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.674
I mean, maybe not that small.
We just opened a second office in L.A.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.763
-Wow.
-Yeah.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.234
You don't know
where the 360 area code is, do you?

06:41.818 --> 06:43.194
Merritt, I think?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.829
Do you want me to help you out?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.790
No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
Thank you.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.876
-Thank you, really, though.
-Okay.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.130
Come here, baby girl. I know.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.132
Come here.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.466
-What?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.262
Hey.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.639
-Thank you so much, really.
-Yeah.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.851
-Yeah, here. Keep it.
-Oh. Um...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.770
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I've got more.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.188
And you got my number, right?

07:19.272 --> 07:23.818
So call me if you need anything.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.319
What do you say, Mad?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.738
You wanna say goodbye?
Wanna say thank you?

07:27.822 --> 07:28.990
Oh!

07:30.032 --> 07:31.117
Okay.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.916
Oh, wow.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.793
So strong.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.879
Strong, strong, strong.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.927
Yeah? If this is another summons,
you can shove it up your ass.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.928
It's Alex.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.264
-Who?
-Alex.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.642
Oh. You. The Dyson thief.
Don't bring that kid in here.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.311
Look, I can explain.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.479
I can explain too.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.732
Value Maids. Ignore. Value Maids. Ignore.
Who am I? Your phone.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.234
-I got into a car accident.
-Sure you did.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.819
No, I really did.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.822
I got into a car accident on Route 20
and I totaled my car.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.326
-Got a photo right here.
-Jesus Christ, that's your car?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.785
I stand corrected.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.413
But I still can't pay you,
if that's why you're here.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.623
I had an emergency.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.918
Client doesn't give a shit.
All she knows is you didn't come back.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.711
I don't get paid, you don't get paid.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.881
I did that cleaning, Yolanda.
I busted my ass for three hours.

08:26.964 --> 08:27.924
I didn't stop to pee.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.967
I bought the supplies, paid for the gas.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.304
I lost two hours of my life
going back and forth to Regina's house.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.722
Hey, sucks for me too.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.433
I'm out the money
and a very valuable client.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.393
Life shits on your balls sometimes.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.027
Okay, are you sure there's not
any other shift that you have left open?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.655
-I'll take anything.
-I'll keep you in mind.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.075
I really need this work.
I really need this pay stub.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.994
I promise you I won't mess up again.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.705
Leave your uniform there, hon?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.265
-Hello?
-Is this Alex Russell?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.183
Um, who's this?

09:19.267 --> 09:22.228
This is John Marshal, ma'am.
I represent Sean Boyd.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.022
You have an attorney
or can we speak directly?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.358
I'm sorry, who is this?

09:27.441 --> 09:28.859
I'm Mr. Boyd's attorney, ma'am.

09:28.943 --> 09:33.114
I'm calling to notify you that Mr. Boyd
has filed an emergency petition

09:33.197 --> 09:36.534
with the Family Court of Ludlow County
to have his child, Maddy Boyd,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.536
returned
to his custodial care immediately.

09:38.619 --> 09:42.373
The court has called a preliminary
hearing for tomorrow at 10 a.m.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.916
If you fail to show,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.378
he will file a further petition to forgo
all your parental rights to Maddy.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.839
Do you understand everything
you've been notified of?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.555
Sean didn't even graduate high school.
How does he have a lawyer?

09:57.638 --> 10:00.433
Anyone can get one.
All you need is 1500 bucks.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.476
Sean doesn't have 1500 bucks.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.938
Well, somebody does. His family?
I don't know, that's not your problem.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.691
Your problem is you don't have a roof
over her head.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.526
That's not gonna look good in court.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.405
We need to get you
off the streets immediately.

10:14.488 --> 10:18.618
There's no beds at Shawgit,
not that you'd get there without a car.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.537
-Yolanda advance you that pay stub?
-Nope.

10:22.913 --> 10:26.125
So we still can't qualify you
for transitional housing.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.003
There's beds
at the domestic violence shelter,

10:29.086 --> 10:31.505
but you said you're not DV?

10:31.589 --> 10:36.177
Yeah. I'd really hate to take a bed
from somebody's that been abused for real.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.349
"Abused for real." What does that mean?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.602
Beaten up. Hurt.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.233
And what does fake abuse look like?
Intimidation?

10:52.485 --> 10:53.361
Threats?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.112
Control?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.579
You need to call the DV hotline yourself.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.792
They'll send a cab around to the
closest police station to pick you up.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.710
Call and say what?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.297
"Help."

11:45.121 --> 11:45.955
Thank you.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.836
You're Alex, this is Maddy?

11:51.919 --> 11:55.005
I'm Denise. We spoke on the phone.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.676
You're here. You can breathe.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.554
Good, baby girl.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.306
We do a lot of breathing here. Yes, we do.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.767
You carry Maddy, I'll get your bag.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.044
-Mm-hm.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.515
This is Cal, he's always here.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.685
On his desk is the sign-out book
where you sign,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.479
in and out.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.981
Now, your phone goes here.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.734
Just check the location is off first.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.655
-I'm not allowed to use my phone?
-You can use it all you want.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.657
It'll be right here for you.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.702
Just have to leave the premises to use it.
Walk a block or two.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.998
Protecting the confidentiality
of our location is our top priority.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.755
No.

13:24.094 --> 13:24.929
No.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.184
I wanna go home.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.522
This whole place is just for us?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.106
It certainly is.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.275
Look at this.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.822
-Look how cute that is. Look at--
-No. No.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.782
I'm sorry, she's very sleepy.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.868
I'll have them bring dinner
so you can settle in.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.914
And a change of clothes for her.
What is she, size 3?

13:51.997 --> 13:52.873
Thank you.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.461
-Wow.
-No, no, no.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.172
Come here. Check this out.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.431
Hi. I live up in 23.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.516
Try this.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.103
The woman who lived in 3 left them behind
when she moved out,

14:14.186 --> 14:16.146
so maybe your daughter will like them.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.817
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

14:26.490 --> 14:30.244
-I have something I think you might like.
-Mm-mm.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.040
Do you wanna see what it is? Do you?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.877
You want a special surprise?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.797
All right. Well...

14:46.427 --> 14:49.263
-What in tarnation?
-What?

14:49.346 --> 14:52.266
-What are they?
-Oh, my goodness.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.268
Look at them. Look at all the ponies.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.438
Look at these ponies.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.441
-Yellow? Okay?
-What?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.359
It's standing up.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.236
Oh, my gosh.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.655
Oh, my gosh.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.770
-Hey.
-I wanted to come by

16:19.853 --> 16:22.564
-and say thank you so much.
-I'll come out.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.034
So?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.953
Did the ponies work? It sounded like it.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.539
Absolutely. You're a lifesaver.
Amazing. Thank you.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.624
They are so fucking creepy, right?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.043
I showed my son and he was like, "Nah."

16:44.586 --> 16:45.921
Super creepy, yeah,

16:46.005 --> 16:49.675
I guess I don't know why anyone
would have that many ponies.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.345
Girl, I got a lot of questions
about the girl who lived in 3.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.806
Smelled like she was cooking turds.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.976
I'm Alex, by the way.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.770
I'm sorry, I don't know
if I'm supposed to...

17:01.854 --> 17:03.313
use real names here.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.025
That's up to you.
Some girl's calling herself

17:06.108 --> 17:09.194
Yasmina Jade Skye over there,
and we all know that's bullshit.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.530
But my real name is Danielle.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.867
My real name is Alex.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.202
How old is your son?

17:17.286 --> 17:20.122
Oh, he's 7. He's in first grade.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.707
How about yours?

17:22.458 --> 17:25.002
She's almost 3. Yeah.

17:29.339 --> 17:34.178
-Uh, your eyelashes are very beautiful.
-Oh, I know, right? Shelter chic.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.141
Trying to be my own advertisement
'cause I do lashes as a side hustle.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.935
Trying to get more serious
so it could be my main hustle.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.687
Like be a boss babe.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.148
"Lashes by Danielle." No, no, no.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.358
"Luscious Lashes by Danielle."

17:50.027 --> 17:51.195
I love it, yeah.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.532
Do you need anything?

17:57.117 --> 18:00.079
Um, no, we're all set. Um...

18:03.749 --> 18:06.168
Actually-- Unless--

18:07.461 --> 18:08.337
Um...

18:08.879 --> 18:12.382
I'm sorry, you don't have anything
that I could wear to court, do you?

18:13.133 --> 18:14.009
Girl.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.512
Girl, come on!

18:16.595 --> 18:19.807
We're gonna do your makeup
and your lashes too.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.410
Oh.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.329
-She brought Maddy.
-Oh, fuck.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.833
Maddy Moo.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.210
-Hey!
-Daddy!

18:48.293 --> 18:49.461
Hey, baby.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.590
So good to see you.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.135
Okay?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.470
Brought her to court?

18:59.638 --> 19:00.889
Why are you wearing a suit?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.308
Why are you wearing a cheetah?

19:04.893 --> 19:07.855
Look, kids aren't allowed in court.
It's against the rules.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.232
Why's your whole family here?
Why's Ethan here?

19:11.150 --> 19:14.319
To support me. It's been hell for me.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.946
It's been hell for you?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.282
Come on.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.076
We all just want
what's best for Maddy here.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.371
We want what's best for Maddy.
Both of us, yeah.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.875
We can't afford food
and you can afford a lawyer.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.546
-Sorry. We should head in.
-Thanks, John.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.882
Thanks, John.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.136
I'll stay out here with her
since you decided to bring her.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.639
-Come to me!
-Lovely to see you, Doreen.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.058
Here's Schmariel.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.811
Mommy will see you real soon, okay?

19:48.562 --> 19:49.605
Okay.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.898
I love you!

20:20.344 --> 20:24.056
Case 549GRT, Boyd v. Russell.

20:25.849 --> 20:31.063
Regarding emergency petition 5937-G
filed by Sean Boyd,

20:31.146 --> 20:35.275
this is a motion for an ex parte order
to return Maddy Boyd, age 2,

20:35.359 --> 20:39.154
to the care of her father Sean Boyd,
effective immediately.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.280
Yes, Your Honor.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.574
Has an amendment
to the Family Plan been filed

20:42.658 --> 20:43.742
and paperwork served?

20:43.825 --> 20:45.577
It's been filed, and with your permission,

20:45.661 --> 20:48.497
since we were unable to reach Ms. Russell,
we will serve her at this time.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.499
-Granted.
-So served.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.710
On what grounds should an
ex parte of Maddy Boyd be considered?

20:53.794 --> 20:56.546
Your Honor, Ms. Russell
has failed to legal, legal, legal,

20:56.630 --> 20:59.675
and she's legally legal, we ask the court
to legal, legal, legal.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.762
-I see, and that's legal.
-Very legal, legal, legal.

21:03.845 --> 21:04.680
Ms. Russell.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.893
-I'm sorry, judge, I don't understand--
-Commissioner.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.814
I'm not a judge. I'm a court commissioner.
And I asked you what your plan is.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.192
My plan?

21:18.026 --> 21:21.822
To provide for Maddy, you removed her
from her home in the middle of the night,

21:21.905 --> 21:25.242
have withheld and concealed
her whereabouts from Mr. Boyd

21:25.325 --> 21:29.371
for more than 72 hours,
and have neither a home nor income.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.455
What's your plan?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.085
I'm figuring that out.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.546
-Do you have a roof over her head?
-Yes.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.215
We're currently at McMullin House.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.343
That's the DV shelter.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.767
Yes. We were referred there
by Social Services

21:50.851 --> 21:52.644
after I told them how unsafe we were.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.771
Your Honor, this is out of left field.

21:54.855 --> 21:58.400
My client has never laid a hand
on this woman or his child.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.528
Ms. Russell, did you file
a police report on the night you left?

22:02.571 --> 22:03.405
No.

22:03.488 --> 22:07.159
Do you have third-party witnesses
to confirm this allegation?

22:07.701 --> 22:08.535
No.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.371
Have you ever filed
a police report at any time

22:11.455 --> 22:14.207
documenting the domestic abuse
of Mr. Boyd?

22:19.504 --> 22:21.506
-No.
-May I throw some more legal at you?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.716
Oh, yes, legal me.

22:22.799 --> 22:26.553
She failed to legal, legal,
which is legally legal per legal.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.180
Ms. Russell, is this true?

22:30.098 --> 22:34.061
You were in a car accident with Mr. Boyd's
child in the back seat unattended?

22:36.772 --> 22:39.691
Yes. I was looking for her mermaid.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.445
Mr. Boyd, the court grants your emergency
petition for an ex parte order

22:43.528 --> 22:45.572
to return Maddy to your custody.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.658
We will reconvene in seven days.
Adjourned.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.248
I'm sorry. What did you decide?

22:55.832 --> 22:58.835
You have seven days
until the temporary custody hearing.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.670
Use that time to obtain employment

23:00.754 --> 23:03.298
and create a cogent plan
to provide for Maddy.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.966
Maddy stays with Sean until then?

23:07.344 --> 23:11.306
You can still see her with a third-party
neutral supervisor present.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.936
-No--
-Ms. Russell, we're adjourned.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.190
Case 339GRF.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.030
Maddy, Maddy, Maddy, hey.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.031
Hey, Maddy.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.534
Hi, honey. Hi, honey.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.620
-Daddy tell you where you're going?
-Home.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.206
You're gonna go home,
but just for a week, okay?

23:36.289 --> 23:38.333
And then we're going back
to the pony house.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.712
And I'm gonna come and do bath time
with you every single night.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.802
Come on, Maddy.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.108
Hey, how did it go?

24:03.984 --> 24:05.068
Uh--

24:10.907 --> 24:12.200
-Alex.

24:14.995 --> 24:15.829
Alex.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.207
Are you okay?

24:23.336 --> 24:26.590
Those fuckers.
How long did the court say he gets her?

24:28.925 --> 24:30.510
-How long?
-A week.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.012
Seven days?

24:32.679 --> 24:36.057
Girl, that's not bad.
I heard so much worse than that.

24:36.683 --> 24:40.228
Seven-- You could do seven days.
That's like seven sleeps.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.451
Do you get to see her?

24:55.452 --> 24:56.745
For bath time.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.582
That's good, Mama.
They don't always do that, you know.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.295
Court gave me no visitation rights
the first time I left Carl.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.715
Calling me unfit...

25:10.967 --> 25:14.721
Those suits can say whatever they want.
But you are a great mom.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.850
-No. I never should have left.
-Yes, you should have.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.311
He's a great dad.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.149
He's a great dad and Maddy adores him.
They're home right now snuggling together.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.860
And I'm alone in a shelter
I don't belong in.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.571
-You're here because he abused you.
-He didn't abuse me.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.991
He punched a wall beside my head,
and I didn't do anything about it,

25:35.075 --> 25:37.536
and I didn't file a report,
and I didn't call the cops.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.995
Fuck the police report.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.831
Punching a wall next to you
is emotional abuse.

25:42.958 --> 25:47.170
Before they bite, they bark.
Before they hit you, they hit near you.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.006
Next time, it was gonna be your face,
and you know that.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.221
I don't know what I know.

25:57.013 --> 26:01.351
Okay, all right, stop it. Stop it.
Come here. Look at me. Hey, look at me.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.436
Look at this.

26:08.942 --> 26:09.776
You see that?

26:10.610 --> 26:12.946
This motherfucker tried to strangle me.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.991
You think it started out like that?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.784
You think, on our first date,

26:17.867 --> 26:21.705
he was all, "Pass the salt.
Someday I'm gonna strangle you, girl"?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.081
No.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.918
It grows, like mold.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.132
I lost Maddy.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.679
Okay. We're getting up.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.681
Come on, you gotta get up now.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.516
Come on. Let's go.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.608
Oh, you think I don't know this carpet?

26:51.526 --> 26:53.069
I've been on this carpet.

26:54.487 --> 26:58.783
I've lost weeks of my life to this carpet.

26:59.659 --> 27:03.246
And you gotta get up off this carpet,
Alex, and you gotta fight.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.541
Come on, vámonos, let's go. Get up.

27:07.125 --> 27:07.959
Get up.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.964
Get up! I can't slap you, bitch, 'cause
we in a DV shelter, but you gotta get up!

27:14.299 --> 27:15.258
Get up!

27:15.342 --> 27:17.177
-Fuck, okay. Okay.
-Get up!

27:17.761 --> 27:21.973
'Cause seven days is not that long, okay?
You gotta get yourself a DV advocate.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.435
File an account of abuse for the court.
You gotta get your ducks rowed up.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.481
-But instead you're lying here.
-Yeah. Um...

27:32.025 --> 27:34.527
They're just not gonna listen to me, so...

27:35.445 --> 27:39.949
Look at you. "They're not gonna
listen." Whine, whine, whine. Get angry!

27:41.618 --> 27:45.830
You need to dig in there
and pull that shit out, Mama!

27:46.581 --> 27:48.541
What he did to you was fucked up!

27:50.085 --> 27:52.545
And you better start getting
mad as shit about it.

27:58.176 --> 28:02.514
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna fucking help you, all right?

28:03.515 --> 28:04.599
I'm gonna...

28:05.684 --> 28:08.061
Let's see. Tell me one thing
that you're angry about.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.896
Just one thing that pisses you off.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.818
-Um...
-Could be anything. Whatever you want.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.112
-I appreciate what you're doing.
-No.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.698
You gotta tell me
one thing you're angry about.

28:20.907 --> 28:21.908
Anything.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.619
-Quick.
-I'm, um--

28:26.705 --> 28:29.874
-Regina pisses me off.
-Great. Who's Regina?

28:29.958 --> 28:32.377
I cleaned her house on Fisher Island,

28:33.878 --> 28:36.715
and she refused to pay me
and then I lost my job.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.802
So you did the work
and she didn't pay you?

28:42.429 --> 28:45.515
My God, I bet she lives
in a gorgeous-ass house too.

28:46.015 --> 28:50.103
In her Lululemon pants.
With her KitchenAid standing mixer.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.564
-That must make you really angry.
-Yeah.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.024
Good. Get your coat.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.361
Let's go. We're pulling up.
That bitch is gonna pay you.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.865
Let's go.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.383
Hey, there's an open house.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.844
Let's go. Let's fucking go.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.597
We can't go to an open house.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.391
Why not? It's an open house.
The house is open.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.019
-Regina's probably not here, Danielle.
-But her stuff is.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.354
I mean, how much
did she fleece you for anyway?

29:33.938 --> 29:34.939
37.50.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.736
We're doing this for 37.50?
I could have Venmo'd you that.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.780
-You're right. Let's go back.
-No.

29:41.863 --> 29:46.159
No. Fuck that. It's the principle, okay?
You earned that pathetic 37.50.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.495
We're gonna get you
37.50 worth of something.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.288
Danielle, I don't steal.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.542
Who said anything about stealing? Hmm?

29:59.589 --> 30:01.800
How is this not prepping
to steal something?

30:01.883 --> 30:04.469
What? Girl, we're just making space.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.229
-Are you here for the open house?
-I'm gonna stop you right there, Jackie.

30:14.312 --> 30:17.774
I think the real question is,
are you ready to make a sale?

30:24.197 --> 30:27.325
My wife and I are friends of Regina's
from spin class.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.621
She said that we had to come by
and check out her designer nursery.

30:32.622 --> 30:36.292
Gorgeous. Eco-friendly, heated floors.
May I have your names?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.506
Taylor Swiftman.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.717
Yasmina Jade Skye.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.011
Oh, lovely.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.516
Welcome. Make yourselves at home.

30:51.599 --> 30:55.603
My associate's in there to answer
any questions and show you around.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.398
Is Regina home?

30:58.481 --> 31:01.568
She stepped out. I'll make sure
to let you know you say hi, Taylor.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.281
Oh, my God.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.700
What do these people do?

31:08.783 --> 31:09.659
No clue.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.161
Well, damn, girl.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.123
This house is clean. You're good.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.544
-Thank you. Can we get out?
-Okay.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.214
So you distract him, and I'll look around.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.138
It's gorgeous.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.231
Hello.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.530
Do you have any questions?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.743
Uh, it's a beautiful property.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.746
Yes. So much light.

31:59.250 --> 32:03.129
-These walls look solid.
-They're earthquake retro-fitted.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.799
The roof goes over the whole house.

32:08.635 --> 32:12.055
It doesn't cover the backyard,
if that's what you mean.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.309
Well, honey,

32:17.185 --> 32:20.605
it's lovely, but we're gonna have
to think it over, so...

32:28.154 --> 32:29.614
Okay, so don't be mad.

32:30.073 --> 32:33.326
But I saw something in her office
I had to take for you.

32:33.409 --> 32:34.661
No. No.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.876
-Her business card.
-No, that's not it.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.630
That's just so we have her number,
so we can text her. The item's in my bag.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.299
Take a look.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.928
-You stole her dog.
-No.

32:52.011 --> 32:55.223
She came to me, okay? She was
just chilling there in her kennel.

32:55.306 --> 32:59.018
-"Hey, buddy." "Hello, friend."
-No. You can't steal the woman's dog.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.730
We're not stealing her. Just showing her
the sights. We're gonna give her treats,

33:02.814 --> 33:05.358
then I'll text that bitch
to bring 37.50 or we cut a paw.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.652
Turn around. I'll throw him over the gate.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.529
Him? Oh, no.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.448
-Are you a boy?
-It's not funny.

33:12.532 --> 33:16.035
I was already in court once today.
I'm not getting in trouble for a dog.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.539
-Okay, okay.
-Pull over, and I'll call this number.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.500
I'll call her, and I'll say
I found your dog on the street.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.961
-It's not funny.
-Sorry. It's funny.

33:29.799 --> 33:33.136
Regina's on her way.
She's gonna be here in five minutes.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.892
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin your dog fun.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.270
I just can't get arrested right now.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.647
-No. It's not that. I--

33:46.524 --> 33:49.944
This is the second call.
The first was when I was in line.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.446
Can you hold it?

33:51.529 --> 33:53.489
-I don't want it in my hand.
-Yes.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.784
-Can you press Ignore?
-Mm-hm.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.370
Ignored. Done. Done.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.250
It's just-- His face, you know.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.379
-Why don't you turn it off?
-This is what he does.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.382
He says, "I love you. I wanna see my boy."

34:13.926 --> 34:16.095
He's just gonna call again. Fuck it.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.726
You know what the fucked-up part is?
I want him to see Max.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.728
It's his son.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.778
Be right back.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.698
The fuck are you calling me for, huh?

34:36.657 --> 34:37.533
Oh, yeah?

34:43.289 --> 34:44.499
Mr. Darcy.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.710
Oh! Oh, thank God.

34:52.298 --> 34:56.344
I don't know how he got out of his kennel.
How did you get out of your kennel?

34:56.427 --> 34:58.513
Oh. Where did you find him?

34:59.347 --> 35:02.100
Uh, the street. Yeah.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.602
How did he get all the way over here?

35:06.813 --> 35:07.814
Dogs run far.

35:08.856 --> 35:12.068
But your legs are so short,
Mr. Darcy, yes.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.573
-I'm glad I was able to help you.
-Oh, yes.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.785
Thank you so much, truly.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.166
You don't recognize me?

35:28.584 --> 35:29.460
I'm sorry?

35:31.003 --> 35:32.463
Uh... I'm your maid.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.174
I cleaned your house.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.261
Right. You, um...

35:39.011 --> 35:41.722
You passed out in the nursery.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.765
You stiffed me.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.143
Oh, my...

35:46.227 --> 35:48.146
Oh, my God. Is this...? What...?

35:49.438 --> 35:50.815
What is this?

35:53.901 --> 35:56.112
Did you steal my dog?

35:57.947 --> 36:01.617
My slightly insane friend borrowed your
dog for a potential hostage situation.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.202
But I'm returning him to you.

36:03.286 --> 36:07.081
And here you go,
giving your dog back. I'm the hero.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.877
Oh, my fucking God!

36:10.960 --> 36:12.378
I am calling the police.

36:13.921 --> 36:18.551
Call the police, yeah. Call the police,
and I'll tell them that you're a thief.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.636
You owe me $37.50.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.806
Unbelievable.
I do not negotiate with criminals.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.016
Pay me what you owe me.

36:25.099 --> 36:28.936
I am not paying you one dime.
You didn't even come back to finish.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.356
No, I did. I came back to your house.
I was on my way back to your house.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.692
I got into
a horrible car accident on Route 20.

36:34.775 --> 36:37.278
And my daughter and I,
we've been living in that car.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.405
So we became homeless.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.200
And then,
because you're a cheap motherfucker,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.577
I couldn't feed her, I couldn't house her,

36:44.660 --> 36:48.873
and I couldn't get her off of the floor
of the ferry station, so then...

36:49.624 --> 36:51.959
this morning,
the court took her away from me.

36:53.085 --> 36:53.961
Yeah.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.636
You lost your dog for five minutes,
and I lost my daughter.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.514
You can go fuck yourself.

37:20.196 --> 37:24.242
Keep on going down,
and it's on the right. The yellow one.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.284
Gotcha.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.495
Okay.

37:39.131 --> 37:43.219
This is where you were living?
No wonder you were sweating out $37.50.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.528
Five hours, 30 minutes, nine seconds.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.281
Wow. Sweet.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.366
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.830
Take it off.

38:10.913 --> 38:15.751
Too bad I can't feel my nuts. Otherwise,
I'd give you a proper show, Alaska.

38:18.337 --> 38:19.255
Yeah.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.639
How many hours are you
supposed to be able to bike?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.975
Not hours, miles. Forty.

38:31.517 --> 38:33.686
With three months' worth of gear
on my bike.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.860
You supposed to blow through
the whole syllabus before class starts?

38:40.943 --> 38:44.196
Why else would they put it online?
It's nerd catnip.

38:47.074 --> 38:47.950
Anything good?

38:48.826 --> 38:52.163
A River Runs Through It. Makes me
wanna move to Montana immediately.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.750
Good thing you are, then.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.002
I'm not gone yet.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.035
What is it, man?

39:33.037 --> 39:37.124
I mean, how many more times am I gonna
have to listen to that sad-ass pity party?

39:37.958 --> 39:40.669
-Hey, Danielle, uh...
-Yeah?

39:43.005 --> 39:45.091
This trailer wasn't always quite this bad.

39:45.174 --> 39:48.511
I don't want you to think
this is what I chose for my daughter.

39:52.681 --> 39:57.770
I think your daughter's lucky.
That's what I think. She's got you.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.486
Look, I know
that bitch didn't cough it up today,

40:05.569 --> 40:08.322
but you should feel
really good about yourself.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.991
You should feel fucking proud of yourself.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.743
You started fighting back.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.580
You started standing up for yourself.

40:16.664 --> 40:20.584
You were yelling, "Go fuck yourself"
in a random parking lot.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.511
Thank you for getting me off that carpet.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.305
I got you.

40:35.349 --> 40:38.269
You sure you ready to go back in there?
It's soon.

40:38.352 --> 40:41.689
I promised Maddy I'd do bath time.
That's our thing.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.524
Want me to come back?

40:44.442 --> 40:48.779
-No. I'll walk.
-Okay, boo, don't miss curfew.

40:48.863 --> 40:52.533
Oh, yup. I won't. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

41:07.214 --> 41:09.008
-Hi, Doreen.
-Hi.

41:09.091 --> 41:12.428
-I'm here to do bath time with Maddy.
-We already did it.

41:13.804 --> 41:14.972
It's45.

41:15.055 --> 41:18.893
Well, she got dirty on the playground,
and so we did it early.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.147
Can I come in and tuck her in, then?

41:23.230 --> 41:26.442
She's already down.
Sean did it before he went to work.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.613
She's asleep at45?

41:30.696 --> 41:34.700
She had a cough, so we gave her
Robitussin to help her sleep. Okay?

41:35.367 --> 41:38.287
No. She can't have cough syrup.
She's a baby. What do you mean?

41:38.370 --> 41:41.999
I gave it to all my kids when
they were her age, and she's fine. Okay?

41:42.750 --> 41:43.834
Have a good night.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.438
Sorry.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.451
Danielle!

45:05.035 --> 45:05.869
Danielle!

45:06.537 --> 45:07.538
Regina paid.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.557
Denise, hey, where's Danielle?

45:28.475 --> 45:31.186
-Let's meet in my office to speak.
-Uh--

45:31.895 --> 45:34.231
-Did you kick her out? What happened?
-No.

45:34.314 --> 45:36.775
Okay, well, she's gone.
All her stuff. She's gone.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.153
I apologize, baby girl.

45:39.236 --> 45:42.740
Can you go on down to apartment 23,
and I'll meet you there in a sec?

45:42.823 --> 45:43.741
Let's go, guys.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.000
Danielle checked out. She left.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.376
What do you mean?

45:54.460 --> 45:58.088
She left shelter, early this morning.
That's all I can say.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.465
Okay. Where'd she go?

46:07.055 --> 46:08.223
Uh...

46:13.479 --> 46:15.063
Denise, he strangled her.

46:16.857 --> 46:17.941
This happens.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.361
They go back more often than not.

46:22.821 --> 46:26.909
It takes most women seven tries
before they finally leave.

46:26.992 --> 46:28.911
This was Danielle's third time here.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.416
It took me five tries.

47:34.726 --> 47:38.689
The armchair in the front lawn
of our trailer belongs to me.

47:39.648 --> 47:44.111
And you can't tell under all the mold,
but it's pink velvet.

47:45.362 --> 47:48.615
And when I moved in to Sean's,
it came with me.

47:51.201 --> 47:54.580
And when I told him I was pregnant...

47:55.873 --> 47:57.916
he sat me down on that chair...

47:58.584 --> 48:02.045
and he brought me a cup of mint tea...

48:02.880 --> 48:07.092
and he told me that he would
hold my hand every step of the way.

48:10.262 --> 48:11.430
All tenderness.

48:16.768 --> 48:17.978
But then...

48:19.313 --> 48:24.026
when I told him
that I wasn't gonna get an abortion...

48:26.320 --> 48:29.740
he took the chair...

48:30.574 --> 48:35.704
and all the rest of my belongings,
and he threw them out into the rain.

48:37.915 --> 48:43.420
And he screamed at me,
and he told me that I was a fucking whore.

48:44.713 --> 48:48.467
And he said that
I was ruining his bike trip

48:48.550 --> 48:50.761
and that I was also ruining his life.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.475
And he also said that, uh...

48:59.728 --> 49:01.271
he would never forgive me.

49:06.318 --> 49:07.486
And he hasn't.

49:08.278 --> 49:11.114
What the fuck are you thinking?
Fucking bitch!

49:11.198 --> 49:14.242
Think for a fucking second, Alex!
For a fucking second!

49:17.204 --> 49:19.748
And I've been afraid of him
every day since.

49:24.878 --> 49:25.837
Anyway...

49:28.006 --> 49:30.384
Just something I'm working on right now.

49:43.105 --> 49:44.106
Notes?
