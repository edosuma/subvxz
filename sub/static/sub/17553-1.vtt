00:24.758 --> 00:26.248
NINJAAAA-GO!

01:19.546 --> 01:21.514
Do you have the golden scroll, Lloyd?

01:21.682 --> 01:25.414
I sure do, Kai.
But I don't know what it says.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.520
Can anyone help me read it?

01:27.688 --> 01:32.819
We can because reading
is the first step to every adventure.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.553
Go reading go!

01:36.797 --> 01:39.823
And, cut. Brilliance plus perfection.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.561
Clean up, little fellows, and make some
headway here. That's a wrap!

01:43.737 --> 01:46.798
A wrap? ljust got here. Dareth said--

01:47.074 --> 01:48.940
Hey, hey, there's my boys.

01:49.109 --> 01:53.012
I knew you could Spinjitzu,
but that acting knocked me out.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.372
Oh. Hey, sweetheart.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.711
Mind sticking around for a segment
to teach girls how to apply make-up?

01:57.985 --> 02:00.579
You're gonna need make-up
when I rearrange your face!

02:00.921 --> 02:03.618
Easy! Nya's one of us now.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.849
There's no reason
she should be treated differently.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.654
No reason?
You added a girl to the group.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.730
You know how much that hurts your image?
You're a boy band. A hunk machine.

02:13.533 --> 02:18.972
No, we're equals. Our power comes from no
one being more important than the other.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.575
Important, no. Irresistible? Debatable.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.272
Oh, my God, it is him.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.536
He winked at me!

02:26.747 --> 02:30.081
I don't tell ya how to do your business,
don't tell me how to do mine.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.446
Remember how every time you saved
Ninjago no one cared?

02:33.620 --> 02:38.217
Well, now Dareth's in charge
and Dareth says don't change the recipe.

02:38.525 --> 02:42.553
You boys are the face of the franchise,
and now the face of Teen <i>Idol!</i>

02:42.796 --> 02:47.233
"Sensei Lloyd"?
But I'm only a Sensei in training.

02:47.401 --> 02:51.065
And what's this about me and Jay
still fighting over Nya? That's old news.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.706
Who cares if it's real or not?
Isn't this what you've always dreamed of?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.535
<i>You're the hottest thing in Ninjago!</i>

03:03.050 --> 03:06.281
Fold your drawers,
hot off their new LP,

03:06.453 --> 03:09.115
<i>it's the sensei-tion sweeping the nation.</i>

03:09.322 --> 03:11.552
<i>The pop that can't seem to stop.</i>

03:11.758 --> 03:15.217
Here's another number one hit
from Go-Ninja-Go.

03:25.605 --> 03:29.200
My favorite? Easy. Lloyd. He's the best.

03:29.443 --> 03:33.277
I like Kai. He's like, so hot. Literally.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.073
<i>Crime down. Ninja way up.</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:39.819
Who doesn't like these five Ninja?
Correction, six.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.781
Jay. He is so funny. And cute...

03:43.957 --> 03:48.554
I like Cole. I mean, he's a ghost.
You want him, but you can't have him.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.023
Who likes Nya?

03:50.197 --> 03:53.292
Like her? Meh. Do I want to be her?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.526
And get to hang out with them?
Oh, my gosh!

03:59.039 --> 04:04.068
Ah. Just between you and me, Nya.
Jay or Cole?

04:04.277 --> 04:09.681
Honestly, not a chance. We're a team.
Instead, I'd rather talk about...

04:09.850 --> 04:12.547
Uh-huh. Not a chance, really?

04:12.819 --> 04:16.016
Ooh!
- l'm telling you, never gonna happen.

04:16.322 --> 04:20.418
Thane. Definitely Thane.
He'th cool.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.527
Ninjago is safer because they are here,

04:23.697 --> 04:26.098
-hiding in plain sight,
- My mom thays I'm cool.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.028
Waiting to defend us
from wherever evil lurks.

04:28.201 --> 04:33.970
But the real question we all want
to know is, where are the Ninja now?

04:36.042 --> 04:39.410
Look inward...
When one <i>is</i> a ghost,

04:39.679 --> 04:44.048
one may have new abilities.
Focus and discover them.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.345
Whoa!

04:49.523 --> 04:53.016
Did you see me? I disappeared!
I mean, did you not see me?

04:53.226 --> 04:54.557
Very good, Cole.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.889
Only you can unlock what is truly inside.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.328
That is it for today.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.029
Dareth wants me to teach girls
how to cook?

05:06.439 --> 05:08.066
How about I teach them how to do this!

05:13.780 --> 05:14.941
I win again.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.279
Ah.

05:18.485 --> 05:23.480
Mini-Droid chess. What's the tally now?
100 games to none?

05:23.757 --> 05:27.751
Set 'em up, Zane, we're going again!
What's got you so cheery?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.622
Remember back in the Tomb
of the First Spinjitzu Master,

05:30.831 --> 05:33.391
when we all saw the reflection
of our future selves?

05:33.567 --> 05:37.367
- You mean when you couldn't see anything?
- Yeah, it wasn't because I'm a goner.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.199
It's because I can disappear!

05:40.707 --> 05:44.541
Oh, then why don't you make like a ghost
and vanish. I need full concentration.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.814
Oh, touchy are we?
Teach him a lesson, Zane.

05:50.884 --> 05:51.874
<i>wens)</i>

05:52.052 --> 05:55.784
You still haven't told him what you saw
in your future's reflection, have you?

05:59.659 --> 06:01.991
And ruin our friendship? No, thanks.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.562
Besides, even if it were true,
her mind's made up.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.428
It's never gonna happen.
I was fine, until I saw us together.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.732
Now it's all I think about.

06:13.273 --> 06:17.107
Bad day? You are supposed to hit them,
not destroy them.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.109
I'm a girl,
but I'm also a lot of other things.

06:20.347 --> 06:25.114
But what does that matter when everyone
only sees me as one thing: the girl Ninja.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.478
I just want to be given a fair shot.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.748
Why? To make things easier?

06:32.259 --> 06:34.353
The harder it is, the more you will excel.

06:34.628 --> 06:39.259
You'll never be happy if you let the world
define you, you've got to define yourself.

06:39.733 --> 06:44.364
Now again.
And this time, destroy all the targets.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.864
What are you looking at?

06:48.041 --> 06:49.839
See?

06:50.877 --> 06:53.244
Even though it's fate, I still can't win.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.580
Checkmate. Again.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.014
101 to zero.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.980
Sensei's back... And there's trouble.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.416
What is it?
Have they sold out of Kai action figures?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.753
I knew there wasn't enough.

07:07.027 --> 07:12.488
No. It appears when you destroyed the
Cursed Realm, one ghost escaped.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.191
And you know him all too well, Clouse.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.932
<i>Security footage shows him
buying a train ticket</i>

07:19.306 --> 07:22.003
that will arrive in Stiix
in just a few hours.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.768
Clouse? The sorcerer from Chen's Island?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.445
What does he want with Stiix?
That place is just a salvage yard now.

07:28.682 --> 07:33.119
That's why I want you to go there and stop
whatever it is he's planning to do.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.287
But Dareth wanted us to visit
the hospital for that Grant-A-Wish thing.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.684
Hey, we take orders from Sensei Wu,
not Dareth.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.894
Lil' Nelson only has a broken leg.

07:42.195 --> 07:47.156
If his wish is to be a Ninja for a Day,
that day can be tomorrow. Suit up.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.934
They are growing up.

07:49.302 --> 07:55.264
Yes, they are. But I'd still like to
think Ninjago would fall apart without us.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.174
Back to the grind.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.939
Ha! If it weren't for the Bounty,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.947
I don't think
we'd ever get any peace and quiet.

08:08.455 --> 08:12.085
We're just over Ninjago City.
Isn't that where Lil' Nelson is?

08:12.392 --> 08:15.362
What do you say, drop by for a quick stop?
In and out.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.688
We don't have time.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.126
Technically, we do as long as
we don't encounter any problems.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.992
What does Sensei always say?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.930
Never put off till tomorrow
what can be done today?

08:27.574 --> 08:33.570
As a part of the Grant-A-Wish Foundation,
we dub you an Honorary Ninja for the Day.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.010
Aw, lwish I broke both my legs.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.113
Could you stay to sign their casts?

08:41.488 --> 08:44.321
Wish we could, but duty calls.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.619
Not sure how far we'll get,
looks like we've got company.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.721
How did they find us?

08:52.065 --> 08:56.969
"Reply. Of course I'm at the hospital,
my hair is sick. Send."

08:57.270 --> 08:58.431
Are you sending out a Chirp?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.799
Uh, my followers have needs too.

09:01.174 --> 09:05.805
If you recall, I said we would
get to Stiix in time minus any problems.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.340
This constitutes a major problem.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.985
Yeah, well I don't see us flying
out of here with these birds in the sky.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.516
<i>Cole's right. No dragons.</i>

09:17.023 --> 09:19.253
If we're going to escape,
we can't be followed.

09:22.028 --> 09:27.023
His hair is sick. He is here! Whoo!

09:30.837 --> 09:33.772
For Pete's sake, put me down.
I'm a grown-up.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.301
They're coming. What do we do?

09:38.545 --> 09:44.006
You say I'm a Ninja for the Day?
Call me The Purple Ninja!

09:46.386 --> 09:48.787
That hood looks legit. Did you make that?

09:49.055 --> 09:51.922
You have a lot of time on your hands
when you break both your legs.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.190
This way. Double leg! Hyah!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.091
This is as far as I can go.

10:02.402 --> 10:06.032
Follow this up to the rooftop.
From there, take back streets.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.931
I'll hold them off at the pass.

10:08.308 --> 10:12.040
Lil' Nelson, I mean, Purple Ninja, thanks.

10:12.245 --> 10:16.478
No. Thank you. You made my wish come true.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.254
Whew! Looks like we lost them.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.117
But the nearest rooftop
is still too far to jump.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.086
- Airjitzu?
- Whoa!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.485
I just learned how to make a water dragon,

10:29.829 --> 10:31.854
I haven't even earned
my Airjitzu suit yet.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.262
But if we don't leave now,
we'll never get to Stiix to stop Clouse.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.334
We're a team. We stick together.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.595
Thanks, but I can stick up for myself.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.770
He was only trying to be nice.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.735
It's okay, right now
we're just having our first fight.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.570
What do you mean "right now"?
And just what are you implying by "we"?

10:49.849 --> 10:52.409
They're going see us.
Quick, take cover.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.385
Nya, you need to hide too.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.288
Forget what I said, just take my hand.

11:00.894 --> 11:05.764
No. What did you mean when you said "we"?
I'm a Ninja, and I'm nobody's girl.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.735
Just take his hand, Nya.
Or else we're gonna be spotted.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.572
Too late.
So much for stopping Clouse.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.604
Let's just hope he missed his train.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.460
They found us, now what do we do?

11:35.728 --> 11:39.323
Just do what you're doing,
but don't run away from the cameras.

11:39.599 --> 11:43.763
Run toward them.
"Ninja visit hospital," this is gold!

11:44.137 --> 11:46.731
We don't need more publicity,
we need less!

11:46.940 --> 11:49.534
We have to get to Stiix to stop Clouse.

11:49.809 --> 11:53.109
Could be a big scoop. Say no more! Hop in!

12:08.461 --> 12:14.025
No. No. No.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.336
Hmm.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.607
Yes.

12:32.852 --> 12:37.050
The Teapot of Tyrahn.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.494
Work, darn you.

13:06.252 --> 13:12.385
I am free? Where am I?

13:12.892 --> 13:14.053
What year is it?

13:14.560 --> 13:19.828
Nadakhan. It's you. I've freed a genie.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.132
I prefer the term Djinn.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.702
Who cares. I want my three wishes!

13:28.441 --> 13:34.505
I must warn you. You cannot wish for love,
death, and most certainly...

13:35.048 --> 13:37.642
More wishes. Yes, yes, I know the rules.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.685
I wish for my Book of Spells!

13:42.055 --> 13:46.151
Very well. Your wish is yours to keep.

13:53.099 --> 13:57.661
Tricked you! Now with my spells,
who needs more wishes.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.275
Oh! Wha... What's happening?

14:03.343 --> 14:07.075
You should've known the book
was last thrown into a fire.

14:07.413 --> 14:11.907
Perhaps you should wish
for more than a pile of ash.

14:12.418 --> 14:15.251
You conniving genie!

14:15.521 --> 14:20.322
The Djinn! And for your second wish?

14:20.860 --> 14:25.525
There's no way I can defeat those Ninja
if I continue to be a ghost.

14:25.865 --> 14:31.201
I wish... I wish to become mortal again.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.969
Your wish is yours to keep.

14:37.844 --> 14:41.212
Yes, yes, it's working.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.007
I can... I can feel again.

14:46.185 --> 14:51.351
My hands, my head. The pain...

14:52.158 --> 14:56.789
Yes, becoming physical
is a painful process.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.366
I wish it could be over soon,

15:00.533 --> 15:05.300
but right now you're probably thinking
about your last wish.

15:05.772 --> 15:10.175
But the pain is too unbearable
to think clearly.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.104
Wish it all to go away.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.544
I wish it all to go away.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.652
Your wish is yours to keep.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.624
Be careful what you wish for.

15:40.339 --> 15:41.807
<i>I</i> detect no trace of Clouse.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.066
He isn't here.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.741
He could be long gone by now.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.276
But look what I found,
a Kai Action Figure.

15:47.513 --> 15:51.916
Some fan probably lost it. No way anyone
threw this out. Practically priceless.

15:52.518 --> 15:53.679
No sign of Clouse.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.414
<i>NHSAKO". Better keep looking.</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:59.182
Wu's at the Domu Library researching
what Clouse could be looking for.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.992
<i>If I hear of anything,
you'll be the first to know.</i>

16:02.295 --> 16:04.423
Come on, guys. Let's keep our eyes peeled.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.763
Look, another Kai Doll!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.129
There's dozens!

16:27.687 --> 16:30.588
Watch where you're going! Ha!
Nice hair, bozo.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.825
<i>You look lost. Can I be of assistance?</i>

16:34.126 --> 16:36.527
Are you trapped too?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.264
<i>I'm sorry, I don't understand your query.</i>

16:39.565 --> 16:44.127
<i>You are talking to Info-Vision.
Ask a question, and maybe lean answer it.</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:45.498
Where is my crew?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.929
<i>You'll have to be more specific.</i>

16:48.341 --> 16:50.241
The crew of Misfortune's Keep.

16:50.443 --> 16:54.607
<i>Misfortune's</i> Keep. <i>The most feared
pirate ship that ruled the high seas,</i>

16:55.047 --> 16:58.381
taken down <i>by</i> Captain Soto
and <i>his</i> Destiny's Bounty

16:58.584 --> 17:01.246
at the end of
the Era of the Stone Warrior.

17:01.454 --> 17:06.619
<i>The Misfortune's captain, Nadakhan the
Djinn, with power to grant others' wishes,</i>

17:06.826 --> 17:09.089
<i>was trapped in the Teapot of Tyrahn,</i>

17:09.295 --> 17:12.595
<i>while his crew was later marooned
in separate realms.</i>

17:12.964 --> 17:14.126
Separate realms?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.529
<i>After the Ninja
discovered the Realm Crystal</i>

17:16.836 --> 17:18.998
<i>in the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master,</i>

17:19.271 --> 17:22.935
<i>it is common knowledge that
Ninjago is one of 16 realms...</i>

17:23.142 --> 17:25.509
Which realm is Delara in?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.574
<i>No known image of Delara,</i>

17:27.946 --> 17:29.676
Quartermaster of Misfortune's Keep

17:29.849 --> 17:31.613
<i>and love of Nadakhan the Djinn.</i>

17:32.051 --> 17:34.543
<i>Died shortly
after Nadakhan': imprisonment.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:38.748
- Died?
- Died. To expire. To croak. Or <i>to...</i>

17:39.025 --> 17:40.993
Where is this Realm Crystal?

17:41.327 --> 17:42.852
<i>Location is classified.</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:44.826
<i>Since Realm crossing is prohibited.</i>

17:45.031 --> 17:49.127
<i>It is under the protection of Sensei Wu
and the Masters of Spinjitzu.</i>

17:49.435 --> 17:52.132
Then tell me how to find them.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.467
Eh, no sign of Clouse?

17:54.640 --> 17:57.940
I don't get it, you'd think
they'd remember seeing another ghost.

17:58.177 --> 18:01.477
I know, I haven't even been asked
to give a single autograph.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.212
Not that I want the attention.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.879
Where are the Ninja?
<i>This</i> reporter has the answer.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.883
Hey, can you turn it up?

18:10.189 --> 18:12.783
Hey, no one here cares
for them fruit-colored Ninja.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.853
Excuse me, what fruit is black?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.563
- Blackberries?
- Shut it, Jay.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.831
- They're calling it
- Guys, listen.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.069
<i>The Crime Wave of the Century.
Earlier today, Green Ninja Lloyd Garmadon</i>

18:23.336 --> 18:26.203
<i>was caught on tape robbing the City Bank.</i>

18:26.472 --> 18:28.998
Whoa! That looks like me.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.336
<i>And that's not all.
At Mega Monster Amusement Park,</i>

18:32.612 --> 18:35.547
Zane was on a rampage
of vandalism and mayhem.

18:35.748 --> 18:39.616
Hey, wait.
My memory has no recollection of that.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.681
Oh! Someone's pretending to be us.

18:41.887 --> 18:42.945
- But why?
- And how?

18:43.289 --> 18:47.920
<i>I am ashamed lever wore their underwear,
I mean T-shirts.</i>

18:48.194 --> 18:50.094
<i>Any comment about your son's offenses?</i>

18:50.429 --> 18:56.459
<i>Jay would never do this. And if he did,
he had good reason... l hope.</i>

18:56.769 --> 19:00.933
You hope? It wasn't me, Dad! It wasn't me.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.403
<i>Jay... Shh.</i>

19:02.608 --> 19:04.736
You believe 'em? They destroy our village,

19:04.944 --> 19:08.938
act like they saved the place,
and then go around doing as they please.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.548
Yeah! You're right. Ninja, ugh, hate 'em!

19:14.553 --> 19:16.419
Maybe now's a good time to leave.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.682
<i>The Ninja are at large.
They are armed and dangerous.</i>

19:20.059 --> 19:24.223
<i>And they have legs.
If you see them, do not approach.</i>

19:24.563 --> 19:27.692
<i>Call local law enforcement
so that we can apprehend.</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:29.934
Hello, local law enforcement?
We are the...

19:30.169 --> 19:31.330
Zane, what are you doing?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.368
I am programmed to obey the law.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.099
Not telling them our location
would be a direct violation.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.440
Hey, aren't you...

19:38.711 --> 19:40.338
No, no. We're not the Ninja.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.776
We're that other group with a Nindroid,
a ghost, a girl...

19:43.182 --> 19:45.776
Six on six. At least it's an even number.

19:46.052 --> 19:49.750
We're not going to fight them. Right now
it's us who look like the bad guys.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.583
How are we supposed to defend ourselves?
Witty banter?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.190
<i>ZANE". Statistically speaking,</i>

19:54.393 --> 19:56.623
your witty banter
tends to only get us into more trouble.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.456
I liked it better when they were fans.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.695
- Thanks for the help.
-l've got a visual.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.694
There's no time, come on!

20:36.168 --> 20:38.068
There's nowhere to hide.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.535
There may be one place. NINJAAAA-GO!

20:43.876 --> 20:45.469
They're under the floorboards!

20:52.118 --> 20:54.109
Mom, we're in a bit of ajam!

20:54.453 --> 20:56.285
<i>I</i> saw the news and <i>I</i> am en route.

20:56.455 --> 20:58.549
Looks like you've gone
from fame to framed.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.456
<i>LLOYD". And we'll never find out who
did this to us unless we get outta here.</i>

21:03.195 --> 21:04.594
I can hear them over here.

21:05.164 --> 21:09.567
Someone get on those cranes!
Let's find those Ninja!

21:10.770 --> 21:13.603
<i>I</i> think <i>I</i> saw one right below us.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.534
Crane three. Down. Now.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.004
10 feet east. Now!

21:22.782 --> 21:25.149
Did we get them?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.613
Can you see them?

21:31.557 --> 21:32.718
Look!

21:32.992 --> 21:34.983
Ha! Home, sweet home!

21:39.098 --> 21:40.259
Take her down.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.199
Oh, no!

21:48.340 --> 21:50.775
Lower all the cranes and check them out!

21:51.043 --> 21:53.478
Those fruit-colored bozos
could be hiding anywhere.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.004
- We need to split up.
- Split up?

21:56.248 --> 21:57.716
But we're all in this together.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.874
We have a better chance of getting
outta here if we divide.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.111
Nothing ever good comes
when we're split up.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.517
That's when bad things happen!
Chen's Island! Yang's Temple!

22:05.791 --> 22:07.987
Morro's possession! All bad things!

22:08.194 --> 22:12.392
We have no other choice,
we have to go. Now!

22:14.967 --> 22:16.093
This one's empty, sir.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.568
I hate them fruit-colored Ninja!

22:20.806 --> 22:22.240
We didn't catch the Ninja,
Commissioner.

22:22.808 --> 22:26.403
We will, oh, we will.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.072
"Be careful what you wish for."

22:30.516 --> 22:31.506
Hmm...

22:36.422 --> 22:40.757
Did somebody say "wish"?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.366
