WEBVTT

02:26.647 --> 02:27.712
Yes?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.115
Yes, I'm Mark Wilder

02:31.284 --> 02:32.350
Oh, you'll pick us up?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.986
Perfect, thank you.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.124
No, that's not necessary.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.159
Okay, yes, wonderful. Thank you.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.162
See you soon. Thanks. Bye.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.299
While most scientists consider
it superstition,

02:49.269 --> 02:52.219
it's a part of everyday life

02:52.221 --> 02:55.172
according to the experiences of many
people and researchers in certain areas:

02:56.009 --> 02:57.442
contact with the deceased

02:57.811 --> 03:00.311
and the existence of what are
commonly called ghosts.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.215
My guest today is Professor
Lang,

03:04.217 --> 03:07.085
who's spent more than thirty years working
in this field in Freiburg, Germany.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.755
Professor Lang:

03:12.092 --> 03:14.693
what happens immediately after a
person dies?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.161
First:

03:16.163 --> 03:19.230
how can we know anything about
this at all?

03:19.232 --> 03:23.034
Research in this area began
almost 140 years ago.

03:24.071 --> 03:28.073
The Society for Psychical Research in
London has done a great deal of work on it.

03:28.075 --> 03:31.443
And there are many pieces to the
puzzle that can provide answers.

03:32.112 --> 03:36.381
Let's begin with something that
I'm particularly interested in.

03:36.717 --> 03:43.888
In one of your publications you write that individuals who
die suddenly possibly don't realize that they're dead.

03:44.024 --> 03:47.492
As a result, they remain in
their accustomed surroundings.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.763
Could this be the reason why
certain places are called haunted?

03:51.765 --> 03:55.033
If these souls don't receive help
leaving the intermediate world,

03:55.802 --> 04:00.138
their uncertainty can result in them
haunting locations or even individuals.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.774
That's very unpleasant.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.876
Tell me something.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.945
Victor Timmaz once told me

04:07.214 --> 04:10.315
that spirits see someone who's
just passed away

04:10.984 --> 04:12.183
as when they were young,

04:12.819 --> 04:14.819
as a 25 to 35 year old,

04:14.821 --> 04:19.424
even if they were 95 and old and
wrinkled when they passed.

04:20.227 --> 04:23.027
That seems to be the case,
according to accounts from people

04:23.029 --> 04:27.065
who had a near-death experience and saw
deceased relatives on the other side.

04:28.535 --> 04:32.470
Apparently, you're seen as you looked
in the best years of your life.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.293
... which apparently
happens with children.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.564
There's a report from Sweden about a
man who was in a car accident with his family.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.567
Tragically, his
seven-month-old baby was killed,

05:03.170 --> 05:05.036
and the man had a near-death
experience

05:05.205 --> 05:07.872
...before the paramedics
were able to reanimate him.

05:09.342 --> 05:12.210
He was briefly together with his
son on the other side,

05:12.813 --> 05:15.947
who appeared to be approximately
ten years old.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.351
Hey?!

05:20.353 --> 05:21.853
What are you up to?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.823
Reading. Watching videos.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.126
I got you something!

05:28.295 --> 05:29.460
Flowers?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.836
You thought of the battery for
the dustbuster?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.474
For me?

05:44.110 --> 05:46.411
No. For somebody we haven't met
yet.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.427
I'm only nine month long...

06:02.896 --> 06:04.229
I couldn't resist.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.404
You know that our baby will have
the best father in the world?!

06:14.140 --> 06:15.240
Wow!

06:15.242 --> 06:16.307
Who is he?

06:17.978 --> 06:21.546
An incredibly hot and talented
screenwriter.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.833
Yes, yes...

06:25.835 --> 06:28.653
Probably that guy with the great sense of humor
that you met at Rag Trader four years ago.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.088
Yes...

06:30.657 --> 06:31.923
that's him!

06:32.158 --> 06:33.674
Well...

06:33.676 --> 06:35.193
Do you two have some kind of
relationship now?

06:36.162 --> 06:38.328
Believe it or not:

06:38.330 --> 06:40.497
we live together and I see him
nearly every day.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.566
Wow!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.635
We even got married last year!

06:43.637 --> 06:44.903
Really? No?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.338
And for our wedding he gave me a
ring that

06:47.941 --> 06:49.908
still takes my breath away:

06:50.343 --> 06:52.010
two carats!

06:52.145 --> 06:54.212
Wow! He must be crazy about you.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.116
And I love him more than I can
say.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.654
For example, when I see him all
sweaty after jogging,

07:04.557 --> 07:06.624
I just want to do him right
away.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.661
Then maybe he should take a
shower?

07:12.332 --> 07:13.631
He should...

07:20.073 --> 07:21.205
What are you doing?

07:23.510 --> 07:24.943
My chocolate?

07:26.546 --> 07:27.712
Just a second.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.467
Do you still want to take a trip
to Europe?

07:51.738 --> 07:53.204
Are you kidding me?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.340
No.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.543
We'll never be able to take our
trip to Europe.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.811
Why not?

08:00.813 --> 08:03.080
Just because you started your new job
at the Medical Center two years ago?

08:03.450 --> 08:07.352
And last year I had to work on the new TV
series and couldn't take a vacation this year?

08:07.554 --> 08:11.255
And because a baby will turn the life
we've been living upside down next year?

08:11.558 --> 08:16.160
And because we'll have five more kids, have to raise
them and spend all our time, energy and money?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.395
Don't worry about it.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.197
When the last one goes to college,
our first kids will be supporting us

08:20.199 --> 08:23.000
and then we'll be able to take the
kind of trip we've always wanted to.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.068
Sounds great.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.572
I wonder if all the guidebooks that
we've will still be up to date...

08:28.575 --> 08:29.741
...in three decades.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.011
But do you know what:

08:33.013 --> 08:34.112
it doesn't matter.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.415
I'm sure they have special
editions for senior citizens,

08:37.417 --> 08:38.716
and we can just get them.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.687
By then we'll have chips
implanted in our heads

08:42.689 --> 08:46.024
that'll guide us through our vacation
and to all the tourist attractions.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.327
Or make us imagine we're
on a amazing trip

08:49.329 --> 08:52.063
While we lie in a hospital
bed and get fed through a tube.

08:52.565 --> 08:56.067
And they monitor our new hips and
pacemakers and artificial organs.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.185
Better than cigarettes.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.822
Liv, I'm...

09:17.824 --> 09:23.161
I'm not really crazy about the idea of traveling
through Europe without our six kids SOME DAY.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.763
We should make the trip without
them NOW.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.668
What's in that envelope?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.804
Something you're going to like a
lot.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.407
Something a future mommy will
like?

09:39.712 --> 09:41.345
It's a rental agreement for a

09:41.548 --> 09:43.481
1,500 sq ft. Apartment

09:44.350 --> 09:48.453
with 4 bedrooms and a big kitchen and
an industrial-size washing machine,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.489
and it's here, in our quarter!

09:51.691 --> 09:53.157
Okay, then...

09:54.527 --> 09:59.397
it's the one thing I've been
hoping for my whole life:

10:00.400 --> 10:02.433
a date with Leonardo di Cabrio?!

10:02.435 --> 10:07.805
I tried. But Leo told me that he's not interested
in going out with supermodels right now.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.841
Too bad.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.512
It's the tickets for our four
weeks in Europe.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.783
Don't...

10:19.252 --> 10:20.384
don't joke about that.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.385
I am not joking.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.687
We're leaving in twelve days!

10:24.357 --> 10:25.890
Mark, I'm not falling for this.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.659
You couldn't get away, because
of your new season!

10:29.662 --> 10:32.663
And I don't have a single day of
vacation time left this year.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.699
Liv! It's all been settled.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.501
And now look at what's in the
envelope!

10:36.503 --> 10:37.568
Mark!

10:42.308 --> 10:43.875
I spoke with your boss.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.677
You can take four weeks of
unpaid vacation.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.614
Tyler, Steve and Louise will
take care of your shifts.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.315
Please stop.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.483
This isn't funny.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.286
It's all been worked out, even
with my boss.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.623
And before you are too big for us to
go, we're taking our trip!!

11:00.727 --> 11:02.193
You're crazy, right?

11:02.328 --> 11:02.927
No.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.362
I'm not.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.464
This is the perfect time to go:

11:06.933 --> 11:09.534
a tour through Europe in the
pre-Christmas season,

11:09.702 --> 11:12.803
then we can spend Christmas in
Florence and New Year's in Paris!

11:12.805 --> 11:15.206
No, no. We planned to spend
Christmas with your parents,

11:15.208 --> 11:17.275
and the entire family will be
there, right?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.378
And Chris and Jim invited us
over for New Year's Eve

11:20.380 --> 11:22.446
and we said yes a long time ago.

11:24.751 --> 11:27.518
I'm supposed to go shopping with
Rachel on her birthday.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.724
And we go to Wollman Rink

11:33.726 --> 11:35.193
with the Andersons

11:35.495 --> 11:37.562
every December 6...

11:44.671 --> 11:50.841
Dear God, let it be at least a gift certificate
for some lousy wellness weekend in Ohio.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.444
Otherwise, I'll lose it.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.780
And I'm pregnant, remember...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.649
That wouldn't be good for the
baby.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.963
I warned you!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.799
Oh my God!!

12:18.304 --> 12:19.604
I love you!

12:22.642 --> 12:24.375
Wait, let me see.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.911
When do we take off? And where
do we land?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.615
OK. First, we fly from JFK to
Paris.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.317
Europe! I can hardly
believe it.

12:34.787 --> 12:37.021
If someone had told me
three months ago that

12:38.358 --> 12:41.892
I'd see my great-grandparents'
hometown before Christmas,

12:42.962 --> 12:44.695
while I'm pregnant

12:45.632 --> 12:47.431
I'd have said they're
crazy.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.403
Ladies and gentleman,
this is your captain speaking.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.705
Welcome on board of
Oceanic flight 86a

12:54.707 --> 12:56.574
From Paris to Weeze.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.443
Weather looks good and
tailwind is on our side

12:59.445 --> 13:01.345
And we're expecting to
land in the

13:01.347 --> 13:06.550
Lower Rhine area in Germany
5 or 10 minutes ahead of schedule.

13:06.953 --> 13:11.022
So sit back, relax and
enjoy the rest of our short flight.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.791
What?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.793
We're going to have a girl!

13:19.499 --> 13:21.214
We're going to have a girl?

13:21.216 --> 13:22.932
Do you have some special source
of information?

13:23.936 --> 13:26.003
I just feel that it'll be a
girl.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.571
I'm totally certain.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.542
What's favorite name?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.049
Mason.

13:39.852 --> 13:40.851
That's a boy's name.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.369
I know.

13:42.371 --> 13:43.888
But I said it's going to be a
girl.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.023
I don't want to discuss girl's
names right now.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.091
Why not?

13:48.428 --> 13:49.927
Do you remember the Andersons?

13:49.929 --> 13:53.931
Rose was so freaked out by the names
David suggested that he almost left her.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.800
I don't want that to happen.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.536
Yeah, I know. Her hormones were
going crazy.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.973
We women are a little irrational
after getting pregnant.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.575
Right? But...

14:04.577 --> 14:06.977
...I have everything under
control now, no?

14:07.814 --> 14:08.979
I'd better say yes.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.048
You don't think so?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.950
I wouldn't dare contradict you.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.387
Fine. Then tell me your favorite
girl's name!

14:24.397 --> 14:25.496
Whatever you want:

14:28.935 --> 14:30.000
Giselle.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.571
Giselle?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.106
Giselle!

14:35.875 --> 14:36.907
You're not serious!

14:36.909 --> 14:38.676
You see? It's already starting!

14:38.678 --> 14:41.412
You always begin an argument
with "You're not serious!"

14:42.448 --> 14:43.748
But Gisele?! Come on!

14:43.750 --> 14:45.783
There it is: a discussion.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.485
That's just what I didn't want.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.553
And that's why I won't say
anything more.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.158
Yes, but...

14:54.160 --> 14:56.827
...you started it. You can't
just stop now.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.932
That wasn't my real choice.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.634
What do you mean?

15:04.636 --> 15:06.569
Gisele isn't my favorite. I just
wanted to see your reaction.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.873
Oh, I see.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.608
Fine. You know what:

15:10.610 --> 15:12.576
I think Gisele's great.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.478
That's what we'll call our
daughter.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.713
Please, let's drop this.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.949
We have plenty of time, and we'll
end up with your favorite anyway.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.819
You're the mom. You're the boss.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.656
If it's a girl,
I get to choose the name,

15:26.959 --> 15:29.026
and if it's a boy, we'll call
him Mason.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.730
You suggested Mason, and I like
Mason.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.466
Fine, that's what we'll do.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.802
But you have to tell me your
pick.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.672
Yes.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.073
But you might not like it.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.009
That's a possibility.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.616
Frieda.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.754
Frieda?

15:59.725 --> 16:00.791
Yes?!

16:01.961 --> 16:04.228
Your great-grandmother's name,

16:04.230 --> 16:06.664
the one who emigrated from
Germany?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.171
I think it's great.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.489
Really?

16:16.491 --> 16:17.874
Really. I like it a lot. It
could've been my idea.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.511
It could've been my idea.

16:25.885 --> 16:26.951
I love you!

16:27.253 --> 16:29.520
I'm not surprised...

17:14.967 --> 17:17.134
Now I know why it won't be
difficult to pick us out.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.736
There's not a lot happening
here.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.104
Did you describe us?

17:20.106 --> 17:22.172
As two good-looking Americans.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.975
Shouldn't be difficult.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.951
Welcome to Europe!

17:36.789 --> 17:38.022
I'm happy...

18:18.731 --> 18:20.230
Are you Mr. and Ms. Wilder?

18:20.232 --> 18:21.298
Hi, yes.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.000
Oh, how nice.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.902
Welcome to Germany.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.270
Did you have a good flight?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.373
Yeah, it was fine. Thanks,
Ms...?

18:30.176 --> 18:31.642
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:37.216 --> 18:38.349
Elisabeth Thun.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.217
I'm Ms Roth's daughter.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.218
Nice to meet you.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.786
I'm sorry you had to wait.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.121
It's really nice of you to
pick us up.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.473
Yes, it's no problem at all.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.826
I live only 10 minutes from here and have to
go to the house anyway to show you around.

18:48.828 --> 18:52.412
And...

18:52.414 --> 18:55.999
...there's a car-rental company there that's much less
expensive than the ones at the airport. You'll save a lot.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.203
Yeah, but it's still really nice
of you to do that, thank you.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.270
You're welcome.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.772
And you can have the house for
two nights as you booked.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.275
That's right. Is there a
problem?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.277
No, no...

19:09.649 --> 19:12.750
My mother... She had to go to
the hospital yesterday.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.984
She's not in very good shape.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.152
Ah, oh.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.054
Oh my gosh. Mark!

19:17.056 --> 19:23.360
Ms. Thun, if you have other things to deal with,
we can spend the first few nights at a hotel.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.729
No, no, absolutely not.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.798
I talked to my sister, and it's
no problem at all.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.167
Everything's been set up and
paid for.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.170
So please get in, I'll drive you
to the house.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.306
So we can get there before dark.

20:20.352 --> 20:21.852
Here we are.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.959
Welcome! I hope you enjoy your
stay.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.229
We will. Looks amazing.

20:33.165 --> 20:38.001
This is the living room,
which has a wonderful view of the lake.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.005
But as you can see, the lake's
still dry after the hot summer.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.108
Oh, what a shame.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.944
It never happened before.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.014
Okay, let's continue.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.820
There's an old-fashioned
telephone in the hallway that also works.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.124
If you use it, we charge one euro
per minute, but just for foreign calls.

21:00.526 --> 21:05.329
This room has a sofa bed, so
there's room for four, which you won't need.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.197
And this is...

21:07.500 --> 21:10.434
...the children's bedroom. You
won't need that either.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.004
Okay.

21:14.006 --> 21:18.809
This is the bathroom, which has
a shower.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.778
And this is the kitchen.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.846
There's a combo washer dryer in
here.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.816
You'll find everything you need
in the cupboards.

21:26.519 --> 21:30.420
As arranged, we bought some
basics and put them in the fridge.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.655
Great, thanks.

21:32.657 --> 21:34.891
You can go to the supermarket yourselves
tomorrow morning, when you have your car.

21:35.327 --> 21:38.195
And this is the master bedroom.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.199
If you have any questions,
don't hesitate to call any time.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.268
I wrote my number on the message
board.

21:45.504 --> 21:50.340
So, if you'll excuse me now, I have
to go see my mother at the hospital.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.009
Yes, thanks so much for
everything.

21:52.011 --> 21:55.111
Yes, Elisabeth, thanks.

21:55.113 --> 21:58.214
I'll be here at 9:30 to drive
you to the car-rental company.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.284
But we can take a taxi if
you give us the address.

22:00.452 --> 22:03.020
No, no, it's OK, I'll be glad to
take you.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.221
Bye. See you.

22:04.857 --> 22:05.489
Bye. Thanks.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.962
Pooh. Poor woman.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.364
But what a cool house.

22:16.368 --> 22:17.968
Well done, husband.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.838
I'll put the bags in the
bedroom.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.878
Hey, let's go to the lake before
it gets dark.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.179
Yeah, definitely.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.051
Come on.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.622
Wait a second, let me charge my cell
phone, the battery's almost dead.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.290
Okay, I'll go outside.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.058
Okay!

23:23.235 --> 23:24.568
I can't charge my phone.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.753
Why not?

23:26.755 --> 23:28.505
Their outlets are different, I
didn't think about that.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.941
We have to buy an adapter
tomorrow.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.143
What do you think about this:

23:33.145 --> 23:35.646
I bought two adapters before we
left,

23:36.415 --> 23:37.481
they're in my bag.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.082
I'm impressed!

23:39.084 --> 23:43.287
But I did forget to turn off the
alarm clock in our bedroom.

23:43.956 --> 23:47.224
It'll go off and play every
morning between 7 to 7:15.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.492
Oh, really?

23:49.395 --> 23:51.461
We should go back immediately,
right?

23:52.131 --> 23:54.631
It's an option. I'll think about
it.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.033
Yeah.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.041
Mark?

24:04.376 --> 24:05.475
Yes?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.345
Thanks for all this!

25:07.639 --> 25:09.172
Liv?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.141
Yes?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.376
Where are you?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.212
In the living room.
Where are you?

25:15.214 --> 25:17.080
Here in the kitchen.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.216
Okay.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.249
Why did you wipe Elisabeth's
phone number off the board?

27:01.386 --> 27:03.453
I didn't wipe anything off the
board.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.255
You didn't?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.557
What do you mean?

27:07.559 --> 27:09.626
Elisabeth's phone number,
she wrote it on the board in the kitchen.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.728
She did?

27:11.730 --> 27:14.764
Yeah, she said that she did.
Didn't you hear her?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.535
I don't know.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.773
Did you make coffee a little
while ago?

27:24.910 --> 27:27.643
Why do you ask?

27:27.645 --> 27:30.379
You asked whether I wiped away
Elisabeth's number and made coffee.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.716
I've been lying here on the
couch the entire time!

27:32.885 --> 27:36.753
The coffeepot's on the stove,
and it's still lukewarm.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.423
Okay, well,

27:40.425 --> 27:44.043
maybe someone was here this afternoon
to clean up and they made coffee.

27:44.045 --> 27:47.664
And then forgot to rinse out the pot
and the coffee cup, which is still full?

27:50.536 --> 27:52.602
And the bathroom isn't
really clean.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.305
It looks like somebody
bled into the sink.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.574
Not so good.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.777
Mark, it doesn't matter.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.546
This is a nice place,

28:03.548 --> 28:05.582
and we shouldn't make a big deal
about an unwashed coffee cup

28:05.584 --> 28:07.417
or a dirty sink, should we?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.822
Hey, nobody's perfect. I'll
clean it up.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.369
What's wrong?

28:59.805 --> 29:02.772
I don't know. I'm just a little
out of it.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.542
Jetlag.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.011
What time is it, anyway?

29:12.951 --> 29:15.018
It's 6:15.

29:16.021 --> 29:18.722
That's 12:15 pm at home, right?

29:20.392 --> 29:22.459
Did you sleep on the plane?

29:22.728 --> 29:23.793
No.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.562
No, not really.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.730
Neither did I.

29:26.732 --> 29:29.399
That means we missed an entire
night's sleep.

29:30.535 --> 29:31.935
Should we go to bed now?

29:34.006 --> 29:38.775
Let's wait a little while, then we'll
get into the rhythm here quicker.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.978
Let's go to bed at 9, okay?

29:43.815 --> 29:45.448
Let's go in now.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.983
I'm cold.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.035
Should I turn on some music?

30:06.438 --> 30:07.771
If you want to.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.650
Doesn't it work?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.385
No.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.788
Maybe the radio won't connect to
the internet.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.624
Then just forget about it.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.329
I don't mind a little quiet
right now.

30:33.598 --> 30:34.664
Okay.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.041
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.945
I don't even feel like having a
glass of wine or reading.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.514
Wow, that's unusual.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.417
You have to keep me awake
until 9 o'clock.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.353
Do something!

30:56.355 --> 30:57.420
Okay!

30:57.422 --> 31:03.626
I've been wondering if this house had been
built when my great-grandparents lived here.

31:06.498 --> 31:10.867
According to the booking
website, it was built in 1915.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.635
So, yes.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.770
Cool.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.772
Maybe they knew the
owners and even visited here.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.613
I wonder if someone died here?

31:25.016 --> 31:26.750
It's possible.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.787
Then the house might be haunted.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.425
Like by a ghost who'll scare us
a little tonight?

31:41.700 --> 31:44.134
Why are you so interested
in ghost stories?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.673
What do you mean with...

31:50.909 --> 31:52.976
..."interested in ghost
stories"?

31:55.046 --> 31:57.981
Your interest in spiritual
stuff.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.784
You always watch those
videos.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.128
I bet you didn't think I
noticed.

32:15.133 --> 32:19.102
My interest has some to do
with great-grandma Frieda.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.004
Frieda?

32:21.673 --> 32:23.039
That's relevant...

32:24.743 --> 32:26.109
Do you wanna hear it?

32:26.645 --> 32:28.060
What?

32:28.062 --> 32:29.478
A ghost story about my
great-grandma.

32:29.714 --> 32:30.914
Wow!

32:30.916 --> 32:35.985
Have you been saving this for our first
night in your great-grandparents' hometown?

32:35.987 --> 32:36.719
Maybe.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.488
So do you wanna hear it or not?

32:38.657 --> 32:39.856
It's a true story.

32:39.858 --> 32:41.724
That's how most great stories
start:

32:41.860 --> 32:43.927
Based on a true story!

32:44.629 --> 32:46.663
Go on then. Now I'm curious!

32:48.967 --> 32:50.967
My great-grandma was a medium.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.769
A medium? What's that?

32:53.905 --> 32:56.873
It's said that she could
communicate with the dead.

32:57.843 --> 33:02.779
She had a group of people who held seances
with her every Sunday for many years.

33:04.015 --> 33:07.484
That's when she supposedly
talked to spirits.

33:08.019 --> 33:10.086
Uh-huh.

33:11.556 --> 33:14.257
My mother's certain that her
grandma really had this gift.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.092
Don't look at me like that!

33:16.094 --> 33:21.998
After my great-grandfather died suddenly,
some important papers were missing,

33:22.934 --> 33:25.001
birth certificates from Germany
I think,

33:25.837 --> 33:27.904
and no one knew where he put
them.

33:29.908 --> 33:34.577
Then my great-grandma contacted
my great-grandpa one day.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.646
She spoke with your dead
great-grandpa?!

33:37.749 --> 33:39.816
Maybe I do need a drink now.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.055
My dead great-grandpa told my
living great-grandma

33:46.057 --> 33:48.591
that the papers were in a safety
deposit box,

33:48.593 --> 33:50.894
and the key was stuck under his
desk.

33:51.229 --> 33:55.231
My great-grandma looked, and my
grandma and mom were with her.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.033
And the key was there.

33:57.035 --> 34:01.037
And it opened a safety deposit box.
And that's how they found the papers.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.008
Ever since then my mom's convinced
that there's a life after death.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.779
Now I'm not surprised that
you watch these videos.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.049
You don't believe in it at all.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.119
I just can't imagine that it's
true.

34:19.658 --> 34:23.560
When we die, it's like going to
sleep, forever, but without dreams.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.029
Everything's gone. Lights out.

34:26.031 --> 34:30.199
I'm sure your great-grandma heard her
husband mention where the key was.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.703
Then she forgot, and remembered it when
she thought she was communicating with him.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.272
Yes, I know. I've thought about
too.

34:36.274 --> 34:37.807
And maybe that's what happened.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.310
But maybe it's not. There's no
way we can be sure.

34:41.146 --> 34:46.583
For me, there's a big difference between
seeing my patients as just biological machines

34:46.952 --> 34:48.017
Or...

34:48.019 --> 34:53.723
and I know this sounds funny to you, but
I can't think of any other way to put it-

34:54.593 --> 34:56.726
as spiritual beings.

34:56.728 --> 35:01.197
But Liv, if that were true,
that we continue to exist in some form,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.866
just imagine that we exist
forever?

35:05.170 --> 35:06.936
What do you do all the time?

35:06.938 --> 35:11.040
That doesn't make any sense. And that's
the problem with the idea of eternal life.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.779
Maybe what we call time doesn't
exist on the other side.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.222
What was it?

35:27.058 --> 35:28.157
Your great-grandpa?

35:28.760 --> 35:29.892
Your great-grandma?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.160
Both of them?

35:31.997 --> 35:33.196
Very funny.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.832
Seriously, what do you think it
was?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.033
I don't know.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.268
Sounds like a mouse

35:39.804 --> 35:40.802
or a rat.

35:40.804 --> 35:41.803
Here in the floor?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.941
Do you think they can get into
the house?

35:44.943 --> 35:48.778
No, I don't think that mice or rats
can get into the house that easily.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.014
What if they can get into our
bed.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.360
There is something there.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.729
I hate rats!

36:06.731 --> 36:10.833
The house has doors facing the lake,
and I'm sure there's a basement.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.870
It's possible that some animals
are crawling around in it,

36:14.105 --> 36:17.840
maybe not mices or rats, it
could be a vole.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.944
I'll take a look and find out.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.146
That's great.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.214
That's what you're here for.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.750
To protect me from wild animals.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.219
Than I'll do my duty and take a
look.

38:10.355 --> 38:11.554
Liv?

38:21.232 --> 38:22.331
Liv?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.368
Hello? Can you hear me?

38:29.541 --> 38:31.908
Are you trying to play a joke on
me?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.043
What do you mean?

38:34.045 --> 38:36.179
Why are you acting like you
can't see me?

38:36.181 --> 38:37.947
I didn't see you.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.081
Where were you?

38:39.584 --> 38:40.917
Right here?!

38:40.919 --> 38:42.418
But not a few seconds ago?!

38:42.420 --> 38:44.186
Yes I was.

38:44.188 --> 38:45.955
I thought you were
making some kind of bad joke.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.024
I didn't see you.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.060
It must be jet lag.

38:52.497 --> 38:55.097
Did you find anything out about
our housemates?

38:55.099 --> 38:57.233
There is a cavity under the
living room floor.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.002
I'm sure there is some mice in
there, but I didn't see any.

39:00.004 --> 39:04.607
If you can't see me when I'm standing right in front
of you, the basement's probably full of rodents.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.476
I just hope they don't come up
to visit us.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.515
Was Elisabeth's number there?

39:14.352 --> 39:15.484
Yes.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.889
So who wiped it away?

39:20.625 --> 39:22.892
That's what I already asked you.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.064
But I didn't do it.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.532
I didn't either.

39:39.277 --> 39:40.576
What was that?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.087
Someone is walking around up
there.

39:52.323 --> 39:55.424
No, the attic is just creaking,
this is an old house.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.297
That doesn't sound like a creaky
attic.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.433
Mark?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.641
Mark?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.179
There's nothing in the rooms.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.381
But look,

41:58.383 --> 42:01.517
there seems to be an attic over
them on both sides.

42:03.388 --> 42:05.454
But I don't know how to get to
it.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.326
There's a small door outside on
the gable.

42:10.795 --> 42:13.062
I saw it when we came in.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.597
Where?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.600
It's right above the kitchen
door.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.452
No one could be in there, right?

42:39.057 --> 42:40.489
Is somebody up there?

42:40.725 --> 42:42.425
If there is: please be quiet,

42:42.560 --> 42:45.911
we want to get some sleep.

42:45.913 --> 42:49.265
This is getting crazy. Is this some kind of
spook house and you didn't tell me about it?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.100
Wish it were...

42:51.102 --> 42:53.702
You do? Are you afraid?

42:54.305 --> 42:56.639
I'd rather you said you aren't,
because I'm pretty scared.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.175
No, no, no. It's nothing.

43:02.814 --> 43:07.149
Let's take our phones into the
bedroom and lock the door.

43:07.151 --> 43:09.218
Otherwise I won't be able to get
any sleep.

43:26.637 --> 43:28.404
Did you move my phone?

43:28.673 --> 43:30.106
No!

43:32.410 --> 43:35.811
I put it here on the cabinet,
along with the charger cord.

43:36.881 --> 43:39.148
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

43:39.784 --> 43:43.285
Come on, let's go to bed. I don't
care what time it is, I'm dead tired.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.722
What do you mean, it's here somewhere?
I'd like to know where my phone is.

43:46.858 --> 43:48.491
Let's look in the bedroom.

43:53.498 --> 43:54.663
What's wrong?

43:54.665 --> 43:55.798
My phone?!

43:56.234 --> 43:57.500
What about your phone??

43:57.502 --> 43:58.601
It's not in any of my pockets.

43:58.603 --> 43:59.735
I must have lost it.

43:59.737 --> 44:01.237
Are you making fun of me?

44:01.239 --> 44:03.305
No, I'm not joking. It's really
gone.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.610
Maybe it fell out when you were
in the basement?

44:09.180 --> 44:10.546
That's possible.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.755
My phone isn't outside
either.

45:27.592 --> 45:29.658
Did you really have to make a
mess here?

45:33.264 --> 45:34.663
I didn't do that!

45:35.700 --> 45:37.433
Oh, you didn't? Sure...

45:37.435 --> 45:38.667
No, it wasn't me!

45:45.776 --> 45:46.909
Mark?!

45:46.911 --> 45:51.981
I turned the radio on a while ago, and it seems
to have finally connected with the internet.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.484
Okay, then you can please turn
it off?

45:56.320 --> 45:57.453
Sure...

46:17.275 --> 46:18.340
Mark?

46:25.750 --> 46:26.815
Mark?!

46:28.452 --> 46:29.685
Liv??

46:33.591 --> 46:34.723
How did you get there?

46:34.725 --> 46:35.791
What do you mean?

46:36.494 --> 46:38.060
Why are you there and not here?

46:38.396 --> 46:41.463
Because I turned the radio off
and came back here?

46:41.632 --> 46:42.798
No, you didn't!

46:42.800 --> 46:43.966
I didn't?

46:44.335 --> 46:46.902
No, you weren't there just a
second ago.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.971
That's right, I was in the
living room.

46:49.740 --> 46:50.806
Yes, but...

46:51.642 --> 46:53.042
you didn't come back.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.977
Of course I did, but you weren't
here anymore.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.300
How is that possible?

47:02.302 --> 47:04.085
We would've run into each other, right?
The house isn't that big.

47:04.088 --> 47:06.355
But I'm here now. That's
obvious, isn't it?

47:06.357 --> 47:12.061
Can you tell me why our bags have been ransacked
and things have been strewn around the bedroom?

47:12.063 --> 47:14.897
No!! And I didn't do anything to
our baggage.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.965
I thought that you put some
stuff in the wardrobe.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.401
No, I didn't go near the bags.

47:20.004 --> 47:22.104
And I wouldn't have left
everything like that.

47:22.106 --> 47:25.073
That's your specialty, making a
mess of everything.

47:25.075 --> 47:28.043
OK, so it was me who wiped off Elisabeth's
number and messed up our luggage, right?

47:28.045 --> 47:29.778
No. It wasn't you. Of course
not.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.846
No.

47:30.848 --> 47:33.949
That's strange, because it
wasn't me either.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.852
So there is only one answer:

47:37.922 --> 47:39.988
it's all part of some kind of
game.

47:40.391 --> 47:43.859
YOU booked this house, and now
there are these weird noises,

47:43.861 --> 47:47.363
our phones disappear and our
luggage is rummaged through.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.431
It's supposed to be like a
haunted house,

47:49.433 --> 47:51.500
which is probably the way YOU
arranged it.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.469
To be honest:

47:53.804 --> 47:55.938
I was thinking along the same
lines.

47:55.940 --> 47:59.074
That you're putting this on as
some kind of creep show.

47:59.076 --> 48:03.679
It wasn't a coincidence you told me that
story about your great-grandpa and grandma.

48:03.681 --> 48:06.415
And now the number
disappearing off the board.

48:06.984 --> 48:09.051
Oh, right. You can't fool me.

48:09.653 --> 48:12.588
It would be nice if you got the
phones so that we can charge them.

48:12.590 --> 48:17.493
I'd like to call my parents and send a few texts
telling people that we've arrived safely.

48:17.828 --> 48:19.461
I don't have the phones.

48:19.930 --> 48:21.663
This is getting old.

48:26.771 --> 48:29.405
Can we shut this game
down?

48:30.107 --> 48:34.843
I'm dead tired and would like to charge our
phones, send some texts home and then go to bed.

48:34.845 --> 48:36.912
You're really going all out with
this.

48:39.650 --> 48:40.749
Mark!!

48:41.085 --> 48:42.818
to be honest: I'm tired, too.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.854
I'd like to get some sleep,
and that's why I'm begging you,

48:45.856 --> 48:49.858
please get our phones and put
everything back into the bags.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.661
I really don't have any more
patience for this.

48:52.863 --> 48:53.929
Right!

48:55.199 --> 48:57.466
Okay, what are we waiting for?

48:58.202 --> 49:01.770
Is there going to be a ghost
or a serial killer or something?

49:02.173 --> 49:04.440
Or are there hidden cameras?

49:04.608 --> 49:06.909
It's all hilarious, but it's
getting old,

49:06.911 --> 49:08.177
and I'm starting to get pissed.

49:08.179 --> 49:10.595
Liv!!

49:10.597 --> 49:13.014
this is the truth: all this
isn't my doing.

49:13.684 --> 49:18.887
I didn't hide our phones or mess
up our luggage or make noises.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.623
This house isn't part of an
amusement park,

49:21.625 --> 49:23.692
and I have no idea what's going
on here.

49:24.161 --> 49:25.828
Maybe you can tell me?!

49:29.033 --> 49:30.599
It really wasn't you, was it?

49:30.601 --> 49:31.667
No!

49:33.904 --> 49:35.471
It wasn't me either...

49:45.649 --> 49:46.982
Someone else is here...

49:51.889 --> 49:53.021
What is it?

49:54.558 --> 49:55.858
Did you hear something?

50:04.768 --> 50:06.168
Mark?

50:27.057 --> 50:28.257
What is it?

51:02.159 --> 51:03.659
Who is that?

51:04.161 --> 51:05.327
I've no idea...

51:09.633 --> 51:10.866
Who are you?

51:13.804 --> 51:15.170
Do you understand me?

51:30.321 --> 51:32.588
Why is there a little girl in
the house?

51:37.361 --> 51:39.127
What do yo want to do?

51:40.264 --> 51:43.332
We should probably call
somebody.

51:44.902 --> 51:46.668
Yes, call Elisabeth.

51:46.670 --> 51:48.937
Good idea, but her number's been
wiped off the board.

51:52.142 --> 51:54.209
Check the trip information!

51:54.712 --> 51:57.145
It's in the cloud.
And I can't get to it without my phone.

51:57.381 --> 51:59.348
Then look for our phones
in the children's bedroom.

51:59.350 --> 52:01.783
Do you really think that the
little girl has our phones?

52:01.952 --> 52:03.018
Who else?

52:03.020 --> 52:04.152
I don't know.

52:05.155 --> 52:07.823
She's probably just
totally scared.

52:10.027 --> 52:12.394
Then use the landline and call
the police.

52:16.667 --> 52:17.799
Come on!

52:18.202 --> 52:20.268
What number should I dial? 911?

52:20.404 --> 52:21.637
I don't know.

52:21.639 --> 52:22.704
I'll try it.

52:29.046 --> 52:30.178
No...

52:30.180 --> 52:32.247
I'll check the guidebook.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.245
It's 110 for the police.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.758
Helio! Do you speak English?

53:17.928 --> 53:19.995
My name is Mark Wilder. Do you
speak English?

53:22.132 --> 53:24.433
Hello, can you... Hello? Hello?

53:27.104 --> 53:29.404
He hung up. I don't
think he could hear me.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.440
That's not possible. Let me try.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.051
Do you speak English?

53:44.254 --> 53:45.954
Hello, can you hear me?

53:47.725 --> 53:48.857
Hello?

53:51.495 --> 53:52.761
He hung up.

53:53.397 --> 53:54.996
They can't hear us.

53:55.265 --> 53:56.732
I'll call Jack!!

54:32.136 --> 54:34.719
Hello!?

54:34.721 --> 54:37.305
Jack? Oh, hi, it's me,
Mark. Can you hear me?

54:37.808 --> 54:38.406
Hello??

54:38.408 --> 54:40.041
Jack, can you hear me?

54:40.410 --> 54:41.543
Who is this?

54:41.545 --> 54:43.345
It's me, Mark! Can you hear me??

54:43.347 --> 54:45.413
If you hear me, I can't hear
anything.

54:46.083 --> 54:47.415
If it's you, Charlotte:

54:47.417 --> 54:48.850
Stop playing games!

54:48.852 --> 54:50.919
Jack?? Jack!!

54:53.457 --> 54:55.824
It's not working. No one can
hear us.

54:57.828 --> 54:58.927
Fuck.

54:59.062 --> 55:00.529
This is so messed up.

55:00.898 --> 55:02.197
What now?

55:03.333 --> 55:05.834
I'll find out if the
girl has our phones.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.847
Do you have our phones?

55:23.020 --> 55:24.452
Okay, you can't understand me.

55:25.989 --> 55:28.056
I'll just take a look around
your room.

56:11.068 --> 56:12.367
They're not here.

56:18.108 --> 56:21.877
I'll go outside to the road.
Someone'll drive by sooner or later.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.511
What do you mean?

56:23.513 --> 56:27.649
I'll go to the road and stop a
car or find the nearest house.

56:27.651 --> 56:30.118
No, I don't want to stay here alone.
Without a phone, without you.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.254
Liv: There's a little girl in
the house,

56:32.256 --> 56:33.989
and we don't know who she is.

56:34.124 --> 56:36.491
We have to contact someone, and
we can't just leave her here.

56:36.493 --> 56:39.661
I'll find someone to call the police
and you stay here in the meantime.

56:39.997 --> 56:42.130
What should I do about the girl?

56:42.132 --> 56:44.566
She's in the bedroom.
Leave her there, I'll be back soon.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.202
You're not serious, are you? Of course
I'll leave her there. I'm going with you.

56:47.204 --> 56:51.973
OK. Liv, please. You have to stay here.
We can't leave the girl alone.

56:51.975 --> 56:57.078
Just think: while we're getting the police, she goes
outside and falls in the lake or something else happens.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.914
Then we'll have a real problem!!

58:56.800 --> 58:59.067
Where are our phones?

59:00.604 --> 59:02.070
Where's my watch?

59:03.140 --> 59:04.406
And where's my ring?

59:07.544 --> 59:10.412
My ring? Do you understand? This
isn't funny!!

59:31.101 --> 59:33.501
If these souls
don't receive help,

59:33.503 --> 59:35.203
Leaving the
intermediate world,

59:35.205 --> 59:37.272
Their
uncertainty can result on

59:37.274 --> 59:39.541
Haunting
locations or even indivduals.

59:39.543 --> 59:42.410
...was briefly
together with his sun on the other side

59:42.412 --> 59:45.313
Who appeared to
be approximately 10 years old...

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:06.201
Isn't there anybody in this damn
country? Come on!!

1:00:13.376 --> 1:00:15.443
Hey! Please stop!!

1:00:25.889 --> 1:00:27.489
Do you speak English?

1:00:28.592 --> 1:00:29.858
Yes, of course!

1:00:30.427 --> 1:00:31.726
Great!

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:34.762
Can you call the police for me?

1:00:35.432 --> 1:00:38.266
Call the police? Are you
serious?

1:00:39.769 --> 1:00:41.336
Do you have a cell phone?

1:00:42.873 --> 1:00:45.540
Then can you drive me to
the police? I need help.

1:00:47.444 --> 1:00:48.776
You must be joking.

1:00:48.778 --> 1:00:49.544
No!

1:00:49.546 --> 1:00:53.531
My wife and I are staying at a
house nearby. We're on vacation.

1:00:53.533 --> 1:00:57.519
And a little girl just showed up at the house.
I need to talk to the police, and her parents.

1:00:57.654 --> 1:00:58.853
I understand.

1:00:59.389 --> 1:01:00.488
Get in.

1:01:00.690 --> 1:01:02.590
Thanks. Thank you so much.

1:01:14.771 --> 1:01:16.220
Do you know where they are?

1:01:16.222 --> 1:01:17.672
Yes, more or less. And I have
the houses address.

1:01:35.225 --> 1:01:36.758
Why are you driving with the top
down?

1:01:36.927 --> 1:01:38.259
Because I like it.

1:01:39.262 --> 1:01:40.628
Is the top broken?

1:01:40.630 --> 1:01:41.896
No, I just put it down.

1:01:41.898 --> 1:01:43.665
I prefer driving this way.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:56.744
Is it far to the police station?

1:01:56.746 --> 1:02:01.216
We aren't going there. We're going
to check on your wife and the girl.

1:02:01.218 --> 1:02:04.068
No, please, I have to talk to
the police!

1:02:04.070 --> 1:02:06.921
Listen, I'm sure that the girl's parents are
really worried and somehow we have to tell them...

1:02:06.923 --> 1:02:08.990
This is the house, isn't it?

1:02:10.794 --> 1:02:13.828
Fine, then we'll check on them
and then go to the police, OK?

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:21.302
Liv? I'm back!

1:02:29.346 --> 1:02:30.411
Liv?

1:02:38.021 --> 1:02:39.287
Liv??

1:02:40.023 --> 1:02:41.289
Where are you?

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:46.327
Liv??

1:03:08.785 --> 1:03:09.917
Aren't they here?

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:15.290
I'm sure they went for help.

1:03:19.029 --> 1:03:20.328
Through that fog?

1:03:21.598 --> 1:03:22.664
Where to?

1:03:24.601 --> 1:03:26.668
Maybe someone picked them up!

1:03:27.470 --> 1:03:28.536
Picked them up??

1:03:29.005 --> 1:03:30.305
Yes, picked them up.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:31.372
What do you mean?

1:03:31.741 --> 1:03:32.807
Well,

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:35.677
maybe someone picked up your
wife and the girl.

1:03:36.513 --> 1:03:37.578
Someone??

1:03:37.781 --> 1:03:38.946
Who would've picked them up?

1:03:39.382 --> 1:03:40.481
What do you mean?

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:42.717
I don't know.

1:03:46.356 --> 1:03:48.423
Can you please take me to the
police now?!

1:03:48.858 --> 1:03:50.091
That might be difficult.

1:03:50.593 --> 1:03:52.727
But I'm sure that everything's
OK.

1:03:52.729 --> 1:03:54.796
Otherwise, your wife would still
be here.

1:03:54.931 --> 1:03:56.397
You think everything's OK?

1:03:56.399 --> 1:03:59.767
If everything were OK, my wife
would be HERE and NOT GONE.

1:03:59.769 --> 1:04:01.836
And there wouldn't be a strange
girl in the house.

1:04:02.405 --> 1:04:04.906
I don't think that there was a
strange girl here.

1:04:05.108 --> 1:04:06.641
Do you think I'm lying??

1:04:09.012 --> 1:04:10.111
Oh dear...

1:04:11.081 --> 1:04:12.547
I have to go...

1:04:13.950 --> 1:04:16.017
Hey, wait! You apparently know
something.

1:04:16.353 --> 1:04:17.719
What's going on here?

1:04:59.662 --> 1:05:00.728
Liv??!!

1:05:00.730 --> 1:05:01.896
Olivia!!!!!

1:05:29.626 --> 1:05:30.691
Liv?

1:05:38.568 --> 1:05:39.634
Liv?

1:05:55.018 --> 1:05:56.083
Liv?

1:05:56.986 --> 1:05:58.052
Liv?

1:06:13.803 --> 1:06:15.570
Mark!? Where are you?

1:06:15.805 --> 1:06:16.871
Liv!!

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:50.104
We're going to have a
baby...

1:06:50.106 --> 1:06:51.939
I'm only nine weeks
long...

1:06:51.941 --> 1:06:54.008
It'll be a part of you and
a part of me...

1:06:54.143 --> 1:06:57.144
Having a baby will mean a
big change in our lives, won't it?

1:06:58.815 --> 1:07:00.882
Oh my god...

1:07:02.652 --> 1:07:04.118
I love you!

1:07:05.755 --> 1:07:06.821
Mark?!

1:07:12.061 --> 1:07:13.127
Mark??

1:07:21.137 --> 1:07:23.204
Did you really have to
make a mess here?

1:08:20.730 --> 1:08:26.834
"Hermann and Gerlinde Roth,
with daughter Gerda. July 18th, 1963."

1:09:21.224 --> 1:09:23.290
Hello? Can you hear me?

1:09:23.893 --> 1:09:25.642
Hello Mark!

1:09:25.644 --> 1:09:27.394
Of course I can. Now we
can talk some more.

1:09:28.798 --> 1:09:29.430
Hello?

1:09:29.432 --> 1:09:31.181
Who are you?

1:09:31.183 --> 1:09:32.933
The woman who just gave
you a ride in her car.

1:09:36.939 --> 1:09:38.305
Did you contact the police?

1:09:38.307 --> 1:09:39.940
No, that's not necessary.

1:09:39.942 --> 1:09:42.043
I can help you find your
wife and the girl.

1:09:42.045 --> 1:09:43.110
Who are you?

1:09:43.279 --> 1:09:44.812
I'm Gerda Roth.

1:09:46.349 --> 1:09:47.815
You're the owners second
daughter,

1:09:47.817 --> 1:09:49.332
Elisabeth is your sister,
right!?

1:09:49.334 --> 1:09:50.850
Elisabeth isn't my
sister, she's my daughter...

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:52.887
Your daughter?

1:09:53.790 --> 1:09:55.122
Is that some kind of joke?

1:09:55.992 --> 1:09:57.425
What are you trying to do,
anyway?

1:09:57.927 --> 1:10:00.010
Just say it:

1:10:00.012 --> 1:10:02.096
what do you want from us? Money?
How much?

1:10:02.098 --> 1:10:03.164
Money?

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:08.518
You think I want money?

1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:11.004
No, definitely not. But I can
help you get out of this situation.

1:10:11.007 --> 1:10:15.209
If that were true, you would've gone
to the police like I asked you to.

1:10:22.852 --> 1:10:25.986
Listen, I really want to help you.
But you have to trust me.

1:10:26.155 --> 1:10:29.724
And I have to help you very carefully,
so that you do not get shocked.

1:10:29.992 --> 1:10:31.792
Just tell me what you want.

1:10:31.794 --> 1:10:36.030
I don't want anything. Just tell me what
you did right after arriving at the house.

1:10:36.032 --> 1:10:37.298
Why do you want to know?

1:10:41.437 --> 1:10:42.203
Hey!!

1:10:42.205 --> 1:10:43.471
Just tell me!

1:10:43.473 --> 1:10:47.341
The quicker you do, the
sooner you'll see your wife.

1:10:55.785 --> 1:10:56.917
Tell me!

1:11:04.961 --> 1:11:08.829
Elisabeth showed us the house,
which I am sure you know...

1:11:08.831 --> 1:11:10.898
There is two dead bodies in your
rowboat.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.835
You have seen two dead bodies in
the rowboat?

1:11:17.073 --> 1:11:18.272
Who is it?

1:11:19.175 --> 1:11:20.307
I don't know...

1:11:21.077 --> 1:11:22.143
You don't know?

1:11:22.145 --> 1:11:23.878
They are under a blanket, so I
couldn't...

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:24.945
Listen:

1:11:24.947 --> 1:11:28.198
if you want to see your wife
again soon,

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:31.452
Tell me precisely everything that happened
and what you did, when you both arrived.

1:11:33.289 --> 1:11:34.822
Think of your wife!

1:11:44.333 --> 1:11:46.400
Elisabeth showed us everything,

1:11:48.437 --> 1:11:49.870
then we said goodbye

1:11:51.841 --> 1:11:54.475
and my wife and I walked to the
dock.

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:58.345
We sat down and talked.

1:11:58.915 --> 1:12:00.981
And? What happened then?

1:12:07.824 --> 1:12:09.056
There was a man...

1:12:10.526 --> 1:12:12.593
He was walking along the lake
bed.

1:12:14.297 --> 1:12:15.896
He came over to us.

1:12:18.868 --> 1:12:20.134
We talked with him.

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.039
Then Olivia and I went into the
house...

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:26.106
Wait.

1:12:26.309 --> 1:12:27.508
The man:

1:12:28.277 --> 1:12:30.344
Exactly what did he do?

1:12:31.147 --> 1:12:32.246
Think!

1:12:37.019 --> 1:12:38.319
I can't remember...

1:12:38.321 --> 1:12:40.888
It was somebody looking for
company, I guess. Nothing more.

1:12:40.890 --> 1:12:42.223
When did he leave?

1:12:47.496 --> 1:12:48.863
You don't know?

1:12:49.432 --> 1:12:50.865
Is it important?

1:12:50.867 --> 1:12:52.366
It IS important!!

1:12:55.037 --> 1:12:56.437
Tell me...

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:02.042
Let me think.

1:13:02.044 --> 1:13:04.111
I still have jet lag.

1:13:07.149 --> 1:13:09.216
I'm sure he left, but what else?

1:13:10.653 --> 1:13:12.920
For some reason I can't remember
clearly.

1:13:13.389 --> 1:13:15.656
Your memories are like a dream,
aren't they?

1:13:18.494 --> 1:13:22.496
What if everything that seems
like an illusion really happened?

1:13:23.132 --> 1:13:27.001
And things that seems to happen
are only like an illusion?

1:13:29.338 --> 1:13:31.405
What did the man do?

1:13:33.676 --> 1:13:36.343
Did you really see him
leave?

1:15:19.582 --> 1:15:20.681
Mr. Wilder?

1:15:22.151 --> 1:15:23.350
Ms. Wilder?

1:15:54.483 --> 1:15:55.816
I can't charge my phone.

1:15:56.252 --> 1:15:58.001
Why not?

1:15:58.003 --> 1:15:59.753
Their outlets are different, I
didn't think about that.

1:16:00.122 --> 1:16:02.189
We have to buy an adapter
tomorrow.

1:16:03.125 --> 1:16:04.391
What do you think about this:

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:07.094
I bought two adapters before we
left,

1:16:07.663 --> 1:16:08.695
they're in my bag.

1:16:08.697 --> 1:16:10.297
I'm impressed!

1:16:10.299 --> 1:16:14.501
But I did forget to turn off the
alarm clock in our bedroom.

1:16:15.171 --> 1:16:18.439
It'll go off and play every
morning between 7 to 7:15.

1:16:18.441 --> 1:16:19.706
Oh, really?

1:16:20.643 --> 1:16:22.709
We should go back immediately,
right?

1:16:23.345 --> 1:16:25.846
It's an option. I'll think about
it.

1:16:26.182 --> 1:16:27.247
Yeah.

1:16:34.290 --> 1:16:35.355
Mark?

1:16:35.791 --> 1:16:36.857
Yes?

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:39.593
Thanks for all this!

1:17:01.851 --> 1:17:03.317
What's he doing?

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.687
Oh, I don't feel like
talking to him.

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:09.856
I'll take a shower...

1:17:09.858 --> 1:17:11.858
You'd like that. You're
staying right here.

1:17:12.394 --> 1:17:13.460
Hallo?

1:17:15.498 --> 1:17:16.897
Ich komme zu Ihnen!

1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:19.566
Sorry, but we only speak
English.

1:17:20.169 --> 1:17:21.535
Ah, okay!

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:24.338
I said that I'm coming to you.

1:17:24.340 --> 1:17:25.439
Are you from England?

1:17:26.142 --> 1:17:28.475
Are you on vacation here?

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:30.811
Yeah, we just arrived for a vacation.
But we're Americans.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:32.546
Americans!

1:17:32.548 --> 1:17:33.614
Yes!

1:17:33.749 --> 1:17:35.315
Now that you mention it.

1:17:35.851 --> 1:17:37.918
I can hear it from your accent.

1:17:39.288 --> 1:17:41.355
Real Americans, great.

1:17:42.725 --> 1:17:45.325
I'm just going to have something
to eat.

1:17:45.461 --> 1:17:48.662
Oh, no. That doesn't work for us right now.
Like I said, we just arrived...

1:17:48.931 --> 1:17:51.198
It's really not a good time.

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:52.900
Don't worry!

1:17:53.269 --> 1:17:55.335
I won't bother you for very
long.

1:17:59.308 --> 1:18:00.707
I just want to have...

1:18:02.378 --> 1:18:03.644
...a little snack.

1:18:05.281 --> 1:18:08.315
Having an empty stomach makes me
a little sick.

1:18:09.418 --> 1:18:12.352
And when do we have Americans
here,

1:18:12.888 --> 1:18:14.588
real Americans?

1:18:16.725 --> 1:18:20.761
This area was occupied by the
British after the war.

1:18:21.664 --> 1:18:25.399
I'm familiar with England and spent
some time there when I was younger.

1:18:26.869 --> 1:18:30.237
The English are a little strange
about food.

1:18:31.774 --> 1:18:34.675
Fish and chips, disgusting.

1:18:34.944 --> 1:18:38.679
And the bars close early,
most of them before midnight.

1:18:38.681 --> 1:18:39.780
Can you imagine that?

1:18:39.782 --> 1:18:44.484
You have to go to a restaurant if
you want to have another drink.

1:18:45.654 --> 1:18:46.720
It's silly...

1:18:51.594 --> 1:18:52.625
Isn't it?

1:18:52.627 --> 1:18:53.659
Can you tell me something
about America?

1:18:58.701 --> 1:19:00.234
You're so quiet.

1:19:00.936 --> 1:19:03.770
Are all Americans quiet?

1:19:05.507 --> 1:19:07.374
The English tend to be loud.

1:19:07.810 --> 1:19:10.277
No, we just don't want to
bother you while you're eating.

1:19:12.781 --> 1:19:16.817
You're not allowed to drink alcohol
on the street in America, right?

1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:21.855
And you have a problem
with naked women on TV,

1:19:23.559 --> 1:19:24.791
isn't that a fact?!

1:19:25.894 --> 1:19:28.795
Even a nipple turns into a
scandal.

1:19:29.431 --> 1:19:30.964
That's not normal.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:34.501
And what about the climate
change?

1:19:36.405 --> 1:19:39.840
Americans don't think it's
happening, do they?!

1:19:40.042 --> 1:19:46.546
But look at this lake. Almost dried out. It
hasn't rained all summer. Climate change.

1:19:48.417 --> 1:19:49.683
They say...

1:19:50.552 --> 1:19:52.619
...that Americans are prudes.

1:19:53.522 --> 1:19:54.821
Are you two prudes?

1:19:54.823 --> 1:19:56.122
Listen, we...

1:19:56.124 --> 1:19:57.424
Listen?? You want me to listen?

1:19:57.426 --> 1:19:58.625
To what?

1:19:58.894 --> 1:20:00.861
To the American point of view?

1:20:00.863 --> 1:20:04.631
No nipples on TV, you can only
drink alcohol indoors,

1:20:04.633 --> 1:20:08.335
but everybody can have a gun to
kill people in a school.

1:20:08.337 --> 1:20:10.604
Is this the American point
of view?

1:20:10.606 --> 1:20:11.738
Is it?

1:20:14.076 --> 1:20:15.676
What's your name?

1:20:18.547 --> 1:20:19.646
Olivia.

1:20:20.516 --> 1:20:21.581
Olivia!?

1:20:22.918 --> 1:20:24.584
That's a beautiful name.

1:20:25.454 --> 1:20:29.022
My name's Walter, which isn't
really pretty.

1:20:29.525 --> 1:20:31.658
Could I trouble you for a cup of
coffee?

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:32.459
Coffee??

1:20:32.461 --> 1:20:34.544
Please!

1:20:34.546 --> 1:20:36.630
That would be nice.
I haven't had any coffee for a long time.

1:20:38.634 --> 1:20:40.701
Let's get him coffee and then
he'd leave...

1:20:45.107 --> 1:20:49.776
I didn't want to be impolite.
I'm really interested in America.

1:20:50.612 --> 1:20:52.979
I apologize if I seemed a little
abrupt.

1:20:52.981 --> 1:20:55.048
It wasn't my intention.

1:20:55.050 --> 1:20:56.350
So.

1:20:56.352 --> 1:20:57.918
Can I have some coffee?

1:21:00.389 --> 1:21:01.521
Of course...

1:21:04.526 --> 1:21:06.593
Black. And no sugar,
please.

1:21:07.896 --> 1:21:09.029
By the way:

1:21:09.531 --> 1:21:11.598
You have a pretty ring.

1:21:17.373 --> 1:21:19.439
You've a very nice wife.

1:21:26.782 --> 1:21:29.950
We Germans have a lot to thank
you Americans for.

1:21:30.085 --> 1:21:31.385
Yes?

1:22:23.038 --> 1:22:30.644
Liberation from the Nazis. And then the reconstruction
and the CARE packages, which were a great help.

1:22:31.513 --> 1:22:33.580
I think that we were happy to do
it.

1:22:34.583 --> 1:22:36.650
A lot of Americans have German
roots.

1:22:36.985 --> 1:22:38.118
Most of us.

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.820
Yes, I suppose that's true.

1:22:40.155 --> 1:22:44.491
And then we Germans mostly
helped each other, right?

1:22:45.961 --> 1:22:48.028
Do you have German roots?

1:22:48.764 --> 1:22:49.930
No.

1:22:49.932 --> 1:22:51.665
What a shame...

1:22:56.071 --> 1:22:57.137
Hello?

1:22:57.139 --> 1:22:58.071
Ms. Thun?

1:22:58.073 --> 1:22:59.673
This is Olivia Wilder.

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:02.542
Is there a problem?

1:23:02.544 --> 1:23:05.212
I just got to my sister's apartment,
and we want to go see our mother in the hospital.

1:23:05.214 --> 1:23:07.080
Can I call back in a
few minutes?

1:23:07.549 --> 1:23:10.584
No, that's OK. I'm sorry.

1:23:11.019 --> 1:23:13.553
We'll be fine. We can talk about
it tomorrow.

1:23:13.555 --> 1:23:14.654
Really?

1:23:15.057 --> 1:23:18.058
Yes, of course. Thanks.

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.126
And all the best for your
mother.

1:23:20.562 --> 1:23:22.629
Thanks. See you
tomorrow morning!

1:23:23.899 --> 1:23:24.965
Yes...

1:24:01.270 --> 1:24:02.536
Mark?

1:24:20.222 --> 1:24:21.288
Mark??

1:24:50.252 --> 1:24:52.319
Mark?! Where are you?
