00:04.304 --> 00:06.505
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:09.475
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:12.745
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.613 --> 00:16.382
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.217
To save herself and her people,

00:18.219 --> 00:21.453
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.123
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:26.025
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.793
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.262
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:32.365 --> 00:34.033
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:34.035 --> 00:36.201
That's diane de poitiers,
the king's mistress.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.337
Then that must be sebastian,
the king's bastard.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.239
Bash:
<i>It's olivia d'amencourt.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:42.174
<i>She left a few months</i>
<i>before you arrived.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:44.676
Brokenhearted?
Yes, he was.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.112
When it is right for France,
I will be by your side.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.414
Until then, you can
spend your time

00:48.416 --> 00:50.349
With others but
not my brother.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.451
Catherine:
<i>He'd known her first.</i>

00:52.453 --> 00:54.420
She was there
in his heart all along.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.487
We're not safe here.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.222
There are people
who matter more

00:57.224 --> 00:59.258
And people who matter less.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.226
I'll make sure
you're remembered.

01:01.228 --> 01:05.497
(trumpet playing)

01:05.499 --> 01:07.833
I don't see bash.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.169
Isn't it the custom
for every able-bodied man

01:10.171 --> 01:11.270
To ride to war
with the king?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.404
Oh, it's not war.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.807
Just a minor
display of temper

01:14.809 --> 01:16.241
By some peasants.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.643
Our sebastian's probably out

01:17.645 --> 01:19.311
Riding at the front
with the king.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.814
Men must find something
to kill from time to time.

01:21.816 --> 01:22.815
It's a pity
they can't live

01:22.817 --> 01:24.850
Harmoniously like women.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.251
Harmoniously?

01:26.853 --> 01:28.120
Like you and me?

01:28.122 --> 01:29.288
Oh, I was thinking more

01:29.290 --> 01:31.223
Of you and olivia.

01:31.391 --> 01:34.560
What a sweet,
generous girl you are.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.428
She and francis can't
keep away from each other,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.263
And you just take it in stride.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.799
Francis and I have
an understanding.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.167
Well, that's exactly
what I mean.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.103
Knowing that another girl
has his heart,

01:44.105 --> 01:45.804
You just soldier on,
serving the alliance.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.173
You have no idea what
is in francis's heart.

01:48.175 --> 01:50.576
I know francis is
not the sort

01:50.578 --> 01:53.178
To bed a girl
that he didn't love.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.515
I'm so pleased that you've made
room for her in your life,

01:56.517 --> 01:59.418
As I made room for diane.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.120
(trumpet playing)

02:05.725 --> 02:07.726
Olivia.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.661
Your majesty.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.597
A few comments
if you don't mind.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.800
First, well done on
getting my son into bed.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.535
But now you need
to keep him there.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.871
If you want to be
the queen of France...

02:18.873 --> 02:21.206
You want me to be
queen of France.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.674
I just wanted him back.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.476
Unfortunately,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.879
He loves mary.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.747
You can't know that.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.915
(quiet laugh)

02:29.917 --> 02:31.550
How much detail
would you like?

02:31.552 --> 02:32.784
Uh...

02:32.786 --> 02:34.620
When our passion
reached its limit,

02:34.622 --> 02:35.787
He called out a name.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.523
It was not mine.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.825
Hmm.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.693
Accept that I've lost.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.862
I have.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.666
Francis: On guard. (laughs)

02:47.668 --> 02:50.502
(francis grunting)

02:50.504 --> 02:51.670
It's not a toy, charles.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.805
It's an instrument
of diplomacy.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.907
Nanny:
Let's go, charles.

02:54.909 --> 02:57.309
My mother's fault.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.778
She's forcing everyone to learn
how to use these things.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.347
Forks.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.416
A neapolitan count is coming.
She doesn't want us

03:04.418 --> 03:06.685
To look like barbarians
before a fellow italian.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.754
Is that why your father has
asked you to stay?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.222
He must be greeted
by a king or a dauphin

03:10.224 --> 03:11.557
Or else it's an insult.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.758
Well, at least
you'll have more time

03:12.760 --> 03:13.926
To spend with olivia.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.662
In bed.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.964
Ah.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.803
We agreed our engagement
was strictly business.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.271
Mm, until it's not?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.839
I hate

03:27.841 --> 03:29.608
This plan of yours, francis.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.410
Do you have any
idea how it feels

03:31.412 --> 03:33.946
To watch you parade
your lover around court?

03:33.948 --> 03:35.581
I did no such thing.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.216
I can't help it
if the servants gossip.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.517
While I'm am in a
nunnery of one,

03:38.519 --> 03:40.485
Listening to your
mother crow over me.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.654
Is this what
you really want?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.790
Are we any happier
than we were before?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.258
No.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.293
But we don't know
what the future holds.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.996
We could be married off
to other people tomorrow

03:50.998 --> 03:53.332
If it were necessary.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.867
I didn't mean to hurt...

03:55.869 --> 03:58.737
I just needed to forget you
for a while.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.241
To forget that I can't have you.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.875
Mary, to stay sane,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.777
We must stay apart.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.616
You know it's true.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.822
So is your father telling you

04:16.824 --> 04:17.990
To get married?

04:17.992 --> 04:20.359
He would never
put it like that.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.495
The letter asks if I've met
any agreeable men.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.365
Of fortune.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.368
Your father seems
to expect a lot of you.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.902
My family's wealth comes
from mining.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.638
And the mines are playing out.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.506
I have to do my part.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.707
And all I've been raised to do

04:35.709 --> 04:38.377
Is dress nicely
and smile at men.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.845
I happen to like that smile.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.347
I can't even do that.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.649
I've never eaten an
egg in my whole life

04:43.651 --> 04:45.050
That someone else
didn't cook for me.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.852
Well, come here.

04:46.854 --> 04:47.853
Take the pan.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.655
No, I can't.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.589

05:00.634 --> 05:03.368
In a minute, you're going
to flip it over.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.536
It's easy, you'll see.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.305
It's like this.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.307
Only you have to have the
courage of your convictions.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.342
You have to mean it.
I mean it.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.077
The flip never works
without confidence.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.578

For you people upstairs.

Did you know there's hot

05:37.771 --> 05:40.772
Your troubles, they can't follow

but they have influence.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.052
The honorable count vincent,
of naples!

05:54.054 --> 05:55.754
There's no one
to misbehave in front of

05:55.756 --> 05:58.790
As french court is
nearly vacant.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.827
Smile. Remember, it was
less than a year ago

06:01.829 --> 06:04.730
That henry was at war
with half of Italy.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.901
(speaking italian)

06:10.937 --> 06:12.537
Your majesty.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.606
What a blessing to be in
your luminous presence.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.442
Grazie.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.846
I should explain my lack
of punctuality to king henry,

06:20.848 --> 06:23.682
But I see the son
and not the father.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.517
Unfortunately the king is
away at the moment.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.852
But what better host

06:26.854 --> 06:28.453
Than a fellow italian?

06:29.088 --> 06:30.122
Your majesty?

06:30.124 --> 06:31.123
I must ask the count's men

06:31.125 --> 06:32.591
For their weapons

06:32.593 --> 06:33.959
Before I show them
to their rooms.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.527
King henry would expect it.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.996
Of course. It's just
a formality, count.

06:37.998 --> 06:38.997
You don't mind?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.632
I insist.

06:43.836 --> 06:47.472
I thought you'd be going off
to fight with your father.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.740
I changed my mind.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.475
I've had enough
of killing for a while.

06:50.477 --> 06:53.145
Sebastian, have you thought
about what will happen to us

06:53.147 --> 06:54.746
When your father dies?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.114
Why should anything
happen to us?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.483
Francis will be king,
that's all.

06:58.485 --> 07:02.020
And you have such faith
in his love for you?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.022
Catherine will throw me
out of this castle

07:04.024 --> 07:05.524
Before henry's body is cold.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.192
And your brother's mercy is

07:07.194 --> 07:09.961
All that will stand
between you and death.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.031
What's the point of talking
about this?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.567
There's nothing either
of us can do to change things.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.969
What if you were no
longer a bastard?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.838
What if you were legitimized?

07:19.840 --> 07:22.007
Given legal status
as henry's son?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.677
Does father want this?

07:25.679 --> 07:26.778
Why shouldn't he want it?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.680
You've always been his favorite.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.048
And you've always said
we're his favorites

07:30.050 --> 07:31.583
Because we never ask him
for anything.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.852
It's not such an
unreasonable request.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.520
This is happening
all over europe.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.556
Kings claiming
their children.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.524
It's even been said
the bastard elizabeth

07:39.526 --> 07:41.793
May take the
throne in England.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.995
Well, that's certainly
not happening here.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.532
If henry's marriage

07:47.534 --> 07:49.668
To catherine were
to be annulled...

07:49.670 --> 07:51.069
That is treason.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.604
You're talking about changing

07:52.606 --> 07:53.872
The line of succession.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.540
And that's the sort of talk

07:55.542 --> 07:58.910
That gets bastards
and mistresses beheaded.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.013
Your grace.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.817
You must guard
her close, dauphin.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.085
Or someone might steal her away.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.153
(laughs softly)

08:08.155 --> 08:11.022
How delightful.
Ah.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.726
All of Italy has heard
of the gold goblets

08:14.728 --> 08:17.128
Given you by pope clement
on your marriage.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.732
No doubt you keep them
for more important guests.

08:23.069 --> 08:26.872
So, count, is this
your first visit to France?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.241
No, I was on french soil
less than a year ago

08:29.243 --> 08:30.809
To negotiate for my son.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.978
He was taken prisoner

08:32.980 --> 08:34.880
Along with some other officers
near the italian border.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.184
Nothing to be ashamed of.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.152
War is costly.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.821
One's money
must be recouped somehow.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.122
Holding hostages for ransom

08:44.124 --> 08:45.657
Is an old tradition.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.893
And did you secure
your son's release?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.594
Of course.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.830
Roberto was held
for eight months.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.599
I bargained like
any italian would-- shrewdly.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.935
I worked my way up through
two colonels and a general.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.870
And negotiated
with the king.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.773
And one day
he was returned to me.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.109
For 1,500 ducats.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.878
It is hard to appraise
the value of a human life.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.713
But now I know my son's.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.215
1,500 ducats.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.286
I have France to
thank for that...

09:14.288 --> 09:17.088
Clarity.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.593
To peace. And long friendship.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.661
To clarity.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.037
(sighs) I knew it,
I knew I'd be ridiculous.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.338
No, no,
you're-you're-you're fine.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.241
Very... Very peasant-looking.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.078
Who are you two?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.782
We're from the kitchen.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.618
Soft hands for a kitchen maid.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.087
All right, back to the kitchen,
both of you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.356
No one's leaving today.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.326
What's happening?
I think we've lost the castle.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.795
Tell me, your highness,
when do you expect king henry

09:56.797 --> 09:58.063
To return with his men?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.664
Quite soon.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.899
Knowing my father,

10:00.901 --> 10:02.968
He could return at any moment.
Really?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.202
I understand they traveled
to lorraine

10:04.204 --> 10:06.271
To put down some village unrest.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.174
And yet you seem surprised

10:09.176 --> 10:10.342
He wasn't here to greet you.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.376
(indistinct whispering)

10:11.378 --> 10:13.678
Mary?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.347
Go upstairs.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.781
Now.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.689
I can present this to henry
as a fait accompli.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.791
A "fait accompli."

10:26.793 --> 10:28.226
You've spoken
with the pope, have you?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.694
No.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.063
But I've spoken to
a cardinal or two.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.666
And you'd be surprised how
quick they are to respond

10:34.668 --> 10:36.267
When given a substantial bribe.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.336
Enough!

10:44.076 --> 10:45.243
It's never happening.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.245
Displacing my brother?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.147
Taking the throne of France
from him.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.154
He took it from you.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.857
You are the eldest son.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.858
No.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.992
Mother.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.193
I'm happy as I am.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.701
Count, perhaps it's time
to tell us why you're here.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.871
It's not a diplomatic visit.
Vincent:
You're right, dauphin.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.339
I've come for
restitution.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.174
Restitution?
The conditions

11:16.176 --> 11:18.243
Of my son's confinement
were not ideal.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.046
Roberto was returned
to me, yes,

11:21.048 --> 11:23.682
But he died of dysentery
on his journey home.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.817
Count, I'm so sorry.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.786
To outlive a child.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.187
The pain is...

11:29.189 --> 11:30.188
Unimaginable.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.289
Vincent:
My wife is dead,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.391
I have no
other children.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.760
I'm the last
of my name.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.296
Am I not due
satisfaction?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.198
Perhaps this discussion
should be postponed

11:40.200 --> 11:41.866
Until the king's
return.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.169
If I wanted to wait
for the king's return,

11:44.171 --> 11:45.737
I wouldn't have
camped in the woods

11:45.739 --> 11:47.072
For the last
three weeks,

11:47.074 --> 11:50.041
Waiting for henry
and his men to leave.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.976
You may leave
with your life.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.278
That is all
we can offer.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.281
No one is leaving, dauphin.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.149
<i>With your soldiers gone,</i>

11:58.151 --> 12:00.418
<i>My men control the entrance.</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:02.387
<i>They've taken your</i>
<i>few aged guards prisoner.</i>

12:02.389 --> 12:03.722
We have
their weapons.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.125
The castle is secured, my lord.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.027
This castle is now
under my protection

12:09.029 --> 12:11.296
Until I receive
satisfaction.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.931
You mean money.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.332
You're holding us
for ransom.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.067
Queen mary, I apologize.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.803
You are an innocent
in all this.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.005
Now we will
negotiate,

12:21.007 --> 12:22.273
One italian to another.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.081
(laughs)

12:32.785 --> 12:35.120
Where are you going,
pretty one?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.454
Excuse me.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.389
And why such a hurry?
And who are you?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.458
You'll find I'm
very good company.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
Not like these dogs.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.129
(scoffs)

12:44.131 --> 12:45.430
Get your hands off me!

12:45.432 --> 12:46.431
You have no idea whom
you're dealing with!

12:46.433 --> 12:47.532
Oh?

12:47.534 --> 12:48.533
Who are we
dealing with?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.368
I'm a special friend
of the king's.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.803
The king's away,

12:51.805 --> 12:53.972
Isn't he?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.341
Let her go.
I am the queen of scotland

12:56.343 --> 12:57.509
And that is my lady.

12:57.511 --> 12:58.910
Kenna, go upstairs.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.178
She's fine here.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.114
Is something wrong,
your grace?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.885
We're just having
a bit of fun with
this one, my lord.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.787
She's the king's whore.

13:10.389 --> 13:14.058
Soldiers must have
their... Indulgences.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.162
Of course, count, you know best.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.897
It's just...
Lady kenna would be

13:18.899 --> 13:20.465
So much more useful
to me upstairs.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.334
Indeed, now that you are
master of this castle,

13:23.336 --> 13:25.436
I humbly ask that
my scottish ladies and I

13:25.438 --> 13:26.905
Retire to
our chambers

13:26.907 --> 13:28.940
While you're negotiating
with the french.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.042
Oh, by your mercy.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.879
I suppose queens must also
have their indulgences.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.948
I trust that,
in return,

13:36.950 --> 13:39.050
You and your ladies
will join us for
the feast this evening.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.318
My men and I will
enjoy the best

13:40.320 --> 13:44.856
At king henry's table
before we go.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.960
Do not let the rough manners
of my men disturb you.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.563
My word as
a gentleman...

13:51.565 --> 13:52.831
You will not be harmed.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.365
Thank you, count.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.867
Of course we
will be there.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.937
I am... So grateful
for your protection.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.439
Kenna.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.512
What happened to greer?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.314
Do you think
the italians took her?

14:09.316 --> 14:10.849
(knock at door)

14:13.352 --> 14:14.586
Your grace.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.191
Greer, are you
all right?
Greer:
I can't stay long.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.860
I've been
in the kitchen.
Why are you

14:21.862 --> 14:23.194
Dressed like a servant?
Servants are
invisible.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.596
I thought I'd be safer
as one of them,

14:24.598 --> 14:26.164
So I borrowed
some clothes.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.332
So you're
actually working

14:27.334 --> 14:29.500
In the kitchen?
Trying to work,

14:29.502 --> 14:31.102
And making rather
a mess of it.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.904
What's going on up here?
Are you all right?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.305
Lola:
For the moment.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.274
All we can do is
wait to find out

14:36.276 --> 14:38.109
If the queen and francis
will strike a bargain
with the count.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.144
But I have never
been good at waiting.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.448
(water dripping)

14:47.887 --> 14:49.254
(rocks clatter)

14:52.057 --> 14:54.225
Clarissa?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.627
Are you there?

14:55.629 --> 14:58.363
There are men in the castle,
bad men,

14:58.365 --> 14:59.564
And they want to hurt us.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.165
We can't get out.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.068
There must be another way
out of the castle,

15:04.070 --> 15:06.237
Through these tunnels.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.339
I need you to mark me a path,

15:08.341 --> 15:09.908
A safe path...

15:11.510 --> 15:14.045
...So I can get people
out of here.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.949
Please.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.957
(scraping sound)

15:38.570 --> 15:40.705
That is ten times

15:40.707 --> 15:42.407
What you paid
for your son.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.276
Think of all the things
you could buy with that gold.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.412
It is a generous offer.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.579
But...

15:48.581 --> 15:50.682
(sighs)

15:50.684 --> 15:52.450
...It does not grant me
satisfaction.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.588
Of course.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.991
Gold will not
resurrect your son,

15:59.993 --> 16:01.392
Or your family line.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.162
What you need, count,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.197
Is a bride.
Mother...

16:06.199 --> 16:07.365
The queen of scotland
is unmarried

16:07.367 --> 16:08.366
And still a virgin.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.667
She could
give you sons.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.569
Royal sons.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.971
Take her back
with you.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.106
Demand ransom,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.607
Or force a marriage.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.242
Once she's ruined,
she'd have to accept.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.412
Vincent:
That is a generous offer.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.381
Does the dauphin agree?
No.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.283
No, the dauphin thinks
his mother is underbidding.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.284
Francis...

16:26.286 --> 16:27.618
You don't
want a wife.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.220
You want revenge.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.155
So take it.

16:32.424 --> 16:33.758
Take me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
Fra... My son
is not well.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.528
Francis,
you are not...
Take me for ransom.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.163
We can leave for
Italy tonight.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.466
And you will have
the heir to France

16:41.468 --> 16:43.001
As your hostage.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.369
At last.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.304
A serious offer.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.475
And one I will accept.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.188
What do they call you?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.323
"bastard," mostly.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.625
(laughs)

17:08.427 --> 17:10.461
What's this for?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.063
I'm a nice man.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.032
Thanks,
I appreciate it.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.800
I don't suppose you could
talk to someone about...

17:17.436 --> 17:20.271
...Getting me out of here?

17:26.612 --> 17:28.679
<i>Grazie.</i>

17:33.552 --> 17:36.220
How did the
bargaining go?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.356
They're taking francis.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.624
For ransom?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.059
He gave
himself up.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.428
To save you
and the rest of us.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.196
He would.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.565
Yes, his integrity
can be annoying.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.567
But we can't
let it happen.
I agree.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.768
That's why I've come here.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.103
We must get him,
and all of our people,

17:52.105 --> 17:53.337
Out of this place.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.739
Yes.
The secret
passageways

17:54.741 --> 17:56.340
Underneath the castle...
Oh.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.775
For a moment,
I thought you had a plan.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.844
The passageways
are a maze.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.513
They're full of pitfalls,
unstable ground.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.315
They're a death trap
to anyone

18:04.317 --> 18:06.317
Who doesn't know
a safe way through,
and no one does.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.519
I do.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.455
I used to play down there
when I was a child.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.323
I know that there is
a passage that runs

18:12.325 --> 18:13.658
From a hidden door

18:13.660 --> 18:15.660
In the main hall,
through the tunnels,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.662
And comes out by the stables.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.197
I've marked it with chalk.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.734
So we should just
all troop down
to the main hall

18:23.736 --> 18:25.136
And out through
your secret door?

18:25.138 --> 18:26.571
How secret
will it be

18:26.573 --> 18:28.706
With a dozen italians
patrolling the halls?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.141
It's our
only chance.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.210
But stay here
and die if you wish.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.612
Or you could allow me
to improve on your plan.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.549
We need
a distraction.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.319
Something to remove these
animals from our halls

18:41.321 --> 18:44.422
And collect them in one place.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.457
The count's feast
should do nicely.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.293
The count expects us
to attend his feast.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.595
How can we do that

18:50.597 --> 18:52.497
And escape at
the same time?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.898
That's just
the point.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.434
If we're all there,
he'll suspect nothing.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.603
Francis is under
guard in his room,

18:58.605 --> 19:00.838
They won't expect him
at the feast.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.774
We need to buy him time,
a head start to get free

19:03.776 --> 19:05.810
And get our people out,
all of them.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.246
The women, the children,
the servants.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.881
You know he won't leave
without them.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.216
We'll keep
the count

19:12.218 --> 19:13.851
And his men busy,

19:13.853 --> 19:15.520
And when our people
are safely out,

19:15.522 --> 19:16.721
We'll follow suit.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.589
How?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.158
Once we are seated
at the feast,

19:20.160 --> 19:21.792
There is no way
out of that room.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.395
We'll find an excuse
to get you and the girls away.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.264
Don't you think the count
will find it suspicious

19:26.266 --> 19:28.666
If all of his guests
start leaving?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.538
That's why
I'll remain behind.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.841
The queen of France,
in their power.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.943
Why would they
expect a trap?

19:38.945 --> 19:40.578
You?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.646
Yes.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.713
A martyr?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.283
How can I trust you?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.518
You've been trying to get
rid of me since I arrived.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.887
Whatever has been
between us,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.289
Believe me now.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.791
Believe that
I love my son.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.860
I would go into
hell for him.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.828
How far will you go?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.867
I swear on
my immortal soul

20:02.869 --> 20:04.435
That I will be

20:04.437 --> 20:06.904
The last person
out of that room.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.875
Our options are extremely
limited right now.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.611
There's no one
left to trust
but each other.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.880
Or perhaps you'd prefer
to trust the count?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.281
You've looked
into his eyes,

20:17.283 --> 20:18.683
As have I.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.284
If francis
leaves with him,

20:20.286 --> 20:23.654
Do you truly think
he'll ever come back?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.756
No.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.725
The count will
kill him.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.295
It seems that we will go
into hell together, then.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.368
Mary:
Francis, no.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.703
Not your brothers, too.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.871
The count was
in here earlier.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.307
He actually played
with charles for
a few minutes.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.575
You'd think that someone
who played with a child

20:44.577 --> 20:46.277
Would enjoy it,
but his eyes were dead.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.447
Gold is useless.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.716
He's lost his line.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.351
He wants to take father's
in return.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.387
This is why you must
agree to our plan.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.756
The plan is madness.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.392
I've seen the way
the count looks at you.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.327
And you're asking me
to leave you with him?

21:03.329 --> 21:05.296
With my mother?

21:05.298 --> 21:06.564
You know you
can't trust her.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.432
No, if I get
out of this room,

21:08.434 --> 21:11.602
The first thing I'll do
is come for you.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.704
If you come for me,
they will kill you,

21:13.706 --> 21:15.873
And your brothers
will be lost.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.575
I won't leave you.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.976
This is not
negotiable.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.412
Mary...

21:21.414 --> 21:22.580
I...

21:22.582 --> 21:24.582
I know.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.850
I'm sorry.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.718
About olivia.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.953
About all
the foolish ways

21:28.955 --> 21:30.321
That I've tried
to manage things.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.623
None of that
matters now.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.991
Your brothers,

21:33.993 --> 21:36.027
The others who
are trapped here,

21:36.029 --> 21:38.062
They are our people now.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.867
If we are to rule
as king and queen,

21:42.869 --> 21:45.069
We must trust each other
to do what is necessary.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.642
I believe that you can
lead them to safety.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.011
Believe that I can
get myself out of that room.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.813
My god, mary...

22:06.458 --> 22:08.592
Promise me you
won't come back.

22:08.594 --> 22:09.960
(door opens)

22:36.988 --> 22:38.989
Is that clear?
Once the door is shut,

22:38.991 --> 22:40.991
It cannot be opened again
from the outside.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.127
(clears throat)

22:43.129 --> 22:45.429
My dear,
you look lovely.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.732
(men speaking low,
indistinctly)

22:47.734 --> 22:50.835
(door opens, closes)

22:50.837 --> 22:56.440
You will wait until you hear
two sharp taps.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.676
You will open it first
for francis,

22:58.678 --> 23:01.579
And later for me.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.883
Why must I be the one
to wait in the dark?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.818
Is this your idea of revenge?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.820
Because the count
won't miss you,
silly girl.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.423
Only mary's ladies were
invited to the feast.

23:12.425 --> 23:16.427
No.
And if you fail in
your duties in any way,

23:16.429 --> 23:19.697
I promise you will meet
with my extreme displeasure.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.707
You must close
the door completely,

23:29.709 --> 23:32.643
Or the guards
will find you.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.628
(rustling)

23:52.531 --> 23:54.799
(door squeaks open)

23:56.134 --> 23:59.437
Count says anyone
who flouts his authority

23:59.439 --> 24:01.005
Gets a death sentence.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.488
Why aren't you killing me?

24:18.757 --> 24:21.225
Your mother's paying me
to look after you.

24:24.896 --> 24:28.532
Yes, apparently she's good
at bribes.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.167
Mary, I can't do it.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.535
Think of how angry
they'll be

24:31.537 --> 24:33.103
When they discover
they've been tricked.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.039
We'll be gone before they do.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.507
Aylee:
What if it doesn't work?

24:36.509 --> 24:37.775
What if he
doesn't believe you?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.109
(knocking)

24:40.111 --> 24:42.980
(men talking, laughing
in distance)

24:48.520 --> 24:49.987
I know what you're thinking.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.889
It's what any woman <i>would</i> think.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.526
But I've come to tell you
not to be afraid.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.927
I'll be there
when you enter the room

24:56.929 --> 24:58.796
And I'll be there
when you leave.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.798
Get through this night,

25:00.800 --> 25:03.834
And these men will be gone
from your lives.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.270
And suddenly you care about us?

25:06.272 --> 25:07.938
Aylee:
Lola, she wants to help,

25:07.940 --> 25:09.807
To shield us
from these evil men.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.209
Please, when has the french
court not been full

25:12.211 --> 25:14.044
Of evil men? And women?

25:14.046 --> 25:15.646
Since we got here,

25:15.648 --> 25:18.516
We've been lied to by people
who smile

25:18.518 --> 25:21.151
And say pretty things
as they stab us
in the back.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.287
At least these men don't pretend
to be our friends.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.922
I agree with lola.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.891
You come in here
mouthing platitudes,

25:26.893 --> 25:28.893
But you have no idea
what this is like,

25:28.895 --> 25:30.261
To have a target on your back.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.863
I know exactly
what this is like.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.733
When I was eight years old,

25:35.735 --> 25:37.768
Rebels stormed
the florentine palace.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.071
Both my parents
were already dead,
but my name

25:41.073 --> 25:43.774
And my family's fortunes made me
a target.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.609
At eight years old?

25:45.611 --> 25:48.746
War doesn't spare children.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.314
I was held hostage for years,

25:50.316 --> 25:52.550
Until finally they had
to decide what to do with

25:52.552 --> 25:54.852
This medici girl.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.688
Many of the soldiers,
men like these,

25:57.690 --> 26:00.257
They demanded that I be turned
over to them

26:00.259 --> 26:04.261
So that they would...

26:04.263 --> 26:06.196
So that I would be shared.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.834
And I can still hear
their laughter outside
the convent.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.003
That <i>sickening</i> laughter.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.605
What happened?

26:14.607 --> 26:16.307
The nuns and I prayed.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.709
We prayed for god
to send the pope

26:18.711 --> 26:21.145
And his armies to retake
the city and rescue me in time.

26:21.147 --> 26:25.249
And then one day...

26:25.251 --> 26:26.884
The laughter stopped.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.153
It grew quiet.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.988
And I stepped out

26:30.990 --> 26:35.292
Into the sunlight,
over their bodies,

26:35.294 --> 26:38.662
And pope clement welcomed me
into his arms.

26:40.165 --> 26:41.599
I emerged intact

26:41.601 --> 26:44.835
And so will you
if you have faith.

26:56.815 --> 27:00.117
Gentlemen, please,
my gift to you.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.824
(men clamoring, laughing)

27:08.360 --> 27:09.360
(bell tolling)

27:09.362 --> 27:10.894
Shh...

27:16.167 --> 27:17.768
(bell continues tolling)

27:17.770 --> 27:19.069
(men laughing)

27:20.238 --> 27:22.673
After you, your grace.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.177
(child screams)

27:29.180 --> 27:30.280
(quietly):
Don't look.

27:32.717 --> 27:35.052
(bell continues tolling)
mmm.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.187
(boisterous conversations)

27:39.424 --> 27:41.792
(bell continues tolling)

27:42.727 --> 27:44.895
(grunts)

27:46.431 --> 27:48.032
(pole clatters)

27:49.234 --> 27:51.201
(guard shouts in italian)

28:01.212 --> 28:03.981
I need you to keep quiet
and keep behind me.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.182
Come on.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.720
Everyone!
Look, it's happening now.

28:09.722 --> 28:13.123
You have to go meet the prince
in the south hall.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.725
Go. Come on.
I'll keep serving.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.393
If you're
the only servant left,

28:16.395 --> 28:18.062
The italians
will suspect something.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.998
(whistles softly)

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
(groans)

28:27.272 --> 28:29.940
Come on, quickly.

28:34.879 --> 28:35.979
Down the stairs.
Wait for me at the bottom.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.152
God save you.
Thank you, your highness.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.762
I hear the guards walking by.
I know they'll find me.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.163
Olivia, you need
to wait here.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.399
You need to wait for mary
and her ladies,

28:55.401 --> 28:57.167
Or they'll be trapped.

28:57.169 --> 29:00.137
So I must stay
for the woman
you really love.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.806
I'm nothing to you
or your mother

29:02.808 --> 29:05.509
But a game piece to move
back and forth at your will!

29:05.511 --> 29:07.978
She crushed my reputation
like you crush an insect,

29:07.980 --> 29:09.913
And you're just as bad!
My mother?

29:09.915 --> 29:12.382
Whatever you're upset
about we can discuss later.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.852
Right now we need
you here, urgently.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.787
Lives are at risk.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.396
(men laughing)

29:31.136 --> 29:34.071
Count...

29:34.073 --> 29:36.273
I'm-I'm afraid
I'm feeling a little bit...

29:36.275 --> 29:38.275
Straitlaced?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.543
I beg your pardon?

29:39.545 --> 29:41.545
It's difficult to breathe.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.081
Are you ill, your grace?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.482
No, my lord...

29:45.484 --> 29:46.884
It's my...

29:48.419 --> 29:50.921
(whispers):
...Corset.

29:55.160 --> 30:00.497
Perhaps you should
retire until the...

30:00.499 --> 30:03.033
Crisis is averted.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.035
Thank you, count.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.104
It's so difficult
without servants.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.438
My ladies will
attend me.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.180
This way.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.529
This way. Come on.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.138
(guards speaking italian)

30:41.140 --> 30:42.539
(laughing)

30:45.543 --> 30:48.145
Mary, where are you?

30:48.147 --> 30:52.883
Francis, are you leaving us?

30:54.919 --> 30:56.553
Go. Go. Go, go.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.073
Perhaps it's
the wrong panel.

31:20.278 --> 31:23.280
Olivia?

31:23.282 --> 31:26.149
Hurry, it only opens
from the inside.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.652
Olivia?!

31:28.654 --> 31:31.321
(banging continues)
olivia!

31:36.461 --> 31:39.196
Bruno
what's this?

31:42.500 --> 31:45.535
Where's the girl
with the soft hands?

31:47.138 --> 31:49.072
Where's everybody?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.281
(both grunting)

32:07.191 --> 32:08.525
(gasps)

32:12.597 --> 32:15.065
(grunting)

32:15.067 --> 32:17.601
(yells)

32:17.603 --> 32:19.670
(both screaming)

32:36.054 --> 32:37.421
(grunts)

32:39.724 --> 32:41.224
I meant it.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.997
Is he dead?
Did I kill him?

33:09.354 --> 33:11.088
One of us killed him.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.990
No way to tell which one.

33:15.259 --> 33:16.526
(gasps)

33:23.601 --> 33:25.302
Count vincent sent me
to find you.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.371
Oh, we were just
on our way back.

33:32.577 --> 33:35.312
(squeaking)

33:44.288 --> 33:46.723
(running footsteps)

33:46.725 --> 33:48.358
(shrieks)

33:48.360 --> 33:50.193
What are you?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.162
(men laughing)

33:56.634 --> 33:58.769
Count vincent...

34:00.705 --> 34:03.407
...Isn't this enough?

34:07.278 --> 34:10.280
You know the king will go to war
for his heirs.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.681
What of it?

34:11.683 --> 34:14.618
Can henry give me
the life I had a year ago?

34:15.753 --> 34:17.621
Then let the heavens fall.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.425
Enough.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.227
Thank you for this
generous feast.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.563
Now we will be
on our way.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.698
Please.

34:28.700 --> 34:32.569
Please do not take my children.
What else can I give you?

34:35.840 --> 34:37.474
Do you want women?

34:38.509 --> 34:40.710
Take them. Take their virtue.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.446
Catherine, no!
You liar!

34:42.448 --> 34:44.448
They won't dare say a word
about it. They'd be ruined!

34:44.450 --> 34:45.449
You can have them,
you can have anything...

34:45.451 --> 34:47.184
Give me your heart then.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.186
Carve it out
and hand it to me

34:49.188 --> 34:51.254
So that we might
understand one another.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.857
<i>That</i> is diplomacy;

34:53.859 --> 34:56.660
To understand my loss.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.863
To carry the weight of your dead
heart with you

34:59.865 --> 35:02.766
Every night and day
until you find your grave!

35:05.236 --> 35:07.337
Roberto.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.210
Give me roberto...

35:13.212 --> 35:16.146
And I will let
your children live.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.895
Forgive me, mary...

35:35.633 --> 35:38.135
...For I am not
a gentle man.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.303
(women gasp, scream)

35:45.843 --> 35:49.212
Give yourself airs,
do you?
Kenna!

35:50.648 --> 35:52.315
Will you not stop this?
Have you no honor?!

35:55.386 --> 35:56.586
Count vincent.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.423
Count vincent!

36:00.425 --> 36:03.326
Do you know why
your son is dead?
Because of you.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.863
Because, unlike me,
you aren't willing
to pay the necessary price.

36:06.865 --> 36:11.768
So I'll make you a new offer.
Take your hands off of mary

36:11.770 --> 36:14.738
And I'll let you leave
this castle with your life.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.710
My lord? My lord!

36:21.612 --> 36:24.314
(men groaning)

36:31.589 --> 36:32.889
Vincent:
No...

36:32.891 --> 36:36.726
We... We ate
the same food.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.862
We drank my wine.
Poison is an art.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.431
And the essence of art
is surprise.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.766
The gold.

36:47.438 --> 36:51.241
I never touched your gold,
medici bitch.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.542
(mary gasps)

36:52.544 --> 36:53.910
(vincent groans)

37:00.451 --> 37:03.520
(women shriek)

37:08.326 --> 37:10.527
Your son awaits you.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.568
It's all right,
kenna.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.836
Catherine saved us.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.605
All right.
It's all right.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.873
Aylee:
Why didn't you tell us?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.376
I learned long ago
that only a secret known

37:26.378 --> 37:27.877
By one person
remains a secret.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.347
And of course, I...

37:30.349 --> 37:33.783
I wasn't sure
it would work.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.253
Kenna, I'm so sorry.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.587
I'll be all right.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.623
Francis:
I'll get her
to the infirmary.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.525
Here. Come with me.
Take my arm.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.960
It's all right.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.466
That could have been me.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.001
Or worse.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.403
Why did you stop
the count?

37:53.405 --> 37:56.339
Why didn't you
just let him...

37:56.341 --> 37:57.641
Finish me off...

37:57.643 --> 38:01.378
Ruined my chances
of marrying francis?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.913
You risked your life for my son.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.516
Perhaps I owed you...

38:06.518 --> 38:08.418
A moment of respect.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.954
You called them animals.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.890
Soldiers, laughing.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.726
That sound you
couldn't forget.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.428
That story you told us,

38:18.430 --> 38:21.998
They didn't make in time,
did they?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.833
In florence?

38:23.835 --> 38:25.969
The first lesson I ever learned

38:25.971 --> 38:27.971
Was never to wait
for a man's rescue.

38:27.973 --> 38:31.374
History is written
by the survivors.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.644
And I am surely that.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.859
Diane:
<i>Thank heavens it's over.</i>

38:49.861 --> 38:51.695
Mother, when you said
there was circumstances

38:51.697 --> 38:52.996
Under which the vatican
would agree

38:52.998 --> 38:54.531
To my taking
the throne.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.965
Things change politically
all the time.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.001
Politics, yes.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.804
I thought you might mean
that if francis and his brothers

39:00.806 --> 39:04.641
Were taken, or dead,
everyone would turn to me.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.109
I'm of age to wed mary,

39:06.111 --> 39:08.411
And henry would have a son
of his own blood.

39:08.413 --> 39:10.080
I have the sense
you're suggesting something.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.715
I noticed
count vincent's men

39:11.717 --> 39:14.117
Were remarkably gentle with me,
when you think about it.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.585
Even before you'd had

39:15.587 --> 39:17.854
The chance to pay them
for their kindness.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.924
What else did you do?

39:20.926 --> 39:22.926
Did you tell the count
when father would be gone?

39:22.928 --> 39:25.729
You were meant to be away
with your father,

39:25.731 --> 39:27.997
And then you would have
missed it all.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.467
He is my brother.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.469
They took me in as family.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.738
You are blood, not brothers.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.707
Blood that catherine
wishes she could spill.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.109
Stop this. This is poison.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.677
You are not family.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.712
You are a complication
of henry's lust

39:42.714 --> 39:44.147
That they endure.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.150
These are the people
that you want to protect.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.029
I couldn't sleep.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.499
Mary...

40:06.971 --> 40:08.772
Why? Why did you come back?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.640
You didn't know
the gold was poisoned!
Mary, stop.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.777
It was one man against ten.
They would have killed you!

40:13.779 --> 40:14.978
Why would you do
something so stupid?

40:14.980 --> 40:16.479
Because I love you.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.848
What?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.617
And because
it's pretty obvious now

40:20.619 --> 40:23.987
That for us to stay sane,
we need to be together.

40:26.757 --> 40:30.427
But what about not having
control of our lives...?

40:34.732 --> 40:37.734
And-and France
and-and scotland...?

40:45.676 --> 40:49.145
There has been entirely
too much thinking going on.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.764
Tell me when you
want me to stop.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.201
Never.
