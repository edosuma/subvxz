00:01.437 --> 00:03.138
JOE:
You think she got in?

00:03.206 --> 00:05.173
ALLISON:
I don't know.

00:05.241 --> 00:07.309
I mean, it's kind of thick.

00:07.377 --> 00:08.543
Thick is good, right?

00:08.611 --> 00:10.879
Thick is good.
Thick is good.

00:10.947 --> 00:12.848
You want to take a look?

00:12.915 --> 00:14.816
What are you talking about?
We can't take a look.

00:14.884 --> 00:15.917
It's addressed to Ariel.

00:15.985 --> 00:16.952
Why not?

00:17.020 --> 00:18.987
Come on, no one will know.

00:19.055 --> 00:21.023
You just steam open
the envelope right here

00:21.090 --> 00:22.457
and then you reseal it.
No.

00:22.525 --> 00:24.092
Joe, come on.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.427
Cornell's her dream school.

00:25.495 --> 00:28.397
Ariel should be the one
to find out first if she got in.

00:29.799 --> 00:32.299
(door opening)

00:32.368 --> 00:34.269
(door closing)

00:34.337 --> 00:35.270
ARIEL:
Mom?

00:35.338 --> 00:36.938
Dad? Anybody home?

00:37.006 --> 00:40.242
Home, yes, yes, we're
home. Here we are.

00:40.309 --> 00:41.910
We're just waiting
in the kitchen.

00:41.978 --> 00:43.445
Just growing older
by the minute.

00:43.513 --> 00:45.781
Waiting for you...

00:45.848 --> 00:47.916
ALLISON:
Oh, I didn't know

00:47.984 --> 00:50.419
you were with somebody.

00:50.486 --> 00:54.089
Um, Mom, Dad, this is
my friend Kyle Covington.

00:54.157 --> 00:55.657
Ms. Dubois.

00:55.725 --> 00:58.560
Hi. Nice to meet you, Kyle.

00:58.628 --> 00:59.561
Mr. Dubois.

00:59.629 --> 01:00.695
It's nice to
meet you, Kyle.

01:00.763 --> 01:01.730
You're just in time.

01:01.798 --> 01:03.465
Ariel's just about
to open a letter

01:03.533 --> 01:06.501
that she got from
the admissions office
at Cornell University.

01:08.671 --> 01:11.006
Or you could just
leave it there

01:11.074 --> 01:13.075
and watch while your
father has a heart attack.

01:13.142 --> 01:14.776
Your call.

01:14.844 --> 01:18.246
Um... you know what,

01:18.314 --> 01:21.083
it kind of doesn't matter.

01:21.150 --> 01:23.985
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

01:24.053 --> 01:26.488
It's Cornell. It's
your dream school.

01:29.325 --> 01:31.493
Um...

01:33.262 --> 01:35.864
It doesn't matter
because I'm pregnant.

01:35.932 --> 01:38.600
(gasps)

01:38.668 --> 01:41.069
Bad dream.

01:41.137 --> 01:44.840
The worst ever.

02:33.790 --> 02:36.192
So this mystery kid Kyle--
did he seem nice?

02:36.260 --> 02:37.760
Was he nice?

02:38.928 --> 02:40.428
Yeah, you're saying
that he's going to be

02:40.496 --> 02:42.564
the father of my grandchild,
and that's like, you know,

02:42.632 --> 02:43.999
it's like Christmases and
Thanksgivings and birthdays.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.968
And I just want to know
if I was going to like the guy.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.704
I can't believe you're
joking about all this.

02:49.772 --> 02:53.008
She's giving up her future--
everything she's worked for.

02:53.075 --> 02:55.977
And you're asking me if the kid
she's giving it up for is nice?

02:56.045 --> 02:59.147
Do you really think that this
is one of those dreams?

02:59.215 --> 03:00.949
I mean, even I've had
dreams like that.

03:01.017 --> 03:04.052
Every parent with a daughter
has dreams like that.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.454
What are you looking for anyway?

03:06.522 --> 03:07.589
The camcorder.

03:07.657 --> 03:09.591
I thought I had it
in the case.

03:09.659 --> 03:12.427
I want to tape Bridgette at
the clarinet recital she's got.

03:12.495 --> 03:14.129
I want to make sure
it's charged.

03:14.196 --> 03:15.430
I think
I saw the girls

03:15.498 --> 03:17.966
playing with it
the other day.

03:18.034 --> 03:19.935
Have you taken
a look in there?

03:21.304 --> 03:22.671
Aw...

03:22.738 --> 03:25.774
Aha, here it is.

03:25.841 --> 03:27.742
Why didn't I know that?

03:27.810 --> 03:29.844
Okay, now one bar.

03:29.912 --> 03:31.546
See? I'm glad I looked.

03:31.614 --> 03:33.081
What's this?

03:33.149 --> 03:36.484
(groans)

03:36.552 --> 03:38.687
Really!

03:38.754 --> 03:40.722
(yelling)

03:42.858 --> 03:44.259
JOE:
Did you tape this?

03:44.327 --> 03:45.427
BRIDGETTE:
Yeah.

03:45.494 --> 03:47.295
Why, Bridge?

03:47.363 --> 03:48.663
I don't know.

03:48.731 --> 03:50.298
He's funny.

03:50.366 --> 03:52.033
No, that is not right.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.635
Just because you think
this man's funny,

03:53.703 --> 03:55.704
doesn't mean
you can tape him
without telling him.

03:55.771 --> 03:57.572
He's our neighbor and you
violated his privacy.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
No, not really.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.041
He doesn't even
know about it.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.876
No, just because he
doesn't know about it

04:01.944 --> 04:03.144
doesn't mean it's
not a violation.

04:03.212 --> 04:05.113
What are we going
to do about this, huh?

04:05.181 --> 04:07.882
You're not going to make me
apologize, are you?

04:07.950 --> 04:10.185
Because then he would
know about it,

04:10.252 --> 04:12.120
and that would just
make things worse, right?

04:12.188 --> 04:14.456
The first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to delete this,

04:14.523 --> 04:15.957
and the second thing
I'm going to do

04:16.024 --> 04:17.759
is I'm going to forbid you
from using this camera again.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.261
Go to your room and finish
getting ready for school.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.997
You too, Tonto.

04:22.064 --> 04:23.598
Girls, come on.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.700
Five minutes and
we're out of here.

04:25.768 --> 04:28.637
Um...

04:28.704 --> 04:33.041
So, um, I was wondering--

04:33.109 --> 04:35.610
would it be okay if I came home
after dinner tonight?

04:35.678 --> 04:38.079
What's going on?

04:38.147 --> 04:39.814
Well, I have S.A.T. prep
this afternoon,

04:39.882 --> 04:42.417
and then I was going to go over
to my friend Casey's house.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.085
We have an A.P. chem test
this Wednesday

04:44.153 --> 04:45.520
and we were going
to study together.

04:45.588 --> 04:47.355
I guess so.

04:47.423 --> 04:50.358
But who's Casey?
Do we know her?

04:50.426 --> 04:52.661
No, you don't know her.

04:52.728 --> 04:55.263
And don't get crazy, but...

04:57.133 --> 04:58.667
Casey's not a her.

04:58.734 --> 04:59.901
A boy?

05:01.604 --> 05:04.939
Well, when were you going
to tell us this?

05:05.007 --> 05:07.042
I don't know,
I'm telling you now.

05:07.109 --> 05:12.847
So, uh, is this a boy
you study with, or...?

05:16.686 --> 05:18.720
I mean, we like each other.

05:18.788 --> 05:20.155
And then we hang out.

05:20.222 --> 05:23.358
We haven't gone on a date
yet or anything.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.994
So, is it okay?

05:26.062 --> 05:28.430
Well, I guess I'm just
a little confused.

05:28.497 --> 05:29.497
(nervous chuckle)

05:30.900 --> 05:38.206
Um, did, um, did Casey's mom
invite you to dinner?

05:38.274 --> 05:40.842
I mean, I don't know,
he mentioned it.

05:40.910 --> 05:43.812
So I-I don't know if his mother
is, you know...

05:43.879 --> 05:47.716
I'll tell you what, why don't
you guys go do the S.A.T. prep

05:47.783 --> 05:49.784
and then you and Casey
come back here.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.823
You-you want me
to bring him here?

05:54.890 --> 05:56.558
Yeah. Sure, why not?

05:56.625 --> 05:58.493
We got food, we got dinner.

05:58.561 --> 06:01.262
You guys can study
in the living room.

06:01.330 --> 06:02.764
Sounds good to me.

06:05.267 --> 06:07.535
You think it over,
okay, honey?

06:07.603 --> 06:09.571
And talk about it with Casey.

06:09.638 --> 06:11.973
But either way, I want you
back here for dinner.

06:13.809 --> 06:16.377
Great.

06:16.445 --> 06:19.948
SCANLON:
The guy's name is
Earl Sanderson. 55.

06:20.983 --> 06:22.917
Window was jimmied.

06:22.985 --> 06:24.519
A couple things missing.

06:24.587 --> 06:26.788
It kind of looks like
a robbery gone wrong, right?

06:26.856 --> 06:29.257
I don't know.
Why are you looking at me?

06:29.325 --> 06:31.392
I'm not even sure
why you want me here.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.394
The guy's facedown
in the fridge.

06:33.462 --> 06:34.796
Facedown.

06:34.864 --> 06:36.931
What's he doing, offering
the robber a beer?

06:36.999 --> 06:39.734
Or did the petty thief break in,
realize that the guy was home

06:39.802 --> 06:41.903
and shoot in the back
'cause he relished the idea

06:41.971 --> 06:43.605
of turning his
breaking and entering

06:43.672 --> 06:46.608
into a crime that
would get him either life
or the electric chair?

06:46.675 --> 06:50.478
I don't know-- my Spidey sense
is telling me that all is
not what it appears to be,

06:50.546 --> 06:53.414
and I was hoping that my
friend that sometimes sees
things that aren't there

06:53.482 --> 06:55.083
might help to shed some light.

06:55.151 --> 06:58.119
We got a partial
sneaker print

06:58.187 --> 06:59.487
off the dirt outside
the window,

06:59.555 --> 07:01.256
but other than that,
I got nothing.

07:01.323 --> 07:03.158
(motor starting)

07:03.225 --> 07:04.759
<i>MAN:
No! No, please!</i>

07:04.827 --> 07:08.029
No, no, please!

07:08.097 --> 07:10.932
Please, please,
please don't do this!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.902
Please don't do this to me!

07:13.969 --> 07:16.137
Someone help! Help!

07:16.205 --> 07:17.872
Help me!

07:17.940 --> 07:20.441
Help me! Help me!

07:20.509 --> 07:23.678
Someone, help!

07:23.746 --> 07:25.480
Please, please don't do this!

07:25.548 --> 07:27.015
Please, please...

07:27.082 --> 07:28.917
Why are you doing
this to me?!

07:28.984 --> 07:32.120
Please, please
don't do this!

07:32.188 --> 07:33.621
No, no, no!

07:33.689 --> 07:35.156
No!

07:42.998 --> 07:45.967
You know what, I don't think
I'm going to be able to tell you

07:46.035 --> 07:48.469
who killed this man.

07:48.537 --> 07:51.806
But I might be able to tell you
about somebody this man killed.

07:51.874 --> 07:54.709
(wheezing laugh)

07:57.646 --> 08:00.915
(laughing continues)

08:05.921 --> 08:09.290
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.159
You got to come over
and see this thing

08:11.227 --> 08:12.560
my buddy forwarded me.

08:12.628 --> 08:14.362
This dude is freaking out.

08:14.430 --> 08:15.463
Come here.

08:15.531 --> 08:17.398
Come here.

08:19.068 --> 08:21.469
Look at this.

08:23.706 --> 08:27.442
(yelling)
(laughing)

08:32.248 --> 08:33.847
Your friend found this
on the Internet?

08:33.916 --> 08:34.982
Yeah.

08:35.049 --> 08:37.018
This guy's hilarious.

08:38.453 --> 08:40.388
<i>ALLISON:
Okay, who is this man?</i>

08:40.456 --> 08:42.323
Do we know his name?

08:42.390 --> 08:44.492
I don't know.
He's just some guy.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.861
Some guy that lives around here.

08:46.929 --> 08:48.363
Some guy?

08:48.430 --> 08:50.431
Bridgette, he's a person.

08:50.499 --> 08:51.966
He has feelings.

08:52.034 --> 08:53.701
Now you've exposed him
to public ridicule.

08:53.769 --> 08:55.837
JOE:
Last time I looked

08:55.905 --> 08:58.539
thousands of people
had clicked on the video,

08:58.607 --> 09:01.042
and there are 60
or 70 comments, so...

09:01.110 --> 09:03.411
After dinner, you and your dad
are taking those videos down.

09:03.479 --> 09:04.946
And then you're banned
from the computer.

09:05.014 --> 09:06.180
Until when?!

09:06.248 --> 09:07.916
Until I say you're not.

09:07.983 --> 09:10.518
ARIEL:
Mom, Dad?

09:10.586 --> 09:12.520
Be nice to your
sister's friend.

09:12.588 --> 09:14.289
In the kitchen.

09:15.925 --> 09:19.794
Um, Mom, Dad, this
is my friend Casey.

09:19.862 --> 09:21.996
Casey, this is
my family.

09:22.064 --> 09:23.598
There's another sister
running around here somewhere.

09:23.666 --> 09:28.569
I'm Kyle, Kyle Covington.
Everyone calls me Casey.

09:28.637 --> 09:30.238
Mrs. Dubois.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.276
I know that you dreamt that
this kid got Ariel pregnant,

09:35.344 --> 09:37.879
and wrecked her future
and everything, but...
But?

09:37.947 --> 09:40.548
But I don't know, but he
seemed kind of nice to me.

09:43.519 --> 09:44.619
He did.

09:44.687 --> 09:46.120
He was polite and respectful.

09:46.188 --> 09:47.455
And he seemed kind of smart.

09:47.556 --> 09:49.691
And he acted like he genuinely
cared for Ariel.

09:49.758 --> 09:51.993
I mean, we can't lock her up
until she's 25.

09:52.061 --> 09:54.295
So forgive me if I take
some comfort in the fact

09:54.363 --> 09:55.797
that she's found someone
who's nice.

09:55.864 --> 09:58.099
No, you're right,
I take it back. Lucky us.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.868
Our daughter's going to be
impregnated by a boy who's nice.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.405
All's right with the world.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.640
You don't know that.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.075
Yeah, I do.

10:07.142 --> 10:09.310
No, you don't
know that.

10:09.378 --> 10:10.979
First of all,
you've told me yourself,

10:11.046 --> 10:12.380
your intuition
about these things

10:12.448 --> 10:14.849
is notoriously unreliable
when it comes to loved ones.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.318
And second of all,
if Ariel really--

10:17.386 --> 10:21.089
if she was like--
irresponsible in that way,

10:21.156 --> 10:23.257
do you think that
she'd allow herself

10:23.325 --> 10:24.792
to miss out on college?

10:24.860 --> 10:26.361
Come on, not Ariel.

10:26.428 --> 10:27.795
Not the Ariel I know.

10:27.863 --> 10:29.764
Not if she was pregnant
with octuplets.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.733
So how about we forget
about the kid

10:31.800 --> 10:34.168
that we don't know,
and consider the
kid that we do.

10:34.236 --> 10:36.571
'Cause I got to tell you,
that this dream you had,

10:36.638 --> 10:38.206
it strikes me less
as a cautionary tale

10:38.273 --> 10:39.807
about premarital sex,
and more like

10:39.875 --> 10:41.142
the anxious fears
of a mother

10:41.210 --> 10:43.077
who's a little bit nervous
about the first boy

10:43.145 --> 10:44.479
who's ever come
home for dinner.

10:44.546 --> 10:49.250
(phone ringing)

10:49.318 --> 10:50.551
Hello.

10:50.619 --> 10:52.220
Sorry to call so late,

10:52.287 --> 10:54.756
but you know that composite
you worked up this afternoon?

10:54.823 --> 10:57.325
I had someone compare it
to our missing persons database.

10:57.393 --> 10:58.993
I think
we may have found a match.

10:59.061 --> 11:01.496
Name's Angelo Filipelli.

11:01.563 --> 11:03.164
Small-time thief,
bunch of petty crimes.

11:03.232 --> 11:06.300
But, uh, I got to tell you,
if Earl Sanderson really did

11:06.368 --> 11:08.136
bury this guy in concrete,
I highly doubt

11:08.203 --> 11:09.971
that's the reason
he got shot last night.

11:10.039 --> 11:12.073
W-Why do you say that?

11:12.141 --> 11:16.511
Because Angelo Filipelli
was reported missing in 1992,

11:16.578 --> 11:18.579
and no one's seen the guy since.

11:49.344 --> 11:51.345
(gasps)

11:55.627 --> 11:56.960
You're sure it was Casey?

11:56.928 --> 11:58.262
Yeah, I'm positive.

11:58.329 --> 12:01.932
He was carrying a gun and he was
stalking that-that petty thief,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.868
that dead man that I saw
yesterday-- Earl Sanderson.

12:04.936 --> 12:05.869
I don't know.

12:05.937 --> 12:08.272
That kid that we
met yesterday,

12:08.339 --> 12:10.908
he doesn't seem like the
kind to stalk anybody.

12:10.975 --> 12:12.175
Much less use a gun.

12:12.543 --> 12:14.211
Well, I'm telling you,
it was him.

12:14.278 --> 12:15.378
You didn't happen to notice

12:15.446 --> 12:17.080
what kind of shoes
he was wearing, did you?

12:17.148 --> 12:18.648
No. Why?

12:18.716 --> 12:19.983
Well, because the police found

12:20.051 --> 12:22.352
a sneaker print outside
Sanderson's window.

12:22.420 --> 12:23.787
Well, don't worry about it.

12:23.854 --> 12:26.590
I'll ask Casey myself
when we question him today.

12:26.657 --> 12:28.425
When you what?

12:30.461 --> 12:31.528
When we
question him.

12:31.596 --> 12:33.396
A man was murdered, Joe,
shot in cold blood.

12:33.464 --> 12:34.431
Yeah, I know that.

12:34.498 --> 12:35.699
But this kid
that we're talking about,

12:35.766 --> 12:37.901
this is, this is
our daughter's friend.

12:37.969 --> 12:39.569
And truthfully,
the only reason that you think

12:39.637 --> 12:41.838
that he might be involved
is 'cause you had a dream.

12:41.906 --> 12:43.273
Isn't that reason enough?

12:43.341 --> 12:44.441
Of course
it's reason enough.

12:44.508 --> 12:45.976
I'm just asking you to consider

12:46.043 --> 12:48.411
the possible repercussions of
what you're about to do here.

12:48.479 --> 12:49.412
Like what?

12:49.480 --> 12:50.547
You're going to
question this boy,

12:50.615 --> 12:51.881
he's going to go to Ariel,

12:51.949 --> 12:53.783
and she's going to be
really upset with you.

12:53.851 --> 12:55.118
So what would you have me do?

12:55.186 --> 12:56.386
I don't know, wait!

12:56.454 --> 12:57.520
Wait for what?

12:57.588 --> 12:58.588
More evidence.

12:58.656 --> 12:59.789
So at least you're sure.

12:59.857 --> 13:00.724
I am sure.

13:00.791 --> 13:01.992
Well, I'm not.

13:02.059 --> 13:03.994
Because this is our daughter's
first boyfriend.

13:04.061 --> 13:07.430
And don't you think that maybe,
just maybe, this is about that?

13:07.498 --> 13:09.399
You don't have
to be Freud to suspect

13:09.467 --> 13:11.434
that there's something else
going on here.

13:11.502 --> 13:14.704
That maybe you're finding
reasons not to like this boy

13:14.772 --> 13:17.140
by inserting him into the case
you're working on.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.608
You really think that?

13:18.676 --> 13:19.909
I don't know what I think.

13:19.977 --> 13:20.910
Just tread lightly, okay?

13:20.978 --> 13:22.812
Tread lightly.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.080
Well, I'm dropping off the girls

13:24.148 --> 13:25.815
and I'm meeting Lee
at the high school.

13:25.883 --> 13:27.083
To the high school?!

13:27.151 --> 13:29.119
<i>CASEY:
I'm sorry.</i>

13:29.186 --> 13:31.221
I don't know what to tell you.

13:31.289 --> 13:33.690
I've never seen this man before.

13:33.758 --> 13:34.891
Did something happen to him?

13:34.959 --> 13:37.360
Someone, uh, shot him.

13:37.428 --> 13:38.828
He's dead.

13:38.896 --> 13:40.363
You sure you're okay
talking to us?

13:40.431 --> 13:42.799
We'd be happy to wait for
your parents or a lawyer.

13:42.867 --> 13:45.068
Yeah, there's no reason to wait.

13:45.136 --> 13:48.738
I don't know anything
about any of this.

13:48.806 --> 13:51.975
And, I mean, I know Mrs. Dubois.

13:52.043 --> 13:54.110
I just really want
to get back to class.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.148
Just give us a second, will you?

14:00.151 --> 14:02.352
Uh, okay, I get that
you know this kid.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.521
I get that, uh, you had
a dream, but, uh...

14:04.588 --> 14:06.222
But what?
Question him.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.524
About what?

14:07.591 --> 14:09.693
He's a good, clean-cut
kid from the suburbs.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.995
The dead man's a
small-time, lowlife punk.

14:12.063 --> 14:14.464
Absent your dream,
this makes no sense.

14:14.532 --> 14:17.667
Just... question him.

14:18.703 --> 14:20.704
(sighs)

14:25.109 --> 14:26.943
All right.

14:30.781 --> 14:32.449
So, Casey...

14:34.452 --> 14:36.953
I need you to tell me where
you were two nights ago, say

14:37.021 --> 14:39.923
between 10:00 at night,
2:00 in the morning.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.393
At home.

14:43.461 --> 14:47.564
Doing homework
and then sleeping.

14:47.631 --> 14:49.899
Look, am I in
some kind of trouble?

14:49.967 --> 14:52.335
SCANLON:
Can anybody confirm that?

14:52.403 --> 14:54.637
That, uh, you were home, I mean.

14:54.705 --> 14:56.406
I don't know.

14:56.474 --> 14:58.742
My dad's out of town
on business, and my mom

14:58.809 --> 15:01.444
went out to dinner
with friends that night.

15:01.512 --> 15:03.480
I went to sleep
before she got home.

15:03.547 --> 15:07.250
I suppose if you ask her
what time she got home

15:07.318 --> 15:10.153
and if she checked
to see if I was asleep.

15:10.221 --> 15:12.021
But other than that...

15:22.099 --> 15:25.034
Uh, you mind if I ask
what size shoe you wear?

15:25.102 --> 15:26.436
Ten.

15:26.504 --> 15:27.637
What does that matter?

15:27.705 --> 15:29.272
ALLISON:
The police found
a shoe print outside

15:29.340 --> 15:32.742
Earl Sanderson's--
the man who was shot.

15:32.810 --> 15:35.245
It was the same brand and the
same size that you're wearing.

15:35.312 --> 15:37.213
Wait a second.

15:37.281 --> 15:39.949
Everyone has these.

15:40.017 --> 15:43.019
Look, Mrs. Dubois,
you'd tell me

15:43.087 --> 15:45.755
if I was in some kind
of trouble, right?

15:45.823 --> 15:46.790
You'd help me?

15:46.857 --> 15:48.258
(door opens)

15:49.994 --> 15:51.661
Mom.

15:51.729 --> 15:52.996
Casey, wait outside.

15:53.063 --> 15:54.297
Mom, this is...

15:54.365 --> 15:55.398
I know who they are.

15:55.466 --> 15:57.000
Just pick up your things
and wait outside.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.435
ALLISON,
Mrs. Covington,

15:58.502 --> 15:59.936
my name is Allison Dubois.

16:00.004 --> 16:00.970
My daughter and your son
are friends.

16:01.038 --> 16:01.971
I know who you are.

16:02.039 --> 16:03.139
I know who both
of you are.

16:03.207 --> 16:04.140
The principal
called me.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.676
Why are you questioning my son?

16:06.744 --> 16:07.677
What's this about?

16:07.745 --> 16:09.012
We received a tip

16:09.079 --> 16:10.914
about a young man
matching your son's description

16:10.981 --> 16:12.982
at the scene of a homicide
two nights ago.

16:14.685 --> 16:15.852
This is a joke.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.220
My son?

16:17.288 --> 16:19.722
Mrs. Covington, no one's
accusing your son of anything.

16:19.790 --> 16:22.091
We're just trying to ascertain
if he knew this man.

16:22.159 --> 16:24.594
You come marching
into a public school,

16:24.662 --> 16:28.131
question a 17-year-old
without notifying his parents,

16:28.199 --> 16:30.767
without giving him the chance
to consult an attorney?

16:30.835 --> 16:32.669
Honestly, we offered
to let him call you.

16:32.736 --> 16:35.939
Excuse me,
Detective Whoever You Are,

16:36.006 --> 16:38.374
this is still America, isn't it?

16:38.442 --> 16:40.109
This boy is
an honor student.

16:40.177 --> 16:41.444
This boy is
a national scholar.

16:41.512 --> 16:44.113
And you ambush him at school

16:44.181 --> 16:46.783
to talk to him
about a homicide?

16:46.851 --> 16:48.351
Like some kind of thug?

16:48.419 --> 16:50.520
What is the name
of your supervisor?

16:50.588 --> 16:52.789
You can just call
the chief of police, ma'am.

16:52.857 --> 16:55.258
I think I will.

16:55.326 --> 16:57.627
And I think I'll call
my attorney, too.

16:57.695 --> 17:00.530
And if you still have
any questions for me or my son,

17:00.598 --> 17:03.800
you should just feel free
to run them by him first.

17:03.868 --> 17:07.637
Oh, and I'd appreciate it
if, in the future, you,

17:07.704 --> 17:11.406
your daughter, your entire
family stay away from my son.

17:11.474 --> 17:13.076
Just stay away.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.012
(door slams)

17:17.080 --> 17:19.449
Well, that was productive.

17:19.517 --> 17:21.550
Lee, he's hiding something.

17:21.618 --> 17:23.118
Didn't you see
the look on his face

17:23.186 --> 17:24.521
when you asked him
about his shoes?

17:24.588 --> 17:26.189
Allison, it's not like
it's a particularly

17:26.257 --> 17:28.691
expensive or
unique shoe.

17:28.759 --> 17:30.693
And size ten is like
saying I'm a righty.

17:30.761 --> 17:32.762
He was there, Lee, I saw him.

17:34.598 --> 17:36.499
Hey, wait, Lee, wait.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.567
She's still out there.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.208
Lee, look.

17:45.276 --> 17:47.577
SCANLON:
What am I looking at?

17:47.645 --> 17:49.646
Hmm?

17:52.249 --> 17:53.683
No, nothing.

17:53.751 --> 17:54.817
I'm sorry.

17:54.885 --> 17:55.885
(doorbell rings)

17:58.923 --> 18:00.857
I'm coming, I'm coming!

18:00.925 --> 18:01.958
Mr. Dubois?

18:02.026 --> 18:04.260
My name is Lloyd Darby.

18:04.328 --> 18:05.295
You recognize me?

18:05.362 --> 18:07.330
I'm betting
that you do.

18:08.365 --> 18:12.068
A lot of people
recognize me these days.

18:12.136 --> 18:14.470
I take it you're aware
that a young lady

18:14.538 --> 18:16.639
who lives in this house
has been filming me,

18:16.707 --> 18:18.374
putting the videos
on the Internet?

18:18.442 --> 18:19.842
Yeah, that's my daughter.

18:19.910 --> 18:23.146
Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

18:23.213 --> 18:25.248
I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Darby.

18:25.316 --> 18:28.685
Um, I can assure you,
the video is down, it's gone.

18:28.752 --> 18:30.954
My wife and I just found out
about this last night.

18:31.021 --> 18:32.455
And if there's anything
that we can do,

18:32.523 --> 18:34.591
if there's any way that we can
make this up to you...

18:34.658 --> 18:36.726
You know how many people
have watched that video?

18:36.794 --> 18:41.164
My second cousin in
Maine sent me the link.

18:41.231 --> 18:44.701
People point at me
in the supermarket.

18:44.768 --> 18:47.470
They laugh at me
when I'm in my car.

18:47.538 --> 18:51.007
Does your daughter have
some reason to dislike me?

18:51.075 --> 18:52.308
No, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

18:52.376 --> 18:53.476
I mean, I know

18:53.544 --> 18:56.179
I'm not the most
graceful man in the world.

18:56.246 --> 18:58.348
I know I'm carrying
a few extra pounds.

18:58.415 --> 19:00.817
But I don't think I deserve
to be reminded of that

19:00.884 --> 19:02.251
every time I leave my house.

19:02.319 --> 19:04.120
No, absolutely not.

19:04.188 --> 19:07.123
I need you to understand,

19:07.191 --> 19:10.627
if I ever find myself
on the Internet again,

19:10.694 --> 19:14.897
if your daughter
ever violates my privacy,

19:14.965 --> 19:17.367
I'll have no choice
but to sue you.

19:17.434 --> 19:19.369
I've already been in touch
with a lawyer.

19:19.436 --> 19:22.105
Please don't
give me a reason

19:22.172 --> 19:24.641
to have to contact him again.

19:33.751 --> 19:37.020
It just keeps going
right to voice mail.

19:37.087 --> 19:39.489
Hey, Ashton Kutcher,
tomorrow's garbage day.

19:39.556 --> 19:40.590
Cans are already out front.

19:40.658 --> 19:42.425
(Bridgette sighs)

19:44.261 --> 19:45.495
All right, that's it.

19:45.562 --> 19:47.130
I'm calling the police.
Ariel's still not home.

19:47.197 --> 19:48.197
It's after 8:30.

19:48.265 --> 19:49.365
No, no, no, no.

19:49.433 --> 19:50.733
Don't do that.
She's fine, really.

19:50.801 --> 19:54.303
She's just mad, like
you said she would be.

19:54.371 --> 19:55.471
It's my fault.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.206
I-I dealt with this
whole thing so stupidly.

19:57.274 --> 19:59.909
I should have spoken with her,
let her know what was going on.

19:59.977 --> 20:02.345
Be that as it may, she's still
not home, it's a school night.

20:02.413 --> 20:03.346
I'm worried.

20:03.414 --> 20:04.914
Ariel is home.

20:04.982 --> 20:07.483
She's outside in a car
with her boyfriend.

20:07.551 --> 20:08.718
(door opens)

20:08.786 --> 20:09.852
Ariel!

20:09.920 --> 20:12.321
(door slams)

20:12.389 --> 20:13.389
(knocking)

20:13.457 --> 20:14.524
ALLISON:
Ariel.

20:14.591 --> 20:16.592
Go away.

20:19.496 --> 20:20.963
Ariel.

20:21.031 --> 20:24.300
I only came home because I knew
that Daddy would be worried.

20:24.368 --> 20:28.304
Bridgette and Marie
would be worried.

20:28.372 --> 20:30.440
Okay.

20:30.507 --> 20:32.875
The thing is, I...

20:32.943 --> 20:35.778
I wanted to tell you,
I did something wrong.

20:37.781 --> 20:39.649
You sure did.

20:39.717 --> 20:41.584
No, I mean...

20:41.652 --> 20:43.319
honey, I should have
spoken with you first,

20:43.387 --> 20:45.955
let you know what was going
on-- that I had this dream,

20:46.023 --> 20:47.790
that I had to question
your friend...

20:47.858 --> 20:50.993
No, see, you didn't
have to do that.

20:51.061 --> 20:53.796
Okay, you could have
come to me and asked me

20:53.864 --> 20:55.798
if he was capable
of being involved

20:55.866 --> 20:59.102
with something like that,
of knowing anyone like that.

20:59.169 --> 21:01.404
I saw him following
that man that died.

21:01.472 --> 21:02.872
I saw him
carrying a gun.

21:02.940 --> 21:04.507
You didn't see it.

21:04.575 --> 21:07.176
Okay, you dreamt it,
and you're wrong.

21:07.244 --> 21:09.312
You don't know him, I do.

21:09.379 --> 21:10.379
Well, that's
another thing.

21:10.447 --> 21:11.481
I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

21:11.548 --> 21:13.249
What?!
He had a gun, Ariel!

21:13.317 --> 21:14.917
In your dream!

21:14.985 --> 21:17.887
Okay, which isn't real!

21:17.955 --> 21:19.655
And you can't make me
not see him.

21:19.723 --> 21:20.923
Don't test me.

21:20.991 --> 21:22.925
No, no, no!
Where are you going with that?!

21:22.993 --> 21:24.494
You can have
this back

21:24.561 --> 21:27.864
as soon as you agree
to take my calls.

21:28.899 --> 21:30.700
(door closes)

21:49.119 --> 21:51.320
(car door opens and closes)

21:51.388 --> 21:52.822
WOMAN:
Casey.

21:52.890 --> 21:55.057
(footsteps approaching)

21:56.226 --> 21:58.661
Why didn't you
come home tonight?

22:01.165 --> 22:03.766
Your father and I
have been worried sick.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.135
He went looking for you
at school.

22:07.337 --> 22:09.405
Look at me.

22:09.473 --> 22:13.176
You promised me you
wouldn't come here anymore.

22:14.545 --> 22:16.479
They knew I was lying.

22:16.547 --> 22:19.215
Ariel's mom, that detective.

22:19.283 --> 22:22.084
They could tell I knew
the man in the picture.

22:22.152 --> 22:24.487
But you weren't... lying.

22:24.555 --> 22:27.757
<i>You don't know that man;
you only think you do.</i>

22:27.825 --> 22:30.326
Don't tell me what I know.

22:31.495 --> 22:32.795
That man,

22:32.863 --> 22:34.664
Earl Sanderson,

22:34.731 --> 22:35.965
he kidnapped me,

22:36.033 --> 22:39.502
he threw my in a hole,
he covered me in concrete.

22:39.570 --> 22:41.904
Right here.

22:41.972 --> 22:44.006
Right here 17 years ago.

22:44.074 --> 22:45.274
Casey,

22:45.342 --> 22:47.276
listen to me.

22:47.344 --> 22:49.278
This thing you keep
telling yourself,

22:49.346 --> 22:50.746
it's not real.

22:50.814 --> 22:52.782
You're not
Angelo Filipelli.

22:52.850 --> 22:56.719
I know you don't
believe me.

22:58.188 --> 23:01.190
But I died, Mom.

23:01.258 --> 23:04.827
I died here 17 years ago.

23:04.895 --> 23:08.164
I died the day I was born.

23:08.232 --> 23:09.899
(soft gasp)

23:26.767 --> 23:28.601
What is that?

23:28.669 --> 23:30.603
It's Angelo Filipelli.

23:30.671 --> 23:32.538
It's you.

23:32.606 --> 23:34.540
<i>Those are X rays</i>

23:34.608 --> 23:36.409
generated by
ground radar.

23:36.477 --> 23:38.611
I convinced the
police to use them

23:38.679 --> 23:41.814
outside the old Sheridan's
Pharmacy in Glendale.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.816
I was certain we
would find nothing.

23:43.884 --> 23:46.085
(chuckles)

23:46.153 --> 23:48.688
And then there it was.

23:48.755 --> 23:51.257
A skeleton.

23:51.325 --> 23:53.392
<i>Someone is
buried in there.</i>

23:53.460 --> 23:55.528
What difference does it make?

23:55.596 --> 23:57.063
Why do you care?

23:57.131 --> 24:00.533
(sighs):
Well... I think that you did
something really horrible,

24:00.601 --> 24:04.003
something you may have to pay
for for the rest of your life,

24:04.071 --> 24:05.805
and I want to help you.

24:07.107 --> 24:10.109
You really think I killed
that guy, don't you?

24:13.347 --> 24:16.482
I've always known...

24:16.550 --> 24:21.787
as long as I can remember,
my name is not Kyle Covington.

24:21.855 --> 24:24.090
It's Angelo Filipelli.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.925
And I don't know why.

24:25.993 --> 24:27.660
Okay? It just is.

24:27.728 --> 24:29.929
I know all about his life.

24:29.997 --> 24:32.665
I can do the things he could do.

24:32.733 --> 24:35.034
When I was five,
I could fix a car.

24:35.102 --> 24:37.103
Okay? I just could.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.371
Check it out.

24:38.438 --> 24:40.673
Angelo Filipelli was a mechanic.

24:40.741 --> 24:44.310
I know about
how he died, too.

24:44.378 --> 24:48.080
He was killed...

24:48.148 --> 24:50.516
<i>I was killed...</i>

24:50.584 --> 24:54.820
by a tall guy with
a limp and a ponytail.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.456
(sighs)

24:57.524 --> 25:00.860
This doesn't surprise me at all.

25:00.928 --> 25:02.528
(sighs)

25:02.596 --> 25:05.264
I go there all the time.

25:05.332 --> 25:07.667
I just stare at it.

25:08.835 --> 25:11.704
One time, I'm there, and...

25:11.772 --> 25:14.907
this man shows up.

25:14.975 --> 25:16.909
I knew who he was.

25:16.977 --> 25:20.279
He was still wearing
that stupid ponytail.

25:20.347 --> 25:23.049
I followed him
back to his apartment.

25:23.116 --> 25:24.951
You know, I kept wondering

25:25.018 --> 25:27.954
if there was something
I was supposed to do.

25:28.021 --> 25:30.122
Kill him, maybe?

25:31.291 --> 25:34.227
But I'm no killer.

25:34.294 --> 25:38.197
Okay? And Angelo Filipelli,
he's no killer.

25:38.265 --> 25:40.733
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

25:40.801 --> 25:43.169
Mrs. Dubois,
you have to believe me.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.470
(knocking)

25:45.973 --> 25:48.574
Does she know
about all this?

25:48.642 --> 25:50.076
(quietly):
No.

25:50.143 --> 25:52.345
Look, if it's okay,
we have a class together,

25:52.412 --> 25:55.281
and I just don't want her
to get in any more trouble.

25:55.349 --> 25:56.616
No, it's okay.

25:56.683 --> 25:58.384
Tell her I said so.

26:11.932 --> 26:14.166
So, what'd she want?

26:15.736 --> 26:17.670
You know what she wanted.

26:17.738 --> 26:20.373
They think
I killed that guy.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.008
(sighs)

26:22.075 --> 26:23.442
I hate this.

26:23.510 --> 26:25.144
Okay? I'm not a murderer.

26:25.212 --> 26:26.679
I didn't shoot
anybody, okay?

26:26.747 --> 26:27.847
I couldn't have.

26:27.914 --> 26:29.181
I don't have a gun.

26:29.249 --> 26:30.783
I-I've never
even seen a gun.

26:30.851 --> 26:32.685
I know.

26:33.687 --> 26:36.722
Look, maybe your
parents were right.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.058
Maybe we should
leave each other
alone for a while.

26:39.126 --> 26:40.559
(exhales)

26:40.627 --> 26:42.361
Casey...

26:42.429 --> 26:46.065
Casey, I'm not my mother.

26:46.133 --> 26:48.501
Okay? I know you...

26:48.568 --> 26:52.104
and I know that you
could never hurt anybody.

27:23.403 --> 27:25.905
Thanks for
believing in me.

27:25.972 --> 27:27.740
We should get going.

27:27.808 --> 27:30.343
Class started a
few minutes ago.

27:31.578 --> 27:33.279
You coming?

27:33.347 --> 27:34.880
(phone rings in distance)

27:34.948 --> 27:36.615
Joseph Dubois?

27:36.683 --> 27:39.251
Yeah, that's me.
Can I help you?

27:39.319 --> 27:41.320
You've been served.

27:45.759 --> 27:47.193
(aerosol spritzing)

27:47.260 --> 27:50.596
(hornets buzzing, man yelling)

27:50.664 --> 27:51.931
No! No!

27:51.998 --> 27:53.933
(buzzing, yelling continue)

27:54.000 --> 27:55.434
Hey.

27:55.502 --> 27:57.370
(buzzing, yelling continue)

27:59.206 --> 28:02.575
(buzzing, yelling continue)

28:04.010 --> 28:06.145
(turns video off)
You defied us?

28:06.213 --> 28:07.913
I wasn't going to,

28:07.981 --> 28:10.850
but then I had this dream,
and...

28:10.917 --> 28:13.352
everything that
happened in the video

28:13.420 --> 28:15.621
pretty much happened
in the dream first.

28:15.689 --> 28:20.192
Except that in the dream,
I saw myself taping everything,

28:20.227 --> 28:22.728
even though you told me not to.

28:22.796 --> 28:24.864
And in the dream,
after the hornets

28:24.931 --> 28:26.999
chased the guy away,

28:27.067 --> 28:30.603
he came back and thanked me
for putting it all on tape

28:30.670 --> 28:32.571
<i>and for getting it
on the Internet.</i>

28:32.639 --> 28:33.739
Wow, really?

28:33.807 --> 28:35.574
Now, you expect us
to believe that?

28:35.642 --> 28:37.943
It's the truth!
No, it's not the
truth, Bridgette,

28:38.011 --> 28:40.146
because the man that
you taped, Mr. Darby,

28:40.213 --> 28:42.782
is so upset with it
that he's suing us

28:42.849 --> 28:44.183
for defamation
of character.

28:44.251 --> 28:45.184
Is that bad?

28:45.252 --> 28:47.052
It could end up
costing us a lot

28:47.120 --> 28:49.221
of time and a lot
of money, darling.

28:49.289 --> 28:50.823
Well, the one bright
spot in all this,

28:50.891 --> 28:52.825
if there is a bright
spot, is that you only

28:52.893 --> 28:54.560
taped him in public places.

28:54.628 --> 28:58.564
So technically, his privacy
wasn't violated, I think.

28:58.632 --> 29:01.567
So we may not be in any trouble?

29:01.635 --> 29:05.104
No, no, no, no, this is
gonna cost us something
before this is all over.

29:05.172 --> 29:08.407
None of it changes the
fact that we told you
not to do something,

29:08.475 --> 29:09.608
and you did it anyway.

29:09.676 --> 29:11.577
ARIEL:
Mom?

29:11.645 --> 29:13.412
Ariel.

29:14.748 --> 29:17.049
I-I need to talk to you.

29:22.255 --> 29:24.056
(door opens)

29:24.124 --> 29:26.292
She doing better?

29:26.359 --> 29:27.860
(sighs):
Not really.

29:27.928 --> 29:32.064
I... got her to stop crying
for a little while, at least.

29:32.132 --> 29:35.634
Then she'd go over it
again, and she'd get...

29:35.702 --> 29:38.904
sad that somebody she
cared about lied to her.

29:38.972 --> 29:41.073
Maybe even
killed a man.

29:41.141 --> 29:43.008
No.

29:43.076 --> 29:45.811
I'm still hoping not.

29:45.879 --> 29:49.181
I got an e-mail back
from the lawyer.

29:49.249 --> 29:50.549
It's like I thought--

29:50.617 --> 29:52.818
he says the guy
really has no case.

29:52.886 --> 29:54.086
Well, that's good.

29:54.154 --> 29:56.489
Yeah, but it still doesn't
get us out of having

29:56.556 --> 29:58.824
to go to court, and
it still doesn't get us

29:58.892 --> 30:01.660
out of paying the lawyers
and missing work.

30:01.728 --> 30:04.597
So he suggested that we
should offer a settlement.

30:04.664 --> 30:06.565
We're gonna meet with
Darby's lawyers tomorrow

30:06.633 --> 30:08.701
and see if we can
work something out.

30:08.768 --> 30:10.836
How much "working out"
are we talking here?

30:10.904 --> 30:12.972
He suggested
we offer $5,000

30:13.039 --> 30:15.574
and then go up to
$7,500 if we have to.

30:15.642 --> 30:18.777
Doesn't this guy know
we just bought a new car?

30:18.845 --> 30:21.480
(cell phone playing ringtones)

30:25.552 --> 30:27.520
Hey, Lee.
What's going on?

30:27.587 --> 30:29.822
Based on your tip,
we were able to get a warrant

30:29.890 --> 30:31.390
to search
the Covington's residence.

30:31.458 --> 30:34.293
Found the .38 revolver
right where you said it'd be.

30:34.361 --> 30:35.728
Ballistics says it's a match

30:35.795 --> 30:39.732
for the weapon that
killed Earl Sanderson.

30:39.799 --> 30:41.433
(sighs):
And, uh..

30:41.501 --> 30:42.735
we've just
filed charges.

30:42.802 --> 30:44.236
Thought you'd
like to know.

30:45.605 --> 30:47.973
(quietly):
Thanks, Lee.

30:48.041 --> 30:49.542
(beep)

30:53.313 --> 30:55.414
They just found the gun.

30:55.482 --> 30:57.416
Casey's gun.

30:57.484 --> 31:00.219
It was the one that was
used to kill Sanderson.

31:00.287 --> 31:01.554
Should we tell Ariel?

31:01.621 --> 31:03.589
No.

31:03.657 --> 31:06.625
She's been through so much.

31:06.693 --> 31:08.827
We'll tell her
in the morning.

31:08.895 --> 31:11.897
(long sigh)

31:14.935 --> 31:16.268
(sighs)

31:31.318 --> 31:33.619
You look good, Nance.

31:35.789 --> 31:38.090
Angelo.

31:38.158 --> 31:40.092
You look good, too.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.827
Sit down.

31:48.234 --> 31:51.770
The guy you're with must be
taking good care of you.

31:51.838 --> 31:55.107
You have to stop calling me.

31:55.175 --> 31:56.742
(chuckles)

31:57.777 --> 31:59.445
Says who?

32:01.381 --> 32:05.050
Angelo, that girl
you're trying to charm...

32:05.118 --> 32:07.252
she doesn't live here anymore.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.456
I haven't touched drugs
for two years.

32:12.726 --> 32:14.893
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other.

32:14.961 --> 32:17.296
Maybe, maybe not.

32:17.364 --> 32:19.832
That baby you're
carrying around...

32:19.899 --> 32:22.434
we both know that it's
not your husband's.

32:22.502 --> 32:26.005
You can't expect me
to just disappear.

32:26.072 --> 32:29.108
That night was a mistake.

32:29.175 --> 32:30.909
One mistake.

32:30.977 --> 32:33.746
And I am not
gonna make another one.

32:33.813 --> 32:37.750
I got a nice life for myself,
I got a nice life for my baby.

32:37.817 --> 32:40.819
Nice things. Nice people.

32:40.887 --> 32:42.888
And I am not going
to mess that up.

32:44.958 --> 32:47.760
Look, you're not going to come
out of this empty-handed.

32:47.827 --> 32:51.830
I can pay you some money,
but there is no way

32:51.898 --> 32:54.500
you are going to be
a part of my son's life.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.969
It's a boy?

32:57.037 --> 32:58.671
Lunch is on me.

32:58.738 --> 33:00.039
Don't call again.

33:02.676 --> 33:05.377
What are you going
to name him?

33:05.445 --> 33:07.713
Kyle.

33:07.781 --> 33:10.716
It's Michael's
father's name.

33:21.828 --> 33:23.829
(sighs)

33:24.898 --> 33:26.465
He won't take the money.

33:26.533 --> 33:28.534
He won't go away.

33:31.237 --> 33:33.338
You need
to take care of it, Earl.

33:33.406 --> 33:35.407
Tonight.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.607
You waiting to see your son?

33:53.675 --> 33:56.777
How dare you
sit next to me,

33:56.845 --> 33:59.980
pretending to give a damn
about me or my son.

34:00.048 --> 34:01.716
You're the reason
he's in jail.

34:01.783 --> 34:04.452
Now, kindly
leave me in peace.

34:04.519 --> 34:06.087
Okay, well...

34:06.154 --> 34:08.621
Casey won't be
back there long.

34:08.690 --> 34:11.158
At this point, we're pretty
certain that he didn't do it.

34:13.195 --> 34:16.864
Are you serious?

34:16.931 --> 34:19.667
We know who the
guilty party is.

34:19.735 --> 34:23.337
We're just waiting to see if
we can get her to confess.

34:23.405 --> 34:26.940
You know, it seems
that 17 years ago,

34:27.007 --> 34:29.677
the killer hired a man
named Earl Sanderson

34:29.745 --> 34:32.580
to murder a man named
Angelo Filipelli.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.815
Angelo Filipelli
was her child's father,

34:35.884 --> 34:38.085
but she didn't want
her husband to find out.

34:38.152 --> 34:40.521
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

34:40.589 --> 34:42.123
Oh, I think you do.

34:42.190 --> 34:43.524
(chuckles)

34:43.592 --> 34:45.525
I spent the whole morning
going through bank records.

34:45.594 --> 34:47.728
Yours. Earl Sanderson's.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.429
Hey, you want to hear
a funny coincidence?

34:49.498 --> 34:51.931
Starting in 1992,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.702
around the time Angelo
Filipelli went missing,

34:54.770 --> 34:57.071
Earl Sanderson started
living off of cash

34:57.139 --> 34:59.373
from a mysterious
benefactor.

34:59.441 --> 35:02.309
The amounts of his deposits

35:02.377 --> 35:04.512
and the amounts of
your withdrawals

35:04.579 --> 35:06.046
match up pretty nicely.

35:06.114 --> 35:09.283
Another funny thing?

35:09.351 --> 35:12.052
The size of
Sanderson's deposits

35:12.120 --> 35:14.922
got bigger and bigger
year after year.

35:14.990 --> 35:17.925
So did the size of
your withdrawals.

35:17.993 --> 35:21.262
Till one day,
Sanderson turns up dead

35:21.329 --> 35:24.932
and you stop
making withdrawals.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.333
So, what?

35:26.401 --> 35:28.269
Was he asking for more money

35:28.336 --> 35:29.737
than you could hide
from your husband?

35:29.805 --> 35:32.673
How does this work?

35:32.741 --> 35:33.774
They know I'm here.

35:33.842 --> 35:34.975
Are they going
to call my name?

35:35.043 --> 35:36.143
Casey told the police

35:36.211 --> 35:38.579
that the gun used
was a family weapon,

35:38.647 --> 35:40.614
although when we
questioned your husband,

35:40.682 --> 35:42.416
he claimed he didn't
know anything about it.

35:42.484 --> 35:44.452
It was your
gun, wasn't it?

35:46.988 --> 35:49.256
(sighs)

35:49.324 --> 35:50.724
(chuckles)

35:50.792 --> 35:52.059
What? You find
this amusing?

35:52.127 --> 35:55.796
I find it strange.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.765
You're making all
kinds of accusations.

35:57.833 --> 36:00.768
We're in a police station,
but no one is arresting me.

36:00.836 --> 36:02.136
(chuckles)

36:02.204 --> 36:03.504
You know what
I find strange?

36:03.572 --> 36:05.840
You love your son.

36:05.907 --> 36:08.442
You were even willing
to murder someone

36:08.510 --> 36:11.011
to make sure that he
had a better life.

36:11.112 --> 36:14.014
Now you're willing
to let him go to jail

36:14.082 --> 36:16.383
for a crime he
didn't commit?

36:18.253 --> 36:20.821
Let me tell you
something about my son.

36:22.357 --> 36:25.426
Casey is a very disturbed boy.

36:25.494 --> 36:27.695
Ever since he was a child,

36:27.762 --> 36:30.297
he's believed he's someone
other than who he is.

36:30.365 --> 36:33.400
I can't tell you
how many doctors he's seen.

36:33.468 --> 36:36.337
How much testing,
consulting...

36:36.404 --> 36:39.106
Perhaps now,
the court will see to it

36:39.174 --> 36:41.909
that he gets
the treatment he needs.

36:41.977 --> 36:43.143
(chuckles)

36:43.211 --> 36:45.379
Wow. You are really
putting a lot of faith

36:45.447 --> 36:47.281
in an insanity defense.

36:47.349 --> 36:49.683
You seem to be suggesting

36:49.751 --> 36:52.152
that I have some choice
in this matter,

36:52.220 --> 36:53.621
that there are options here.

36:53.688 --> 36:56.156
There are no options here.

36:56.224 --> 36:57.491
Think about it.

36:57.559 --> 36:59.426
Aren't there?

36:59.494 --> 37:01.228
Oh, I think there are.

37:01.296 --> 37:04.932
Right now, your son
is back there getting
a simple DNA test,

37:05.000 --> 37:09.236
and I think we both know
that that test is going to show

37:09.304 --> 37:11.438
that Casey is not
your husband's son.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.109
I don't want to
do this to Casey.

37:15.176 --> 37:16.477
I don't want to do
this to your husband.

37:16.545 --> 37:18.779
But I will do it
if I have to.

37:18.847 --> 37:20.347
And then what?

37:20.415 --> 37:22.449
What? Everything that
you've worked for--

37:22.517 --> 37:24.518
everything that
you've killed for--

37:24.586 --> 37:26.954
it all goes away.

37:27.022 --> 37:29.423
Along with your family.

37:29.491 --> 37:32.726
Along with anyone
who loves you.

37:34.296 --> 37:36.630
Or...

37:37.799 --> 37:41.669
I will make sure that
that DNA is disposed of,

37:41.736 --> 37:44.538
that it is never tested.

37:44.606 --> 37:46.640
At least, in this way,

37:46.708 --> 37:49.109
Casey will still
have a father.

37:49.177 --> 37:51.245
Still have a family.

37:51.313 --> 37:54.048
He will still
have a future.

37:56.651 --> 37:58.752
And...

37:58.820 --> 38:01.221
if I were to confess?

38:04.559 --> 38:06.760
Maybe offer, um...

38:06.828 --> 38:08.829
a different motive?

38:12.867 --> 38:16.503
Well, I will
keep your secret.

38:17.939 --> 38:19.940
I promise.

38:21.643 --> 38:23.644
(elevator bell dings)

38:33.622 --> 38:34.722
Mr. Dubois?

38:34.789 --> 38:37.157
Yeah. Mr. Darby. Hi.

38:37.225 --> 38:39.560
(both chuckling)

38:39.628 --> 38:42.963
Uh, my attorney, actually,
he isn't here yet, so...

38:43.031 --> 38:44.465
I just, I--

38:44.532 --> 38:46.433
You know, I'd just like
to say again how sorry I am

38:46.501 --> 38:50.771
about all this and how-how
terrible my whole family feels.

38:50.839 --> 38:52.306
It's all right, Mr. Dubois.
No. No.

38:52.374 --> 38:53.941
No, it's not.
Yes. Yes it is.

38:54.009 --> 38:55.476
In fact,

38:55.543 --> 38:57.745
um, maybe you should
call your attorney.

38:57.812 --> 39:00.381
I actually don't think we're
going to be needing attorneys.

39:00.448 --> 39:02.416
Uh, excuse me?

39:02.484 --> 39:03.751
(laughing)

39:03.818 --> 39:05.519
It's the funniest thing.

39:05.587 --> 39:08.689
Uh, Anna and I

39:08.757 --> 39:11.458
worked together
at a water park

39:11.526 --> 39:14.061
in Minnesota
the summer after college.

39:14.129 --> 39:16.730
Lost touch.
Years go by.

39:16.798 --> 39:19.199
I always thought
about her.

39:19.267 --> 39:21.035
Turns out,

39:21.102 --> 39:23.604
she always
thought about me.

39:23.672 --> 39:26.740
Then she saw your
daughter's video.

39:29.277 --> 39:30.511
Oh.

39:30.578 --> 39:31.945
Okay.
(both laughing)

39:32.013 --> 39:33.981
Great. Well,
who'd have thunk it?

39:34.049 --> 39:35.282
(laughing):
I know.

39:36.518 --> 39:39.353
Oh, my lawyer
thinks I'm crazy.

39:39.421 --> 39:42.156
He told me I should
have taken your money.

39:42.223 --> 39:44.258
Squeezed you for a
little more, even.

39:44.325 --> 39:46.193
But I don't know,
Mr. Dubois.

39:46.261 --> 39:48.629
I mean, we are
neighbors, and...

39:50.331 --> 39:52.066
(elevator bell dings)

39:53.735 --> 39:58.505
today just doesn't feel
like a day for attorneys.

40:07.382 --> 40:10.217
(chuckles, clears throat)

40:11.352 --> 40:13.921
(both laughing)

40:15.423 --> 40:16.590
(elevator bell dings)

40:20.929 --> 40:23.530
How is she?

40:25.934 --> 40:29.636
She's... amazing.

40:33.341 --> 40:35.843
She wants to see him again.

40:35.910 --> 40:37.745
I told her it was okay.

40:37.812 --> 40:40.180
But he lied to her.

40:40.248 --> 40:41.648
I know.

40:41.716 --> 40:43.717
She knows.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.388
He took his mother's gun.
He followed that man.

40:48.456 --> 40:51.859
He stood outside his window
in his canvas high tops,

40:51.926 --> 40:53.927
but at the end
of the day,

40:53.995 --> 40:55.362
he couldn't do it.

40:55.430 --> 40:57.698
He didn't have it in him.

40:57.766 --> 40:59.867
(sighs heavily)

40:59.934 --> 41:03.437
She just keeps saying how
confused he is, how sad.

41:03.505 --> 41:05.639
His mother's in prison.

41:05.707 --> 41:08.008
That he can't make
sense of it all.

41:08.076 --> 41:10.911
How he knows
the things he knows,

41:12.347 --> 41:15.115
how he knew where
Angelo Filipelli was buried.

41:17.819 --> 41:20.020
But here's what I know.

41:20.088 --> 41:23.590
I know he's a good kid.

41:25.693 --> 41:29.630
And the rest of it,
I can't explain.

41:35.470 --> 41:38.071
So you really can see me?

41:40.909 --> 41:42.910
They told me you could.

41:45.079 --> 41:48.015
The way I heard it, kids
can only see people like me

41:48.082 --> 41:50.717
for a year, maybe
a year and a half.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.089
We got a lot to pack
into that time.

41:56.157 --> 41:58.425
But you have to be
patient with me.

42:00.662 --> 42:03.163
'Cause I'm new at this.

42:03.231 --> 42:05.232
Being a dad.

42:06.434 --> 42:07.935
Being dead.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.041
I'm gonna come see you
every night, okay?

42:17.378 --> 42:19.446
Every night
till you can't see me anymore.

42:22.617 --> 42:24.484
That's gonna be
our special time.

42:24.552 --> 42:27.321
I'm gonna tell you
all about my life.

42:27.388 --> 42:30.390
The good... and the bad.

42:32.026 --> 42:34.027
All of it.

42:35.296 --> 42:38.966
I'm gonna try
and teach you stuff, too.

42:39.033 --> 42:41.602
But first things first.

42:41.669 --> 42:44.671
We got to talk
about this name of yours.

42:44.739 --> 42:46.240
Your mom
and that guy she's with...

42:46.307 --> 42:47.474
(sniffles)

42:47.542 --> 42:50.644
I know they named you
something different.

42:50.712 --> 42:53.513
But when I'm around,

42:53.581 --> 42:55.916
I'm gonna call you the name
I would have given you.

42:57.719 --> 42:59.686
It's my granddad's name.

42:59.754 --> 43:01.388
(sniffles)

43:01.456 --> 43:03.457
My dad's name.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.927
Your dad's name.

43:08.463 --> 43:11.598
I'm gonna call
you Angelo.

43:11.666 --> 43:13.967
Angelo Filipelli.

43:14.035 --> 43:16.036
(gasps)

43:18.907 --> 43:20.841
