00:00.868 --> 00:03.071
* Hoo-hoo-hoo *

00:03.104 --> 00:05.239
* Leave it up to me

00:05.273 --> 00:06.240
* Hoo-hoo-hoo *

00:06.274 --> 00:10.178
It's a known disease *

00:10.211 --> 00:12.246
* Hoo-hoo-hoo *

00:12.280 --> 00:14.615
* Keep it in your fleece

00:14.648 --> 00:15.649
(bell ringing)

00:15.683 --> 00:20.154
*Don't worry
about the custom police, don't *

00:20.188 --> 00:24.058
* I'll tell you
just how good it can be *

00:24.092 --> 00:25.426
* This lazy summer...

00:25.459 --> 00:28.062
(seagulls squawking)

00:28.096 --> 00:30.064
MAN:
So these are some examples

00:30.098 --> 00:31.765
of what we might find
today in our catch.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.067
Pacific crab,

00:33.101 --> 00:34.702
sea anemones,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.537
a number of a variety
of starfish.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.839
We'll find sea urchins,

00:38.872 --> 00:42.543
as well as a host
of sardines and mackerel.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.479
Now, when I release
this net over here,

00:45.513 --> 00:48.682
I want you to try to identify
as many creatures as you can.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.251
Keep a list
in your notebooks there.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.254
So far, most of what we can
see here is kelp,

00:53.287 --> 00:55.389
which you're all familiar with
from the beach, right?

00:55.423 --> 00:56.824
Everybody's seen that?

00:56.857 --> 00:58.559
Good. So write down "kelp."

00:58.592 --> 01:00.728
* Hoo-hoo-hoo *

01:00.761 --> 01:03.063
* Leave it up to me...

01:05.333 --> 01:06.700
(gasping)

01:11.505 --> 01:13.741
Somebody call
the Harbor Patrol!

01:18.812 --> 01:22.583
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

01:22.616 --> 01:24.485
(helicopter flying overhead)

01:24.518 --> 01:26.320
WOMAN:
Hey, boys.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.789
How is it this guy
rates FBI attention?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.291
Well, he has the dumb luck
of getting himself

01:30.324 --> 01:31.459
scooped up out of the ocean.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.327
Crimes at sea
puts it on our desk.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.396
WOMAN: He wasn't
in the water long.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.431
16 to 24 hours--
I can't say for sure

01:37.465 --> 01:38.666
till I get him in the shop,

01:38.699 --> 01:41.169
but he was probably dead
before he went in.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.403
COLBY:
Think the bullet hole in

01:42.436 --> 01:43.737
his wetsuit had anything
to do with that?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.639
Actually, Granger, it's
the bullet hole in the diver

01:45.673 --> 01:47.275
- that really clinched it.
- Thank you.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.443
Glad to see those four years
of med school

01:49.477 --> 01:50.611
didn't go
to waste on you.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.545
Five.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.315
So where'd you find it?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.516
The boat was
dragging the bottom

01:55.549 --> 01:56.684
over several miles,
seeing what they could

01:56.717 --> 01:58.852
pull up for the kids.
Kids?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.355
Junior high class on
an oceanography field trip.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.224
That must have
gone over real well.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.825
(chuckles)

02:04.858 --> 02:07.161
And it's not a regular
wetsuit here, right?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.696
No, it's definitely commercial.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.698
He's an oil rig
diver or something?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.700
All right, check it out.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.836
"Morris Marine Salvage."

02:15.869 --> 02:17.771
COLBY: Salvage diver then, huh?
Makes a living

02:17.805 --> 02:19.807
pulling things up
off the bottom of the ocean,

02:19.840 --> 02:21.175
winds up somebody else's catch.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.752
Hey, Charlie.

02:31.785 --> 02:32.753
Hey.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.754
You headed
for school?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.489
No, actually.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.526
I'm headed to the FBI to drop
off some crime index work I did,

02:38.559 --> 02:39.793
but after that, yeah, I am.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.695
Ah, you're looking
for a match, huh?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.564
With you? You crazy?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.399
Said I'd never
do that again.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.836
Sit around watching you getting
bored with me all the time?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.338
Or condescending.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.705
Or bored and
condescending.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.873
Well...

02:52.906 --> 02:54.642
thought maybe
you were desperate.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.744
You know, seeing as your
usual chess partner Larry

02:56.777 --> 02:58.446
is currently
in low earth orbit.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.747
No, not at all.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.516
You know, Millie says she
has a pretty good game.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.419
Oh, really? Well, then,
I'll be sure to teach her

03:05.453 --> 03:07.288
some of my best condescending
looks. No.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.756
I mean, no coaching.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.624
She says she has
a pretty good game,

03:10.658 --> 03:11.859
you let her
bring her game.

03:11.892 --> 03:12.960
Dad, she's a mathematician.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.363
That gives her the same
analytical edge that I have.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.531
Yeah, I hadn't
thought about that.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.400
Yeah.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.869
Maybe I better think about
changing some of my strategy.

03:21.902 --> 03:25.273
Maybe you take this whole thing
a little too seriously.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.907
Charlie, it's chess.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.542
Need I say more?

03:35.816 --> 03:36.750
DON:
What's up?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.752
Hey. So you want to know
the dead guy's name?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.787
Yeah.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.821
Evan Koontz.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.457
He was a Navy diver
till '98.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.426
He's been working
a bunch of dive jobs since.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.261
And five months ago,
he landed

03:47.295 --> 03:48.429
Morris Marine Salvage,

03:48.462 --> 03:50.931
but he really should have
done a little more homework

03:50.964 --> 03:53.033
- on his employers.
- Why's that?

03:53.066 --> 03:56.837
Meet the Morris brothers,
Chris and Robert.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.439
Yeah, what are they into?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.441
Theft, assault-- but I'm
kind of getting the feeling

04:00.474 --> 04:03.644
all the marine salvage people
are not Boy Scouts.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.678
Right.

04:04.712 --> 04:05.613
I've been on the phone with

04:05.646 --> 04:07.815
a bunch of salvage companies
in the area.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.916
Turns out every
single dive team

04:08.949 --> 04:10.318
between here
and San Diego

04:10.351 --> 04:12.052
are out looking
for the same thing--

04:12.085 --> 04:13.421
the Cheetah.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.388
Yeah?

04:14.422 --> 04:17.458
A 60-foot Open Class
racing yacht went down

04:17.491 --> 04:18.726
a couple days ago.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.894
COLBY: At 40 miles out
in deep water.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.995
Think I read about this, right?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.431
They're in some
'round the world race?

04:23.464 --> 04:24.632
What, they still
can't find it?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.967
Yeah, they were headed for
Marina del Rey when she sank,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.936
and the skipper
went down with her.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.838
Charlie, are you
a closet yachtsman

04:30.871 --> 04:33.307
or just really up on the news?
Neither.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.843
Open Class is the term for the
cutting edge of racing yachts,

04:35.876 --> 04:37.845
and a ton of math
goes into designing them.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.482
A lot of it is based on my work
in computational fluid dynamics.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.384
COLBY:
Fluid dynamics being

04:43.417 --> 04:45.052
aerodynamics in the water?

04:45.085 --> 04:48.088
You can think of air
as a very thin liquid.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.591
Both air and water
stick to surfaces

04:50.624 --> 04:52.493
as they travel over them,
creating friction.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.595
And what we can do is create

04:54.628 --> 04:58.432
mathematically-optimized
designs that reduce friction,

04:58.466 --> 05:01.435
lowering the drag as air,
or in this case water,

05:01.469 --> 05:03.036
moves around the design.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.072
The lower the drag,
the faster the boat.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.708
How much you know about this
particular one? Not much.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.710
Designs are kept secret
before a race.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.545
What I can tell you
is that these boats

05:11.579 --> 05:13.714
can easily cost
$8 to $10 million.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.083
And a boat like the Cheetah,
even as a shipwreck,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.918
is still worth a couple million.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.019
COLBY:
That would explain why

05:19.052 --> 05:21.021
everybody's out looking for it.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.723
Yeah, I mean, as far as
maritime law's concerned,

05:22.756 --> 05:23.857
you find it, you own it.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.025
Basically, we got
a big treasure hunt.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.093
Somewhere out there,

05:26.126 --> 05:27.661
on the bottom
of the ocean,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.763
is a $2 million prize.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.874
(ship horn blowing)

05:40.908 --> 05:42.810
Excuse me.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.945
How you doing?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.714
We're with the FBI.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.949
Anyone from Morris
Salvage around?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.384
I haven't seen
anybody today, no.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.019
When was the last
time you saw them?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.887
I don't know.
Uh, that's their boat.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.523
It's been out
past couple of days.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.625
Must have come
back in last night,

05:57.658 --> 05:58.626
but I wasn't here, so...

05:58.659 --> 05:59.627
What's your name?
Jackson.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.861
Okay, Jackson,
thanks.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.795
Yeah.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.535
If this guy's right,
that means this barge was out

06:07.568 --> 06:09.603
the same time period
the diver was shot and dumped.

06:09.637 --> 06:13.040
You ever see Treasure
of the Sierra Madre?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.842
Guys are out
looking for treasure,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.109
they start getting greedy.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.848
Mix in a little alcohol,
maybe an argument erupts

06:20.881 --> 06:22.450
over how they're
going to split up

06:22.483 --> 06:23.851
the prize when they find it.
Yeah.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.787
Three guys sail out,
maybe only two make it back.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.724
Hey, Colby.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.792
Come here, check it out.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.732
Yeah, that's probably
not finger paint, huh?

06:38.766 --> 06:39.700
DON:
Maybe better call in

06:39.733 --> 06:41.602
and get a team out here.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.606
Hold on, I'll be back in a sec.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.443
Agent Warner.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.844
How you doing?

06:50.878 --> 06:51.979
What do you say, kid?

06:52.012 --> 06:54.715
What's going on?

06:54.748 --> 06:55.916
I got transferred.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.518
L.A.'s my new base.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.886
No way.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.154
Yeah, I've been... been here
about three weeks.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.793
You know, I just got
caught up in work.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.760
You know how that is.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.895
Yeah, definitely, sure.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.498
I caught wind of your case,

07:10.531 --> 07:11.765
gave me an excuse to see you.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.234
Oh, yeah? All right.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.770
I'm working a task force
looking at the marina

07:16.804 --> 07:18.105
as an entrance point for drugs.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.040
We've been seeing
supply boats come up

07:20.073 --> 07:21.709
from Mexico and making
drops in deep water.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.744
And local fishing charters
or salvage boats

07:23.777 --> 07:25.746
go out, make the pickup.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.248
Was hoping I can
tag along with you guys,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.551
see if there's any connection
between that and this.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.752
Yeah, sure.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.986
Tag away.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.121
All right.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.789
COLBY:
Hey, uh,

07:35.823 --> 07:36.857
ERT guys are on their way.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.891
How you doing, Agent Warner?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.660
Good to see you.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.162
Check out this picture
I found up in the wheelhouse.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.666
Cheetah.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.871
MAN:
Morris Salvage isn't part

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
of the official search
for the Cheetah,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.775
but that doesn't mean
they weren't out there looking.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.778
Situation like this,
salvagers descend like flies.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.080
Everybody's looking to grab
a piece of the rights to...

08:00.113 --> 08:01.181
whatever's down there.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.050
Well, that must be annoying.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.018
It's your yacht and everybody's
looking to cash in.

08:05.052 --> 08:08.689
Right now, the more boats
out there, the merrier.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.524
Gives us a better chance
of finding Reid.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.193
Reid Sarasin, your skipper?

08:13.226 --> 08:17.164
I was in radio contact with him
until he went down.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.901
Not a handful
of people in the world

08:20.934 --> 08:24.004
could sail on his level.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.841
You have any idea what caused
your yacht to sink, then?

08:27.875 --> 08:29.543
Probably design flaw.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.311
We fared well, most of the race,

08:31.344 --> 08:34.114
but then, three days
out of Honolulu,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.816
the keel starts to separate,

08:35.849 --> 08:38.586
and she starts
taking on water.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.720
So why didn't they
turn back then?

08:39.753 --> 08:43.991
The seas got rougher,
we realized how serious it was,

08:44.024 --> 08:46.226
and Reid gave the order
to abandon ship.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
And how many
in his crew?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.063
Five, including Reid.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.800
We were able to contact
another yacht.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.002
She doubled back,
picked up four of our guys,

08:55.035 --> 08:57.237
but Reid wouldn't go.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.273
He thought, with four
less bodies on board,

09:00.307 --> 09:01.942
the Cheetah could make it.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.645
But he didn't.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.779
Seven minutes later,

09:05.813 --> 09:08.816
we lost radio contact.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.884
Then her locator beacon
went dead.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.889
I can replace
the Cheetah, you know?

09:15.923 --> 09:18.792
Can always build another boat.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.862
But I'm not sure how I'm going
to replace Reid Sarasin.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.003
Charlie. Charlie.
Sorry.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.371
Quick question for you.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.374
How good is your dad at chess?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.676
He's good.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.710
He'll give you a real game.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.811
Uh-oh.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.913
I'm afraid I might have

09:39.947 --> 09:42.182
misrepresented my abilities
just a little bit.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.884
- You don't play chess?
- No, I do.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.886
I mean, I can. It's a game.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.220
I'm good at games.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.658
There's, like, what,
there's queen and the crown?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.292
- Oh, boy.
- Doesn't matter.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.028
Alan will probably enjoy being
able to teach me something.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.631
What's this?

09:57.665 --> 09:58.732
What, now you're
building a boat

09:58.766 --> 10:00.233
on university time?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.636
These are design plans
for a racing yacht

10:02.670 --> 10:04.237
that came apart and sank.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.839
Oh.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.074
And you're looking
for the flaws.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.242
I am, but I haven't found
any yet.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.645
As far as I can tell,
the design is solid.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.646
(writing on chalkboard)

10:12.680 --> 10:15.382
With the allotted load
of crew and supplies,

10:15.415 --> 10:19.052
well, I see no reason
why the keel failed.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.254
You know, Charlie, I have
some sailing experience myself.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.824
Well, no, no.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.726
For real. Not like
my chess experience.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.593
Real experience.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.728
I bet you're gonna
tell me about it.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.096
Yes, I am.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.199
I took a three-month
sabbatical from MIT,

10:32.232 --> 10:34.802
and I spent it navigating
the South Pacific

10:34.835 --> 10:36.103
with a friend
from grad school.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.771
Now, I know
it sounds like

10:37.805 --> 10:39.940
I'm in danger of not
having a point here,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.374
but I do, and it's this:

10:41.408 --> 10:43.811
Out at sea, all bets are off.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.047
You encounter forces that you
could never, ever anticipate.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.717
Granted, some of those forces
have to do with, you know,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.052
being confined
to a very small space

10:52.085 --> 10:54.788
with someone who you thought
you knew but clearly didn't,

10:54.822 --> 10:56.023
someone who
is so enamored

10:56.056 --> 10:57.357
with the sound
of their own voice

10:57.390 --> 10:58.726
that they could just
talk endlessly

10:58.759 --> 10:59.927
for hours and hours

10:59.960 --> 11:01.361
without ever needing
to even have

11:01.394 --> 11:02.229
to take a breath. Millie.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.697
I mean, you don't know
what it's like.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.698
You said you had a point.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.166
And I do.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.836
Professor, it's this:

11:08.869 --> 11:09.803
The ocean has to have exerted

11:09.837 --> 11:11.839
tremendous physical pressure
on this boat.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.907
I mean, have you
accounted for

11:13.941 --> 11:16.209
tensile stress,
for compressive creep,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.344
for material fatigue here?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.678
Well, I ran calculations...

11:20.781 --> 11:24.718
...to evaluate probabilities
for material failures,

11:24.752 --> 11:25.853
to see if the design

11:25.886 --> 11:28.421
would withstand
ocean conditions.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.191
And I'll tell you,
I cannot find a single flaw.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.862
Well, then why'd
the yacht sink?

11:34.895 --> 11:38.198
MEGAN: Colby, you're gonna want
to hear this, too.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.967
That was the lab.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.334
They just finished
the preliminary,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.103
analysis on the
blood you found

11:43.136 --> 11:45.005
- on the Morris barge.
- Uh-huh.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.108
They isolated
three distinct samples.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.943
The first one belongs
to our deceased diver,

11:49.977 --> 11:51.812
Koontz, and the other two...

11:51.845 --> 11:53.814
- What, the brothers?
- Yeah.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.982
The blood-types are consistent.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.316
So the Morris
brothers become

11:56.349 --> 11:58.451
potential victims now,
not suspects?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.887
Which means we shift

11:59.920 --> 12:00.754
our focus where?

12:00.788 --> 12:02.489
MEGAN: Other salvage companies
maybe?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.892
Somebody who was trying
to stop the Morris barge

12:04.925 --> 12:06.894
- from finding the yacht?
- LIZ: Or it could be related

12:06.927 --> 12:08.762
to one of the drug operations
I was telling Don about.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.064
- DON: Right.
- Either they're involved

12:11.098 --> 12:12.933
or maybe the search for
the yacht took them too close

12:12.966 --> 12:14.201
to something they weren't
supposed to see.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.836
It's safe to say the guy
was shot on the barge.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.937
Right? It's just a question

12:16.970 --> 12:18.138
of where it was
at the time.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.807
If we knew where
the barge was, we would

12:19.840 --> 12:20.707
know what other ships

12:20.740 --> 12:22.342
were in the area,
who else had access.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.513
CHARLIE:
I got to tell you,

12:26.546 --> 12:29.482
from a mathematical
standpoint, the designs

12:29.516 --> 12:30.483
for this yacht are
absolutely amazing.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.252
I mean, it almost has me
thinking about getting

12:32.285 --> 12:34.187
back into my fluid
dynamics work again.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.388
Ooh, you mean

12:35.422 --> 12:38.125
abandon your cognitive
emergence theory?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.526
Is that what you're talking
about?

12:39.559 --> 12:40.727
I said "almost".

12:40.760 --> 12:41.995
Oh, good, because I remember the
damage that some of those,

12:42.029 --> 12:45.398
uh, fluid dynamics experiments
did on the pond in the backyard.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.300
All the koi lived.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.535
(door opens)
Hey.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.503
- Donny. Dinner's over,
- Hey, boys.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.539
but we have some
leftovers, you interested?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.908
Oh, no. I'm good, I ate. Thanks.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.309
Wouldn't be, uh, dinner

12:56.343 --> 12:58.011
with Agent Liz Warner,

12:58.045 --> 12:59.379
would it?

12:59.412 --> 13:00.914
I heard she was back.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.115
I might've mentioned

13:02.149 --> 13:02.950
something to him.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.351
ALAN: Seems to me that
when you two

13:04.384 --> 13:05.418
worked together you were

13:05.452 --> 13:06.519
kind of interested
in each other.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.922
So?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.523
Well?

13:10.557 --> 13:11.859
What are you gonna do?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.827
I don't know. We'll see.

13:13.861 --> 13:14.962
I mean, I'm pretty busy, right?

13:14.995 --> 13:17.564
And, uh,
and she's busy.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.299
We'll see.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.135
Okay.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.172
So, anything new
on the yacht

13:25.205 --> 13:26.006
or the diver's murder?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.474
Nah.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.477
The problem is, it's like, uh,
we got a mobile crime scene.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.279
- You mean the barge?
- Yeah, I mean,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.147
as many as, what, three murders,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.116
and, uh, I mean,
it could've happened anywhere.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.119
Well, we may be able to figure
out where it happened.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.421
All right, well, tell me what
you need; I'll make it happen.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.957
CHARLIE: The question we're
asking is quite simple:

13:43.991 --> 13:46.093
how far did this barge go

13:46.126 --> 13:48.996
while it was out, and how
can we retrace its path?

13:49.029 --> 13:51.464
Oh, come on, Charlie.
I'm calling your bluff here.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.100
No, you got to let
him run with this.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.402
He's fun to watch
when he gets going.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.304
See, the key is finding

13:57.337 --> 13:59.139
possible data sources--
believe it or not,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.541
there's a lot more
clues out here

14:01.574 --> 14:03.310
than you probably even
realize-- for instance,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.912
how much fuel was consumed?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.279
How many engine
hours were logged?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.981
Did they record
any sonar readings?

14:08.015 --> 14:10.918
How far was this
anchor chain run out,

14:10.951 --> 14:13.086
and was there evidence
of a particular

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
algae bloom on the chain?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.656
Ah, I'm having
a bad algebra flashback.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.591
"If a salvage
barge was headed west

14:18.625 --> 14:19.960
"at six knots in a headwind

14:19.993 --> 14:21.261
- of eight knots..."
- Oh, it's not

14:21.294 --> 14:22.195
even that difficult.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.497
Look, every piece of data
is a constraint.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.166
Okay?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.601
And the path of the boat
must obey every constraint.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.637
So the set
of possible paths

14:30.670 --> 14:33.941
is pared down
with each new measurement.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.576
See, now I'm gonna make a list
of possible data sources.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.011
You two start collecting.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.013
COLBY: Okay, wait, hang on a
second, Charlie.

14:40.047 --> 14:40.914
I actually have
information

14:40.948 --> 14:43.951
on fuel consumption
and engine hours.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.552
Hit me with it.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.654
68 gallons and 16 hours.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.457
You sure about that?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.625
That's what it says
in the report, Charlie.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.528
I mean, I can double- check it,
but that's what it says.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.531
What? Charlie, you can't already
know where the barge went.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.567
No, but...

15:00.600 --> 15:03.636
I can tell you
where it didn't go.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.505
You see, the Cheetah

15:05.538 --> 15:07.140
went down here.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.276
Approximately 40 miles out,
and according

15:09.309 --> 15:11.611
to these engine
and fuel hours data...

15:11.644 --> 15:13.947
Well, I can tell
you right now

15:13.981 --> 15:16.383
that this barge traveled

15:16.416 --> 15:19.552
a maximum of 20 miles.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.388
Round trip.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.589
Well, that means
it was never more than

15:22.622 --> 15:23.823
- ten miles out.
- Which means

15:23.856 --> 15:26.093
they were nowhere near where
the Cheetah went down.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.228
- You know it.
- All right,

15:28.261 --> 15:30.097
but all of the assumptions
that we're making

15:30.130 --> 15:31.331
about motive and cause

15:31.364 --> 15:33.000
are all attributed
to finding that boat.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.235
Well, then,
your assumptions are wrong.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.538
So if they weren't looking
for the racing yacht,

15:38.571 --> 15:40.107
then what were they looking for?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.554
Excuse me, Charles,

15:54.587 --> 15:56.523
I have the admissions
list for you.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.691
Still working
on the racing yacht,Professor

15:58.725 --> 16:01.028
Uh, no, actually.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.429
The case has taken a turn

16:02.462 --> 16:03.530
in a different direction.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.598
Oh, really.
What is it now?

16:05.632 --> 16:06.699
Now, I'm trying to retrace

16:06.733 --> 16:09.002
the path of a marine
salvage barge.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.503
Why would you want to do that?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.572
The FBI suspects there
was a murder on board.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.308
Really? And if I can tell them
where the barge went,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.677
then hopefully figure out
who else was in the area.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.646
Oh, you mean the killer.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.613
Hmm?
Yeah.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.781
Still, a barge... ugh.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.316
Doesn't quite have the snap

16:23.350 --> 16:25.085
and sex appeal
of a racing yacht,

16:25.118 --> 16:26.719
- does it?
- No, not exactly.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.156
- You're reading up on chess?
- Yes.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.590
Okay, good, so...

16:30.623 --> 16:32.559
Lasker or Jankowski? Which one's

16:32.592 --> 16:34.494
- gonna give me a better shot?
- Millie, this isn't

16:34.527 --> 16:35.495
Come on.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.296
the kind of thing that you can
learn overnight.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.365
I'm a quick study.
I'm very smart.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.299
(knock at door)

16:39.332 --> 16:39.732
The game of chess
is like a sword fight.

16:39.766 --> 16:40.667
Anyway, I can...

16:40.700 --> 16:42.135
Professor Eppes.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.536
Oh, men in suits.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.471
If you don't mind,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.206
we need to speak
to Professor Eppes alone.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.475
Uh, I don't mind
at all, Charlie.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.311
I'll just read both of them...
tonight.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.113
Gentlemen.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.284
(door closes)
Perfect timing, gentlemen.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.651
What's this about?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.687
We're with the
National Security Agency.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.689
We have a situation, we're
hoping you can help us out.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.691
I'm always happy to help
you guys. I am working

17:04.724 --> 17:06.593
on something for the FBI
right now.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.460
We know what you're

17:07.494 --> 17:08.761
involved in, Professor.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.597
We also know that you have
an interest

17:10.630 --> 17:12.332
in a missing racing yacht.
The Cheetah.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.067
That's why we've
come to you.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.603
We want you to help us find it.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.638
Within hours of the time
the Cheetah went down,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.407
we had two search
vessels in the area.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.075
We've worked
around the clock,

17:22.109 --> 17:24.577
sonar mapping
every inch of the bottom.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.280
And are you sure you're looking
in the spot that she went down?

17:27.314 --> 17:28.581
The boat's locator
beacon gave precise

17:28.615 --> 17:30.617
GPS coordinates until
the moment it went under.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.719
Still, despite our best
efforts, we've found nothing.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.654
May... may I inquire

17:34.687 --> 17:38.291
why the NSA is so interested
in finding this yacht?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.362
CHARLIE:
N-S-A, Never Say Anything.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.597
I get it.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.742
You haven't been able to find

17:55.775 --> 17:57.377
this boat because you've
been looking

17:57.410 --> 17:58.711
in the wrong place.
Your search pattern,

17:58.745 --> 17:59.646
probably assumes

17:59.679 --> 18:02.715
that the Cheetah
sank something...

18:02.749 --> 18:05.185
something like this.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.586
When in reality...

18:14.161 --> 18:16.329
In reality... the Cheetah

18:16.363 --> 18:18.498
probably sank something
a little more...

18:21.401 --> 18:22.602
...like that.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.403
It glides forward.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.738
That's correct.
It glides forward.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.640
Now, a boat like the Cheetah,

18:27.674 --> 18:29.476
a boat with this
sophisticated a design,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.378
it practically
flies under water,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.513
traveling laterally
four, maybe even

18:33.546 --> 18:35.148
five feet for every
foot that it falls.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.583
Now knowing what I know
about the hull,

18:36.616 --> 18:38.618
given the depth of the water,

18:38.651 --> 18:39.852
I should be able
to determine

18:39.886 --> 18:41.421
with a fair amount
of accuracy

18:41.454 --> 18:44.424
just how far she traveled
before hitting the bottom.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.559
And then you guys
can refocus your search.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.296
- How long will it take you?
- I'll get on it right away.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.531
Uh, oh, and
Professor...

18:51.564 --> 18:54.367
This is a matter of
national security.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.669
It's need-to-know only,
so not a word to anyone.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.206
That includes the FBI.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.879
If the Morris barge
was never near

19:06.913 --> 19:09.582
where the yacht went down, then
they weren't after the yacht.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.717
Maybe they're involved

19:10.750 --> 19:12.852
in one of the drug operations
you were talking about?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.354
Yeah, but drug
runners usually

19:14.387 --> 19:15.822
stay further out
in international waters.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.690
But I don't think
we can rule it out.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.925
I just spoke
to the E.R.T. lab.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.661
Turns out the other two traces
of blood we found definitely

19:21.694 --> 19:24.364
belong to Chris
and Robert Morris.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.565
How big a leap would it be

19:25.598 --> 19:26.733
to assume they're dead,
same as their diver?

19:26.766 --> 19:27.967
COLBY:
Yeah, I mean, that would explain

19:28.000 --> 19:29.802
why we can't find them.
And if their killer

19:29.836 --> 19:31.571
dumped the bodies out
in the open ocean,

19:31.604 --> 19:33.640
there's no telling how far
they could've drifted by now.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.376
Maybe not. Can I see
that coroner's report?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.446
There were impressions
on the diver's ankles.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.948
Here, let's put this
up on the screen.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.816
Report says the
impressions are

19:43.850 --> 19:44.851
consistent with having been

19:44.884 --> 19:46.986
- caused by a rope.
- And not

19:47.019 --> 19:48.921
- the fishing net?
- LIZ: More like something

19:48.955 --> 19:50.790
was tied around his ankles.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.426
A weight probably.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.494
So whoever threw
him in the ocean

19:54.527 --> 19:56.529
probably anchored him down,
and for some reason

19:56.563 --> 20:00.367
his rope became free
and he just drifted,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.269
and ended up in the fishing net.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.102
Okay, so if that's true,

20:03.135 --> 20:04.304
then the Morris brothers
could still

20:04.337 --> 20:06.606
be anchored to the bottom
right where they were dropped.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.608
All right,
so we need to talk to Charlie.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.577
He can tell us where that barge
went when it was out,

20:10.610 --> 20:12.279
we got a good idea where
to look for the bodies.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.484
DON:
Charlie?

20:17.517 --> 20:18.651
Hey. What's going on?
Hey.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.719
Why don't you
answer your phone?

20:19.752 --> 20:21.821
I'm sorry.
I've been busy working.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.590
Oh, no, no, that's all right.
What, are you making progress?

20:23.623 --> 20:24.624
Here's the thing.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.426
I had to back-burner

20:26.459 --> 20:29.696
the, um, salvage barge thing
for a while.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.730
What are you talking about?

20:30.763 --> 20:31.964
Something else came up.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.933
Like what?

20:33.966 --> 20:36.369
I can't talk about it.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.704
Look, I think I got
two bodies down there

20:37.737 --> 20:38.771
on the bottom of the ocean.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.707
I don't know how long
they're going to stay put.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.476
You told me you were going to
figure out where that barge was.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.845
I understand.
I'll get on it as soon as I can.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.013
What do you mean
"as soon as you can"?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.581
Sorry.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.650
Well, that's not good
enough. "Sorry."

20:51.818 --> 20:53.653
Wh-What's going on?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.588
DON:
I don't know. You tell me.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.924
Hey. Hey.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.726
I'm in a no-win
situation.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.429
You know, he wants me to do
something, I can't right now.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.630
Why not?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.432
Because I'm doing
something else.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.966
All right?
Something I can't talk about.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.701
All right, relax.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.537
I'm not gonna ask.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.340
It's your choice
what to work on, and, uh...

21:13.373 --> 21:14.774
What's that supposed to mean?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.042
Well, it doesn't mean anything
more than what it means.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.944
You know what? It's...

21:17.977 --> 21:19.812
it's moot now anyway,
so just forget it.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.515
I-I just... I'm pretty much done
with what I'm doing.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.750
I'm just hungry.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.751
You know what, I'll stay.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.354
I'll stay and just do
what he wants me to do.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.894
(siren wailing in distance)

21:34.927 --> 21:36.829
Liz.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.500
Hey.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.369
What's going on?

21:45.805 --> 21:51.678
Last time, with us, I
was just passing through.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.480
Now I'm assigned here...

21:54.614 --> 21:57.417
...and...

21:57.450 --> 21:58.751
What? And what?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.553
Come on.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.921
It's complicated now.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.956
Yeah? Why's that?

22:06.593 --> 22:08.628
People will find out.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.096
So what?
So what?

22:10.129 --> 22:11.831
Yeah.
This is the bureau.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.566
It matters.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.468
Lots of agents are together.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.542
Where does your prosecutor
girlfriend fit into all this?

22:23.676 --> 22:24.977
She doesn't.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.081
CHARLIE:
Here. I'm done.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.750
Here's everything you need.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.919
Uh, actually, pal,
it's a little late.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.654
You don't want it now?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.055
No, no, sorry, I want
it. Look, Charlie,

22:36.088 --> 22:37.824
I want it; it's just
we can't get a boat

22:37.857 --> 22:39.592
out there till
morning, that's all.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.060
You were able to map
out the barge's path?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.762
Sort of.
I laid out a large grid.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.597
I mean, they'll have to check
it, but there's a better

22:44.631 --> 22:45.898
than an 83% chance

22:45.932 --> 22:47.667
that it covers
the Morris barge's operations.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.469
It's just
as I figured.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.838
They never left
the shallow water.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.106
MAN (over radio): Search Team
One completing the sweep

22:54.140 --> 22:55.575
of Grid Four.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.844
All right, well, GPS
coordinates put us

22:57.877 --> 22:59.912
right on the edge
of Abalone Cove.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.548
Charlie, we're going
to be coming around

23:01.581 --> 23:03.816
to the port side now
and beginning another pass.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.152
Okay, uh, copy that.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.055
Charlie, you said last night
there was an 83% chance

23:09.088 --> 23:11.023
that the Morris barge
was actually working

23:11.057 --> 23:12.091
within your search grid, right?

23:12.124 --> 23:13.225
That's right.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.995
Okay, well, there's still
a 17% chance they weren't.

23:16.028 --> 23:16.863
Wow, Liz, I didn't realize

23:16.896 --> 23:18.798
you were such
a glass-half-empty type.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.800
You know, 83% is still
a very high probability.

23:20.833 --> 23:21.801
Whoa.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.202
Go back.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.671
What was that?

23:24.704 --> 23:25.772
Hey, did you guys
see that?

23:25.805 --> 23:26.873
Uh, yeah, Charlie.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.575
Sonar mapping's
picking it up, too.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.510
Let me steer the camera
back around.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.944
Uh, I think it was back
this way a little bit.

23:31.978 --> 23:32.311
He'll get it.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.650
It's a body.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.619
Confirming a body.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.820
Sonar mapping's picking up
two of them.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.622
COLBY:
Chris and Robert Morris.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.990
I never doubted you, Charlie.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.625
Wait a minute.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.927
Sonar's reading something else
down there.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.962
Is that another body?

23:49.996 --> 23:51.731
Negative, this is much bigger.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.599
Looks like a vessel.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.434
All right,
can you get a video on it?

23:57.136 --> 23:59.005
It's the Cheetah.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.973
No, it can't be.
I've done all the calculations.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.575
It shouldn't be
anywhere near here.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.711
It shouldn't be, but it is.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.788
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

24:15.822 --> 24:17.256
CHARLIE:
None of this makes sense.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.692
All the available pieces
of data we have

24:19.726 --> 24:20.993
indicate that this yacht
went down

24:21.027 --> 24:22.194
40 miles out to sea.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.796
So how do you explain it
showing up

24:23.830 --> 24:25.832
so close to shore?

24:25.865 --> 24:26.833
We have
no idea.

24:26.866 --> 24:27.834
The Morris
brothers--

24:27.867 --> 24:29.101
they knew exactly where to look.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.704
What do you make of this?

24:31.738 --> 24:32.872
Morris Marine Salvage.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.006
Lift bags.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.175
They're used to raise
a sunken ship

24:36.208 --> 24:38.611
up to the surface.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.847
They'd already
brought her up.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.115
Why would somebody bring up
a $2 million prize

24:43.149 --> 24:44.684
and then throw it back?

24:46.753 --> 24:48.287
Who's the
agent in charge?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.488
It's Agent Eppes;
he's right there.

24:49.522 --> 24:52.925
Professor Eppes, I suppose
you think you're pretty clever.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.027
I'm sorry,
I'm not sure what you mean.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.095
You intentionally sent us
in the wrong direction

24:56.128 --> 24:57.296
so you could help
your brother find this yacht.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.600
No, no, no, I know it looks
like that, but believe me...

25:00.633 --> 25:02.635
You'll be lucky if you don't
lose your security clearance.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.936
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.739
Agent Cordero, Agent Graves,
I did nothing wrong.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.240
- What's going on here?
- You Eppes?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.441
Yeah.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.309
You're going to look worse
than your brother in all this.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.011
- And where are you guys from?
- NSA.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.149
GRAVES:
Do you have any idea

25:17.183 --> 25:18.250
how many taxpayer dollars
you wasted

25:18.284 --> 25:19.552
sending us in
the wrong direction?

25:19.586 --> 25:20.620
Back off already.
He doesn't know.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.155
I mean, how many times do
you want him to say it?

25:23.189 --> 25:24.657
We weren't looking
for the yacht.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.726
We, we were tracing the
path of a salvage barge...

25:26.759 --> 25:28.595
And you just happened
to find her. What luck.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.629
I'm going to go now.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.697
- No, you're not.
- Yes, you are.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.566
- Go ahead, it's fine.
- Good-bye.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.035
Look, guys.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.137
Clearly, we thought we were
working on different cases.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.939
Obviously, we're not,
so why don't we cut

25:39.972 --> 25:43.142
all the interagency crap and try
to figure out what's going on?

25:43.175 --> 25:45.211
Would you please tell me, what
is the NSA's interest in this?

25:48.748 --> 25:51.784
Aw, come on, please,
give me a break.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.787
Okay. NSA has been tracking

25:54.821 --> 25:57.089
an arms dealer
named Hashim Aziz.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.692
He's Pakistani, terrorist ties.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.693
He's on every
agency's watch list.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.029
DON: What, you think he's
connected to this?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.698
Aziz recently transferred
a large sum of money

26:05.732 --> 26:06.733
to Reid Sarasin.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.800
The skipper?

26:07.834 --> 26:09.736
CORDERO: The reason for the
payment is unknown.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.703
Best guess right now?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.305
That yacht was smuggling
something for Aziz.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.775
All right, so now I understand
why someone would pull it up

26:15.808 --> 26:17.009
a-and throw it back.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.611
They got what they wanted.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.880
The thing is:
we don't know what it was.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.651
Right.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.153
All of our search efforts for
the Cheetah have been focused

26:27.186 --> 26:30.657
right in this area here,
and that's only for one reason.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.024
Because that's
where the locator beacon

26:32.058 --> 26:33.159
stopped transmitting.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.394
Right, and the assumption was
it stopped transmitting

26:35.427 --> 26:36.663
because the boat went
underwater.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.697
But there are
other reasons

26:37.730 --> 26:39.198
the beacon might
have quit, right?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.701
Say you're the skipper,
Reid Sarasin, right?

26:41.734 --> 26:42.835
You're the last
man on the boat,

26:42.869 --> 26:45.371
you're taking on water,
and you're smuggling something.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.707
You're going to try
and get to shallow water

26:47.740 --> 26:49.375
as fast as possible,
'cause that's the only way

26:49.408 --> 26:51.377
you can recover whatever
it is you're smuggling.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.146
And you don't want anybody
to know where the boat winds up.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.649
Once my crew's gone,
I turn off my homing beacon,

26:56.683 --> 26:58.685
aim my yacht
for the closest shoreline.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.020
Right, it explains
why the boat wound up

27:01.053 --> 27:04.090
so close in, and it explains
how the Morris brothers knew

27:04.123 --> 27:06.092
where it was-- because
Sarasin told them.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.661
Which means
he didn't drown at sea.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.262
He's still alive.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.701
No good deed
goes unpunished, right?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.769
Hey, come on, look, don't
worry about those NSA guys.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.437
You know what I do feel
pretty bad about

27:18.470 --> 27:20.006
is putting your stuff
on the back burner.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.741
You know, I was
so obsessed with that boat

27:21.774 --> 27:23.843
that when they gave me
the chance to work on it,

27:23.876 --> 27:24.811
I just jumped.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.412
Yeah, well,
maybe you should feel bad then.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.715
No, no, I'm kidding.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.182
I'm kidding, buddy. Listen.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.851
They told me,
actually, they think

27:31.884 --> 27:33.285
the Cheet was
smuggling something.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.721
- Smuggling?
- Yeah.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.455
Don, that makes perfect sense.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.724
Why? You mean you knew?

27:37.757 --> 27:38.590
No.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.092
But I was looking for a flaw

27:40.126 --> 27:41.227
in the boat's design,

27:41.260 --> 27:44.130
and the hull must have failed
because it was carrying

27:44.163 --> 27:46.733
an extra load, extra
weight it wasn't designed

27:46.766 --> 27:49.101
to handle.
What were they smuggling?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.070
They were in 16 different
ports all over the world.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.205
Right? So, I mean,
if they did pick up anything

27:53.239 --> 27:54.707
it could've been
loaded on anywhere.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.275
Not exactly.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.409
Well, how do you know?

27:57.443 --> 27:59.078
I was studying the
boat's performance.

27:59.111 --> 28:03.282
Its pace slowed slightly
after a stop in Singapore.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.751
They-they took
on extra weight?

28:04.784 --> 28:06.185
Yeah, matter of fact,
you know, it wouldn't

28:06.218 --> 28:07.720
be too difficult
to calculate

28:07.754 --> 28:09.922
exactly how much extra
weight they took on.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.257
Yeah? All right, come on.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.258
- Back in?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.292
Are those guys still here?

28:13.325 --> 28:14.293
Don't worry
about them.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.294
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.495
Come here. Listen.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.931
Listen, whatever the, the
Cheetah was smuggling,

28:18.965 --> 28:20.166
apparently it picked
up in Singapore.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.100
How do you know that?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.735
Because Charlie says
it was moving slower

28:22.769 --> 28:23.669
after it left its port.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.504
So does that mean
anything to you guys?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.073
It could.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.408
Cobalt-RE is a missile
guidance system.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.077
Uh-huh. Four units disappeared

28:31.110 --> 28:33.345
from a Pakistani army
base 12 weeks ago.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.047
NSA's been tracking them,

28:35.081 --> 28:36.515
but they lost them
crossing into Thailand,

28:36.548 --> 28:38.250
If you continue
on that trajectory...

28:38.284 --> 28:40.519
Right. Singapore.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.455
Cobalt's relatively compact
and easy to program,

28:43.489 --> 28:46.325
but its main advantage is that
it's capable of being mated

28:46.358 --> 28:47.459
with several
Katyusha-style rockets.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.928
Katyushas are common,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.362
but they're not considered
a grave threat

28:50.396 --> 28:51.430
because they fly a
ballistic trajectory.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.499
They... You aim and fire;
they go where they go...

28:53.532 --> 28:54.967
Yeah, but not
if they're attached

28:55.001 --> 28:56.468
to those guidance
systems, right?

28:56.502 --> 28:58.370
You know? I mean,
how much they weigh?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.171
Four units,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.073
85 pounds each,
plus the crates...

29:01.107 --> 29:02.408
a little over 400 pounds.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.510
418 pounds is what I got.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.078
So they're here,
they're in the U.S.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.480
Yeah, and they got
a two-day jump on us.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.793
LIZ: So what exactly are we up
against?

29:20.827 --> 29:22.228
We know the guidance
systems were pulled

29:22.261 --> 29:23.996
off the Cheetah
about 38 hours ago,

29:24.030 --> 29:25.431
so the question is,
where are they now?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.299
I think the question is
where are they headed?

29:27.333 --> 29:30.202
And does that party have
the rockets to marry them to?

29:30.236 --> 29:33.105
Now, our best lead
is Reid Sarasin,

29:33.139 --> 29:34.874
the skipper on the Cheetah.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.108
LIZ:
What do we know about him?

29:36.142 --> 29:37.109
He's a top-
notch sailor,

29:37.143 --> 29:39.178
but, like most of
the skippers in the race,

29:39.211 --> 29:40.212
he's really just a gun-for-hire.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.547
I doubt his
loyalties

29:41.580 --> 29:43.082
to the owner
go much beyond

29:43.115 --> 29:45.084
whatever he has to do
to make a paycheck.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.185
All right, good.
How do we find him?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.887
His wife's in L.A.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.021
Let's get her in here.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.324
I don't see you as a woman
in mourning, Mrs. Sarasin.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.260
That's 'cause I
haven't given up hope

29:54.293 --> 29:55.862
my husband will be found.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.396
Right. That, or he's already

29:57.429 --> 29:59.331
contacted you and let
you know he's still alive.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.599
That's ridiculous.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.534
There's still a search out
looking for him...

30:02.568 --> 30:04.937
MEGAN:
Your husband races yachts

30:04.971 --> 30:06.272
around the world?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.407
Must be pretty exciting.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.843
I don't do much
traveling anymore.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.112
I didn't mean for you.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.381
I can't imagine he's
around much, huh?

30:15.414 --> 30:18.050
And you have... three children?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.518
What do my kids have
to do with this?

30:19.551 --> 30:22.088
Well, it paints a pretty
complete picture for me.

30:22.121 --> 30:25.958
All I see is you at home,
alone, raising three children,

30:25.992 --> 30:29.261
and your husband is out partying
like he's still 25 years old.

30:29.295 --> 30:32.264
Haven't you made enough
sacrifices for this man?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.566
COLBY: The nature of what your
husband

30:34.600 --> 30:36.368
was smuggling, Mrs. Sarasin,

30:36.402 --> 30:39.305
means that he can be
classified as a terrorist,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.941
and the fact that
you're helping him

30:41.974 --> 30:45.144
means that you can be classified
as a terrorist also,

30:45.177 --> 30:49.248
and you can be
detained indefinitely.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.283
MEGAN: Which means you'd be
sacrificing your kids, too.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.120
Is that something you really

30:54.153 --> 30:56.388
want to do for him?

30:56.422 --> 31:00.226
Do you think he would ever do
something like that for you?

31:03.662 --> 31:07.266
COLBY: So this boat belongs to a
friend of the Sarasins.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.936
The wife says he's been hiding
out on it for a while.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.603
Your lead.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.657
Reid Sarasin!

31:31.690 --> 31:33.259
Federal agents! Come on out!

32:02.288 --> 32:04.256
He's not in here.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.092
Looks like he was.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.526
Do you think his
wife tipped him off?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.395
No, I don't, but she might have
known he was already gone.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.363
I'll call it in to Don.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.699
See if they want to have
another go at the wife.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.135
(dialing)

32:24.210 --> 32:26.045
Hey, guys, come here.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.148
Took a look at that.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.456
(coughing)

32:37.489 --> 32:38.657
All right, Captain Nemo.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.992
Let's go.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.994
Up on the dock.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.431
SARASIN:
You think I chose to put

32:45.464 --> 32:46.598
those crates on my boat?

32:46.632 --> 32:47.699
My life was threatened.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.101
I was forced to.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.336
Yeah, they forced you to cash

32:50.369 --> 32:51.437
that big check
they wrote for you, too?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.605
The whole thing unraveled

32:53.639 --> 32:55.407
when the damn boat
started leaking.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.344
I mean, it was supposed
to be easy, just sail in,

32:58.377 --> 33:01.347
unload the crates, sail out
on the next leg of the race.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.414
Who'd you give the guidance
systems to?

33:02.448 --> 33:03.582
Who'd you meet with on this end?

33:03.615 --> 33:05.017
Two guys.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.085
I don't know their names.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.519
All I had was a phone number.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.721
Hey, pal, you better
do better than that.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.490
You're looking at a triple
murder rap.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.591
Wait, are you kidding me?

33:12.624 --> 33:14.593
- Triple murder rap.
- I had nothing to do with that!

33:14.626 --> 33:15.561
No?

33:15.594 --> 33:18.197
Look, all I did was sail the
boat, that's it.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.199
- I didn't kill anybody.
- GRAVES: Yeah, you were there.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.101
You were on the salvage barge.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.503
Yeah, I was there
to show these two guys

33:24.536 --> 33:25.604
where the Cheetah went down,

33:25.637 --> 33:28.307
so they could find
their crates.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.509
I had no idea they were
going to kill the crew

33:30.542 --> 33:32.744
after they got what they wanted.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.081
Reid, we need to know
where those crates are now.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.616
I don't know.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.285
When did you
last see them?

33:39.318 --> 33:41.587
When we came back in
on the barge.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.356
They unloaded the crates
onto a truck,

33:44.390 --> 33:46.392
you know, one of those
yellow box vans.

33:46.425 --> 33:47.626
DON: Did you hear them say
anything

33:47.659 --> 33:49.428
about where
they were going?

33:49.461 --> 33:52.664
Not exactly, but...

33:52.698 --> 33:55.067
I do know that
they weren't planning

33:55.101 --> 33:56.735
on leaving L.A.
right away.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.304
They were waiting.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.605
They were waiting?

33:59.638 --> 34:00.539
For what?

34:00.572 --> 34:03.575
For missiles.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.511
Missiles in
Los Angeles?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.421
You got to be pretty
damn committed

34:15.454 --> 34:17.489
to the cause to be smuggling
missiles into the U.S.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.791
NSA have any idea who the
end customer is on this?

34:19.825 --> 34:21.827
Hashim Aziz is
an arms dealer at heart.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.329
His politics
would never keep him

34:23.362 --> 34:24.463
from selling
to the highest bidder.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.565
- I'll tell you that.
- So now it could be anybody?

34:26.598 --> 34:28.667
DON: So I just brought Homeland
up to speed.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.536
They're gonna up security
force, but... All right.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.503
Charlie's back,
excellent.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.605
Come on, I'll catch you up.
Let's go, guys.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.874
According to Sarasin, the
guidance systems left the docks

34:35.907 --> 34:38.844
in a yellow box van
similar to this one.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.646
- A rental?
- We don't know for sure.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.549
We've got agents checking with
all the local rental companies.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.650
Suspects are two males,

34:44.683 --> 34:45.817
Middle-Eastern
descent.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.419
The contact number
they gave Sarasin

34:47.453 --> 34:48.487
traces
to a "World Phone."

34:48.520 --> 34:50.456
It's a Jordanian carrier,
and they won't help us.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.657
CORDERO:
Our people are generating

34:51.690 --> 34:55.361
a list of Hashim Aziz's known
associates in Los Angeles.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.463
Maybe Sarasin can
help ID one of them.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.597
No, that's a long shot.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.665
This whole thing's a long shot.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.167
We got two suspects

35:01.200 --> 35:02.768
with a 40-hour
lead on us in a city

35:02.801 --> 35:04.336
of eight million?

35:04.370 --> 35:05.537
- Your odds aren't good.
- DON: All right,

35:05.571 --> 35:06.538
so, you got anything?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.140
I don't, but our friends

35:08.174 --> 35:09.241
at the NSA might.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.210
After all, you guys
have the most

35:11.243 --> 35:12.778
comprehensive space-based
surveillance

35:12.811 --> 35:14.646
and reconnaissance
network in the entire world.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.183
Professor, we've thought
about satellites,

35:17.216 --> 35:19.318
but the problem with that
type of application

35:19.351 --> 35:20.652
is that there's just
too much information.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.887
We've got four birds above us...

35:21.920 --> 35:23.155
Five.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.356
I'm sorry, five birds.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.592
Yeah, Geo-16 was put
into orbit in August.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.160
CORDERO:
Fine.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.528
Five birds,
sending constant imaging

35:29.561 --> 35:31.797
of 4,700 square miles,
I mean, do you have any idea

35:31.830 --> 35:33.499
of how much information
that is?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.567
You could spend 30 years
going through the images

35:35.601 --> 35:37.503
and still not find
what you're looking for.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.805
Not if we apply a target
discrimination algorithm.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.340
I don't know what that is.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.308
Well, you do.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.910
No offense, but even
a five year old knows.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.378
See, he uses it

35:46.412 --> 35:47.913
every time he goes
to his toy box.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.681
Let's say he's looking

35:49.715 --> 35:51.517
for his favorite little
yellow toy truck.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.919
But his toy bin is filled
with all his other toys.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.655
First he eliminates
the stuffed animals.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.358
Then the airplanes,
then the action figures.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.560
He continues sorting
by size, color, weight.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.762
Until he finds his little
yellow toy truck.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.532
And I can do the same thing
with satellite images.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.634
I create an algorithm that tells
the computer

36:08.667 --> 36:09.335
what we're looking for

36:09.368 --> 36:10.202
and what we're not looking for

36:10.236 --> 36:13.239
that weeds out
false alarm variables

36:13.272 --> 36:14.440
and compensates
for urban clutter.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.941
All right, good, so,
what do you need?

36:15.974 --> 36:19.478
I'm going to need access

36:19.511 --> 36:20.779
to your computers.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.782
I'll make the call.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.553
Hey, still searching.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.388
Long time.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.557
Well, I've added criteria
to the discrimination filter.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.891
I mean, that should help.

36:32.924 --> 36:33.992
What's it doing now?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.361
Yeah, we're landing some
images now.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.628
There's likely to be
a lot at first.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.404
Got a yellow box truck

36:45.437 --> 36:46.938
outside a port warehouse
in San Pedro.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.807
Yeah, how do you know
it's the right one?

36:48.840 --> 36:50.442
The banked
satellite images,

36:50.476 --> 36:51.710
followed its trail all the way
back to Morris Salvage.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.211
All right, let's go,
let's hit it.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.317
(horn honking in distance)

36:58.350 --> 37:00.319
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:07.393 --> 37:09.461
MAN (over radio):
Spotter four has two suspects

37:09.495 --> 37:10.629
inside the rear door.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.897
They got two inside,
southeast corner.

37:18.604 --> 37:19.805
Go, let's go, hit it, hit it,
hit it!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.046
FBI!

37:28.079 --> 37:29.247
FBI!

37:37.356 --> 37:39.658
(gunshots)

37:50.001 --> 37:51.370
Drop it!

38:01.613 --> 38:03.715
Get out of the car!

38:03.749 --> 38:05.451
Get down!
Down on the ground!

38:09.020 --> 38:10.556
Colby, you okay?

38:10.589 --> 38:11.590
We're good, Don.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.692
You all right?

38:13.725 --> 38:14.526
Yeah.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.595
Roger that,
suspect is in custody.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.897
All clear, repeating, all clear.

38:18.930 --> 38:23.068
(siren wailing in distance)

38:28.807 --> 38:31.410
Crates are all
here, full.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.678
The guidance systems
accounted for.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.745
How about missiles?

38:33.779 --> 38:34.846
Any sign of them?

38:34.880 --> 38:36.882
We found this shipping
invoice inside.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.385
A container ship coming
in tomorrow from Malaysia.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.620
"Teak furniture."

38:41.653 --> 38:43.622
I don't think these guys are
waiting on a patio set?

38:43.655 --> 38:44.756
Got a call in
to the Coast Guard.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.792
We'll be waiting for 'em
tomorrow with Homeland security

38:46.825 --> 38:48.427
when those missiles
arrive.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.461
All right, good job, guys.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.762
You, too.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.030
Yeah, we'll go get some beers
some time, huh.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.765
Several.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.734
All right.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.111
Nice work.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.746
Yeah, you, too.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.783
We're all right together.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.718
See.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.620
That's what I've been
telling you, huh?

39:16.154 --> 39:17.689
I don't want
to get hurt.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.425
Yeah.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.160
Kind of goes with the
territory though doesn't it?

39:22.193 --> 39:23.395
Yeah, easy for you
to say.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.362
Oh, yeah, why's that?

39:24.396 --> 39:26.998
I know your reputation,
Mr. No Commitments.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.536
I just haven't met
the right girl yet.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.070
Okay.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.108
Let's take it slow.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.611
Keep it to ourselves.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.913
Yeah, look, I'm in the FBI.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.148
I know how to keep a secret.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.516
Good.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.152
See you tomorrow, Agent.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.987
That's Special Agent to you,
by the way.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.565
Uh...

39:59.598 --> 40:00.699
Sorry.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.468
Understood.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.069
Take your time.

40:04.102 --> 40:05.637
Thank you.

40:05.671 --> 40:06.805
Okay.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.778
(laughing):
That's what I thought.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.746
No, that, that was, uh, fine.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.548
What?

40:16.582 --> 40:18.650
Would you just
pick up a piece.

40:18.684 --> 40:19.718
And move it.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.786
I will.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.220
Hey, what's going on?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.456
We're playing chess?

40:24.490 --> 40:25.891
Oh, is that what it is? Yeah.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.225
'Cause I sure don't
recognize that.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.494
What are you
so grumpy about?

40:28.527 --> 40:29.595
I'm not.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.163
Your father has a "tell."

40:32.197 --> 40:33.799
What, as in poker?

40:33.832 --> 40:35.934
(sing-songy):
Mm-hmm. Alan has a chess tell.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.503
Oh, would you listen to...
I have a "tell?"

40:37.536 --> 40:38.837
The woman has ruined

40:38.870 --> 40:40.238
the spirit of the game.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.940
I mean, this is supposed
to be about strategy,

40:41.973 --> 40:43.174
about anticipation.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.710
This is supposed to be art.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.578
You beat him, didn't you?

40:46.612 --> 40:47.212
I did.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.480
I'm so sorry.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.515
The first game.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.381
But it wasn't his fault.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.850
He had no idea
that I was reading him.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.119
- No, I was just being nice.
- You were nice.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.153
You play poker, do you, Millie?

40:55.186 --> 40:56.121
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.723
It wasn't just
the fellowship

40:57.756 --> 40:58.890
that got me through
grad school, G-man.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.125
I think I'm hearing a bit

41:00.158 --> 41:01.226
of a challenge there.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.494
What do you guys say?

41:02.528 --> 41:03.529
MILLIE:
For what poker?

41:03.562 --> 41:05.030
Against the Eppes ladies?

41:05.063 --> 41:06.097
Ooh.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.232
Oh, yes.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.233
- I'm in.
- Anything is better

41:08.266 --> 41:09.701
than playing this anymore.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.537
- I'm in. All right.
- Let's do it.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.838
Oh, wait, there's,
there's no beer.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.106
You heard the lady,
get her a beer.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.609
All right, we're gonna do
a little, uh, practice round.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.611
'Til the beverages
arrive.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.613
How about, uh,
seven card, hi-lo,

41:21.647 --> 41:23.882
blind declare...
and please, no whining.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.851
(laughs)
Bring it on, bring it on.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.252
You ate every chip
and all the dip.

41:27.285 --> 41:28.754
No, I didn't.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.221
You guys are like
the Three Stooges.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.190
All right, chip,
dip, skip, let's go.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.959
How about just
playing a game?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.894
(overlapping chatter)
