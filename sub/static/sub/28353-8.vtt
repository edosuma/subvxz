00:17.767 --> 00:18.767
Hey.

00:19.477 --> 00:20.477
Where's Cesar?

00:21.813 --> 00:23.773
Not sure. He's been ghosting me.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.177
When's the last time you saw him?

00:25.740 --> 00:26.780
A few weeks ago.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.029
The kid who shot your friend
has been spotted in town.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.364
Latrelle?

00:31.906 --> 00:32.906
Can you tell him?

00:34.826 --> 00:35.827
I haven't seen him.

00:35.910 --> 00:40.999
Well, when you don't see him
again, tell him I said, "Be safe."

00:55.722 --> 00:56.723
How are you holding up?

00:57.724 --> 01:00.143
- I know it's a little cramped.
- It's all good, Father.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.688
I've slept better here in the last
two weeks than I have all year.

01:03.772 --> 01:07.317
Good to hear. Oh, and your friend's
mom dropped this off for you.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.401
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.657
- Do you want some?
- Yes.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.284
Thank you.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.169
Is he your son?

01:28.421 --> 01:29.421
Salvador.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.509
I haven't seen him for 47 days.

01:33.134 --> 01:36.429
They say he's somewhere in Texas.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.223
I'm sorry.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.934
- It must be hard to be apart.
- Yes, it is.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.894
But at least we're safe here.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.856
In Guatemala, we could never leave
the house because of the gangs.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.444
Here, we have a chance at a better life.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.658
What about you? American, right?

01:58.660 --> 01:59.828
Why are you here?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.165
I've lost my family.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.336
And I don't have a home.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.235
- Hey.
- Hey!

02:15.635 --> 02:18.680
I got you toothpaste, deodorant,
vitamins, and fiber bars.

02:18.763 --> 02:22.100
Thanks. But, uh, nutrition
is the least of my problems.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.396
What? What's wrong?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.773
I'm sorry. I'll eat the fiber bar.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.777
I ran into Officer Hammel.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.196
He said Latrelle is back in town.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.115
Okay.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.827
Okay? What do you mean, "okay"?

02:40.910 --> 02:43.621
Latrelle is not gonna
roll up in the church.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.140
I'm safe.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.624
But you can't stay here forever.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.085
Father Carlos said I can
stay as long as I need,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.088
which won't be forever,
but long enough to...

02:52.797 --> 02:55.175
you know, plan my next
move without being hasty.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.595
I'm gonna be fine.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.143
But you won't be if
you're late for class.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.478
Get out of here.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.815
You're not in this class.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.193
Officer Hammel said Latrelle
is back to finish the job.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.570
Or for a hood day. It's the
Prophets hood day this week.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.364
Latrelle's not back for some glorified
block party. It's too risky.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.520
He's been put off. So if
he has a body on his belt,

03:20.530 --> 03:21.590
the body that he missed,

03:21.600 --> 03:22.610
he will redeem himself.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.329
We have to give Cesar
cash so he can dip.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.789
- We can't!
- Not until it's clean!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.499
- No one will know.
- Monse?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.961
You are stuck on repeat, okay?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.838
We can't spend the money
until it's cleaned.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.758
The money is over 30 years old and
some of the bills look different.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.801
It's like... it might as well be marked!

03:38.885 --> 03:41.346
- As usual, you're being hyperbolic.
- No!

03:41.429 --> 03:43.681
Not if the bills create
unwanted attention.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.767
Cesar holding out in the church
isn't the worst thing for him.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.394
The worst thing is if
he ends up in juvie...

03:48.478 --> 03:50.355
- or foster care.
- Or dead!

03:50.430 --> 03:52.460
So we need a real plan. We need it now.

03:52.470 --> 03:53.733
We can't just sit on the cash.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.818
We have to make it work
to get Cesar out of town.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.196
So chew on some new ideas and
we'll chop it up at lunch.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.617
Look.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.284
Do you want some gum?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.623
Have I done anything?

04:12.126 --> 04:15.088
This is supposed to be a
safe place. God's house.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.339
But you're the devil.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.591
- I'm the devil?
- Are you in a gang?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.093
I was.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.595
Not anymore.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.723
- I didn't have a choice.
- What do you know about choices? Huh?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.060
It's easy to follow the
herd. Like a sheep.

04:29.143 --> 04:32.313
But you don't know what it means
to sacrifice your entire life

04:32.397 --> 04:34.857
to protect all those you love.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.485
Don't talk about not having
choices. We all have them.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.864
You just don't have the balls
to make difficult decisions.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.244
- Look, I...
- All of you, listen, please!

04:46.320 --> 04:48.420
I've been informed that ICE

04:48.440 --> 04:51.291
has raided a number of
churches in the area.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.835
Please, get ready to leave
at a moment's notice.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.753
Please, just take only what you need.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.299
Come on, girl, hurry up. Quick!

04:59.924 --> 05:01.301
Let's go this way.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.593
Come on. Come on.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.179
Hurry up! Hurry up!

05:12.228 --> 05:13.980
ICE might be raiding the church.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.566
Cesar is gonna have to vacate or
he might end up in the system.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.609
- Shit!
- What's the local news saying?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.446
Ugh. I hate this ad. This
song is so annoying.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.281
This shit's my jam!

05:23.781 --> 05:24.782
What are you doing?

05:24.866 --> 05:27.035
Chopping it up and chowing
it down with my crew.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.787
Is it my pits? I just switched
to natural deodorant.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.081
- I knew that shit didn't work.
- We need a rain check.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
Nothing personal, but it's personal.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.626
What's on the agenda?
Cleaning some green?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.086
How do you know?

05:37.140 --> 05:38.430
_

05:39.130 --> 05:40.715
What? I'm a visual thinker!

05:41.880 --> 05:43.100
Don't get your chonies in a twist.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.710
Ain't nobody worried
about a few dollars.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.722
It's not a few dollars?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.891
Are you involved with the
Freeridge Savings heist?

05:49.974 --> 05:51.360
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.540
But what you should know

05:52.550 --> 05:54.050
is you don't wanna get
involved in that shit.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.350
It's marked money.

05:55.430 --> 05:56.879
Thanks for the useless info dump,

05:56.880 --> 05:58.524
but we need to get back
to our crisis now.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.303
How are we gonna clean the money?

06:01.986 --> 06:04.113
♪ Money Bunny, Money Bunny! ♪

06:06.032 --> 06:07.784
♪ Gotta hop to it fast ♪

06:07.867 --> 06:09.202
♪ And get your money! ♪

06:09.285 --> 06:10.578
Money Bunny is a shitty company

06:10.661 --> 06:11.871
that takes advantage of
people who have no other way

06:11.954 --> 06:14.707
to get money from one place to
another. It's a racket and...

06:14.791 --> 06:15.792
Ah!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.335
♪ Money Bunny ♪

06:17.418 --> 06:18.418
A great idea!

06:19.212 --> 06:22.465
Yes! Out goin' dirty dinero,
in coming clean clams!

06:22.548 --> 06:25.259
Minus their three percent
fee? Scrub-a-dub, bitches!

06:25.343 --> 06:27.428
- I'm not following.
- Okay, uh...

06:27.450 --> 06:28.540
Say Jamal wants to help

06:28.550 --> 06:30.431
a certain fashion-challenged
friend buy a new fit.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.977
Oh! Monse! Money Bunny takes his
hundie and they give Jamal a code.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.979
Then Jamal gives the
code to mono-boob Monse,

06:37.063 --> 06:38.523
who takes it to the store and bam!

06:38.606 --> 06:41.359
She's got a hundred bucks to ditch
a sports bra and buy some lace.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
Underwire's your friend, girl.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.612
But wire fraud.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.115
That's a felony. The count's
at least five years.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.992
- I'm in.
- Me too.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.872
Do you want this nightmare to stop?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.834
Then we go big, or
Cesar never goes home.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.463
I'm in.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.216
Damn! You guys are a ride or die!

07:05.299 --> 07:07.343
But you still got to be 18 to
send and receive the dough.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.387
So, you guys got some fake IDs?

07:09.470 --> 07:11.389
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I'm law enforcement.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.641
But you just taught us how
to commit wire fraud.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.763
Because sometimes I like to get dirty

07:15.764 --> 07:17.603
and straddle things, like the line.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.355
I'm a complicated woman.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.607
Which means you probably
know where to get a fake ID.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.110
No! No way. I don't.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.780
But Mona Mardukas has a guy.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.826
No!

07:32.910 --> 07:35.371
- You want two IDs?
- I texted you. We need three.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.165
I only see two people.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.625
Oh! Don't act like you don't
see me standing here, Chivo!

07:39.709 --> 07:42.503
- I'm ghosting you.
- Chivo?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.713
As in Chivo, Chivo?

07:43.796 --> 07:47.425
- Um-hm.
- No. Chivo as in Chivo Ramirez.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.927
- He's gonna play us.
- Bye, bye.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.137
W... W... Wait...

07:51.220 --> 07:52.420
Put the bad blood aside

07:52.430 --> 07:54.230
and think of all the
referrals I've given you.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.435
First cousins alone, that
got to be over 100 people.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.481
Wait, no, no, no. Please, help us.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.300
Okay.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.861
Under one condition.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.582
"Lou Sassole?"

08:20.750 --> 08:22.251
You're crazy.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.961
You are.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.963
Not talking to you.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.514
- What? I wasn't ready!
- No do-overs.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.159
What is this place, anyway?

08:37.169 --> 08:39.143
I thought you lived in the
Winnebago by the nursery.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.360
I do.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.460
This is my safehouse.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.357
My house that is safe.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.401
Okay. Here are all the
Money Bunny locations.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.100
And these four are in close proximity,

08:49.110 --> 08:50.360
so we'll be in and out quickly.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.489
- Who's next?
- Me.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.660
Monse? Outside.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.956
- What do you want?
- Look around.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.600
Yeah?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.086
What do you see?

09:05.670 --> 09:08.631
- Houses.
- What kind of houses?

09:09.131 --> 09:11.008
- Boring houses?
- Exactly!

09:11.092 --> 09:13.219
- You know who lives in boring houses?
- Boring people.

09:13.302 --> 09:17.181
Yes, woman, yes! Which
makes this place safe!

09:17.265 --> 09:18.265
Smell what's cooking?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.434
Applebee's?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.312
What? We drove by at least
five on the way here.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.316
Good observation. But not the
point. The point is Cesar!

09:27.820 --> 09:28.980
He can be safe here.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.613
And, if he stays, it'll buy us more
time to "pasteurize the brie."

09:33.155 --> 09:36.117
Oh, my God! Yes, this is perfect.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.820
But how are we going
to get Chivo to agree?

09:37.821 --> 09:38.840
The money isn't clean yet.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.497
We don't need money. I got
something he wants even more.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.640
Okay. Cesar stays here for five weeks

09:44.660 --> 09:46.210
and you get Juanita every other week.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.046
One week for your homie.
Juanita stays forever.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.172
You're killing me, Chivo.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.508
We've been walking around in
circles, and getting nowhere.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.843
I need my steps.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.762
Okay. How about this?

09:57.050 --> 09:58.380
Cesar stays here for one month

09:58.400 --> 10:01.267
and you get weekly unsupervised
visits with Juanita.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.935
How about this?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.605
Your homie gets one week.
Juanita stays forever.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.065
Walk in place.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.404
He's not budging.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.927
- I need you to close.
- Why don't you just give him the doll?

10:16.360 --> 10:17.540
She's not a doll.

10:17.570 --> 10:20.328
She's a porcelain collectible
with thoughts and feelings.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.414
Way more human than the sock
you're in a relationship with.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.666
Fine. I'm going in.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.212
Chivo.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.757
Let's talk.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.926
Walk and talk. I need 823 more steps.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.722
Listen, I get your frustrations.

10:39.805 --> 10:44.060
And what Jamal did by seducing
Juanita was an unspeakable atrocity.

10:44.143 --> 10:48.314
Don't let his transgressions
blind you to a simple fact.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.358
Cesar is a Santo.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.860
Part of the legacy that
your cousin began.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.236
By turning your back on him,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.739
you'd be turning your back
on everything he stood for.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.492
Santos are a family.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.664
So Cesar is also part of your
family. So do the prudent thing

11:04.747 --> 11:06.624
and reconsider our offer.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.043
Okay.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.003
Final offer.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.881
One week for your homie.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.300
Juanita stays forever.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.562
Come on.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.657
- Chivo, Cesar. Cesar, Chivo.
- Where is she?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.201
She... She can't breathe!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.711
Not yet! I need a moment.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.799
Hey.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.053
Listen, I don't want you
to take this personally.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.973
But, baby, this is not goodbye forever.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.015
Okay?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.852
It's just goodbye for now.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.072
Make way!

12:22.199 --> 12:25.244
Mother Nature is on the line.
I need a bathroom now.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.996
Number one or number two?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.122
Number three.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.888
You okay?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.227
I can't even imagine how
hard this must be for you.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.315
But you gotta stay positive,
focus on your blessings.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.983
You have a safe place
to stay for a week.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.068
We have a plan to clean the
cash through Money Bunny.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.780
And we're doing a test run
tomorrow. And if it works,

13:00.863 --> 13:02.823
we'll get you out of
town into a new place.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.243
Thank you.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.582
Seriously. Thank you for...

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
for never giving up on me.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.554
Here's your Money Bunny wire code
and thank you for shopping with us.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.097
And cut!

13:28.015 --> 13:31.519
Monse, you need to unclench,
girl. Top and bottom.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.360
I can hear your chocha getting cramps.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.780
And try smiling once in a while.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.192
It goes a long way. Both
in wire fraud and in life.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.402
Next customer!

13:44.114 --> 13:46.534
- Hi, I'd like to...
- Gimme a sec. Machine's down.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.119
- Why you so sweaty?
- Who? Me?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.892
No, the bozo behind you. Yeah, you.

13:50.893 --> 13:52.456
You're doing something suspicious?

13:52.540 --> 13:53.666
No.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.877
Okay. Machine's up. Go.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.214
- I'd like to send some money.
- Mm-hmm. I bet you would.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.216
- Name?
- Christopher Sanchez.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.385
- Birth date?
- June 19, 1999.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.470
- Mother's maiden name?
- They can ask that?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.514
We are not dealing
with amateurs, people.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.183
These are highly-trained
part-time sales associates.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.977
You'll need to be on your A-game.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.647
And, Ruby, work the face
more. That's an asset.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.649
So use it. Next!

14:21.777 --> 14:23.153
Hey, yo, what's up, Ma?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.949
I'm trying to Money Bunny
$450 to my baby, Ma.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.326
You see, I had a baby out of wedlock.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.122
And now I'm financially responsible
for my son, Maximilian.

14:33.205 --> 14:37.293
- Milian, for short...
- Okay, love, love, love the commitment,

14:37.376 --> 14:38.544
but way too many details.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.837
Details are a tell.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.506
And that tell will lead them
straight to checking your ID.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.439
Remember. You don't have time for deets.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.960
'Cause you're 18 and
you got places to be.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.929
Or I'm a warm and friendly person
who likes to make friends.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.139
Or it's clear that you're 14

14:51.140 --> 14:52.860
and have way too much
"me" time on your hands.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.435
- Uh!
- You know what?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.604
We don't need to over-rehearse this.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.207
I think three hours is plenty of time.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.691
I think we're ready for a test run.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.163
This is a great Hot Pocket.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.668
I got 70 more in the freezer.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.337
Good to know.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.555
Do you float?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.182
In what context?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.233
Turn around.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.160
Nine, nine, nine, nine.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.953
Uh...

16:03.545 --> 16:04.713
Let's take a dip.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.467
Just chill.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.886
- Chill.
- Chill? I can't chill.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.305
I'm like a goddamn sweat
lodge under here.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.016
What's with no air conditioning?
Are they trying to torture us?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.810
- Okay, quiz me.
- What's your birth date?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.603
- August 12, 2004.
- Dude.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.314
- That's your real one.
- God damn it!

16:22.398 --> 16:25.484
Why did I agree with this? This is
too much pressure. I can't do it.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.778
- Relax.
- Sorry. I'm fine.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.697
It's just that... Sir!

16:29.780 --> 16:32.866
I can hear you breathing!
Can you take one step back?

16:33.617 --> 16:34.660
One more! One more!

16:34.743 --> 16:37.287
You, too! I need
personal space and food.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.207
Even if it's off the floor. I
just need a snack. I need snacks!

16:40.290 --> 16:42.001
- Next customer?
- Right there. Right there.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.293
Go.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.757
I'd like to Money Bunny
some money to my honey.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.553
My baby mama, the mother of my child.

16:52.636 --> 16:55.389
- How much?
- A hundred bucks, minus the chips.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.307
ID?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.397
Mm...

17:03.480 --> 17:04.815
Mm...

17:10.695 --> 17:11.695
Security!

17:16.660 --> 17:18.203
Is this your real last name?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.999
Yes. What's he reaching for?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.669
- I'm a Sassole, too!
- Crazy, right?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.879
You're all set. Make sure
you give the recipient

17:33.880 --> 17:35.020
the confirmation number.

17:37.973 --> 17:38.973
Sir!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.399
Hey, thank you for letting me stay here.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.359
What did you do?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.154
You don't get a green light for nothing.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.407
It's what I didn't do.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.410
I didn't kill someone.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.789
Lil' Ricky didn't believe
in violence either.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.666
- Get out of here.
- I can't.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.919
I'm floating.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.798
The founder of the Santos
didn't believe in violence?

18:12.257 --> 18:14.635
- I find that hard to buy.
- It's not for sale.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.303
It's a fact.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.680
You see, Santos didn't start off bad.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.100
Lil' Ricky liked protecting people.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.936
When he died, the wrong
element took over.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.230
Hector, no!

18:26.897 --> 18:28.565
We're at maximum occupancy.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.152
He always pees in the pool.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.992
Hey, I got to ask. And...

18:39.576 --> 18:41.203
I don't mean any disrespect.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.872
What's up with the gnomes?

18:44.331 --> 18:47.668
They're my friends, repping
the original Santos.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.335
Rest in peace.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.632
Benito and Frankie got got in prison.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.553
Little Half Dead... Well,
now he's full dead.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.265
Got stabbed. Pistola, the sugars.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.518
Trigger, Joker, Gary.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.648
They were found the easy way.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.067
- A drive by?
- No.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.361
Their old ladies' cribs.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.739
Quickest way to a man...

19:19.700 --> 19:21.285
is through his hyna.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.458
So which one's Lil' Ricky?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.335
He lives in all of them.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.921
He would've liked you.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.132
Wish I knew him.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.600
Gotta go.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.014
Lyft is here.

19:42.806 --> 19:43.806
Book club.

19:47.477 --> 19:50.981
This is no longer a fire drill,
but a full-on three-alarm blaze.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.443
But, if you remember what we
practiced, nobody gets burned.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.694
It's all about confidence,

19:55.770 --> 19:57.400
which I know is gonna be hard for you,

19:57.410 --> 19:59.156
because, you know, all of that.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.699
But you are no longer Monse,

20:00.782 --> 20:04.161
the slouchy 14 year old with ashy
knees and shitty split ends. No.

20:04.244 --> 20:08.749
You are Paloma Vincent, a fiery
19 year old from Stockton.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.291
Okay.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.212
Okay, girl. You're up. Go get 'em.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.131
Can I help you?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.425
- Yeah...
- Girl, let me tell you about her man.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.677
He ain't shit!

20:20.761 --> 20:23.388
He had the nerve to get her knocked
up. Then left her high and dry

20:23.472 --> 20:25.307
as soon as baby little
Maximilian was born.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.518
And then he thinks that if he sends
her money every once in a while,

20:28.602 --> 20:31.688
that's gonna make everything
all right. But, girl, please!

20:31.772 --> 20:33.398
Paloma here is a G!

20:33.482 --> 20:35.475
The last thing she needs
is a man like that.

20:35.476 --> 20:36.944
She may not be much to look at...

20:38.779 --> 20:40.197
I have a confirmation number.

20:57.260 --> 20:58.670
Holy shit! We did it!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.468
Yes! Yes!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.805
Guess she's not straddling anymore.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.348
Welcome to the dark side.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.687
Cesar is gonna be so happy.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.438
Where's Jasmine?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.191
Jas! Hurry up!

21:17.025 --> 21:18.402
I'm okay, I think...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.613
But I'm pretty sure I
number three'd myself.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.948
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-mm.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.324
- I gotta go.
- I'm not doing it.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.785
- What is number three?
- I don't even know.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.579
- Pee-pee, poo-poo.
- Gross.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.914
Hey, Monse!

21:30.998 --> 21:32.916
Where that bitch-ass
boyfriend of yours at?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.919
Hey, we already know he ain't
at your pop's spot no more,

21:36.003 --> 21:37.504
so where he at, then?

21:39.506 --> 21:41.675
And we already know
what's up with you, Ruby.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.553
Bang!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.266
Santo killer though.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.957
Cesar! Open the door!

22:15.083 --> 22:16.501
Cesar!

22:17.502 --> 22:18.520
Cesar!

22:18.545 --> 22:19.671
Hey, what's going on?

22:20.756 --> 22:24.176
We got rolled up on. The Prophets.
They were looking for you.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.762
And they knew you didn't work at
Dwayne's anymore. They knew my name!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.722
- Where's Monse? Is she okay?
- She's fine.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.160
She went home. Everyone went home,

22:30.170 --> 22:32.220
except for me. No one knows I'm here.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.437
- Shit. Shit. Shit!
- Breathe! Okay?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.815
This is never going to end.

22:39.350 --> 22:40.380
Latrelle won't go away.

22:40.390 --> 22:42.319
We're gonna be looking over
our shoulder all our lives.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.488
We have to go to the police.
Yeah, we could go to the police.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.780
The police? What are they gonna do?

22:46.900 --> 22:48.899
They already know
Latrelle's back in town

22:48.900 --> 22:50.720
and they are not doing shit!

22:54.706 --> 22:55.749
Then, we're dead.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.252
They're gonna kill us all.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.131
Compa! Listen to me.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.343
I'd die before I let anything happen
to you. You know that, right?

23:07.550 --> 23:08.620
Right?

23:12.224 --> 23:15.852
Go into the bathroom. Splash some
water on your face and breathe.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.561
Okay.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.983
God damn it!

24:03.733 --> 24:05.819
- Cesar? We're in trouble.
- Ruby told me.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.196
He's still at Chivo's. Are you okay?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.614
A little spooked, but I'm fine.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.492
What do you mean he's still at
Chivo's? Are you not there?

24:13.034 --> 24:14.119
Where are you?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.287
Hello?

24:17.873 --> 24:18.873
Cesar?

24:19.416 --> 24:20.584
I love you, Monse.
