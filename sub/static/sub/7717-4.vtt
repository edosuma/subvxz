All right, all right, gang.

09:16.158 --> 09:18.238
Let's just settle down.
You're yelling in her face.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.459
It's a medical thing.

09:19.461 --> 09:20.760
Just... You good?

09:20.762 --> 09:23.496
I'm good. I...
[Sighs]

09:23.498 --> 09:25.665
I'm so sorry for all of this.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.967
It's okay.

09:27.969 --> 09:31.137
You know what they say,
a change is as good as a rest.

09:31.139 --> 09:33.139
I... I need to get
to the paper, please.

09:33.141 --> 09:34.140
Sorry.

09:34.142 --> 09:35.275
Oh, God!

09:35.277 --> 09:36.576
- Oh, oh, my God!
- Okay...

09:36.578 --> 09:38.077
- Oh!
- I'll get you a napkin.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.546
Can someone get napkins, please?

09:39.548 --> 09:41.714
You know what, it's fine.
It's fine, let me just...

09:41.716 --> 09:42.715
It's fine.

09:42.717 --> 09:46.152
Pam, I'm really sorry.
I just...

09:46.154 --> 09:48.154
I'm... I'm really sorry
about all that.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.193
Really?
Smirking?

09:53.195 --> 09:55.995
What can I say?
I love justice.

09:55.997 --> 09:58.398
You forced me to spend money
on needless repairs,

09:58.400 --> 10:00.433
and now you're locked in a prison bus,

10:00.435 --> 10:02.368
and your woman drips with beverage.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.610
Hey, Dwight, I was trying
to do something nice for Pam.

10:04.611 --> 10:06.473
Can you just help me out?

10:06.475 --> 10:08.675
Can we maybe take this thing somewhere,

10:08.677 --> 10:10.844
or do something to not make this
the worst day ever?

10:10.846 --> 10:13.813
It's not my responsibility
to solve your marriage problems

10:13.815 --> 10:17.183
by spending my money on gas.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.587
Andy!

10:20.589 --> 10:22.021
Yo!
Toonces.

10:22.023 --> 10:23.239
You're the boss.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.240
Don't you think we'd all be
a lot more productive

10:25.241 --> 10:26.361
if while we were doing work,

10:26.362 --> 10:27.162
we looked up and saw

10:27.163 --> 10:28.803
the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?

10:28.804 --> 10:31.231
Ooh, I know I'd be more productive.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.566
- As would I.
- No question.

10:33.568 --> 10:35.735
No! No!
This is a work bus.

10:35.737 --> 10:38.037
The wheels are for transporting
the work space

10:38.039 --> 10:39.572
to and from the work site.

10:39.574 --> 10:40.840
What are you talking about?

10:40.842 --> 10:43.443
You're not the boss, Andy is.
Andy?

10:43.445 --> 10:47.347
All: Pies, pies, pies,
pies, pies, pies.

10:47.349 --> 10:52.018
All right!
The fat people have spoken.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.254
Dwight, get this bus moving.

10:54.256 --> 10:57.056
[All cheering and clapping]

10:57.058 --> 11:00.627
Next stop, Laverne's Pies,
Tires Fixed Also.

11:00.629 --> 11:02.862
Oh, yes!

11:02.864 --> 11:03.944
[All cheering and clapping]

11:03.945 --> 11:06.799
Yeah, Jim!

11:06.801 --> 11:08.234
So it looks like this work bus

11:08.236 --> 11:10.937
was a pretty good idea after all, huh?

11:10.939 --> 11:12.872
Get your foot behind the yellow line.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.874
You got it.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.644
[Applause] Yeah, Jim!

11:27.054 --> 11:28.288
- Stop.
- Come back.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.637
[Sighs]

12:17.639 --> 12:20.640
Oh, my God.

12:20.642 --> 12:24.143
Dunder Mifflin road trip 2012!

12:24.145 --> 12:27.680
Okay, now a serious one.

12:27.682 --> 12:29.682
Hey, where's Dwight?
He should be a part of this.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.953
Has he been acting
kind of weird to you lately?

12:33.955 --> 12:36.623
If by "lately," you mean
for the last 12 years, yeah.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.505
No, I mean, he's sulking.
That's not like him.

12:38.506 --> 12:40.126
He's just mad that we're all having fun.

12:40.128 --> 12:43.062
Then why isn't he scheming
or preparing to avenge?

12:44.632 --> 12:47.567
He's fine.
He's indestructible.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.871
Always say that a child
is placed for adoption,

12:51.873 --> 12:54.140
never surrendered.

12:54.142 --> 12:55.775
We're not hostages.

12:55.777 --> 12:58.811
[Chuckles] Although I have
considered kidnapping one.

12:58.813 --> 13:02.849
Oh, and never say that.

13:02.851 --> 13:05.718
I am so excited thinking about this child

13:05.720 --> 13:07.053
you're going to adopt.

13:07.055 --> 13:08.688
I wish I could just wave a magic wand

13:08.690 --> 13:11.157
and make you a parentless
five-year-old again.

13:11.159 --> 13:13.159
I would snap you up.

13:13.161 --> 13:15.695
Oh.

13:15.697 --> 13:17.697
Next stop, pies.

13:17.699 --> 13:19.165
[Chants] Next stop, pies!

13:19.167 --> 13:22.702
All: [Chanting] Next stop, pies,
next stop, pies!

13:22.704 --> 13:24.570
Let's go, driver!

13:24.572 --> 13:27.940
Laverne packs up the pie wagon
at 5:00, so...

13:27.942 --> 13:30.510
At 5:00?
That's only 20 minutes from now.

13:30.512 --> 13:33.680
The pie shop is 13 miles away.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.915
So at 55 miles an hour,

13:35.917 --> 13:38.418
that just gives us 5 minutes to spare.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.453
So, wait, when pies are involved,

13:40.455 --> 13:43.756
you can suddenly do math in your head?

13:43.758 --> 13:47.760
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies

13:47.762 --> 13:50.296
divided by 61 pies?

13:50.298 --> 13:54.067
314 pies.

13:54.069 --> 13:56.102
What if it were salads?

13:56.104 --> 13:59.338
Well, it's the...

13:59.340 --> 14:04.243
carry the four and the...
it doesn't work.

14:04.245 --> 14:06.713
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's
fantastic voyage, everyone,

14:06.715 --> 14:08.081
but we're almost out of gas.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.083
Okay, well, I saw a station
about a mile back,

14:10.085 --> 14:11.417
so chop, chop.

14:11.419 --> 14:13.853
That name brand place?
No, forget about it, sorry.

14:13.855 --> 14:17.056
The tanks are so big on
this thing, 5¢ a gallon extra?

14:17.058 --> 14:18.057
It really adds up.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.425
Are you kidding me?

14:19.427 --> 14:20.995
- Dwight, come on.
- Hey.

14:20.996 --> 14:22.596
Honey, I don't think we should push him.

14:22.597 --> 14:23.797
Oh, no, I'm going to push him.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.598
You know why?
Because you are getting a pie.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.166
Why?
'Cause you deserve it.

14:27.168 --> 14:28.163
And what is he doing?

14:28.164 --> 14:30.244
He's trying to drive us all
around the countryside,

14:30.245 --> 14:32.365
looking for gas because he
knows we won't get there.

14:32.366 --> 14:33.206
Is that what we want?

14:33.208 --> 14:34.507
All: No!

14:34.509 --> 14:36.242
Stop ordering me around, Jim!

14:36.244 --> 14:38.144
- What do we want?
All: - Pies!

14:38.146 --> 14:39.145
When do we want it?

14:39.147 --> 14:42.381
All: - Pies.
- Okay, fine.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.613
You win, Jim.
You win.

14:46.614 --> 14:48.134
We have been battling for a long time,

14:48.135 --> 14:49.255
but, you know what, you win.

14:49.257 --> 14:51.297
'Cause you are the winner,
you are the alpha male.

14:51.298 --> 14:52.058
There you go.

14:52.060 --> 14:53.559
Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.061
Go buy the whole world a pie.

14:55.063 --> 14:58.197
That's impossible.

14:58.199 --> 14:59.499
- Oh, no!
- Dwight!

14:59.501 --> 15:00.781
- What are you doing?
- Dwight!

15:00.782 --> 15:02.102
- What the hell?
- Whoa, Dwight.

15:02.103 --> 15:05.037
- Dwight.
- What?

15:05.039 --> 15:08.674
Well, now I don't even feel like pie.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.676
Wait.

15:10.678 --> 15:11.978
No, it's back.

15:15.698 --> 15:17.517
Just drive away.

15:17.753 --> 15:19.187
Phyllis, that's not safe.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.489
Guys, we only have 18 minutes left.

15:21.491 --> 15:24.659
At 61 miles an hour, we're just
going to barely make it.

15:24.661 --> 15:26.628
Go up and check on him, he's upset.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.230
You know he's doing all this on purpose.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.864
Please, just make sure he's okay.

15:29.866 --> 15:31.933
[Sighs]

15:31.935 --> 15:33.134
Hurry it up, for God's sake.

15:33.136 --> 15:34.769
They're going to be out of banana cream.

15:34.771 --> 15:36.037
Banana cream's the first to go.

15:36.039 --> 15:37.799
We'd be lucky to get pumpkin
at this point.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.206
[Gasps]

15:38.208 --> 15:39.541
What?

15:40.610 --> 15:42.043
Dwight?

15:42.045 --> 15:43.878
Why are you such a jerk?

15:43.880 --> 15:46.748
I'm trying to do something
for my wife, and you keep...

15:46.750 --> 15:48.883
I'm barren, Jim.

15:48.885 --> 15:50.018
What?

15:50.020 --> 15:52.254
My trouser hives are void of honey.

15:52.256 --> 15:55.590
I had congress with Angela,
and the child that she bore

15:55.592 --> 15:57.559
did not issue from my loins.

15:57.561 --> 16:00.862
Thought I would be a father,
and instead I am a eunuch,

16:00.864 --> 16:04.599
neutered by my own building.

16:04.601 --> 16:07.636
Is this about the popcorn,
or the X on the ceiling?

16:07.638 --> 16:10.705
Dwight, that was a prank.

16:10.707 --> 16:12.340
You mean you flooded my building

16:12.342 --> 16:14.976
with dangerous electromagnetic
radiation as a prank?

16:14.978 --> 16:16.478
- No.
- That's genius.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.040
That's the best prank you've ever done.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.414
I'll take it.

16:22.685 --> 16:23.685
Andy?

16:23.687 --> 16:25.787
Who is it?

16:25.789 --> 16:27.889
- Um, is this a good time?
- Yeah.

16:27.891 --> 16:31.226
Perfect time, right in
the middle of a rooftop crisis.

16:31.228 --> 16:33.728
Fine, yeah, let me read it.
What do we have here?

16:33.730 --> 16:35.202
Okay...

16:38.001 --> 16:40.101
You've made this very easy for me.

16:40.103 --> 16:41.503
It's unsignable.

16:41.505 --> 16:44.539
Oh.
What, is there something...?

16:44.541 --> 16:48.743
It's inaccurate, dishonest,
and, in a word, dong-water.

16:48.745 --> 16:51.046
Oh, well, perhaps
I could reword some of it...

16:51.048 --> 16:52.047
Here's the thing.

16:52.049 --> 16:53.581
You asked me to do you a favor,

16:53.583 --> 16:55.550
I did it, I read it.

16:55.552 --> 16:59.054
Thank you very much to me for my time.

16:59.056 --> 17:00.755
Good luck with your impossible dream.

17:02.858 --> 17:04.291
All right, then.

17:14.569 --> 17:15.930
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples

17:15.931 --> 17:17.172
years to get pregnant.

17:17.174 --> 17:20.008
Really? How long did it take
you and Pam to conceive?

17:20.010 --> 17:21.009
That doesn't matter.

17:21.011 --> 17:22.544
What position did you use to conceive,

17:22.546 --> 17:24.079
regular
or lady-on-her-back?

17:24.080 --> 17:26.146
You used lady-on-her-back,
didn't you, freak?

17:26.148 --> 17:27.949
Yuck, gross.
Never mind, Jim.

17:27.951 --> 17:32.987
[Crying]

17:32.989 --> 17:38.727
[Sobbing]

17:38.729 --> 17:41.296
British women,
famously over-emotional,

17:41.298 --> 17:43.698
am I right?

17:43.700 --> 17:45.500
I don't think that's Nellie.

17:45.502 --> 17:48.136
- What?
- Oh.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.605
Oh, no, no, no.
It's all right.

17:50.607 --> 17:53.174
Really, it isn't your fault.

17:53.176 --> 17:57.145
No, no. It's...
You were so kind,

17:57.147 --> 17:58.880
and it isn't anything to do with you.

18:00.483 --> 18:03.151
Did you ever think that
because you own the building,

18:03.153 --> 18:05.140
everyone in it,

18:05.141 --> 18:06.621
we're all kind of like your children.

18:06.623 --> 18:09.691
You know, there's a phrase
about that in German,

18:09.693 --> 18:10.892
<i>bilden-kinder,</i>

18:10.894 --> 18:13.495
used almost exclusively
by childless landlords

18:13.497 --> 18:16.197
to console themselves, but now,

18:16.199 --> 18:18.666
I really understand it.

18:18.668 --> 18:23.171
Well, now you have a bus full
of real building-kinder.

18:23.173 --> 18:24.739
- <i>Bilden-kinder.</i>
<i>- </i> Okay.

18:24.741 --> 18:29.277
And they're all dangerously
close to not getting pie.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.713
And there's only one guy
who can save them.

18:31.715 --> 18:33.214
It's not me.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.749
- I agree.
- Oh!

18:34.751 --> 18:36.651
Oh.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.086

20:16.853 --> 20:17.952
