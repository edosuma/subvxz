[dialing]

00:16.614 --> 00:19.516
[man] <i>You've reached Improve your
life Construction. Leave us a message</i>

00:19.518 --> 00:21.353
<i>and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.</i>

00:22.153 --> 00:25.388
- [sighs]
- [woman] <i>The mailbox you have reached is full</i>

00:25.390 --> 00:28.193
<i>and cannot accept
any new messages at this time.</i>

00:29.394 --> 00:31.030
[soft music]

01:12.771 --> 01:14.904
- You want to swipe that again? It didn't go through.
- Yeah.

01:14.906 --> 01:17.609
- [girl] I need to practice...
- Next time I'm leaving you at home.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.114
- But I was just practicing...
- Do you have another card?

01:21.746 --> 01:22.849
It was declined.

01:36.896 --> 01:40.397
[man] <i>Everything you'll need
to know about a person,</i>

01:40.399 --> 01:42.933
<i>you'll learn by reading
their credit report.</i>

01:42.935 --> 01:46.235
<i>Henry Warner, married,
three kids, good job,</i>

01:46.237 --> 01:49.441
<i>two leased cars, mortgage on the
house, currently under construction.</i>

01:50.409 --> 01:52.642
For years
he paid his bills on time,

01:52.644 --> 01:54.881
never left anything
on his credit cards.

01:55.847 --> 01:59.885
And then, six months ago,
he stops making payments,

02:00.653 --> 02:04.457
to the bank, the credit cards,
even to his kid's shrink.

02:05.456 --> 02:08.824
<i>Chances are he lost his job and
his wife doesn't even know it.</i>

02:08.826 --> 02:10.128
Let's go.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.629
[man] <i>Meanwhile,</i>

02:12.631 --> 02:14.800
<i>he's getting crushed
on interest rates.</i>

02:15.600 --> 02:17.534
<i>Bank wants to foreclose
on his home,</i>

02:17.536 --> 02:20.203
<i>the credit card companies
want their money.</i>

02:20.205 --> 02:22.141
<i>He's running on fumes.</i>

02:23.842 --> 02:26.813
Now our job
is to do whatever it takes

02:27.545 --> 02:29.448
to get that money.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.983
You think you're up for it?

02:32.985 --> 02:35.484
In college I lent
my roommate $300.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.853
When he didn't pay it back,
I took a picture of him

02:37.855 --> 02:40.524
in the shower masturbating

02:40.526 --> 02:42.929
and I said I'd post it
on Facebook if he didn't pay up.

02:44.663 --> 02:46.299
You're going to fit right in.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.837
You've got two weeks to close
or I'll find someone else.

02:53.771 --> 02:55.939
Why do you think the wife
doesn't know?

02:55.941 --> 02:58.177
He never stopped paying
for her yoga classes.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.257
- Henry.
- Scott.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.024
- Five bucks and I make it.
- Come on, you can bet more than that.

03:15.026 --> 03:18.263
How about bam $10,000
in severance,

03:19.365 --> 03:22.865
fifteen-year-old scotch
and power tie?

03:22.867 --> 03:26.435
- How about 200k and my job back?
- I wish you could have your job back.

03:26.437 --> 03:28.871
I thought we were saving the
company, not having a fire sale.

03:28.873 --> 03:30.941
Buddy, I originally
signed up to work for you,

03:30.943 --> 03:32.675
not to teach Chinese
people how to do our jobs.

03:32.677 --> 03:33.913
Six months.

03:35.347 --> 03:37.346
I worked here without
a paycheck, six months,

03:37.348 --> 03:40.017
and this is what I get,
a lousy 10k?

03:40.019 --> 03:42.355
Cheap bottle of scotch
and an ugly tie?

03:42.955 --> 03:44.624
Actually the tie was my idea.

03:45.723 --> 03:47.226
[phone rings]

03:47.860 --> 03:51.264
This is Scott.
No, I have time. What's up?

03:54.066 --> 03:56.536
[woman] <i>Your mother
called me stupid.</i>

03:56.935 --> 03:59.602
<i>Your parents
are driving me crazy.</i>

03:59.604 --> 04:01.071
<i>You have to be present...</i>

04:01.073 --> 04:04.774
[woman keeps complaining
indistinctly]

04:04.776 --> 04:06.645
I want you to crush it
while I'm away.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.417
So when they fire me, I can
come back and work for you.

04:11.984 --> 04:16.822
[woman continues speaking]

04:18.023 --> 04:18.992
[Scott] Call me.

04:22.894 --> 04:25.998
[phone rings]

04:37.108 --> 04:40.045
- [harmonic playing]
- Henry.

04:40.812 --> 04:45.014
You know what, I give up, I cannot track
down this fucking contractor anymore.

04:45.016 --> 04:47.017
- I can't live in a disaster zone.
- Mom.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.985
This is... not now,
Trinity, please.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.755
- This is now all on you. You're in charge.
- Mom.

04:51.757 --> 04:56.125
- Trinity, what?
- Mom, stop. Mom, stop. Stop!

04:56.127 --> 04:58.961
- [tires screeching]
- Okay. Okay.

04:58.963 --> 05:03.533
I see it. I see it, Trinity.
Thank you so much.

05:03.535 --> 05:07.036
Honey, you were right.
Mommy just needs a second

05:07.038 --> 05:09.875
and we will get
right back on the road.

05:11.043 --> 05:14.543
[honking]

05:14.545 --> 05:18.350
[harmonica playing]

05:32.497 --> 05:35.867
Okay. Okay.

05:38.903 --> 05:39.969
Okay.

05:39.971 --> 05:41.907
[soft music]

05:58.456 --> 06:00.492
[screams]

06:14.505 --> 06:16.074
[honking]

06:28.987 --> 06:30.921
There got to be somebody
there to loan you the money.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.690
I sympathize with you, but look,
if I don't get a payment

06:34.692 --> 06:38.961
- then we both get in trouble.
- [man] You know you all pay what you owe.

06:38.963 --> 06:42.031
Good afternoon. This is Roy Tucker
from the Beaumont Collection Agency.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.634
I'm not the one
who win up $7,000,

06:44.636 --> 06:46.670
sticking 50s
in the strippers' ass cracks.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.204
[woman]
Don't get upset, Mr. Owens.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.906
Can I call you Albert?

06:49.908 --> 06:52.209
I'm going to call you Albert.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.010
When can you
make a payment?

06:54.012 --> 06:56.812
Next month?
Exactly when next month?

06:56.814 --> 06:59.149
Good afternoon.
This is Roy Tucker. Hello?

06:59.151 --> 07:01.750
No, I can't get off the phone
till I get a date, man.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.553
[man] You know,
you got to give me something.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.555
I mean just help
me out just a little bit.

07:05.557 --> 07:08.024
Calling me a bitch
isn't going to make this better?

07:08.026 --> 07:09.959
- Gary, are you listening to me?
- [man] That guy...

07:09.961 --> 07:13.163
he once convinced a man
to let him bang his wife.

07:13.165 --> 07:15.966
[man] Here's how it's going to happen.
I'm going to call you back in one hour.

07:15.968 --> 07:19.002
And when I do, I want to hear
some magical numbers

07:19.004 --> 07:20.740
because I'm done
fucking with you.

07:29.581 --> 07:30.783
What's with the bike?

07:34.019 --> 07:35.588
All right. Follow me.

07:38.023 --> 07:41.925
[man] <i>Now, you close the case,
you get 30% of whatever you collect.</i>

07:41.927 --> 07:45.728
Do the money dance, do the money
dance, do the money dance.

07:45.730 --> 07:47.897
Of course, I get 50% of that
and then you got to kick back

07:47.899 --> 07:51.166
another 20% to the house
but you get to keep the rest.

07:51.168 --> 07:53.069
Now how much does this guy owe?

07:53.071 --> 07:58.909
- He owes $83567.25.
- Eddie?

07:58.911 --> 08:02.945
That's $25,070
and some change.

08:02.947 --> 08:09.685
Less than 70%,
equalling $7,500.21.

08:09.687 --> 08:11.122
Fuck. What are you, a bookie?

08:12.925 --> 08:15.127
This guy, I love this guy.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.094
Wait. So, that means
when I close 10 cases,

08:19.096 --> 08:21.500
I'll be able to pay
off my student loans.

08:21.966 --> 08:24.769
Hey, kid, bang your head
against the wall.

08:25.202 --> 08:29.040
- I don't understand.
- Go over and bang your head against that wall right there.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.916
- You mean this wall?
- That wall, yeah.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.919
[bangs]

08:42.019 --> 08:43.956
[soft music]

08:58.070 --> 09:00.337
- You're bleeding.
- No, I'm not.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.672
- There's a tack in your head.
- And I can't walk, what's your point?

09:03.674 --> 09:06.876
Hey, you're the enemy and
they want you to think you're

09:06.878 --> 09:08.712
the one who brought this
house of shit down on them.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.814
- That's right.
- If you want that money,

09:10.816 --> 09:12.715
you're going to have to bang
your head against that

09:12.717 --> 09:14.818
- wall a trillion times to get it.
- Tell him.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.752
Sooner or later,
something's going to give

09:16.754 --> 09:19.022
and for your sake,
it better be the wall.

09:19.024 --> 09:21.324
It better be the wall.
You see this?

09:21.326 --> 09:23.028
This grows for bits
right here.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.036
- I can't do it.
- If you drink it,

09:33.038 --> 09:35.972
I will let you jump
on my bed without asking.

09:35.974 --> 09:38.642
Mom, please don't
make them drink that crap.

09:38.644 --> 09:42.212
- It's good for them.
- Last time you gave Matty the shits for two weeks.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.314
- It smells.
- [woman] Melissa!

09:44.316 --> 09:46.016
And does this smell thing stink?

09:46.018 --> 09:48.218
- This stinks.
- No it doesn't.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.387
- [mother] I don't know how you live like this.
- Well...

09:51.389 --> 09:55.057
the idiot contractor has disappeared
off the face of the earth.

09:55.059 --> 09:58.161
- Well, they got deported.
- It's like literally, literally good.

09:58.163 --> 10:01.031
[mother] Oh, that hard water is
going to make your hands dry.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.999
- It's fine, mom.
- You probably could use some moisturizer.

10:04.001 --> 10:06.738
- It's fine, mom.
- I can't eat this.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.372
- I can't eat this.
- Trinity, get your brother out of the car.

10:09.374 --> 10:12.007
- [Trinity] But nana said I have to...
- Go.

10:12.009 --> 10:15.778
I definitely cannot eat...
what even is this?

10:15.780 --> 10:17.213
Hold on. I'll call you
right back. Wish me luck.

10:17.215 --> 10:19.181
Mom, is it really asking
too much for you

10:19.183 --> 10:20.983
to buy me some things that
I can actually eat?

10:20.985 --> 10:22.852
- This alone will kill them.
- What?

10:22.854 --> 10:24.988
That is the only bread
Matty will eat.

10:24.990 --> 10:30.859
Bleached with chlorine
and benzene which causes cancer.

10:30.861 --> 10:34.730
You're trying to kill me? I can't believe
you want me to have cancer and die.

10:34.732 --> 10:37.467
- Can you please just be helpful?
- I thought I was.

10:37.469 --> 10:38.337
Chop.

10:39.904 --> 10:42.040
[phone ringing]

10:44.241 --> 10:46.943
- Hello.
- [man] <i>Hello, this is Travis Parker.</i>

10:46.945 --> 10:50.714
- <i>Is Henry Werner at home?</i>
- Warner, not Werner.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.315
Oh, sorry, ma'am.
I think there's...

10:53.317 --> 10:57.219
- the As look like Es here.
- Hey, stick to the script.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.757
I'm calling on behalf
of the BCC Credit Collection.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.758
I don't care
where you're calling from,

11:02.760 --> 11:05.295
for the thousandth time,
we are on the Do Not Call List.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.964
<i>Yes, ma'am.
This isn't about...</i>

11:07.966 --> 11:10.834
What part of Do Not Call
do you people not understand?

11:10.836 --> 11:13.936
Is... may I please speak
with Henry Warner?

11:13.938 --> 11:15.073
He died.

11:18.976 --> 11:23.215
Wow... Her husband died.

11:28.919 --> 11:31.087
Hey, they only owe 80 grand.

11:31.089 --> 11:33.125
You should hear what they say
when they owe a 100.

11:34.058 --> 11:35.394
Make a note.

11:49.841 --> 11:50.942
That was Bill's desk.

11:54.245 --> 11:57.415
- Do you think I could change desks?
- No.

12:11.863 --> 12:14.033
[soft music]

12:49.500 --> 12:51.834
Did you get
the email I forwarded?

12:51.836 --> 12:54.070
I have stopped
reading those emails.

12:54.072 --> 12:56.406
It's about a group
of college kids

12:56.408 --> 12:58.541
peeing on a girl in a bathtub.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.542
Is there a reward
for a missing child?

13:00.544 --> 13:02.978
I found this one
outside by himself in the car.

13:02.980 --> 13:05.248
- It's been one of those days.
- Matty, take a video.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.050
You just don't want
your kids to think

13:07.052 --> 13:08.884
that getting peed on is normal.

13:08.886 --> 13:09.954
[Karen] I rest my case.

13:12.289 --> 13:16.258
- Hey, did you buy anything that I could actually eat right now?
- Don't start.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.595
- I'm just really famished, to tide me over, a quick one.
- [Karen] No, please.

13:19.597 --> 13:23.199
- Dad, the idiot contractor...
- Please, I need you to take care of that for me.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.468
Well, last I checked
actually I work every day

13:25.470 --> 13:27.536
although if you want
to change jobs

13:27.538 --> 13:29.939
I'm sure we can come to some
type of arrangement.

13:29.941 --> 13:33.443
Okay. Why not you take care
of the kids all day

13:33.445 --> 13:37.479
and I will ignore your phone calls
and pretend I don't have a family?

13:37.481 --> 13:39.150
I will consider your offer.

13:40.317 --> 13:43.085
I was just telling
your wife that kids today,

13:43.087 --> 13:45.588
for whatever demented reason,
think that peeing

13:45.590 --> 13:48.223
on a girl
in a bathtub is normal.

13:48.225 --> 13:50.225
[Karen] My kids
are smarter than that.

13:50.227 --> 13:52.462
[Henry] You're back and forth,
you got to have control.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.263
- Don't encourage her.
- I'm encouraging her to be

13:54.265 --> 13:56.132
a better hockey player.
Back and forth.

13:56.134 --> 13:58.401
I'm saying you don't know
what's going on out there.

13:58.403 --> 14:03.075
Ten-year-olds sexting
naked pictures of themselves.

14:05.076 --> 14:07.109
Actually when I was 11 years
old, I took a polaroid

14:07.111 --> 14:09.478
of myself naked and left it
in the girls' locker at school.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.917
All the good things you have
to look forward to, kids.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.086
- [broken glass]
- Damn it, Trinity.

14:15.552 --> 14:18.153
- Stop playing with that fucking ball!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:18.155 --> 14:20.058
No. Go to your room.

14:23.695 --> 14:27.032
Okay, you guys.
Time to get excited. Why?

14:28.332 --> 14:32.267
Because Jennifer Stinson just tweeted
that she's getting breast implants.

14:32.269 --> 14:35.137
Well, good thing
you are not Jennifer Stinson.

14:35.139 --> 14:38.974
- She is my role model.
- I can just give you $20 so you could buy a better bra.

14:38.976 --> 14:40.709
You are disgusting, dad.

14:40.711 --> 14:42.145
Jesus, Henry.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.048
Forty dollars?

14:44.515 --> 14:46.148
Go set the table.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.152
I am not your slave!

14:49.321 --> 14:53.993
Oh, I wish I could find a man
like you that didn't talk.

14:54.993 --> 14:56.658
You could learn
something from him.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.527
They were talking
about this on Dr. Oz.

14:58.529 --> 15:00.729
All you have to do
is work with him.

15:00.731 --> 15:03.132
I work with him, Mom.
Trust me.

15:03.134 --> 15:04.536
I work with him
more than anyone.

15:09.139 --> 15:14.710
Okay. You don't want
to listen, don't listen. Fine.

15:14.712 --> 15:17.079
[Karen] <i>...stop playing
with that fucking ball.</i>

15:17.081 --> 15:21.050
- <i>Damn it, Trinity. Stop playing with that fucking ball.</i>
- Really? Really?

15:21.052 --> 15:23.288
- <i>Damn it, Trinity. Stop playing with that fucking ball.</i>
- What?

15:24.688 --> 15:27.158
<i>Damn it, Trinity.
Stop playing with that fucking...</i>

15:30.028 --> 15:33.563
She looks for ways
to try and piss me off.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.034
You just can't
let it get to you.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.400
[Karen] You could
have said something.

15:37.402 --> 15:40.203
Well, she hates me
and she's your mother.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.075
This is about you
being there for me.

15:46.311 --> 15:47.947
Real happy I can count on you.

15:54.085 --> 15:57.589
[Melissa] Trinity, did you...
[indistinct]

15:58.255 --> 16:00.323
[Trinity] Sorry. Sorry.

16:00.325 --> 16:02.328
[Melissa] You are disgusting.

16:03.094 --> 16:04.761
I know you are,
I don't like you.

16:04.763 --> 16:05.998
[grunts]

16:07.499 --> 16:09.498
[Melissa] Did you know they cut
the beaks off the chickens

16:09.500 --> 16:12.035
then force-feed them until
they're ready to be slaughtered?

16:12.037 --> 16:14.137
Let's wrap it up. I don't
want you keeping your sister up.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.604
She's asleep.

16:15.606 --> 16:19.278
- Trinity, are you asleep?
- Yes.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.179
Ten more minutes.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.047
I want my own room, dad.

16:25.049 --> 16:26.050
We all do.

16:27.485 --> 16:31.657
Okay, buddy. You know what?

16:33.792 --> 16:36.124
Why not I just move
in here with you?

16:36.126 --> 16:37.195
You know, just the men.

16:38.462 --> 16:41.696
We'll get race car beds, paint
the walls like it's Daytona 500.

16:41.698 --> 16:44.166
Okay. There you are. Locked in.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.370
[sings]

16:50.140 --> 16:51.209
All right.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.484

17:00.250 --> 17:05.124
All right.
Lights on. Lights off.

17:06.522 --> 17:09.794
Lights on. Lights off.

17:12.130 --> 17:15.768

17:39.891 --> 17:42.094
[phone ringing]

17:46.364 --> 17:48.764
Hello, I'm sorry
that your husband is dead.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.102
Hello.

17:51.836 --> 17:53.439
Hi. Hello.

17:54.807 --> 18:00.112
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Yes. Can I just please speak with Henry Warner?

18:00.612 --> 18:03.248
- You got him.
- Henry Robert Warner?

18:03.882 --> 18:05.350
<i>Yeah, one and the same.</i>

18:05.884 --> 18:08.653
<i>Oh, wow. You're still alive.</i>

18:09.520 --> 18:13.523
Yeah. That's right.
Last time I checked. Not dead.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.859
This is Travis Parker.
Sir, I'm calling on behalf

18:16.861 --> 18:18.928
of the Beaumont Credit
Collection Agency.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.631
For quality assurances, I have
to tell you that this call

18:21.633 --> 18:24.167
may be monitored and any
information that you give

18:24.169 --> 18:25.637
may be used
to collect a debt.

18:27.204 --> 18:30.308
Why is it that when batteries die,
people don't throw out the old batteries?

18:30.942 --> 18:33.176
Instead they put them
in a drawer with the new ones,

18:33.178 --> 18:36.312
like magically somehow now
they're going to work?

18:36.314 --> 18:38.780
Now I can't figure out
which are the old ones

18:38.782 --> 18:41.119
and which ones are the new ones
and it's very annoying.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.823
<i>Sir, do you understand
the reason I'm calling?</i>

18:45.923 --> 18:48.324
- I owe you money.
- <i>Yes, sir, A lot of money.</i>

18:48.326 --> 18:51.494
- I don't have it.
- Well, sir, may I remind you

18:51.496 --> 18:54.930
that failure to make a payment will
result in the immediate reposition...

18:54.932 --> 18:56.932
You can read that entire
old script to me all night,

18:56.934 --> 18:58.934
I'm still not going to have
the money. Are you open

18:58.936 --> 19:00.838
to having a real conversation,
I'm open to doing that.

19:01.772 --> 19:04.774
- I don't know.
- You're not sure you're going to have a real conversation?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.742
Listen. I'm new here.
And I called earlier

19:07.744 --> 19:11.413
<i>and your wife said that you died so I didn't
even know that you'd pick up the phone.</i>

19:11.415 --> 19:13.982
<i>I was a little surprised but...
and I'm new here so I don't...</i>

19:13.984 --> 19:17.385
I said that already. There's just...
there's a lot of stuff

19:17.387 --> 19:19.524
- on my mind and I'm a little confused.
- <i>Travis,</i>

19:20.224 --> 19:21.259
take a deep breath.

19:22.326 --> 19:23.895
- <i>Deep breath?</i>
- Take a deep breath, Travis.

19:27.365 --> 19:29.966
<i>Just take a deep breath.
It gets you through it.</i>

19:29.968 --> 19:32.867
- Yes sir.
- <i>Normally I would hang the phone up,</i>

19:32.869 --> 19:35.837
but I have had a shitty day and it
sounds like you're having a shitty day

19:35.839 --> 19:38.607
and there's no point both of us having
a shitty day so I'm going to help.

19:38.609 --> 19:39.877
Thanks.

19:40.877 --> 19:43.915
You need your money,
I want to pay.

19:44.949 --> 19:47.219
- <i>That's great.</i>
- Just not tonight.

19:48.286 --> 19:50.553
- Tomorrow?
- No, probably not tomorrow, Travis,

19:50.555 --> 19:52.787
because the assholes
that I work for...

19:52.789 --> 19:55.958
worked for just sold
the company to the Chinese.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.462
Chinese like the China Chinese?

19:58.997 --> 20:02.597
Yes, Travis,
the China Chinese.

20:02.599 --> 20:06.337
Yeah. Sweatshops.
Kids eating dogs.

20:07.571 --> 20:08.839
The China Chinese.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.445
Good night, Travis.

20:20.917 --> 20:21.886
Good work.

20:22.854 --> 20:24.756
It never gets any easier.

20:26.457 --> 20:28.694
The hardest part
is keeping them on the phone.

20:51.382 --> 20:54.083
[Karen] Well, I could quote
you an hourly rate

20:54.085 --> 20:57.719
or just one price
for the whole job,

20:57.721 --> 20:59.721
whatever makes you
more comfortable.

20:59.723 --> 21:02.691
I am here to provide
peace of mind for you

21:02.693 --> 21:05.864
now that it's time
to divest yourself

21:06.596 --> 21:07.798
of these kind of things.

21:08.932 --> 21:11.536
I think you're going to be
really happy with my work.

21:13.805 --> 21:18.039
Um... I just have to drop
the kids off at school

21:18.041 --> 21:19.644
and then I could be over there.

21:22.613 --> 21:25.847
Thank you for calling.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.918
I really look forward
to working with you.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.489

21:31.855 --> 21:35.993

22:08.992 --> 22:10.892
[Karen] Okay, you guys,
come on let's go, please.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.865
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Oh, come on. Leave that.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.843
- Gross. I'm not eating that.
- You ate these yesterday.

22:27.845 --> 22:30.949
I was also forced to drink
breast milk until I was two.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.182
- Tickle torture.
- Stop, stop, stop.

22:34.184 --> 22:37.085
I can't hear you, I'm holding
a laughter. Tickle torture.

22:37.087 --> 22:40.456
- I can't hear...
- Please, stop.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.060
You're lucky I love you.

22:45.863 --> 22:47.595
That's an unborn baby.

22:47.597 --> 22:49.467
Yeah, it is.

22:50.867 --> 22:52.671
That's a good unborn baby.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.069
I can't live in this house
one more minute.

22:55.071 --> 22:58.075
- Hmm.
- Dad, stop.

23:01.945 --> 23:05.116
I can almost hear it crying. Hm.

23:06.517 --> 23:09.218
- I need some cash.
- Oh, me too.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.519
- [Karen] You don't need cash.
- Huh, funny.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.823
- Sara's mom is picking me up.
- I thought I was driving you.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.990
You thought wrong.
Love you, daddy.

23:15.992 --> 23:16.861
Bye.

23:19.596 --> 23:21.463
Why doesn't she talk
to you that way?

23:21.465 --> 23:23.434
Said you want them girls, so...

23:25.068 --> 23:27.105
- I need some money.
- That's romantic.

23:28.005 --> 23:29.838
We need to pay
the credit card bills

23:29.840 --> 23:32.574
and I have to buy supplies
for new client so...

23:32.576 --> 23:33.912
New client?
You have a new client?

23:35.212 --> 23:37.011
- You're not the only one with a job.
- That's good, helpful.

23:37.013 --> 23:38.913
- Who's the client?
- No. I don't want to talk about it.

23:38.915 --> 23:40.649
I'm going to jinx it.
I will tell you tonight.

23:40.651 --> 23:42.617
- Got a $20.
- You've got $50 and $20.

23:42.619 --> 23:44.622
I will take them both.
Thank you.

23:45.957 --> 23:48.056
If you're not nice to me,
I'm going to cash in our SkyMiles

23:48.058 --> 23:49.959

I might not take you with me.

want me to throw anything out.

God forbid,
I throw something important out.

- Of course.
- So I told them come and get it.

25:44.275 --> 25:46.909

- Well, of course, no one showed up.

25:46.911 --> 25:50.981
- No, no.
- Now I'm warning you.

25:52.616 --> 25:55.619
- We were married for 50 years.
- I can't even imagine that.

25:56.252 --> 25:59.654
For the first
few years it was good,

25:59.656 --> 26:03.392
it really was. And the last
few years were pretty good too.

- I can work with this.
- I mean, I just don't know what you need

26:15.306 --> 26:17.206
or anything to do all this.

26:17.208 --> 26:20.808
That is why I am here.

I'm not tan.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.859
[music in the headphones]

31:06.163 --> 31:10.132
Touch it and you die.
I swear I'll kill you.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.267
- Let go!
- I told you not to touch it.

31:12.269 --> 31:14.635
Okay. Come on.
Cut it out. Cut it out.

31:14.637 --> 31:18.606
- I told her not to touch it.
- Stop it. Quit it. I said quit it.

31:18.608 --> 31:21.343
- No, you want to kill your sister?
- Yes.

31:21.345 --> 31:23.679
- Okay. You know what, here, take it.
- What?

31:23.681 --> 31:26.047
- You want to kill her. It makes you happy, kill her.
- No!

31:26.049 --> 31:28.049
I'm so sorry, Trinity,
it's what Melissa wants,

31:28.051 --> 31:30.151
so you'll have to just hush.
Take the knife.

31:30.153 --> 31:31.152
- Here. Take it.
- No, Mom. No.

31:31.154 --> 31:33.023
Melissa, take the knife.

31:35.491 --> 31:36.627
You missed your chance.

31:38.061 --> 31:39.995
You're so weird.

31:39.997 --> 31:42.634
You want to kill your sister,
I'm here for you.

31:53.477 --> 31:56.178
- It's a lot of water, man.
- I'm a Yuride driver.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.149
Got to have water
for the customers.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.253
- And you're in the back.
- What?

32:07.124 --> 32:08.690
By the way,
don't pick me up.

32:08.692 --> 32:11.058
I have a date
with Ian after school.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.163
Wait a minute.

32:22.306 --> 32:24.208
- Love you mom.
- Love you, too.

32:31.781 --> 32:32.716
Are you my Yuride?

32:34.384 --> 32:35.987
You're in the back.

32:37.554 --> 32:38.957
Yes.

32:40.790 --> 32:43.592
Can you believe that?
This is my first day on the job.

32:43.594 --> 32:47.432
- Congrats.
- You're my first passenger.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.065
You want me to move the seat up,
I can move the seat up.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.100
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Okay.

32:52.102 --> 32:54.072
So, less chatter, more driving.
Here we go.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.043
- Want water? I can get you water.
- I'm fine, thank you.

33:00.109 --> 33:02.679
Yeah, I used to be a marketing
executive over Borderline Capital.

33:03.313 --> 33:06.985
Ten years. Yeah. Good job.

33:08.184 --> 33:10.485
But at some point
you just got to move on

33:10.487 --> 33:13.488
or they move you on. You know.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.489
I should've seen the writing
on the wall when they gave

33:15.491 --> 33:17.825
my promotion to this little
shit from business school.

33:17.827 --> 33:20.128
That's some tough shit, man.

33:20.130 --> 33:23.331
Yeah, it's tough shit.
That is some tough shit.

33:23.333 --> 33:26.334
Can you please
turn the radio on?

33:26.336 --> 33:29.336
I thought the company
was in a transition phase, yeah.

33:29.338 --> 33:31.305
Transition you out phase.

33:31.307 --> 33:33.542
God, I'm in this car.
It's too creepy.

33:33.544 --> 33:36.077
They couldn't even operate
a copy machine at the beginning

33:36.079 --> 33:38.180
now he's driving a Beemer,
banging supermodels

33:38.182 --> 33:40.548
and flying to China.
I'm the one without a job.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.620
Excuse me. What I meant to say
was, can you shut the fuck up?

33:44.387 --> 33:45.288
Yeah.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.190
[sighs] Yeah.

33:49.192 --> 33:52.062
Shred. Yeah, shred.

33:53.163 --> 33:56.198
My daughter, she can wear
anything that she wants

33:56.200 --> 33:58.702
and she can stay up
as late as she wants.

34:00.671 --> 34:03.771
- Same.
- It's not like I'm like those other anal retentive mothers

34:03.773 --> 34:06.107
that dress their daughters
like country club Barbie dolls

34:06.109 --> 34:09.210
then they want their daughters
to grow up and be a little

34:09.213 --> 34:11.081
country club bitches
like they are.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.815
- What did you just...
- Oh, I don't know.

34:14.818 --> 34:17.585
Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.724
Oh, God.
Okay, wait, it's here.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.592
Um...

34:23.226 --> 34:26.460
I wasn't paying attention.
I am so sorry.

34:26.463 --> 34:28.795
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- I don't need it

34:28.797 --> 34:31.536
to tell me that I was married
for 50 years,

34:32.536 --> 34:36.074
it's just a piece of paper,
that's all.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.377
[slow music]

34:52.856 --> 34:55.190
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:55.192 --> 34:57.561
We're going
to 33 Beaumont Street.

34:58.295 --> 34:59.363
You're in the back.

35:00.797 --> 35:06.501
Okay, now I want
you to work me out...

35:06.503 --> 35:07.872
Jesus Christ.

35:09.206 --> 35:12.606
Well, huh,
this is interesting.

35:12.608 --> 35:15.376
- [man]You two know each other?
- Yeah, this is my son-in-law.

35:15.378 --> 35:18.715
Don't feel like you have to tip
him just because I know him.

35:21.485 --> 35:23.488
Mm-hmm. Drive.

35:29.693 --> 35:32.196
Hey, Mr. Yuride,

35:34.965 --> 35:37.168
why don't you go steal
somebody else's job?

35:43.773 --> 35:47.842
- [man 1]Sir Robert...
- [man 2] what kind of the fucked up name is Bosom?

35:47.844 --> 35:51.713
What the... get
this bike out of here?

35:51.715 --> 35:53.981
For the night time,
this is not a fucking bike.

35:53.983 --> 35:57.686
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't
want to get it stolen again.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.287
Do I look like
I give a flying fuck?

36:00.289 --> 36:02.289
You're close to closing yet?

36:02.291 --> 36:03.858
I feel like maybe
if I went to their house...

36:03.860 --> 36:06.894
No, they're lining up
bags of cash for the kid.

36:06.896 --> 36:08.829
- He's doing great.
- Really, he's making progress.

36:08.831 --> 36:10.835
Nowhere to put
the cash he's bringing in.

36:11.835 --> 36:14.269
Get on the goddamn phone.

36:14.271 --> 36:15.869
Get back to work everyone.

36:15.871 --> 36:18.208
[crying] I hate this job.

36:21.545 --> 36:23.847
[slow music]

36:40.697 --> 36:43.030
[laughs]

36:43.032 --> 36:48.269
[Karen] I cannot believe you come
out with new ways to embarrass me.

36:48.271 --> 36:50.905
Henry likes it,
don't you, Henry?

36:50.907 --> 36:53.244
- Love it.
- Oh, yeah. I think it's sexy.

36:54.277 --> 36:56.778
I think it's inappropriate.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.545
It'll look
great in the crop top.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.914
I'm sure
if you're a teenager.

37:00.916 --> 37:03.487
- <i>I think it's sexy.</i>
- Well, we're glad you feel that way.

37:04.521 --> 37:05.923
[both laughing]

37:07.791 --> 37:09.758
No.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.959
- Don't overreact.
- Yeah, here we go.

37:11.961 --> 37:13.927
- How could you have done this?
- [mother] Calm down.

37:13.929 --> 37:16.530
- <i>I think it's sexy.</i>
- Just relax.

37:16.532 --> 37:18.800
- Who did what?
- <i>I think it's sexy.</i>

37:18.802 --> 37:21.836
- Dad...
- Oh.

37:21.838 --> 37:25.876
Oh, oh. Okay, that's nice.
Can you take that out?

37:33.684 --> 37:35.617
It's a very big deal
and you don't understand

37:35.619 --> 37:36.985
your grandmother
shouldn't have done it.

37:36.987 --> 37:38.853
- Take it out.
- It's not her fault.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.854
- It's her fault.
- No, we had fun together.

37:40.856 --> 37:42.657
- [Karen] It's, believe me.
- [Melissa] No, it's not.

37:42.659 --> 37:44.758
- I decided to do it.
- This is not the time.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.927
- Take out the belly ring.
- No. No.

37:46.929 --> 37:48.898
It is my body and I am choosing
what I want to do with this.

37:51.702 --> 37:55.336
- Hi.
- So take that belly ring out of your body.

37:55.338 --> 37:57.972
- No, Mom.
- Take it out of your body.

37:57.974 --> 38:01.045
- I think I got the wrong house.
- Take it out. Melissa...

38:02.713 --> 38:07.081
- Take it out.
- You are crazy and you ruin everything, Mom.

38:07.083 --> 38:11.485
You ruin
everything and I hate you.

38:11.487 --> 38:13.723
Melissa,
come back here right now!

38:14.925 --> 38:17.659
- [Melissa] I hate you.
- [shuts the door violently]

38:17.661 --> 38:19.561
What on earth makes you think
you can do that?

38:19.563 --> 38:22.996
I am her mother.
You are not her mother.

38:22.998 --> 38:27.369
I am so sorry for once again
ruining everything.

38:27.371 --> 38:31.572
- I think it's fine.
- Henry, when she decides to apologize to me,

38:31.574 --> 38:33.043
tell her to give me a call.

38:39.081 --> 38:42.016
- That's just a belly ring.
- I can't believe you're siding with her.

38:42.018 --> 38:44.885
- I'm not taking sides.
- When I say something, you have to stand with me.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.889
We are married. You have to
stand with me. Stand together.

38:47.891 --> 38:51.425
Us, them.
She's already ruined my life.

38:51.427 --> 38:54.028
I can't believe she's going
to ruin my children's.

38:54.030 --> 38:56.130
You're overreacting.
No one's life is getting ruined.

38:56.132 --> 38:58.902
You never agree with my mother.
Now you're taking her side?

39:05.074 --> 39:06.509
You never
agree with my mother.

39:07.077 --> 39:08.746
You never agree with my mom.

39:11.882 --> 39:12.950
I lost my job.

39:13.817 --> 39:15.016
Don't even joke about that.

39:15.018 --> 39:16.586
I lost my job.

39:18.655 --> 39:22.626
I totally lost my job
and I told your mom.

39:24.027 --> 39:24.961
What?

39:26.996 --> 39:29.496
- You told my fucking mother.
- I didn't mean to tell your mom.

39:29.498 --> 39:31.932
She got in the back
and so she found out.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.969
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wasn't going to tell anybody.

39:34.971 --> 39:37.671
I didn't expect your mother to get in
the back of the damn Yuride, that's all.

39:37.673 --> 39:40.941
- What were you doing in a Yuride?
- I was driving the thing.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.811
I was... I had the job,
I lost the job,

39:43.813 --> 39:47.749
I had a second job
and I probably lost that job.

39:47.751 --> 39:51.452
She got in the back when I had
that job... briefly had that job.

39:51.454 --> 39:52.954
She got in and started
kissing some guy.

39:52.956 --> 39:54.822
You are driving a fucking cab?

39:54.824 --> 39:58.525
- It's a Yuride. Yuride!
- Oh, my God.

39:58.527 --> 40:01.028
I didn't sign up to marry
a fucking Uber driver.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.630
- Yuride actually.
- What?

40:02.632 --> 40:04.231
It's Yuride.
It's a different company.

40:04.233 --> 40:07.601
It's temporary
until I figure some shit out.

40:07.603 --> 40:09.771
I can't believe
this is happening.

40:09.773 --> 40:12.005
Great. That's good.
Take another happy pill.

40:12.007 --> 40:15.242
why don't we all take a pill?
One big happy fucking pill party.

40:15.244 --> 40:18.746
Just can't believe this.
This is why these were invented,

40:18.748 --> 40:22.050
so, yeah! I'm going to have
a big fucking party!

40:22.052 --> 40:25.220
If you weren't high all the
time, I would've told you sooner.

40:25.222 --> 40:28.590
- Yeah, that's it. I'm a junkie, is that what you're saying?
- No.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.525
[Melissa] And that's one way
to New York, correct?

40:31.527 --> 40:34.931
And how much for first class?
Sorry, can you say that again?

40:36.166 --> 40:38.766
Sorry, you keep on breaking up.
One more time.

40:38.768 --> 40:41.970
- [continue fighting in the back]
- Can you hold my reservation?

40:41.972 --> 40:43.841
- [phone ringing]
- Okay. Thank you. Bye.

40:46.909 --> 40:48.075
You've got Melissa.

40:48.077 --> 40:50.010
Oh, Melissa. Hi.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.516
- Is Henry Warner...
- <i>Dad!</i>

40:54.951 --> 41:00.588
- Dad, phone.
- <i>Melissa... hey, Melissa, you're still there?</i>

41:00.590 --> 41:03.023
- They're fighting.
- <i>Just trust me I know it's such</i>

41:03.025 --> 41:05.860
that your parents are fighting
and it might not seem fair but...

41:05.862 --> 41:07.896
<i>Fair? You're talking about fair.</i>

41:07.898 --> 41:11.032
<i>What's not fair is that chickens
spend their whole life in cages</i>

41:11.034 --> 41:14.235
- <i>just waiting to be killed.</i>
- But those are chickens.

41:14.237 --> 41:17.974
You're just like
everybody else. It's okay.

41:18.942 --> 41:20.911
<i>That's why I'm leaving here
and moving to New York.</i>

41:23.780 --> 41:25.082
No personal calls at work.

41:26.615 --> 41:29.583
You take downers
so technically you're laid out

41:29.585 --> 41:32.052
- half the fucking time.
- Go fuck yourself.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.923
Good option, you're not fucking me,
me fucking myself might be a better option.

41:34.925 --> 41:37.191
Oh, you know what?
yeah, it's me, it's me,

41:37.193 --> 41:40.327
I'm the problem, right, me
and my pills but you know what?

41:40.329 --> 41:43.063
Let's just get rid of them.
Let's get rid of all of them.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.233
You know, oh, these, Finpecia.

41:45.235 --> 41:47.969
Oh, God, I hope you're going
to get bald, baby.

41:47.971 --> 41:50.771
No. All right. Fine.
We'll throw the pills out, that's great.

41:50.773 --> 41:53.575
What do you got here?
Alprazolam, some kind of...

41:53.577 --> 41:56.213
Oh, look, empty already.
Good for you.

41:58.047 --> 42:02.083
Okay. Deep breath.
You're mad.

42:02.085 --> 42:03.985
I get it. You're mad.

42:03.987 --> 42:06.920
Do you have any idea
how disgusting it is

42:06.922 --> 42:10.090
to have to find out my mother
walked in on you beating off?

42:10.092 --> 42:11.828
Any idea?

42:12.929 --> 42:14.999
[soft music over headphones]

42:29.012 --> 42:30.748
[slow music]

42:33.382 --> 42:35.919
[Karen speaking indistinctly]

42:38.088 --> 42:42.927
Where are my keys?
Who took my keys?

42:43.927 --> 42:46.293
Everyone take my things
and they never put them back!

42:46.295 --> 42:49.697
- All right. Just...
- No one respects anything of mine.

42:49.699 --> 42:51.668
Just take a breath, okay.

42:52.702 --> 42:55.802
I can't breathe.
I do everything for this family,

42:55.804 --> 42:58.271
I do it all.
I sit at fucking ice rinks

42:58.273 --> 43:01.208
because your daughter
wanted to play hockey.

43:01.210 --> 43:03.677
No one puts anything back
where it belongs.

43:03.679 --> 43:05.313
No one wants to replace
the toilet paper.

43:05.315 --> 43:08.282
How hard is it to replace
the toilet paper roll?

43:08.284 --> 43:10.385
Where are my keys?

43:10.387 --> 43:13.021
You don't need your keys.
Come to bed, we'll talk.

43:13.023 --> 43:16.758
Why is there a sandwich
in the couch?

43:16.760 --> 43:19.730
[grunts] Where are my keys?

43:26.202 --> 43:32.076
Of course they are exactly where I put them.
I should've found them but I couldn't

43:33.710 --> 43:37.748
because I am losing my mind!
I am done! [grunts]

43:45.054 --> 43:48.956
I can't do this.
[indistinct]

43:48.958 --> 43:52.059
- [car engine starts]
- Where are you going?

43:52.061 --> 43:53.396
- Get away from me.
- Hey.

43:57.032 --> 44:00.903
Karen, get out of the car.
Honey, get...

44:01.938 --> 44:05.909
stop the car. Damn it,
can we just... can we talk?

44:06.943 --> 44:08.943
- [horn]
- Get out of my way.

44:08.945 --> 44:10.780
- Get out of my way.
- Okay.

44:12.782 --> 44:14.218
Oh.

44:19.088 --> 44:21.054
Oh...

44:21.056 --> 44:22.959
[tension music]

44:28.097 --> 44:31.134
[moaning]

44:46.782 --> 44:48.483
- Oh, my God.
- I'm fine.

44:48.485 --> 44:51.918
- I'm fine.
- Dad! You're bleeding.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.155
- No, I'm...
- Oh, my God. There's so much blood.

44:54.157 --> 44:56.791
- I'm calling 911.
- No. We're not calling 911.

44:56.793 --> 44:58.325
Yes, you are going
to the hospital.

44:58.327 --> 45:00.128
- I can't go to the hospital.
- It's everywhere.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.130
No, no. It's fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

45:02.132 --> 45:04.134
I'm calling 911.
I'm getting you ice, okay.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.068
Why the hell is the ice
in this house?

45:07.070 --> 45:08.836
Calm down.
The kids will hear you.

45:08.838 --> 45:10.972
It looks and feels
worse than it is.

45:10.974 --> 45:12.807
You want me to calm
down when my father's dying?

45:12.809 --> 45:14.175
- I'm not dying.
- Put this on your face.

45:14.177 --> 45:16.010
- Oh.
- Watch it. I'm sorry.

45:16.012 --> 45:17.979
Did she do this to you?
if she did,

45:17.981 --> 45:20.014
- this is attempted murder.
- It's an accident.

45:20.016 --> 45:22.385
- It's an accident.
- How is it an accident?

45:24.920 --> 45:27.390
- It's fine. We're fine.
- Oh, my God.

45:28.291 --> 45:31.391
If I lost my job, he'll be
the first person I told.

45:31.393 --> 45:35.463
I would've told him and...
how can he not tell me?

45:35.465 --> 45:37.063
Stop eating that.

45:37.065 --> 45:38.132
You're not even listening to me.

45:38.134 --> 45:40.501
I am, but you can say it

45:40.503 --> 45:43.170
- without stuffing your face.
- What?

45:43.172 --> 45:45.173
If you're going to be back
on the market again,

45:45.175 --> 45:46.243
you got to stay in shape.

45:46.976 --> 45:48.342
You wanted this to happen.

45:48.344 --> 45:50.378
Don't be ridiculous.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.046
I stopped wishing
for this years ago.

45:53.048 --> 45:54.884
Oh.

46:05.894 --> 46:06.764
[soft music]

46:09.032 --> 46:12.967
- [knocking]
- [mother] Honey! Honey, open the door.

46:12.969 --> 46:14.438
It was just a joke.

46:25.581 --> 46:27.049
Are you guys getting a divorce?

46:28.117 --> 46:29.920
What? No, no.

46:33.056 --> 46:33.956
Good night, dad.

46:35.023 --> 46:37.527
[soft music continues]

[Henry]
Lights on. Lights off.

47:39.054 --> 47:42.523
- Hello.
- [Travis] <i>Mrs. Warner, this is Travis Parker.</i>

47:42.525 --> 47:44.925
<i>I spoke to you once before
and it's really important</i>

47:44.927 --> 47:47.327
- <i>that I talk to your husband.</i>
- Travis?

47:47.329 --> 47:49.195
How did you get this number?

47:49.197 --> 47:50.398
Your daughter gave it to me.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.001
Well, of course she did.

47:53.001 --> 47:57.338
[sighs] Travis, right now
I'm smoking a joint

47:57.340 --> 47:59.273
and my husband isn't here so...

47:59.275 --> 48:01.575
<i>I used to wake and bake.</i>

48:01.577 --> 48:05.179
<i>I can't smoke weed anymore, it
makes me a little bit paranoid.</i>

48:05.181 --> 48:09.115
Travis, I just got my period

48:09.117 --> 48:10.485
and I'm having
really bad cramps.

48:11.954 --> 48:16.090
I just found out two hours ago that
my husband is lying to me so...

48:16.092 --> 48:18.394
Yeah, it's a little weird.
I guess I knew before you.

48:19.594 --> 48:21.430
Apparently, I'm the only one
that didn't know.

48:38.981 --> 48:39.682
[moaning]

48:54.764 --> 48:56.066
[burps]

49:01.637 --> 49:03.371
You need to take us to school.

49:03.373 --> 49:05.206
- [phone ringing]
- What?

49:05.208 --> 49:07.041
You need to take us to school.

49:07.043 --> 49:08.275
I know. Let's go.

49:08.277 --> 49:10.276
We didn't have breakfast.

49:10.278 --> 49:12.146
We'll stop at Dunkin Donuts.

49:12.148 --> 49:15.085
[phone continues ringing]

49:16.619 --> 49:18.322
[grunts] God.

49:21.023 --> 49:23.289
Wait till he disconnects
the cellphone.

49:23.291 --> 49:25.628
[Travis grunts] Shit.

49:42.545 --> 49:43.447
[slow music]

50:06.702 --> 50:08.138
Please, please... [cries]

50:10.639 --> 50:14.377
I want you to come home... now.

50:15.811 --> 50:18.347
- I will.
- <i>I love you.</i>

50:19.181 --> 50:22.785
I just have to help nana out
for a couple more days, okay?

50:23.652 --> 50:27.088
I miss you. Please, come home.

50:27.090 --> 50:31.495
Hey, is that mommy?
Here, let me talk. Karen.

50:34.563 --> 50:36.199
[slow music continues]

50:39.601 --> 50:41.469
[phone ringing]

50:41.471 --> 50:43.340
[grunts]

50:53.215 --> 50:55.518
Wow. Look at you.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.188
I know.

50:59.889 --> 51:04.557
- I'm turning 70 next month.
- Congratulations.

51:04.559 --> 51:06.392
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

51:06.394 --> 51:08.097
Twenty five years.

51:09.164 --> 51:12.532
Twenty five fucking years
of chasing down junkies,

51:12.534 --> 51:15.836
squeezing nickels and dimes
out of lying assholes

51:15.838 --> 51:18.175
and now I'm getting squeezed
out of this shithole.

51:19.775 --> 51:20.644
You know what?

51:21.911 --> 51:23.443
That's fine.

51:23.445 --> 51:25.679
It's real fucking fine.

51:25.681 --> 51:28.617
And you know why?
Because I'm free.

51:29.619 --> 51:34.091
And you guys... you guys
are still stuck in this shit.

51:35.757 --> 51:38.394
Don't say I didn't tell you.

51:40.262 --> 51:42.264
- [door shuts]
- He didn't close.

52:01.851 --> 52:05.586
[laughs] I envy you,
no really I do.

52:05.588 --> 52:09.956
You probably don't have
any idea how good you got it.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.758
Mr. Warner,
you need to listen to me.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.427
<i>Go anywhere you want,</i>

52:13.429 --> 52:15.132
have sex with anyone you want.

52:16.199 --> 52:22.202
Oh, Travis... I don't even
remember the last time I had sex.

52:22.204 --> 52:24.771
<i>Mr. Warner, that doesn't matter.
Unless you pay your bills,</i>

52:24.773 --> 52:27.907
they're going to take away
your house, repo all your cars.

52:27.909 --> 52:30.311
Your credit will be so fucked,
you won't be able to open

52:30.313 --> 52:32.713
a cellphone account, okay?
And top of that,

52:32.715 --> 52:34.847
guess what, your family's going to
be living on the fucking streets,

52:34.849 --> 52:35.851
do you really want that?

52:36.952 --> 52:39.286
I lost my job, Travis.

52:39.288 --> 52:40.856
I didn't even tell my wife.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.726
I... I don't know.

52:44.726 --> 52:47.830
I guess I thought everything
was going to work out somehow.

52:48.597 --> 52:49.833
I didn't want them to worry.

52:51.099 --> 52:54.668
[sighs] I didn't want them to
worry because I'm supposed to be

52:54.670 --> 52:56.336
the guy who takes care
of things like that.

52:56.338 --> 52:57.773
It's my job to protect them,

52:58.873 --> 53:00.176
so I didn't tell them.

53:01.911 --> 53:03.380
Dumbest thing I could have done

53:04.512 --> 53:06.679
- and I did it.
- <i>Mr. Warner,</i>

53:06.681 --> 53:08.916
unless you want your daughters
to become washed-up strippers

53:08.918 --> 53:09.983
banging dudes for food stamps...

53:09.985 --> 53:11.885
I'm back here... Matty...

53:11.887 --> 53:13.720
I suggest you get
a new fucking job...

53:13.722 --> 53:15.356
I can't just start over!

53:15.358 --> 53:16.893
You haven't even fucking tried!

53:17.994 --> 53:20.026
Matty, come back here.

53:20.028 --> 53:21.463
Sorry.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.700
- [Henry] All I asked was that you watch them.
- I was watching them.

53:26.702 --> 53:29.869
You weren't, if you were,
this would not have happened.

53:29.871 --> 53:32.706
I can't keep track
of them every second, dad.

53:32.708 --> 53:34.974
- Can you not argue with me, please?
- Stop fighting.

53:34.976 --> 53:36.342
- We're not fighting.
- Stop.

53:36.344 --> 53:37.945
I don't want to fight

53:37.947 --> 53:39.746
if we could just be quiet
and let me think.

53:39.748 --> 53:41.414
- [Trinity] You want this?
- [Henry] No.

53:41.416 --> 53:43.516
You're going to have to grow up

53:43.518 --> 53:45.688
stop making excuses
and take some responsibility.

53:47.389 --> 53:51.560
Like what? Losing your job
and not telling anybody?

53:54.030 --> 53:57.563
You were living on fumes
and you didn't even know it.

53:57.565 --> 53:59.967
You have to have
your own money.

53:59.969 --> 54:04.003
- You can never count on...
- Someone else to do that for you, I know,

54:04.005 --> 54:06.706
and I have been working,
so this is not helping me.

54:06.708 --> 54:09.043
Plus, you're not having sex.

54:09.045 --> 54:11.644
Why don't you just
tell everyone at the bar?

54:11.646 --> 54:14.750
Oh, you can't see
how fucked up your life is.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.257
The guy at the other end
of the bar sent these over.

54:23.793 --> 54:29.362
Mm-hmm. Well, thanks.
[laughs]

54:29.364 --> 54:33.969
If he's looking for cougars,
he can bag this big old cat. Hm.

Yes.

55:16.378 --> 55:17.880
Yes!

55:21.951 --> 55:23.385
[sighs] Okay.

55:35.030 --> 55:36.032
I'm sorry.

55:37.599 --> 55:41.534
- Don't worry about it.
- I overreacted, sweetheart.

55:41.536 --> 55:43.970
You were right about me and I
was wrong and we're frustrated...

55:43.972 --> 55:49.008
Dad, it's okay.
Really. I get it.

55:49.010 --> 55:51.380
Here. Have these
before they get cold.

55:56.152 --> 55:59.519
What? Is this tofu?
I don't like tofu.

55:59.521 --> 56:02.088
- It's not tofu.
- [Henry] Did she poison it?

56:02.090 --> 56:03.826
[Trinity] No.

56:04.460 --> 56:05.992
All right.
No, I'm going to eat this.

56:05.994 --> 56:09.028
By the way, you have
a job interview today.

56:09.030 --> 56:10.132
No. No, I don't.

56:11.967 --> 56:12.836

Not that is too bad either...

[mother moans]

56:36.025 --> 56:37.594
I hope you use protection.

56:37.992 --> 56:38.927
Are you kidding?

56:40.094 --> 56:43.165
At my age you just pray
you don't get cervical cancer.

I got you the interview,
it's your job to do the rest.

57:21.871 --> 57:24.237
- You can't lie to people.
- You lie to people.

57:24.239 --> 57:27.139
Yep, look what that got me in.
You shouldn't drink coffee...

57:27.141 --> 57:29.575
You are drinking coffee
right now.

57:29.577 --> 57:31.744
- It's not helpful.
- I am like a free therapist...

57:49.965 --> 57:52.199
- Right.
- You probably don't know this,

57:52.201 --> 57:55.601
but your dad
was a rockstar at work.

57:55.603 --> 57:58.005
Wow. Dad, you never
tell me these things.

57:58.007 --> 58:00.139
Ah, well, you know, sometimes
I don't tell you everything.

58:00.141 --> 58:02.075
- God, you're so humble.
- That's right.

58:02.077 --> 58:04.644
Wait. I have a question.
If he's so awesome,

58:04.646 --> 58:07.483
- why did you fire him?
- [Scott laughs]

58:09.117 --> 58:12.151

that in Chinese?

- [phone ringing]

58:14.956 --> 58:16.092

59:32.400 --> 59:36.670
We were celebrating. Frank had
just published his first novel.

59:36.672 --> 59:38.608
Oh, wow!

59:39.208 --> 59:43.043
Yes, I'm sure your mother has
a million pictures like these.

59:43.045 --> 59:45.347
- [both laugh]
- No.

59:46.849 --> 59:50.282
Yeah. No. My mother
didn't take pictures.

59:50.284 --> 59:54.856
Oh, come on.
Every mother takes pictures.

59:56.190 --> 59:58.093
You have the perfect family.

01:00:01.063 --> 01:00:05.668
- Mmm.
- He cheated on me more than once.

01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:09.005
- And you stayed with him?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:12.709
Well, the first time
I caught him,

01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:14.978
that did hurt

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:19.748
more than anything
I've felt since.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:25.052
Then no you begin to negotiate
with yourself.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:30.990
You say well he's a great father
and you have a nice house.

01:00:30.992 --> 01:00:32.828
But he cheated.

01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:36.164
I wanted a family

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:44.139
and I just didn't want to feel as though I was
being punished for something I didn't do.

01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:52.045
I don't know
if I can do that.

01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:53.179
[slow music]

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:56.483
Anyone can run away,

01:00:56.485 --> 01:01:00.856
anyone but I wasn't going to.

01:01:01.956 --> 01:01:04.793
It was too important to me.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.255
I have an interview in an hour.
I can't take him.

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:37.858
Will you please
tell me where she is?

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.925
Hire a babysitter.

01:01:39.927 --> 01:01:42.831
You know... I don't have time.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:51.204
So you're going to stay
with nana, okay, and...

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:54.007
run on the treadmill and have all
sorts of fun, I'll be back in an hour,

01:01:54.009 --> 01:01:54.911
okay?

01:01:56.945 --> 01:01:57.947
All right.

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.818
[rings the bell]

01:02:06.487 --> 01:02:10.923
- You love him.
- Hey, this is not my job, Henry.

01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:12.295
[car engine starts]

01:02:13.528 --> 01:02:15.465
Oh, come on.

01:02:17.498 --> 01:02:19.334
I don't think you understand
what we do here.

01:02:20.335 --> 01:02:23.039
We pack and we ship.

01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:25.842
- Yeah, I get it.
- Yeah, I don't think you do.

01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:30.543
You see we pack and we ship.

01:02:30.545 --> 01:02:33.045
You pack and ship, I got it
and I love to pack, I love it.

01:02:33.047 --> 01:02:37.753
Pack cars, suitcases, boxes.
I love to pack. I can do this.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.021
I can't hire you.

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.126
- I can... I can do this job.
- [rings the bell]

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:46.763
Pack and ship.

01:02:48.963 --> 01:02:51.333
Hey, look at them bubbles.

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:55.772
So what, you just
leave him and take off?

01:02:56.871 --> 01:03:01.141
Yeah, just like you left your
family in the middle of the night.

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:02.311
You lied to me.

01:03:03.144 --> 01:03:04.543
So, you're going to hang
out at your mom's

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:06.112
and pretend none
of this is happening.

01:03:06.114 --> 01:03:07.613
Think I want to be doing this?

01:03:07.615 --> 01:03:09.081
I don't want to do this.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:10.118
Then come home.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:11.988
You don't understand.

01:03:13.121 --> 01:03:16.623
Then make me understand.
I'm right here. Talk to me.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.925
That is the problem.
You should already know.

01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:22.095
I don't know, that's
what I saying, so tell me.

01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:26.298
Tell me what it's because I lost my...
I lost my fucking job, who cares?

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.972
The thought of going home
makes me feel terrible.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.941
The thought... so what?
That's it? That's it?

01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:38.079
That's why
you're... that's it?

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:41.384
The thought of going home
makes me feel terrible.

01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:47.423
I don't want to share
a bed with you.

01:03:49.157 --> 01:03:51.126
I don't want to touch you,

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:53.461
I don't want to be with you.

01:03:57.132 --> 01:03:58.298
Come here, buddy.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.102
[tension music]

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.516
I think we could
both use a happy hour.

01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:16.986
Jesus, Mom.

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:21.157
This is my life, my children.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:26.295
- You should be telling me to go home.
- I'm not the enemy.

01:04:28.163 --> 01:04:30.030
Why is it okay for me
to hide out here

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.331
like the last 16 years
of my life never happened?

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.967
Oh, don't make this about me.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:37.072
[music continues]

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.016
[camera shots]

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:50.385
[tires screeching]

01:05:18.112 --> 01:05:20.615
[panting]

01:05:23.018 --> 01:05:26.418
It's okay buddy.
Just a little freak out.

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.123
[Matty] Mommy.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:34.130
- Mommy.
- All right.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.633
- Mommy.
- Yeah, mommy, here we go.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:47.307
You keep yelling. We're going
to get you home to mommy.

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:50.110
- You just keep talking.
- Mommy.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:53.179
You're supposed to tell me
that's your job.

01:05:53.181 --> 01:05:56.782
And we both know that I wasn't very
good at my job. That's why I retired.

01:05:56.784 --> 01:05:58.584
You think
I knew what I was doing.

01:05:58.586 --> 01:06:00.619
- I did the best that I could.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:02.454
The best you could.
This is the best you could?

01:06:02.456 --> 01:06:03.789
What are you doing here then?

01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:07.159
Do you not think that I wish

01:06:07.161 --> 01:06:09.128
that I had anywhere else to go?

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.197
There it is.
Come on, give it to me.

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:14.434
Mommy. Mommy.

01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:17.037
- Hang on.
- Mommy. Mommy.

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:19.039
Mommy. Mommy.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:23.075
If I was your best friend, which
I know I never will be,

01:06:23.077 --> 01:06:25.278
I would tell you to do
exactly the same thing.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.079
[Henry] Matty spoke.

01:06:27.081 --> 01:06:28.380
What? Matty spoke.

01:06:28.382 --> 01:06:30.550
What? Matty. Baby.

01:06:30.552 --> 01:06:32.452
Hey. Oh, Matty.

01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:34.521
- What did he say?
- He said mommy.

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:38.291
What? Baby, say it for mommy.

01:06:38.293 --> 01:06:40.793
- [Henry] Matty, say mommy.
- Will you say it?

01:06:40.795 --> 01:06:44.764
Matty, say... he was...
he was screaming in the car

01:06:44.766 --> 01:06:47.300
over and over again.
Matty, say mommy.

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:49.168
- Say mommy, Matty.
- You can say it.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.137
- Matty, say mommy.
- Oh, baby.

01:06:51.139 --> 01:06:54.673
- Say mommy.
- Please tell me what you said.

01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:58.177
- Please. Make him say it.
- [mother] No pressure, Matty.

01:06:58.179 --> 01:06:59.711
Matty!

01:06:59.713 --> 01:07:01.516
[sad music]

01:07:09.391 --> 01:07:10.593
Such a big boy.

01:07:29.277 --> 01:07:30.512
Henry, I love them.

01:07:35.182 --> 01:07:36.619
So for the sake of the kids

01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:42.124
what do you say you get your
shit together and come on inside?

01:07:56.137 --> 01:07:58.273
- Hi, baby.
- [Trinity] I missed you so much.

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.798
- Daddy.
- Yeah.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.367
Now that mommy is back,
always make sure

01:08:28.368 --> 01:08:30.506
that you are
not in front of the car.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:33.675
That's smart.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.712
That's good advice. That's
what we call good advice. What?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.346
- What? I didn't say anything.
- [Melissa] Nothing.

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:43.215
- I don't know.
- [Trinity laughs]

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:45.218
Why did you say
about listening to your mother?

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.953
- I didn't say anything.
- I thought you said something.

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:49.955
- Who said it?
- You said it.

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.491
No.

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:54.130
What? What?

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:03.171
Melissa!

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:06.207
[music continues]

01:09:09.844 --> 01:09:12.846
Honey, there's dessert.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:20.786
No, I don't think... I don't
think that you understand, okay?

01:09:20.787 --> 01:09:23.889
because he almost has a job which means
he almost has enough money to pay you back

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.459
and if we had it then we would
give it to you, Travis.

01:09:26.461 --> 01:09:30.198
[Travis] <i>Listen to me.
He owes a lot of money to a lot of people</i>

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:33.202
<i>and if he doesn't pay it back,</i>

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:36.837
<i>some really bad things
are going to happen to him.</i>

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:40.175
I have to go.

01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:43.212
I can't talk about this anymore.

01:09:51.519 --> 01:09:52.854
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:09:55.556 --> 01:09:58.891
I just told a 15-year-old girl I
was going to take away her home

01:09:58.893 --> 01:10:04.632
and make her homeless. I don't feel
like a human being at the moment.

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:08.304
I feel like I threatened her.

01:10:09.037 --> 01:10:12.537
I feel dis... I'm disgusted
with myself.

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:16.377
You know, I studied economics
in college.

01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:21.281
I wrote my thesis, you know,
on debt. I read everything.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.385
I read every book, every paper.

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:26.686
You know, I thought that
if I could talk to people,

01:10:26.688 --> 01:10:28.854
actually talk to people that I'd

01:10:28.856 --> 01:10:32.261
understand why we do this
to ourselves as a society.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:35.898
When did it all get so crazy?

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:38.567
Where's the hope?

01:10:41.069 --> 01:10:43.736
I once had an eight-year-old boy
slit his wrist

01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:46.542
because his dad couldn't afford to
keep him in Little League anymore.

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:52.911
[Henry] That thing was done to me in
the past and I wasn't sure what to do.

01:10:52.913 --> 01:10:56.415
You can't lie
to us ever again, Henry.

01:10:56.417 --> 01:10:57.853
I was just
trying to protect you.

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:00.519
I'm your wife.

01:11:00.521 --> 01:11:01.657
I know you are.

01:11:03.024 --> 01:11:05.861
This is all we have.

01:11:09.363 --> 01:11:12.533
Don't you see that if you fuck this
up then we don't have anything.

01:11:19.974 --> 01:11:20.909
Come over here.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.010
- [bell rings]
- [Karen] You forgot your lunch.

01:11:25.012 --> 01:11:26.314
- I got it.
- Hold up.

01:11:30.385 --> 01:11:32.451
- Can I take for her as well?
- No, you cannot.

01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:34.754
Go, go. You're going
to be late. Bye.

01:11:34.756 --> 01:11:35.891
Bye.

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.792
Thank you.

01:11:38.926 --> 01:11:40.762
I'm going to walk
to school from here.

01:11:41.529 --> 01:11:43.532
- Okay.
- And, you know, Karen,

01:11:44.532 --> 01:11:46.435
we did just fine without you.

01:11:58.613 --> 01:12:02.051
[plays the harmonica]

01:12:14.429 --> 01:12:16.030
[woman] <i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

01:12:24.538 --> 01:12:26.873
I can't believe that she already
blames me for ruining her life.

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:30.910
I didn't blame my mother
until I was at least 16.

01:12:30.912 --> 01:12:33.749
- Can you even believe it?
- [phone rings]

01:12:36.551 --> 01:12:38.750
Your daughter would never
do that, right? Never.

01:12:38.752 --> 01:12:40.986
How can she talk to me
like that?

01:12:40.988 --> 01:12:44.055
I didn't raise her like that.
She doesn't know how good she has it.

01:12:44.057 --> 01:12:46.462
I think you're finished here.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.466
- What?
- Yeah.

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:53.034
Spend more time
with your family.

01:12:54.702 --> 01:12:57.870
- Fix things with your husband.
- [phone ringing]

01:12:57.872 --> 01:13:00.906
And for crying out loud,
stop resenting your children.

01:13:00.908 --> 01:13:02.942
They're just kids.

01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:07.516
They don't know any better. You
haven't taught them any better.

01:13:08.048 --> 01:13:11.653
Those pills that you're taking,
yeah, I saw you,

01:13:13.154 --> 01:13:16.856
believe me,
they're not going to help you.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:19.058
- [phone continues ringing]
- I'm...

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.496
Answer it.

01:13:21.628 --> 01:13:22.765
Hello.

01:13:24.798 --> 01:13:25.900
Yes, this is she.

01:13:29.636 --> 01:13:30.671
She what?

01:13:31.072 --> 01:13:32.972
That was my engagement ring.

01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:35.043
I was saving our house.

01:13:35.877 --> 01:13:37.543
Where is my wedding ring?

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:39.512
I'm holding on to it
for an emergency.

01:13:39.514 --> 01:13:40.815
Oh.

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:55.497
Okay.

01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:06.606
Travis, we want to fix this. We want to
make this right. So, what are our options?

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.509
[Travis] <i>I know this
has been extremely harder</i>

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:12.544
<i>for your kids,
especially Melissa...</i>

01:14:12.546 --> 01:14:14.714
Our kids are fine, Travis.

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:18.784
- Travis, give it to us straight.
- It can be really hard on them.

01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:20.986
They'd have no idea what's
going on and how this all works.

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:22.888
- [both] Travis.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:28.930
<i>As of today,
you owe $83,567.25.</i>

01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:35.770
I'm going to vomit.

01:14:38.072 --> 01:14:40.005
- Let me in.
- [Melissa] No.

01:14:40.007 --> 01:14:42.174
- I have to pee.
- Go away, I'm bleeding.

01:14:42.176 --> 01:14:43.979
- I got to get in there.
- Melissa's bleeding.

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:48.915
- Melissa, open this door.
- Please, leave me alone.

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.686
Just let me in.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.787
Oh, God. Henry. Go get daddy.

01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:57.626
Leave me alone.
I don't want daddy here.

01:14:58.192 --> 01:14:59.694
Oh.

01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:02.995
That's high.
You sure that's what I owe?

01:15:02.997 --> 01:15:04.729
Is the decimal
point in the right place?

01:15:04.731 --> 01:15:06.665
Melissa's locked
in the bathroom bleeding.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:08.601
Melissa's locked
in the bathroom bleeding.

01:15:08.603 --> 01:15:10.201
- Wait, wait.
- Who's bleeding?

01:15:10.203 --> 01:15:12.103
Melissa's bleeding.
She's bleeding.

01:15:12.105 --> 01:15:15.907
Henry. Is Melissa bleeding?
Is everything okay?

01:15:15.909 --> 01:15:18.678
Please, please. Don't let me...
don't leave me hanging here.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.783
I need to know if everything's okay.
Is everything okay? Please, let me know.

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:25.217
<i>Where's Melissa? Is Melissa
bleeding? Who's bleeding?</i>

01:15:25.219 --> 01:15:27.620
- Melissa.
- [Karen] It's okay.

01:15:27.622 --> 01:15:30.022
- Karen?
- It's okay, honey.

01:15:30.024 --> 01:15:31.958
- Trinity said Melissa was bleeding.
- [Melissa] Go away.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.858
No, but if we have to go
to the hospital.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.827
We don't need
to go to the hospital.

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:39.165
- All right. Okay.
- <i>Henry? Melissa, Melissa?</i>

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.269
Henry, go.

01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:44.303
I have no idea what the hell I'm
doing in this fucking company!

01:15:44.305 --> 01:15:46.973
You're not helping me.
She slit her fucking wrist.

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:50.012
I can't do this job anymore.
No, no, no. I can't do it.

01:15:53.747 --> 01:15:55.250
I got mine in gym class.

01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:57.853
Can we please
not talk about this?

01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:03.191
Honey, it's just natural.

01:16:05.126 --> 01:16:07.058
[crying] I stole your ring.

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.930
We got it back.

01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:11.062
It's okay.

01:16:11.064 --> 01:16:13.201
And I thought I was helping.

01:16:14.902 --> 01:16:18.103
- Melissa, I'm not mad.
- [sobbing]

01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:21.208
I'm always sorry that I put
you in that position, honey.

01:16:23.043 --> 01:16:25.846
I don't want you to worry
about it. We got the ring back.

01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:29.850
It's okay. I promise.

01:16:30.984 --> 01:16:32.353
You're not mad?

01:16:34.055 --> 01:16:35.324
I am not mad.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.023
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:40.026
- I am so sorry...
- You didn't do anything.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:42.061
...for everything
that's going on.

01:16:42.063 --> 01:16:44.766
- I did it. I did it and I...
- I'm so sorry. No.

01:16:45.332 --> 01:16:46.768
Yeah.

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:51.073
I thought,
when you left, about...

01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:55.743
about everything that I've said

01:16:56.377 --> 01:17:00.148
and everything that I've done and
the ways that I haven't helped you.

01:17:01.082 --> 01:17:04.983
You're not crazy. You're not
and I didn't mean then...

01:17:04.985 --> 01:17:09.021
I know. I know. I know. Melissa.

01:17:09.023 --> 01:17:12.958
Because you weren't there and I
didn't know what I was supposed to do.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.728
Honey, you weren't
supposed to do anything.

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:19.397
It's not your job,
that's my job. I'm your mom

01:17:19.399 --> 01:17:23.035
and I'm so sorry I left
my post. I won't do it again.

01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:27.039
I promise you with all my heart
I will not leave you again

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:29.277
ever in my whole life.

01:17:30.811 --> 01:17:33.247
Being your mom
means everything to me.

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.118
So then...

01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:43.792
if you love me then...

01:17:44.859 --> 01:17:48.329
then you won't get a divorce
and you'll stay?

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.234
Since you love me?

01:17:53.967 --> 01:17:56.268
- Oh...
- You said...

01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:00.940
Melissa, no honey, no,
it's not that at all.

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.010
It's just...

01:18:04.145 --> 01:18:06.348
it's just so complicated, honey.

01:18:07.047 --> 01:18:10.081
- What's...?
- Um...

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:11.819
What's complicated?

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.024
I love you and I love your dad

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:22.527
but sometimes life
just gets really difficult

01:18:22.529 --> 01:18:27.333
and things change
and you can't stop them

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:30.038
from changing no matter
how hard you try.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:36.945
[slow music continues]

01:18:47.087 --> 01:18:48.553
Give me a second.

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:51.055
I just want to enjoy

01:18:51.057 --> 01:18:53.893
watching your beg
for a little bit longer.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.361
- I'm not begging.
- Oh, yes you are.

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.295
- I'm glad you're enjoying this.
- [laughs]

01:18:57.297 --> 01:19:00.098
Do you have any idea
what it was like for me

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.468
to sit and watch my daughter
throw her life away

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:05.838
on some loser that got her
knocked up at a Y2K party?

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.072
You just can't believe
that we're actually in love.

01:19:08.074 --> 01:19:10.241
It kills you just seeing
your daughter married to me.

01:19:10.243 --> 01:19:13.512
And none of this had to happen
if she had gotten the abortion

01:19:13.514 --> 01:19:15.915
that I told her
to but no she had to get back...

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.017
Forget it. It's fine. It's fine.
I didn't want to come here.

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.052
I came because of Karen
but I'm glad.

01:19:20.054 --> 01:19:22.955
I'm glad that you're not
giving us the money

01:19:22.957 --> 01:19:26.061
because now she can finally see you
for the miserable bitch that you are.

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:31.196
How are those job opportunities
coming? Huh?

01:19:31.198 --> 01:19:32.399
What do you got now?

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:37.905
[machine beeping]

01:19:46.113 --> 01:19:48.784
[soft music]

01:20:06.533 --> 01:20:08.202
[panting]

01:20:10.104 --> 01:20:11.039
Ah...

01:20:14.574 --> 01:20:17.942
Ah! Ah!

01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:20.981
- [moans]
- [machine beeping]

01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:26.488
[siren wailing]

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:53.148
Let's get dressed
then go back to the hospital.

01:20:55.548 --> 01:20:56.917
[Karen] She's dying, Henry.

01:20:58.551 --> 01:21:00.919
My mom is dying.

01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:02.289
No, honey, no.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:08.160
Doctor said she has a good
chance of coming through this.

01:21:08.162 --> 01:21:10.097
She's dying.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.202
And she hates me.

01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:17.471
And I just want her to be okay.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.281
[man] I'll give you
my three junkies for your widow.

01:21:30.283 --> 01:21:32.284
- Oh, come on man...
- She's that annoying.

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:34.452
Okay. I'll take your widow

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:37.455
if you take my cross-dressing
graduate student

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:40.159
who's gambled away his father's
life-insurance policy.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.660
Ah mechanic wait 60k?

01:21:42.662 --> 01:21:45.063
Bankrupt schoolteacher
and I'll consider it.

01:21:45.065 --> 01:21:48.032
I'll take your bankrupt teacher.
I could always close them.

01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:51.303
The mechanic, he's selling his car
when he's got 18 grand in the bank.

01:21:51.305 --> 01:21:53.504
I know I'll jump at the chance
of settle.

01:21:53.506 --> 01:21:56.075
I could probably offer
him 30 cents on the dollar.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.509
Fuck that, man.
That's a bullshit

01:21:57.511 --> 01:21:59.378
commission
for all that work, bruh.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.546
- [phone ringing]
- [man] Am I fucking Santa Claus?

01:22:01.548 --> 01:22:04.215
- Forget it. I'll do it myself.
- [woman] I'll do it for 28%.

01:22:04.217 --> 01:22:06.050
[man] Twenty seven point five.

01:22:06.052 --> 01:22:08.053
[woman]
27, that's my lowest offer.

01:22:08.055 --> 01:22:13.125
- Hello.
- [Henry] <i>Travis, it's Henry Warner calling.</i>

01:22:13.127 --> 01:22:16.361
Mr. Warner,
it's... thank you.

01:22:16.363 --> 01:22:18.263
Please, tell me
everything's okay.

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:20.632
<i>Yeah, we're at St. Helens.</i>

01:22:20.634 --> 01:22:22.768
<i>They say she's going
to pull through.</i>

01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:25.603
It's so good to hear it. Listen,
I am so sorry for every...

01:22:25.605 --> 01:22:28.139
Travis,
you're just doing your job.

01:22:28.141 --> 01:22:30.576
I was not doing a good job
as a human being.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:33.982
Travis, I'm not
looking for any favors.

01:22:34.614 --> 01:22:37.215
I spent it,
I owe it, I'll pay it.

01:22:37.217 --> 01:22:38.717
No, you can't
think about it that way.

01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:40.785
<i>I know what I'm going to do.</i>

01:22:40.787 --> 01:22:42.723
- <i>I'm going to delete your whole file.</i>
- What?

01:22:44.158 --> 01:22:45.627
[upbeat music]

01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:00.641
[alarm ringing]

01:23:05.512 --> 01:23:07.148
- [bell rings]
- [man] Parker?

01:23:08.181 --> 01:23:11.719
- Well, then.
- I'm not sure.

01:23:24.597 --> 01:23:26.033
You think this is your money?

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.170
- They have three kids.
- You think this is your money?

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:31.836
Listen, the guy lost his job!

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:33.539
Do you think
this is your money?

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:36.275
- They don't have it!
- They never have it!

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:38.012
Wake the fuck up!

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.181
What's the matter with you?

01:23:41.448 --> 01:23:44.619
These people borrowed and spent
money that didn't belong to them

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.222
with a promise to pay it back.

01:23:48.154 --> 01:23:49.390
Now they want to break
that promise?

01:23:50.157 --> 01:23:51.659
Someone's going to have
to eat it.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.297
Sure. We'll compromise

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:00.167
because less is better
than nothing but...

01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:04.372
it's not what we wanted
it to be.

01:24:06.806 --> 01:24:08.242
It never is.

01:24:09.342 --> 01:24:10.711
The system is broken.

01:24:11.444 --> 01:24:12.613
You're probably right.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:14.981
You're done.

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:19.585
- I'm done?
- Get your shit out of here?

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.822
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:24.091
But, sir, I think
I can do so much...

01:24:31.798 --> 01:24:34.532
- Sit right here.
- You can ring me back.

01:24:34.534 --> 01:24:37.171
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

01:24:40.306 --> 01:24:41.874
Okay. All right.
We'll be right back.

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:44.412
- [Melissa] Bye, guys.
- [Karen] Oh, God.

01:24:45.712 --> 01:24:46.648
Okay.

01:24:56.823 --> 01:24:59.094
[cardiac monitor beeping]

01:25:14.942 --> 01:25:16.444
[whispering]
I can't be here right now.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:20.611
I'm going to go to the house
and get her some clothes...

01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:21.914
- Got it.
- ...and get her some makeup.

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.485
Right. I'll stay here in case...

01:25:31.658 --> 01:25:35.195
Don't let it harsh your mellow.
You don't belong here.

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.532
[soft music]

01:25:42.936 --> 01:25:45.140
You really fucked that one up,
didn't you kid?

01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:49.443
She almost died.

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.483
Wow. It really got you.

01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:04.956
[monitor beeping]

01:26:04.958 --> 01:26:06.594
She's lucky to have you.

01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:08.863
I'm pretty sure
she'd disagree with you.

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:12.830
[doctor] We won't know anything
until she wakes up,

01:26:12.832 --> 01:26:15.534
that's when we'll find out
if there was any brain damage

01:26:15.536 --> 01:26:17.672
due to the cardiac arrest.

01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:23.711
[doctor] <i>She's going to need
your help while she recovers.</i>

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:30.851
<i>It could be a long road and she
definitely can't do it alone.</i>

01:26:37.858 --> 01:26:39.793
[slow music]

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.922
[alarm clock ringing]

01:27:47.461 --> 01:27:49.264
[slow music continues]

01:27:58.706 --> 01:27:59.841
[sighs]

01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:05.680
- [doctor] Your mom's a strong lady.
- Mother-in-law.

01:28:08.548 --> 01:28:09.981
You know, it'll be good
to talk to her,

01:28:09.983 --> 01:28:11.853
let her know you're here.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.565
I know you're in there somewhere
laughing at me.

01:28:27.533 --> 01:28:32.039
That's okay because I'm going
to put a webcam in here.

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:36.708
I want to shave your head into a
Mohawk, I'm going to paint your nails

01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:39.047
black and I'm going to put
it up on OkCupid.

01:28:42.548 --> 01:28:44.918
Come on. Come on.

01:28:46.386 --> 01:28:48.889
What do you want me to say,
I'm sorry? I'm sorry.

01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:55.529
I'm sorry. Okay?
I fucked up. I fucked up.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:29:00.067
I know I lied to Karen. She can't trust me.
I fucked up, I get it.

01:29:04.738 --> 01:29:05.606
Just...

01:29:08.007 --> 01:29:08.876
[sighs]

01:29:10.476 --> 01:29:12.512
Things are not how I thought
they were going to be.

01:29:18.118 --> 01:29:19.620
Everything's changing.

01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:27.959
I don't know when I'll get a job. I don't
know how I'm going to support my family

01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:32.632
and like it or not...
you're a part of that family.

01:29:35.668 --> 01:29:39.437
You need to be nicer to Karen.
You need to love Karen more.

01:29:39.439 --> 01:29:41.576
Karen is worthy of your love.

01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:44.811
Don't give up on her.

01:29:47.847 --> 01:29:49.050
Don't give up on her yet.

01:29:53.119 --> 01:29:54.855
Don't give up on all of us.

01:30:02.895 --> 01:30:06.099
[woman] Mr. Warner.
Has anyone seen Mr. Warner?

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.934
Mr. Warner.

01:30:09.936 --> 01:30:13.006
- [children screaming]
- [Henry] Stop!

01:30:14.807 --> 01:30:16.942
Listen, I'm sorry about that.
I just...

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:19.611
I don't want you
to get divorced dad.

01:30:19.613 --> 01:30:21.115
[slow music]

01:30:38.798 --> 01:30:40.264
- [woman] Mr. Warner.
- [Henry] Yeah.

01:30:40.266 --> 01:30:42.267
- Mr. Warner? You forgot this.
- Yes.

01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:45.606
- Thank you. Thanks.
- It's mine.

01:30:48.809 --> 01:30:50.842
[indistinct chatter]

01:30:50.844 --> 01:30:53.980
- [Melissa] Shut up, I love you.
- Let's go, guys.

Here. You got two weeks to close
or I'll find someone else.

01:31:32.752 --> 01:31:34.885
- Look how high...
- [Karen] Look at this.

01:31:34.887 --> 01:31:37.856
- Is that you?
- How creepy is this bunny?

01:31:37.858 --> 01:31:41.092
- Crazy. It's so cute.
- Right? I love it.

01:31:41.094 --> 01:31:43.727

- [Karen] What?

01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:45.964
- No, I'm not.
- [Trinity] Matty, come on.

- It'll be fun. Come one.
- Please be careful. Nobody hurt themselves.

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:51.035
I told them not
to jump on the bed.

01:31:51.037 --> 01:31:53.338
- [Trinity] Yeah.
- She can jump if she wants to.

01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:57.043
You can jump too if you want to.
I know you want to.

01:31:58.878 --> 01:32:01.845
- [laughing]
- A little bit.
