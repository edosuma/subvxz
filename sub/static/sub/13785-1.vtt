(birds calling)

01:52.696 --> 01:54.447
(rooster crows)

01:58.535 --> 02:01.412
Fixin' toward
a bloody outcome, boss.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.749
Absenting myself don't change
your fuckin' instructions.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.047
(distant hammering)

02:28.065 --> 02:31.067
- (speaking foreign language)
- Parp.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.031
Parp.
Parp.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.826
Parp.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.161
(foreign chatter continues)

02:44.122 --> 02:45.331
Parp.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.834
- Slainte.
- Slainte.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.836
Parp.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.172
Parp. Parp.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.092
- Parp.
- (conversation continues)

02:56.260 --> 02:59.929
(man speaking gibberish)

03:00.097 --> 03:02.765
- Whoop goggle.
- (conversation continues)

03:02.933 --> 03:04.976
Whoop goggle, boop boop.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.604
(man shouts)

03:08.772 --> 03:09.981
Parp.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.779
- (gunshot)
- Dan: Hey!

03:16.947 --> 03:18.823
- (gunshot)
- Hey!

03:22.703 --> 03:26.372
- Get the fuck out!
- He come at me with his foreign gibberish.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.208
You get the fuck out
while I let you get the fuck out.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.963
You too! You get out that way.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.634
Leave him be or you'll be
riding the goddamn sled with him.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.178
Get out!

03:47.436 --> 03:48.936
Parp...

03:50.689 --> 03:53.399
Either of you cocksuckers
want to talk funny at me?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.071
Good day, sir.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.661
Good day.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.295
Wu's out of camp.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.339
Store him in our corner
of the icehouse.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.724
(slams)

04:32.272 --> 04:34.941
- Will you look this over?
- Certainly.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.361
Words doing the wrong jobs,

04:38.528 --> 04:41.822
piling on too heavy
or at odds over meaning--

04:41.990 --> 04:44.075
I'll mark my suggestions.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.118
Nothing showy is the main thing.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.870
I understand.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.834
Shall I gather my school supplies?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.836
I'm much obliged.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.756
(furniture drags)

04:58.924 --> 05:00.883
That's better, isn't it?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.718
Mm.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.513
Over here?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.108
I will apologize, Mr. Ellsworth,
for what I am about to ask.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.694
She wants to try it on the ceiling.

05:19.861 --> 05:24.740
A coverlet, dark red, is packed
with the linens in the gray leather trunk.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.325
Back at the hotel.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.787
It's near time in any case
to take Sofia to school.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.373
The settee is best sited

05:32.541 --> 05:35.418
with its spread upon it
would be your mother's idea.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.920
Mr. Ellsworth will help you
gather your things,

05:38.088 --> 05:40.339
- darling, for school.
- Young lady.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.591
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.594
Will I bring you back
a sandwich or a glass of milk?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.639
Just the coverlet, thank you.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.103
Seth: I'd sooner be hanging
from those hustings

05:54.271 --> 05:56.105
than stand on 'em giving a speech.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.735
Nuttall's bartender's
no hand at it either.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.279
We both may get pelted with refuse.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.290
(thuds)

06:14.458 --> 06:17.209
- Ellsworth: Morning.
- Good morning, Sofia.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.295
Good morning.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.505
We will we bake bread
again today?

06:21.673 --> 06:24.091
- Is it your vote we should?
- Yes.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.887
And Mr. Bullock for sheriff
and Mr. Star for mayor.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.598
And I will put the bread in to bake.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.976
If I'm to believe what I read,
you're heavily scheduled today.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.979
- Yes.
- As to your meetin' with Hearst,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.940
if the chance comes up natural,

06:40.108 --> 06:42.651
stomp on the cocksucker's foot.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.788
- Joanie: Morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:56.458 --> 07:00.711
Jane: Off to the Bella Union
like the moth to the fucking flame.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.839
Miss Stubbs didn't name
her destination.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.175
I'm telling you where she's going.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.346
And why don't you
look for honest work?

07:10.514 --> 07:13.265
Miss Stubbs holds
what I'm doing for honest.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.267
She no more needs a watchman

07:15.435 --> 07:17.520
than she does a fucking balloonist.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.856
And why should the young
of this camp have to scurry past

07:21.024 --> 07:23.984
your man-toad figure
to receive an education?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.694
The time they come for schoolin',

07:25.862 --> 07:27.738
I'm in back and out of sight.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.825
Exposin' them to being terrified
only when they use the privy.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.701
Go get your load on, Jane.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.288
(shouts) Do not instruct me
how to spend my day...

07:38.041 --> 07:40.417
or to itemize for you

07:40.585 --> 07:43.796
my crowded itinerary...

07:44.840 --> 07:47.758
you tub of blubber and guts.

07:47.926 --> 07:52.763
Mose: I've got 10 minutes yet
to be out front.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.161
Ellsworth: Might I give over
the little one to you here?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.662
Of course.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.290
Ellsworth:
When next we meet, young lady,

08:19.457 --> 08:22.084
I will be on the eye
for warm bread.

08:23.461 --> 08:27.256
Wants a coverlet from storage--
Mrs. Ellsworth--

08:27.424 --> 08:29.675
to consider atop the daybed.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.429
Framing of a dream.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.015
He's saying that to you, Seth.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.438
Mr. Ellsworth,

08:43.607 --> 08:46.859
no doubt on some
menial domestic errand.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.948
Al: Sheriff!

08:53.116 --> 08:54.533
Forgive my raucous tone.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.286
- Martha: Mr. Swearengen.
- May we have a word?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.538
Once I've see 'em to school,
I meet Hearst.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.624
Very much what I'd have us speak of.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.669
Sofia:
Can we plant beets again today?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.379
Martha: Yes.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.595
Charlie: "Thank you... thank you
for the introduction, Sheriff."

09:16.139 --> 09:18.140
- Sheriff.
- Morning, Charlie.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.060
- Morning. Mrs. Bullock.
- Good morning, Mr. Utter.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.313
Morning there, little one,
in your lovely go-to-school outfit.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.357
Good morning.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.859
Did the evening pass in quiet?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.903
The morning got a little busy.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.821
Cornishman killed in The Gem.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.532
His buddies come babbling
to our office.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.117
Dority kill him?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.954
The complainants can't speak right

09:40.121 --> 09:41.914
so I had to have them play act.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.625
- But I'm guessing no.
- They up in the office still?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.627
Down in Hearst's shafts.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.671
We'll say goodbye.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.174
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Sofia.
- Goodbye.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.551
- Charlie: Goodbye there, little one.
- Goodbye.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.179
Thank you.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.558
Sofia: Hi, Dorothy.
Good morning, James.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.399
Nice thing, ain't it?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.359
The children?

10:16.700 --> 10:19.201
Will you attend
the evening speeches, Richardson?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.412
- If you let me.
- Of course I will.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.998
How else are you to vote
with intelligence?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.251
(chuckles)
I intend no lengthy remarks.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.587
My tenure as mayor
speaks for me.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.428
Will they have
the Jew merchant instead?

10:37.595 --> 10:41.307
Well, let them then and welcome.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.810
I caught you, Richardson,
stuffin' spitbacks in your vile maw.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.229
"Let tomorrow's omelets go empty."

10:47.397 --> 10:49.064
Is that your fuckin' attitude?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.108
- You hurted me.
- Shh!

10:51.276 --> 10:55.154
Wash and stack, shit monkey,
or ready yourself for worse.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.576
- Leon: Congratulations, sir.
- Con: Congratulations.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.419
Florence Nightingale.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.963
Florence Nightingale is a nurse.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.341
I know that,
you ignorant cocksucker.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.093
Joanie Stubbs is a cocksucker.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.472
- I know that, you ignorant fuck.
- (man clears throat)

11:21.639 --> 11:24.933
Don't be sweatin' all over
the gentleman's money. (chuckles)

11:25.101 --> 11:26.602
1500.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.313
And thank you for that rasher of shit.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.274
All: Give us this day
our daily bread,

11:32.442 --> 11:35.027
and forgive us our trespasses

11:35.195 --> 11:39.448
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.452
And lead us not into temptation,

11:43.620 --> 11:45.954
but deliver us from evil,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.957
for Thine is the kingdom

11:49.125 --> 11:52.336
and the power and the glory,
forever and ever.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.630
Amen.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.471
(Joanie exhales)

12:02.639 --> 12:04.848
- Morning, Tess.
- Morning, Joanie.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.683
Git.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.645
- I can take him that.
- I got it.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.564
- (water pouring)
- How's Cy?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.234
I don't know yet, Tess.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.486
It's none of your business anyway.

12:17.654 --> 12:21.407
You're only business is
how you start the fucking day.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.076
- I'm clean.
- Before you go to sleep,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.537
how are you supposed to start?

12:26.704 --> 12:29.373
- I said I'm clean.
- You answer my goddamn question.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.917
- My snatch is clean.
- Is the rest of your body clean?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.919
- Yes.
- What's next?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.256
The room where I receive,
and that's fucking clean.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.967
- What's next after that?
- God damn you, Joanie.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.678
What's next, Lila,
if you ain't too fucking high?

12:42.846 --> 12:46.348
- Our room where we rest.
- Which don't it fuckin' stink in here?

12:46.516 --> 12:50.060
It does, Lila, like a hogwhore's cunt.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.688
And I ain't loaded not to smell it.
Whyn't you go, girl?

12:52.856 --> 12:56.692
Why don't you get to the muck
where you're fuckin' headed anyway?

12:56.860 --> 12:59.695
Go on. Git.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.534
- What are you doin', sitting back there?
- Oh, please let me stay.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.664
When I'm back tonight you better
all be sweet for me to fuck.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.334
Or have your damn bags packed,
'cause I'll throw every one of you out.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.753
Move, Tess, move.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.094
You know she's going to let her stay.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.058
(stomps)

13:30.226 --> 13:31.977
(growls)

13:32.145 --> 13:33.645
(knocks)

13:36.024 --> 13:37.900
Come on in, honey.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.402
How are you?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.404
I'm all right.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.073
Was the doc by?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.409
Brightened my early mornin'.

13:47.577 --> 13:51.413
Another day on the right side
of the ledger far as pus.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.082
(catches breath)

13:55.585 --> 13:57.836
- How's the action outside?
- It's quiet.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.672
Either clown upright
to tell you what the action was?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.382
I didn't ask.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.010
I guess you'd stopped in
on the whores.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.519
You might have mistook, Cy,
pickin' Tess over Lila to see to 'em.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.605
- Lila's on the needle.
- Tess ain't pickin' up the bit.

14:16.773 --> 14:21.068
Maybe she's unsure of her place,
you in and out of our lives.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.365
Well, fresh water.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.200
You're not leaving yet, are you?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.786
Right here, Cy, on the side table.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.830
Act like a fucking baby, don't I?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.917
(mimics whining)
"Oh, don't go."

14:37.085 --> 14:40.796
- Where's my good book, honey?
- It's just next to you, in the bedfold.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.801
(door closes)

14:53.059 --> 14:55.519
I've been scooping out
rain gutters for a month.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.063
My fingers are bloody with sandin'.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.984
You do recall you're only
the transactions beard?

15:05.863 --> 15:09.157
Al: You return to Star:
a sorry run at the tables;

15:09.325 --> 15:11.577
you can't support
the loan he made you.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.829
Well, what if he don't foreclose?

15:13.997 --> 15:16.373
Oh, you beg him to buy you out.
You may harm yourself.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.376
You're up all hours, "What have
I fucking done?" or the like.

15:19.544 --> 15:23.589
"Maybe I should fucking end it."
Star ends owning that house

15:23.756 --> 15:25.841
is the necessary fucking conclusion.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.385
- Coffee!
- Ready.

15:28.553 --> 15:29.845
That croaker seen to?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.264
At Wu's icehouse under a tarp
in our corner.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.641
Will you pour it
without scalding me, huh?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.518
Breakfast?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.356
Bacon and eggs.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.610
(brush thuds)

15:44.777 --> 15:47.988
You know you could have said that
before I went down.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.157
You get in the kitchen.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.251
I liked living in that place.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.420
Why do I give a fuck?

16:05.173 --> 16:08.258
(Al growling)

16:12.722 --> 16:15.807
So why not force
this morning's murder outside?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.768
You told us not too.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.936
As it stank of a put-up job,

16:20.104 --> 16:23.732
I wanted to find out if we
were meant for the venue.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.069
Well, whoever put the job up
can't be any too smart.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.655
'Cause them Cornish work for Hearst.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.783
Murder a Cornish and you buy
Hearst for an enemy.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.826
You're a fucking miracle, Johnny.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.787
It's close to a mortal certainty

16:36.954 --> 16:38.705
he ordered the murder himself.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.791
- Hearst?
- Shut up!

16:40.958 --> 16:42.542
(scrubbing)

16:42.710 --> 16:44.628
He stages a murder
in my fucking joint.

16:44.796 --> 16:48.632
Wants Bullock to show his ass
before he'll bless his fucking candidacy.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.510
What does he require of the weather?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.179
Jesus Christ. That's it.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.640
That's how you clean
a fuckin' bloodstain, hey.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.267
What if we stretched out
the payments?

16:59.435 --> 17:02.604
I cannot fucking make it. What the fuck
was in my head to sign that note?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.815
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy, Mr. Adams.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.108
(groans)
Take it off me. Can't you?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.861
Ain't there some way to take it off?!

17:10.029 --> 17:12.656
Oh God!

17:17.704 --> 17:19.162
I'm in crisis too,

17:19.329 --> 17:21.915
needing awfully to piss.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.756
Why not cork up and go on stage

17:29.924 --> 17:32.634
with that tragic fuckin' minstrel turn?

17:32.802 --> 17:34.469
Are you alone?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.139
Yes, Miss Bernhardt, I am.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.474
Al wants Star to take over that house.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.269
Why?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.397
Keep my ruddy color
not askin' Al his reasons.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.456
Disarray...

18:02.623 --> 18:04.249
in your room.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.961
Your last day when you left-- disarray.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.422
- I sat on the bed.
- I won't have it.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.507
Did you hear me, Shaunessey?

18:12.675 --> 18:15.343
My last day I sat on the bed
for three hours.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.845
I had a glass of water.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.889
Yes yes yes. Very likely.

18:19.891 --> 18:23.393
Uh, 1F, $2.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.570
The book, please.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.581
Ink on the floor,

18:44.749 --> 18:47.501
pen near blunted, possibly broke,

18:47.668 --> 18:49.544
bindings damaged--

18:50.880 --> 18:53.048
I won't stand for it.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.842
Give that back to the gimp.

19:09.398 --> 19:13.235
What the fuck are you trying to pull
with Adams's fucking house?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.278
Star needs to move into that.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.572
He's a candidate for office.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.742
He can't whore-fuck
no longer with impunity.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.994
Who says I want
to live in that house?

19:23.162 --> 19:26.498
You ain't. You're installing
at fucking Shaunessey's.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.875
The fuck if I'll live in that shithole.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.545
Al: Shaunessey being
richer by 50 for his common wall

19:31.712 --> 19:34.422
with Star's home-to-be
and the passage he cut through it,

19:34.590 --> 19:38.260
so you and the Jew can fall upon each other
away from prying eyes.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.262
Fuck you, Al,

19:40.429 --> 19:42.264
fuck Shaunessey's

19:42.431 --> 19:44.724
and fuck the passage

19:44.892 --> 19:47.602
into Adams's fuckin' house.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.273
Loopy cunt.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.489
(quiet crying)

20:19.969 --> 20:22.679
The wrist business
on Adams' house loan,

20:22.847 --> 20:25.348
Adams being nothing
but his fucking stalking horse

20:25.516 --> 20:27.309
from the gambit's fucking beginning.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.144
You sign to take those over,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.229
we'll move in your 12 possessions.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.524
You will be free to come and go
by your own front fucking door,

20:34.692 --> 20:36.818
and as you lay in your beddy-bye,

20:36.986 --> 20:38.820
I'll pop from the wall

20:38.988 --> 20:41.156
like Grandma Groundhog
in a storybook

20:41.324 --> 20:42.991
and attend to your Johnson,

20:43.159 --> 20:45.827
as he'd not see you jeopardize
your mayor's campaign

20:45.995 --> 20:47.996
whore fucking in your
place of business.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.624
And I'll have installed

20:50.791 --> 20:54.419
in room 3-fucking-C or the like
of Shaunessey's adjacent shitbox,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.963
that he's paid Shaunessey
to cut a hole through

20:57.131 --> 20:59.257
to ease my fuckin' fucking you.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.927
Swearengen has?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.971
Who the fuck was I just talking to?

21:05.139 --> 21:08.642
I don't know.
You said you'd just gone to piss.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.858
Man of the hour.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.777
Quick prick-suck, Bullock?

21:18.945 --> 21:22.322
Sally forth to meet the great man
with unencumbered thoughts?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.449
What happened in here this morning?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.534
Charlie Utter says
a man was murdered,

21:26.702 --> 21:28.370
one of Hearst's workers.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.498
I'd spare you the particulars
till after your meeting concludes.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.417
- Why?
- Why ask why?

21:34.585 --> 21:37.045
Why not honor
the meeting's purpose?

21:37.213 --> 21:40.966
Speak as a candidate of your hopes
for the camp and its future,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.134
confine yourself to generalities.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.062
Suppose Hearst...

21:54.230 --> 21:57.232
was this murder's architect?

21:57.400 --> 22:00.735
Suppose the workers
were thieves or organizers?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.654
Why kill 'em in camp
before witnesses?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.699
Maybe as message to me
his domain includes my fucking joint,

22:05.866 --> 22:07.575
and to test
your willingness to bend

22:07.743 --> 22:10.578
to his fucking will before
he backs your candidacy.

22:12.248 --> 22:17.002
What we know, fucking Bullock,
is if when you two meet

22:17.169 --> 22:21.423
Hearst does ask you to go easy, and you,
for love of his type, say "Fuck yourself,"

22:21.590 --> 22:24.259
no more illumination can come to us

22:24.427 --> 22:26.928
because you will have
muddied the fuckin' waters.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.350
Is why I'd hoped
you'd skirt the topic.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.604
Has the body been eaten?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.940
The Cornish croaker?
Wu's out of fucking camp.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.734
Don't let it get eaten.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.777
Oh, absolutely--

22:42.945 --> 22:44.946
till your further full investigation.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.990
As for your meeting with Hearst,

22:47.158 --> 22:49.451
may I offer a fervent Godspeed

22:49.618 --> 22:53.329
and hopes for your fucking
self-control?!

23:01.797 --> 23:04.424
What am I, Lord,

23:04.592 --> 23:08.094
that I'm so helpless?

23:10.806 --> 23:12.724
(clicks)

23:12.892 --> 23:15.477
(gasping)

23:28.491 --> 23:30.200
Bullock.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.494
He ascends, Richardson,

23:32.661 --> 23:35.121
to be dug at and sifted and shoveled

23:35.289 --> 23:37.707
till his crucial vein is exposed.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.586
- (knocks)
- Then Hearst will empty him out.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.338
(chuckles)

23:43.506 --> 23:45.173
Much anticipated, Mr. Bullock,

23:45.341 --> 23:48.093
some good solid talk between us.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.719
- Will you drink?
- No...

23:49.887 --> 23:52.889
- thanks.
- I believe I won't either.

23:54.308 --> 23:55.850
(exhales)

23:57.103 --> 24:00.522
I'm told that you operate
a hardware concern.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.440
I'm partnered with Sol Star.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.027
Ah, candidate for mayor,
as you are for sheriff.

24:10.032 --> 24:14.035
And an officer
of the Deadwood Bank.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.624
Sol's Chief Officer, yes.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.085
And you are an officer too.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.711
Yes.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.339
The bank capitalized,
as I understand,

24:26.507 --> 24:29.050
by Mrs. Alma Garret Ellsworth...

24:30.761 --> 24:33.805
formerly quartered in this hotel

24:33.973 --> 24:37.142
and who has struck
so rich in these hills.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.435
Way back second to you.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.521
Extraordinary,

24:41.689 --> 24:43.898
the story of that
woman's adventures.

24:44.066 --> 24:47.193
Do you suppose that
its future chapters

24:47.361 --> 24:48.903
might be written...

24:49.071 --> 24:51.364
elsewhere than the Hills?

24:55.244 --> 24:57.370
What are your intentions?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.373
As to Mrs. Ellsworth's holdings,

25:00.541 --> 25:03.710
I would shape those
to the lady's preferences,

25:03.878 --> 25:08.047
and be pleased and grateful
if you told her.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.929
Do you need a handkerchief,
Mr. Bullock?

25:17.892 --> 25:19.225
No.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.561
Unfortunate incident this morning

25:21.729 --> 25:24.439
at Swearengen's saloon.
Do you know about it?

25:26.108 --> 25:27.734
No.

25:27.902 --> 25:31.279
One of my workmen was killed
in a drunken shootout.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.115
- Hmm.
- How will you deal with that, Sheriff?

25:34.283 --> 25:37.076
Depends-- what it was about?
Who makes complaints?

25:37.244 --> 25:40.205
Mmm.
My worker was Cornish.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.292
They are a clannish people.
I suppose another Cornish might complain.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.419
I'd need to hear what he said then.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.339
He may also indict the sunrise.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.299
For men of that sort,

25:51.467 --> 25:55.011
events such as these are as natural.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.888
Anyways.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.307
May we speak of your ambitions?

25:59.475 --> 26:00.975
Another time.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.312
I would want to support them, you see?
I would want to back you--

26:04.480 --> 26:07.482
to thank you for taking her my message.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.984
I never said I'd take her your message.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.986
Are you saying now that you won't?

26:12.154 --> 26:13.821
You stay out of our fuckin' affairs.

26:13.989 --> 26:18.826
Oh... affairs of that sort

26:18.994 --> 26:22.413
are not my interest, Mr. Bullock.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.792
My only passion is the color.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.005
Excuse me.

26:32.299 --> 26:35.343
(footsteps descending)

26:36.679 --> 26:39.180
Bullock, how did you like Mr. Hearst?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.600
What are you doing?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.143
Oh!

26:44.311 --> 26:47.272
- You piece of shit.
- How have I given offense?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.857
You told him.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.611
Call the law.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.865
(beating continues)

27:06.333 --> 27:08.751
The sheriff's killing the mayor.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.462
In the thoroughfare,
if I fucking need you.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.215
- (thudding)
- Al: Bullock?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.384
Bullock... Bullock!

27:16.552 --> 27:20.930
Why are you beating Farnum
in Mr. Hearst's hotel?

27:21.098 --> 27:22.390
How are you, sir?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.726
I am well, Mr. Swearengen,
and how are you?

27:25.728 --> 27:27.562
Bullock!

27:30.065 --> 27:32.442
Shall I have him seen to, sir?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.402
He seems to need that.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.571
My place, Sheriff?

27:36.739 --> 27:38.823
Boys!
EB's had an accident.

27:38.991 --> 27:43.411
Under your supervision, and then
inform us on his further transport.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.996
Yes.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.498
Give the poor fuck
your shoulders, boys, huh?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.250
Sheriff!

27:51.086 --> 27:54.297
- Much experienced at the enterprise, sir.
- I haven't a doubt.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.632
And once he's situated,
may you and me speak?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.634
Of course.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.970
(softly)
You saw fuckin' nothing.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.147
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.358
Doc:
Mrs. Ellsworth?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.360
No.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.861
You must drink this.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.781
I will not awaken that demon, Doctor.

28:19.948 --> 28:23.159
This has nothing to do
with demons, Mrs. Ellsworth.

28:23.327 --> 28:26.954
This has to do with allaying
the pain to get you through.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.416
Leave the demons to God
and trust the pain to me.

28:42.554 --> 28:46.641
"A lady should not choose
a man who chews tobacco."

28:48.310 --> 28:50.978
A lady should not choose a man...

28:51.146 --> 28:53.856
who chews tobacco.

28:56.151 --> 29:00.029
"It robs his pocket,
soils his clothes...

29:00.197 --> 29:02.490
and makes a chimney of his nose."

29:04.159 --> 29:05.660
Good, peek.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.663
So if one of 'em sees you,
they give up attendance forever.

29:08.831 --> 29:12.333
I suppose you didn't come to peek in.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.586
I came to shit in the privy,

29:15.754 --> 29:18.673
which is where you're supposed
to be during school hours.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.509
How does it feel to take one sitting up?

29:34.356 --> 29:38.192
Martha: "The Jews burn sacrifices
upon an altar of stone."

29:38.360 --> 29:42.780
The Jews burn sacrifices upon
an altar of stone.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.415
Altars of the kind
in the sentence are spelled

29:52.583 --> 29:54.459
T-A-R.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.463
It's not so important
always to be right, Mary,

29:58.630 --> 30:00.673
or to be first.

30:08.724 --> 30:13.060
(clears throat)
"Indians are sometimes very cruel."

30:15.147 --> 30:17.815
- I'm pulling out as a candidate.
- No, you aren't.

30:17.983 --> 30:22.153
He'll use knowing to try to control me,
have his way in the camp's affairs.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.905
He asked me to get her to sell.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.158
Oh, best leave the camp entirely
as penance for having a prick.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.411
You were right about the killing.
He didn't want it pursued.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.623
- (door closes)
- Bleeding?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.000
- He stopped.
- Put him up on the fucking bed then.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.503
No grand gestures, fucking Bullock,

30:38.670 --> 30:41.672
till I've had my talk with Hearst.
Do not fucking withdraw.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.926
And no more beating up
on Farnum that has to run against Star.

30:52.267 --> 30:56.270
It's no certainty Hearst knew one goddamned
thing about Bullock putting it to the widow.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.356
Hell of a beating for EB to take
if he's innocent.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.149
He's still way ahead of the game.

31:00.317 --> 31:04.529
Nonetheless, we must now assume
that Hearst does fucking know.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.616
As going mad in front of him, Bullock might
have tipped him as to the state of things.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.661
- How are you gonna go at Hearst?
- Don't I yearn for the days

31:11.828 --> 31:14.956
a draw across the throat
made fucking resolution?

31:18.085 --> 31:22.046
Why, Dan, by composing my thoughts,
tropes and gambits

31:22.214 --> 31:25.716
for the talk between us
that is yet to come.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.638
Will you excuse me?

31:31.974 --> 31:33.975
Sure.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.235
- Is she dying?
- She's not in imminent danger.

31:45.279 --> 31:46.904
The baby?

31:47.072 --> 31:49.907
Your wife is still with child.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.326
I saw the blood on the floor.

31:52.494 --> 31:55.705
There wasn't as much blood
as I'm sure it seemed to you.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.375
Mrs. Ellsworth must remain abed,

31:59.543 --> 32:02.628
and she must take the medicine
I've given her,

32:02.796 --> 32:07.633
her fear of it notwithstanding.
And you must remain strong at her side.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.180
I have to collect the child.
May I ask you to st--

32:13.348 --> 32:17.184
I'll stay here till you come back,
and then I'll go collect Trixie to help you.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.604
Thank you, Doctor.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.236
Who the fuck are all these people?

32:27.404 --> 32:29.572
Guess the stages
are gonna be crowded.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.199
Headed to collect the missus?

32:39.875 --> 32:41.834
(sighs)

32:44.296 --> 32:46.422
I just beat Farnum.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.221
Meeting Hearst,
I got the idea someone

32:54.389 --> 32:56.307
had told him business of mine.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.142
Figured it was Farnum?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.728
If it'd been me,
I'da gone ahead and killed him.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.105
I wonder now if I might have mistook--

33:03.273 --> 33:05.900
- Fuck Farnum anyway.
- If I tipped Hearst myself,

33:06.068 --> 33:08.444
- is what I'm wondering now.
- Ah.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.155
And of my temper generally,
I'm wondering about--

33:11.323 --> 33:13.032
far as running for office.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.701
Maybe you just don't
want to speak tonight.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.287
I know I don't want to speak.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.832
I'm wondering if
I ought to withdraw.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.796
Talking against my own interests--

33:26.963 --> 33:30.299
being if you pull out, I won't have
to speak from the audience--

33:30.467 --> 33:32.927
far as conversing with your rival,

33:33.095 --> 33:36.347
what's your best fuckin' experience?

33:36.515 --> 33:39.934
- Harry Manning?
- Huh.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.645
I guess that once
the two of us talked to him.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.147
When he killed
Bummer Dan by mistake.

33:45.315 --> 33:48.359
And that was high fucking water.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.070
So you'd hold me as fair

33:51.238 --> 33:55.241
calling Harry fucking outright dimwitted?

33:57.119 --> 34:00.121
You think better than the sheriff
with a shortish temper,

34:00.288 --> 34:05.126
which in certain
sheriffing situations is a plus,

34:05.293 --> 34:07.795
camp be better with Harry?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.137
(sighs)
Anyways.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.931
You gonna have dinner with us?

34:21.351 --> 34:24.520
May be my last fucking meal
if apoplexy takes me...

34:24.688 --> 34:26.856
off my nervousness.
(chuckles)

34:33.697 --> 34:35.989
What if you won?

34:36.158 --> 34:39.659
I won't. I'm only in it
to make myself known.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.204
Say you're fucking elected, Harry,

34:42.371 --> 34:45.081
am I entitled to
the fucking livery abandoned

34:45.250 --> 34:48.418
by the nigger Hostetler
leaving its stock to starve?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.920
Well, I know you've took up its care.

34:51.089 --> 34:55.009
And do you as sheriff hold
my fucking labor speaks for me,

34:55.177 --> 34:58.429
my diligent fuckin' efforts
the last six fuckin' weeks?

34:58.597 --> 35:02.725
Well, uh, I'd hold with the law, Steve,
whatever statute applied.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.770
Well, oughtn't a "statue"
have to do with justice

35:05.937 --> 35:08.439
and not just to bait back
a fled fucking nigger

35:08.607 --> 35:10.816
looking to steal what
a white man's worked for?

35:10.984 --> 35:14.111
Well, Hostetler ain't come back.
Why think he ever will?

35:14.279 --> 35:16.238
Because it's my family luck

35:16.406 --> 35:18.532
over centuries

35:18.700 --> 35:21.535
to get repeatedly fucked up the ass.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.913
And here in this fucking camp

35:24.080 --> 35:26.248
is where the chain
gets fucking broken.

35:26.416 --> 35:30.795
And I'm askin' if you as sheriff
will stand with me?!

35:33.381 --> 35:35.132
Yeah, I ain't sheriff.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.134
I got problems enough today

35:37.302 --> 35:39.762
without kiting checks
on tomorrow's.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.224
That was a wiggle

35:43.391 --> 35:46.519
worthy of a fucking reptile, Harry.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.316
- Bullock took a position?
- I ain't asked Bullock!

35:52.484 --> 35:55.069
Fool that I am, I figured
I'd give you first crack

35:55.237 --> 35:57.822
on the basis of our friendship.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.115
But I guess I was mistaken.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.076
(spits)

36:06.373 --> 36:08.874
I've got an idea.

36:09.042 --> 36:12.711
Instead of running for office
and tending bar,

36:12.879 --> 36:15.339
why don't you just tend bar

36:15.507 --> 36:17.758
and let everybody
punch you in the face?

36:26.393 --> 36:28.394
Hello, Jane.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.024
Yeah, hello.

36:39.406 --> 36:42.867
Several of the children's parents have
told them you scouted for Custer.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.202
I can't hear you!

36:46.997 --> 36:50.749
Several of the children's parents have
told them you scouted for Custer.

36:50.917 --> 36:55.254
Not that the arrogant bastard
ever heeded others' counsel.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.801
Shall we fashion a story
about your experiences, Jane,

37:00.969 --> 37:02.928
for the children to hear?

37:03.096 --> 37:06.348
Do you talk this low when
you're teaching the children?

37:08.476 --> 37:11.729
Shall we fashion a story
about your experiences, Jane,

37:11.897 --> 37:13.731
for the children to hear?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.318
Uh, I best say no.

37:18.528 --> 37:21.322
My funds just now all go for liquor.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.324
I see.

37:23.491 --> 37:27.369
I fine myself for swearing
amongst the young.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.790
And just now,
I need my money for booze.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.503
We'd tell your story to avoid those.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.427
Does that Mose Manuel
horrify the children?

37:43.595 --> 37:46.013
- No.
- Gives 'em bad dreams at night?

37:46.181 --> 37:50.100
- No, the children like Mose.
- I expect he pisses you off.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.602
No.
(chuckles)

37:51.770 --> 37:54.188
Well, he irritates the hell out of me.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.690
Oh, I was just going, Sheriff.

37:56.858 --> 37:59.818
I thought I left a bottle in here.

37:59.986 --> 38:03.614
Must've left it in the shitpile outside.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.449
Goodbye, Jane.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.663
Good afternoon.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.873
How was your meeting
with Mr. Hearst?

38:30.266 --> 38:33.310
We needn't be afraid
is the main thing.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.939
She'll not be of a sudden

38:37.107 --> 38:39.108
taken or the like.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.360
The doctor's guaranteed it.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.905
So when we're with her,

38:45.073 --> 38:47.408
we needn't be worried.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.452
(footsteps)

39:06.428 --> 39:08.429
Do you want to keep it?

39:10.890 --> 39:13.142
May not be a matter
of my choosing.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.520
As I suppose we both fucking know.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.148
I'm asking...

39:19.315 --> 39:21.483
if all the way down,

39:21.651 --> 39:23.694
you want to bring it into the world.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.654
I want it very much.

39:25.822 --> 39:29.158
Or if an accident befalling
or fate intervening or--

39:29.325 --> 39:31.994
however you want
to fucking put it,

39:32.162 --> 39:34.955
might find a small
part of you relieved.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.333
I want my baby.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.170
Then you're gonna
lay down and be spoiled

39:41.337 --> 39:43.797
and put off proving
what else you can do

39:43.965 --> 39:46.633
until after you've popped out this kid.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.096
(groans)

39:52.474 --> 39:55.267
(shallow breathing)

39:55.435 --> 39:57.019
(grunts)

39:57.187 --> 39:59.813
"Voters of the camp,

39:59.981 --> 40:02.816
do you see come before you

40:02.984 --> 40:05.944
some swollen
and dissolute stranger?

40:06.112 --> 40:09.656
Do not mistake--"
(groans)

40:09.824 --> 40:12.409
"It is I, EB Farnum!"

40:12.577 --> 40:14.328
Lie back, EB.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.413
"Beaten past recognition by

40:16.581 --> 40:18.957
a candidate for another office."

40:19.125 --> 40:21.418
Lie the fuck back...

40:21.586 --> 40:24.171
- (groans)
- ...and listen.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.841
I need your truthful reply.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.426
Lie, I will know it,

40:29.594 --> 40:31.386
and death will be no respite.

40:31.554 --> 40:35.265
I told Hearst nothing
of Bullock and the widow.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.268
I will profane
your fucking remains, EB.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.563
- Not my remains, Al.
- Gabriel's trumpet will produce you

40:41.731 --> 40:43.565
from the ass of a pig.

40:43.733 --> 40:47.486
You told me not to tell him,
and I didn't.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.698
I believe you.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.910
My pain is such
that gives me no solace.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.204
Try not to blame Bullock
for presuming it was you,

40:57.372 --> 40:59.456
considering your fucking history.

40:59.624 --> 41:02.584
Anyways, tonight's speeches
are fucking canceled.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.837
- Nurse your fuckin' wounds.
- Thank you.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.797
I do not mean here.

41:06.965 --> 41:10.551
All right. Let me collect myself.
(chuckles)

41:13.388 --> 41:16.181
Cocksuckers.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.267
(shudders)

41:18.434 --> 41:20.602
- (whores laughing)
- (door shuts)

41:20.770 --> 41:23.105
(piano music playing)

41:40.790 --> 41:42.749
Say what you have to say...

41:44.627 --> 41:47.212
Again for Merrick, Dan. Gratis.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.339
Uh, I'm due no special thanks, Al.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.925
Facilitating presentation of the candidates

41:52.093 --> 41:54.136
is the honor and privilege
of the press.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.263
That's off, the presentation.

41:56.431 --> 42:00.142
Is Farnum incapable of speech?
Does Star refuse to take advantage?

42:00.310 --> 42:03.854
- Other factors at play.
- But surely Bullock and Harry Manning

42:04.022 --> 42:06.815
- still can take to the hustings.
- I got to notify the parties.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.609
I'm an interested party too, Al,

42:08.776 --> 42:10.277
and I require explanation.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.738
Jesus Christ.
How interested are you?

42:12.906 --> 42:16.283
Enough to bleed to keep the business
from being a fucking puppet show?

42:16.451 --> 42:20.287
I can imagine bleeding,
if first I've been made to understand.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.539
No one asked if you
could imagine bleeding,

42:22.707 --> 42:26.376
or if you'd have tumbling or somersaults
or cartwheels to bring you into the lists.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.631
Drink and fuck on the house,
but do not attempt to detain me.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.732
In what state?

42:49.859 --> 42:52.319
We ain't in a state, Shaunessey.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.446
What condition? The room?

42:54.614 --> 42:56.865
How much disarray?

42:57.033 --> 42:59.159
No fucking disarray.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.703
But you nearly had brain on your walls.

43:01.871 --> 43:04.581
Ooh!

43:10.171 --> 43:12.172
Al:
You see me empty, sir,

43:12.340 --> 43:14.174
do not pause and inquire,

43:14.342 --> 43:16.927
simply assume and refill.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.930
(chuckles)

43:20.098 --> 43:22.516
Would you rather
we spoke in private?

43:22.684 --> 43:26.436
- Fuck, no. I'd rather the gentleman stay.
- Captain Turner.

43:26.604 --> 43:31.608
I'd rather the captain stay.
Brings home I consort with my betters.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.695
I'll not dissemble, sir,

43:34.862 --> 43:37.447
today's events have gave me pause.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.950
Hmm. Tell me what you mean.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.369
The beating of Farnum most recently.

43:42.537 --> 43:43.912
How is Mr. Farnum?

43:44.080 --> 43:46.873
Worse for wear, not that I'd care
if he weren't in your hire.

43:47.041 --> 43:50.043
Where does the sheriff get off
taking off on one of your own?

43:50.211 --> 43:52.796
I don't consider Bullock
came here to beat Farnum.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.840
He and I had appointed to meet.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.342
In my joint this morning,
another of your workers

43:57.510 --> 43:59.594
- was gut-shot, Mr. Hearst.
- Yes, I know.

43:59.762 --> 44:04.099
Now this wasn't some hoople-head bullshit.
This had the feel of a put-up job.

44:04.267 --> 44:06.018
I fear a plot against you.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.396
I have learned to accept,
Mr. Swearengen,

44:09.564 --> 44:12.691
that events sharing some effect
on my interests

44:12.859 --> 44:14.901
does not make them part of a plot.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.404
You ain't the center
of the universe, in other words.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.072
Exactly.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.075
- Don't that lead you to despair?
- No, sir.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.995
(chuckles)
You're stronger-minded than I.

44:25.163 --> 44:28.498
Bullock beating Farnum
seems more likely

44:28.666 --> 44:31.793
some expression of
a private feeling of his own.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.713
That leaves the bloodshed
in my bar, sir.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.631
How do you account for that?

44:36.799 --> 44:39.801
Nor are the Cornish
well-loved as a race.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.511
Oh, not you through the Cornish,

44:41.679 --> 44:44.514
maybe the Cornish themselves
were the object of the violence.

44:44.682 --> 44:49.102
They do tend to aggregate and organize

44:49.270 --> 44:53.482
- to further their financial interests.
- Unions.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.942
Have you strong feelings
on that subject?

44:56.110 --> 44:58.028
I don't give a fuck
about unions, Mr. Hearst.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.906
Nor do I have any objection
to the killing of the Cornish

45:01.074 --> 45:04.659
as high-graders--
aggregating organizing cocksuckers.

45:04.827 --> 45:08.038
But bloodletting on my premises
that I ain't approved

45:08.206 --> 45:10.374
I take as a fucking affront.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.793
It puts me off my feed.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.840
How do we know
when you are off your feed?

45:19.008 --> 45:21.259
You'll start to see me
tearing things down.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.888
Speeches tonight are canceled.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.224
Unless the insult's cured by tomorrow,

45:27.392 --> 45:29.267
there'll be further tearing down.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.729
Fuck the fucking elections,
and fuck the agreement with Yankton.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.482
Let the camp return to its former repute:

45:35.650 --> 45:39.778
- unstable and unsafe for commerce.
- I'm a great believer in those.

45:39.946 --> 45:42.489
Oh, stability, sir, and commerce?
I can fucking imagine.

45:42.657 --> 45:46.076
- Think of all they've helped you accomplish.
- Shall I perceive you then

45:46.244 --> 45:48.203
as dangerous to my interests?

45:48.371 --> 45:50.747
As capable of inconvenience

45:50.915 --> 45:52.791
and of some damage and death

45:52.959 --> 45:55.419
to those that would act
against my interests,

45:55.586 --> 45:57.546
I cannot fucking argue with dangerous.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.006
Different from powerful though,

46:00.174 --> 46:03.009
which speaks to potency longer term.

46:03.177 --> 46:07.305
I'd not have myself called powerful
in your company or the captain's.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.183
Then I'll hope
that your insult is cured

46:10.351 --> 46:13.353
to spare the camp any danger

46:13.521 --> 46:16.565
of however brief a duration.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.734
And to look for one fucking instant

46:19.902 --> 46:21.987
out of the other end of the telescope,

46:22.155 --> 46:24.364
once placated...

46:26.576 --> 46:29.536
I'm meek as a babe.

46:33.416 --> 46:35.250
Dead.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.922
(sighs)

46:41.090 --> 46:42.716
(door slams)

46:44.010 --> 46:45.844
You will want to converse

46:46.012 --> 46:48.555
with those friends
of yours, Captain Turner,

46:48.723 --> 46:51.558
who argued with the Cornish.

46:51.726 --> 46:55.061
Perhaps they'd care to pay
another visit to the saloon.

46:56.689 --> 46:59.691
I think I'll want to hear the talk.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.237
Fucking pagan.

47:04.405 --> 47:06.865
Tell your god to ready for blood.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.667
Charlie:
"Thank you, Sheriff Bullock.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.086
Evening.
Evening, everybody."

47:20.254 --> 47:22.631
(muttering speech)
"Citizens..."

47:27.178 --> 47:30.263
Would you rather I didn't
introduce you from the audience?

47:30.431 --> 47:33.266
Is it all so hard to remember?

47:33.434 --> 47:35.644
No, I, uh, I-I think I got it.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.439
Unless you don't wanna.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.276
Ought we to start soon
for the hustings?

47:43.444 --> 47:45.111
Five minutes.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.203
Adams may default on that house.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.914
Asks me to assume his note.

47:56.082 --> 47:59.084
That's a very pleasant house.

47:59.252 --> 48:02.045
Uh, I-I'd...

48:02.213 --> 48:04.673
never thought of myself
as a homeowner.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.424
It's very very spacious.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.510
(knocks on door)

48:08.678 --> 48:11.012
It's Albert Swearengen.

48:18.646 --> 48:21.982
The speeches are postponed.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.401
Is Farnum turned for the worse?

48:27.989 --> 48:30.323
I'd borrow the sheriff a moment.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.625
Evening, Jane.

48:40.793 --> 48:44.504
Mrs. Bullock asks me
to author with her

48:44.672 --> 48:48.008
to give the children an account
of my scouting for Custer.

48:48.175 --> 48:51.845
I think I'd like to hear
that story myself.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.180
(scratching)

48:54.348 --> 48:57.684
"Custer was a cunt. The end."

48:57.852 --> 49:01.021
Yo, a piss puddle.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.859
Must not have seen that
when seating myself.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.653
Why are you drinking so much?

49:08.821 --> 49:11.531
I drink what I'm able.

49:11.699 --> 49:14.409
If that comes to much--
(sniffles)

49:14.577 --> 49:16.661
that's the day's affair and the liquor's.

49:19.248 --> 49:21.875
You returning to the Bella Union?

49:22.043 --> 49:23.710
Not tonight.

49:23.878 --> 49:27.797
As residence and workplace
is my meaning.

49:29.050 --> 49:31.051
Those girls need looking out for.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.136
And who will look out for you

49:33.304 --> 49:36.097
against that gut-stabbed cocksucker,

49:36.265 --> 49:39.517
weaving schemes
from his coming to Jesus?

49:39.685 --> 49:41.436
I don't know.

49:41.604 --> 49:46.024
Why is everybody fucking
whispering all of a sudden?!

49:46.192 --> 49:48.943
I said I don't know.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.198
Do you mind...

49:53.366 --> 49:55.867
if I stay here tonight?

49:56.035 --> 49:58.828
I'd be glad if you would.

49:58.996 --> 50:03.041
I don't know why you started
sleeping outside anyway.

50:13.844 --> 50:18.223
Every day takes figuring out
all over again how to fucking live.

50:24.605 --> 50:27.273
Night, Jane.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.442
Yep.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.411
Pain-in-the-balls Hearst.

50:39.578 --> 50:41.705
Running his holdings
like a despot, I grant,

50:41.872 --> 50:44.457
has a fucking logic.
It's the way I fucking run mine.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.918
It's the way I'd run my home
if I fucking had one.

50:47.086 --> 50:50.088
But there's no practical need for him
to run the fucking camp.

50:50.256 --> 50:52.966
That's out of scale,
it's out of proportion

50:53.134 --> 50:55.051
and it's a warped unnatural impulse,

50:55.219 --> 50:57.262
this fucking cocksucker!

50:57.430 --> 50:59.264
Sorry.

51:01.142 --> 51:03.017
Shall I go back down with you?

51:03.185 --> 51:05.145
It won't be just now.

51:05.312 --> 51:08.356
He'll be wanting to marshal
his cutthroats.

51:16.449 --> 51:19.117
Do stay in hailing distance.
