   WHEN DESCRIBING SOMETHING

00:33.534 --> 00:36.301

     OF HEATED COMPETITION.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.636

I'M SURE YOU'LL CLEAN UP NICELY,
           WON'T YOU?

       YOU LET IT HAPPEN.
        YOU LET HIM WIN.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.406
      - I WAS ON HIS TEAM.
  IT WAS A VICTORY FOR ME TOO.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.408
  AND HE WAS JUST SHOWING OFF
           FOR FIONA.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.444
  - OH, WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY
      SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

02:25.446 --> 02:27.579
      - SO HE DATES FIONA.
       WHAT DO YOU CARE?

02:27.581 --> 02:30.249
     - THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
   THAT WOULD END: DISASTER.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.317
      - MAYBE THEY GO OUT,
  AND THEY FALL MADLY IN LOVE.

         A COUPLE TIMES

02:46.700 --> 02:50.636
    - THAT IS ALSO VERY BAD.
   LET ME EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.172
   SHE DOESN'T TAKE IT WELL.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.606
   SHE'S SAD AND VULNERABLE,

     BE INTERESTED IN T.J.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.922
          - IT'S T.J.
    - THIS WAS A GOOD TALK.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.923
           THANK YOU.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.192

03:14.394 --> 03:16.361
             OKAY.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.362
            - HELLO.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.764
             I KNOW
    IT'S A BIT PRESUMPTUOUS,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.199
       BUT AS YOU'RE NOT
       GOING OUT TONIGHT,

03:20.201 --> 03:21.433
     CAN YOU WATCH MARCUS?

03:21.435 --> 03:24.536
     'CAUSE MY USUAL SITTER
        JUST CANCELLED.

          AT MY BOOBS?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.773
          - UH, WHAT?
            NO, NO.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.308
      I MEAN, I DID, YES,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.976
    BUT IT'S JUST A REFLEX,
     SO DON'T BE FLATTERED.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.611
      - DOES THE FACT THAT
  I'M NOW COVERING UP MY BOOBS

03:32.613 --> 03:33.712
       SUGGEST FLATTERY?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.215
        - WELL, YOU'RE--
       YOU'RE DRESSED UP.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.950
  WHY--WHY ARE YOU DRESSED UP?
      - OH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:37.952 --> 03:41.253
    I JUST, YOU KNOW, WANTED
  TO LOOK NICE FOR GAME NIGHT.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.456
       WHAT ABOUT MARCUS?
      - UH, LET ME THINK.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.259
  WHAT--WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
- CAN YOU WATCH MARCUS TONIGHT?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.994
     - NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T.
    I'M GONNA BE AT ANDY'S.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.230
   - BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID--
      - NO, I LOVE GAMES.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.965
       I LOVE GAME NIGHT.
    I LOVE THE WHOLE THING.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.333
     SO I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.734
         - OKAY, WELL,
      I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.636
          I'M ACTUALLY
  QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.671
         I LOVE GAMES.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.373
          DID YOU JUST
    LOOK AT MY BOOBS AGAIN?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.442

        YOU BROUGHT 'EM.
           ALL RIGHT?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.880
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 YOU CAN'T COME TO GAME NIGHT.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.782
          ODD NUMBERS.
       LAURIE WILL FREAK.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.352
     LAURIE WILL FREAK OUT.
 - DID YOU JUST SEE HER OUTFIT?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.954
   I NEED TO STOP THIS, ANDY.
        - I DON'T CARE.

04:16.957 --> 04:21.026
   THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY
      FOR ME TO HAVE SEX.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.694
   - WHAT KIND OF GAME NIGHT
            IS THIS?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.030
  - IT'S THE KIND WHERE LAURIE
      GETS IN A GOOD MOOD.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.299
     SHE'S GOT A WINE BUZZ
           GOING ON.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.334
   GRANDPARENTS HAVE THE KIDS
           ALL NIGHT.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.402
       THEN ODD NUMBERS--

04:30.404 --> 04:31.970
          ODD NUMBERS
     RUIN THE WHOLE THING.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.039
          - ALL RIGHT,
       I'LL BRING A DATE.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.474
       - NO PROSTITUTES.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.676
         - OH, THIS ONE
   SOUNDS KIND OF PROMISING.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.311
       JANINE ROTTERDALE.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.812
       YOU PUT FOUR STARS
       NEXT TO HER NAME.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.347
      - WELL, THOSE AREN'T
       THE KIND OF STARS

04:42.349 --> 04:44.383
         YOU CAN BRING
    TO A GAME NIGHT, MARCUS.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.320
          WHO'S NEXT?
       - CASSANDRA KRULL.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.955
          - HER FORTE
    REALLY ISN'T GAME NIGHT,

04:49.957 --> 04:52.324
    ALTHOUGH SHE DOES EXCEL
        IN OTHER AREAS.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.992
        - MISTY LAUREL?
            - UH...

04:53.994 --> 04:55.360
         - DAKOTA GLEN?

04:55.362 --> 04:58.664
        THE GIRL I BRING
      NEEDS TO BE AWESOME.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.998
        SHE NEEDS TO BE
       THE TOTAL PACKAGE,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.567
   SOMEONE WHO CAN BEAT T.J.
        INTO HUMILIATION

05:02.569 --> 05:04.369
   BUT STILL KEEP THE NIGHT,
         YOU KNOW, FUN.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.973
     SHE NEEDS TO BE LIKE--
      - DR. SAMANTHA LAKE.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.741
     SHE'S THE NEXT PERSON
       IN YOUR CONTACTS.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.643
            - YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.046
     MY SITUATION WITH SAM
IS WAY TOO PRECARIOUS RIGHT NOW.

05:14.048 --> 05:18.050
I CAN'T HAVE LAURIE INSULTING ME
  AND T.J. HITTING ON SOMEONE.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.319
  WHEN I MAKE MY MOVE ON SAM,
    IT NEEDS TO BE PERFECT.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.688
         - HI, DR. SAM.
        THIS IS MARCUS.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.790
      WILL'S BEST FRIEND.
         - HEY, MARCUS.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.693
       - MARCUS, TELL ME
   YOU DID NOT JUST CALL SAM.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.594
         - OKAY, OKAY,
     SO WILL WAS WONDERING

05:29.596 --> 05:31.697
   IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN HIM
    FOR GAME NIGHT TONIGHT.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.498
           - MARCUS.
        - ANDY'S HOUSE.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.367
    - GAME NIGHT, SERIOUSLY?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.336
           LIKE WHAT,
         SCATTERGORIES?

05:37.338 --> 05:40.439
       - SHE'S WONDERING
   IF YOU PLAY SCATTERGORIES.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.840
      - I DON'T EVEN KNOW
         WHAT THAT IS.

05:41.842 --> 05:42.874
            - OKAY,
   WE'RE A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR

05:42.876 --> 05:45.477
     BUT WILL NEEDS A DATE,
       LIKE, REALLY BAD.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.478
            - JUST--

05:46.480 --> 05:50.015
   AND BY SOME MINOR MIRACLE,
 I ACTUALLY HAVE THE NIGHT OFF,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.718
   SO JUST HAVE WILL SEND ME
           THE DEETS,

05:52.720 --> 05:54.086
       AND I'LL BE THERE
      WHEN MY SHIFT ENDS.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.988
     - SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
         SHE SAID YES.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.826
    - DON'T YOU EVER, EVER,
      EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.928
     DID SHE SOUND EXCITED?
            - YEAH.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.463
            - COOL.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.998
     - JUST ONE MORE TIME.
      JUST ONE MORE TIME.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.535
        [knock at door]

06:13.039 --> 06:14.840
      - OH, THERE SHE IS.
        - YOU'RE ALONE.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.409
   - YOU LOOK LOVELY TONIGHT.
       LOOK AT THAT BELT.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.678
  THAT'S A CUTE LITTLE BUTTON
 YOU GOT THERE ON YOUR SLEEVE.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.013
        - WHAT IS THIS?
      WHAT ARE WE PLAYING?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.048
    - JUST PLAYING THE GAMES
    YOU'RE PROVIDING TONIGHT

06:23.050 --> 06:24.683
  AND EXCITED TO BE DOING SO.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.551
   - YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT,
  BUT THE ORCHID IS BEAUTIFUL.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.554
        I'M TAKING THIS
           AND THIS.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.922
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.091
       DO NOT ENGAGE HER.
    - I WAS JUST BEING NICE.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.860
      - WHAT'S YOUR GAME?
     WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.128
        - YOU ARE WORSE
        THAN YOUR WIFE.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.063
          OKAY, LOOK,
   DR. SAM IS COMING TONIGHT,

06:38.065 --> 06:39.998
   AND I JUST NEED EVERYTHING
          TO GO WELL.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.666
     - NOT AS MUCH AS I DO.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.969
      WHEN LAURIE'S HAPPY,
         ANDY'S HAPPY.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.003
          - BEAUTIFUL.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.605
    WELL, THEN WE'RE A TEAM,
           ALL RIGHT?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.774
          BRING IT IN.
         COME ON, NOW.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.108
 - HELLO, PEOPLE OF GAME NIGHT!

06:50.110 --> 06:51.143
           - OH, MY.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.411
        IS HE WEARING--
          - [groaning]

06:52.413 --> 06:53.545
         - WOW, REALLY?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.046
     YEAH, YOU BROUGHT IT.
          THAT'S GOOD.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.515
    THAT'S A REAL CLASS ACT.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.084
         - YO, YO, YO,
  RICHARD AND RICHARD'S WIFE.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.487
           IT'S ANN.
  I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A DECADE.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.657
   - YOU WERE AT OUR WEDDING.
     - AND WHERE IS MILADY?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.526
 - YOU GOT TO STOP SAYING THAT,
        DUDE, ALL RIGHT?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.860
       IT'S GETTING OLD.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.796
  - SHE'S DROPPING MARCUS OFF
    AT THE BABYSITTER, HON.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.564
        - OH, RIGHTEOUS.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.933
    MAMA'S GOT A HALL PASS.
            - NICE.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.036
 YOU THINK YOU GOT A HALL PASS?
   I'M A CHAPERONE FROM HELL.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.605
     - SHE'S NICE--CHERYL.
        YOU'LL LIKE HER.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.141
     I MET HER VOLUNTEERING
     AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.077
   - THIS HOUSE IS TOO NICE.
      IT FEELS UNSETTLING.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.546
         - OH, DARLING,
      IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.681
   SHE'S GOT THREE DAUGHTERS.
      YOU MIGHT HAVE FUN.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.152
          HI, CHERYL.
             - HI.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.021
      - YOU'RE A LIFESAVER
       FOR TAKING MARCUS.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.589
           THANK YOU.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.930
  - THEY MUST KEEP CINDERELLA
          IN THE BACK.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.164
       - GOOD WIN TODAY.
          HARD FOUGHT.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.033
         PUT IT THERE.
      - WHAT'S YOUR GAME?

07:48.035 --> 07:49.100
           - NOTHING.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.902
             - OH.
  - NOW THAT YOU BRING IT UP,

07:50.904 --> 07:52.237
  I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
        ABOUT SOMETHING.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.638
            - PSST.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.041
           OH, BUDDY.
           IT IS ON.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.743
 - YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING WITH HER.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.512
           - MILADY.
           - [groans]

08:00.514 --> 08:03.215
  - THAT'S REALLY FUN TO SAY.

08:05.084 --> 08:08.019
  - YOU GUYS, T.J. AND FIONA,
        IT'S HAPPENING.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.689
  - IT IS NOT HAPPENING, OKAY?
            - IT IS.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.990
       ANDY, TIEBREAKER.
        WHAT DO YOU SEE?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.092
    - I SEE LOVE BLOSSOMING.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.062
           - [gasps]
     GOD, THIS TURNS ME ON.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.663
          - I THOUGHT
   YOU WERE ON MY TEAM, MAN.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.065
     - JUST SWITCHED SIDES.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.600
     - HOW OLD DO YOU THINK
             HE IS?

08:21.602 --> 08:25.003
         - I'M GUESSING
     HE'S A VERY PALE NINE.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.739
          - ACTUALLY,
    I'M A SLIGHTLY PALE 11.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.708
  - WE'RE NOT TALKING TO YOU.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.110
    WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.
        - RIGHT, RIGHT.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.611
         SORRY, MA'AM.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.215
        - HE'S PERFECT.
         - PERFECT FOR?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.517
             SORRY.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.818
     - KATIE, GET IN HERE.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.090
          - OH, SORRY.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.194
              HI.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.664
       - ON THE OUTSIDE,
   I WAS ROOTING FOR MARCUS,

08:52.666 --> 08:53.665
       BUT ON THE INSIDE,

08:53.667 --> 08:54.833
      I WAS SORT OF HOPING

08:54.835 --> 08:56.835
        THAT'D YOU BEAT
     THE CRAP OUT OF WILL.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.672
       - [chuckles] WELL,
YOU'RE VERY SMOOTH, AREN'T YOU?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.274
    - FIONA, I THINK TONIGHT
  WE'RE GONNA BE UNSTOPPABLE.

09:02.276 --> 09:05.143
  - OH, WITH YOUR GAME SKILLS
    AND MY WILLINGNESS TO DO

09:05.145 --> 09:07.045
   WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN,
           IT IS ON.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.314
         - HEY, FIONA.
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.216
      - FIONA, COULD I GET
 A WOMAN'S HELP IN THE KITCHEN?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.218
    - I NEED TO TALK TO HER.
             - NO.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.820
     YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
  WHERE YOUR SUPPOSED DATE IS.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.923
         GAMING STARTS
        IN FIVE MINUTES.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.292
     I NEED AN EVEN NUMBER.

09:20.294 --> 09:22.627
           - [sighs]

09:24.564 --> 09:26.932
            - OKAY.
    TELL ME WHAT I'M SEEING.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.301
       WHAT IS HAPPENING
       WITH YOU AND T.J.?

09:29.303 --> 09:30.835
       LOVING YOUR BOOBS,
          BY THE WAY.

09:30.837 --> 09:34.072
 - OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE COMING
  IN HERE TO CHOP VEGETABLES.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.707
             - NO.
      NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.977
         WE ARE TALKING
       ABOUT YOU AND T.J.

09:38.979 --> 09:39.978
     WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.780
- OH, ARE WE REALLY GONNA TALK--

09:41.782 --> 09:47.152
UM, WELL, WHAT SORT OF A PERSON
      DO YOU THINK HE IS?

09:47.154 --> 09:50.188
          DO YOU THINK
       THAT HE'S CARING,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.157
           THAT HE'S
     SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.225
          - HE'S HOT.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.027
   LET'S PRETEND ANDY'S DEAD
         FOR A SECOND.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.662
        JUST GOD FORBID.

09:57.664 --> 10:01.700
         I WOULD MOURN
FOR A RESPECTABLE MONTH OR TWO,

10:01.702 --> 10:04.636
  AND THEN I WOULD HIT THAT...

10:04.638 --> 10:06.705
             HARD.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.307
            SO HARD.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.178
          - WOULD YOU?
              HMM.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.916
           DON'T KNOW
  THAT HE'S THE SORT OF PERSON

10:17.918 --> 10:23.254
    BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING
  A LOT OF CHOOSING RECENTLY.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.756
           - MM-HMM.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.391
   - DOES HAVE A NICE LAUGH,
      THOUGH, DOESN'T HE?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.626
     CHEEKY LITTLE BUGGER.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.095
   - THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.098
        ANDY, MORE WINE.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.900
          - ALL RIGHT.
      HOW MY LADIES DOING?

10:35.902 --> 10:37.369
            - GOOD.
         THANKS, BABE.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.638
         THAT'S--OKAY.
         THAT'S A LOT.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.940
          both: WHOA.
           - [laughs]

10:41.942 --> 10:44.175
 - ALL RIGHT, WE CAN'T DO THIS
      WITH AN ODD NUMBER.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.210
     I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.045
            WILL...

10:47.047 --> 10:48.847
      YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.
      GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.815
  - SHE'S GONNA BE HERE SOON.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.017
    - WE DON'T HAVE TO START
          RIGHT AWAY.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.852
      I MEAN, WE CAN WAIT
    A COUPLE MINUTES, RIGHT?

10:53.854 --> 10:54.853
            - YEAH.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.321
            - ANDY,
    I'M GETTING VERY TENSE.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.089
     - WILL, PLEASE GET OUT
          OF MY HOUSE.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.658
   - T.J., CAN I TALK TO YOU
        IN THE KITCHEN?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.226
           ALL RIGHT,
          HERE WE GO.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.094
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
     - A LITTLE QUICK TALK.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.096
      DUDE, WHAT THE HELL
   ARE YOU DOING WITH FIONA?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.065
   - I'M TRYING TO LITERALLY
  CHARM THE PANTS OFF OF HER.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.066
     WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
           I'M DOING?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.068
         - WELL, DON'T.
             - WHY?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.037
  - BECAUSE I'M ASKING NICELY
     AND I'D APPRECIATE IT.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.039
           - [sighs]

11:14.041 --> 11:15.840
          I'M TOTALLY
      HITTING THAT LATER.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.909
        - T.J., DO NOT.
        DO NOT HIT THAT.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.044
 - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

11:19.046 --> 11:22.747
     WHAT, DO YOU LIKE HER
         OR SOMETHING?

11:22.749 --> 11:25.950
           - [sighs]

11:25.952 --> 11:27.318
              YES.
          - [chuckles]

11:27.320 --> 11:28.353
       - I LIKE HER, MAN.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.387
   I'VE BEEN CRUSHING SO HARD
            ON THAT.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.222
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.824
   I TOTALLY HAVE THIS THING.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.393
   IT'S LIKE--LIKE, YOU KNOW,
        I'M GOING CRAZY.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.896
 LIKE, MY HEART--PITTER PATTER.
     IT'S KIND OF EXCITING.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.031
          SO IT'S LIKE
    I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

11:40.033 --> 11:44.202
     IF YOU'D LET ME HAVE,
       YOU KNOW, MILADY.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.904
  - DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
            IN TAHOE

11:45.906 --> 11:47.772
      WHERE I CALLED DIBS
  ON THAT GIRL IN THE HOT TUB?

11:47.774 --> 11:48.907
   - YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE
         MORE SPECIFIC.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.209
 - YOU DIDN'T LET ME HAVE HER,
             OKAY,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.445
   AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
          HAVE FIONA.

11:53.447 --> 11:54.813
             - T.J.
    - AND IF YOU WANT HER...

11:54.815 --> 11:55.914
             - T.J.
      - THEN THAT'S FINE.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.782
        NEW COMPETITION.
             YEAH.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.484
     FIRST ONE TO BAG FIONA
         GETS THE BELT.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.087
            - WHAT?
 THAT IS SO DISRESPECTFUL, MAN.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.757
   THAT IS THE WOMAN THAT I--
          THAT I LOVE.

12:08.060 --> 12:08.293
               .

12:08.295 --> 12:12.797
       BIG FAN OF TRUTH.
       ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.798
     I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING
       YOU WANT TO KNOW.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.066
  - WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST FEAR?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.268
        - BESIDES THIS,
   I'D HAVE TO SAY IT'S A TIE

12:17.270 --> 12:20.371
      BETWEEN WATER SNAKES
          AND PEANUTS.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.406
        A SINGLE PEANUT
         COULD KILL ME.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.174
           - REALLY?
            ME TOO.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.876
 LIKE, INSTANT THROAT CLOSURE.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.344
           PISTACHIOS
      AND BRAZIL NUTS TOO.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.414
        - DUDE, NO WAY.
  ANY SORT OF TREE NUT FOR ME.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.983
  IF I'M EVEN IN THE SAME ROOM
         AS A CASHEW--

12:31.985 --> 12:34.419
           - ME TOO.
     LIKE, IMMEDIATE DEATH.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.288
     - ALL RIGHT, MY TURN.
     KATIE, TRUTH OR DARE?

12:37.290 --> 12:41.059
  - I DARE YOU TO KISS MARCUS.
            - BUT--

12:41.061 --> 12:44.162
          - I DARE YOU
        TO KISS MARCUS.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.833
      - SINCE WE ONLY HAVE
         AN ODD NUMBER,

12:48.835 --> 12:50.335
   THE ONLY THING WE CAN PLAY
       IS CHARADES, SO...

12:50.337 --> 12:54.939
     - I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
    NO OTHER SEATS ANYWHERE.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.107
            - WILL.
        - IT'S ALL GOOD.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.408
      - FIRST UP IS WILL.
             WILL.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.846
     - HE CALLED YOUR NAME.
     [overlapping chatter]

13:01.848 --> 13:03.181
        - LET'S DO THIS.
        - COME ON, WILL.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.249
         - HERE WE GO.
          - GO, WILL.

13:04.251 --> 13:08.820
       - WHAT DO WE GOT?
             UM...

13:08.822 --> 13:10.922
            - RIGHT.
       WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.524
          - [chuckles]
 - CAN'T BELIEVE HIM SOMETIMES.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.259
         - HERE WE GO.
       - ALL RIGHT, UH...

13:14.261 --> 13:15.493
   I'M GOING TO GO LIKE THIS.
           - DRIVING.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.395
          - SHOOTING.
           - DRIVING.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.298
     - NO, NO, JUST KEEP--
           - DIVING.

13:20.300 --> 13:25.904
     [overlapping chatter]

13:25.906 --> 13:27.438
      - A VERY ANGRY MAN.
        -<i> COLOR PURPLE.</i>

13:27.440 --> 13:28.907
            - UH...
          - ANGRY MAN.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.342
        - MAKE A SIGNAL.
            - WHAT?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.278
       - ALL RIGHT, T.J.,
  GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, MAN.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.079
       HONESTLY, STOP IT.
            - WILL.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.080
      - FIONA, I'M SORRY.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.415
         I'M SO SORRY,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.417
        BUT I FORBID YOU
       TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.486
    - DID YOU JUST FORBID ME
        TO DO SOMETHING?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.888
   - I FORBID YOU TO DO T.J.
              YES.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.824
  - OH, IT'S 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
     WANT ME IN YOUR WORLD,

13:45.826 --> 13:49.127
     IS IT REALLY SO AWFUL
        TO BE AROUND ME?

13:49.129 --> 13:51.563
 - NOPE, THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.
     HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

13:51.565 --> 13:54.432
           - [groans]
           all: WHAT?

13:54.434 --> 13:57.268
            - WHAT?
             - OH.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.571
              HEY.
          YOU MADE IT.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.105
           [laughter]

14:01.107 --> 14:02.373
      - AND DON'T COME OUT
  UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR DARE.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.142
         [both giggle]

14:04.144 --> 14:05.476
         [both smooch]

14:08.147 --> 14:10.315
           - SO, UH--
        SO WHAT IS THIS?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.883
            IS IT--
         IS IT GRANITE?

14:11.885 --> 14:13.551
     IT COULD BE SOAPSTONE.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.086
           YOU KNOW,
        WHATEVER IT IS,

14:15.088 --> 14:18.223
       THE CRAFTSMANSHIP
         IS IMPECCABLE.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.258
      - I'M SORRY, MARCUS.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.326
          I TRULY AM,

14:21.328 --> 14:23.628
       BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
          MY SISTERS.

14:23.630 --> 14:27.131
      THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
          OUT OF HERE.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.467
           - [sighs]

14:29.469 --> 14:32.270
           - EW, NO.

14:32.272 --> 14:36.107
      I TOOK THESE PEANUTS
        FROM THE PANTRY.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.276
        WE EACH EAT ONE
           TOGETHER.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.545
   - I NEVER THOUGHT TONIGHT
 WOULD END WITH A SUICIDE PACT.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.347
       BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.648
     THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.917
   AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

14:45.919 --> 14:47.919
    THAT IT WAS REALLY NICE
          MEETING YOU.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.320
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.156
          YOU'RE NICE.
   - YOU'RE NICE TOO, MARCUS.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.295
          - YOU KNOW,

14:57.297 --> 15:01.566
      THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
          OUT OF HERE.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.569
         WE COULD FLY.
        - WE COULD LIE.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.039
 WAIT, DID YOU JUST SAY "FLY"?
         I SAID "LIE."

15:08.041 --> 15:09.641
        - THAT'S BETTER.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.376
        - EVERYTHING HAS
     AN EXPLANATION, OKAY?

15:11.378 --> 15:13.177
   - I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
        I'M GONNA LEAVE.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.480
- WE FINALLY HAVE EVEN NUMBERS.
            PLEASE.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.916
       - ANDY, LET IT GO.
      GAME NIGHT IS OVER.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.386
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY JUST SIT
         THE HELL DOWN.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.122
   I'M GOING TO TELL EVERYONE
       WHAT IS GOING ON.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.258
        PLEASE SIT DOWN.
            - FINE.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.559
  - ALL RIGHT, STAY STANDING.
          THAT'S FINE.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.328
     OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.497
        I AM NOT IN LOVE
          WITH FIONA,

15:32.499 --> 15:34.365
       NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.368
       I ONLY SAID THAT,
    SO T.J. WOULD BACK OFF.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.137
            - WHAT?
              WHY?

15:39.139 --> 15:42.707
  - BECAUSE HE HATES THE IDEA
OF ME DATING ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.375
       - THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.545
     IT'S BECAUSE HE'S NOT
  GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, FIONA.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.180
         - DUDE, HARSH.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.715
    - YOU ARE A COMPETITION.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.383
         AS T.J. SAID,

15:52.385 --> 15:54.986
       WHOEVER BAGS FIONA
         GETS THE BELT.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.187
           - [gasps]

15:56.189 --> 15:57.555
          OH, MY GOD.
         - DISGUSTING.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.157
 - DUDE, NOW NEITHER ONE OF US

15:59.159 --> 16:02.660
     - DUDE, I NEVER WANTED
     TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.730
      I WANTED TO HAVE SEX
           WITH HER.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.731
          [screeches]

16:06.733 --> 16:09.067
      NOT--NOT FOR A BELT.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.969
    NOT--NOT AS A CONQUEST.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.071
            I-I-I--

16:13.073 --> 16:16.407
            I JUST--
    I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.276
            [sighs]

16:18.278 --> 16:20.745
     AND I'M SORRY, FIONA.
          I REALLY AM.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.282
   I DIDN'T--YOU'RE TOO COOL
       TO BE THE CONQUEST

16:24.284 --> 16:27.352
      OF SOME DOUCHE BAG.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.319
         - DOUCHE BAG!
            COME ON.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.555
           - OH, T.J.
           - [grunts]

16:30.557 --> 16:32.623
            COME ON.
      - NOT ON GAME NIGHT!

16:32.625 --> 16:34.192
            - ANDY!
      - NOT ON GAME NIGHT!

16:34.194 --> 16:35.526
          - NO BITING!
              OW!

16:38.130 --> 16:38.363
               .

16:38.365 --> 16:43.401
- LAURIE, DID YOU SEE SAM'S FACE
         WHEN SHE LEFT?

16:43.403 --> 16:46.704
     - GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
    YOU GAME NIGHT ASSASSIN.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.340
         - OKAY, OKAY.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.641
      LISTEN, BUDDY, MAN,

16:50.643 --> 16:53.378
I'M SORRY I RUINED YOUR CHANCES
       OF GETTING LUCKY.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.347
    - OH, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.650
          HEY, HONEY.
       - FORGET IT, ANDY.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.021
         [door closes]

17:04.589 --> 17:06.257
          [both gasp]

17:06.259 --> 17:07.358
      - SO DID YOU DO IT?

17:07.359 --> 17:08.393
      - WE TOTALLY KISSED.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.228
         RIGHT, MARCUS?
            - YEAH.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.530
   OUR LIPS PRESSED TOGETHER
        AND EVERYTHING.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.032
       - YOU DIDN'T KISS.
     - YEAH, YOU'RE LIARS.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.367
           - ARE NOT.
           WE KISSED.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.301
  - YEAH, WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND
       OF MICROORGANISMS

17:18.304 --> 17:19.303
       WERE TRANSFERRED?

17:19.305 --> 17:20.538
            - FINE.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.807
         IF YOU KISSED,
THEN IT'D BE TOTALLY NO BIG DEAL

17:22.809 --> 17:23.808
      IF YOU KISSED AGAIN.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.176
            - FINE.
             - HUH?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.345
   - WE'LL JUST DO IT AGAIN,

17:27.347 --> 17:28.813
   JUST LIKE WE DID IN THERE
         A MINUTE AGO.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.349
     - OH, I DON'T THINK--
           I THINK--

17:34.186 --> 17:35.820
             - EW!
         - THEY DID IT!

17:35.822 --> 17:37.288
             - EW!
         - OH, MY GOSH.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.525
     - EW, EW, EW, EW, EW.
      - WOW, THAT WAS--EW.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.793
        - MY FIRST KISS.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.328
        - MY THIRD KISS.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.166
           - [sighs]

17:48.168 --> 17:50.201
        HOW'D THINGS GO
        WITH YOUR LADY?

17:50.203 --> 17:52.203
      - NOT--NOT SO WELL.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.807
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.476
     - SO HOW OLD WERE YOU
 WHEN YOU GOT YOUR FIRST KISS?

17:58.478 --> 18:01.679
          - 14 OR 15.

18:01.681 --> 18:05.316
  DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BUDDY.
   IT'LL HAPPEN SOON ENOUGH.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.685
             - 11.
            - WHAT?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.354
      - OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
   DETAILS AREN'T IMPORTANT.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.424
       BUT LET'S JUST SAY
         I'M A MAN NOW.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.659
        [knock at door]

18:14.661 --> 18:16.527
       OH, THAT'S MY MOM.
       DON'T RAT ME OUT.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.664
        - JUST A MINUTE.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.332
           OH, YEAH.
      JUST COME RIGHT IN.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.533
       - OH, NO, I WILL.
         - NO PROBLEM.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.603
 - UM, A LOT HAPPENED TONIGHT,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.106
           SO I THINK
   WE SHOULD HAVE SOME WORDS.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.273
            - YEAH.
      NO, YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.709
             - FOR?
  - FOR DEFENDING YOUR HONOR.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.478
            - WHAT?
              NO.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.181
  NO, THOSE WERE NOT THE WORDS
    THAT I WAS THINKING OF.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.883
  YOU PRETENDED TO BE IN LOVE
            WITH ME.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.384
            [laughs]

18:40.386 --> 18:44.222
    - AGAIN, YOU'RE WELCOME.
            - OKAY.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.358
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF MYSELF
    FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW

18:47.360 --> 18:49.760
 WITH ONLY A FEW MINOR HICCUPS
         ALONG THE WAY,

18:49.762 --> 18:51.762
  BEEN DOING A FAIRLY GOOD JOB
             OF IT.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.867
          SO NEXT TIME
  SOMEONE WANTS TO TAKE ME OUT

18:55.869 --> 18:59.570
      AND HAVE SEX WITH ME
         TO WIN A BELT,

18:59.572 --> 19:00.905
         JUST TELL ME.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.707
          - YEAH, NO.
          I HEAR THAT.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.642
          I GOT THAT.
            - OKAY.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.912
       WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
      - GOOD NIGHT, FIONA.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.814
            - UH...

19:10.849 --> 19:15.653
          IN YOUR OWN
      VERY MISGUIDED WAY,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.822
 YOU DID DO AN HONORABLE THING
         TONIGHT, WILL,

19:17.824 --> 19:20.291
         AND THANK YOU.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.593
          DID YOU JUST
    LOOK AT MY BOOBS AGAIN?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.395
        - NO, I DID NOT.
        - YES, YOU DID.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.763
      - GET OVER YOURSELF.
        GET OUT OF HERE.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.465
          - GOOD GOD.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.700
        ONE-TRACK MIND.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.773
           [pounding]

19:35.775 --> 19:37.808
         - OKAY, FIONA.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.378
      I DID TAKE A GLANCE
      AT THE BOOBS AGAIN.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.713
      THEY'RE SOLID, OKAY?

19:42.715 --> 19:46.784
   - WELL, THAT JUST DERAILED
THE ENTIRE SPEECH I HAD PLANNED.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.853
        - I-I CAN'T--I--

19:48.855 --> 19:50.388
          I DON'T KNOW
     WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.925
         I CAN'T EVEN--
  I--WILL YOU PLEASE COME IN?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.394
    - WELL, AS I DROVE AWAY

19:56.396 --> 19:58.729
 FROM THE WEIRDEST TEN MINUTES
OF A PARTY I'VE EVER BEEN TO...

19:58.731 --> 19:59.764
            - YEAH.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.899
  - TWO THINGS STUCK WITH ME.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.537
ONE, THAT WAS A VERY COOL THING
    YOU DID FOR YOUR FRIEND.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.641
  TWO, THAT YOU HAVE FEELINGS
            FOR ME.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.745
       - HOW DO YOU FEEL
          ABOUT THAT?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.748
    - WELL, YOU KIND OF MADE
        A GRAND GESTURE,

20:17.750 --> 20:22.687
 SO I FELT LIKE I HAD TO RETURN
       THE GRAND GESTURE.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.389
     AND LAURIE SAID TO GET
    THIS CHEAP PIECE OF CRAP

20:25.391 --> 20:26.457
       OUT OF HER HOUSE,

20:26.459 --> 20:29.961
          SO I THOUGHT
      I'D BRING IT TO YOU.

20:29.963 --> 20:34.265
       THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU WERE THE BETTER MAN TONIGHT.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.833
       I HAVE TO GET BACK
            TO WORK.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.702
             BUT--
            - OKAY.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.845
   HEY, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL
     WITH THAT, ALL RIGHT?

20:47.847 --> 20:50.815
           - SHUT UP.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.457
   - YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.025
    - I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.293
       - THAT'S SO EVIL.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.995
           - [laughs]
