No? So, listen, your, uh,
your Uncle Gob...

10:45.432 --> 10:48.833
seems to think that he saw you
down at the docks today.

10:48.936 --> 10:51.370
- Was that you?
- No, no.

10:51.471 --> 10:55.100
Maybe it was the other George Michael...
the singer-songwriter.

10:55.209 --> 10:57.109
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

10:57.211 --> 11:00.146
What'd you do
with the, um...

11:00.247 --> 11:02.772
with the money Buster and I gave you
to go have fun with?

11:02.883 --> 11:05.443
I put that
in my savings account.

11:05.552 --> 11:08.043
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Save up.

11:08.155 --> 11:12.717
- Okay. Thanks for being honest.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:12.826 --> 11:14.987

Can you believe that?

is this family's morality?

11:18.832 --> 11:20.732

- What...
- It's cold out here. { Coughs]

11:23.837 --> 11:26.203
What do I do now? If I confront him,
he's gonna lie to me again.

11:26.306 --> 11:30.936
- Should I yell at him?
- Didn't Dad teach us that
we don't yell in this family?

You wanna teach
George Michael a lesson?

12:07.147 --> 12:10.878
Yes, I do, and it's gotta stick. He's getting
into drugs, Dad, and he's lying to me.

12:10.984 --> 12:13.009
That doesn't sound
like the boy.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.020
It's my fault.
I've been pushing him too hard.

12:15.122 --> 12:17.022
- It's just... Dumb, dumb. Dumb, Michael.
- Hey, hey.

12:17.124 --> 12:18.819
- Dumb.
- Shh, shh, shh. I forgive you.

12:18.925 --> 12:22.452
I don't want your forgiveness. I want the guy
with the one arm and the fake blood.

12:22.562 --> 12:25.292
- J. Walter Weatherman...
how do I get ahold of him?
- He's, uh, dead.

12:25.399 --> 12:28.493
You killed him when you left the door open
with the air conditioner running.

12:28.602 --> 12:32.299
For God's sake. He's not dead.
I need to do this soon, tonight.

12:32.406 --> 12:35.170

like a drug deal went bad.

Tonight? No. It's Yontif.
It's the first night of Yom Kippur.

12:39.913 --> 12:42.404
Dad, that's just... That's one night,
and it's back in September.

12:42.516 --> 12:44.416
That's okay.
You've only been a Jew about two days.

12:44.518 --> 12:47.976
- Just try to talk to him.
- Like you talked to me when I was growing up?

12:48.088 --> 12:51.216
- I thought you hated those lessons.
- I did, but they worked.

12:51.325 --> 12:55.261
- And they will work again.
- Well, I'm done with them,
because it was wrong, Michael.

12:55.362 --> 12:57.887
- Come on.
- Your son is a timid, thoughtful boy.

They've never done
any <i>hot</i> policing.

14:36.897 --> 14:40.060
They don't even need to be hot. They just
need to show up in those uniforms.

They're not going to strip,

I told them not to, but I can't promise
that their instincts won't kick in.

- Trust me. It's gonna be totally real.
