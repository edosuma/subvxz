WEBVTT

00:02.333 --> 00:03.382
Boring.

00:05.336 --> 00:07.169
We've been following the
map to the Cosmic Seed

00:07.170 --> 00:10.088
for three days now.

00:10.089 --> 00:12.224
Let's play a car game. We
used to play them all the time

00:12.225 --> 00:13.392
on long road trips when I was a kid.

00:16.514 --> 00:17.479
Slug star!

00:18.482 --> 00:21.066
I am Groot!

00:21.067 --> 00:22.217
Sit on your hands, Quill,

00:22.218 --> 00:24.353
before I remove them from your wrists.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.442
Oh, relax, Gamora. It's a game.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.360
Only you punch someone
when you see a star

00:32.362 --> 00:33.428
instead of a car.

00:33.429 --> 00:35.364
It's not my fault Groot's a klutz.

00:35.365 --> 00:37.533
Hey, lay off the hurt speech, Quill.

00:37.534 --> 00:40.302
Don't you know Groot
was an awkward sapling?

00:40.303 --> 00:43.472
I mean, he grew out of it,
but it's still a sore point.

00:43.473 --> 00:45.374
Where is this sore point, Rocket?

00:45.375 --> 00:47.209
In my days as an arena fighter,

00:47.210 --> 00:48.410
I would soothe my aching muscles

00:48.411 --> 00:50.412
with an extract of slug-roach pancreas.

00:54.351 --> 00:57.219
You gonna act like a child,
or you gonna navigate?

00:57.220 --> 00:59.471
Why can't I do both?

00:59.472 --> 01:01.390
Oh, wait. We're here.

01:01.391 --> 01:04.226
Uh, you sure about that, genius?

01:04.227 --> 01:06.428
Yeah, that's weird.

01:06.429 --> 01:09.448
There's this dead moon
called "Mandala" on the map.

01:09.449 --> 01:11.116
It's not here in person.

01:11.117 --> 01:13.118
Is this another car game?

01:13.119 --> 01:16.238
No. See, look. The Cosmic Seed was here.

01:16.239 --> 01:18.240
There's an energy trail leading away.

01:18.241 --> 01:19.408
Give me a slow right turn.

01:23.514 --> 01:25.130
Now back a smidge.

01:27.084 --> 01:28.116
And...

01:28.117 --> 01:29.084
Hey!

01:30.337 --> 01:33.288
Nebula! Where did she come from?

01:33.289 --> 01:35.224
I'm gonna guess
from that big ship

01:35.225 --> 01:37.142
that just de-cloaked behind her.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.743
I thought I had destroyed Nebula's ship

02:00.744 --> 02:02.111
with Ronan's universal weapon.

02:02.112 --> 02:04.830
Looks like my sister is
trying to return the favor.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.754
Hey, here's an idea.

02:11.755 --> 02:13.088
What say we steer the ship away

02:13.089 --> 02:15.691
from the crazy lady with
the universal whatever?

02:15.692 --> 02:16.875
Now, where's the fun in that?

02:19.797 --> 02:20.796
Hang on.

02:25.136 --> 02:27.136
Quill, you're playing with fire.

02:30.975 --> 02:32.858
No, Quill is playing with your sister,

02:32.859 --> 02:34.059
and she is not on fire...

02:34.979 --> 02:35.945
That we know of.

02:41.736 --> 02:43.068
Check it out. Slingshot!

02:49.827 --> 02:51.160
I swear,

02:51.161 --> 02:52.995
I won't ever get these car games.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.071
We have to find her and finish her.

03:02.072 --> 03:04.974
This is about getting
to the Cosmic Seed first.

03:04.975 --> 03:07.726
That's why I hurled her
away from the energy trail.

03:11.182 --> 03:14.783
<i>♪ Found a peanutFound
a peanutFound a pea... ♪</i>

03:14.784 --> 03:16.685
Hey! There's our missing dead moon.

03:16.686 --> 03:19.071
Atmosphere, water, and vegetation.

03:19.072 --> 03:21.857
Huh, you got a real funny
definition of "dead", Quill.

03:21.858 --> 03:23.859
We've seen what the Cosmic Seed can do.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.911
If it accelerates life,

03:25.912 --> 03:27.746
maybe it can tear a moon from its orbit.

03:27.747 --> 03:29.748
And maybe, just maybe,

03:29.749 --> 03:31.917
the Cosmic Seed is really down there.

03:41.044 --> 03:44.046
What will it take for him to
cease this infernal racket?

03:44.047 --> 03:47.716
When I served Thanos, I would've
eviscerated a man for less.

03:50.888 --> 03:51.987
Looks good.

03:51.988 --> 03:53.856
The energy's really strong on... Hey.

03:53.857 --> 03:55.724
First day
with your new roots?

03:55.725 --> 03:57.793
Take care, Groot.
You must not re-injure

03:57.794 --> 03:59.695
the sore spot from
your awkward childhood.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.666
Were those trees here before?

04:06.904 --> 04:08.804
I am Groo... Whoa!

04:08.805 --> 04:09.905
Hey...

04:13.076 --> 04:15.944
Okay, I know that was
not there a second ago.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.132
Annoying rodent.

04:21.134 --> 04:23.085
I will roast you over a flame

04:23.086 --> 04:24.920
and feast upon your carcass

04:24.921 --> 04:27.973
to celebrate my victory
in the arena this day.

04:27.974 --> 04:30.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. First
rule of the Guardians.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.844
Friends don't eat friends.

04:31.845 --> 04:33.896
Whoa.

04:35.165 --> 04:37.833
I have no friends.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.935
What? That's not true.
We're a team, here.

04:39.936 --> 04:41.703
I serve only Ronan.

04:42.106 --> 04:44.006
And my father, Thanos.

04:44.007 --> 04:45.140
Wait...

04:45.141 --> 04:47.776
That's the old you.

04:47.777 --> 04:50.779
At last, a worthy opponent.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.115
We will give this crowd a show.

04:53.116 --> 04:55.017
And
that's the old you, too.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.954
Groo-oo-oot!

04:58.955 --> 05:00.089
Why is everybody going retro?

05:02.676 --> 05:05.694
You are unskilled. You will
not last long in the arena.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.099
Yes.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.800
Don't trifle with me.

05:11.801 --> 05:14.703
I'm an agent of Ronan the Accuser.

05:14.704 --> 05:18.073
What sort of
feeble title is "Accuser"?

05:18.074 --> 05:21.777
Surely, this Ronan is no
threat to Drax the Destroyer.

05:21.778 --> 05:23.061
I am Groot!

05:23.062 --> 05:24.847
Yeah!

05:24.848 --> 05:26.949
Um, Drax, he's a serious
threat to your family.

05:26.950 --> 05:28.117
At least he was before we turned him

05:28.118 --> 05:30.919
into a little grease stain on Xandar.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.123
You dare claim to have
destroyed Ronan the Accuser?

05:34.124 --> 05:37.126
You dare threaten my family?

05:37.127 --> 05:39.128
You will perish
for your insolence!

05:46.836 --> 05:48.053
Oh, hey, Rocket.

05:48.054 --> 05:49.738
Thanks for grabbing that for me.

05:54.078 --> 05:55.978
I am
Groo-oo-oot!

06:02.853 --> 06:05.654
Guys. Guys. Look, if I have
to be the voice of reason,

06:05.655 --> 06:07.072
this is not gonna end well.

06:08.476 --> 06:11.227
I'll bring your head to Ronan, Ravager.

06:12.308 --> 06:15.809
I'm not a Ravager. Not anymore.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.928
Then why do you dress as a Ravager?

06:17.929 --> 06:20.847
It's a long story, okay?
I was raised by Ravagers,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.933
but now I'm a hero
trying to save the galaxy,

06:22.934 --> 06:24.117
just like you guys.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.820
I only save the galaxy for Ronan.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.089
By cleansing it of filth like you.

06:31.994 --> 06:33.160
I am Groot.

06:34.330 --> 06:35.929
Guys, focus.

06:35.930 --> 06:37.964
You're not yourselves.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.100
Lies. I am Drax the destroyer.

06:40.101 --> 06:41.251
Who else would I be?

06:41.252 --> 06:44.838
Something's making you all
act like your old selves.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.177
What is wrong with you people?

06:50.178 --> 06:52.012
And how come I'm falling?

06:55.150 --> 06:56.883
What kind of cockamamie rock did

06:56.884 --> 06:58.885
you land us on, Qui...

07:00.973 --> 07:04.958
I get it. Contact with the
surface is making you regress.

07:04.959 --> 07:07.894
Tell it to Ronan, Ravager.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.963
Fine, if I can't keep
you off the surface,

07:09.964 --> 07:11.782
I'll just make my own.

07:20.242 --> 07:21.241
Whoa.

07:21.242 --> 07:24.044
I am Groot.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.249
What is your krutakin' issue, Quill?

07:29.250 --> 07:31.184
And why do I feel like
rooting through garbage?

07:31.185 --> 07:33.920
I just met earlier versions of you.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.922
An arena fighter, Ronan's enforcer,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.158
a klutz and a rabies risk.

07:38.159 --> 07:40.827
Looks like this moon just
sucks the maturity out of you.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.162
So how come you weren't affected?

07:42.163 --> 07:44.898
Because Quill has no
maturity to begin with.

07:44.899 --> 07:48.135
Or the Cosmic Seed energy
of my boom box protected me.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.003
It's probably one of
those two.

07:56.044 --> 07:57.878
Groot, is there any way you can dig down

07:57.879 --> 08:00.113
and seal up that geyser
before it melts all the ice?

08:09.091 --> 08:11.124
I am Groot.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.193
What do you mean, "The moon is alive"?

08:13.194 --> 08:17.197
<i>Again.
Again.</i>

08:17.198 --> 08:19.800
I'm guessing he means that.

08:21.220 --> 08:25.038
<i>No freeze.
Mandala want to play!</i>

08:25.039 --> 08:27.190
Doesn't sound like this
moon's been alive too long.

08:27.191 --> 08:30.143
More like a lonely, bored, very big kid.

08:30.144 --> 08:33.280
Hmm. Now, who's that remind me of?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.981
I wonder.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.951
Quill. This moon reminds you of Quill.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.886
Because it is extremely
immature, and so is Quill.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.056
Well, nice meeting you, kid.

08:43.057 --> 08:46.226
Planet? Whatever. But we gotta
grab a little Cosmic Seed and run.

08:57.172 --> 08:59.272
Okay, guys. You know what's coming next.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.007
Don't go back to your old selves.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.175
Resist the regression.

09:02.176 --> 09:03.760
Keep away from me.

09:03.761 --> 09:04.978
I don't wanna hurt any of you.

09:06.815 --> 09:09.816
I want to annihilate you all!

09:10.852 --> 09:12.252
<i>Yeah! Fight!</i>

09:14.189 --> 09:16.022
Mandala, why are you doing this?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.859
<i>Because it's fun.</i>

09:18.860 --> 09:21.795
<i>Mandala make you young
so we can play.</i>

09:28.003 --> 09:30.070
Ronan the Accuser's flagship.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.805
It's Nebula's ship now.

09:31.806 --> 09:33.273
And she's after the Cosmic Seed.

09:33.274 --> 09:34.841
I don't know what that is,

09:34.842 --> 09:36.009
but I will not allow my sister

09:36.010 --> 09:38.178
to claim it for Ronan before I do.

09:38.179 --> 09:41.047
Clearly, it is the prize
for which we will fight.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.917
<i>Yes!
Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

09:43.918 --> 09:45.085
Guys, focus.

09:45.086 --> 09:47.187
We need to get the
Cosmic Seed before Nebula.

09:47.188 --> 09:49.823
And they call me immature.

09:50.325 --> 09:52.225
Wait. That's it.

09:52.226 --> 09:55.061
Hey, losers. Wanna fight?

09:56.831 --> 09:58.865
Come and get me.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.967
That's right. Follow the leader...

10:00.968 --> 10:02.168
Right to the Cosmic Seed.

10:04.956 --> 10:08.959
<i>Friend! You came
backlike you promised!</i>

10:08.960 --> 10:11.962
<i>Now you can play
with my new friends.</i>

10:11.963 --> 10:13.914
Guardians are no friends.

10:16.018 --> 10:18.218
I return because this primordial armpit

10:18.219 --> 10:20.320
is soaked with life-giving energy

10:20.321 --> 10:23.857
that nourishes the seed
I planted here earlier.

10:28.012 --> 10:30.897
<i>Why you hit Mandala?</i>

10:30.898 --> 10:34.935
<i>Mandala makeyour friend
better, like Mandala promised.</i>

10:43.861 --> 10:47.113
Ronan the Accuser lives once more.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.949
What is this place?

10:48.950 --> 10:52.118
Who dares disturb
Ronan? Explain yourself.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.170
Lord Ronan, I recovered your helmet

10:54.171 --> 10:56.923
after your untimely... Departure.

10:56.924 --> 11:00.961
Once I discovered this moon's
unusual life-generating properties,

11:00.962 --> 11:03.063
I used it to resurrect you.

11:04.066 --> 11:06.099
It's Nebula, Lord.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.102
Perhaps your universal
weapon will jog your memory.

11:09.103 --> 11:12.238
We will overthrow Thanos
and rule the galaxy together.

11:18.313 --> 11:21.014
Ronan shares power with no one.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.987
<i>♪ Run, run, run,

11:36.998 --> 11:38.164

11:39.935 --> 11:41.034
I'm rubber, you're glue.

11:41.035 --> 11:43.136
Everything bounces off
of me and sticks to you!

11:46.975 --> 11:49.876
You are mistaken. It does not stick.

11:57.019 --> 11:58.284
Are you kidding me?

11:58.285 --> 12:01.221
Ronan? Told you it was his ship.

12:01.222 --> 12:03.156
But didn't we watch him, like,

12:03.157 --> 12:04.941
blow up in a billion pieces?

12:04.942 --> 12:07.911
Gamora. What is all this?

12:07.912 --> 12:10.864
Oh, so he remembers you.

12:10.865 --> 12:13.133
Do you remember her betrayal?

12:13.134 --> 12:16.252
You only betray your own
petty jealousy, sister.

12:16.253 --> 12:19.005
I bring you this insolent Ravager

12:19.006 --> 12:22.008
who claims to have
destroyed you, Lord Ronan.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.127
Technically, we all destroyed you.

12:24.128 --> 12:25.912
But looks like you got better.

12:26.348 --> 12:28.314
<i>Yay!</i>

12:28.315 --> 12:31.184
<i>All Mandala's friends here.</i>

12:31.185 --> 12:33.153
<i>Now we can all play.</i>

12:33.154 --> 12:36.139
A Kree accuser does not play.

12:38.310 --> 12:41.895
<i>Hey, quit it.</i>

12:41.896 --> 12:44.864
Oh, come on. You made a moon cry.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.200
Do I have to challenge
you to another dance-off?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.170
Silence, Ravager.

12:50.171 --> 12:52.939
Guardian of the Galaxy, dude.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.207
You gave us our name.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.943
I mean, it was sarcastic
when you said it. But still.

13:00.248 --> 13:02.799
Hey! Now you're making me mad.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.001
Get him, Drax.

13:05.002 --> 13:06.920
I have no quarrel with this man.

13:06.921 --> 13:09.255
But you will. You did.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.257
You... Just trust me on this one, okay?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.126
And since when do you need an excuse

13:13.127 --> 13:15.261
to beat the snot out of somebody?

13:15.262 --> 13:17.097
Forgive me for not having rid you

13:17.098 --> 13:19.999
of these lice sooner, Lord Ronan.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.102
This mission has been odd,

13:22.103 --> 13:25.238
but I will destroy them for you now.

13:25.239 --> 13:28.108
She's weak. Let me prove myself.

13:30.946 --> 13:33.246
I shall fight you both.

13:34.249 --> 13:36.282
What glorious sport for my fans.

13:41.123 --> 13:43.156
Hey, remember back when we were
all fighting the regression?

13:43.157 --> 13:44.858
Those were good times, huh?

13:44.859 --> 13:47.043
Now let's get it together
and stop the bad guy!

13:50.265 --> 13:53.183
You fools are not worthy of my time.

13:53.184 --> 13:56.302
I live again to exact
revenge on my enemies.

13:57.339 --> 13:59.072
Take my advice, stranger.

13:59.073 --> 14:01.141
Revenge is a waste of time.

14:10.952 --> 14:14.070
<i>What you do to Mandala?</i>

14:14.071 --> 14:16.039
Silence.

14:16.040 --> 14:21.161
Any creature that lives can
be bent to the will of Ronan.

14:38.263 --> 14:39.262
I am Groot!

14:50.992 --> 14:53.226
Gamora, wait. Remember who you are.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.261
You're a Guardian. You're one of us.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.898
I would never
join the likes of you.

15:02.287 --> 15:03.953
Think again, sister.

15:16.179 --> 15:18.129
Are you deranged, Ravager?

15:18.130 --> 15:20.214
Why would anyone save my life?

15:20.215 --> 15:22.216
Because that's what friends do.

15:24.287 --> 15:27.055
I told you. I have no friends.

15:27.056 --> 15:30.141
There are no friends in the
combat arena. Only opponents.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.125
I am Groot!

15:40.936 --> 15:42.120
Guys, the walls.

15:42.121 --> 15:45.039
Guys... Hey, listen up!

15:45.040 --> 15:46.074
Just 'cause you're immature,

15:46.075 --> 15:47.875
doesn't mean you have to be stupid.

15:47.876 --> 15:49.043
We've got a choice.

15:49.044 --> 15:51.913
We can work together or
get buried alive together.

15:51.914 --> 15:54.115
Now, what's it gonna be?

15:54.116 --> 15:57.919
This moon will provide
me the power I need

15:57.920 --> 16:00.822
to obliterate the ancient
enemies of the Kree.

16:02.842 --> 16:06.227
Mandala, show me the way to Xandar,

16:06.228 --> 16:09.931
and I will allow you to serve me.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.033
I am Groot.

16:13.269 --> 16:15.069
Maybe you were clumsy once, Groot,

16:15.070 --> 16:17.105
but you grew out of it. Trust me.

16:19.843 --> 16:22.076
I'll trust you for
now, Guardian-not-a-Ravager.

16:22.077 --> 16:24.912
But if we survive, I'll
still finish you all.

16:24.913 --> 16:28.916
And, believe it or not,
you grew out of that, too.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.119
Is Mandala... Moving?

16:31.120 --> 16:34.922
<i>Mandala
not want to move.</i>

16:34.923 --> 16:36.174
<i>He make me.</i>

16:36.175 --> 16:39.060
<i>Take me to place
called Xandar.</i>

16:39.061 --> 16:41.879
<i>But this game not fun.</i>

16:41.880 --> 16:43.264
You know what else isn't fun?

16:43.265 --> 16:48.019
The whole "Mandala make you
young so we can play" game.

16:48.020 --> 16:51.139
We can help, but you have
to let my team grow up.

16:51.140 --> 16:55.109
<i>Mmm. Well, Mandala try.</i>

16:56.146 --> 16:57.979
Planet Xandar.

16:57.980 --> 17:00.948
You've seen your last sunrise.

17:00.949 --> 17:05.185
Odd. The moon isn't
putting up any resistance.

17:05.186 --> 17:07.789
That you know about.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.157
Ronan. You live?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.226
Now he remembers.

17:22.137 --> 17:24.806
Groot, you connected
with this rock before.

17:24.807 --> 17:27.008
See if you can break Ronan's
connection to Mandala.

17:27.009 --> 17:29.260
I am Groot!

17:29.261 --> 17:34.098
<i>Mandala not play
with bad Ronan man.</i>

17:35.902 --> 17:38.903
<i>Mandala sorry, friends.</i>

17:38.904 --> 17:41.823
Stay with it. I got your back.

17:49.032 --> 17:50.948
Why are the Guardians alive?

17:59.292 --> 18:01.776
You said you'd destroy them.

18:01.777 --> 18:03.794
I grew up.

18:03.795 --> 18:06.214
<i>Help Mandala,
friend Groot,</i>

18:06.215 --> 18:09.183
<i>make bad Ronan man go away.</i>

18:10.219 --> 18:14.222
<i>Yes. Mandala feel stronger.</i>

18:14.223 --> 18:16.891
No!

18:16.892 --> 18:19.026
<i>No!</i>

18:19.027 --> 18:23.114
<i>Please not make
Mandala hurt friends.</i>

18:23.115 --> 18:25.199
Come on, Groot.
Give it one more try.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.034
Dig those roots deep.

18:27.035 --> 18:28.986
I... Am...

18:28.987 --> 18:31.072
Groot!

18:31.073 --> 18:35.109
<i>And I am Mandala!</i>

18:35.110 --> 18:37.161
You did it, buddy.

18:37.162 --> 18:39.146
You helped Mandala steer us away!

18:42.986 --> 18:44.986
I am Groot.

18:44.987 --> 18:47.088
A futile effort.

18:47.089 --> 18:53.094
No mere planet can overpower
my universal weapon.

18:53.095 --> 18:55.263
Let this moon serve

18:55.264 --> 18:58.015
as an instrument of justice.

18:58.016 --> 19:04.155
To deliver the punishment
decreed by Ronan the Accuser!

19:04.156 --> 19:07.992
Mandala, come on. You don't need
Groot to fight Ronan for you.

19:07.993 --> 19:10.244
You have to fight, or
it's "Bye bye, Xandar."

19:10.245 --> 19:14.248
<i>Mandala
not like this game.</i>

19:14.249 --> 19:15.950
Yeah, well, we all
gotta grow up sometime,

19:15.951 --> 19:17.952
or playtime's over, forever.

19:19.122 --> 19:20.871
Nice pep talk, Quill.

19:20.872 --> 19:22.957
Way to scare the big-boy
pants right off him.

19:24.961 --> 19:26.093
Xandar.

19:26.094 --> 19:30.798
You have been found guilty
by Ronan the Accuser.

19:30.799 --> 19:33.851
Prepare to be cleansed.

19:44.063 --> 19:45.813
<i>Leave...</i>

19:45.814 --> 19:47.031
<i>Mandala...</i>

19:47.032 --> 19:49.066
<i>Alone!</i>

20:02.882 --> 20:05.833
<i>Mandala
feel much better now.</i>

20:05.834 --> 20:07.835
<i>Thanks to friends.</i>

20:07.836 --> 20:09.904
I wish I could say the same.

20:09.905 --> 20:11.272
Ronan lives,

20:11.273 --> 20:15.009
which means he has escaped
justice for destroying my family.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.260
On the bright side, it means

20:16.261 --> 20:18.229
you get to destroy him all over again.

20:18.230 --> 20:23.067
And it looks like the Cosmic
Seed is someplace else... Again.

20:23.068 --> 20:24.185
But it was here,

20:24.186 --> 20:26.937
and its energy must have
brought Mandala to life.

20:26.938 --> 20:28.856
Either way, we're back on the road.

20:28.857 --> 20:32.159
Oh, joy. More car games?

20:32.160 --> 20:35.062
<i>Wait.
Friends not staying?</i>

20:35.063 --> 20:37.999
Yeah, sorry we can't stick
around and play, Mandala,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.001
but we sort of got a galaxy to protect.

20:40.002 --> 20:42.953
<i>Mandala not
wantto play anymore.</i>

20:42.954 --> 20:45.106
<i>Mandala want to protect.</i>

20:45.107 --> 20:47.308
<i>Like Guardian friends.</i>

20:47.309 --> 20:49.243
You know, we could always use

20:49.244 --> 20:51.946
a big, strong planetoid in our ranks.

20:51.947 --> 20:54.056
How'd you like to be
an honorary Guardian?

20:54.057 --> 20:56.258
As long as you're protecting,
you'll never be alone.

20:57.387 --> 21:00.805
<i>Mandala like.</i>

21:02.891 --> 21:04.275
If an infant
planetoid can grow up,

21:04.276 --> 21:06.227
there may be hope for Quill.

21:06.228 --> 21:08.029
You sure about that, Gammy?

21:17.239 --> 21:18.956
Ridiculous.

21:18.957 --> 21:20.975
Sling shot!

21:20.976 --> 21:23.127
But... It does look kinda fun.

21:25.048 --> 21:25.988
I call next.
- Me! Me!

21:25.989 --> 21:27.300
Slug star!

21:27.301 --> 21:31.088
I'll never get these car games.
