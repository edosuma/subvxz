of weapon.

invent so-called superweapons,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.949

or a death ray.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.993

could deter war.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.724
A Tesla coil is
an electrical resonant

10:41.807 --> 10:43.225
transformer circuit.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.227
We're gonna make stuff go boom.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.227
Ooh.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.730
You take those
and lay them out right there.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.571
By laying out lengths of magnet,

10:55.654 --> 10:58.115
a Tesla coil can take
low voltage electricity

10:58.199 --> 10:59.742
and turn it into high voltage.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.578
In other words, we're gonna
turn it up to 11.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.247
There in here.
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.250
(electricity hissing,
grunting)

11:11.295 --> 11:13.881
(blows landing)

11:13.964 --> 11:15.299
(grunting)

11:34.527 --> 11:38.572
(high-pitched tone sounding)

11:43.035 --> 11:45.413
(high-pitched tone continues)

11:51.877 --> 11:53.379
Hey, how, uh...?

11:53.671 --> 11:54.964
How long was I out?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.341
Just a couple of hours.
Hey, I think

11:57.425 --> 12:00.302
you should
stay still, okay?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.637
(MacGyver sighs)

12:01.721 --> 12:03.013
What happened?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.807
What's the last thing
you remember?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.145
Oh, we were at Tesla's house.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.022
And then we found
all that cool stuff

12:12.106 --> 12:13.607
in the...

12:13.691 --> 12:16.110
room? And then...

12:16.193 --> 12:18.195
fire?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.158
Okay, you know what?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.492
He's concussed.
We all just need

12:23.576 --> 12:24.994
to take a step back
for a second.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.994
Wait.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.497
Shiva? Why-why am I thinking
about a Hindu deity?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.541
Mac, I think
you should just rest, okay?

12:30.624 --> 12:33.002
No. No, there's no time.
We need what's in his head.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.546
Codex has the map.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.673
Oh.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.219
They ambushed us.
I remember that, but why?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.220
BOZER:
We think they used us.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.014
They knew about
Oversight's code

12:45.097 --> 12:47.141
and wanted us to break it so
we'd lead them to Tesla's map.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.517
TAYLOR:
After you went down,
it turned into a bit

12:48.601 --> 12:49.768
of a shoot-out, but, um,

12:49.852 --> 12:53.147
ultimately, they overpowered us
and took what they came for.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.357
The map.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.819
Which leads to Tesla's
superweapon.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.029
So Tesla must have
hidden the weapon

13:00.112 --> 13:02.031
so it wouldn't fall
into the wrong hands.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.033
And the map shows us where.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.868
MATTY: Sorry to state the
obvious here, but we need to get

13:05.951 --> 13:07.578
to said superweapon

13:07.661 --> 13:08.871
before the global
terrorist organization does.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.206
DESI:
And how?

13:10.289 --> 13:11.540
They have the map,
and we obviously don't.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.541
RILEY:
Hold on a second.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.542
Before the ambush, you said

13:13.626 --> 13:14.710
even if you had the map,

13:14.793 --> 13:16.086
you'd need the room
to decipher it.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.008
Yes.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.722
But I can't remember why.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.058
Do you remember anything
about it at all?

13:31.810 --> 13:33.062
TAYLOR:
Memory loss is unpredictable.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.606
It could come back
in days, years.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.733
Never.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.236
I have an idea. Bozer,

13:40.319 --> 13:41.737
I want you to
reach out to DARPA.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.448
Use my clearance and
ask for Dr. Cheryl Werner.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.701
In the meantime, look for
any info we can find on Shiva

13:47.785 --> 13:48.994
and where that map might lead.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.791
The Markridge Scientific
Institute in Pasadena.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.417
Tesla used to lecture there.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.585
They have an extensive archive

13:56.669 --> 13:57.753
<i>on all of his files.</i>

13:57.836 --> 14:00.089
<i>If you're gonna find anything,</i>
<i>that's where it will be.</i>

14:00.172 --> 14:04.927
Just once, I would like
to work with a mad scientist

14:05.010 --> 14:07.930
who files things
alphabetically.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.265
I'd kill right now
for a scanner

14:09.348 --> 14:11.850
and ten lines
of Python code.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.648
This section is off-limits
for students.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.816
(Taylor laughs)

14:18.899 --> 14:20.359
Well, you flatter.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.735
It's been many a decade since

14:21.819 --> 14:23.946
anyone called me
a student... Karen.

14:24.029 --> 14:24.989
May I just say, that is an

14:25.072 --> 14:26.448
exquisite flower
on your blouse.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.660
Russell Taylor,
history department.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.453
Never heard of you.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.455
And I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.499
That's because I've just
transferred in from Oxford.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.793
I'm looking for
a manuscript

14:37.876 --> 14:39.295
that may or may not
have been misplaced.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.132
It's entitled "The Theory of
Conflict Deterrence."

14:43.215 --> 14:46.135
I assure you, nothing in my
archives is "missed" anything.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.761
If it's here, I can find it.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.804
Well, then,
thank God for you, Karen.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.599
Hmm? Your skill will
save us all.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.517
I'll look on the computer.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.436
Marvelous.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.526
Oh...

15:02.610 --> 15:06.697
Mac is always doodling things
like this on cocktail napkins.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.657
He and Tesla probably have
a lot in common.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.326
I hope not.
According to this,

15:10.409 --> 15:13.704
Tesla died penniless
and alone.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.372
Maid found his body
in a hotel room,

15:15.456 --> 15:17.041
surrounded by dead pigeons.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.043
Ew.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.712
(sighs)

15:21.795 --> 15:23.380
I'm worried about Mac.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.091
First losing his dad.
That was bad enough.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.011
And then letting Lasky,
the nuclear plant engineer die.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
Yeah.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.847
It's taking a toll on him.

15:31.930 --> 15:35.017
And now he's up all night
making apocalypse bags.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.519
Who knows what else.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.481
I mean, I don't know
what to do. I--

15:40.564 --> 15:42.524
In my family, we don't even
talk about our feelings.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.026
We just make soup.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.527
Thank you, Karen.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.988
All right, I bought us
some time.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.448
But we are two phone calls away

15:49.531 --> 15:50.991
from being thrown out
of this place.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.035
So let us hurry.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.209
(Taylor muttering indistinctly)

16:02.961 --> 16:05.214
11/9/37.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.132
Russ... got something?

16:09.343 --> 16:10.928
11/9/37.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.431
There are 26 letters
alone in this box,

16:14.515 --> 16:17.226
handwritten, dated 11/9/37.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.897
If Tesla was building
the ultimate weapon,

16:21.980 --> 16:23.691
he'd most likely find a way
to encode his work.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.736
What if these numbers are
some sort of cryptokey?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.905
So we need everything
we can find

16:29.988 --> 16:32.074
dated November 9, 1937.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.074
Mmm.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.284
I mean, that must be the key
to where he hid Shiva.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.911
Right.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.082
So, you want to give me
a memory drug?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.084
It's an experimental
psychotropic drug

16:42.167 --> 16:43.419
developed by DARPA.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.921
It contains DMT,
which has been proven

16:46.004 --> 16:47.923
to help trauma patients
recover lost memories.

16:48.006 --> 16:48.757
We're hoping it'll help you find

16:48.841 --> 16:50.926
whatever you saw
in the Tesla house.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.095
And it's safe?

16:51.009 --> 16:53.095
(snickers)

16:53.178 --> 16:56.598
Cheryl, I swear to God!

16:53.178 --> 16:56.598
Sorry.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.226
It is so not safe.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.226
BOZER:
Matty, who is this?

16:59.309 --> 17:02.229
Doesn't Phoenix already have
a team of fancy doctors?

17:02.312 --> 17:03.939
Cheryl is an old friend of mine

17:04.022 --> 17:05.983
That's "Dr. Cheryl" to you.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.192
Okay.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.153
She works at DARPA.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.738
Yeah, the money's good,
and my student loan payoff date

17:10.821 --> 17:12.740
is 2064, so...
Quick question.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.366
Have you ever had
a psychotic break,

17:14.450 --> 17:16.452
and if so, do you anticipate
becoming violent?

17:16.535 --> 17:19.747
Uh, no. Why?

17:19.830 --> 17:23.083
Because patients have suffered
severe reactions to this drug.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.961
Mental breakdowns.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.755
Some... irreversible damage.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.757
Look, Mac...

17:29.840 --> 17:30.883
You don't have to do this.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.803
But it might be our only shot
at finding that weapon

17:34.887 --> 17:36.930
before Codex does,
so let's do it.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.974
Your prefrontal cortex,
or short-term memories,

17:39.057 --> 17:40.934
that's the part
we need to engage.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.479
We'll also give you a sedative,
which will keep you unconscious

17:43.562 --> 17:44.813
and put you in a REM stage.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.774
You'll be in
a lucid dream state

17:46.857 --> 17:47.983
reflecting your short-term
memories.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
Stay focused there.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.361
Do not go wandering around
into your past.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.992
Who knows, maybe this will help.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.202
CHERYL: Okay, you ready?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.202
BOZER: Hold on.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.496
Maybe we should have a safe word
or something, just in case.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.831
Tacos!

18:00.579 --> 18:02.831
MATTY: Okay,
that is not possible.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
Once he's under, the only thing
that can pull him out

18:04.917 --> 18:06.877
is the adrenaline
from the discovery

18:06.960 --> 18:10.005
of the short-term memory
that he's looking for.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.673
And what if I don't find it?

18:11.757 --> 18:13.801
If your vitals spike,
a medically induced

18:13.884 --> 18:15.427
adrenaline shot should
do the trick. Okay?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.722
Please close your eyes.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.392
And count backwards from ten.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.647
(exhales sharply)
Ten... nine...

18:28.190 --> 18:32.027
...eight... seven...

18:32.110 --> 18:33.862
Was there a sedative in there?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.323
I don't think it's working.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.408
(old-time jazz playing)

18:40.619 --> 18:42.704
(indistinct chatter)

18:42.788 --> 18:44.790
(scoffs)

18:46.625 --> 18:48.627
This is Tesla's house.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.089
Coppers crashed in
at midnight.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.758
All 'cause of some
damn whiskey?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.771
Angus, what are you
doing here?

19:07.855 --> 19:11.400
Um... well, it's my brain.
Do I know you?

19:11.483 --> 19:15.112
You should be hiding.
He's looking for you.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.112
Who?

19:15.195 --> 19:18.031
And if he finds you,
it's all over.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.367
You won't be able
to stop it.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.120
Stop what?

19:23.203 --> 19:26.206
(gasps)
The end of the world, dummy.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.461
(loud buzz, explosion)

19:47.394 --> 19:49.730
How are his vitals?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.730
Heart rate's up.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.648
BOZER:
Come on, Mac.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.859
Get what you need and get out.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.946
(sound snippets overlapping)

19:59.531 --> 20:01.825
(old-time jazz playing)

20:06.830 --> 20:07.748
You need a drink.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.459
And I need a cigarette.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.462
Oh, hand-rolled.
What do I look like, a farmer?

20:14.838 --> 20:17.466
(women laughing)

20:14.838 --> 20:17.466
WOMAN: Hi, handsome.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.677
Hi, handsome.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.677
Whoo-hoo.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.888
Do I know you?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.888
You do now.

20:22.971 --> 20:23.972
I'm Ellen.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.476
Oh, that is so trippy.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.105
It is a trip. Remember?
Come with me.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.148
Where are we going?

20:33.231 --> 20:35.651
I don't know, it's your dream.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.985
I-I know, but I'm--
I don't know what to do.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.613
I'm so confused.
I feel so lost.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.532
Well, figure it out, or I'll
keep dragging you around.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.702
Tesla. I'm-I'm here for--
I'm here for Tesla.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.872
George... I see you.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.124
(women cackling)

20:54.127 --> 20:55.754
Wait, don't leave me.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.845
How'd you get in here?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.723
Thomas, don't be rude.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.477
Edison, Bell.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.812
You guys are in
the photo with Tesla.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.063
He doesn't belong here.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.815
This is a party for scientists,

21:14.898 --> 21:17.693
not killers.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.569
I am a scientist.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.196
What are you doing here?

21:21.279 --> 21:22.864
I thought you
and Tesla were

21:22.948 --> 21:24.741
fighting over
electricity patents.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.035
Yes, but we overcame
our differences

21:27.119 --> 21:30.872
when we started working together
at DXS; a higher calling.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.124
We're trying
to save the world,

21:32.207 --> 21:33.959
not end it.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.003
And Tesla has
the good wine.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.380
(laughs)

21:36.086 --> 21:38.380
All right, well, I
need to talk to Tesla.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.756
So I need to get into this...

21:38.463 --> 21:39.756
EDISON:
Uh, you don't deserve

21:39.840 --> 21:43.135
to talk to Tesla. Move along.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.433
Hey.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.642
MacGYVER:
<i>When faced with obstacles</i>

21:50.726 --> 21:54.396
<i>in the dystopian nightmare</i>
<i>that is your subconscious,</i>

21:54.479 --> 21:55.856
<i>sometimes you need</i>
<i>a distraction</i>

21:55.939 --> 21:57.566
<i>so you don't careen</i>
<i>hopelessly down</i>

21:57.649 --> 21:59.026
<i>a shame spiral to oblivion.</i>

21:59.109 --> 22:01.403
BELL:
What is he doing?

22:01.486 --> 22:04.906
MacGYVER:
<i>Heat causes the glass</i>
<i>and the air inside the bottle</i>

22:04.990 --> 22:08.201
<i>to expand, allowing</i>
<i>the cork to be removed.</i>

22:10.203 --> 22:11.288
BELL:
Impressive.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.373
Excellent.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.792
I must try that sometime.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.919
Mr. Tesla will
see you now.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.258
Tesla, I really need...

22:27.929 --> 22:29.431
(panting)

22:29.514 --> 22:30.432
Donnie?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.811
ELLEN:
Ah. You remember

22:34.895 --> 22:37.522
your old friend Donald.

22:38.565 --> 22:42.611
As you know, DMT can bring up
all kinds of memories,

22:42.694 --> 22:46.365
including
your ninth grade bully.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.453
That was fun.
What's next?

22:56.333 --> 22:58.668
CHERYL:
That's the amygdala.
Long-term memory.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.629
We need short-term.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.629
What exactly are the odds

23:00.712 --> 23:03.757
his own adrenaline wakes
him up when he finds it?

23:03.840 --> 23:04.966
Low.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.343
How low?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.343
This is a DARPA

23:06.426 --> 23:07.260
experimental process.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.721
Science here is not
an exact science.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.265
TAYLOR:
<i>Right. It's not</i>

23:12.349 --> 23:14.309
a cryptokey.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.727
But this date
must mean something.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.937
DESI: Here,
check this out.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.147
Tesla wrote,
"I loved that pigeon

23:19.231 --> 23:21.817
"as a man loves a woman,
and she loved me.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.778
As long as I had her, there
was purpose to my life."

23:24.861 --> 23:26.947
I really hope Mac doesn't
turn out like this one day.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.283
That's it. That's it.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.328
Tesla's favorite pigeon
died in 1922,

23:33.411 --> 23:37.332
but he mentions her throughout
these letters dated 1937.

23:37.415 --> 23:38.667
Everyone thought Tesla
was going bonkers, right?

23:38.750 --> 23:42.337
But listen to this.
Uh, he writes,

23:42.420 --> 23:44.089
"Two beams of light shot

23:44.172 --> 23:48.135
out from her eyes, and I knew
my life's work was finished."

23:48.218 --> 23:50.303
These mentions
of the birds

23:50.387 --> 23:51.930
are code names for the
weapon, for Shiva.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.807
Exactly.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.183
DESI:
Here. Another letter,

23:55.267 --> 23:56.560
dated November 9, 1937.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.895
He describes laying her to rest.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.356
And then he also describes
building "an aureate cage,

24:01.439 --> 24:04.109
sheltered from the world's
harsh light."

24:04.943 --> 24:06.903
What if the location
of the pigeons

24:06.987 --> 24:08.947
is really where he hid Shiva?

24:09.906 --> 24:12.409
11, nine, 37--
see if they're coordinates.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.165
(grunts softly)

24:18.248 --> 24:21.751
Trying out different
combinations.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.545
It could be

24:23.628 --> 24:27.048
longitude 119,
latitude 37,

24:27.132 --> 24:29.551
but that's just a
ranch in California.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.555
"Aureate cage."

24:33.638 --> 24:35.015
See if there were any gold mines
in that ranch.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.725
Checking now.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.687
They mined gold
and iron there.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.731
That's the spot.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.731
KAREN:
You're not allowed back there.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.316
MAN:
Calm down, lady.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.568
This is for employees.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.569
DESI:
It's Codex.

24:47.652 --> 24:48.737
Time to go. They found us.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.697
You need to get
out of our way.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.073
One of Mac's distractions
would come

24:52.157 --> 24:53.950
in very handy right about now.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.369
Run.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.831
RILEY:
Brute force comes in handy, too.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.710
I'm so sorry.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.795
So, so sorry.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.131
I was so close.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.925
Why am I at the bar?

25:10.008 --> 25:12.886
Here. Have a martini.

25:14.846 --> 25:15.847
(exhales):
Thank you.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.729
Great. I'm in my own head
and I can't even get a drink.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.815
You better hide.
He's watching you.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.568
Okay, you keep
saying that, but who?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.278
You know who.

25:47.003 --> 25:50.465
Focus. You're getting lost
in your own head.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.510
Right. Tesla.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.096
I'm here to find Tesla.
Something about the map.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.808
(wind whooshing)

25:59.891 --> 26:02.143
(people screaming)

26:02.227 --> 26:03.645
(shouting, coughing)

26:09.734 --> 26:12.821
(strains):
Can't breathe. I can't breathe.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.739
(MacGyver gasping)

26:23.248 --> 26:25.250
(gasping)

26:35.969 --> 26:38.388
<i>It's him or the it's city.</i>

26:38.471 --> 26:40.849
Lasky.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.851
You remember me.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.145
Surprising, seeing
as you let me die.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.563
I had no choice.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.357
I let you die so that
everyone else could live.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.067
Look, I'm sorry.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.527
I'm so sorry, but...

26:52.610 --> 26:54.321
I'd trade places with you
if I could.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.697
I'm not buying it.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.866
And it's too late
for that, anyway.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.035
Now my kids will grow up
without a father.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.203
You know.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.789
Just like you did.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.755
(glass cracking)

27:11.838 --> 27:13.798
I hope he finds you.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.010
CHERYL:
<i>His vitals are spiking.</i>

27:17.093 --> 27:19.054
We can't do this
much longer.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.056
MATTY:
<i>Matty to Taylor, where you at?</i>

27:21.139 --> 27:23.141
TAYLOR:
<i>Uh, we're pulling up to</i>
<i>the ranch in Fresno County now.</i>

27:23.224 --> 27:25.018
<i>The coordinates</i>
<i>from Tesla's letters</i>

27:25.101 --> 27:28.229
indicate that this is the spot
he marked for Shiva.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.731
MATTY: Right.
But if what Mac says is true,

27:29.814 --> 27:31.733
and there's something weird
about that map,

27:31.816 --> 27:35.403
it might not actually lead us
to the weapon's location.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.031
At least that puts us
on equal terms with Codex.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.407
We all have
the same information.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.579
The only way
we are going to find

27:44.662 --> 27:47.582
Shiva's precise location
is if Mac remembers the clue

27:47.665 --> 27:50.251
that he found in the house.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.588
LASKY (echoes):
<i>I hope he finds you.</i>

27:55.673 --> 27:57.133
Where you going, Angus?

27:57.217 --> 27:58.093
Huh?

27:58.176 --> 28:00.220
I'm not going anywhere.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.388
Beat it, Lasky.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.349
I got this.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.146
It's covered in blood.

28:12.190 --> 28:15.402
I can't...
remember why I'm here.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.741
I can't even remember who I am.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.456
ELLEN:
Don't worry.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.166
I know who you are.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.423
Why are you so familiar?

28:41.386 --> 28:44.264
It has been a while, Angus.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.645
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider ♪

28:50.728 --> 28:54.607
♪ Climbed up
the water spout... ♪

29:05.076 --> 29:06.870
Mom.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.634
I can't believe
I didn't recognize you.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.511
Why would you?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.180
I died 25 years ago.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.890
You were five.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.689
Oh, no. Don't tell me.
(laughs softly)

29:34.772 --> 29:38.318
You think that I'm, you know...

29:38.401 --> 29:39.652
Hmm.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.988
File 47.

29:43.072 --> 29:46.201
You were hoping that the whole
thing wasn't really my idea.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.037
Why would your sweet
old mother hatch a plan

29:49.120 --> 29:52.624
to take out a quarter
of humanity?

29:56.002 --> 29:57.879
Is it true?

29:58.922 --> 30:01.299
You know it is.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.052
How could you do that?

30:04.135 --> 30:06.221
How-how could you think that
killing all those people

30:06.304 --> 30:07.764
is the answer to
saving the planet?

30:07.847 --> 30:09.682
Why'd you send Lasky
to his death?

30:09.766 --> 30:11.768
To save everyone else.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.774
I didn't want
this planet to die.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.693
And I was willing
to do what it took

30:20.777 --> 30:22.737
to make sure that
that never happened.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.822
Are you?

30:24.906 --> 30:27.909
There are other ways.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.953
The air scrubber?

30:30.036 --> 30:32.038
(chuckles softly)
It's adorable,

30:32.121 --> 30:33.456
but too little, too late.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.752
(sighs) This is not how
I wanted this to go.

30:41.965 --> 30:45.718
You missed most of my life.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.887
I was there.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.223
In your head, in your blood.

30:50.306 --> 30:55.562
I mean, you don't like onions,
and you're afraid of heights.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.981
That's me.

31:06.489 --> 31:09.075
Dad's gone.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.120
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.415
I've never felt so lost, ever.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.293
It's like the string

31:18.376 --> 31:20.461
that was holding me
to the ground snapped,

31:20.545 --> 31:23.464
and now I'm just floating away.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.009
Here? Or-or in reality?

31:26.092 --> 31:27.468
Both.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.554
(exhales)

31:30.555 --> 31:32.015
I really need you right now.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.434
Please, t-tell me
what I have to do.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.648
You know I love you,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.358
and I always will?

31:43.526 --> 31:45.486
Then you're ready.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.406
For what?

31:50.742 --> 31:52.577
Him.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.997
Mom! Mom!

32:02.420 --> 32:05.006
His fear centers
are lit up.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.007
Vitals are off the charts.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.509
We need to shut this down.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.344
MATTY:
Mac wouldn't want you
to shut this down.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.428
Not before
he gets what he needs.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.680
You don't know that.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.680
That's what he wanted, Bozer.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.683
Don't talk about Mac
in the past tense.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.851
(monitor beeping)

32:16.934 --> 32:18.227
Okay.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.572
RILEY:
Codex is digging a
quarter mile west

32:29.656 --> 32:31.866
of the coordinates.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.159
Hopefully, Mac was right
about the cipher,

32:33.242 --> 32:34.661
and they're
in the wrong spot.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.663
Only one way to find out.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.416
We'll take the back entrance.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.001
We need
to get that weapon

32:42.085 --> 32:43.044
before Codex does.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.088
And we can't wait for Mac.
Come on.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.055
<i>(echoing):</i>
<i>Who let the Boy Scout in?</i>

32:54.138 --> 32:55.264
No more distractions.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.557
I need to talk to Tesla
about the map.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.059
Gonna have to go
through me first.

33:01.979 --> 33:03.606
You're not a threat.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.691
You're just a
synapse misfire.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.693
Let Codex
have the weapon.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.569
Then nature
can take its course.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.072
You can be a hero
and save the world.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.199
Well... most of it.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.368
Without our humanity,
it's not worth it.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.078
You know Codex is right.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.246
No.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.206
It's the rational, logical,

33:20.289 --> 33:22.083
moral thing to do.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.459
No.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.459
If you didn't believe,

33:23.543 --> 33:25.253
deep down in your core,

33:25.336 --> 33:27.338
I wouldn't be standing here
talking to you.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.299
You're not me.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.635
I'm not you.
I'm not<i> you!</i>

33:49.193 --> 33:50.945
(exhales) Tesla.

33:51.028 --> 33:54.115
You're taking
too long, Angus.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.867
Your friends need you.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.954
TAYLOR:
We've been here before.

34:00.037 --> 34:02.290
I think we're lost. Ow!
Bugger!

34:02.373 --> 34:04.208
We need more light.

34:11.048 --> 34:12.633
Kerosene's dry on that one, too.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.553
RILEY: (sighs)
This is when we need Mac.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.890
Or just what he's taught us.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.975
DESI:
Mac told me

34:21.058 --> 34:24.645
he was going to use iron
for his carbon scrubber.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.690
But he decided it against it.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.317
Because iron...

34:30.276 --> 34:32.904
is flammable.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.615
Well done.

34:39.076 --> 34:42.163
Something about your map.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.499
I saw it. But why
can't I remember?

34:44.582 --> 34:46.042
Your mind
is cluttered.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.836
I know what that's like.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.671
I don't understand.
I got rid of everyone, so

34:50.755 --> 34:52.131
why am I still so lost?

34:52.215 --> 34:55.343
You're not lost. Slow down.

34:55.426 --> 34:59.180
Sometimes you think
you're going in one direction,

34:59.263 --> 35:01.182
but really,

35:01.265 --> 35:04.769
you're going in another.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.406
The compass was the clue.

35:19.575 --> 35:21.035
But it's wrong.

35:21.118 --> 35:24.163
West is east.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.251
And east is west.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.504
Wakey-wakey.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.389
(gasping)

35:41.472 --> 35:45.351
(panting)

35:45.434 --> 35:46.769
You're lucky.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.479
I was about
to<i> Pulp Fiction</i> ya.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.233
(exhales)

35:55.820 --> 35:56.696
TAYLOR:
Hang on.

35:56.779 --> 35:58.072
MacGYVER: Guys,
I know where the weapon is.

35:58.155 --> 35:59.574
Mac!
Mac, you're awake!

35:59.657 --> 36:02.535
What's the location?

35:59.657 --> 36:02.535
MacGYVER: So, the map, it said

36:02.618 --> 36:03.703
that you had to hike
a quarter mile

36:03.786 --> 36:04.912
west from the "X."

36:04.996 --> 36:06.247
But the compass on the ceiling
was flipped.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.082
So it's actually to hike
a quarter mile<i> east.</i>

36:08.165 --> 36:11.043
West is east.

36:08.165 --> 36:11.043
TAYLOR: East.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.087
East, got it.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.389
TAYLOR:
There, that door.

36:31.063 --> 36:32.523
The weapon must be in here.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.442
So how we do get it out of here?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.655
I have an idea.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.409
(grunting, groaning)

36:43.492 --> 36:44.952
RILEY:
This thing weighs a ton.

36:46.245 --> 36:48.414
Almost... there!

36:50.541 --> 36:52.251
(exhales)

37:07.266 --> 37:08.976
Magnetic fields?

37:09.060 --> 37:11.646
No.
Magnetic bursts.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.606
(over comms):
Taylor to Matty.
We have the device.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.982
But Codex are
blocking our path.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.692
Easy now!

37:16.776 --> 37:18.444
Keep pushing that cart forward,

37:18.527 --> 37:20.112
and we'll get out of here
in one piece.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.198
You sure you want to fire
a gun off in an abandoned mine?

37:26.994 --> 37:28.621
We can wait.

37:28.704 --> 37:31.165
We've got snacks.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.834
I hate her.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.834
Time for a new plan.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.336
Which is?

37:33.918 --> 37:35.336
I don't know, but we need one.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.923
I got one: retreat!

37:35.419 --> 37:38.923
Right.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.842
SCARLETT:
Damn it.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.511
Let's go.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.679
Slowly.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.722
This could be a trap.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.268
They're catching up!

37:51.352 --> 37:52.812
MacGYVER:
Are those Codex agents

37:52.895 --> 37:54.355
wearing Kevlar vests,
by any chance?

37:54.438 --> 37:56.691
Yeah. Why?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.693
Okay, good. I have an idea,
but you need to get some space

37:58.776 --> 37:59.735
between you and them.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.071
Yes, we're
working on it!

38:10.121 --> 38:11.372
Help me push the cart
against the door.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.415
MacGYVER:
Desi, open Tesla's trunk.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.209
(Riley and Taylor grunting)

38:15.292 --> 38:17.044
DESI:
Russ!

38:18.129 --> 38:19.714
(grunting)

38:24.427 --> 38:26.012
Mac? There's something else
in the trunk.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.556
It looks like some sort
of hand crank.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.556
MacGYVER: Great.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.850
That should be a power source.
I think it's a generator.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.893
Well, it looks broken,
because the wires are crumbling.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.895
All right, well, we
need to get it working.

38:34.979 --> 38:35.771
DESI:
Why?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.148
'Cause you're gonna use it.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.362
Russ!

38:44.947 --> 38:47.033
We can't hold them much longer!

38:44.947 --> 38:47.033
What now, Mac?

38:47.116 --> 38:48.075
All right, you need wire.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.996
Uh-- Look for a telegraph wire
or a mining phone.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.921
MacGYVER:
<i>Even Tesla had to stand</i>
<i>on the shoulders of giants.</i>

39:01.005 --> 39:02.923
<i>And in this case, it was</i>
<i>the great Michael Faraday...</i>

39:03.007 --> 39:04.425
Hurry! Power that thing!

39:03.007 --> 39:04.425
I'm working on it!

39:04.508 --> 39:07.678
MacGYVER:
<i>...who discovered that moving</i>
<i>a wire in a magnetic field</i>

39:07.762 --> 39:09.472
<i>produces electricity.</i>

39:15.352 --> 39:17.396
Mac, It's working!

39:15.352 --> 39:17.396
MacGYVER:
Good. Let them through,

39:17.480 --> 39:18.606
and let her rip.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.066
Out of the way!

39:29.533 --> 39:31.577
(grunting)

39:35.706 --> 39:37.708
(static on comms)

39:39.543 --> 39:41.504
Desi, report.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.504
(static continues)

39:45.549 --> 39:48.094
MacGYVER:
Desi? Say something, please.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.847
We're okay.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.599
(sighs)

39:56.102 --> 39:57.186
What happened?

39:57.269 --> 39:59.355
MacGYVER:
The metal strike plates

39:59.438 --> 40:01.941
in the Kevlar vests were made
with conducting metals.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.984
Which is why Tesla's
electromagnet

40:04.068 --> 40:05.319
was able to toss them around

40:05.402 --> 40:07.905
like rag dolls.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.159
She's gone.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.454
TAYLOR:
All right, then.

40:15.538 --> 40:19.041
Let's pack this up
and get the hell out of here.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.796
MATTY:
<i>What do they want</i>
<i>with this thing?</i>

40:23.879 --> 40:27.049
I'm not sure,
but it's capable of producing

40:27.133 --> 40:28.843
a powerful magnetic burst, so,

40:28.926 --> 40:31.011
it might be a weapon
designed to

40:31.095 --> 40:34.056
disable other weapons.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.683
Well...

40:35.766 --> 40:37.643
it's here for you to dissect,

40:37.726 --> 40:39.979
whenever you're feeling
up to it.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.857
What a hangover.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.525
Even my headache has a headache.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.860
RILEY:
I'd hate to get lost
inside the mind

40:45.943 --> 40:47.653
of Angus MacGyver.

40:47.736 --> 40:52.032
(chuckles) Yeah. Me, too.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.993
What was it like in there?

40:54.076 --> 40:56.871
ELLEN:
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider... ♪

40:56.954 --> 40:58.747
<i>You should be hiding.</i>
<i>He's looking for you.</i>

40:58.831 --> 41:01.500
DESI:
You okay?

41:03.127 --> 41:06.338
Yeah. It was fine.

41:06.422 --> 41:10.259
It was like a...
surreal dream, that's all.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.022
Smells good.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.691
I'm making soup.
(chuckles)

41:29.904 --> 41:32.239
Hey, Mac?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.908
Hmm?

41:35.951 --> 41:37.578
Did you want
to talk about anything?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.371
What do you mean?

41:39.455 --> 41:41.790
You seem different.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.084
(sighs)

41:44.168 --> 41:46.170
I'm just tired.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.716
Okay.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.761
I got you something.

41:59.225 --> 42:02.478
(chuckles)

41:59.225 --> 42:02.478
I am not the only one
that talks in my sleep.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.275
Hey, Mac...

42:10.569 --> 42:12.279
You're not lost.
