not you.

I'm coming back.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.801
I said it.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.636
I meant it.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.557
I understand what it's like

00:57.641 --> 01:00.768
to lose someone
that you care about deeply.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.187
They're not lost. Not yet.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.773
We have to go back to Caprica.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.570
Given the current situation, I'm
afraid that I have no alternative

01:10.654 --> 01:13.948
but to announce that I am, as of
now, a candidate for the Presidency.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.156
Thank you, Tory.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.459
No one should be under any illusions
about what we're gonna face here.

02:48.544 --> 02:51.337
Our final jump will take us
intra-atmosphere,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.506
less than two clicks
above the surface.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.636
We're also expecting
to take heavy fire.

of up to 20% can be expected.

has been designated

03:06.895 --> 03:09.063

right now, but if you have faith,

03:21.952 --> 03:24.370
everything will turn out
exactly as it should.

Oh.

Sorry about the mess.
It's a bit of a ritual.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.145
Superstition, really.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.398

04:02.492 --> 04:05.786
Yeah, my father used to break
pencils before he went into court,

04:05.871 --> 04:07.538
then borrow one
from the clerk.

(LAUGHING)

05:00.467 --> 05:03.177
What many of you don't know is
that the captured Cylon Heavy Raider

05:03.261 --> 05:06.472
is capable of much longer
jumps than our Raptors.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.599
In fact, we realized early on

05:08.684 --> 05:11.018
that if we could install the
Heavy Raider navigational system

05:11.103 --> 05:12.853
aboard one of our Raptors,

05:13.313 --> 05:16.065
a strike team could make the
entire trip back to Caprica

05:16.566 --> 05:18.025
in less than 10 jumps.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.653
Now, the limiting factor
up until now

05:20.737 --> 05:24.907
has been our inability to install
the Cylon computer with our computer.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.452

has now been overcome.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.138

05:47.597 --> 05:49.598
She's gonna lay out
our navigational markers

05:49.683 --> 05:50.891
and update
our jump coordinates.

have a problem with that?

And if we need to use a Cylon
to get them back, then so be it.

survivors off Caprica as we can.

long. I want to hear it, too.

think about something serious.

as we await Madam President.

Laura Roslin is very much ahead
in the polls at this point.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.867
she's entering the room shortly, but
still, of course, waiting for her.

He is capable
of blindsiding her

09:43.208 --> 09:45.793
as he did when he launched
his candidacy a month ago.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.295
Dr. Baltar, of course,
has long been admired

09:48.380 --> 09:51.382
as one of the most brilliant
scientific minds of his generation

09:51.466 --> 09:55.261
and played a critical role in saving
the human race from the Cylon threat.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.723
Yes, here comes
the President now.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.309
Laura Roslin, the President,
has entered the room.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.776

with you, Gaius.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.319
...shake hands,
exchange a few words.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.989
You must be
losing your mind again.

you can come up with,

is coming, Helo.

I can feel it lurking
out there, waiting.

What do you mean?
Back on Caprica?

10:59.617 --> 11:00.743
No.

11:01.828 --> 11:06.498
Not on a mission,
not any specific thing.

I'm Brother Cavil. I understand
you've asked for religious counseling.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.085
I never really believed in
psychotherapy. My father was a priest.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.296
I see.

13:17.380 --> 13:21.800
You thought you'd have an easier time
with a priest than a real doctor. Okay.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.344
I pray to the gods

13:25.221 --> 13:26.388
every night,

13:27.724 --> 13:29.683
but I don't think
they listen to me.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.519
Do you know
how useless prayer is?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.814
Chanting and singing

13:35.899 --> 13:40.110
and mucking about with old
half-remembered lines of bad poetry,

13:41.905 --> 13:43.572
and you know
what it gets you?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.157
Exactly nothing.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.078
Are you sure
you're a priest?

13:51.039 --> 13:54.208
I've been preaching longer than
you've been sucking down oxygen.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.044
And in that time,
I've learned enough to know

13:57.128 --> 14:00.714
that the gods
don't answer prayers.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.719
We're here on our own. That's
the way they set things up.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.974
We have to find our own answers,
our own way out of the wilderness

14:11.184 --> 14:15.312
without a nice little sunny path all
laid out in front of us in advance.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.939
That's what I'm trying to do.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.690
I'm trying to find my way.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.067

much, much bigger than that

Yes, I'm not sure
if you're aware, Tom,

habit of electing ungodly apostates

16:39.415 --> 16:41.500

Things are gonna
turn around. You'll see.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.512
Of course. How blind I'm
being. Thank you, yes.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.514
"Things are gonna turn around.
You'll see. "

16:55.598 --> 16:56.890
What is that? Advice?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.352
Well, thank you. Thank
you for your keen insight,

17:00.436 --> 17:02.104
your astounding
political acumen.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.523
You know,
I'm so assured right now, Tom,

17:04.607 --> 17:07.192
I'm just gonna sit right back
and wait for the hand of God

17:07.276 --> 17:09.444
to reach down and change
my political fortunes.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.612
How about that?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.331
Galactica, Starbuck.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.668
SAR squadron confirms readiness
check, and we are spun up out here

17:24.752 --> 17:26.253
and ready for the first jump.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.715
DUALLA: You are go
for the jump, Starbuck.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.174
Roger that.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.594
Jump in ten minutes. Mark.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.846
(BEEPING)

17:37.640 --> 17:39.891
Galactica,
I'd like to speak with Actual.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.602
Sir?

17:46.441 --> 17:47.482
Actual. Go.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.484
Did I ever say thank you?

17:50.403 --> 17:53.655
No, but then again, that
would be a first, wouldn't it?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.076
Thank you.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.912
Just come back in one piece.
That'll be thank you enough.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.165
Good hunting.
Actual out.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.136
SAR Team, Starbuck. Set navcom
inputs to coordinate re-check.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.598
Standby for bounce-back
and stabilization routines.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.349
Let's do
a final check, people.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.310
Headcase. Check.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.686
Swordsman. Check.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.772
Anvil. Check. I still can't
believe you talked me into this.

18:26.856 --> 18:27.856
Chinstrap. Check.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.274
It's important.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.859
Gumball. Check.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.320
And I'll be with you
there and back.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.280
It's you and me from now on,
no matter what.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.116
Just like we agreed.

18:38.201 --> 18:41.953
I know. I know. I really
appreciate it, Helo. I really do.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.330
Raw Meat. Check.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.415
Toyon. Check.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.834
Strakus. Check.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.170
I just can't get her
out of my head,

18:51.297 --> 18:52.631
our little girl.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.216
Playboy. Check.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.928
Polo. Check.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.057
Casey. Check.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.643
Adonis. Check.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.436
Is there a problem?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.155
Gully Man. Check.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.448
Star Cloud. Check.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.574
Racetrack. Check.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.909
Callan. Check.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.828
Wireless check complete.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.789
Board is green,
and we are set.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.916
Sharon, you're on.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.762
Ready.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.764
SAR Team, Starbuck.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.267
Standby to jump on my mark.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.309
Five.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.103
Here we go.
Four.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.187
Three.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.230
Two.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.356
One.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.983
Commence the first jump.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.790
This doesn't look right.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.713
No other contacts on dradis.

20:14.797 --> 20:15.797
What?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.467
Oh, man. We're at the
wrong jump coordinates.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.474
Frak!

20:26.559 --> 20:28.894
Helo, we've lost
someone already.

20:29.604 --> 20:30.854
It's Racetrack.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.105
Should we go back?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.192
Mission rules say we keep
going unless we lose three,

20:36.277 --> 20:37.652
so we keep going.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.405
Racetrack will just have to
find her way back to base.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.450
It's a hell of a way
to start, though.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.536
Let's... Let's talk
about what happened.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.418
I can't really believe
that Cally...

20:53.836 --> 20:58.214
I don't understand how
I could do that to Cally.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.550
It's like it's a nightmare.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.677
(CALLY SCREAMING)

21:03.346 --> 21:06.181
She said you were asleep
when she found you.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.850
Were you having a nightmare
when she woke you up?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.854
I don't remember.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.524
Oh.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.487
Been having
any recurring dreams lately?

21:25.201 --> 21:26.201
No.

21:27.578 --> 21:32.540
Okay, that's what we in
the pray trade call a lie.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.543
And lies aren't gonna get you
anywhere, my friend.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.963
So skip over the denials
and the deceptions,

21:38.047 --> 21:40.548
and let's get right down
to it, shall we?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.676
You're having dreams.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.928
What are they?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.565
Tell me
about your dream, Chief.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.795
Every night...
Every night it's the same.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.881
For how long?

23:46.550 --> 23:47.801
Couple of weeks.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.261
And you were having
the same dream

23:50.346 --> 23:52.180
when Cally woke you up,
weren't you?

23:54.475 --> 23:56.893
I don't know.
I don't remember. Maybe.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.771
Maybe. It doesn't matter,
does it?

23:59.980 --> 24:03.858
All I remember is Cally on
the ground and the blood.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.860
She stopped you.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.405
By waking you up, she
prevented you from carrying out

24:09.490 --> 24:11.407
your secret desire
to kill yourself.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.248
I don't have a secret desire
to kill myself.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.708
Well, actually, you're right.
It's not a secret.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.129
You obviously want to kill
yourself. Question is, why?

24:28.968 --> 24:32.220
Look, I think there was some kind
of glitch in the navcom firmware.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.514
Hey, bottom line,
we're to hell and gone

24:34.598 --> 24:36.683
from where we're supposed
to be, Skipper.

24:39.436 --> 24:43.064
Okay, any chance that we
can still catch up with them?

24:43.566 --> 24:46.776
Not a chance. Mission
rules say we head back.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.989
Frak me!
It was the first jump!

24:51.073 --> 24:52.323
Hey, look, you gave me
these coordinates.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.867
Yeah...

24:54.785 --> 24:56.244
(MUTTERING)

24:57.329 --> 24:59.080
Back to the barn.

25:00.583 --> 25:04.586
Hey, I'm picking up
a large planetary body.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.338
It's frakking close.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.303
Where did that
come from?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.013
Hell if I know.

25:15.097 --> 25:18.308
There's so much dradis interference
here, it didn't even register.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.435
Let's check this out.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.817
Atmosphere
is nitrogen-oxygen.

25:27.902 --> 25:31.988
Organic molecular spectra.
Fresh water.

25:35.117 --> 25:39.078
Hey, you know what this is?
It's habitable.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.876
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.382
Maybe we're not just a
bunch of frakups after all.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.976
Now, the climate readings
overall are within human norms.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.481
Oh, there's some extremes at the
poles that we couldn't withstand,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.107
but that's not unusual.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.235
Well done.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.153
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

26:12.446 --> 26:16.658
We got a mottled area here at the
river mouth, so it's probably a delta,

26:16.742 --> 26:19.661
and chances are we've got
significant plant and animal life,

26:19.745 --> 26:22.497
so I want a lot of nice
low passes across here.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.965
I heard the Pegasus survey
mission found wildlife.

26:33.217 --> 26:37.095
Fruit trees,
rivers of milk and honey.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.682
Yeah, you forgot the lakes
of ambrosia.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.268
Most of the planet
is actually pretty barren.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.355
Plant and animal life located in a
temperate belt around the equator.

26:47.690 --> 26:51.901
But the best part is, with all the
dradis interference from the nebula,

26:53.028 --> 26:55.029
the Cylons will probably
never find it.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.662
BALTAR: Who cares about
this stupid planet anyway?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.626
All this song and dance
over nothing.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.047
Less than 20% of that place
actually supports human life, so...

27:13.799 --> 27:15.717
You're not seeing
the big picture.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.719
This is your new home,

27:17.928 --> 27:19.804
the place where
you will lead a new life.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.806
This is the future, Gaius.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.766
Now, there's
a depressing thought.

27:25.728 --> 27:26.686
What's that?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.479
Oh, nothing, Tom.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.606
Just...

27:32.568 --> 27:35.445
Can you imagine if we actually
had to live on that thing?

27:41.702 --> 27:45.538
You are a genius.

27:46.749 --> 27:47.874
And?

27:47.958 --> 27:50.543
Pay attention. You're
about to win the election.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.422
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Tom?

27:54.506 --> 27:58.134
We needed an issue, something
to set us apart from Roslin,

27:58.218 --> 28:01.554
something to put her clearly on
the wrong side of a major issue

28:01.638 --> 28:03.598
our people
care passionately about.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.725
This is it.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.809
(CHUCKLING)

28:07.519 --> 28:09.979
Permanent settlement
on this planet.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.945
Permanent settlement, here?

28:19.365 --> 28:20.865
Have you lost your marbles?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.534
It may look dreary.
It may be dreary.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.370
But it's solid ground
under your feet

28:25.454 --> 28:27.205
and real sky
over your head.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.750
You'd be surprised what a
powerful idea that is to people

28:30.834 --> 28:33.211
cooped up in metal boxes
for nine months.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.088
You should
listen to him, Gaius.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.383
He's a smart, sexy man,
just like you.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.344
Oh, give up.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.472
What?

28:45.808 --> 28:47.642
Give up on Earth.

28:50.771 --> 28:51.938
Yes.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.907
So we'd settle here.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.409
Yes.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.993
(CHUCKLING)

29:13.085 --> 29:14.168
(CHUCKLING)

29:15.838 --> 29:17.088
You know,
it's starting to look

29:17.172 --> 29:19.465
like a lovely little planet
after all.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.728
This is a rest stop, a place
to load up on food and water.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.647
We're not
settling here, obviously.

29:34.731 --> 29:35.898
You've heard
the captains' reports.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.317
Every ship in the fleet
has people begging, pleading,

29:38.402 --> 29:40.278
demanding they get time
down on the surface,

29:40.362 --> 29:42.238
even if it's only
for a few hours.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.573
Well, a few hours
is one thing,

29:43.657 --> 29:46.075
but permanent settlement's
quite another.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.162
Suddenly, Baltar is holding
out hope of breathing real air,

29:49.246 --> 29:52.582
growing real food, sleeping
in a bed instead of a bunk,

29:52.666 --> 29:54.750
living in a house
instead of a ship.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.753
It's a fantasy.
Look at the mission reports.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.631
All the data indicate that life
on this planet would be hard.

30:00.716 --> 30:03.801
It would be a struggle to even
eke a living out for a few years.

30:03.886 --> 30:07.138
Today's polls show that he's
also making headway with the idea

30:07.222 --> 30:10.475
that because the planet
is hidden in a nebula,

30:10.559 --> 30:13.352
it will provide
a refuge from the Cylons.

30:14.605 --> 30:17.440
What, are we now assuming
that Cylon technology

30:17.524 --> 30:21.319
is not sufficient enough to find
this planet? We just found it.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.737
Madam President,
in my opinion,

30:22.821 --> 30:25.740
people vote their hopes,
not their fears.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.326
Baltar is offering them
what they want to hear,

30:28.410 --> 30:30.328
and you're offering them
a bitter reality.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.662
I'm offering them
the truth.

30:31.747 --> 30:36.125
They don't want to hear the
truth. They're tired, exhausted.

30:37.211 --> 30:40.546
The idea of stopping,
laying down their burdens

30:40.631 --> 30:42.423
and starting a new life
right now

30:42.508 --> 30:44.675
is what is resonating
with the voters.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.969
How well is it resonating?

30:48.764 --> 30:51.057
It could turn
the entire election around.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.105
Why are you running?

30:59.691 --> 31:00.983
I'm not.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.194
How long
are you gonna do this?

31:03.278 --> 31:05.112
How long are you gonna
refuse to see

31:05.197 --> 31:07.240
what's right in front
of your face?

31:09.201 --> 31:12.787
How... Forget it. I'm done.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.165
What? You're leaving?

31:16.250 --> 31:17.833
That's right. I'm done.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.253
I'm done dancing
around the truth with you.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.421
You know what's going on,

31:22.506 --> 31:25.967
but you can't
or you won't face it, so...

31:27.678 --> 31:28.844
I'm not a therapist.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.222
I'm not gonna hold your hand
and help you along.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.724
I'm just trying to get you right
with yourself and with your gods,

31:33.809 --> 31:35.268
but you're not willing
to do it.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.727
But...

31:36.812 --> 31:38.479
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.065
Oh, for gods' sake,
Chief, come on!

31:42.276 --> 31:43.693
You think you're a Cylon.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.448
I am not a Cylon.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.788
Well, of course you're not,

31:56.164 --> 31:58.374
but that's what you're
afraid of, isn't it?

31:58.625 --> 32:03.004
That you might be a Cylon and not
even know it, just like Boomer, right?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.298
Right?

32:06.425 --> 32:10.845
That's the thought that's torturing
your dreams and crippling your soul.

32:11.138 --> 32:15.808
"I'm a Cylon, just like
Sharon, and I deserve to die. "

32:20.772 --> 32:25.943
Sharon didn't know
what she was.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.907
She just kept thinking...

32:31.992 --> 32:36.287
Feeling that she was gonna do
this terrible thing,

32:36.663 --> 32:40.041
but she knew that she had to
stop herself before she did.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.046
And you think that's what you're
going to do, some terrible thing.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.591
Well, the truth is,
you might,

32:48.759 --> 32:50.718
but not
because you're a Cylon,

32:51.303 --> 32:52.762
because you're a human being

32:52.846 --> 32:55.848
and human beings do
terrible things all the time.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.559
Well, how do you know
I'm human?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.479
Oh, well, maybe
because I'm a Cylon,

33:01.563 --> 33:04.440
and I've never seen you
at any of the meetings.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.489
There's not much more
I can do for you.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.574
You're gonna have
to go back to work

33:13.659 --> 33:15.743
and try and leave all of this
behind you.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.747
No, I...

33:21.083 --> 33:22.416
I can't.

33:23.168 --> 33:26.253
I can't go back and face the
deck people again. Are you...

33:27.339 --> 33:28.673
And Cally!

33:28.757 --> 33:32.218
Well, you better. That's
the only family you've got.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.846
Just know that that's your
family and that they love you.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.433
Even Cally.
Especially Cally.

33:40.769 --> 33:44.689
If you doubt your humanity and your
essential nature as a human being,

33:44.773 --> 33:46.691
all you need to do
is look to them

33:46.775 --> 33:49.360
for the salvation you've
been seeking from the gods.

33:50.070 --> 33:55.116
The gods lift up those
who lift each other, Chief.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.376
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We are set here.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.378
Stand by
for final jump to Caprica.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.256
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.

34:10.340 --> 34:15.511
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms, anything.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.388
Roger that, Starbuck.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.723
Ready?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.599
Ready.

34:22.352 --> 34:24.562
Here we go. Jump.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.789
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Form up on me.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.249
Copy that, Skipper.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.418
Any Cylons, Helo?

34:48.170 --> 34:49.879
Nothing on dradis.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.007
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

34:53.133 --> 34:56.469
We're missing a Raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.

34:56.553 --> 35:00.264
We're missing Raptor 612.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.933
That's Toughguy
and Carousel.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.935
What, they jumped
to the wrong coordinates?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.520
No, no, no.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.689
I'm picking up their
transponder, so they made it.

35:08.774 --> 35:13.444
Bearing 827 carom 443,
about a half click from here.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.279
That would put them...

35:17.657 --> 35:18.949
Oh, my gods.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.576
Where, Helo? Talk to me.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.373
They jumped
inside the mountain.

35:29.711 --> 35:30.878
Damn.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.717
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We've lost Raptor 612.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.594
We are proceeding
without them.

35:39.805 --> 35:40.846
Follow me.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.139
Roger that, Starbuck.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.566
BALTAR: So I would think
that my position

35:52.651 --> 35:55.110
and the position of my
campaign is abundantly clear.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.195
Thank you.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.322
McMANUS: Madam President, you
have 30 seconds to respond.

35:58.406 --> 36:01.909
Well, my initial response is,
there he goes again.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.828
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,

36:03.912 --> 36:07.873
Dr. Baltar is distorting
the real issues before us.

36:07.958 --> 36:11.168
The issue here,
the real question, is not

36:11.253 --> 36:14.338
allowing the scriptures to dictate
the policy of this government.

36:14.422 --> 36:19.426
The question is, do the scriptures
contain real-world relevance?

36:19.970 --> 36:24.640
Do they contain the information
necessary to guide us to a safer home

36:24.724 --> 36:26.475
than some
completely unknown planet

36:26.560 --> 36:28.143
that we've
just now discovered?

36:28.228 --> 36:30.646
Obviously, my answer
to that question is yes.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.190
I have always
and will continue to feel

36:33.275 --> 36:36.110
the scriptures hold
real-world relevance.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.822
Mr. Vice President,
the next question is for you.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.199
How do you respond
to the charges

36:42.284 --> 36:44.535
that you've seized the idea of
permanent settlement on this planet

36:44.619 --> 36:46.579
as an opportunistic gamble?

36:46.663 --> 36:49.707
Some would say it's to be
construed as a desperate move

36:49.791 --> 36:52.835
from a campaign that was
falling behind in every poll.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.253
Well, you know,
that is...

36:54.337 --> 36:57.047
That is an excellent question,
in fact, Jim. Thank you.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.384
And I am only too glad to have
the opportunity to respond to it.

37:00.468 --> 37:04.054
You see, I have long been a
proponent in the search for Earth.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.558
The promise of perhaps
finding not only a new home

37:07.642 --> 37:09.143
but also the prospect
of discovering

37:09.227 --> 37:13.439
our long lost brothers and sisters
of the 13th Colony is a powerful one,

37:13.523 --> 37:16.150
and one I have believed in
heart and soul,

37:16.234 --> 37:20.237
but the trouble is, the Cylons
continue to follow us

37:21.156 --> 37:23.824
as they have done
every step of the way

37:23.909 --> 37:26.243
since the destruction
of the Colonies.

37:26.328 --> 37:31.498
And if we have a chance to change this
dynamic, to stop this deadly chase,

37:32.500 --> 37:35.711
shouldn't we take it?
My answer is yes.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.921
MAN: Oh, yeah. Come on.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.089
Thank you.
Madam President, 30 seconds.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.842
There's no assurance,
none whatsoever,

37:42.218 --> 37:44.762
that the Cylons don't already
know about this planet,

37:44.846 --> 37:47.431
that they don't make regular
stops here looking for us,

37:47.515 --> 37:50.267
and that, in fact, they aren't
simply waiting for us

37:50.352 --> 37:51.810
to settle on the surface
so they can attack us...

37:51.895 --> 37:54.605
I have to respond to that. I
simply have to respond to that.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.398
I'll give you 15 seconds.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.025
What you've seen right now,
ladies and gentlemen,

37:58.109 --> 38:02.529
is another example of the President
using fear to drive her campaign.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.907
Fear.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.159
Fear of the gods.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.454
Fear of the Cylon.
Fear of fear itself.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.539
Is it not time
to stop being afraid?

38:14.042 --> 38:15.417
I'm asking all of us

38:17.170 --> 38:20.881
to stop running from our lives
and start living them.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.841
Thank you.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.177
Thank you. That is all
we have time for today.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.305
I'd like to thank both the
candidates for their frankness today.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.598
A very exciting debate.

38:29.683 --> 38:32.935
And this concludes the cycle of
the debates for the Presidency.

38:33.395 --> 38:36.563
The polls will open
in three days. Please vote.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.399
Thank you and good night.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.609
(WHISPERING)

38:40.902 --> 38:42.444
Not your night, I guess.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.905
Why don't you go
frak yourself?

38:47.826 --> 38:51.996
MAN: (ON RADIO) With me now is campaign
manager for Dr. Baltar, Mr. Tom Zarek.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.581
Tom, welcome. You were
in there with us today.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.208
What was your impression?

38:56.710 --> 39:00.587
ZAREK: Well, I thought Dr.
Baltar did exceptionally well.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.506
Laid out
his vision of the future

39:02.590 --> 39:05.217
and offered the people a way
to end the suffering and terror

39:05.301 --> 39:06.844
that defines
so many of their lives.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.179
On the other hand,
I found myself wondering

39:09.264 --> 39:13.225
how Roslin's arguments against
settlement could possibly win.

39:46.509 --> 39:50.054
(WHISPERING) Watch your footing
over here. On me. Let's go.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.395
Get up to that line,
right there.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.480
Got it?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.359
All right, hold it.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.325
Let's figure out
where we are, Karl.

40:25.799 --> 40:30.344
Resistance base camp
was still another click ahead.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.124
You got
a Samuel T. Anders there?

41:04.712 --> 41:06.672
BAROLAY: Is there
a Kara Thrace there?

41:07.382 --> 41:11.051
If there is, you tell her she took
her good sweet time getting here.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.015
Friendlies.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.627
What took you so long?

41:46.045 --> 41:47.838
We got Marines and Raptors.

41:47.922 --> 41:50.340
We're gonna get you and your
people out of here, okay?

41:50.425 --> 41:51.884
As good as your word, huh?

41:51.968 --> 41:54.052
Yeah, good as
my frakking word.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.180
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?

41:56.264 --> 41:58.140
Now you feel like a big
frakking idiot, don't you?

41:58.224 --> 42:00.726
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?

42:00.810 --> 42:04.563
Okay, people, this is nice,
but we have toasters on our ass.

42:04.647 --> 42:06.773
Where are the rest
of your people?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.275
This is it.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.777
Toasters hit our base camp
this morning.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.279
I lost half my crew.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.072

42:29.088 --> 42:30.088
Back to the Raptors!

42:30.173 --> 42:31.215
No!

42:31.299 --> 42:33.467
The shell trajectories are
between us and the Raptors!

42:33.551 --> 42:35.093
We're cut off!

42:36.179 --> 42:37.471
MARINE: Men down!
