00:15.682 --> 00:19.603
[Eep]
<i>Hi, we're the Croods of Ahhh! Valley.</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:22.689
<i>Or at least we were, until my dad
got fed up with the place</i>

00:22.773 --> 00:25.275
<i>and decided to vacate and shun it.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:28.529
<i>On our vacate-shun, we met the Broods...</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.073
<i>who seemed really nice.</i>

00:31.156 --> 00:34.826
<i>But they were actually only using us
to get to Ahhh! Valley.</i>

00:34.910 --> 00:37.287
<i>They tried to bump us off.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:40.123
<i>But we escaped just in time...</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:42.459
<i>to be eaten.</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:43.669
- [Grug] Hello!
- [Eep] Help!

00:43.752 --> 00:45.545
[Gran]
Get me outta here!

00:45.629 --> 00:48.298
[Ugga] Anybody out there?
Anybody at all?

00:48.382 --> 00:51.301
- Hi, Croods.
- [Ugga] Anybody but her.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.636
[groans]

00:52.719 --> 00:56.473
Oh, don't worry, we're not here
to laugh at your misery.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.184
We're not? Not even just a little?

00:59.268 --> 01:01.895
Okay, maybe just a little.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.981
[laughing]

01:04.815 --> 01:07.818
[sighs] That felt good.
Didn't that feel good?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.028
Am I the only one?
Anybody? No?

01:10.112 --> 01:14.283
Well, enjoy being painfully digested
over the next six moons.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.493
[scoffs] Eep can't even die fast.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.370
[Eep] I'll make you die fast!

01:18.453 --> 01:20.664
- [grunts] Come back!
- [chuckles] Pathetic.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.292
Well, we best get going.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.211
Busy day for us,
moving to Aha Valley and all.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.855
[Grug]
You're still not saying it right.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.840
From your throat: Ahhh! Valley.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.884
Mm-hmm. Then we have to chase out
all the people who live there,

01:32.968 --> 01:34.511
start devouring all their food.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.346
Oh! Such a full day.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.765
- Say goodbye, family.
- [grunts]

01:38.849 --> 01:41.935
- Later, Cruds.
- Enjoy being digested!

01:42.019 --> 01:45.814
[sighs]
I still wish we got to eat them.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.399
[growling]

01:47.482 --> 01:49.043
[Grug]
Maybe we could fight our way out.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.236
[grunting]

01:51.320 --> 01:53.572
[growling and snarling]

01:53.655 --> 01:57.618
Oh, you didn't like that?
Croods, let's give this guy a bellyache.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.203
[snarling and whimpering]

02:04.124 --> 02:06.835
- [Thunk] Tickles.
- [Eep gasps] Good idea, Thunk.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.503
We shouldn't be fighting,
we should be tickling.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.383
[Thunk] Of course! Watch out, Eep,
here comes the tickle monster!

02:13.467 --> 02:16.011
[Eep]
Don't! No, not me, tickle him.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.929
[Grug]
Tickle, tickle.

02:20.766 --> 02:24.728
- [Ugga] Tickle harder! Show no mercy!
- [growling laughter]

02:24.811 --> 02:26.855
[retching]

02:27.856 --> 02:28.899
[grunting]

02:31.818 --> 02:34.738
[groans]
Next time I choose death.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.406
Where's Thunk?

02:37.949 --> 02:39.618
How'd you get out of the...

02:39.701 --> 02:41.036
I don't want to talk about it.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.414
We need to warn Ahhh! Valley
about the Broods.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.708
[groans]
And a clean pelt wouldn't hurt.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.669
Yeah, but they must be
halfway to the valley by now.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.964
We'll never beat them,
so wanna go this way?

02:55.217 --> 02:57.469
Or we could go this way instead.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.596
Dad, we need to go back.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.390
It's our home.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.226
And it being in danger
is pretty much entirely our fault.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.103
Eh, they can all take care of themselves.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.771
They'll be fine...

03:07.854 --> 03:10.023
except maybe Snoot.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.566
So win-win.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.195
Aww, come on,
don't make me go back there.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.739
The people are so annoying.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.201
<i>♪ Bom-bom bom-bom-dah ♪</i>

03:21.284 --> 03:23.078
<i>♪ Bom-bom-bom bom-bah-dah♪</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:24.329
<i>♪ Bah-dah-bah ♪</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:29.376
<i>♪ Free food! ♪</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:33.547
<i>♪ Come and get it ♪</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:35.465
- Free?
- Food?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.092
- Come and get...
- It?

03:38.343 --> 03:42.556
Hi, you must be those wonderful neighbors
the Croods told us about.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.391
Yep, that Amber.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.436
- Who are you people?
- We're the Broods.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.813
The Croods said we could stay here
while they're away

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
because our names rhyme!
[chuckles]

03:52.399 --> 03:54.317
Aren't the Croods the sweetest?

03:54.401 --> 03:57.237
- Hmm... guess that makes sense.
- Her story checks out.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.322
You <i>can </i> trust a rhyme.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.160
Now come on in and eat, eat, eat.
We have just too much food.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.619
Don't you hate that?

04:04.703 --> 04:06.955
Isn't that just the worst?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.207
[chuckling]

04:12.210 --> 04:14.463
You Broods are so generous.

04:14.546 --> 04:18.048
Grug always gets so mad
when I eat all the food in his cave.

04:21.386 --> 04:25.807
Is this the whole valley?
I don't want to leave anyone out, do I?

04:25.891 --> 04:29.811
Yep, this is everyone.
No one can turn down free food.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.606
Mmm! I'm delicious.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.192
Glad you like it.
We thought if you were busy eating,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.319
you'd be too distracted to stop us.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.780
Too distracted to stop you from...
Oh!

04:39.863 --> 04:40.906
Meatballs.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.825
[chewing and grunting]

04:47.078 --> 04:49.956
I can't believe we had to share our food.

04:50.040 --> 04:55.295
Aww, I know sharing is terrible,
but now we don't have to anymore

04:55.378 --> 04:59.966
because...
<i>♪ Ahhh! Valley is all ours! ♪</i>

05:01.384 --> 05:05.430
Fine, let's get this over with
so we can get back to our vacate-shun.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.772
What? I'm old school.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.566
Oh, no! They've already taken over.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.862
Look, they're wasting all our leaves.
And wearing them.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.865
- Then what do they wipe with?
- [groans]

05:24.449 --> 05:27.869
[Eep] And Blurg's scaring away
all the prey with her joyriding.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.080
Even though she's lousy on the turns.

05:30.163 --> 05:35.085
And Frump is using Dad's fly-at-stuffer
to feed Dub all the smash fruits.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.130
- Looks pretty fun, actually.
- That should be <i>our</i> fun,

05:39.214 --> 05:42.008
because that's my fly-at-stuffer!
[gasps]

05:42.092 --> 05:45.345
That's it!
I know how to get rid of the Broods.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.516
[Eep]
Um, is the fly-at-stuffer involved?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.268
Because we might have a problem.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.562
[gasps] My baby!

05:53.645 --> 05:55.188
[snarling]

05:55.272 --> 05:57.107
Sorry... [chuckles] second baby.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.483
That's it, we're going in.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.237
[grunting]

06:02.862 --> 06:03.863
[chuckles]

06:03.947 --> 06:06.783
[snarling]

06:08.660 --> 06:12.622
[groans] How can something so cute
be so terrifying?

06:12.706 --> 06:13.999
- [Sandy snarling]
- [grunts] Ow!

06:14.082 --> 06:15.959
First baby, I said I was sorry.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.627
Never mind, I know how.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.505
- But how are we gonna get past them?
- Don't worry, Mom.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.050
I think I remember
how Frump controlled them.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.845
Hi, little buddies.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.513
Remember me?

06:29.431 --> 06:30.557
[snarls and roars]

06:30.640 --> 06:33.893
Yep, that seems about
where we left things off.

06:33.977 --> 06:37.564
But unlike everybody else I meet,
I can make you like me.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.358
[snarling and growling]

06:40.442 --> 06:42.110
Whoops! Wrong signal.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.197
[growling]

06:46.281 --> 06:48.450
- [snarling]
- Ohh!

06:48.533 --> 06:50.702
Not that either.
How about this?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.625
- You guys can do that on cue?
- Thunk, focus!

06:59.169 --> 07:00.462
[cooing]

07:00.545 --> 07:01.963
[Thunk sighs] Much better.

07:02.047 --> 07:07.218
[giggles] So cute I could almost forget
you tried to kill me and my family.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.595
Almost.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.267
And now it's forgotten.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.144
Boop! We're in.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.646
Great work, son.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.565
[snarling]

07:21.608 --> 07:23.151
[purring]

07:23.234 --> 07:24.444
Whoops! Sorry, Thunk.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.904
Nah, it's all good.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.740
Now let me slap you on the back again
to congratulate you...

07:28.823 --> 07:30.408
No!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.370
[Grug]
All right, we're in.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.288
Ugga, Gran, go gather some vines.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.040
Eep, you know what to do.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.250
[Thunk]
And I know what our job is.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.586
[giggling and cooing]

07:47.050 --> 07:51.096
I'll show that Dub,
thinks he's so tough and macho.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.056
- Well, so am I!
- [crack]

07:53.139 --> 07:56.393
Well, so is Ugga.
Ugga, little help!

07:56.476 --> 08:00.313
That Grug? Grug, let Amber out!

08:00.397 --> 08:02.857
Amber? What's going on?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.568
Broods bait us inside with food.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.196
Now Amber know what prey feel like.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.616
And Amber no like it!
[sobbing]

08:11.700 --> 08:13.159
Grug, you have to get us out.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.829
It smells like butt and sweat in here.
No offense.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.998
Amber no ashamed of Amber scent.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.959
Uh, hold on. There are a lot of rocks.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.211
Lift with legs, not with back,

08:23.294 --> 08:25.797
but definitely no lift with eye.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.757
Amber learn that hard way.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.135
Don't lift them, roll them.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.554
Don't lift or roll, just believe.

08:33.638 --> 08:37.058
- Uh, on second thought...
- Grug, whatever you're doing,

08:37.142 --> 08:38.768
just do it the opposite way.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.104
There, I saved us. You're welcome.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.082
- [Bud] Don't lift them, roll them.
- [Lerk] Have you tried digging?

08:43.106 --> 08:46.109
- Don't try digging.
- Oh, no!

08:46.192 --> 08:48.945
The Broods, uh, are heading this way.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.989
You can't hear them,
but, um, they are.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.534
- Gotta go!
- [Snoot] What? You can't leave us in here!

08:54.617 --> 08:57.787
The whole valley is in here
and I hate making small talk.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.042
Look, Amber no happy about this,

09:02.125 --> 09:05.420
but at least Grug no leave us
somewhere dangerous.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.673
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

09:08.757 --> 09:12.719
Uh... Amber take back
Amber last statement.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.802

Whoo! Ha ha!

09:22.312 --> 09:24.147

09:25.231 --> 09:26.316
[laughing]

09:26.399 --> 09:28.401
Eep, what are you doing here?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.820
You're supposed to be tyrannaconda food.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.864
Can't keep this girl down.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
[chuckles] Really, he couldn't.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.744
It was like...
[imitates retching]

09:39.370 --> 09:41.831
Well, then, I'm gonna
stuff you back down like...

09:41.915 --> 09:43.583

09:43.666 --> 09:45.919
Oh, yeah?
Then I'll just fight back like...

09:46.002 --> 09:49.005
[grunting]

09:51.508 --> 09:55.220
Enough! I'm dragging you out of this town.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.180
Bye!

10:01.017 --> 10:03.603
Hah! Oh, come on,
at least make an effort.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.193
[growls]

10:13.321 --> 10:15.824
- Hah! Gotcha!
- Um...

10:16.699 --> 10:17.867
[grunts]

10:17.951 --> 10:21.663
Dub says he's not mad at you,
just very disappointed.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.789
[nervous chuckle]

10:23.998 --> 10:25.250
Aaah!

Ohh...

11:14.716 --> 11:16.384
It's better this way.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.101
Everybody look your best.

11:25.184 --> 11:30.940
It's time to be worshipped as heroes
in three... two... [screams]

11:31.024 --> 11:33.568
- Shut it, shut it!
- Why? Why?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.278

Oh, good call.

There, <i>now </i> you can thank us.

11:40.825 --> 11:45.705
Thank you? You left us trapped in your
filthy cave with that deadly beast.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.834
You know I'm defenseless if I can't
use my flight or flight instincts.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.212
- Uh, isn't it fight or...?
- I know what I said.

11:53.296 --> 11:57.133
Everyone, come on, it's not like we knew
the moler bear would come back.

11:57.216 --> 12:01.137
Amber heard Grug excuses
but not hear Grug apology.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.640
For what? You don't even have
a scratch on you.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.017
[wincing and groaning]

12:06.100 --> 12:08.478
Gaah! All right, fine, I admit it,

12:08.561 --> 12:11.356
I left you in the cave
so that we could defeat the Broods

12:11.439 --> 12:13.691
without all of you there to muck it up.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.360
Well, I never!

12:15.443 --> 12:16.861
[both growling]

12:16.945 --> 12:21.074
Friends, just to be clear,
Grug doesn't growl for all of us.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.827
Come on, be honest, Ugga,
the only reason we went on vacate-shun

12:24.911 --> 12:26.955
was to get away from these bigmouths,

12:27.038 --> 12:30.291
always butting in like big...
[growls] butt mouths!

12:30.375 --> 12:31.542
[all gasp]

12:31.626 --> 12:34.671
Say it ain't so, Eep.
Say it ain't so.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.174
No, Lerk, that's how my dad feels, not me.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.636
Lerk, please, I didn't call you a...

12:43.012 --> 12:47.058
[sobs] I just came back to let
you know one more time that...

12:47.141 --> 12:48.810
[bawling]

12:48.893 --> 12:50.144
It hurts!

12:50.228 --> 12:55.108
Look what you Croods did,
making that poor weird girl even weirder.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.779
Amber say if Croods want shun valley,
then valley shun Croods.

12:59.862 --> 13:04.909
Good idea. From now on, we'll treat
the Croods like they don't exist.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.035
Yeah!

13:07.662 --> 13:09.205
I also say yeah.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.710
Ha! You think you can ignore us?
Try this on for size.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.463
<i>♪ I'm Gran, I'm Gran
You have to look at me ♪</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:21.551
- <i>♪ 'Cause I have no shame ♪</i>
- Close your eyes and plug your ears.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.850
- This will show them.
- [screaming]

13:30.643 --> 13:33.479
Well, they're out of our hair.
No need to thank me.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.148
Actually, I take it back, thank me.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.693
Thank you?
You made the whole valley hate us,

13:38.776 --> 13:40.153
even Lerk.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.948
[bawling]

13:44.032 --> 13:47.952
He even made 'em hate me,
and I'm downright adorable.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.204
Grug, I know I say this a lot,

13:50.288 --> 13:52.498
possibly to the point
that it's lost all meaning,

13:52.582 --> 13:56.878
but this time I really mean it:
this is bad!

13:56.961 --> 13:59.213
Family, I can't believe you don't see
how great this is.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.007
We're back in the valley like you wanted,

14:01.090 --> 14:04.594
except now the only person
to bother us is nobody.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.262
[echoing]
nobody...

14:07.346 --> 14:10.975
Ooh, an entire girelephant,
and it's all mine.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.936
Oh, that is,
unless you demand a cut, nobody.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.314
No? Great! [grunts]

14:16.397 --> 14:20.026
Gotcha! You seem bigger
when it's just me out here.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
[grunting and sighs]

14:23.321 --> 14:24.530
Nope, stop.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.074
Bad dinner.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.452
Well, I'm gonna relax
for the rest of the day.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.413
You're not gonna bug me, are you, nobody?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.415
That's what I thought.
[chuckles]

14:34.499 --> 14:36.918
[snarling and growling]

14:37.877 --> 14:40.421
Uh, family, why is Sandy acting crazy?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.049
Sorry, Dad, but there's no other babies
to play with

14:43.132 --> 14:45.009
so Sandy started chasing her own tail.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.012
No other old people either.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.767
[chuckling]
And it was in my nose the whole time!

14:52.850 --> 14:55.686
[laughing]

14:55.770 --> 14:57.480
I don't need them to have fun.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.399
Tell me a joke, nobody.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.985
[chuckles]

15:03.069 --> 15:05.822
Yeah. Guess I had to be there.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.950
I don't know, nobody.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.620
Maybe being part of a community
would make life easier.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.705
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.083
No, you're right, I <i>am </i> talking crazy.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.626
Sure, today was a bit rough,

15:18.709 --> 15:21.921
but there's nothing the Croods
can't overcome all by themselves.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.093
[gasps]

15:27.176 --> 15:28.761
The Broods are here!

15:28.845 --> 15:30.847
- Aaah!
- [panting]

15:30.930 --> 15:33.266
It's those guys from before
whose names I forgot!

15:33.975 --> 15:37.061
That's right, and no more nice Broods.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.564
This time, you're dinner.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.065
For her.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.401
I mean, we are here to eat
all the food in your valley

15:43.484 --> 15:44.944
but it's not our plan to eat people.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.781
Well, no one <i>plans</i> to eat people.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.450
We're not afraid of you.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.244
We beat you once, we can do it again.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.830
[panting] Eat rock.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.125
- [crunching]
- Hmm, I'll be darned.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.919
How come he can eat rocks
and I can't?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.464
Not now, Frump, we are rampaging.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.174
[roaring]

16:06.257 --> 16:08.342
Aaah!

16:08.426 --> 16:12.305
I for one am loving life
without the Croods.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.516
Yep, used to be every day something
big and dangerous happened

16:15.600 --> 16:17.161
and they were always at the center of it.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.480
Yeah, everything always about Croods.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.565
Amber so over it.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.567
[all sighing]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.110
Guys, big problem.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.696
The Broods are back,
and they've got a tyrannaconda.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.323
You guys hear something?

16:30.406 --> 16:33.784
- Amber not hear any Grug Croods.
- No sirree.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.455
This is important!
We... need your help.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.126
The only help you're getting
is help reminding you you're shunned.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.045
- You're shunned!
- No!

16:44.128 --> 16:47.173
No, listen, this affects you too.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.133
I seriously doubt that.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.260
- [snarling]
- [all screaming]

16:51.344 --> 16:54.305
Hi, there. We tried
taking your town peacefully,

16:54.388 --> 16:57.642
stuffing you all in a cramped cave,
[chuckles] but it didn't work, did it?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.143
We can all admit that, right?

16:59.227 --> 17:02.647
So this time, we're stuffing you
in a cramped stomach. Bye, now!

17:03.397 --> 17:05.900
[all screaming]

17:08.611 --> 17:10.738
[roaring]

17:10.820 --> 17:15.159
Well, Womp, you've got one last pick.
Let's make it a good one.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.453
[snarling]

17:19.997 --> 17:21.582
Everyone, this way!

17:29.549 --> 17:33.719
You think that'll slow us down?
I eat buzztles for breakfast.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.472
You do? How do they taste?

17:37.765 --> 17:40.142
Terrible. Really, really terrible.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.020
Okay, Amber have plan.

17:43.104 --> 17:47.108
Plan is, run away and not stop.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.859
We'll just live somewhere else.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.695
What, and give up?

17:50.778 --> 17:52.822
Amber not think of it as "give up."

17:53.447 --> 17:56.701
Actually, yeah. Amber give up.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.369
Let's give up!

17:58.452 --> 18:02.290
Let's give up! Let's give up!

18:02.373 --> 18:05.167
- Let's give up!
- What are we gonna do, Dad?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.546
I think there's only one way out of this.

18:08.629 --> 18:12.383
Of course. Step one,
develop flying powers. Step two...

18:12.466 --> 18:15.219
The only way out of this is together.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.306
What? You're the one
who wanted nothing to do with us.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.850
Not even me, your best friend, Baitsy.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.770
Uh, sure. Part of what you said is true.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.939
I thought I wanted to live alone.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.067
But then I realized
it super-super stinks,

18:30.151 --> 18:32.194
like a butt after eating rotten meat.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.446
Look at the Broods.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.699
They're only out for themselves,
and what did that get them?

18:36.782 --> 18:40.369
Right now, our valley and us
screaming, devoured at their feet.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.624
I mean they're deranged, wasteful jerks
without a home to call their own.

18:44.707 --> 18:48.961
But like my family was trying to
get me to see, we look out for each other.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.547
And that is how we will defeat them.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.550
Ahhh! Valley, Ahhh! Valley!

18:54.634 --> 18:57.637
Ahhh! Valley! Ahhh! Valley!

18:57.720 --> 19:02.767
[all] Ahhh! Valley!
Ahhh! Valley! Ahhh! Valley! Ahhh!

19:03.267 --> 19:05.186
Whoa, whoa, too far, guys.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.856
Um, okay, now, here is the plan.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.108
There they are, charging right at us,

19:11.192 --> 19:13.235
I can only assume to surrender.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.279
Very reasonable, isn't it?

19:15.363 --> 19:18.240
- Whose valley is this?
- [all] Our valley.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.327
- And what's it called?
- [all] Ahhh! Valley.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.703
Ahhh! Valley.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.372
[snarling]

19:24.455 --> 19:27.291
These guys have a funny way
of surrendering.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.126
And... now!

19:30.086 --> 19:31.253
[yelling]

19:36.050 --> 19:37.093
[gasping]

19:37.176 --> 19:38.594
What is this?

19:40.137 --> 19:42.515
- [whimpering]
- Now pin it down.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.563
- [growling]
- [giggling]

19:50.314 --> 19:51.315
That helps, too.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.403
Now, I've got
someone's insides to tickle.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.071
[gasps] Whose?
Please don't be mine.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.909
Gitchie-gitchie-goo.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.203
[snarling laughter]

20:06.747 --> 20:10.793
[groans] Freedom! Disgusting freedom.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.212
[chuckles] I kinda liked it in there.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.172
Wait. Where's...

20:19.927 --> 20:22.722
- Grug, how did you...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.849
I know, Dad. I know.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.851
[snarling]

20:27.601 --> 20:28.769
[whimpers]

20:33.065 --> 20:36.026
Well, you beat us. Guess you're gonna
eat us now, huh? [chuckles]

20:36.110 --> 20:40.948
No. What is wrong with you people?
No one is eating anyone today.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.658
Too late.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.370
Beat it, Broods. This is our home.
[growls]

20:46.454 --> 20:49.623
Very well, but you haven't seen
the last of us.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.960
We shall return
with a vengeance so fierce...

20:53.043 --> 20:55.588
- Frump, come on.
- Sorry.

20:55.671 --> 21:00.217
[groans] Now where was I?
Oh, so much for my threatening goodbye.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.928
- [chuckles]
- [sighs]

21:03.012 --> 21:04.513
Wanna trade weird kids?

21:05.639 --> 21:08.893
No? Yeah, okay. Whatever. Bye.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.312
[cheering and laughing]

21:12.605 --> 21:14.690
[laughing]

21:14.774 --> 21:16.484
I'm so glad we're friends again.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.987
[chortles] Me, too. I was getting tired
of my other friend.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.281
She can be super clingy.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.618
Geez, give me some space!

21:26.911 --> 21:28.913
[munching and slurping]

21:30.414 --> 21:32.917
- [gasps] You came back.
- [cooing]

21:33.501 --> 21:36.253
I almost forgot you broke my heart.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.838
[cooing and purring]

21:37.922 --> 21:39.840
And now it's forgotten.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.050
[hollow thump]

21:41.133 --> 21:45.930
On behalf valley, Amber want thank Grug
and Croods for saving us.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.389
Hear, hear.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.435
Though I do have some suggestions
on how I'd like my life saved next time.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.853
First... [grunts]

21:52.937 --> 21:58.859
Amber also want welcome Croods
back to community. Shun is done!

21:58.943 --> 22:00.569
We're glad to be back.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.990
You know what they say.
There's no place like... uh, this place.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.245
But you heard the Broods.
They'll be back, so we gotta be ready.

22:09.328 --> 22:13.290
Now, it's gonna take a lot of effort,
a lot of thinking, and coordination.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.459
Boy, that sure sounds like a lot of work.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.378
How about just you do it?

22:17.461 --> 22:22.967
Me? No, what I'm saying is,
we all must work together.

22:23.050 --> 22:28.347
Yeah, and Grug lead us and do
all hard work of making us do that.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.808
Wait. Lead you?
No, I'm trying to...

22:30.891 --> 22:31.725
[Amber] It settled.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.687
Grug now leader of Ahhh! Valley.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.940
- [yelling]
- [all cheering]

22:38.023 --> 22:39.567
Grug's the leader?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.944
Nice knowin' ya, valley.
