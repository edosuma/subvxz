WEBVTT

00:05.397 --> 00:08.132
He said that he'd kill me if I came here.

00:08.134 --> 00:11.887
As I looked up, I saw a face
look out the window at me.

00:11.888 --> 00:15.039
This little kid becomes, like, the devil.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.547
You can see its head just...

00:18.548 --> 00:20.648
Hanging.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.683
He lets things in that are
really bad sometimes.

00:25.684 --> 00:28.163
And I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

00:28.164 --> 00:30.928
Like, they could be standing right
next to us right now as we speak.

00:30.929 --> 00:33.149
Oh, yeah.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.163
They're being watched.

00:38.164 --> 00:41.284
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.352 --> 00:43.868
This thing likes death.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.386
I see dead people.

00:45.387 --> 00:46.983
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:46.984 --> 00:48.935
I speak to dead people...

00:48.936 --> 00:50.673
And he's pissed off now.

00:50.674 --> 00:52.038
And they speak to me.

00:52.039 --> 00:53.745
His head was cracked.

00:53.746 --> 00:57.048
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.049 --> 00:58.731
This guy was murdered.

00:58.732 --> 01:00.209
I rely on my partner.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.671
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:01.672 --> 01:03.612
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:03.613 --> 01:06.147
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:06.148 --> 01:09.451
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.452 --> 01:12.153
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.154 --> 01:13.487
Why would you stay here?

01:13.488 --> 01:15.437
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.438 --> 01:17.592
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.593 --> 01:19.060
Until the very end.

01:19.061 --> 01:20.796
Stop it. Stop it.

01:20.797 --> 01:22.764
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

01:22.765 --> 01:25.180
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:25.181 --> 01:26.468
Or time to get out.

01:26.469 --> 01:31.149
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:53.510 --> 01:58.059
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:58.060 --> 02:02.448
I interview witnesses and uncover
dark secrets from the past.

02:02.449 --> 02:05.645
While Amy communicates with the other side.

02:05.646 --> 02:10.985
At the end, we come together
to reveal our findings.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.987
I'm in the small farming
town of Belvidere, Illinois.

02:18.988 --> 02:22.822
It's about an hour and a
half north of Chicago.

02:22.823 --> 02:25.837
We've been called in by a woman named Judy.

02:25.838 --> 02:27.672
She sounds hysterical.

02:27.673 --> 02:31.939
She says weird stuff is happening
and it's tearing her family apart.

02:31.940 --> 02:34.927
She's afraid for her son and her dad.

02:34.928 --> 02:40.828
I'm hoping we can help her out,
because this one sounds bad.

02:50.052 --> 02:55.952
Before Amy arrives, I clear the
area of any leading information.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.856
This location is not only
filled with pictures,

03:00.857 --> 03:04.833
but many unique items that
I have to cover or remove.

03:04.834 --> 03:10.054
Once the house is cleared,
Amy can begin her walk.

03:33.163 --> 03:39.063
So there's, like, some really
significant stuff going on here.

03:41.373 --> 03:43.953
Right in here.

03:44.354 --> 03:47.301
There are, like, these things.

03:47.302 --> 03:50.067
And they're, like...

03:50.068 --> 03:54.148
They're [Bleep ] creepy as [Bleep ].

03:54.338 --> 03:56.798
I saw one...

03:56.826 --> 04:00.186
Walking, um, in the yard.

04:00.222 --> 04:04.602
And it was, like, probably 7 feet tall.

04:06.428 --> 04:11.648
Huge, huge, and... and
they're just all over here.

04:27.007 --> 04:30.652
Judy, you sounded really concerned
on the phone and upset.

04:30.653 --> 04:33.059
- I mean, what's going on?
- Well, we're here at my dad's house.

04:33.060 --> 04:35.748
About ten years ago, my
son and I moved in here,

04:35.749 --> 04:39.977
and ever since we moved
in, we're experiencing...

04:39.978 --> 04:41.896
A lot on this property.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.682
So what kind of things are happening?

04:43.683 --> 04:49.470
We've heard noises, we've seen apparitions,
and we've been physically touched.

04:49.471 --> 04:53.325
As a concerned mom, I wanted to
get my son out of that situation,

04:53.326 --> 04:58.364
so about three years ago, we moved
out of here about 10 miles away.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.448
And it hasn't stopped.

05:00.449 --> 05:03.971
Similar experiences are
happening to us over there,

05:03.972 --> 05:07.095
and I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

05:07.096 --> 05:09.028
Well, Judy, let me ask you,
your father still lives here?

05:09.029 --> 05:10.896
- He does.
- Okay, are you concerned about that?

05:10.897 --> 05:15.397
I am concerned about him and his welfare.

05:20.136 --> 05:24.604
While I was opening, there was,
like, this little boy who was...

05:24.605 --> 05:26.987
Like, 5 or 6 years old maybe.

05:26.988 --> 05:31.182
And blond hair, and he
didn't have any eyes.

05:31.183 --> 05:36.403
He looks, like, Angelic,
but he's, uh, he's dark.

05:36.839 --> 05:39.886
He just had this, like, really...

05:39.887 --> 05:43.367
Bad, bad feeling about him.

05:46.855 --> 05:51.835
What the [Bleep ] is
burrowing under the ground?

05:53.032 --> 05:55.782
It's, like, some creepy...

05:55.783 --> 05:58.303
Thing. Like...

06:00.033 --> 06:05.129
This is not good, and it has something
to do with the little boy and the...

06:05.130 --> 06:07.050
Barn.

06:17.359 --> 06:21.569
It feels weird, creepy being back in here.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.490
Okay.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.621
So do me a favor why
don't you tell me about,

06:26.622 --> 06:28.981
some of the experiences you had
while you were living here?

06:28.982 --> 06:32.171
I've been brushed up against
the back of my legs.

06:32.172 --> 06:34.475
My shirt kind of tugged a little bit.

06:34.476 --> 06:37.030
I've heard whistling.

06:37.031 --> 06:39.030
My name called.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.182
And my ear being tugged on.

06:41.183 --> 06:44.413
Judy, how'd you wind up staying here
so long with all this going on?

06:44.414 --> 06:47.649
You know, Steve, I had to really try
to hold it together for my son.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.850
Well, you're a tough woman.
I give you credit.

06:49.851 --> 06:52.371
I had to be.

07:01.714 --> 07:05.063
There's, like, a lot of hatred there.

07:05.064 --> 07:07.884
With this child...

07:07.885 --> 07:10.206
A lot of hatred.

07:10.207 --> 07:13.086
And, like, he... he... he can interact.
He does.

07:13.087 --> 07:15.203
He can and he does.

07:15.204 --> 07:21.104
I don't really get what he's doing or why
a fricking 5-year-old kid would go crazy.

07:21.999 --> 07:27.279
It's like this little kid
becomes, like, the devil.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.280
So, Judy, why are we here?

07:38.281 --> 07:41.658
Well, I had to feed the animals
for my dad who went out of town,

07:41.659 --> 07:44.623
so my girlfriend came with
me, and as I looked up,

07:44.624 --> 07:47.868
I saw a face look out the window at me,

07:47.869 --> 07:51.562
and I immediately turned around and
ran screaming towards the house.

07:51.563 --> 07:54.294
Okay, now can you describe him
for me as far as his features?

07:54.295 --> 07:59.495
He had a round face, a big nose, and...
his eyes were dark.

07:59.496 --> 08:01.849
If you had to guess an
age, what would you say?

08:01.850 --> 08:05.116
I would say mid-30s or 40s.

08:05.117 --> 08:09.882
The feeling I had in my stomach, it
definitely wasn't anything human.

08:09.883 --> 08:13.903
- This was ghostly looking.
- Okay.

08:24.653 --> 08:26.711
So I hear this voice.

08:26.712 --> 08:31.812
It's really grumbly, like,
gravelly, like, hoarse.

08:32.070 --> 08:35.789
He's like a... like a madman.

08:36.065 --> 08:39.188
I don't know if he thinks
he's possessed, or...

08:39.190 --> 08:40.951
Can you describe him more?

08:40.952 --> 08:43.571
He's probably in his, like, late 30s.

08:43.572 --> 08:46.212
Mm, he's thin.

08:47.062 --> 08:50.148
He's yelling at me. He's a...
very agitated.

08:50.149 --> 08:53.941
- What is he yelling?
- Uh, to get out.

08:53.942 --> 08:58.622
He said that he'd kill me if I came here.

09:03.262 --> 09:06.262
He's like a madman.

09:06.294 --> 09:08.996
- He's yelling at me.
- What is he yelling?

09:08.997 --> 09:11.697
Uh, to get out.

09:11.881 --> 09:15.632
He told me that he'd
kill me if I came here.

09:15.633 --> 09:18.502
And I said, "oh, yeah? Bring it on".

09:18.503 --> 09:24.071
Now he's small and weak and
cowering, and, um, and he's crying.

09:24.072 --> 09:27.972
He's, like, sad, depressed, um...

09:37.933 --> 09:40.956
Frankie, I was talking to
your mom earlier, and, uh,

09:40.957 --> 09:42.981
she basically told me you had
it rough growing up here.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.119
Can you tell me about some
of the experiences you had?

09:45.120 --> 09:48.416
There was one time I was
coming outside of the house,

09:48.417 --> 09:51.541
and I looked up from the
porch at that window,

09:51.542 --> 09:54.782
and I seen this figure,

09:54.860 --> 10:00.071
moving back and forth, you know, trying to
hide, but at the same time watching us.

10:00.072 --> 10:04.072
- Can you describe the guy?
- It was a white outlined figure.

10:04.073 --> 10:07.043
- Did you ever see it again?
- Yes.

10:07.044 --> 10:12.944
A few months later, uh, I seen the same
figure up in the corner over there...

10:15.210 --> 10:18.061
And its head was actually tilted down.

10:18.062 --> 10:23.141
I could see the rope around
its neck and its head just...

10:23.142 --> 10:24.772
Hanging to the side.

10:24.773 --> 10:27.268
So it looked like somebody that was hung.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.189
Yeah.

10:30.550 --> 10:36.450
This male, I guess he kind of
just lost his mind or something.

10:38.022 --> 10:41.354
My head hurts oh, so bad up here.

10:41.355 --> 10:46.338
Bad pain in my head. Bad,
bad pain in my head.

10:46.339 --> 10:49.206
I'm feeling the agony
this man went through.

10:49.207 --> 10:54.607
He is lost, confused, and
completely out of his mind.

10:56.986 --> 10:59.806
He killed himself.

11:04.513 --> 11:07.273
It happened here.

11:08.002 --> 11:11.722
There's something with a rope.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.676
How old were you when
this was all going on?

11:22.677 --> 11:24.863
Around 9, 10 years old.

11:24.864 --> 11:28.621
- How were you sleeping at night?
- I wasn't really sleeping good at all.

11:28.622 --> 11:32.784
For a few years straight,
I had the same dream.

11:32.785 --> 11:36.156
Of this man standing in
the yard watching me.

11:36.157 --> 11:37.666
Describe him to me.

11:37.667 --> 11:41.164
He wasn't that tall, had a
mask on, regular pants.

11:41.165 --> 11:44.995
- What do you mean, had a mask on?
- It was a plain white mask.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.192
Couldn't see his face, nothing.

11:47.193 --> 11:50.406
- How'd you deal with that?
- It bothered me as a kid a lot.

11:50.407 --> 11:53.015
I felt like it was supposed to,
like, mean something to me,

11:53.016 --> 11:55.219
like I was supposed to
understand something.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.084
But I still to this day don't understand.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.005
Okay.

12:06.117 --> 12:09.741
Those things, they're just all over here.

12:09.742 --> 12:12.409
- What did it look like?
- Human-shaped.

12:12.410 --> 12:14.617
Very broad...

12:14.618 --> 12:16.143
Big arms.

12:16.144 --> 12:17.709
Okay.

12:17.710 --> 12:22.167
As I head back to the house, I have to
pass by the 7-foot-tall creatures again.

12:22.168 --> 12:26.861
I don't know why they're here, but
I know they're hiding something.

12:26.862 --> 12:28.916
Like, how many?

12:28.917 --> 12:31.761
Six to ten, maybe.

12:31.762 --> 12:36.562
They were exchanging
masks, like, white masks.

12:37.536 --> 12:40.057
Do you think living people have seen these?

12:40.058 --> 12:42.151
Definitely, I think they've,
like, seen 'em, and,

12:42.152 --> 12:44.417
like, had, like, encounters with them.

12:44.418 --> 12:47.517
And [Bleep ] freaked the [Bleep ] out.

12:47.518 --> 12:51.058
Because they are very scary.

12:57.699 --> 13:00.018
Well, Franco, I spoke with your daughter.

13:00.019 --> 13:03.165
She told me she was getting
physically touched.

13:03.166 --> 13:06.423
Your grandson is pretty much traumatized
by everything that happened here.

13:06.424 --> 13:07.861
He's still traumatized.

13:07.862 --> 13:10.251
I was wondering if you ever
experienced anything here.

13:10.252 --> 13:12.688
Oh, I sure did.

13:12.689 --> 13:18.093
In the dining room, a figure
walked in, and he looked at me,

13:18.094 --> 13:22.101
and like he was surprised that I was here.

13:22.102 --> 13:26.422
And this was a real tall, slender man.

13:26.660 --> 13:30.578
He had this old jacket,
almost like a suit jacket,

13:30.579 --> 13:33.695
but again, from way back when.

13:33.696 --> 13:37.246
- Did you see anything else in this house?
- Just one other time.

13:37.247 --> 13:39.867
One night I was in here watching TV,

13:39.868 --> 13:44.832
and right to the right on the floor,
I see this little white cloud.

13:44.833 --> 13:49.986
And then it started moving, and I could
see the shape of a head and little arms.

13:49.987 --> 13:50.985
You're kidding.

13:50.986 --> 13:56.683
Almost like a premature baby.
It was slowly moving around.

13:56.684 --> 13:58.544
Wow.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.927
The little boy thing, whatever
the [Bleep ] it is...

14:07.928 --> 14:11.463
He likes really bad [Bleep ].

14:11.464 --> 14:16.504
He lets things in that are
really bad sometimes.

14:18.411 --> 14:23.751
But he seems too [Bleep ]
evil to be a 5-year-old.

14:24.589 --> 14:29.509
Yeah, he's a liar. I
think he's tricking me.

14:31.355 --> 14:33.454
I think he's a liar.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.755
I don't like him, okay?

14:45.214 --> 14:47.760
Yeah, that kind of scared me a little bit.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.281
What happened?

14:51.472 --> 14:53.713
It's not a real kid.

14:53.714 --> 14:57.114
It's something really bad.

14:57.115 --> 14:58.430
Like what?

14:58.431 --> 15:02.691
Demons will pretend to be dead people.

15:10.854 --> 15:12.416
What are you thinking?

15:12.417 --> 15:15.897
That it's not a real kid.

15:18.014 --> 15:23.234
I think that the burrowing
monster is this child...

15:24.629 --> 15:30.529
And I think that it'll torment
the people who are living here.

15:32.478 --> 15:37.105
Do you know if, uh,
people here see this boy?

15:37.106 --> 15:43.006
I think so, but I don't think they
necessarily see him like I do.

15:47.885 --> 15:51.188
Yeah, that kind of scared me a little bit.

15:51.189 --> 15:54.270
So you're saying that he might
project himself differently to,

15:54.271 --> 15:57.559
different people to influence
their perception of him?

15:57.560 --> 15:58.795
Yes.

15:58.796 --> 16:01.273
Do you know if they have
any kind of interaction?

16:01.274 --> 16:07.174
He makes them feel sick or he makes them
hurt or something along those lines.

16:07.311 --> 16:12.531
It feels like he can easily
travel back and forth.

16:17.282 --> 16:19.440
With all the activity in this house,

16:19.441 --> 16:23.155
I need to know about the previous owners.

16:23.156 --> 16:29.056
So I went to the local library to see
what I can uncover in their records.

16:33.665 --> 16:35.594
Digging through the archives,

16:35.595 --> 16:38.426
I was shocked to discover that
two brothers committed suicide,

16:38.427 --> 16:42.387
at the location I'm investigating.

16:42.485 --> 16:45.868
The newspaper articles
didn't have many details.

16:45.869 --> 16:48.149
So I'm headed over to meet
with a retired Belvidere cop,

16:48.150 --> 16:53.130
who says he's got information
to help my case.

16:58.270 --> 17:00.656
What were you able to find
out about these suicides?

17:00.657 --> 17:03.037
Well, actually, Steve, this was
one of the most interesting

17:03.038 --> 17:05.461
cases I've ever looked into.

17:05.462 --> 17:10.862
Back in 1939, Thomas Smith,
a 24-year-old young man,

17:10.866 --> 17:16.132
was quite despondent, and he ended up
having an argument with his girlfriend.

17:16.133 --> 17:20.082
And later that evening, he
went out into the kitchen,

17:20.083 --> 17:23.660
and took a.22 caliber pistol.

17:23.661 --> 17:26.747
And shot himself in the heart.

17:26.748 --> 17:32.388
I was able to come up with the
actual death certificate.

17:34.226 --> 17:36.592
Now what about the second suicide?

17:36.593 --> 17:39.173
Well, in 1961,

17:39.343 --> 17:42.225
Thomas' brother Raymond,

17:42.226 --> 17:46.161
also committed suicide
using the exact same gun,

17:46.162 --> 17:50.126
that Thomas had shot himself
with 20 years earlier.

17:50.127 --> 17:55.827
And I also have a copy of the
Medical Examiner's report.

17:56.183 --> 18:01.151
He lived alone with his mother,
had no girlfriends, wasn't sick.

18:01.152 --> 18:07.052
There was really no indication as to
why he would want to commit suicide.

18:12.483 --> 18:15.963
This demon says he controls
the house and everyone in it.

18:15.964 --> 18:20.944
And I get the feeling
he's about to prove it.

18:24.376 --> 18:26.958
I think it's, uh, self-inflicted.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.285
What do you mean?

18:28.286 --> 18:30.435
I saw...

18:30.436 --> 18:34.216
A noose hanging from the beams.

18:40.313 --> 18:44.094
Raymond takes the gun
that his brother used.

18:44.095 --> 18:48.289
He shoots himself in the same
manner, but he doesn't die.

18:48.290 --> 18:51.429
So he looks up and sees this rope,

18:51.430 --> 18:55.739
decides to put it around his
neck, and hang himself.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.158
Have you ever heard of anything like that?

18:57.159 --> 19:03.059
No. Of the 23 years, I-I never
had anything like this happen.

19:06.087 --> 19:10.686
He says he was trying to find a way
out for a long time, long time.

19:10.687 --> 19:16.027
I guess he kind of just
lost his mind or something.

19:18.698 --> 19:21.905
There's a lot of blood.

19:21.906 --> 19:25.268
I hear somebody yelling.
I hear a male yelling.

19:25.269 --> 19:30.609
I hear a gunshot, and there's
the pain in my head.

19:33.445 --> 19:35.862
He doesn't like this. He
doesn't like that we're up...

19:35.863 --> 19:38.661
That we're in his... his domain.

19:38.662 --> 19:41.212
Who's "he" that you're talking about?

19:41.213 --> 19:44.693
The man who killed himself.

19:50.927 --> 19:54.496
After Bill filled me in on
the details of the suicides.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.301
Clearly I need to find out a lot
more about the Smith family,

19:57.302 --> 20:00.295
who owned the property I'm investigating.

20:00.296 --> 20:06.196
I've contacted a local historian who
tells me their story is a tragedy.

20:10.682 --> 20:13.838
The Smith family settled here about 1899.

20:13.839 --> 20:17.296
Charles Smith was the father. He
settled the area, had 13 children.

20:17.297 --> 20:20.619
And then his oldest son
Edward took it over.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.787
Okay.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.053
Edward was married to a woman named Asika.

20:24.054 --> 20:29.075
And he had ten children, and of those,
six of them died on the property.

20:29.076 --> 20:31.462
Six? So it's more than
just the two suicides.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.195
There were four children that died.

20:33.196 --> 20:36.928
We had one girl died at the age
of 6 from cancer of the arm.

20:36.929 --> 20:40.406
Another girl died from
pneumonia at the age of 4.

20:40.407 --> 20:44.385
The third girl died at the age
of 9 months from bronchitis.

20:44.386 --> 20:49.666
And finally, they had a
baby boy who was stillborn.

20:50.391 --> 20:53.802
Do you know why he killed himself?

20:53.803 --> 20:56.383
Sad, depressed.

20:59.199 --> 21:00.881
I think a lot of his...

21:00.882 --> 21:05.520
His, uh, family or friends
or both were killed.

21:05.521 --> 21:07.684
Can you tell how they were killed?

21:07.685 --> 21:12.065
It's like, everybody's eating and
it's great and it's evening, and...

21:12.066 --> 21:15.544
Something bad, and then they're dead.
Their all bodies are...

21:15.545 --> 21:19.750
They're all messed up. They are all bloody.

21:19.751 --> 21:24.251
Everybody put in a hole or some [Bleep ].

21:27.692 --> 21:31.892
And he's, uh, he's all [Bleep ] up.

21:46.202 --> 21:49.779
I need to find out more about the Smith
family and what they went through.

21:49.780 --> 21:54.021
So I've managed to track down a descendant
of the two brothers who killed themselves.

21:54.022 --> 21:59.922
He says he's willing to talk to me about a
very dark chapter in his family's history.

22:05.994 --> 22:08.492
Trevor, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate it.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.706
You know I'm investigating Thomas,

22:10.707 --> 22:14.448
and Raymond's suicides on the
property that your family owned.

22:14.449 --> 22:17.767
What is your relationship
with Raymond and Thomas?

22:17.768 --> 22:22.928
My grandpa is Raymond and
Thomas' youngest brother.

22:23.442 --> 22:28.243
What can you tell me about
their father, Ed Sr.?

22:28.244 --> 22:31.280
This is my great-grandfather.

22:31.281 --> 22:34.883
I heard he was a hardworking kind of man.

22:34.884 --> 22:39.209
They put in long-hour days, you know?
12, 13, 14 hours.

22:39.210 --> 22:43.219
The winters were harsh,
but he enjoyed doing it.

22:43.220 --> 22:48.620
Because they knew they had
to provide for the family.

22:48.995 --> 22:53.594
There's something about
this old man, grandpa.

22:53.595 --> 22:57.015
Like, an Ed, Eddie, Edgar.

22:57.088 --> 23:00.402
He's a farmer. Literally
the image of a farmer...

23:00.403 --> 23:04.783
Overalls, cut-off sleeves, big rosy guy.

23:05.815 --> 23:08.063
Anyways, he died.

23:08.064 --> 23:11.484
He comes here still. Uh...

23:13.160 --> 23:16.775
I got to ask you a question... how did
these suicides affect your family?

23:16.776 --> 23:21.309
When Thomas committed suicide, they were
sad and they were heartbroken, but...

23:21.310 --> 23:25.331
They kind of saw it happening since
him and his girlfriend broke up.

23:25.332 --> 23:29.517
But when Ray died, nobody
was expecting that.

23:29.518 --> 23:31.408
This is Raymond.

23:31.409 --> 23:35.908
All in all, the family was upset,
but it kind of erased the family.

23:35.909 --> 23:39.721
You know, kind of made them
just go all their own ways.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.880
Trevor, I read in an article that
your great-grandmother Asika,

23:42.881 --> 23:46.969
basically had no emotion or no
reaction when they found Raymond.

23:46.970 --> 23:51.021
I believe myself that she was
more shell-shocked or just,

23:51.022 --> 23:53.711
all in all just shocked about it.

23:53.712 --> 23:57.933
That was her, and then this
is after Raymond passed away.

23:57.934 --> 24:02.929
Within two years, three years after
Ray died, Asika passed away.

24:02.930 --> 24:06.404
She, uh, came down with an illness,

24:06.405 --> 24:09.610
and then she went anorexic
and she was 63 pounds.

24:09.611 --> 24:12.080
So she took it probably the hardest.

24:12.081 --> 24:14.287
She committed suicide, too, in a sense.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.087
I mean, you know, she just
pretty much quite eating,

24:17.088 --> 24:22.788
went into a bad depression,
and just took her from there.

24:23.634 --> 24:26.606
Some woman, her heart's broken.

24:26.607 --> 24:29.077
Nobody's gonna do anything
to make it right,

24:29.078 --> 24:32.138
and she is not okay.

24:32.396 --> 24:35.276
About any of this.

24:35.939 --> 24:39.074
So she keeps skipping through time.

24:39.075 --> 24:43.321
So I see her younger. She's happy.
It's summer.

24:43.322 --> 24:47.522
All good things, and then she's old.

24:50.173 --> 24:52.443
She's so sad.

24:52.444 --> 24:54.529
And lost.

24:54.530 --> 24:55.684
Why is she sad?

24:55.685 --> 25:00.005
She feels, like, a huge sense of loss.

25:00.406 --> 25:03.134
Do you know if she was here on
this property when she was living?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.995
Yes.

25:10.573 --> 25:13.918
A lot of bizarre activity has
taken place on Franco's property.

25:13.919 --> 25:17.812
And Judy's worried that it's
followed her to her new home.

25:17.813 --> 25:20.434
As much as I don't like breaking the rules.

25:20.435 --> 25:24.293
I need to meet with Amy and
have her walk Judy's house.

25:24.294 --> 25:27.474
Okay, I'll set it up.

25:45.909 --> 25:50.829
There's stuff that comes
inside from out here.

25:50.837 --> 25:53.117
There's...

25:54.086 --> 25:55.283
People.

25:55.284 --> 25:57.601
They've been called.

25:57.602 --> 26:03.182
They've been asked to come
into the back of the house.

26:08.032 --> 26:09.813
What do you mean, they've
been asked to come?

26:09.814 --> 26:11.060
They've been invited.

26:11.061 --> 26:16.961
So I'm assuming one of the owners
or both invited them to come here.

26:17.608 --> 26:21.584
A lot of dead people are being
drawn to this location.

26:21.585 --> 26:25.719
Either the people who live here are
trying to communicate with them.

26:25.720 --> 26:30.491
Or they have abilities that are
unintentionally attracting the dead.

26:30.492 --> 26:32.482
I feel like there are
two people that are...

26:32.483 --> 26:37.003
Have been having experiences. And
there's so much, like, tr...

26:37.004 --> 26:41.012
Like, these voices that are in
the air constantly talking.

26:41.013 --> 26:46.043
My body doesn't feel comfortable here.
It's like, you know...

26:46.044 --> 26:48.864
This annoying hum.

26:49.634 --> 26:52.330
Is what's going on dangerous for them?

26:52.331 --> 26:55.272
Yeah, open invitation.

26:55.273 --> 26:59.353
They've had nasty [Bleep ] come in.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.008
During my walk, I
encountered many entities.

27:08.009 --> 27:11.566
I wanted to sketch the
two I saw most clearly.

27:11.567 --> 27:14.115
First, the old woman.

27:14.116 --> 27:18.796
She's probably in her 80s, very round face.

27:18.802 --> 27:23.646
Very, very thin hair going
down to about here.

27:23.647 --> 27:29.547
Her eyes are actually rather large, round,
and kind of bulbous, like, protruding.

27:29.558 --> 27:33.027
Next, I describe the 7-foot-tall entity.

27:33.028 --> 27:36.748
It was wearing a mask, so
it has a very oval head.

27:36.749 --> 27:42.029
The eyes on the mask are...
are very almond-shaped.

27:42.305 --> 27:44.793
It has a stripe.

27:44.794 --> 27:49.234
It goes right across the eyes like that.

27:49.648 --> 27:52.434
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:52.435 --> 27:54.295
Yes.

28:16.275 --> 28:19.446
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

28:19.447 --> 28:25.347
We're ready to reveal our findings to the
clients and each other for the first time.

28:29.093 --> 28:33.245
Amy, I want to introduce you
to three generations here.

28:33.246 --> 28:35.194
Franco lives here.

28:35.195 --> 28:37.684
Judy and Frankie did live here.

28:37.685 --> 28:42.369
And things got so bad for the three of them
that Judy and Frankie actually moved out.

28:42.370 --> 28:46.312
Big concern here is, is it
safe for Franco to stay.

28:46.313 --> 28:50.254
And have Judy and Frankie taken
something back to where they live now,

28:50.255 --> 28:51.786
and are they gonna be okay?

28:51.787 --> 28:57.487
So with that, Amy will start
and tell us about her walk.

29:01.960 --> 29:06.377
The first thing that I
got was this little...

29:06.378 --> 29:09.150
Creature, maybe about this tall.

29:09.151 --> 29:12.004
And, um, it would burrow into the ground.

29:12.005 --> 29:14.509
And it felt very, very negative.

29:14.510 --> 29:19.857
And then I saw these creature
things out in the yard.

29:19.858 --> 29:24.935
They were, like, 7 feet tall,
abnormally long arms, muscular.

29:24.936 --> 29:29.856
They were wearing two
different types of masks.

29:31.690 --> 29:36.394
When I was a little kid, I would
go to bed, uh, and in the dream,

29:36.395 --> 29:40.093
I would be looking out my
second-floor window into the yard.

29:40.094 --> 29:44.792
And I would see just one man standing
there wouldn't do nothing, wouldn't move.

29:44.793 --> 29:49.325
He had a mask on, and I would
have that dream constantly.

29:49.326 --> 29:52.060
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:52.061 --> 29:54.741
Okay, all right, I drew it.

29:54.742 --> 29:58.762
You did a sketch of what you saw.

30:02.564 --> 30:04.424
Wow.

30:14.862 --> 30:18.134
Well, I think I'd be afraid if I saw
that in the middle of the night, too.

30:18.135 --> 30:20.775
Yeah, that's...

30:20.855 --> 30:23.495
Looks like him.

30:24.503 --> 30:26.903
It's scary.

30:29.325 --> 30:32.961
Are they, like, guardians or something?

30:32.962 --> 30:35.902
Not in a good way.

30:37.751 --> 30:43.091
I wouldn't know why you
would call that a guardian.

30:43.815 --> 30:45.466
Okay, Amy, what else did you see?

30:45.467 --> 30:50.394
When I came in here, I saw
this, uh, really nice guy.

30:50.395 --> 30:52.129
Uh, he's a farmer.

30:52.130 --> 30:55.044
Um, he lived here. I know he died here.

30:55.045 --> 31:00.075
He comes in the barn a lot, but he's all
around, and his name was Ed or Eddie.

31:00.076 --> 31:02.139
You're kidding.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.933
- Ed or Eddie?
- Mm-hmm.

31:04.934 --> 31:07.967
Do me a favor before I move
on, just tell her about...

31:07.968 --> 31:11.081
Franco, if you can, the
guy you saw in the house.

31:11.082 --> 31:15.728
The guy that I saw in the
house was very tall, lean.

31:15.729 --> 31:17.415
Uh...

31:17.416 --> 31:19.540
Very old-fashionedly dressed.

31:19.541 --> 31:22.540
The original settler on this land
was a second-generation farmer,

31:22.541 --> 31:24.767
by the name of Eddie Smith, Edward Smith.

31:24.768 --> 31:28.748
And he, uh, farmed this
land for probably 70 years.

31:28.749 --> 31:31.607
He was a nice guy, apparently.
He was... ten children.

31:31.608 --> 31:33.528
Jeez.

31:37.030 --> 31:39.173
Now that looks more like what I seen.

31:39.174 --> 31:41.454
Is that...

31:42.524 --> 31:46.112
He looked just like that. I
seen him with my own eyes.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.546
- Do you think this could have been him?
- I mean, yeah.

31:48.547 --> 31:51.247
It's incredible.

31:52.884 --> 31:56.211
The other person that I saw
was right here in this barn.

31:56.212 --> 31:58.737
He, like, was suicidal.

31:58.738 --> 32:00.849
He just kind of snapped.

32:00.850 --> 32:04.583
I saw an old pistol, and
then I heard a gunshot.

32:04.584 --> 32:10.464
But I'm looking at these, and
I'm like, "he hung himself".

32:12.134 --> 32:15.262
She almost nailed this down to 100%.

32:15.263 --> 32:20.783
His son Raymond in 1961
committed suicide in this barn.

32:21.219 --> 32:22.497
This is Raymond.

32:22.498 --> 32:27.824
He committed suicide by shooting himself
in the chest with an old pistol.

32:27.825 --> 32:29.534
Oh, my God.

32:29.535 --> 32:33.366
- Apparently he didn't die right away...
- Oh, my God.

32:33.367 --> 32:36.769
So he decided that he
wasn't dying fast enough.

32:36.770 --> 32:38.881
He took a rope and then hung himself.

32:38.882 --> 32:42.724
I know ten people personally
that have committed suicide.

32:42.725 --> 32:45.694
And nine out of those ten,
I could see it coming.

32:45.695 --> 32:49.473
They didn't see that with this guy.
They did not see it coming at all.

32:49.474 --> 32:53.554
So it was pretty much a big shock.

32:56.138 --> 32:58.826
You look upset, Judy.

32:58.827 --> 33:01.966
Tell Amy what you saw...

33:01.967 --> 33:04.247
That time.

33:04.966 --> 33:06.810
My dad went out of town and I had...

33:06.811 --> 33:10.491
He asked me to come here one evening
to take care of the animals.

33:10.492 --> 33:14.424
I looked up, and I saw a guy look
like this out the window at me,

33:14.425 --> 33:17.444
and I just turned around and
ran for the house screaming.

33:17.445 --> 33:22.263
I don't think I've ever been
so petrified in my life.

33:22.264 --> 33:25.446
Same thing kind of along the
lines with my mother...

33:25.447 --> 33:27.213
I look up at the barn.

33:27.214 --> 33:32.080
Just some reason made me look, you
know, and I notice this white figure

33:32.081 --> 33:35.738
peeking its head through the window,
but at the same time trying to hide.

33:35.739 --> 33:36.778
It was the same window.

33:36.779 --> 33:38.262
- The same window.
- Okay.

33:38.263 --> 33:44.023
Didn't want us to know he was
there, but he was peeking.

33:44.787 --> 33:48.672
Well, there's a little bit of a kicker to
the whole story about the Smith family.

33:48.673 --> 33:50.906
Raymond here had an older brother,

33:50.907 --> 33:55.763
that committed suicide in the kitchen
of your house, with the same exact gun

33:55.764 --> 33:57.899
- that he killed himself with.
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

33:57.900 --> 34:00.258
The same.22 caliber gun.

34:00.259 --> 34:02.618
He shot himself in the chest area.

34:02.619 --> 34:05.793
The same exact way he did in
the kitchen of your house.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.654
Hmm.

34:08.010 --> 34:11.987
I saw friends and family off to the side.

34:11.989 --> 34:14.520
Um... and then I saw them all dead.

34:14.521 --> 34:16.264
Really? How many?

34:16.266 --> 34:18.183
Five or six.

34:18.184 --> 34:20.650
The story of the Smith
family is pretty tragic.

34:20.652 --> 34:24.907
He had ten kids. Six of
'em died, two to suicide.

34:24.908 --> 34:28.330
He also had a 6-year-old daughter
who died of cancer of the arm...

34:28.331 --> 34:29.523
Oh, my gosh.

34:29.524 --> 34:33.224
Yeah, he had a 5-year-old
daughter died of pneumonia.

34:33.225 --> 34:37.547
He had a 9-month-old
daughter died of bronchitis.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.675
And then he had a son that was stillborn.

34:40.676 --> 34:44.063
That explains what I saw, probably.

34:44.065 --> 34:48.020
I was in my living room one
night, and I see this little...

34:48.021 --> 34:52.612
White ball on the floor, and you could
tell it was, like, a preemie baby.

34:52.614 --> 34:55.223
- Mm.
- Just kind of arms and feet moving.

34:55.224 --> 35:00.984
You could tell the shape of a
baby, but not fully formed.

35:05.007 --> 35:06.882
So what else did you see?

35:06.883 --> 35:12.174
Outside over here I met, um, an older
lady, and she was really heartbroken.

35:12.175 --> 35:14.523
And she was, like, old.

35:14.524 --> 35:19.111
She's just so, uh, sad and lost that, um,

35:19.112 --> 35:21.668
you know, nothing can make it better.

35:21.669 --> 35:23.222
Who would that sound like?

35:23.223 --> 35:24.832
- The mom, right?
- Right.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.234
Ed Sr.'s wife was named Asika.

35:27.235 --> 35:31.680
After Raymond killed himself, she
just went into a downward spiral.

35:31.681 --> 35:35.383
And she wound up dying three years later.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.265
I got a photo of her.

35:37.266 --> 35:40.201
She was 63 pounds when she died.

35:40.202 --> 35:42.902
Oh, my goodness.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.426
So I sketched the sad woman.

35:45.427 --> 35:48.378
- The woman you saw?
- Mm-hmm.

35:48.379 --> 35:51.079
She's just sad.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.469
Wow.

35:54.470 --> 35:58.370
You guys tell me what you think.

36:18.267 --> 36:22.707
So I sketched the sad woman that I saw.

36:28.744 --> 36:32.485
You guys tell me what you think.

36:32.486 --> 36:34.346
Wow.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.629
Yeah, I'd call that her.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.672
Mm-hmm.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.766
- Yeah, that looks like the mouth exactly.
- Yeah.

36:51.767 --> 36:55.727
Definitely in the mouth, the nose.

36:56.175 --> 37:00.800
- You do think this is her.
- Yeah, it's very possible.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.555
So they're still here?

37:02.556 --> 37:05.745
Like, they could be standing right
next to us right now as we speak?

37:05.746 --> 37:07.606
Yes.

37:14.559 --> 37:19.167
The other thing that I saw when I
went into the house was a child.

37:19.168 --> 37:21.133
A 5-year-old little boy.

37:21.134 --> 37:25.029
He was very Angelic-looking,
except he didn't have any eyes,

37:25.030 --> 37:28.120
and there were, like, this
light coming out of his eyes.

37:28.121 --> 37:31.277
His main area is the house,
but he can go anywhere.

37:31.278 --> 37:34.638
He's very, very powerful.

37:36.770 --> 37:41.104
Initially he showed me, like,
this sweet little boy.

37:41.105 --> 37:43.482
But it... it wasn't real.

37:43.483 --> 37:46.506
It was to gain my sympathy, to trick me.

37:46.507 --> 37:50.791
And then when I chased him out of
the barn, he turned into the...

37:50.792 --> 37:54.212
That little creature thing.

37:55.052 --> 38:00.692
It dove into the ground and
was burrowing in the ground.

38:01.684 --> 38:05.092
The child is not a child.

38:05.093 --> 38:08.459
It's some kind of demonic presence.

38:08.460 --> 38:14.280
And what it did to this family
was it caused two suicides.

38:14.430 --> 38:17.985
It probably influenced them to do it.

38:17.986 --> 38:21.324
And probably killed the girls...

38:21.325 --> 38:25.814
The children, because they're weak, and...

38:25.815 --> 38:28.676
Completely destroyed the family.

38:28.677 --> 38:31.576
You were concerned about Frankie because
you feel like you were losing him,

38:31.577 --> 38:33.231
at some point?

38:33.232 --> 38:37.559
Yeah, I mean, he was getting
to the point where...

38:37.560 --> 38:40.920
You know, like, nothing mattered and...

38:40.921 --> 38:43.869
Just became distant, you know?

38:43.870 --> 38:47.830
And I don't want that to happen.

38:54.446 --> 38:58.798
Well, there's obviously
a lot going on here.

38:58.799 --> 39:00.830
Two biggest questions...

39:00.831 --> 39:03.679
Is it safe for Franco at this house,

39:03.680 --> 39:07.790
and did this thing follow you two guys to
your new home, and are you safe there?

39:07.791 --> 39:13.691
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy,
and hopefully, she will have an answer.

39:16.844 --> 39:20.398
In your house, you guys are getting
an influx of random people,

39:20.399 --> 39:24.390
and things coming in the back
door and the back window.

39:24.391 --> 39:30.224
But the good news is that your
house is a lot easier to contain.

39:30.225 --> 39:34.044
Um, all you need to do
is bring in a holy man.

39:34.045 --> 39:37.067
Who will have a blessing
done and a sealing done.

39:37.068 --> 39:38.293
Okay.

39:38.294 --> 39:42.389
But this property, your situation
is a little bit different.

39:42.390 --> 39:44.883
You know, this thing's
been here for a long time.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.849
It can affect people.

39:46.850 --> 39:51.590
So you really need to not only get the
blessing and get the sealing done,

39:51.591 --> 39:56.711
but also you need to bring in a Shaman
who will deal with the Elementals.

39:56.712 --> 40:00.119
And seal up the property so that the...

40:00.120 --> 40:04.020
Demonic thing can't get back in.

40:04.811 --> 40:07.547
Elementals are entities created by nature.

40:07.548 --> 40:10.437
The creature tormenting
this family never lived.

40:10.438 --> 40:14.534
So a priest wouldn't be able to
get rid of it, only a Shaman.

40:14.535 --> 40:18.460
My concern is that if you don't take
care of this, what could happen?

40:18.461 --> 40:22.040
Ooh, it'd be bad. It'll continue.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.080
So what... what do they do first?

40:24.081 --> 40:26.767
It'd be great if you could do it
all at the same time, really.

40:26.768 --> 40:31.429
Like, if you could have the Shaman here
and have the priest or the holy man.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.064
That would be great.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.006
You have that look on your face
like you don't believe her.

40:36.007 --> 40:41.907
No, I've heard stories before actually
from my friend, uh, that is half Indian.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.902
How this one family had evil spirits
and they called one of these shamans,

40:45.903 --> 40:49.795
and got rid of all those evil
spirits that were in the house.

40:49.796 --> 40:51.628
Okay, so you're gonna take
Amy's advice and do this?

40:51.629 --> 40:52.819
Yes.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.157
In your opinion,

40:54.158 --> 40:57.819
do you think once they take care of
all this that things will get better?

40:57.820 --> 41:02.579
I think that their home environment
will be much better, you know?

41:02.580 --> 41:05.510
The chaos will subside.

41:05.511 --> 41:08.271
I don't want to see what
happened to this family...

41:08.272 --> 41:11.268
God forbid. Happen to your family.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.736
That's why I want you to promise that
you'll at least do what you have to do,

41:14.737 --> 41:17.502
and I can walk out of here
tonight feeling better.

41:17.503 --> 41:19.607
You can guarantee I will be doing that.

41:19.608 --> 41:21.794
Okay, what about you?

41:21.795 --> 41:25.010
Yeah. I'm definitely gonna
take up what she said.

41:25.011 --> 41:26.931
Okay.

41:27.100 --> 41:31.224
I witnessed exactly what Frankie
saw, and the sketch proves it.

41:31.225 --> 41:34.029
But that can be hard for
a young man to accept.

41:34.030 --> 41:36.307
I just hope this family
keeps their promise,

41:36.308 --> 41:41.350
because I believe their
lives could depend on it.
