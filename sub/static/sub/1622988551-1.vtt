WEBVTT

03:09.487 --> 03:13.526
See?
I didn't take to long after all.

03:13.558 --> 03:16.728
Well, I guess you didn
t, so we go now?

03:16.762 --> 03:20.233
Yes, I have given you some
pocket money, right?

03:20.265 --> 03:22.300
Now, remember,
stay out of trouble

03:22.334 --> 03:24.236
or you are coming back
this weekend.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.640
Come home again?
Must I come home every weekend?

03:27.673 --> 03:30.543
This is a college and we have
accommodation remember?

03:30.575 --> 03:34.579
Edwin, I know you are a college
student, okay? but I made a

03:34.612 --> 03:36.649
promise to my friend
Regina that I will look after

03:36.681 --> 03:39.384
you and I intend to fulfill
that promise no matter

03:39.418 --> 03:41.020
how many times
I have failed her in the past.

03:41.052 --> 03:42.621
But Miss Zaya-

03:42.655 --> 03:45.491
No buts, okay? You re coming
home this weekend and

03:45.524 --> 03:47.259
every weekend.

03:49.294 --> 03:50.629
The
country is not very safe yet.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.398
But the war is over.

03:52.431 --> 03:55.635
Yes, the war is over.
But Watz people,

03:55.668 --> 03:59.772
Watz Republic is not really free
yet. The people are still caged

03:59.805 --> 04:01.774
in their minds, okay?

04:01.806 --> 04:05.510
Everything thing takes time and
so we take precaution.

04:06.778 --> 04:08.814
Okay?

04:16.654 --> 04:20.825
Ah, Bloody car,
what a time to pack up.

04:20.858 --> 04:24.363
You Miss Zaya, need a new car.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.667
Bossangoa needs a new airport,
do they have it? No!

04:27.699 --> 04:30.468
They need new shopping malls,
New hospitals, new roads.

04:30.502 --> 04:33.805
Do they have it?
No Edwin, everything takes time.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.675
Time and money are very scarce
commodities and this

04:36.709 --> 04:39.745
lady right here, still has some
mileage in her.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.433
No...

05:28.726 --> 05:31.730
Uh, car problem again Miss Zaya?

05:40.773 --> 05:43.710
Car problem again Mr Assanbe.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.748
Well, I may not be able to help
with your car, but perhaps

05:48.781 --> 05:52.384
I can help by giving you a ride
in my car, this is okay?

05:52.418 --> 05:56.756
Yes, Thank you very much. Edwin
come, Mr Assanbe, has been kind

05:56.788 --> 05:59.791
enough to give us a ride.
Come, let s go.

06:12.971 --> 06:13.973
Thank you.

06:14.005 --> 06:16.842
You're welcome.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.032
The London Transport map.

07:13.064 --> 07:16.968
What? I'm sorry Sir, I didn't
see you were there,

07:17.002 --> 07:19.472
I have finished the collations
and sorted all the items ready

07:19.504 --> 07:21.706
for the Monday morning meeting
as requested.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.609
It s alright, have a seat.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.846
Actually I was
coming by to thank you Zaya.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.681
I don't know what I
would have done without the help

07:28.713 --> 07:30.815
from a brilliant assistant like
yourself, I appreciate it.

07:30.848 --> 07:34.052
You can take a break now, the
cook is making something to eat.

07:34.086 --> 07:37.021
It s the least I can do for
taking away your precious

07:37.055 --> 07:39.725
weekend to help
me sort things out.

07:39.757 --> 07:42.627
Thank you Sir,
It s no problem at all.

07:47.632 --> 07:50.802
I see you like
my unconventional taste in art.

07:50.836 --> 07:55.508
It s very, very nice,
the names, very original

07:56.040 --> 07:58.677
Yes, I suppose they are.

07:59.310 --> 08:02.548
Who were the seven sisters, Mr
Hammersmith?

08:02.581 --> 08:07.086
The seven sisters? Why the
interest?

08:07.653 --> 08:12.825
Well, as a child my dad, mum and
I, We lived at Enfield Island

08:12.858 --> 08:17.028
Village in Enfield Lock for
about 24 months during his post

08:17.062 --> 08:21.033
graduate studies in England. On
the weekends my father would

08:21.065 --> 08:24.869
take me shopping, or to watch a
movie but, because of the

08:24.903 --> 08:26.972
distance,
we used to take the train.

08:27.004 --> 08:30.843
So, we would take the Victoria
Line and National rail and two

08:30.875 --> 08:34.112
names stuck in my head for two
completely different reasons.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.982
Tottenham Hale and Seven
Sisters.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.884
Interesting story, go on.

08:39.918 --> 08:43.889
Okay, well, Tottenham Hale
because, that was when we

08:43.922 --> 08:45.891
would switch before crossing
over to the National rail. So,

08:45.923 --> 08:47.894
it meant
we were close to home.

08:48.126 --> 08:50.629
And the Seven Sisters?

08:51.831 --> 08:56.067
Well, the name is very unusual.
As a child, it always intrigued

08:56.100 --> 09:00.639
me. Who where the seven sisters?
Where they daughters of a King?

09:00.672 --> 09:04.910
Or were they Servants that made
a huge sacrifice for the

09:04.942 --> 09:08.746
kingdom? I don t know,
so looking at the map

09:08.779 --> 09:13.785
it brought back memories. So,
who were the seven sisters?

09:14.119 --> 09:16.855
And I am supposed to know
that because?

09:17.456 --> 09:19.825
Well, You are white
and you are from England.

09:23.128 --> 09:26.165
God you are charming.
Oh, God.

09:26.764 --> 09:30.735
Hmm. Hmm.

09:30.769 --> 09:35.608
Dom. Romans Conti,
French Red Burgundy, one of my

09:35.640 --> 09:38.176
delights. Always has been.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.883
Do you drink?

09:44.549 --> 09:47.986
You should. You should
see my wine collection.

09:48.453 --> 09:51.189
Now about those seven sisters,
that is a tale of ancient

09:51.222 --> 09:55.727
shrines, fecund families and
most of all trees. There have

09:55.760 --> 09:58.029
been a number of myths about the
leafy landmark somewhere around

09:58.062 --> 10:01.232
Page Green. There is really
nothing of concern there for you

10:01.765 --> 10:03.769
There is really nothing
of concern there for you

10:03.802 --> 10:06.839
besides the unusual name. But if
I were you, which I'm not.

10:07.471 --> 10:11.009
I'd be more concerned with the
modern day seven sisters.

10:13.912 --> 10:16.749
I don t think I follow Sir.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.985
Well, I guess I should tell you
a little story as well.

10:21.019 --> 10:24.123
One summer night, if my memory
serves me correctly it was

10:24.155 --> 10:29.060
August 28, 1928 at a castle
known as Achnacarry, three

10:29.094 --> 10:32.665
men, a Dutchman Henry Deterding
nicknamed the Napoleon

10:32.697 --> 10:35.233
of Oil, an English, Sir John
Cadman, the director of the

10:35.267 --> 10:39.104
Anglo-Persian Oil Company,
now known as BP and an American

10:39.136 --> 10:42.206
Walter C. Teagle representing
Standard Oil Company founded by

10:42.240 --> 10:46.445
of course, John D. Rockefeller
presently called Exxon.

10:46.477 --> 10:51.683
While these three men met
over a three day weekend.

10:52.518 --> 10:56.120
And they decided to stop
fighting and start sharing

10:56.153 --> 10:58.890
the world's oil. Their vision
was to agree on and share

10:58.923 --> 11:01.927
everything from the control of
production zones, to sale

11:01.960 --> 11:05.230
prices, and transport costs,
etc, etc, etc.

11:05.263 --> 11:10.269
This meeting unfortunately,
gave birth to a cartel.

11:10.635 --> 11:13.038
Do you know what a cartel
is young lady?

11:13.505 --> 11:15.206
This one had the aim
of dominating the world by

11:15.240 --> 11:17.475
controlling the world s oil.

11:17.509 --> 11:21.813
Soon after that they were joined
by four others and came to be

11:21.846 --> 11:25.817
known of course,
as the Seven Sisters.

11:28.153 --> 11:29.822
Seven Sisters?

11:29.855 --> 11:33.091
Yes. But bearing no resemblance
of course to the seven sisters

11:33.125 --> 11:35.027
of London.

11:35.059 --> 11:39.263
Anyway. Since that meeting,
they have been plotting and

11:39.297 --> 11:42.234
scheming and seeking to control
the balance of power.

11:42.267 --> 11:45.037
Supporting monarchies and other
leaders from Iran to Saudi

11:45.070 --> 11:48.173
Arabia, toppling governments and
installing puppets leaders as

11:48.206 --> 11:51.243
well as opposing the creation of
OPEC in pursuance of their

11:51.275 --> 11:54.278
own vision. Not many people
know this but at the end of the

11:54.312 --> 11:59.051
1960's, the Seven Sisters
controlled 85 percent of the

12:00.051 --> 12:03.855
world s oil reserves.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.125
But now new players
have joined the great oil game

12:06.158 --> 12:10.962
and they control just 10
percent. So...

12:10.995 --> 12:14.165
with the need for new markets,
the new hunting ground is now

12:14.198 --> 12:17.969
Africa. Lovely Africa.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.907
Interestingly though, the
Seven Sisters usually come out

12:21.940 --> 12:23.909
out on top, the host countries
of course having the worst

12:23.942 --> 12:28.846
time of it all. Libya, Gabon,
Nigeria and of course,

12:28.879 --> 12:31.182
recently Sudan.

12:34.285 --> 12:37.288
So with talks of possible oil
discovery in the region,

12:37.322 --> 12:41.058
your concern should be
these seven Sisters and not

12:41.091 --> 12:44.163
about the name of a London
transport station.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.033
Mr. Smith.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.902
Bossman.

12:49.934 --> 12:51.569
Welcome,
welcome Mr Smith.

12:51.602 --> 12:52.737
Thank you.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.573
Welcome.
So, what you bring for Bossman today?

12:55.606 --> 12:57.208
Well, Mr Bossman we-

12:57.241 --> 13:02.247
What is this Mr Smith?
You insult Bossman?

13:04.349 --> 13:08.086
You bring bed
friend to arms deal?

13:08.119 --> 13:13.125
Bed friend? What bed friend?
Bossman, meet Chelsea,

13:13.291 --> 13:16.228
The best
deal broker you ll ever meet.

13:16.894 --> 13:18.062
The best who?

13:18.096 --> 13:20.231
Deal broker.

13:22.399 --> 13:25.102
Mr Smith, I ask you a question.

13:25.135 --> 13:30.074
Mosquito bite you since you come
to Watz? Yes?

13:30.107 --> 13:31.609
No.

13:31.643 --> 13:34.146
You suffer malaria, Yes?

13:34.178 --> 13:35.079
No.

13:35.113 --> 13:37.883
No?

13:40.985 --> 13:43.221
What you bring?

14:25.029 --> 14:29.300
This is, uh, this is good.
Very good.

14:45.049 --> 14:48.052
Very good. Very good. I like.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.360
Yes. I like.
I like very much.

14:57.294 --> 14:59.464
Boys.

15:03.368 --> 15:07.306
Mr Smith, Ghetto.

15:28.025 --> 15:33.031
So, Mr Smith, how much I pay?

15:34.331 --> 15:37.970
Well, you see Bossman,
this is free.

15:44.241 --> 15:48.980
Free? Free? I tell you something
Mr Smith. Nothing in life is

15:50.782 --> 15:55.387
free, nothing. So, tell me,
how much I pay for

15:55.419 --> 15:58.156
to cover merchandise, eh?

16:00.291 --> 16:01.293
Smoke?

16:01.326 --> 16:03.995
No, I brought my favourite.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.282
Thank you.

16:24.816 --> 16:27.252
You know, what I am about to
tell you is top secret.

16:27.284 --> 16:32.189
In fact it s so top secret it's
not written on any documents.

16:32.222 --> 16:35.526
Chelsea here represents a small
group of people that are so deep

16:35.559 --> 16:40.264
behind the scenes they're
considered to be a myth, yet

16:40.298 --> 16:44.269
real. Now, in the coming
weeks or months, there will

16:44.302 --> 16:48.072
be an announcement of commercial
quantity oil discovery in the

16:48.105 --> 16:53.044
South East Province of Watz
Republic. Presently this is the

16:53.979 --> 16:57.615
most volatile region in the
republic with three warlords

16:57.649 --> 17:01.153
fighting for supremacy. Now,

17:01.186 --> 17:06.124
You my friend control 50% of
this and it is no secret

17:06.156 --> 17:09.461
that you would love to control
the remaining part,

17:09.493 --> 17:14.298
but standing in your way
are two more warlords that

17:14.332 --> 17:17.169
share control of the other 50%.

17:18.368 --> 17:23.375
Impressive, very, very
impressive Mr Smith.

17:23.674 --> 17:27.678
You do homework, good, very
good. But I ask again,

17:29.580 --> 17:32.150
how much I pay?

17:32.351 --> 17:35.620
My employers are willing to
help you take control of the whole

17:35.653 --> 17:39.458
region. We are willing to
support you with superior fire

17:39.490 --> 17:43.095
power, intelligence and
financially to make your

17:43.127 --> 17:47.566
ambition a reality. Imagine, how
rich and powerful you ll be with

17:47.598 --> 17:51.669
full control over the soon to be
oil rich region of the country.

17:51.702 --> 17:55.473
Think of what you can do with
that sort of wealth and power.

17:55.507 --> 17:59.545
Bossman not talking to you.

18:00.912 --> 18:05.483
Bossman talking to you Mr Smith.
I ask for the last time.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.653
How much I pay
for to cover merchandise?

18:10.221 --> 18:14.259
Nothing! Just partner
with us to progress.

18:51.229 --> 18:56.235
You think Bossman stupid? Yes?
No? Bossman no stupid at all.

18:59.537 --> 19:03.441
You want Bossman to surrender to
new master, so my people suffer?

19:03.473 --> 19:06.744
Sir, your people have suffered
inequality and neglect just

19:06.778 --> 19:09.948
about as anyone else under the
mastership of different corrupt

19:09.980 --> 19:11.516
leaders in your country

19:11.548 --> 19:14.552
Which is why we no surrender to
another master again.

19:14.586 --> 19:18.557
This deal will be off the
table the moment we walk out of those

19:18.589 --> 19:23.528
doors. The people I work for do
not have patience for long

19:23.560 --> 19:28.466
negotiations and take a very
deem view of uncompromising

19:29.666 --> 19:32.203
subjects.

19:44.515 --> 19:49.487
Bossman subject? You think
Bossman subject?

19:49.519 --> 19:54.225
Mr. Smith, you threaten Bossman?

19:56.661 --> 19:59.831
Tell me, how
many people you give same deal?

20:00.964 --> 20:05.369
You come here, you give me
dynamite, you give my enemy

20:05.403 --> 20:08.373
dynamite, then you light fuse
and you go back to your country

20:08.405 --> 20:11.342
you wait,
we kill ourselves. For what?

20:11.375 --> 20:15.413
Bossman, listen. This deal puts
you in a fantastic position.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.749
You ll be so relevant that the
president will want you on his

20:17.781 --> 20:19.750
side.

20:20.518 --> 20:24.823
Bossman, this is probably your
best chance at staying

20:24.855 --> 20:27.625
relevant as there will be too
many factions fighting for

20:27.659 --> 20:30.629
control over the new oil region.

20:31.462 --> 20:36.468
You and your men, and, your
people, as a minority,

20:37.268 --> 20:42.507
you will be overrun very quickly
if you don't have a superior

20:42.539 --> 20:46.744
military might. How long do you
think you would last as a dog of

20:46.778 --> 20:51.615
war? This is a real chance for
you and your people to grab

20:51.648 --> 20:53.851
real power.

20:54.885 --> 20:58.789
So, I suggest that you deal now
or your people will suffer an

20:58.823 --> 21:01.460
even greater inequality.

21:02.626 --> 21:07.832
Mr. Smith, the worst form of
inequality is to try to make

21:09.866 --> 21:12.470
unequal things equal.

21:12.502 --> 21:13.471
What?

21:13.805 --> 21:18.777
Aristotle. What s the matter?
You think Bossman no read? Yes?

21:25.115 --> 21:30.321
As long as poverty and gross
inequality persist in our world,

21:30.555 --> 21:35.394
no one, none of us can truly
rest. You know who say that?

21:36.493 --> 21:38.562
Plato?

21:38.596 --> 21:43.501
Wrong. Nelson Mandela! Now, go.
Get out. Tell your people,

21:44.301 --> 21:48.839
thank you. Tell them, we keep
arms but we no join.

21:48.873 --> 21:52.611
We take our chances. Bossman
talking to you.

22:32.450 --> 22:37.389
Fellow Countrymen and
Women. I Lt. Col. A. Kanze of the Watz

22:38.189 --> 22:41.893
Republic army address you this

22:41.925 --> 22:46.630
Republic Armed Forces. You are
all living witnesses to the

22:46.663 --> 22:51.670
harsh economic predicament and
uncertainty, which an inept and

22:52.336 --> 22:57.541
corrupt leadership has imposed
on our beloved nation for years.

22:58.209 --> 23:02.881
I am referring to the harsh,
intolerable conditions under

23:02.913 --> 23:07.652
which the common man is now
living, while the rich plunder

23:07.684 --> 23:12.557
and waste our vast resources on
vain and senseless spending both

23:12.589 --> 23:17.661
at home and abroad. We have
become a beggar nation and

23:17.694 --> 23:20.798
debtor to their foreign
collaborators with whom they

23:20.832 --> 23:24.836
have hopelessly mismanaged our
economy.

23:24.868 --> 23:29.875
As protectors of our national
interest, we have decided to

23:30.775 --> 23:35.513
effect a change in the puppet
leadership installed by the

23:35.546 --> 23:38.783
manipulators of our country s
affairs in the name of

23:38.816 --> 23:43.520
leadership of the government of
the Watz Republic and form a

23:43.554 --> 23:45.857
Federal Military Government.

23:45.890 --> 23:50.461
I am referring to the harsh,
intolerable conditions under

23:50.494 --> 23:55.500
which the common man is now
living, while the rich plunder

23:55.700 --> 23:59.003
and waste our vast resources on
vain and senseless spending both

24:06.009 --> 24:07.878
I'm coming.

24:09.747 --> 24:11.816
Mrs Assanbe,
is everything alright?

24:11.848 --> 24:13.250
Please. Can I come in Miss Zaya?

24:13.284 --> 24:16.755
Sure, forgive my manners,
please let me get you something.

24:27.964 --> 24:29.967
Some juice and biscuits?

24:30.999 --> 24:33.738
Thank you Miss Zaya.

24:33.770 --> 24:36.907
This is so nice of you.

24:38.910 --> 24:43.615
Have you been following this
news? This is a coup isn't it?

24:45.115 --> 24:47.618
I m Afraid so.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.721
What happen s now?

24:51.556 --> 24:56.561
I don t know. I thought we were
over this. Just when everything

24:57.827 --> 24:59.998
was becoming normal here.

25:00.030 --> 25:03.567
I am just so worried.

25:03.601 --> 25:07.772
Ah, where s Edwin? Is he not
back from school yet?

25:07.805 --> 25:10.842
He is in the hostel he comes
home on the weekends.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.010
Ah, that can't be safe?

25:13.044 --> 25:16.314
Quite frankly, I m getting
worried myself. I called

25:16.346 --> 25:19.116
him several times
but the network is off.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.786
I promised my friend, Regina
that I will look after him.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.855
But what if something has
happened to him?

25:23.887 --> 25:28.091
No, no, no. Nothing will happen,
he ll be just fine. Just fine.

25:28.125 --> 25:33.097
But, maybe, it may not be so
bad after all.

25:33.464 --> 25:37.067
Our luck may just be changing.
Have you heard

25:37.101 --> 25:41.639
Have you heard the rumor that
they have discovered oil here in

25:41.672 --> 25:44.608
our region? Hahaha

25:44.642 --> 25:45.677
No!

25:45.710 --> 25:49.346
No? I thought this would be
good news. Imagine the

25:49.380 --> 25:53.117
opportunities, plenty of jobs,
plenty of growth. Zaya,

25:53.150 --> 25:55.920
finally our country can develop
fast.

25:55.952 --> 25:59.757
Says who? Have you not noticed
that wherever they discover oil,

25:59.789 --> 26:00.791
you see turmoil?

26:00.825 --> 26:02.026
Turmoil?

26:02.059 --> 26:05.062
Yes, the problems of oil. The
dictionary describes it as a

26:05.096 --> 26:09.133
state of great disturbance,
unrest, uncertainty, everything

26:09.165 --> 26:11.001
you name them.

26:11.035 --> 26:12.202
In this country?

26:12.236 --> 26:16.674
In this country my dear. So,
please do not wish for oil.

26:16.707 --> 26:20.845
Ask the Nigerians. Trust me Mrs
Assanbe, the last thing we need

26:20.877 --> 26:24.115
in this country, is the
discovery of oil.

26:24.414 --> 26:28.685
WKIF, the station with Big Chuka.
It s a pretty hot day

26:28.719 --> 26:32.390
today in Lagos, Nigeria. Per as
usual expect some rains

26:32.423 --> 26:35.792
and when it rains here, you
know it pours. It's yours truly

26:35.826 --> 26:37.929
the Fresh One
welcoming you as we kickstart

26:37.961 --> 26:42.032
this with two of Nigeria s
finest, DJ Jimmy Jatt featuring

26:42.066 --> 26:44.669
Flavour with the smash hit Turn
Up!

27:27.811 --> 27:30.147
We are coming to you live
from the Lekki-Epe expressway, where

27:30.181 --> 27:33.183
two horrific explosions have

27:33.217 --> 27:36.054
ambulances and fire service are
battling to save lives. cause

27:36.086 --> 27:39.856
of explosion is unknown, we
bring you more as this unfolds.

27:39.890 --> 27:43.227
Lagos has been thrown in
chaos as two devastating blasts claim

27:43.259 --> 27:47.798
lives and properties. 14 persons
feared dead and more than 24

27:47.832 --> 27:51.169
others are critically injured as
a result of two horrific

27:51.201 --> 27:54.271
explosions along the Lekki-Epe
expressway.

27:54.305 --> 27:57.075
Two devastating blast
claim lives and properties along the

27:57.107 --> 28:00.110
the Lekki-Epe expressway. 14
persons feared dead and more

28:00.144 --> 28:02.980
than 24 others critically
injured as a result of two

28:03.012 --> 28:04.816
horrific explosions.

28:04.848 --> 28:06.783
You cannot be seriously
advocating for a state of

28:06.817 --> 28:08.819
emergency in
Lagos at this point.

28:08.853 --> 28:12.190
Oh but I am. Insecurity
is becoming a norm. This might as

28:12.222 --> 28:15.759
well be an insurgency attack.
The question is where are our

28:15.792 --> 28:17.894
security agencies? Where are
those that are supposed to be

28:17.928 --> 28:19.363
protecting us? Where
are they?

28:19.395 --> 28:22.866
These are the questions we
must continually ask our government

28:22.900 --> 28:25.236
and those at the helm of
affairs. And we will not stop to

28:25.269 --> 28:26.837
hold them accountable.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.906
These are the issues.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.207
Indeed they are. Thank you very
much for doing us.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.441
Thank you very much.

28:30.474 --> 28:32.809
This is where we end the show.
Thank you very much for joining

28:32.843 --> 28:35.313
us, my name is Olive Emordi,
good night.

28:35.746 --> 28:37.982
Mr Commissioner,
we re all aware of the security

28:38.015 --> 28:41.185
concerns in the city presently,
as the head of security in

28:41.218 --> 28:44.055
the state, can
you assure the people of Lagos

28:44.087 --> 28:46.022
of their
lives and properties?

28:46.056 --> 28:49.026
My men are being given enough
powers to bring

28:49.058 --> 28:54.097
these nefarious activities to a
stop by all means necessary and

28:54.131 --> 28:58.536
to restore peace and stability
to the city.

28:58.568 --> 29:01.338
These threats seem to
be boiling over, and many Nigerians

29:01.372 --> 29:04.108
are calling for the declaration
of a state of emergency.

29:04.141 --> 29:06.277
What s your take on that Mr
Commissioner?

29:06.309 --> 29:10.881
There won t be any need for a
state of emergency now.

29:10.914 --> 29:14.951
Gentleman, that is as much
time as we have to take

29:14.984 --> 29:17.788
questions, all other
correspondence shall be made

29:17.821 --> 29:21.258
available to you as events
unfold. Thank you

29:32.102 --> 29:35.306
The larger explosion
was as a result of a smaller one

29:35.338 --> 29:39.076
that was deliberately set off
at an apartment at Number 33

29:39.108 --> 29:43.079
Ayodele Street, in the lekki
axis of Lagos. The apartment

29:43.113 --> 29:47.351
belongs to a certain Mr. Demsey
Egan, a human rights activist

29:47.384 --> 29:52.323
and a lawyer by profession. He
is known to have been very vocal

29:52.355 --> 29:55.259
about the Federal
government s handling of

29:55.291 --> 29:59.329
insurgency issues. Arrested
twice for his outspokenness, he

29:59.363 --> 30:04.302
has devoted his life to exposing
corrupt practices surrounding

30:04.335 --> 30:07.171
the growth of insurgency in
Nigeria.

30:07.203 --> 30:11.875
So what
exactly are you looking for?

30:11.909 --> 30:15.947
We re looking for foreign
currency dealings related to

30:15.980 --> 30:18.048
him, or his associates.

30:20.384 --> 30:22.252
Was anyone at home?

30:22.286 --> 30:24.087
Pardon?

30:24.121 --> 30:26.624
Was anyone
home, when the blast occurred?

30:26.656 --> 30:31.428
Yes. One male, 28-30 and
one female 26-28.

30:33.897 --> 30:35.632
Did they survive?

30:35.665 --> 30:37.868
Yes. mysteriously, they did.

30:37.902 --> 30:41.873
So, Go get them, they could be
the missing links to solving

30:41.905 --> 30:43.073
this affair.

30:43.106 --> 30:45.942
Well, unfortunately the police
already has them. They re

30:45.976 --> 30:48.646
currently being kept under high
security watch at an undisclosed

30:48.679 --> 30:53.317
hospital, pending if or when
they come out of coma.

30:53.349 --> 30:58.288
Well, you get to them first. How
you do that is off the records.

30:58.689 --> 31:00.157
Sir.

31:00.190 --> 31:01.659
Colonel Bello.

31:01.692 --> 31:02.492
Sir?

31:02.526 --> 31:04.262
You ll see to it.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.230
Yes Sir.

31:11.468 --> 31:15.139
Police have released
cctv footage of two suspects

31:15.172 --> 31:18.675
connected to the recent bomb
blast. Now they are asking for

31:18.709 --> 31:21.412
anyone with information about
the identities of these two to

31:21.444 --> 31:25.148
come forward. Airports and all
borders are on high alert. And

31:25.182 --> 31:28.385
the authorities have said that
no one has come forward to claim

31:28.419 --> 31:31.422
responsibility for this attack
which is being deemed at many

31:31.454 --> 31:34.925
quarters to be an insurgency.

31:40.297 --> 31:44.168
Rioters have taken over parts
of the streets. There are reports

31:44.201 --> 31:46.703
of increased violence, looting
and destruction to public

31:46.737 --> 31:50.341
properties and human lives. The
police appear to be overwhelmed

31:50.374 --> 31:55.211
by the increase of attacks and
the blast of last week.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.148
Egan!

32:32.182 --> 32:36.120
Egan! How do you always get
yourself into this situation?

32:36.153 --> 32:38.221
Regina you need to get out of
here, this is going to blow

32:38.255 --> 32:39.757
anytime soon. Regina, just go!

32:39.789 --> 32:42.192
Shut up!

32:47.597 --> 32:49.533
Can you walk?

32:52.803 --> 32:57.175
Regina, Regina.

33:39.615 --> 33:42.086
Shhh.

34:32.668 --> 34:35.338
I think they
climbed down through the window.

34:35.371 --> 34:39.210
They should be on the street and
will be heading your way.

34:39.242 --> 34:41.545
So look out for them. The police
men?

34:42.512 --> 34:46.516
The police men? All dead.

35:17.713 --> 35:20.918
I see them, they are
in the crowd, quick, they are heading

35:20.951 --> 35:23.653
toward you. I ll fence them in.

35:37.434 --> 35:38.936
Red 4, they are coming your way.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.239
I m in position

35:42.706 --> 35:44.508
Target acquired.

35:44.541 --> 35:47.411
Get in now!

35:47.443 --> 35:50.181
Shoot them!!!

35:52.481 --> 35:54.951
He was actually
shooting to kill us.

35:54.985 --> 35:57.288
You are suspected of
a terrorist blast in the heart of

35:57.320 --> 36:00.423
the city and your collaborators
kill four policemen in the bid

36:00.456 --> 36:03.293
to rescue you from police
custody what do you expect?

36:03.327 --> 36:05.429
We didn't do any
of that and you know it.

36:05.461 --> 36:09.199
Well now you have.
Put your seat belt on.

36:11.735 --> 36:15.338
So, where are we going? Aren't
you supposed to be taking us in?

36:15.371 --> 36:20.377
Nah, this
time, I m saving your asses

36:23.380 --> 36:25.282
Why?

36:31.588 --> 36:32.590
Get out.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.492
Once again, Why?

36:34.757 --> 36:38.695
Get out now! You out!

36:45.635 --> 36:49.773
Major Egan.
You're a difficult man to find.

36:56.612 --> 37:00.617
It s just a precautionary
measure. Actually Major, I m

37:00.650 --> 37:04.355
going to need you to trust me.

37:05.554 --> 37:09.393
Now ma'am,
please strap his wrists.

37:20.436 --> 37:24.608
Thank you.
Now, you strap hers.

37:26.409 --> 37:30.413
Come on major, If I wanted to
kill you, I would have shot you

37:30.447 --> 37:35.419
in your head, a long ago. Like I
said, I need you to trust me.

37:37.820 --> 37:41.391
Now strap hers.

37:58.842 --> 38:01.345
Thank you.

38:14.557 --> 38:17.862
Ma'am, please sit.
Thank you.

38:39.148 --> 38:43.688
You ll be safe here and
I ll be right back.

38:53.663 --> 38:54.764
We lost them sir.

38:54.797 --> 38:57.467
And how
did you manage to do that?

38:57.501 --> 38:59.503
They had help.

38:59.536 --> 39:00.903
What?

39:00.936 --> 39:05.141
Captain David,
he turned on us, Sir.

39:05.175 --> 39:10.381
The slimy bastard, he knew.
Now listen, none of them makes it

39:10.547 --> 39:13.916
alive. You get me? None of them

39:13.949 --> 39:18.655
Gentlemen, we have work to do.

39:39.943 --> 39:41.745
The Colonel.

39:41.777 --> 39:44.781
Captain,
your job was to bring them in.

39:44.815 --> 39:48.519
It was? cause it sure did not
look that way with the trail of

39:48.552 --> 39:50.653
blood you left in the process.

39:50.686 --> 39:53.956
Captain, Bring them in.

39:53.989 --> 39:56.692
No can t do that.

39:56.726 --> 39:59.797
Listen to me you piece of shit.
You are way off the

39:59.829 --> 40:03.833
authorization here, if you do
this, you are on your own and

40:03.867 --> 40:07.538
your career is over.
Do you understand?

40:07.570 --> 40:11.708
I understand that my career was
over the moment you put a hit on

40:11.740 --> 40:16.713
me. You think you are safe in
your fancy office. But hear

40:18.715 --> 40:23.721
this, if I go down, you go down
with me.

40:53.884 --> 40:58.889
Major, listen carefully cause
I ll say this only once. What I

40:59.722 --> 41:04.862
What I am am about to tell you
might shock you but it is true.

41:05.528 --> 41:09.833
You are presently listed as
enemy of state number one for

41:09.865 --> 41:11.501
what you did.

41:11.534 --> 41:13.036
But you set that off.

41:13.068 --> 41:16.873
I did?

41:25.748 --> 41:28.584
Well, I wasn't responsible for
the illegal storage of gas

41:28.617 --> 41:32.288
cylinders in a residential area
that caused the catastrophic

41:32.322 --> 41:37.126
explosion. Was I? Anyway, as the
story goes, with the aid of your

41:39.862 --> 41:43.866
co-conspirators who broke into a
heavily guarded hospital you

41:43.900 --> 41:48.639
managed to escape police custody
killing four policemen in the

41:48.672 --> 41:53.644
process and you are presently at
large. How does that sound?

41:56.146 --> 41:57.314
Not good.

41:57.347 --> 42:02.653
Precisely! And the crowning
moment of this was when you

42:03.820 --> 42:08.759
two are supposed to be shot in
the head while trying to escape.

42:08.791 --> 42:10.894
Problem solved.

42:13.862 --> 42:18.067
And where do you fit into in
this ploy?

42:20.936 --> 42:24.942
A complete wipe off of anything
or person that could even in the

42:24.974 --> 42:29.112
remotest way lead back to the
Colonel, that is to say,

42:29.646 --> 42:34.852
I was next in line, but I found
out. Now I am stuck with you

42:36.186 --> 42:41.025
two losers and with my career
more or less over.

42:41.724 --> 42:42.925
Lovely.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.096
Wait, so let me try
to understand something here.

42:46.128 --> 42:50.701
This man does
all these things to you two and

42:50.733 --> 42:53.002
all you can think of is run?

42:53.036 --> 42:55.972
What happened to standing up for
what you believe in and proving

42:56.005 --> 42:58.942
your innocence so help me God?

43:00.943 --> 43:04.114
Yeah, she has a point you know?

43:04.746 --> 43:06.049
She's not just a pretty face.

43:07.784 --> 43:12.088
So we just storm the military
headquarters,

43:12.121 --> 43:16.626
with our story we demand to be
given a fair trial, hm?

43:18.161 --> 43:22.932
Against a general in the
Nigerian Army with our story

43:22.965 --> 43:27.971
alone. Humor me, how
do you reckon that will pan out?

43:31.775 --> 43:36.813
Not good I suppose, but it s
better than running around and

43:36.846 --> 43:40.050
becoming fugitives.

43:44.721 --> 43:48.125
Colonel Kanze a week ago.
Our supposed wonder boy has turned

43:48.157 --> 43:52.429
into a disaster. Since we helped
him seize power as the interim

43:52.461 --> 43:55.197
head of state, he has gone from
one demand to another.

43:55.231 --> 43:58.802
He is now insisting on being
made the permanent and

43:58.835 --> 44:02.239
legitimate president of Watz
Republic with sanctions lifted

44:02.271 --> 44:03.739
or he ll sing.

44:03.773 --> 44:07.877
That just leaves me with
one thought. Let the damn fools have

44:07.911 --> 44:12.715
their day, what do we care? So
this Kanze is taking out

44:12.748 --> 44:17.053
oppositions, and the others are
killing themselves, big deal.

44:17.086 --> 44:20.923
Sounds like they re doing us a
favor. As long as it doesn't

44:20.956 --> 44:25.929
interfere with our course or
lead back to us, I think that s

44:25.961 --> 44:30.166
kind of fine and dandy.
You with me?

44:30.699 --> 44:34.804
Well, I think it's time for a
toast, but,

44:34.838 --> 44:39.009
let us be reminded why
we can just walk into these

44:39.041 --> 44:44.014
people s backyards and operate
the way we do time after time.

44:46.849 --> 44:51.855
It is because they do not trust
one another and that s the key

44:54.958 --> 44:59.963
to our dominance. So I say, now
the fire is lite lets just sit

45:00.929 --> 45:05.067
back and let it burn, hopefully,
we ll be able to waltz

45:05.101 --> 45:08.872
right back in and gather
the ashes.

45:11.007 --> 45:16.012
It goes without saying
that when the political and wealthy

45:16.278 --> 45:21.251
classes continue with their
selfish attitudes against the

45:21.284 --> 45:26.289
rest, the pain of the rest will
soon engulf them.

45:28.992 --> 45:33.964
When our roads spoil instead of
building new roads, they buy

45:33.996 --> 45:39.001
SUV s. When our hospitals
collapse-they go abroad for

45:42.172 --> 45:47.177
treatment. They let our schools
go rotten by not paying

45:47.577 --> 45:51.915
teachers. The uneducated
graduates that you separated

45:51.947 --> 45:56.353
your children from are your
today s nemesis.

45:57.086 --> 46:02.259
Time is a settler and the hand
of justice is long.

46:03.927 --> 46:07.164
Brothers and sisters, power
belongs to the people. Unite,

46:07.197 --> 46:12.235
and stop killing one another. Be
your brothers keeper. Fight the

46:12.268 --> 46:17.273
power and not your brothers.
Power belongs to the people

46:57.646 --> 47:01.418
The number you have
reached is not in service.

47:38.688 --> 47:42.025
Targets have resurfaced, sir

48:15.324 --> 48:17.493
What s our teams ETA?

48:17.527 --> 48:20.130
3 minutes out sir.

48:41.384 --> 48:44.721
Will you stop pacing
about, you are freaking me out!

48:44.753 --> 48:47.389
She is taking too long,
the freaking food court is just a

48:47.422 --> 48:49.992
few blocks away.
Something must be wrong.

48:50.025 --> 48:53.297
Maybe she is in trouble and
I should go and look for her.

48:54.329 --> 48:56.365
She must be the one.

49:05.173 --> 49:07.411
Shit!

49:20.088 --> 49:23.293
No freaking way,
she just let the hounds to us.

49:23.326 --> 49:26.161
What the fuck? How did you
manage to do that from just

49:26.195 --> 49:27.230
going to buy groceries?

49:27.262 --> 49:29.098
I don t know.

49:29.132 --> 49:30.333
You don t know Regina?

49:30.367 --> 49:35.205
No Egan, I don t know. In fact I
don t know anything anymore.

49:35.804 --> 49:38.474
It s been a freaking tornado
from the moment I got here,

49:38.507 --> 49:42.144
from your rescue mission to set
you free from a gas explosion,

49:42.177 --> 49:47.083
to a filing station being raised
to the ground and a shoot out at

49:47.516 --> 49:52.121
the hospital. Me constantly
dodging and running from

49:52.155 --> 49:57.127
bullets. And now I don t even
know where my brother is, Edwin

49:57.159 --> 50:01.498
or my friend Zaya because war
has broken out in my country and

50:01.530 --> 50:05.601
I have no clue, where
they are or if they are okay.

50:05.635 --> 50:09.439
So Egan, I don t know.

50:10.505 --> 50:12.107
No!

50:12.141 --> 50:16.413
It s not alright. My job
isn t to dodge bullets.

50:16.445 --> 50:20.616
I'm not a soldier, you are.
You both are. My job is

50:22.150 --> 50:26.588
to save lives and
treat the sick, but all we ve

50:26.621 --> 50:31.060
done is leave a trail of dead
bodies everywhere we go.

50:31.094 --> 50:35.231
And I m supposed to be alright
with that?

50:36.331 --> 50:40.170
I'm a doctor for Christ sake.

50:48.110 --> 50:52.281
Major, we leave now
or we die here.

51:22.244 --> 51:24.547
What are you doing?

51:24.579 --> 51:27.884
What I should have done long
ago. If we are going to stop

51:27.916 --> 51:29.885
running like this, we ll
have to take the bull head-on.

51:29.918 --> 51:32.121
How do you suppose we do that?

51:33.322 --> 51:37.426
Turn ourselves in, but with some
sort of insurance policy.

51:38.628 --> 51:39.896
Egan.

51:39.929 --> 51:40.896
Hello?

51:40.929 --> 51:42.464
Hello?

51:42.498 --> 51:43.432
Dave, are you crazy?
What are you doing calling me at work?

51:43.465 --> 51:45.634
Don't you know that you
are an enemy of the

51:45.668 --> 51:46.635
state right now?

51:46.668 --> 51:48.237
I'm hanging up.

51:48.271 --> 51:50.173
You're going to that to your
own person?

51:50.206 --> 51:52.509
Things don't look
good for you and that major at all.

51:52.541 --> 51:53.543
We need to come in,

51:53.577 --> 51:55.912
but we ll need some sort of
insurance policy.

51:55.945 --> 51:59.382
Can you pull up the records of
my dealings with Colonel Bello?

51:59.414 --> 52:01.183
Which ones?
The off the record ones?

52:01.217 --> 52:02.418
Yes those ones in particular.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.320
Okay,
Forty five minutes to one hour tops.

52:04.353 --> 52:07.356
Yeah, thank you, I owe you one.

52:07.956 --> 52:10.426
Dave, you re sure about this?

52:10.626 --> 52:14.563
I trust her besides, we have
no other choice.

53:09.818 --> 53:14.757
That was a close call. I am
Logan, Logan Esin.

53:16.492 --> 53:21.231
Zaya, Zaya Rakan.
Thank you for saving my life.

53:21.496 --> 53:23.832
Yeah, It was
the least I could have done.

53:27.603 --> 53:29.572
My accent right?

53:29.806 --> 53:34.411
You do sound different.
So where are you from?

53:35.610 --> 53:37.446
I m a Nigerian.

53:38.181 --> 53:40.650
So what are you still doing
here?

53:42.818 --> 53:45.355
I m looking for a friend.

53:45.387 --> 53:47.356
You never heard of Facebook?

53:47.556 --> 53:50.325
Maybe if you showed
me where it is.

53:50.358 --> 53:54.329
Hmm, funny, but seriously what
are you still doing here? All

53:54.362 --> 53:57.466
foreigners were meant to be
out of the country right now.

54:00.369 --> 54:04.507
Like I said,
I am looking for a friend.

54:04.539 --> 54:06.543
Maybe you ve seen her.

54:08.411 --> 54:13.383
That is Oluchi and myself 12
months ago.

54:13.416 --> 54:16.352
4 months ago, she decided to

54:16.385 --> 54:19.522
join the
Red Cross in Bossangoa.

54:20.088 --> 54:24.559
Taking care of the displaced and
other affected by the recent war

54:24.592 --> 54:29.565
in Watz. She made it a point to
stay in touch and communicate

54:29.597 --> 54:31.867
every single day.

54:31.900 --> 54:36.839
Text messages, Skype,
WhatsApp, even phone calls

54:39.842 --> 54:42.412
whenever she could. And then
that's it, the communication

54:42.445 --> 54:43.680
just stopped.

54:43.713 --> 54:46.449
So did you contact the
authorities?

54:47.349 --> 54:51.688
All my attempts or the attempts
by the authorities to find out

54:54.657 --> 54:57.427
more information about her
whereabouts, well,

54:57.460 --> 54:59.695
from the police and

54:59.728 --> 55:03.465
all the other law enforcement
agencies have been met back with

55:03.498 --> 55:07.336
lies and sealed lips.

55:07.369 --> 55:09.873
That's why I'm here. To do
something about it.

55:11.940 --> 55:16.645
Here you are indeed, but how
do you intend on finding her?

55:17.179 --> 55:20.349
Do you realize that you are an
illegal alien on the streets of

55:20.382 --> 55:24.586
Bossangoa which makes you a
person non grata? Every

55:24.619 --> 55:27.856
foreigner was meant to be out
of the country. How did you

55:27.889 --> 55:31.560
get into the country anyway? I m
sorry but I must tell you -

55:31.594 --> 55:33.730
This is a suicide mission,
Mr Esin.

55:33.762 --> 55:35.731
You can call me Logan.

55:35.764 --> 55:39.735
Okay, Logan. How do you intend
on finding your friend? You want

55:39.768 --> 55:42.704
to storm every police
station in the hope of finding

55:42.737 --> 55:43.672
her? And then what?

55:43.706 --> 55:45.842
And then, I ll take her home.

55:46.742 --> 55:50.447
Why does that sound like a plan
that was doomed from the start?

55:50.646 --> 55:54.483
Look, I have to go and I
suggest that you do the same

55:54.516 --> 55:58.487
while you still can
because they may return.

56:01.489 --> 56:02.958
So, where are you going to now?

56:02.992 --> 56:06.162
To Lakama District I am hoping
to start closer to wherever the

56:06.195 --> 56:10.566
displaced are and hopefully I ll
bump into some co-workers.

56:10.599 --> 56:13.870
And soldiers, and police
officers and other you name

56:13.902 --> 56:17.939
them. That district is crawling
with security agents 24/7.

56:17.972 --> 56:22.744
That s fine by me. Look, I ve
got very little time to do

56:22.777 --> 56:25.447
this, especially before the
Nigerian embassy decides to

56:25.481 --> 56:29.685
withdraw from your
country. If I were you, I would

56:29.717 --> 56:30.986
head there.

56:31.019 --> 56:32.822
Why?

56:32.855 --> 56:36.592
Because they will take you in.
As long your country is still a

56:36.625 --> 56:41.630
part of the ECOWAS. That is your
only hope of survival.

56:42.297 --> 56:45.967
Look all the other embassies
have long since shut down,

56:46.001 --> 56:50.206
they've evacuated their staff,
but the Nigerian embassy is

56:50.239 --> 56:54.710
the only embassy on the
ground willing and waiting

56:54.742 --> 56:57.880
to evacuate as many lives
as possible.

56:58.248 --> 57:01.985
Now, you need to look out for
the green white green flag.

57:02.452 --> 57:05.721
If it is still flying then you
can assume the embassy is still

57:05.753 --> 57:10.759
in operation, but if the flag is
down, I would suggest you

57:10.992 --> 57:14.029
tread with caution as the
building may no longer be

57:14.063 --> 57:18.635
theirs, which means,
it won't be safe.

57:20.702 --> 57:23.840
Go while you still can.

57:28.010 --> 57:30.847
I will take my chances with you.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.249
Besides,
I can be of help to you.

57:33.282 --> 57:37.987
Just.

57:42.724 --> 57:43.893
Seriously, Logan-

57:43.925 --> 57:45.929
Stop!

57:48.030 --> 57:50.500
Stop the car!

57:51.867 --> 57:54.637
Come out of car now!

57:59.608 --> 58:01.110
Shoot them!

59:06.742 --> 59:09.579
So.

59:10.878 --> 59:14.918
You sleep with the enemy? Hmm?

59:20.389 --> 59:25.595
You, Bossangoa women. Miss Gina
betray me, Miss Angela betray me

59:25.994 --> 59:31.000
and now, you want to join too
eh? What is wrong with you

59:31.166 --> 59:35.738
Bossangoa women? Tell me, what?

59:36.871 --> 59:38.740
Please, Bossman.

59:43.012 --> 59:48.017
I tell you to speak?
Bossman tell you to talk?

59:50.686 --> 59:54.057
You talk when
Bossman tell you to talk.

59:59.061 --> 1:00:03.833
You know what this is? Yes? No?

1:00:03.865 --> 1:00:07.135
This is Nigerian Army medal.

1:00:07.168 --> 1:00:12.040
This is Naija army medal. You
betray me. You disappoint me.

1:00:12.074 --> 1:00:13.943
I didn t know he was a soldier.

1:00:13.976 --> 1:00:16.211
You didn t know he was a
soldier, but you know he is

1:00:16.244 --> 1:00:17.212
foreigner.

1:00:19.648 --> 1:00:24.854
You stupid, you greedy. Tell me
why? You sleep with the enemy?

1:00:25.221 --> 1:00:26.889
Nobody is sleeping with anybody!

1:00:26.922 --> 1:00:30.726
Shut up! Shut up woman!

1:00:30.759 --> 1:00:34.230
I show you what I do to
traitors, you infidel.

1:00:34.262 --> 1:00:35.965
Ghetto end this.

1:00:35.998 --> 1:00:37.266
You don t want to do that.

1:00:40.135 --> 1:00:41.903
What you say?

1:00:41.936 --> 1:00:46.074
I said you do not want to do
that. I have something you want.

1:00:52.981 --> 1:00:57.687
You think you know what
Bossman want, eh?

1:00:58.487 --> 1:01:01.824
What you think Bossman want?

1:01:01.856 --> 1:01:05.460
What you think Bossman
want more than bend you over

1:01:05.494 --> 1:01:07.963
right now!?
Tell me?

1:01:08.831 --> 1:01:12.235
Money, lots of money.

1:01:13.735 --> 1:01:14.971
What kind of money you talk?

1:01:15.003 --> 1:01:18.473
I m talking about the biggest
and most exclusive wine cellar

1:01:18.507 --> 1:01:23.246
in the whole republic, with
wines over a hundred years old.

1:01:24.112 --> 1:01:29.085
Yes Edwin, subtlety is the name
of the game.

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.255
My combination is my birthday.

1:01:34.289 --> 1:01:36.025
You don t know my
combination because you don t

1:01:36.057 --> 1:01:38.760
know my birthday.

1:01:43.831 --> 1:01:46.768
So let me ask you a question
young man.

1:01:47.135 --> 1:01:51.106
Have you ever heard
of Shipwrecked 1907?

1:01:51.139 --> 1:01:53.108
What is shipwrecked?

1:01:53.141 --> 1:01:57.946
This is Shipwrecked 1907,
Heidsieck the most expensive

1:01:58.947 --> 1:02:00.316
champagne in my collection.

1:02:00.349 --> 1:02:03.018
There can t be, in fact, I
know there aren't' more

1:02:03.050 --> 1:02:06.956
than 200 bottles worldwide and
this is one lying my hand.

1:02:08.023 --> 1:02:11.059
Wow! So, eh, how much is it?

1:02:11.092 --> 1:02:13.261
three thousand dollars?

1:02:13.295 --> 1:02:15.931
Oh, my lovely, naive young man.

1:02:15.963 --> 1:02:18.233
Let me let me tell you a little
story about Shipwrecked.

1:02:18.266 --> 1:02:20.235
It has an intriguing and
fascinating history.

1:02:20.268 --> 1:02:24.172
It is believed that during World
War 2, a ship was making it's

1:02:24.206 --> 1:02:27.276
way toward the Russian shore.
Was intercepted by a German

1:02:27.309 --> 1:02:31.313
tanker and in turn, sunk.
End of story, right?

1:02:31.346 --> 1:02:34.215
Not quite. In 1997 it's
recovered and brought up

1:02:34.248 --> 1:02:37.085
and what do they find but
200 bottles of this

1:02:37.119 --> 1:02:41.856
champagne and this champagne
is one of the most loved

1:02:41.889 --> 1:02:44.793
among wine lovers worldwide and
due to it's limited number

1:02:44.827 --> 1:02:47.096
and interesting background story

1:02:47.128 --> 1:02:52.067
each bottle now sells for at
least $275,000.

1:02:54.836 --> 1:02:56.038
For a drink?

1:02:56.070 --> 1:02:58.007
For a drink.

1:02:58.039 --> 1:03:02.811
So, what happens when I drink
it? I get more beautiful or stay

1:03:02.844 --> 1:03:04.112
young for ever?

1:03:04.146 --> 1:03:06.916
You see. That is the problem
with you women.

1:03:06.949 --> 1:03:10.019
You do not understand the
important things.

1:03:10.052 --> 1:03:12.355
All you want to talk about is
beauty, vanity.

1:03:12.621 --> 1:03:13.856
Looking young.

1:03:13.889 --> 1:03:14.990
- Really?
- Yes.

1:03:15.023 --> 1:03:17.192
So you are telling me that
spending over $200,000 on

1:03:17.226 --> 1:03:19.862
a bottle of wine is what is
worthy?

1:03:19.894 --> 1:03:22.931
Do you what that can do for the
suffering people in this world?

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:25.601
Okay. Fair enough.
But I ask you?

1:03:25.634 --> 1:03:28.336
How many of those
people can you help?

1:03:28.369 --> 1:03:32.340
How many and for how long?
Eh? That is how Utopia.

1:03:32.907 --> 1:03:35.978
Now this one here is not so much
about the cost

1:03:36.010 --> 1:03:38.980
as it is about the deception.

1:03:39.313 --> 1:03:41.983
Like a magician with his cards
in front of you...

1:03:42.016 --> 1:03:44.352
You know the answers right
there, but,

1:03:44.385 --> 1:03:47.856
it keeps you guessing right,
by using the art

1:03:47.889 --> 1:03:50.158
of distraction.

1:03:50.192 --> 1:03:52.862
Very ingenious.

1:03:53.427 --> 1:03:55.230
Ingenious indeed.

1:03:55.264 --> 1:03:58.334
That place is swarming with
them, imagine that.

1:03:58.934 --> 1:04:03.205
Bossman no want your stupid
wine. Bossman no want Watz

1:04:03.237 --> 1:04:05.106
money.
Watz money is shit money.

1:04:05.139 --> 1:04:07.375
Who s talking about worthless
Watz money?

1:04:07.409 --> 1:04:12.381
So, you give Bossman drink, what
Bossman do with drink? Drink,

1:04:12.414 --> 1:04:16.418
get drunk, Bossman get drink.
Then what? Bossman no want

1:04:16.451 --> 1:04:20.389
drink. Bossman want Dollars,
American Dollars. That is what

1:04:20.422 --> 1:04:22.992
Bossman want, not drink. You
stupid woman.

1:04:23.025 --> 1:04:27.997
Ah, you have never made money
like what I m about to show you.

1:04:28.831 --> 1:04:31.434
Bossman ever heard of
Shipwrecked?

1:04:31.934 --> 1:04:36.672
I didn t think so. One bottle of
that wine cost

1:04:36.704 --> 1:04:41.911
$275,000. So, you want to waste
time here while someone else

1:04:44.478 --> 1:04:47.949
gets to it? It s up to you.

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:08.436
Where this place?

1:05:35.463 --> 1:05:40.135
I like, I like. Very, Very much.

1:05:44.106 --> 1:05:47.510
White man live here before?
Hmm?

1:06:06.527 --> 1:06:10.498
White man enjoy everything
and my people,

1:06:10.532 --> 1:06:13.202
suffer for shanty town?

1:06:15.403 --> 1:06:17.505
Get up!

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:31.419
Where everything?
Show me. Now!

1:06:57.144 --> 1:07:00.315
Good, very very good.

1:07:00.849 --> 1:07:04.519
Very nice. White man live good.

1:07:05.487 --> 1:07:08.124
Very, very nice.

1:07:16.597 --> 1:07:21.369
White man live good. Live
very good in our country.

1:07:24.873 --> 1:07:27.242
Hey! You.

1:07:29.443 --> 1:07:30.411
What you do?

1:07:30.445 --> 1:07:31.614
Nothing.

1:07:32.047 --> 1:07:33.282
I say what you do?

1:07:33.315 --> 1:07:34.650
I said nothing.

1:07:39.487 --> 1:07:44.492
You want drink? Bossman,
tell you to drink?

1:07:46.561 --> 1:07:48.396
Give me.

1:07:49.563 --> 1:07:52.268
Give me, now!

1:07:57.639 --> 1:08:02.644
Live. Live.

1:08:03.911 --> 1:08:07.248
So, this, this, eh.

1:08:07.282 --> 1:08:09.652
This is life, huh?

1:08:11.418 --> 1:08:13.621
You like life?

1:08:13.655 --> 1:08:16.692
Yes? No?

1:08:18.426 --> 1:08:21.363
Bossman, like life, yes.

1:08:21.395 --> 1:08:25.266
Bossman, hold life
now in my hand.

1:08:25.734 --> 1:08:30.204
But you work for your life.

1:08:30.238 --> 1:08:34.243
Now do walk everything,
put inside truck now.

1:08:35.143 --> 1:08:40.314
Ghetto. Get boys, do work.
Put everything inside truck.

1:08:40.347 --> 1:08:43.418
Boys! Time to work.

1:08:48.289 --> 1:08:51.659
Everything. Every single
thing inside the truck.

1:09:30.731 --> 1:09:33.469
I like.

1:09:35.337 --> 1:09:37.706
It s like Live,
L.I.V.E spelled backwards.

1:09:37.738 --> 1:09:41.442
One sip of this wine is
guaranteed to send you back to

1:09:41.475 --> 1:09:44.246
your ancestors in 6 hours with
no trace of poisoning

1:09:44.279 --> 1:09:49.251
found during autopsy
because-all the ingredients

1:09:49.283 --> 1:09:54.255
are all organic. It s one of the
most fool proof ways of

1:09:54.288 --> 1:09:57.559
taking out an adversary in a
dinner or party scenario.

1:09:57.591 --> 1:10:00.761
The beauty of this is once it is
drunk it cannot be reversed

1:10:00.795 --> 1:10:04.533
by any other means, but
by its antidote Also, the

1:10:04.565 --> 1:10:08.302
symptoms are subtle and only
visible to the trained eye or

1:10:08.336 --> 1:10:11.506
such as sneezing, yawning,
itching your private parts

1:10:11.538 --> 1:10:13.774
which means you'll make excuses
to leave the party or dinner

1:10:13.807 --> 1:10:17.011
well on time to their demise
away from the place of

1:10:17.045 --> 1:10:18.780
poisoning.

1:10:19.546 --> 1:10:22.016
I like.

1:10:22.050 --> 1:10:23.719
Hey you!

1:10:23.752 --> 1:10:27.423
What you do today?

1:10:28.323 --> 1:10:31.627
You like to watch? Eh?
You like to watch.

1:10:31.659 --> 1:10:34.529
Go finish work.

1:10:35.596 --> 1:10:38.434
Move!

1:11:01.622 --> 1:11:04.292
We finish. We go back to camp.

1:11:04.326 --> 1:11:06.694
Back to camp?
But Bossman you promised.

1:11:07.228 --> 1:11:12.434
Promised, Bossman,
no promise anything.

1:11:21.743 --> 1:11:25.514
You no happy I let you go? Eh?

1:11:26.847 --> 1:11:30.519
You see my boys here, you know
what they wait?

1:11:30.551 --> 1:11:35.556
They wait my order,
who take turn first after me.

1:11:41.729 --> 1:11:46.500
But not today. Today,
Bossman let you go. Bossman

1:11:46.533 --> 1:11:51.539
very happy, very very
happy, get out!

1:11:59.747 --> 1:12:03.417
You still here? You no fear?

1:12:03.451 --> 1:12:04.752
Bossman you made
me a promise, but

1:12:04.786 --> 1:12:08.356
I guess you are not man
enough to keep it.

1:12:08.390 --> 1:12:10.859
Man enough?

1:12:17.931 --> 1:12:21.135
Infidel.

1:12:21.168 --> 1:12:24.372
Infidel, Bossman Man enough?

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:31.646
Bossman man enough,
even Ghetto my boy here, man

1:12:31.912 --> 1:12:36.918
enough. But Kunda district too
hot right now. Forget little

1:12:38.752 --> 1:12:39.554
man. Too risky.

1:12:39.587 --> 1:12:43.425
Too risky? So,
Bossman afraid now?

1:12:45.527 --> 1:12:50.532
Bossman fear? Bossman no fear
anybody. Bossman no fear

1:12:51.332 --> 1:12:55.904
anything. Everything fear
Bossman. Kunda District too hot.

1:12:55.936 --> 1:12:57.171
That s all woman.

1:12:57.204 --> 1:13:00.509
Is that all you re going to say?
Bossman you made me a promise

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:02.611
that you would send your boys to
go and fine Edwin should I

1:13:02.644 --> 1:13:05.579
honor my word by bringing you
here. But I guess you are not a

1:13:05.613 --> 1:13:06.847
man of honor either.

1:13:06.881 --> 1:13:11.552
Shut up, shut up woman. Who give
you right to talk to Bossman.

1:13:11.586 --> 1:13:14.189
You infidel,
Ghetto, finish this woman.

1:13:14.221 --> 1:13:16.759
If you kill me,
Bossman will die.

1:13:20.994 --> 1:13:22.963
What you say?

1:13:22.997 --> 1:13:27.836
I said you will die. In fact you
are already dying. You have less

1:13:28.837 --> 1:13:30.539
than 5 hours to live.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:33.708
Bossman, let me finish off
this witch now.

1:13:38.779 --> 1:13:43.585
You would do charm on
Bossman? Bossman no fear charm.

1:13:46.587 --> 1:13:50.024
You infidel. Black magic,

1:13:52.860 --> 1:13:55.697
Black magic no work on Bossman!

1:13:55.729 --> 1:13:59.734
It is not magic. It is poison.

1:14:03.671 --> 1:14:07.075
That drink, that s the poison.

1:14:09.577 --> 1:14:14.248
The the urge to sneeze, itching
in your private parts, those are

1:14:14.282 --> 1:14:18.619
all the symptoms and
no medicine can cure it.

1:14:22.556 --> 1:14:24.259
Come here, come here.

1:14:24.292 --> 1:14:28.831
Lick it, lick it, woman,
you die too witch.

1:14:30.765 --> 1:14:32.067
Where the antidote?

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:32.901
I don t know.

1:14:32.934 --> 1:14:35.270
You don't know. Here.

1:14:35.302 --> 1:14:38.773
Where the antidote,
or I kill you now.

1:14:38.805 --> 1:14:40.541
I said I don t know.

1:14:40.574 --> 1:14:43.545
No. Come here.

1:14:43.578 --> 1:14:48.517
I kill you. I kill you.
Where the antidote.

1:14:51.886 --> 1:14:54.856
I don t know but Edwin does.

1:15:01.328 --> 1:15:06.534
Listen woman, I kill you without
a blink. I ask you for the last

1:15:07.902 --> 1:15:12.875
time. Where the an where the
antidote?

1:15:13.408 --> 1:15:17.980
I don t know! Edwin.

1:15:20.681 --> 1:15:24.719
What, what do you want?

1:15:24.752 --> 1:15:28.557
Send your boys to find Edwin.

1:15:30.757 --> 1:15:35.764
Why? Why you want to die?

1:15:36.631 --> 1:15:41.837
You know you die because of
this? You know?

1:15:42.404 --> 1:15:45.774
Bossman, truly Edwin is the one
who has the antidote.

1:15:45.806 --> 1:15:49.010
He was more interested
in the poison and antidote gist

1:15:49.042 --> 1:15:51.947
when my boss was talking about
it. I didn't think much of it

1:15:51.979 --> 1:15:54.015
then, but please, he will help.

1:15:56.050 --> 1:15:58.653
You have less than 5 hours to
reverse this condition. I

1:15:58.685 --> 1:16:01.855
suggest you send your boys to go
and find Edwin and fast.

1:16:01.889 --> 1:16:06.895
Ghetto! Take men, go now.

1:16:07.060 --> 1:16:11.632
Find little man, let nothing
stop you. Bring him here now.

1:16:11.666 --> 1:16:16.672
You! Pray, pray little man get
antidote.

1:17:01.015 --> 1:17:06.021
Captain, this had
better be good. Risking the life of a

1:17:06.587 --> 1:17:10.192
Nigerian colonel like this.

1:17:10.725 --> 1:17:15.931
Sir what I am about to
reveal to you will change everything.

1:17:20.801 --> 1:17:22.436
What is this captain?

1:17:22.470 --> 1:17:24.673
You will find all the the
details in those documents,

1:17:24.706 --> 1:17:29.677
names and account details of all
who have been paid off. As I

1:17:29.711 --> 1:17:33.114
told you on the phone sir, this
whole thing is a charade and not

1:17:33.146 --> 1:17:37.685
an insurgency attack, rather a
spin off of an attempt to take

1:17:37.719 --> 1:17:41.456
out Major Egan who himself
believes Col. Bello wants him

1:17:41.488 --> 1:17:45.759
dead because of his wife but
it s bigger than that, Sir.

1:17:45.792 --> 1:17:49.963
Without realizing it, Major Egan
stumbled on some secret medical

1:17:49.997 --> 1:17:54.069
practices and plot by some
corrupt officers that could

1:17:54.101 --> 1:17:57.771
shake the military to its knees.

1:17:57.805 --> 1:18:00.475
Members of our military are
being used as guinea pigs in

1:18:00.507 --> 1:18:04.011
some secret experiments by
these corrupt soldiers and

1:18:04.045 --> 1:18:07.282
international pharmaceutical
companies who want to turn these

1:18:07.314 --> 1:18:11.018
soldiers into invincible super
human soldiers.

1:18:11.051 --> 1:18:15.956
The side effects of these
tests could be huge because

1:18:15.989 --> 1:18:19.993
these drugs have never been
tested before.

1:18:20.027 --> 1:18:22.997
Some senior officers have been
compromised, Sir,

1:18:23.029 --> 1:18:26.734
with large amounts paid into
their accounts. They are not

1:18:26.768 --> 1:18:30.204
only looking the other way, but
are willing to eliminate anyone

1:18:30.238 --> 1:18:32.307
who gets in their way.

1:18:32.340 --> 1:18:37.078
Captain, this is very serious.
Are you sure about this?

1:18:47.121 --> 1:18:51.893
You know, if this is true,
we will be going head on against

1:18:52.894 --> 1:18:57.198
very powerful people.

1:18:57.230 --> 1:19:01.034
Captain, you know what it means
to challenge a Nigerian

1:19:01.068 --> 1:19:05.840
Colonel?

1:19:05.872 --> 1:19:10.878
We are up the food chain and
we are very dangerous.

1:19:11.845 --> 1:19:15.916
especially to junior officers
who become a threat.

1:19:17.885 --> 1:19:19.820
That is why I am
counting on you, Sir.

1:19:19.854 --> 1:19:22.791
To use your good office to put
a stop to these people.

1:19:32.132 --> 1:19:34.402
How many people know about
this?

1:19:34.769 --> 1:19:37.105
Just you and I.

1:19:40.207 --> 1:19:45.079
Alright, let s keep it that
way for now, until I can confirm

1:19:47.081 --> 1:19:52.020
this thing. Meanwhile, Major
Egan, Captain David and that

1:19:55.288 --> 1:19:58.358
woman must come in.
Can you arrange that?

1:19:58.391 --> 1:20:00.295
Certainly.

1:20:00.328 --> 1:20:02.363
Good.

1:20:02.395 --> 1:20:07.301
Captain, this meeting never
happened. Dismissed.

1:20:09.036 --> 1:20:10.337
Sir.

1:20:46.274 --> 1:20:51.279
Little man, you get
antidote?

1:20:52.380 --> 1:20:54.282
What?

1:21:00.354 --> 1:21:05.159
Little man, I say you get
antidote, yes? No?

1:21:11.998 --> 1:21:15.469

Yes, yes he does, He has it.

1:21:19.472 --> 1:21:21.909

1:21:27.715 --> 1:21:29.217

Yes you do. Remember? Mr
Hammersmith told you the

1:21:32.153 --> 1:21:33.288
antidote for LIVE?

1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:34.956
What live?

1:21:34.988 --> 1:21:37.457

Oh oh the lethal drink.

1:21:40.293 --> 1:21:43.297
So you bring me antidote now!
Or she die.

1:21:43.331 --> 1:21:48.069
Look, it s really not exactly as
it looks. He didn't exactly

1:21:50.337 --> 1:21:52.306
mention the name of the
antidote in our conversation.

1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:54.309
All he did was drop hints.

1:21:54.341 --> 1:21:59.346
Hints, what hints? You know name
of antidote or no? Bossman die,

1:22:02.350 --> 1:22:07.322
you suffer slow death. Now, tell
me where is antidote?

figure out what he meant by LIVE

1:22:11.993 --> 1:22:14.195

1:29:44.944 --> 1:29:48.948
This sitting cannot continue to
wait indefinitely.

1:29:48.981 --> 1:29:51.618

1:30:18.945 --> 1:30:21.715
Adams What is the situation now?

1:30:21.747 --> 1:30:25.752
Our intel tracked them down now sir.

1:30:25.786 --> 1:30:30.890

your order to finish this.

1:30:30.923 --> 1:30:35.930

1:31:02.021 --> 1:31:04.559

1:31:08.729 --> 1:31:10.731
Lose them.

1:31:27.648 --> 1:31:28.949

1:31:28.981 --> 1:31:30.885
I am trying. We are up against

1:31:30.917 --> 1:31:33.787
machines here. This is no game!

1:32:40.787 --> 1:32:45.726
Gentlemen,
I will have to adjourn this preliminary

1:32:46.726 --> 1:32:50.697
hearing. Colonel Bissong.

1:32:50.730 --> 1:32:52.733
Sir.

1:32:53.100 --> 1:32:57.805
You can request for a
reschedule. I suggest you get

1:32:59.805 --> 1:33:04.611
your act together.

1:33:07.747 --> 1:33:11.217
This meeting is over.

1:33:42.815 --> 1:33:45.086
I'm sure they
will be here soon sir.

1:33:49.855 --> 1:33:53.726
If I were you Colonel, I
wouldn't' t bet on dead men as

1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:58.766
witnesses. Wasn't Major Egan
supposed to be dead and given a

1:33:59.132 --> 1:34:03.670
military funeral? And you think
you can bring him back from the

1:34:03.703 --> 1:34:08.675
dead? I don't think so.
Good day Colonel.

1:34:21.087 --> 1:34:23.858
Regina.

1:34:55.889 --> 1:34:58.225
Oh, thank goodness for a
second there I thought I had

1:34:58.257 --> 1:35:00.161
lost you.

1:35:03.195 --> 1:35:06.733
And have me making headlines
tomorrow?

1:35:06.766 --> 1:35:09.135
Can we go now?

1:35:10.069 --> 1:35:12.872
You're still alive?

1:35:33.025 --> 1:35:37.764
Sir, good news, we still
have our witnesses even though their

1:35:38.564 --> 1:35:40.900
assailants now think that
they are dead.

1:35:40.934 --> 1:35:44.538
What? That's excellent.

1:35:44.570 --> 1:35:45.572
Yes Sir.

1:35:45.605 --> 1:35:49.809
This buys us some
time to get our act together

1:35:49.842 --> 1:35:54.814
before the next hearing.
Let everybody believe

1:35:54.847 --> 1:35:58.318
that they are dead.
Captain, am I clear on this?

1:35:58.350 --> 1:35:59.551
Yes, Sir.

1:35:59.586 --> 1:36:03.824
Good, Let our enemies think
that they are dead, until the

1:36:03.856 --> 1:36:08.863
time is right for our boys to
return from the dead.

1:36:18.171 --> 1:36:20.807
There it is!
The green white green flag.

1:36:20.841 --> 1:36:23.210
And it is still
flying, thank goodness.

1:36:23.243 --> 1:36:26.146
Edwin this is it,
let s go for it!

1:36:36.288 --> 1:36:39.926
Help! We are West Africans!

1:36:41.927 --> 1:36:44.864
You made it, you made it.

1:36:44.898 --> 1:36:48.268
Don t worry you are
safe now. You are safe.

1:36:48.301 --> 1:36:51.305
We'll get you inside.
