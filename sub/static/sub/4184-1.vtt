WEBVTT

02:34.361 --> 02:36.696
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

02:36.696 --> 02:39.116
Man down! Cease fire!

02:44.037 --> 02:46.498
Stupid motherfucker!

04:06.119 --> 04:07.287
Sí.

06:36.686 --> 06:39.189
What's up, Sylvia?

06:43.860 --> 06:46.113
Cute little outfit.

06:46.113 --> 06:47.697
You look nice.

06:47.781 --> 06:48.698
Mike's in the bedroom.

06:48.782 --> 06:49.783
Yeah?

06:52.702 --> 06:56.790
Man, I said you look nice.

06:56.790 --> 06:59.543
I have a court appearance, Jim.

06:59.626 --> 07:01.711
Well, you just give 'em hell.

07:04.214 --> 07:08.051
Hey.

07:08.135 --> 07:10.137
Spiffy duds, huh?

07:11.638 --> 07:13.473
You look like a gift-Wrapped turd.

07:13.473 --> 07:15.308
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

07:15.308 --> 07:17.144
I have two filings and
a deposition today.

07:17.144 --> 07:18.812
Play nice, kids.

07:20.814 --> 07:21.815
What up, dog?

07:21.898 --> 07:23.900
Nothing. Just got back. Cool. Cool.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.402
How was Mexico, dog?

07:25.485 --> 07:27.821
Oh, it was a dream, man.

07:29.489 --> 07:30.907
Loving my woman. Right.

07:30.991 --> 07:32.659
That's it. I'm out of here.

07:32.659 --> 07:35.495
Those are copies of your resumé.

07:35.495 --> 07:36.580
Pass them out like candy.

07:36.663 --> 07:37.998
'Cause I can always print up more.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.833
And just call me if
anything happens, okay?

07:41.251 --> 07:42.669
And no drinking.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.172
Come on, baby, be cool.

07:45.255 --> 07:46.423
Honey, I'm serious.

07:46.506 --> 07:48.592
No drinking. Okay?

07:48.592 --> 07:50.927
I love you. I love you, too.

07:52.429 --> 07:55.098
Good luck.

07:57.017 --> 07:58.351
Your suit's fine, okay?

08:03.273 --> 08:06.026
Dude, she called me a
gift-Wrapped turd.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.612
Don't be fucking with
her, dude.

08:08.695 --> 08:10.447
She's pissed.

08:10.447 --> 08:11.948
Why is she on the warpath?
Dog...

08:13.116 --> 08:15.035
I didn't look for work yesterday, dude.

08:15.118 --> 08:17.871
Sold some of her CDs, bought
a couple of 40s

08:17.871 --> 08:19.706
and a pack of GPCs.

08:19.706 --> 08:20.874
Caught a buzz and watched

08:20.957 --> 08:22.876
My Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.128
That's on you, homie.

08:25.128 --> 08:27.380
We didn't even hang yesterday.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.882
I was out of the country.

08:28.965 --> 08:30.884
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

08:30.926 --> 08:32.135
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

08:32.219 --> 08:34.137
Come on, dude, let's
get the fuck out of here

08:34.221 --> 08:35.388
And find my ass some employment.

08:35.388 --> 08:36.807
It's cool you driving me around?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.391
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

08:42.062 --> 08:43.230
Here, asshole.

08:43.230 --> 08:44.564
Breakfast.

08:44.564 --> 08:46.400
Oh... ho, ho...

08:46.400 --> 08:48.235
Dog.

08:48.318 --> 08:50.237
No pisto for me, dude.

08:50.237 --> 08:52.406
Today's a no-Pounding
day. You heard the woman.

08:52.489 --> 08:54.241
Good. More for me.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.745
Fuck it.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.581
Salud. Salud.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.753
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.588
I can't pay my rent.

09:08.588 --> 09:11.591
Landlady's about to
pull a gauge on my ass.

09:11.591 --> 09:14.094
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

09:14.177 --> 09:17.013
The tax-Free shit?

09:17.097 --> 09:19.850
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.601
I guess we drank up the rest.

09:21.601 --> 09:23.270
Dumb ass.

09:24.604 --> 09:26.440
Cops better start paying you, dude.

09:26.481 --> 09:27.941
You spend enough fucking time with them.

09:27.983 --> 09:30.360
They better start kicking
me down some paychecks, man.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.529
They got me hopping
through hoops, you know?

09:32.612 --> 09:34.865
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

09:34.948 --> 09:36.700
Another test, another two weeks.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.201
Fuck.

09:38.285 --> 09:39.286
Shit gets real,

09:39.327 --> 09:40.620
You be hating life.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.622
Party time will be over.

09:42.706 --> 09:45.375
Dude, you don't know how much

09:45.417 --> 09:47.461
I'm looking forward to this shit.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.796
You know, I'll be super recruit.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.673
I was jumping out of choppers

09:51.715 --> 09:52.966
In the mountains, taking down

09:53.008 --> 09:55.969
Hard motherfuckers, you know?

09:56.011 --> 09:58.722
I'll be laughing my way
through LAPD's reindeer games.

09:58.805 --> 10:01.475
Shit, they're gonna love me.

10:01.516 --> 10:03.810
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.896
Ah, fuck you.

10:05.979 --> 10:08.315
I'm going to love my old lady.

10:08.356 --> 10:10.150
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.819
Import her ass.

10:12.819 --> 10:14.321
Oh, come on, man.

10:14.404 --> 10:15.822
Dude, what happened to all the honeys

10:15.822 --> 10:17.616
We were gonna pimp with
your badge, dog?

10:17.657 --> 10:18.658
You're fucking up the plan.

10:18.658 --> 10:21.078
I've been thinking, you know?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.330
Love's about sacrifice.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.374
Only true measure of it.

10:26.374 --> 10:27.918
What would you do for Sylvia?

10:30.420 --> 10:31.588
Get a job.

10:31.588 --> 10:33.507
Mm... Nine to fucking five.

10:33.548 --> 10:35.342
Yeah.

10:35.342 --> 10:36.843
That's love.

10:48.188 --> 10:49.773
Hey.

10:54.277 --> 10:57.781
Good morning.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.202
So when do you officially

11:02.285 --> 11:03.954
hand your ass over to the Man?

11:04.037 --> 11:07.874
"Mr. Jim Davis, we regret to inform...

11:10.168 --> 11:12.295
I had two beers, right?

11:12.295 --> 11:13.713
Yeah.

11:13.755 --> 11:15.048
Going fucking blind or something.

11:15.048 --> 11:17.050
Okay, this letter says, quoting...

11:17.092 --> 11:22.389
"No longer eligible as a
police officer candidate."

11:22.389 --> 11:24.933
What the fuck does that mean?

11:24.975 --> 11:26.977
Come on, dude.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.646
"No longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

11:29.646 --> 11:30.897
They pulled the plug, dude.

11:30.897 --> 11:34.985
No, no...

11:35.068 --> 11:36.528
Why?

11:36.570 --> 11:39.906
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

11:39.948 --> 11:41.992
I'll bet you it's 'cause I'm white.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.161
I bet it's 'cause you're a dick.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.912
No, no, no, Mike, you don't understand.

11:45.912 --> 11:47.748
I am fucked.

11:47.831 --> 11:49.750
I got to get married.

11:49.791 --> 11:53.754
Okay? INS won't let
me bring Marta across

11:53.837 --> 11:55.172
Unless I got employment.

11:55.255 --> 11:56.256
I promised her.

11:56.339 --> 11:58.091
This fucks up my plan.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.427
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

12:00.510 --> 12:02.929
This... these fucking assholes...

12:03.013 --> 12:06.266
These fucking assholes!

12:06.349 --> 12:07.934
What the fuck is their problem, man?!

12:08.018 --> 12:13.023
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

12:13.106 --> 12:14.941
Yo, yo, fucking chill, Magilla Gorilla.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.359
I mean you're trippin', dude.

12:16.359 --> 12:17.444
Hey, what the fuck

12:17.527 --> 12:18.695
Are you looking at, asshole?!

12:18.695 --> 12:21.448
Fucking dick.

12:21.448 --> 12:22.449
Yo, yo,

12:22.491 --> 12:24.534
Jim, Jim...

12:24.618 --> 12:26.953
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

12:28.121 --> 12:29.456
You fucking want some?

12:29.456 --> 12:32.709
Jim, Jim, dude.

12:32.709 --> 12:33.960
Kick back, dude.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.630
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.964
Man, fuck. You're going to catch

12:37.964 --> 12:39.132
A case doing that shit, man.

12:39.132 --> 12:40.383
What the fuck were you doing?

12:40.383 --> 12:42.219
Fuck the LAPD, man.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.221
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

12:44.304 --> 12:46.139
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.141
L.A. City's the shit.

12:48.141 --> 12:49.810
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

12:49.893 --> 12:52.479
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

12:52.479 --> 12:56.733
Yeah, Sheriff's Department, yeah.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.986
They make you work the
jails the first two years

13:00.070 --> 13:01.071
Or something.

13:01.154 --> 13:02.489
I could be cracking heads

13:02.489 --> 13:04.324
Up at the Honor Ranch.

13:04.324 --> 13:07.661
I'll give 'em a call, start testing.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.830
Yeah.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.248
That's right.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.167
Yo, it's just a minor setback, right?

13:14.167 --> 13:16.586
Quit trippin', dude.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.755
Shit.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.925
Hey, you know what I want to do?

13:22.008 --> 13:23.510
What?

13:23.510 --> 13:26.513
I want to get fucked up.

13:26.596 --> 13:28.181
Me, too, man.

13:28.181 --> 13:31.017
I got to find a job and
placate my baby, you know.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.853
Sylvia's going to kick your ass?

13:32.936 --> 13:34.521
Come on, big man, she'll be cool.

13:34.604 --> 13:37.274
Come on.

13:45.615 --> 13:48.368
Bye, Nicole. Bye.

13:51.204 --> 13:55.876
Let me get a couple of
singles, too, please.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.878
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

13:57.961 --> 13:59.796
Be cool, dude.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.047
If I buy a whole pack

14:01.047 --> 14:02.716
I'm gonna want to smoke it.

14:02.799 --> 14:05.051
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

14:05.051 --> 14:06.803
City give me $1,500 ticket.

14:06.803 --> 14:07.804
No more.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.245
Asshole.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.185
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.603
Oh, shit.

14:56.603 --> 14:58.355
That fucking gangster, man.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.191
Homeboy just ran a
six second four-Forty.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.944
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.862
You think we'll be
able to go back there?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.697
I hate that shit.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.617
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

15:10.617 --> 15:12.619
Come on, dude. We're wearin' suits, man.

15:12.702 --> 15:13.954
We totally look like cops.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.622
He said he got fined for that shit.

15:15.705 --> 15:16.873
He was just being cautious.

15:16.873 --> 15:21.211
Well, we got pisto, we got frajos.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.296
Only one thing missin'.

15:23.296 --> 15:25.132
Be-At-Ches.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.801
Oh, yeah, I mean besides bitches, man.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.137
Yesca? Mm-Hmm.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.805
Bingo.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.141
I need to feel some reefer madness.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.977
You sure you want to
score some bud, dude?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.146
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

15:39.146 --> 15:42.733
I said I want to get fucked up, man.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.484
Fuck this purity bullshit.

15:44.484 --> 15:48.905
Yeah... fuck purity.

15:48.989 --> 15:53.493
Aw, man, look at this zero-Head, dog.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.661
Stupid-Ass cholo.

15:54.661 --> 15:55.996
Look at that.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.332
That dude's slangin', dog.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.753
Want to get a dime?

16:02.753 --> 16:05.922
No, I want it all.

16:12.095 --> 16:14.014
Go for the stash, man.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.356
Whoa, go, go, go.

16:23.356 --> 16:25.025
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

16:25.108 --> 16:27.194
That's my shit!

16:27.277 --> 16:28.945
Fuck.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.365
Outstanding.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.534
Out-Fucking-Standing.

16:34.534 --> 16:35.952
That shit was slick.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.038
That motherfucker just got schooled.

16:38.121 --> 16:40.123
Bitch-Ass cholo.

16:40.123 --> 16:41.708
Check this shit out, huh? Yeah.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.044
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.880
Mm. It's not laced either.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.881
Smell that shit.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.049
Smell that motherfucking shit.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.134
We just burned my car.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.886
We go back there, we're gonna get shot.

16:52.969 --> 16:53.887
Yeah, no shit.

16:53.970 --> 16:54.888
Man, bust that light.

16:54.971 --> 16:56.723
Roll that shit up.

16:56.723 --> 16:58.725
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.477
Yo, let's drop off some resumés first.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.728
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

17:01.728 --> 17:02.896
Some resumés.

17:02.979 --> 17:04.064
Yeah.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.233
Ah, man, fresh air.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.401
Look.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.319
Oh! They're dropped off, man.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.570
You fucking asshole, man.

17:10.570 --> 17:11.905
I got to get a fucking job, man.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.240
What's your problem, man?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.574
What the fuck are you doing, dickhead.

17:14.574 --> 17:15.742
Yo, Mike, first
day looking--

17:15.742 --> 17:18.412
Nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

17:18.412 --> 17:22.082
Come on, don't sweat it, man.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.252
Hey, I can't fuck around tomorrow.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.503
I got to get a job for sure.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.754
This is your job, man.

17:27.754 --> 17:29.172
So act like a fucking professional,

17:29.172 --> 17:31.341
Spark up the goods, 'cause
we got a lot of work to do.

17:40.767 --> 17:43.687
It's harsh. It's good, though.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.365
You okay?

17:55.365 --> 17:57.367
How are those lungs, baby?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.119
There it is.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.788
That magic feeling.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.728
Damn, look at that bitch.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.480
Oh, damn.

18:29.232 --> 18:32.736
Fuck, yeah.

18:32.819 --> 18:34.321
She's fucking good.

18:34.362 --> 18:36.990
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.160
You just saw your woman.

18:40.243 --> 18:41.661
Only hit her once, man.

18:41.661 --> 18:45.082
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

18:45.082 --> 18:49.836
Family's got that ass under guard, huh?

18:49.878 --> 18:51.004
Lock and key.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.840
Fuck, I want to get laid.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.010
Pay a visit to my harem, huh?

18:57.010 --> 18:58.178
Online, pornmeister.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.805
Uh-Uh, let's go to Letty's pad, man.

18:59.846 --> 19:01.681
How much you want to bet I hit it.

19:01.681 --> 19:03.517
She won't, dog. How
much you want to bet?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.893
She won't give you shit, dog.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.520
You big time fucked her over.

19:06.561 --> 19:09.314
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.567
I got that mind control, man.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.196
How much you want to
bet I get back up in it?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.697
20 bucks?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.032
You ain't got 20 bucks.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.034
So, neither do you, man.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.869
Come on, shake on that shit.

19:22.869 --> 19:25.288
Come on.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.624
What the fuck, let's go.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.293
I got it.

19:31.294 --> 19:32.921
What's up, Patty?

19:32.963 --> 19:35.882
Y tu hermana? She ain't here.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.467
Y sabes que?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.553
You're not welcome in this house.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.722
Sure, Patty.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.891
I'd love to come in.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.644
Thank you.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.896
Are they here?

19:53.900 --> 19:58.196
You're looking fine, as fuck, chulas.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.407
Don't... don't touch me, please.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.076
Hey, hey.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.747
You got to get out of here.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.749
Letty...

20:08.749 --> 20:11.918
I just wanted to see you again.

20:15.338 --> 20:17.924
Hey, Patty, you want to
grab me a pisto or something?

20:17.924 --> 20:19.968
I ain't grabbing you shit.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.344
Oh, you still got a mouth, huh?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.430
Maybe one day you'll
learn how to keep it shut.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.683
Laters. I'm going to my room.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.978
You know you have to
run his ass out of here.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.608
Baby.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.946
Let's sit down.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.040
No, no, no.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.127
So, um...

20:54.211 --> 20:56.046
You a cop yet?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.631
I'm working on it.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.966
Y tu?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.969
Que andas haciendo?

21:02.969 --> 21:05.388
Well, you know, I'm
going to L.A. Trade Tech.

21:05.388 --> 21:08.058
It's good you're doing positive shit.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.406
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

21:22.406 --> 21:26.159
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.328
Oh, come on, come here.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.581
Yeah.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.421
Don't.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.173
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.008
Who?

21:42.050 --> 21:44.344
Flaco.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.345
You're back with that

21:45.345 --> 21:47.681
Piece of shit after what he did, Letty?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.184
You're not fucking him, are you?

21:51.184 --> 21:53.520
Please tell me no.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.356
Yes. So... just go.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.191
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.695
See?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.029
Okay?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.865
I don't believe this shit, Letty.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.700
You're too good for that.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.041
You gotta go.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.877
Go. Please!

22:16.960 --> 22:18.044
Let me talk to them.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.046
No, Jim, don't be stupid. Please.

22:20.046 --> 22:24.384
Okay? Largate. Just go.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.475
I guess it's later days.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.904
Largate. Just go!

22:43.987 --> 22:46.448
Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!

22:46.490 --> 22:48.742
Apuarte, Jim! Hurry up!

22:48.742 --> 22:50.827
Fuck him up! I got him!

23:10.263 --> 23:12.766
Fucking white boy!

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
What's up, faggot?!

23:17.604 --> 23:20.440
We're going to fuck you up!

23:25.362 --> 23:26.279
Yo! Pop the trunk

23:26.279 --> 23:27.531
So I can handle this shit!

23:27.531 --> 23:29.282
Fuck you, puto!

23:29.282 --> 23:30.951
I'll bust you!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.953
Leave him alone!

23:33.036 --> 23:36.957
Pop the fucking trunk!

23:53.640 --> 23:55.809
Jim!

23:57.477 --> 23:59.479
Oh, you fucked up!

23:59.479 --> 24:01.648
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

24:01.732 --> 24:03.316
Get the fuck over there, man!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.318
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

24:05.318 --> 24:06.486
What's your problem, Flaco?

24:06.486 --> 24:09.489
Motherfucker!

24:09.489 --> 24:11.491
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

24:11.491 --> 24:14.911
That's right!

24:14.995 --> 24:18.999
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

24:19.082 --> 24:21.585
You deaf fuck!

24:25.255 --> 24:26.423
Yo, Mike.

24:26.506 --> 24:27.758
Yeah?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.176
Do up their ride.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.095
Freeze, bitch!

24:32.179 --> 24:35.098
I'm going to take that
big ass of yours home,

24:35.182 --> 24:37.350
Hit it for a minute, you know?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.685
Fuck off!

24:38.685 --> 24:39.686
Now you got it.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.691
Yo, relax, homie.

24:46.026 --> 24:50.030
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.198
Fuck!

24:53.784 --> 24:55.869
Hey, haina.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.037
Whoo!

24:57.037 --> 24:58.622
Fuck off! Oh, yeah?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.540
What you got down here?

25:00.624 --> 25:02.125
Oh...

25:02.209 --> 25:03.710
Liking that.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.801
Damn! Those are badass kicks, dog.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.720
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

25:13.720 --> 25:16.139
Else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.058
Fuck you, puto. Huh?

25:18.058 --> 25:19.726
Yeah. Fuck you. Yes?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.564
You fucking stay still!

25:24.564 --> 25:26.900
Bitches! If you didn't
have that fucking gun,

25:26.900 --> 25:29.486
Ese, it wouldn't be about shit, homie.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.405
Not fucking shit!

25:31.405 --> 25:33.907
Hey, later, Patty!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.742
I hope you're not pregnant, but you know

25:35.826 --> 25:36.910
You wanted me to blow in you.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.078
Fuck you!

25:38.078 --> 25:39.746
Bye, Letty!

25:47.504 --> 25:48.839
Salud.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.173
Salud.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.513
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.276
I know I got more than that.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.363
Yeah. Here we go.

26:13.447 --> 26:14.698
Shit.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.950
That's my pussy she's giving away there.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.704
Homeboy uses extra large.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.456
Man, that's it? Next time,

26:22.539 --> 26:24.124
Jack someone with a job.

26:24.124 --> 26:27.794
Well, fuck you. What
did you get, their lunch?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.546
Check it out.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.632
Holy shit. You're kidding me.

26:37.637 --> 26:41.975
Whoo! It's a fucking Ruger
P-94. Nine millimeter.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.895
14, plus one in the chamber.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.646
It's a good fucking gun. Durable.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.482
It's brand-New.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.569
It's a BB gun.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.987
Yeah. Cool.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.655
Here you go, dog.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.990
About time you got a cohete.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.492
No. I don't want it.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.827
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.829
That's a good reason. Sell it.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.915
How much you think we
can get for the gun?

27:04.998 --> 27:07.667
Two bills, maybe three. Costs six new.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.836
We'll sell it and split the greenery.

27:09.836 --> 27:10.837
You sure?

27:10.837 --> 27:12.506
It's cool, dude.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.091
50-50.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.761
Good BB gun though.

27:17.844 --> 27:20.347
Shoot some birds and shit.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.182
Hey, put that shit away.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.683
Looks real as hell.

27:24.935 --> 27:26.019
Not a bad day's work.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.534
Get down to business though.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.036
I know you didn't get any.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.538
So pay up, motherfucker.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.544
Dick.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.384
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

27:57.384 --> 28:02.222
This is Bob Luell at
the Palm Glen Group.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.307
We have reviewed your resumé,

28:04.307 --> 28:07.060
And would like to make an appointment

28:07.144 --> 28:08.478
For later in the week.

28:08.562 --> 28:09.646
Please call me at your

28:09.730 --> 28:11.481
Earliest convenience.

28:11.565 --> 28:12.482
Thank you.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.818
Huh? That's good.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.403
One more? This is fun.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.572
Sounded a little gay, but it was good.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.742
No, no, no. No. That's
it, dude. That's it.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.910
I get too many callbacks,

28:23.910 --> 28:25.162
Sylvia's going to get suspicious.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.830
Oh, Sylvia's going to
be kissing your ass.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.248
Not if she recognizes your voice.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.250
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.918
No, no, no, no, no. I'm cool.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.420
Come on. I'm cool.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.922
I want to get home before
the little woman and sober up.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
Come on, bro. One brew.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.260
All right, but hey,

28:40.343 --> 28:42.179
I got to look for a
job tomorrow for sure.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.430
Okay? I can't be getting fucked up

28:43.430 --> 28:44.514
Behind Sylvia's back when I'm supposed

28:44.598 --> 28:45.599
To be looking for work, man.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.350
Not cool. Tomorrow, for sure.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.436
I got to find a job, too.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.193
Hello.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.031
Yes, sir.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.118
Yes, sir. That is correct.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.620
Six years.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.872
Honorably discharged.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.624
Yes, sir.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.459
I would love to.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.545
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.632
Tomorrow

29:18.632 --> 29:21.551
Is not a problem.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.887
Thank you, sir. You
have a good day, too.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.640
Good-Bye, sir.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.892
That was the man, huh? You're all "Sir,

29:28.975 --> 29:30.310
Sir, sir."

29:30.394 --> 29:34.481
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

29:38.652 --> 29:40.821
That was the man! That
was the Federal man!

29:40.821 --> 29:43.407
The Federal man!

29:43.407 --> 29:44.658
Department of Homeland Security

29:44.741 --> 29:46.576
Wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

29:46.576 --> 29:49.496
Oh, shit!

29:49.579 --> 29:50.831
Fucking A, my brother!

29:50.831 --> 29:52.165
That shit is righteous, motherfucker!

29:52.165 --> 29:53.417
It's on, homie!

29:53.417 --> 29:55.085
Wow, man. Tomorrow.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.837
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.422
I got to take a piss test.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.840
If I'm cool, I'm in the house.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.346
Yeah! Oh!

30:06.430 --> 30:09.850
Shit, dude, do they piss test for weed?

30:09.850 --> 30:12.519
Oh, shit!

30:15.272 --> 30:16.773
You fucked up, man.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.692
Oh, fuck.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.112
I fucked up.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.698
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.117
Fuck! Oh...

30:27.200 --> 30:30.203
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.706
And they will burn me

30:32.706 --> 30:35.292
With every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.543
Shit!

30:36.543 --> 30:37.878
Wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.298
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.216
Hey, there's a way out of
every fucking situation.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.719
Right? Relax, dude. Yeah, yeah.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.221
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

30:48.221 --> 30:49.389
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.474
I'll pass that shit.

30:50.557 --> 30:51.892
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.311
Of course you will, dude!

30:54.311 --> 30:57.230
Later, loco.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.565
Don't fucking trip, dude.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.483
All right.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.485
Shit.

31:07.824 --> 31:08.742
Eat.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.828
Come in, dumb ass!

31:16.500 --> 31:17.751
What's up, dog?

31:17.834 --> 31:18.752
What up, dog...

31:18.835 --> 31:21.588
Hey, Jim. Want some coffee?

31:21.671 --> 31:22.672
Sure.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.508
Want some eggs? There's extra.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.760
Yes, ma'am. Please.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.763
I, uh, heard about the LAPD.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.681
Sorry about that.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.600
I thought they guaranteed you a job.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.185
Yea. Me, too.

31:35.185 --> 31:38.855
Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.608
You know, you being a cop.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.278
Tell her what's up, dude.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.613
Well, I applied

31:46.613 --> 31:49.699
To all the Federal law
enforcement agencies.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.034
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

31:51.118 --> 31:52.536
ICE, Homeland Security, all of them.

31:52.536 --> 31:55.288
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.874
They want me to come in
today and start testing.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.377
Wow. That's great. How sure is this?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.129
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.381
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

32:04.381 --> 32:06.383
And then I could be
out of here next month.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.301
You haven't been smoking out, have you?

32:08.301 --> 32:12.055
Nah. Chilled on that shit a while back.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.307
Good. Well, thanks for
driving Mike around yesterday.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.226
Yeah, sure. Yeah, bro.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.228
Three callbacks.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.897
Damn! Good!

32:20.897 --> 32:23.650
We dropped off enough resumés. Whoo!

32:23.734 --> 32:25.152
Got more.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.153
Yeah! Yeah!

32:26.236 --> 32:27.738
Well, you have to keep trying

32:27.821 --> 32:29.322
Until something happens.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.824
Finding a job is a job, right?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.159
Lunch money.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.410
Thank you.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.745
And good luck today.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.663
Thank you.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.165
Love you. I love you, too.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.000
Good luck.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.419
And, Jim, good luck on your pee test.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.670
I hope you studied.

32:45.505 --> 32:49.092
I'm going to cram for it.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.511
Man, that's freaky.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.597
She was in a good mood.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.098
Breakfast and beer money?

32:55.098 --> 32:56.099
Yeah, dude.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.518
She heard the messages last night.

32:58.518 --> 32:59.686
She got me a sixer.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.354
I slammed two last night.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.023
Out-Fuckin'-Standing!

33:03.106 --> 33:04.691
Now we know beer is
just a phone call away.

33:04.775 --> 33:05.942
Yeah.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.695
Yeah. We talked shit
out last night, though.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.948
You know? Hey, all she
wants is for me to get a job.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.868
I shouldn't be playing her like that.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.288
Dude, you had a good job,

33:18.288 --> 33:20.957
With that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.542
Had, dude. Had.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.795
All right? All that shit's in India now.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.463
Want a cold one? No, later.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.714
You got any vinegar?

33:27.798 --> 33:30.217
Vinegar? What for?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.224
Ah...

33:37.224 --> 33:39.226
Oh...

33:39.226 --> 33:40.310
Damn, dude!

33:40.310 --> 33:41.478
Ah...!

33:42.729 --> 33:44.231
Man! That is fuckin' sick, man.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.233
What'd you do that for?

33:46.233 --> 33:47.734
Shuts down the old kidneys. Ooh.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.736
Come on, let's roll.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.246
Grab me that bag, dude.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.422
Little trick I learned in the service.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.760
Aw, that's sick, dude.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.430
You're gonna stick a
turkey baster in your dick?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.099
Quit looking, faggot.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.935
You wish.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.360
Oh, man.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.695
Fuckin'...

34:31.695 --> 34:33.280
Shit, dude.

34:33.363 --> 34:34.364
Oh, fuckin' shit...

34:34.448 --> 34:36.032
Aw...

34:37.451 --> 34:39.119
Aw, motherfucker!

34:42.372 --> 34:44.124
Whew!

34:44.124 --> 34:45.625
Ah...

34:50.130 --> 34:52.048
That was...

34:52.048 --> 34:54.718
Unpleasant.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.475
Man...

35:03.226 --> 35:05.562
Man, I want to get this shit over with.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.898
You know, my teeth are floating.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.568
Oh...

35:11.568 --> 35:14.154
You get those in the military, dog?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.406
I was a Ranger.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.575
Your mom still suck a mean dick, hmm?

35:18.658 --> 35:20.327
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.912
Why don't you go fuck yourself!

35:21.995 --> 35:23.080
Hey!

35:23.080 --> 35:24.498
Let's play nice,

35:24.498 --> 35:26.083
Boys.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.169
I have everyone's "Consent
to Urinalysis" form signed

35:29.169 --> 35:30.253
And dated, am I right?

35:30.337 --> 35:31.254
Yes, sir.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.256
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.925
Jackets off.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.094
I will now administer the easiest test

35:37.094 --> 35:39.096
Homeland Security will ever give you,

35:39.179 --> 35:40.514
The whizz quiz.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.933
Roll up both sleeves past the elbow.

35:44.184 --> 35:49.189
Remove all gloves,
rings, watches, bracelets,

35:49.189 --> 35:53.527
Jewelry, Band-Aids and bandages.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.114
I want to see nothing but
bare hands and forearms.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.699
Wiggle your fingers.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.452
Let me see both sides.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.287
Beautifully done.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.415
Again, gentlemen, no talking.

36:06.415 --> 36:07.707
Detweiler, is it?

36:07.707 --> 36:09.626
You're with me.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.391
Fucker.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.565
Next!

36:35.402 --> 36:36.653
Name?

36:36.653 --> 36:38.822
Davis, Jim.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.490
Ah, the Ranger.

36:40.574 --> 36:41.908
Yes, sir.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.911
You serve? 101st.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.414
High speed. All right.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.332
Think you can fill that, son?

36:49.332 --> 36:52.043
I could fill a goddamn trash can, sir.

36:52.085 --> 36:55.088
You're full of piss and
vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

36:55.088 --> 36:57.257
Yes, sir.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.513
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

37:03.597 --> 37:05.265
I don't want my head blown off

37:05.307 --> 37:06.641
Just when I'm getting it straight.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.854
Pop! What's it like

37:10.937 --> 37:12.355
To just straight-Up
whack a motherfucker?

37:12.439 --> 37:15.484
What's it like? I mean,
what the fuck, you know?

37:15.525 --> 37:18.028
It's like nothing. What's
it supposed to be like?

37:18.111 --> 37:19.404
You tell me.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.740
You were busting heads for the military.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.284
I can't talk about this shit, Mike.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.874
But I will tell you one
thing-You point and shoot,

37:30.957 --> 37:33.710
Pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

37:33.752 --> 37:35.295
You move the fuck on.

37:35.295 --> 37:39.299
You do not stop and think about it.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.551
It's not a big deal. So if it's nothing,

37:41.635 --> 37:42.969
Then what you getting all mad for?

37:43.053 --> 37:44.179
I'm not getting mad.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.639
I just hate stupid questions, Mike.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.808
You think you killed a lot of Commies?

37:47.808 --> 37:49.893
They weren't Commies, dumb
ass. Then what were they?

37:49.976 --> 37:52.312
You know what they were--
They were fuckin' Hajjis,

37:52.312 --> 37:54.856
Terrorists, the bad guys.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.901
Did you like it? Oh, shit.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.903
Did you dig it?

37:59.986 --> 38:02.322
You bust a nut?

38:03.824 --> 38:06.159
Not fuckin' now, man. Seriously.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.830
You're killing my buzz, dude.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.332
Aw, kick back, stress case.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.668
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

38:14.751 --> 38:15.836
Hell, yeah.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.254
Let's sell this fuckin' piece.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.881
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

38:19.881 --> 38:20.674
Pop! Pop! Pop!

38:33.770 --> 38:35.522
Yo, Darrel!

38:35.522 --> 38:38.191
Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

38:39.776 --> 38:41.027
Darrel!

38:41.111 --> 38:43.321
Come on, come on, come
on, wake up and fuckin'

38:43.363 --> 38:44.948
Shine!

38:49.870 --> 38:52.998
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.460
Hey, what's up, bro?

38:58.295 --> 38:59.755
Come on in, motherfuckers.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.214
Yeah.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.049
Get your little ass up in here.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.176
Shit!

39:05.552 --> 39:07.387
Oh, man...

39:07.387 --> 39:09.723
Y'all scared the fuck out of me, man.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.310
You motherfuckers got ties on.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.228
I saw that city-Lookin'
car pull up--

39:15.312 --> 39:17.397
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

39:19.483 --> 39:20.859
I just got out of County.

39:20.901 --> 39:24.237
$9,600. No shit. When?

39:24.237 --> 39:26.073
Yesterday.

39:26.073 --> 39:27.741
Damn. What'd they put on you?

39:27.741 --> 39:28.700
Some bullshit.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.911
I saw some wrong-Ass shit

39:30.911 --> 39:32.162
Up in there, dude.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.331
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

39:34.414 --> 39:35.916
It scared you straight, huh?

39:35.916 --> 39:38.585
Mm-Hmm. Hey, you
get booty-Played?

39:40.670 --> 39:41.922
Hell, no.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.007
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

39:44.091 --> 39:46.510
They-They put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

39:46.593 --> 39:48.512
You toss the salad?
Hey, you know, nigga,

39:48.595 --> 39:52.349
I kept my ass to the
wall and my mouth shut.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.600
Shoot.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.811
I almost lost my job over that shit.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.437
Fuckin' around in there.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.859
Oh, God...

40:02.943 --> 40:04.694
You a cop? Nope.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.488
Rejected his ass.

40:06.488 --> 40:07.614
Fuck you.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.199
I'm getting in the Feds' car.

40:09.282 --> 40:12.369
Damn...!

40:12.369 --> 40:14.704
That's what I'm talking about!

40:14.788 --> 40:16.623
Ah, you hear that?

40:16.665 --> 40:19.209
This motherfucker gonna be a Fed.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.086
Yeah.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.296
You been wanting that shit, too.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.257
It's my dream, dude.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.092
So, you gonna do that shit right,

40:27.134 --> 40:30.137
Or, you know, you gonna do
a little shit on the side?

40:30.137 --> 40:32.305
I'm gonna get my own thing going.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.891
You know, I'll be flipping
shit, make a little money.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.310
You know?

40:37.394 --> 40:41.148
This motherfucker gonna have shit wired.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.483
Scary, huh?

40:44.901 --> 40:48.321
Check this shit out.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.656
Oh, hello!

40:49.656 --> 40:51.158
Oh-Ho-Ho-Ho!

40:51.158 --> 40:52.909
This is sweet!

40:52.909 --> 40:55.579
We jacked some eses. Got a BB gun, too.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.914
A BB gun? Yo.

40:57.998 --> 41:00.167
Goddamn!

41:00.167 --> 41:03.086
This is a nice little machine.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.130

his legs and arms blown off

49:06.236 --> 49:08.655
By a booby-Trapped motorcycle.

49:08.655 --> 49:11.908
Medic saved his ass and he lived.

49:11.992 --> 49:15.829
He didn't want to, but he did.

You look wasted.

49:43.940 --> 49:44.941
Don't trip, girl.

I've been working all day.

49:46.193 --> 49:50.530
I've been looking for work all day.

49:50.530 --> 49:53.533
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

49:53.533 --> 49:55.368
You know what?

49:55.368 --> 49:57.704
When I'm working, you can lounge.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.292

50:04.878 --> 50:06.296
Come here.

50:06.296 --> 50:09.716
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

50:09.716 --> 50:11.301
Hey, it's not about stuff.

50:11.301 --> 50:14.304
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

50:14.388 --> 50:15.806
Right.

50:15.806 --> 50:17.974
Hey, I know that you

50:17.974 --> 50:19.476
And I'm gonna always

50:19.476 --> 50:20.644
Owe you for that. Right.

50:21.978 --> 50:23.563
And I feel like I'm
doing everything alone.

50:23.563 --> 50:27.651
You know, sometimes I
feel like you're my kid.

50:27.651 --> 50:29.653
I mean, you sneak around like one.

50:29.736 --> 50:30.904
Oh-Ho!

50:30.904 --> 50:33.990
Look... Wow, dude.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.326

50:36.326 --> 50:37.327
Be cool, baby girl,

50:37.411 --> 50:38.829
I'm on a mission to
get my shit together.

50:38.829 --> 50:41.415
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

50:41.498 --> 50:43.750
And this black guy, he
was the office manager

50:43.750 --> 50:45.001
And he's fuckin' hella cool,

50:45.001 --> 50:46.837
You know? We're talkin'

50:46.837 --> 50:49.089
You know? We're just
kickin' it and all that.

50:49.172 --> 50:51.591
Did you, did you check the messages?

50:53.427 --> 50:55.929
Four messages.

50:56.012 --> 50:57.597
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

50:57.681 --> 51:00.267
From Sunhouse Properties

Honey, this is great!

51:02.853 --> 51:05.772
Mm, mm... Oh! Oh...

51:07.774 --> 51:09.359
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

51:09.359 --> 51:12.779
Oh, damn, dog, that shit was good, dude.

51:12.779 --> 51:15.282
Damn, they should give you a
fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

51:26.209 --> 51:27.961
You just stood there

51:27.961 --> 51:31.965
And you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

51:32.049 --> 51:35.802
You should be the lawyer.

51:35.886 --> 51:38.388
How could you just do that?

51:38.472 --> 51:42.142
How could you look me in the
eye and lie to me like that?

51:42.142 --> 51:43.226
I'm sorry.

51:43.226 --> 51:45.812
I'd rather you hit me.

51:47.314 --> 51:49.149
I'm your clown.

51:49.232 --> 51:50.734
I'm your fucking clown.

51:50.817 --> 51:54.321
And you and Jim are laughing at me?

51:54.321 --> 51:56.323
No, it's not...

51:56.406 --> 52:00.660
No, no, no, you are so
utterly, irrevocably busted!

52:04.331 --> 52:06.750
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

52:06.750 --> 52:08.752
Go cook up more lies.

52:08.752 --> 52:10.754
You know, I bet you're
doing lines again.

52:10.754 --> 52:13.423
Dude, how could you say that shit?

52:13.507 --> 52:14.674
I'm not fuckin' doing lines again.

52:14.758 --> 52:16.259
Yeah, right, right.

52:16.343 --> 52:17.928
I'm not fuckin' doing lines again!

52:18.011 --> 52:20.514
Right now your word is less than shit.

52:20.514 --> 52:22.599
Maybe you should go.

52:22.599 --> 52:26.520
Just fuckin' go.

52:26.520 --> 52:30.690
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

52:30.690 --> 52:32.275
Fuck it. I'll fuckin' go!

52:32.359 --> 52:33.443
Please, go. Go!

52:33.443 --> 52:35.362
Fuck it then! I'll fuckin' go!

52:35.445 --> 52:37.030
Then go, Mike!

52:37.114 --> 52:38.198
I'm serious! I'll fuckin' go

52:38.281 --> 52:39.449
Except I won't fuckin' come back!

52:39.533 --> 52:40.700
You want me to fuckin' go?!

52:40.700 --> 52:41.701
Fuckin' go, Mike!

52:41.785 --> 52:43.036
I'll fuckin' go then!

52:43.120 --> 52:44.037
I'll fuckin' go!

52:44.121 --> 52:47.040
Get the fuck outta here!

52:53.880 --> 52:56.383
Hello?

52:56.466 --> 53:00.137
Speaking.

53:00.137 --> 53:04.391
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

53:04.391 --> 53:07.477
Thank you very much, Agent Richards.

53:07.561 --> 53:09.563
Thank you, sir.

53:14.735 --> 53:15.736
Who was that?

53:15.819 --> 53:17.154
That was the feds, my friend.

53:17.237 --> 53:20.824
I've been informed that
I passed my urinalysis

53:20.907 --> 53:23.326
And they would like me
to go in this morning

53:23.326 --> 53:26.580
To start formal testing.

53:26.663 --> 53:28.081
Fuck yeah, dude.

53:28.165 --> 53:29.249
I'll be there all day,

53:29.249 --> 53:32.335
So take my ride, get your ass a job.

53:32.419 --> 53:33.420
Let's go.

53:33.420 --> 53:34.755
Oh, shit!

53:34.755 --> 53:38.425
Come on. Get your parasitic ass in gear.

53:42.512 --> 53:46.433
I had some twisted-Ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

53:46.516 --> 53:48.435
I slept like a baby.

53:48.518 --> 53:51.938
I heard screaming.

53:51.938 --> 53:53.523
What kind of tests?

53:53.523 --> 53:56.359
Psychological tests.

53:56.359 --> 53:59.613
Geez, you're a freakin' psycho, dude.

53:59.696 --> 54:01.114
Don't answer that shit honestly.

54:01.114 --> 54:03.617
Hell no.

54:03.617 --> 54:06.953
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

54:07.037 --> 54:11.124
It's like 600 questions,
cross-Referenced

54:11.208 --> 54:13.210
To detect deception.

54:13.210 --> 54:14.711
They ask the same shit

54:14.795 --> 54:16.713
Six different ways. It's lame.

54:16.797 --> 54:18.632
You'll ace it.

54:18.632 --> 54:22.219
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

54:22.219 --> 54:25.806
All I needed was a shot.

54:25.889 --> 54:27.641
Gotta play the system.

54:27.641 --> 54:30.977
Like a piano.

54:39.903 --> 54:41.488
You done with that crap, son?

54:41.571 --> 54:42.823
Yes, sir.

54:42.823 --> 54:45.492
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

54:45.492 --> 54:47.577
Bring that with you.

54:48.662 --> 54:50.580
I see dumb people.

54:53.750 --> 54:56.002
We reviewed your LAPD package.

54:56.002 --> 54:58.588
Since they ran your
background, physical and psych,

54:58.588 --> 55:00.674
We're going with their paper.

55:00.674 --> 55:02.259
Navy sucks. Army swallows.

55:02.342 --> 55:04.177
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

55:04.261 --> 55:05.679
From their people.

55:05.679 --> 55:08.265
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

55:08.348 --> 55:09.850
Move it, dirt bag.

55:11.351 --> 55:12.853
Why'd they drop me?

55:12.853 --> 55:15.355
Someone here make a call?

55:15.355 --> 55:16.773
Nope.

55:16.857 --> 55:18.108
They dropped you on psych, Jim.

55:19.526 --> 55:21.611
You blew their profiles.

55:21.695 --> 55:24.364
We're all a little goofy here.

55:24.364 --> 55:27.033
You'd rather be with us, wouldn't you?

55:27.117 --> 55:28.702
Absolutely, sir.

55:28.702 --> 55:31.037
Good answer.

55:31.037 --> 55:32.539
Have a seat.

55:33.790 --> 55:35.792
Said you were bilingual on your app.

55:35.876 --> 55:37.461
They want to test your Spanish.

55:37.544 --> 55:39.880
We can get that going if you got time.

55:39.963 --> 55:41.715
Yes. Sure.

55:41.798 --> 55:43.300
Who's "they"?

55:43.383 --> 55:44.885
Your fans upstairs.

55:44.968 --> 55:46.803
Fans upstairs? Who?

55:46.887 --> 55:49.389
This is some shit above my pay grade,

55:49.473 --> 55:52.976
But some very important
people have an eye on you, Jim.

55:57.314 --> 55:58.899
Westside Realty Management.

55:58.982 --> 56:00.650
How may I direct your call?

56:01.735 --> 56:02.903
Please hold.

56:02.986 --> 56:06.239
Okay, Mike...

56:06.239 --> 56:07.741
Alonzo?

56:07.741 --> 56:09.159
Oh, shit. Joe?!

56:09.242 --> 56:10.577
Damn...! What's up, dog?

56:10.660 --> 56:12.662
Mikey, look at you. What
are you doing here, dude?

56:12.746 --> 56:14.664
Mikey, man, check you out.

56:14.664 --> 56:15.916
What the fuck you doing here?

56:15.999 --> 56:17.334
Fucking grew up. I work here.

56:17.417 --> 56:18.919
Get out of here. Yeah.

56:19.002 --> 56:20.670
Dude, you got to come on up.

56:20.754 --> 56:21.922
Yeah, I'll show you the office.

56:22.005 --> 56:23.423
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

56:23.423 --> 56:24.841
I can see the ocean and everything.

56:24.841 --> 56:27.260
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.262
You're wearing a suit now.

56:29.262 --> 56:30.847
Got your hair cut. Hey, watch out, baby.

56:30.931 --> 56:32.015
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

56:32.099 --> 56:33.433
No, man.

56:33.517 --> 56:34.935
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

56:34.935 --> 56:37.020
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

56:37.104 --> 56:38.939
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

56:39.022 --> 56:41.191
Fuckin' Mexicans.

56:43.193 --> 56:44.111
Bye, sweetie.

56:47.697 --> 56:49.866
Thank you, sir. I need
me some of this, man.

56:49.950 --> 56:51.284
I've been taking piss all day.

56:51.284 --> 56:52.285
Dude!

56:52.285 --> 56:53.120
What?

56:53.203 --> 56:54.121
You're not going to

56:54.204 --> 56:55.288
Fucking believe this. What?

56:55.372 --> 56:57.457
I had an interview today. Yeah?

56:57.541 --> 56:58.959
Remember Crazy Joe? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:59.042 --> 57:00.877
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

57:00.961 --> 57:02.879
For grabbing his chick's ass.

57:02.963 --> 57:04.464
Homeboy got his shit together, man.

57:04.464 --> 57:05.549
Went to UCLA.

57:05.549 --> 57:07.801
Works at this office up in Century City.

57:07.801 --> 57:09.219
I got the hookup, dog.

57:09.219 --> 57:11.388
12 an hour. Hoo-Hoo!

57:11.388 --> 57:13.056
That's a lot of lettuce. That's right.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.725
And in three months, I get benefits.

57:14.808 --> 57:15.809
Damn! Benefits?

57:15.809 --> 57:17.561
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Shit!

57:17.561 --> 57:18.729
Yeah!

57:18.812 --> 57:20.397
It's not for sure yet, though, dude.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.065
I still got to meet the owner, right.

57:22.149 --> 57:23.817
But he says I'm straight.

57:23.817 --> 57:25.152
It's all good, you know.

57:25.235 --> 57:27.154
You're in. Dude...

57:27.154 --> 57:28.655
I'm in. Oh, shit.

57:28.655 --> 57:30.157
Yeah... What happened?

57:30.157 --> 57:31.742
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

57:31.825 --> 57:33.160
For a polygraph test.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.412
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

57:35.412 --> 57:37.497
Oh...! Damn! It's like that?!

57:37.497 --> 57:38.832
What's up, lawman?

57:38.832 --> 57:40.167
Whoo-Hoo!

57:40.167 --> 57:41.835
How you gonna pass a lie detector test,

57:41.835 --> 57:43.503
You lying motherfucker? Aw, easy, man.

57:43.503 --> 57:46.339
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

57:46.339 --> 57:48.008
Like you're taking a
dump, you know, man.

57:48.008 --> 57:50.093
It throws the machine off. Ooh! Oh, dog.

57:50.177 --> 57:51.845
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

57:51.928 --> 57:53.013
Fuck, I think I just did.

57:53.096 --> 57:54.681
All right, Jim,

57:54.765 --> 57:56.600
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

57:56.600 --> 57:58.852
Before we get to the good stuff.

57:58.935 --> 58:01.354
They can be answered just "yes" or "no."

58:01.438 --> 58:04.608
Just relax and respond naturally.

58:05.692 --> 58:06.777
Are you ready?

58:06.860 --> 58:07.778
Yes, sir.

58:07.861 --> 58:10.197
You can just answer "yes" or "no."

58:12.699 --> 58:15.619
"Is your name Jim Luther Davis?"

58:15.702 --> 58:17.370
Yes.

58:17.370 --> 58:19.956
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

58:20.040 --> 58:22.542
Yes.

58:22.542 --> 58:25.462
"Are you 26 years old?"

58:25.462 --> 58:26.546
Yes.

58:28.048 --> 58:29.716
"Are you married?"

58:29.800 --> 58:31.551
No.

58:35.389 --> 58:36.807
"Are you wearing shoes?"

58:36.890 --> 58:40.310
Yes.

58:40.310 --> 58:43.397
"Have you ever smoked marijuana?"

58:43.397 --> 58:47.734
Yes.

58:47.734 --> 58:50.737
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

58:50.737 --> 58:52.572
No.

58:55.909 --> 58:58.578
Jim, knock it off.

59:00.497 --> 59:01.748
What, sir?

59:01.832 --> 59:03.834
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

59:04.000 --> 59:07.087
Since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

59:07.170 --> 59:09.589
So I know all the tricks.

59:09.673 --> 59:11.258
You've either got a tack in your shoe

59:11.258 --> 59:13.260
Or you're clinching your butt.

59:13.260 --> 59:16.096
I've got spikes all over this thing.

59:16.096 --> 59:19.266
If you do it again,

59:19.349 --> 59:21.601
I'm going to void this test

59:21.601 --> 59:23.687
And report that you were uncooperative.

59:23.687 --> 59:25.021
Do you understand?

59:25.105 --> 59:26.857
Yes, sir.

59:29.776 --> 59:31.611
Walk with me.

59:33.697 --> 59:35.031
We've got a problem, Jim.

59:35.031 --> 59:36.450
With what?

59:36.450 --> 59:38.034
With your candor.

59:39.119 --> 59:41.204
Come in.

59:41.204 --> 59:42.289
He's here, sir.

59:42.372 --> 59:44.040
Bring him in.

59:45.959 --> 59:48.211
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

59:48.295 --> 59:49.212
Pleased to meet you, sir.

59:49.296 --> 59:50.797
Have a seat.

59:50.881 --> 59:52.382
Mr. Gillespie.

59:52.466 --> 59:54.801
Pleased to meet you, sir.

59:57.137 --> 59:59.473
Jim, uh...

59:59.473 --> 1:00:00.724
You're an exemplary candidate

1:00:00.807 --> 1:00:03.143
With valuable operational experience.

1:00:03.143 --> 1:00:06.813
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1:00:06.813 --> 1:00:09.566
Your credit's good, you've
kept your nose clean,

1:00:09.566 --> 1:00:11.068
You've got the Spanish.

1:00:11.068 --> 1:00:12.402
You clearance is still valid.

1:00:12.402 --> 1:00:13.820
Everybody we talked to for background

1:00:13.820 --> 1:00:16.740
Had only great things to say about you.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:18.825
And then you scored a
negative-Five on the polygraph.

1:00:18.909 --> 1:00:23.163
That's indicative of deception.

1:00:23.163 --> 1:00:24.748
We were wondering why

1:00:24.831 --> 1:00:27.584
Until we got the results of urinalysis.

1:00:27.584 --> 1:00:31.338
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1:00:33.173 --> 1:00:36.176
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1:00:36.259 --> 1:00:38.845
But there was a presence.

1:00:38.845 --> 1:00:40.931
Do you have a drug problem, Mr. Davis?

1:00:41.014 --> 1:00:42.516
I don't have a drug problem, sir.

1:00:44.351 --> 1:00:46.853
I made a very stupid mistake.

1:00:46.937 --> 1:00:48.271
Would you care to tell
us the circumstances

1:00:48.271 --> 1:00:49.439
Of your stupid mistake?

1:00:49.439 --> 1:00:51.441
I was at a party...

1:00:51.525 --> 1:00:54.611
And someone offered me a joint.

1:00:54.611 --> 1:00:58.365
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1:00:58.448 --> 1:01:02.369
The LAPD, so I was
feeling rebellious and, uh

1:01:05.372 --> 1:01:08.041
I inhaled.

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:10.711
Someone considering a
career in law enforcement

1:01:10.794 --> 1:01:12.295
Would be well advised to exercise

1:01:12.379 --> 1:01:13.964
A little more discipline.

1:01:13.964 --> 1:01:15.882
Yes, sir.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:20.220
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1:01:20.303 --> 1:01:21.805
It's your call.

1:01:21.805 --> 1:01:24.141
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1:01:24.141 --> 1:01:26.143
Yes, sir?

1:01:26.143 --> 1:01:29.062
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1:01:37.571 --> 1:01:39.322
Good.

1:01:39.322 --> 1:01:40.657
Recognize these guys?

1:01:44.244 --> 1:01:46.329
Huh? Yeah,

1:01:46.329 --> 1:01:47.330
They're your buddies.

1:01:47.414 --> 1:01:48.915
Your old Hajji buddies.

1:01:48.999 --> 1:01:51.001
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1:01:51.084 --> 1:01:52.085
Jesus Christ.

1:01:52.169 --> 1:01:53.587
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:01:53.670 --> 1:01:56.089
Did I ruin your lunch?

1:01:56.173 --> 1:01:57.924
You went through those sons of bitches

1:01:58.008 --> 1:02:00.010
Like butter.

1:02:00.093 --> 1:02:01.595
I took my objective

1:02:01.678 --> 1:02:03.180
And did what was necessary

1:02:03.180 --> 1:02:06.183
To obtain information
vital to national security

1:02:06.266 --> 1:02:08.351
That saved American lives.

1:02:08.435 --> 1:02:10.270
Whacked them all, huh, Jim?

1:02:10.270 --> 1:02:12.522
My C.O. Told me not to
leave anything breathing.

1:02:12.606 --> 1:02:14.441
I do what I'm told. Relax, son.

1:02:14.441 --> 1:02:18.278
You were getting paid to fuck people up.

1:02:18.278 --> 1:02:19.946
You know we're beefing up
our anti-Narcotics programs

1:02:19.946 --> 1:02:22.449
In Latin America.

1:02:22.532 --> 1:02:23.617
Yes, sir.

1:02:23.617 --> 1:02:26.453
I had heard some
things on the grapevine.

1:02:26.453 --> 1:02:28.121
I want you on my team.

1:02:28.121 --> 1:02:29.956
I need someone who can get things done

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:31.792
On my task force in Colombia.

1:02:31.792 --> 1:02:34.211
Sir...

1:02:34.211 --> 1:02:36.880
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1:02:36.963 --> 1:02:38.715
No slots in southern California?

1:02:38.715 --> 1:02:40.384
No, Jim.

1:02:40.384 --> 1:02:41.385
I got Colombia.

1:02:41.468 --> 1:02:43.303
That's what I have for you.

1:02:43.303 --> 1:02:45.305
If it's not what you want,

1:02:45.305 --> 1:02:46.306
Thank you for your time.

1:02:46.390 --> 1:02:48.725
You can hit the door.

1:02:50.310 --> 1:02:53.397
What exactly would I be doing?

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.982
Running and gunning in the jungle?

1:02:56.066 --> 1:02:58.151
Mr. Davis, this is the deal.

1:02:58.151 --> 1:03:00.153
You'll be riding shotgun with the locals

1:03:00.153 --> 1:03:02.406
As interpreter-Advisor
on sharp end operations.

1:03:02.489 --> 1:03:03.907
You'll be in some very hot areas.

1:03:03.907 --> 1:03:05.742
How hot?

1:03:05.742 --> 1:03:07.244
We talking trigger time?

1:03:07.244 --> 1:03:08.578
Sure, if you want.

1:03:08.578 --> 1:03:11.498
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1:03:11.498 --> 1:03:13.667
The U.S. Government, Jim.

1:03:13.750 --> 1:03:16.503
I want you in Glynco, Georgia next week.

1:03:16.503 --> 1:03:18.672
You make it through in one piece,

1:03:18.755 --> 1:03:22.259
You'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1:03:22.259 --> 1:03:24.177
It's just that...

1:03:24.177 --> 1:03:26.763
I'm supposed to get married, sir.

1:03:26.847 --> 1:03:28.849
Maybe now is not the
time to start a family.

1:03:28.849 --> 1:03:30.517
We've been together a long time.

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:32.936
I'm serious about marrying her.

1:03:33.019 --> 1:03:37.858
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1:03:37.941 --> 1:03:42.696
Jim, don't shack up with some Mexican.

1:03:42.696 --> 1:03:46.116
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1:03:46.116 --> 1:03:48.368
You get a per diem and a driver.

1:03:48.452 --> 1:03:50.537
You'll live like a
fucking king down there.

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:51.621
Yes, sir, I understand.

1:03:51.621 --> 1:03:52.706
You take some time,

1:03:52.706 --> 1:03:54.124
Think about what you want to do.

1:03:54.207 --> 1:03:55.208
This is a serious commitment.

1:03:59.379 --> 1:04:02.799
I want the opportunity, sir.

1:04:02.883 --> 1:04:04.801
I want on board.

1:04:09.723 --> 1:04:11.224
Welcome aboard.

1:04:11.224 --> 1:04:12.726
I'm taking a big chance on you.

1:04:12.809 --> 1:04:13.810
Thank you, sir.

1:04:13.894 --> 1:04:15.479
This is the career I've dreamed of.

1:04:15.562 --> 1:04:16.897
These are your orders,

1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:18.398
Orientation material and travel money.

1:04:18.482 --> 1:04:22.402
Report to FLETC before the
end of working hours Wednesday.

1:04:22.402 --> 1:04:24.571
Thank you, sir.

1:04:24.654 --> 1:04:25.739
God.

1:04:43.590 --> 1:04:45.926
Sorry, dog.

1:04:51.765 --> 1:04:53.850
I got the job.

1:04:55.018 --> 1:04:56.853
Oh, shit.

1:04:56.937 --> 1:04:59.439
Yeah?

1:04:59.523 --> 1:05:01.608
Me, too.

1:05:03.860 --> 1:05:06.196
When do you start? Monday.

1:05:06.279 --> 1:05:07.614
When do you start?

1:05:07.614 --> 1:05:08.865
Wednesday.

1:05:08.865 --> 1:05:12.285
Big Jim, back on the man's payroll.

1:05:12.369 --> 1:05:15.122
Got the W-2

1:05:15.122 --> 1:05:18.375
And the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1:05:18.458 --> 1:05:21.461
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1:05:21.545 --> 1:05:24.715
Good.

1:05:24.715 --> 1:05:27.134
Hey, we got to celebrate this shit.

1:05:28.135 --> 1:05:29.720
Salud.

1:05:33.390 --> 1:05:34.558
Oh, shit.

1:05:38.562 --> 1:05:40.313
Fuzz.

1:05:40.397 --> 1:05:42.232
They're on my ass, dog.

1:05:42.232 --> 1:05:45.068
And my license is suspended.

1:05:45.068 --> 1:05:46.903
Yeah, maybe he's after someone else.

1:05:48.989 --> 1:05:51.158
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1:05:51.241 --> 1:05:53.410
He's pointing right at me.

1:05:53.410 --> 1:05:55.495
And we got the open beers.

1:05:55.495 --> 1:05:58.415
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1:05:58.498 --> 1:06:00.333
Shoot the fucker.

1:06:00.333 --> 1:06:02.169
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1:06:05.172 --> 1:06:08.925
Shit. Right when shit was
starting to go good, dude,

1:06:09.009 --> 1:06:10.010
I'm going to jail.

1:06:10.093 --> 1:06:11.344
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1:06:13.597 --> 1:06:15.182
I can dump these guys.

1:06:16.349 --> 1:06:18.435
Rip the video from their trunk.

1:06:24.107 --> 1:06:25.275
Let's see them hands.

1:06:25.358 --> 1:06:26.359
Let's see your hands

1:06:26.359 --> 1:06:28.278
On the fucking dash!

1:06:28.278 --> 1:06:31.281
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1:06:31.364 --> 1:06:33.533
Blink and die, scumbags.

1:06:37.621 --> 1:06:39.289
Oh.

1:06:39.373 --> 1:06:41.208
Look who it is, dude.

1:06:41.291 --> 1:06:42.793
It's all right, I know these guys.

1:06:42.876 --> 1:06:44.878
You fucking asshole.

1:06:44.961 --> 1:06:46.880
You're such a prick. You
scared the fuck out of me.

1:06:46.963 --> 1:06:50.217
What's up, homie?

1:06:50.217 --> 1:06:52.886
What's up, fool? What's up, man.

1:06:52.969 --> 1:06:55.472
I almost shot you, jerk.

1:06:55.472 --> 1:06:56.973
That shit wasn't fucking funny, Leo.

1:06:57.057 --> 1:06:58.058
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1:06:58.058 --> 1:07:00.811
You guys getting fucked up?

1:07:00.811 --> 1:07:04.147
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1:07:04.147 --> 1:07:06.483
Well, Boot, you in the Academy yet?

1:07:06.483 --> 1:07:08.485
Fuck no.

1:07:08.568 --> 1:07:09.820
Fuck the LAPD.

1:07:09.903 --> 1:07:12.406
It's local small-Time bullshit.

1:07:12.406 --> 1:07:13.490
I'm going with the feds.

1:07:13.573 --> 1:07:14.658
How'd you get that hook-Up, dog?

1:07:14.658 --> 1:07:16.827
You know, me, got my connects, you know.

1:07:16.827 --> 1:07:17.911
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1:07:17.994 --> 1:07:19.663
Hey, see you can get me in there.

1:07:19.663 --> 1:07:21.331
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1:07:21.415 --> 1:07:23.166
How's Sylvia?

1:07:23.166 --> 1:07:25.335
None of your concern, ass wipe.

1:07:25.419 --> 1:07:27.754
Say hi to her for me, no?

1:07:27.754 --> 1:07:29.089
No.

1:07:29.172 --> 1:07:32.759
This vato's all
protective of his female.

1:07:32.759 --> 1:07:34.928
Check this out.

1:07:36.513 --> 1:07:37.514
Nice, huh?

1:07:37.597 --> 1:07:40.100
It's a nine? Uh-Huh.

1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:41.935
Sorry, dog, I got a lot of nines.

1:07:42.018 --> 1:07:43.520
Come on, dude, it's a bad-Ass Ruger.

1:07:43.603 --> 1:07:45.856
Talk to Toussaint. He'll buy that shit.

1:07:45.939 --> 1:07:47.858
Toussaint, he's... he's in Florida.

1:07:47.858 --> 1:07:50.360
He's back. He called me today.

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:54.781
Page me tonight, bro.

1:07:54.865 --> 1:07:58.785
We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.

1:07:58.785 --> 1:08:01.455
Later. Sure, dog.

1:08:01.538 --> 1:08:02.956
I'm on the City's time.

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:05.709
You guys be cool.

1:08:05.709 --> 1:08:07.711
Okay?

1:08:12.132 --> 1:08:13.800
That fuck-- He
put a scare in me.

1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:15.135
Yeah, me, too.

1:08:15.135 --> 1:08:16.303
He's a dick.

1:08:16.303 --> 1:08:18.055
Want to party with him?

1:08:22.642 --> 1:08:25.145
See if this motherfucker's home, dude.

1:08:31.902 --> 1:08:36.740
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1:08:36.823 --> 1:08:37.908
Yo, Toussaint?

1:08:37.908 --> 1:08:39.242
Yeah, come on, man.

1:08:39.326 --> 1:08:43.163
Can't go far in that little
fucking place of yours.

1:08:43.163 --> 1:08:45.248
Goddammit, I'm coming.

1:08:45.332 --> 1:08:47.167
Chill out.

1:08:48.668 --> 1:08:50.087
Washing that dirty ass.

1:08:54.174 --> 1:08:56.176
Damn it.

1:08:56.259 --> 1:08:58.845
Group love. Group... Come on.

1:08:58.929 --> 1:09:00.013
Group love, boys.

1:09:00.097 --> 1:09:03.850
Welcome back, hometown.

1:09:03.934 --> 1:09:07.354
Hey, I missed you crazy fuckers, man.

1:09:07.354 --> 1:09:08.855
Leo told us you were back.

1:09:08.939 --> 1:09:11.108
Thanks for calling asshole.

1:09:15.529 --> 1:09:19.032
You a cop?

1:09:19.032 --> 1:09:20.367
Uh-Uh. Going federal.

1:09:22.202 --> 1:09:24.538
Man, craziest head I know

1:09:24.621 --> 1:09:25.706
Is going

1:09:25.789 --> 1:09:26.707
To be a fed.

1:09:26.790 --> 1:09:30.043
Yes, sir! Sir.

1:09:30.043 --> 1:09:31.712
Still sponging off your woman?

1:09:31.795 --> 1:09:34.214
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1:09:34.214 --> 1:09:35.215
This motherfucker.

1:09:35.298 --> 1:09:37.718
Look, dude.

1:09:39.219 --> 1:09:41.221
This is bad.

1:09:41.304 --> 1:09:43.807
It's yours for three big ones, dog.

1:09:43.890 --> 1:09:47.811
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1:09:47.894 --> 1:09:51.481
What's up? What's up?

1:09:51.565 --> 1:09:53.233
Huh?

1:09:53.233 --> 1:09:55.652
What the fuck you say now, huh?

1:09:55.736 --> 1:09:57.237
Hey. Huh?

1:09:57.320 --> 1:09:59.906
Bam, bam, bam.

1:09:59.990 --> 1:10:02.909
Motherfucker, I'm strapped.

1:10:02.993 --> 1:10:05.328
What the fuck is up now, huh?

1:10:05.412 --> 1:10:07.164
Whoo-Ooh!

1:10:07.164 --> 1:10:08.331
Whoa, whoa.

1:10:08.415 --> 1:10:09.916
Your kneecap and shit.

1:10:09.916 --> 1:10:14.337
Step up and get blasted.

1:10:14.337 --> 1:10:18.341
Shit, man, what the fuck is up now?

1:10:18.341 --> 1:10:20.260
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:21.261
It's loaded.

1:10:21.261 --> 1:10:22.596
That shit goes through walls.

1:10:22.596 --> 1:10:23.764
You pop the neighbor's little kids.

1:10:25.098 --> 1:10:26.266
Uh-Oh.

1:10:26.266 --> 1:10:27.601
Ooh.

1:10:28.518 --> 1:10:31.438
Fuck, dude.

1:10:31.438 --> 1:10:34.524
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1:10:34.524 --> 1:10:38.779
Yo, guys, we got to
party tonight, you know?

1:10:38.779 --> 1:10:40.614
Go clubbin' or something.

1:10:40.614 --> 1:10:41.948
I got a better idea.

1:10:41.948 --> 1:10:42.949
What?

1:10:42.949 --> 1:10:43.950
Here, sir.

1:10:45.952 --> 1:10:47.954
Let's go to Mexico.

1:10:48.038 --> 1:10:49.623
Mexico?!

1:10:49.623 --> 1:10:51.708
Yeah. I'm in.

1:10:55.629 --> 1:10:57.464
Only fags like that...

1:10:57.464 --> 1:10:59.466
Because you're a little faggot.

1:10:59.466 --> 1:11:00.967
I don't get it, too much fucking hills.

1:11:00.967 --> 1:11:02.052
Right, right.

1:11:02.135 --> 1:11:05.472
Dude, yo, dude, stay
back boy, stay back.

1:11:05.472 --> 1:11:07.808
Motherfucker's got to ask permission.

1:11:07.891 --> 1:11:10.727
Fuck you, all right?

1:11:10.811 --> 1:11:12.562
Let me tell you something.

1:11:12.562 --> 1:11:14.564
I am a grown motherfucking
man, all right?

1:11:14.648 --> 1:11:16.316
I'm going to tell her the good news,

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:18.652
Make up, grab my shit and we are out.

1:11:18.735 --> 1:11:21.154
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1:11:21.154 --> 1:11:23.490
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1:11:23.573 --> 1:11:25.659
The waiting has become unbearable.

1:11:25.659 --> 1:11:27.160
It's hit or miss, you
can't predict it...

1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:30.163
Excuse me, you're not made out of glass.

1:11:30.163 --> 1:11:31.164
I'm made out of me.

1:11:31.164 --> 1:11:33.834
You're drunk.

1:11:33.834 --> 1:11:35.335
I'm celebrating, baby.

1:11:35.419 --> 1:11:36.753
What, another wasted day?

1:11:38.630 --> 1:11:40.257
Here.

1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:42.676
...security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1:11:42.676 --> 1:11:45.846
...and still a recent
study shows the wait at LAX

1:11:45.887 --> 1:11:47.431
Is the third longest in the world...

1:11:51.184 --> 1:11:52.602
This is a good company.

1:11:52.644 --> 1:11:54.813
They make all the new condos downtown.

1:11:54.855 --> 1:11:55.814
How much?

1:11:55.856 --> 1:11:56.898
$12 an hour.

1:11:56.940 --> 1:11:57.899
Plus their MIS guy

1:11:57.941 --> 1:11:59.109
Is leaving in three months.

1:11:59.192 --> 1:12:00.944
I'm going to update my certifications

1:12:00.986 --> 1:12:02.195
And take his job over.

1:12:02.195 --> 1:12:03.363
Then I'll make bank.

1:12:06.867 --> 1:12:08.618
Such an asshole.

1:12:08.702 --> 1:12:10.620
What? Why? This shit is real.

1:12:10.620 --> 1:12:12.622
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1:12:12.622 --> 1:12:15.542
And it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1:12:15.584 --> 1:12:17.294
I know.

1:12:17.377 --> 1:12:20.464
It's so... it's so Mike, you know.

1:12:20.547 --> 1:12:22.716
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1:12:22.799 --> 1:12:24.217
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1:12:24.217 --> 1:12:25.218
A dream job?

1:12:25.218 --> 1:12:26.553
Yeah, a dream job.

1:12:26.595 --> 1:12:29.556
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1:12:29.556 --> 1:12:31.558
...the ambitious plans of many opponents

1:12:31.641 --> 1:12:34.561
On the County Board of Supervisors...

1:12:42.069 --> 1:12:44.404
Come here, I have a job for you.

1:12:55.916 --> 1:12:58.001
What the fuck is taking so long?

1:12:58.085 --> 1:12:59.586
I knew this shit would happen.

1:12:59.586 --> 1:13:00.921
She hates my ass.

1:13:00.962 --> 1:13:03.256
She's not going to let him go.

1:13:03.256 --> 1:13:05.092
Go knock.

1:13:06.718 --> 1:13:09.304
Dude, go knock.

1:13:09.346 --> 1:13:13.767
Bro, drag his fucking ass out of there.

1:13:20.941 --> 1:13:22.442
Yo, Miguel.

1:13:24.945 --> 1:13:27.447
Hey.

1:13:27.447 --> 1:13:30.367
Mike, hurry up.

1:13:32.119 --> 1:13:33.453
Hey.

1:13:33.453 --> 1:13:35.288
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1:13:35.372 --> 1:13:36.707
Come on, dude.

1:13:36.707 --> 1:13:38.792
Dog, I'm tearin' it up, man.

1:13:38.875 --> 1:13:41.169
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1:13:41.211 --> 1:13:43.880
You guys just go ahead,
man. I'm gonna chill.

1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:45.298
What?

1:13:45.298 --> 1:13:47.801
I'm just gonna kick
it here with the woman.

1:13:47.801 --> 1:13:50.470
You said you'd go, man.

1:13:50.512 --> 1:13:52.097
Your woman's in your head.

1:13:52.097 --> 1:13:53.140
That's wrong.

1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:54.474
She's got your nuts, bro.

1:13:54.474 --> 1:13:56.393
Dog, dog...

1:13:56.476 --> 1:13:59.396
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1:13:59.438 --> 1:14:01.314
She wants us to fuckin' chill together.

1:14:01.314 --> 1:14:04.901
Man, that girl put the zap on your head.

1:14:04.985 --> 1:14:06.570
This is our last chance to hang.

1:14:06.570 --> 1:14:09.906
You're like my brother. Yeah.

1:14:09.990 --> 1:14:11.575
You're all I got. You're
gonna dog me like that?

1:14:11.658 --> 1:14:12.951
I ain't no fucking do...

1:14:12.993 --> 1:14:15.162
How are you, baby?

1:14:15.162 --> 1:14:17.330
Hey, Sylvia, he's going to Mexico.

1:14:17.414 --> 1:14:20.709
No, he isn't, Jim. Yes, he is.

1:14:20.751 --> 1:14:24.755
I'm joining the feds. I'm
gone, I'm out of here next week.

1:14:24.755 --> 1:14:26.339
The least you can do

1:14:26.339 --> 1:14:27.758
Is let my best friend

1:14:27.758 --> 1:14:29.092
See me off.

1:14:29.092 --> 1:14:30.260
Baby, it's not safe.

1:14:30.260 --> 1:14:31.720
All you're going to do is drink.

1:14:31.762 --> 1:14:33.764
Aw, fuck, man.

1:14:33.805 --> 1:14:35.515
Mike, come on.

1:14:35.515 --> 1:14:37.392
Come on, fuck, man!

1:14:37.434 --> 1:14:39.186
Come on, you promised.

1:14:39.269 --> 1:14:40.771
You promised, man.

1:14:40.854 --> 1:14:45.942
Yo... I promised, Sylvia, okay?

1:14:46.026 --> 1:14:47.861
Mike, you're not going to Mexico.

1:14:47.903 --> 1:14:49.613
What?

1:14:49.696 --> 1:14:51.198
You're not going.

1:14:51.198 --> 1:14:54.367
I'm not your fucking puppet, Sylvia.

1:14:54.367 --> 1:14:56.745
All right, you know
what, do what you want.

1:14:56.787 --> 1:14:59.039
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1:14:59.122 --> 1:15:00.290
That's fucked up.

1:15:00.332 --> 1:15:02.292
Why you got to lay that bullshit on him?

1:15:02.376 --> 1:15:04.211
Because I don't want
him going with you, Jim.

1:15:04.294 --> 1:15:06.296
You're fucking nuts.

1:15:06.296 --> 1:15:08.548
You're crazy and you're dangerous,

1:15:08.632 --> 1:15:10.550
And my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1:15:10.550 --> 1:15:12.052
You're the last person
who should have one.

1:15:12.052 --> 1:15:13.053
Yeah? Yeah.

1:15:13.053 --> 1:15:14.221
That's not bullshit, it's the truth.

1:15:14.221 --> 1:15:15.514
Fuck this!

1:15:15.555 --> 1:15:16.640
Whoa, wait.

1:15:16.723 --> 1:15:18.141
Whatever, man.

1:15:18.225 --> 1:15:20.727
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

1:15:20.727 --> 1:15:21.812
Yeah, laters.

1:15:21.895 --> 1:15:24.231
Bye.

1:15:24.314 --> 1:15:25.649
Yo, yo.

1:15:25.649 --> 1:15:26.983
I'm going.

1:15:28.402 --> 1:15:29.403
I gotta go.

1:15:29.403 --> 1:15:31.071
Get the fuck out of here, go!

1:15:32.406 --> 1:15:33.156
Go!

1:15:33.198 --> 1:15:34.908
Fuck this shit, man.

1:15:34.991 --> 1:15:36.243
Good night, Sylvia.

1:15:36.326 --> 1:15:37.411
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1:15:37.411 --> 1:15:39.454
Oh, any time, sellout.

1:15:39.496 --> 1:15:42.124
Oh, you going to be
happy once he's dead? Huh?

1:15:51.091 --> 1:15:52.426
Hey, Toussaint.

1:15:52.426 --> 1:15:54.094
I heard the battle, man.

1:15:54.136 --> 1:15:56.430
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1:15:56.430 --> 1:15:57.931
No, but I'm going.

1:15:57.931 --> 1:15:59.433
Hell, yeah. Shit.

1:15:59.516 --> 1:16:01.017
I'm a motherfucking man. That's right.

1:16:01.101 --> 1:16:03.103
Shit. I walk the Earth at will.

1:16:03.186 --> 1:16:05.063
Damn right. I do
whatever the fuck I want.

1:16:05.105 --> 1:16:06.106
You know, we're men, right?

1:16:06.189 --> 1:16:07.357
We're men, right? That's right.

1:16:07.441 --> 1:16:08.692
That's what we do, right?

1:16:08.692 --> 1:16:10.360
Amen. And
don't worry--

1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:12.612
Home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1:16:12.612 --> 1:16:13.780
You're right. You're right.

1:16:13.780 --> 1:16:14.990
She wouldn't play that shit like that.

1:16:15.031 --> 1:16:16.450
Shit, I got a fucking job for real.

1:16:16.450 --> 1:16:17.367
You did.

1:16:17.367 --> 1:16:18.869
Plus you're my homie,
dog. You're my homie.

1:16:19.036 --> 1:16:20.537
You're going to go fucking do your thing

1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:22.372
And this is it. No, shit, dude.

1:16:22.456 --> 1:16:23.457
Yo, we're all dogs.

1:16:23.457 --> 1:16:24.791
I got you guys back, man.

1:16:24.833 --> 1:16:25.876
No doubt, no doubt.

1:16:26.043 --> 1:16:27.627
It's just going to be fucking cool, yo.

1:16:27.711 --> 1:16:29.379
I got a job, you got a job.

1:16:29.463 --> 1:16:30.881
Shit, I got some bud.

1:16:31.048 --> 1:16:32.299
We got some smokes. We got some

1:16:32.299 --> 1:16:34.051
Motherfucking money.
We are on a mission.

1:16:34.051 --> 1:16:37.054
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1:16:37.054 --> 1:16:38.221
In a timely manner.

1:16:38.221 --> 1:16:40.807
Let's get deployed, people.

1:17:06.041 --> 1:17:08.126
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1:17:08.126 --> 1:17:09.252
Rise and fucking shine.

1:17:09.336 --> 1:17:11.797
Come on, ladies. Chow time.

1:17:11.838 --> 1:17:13.006
Chow's getting cold.

1:17:13.090 --> 1:17:16.093
Oh, what the fuck, Jim? Chill, dude.

1:17:31.608 --> 1:17:33.193
Dude, where are we?

1:17:33.276 --> 1:17:36.238
Family, man.

1:17:36.279 --> 1:17:37.823
Damn! It's a shizzack...

1:17:37.864 --> 1:17:38.865
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:17:38.865 --> 1:17:41.368
It's a home, all right?

1:17:41.368 --> 1:17:43.578
Respect, bro.

1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:45.455
Straighten up, fellas.

1:17:48.875 --> 1:17:50.794
My old lady, Marta.

1:17:50.836 --> 1:17:51.795
Hola.

1:17:51.795 --> 1:17:52.963
Mike. Hola, mucho gusto.

1:17:53.004 --> 1:17:54.506
Hola, Mike. Toussaint.

1:17:54.506 --> 1:17:55.966
Hola. Hola. Hola.

1:17:56.049 --> 1:17:57.634
Hola. Marisa.

1:17:57.634 --> 1:17:58.719
Buenos dias. Mi mama.

1:17:58.802 --> 1:17:59.720
Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.

1:17:59.761 --> 1:18:01.722
Buenos dias.

1:18:01.763 --> 1:18:03.056
Vicki. Vicki.

1:18:03.056 --> 1:18:04.975
La prima, esa es mi prima.

1:18:05.058 --> 1:18:06.143
Mucho gusto.

1:18:06.226 --> 1:18:07.394
Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.

1:18:07.394 --> 1:18:09.104
Toussaint.

1:18:09.146 --> 1:18:10.313
Vicki.

1:18:10.397 --> 1:18:11.815
Okay.

1:18:11.898 --> 1:18:13.400
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.152
Sí, por favor, sientense.

1:18:17.487 --> 1:18:18.488
Vicki?

1:18:18.488 --> 1:18:20.157
¿Café, quieren café?

1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.159
Sí, café, por favor. Vicki, andale.

1:18:22.159 --> 1:18:24.411
Tranquila, baby.

1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:28.582
¡Mama!

1:18:28.665 --> 1:18:30.751
Yeah, w-What's she saying, dude?

1:18:30.834 --> 1:18:32.836
Oh, they... they think you're cool.

1:18:32.919 --> 1:18:34.004
Oh, sweet.

1:18:36.339 --> 1:18:38.175
Aquí tienes. Gracias.

1:18:38.175 --> 1:18:40.510
Caliente. Thank you.

1:18:44.347 --> 1:18:45.557
Dude...

1:18:45.599 --> 1:18:47.017
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

1:18:47.100 --> 1:18:48.226
Hey, hey, hey...

1:18:48.268 --> 1:18:50.312
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1:18:50.353 --> 1:18:52.689
If you don't, you're a fool.

1:18:52.773 --> 1:18:54.858
¿Que dice?

1:18:54.858 --> 1:18:57.861
Oh...

1:18:57.861 --> 1:18:59.946
Oh, that shit's good, man.

1:19:00.030 --> 1:19:02.532
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1:19:02.532 --> 1:19:05.452
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1:19:05.535 --> 1:19:07.871
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1:19:07.996 --> 1:19:10.457
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1:19:10.457 --> 1:19:11.625
You know, and then maybe

1:19:11.666 --> 1:19:13.752
They'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1:19:13.752 --> 1:19:15.879
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1:19:26.556 --> 1:19:27.724
Shit.

1:19:33.146 --> 1:19:34.147
Toussaint?

1:19:38.985 --> 1:19:40.987
This is nice.

1:19:41.071 --> 1:19:43.323
This is beautiful, man.

1:19:43.407 --> 1:19:44.491
Dog, you see this?

1:19:44.533 --> 1:19:46.827
Here.

1:19:48.203 --> 1:19:49.204
Mmm...

1:19:49.246 --> 1:19:50.414
Beautiful...

1:19:50.414 --> 1:19:51.665
Man!

1:19:51.748 --> 1:19:53.166
Mmm!

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:55.252
When the hell'd you
get all the pistos, dog?

1:19:55.335 --> 1:19:56.545
Mexico, man.

1:19:56.586 --> 1:19:57.587
It's magic.

1:20:01.842 --> 1:20:02.926
He bleed?

1:20:03.009 --> 1:20:03.927
Like a stuffed pig.

1:20:05.095 --> 1:20:06.930
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1:20:06.972 --> 1:20:09.516
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

1:20:09.558 --> 1:20:11.184
Ah... I took her to dinner.

1:20:11.268 --> 1:20:13.520
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1:20:13.603 --> 1:20:16.273
Got up all in it. Back of my ride...

1:20:16.314 --> 1:20:17.941
Pounded that fish, man.

1:20:18.024 --> 1:20:19.359
Good fuckin' fish.

1:20:19.401 --> 1:20:20.485
I figured the crazy broad

1:20:20.527 --> 1:20:21.862
Pulled out some hairs and pubes

1:20:21.862 --> 1:20:23.613
And stashed it in the seat, you know?

1:20:23.613 --> 1:20:26.241
Oh, dude, you got to
watch that shit, man.

1:20:26.241 --> 1:20:28.535
Chicks get treacherous.

1:20:28.618 --> 1:20:31.204
Yeah, no shit. Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1:20:31.204 --> 1:20:32.622
Next day,

1:20:32.622 --> 1:20:35.083
I'm driving around with
Letty all kick back and shit,

1:20:35.083 --> 1:20:38.462
And she radars in on
this rat's nest, man.

1:20:38.545 --> 1:20:41.298
Pulls out these long-Ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1:20:41.339 --> 1:20:42.299
"Whose are these?"

1:20:43.884 --> 1:20:46.887
She sees all the pubes mixed
in, man... fuckin' busted.

1:20:47.054 --> 1:20:48.889
Busted! Busted!

1:20:49.056 --> 1:20:50.223
Oh!

1:20:50.223 --> 1:20:52.559
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1:20:52.642 --> 1:20:54.061
Oh, come on, dude.

1:20:54.144 --> 1:20:55.645
Mexican chick voodoo, right, Mike?

1:20:55.729 --> 1:20:57.230
You know, live and learn.

1:20:57.230 --> 1:20:59.733
Yep, next time you'll
be all up in your ride

1:20:59.733 --> 1:21:01.568
With the Super Vac, dude. Treachery!

1:21:01.651 --> 1:21:03.653
Yep, treachery.

1:21:09.659 --> 1:21:11.745
Um...

1:21:11.745 --> 1:21:13.497
Shouldn't we be

1:21:13.497 --> 1:21:14.706
Helping them?

1:21:14.748 --> 1:21:16.249
You know how to hand wash?

1:21:16.291 --> 1:21:17.834
No. Then don't sweat it.

1:21:17.876 --> 1:21:18.919
Yeah, we're men.

1:21:19.086 --> 1:21:20.504
They know we don't do that shit.

1:21:20.587 --> 1:21:21.505
That's right.

1:21:21.546 --> 1:21:22.923
We're men.

1:21:24.758 --> 1:21:26.093
Oh, yeah!

1:21:29.304 --> 1:21:30.514
This is paradise, huh?

1:21:30.597 --> 1:21:31.932
Mm-Hmm.

1:21:33.767 --> 1:21:35.352
Yo, Mike?

1:21:35.435 --> 1:21:36.853
Yeah?

1:21:36.937 --> 1:21:38.146
They're sending me to Colombia.

1:21:43.777 --> 1:21:46.530
Colombia.

1:21:46.571 --> 1:21:48.198
Who, the man?

1:21:48.281 --> 1:21:50.158
Yep.

1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.369
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1:21:52.452 --> 1:21:54.287
Doing what?

1:21:54.287 --> 1:21:56.206
Busting up drug labs and drug lords

1:21:56.206 --> 1:21:57.874
And all that shit. You got it.

1:21:57.958 --> 1:22:00.377
Gonna be an advisor, you
know-- Shoot him, him and him.

1:22:00.460 --> 1:22:02.546
Then it's back to the
barracks for bitches and beer.

1:22:02.629 --> 1:22:04.464
I'm set.

1:22:04.464 --> 1:22:06.633
Why do you want to do that shit, dude?

1:22:06.633 --> 1:22:08.218
I mean...

1:22:08.301 --> 1:22:11.596
What about Marta, you know?

1:22:11.638 --> 1:22:12.639
I mean...

1:22:12.723 --> 1:22:14.641
Ain't gonna happen.

1:22:14.683 --> 1:22:17.144
They told me not to get married.

1:22:17.144 --> 1:22:19.062
That's messed.

1:22:19.146 --> 1:22:20.147
They really told you that?

1:22:20.230 --> 1:22:21.940
Not straight up, but I heard 'em.

1:22:21.982 --> 1:22:24.818
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1:22:24.818 --> 1:22:26.486
You need to tell them to fuck off.

1:22:26.570 --> 1:22:27.988
Yeah, I mean,

1:22:27.988 --> 1:22:30.657
You love her, she loves you, right?

1:22:30.741 --> 1:22:33.326
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1:22:33.410 --> 1:22:34.828
You know, get a good-Ass job

1:22:34.911 --> 1:22:37.497
Working with fucking
tourists or something.

1:22:37.497 --> 1:22:38.915
Fuck that.

1:22:38.915 --> 1:22:41.209
Taking bucket baths in cold-Ass water?

1:22:41.251 --> 1:22:43.086
You know, wading around
in ankle-Deep mud?

1:22:43.086 --> 1:22:44.087
Outhouses, man!

1:22:44.171 --> 1:22:46.089
Fuckin' outhouses!

1:22:46.173 --> 1:22:48.175
You told Marta yet?

1:22:52.095 --> 1:22:53.722
You love this place.

1:22:53.764 --> 1:22:57.017
It's in your eyes, man.

1:22:57.100 --> 1:22:59.519
Dude, this is what it's all about.

1:22:59.519 --> 1:23:03.774
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1:23:03.857 --> 1:23:05.442
You'd be happy here, and you know it.

1:23:05.525 --> 1:23:09.780
Yeah, well, shacking up with Marta,

1:23:09.863 --> 1:23:14.951
Squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1:23:15.035 --> 1:23:18.288
This is my career.

1:23:18.330 --> 1:23:20.332
I got one shot.

1:23:20.374 --> 1:23:21.917
You're making a mistake.

1:23:22.042 --> 1:23:26.713
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1:23:26.797 --> 1:23:28.173
What the fuck you gonna do

1:23:28.173 --> 1:23:30.050
In Colombia?

1:23:32.302 --> 1:23:34.221
Whack people,

1:23:34.221 --> 1:23:35.472
Program shit.

1:23:35.514 --> 1:23:38.141
You ain't down, fuck you.

1:23:38.225 --> 1:23:40.060
Bring in my gunships

1:23:40.143 --> 1:23:43.146
And smoke your little
jungle hideaway. You know?

1:23:43.230 --> 1:23:44.856
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1:23:44.856 --> 1:23:46.066
I'll be in a chopper,

1:23:46.149 --> 1:23:49.820
Door-Gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1:23:49.903 --> 1:23:52.697
Kill the chickens and dogs, too, man.

1:23:54.074 --> 1:23:56.576
I don't give a fuck.

1:24:08.505 --> 1:24:09.589
Shh, shh...

1:24:30.235 --> 1:24:31.361
Yeah.

1:26:01.702 --> 1:26:02.786
Doce años.

1:26:02.869 --> 1:26:04.454
Doce años. Doce años...

1:26:04.454 --> 1:26:06.665
Doce... we've been together that long.

1:26:06.707 --> 1:26:07.958
Es muy bonita.

1:26:08.041 --> 1:26:09.334
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1:26:09.376 --> 1:26:11.628
Cover that shit up. Jim, dude!

1:26:11.628 --> 1:26:12.796
Huh?

1:26:12.879 --> 1:26:15.298
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1:26:15.298 --> 1:26:16.883
Huh? "Bonita." Bonita.

1:26:19.302 --> 1:26:21.555
Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

1:26:21.555 --> 1:26:23.348
Tu... bonita.

1:26:23.390 --> 1:26:24.474
Gracias.

1:26:24.558 --> 1:26:26.017
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1:26:26.059 --> 1:26:27.394
Right, did I get it? Huh?

1:26:27.394 --> 1:26:28.645
Think I got it?

1:26:28.729 --> 1:26:31.815
Yeah, she got the point.

1:26:34.985 --> 1:26:38.405
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1:26:38.447 --> 1:26:40.240
What chick?

1:26:41.825 --> 1:26:43.827
Oh, she's good, dog.

1:26:43.910 --> 1:26:46.079
Yeah, name's Lila.

1:26:46.079 --> 1:26:48.165
She's a freak. She'll fuck you, dude.

1:26:49.666 --> 1:26:51.418
She's a freak, huh?

1:26:51.460 --> 1:26:53.086
How you know? You fuck her?

1:26:53.128 --> 1:26:55.172
No, out of respect for Marta.

1:26:55.213 --> 1:26:58.341
Not that I don't want... Hey, baby.

1:26:58.425 --> 1:27:01.887
Ask her to dance.

1:27:01.970 --> 1:27:04.056
I'm not cheating on Sylvia, dude.

1:27:05.849 --> 1:27:09.102
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1:27:09.102 --> 1:27:11.021
Go explore it.

1:27:12.189 --> 1:27:13.857
No shit.

1:30:02.859 --> 1:30:04.403
No.

1:30:15.956 --> 1:30:17.541
You're fucking nuts.

1:31:24.357 --> 1:31:26.526
You fucked up, woman.

1:31:28.195 --> 1:31:30.197
I'll do it.

1:31:35.369 --> 1:31:36.870
It's easy.

1:31:53.970 --> 1:31:57.307
Jim!

1:32:22.082 --> 1:32:24.084
What's up, man, huh?

1:32:24.084 --> 1:32:25.585
Where's Toussaint?

1:32:25.669 --> 1:32:27.087
He's dancing.

1:32:27.087 --> 1:32:28.088
Yeah? Yeah.

1:32:28.088 --> 1:32:29.089
You gonna get back

1:32:29.089 --> 1:32:30.257
To the party? Yeah.

1:32:30.257 --> 1:32:32.509
Let's get back to the party, man.

1:32:34.010 --> 1:32:35.846
Yeah. Hey, uh, go,

1:32:35.929 --> 1:32:37.514
Go tell Toussaint that

1:32:37.597 --> 1:32:39.099
We're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

1:32:39.182 --> 1:32:40.767
Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

1:32:40.851 --> 1:32:41.768
We're leaving, huh?

1:32:41.852 --> 1:32:43.270
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna leave.

1:32:43.353 --> 1:32:44.938
Let's go, yeah?

1:32:45.021 --> 1:32:46.106
Yeah, let's go.

1:32:46.189 --> 1:32:47.524
Go ahead, go get Toussaint, man.

1:32:47.607 --> 1:32:48.608
Go get him.

1:32:56.366 --> 1:32:58.201
Hey, we're going.

1:32:58.201 --> 1:32:59.202
Come on.

1:32:59.202 --> 1:33:00.203
Fuck you, dude.

1:33:00.203 --> 1:33:02.205
I'm having a great time, bro.

1:33:02.289 --> 1:33:04.291
Then walk back to L.A., motherfucker.

1:33:04.374 --> 1:33:05.792
You're in the car or not.

1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:11.798
He's fucking crazy, man.
What the fuck!

1:33:11.798 --> 1:33:14.801
All right, let's go, man.

1:33:16.553 --> 1:33:19.056
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is your problem, psycho?!

1:33:19.056 --> 1:33:20.807
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

1:33:20.807 --> 1:33:23.810
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

1:33:23.894 --> 1:33:24.895
Fucking bullshit!

1:33:27.397 --> 1:33:28.732
Fucked up!

1:33:57.761 --> 1:34:01.181
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1:34:04.601 --> 1:34:06.103
Fuck, man.

1:34:06.186 --> 1:34:09.773
Whoo, yeah, man.

1:34:09.773 --> 1:34:11.441
Slow down, you crazy motherfucker!

1:34:11.441 --> 1:34:14.194
I want a cop to pull me over.

1:34:15.779 --> 1:34:18.031
Treachery.

1:34:18.031 --> 1:34:19.950
Fucking treachery.

1:34:19.950 --> 1:34:22.285
Jim, slow down!

1:34:22.285 --> 1:34:23.453
Shut up!

1:34:24.621 --> 1:34:26.039
Fuck, dude.

1:34:26.790 --> 1:34:29.042
Only female I trust.

1:34:31.128 --> 1:34:32.963
Fuck you, God!

1:34:33.046 --> 1:34:36.550
You ain't got the fucking
balls to take my ass.

1:34:38.135 --> 1:34:41.638
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1:34:56.737 --> 1:34:57.904
Jim!

1:35:00.907 --> 1:35:04.494
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1:35:04.578 --> 1:35:07.080
You need psychiatric help, man.

1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:10.417
You're seriously fucked up, dude.

1:35:10.417 --> 1:35:15.922
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1:35:15.922 --> 1:35:17.674
You used to be mellow.

1:35:21.011 --> 1:35:22.262
Later, homie.

1:35:22.345 --> 1:35:24.097
'Night, dog.

1:35:24.097 --> 1:35:26.349
Laters.

1:35:26.349 --> 1:35:28.351
Dude, I ain't hanging around you anymore

1:35:28.351 --> 1:35:29.686
Until you get some fucking help.

1:35:29.686 --> 1:35:32.439
You can 12-Step off, bitch.

1:35:32.439 --> 1:35:34.775
You're dismissed.

1:35:47.537 --> 1:35:49.289
He's right, dude.

1:35:49.373 --> 1:35:50.374
Yeah.

1:35:53.293 --> 1:35:55.796
Georgia will get me squared away.

1:35:55.879 --> 1:35:58.715
Hope so.

1:35:58.715 --> 1:36:02.219
What was that shit with Marta, dude?

1:36:02.219 --> 1:36:06.973
I don't know why that happened.

1:36:09.142 --> 1:36:11.228
But I'm cool. I'm cool now.

1:36:11.311 --> 1:36:13.146
Okay?

1:36:15.065 --> 1:36:16.066
Yeah.

1:36:16.066 --> 1:36:17.734
I'm cool.

1:36:28.829 --> 1:36:31.164
Look, dude, she told
me she was pregnant.

1:36:31.164 --> 1:36:32.916
I had a panic attack.

1:36:32.999 --> 1:36:34.084
I pulled my gun.

1:36:34.084 --> 1:36:35.335
Come on, dog,

1:36:35.335 --> 1:36:37.087
I thought you loved her, dude.

1:36:37.170 --> 1:36:39.673
I do.

1:36:39.673 --> 1:36:41.758
God, fuck.

1:36:41.758 --> 1:36:44.511
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

1:36:47.931 --> 1:36:49.182
What bud?

1:36:49.266 --> 1:36:52.102
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

1:36:52.102 --> 1:36:53.437
Say that again?

1:36:53.437 --> 1:36:55.605
There's 20 kilos in the trunk, man.

1:36:57.190 --> 1:36:58.525
Of weed? Yeah.

1:36:58.525 --> 1:36:59.860
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:01.361
I picked it up at the party.

1:37:01.361 --> 1:37:03.697
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:05.365
Casper's?

1:37:05.449 --> 1:37:07.200
I get three Gs.

1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:10.287
We get three Gs.

1:37:10.287 --> 1:37:11.872
You drove it across the border?

1:37:11.955 --> 1:37:14.041
Yeah.

1:37:14.041 --> 1:37:15.375
What if they would've caught us?

1:37:15.375 --> 1:37:17.210
Couldn't happen, man.

1:37:17.210 --> 1:37:20.797
My shit is on fire right now, man.

1:37:20.881 --> 1:37:23.467
My shit is wired right now, man.

1:37:23.550 --> 1:37:25.635
You risked my ass without telling me?

1:37:25.719 --> 1:37:28.472
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

1:37:28.555 --> 1:37:31.224
That's... that's a good
rate for transporting that.

1:37:31.224 --> 1:37:33.226
Shit, if I'd told you,

1:37:33.226 --> 1:37:34.394
You would have gotten

1:37:34.478 --> 1:37:37.064
All fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

1:37:37.147 --> 1:37:39.066
I wouldn't have been in
the fucking car, dude!

1:37:39.149 --> 1:37:41.485
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

1:37:41.568 --> 1:37:43.487
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

1:37:43.570 --> 1:37:45.155
Not fuckin' telling me.

1:37:45.155 --> 1:37:47.824
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, you know.

1:37:47.991 --> 1:37:50.160
I should've had... I
should've got you guys,

1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:51.745
You know, walk across the border.

1:37:51.745 --> 1:37:53.246
I could've met you somewhere.

1:37:53.246 --> 1:37:55.415
But, you know, I got bills, I got shit.

1:37:55.499 --> 1:37:56.750
I gotta put my shit in storage.

1:37:56.833 --> 1:37:59.086
I gotta get gas out to Georgia.

1:37:59.169 --> 1:38:01.088
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

1:38:01.088 --> 1:38:03.173
I am not catching a

Everything's gonna be fine.

1:45:39.046 --> 1:45:40.297
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:45:40.297 --> 1:45:42.549
Take a look at me, you dumb fuck!

1:45:42.632 --> 1:45:45.052
Everything's gonna be fine?!

1:45:45.052 --> 1:45:46.887
Come on...

And you put it to my fuckin' head...

1:45:51.975 --> 1:45:55.062
And you pull the trigger.

1:45:55.062 --> 1:45:56.813
You fuckin' step up...

1:45:56.897 --> 1:45:58.565

And you do it.

1:45:59.566 --> 1:46:00.650

1:46:00.734 --> 1:46:02.569
'Cause I can't.

1:46:08.241 --> 1:46:10.327
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

1:46:10.327 --> 1:46:11.661
Oh, my God...

1:46:11.661 --> 1:46:13.163
Don't think about it.

1:46:13.163 --> 1:46:14.915
Huh?

1:46:14.915 --> 1:46:15.916
Do it.

1:46:15.916 --> 1:46:18.168
Please.

1:46:18.251 --> 1:46:19.252
Just kill you and bail?

Or you'll...

1:46:27.427 --> 1:46:31.014
Or you'll turn into a pillar of salt.

1:46:31.098 --> 1:46:33.350
Hey... Hey...

1:46:33.433 --> 1:46:36.353
You wanted to know what it
was like to kill someone.

1:46:36.353 --> 1:46:40.107
What's up, huh?

1:46:40.190 --> 1:46:41.358
No one's gonna know.

1:46:41.441 --> 1:46:43.944
Hmm?

You're crazy; I'm not shootin' you, dog.

1:46:54.705 --> 1:46:55.872
It's mercy, dog.
