An address

01:08.608 --> 01:10.656
Anybody have any weird stuff

01:11.936 --> 01:13.472
Sometimes at night I see a

01:13.728 --> 01:16.544
Shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's Tower

01:16.800 --> 01:18.592
I have a feeling it might be

01:18.848 --> 01:20.384
Are the Royals winning

01:20.640 --> 01:22.944
G7 chord stuff

01:23.200 --> 01:27.552
We have this closed

01:36.256 --> 01:37.024
Excuse me

01:37.280 --> 01:40.864
I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own

01:41.120 --> 01:43.680
I developed this high-tech device

01:43.936 --> 01:44.960
Broadcast

01:45.216 --> 01:45.728
Waves that

01:45.984 --> 01:48.544
Theoretically disrupt parallel dimensions

01:55.456 --> 01:56.224
So

01:56.480 --> 01:58.016
Tanqueray

01:58.272 --> 02:01.600

02:08.512 --> 02:12.864
What I thought

02:15.680 --> 02:19.264
There is something very wrong thing in the Candy Kingdom

02:19.520 --> 02:24.128
A dark entity I plan to purge from the face of

02:24.896 --> 02:27.968
Which presidents have been elected every home

02:28.224 --> 02:31.040
Can replace a business even here
