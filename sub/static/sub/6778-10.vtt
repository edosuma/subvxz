01:42.630 --> 01:45.758
( radio chatter)

01:45.870 --> 01:47.132
WHY IS IT ALWAYS
UP TO ME, CINDY ?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.662
I END UP
DOING EVERYTHING.

01:48.770 --> 01:51.807
I'LL BRING THE FOOD, BUT I THINK
ANN SHOULD BRING THE DRINKS.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.537
WHAT'S THEIR
ADDRESS AGAIN ?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.438
I MEAN, SHE BROUGHT
ONE LOUSY PIZZA

01:56.550 --> 01:57.699
FOR THE WHOLE TEAM
TO THE LAST GAME.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.038
I NEED
THE EXACT ADDRESS.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.811
I KNOW HOW TO
GET THERE.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.773
I WANT TO
USE THE G.P.S.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.915
YOU'RE DEAD !

02:03.020 --> 02:03.884
WHAT GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING ?

02:03.990 --> 02:04.809
MORTAL KOM BAT.

02:04.920 --> 02:05.716
IS THAT VIOLENT ?

02:05.820 --> 02:06.582
IT'S NOT VIOLENT.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.112
I NEED A NEW DVD !

02:08.220 --> 02:09.323
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT GAME ?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.385
HONEY, JUST USE
THAT ONE AGAIN.

02:10.490 --> 02:11.320
I NEED
THE EXACT ADDRESS.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.795
HE SAYS,
IT'S BOBBY'S.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.925
CINDY SAYS NO WAY BOBBY'S
ALLOWED TO PLAY THAT GAME.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.122
SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHERE HE GOT IT.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.390
WE JUST
PASSED CRESCENT.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.569
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO TURN LEFI' ON CRESCENT.

02:18.670 --> 02:19.989
WHICH WAY,
I NEED THE ADDRESS.

02:20.100 --> 02:20.839
I'M WAITING.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.599
JUST A SECOND, HONEY.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.098
JUST GIVE HER ONE.

02:22.210 --> 02:22.904
WHICH ONE ?

02:23.010 --> 02:23.533
GO LEFI' !

02:23.640 --> 02:24.436
HERE ?

02:24.540 --> 02:25.859
( honking )

02:38.220 --> 02:40.688
THERE'S SOMETHING
WEIRD ABOUT TWINS.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.224
ABOUT TH ESE
TWINS, ANYWAY.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.898
THEY'RE CUTE.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.798
THEY SMELL
LIKE BANANAS.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.358
YOU JUST DON'T THINK
ANY KID'S AS GOOD AS MAYA.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.300
WELL,
THEY'RE NOT.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.876
'CAUSE YOU'RE PERFECT,
AREN'T YOU ?

03:03.010 --> 03:04.898
WE COULD HAVE
A PRETI'Y GREAT KID.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.783
WHAT TIME ARE
THEY COMING DOWN ?

03:11.890 --> 03:13.016
TOMORROW
AFTERNOON SOMETIME.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.553
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO COOK FOR THEM ?

03:14.660 --> 03:17.254
'CAUSE I REALLY
DON'T FEEL LIKE

03:17.360 --> 03:19.123
MAKING DINNER FOR
SOMEONE WHO HATES ME.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.596
BARB DOESN'T
HATE YOU.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.361
SHE WAS JUST
SURPRISED TO SEE YOU.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.598
OKAY, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
HER FAVORITE PERSON,

03:26.700 --> 03:28.531
BUT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR
HER TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.902
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO HIDE ME IN THE GARAGE ?

03:30.010 --> 03:31.932
I CAN CURL UP
REAL SMALL--

03:32.040 --> 03:33.735
BREN.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.471
SO, ABOUT THAT
THING I JUST SAID ?

03:37.580 --> 03:39.673
THAT THING THAT YOU
COMPLETELY IGNORED ?

03:39.780 --> 03:43.511
I HEARD YOU.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.611
WE COULD HAVE
A GREAT KID.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.187
SO...?

03:47.290 --> 03:48.609
SO, IT'S SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.381
TO THINK ABOUT.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.549
YEAH, I ALREADY HAD A KID
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT

03:52.660 --> 03:55.299
AND I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT AGAIN.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.618
SO, WHEN WERE YOU THINKING
ABOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ?

03:57.730 --> 03:59.561
BECAUSE I'M THINKING
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.967
WHAT'S THE RUS?

04:01.070 --> 04:04.335
WELL, UM,

04:04.440 --> 04:08.274
I'M KIND OF AN AGE WHERE
I CAN'T COMMIT TO A RELATIONSHIP

04:08.380 --> 04:12.419
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE
POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A CHILD.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.817
SO LOOK, IF
YOU'RE SAYING "NO"--

04:14.920 --> 04:15.818
I'M NOT SAYING "NO".

04:15.920 --> 04:16.944
I JUST...

04:19.990 --> 04:22.652
IT'S OVERWHELMING JUST
DEALING WITH ONE CHILD,

04:24.830 --> 04:26.354
ALL THIS,
KIND OF NEW.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.189
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES
A COUPLE OUR AGE

04:28.300 --> 04:31.292
AN AVERAGE OF A YEAR
TO GET PREGNANT,

04:31.400 --> 04:32.799
SO, EVEN IF WE
STARTED TRYING NOW

04:32.900 --> 04:35.437
WE MIGHT NOT HAVE
A BABY FOR TWO YEARS.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.534
I'M NOT SAYING "NO".

04:38.640 --> 04:39.470
I PROMISE.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.299
OKAY.

04:45.510 --> 04:46.772
YOU GOT GROCERIES ?

04:46.880 --> 04:50.816
CHANDLER WALNUTS FROM
THE FARMER'S MARKET.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.480
ALL OF THAT
IS WALNUTS ?

04:53.590 --> 04:55.581
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH THEM ?

04:55.690 --> 04:57.248
WE'RE GOING
TO EAT THEM.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.022
SOME OF THEM WE CAN
PROCESS INTO WALNUT BU'I'I'ER,

05:00.130 --> 05:02.462
BUT MOSTLY
WE'LL EAT THEM.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.026
THEY'RE FULL OF PROTEIN
AND OMEGA THREES.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.461
OH.

05:05.570 --> 05:08.266
I GOT THE BROCHURE FROM
THE LOVING COUPLES CENTER.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.736
WHAT'S THAT ?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.569
THE RETREAT THAT
KYLE AND BECKY WENT ON !

05:12.680 --> 05:14.898
THERE'S QUITE A LIST OF WEEKEND
WORKSHOPS THAT THEY OFFER.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.444
THEY SENT
A VIDEOTAPE AS WELL.

05:17.550 --> 05:21.771
"INTIMACY AND HEALING."

05:21.880 --> 05:24.519
"FINDING THE NEW
IN YOUR PARTNER."

05:24.620 --> 05:27.680
AND "TANTRIC LOVE,"

05:27.790 --> 05:29.621
WHICH YOU SEEM
TO HAVE CIRCLED.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.051
HOPING TO ADD SOME
SPICE TO OUR SEX LIFE ?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.991
IT'S BECOMING
VERY POPULAR.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.389
WOODY HARRELSON, JILL EIKENBERRY
AND STING ARE ALL PRACTITIONERS.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.991
I MEAN, NOT WITH EACH
OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW...

05:41.100 --> 05:43.330
RUTH, IF THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO DO,

05:43.440 --> 05:45.135
I'D BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO GO.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.400
REALLY ?

05:46.510 --> 05:47.704
I'M SO PLEASED.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.949
I'LL FILL OUT
THE APPLICATION.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.542
OH, I WAS WONDERING.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.141
WHERE DO YOU KEEP
YOUR EXTRA WATER ?

05:56.250 --> 05:57.979
THERE'S A PITCHER
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.650
NO, I MEAN FOR EARTHQUAKES
AND OTHER EMERGENCIES.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.921
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE
SOME EXTRA WATER ON HAND,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.021
FLASHLIGHTS, BATTERIES,
SOME CANNED FOOD.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.598
DO YOU
KNOW SOMETHING ?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.349
IS THERE GOING
TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE ?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.028
IS THAT WHY YOU
GOT THE WALNUTS ?

06:11.130 --> 06:13.633
NO, I GOT THE WALNUTS
BECAUSE I LIKE WALNUTS.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.800
AND YES, THERE MOST CERTAINLY
IS GOING TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.537
WE CAN'T PINPOINT
EXACTLY WHEN.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.733
BUT COULD
BE TOMORROW.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.034
COULD BE
100 YEARS FROM NOW.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.471
OH, YOU HAD
ME CONCERNED.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.445
WELL, YOU SHOULD
BE CONCERNED.

06:25.550 --> 06:26.972
WE SHOULD ALL BE
CONCERNED AND PREPARED.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.742
IF NOT FOR AN EARTHQUAKE
THEN A TERRORIST ATTACK,

06:29.850 --> 06:33.411
OR A CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT,
OR WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.853
GEORGE,
LATELY IT SEEMS

06:36.960 --> 06:38.359
IF IT'S NOT ONE THING
WITH YOU, IT'S ANOTHER.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.020
EXACTLY.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.159
WOW.

06:50.270 --> 06:53.671
WOW, THESE
ARE AMAZING.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.509
REALLY...

06:55.610 --> 06:57.999
AMAZING, CLAIRE.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.748
YEAH,
THEY'RE SO COOL.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.977
THEY REMIND ME
OF THAT GUY,

07:02.080 --> 07:03.342
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

07:03.450 --> 07:05.213
THE GUY WHO DOES PEOPLE
IN SWIMMING POOLS.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.514
DAVID HOCKN EY.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.054
YEAH, AND HE DID THIS
ONE THING OF PHOTOGRAPHS

07:09.160 --> 07:11.048
LIKE OF
THE DESERT--

07:11.160 --> 07:12.081
PEAR BLOSSOM HIGHWAY.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.452
YEAH, THAT.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.394
BUT IT'S LIKE YOU TOOK
IT 10 STEPS FURTHER.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.127
YOU MADE
IT PERSONAL.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.539
YOU KNOW, JEAN BAUDRILLARD ONCE
SAID EVERY POSSIBLE ART FORM

07:21.640 --> 07:25.963
HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLORED
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS

07:26.070 --> 07:28.607
TO DECONSTRUCT
AND PLAY WITH THE PIECES.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.371
THAT'S LITERALLY
WHAT YOU DID.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.619
EXPLAIN THE PROCESS.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.212
WELL, I'D TAKE A WHOLE
BUNCH OF CLOSE-UPS OF SOMEONE,

07:36.320 --> 07:38.709
LIKE EVERY INCH
OF THEIR FACE,

07:38.820 --> 07:42.620
AND THEN PRINT
THOSE ACTUAL SIZE,

07:42.730 --> 07:45.654
AND PHOTOCOPY THEM,
AND THEN PAPIER-MACHE PIECES

07:45.760 --> 07:49.992
OVER THE PERSON'S FACE
AND MAKE AN ACTUAL MASK.

07:50.100 --> 07:54.764
THEN WHEN THAT DRIED I HAD
THEM PUT THE MASK BACK ON

07:54.870 --> 07:59.807
AND THEN I WOULD TAKE
A PORTRAIT IN A SETTING

07:59.910 --> 08:02.640
THAT HOPEFULLY REVEALS
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE PERSON.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.947
YEAH, THERE'S SO
MUCH DEPTH TO THEM.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.245
EXACTLY, THEY'RE
LIKE SCULPTURE.

08:08.350 --> 08:10.409
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE THINKING ?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.488
I DON'T KNOW...

08:12.590 --> 08:14.057
I GUESS I WAS THINKING
MORE EMOTIONALLY,

08:14.160 --> 08:19.518
LIKE HOW MANY LAYERS
THERE ARE TO A PERSON,

08:19.630 --> 08:21.325
AND HOW WE
ALL WEAR MASKS,

08:21.430 --> 08:24.797
EVEN IF THAT MASK
IS OUR OWN SKIN.

08:24.900 --> 08:29.064
BUT I THINK IT WAS
MY BACKGROUND IN SCULPTURE

08:29.170 --> 08:32.936
THAT REALLY ALLOWED
US TO MAKE THAT LEAP.

08:33.040 --> 08:37.477
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
PUT THE PICTURES

08:37.580 --> 08:41.277
OF CLAIRE'S OPEN EYES
OVER HER CLOSED EYES,

08:41.380 --> 08:43.689
I WAS THINKING
OF HER AS SCULPTURE.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.042
SO, YOU HELPED
HER WITH THESE ?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.015
IN TERMS OF CREATING
THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,

08:48.120 --> 08:50.384
YEAH, WE
WORKED TOGETHER.

08:50.490 --> 08:53.459
I MEAN, SHE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER,
I'M A SCULPTOR,

08:53.560 --> 08:56.393
AND SOMEHOW WE COMBINED
THOSE TWO ELEMENTS

08:56.500 --> 08:59.060
AND CREATED
SOMETHING NEW.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.601
I THINK THEY
TURNED OUT GREAT.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.529
YOU LOOK JUST
LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.143
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
EVERYONE SAYS.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.616
OR SAID.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.540
I'M SO SORRY.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.448
SUCH A TRAGEDY.

09:18.550 --> 09:21.587
I STILL CAN'T
EVEN QUITE...

09:24.330 --> 09:25.786
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.467
DOES YOUR FAMILY
HAVE A BURIAL PLOT ?

09:30.570 --> 09:34.961
I DON'T KNOW,
I DOUBT IT.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.402
CREMATION IS
A POPULAR OPTION.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.398
YEAH, DO THAT.

09:39.510 --> 09:41.603
BUT THEN BURIED.

09:41.710 --> 09:42.904
I WANT THEM SOMEWHERE
ALL TOGETHER,

09:43.010 --> 09:44.272
WHERE I CAN
GO SEE THEM.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.699
WE CAN
ARRANGE THAT.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.641
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
KIND OF SERVICE YOU WANT ?

09:47.750 --> 09:50.583
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
KIND OF SERVICES THERE ARE.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.352
JUST A REGULAR ONE.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.609
OKAY.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.087
DID YOUR FAMILY HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS ?

09:58.190 --> 10:02.798
THEY HAD FRIENDS, BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHO ALL OF THEM ARE.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.562
OKAY, WELL, WE CAN POST
A NOTICE IN THE PAPER.

10:05.670 --> 10:06.739
WE'RE ALSO HAPPY
TO MAKE ANY CALLS.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.195
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER FAMILY ?

10:09.300 --> 10:13.805
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE DEALING WITH THIS ALONE.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.878
ONE GRANDMOTHER LEFT,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.847
BUT SHE'S
IN A HOME.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.872
AND AN AUNT
AND AN UNCLE IN FLORIDA,

10:20.980 --> 10:22.413
BUT I DON'T
REALLY KNOW THEM.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.044
SO, IT'S JUST ME.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.624
MY WHOLE FAMILY...

10:35.230 --> 10:37.596
BASICALLY, WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
AT HERE IS BATTERY, ASSAULT

10:37.700 --> 10:40.032
AND INTENTIONAL INFLICT ION
OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.962
MR. PASQUESE SUFFERED A TORN
EARLOBE, INFLICTING ACUTE PAIN

10:44.070 --> 10:46.675
AND REQUIRING METICULOUS
SURGICAL RESCULPTURING.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.736
THE PAIN'S RENDERED
HIM UNABLE TO WORK

10:48.840 --> 10:50.307
AND HE'S HAD
TO DROP OUT AS PRODUCER

10:50.410 --> 10:51.547
OF A MAJOR MOTION
PICTURE.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.810
WHAT ?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.808
ADDITIONALLY, HIS
IRREPLACEABLE EARRING

10:54.920 --> 10:55.944
WAS LOST DURING
THE COURSE OF THE ATTACK.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.517
IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE HOOP !

10:57.620 --> 10:59.679
WHO WEARS EARRINGS
NOW ANYWAY ?

10:59.790 --> 11:02.782
MR. PASQUESE HAS ALSO
SUFFERED RECURRENT NIGHTMARES

11:02.890 --> 11:04.824
AND HAS BEEN UNABLE TO ENTER
A SUSHI ESTABLISHMENT,

11:04.930 --> 11:06.898
GREATLY LESSENING
HIS ENJOYMENT OF LIFE.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.628
FOR THESE REASONS WE
ARE ASKING FOR RESTITUTION

11:09.730 --> 11:10.924
OF $500,000.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.691
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR
FUCKING MIND ?!

11:12.800 --> 11:14.859
WE'LL LEAVE YOU
TO CONSIDER THE DETAILS.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.939
IF THEY'RE NOT TO YOUR LIKING
WE'LL INSTITUTE A CIVIL CASE,

11:18.040 --> 11:20.304
AND CONSIDER PRESSING
CRIMINAL CHARGES.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.742
OH, MY GOD.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.218
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.457
SHE CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE SERIOUS, CAN SHE ?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.913
HOW STRONG
IS HIS CASE ?

11:35.020 --> 11:38.285
DID YOU BITE HIS EAR,
MR. FISHER ?

11:38.390 --> 11:39.527
WELL, YES.

11:39.630 --> 11:41.120
WELL, THEN HIS
CASE IS QUITE GOOD.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.619
BUT WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO ?

11:43.730 --> 11:45.163
I DON'T HAVE THAT
KIND OF MONEY.

11:45.270 --> 11:48.933
CAN'T WE DO A TEMPORARY
INSANITY PLEA OR WHATEVER ?

11:49.040 --> 11:51.634
I MEAN, HIS THERAPIST
THINKS HE'S SUFFERING

11:51.740 --> 11:53.435
FROM POST TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.235
WELL, IN THE EVENT

11:55.340 --> 11:57.001
THAT THIS CASE GOES TO TRIAL,
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.476
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT
THIS TO GO TO TRIAL ?

11:59.580 --> 12:03.038
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THINGS
BECOME VERY EXPENSIVE.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.779
I LIKE THIS
RESTAURANT.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.755
HOW'D YOU
HEAR ABOUT IT ?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.081
JOE.

12:11.190 --> 12:14.318
OH, HAVE YOU BEEN
SPEAKING TO HIM LATELY ?

12:14.430 --> 12:18.093
NO, HE HASN'T CALLED AND
I FEEL TOO GUILTY TO CALL HIM.

12:18.200 --> 12:23.661
I THINK HE FEELS
LIKE I BETRAYED HIM.

12:23.770 --> 12:26.034
AND I NEVER
TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY.

12:26.140 --> 12:29.177
WELL, YOU
CERTAINLY DID...

12:29.280 --> 12:31.077
BETRAY HIM.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.774
WELL, YEAH, MOM,
I KNOW THAT, THANK YOU.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.017
COME ON, DARLING.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.610
I'M NOT
JUDGING YOU.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.211
I'VE DONE
FAR WORSE.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.083
THE THING IS, IS THAT
I DID TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.124
I REALLY BELIEVED
THAT I WAS GOING

12:43.230 --> 12:45.448
TO SETTLE DOWN
AND HAVE HIS BABY.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.949
I NEVER THOUGHT

12:48.060 --> 12:49.288
THAT I COULD HAVE
THAT WITH NATE.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.766
THAT HE WOULD
FORGIVE ME

12:51.870 --> 12:55.636
AND WANT
TO TAKE ME BACK.

12:55.740 --> 13:01.804
WELL, I THINK NATE'S
BEEN GOING THROUGH

13:01.910 --> 13:03.502
SOME LIFE-CHANGING
EXPERIENCES HIMSELF.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.749
OH, HE'S STILL
GOING THROUGH THEM.

13:05.850 --> 13:08.045
BUT I THINK
I UNDERSTAND

13:08.150 --> 13:09.242
HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH LISA BETTER NOW.

13:09.350 --> 13:13.787
HOW YOU CAN SETTLE
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S

13:13.890 --> 13:16.859
JUST NOT THE PERSON
YOU SHOULD BE WITH.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.828
YOU KNOW, YOU AND NATE
SOUND LIKE ME AND BERN.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.989
WE KNEW EACH OTHER,

13:24.100 --> 13:28.230
I MEAN,
WE UNDERSTOOD EACH--

13:33.440 --> 13:35.374
WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER
LIKE NOBODY ELSE COULD.

13:35.480 --> 13:40.543
GOD HELP YOU.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.847
( laughing )

13:45.020 --> 13:47.056
THE CHICKEN
CAESAR SALAD, PLEASE.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.127
MOM ?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.152
AND I'M GONNA HAVE THE
PORTERHOUSE STEAK, MEDIUM RARE.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.797
YOU'RE HAVING
STEAK FOR LUNCH ?

13:54.900 --> 13:59.496
YEAH, I'M JUST FEELING
A LITTLE ANEMIC LATELY.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.058
YEAH, YOU DO
LOOK A LITTLE PALE.

14:03.170 --> 14:06.435
NO, I THINK I'LL
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.076
RIGHT BACK.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.269
( door bell )

14:14.920 --> 14:16.444
HI, MY NAME'S
ALBERT GROSS.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.211
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
MIGHT HAVE A MOMENT

14:18.320 --> 14:19.878
TO DISCUSS YOUR
ETERNAL HAPPINESS.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.352
YEAH, SURE.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.189
COME ON IN.

14:27.730 --> 14:29.220
THROUGH A GLOBAL
PREACHING CAMPAIGN,

14:29.330 --> 14:31.161
GOD IS MAKING KNOWN
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT HIS KINGDOM

14:31.270 --> 14:32.897
GOVERN ED BY
JESUS CHRIST.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.264
THOSE WHO RESPOND ARE
GATHERING INTO A PLACE

14:35.370 --> 14:37.133
OF SPIRITUAL
PROTECTION AND HEALING.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.037
SOON WE'LL
EXPERIENCE FREEDOM

14:39.140 --> 14:40.505
FROM ALL INJUSTICE
AND SUFFERING.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.908
SEEMS TO ME LIKE JUST
THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING.

14:43.010 --> 14:45.149
THAT'S BECAUSE
HUMAN GOVERNMENT

14:45.250 --> 14:46.569
IS STILL UNDER
THE CONTROL OF SATAN.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.649
THE PERFECT GOVERNMENT
IS IN HEAVEN.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.310
FROM THERE, THE KING JESUS
CHRIST WILL RULE ALL THE EARTH.

14:52.420 --> 14:56.311
SO, HOW DO YOU THINK
KING JESUS PLANS TO ADDRESS

14:56.420 --> 14:59.127
THE EVER-WIDENING HOLES
IN THE OZONE LAYER,

14:59.230 --> 15:02.324
OR THE MISSING STOCKPILES
OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM ?

15:02.430 --> 15:06.719
WELL, I THINK THAT
GOD WILL SOLVE ALL

15:06.830 --> 15:08.161
OF MANKIND'S PROBLEMS
IN HIS OWN WAY.

15:08.270 --> 15:11.103
ALBERT.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.199
LOOK.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.177
THIS IS AN ENORMOUSLY
COMPLEX WORLD WE LIVE IN

15:15.280 --> 15:18.272
AND ITS PROBLEMS
ARE MULTIPLYING EVERY DAY.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.110
NOW, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS

15:21.220 --> 15:23.415
BY GOING DOOR TO DOOR
AND ASKING PEOPLE

15:23.520 --> 15:25.078
TO GET DOWN ON THEIR
KNEES AND PRAY TO THE SKY.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.988
SHOULDN'T A BRIGHT
YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU

15:28.090 --> 15:29.557
BE DOING SOMETHING
CONSTRUCT IVE ?

15:29.660 --> 15:33.596
I'M GOING TO WRITE DOWN
A COUPLE OF WEBSITES FOR YOU

15:33.700 --> 15:37.591
TO CHECK OUT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY
ENLIGHTEN YOU A LITTLE BIT.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.529
EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU
BRENDA CHENOWITH ?

15:46.640 --> 15:47.834
YES.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.601
YOUR MOM NEEDS YOU
IN THE LADIES' ROOM.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.644
OH, THANK YOU.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.844
MOM ?

15:54.950 --> 15:56.770
I'M IN HERE.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.211
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PADS ?

15:58.320 --> 16:01.756
NO, WHY DO
YOU NEED A PAD ?

16:01.860 --> 16:04.420
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAD
THAT VAGINA SURGERY.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.920
NO, I JUST WENT IN
FOR A CONSULTATION.

16:08.030 --> 16:12.228
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
BLEEDING A LOT LATELY.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.169
OH GOD, MOM.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.706
IT WON'T STOP.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.209
IT JUST WON'T STOP.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.574
I'M CALLING 9-1-1,
DON'T WORRY, MOM.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.648
DON'T WORRY.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.275
( door opens )

16:29.180 --> 16:31.717
CLAIRE,
IT'S ME MOM.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.780
I HAVE
YOUR LAUNDRY.

16:36.890 --> 16:38.585
OH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.750
BUT IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE
TO COME UP AND VISIT.

16:41.860 --> 16:45.591
WELL, YOU CAN COME UP
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.066
THANK YOU.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.728
THERE'S NO ONE
IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.276
IT'S SO QUIET.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.329
I KNOW THAT SMELL.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.212
IS THIS MARIJUANA ?

17:07.690 --> 17:10.420
UH, YEAH.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.088
OH.

17:12.190 --> 17:16.024
I USED TO SMELL IT ON NATHANIEL
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.764
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS SOME
SORT OF EMBALMING CHEMICAL.

17:20.870 --> 17:23.430
HE NEVER GAVE IT
TO YOU, DID HE ?

17:23.540 --> 17:24.461
NO.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.128
OH, GOD, NO.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.208
I DISCOVERED
IT ON MY OWN.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.505
HOW FUNNY THAT NATHANIEL
WOULD KEEP IT A SECRET.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.772
DO YOU SMOKE
IT A LOT ?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.438
NOT TOO MUCH.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.744
THAT'S GOOD.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.182
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU
SHOULD TREAT IT AS A SPICE.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.417
JUST A LITTLE PINCH
HERE AND THERE.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.488
OKAY.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.922
HOW STRIKING.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.396
YOU USED TO MAKE
COLLAGES AS A LITTLE GIRL.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.497
IDID?

17:50.600 --> 17:51.999
YOU WERE ALWAYS
TEARING UP MY MAGAZINES

17:52.100 --> 17:53.237
BEFORE I COULD
READ THEM.

17:53.340 --> 17:57.333
OH WOW...
I MEAN, SORRY.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.771
WELL, BACK TO MY
QUIET HOUSE, I SUPPOSE.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.201
WELL, YOU GOT
GEORGE IN THERE.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.815
HE'S NOT MUCH
OF A NOISE-MAKER.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.879
HEY, ARE
THINGS OKAY ?

18:12.990 --> 18:14.412
OH YES,
DEFINITELY BETTER.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.784
I CAN SEE HE'S
TRYING AND SO AM I.

18:16.890 --> 18:19.950
HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE JUST
NEEDS TO LET ME IN A LITTLE.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.948
I STILL WANT
TO GROW OLD WITH HIM.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.597
I MEAN, I'M ALMOST
THERE ALREADY.

18:24.700 --> 18:28.431
OH, PLEASE, YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.838
HE AGREED TO GO TO A LOVING
COUPLES WORKSHOP WITH ME.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.931
REALLY ?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.200
THAT'S COOL.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.732
ON TANTRIC LOVE.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.479
MOM.

18:38.580 --> 18:39.649
I KNOW !

18:39.750 --> 18:45.017
DON'T TELL
THE BOYS.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.783
( giggling )

18:48.890 --> 18:51.381
( door bell )

18:58.370 --> 18:59.997
HEY, GUYS,
HOW WAS THE MOVIE ?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.159
AUGUSTO WAS SCARED.

19:02.270 --> 19:05.762
YOU TOOK THEM
TO SEE A SCARY MOVIE ?

19:05.870 --> 19:07.576
NO, IT WAS
A CARTOON.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.829
THEY'RE TOO YOUNG
TO SEE SCARY MOVIES.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.305
IT WASN'T SCARY.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.174
YOU GUYS GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
GET READY FOR BED.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.580
SO, JULIO TELLS ME
THAT WHAT'S HER NAME,

19:17.690 --> 19:22.252
KENNY'S SISTER, JULIE,
HAS BEEN WATCHING THEM.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.123
ISN'T SHE SOME
KIND OF DRUGGIE ?

19:24.230 --> 19:25.959
OH, PLEASE, SHE SMOKED
A LITTLE POT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.049
WE ALL DID.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.354
I DIDN'T.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.018
I KNOW, RICO,
'CAUSE YOU WERE BORING.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.361
IT'S JUST WEIRD THAT KENNY'S
WHOLE FAMILY IS MOVING IN HERE.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.563
YOU'RE SO
RIDICULOUS.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.831
I'M A SINGLE PARENT,
I NEED HELP.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.068
JULIE'S A GOOD BABY SITTER
AND SHE'S COMING OVER TOMORROW.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.977
YOU'RE NOT
A SINGLE PARENT.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.240
I CAN WATCH
THE KIDS.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.499
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE
ALL THE TIME.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.441
SO, I HAVE TO KEEP
PAYING FOR A BABY SITTER ?

19:47.550 --> 19:49.848
I WORK AS MUCH
AS YOU DO.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.212
YOU'RE NOT PAYING
FOR ANYTHING.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.382
DON'T WE HAVE
ANY RICE ?

19:54.490 --> 19:56.412
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE
RISOTTO WITHOUT ANY RICE ?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.249
THAT'S WHAT RISOTTO IS,
IT'S RICE.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.827
SO, WE'LL HAVE PASTA.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.090
I DON'T WANT
FUCKING PASTA !

20:01.200 --> 20:03.327
DAVID, CALM DOWN.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.261
DON'T TELL ME
TO FUCKING CALM DOWN.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.928
WE'RE GOING
TO LOSE EVERYTHING.

20:07.030 --> 20:08.497
THIS LAWSUIT IS
GONNA BANKRUPT US.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.692
NO, IT'S NOT.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.869
YES, IT IS !

20:10.970 --> 20:13.370
MY LIABILITY INSURANCE
WON'T COVER ANY OF THIS.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.573
HE'S GOING TO SUE US
AND TAKE EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.136
THAT STUPID
MOTHER-FUCKER !

20:17.250 --> 20:20.310
DAVID, TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.389
NOW, HOLD IT IN.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.981
NOW, SLOWLY
LET IT OUT.

20:26.090 --> 20:28.650
DO IT AGAIN.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.285
FEEL YOURSELF RELAX.

20:31.390 --> 20:34.757
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON THE NEGATIVE,

20:34.860 --> 20:36.054
THINK POSITIVE THOUGHTS.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.195
DOES THAT INCLUDE
BEATING THE SHIT OUT

20:37.300 --> 20:38.528
OF ROGER FUCKING
PASQUESE ?

20:38.630 --> 20:42.532
LOOK, EVEN IF HE DOES
SUE US, WE'LL BE OKAY.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.505
HE CAN'T TAKE
ANYTHING OF MINE

20:44.610 --> 20:45.804
'CAUSE I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS,

20:45.910 --> 20:47.707
AND LEGALLY
HE HAS NO RIGHT.

20:47.810 --> 20:51.678
MAYBE THIS IS THE UPSIDE TO US
NOT BEING ABLE TO GET MARRIED.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.670
HE'S GOING TO TAKE MY
PART OF THE FUNERAL HOME

20:56.780 --> 20:58.543
AND GARNISH MY WAGES
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

20:58.650 --> 20:59.617
NO, HE WON'T.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.210
OF COURSE HE WILL,
HE WANTS REVENGE.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.424
YOU NOTICE, HE DIDN'T SAY
A WORD THE WHOLE MEETING.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.657
I THINK HIS LAWYER
IS PUTTING HIM UP TO THIS.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.728
HE'S PROBABLY
A REASONABLE GUY.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.525
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:09.630 --> 21:13.225
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TALKING
TO HIM AWAY FROM HIS LAWYER,

21:13.340 --> 21:14.932
SEE IF WE CAN
SETTLE THIS OURSELVES.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.439
HE'LL NEVER
AGREE TO IT.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.064
WELL, I'M GOING
TO CALL HIM TOMORROW.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.831
WE GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.914
The loving couples center
offers many different workshops.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.319
Whatever your needs, we're sure
you'll find one suited to you.

21:34.420 --> 21:35.910
Maybe even
more than one.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.419
Let's not
be pushy, Bob.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.725
I HOPE THOSE PEOPLE
AREN'T GOING TO BE THERE.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.321
I THINK THEY'RE JUST
CELEBRITY SPOKESPEOPLE.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.819
TH EY'RE
CELEBRITIES ?

21:44.930 --> 21:46.921
WHO ARE THEY ?

21:47.030 --> 21:48.566
I DON'T KNOW.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.729
MOM, CAN YOU COME
DOWNSTAIRS, PLEASE ?

21:50.840 --> 21:52.205
NOW ?

21:52.310 --> 21:54.369
sNOW WOULD BE GOO.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.941
THAT'S A LOT
OF WATER.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.142
YES, IT'S
A LOT OF WATER.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.410
WHAT IS IT
DOING IN THERE ?

22:00.520 --> 22:01.714
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY CREMAINS URNS ?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.811
I PUT THEM
IN THE SMALLER CLOSET.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.285
YOU DID THIS ?

22:05.390 --> 22:06.812
I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING
TO ORDER SOME EXTRA WATER.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.808
THIS IS A GOOD DEAL
MORE THAN I ANTICIPATED.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.559
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU UNDERSTOOD, RUTH.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.890
THIS IS ONLY THE BARE MINIMUM
OF WHAT YOU WOULD NEED

22:14.000 --> 22:15.228
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.649
I'M SORRY, BUT WE
CAN'T KEEP IT IN HERE.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.068
WELL, I CAN'T JUST PUT
IT OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.126
MAYBE ONE OF
THE SPARE BEDROOMS.

22:20.230 --> 22:21.834
FINE, JUST GET
IT OUT OF HERE.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.704
OR MAYBE THAT OLD BOMB
SHELTER WOULD BE BETTER.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.368
WHATEVER.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.200
YOU HAVE
A BOMB SHELTER ?

22:29.310 --> 22:32.871
AHH !

22:32.980 --> 22:34.379
BREN, STOP.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.777
MOM, I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.438
WELL, THEN GET ME
SOME MORE VICODIN.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.142
YOU JUST
HAD SOME.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.810
I TELL YOU WHAT I NEED,
AND YOU SAY NO.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.083
MOM, COULD YOU TRY AND JUST
BE A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE ?

22:45.190 --> 22:46.589
NO, DON'T BE
REASONABLE.

22:46.690 --> 22:47.793
BE AS MEAN
AS YOU WANT.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.798
LET IT ALL OUT.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.356
THANK YOU.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.688
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
GONNA BE, A NASTY OLD CRONE.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.430
NOW, THAT I'M
NO LONGER A WOMAN.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.837
MOM, THIS DOESN'T MAKE
YOU ANY LESS OF A WOMAN.

22:58.940 --> 23:00.669
OH REALLY ?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.407
THEN GIVE ME
YOUR UTERUS.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.671
HEY, HEY.

23:04.780 --> 23:10.639
MAYBE I SHOULD
COME BACK ?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.445
OF COURSE NOT,
HAVE A SEAT.

23:12.550 --> 23:15.610
YEAH, STAY.

23:15.720 --> 23:20.350
MOM, I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR FAVORITE FLOWERS.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.429
AS DID BRENDA.

23:23.530 --> 23:29.491
FLOWERS ARE FOR PRETTY GIRLS,
NOT SOMEONE LIKE ME.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.033
SHE'S NOT
A WOMAN ANYMORE.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.132
COME ON, YOU'RE STILL
YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.869
OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING
TO SAY NICE THINGS TO YOU.

23:37.980 --> 23:39.140
THEY'RE
YOUR KIDS.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.070
BUT ME, I'M A MISERABLE
PRICK WHO CARES NOTHING

23:41.180 --> 23:42.670
ABOUT ANYONE
BUT MYSELF,

23:42.780 --> 23:45.214
AND I LOOK AT YOU
IN YOUR HOSPITAL BED,

23:45.320 --> 23:49.484
TIRED AND WORN OUT FROM SURGERY,
AND I SELFISHLY WONDER HOW LONG

23:49.590 --> 23:53.151
MUST I WAIT BEFORE
I CAN FUCK YOU.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.588
WOW, FINALLY SOMEBODY
SAID SOMETHING RIGHT.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.464
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WEIRD IF I'D SAID IT.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.208
NOT IN
THIS FAMILY.

24:04.310 --> 24:08.735
DARLINGS, WOULD YOU PLEASE
GIVE US A LITTLE PRIVACY ?

24:08.840 --> 24:09.977
OH GOD.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.479
MOM, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO--

24:11.580 --> 24:15.141
I JUST WANT TO BE
WITH OLIVIER FOR A MINUTE.

24:15.250 --> 24:19.118
NOW GO.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.552
GO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

24:48.350 --> 24:49.339
LOOK AT ALL
THE FLOWERS.

24:49.450 --> 24:51.987
OOH,
A PLASTIC MONKEY.

24:56.420 --> 25:00.527
IT'S LIKE A PARADE
FLOAT WITHOUT THE PARADE.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.689
THESE FLOWERS
ARE AMAZING.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.995
IF THEY USED AN ACTUAL TIGER
THAT WOULD OCCASIONALLY

25:05.100 --> 25:09.537
MAIM AN INNOCENT PASSERBY,
THEN MAYBE I'D LIKE IT.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.604
AAHH !

25:12.710 --> 25:14.268
ISN'T IT
SAD THOUGH ?

25:14.380 --> 25:17.770
NOTHING WE CAN EVER CREATE WILL
BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS FLOWER ?

25:20.550 --> 25:21.949
I DON'T KNOW.

25:22.050 --> 25:24.348
THOSE LEGO DINOSAURS YOU MADE
WERE PRETTY FUCKING AMAZING.

25:24.450 --> 25:28.011
WHY ARE YOU SO
ABOVE EVERYTHING ?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.592
EXCUSE ME, BUT YOU
CAN'T DO THAT.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.760
IT'S OKAY, DICK CHENEY
IS MY UNCLE.

25:38.870 --> 25:42.328
HEY, WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM ?

25:42.440 --> 25:44.408
WHAT'S MY
PROBLEM ?

25:44.510 --> 25:46.660
I CAN'T FUCKING
BELIEVE YOU WOULD TRY

25:46.770 --> 25:47.839
TO TAKE CREDIT
FOR MY WORK.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.738
I WASN'T TAKING
CREDIT FOR YOUR WORK !

25:50.850 --> 25:53.478
I TOOK MY SHARE
OF CREDIT FOR OUR IDEA !

25:53.580 --> 25:56.014
OH, PLEASE.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.884
JESUS CHRIST, ARE YOU
REALLY THAT INSECURE

25:58.990 --> 26:00.412
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING ?

26:00.520 --> 26:02.909
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION.

26:03.020 --> 26:03.759
YEAH.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.418
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.624
YOU KNOW I TORE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
AND PUT THE PIECES ON YOUR FACE.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.425
THAT WAS THE IDEA.

26:10.530 --> 26:12.020
THAT WAS
THE FUCKING IDEA !

26:12.130 --> 26:14.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
TRY AND TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.038
YOU TORE
UP A PICTURE.

26:16.140 --> 26:17.061
BIG FUCKING DEAL !

26:17.170 --> 26:18.865
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD
YOU TO PHOTOGRAPH IT.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.062
I'M THE ONE WHO
SAW THE POTENTIAL.

26:20.170 --> 26:21.603
GREAT.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.974
SO, IF PICASSO PAINTED
A PICTURE IT WOULD BE ALRIGHT

26:24.080 --> 26:26.071
IF YOU TOOK PHOTOS OF IT AND
THEN TELL EVERYONE IT'S YOURS.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.614
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
COMPARE YOURSELF TO PICASSO.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.312
I WASN'T...

26:30.420 --> 26:32.843
LOOK, ONE OF
THE COOLEST THINGS

26:32.950 --> 26:36.852
ABOUT THIS WAS THAT
WE DID IT TOGETHER.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.724
I LIKED THAT,
JUST WORKING WITH YOU.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.424
EXCUSE ME,
YOUNG LADY !

26:42.530 --> 26:43.451
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.165
RUN !

26:46.270 --> 26:49.694
DID YOU
WANT SOUP ?

26:49.800 --> 26:53.167
NO, I ALWAYS HAVE SUCH
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS

26:53.270 --> 26:56.307
OF HOSPITAL SOUP, AND I'M
ALWAYS SO VERY DISAPPOINTED.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.140
THAN KS.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.751
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD PROBABLY--

27:08.860 --> 27:10.748
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.858
I WILL THOUGH.
I KNOW.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.825
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.459
YOU THINK I SHOULD
TELL MOM I SLEPT

27:23.570 --> 27:25.868
WITH OLIVIER
ONCE IN COLLEGE ?

27:28.110 --> 27:30.704
I KINDA WISH YOU
HADN'T TOLD ME.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.218
BUT IT WOULD BE FUN
TO SEE MOM'S REACTION.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.744
WE ARE THE MOST
SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE

27:38.850 --> 27:40.852
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,
AREN'T WE ?

27:40.960 --> 27:43.554
YEAH, WELL, LOOK
WHO OUR MOTHER IS.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.979
I DON'T THINK
WE HAD A CHOICE.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.955
YEAH, BUT IT'S A LITTLE
BIT TOO EASY TO BLAME HER

27:47.060 --> 27:48.357
FOR ALL MY
HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.927
OH, NO.

27:50.030 --> 27:52.123
IF YOU STOP BLAMING HER
I'LL HAVE TO DO THE SAME.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.767
MAYBE IT'S TIME.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.395
WHAT ABOUT DAD,
CAN WE BLAME HIM ?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.272
I'M THINKING
ABT HAVING KIDS.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.169
WITH NATE ?

28:09.280 --> 28:10.679
YEAH.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.289
YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY ?

28:15.390 --> 28:18.848
NO, NO,
NOT AT ALL.

28:20.430 --> 28:22.352
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

28:25.230 --> 28:27.835
I THINK YOU ARE GOING
TO BE A GREAT MOTHER.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.307
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

28:40.650 --> 28:43.210
NATHANIEL'S FATHER HAD IT BUILT
DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS.

28:43.320 --> 28:47.689
HIS MOTHER USED TO KEEP
HER CANNED GOODS IN HERE,

28:47.790 --> 28:50.918
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN
DOWN HERE IN AGES.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.488
THIS DOOR IS LINED
WITH LEAD.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.421
SEE, IT'S JUST
AN OLD--

28:57.530 --> 28:58.622
NOT A DROP
OF MOISTURE.

28:58.730 --> 29:02.097
SOMEBODY KNEW WHAT
THEY WERE DOING.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.468
THE BOYS USED
TO PLAY DOWN HERE.

29:07.570 --> 29:10.846
AND DAVID,
WHEN I'D SCOLD HIM,

29:10.950 --> 29:13.510
THIS WAS HIS LITTLE HIDEAWAY
PLACE TO SIT AND POUT.

29:13.610 --> 29:17.671
IT'S SO DUSTY.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.280
IT SM ELLS LIKE--

29:19.390 --> 29:20.414
LIFE.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.512
IT SMELLS
LIKE LIFE.

29:23.620 --> 29:27.795
YES, SIR, THIS'LL
DO JUST FINE.

29:30.730 --> 29:32.197
I ALWAYS PUT BLACK
ACTORS IN MY FILMS.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.860
EVEN IF THE PART DOESN'T
SAY IT'S A BLACK GUY,

29:34.970 --> 29:37.803
I ALWAYS THINK
WHY NOT A BLACK GUY.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.939
HMM.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.201
YOU EVER DO
ANY ACTING ?

29:43.310 --> 29:44.402
ME?

29:44.510 --> 29:45.807
NO.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.172
YOU SHOULD.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.419
YOU GOT A FACE
LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.443
DON'T YOU THINK
HE SHOULD BE IN MOVIES ?

29:52.550 --> 29:54.757
UH, SURE.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.886
I'M PRETTY HAPPY
DOING WHAT I'M DOING.

29:57.990 --> 30:02.029
MMM, EX-COP WHO BECOMES
A SECURITY SPECIALIST,

30:02.130 --> 30:05.361
THAT'S A MOVIE
RIGHT THERE.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.291
I LOVE COPS.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.492
( phone ringing )

30:09.600 --> 30:13.661
SORRY, THIS'LL JUST
TAKE A SECOND.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.271
YEAH ?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.779
CHECK ?

30:16.880 --> 30:20.748
OKAY, NOT ONLY IS HE SUING ME,
NOW HE'S HITTING ON MY HUSBAND.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.317
I'VE M SO MANY
GUYS LIKE HIM,

30:22.420 --> 30:24.388
WITH THEIR BIG BLACK
SEX COP FANTASIES.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.414
HE HASN'T THE FAINTEST
IDEA THAT I'M A REAL PERSON.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.819
I'M NOT SURE
HE CARES.

30:36.630 --> 30:37.597
I'LL PAY
THIS UP FRONT.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.759
NO, LET US
GET THAT.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.565
WHAT, YOU THINK YOU CAN
BUY ME OFF WITH A DINNER ?

30:41.670 --> 30:43.638
NO, I WAS JUST--

30:43.740 --> 30:44.707
IT'S NOT PERSONAL,
YOU KNOW, DAVID.

30:44.810 --> 30:46.505
BUT YOU REALLY
FUCKED UP.

30:46.610 --> 30:50.569
AND WELL,
SOMEONE'S GONNA PAY.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.478
DID HE JUST MAKE
US AN OFFER ?

31:02.860 --> 31:04.555
I THINK HE'LL
DROP THE LAWSUIT

31:05.560 --> 31:07.027
IF I LET
HIM BLOW ME.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.198
I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:17.740 --> 31:23.098
HEY, I HATE TO PLAY THE COP,
BUT I'M THINKING YOU'VE BEEN

31:23.210 --> 31:25.747
DRINKING AND I SHOULD
DRIVE YOU HOME.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.602
PLAY COP
ALL YOU WANT.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.116
IT'S A PORSCHE.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.956
FOLLOW US.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.482
YOU WORKING ON
A NEW ONE OF THESE ?

31:39.590 --> 31:40.557
YEAH.

31:40.660 --> 31:42.298
I REALLY LIKE
MAKING THEM.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.659
WHAT'S THE DEAL BETWEEN
YOU AND RUSSELL ?

31:45.770 --> 31:47.965
ANITA SAID HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT IT LIKE IT WAS HIS IDEA.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.061
I AM SO SICK
OF HIM.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.468
HE THINKS IT WAS HIS IDEA
BECAUSE HE WAS THERE WHEN WE--

31:52.570 --> 31:55.107
WHEN 1--
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

31:55.210 --> 31:56.609
I DON'T
GIVE A SHIT.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.143
DID HE HELP WITH ANY
OF THOSE PHOTOS YOU GAVE ME ?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.945
NO!

32:00.050 --> 32:01.779
HE WAS JUST THE ONE
WHO TORE UP THE FIRST PHOTO.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.348
SO, HE NEEDS
TO LAY OFF, THEN.

32:04.450 --> 32:07.214
LET HIM DO HIS OWN
THING WITH IT, JESUS.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.255
EVERYTHING'S
DERIVATIVE OF EVERYTHING.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.523
I JUST WISH HE WASN'T
CONNECTED TO IT IN ANY WAY.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.189
I SHOWED THEM
TO MY GALLERY MANAGER.

32:18.830 --> 32:20.195
REALLY ?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.329
HE WENT ALL
CRAZY OVER THEM.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.668
YOU'RE KIDDING ?

32:25.770 --> 32:27.362
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO MEET WITH YOU.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.301
HOLY FUCK !

32:29.410 --> 32:30.900
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DID THIS FOR ME.

32:31.010 --> 32:33.843
THANK YOU.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.247
THANK YOU.

32:35.350 --> 32:36.044
( giggling )

32:36.150 --> 32:38.983
( knocking )
( loud tv)

32:48.630 --> 32:49.699
WHO IS IT ?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.268
IT'S ME,
RICO.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.937
HEY, JULIE.

32:58.040 --> 33:01.737
WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.728
YEAH.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.774
WHERE ARE
THE KIDS ?

33:05.880 --> 33:06.949
ASLEEP.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.075
OH, OKAY.

33:09.180 --> 33:13.742
WELL, YOU
CAN GO NOW.

33:13.850 --> 33:15.613
WHAT ?

33:15.720 --> 33:17.984
I'M HERE,
YOU CAN GO NOW.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.558
YEAH, BUT VANESSA DIDN'T
SAY YOU WERE COMING BY.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.651
THEY'RE MY
KIDS TOO.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.198
( door shuts )

33:39.950 --> 33:42.339
ARAUCANAS, YOU REALLY
SHOULD GET SOME.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.281
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL CHICKENS.

33:44.390 --> 33:49.214
WE GOT FOUR RIGHT NOW, THERE'S
PETEY, PEPE, POLLY AND...

33:49.320 --> 33:51.550
POGO.

33:51.660 --> 33:52.524
POGO.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.258
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
ROOM FOR CHICKENS.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.791
LISA LOVED ANIMALS.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.131
DID ANYONE
WANT COFFEE ?

34:04.240 --> 34:05.798
SURE, I'LL
HAVE SOME.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.502
YEAH.

34:09.410 --> 34:10.968
SO, NATE, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TELL YOU WHY

34:11.080 --> 34:11.876
WE WANTED
TO SEE YOU.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.538
IT'S ABOUT LISA.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.674
HER ASHES.

34:14.780 --> 34:19.740
HOW COME THEY WEREN'T,
YOU KNOW, PROCESSED ?

34:21.020 --> 34:22.055
UH, WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

34:22.160 --> 34:24.321
THEY WERE
ALL CHUNKY.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.228
THEY WEREN'T
PULVERIZED.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.355
THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR
IN COEUR D'ALENE SAID

34:29.460 --> 34:30.654
IT WAS VERY
OLD-FASHIONED.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.796
HUH, I'M NOT
AWARE OF THAT.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.231
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU OVERSEE ?

34:34.340 --> 34:38.106
NO, NO, WE HAVE A REGULAR
CREMATORIUM THAT WE USE

34:38.210 --> 34:42.135
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN SOMETIMES

34:42.240 --> 34:43.468
I GUESS THEY JUST
RUSHED THE LAST STEP.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.378
THEN I WANT THEIR NUMBER
SO I CAN LOOK INTO THIS.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.277
OH, BARB, PLEASE
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

34:48.380 --> 34:51.247
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

34:51.350 --> 34:55.184
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THEY
MAY NOT EVEN BE LISA'S ASHES.

35:04.830 --> 35:07.719
OKAY, LOOK, I NEED TO TELL YOU
GUYS SOMETHING, I...

35:10.940 --> 35:12.532
I GAVE LISA
WHAT SHE WANTED.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.576
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

35:15.680 --> 35:20.174
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE CREMATED, SO, I...

35:22.280 --> 35:24.419
BURIED HER
IN THE DESERT.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.817
WHAT ?

35:25.920 --> 35:27.888
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU,
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.014
LESS COMPLICATED
THIS WAY.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.179
SO...

35:31.290 --> 35:33.656
THOSE AREN'T
EVEN LISA'S ASHES ?

35:33.760 --> 35:34.852
NO.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.359
WHOSE ARE THEY ?

35:36.460 --> 35:40.521
SOMEBODY'S ASHES THAT WERE
NEVER CLAIMED FROM THE 70's.

35:40.630 --> 35:42.268
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
DON'T PICK THEM UP.

35:42.370 --> 35:46.136
SO, IN LISA'S VAULT,
WITH HER NAME ON IT,

35:46.240 --> 35:49.903
WHERE MY PARENTS GO
TO VISIT HER AND PRAY,

35:50.010 --> 35:52.149
ARE SOME COMPLETE
STRANGER'S ASHES ?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.138
LOOK, I WANTED
TO HONOR HER--

35:54.250 --> 35:56.172
AND WHERE IS LISA ?

35:56.280 --> 35:58.441
THE DESERT,
WHAT DESERT ?

35:58.550 --> 36:00.188
THE MOJAVE.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.552
YOU JUST DUMPED HER BY
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SOMEWHERE ?

36:01.660 --> 36:04.527
NO, OF COURSE NOT,
I BURIED HER.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.052
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL
WHERE I BURIED HER.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.479
THERE'S
A TREE AND--

36:07.590 --> 36:09.990
WAS IT OFF THE 62
TOWARDS JOSHUA TREE ?

36:10.100 --> 36:12.068
NO, I DROVE OUT
TOWARD PALM SPRINGS--

36:12.170 --> 36:13.626
IS THERE
A MARKER ?

36:13.730 --> 36:15.038
HOW DO I
GO SEE HER ?

36:15.140 --> 36:16.789
DID YOU SEE ANY JOSHUA
TREES AROUND YOU ?

36:16.900 --> 36:18.538
THEY'RE THESE
SHORT LITTLE--

36:18.640 --> 36:19.902
I KNOW WHAT
A JOSHUA TREE IS.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.432
NO, THERE'S
NO MARKER, PER SE,

36:21.540 --> 36:23.633
LISA DIDN'T
WANT TO HAVE A--

36:23.740 --> 36:24.741
I'M SORRY.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.306
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
I WAS A LITTLE OUT OF IT.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.547
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE
COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.

36:27.650 --> 36:30.073
WHAT YOU DID IS
PROBABLY ILLEGAL, NATE,

36:30.180 --> 36:33.217
AND IT REALLY PISSES
ME OFF THAT YOU LIED TO US.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.083
LOOK, I GAVE HER WHAT
SHE WANTED, OKAY ?!

36:35.190 --> 36:37.249
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED TOO !

36:37.360 --> 36:39.885
NO, WHAT I WANT IS FOR
LISA TO STILL BE ALIVE,

36:39.990 --> 36:41.389
AND NOT HAVE HER
DAUGHTER BE RAISED

36:41.500 --> 36:42.649
BY A WOMAN
THAT SHE HATED !

36:42.760 --> 36:43.897
BARB.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.365
THIS IS FUCKED UP !

36:45.470 --> 36:47.426
YOU COMPLETELY ERASED HER
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

36:47.530 --> 36:49.293
LIKE SHE NEVER
EVEN EXISTED.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.130
THIS RAISES A LOT
OF QUESTIONS, NATE.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.502
WHAT QUESTIONS ?!

36:53.610 --> 36:55.134
THIS IS CRAZY, I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.777
COME ON, HOYT,
WE'RE LEAVING.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.284
IT RAISES A LOT
OF QUESTIONS, NATE.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.237
SO, YOU GONNA
DROP THE CHARGES ?

37:30.340 --> 37:33.070
YEAH, FORGET IT.

37:33.180 --> 37:34.943
I'LL CALL THE LAWYER
IN THE MORNING.

37:35.050 --> 37:37.746
BUT GET YOUR BOYFRIEND SOME
PROZAC OR A MUZZLE OR SOMETHING.

37:37.850 --> 37:40.387
HE JUST WENT THROUGH
A REALLY AWFUL EXPERIENCE

37:40.490 --> 37:42.185
AND IS HAVING PROBLEMS
DEALING WITH IT IS ALL.

37:42.290 --> 37:45.384
YEAH,
HOW ABOUT YOU ?

37:45.490 --> 37:49.449
ME, I'M TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR HIM.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.289
YOU KNOW,
BE STRONG.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.631
DOESN'T THAT GET
A LITTLE OLD ?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.469
NO.

37:56.570 --> 38:00.802
WELL, SOMETIMES
IT'S KIND OF...

38:04.010 --> 38:05.409
TELL ME.

38:07.150 --> 38:10.119
I UNDERSTAND HE WENT THROUGH
SOMETHING REALLY TRAUMATIC.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.448
I'M COMPLETELY
EMPATH ETIC.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.246
BUT SOMETIMES I DO GET
TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT IT.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.850
YOU'RE NOT
HIS MOTHER.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.313
I WISH HE WOULD FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT

38:17.420 --> 38:19.729
RATHER THAN HAVE
THESE EPISODES.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.823
WELL, AT LEAST I FINALLY
GOT HIM INTO THERAPY.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.867
THAT'S A LOT
FOR YOU TO HANDLE.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.188
YOU MUST BE
REAL TENSE.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.609
A LITTLE ANGRY.

38:32.710 --> 38:33.608
EXHAUSTED.

38:33.710 --> 38:34.631
IT'S LIKE LIVING
WITH AN INVALID.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.276
YEAH.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.975
YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYONE TO UNLOAD ON.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.744
THANKS, I'LL DEAL
WITH IT MY OWN WAY.

38:44.850 --> 38:49.753
REALLY, THOUGH, ANYTIME YOU
NEED TO LET OFF A LITTLE STEAM.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.681
I'M THINKING THIS IS
THE LAST TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.280
YEAH, I FIGURED.

38:54.400 --> 38:58.359
YOU BETTER GO FIND
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.064
BEFORE HE BITES
MY CAT OR SOMETHING.

39:10.410 --> 39:11.331
HOW WAS IT ?

39:11.450 --> 39:13.406
I NEED TO GET
HOME AND SHOWER.

39:18.850 --> 39:20.841
( phone ringing )

39:25.690 --> 39:26.759
HELLO ?

39:26.860 --> 39:28.919
YEAH, JULIE CALLED AND SHE
SAID YOU SENT HER HOME.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.590
I'M TIRED OF MY KIDS BEING
LEFT WITH SOME BABY SITTER

39:31.700 --> 39:33.167
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT
OF THE WEEK WHILE YOU

39:33.270 --> 39:34.692
GO OUT WITH
KENNY FUCKING SIMS.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.893
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
GODDAMNED BUSINESS WHAT I DO.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.265
AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE
MY KIDS WHENEVER I WANT.

39:40.370 --> 39:42.270
OH, YOU GOT
THE RIGHT ?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.438
ALRIGHT,OU CAN STAY
WITH THEM ALL NIGHT,

39:43.540 --> 39:45.041
'CAUSE I'M
NOT COMING HOME.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.159
LOOK, IT'S
WHAT SHE WANTED.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.818
ALRIGHT ?

39:57.920 --> 39:59.182
I UNDERSTAND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A
HIGHLY MEANINGFUL THING FOR YOU.

39:59.290 --> 40:01.429
I'M JUST...

40:01.530 --> 40:03.020
I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT
YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT

40:03.130 --> 40:06.065
YOU COULD SHARE SOMETHING
THAT MEANINGFUL WITH ME.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.728
OKAY, ONE ?

40:07.830 --> 40:09.661
I'M NOT YOUR FUCKING PATIENT,
SO STOP TALKING TO ME LIKE I AM.

40:09.770 --> 40:10.930
THAT'S VERY
CONSTRUCT IVE, NATE.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.009
AND TWO, WHAT I DID
WAS BETWEEN LISA AND ME.

40:17.410 --> 40:18.946
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I'M JUST UPSET.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.371
YEAH, WELL, IT REALLY SUCKS
THAT YOU KEEP THINGS FROM ME.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.608
UH-HUH, OKAY.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.312
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL ME, OKAY ?

40:29.420 --> 40:30.785
TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE
READY TO LET ME IN,

40:30.890 --> 40:32.357
AND MAKE ME PART
OF YOUR FUCKING LIFE.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.792
OH GOD.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.925
( door shuts )

40:39.170 --> 40:40.194
YOU GUYS HAVE
YOUR LUNCHES ?

40:40.300 --> 40:41.324
YES.

40:41.430 --> 40:42.829
I MADE YOU PEANUT
BUTTER AND JELLY.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.168
I KNOW YOU
LIKE IT.

40:44.270 --> 40:46.067
I MADE IT REALLY GOOD,
TOO, WITH EXTRA PEANUT BUTTER.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.501
HI MOMMY !

40:47.610 --> 40:50.135
HI, YOU GUYS ALL
READY FOR SCHOOL ?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.673
OKAY, JULIO.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.839
GO PUT YOUR BROTHER
IN THE CAR, OKAY ?

40:53.950 --> 40:55.212
AND BUCKLE HIM UP
IN HIS BABY SEAT.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.617
BYE !

40:56.720 --> 41:00.178
SO, DID YOU
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT ?

41:00.290 --> 41:01.655
VERY NICE.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.182
IT'S NICE TO BE WITH A MAN
WHO KNOWS HOW TO TREAT A LADY.

41:03.290 --> 41:05.383
REALLY ?

41:05.490 --> 41:07.355
SO WHAT DID
YOU GUYS DO ?

41:07.460 --> 41:08.427
YOU KNOW.

41:08.530 --> 41:10.020
CHARITY WORK.

41:10.130 --> 41:12.223
I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS.

41:12.330 --> 41:13.558
I'M COMING HOME.

41:13.670 --> 41:14.898
I AM COMING HOME.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.536
IF YOU EVER STEP FOOT
IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN

41:16.640 --> 41:17.834
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION
I'M CALLING THE COPS.

41:17.940 --> 41:19.737
THE COPS WON'T
DO ANYTHING.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.138
THIS IS STILL MY HOUSE, AND YOU
HAVE NO RIGHT TO KEEP ME OUT.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.275
I DON'T CARE.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.870
I'M STILL
CALLING THEM.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.005
AND I'LL LET YOU
EXPLAIN THAT TO THEM.

41:33.190 --> 41:34.555
NATE.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.887
BARB.

41:37.990 --> 41:39.628
HOYT AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING AND
WE'RE REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS.

41:39.730 --> 41:41.357
I DON'T WANT MAYA
GROWING UP IN THIS HOUSE.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.791
WHAT ?

41:42.900 --> 41:44.697
WE DON'T WANT HER IN A PLACE
WHERE LISA ISN'T HONORED.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.598
LOOK, BARB, I KNOW THIS
IS REALLY WEIRD FOR YOU--

41:47.700 --> 41:48.689
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
A WORD FROM YOU !

41:48.800 --> 41:49.960
I KNOW ALL
ABOUT YOU !

41:50.070 --> 41:51.264
HEY, YOU'RE
COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

41:51.370 --> 41:52.598
WE WANT MAYA
TO COME LIVE WITH US.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.270
YEAH, WELL,
NO FUCKING WAY !

41:55.380 --> 41:56.472
MAYBE JUST
PART TIME--

41:56.580 --> 41:57.478
WHAT ARE YOU
PEOPLE, CRAZY ?

41:57.580 --> 41:59.070
NO, BUT
APPARENTLY YOU ARE.

41:59.180 --> 42:00.340
THE LAST TIME I CAME HERE
YOU SAID SOME PSYCHIC TOLD YOU

42:00.450 --> 42:01.644
LISA WAS
STILL ALIVE--

42:01.750 --> 42:03.308
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WAS STILL IN SHOCK,

42:03.420 --> 42:04.682
I THINK, OKAY

42:04.790 --> 42:06.644
ANYWAY I WAS HIGH.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.548
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU DID WITH LISA WAS WRONG,

42:09.660 --> 42:11.457
AND I HATE TO
CONTACT OUR LAWYER

42:11.560 --> 42:13.448
BUT IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES--
MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

42:13.560 --> 42:14.697
GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE !

42:14.800 --> 42:16.927
GO, GET THE FUCK
OFF MY PROPERTY !

42:17.030 --> 42:18.019
CALM DOWN NOW, NATE.

42:18.130 --> 42:19.495
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR MAYA.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.726
OH PLEASE, YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT MAYA.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.036
NOW, GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE !

42:22.140 --> 42:23.539
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET
AWAY WITH THIS, NATE !

42:23.640 --> 42:25.130
YOU'RE NOT !

42:29.740 --> 42:31.002
DON'T YOU
WORRY, BABY.

42:31.110 --> 42:33.169
DON'T YOU WORRY, NOBODY'S
GOING TO TAKE YOU AWAY.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.508
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

42:34.620 --> 42:35.917
THERE'S NO WAY.

42:36.020 --> 42:37.749
IT'S NOT LIKE
ENOUGH BAD SHIT

42:37.850 --> 42:38.987
HASN'T HAPPENED
TO ME ALREADY.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.580
SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY
NO LEGAL RIGHTS.

42:40.690 --> 42:41.918
I MEAN, WHO THE HELL
AM I, JOB ?

42:42.020 --> 42:44.159
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT SHE CAN TAKE MAYA.

42:44.260 --> 42:46.478
I'M NOT TAKING
HER TO DAYCARE.

42:46.590 --> 42:48.057
LEAVE HER WITH ME.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.923
I HAVE ONE CLASS THIS
MORNING, I CAN SKIP IT.

42:50.030 --> 42:51.395
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
I DON'T WANT TO LET HER GO.

42:51.500 --> 42:54.424
HEY, JUST COME
INSIDE FOR A WHILE.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.669
EVERYTHING
WILL BE OKAY.

42:56.770 --> 42:58.635
JUST COME IN
FOR A MINUTE.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.201
BEAUTIFUL, CLAIRE.

43:03.310 --> 43:05.972
COMPLEX.

43:08.050 --> 43:09.574
ALLURING.

43:12.450 --> 43:14.281
AND THEY'RE
FUCKING CREEPY.

43:16.090 --> 43:17.978
I LOVE 'EM.

43:18.090 --> 43:19.785
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE CONCEPT ?

43:21.060 --> 43:23.426
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE DONE
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID.

43:23.530 --> 43:24.758
TEARING THINGS UP.

43:24.870 --> 43:27.794
A GENIUS FROM BIRTH.

43:29.500 --> 43:30.933
WELL...

43:31.040 --> 43:35.204
I HAVE A NEW SHOW
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

43:36.510 --> 43:37.477
LET'S PUT 'EM IN.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.706
REALLY ?

43:38.810 --> 43:40.539
ALL OF THEM ?

43:40.650 --> 43:44.211
OH FUCK, YES,
ALL OF THEM.

43:48.350 --> 43:50.181
THAT'S GREAT !

43:50.290 --> 43:51.780
SHIT.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.926
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

43:54.030 --> 43:58.126
MY FAMILY IS GONE AND NO ONE
CAEVER REPLACE THEM.

44:00.630 --> 44:02.359
BUT THIS IS WHAT
LIFE IS, RIGHT ?

44:04.140 --> 44:05.801
PAIN.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.904
PAIN FOLLOWED
BY MORE PAIN.

44:11.780 --> 44:13.668
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
CAN BE TAKEN AWAY.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.919
AND IT WILL BE,
YOU KNOW THAT.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.756
LISA WAS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

44:21.860 --> 44:24.454
I MEAN, YOU'RE CRAZY TO EVEN
THINK OF HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.720
'CAUSE I PROMISE YOU,

44:25.830 --> 44:27.855
FROM NOW ON...

44:27.960 --> 44:32.090
ONLY BAD THINGS
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.

44:32.970 --> 44:33.925
HAVE YOU
SEEN GEORGE ?

44:34.030 --> 44:35.759
NO.

44:35.870 --> 44:37.929
I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.507
THEY WERE SO MUCH
A PART OF ME

44:39.610 --> 44:41.737
THAT I NEVER IMAGINED
LIFE WITHOUT THEM.

44:42.980 --> 44:46.177
BUT AS DEEPLY SAD AS
I AM THAT THEY'RE GONE...

44:46.280 --> 44:47.679
GEORGE ?

44:47.780 --> 44:49.213
I'M DOWN HERE !

44:50.450 --> 44:51.781
OH MY.

44:51.890 --> 44:54.347
THE EXTENSION CORD'S
ONLY TEMPORARY, OF COURSE.

44:54.450 --> 44:58.159
WE'RE GONNA NEED AT LEAST
A 5,000 WATT GENERATOR.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.581
I JUST GOT A CALL THAT
THERE'S BEEN A CANCELLATION

45:00.690 --> 45:02.226
IN THE TANTRIC
LOVING WORKSHOP.

45:02.330 --> 45:05.026
THEY CAN FIT US IN
THIS WEEKEND IF WE'D LIKE.

45:05.130 --> 45:06.165
THIS WEEKEND ?

45:06.270 --> 45:07.862
YES, THIS WEEKEND.

45:07.970 --> 45:09.494
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.761
I'VE GOT THIS GUY COMING OVER
FIRST THING SATURDAY MORNING

45:11.870 --> 45:13.508
WHO'S GOING
TO GIVE ME SOME ADVICE

45:13.610 --> 45:16.078
ON THE AIR
FILTRATION SYSTEM.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.642
OH GEEZ,
I'M NOT SURE.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.218
IT'S NOT THE SORT
OF THING YOU WANT TO RUSH

45:22.320 --> 45:23.344
NOW, IS IT ?

45:23.450 --> 45:24.940
I DON'T KNOW.

45:25.050 --> 45:28.144
I WAS THINKING HAMMOCKS
AGAINST THIS WALL,

45:28.250 --> 45:30.081
HOW'S THAT SOUND ?

45:41.870 --> 45:43.132
WHAT'S WITH
THE BABY MONITOR ?

45:43.240 --> 45:45.959
I FEEL SAFER KNOWING
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE.

45:48.740 --> 45:49.775
I DON'T TRUST BARB.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.939
OH COME ON,
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D--

45:52.050 --> 45:53.039
I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D
DO ANYTHING WEIRD OR CRAZY,

45:53.150 --> 45:54.811
BUT SHE ALREADY HAS,
HASN'T SHE ?

45:54.920 --> 45:57.741
I THINK BARB IS STILL TRYING
TO DEAL WITH LISA'S DEATH,

45:57.850 --> 46:00.341
AND IT'S DRIVING HER
A LITTLE WHACKO IS ALL.

46:00.450 --> 46:01.747
YOU CAN RELATE.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.953
I DON'T CARE WHAT
SHE'S GOING THROUGH,

46:04.060 --> 46:05.152
SHE'S NEVER
SEEING MAYA AGAIN.

46:05.260 --> 46:07.387
I'M SURE THIS WILL
ALL BLOW OVER.

46:07.490 --> 46:09.924
JUST LET HER
WORK THROUGH IT.

46:10.030 --> 46:11.827
WELL, WHEN SOMEONE
THREATENS MY FAMILY

46:11.930 --> 46:13.864
THEY DON'T GET TO WORK
THROUGH ANYTHING.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.828
YOUR FAMILY IS
GOING TO BE FINE.

46:21.610 --> 46:22.929
I PROMISE.

46:25.010 --> 46:27.308
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY

46:27.410 --> 46:29.514
NOT A GOOD TIME FOR US
TO HAVE A BABY, SO...

46:31.850 --> 46:34.114
I'M JUST SAYING.

46:34.220 --> 46:37.348
I'M SORRY, BUT WE GOTTA FOCUS
ON MAYA RIGHT NOW, JUST MAYA.

46:51.840 --> 46:55.105
( door opens and shuts )

46:56.110 --> 46:57.975
OH MAN,
WHAT A DAY.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.878
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
I SPENT THE LAST SIX HOURS

47:00.980 --> 47:03.619
STANDING OUTSIDE THIS JAPANESE
BUSINESSMAN'S HOTEL ROOM,

47:03.720 --> 47:04.982
AND THEN FOUND OUT
HE WASN'T EVEN IN THERE.

47:05.090 --> 47:08.856
DID YOU MAKE
ANYTHING FOR DINNER ?

47:08.960 --> 47:11.019
I'M STARVING.

47:14.330 --> 47:15.991
OH, SHIT.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.226
I'M GONNA
FUCKING KILL HIM.

47:17.330 --> 47:19.264
HE PROMISED
HE'D DROP THE LAWSUIT.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.564
IT'S NOT THAT.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.833
THEN WHAT IS IT ?

47:25.070 --> 47:26.867
THE POLICE CALLED.

47:26.970 --> 47:30.098
THEY ARRESTED SOMEONE
WHOSE FINGER PRINTS MATCH

47:30.210 --> 47:31.700
THE ONES TAKEN
FROM THE VAN.

47:31.810 --> 47:33.573
I HAVE TO GO IN
AND IDENTIFY HIM.
