"This is a whiteboard."

Frankie, what do we say
when someone gives us a gift?

00:54.555 --> 00:57.478
Do you have the receipt?

00:57.478 --> 01:00.481
The whiteboard is
for your "Draw My Life" video,

01:00.481 --> 01:01.732
where you draw
your life stories

01:01.732 --> 01:03.564
so your fans can learn
more about you.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.065
I love "Draw My Life,"

01:05.065 --> 01:07.688
but is Bizaardvark big enough
to do one of those?

01:07.688 --> 01:09.820
Apparently.
One of your fans requested it.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.861
Who?

01:10.861 --> 01:12.153
Me!

01:12.153 --> 01:14.325
I want to learn
more about you.

01:14.325 --> 01:15.456
Why didn't you just ask?

01:15.456 --> 01:18.749
I didn't want to have
a whole conversation.

01:18.749 --> 01:21.372
I'd respond,
but you'd probably
just cut me--

01:21.372 --> 01:23.544
Anyway...

01:23.544 --> 01:25.966
you have to do
a "Draw My Life"!

my "DML."

01:30.301 --> 01:32.843
Amelia: I was born
 on my family's farm.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.385
We didn't have
 a lot of money,

01:34.385 --> 01:36.217
but I loved pretty things.

01:36.217 --> 01:38.559
So, I made blush
 out of cherries

01:38.559 --> 01:40.431
and dresses
 out of old curtains.

01:41.982 --> 01:43.434
I wanted
 to show other girls

01:43.434 --> 01:45.356
they could also make a lot
 from of a little.

01:45.356 --> 01:48.149
So, when I was seven,
 I started making videos.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.610
-(oinking)
 -There weren't a lot
 of kids around,

01:49.610 --> 01:51.031

I said "blah, blah, blah"
instead of "three million fans"

02:00.241 --> 02:02.203
'cause I didn't want
to sound braggy.

02:03.204 --> 02:05.125
Mission accomplished!

Wow, Amelia,

Oh, you wanted
to tell me your--

05:50.891 --> 05:52.603
Okay.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.066
When I was a little kid,

05:56.066 --> 05:57.778
I used to be afraid
of everything.

05:57.778 --> 05:59.820
So, I created
an alter ego,

05:59.820 --> 06:01.942
DareMeBro, to help me
overcome my fears.

06:01.942 --> 06:03.444
And it worked.

06:03.444 --> 06:06.827
But there's one fear that
I've never been able to conquer.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.288
Turtles!

06:08.288 --> 06:11.662
Whoa, your breath is fresh!

06:11.662 --> 06:15.876
Wait, you're afraid
of turtles?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.799
It all began back when
I was just a tiny bro.

06:18.799 --> 06:21.211
My dad ran
a pre-owned turtle store.

06:21.211 --> 06:22.553
Sometimes...

06:22.553 --> 06:24.555
he brought work home.

06:24.555 --> 06:26.767
One night,
 it was tub-tub time

06:26.767 --> 06:28.969
and I got in the tub
 without checking first.

06:28.969 --> 06:31.642
And I didn't realize
 that it had been invaded

06:31.642 --> 06:34.975
by a gigantic
 reptilian monster!

06:36.276 --> 06:37.818
-(snap)
-Young Dirk: Yow!

06:37.818 --> 06:39.520
The turtle bit
my butt-butt!

07:34.835 --> 07:35.836
and about
who we really are.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.788
Uh, let's start
at the beginning.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.630
We were both born
in Tarzana.

07:39.630 --> 07:40.881
Have you traveled anywhere?

07:40.881 --> 07:43.343
I once visited my aunt
in East Tarzana.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.926
Okay, that's a dead end.

07:45.926 --> 07:48.468
Amelia overcame
obstacles in her life.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.930
Have we overcome anything?

07:49.930 --> 07:52.392
Ooh, remember
when we tried out
for the volleyball team

07:52.392 --> 07:54.394
but we got cut?
And then with a lot

07:54.394 --> 07:55.976
of hard work
and determination,

07:55.976 --> 07:58.519
we convinced ourselves
that volleyball's stupid.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.271
Forget the past.

08:01.271 --> 08:02.482
We're interesting now!

08:02.482 --> 08:04.154
Like what did we do
last Friday?

08:04.154 --> 08:05.986
We threw rocks
into your dad's pool.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.107
Hm.

08:07.107 --> 08:08.488
And what did we do
on Saturday?

08:08.488 --> 08:12.663
Your dad made us clean
the rocks out of his pool.

08:12.663 --> 08:14.284
This is awful.

08:14.284 --> 08:15.826
Our fans are gonna see
who we really are

08:15.826 --> 08:17.377
for the first time,
and compared

08:17.377 --> 08:18.919
to everyone else
at Vuuugle, we're lame.

08:18.919 --> 08:20.791

something to make

08:20.791 --> 08:22.292

more interesting

09:25.445 --> 09:26.987
across the country
to find each other.

09:26.987 --> 09:29.860
Once they reunited,
they bought a three-person bike

09:29.860 --> 09:32.863
as a symbol
they'd never be apart again.

09:33.954 --> 09:35.786
Ours has a bell.
(chuckles awkwardly)

09:35.786 --> 09:37.037
(bell dings)

09:37.037 --> 09:39.459
I'm gonna go
return this bike.

09:39.459 --> 09:40.500
(grunts)

09:40.500 --> 09:43.123
Stupid parents
not separating me at birth.

09:45.165 --> 09:46.376
I don't know what to do.

09:46.376 --> 09:48.969
I'm worried our "DML"
is gonna be horrible.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.921
Oh, you mean
because you're doing

09:50.921 --> 09:52.092
a two-person
"Draw My Life,"

09:52.092 --> 09:54.675
so one person will come off
more interestin' than the other?

09:54.675 --> 09:55.886
What?

09:55.886 --> 09:58.098
No, I-- I wasn't thinking
about that at all.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.559
Oh, good.
You shouldn't.

09:59.559 --> 10:02.893
Your "DML" is
going to be awesome...

10:02.893 --> 10:05.646
no matter which one
of you is more interestin'.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.987
(majestic music playing)

10:06.987 --> 10:08.989
(cameras clicking)

10:08.989 --> 10:11.111
Whiteboard reporter:
Frankie! Saw the "DML."

10:11.111 --> 10:12.612
Love your part.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.695
Tell us again
how you got so interesting.

10:14.695 --> 10:17.407
Whiteboard Frankie:
Well, the dictionary
defines "interesting" as--

10:17.407 --> 10:18.659
Whiteboard Paige:
My dad has a pool!

10:18.659 --> 10:19.870
Nobody cares!

10:19.870 --> 10:21.451
Go home
and throw rocks in it.

10:21.451 --> 10:22.542
Frankie's talking!

10:22.542 --> 10:24.374
(cameras clicks)

10:24.374 --> 10:26.877
Well, I'm glad I helped.

10:26.877 --> 10:27.838
Bye!

10:31.251 --> 10:33.013
Bernie?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.718
(tranquil music plays)

10:37.718 --> 10:39.259
Bernie:
Namaste, Dirk.

10:39.259 --> 10:40.891
This is your mentor

10:40.891 --> 10:43.894
and cooler friend
 Bernie Schotz.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.026
Today, we're using meditation

10:46.026 --> 10:48.478
to get you over
 your fear of turtles.

10:48.478 --> 10:49.609
Have a seat, chief.

10:49.609 --> 10:51.571
Or do you prefer "tiger"?

10:51.571 --> 10:52.652
Tiger, I guess.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.074
You got it, chief!

10:55.325 --> 10:57.537
Now close your eyes.

10:57.537 --> 11:02.082
Imagine a meadow
 with trees and butterflies.

11:02.082 --> 11:03.543
Ah.

11:03.543 --> 11:06.246
Hey, butterfly bro.

11:06.246 --> 11:07.788
There's also a pond,

11:07.788 --> 11:10.170
and in that pond
 is a little turtle.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.341
Aah!

11:11.341 --> 11:13.503
You're right,
 this is fun!

11:14.965 --> 11:16.176
The turtle's your friend.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.007
Say hello.

11:17.007 --> 11:20.390
He-- hello, Mr. Turtle.

11:21.391 --> 11:23.934
Wow. Okay.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.806
I think this might
actually be working.

11:25.806 --> 11:28.228
Now open your eyes
 and press "play"
 on that tablet

11:28.228 --> 11:29.980
to see playful
 snapping turtles

11:29.980 --> 11:31.651
in their natural habitat.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.694
(happy music playing)

11:35.736 --> 11:36.777
-(snap)
-(videographer screams)

11:36.777 --> 11:37.988
(screams)

11:37.988 --> 11:40.030
(high-pitched)
No! No snapping turtles!

11:40.030 --> 11:41.581
(normal voice)
Die, turtle!

11:42.743 --> 11:45.125
(grunts)

11:45.125 --> 11:48.248
Congratulations!
 You're cured!

11:48.248 --> 11:49.669
Please return the tablet.

11:49.669 --> 11:51.131
It's my grandma's.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.258
Paige, Paige, Paige!

11:58.258 --> 12:00.470
How interesting
does this sound?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.933
We wear astronaut suits
all the time.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.476
(squawks)

12:06.476 --> 12:08.108
Uh, follow up question.

12:08.108 --> 12:10.230
Why do you have a parrot
on your shoulder?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.813
Oh, this guy?
His name's Levon.

12:12.813 --> 12:14.855
I thought he would
make us more interesting.

12:14.855 --> 12:16.066
Now we're the comedy duo

12:16.066 --> 12:17.567
who has a parrot
on our shoulder.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.119
Cool. When do
I get to wear him?

12:19.119 --> 12:20.570
(squawks)

12:20.570 --> 12:21.621
Oh, you don't.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.073
He's kind of my parrot.

12:23.073 --> 12:24.454
Oh.

12:27.627 --> 12:29.079
You guys got parrots

12:29.079 --> 12:30.791
for your "Draw My Life"?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.042
So smart!

12:32.042 --> 12:33.373
Actually, only Paige got one.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.504
Oh.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.217
Well, don't freak out about it.
You'll be fine.

12:37.217 --> 12:39.219
I wasn't freaking out.

12:39.219 --> 12:40.380
Should I be?

12:40.380 --> 12:41.471
No.

12:41.471 --> 12:43.473
I'm sure you'll think
of some way to be

12:43.473 --> 12:45.806
as interesting as Paige
in your "DML"...

12:45.806 --> 12:47.517
even without a parrot.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.982
What do you mean,
"as interesting as Paige"?

12:54.104 --> 12:57.157
Okay, sport,
to get you over
your fear of turtles,

12:57.157 --> 12:59.529
we're gonna relive the moment
where it all started.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's that?

13:02.993 --> 13:05.115
Little Sheldon here
is your friend.

13:05.115 --> 13:06.246
Aren't you, Sheldon?

13:06.246 --> 13:07.287
(toy squeaks)

13:07.287 --> 13:08.578
What did he say?

13:08.578 --> 13:10.620
I don't trust him!

13:10.620 --> 13:13.083
Just relax.
Sheldon's gonna be

13:13.083 --> 13:15.175
all the way over here,

13:15.175 --> 13:17.878
and you two are
gonna work things out.

13:19.179 --> 13:21.091
I'll come back
and check on you.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.844

13:31.982 --> 13:34.434
(scoffs)
You're just a toy.

13:34.434 --> 13:36.146
I'm not scared.

13:37.487 --> 13:38.989
Whoa!

13:38.989 --> 13:41.361
Close enough, tough guy!

13:41.361 --> 13:43.403
Okay. Good.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.155
Deep breath...

13:47.537 --> 13:49.950

isn't so bad after all.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.609
for you to do
the snapping turtle dare.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.191
Just do the dare.

-You can!

Let me have this, Frankie!

17:25.375 --> 17:27.297
I need it
for the "Draw My Life"
more than you do!

17:27.297 --> 17:30.380
No way! My life is way less
interesting than yours!

17:30.380 --> 17:32.262
Less interesting?
Throwing rocks

17:32.262 --> 17:34.264
in my dad's pool
was the highlight
of my month!

17:34.264 --> 17:36.846
The highlight of my month
was cleaning up the rocks!

17:39.559 --> 17:42.442
I went to a fortune teller
and she fell asleep!

17:42.442 --> 17:45.485
I read my own diary
and I fell asleep!

17:46.356 --> 17:49.489
Well, I go to a stuffy,
boring prep school!

17:49.489 --> 17:51.401

to the same school!

17:53.032 --> 17:54.614
-Go back!
-I can't go back!

18:23.183 --> 18:24.644
Dirk, what are you doing?

18:24.644 --> 18:25.985
Quitting, Bern-man.

18:25.985 --> 18:28.438
You tried,
but this is a dare
I just can't do.

18:28.438 --> 18:29.609
You can't quit.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.151
I have to.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.233
And I want you to have
some of my things.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.616
But you're an inspiration
to so many viewers.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.158
If you quit the--

18:38.158 --> 18:39.499
Ooh, this is nice.

18:39.499 --> 18:40.830
I can keep this?

18:42.162 --> 18:44.414
I promised my fans
I'd be DareMeBro.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.505
Not...

Dare-Me-But-Not-
If-It's-Turtles... Bro.

18:49.299 --> 18:53.213
So now,
for the last time...

18:53.213 --> 18:54.924
here we go.

18:54.924 --> 18:57.517
No. I can't let you do this.

18:57.517 --> 18:58.558
You're an icon,

18:58.558 --> 19:00.470
a national hero.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.061
You show people that--

19:02.061 --> 19:03.523
Is this a cape?

19:03.523 --> 19:05.855
I have always wanted a cape!

19:07.317 --> 19:08.608
I mean, uh...

19:08.608 --> 19:10.109
your presence...

19:10.109 --> 19:13.152
is a hero... something.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.154
I'm sorry,
all of this is mine?

19:16.616 --> 19:19.078
And anything else
you want in here.

19:19.078 --> 19:20.580
Unless...

19:20.580 --> 19:22.372
you really think
I should stay.

19:22.372 --> 19:24.834
Nah, seems like you got
this all figured out.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.376
Best of luck, old friend.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.092
I can't believe this is
how we're gonna die!

19:33.092 --> 19:34.504
Can someone call
for help?

19:34.504 --> 19:35.595
I'm on it!

19:36.676 --> 19:38.968
Yes, help,
my two friends are--

19:38.968 --> 19:41.261
Hang on, I'm gettin'
another call.

19:41.261 --> 19:42.642
Hello?

19:42.642 --> 19:45.605
Yes, this is Amelia.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.477
You do have the sweater?

19:47.477 --> 19:49.188
Sure, I'll hold.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.312
(both scream)

19:54.023 --> 19:55.485
I'm sorry, Frankie.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.616
This is all my fault.

19:56.616 --> 19:58.618
I was afraid you were
more interesting than me.

19:58.618 --> 20:01.120
Are you kidding me?
You're so funny and weird.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.122
I was afraid you were
more interesting than me!

20:03.122 --> 20:04.534
You know what I wish
we did more of?

20:04.534 --> 20:06.416
Convince each other
that we're more interesting

20:06.416 --> 20:08.628
so we never compare ourselves
to other people or each other?

20:08.628 --> 20:11.461
Yeah, that,
and also pull-ups!

20:11.461 --> 20:12.502
(both scream)

20:17.046 --> 20:18.718
(audience gasps)

20:18.718 --> 20:20.390
(screams)

20:22.051 --> 20:24.804
This cape's working already!

20:24.804 --> 20:27.226
I'm coming
for you, chick-dudes!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.478
Here we go!

20:28.478 --> 20:30.109
(heroic music plays)

20:53.212 --> 20:54.374
Hey!

20:54.374 --> 20:56.676
There aren't any turtles
in here!

20:58.678 --> 20:59.589
You're right!

20:59.589 --> 21:03.553
Yeah, um, about
the snapping turtles...

21:03.553 --> 21:05.805
they're really expensive.

21:05.805 --> 21:08.057
So, I just used
an air hose

21:08.057 --> 21:10.600
to create
a terrifying simulation.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.772
Vuuuglers: What?

21:12.772 --> 21:15.194
Either way, I'm proud
of you, Dirk.

21:15.194 --> 21:16.656
Conquered your fear.

21:16.656 --> 21:18.358
I guess I did,
didn't I?

21:18.358 --> 21:21.070
And all because I jumped in
without thinking.

21:21.070 --> 21:24.744
I guess the lesson is,
"Think less."

21:24.744 --> 21:26.826
Wait, if there aren't any
turtles in here,

21:26.826 --> 21:28.287
then how'd that ham
get ripped apart?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.459
Oh, easy.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.541
I just put
a baby tiger shark
in the tank.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.752
All: What?

21:34.964 --> 21:36.546
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

21:36.546 --> 21:37.677
-Hey, guys!
-Hi!

21:37.677 --> 21:39.629
We're Bizaardvark,
and we're excited

21:39.629 --> 21:40.970
to show you
our "Draw My Life."

21:40.970 --> 21:42.762
(mimics echo)
Life-life-life.

21:45.014 --> 21:47.347
Paige:
 All my life,
I've felt like an outsider.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.808
Frankie:
 So did I.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.059
Is that supposed to be you?

21:50.059 --> 21:51.771
Fine, you draw the rest.

21:53.142 --> 21:54.854
Frankie and I met
in music class.

21:54.854 --> 21:57.026
I liked Paige right away
 'cause she said,

21:57.026 --> 21:59.819
"How funny would it be
 if we smashed our guitars
 right now?"

21:59.819 --> 22:01.741
And I liked Frankie
'cause she did it.

22:01.741 --> 22:04.364
(electric guitar smashing)

22:04.364 --> 22:06.706
So, after
 we got kicked out
 of the orchestra,

22:06.706 --> 22:08.618
we started making
 videos together.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.209
And "Bizaardvark!"
was formed!

22:10.209 --> 22:11.711
Power chord!

22:11.711 --> 22:12.832
(electric guitar power chord)

22:12.832 --> 22:14.414
Sorry, had to get that in.

22:15.955 --> 22:18.668
And now I get to spend
every day laughing

22:18.668 --> 22:20.420
with the most interesting
person I know.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.722
Aww! That's how
 I feel about you!

22:22.722 --> 22:24.804
And you see this
blank space on the whiteboard?

22:24.804 --> 22:27.427
That's for all
the cool stuff
we're gonna do together.

22:27.427 --> 22:28.808
Also, for a while,

22:28.808 --> 22:30.560
I had really pointy boots.

22:32.682 --> 22:33.683
Bizaardvark.

22:34.305 --> 22:40.487
