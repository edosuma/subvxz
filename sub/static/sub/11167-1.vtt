01:55.532 --> 01:56.988
Mr. Blackwood?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.118
Sir?

02:35.155 --> 02:39.068
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?

02:39.743 --> 02:40.732
Come down.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.409
I'm so...

03:28.583 --> 03:31.245
So very sorry.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.210
I didn't see the steps.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.628
They made me do it.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.917
I didn't...

03:41.263 --> 03:43.470
If I want to see my child again,

03:44.808 --> 03:45.923
I must comply.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.132
Mr. Blackwood.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.592
Please understand.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.461
Precious teeth. Beautiful teeth.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.092
Ransom for my boy.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.513
Yes.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.566
Daddy.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.677
I brought you something more to eat.

05:11.478 --> 05:15.221
Not children's teeth like you wanted,

05:16.233 --> 05:19.441
but please accept them

05:20.362 --> 05:22.318
in exchange for him.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.147
Children's teeth.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.160
Oh, no, that's the best I could do.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.493
And they're my own. You see?

05:34.251 --> 05:35.411
My own.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.749
Please. Give me back my son!

05:39.965 --> 05:44.254
Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.885
Son? Son!

05:48.557 --> 05:49.546
Son!

05:50.517 --> 05:51.597
Grab my hand!

07:45.632 --> 07:48.339
<i>We've now begun our descent</i>
<i>into T.F. Green Airport.</i>

07:48.510 --> 07:50.546
<i>Please return to your seat,</i>
<i>make sure it is in...</i>

08:01.356 --> 08:02.391
She's landed.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.765
What do you think? Too much?

08:05.860 --> 08:08.567
No, it's perfect. Just like you.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.688
There's my girl.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.815
Sally?

08:14.703 --> 08:17.786
Wow! Look how tall you are!

08:18.581 --> 08:19.787
What are you, 17 now?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.830
Dad, you know how old I am.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.283
I know. I'm being silly.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.913
- Hey.
- Good morning, sir.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.128
Thank you.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.337
Come on.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.416
Sally, this is Kim. Kim, Sally.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.009
Hi, Sally. It's nice to meet you.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.176
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

08:38.768 --> 08:39.756
Thanks.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.015
What about a picture?
You got your camera?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.563
It's good to see you.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.276
<i>Good morning, Rhode Island!</i>

08:54.451 --> 08:56.282
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.573
<i>We've got fog this morning</i>
<i>and a slight chance of a shower later on.</i>

08:59.748 --> 09:00.988
Smell that fresh air, kiddo?

09:01.249 --> 09:02.955
Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?

09:14.304 --> 09:15.384
I have to call Mom now.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.968
Just press one and the green.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.606
<i>Hi, you've called Joanne</i>
<i>and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.</i>

10:04.354 --> 10:08.347
L.C. delivered the flooring.
If it rains, I'm afraid it's going to warp.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.436
Well, just put it in the garage.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.725
Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.855
Nice to meet you.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.693
Come take a look at the house.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.664
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris,
would you give me a hand...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.965
- How's it going?
- Good.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.466
- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.038
Good, huh?

11:14.591 --> 11:16.923
- It smells funny.
- You should have smelled it before.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.966
They had moldy newspapers everywhere,

11:19.053 --> 11:22.011
and dead pigeons all over the floor
and poop.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.218
- Lots of it.
- It's Jacoby's office.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.598
Mr. Jacoby.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.554
Oh, hey, Michelle. Sorry.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.396
I don't know. Hold on. I'll check.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.273
You got the photographs?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.085
I like to draw, too.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.424
You work here?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.219
No, Sally, I live here.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.094
I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.104
Of course you do.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.892
You see all the animal
paintings and friezes?

12:17.987 --> 12:21.150
They're by Emerson Blackwood,
a man who once lived here.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.240
He was a very famous wildlife painter.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.947
Hey, Sally, look.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.123
You want to try?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.626
What do you have there?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.955
- I found it.
- That's mine.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.794
It was my grandmother's.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.130
My mom gave me to my dad.

12:47.934 --> 12:48.969
Sally?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.180
You want to see your room?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.209
What do you think?

13:18.381 --> 13:21.839
Kim and I worked really hard
to get it ready. Check this out.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.554
It's pretty great, huh?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.058
It looks better at night.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.807
How long am I staying here?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.776
What did your mother tell you?

13:43.072 --> 13:47.031
She told me I was coming to visit.
But then she packed all my clothes.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.362
She didn't explain anything to you?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.161
- No.
- Sally.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.913
Your mother and I are worried about you.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.996
She thinks that maybe you're feeling sad

13:58.087 --> 14:02.080
and she thought that...
Well, we thought that perhaps a change

14:02.175 --> 14:05.963
might be good for you and that you could
come and live here with Kim and me

14:06.054 --> 14:08.636
until we finish the work on the house
and sell it.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.180
Then we could move
somewhere else and...

14:13.728 --> 14:15.514
Sally? Come on. Open the door.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.690
Come on. Let me in.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.522
Are you going to marry her?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.279
That's between Kim and me.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.616
Mom said you only liked her
because she was young.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.373
But she isn't. She's old.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.034
Sally.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.001
Open the door.

14:41.089 --> 14:45.503
Come on, sweetheart. Open the door.
Sally, please, let's talk about this.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.470
Look, I know...

14:55.645 --> 14:56.976
I know it must be tough.

14:57.063 --> 15:01.022
You've had a long flight,
and it's strange being in a new house.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.690
I want to go to bed now.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.144
Okay.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.696
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.757
You'd be a terrible poker player.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.848
You've been ironing that shirt
for half-an-hour.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.811
She sure didn't take to me.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.735
I wouldn't take it personally.
She's like that with everybody.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.064
Those pills she takes, what are they?

15:51.534 --> 15:52.694
Adderall, I think.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.529
Jesus.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.322
That's her mother for you.
That woman medicated our dogs.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.328
So, what about Jacoby?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.462
His assistant said he still
hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.883
- He's had them for a week.
- I know.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.302
We're still in the running,
and he's still coming to the dinner.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.129
- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.306
He gave it to the Spencer restoration
two years ago

16:17.393 --> 16:19.304
and you have done miracles here.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.687
We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.182
Thank you.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.813
These are new?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.103
- Yeah.
- Great.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.230
If we get the cover of
<i>Architectural Digest,</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:34.907
we won't need to take
out another bank loan, will we?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.704
You know what your
daughter told me today?

16:40.875 --> 16:41.864
What?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.826
She said your wife gave her to you.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.083
Kids say all kinds of
things they don't mean.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.922
It couldn't have gone any worse today.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.051
I feel like the evil stepmother.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.642
The evil and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.101
Because I was kind of thinking
you were looking a little ancient.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.606
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.444
The stuffed bear? What was I thinking?

17:13.616 --> 17:16.153
Come on. It's great. She likes it.
I saw it in her room.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.575
On her bed?

17:17.744 --> 17:20.703
Well, above the bed. Hanging by a noose.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.867
That's okay.
Nice sign of affection, I think.

18:15.886 --> 18:20.971
Sally. Her name is Sally.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.697
Sally!

20:34.233 --> 20:35.222
What do you think?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.316
Yeah. Looks great.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.483
- Have you seen Sally?
- Yeah, she's on the bench.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.111
Sally!

21:55.815 --> 21:58.397
It is not safe for you back here.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.817
Hey. What's going on? Everything okay?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.610
Keep her out from the back of the house.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.983
She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.861
I didn't do anything.

22:08.035 --> 22:11.698
There's pits. Old wells.
It's dangerous for a child.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.781
Mr. Harris is right, Sally. He knows.
His grandfather worked at the house.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.831
- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.375
There is no basement.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.377
Easy, Harris. I'll take her. It's okay.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.920
It's there! It's right there!

22:28.931 --> 22:32.469
There's a reason
this house is called Fallen Mill.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.176
The English had a mill here,
and it fell into a sinkhole.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.762
That's why most of the houses around here
don't have basements.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.017
This one does.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.100
- You may want to check this out.
- It's unsafe for a child.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.229
Pull on that.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.108
Look! I told you it was here!

22:47.199 --> 22:48.530
Can you believe this?

22:55.457 --> 22:57.038
This is definitely hollow.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.083
I'm going to get some tools.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.542
- You sure you want to do this now?
- Of course! You kidding?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.968
We can fix this easy if we have to.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.171
You may want to step back.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.476
Mr. Hurst, I...

23:35.331 --> 23:36.662
There's a door in here.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.788
Where did you put the old house keys?

23:42.880 --> 23:45.667
They're in your junk drawer in the office.

23:45.799 --> 23:46.834
Okay.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.174
Have a look.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.364
Oh, wow.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.204
- You be careful, Sally. Okay?
- Okay.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.581
How the hell did we miss this?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.634
That must be the garden window.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.313
It's all of his paints and old
color pencils. This is amazing.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.665
Wow. Alex, look at this.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.507
Harris, did you know about this?

25:16.598 --> 25:20.466
This place isn't safe. Especially for kids.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.051
It's okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.100
This must be where Blackwood worked.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.397
I found another door.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.730
- Look at these sketches.
- It's an ash pit, I think.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.854
Yeah. It's bolted shut.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.943
These are incredible.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.122
Okay. Let's go, Sally.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.635
Come on, Sally. Let's go.

25:57.973 --> 25:58.962
Sally, come on.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.137
This must be like King Tut's tomb for you.

26:03.312 --> 26:07.146
Which is why we shouldn't be touching
anything. This stuff must be valuable.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.558
- She's gone.
- No, she will come back.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.567
They always do.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.111
Yes, they always do.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.021
I don't think that's important, Alan.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.070
No, I just need to make sure I get
the paintings and furniture

26:57.157 --> 26:59.614
back in time for the dinner.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.199
You told me you could.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.494
Come on.
How long have we known each other?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.492
I'll write you a post-dated check.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.454
Hold on.

27:11.171 --> 27:15.961
It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.962
There you are.
I thought maybe we could bake scones.

27:21.723 --> 27:25.307
I promised Mrs. Underhill
we wouldn't make too much of a mess.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.725
No. That's all right.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.641
What have you got there?

27:32.192 --> 27:34.729
My doll. And my drawing stuff.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.535
Looks like it's just you and I
baking scones today.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.911
I made sandwiches for everyone.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.548
Sally, open the grate.

28:40.636 --> 28:44.128
Yes, open the grate. Set us free.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.643
Who are you?

28:52.940 --> 28:54.271
What do you look like?

28:54.691 --> 28:57.808
We've been locked up for so long.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.439
Set us free.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.947
Come down.
You'll see what it's like down here.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.618
Wait a minute, will ya?

29:08.747 --> 29:12.080
There's other children down here.
They're just like you.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.374
Come and play with them.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.494
Sally?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.165
Sally.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.961
What are you doing down here?

29:28.100 --> 29:31.092
- I heard something.
- Rats, probably. It's time for dinner.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.102
- It was a voice.
- Really smart rats, then.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.770
No! Listen.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.539
Nothing. Come on. Let's go, kiddo.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.806
- I forgot my bag.
- Hurry it up, then.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.053
Sally, now!

32:08.260 --> 32:10.751
We can get this tomorrow. We can't
get the rest of these for two weeks.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.461
What about the burnt umber?

32:12.639 --> 32:15.847
It's much warmer,
and we can get it for half the price.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.551
You not hungry? Sally?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.771
Don't you like rice?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.979
Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.528
Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says
gluten is bad for my concentration.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.651
Oh, come on. You love apple pie.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.358
We can worry
about your concentration tomorrow.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.194
Mommy says no gluten.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.199
What's your mother filling your head with?

32:39.291 --> 32:40.781
- How about some chocolate milk?
- No.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.286
- I'll make something else.
- Hold on.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.289
Sally, you need to eat this,
or you can go to your room. Okay?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.834
Good night, Dad.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.263
What?

32:58.059 --> 33:00.596
- Did that work on you when you were a kid?
- She's testing us, Kim.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.349
That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.184
Certainly not me.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.814
I didn't mean that.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.897
No. You're right. I'm not a parent.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.780
- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.

33:13.950 --> 33:17.113
I'm not sure
I'm ready to be anybody's mother.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.699
I had a hard enough time
getting over my own childhood

33:19.789 --> 33:21.575
to have to deal with somebody else's.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.327
Listen, will you help me with this, please?

33:23.418 --> 33:25.875
I realize this is terrible timing,
but I don't have a choice.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.668
I can't just send her back.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.545
That's not what I'm asking you to do.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.349
Apple pie.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.180
Thanks.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.363
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Alex. It's Joanne.</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:00.994
- Hi, Joanne.
- <i>Can I speak to Sally?</i>

34:01.164 --> 34:02.620
- No, you can't.
<i>- Why not?</i>

34:02.791 --> 34:05.453
Because she's asleep.
We're three hours ahead, remember?

34:05.544 --> 34:09.411
What were you thinking not telling her
she was going to be living here?

34:14.427 --> 34:18.215
You and I had a conversation.
I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.716
<i>Don't do this every time I have...</i>

34:19.808 --> 34:21.092
You're the one who wanted her here.

35:18.158 --> 35:21.070
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:31.868
Did you just speak to me?

35:32.047 --> 35:35.460
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

35:36.885 --> 35:38.500
<i>I love you.</i>

35:39.471 --> 35:40.802
<i>I love you.</i>

35:42.557 --> 35:43.922
<i>I love you.</i>

35:45.727 --> 35:47.058
<i>I love you.</i>

35:57.280 --> 35:59.396
The light, it hurts us.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.942
Yeah. Turn out the light.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.992
<i>I love you.</i>

36:07.415 --> 36:09.030
Turn out the light.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.250
We want to be friends.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.549
Where's my doll?

36:19.678 --> 36:23.045
With us. Sally's doll is with us.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.264
Who are you?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.470
We're your friends.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.021
Friends?

36:34.984 --> 36:35.973
Where?

36:36.277 --> 36:39.019
Come down to the basement
and play with us.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.445
Where are you?

36:57.090 --> 36:58.421
What are you?

37:07.851 --> 37:08.966
Hungry.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.633
Hungry.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.011
Very hungry.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.647
I have food.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.864
Let me see you.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.026
I won't hurt you, I promise.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.154
Sally?

37:33.001 --> 37:35.834
- What are you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.582
- Looking for what?
- I'm looking for my doll.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.504
How about Teddy instead?

37:47.682 --> 37:50.344
No. That's all right.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.310
- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.769
- I found it.
- You found it? Here in the house?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.651
Yeah.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.571
Can I call Mommy now?

38:05.742 --> 38:08.074
No, it's too late. She's probably asleep.

38:08.244 --> 38:11.907
I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.863
What about this light? Should I...

38:14.501 --> 38:15.832
Leave it on, please.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.326
All right, well, sleep well.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.923
Sally, would you do me a favor?

38:25.178 --> 38:27.294
Would you try to, maybe,
be friends with Kim?

38:29.933 --> 38:31.514
- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.583
Kim, have you seen my razor?

39:07.762 --> 39:09.218
We have to leave in five minutes.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.637
- Yeah. Have you seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.597
Five minutes.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.727
My dress.

39:50.555 --> 39:54.047
Sally. I want to talk to you downstairs
right now.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.637
I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.017
I didn't do it.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.815
- I didn't do anything. I swear.
- Stop lying.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.819
It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.363
You could have cut yourself.
What did you use, my razor?

40:10.825 --> 40:12.031
Let me see your hands.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.150
- It's mine.
- What is this?

40:14.245 --> 40:15.576
Where did you get this?

40:16.998 --> 40:18.408
- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.

40:18.499 --> 40:19.989
Just let me go home.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.917
I'm sorry about this.

40:23.087 --> 40:27.000
She's never done anything like this before.
She's obviously very angry about something.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.798
Alex, that is not anger. That is fear.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.797
We need to go. Mrs. Underhill,

40:31.888 --> 40:33.970
Kim and I have an appointment
at the historical society.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.718
We'll be back this afternoon.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.348
Sally, we're going out.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.431
Listen to Mrs. Underhill
and do what she says.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.183
And you think about
what you need to say to Kim, okay?

40:59.499 --> 41:02.991
Sally.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.716
Are you there?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.054
Did you cut Kim's clothes?

41:31.906 --> 41:33.771
Do you have my dad's razor?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.067
You have to tell me the truth.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.237
If you want to be friends.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.624
I won't be angry.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.329
Sally's not angry.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.918
They're angry.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.467
No, I'm not angry.

41:55.388 --> 42:00.098
They don't want to, but we do.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.727
Come down here, Sally.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.348
Come down and play.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.111
You said you were hungry.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.621
Do you like raisins?

42:30.256 --> 42:31.871
We said we liked them.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.046
See? Delicious.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.933
Delicious. Yeah.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.469
So delicious.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.223
Did you do something bad?

42:51.736 --> 42:54.102
You have to answer if
you want to be friends.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.278
Yes, friend.

42:56.574 --> 42:57.984
Sally?

42:59.535 --> 43:01.742
What are you doing
down here in the dark?

43:04.874 --> 43:06.990
Were you talking to someone?

43:09.337 --> 43:10.998
Is there someone here with you?

43:12.298 --> 43:14.960
No. I'm all alone.

43:15.885 --> 43:17.375
There's nobody here.

43:18.930 --> 43:24.266
Why don't you go help Mrs. Underhill
make lunch?

43:26.395 --> 43:27.851
Go on. Off you go now.

43:28.022 --> 43:31.105
That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!

44:29.959 --> 44:32.325
Harris. You old fool.

44:37.758 --> 44:41.376
I swear. I didn't tell them anything!

45:13.377 --> 45:14.366
No.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.458
No, please!

45:44.867 --> 45:46.198
Get away!

45:46.953 --> 45:50.411
I had an accident! Call for help!

46:20.444 --> 46:21.775
Don't look.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.821
I could hear screams down there.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.702
- Noises.
- Did you see anything?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.404
He asked me to leave the cellar.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.664
It was so dark in there,
he must have stumbled.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.616
- Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?

46:37.712 --> 46:39.543
- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.870
There's been an accident.

46:41.132 --> 46:45.000
- Are you okay? Where's Sally?
- I'm sorry. She saw him.

46:45.177 --> 46:47.213
I tried to cover her eyes,
and I was too late.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.966
- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.471
I am sorry!

46:53.060 --> 46:54.470
Sally?

47:13.414 --> 47:14.574
Hi.

47:17.668 --> 47:18.999
Are you scared?

47:22.423 --> 47:23.754
Do you want to talk about it?

47:26.844 --> 47:28.835
Is Mr. Harris going to die?

47:30.848 --> 47:32.008
No, Sally.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.845
He is going to be okay.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.651
Can I show you something?

48:23.067 --> 48:25.479
This is my favorite part of the house.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.234
Blackwood loved nature.

48:28.447 --> 48:32.031
He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.

48:33.661 --> 48:34.992
They're called koi.

48:36.247 --> 48:37.987
They're considered magical.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.950
Badgers can spot them
against the mud at the bottom

48:42.128 --> 48:43.538
because of their bright colors.

48:44.630 --> 48:50.591
So what makes them special
is also what makes them vulnerable.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.135
They have to be tough.

48:54.974 --> 48:56.464
And you, too, Sally.

49:01.147 --> 49:03.012
I didn't touch your clothes.

49:06.026 --> 49:08.267
I swear to God, I never touched them!

49:10.573 --> 49:12.780
- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.

49:12.867 --> 49:16.780
I didn't! Didn't cut them, I promise.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.112
I don't care about my clothes.

49:24.712 --> 49:27.124
I can't really tell. 1804, I think.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.627
It's hard to see.
The coin is pretty worn down.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.383
She probably found it
in Blackwood's studio.

49:38.225 --> 49:40.637
I don't want her
going down there anymore.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.720
I'm worried about her, Kim. It's not safe.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.031
- <i>This is Joanne.</i>
- Mommy?

49:56.202 --> 49:58.864
<i>Oh, sweetie, it's you! How are you?</i>

49:59.580 --> 50:00.990
Can I come home?

50:01.165 --> 50:04.157
<i>You want to come...</i>
<i>The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.</i>

50:04.251 --> 50:06.492
- I don't like it here.
<i>- You what?</i>

50:06.670 --> 50:11.505
<i>Honey, don't fret. It's so beautiful there.</i>
<i>You just need to get used to it.</i>

50:11.592 --> 50:13.173
But it's cold.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.585
<i>- Honey, what?</i>
- My bed is too big.

50:15.763 --> 50:17.845
<i>- Sweetheart.</i>
- And I think I'm getting sick.

50:17.932 --> 50:19.638
<i>You're not getting sick.</i>

50:19.725 --> 50:24.560
<i>It will take a little tiny bit of getting used to,</i>
<i>but you are going to be so happy there.</i>

50:24.647 --> 50:27.684
<i>Okay? I promise. You'll get used to it.</i>

50:29.068 --> 50:31.104
<i>I got to go, honey. Mommy's got to go.</i>

50:31.278 --> 50:33.769
<i>I'll see you soon. Bye!</i>

51:30.671 --> 51:31.660
Kim?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.464
- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?

51:45.019 --> 51:46.680
Even when I'm asleep.

51:50.024 --> 51:51.560
And don't turn off the lights.

51:54.528 --> 51:55.859
I'll be right here.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.355
Come on.

53:23.951 --> 53:24.986
Kim?

53:36.797 --> 53:39.163
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

54:37.316 --> 54:39.898
Daddy! Daddy!

54:40.736 --> 54:42.192
Daddy, please!

54:42.863 --> 54:43.852
Daddy!

54:45.491 --> 54:47.573
Sally, what's the matter?

54:54.374 --> 54:56.535
I don't want them to come anymore.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.616
Who, Sally?

54:58.504 --> 54:59.619
The little things.

55:01.006 --> 55:03.543
They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.

55:04.593 --> 55:09.428
They said they wanted to be my friend.
But they're horrible and mean.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.888
- You just had a nightmare.
- Don't say that!

55:15.562 --> 55:16.677
It's okay.

55:18.899 --> 55:20.059
My bear.

55:21.276 --> 55:23.107
Look what they did to my bear.

55:53.934 --> 55:58.394
Your dad tells me art is your
favorite subject. I wish I could draw.

55:59.314 --> 56:00.929
Drawing is easy.

56:02.609 --> 56:04.600
The other kids can't do feet and hands.

56:05.320 --> 56:09.359
When you say "the other kids,"
do you feel they're different from you?

56:09.449 --> 56:11.155
My doctor back home asked me that.

56:11.243 --> 56:12.949
What was your answer?

56:16.456 --> 56:20.290
Okay. Let's start with something easier.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.956
What's your favorite color?

56:24.798 --> 56:26.129
What is that? Purple?

56:26.800 --> 56:27.789
Black.

56:29.636 --> 56:33.595
How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?

56:40.731 --> 56:42.062
Fairies.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.015
Or gnomes.

56:45.193 --> 56:46.353
But scary ones?

56:49.615 --> 56:51.321
And you say they know your name?

56:57.164 --> 56:58.324
They talk to you?

56:59.708 --> 57:00.697
Yes.

57:04.504 --> 57:05.835
What do they say?

57:07.674 --> 57:09.164
They want to play with me.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.049
Is that all?

57:15.974 --> 57:18.010
They say my parents don't love me.

57:22.022 --> 57:23.558
Can I go now?

57:23.732 --> 57:25.563
<i>Just a few more questions, okay?</i>

57:44.044 --> 57:49.164
<i>There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl</i>
<i>and a deep belief that she's not wanted.</i>

57:49.299 --> 57:52.883
I believe that's what's triggering
these fantastic episodes.

57:53.095 --> 57:56.883
She told me she found a little tray filled
with teeth right inside that fireplace.

57:57.057 --> 58:00.424
Yeah. She found a tooth,
but that doesn't mean anything, does it?

58:00.727 --> 58:05.721
She's constructing this elaborate fantasy
about wrinkles, claws, fangs.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.398
She's individuated
each one of those things,

58:08.568 --> 58:10.399
her imaginary world, its inhabitants.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.320
It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.

58:14.282 --> 58:15.613
What do we do?

58:15.742 --> 58:18.028
I'd like to try her on a
stronger medication, for a start.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.327
I'll ask her doctor in LA to send me a copy
of her charts.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.370
You call my office,
make another appointment.

58:22.457 --> 58:23.446
Okay, great.

58:23.542 --> 58:25.749
Meanwhile, I'll give you something
to help her sleep.

58:33.010 --> 58:35.342
I'm going to be late. I can't believe it.

58:35.429 --> 58:38.296
If we don't get the extension on this loan,
we're not going to get the paintings

58:38.390 --> 58:40.255
or the furniture back on time.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.725
We forgot the invitations
for the historical society.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.179
Maybe we should just
postpone the dinner.

58:47.441 --> 58:50.729
Kim, it's <i>Architectural Digest.</i>
We have to get the house on the cover.

58:50.819 --> 58:51.899
- I know.
- If we don't,

58:51.987 --> 58:54.694
I'm never going to get my career back,
and we're not going to sell the place.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.193
- How often have we talked about this?
- What about what's been happening?

58:57.284 --> 58:58.524
Harris? That was an accident.

58:58.618 --> 59:01.701
- I'm talking about Sally.
- It's all in her head!

59:01.788 --> 59:04.700
It's real to her.
It doesn't matter if we see it.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.622
- Come on!
- Calm down!

59:08.336 --> 59:11.499
I'm going to walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.

59:35.363 --> 59:39.652
I'm not sure how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty heavily sedated.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.691
Mr. Harris, I know this is difficult,

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.694
but I need to understand something.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.323
I need to know what Sally saw
so that I can help her.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:26.862
Is she out of the house?

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:28.738
No.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.368
Out.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.372
She needs to be out of there.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:39.753
Why?

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.714
Why was that room sealed up?

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:51.515
Grandfather.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:54.723
Your grandfather closed it up?

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.562
- Yes.
- Why?

01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.728
After...

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.730
After...

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:07.660
After what?

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:10.913
Blackwood.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.871
What about Blackwood?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:22.259
Lot 1134.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.261
Public library.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:31.559
<i>Get her out of the house.</i>

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.466
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes.</i>

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:07.971
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:10.931
Excuse me.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:14.894
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for the librarian.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:18.811
Lot 1134.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.987
Emerson Blackwood, Special Collections.
One sec.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.244
Right this way.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.433
Can't remember the last time
anyone requested these. They're beautiful.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.977
I'm a designer.
I've been working at Fallen Mill.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:58.521
Wow. Now, that's a privilege.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:02.567
Personally, I think Emerson Blackwood
rivaled Audubon.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.361
Come across his mural?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.689
A mural? Where?

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:11.276
There in the house, supposedly.
If you do, I'd love to see it.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:47.854
Hello?

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:11.178
Now, it's pretty ironic, really.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:15.974
For a committed realist, someone who
insisted on drawing only from nature,

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.302
to do these at the end of his life.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:21.354
I've looked at everything by Blackwood,
and I've never seen any of these.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.183
You wouldn't.
The family made it a restricted donation.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.984
- These may never be published.
- Is it possible to get copies?

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.442
I'll see what I can do.

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:33.070
"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.659
Have you ever read Machen?

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.786
Arthur Machen. Welsh.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.955
He believed in fairy folk,

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:44.161
these ancient entities
from the netherworld, predating mankind.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:48.506
Blackwood quotes him extensively.
Here, that line. There.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.633
"One life must be taken."

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:54.171
These creatures had to take one human life
every time they emerged.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.505
to replenish their ranks.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.889
Many of these creatures fed on the bones,
the teeth of young children.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.308
And then there's a truce, a pact of sorts,

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.561
between Pope Sylvester II
and these ancient beings

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.483
in the year 999.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:12.985
In exchange for human teeth, they start
leaving silver pieces under the pillow.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.997
Now, this is the last known drawing
by Emerson Blackwood,

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.667
made shortly before his disappearance
and the loss of his child.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.590
His child?

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.922
Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:37.722
Not long after, Blackwood himself
disappeared without a trace.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.197
No!

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:40.447
No! No! Please!

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.005
No!

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.102
Sally, what's wrong?

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.904
Sally, open the door!

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.457
Oh, my God!

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.598
Dear, thank goodness you're home.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:46.134
- Where is she?
- I put her to bed.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.052
She wouldn't stop screaming.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:00.986
Sally?

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.491
Kim!

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.660
She's not down here.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:49.404
I think she's run away.
She's done it before.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:55.749
Once she tried to walk all the way back
to LA from our family home in Boston.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.082
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's what she's doing.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.886
I went and visited Harris today.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:14.893
Blackwood had a son. Did you know that?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.225
And when he was eight, he disappeared.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.185
And Blackwood vanished a few days later.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.020
Why are you telling me this?

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.197
A lot of what Blackwood wrote
at the end of his life,

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:27.277
it's awfully close to Sally's story,
gnomes, creatures, all of it.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:28.782
Kim, don't tell me you believe this.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.988
Something terrible happened
in that basement.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.328
- We need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.330
Put a million miles
between us and that house.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:39.005
Every cent I have is in that house.
And you're saying that we just walk away?

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:42.175
I accept that
my daughter has problems, okay?

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.126
Thank you. We all know that.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.508
But they do not involve
monsters in the basement.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:48.973
There she is.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.449
Come on, Sally. Get in the car.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:14.282
Sally, please, just tonight,
and after the party we'll talk, okay?

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:44.321
Four, three, two and one.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:46.981
There.

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.823
After the party, I will get you out of here.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.659
No matter what. I promise.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.167
- Sally!
- No.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.626
I took it from them.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.376
- You can't have this.
- They stole it. You don't understand.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.712
- I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:09.841
Please!

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.221
Nobody believes me.

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.930
Sally, I trust you,

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:23.064
and you can tell me anything at all.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.233
They don't like bright lights.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:33.823
Those things.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.529
They don't?

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.919
Then I have a good idea.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.635
Mr. Jacoby, I am so
glad you could make it.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.587
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.172
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:54.803
It's a pleasure. Come on in.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:58.515
The house looks absolutely fantastic.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.020
You've done a remarkable job.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.398
Well, thank you.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.605
- We'd love the nickel tour.
- Of course. That's the whole point.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.190
The foyer, obviously.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.697
The mahogany, we shipped from
the very same vendor

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:13.572
that Blackwood used in London.
It's been in business since 1865.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.496
You know Bill from the heritage board.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.453
Easy, Sally. Not everybody
wants to have their photograph taken.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.092
So, Alex, where's Kim?

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:39.602
I think she's still upstairs.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:43.682
Why don't you step into the library,
grab a drink, and I'll join you in a moment.

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:11.884
Kim, hey, what's going on?

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.387
Her drawings.
They're exactly Blackwood's sketches.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.800
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw
your photographs and copied them.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.476
No, she didn't.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.645
Kim, please, Jacoby's here.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.978
- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:28.143
This is serious!

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.778
Just because you keep denying it
does not mean

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.480
- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.282
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
When should we serve dinner?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.907
Ten minutes, please. Kim, everybody
is waiting. Will you come downstairs?

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:41.239
- We can talk about this later.
- No.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.345
- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.842
- Please!
- Not now. Come on!

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.095
Welcome, everybody.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.894
Please, have a seat.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.563
If I could just say a few words
to all of you friends of Fallen Mill,

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:15.740
both big and small.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:19.444
Thank you for joining us this evening.
It means a great deal to us.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:24.995
Every aspect of this restoration
has followed the exact specifications

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:28.249
and materials used
in the original construction of the house,

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:32.256
including the wood assembling techniques,
the layout in the kitchen,

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.587
even the lacquering process
for all the timber.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:38.175
It's something Kim and I are very proud of,
and I'm sure all of you,

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:43.343
with your vast array of expertise,
will appreciate the attention to detail.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:47.062
The art you see on the walls, the friezes,

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.186
even the furniture that you're sitting on,

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:54.274
has all been meticulously chosen,
reassembled or restored,

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.401
depending on its condition,

01:14:56.575 --> 01:15:00.693
to, I think, truly represent the essence
of the Blackwood collection.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.736
So, thank you to the heritage board

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.157
for their assistance,
and to the historical society,

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.629
and, of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:17.840
Your interest in our projects is nothing
short of inspirational. So, thank you.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.176
And finally, to the house itself.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.342
May its newly restored life be long
and happy.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.776
I guess not everybody is a fan
of tonight's menu.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.426
Poor Sally. No one believes you.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.633
What do you want?

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.465
Please just tell me what you want!

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:25.888
We want you!

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:32.770
Daddy! Daddy, please!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:37.774
Daddy!

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.521
Sally?

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:43.860
- Daddy!
- Sally?

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.825
Daddy, they're in here!

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.083
Open the door!

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.176
- Charles.
- What's going on in there?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.314
No! Get off of me! Stop it!

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:55.719
Sally!

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:02.188
Sally. Sally.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:04.565
Look at me. Sally, look at me. Look at me.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:08.199
Picture, I took a picture.

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:20.999
- I think we better call it a night.
- I think we should.

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.096
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.786
Alex, can I talk to you?

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.506
I feel like I have no idea what to do.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.310
I love my daughter, Kim,

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.736
and I love you.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.653
I love you, too.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.070
We should go, right?

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.915
- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.102
- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.098
Kim?

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.010
Hi.

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:45.514
Where are we going?

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:50.611
We're going to go to a hotel downtown.
We're going to get you out of here.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.137
Alex?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:40.928
Alex?

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:46.642
Alex?

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.288
It's okay, it's okay.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.565
A life will be taken.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.317
One life must be taken.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:46.195
A life will be taken.

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:48.113
One life must be taken.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:56.663
Sally.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.341
Sally!

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.341
Child's teeth!

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:08.599
Kim?

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:20.854
Kim?

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:26.697
Kim?

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:29.200
Daddy?

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:46.888
Kim?

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:56.647
Kim?

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:31.515
Kim!

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.052
Kim! Please.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.014
Kim.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:39.857
Wake up, please!

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.028
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:46.364
- Wake up, Kim.
- Wake up, Kim.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:47.907
Wake up, Kim.

01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:13.888
The key. The key.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.086
Kim, please!

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:43.917
Daddy! No!

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.505
Kim!

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:05.686
Kim, please!

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.135
Sally?

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.568
Sally? Sally!

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.567
Kim!

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:02.159
Let go of me!

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.661
Don't make me go in there!

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.331
Kim! Please!

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:21.928
Kim?

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:26.474
Kim?

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.526
- Please, Kim!
- I'm here, Sally!

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:36.284
No, please!

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.620
Sally!

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:54.627
Kim?

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:57.972
No! Go away!

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:03.812
Hold on! Hold on! I got you.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:07.395
Keep them away, Sally. Use the light.
Use the light.

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:08.892
Kim!

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:11.979
Get him.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.243
No! Please!

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.909
- Get away from me!
- Get off of me!

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.300
When I cut this rope, Sally, you run!

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:39.510
Please!

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:41.015
You run! You got that?

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:42.847
No, what about you?

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.471
- No! Please!
- Be strong.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:07.367
Kim!

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:10.871
No!

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:30.556
Sally?

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:34.060
Sally?

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.858
Sally, are you okay? Sally.

01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:41.526
Alex?

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:48.658
Kim!

01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:53.454
Kim!

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.341
Kim!

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.267
Dad?

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:09.679
Daddy?

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:15.768
Daddy.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.563
Please!

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:08.139
That's far enough, Sally.

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:21.228
I love you, Kim.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:28.887
They will find us. They will find us
and hurt us. We must fight.

01:35:28.973 --> 01:35:34.718
No, we will go deeper, and we will wait.

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.559
They will forget, and others will come.

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:41.273
When will they come?
When will we get them?

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:44.151
Soon, soon.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.653
- We have all the time in the world.
- Yes.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:54.655
All the time in the world.
