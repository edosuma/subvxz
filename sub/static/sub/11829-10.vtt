00:33.900 --> 00:36.100
With all the airport security,
she got on the wrong flight?

00:36.900 --> 00:40.300
She was in the first-class lounge, so she
picked up someone else's boarding pass.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.700
She was supposed to go to New York,
the pass said Chicago,

00:42.700 --> 00:44.000
so that's where she went.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.000
She needs to get to New York
so she can go to London with her group.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.400
I'm gonna go make sure she makes
her connection.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.700
What if she's in London,

00:50.700 --> 00:53.800
misses her connection and ends up
in Timbuktu?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.100
Then you can go pick her up.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.100
I made a lasagna.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.400
Put it in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.600
Make sure you sprinkle a little parmesan
on top before you heat it up.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.700
Or after I heat it up.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.400
It'll be hot and melt in,
but not too much.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.200
Or it won't melt at all, which is
why you put it on before you heat it up.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.800
What's wrong with unmelted cheese?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.100
I went to the store,
bought the ingredients,

01:13.100 --> 01:16.000
cooked the noodles, made the sauce
it's not from a jar.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Don't ruin it all by throwing cold cheese
on top.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.100
George, you can't feed her fast food
at every meal.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.400
She's having a baby.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.900
I know that.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.100
Make sure Amy gets to her new school.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
I've never missed a first day of school.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.900
I hate leaving her like this.

01:31.900 --> 01:32.800
With me?

01:33.000 --> 01:33.900
Yes.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
Goodbye.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.600
I'll call you.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Don't bother.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.200
Amy!

01:45.400 --> 01:46.700
Ashley!

01:52.500 --> 01:54.300
You really wanna go to school
with a bunch of sluts?

01:54.300 --> 01:56.500
Dad, if you're calling them sluts,
you're calling me a slut.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.600
No, I'm not. Where'd you get that?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.700
Technically, you were a slut
for 2 1/2 minutes...

02:00.900 --> 02:01.700
or less.

02:01.700 --> 02:02.300
Hey,

02:02.300 --> 02:04.300
you might get away with those remarks
when your mother's around,

02:04.300 --> 02:06.400
but you can't get away with that stuff
when I'm in charge, you got it?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.500
Tell him I got it,
but he said "sluts" first.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.199
Go get in the car.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.500
Tell him school's not open.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.700
It's only 6:30.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.200
Haven't had breakfast.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.400
There's a bar of soap in the sink.
Have that for breakfast.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.200
Tell Ward Cleaver I'm on a hunger strike
until Mom gets back.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.100
Let's go back to your old school.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.800
No, let's not.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.400
Henry.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.700
What day is it?

03:13.700 --> 03:14.600
It's Monday.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.100
We gotta get ready for school.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.700
Come on, Henry. You can do it.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.900
Today is the first day of the rest
of your life.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.100
It's a new beginning.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.600
It's the end of an era.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.500
Maybe Alice will change her mind.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.400
Yeah, maybe.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.900
Once I tell her about Ashley.

03:32.000 --> 03:32.900
What?

03:32.900 --> 03:34.100
There's nothing to tell.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.300
You stared at her all night.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.100
You gonna tell Alice you stared at a girl
from junior high all night?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.700
Because that's all there is to tell.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.700
I'll make it sound better than that.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.500
It was better than that.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
Which is it?

03:45.500 --> 03:48.800
Are you smitten with Ashley,
or are you pining for Alice?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.700
I don't know. I'm conflicted.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.100
Ashley's pretty,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.200
but Ashley isn't Alice.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.600
And Alice is Alice,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.900
but Alice isn't Ashley.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.200
I think I ate too many preservatives.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.400
Affirmative.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.900
Sort this out for yourself before you
say anything to either one of them.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.800
Well,

04:07.800 --> 04:09.400
Alice should know about Ashley.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.000
Ashley knows about Alice.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.100
It's only fair.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.100
Don't be an idiot.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.200
Don't say anything.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.200
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.700
Just take me to the new school
because I'm not going back to my old one.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.700
But it's the best thing you can do
for yourself.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.500
Dad, how is going to my old school
the best thing I could do for myself?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.900
It's a magnet school.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.100
It's got a great band and orchestra,

04:28.100 --> 04:29.900
which is why you wanted to go there
in the first place,

04:29.900 --> 04:32.100
and that's where Ben is and your two
best friends.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.300
And it's a five-minute car ride.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.800
The other school's way across town.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.700
Way acro town in a better neighborhood,

04:36.700 --> 04:39.400
a better building with better teachers
and fewer students.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.300
Are you worried about gas prices
or something?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.800
What? No.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.700
If something happened to you,

04:43.700 --> 04:45.900
I'd wanna be able to get to you as soon
as possible.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.900
That school always has a doctor on call.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.800
I'll get you a doctor if anything happens,
but think about it.

04:51.000 --> 04:51.900
In an emergency,

04:51.900 --> 04:54.200
don't you want your best friends
and family to care for you?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.700
Dad, I haven't heard from my two
best friends all weekend.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.400
Not a phone call or a text from Madison
or Lauren.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.200
You wanna know why they're not talking
to me?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.600
It's because I'm having a baby,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.300
and they want nothing to do with me.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.800
Neither does anyone else.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.100
That's not true, sweetie.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.000
Come on, listen to me.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.900
I love you, Amy,

05:11.100 --> 05:13.300
and I would never tell you to do this

05:13.300 --> 05:15.500
if I didn't think it was the right thing
to do.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.200
You making two sandwiches?
One of those for me?

05:23.200 --> 05:24.200
No.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.200
I thought maybe I'd invite Jack
to have lunch with me today.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.900
I think it's time we should talk.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.500
Adrian thinks we should get back together.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.400
I don't the person to go to
for relationship advice.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.800
She was with Jack, wasn't she?

05:35.800 --> 05:36.500
Was she?

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
Wasn't she?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
Forgive and forget.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.100
I've forgotten already.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.700
If it were that simple.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.500
It is.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.400
No, it's not.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.100
You might be able to forgive and forget,
but it still happened.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.900
I know,

05:49.300 --> 05:52.400
but I haven't found any guys I'd even
wanna go out with...

05:53.400 --> 05:56.400
besides Ricky, and he's with Adrian.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.000
Your new friend Adrian.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.800
Besides, I just miss Jack.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
you know Tom is very good,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.200
very resourceful at making friends.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.400
Maybe he can help you out.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.600
All right, fine.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.800
but I'm gonna have another conversation
with Jack

06:10.800 --> 06:12.600
if you two ever decide to go out again.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.900
Dad, face it

06:13.900 --> 06:15.900
you don't tnk any guy is good enough
for me.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.000
Did Adrian tell you that?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.100
No, but it's still true.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
So,

06:20.500 --> 06:21.700
what's Jack been up to?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.300
Does he have any other new friends
like Adrian?

06:24.300 --> 06:24.900
No.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.500
I'm sure he's been busy focusing on his
schoolwork until I decide what I want.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.200
That's right,

06:30.400 --> 06:32.100
that's exactly what football players do

06:32.100 --> 06:34.600
when they break up any relationship
they concentrate on academics.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.400
Some of 'em even become astronauts.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.400
Sweetheart,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.300
Jack hasn't even had time to call you.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.200
He doesn't wanna call me because
he doesn't wanna keep getting rejected.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.800
Besides, I've been ignoring him.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.400
So you're gonna offer yourself up to him
over a sandwich.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.400
es that sound like the beginning
of a good relationship to you?

06:52.600 --> 06:53.900
Mom cooks for you every night.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.300
I'm sleeping with your mother.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.100
What's your point?

06:57.100 --> 06:58.400
That is my point.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.000
Dad, it's just food.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.900
It's not just food, ever.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.100
I told you you'd have fun if you slept
over.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.300
I can't do this all the time.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.100
My foster dad will be back today.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.300
Well, then they need to leave the country
more often.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.500
Why can't you tell your foster parents
where you are?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.100
i mean They know you're my boyfriend.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.500
Yeah, and they also know I'm having a baby
with Amy.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.400
Oh, yeah,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.200
I forgot for two seconds.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.700
Thanks for reminding me.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.200
She starting that new school today?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.700
Yeah, she's supposed to.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.100
How often do you talk to her?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.500
Whenever I want.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And Ben doesn't mind that?

07:40.900 --> 07:42.800
I don't know. I don't talk to Ben.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.600
I don't know why you talk to Amy.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.900
'Cause she's having my baby.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.300
Would you stop saying that?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.000
She's not having your baby.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.900
She's having a baby.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.300
You're not gonna try to go to birthing
classes or anything, are you?

07:56.300 --> 07:57.100
I might.

07:57.100 --> 07:57.800
You might?

07:57.800 --> 07:59.100
If she wants me there.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.100
She's not gonna want you there,

08:01.100 --> 08:03.200
'cause that's when she's gonna hate you the most.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.300
Why should she hate me if I'm trying
to help her?

08:05.600 --> 08:06.900
I'm the good guy here.

08:06.900 --> 08:07.900
Good guy?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.500
- Good guy.
- Yeah, good guy.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.900
I'm sorry I slept over.
I knew this would happen.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.900
Oh, you knew what would happen?

08:16.900 --> 08:20.900
You knew we'd have great sex all night
and then argue over your daddy issues?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.400
Oh, I have daddy issues and you don't?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.300
This is why I wanna be involved
with my son or daughter.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.500
Why?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.300
So they won't grow up like you.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.900
Oh, I can't believe this.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.600
Come on. No. Stop. Ricky.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.500
No, get off.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.200
Let me answer...

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
Ricky, stop.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.700
I have to get the door.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Stop.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.100
Who is it?

08:49.700 --> 08:50.600
It's your father.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.800
Don't open it.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.500
Adrian, is that you?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.600
Are you OK?

08:57.700 --> 08:58.600
Daddy?

09:12.600 --> 09:16.000
???

09:16.000 --> 09:17.500
??

09:17.500 --> 09:18.300
???

09:18.300 --> 09:20.100
??

09:20.100 --> 09:23.400
???

09:24.400 --> 09:26.100
I don't speak Spanish, just so you know.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.600
We're trying to have a private
conversation here, OK?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.500
- I'm happy to leave.
- No.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.200
I have to get to school.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.900
Why, so you could see Amy?

09:33.900 --> 09:35.600
Amy? Who's Amy?

09:36.900 --> 09:37.900
You have a girlfriend?

09:37.900 --> 09:40.000
She's not my girlfriend. She's just...

09:40.300 --> 09:41.200
having my baby.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.600
A baby.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.000
You can go.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.800
I said no.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.800
Let him go.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.500
I wanna talk to you.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.100
And a lot of what I wanna talk
about is him.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.600
This is my house.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.800
You can't just come in here
and tell me what to do.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.900
You wanted a father.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.600
I'm your father.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.500
And I say he goes.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.600
Now.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.500
Goodbye.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.800
Nice to meet you.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.300
How do you know this guy's not gonna
beat me up?

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
She's my daughter.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.100
We'll be fine here without you.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.400
That's the best you can do.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.300
You're the best my mother could do.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.900
I offered to marry her.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.500
She didn't wanna get married.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.000
She wanted to be on her own.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.600
She didn't want me anywhere near you.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.800
She didn't even call me
when you were born.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.700
I wanted to be there.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.600
She told me I could meet you
when you turned 18

10:39.600 --> 10:41.400
and you could decide for yourself.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.600
I'm not 18.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
I know that.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.200
And you're too young to decide
what's best for you,

10:46.200 --> 10:48.400
so your mother and I have decided.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.600
What?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.000
I have a wife,

10:51.600 --> 10:53.500
and you have two brothers,

10:53.500 --> 10:56.300
and they're prepared to welcome you
with open arms.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.600
You're insane.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.900
I'm not going anywhere.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.600
Yes, you are.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.000
Or if you like, I can get a court order.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
What are you, a cop?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.100
Something like that.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.600
I'm an assistant D.A.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.200
You prosecute cases for the District
Attorney?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.500
In what county?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.100
- This one.
- Really?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.700
You still can't make me go home
with you without my consent

11:15.900 --> 11:17.700
or my mother's consent.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.700
I said I have your mother's consent.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.300
And you know what?

11:21.900 --> 11:23.400
She's absolutely right.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.600
You don't listen.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.200
You hear what you wanna hear,
and you do what you wanna do.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.600
But not anymore.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.200
I have to get ready for school.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.700
You should go.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.600
Fine.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.300
But I'll be back.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
Yeah, Ricky and I have a connection.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.500
Can't fight it.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.800
And it's not just about sex.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.100
He respects me.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.300
Oh, right.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.500
So, not like Amy, 'cause he didn't respect
her at all.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.500
OK, you're being insane.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.400
Snap out of it.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.800
You don't have a connection with this guy.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.200
He's just a man whore.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.800
That is so immature.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.700
Making out with the guy who got your
best friend pregnant isn't immature?

12:19.700 --> 12:21.700
He said that Amy was the one
who wanted to do it.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.500
She said she didn't know
what was happening.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.600
Who doesn't know they're having sex?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.000
I knew I was making out with him.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.200
You don't think you did anything wrong.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.800
No, I don't. ???

12:30.900 --> 12:34.200
Then why don't you tell Amy since
you don't think you did anything wrong?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.400
Why would I tell her I made out with him?

12:36.400 --> 12:38.500
She didn't tell us when she had sex
with him,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.100
so why would I tell her if me out
with him?

12:40.100 --> 12:42.100
It was just making out.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.800
Oh, no, you're not gonna tell her.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.500
No, I'm not gonna tell her,

12:49.200 --> 12:50.500
but you should.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.800
You're afraid to tell her, aren't you?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.600
Maybe.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.600
I'd be afraid to tell her I made out
with the father of her baby.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.900
I'm afraid to tell her you made out
with the father of her baby.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.800
So I'm not gonna tell her.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.800
If you're not gonna tell her,
why should I tell her?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.600
'Cause we're all best friends.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.800
Yeah, well, maybe we're not all
best friends anymore.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.500
Maybe you and I are best firends with Amy.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.600
Maybe just you a I are best friends
with each other now.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.200
Here, you left your book in the car.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.000
Thanks.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.400
Let's get something straight -

13:21.400 --> 13:23.800
the two of you were never best friends
with Amy.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.900
That's why you told everyone she's having
Ricky's baby,

13:25.900 --> 13:28.200
and that's why she's off to slut school
this morning.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.200
Excuse my language.
That's whaat'seryone calls it.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.900
I think that's terrible.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.400
And I think it's terrible Amy's not going
to school here.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.700
We should be supporting her.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.700
Good morning.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Morning. Hello.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.400
Forget about Ashley, OK?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.900
You are Henry of Henry and Alice.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.300
Alice will be back.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.900
Oh, let's bet on it.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.700
Maybe I don't want her back.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.600
I don't know.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.400
I told you, I'm conflicted.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.100
Dan Marino is a legend,
but he's no Tom Brady.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.300
Dan Marino doesn't need championship
rings to be a hero.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.300
It's more than winning, Alice.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.000
He made the most of his situation.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.600
He tried to pull his team up.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.000
He didn't desert everybody to win some
big championship ring.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.300
That's loyalty.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.200
So you do pick Marino over Brady?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.600
You're very earnest.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.900
Earnest, adjective - marked by our showing
deep sincerity or seriousness.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.000
Thank you.

14:41.200 --> 14:41.800
Hey.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.800
Hi, Amy.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.400
I'm so glad you changed your mind, OK?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.100
This is the right thing to do.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.700
It is.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.900
I love you.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.600
I'll be here for you.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.400
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.700
She can't just...

15:31.100 --> 15:32.400
give me away.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.000
I wouldn't think so, no.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.400
- But you wanted a father.
- No, I didn't say that.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.100
I said I wanted to meet my father.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.100
i mean What do I need him for now?
I'm all grown up.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.300
says he had an agreement with your mother,
right?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.700
He wasn't around. Now he's around.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.200
Don't turn this into a bad thing.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.800
He wants me to go live with him
and his lousy family.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.100
So go meet them.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.000
Maybe you'll like them.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.700
What? What is it?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.100
I can't believe my mother would do this
without discussing it with me.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.000
This is why you need to talk to her.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.800
You have to talk to her.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.200
Come on, let's call her, you and me.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.400
This is your fault.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.900
You're the one who told me who he is.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.100
You're the one who stole my permanent
records.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.200
Hi.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Hi.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.600
Don't suppose you're here for the condoms.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.500
No.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.300
The D.A.'s office is calling.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.600
They want her file.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.600
Hi, Adrian.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.700
Hi.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.700
you are here.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.800
Hi.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.500
Hi.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.100
???

16:44.500 --> 16:45.900
Nothing. Um,

16:46.200 --> 16:47.600
don't you wanna sit with Ben?

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
Oh, well,

16:48.600 --> 16:51.500
he said he'd wait for me after class,
but I don't know where he is.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.200
Maybe he could sit with the three of us?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.600
???

16:58.600 --> 17:00.900
We're just really happy you're back.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.200
We're so happy.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.800
I gotta go.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.300
I can't stand that guy.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.400
What are you doing here?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.000
- Thought you were at...
- Slut school?

17:17.300 --> 17:18.500
I changed my mind.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.400
hey, you're noa slut.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.400
Do you ???

17:21.400 --> 17:23.099
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.500
Wait somewhere else.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.300
It's OK, Madison.
I probably need to talk to him.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.100
OK, fine. If you see Jason,
tell him I'm with Lauren.

17:31.100 --> 17:31.700
Ok.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.400
So how's your day going?

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
Not that well.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.300
Mine, either.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.600
Yeah, well, maybe you should
go to slut school.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.500
You'd probably like it there.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.300
Lots of young, naive girls.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.700
They're already pregnant.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.400
Come on, Amy, don't do this to yourself
or to me.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.600
Ricky,??? either.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.000
There's really no good place for me to go.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.000
At least Ben is here, you know?

18:03.800 --> 18:04.700
Somewhere.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.500
i told you,

18:05.500 --> 18:07.800
it's alternative extensioexhons
fohoindependendewomen.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.300
???

18:09.500 --> 18:10.600
It's slut school.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.500
Say it.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.800
Alternative...

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
...extension school for independent women.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
???

18:23.900 --> 18:26.000
??

18:26.000 --> 18:26.700
Just say it.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
She should be at slut school.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.100
I'm sorry, A..

18:31.800 --> 18:33.300
I didn't misto happen.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.700
Ricky, I believe you.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.500
I believe you didn't mean for this
to happen.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.400
I believe this is the last thing in the
world you wanted to happen,

18:41.700 --> 18:44.300
so why don't you pretend like
it never happened?

18:44.300 --> 18:45.400
Because I can't.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.600
I wish I could, but I can't.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.100
It's just not who am anymore.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.600
I'm a different person from the Ricky
who got you pregnant.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.800
That's the thing, Amy - you have to take
the bad things that happen to you in life

18:54.800 --> 18:57.100
and use them to turn your life around.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.300
That's what builds character, you know.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.600
You better go over there
and tell her before he does.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.400
I don't trust either of us to know
what the right thing to do is anymore.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.600
I'm gonna call my dad.

19:14.000 --> 19:14.600
Lauren?

19:14.900 --> 19:15.700
Something wrong?

19:15.700 --> 19:17.000
Dad,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I did something stupid,
and now I don't know what to do.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
Well,

19:21.100 --> 19:23.400
we all do stupid things from time to time.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
What did you do, sweetie?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.000
You know Amy, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.500
Yes, I know Amy.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.800
Please tell me you're not in the same
situation before I have a heart attack.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.100
No, I didn't do that, but...

19:33.300 --> 19:34.000
But what?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.700
I did make out with a guy.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.700
Oh.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
Why are you so upset about this make-out
session?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.100
Oh, by the way,

19:43.100 --> 19:47.200
thank you for calling me and trusting me
with whatever it is.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.000
I made out with the guy that
got Amy pregnant.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.300
you know, Ricky?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.500
And now I may have -

19:54.200 --> 19:55.700
I think we got disconnected.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.000
And I think I may have lost a best friend.

20:13.000 --> 20:13.900
Here you go.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.300
Hello?

20:20.000 --> 20:20.900
Amy.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.800
Mom?

20:21.800 --> 20:22.700
Hi, honey.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.200
how are you?

20:24.200 --> 20:25.500
???

20:25.500 --> 20:27.100
Can you talk? Are you OK?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.400
Yeah, I'm OK.

20:28.700 --> 20:29.800
What class are you in now?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.700
Uh, lunch class.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.000
But I-I have to go.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.500
Oh, OK. No problem.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.000
Um,

20:38.900 --> 20:39.800
I love you.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.100
- What?
- Did you take Amy to her new school?

20:53.100 --> 20:55.200
Did you ask me to take Amy
to her new school?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.800
Don't tell me you talked her out of it.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.300
I didn't. ???

21:00.500 --> 21:02.000
Bad connection.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.200
You're on a landline.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.700
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.000
Ben?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.200
??? you OK?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.200
Don't tell Amy.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.100
Hi! Somebody help!

21:30.200 --> 21:31.000
You know,

21:31.200 --> 21:32.300
maybe it's not a good idea

21:32.300 --> 21:35.500
for you and your wife to send your
daughter back to this school right now.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.900
My daughter can go to this school
if my daughter wants to go to this school.

21:39.900 --> 21:43.300
You think it's a good idea
for Amy to be flaunting her mistake?

21:43.300 --> 21:44.500
Watch it, Kathleen.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.200
I'm not judging her, I'm judging you.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.800
It's your job to look out
for your daughter,

21:47.800 --> 21:49.500
and if you had been today,

21:49.500 --> 21:52.300
my daughter wouldn't be in the principal's
office for being a good Samaritan.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.700
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.700
I forgot what it was like to be married
to you.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.700
Speaking of which,

21:57.700 --> 21:58.700
how's Anne?

21:59.500 --> 22:01.100
I heard you were living at
the furniture store.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.000
You heard wrong.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm at home with my wife and daughters.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.099
- Not that it's any yaneswax.
- Blah, blah, blah.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.900
I forgot what it's like to be married
to you.

22:07.900 --> 22:08.900
Oh, that's nice.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.900
I see you really have found Jesus,

22:10.900 --> 22:13.300
you and your Christian doctor-husband.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.600
It really gets to you, doesn't it,
that he's a doctor?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, it does,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.700
but then I remember he has to sleep
with you, and I'm OK.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.500
Hi. Where's the counselor's office?

22:23.500 --> 22:26.400
My daughter Adrian's there now.
Marc Molina ed me.

22:26.700 --> 22:28.400
- He's down the hall.
- Thank you.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.100
Do... you two know each other?

22:35.500 --> 22:37.000
No, we don't.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.100
Yes, you do.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.000
No, we don't.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.600
Yes, we do.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.400
- I knew it.
- ???

22:43.400 --> 22:44.800
???

22:46.800 --> 22:48.100
you're back home.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.000
See? ???

22:50.500 --> 22:51.400
Are you Anne?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
No...

22:52.700 --> 22:53.600
thank God.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.600
Did you ?? Tdrian's mom?

22:56.700 --> 22:58.400
Yes. Why? Is there a problem?

22:58.400 --> 22:59.500
Is there a problem with that?

22:59.500 --> 23:02.000
No, not at all. Adrian is Grace's friend.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm Kathleen Bowman, Dr. Bowman's wife.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.000
George is my ex. Nice to meet you.

23:08.700 --> 23:09.500
Your ex?

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
Yes, my ex.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.700
Oh,

23:13.700 --> 23:15.500
so you've been married before.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.300
You never told me.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.400
So I guess you've cheated before.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.500
You've ruined a marriage before.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.600
Ach. God, I should've known.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
It's nice to meet you, Kathleen.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
George...

23:31.400 --> 23:32.700
you never tell anyone, do you?

23:32.700 --> 23:33.900
Tell anyone what?

23:33.900 --> 23:35.800
That I was the one who cheated on you.

23:38.100 --> 23:38.900
Yeah, right.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.800
Like you would ever danything like that.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Grace.

23:43.900 --> 23:44.900
Hi, honey.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.800
Hi.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.100
Nice guys, those police officers.

23:48.100 --> 23:52.100
They're trying to figure out who hit Ben,
and I don't know, but Ben's fine.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.000
That's all that matters.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.500
Hello.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.400
OK, well, we should get going home.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.800
I think I'd actually rather go back
to class.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.400
Ok.

24:08.700 --> 24:09.600
Bye, George.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.300
I bet you know a lot, don't you?

24:20.100 --> 24:21.300
I know nothing.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.600
Where's Amy?
She said she wanted to go home.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.600
she still Talking to the band director.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.600
Do you think Amy should stay in school
here?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.600
I think you and your wife should discuss
that...

24:31.300 --> 24:33.000
since you're back home and all.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.100
- Dr. Fields. Hi.
- Hi.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.100
Is Lauren OK?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.000
I wanna see Ricky Underwood right now.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.800
Yes, sir.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.700
I'll pull him from class.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.200
He's right across the hall.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.100
Thank you.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.200
- George Juergens, Amy Juergens' dad.
- Hi.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.800
So how do you know scumbag
Ricky Underwood?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.400
Your daughter's not pregnant, too, is she?

24:54.400 --> 24:55.100
No.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.100
My daughter's Lauren, Amy's best friend.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.300
I'm Lauren's dad.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.100
No, you're not. I've met him.
You're not Lauren's dad.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.200
What's going on here?

25:02.200 --> 25:03.700
I am her dad.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.400
She lives with her mother and stepfather.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.200
Oh.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.500
So what's the big emergency
with Ricky Underwood?

25:08.500 --> 25:10.100
You sure Lauren's not pregnant?

25:10.300 --> 25:11.900
Yes, I am.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.300
This was probably a bad idea. Excuse me.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.100
He's all yours.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.900
I came down here to talk to you.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.300
We need to talk.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.700
You make sure you show up tonight.

25:30.900 --> 25:31.800
Lauren?

25:32.100 --> 25:32.700
What?

25:32.700 --> 25:34.500
That guy's Lauren's dad. You know?

25:34.500 --> 25:36.000
- No, he isn't.
- He sure is.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.300
Lauren's got two dads,
but they're not - Never mind.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.900
How do you know him,
and how does he know you?

25:39.900 --> 25:41.500
I have to get back class.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.600
Yes you better run.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.100
Criminy.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.400
Maybe Amy shouldn't be back in school
here.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.800
Maybe this is ??? school.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.700
Language.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.100
Psst, Madison.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
What's going on? Did you tell Amy?

26:02.500 --> 26:03.700
No, not yet,

26:03.700 --> 26:07.300
but I better because my dad just showed up
and had Ricky pulled out of class.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.700
Your dad dad.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.100
Yeah. I saw him drive up in the parking
lot so I got a bathroom pass,

26:12.100 --> 26:14.400
and then I saw Ricky in the principal's
office.

26:14.400 --> 26:18.800
Your dad drove all the way up here just to
yell at Ricky because you guys made out?

26:18.800 --> 26:19.700
Yeah.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.500
Kind of extreme, right?

26:21.500 --> 26:22.900
Well, unless...

26:23.200 --> 26:24.500
Unless what?

26:26.600 --> 26:27.700
Oh, no.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.900
You don't think that Ricky's...

26:30.100 --> 26:31.700
in treatment?

26:31.800 --> 26:32.900
I bet he is.

26:32.900 --> 26:33.900
Well,

26:34.100 --> 26:38.900
if he is, then that's confidential,
so we can't say anything to anyone.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.000
OK. Yeah, that would be privileged
information.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.200
???

26:46.200 --> 26:48.700
??

26:48.700 --> 26:51.900
???

26:51.900 --> 26:56.700
??

26:56.700 --> 26:58.500
OK! OK.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.300
I speak Spanish, too, you know?

27:01.600 --> 27:03.700
So let's just settle down. Settle down.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.500
Sintense, por favor.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.100
The both of you.???

27:08.100 --> 27:09.000
If you will.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.700
Who told you to look up your father
anyway, huh?

27:17.700 --> 27:20.500
If I'd wanted to introduce the two of you,
I would have done it.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.500
We had an agreement.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.600
Are you stupid?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.100
You didn't have an agreement with me.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.900
Didn't you think I would look him up
at some point?

27:29.200 --> 27:31.700
Mawas just curious as to where
I got my brain from,

27:31.700 --> 27:33.200
'cause it wasn't from you.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.700
What makes you think I'm not smart?

27:35.700 --> 27:37.600
We live in a cheap condo.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.600
And we have enough money for you
to go to college for four years.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.600
I am very good with money,
and I work very hard for you.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.700
Maybe you should have asked
for child support, huh?

27:47.700 --> 27:50.100
Your father got married
when you were six months old,

27:50.100 --> 27:51.800
and he started his own family.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
He never really wanted to marry me.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.200
He just wanted to sleep with me.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.800
Oh, and you didn't want to sleep with him?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.100
Please.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.900
I just wanted someone to love,

28:03.300 --> 28:06.700
and I wanted someone that would love me,
too,

28:06.900 --> 28:08.800
even if that someone was a baby.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.800
So I got pregnant...

28:11.200 --> 28:12.500
on purpose.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.900
And then I felt guilty and ashamed
of myself

28:16.900 --> 28:18.900
for trying to trap him up in a marriage,

28:19.400 --> 28:21.000
so I insisted he stay away,

28:21.300 --> 28:24.500
and I was OK with that because I thought
you would love me.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.100
And guess what.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.100
You don't love me...

28:33.400 --> 28:35.700
...and I can't make you love me.

28:39.500 --> 28:43.500
maybe I love you more than we think.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.000
Please don't let him take me.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.900
I won't, baby. I won't.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.800
I won't let him take you away,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.700
but I do think you should see him,

28:56.300 --> 29:00.100
and I think your father and I should
help you make some changes in your life.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.200
So once again, you're the hero.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.300
Calling for help hardly makes me a hero.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.100
So who was it? Who beat him up?

29:12.100 --> 29:14.300
I don't know, I really don't,

29:14.600 --> 29:15.900
but he looked terrible.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.100
It's just stupid for her to be
in school here.

29:18.900 --> 29:21.800
Well, I know that, and I won't be
coming back.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.300
Amy, wait.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.600
It's just not right. She should be here.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.000
People are so cruel.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.600
Yeah, they are, which is why she should
have stayed away.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.000
I need a friend, Grace, more than ever.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Me too.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.700
I heard Jack has a new girlfriend.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.600
And I heard Adrian may be leaving school
to go live with her father.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.700
You lied to me, George.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.000
I know that Amy was not
at the extension school.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.200
What makes you say that?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.200
I called them.

29:59.900 --> 30:00.900
That was clever.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.000
Well, things here are great.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.300
Ashley and I are bonding.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.600
We're just gabbing, chatting, talking.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.800
I'm sure she's just as amused
by you as I am.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.900
Just tell me, is Amy going to the
new school tomorrow or not - yes or no?

30:11.900 --> 30:12.800
Where are you?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.900
I'm in a bar, George.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.300
I'm waiting for a room.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.300
The hotel was overbooked because
of the del-

30:18.300 --> 30:21.300
Why am I even answering your questions
when you're not answering mine?

30:21.300 --> 30:24.000
You're in a bar, huh? Well, la-di-dah.

30:24.100 --> 30:24.900
you know why..

30:24.900 --> 30:27.300
I'll just have Amy call me later,
and I'll talk to Ashley then.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.200
Good night.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.100
Good night.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.600
Love you, too, honey.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.600
Anne?

30:37.100 --> 30:38.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.000
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing -

30:42.600 --> 30:43.500
Truce?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.700
Your mother was probably right

30:56.900 --> 30:59.100
I should have put the cheese on
before I heated it up.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.200
And I should have made your sister go
to the -

31:06.400 --> 31:09.400
The Alternative Extension School
for Independent Women.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.800
I'm glad I can still make you ??

31:18.700 --> 31:19.600
Poor Amy.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.300
Yeah.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.500
And poor Ben.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.700
I wonder where his little sidekick
was today - Harry.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.700
Henry?

31:28.300 --> 31:28.900
Henry.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.500
I mean, he's cute, but he's a geek.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.400
He was probably plugged into something
when he missed the fight.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.900
Probably, 'cause he is a geek.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.900
Personally, I like geeks like Henry.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
He knows he's not gonna get laid
in the next ten years.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.700
- Low expectations.
- Thanks.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.900
No, I mean, he's not gonna try
to have sex with you.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.900
Dad, I'm not Amy, OK?

31:48.900 --> 31:51.300
I'm not completely clueless about guys.

31:52.300 --> 31:56.000
And Henry's totally on the rebound
right now. He's stupid.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.900
But even if he wasn't, I'm 12.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.700
Thirteen.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.100
I know you have condoms.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.000
- You don't know that.
- I do. I know.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.500
- What, did Amy rat me out?
- She sure did.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.900
But don't be angry with her.

32:09.900 --> 32:13.400
And don't you have sex until you're out
of this house, living on your own, kitten.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.900
It's not like you waited.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.000
I hate myself,

32:17.800 --> 32:19.400
and that's all I'm gonna say about that.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.000
Yeah, I hate you, too, sometimes.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.600
???

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
Thank you sweetie.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.000
I love you, too.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.800
I think Lauren's doin' ???

32:35.500 --> 32:37.800
I feel betrayed. I feel totally betrayed.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.900
You're the one person I trusted
on this earth.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.500
I don't tell patients who my family is.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.900
I didn't know our paths would ever cross,
but now that they have, guess what.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.100
I'm angry, too.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.100
Really angry.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.200
I thought you were actually
making sprogress.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.800
I thought you were gonna be
more responsible.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.300
I IFght you were finally gettin'
 some self-respect,

32:56.300 --> 32:57.900
but that was just a lie.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.700
A new lie, and even I fell for it.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.000
You intended to be responsible,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.600
and then you discovered that
if you just pretend to be responsible,

33:07.600 --> 33:09.800
you could continue on your merry way,

33:09.800 --> 33:12.500
trying to have sex with every girl
you get your hands on.

33:12.500 --> 33:16.700
And then next one is not - repeat not -
gonna be my Lauren.

33:16.700 --> 33:18.900
No, Lauren's not gonna be the next one.

33:19.300 --> 33:20.300
Grace is.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.600
I'm in love with Grace.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.500
Love.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.000
You're not in love with anyone.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.300
You can't truly be in love
with someone else

33:26.300 --> 33:28.200
until you find a way to love yourself,

33:28.200 --> 33:29.600
and you can't do that,

33:29.600 --> 33:32.300
and I obviously can't help you do that.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.700
I thought I could, but...

33:34.100 --> 33:35.200
I can't.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.700
Maybe I been lying to myself, too.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.600
Maybe I can't help anyone,

33:39.800 --> 33:42.300
because of all the people
who have come into this office,

33:42.300 --> 33:45.600
you are the one that I've invested
the most time in,

33:45.600 --> 33:49.700
you are the one that I have made myself
available to always,

33:49.900 --> 33:51.200
and look at where we are.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.100
Look at where we are.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.300
Nowhere.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.000
Do you want help?

33:58.500 --> 34:01.500
So that someday maybe you could be the guy
for Grace Bowman?

34:01.500 --> 34:03.600
She accepts me for who I am right now.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.800
Here we go again.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.500
It's one step forward and two steps back
with you.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.500
Maybe I need a new shrink.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.600
Maybe you do.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.100
But if you go near Lauren again,

34:16.400 --> 34:17.900
you're gonna need new teeth.

34:22.699 --> 34:23.800
It's me.

34:29.199 --> 34:29.900
Hey.

34:30.699 --> 34:31.900
My dad told me you called.

34:32.199 --> 34:32.800
Come in.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.000
So, how's everything with Alice?

34:39.199 --> 34:40.500
Did you two break up already?

34:40.500 --> 34:42.600
There's nothing going on with Alice.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.199
We just have a lot in common.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.600
We both love football,

34:45.900 --> 34:47.800
we both wanna have sex,
but not with each other,

34:48.800 --> 34:51.900
and we wanted to make you
and Henry jealous.

34:51.900 --> 34:52.800
Really?

34:52.900 --> 34:56.600
Because jealou isn't a strong basis
for a relationship, you know that?

34:56.600 --> 34:59.600
Yeah, but sometimes jealousy makes you
realize how much you love someone

34:59.900 --> 35:01.800
and how attracted you are to that someone.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.600
My dad let you come over so you could
tell me you still wanna have sex with me?

35:05.600 --> 35:08.400
No, not exactly. i mean I still wanna
have sex with you.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.400
I just promised your parents I wouldn't
even try to have sex with you.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.800
OK, I see.

35:14.300 --> 35:16.500
Well, you know what, Jack?
I don't know if I believe you.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.300
Would you be willing to wear a chastity
ring?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.900
That goes on your finger, right?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.100
- Yeah.
- OK.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.900
Yeah, I knew that. Um...

35:25.600 --> 35:28.900
yeah. I mean, I see that you're
still wearing yours, so, sure.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.200
I'd be willing to do that.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.700
Symbol of my promise to your parents.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.700
My dad's a minister, and he doesn't even
make me do that,

35:34.700 --> 35:36.800
but I'd be willing to do it for you.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.700
All of this started when I put this ring
on my finger.

35:39.700 --> 35:40.700
So you know what?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.000
I'm gonna take it off.

35:43.700 --> 35:44.700
All right.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.000
No, I'm taking it off because I don't
need it.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.300
I'm not tempted to have sex
with you anymore.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.300
I'm not tempted to have sex with anyone,

35:52.300 --> 35:55.400
especially after what I saw happen
to Ben today because of Amy.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.300
You mean because of Ricky, don't you?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm not stupid.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I know you weren't the least bit jealous
when you saw Alice with me.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.300
You were just surprised.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.300
No,

36:04.600 --> 36:06.400
if you're jealous of anyone, it's Adrian.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.400
And you probably heard she might
be leaving school,

36:08.400 --> 36:09.800
which would make Ricky available.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.400
Which, the more I think about it,

36:12.400 --> 36:15.000
is why your dad let me come over
in the first place.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.300
I'm kind of the lesser of two evils,
you know?

36:17.900 --> 36:18.700
Friends?

36:18.700 --> 36:20.200
Grace, we're not gonna be friends.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.900
I got Alice for that.

36:21.900 --> 36:23.100
Goodbye, Jack.

36:23.700 --> 36:24.700
Bye, Grace.

36:38.700 --> 36:39.700
What?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.900
I don't think Mom and Dad should have
asked me to wear that.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.400
I think it's kinda hypocritical.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.100
What?

36:44.100 --> 36:46.900
I don't think Mom and Dad waited
till they were married to have sex.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.000
I think they just told me that they waited
so I would wait until I was married.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.400
You lost your mind.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.800
You going have sex with Ricky.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.200
Not until we're married.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.100
I'm gonna live my life as a Christian,

37:00.900 --> 37:04.600
and I'm gonna pray that he wants
to live his life as a Christian with me.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.100
Sorry.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.500
Sorry.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.600
This was a bad idea.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.900
A really bad idea.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.700
Well, you don't have to agree with me.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.500
You looked like you had a little fun.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.900
You were watching me?

37:29.900 --> 37:31.600
Of course I was watching you.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.900
It's my first time.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.300
I wanna remember it.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.700
People write songs about their first time.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.400
You don't write songs.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
You don't know that.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.100
Yes. I do.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.600
Henry,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.100
that's the problem.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.600
I know everything about you.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.200
You know everything about me.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
We're boring.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.300
Oh, and Jack's not boring?

37:51.300 --> 37:53.000
He wasn't at first.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.900
I was excited when he asked me out,

37:54.900 --> 37:56.100
and I though

37:56.100 --> 37:58.500
he might make you a little bit jealous,

37:58.800 --> 38:01.100
and that might heat things up between us.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.700
I wanna be in love, Henry.

38:04.700 --> 38:05.800
Me too.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.700
Why aren't we in love?

38:07.700 --> 38:09.500
We've been together forever.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.100
I thought we like we were in love
if we just had sex.

38:14.100 --> 38:14.700
Yeah.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.000
Me too.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.500
Maybe if we tried again.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.500
Maybe if we used a different coom?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.700
- Maybe one of those ribbed ones?
- No, thank you.

38:26.900 --> 38:27.800
Well...

38:30.200 --> 38:32.700
I'm happy you were my first.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.700
I'm happy you're my first.
At least we're friends.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.700
I think I'm gonna cry now.
Perhaps you should leave.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.800
Come here.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.200
- Hey.
- I'm so glad you're home.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.000
You're not goin' with your dad, are ya?

38:54.000 --> 38:54.700
No.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.300
And I'm not staying here with my mother,
either.

38:57.700 --> 38:58.600
I'm leaving.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.000
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.300
Leaving.

39:01.800 --> 39:02.800
Come on, Ricky.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.100
Let's go somewhere.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.600
Together, just you and me.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.800
Somewhere far away, or just the bedroom?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.900
Don't joke around with me right now.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.700
Please don't.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.300
Adrian, it's not good to run away
from your problem.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.600
This is all good.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.500
You have a dad who wants to be a part
of your life.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.000
You and your mother are talking.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.900
Why would you run away now?

39:19.900 --> 39:21.100
What are you so afraid of?

39:21.100 --> 39:22.200
That someone's gonna love you?

39:22.200 --> 39:23.600
Do you love me?

39:24.900 --> 39:28.400
'Cause my father and mother don't want me
to have sex with you or any guy right now.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.500
That's what this whole family bonding has
turned into -

39:31.500 --> 39:33.100
censoring my life.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.900
And I'm not ready for that.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.100
Are you?

39:37.100 --> 39:39.100
Well, if that's what's best then -

39:39.100 --> 39:40.600
If that's what's best for me?

39:43.400 --> 39:44.800
You'll find someone else.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.800
So go.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.800
Go be a father, go be a Christian,

39:48.800 --> 39:50.800
go be what you want.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.200
I can take care of myself,
just like I always have.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.000
I don't need you,

39:56.500 --> 39:57.700
and I don't need them.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.000
I can't believe this happened.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.600
Ben, I'm so sorry.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.000
This...

40:09.000 --> 40:11.700
This is all my fault, mine and my dad's.

40:11.700 --> 40:14.300
My dad shouldn't have made me
go back to that school.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.700
I should have just gone to...

40:16.700 --> 40:17.600
Oh, d-don't...

40:17.600 --> 40:18.500
Don't say it.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.000
Hey, you two gettin' hungry?

40:22.700 --> 40:24.900
o am I talkin' to?
You two are always hungry.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.400
Ready to eat, champ?

40:30.800 --> 40:32.200
you're lookin' better.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.400
I don't think this steak is doing
anything.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.900
?? it is.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.600
Meat's good for whatever ails you.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.300
Thanks, Mr. Boykewich.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.400
Again, I'm so sorry about everything.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.300
I'm Leo, honey.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.100
My father's Mr. Boykewich.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.100
And why are you apologizing?

40:47.400 --> 40:49.800
I mean, we've all been pushin' ya
to go back to that school.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Yeah, well,

40:51.500 --> 40:53.400
it was my last day at that school...

40:53.600 --> 40:54.500
Leo.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.700
Oh, you have to.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.800
I mean, otherwise,is was all for nothing.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.500
I mean, life is tough,

41:01.500 --> 41:04.700
and that's why it's good to have someone
you love by your side, holdin' your hand.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.100
So you can walk away from the rest
of the world together.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.000
???

41:35.200 --> 41:35.800
???

41:36.200 --> 41:38.700
Thanks for helping,
calling for help yesterday.

41:38.700 --> 41:39.700
No problem.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.900
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.600
But it's never gonna happen again,

41:43.900 --> 41:45.700
because today, things are gonna
be different.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.900
And, Amy, I never want you to feel
like you're alone here,

41:48.900 --> 41:50.800
because every girl at this school -

41:51.200 --> 41:54.100
well, almost every girl - feels like you
have every right to be here.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.400
We want you here,

41:55.400 --> 41:58.300
and we want you to know that we support
your decision to come back to school here.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.400
So I know that you guys don't really have
any classes together,

42:01.700 --> 42:03.200
so I'm gonna walk you to class.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.000
Me and all of your friends here,
we're gonna walk you.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.000
So, come on, let's change things today.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.100
Friends?

42:11.700 --> 42:13.800
??, I'm not sure I have any friends.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.100
I bet you do.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.200
Have a good day.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.600
You too.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.700
Don't worry.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.900
I got your back.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.500
I got both your backs.
