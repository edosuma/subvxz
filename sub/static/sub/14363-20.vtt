08:30.799 --> 08:32.799
Show him how good it tastes, guys.

08:32.801 --> 08:34.335
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

08:34.336 --> 08:36.370
Taste the lesson.

08:36.371 --> 08:38.740
O-okay. Chop Suey's making a move.

08:38.741 --> 08:40.808
We're done punishing you.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.409
How smart is your smart mouth now?

08:42.410 --> 08:44.412
Not very.

08:44.413 --> 08:46.949
I love you. I'm sorry. You
brought this on yourself.

08:52.087 --> 08:54.857
- [Cellphone ringing]
- [Snorts]

08:57.459 --> 08:58.693
Wha... [Sighs]

08:58.694 --> 09:01.462
I got the socks. I'm wearing the socks.

09:01.463 --> 09:03.731
They're awesome socks.
Mike: What was that about?

09:03.732 --> 09:05.933
I asked you to come down here,
and you send your friend Sean.

09:05.934 --> 09:08.236
What? I sent a proxy. That's a word.

09:08.237 --> 09:10.238
I don't want Sean. I want you.

09:10.239 --> 09:12.974
What difference does it make?
Why does it have to be me?

09:12.975 --> 09:14.742
Because I want it to be you.

09:14.743 --> 09:16.711
So just get your ass home on Saturday.

09:16.712 --> 09:19.747
Oh, my God! That is so
completely arbitrary.

09:19.748 --> 09:20.815
That's another word I learned.

09:20.816 --> 09:22.383
Just do it.

09:22.384 --> 09:24.051
Ugh! What?!

09:24.052 --> 09:25.887
It doesn't make sense
that it needs to be me

09:25.888 --> 09:26.954
instead of somebody else.

09:26.955 --> 09:29.157
Just explain it. I'm 21. I'm an adult now.

09:29.158 --> 09:31.125
[Sighs] You were an adult at 18.

09:31.126 --> 09:32.894
What?! Why didn't you tell me?!

09:32.895 --> 09:34.462
You owe me three years of adulthood.

09:34.463 --> 09:36.731
And that's when Mike was
forced to do something

09:36.732 --> 09:37.732
he didn't want to do.

09:37.733 --> 09:38.800
[Sighs]

09:38.801 --> 09:40.768
He pulled out the dad voice.

09:40.769 --> 09:43.771
[Sternly] Axl, home tomorrow.

09:43.772 --> 09:45.440
Okay.

09:49.878 --> 09:51.445
Hey, what are you doing?

09:51.446 --> 09:53.147
Well, I'm trying to figure
out which book to give away.

09:53.148 --> 09:55.483
They're having patron
appreciation day at the library,

09:55.484 --> 09:57.318
and if you give them a gently-used book,

09:57.319 --> 09:59.320
they'll give you a free
bookmark with tassel.

09:59.321 --> 10:00.888
So, you know, I want to beat the rush.

10:00.889 --> 10:03.791
Well, don't forget your jacket.
It looks like rain.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.193
Thanks, mom, 'cause I'm blind

10:05.194 --> 10:06.861
and I've never seen weather before.

10:06.862 --> 10:08.863
Okay, look.

10:08.864 --> 10:11.899
I know you're a teenager now and
you got to rebel a little bit,

10:11.900 --> 10:13.768
but this is not the Brick I know.

10:13.769 --> 10:15.736
I'm not enjoying the role
you're playing here,

10:15.737 --> 10:18.739
so you might want to retire
this character before I do.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.441
Well, I'm not exactly enjoying

10:20.442 --> 10:22.443
the "nagging mom" character, either.

10:22.444 --> 10:25.179
Hey, you better check
your attitude, mister.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.281
Why don't you check your attitude?

10:27.282 --> 10:28.716
Check your attitude.

10:28.717 --> 10:30.051
All right, you know what?

10:30.052 --> 10:31.752
I'm not gonna listen to
double-whispered nastiness.

10:31.753 --> 10:34.355
You're not going to the library
for patron appreciation day.

10:34.356 --> 10:36.824
You're gonna sit at that table
and write a paper about

10:36.825 --> 10:38.826
why it's important to respect your mother.

10:38.827 --> 10:39.994
- What?!
- That's right.

10:39.995 --> 10:43.397
3 pages, double-spaced, 12-point type.

10:43.398 --> 10:44.465
[Sighs]

10:44.466 --> 10:46.167
What font?

10:46.168 --> 10:48.103
Garamond.

10:54.209 --> 10:55.443
Whew.

10:55.444 --> 10:57.778
It's just so hard to know what to do.

10:57.779 --> 11:00.348
Not only that, I said I
would tell her by tonight.

11:00.349 --> 11:02.917
I mean, of course I am
flattered to be wooed.

11:02.918 --> 11:04.385
Who wouldn't be?

11:04.386 --> 11:07.154
And then there's the salary...
they're offering four figures.

11:07.155 --> 11:08.856
What?

11:08.857 --> 11:10.258
$10 an hour.

11:10.259 --> 11:11.926
I'm sorry, Sue.

11:11.927 --> 11:13.794
I just have to get this off my chest.

11:13.795 --> 11:15.763
I'm gonna confess that

11:15.764 --> 11:17.899
I'm a little envious I didn't get tapped.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.768
Oh, Brad. No, it's where you work.

11:20.769 --> 11:23.137
It is really hard to make your mark

11:23.138 --> 11:24.705
at the great hot dog adventure.

11:24.706 --> 11:26.040
I mean, how are you supposed to shine

11:26.041 --> 11:27.975
when you're only working
with three condiments?

11:27.976 --> 11:29.210
I know!

11:29.211 --> 11:31.846
I did graduate magna cum
relish from hot-dog college.

11:31.847 --> 11:34.982
How does that not put me on the
radar at Chop Suey U.S.A.?

11:34.983 --> 11:36.884
I didn't even think about that.

11:36.885 --> 11:39.053
Sue-y. It has my name in it.

11:39.054 --> 11:40.855
Ooh, it's like a sign!

11:40.856 --> 11:42.823
You know, I bet it's because I
dropped that gallon of mustard.

11:42.824 --> 11:44.191
Everybody saw it.

11:44.192 --> 11:46.694
It's those damn free hand-lotion
samples at Crabtree & Evelyn.

11:46.695 --> 11:47.795
How can you not try them?

11:47.796 --> 11:49.964
Anyway, this is about you. Go on.

11:49.965 --> 11:53.701
As much as it scares me to go
into international cuisine...

11:53.702 --> 11:58.172
You know, I got lean in... to Chinese.

11:58.173 --> 12:00.274
I am gonna work at Chop Suey U.S.A.

12:00.275 --> 12:01.409
Oh! Oh!

12:01.410 --> 12:03.210
And you get to wear the polo shirts

12:03.211 --> 12:05.413
with the golden dragon coiled
around the American flag.

12:05.414 --> 12:06.480
[Gasps]

12:06.481 --> 12:08.282
I am officially peanut butter and jealous.

12:08.283 --> 12:10.885
[Sighs]

12:10.886 --> 12:13.721
You know, the sooner you
get your paper done,

12:13.722 --> 12:15.323
the sooner you can be doing something fun,

12:15.324 --> 12:17.692
like taking that behind-the-scenes
tour at the library.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.028
I mean, where do those
librarians go on their break?

12:21.029 --> 12:22.830
You won't know 'cause
you're not on the tour.

12:22.831 --> 12:24.799
Actually, I am doing something fun.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.000
I'm reading.

12:26.001 --> 12:27.868
No, you're not.

12:27.869 --> 12:30.871
I'm reading a book in my mind.
I've memorized all my books.

12:30.872 --> 12:34.108
Now I'm turning the page... page 12.

12:34.109 --> 12:35.843
All right, stop it. Stop it right now.

12:35.844 --> 12:36.844
You're being punished.

12:36.845 --> 12:38.879
[Laughs] That's a funny part.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.047
I mean it, Brick.

12:40.048 --> 12:42.083
I know what's coming,
and yet I still laugh.

12:42.084 --> 12:43.884
That's how you know it's good writing.

12:43.885 --> 12:45.119
Oh, yeah?

12:45.120 --> 12:47.254
Well, I'm gonna stop you
from reading in your head

12:47.255 --> 12:50.825
by reading from one of my books out loud.

12:50.826 --> 12:53.294
"From homeless to sexy."

12:53.295 --> 12:55.196
"Just two years ago,

12:55.197 --> 12:57.865
Angela Mccollum was living
by the rail road tracks.

12:57.866 --> 13:00.368
She never dreamed that someday
she'd be walking down

13:00.369 --> 13:02.470
the red carpet in a size-2 gown."

13:02.471 --> 13:04.805
Kind of hard to concentrate, isn't it?

13:04.806 --> 13:08.009
"The author of the best-selling
cookbook 'Fabulous Foraging, '

13:08.010 --> 13:09.477
Angela confesses her life changed

13:09.478 --> 13:11.912
after a chance encounter
with Gwyneth Paltrow."

13:11.913 --> 13:13.314
[Chatter on television]

13:13.315 --> 13:15.049
- All right. I'm here.
- [Television turns off]

13:15.050 --> 13:17.051
Let's get this over with so
I can go back to my life.

13:17.052 --> 13:19.086
Bunch of dudes are filling up
the back of this guy's truck

13:19.087 --> 13:20.454
and throwing me a pool party.

13:20.455 --> 13:22.223
Well, as fun as that sounds,

13:22.224 --> 13:24.859
you might like the surprise
I planned for you.

13:24.860 --> 13:25.860
We're not moving the freezer.

13:25.861 --> 13:27.728
What?

13:27.729 --> 13:29.263
I came all the way down here for nothing?

13:29.264 --> 13:30.765
No, no. It's good.

13:30.766 --> 13:31.799
I got you to come home

13:31.800 --> 13:32.933
so we could go out and grab a beer.

13:32.934 --> 13:35.202
Oh, my God. Why would you do that?

13:35.203 --> 13:38.806
'Cause it's something a father
does with his 21-year-old son.

13:38.807 --> 13:39.940
You don't get it.

13:39.941 --> 13:41.409
I was gonna swim in the back of a truck.

13:41.410 --> 13:42.843
But then you trick me into coming here

13:42.844 --> 13:44.712
to have a beer with you...
that doesn't make any sense.

13:44.713 --> 13:46.213
No, it's a tradition.

13:46.214 --> 13:48.883
When I turned 21, my dad told me
to come help him move some manure.

13:48.884 --> 13:51.052
But when I got there, he took
me out for a beer instead.

13:51.053 --> 13:53.954
Why didn't you just ask me to have a beer?

13:53.955 --> 13:56.057
'Cause that's not the thing.

13:56.058 --> 13:57.958
I don't get it.

13:57.959 --> 13:59.994
You think you're coming home to work,

13:59.995 --> 14:01.128
and then you don't.

14:01.129 --> 14:02.763
You know, it's... it's a surprise.

14:02.764 --> 14:04.465
It's whimsical.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.200
But you don't like surprises.

14:06.201 --> 14:08.836
I know. And I'm not liking them
a hell of a lot right now.

14:08.837 --> 14:11.172
Hold on. So you didn't
actually move manure?

14:11.173 --> 14:12.740
No. There was no manure.

14:12.741 --> 14:15.476
But when my dad told me to
come help him move manure,

14:15.477 --> 14:17.812
I damn well ran over there to
help him move some manure.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.847
I didn't say I would and
then send somebody else.

14:19.848 --> 14:22.216
Was there or wasn't there manure?!

14:22.217 --> 14:23.217
There wasn't!

14:23.218 --> 14:24.819
The point is, if there was manure,

14:24.820 --> 14:25.986
I would have moved it.

14:25.987 --> 14:27.455
Fine. Whatever.

14:27.456 --> 14:28.856
Let's just go get a beer. I need one.

14:28.857 --> 14:30.791
I don't want to have a beer with you now.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.460
What?! Oh, I come all this way!

14:32.461 --> 14:34.762
Let's move the freezer or...
or get a beer or something.

14:34.763 --> 14:36.931
It's already moved. Your
brother made your mom mad.

14:36.932 --> 14:38.099
Okay, so the freezer's moved.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.300
Are we gonna get a beer or not?

14:39.301 --> 14:41.102
Not.

14:41.103 --> 14:43.704
Ugh! I don't understand what is happening.

14:43.705 --> 14:46.140
Look, this was a nice
thing my dad did for me

14:46.141 --> 14:47.808
when I turned 21, and I always thought

14:47.809 --> 14:49.009
when I had a son, when he turned 21,

14:49.010 --> 14:50.344
I would do the same thing for him.

14:50.345 --> 14:52.012
But you know what? Forget it.

14:52.013 --> 14:52.980
Tradition dead.

14:52.981 --> 14:54.849
No! Mnh-mnh. No way. I came all this way!

14:54.850 --> 14:56.317
You cannot not have a beer with me!

14:56.318 --> 14:57.952
This is happening, dad.

14:57.953 --> 15:00.955
Here I am approaching the
fridge, grabbing a beer.

15:00.956 --> 15:02.323
- [Bottles clink]
- Tradition alive again.

15:02.324 --> 15:04.458
- Nope.
- Look at me, having a drink with my dad,

15:04.459 --> 15:05.726
and you can't stop me.

15:05.727 --> 15:07.728
Oh, my God. Axl's got a beer!

15:07.729 --> 15:09.763
He's legal now, Sue. It's allowed.

15:09.764 --> 15:11.732
Mmm! This beer I'm having
with my dad is so good!

15:11.733 --> 15:14.335
You may be having a beer, but
you're not having one with me,

15:14.336 --> 15:15.936
'cause I'm going out for a beer...

15:15.937 --> 15:17.771
By myself!

15:17.772 --> 15:18.873
No! No! No! No!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.207
They showed a video in health class...

15:20.208 --> 15:21.742
"Sammy drinks after school"...

15:21.743 --> 15:23.010
And this is exactly what happened!

15:23.011 --> 15:25.713
Alcohol is tearing our family apart!

15:25.714 --> 15:28.716
Calm down. Everybody, calm down.

15:28.717 --> 15:31.019
Did you get the socks?

15:34.089 --> 15:35.389
Yep, Brick was younger than me,

15:35.390 --> 15:37.324
but he didn't realize who
he was dealing with.

15:37.325 --> 15:40.694
I had... what did I have?

15:40.695 --> 15:42.897
I don't even understand what
I'm supposed to be doing.

15:42.898 --> 15:43.998
[Sighs] What do you want?

15:43.999 --> 15:46.200
Do you want an opening sentence?
A conclusion?

15:46.201 --> 15:47.434
Who's gonna be reading this?

15:47.435 --> 15:48.969
I don't know! What did I say?

15:48.970 --> 15:50.804
Something about respect. Just do it!

15:50.805 --> 15:52.740
I don't even know what that means.

15:52.741 --> 15:55.142
My teachers know to give
me well-defined parameters

15:55.143 --> 15:56.710
for any writing assignment.

15:56.711 --> 15:58.913
Look, it doesn't have
to be a complete paper.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.149
Just make a list... 25 reasons
why you should respect your mom.

16:02.150 --> 16:03.951
Now, I'm gonna go watch "The Bachelor,"

16:03.952 --> 16:05.819
and I want this done before
they get to Puerto Rico.

16:05.820 --> 16:09.690
[Sighs]

16:09.691 --> 16:12.826
[Clears throat]

16:12.827 --> 16:14.828
Howdy, Edwin.

16:14.829 --> 16:16.197
Can I talk to you when you have a second?

16:16.198 --> 16:19.233
I've been waiting for
you to come to me, Sue.

16:19.234 --> 16:21.802
Or should I say "Sue-y"?

16:21.803 --> 16:24.171
Oh, my God. You know?

16:24.172 --> 16:26.040
But we met behind a plant.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.742
I've got eyes and ears all over this place.

16:28.743 --> 16:31.212
My physics teacher
moonlights at Orange Julius.

16:31.213 --> 16:32.980
[Sighs] Okay, I'm sorry,

16:32.981 --> 16:35.249
but this is just a really
good opportunity for me.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.718
I mean, I don't want to leave Spudsy's.

16:37.719 --> 16:40.254
I'm happy here. We're a family.

16:40.255 --> 16:42.056
And I love all my customers.

16:42.057 --> 16:45.793
But the truth is I have
to do what's best for me,

16:45.794 --> 16:48.829
so I am giving you my two weeks' notice.

16:48.830 --> 16:50.464
Is that how much time
you're supposed to give?

16:50.465 --> 16:51.699
Oh, would a month be better?

16:51.700 --> 16:53.234
Oh, God. I don't know what I'm doing!

16:53.235 --> 16:55.970
I'm not surprised Chop Suey U.S.A.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.004
Is trying to poach you.

16:57.005 --> 16:58.973
You're a natural-born food server,

16:58.974 --> 17:01.775
and I am not gonna give
you up without a fight.

17:01.776 --> 17:03.877
Mostly because I don't have
time to train someone new.

17:03.878 --> 17:05.179
The new "Mortal Kombat" just came out.

17:05.180 --> 17:07.881
So, if Chop Suey wants to play hardball,

17:07.882 --> 17:09.717
I guess I'm gonna have to play hardball.

17:09.718 --> 17:12.486
How does a nickel raise sound?

17:12.487 --> 17:14.755
An hour?

17:14.756 --> 17:16.423
Okay, sure.

17:16.424 --> 17:18.759
And I'll even sweeten the deal.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.829
From now on, you'll be reporting to work

17:21.829 --> 17:25.132
as the assistant manager
of condiment distribution.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.835
[Squeaks]

17:30.805 --> 17:32.706
Come on, Brick.

17:32.707 --> 17:34.408
I'm tired. I want to go to bed.

17:34.409 --> 17:36.343
Well, I want to go to bed, too.

17:36.344 --> 17:37.711
[Sighs] Well, how much have you got?

17:37.712 --> 17:39.380
What do you consider "got"?

17:39.381 --> 17:41.782
Okay, forget the list. One sentence.

17:41.783 --> 17:44.318
One sentence on why you
should respect your mom!

17:44.319 --> 17:45.754
How hard can that be?

17:49.891 --> 17:52.160
[Chatter on television]

17:54.696 --> 17:55.729
Whoa, peach fuzz.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.164
You have to be 21 to get in here.

17:57.165 --> 17:59.066
Let me see some I.D.

17:59.067 --> 18:01.035
Actually, I just turned 21,

18:01.036 --> 18:04.471
so, uh, thanks for carding me.

18:04.472 --> 18:07.041
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not buying it.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.042
I have to cut this up.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.343
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Hold on.

18:09.344 --> 18:10.811
That's [Chuckles] that's my license.

18:10.812 --> 18:13.848
Dad, tell him I'm 21.

18:16.084 --> 18:17.818
Oh. You got to believe me.

18:17.819 --> 18:19.219
I mean, would he be ignoring me this much

18:19.220 --> 18:20.487
if he wasn't my real dad?

18:20.488 --> 18:22.356
Dad! That's the only license I have!

18:22.357 --> 18:24.692
I already sold my fake one to my friend.

18:24.693 --> 18:26.460
- Dad!
- All right, all right.

18:26.461 --> 18:29.030
I'll vouch for him. He's 21.

18:33.802 --> 18:34.935
[Sniffles]

18:34.936 --> 18:36.437
[Grunts]

18:36.438 --> 18:38.739
Hi.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.274
Hey.

18:40.275 --> 18:41.742
What'll you have?

18:41.743 --> 18:44.111
I'm gonna buy this guy a beer.

18:44.112 --> 18:47.948
And I'll have, uh...

18:47.949 --> 18:50.218
What kind of European beers do you have?

18:52.821 --> 18:55.690
He'll have an American
beer, and I'm buying.

19:00.762 --> 19:02.763
Really?! Nothing?!

19:02.764 --> 19:04.164
I'm tired. [Sighs]

19:04.165 --> 19:05.833
- I can't think.
- A word!

19:05.834 --> 19:08.469
One stinking word why you
should respect your mom.

19:08.470 --> 19:10.071
[Insects chirping]

19:13.708 --> 19:15.143
Oh, come on!

_

19:30.885 --> 19:32.760
You know, I remember,

19:32.761 --> 19:37.231
when I was a kid, it was February.

19:37.232 --> 19:40.968
I was lying on the concrete basement floor.

19:40.969 --> 19:42.403
My mom was doing laundry.

19:42.404 --> 19:44.705
It was February, and I was thinking,

19:44.706 --> 19:48.342
"man, spring is never gonna come.

19:48.343 --> 19:51.045
There's never gonna be grass again."

19:52.814 --> 19:54.783
And now...

19:58.820 --> 20:01.188
It goes fast is what I'm saying.

20:01.189 --> 20:05.189
A minute ago, I was sitting in your seat.

20:05.693 --> 20:07.861
What do you mean? Before I came in here?

20:07.862 --> 20:09.396
No.

20:09.397 --> 20:12.801
I mean, I-it seems like I was just 21.

20:14.803 --> 20:17.337
Let's just drink.

20:17.338 --> 20:18.740
Okay.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.084
Happy Birthday.

20:31.085 --> 20:33.821
Oh, thanks.

20:33.822 --> 20:37.324
[Sighs]

20:37.325 --> 20:40.093
You watch much basketball at school?

20:40.094 --> 20:41.129
Mm-hmm.

20:47.702 --> 20:51.205
[Moans] I caved, Mike. I caved.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.272
[Groans]

20:52.273 --> 20:53.841
[Slurring] Can't talk.

20:53.842 --> 20:56.143
Axl drank me under the table.

20:56.144 --> 20:58.846
I'm not 21 anymore.

20:58.847 --> 21:02.015
Yep, it's a hell of a
ride raising teenagers.

21:02.016 --> 21:04.751
Luckily, you get some
rest stops along the way,

21:04.752 --> 21:06.754
otherwise you'd kill them.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.359
Let me get that for you, mom.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.262
Hey, I was still working... never mind.

21:15.263 --> 21:17.098
Thank you!
