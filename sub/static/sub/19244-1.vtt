00:42.041 --> 00:45.170
-Joel.
-Shh. No words, my love.

00:47.422 --> 00:51.176
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just not really
a "pound one out" kind of gal.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.344
I know, and that's great.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.430
You like romance and lavender candles

00:55.513 --> 00:59.267
and a massage with essential oils
and a wonderful meal but not too heavy.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.435
You're making fun of me.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.731
No. I'm only saying
that sometimes, maybe even now,

01:04.814 --> 01:06.733
-we might try...
-Humping?

01:06.816 --> 01:11.279
Like that rescue dog did
to that little girl at the Rite Aid?

01:20.872 --> 01:23.249
[woman] Jennifer Lawrence
chopped off her hair again.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.628
Everybody hates it like that
but she doesn't care.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.463
She's so bold.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.839
I wish I was bold.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.634
Am I bold? No, I'm not.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.636
I'm really upset
about the new toaster oven.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.806
I'd like to be 20 percent bolder.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.975
No, more, 80 percent. No, that's too much.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.770
Look at all the slack in these knobs.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.438
You can't set an accurate temperature.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.524
Yeah, I know, honey.
Did you send them an e-mail?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.944
No, I re-read it.
It came across a little crazy.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.070
Well...

01:52.153 --> 01:53.613
I need a car.

01:53.696 --> 01:56.741
I can't live here anymore without a car.
We're in the middle of freaking nowhere.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.536
-We're not buying you a car.
-You don't need to buy me a car.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.746
Buy Mom a new car, I'll take hers.
Like a normal family.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.040
-I like the Range Rover.
-Ah.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.000
You'd look good in that.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.211
Why don't you love Mom enough
to buy her a Range Rover?

02:09.003 --> 02:11.131
-[groans] Ow.
-Well...

02:11.214 --> 02:14.092
What? What is it? Are you all right?

02:14.175 --> 02:17.303
Yeah, I just have this, like, sharp...
[groans]

02:17.387 --> 02:18.471
Here, sit down.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.306
Oh. [sighs]

02:20.390 --> 02:21.766
Is Mom dying?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.560
-Stop it.
-I don't know, parents die.

02:23.643 --> 02:28.106
I'm not dying, honey.
I probably just ate something.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.193
[sharp breath] I'm fine.
See? All better.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.988
-Are you sure? You scared me.
-Yeah, me too.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.825
Makes you think... life is short.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.076
You're not getting a car.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.039
Maybe we can hang out after school.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.875
Go to the Tea Garden together.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.585
Why?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.671
Because I love you
and I don't see you very much.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.716
-I think this is working.
-[car trunk opens]

02:54.799 --> 02:56.759
-Joel.
-Dan.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.304
Noticed a light on in your den all night.

03:00.096 --> 03:04.183
Oh, okay. Someone's gonna
get in trouble. [chuckles]

03:06.102 --> 03:07.562
Just kidding, no one's in trouble.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.689
-Unusual, that's all.
-Dan.

03:09.772 --> 03:13.776
-I had trouble sleeping, so I was up.
-You had trouble sleeping?

03:15.195 --> 03:18.156
-Problem?
-Dan, leave people alone.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.533
-Cop brain, sorry.
-I'm not a cop, baby.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.493
-LA Sheriff's Department, all the way.
-Mm-hmm.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.413
Dickless over there is a cop.
Morning, puss.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.332
Another day in pretend law enforcement?

03:27.415 --> 03:29.542
Have a good day, Dan. Be safe.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.378
Santa Monica PD. Shitbirds.
[scoffs]

03:32.462 --> 03:34.714
Be careful today
chasing bad guys, honey bunch.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.592
Oh, that's right, they don't allow
pursuits in Santa Monica.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.719
Worried it might hurt somebody's feelings.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.722
-Just trying not to kill civilians, Dan.
-[baby coos]

03:42.805 --> 03:46.559

like the sheriff's department.

-Suck me, Rick.

[tires screeching, engines revving]

04:00.114 --> 04:01.950
Why do we gotta live between two cops?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.494
Why couldn't it be
two rival pastry chefs?

04:04.577 --> 04:06.663
-I don't know.
-See you at the Petersons'.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.373
Do you have everything you need?

04:08.456 --> 04:11.042
-[Abby] Yes, Mom.
-I'm just checking.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.502
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, honey.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.504
Abby.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.340
-You look so pretty today.
-[chuckles]

04:17.966 --> 04:20.885
Eric worships you.
You're the queen of his spank bank.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.804
Mom, please!

04:23.805 --> 04:25.139
[Abby] Okay.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.892
Hey, some of us girls
are going out tonight.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.561
Drinking, dancing, etcetera.
You wanna come?

04:30.645 --> 04:33.523
No, I can't, um, tonight.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.275
-But thank you.
-You're so flustered.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.818
We're not banging dudes.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.113
At least that's what we tell our husbands.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.574
You're funny. Have a nice day.

Sheila Hammond, say hello to Gary West.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.981
Gary was rocking it up in Sacramento.
Now he's all ours.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.735
-Hi, Gary. Uh, welcome aboard.
-Thank you, Sheila.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.403
I'm very excited to be here.

She's the pretty one.

the Peterson house today?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.494
We're gonna try, Carl.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.956
None of this "try" bullshit. Do it!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.125
Oh, you're yelling at me.

05:34.208 --> 05:38.129
The Petersons are nervous.
We cannot lose this goddamn listing.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.506
Well, this is the third time
these buyers have been at the house.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.175
-Get an offer!
-Mm-hmm.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.342
Get an offer.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.095
-That's what realtors do.
-Okay.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.349
Come on, I'll show you your office.
It's small.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.645
It's nice meeting you.
I'm so sorry you got yelled at.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.441
Same. I mean, nice meeting you,
not sorry I got yelled at.

-Well, actually both.
-[laughs]

06:06.449 --> 06:09.494
The master has been completely remodeled.

06:09.577 --> 06:13.206
Lots of light
and brand-new textured plush carpeting.

-All headed in the same direction.
-[all chuckle]

06:16.042 --> 06:16.918
It's just lovely.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.630
Do you know what my favorite thing
about the upstairs is?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.007
-The laundry chute.
-Oh, it's amazing.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.300
It was so--

06:43.820 --> 06:49.367
I'm sorry. We are gonna call a crew
and immediately get that cleaned up.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.079
[sighs]

06:53.162 --> 06:54.789
Maybe we should reschedule.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.251
Great idea. I could run you up
to that Cape Cod on Barnhill.

06:58.334 --> 07:02.630
No, please. I don't wanna make
everyone have to come back.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.133
I'm just gonna go use
the restroom really quickly,

07:05.216 --> 07:07.009
and call the cleaning crew.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.346
I'll be right back, excuse me.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.269
-Okay, other bedrooms.
-Yes, this way.

don't you think?

[retching and vomiting, faint]

07:31.868 --> 07:34.412
-I love the crown molding in here.
-Mmm.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.789
[retching and vomiting]

07:37.623 --> 07:39.208
-Just beautiful.
-Yeah.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.502
[Sheila grunting]

07:41.586 --> 07:42.879
I wanna leave.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.632
Sheila.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.844
-[knocking]
-Sheila-- Oh, my God.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.351
Oh, my God, Sheila.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.983
Sheila. Sheila? Sheila.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.612
Oh, God.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.032
Oh, God.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.783
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.037
Oh! Sheila.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.831
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.587
-Did we get the offer?
-[gasps] Oh, what the fuck?

08:25.171 --> 08:26.672
I'm okay.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.342
I just threw up.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.427
Like a fair amount.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.429
Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
And that came out of me.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.106
Do you think it's an organ?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.740
I really am feeling better, honey.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.367
I wanna get you looked at.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.327
[sighs] We've been here
over three hours.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.830
I just wanna go home, get out
of these clothes and take a bath.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.833
I feel like a bus station
shit in my mouth.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.381
[pats his thigh]
I'll go see what's happening.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.259
Excuse me.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.263
Do not ask me again
how long it's gonna be.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.473
This isn't a deli counter.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.352
The most life-threatening conditions
have priority. Your wife threw up.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.563
-A lot.
-Your wife threw up.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.524
-A lot.
-Okay, we're not doing this.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.071
[mutters] Hold on.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.950
Gonna call your doctor
and make you some soup.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.368
You lost a lot of fluids.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.745
Mmm...

09:40.997 --> 09:43.583
I'm okay with you smoking pot.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.126
Excuse me?

09:45.209 --> 09:47.211
I know I complain about it
so you try to hide it,

09:47.295 --> 09:50.965
but I just want you to be
the Joel you want to be.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.342
-That's...
-[vehicle approaching]

09:54.176 --> 09:55.386
-That's really nice, sweetheart.
-[door opens]

[ajar door alert chiming]

09:56.887 --> 09:59.765
-Sheila.
-Gary.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.518
This is Gary, the new realtor
I was telling you about.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.270
Gary, my husband, Joel.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.688
-Hey, Gary.
-Hi there.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.774
So how are you feeling?
I heard about your afternoon.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.235
-Much better, thank you.
-Oh, these are for you.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.321
And I made sure
the cleaning crew got in there okay.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.115
They took care of everything
so don't worry about that.

10:16.198 --> 10:20.286
-Thank you, Gary. That is so sweet.
-So sweet.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.663
Well, we'd invite you in, but--

10:22.747 --> 10:25.499
Don't even think about it. But listen--
Joel, can I talk to you a moment?

10:25.583 --> 10:27.585
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.047
Thanks for the flowers, Gar,
and all your help.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.632
No problem.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.301
Feel better.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.804
[house door opens, closes]

10:38.888 --> 10:40.348
That was a crazy amount of vomit.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.141
Well, I'm not a medical expert,

10:42.224 --> 10:44.268
so I can't say what
the proper amount of vomit is.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.812
-It was a huge amount.
-Are you a doctor, Gary?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.689
-No.
-Neither am I.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.400
So let's not dishonor that profession,

10:51.484 --> 10:53.235
which takes eight years
of intense training,

10:53.319 --> 10:55.655
by thinking we can give
medical opinions, okay?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
Fine, then let's just stick to facts.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.951
The homeowners came by,
they didn't like what they saw.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.745
So they don't want to work
with you anymore.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.372
They'll be working with me now.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.665
You're stealing our listing?

11:05.748 --> 11:10.044
No, the facts are they fired you,
then hired me.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.006
And that was an insane amount of vomit.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.388
Everything's good.
Gary just needed some advice.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.555
I helped him out.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.266
I can't feel my heartbeat.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.227
-What?
-My heart.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.813
I can't feel it.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.439
[Sheila sighs]

11:39.782 --> 11:41.951
[sighs] I love your hair.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.507
Yeah. Like that.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.262
Bingo. [exhales]

[soft instrumental music on PA]

12:13.899 --> 12:15.693
[sighs]

12:16.777 --> 12:18.946
-Can I help you?
-What?

12:19.029 --> 12:22.158
My manager noticed that you've been
staring at the stethoscopes

12:22.241 --> 12:24.076
for, like, a really long time.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.706
There's something happening with my wife.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.626
Oh, well, I'm only 20, so...

12:33.294 --> 12:35.087
Right. Sorry.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.673
Do you know the difference
between the dual-headed stethoscopes

12:37.756 --> 12:39.049
and the single-headed ones?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.720
Well, dual would be two.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.682
I see. So twice as many then.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.228
It's not just a physical thing,
she's acting different.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.318
I'm gonna get this one.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.614
It doesn't make sense.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.660
My jaw still kinda hurts.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.455
Then stop talking.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.343
I don't hear anything.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.345
-[Joel] I know, right?
-There's something else.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.182
But no one freak out because I feel fine.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.604
Look. No blood.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.105
Aah...

13:35.189 --> 13:37.024
Still, no one freak out.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.488
[thudding]

13:43.239 --> 13:44.323
Oh, shit.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.785
-[Sheila] Is the juice helping?
-Uh-huh.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.119
Yep.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.622
[Joel] I can cook that meat
for you, sweetheart.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.831
I'm fine.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.168
-We should go back to the emergency room.
-No.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.586
I'm sorry.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.173
Look, I know things are very wrong
but I feel good.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.509
I have all this energy and, like, a focus.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.136
I can't go to a hospital
where they're gonna put me in a tube

14:06.220 --> 14:07.471
and prick me and poke me.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.848
They might never let me come home again.

14:10.474 --> 14:13.686
Bad for you
because we're having spectacular sex.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.396
Ew.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.565
Ew!

14:18.399 --> 14:22.653
Whatever this is, we need to talk
to someone because we are not experts.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.029
And this is just the sort of thing

14:24.113 --> 14:26.407
the Internet will have
a lot of misinformation about.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.992
-[Abby] I know someone.
-Who?

14:28.075 --> 14:30.661
-A creeper.
-What's a creeper?

14:30.744 --> 14:34.582
The kind of a nerd who specializes
in disturbing, weird or gruesome shit.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.337
No pupillary response.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.089
Have you noticed any deteriorating flesh?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.632
-No?
-Blackening of the skin,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.175
digits or other pieces falling off?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.427
-No.
-Okay.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.222
-Um, have you eaten anyone?
-No.

14:51.098 --> 14:55.144
-But I may have thrown up an organ.
-No worries.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.274
-[slurring] Hello.
-We already said hello.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.359
From when you came in.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.446
I haven't had this many people
in my room before.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.239
-You're doing fine.
-Thank you.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.158
Do you guys want chairs?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.911
-We just want to know what's going on.
-Right.

15:13.287 --> 15:17.708
Well... she is dead...

15:17.791 --> 15:20.169
-and also undead.
-What the fuck?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.631
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.091
She's a... zombie?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.927
I don't like that word,
I think it's inherently negative.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.304
-I don't like it either.
-Let's not use it.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.474
I don't feel dead and undead.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.268
I feel the opposite. Totally alive.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.354
She's been very...

15:39.063 --> 15:40.814
-exuberant.
-Exuberant?

15:40.898 --> 15:42.983
Yeah, they're doing it a lot.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.693
Okay.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.572
Well, one thing we know about the undead
is they're completely driven by their id.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.284
The id is a part of the brain
that demands us to satisfy our desires.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.661
-I know what the id is.
-It just...

15:54.495 --> 15:56.789
-wants whatever it wants.
-I sit behind you in Psych.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.249
-I know.
-How could this happen?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.543
We're realtors.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.339
Well, most new viruses come from animals,
like monkeys or bats.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.049
As humans destroy their habitats,

16:07.132 --> 16:09.259
we're exposed to all kinds
of unfamiliar diseases.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.971
I mean, we're the real
so-called zombies, aren't we?

16:12.054 --> 16:15.391
Consuming everything we want
without any regard for consequences.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.435
As we destroy the Earth
so, too, do we destroy ourselves.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.691
So, then, a bat or a monkey?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.026
Maybe.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.113
Anything else we should know?
Not that we know anything.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.864
Always keep her fed.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.535
I'm pretty sure we don't want to find out
what happens when she's hungry.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.664
And if she starts to show more symptoms,
like, uh, deterioration or aggression,

16:38.747 --> 16:39.790
you may have to...

16:42.042 --> 16:42.918
What?

16:43.919 --> 16:45.421
[softly] Um...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.507
Bash her brains in.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.891
We're realtors.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.603
Okay, until we know more,
we cannot tell anyone about this,

17:01.687 --> 17:02.980
especially your mother.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.150
Although it is hard to imagine
how she'd blow this out of proportion.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.235
What a beautiful afternoon.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.903
[gasps] We should do something.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.698
-Let's buy a Range Rover.
-Fuck yeah.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.699
[Joel] No.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.493
We are going home
and coming up with a plan.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.828
We need answers.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.747
How'd this happen? How do we fix it?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.915
-Has it affected anyone else?
-Ooh!

17:24.460 --> 17:25.836
Look what I found.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.172
-Don't eat a snail.
-[Abby] Oh...

17:28.255 --> 17:30.424
[crunching]

17:32.468 --> 17:34.094
-Crunchy.
-Okay.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.804
[car engine revving]

17:36.889 --> 17:38.057
Oh, crap.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.604
Hey, Dan. How was work?

17:43.687 --> 17:44.772
-Lisa home?
-[Joel] No, no.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.899
Should be soon, though, I'm guessing.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.569
-Yeah, I don't know her schedule.
-What are you all doing here?

17:51.361 --> 17:52.571
What are you all doing here?

17:53.989 --> 17:55.741
[forced chuckle]

17:55.824 --> 17:56.825
That's funny.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.411
-We were just talking to Eric.
-Eric? Why?

17:59.995 --> 18:00.996
Because...

18:01.080 --> 18:04.208
we found a football in our backyard,
we thought it might be his.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.793
Eric doesn't own a football
or anything else

18:05.876 --> 18:07.294
that would make him come outside.

18:07.377 --> 18:11.507
That's exactly what he said,
only with less implied criticism, so...

18:11.590 --> 18:13.008
mystery not solved.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.470
Then, uh, where's the football?

18:19.556 --> 18:21.183
-Run.
-Mm-hmm.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.685
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
-Shoot her! Shoot her!

18:23.769 --> 18:25.020
[both laughing]

18:28.357 --> 18:29.983
We threw it back over the fence.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.361
So, as you would say, "case closed."

18:34.488 --> 18:37.074
"Shoot her, shoot her." Really?

18:37.157 --> 18:39.576
You would be a terrible partner
in a crime spree.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.078
Uh, it's called self-preservation.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.288
And it's an instinct
you should be happy I have.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.376
That is exactly what we don't want.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.710
Now Dan is suspicious.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.130
-What if he asks Eric about it?
-Eric won't say anything.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.341
-How do you know?
-Because Eric hates his stepdad.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.761
That's sad, I feel bad
Eric has a crappy stepdad.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.429
Maybe we should adopt Eric.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.306
Out of the question.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.768
Look, you need to fight this a little.
Be a little less impulsive.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.186
I'm hungry.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.689
And there's no hamburger left.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.357
[moans]

19:12.609 --> 19:15.904
I'll go get you some food,
but then we're coming up with a plan.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.406
-Keep her here.
-All right.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.950
-I'm serious, don't go anywhere.
-All right.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.331
[up-tempo music playing]

19:26.415 --> 19:27.749
-Whoo!
-[Abby cheering]

19:27.833 --> 19:31.044
You should slow down.
I need you to slow down. Please slow down.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.921
-Oh! Oh, God!
-Whoo-hoo!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.923
Faster, faster, faster!

19:35.007 --> 19:37.050
[salesman] Oh, ohh-ohh!

19:37.759 --> 19:39.136
[sighs]

19:44.349 --> 19:47.644
I got organic,
I don't know if that's still important.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.480
Oh. What happened to your hair?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.317
Where's your mom?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.028
-Yes!
-[all cheering]

19:56.111 --> 19:58.280
I'm glad you finally decided to join us.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.449
This is fantastic.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.660
From now on,
always include me in everything.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.206
I can't believe you just went out
and bought yourself a Range Rover.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.791
I've been wanting one
ever since this morning.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.211
I think it's great.
You're my new role model.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.546
Yeah, if we want something,
we should have it, damn it.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.714
End of story.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.758
I'm gonna get some of those
Christian Louboutins.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.093
They're fucking expensive, but fuck it.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.220
[all laughing]

20:21.303 --> 20:24.681
There's a cute guy at the bar
looking at you.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.143
Oh, hello, he is cute. Do you know him?

20:28.227 --> 20:32.439
Oh. His name is Gary.
He just moved here.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.400
You like him. Are you two gonna bone?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.778
-Lisa.
-What?

20:37.861 --> 20:40.113
We decided
we shouldn't deny ourselves things,

20:40.197 --> 20:41.740
and boning is a thing.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.702
[dance music playing]

21:09.559 --> 21:10.852
Sheila, let's go home.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.562
-No, honey, I don't want to.
-Yeah.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.439
Come on, let's dance.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.859
Sweetheart, you bought a car,
and now you're grinding on the neighbors,

21:17.943 --> 21:20.070
and this is not who you are.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.613
Maybe it is.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.408
Maybe it's who I've always wanted to be.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.118
Maybe it's not who you are.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.328
-Honey.
-Is there a problem?

21:28.412 --> 21:29.454
Oh, God, not you.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.207
Look, Joel, obviously you're upset,
but if Sheila doesn't wanna go with you--

21:32.291 --> 21:33.542
Shut up, Gary.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.919
-Sheila--
-Life should be fun, honey.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.172
And I don't care what
<i>Consumer Reports</i> says, that car is hot.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.299
She wants to have fun, Joel.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.010
And doesn't care what <i>Consumer Reports</i>
says. I heard her, Gary.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.012
-Sheila?
-Then maybe you should go.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.437
You know, 15 years ago,
I would have punched you, once.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.314
I might have dropped you.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.982
If not, you would have beaten
the hell out of me,

21:57.065 --> 21:59.818
'cause I just had the one move,
and you're a substantial man.

22:00.694 --> 22:05.949
But now I have a family,
a career, a life.

I'm not gonna be the guy
who gets into bar fights.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.330
-You mean loses bar fights.
-You're missing my point.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.957
You don't wanna get into a fight
because you're afraid you might lose.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.251
That is exactly wrong.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.337
-The losing is a given.
-Damn straight.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.422
-And it's irrelevant.
-You mean inevitable.

-You are.

a very simple concept.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.518
You are.

I really did, but maybe it doesn't.

about toaster knobs,

24:28.508 --> 24:30.010
Who sucks it up?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.595
This one's cheaper.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.432
Maybe I want to have fun,
drive a fancy car,

24:35.515 --> 24:37.893
dance like a sex lunatic, hmm?

24:37.976 --> 24:41.313
[rhythmic grunting]

24:41.396 --> 24:44.608
-You're a good dancer.
-You're missing the point, Ramona.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.152
I don't want to dance.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.988
And I don't want
another shitty toaster oven.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.198
I'm outta here.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.081
[gate latch opens]

25:00.165 --> 25:01.082
Hi.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.126
Gary.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.129
I rang the bell then I saw your car
in the driveway, so...

25:06.630 --> 25:09.007
I'm just gardening. It relaxes me.

25:09.883 --> 25:10.717
What's up?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.552
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.556
Because I didn't wanna have sex
with you last night?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.515
I'm fine.

25:17.599 --> 25:21.102
We were in the middle of dancing
and then you just strolled off.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.896
I had a lot on my mind.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.522
I ended up walking around all night.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.067
Checked out a Dumpster behind Chili's.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.611
They throw away a lot of raw meat.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.987
-[chuckles]
-Whoa, okay.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.490
-How about we start over?
-I don't think so.

25:33.573 --> 25:34.991
-Are you sure?
-I am.

25:35.075 --> 25:35.909
Are you?

25:35.992 --> 25:37.827
I feel like whatever I say

25:37.911 --> 25:40.413
is just going to mean
you push harder against my vagina.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.458
Okay, I was right.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.669
-Listen, Gary--
-Shh...

25:46.836 --> 25:47.712
How about this?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.048
We have some fun.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.383
You said you're all about fun.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.593
And I don't say anything
to your lame husband.

25:53.677 --> 25:58.390
Or we don't, and I tell him we screwed
four times last night in my beamer.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.607
Your unwillingness
to take no for an answer

26:07.691 --> 26:11.945
has made me feel sexy and desirable.

26:13.029 --> 26:13.947
Hmm?

26:16.574 --> 26:19.327
-[chuckling]
-Uh-huh?

26:21.663 --> 26:23.999
Oh. [sighing]

26:24.916 --> 26:27.919
-[crunching]
-Aaah! [muffled grunt]

26:28.586 --> 26:30.797
[moaning, gasping]

26:32.090 --> 26:35.176
I know, weirdest foreplay ever.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.886
[grunts, groaning]

26:36.970 --> 26:38.805
You ate my fingers.

26:38.888 --> 26:42.309
-I do not hate your fingers.
-"Ate," ate my fingers.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.145
Ohh... [moaning]

26:56.781 --> 26:59.367
[munching]

27:00.660 --> 27:01.661
Sheila?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.205
Sheila, we need to talk.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.832
Last night was bullshit.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.083
Sheila!

27:09.586 --> 27:10.837
Sheil-- [gasps]

27:12.881 --> 27:14.799
Oh, Joel.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.217
[exhales]

27:17.802 --> 27:20.013
I really want to make this work.
