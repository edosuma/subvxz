01:33.942 --> 01:35.279
Hey, it's Marsh.

01:36.279 --> 01:37.779
Mmm-hmm.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.650
Mmm-hmm.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.752
Hmm.

01:42.751 --> 01:43.920
Okay.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.212
When are you just gonna give
up on that thing and get a new one?

02:48.213 --> 02:50.080
Well, you know me.

02:50.081 --> 02:51.581
Love a lost cause.

02:52.749 --> 02:54.784
Where are you off to?

02:54.785 --> 02:58.088
Oh, new start down at
Tonto National Forest.

02:58.089 --> 03:00.091
Ate up 40,000 acres yesterday.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.663
Fixing to triple that today.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.867
You got something to say to me
before you walk out that door?

03:09.867 --> 03:12.235
Well, I guess I said some shit
last night I shouldn't have.

03:12.236 --> 03:12.749
Yeah. You did.

03:15.372 --> 03:17.007
Why?

03:17.008 --> 03:18.008
Because.

03:18.342 --> 03:20.310
Because what?

03:21.310 --> 03:25.881
'Cause you're smarter than I am,
especially when we squabble.

03:25.882 --> 03:28.449
And it pisses me off.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.253
Well, I can appreciate that.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.757
I bet you can.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.225
I guess we both made
some mistakes last night.

03:37.226 --> 03:38.629
Yes, we did.

03:40.629 --> 03:42.398
Let's make better
ones next time.

03:43.398 --> 03:44.702
Okay.

03:46.702 --> 03:48.370
God, I love you,
Manda-bear.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.842
I love you, too, Shortstop.

04:43.154 --> 04:45.589
Bla-blow wants to go with you.

04:46.957 --> 04:48.925
Bla-blow wants
to go with me?

04:48.926 --> 04:50.328
Crazy little guy.
Come here.

04:52.496 --> 04:54.026
- Can you take this little stinker?
- Yeah.

04:54.050 --> 04:55.170
He's not a stinker.

04:55.332 --> 04:57.092
- No, you're a stinker.
- No, I'm not.

04:57.301 --> 04:58.300
Mmm-hmm.

04:58.301 --> 04:59.669
She's a stinker.

Bye. Say bye.

05:01.137 --> 05:02.777

Put me down. Put me down.

05:05.742 --> 05:07.148
Oh, boy.

05:11.148 --> 05:12.614
Go, Mack!
Come on, buddy.

05:12.615 --> 05:13.615
Get that can, would you?

05:18.821 --> 05:20.488
Just 'cause you got
a crack in your ass

05:20.489 --> 05:22.727
don't make you a cripple,
Jesse. You get it.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.859
Air Attack Helicopter
741 en route with a full tank.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.061
Crew 7, can we get
a ground fix on the fire?

06:03.062 --> 06:05.730
Helicopter 741, this is Crew 7.

06:05.731 --> 06:09.100
Fire's running north-northwest
two miles out from our location.

06:09.101 --> 06:10.775
Copy that,
Crew 7. Thank you.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.019
Confirmed.
Clear to drop.

06:27.018 --> 06:28.886
Good work, 741.

06:28.887 --> 06:30.391
Copy that.

06:47.270 --> 06:50.040
You saw men, take five!

06:50.041 --> 06:51.373
Bravo Squad, take five!

06:51.374 --> 06:52.607
Powwow?

06:52.608 --> 06:53.608
Breaky.

06:54.577 --> 06:56.210
Yo!

06:56.211 --> 06:57.649
Huddle up!

06:59.649 --> 07:01.182
- Hey, agua me.
- Yeah.

07:01.183 --> 07:02.183
Alpha!

07:02.284 --> 07:03.785
I've got to throw
a new on the saw!

07:03.786 --> 07:04.786
Rosie.

07:05.620 --> 07:06.757
Chaw.

07:07.757 --> 07:08.757
Hot sauce.

07:08.758 --> 07:09.957
You look like a bag

07:09.958 --> 07:11.993
of smashed assholes right now.
You all right?

07:11.994 --> 07:14.661
I had a crazy night, bro.

07:14.662 --> 07:16.273
I finally hooked up
with that gal Cheyanne.

07:16.297 --> 07:17.297
- Yes!
- Cheyanne?

07:18.299 --> 07:21.836
The Cheyanne? The girl from the Emporium
with the tattoos and the beautiful eyes?

07:21.837 --> 07:23.404
- That's the one.
- Outstanding.

07:23.405 --> 07:24.885
What's up? Dude, Whitted,

07:25.272 --> 07:27.217
Mack closed that girl
from the Emporium last night.

07:27.241 --> 07:27.871
Cheyanne?

07:27.896 --> 07:28.641
Yeah.

07:28.642 --> 07:30.511
I see her at church now
and again. She doesn't talk.

07:30.512 --> 07:31.812
Yeah, she doesn't
need to though, right?

07:31.813 --> 07:32.512
I mean, like, unreal.

07:32.537 --> 07:33.045
Hey, guys.

07:33.046 --> 07:35.716
Guys, guys!
The man is clearly an artist.

07:35.717 --> 07:38.050
Let him share his gift.
MacKenzie, proceed.

07:39.385 --> 07:41.854
I mean, she went
full-blown medieval on me.

07:41.855 --> 07:43.135
I had to buckle in at one point.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.570
- Oh, God.
- I want to buckle in.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.126
I mean, there was just one thing that
she said that just threw me, though.

07:48.127 --> 07:48.881
Don't worry about it.

07:48.906 --> 07:49.994
What? Dude, you can't say

07:49.995 --> 07:51.496
there's something and then
"Don't worry about it."

07:51.497 --> 07:51.864
What was it?

07:51.889 --> 07:52.965
All right, all right, all right.

07:52.966 --> 07:55.633
Postcoital, we're laying
in bed. I grab the remote.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.536
Okay? I turn the TV on. I'm
flipping through the channel.

07:57.537 --> 07:58.616
I end up on an infomercial.

07:59.337 --> 08:03.742
In the background...
there's Mount Rushmore.

08:03.743 --> 08:05.644
And I'm trying to make
conversation at this point.

08:05.645 --> 08:06.211
It's awkward.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.211
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:07.212 --> 08:09.038
And I'm like, "Wow,
that's amazing."

08:09.063 --> 08:09.646
Right.

08:09.647 --> 08:11.749
Her rebuttal to this?

08:11.750 --> 08:16.355
"Especially when you realize
it's a natural thing."

08:17.355 --> 08:18.355
What? What?

08:18.356 --> 08:19.823
Oh, that's not good.

08:19.824 --> 08:20.249
What?

08:20.274 --> 08:21.525
You mean to tell me

08:21.526 --> 08:24.128
that this girl believes that the
faces of our four presidents

08:24.129 --> 08:26.231
showed up on a mountain
through the process of...

08:27.231 --> 08:28.377
natural erosion?

08:28.402 --> 08:29.165
Yeah!

08:29.166 --> 08:30.725
Wind and rain
carved out the presidents.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.538
Many forms of
intelligence, Mack.

08:32.563 --> 08:33.535
I love wind and rain!

08:33.537 --> 08:34.082
Oh, my God.

08:34.107 --> 08:35.371
Hey, honestly, Mack,

08:35.371 --> 08:36.839
this girl is perfect
for you, man.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.039
She's like a match
made in heaven.

08:38.041 --> 08:38.869
I'm proud of you.

08:38.894 --> 08:39.941
I haven't slept.

08:39.942 --> 08:41.486
Whitted, where you at?

08:41.510 --> 08:43.179
Whoo!

08:43.179 --> 08:45.748
We got a chain left
to finish the mop-up.

08:45.749 --> 08:47.381
All right, just get it done.

08:47.382 --> 08:48.849
Aye, aye, Papa.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.952
All right, boys, back to work.

08:53.555 --> 08:54.555
Jesse!

08:54.556 --> 08:55.622
Yeah, Supe!

08:55.623 --> 08:56.623
I'm gonna go scout ahead!

08:56.624 --> 08:58.025
You got it!

08:58.026 --> 08:59.696
Tree coming down!

09:00.696 --> 09:01.696
Falling!

09:05.434 --> 09:08.501
This showcase
is gonna burn, baby, burn!

09:08.502 --> 09:10.537
Nicole, welcome to the showcase!

09:10.538 --> 09:12.206
Zachariah,
welcome to the showcase!

09:12.207 --> 09:13.941
Guys, pay close attention
to the first showcase,

09:13.942 --> 09:15.576
because it could go to
either one of you. Here we go.

09:15.577 --> 09:16.577
Good luck.

09:17.746 --> 09:19.945
This five-station
home gym centers around

09:19.946 --> 09:21.780
a fully adjustable
weight set to help...

09:21.781 --> 09:24.951
I can't read that shit.
What's it say?

09:24.952 --> 09:26.418
From Hatch.

09:26.419 --> 09:29.790
"Saw Natalie working
Murph's last night.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.996
"Did you know she was pregnant?"

09:36.995 --> 09:39.898
Who's Natalie?

09:39.899 --> 09:43.435
Some chick I rolled with
a couple months back.

09:43.436 --> 09:46.171
Some rubber in your new car!

09:51.277 --> 09:52.846
What are you doing?

09:54.846 --> 09:57.115
What are you up to?

10:06.324 --> 10:07.592
Yeah.

10:07.593 --> 10:09.227
Bless your little black heart.

10:10.227 --> 10:11.895
What's up, Supe?

10:11.896 --> 10:14.930
The fire's gonna do
a 180 off the line.

10:14.931 --> 10:17.102
Division Charlie, it's Crew 7.

10:18.102 --> 10:20.069
Go ahead, Crew 7.

10:20.070 --> 10:24.141
Yeah, I think the fire's gonna go
toward homes to the southwest.

10:24.142 --> 10:25.807
What we'd like to do
is take my crew down

10:25.808 --> 10:28.410
to the eastern edge of
the creek and prep for a burn.

10:28.411 --> 10:31.612
Negative. We've got an inbound
hotshot crew to your division.

10:31.613 --> 10:33.650
They'll make the call.

10:34.650 --> 10:35.718
Copy that.

10:36.718 --> 10:38.353
Goddamn it.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.123
How y'all doin'?

10:42.124 --> 10:43.524
Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.527
My captain, Jesse Steed.

10:45.528 --> 10:47.894
Well, this fire's
gonna shift down here.

10:47.895 --> 10:51.466
I figured you and your crew should go
down and prep that creek for a burn.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.701
I don't mean any disrespect
to you California boys,

10:53.702 --> 10:56.870
but I was... Just been watching
this line for a few days now.

10:56.871 --> 11:00.507
The fire's gonna shift, probably jump over
to that neighborhood right over there.

11:00.508 --> 11:02.676
Okay, let me stop you right
there, okay? Marsh, is it?

11:02.677 --> 11:03.339
Yeah, it's Marsh.

11:03.364 --> 11:04.364
Yeah, well... Um...

11:05.312 --> 11:08.447
You guys are Type 2,
and we are hotshots.

11:08.448 --> 11:10.816
So, why don't you do
what deucers do best,

11:10.817 --> 11:14.128
which is stay in the back
and mop up our shit?

11:21.128 --> 11:23.002
Ladies.

11:29.002 --> 11:31.282
Maricopa County Sheriff's Office!

11:31.337 --> 11:32.917
This is a mandatory evacuation!

11:33.906 --> 11:35.242
Get in, Trevor!

11:42.681 --> 11:44.001
- Hey, Supe.
- Yeah.

11:44.249 --> 11:46.184
You're not gonna like this one.

11:46.185 --> 11:48.051
Smith and Landau are
cutting bait on us.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.886
What? God.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.023
A few slots opened up
on the Blue River Hotshots,

11:53.024 --> 11:55.058
and Ferguson's rolling out
the red carpet.

11:55.059 --> 11:57.861
Well, Blue River's a good crew.
Ferguson's a solid Supe.

11:57.862 --> 12:00.197
They'll probably make double
what we gave 'em.

12:00.198 --> 12:01.838
We could've saved
all these people's homes

12:02.266 --> 12:04.145
- if we ran the play that you called.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:04.268 --> 12:05.869
The boys are pissed.

12:05.870 --> 12:06.870
So am I.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.379
Hey, Sturgill.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.882
Amanda.

12:20.883 --> 12:22.883
Where'd you find this one?

12:22.884 --> 12:24.686
Tweaker lab outside of town.

12:24.687 --> 12:26.183
You arrest the guys that did it?

12:26.208 --> 12:27.089
Didn't need to.

12:27.090 --> 12:29.391
Dipshits blew themselves up
mixing a batch.

12:29.392 --> 12:30.691
Good.

12:30.692 --> 12:34.695
Attaboy.
There you go.

12:34.696 --> 12:37.064
We were gonna put him down,
but then Steinbrink said

12:37.065 --> 12:38.181
we should call you.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.262
So, what do you think?

13:10.328 --> 13:11.433
You're safe now.

13:13.433 --> 13:14.751
I promise.

13:38.123 --> 13:39.327
You're all right.

13:43.326 --> 13:45.527
Lie down.

13:45.528 --> 13:47.940
Good boy. Lie down.
Come on. Lie down.

14:16.692 --> 14:19.161
Who's this?

14:20.161 --> 14:22.199
New friend.

14:24.199 --> 14:26.906
Your friend got a name?

14:30.905 --> 14:32.405
Roscoe.

14:32.406 --> 14:33.745
Roscoe.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.683
You're dirty.

14:41.683 --> 14:43.751
You're filthy.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.751
You smell.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.860
So do you.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.820
I've been thinking about inviting
over some ranchers from the area,

14:58.298 --> 15:01.437
showing them the benefits of
having the horses go barefoot.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.274
Maybe I can drum up
some new clients.

15:09.274 --> 15:11.745
I'm pregnant with triplets.

15:13.745 --> 15:15.749
Willie Nelson is the father.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.684
I like Willie Nelson.

15:21.685 --> 15:24.390
Well, that's good.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.190
I'm sorry.

15:27.191 --> 15:28.858
It's just some shit
happened out on the line.

15:28.859 --> 15:30.796
Yeah. Shit always
happens on the line.

15:32.796 --> 15:34.865
You want to talk about it?

15:34.866 --> 15:36.566
Or you want to do
your John Wayne thing?

15:36.567 --> 15:38.366
There's nothing to talk about.

15:38.367 --> 15:40.872
Same problem.
It's just getting worse.

15:44.775 --> 15:46.780
Have you reached out to Duane?

15:50.780 --> 15:51.915
Well,

15:52.915 --> 15:54.950
maybe...

15:54.951 --> 15:57.625
He can help you
get the crew certified.

16:02.625 --> 16:03.625
Hmm.

16:04.327 --> 16:04.633
What?

16:08.429 --> 16:09.596
What?

16:09.597 --> 16:11.165
Why are you so good to me?

16:11.166 --> 16:12.633
Hell if I know.

16:18.005 --> 16:19.116
Bye, have a nice night.

16:19.141 --> 16:20.299
Thank you so much.

16:21.275 --> 16:22.643
Hey.

16:33.653 --> 16:36.189
Yes, it's yours, I'm sure.

16:38.292 --> 16:39.995
Damn.

16:41.994 --> 16:43.834
Uh, all right, how long
have you been pregnant?

16:44.263 --> 16:44.783
Five months.

16:44.808 --> 16:46.324
Five months? Are you serious?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.244
Dude, you're not even gonna tell me,
maybe earlier or something?

16:49.268 --> 16:50.803
Brendan, 'cause I don't
wanna hear it. I don't.

16:50.804 --> 16:52.404
Well, look, I deserve
a say in all this.

16:52.405 --> 16:53.255
Okay, then what
do you wanna say?

16:53.280 --> 16:53.905
I called you, I've...

16:53.906 --> 16:55.708
Say something!

16:55.709 --> 16:56.709
I don't know.

16:56.710 --> 16:57.842
You don't care about me.

16:57.843 --> 17:00.177
You never did.
You broke up with me with a text.

17:00.178 --> 17:01.846
Yeah, I know.
Look, I didn't know.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.179
Yeah, and what if you did?

17:03.180 --> 17:04.414
What would you have done?

17:04.415 --> 17:05.417
Marry me?

17:07.417 --> 17:08.417
All right.

17:09.355 --> 17:11.887
Look, that is part mine, okay?

17:11.888 --> 17:13.757
It is. So...

17:13.758 --> 17:16.358
I'm gonna be responsible for it.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.896
You're not responsible
for anything.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.336
My family and I
have this on our own.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.335
I want you to stay away.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.141
If that's what you want.

17:32.675 --> 17:33.875
Damn.

17:37.314 --> 17:40.225
We catch you doing that shit in here
again and we'll make you choke on it.

17:41.984 --> 17:43.020
Asswipe.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.421
Shit, B.

17:45.422 --> 17:46.991
You okay?

18:23.323 --> 18:25.390
I've been dreaming of this.

18:25.391 --> 18:27.560
The day you bring me
up here to the point.

18:27.561 --> 18:29.128
Oh, God, would you stop?

18:30.930 --> 18:32.701
What the hell are we doing here?

18:34.701 --> 18:36.803
Take a good hard look out there.

18:37.803 --> 18:38.803
What do you see?

18:40.607 --> 18:41.607
Fuel.

18:42.242 --> 18:44.877
Lot of good folks lost
their home down at Cave Creek.

18:44.878 --> 18:46.378
Bitch kicked your ass, huh?

18:46.379 --> 18:47.544
Mmm-hmm.

18:47.545 --> 18:50.483
But had I been able to cut and burn
the lawn, we could've kicked hers.

18:51.482 --> 18:52.916
Tough beat.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.917
We've been training
for over four years.

18:54.918 --> 18:58.755
We've got all our hours,
all our qualifications,

18:58.756 --> 19:00.824
can out-hump any
hotshot crew out there,

19:00.825 --> 19:03.493
but until we're certified, we ain't
nothing but a bunch of deucers.

19:03.494 --> 19:04.894
We can't do anything.
Can't do shit.

19:05.263 --> 19:09.331
Well, I told you
it wouldn't be easy.

19:09.332 --> 19:12.167
Doing something that's never
been done before takes time.

19:12.168 --> 19:15.538
You know I lost two more
good dudes to Blue River?

19:15.539 --> 19:18.642
City council and mayor have got
my ass on the chopping block.

19:18.643 --> 19:20.376
We ain't got any more time.

19:20.377 --> 19:22.011
Neither does our hometown.

19:22.012 --> 19:24.378
Sooner or later, the fire,
she's gonna come a-knockin',

19:24.379 --> 19:27.116
and when she does, this whole place
is gonna go off like a powder keg.

19:27.117 --> 19:30.652
And when she does, my crew won't even
be able to set foot on the line.

19:30.653 --> 19:33.120
Eric, that attitude
that you got right there,

19:33.121 --> 19:35.041
that cost you a lot of friends
in the department.

19:35.191 --> 19:35.572
I don't care.

19:35.597 --> 19:36.757
Friends that could've helped.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.163
Come on, Duane, you're
the Wildland fire chief.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.133
You started this thing.

19:45.134 --> 19:46.134
Well...

19:49.704 --> 19:51.048
I need your help.

20:00.047 --> 20:02.047
Please?

20:02.048 --> 20:03.916
Hey. Now, that's nice.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.922
That's a good start.

20:07.922 --> 20:09.891
Come on, we'll get this thing.

20:10.891 --> 20:12.528
Look, listen, I'm in...

20:13.527 --> 20:14.967
Camp Verde Jail.

20:15.428 --> 20:17.595
And, uh...

20:17.596 --> 20:21.333
Nah, it was just, like, a
misunderstanding, or whatever, honestly.

20:21.334 --> 20:23.768
But the bail's, like,
a grand, so I was...

20:23.769 --> 20:25.504
I was seeing if you
could post that.

20:27.740 --> 20:28.740
Hello?

20:30.374 --> 20:32.477
Mom?

20:32.478 --> 20:37.481
Now, there are two things
that'll make the mayor move.

20:37.482 --> 20:38.982
Sorry, baby.

20:38.983 --> 20:40.718
Fear and greed, right?

20:40.719 --> 20:44.421
Yeah, but until the fire's knocking
at his door, we don't have the fear.

20:44.422 --> 20:48.891
Yeah, once the crew gets certified
as hotshot, then the city,

20:48.892 --> 20:52.329
they can charge 49 bucks
an hour per man

20:52.330 --> 20:55.364
when they're working a fire on
federal or state land, right?

20:55.365 --> 20:57.333
This is bringing money
into Prescott.

20:57.334 --> 21:00.469
Wait, don't they have to get
evaluated so they can get certified?

21:00.470 --> 21:02.937
I'm gonna get them
their evaluation.

21:02.938 --> 21:05.941
Now, if you're willing
to commit your boys

21:05.942 --> 21:08.703
to working more than what the average
hotshot crew covers in a season,

21:09.213 --> 21:11.046
I'm talking about
a lot of overtime, now...

21:11.047 --> 21:12.207
Yeah, it's no problem.

21:12.282 --> 21:14.716
We'll work the full
fire season, no breaks.

21:16.586 --> 21:17.586
I'm so sorry.

21:18.419 --> 21:19.754
You okay?

21:19.755 --> 21:21.056
Yes, thank you.

21:32.901 --> 21:36.771
It's not easy sharing your man
with a fire. I know.

21:36.772 --> 21:39.040
I'm just being a baby.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.074
You know, I don't even know why,

21:41.075 --> 21:44.378
when I went into this
with my eyes wide open.

21:44.379 --> 21:46.949
Doesn't mean you can see
everything that's coming.

21:48.949 --> 21:50.449
It's important to him.

21:50.450 --> 21:51.653
I'll make it work.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.653
Hey. Just one.

21:54.754 --> 21:57.232
Well, at least you don't have kids
and grandkids to worry about.

21:57.256 --> 21:58.471
Right.

22:10.470 --> 22:13.342
...Sunday, 8:00 p.m.
Temperatures 115 to 122...

22:21.780 --> 22:23.548
I don't wanna talk about it.

22:23.549 --> 22:25.885
Yeah? Neither do I, Brendan.

22:26.885 --> 22:27.885
What is this?

22:27.886 --> 22:29.019
I'll be home at 7:00.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.924
When I get back,
I want you gone.

22:33.924 --> 22:35.768
Dude, are you serious?

22:43.767 --> 22:46.870
Dude, what... Oh, my God.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.806
You boys been
beating me off with this scheme

22:50.807 --> 22:54.876
for the last three years, and the city
still hasn't made a damn dime yet.

22:54.877 --> 22:56.879
Huck, you saw the numbers.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.614
This crew, it's a real moneymaker
once they get certified.

23:00.615 --> 23:02.551
Well, when's that gonna be?

23:02.552 --> 23:05.520
As I understand it, they've done all
the time and obligations needed.

23:05.521 --> 23:08.055
This is the first city
to ever start its own crew,

23:08.056 --> 23:11.692
so the Feds see us as outsiders, like a
threat to their way of doing things.

23:11.693 --> 23:13.892
They're trying to put us off
by stalling our evaluation.

23:14.196 --> 23:14.740
That's right.

23:14.765 --> 23:16.162
Look, the people of Prescott

23:16.163 --> 23:19.167
don't understand why they're
paying for their own hotshot crew.

23:19.168 --> 23:21.669
And the city council, well,
they think it's overkill,

23:21.670 --> 23:24.072
like having a SEAL Team Six
do the job of a sheriff.

23:24.073 --> 23:27.177
The Rodeo Fire, it torched the rim above
Payson before they could get on it.

23:28.177 --> 23:30.444
The Indian Fire burned
right up to our doorstep.

23:30.445 --> 23:32.885
It's only a matter of time before
Prescott is gonna be dealing

23:33.247 --> 23:34.848
with a massive wildfire.

23:34.849 --> 23:35.849
That's right.

23:35.850 --> 23:36.850
And when it comes,

23:36.851 --> 23:39.585
the people living here, they're gonna be
thanking their bold, long-sighted mayor

23:39.586 --> 23:42.421
that they've got their very
own SEAL Team Six of hotshots

23:42.422 --> 23:43.495
to put it down quick.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.762
Are the Rusty Pistols gonna
play at the rodeo this year?

23:49.763 --> 23:52.732
Oh! Wouldn't have it
any other way.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.933
Are you gonna ride that big old
mule of yours to the show?

23:54.934 --> 23:55.647
Oh, shit, yeah.

24:00.407 --> 24:04.007
You got to the end of the season to
get yourself evaluated and certified.

24:04.008 --> 24:06.043
And you got next season
to prove your worth.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.881
But it's all on you, Duane.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.448
Appreciate this, Mayor.

24:11.449 --> 24:12.545
You will not regret this, sir.

24:12.569 --> 24:13.384
Well, I hope not.

24:13.385 --> 24:16.122
Now, you boys
keep your powder dry.

24:17.122 --> 24:17.715
Thank you.

24:17.740 --> 24:19.517
Hey, Dave. Good to see you.

24:22.493 --> 24:25.829
That's our mayor.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.664
Hey, Brendan.

24:27.665 --> 24:30.767
Your daughter Michaela was born
six minutes ago. Congrats.

24:30.768 --> 24:32.402
She's totally healthy?

24:32.403 --> 24:33.834
Nothing wrong with
her or nothing?

24:33.859 --> 24:34.858
No, she's perfect.

24:36.773 --> 24:38.273
How's the mom doing?

24:38.274 --> 24:39.809
She's all good.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.377
Now, listen, they're gonna put the
baby in the nursery in a little while

24:42.378 --> 24:43.780
so mom can rest.

24:43.781 --> 24:44.781
I'll come get you, okay?

24:45.214 --> 24:45.965
Yeah. All right.

24:45.990 --> 24:46.715
All right.

24:46.716 --> 24:47.378
Thanks, man.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.403
Yeah.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.529
Wade Scott Parker.

25:00.530 --> 25:03.498
So, your father's a captain
on Chino Valley Fire?

25:03.499 --> 25:04.053
Yes, sir.

25:04.078 --> 25:05.078
Huh.

25:06.668 --> 25:08.145
So I'm assuming you
know the difference

25:08.169 --> 25:10.169
between structure and
wildland fighting operations.

25:10.271 --> 25:11.439
I do.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.209
Um, wildland firefighters,
they dig line,

25:14.209 --> 25:17.810
they cut trees, light
backburns to corral the fire.

25:17.811 --> 25:18.811
They try to control it.

25:18.812 --> 25:19.814
Yep.

25:19.815 --> 25:21.785
We fight fire with fire.

25:23.784 --> 25:25.451
What does the word
"integrity" mean to you?

25:25.452 --> 25:27.787
For shit's sake, Jesse, can we
please get to the good questions?

25:27.788 --> 25:28.795
What? Okay.

25:33.795 --> 25:35.828
When was the last time you lied?

25:35.829 --> 25:38.199
Um, I... I guess
to my mom, this morning.

25:39.199 --> 25:40.865
About what?

25:40.866 --> 25:43.768
I told her that this job isn't as
dangerous as working structure.

25:43.769 --> 25:45.637
Are you lying to me right now?

25:45.638 --> 25:46.971
No, sir.

25:46.972 --> 25:48.472
You a short-timer?

25:48.473 --> 25:49.507
A what, sir?

25:49.508 --> 25:51.343
A firefighter's son
looking to use my crew

25:51.344 --> 25:53.945
as a stepping stone to a gig
on the structure side.

25:53.946 --> 25:54.363
No, sir.

25:54.388 --> 25:55.613
Now, you'd better not be,

25:55.614 --> 25:57.881
'cause if there's one thing
I can't stand, it's that.

25:57.882 --> 25:58.882
Yes, sir.

26:01.519 --> 26:02.519
You got any running gear?

26:03.321 --> 26:04.321
I do, sir. In the car.

26:05.224 --> 26:07.458
All right, we're gonna go for a little
hike in a bit, me and the boys.

26:07.459 --> 26:08.939
Come along, we'll
give you a look-see.

26:09.593 --> 26:10.593
Thank you, sir.

26:15.265 --> 26:16.265
Why are you still here?

26:16.266 --> 26:17.945
Sorry, sir.

26:27.945 --> 26:29.512
I like him.

26:39.621 --> 26:40.621
Ah, nice shot!

26:41.225 --> 26:41.675
One point.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.024
One point for these guys.

27:15.727 --> 27:16.589
I don't know.

27:16.590 --> 27:17.596
Let's find out, shall we?

27:22.596 --> 27:23.596
Brian, right?

27:23.597 --> 27:24.663
It's Brendan.

27:24.664 --> 27:25.998
Right.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.400
You were in my EMT class.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.569
What's up? You...

27:30.569 --> 27:32.104
You lost, or...

27:32.105 --> 27:33.805
No, I was just checking.

27:33.806 --> 27:35.846
You know, I heard you guys
had some slots available.

27:42.447 --> 27:44.082
Slots are all filled, man.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.086
Sorry, dude.

27:47.086 --> 27:48.586
All right. Thanks, man.

27:48.587 --> 27:49.921
Yeah.

27:49.922 --> 27:51.287
Hey.

27:51.288 --> 27:53.826
We got one slot open.
You want to interview for it?

27:54.826 --> 27:55.826
Yeah. Right now?

27:56.661 --> 27:58.096
Yeah, right now.

27:59.096 --> 28:00.938
All right.

28:06.937 --> 28:09.272
I'm Eric Marsh,
superintendent of Crew 7.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.352
Brendan McDonough.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.825
When was the last time you used?

28:28.825 --> 28:30.361
Don't think, just
answer the question.

28:32.361 --> 28:33.900
Three months ago.

28:36.900 --> 28:37.969
Ever use needles?

28:37.994 --> 28:38.994
No.

28:39.534 --> 28:40.534
Never.

28:46.874 --> 28:48.545
Do you have your qualifications?

28:49.545 --> 28:51.111
Yeah. Uh...

28:51.112 --> 28:55.849
Wildland fire, fire science,
and just completed my EMT.

28:55.850 --> 28:59.386
You know the difference between
Type 2 crew and Type 1 IHC?

28:59.387 --> 29:01.320
Yes, sir. Hotshots are
on the front line,

29:01.321 --> 29:02.921
and they get to
engage the fire directly.

29:04.726 --> 29:05.726
Good.

29:08.696 --> 29:09.696
You got a record?

29:11.198 --> 29:12.497
Yeah.

29:12.498 --> 29:13.498
- Felony larceny.
- Hmm.

29:15.368 --> 29:16.368
You ever do any time?

29:18.205 --> 29:19.705
Three days.

29:19.706 --> 29:22.914
And I'm on probation right now.

29:27.914 --> 29:29.451
What are you doing here?

29:32.451 --> 29:35.086
I made a lot of
mistakes in my life,

29:35.087 --> 29:38.022
and I've done a lot of things
that I'm ashamed of

29:38.023 --> 29:41.596
and I'm embarrassed by,
honestly, but...

29:43.596 --> 29:45.761
I just had a daughter...

29:45.762 --> 29:47.933
Her name's Michaela

29:48.933 --> 29:51.206
and I just really wanna
give her what I never had.

29:56.206 --> 29:58.454
If you give me a chance,
I won't let you down.

30:10.453 --> 30:12.090
Okay.

30:14.090 --> 30:16.892
All right. The crew's
gonna go on a little hike.

30:16.893 --> 30:18.559
You got any running gear?

30:18.560 --> 30:19.928
Uh... No.

30:19.929 --> 30:21.295
What size shoe do you wear?

30:21.296 --> 30:22.296
Ten.

30:22.297 --> 30:23.568
Hand 'em over.

30:25.568 --> 30:26.928
They're... They're
brand-new, Supe.

30:27.168 --> 30:29.136
Yeah, I don't give a shit.
Hand 'em over.

30:29.137 --> 30:30.808
McDonough!

30:32.808 --> 30:33.807
Come on.

30:37.445 --> 30:38.778
Come on.

30:38.779 --> 30:40.815
They're... They're
limited edition, sir.

30:40.816 --> 30:41.816
Yeah? Okay.

30:42.150 --> 30:43.986
There you go.

30:44.986 --> 30:46.825
Thanks, man.

30:50.824 --> 30:51.959
Are those limited edition?

30:51.983 --> 30:52.392
Shut up.

31:09.007 --> 31:10.287
What's up with that Brendan kid?

31:11.143 --> 31:13.084
You're not serious
about him, are you?

31:13.109 --> 31:14.079
It's up to him.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.149
This kid's a train wreck.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.682
Mack was in his EMT class,
said he's into dope.

31:18.683 --> 31:21.420
I'm talking hard shit.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.140
What you doing, Supe? We're trying
to get certified as hotshots here.

31:36.468 --> 31:39.236
All you rookies that are
just coming on as slot contenders,

31:40.236 --> 31:42.874
I want you all to breathe in
this beautiful vista.

31:44.874 --> 31:46.843
Breathe it in deeply.

31:47.843 --> 31:50.513
'Cause after you all
get baptized,

31:50.514 --> 31:54.886
you're never gonna be able to look out into
the wilds and see that pure beauty again.

31:55.885 --> 31:59.223
Once you get a real hard taste
of the bitch at work,

32:00.223 --> 32:02.492
there's only one thing
you're gonna be able to see,

32:03.492 --> 32:04.492
and that's fuel.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.733
So think about that.

32:10.733 --> 32:12.901
Meditate on it.

32:13.901 --> 32:15.261
Then decide if this job
is for you.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.041
Line it out!

32:21.066 --> 32:22.009
Line it out!

32:22.010 --> 32:23.431
Come on, guys, line it out.

32:23.456 --> 32:24.456
Line it out!

32:25.379 --> 32:26.379
Line it out!

33:02.580 --> 33:04.515
You think he dropped
dead on the trail?

33:04.516 --> 33:06.683
Definite possibility.

33:06.684 --> 33:09.687
If that shit stain died in my new
kicks, I'm gonna kill him, Supe.

33:11.723 --> 33:12.759
Oh, well.

33:13.759 --> 33:14.759
- Hey, Supe.
- What?

33:15.227 --> 33:16.460
Check it out.

33:16.461 --> 33:17.460
What?

33:25.470 --> 33:26.470
Oh, my Lord.

33:26.471 --> 33:27.518
Uh-huh.

33:45.975 --> 33:46.956
All right.

33:46.957 --> 33:48.574
See you 6:00 a.m., Monday.

34:07.409 --> 34:08.676
You all right?

34:09.676 --> 34:10.676
Yeah.

34:10.677 --> 34:12.043
Yeah? Can you drive?

34:12.045 --> 34:12.639
Yeah.

34:12.665 --> 34:13.947
Okay.

34:13.949 --> 34:16.983
Pound tons of electrolytes, take
some Motrin, get some sleep, buddy.

34:16.984 --> 34:18.751
You'll be all right.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.853
Hey, I got your kicks.

34:20.855 --> 34:23.126
You owe me a hundred bucks.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.587
Duane saw it headed this way.

34:57.588 --> 35:00.695
Thought it looked lost,
too young to be on its own.

35:03.695 --> 35:06.064
She came through here.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.135
Who dumps a young horse
here to die?

35:10.135 --> 35:11.734
Like it was nothing.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.070
Well, we'll find her.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.571
That way.

35:15.572 --> 35:16.882
Let's go.

35:46.201 --> 35:47.935
Ten minutes!

35:47.936 --> 35:49.736
Come on, 10 minutes, shitbirds!

35:49.737 --> 35:53.374
Hey, let's go, Bravo! Let's go, Bravo!
Kick it up, max level!

35:53.375 --> 35:55.743
You don't wanna be buying
Alpha's rounds all night!

35:55.744 --> 35:57.111
Come on!

35:57.112 --> 35:58.779
Norris, pop quiz.

35:58.780 --> 36:01.280
You're cutting a line on a
side hill below the fire.

36:01.281 --> 36:04.550
Debris and logs could start to roll down
and cross your line. What do you do?

36:04.551 --> 36:08.088
Build a cup trench and move the logs
so they're up and down the slope.

36:08.089 --> 36:10.356
There it is. Outstanding.

36:10.357 --> 36:12.760
Hey, McDonough, pop quiz.

36:12.761 --> 36:15.695
What's your 11th watch-out?

36:15.696 --> 36:18.429
No, don't look at him. Look at me.
What's your 11th watch-out?

36:18.430 --> 36:20.565
The fire line you're cutting
hasn't been anchored.

36:20.566 --> 36:23.067
Wrong.
That's the 8th.

36:23.068 --> 36:24.542
You're getting
spot fires across...

36:24.567 --> 36:25.567
That's 16th!

36:26.238 --> 36:27.973
Alpha Squad, hold!

36:27.974 --> 36:29.875
What's your 11th watch-out?

36:29.876 --> 36:32.611
Unburned fuel
between you and the fire.

36:32.612 --> 36:35.847
Firefighters died for us so we
could learn all these watch-outs.

36:35.848 --> 36:38.518
If you get another one wrong,
I will choke you out.

36:39.518 --> 36:40.785
Yes, sir.

36:40.786 --> 36:43.123
Alpha Squad,
hundred off the deck. Now!

36:45.124 --> 36:46.858
My bad, guys.

36:47.921 --> 36:48.921
Let's go, Bravo!

36:51.829 --> 36:54.263
Hey, McDipshit,
can you get any more challenged?

36:54.264 --> 36:56.933
You got dick right
since you've been here.

36:56.934 --> 36:58.268
Zero.

36:58.269 --> 36:59.269
Goddamn donut.

36:59.270 --> 37:00.536
McDonut.

37:02.939 --> 37:06.975
I know you're doing this for your
baby girl, but I don't know, dude.

37:06.976 --> 37:09.181
I've heard some shit
about her mama.

37:11.181 --> 37:12.581
You sure that kid's
even yours, bro?

37:14.150 --> 37:15.785
Whoa!

37:15.786 --> 37:16.786
McDonough!

37:17.121 --> 37:18.854
Do it. Throw that punch.

37:18.855 --> 37:20.689
Do it. Come on.

37:20.690 --> 37:21.690
Do it.

37:21.691 --> 37:22.961
Quit on yourself.

37:24.961 --> 37:26.167
Go home. Die.

37:34.970 --> 37:37.508
All right, Bravo,
get back to work!

37:39.507 --> 37:41.374
That was way out of line, Mack.

37:41.375 --> 37:44.313
I don't mind you sweating the rooks,
but you don't bring in family.

37:45.313 --> 37:46.313
You hear me?

37:50.217 --> 37:52.752
Crew 7,
keep it moving, keep it moving!

37:52.753 --> 37:53.753
Deploy! Deploy!

37:53.754 --> 37:55.021
Deploy!

37:55.022 --> 37:57.657
Rookies on the inside!
Flames over that way!

37:57.658 --> 37:59.227
Feet to the flames,
feet to the flames!

38:00.227 --> 38:01.427
Go, go, go!

38:01.428 --> 38:02.896
Bottles and radios
in the shelter!

38:02.897 --> 38:03.897
Let's go, let's go! Move!

38:03.898 --> 38:05.063
Get rid of your tools!

38:05.064 --> 38:06.069
Go, go, go! Hurry it up!

38:06.094 --> 38:07.366
Boys, let's go, let's go!

38:07.367 --> 38:09.702
Come on, speed it up!
Fire's chasing us!

38:09.703 --> 38:10.703
Move it, rookie, come on!

38:10.704 --> 38:12.037
Go, go, go, go!

38:12.038 --> 38:12.649
Seven, six...

38:12.674 --> 38:13.872
Everybody in!

38:13.873 --> 38:18.246
Five, four, three, two, one!

38:21.246 --> 38:22.583
All right, listen up.

38:23.583 --> 38:24.583
Burnover is seconds away,

38:25.184 --> 38:28.018
and it sounds like a hundred freight
trains right on top of you.

38:28.756 --> 38:30.180
The wind ripping
like a hurricane,

38:31.156 --> 38:32.656
heat coming on
1,000 plus degrees.

38:34.325 --> 38:35.860
It's the apocalypse.

38:35.861 --> 38:37.494
And remember,

38:37.495 --> 38:40.063
stay locked down, bury your
face in that cool dirt,

38:40.064 --> 38:42.599
'cause as long as you can
breathe, you can survive.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.399
When this thing
finally sweeps over you,

38:44.400 --> 38:46.803
it's gonna feel like
the end of the world.

38:46.804 --> 38:48.739
No matter what you hear,

38:48.740 --> 38:50.774
no matter what's going on...

38:50.775 --> 38:51.775
What the...

38:53.411 --> 38:54.096
Who's in there?

38:54.121 --> 38:55.170
Rose. Rose.

38:56.146 --> 38:58.281
Is that your sock
next to your shelter?

38:58.282 --> 38:59.782
What?

38:59.783 --> 39:01.617
That's Rosie's
beat-off sock, sir.

39:05.489 --> 39:07.722
I asked you a question.

39:07.723 --> 39:09.959
No, it's definitely not my sock, sir.
I don't...

39:09.960 --> 39:11.459
Then why is your name
written on it?

39:11.460 --> 39:13.095
'Cause it's his sock, sir.

39:15.931 --> 39:17.966
Mack, out of the shelter!

39:17.967 --> 39:19.567
I don't wanna come out, Steed.

39:19.568 --> 39:22.469
I don't blame you.
Get out of the shelter, MacKenzie!

39:22.470 --> 39:25.473
Come on, California boy!
Come on up!

39:25.474 --> 39:26.474
Stand up.

39:26.475 --> 39:27.808
You're such an asshole.

39:29.278 --> 39:31.245
Do you think this is funny?

39:31.246 --> 39:32.446
I wear anklets.

39:33.647 --> 39:34.268
Ankle socks.

39:34.293 --> 39:35.615
Is he a joke to you?

39:35.616 --> 39:36.816
Yeah.

39:38.286 --> 39:38.874
Hi, this is Marsh.

39:38.899 --> 39:39.986
What's up?

39:39.987 --> 39:41.267
Just running a deployment drill.

39:42.156 --> 39:43.656
What you got?

39:43.657 --> 39:45.825
New start in the
Chiricahua Mountains.

39:45.826 --> 39:48.262
Ate up 9,000 acres
since yesterday.

39:48.263 --> 39:50.932
They ordered up
a Type 2 ICS team.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.100
So, mount up.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.436
This is it, Eric, game time.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.938
What do you mean?

39:58.939 --> 40:01.806
I called in a favor
with an IC that owes me.

40:01.807 --> 40:02.807
Hayes.

40:04.211 --> 40:06.813
You're being evaluated.

40:07.813 --> 40:09.181
I'll hit you with the details.

40:10.181 --> 40:11.983
Good luck.

40:11.984 --> 40:13.121
Okay, got it.

40:16.121 --> 40:18.491
I feel like your mother.
You're my second-favorite son.

40:19.491 --> 40:21.627
All right, gather up!

40:23.627 --> 40:24.930
Got some news.

40:25.930 --> 40:27.998
We're heading to
a fire down south.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.632
And we're getting
our eval on it.

40:32.102 --> 40:34.142
Settle down, settle down.
Remember, when we do this,

40:36.140 --> 40:37.376
act like we've done it before.

40:47.016 --> 40:49.084
Hey, Ryder.

40:49.085 --> 40:51.687
Hey, I'm sorry I'm missing
your birthday again, buster.

40:51.688 --> 40:52.921
But you know what?

40:52.922 --> 40:54.755
We're having a second party
when I get back.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.257
It's gonna be even better, okay?

40:56.258 --> 40:58.394
"Good night, stars.
Good night, air.

40:58.395 --> 41:00.996
"Good night, noises everywhere."

41:00.997 --> 41:03.401
When I come home a hotshot,
what are you gonna do?

41:05.401 --> 41:07.521
Babe, babe, I just...
I just need a little motivation.

41:08.171 --> 41:11.206
I mean, give me something deep,
give me something nasty to think about.

41:12.206 --> 41:14.644
Ooh, I like it. Mmm.

41:15.644 --> 41:16.644
You got to go?

41:17.211 --> 41:18.879
Okay.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.018
Okay, bye.

41:23.018 --> 41:24.487
Donut.

41:26.854 --> 41:27.854
Rookie.

41:28.756 --> 41:30.993
My girl, Cheyanne.

41:31.993 --> 41:32.993
Nice.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.695
Nice?

41:34.696 --> 41:36.530
I mean, that is a world-beating
piece of ass right there.

41:36.531 --> 41:39.264
Look at those superstar
titties of hers.

41:39.265 --> 41:42.702
I mean, if we get certified as hotshots,
she's gonna do things to me.

41:42.703 --> 41:43.702
Do you understand?

41:46.405 --> 41:48.409
Hey, bring it in.

41:50.409 --> 41:51.909
Bring it in.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.914
Come on, just nice and tight.

41:54.914 --> 41:56.915
I hope you do understand,

41:56.916 --> 42:00.718
because we've been working to get this
eval for over four years now, bro.

42:00.719 --> 42:04.322
And a lot can happen to a little
puke like you out on the line.

42:04.323 --> 42:09.459
And if you do anything, I mean anything,
to mess our shit up,

42:09.460 --> 42:11.140
something's definitely
gonna happen to you.

42:17.133 --> 42:18.936
Okay, good chat.

42:31.615 --> 42:35.484
Look at you, looking like a cat
eating shit out of a hairbrush.

42:35.485 --> 42:36.485
This is it, Papa.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.821
We're gonna crush this eval.

42:38.822 --> 42:41.557
Yeah, let's just do what we do.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.626
Weather's working
against us right now.

42:43.627 --> 42:46.130
Wind's gusting to 20
and the humidity is dropping.

42:47.130 --> 42:49.029
Fire's got two heads
at the moment.

42:49.030 --> 42:54.634
Hotshot crews in Division Echo will
look at cutting direct line here.

42:54.635 --> 42:58.505
Division Alpha will build
an indirect line here.

42:58.506 --> 43:00.176
Now, that line
is our trigger point.

43:01.176 --> 43:05.513
If the fire crosses it, we'll look
at evacuating the city of Portal,

43:05.514 --> 43:07.881
five miles to the northeast.

43:07.882 --> 43:10.015
Good luck. Be careful.

43:17.291 --> 43:18.627
Are you Marsh?

43:19.627 --> 43:21.460
Yes, sir, Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

43:21.461 --> 43:22.461
Hayes.

43:22.462 --> 43:23.963
Oh, pleasure, sir.

43:23.964 --> 43:25.864
- My captain, Jesse Steed.
- Nice to meet you.

43:25.865 --> 43:27.800
All right. So,
what are we doing?

43:27.801 --> 43:29.969
Oh, well, it looks like
we're in Division Alpha.

43:29.970 --> 43:32.271
We're gonna cut a line along the
base of this hill right there.

43:32.272 --> 43:35.373
Yeah, there's no direct access
there, so we'll helo in, spike out.

43:35.374 --> 43:37.998
All right, well,
let's see what you boys got.

44:07.105 --> 44:08.707
Whoa!

44:09.707 --> 44:12.007
Hey, don't puke, you pukes.

44:20.217 --> 44:21.350
All right.

44:46.274 --> 44:47.776
Bravo Squad!

44:48.776 --> 44:51.715
Bravo Squad,
watch that slope there!

44:53.715 --> 44:55.482
Jesse, where you at?

44:55.483 --> 44:58.752
Scouting two ridges over.
Got brands coming in, spot fires.

44:58.753 --> 45:01.321
Nothing crazy, but she's
definitely headed our way.

45:01.322 --> 45:03.199
All right, why don't you work
your way back down to the crew?

45:03.223 --> 45:04.223
I'm gonna go scout ahead.

45:04.224 --> 45:05.492
Copy that.

45:05.493 --> 45:07.426
You got a high-speed,
low-drag crew,

45:07.427 --> 45:09.595
but how long can you
run them at that pace?

45:09.596 --> 45:10.636
Well, as long as it takes.

45:11.132 --> 45:13.733
Bad cut!
Tree coming down!

45:13.734 --> 45:15.138
- Falling!
- Falling!

45:24.109 --> 45:25.476
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

45:25.477 --> 45:28.279
You got a spot
weather forecast for me?

45:28.280 --> 45:30.192
We have a storm
cell kicking up from the south.

45:30.216 --> 45:33.484
High wind advisory.
25 to 30 miles per hour.

45:33.485 --> 45:35.791
All right, copy that.
Thank you.

45:38.791 --> 45:40.259
Want a piece of my Carolina ass?

45:42.259 --> 45:44.060
Come and get it.

45:47.132 --> 45:49.065
Fire's making a run
toward our line.

45:49.066 --> 45:51.934
By the time she gets here, she's
gonna be too strong to hold.

45:51.935 --> 45:54.575
It's gonna crown that ridge, spot
over, and run straight into town.

45:55.173 --> 45:56.873
If we backburn
this side of the mountain,

45:56.874 --> 45:59.710
by the time bitch comes over,
she'll have no fuel to feed into.

45:59.711 --> 46:01.978
That's a god-awful idea.

46:01.979 --> 46:03.947
All the conditions
favor the fire,

46:03.948 --> 46:05.881
and when that blaze
comes down that mountain,

46:05.882 --> 46:08.884
it's gonna kick your ass and use
your burn to get even stronger.

46:08.885 --> 46:10.620
We won't be able to stop it.

46:10.621 --> 46:12.888
Okay, well, our line's not gonna
hold unless we burn it off.

46:12.889 --> 46:14.290
But it'll slow it down,

46:14.291 --> 46:16.526
maybe give us a chance to
get other resources up here.

46:16.527 --> 46:17.893
Okay, what you don't
understand, sir...

46:17.894 --> 46:21.996
Well, what you don't
understand is 40 years, son.

46:21.997 --> 46:25.032
I was on the job when you
were still shitting yellow.

46:25.033 --> 46:28.336
So, if you think you're gonna
make a big move and impress me,

46:28.337 --> 46:30.539
I'm telling you
right now, don't.

46:30.540 --> 46:32.807
Due respect,
you're just an observer.

46:32.808 --> 46:33.888
So let us do our job, okay?

46:34.176 --> 46:35.777
- No, you're not a...
- No, no, step off!

46:35.778 --> 46:37.358
Now. Step off.

46:51.358 --> 46:52.499
Damn.

46:57.498 --> 46:59.201
What's y'all's comfort level?

47:00.201 --> 47:01.428
Are you down for the cause?

47:01.453 --> 47:02.836
Let's get after it, then.

47:02.837 --> 47:03.678
Get some.

47:03.703 --> 47:04.729
Boss.

47:05.705 --> 47:07.944
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

47:18.718 --> 47:20.554
Is that a rosary?

47:21.554 --> 47:23.688
No, prayer beads.

47:23.689 --> 47:25.457
Buddhist, huh?

47:25.458 --> 47:29.358
Well, this thing goes sideways,
nothing's gonna save you.

47:29.359 --> 47:30.496
Not even Buddha.

47:32.496 --> 47:34.298
Holy shit, dude.

47:34.299 --> 47:35.999
Can't believe we're about to light
up a couple thousand acres.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.934
Chill, bro, this is what we do.

47:37.935 --> 47:40.148
Once you light that fuse, you throw
it deep into the fire, all right?

47:40.172 --> 47:41.372
Yeah, cool.

47:41.373 --> 47:43.406
Mack, Steed.

47:43.407 --> 47:45.674
Putting fuel on the ground now.
Make sure you stay ahead of us.

47:45.675 --> 47:46.675
Copy that.

47:47.211 --> 47:48.251
Here we go.

48:04.293 --> 48:06.833
Nice. All right, uno más.

48:09.833 --> 48:10.846
Hey, you all right?

48:10.871 --> 48:11.432
Shit.

48:13.802 --> 48:14.705
Dude, shit, go.

48:14.730 --> 48:15.668
Bees, man.

48:15.669 --> 48:16.599
Bro, run. Bro, go.

48:16.624 --> 48:17.271
Go! Go!

48:17.272 --> 48:19.072
Run! Bees! Bees, man!

48:19.073 --> 48:19.557
Oh, shit!

48:19.582 --> 48:21.007
They're stinging my balls!

48:24.278 --> 48:25.646
Who said that?

48:25.647 --> 48:27.917
Oh, dude, karma's a
bitch, ain't it, Mack?

48:31.751 --> 48:32.703
Rose.

48:32.728 --> 48:33.654
What?

48:33.655 --> 48:35.821
That went in my asshole.

48:35.822 --> 48:36.297
Jesus.

48:36.322 --> 48:37.417
You ever read the Bible?

48:40.393 --> 48:42.261
Yeah. I mean,
not like you, but...

48:42.262 --> 48:43.497
Yeah, it's good.

48:54.973 --> 48:56.276
Well, that worked.

48:57.276 --> 48:58.396
No matter what Hayes thinks.

48:59.345 --> 49:00.883
Mmm-hmm.

49:02.883 --> 49:04.798
Get some sleep, Papa.

49:52.496 --> 49:54.829
It's for my boy, Ryder.
I bring him home a rock...

49:54.830 --> 49:55.216
Snag!

49:55.241 --> 49:56.064
Shit!

49:58.301 --> 50:00.002
Holy shit!

50:01.002 --> 50:02.704
Everybody okay?

50:02.705 --> 50:03.745
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we're okay.

50:04.073 --> 50:05.740
All right, keep it moving!

50:10.912 --> 50:11.912
Thanks, man.

50:25.260 --> 50:26.725
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?

50:26.726 --> 50:28.461
- Where's your chinstrap?
- My what?

50:28.462 --> 50:30.582
- Your chinny!
- You can't fly without a strap, Donut!

50:31.098 --> 50:32.307
Shit, I don't know.
I just had it, man.

50:32.331 --> 50:33.031
Hey, we got to run.

50:33.032 --> 50:34.632
I got no time for this.
Mack, set him up!

50:51.383 --> 50:52.884
Donut!

50:52.885 --> 50:53.885
Hey!

50:59.123 --> 50:59.824
I think this is yours!

51:09.333 --> 51:11.269
Hey.

51:11.270 --> 51:14.121
However this shakes out,
just know we saved all that.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.591
Jesse. Jesse, what...
What happened?

51:37.592 --> 51:39.761
Hey, hey, settle down,
Manda-bear. It's me.

51:39.762 --> 51:42.934
Oh, Jesus Christ, Eric.

51:45.235 --> 51:47.335
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

51:47.336 --> 51:49.138
I got my phone
smashed up this morning.

51:50.138 --> 51:51.258
So, you're on your way back?

51:52.174 --> 51:53.176
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

51:54.176 --> 51:55.176
How'd it go?

51:59.113 --> 52:00.193
I think I really messed up.

52:01.149 --> 52:02.950
What do you mean?
What happened?

52:02.951 --> 52:05.786
I called a play out on the line, and
I know it was the right thing to do

52:05.787 --> 52:07.687
and I'd do it again,

52:07.688 --> 52:11.025
but I think it's gonna cost us
our certification.

52:12.025 --> 52:13.496
I'm really sorry.

52:14.496 --> 52:15.898
Yeah.

52:17.898 --> 52:19.802
Well...

52:21.801 --> 52:23.468
I peed in my pants today.

52:23.469 --> 52:24.504
You...

52:25.504 --> 52:26.504
You what?

52:27.074 --> 52:28.840
I peed in my pants.

52:28.841 --> 52:30.376
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:30.377 --> 52:34.848
I was working with a colt
over at Sam Lapeer's ranch,

52:35.848 --> 52:37.082
and I had to go really bad,

52:38.082 --> 52:41.284
and the colt just reared up
and came down hard on my foot.

52:43.155 --> 52:44.688
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

52:44.689 --> 52:47.025
I'm fine except I
peed in my pants.

52:47.026 --> 52:49.226
- Did anybody see it?
- Everyone.

52:49.227 --> 52:50.227
They did?

52:50.228 --> 52:51.696
I felt like a jerk.

52:53.998 --> 52:56.633
And then I had to borrow pants
from Sam just to get home.

52:59.469 --> 53:01.472
Oh...

53:01.473 --> 53:03.207
You know how much I love you?

53:04.708 --> 53:06.868
Go back to sleep.
I'll see you in a little while, okay?

53:07.078 --> 53:07.528
Okay.

53:07.553 --> 53:08.879
Thank you for that.

53:08.880 --> 53:09.879
See you soon.

53:10.079 --> 53:11.242
- Night.
- Night-night.

53:46.013 --> 53:47.480
This is Marsh.

53:47.481 --> 53:48.882
Hey, Eric,
how did it go on the eval?

53:48.883 --> 53:50.018
Did you find out?
Do you know if you're good?

53:50.019 --> 53:51.518
- Dale.
- What?

53:51.519 --> 53:53.239
- I... I can't talk right now, Dale.
- What?

54:20.814 --> 54:21.814
God.

54:38.097 --> 54:39.931
Where is he?

54:39.932 --> 54:40.932
Office.

54:44.536 --> 54:45.536
Hey... Oh.

54:49.406 --> 54:50.777
Come in.

54:52.777 --> 54:54.010
God.

54:59.750 --> 55:01.520
What the hell
happened out there?

55:02.520 --> 55:04.155
I did what I thought was right.

55:06.155 --> 55:09.329
And the boys, man,
were they a sight to see.

55:16.298 --> 55:17.805
I've never been so proud.

55:29.911 --> 55:31.379
Deploy.

55:31.380 --> 55:32.113
I mean it. Deploy now!

55:32.138 --> 55:33.046
Let's go, boys!

55:33.047 --> 55:33.672
Move, move, move!

55:33.697 --> 55:34.481
Fire's that way!

55:34.482 --> 55:36.349
Come on, let's show
him how it's done.

55:36.350 --> 55:38.585
Hey, make some space, Rosie.
Come on, man.

55:38.586 --> 55:39.987
Face to the floor!

55:39.988 --> 55:41.348
Twenty bucks I beat you, Mack.

55:42.323 --> 55:43.991
Mack, what are you
doing? Hurry!

55:43.992 --> 55:46.893
Five, four, three...

55:46.894 --> 55:48.394
Come on, get down, get down!

55:48.395 --> 55:49.666
Two, one.

55:52.665 --> 55:53.668
Thirty-two seconds.

55:55.668 --> 55:57.509
That's very, very good.

56:01.509 --> 56:04.410
I know you boys had a
rough go of it out there,

56:04.411 --> 56:05.771
but if you're looking
for sympathy,

56:06.179 --> 56:09.547
the only place you're gonna
find it is in the dictionary,

56:09.548 --> 56:11.653
somewhere between
"shit" and "syphilis."

56:13.653 --> 56:15.423
All right, come on out.

56:18.423 --> 56:20.190
Here's the deal.

56:20.191 --> 56:22.192
I spoke with Hayes.

56:22.193 --> 56:26.029
He thinks your Supe here
is a real cocky sucker,

56:26.030 --> 56:31.103
but he thinks you all are one of the
best damn crews he's ever seen.

56:32.103 --> 56:34.471
Congratulations.

56:34.472 --> 56:35.368
You're hotshots.

56:41.445 --> 56:42.444
- Nice!
- Hell, yeah!

56:43.147 --> 56:43.707
Hotshots!

56:43.732 --> 56:44.732
Sweet!

56:50.453 --> 56:51.788
Ah, Woyjeck!

56:52.788 --> 56:54.356
All right, hey.

56:54.357 --> 56:55.925
We... We need a name.

56:55.926 --> 56:57.427
How about Thumb Butte Hotshots?

56:57.428 --> 56:58.427
Boo!

56:58.428 --> 56:59.896
I got it, I got it, I got it.

57:00.896 --> 57:01.896
The Firelords.

57:02.097 --> 57:02.564
No.

57:02.589 --> 57:03.964
Why not?

57:03.965 --> 57:05.019
That's the name
of your band, bro.

57:05.043 --> 57:05.866
Yeah, and we slay.

57:05.867 --> 57:08.035
Yeah, you slay,
in your mama's garage.

57:13.376 --> 57:14.477
Granite Mountain.

57:16.477 --> 57:17.477
Yeah.

57:18.413 --> 57:19.453
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

57:20.080 --> 57:20.968
There it is!

57:20.993 --> 57:21.782
Yeah.

57:21.783 --> 57:22.783
There it is.

57:32.860 --> 57:33.860
Hey.

57:34.427 --> 57:35.929
Hey.

57:35.930 --> 57:38.864
I appreciate you
making the effort.

57:38.865 --> 57:40.500
Leaving the stuff.

57:40.501 --> 57:42.271
Yeah, yeah. It's no problem.

57:43.271 --> 57:44.305
Wow.

57:45.305 --> 57:47.439
Wow, you look...

57:47.440 --> 57:49.320
Yeah, I know, I'm pretty filthy.
We were just...

57:50.109 --> 57:52.744
We were doing a fire down south.

57:52.745 --> 57:54.914
Chiricahua.

57:54.915 --> 57:58.584
Yeah, I heard that
you were working for Crew 7.

57:58.585 --> 58:01.519
Yeah, actually, we just...
We just got certified today as hotshots,

58:01.520 --> 58:05.489
so we're the
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

58:05.490 --> 58:07.160
That's amazing. Congrats.

58:13.164 --> 58:14.164
- She's so pretty.
- Yeah.

58:17.135 --> 58:18.338
Do you wanna hold her?

58:20.337 --> 58:22.039
Nah, I'm...

58:22.040 --> 58:25.876
You know, I'm so dirty.
I don't wanna mess up her clothes.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.812
It's okay, really. It's fine.

58:28.813 --> 58:29.406
Here. Yeah.

58:29.431 --> 58:31.209
Yeah, yeah, I'd love...
Yeah, please.

58:47.530 --> 58:48.332
Ooh, a little gas.

58:51.401 --> 58:52.667
She's so pretty.

58:52.668 --> 58:55.309
Yeah.
She looks like you.

59:01.309 --> 59:02.550
Nat...

59:08.549 --> 59:09.854
I'm sorry.

59:13.854 --> 59:14.861
It's okay.

59:19.861 --> 59:22.728
You ladies better listen up
and listen good.

59:22.729 --> 59:25.497
If there's one thing I know,
it's applesauce.

59:25.498 --> 59:26.738
Go ahead and try that, darling.

59:27.134 --> 59:28.602
Okay.

59:32.139 --> 59:33.139
That's right.

59:33.140 --> 59:34.806
Mmm.

59:34.807 --> 59:36.307
That's right. Yes, it is.

59:36.308 --> 59:37.377
That is good applesauce.

59:37.378 --> 59:39.377
Best dang applesauce
you ever had.

59:39.378 --> 59:40.980
Okay, it was cute at first.

59:40.981 --> 59:42.246
Now I just wanna scream.

59:42.247 --> 59:43.581
Is that yours and that's him?

59:43.582 --> 59:44.662
- That's both.
- That was...

59:45.084 --> 59:45.730
And who's that? Is that his?

59:45.755 --> 59:46.755
This is the one we lost.

59:50.422 --> 59:52.742
That's yours. Okay, keep that
away from the kid. Make sure.

59:53.091 --> 59:54.091
I'm gonna get some water.

59:54.092 --> 59:55.260
What? Okay.

59:55.261 --> 59:57.064
Smoking is over for you.
It's over.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.429
Sound familiar?

01:00:05.204 --> 01:00:07.106
You got that...
Stay still, stay still.

01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:10.985
Wait a minute. I'll wipe...
I'll wipe that off for you.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.385
You must be Brendan.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:23.886
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:25.287
I'm Amanda, Eric's wife.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.288
Oh, so nice to meet you.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.657
I've heard a lot about you.

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:28.658
How's it going?

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:29.925
It's good.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.425
Yeah?

01:00:31.426 --> 01:00:32.527
Yeah. I...

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.328
You know, I really
appreciate the opportunity.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:36.998
And...

01:00:36.999 --> 01:00:39.333
I really respect
your husband a lot.

01:00:39.334 --> 01:00:42.173
So, I hope to be
more like him someday.

01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:47.043
You guys have more in common
than you think.

01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.644
Hang in there.

01:00:50.645 --> 01:00:51.815
Thanks.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.815
Where are you taking me?

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:55.471
I want to show you something.

01:00:55.496 --> 01:00:56.496
All right.

01:00:58.219 --> 01:00:59.454
What?

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:02.222
For me?

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.048
You gonna take care of this one?

01:01:04.073 --> 01:01:04.657
Yeah.

01:01:04.658 --> 01:01:05.928
God.

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:25.172
- What's up, Mack?
- What up?

01:01:28.148 --> 01:01:29.817
Everything all right?

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:32.159
No, dude, far from it.

01:01:39.158 --> 01:01:41.259
Anything you wanna talk about?

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.030
Um... You remember
my gal Cheyanne, right?

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:46.030
Yeah.

01:01:46.031 --> 01:01:47.231
Yeah, well, I came home

01:01:47.232 --> 01:01:50.001
and found the slut
had been cheating on me.

01:01:52.036 --> 01:01:53.337
- Right?
- Really?

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:54.872
But you know what the kicker is?

01:01:54.873 --> 01:01:59.744
The kicker is she's banging
some dude on Flagstaff PD.

01:02:00.744 --> 01:02:02.513
Yeah.

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:04.647
I mean, whatever, you know.

01:02:04.648 --> 01:02:05.881
Whatever.

01:02:05.882 --> 01:02:07.584
I mean, what I got to find

01:02:07.585 --> 01:02:11.890
is a new place, 'cause I moved out
of our apartment into my car.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:13.890
Bitch.

01:02:18.095 --> 01:02:20.433
I mean, hey,
I got an extra room.

01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:24.433
Seriously?

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.372
Yeah.

01:02:30.373 --> 01:02:31.842
You know, if you need a...

01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:34.082
Spot to crash for a little bit.

01:02:39.081 --> 01:02:40.318
Right on, dude.

01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:46.621
Man, I just got to kick out my
buddy from the Flagstaff PD.

01:02:46.622 --> 01:02:47.622
He...

01:02:48.256 --> 01:02:49.722
Oh, funny guy.

01:02:49.723 --> 01:02:51.627
Yeah, his name...
His name's... His name's Dave.

01:02:52.627 --> 01:02:53.627
Man, I'll tell you,

01:02:55.295 --> 01:02:58.630
as true as I'm standing here
and as strange as this is,

01:02:58.631 --> 01:02:59.243
I'm happy.

01:03:00.468 --> 01:03:02.734
I'm happy and
grateful to everyone,

01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:04.938
the families, my crew,

01:03:04.939 --> 01:03:07.272
Duane, Amanda.

01:03:07.273 --> 01:03:08.741
You know, Granite Mountain

01:03:08.742 --> 01:03:12.277
is the first municipal hotshot
crew in this entire country.

01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:16.581
Can you believe that?
That's saying something.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.517
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,

01:03:19.518 --> 01:03:21.986
this first season as hotshots
is gonna be tough.

01:03:21.987 --> 01:03:24.222
We're gonna be traveling
all over the country.

01:03:24.223 --> 01:03:25.943
We're gonna be working harder,
going longer,

01:03:26.092 --> 01:03:30.293
so it's important that this Granite
Mountain family pulls together

01:03:30.294 --> 01:03:32.262
and looks out for each other.

01:03:32.263 --> 01:03:34.331
'Cause we can't do this
without your support.

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:35.834
That's right.

01:03:36.834 --> 01:03:38.338
Esse quam videri.

01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:42.840
"To be, rather than to seem."

01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:45.479
And everybody here
has lived up to this creed.

01:03:47.478 --> 01:03:50.148
No Supe could be prouder,

01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:54.886
right now, of his boys
than I am of you guys.

01:03:55.886 --> 01:03:58.722
So, to commemorate
this occasion,

01:03:58.723 --> 01:04:00.390
I had some tees made up.

01:04:01.491 --> 01:04:03.224
All right?

01:04:03.225 --> 01:04:05.726
Now, you can only wear them
if you're a hotshot.

01:04:05.727 --> 01:04:07.695
Right?

01:04:07.696 --> 01:04:10.498
Okay, so it's sleeping
with a hotshot, too, okay?

01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:13.468
There you go.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.680
Oh!

01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:29.052
There she is, little Michaela.

01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:31.292
You want to show Mack your dog?

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:33.854
Your dad and
Uncle Mack are stoked

01:04:33.855 --> 01:04:36.389
you're having your
first sleepover with us.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.890
She's got a puppy...

01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:39.592
Dude, what did you do?

01:04:39.593 --> 01:04:42.695
I, uh,
baby-proofed everything,

01:04:42.696 --> 01:04:45.733
like the bathroom cabinets,
the kitchen, the whole house, basically.

01:04:45.734 --> 01:04:47.234
So, we're good.

01:04:47.235 --> 01:04:48.869
That's awesome, man.
Thank you.

01:04:50.037 --> 01:04:51.442
Aw, why not?

01:04:56.441 --> 01:04:57.441
She loves this dog, man.

01:04:57.442 --> 01:04:59.014
Yeah.

01:05:01.014 --> 01:05:03.381
Family, bro.

01:05:03.894 --> 01:05:05.283
Let's get the bunny, huh?

01:05:05.284 --> 01:05:06.618
You like the bunny.

01:05:06.619 --> 01:05:08.552
Yeah, he's a friend.

01:05:08.553 --> 01:05:09.038
Hello.

01:05:09.063 --> 01:05:10.515
Dude, what took you so long?

01:05:13.491 --> 01:05:14.991
She's, like,
she's really hot, man.

01:05:14.992 --> 01:05:16.260
How's she doing?

01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:17.261
She's, like, burning up.

01:05:17.262 --> 01:05:18.364
Oh, God.

01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:21.666
I know. I know. It's okay.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.667
This is your friend.
She's your friend.

01:05:24.668 --> 01:05:26.168
Hey, bro. The other way.

01:05:26.169 --> 01:05:27.904
Okay.

01:05:27.905 --> 01:05:29.405
The other end. No.

01:05:29.406 --> 01:05:30.610
This?

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:34.610
What?

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:39.449
One hundred and three
point four! Dude!

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.548
No bueno, man.

01:05:42.085 --> 01:05:43.085
Call a pediatrician, man.

01:05:43.086 --> 01:05:44.820
I called him like five times.

01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:45.478
He's not picking up.

01:05:45.503 --> 01:05:46.923
What do you mean,
he hasn't picked up?

01:05:46.924 --> 01:05:47.541
I don't know, he's
being an asshole!

01:05:47.566 --> 01:05:48.687
We gotta go to the hospital.

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:50.127
Yeah, right, man.

01:05:51.127 --> 01:05:52.595
It's my first night alone with her.
Natalie will never let me see her again.

01:05:52.596 --> 01:05:54.229
Yeah, you're right.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.998
Turbyfill! His wife, Stephanie!
I think she's a nurse.

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:03.237
Hey, how's she doing?

01:06:03.238 --> 01:06:05.718
Her temperature's coming down.
Her coloring's good. She's fine.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:07.909
Yeah, she's good?

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:12.380
Infants burn high fevers sometimes.
It's totally normal. Yeah.

01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:17.618
All right. Good. Thank you.

01:06:17.619 --> 01:06:19.954
Yeah, I didn't know that's
how you took a temperature.

01:06:19.955 --> 01:06:21.731
All right, men. I
think we're good.

01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:22.323
Whew!

01:06:22.324 --> 01:06:24.324
She's, uh...
Yeah, she's happy, so...

01:06:24.325 --> 01:06:26.294
Good, man.

01:06:26.295 --> 01:06:27.729
Yeah.

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.829
I really appreciate
you guys coming by.

01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:32.230
Ah...

01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:34.601
It's what we're here for, bro.

01:06:34.602 --> 01:06:36.902
Man, like, I've been through
some pretty crazy, intense shit,

01:06:36.903 --> 01:06:40.273
but that was, hands down,
the scariest thing of my life.

01:06:41.408 --> 01:06:42.408
Seriously.

01:06:43.944 --> 01:06:45.344
Welcome to fatherhood, dude.

01:06:45.345 --> 01:06:48.180
Yeah, I'm gonna pump
the brakes on having kids.

01:06:52.117 --> 01:06:55.888
Just the thought of fire
season starting makes me lonely.

01:06:55.889 --> 01:06:59.457
Well, once this crew proves
itself this first season,

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:01.630
we'll be able to
slow down a little bit.

01:07:05.629 --> 01:07:09.135
You know, the other wives,
they always say,

01:07:10.135 --> 01:07:12.575
"At least you don't have kids.
It's so much harder with kids."

01:07:13.138 --> 01:07:15.808
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:07:16.808 --> 01:07:19.676
It's starting to
get under my skin.

01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:21.115
Really? Why?

01:07:25.115 --> 01:07:29.386
'Cause those kids give them
something to hold onto and love.

01:07:29.387 --> 01:07:30.391
No matter what.

01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:35.306
You know what?

01:07:35.331 --> 01:07:36.331
What?

01:07:37.026 --> 01:07:39.528
If I could put you in my pocket,

01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:41.049
- I'd take you wherever I go.
- Yeah...

01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:42.171
- I would.
- Don't do that.

01:07:43.133 --> 01:07:45.735
Don't do what?

01:07:45.736 --> 01:07:47.903
I want to talk about it.

01:07:47.904 --> 01:07:49.272
Well, okay, what?

01:07:50.272 --> 01:07:51.271
Kids?

01:07:52.039 --> 01:07:53.940
Us.

01:07:53.941 --> 01:07:56.344
Having a family.

01:07:56.345 --> 01:07:58.712
Look, we had an understanding
when we got married.

01:07:58.713 --> 01:08:00.213
And you agreed to it.

01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:01.583
Yeah, I know, I agreed.

01:08:01.584 --> 01:08:05.719
I guess I never felt like I was
worthy of being a mother before.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.024
Yeah, but what makes you feel
like we're worthy now?

01:08:11.024 --> 01:08:14.428
Shit. Look, I didn't mean
that you're not...

01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:16.729
Amanda, I'm sorry,

01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:18.765
but my feelings about this
still haven't changed.

01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:20.265
Yeah.

01:08:20.267 --> 01:08:21.441
I thought we'd already...

01:08:35.247 --> 01:08:37.059
The fire's
crowning along Jericho Road,

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:38.951
running north.
We're gonna get in front,

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:41.353
try to box her off and drive
her toward the canyon.

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:42.920
Copy, Granite Mountain.

01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:46.590
We have a heavy air tanker
working in that area.

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:49.327

First order of business,

01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:33.635
I want to protect this
structure, and then we're gonna

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.636
cut a line 30 feet off
the road, all right?

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.957
Hey, we're flying solo on this
one, so let's stay on point.

01:09:38.106 --> 01:09:39.586
- Understood?
- You got it, Supe!

01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:43.779
Shit, he doesn't know
we're here, man.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:44.779
Take cover! Take cover!

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:57.792
Holy shit!

01:10:03.163 --> 01:10:04.163
Whew!

01:10:05.299 --> 01:10:06.965
So much for
protecting that structure.

01:10:08.969 --> 01:10:10.803
- Y'all okay? Yeah?
- Everyone all right?

01:10:10.804 --> 01:10:12.573
- Fine.
- Yeah.

01:10:13.573 --> 01:10:14.573
All right, gear up.

01:10:15.075 --> 01:10:16.742
Get to work.

01:10:16.743 --> 01:10:18.977
Come on, let's go. Damn.

01:10:18.978 --> 01:10:20.411
I'm heading out!

01:10:20.412 --> 01:10:23.147
Why don't you have Marvel
set up the spare room for you?

01:10:23.148 --> 01:10:25.217
Drive home in the morning.

01:10:25.218 --> 01:10:27.352
Come on, it's a long drive
back to your place.

01:10:27.353 --> 01:10:29.821
Thanks, Duane. I can't.

01:10:29.822 --> 01:10:31.891
I got that big talk
at the ranch in the morning.

01:10:31.892 --> 01:10:33.458
So, got to go back
and get ready.

01:10:33.459 --> 01:10:35.792
Yeah, I'm sending some
people over to listen.

01:10:35.793 --> 01:10:37.962
I'd appreciate that.

01:10:37.963 --> 01:10:39.631
Could use some new clients.

01:10:39.632 --> 01:10:40.417
Ah, you'll get 'em.

01:10:43.368 --> 01:10:46.570
All we're doing
is lacing together this fuel.

01:10:46.571 --> 01:10:49.739
Just slow strokes,
back and forth.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.574
Wide spread.

01:10:51.575 --> 01:10:53.210
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:54.651
- You sure? All right.
- Yeah.

01:10:55.546 --> 01:10:57.747
I'll light you up.

01:10:57.748 --> 01:10:59.949
Our last chain, all right?

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:01.596
I'll be up the slope.

01:11:12.595 --> 01:11:15.731
Hey, Supe! My torch!

01:11:15.732 --> 01:11:17.370
Shit.

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:20.259
What happened?

01:11:20.284 --> 01:11:20.937
Hey, Supe?

01:11:20.938 --> 01:11:22.405
I just tossed it.
It was freaking out.

01:11:22.406 --> 01:11:23.571
It's all right.
It was a bad mix.

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:25.173
Steed, we're on our way out!

01:11:25.174 --> 01:11:26.339
Hold off on the burners!

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.508
Copy that.

01:11:27.509 --> 01:11:29.349
Come on!

01:11:51.932 --> 01:11:53.169
Come on.

01:11:55.169 --> 01:11:57.176
Whew!

01:12:13.252 --> 01:12:14.752
Holy shit!

01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:16.487
Yeah!

01:12:16.488 --> 01:12:17.488
That's an 8.5.

01:12:17.489 --> 01:12:18.622
No way.

01:12:18.623 --> 01:12:19.623
The last one was better.

01:12:21.093 --> 01:12:22.693
Oh, here she comes.

01:12:22.694 --> 01:12:23.376
Yeah!

01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:25.196
That's another one!

01:12:27.567 --> 01:12:28.567
Shit!

01:12:28.568 --> 01:12:29.733
Hey.

01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:32.602
Hey, Supe, I just want to thank
you for pulling me out earlier.

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:34.905
It was definitely an ass-puckerer,
wasn't it?

01:12:34.906 --> 01:12:38.308
No doubt, man.
I thought I was done.

01:12:38.309 --> 01:12:39.910
If this ain't the greatest
job in the world,

01:12:39.911 --> 01:12:41.411
I don't know what is.

01:12:41.412 --> 01:12:42.780
You got that right, Supe.

01:12:44.282 --> 01:12:45.281
Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:12:50.754 --> 01:12:51.696
That's a 10!

01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:52.588
Yeah!

01:12:52.589 --> 01:12:54.289
That's a 10.

All right.

01:13:44.339 --> 01:13:46.505
Confining a horse to a stall

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:49.742
or a small paddock
inhibits blood flow,

01:13:49.743 --> 01:13:52.477
and it damages receptors
in the hoof capsule.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.746
Horses are designed

01:14:19.704 --> 01:14:21.638

01:14:21.639 --> 01:14:22.639

01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:25.208
And I was fine. I am fine.

01:14:25.209 --> 01:14:26.376

01:14:31.214 --> 01:14:33.751
You don't get to do this, okay?

01:14:33.752 --> 01:14:36.452
I've had to learn how to live
my life without needing you,

01:14:36.453 --> 01:14:38.093
and now you're pissed
at me because of it?

01:14:39.056 --> 01:14:41.297
Screw that! You don't get
to have it both ways!

01:14:48.297 --> 01:14:49.297

01:15:03.912 --> 01:15:06.915
Yeah, I know. It's been
a really tough season,

01:15:06.916 --> 01:15:10.486
and I'm, like, doing the best I can.
You know?

01:15:10.487 --> 01:15:12.253
I know, but she doesn't
understand that.

01:15:12.254 --> 01:15:13.954
You're doing great.

01:15:13.955 --> 01:15:16.492
Young kids just
need consistency.

01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:23.297
Yay!

01:15:23.298 --> 01:15:24.798
Who's a big girl?

01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:26.335
Yeah, she is.

01:15:29.469 --> 01:15:31.469
Look at you. What?

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:33.907
What is that?

01:15:33.908 --> 01:15:36.909
All right, we got a new
start-up by Granite Mountain.

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:38.343
We're looking at the Doce Fire.

01:15:38.344 --> 01:15:40.413
Started up 8 miles
southwest of town.

01:15:40.414 --> 01:15:42.315
- Kicked up big last night.
- How big?

01:15:42.316 --> 01:15:43.836
Over 1,000 acres burned already.

01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:45.849
Burned through dry brush
straight towards town.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.952
We got a Red Flag Warning
in effect,

01:15:47.953 --> 01:15:49.254
40 mile-per-hour wind gusts

01:15:49.255 --> 01:15:52.357
and a relative humidity
as low as 3%.

01:15:52.358 --> 01:15:54.260
- A real ass-kicker.
- Hell, yeah.

01:15:54.261 --> 01:15:55.689
Two days off, right
back at it, boys.

01:15:56.328 --> 01:15:58.697
Hey, guys, listen up.

01:15:58.698 --> 01:16:01.531
The state has ordered
a management team.

01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:03.567
IC has asked me to head up
Division Bravo,

01:16:03.568 --> 01:16:06.637
so Steed is your Supe
on this next one.

01:16:06.638 --> 01:16:07.507
Nice one. Yeah, Steed!

01:16:08.506 --> 01:16:10.009
We got six
hotshot crews coming in.

01:16:11.009 --> 01:16:12.477
What's our deal?

01:16:12.478 --> 01:16:14.844
Well, no one knows this area
better than we do,

01:16:14.845 --> 01:16:18.683
and that's why I'm giving
you guys a special assignment.

01:16:25.054 --> 01:16:26.422
Fire's threatening Prescott,

01:16:26.423 --> 01:16:28.391
and we get stuck on
some chicken-shit detail

01:16:28.392 --> 01:16:30.227
- to protect a tree?
- Ah, it's lame, man.

01:16:30.228 --> 01:16:33.295
Lame-ass tree is a national treasure.
It's over 2,000 years old.

01:16:33.296 --> 01:16:35.696
But more importantly,
that tree is on our line.

01:16:35.697 --> 01:16:38.333
If the fire gets past our line,
it goes to our town.

01:16:38.334 --> 01:16:40.136
Quit your bitching, Turby.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.136
All right, well,
now I feel like an asshole.

01:16:42.137 --> 01:16:43.905
You are.

01:16:52.213 --> 01:16:53.747
Damn.

01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:55.250
- Now, that's a tree.
- That's something.

01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:57.318
That is definitely a tree.

01:17:00.088 --> 01:17:02.355
Wow.

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:04.192
I thought
it was gonna be bigger.

01:17:04.193 --> 01:17:05.759
All right.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.560
Let's prep 30 feet around her
and burn her off.

01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:08.163
All right.

01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:09.295
Come on, let's go to work!

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:10.296
Let's go, Alpha!

01:17:11.032 --> 01:17:11.608
All right, let's move!

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:12.264
That's right, Donut.

01:17:12.265 --> 01:17:13.532
Next tree, let's go.

01:17:18.773 --> 01:17:20.877
Hey, Donut,
grab this other tree.

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:24.813

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:28.313

Take more.

01:17:28.314 --> 01:17:29.882
Good job, Bravo.

01:17:29.883 --> 01:17:31.383
Hey, tie it in and let's go.

01:17:31.384 --> 01:17:32.664
Keep the line tight, move.

01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:37.289
This is our front door
she's knocking on.

01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:38.590
- Come on, move.
- Yeah, let's go.

01:17:38.591 --> 01:17:40.629
Let's get this nice, man.

01:18:04.749 --> 01:18:06.122
Here she comes.

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:34.942
Spot fire! One scrape!

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:35.628
Hey, I've got a spot!

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:37.444
I need two! Let's go!

01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:05.638
Now that's what I call a line!

01:19:05.639 --> 01:19:07.774
All right, guys,
let's mop it up!

01:19:07.775 --> 01:19:09.675
All right, Alpha!
Get it on!

01:19:09.676 --> 01:19:10.676
- Let's go!
- Nice work!

01:19:11.078 --> 01:19:12.311
- You heard him!
- Nice.

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.512

01:19:13.513 --> 01:19:14.846
Bravo, let's go, with me!

01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:16.282
That's you, bro.
Hey, nice work, nice work.

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:17.013
Let's get something to drink.

01:19:17.038 --> 01:19:17.716
Bottoms up.

01:19:17.717 --> 01:19:19.184
Move up the hill
and mop it up up here.

01:19:19.185 --> 01:19:20.684
Alpha boys, let's go!

01:19:20.685 --> 01:19:21.989
- Ready?
- Here we go.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.820
Hey, you're stepping
on my asshole.

01:19:25.057 --> 01:19:26.730
- Come on.
- Tight.

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:32.730
Granite Mountain on two.

01:19:33.032 --> 01:19:33.612
One, two...

01:19:34.565 --> 01:19:36.500
Granite Mountain!

01:19:42.073 --> 01:19:44.375
Hey, man, how are
things with our little girl?

01:19:44.376 --> 01:19:45.776
It's rough, man.

01:19:45.777 --> 01:19:48.278
I mean, when we came back
from that last fire,

01:19:48.279 --> 01:19:49.946
it's like she didn't
even recognize me.

01:19:49.947 --> 01:19:53.749
But Steed and Turby
seem to have it figured out.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:56.518
You know, whatever that is,
I want a piece of it.

01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:00.223
Oh! Dude!

01:20:00.224 --> 01:20:01.691
- Shit.
- What?

01:20:01.692 --> 01:20:03.959
Ah, dude.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.562
Oh, that's a rattler.

01:20:05.563 --> 01:20:08.562
No way did that
just happen, man.

01:20:08.563 --> 01:20:10.332
Where was your crew
working when you got bit?

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:13.836
We were cutting line around an
old tree near Granite Mountain.

01:20:13.837 --> 01:20:15.337
The big juniper?

01:20:15.338 --> 01:20:16.905
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:19.173
My husband proposed to
me under that tree.

01:20:19.174 --> 01:20:20.464
Describe the pain, one to 10.

01:20:20.489 --> 01:20:21.442
It's pretty bad.

01:20:21.443 --> 01:20:23.177
It's, like, moving
up my leg right now.

01:20:23.178 --> 01:20:25.613
So, Brendan, we're gonna
move you to another bed here.

01:20:25.614 --> 01:20:29.022
Gonna need you just to relax,
let us do the lifting, okay?

01:20:34.022 --> 01:20:35.689
Sir, I'm sorry, who are you?

01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:39.125
I'm Eric Marsh, Granite
Mountain Superintendent.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:40.794
Hey, Donut, how you doing?

01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:43.796
I don't know. Ask them.

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:45.631
Vitals look good, stable.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:46.933
You give him antivenom?

01:20:46.934 --> 01:20:48.661
No, and I'd rather not.

01:20:48.686 --> 01:20:49.236
Why?

01:20:49.237 --> 01:20:51.772
I would like to save that
bullet for when you really need it.

01:20:51.773 --> 01:20:54.108
Antibiotics and a morphine
drip will do the trick.

01:20:54.109 --> 01:20:56.107
No, I don't want any morphine.

01:20:56.108 --> 01:20:58.110
No painkillers, either.

01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:59.812
The ride's gonna be
a lot rougher without them.

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:00.775
Are you sure about that?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:21:04.617 --> 01:21:07.422
Hey, Donut,
what's your fifth watch-out?

01:21:09.422 --> 01:21:12.423
Uninformed on strategy,
tactics and hazards.

01:21:12.424 --> 01:21:14.225
There it is.

01:21:14.226 --> 01:21:15.759

Whoa, dude!

01:22:26.961 --> 01:22:29.562
We hunted that bastard
for 45 minutes, bro.

01:22:29.563 --> 01:22:30.380
That's good luck.

01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:32.865
- It's good luck.
- Yeah, it's good luck.

01:22:32.866 --> 01:22:34.333
- It is.
- You take it, then.

01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:36.804
Okay, really?

- Yeah.

really cool and smart.

01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:07.398

01:27:38.788 --> 01:27:40.555
No, man, I just wanted to...

01:27:40.556 --> 01:27:42.289
You know, I wanted
to talk to you for a sec.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.856
What? About what?

01:27:43.857 --> 01:27:48.229
Well, I wanted to thank you for
everything that you've done.

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.162
I didn't do anything.
All good.

01:27:50.163 --> 01:27:52.500
No, you took a big chance on me.
I know that.

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:55.071
Oh, the world's full of people
taking chances, Donut.

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:59.640
Jesus, Supe, why can't you
just say, "You're welcome"?

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:02.374
'Cause I'm uncomfortable
with gratitude.

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:03.742
I don't like it.

01:28:03.743 --> 01:28:04.743
All right, well, too bad.

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.580
That's what this is, gratitude.

01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:09.215
Okay. All right.

01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:10.416
I can live with that, I guess.

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.987
Oh, God.

01:28:13.987 --> 01:28:15.522
So, we good?

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:18.522
There's something else I do
want to talk to you about.

01:28:18.523 --> 01:28:21.659
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.161
and after this
fire season's over,

01:28:24.162 --> 01:28:26.697
I want to move over
to the structure side.

01:28:26.698 --> 01:28:31.637
And I was hoping maybe that you could put
in a good word with Chief Ellis for me.

01:28:31.638 --> 01:28:32.637
Okay.

01:28:33.338 --> 01:28:35.040
All right.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.642
All right, let me just
see if I got this down.

01:28:38.643 --> 01:28:42.379
So, you brought me
out here to thank me

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.347
for giving you a chance
that nobody

01:28:44.348 --> 01:28:47.252
on the face of the fucking
Earth would give you,

01:28:47.253 --> 01:28:49.852
and your way of
showing appreciation is

01:28:49.853 --> 01:28:52.555
to then say to me that, what,

01:28:52.556 --> 01:28:54.058
you're gonna quit on me
and this crew?

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:11.674
Look, Supe,
I'm having a hard time.

01:29:11.675 --> 01:29:13.774
It's tough.

01:29:13.775 --> 01:29:16.377
I'm having a hard time being
a good dad and doing this job.

01:29:16.378 --> 01:29:18.080
Okay, everybody's having
a hard time

01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:20.448
because most of the men
on this crew have families.

01:29:20.449 --> 01:29:22.216
And I don't hear any of them
bitching, do you?

01:29:22.217 --> 01:29:24.085
Yeah, look, I can't
speak to that, okay?

01:29:24.086 --> 01:29:24.860
I don't know. I...

01:29:24.885 --> 01:29:25.719
No, you can't.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.121
I didn't have a dad growing up.

01:29:27.122 --> 01:29:28.722
He wasn't around
for me, so when...

01:29:28.723 --> 01:29:30.424
I'm not gonna do that
to my daughter, man.

01:29:30.425 --> 01:29:31.425
- That's it.
- So what?

01:29:33.228 --> 01:29:35.664
So what, Donut, huh?

01:29:35.665 --> 01:29:37.598
I mean, do you think
anyone's gonna hire

01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:39.432
a cheese-dick like you
on the structure side,

01:29:39.433 --> 01:29:41.801
an asshole with
a record and a rep?

01:29:41.802 --> 01:29:44.571
That's just never gonna happen.

01:29:44.572 --> 01:29:46.472
And then what? Huh?

01:29:46.473 --> 01:29:48.407
You're gonna be
washing dishes, miserable?

01:29:48.408 --> 01:29:50.477
How long you think
you're gonna stay clean then?

01:29:50.478 --> 01:29:53.848
Now, listen to me. Listen.

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:57.917
If you quit this crew,

01:29:57.918 --> 01:30:00.963
you're gonna either end up
dead or behind bars.

01:30:19.704 --> 01:30:22.106
♪ Copperhead Road

01:30:22.107 --> 01:30:24.876
Hey, come on, let's go.
Come on.

01:30:24.877 --> 01:30:25.683
Are you all right?

01:30:25.708 --> 01:30:27.005
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:30.981 --> 01:30:33.622
♪ Copperhead Road ♪

01:30:50.233 --> 01:30:52.011
- Happens all the time.
- Yeah.

01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:54.836
Guys are always leaving crews
because of family.

01:30:54.837 --> 01:30:56.172
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

01:30:56.173 --> 01:30:57.975
So why are you
so pissed at this kid?

01:30:58.975 --> 01:31:01.442
'Cause a year ago he was a
junkie, tonight he's a hero.

01:31:01.443 --> 01:31:02.610
Huh.

01:31:02.611 --> 01:31:05.113
I mean, come on,
this job saved his life,

01:31:05.114 --> 01:31:07.315
and now he'll probably end up
right back where he started.

01:31:07.316 --> 01:31:08.717
Well, if you think
that he might relapse,

01:31:08.718 --> 01:31:11.619
maybe you should take him
to a meeting with you.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.288
Does he even know
that you go to meetings?

01:31:13.289 --> 01:31:14.789
It's nobody's business
but my own.

01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:16.157
Okay, so you're pissed
'cause you think

01:31:16.158 --> 01:31:17.858
he owes the job something more
than his own daughter.

01:31:17.859 --> 01:31:18.549
I didn't say that.

01:31:18.574 --> 01:31:22.229
Oh, maybe it's 'cause he made
the choice that you're avoiding.

01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:24.698
His thing has nothing
to do with me, okay?

01:31:24.699 --> 01:31:25.943
I think it's got
everything to do with it.

01:31:25.967 --> 01:31:27.734
No, no. I don't,
I don't want to do this.

01:31:27.735 --> 01:31:29.837
Well, you know what?
You've had one day off

01:31:29.838 --> 01:31:31.672
in the last month,
which you spent sleeping,

01:31:31.673 --> 01:31:34.578
so when are we
supposed to do it?

01:31:37.578 --> 01:31:39.077
What? What?

01:31:39.078 --> 01:31:40.613
I'll tell you what!

01:31:40.614 --> 01:31:43.215
You live your life
in a glass box

01:31:43.216 --> 01:31:46.184
with a sign that says,
"Break in case of fire"!

01:31:46.185 --> 01:31:48.023
You are 90% hotshot,
you are 10% mine,

01:31:49.022 --> 01:31:50.722
and that is not enough!

01:31:50.723 --> 01:31:52.390
What is that? Is that an ultimatum?
Is that what that...

01:31:52.391 --> 01:31:54.526
No, I'm telling you how I feel,
and that's different.

01:31:54.527 --> 01:31:56.561
I want a family
with the man that I love.

01:31:56.562 --> 01:31:59.363
You knew exactly what the deal
was when we got into this, okay?

01:31:59.364 --> 01:32:00.631
I've been straight with you...

01:32:00.632 --> 01:32:01.872
Yeah, fine.
I don't give a shit!

01:32:02.033 --> 01:32:03.369
From the first day that we met!

01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:04.635
We were in the same place then!

01:32:04.636 --> 01:32:06.370
That was six years ago,

01:32:06.371 --> 01:32:09.473
and people are supposed to be
changed by their relationships!

01:32:09.474 --> 01:32:12.442
That's what happened to me!

01:32:12.443 --> 01:32:14.777
I let you in!

01:32:14.778 --> 01:32:16.116
I've been changed by you!

01:32:17.116 --> 01:32:18.816
I'm a different person!

01:32:18.817 --> 01:32:22.217
I have moved on from my
addiction, and you are still

01:32:22.218 --> 01:32:25.129
fucking feeding yours
with another kind of drug!

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:33.663
Where are you going?

01:32:33.664 --> 01:32:35.468
For a walk!

01:32:57.118 --> 01:32:58.786
I didn't know who else to call.

01:32:58.787 --> 01:33:00.161
Sit down.

01:33:12.733 --> 01:33:14.502
Do you know
where I'm at right now?

01:33:15.502 --> 01:33:16.502
Oh, yeah.

01:33:17.971 --> 01:33:19.642
I've been there.

01:33:22.009 --> 01:33:24.576
I don't know what to do.

01:33:24.577 --> 01:33:26.282
Yeah, well,

01:33:27.281 --> 01:33:29.647
you got to ask yourself,

01:33:29.648 --> 01:33:35.022
"What can I live with
and what can I die without?"

01:33:36.022 --> 01:33:38.457
You know what I mean?

01:33:38.458 --> 01:33:39.458
No, I don't.

01:33:43.561 --> 01:33:44.561
Yeah.

01:33:46.231 --> 01:33:47.231
I don't know.

01:33:49.133 --> 01:33:52.837
You know, when I was
a Globe Hotshot...

01:33:52.838 --> 01:33:55.739
Maybe 26, 27...

01:33:57.009 --> 01:34:00.810
I worked this blaze
near Big Timber, Montana.

01:34:00.811 --> 01:34:03.916
It was night, and
she just wasn't laying down.

01:34:04.916 --> 01:34:08.184
Conditions going
from mean to wicked.

01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:13.090
And me and my crew pulled back into
the black of this wide-open grassland

01:34:13.091 --> 01:34:15.558
set right at the foot
of this sprawling forest,

01:34:15.559 --> 01:34:18.427
just a few thousand acres
of tall, dense pine,

01:34:18.428 --> 01:34:21.433
all of it green
and packed with resin.

01:34:25.434 --> 01:34:28.005
And all of a sudden,

01:34:29.005 --> 01:34:32.441
this savage wind kicked up,

01:34:32.442 --> 01:34:37.512
and it carried with it this
tidal wave of brands and fire,

01:34:37.513 --> 01:34:40.182
just sweeping through the trees.

01:34:40.183 --> 01:34:44.352
And just in the blink
of an eye, the whole stretch

01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:48.557
turned into a blast furnace,
just fire everywhere.

01:34:50.557 --> 01:34:52.560
And then,

01:34:52.561 --> 01:34:56.196
charging out of these flames,

01:34:56.197 --> 01:35:00.203
all of a sudden comes this bear.

01:35:01.203 --> 01:35:03.539
And the bear's on fire.

01:35:04.539 --> 01:35:06.774
And he's running.

01:35:07.774 --> 01:35:10.444
And he just barrels
right past us,

01:35:11.444 --> 01:35:13.846
and keeps running,

01:35:13.847 --> 01:35:16.252
hard-charging into the darkness.

01:35:18.252 --> 01:35:20.355
That bear on fire

01:35:22.354 --> 01:35:26.698
was the most beautiful and
terrible thing I've ever seen.

01:35:32.698 --> 01:35:34.982
I'm feeling a lot like
that bear right now, Duane.

01:36:20.342 --> 01:36:22.646
I'm yours.

01:36:24.646 --> 01:36:26.547
I'm yours, Manda-bear.

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:50.170
Yeah, this is Marsh.

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:51.705
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:52.706
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:54.443
Okay.

01:36:59.845 --> 01:37:01.481
Hey, Jesse.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:04.216
We got a new start down in Yarnell.
Lightning strike.

01:37:04.217 --> 01:37:06.352
Yeah, go ahead, ring the bell.

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.353
We'll see you in a few.

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.057
What's up?

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:13.691
Oh, a skunker down in Yarnell.

01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:15.861
It's no big deal.

01:37:16.861 --> 01:37:17.861
Kiss.

01:37:19.665 --> 01:37:21.801
Yes, ma'am.

01:37:22.801 --> 01:37:24.409
Hmm.

01:37:30.409 --> 01:37:32.542
I love you, Shortstop.

01:37:32.543 --> 01:37:34.043
You, too, Sugartits.

01:37:35.846 --> 01:37:38.149
Go back to sleep.

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:40.600
I'll probably be
home for dinner.

01:38:02.707 --> 01:38:05.710
Not a skunker anymore, Supe.
She's moving fast.

01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:11.416
Jesse, this is gonna be
my last year as Supe.

01:38:13.416 --> 01:38:15.158
The job is yours if you want it.

01:38:23.157 --> 01:38:25.325
Fire's threatening homes
in Peeples Valley,

01:38:25.326 --> 01:38:27.628
so we've ordered
three more hotshot crews.

01:38:27.629 --> 01:38:29.296
In the meantime,
I want Granite Mountain

01:38:29.297 --> 01:38:32.498
to set an anchor here on the
southwest heel of the fire.

01:38:32.499 --> 01:38:35.069
Keep it from running at Yarnell
if the weather shifts.

01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:36.637
Now, there's a safety zone here

01:38:36.638 --> 01:38:40.673
at Boulder Springs Ranch,
fireproof, built of nonflammables.

01:38:40.674 --> 01:38:42.009
The vegetation's been cleared.

01:38:43.009 --> 01:38:44.644
- Ferguson?
- Yeah.

01:38:44.645 --> 01:38:46.779
You and
Blue River will cut here,

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:50.783
east of Marsh's crew, and your
fallback will be this two-track road.

01:38:50.784 --> 01:38:53.585
We've established
three trigger points.

01:38:53.586 --> 01:38:56.455
First trigger for Yarnell evac
should take an hour.

01:38:56.456 --> 01:38:59.425
Second trigger,
all crews retreat.

01:38:59.426 --> 01:39:00.426
Third,

01:39:02.095 --> 01:39:04.564
no one should be
near Yarnell, okay?

01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:21.178
- Come on, keep it tight!
- Tight!

01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:22.179
Tight!

01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.481
Tight.

01:39:23.482 --> 01:39:24.482
Tight!

01:39:24.483 --> 01:39:25.656
Tight!

01:39:30.655 --> 01:39:32.088
- Steeder.
- Yo.

01:39:32.089 --> 01:39:33.289
Tell me
we're gonna be off this shit

01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:34.356
and home by
tomorrow night. Please.

01:39:34.357 --> 01:39:35.357
Hope so.

01:39:35.927 --> 01:39:37.628
- He's got a big date.
- Yeah? With who?

01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:39.862
That barely legal hottie
from the party?

01:39:39.863 --> 01:39:42.164
That right? She got a sister?

01:39:42.165 --> 01:39:45.133
Look, guys, back off.
He met a girl that he really likes.

01:39:45.134 --> 01:39:46.534
No way. Who?

01:39:46.535 --> 01:39:48.337
One of the nurses
who took care of me.

01:39:48.338 --> 01:39:50.975
She's, like, 27,
gives a great IV.

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:53.708
She's nice.

01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:55.778
- So, you closed?
- Like I said, brother.

01:39:55.779 --> 01:39:57.512
Not like that.

01:39:57.513 --> 01:39:59.848
What, is she playing
hard to get?

01:39:59.849 --> 01:40:00.839
More like hard to forget.

01:40:00.864 --> 01:40:01.750
Oh, that's, like,

01:40:01.751 --> 01:40:04.085
the cutest thing I ever
heard you say, man.

01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:05.319
I know, dude.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:08.422
This girl scares
the shit out of me.

01:40:08.423 --> 01:40:10.591
That's good, brother.

01:40:10.592 --> 01:40:11.719
That's how you know it's real.

01:40:11.743 --> 01:40:12.693
Ah, shit.

01:40:13.695 --> 01:40:14.729
Hey, hold up.

01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:16.398
- Hold up.
- Hold up.

01:40:17.398 --> 01:40:19.866
Gonna establish our anchor here.

01:40:19.867 --> 01:40:21.837
Alpha down below,
Bravo upstairs.

01:40:22.837 --> 01:40:25.908
Not even 10:00 a.m.,
105 and climbing.

01:40:26.908 --> 01:40:28.774
Embrace the suck.

01:40:34.982 --> 01:40:36.449
Operations,
this is Granite Mountain.

01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:39.084
We got clouds forming
above Peeples Valley.

01:40:39.085 --> 01:40:41.605
They start to grow, the fire's
gonna get a lot worse real quick.

01:40:41.955 --> 01:40:44.124
Our line's ready
to burn right now.

01:40:44.125 --> 01:40:45.791
Copy, Granite Mountain.

01:40:45.792 --> 01:40:47.129
You got the green light to burn.

01:40:49.128 --> 01:40:51.730
All right, copy that.

01:40:52.732 --> 01:40:53.798
Tie it in!

01:40:53.799 --> 01:40:55.299
Tied in.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.635
Tied in!

01:40:56.636 --> 01:40:59.004
All right, Jesse, flip the torches,
get ready for a burn.

01:41:00.004 --> 01:41:02.106
Copy.

01:41:02.107 --> 01:41:03.775
Back to the anchor!

01:41:03.776 --> 01:41:05.775
- Bravo Squad, swap that brush.
- Get ready to burn!

01:41:05.778 --> 01:41:08.045
- Let's go, guys!
- Get ready to burn!

01:41:08.046 --> 01:41:09.447
Uh, hey, Donut.

01:41:09.448 --> 01:41:11.254
Come with me for a sec.

01:41:16.254 --> 01:41:17.254
Listen, uh...

01:41:20.058 --> 01:41:21.229
I'm sorry about last night.

01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:29.131
Now, I don't know how to explain,
but sometimes we...

01:41:29.132 --> 01:41:31.300
We don't see things as they are.

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:35.404
You know, we see them as we are.

01:41:35.405 --> 01:41:36.705
You understand that?

01:41:36.706 --> 01:41:39.308
Yeah. Think so.

01:41:39.309 --> 01:41:40.978
What happened wasn't about you.

01:41:41.978 --> 01:41:43.084
It was about me.

01:41:48.084 --> 01:41:49.723
I was you.

01:41:53.722 --> 01:41:59.325
I will help you out in any way I
can, so long as you walk the line.

01:41:59.326 --> 01:42:00.999
Do you hear me?

01:42:03.999 --> 01:42:05.941
Thanks, Supe.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.677
All right.

01:42:17.677 --> 01:42:19.111
Light it!

01:42:19.112 --> 01:42:23.117
After we burn this off,
we head back down, boys.

01:42:23.118 --> 01:42:25.119
Woyjeck, put more fuel down.

01:42:26.118 --> 01:42:27.887
Watch for spots.

01:42:28.887 --> 01:42:31.993
Burners,
pace off the guy on the line.

01:42:34.993 --> 01:42:36.163
Shit!

01:42:42.167 --> 01:42:43.867
- God!
- What an idiot!

01:42:43.868 --> 01:42:45.303
Air Attack, Granite Mountain!

01:42:45.304 --> 01:42:47.439
Your tanker just
dumped on our burn.

01:42:48.439 --> 01:42:50.174
Repeat, Granite Mountain.

01:42:50.175 --> 01:42:52.676
You're putting out
the wrong damn fires.

01:42:52.677 --> 01:42:55.349
Hey, Supe, none of this shit's
gonna light off now.

01:42:56.349 --> 01:42:58.714
What's your move?

01:42:58.715 --> 01:43:00.717
All right, tie it off here.

01:43:00.718 --> 01:43:02.889
Take the line
all the way up the ridge.

01:43:04.889 --> 01:43:07.156
Hey, Donut, come here.

01:43:07.157 --> 01:43:08.558
How's that leg, buddy?

01:43:08.559 --> 01:43:10.627
Think you can handle a lookout?

01:43:10.628 --> 01:43:11.628
Yeah.

01:43:13.165 --> 01:43:14.696
Good spot right over there.

01:43:14.697 --> 01:43:16.865
Just make sure you got
your weather kit handy.

01:43:16.866 --> 01:43:18.801
Keep an eye on those clouds.

01:43:18.802 --> 01:43:20.703
You got it, Supe.

01:43:23.706 --> 01:43:25.240
Heard you on the TAC channel.

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.041
- You moving the line?
- Yeah, next hill over.

01:43:27.878 --> 01:43:30.213
Goddamn air tanker
really screwed the pooch.

01:43:30.214 --> 01:43:33.347
We're moving to a secondary line,
but we'll adjust to you.

01:43:33.348 --> 01:43:35.817
You mind taking my lookout,
Donut here, give him a lift?

01:43:35.818 --> 01:43:38.853
No. Hop on.

01:43:38.854 --> 01:43:41.193
- Cool to hop in the back?
- You got it.

01:43:44.193 --> 01:43:45.193
All right.

01:43:45.194 --> 01:43:46.360
See you later.

01:43:46.361 --> 01:43:47.896
This side or the other, brother.

01:43:48.896 --> 01:43:49.932
Later, Donut.

01:43:51.932 --> 01:43:53.434
Don't miss me too much.

01:43:53.435 --> 01:43:55.602
Get out of here, Donut!

01:43:55.603 --> 01:43:58.315
Granite Mountain, line it up!

01:44:08.314 --> 01:44:09.314
Thanks, man.

01:44:09.315 --> 01:44:10.398
You got it.

01:44:49.288 --> 01:44:52.123
Granite Mountain,
stand by for weather.

01:44:52.124 --> 01:44:53.523
Yeah, how does it look?

01:44:53.524 --> 01:44:55.125
Temp is 104,

01:44:55.126 --> 01:44:57.594
RH 6%, so I'll keep
an eye on that.

01:44:57.595 --> 01:44:59.828
Wind is 10 to 15 from the south,

01:44:59.829 --> 01:45:01.764
and those clouds are building.

01:45:01.765 --> 01:45:02.765
Yeah, I see 'em.

01:45:02.934 --> 01:45:04.436
Keep an eye on it.

01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:14.644
Shit.

01:45:23.519 --> 01:45:25.120
Granite Mountain,
winds are changing here.

01:45:25.121 --> 01:45:27.256
It's 25 to 35 from the north.

01:45:28.256 --> 01:45:30.630
Yeah, we feel it.
What do you see?

01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:38.535
Fire's picking up, and it's
moving towards my location.

01:45:39.535 --> 01:45:41.335
Okay, time for you
to get out of there, Donut.

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.272
It just hit the ridge.

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.507
I'm gonna make my way back
towards the dozer.

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:49.508
Copy that, Donut.

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:10.330
All right, hey,
I'm at the dozer.

01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.064
Copy.

01:46:14.399 --> 01:46:16.603
Hey, shit, man, it's too close.
I got to move!

01:46:17.603 --> 01:46:19.237
Donut, stay calm.

01:46:19.238 --> 01:46:21.406
Follow the two-track road.
That's your escape route.

01:46:26.045 --> 01:46:27.612
Hey, my escape route's been...

01:46:27.613 --> 01:46:29.013
Granite Mountain,
the fire just hit

01:46:29.014 --> 01:46:31.848
the first trigger point
much faster than we expected.

01:46:31.849 --> 01:46:33.719
We need to move.

01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:36.219
Ops, Granite Mountain.

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:38.188
Dozer and retardant line
have been compromised.

01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:40.557
- We're pulling back into the black.
- Copy.

01:46:40.558 --> 01:46:42.078
Granite Mountain,
pack it up! Let's go!

01:46:42.926 --> 01:46:44.061
Pack it up!

01:46:48.232 --> 01:46:50.768
Donut, what's your position?

01:46:51.768 --> 01:46:52.928
Come on, Donut, copy me, man.

01:47:01.978 --> 01:47:03.150
Hey!

01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:09.655
Heard you on the radio.

01:47:12.655 --> 01:47:15.190
Boys, I've got your lookout.
Fire's making its push.

01:47:15.191 --> 01:47:16.831
We're gonna go back and bump
your buggies.

01:47:16.926 --> 01:47:20.193
Copy that. Thanks for
looking out for our boy.

01:47:20.194 --> 01:47:21.834
I'm gonna go up top,
take a look up there.

01:47:21.895 --> 01:47:24.098
Copy.

01:47:24.099 --> 01:47:27.233
Blue River,
can you burn your line off?

01:47:27.234 --> 01:47:28.274
Negative. Line is overrun.

01:47:28.869 --> 01:47:30.571
- Pulling back to Yarnell.
- Copy.

01:47:30.572 --> 01:47:32.406
You get your Supe truck.
We got your buggies.

01:47:32.407 --> 01:47:34.282
Let's go.

01:47:48.921 --> 01:47:50.255
Granite Mountain, Operations.

01:47:50.256 --> 01:47:51.256
What's your position?

01:47:51.891 --> 01:47:53.224
Ops, Granite Mountain.

01:47:53.225 --> 01:47:55.662
- Still holding in the black.
- Copy that.

01:47:56.662 --> 01:47:57.897
Hey, so, uh...

01:47:58.897 --> 01:48:01.299
Next Thursday,
my band's playing.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.945
- Ooh, yeah, sorry, got a thing.
- Don't...

01:48:02.969 --> 01:48:04.409
With your immediate
negativity, okay?

01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:06.210
We're not coming, dude.

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:09.978
- Why not?
- Because the Firelords suck ass, man. They're terrible.

01:48:10.941 --> 01:48:13.177
We're not the
Firelords anymore, okay?

01:48:13.178 --> 01:48:14.812
- We changed it.
- Yeah?

01:48:14.813 --> 01:48:16.547
- To what?
- Hour of the Wolf.

01:48:16.548 --> 01:48:17.548
Still suck.

01:48:18.717 --> 01:48:21.052
If it was the other way around,
I'd be there supporting each of you guys.

01:48:21.053 --> 01:48:22.619
Oh, boo!

01:48:23.653 --> 01:48:24.555
Fine, fine.

01:48:24.556 --> 01:48:25.723
Brewskies are on me.

01:48:26.723 --> 01:48:28.358
- Yeah!
- Oh!

01:48:28.359 --> 01:48:29.359
Suddenly we're free.

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:31.060
Air Attack, Operations.

01:48:31.061 --> 01:48:32.461
Where are those
heavy air tankers?

01:48:32.896 --> 01:48:35.198
They're inbound,
but still 10 minutes out.

01:48:35.199 --> 01:48:36.279
Come on, knock it out, man!

01:48:42.972 --> 01:48:45.253
Granite Mountain,
can you redeploy to Yarnell?

01:48:45.908 --> 01:48:47.979
The fire's advancing
on trigger point two.

01:48:48.979 --> 01:48:51.581
How long is he gonna
keep us safe in the black?

01:48:51.582 --> 01:48:53.148
I mean it, Jesse,
I don't want to stand around

01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:55.483
like a worthless piece of shit
while this town burns.

01:48:55.484 --> 01:48:57.718
Easy, brother.

01:48:57.719 --> 01:48:59.322
None of us do.

01:49:00.322 --> 01:49:02.990
Steeder.

01:49:02.991 --> 01:49:04.433
What's the plan here?

01:49:11.433 --> 01:49:13.767
Well,

01:49:13.768 --> 01:49:17.309
they're not doing anything to
slow you down at all, are they?

01:49:22.309 --> 01:49:26.178
Air Attack, Granite Mountain. What's
the status on the air tankers?

01:49:26.179 --> 01:49:29.048
Granite Mountain,
air tankers have been delayed.

01:49:29.049 --> 01:49:30.815
We got homes burning in Yarnell,

01:49:30.816 --> 01:49:33.261
and base camp's being pushed.

01:49:41.261 --> 01:49:42.761
Jesse, I think we should move on

01:49:42.762 --> 01:49:45.198
to our escape route,
head down to the ranch

01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:46.997
and work the fire from there.

01:49:46.998 --> 01:49:49.001
We're the only crew in
position to save these homes.

01:49:49.002 --> 01:49:51.002
You and the boys down
for getting back in the game?

01:49:53.939 --> 01:49:55.706
You guys hear that?

01:49:55.707 --> 01:49:56.604
Let's go to work, Supe.

01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:58.009
All right, back to work, boys.

01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.687
Back to work.

01:49:58.712 --> 01:49:59.676
Come on, man,

01:49:59.677 --> 01:50:00.417
this is what we were born to do.

01:50:00.442 --> 01:50:01.113
Let's break a sweat, boys.

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.451
Let's get it!

01:50:06.451 --> 01:50:08.451
- What?
- Let's put this bad boy out.

01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:12.255
Let's go, Ashcraft!

01:50:12.256 --> 01:50:14.224
Ops, Granite Mountain.

01:50:14.225 --> 01:50:16.559
I want to pass on that we're gonna
make our way toward our escape route.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.361
You guys
are in the black, correct?

01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:20.096
Yep. We're gonna pick our way
through the black,

01:50:20.097 --> 01:50:21.597
and then on toward the ranch.

01:50:21.598 --> 01:50:23.737
Copy that.

01:50:26.737 --> 01:50:29.472
Donut, fire just hit trigger
point two. We're pulling back

01:50:29.473 --> 01:50:30.323
to the restaurant.

01:50:30.348 --> 01:50:31.434
Copy, Blue River.

01:50:48.757 --> 01:50:50.158
Ops, Granite Mountain.

01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:52.993
We're going down our escape
route to our safety zone.

01:50:52.994 --> 01:50:54.765
Is everything okay?

01:50:56.765 --> 01:50:58.299
Yeah.

01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.300
We're just moving.

01:50:59.301 --> 01:51:00.522
Copy.

01:51:21.521 --> 01:51:24.157
Steed, you with me?

01:51:24.158 --> 01:51:26.657
Yeah, we're with you.
Coming off the black and into the canyon.

01:51:26.658 --> 01:51:29.461
I'm almost at the ranch.
Looks good.

01:51:29.462 --> 01:51:31.332
Be able to reengage
the fire from there.

01:51:33.332 --> 01:51:36.035
All right, guys.
Keep the pace and watch your footing.

01:51:36.036 --> 01:51:37.436
Watch your footing.

01:51:37.437 --> 01:51:38.937
Watch your footing.

01:51:38.938 --> 01:51:40.806
Watch your footing.

01:51:42.674 --> 01:51:44.342
Come on through.

01:51:44.343 --> 01:51:46.052
You, too. Let's go.

01:51:53.052 --> 01:51:54.052
Hey, how can I help?

01:51:54.053 --> 01:51:55.652
Just wait here with my crew.

01:51:55.653 --> 01:51:57.787
I'm gonna check in
with Operations to get orders.

01:51:57.788 --> 01:51:59.788
All right.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

01:51:59.789 --> 01:52:01.289
I owe you one.

01:52:01.290 --> 01:52:02.830
Just sit tight, all right?

01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:08.731
Air Attack, Operations.

01:52:08.732 --> 01:52:11.033
We've got a storm cell
that's developed to the north

01:52:11.034 --> 01:52:13.568
with heavy wind gusts
toward the southwest.

01:52:13.569 --> 01:52:16.471
Fire has just hit
trigger point three.

01:52:16.472 --> 01:52:17.742
It's making a run.

01:52:29.519 --> 01:52:33.089
I copy, yeah.
We're getting 50-mile-an-hour wind gusts here.

01:52:34.089 --> 01:52:35.089
Oh...

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:00.580
Hey, Supe!

01:53:02.217 --> 01:53:05.150
Prepare deployment
site right here. Now!

01:53:05.151 --> 01:53:06.785
We can't go back up there.

01:53:06.786 --> 01:53:09.555
There's no time, Jesse.

01:53:09.556 --> 01:53:12.492
Deployment site! Right here, right now!
Let's go!

01:53:12.493 --> 01:53:13.493
Deployment site!

01:53:13.494 --> 01:53:14.827
Deployment site!

01:53:14.828 --> 01:53:17.497
Breaking in on Arizona 16!
Granite Mountain Hotshots!

01:53:17.498 --> 01:53:19.403
We are in front
of the flaming front!

01:53:29.041 --> 01:53:30.041
Burning!

01:53:30.042 --> 01:53:31.775
Burning!

01:53:31.776 --> 01:53:33.545
Burn around the perimeter!

01:53:33.546 --> 01:53:35.713
Ashcraft, next tree!

01:53:35.714 --> 01:53:38.282
Granite Mountain, we're
gonna bring you the air tanker, okay?

01:53:38.283 --> 01:53:41.551
You got it! That's exactly
where we want the drop!

01:53:41.552 --> 01:53:43.120
Operations, Air Attack.

01:53:43.121 --> 01:53:46.323
Do you have a firm location
on Granite Mountain?

01:53:46.324 --> 01:53:48.244
Air Attack, Granite Mountain.
How do you read me?

01:53:51.996 --> 01:53:53.763
Air Attack, Granite Mountain!

01:53:53.764 --> 01:53:55.644
Drop!

01:54:10.914 --> 01:54:13.414
Air Attack, Granite Mountain.

01:54:13.415 --> 01:54:16.985
Okay,
Granite Mountain. Air Attack.

01:54:16.986 --> 01:54:18.986
Okay, I'm here with
Granite Mountain Hotshots,

01:54:18.987 --> 01:54:20.467
and our escape route
has been cut off.

01:54:20.857 --> 01:54:21.857
Come on, man.

01:54:21.858 --> 01:54:23.825
We are preparing
a deployment site.

01:54:23.826 --> 01:54:27.362
We are burning out
around ourselves...

01:54:27.363 --> 01:54:29.529
In the brush.

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:32.033
And I'll call you
when we're under our...

01:54:32.034 --> 01:54:33.479
The shelters.

01:54:44.478 --> 01:54:46.313
Okay, copy that.

01:54:46.314 --> 01:54:48.715
So, you're on the south side
of the fire, then?

01:54:48.716 --> 01:54:49.716
Affirm!

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.322
Deploy!

01:54:55.323 --> 01:54:56.323
Deploy!

01:54:56.324 --> 01:54:57.388
Deploy!

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:08.599
Get your feet to the fire!

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.670
Water! Get your water!

01:55:10.671 --> 01:55:12.403
Feet to the fire!

01:55:12.404 --> 01:55:14.237
Rookies on the inside!

01:55:14.238 --> 01:55:15.238
Jesse!

01:55:15.239 --> 01:55:16.673
What?

01:55:16.674 --> 01:55:18.683
You, too!

01:55:49.571 --> 01:55:53.176
Oh, God. God, help me.

01:55:54.176 --> 01:55:55.176
Mack?

01:55:57.047 --> 01:55:58.382
It's gonna be okay!

01:55:59.382 --> 01:56:02.750
Okay. Okay.

01:56:20.367 --> 01:56:21.911
Granite Mountain, Operations.

01:56:21.935 --> 01:56:23.536
Now, I need you
to pay attention.

01:56:23.537 --> 01:56:26.373
And tell me when
you hear the aircraft, okay?

01:56:26.374 --> 01:56:28.741
'Cause it's gonna be a little
tough for us to see you.

01:56:34.049 --> 01:56:37.516
Okay, we're working
our way around there.

01:56:37.517 --> 01:56:41.186
We've got several aircraft
coming to you.

01:56:41.187 --> 01:56:43.623
I'll see if we can't
take care of business for you.

01:56:46.959 --> 01:56:49.294
Granite Mountain,
do you hear a helicopter?

01:57:44.179 --> 01:57:45.282
I got eyes! I got eyes!

01:58:33.492 --> 01:58:34.993
Operations.

01:58:34.994 --> 01:58:36.474
Yeah, go ahead.

01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:39.365
Uh, medic on scene.

01:58:39.366 --> 01:58:42.041
Nineteen, confirmed.

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.642
Okay, I copy.

01:58:50.643 --> 01:58:52.977
Let's go ahead
and obviously secure the area.

01:58:52.978 --> 01:58:55.246
We'll go from there.

01:59:07.959 --> 01:59:10.508
No, no, no, no!

01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:48.464
Bringing all the families
over to Prescott Middle School.

01:59:48.465 --> 01:59:50.269
Setting up a whole thing
for the fallout.

01:59:53.268 --> 01:59:55.639
That's where I want to go.

01:59:57.639 --> 02:00:00.279
I don't think that's a
good idea, Brendan.

02:00:00.742 --> 02:00:02.102
Let me just take you
to your mom's.

02:00:04.946 --> 02:00:06.250
Take me to the gym.

02:00:13.853 --> 02:00:15.355
- Yeah?
- Duane,

02:00:15.356 --> 02:00:17.155
I just talked to the sheriff.

02:00:17.156 --> 02:00:18.259
He's saying 19.

02:00:19.259 --> 02:00:20.459
You're sure?

02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:22.027
I'm afraid so.

02:00:22.028 --> 02:00:24.363
But he told me that
one of them got out okay.

02:00:24.364 --> 02:00:26.597
Is that confirmed?

02:00:26.598 --> 02:00:29.467
I don't know.
I'm so sorry, Duane.

02:00:29.468 --> 02:00:31.542
I know.
Thank you, Kathy.

02:00:35.542 --> 02:00:37.108
Duane.

02:00:42.847 --> 02:00:46.183
It's just not good.

02:00:46.184 --> 02:00:49.322
Oh, no. No.

02:01:19.515 --> 02:01:21.083
Duane.

02:01:21.084 --> 02:01:23.518
Duane, what's going on?

02:01:23.519 --> 02:01:25.187
- Are they okay?
- I'm gonna find out right now.

02:01:25.188 --> 02:01:27.795
Please, just hold on.

02:01:31.794 --> 02:01:35.463
Huck, what's going on?
What did you tell these people?

02:01:35.464 --> 02:01:37.031
Nothing.

02:01:37.032 --> 02:01:39.200
We can't tell them until
the grief counselors get here.

02:01:39.201 --> 02:01:40.968
- Well, how long?
- Twenty minutes.

02:01:40.969 --> 02:01:42.369
They're driving in from Phoenix.

02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:45.305
We heard there was
one survivor. Is that true?

02:01:45.306 --> 02:01:49.342
Would you please tell me if
my husband is alive or dead?

02:01:58.619 --> 02:01:59.857
Okay, hold on, now.

02:03:10.787 --> 02:03:13.337
Brendan, come on.
Let me get you home.

02:03:29.336 --> 02:03:30.806
Brendan.

02:03:31.806 --> 02:03:32.976
Brendan!

02:03:39.346 --> 02:03:41.317
- Should have been me.
- No.

02:03:43.317 --> 02:03:45.017
Yeah, he was better than me.

02:03:45.018 --> 02:03:47.754
- They were all better than me.
- No. Shh!

02:03:47.755 --> 02:03:49.424
Don't say that.

02:03:50.424 --> 02:03:52.726
Look at me. Look at me!

02:03:52.727 --> 02:03:54.665
Don't you dare do this!

02:03:57.664 --> 02:03:59.401
We can't do that.

02:04:01.401 --> 02:04:03.137
Do you understand?

02:04:09.808 --> 02:04:12.712
I'm glad that
you're alive, Brendan.

02:04:14.712 --> 02:04:16.417
Eric is, too.

02:05:29.083 --> 02:05:31.455
