you're doing?

08:33.999 --> 08:36.999
- I--I am selling salsa
to support mi abuela.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
My burro has run away.

08:38.999 --> 08:41.999
- Right, uh, whatever
this is, Mateo, I--

08:41.999 --> 08:45.999
- No Mateo.
Soy Jose!

08:45.999 --> 08:48.999
Jose was born in
a small village near Oaxaca.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
- Okay, I get it.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
I get it, I get that it's fun

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999

08:54.999 --> 08:57.999
but this is offensive.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
- Oh.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
Like, I am sorry.
I will "estop."

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
- Yes, please stop.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
- I am trying to.

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
- I'm not kidding.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999

It's like when I "estart"

I cannot "estop."

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
- That's an interesting tattoo.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
Is that a unicorn?

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
- It's a horse

09:18.999 --> 09:21.999
with a railroad spike
through his head.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999

as magical, but...

the shot already?

out of this needle.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
Okay, uh, huh.

Okay.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.999
I think this does something.

09:46.999 --> 09:47.999
Should I have a belt?

09:47.999 --> 09:50.999
- It's a tiny little needle,
all right? Just do it!

09:50.999 --> 09:53.999
- All right, uh, just,
uh, you know, breathe.

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
Or count to ten
or something like that.

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999

That's what happens

to help people out.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
- What is that?
What are you doing?

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999

I'm dating this girl.
She teaches sign language.

we can help you out.

Such a gentleman.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
- Hey, why does
she get to cut?

10:47.999 --> 10:50.999
- Because white people
help their own.

how to "espeak."

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
I cannot stop
playing the role.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.999
- It's not a role.
It's a stereotype.

11:01.999 --> 11:03.999

if I was handing out

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
what do Martin Luther King,
Malcolm X,

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
and Nelson Mandela
all have in common?

11:58.999 --> 12:03.999
Answer: They were all prominent
African-American leaders.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.999
It's okay to goof around,
but you should never--

12:06.999 --> 12:09.999

you been a racist?

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999

12:11.999 --> 12:12.999
- Me too.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
So far it's not really
working out for me.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- Hmm.
- Because when we look

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999

we learn to appreciate

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
all the colors of the cloud.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
- That sounds heavenly.

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
[MC Cool Cloud giggles]

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
- Too much.

12:33.999 --> 12:37.999
- I think if there is any
takeaway from today, it's this:

12:37.999 --> 12:42.999
anyone can be a racist.
Anyone.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
- Okay, yes,

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
I should not have done
that impression,

12:45.999 --> 12:48.999
but I want to be clear
that I was not being racist.

12:48.999 --> 12:52.999
I was making a comment
about racism.

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
- Well, yes, personally

12:54.999 --> 12:55.999
I'm not a fan of

12:55.999 --> 12:56.999

MC Cool Cloud

13:14.999 --> 13:17.000
- That's terrible.
- That makes sense.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.999
- We also need to remember

13:18.999 --> 13:21.999
that helping people
just because they're white

13:21.999 --> 13:23.999

as discriminating

- Well, he was still helping.

13:30.999 --> 13:33.999
- I was helping that lady
because she was old,

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
not because she was white.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999

racist as racism.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.999
