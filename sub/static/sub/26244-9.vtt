He stole one of my books.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.761
Interesting.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.973
A lot of ghosts are just looking
for stuff that belonged to them.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.226
What about loved ones?
Don't ghosts come back to visit them?

09:20.309 --> 09:21.519
Sometimes.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.773
But the good thing about loved ones
is they eventually die, too.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.692
Then everybody's together again.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.362
That's why the hardest thing about dying
is leaving all your stuff behind.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.155
Makes sense.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.242
Are you saying that my book
belonged to this ghost?

09:36.325 --> 09:39.954
-Was it an old book?
-Yes! It was an antique.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.747
Must be a hundred years old.

09:41.831 --> 09:46.002
Inside the cover, someone had written
"This book belongs to Craigie Williams."

09:46.085 --> 09:49.338
-Probably Craigie Williams.
-Yes, I know.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.841
I always wondered what became of him.

Sounds like he died.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.262
Yes, I know!

09:56.345 --> 10:00.975
So, the ghost of Craigie Williams
stole his book back.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.768
Now we need to figure out
where to find him.

If you're planning to do
what I think you're planning to do,

you'll need this.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.600
And this.

But be warned, you're talking
about deliberately raising the dead.

Piercing the veil
between this world and the next.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.908
Are you saying I shouldn't do it?

11:00.701 --> 11:01.911
Is it important?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.501
Quite important.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.712
Then, yeah, sure, knock yourself out.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.528
I promised her I'd fix this,
but what if we can't find the ghost?

11:35.611 --> 11:38.823
Ah, this is precisely why an elf
would never make a promise

11:38.906 --> 11:40.491
without a written document.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.661
That way, you can include disclaimers
that absolve responsibility

11:43.744 --> 11:45.913
in the event the promise cannot be upheld.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.500
But that's awful!
Why even make a promise at all?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.044
You're admitting defeat
before you even start.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.423
No, you're protecting yourself
against defeat.

-Sure. You can do it!

13:36.565 --> 13:37.399
[whimpers]

13:40.986 --> 13:42.363
[exhales]

13:42.446 --> 13:46.075
"Deep in the earth
your moldering bones for posterity lay,

13:46.575 --> 13:50.371
but on this night, they stir and moan
when you come out to play."

13:59.046 --> 13:59.880
Well, come on!

14:02.550 --> 14:03.467
[all scream]

14:11.308 --> 14:13.519
[roaring]

14:13.602 --> 14:15.187
[coughing]

14:15.271 --> 14:17.731
Wow, what's going on?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.818
[gasps] Frida, what are you doing here?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.570
[gasps] You know me?

14:22.653 --> 14:25.030
So you are the one cleaning my room!

14:25.114 --> 14:27.157
Yes, that was me.

14:27.783 --> 14:31.787
Every night I visited your room
to enjoy my favorite book,

14:31.871 --> 14:34.915
The Legend of Great King Condon.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.419
<i>Oh, reading it always</i>
<i>brought back fond memories</i>

14:38.502 --> 14:40.421
<i>of when I read it as a child.</i>

14:40.921 --> 14:45.175
<i>I was so pleased</i>
<i>that you treasured the book just as I did.</i>

14:45.801 --> 14:48.846
<i>To show my appreciation</i>
<i>for you</i> <i>keeping it safe,</i>

14:48.929 --> 14:51.974
I cleaned the room for you every night.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.768
Then what? You got tired of that
and took the book for yourself?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.312
Certainly not!

14:56.395 --> 14:59.565
I was cross when I saw it was gone.

14:59.648 --> 15:03.652
But without it there,
I had no reason to return.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.322
Right. Is there anyone else
who wanted it?

15:06.906 --> 15:07.740
Um...

15:08.324 --> 15:09.742
[gasps] Ooh!

15:10.826 --> 15:13.579
Engilbjort! It's your brother!

15:15.456 --> 15:16.457
[gasps]

15:18.000 --> 15:20.085
Did you steal my old book?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.547
-What's it to you, Craigie?
-I knew it!

15:23.631 --> 15:26.800
You always were jealous of my books.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.303
It's not fair.
They were all passed down to you.

15:29.386 --> 15:33.223
-That collection was worth a fortune.
-I was the reader in the family!

15:33.307 --> 15:36.477
Bah! Mother and Father
always liked you best, that's all!

15:36.560 --> 15:37.394
[Hilda] Excuse me.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.648
I don't want to get in the middle
of your whole, uh, thing here,

15:40.731 --> 15:42.274
but we need to get that book back.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.444
-And who are you?
-The rightful owners.

15:45.527 --> 15:49.031
[laughing] Oh, well, we'll see about that!

15:49.615 --> 15:51.867
Do you wish to challenge me?

15:52.493 --> 15:53.994
Um... [whimpering]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.622
Yes. We all do.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.042
Excellent! A wrestling match for the book!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.670
[groans] Don't tell me that.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.631
A dispute with a ghost
can only be settled by...

16:05.714 --> 16:07.299
a wrestling match?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.927
What? We need the entertainment!

16:12.554 --> 16:14.223
[rumbling, crash]

16:14.306 --> 16:15.140
[growls]

16:18.352 --> 16:19.853

16:20.688 --> 16:23.107
[ghosts chanting]
Engilbjort! Engilbjort! Engilbjort!

16:23.190 --> 16:25.943
-[chanting continues]
-Engilbjort!

16:26.026 --> 16:29.613
-Why did you have to include us?
-Sorry.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.241
We need to work together
if we're to have a chance.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.159
And you have a wrestling badge.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.537
We need every advantage we can get here.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.290
Engilbjort's a grown-up.
Or, you know, she was.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.042
[chanting continues]

16:42.126 --> 16:43.669
Ready?

16:43.752 --> 16:45.546
[gulps] I suppose.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.843
Now remember, keep it clean.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.429
Three, two, one...

16:53.512 --> 16:55.014
[whistle blows]

16:57.349 --> 16:58.976
[all grunting]

17:01.020 --> 17:02.688

[David whimpering]

17:06.650 --> 17:07.484
[roars]

17:07.568 --> 17:09.361
Hey, that's cheating!

17:09.445 --> 17:10.404
[whistle blows]

17:10.487 --> 17:12.489
Engilbjort, that's a warning.

17:12.573 --> 17:16.243
[ghosts booing and hissing]

17:16.326 --> 17:18.912
Hey, ghosts do say "boo."

17:19.913 --> 17:21.832
[grunts]

17:21.915 --> 17:24.585
-Ah! [moans]
-The boy is out!

17:24.668 --> 17:25.878
[ghosts cheering]

17:30.507 --> 17:32.134

[laughs]

17:54.698 --> 17:57.409
[both grunting]

17:58.327 --> 18:00.079
The girl is out!

18:03.082 --> 18:03.916
Ah!

18:05.125 --> 18:06.502
[echoing] You can do it, Hilda.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.341
[exhales]

18:12.424 --> 18:15.469
Ah!

18:17.429 --> 18:18.305

18:22.267 --> 18:23.268
Ah!

-[whistle blows]
-[ghosts cheering]

18:25.896 --> 18:28.982
-The winner!
-[ghosts cheering]

18:31.860 --> 18:32.861
Hey!

18:36.281 --> 18:39.451
-But she cheated!
-Look, kid, it's almost sunrise.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.538
We gotta wrap this up
and get back in the ground.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.789
Bye.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.171
Frida, don't give up.
There's always something we can do.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.341
Aha.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.219
[panting, grunts]

18:57.302 --> 18:59.138
Hey! What are you doing?

18:59.221 --> 19:02.099
I'm lying on your grave
so your bones can't get in.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.642
Give us Craigie's book!

19:03.725 --> 19:06.520
This isn't fair. I won.

19:06.603 --> 19:10.816
But you also have to be back
in the ground by sunrise, don't you?

19:12.276 --> 19:14.653
Me, I can lie here all morning.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.282
Sure is great not being dead.

19:20.951 --> 19:21.952
[huffs]

19:22.578 --> 19:23.412
Here you are.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.374
-Thank you.
-You did it! You did it!

19:27.457 --> 19:30.043
You got <i>The-- The Squire's Folly?</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:32.754
This is the wrong book!

19:32.838 --> 19:34.339
That's the one I stole.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.050
I don't know anything
about any other book.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.933
I don't suppose you'd consider
coming to clean my room anyway?

19:45.517 --> 19:49.104
What am I? The ghost of a maid? Ha!

19:49.188 --> 19:50.689
[grumbling]

19:54.401 --> 19:56.403
[birds chirping]

19:57.070 --> 19:58.030
Frida.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.823
I'm so sorry.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.745
[sighs]

20:08.832 --> 20:09.875
I failed Frida.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.044
I'm a bad friend.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.463
Nonsense!
You're an excellent friend.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.466
There's none better.
Should you have included a disclaimer?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.718
Well, of course, you should always
include a disclaimer.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.596
But she'll be all right in the end.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.557
Ugh! This corpse frost
does not want to come off!

20:29.061 --> 20:30.062
[mic feedback rings]

20:30.145 --> 20:34.775
And now, your next candidate
for class president...

20:34.858 --> 20:36.610
-Frida!
-[applause]

20:36.693 --> 20:38.946
How is she going to handle the speech?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.657
She's strong. She'll be all right.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.533
I hope so.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.287
Frida?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.707
Has anyone see Frida today?

20:53.543 --> 20:56.463
[door squeaks open]

20:57.214 --> 21:00.342
I don't know what's the matter.
Maybe you can talk to her.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.805
Frida, it's just a messy room.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.099
[sighs] No, it's everything!

21:07.182 --> 21:09.476
My parents think I'm perfect.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.478
It's really quite important to them.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.939
To be honest, it's important to me, too.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.734
If I'm not perfect,
then I don't know who I am.

21:19.903 --> 21:24.950
Look, I don't know who took that book,
but you don't need it or the ghost.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.118
You're still you.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.203
Still our friend.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.329
Oh, really?

21:30.038 --> 21:33.041
A friend to David
who won't stop poking fun at me.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.585
And a friend to you
who builds up my hopes for nothing!

21:36.545 --> 21:39.464
You know, you're not making it easy
to be your friend right now.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.508
You think it's easy being your friend?

21:42.092 --> 21:44.303
I'd say I'm pretty low-maintenance
compared to you.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.723
Ha! Well, I don't drag people
into dangerous situations

21:47.806 --> 21:49.099
just for the fun of it.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.726
Well, at least I know how to have fun.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.353
Right, because you're
the cool wilderness girl,

21:53.437 --> 21:55.188
all free-spirited and everything.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.066
You think you're too good to play
by the rules just like the rest of us.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.193
Hey, I wrestled a ghost for you.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.572
We all wrestled the ghost
because you told me

22:03.655 --> 22:04.948
it would get my book back.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.366
But it didn't, did it?

22:06.867 --> 22:11.079
It was just a horrible, terrifying thing
we all had to do for no reason.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.373
Fine. Sorry I ever tried to help.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.084
I'm sorry you ever moved here!

22:16.168 --> 22:17.169
[gasps]

22:19.588 --> 22:21.506
Come on, David. Let's go.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.968
You could just learn to tidy
your own flipping room!

22:25.594 --> 22:26.678
He's not wrong.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.388
Ugh! Just go!

22:30.724 --> 22:31.558
[exhales]

22:41.985 --> 22:43.862
[theme music playing]
