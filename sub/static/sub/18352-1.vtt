WEBVTT

00:26.287 --> 00:28.419
Is everyone there?

00:28.506 --> 00:31.509
Great. I'’ll see you guys
at the airport.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.036
[ding]

00:43.217 --> 00:46.350
Uh, hey, lady,
where you headed?

00:46.437 --> 00:48.874
I'’m getting a husband
for Christmas.

01:18.382 --> 01:21.690
[piano playing
"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"]

01:21.777 --> 01:23.779
Can you believe all this?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.912
I actually can'’t believe
Mr. Rawlings invited me.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.349
Don'’t worry about it.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
I'’ve been his assistant
15 years.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.962
This is only the third time
I'’ve been invited.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.833
There'’s a lot of people here
I don'’t know.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.449
There'’s Barry Kane.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.320
- Barry--
- No, no, no, don'’t look.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.409
- Don'’t look.
- Oh, okay, not looking.

01:45.496 --> 01:46.976
He'’s the CFO of Onway.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.847
Onway Media Branding?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.893
- Yes.
- Wow.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.590
We'’re merging. I know it.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.114
Oh, there'’s gonna be
a bloodletting.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.507
That'’s kind of harsh,
isn'’t it?

01:56.594 --> 01:59.771
Fifteen years.
Fifteen years I'’ve been here.

01:59.858 --> 02:03.166
You'’d think I'’d get a promotion.
Instead I'’m getting an ulcer.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.261
Hey, hey, hey!

02:11.348 --> 02:12.958
I am so sorry.
Oh, wow.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.831
Let me go get something
at the bar, and I'’ll get it out.

02:15.918 --> 02:16.962
I'’ll be right back.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.575
Club soda, please.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.925
Lady, there'’s a line.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.884
Uh... Ohh...

02:25.971 --> 02:28.626
Just one minute, one second,
one second, okay?

02:35.242 --> 02:37.331
Club soda.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.289
Excuse me?

02:39.376 --> 02:41.248
It will get anything out.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.423
Oh.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.946
Thanks.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.645
Nice party.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.430
Yes.

02:49.517 --> 02:53.695
Christmas has always been
my favorite time of year.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.871
It'’s all right.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.481
Roger Burkett.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.875
Oh. Brooke Harris.

02:59.962 --> 03:03.966
So how long have you hated
Christmas, Brooke Harris?

03:04.053 --> 03:06.403
I don'’t hate Christmas.
It'’s just--

03:06.490 --> 03:09.580
Is "dislike" more apropos?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.060
No.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.844
"Indifferent?"

03:12.931 --> 03:14.846
What are you, a copywriter?

03:14.933 --> 03:16.108
Graphic designer.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.202
And you work for Onway?

03:22.289 --> 03:26.075
Well, I hope to be working
for Rawlings soon.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.426
So there is a merger.

03:29.513 --> 03:33.343
Oh, that'’s the word
on the streets.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.867
Who do you work for?

03:35.954 --> 03:37.782
Rawlings.

03:37.869 --> 03:38.914
Oh.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.833
Richard--
Mr. Rawlings--

03:44.920 --> 03:48.706
he'’s a wonderful man and,
as I'’m sure you know,

03:48.793 --> 03:52.319
seems to be
quite a terrific company.

03:52.406 --> 03:56.758
I just hope everything
works out with the H-1B.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.802
What'’s that?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.369
My work visa.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.763
Oh, I thought the company
took care of that.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.896
No, not if they can hire
an American just as easily,

04:04.983 --> 04:07.986
or in this case,
already has the job.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.119
You don'’t say.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.774
So what do you do
for Rawlings?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.994
I'’m a graphic designer.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.910
I see.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.476
Club soda, please.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.001
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.917
Your accent'’s nice.
It'’s, uh...

04:26.004 --> 04:28.442
- British.
- British. Oh.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.009
- It is nice meeting you, Roger.
- Likewise.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.141
Thank you.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.802
I'’ll take the whole bottle.

04:57.732 --> 04:58.646
[phone chimes]

04:58.733 --> 05:00.909
Oh, God.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.303
What, Mother?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.956
Brooke, it'’s your mother.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.958
I just wanted to see
if you changed your mind

05:07.045 --> 05:08.830
about Christmas dinner.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.180
Your father and I
would love to see you.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.530
Tracy and David
will be there, too.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.967
They'’re engaged.
Can you believe it?

05:16.054 --> 05:17.926
Your little sister'’s
getting married.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.884
Mm-hmm.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.539
Now, I don'’t want you
to tie yourself into knots.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.846
You'’ll find someone soon,
darling.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.545
Oh, Mom.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.817
Brooke,
for the bajillionth time,

05:39.904 --> 05:41.558
they'’re not gonna fire you.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.994
You were just
telling me last week

05:43.081 --> 05:44.474
how much they were
loving you.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.563
I didn'’t say "loving me."

05:46.650 --> 05:50.306
What about that job offer,
the one in New York?

05:50.393 --> 05:52.221
I passed.

05:52.308 --> 05:55.659
Brooke, you passed it up?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.619
Oh, my God. You got to get over
your fear of flying.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.838
Well, maybe
I don'’t want to move.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.579
Look, I love California.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.016
I just need to find
a better place.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.584
What about that condo you said
you liked? The one downtown.

06:07.671 --> 06:11.414
You mean the one that'’s
way out of my price range?

06:11.501 --> 06:14.069
Brooke, I think that you'’re
looking at this all wrong.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.114
Maybe this merger
is a good thing.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.640
Not if they'’ve already brought
in your replacement on a visa.

06:19.727 --> 06:20.684
How do you know that?

06:20.771 --> 06:22.947
He told me at the party.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.515
You met the guy that they'’re
going to replace you with?

06:25.602 --> 06:27.648
Well, I'’m not sure,

06:27.735 --> 06:31.303
but he does work for Onway,
and he'’s a graphic designer.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.304
Do the math.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.741
Where is he from?

06:33.828 --> 06:35.133
He said England.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.221
Is he cute?

06:36.308 --> 06:38.093
No.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.487
Maybe. He'’s all right.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.314
You like him.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.620
What?

06:43.707 --> 06:46.362
I can tell,
even over the phone.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.669
You got a lousy
poker voice, girl.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.193
I barely even know him,
Amanda.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.109
He'’s a real life
Prince Charming.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.981
Just because he'’s British
doesn'’t make him a prince.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.505
Maybe you'’ll get married, too.

06:58.592 --> 06:59.854
Too?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.551
Is there something
I don'’t know?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.901
Well...

07:03.988 --> 07:07.514
not yet,
but it'’s gonna happen soon.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.167
Really?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.779
Well, it didn'’t happen
at our anniversary,

07:11.866 --> 07:13.998
and then it didn'’t happen
on our weekend getaway,

07:14.085 --> 07:17.524
so the only other option
is that he'’s gonna propose

07:17.611 --> 07:21.266
under the tree on Christmas.

07:21.353 --> 07:24.792
Oh, God, I can barely
handle the suspense.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.577
- Ah. That makes two of us.
- You said that he was cute.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.406
Girl, would you stop it?
I gotta go. Bye.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.278
Too much.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.940
- Good morning, Florence.
- Hi, Brooke.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.942
Here is your extra-large
vanilla latte.

07:45.029 --> 07:45.987
Thank you.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.858
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:49.512 --> 07:52.776
Hey, Natasha, I have got
your espresso,

07:52.863 --> 07:56.301
and for Mr. Rawlings,
a medium half-caff hazelnut

07:56.388 --> 07:58.782
with whip,
no foam or caramel drizzle.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.436
Thank you.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.439
[whispers] Could you
tell him it'’s from me?

08:03.526 --> 08:06.660
Brooke Harris,
you are one impressive beast.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.792
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.930
Five years. All they'’re offering
is two weeks'’ severance.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.671
It'’s Christmas.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.500
Who'’s gonna even look
at a resume before January?

08:23.111 --> 08:24.939
Brooke.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.376
Yes, Natasha.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.205
Mr. Rawlings would like
to see you in his office.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.381
I'’ll be right there.

08:42.870 --> 08:43.871
Good luck.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.786
Thanks.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.180
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Rawlings?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.355
Beth!

08:50.442 --> 08:53.097
- Brooke.
- Have a seat.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.665
Okay.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.319
I'’ve been looking over
some of your designs,

08:57.406 --> 09:00.365
and I want you to know
how thrilled I am

09:00.452 --> 09:01.932
with the work
you'’ve been doing for us.

09:02.019 --> 09:02.933
Thank you.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.848
Now, as you may have heard,

09:04.935 --> 09:07.068
I made a deal to merge this
company with an outside firm.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.809
Onway.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.594
Unfortunately,
as with all transitions,

09:11.681 --> 09:13.553
there will need to be some
changes around the office,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.163
and with budgets
being what they are,

09:15.250 --> 09:18.079
we simply cannot afford
redundancies in our departments.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.515
Are you with me?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.038
Yes.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.692
I want you to know
we spent a lot of time

09:22.779 --> 09:24.694
discussing what the best
course of action would be,

09:24.781 --> 09:27.131
regarding your employment
with us.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.787
- Yes?
- And...

09:30.874 --> 09:32.746
And we decided
to double your salary

09:32.833 --> 09:34.443
and promote you
to vice president.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.184
Huh?

09:36.271 --> 09:38.795
The truth is you'’re one
of the best designers we have,

09:38.882 --> 09:42.625
and it'’s time to have you
overseeing your own projects.

09:42.712 --> 09:46.063
I thought
you were gonna fire me.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.936
Fire you?
Darling, you'’re irreplaceable.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.026
There'’s a very talented
graphic designer from Onway

09:52.113 --> 09:53.854
that we want you to oversee.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.204
A fantastic talent
out of London.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.640
Roger Burkett.

09:57.727 --> 09:58.641
You know him?

09:58.728 --> 10:01.165
Yes. We met at the party.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.951
Do me a favor.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.823
Look at his work.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.436
Ooh, nice.
Roger painted these?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.743
His work has won
several awards.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.572
Oh, so then you solved
his problem.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.095
Problem?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.837
His problem with immigration.

10:20.924 --> 10:24.406
Actually, you see,
in the old days,

10:24.493 --> 10:28.018
the job technically would be
enough to clear the visa

10:28.105 --> 10:30.325
and push the paperwork
right through,

10:30.412 --> 10:32.980
but lately that kind of thing
has gotten a little more tricky.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.546
Really?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.549
However,
hypothetically speaking,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.508
if Roger were to meet
a nice American citizen

10:39.595 --> 10:41.336
and get married,

10:41.423 --> 10:44.600
he could stay in the country,
work for us, no questions asked.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.994
I'’m sorry, I don'’t follow.

10:47.081 --> 10:51.259
You told Natasha that you guys
hit it off at the party, right?

10:51.346 --> 10:54.784
That'’s not exactly what I said.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.873
He'’d have his citizenship,
I'’d have my designer,

10:56.960 --> 10:59.876
and you, young lady,
would have your promotion.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.574
You'’re not seriously
asking me to--

11:02.662 --> 11:04.576
I'’m not asking you
to do anything.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.404
Kinda sounded like it.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.624
I was simply pointing out that
if some intelligent, driven,

11:08.711 --> 11:11.714
work-minded single woman
would happen to marry Roger,

11:11.801 --> 11:14.325
all our problems
would be solved.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.285
Think of it as a Christmas gift
to all of us.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.895
I just don'’t know
how I feel.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.637
- The thing is, Beth--
- Brooke.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.944
I can'’t promote you
if I can'’t replace you,

11:24.031 --> 11:26.207
and if I can'’t do that,
well, like I said,

11:26.294 --> 11:28.905
there will need to be some
changes around the office.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.081
You want some time
to think about it?

11:31.168 --> 11:33.040
The thing is--

11:33.127 --> 11:35.085
Take tonight to think about it,
but let me know by morning

11:35.172 --> 11:37.044
because I have
a 9:00 conference call

11:37.131 --> 11:38.828
to discuss reorganization.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.743
Is that all right with you,
darling?

11:40.830 --> 11:42.136
Sure.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.312
Get out of here.
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.575
Okay, Mr. Rawlings.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.890
Well?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.326
Oh, that bad?

11:58.413 --> 11:59.631
He offered me a promotion.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.155
A promotion? Really?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
Vice president.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.288
What'’d you say?

12:04.375 --> 12:06.160
Well, I said I'’d have
to think about it.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.771
Natasha, get the Anderson file
for me, would you?

12:08.858 --> 12:10.991
Yes, Mr. Rawlings,
right away.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.732
Excuse me.

12:15.996 --> 12:19.695
Wait, you mean like marry him,
marry him, like for real?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.697
Of course I'’m not going to.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.047
I guess I just gotta start
looking for another job.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.006
I'’m sure there'’s
a lot of companies hiring

12:26.093 --> 12:27.877
right before Christmas.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.488
Oh, that'’s the one
you really wanted.

12:30.575 --> 12:35.276
City view, 2,000 square feet,
excellent shopping area.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.192
There will be other places.

12:38.279 --> 12:42.283
I know.
I just really wanted that one.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.373
Brooke!

12:45.460 --> 12:46.591
Brooke Harris!

12:46.678 --> 12:47.679
Is that you?

12:47.767 --> 12:48.680
Erin?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.639
Hey, girlfriend, hey!

12:50.726 --> 12:52.684
Come on down!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.949
[sighs]
Wait till you meet this one.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.780
Erin!
It'’s so good to see you.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.347
Looking good, girlfriend.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.653
This is my husband Nick.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.089
Husband?

13:06.176 --> 13:08.831
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.877
- This is my girlfriend Amanda.
- Hi.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.574
Erin and I used to--

13:12.661 --> 13:13.967
We went to college together.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.447
Brooke was
"most likely to succeed."

13:16.534 --> 13:17.492
Yeah.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.754
What are you up to now?

13:18.841 --> 13:20.625
- Well, you know.
- Succeeding.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.628
Oh, well, we'’re just saying
goodbye to our old place.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.761
- Old place?
- Mm-hmm. We'’re moving.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.458
- Cherry Hills.
- Big house.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.417
Five-bedroom.
You should see the pool.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.898
It'’s beautiful!
We'’re gonna redo the gazebo.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.421
- And tennis court.
- Uh-huh!

13:33.508 --> 13:35.684
You should come over sometime.
Give me a call.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.947
- Sounds nice.
- I started my own business.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.427
Did you see the write-up
in Wired?

13:39.514 --> 13:41.516
So you started
your own business,

13:41.603 --> 13:44.258
you'’re in magazines,
and y'’all got a tennis court.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.217
Hey, you know,
Venus and Serena.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.306
Well, nice to meet you ladies.
We gotta go.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.135
All right, nice meeting you.
Good seeing you, Erin.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.571
Bye.

13:55.443 --> 13:58.098
Most likely to succeed, huh?

13:58.185 --> 14:01.057
I mean, you did meet
this Roger person.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.276
You did say
that he was cute.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.886
Amanda!

14:03.973 --> 14:05.366
Hey, just thinking
out loud here.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.935
But if you did marry him,
then, you know,

14:09.022 --> 14:12.155
you would get your promotion,
you would get your better place.

14:12.242 --> 14:15.158
In five years, maybe you could
have your own tennis court.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.640
Very funny. You'’re starting
to sound like Mr. Rawlings.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.599
50% of marriages
end in divorce anyway, right?

14:21.686 --> 14:23.863
So if your first one
doesn'’t work out,

14:23.950 --> 14:27.649
then doesn'’t that give your
second one a better chance?

14:27.736 --> 14:30.173
Statistically speaking.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.566
Right.

14:41.968 --> 14:42.882
Whew!

14:45.580 --> 14:47.016
What a day.

Mr. Rawlings, it'’s Brooke.

Oh! Are you okay?

15:37.893 --> 15:41.679
I think so. I might'’ve
stubbed my pride though.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.290
Fix your shirt.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.813
Thanks.

15:44.900 --> 15:45.857
Brooke Harris.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.556
I remember you.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.602
You do?
I mean, of course you do.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.822
I remember you too,
obviously.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.783
Roger, um...

15:58.870 --> 16:01.525
- Burkett.
- Right.

16:01.612 --> 16:05.486
You should remember that.
It'’s going to be your last name.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.357
Sorry. Bad joke.

16:07.444 --> 16:11.971
Look, can we just agree
that this is a means to an end,

16:12.058 --> 16:13.711
a little extra paperwork?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.409
Quite the romantic.

16:15.496 --> 16:18.281
You can get your job,
I'’ll get my promotion.

16:18.368 --> 16:21.893
It'’s a little extra
Christmas gift for both of us.

16:21.981 --> 16:28.248
Let'’s agree right now
not to complicate things, okay?

16:28.335 --> 16:30.206
- Fine.
- Fine.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.425
Will you marry me?

16:31.512 --> 16:33.079
You betcha. Let'’s go.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.345
Ooh! That'’s...

16:38.432 --> 16:39.476

Ah! Perfect.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.005
Oh, you shouldn'’t have.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.269
There you have it.
You'’re officially married.

16:49.356 --> 16:52.098
Congratulations.
You may kiss the bride.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.751
That'’s okay.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.840
I'’m good.

16:55.927 --> 16:56.972
Merry Christmas.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.018
Merry Christmas.
Mm-hmm.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.805
And here'’s your check.

17:03.892 --> 17:04.935
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.199
You don'’t have to do that.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.462
- Oh, no, I insist.
- No, really.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.247
Look, the least I could do is
pay for the wedding reception.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.815
[laughs]

17:13.902 --> 17:16.035
You know, I never pictured
my wedding day

17:16.122 --> 17:17.992
to be quite like this.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.603
It'’s kinda weird,
isn'’t it?

17:19.690 --> 17:23.781
Mm. My girlfriend would
certainly agree with you.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.131
You have a girlfriend?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.394
And now a wife.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.874
Quite the modern man,
aren'’t I?

17:29.961 --> 17:34.314
It'’s just that you think you
would'’ve mentioned something.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.795
You said yourself.
It'’s not real.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.494
It'’s a signature
on a piece of paper.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.410
But still, um...

17:45.803 --> 17:48.545
How does she feel
about all this, hmm?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.721
I think she'’ll understand.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.377
She doesn'’t know,
does she?

17:56.292 --> 17:57.250
Not yet.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.860
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17:58.947 --> 18:02.472
But I imagine, um...

18:02.559 --> 18:05.562
she'’ll feel the same way
your boyfriend would feel,

18:05.649 --> 18:07.651
if you had one.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.001
And what makes you think
I don'’t have a boyfriend.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.962
Well, don'’t get me wrong.

18:14.049 --> 18:17.052
I appreciate everything
that you'’ve been doing for me,

18:17.139 --> 18:20.795
but I just assumed,
under the circumstances,

18:20.882 --> 18:24.451
that you just didn'’t have
anything going on in that area.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.845
Oh, I have plenty going on
in that area.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.456
- Oh?
- Yes.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.066
I have so much going on

18:31.153 --> 18:33.721
that I can barely
keep track.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.418
Oh, brilliant.

18:37.290 --> 18:42.686
So this girlfriend of yours,
is she here or London?

18:42.773 --> 18:44.471
Burnley, actually.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.952
It'’s about 400 kilometers
north of London.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.040
Nice place?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.478
Oh, it'’s beautiful.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.915
Simple. Working class.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.831
My heart will always be there,

18:56.918 --> 19:01.792
but I'’ve always wanted
to spread my wings,

exciting new things--

19:04.969 --> 19:06.493

19:06.580 --> 19:08.843
Ah, and now you can.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.932
Thanks to you.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.893
Right!
Time for a wedding selfie.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.852
A what?

19:17.939 --> 19:20.333
Think of all the money we'’ll
save on a wedding photographer.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.551
Oh!

19:21.638 --> 19:23.074

19:29.864 --> 19:31.648
It was fun.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.434
Yes, yes, it was.

19:34.521 --> 19:38.264
So, uh, I guess
I'’ll see you around, huh?

19:38.351 --> 19:39.743
Sure.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.704
Uh, Brooke?

19:43.791 --> 19:45.053
Yes, Roger.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.620
It is our wedding night.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.319
I'’ll see you at work.

to be able to make it back

21:19.278 --> 21:21.497
to England for Christmas.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.152
I'’ve just got too much
going on.

I don'’t know how long
I'’ll be staying in America.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.460
How is married life anyway?

22:11.547 --> 22:13.288
Oh, it'’s perfect.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.290
All I need now is
to get a divorce,

22:15.377 --> 22:17.945
so I can find Mr. Right.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.556
Maybe I should take
one of those single cruises.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.690
That'’s a great idea.
That'’s how I met Ryan.

22:23.777 --> 22:27.171
Amanda, I was kidding.
It'’s not a great idea.

22:27.258 --> 22:30.218
I need you to imagine
an entire ship

22:30.305 --> 22:35.310
filled with hot, single guys
and unlimited booze.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.878
Mmm. Now that you
put it that way...

22:37.965 --> 22:40.620
Best of all, you wouldn'’t even
have to set foot on a plane.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.405
I mean, who knows?
You might meet somebody.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.102
If your husband doesn'’t mind.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.670
He already has a girlfriend.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.107
Then it'’s perfect.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.153
When am I gonna meet
this hubby anyway?

22:52.240 --> 22:55.635
You do understand
that it'’s not real, right?

22:55.722 --> 22:57.419
Because it'’s for a job?

22:57.506 --> 22:59.900
Would it kill you to have
a little fun in the process?

22:59.987 --> 23:02.468
Bye, Amanda.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.732
Excuse me, young lady,
but it sounds to me

23:05.819 --> 23:08.778
like your friend hasn'’t caught
the Christmas spirit yet.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.781
Oh, don'’t get me wrong.
She'’s terrific.

23:11.868 --> 23:15.176
It'’s just sometimes I just wish
that she could just let herself

23:15.263 --> 23:17.352
fall in love, you know?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.354
But that would be
a Christmas miracle.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.878
Well, isn'’t Christmas
the time for miracles?

23:21.965 --> 23:23.532
[sighs]

23:23.619 --> 23:25.578
No offense, Santa Claus,

23:25.665 --> 23:28.972
but I think that this miracle
might be a little much,

23:29.059 --> 23:30.800
even for you.

23:34.369 --> 23:37.198
Then I guess
I better get to work.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.896
You see, we'’re selling
a whole new mindset.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.985
"Fresher than fresh."

23:42.072 --> 23:43.813
These mockups are amazing.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.469
We got a new graphic designer.
He'’s from London.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.253
I love it!

23:49.340 --> 23:52.343
He'’s really talented.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.216
He is, isn'’t he?

23:55.303 --> 23:57.174
We'’ll be in touch.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.438
I look forward to it.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.918
You know, I'’m happy
they promoted you, Brooke.

24:02.005 --> 24:06.270
I feel our campaign'’s
in good hands.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.751
Thank you.
I appreciate the support.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.710
- We'’ll talk soon.
- Yes.

24:11.972 --> 24:15.758
[laughter]

24:15.845 --> 24:18.326
You are hilarious.
Hilarious!

24:18.413 --> 24:19.632
You'’re encouraging me.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.372
Oh, hey.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.331
You know what is so weird

24:23.418 --> 24:25.507
is why didn'’t you tell me that
you and Roger knew each other?

24:25.594 --> 24:30.164
Um, we didn'’t wanna tip off
human resources, you know.

24:30.251 --> 24:33.254
Kind of a lucky break,
wouldn'’t you say?

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
I mean, if you hadn'’t
gotten married,

24:35.474 --> 24:37.214
then you wouldn'’t have
gotten his job,

24:37.301 --> 24:39.086
and you wouldn'’t have
gotten promoted.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.264
Like you said, lucky us.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.876
Yeah, well, I'’m just so happy
to be around all this true love.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.312
Uh-huh.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.184
I'’ll see you around.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.283
Beth.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.806
Mr. Rawlings.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.504
I'’m not interrupting anything,
am I?

25:05.591 --> 25:09.464
No, not at all.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.858
And, sir, it'’s Brooke.

25:11.945 --> 25:12.902
What is?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.600
My name.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.819
- Is it?
- Yes.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.386
I like Beth.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.388
You know, it kind of
rolls off the tongue.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.911
It is nice.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.566
Not a bad office, huh?

25:24.653 --> 25:26.960
And the clients all love
your husband, by the way.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.181
So...

25:31.268 --> 25:33.793
how is married life
treating you?

25:33.880 --> 25:34.924
It'’s fine.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.317
Just fine?

25:36.404 --> 25:38.928
What were you expecting?

25:39.015 --> 25:42.366
Well, I saw the way
he was looking at you.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.499
When?

25:44.586 --> 25:45.935
Just now.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.416
Hmm. He was looking at me?

25:48.503 --> 25:50.766
Yeah. I thought there would be
a few sparks

25:50.853 --> 25:52.463
between the two of you.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.205
I mean, it can'’t be all work,
right?

25:55.292 --> 26:00.471
Look, I'’ll admit,
he'’s talented,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.343
but he'’s got a girlfriend.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.476
Well, maybe you should think
about marriage counseling.

26:05.564 --> 26:10.090
[giggles]
I'’m sorry. That was a bad joke.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.701
But you are bringing him
to the Christmas party tonight?

26:12.788 --> 26:14.573
Oh, my gosh,
is that tonight?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.226
It could be a nice date.

26:16.313 --> 26:19.795
I got a lot on my plate.
I mean, you know.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.581
Look, no one outside
the three of us

26:22.668 --> 26:25.758
knows anything about
our little arrangement.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.108
- Mum'’s the word.
- I'’m just saying.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.850
Wouldn'’t be a bad idea
to keep up appearances,

26:30.937 --> 26:33.287
if you catch my drift.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.158
Consider it caught.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.638
I want you to know
that you will see

26:36.725 --> 26:38.292
an appropriate expression
of my gratitude

26:38.379 --> 26:39.685
in your bonus this year.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.817
Thank you, sir.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.950
You'’re welcome, doll.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.430
Get some decorations in here.
It'’s Christmas.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.609
You got it, Mr. Rawlings.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.529
[line ringing]

26:58.617 --> 27:00.880
Immigration services.
How may I help you?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.709
Yes, who do I speak to
if I want to report a fraud?

27:03.796 --> 27:06.102
Let me put you through.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.854
Now where do I start?

27:20.987 --> 27:22.336
[knocking]

27:23.685 --> 27:24.599
Mrs. Burkett?

27:26.122 --> 27:29.082
I think you have
the wrong unit.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.650
Uh, Mrs. Brooke Burkett?

27:31.737 --> 27:35.218
Oh, Burkett, yes, that'’s me.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.177
Well, the door was open.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.483
I'’m Agent Nathan Hedge.
This is Agent Marie Adams.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.747
We just want to ask you and
your husband a few questions.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.444
My husband?

27:43.531 --> 27:46.752
My husband'’s not here yet.
Is there a problem?

27:46.839 --> 27:49.363
Like he said, we just wanna
ask you a few questions.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.538
Sure.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.629
Well, you'’re a lucky woman,
Mrs. Burkett.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.718
I would love to have a condo
like this.

27:56.805 --> 28:00.243
Sorry about the mess.
We just moved in.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.115
What'’s this about?

28:02.202 --> 28:04.117
We received a call.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.771
A call?

28:05.858 --> 28:08.599
It'’s just departmental policy
to follow up.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.600
Of course.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.819
The lease on this condo

28:10.906 --> 28:12.995
only has one renter'’s name.

28:13.082 --> 28:16.738
Well, Roger, my husband,
he'’s from out of the country,

28:16.825 --> 28:19.523
so we just thought
it would be best

28:19.610 --> 28:21.351
to use my name on the lease.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.267
Uh-huh. Tell you what.
Why don'’t we give him a call?

28:24.354 --> 28:26.792
You mean now?

28:26.879 --> 28:28.358
Please.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.144
Excuse me!

28:31.231 --> 28:33.494
I have my rights.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.278
Would you like me
to read them to you?

28:35.365 --> 28:37.759
- You can'’t just--
- Everyone is a little testy,

28:37.846 --> 28:40.893
as I'’m sure you can understand,
with Christmas coming.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.417
We just want to get
this little matter cleared up

28:43.504 --> 28:44.592
as soon as possible.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.420
I understand.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.378
So where is Mr. Burkett?

28:48.465 --> 28:51.425
He'’s, uh, probably at work.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.340
We work pretty late.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.037
So you work together.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.735
Yes?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.477
Is that a question?

29:00.564 --> 29:03.176
No, I mean, yes.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.307
We work together.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.396
Is that where you met?

29:06.483 --> 29:09.965
No, not at work.
Before work.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.053
Long before that.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.707
Where'’d you meet?

29:12.794 --> 29:15.710
A singles cruise.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.278
With Roger being
from out of the country,

29:18.365 --> 29:21.629
we vacation a lot
out of the country.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.892
- Uh-huh.
- Tell you what.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.286
Why don'’t you just
give your husband a call

29:26.373 --> 29:28.592
and find out
what time he'’ll be back.

29:28.679 --> 29:31.378
Yeah, I'’ll give him a call.
I'’ll try him at the office.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.253
[dialing]

29:37.340 --> 29:40.343
[line ringing]

29:40.430 --> 29:43.738
Oh, voicemail.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.784
Why don'’t you try his cell?

29:47.394 --> 29:50.353
He dropped it in the bathtub
this morning.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.486
You know, newlyweds,
marital bliss?

29:52.573 --> 29:54.575
Let me cut to the chase.

29:54.662 --> 29:58.231
In our experience, sometimes
two people enter a marriage

29:58.318 --> 30:01.582
in order to grant
one of the parties citizenship,

30:01.669 --> 30:05.151
in which case, the marriage is,
in fact, not real.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.762
People do that?
You'’re kidding.

30:07.849 --> 30:08.981
So dishonest.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.765
Not to mention highly illegal.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.115
It'’s called marriage fraud,
and it'’s a felony.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.988
AGENT HEDGE:
Look, Mrs. Burkett,

30:16.075 --> 30:18.686
all we want to do is evaluate
if you and your husband

30:18.773 --> 30:20.514
actually plan on sharing
a life together,

30:20.601 --> 30:22.081
or if he simply got married

30:22.168 --> 30:23.996
to evade the proper
immigration procedures.

30:25.736 --> 30:26.737
I understand.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.522
We'’ll be back on Monday.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.393
Monday'’s Christmas Eve.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.570
At which time you and
your husband must be present,

30:33.657 --> 30:35.137
or there will be consequences.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.227
Roger and I will be here.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.750
Have a good day.

30:41.274 --> 30:42.710
You too.

30:51.023 --> 30:52.285
[typing]

30:52.372 --> 30:53.721
Come on.

31:01.555 --> 31:04.166
Five years in jail?

31:37.852 --> 31:39.898
- Lady, how about the keys?
- Oh, here you go!

31:44.990 --> 31:47.383
Oh! Oh, Mr. Rawlings.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.994
What is wrong?

31:49.081 --> 31:51.083
The INS came to my condo.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.084
The what?

31:52.171 --> 31:55.043
INS, immigration service.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.263
What'’d they say?

31:57.350 --> 31:59.526
Well, they were looking
for Roger and I,

31:59.613 --> 32:01.528
and so I told them
that he was working late.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.660
But trust me,
they'’re coming back.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.359
I should have never
let you talk me into this.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.404
You'’re a smart woman, Brooke.
You'’ll figure it out.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.319
I have faith.

32:10.406 --> 32:11.930
You think so?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.714
Absolutely!

32:13.801 --> 32:18.240
But if this thing goes sideways,
I had nothing to do with it.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.072
Roger! Oh, good.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.337
Oh, I didn'’t realize
you were bringing a guest.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.645
Um, Brooke, meet Gwen,
my girlfriend.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.343
Gwen, Brooke, my, uh...

32:34.430 --> 32:38.391
Coworker.
We work together at the office.

32:38.478 --> 32:43.352
Yes. Gwen decided to fly in on
a surprise visit for Christmas.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.050
Wasn'’t that... sweet?

32:45.137 --> 32:47.530
[giggles]
Surprise!

32:47.617 --> 32:49.968
Surprise.
[giggles]

32:50.055 --> 32:53.449
Roger, we need to talk.
We have big trouble.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.103
What is it?

32:55.190 --> 32:57.105
We have an arrangement. Um--

32:57.192 --> 32:59.847
See, we have an account.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.415
The married couple account.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.504
Oh, yes.

33:04.591 --> 33:08.987
Brooke and I
are working on a campaign

33:09.074 --> 33:11.424
about a newlywed couple

33:11.511 --> 33:14.905
that'’s going to debut
on the Super Bowl.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.431
Oh, the Super Bowl.
How exciting.

33:18.518 --> 33:23.175
Well, the representatives
came by to discuss the account,

33:23.262 --> 33:25.873
and they weren'’t very happy.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.702
- Why?
- Because you weren'’t there...

33:28.789 --> 33:30.791
- at the office.
- Oh.

33:30.878 --> 33:34.186
So they said we have
until Monday

33:34.273 --> 33:36.623
to get our presentation
together,

33:36.710 --> 33:41.497
or we are in serious jeopardy
of losing the account.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.065
A presentation on Christmas Eve?

33:44.152 --> 33:46.415
They were very insistent.
Very.

33:46.502 --> 33:51.638
Darling, I knew I shouldn'’t have
sprung this little trip on you.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.466
No, don'’t be silly.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.424
I feel terrible.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.252
Ifeel terrible.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.254
I think I'’m gonna throw up.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.343
Oh!

34:01.430 --> 34:04.042
Maybe you'’re, you know,
pregnant.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.131
- Ah, no!
- No!

34:06.218 --> 34:08.958
Look, why don'’t I take you
back to the flat,

34:09.047 --> 34:12.702
and then Brooke
can bring me up to speed.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.661
And I'’ll meet you
back at the...

34:14.748 --> 34:15.705
Office.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.141
- Office.
- Yes.

34:17.228 --> 34:20.884
- Right.
- No, darling, don'’t be silly.

34:20.971 --> 34:24.583
I'’ll take a cab.
You take care of this emergency.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.498
I love you.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.590
GWEN: See you soon, darling.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.471
Will you just relax?
Everything'’s gonna be fine.

34:42.558 --> 34:45.561
Relax?
Roger, someone reported us.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.781
- Now you'’re being paranoid.
- Those agents?

34:47.868 --> 34:49.348
Those agents,
they'’re gonna come back,

34:49.435 --> 34:50.914
and they are
gonna want answers.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.829
And they'’ll get them.

34:52.916 --> 34:56.485
Haven'’t you ever
crammed for an exam?

34:56.572 --> 34:58.400
Wow.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.185
You have a new condo.

35:00.272 --> 35:03.927
No. Wehave a new condo.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.147
We have excellent taste.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.149
I'’ve got messages.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.108
[beep]

35:10.195 --> 35:12.980
Mr. And Mrs. Burkett, this is
Agent Hedge with the INS.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.982
See? They probably
changed their mind already.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.418
I was just confirming
our appointment

35:16.505 --> 35:18.551
for 8 a.m.
Monday morning.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.857
It'’s imperative that both you
and your husband are present.

35:20.944 --> 35:22.598
- Guess not.
- Told you.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.166
- [beep]
- Hey, babe, it'’s Amanda.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.342
So Ryan sprung
a surprise date on me,

35:27.429 --> 35:29.562
so I'’m sorry, but I'’m not
going to be able to meet up.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.390
But I think that this is it!

35:31.477 --> 35:34.175
How'’s everything going
with your prince? Bye!

35:34.262 --> 35:36.177
- [beep]
- Hi, sweetheart, it'’s Mom.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.179
Hoping you can make it
to the Christmas party.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.964
- We'’d all love to see you.
- Not now, Mom.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.445
Look, I'’m type-A.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.709
I like to be prepared,
and I am not prepared for this.

35:46.796 --> 35:49.973
Well, looks like I'’m learning
something about you already.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.062
Why aren'’t you taking this
more seriously?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.108
- Oh, I am.
- Then why aren'’t you panicking?

35:54.195 --> 35:55.805
Because I don'’t.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.329
And I don'’t think
you have any reason to either.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.895
Oh, really?

35:58.982 --> 36:02.160
I can think of about
250,000 reasons.

36:02.247 --> 36:06.425
That is if going to jail
isn'’t enough for you.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.253
What are you doing?

36:08.340 --> 36:10.124
I want you to calm down.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.734
I am calm.

36:11.821 --> 36:12.996
Just breathe.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.825
In, out.

36:15.912 --> 36:20.134
Come on. In, out.

36:20.221 --> 36:24.007
Now, look, we are gonna
figure this out,

36:24.094 --> 36:27.576
and everything is
gonna be all right.

36:27.663 --> 36:30.318
All we want is
to create the illusion

36:30.405 --> 36:33.103
that we'’re both living here
together, right?

36:33.191 --> 36:35.018
Right.

36:35.105 --> 36:38.457
Well, for starters, I would
never live in such filth.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.415
- Filth?
- Not that I'’m judging.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.722
Oh, you'’re totally judging.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.506
What can I say?
I'’m a minimalist.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.552
Are you ever gonna
read any of this?

36:46.639 --> 36:48.641
I might.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.427
At least your family
likes Christmas.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.777
Yeah, they do.

36:54.864 --> 36:59.173
That'’s my mom, dad,
and that'’s my sister Tracy.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.306
And who is
this handsome bloke?

37:01.393 --> 37:05.484
That'’s David, Tracy'’s fiancé.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.138
Are you going?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.184
No, I wasn'’t planning to.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.839
Oh, I forgot.
You hate Christmas.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.493
I do not!

37:14.580 --> 37:17.670
It'’s just that...
I don'’t love it.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.369
Out of all the Americans
in the world,

37:21.456 --> 37:23.632
I married Scrooge.

37:23.719 --> 37:27.027
Don'’t you think we have more
important things to worry about?

37:27.114 --> 37:28.420
Such as?

37:28.507 --> 37:31.379
Figuring out
how not to go to jail.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.904
Well, is that the only thing?

37:37.777 --> 37:39.692
Yes.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.171
Bah humbug.

37:42.564 --> 37:46.176
All right,
what else do we need?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.527
Well, I told the agents
that we'’ve been together

37:48.614 --> 37:49.745
for a long time.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.399
And?

37:51.486 --> 37:55.925
If that'’s the case,
something'’s missing.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.190
Photos.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.372
How about that one?

38:10.288 --> 38:13.291
Mm! Look at you.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.727
That looks pretty good.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.294
Thank you.

38:17.947 --> 38:21.516
This might actually work.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.736
It might, too, at that.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.436
ROGER: Admit it.

38:28.523 --> 38:32.397
Your life was a disaster
until I showed up.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.442
All right, I'’ll admit it.

38:34.529 --> 38:37.097
I was a little bit untidy.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.404
[laughs]

38:39.491 --> 38:42.363
But I had a lot
on my mind lately.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.625
- [phone chimes]
- Oh.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.672
I forwarded the pictures
to my phone.

38:46.759 --> 38:50.937
Let'’s check out your work.

38:51.024 --> 38:53.243
Ah, wow.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.249
We actually look
pretty good here.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.426
Sure do.

39:01.513 --> 39:07.214
I mean, your Photoshopping
is nice.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.827
Thank you.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.308
You'’re welcome.

39:21.271 --> 39:24.057
It'’s getting late.

39:24.144 --> 39:26.581
I really should be going.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.931
We still got
some more work to do.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.934
Ah. Agreed.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.849
We haven'’t decorated.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.330
Decorating?

39:36.417 --> 39:37.853
For Christmas.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.117
Where are your decorations?

39:41.204 --> 39:42.815
Well...

39:42.902 --> 39:44.817
You don'’t have any.

39:44.904 --> 39:47.210
I told you.

39:47.297 --> 39:50.344
[laughs]

39:50.431 --> 39:52.564
If I'’m going to pretend
to live here,

39:52.651 --> 39:55.871
there are going to be
Christmas decorations.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.789
I thought you said
you were a minimalist.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.835
Look, I could pretend
to be married,

40:02.922 --> 40:06.404
but I can'’t pretend
I don'’t love...

40:10.190 --> 40:12.148
the season.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.108
Meet me tomorrow.

40:15.195 --> 40:19.068
We will go get some
proper Christmas decorations,

40:19.155 --> 40:20.983
and we'’ll pick out a tree.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.769
A tree? Oh, no.
We can go get a fake tree.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.074
We don'’t have
to get a real tree.

40:25.161 --> 40:27.120
Talk about being messy.

40:27.207 --> 40:30.297
The needles will
get everywhere, shedding.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.518
By the time the 25th
comes along,

40:33.605 --> 40:37.304
I will have you singing
"Jingle Bells."

40:37.391 --> 40:38.914
I doubt that.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.568
I don'’t.

40:41.917 --> 40:45.791
We shall see.
[laughs]

40:45.878 --> 40:48.010
Tomorrow.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.316
Yeah.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.104
[sighs]

40:57.542 --> 40:59.674
♪ Jingle bells ♪

40:59.761 --> 41:02.285
♪ Jingle bells ♪

41:02.372 --> 41:04.853
♪ Jingle every day ♪

41:04.940 --> 41:08.422
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪

41:08.509 --> 41:10.946
♪ In a little
horse-driven sleigh ♪

41:11.033 --> 41:12.165
♪ Hey ♪

41:13.253 --> 41:15.734
That is so not it.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.622
- This isn'’t so bad, is it?
- What do you mean?

41:34.709 --> 41:36.972
Eggnog peppermint lattes,

41:37.059 --> 41:40.802
searching for
the perfect Christmas tree.

41:40.889 --> 41:44.197
You don'’t think this is the most
wonderful time of the year?

41:44.284 --> 41:46.939
Well, I guess I did
when I was younger.

41:47.026 --> 41:49.463
Now it'’s like
the most lone--

41:49.550 --> 41:51.900
awkward time of the year.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.599
Any particular reason?

41:54.686 --> 42:00.648
Your sister'’s fiancé,
possibly?

42:00.735 --> 42:03.433
Look, if anything
is bothering you...

42:03.521 --> 42:05.479
Look, I already
told you that--

42:05.566 --> 42:10.049
Brooke, you don'’t have
to hide anything from me,

42:10.136 --> 42:12.530
and you don'’t have
to face anything alone.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.009
Thank you.

42:16.969 --> 42:19.798
This was my wife'’s
favorite holiday.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.190
You were married?

42:21.277 --> 42:25.238
I was, in another life.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.153
[laughs]

42:27.240 --> 42:29.808
She passed away
a long time ago.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.898
I'’m sorry to hear that.

42:36.336 --> 42:37.424
Thank you.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.426
You'’re welcome.

42:43.691 --> 42:44.997
Oh, wow.

42:45.084 --> 42:46.607
What is it?

42:46.694 --> 42:48.914
That guy right there
is the agent from the INS.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.437
Hi!

42:50.524 --> 42:51.438
Mrs. Burkett.

42:51.525 --> 42:52.831
- Yes.
- Yes, hi.

42:52.918 --> 42:54.093
It'’s funny
bumping into you here.

42:54.180 --> 42:57.357
Hysterical.
[laughs]

42:57.444 --> 43:00.926
Someone insisted
that we decorate.

43:02.623 --> 43:03.842
Oh, you must be
Brooke'’s husband.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.322
Yes, Agent Hedge
from the INS.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.281
This is my husband.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.370
Burkett, Roger Burkett.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.198
Roger, yes, right,
it'’s nice to finally meet you.

43:12.285 --> 43:14.417
I'’m sorry we missed you
yesterday.

43:14.504 --> 43:17.333
How about this one, Dad?

43:17.420 --> 43:19.945
Oh, yeah,
that'’s a really nice one.

43:20.032 --> 43:22.425
This is Mr. and Mrs. Burkett.

43:22.512 --> 43:23.644
This is Kate.

43:23.731 --> 43:24.819
- Hi, Kate.
- Hello.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.168
Either of you have children?

43:26.255 --> 43:28.562
- No.
- We think well of dogs.

43:28.649 --> 43:30.085
We were just
talking about that.

43:30.172 --> 43:32.044
We'’re thinking possibly...

43:32.131 --> 43:34.263
- Five.
- ...two.

43:34.350 --> 43:37.876
I want a big family.
[laughs]

43:37.963 --> 43:39.704
Sure you'’re married?

43:39.791 --> 43:41.575
Honey, manners.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.839
You know, my wife and I,

43:44.926 --> 43:47.146
we actually met on
a Christmas tree lot years ago.

43:47.233 --> 43:48.843
Really? So did we.

43:51.367 --> 43:53.674
I thought you said you met
on a singles cruise.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.328
Yes, it was a singles cruise.

43:55.415 --> 43:57.896
It was a Christmas cruise.

43:57.983 --> 43:59.375
- A Christmas cruise?
- Yes.

43:59.462 --> 44:03.205
Can you believe they had
a tree lot on the boat?

44:03.292 --> 44:04.729
Lots of trees.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.513
How about that.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.471
Yeah.

44:08.558 --> 44:10.778
Honey, we should go
get this one, huh?

44:10.865 --> 44:12.519
Yeah.

44:12.606 --> 44:14.086
It was nice to finally
meet you, Roger.

44:14.173 --> 44:15.870
- My pleasure.
- Oh, I guess that...

44:15.957 --> 44:17.959
now there'’s no need
for the evaluation.

44:21.136 --> 44:23.225
Agent Adams and I
will be at your residence

44:23.312 --> 44:24.444
the day after tomorrow.

44:24.531 --> 44:27.186
See you then.
[laughs]

44:27.273 --> 44:29.144
Merry Christmas.

44:29.231 --> 44:31.103
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

44:36.935 --> 44:40.852
So how come you never
mentioned you were married?

44:42.680 --> 44:43.985
Never really came up.

44:44.072 --> 44:46.379
Like I said,
it was a long time ago.

44:46.466 --> 44:49.556
So she loved Christmas, huh?

44:49.643 --> 44:53.734
Loved it. Every year,
we'’d have a big celebration,

44:53.821 --> 44:56.432
a roaring fire in the fireplace,

44:56.519 --> 44:59.087
roasted turkey on the table,

44:59.174 --> 45:03.135
colorful lights
twinkling on the tree.

45:03.222 --> 45:04.832
Sounds like a fairy tale.

45:04.919 --> 45:07.182
You just need
to open yourself up.

45:07.269 --> 45:10.446
Sit back, relax,
and take it all in.

45:11.752 --> 45:13.754
I think my tree is crooked.

45:13.841 --> 45:16.714
[chuckles]
You do make me laugh.

45:16.801 --> 45:19.760
Hey, I'’ve got an idea.

45:19.847 --> 45:21.806
No, you don'’t.

45:21.893 --> 45:24.199
We should go to
your parents'’ Christmas party.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.507
Are you crazy?

45:27.594 --> 45:29.683
It'’s the chance to experience
a nice Christmas

45:29.770 --> 45:31.293
with the family.

45:31.380 --> 45:34.166
[scoffs]
You don'’t know my family.

45:34.253 --> 45:36.211
Exactly, and I'’d love
to meet them.

45:36.298 --> 45:39.084
- You would?
- Of course.

45:39.171 --> 45:42.087
I suppose they'’re my family now
as well, aren'’t they?

45:42.174 --> 45:45.133
Hmm. I suppose.

45:45.220 --> 45:50.269
Besides, what better way
to learn more about you, right?

45:50.356 --> 45:53.707
Not to mention it would be
a good dress rehearsal.

45:53.794 --> 45:55.622
Dress rehearsal?

45:55.709 --> 45:59.757
If we could fool your family,
we could certainly fool the INS.

45:59.844 --> 46:02.629
- You'’re serious?
- Come on.

46:02.716 --> 46:05.501
Bring your husband
to meet your family.

46:05.588 --> 46:07.547
It'’ll be fun.

46:07.634 --> 46:10.550
If I told my family I got
married, they would kill me.

46:10.637 --> 46:13.596
Well, then, um...

46:13.683 --> 46:16.730
I'’ll just have to pretend
to be your boyfriend.

46:16.817 --> 46:19.515
I don'’t think
they'’d buy that either.

46:19.602 --> 46:23.955
- Why not?
-It'’s just that you'’re so...

46:24.042 --> 46:25.826
What?

46:25.913 --> 46:28.002
Never mind.
It'’s not important.

46:28.089 --> 46:31.092
But it sure would be nice
to show up with a date.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.964
- What was that?
- Nothing.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.836

Ahem.

58:48.481 --> 58:49.438
[clears throat]

58:49.526 --> 58:52.354
Roger Burkett, please.

58:55.227 --> 58:57.011
Roger Burkett...

58:57.098 --> 58:59.231
Sorry. Mr. Burkett
actually isn'’t here today.

58:59.318 --> 59:01.799
See, we have everyone sign in
on the weekends,

59:01.886 --> 59:03.409
and he hasn'’t been here
all day.

59:03.496 --> 59:05.063
Are you sure?

59:05.150 --> 59:08.675
Unless he slipped by me,
but it'’s highly unlikely.

59:10.329 --> 59:11.852
Perhaps I can help you.

59:11.939 --> 59:14.768
Oh, I'’m looking
for Roger Burkett.

59:14.855 --> 59:16.770
He just started working here.

59:16.857 --> 59:19.251
Oh, yes,
the British graphic designer.

59:19.338 --> 59:20.557
He'’s so talented.

59:20.644 --> 59:22.123
And you are?

59:22.210 --> 59:23.690
Gwen.

59:23.777 --> 59:25.039
I'’m the girlfriend.

59:25.126 --> 59:26.824
Oh.

59:26.911 --> 59:28.782
So nice to meet you.

59:28.869 --> 59:30.175
You as well.

59:30.262 --> 59:32.481
- Follow me.
- All right.

59:38.662 --> 59:40.577
Come on in my study.

59:44.145 --> 59:45.582
Have a seat.

59:58.203 --> 01:00:02.555
I have to admit,
you caught me off-guard.

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:04.252
Engaged?

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:06.298
Oh, well...

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:09.388
I... apologize.

01:00:09.475 --> 01:00:11.651
Your daughter is very special.

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:14.393
I know.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.351
What are your intentions?

01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:18.702
My intentions, sir?

01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:20.442
With my daughter,
with your life,

01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:24.316
with your lives together.

01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:26.100
I'’ll cut to the chase.

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:31.323
Roger, are you even a citizen?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:34.935
Excuse me, sir?

01:00:35.022 --> 01:00:37.372
You may not be aware,

01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:41.681
but people generally refer to me
as a traditional man.

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:44.292
I'’ve picked up on that, Wade.

01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:45.772
Mr. Harris.

01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:47.948
Uh, Mr. Harris.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:52.605
Now, David, Tracy'’s fiancé,
he'’s traditional, too.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:55.782
Of course, we knew David
already, obviously,

01:00:55.869 --> 01:00:58.611
but he asked
for our permission

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.353
before he even bought a ring
for my Tracy.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.485
He went through
the proper channels.

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:05.618
Do you follow me, Roger?

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:08.360
It'’s funny you should
bring that up, sir.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.405
Part of the reason
why we came here tonight

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:12.930
was to ask your permission.

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:15.628
Don'’t you know you'’re supposed
to ask for permission

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:18.283
before the proposal?

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.548
Sir, where I'’m from,

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:26.421
we tend to do things
in a different order.

01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:28.162
Oh?

01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:33.167
Just like we drive on
the opposite side of the road.

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:37.519
Well, I never thought
about that.

01:01:37.606 --> 01:01:41.262
Yes. Here'’s something
from your side of the pond.

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:44.309
Take a look at this.

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:49.140
Is that a McKenzie single malt,
what, aged 30 years?

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:51.925
Forty. You a scotch man?

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.667
I am just an admirer, sir.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:58.802
That picture?

01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:04.459
I took on a golf trip
to Scotland on my 50th birthday.

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:07.462
Wow.

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:10.030
"Citizen of the Year"?

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:13.468
Citizenship is more than
a piece of paper.

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:16.123
I'’m getting sentimental
in my old age.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:19.039
Seeing my daughters grow up

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.607
gets me to thinking
about my grandkids

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:24.175
and the world
they'’re gonna come in to,

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:28.483
and the country
they'’re gonna live in.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:32.009
Whether it'’s here
or London or Scotland

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.706
or wherever it is,

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:38.624
I want my daughter
to be happy wherever she is.

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:43.498
Honestly, sir,
I can tell you

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:47.372
that even though
I'’ve only known your daughter

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:49.983
for a short amount of time,

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:55.859
I can tell you that I have
never met anyone quite like her.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:03.823
I just think
she'’s an amazing woman, sir.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.478
Hmm.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:07.566
Well.

01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.309
A toast.

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:17.358
To my amazing daughter...

01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:21.319
and your future wife.

01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:23.364
Thank you, sir.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:24.583
Mr. Harris.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.411
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:32.809
Nice, huh?

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:34.288
Smooth.

01:03:36.943 --> 01:03:40.077
You know, I can'’t tell you
how relieved I am

01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.427
that you and Roger
are engaged.

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:43.776
What do you mean?

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:45.691
Come on.

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:49.521
We both know darn well
what I'’m talking about.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.088
You never got over him.

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:53.351
That'’s ridiculous.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:55.309
Is it?

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:57.485
I saw you two
in your bedroom.

01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:01.359
Tracy, I'’m not sure
what you thought you saw.

01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:06.233
I'’m just relieved that we can
finally put this all behind us.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.495
What?

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:10.194
You know,
I almost felt guilty.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:11.848
For?

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:14.241
For you being alone.

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:18.419
You know, when David and I
ended up together.

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:21.814
Hi, sweetheart!
We need to go.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:26.340
But you'’re not alone anymore,
are you?

01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:28.168
It'’s Gwen.

01:04:28.255 --> 01:04:30.779
Who'’s Gwen?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.651
He has a pet bulldog.

01:04:32.738 --> 01:04:35.654
- Oh.
- We need to go.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:39.223
Listen, today was supposed to
have been your big announcement,

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.094
so we'’re gonna go.

01:04:41.181 --> 01:04:43.140
Wait! Are you sure?

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:44.141
Yeah.

01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:46.926
Brooke, please.

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:49.363
I'’m really happy for you.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:50.669
Thank you.

01:04:50.756 --> 01:04:52.453
Merry Christmas.

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:57.850
I'’ll get the car.

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.466
Sorry you have to leave.

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.512
Honey, don'’t let this one
get away.

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.906
I actually really like him.

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:11.559
Really?

01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:15.389
Your mother'’s right.
You got a good one there.

01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:17.826
Bye, Daddy.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.698
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:21.091
Y'’all be good.

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:23.484
Bye, sweetheart.

01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:24.659
Bye.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:42.460
So how long were
you and David together?

01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.205
I understand.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:51.208
It'’s probably a little awkward
to talk about.

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.731
Actually, it is.

01:05:56.822 --> 01:05:59.390
You know, something
just occurred to me.

01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:02.871
You'’ve been all over my life.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:07.702
My parents, my sister,
my ex-boyfriend, my house.

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:10.749
All so we can keep you
in the country.

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:14.231
Now we'’re running out of time
and rushing home

01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:16.885
so you can spend Christmas
with your little girlfriend.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.410
- Brooke--
- You'’re gonna propose to her.

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.020
Propose?

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:23.370
May I remind you
that you'’re already married,

01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:25.677
and marrying her
would be illegal,

01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:28.462
almost as illegal as
our little sham of a marriage.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:33.119
Brooke, what is this about?

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:36.079
It'’s crazy.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.602
These past couple of days,

01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:40.344
I actually felt myself
getting closer to you.

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.780
Really?

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:43.521
You'’re not a bad guy.

01:06:43.608 --> 01:06:47.177
[chuckles]
Was that a compliment?

01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:49.179
But you'’re someone else'’s guy.

01:06:49.266 --> 01:06:54.053
And no matter what happens,
I can'’t let myself forget that.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.750
Brooke...

01:06:55.837 --> 01:06:56.969
I'’m just tired.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.579
I'’m tired of all the acting.

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:00.494
I'’m tired of putting forth
all the effort

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.844
and then someone else
walks away with the ring.

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.542
First David and now...

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:09.634
I don'’t care anymore.
I don'’t.

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:12.202
If it didn'’t mean
going to jail,

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:15.031
I'’d be perfectly happy
never seeing you again.

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:27.217
I just thought we were beginning
to be mates, you and I.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:29.436
Mate?

01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:30.829
You mean friends.

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.961
Yes, friends.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.182
That'’s what we want
people to think.

01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:38.141
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

01:07:40.186 --> 01:07:42.275
All we gotta do is just get
through this interview tomorrow.

01:07:42.362 --> 01:07:44.451
After that, it'’s over.

01:07:57.421 --> 01:08:02.991
Brooke, would you ever
leave the city?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.342
What?

01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:10.347
You know, if you have
the right reason,

01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:13.480
the right opportunity,

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:17.093
would you be open to--
I don'’t know--

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.006
going somewhere else?

01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:27.973
- Gwen.
- What?

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.064
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.022
Hopefully for
the performance of your life.

01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:41.377
Hi. What are you doing here?

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:43.380
The question is,
where have you been?

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:45.555
Well, I was at work with, um...

01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:58.220
Married?
I still can'’t believe it.

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:00.613
I am so sorry.

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:05.184
This is why
I didn'’t come home.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.622
It'’s why I'’ve been
avoiding you all weekend.

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:11.234
It'’s not the job. It'’s...

01:09:11.321 --> 01:09:12.930
It'’s why I didn'’t
come home for Christmas.

01:09:13.018 --> 01:09:15.020
I was afraid to tell you.

01:09:15.107 --> 01:09:16.630
That you'’re married?

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:19.459
That... I didn'’t
love you anymore.

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:22.636
- Ohh!
- I care for you, I do.

01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:28.120
We'’ve been together for so long,
Gwen, I didn'’t want to hurt you.

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:31.254
But we'’re not kids anymore,
is that it?

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:34.474
The thing is, you and I,

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.607
we'’re not on the same path
anymore, Gwen,

01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:38.304
and I'’m okay with that.

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:40.176
I'’ve made my peace with it.

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:43.613
However, I feel strongly that
the responsible thing to do

01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:48.792
is to end this thing
before it goes any further.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.404
[scoffs]

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:53.189
Do you love her?

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.194
I just met her.

01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:02.110
That is not what I asked you.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.594
[scoffs]

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:16.734
That went well, didn'’t it?

01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.301
Amanda?

01:10:18.388 --> 01:10:20.825
[sobbing]

01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:23.131
Are you okay?

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.308
Ryan and I broke up.

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:27.484
Oh, honey.

01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:30.617
Here I was expecting
to get a ring for Christmas,

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:33.141
and then he tells me
he needs time.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.448
I mean, what does that
even mean?

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:39.800
So then he just tells me
that he wants to break up.

01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:43.326
Like, just like that,
right before Christmas.

01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:46.851
And now I have to take back
all of his gifts,

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:48.853
and I spent
so much money on him.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.160
I mean, an obscene amount.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.555
Like obscene.

01:10:55.642 --> 01:11:01.169
Maybe now you can buy yourself
something nice for Christmas.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.041
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:11:03.128 --> 01:11:05.609
Ohh...

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:07.828
So how about you?

01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:09.743
How about Roger?

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.485
You spent the weekend together.
That must have been nice, right?

01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:15.358
Yeah, swell.

01:11:15.445 --> 01:11:17.795
Well, any news?

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:19.884
Well, he'’s back
with his girlfriend,

01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:23.104
and I'’ll probably be
getting arrested tomorrow.

01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:26.369
Is that it?

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:29.241
- That'’s not enough?
- I know you too well.

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:31.591
You guys spent
the whole weekend together,

01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:33.201
and there were no sparks?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.813
No sparks at all?
Not even a single little one?

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.423
- Stop.
- What?

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.382
You love him.

01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:42.298
Oh! I said stop!

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:45.997
Hey, sweets, what'’s wrong?

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:50.088
I'’ve spent the past few weeks

01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:52.177
pretending to be
married to someone,

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:55.180
and these past few days,

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:57.835
I'’ve spent time with him
and got closer to him,

01:11:57.922 --> 01:12:00.881
and he turns out
to be a great guy.

01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:05.669
I mean, he is gentle, kind,

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.888
and sweet and...

01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:09.760
And?

01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:12.023
Do you want to know
why I haven'’t been

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:15.200
to my parents'’ house for
Christmas the past few years?

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:17.420
- Your sister.
- No.

01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:19.291
I mean, well, yeah.

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:23.904
But look, I'’m just tired
of my parents asking me,

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:25.776
"When are you gonna
find somebody?"

01:12:25.863 --> 01:12:27.212
I'’m getting tired
of you asking me,

01:12:27.299 --> 01:12:29.083
"When are you gonna
find somebody?"

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:30.650
I'’m getting tired
of asking myself,

01:12:30.737 --> 01:12:32.304
"When are you gonna
find somebody?"

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:34.262
But you have found somebody.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.395
And he has a girlfriend.

01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:39.050
He'’s probably proposing
to her right now.

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.268
So was Ryan.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:44.185
- What?
- Brooke, you'’re smart,

01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:47.537
and you'’re beautiful,
and you'’re talented,

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:50.757
but you'’re also
as stubborn as an ox.

01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:54.805
I mean, when are you
gonna take a chance?

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:56.633
How do you expect
to get anywhere

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.505
if you won'’t even set foot
inside of an airport?

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:02.073
You need to get out of your
comfort zone and take a leap,

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.075
or you are never
gonna be happy.

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:07.600
You need to tell this guy
how you feel!

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:11.082
I mean, it may seem
a little bit rich,

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:13.650
me giving you
relationship advice right now,

01:13:13.737 --> 01:13:15.956
since I have a broken heart.

01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:19.873
But at least
I took a chance, right?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.875
And it doesn'’t make me
think any less

01:13:21.962 --> 01:13:24.965
that my prince
is out there somewhere.

01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:27.185
And so is yours.

01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:32.799
And he'’s closer
than you think.

01:13:36.934 --> 01:13:38.762
Thanks, girl.

01:14:11.055 --> 01:14:12.752
BROOKE: Where are you?

01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:14.841
There was heavy traffic on
the way back from the airport.

01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:17.496
Airport?
Why were you at the airport?

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.716
Dropping off Gwen.

01:14:19.803 --> 01:14:22.545
- Gwen?
- Look, I'’ll explain.

01:14:22.632 --> 01:14:24.460
No, there'’s no time.

01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:26.549
Have you forgotten
what today is?

01:14:26.636 --> 01:14:28.594
No, no, no, no,
not at all.

01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:30.814
Look, I finally told her.

01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:32.032
[knocking]

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.425
They'’re here.

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.340
I'’ve gotta stall, Roger.
Hurry.

01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:46.394
Come on in.

01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:51.574
AGENT HEDGE: Hmm. Hmm.

01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:52.618
Mm-hmm.

01:14:58.015 --> 01:14:59.320
Hmm.

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:03.324
- Nice photo.
- Thank you.

01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:07.764
You seem a little nervous.

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:09.505
I'’m fine, I'’m fine.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:14.335
It'’s just not every day
you have federal agents over.

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:15.859
Until recently.

01:15:15.946 --> 01:15:17.077
Right.

01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:18.731
We have a big day ahead of us,

01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:20.603
so we want to make this
as quick as possible.

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.561
How long is your husband
gonna be?

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:23.867
He should be here soon.

01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:25.390
He should be here, period.

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:28.611
There'’s a crack there.

01:15:28.698 --> 01:15:30.395
Excuse me?

01:15:32.353 --> 01:15:34.442
The picture frame.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.922
There'’s a crack.

01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:37.402
When was that picture taken?

01:15:40.013 --> 01:15:41.232
Right after we met.

01:15:41.319 --> 01:15:43.539
When was that again?

01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:46.977
[knocking]

01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:49.066
Oh, he'’s here.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:51.808
Does your husband always knock
before coming into his own home?

01:15:51.895 --> 01:15:55.551
Well, you know how guys are,
always forgetting their keys.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:56.769
I'’ll be right back.

01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:01.731
Hurry.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.951
Here he is.

01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:07.040
Honey, did you
forget your keys again?

01:16:07.127 --> 01:16:08.868
Yes, yes, I did.

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.827
I figured since you
were gonna be here.

01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:12.089
Of course.

01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:14.352
- Agent Marie Adams.
- Pleasure.

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.223
Agent Hedge.
Nice to see you again.

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.357
Yes, Christmas tree lot.
Good to see you, too.

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.925
Now that everyone'’s here,
maybe we should get started.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:27.060
You two get along okay?

01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:29.019
Any spats?

01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:30.411
Spats?

01:16:30.498 --> 01:16:32.762
Come on.
Find it hard to believe.

01:16:32.849 --> 01:16:36.200
All this time together
and not a single argument?

01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:39.159
What was
your last argument about?

01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:41.422
It'’s hard to say.

01:16:41.509 --> 01:16:43.903
ROGER: What was it about?

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:48.516
Oh, she was mad at me
for something, but, uh--

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:52.520
See that? That'’s what she does
when she'’s upset.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:53.652
BROOKE: Stop.

01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:56.786
Told you. Upset.

01:16:56.873 --> 01:17:01.442
No, honestly,
I think she'’s incredible.

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:05.533
And even though she refuses
to sing "Jingle Bells" for me--

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.014
Not true.

Look, I'’ve only known her
for a short time, but...

01:17:13.498 --> 01:17:15.631
I think she'’s brilliant.

01:17:18.329 --> 01:17:19.939
Roger.

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.681
What'’s the matter?
Don'’t you believe him?

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:25.858
I meant every word.

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:29.340
Even the part about only
knowing her for a short time?

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:34.301
Your Photoshopping
is very impressive.

01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:37.957
It is your line of work, right?

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:41.395
Well, this is ours.

01:17:41.482 --> 01:17:43.354
We'’ve been doing this
a long time.

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.442
We know.

Look, um...
[clears throat]

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:59.326

Roger, don'’t.

01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:03.461
Look, truth is,

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:07.030
anything that she'’s done,
she did it for me.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:10.381
- You don'’t have to do this.
- No, no, I do.

01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:13.645
Maybe I haven'’t been
as honest as I should'’ve been,

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.256
but I have to do this.

01:18:16.343 --> 01:18:20.173
Brooke is the sweetest,

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.393
smartest,

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.136
most selfless woman
I have ever met,

01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:30.401
and I don'’t want her
to get in any trouble.

01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.403
She'’s in very big trouble,
Roger.

01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:39.149
Please, Mr. Hedge, I'’ll...

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:43.719
- I'’ll leave today.
- No.

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:45.895
Yes, you will.

01:18:45.982 --> 01:18:47.461
And you, Miss Harris,

01:18:47.548 --> 01:18:49.159
since your marriage
has proven to be fraud,

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:51.465
we'’ll be in touch
regarding court dates.

01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:54.033
- Miss Harris!
- I understand.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.470
I wouldn'’t leave the state
if I were you.

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.299

I thought I was
the only one still here.

Well, I just thought
I'’d get a head start

It'’s over, Mr. Rawlings.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:29.302
I am going to be charged
with marriage fraud.

01:20:29.389 --> 01:20:31.783
I'’ll probably be going
to jail tomorrow,

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:34.873
and Roger will be on his way
back to London.

- Oh, no. It'’s my fault.
- No.

I could have said no.
I should have said no.

Then why didn'’t you?

01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:44.927
I didn'’t want to lose my job
right before Christmas.

01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:46.842
Is that the only reason?

01:20:46.929 --> 01:20:49.409
First of all,

01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:51.498

Thank you,
Mr. Rawlings.

With all the trouble,
I couldn'’t help but notice

01:20:57.678 --> 01:21:01.465
the worst thing was you'’re
losing Roger, am I right?

01:21:01.552 --> 01:21:03.902
Yeah.

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:06.905

Having him around?

I think I'’ve fallen
in love with him.

01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:14.913
Then what are you
doing here?

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.828
Why aren'’t you on the way
to London to get him back?

'’Cause the INS said
I can'’t leave.

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:33.801
I got something better
than that.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.107
What?

01:21:35.194 --> 01:21:36.804
I have a Black Card.

01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:41.374
Is everyone there?

01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:44.334
Great. I'’ll see you guys
at the airport.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.902
[ding]

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:53.125
Uh, hey, lady,
where you headed?

01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:55.345
I'’m getting a husband
for Christmas.

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:10.882
INS, INS.

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:12.231
Roger!

01:22:12.318 --> 01:22:14.016
Ms. Harris.

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.279
- Excuse me. I'’m sorry.
- What are you doing?

01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:19.282
Hold this. One moment.
I can do it.

01:22:19.369 --> 01:22:23.025
Sorry. I can do this.
I can do this.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.638
What are you doing here?

01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:29.814
I want to go with you
to England, Roger.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.430
There'’s something
I'’ve got to do first.

01:22:39.302 --> 01:22:40.477
Mr. Harris.

01:22:40.564 --> 01:22:41.521
Yes?

01:22:41.608 --> 01:22:43.523
May I have your permission

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:48.441
to ask your daughter
to marry me officially?

01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:51.967
- Absolutely.
- Really?

01:22:57.668 --> 01:22:59.409
Will you marry me?

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.979
Yes, Roger.

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:07.330
Welcome to the family, Roger.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:12.204
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

01:23:12.291 --> 01:23:13.771
Just call me Dad.

01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:18.819
Now there'’s something
I need to do.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.476
I can'’t believe this.

01:23:23.563 --> 01:23:26.044
Tracy, I just want to say
that I'’m sorry.

01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:27.959
For what?

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:29.830
For being so selfish.

01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:34.705
David is a great guy,
and he is so lucky to have you.

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:37.012
Thank you, Brooke.

01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:40.667
Too bad you'’re such a pain.
[laughs]

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:41.973
The feeling'’s mutual.

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.932
- I love you. Come here.
- I love you.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.978
Now, that'’s
the best Christmas gift

01:23:47.065 --> 01:23:48.936
we'’ve gotten this year.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.809
And to think
we owe it all to Roger.

01:23:51.896 --> 01:23:53.289
Thank you, Mother.

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:55.247
He called me Mother!

01:23:58.076 --> 01:24:00.078
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Burkett.

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:04.343
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Burkett.

01:24:08.304 --> 01:24:10.784
- Well, I guess it'’s official.
- Yeah.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:13.048
They are definitely in love.

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:16.051
Roger?

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:20.185
