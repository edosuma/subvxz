00:28.529 --> 00:31.533
Sorry. I thought you were gone.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.454
Ron, this is my bathroom.

00:33.534 --> 00:37.292
If you're gonna stay here, you're gonna
have to use the bathroom downstairs.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.042
Dad's in that one.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.466
Well, then, you're going to have to wait.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.465
How long?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.547
Close the door.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.785
Shit.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.619
Yeah.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.303
- What the hell are you doing?
- God! God, Jesus!

01:31.008 --> 01:32.260
Dad...

01:32.342 --> 01:35.265
Your mother puts orange juice in that thing.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.518
I'm... I'm gonna wash it. I... I was just...

01:38.223 --> 01:40.145
Can I have some privacy please?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.772
Well, where do you want me to go?

01:41.852 --> 01:44.901
Just, away! I can't...
I can't pee while you're looking at me!

01:51.862 --> 01:53.034
Sally?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.451
What are you doing on the floor, Chief?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.540
I don't know.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.708
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I... I can't...

02:01.788 --> 02:04.166
What's going on?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Dad!

02:05.334 --> 02:07.553
- The curling iron!
- Come on, Chief, get up.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.045
Oh, my God.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.967
- Can't move.
- Okay.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.550
Dad, call an ambulance.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.431
Okay. It's okay.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.975
You're okay.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.999
Rutledge Publishing.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.338
John. It's me.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.508
Becca, I'm so sorry.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.840
I know I missed the appointment.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.469
I... I got swamped.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.013
I thought I was going to make it, but...

02:56.093 --> 02:57.681
Doctor say, "Baby looks good?"

02:57.761 --> 03:00.014
Yeah, it was fine.
We can talk about it another time.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.228
Okay.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.019
Could I actually call you in a few minutes?

03:05.102 --> 03:07.941
I'm going through
a little bit of a thing here at work

03:08.021 --> 03:09.273
- and...
- Hey.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.237
Hey.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.239
How did you even get in here?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.287
- I thought you needed a card to...
- John, listen.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.785
Your dad called me,

03:18.865 --> 03:21.705
and he wanted me to tell you...

03:21.785 --> 03:23.287
My dad called you?

03:26.456 --> 03:31.132
Your mom had a seizure this morning,
and they think that it might be a brain tumor.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.133
What?

03:33.213 --> 03:36.968
So, I booked you a flight

03:37.050 --> 03:39.803
that's going to get you in around 3:30.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.269
I know this is a lot.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.855
But your mother's in the hospital, so...

03:48.478 --> 03:50.526
You do need to go now.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.034
Yeah.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.400
Look at that kitchen.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.528
I'd get rid of that ugly island.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.075
Take the whole wall out.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.952
Great idea.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.616
What are they asking?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.155
$300.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.490
For that?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.450
I wouldn't even walk by that house.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.330
- No.
- Never! Never.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.835
- Can't be.
- Do you think they pay for their own labor?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.503
No, has to be donated.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.085
- Let's watch The Brothers.
- No.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.294
Just knock it down and start again.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.216
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, my goodness.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.385
How did you know?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.842
Don!

05:42.425 --> 05:44.097
- How you doing, Dad?
- It's great to see you, son.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.554
Good to see you, too.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.897
Come give Mom a hug.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.101
How you doing, Mom?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.482
I'm doing great.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.233
- Feeling all right?
- Doing great. Doing great.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.314
What happened to your wrist?

05:56.398 --> 05:57.775
Brain tumor.

05:57.941 --> 05:58.942
Have you been smoking?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.825
- No.
- You smell like an ashtray.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.868
- I don't know...
- John.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.825
Don't lie to your mother.
She almost died today.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.785
- What?
- She didn't almost die.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.207
That's not what the doctor said.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.005
He wasn't a doctor. He was a nurse.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.128
We haven't seen a doctor yet.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.962
And you're scaring Mom.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.631
I'm not scared. I just...

06:17.711 --> 06:19.925
I just don't want John dying of lung cancer.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.843
- I only had one, so...
- Well,

06:21.923 --> 06:23.887
don't have another one.
You're going to be a father soon.

06:23.967 --> 06:24.968
I know.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.928
- That guy was a nurse?
- Yeah.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.059
- He was in John's class in high school.
- Who was?

06:29.139 --> 06:31.983
- Jason.
- Jason... Jason Owens?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.777
He married Gwen.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.986
- Just had a kid.
- Really?

06:40.442 --> 06:41.864
I can't believe I didn't know that.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.241
You never call, so...

06:44.321 --> 06:45.322
Who's Gwen?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.370
Gwen. Gwen?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.038
Johnny's girlfriend in high school.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.621
- They were engaged, for God's sake.
- John had a girlfriend in high school?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.081
- Don!
- It was complicated, Dad. It was...

06:54.164 --> 06:58.421
Jesus Christ, Dad, where have you
been our whole lives anyway?

06:58.501 --> 07:01.254
Work... I've been working
to send you kids to college,

07:01.338 --> 07:02.551
that's where I've been.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.302
Yeah. A lot of good that did.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.259
- What did... What did you say?
- Nothing.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.889
No, what did you just say to me right now?

07:07.969 --> 07:08.932
How long has she been married?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.058
- I didn't say anything.
- About a year.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.515
You better watch yourself.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.937
Is that a threat?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.564
No, that's a promise.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.608
It doesn't even make sense.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.781
I'll punch you in the face.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.111
What?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.943
- I swear to God I will.
- Really?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.528
- Yeah.
- What's stopping you?

07:24.611 --> 07:25.703
What...

07:26.529 --> 07:29.157
- Guys.
- Don, you apologize to Ron right now!

07:33.161 --> 07:35.125
All right, Ronnie, I'm sorry,
but you can't be...

07:35.205 --> 07:36.206
Yeah.

07:36.873 --> 07:37.961
Guys, are you kidding me?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.714
- He... Did you see?
- Guys.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.464
Guys.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.296
- Guys!
- Boys!

07:43.380 --> 07:44.882
- Guys!
- What?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.304
Sally Hollar?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.686
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm Dr. Fong. Sorry for the wait.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.858
I was golfing.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.728
No... No problem, Doctor.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.195
So, I looked over your CAT scans.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.737
You have a pretty big brain tumor
near your frontal lobe.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.200
Christ. Jesus Christ!

08:09.280 --> 08:11.620
Wait. What does that mean, "pretty big?"

08:11.700 --> 08:14.247
It means "big."

08:14.327 --> 08:15.453
Well, what do we do?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.584
Well, we have to remove it soon.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.213
I've scheduled
a craniotomy for the end of the week.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.338
We can give your mother steroids
to reduce the size of the tumor,

08:24.421 --> 08:26.468
but the seizures will continue
if nothing's done.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.016
Steroids.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.846
Excuse me, Doctor.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.054
What will the steroids do to her muscles?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.392
Will it make her bulky?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.563
Ron.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.854
- No.
- Christ. Christ.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.187
- Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ.
- Get a grip, Dad.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.857
Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.566
I don't understand.
How... How did something like this happen?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.821
It could be any number of reasons.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.450
We really have no way of knowing
right now, but I will say this.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.077
It is not a young tumor.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.535
I'd say it must have been growing

08:54.617 --> 08:58.541
inside Mrs. Hollar's head
for the past 10, maybe 15 years.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.964
- What?
- Yeah.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.630
To be honest, I'm surprised
there haven't been more symptoms.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.509
Would loss of sight in one eye
be a symptom?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.803
- Possibly.
- What about

09:10.592 --> 09:13.515
numbness in the toes and fingers?

09:13.595 --> 09:15.016
Probably.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.940
And temporary paralysis?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.018
Definitely.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.270
Shit.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.650
I told you.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.193
What are you talking about?

09:25.273 --> 09:27.651
Well, there...

09:28.318 --> 09:30.616
There might have been
some symptoms before today.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.781
Why wouldn't you get those checked out?

09:32.864 --> 09:35.993
- He sent me to Jenny Craig.
- Oh, my God.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.539
I thought it was a weight thing.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.498
- Dad, temporary paralysis?
- I didn't know.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.002
Jesus Christ, Dad!

09:42.082 --> 09:44.170
But I lost six pounds the first week.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.888
Okay, well, it seems like you guys
have some stuff to work out, so...

09:50.548 --> 09:52.300
A weight thing?

09:52.383 --> 09:55.262
- You thought it was a weight thing?
- Stop, stop.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.183
So, what is with you and Dad?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.017
He seems pretty pissed.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.979
He fired me, John.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.688
Fired you?

10:05.772 --> 10:07.485
I didn't even know you were working for him.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.990
Yeah, you should really call more, you know.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.531
- So, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.078
Well, then, why did you get fired?

10:17.158 --> 10:20.331
The business has been
operating at a loss for over a year.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.789
Dad's about three weeks away
from total bankruptcy.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.250
When I confronted him about it, he fires me.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.797
Wait. What? Are you kidding me?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.424
Just don't say anything, okay?

10:29.504 --> 10:31.632
He made me promise not to tell anyone.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.467
He doesn't want Mom
to worry about it right now.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.019
Well, what's he going to do?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.770
I don't know.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.807
Medical bills are going to be crazy.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.312
They don't have any savings.
They're totally screwed.

10:43.059 --> 10:47.280
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.406
So, how's Rebecca?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.492
- She's good.
- Yeah?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.245
Mom said things haven't been great.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.576
Is that why you're not going to get married?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.998
I don't even know
why you would say that. I...

11:02.078 --> 11:04.417
Do you think
your kid will mind being a bastard?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.751
Okay, first of all, I'm pretty sure
people don't think like that anymore.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.799
And, two, no. I don't... I don't know.

11:10.879 --> 11:11.971
You sure?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.135
Well, I'll ask him when he gets here.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.592
What are you doing?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.849
Stacey started seeing somebody.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.559
- This is Stacey's house?
- Yeah.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.562
Ron, you divorced her, like, years ago.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.772
I agreed to divorce.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.567
I didn't agree to some strange man
hanging around my daughters.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.569
Okay, Ron, we got to go. This is...

11:31.649 --> 11:33.696
- Shit! Get down! Get down!
- What? What? What is it?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.028
- John, get down.
- What?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.950
- He's at the window.
- Oh, my God, mine doesn't work.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.201
- What?
- Mine doesn't work.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.702
- Don't grab... Put it down.
- My seat doesn't work.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.371
My seat... He's coming. He's coming.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.828
He's coming. He's coming.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.128
He's coming over?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.626
- Is he coming over?
- Oh, my God, Ron. I'm going to kill you.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.707
I'm going to kill you.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.254
- This is very...
- Just be cool.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.211
- This is very upsetting to me.
- Be cool.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.420
This is...

11:52.503 --> 11:54.597
This is not good. This...

11:56.716 --> 11:58.054
Hey.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.806
Hey there, Ron.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.683
- How you doing?
- Fine.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.265
Wait. You guys know each other?

12:03.348 --> 12:04.850
Yeah.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.982
He's the new youth pastor
over at Mom and Dad's church.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.438
Reverend Dan. Nice to meet you.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.569
Hey. John Hollar.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.866
I'm embarrassed.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.194
I heard about your mother.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.240
I'm very sorry.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.698
Thank you very much.
That's nice of you to say.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.449
How is she?

12:21.532 --> 12:23.284
- You know, I think...
- She's fine.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.415
No thanks to you.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.917
Well, he didn't do anything, Ron.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.836
Yeah? How do you know?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.589
He's supposed to talk to God, isn't he?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.422
Maybe he put in an order
for a brain tumor or something.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.302
I'm afraid that's not
how it works there, Ron.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.383
Yeah?

12:38.466 --> 12:41.094
How does it work, Reverend Dan? Tell us.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.058
Well, I'm just a youth pastor, so...

12:44.138 --> 12:45.810
Really? What's the matter?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.143
Couldn't get a job as an adult pastor?

12:49.352 --> 12:52.775
No, I just... Yeah. I like kids.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.818
That's nice.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.368
Yeah? That's creepy. That's creepy.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.742
Yeah, look, Ron...

13:00.613 --> 13:02.115
I know you're going through
a hard time right now,

13:02.198 --> 13:03.575
- okay?
- Really? You do?

13:03.658 --> 13:06.080
Yeah, yeah, I do.
And I appreciate that very much.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.787
- However...
- Yeah?

13:07.870 --> 13:11.750
Stacey was wondering if you could maybe...

13:12.542 --> 13:14.881
Stop parking out in front of the house

13:14.961 --> 13:17.885
and staring at her with your binoculars.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.225
Yeah?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.188
Well, fuck you, Reverend Dan!

13:28.683 --> 13:29.809
What happened?

13:29.892 --> 13:30.984
I don't know.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.318
I mean, it sounded like you...
You have a broken T-chain there.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.777
I could... I mean, I could take
a look at it for you if you want?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.072
That would be helpful. Thank you.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.660
Yeah.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.957
Pop the hood.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.126
- This guy...
- Shut your mouth.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.069
You can have our old room. I'm in the den.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.244
Wait. You live here now?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.621
We're in a recession!

15:24.215 --> 15:25.637
Dad.

15:26.676 --> 15:27.928
Dad.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.639
What time is it?

15:30.721 --> 15:31.973
It's 8:00.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.269
Shit, shit.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.976
Shit, I'm late for work. Shit.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.060
No, don't worry about it.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.940
Look, I got your briefcase right here.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.317
Coffee.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.448
- Thank you, John.
- Yeah, you got it.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.912
So, just go to work
and I'll stay here with Mom.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.664
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.662
I just don't know what I'd do if I lost her.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.994
Dad.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.580
Dad, you can't think like that.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.379
I know.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.756
It's gonna be okay.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.304
It's gonna be okay. You'll see.

16:04.839 --> 16:05.840
I know.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.305
Yeah.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.236
And he's gone, so you can stop pretending.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.858
Thank God.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.738
How you doing?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.820
He cried all night.
If I didn't know any better,

16:27.904 --> 16:30.578
I'd think he was the one
with the brain tumor.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.118
I think he might be
going through a little something, so...

16:33.201 --> 16:35.078
Ron told you we're about to go bankrupt?

16:35.536 --> 16:36.999
Come on. He said no one knew.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.831
I keep the books.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.010
Is he gonna be all right?

16:43.669 --> 16:44.886
I don't know.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.674
I don't know.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.102
Well, I brought breakfast.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.932
Pretzels and ice cream?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.688
- If you don't want it, I can just...
- No, no, no.

16:58.768 --> 16:59.894
I'm not saying that.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.444
So, how you doing?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.693
I feel great.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.699
You know, I've been googling brain tumors.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.825
A lot more common than you'd think.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.281
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.409
Did you know Bob Marley had one?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.252
How'd that work out for him?

17:17.619 --> 17:21.624
Well, he sold a lot of records, so...
Got a little catching up to do.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.635
You're gonna be okay, Mom.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.929
You'll get through this.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.674
I mean, even the procedure seems simple.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.054
Just a tiny little hole
in your skull, and they go in and...

17:32.134 --> 17:33.135
John.

17:35.638 --> 17:36.981
How's Rebecca?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.892
She's good, you know...

17:41.143 --> 17:42.732
Hello.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.564
What's this, Mrs. Hollar?

17:44.647 --> 17:47.150
We're having some ice cream for breakfast?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.655
Ice cream and pretzels,
one of my mom's favorite things.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.450
Yeah. Hey, how 'bout heart attacks?

17:52.530 --> 17:54.368
Is that one of her favorite things, too?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.416
No. What? Why?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.499
Why? Well, because
your mother's a borderline diabetic.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.671
That's not true, is it?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.418
- Maybe.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.922
No, it is. So this probably
wasn't the best idea, was it, pal?

18:06.002 --> 18:07.629
I'm gonna take these.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.424
And, believe it or not, we actually keep our
patients on a pretty strict diet for a reason.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.305
Sorry. I was just trying to do
something nice for her, so...

18:14.385 --> 18:18.015
Next time, like, try a gift card
or something harmless, you know?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.898
I'm sorry,
do you have a problem with me or...

18:23.811 --> 18:25.939
I don't know. Maybe.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.774
Want... Want a little chat in the hall?

18:27.857 --> 18:29.029
We'll find out.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.697
I'll be right back.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.034
What's going on, man?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.664
"What's going on, man?"

18:40.036 --> 18:43.415
Well, Gwen has been
asking about you, like, nonstop

18:43.497 --> 18:44.874
since she found out your mom was here.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.629
Yeah. No, I heard you guys were...

18:46.709 --> 18:47.710
- Married?
- Yeah.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.757
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Congratulations.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.215
She just had a kid, too, so...

18:52.965 --> 18:54.717
Well, you both have a kid, so that...
That's awesome.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.847
Congratulations for both of you, right?

18:56.927 --> 19:00.017
Dude, please,
can we cut the shit here for a second?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.645
- Yeah.
- I mean, like, are you gonna try anything?

19:02.725 --> 19:04.647
- What?
- Are you gonna try anything with her

19:04.727 --> 19:06.604
- while you're in town?
- No, no, no.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.064
- No. No, no, no.
- Yeah?

19:08.147 --> 19:13.529
No, I... I have a great girl in New York,
and we're actually about to have a baby, so...

19:13.611 --> 19:14.863
Great. So you're married.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.615
No. No, we're not.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.746
I thought you said you...
You're gonna have a baby.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.495
I did say I was gonna have a baby, but...
I'm not married.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.580
Well, why aren't you getting married
if you're gonna have a kid?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.211
Well, it's a long story.
You know, we talked about it. But...

19:27.291 --> 19:28.793
- Why does that matter?
- I don't know.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.716
I'm just saying, don't you think your kid's
gonna resent you for making it a bastard?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.342
It's not gonna be a bastard.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.219
Technically, the kid will be a...
That's what a bastard is.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.096
Point is, I...
I haven't had any feelings for Gwen.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.177
Not for a long, long time.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.728
- So...
- Yeah.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.682
She still looks good.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.437
I... Bet she does.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.269
- Like, great.
- Okay.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.404
You know, maybe better than before.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.027
I don't even know what that means, but...

19:51.107 --> 19:52.609
In that case, you want to get dinner?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.485
What?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.529
Tomorrow night.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.659
Gwen wanted me
to invite you to dinner at our house.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.241
That's why we're chatting
out here in the hall.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.038
Yeah, no, I... Yeah, that would be nice.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.123
All right, good.
Well, I'll let her know you're coming.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.754
- Great. All right, well, it was good to see you.
- This is good.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.086
Yeah? Glad you like it.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.545
It's a nice combo.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.643
Where is everyone?

20:26.726 --> 20:27.813
Not here.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.981
Well, where are they?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.938
- Called in sick.
- Everyone?

20:31.355 --> 20:32.402
Why?

20:32.982 --> 20:36.447
I'm guessing it had something to do
with not getting paid for two weeks.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.075
Well, don't they know about Sally?

20:39.155 --> 20:43.501
Unfortunately, guilting people
into free labor only works on family.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.915
I wish I had more sisters.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.542
Yeah, me, too.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.749
How's she doing?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.344
I don't know.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.007
I better go check on her.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.259
No, I'll go check on her.
You need to get to work.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.842
We got an order this morning, thank God.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.307
All right. Here.

21:04.889 --> 21:09.188
Take this card
and pay everyone for last week.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.357
- You can't afford that.
- Just do it anyway.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.781
And tell 'em to get their asses back to work.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.484
Okay.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.580
What about your cartoon story?

21:23.032 --> 21:25.160
They don't call it a cartoon story, Mom.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.704
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.209
I mean, what's it called?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.791
A graphic novel.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.130
How is it?

21:38.005 --> 21:40.804
Let's face it, Mom, I made a mistake.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.517
I'm not an artist.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.060
And that's okay.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.402
Rebecca sent me some of it.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.610
Oh, my God, she did not.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.741
She says she thinks you should
try and get it published.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.868
Yeah. I bet she does.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.911
- Why don't you?
- Because, Mom,

22:05.991 --> 22:08.289
you know, sometimes
things aren't good enough.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.622
I like Rebecca.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.958
- She's pushy.
- Yeah.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.798
Men need to be pushed.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.725
You know, when your father and I
first got married, we lived in Detroit.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.184
He worked in a small office downtown

22:28.264 --> 22:30.517
next to the Fox Theatre.

22:32.977 --> 22:36.322
I'd pick him up every day.
He never really knew why.

22:37.398 --> 22:42.364
Your father would get off work at 5:00,
and I'd leave our apartment at 3:00

22:42.444 --> 22:44.867
and walk down to the Fox.

22:46.490 --> 22:50.120
There was never a show on at that time.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.375
And I'd go in

22:53.455 --> 22:56.254
and I'd sit in one of those seats.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.674
And I'd look up at the ceiling.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.806
It was...

23:06.886 --> 23:09.514
Unlike anything I'd ever seen.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.647
And this enormous chandelier.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.730
It was breathtaking.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.991
And every day, I'd go back,

23:21.901 --> 23:23.778
I'd go in,

23:24.653 --> 23:27.156
and I'd look up.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.244
You've never told me that story.

23:34.788 --> 23:38.713
I never really got a chance
to pursue anything creative.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.888
I was so young when I married your father,
and then Ronnie came along.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.845
So...

23:46.675 --> 23:48.973
Do you ever wish you did anything different?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.813
Yeah, big-time.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.854
- Really?
- Definitely. Definitely.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.772
Like what?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.522
I'm not sure I ever should
have married your father.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.654
Wait. What?

24:03.192 --> 24:04.738
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

24:04.818 --> 24:07.196
Girls! Oh, my goodness!

24:07.863 --> 24:10.116
What are you two doing out of school?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.288
I don't want you to die, Grandma.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.956
Don't you worry about that.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.538
But, Dad said you will.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.625
- Well, what does he know?
- We brought pretzels and ice cream.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.880
That is so sweet.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.129
Grandma, is that your tumor?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.390
Come here, honey, and give me a hug.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.222
Okay. I'm gonna go for a drive, so...

24:30.302 --> 24:32.179
- Do you need anything?
- I wouldn't mind a bag of Doritos.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.476
- I was asking Mom.
- No, honey, I'm fine.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.146
Okay. Great. I'll be right back, okay?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.194
- See you guys in a little bit!
- Bye-bye!

24:47.569 --> 24:48.570
Hello?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
Thank God you're there.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.201
It is so good to hear your voice.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.706
Hey. How are you?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.579
Not so good.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.709
Doctor wants to do a craniotomy
by the end of the week.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.840
Dad is... Gonna lose his business, I think.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.720
And... Mom said she actually thinks
she regrets marrying him.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.720
It's been great. And on top of it all,
my mom's nurse hates me.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.517
Wait, why does your mom's nurse hate you?

25:15.597 --> 25:18.395
Who knows?
It's just some jackass from high school.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.773
Well, what's his problem?
You need me to come down there?

25:21.395 --> 25:24.399
I don't know, you know? Nothing.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.609
He's married to Gwen.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.653
Gwen...

25:29.653 --> 25:31.405
Gwen. Your Gwen.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.742
Well, it's not my Gwen anymore.

25:34.825 --> 25:35.951
Right? So...

25:36.035 --> 25:38.832
Well, no, yeah, but...

25:38.912 --> 25:40.000
Oh, boy.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.957
Look, Rebecca, don't worry.
Nothing is gonna happen.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.755
I don't feel anything for her anymore, okay?

25:44.835 --> 25:47.384
I mean, she just had a baby, for God's sake.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.303
Yeah.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.013
What an incredibly...

25:53.093 --> 25:55.933
Insensitive thing to say to me right now.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.602
No, that's not what I meant. I...

25:58.682 --> 25:59.774
What is that sound?

26:01.018 --> 26:02.110
Are you smoking?

26:02.811 --> 26:04.858
No. Yes.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.656
You don't smoke.

26:07.232 --> 26:11.323
Can you just put that out, please,
and just call me a little later?

26:11.403 --> 26:14.243
Okay, Rebecca, I didn't mean to...

26:14.323 --> 26:16.120
No, I... It... I'm...

26:16.200 --> 26:18.453
I'm fine. I just...
I need to get back to work.

26:19.953 --> 26:20.916
Okay.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.498
Okay. I love you. Bye.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.543
Stupid.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.762
Look, Don, I...

26:29.671 --> 26:31.844
I don't think I can get them
to give you another loan,

26:31.924 --> 26:33.926
given your current financial status.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.974
Business is picking up.
Yeah, no, I should've told you.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.519
Yeah. In fact, I'm gonna hire a new salesman.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.438
Soon to drum up some more business.

26:42.518 --> 26:46.398
Jim, I need to cover payroll for a month

26:46.480 --> 26:47.481
and that's it.

26:48.232 --> 26:51.202
Well, I... I wish there was
something I could do.

26:51.527 --> 26:52.699
Jim,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.743
I'm a member of the chamber of commerce.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.621
I can't even take my own kids out for dinner.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.041
Look, Don, you may be uncomfortable
talking about this, but...

27:03.038 --> 27:07.088
At this point, filing for bankruptcy,
it might be your safest option.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.511
- Bankruptcy?
- Yeah.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.262
I gave my life to this business.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.060
I gave my life!

27:18.762 --> 27:20.730
Wasn't supposed to be like this!

27:23.684 --> 27:25.231
I'm sorry, Don.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.785
I don't know if you heard.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.412
Sally's really sick.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.419
Yeah, I know.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.414
I'm very sorry.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.173
Okay.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.427
- Thanks, Jim.
- All right.

29:08.789 --> 29:09.961
Perfect.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.489
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.158
You remember that one?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.625
Oh, my God.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.126
- There you are.
- Hey, Mom.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.170
I have been looking all over for you girls.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.422
What are you doing?
Why didn't you go to school today?

29:55.502 --> 29:57.220
Dad brought us here instead.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.266
You can't take our kids out of school
without calling me, Ron.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.638
Grandma has a tumor.
It's the size of a basketball in her head.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.019
It's only a softball, actually.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.229
Sally...

30:10.767 --> 30:12.235
I'm so sorry.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.401
Thank you, Stacey.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.485
What is he doing here?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.863
Can I talk to you for a second? Alone?

30:20.986 --> 30:22.203
Okay.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.169
What the hell are you doing?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.046
You are scaring the girls,
not to mention your mom.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.970
- What do you care?
- Come on, Ron, don't be a child.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.300
- What did you bring him here for?
- I was worried.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.429
- He comforted me.
- He comf...

30:44.509 --> 30:46.887
He comforted you? The reverend?

30:49.431 --> 30:51.270
So are you...

30:51.350 --> 30:53.603
- Serious now?
- Ron.

30:54.311 --> 30:58.407
You were the one who wanted
a divorce in the first place.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.367
What if I wanted to change my mind?

31:05.447 --> 31:07.415
Change your mind about what?

31:08.575 --> 31:09.701
You know...

31:11.912 --> 31:13.289
Us.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.129
You and me and...

31:17.209 --> 31:18.552
The girls.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.304
Are you kidding me?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.517
I just wasn't ready.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.243
I know you think you're hot shit
ever since you moved to New York,

31:48.323 --> 31:50.246
but don't be an asshole, okay?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.332
This guy's got Mom's life in his hands.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.335
What are you talking about?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.718
I don't think I'm hot shit.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.133
Sure you do. You think you're better than us.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.634
That's why you never call.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.011
Here we go. I don't call

32:06.091 --> 32:08.430
just because I don't use
the phone that much anymore.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.057
You used to call Gwen all the time.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.389
She was my girlfriend!

32:13.348 --> 32:14.436
It's okay.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.644
It's okay. I understand. Leave it.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.353
Understand what?

32:19.312 --> 32:20.655
You're jealous.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.067
Of you?

32:24.151 --> 32:26.114
You live in Mom and Dad's basement.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.909
You resent me, don't you?
You resent all of us.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.452
That is why you moved so far away.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.245
I moved to New York
because there's nothing here.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.793
There's nothing here?

32:37.372 --> 32:39.544
Well, whatever.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.877
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.638
I don't care, either.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.096
Just don't offend this guy, okay?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.098
- How can I help you?
- Yes, thank you for taking the time.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.304
My brother and I were just wondering

32:52.387 --> 32:54.139
if you could explain
the procedure a little bit more...

32:54.222 --> 32:55.394
I wasn't wondering.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.313
I trust you.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.361
My mom and dad trust you, too.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.572
Well, thank you.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.192
- The procedure.
- Yeah.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.072
So, what we plan on doing...

33:07.152 --> 33:10.117
- I took karate as a kid.
- Ron.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.661
My instructor was actually black,

33:12.741 --> 33:15.870
but I'm pretty sure
he spent some time in China.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.250
- Why?
- With the Chinese.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.502
Well, I'm Taiwanese Laoshan.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.798
- Taiwanese Laoshan.
- So, doesn't apply.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.174
Doesn't apply.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.300
You're lotion?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.257
It's pronounced "Lau Shan."

33:29.841 --> 33:31.559
What martial art do you do?

33:32.761 --> 33:33.978
None.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.015
None.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.058
None?

33:38.683 --> 33:42.813
Okay, so the difficulty here is
that the tumor is taking up a large part...

33:42.896 --> 33:44.523
Does it help to have small hands?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.194
- You're a very busy guy.
- In... In the surgery?

33:46.274 --> 33:47.526
Thank you so much for taking the time,

33:47.609 --> 33:49.282
and we really appreciate
all you're doing for our mom.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.827
Hey, Gwen.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.037
Hey.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.669
Hey.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.335
This is for you.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.214
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.260
What are you doing here?

34:10.340 --> 34:12.388
You... You invited me to dinner.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.556
What day is it today?

34:14.928 --> 34:16.475
I'm just busting your balls, man.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.389
- That right?
- Yeah.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.895
All right.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.476
Are those for Gwen, or...

34:21.560 --> 34:23.312
No, they're... Well, yeah.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.148
They're for both of you,
so, you know, there you go.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.692
Yeah.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.572
All right, well,
I'll find a nice place for these.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.574
- Come on in. Gwen's getting ready, and...
- Great.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.496
- Yeah, do...
- Nice house.

34:36.366 --> 34:37.661
Beautiful place.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.664
- Thanks. Yeah.
- Look out.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.371
- Is that your baby?
- Nah, real kid's in the fridge.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.550
It's just a screaming decoy.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.422
What's... What's the name?

34:48.503 --> 34:49.629
Quinn.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.340
- Yeah.
- He's adorable.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.016
No, it's a she.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.931
We named her after Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman, you know,

34:57.012 --> 35:00.266
because... 'Cause it seemed like a funny idea

35:00.348 --> 35:02.225
- at the time.
- It's good. I think it's clever.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.105
You don't really think
that far ahead and then...

35:04.185 --> 35:06.187
- Yeah. It's a good show.
- It's the kid's name forever, but...

35:06.271 --> 35:08.148
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You want a beer, or...

35:08.231 --> 35:09.232
- I'd love that.
- All right.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.403
- Thank you so much.
- You got it.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.110
Now, is she okay?

35:12.193 --> 35:14.366
- 'Cause she seems upset.
- No, she's good.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.574
The crying's actually, like,
good for kids' lungs.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.910
It makes them
strong or something, you know.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.911
All right.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.464
Well, I don't think that's true.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.170
Right?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.756
Hi. You okay?

35:29.586 --> 35:32.260
- You okay?
- She likes you.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.008
Hey.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.635
Hey.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.686
You look... Beautiful.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.358
Well, I look... Different.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.486
So, how are you?

35:51.566 --> 35:54.364
Good. Good.
Little weird to be home, you know?

35:54.444 --> 35:55.821
You have an amazing-looking child...

35:57.238 --> 35:59.661
- Your husband's right in the kitchen.
- Yeah. It's not working out.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.663
But, he could come in, and any moment...

36:01.743 --> 36:04.371
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.126
You should have called me.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.378
I know.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.004
Have you ever read this?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.633
Yes, that is my favorite one.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.215
- Yeah, I thought you might like it.
- Yeah.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.925
Really? I think that book's depressing.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.302
You think everything's depressing.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.230
Well, you've seen Seven, right?

36:22.472 --> 36:24.144
- I have, yeah.
- Whatever.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.562
How did you get Quinn to stop crying?

36:25.642 --> 36:27.064
Oh, I didn't. John did it.

36:28.937 --> 36:32.111
What, are you, like,
some kind of baby whisperer guy, or...

36:32.899 --> 36:34.651
No. No.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.361
Jason can never get her to stop crying.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.913
Really? Well, that's probably just bad luck.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.873
Yeah, I mean...

36:41.783 --> 36:43.160
It's just bad luck.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.790
- You hungry?
- Starving.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.542
- Yeah, let's eat.
- Okay, great.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.124
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

36:49.916 --> 36:53.590
Okay, kiddo, it's bedtime for you.
You want...

36:53.670 --> 36:55.092
Are you kidding me?

36:56.256 --> 36:58.053
It was really good. Thank you very much.

36:58.133 --> 37:01.056
So, what's the story with your girlfriend?

37:01.136 --> 37:02.809
Why didn't she come back with you?

37:03.304 --> 37:04.681
Girlfriend?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.270
- Yeah, I didn't tell you?
- No.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.603
Yeah. No, they're gonna
have a kid together and everything.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.778
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:14.858 --> 37:15.859
Thank you.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.536
- So, when's she due?
- Soon, very soon.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.739
They're not even married.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.869
Well, you know, we...

37:22.949 --> 37:25.914
Really wanting a bastard, so we got it.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.708
I proposed to Gwen the second
I saw the pregnancy test in the trash.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.415
I jumped on it,
'cause you don't want to, you know...

37:30.498 --> 37:31.670
That's romantic.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.088
- Yeah.
- So, how'd you meet her?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.262
At a comic book store, actually.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.089
She like a... Like a nerd or...

37:39.841 --> 37:43.015
No, she's... Adorable.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.559
Okay.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.140
What she do?

37:47.807 --> 37:49.771
She has her own company, actually.

37:49.851 --> 37:50.939
Doing what?

37:51.019 --> 37:52.896
She designs pet clothing.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.989
So, just collars and hats and sweaters and...

37:59.986 --> 38:01.033
Nice.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.703
You can make a living
designing pet clothing in New York?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.206
- That's...
- No, not... Not really.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.210
I don't understand then.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.550
Her parents are rich-ish.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.297
How rich?

38:16.377 --> 38:18.596
They bought her
a brownstone for graduation.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.019
Okay. Well, now I see why
you don't want to get married.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.725
Why is that?

38:27.263 --> 38:30.893
Well, it's like, what's the point, really?
Going through all that, you know?

38:31.267 --> 38:34.065
Getting everything you want out of it,
and she's taking care of you, so...

38:34.145 --> 38:35.442
- Jason.
- What?

38:35.897 --> 38:37.649
Well, no, no, it's not... It's not like that.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.946
I mean, we keep our money separate, so...

38:40.026 --> 38:41.573
But you don't have any money.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.654
You're drunk.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.246
So?

38:44.739 --> 38:46.662
So go do the dishes, okay?

38:48.535 --> 38:49.536
Okay.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.168
Right. Okay. Sure.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.134
- You don't have any money, right?
- Jason.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.427
Okay.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.101
John! Oh, my God!

39:10.181 --> 39:12.559
I haven't heard from you in, like, two days!
I've been worried!

39:12.642 --> 39:14.485
Rebecca, I just saw Gwen.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.023
I went over to her house for dinner,
her and her husband, he was there.

39:18.106 --> 39:22.156
And okay, honey,
I'll just tell you, she kissed me!

39:23.778 --> 39:25.200
Okay.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.828
Okay, so... You kissed her?

39:28.908 --> 39:30.125
No, no, no, she kissed me.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.998
No. Major difference.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.079
Major.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.628
I just thought that you said
you didn't have feelings for her anymore,

39:36.708 --> 39:39.172
and she just had a kid.

39:39.252 --> 39:40.924
I don't. She did.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.257
By the way, she still looks great!

39:43.339 --> 39:46.684
Meant to tell you that, so,
you have nothing to worry about.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.267
Dude, what?

39:49.762 --> 39:52.352
John, you sound like a basket case.

39:52.432 --> 39:56.022
No. No, no. I know exactly
what I'm saying, I promise.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.900
You're not making me
feel very secure right now.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.069
I know. I know, but I will.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.402
I will, starting right now.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.071
Are you drunk?

40:06.154 --> 40:08.657
A little bit, but no,
that's not why I'm saying this.

40:09.157 --> 40:12.912
Rebecca, what I'm trying to tell you is...
I love you.

40:12.994 --> 40:17.332
I love you, and I don't know,
I just wanted you to know that.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.918
I love you, too.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.128
Dad?

40:22.211 --> 40:24.551
Hey, Johnny, what's going on?

40:24.631 --> 40:25.678
What are you doing here?

40:25.965 --> 40:27.592
- John?
- I'm working.

40:28.843 --> 40:29.844
John?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.680
Rebecca, I have to call you back.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.649
Are you kidding me, John?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.108
Dad, I can give you some money.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.532
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't have any money.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.986
- Rebecca has some money...
- I'm not going to take any money from her.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.571
John, come on.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.116
You got your own family to worry about now.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.496
I'll figure this out.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.832
- How?
- Well, I'll, you know...

40:55.912 --> 40:57.789
Dad... How?

40:57.872 --> 40:59.169
Well...

41:05.380 --> 41:06.757
I'm sorry.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.886
That I didn't spend more time
with you growing up.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.434
Come on, Dad,
you know I don't care about that.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.100
Yeah, well, I do.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.567
Johnny, it's terrifying.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.115
It's not that bad.

41:24.941 --> 41:28.364
- How much do you owe?
- No, not that, no.

41:28.444 --> 41:33.075
It's terrifying to find out
this late in your life

41:33.157 --> 41:34.579
what you should have done.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.963
We still have time.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.898
I tried, you know. I did try.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.103
You got to know that.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.030
- I do.
- Yeah.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.797
John.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.047
- John.
- Hi.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.131
Hi.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.678
- Is this a dream?
- No.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.265
Why is he wearing my mother's robe?

42:36.345 --> 42:37.433
Hi.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.727
I'm Ron, John's brother.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.397
- It is so good to finally meet you.
- Hey, Ron?

42:42.477 --> 42:44.440
- Yeah.
- I think we got it from here, bud.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.773
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.733
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.989
So, don't ever hang up on me again, okay?

42:51.986 --> 42:53.283
- No, I won't.
- Okay.

42:54.822 --> 42:55.823
Wait.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.371
- How did you get here?
- I took a cab.

42:58.451 --> 42:59.539
How far is that?

42:59.619 --> 43:00.745
Far.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.001
What are these?

43:04.499 --> 43:07.046
I was thinking maybe
some wallpaper for the baby's room.

43:07.126 --> 43:10.050
I read somewhere that babies like contrast.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.717
They're beautiful.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.145
- I missed you so much.
- I really missed you.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.475
How are you feeling?

43:19.555 --> 43:20.977
My ass is really sore.

43:23.184 --> 43:25.061
Cannot believe you took a cab here.

44:15.528 --> 44:16.575
Hey.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.038
Dad?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.747
Hi, angels.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.540
What are you doing here?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.622
I missed you guys.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.044
Did you miss me?

44:28.124 --> 44:30.126
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Can I come in?

44:32.962 --> 44:33.963
Yeah.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.635
- I'm coming in.
- But, Mom said that...

44:35.715 --> 44:37.592
Don't... Don't worry about Mom.
Move-move that.

44:38.134 --> 44:39.180
Okay.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.386
Coming in.

44:40.469 --> 44:41.561
Okay.

44:42.555 --> 44:44.268
Okay. Here we go.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.941
I'm good. Okay.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.317
Don't wake Mommy.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.444
Okay.

44:53.441 --> 44:54.529
Okay.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.282
Hi. Hi-ho.

44:57.278 --> 44:58.780
Slumber party.

44:58.863 --> 44:59.989
Get in here.

45:00.072 --> 45:01.198
Oh, my goodness.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.745
I missed you guys.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.293
I missed you.

45:05.119 --> 45:06.291
I love you.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.305
What? What is it?

45:21.761 --> 45:23.263
Is it... Is it a kick?

45:23.346 --> 45:25.393
No, it felt like a stab.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.646
- Is that normal?
- I don't know.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.227
Oh, my God.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.606
It's from being in the car so long.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.313
I don't think that's what that is.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.568
- That's not helping.
- Okay.

45:33.648 --> 45:34.900
Is this real?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.734
Well, it feels real.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.365
All right. Sorry. Yep.

45:39.445 --> 45:40.571
- Yep.
- Okay...

45:40.655 --> 45:42.243
Constance.

45:42.323 --> 45:43.825
Matilda.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.410
Wake up, it's time for school.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.627
What the hell are you doing here?

45:51.707 --> 45:53.421
Okay, okay, just hear me out.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.547
Ron!

45:54.627 --> 45:55.879
Stacey, please.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.972
- John?
- How is she?

46:06.055 --> 46:07.727
She's fine. She just needs to rest.

46:07.807 --> 46:09.020
Good.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.477
You can take her home tomorrow.

46:10.559 --> 46:11.685
Thank you.

46:11.769 --> 46:15.148
And the... Baby... Is okay?

46:15.231 --> 46:16.778
Their vitals are good.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.029
"Their vitals?"

46:22.363 --> 46:24.115
Did you know we were having twins?

46:29.328 --> 46:30.420
Yeah.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.550
And you didn't tell me because...

46:37.545 --> 46:41.215
It was the same day,
when we found out about your mom.

46:43.342 --> 46:44.594
And...

46:45.052 --> 46:46.804
Honestly, with everything
you've been going through,

46:46.887 --> 46:49.310
I can't even tell
if you want to have a baby at all.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.103
So I thought
if you knew that it was two, you'd...

46:51.183 --> 46:53.311
It would be too much.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.816
Wait. "Everything I'm going through?"

46:55.896 --> 46:58.399
You're not happy, John. It's obvious.

47:00.484 --> 47:01.861
At work, in your life and...

47:01.944 --> 47:04.038
I don't know, maybe with me.

47:05.239 --> 47:06.535
And I know that you're...

47:06.615 --> 47:08.663
- No, I...
- Just going through something and

47:08.743 --> 47:13.797
maybe everything in your life isn't
exactly what you want it to be right now.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.834
And you're scared and I get that.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.294
Having a baby is scary.

47:18.377 --> 47:21.551
And you think that
everything's gonna change and...

47:22.631 --> 47:23.757
We're not gonna be fun anymore

47:23.841 --> 47:26.681
and you're not gonna drink beer
with your friends and you're gonna

47:26.761 --> 47:29.139
have to be stuck in this job that you hate

47:29.221 --> 47:32.183
and you're not gonna kiss your high
school sweetheart ever again...

47:32.266 --> 47:33.938
- Becca, that's not...
- No, I'm saying...

47:34.018 --> 47:35.144
I'm saying it's fine.

47:36.604 --> 47:40.069
And we're gonna work through all of it
and you don't need to worry.

47:40.149 --> 47:41.366
Okay?

47:42.234 --> 47:44.032
That's not what I'm worried about.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.120
Okay. It's not?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.201
No.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.038
I don't care about any of that.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.712
Having twins is...

47:57.792 --> 48:00.170
Is one more person and...

48:01.796 --> 48:03.764
That's one more person that...

48:06.550 --> 48:08.427
I'm gonna be failing.

48:09.178 --> 48:11.306
And I just don't know if I can take that.

48:14.183 --> 48:15.435
What?

48:15.518 --> 48:16.861
Is that what you think?

48:19.480 --> 48:21.198
I don't know, yeah.

48:24.693 --> 48:28.909
I didn't drive eight hours
'cause you were failing me.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.117
I came here 'cause I need you

48:31.659 --> 48:33.081
so much.

48:38.707 --> 48:40.835
I'm just waiting for you to come back.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.511
Okay.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.553
Okay.

48:56.767 --> 48:57.980
I need you to get me
out of this hospital, though.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.061
Okay.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.358
- For real.
- Okay.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.941
I'm not having two of your enormous babies

49:03.023 --> 49:05.367
- without my doctor, you monster.
- Okay.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.533
I'm not doing it. It's not funny.

49:10.614 --> 49:14.372
You are not allowed in this house again
under any circumstance, do you understand?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.671
Come on, Stacey,
don't you think you're overreacting?

49:22.710 --> 49:24.548
Watch the flowers, please.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.050
Come on, man.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.357
- Dan, good to see you.
- Good morning.

49:45.441 --> 49:46.487
Good to see you.

49:46.567 --> 49:48.240
Damn it! Damn it!

49:55.576 --> 49:56.953
Jesus.

49:57.745 --> 49:58.871
Shit.

50:00.206 --> 50:02.959
You know what? You win, man.

50:03.042 --> 50:04.214
Okay?

50:05.753 --> 50:06.879
You win.

50:08.422 --> 50:09.593
This isn't about me.

50:09.673 --> 50:11.345
Yeah, whatever.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.893
Your girls called me.

50:16.263 --> 50:17.389
They called you?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.393
What were you doing in the house, Ron?

50:21.477 --> 50:22.694
I don't know!

50:23.395 --> 50:26.774
I was lonely,
and I... I didn't know where else to go,

50:26.857 --> 50:28.734
and... And they're... They're my kids.

50:28.817 --> 50:31.115
I mean, they're... They're my kids, too.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.201
Would you like to talk about it?

50:34.281 --> 50:35.498
No. No.

50:38.202 --> 50:41.125
I mean, kind of, but...

50:41.205 --> 50:43.583
Hey, come on.
I'm gonna buy you a cup of coffee.

50:43.666 --> 50:44.667
- No.
- Come on.

50:44.750 --> 50:45.963
No, it's okay. I'm okay.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.169
I'm good.

50:58.722 --> 50:59.848
Thank you, Mike.

51:02.935 --> 51:05.900
Wait, you're not gonna push any
of that Jesus shit on me, are you?

51:05.980 --> 51:07.152
No.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.192
You promise?

51:10.150 --> 51:12.027
I don't force my beliefs on people, Ron.

51:13.445 --> 51:14.867
Really?

51:14.947 --> 51:16.164
Really.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.243
What are your beliefs?

51:27.459 --> 51:28.756
Mom?

51:29.962 --> 51:31.214
What are you doing up?

51:37.011 --> 51:39.264
- Where is everyone?
- Gone.

51:42.433 --> 51:43.854
Mom, what's wrong?

51:43.934 --> 51:46.357
Dr. Fong just came by.

51:47.605 --> 51:48.777
And?

51:50.357 --> 51:53.577
He said they might have to shave my head.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.074
Well, Mom,

51:59.158 --> 52:00.751
that's okay.

52:01.410 --> 52:02.878
I don't want to do it, Johnny.

52:05.539 --> 52:07.212
Look ridiculous.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.969
Look like Rod Steiger.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.546
No.

52:12.630 --> 52:13.801
Yes, I will.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.258
No, you won't.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.303
When are they coming to do it?

52:19.720 --> 52:20.972
I don't know.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.224
I'll just stay right here until they do.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.359
How are you?

52:32.149 --> 52:33.947
We're having twins.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.322
And you're terrified.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.807
Don't worry.

52:57.883 --> 53:00.472
You won't know till you get there

53:00.552 --> 53:02.520
that you're okay.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.683
Okay, Mrs. Hollar,
you ready for your new 'do?

53:09.395 --> 53:12.023
Hey, man.

53:13.107 --> 53:16.697
Look, I... I got to give
your mom a haircut, so...

53:16.777 --> 53:18.495
- You want to hop over here?
- Yeah.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.951
Easy as pie.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.658
Hop on in.

53:24.576 --> 53:26.874
Just gonna pop this on...

53:26.954 --> 53:29.127
Real easy.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.293
And we'll get you done in no time.

53:32.376 --> 53:35.129
Nothing to it, nice and easy.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.509
You ready?

53:37.589 --> 53:38.886
All right, here we go.

53:41.552 --> 53:42.644
Wait.

53:44.430 --> 53:45.807
I'll do it.

53:47.474 --> 53:48.600
Yeah?

53:48.684 --> 53:51.904
Yeah, just leave the clippers
and I'll give her the haircut.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.858
If that's all right with you.

53:57.609 --> 53:58.735
All right.

55:05.761 --> 55:06.762
How do I look?

55:08.180 --> 55:09.306
Beautiful.

55:09.389 --> 55:11.517
- You're just saying that.
- No, I'm not.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.149
You have a really nicely-shaped head.

55:14.853 --> 55:16.105
Well, thank you.

55:22.194 --> 55:23.946
Give me my lipstick.

55:34.248 --> 55:35.545
Well, what now?

55:36.083 --> 55:37.546
I don't know.

55:37.626 --> 55:39.128
Wait for supper.

55:39.211 --> 55:40.212
It's my last meal.

55:40.295 --> 55:41.922
What do you mean, your last meal?

55:42.005 --> 55:44.219
They're not letting me
have any food tomorrow.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.722
I guess you're not supposed
to eat before the surgery.

55:47.302 --> 55:49.555
Well, what's on the menu for tonight?

55:49.638 --> 55:51.766
Yogurt and a boiled egg.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.102
Well, that's not a good last meal.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.857
No kidding.

56:00.232 --> 56:01.324
Let's go.

56:02.109 --> 56:03.322
What? Now?

56:03.402 --> 56:04.494
Yeah.

56:04.945 --> 56:06.788
They're never letting me leave.

56:07.573 --> 56:08.699
I'm gonna sneak you out of here.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.455
You'll get in trouble!

56:10.951 --> 56:14.251
I'm not letting you have
a yogurt and an egg for dinner.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.459
Excuse me.

56:25.966 --> 56:26.929
Push, push, push.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.010
You can't be in here.

56:28.093 --> 56:29.515
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.222
- No, no. Get out.
- Sorry.

56:31.305 --> 56:32.306
So sorry.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.641
- So sorry.
- Sorry. Yeah.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.021
You're doing great.

56:37.978 --> 56:39.195
This is for 310.

56:41.356 --> 56:43.028
No, no, no. Hey. Hey, hey!

56:43.108 --> 56:44.360
Hey!

56:47.738 --> 56:50.161
John! You're going so fast.

56:57.331 --> 56:59.083
We did it. We did it. We got away.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.460
Wait, wait, wait! No, come on!

57:01.543 --> 57:04.137
You can't leave the hospital...
What an asshole.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.093
What an asshole.

57:09.009 --> 57:10.511
Oh, my God.

57:11.511 --> 57:14.811
I haven't been to this place
in a really long, long time.

57:17.059 --> 57:19.606
I think those women think
I just escaped from...

57:19.686 --> 57:21.313
A mental institution.

57:23.690 --> 57:25.112
I don't even think they've noticed.

57:25.192 --> 57:26.660
Which scares me more.

57:30.322 --> 57:32.120
Mom, what did you mean

57:32.783 --> 57:36.037
when you said
you might have regretted marrying Dad?

57:36.870 --> 57:38.213
Did I say that?

57:38.956 --> 57:40.253
Yes.

57:41.041 --> 57:42.463
Must've been the tumor.

57:43.627 --> 57:44.799
Mom.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.052
You never met my mother.

57:49.216 --> 57:50.388
She was tough.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.433
Quiet, but tough.

57:54.763 --> 57:57.311
The day I married your dad,

57:57.391 --> 57:59.985
she only had one piece of advice for me.

58:00.769 --> 58:03.272
"Don't waste your time with the bad.

58:03.355 --> 58:04.823
"Live with the good."

58:05.524 --> 58:07.242
So...

58:08.068 --> 58:13.416
Your father and I have lived through
38 good years together.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.413
I love this place.

58:20.163 --> 58:21.376
Hi.

58:21.456 --> 58:22.878
Boy, we thought we missed you.

58:23.375 --> 58:24.672
Hey.

58:27.087 --> 58:28.259
Nice haircut.

58:29.923 --> 58:31.470
What do you think, Donald?

58:32.217 --> 58:34.015
I think you look great, Chief.

58:50.277 --> 58:52.199
Who do you think I look like?

58:52.279 --> 58:54.031
It's weird, but you remind me of my wife.

58:54.114 --> 58:56.242
That's... I knew you were gonna say that!

59:21.141 --> 59:23.018
Rebecca...

59:23.101 --> 59:25.354
You're so good for him.

59:25.437 --> 59:26.654
Love you.

59:28.231 --> 59:29.608
What time is it?

59:30.567 --> 59:31.905
It's 8:30.

59:31.985 --> 59:33.111
So...

59:33.987 --> 59:35.989
Thanks for being here, everyone.

59:38.116 --> 59:40.414
We love you, Mom.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.962
I love you guys.

59:43.830 --> 59:44.877
Don...

59:45.582 --> 59:48.171
It's gonna be fine. I'm going to be okay.

59:48.251 --> 59:49.468
I'm...

59:50.462 --> 59:52.556
I'm so sorry about Jenny Craig.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.179
Come here.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.518
Take care of Ron for me.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.936
He needs your help.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.313
Okay.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.990
Chief.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.665
It's been on there so long.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:22.369
Hold it for me.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.126
Take care of your dad for me.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.927
He needs your help.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.972
I got it.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.765
Take care of both of them.

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:46.689
They need you.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.067
You got it.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.995
Okay, are we ready, Mrs. Hollar?

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.618
Ready, Mom?

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.079
I don't...

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:07.797
Mrs. Hollar?

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:10.960
I don't want to do this.

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:12.631
Okay. Okay.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.299
- I don't want to do this.
- It's okay.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.847
I don't want to do this.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:18.845
I don't want to do this!

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.472
It's okay.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.269
Mom, you're gonna be fine. Okay?

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:30.524
I'm trying to tell you
something 'bout my life

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:31.566
No!

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.360
Maybe give me insights

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.442
Between black and white

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:40.781
The best thing you ever done for me

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.495
ls to help me take my life less seriously

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:48.171
it's only life after all

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.794
Yeah.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.631
Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.174
Is that the Indigo Girls?

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:57.881
Yeah. She loves this song.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.716
That's hard to hear

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:04.724
And I wrap my fear
around me like a blanket

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:08.854
And I sailed my ship
of safety till I sank it

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:12.564
I'm crawling on your shores

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.068
I went to the doctor

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.320
I went to the mountains

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.823
I looked to the children

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.367
I drank from the fountains

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:26.246
There's more than one answer
to these questions

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:29.499
Pointing me in a crooked line

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.877
And the less I seek my source

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.584
- For some definitive
- My source

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:37.797
The closer I am to fine

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:44.431
I went to see the doctor of philosophy

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:46.433
With a poster of Rasputin

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.392
And a beard down to his knee

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.602
He never did marry

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.313
Or see a B-grade movie

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:56.610
He graded my performance

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.778
He said he could see through me

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:02.449
I spent four years prostrate
To the higher mind

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.203
Got my paper and I was free

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.955
I went to the doctor

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.333
I went to the mountains

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:13.960
I looked to the children

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.254
I drank from the fountains

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:20.258
There's more than one answer
to these questions

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.467
Pointing me in a crooked line

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.803
- And the less I seek my source
- Less I seek

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.599
- For some definitive
- My source

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:31.269
The closer I am to fine

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:32.475
Yeah

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:36.107
The closer I am to fine

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.905
Yeah

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.747
I'm gonna get some air.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.883
I'm gonna be right back.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:09.179
How you feeling?

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.476
Better, thank you.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.450
Thank you for being here.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:32.999
How's the job search going?

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.166
Okay.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:37.210
I'm waiting for a second interview at Amazon.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.668
Really? That's amazing.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:43.550
No, not... Not that Amazon. I...

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.802
The... The club in Bristol.
They need bartenders.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.595
Yeah.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.803
- Do you bartend?
- No.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.645
No. Never.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.395
You know, Dad wants to hire you back.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.855
What?

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.735
No.

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.658
Yeah, what he said.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.987
Dad wants me to work for him again?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.242
Nope, not for him.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.370
Dad wants you to run the company with him.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.081
He's just too proud to ask.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.583
I mean, he won't be able
to pay you right away,

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.627
not until the company
gets back on its feet, but...

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:21.129
The job's yours.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.634
He can't pay me?

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.475
You're living in his house rent-free, Ron.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.844
Yeah, well...

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.851
That's his duty as one of the people who
brought me into this world without asking.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:36.190
That's one way to look at it.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.356
What do you say?

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.023
I'll think about it.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:44.903
Good.

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.235
Yeah.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.622
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.120
Ron wants his job back.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.666
What?

01:05:58.746 --> 01:05:59.918
Yeah.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.960
Said he'll work for no pay
till the company's back on its feet.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.632
He said he'd work for no pay?

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:11.059
Yep. That's exactly what he said.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.523
Guys.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.812
Well, the operation was a success.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.733
- Man.
- Okay...

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.652
We're moving her into intensive care,

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.985
just to keep an eye on her,
see how she progresses.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.069
You can visit her once she's settled.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.155
Well, I just...
I can't thank you enough, Doctor.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.908
You don't know how much I appreciate this.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.748
Well, Mr. Hollar, you're very welcome.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.510
I'll stay here with your mom.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.638
Why don't you two boys go home
and get some rest?

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.554
- I want to stay.
- No.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.684
No, you... You got to take Rebecca home.

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.142
She needs to spend the night in a real bed.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.769
- You sure? I...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.944
Go.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.947
Ron. You too.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.659
It's going to be fine.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:29.800
They're good boys.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.717
She's going to be okay, right?

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.138
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.970
- Better than ever.
- Yeah.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:41.732
Tell Dad I'll take the job.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.364
Come on, girls.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.532
Bye, Mom!

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:56.205
- Bye.
- Hey, guys.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:00.994
Thank you.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.711
Hey, wait for me!

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.073
Don?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.988
Hey, Chief.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.448
How you doing?

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:43.790
Did... Did they get it?

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.582
Yeah, they got it.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.915
Tumor's gone.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.385
Good.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.180
You did great, Chief.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.564
Sally?

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.563
Sally.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.148
Sally!

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:10.692
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.024
I need everyone in here now.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.983
Stephanie, check her pulse for me.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.819
- Sally! Sally! Sally?
- Got to get ready for bagging.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:18.741
- Kristin, lower the bed and get ready for CPR.
- Page Dr. Fong stat.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.947
I need a crash cart now.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:20.993
- Someone's called a code.
- What's going on?

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.200
Sir, we need you to step out of the room.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.497
No, I thought the surgery
was a success, they...

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.791
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I don't understand.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.417
Mrs. Hollar, can you hear me?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.796
Do we have a pulse?

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:34.129
- Med code.
- Start bagging.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.010
Mrs. Hollar, can you hear me?

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.373
Hello.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.080
Hey, Dad.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.141
What?

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:19.943
Hey, Mr. Hollar.

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.366
I'm... I'm really, terribly sorry about...

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.868
What do you want?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:30.712
Sally asked me to give you this,
in case she ever, you know...

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.636
She was a wonderful woman.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.390
Thanks.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:10.743
If you're reading this letter,
then I guess I didn't make it.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.500
I'm sorry I can't be there
to help you through this, Donald,

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.127
but you're going to be okay.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.551
Buck up.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.463
You gave me a great life.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.842
I love you so much.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:26.926
Sally.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.974
I love you, too.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.306
I can't.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:33.938
Chief, I can't, I can't.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.061
I can't.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:00.793
What?

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.423
Sorry.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:06.098
She asked me to wait a couple minutes
and then give you this one.

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:16.977
Stop crying.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.897
You've got a funeral to plan.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.654
Don't forget I like orchids.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.489
Everything okay?

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.288
Thanks for this.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:02.814
Now, as far as caskets go...

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:04.365
Well, we want the best one you have.

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.780
Dad, that's a lot of money.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.323
I don't care.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.656
- Well, how are we going to pay for it?
- You're just gonna pay for it.

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:14.453
Actually, all the expenses
have already been taken care of.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.956
What? By who?

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.208
An anonymous party.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.164
I don't understand.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.884
Yeah, we don't know any anonymous parties.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.087
Is that it?

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.922
- That's it.
- Thank you.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.382
You're welcome.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.983
You ready to go?

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:44.735
No, I think I'm just
going to be here for a minute.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.071
Okay.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.063
Did you just pay for my mom's funeral?

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.689
I wanted to do something and you said
you were strapped for cash, so...

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:28.235
Don't tell your dad, okay?

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:31.364
It's incredibly generous,

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.367
but, unfortunately, we can't accept it.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.576
Why not?

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.784
I just can't, Becca.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:39.664
This isn't how it was supposed to be, and...

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.041
John...

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:44.297
Please accept it?

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.880
This is not an issue, okay?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.131
I have money now.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.179
You'll have money later.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.429
We're family. It doesn't make a difference.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.146
Marry me?

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.188
What?

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.907
Marry me right now.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.239
Now?

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.618
Are you sure this is the best time?

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:20.125
Well, they say
"for better or for worse," right?

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.046
I can't think of a worse time than now.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.016
Take me someplace she loved.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.525
Do you, John, take Rebecca
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:53.655
I do.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.784
And, Rebecca,
do you take John to be your husband?

01:16:58.864 --> 01:16:59.865
I do.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.605
All right, that'll do.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:27.980
By the power vested in me, surrounded
by nature and under the eyes of God,

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.439
I now pronounce you both husband and wife.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:33.616
Kiss your bride.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:18:01.052
Thank you for being here
to celebrate my mother.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:06.266
She once told me,

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:10.945
when I was going through a time
in my life where I was very lost...

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.778
She said,

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:19.829
"You won't know until you get there
that you're okay."

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.081
And...

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.329
She was right.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.248
My mother was strong.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:35.804
She was really strong
and she was strong for all of us.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.717
I know there's a number of people
here today that are wondering

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:41.011
what we're going to do without her.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:42.092
But...

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:43.428
John, your wife's going into labor.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:45.349
No, I'm not. No, no, no.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.475
- No, I'm fine.
- You okay?

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.601
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:48.853
- You okay?
- No, no, no. No.

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:50.480
- Okay.
- Sure, all right.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.525
I'm so sorry.

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.656
I think I might be fine. I think.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.571
No, no. You're not.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:18:59.822
Okay, we're going to the hospital.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.245
Come on. Come on.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.537
Good-bye, Mom.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.167
We love you.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.456
Come on.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.502
Okay.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:19.005
- Good? You in?
- All right.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.340
- Okay.
- All right.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:21.548
You're doing great.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:22.758
You're doing great...

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.889
Doing good.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.221
Everybody got your seat belts on?

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:27.429
Go. Go.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.309
Oh, shit!

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.938
Never got that fixed.

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.270
Come on, Ron.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.105
Yeah, we're going to
get in here 'cause this is...

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.526
- Come on, here we go.
- We're good.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.944
Okay, all right.

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.368
We're all blocked in...

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.952
This feels like a bad way
to bring kids into the world.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.454
No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:49.622
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.040
Okay, here we go.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.246
- Hang on.
- Go.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.706
Ron, Ron, Ron.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.400
I'm coming! Emergency!

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:19.731
John?

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.609
- John!
- We're coming. I'm coming.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.615
- We're coming. Here we go.
- John.

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:26.197
Come on, come on, this way.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:29.575
Excuse me.

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:32.331
We're having a baby. Where do we go?

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:33.457
That's the next building.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.164
- What?
- Go down the hall, to the right.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:36.335
Down the hall, to the right.

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:37.461
- Okay.
- Wait!

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:38.837
You can't all go.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:40.760
What? What do you mean?

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.888
- I can...
- John!

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:44.969
Sweet John.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.596
All right, we're gonna go get a room, Dad.

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:49.094
Sweetie...

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.055
Thank you.

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.354
All right!

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:56.435
Yeah.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.565
John, I'm scared!

01:20:58.645 --> 01:20:59.817
Me, too.

01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:02.611
- You're not supposed to tell me that.
- No, it's going to be okay.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.692
You're going to do great.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:04.948
Here we go!

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:11.200
You think they're going to be okay?

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.284
Yeah.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:14.999
They're going to be just fine.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.629
What about us?

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:42.439
Mrs. Hollar?

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.740
- Yes.
- Right this way.
