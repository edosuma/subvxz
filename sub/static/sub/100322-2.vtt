00:05.850 --> 00:08.669
So who is Manfred?

00:08.670 --> 00:12.809
It's a chatroom for people who
struggle with suicidal thoughts.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.089
- How many people are on here?
- It's Rowan Cole.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.829
"I want to knock "myself out
and let my aircraft take me."

00:18.830 --> 00:21.469
- "Do it. Stop hurting."
- "With you."

00:21.470 --> 00:23.739
This is incitement to suicide.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.740
"There was an innocent child.
My doing

00:26.090 --> 00:27.960
You don't know
the half of what I've done.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.799
<i>So who was on it?</i>

00:31.800 --> 00:34.930
<i>Ezra Heller. 11-years-old.
Jonathan Kraft.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:37.389
Ex US Ambassador Jonathan Kraft?

00:37.390 --> 00:39.679
Matt, can you give me a call?

00:39.680 --> 00:41.459
Jonathan didn't make it.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.769
<i>A couple of pilots.</i>

00:42.770 --> 00:47.180
<i>The captain, Alex Vitarnen,
and Rowan Cole, a non-flying pilot.</i>

00:47.490 --> 00:50.539
Rowan Cole was seeing
a psychotherapist.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.409
Did he express suicidal thoughts?

00:53.410 --> 00:54.869
Not to me.

00:54.870 --> 00:56.289
<i>Peter Sachs.</i>

00:56.290 --> 00:57.939
<i>Shot himself through
the roof of his mouth.</i>

00:57.940 --> 01:00.239
Desperate men looking
for someone to trust

01:00.240 --> 01:02.600
<i>and he's preying on them.</i>

01:04.410 --> 01:07.259
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.560
Matt?

SILENT WITNESS
Season 23 - Episode 02

01:41.790 --> 01:44.740
"Deadhead"
Part 1 of 2

01:55.250 --> 01:57.609
The last moments that
plane was in the air,

01:57.610 --> 02:00.669
it was trying to pull up. Which is
why the tail hit the ground first?

02:00.670 --> 02:02.309
- Right.
- So, what?

02:02.310 --> 02:06.989
Did Alex come around
and find the plane in a steep dive?

02:06.990 --> 02:09.679
He was fighting to save
the people on board?

02:09.680 --> 02:11.809
Nikki,
you with me here or what?

02:11.810 --> 02:14.200
- Can I catch you up?
- Yeah.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.529
<i>Hi, this is Matt.</i>

02:24.530 --> 02:26.970
<i>I can't get to the phone.
Please leave a message.</i>

02:35.450 --> 02:37.689
<i>Well, everything's been
catalogued and laid out,</i>

02:37.690 --> 02:39.449
<i>so it's up to you what you
want to see first.</i>

02:39.450 --> 02:41.649
<i>- Great.</i>
- Sorry.

02:41.650 --> 02:45.669
So what does the flight data
recorder tell us?

02:45.670 --> 02:49.009
The FDR will give us stuff like the
heading direction of the aircraft,

02:49.010 --> 02:52.089
airspeed, altitude, et cetera.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.159
But it's not going to tell us
who was flying the plane?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.109
No. It won't tell us whose
hands were on the controls,

02:57.110 --> 02:59.269
just that the inputs were
being made.

02:59.270 --> 03:00.899
The plane was in a dive,

03:00.900 --> 03:02.709
then it levelled out,
then dived again.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.199
Am I right in thinking that the nose
came up just before impact?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.109
- Yes.
- And that wasn't the autopilot?

03:07.110 --> 03:08.860
No, it wasn't engaged.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.950
OK. So the two
steering yokes.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.899
They move in unison.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.859
Though the FDR can record
that the plane

03:15.860 --> 03:17.419
was being moved or
put into a dive,

03:17.420 --> 03:20.229
it won't be able to tell you
which yoke, which pilot, did that.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.689
But you got fingerprints
from both, right?

03:22.690 --> 03:25.789
Yes. Extensive patterning on Alex's.
Less so Cole's.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.699
Cole shouldn't be flying at all. He
wasn't rostered to fly this trip.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.899
He was just a pilot
hitching a lift home.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.120
- Can we see the steering yokes?
- Sure.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.960
- Which one had Cole's prints on it?
- This one.

03:39.210 --> 03:40.519
We're looking for blood.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.250
Cole had lacerations
on the palms of his hands.

03:49.570 --> 03:51.369
Yeah, there's handprints.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.559
Where most of the blood is,

03:53.560 --> 03:56.780
it's where his hands would've
been if he was flying the plane.

03:59.290 --> 04:01.639
See here,
these tears on his palms?

04:01.640 --> 04:02.949
Right.

04:02.950 --> 04:07.359
X-rays confirm fractures
of the thumbs and both wrists.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.239
It's more than straightforward
impact damage though.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.899
The way they're broken suggests
specifically that his thumb

04:12.900 --> 04:15.959
and fingers were firmly closed
around something on impact.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.879
Holding on to something
like a steering column?

04:18.880 --> 04:20.289
More than holding on.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.950
Fighting with it.
Pulling back hard.

04:23.670 --> 04:26.219
Like maybe when you put
the plane into a hard dive

04:26.220 --> 04:28.429
then changed your mind
at the last minute?

04:28.430 --> 04:31.830
So, are we saying he was
definitely flying the plane?

04:32.650 --> 04:34.959
I can't confirm that,
absolutely, but...

04:34.960 --> 04:37.870
but his injuries may be
consistent with it, yes.

04:43.410 --> 04:47.459
<i>The aircraft's descending</i>
at six thousand feet per minute.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.339
But at fifteen hundred feet,

04:49.340 --> 04:51.439
whoever is flying
the plane panics

04:51.440 --> 04:53.129
and tries to pull up.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.559
But too late to save the aircraft.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.979
And 15 seconds later,

04:56.980 --> 04:59.969
the tail and rear fuselage
hit the ground.

04:59.970 --> 05:03.629
Immediately after that the rest
of the aircraft hits the ground.

05:03.630 --> 05:07.469
The cockpit
and central section break away

05:07.470 --> 05:10.179
and the fuel tanks
in the wings ignite

05:10.180 --> 05:13.379
and the passenger cabin
bursts in to flames.

05:13.380 --> 05:17.290
This is all borne out
by the Flight Data Recorder.

05:18.170 --> 05:20.589
So, Rowan Cole.

05:20.590 --> 05:23.609
What were his movements
before boarding the flight?

05:23.610 --> 05:24.919
- Did you manage to...
- Yes.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.219
He flew out of the UK the day
before to pilot an empty aircraft

05:28.220 --> 05:30.809
from Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam,
to Dubai.

05:30.810 --> 05:33.939
But the job was cancelled.
The client changed their mind.

05:33.940 --> 05:38.230
So he hitches a ride back to the
UK on Juno 537.

05:38.850 --> 05:41.159
When did he know he'd
be on that flight, then?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.109
Just a couple of hours beforehand.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.669
It couldn't have been his intention
to target Kraft then, could it?

05:45.670 --> 05:48.000
So it's pilot suicide?

05:48.570 --> 05:50.169
A few people on the chatroom

05:50.170 --> 05:53.039
are using a Virtual
Private Network.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.499
Which is what, some sort of device
to hide your identity?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.169
Normally your internet
service provider

05:59.170 --> 06:00.879
gives you an IP address

06:00.880 --> 06:04.109
that we can trace you to
or ID you that way.

06:04.110 --> 06:08.179
You paid for it, so you'll have
given them your info or whatever.

06:08.180 --> 06:10.919
- Yeah.
- If you're using a VPN,

06:10.920 --> 06:15.459
it takes you to a remote server,
usually in another country.

06:15.460 --> 06:19.699
- What, and that's it?
- Yeah. In effect, that's who you are.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.109
The server.
No name, no address,

06:22.110 --> 06:23.959
no payment details, nothing.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.339
This guy, Manfred.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.899
He's using multiple VPNs.

06:28.900 --> 06:32.169
If I trace him to a server, well,
there's another and another and another.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.449
- So he's untraceable?
- Pretty much.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.910
But here's the interesting thing.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.459
I traced this user to his ISP.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.339
The police got a warrant

06:43.340 --> 06:47.219
for LoneRangerUK78's
payment details.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.549
He's your guy.

06:49.550 --> 06:51.490
Peter Sachs.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.829
We've got more from
Cole's smartphone.

06:58.830 --> 07:01.729
He's been communicating
privately with Manfred

07:01.730 --> 07:03.449
on a secure messaging app.

07:03.450 --> 07:06.039
The messages were encrypted, but...

07:06.040 --> 07:08.549
This is how it looks
after we got access.

07:08.550 --> 07:12.549
These are from a user
called Ridley33.

07:12.550 --> 07:15.369
- Ridley meaning Rowan Cole?
- Yes.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.219
He's at Schiphol in Holland

07:17.220 --> 07:19.699
panicking because his
flight's been cancelled.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.450
The Dubai flight presumably?

07:22.770 --> 07:24.459
"Schiphol cancelled,

07:24.460 --> 07:28.789
"back to UK with one crew,
three cabin, and me, deadhead."

07:28.790 --> 07:31.459
"Need to take my life so bad now."

07:31.460 --> 07:33.619
He's going to be on a flight
with other people,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.489
but he still wants to bring it down.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.069
So he's got a dilemma.

07:38.070 --> 07:41.559
He wants to die now, but that
involves killing other people.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.230
Manfred tells him to do it anyway.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.129
Manfred killed them.

07:51.130 --> 07:54.979
By incitement.
By inciting Rowan Cole.

07:54.980 --> 07:58.029
So who else is he
private messaging?

07:58.030 --> 08:01.449
All the people on that chatroom
are potentially at risk.

08:01.450 --> 08:04.319
Ezra Heller, the boy on the plane.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.090
He's conscious.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.000
- Help!
- Dad!

09:12.900 --> 09:14.509
J0rdy6699: "I feel so bad"

09:14.510 --> 09:17.319
Lew1s_R8: "No point.
What's done is done."

09:17.320 --> 09:18.629
J0rdy6699: "I don'tknow"

09:18.630 --> 09:21.089
J0rdy6699: "Decided.
Whatever comes after it"

09:21.090 --> 09:22.399
J0rdy6699: "=Better"

09:22.400 --> 09:24.259
J0rdy6699: "What I've done.
Shameful."

09:24.260 --> 09:25.569
J0rdy6699: "Soon?"

09:25.570 --> 09:27.020
J0rdy6699: "I'm ready."

09:44.980 --> 09:47.430
Lew1s_R8: "Are you sure?
Please be sur.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.740
J0rdy6699: "Yes"

10:05.850 --> 10:07.150
<i>Ezra.</i>

10:07.930 --> 10:11.300
Was this your seat?
Here by the window?

10:13.330 --> 10:15.769
But you didn't stay
in your seat, did you?

10:15.770 --> 10:19.169
The other guy took me.

10:19.170 --> 10:22.819
- To the flight deck?
- To meet the captain.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.629
And then you went back to your seat?

10:24.630 --> 10:26.770
And while you were
on the flight deck,

10:27.130 --> 10:30.370
did you see him do anything,
the other pilot?

10:31.330 --> 10:34.550
- That's enough now.
- He texted.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.289
Just a minute, please.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.129
He texted?

10:39.130 --> 10:43.080
And you saw that clearly,
did you, Ezra?

10:46.850 --> 10:49.069
Did you see who he texted?

10:49.070 --> 10:50.379
Did they have a name?

10:50.380 --> 10:54.340
- No.
- No. OK.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.430
Well done, Ezra.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.060
Thanks for that.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.160
How's he doing?

11:24.970 --> 11:26.490
It's watch and wait.

11:28.290 --> 11:29.650
Right.

11:33.010 --> 11:34.710
It's so tough for you.

11:36.450 --> 11:38.750
Telling him
about his mum as well.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.030
I'm sorry, I didn't...

11:47.130 --> 11:48.930
He doesn't know.

11:51.530 --> 11:53.530
I can't tell him.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.129
No, text.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.849
Yeah, definitely text.

12:06.850 --> 12:09.389
Here's Jack. <i>I'm just going
to put us on speaker phone.</i>

12:09.390 --> 12:11.849
I've not started to try
and recover texts, yet.

12:11.850 --> 12:13.539
Everything was deleted.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.449
Just a sec.

12:15.450 --> 12:16.959
<i>Hi, Clarissa.</i>

12:16.960 --> 12:19.949
<i>There's a list of numbers
Rowan Cole</i> called and texted,

12:19.950 --> 12:22.309
but no content yet,
<i>not from the texts.</i>

12:22.310 --> 12:25.559
It's in a file called RCTXT.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.860
Yep, I've found it.

12:28.170 --> 12:32.919
Well, the last text he sent
was at 05:34ªm

12:32.920 --> 12:34.869
<i>to 077</i>

12:34.870 --> 12:38.679
00900475.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.720
So, 12 minutes or so
before <i>the plane went down.</i>

12:42.160 --> 12:44.179
We're just looking that number up.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.370
The last person he contacted
was a John Stanley.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.769
His psychotherapist.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.830
<i>OK.
I'll get a warrant.</i>

12:57.010 --> 13:00.930
So, when we spoke previously, why
did you withhold that information?

13:02.770 --> 13:05.959
Why didn't you tell me that
he'd texted you from the aircraft?

13:05.960 --> 13:08.989
You must have realised it was
relevant to our enquiries?

13:08.990 --> 13:11.340
How is it relevant
who he texted?

13:14.810 --> 13:17.600
I didn't tell you about it because
I didn't think it was important.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.580
If it is.

13:20.490 --> 13:23.230
And I didn't reply to it,
so it wasn't a conversation.

13:24.410 --> 13:27.569
Rowan was searching
for direction in his life.

13:27.570 --> 13:30.579
Answers to things that had
happened to him in the past.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.780
Childhood events he'd not been
able to come to terms with.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.390
<i>He'd never been taught
how to love freely.</i>

13:40.650 --> 13:43.050
<i>His parents were damaged people.</i>

13:48.930 --> 13:51.800
<i>And he couldn't accept
that he was capable of being loved.</i>

13:53.970 --> 13:56.000
<i>Or that he could love in return.</i>

13:57.010 --> 14:00.430
He didn't trust anyone.
Me included.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.309
And progress was...

14:04.310 --> 14:06.669
limited,
at best.

14:06.670 --> 14:10.409
I don't remember asking
for an analysis of his psyche.

14:10.410 --> 14:12.770
- I'm sorry?
- That's because I didn't.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.749
Why did he text you?

14:16.750 --> 14:19.009
To thank me for our work together

14:19.010 --> 14:21.489
and to tell me he wouldn't
be around for a while.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.160
- That all?
- Yes.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.589
So why delete it
from your phone?

14:25.590 --> 14:28.669
I do that regularly.
I delete old texts.

14:28.670 --> 14:30.409
See,
I don't get why

14:30.410 --> 14:32.069
he would text you

14:32.070 --> 14:33.379
at that moment

14:33.380 --> 14:35.939
just before the plane came
down to tell you that?

14:35.940 --> 14:37.749
- Neither do I.
- What was so important?

14:37.750 --> 14:39.809
I didn't even know
he was on a plane.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.769
I didn't realise that at the time.

14:41.770 --> 14:45.109
But you did after it came down?
You must have known then.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.609
His name was among the dead.
It was across the press.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.959
And yet when we spoke,
you made a decision

14:49.960 --> 14:52.289
- not to mention something that you...
- I was shocked.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.180
- You were shocked?
- Yes.

14:56.170 --> 14:57.970
And ashamed.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.530
With hindsight,
I...

15:01.870 --> 15:04.099
..think perhaps he
got in touch with me

15:04.100 --> 15:05.600
because he wanted my help.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.230
And what did I do?

15:08.900 --> 15:10.200
Nothing.

15:11.530 --> 15:13.730
I didn't pick up on his desperation.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.209
My fault.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.620
Absolutely.
The whole thing. My fault.

15:22.330 --> 15:26.210
So you told me nothing
because you felt guilty?

15:50.210 --> 15:53.309
- Howdy.
- Hello. I've sent you a pic.

15:53.310 --> 15:54.989
It's a wee bit of foil that pops out

15:54.990 --> 15:57.389
<i>when you push a tablet through
the blister pack, you know.</i>

15:57.390 --> 15:59.050
Yeah, I've got it.

16:08.490 --> 16:13.069
You'll be delighted to know
it's from an Alprazolam pack.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.729
Fantastic.

16:14.730 --> 16:17.130
You think it's a good thing
he killed himself?

16:18.150 --> 16:21.600
Are you being rhetorical or are you
actually asking me a question now?

16:23.370 --> 16:26.009
People struggle.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.650
And people recover.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.789
You prey on them

16:31.790 --> 16:33.690
- when they're at their most vulnerable.
- No!

16:35.370 --> 16:39.780
My practice is founded on the
principles of self-determination.

16:41.330 --> 16:45.719
I try and help people
to take responsibility

16:45.720 --> 16:47.950
for who they are and how they act.

16:49.270 --> 16:50.570
Who...

16:51.490 --> 16:53.380
..is Manfred?

17:08.050 --> 17:11.460
Are you Manfred, Mr Stanley?

17:15.970 --> 17:20.170
Hiya. Jack has found evidence of
Alprazolam at Stanley's apartment.

17:20.690 --> 17:23.569
<i>But he was prescribed it
some years ago</i> for insomnia.

17:23.569 --> 17:26.019
<i>- So he has it legitimately?</i>
- Yeah.

17:26.020 --> 17:28.849
And the prescription hasn't
been renewed in over five years.

17:28.850 --> 17:30.649
It's a fairly common drug.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.819
<i>And Jack hasn't found anything else.</i>

17:32.820 --> 17:35.089
<i>There's nothing to link Stanley
to Peter Sachs</i>

17:35.090 --> 17:37.209
<i>and there's no</i> evidence
on his computer

17:37.210 --> 17:38.819
that he was on that chatroom.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.729
Jack's going to take away
his computer

17:40.730 --> 17:43.339
- and look more deeply, but...
<i>- It's not enough.</i>

17:43.340 --> 17:46.259
We'll have to let him go.
We'll keep an eye on him.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.560
Thanks.

17:56.610 --> 17:58.709
<i>OK,
that's all booked in for you.</i>

17:58.710 --> 18:00.289
<i>Would you like
to add breakfast?</i>

18:00.290 --> 18:02.689
I'll just take the room
for the night if that's all right.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.999
- No problem.
- Thanks.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.309
And I'll pay cash.

18:05.310 --> 18:07.400
<i>This is Kyle.
Leave a message.</i>

18:11.210 --> 18:12.510
Ella?

18:13.830 --> 18:15.130
Ella?

19:00.690 --> 19:01.990
Help!

19:03.250 --> 19:04.570
Dad!

19:19.130 --> 19:21.430
J0rdy6699: "Pills?"

19:30.740 --> 19:32.940
Lew1s_R8: "J0rdy6699,
can I join you?

19:45.550 --> 19:46.850
J0rdy6699: "Yes"

19:50.800 --> 19:52.350
Lew1s_R8: "Do it together?"

19:56.160 --> 19:57.569
Manfred068: "Kind offerr."

19:57.570 --> 19:59.169
Jack.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.840
Manfred's online.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.890
What have we got?

20:08.550 --> 20:09.910
Look.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.370
J0rdy6699: "So can you get me them?"

20:20.340 --> 20:21.640
Mandfred068: "On my way"

20:27.130 --> 20:29.589
- DI Rosen.
- It's Clarissa Mullery.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.209
I don't know if your people
have flagged it,

20:31.210 --> 20:33.189
but <i>there's been
activity online.</i>

20:33.190 --> 20:34.560
<i>Manfred's on the move.</i>

20:34.970 --> 20:37.350
Thanks.
Yeah, we've got him.

20:38.970 --> 20:42.870
<i>All units from DI Rosen,</i>
suspect is on move.

20:45.130 --> 20:48.000
turning right into Thornton Rise.

20:48.590 --> 20:51.570
Suspect is turning right
into Cerrington Road.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.589
He's messaging again.
<i>Live.</i>

20:57.590 --> 21:00.180
What's he doing? Typing and driving?

21:00.930 --> 21:02.849
This guy's got serious pretensions.

21:02.850 --> 21:04.579
Another message from Manfred.

21:04.580 --> 21:08.099
"Mohammed's coming to the mountain.
<i>Stay calm.</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:10.989
<i>"Won't be long now.
Will leave it for you."</i>

21:10.990 --> 21:12.919
- How's he doing that?
- Voice command.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.610
- Auto-dictation.
- He must have his phone on him.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.569
<i>He must be messaging
that guy right now.</i>

21:19.570 --> 21:20.870
<i>Let's grab him.</i>

21:25.210 --> 21:26.969
All units.
He's turning.

21:26.970 --> 21:29.570
He's going back the way we came.
Up Thornton Rise.

21:31.890 --> 21:34.449
<i>All units, suspect is on
Thornton Rise.</i>

21:34.450 --> 21:35.950
He's heading home.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.200
Get out of the car.

21:45.630 --> 21:48.230
- What did I do?
- Stand over there.

21:49.130 --> 21:50.730
Raise your arms.

22:00.290 --> 22:02.480
Where were you going, Mr Stanley?

22:02.990 --> 22:06.209
I was heading into town until
I realised I'd forgotten my phone.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.929
Just stay there.

22:07.930 --> 22:10.300
- Anything?
- Car's clean, Guv.

22:11.170 --> 22:13.180
It's not him, is it?

22:15.710 --> 22:17.550
He's not our man.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.110
Kyle?

22:39.850 --> 22:41.150
She's OK.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.450
Where are you?

22:45.490 --> 22:46.790
I'm sorry.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.709
I shouldn't have said what I did.

22:49.710 --> 22:52.720
<i>If you've taken her
to punish me...</i>

22:53.150 --> 22:54.790
No, no.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.550
That plane.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.930
Something I said online
made it happen.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.720
<i>So...</i>
I've got somebody helping me.

23:08.570 --> 23:10.060
It's going to be OK.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.440
<i>We're going to be with Tommy soon.</i>

23:15.530 --> 23:16.830
I love you.

23:25.490 --> 23:26.790
Kyle?!

23:32.370 --> 23:34.779
<i>Emergency services operator.
Which service do you require?</i>

23:34.780 --> 23:36.309
Police, please.

23:36.310 --> 23:37.700
<i>Connecting you now.</i>

23:40.700 --> 23:42.269
- Hi.
- Hello, sir.

23:42.270 --> 23:44.829
I think someone may have
left something for me here.

23:44.830 --> 23:46.369
Room 1020.

23:46.370 --> 23:47.889
OK.
One second.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.930
- There you go.
- Thanks.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.969
<i>What's your mum going to say?</i>

23:55.970 --> 23:57.989
<i>Do you think you could do it,
Holly?</i>

23:57.990 --> 23:59.970
<i>I think you can.</i>

24:16.650 --> 24:18.570
- Help!
- Dad!

24:29.170 --> 24:31.960
Did Kyle talk about
wanting to end his life?

24:34.330 --> 24:36.880
We both did at the beginning.

24:37.730 --> 24:39.030
At the beginning?

24:40.810 --> 24:42.569
Yeah.

24:42.570 --> 24:44.250
September last year.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.510
Can you tell me about that?

24:51.010 --> 24:54.660
We had a son as well as a daughter.

24:56.030 --> 24:57.609
Tommy.

24:57.610 --> 24:59.889
He was five years old.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.729
Kyle took them out for the day.

25:02.730 --> 25:04.330
I was working.

25:07.930 --> 25:09.960
He was playing with Ella...

25:11.210 --> 25:12.880
..and there was a lake.

25:15.690 --> 25:17.310
When he realised...

25:19.290 --> 25:21.730
..Tommy was face down in the water.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.400
I'm so sorry, Kate.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.390
And Kyle blames himself?

25:33.050 --> 25:34.530
It was him.

25:35.690 --> 25:36.990
It was his fault.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.670
Sorry.

26:01.010 --> 26:02.460
What's happening, Matt?

26:04.050 --> 26:05.650
I don't know.
I...

26:06.250 --> 26:08.779
..I was about to board my flight,
and I thought,

26:08.780 --> 26:12.110
"What are you doing?
"Why am I going?"

26:13.970 --> 26:16.920
Maybe it's all this stuff
with Jonathan's death has...

26:20.170 --> 26:21.740
..reminded me of...

26:23.160 --> 26:25.179
of losing my brother Dan.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.510
I mean...

26:28.290 --> 26:32.020
..was there something I could
have done to save them?

26:32.330 --> 26:36.060
There is nothing in the world you
could have done to save Jonathan.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.190
Dan, then.

26:42.410 --> 26:45.609
I mean, maybe if I was there,

26:45.610 --> 26:49.200
I would have made sure that
he didn't swim out so far or...

26:50.930 --> 26:53.050
..or something.
I don't...

26:57.170 --> 26:59.249
Look, I understand
that's how it might feel,

26:59.250 --> 27:03.350
but you can't spend a lifetime
blaming yourself.

27:04.130 --> 27:09.030
Yeah, but you don't understand
how I feel, do you?

27:09.610 --> 27:11.820
Because it didn't happen to you.

27:37.770 --> 27:39.600
I don't know what to say.

27:43.050 --> 27:45.650
I don't know what to do
to make it better.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.120
I know people you can talk to.

28:07.610 --> 28:09.759
<i>This is what we know so far.</i>

28:09.760 --> 28:11.769
Her husband called her.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.900
She thinks he's suicidal.

28:14.930 --> 28:18.049
She mentioned Juno 357
to the attending officers,

28:18.050 --> 28:20.330
so obviously they flagged
that up to us.

28:20.970 --> 28:23.509
- Mentioned what?
- That Kyle was responsible,

28:23.510 --> 28:26.660
that he posted something online
that encouraged the pilot.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.289
I was told he'd left
his smartphone behind.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.860
Yeah.
That's it.

28:33.050 --> 28:36.130
He...
probably didn't want it traced.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.609
Wiped his browser history.

28:40.610 --> 28:42.489
There's an app here.

28:42.490 --> 28:45.940
It's the same app Manfred
uses for personal messaging.

28:46.650 --> 28:48.930
- I'm going to crack on with this.
- Yeah, I'II...

28:52.890 --> 28:54.250
Sorry about that.

28:57.410 --> 29:00.370
Does the name Manfred
mean anything to you?

29:02.410 --> 29:06.090
Or Jordy...or Lewis?

29:06.730 --> 29:08.280
Does that sound familiar?

29:10.250 --> 29:12.010
You're doing great, Kate.

29:13.370 --> 29:16.450
What do you think
he's thinking right now?

29:17.770 --> 29:19.460
In Kyle's head...

29:20.970 --> 29:23.060
..Tommy's in another place.

29:24.010 --> 29:27.289
He said before,
when it was bad,

29:27.290 --> 29:29.810
he wanted us all to be
there together.

29:31.330 --> 29:34.489
It wasn't like a rational thing.

29:34.490 --> 29:36.530
It was a reaction.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.610
I wouldn't, obviously,

29:41.850 --> 29:43.150
but Ella...

29:43.530 --> 29:45.839
So Kyle's logic

29:45.840 --> 29:47.649
is that he wants to...

29:47.650 --> 29:51.709
reunite himself and
Ella with Tommy?

29:51.710 --> 29:53.930
Is that what you're saying?

29:58.770 --> 30:00.079
OK.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.730
Kate, be back in a minute,
all right?

30:07.530 --> 30:09.549
He's been back online.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.529
Direct messages.

30:11.530 --> 30:14.049
Calls himself Jordy6699.

30:14.050 --> 30:15.649
Messaging Manfred?

30:15.650 --> 30:18.129
Jordy's expecting something
to be delivered,

30:18.130 --> 30:21.049
and Manfred says he'll leave
it for him somewhere.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.350
Pills.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.320
He asked them for them
in the chatroom.

30:26.330 --> 30:28.590
So why's he got his daughter
with him?

33:10.550 --> 33:12.859
Lew1s_R8: "J0rdy6699,
going to ask again,"

33:12.860 --> 33:14.719
Lew1s_R8:
"Can we do it together?"

33:14.720 --> 33:16.220
Lew1s_R8: "Real offer."

33:24.500 --> 33:25.800
J0rdy6699: "Yes."

33:27.110 --> 33:29.560
Lew1s_R8:
"Meet somewhere special for you?"

33:29.920 --> 33:31.220
J0rdy6699: "Yes."

33:42.530 --> 33:44.900
Got you, J0rdy6699.

34:21.570 --> 34:23.688
Kyle Cunningham's room, please.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.560
OK, thanks.
With me.

34:27.730 --> 34:29.139
Go on.
Check the room.

34:39.330 --> 34:41.340
We had fun, didn't we?

34:44.610 --> 34:46.320
You know I love you, right?

34:47.690 --> 34:49.330
I love you, too, Dad.

34:55.449 --> 34:57.360
All right.
Take your stuff.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.350
You've got to go home now.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.820
I said you got to go.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.429
We've got a match.

36:01.430 --> 36:03.649
Fingerprints on the box of tablets

36:03.650 --> 36:05.819
match an unidentified profile

36:05.820 --> 36:08.810
found at Peter Sachs' house.

36:10.150 --> 36:14.129
You didn't go to the scene,
the Peter Sachs scene, did you?

36:14.130 --> 36:15.950
- No. Shall we take a look?
- Yeah.

36:16.770 --> 36:18.070
Yeah.

36:23.370 --> 36:25.320
- This is where he shot himself?
- Yeah.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.629
So if someone was with him,

36:27.630 --> 36:30.119
they'd come in through
the main garage doors here.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.500
- This door into the house, maybe.
- OK.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.270
Where does this go?

36:53.450 --> 36:55.050
I've got blood here.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.990
These are from Peter Sachs' house.

37:03.010 --> 37:04.730
These are from the crash site.

37:05.650 --> 37:07.569
Same boot tread?

37:07.570 --> 37:08.970
Same boot tread.

37:09.930 --> 37:12.849
So possibly the same person
at both scenes.

37:12.850 --> 37:15.809
We've got someone with Peter Sachs
around the time he killed himself,

37:15.810 --> 37:18.259
we think, and the same person
visiting the crash site,

37:18.260 --> 37:19.769
visiting Rowan Cole.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.889
Are we saying we have
Manfred's fingerprints here?

37:21.890 --> 37:24.499
Yep, and likely his
footwear marks, too.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.809
We just don't have a name.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.809
I've got a lead on the gun, too.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.729
From the serial number
you recovered,

37:29.730 --> 37:31.440
it's registered to

37:31.810 --> 37:34.560
Gregory Anthony Bell.

37:34.970 --> 37:37.009
Died a couple of years ago.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.009
Ex-parachute regiment.

37:39.010 --> 37:40.769
Must be an old service weapon.

37:40.770 --> 37:43.369
- Probably kept it after
he was discharged.
- Or sold it.

37:43.370 --> 37:45.489
Somebody did after his death.

37:45.490 --> 37:47.329
Cause of death -

37:47.330 --> 37:48.630
suicide.

37:50.490 --> 37:52.030
Can I just...?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.050
He's got a son.

38:04.090 --> 38:06.020
POLICE! POLICE! POLICE!

38:06.410 --> 38:07.710
Police! Police!

38:08.970 --> 38:10.520
Hello?

38:44.410 --> 38:46.669
- Hello.
- I've unravelled the VPNs

38:46.670 --> 38:49.420
and traced Manfred and
Lew1s' IP addresses.

38:49.730 --> 38:51.159
They're the same.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.430
- They're the same?
- Yes.

38:54.550 --> 38:56.459
You mean they're the same person?

38:56.460 --> 39:00.249
<i>Yes. Lew1s_R8 is another
online ID for the same guy,</i>

39:00.250 --> 39:02.169
for James Bell.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.529
Son of Gregory Bell,
the gun owner.

39:04.530 --> 39:05.830
Right.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.780
<i>Be careful, Jack.</i>

39:13.330 --> 39:15.089
- Anything?
- Not yet, guv.

39:15.090 --> 39:16.390
Right.

39:17.890 --> 39:19.650
This looks interesting.

39:27.410 --> 39:30.609
- You want me to get the enforcer?
- Nah.

39:30.610 --> 39:32.010
Prefer a lighter touch.

39:45.170 --> 39:47.330
- OK.
- OK, let's see what we've got here.

40:10.570 --> 40:11.870
Trophies.

40:15.370 --> 40:18.150
Peter Sachs' wedding
ring maybe? Huh.

40:21.890 --> 40:23.489
A tie pin.

40:23.490 --> 40:24.799
Rowan Coles'?

40:24.800 --> 40:28.110
Maybe James Bell went out to the
site, took a trophy from Rowan Cole.

40:28.450 --> 40:30.049
Did he track the flight?

40:30.050 --> 40:31.669
Maybe he knew in advance

40:31.670 --> 40:34.340
roughly where Cole was going
to bring it down. One or the other.

40:35.090 --> 40:37.740
Juno Airlines.

40:43.810 --> 40:46.030
Damage likely from the crash.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.670
These were from James Bell's place.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.980
- Clean?
- Yeah.

41:40.090 --> 41:41.390
Blood.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.750
Lots of tiny spots.

41:45.410 --> 41:48.160
We need to send this off
for DNA profiling straight away.

42:07.210 --> 42:08.689
Lewis?

42:08.690 --> 42:09.990
Yeah.

42:11.370 --> 42:14.170
I hoped you'd say yes
to me being here with you.

42:18.370 --> 42:19.849
Come on.

42:19.850 --> 42:21.150
Let's go.

42:25.130 --> 42:26.800
It's hard to leave.

42:28.570 --> 42:30.620
Even when you really want to.

42:32.370 --> 42:33.770
That instinct.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.470
It's so strong.

42:43.730 --> 42:45.230
DI Rosen.

42:47.450 --> 42:48.750
Where?

42:50.530 --> 42:52.000
OK.

42:53.810 --> 42:56.540
ANPR's picked up
Kyle Cunningham's van.

42:57.050 --> 42:59.670
- Where?
- Heading west out of London on the A4.

43:01.930 --> 43:03.420
I told him to do it.

43:06.170 --> 43:07.630
It was my fault.

43:09.570 --> 43:12.600
I'm responsible for the death
of innocent people.

43:14.130 --> 43:15.700
The people on that plane.

43:16.770 --> 43:18.070
Tommy.

43:19.290 --> 43:21.880
I don't set out to harm people,
but it's like...

43:23.610 --> 43:25.850
..my presence, my energy, it's...

43:28.170 --> 43:29.910
Better not here.

43:33.730 --> 43:35.030
Yeah.

43:36.930 --> 43:38.430
Better not here.

43:41.370 --> 43:43.110
I feel the same.

44:02.970 --> 44:04.569
That's the last sighting of him?

44:04.570 --> 44:06.059
- Yeah.
- So where's he going?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.289
What did Jim Bell
say online to Kyle -

44:08.290 --> 44:10.249
you know, about where to meet?

44:10.250 --> 44:12.609
"Somewhere special for you."

44:12.610 --> 44:14.089
His son drowned.

44:14.090 --> 44:15.960
Where?
Where did that happen?

45:27.610 --> 45:30.109
We never talk about Tommy any more.

45:30.110 --> 45:31.970
I can't remember his face.

45:37.930 --> 45:39.230
Dad!

45:40.290 --> 45:41.590
Help!

45:43.330 --> 45:44.630
Help!

45:55.450 --> 45:57.529
I love you, Dad.

45:57.530 --> 45:58.830
Dad!

46:25.410 --> 46:27.800
When are we going home?

46:48.850 --> 46:50.160
I love you, Dad.

47:16.410 --> 47:17.710
Kyle?

47:19.890 --> 47:21.190
Kyle?

47:21.570 --> 47:22.870
Kyle?

47:23.250 --> 47:24.570
Can you hear me?

47:25.810 --> 47:27.730
Kyle.

47:41.970 --> 47:43.679
Jim Bell.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.640
I think you might be looking for me.

47:51.530 --> 47:52.880
Just need this, please.

47:57.810 --> 48:00.409
<i>I don't pretend to know
if there's an afterlife.</i>

48:00.410 --> 48:01.979
<i>Of course I don't.</i>

48:01.980 --> 48:04.000
<i>I don't preach religious dogma.</i>

48:09.130 --> 48:11.300
<i>But I've been on the cusp
of life and death.</i>

48:14.970 --> 48:16.300
I've seen it.

48:16.610 --> 48:18.510
I watched my father suffer.

48:19.450 --> 48:20.980
I held his hand.

48:22.490 --> 48:24.320
Tell me about the chatroom.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.129
If you read my posts,

48:27.130 --> 48:29.849
you'll see they're mainly
about the sanctity of life.

48:29.850 --> 48:31.289
The joy of it.

48:31.290 --> 48:35.000
And encouraging desperate men
to take their own lives.

48:35.810 --> 48:38.329
You had a message exchange
with Rowan Cole

48:38.330 --> 48:41.149
when he was at Schiphol Airport
in Amsterdam.

48:41.150 --> 48:42.559
Did I?

48:42.560 --> 48:43.949
He messaged you

48:43.950 --> 48:46.769
to say that he was being
put on an alternative flight

48:46.770 --> 48:49.079
but that he still needed
to take his own life,

48:49.080 --> 48:50.660
and you replied...

48:52.370 --> 48:54.009
.."Don't hesitate."

48:54.010 --> 48:57.239
Yes, take the flight.
Don't hesitate.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.169
- Come on!
- Don't wait there alone.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.849
Come home.
Get help.

49:00.850 --> 49:04.400
You're saying what you wrote him
is open to interpretation, are you?

49:08.490 --> 49:10.169
When you were arrested,

49:10.170 --> 49:13.169
you were wearing Kyle Cunningham's
wedding ring.

49:13.170 --> 49:14.489
Why was that?

49:14.490 --> 49:17.149
He gave it to me to give
to his wife.

49:17.150 --> 49:19.029
So you had arranged to meet, then?

49:19.030 --> 49:20.579
In a way, yeah.

49:20.580 --> 49:22.879
He'd hinted previously
that he would go there,

49:22.880 --> 49:24.589
and I went to try and find him.

49:24.590 --> 49:28.600
And when you found him,
you just, what, walked away?

49:30.090 --> 49:32.859
I believe people have the right
to self-determination.

49:32.860 --> 49:34.769
- People in distress?
- Yes.

49:34.770 --> 49:36.369
People who might be mentally ill?

49:36.370 --> 49:38.049
People who could be helped?

49:38.050 --> 49:41.059
- Kyle Cunningham wanted to live.
- No.

49:41.060 --> 49:44.169
No. He crawled out of that
place on his hands and knees.

49:44.170 --> 49:46.100
He's in A&E now.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.849
He told me he wanted to die.

49:48.850 --> 49:51.529
No.
You told him that.

49:51.530 --> 49:55.369
He reached out for help, and
you told him to take his own life.

49:55.370 --> 49:57.129
Why would you do that?

49:57.130 --> 49:59.609
Because you like the feeling
of power it gives you?

49:59.610 --> 50:01.139
People have the right to choose.

50:01.140 --> 50:02.969
Like your father?

50:02.970 --> 50:05.249
He chose what he wanted
for himself, did he,

50:05.250 --> 50:07.159
when he took his own life?

50:07.160 --> 50:09.640
Or did you choose that for him?

50:12.090 --> 50:15.090
Tell me about Peter Sachs'
wedding ring.

50:17.490 --> 50:20.009
He gave it to me, like Kyle did.

50:20.010 --> 50:22.249
Also to pass on to his wife?

50:22.250 --> 50:23.869
No, for myself,

50:23.870 --> 50:26.309
as a gift for trying to help.

50:26.310 --> 50:28.119
His wedding ring.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.500
His marriage meant
nothing to him.

50:31.170 --> 50:32.590
It was a token.

50:33.370 --> 50:36.030
We all know what this is, Jim.

50:37.010 --> 50:40.529
These are killings, pure and simple.

50:40.530 --> 50:42.780
A kind of murder by proxy.

50:43.250 --> 50:45.199
You get to kill all these people

50:45.200 --> 50:48.009
without actually having
to lay a hand on them.

50:48.010 --> 50:50.560
You just encourage them
to do it to themselves,

50:51.070 --> 50:54.740
and then you take a token
to remember them by

50:55.370 --> 50:59.689
and to remind yourself
of how powerful you are.

50:59.690 --> 51:02.630
- How clever.
- No.

51:03.770 --> 51:07.130
They were all desperate men
in their own different ways.

51:08.050 --> 51:10.569
I just tried to help.
That's all I did.

51:10.570 --> 51:12.150
Is that how it began...

51:12.930 --> 51:14.360
..with your father -

51:14.850 --> 51:17.340
helping to end his suffering?

51:18.850 --> 51:20.900
But it felt good, right?

51:21.770 --> 51:23.769
And all of a sudden,

51:23.770 --> 51:25.809
there you are

51:25.810 --> 51:28.630
with all this power.

51:33.170 --> 51:36.529
So we've got enough to charge him
with assisting a suicide,

51:36.530 --> 51:38.119
certainly for Kyle Cunningham,

51:38.120 --> 51:40.980
but we can't prove any more
than that, can we?

51:42.830 --> 51:44.989
This is Peter Sachs'
wedding ring that

51:44.990 --> 51:47.490
Bell says he gave to him.
Want to take a look?

51:47.810 --> 51:49.550
- You see it?
- Sure.

51:49.890 --> 51:52.689
It's a small amount
of gunshot residue.

51:52.690 --> 51:54.969
Which means the ring
was removed from the hand

51:54.970 --> 51:56.859
after the gun had been fired.

51:56.860 --> 51:58.169
After?

51:58.170 --> 52:00.859
Which in turn proves it wasn't
given to Bell by Peter Sachs.

52:00.860 --> 52:03.049
Sachs was already dead
when Bell took it.

52:03.050 --> 52:04.359
So you're saying

52:04.360 --> 52:06.689
James Bell was actually
with Peter Sachs

52:06.690 --> 52:09.889
- when he shot himself?
- More than that. My turn.

52:09.890 --> 52:11.609
James Bell's clothing.

52:11.610 --> 52:13.829
So this is the shirt
we found at his house.

52:13.830 --> 52:16.839
DNA confirms it is
Peter Sachs' blood.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.729
When a gun is fired at someone
from close range,

52:18.730 --> 52:21.749
you can get a fine mist of blood
spraying back from the entry wound.

52:21.750 --> 52:23.059
- OK.
- Peter's hand

52:23.060 --> 52:24.969
showed a minimal amount of this.

52:24.970 --> 52:26.700
James Bell's shirt sleeve,

52:27.290 --> 52:28.590
covered in it.

52:28.970 --> 52:31.459
Obviously, we can't say
exactly what happened.

52:31.460 --> 52:34.560
Perhaps Peter Sachs
changed his mind, but...

52:34.970 --> 52:36.690
James Bell pulled the trigger.

52:57.490 --> 52:59.039
James Bell,

52:59.040 --> 53:01.870
I am charging you with
the murder of Peter Sachs

53:02.580 --> 53:05.459
and the manslaughter of
Alex Vitarnen, Jonathan Kraft

53:05.460 --> 53:06.760
and Miriam Heller,

53:07.450 --> 53:09.909
and, under Section Two
of the Suicide Act,

53:09.910 --> 53:13.329
encouraging or assisting
the suicide of Rowan Cole

53:13.330 --> 53:16.570
and your father
Gregory Anthony Bell.

53:27.290 --> 53:29.200
Hey. Hey, mate.

53:30.090 --> 53:32.790
You want anything?
What can I get you?

53:36.010 --> 53:38.510
Are you ever going
to tell me about Mum?

54:35.610 --> 54:37.159
I'm just waiting for Nikki.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.350
- Sure.
- How's it going?

54:39.810 --> 54:41.720
Good.
You?

54:42.290 --> 54:43.599
Yeah.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.209
Sorry to hear about your friend.

54:45.210 --> 54:47.360
Nikki told me you worked together.

54:48.330 --> 54:50.190
Yeah, he was a good guy.

54:51.890 --> 54:54.090
He was working with Syrian refugees.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.729
Kind of my area.

54:56.730 --> 54:58.680
I was in Damascus
for a couple of years.

55:00.050 --> 55:02.499
At the conference in Amsterdam,

55:02.500 --> 55:04.919
he had asked me to go
along as an advisor.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.120
- OK.
- And I said yes,

55:07.570 --> 55:09.330
but then I pulled out...

55:10.250 --> 55:12.250
..so I could spend time
with Nikki.

55:13.850 --> 55:16.920
You telling me you should
have been on the plane?

55:18.620 --> 55:20.320
I haven't told Nikki yet.

55:24.050 --> 55:25.350
Hi.

55:26.690 --> 55:28.490
I wasn't expecting you.

55:32.170 --> 55:35.119
I'm going to leave you guys to it.
I've left something in here.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.230
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

55:44.810 --> 55:46.110
Hi.

55:48.770 --> 55:50.070
Hi.

56:24.650 --> 56:27.900
- Nikki Alexander, pathologist.
- Jack Hodgson, forensics.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.129
<i>There are strong indicators</i>

56:30.130 --> 56:33.160
<i>that the body discovered
this morning is Jason.</i>

56:33.690 --> 56:36.090
So when you going to pick
Malcolm Wilde up?

56:36.890 --> 56:39.090
<i>I've swabbed for DNA.
We'll see what comes back.</i>

56:41.410 --> 56:44.089
How'd you come by those
scratches on your neck?

56:44.090 --> 56:46.129
Despite what people want to believe,

56:46.130 --> 56:49.860
<i>the person responsible's
unlikely to be an outsider.</i>

56:53.850 --> 56:56.559
<i>Do you see a freezer big enough
to store a body?</i>

56:56.560 --> 56:59.028
<i>We're talking about
the reputation</i>

56:59.029 --> 57:01.439
of an assistant commissioner

57:01.440 --> 57:04.049
<i>widely tipped for the top job.</i>

57:04.050 --> 57:07.159
It's not my fault
you're desperate
and he's not cracking!
