to have a bomb...

had kicked me off the test.

then ask him.

ask if she can call him later...

...and then get his cell phone number.

12:13.213 --> 12:14.885

12:15.053 --> 12:19.968
Uh, my number is 617-555-0194.

- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

12:44.253 --> 12:48.087
So besides Miss Hewitt, there were
56 other people removed from the study.

12:48.253 --> 12:51.211
For a drug of this magnitude,
we have to be extremely cautious.

12:51.373 --> 12:53.284
But what motivated your caution?

12:55.293 --> 12:57.090
Please tell me
it was more than a hunch.

12:57.253 --> 13:00.882
These people do suffer from a crippling,
life-threatening disease, doctor.

13:01.053 --> 13:02.645
As do I.

13:04.293 --> 13:05.612
I'm very sorry.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.882
I understand the promise
of a drug like this...

13:09.053 --> 13:13.683
...on a very personal level, Mr. Shore,
but if it endangers people...

13:13.853 --> 13:15.445
How does it endanger people?

13:17.533 --> 13:22.482
How are these 57 people endangered
by SV113?

13:22.853 --> 13:26.084
Fifty-seven, that's an exceptionally
large number of people to purge...

13:26.253 --> 13:28.130
...isn't it, doctor?

13:28.293 --> 13:30.602
How are these people endangered?

13:32.493 --> 13:33.482
They weren't.

13:34.533 --> 13:38.606
Mary Beth Hewitt and the 56 others
were on a different drug.

13:38.773 --> 13:44.803
It was a slight variation from SV113
that we had only begun to investigate.

13:44.973 --> 13:47.362
These people, they knew
they were on this other drug?

13:47.533 --> 13:48.886
No.

13:49.053 --> 13:53.843
So you gave an experimental,
unapproved drug to 57 people...

13:54.013 --> 13:56.243
...and told them
they were taking something else?

13:56.413 --> 13:58.802
As soon as we became aware
of the side effects...

13:58.973 --> 14:00.531
The headaches?

14:04.453 --> 14:08.924
There was onset of acute liver damage
at about six weeks.

14:09.093 --> 14:12.369
There was one prior subject
who went first, and complications...

14:13.933 --> 14:16.208
Please don't look at me as if...

14:16.373 --> 14:19.922
What could possibly have impelled you
to delude these people?

14:20.093 --> 14:25.167
You can't understand.
It takes years to get a drug approved.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.086
And when you spend your life...
I thought...

14:28.253 --> 14:33.008
The company thought that we had
the next polio vaccine, or penicillin.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.403
Except your penicillin
turned out to be a poison.

14:35.573 --> 14:38.929
But as soon as we discovered it,
the company shut the study down.

14:39.413 --> 14:43.929
That's why Mrs. Hewitt was taken off
the drug she thinks was SV113.

14:44.093 --> 14:46.368
To prevent liver failure.

14:55.493 --> 14:57.165
BARR:
So you're a therapist?

14:57.333 --> 15:00.803
De facto therapist.
I'm really a flight attendant.

15:00.973 --> 15:04.204
- But everybody tells me their problems.
- Oh, do you solve them?

15:04.373 --> 15:07.206
- I do, actually.
- Well, tell me mine.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.523
- I'm sorry?
- My problem.

15:09.693 --> 15:11.763
What am I lamenting
at this very moment?

15:12.813 --> 15:16.010
- I'm embarrassed to say, actually.
- Uh-uh. I insist, tell me.

15:16.173 --> 15:19.483
You're wishing
your girlfriend looked like me.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.166
- Ah, keep going.
- You hate your job.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.291
- Which is?
TARA: I wanna say accountant.

15:28.813 --> 15:31.043
- But I'm gonna say lawyer.
- Oh.

15:32.413 --> 15:35.291
- Am I that obvious?
- I meet lawyers all the time.

15:35.453 --> 15:38.604
They fly a lot.
They're constantly in distress...

15:38.773 --> 15:42.209
...over all the horrible things
they have to do for their horrible clients.

15:42.853 --> 15:46.846
- What are you working on right now?
- A horrible case for a horrible client.

15:48.253 --> 15:50.642
- It's age discrimination.
- Mm. Plaintiff or defense?

15:51.053 --> 15:52.042
Defense.

15:52.573 --> 15:54.768
- Ooh, bad boy.
- Mm-hm.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.571
Indeed.

15:59.693 --> 16:00.682
Whistle blower?

16:00.853 --> 16:03.845
Yes. There are all sorts
of protections to avail yourself of...

16:04.013 --> 16:07.244
Hold on a second. You're advising
a witness to turn state's evidence...

16:07.413 --> 16:09.005
...against your own client?
- I am.

16:09.893 --> 16:12.532
Look, I was the one
who pushed the study.

16:12.693 --> 16:15.332
I was the one who put those people
on that drug.

16:15.493 --> 16:19.122
You were motivated by the
drug's promise, your employer, by greed.

16:19.653 --> 16:21.883
Can't you get disbarred
for advising me to...?

16:22.053 --> 16:24.487
Undoubtedly.
And should you lose your license...

16:24.653 --> 16:27.406
...we can run off to Bali together
and become bartenders.

16:30.173 --> 16:34.007
- My life is here, in medicine.
- Yes.

16:35.653 --> 16:38.770
And you are in a unique position
to remind your employer...

16:38.933 --> 16:43.404
...they, too, are in the business
of medicine, not simply profit.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.171
You need to blow the whistle.
And what's more, you want to.

17:01.173 --> 17:03.243
[SINGING "HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS"]

17:23.933 --> 17:25.207
Hey.

17:25.373 --> 17:27.329
- Denny?
- Set to go?

17:27.492 --> 17:29.006
What are you doing?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.767
Oh, there's an office Christmas party
next week.

17:31.933 --> 17:35.528
I do a number. It's good for morale.
Helps get me laid. Are we off to court?

17:35.693 --> 17:38.605
Actually, I have a feeling court
won't be going forward today.

17:38.773 --> 17:42.129
What do you mean?
Did something happen?

17:42.293 --> 17:44.124
Was I in the room when it happened?

17:44.293 --> 17:47.285
It seems our client is guilty
of a little noncompliance as well.

17:47.453 --> 17:50.445
The actual test that...

17:52.253 --> 17:54.847
- We represent big drug company.
- I'm with you.

17:55.013 --> 17:59.370
Big drug company tell patients they take
one pill, while slipping them another.

18:00.133 --> 18:02.693
- You know this how?
ALAN: Evidently our expert witness...

18:02.853 --> 18:05.925
...comes armed not only with details
but a conscience. She told me.

18:06.093 --> 18:08.004
I believe she plans to tell the FDA.

18:08.173 --> 18:09.652
Oh.

18:10.893 --> 18:11.962
Whistle blower.

18:19.413 --> 18:24.089
- Did you tell her to whistle-blow?
- I might have mentioned it.

18:24.733 --> 18:29.682
Do you know how much this client is
worth to this firm, and to me personally?

18:29.853 --> 18:33.084
Nuts. I knew there was something
I forgot to consider.

18:33.253 --> 18:36.165
- Where is this woman?
- Hopefully with the U.S. Attorney.

18:36.333 --> 18:40.087
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Shore,
there's a Dr. Girard waiting in reception.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.767
- Send her in.
- That's all right. I'll go and greet her.

18:42.933 --> 18:46.005
Send the woman in here.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.085
Here's good.

18:59.093 --> 19:02.130
Oh, Tara, we have a pretrial conference
set on McNamara at 2.

19:02.293 --> 19:03.692
How are you and Sally doing...?

19:03.853 --> 19:06.447
Remember the document that said
McNamara was incorporated...

19:06.613 --> 19:08.808
...in "19efficiency3,"
we thought it was a typo?

19:08.973 --> 19:11.123
- Yeah.
- Well, code broken.

19:11.293 --> 19:13.204
They had a plan called the "40 Factor"...

19:13.373 --> 19:16.490
...which was designed to phase out
workers who were 40 and older.

19:16.653 --> 19:19.850
Replace them with younger employees
who would cost the company less.

19:20.013 --> 19:23.050
Right. They actually described the plan
in memoranda...

19:23.213 --> 19:25.773
...which were archived
on the company's hard drives.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.332
Gotta love the hubris.

19:27.493 --> 19:30.087
But they then got nervous
and did a search and replace...

19:30.253 --> 19:32.483
...to substitute the word "efficiency"
for "40."

19:32.653 --> 19:35.042
And 1943 became 19efficiency3.

19:35.213 --> 19:37.204
- Exactly.
- Wait, how did you find this out?

19:37.373 --> 19:40.410
I had drinks with opposing counsel
last night. Quite a talker.

19:40.573 --> 19:42.325
Wait a second,
he admitted this to you?

19:42.493 --> 19:44.882
Well, actually he admitted it
to a flight attendant.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.090
He didn't know that I was an attorney
for the other side.

19:49.053 --> 19:51.886
Why not smiling?
Why are we not smiling?

19:52.053 --> 19:54.692
- Tara, we can't use this information.
- I beg your pardon?

19:54.853 --> 19:58.209
You tricked another attorney into
violating privilege. You can't do that.

19:58.373 --> 20:01.888
- Last week you impersonated a doctor.
- First, that was different.

20:02.053 --> 20:04.692
- Second, the stakes were life and death.
- Lori...

20:04.853 --> 20:08.732
And third, I was wrong.
In retrospect, I would never do it again.

20:08.893 --> 20:13.125
Well, we have the information, Lori.
So if it's a matter of ethics...

20:13.293 --> 20:16.330
...we absolutely have to tell the client
that we have it.

20:21.573 --> 20:22.562
[SIGHS]

20:22.893 --> 20:25.453
- I just don't think I can do it.
- Because?

20:25.613 --> 20:28.605
Alan, these people have been
very good to me for 10 years.

20:28.773 --> 20:31.048
Now, by people,
you mean these corporate people...

20:31.213 --> 20:34.171
...who jeopardize public health
and safety on a massive scale...

20:34.333 --> 20:35.925
...in order to line their pockets?

20:36.093 --> 20:39.324
They were convinced we had a possible
cure based on my representations.

20:39.493 --> 20:41.927
I would as soon blow the whistle
on myself rather...

20:42.093 --> 20:44.812
- Do that then.
- And what good would come of it?

20:44.973 --> 20:46.804
- Really?
DENNY: May I express a thought?

20:46.973 --> 20:48.452
I so rarely get one.

20:48.613 --> 20:52.288
I should preface this by admitting that
I'm so far up the ass of big business...

20:52.453 --> 20:54.489
...I view the world
as one giant colon.

20:54.653 --> 20:58.612
You're right to prioritize loyalty, doctor.
Loyalties count for something.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.968
- Denny, please...
- I'm speaking, Alan.

21:01.133 --> 21:03.203
Doctors like science, right?
They do the math.

21:03.373 --> 21:07.412
Well, do the math on whistle-blowing.
Nice concept in theory.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.326
Appeals to the altruistic inner self
and all that.

21:12.413 --> 21:15.883
But whistle blowers end up penniless
and ostracized.

21:16.053 --> 21:20.331
This thing will take years to get to court,
while your life will be ruined tomorrow.

21:20.493 --> 21:22.768
- Denny...
- And if Alan Shore suggested...

21:22.933 --> 21:27.051
...you won't get hurt far worse
than your company, he's lying.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.850
What's going on?

21:35.413 --> 21:38.371
Our client is violating at least
a half a dozen criminal laws...

21:38.533 --> 21:42.208
...by secretly testing an unapproved
drug, which causes liver failure...

21:42.373 --> 21:44.603
...on unwitting human guinea pigs.

21:44.773 --> 21:47.162
Dr. Girard is considering
whether to go public.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.847
I'm for it, Denny's against.
Do you have a vote?

21:50.013 --> 21:52.288
You seem like a man
with a scintilla of morality.

21:53.533 --> 21:58.402
Alan, my vote's the only one
that counts, and I'm not going public.

21:58.573 --> 22:00.803
You say that as if you have a choice,
doctor.

22:00.973 --> 22:05.251
You see, the only way our client
wins here is with your testimony.

22:05.453 --> 22:08.206
So the clerk will swear you in,
you'll take an oath to God.

22:08.373 --> 22:12.286
But as a scientist, you are bound
to an even higher standard.

22:12.613 --> 22:14.444
To believe in God,
all you need is faith.

22:14.613 --> 22:17.207
To believe in science,
you need to see the truth.

22:17.373 --> 22:19.967
You need to speak the truth.
Am I right?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.890
If asked certain questions under oath,
you will answer truthfully...

22:24.053 --> 22:26.965
...because that's who you are.
GIRARD: You don't know me.

22:27.133 --> 22:30.682
And you would never ask me questions
that would torpedo your own case.

22:30.853 --> 22:32.445
Ah.

22:32.773 --> 22:35.526
It seems it's you
that doesn't know me.

22:45.373 --> 22:47.489
Isn't it exciting?

22:53.213 --> 22:55.681
It's absolutely unethical, Tara,
for God's sakes!

22:55.853 --> 22:58.321
- Please don't lecture me.
- This lecture is called for.

22:58.493 --> 23:01.530
Attorneys at this firm
do not go undercover as stewardesses...

23:01.693 --> 23:04.890
...to circumvent privilege. It is fraud.
It is wrong. It is dishonest.

23:05.053 --> 23:07.362
It holds every member of this firm
up to disrepute.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.444
- Breathe.
- It hurts other clients at this firm.

23:09.613 --> 23:11.092
- Mine, Paul's, Lori's.
- How?

23:11.253 --> 23:13.483
- Breathe.
- Our reputation for fair dealing...

23:13.653 --> 23:16.486
...is at play at every conference,
every motion, every trial.

23:16.653 --> 23:20.248
If that reputation is compromised,
the stain runs to all cases. Not just the...

23:20.413 --> 23:23.246
- Breathe.
- I know how and when to breathe!

23:25.093 --> 23:26.651
This is about Alan Shore.

23:27.893 --> 23:30.885
- It's about some not-so-latent hostility...
- You're out of line.

23:31.053 --> 23:33.567
You're out of line.
You fancy the pants off Alan Shore.

23:33.733 --> 23:37.362
So as long as we're preaching honesty,
let's be truthful about that.

23:40.893 --> 23:44.806
You know something, Tara?
This does involve Alan.

23:44.973 --> 23:46.725
What happened
in that bar last night...

23:46.893 --> 23:48.849
...you heard opposing counsel
on his phone.

23:49.013 --> 23:52.085
You sensed a great opportunity.
You asked what would Alan Shore do.

23:52.253 --> 23:53.925
You likely did what he would have.

23:54.093 --> 23:58.086
- You've never done that, say, last week?
- No. I did. And as I said, I was wrong.

24:02.973 --> 24:05.282
That's all. You can go.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.049
- What are you gonna do?
- Haven't decided.

24:12.213 --> 24:14.727
- Well, you can't not use...
- I haven't decided, Tara.

24:16.573 --> 24:18.131
You're dismissed.

24:31.573 --> 24:37.011
Well, I'm sorry I lost my cool.
But you handled that perfectly.

24:37.413 --> 24:39.005
Thank you.

24:40.573 --> 24:43.610
Did that have anything
to do with Alan?

24:44.693 --> 24:46.490
How does he do it?

24:46.653 --> 24:51.204
No matter what I do, no matter what
anyone else says, it's always about Alan.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.763
It was just a question.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.724
I should be the example for the young
associates around here, not him.

24:58.893 --> 25:02.169
- Well, Tara is Alan's girlfriend.
- Why is that?

25:03.773 --> 25:07.652
I mean, why is she interested in him?
I ask you.

25:08.413 --> 25:12.804
- Do you fancy Tara, Brad?
- No, I'm just speaking in general terms.

25:12.973 --> 25:16.045
- All the women here...
- Yeah, you keep saying "all the women."

25:17.653 --> 25:20.486
- But who, specifically, Brad?
- Look, you're missing the point.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.371
Okay.

25:23.933 --> 25:25.730
And the point is?

25:26.293 --> 25:30.445
I diffuse a human bomb. Does anyone
say, "Oh, are you okay, Brad?"

25:30.613 --> 25:32.888
"Oh, nice job saving lives, Brad."
No, it's:

25:33.053 --> 25:36.887
"Tara circumvented privilege
because she's sleeping with Alan."

25:40.613 --> 25:43.252
I'm the only one talking
about Tara and privilege.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.806
Is this about me?

25:49.333 --> 25:52.325
We're buddies, Brad. Talk to me.

25:54.213 --> 25:55.646
Okay.

25:59.773 --> 26:01.968
I'd like to be more than buddies.

26:04.413 --> 26:08.691
I don't bring it up,
because I sense it's something...

26:08.853 --> 26:11.731
...that you're not interested
in pursuing.

26:12.493 --> 26:14.211
Okay.

26:14.733 --> 26:17.964
Is it something you'd like to pursue?

26:19.373 --> 26:21.091
Um...

26:22.093 --> 26:23.367
No.

26:24.933 --> 26:26.605
Right.

26:34.853 --> 26:38.766
Anyway, you handled the meeting well.

26:47.893 --> 26:50.885
You surprise me, Denny.
I thought you'd be with me on this.

26:51.053 --> 26:53.772
- There's a deeper principle involved here.
- Which is?

26:54.533 --> 26:57.331
Fishing. There's a fishing lodge
in British Columbia.

26:57.493 --> 27:01.850
It's called Nimmo Bay.
Best fishing lodge in the world.

27:02.013 --> 27:04.402
In the Great Bear Rainforest.

27:05.093 --> 27:10.451
- How does this lodge affect...?
- Want to buy it. Costs lots of money.

27:11.053 --> 27:13.772
If I lose this client,
I might not be able to buy it.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.322
- You have plenty of money.
- Yes, to buy other things.

27:16.493 --> 27:20.247
This case, this client is earmarked
for this fishing lodge.

27:21.693 --> 27:24.844
Well, if I can't convince you,
I guess I can't convince you.

27:25.533 --> 27:30.084
Alan, I'll ask Dr. Girard the questions
this afternoon.

27:30.253 --> 27:32.562
- I've prepared the direct.
- I'll ask the questions.

27:32.733 --> 27:34.485
- I'm questioning her.
- No, you aren't.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.292
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes.
- No, you aren't. No. No.

27:37.453 --> 27:40.684
- Yes.
PAUL: This time I will cast a vote.

27:40.853 --> 27:42.923
Let me make this simple for you,
Mr. Shore.

27:43.093 --> 27:45.846
Please, call me Alan.
I feel we've grown close.

27:47.213 --> 27:51.331
You will be present in court, at the table,
because your sudden absence...

27:51.493 --> 27:54.007
...would send a strange message
to the jury...

27:54.333 --> 27:59.088
...that might compromise our case.
But Denny will ask the questions.

27:59.253 --> 28:04.691
If you attempt to ask the witness
anything at all, you will be fired.

28:07.133 --> 28:10.921
There's a legal term for this. Ah, yes:

28:11.093 --> 28:12.208
Ooh.

28:13.013 --> 28:15.481
This is not puffery on my part,
Mr. Shore.

28:15.653 --> 28:19.487
I have spoken with other senior partners.
We are in agreement. The votes are in.

28:19.653 --> 28:23.805
If you attempt to undermine our case
in any way...

28:23.973 --> 28:28.808
...your employment will be terminated.
- In that event, I will go to cable.

28:36.373 --> 28:38.409
Denny, you and I should go open
our own firm.

28:38.573 --> 28:40.848
I'll ask the questions, Alan.

28:45.733 --> 28:48.008
I'll leave you with this one
last thought then:

28:50.013 --> 28:52.368
Denny Crane.

29:19.053 --> 29:21.692
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:23.773 --> 29:27.766
The lawyer from McNamara, the guy
Tara duped, he'll be in here at 2.

29:28.213 --> 29:32.206
I've summoned Tara as well.
I'll try to iron things out a little.

29:32.653 --> 29:34.405
That's good.

29:36.773 --> 29:40.448
- Lf you could make it, then...
- Fine, 2 p.m.

29:42.253 --> 29:44.687
Would you mind looking at me
for a second?

29:48.373 --> 29:52.605
You and I have a big murder trial
scheduled for next week.

29:53.093 --> 29:57.291
- Are we gonna be okay?
- We're fine.

29:58.413 --> 30:00.973
Do you plan to speak to me
in marine talk forever?

30:01.573 --> 30:05.168
No, sir. Sir.

30:06.533 --> 30:09.286
You're a great guy, you're a smart guy,
an attractive guy.

30:09.453 --> 30:12.092
- Any girl would...
- Meeting's at 2.

30:12.493 --> 30:14.085
Right.

30:15.493 --> 30:16.767
Two.

30:30.613 --> 30:34.288
- Do you even know what to ask?
- Did she examine the plaintiff?

30:34.453 --> 30:37.172
Did she feel the plaintiff complied
with the study protocol?

30:37.333 --> 30:41.167
She'll say yes or no. Get in a bunch of
rhetoric about the need for safeguards.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.767
- Then we'll go have a cheesesteak.
- You can live with yourself?

Please empty out all your pockets, sir.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.925
Alan?

31:06.093 --> 31:08.687
- You need to open your briefcase.
- Do you know who I am?

31:09.093 --> 31:11.129
You'll need to open your case.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.005
- Alan!
- Can you step this way, sir?

31:23.173 --> 31:25.767
- You checking me for bombs?
- It's a federal offense...

31:25.933 --> 31:28.322
...to joke about explosives
at a security checkpoint.

31:28.493 --> 31:31.883
- I've gotta get upstairs.

31:36.653 --> 31:40.726
- Where's Denny?
- He got held up. Not to worry.

31:40.893 --> 31:44.203
- Mr. Shore, are we ready to proceed?
- We are, Your Honor.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.443
The defense calls Dr. Amanda Girard.

I need to see him in his chambers now.

32:16.533 --> 32:18.251
What kind of nonsense is this?

32:18.413 --> 32:21.450
You put an ice pick in his pocket
and a picture of Saddam Hussein?

32:21.613 --> 32:22.887
You pull a fire alarm?

32:23.053 --> 32:25.886
We're at odds as to how to proceed
with the witness.

32:26.053 --> 32:29.250
Yes, I heard that. You're supposed
to be adults, for God's sake.

32:29.413 --> 32:31.802
You're lawyers.
And on the same side, at that!

32:31.973 --> 32:34.692
Your Honor, there are unusual
circumstances in play.

32:34.853 --> 32:38.323
I'm interested in truth and justice.
My colleague favors a fishing lodge.

32:38.493 --> 32:41.212
Look, I don't give a damn
what your differences are.

32:41.373 --> 32:44.092
- First off, your firm is fined $50,000.
- What?

32:44.253 --> 32:48.041
Second, whatever either of you do in
that court, you both get held responsible.

32:48.213 --> 32:51.967
You understand me? Third. Mr. Crane,
since you're the named partner...

32:52.133 --> 32:54.886
...and it is your client,
I'll let you have the floor.

32:55.053 --> 32:58.762
- Your Honor, I have prepared...
- Keep your mouth shut, Mr. Shore.

33:00.613 --> 33:02.251
Now, let's get back inside.

33:16.453 --> 33:20.048
- Please have a seat, Tara.
- Tara?

33:24.173 --> 33:28.052
- All right, what's going on?
- We have a situation, Mr. Barr.

33:28.533 --> 33:30.524
Tara is an attorney
who works for this firm.

33:30.693 --> 33:32.763
You gave her information...

33:32.933 --> 33:35.367
...about an efficiency factor
employed by your client.

33:35.533 --> 33:37.763
This would be considered
privileged information.

33:37.933 --> 33:41.448
- I never revealed who my client was.
- We already knew who the client was.

33:43.293 --> 33:46.490
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Both you and Miss Wilson...

33:46.653 --> 33:48.405
That's her real last name, Wilson.

33:48.573 --> 33:51.246
Both you and she have committed
serious violations.

33:51.413 --> 33:54.928
You would likely lose your job and get
a suspension. You would get worse.

33:55.093 --> 33:59.211
It would be in the best interest of all
if this situation didn't become public.

33:59.373 --> 34:03.491
My problem, as Tara correctly points out,
is having the information.

34:04.013 --> 34:07.892
I have an obligation to tell my clients,
who, undoubtedly, would elect to use it.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.803
I'm also obliged to safeguard privilege,
even when it's on the other side.

34:11.973 --> 34:13.690
So as I said, we've got a situation.

34:15.933 --> 34:20.290
Where we last left off in settlement
discussions, our number was 3.2 million.

34:20.453 --> 34:23.206
Yours was 2. 1. The deal probably
makes somewhere in between.

34:23.373 --> 34:26.170
My proposal to you, Mr. Barr,
is we settle it at 3.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.527
- I don't think I could sell it.
- You sell it...

34:28.693 --> 34:30.603
...by telling your client
and colleagues...

34:30.773 --> 34:34.368
...that the other side knows about
the factor. We broke the code.

34:34.533 --> 34:38.208
How we found out, we won't reveal.
That protects you, it protects Tara.

34:38.373 --> 34:39.772
You profit from her deception.

34:39.973 --> 34:43.522
We profit somewhat from her deception
combined with your stupidity.

34:43.933 --> 34:46.811
If we wanted to exploit it,
we'd go to trial and tell a jury...

34:46.973 --> 34:49.533
...which, technically, I should advise
my clients to do.

34:49.933 --> 34:53.130
Our side profits some. Your side
gets off with a pretty mild number...

34:53.293 --> 34:56.649
...given the smoking gun. And you two
get off with your careers.

34:59.253 --> 35:04.247
Now, if you have a better proposal,
I'm listening.

35:14.493 --> 35:16.529
GIRARD:
It wasn't just my determination...

35:16.693 --> 35:19.002
...but the consensus
of all the treating doctors.

35:19.173 --> 35:22.483
- Mrs. Hewitt was smoking.
- And others were excluded too, right?

35:22.653 --> 35:24.962
Yes, 56 others.

35:25.133 --> 35:27.806
It is common to weed out subjects
as you go along...

35:27.973 --> 35:30.282
...in order to protect the integrity
of the study.

35:30.453 --> 35:33.445
And this was all about
the integrity of the study?

35:33.773 --> 35:35.172
- Yes.
- I believe you.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.801
You strike me as an honest woman.

35:39.093 --> 35:42.369
- Uh, do you believe in God, doctor?
- I do.

35:43.213 --> 35:45.773
"God as my witness."
That's what it says in the oath.

35:45.933 --> 35:48.288

watches over me too.

- You believe in facts, the truth?
- Yes.

Good. Will you tell the court
exactly why...

36:01.893 --> 36:05.203
...Mary Beth Hewitt was removed
from the trial of SV113?

36:10.253 --> 36:12.483
- I just did.
DENNY: You said smoking.

36:12.653 --> 36:14.644
The plaintiff believes that
to be a pretext.

36:15.053 --> 36:19.046
I'm asking you to declare it
one more time, before God, the judge...

36:19.213 --> 36:23.525
...Mr. Shore, me. The truth.

36:24.293 --> 36:26.045
Why was she taken off the study?

36:34.893 --> 36:36.292

right down the plate.

it was smoking.
