Charlie Rogers: Tell us your name, please.

00:16.094 --> 00:18.229
Bill Ferguson.

00:18.231 --> 00:20.564
And what's your relationship to Ryan?

00:20.566 --> 00:23.103
He's my son...

00:24.938 --> 00:26.503
and I'm totally convinced

00:26.505 --> 00:28.141
that he is innocent.

Chuck Erickson: On Halloween,
October 31 of 2001...

00:49.028 --> 00:51.364
where was I when this guy got killed?

00:53.098 --> 00:55.769
I didn't know what I'd done that night.

00:57.437 --> 01:02.141
I didn't know if it was
memory or if it was a dream.

01:03.309 --> 01:06.313
I assumed that if I'd done it...

01:08.414 --> 01:12.352
Ryan and I did it to get
more money for drinks.

01:14.119 --> 01:16.019
I don't really blame people

01:16.021 --> 01:18.288
for hearing things and calling the police.

01:18.290 --> 01:21.494
I guess I subconsciously wanted
to get the story out there.

01:24.230 --> 01:25.061
Erickson, on phone: All right. 911?

01:25.063 --> 01:25.895
Female dispatcher: Uh-huh.

01:25.897 --> 01:27.231
This is not an emergency,

01:27.233 --> 01:28.432
but I got something

01:28.434 --> 01:29.966
that I really need to fucking say.

01:29.968 --> 01:31.135
OK.

01:31.137 --> 01:33.136
I know something that
went down two years ago

01:33.138 --> 01:34.504
that I have to fucking say.

01:34.506 --> 01:36.173
- OK.
- All right.

01:36.175 --> 01:38.141
You know the reporter at the "Tribune"

01:38.143 --> 01:39.477
that was murdered

01:39.479 --> 01:41.144
and no one found out who it was?

01:41.146 --> 01:42.313
Uh-huh.

01:42.315 --> 01:45.318
I know what happened,
and I know the murderer.

01:49.421 --> 01:51.288
John Short: Some of
the buildings and things

01:51.290 --> 01:53.057
have not really changed much

01:53.059 --> 01:56.796
since, uh, the day of the incident.

02:00.099 --> 02:00.998
Short: Yes.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.433
You see where this Jeep is at

02:02.435 --> 02:04.100
right up here, this kind of

02:04.102 --> 02:06.103
a beige-colored Jeep?

02:06.105 --> 02:08.472
That is the parking spot

02:08.473 --> 02:13.044
where, um, Mr. Heitholt had his car parked.

02:13.046 --> 02:15.315
Does this look familiar to you?

02:18.483 --> 02:21.318
Short: Had you and... and Ryan performed

02:21.320 --> 02:23.955
any robberies at all prior to this?

02:23.957 --> 02:25.592
- No.
- All right.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.592
Ryan, voice-over: It was
actually a really nice day.

02:29.594 --> 02:32.195
I only lived about a mile from school,

02:32.197 --> 02:34.164
and driving down the one-lane road,

02:34.166 --> 02:35.533
there was a car behind me.

02:35.535 --> 02:37.568
It was this big Tahoe, you
know, these two big guys in it,

02:37.570 --> 02:40.471
and they're on my tail, and I take a right

02:40.473 --> 02:43.106
to go into my apartment
complex, and right when I park,

02:43.108 --> 02:45.509
that same truck is pulling up behind me,

02:45.511 --> 02:47.243
and these two guys are getting out,

02:47.245 --> 02:48.611
like, as I'm opening my door.

02:48.613 --> 02:50.013
I don't think they had badges,
but they had guns and stuff,

02:50.015 --> 02:54.354
and they were talking about
FBI, so they put me in this car.

03:11.536 --> 03:12.571
You know, I...

03:31.656 --> 03:33.691
Bill, voice-over: Leslie called and said,

03:33.693 --> 03:35.359
"Have you heard that Ryan's been arrested?"

03:35.361 --> 03:36.826
I go, "That is ridiculous."

03:36.828 --> 03:40.563
I go, you know, "It's got to be
another Ryan Ferguson, whatever.

03:40.565 --> 03:42.800
I... I guarantee you, that did not happen,"

03:42.802 --> 03:45.438
so she goes, "That's what I thought. OK."

04:03.655 --> 04:05.557
Well, you...

04:07.427 --> 04:09.592
Let's... let's just stop right here, OK?

04:09.594 --> 04:10.795
Now...

04:10.797 --> 04:11.696
[Clears throat]

04:11.698 --> 04:13.596
one thing I'm not gonna do is,

04:13.598 --> 04:15.565
I'm not gonna sit here and listen

04:15.567 --> 04:18.334
to this kind of gibberish, OK?

04:18.336 --> 04:19.536
That's not... I'm not gonna waste my time

04:19.538 --> 04:20.737
- doing this.
- I'm not...

04:20.738 --> 04:22.238
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.440
Wait. Now listen. It's my...

04:23.442 --> 04:24.742
I'm gonna start talking,

04:24.744 --> 04:27.077
and you're gonna start listening, OK?

04:27.079 --> 04:28.446
All right.

04:28.448 --> 04:31.281
I'm gonna be point blank with you, pal.

04:31.283 --> 04:33.850
Right now, your hind end

04:33.852 --> 04:36.353
is the one that's hanging over the edge,

04:36.355 --> 04:38.689
and Ryan could care less about it,

04:38.691 --> 04:40.357
- OK.
- OK?

04:40.359 --> 04:42.093
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

04:42.095 --> 04:43.526
- OK.
- Yes.

04:43.528 --> 04:47.230
Now, you better start thinking

04:47.232 --> 04:49.466
- very clearly
- OK.

04:49.468 --> 04:52.202
because it's you

04:52.204 --> 04:54.637
that is on this chopping block.

04:54.639 --> 04:55.706
OK.

04:55.708 --> 04:59.410
What I want to hear is exactly what Ryan

04:59.412 --> 05:02.579
told you because that's
what's gonna keep you

05:02.581 --> 05:06.317
in a position to where you're not gonna be

05:06.319 --> 05:10.120
the sole individual out here responsible

05:10.122 --> 05:11.889
for what happened to Kent.

05:11.891 --> 05:13.324
OK.

05:13.326 --> 05:15.158
Whose idea was it to go get money

05:15.160 --> 05:17.360
because you wanted drinks,

05:17.362 --> 05:19.362
you wanted dope, whatever you wanted?

05:19.364 --> 05:22.569
Ryan's idea.

05:24.836 --> 05:26.336
[Sighs]

05:26.338 --> 05:27.605
How you holding up?

05:27.607 --> 05:29.273
Ain't, like, holding up good, man.

05:29.275 --> 05:30.641
Pretty rough.

05:30.643 --> 05:32.408
Um, I'll be honest with you.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.644
I came in here because I got a boy your age

05:34.646 --> 05:37.050
and I see that you're hurting in here.

05:38.216 --> 05:40.283
I can see you're hurting,

05:40.285 --> 05:41.552
and you're not quite knowing what to do.

05:41.554 --> 05:43.423
You're not quite knowing what to say.

05:45.691 --> 05:46.622
I understand.

05:46.624 --> 05:49.425
Well, if I could stand in for him

05:49.427 --> 05:50.694
for just a little bit...
because, like I say,

05:50.696 --> 05:52.163
when I'm looking at you,

05:52.165 --> 05:53.264
I'm looking at my own son...

05:53.266 --> 05:55.365
you know, sometimes when we do things to...

05:55.367 --> 05:56.667
We do things that I don't know why

05:56.669 --> 05:58.201
we do it as human beings,

05:58.203 --> 05:59.103
and I even do it, too.

05:59.105 --> 06:00.237
I do things that hurt myself.

06:00.239 --> 06:01.105
I mean, I know where
you're going with this,

06:01.107 --> 06:03.574
but I... I didn't do anything.

06:03.576 --> 06:04.807
- I hear you.
- I'm innocent.

06:04.809 --> 06:06.744
Right. OK, so you're innocent

06:06.746 --> 06:07.677
of killing this guy.

06:07.679 --> 06:10.314
I'm innocent of even being there.

06:10.316 --> 06:13.385
I'm not involved in this in any way.

06:17.523 --> 06:19.589
Mm, go back to when you said that...

06:19.591 --> 06:21.559
that you hit this guy
with... with the tool.

06:21.561 --> 06:23.593
Um, how many times did you think

06:23.595 --> 06:25.261
you hit him altogether?

06:25.263 --> 06:26.663
- Just once.
- Just once?

06:26.665 --> 06:27.665
Well, the only problem is...

06:27.667 --> 06:28.665
The only problem I have with that is,

06:28.667 --> 06:29.567
I know that he was hit more than once

06:29.569 --> 06:30.600
- Yeah.
- with the tool because...

06:30.602 --> 06:32.370
I'm saying, like, I just hit him once.

06:32.372 --> 06:33.271
You just hit him once?

06:33.273 --> 06:34.838
You didn't hit him more than...

06:34.840 --> 06:35.838
No.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.307
Now, we know

06:37.309 --> 06:38.608
what the guy got strangled with.

06:38.610 --> 06:39.543
That's kind of a thing I've been

06:39.545 --> 06:42.478
holding back from you, all right?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.680
Is it possible you know what he was

06:43.682 --> 06:45.583
strangled with and just
didn't want to tell me?

06:45.585 --> 06:46.684
- Because I... I know...
- Uh, no.

06:46.686 --> 06:48.418
Like, I think it was a shirt or something.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.221
Well, I know it wasn't a shirt.

06:50.223 --> 06:51.689
Like, uh, maybe a bungee cord

06:51.691 --> 06:53.557
or, um, something from his car.

06:53.559 --> 06:55.358
I don't see why he'd
have a rope in his car.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.927
Well, we know for a fact that his belt

06:56.929 --> 06:57.894
was ripped off of his pants

06:57.896 --> 06:59.362
and he was strangled with his belt.

06:59.364 --> 07:00.730
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:00.732 --> 07:02.600
Did you see a belt in Ryan's hand,

07:02.602 --> 07:03.901
something that looked like a rope,

07:03.903 --> 07:05.769
maybe, or a bungee cord?

07:05.771 --> 07:08.374
I don't know.

07:10.977 --> 07:12.679
But why would you say that?

07:14.513 --> 07:15.545
Like I was saying, he...

07:15.547 --> 07:17.281
He can't make stuff up that only people

07:17.283 --> 07:18.281
that were there know about

07:18.283 --> 07:19.649
that we never released to the press.

07:19.651 --> 07:20.651
Then maybe he was there.

07:20.653 --> 07:22.485
Oh, it ain't no maybe. He was there.

07:22.487 --> 07:24.254
OK. Well, I wasn't with him.

07:24.256 --> 07:25.956
Well, but you can't have it both ways, OK?

07:25.958 --> 07:27.557
Yeah, but I don't know what happened.

07:27.559 --> 07:28.891
You guys are asking me
like... like I know, man.

07:28.893 --> 07:29.893
But you're saying...

07:29.895 --> 07:30.726
I don't know.

07:30.728 --> 07:31.761
You're saying, he's lying,

07:31.763 --> 07:33.396
he's making it up, maybe he was there.

07:33.398 --> 07:34.398
You can't have both ways.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.232
Either you don't know

07:35.234 --> 07:36.065
what he's talking about...

07:36.067 --> 07:36.966
I don't know what the hell

07:36.968 --> 07:37.800
he's talking about, all right?

07:37.802 --> 07:39.670
I don't know if he's lying.

07:39.672 --> 07:40.704
I don't know if he was there.

07:40.706 --> 07:42.006
You say he's there, OK, he was there.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.173
I wasn't.

07:43.175 --> 07:44.007
It comes down to just
people believing people,

07:44.009 --> 07:46.442
- Yeah. Well...
- and right now,

07:46.444 --> 07:47.944
nobody believes you.

07:47.946 --> 07:49.180
Well, it sucks, dude.

07:49.182 --> 07:51.281
It does suck because you're
not telling the truth.

07:51.283 --> 07:53.350
Um, y'all can say it

07:53.352 --> 07:54.951
a hundred fucking times, all right?

07:54.953 --> 07:57.620
I'm telling the truth.
I'm telling the truth, man.

07:57.622 --> 08:00.591
There's nothing else I can say or do

08:00.593 --> 08:02.358
to prove my innocence, man.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.165
- I was not with Chuck.
- OK, OK.

08:14.706 --> 08:16.973
Bill, voice-over: There
was a knock at the door.

08:16.975 --> 08:19.643
So it's, like, 8:00 in the evening.

08:19.645 --> 08:21.011
It was dark, I remember.

08:21.013 --> 08:23.379
I went to the door, and there
were two young people there,

08:23.381 --> 08:25.315
like college age.

08:25.317 --> 08:26.850
One of them had a tape recorder,

08:26.852 --> 08:29.052
and, uh, they go, "Are you Mr. Ferguson?"

08:29.054 --> 08:30.453
I go, "I am."

08:30.455 --> 08:33.023
They go, uh, uh, "We just want
to know if you have a comment.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.024
Your son's been arrested for murder."

08:35.025 --> 08:38.062
I go, "What?" I said, "No.
That... that's not even possible."

08:38.063 --> 08:42.666
They go, "Well, is he born,
uh, on October the 19th, 1984?"

08:42.668 --> 08:44.802
I go, "Yeah." They go,
"Well, it's your son."

08:44.804 --> 08:46.836
I go, "OK. Well, first thing,

08:46.838 --> 08:48.672
"I want you to turn off that tape recorder,

08:48.674 --> 08:51.475
"and the second thing, I
want you to say good-bye

08:51.477 --> 08:53.409
because I have nothing to say."

08:53.411 --> 08:55.111
Teresa Snow: There is a big
break tonight in the murder

08:55.113 --> 08:58.716
of former "Columbia Tribune"
sports editor Kent Heitholt.

08:58.718 --> 09:00.750
We go live to John
Bassford, who is standing by

09:00.752 --> 09:02.786
at the Columbia Police
Department with more.

09:02.788 --> 09:03.620
John?

09:03.622 --> 09:04.654
Teresa, police made the arrest

09:04.656 --> 09:06.789
in this more-than-
2 1/2-year-old case

09:06.791 --> 09:09.692
just this afternoon after receiving a tip.

09:09.694 --> 09:11.729
It must feel good to you
all to have some resolution,

09:11.731 --> 09:13.029
finally, to this case.

09:13.031 --> 09:15.732
There is some celebration
that's involved in at least

09:15.734 --> 09:18.601
having some closure to a case of this type.

09:18.603 --> 09:20.537
Kevin Crane: First of
all, you look at their age

09:20.539 --> 09:23.773
on November 1, 2001,
when the murder occurred.

09:23.775 --> 09:27.945
Both these individuals
were 17 as of that day,

09:27.947 --> 09:32.716
and, uh, being age 17 is
an adult under Missouri law.

09:32.718 --> 09:36.086
Mr. Erickson is charged with
murder in the second degree.

09:36.088 --> 09:39.155
Ferguson is charged with
murder in the first degree,

09:39.157 --> 09:43.860
is punishable by life
without parole or death.

09:43.862 --> 09:45.662
We're trying to figure out
how this all came about.

09:45.664 --> 09:47.730
How... how did... how'd we
end up in this situation?

09:47.732 --> 09:49.432
How did Ryan end up in this situation?

09:49.434 --> 09:51.938
It's like being in a bad movie.

09:52.972 --> 09:56.139
[Telephone rings]

09:56.141 --> 10:00.045
Voice: Hello. This is
a collect call from...

10:01.112 --> 10:03.714
Voice: an inmate at the Boone County Jail.

10:03.716 --> 10:05.816
To accept charges, press zero.

10:05.818 --> 10:08.786
This call is subject to
monitoring and recording.

10:08.788 --> 10:10.120
Bill: Ryan. Ryan?

10:10.122 --> 10:11.455
Ryan: Hello.

10:11.457 --> 10:13.826
Oh, my God, OK. How you doing?

10:19.698 --> 10:21.000
They didn't give you any food?

10:24.602 --> 10:25.804
OK.

10:28.907 --> 10:30.642
Oh, man.

10:33.112 --> 10:34.079
Yeah.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.849
OK. Is there anything else I can do?

10:38.851 --> 10:41.386
Uh, no, not for real.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.024
Wh... what?

10:54.532 --> 10:56.700
Voice: You have one minute left.

10:56.702 --> 10:57.734
We have a minute left, Dad.

10:57.736 --> 10:58.601
I heard that.

10:58.603 --> 11:00.003
Come visit me when you can.

11:00.005 --> 11:01.071
I love you.

11:01.073 --> 11:02.673
I'm gonna talk to you whenever, I guess.

11:02.675 --> 11:03.841
- OK.
- All right, Dad.

11:03.843 --> 11:04.975
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

11:04.977 --> 11:06.710
- Talk to you later.
- OK. Bye.

11:06.712 --> 11:08.144
See you.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.847
Bill: We asked for
bail, and the judge said,

11:10.849 --> 11:13.484
"All right. Um, let me think about it.

11:13.486 --> 11:14.851
"All right.

11:14.853 --> 11:17.254
Uh, it'll be, uh, $20 million."

11:17.256 --> 11:20.957
There was a collective
gasp in the courtroom,

11:20.959 --> 11:23.192
2/3 of them being attorneys.

11:23.194 --> 11:24.961
"Huh?"

11:24.963 --> 11:28.097
and then they all
immediately look back at us,

11:28.099 --> 11:29.466
and I had this, like...

11:29.468 --> 11:33.036
for a moment, felt like saying,
"Would you take a check?"

11:33.038 --> 11:37.640
uh, but I didn't, and, uh,
everybody was just shocked.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.176
It turns out, the $20 million

11:39.178 --> 11:42.812
is the highest bail anyone's ever received

11:42.814 --> 11:46.886
for, uh, one count of
murder in the United States.

11:51.022 --> 11:55.958
As time went on, I... I realized
I needed to become proactive.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.128
You cannot just wait and
hope it's gonna work out.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.962
You've got to get involved in it.

11:59.964 --> 12:03.232
You need to find out everything
you can as fast as you can.

12:03.234 --> 12:06.202
In December of 2004,

12:06.204 --> 12:10.072
I end up with, uh, 11
boxes of the discovery.

12:10.074 --> 12:15.077
Discovery is all the information
the police have gathered.

12:15.079 --> 12:18.916
In this particular case, it
was crime-scene photographs,

12:18.918 --> 12:22.919
uh, crime-scene videos,
numerous police reports,

12:22.921 --> 12:27.591
uh, the results of
fingerprints, uh, hair analysis,

12:27.593 --> 12:30.961
blood analysis, and
it's so that the accused

12:30.963 --> 12:33.096
has a chance to defend themselves,

12:33.098 --> 12:35.698
and so, uh, by law,
they're supposed to receive

12:35.700 --> 12:38.100
the discovery so that they can address

12:38.102 --> 12:41.440
what items are being used against them.

12:45.678 --> 12:48.077
Man: What a day in Columbia's
trial of the century.

12:48.079 --> 12:51.114
Erin Moriarty: On October 17, 2005...

12:51.116 --> 12:52.849
Bill: Yeah. I think our hearts are beating

12:52.851 --> 12:54.116
pretty... pretty fast right now.

12:54.118 --> 12:56.919
Moriarty: nearly 4 years
after Kent Heitholt's death,

12:56.921 --> 13:01.026
Ryan Ferguson is the first to stand trial.

13:09.734 --> 13:11.735
Bill, voice-over: When
we go into the trial,

13:11.737 --> 13:13.703
we know there is no physical evidence.

13:13.705 --> 13:17.106
We also had the video of Detective Short

13:17.108 --> 13:20.043
spoon-feeding Erickson
all the information.

13:20.045 --> 13:23.647
Erickson didn't have
any original information.

13:23.649 --> 13:26.015
The evidence in this case will be

13:26.017 --> 13:29.919
that on October 31, 2001...

13:29.921 --> 13:33.889
that's Halloween 2001...

13:33.891 --> 13:37.827
Charles... he goes by Chuck... Erickson

13:37.829 --> 13:42.732
and the defendant Ryan Ferguson,

13:42.734 --> 13:46.102
both 17-year-old
high-school students,

13:46.104 --> 13:49.706
saw a man on the parking lot

13:49.708 --> 13:54.179
of the "Columbia Daily
Tribune" newspaper building.

13:55.314 --> 14:00.049
Without warning, they attacked this man.

14:00.051 --> 14:03.754
The evidence will be that Erickson

14:03.756 --> 14:06.355
walked up and struck the victim

14:06.357 --> 14:10.793
in the head with a tire tool.

14:10.795 --> 14:14.130
Thereafter, the defendant

14:14.132 --> 14:16.799
strangled the victim to death.

14:16.801 --> 14:19.068
Bill, voice-over: He told the
jury at the very beginning,

14:19.070 --> 14:20.870
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

14:20.872 --> 14:23.840
"there will be no physical evidence

14:23.842 --> 14:27.309
"to... to connect Ryan
Ferguson to this crime,

14:27.311 --> 14:30.714
"but we don't need that to get a conviction

14:30.716 --> 14:32.818
because we have a eyewitness."

14:42.361 --> 14:44.727
Roper: Would you raise
your right hand, please?

14:44.729 --> 14:46.763
Do you swear the testimony
you will give in this matter

14:46.765 --> 14:49.066
be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

14:49.068 --> 14:50.833
- so help you God?
- I do.

14:50.835 --> 14:53.872
Would you take the witness stand, please?

14:58.376 --> 15:01.244
Erickson: On the second
anniversary of the murder,

15:01.246 --> 15:04.081
they had something in
the newspaper about it,

15:04.083 --> 15:05.981
and they talked about it,
and they talk about this man

15:05.983 --> 15:08.719
and his life and... and what he'd done.

15:08.721 --> 15:10.754
They talked about the
murder, and they... they had

15:10.756 --> 15:12.889
composite sketches, and I started

15:12.891 --> 15:15.258
to think about that night, and before that,

15:15.260 --> 15:18.227
there were some memories that...

15:18.229 --> 15:20.096
that I knew that they were significant,

15:20.098 --> 15:21.798
but they were just, like, snapshots

15:21.800 --> 15:23.265
like you pause a movie.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.101
Crane: Like, what... what's a snapshot?

15:25.103 --> 15:28.171
For instance, a snapshot was when I...

15:28.173 --> 15:29.339
I remember I saw Dallas.

15:29.341 --> 15:31.874
I remember seeing Dallas
at the intersection.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.143
I don't remember what I said to him.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.845
Something just clicked in my mind

15:34.847 --> 15:35.812
whenever I thought about that.

15:35.814 --> 15:37.081
I might be driving down Providence

15:37.083 --> 15:39.482
and driving by the
intersection and thinking about,

15:39.484 --> 15:43.120
"Well, I saw Dallas there, but
what... why is this important?

15:43.122 --> 15:44.855
Why is this relevant to me now?"

15:44.857 --> 15:47.256
Crane: And there's things
that you've remembered

15:47.258 --> 15:49.024
that have come back to you

15:49.026 --> 15:50.527
since you talked to the police.

15:50.529 --> 15:51.794
Yes. That's correct.

15:51.796 --> 15:53.163
Moriarty, voice-over: When
we first started on this,

15:53.165 --> 15:55.932
you know, we didn't know whether
he was innocent or guilty.

15:55.934 --> 15:58.168
We thought it was a fabulous story

15:58.170 --> 16:01.937
because of the very
provocative police interview

16:01.939 --> 16:05.174
with Charles Erickson
that seemed to indicate

16:05.176 --> 16:07.043
that he knew nothing about the case,

16:07.045 --> 16:08.378
and then when I get to the trial,

16:08.380 --> 16:10.780
I see him on the stand, and he's suddenly

16:10.782 --> 16:14.049
this polished, expert witness.

16:14.051 --> 16:15.184
And I hit him.

16:15.186 --> 16:16.820
You hit him just like that?

16:16.822 --> 16:18.120
Well, I hit him harder than that.

16:18.122 --> 16:19.121
How'd you hit him?

16:19.123 --> 16:21.323
Like... like that,

16:21.325 --> 16:24.461
and he turned right after
I hit him the first time,

16:24.463 --> 16:26.897
and he put his hands up.

16:26.899 --> 16:27.998
I kept hitting him.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.865
And how did you do it?

16:29.867 --> 16:32.369
Just... just like this,

16:32.371 --> 16:33.570
only faster.

16:33.572 --> 16:36.339
Erickson: I saw a lady,
and I saw from the door

16:36.341 --> 16:39.408
that she came out of,
there was a light on inside.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.110
I was really upset.

16:41.112 --> 16:43.078
I was almost on the verge
of tears when I yelled.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.212
Crane: What did you yell?

16:44.214 --> 16:47.216
I yelled... I yelled...
I yelled, "Go get help.

16:47.218 --> 16:48.918
This man needs help."

16:48.920 --> 16:50.253
What happened next?

16:50.255 --> 16:53.322
I... I came around to Ryan's right

16:53.324 --> 16:56.058
from behind him and to his right,

16:56.060 --> 16:58.394
and he was down here, and he had a belt,

16:58.396 --> 17:00.163
and he had his... and he had his foot

17:00.165 --> 17:02.365
on his back, on the victim's back,

17:02.367 --> 17:05.233
and he was pulling him up on the belt.

17:05.236 --> 17:06.868
Crane: You know, I told you before

17:06.871 --> 17:08.838
I had no interest in putting anybody

17:08.839 --> 17:11.007
that didn't do it in jail.

17:11.009 --> 17:12.142
Yes. You did.

17:12.144 --> 17:14.144
I guess it's never too late.

17:14.146 --> 17:18.048
Tell us now if it was all a dream.

17:18.050 --> 17:20.983
I did this. He did this.

17:20.984 --> 17:22.519
I didn't dream anything.

17:22.521 --> 17:25.121
Why...

17:25.123 --> 17:26.454
did you plead guilty?

17:26.457 --> 17:27.589
Because I am guilty.

17:27.590 --> 17:29.526
Rogers: Objection, Your
Honor... self-serving.

17:29.528 --> 17:32.162
Roper: The objection...
the objection is overruled.

17:32.164 --> 17:34.230
You may answer the question.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.066
Because I am guilty.

17:36.068 --> 17:38.934
I'm 100% certain that me and Ryan Ferguson

17:38.936 --> 17:40.537
committed this crime.

17:40.539 --> 17:43.205
Crane: And when you pled guilty, sir,

17:43.207 --> 17:46.242
what was your level of certainty

17:46.244 --> 17:48.310
about your involvement

17:48.312 --> 17:50.547
and Ryan Ferguson's
involvement in this murder?

17:50.549 --> 17:52.315
It was 100%.

17:52.317 --> 17:55.421
Your witness. I don't
have any other questions.

17:59.523 --> 18:02.558
Roper: Defense counsel may inquire.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.560
Bill, voice-over: Charlie
Rogers came from one of the best

18:04.562 --> 18:06.296
law firms in... in Missouri.

18:06.298 --> 18:08.397
Rogers: You were not consciously lying

18:08.399 --> 18:11.000
to Detective Short when you said

18:11.002 --> 18:14.069
you didn't really remember

18:14.071 --> 18:16.906
the murder, were you?

18:16.908 --> 18:19.009
The best way to explain it...

18:19.011 --> 18:21.211
Excuse me. Did you hear the question?

18:21.213 --> 18:22.345
I don't know.

18:22.347 --> 18:24.280
Uh, it's hard to explain
because I always had

18:24.282 --> 18:26.048
the memories, and they were always there.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.150
Let me ask another question.

18:27.152 --> 18:28.919
Crane: Just doesn't he get an opportunity

18:28.921 --> 18:30.019
to complete his answer?

18:30.021 --> 18:31.320
He doesn't get an opportunity

18:31.322 --> 18:32.422
to make speeches that are
not responsive, Your Honor.

18:32.424 --> 18:34.124
I'm trying to respond, but he won't let me.

18:34.126 --> 18:35.459
Roper: Excuse me. Pardon me.

18:35.461 --> 18:38.260
Mr. Erickson, when the attorneys
are discussing a matter,

18:38.262 --> 18:40.297
we don't need a third party, OK?

18:40.299 --> 18:42.434
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

18:48.339 --> 18:50.275
Rogers: Mr. Erickson...

18:54.646 --> 18:57.547
[Papers rustle]

18:57.549 --> 18:59.449
Bill, voice-over: He would start talking,

18:59.451 --> 19:02.188
and he would go, "And another point..."

19:04.623 --> 19:05.788
"is..."

19:05.790 --> 19:09.259
Everybody in the entire
courtroom was like...

19:09.261 --> 19:10.961
and then he'd... he'd go on.

19:10.963 --> 19:13.063
I mean, it was painful.

19:13.065 --> 19:15.901
[Papers rustle]

19:21.606 --> 19:23.943
[Man coughs]

19:25.978 --> 19:28.345
Rogers: You told Detective Short

19:28.347 --> 19:30.246
that you thought Ryan

19:30.248 --> 19:32.248
had strangled Heitholt with a shirt.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.115
Is that correct?

19:33.117 --> 19:33.982
Erickson: I said I didn't...

19:33.984 --> 19:34.983
I... I didn't know what it was.

19:34.985 --> 19:36.685
I thought it might have been a shirt.

19:36.687 --> 19:39.021
OK, and he said,

19:39.023 --> 19:41.257
"Well, I know it wasn't
a shirt," didn't he?

19:41.259 --> 19:42.357
Yes. He did.

19:42.359 --> 19:44.661
Because it certainly never occurred to you

19:44.663 --> 19:46.096
that it might be a belt.

19:46.098 --> 19:47.263
That's correct.

19:47.265 --> 19:53.068
In fact, when Short
told you it was the belt,

19:53.070 --> 19:56.271
you were incredulous, weren't you?

19:56.273 --> 19:57.774
I... I'm not sure.

19:57.776 --> 20:02.248
Would you, uh, Mr. Ross,
play the, uh, segment?

20:04.482 --> 20:06.383
Short: We know it wasn't a shirt.

20:06.385 --> 20:07.784
We know for a fact that his belt

20:07.786 --> 20:08.751
was ripped off of his pants

20:08.753 --> 20:10.319
and he was strangled with his belt.

20:10.321 --> 20:11.688
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:11.690 --> 20:13.423
Bill, voice-over: In reference
to the interrogation tapes,

20:13.425 --> 20:15.325
we wanted them played.

20:15.327 --> 20:17.192
We wanted them played in their entirety

20:17.194 --> 20:21.397
because that... that shows that
Erickson was being spoon-fed.

20:21.399 --> 20:25.370
Man: Uh, over here, um, it's...

20:32.043 --> 20:33.710
Bill, voice-over: The
audiovisuals of the court

20:33.712 --> 20:35.577
were horrible, so you couldn't hear it,

20:35.579 --> 20:37.683
and you couldn't see it.

20:43.454 --> 20:47.723
Rogers used a aerial
photograph of the downtown area.

20:47.725 --> 20:51.227
Now, we told Rogers that we would be happy

20:51.229 --> 20:53.462
to label the map for him that he had,

20:53.464 --> 20:54.596
that we would label it for him.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.365
He'd go, "Oh, no, no. I'll take care of it.

20:56.367 --> 20:58.233
I'll... I'll... I'll label it."

20:58.235 --> 21:01.671
OK, so then the map is used as an exhibit,

21:01.673 --> 21:05.141
but the map was wrong, and he
didn't know where anything was

21:05.143 --> 21:08.744
because... guess what...
Charles Rogers... our attorney,

21:08.746 --> 21:12.582
our esteemed attorney...
never walked the crime scene.

21:12.584 --> 21:18.121
Crane: You labeled
another building George's

21:18.123 --> 21:20.557
and had that wrong, marked wrong,

21:20.559 --> 21:24.359
on your exhibit all this time.

21:24.361 --> 21:25.862
Rogers: All this time, and I'm now about

21:25.864 --> 21:28.364
to change it if I can,
and I have now removed

21:28.366 --> 21:30.133
the label that says, "By George,"

21:30.135 --> 21:32.371
from the wrong place...

21:34.572 --> 21:39.241
and I'm going to put it on the right place.

21:39.243 --> 21:42.511
Roper: Mr. Crane, I think you
may be blocking someone's view.

21:42.513 --> 21:44.780
Judge, can... can I block their view

21:44.782 --> 21:46.115
just for a minute here?

21:46.117 --> 21:47.150
Because I'm having trouble

21:47.152 --> 21:48.151
seeing this thing.

21:48.153 --> 21:51.554
There is no diner on this photograph

21:51.556 --> 21:53.756
that they've been showing this witness,

21:53.758 --> 21:56.859
that back when this photograph was taken...

21:56.861 --> 21:59.561
and I admit this is from having the benefit

21:59.563 --> 22:02.231
of living here in Columbia...

22:02.233 --> 22:06.269
the diner was up the street

22:06.271 --> 22:09.305
around the corner,

22:09.307 --> 22:12.608
and then they moved it later

22:12.610 --> 22:15.912
to the location that's accurately portrayed

22:15.914 --> 22:18.681
on the State's exhibit 9,

22:18.683 --> 22:24.554
which was where it was on November 1, 2001.

22:24.556 --> 22:27.190
Is there an objection
that you have, Mr. Crane?

22:27.192 --> 22:28.724
Well, I just was making a record that

22:28.726 --> 22:31.260
he's asking the question about a diner,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.163
and there isn't one on here...

22:33.165 --> 22:34.096
OK. Well, I...

22:34.098 --> 22:35.097
and I appreciate the correction.

22:35.099 --> 22:37.599
so the objection is, that's improper.

22:37.601 --> 22:40.269
It was absolutely shocking.

22:40.271 --> 22:44.307
I, uh...

22:44.309 --> 22:46.175
That was a bad moment.

22:46.177 --> 22:49.578
I... I kept saying, "How are
we gonna recover from this?"

22:49.580 --> 22:51.681
Yeah. I'm looking over
at Ryan, and Ryan's, like,

22:51.683 --> 22:53.849
looking straight ahead like, "Oh, my gosh,

22:53.851 --> 22:57.422
this is our attorney that
we paid all this money for?"

23:02.394 --> 23:06.962
Crane: Good afternoon.
You doing OK? You nervous?

23:06.964 --> 23:09.766
Bill, voice-over: When Crane
calls Shawna Ornt as a witness...

23:09.768 --> 23:11.467
he had to call her...

23:11.469 --> 23:14.604
she was the only witness who actually drew

23:14.606 --> 23:16.573
not only one composite.

23:16.575 --> 23:18.607
She drew two composites.

23:18.609 --> 23:20.509
Crane: First of all, what is it?

23:20.511 --> 23:21.911
It's a composite I did.

23:21.913 --> 23:23.413
A composite?

23:23.415 --> 23:25.647
You did this with, um, a detective

23:25.649 --> 23:27.249
at the Columbia Police Department?

23:27.251 --> 23:28.384
Yes.

23:28.386 --> 23:30.720
And this was not too long after

23:30.722 --> 23:33.623
the events that you
just described, correct?

23:33.625 --> 23:35.057
- It was the next day.
- OK.

23:35.059 --> 23:37.993
Bill, voice-over: Here's Ryan
sitting, like, 20 feet from her.

23:37.995 --> 23:41.364
Crane could've said, which
most prosecutors would've said,

23:41.366 --> 23:43.499
"So can you identify the person

23:43.501 --> 23:45.768
that was the perpetrator of that crime?"

23:45.770 --> 23:47.670
and if she would've said yes, he goes,

23:47.672 --> 23:49.471
"Is that person in the courtroom?

23:49.473 --> 23:50.772
Can you identify the person?"

23:50.774 --> 23:54.243
He asked every question
under the sun except that one.

23:54.245 --> 23:58.615
Then it's our turn, so, uh,
Rogers was afraid to ask her

23:58.617 --> 24:00.650
because he didn't know
what she was gonna say,

24:00.652 --> 24:02.652
so here you've got the only person

24:02.654 --> 24:05.654
that could identify the
person in the parking lot

24:05.656 --> 24:07.624
at the time of... of the murder.

24:07.626 --> 24:09.625
Neither the defense or the prosecution

24:09.627 --> 24:12.497
would ask her what she saw.

24:20.038 --> 24:21.703
Roper: You may inquire.

24:21.705 --> 24:23.306
Crane: Give us your name, please.

24:23.308 --> 24:25.540
Jerry Trump.

24:25.542 --> 24:29.846
Uh, back in October, uh, of 2001,

24:29.848 --> 24:32.615
what was one of the places that you clean?

24:32.617 --> 24:34.717
Uh, the "Columbia Daily Tribune."

24:34.719 --> 24:37.353
How long had you been a
janitor there by that time?

24:37.355 --> 24:39.689
Believe it was about 6 months.

24:39.691 --> 24:42.491
Bill, voice-over: When
Jerry Trump took the stand

24:42.493 --> 24:45.361
day 3 of the trial, Crane did introduce him

24:45.363 --> 24:47.829
as a person who was a child molester,

24:47.831 --> 24:51.667
had served time in prison,
but had witness testimony

24:51.669 --> 24:54.002
that would be vital to this case,

24:54.004 --> 24:56.005
and then he went into it, what he had seen.

24:56.007 --> 24:58.641
Trump: I hollered, "Who's out there?"

24:58.643 --> 25:01.810
and with that, two young men

25:01.812 --> 25:06.449
raised up from behind their car and said,

25:06.451 --> 25:08.451
"Someone's hurt out here, man."

25:08.453 --> 25:09.818
One of them said that.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.854
Crane: What about their race?

25:11.856 --> 25:13.623
They were white.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.692
Can you give them an age category?

25:15.694 --> 25:17.492
I thought that were between

25:17.494 --> 25:19.729
the ages of 19, 20.

25:19.731 --> 25:23.598
OK. What did you tell me you'd received

25:23.600 --> 25:26.568
while you were incarcerated?

25:26.570 --> 25:29.705
When...

25:29.707 --> 25:31.874
it was printed in the paper that

25:31.876 --> 25:35.744
somebody had confessed to the murder

25:35.746 --> 25:38.614
and named another individual,

25:38.616 --> 25:41.750
my wife sent me a copy of that article

25:41.752 --> 25:43.920
from the "Columbia Daily Tribune,"

25:43.922 --> 25:46.888
and I didn't know she was sending that,

25:46.890 --> 25:51.059
and opening my mail, I first turned

25:51.061 --> 25:53.596
to the two pictures,

25:53.598 --> 25:55.832
and... and my mouth dropped.

25:55.834 --> 25:57.767
I didn't see the headlines or anything

25:57.769 --> 25:58.867
because I recognized...

25:58.869 --> 26:00.803
How did you first turn to the two pictures?

26:00.805 --> 26:02.637
Yeah, but that's just the way it was folded

26:02.639 --> 26:03.838
in the envelope.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.743
When you saw those, do
you see in the courtroom

26:07.745 --> 26:12.115
here today one of the individuals

26:12.117 --> 26:16.685
that you saw at Mr. Heitholt's vehicle

26:16.687 --> 26:20.155
on the early-morning
hours of November 1, 2001?

26:20.157 --> 26:22.724
Yes. I do.

26:22.726 --> 26:24.426
Could you point him out for us, please?

26:24.428 --> 26:25.730
The defendant.

26:26.998 --> 26:29.766
Moriarty, voice-over: He
came across very credibly,

26:29.768 --> 26:32.902
even though I know that he
has a... a criminal background.

26:32.904 --> 26:35.771
It was an important moment in that trial.

26:35.773 --> 26:38.042
Roper: Mr. Ferguson,
would you come forward?

26:40.878 --> 26:43.779
Are you aware that you
have a constitutional right

26:43.781 --> 26:45.981
to testify if you and counsel believe

26:45.983 --> 26:47.916
that that's in your best interest?

26:47.918 --> 26:49.184
Yes.

26:49.186 --> 26:51.153
Bill, voice-over: My
feeling, uh, once I discovered

26:51.155 --> 26:54.423
that Ryan was gonna be
called as a witness was,

26:54.425 --> 26:57.859
"Oh, my God, this confirms

26:57.861 --> 27:02.765
in my mind my worst fear that
we're gonna lose this case."

27:02.767 --> 27:06.568
I... I get to talk to
Ryan just before he goes up

27:06.570 --> 27:11.039
and realize he's not even
been prepared to be a witness.

27:11.041 --> 27:13.976
When you go through and
you look at murder cases,

27:13.978 --> 27:16.913
it is rare, almost unheard of,

27:16.915 --> 27:19.749
to put the accused on the witness stand.

27:19.751 --> 27:22.151
You only do that in a desperate situation.

27:22.153 --> 27:24.053
This is your Hail Mary.

27:24.055 --> 27:26.221
Uh, they told me that I was being arrested

27:26.223 --> 27:28.024
for a homicide, and...

27:28.026 --> 27:29.459
Kathryn Benson: What went through your mind

27:29.461 --> 27:30.826
at that point?

27:30.828 --> 27:33.762
I mean, I knew I had never hurt anyone,

27:33.764 --> 27:36.699
so I wasn't really too worried about it.

27:36.701 --> 27:38.099
Moriarty, voice-over: Ryan Ferguson,

27:38.101 --> 27:42.672
who took the stand, did not...
did not show a lot of passion.

27:42.674 --> 27:44.874
Crane: I believe you testified on direct

27:44.876 --> 27:47.542
you thought Chuck was an odd man.

27:47.544 --> 27:49.846
Yes.

27:49.848 --> 27:52.748
You think that's funny?

27:52.750 --> 27:54.584
I think he's an odd man. Yes.

27:54.586 --> 27:56.685
You think that's funny?

27:56.687 --> 27:58.721
- It's not funny.
- OK.

27:58.723 --> 27:59.821
I just thought you were smiling.

27:59.823 --> 28:00.823
I've seen him do...

28:00.825 --> 28:01.691
I thought you thought it was funny.

28:01.693 --> 28:02.657
No. It was not a funny laugh.

28:02.659 --> 28:03.558
OK. Well, I mean, this is America.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.728
If you want to laugh, you can.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.096
That was not a laugh.

28:07.098 --> 28:08.297
Bill, voice-over: I just felt
Crane was beating up on him,

28:08.299 --> 28:10.967
taking advantage of him,
and just hammering away

28:10.969 --> 28:12.201
at nothing, just hammering away, hammering,

28:12.203 --> 28:15.104
and he was trying to get
Ryan to lose his temper.

28:15.106 --> 28:18.207
He was saying and doing
everything he could possibly do

28:18.209 --> 28:20.977
to get Ryan to lose
control, to lose his temper,

28:20.979 --> 28:22.878
and Ryan wouldn't do it.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.814
I was... I was pretty upset over that,

28:24.816 --> 28:26.781
and I said, "He is a bully."

28:26.783 --> 28:28.917
He is a bully, and that's my son,

28:28.919 --> 28:30.920
and I take that personally.

28:30.922 --> 28:32.755
I never thought I'd be arrested

28:32.757 --> 28:34.056
for a crime I didn't commit.

28:34.058 --> 28:35.057
Would you?

28:35.059 --> 28:35.958
Would you believe you'd be arrested

28:35.960 --> 28:37.894
for a crime you didn't commit?

28:37.896 --> 28:39.595
I didn't commit one.

28:39.597 --> 28:41.663
Neither did I.

28:41.665 --> 28:44.066
Ryan...

28:44.068 --> 28:47.936
Roper: Uh, does the State
intend to call rebuttal evidence?

28:47.938 --> 28:49.305
Crane: No rebuttal, Judge.

28:49.307 --> 28:52.974
Ladies and gentlemen, the
evidence in this case is closed.

28:52.976 --> 28:56.112
The exhibits that have
been admitted into evidence,

28:56.114 --> 28:59.214
most of them are available
for you to take back

28:59.216 --> 29:01.083
into your, uh, room.

29:01.085 --> 29:04.189
You may begin your deliberations.

29:10.828 --> 29:13.828
Announcer: This is "KOMU News at Six."

29:13.830 --> 29:18.233
You know what the truth is...

29:18.235 --> 29:20.102
guilty.

29:20.104 --> 29:24.105
Woman: The jury's out in the
murder trial of Ryan Ferguson.

29:24.107 --> 29:26.576
KOMU's Travis Thompson joins us now live

29:26.578 --> 29:27.844
from the Boone County Courthouse.

29:27.846 --> 29:30.846
Travis, the jury's been
out for about two hours now.

29:30.848 --> 29:32.981
Any work yet on when a verdict might come?

29:32.983 --> 29:35.750
Well, the verdict could
come sometime tonight.

29:35.752 --> 29:37.953
The jury is deliberating right now

29:37.955 --> 29:40.021
after the prosecutor and defense attorney

29:40.023 --> 29:42.857
shouted fierce words at the jury.

29:42.859 --> 29:46.862
The assault as described
by Charles Erickson

29:46.864 --> 29:51.366
is not borne out by the physical evidence.

29:51.368 --> 29:54.804
Ryan Ferguson held that
belt and jerked it up

29:54.806 --> 29:58.140
and held it there long enough to
break his neck and strangle him.

29:58.142 --> 30:00.276
We will be here as the verdict comes down,

30:00.278 --> 30:02.278
and we'll have that when it happens.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.482
Back to you.

30:10.053 --> 30:13.925
Bill, voice-over: I was
feeling very apprehensive.

30:17.628 --> 30:20.261
Roper: Madam foreman, has
the jury reached verdicts

30:20.263 --> 30:22.064
on both the counts submitted to you?

30:22.066 --> 30:23.365
Woman: Yes. We have.

30:23.367 --> 30:25.768
If you would give those
together with the instructions

30:25.770 --> 30:28.173
to our marshal, will you, please?

30:32.175 --> 30:33.107
[Clears throat]

30:33.109 --> 30:35.778
"As to count one, we, the jury,

30:35.780 --> 30:38.213
"find the defendant Ryan William Ferguson

30:38.215 --> 30:40.715
"uh, guilty of murder in the second degree

30:40.717 --> 30:43.051
as submitted in instruction number 11."

30:43.053 --> 30:45.020
Uh, madam foreman, is this the verdict

30:45.022 --> 30:47.656
of the jury on count one?

30:47.658 --> 30:49.892
Woman: It is.

30:49.894 --> 30:51.826
"As to count two, we, the jury,

30:51.828 --> 30:53.929
"find the defendant Ryan William Ferguson

30:53.931 --> 30:55.865
"guilty of robbery in the first degree

30:55.867 --> 30:58.933
as submitted in instruction number 13."

30:58.935 --> 31:01.336
Madam foreman, is this
the verdict of the jury

31:01.338 --> 31:02.971
with respect to count two?

31:02.973 --> 31:04.105
Woman: Yes. It is.

31:04.107 --> 31:06.409
You have found the
defendant guilty of murder

31:06.411 --> 31:09.077
in the second degree and
robbery in the first degree.

31:09.079 --> 31:11.446
At this stage of the
trial, it will be your duty

31:11.448 --> 31:14.349
to determine within the
limits prescribed by law

31:14.351 --> 31:18.086
the punishment that must be
imposed for those offenses.

31:18.088 --> 31:21.022
Bill, voice-over: When Ryan
first heard the verdict,

31:21.024 --> 31:24.826
I was looking at him, and
he was just shell-shocked.

31:24.828 --> 31:27.195
I think he was just numb, just numb,

31:27.197 --> 31:31.834
and, uh... and he started
crying, you know...

31:31.836 --> 31:34.002
how could you not?...

31:34.004 --> 31:36.872
and we were all crying.

31:36.874 --> 31:39.243
It was terrible.

31:46.818 --> 31:51.252
Once they found him guilty,
then they asked family members

31:51.254 --> 31:53.255
if we'd like to come
up and make a statement.

31:53.257 --> 31:54.957
Rogers: Tell us your name, please.

31:54.959 --> 31:56.325
Bill Ferguson.

31:56.327 --> 31:59.394
And what's your relationship to Ryan?

31:59.396 --> 32:01.396
He's my son,

32:01.398 --> 32:04.866
and I'm totally convinced
that he is innocent.

32:04.868 --> 32:06.969
And have you done what you could

32:06.971 --> 32:10.005
do try and demonstrate Ryan's innocence?

32:10.007 --> 32:11.973
You know, um, I thought

32:11.975 --> 32:14.143
up to a few minutes ago I had,

32:14.145 --> 32:16.010
but apparently, I...

32:16.012 --> 32:19.013
obviously since I'm a amateur at this,

32:19.015 --> 32:21.049
I'm gonna learn a lot more about this,

32:21.051 --> 32:23.118
and I'm gonna prove my son's innocence,

32:23.120 --> 32:25.153
and so will my family.

32:25.155 --> 32:29.224
It's gonna be really very difficult,

32:29.226 --> 32:31.426
and if he gets the jail sentence

32:31.428 --> 32:34.430
that I'm hearing, I will never live

32:34.432 --> 32:39.167
long enough to see him outside jail.

32:39.169 --> 32:42.371
I was there when he was born.

32:42.373 --> 32:43.806
[Sighs]

32:43.808 --> 32:45.974
I was right there when he was born,

32:45.976 --> 32:49.444
and, um, if he goes to jail

32:49.446 --> 32:51.180
the time that we're talking about,

32:51.182 --> 32:54.249
I'm never gonna see my son again.

32:54.251 --> 32:57.787
Bill, voice-over: I was just
on, uh, adrenaline at that point.

32:57.789 --> 33:00.088
I don't even know what I said.

33:00.090 --> 33:03.092
I was just speaking from the heart.

33:03.094 --> 33:04.929
I don't know.

33:08.265 --> 33:10.965
Roper: "We, the jury,
having found defendant

33:10.967 --> 33:14.403
"Ryan William Ferguson guilty
of murder in the second degree,

33:14.405 --> 33:16.971
"assess and declare the
punishment for murder

33:16.973 --> 33:19.107
"in the second degree at imprisonment

33:19.109 --> 33:21.477
"for a term of 30 years.

33:21.479 --> 33:24.512
"As to count two, we, the
jury, having found defendant

33:24.514 --> 33:28.116
"Ryan William Ferguson guilty
of robbery in the first degree,

33:28.118 --> 33:30.486
"assess and declare the
punishment for robbery

33:30.488 --> 33:32.954
"in the first degree at imprisonment

33:32.956 --> 33:35.089
for a term of 10 years."

33:35.091 --> 33:37.358
Bill, voice-over: To
actually hear it and knowing

33:37.360 --> 33:40.328
that he would be spending
many, many, many, many years

33:40.330 --> 33:44.499
in prison and there's
nothing I could do about it,

33:44.501 --> 33:47.036
it just swept away.

33:47.038 --> 33:50.138
Just, it was just like, um,

33:50.140 --> 33:53.509
a earthquake or a flood, couldn't stop it.

33:53.511 --> 33:56.345
I've felt like that very
many times in my life.

33:56.347 --> 34:00.382
I can usually find a solution.
I can usually fix things.

34:00.384 --> 34:03.384
Kelly: Love you. We'll get you out.

34:03.386 --> 34:05.187
Love you.

34:05.189 --> 34:06.522
Bill, voice-over: They filed
us out of the courtroom,

34:06.524 --> 34:08.857
and I went out in front, and there were

34:08.859 --> 34:13.228
a tremendous number of reporters
and lights and everything,

34:13.231 --> 34:15.263
and so they go, "What are you
gonna do now, Mr. Ferguson?

34:15.264 --> 34:17.533
What are you gonna do now?"

34:17.534 --> 34:22.270
and I go, "Well, in the
words of John Paul Jones,

34:22.272 --> 34:24.742
we have just begun to fight."

34:32.248 --> 34:37.386
Leslie and I met at the
University of Missouri 1972.

34:37.388 --> 34:41.121
We started seeing each other
and ultimately, uh, graduated,

34:41.123 --> 34:45.795
got married, and decided that
we'd like to travel overseas.

34:47.231 --> 34:49.429
We bought a vehicle in Amsterdam,

34:49.431 --> 34:51.433
and we went as far north as we could go

34:51.435 --> 34:54.235
up to the Arctic Circle,
but then our engine seized,

34:54.237 --> 34:56.437
and, uh, we were on the Arctic Circle,

34:56.438 --> 34:58.339
so I had to get a new engine.

34:58.341 --> 35:00.174
Once we got our vehicle repaired,

35:00.176 --> 35:03.111
we were already $1,300 over budget,

35:03.113 --> 35:06.548
so I got a job working
on a oil rig as a welder,

35:06.550 --> 35:09.183
although, I must confess,
I really wasn't a welder.

35:09.185 --> 35:11.319
I just told them I was a welder,

35:11.321 --> 35:13.288
which is one thing I
learned in the army, is,

35:13.290 --> 35:15.924
you have to improvise and solve the problem

35:15.926 --> 35:17.191
and accomplish the mission,

35:17.193 --> 35:19.863
and the mission was make some money.

35:22.066 --> 35:24.836
We traveled for about a year in Africa.

35:30.207 --> 35:33.308
We knew financially we would be broke

35:33.310 --> 35:35.343
by the time we got to Australia,

35:35.345 --> 35:38.314
and we knew that there
were teaching positions.

35:38.316 --> 35:40.415
All you really need is
a degree in anything,

35:40.417 --> 35:43.419
and they would let you teach
in the Outback of Australia,

35:43.421 --> 35:46.089
so that's what we had planned on doing.

35:51.361 --> 35:55.430
Halfway across, we came
across an aboriginal settlement

35:55.432 --> 35:58.433
called Docker River,
and there we discovered

35:58.435 --> 36:02.240
that they needed, uh, a couple of teachers.

36:05.209 --> 36:08.377
While we were there
teaching, our daughter Kelly

36:08.379 --> 36:11.580
was born in Docker River.

36:11.582 --> 36:15.616
Then we left that position
and went to Alice Springs

36:15.618 --> 36:19.020
and ultimately to the
northern part of Australia,

36:19.022 --> 36:21.859
uh, Nhulunbuy, where Ryan was born.

36:23.593 --> 36:27.529
When Leslie and I started this
trip to go around the world,

36:27.531 --> 36:30.598
we were only planning
to be away for two years,

36:30.600 --> 36:33.267
so it was 10 years and two children later

36:33.269 --> 36:37.006
we come back to Columbia
and to... to start our lives.

36:37.008 --> 36:41.243
You know, I didn't get married
till I was 30 years old,

36:41.245 --> 36:44.312
and I had a lot of time
to think about a family

36:44.314 --> 36:46.548
and how I wanted to be as a father,

36:46.550 --> 36:49.752
so I made up my mind as soon
as Ryan was born that I...

36:49.754 --> 36:52.388
and same way with Kelly
when she was born...

36:52.390 --> 36:55.390
that I was gonna spend a lot
of time with the both of them,

36:55.392 --> 36:58.394
an inordinate amount of time,
and I was going to show them

36:58.396 --> 37:00.462
everything I possibly
could and travel with them

37:00.464 --> 37:02.663
and explain things to them

37:02.665 --> 37:05.767
and just be a big part of their lives,

37:05.769 --> 37:08.272
and so that's what I did.

37:11.042 --> 37:13.508
Leslie: Ryan was just, um...

37:13.510 --> 37:16.477
He was a real easy kid to raise.

37:16.479 --> 37:18.446
You know, Bill and I have commented a lot

37:18.448 --> 37:21.316
that he was just such a
loving child, you know?

37:21.318 --> 37:24.453
He... he would like to just
come and sit on your lap

37:24.455 --> 37:27.589
and be comfortable there.

37:27.591 --> 37:31.727
Bill: Ryan was a very
curious, uh, young man.

37:31.729 --> 37:34.196
He was very fit.

37:34.198 --> 37:36.464
He had the largest calves,

37:36.466 --> 37:39.468
uh, of, uh, any child his age.

37:39.470 --> 37:43.372
He just... he was just
a great physical specimen.

37:43.374 --> 37:46.475
Leslie: And then as he grew older

37:46.477 --> 37:48.310
and he would be around
friends, a lot of times,

37:48.312 --> 37:49.711
they go through a stage where it was like

37:49.713 --> 37:51.580
your parents aren't so cool, you know,

37:51.582 --> 37:53.214
and they don't want to have
anything to do with you anymore,

37:53.216 --> 37:55.484
and Ryan never really went through that.

37:55.486 --> 37:57.453
He would always give us a hug.

37:57.455 --> 37:59.854
A lot of kids at that age wouldn't do that.

37:59.856 --> 38:02.658
Bill: When I would take a trip
in my real estate business, uh,

38:02.660 --> 38:04.759
to go to houses or put signs out,

38:04.761 --> 38:05.995
he would go with me.

38:05.997 --> 38:08.663
Uh, if I wanted to go to
Kansas City or St. Louis,

38:08.665 --> 38:09.865
he would go with me.

38:09.867 --> 38:11.267
Then we started doing
trips across the country,

38:11.269 --> 38:14.102
camping out, doing float trips,
and we just started spending

38:14.104 --> 38:17.573
an inordinate amount of
time together, and, uh...

38:17.575 --> 38:21.980
and so we just developed
this bond as time went on.

38:28.551 --> 38:30.252
- Bill: Yeah.
- All right.

38:30.254 --> 38:31.053
Hey, man.

38:31.055 --> 38:32.321
What you know about it?

38:32.323 --> 38:33.622
- Hey, man.
- Fuckin' "A."

38:33.624 --> 38:36.558
Whoo! That was the shit. It was the shit.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.292
Let's go back and do it again.

38:38.294 --> 38:40.395
- Ha ha!
- Oh...

38:40.397 --> 38:42.600
All right. Good.

38:44.801 --> 38:45.968
I know.

38:45.970 --> 38:46.935
Leslie, voice-over:
When you look at the past

38:46.937 --> 38:47.903
that Bill and I have had together

38:47.905 --> 38:50.404
and all the things that we've done,

38:50.406 --> 38:54.209
we... we've experienced so
many things together, which...

38:54.211 --> 38:56.645
It makes it even stranger,
really, that we're not together,

38:56.647 --> 38:59.580
but, um, you know, it's...

38:59.582 --> 39:02.783
Life changes, I guess,
as you go through life,

39:02.785 --> 39:07.855
and we will always be
there for our children.

39:07.857 --> 39:09.924
Our children are our common denominator,

39:09.926 --> 39:15.163
and so we will always be
there to support them together.

39:15.165 --> 39:17.732
Prior to Ryan, uh, being arrested,

39:17.734 --> 39:21.169
uh, we had already
separated, uh, as a couple.

39:21.171 --> 39:25.473
His arrest actually, um,
brought us back together again,

39:25.475 --> 39:28.310
uh, but as parents,

39:28.312 --> 39:30.745
uh, not... not as a married couple,

39:30.747 --> 39:33.650
but as parents, uh,
concerned, uh, for their son.

39:35.318 --> 39:37.218
[Horn honks]

39:37.220 --> 39:39.354
Bill, voice-over: After the trial,

39:39.356 --> 39:41.290
I was, like, in a state of shock,

39:41.292 --> 39:43.859
pretty much, that first 24 hours.

39:43.861 --> 39:46.861
I fell asleep, woke up the next day,

39:46.863 --> 39:49.497
and, I remember, it
was a bright, sunny day,

39:49.499 --> 39:53.334
and I'm thinking, "Oh, my gosh, wow.

39:53.336 --> 39:55.470
That really happened?"

39:55.472 --> 39:58.109
and I'm thinking, "I got to get busy."

40:01.345 --> 40:03.645
I started going down to the crime scene,

40:03.647 --> 40:05.546
walking through the crime scene,

40:05.548 --> 40:08.385
walking all around within
3 or 4 blocks every night.

40:12.522 --> 40:14.823
I'd like to go down when the moon was full

40:14.825 --> 40:16.959
because the night that
that crime took place

40:16.961 --> 40:18.060
was a full moon,

40:18.062 --> 40:20.731
and the temperature was about 60 degrees.

40:22.832 --> 40:25.901
I would go down, say,
at 1:00 in the morning

40:25.903 --> 40:27.301
or maybe midnight.

40:27.303 --> 40:29.904
I'd stay there until, like,
maybe 3:30, 4:00 in the morning.

40:29.906 --> 40:33.508
It was just me and a couple of stray cats.

40:33.510 --> 40:36.245
A reporter misquoted
something that Ryan had said,

40:36.247 --> 40:38.714
so I challenged him to come
down and walk the crime scene

40:38.716 --> 40:41.616
with me, and he did, and he filmed it...

40:41.618 --> 40:43.017
Man, voice-over: So he started looking

40:43.019 --> 40:44.620
into Kent Heitholt's murder.

40:44.622 --> 40:46.787
He's walked the crime
scene at least 12 times.

40:46.789 --> 40:48.457
And allegedly, Chuck's saying,

40:48.459 --> 40:49.625
they came through here, and they hit him.

40:49.627 --> 40:51.526
Bill, voice-over: and
then other people said,

40:51.528 --> 40:53.562
"Well, we... we'd like
to see the crime scene,"

40:53.564 --> 40:55.696
and before you know it, I... I'm doing

40:55.698 --> 40:58.000
crime scene tours all the time.

40:58.002 --> 41:01.435
I don't care who it is. I
never refused to take anybody.

41:01.437 --> 41:03.471
It could be one people.
It could be 10 people.

41:03.473 --> 41:07.008
Ashland school brought
two busloads of kids up,

41:07.010 --> 41:10.680
and I took them on the tour.

41:13.816 --> 41:14.883
Ryan, voice-over: You're
looking into the world,

41:14.885 --> 41:16.685
and you can see all the beautiful colors

41:16.687 --> 41:18.953
and all the amazing things going on.

41:18.955 --> 41:21.290
Imagine just putting this
gray film over it all,

41:21.292 --> 41:25.326
kind of like an overcast
day or a drab winter,

41:25.328 --> 41:26.761
and that's how it is in there.

41:26.763 --> 41:30.464
It's just this palpable gray sensation

41:30.466 --> 41:32.901
of everyone's emotions.

41:32.903 --> 41:35.703
You're blind to it until it really hits you

41:35.705 --> 41:38.707
and you realize that, you
know, you're not going anywhere

41:38.709 --> 41:41.812
for a very sustained period
of time and this is life.

41:43.314 --> 41:46.348
Go into your bathroom...
10-by-10-foot bathroom,

41:46.350 --> 41:47.749
which is relatively nice, I guess...

41:47.751 --> 41:51.319
but take out the bathtub
and put a double bunk,

41:51.321 --> 41:56.024
and then, you know, your sink
doesn't have any countertop,

41:56.026 --> 41:58.392
and there's a toilet connected to it,

41:58.394 --> 42:00.328
and then imagine there just being,

42:00.330 --> 42:02.464
like, a desk with a stool.

42:02.466 --> 42:04.799
That is where I live.

42:04.801 --> 42:07.468
That's where I go to sleep.
That's where I wake up.

42:07.470 --> 42:09.638
That's where I lock down to be counted

42:09.640 --> 42:11.605
every afternoon, every night.

42:11.607 --> 42:13.075
I mean, that's it.

42:13.077 --> 42:14.975
Steel door, when it shuts, it's loud.

42:14.977 --> 42:15.977
It's "doosh!"

42:15.979 --> 42:18.580
That lets you know you're locked up.

42:18.582 --> 42:21.950
Throughout the night,
you hear a lot of noises,

42:21.952 --> 42:25.587
the doors in the distance
being slammed shut

42:25.589 --> 42:28.622
over and over again, and you hear the buzz

42:28.624 --> 42:30.859
of the light that will never go off.

42:30.861 --> 42:33.761
You hear people who are losing their minds

42:33.763 --> 42:36.531
and screaming and yelling,
beating on the walls,

42:36.533 --> 42:39.734
the CO's keys as they walk past you.

42:39.736 --> 42:42.404
The worst sounds are the screams of people

42:42.406 --> 42:46.741
who are being beaten or raped,

42:46.743 --> 42:50.479
shoes squeaking on the floors above you

42:50.481 --> 42:55.417
and you know there's a fight,
and everybody gets quiet,

42:55.419 --> 42:57.651
and all you can hear are the squeaks,

42:57.653 --> 43:00.488
and then you just hear
somebody holler out for help,

43:00.490 --> 43:04.459
and it's very strange to hear
somebody screaming for help,

43:04.461 --> 43:08.796
moaning for help, and knowing
that nobody around them

43:08.798 --> 43:12.401
gives a damn and that nobody
is going to push the button

43:12.403 --> 43:16.470
that's gonna bring the CO in to help them.

43:16.472 --> 43:18.540
Those are the noises that probably

43:18.542 --> 43:20.875
will never leave your mind,

43:20.877 --> 43:24.044
the noises that, although
aren't heard every night,

43:24.046 --> 43:27.717
will persist with you every night.

43:33.957 --> 43:36.191
Leslie, voice-over: I feel
like I've been so fortunate

43:36.193 --> 43:39.194
in my life, so there's nothing in my life

43:39.196 --> 43:43.999
that would've ever prepared
me or given me any little clue

43:44.001 --> 43:46.468
that something like this could ever happen.

43:46.470 --> 43:47.903
It totally throws you for a loop.

43:47.905 --> 43:50.872
It's like this can't really be happening,

43:50.874 --> 43:55.776
and when it does, you just...
or it seems like your...

43:55.778 --> 43:58.879
all your energy and effort
is just going into trying

43:58.881 --> 44:01.683
to figure out how you're gonna make it

44:01.685 --> 44:03.051
from one day to the next.

44:03.053 --> 44:05.821
You know, you want to keep
your life as normal as possible

44:05.823 --> 44:09.624
because all this stuff is
going on that's not normal.

44:09.626 --> 44:13.227
With Bill, I think his
way of coping is more,

44:13.229 --> 44:15.997
"OK. I'm gonna do something
about this," you know,

44:15.999 --> 44:18.633
so he's always plotting something

44:18.635 --> 44:22.102
because if he's taking some action,

44:22.104 --> 44:26.743
it makes him feel better
because he's doing something.

44:31.682 --> 44:33.615
Bill, voice-over: Attorneys never want you

44:33.617 --> 44:34.950
to talk to anybody.

44:34.952 --> 44:38.053
All of them would always say,
"Don't contact witnesses,"

44:38.055 --> 44:40.622
and I can see their
point, but I can also see

44:40.624 --> 44:42.524
that when I didn't talk to witnesses,

44:42.526 --> 44:45.060
when I didn't do any work, that
things didn't get done, either,

44:45.062 --> 44:47.895
so we created a webpage,
and I knew sooner or later,

44:47.897 --> 44:50.499
that some people that would
know something about the crime

44:50.501 --> 44:52.167
would start blogging,

44:52.169 --> 44:54.502
they would start putting
information in there,

44:54.504 --> 44:56.171
and then one day, one person said,

44:56.173 --> 44:59.107
"I have some information
I'd like to share with you,"

44:59.109 --> 45:02.042
and ultimately, we discovered
that was Shawna Ornt,

45:02.044 --> 45:06.915
the only person that had actually seen

45:06.917 --> 45:09.884
the alleged perpetrator of the crime

45:09.886 --> 45:13.053
and had drawn two composites.

45:13.055 --> 45:15.589
She agreed to meet me in the parking lot

45:15.591 --> 45:19.294
where the crime had taken
place, uh, in the late afternoon.

45:19.296 --> 45:22.531
I said, "If you would
feel more comfortable, uh,

45:22.533 --> 45:24.198
"bringing your husband or friends,

45:24.200 --> 45:26.133
you certainly are welcome to do that."

45:26.135 --> 45:28.937
I had no idea how that
conversation would go.

45:28.939 --> 45:31.939
Uh, it really would be my,
really, first interview.

45:31.941 --> 45:33.607
So you haven't been back here since

45:33.609 --> 45:35.176
the crime took place, have you?

45:35.178 --> 45:36.176
So how do you feel?

45:36.178 --> 45:38.879
Um, OK, better than what I thought.

45:38.881 --> 45:40.649
OK. Well, it's not dark,
so that's a good thing.

45:40.651 --> 45:41.950
- Yep.
- OK.

45:41.952 --> 45:43.817
Bill, voice-over: I mean,
that was a scary time for me

45:43.819 --> 45:46.620
because I'm on video, I'm talking to her,

45:46.622 --> 45:48.656
I have not asked her the main question.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.158
The main thing I wanted to ask her was,

45:50.160 --> 45:52.560
"Was it or was it not Ryan Ferguson?"

45:52.562 --> 45:53.861
because no one's ever asked her.

45:53.863 --> 45:55.696
But now, you got a good look at the guy

45:55.698 --> 45:56.765
that was looking at you face to face.

45:56.767 --> 45:58.700
Oh, most definitely. I was, like, froze.

45:58.702 --> 45:59.834
Really? And you're looking right at him.

45:59.836 --> 46:01.569
Yeah. I'm like...

46:01.571 --> 46:02.970
OK. Well, let me ask you this.

46:02.972 --> 46:06.140
So... so he's looking right in your face,

46:06.142 --> 46:08.176
and you got a good look at his face,

46:08.178 --> 46:11.345
and... and when you were in... in court,

46:11.347 --> 46:13.850
you had a good look at
Ryan's face, I would assume.

46:15.852 --> 46:18.285
OK, and you absolutely would say 100%

46:18.287 --> 46:20.757
that that was not Ryan
Ferguson you saw there.

46:24.827 --> 46:25.995
- or... yeah, Erickson.
- Yeah.

46:29.932 --> 46:32.667
So then I said, "So what
was your relationship

46:32.669 --> 46:34.905
with Prosecutor Crane?"

46:38.307 --> 46:40.543
And what was his response?

46:48.785 --> 46:49.817
No. That's OK.

46:49.819 --> 46:51.488
You know...

46:53.356 --> 46:55.756
Yeah.

46:55.758 --> 46:56.991
Right, right.

46:56.993 --> 46:58.192
Bill, voice-over: At the
time, she was only, like,

46:58.194 --> 46:59.394
19 or 20 years old, and
she was very intimidated

46:59.396 --> 47:02.296
by the whole process,
and... and Prosecutor Crane

47:02.298 --> 47:04.866
had... had literally scared her to death,

47:04.868 --> 47:07.868
so she wasn't gonna say anything in court

47:07.870 --> 47:08.970
unless someone asked her.

47:08.972 --> 47:11.171
She wasn't gonna voluntarily say anything.

47:11.173 --> 47:13.808
And so all this time, no
one's ever talked to you.

47:13.810 --> 47:15.944
No one's ever asked you.
No one's ever said anything.

47:15.946 --> 47:17.779
Bill, voice-over: She
wanted to convey to me

47:17.781 --> 47:19.948
that Ryan should not have gone to jail,

47:19.950 --> 47:21.649
he should not have been found guilty,

47:21.651 --> 47:24.319
uh, that... that he was
not the person that she saw.

47:24.321 --> 47:26.955
Just... just for the
record just one more time,

47:26.957 --> 47:29.823
you are absolutely 110% sure

47:29.825 --> 47:31.959
that the person you saw in the parking lot

47:31.961 --> 47:33.428
was not Ryan Ferguson.

47:33.430 --> 47:34.495
Oh, positive.

47:34.497 --> 47:37.332
I mean, it was exhilarating, like, "Aha!"

47:37.334 --> 47:41.201
but I knew it wasn't enough to save Ryan,

47:41.203 --> 47:45.040
but what it was... it's
like they say in Australia...

47:45.042 --> 47:47.676
the thin edge of the wedge.

47:47.678 --> 47:48.944
What does that mean?

47:48.946 --> 47:53.013
Well, sometimes people use
wedges to cut down trees,

47:53.015 --> 47:55.883
and it's a wedge, and you take a hammer,

47:55.885 --> 47:59.053
sledgehammer, and you drive this wedge

47:59.055 --> 48:02.057
into the tree, and it
starts to split the tree,

48:02.059 --> 48:04.125
and you keep hitting it and hitting it

48:04.127 --> 48:05.859
and driving it deeper and deeper,

48:05.861 --> 48:08.062
and the tree will fall over,

48:08.064 --> 48:12.135
and for me, that was a
thin edge of the wedge.

48:17.941 --> 48:21.475
Being in real estate has
really been a godsend.

48:21.477 --> 48:25.113
I've been fortunate to,
uh, have a profession

48:25.115 --> 48:28.982
that allows me the flexibility
to come and go as I want

48:28.984 --> 48:33.089
any time I want while I'm
still investigating Ryan's case.

48:37.127 --> 48:40.428
I always feel I've been short-changed

48:40.430 --> 48:43.865
by not being able to
play basketball with Ryan.

48:43.867 --> 48:45.799
First time we ever played against anybody,

48:45.801 --> 48:47.000
he was 10 years old.

48:47.002 --> 48:48.201
He was practicing his
shot right next to the goal

48:48.203 --> 48:49.437
where you hit the little
square and it goes in,

48:49.439 --> 48:52.741
and we practiced that for
about... about 20 minutes.

48:52.743 --> 48:54.109
He had that shot down pretty good,

48:54.111 --> 48:56.111
so I saw these two guys, you know,

48:56.113 --> 48:57.212
these two high-school kids.

48:57.214 --> 49:00.415
I said, um, "Hey..." without telling Ryan,

49:00.417 --> 49:04.118
I said, "Hey, would you guys
like to play... play two on two?"

49:04.120 --> 49:06.386
and they're looking at us,

49:06.388 --> 49:09.022
and they're looking at me, an old guy,

49:09.024 --> 49:11.024
and looking at Ryan, some kid,

49:11.026 --> 49:13.060
and they're going,
"Well, who gets the kid?"

49:13.062 --> 49:14.895
I go, "Ryan and I will play you two."

49:14.897 --> 49:16.163
"Pfft, OK."

49:16.165 --> 49:18.433
So, um, I told Ryan, I said,

49:18.435 --> 49:21.269
"Uh, they're gonna
double-up on me," I said,

49:21.271 --> 49:23.872
"but you just take your place by the goal,

49:23.874 --> 49:25.272
"that shot we've been practicing,

49:25.274 --> 49:29.042
"and I will drive on these
guys like they will not believe.

49:29.044 --> 49:31.245
"Ha! Don't let them deter you.

49:31.247 --> 49:33.480
"Just stand tight and shoot your shot,

49:33.482 --> 49:35.549
and I think we're gonna beat them."

49:35.551 --> 49:36.750
"Oh, I don't know."

49:36.752 --> 49:38.086
I says, "Oh, let's just
try," and, sure enough,

49:38.088 --> 49:41.189
we beat them 8-10, and he...
he made the last two shots.

49:41.191 --> 49:44.158
Ha ha! Ah, they couldn't believe it,

49:44.160 --> 49:48.095
and it almost makes me want
to cry thinking about it.

49:48.097 --> 49:49.863
I don't know why.

49:49.865 --> 49:51.064
Uh...

49:51.066 --> 49:52.966
[Clears throat]

49:52.968 --> 49:55.470
from that time on, until he was arrested,

49:55.472 --> 49:58.406
we averaged playing
basketball, on the average,

49:58.408 --> 50:01.944
once a week until he was arrested.

50:07.484 --> 50:11.352
Ryan, voice-over: Basketball
has given me the opportunity

50:11.354 --> 50:14.455
to gain respect, and I'm not very good...

50:14.457 --> 50:16.558
I'm not trying to act like I'm good...

50:16.560 --> 50:19.526
but in prison, it's doesn't
take that much to be good.

50:19.528 --> 50:22.162
Like, you know, I'm very
intelligent for prison,

50:22.164 --> 50:24.365
so in here, I can play basketball

50:24.367 --> 50:26.167
a lot better than a lot of these people

50:26.169 --> 50:28.102
because they've never
played organized sports.

50:28.104 --> 50:30.138
They never actually understood

50:30.140 --> 50:32.506
that to get good at something,
you have to practice it.

50:32.508 --> 50:34.975
You can't just go out and play it.

50:34.977 --> 50:37.278
When I went to the yard for
the first time, I was scared.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.578
If you're this little,
white dude and, you know,

50:38.580 --> 50:40.615
the ball goes up on the rim
and you've got these guys

50:40.617 --> 50:42.250
and they're big and they're...
they think they're tough

50:42.252 --> 50:44.218
or whatever and you can
just dribble around them,

50:44.220 --> 50:46.386
you actually can keep control of the ball

50:46.388 --> 50:48.890
and you can drive to the
hoop and you can jump up

50:48.892 --> 50:52.392
and outrebound them partially
because of your jumping ability

50:52.394 --> 50:54.962
but partially because
you can get there first,

50:54.964 --> 50:57.265
they're just like,
"Damn, this dude's good,"

50:57.267 --> 50:59.167
and if you're good at basketball in prison,

50:59.169 --> 51:01.002
people are like, "Oh, I respect you,"

51:01.004 --> 51:02.937
because you're an athlete.

51:02.939 --> 51:05.240
Get that respect, and then
you don't have to worry

51:05.242 --> 51:08.778
about people testing you, essentially.

51:13.383 --> 51:16.216
Erickson: ...in the parking lot.

51:16.218 --> 51:18.218
Short: OK, so you're sitting on the curb.

51:18.220 --> 51:21.023
You hear people yelling.
Where'd you guys go?

51:27.530 --> 51:29.330
Bill, voice-over: When
Charles Erickson was being

51:29.332 --> 51:32.033
interviewed by the police,
he said that he saw his friend

51:32.035 --> 51:34.035
Dallas Mallory at this intersection

51:34.037 --> 51:35.370
at 2:30 in the morning.

51:35.372 --> 51:37.337
Erickson: I think right after that

51:37.339 --> 51:40.207
is where we saw Dallas at that light,

51:40.209 --> 51:41.508
at this intersection right there.

51:41.510 --> 51:43.310
Short: So you stopped, and... and you guys

51:43.312 --> 51:44.412
talked to him briefly?

51:44.414 --> 51:46.480
It was just pure chance that he was there.

51:46.482 --> 51:49.651
Bill, voice-over: He saw
Dallas, uh, in his car

51:49.653 --> 51:51.586
southbound on Providence,

51:51.588 --> 51:53.321
stopped at a red light.

51:53.323 --> 51:55.323
They went and had that conversation.

51:55.325 --> 51:56.924
They heard the sirens,

51:56.926 --> 51:58.426
and Dallas took off,

51:58.428 --> 52:01.562
and then Ryan took... allegedly...
ran to the By George nightclub.

52:01.564 --> 52:03.464
That was the story. That's
what everybody believed.

52:03.466 --> 52:07.701
Bill: I would go down to the crime scene

52:07.703 --> 52:09.537
on a fairly regular basis.

52:09.539 --> 52:13.207
I remember standing next to
one of the petrol stations,

52:13.209 --> 52:14.774
and I looked over at the intersection

52:14.776 --> 52:18.645
where Charles Erickson said they
saw this friend... Dallas Mallory.

52:18.647 --> 52:22.616
And it was like something in
the back of my mind is saying,

52:22.618 --> 52:24.618
"It's right there. It's right there."

52:24.620 --> 52:26.587
And there it was, this flashing yellow.

52:26.589 --> 52:29.691
It had been flashing yellow forever.

52:29.693 --> 52:30.926
I'm thinking, "My gosh!

52:30.928 --> 52:33.694
"If that inter... if that
light at that intersection

52:33.696 --> 52:36.497
"is flashing yellow at 1:00,

52:36.499 --> 52:41.602
then it was flashing yellow that
night of the murder at 2:15."

52:41.604 --> 52:43.604
So, there's no way that Dallas Mallory

52:43.606 --> 52:46.506
would be stopped at that intersection

52:46.508 --> 52:52.412
that Erickson and Ryan could have
walked over and had a conversation.

52:52.414 --> 52:54.482
That's when I realized
that wasn't even possible.

52:54.484 --> 52:57.384
Man: Did witnesses who could
have set Ryan Ferguson free

52:57.386 --> 52:58.486
not take the stand during his first trial?

52:58.488 --> 53:00.388
Good evening, everyone. I'm John Bassford.

53:00.390 --> 53:01.589
And I'm Stefani Schaefer.

53:01.591 --> 53:03.091
Ferguson's lawyer says yes,

53:03.093 --> 53:04.459
and today started trying to convince

53:04.461 --> 53:05.928
a Boone County judge of that.

53:11.401 --> 53:16.104
Bill: Your first opportunity
to present any new evidence

53:16.106 --> 53:17.471
is the evidentiary hearing.

53:17.473 --> 53:20.441
That's after you jump through
the other meaningless hoops.

53:20.443 --> 53:21.741
And so our first opportunity...

53:21.743 --> 53:24.044
we did everything as quick
as you could possibly do it.

53:24.046 --> 53:26.546
So, the quickest we could
ever introduce new evidence

53:26.548 --> 53:28.618
was the 2008 evidentiary hearing.

53:33.289 --> 53:34.522
[Chains rattling]

53:34.524 --> 53:37.424
We felt pretty upbeat. We
felt like, you know what,

53:37.426 --> 53:38.558
we're gonna prevail here.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.761
This is what our attorney should have done,

53:40.763 --> 53:43.464
and here we are having
to do it 3 years later.

53:43.466 --> 53:46.334
We contacted the Public Defender's office,

53:46.336 --> 53:48.368
and Valarie Leftwich was the attorney

53:48.370 --> 53:50.037
that worked with us.

53:50.039 --> 53:51.571
She was very gifted, very smart,

53:51.573 --> 53:55.209
and very energetic and really
wanted to do a good job.

53:55.211 --> 53:57.645
[Chains rattling]

53:57.647 --> 53:59.413
Woman: Well, Stefani, Ferguson's attorney

53:59.415 --> 54:01.549
called 11 witnesses to the stand today

54:01.551 --> 54:02.750
and asked them the same question.

54:02.752 --> 54:05.553
Were they contacted by
Ferguson's former attorney

54:05.555 --> 54:07.455
to testify in the original trial?

54:07.457 --> 54:08.955
Most of the answers were
no, and she pointed out

54:08.957 --> 54:13.195
that some of their testimony
could have changed Ferguson's case.

54:15.731 --> 54:18.098
Woman: Can you state your
full name for the court?

54:18.100 --> 54:20.067
Dallas Wade Mallory.

54:20.069 --> 54:22.470
Bill: Dallas was probably
not called as a witness

54:22.472 --> 54:24.471
for either the prosecution or the defense

54:24.473 --> 54:26.506
'cause neither one of
'em had confidence in him.

54:26.508 --> 54:30.745
They did not know what he would
say once he got on the stand.

54:30.747 --> 54:32.479
Mallory: I was scared of the detectives.

54:32.481 --> 54:34.816
They were screaming at me, yelling at me,

54:34.818 --> 54:37.551
telling me I was a liar,
that I knew information,

54:37.553 --> 54:39.120
and I wasn't telling the truth.

54:39.122 --> 54:40.421
And I was telling the truth.

54:40.423 --> 54:41.955
Bill: And so, finally, at the very end,

54:41.957 --> 54:47.194
Dallas told the police, "I will
say whatever you want me to say.

54:47.196 --> 54:48.562
Just let me out of here."

54:48.564 --> 54:50.198
Woman: Initially, you told them

54:50.200 --> 54:52.299
that you must have seen Chuck...

54:52.301 --> 54:54.734
Right. On second thought,
maybe I did see him.

54:54.736 --> 54:56.636
Well, if I did, where did I see him at?

54:56.638 --> 54:58.506
they told me I saw him in a car

54:58.508 --> 55:00.508
that I was driving with 2 females,

55:00.510 --> 55:02.109
which I couldn't have been driving.

55:02.111 --> 55:03.444
Woman: Why not?

55:03.446 --> 55:05.779
I had no license or automobile at the time.

55:05.781 --> 55:07.147
Woman: And why was that?

55:07.149 --> 55:08.783
Due to a DWI conviction.

55:08.785 --> 55:12.120
Woman: So, you never stopped in a
car in downtown Columbia that night?

55:12.122 --> 55:13.187
No.

55:13.189 --> 55:15.122
Woman: Did you see Chuck Erickson at all?

55:15.124 --> 55:16.323
Mallory: No.

55:16.325 --> 55:18.758
Woman: And on that same
Halloween night in 2001,

55:18.760 --> 55:21.895
did you ever see Ryan
Ferguson in downtown Columbia?

55:21.897 --> 55:23.100
No.

55:26.769 --> 55:28.535
Gingras: One eyewitness to the crime

55:28.537 --> 55:31.471
even claimed when police
arrested Erickson and Ferguson,

55:31.473 --> 55:33.040
she said they had the wrong people

55:33.042 --> 55:36.810
but was too intimidated to say
that under oath in the first trial.

55:36.812 --> 55:38.379
I said it wasn't him.

55:38.381 --> 55:40.413
I told my boyfriend. I
told everybody I knew.

55:40.415 --> 55:42.816
Woman: At that point then, did you, um...

55:42.818 --> 55:45.153
meet with the prosecutor about
being a witness in the case?

55:45.155 --> 55:46.354
Yes.

55:46.356 --> 55:47.821
Woman: And who was that
prosecutor you met with?

55:47.823 --> 55:49.022
Crane.

55:49.024 --> 55:50.191
- Woman: Is that Kevin Crane?
- Kevin Crane, yeah.

55:50.193 --> 55:53.194
Did you tell him about
seeing the pictures on...

55:53.196 --> 55:54.895
Yeah, that's the first
thing I told him when I...

55:54.897 --> 55:57.798
when we first talked, that
that was not the kids I seen.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.433
So, you told him definitely it was not...

55:59.435 --> 56:00.935
I told him several times.

56:00.937 --> 56:02.602
Ornt: He scared me... Crane.

56:02.604 --> 56:03.636
So you were scared of Mr. Crane?

56:03.638 --> 56:05.038
Yeah, he just kind of intimidated me.

56:05.040 --> 56:08.808
He made me feel like I was
wrong about what I was saying.

56:08.810 --> 56:12.647
Announcer: ABC17 News at 6:00 starts now.

56:12.649 --> 56:15.582
ABC17's Greg DeGrando is live
at the Boone County Courthouse

56:15.584 --> 56:17.450
with more on wrap-up of the hearing.

56:17.452 --> 56:18.886
DeGrando: I spoke with both attorneys,

56:18.888 --> 56:21.221
and they told me they're happy
with the way everything went.

56:21.223 --> 56:23.924
The state says it proved
he received a fair trial.

56:23.926 --> 56:27.828
but the defense says it got all the
evidence that it wanted to to get out there,

56:27.830 --> 56:30.564
and it shows that a new trial is needed.

56:30.566 --> 56:34.569
As for Ferguson's family, his father
Bill says that he couldn't be happier

56:34.571 --> 56:37.705
and is confident that the
judge will ask for a new trial.

56:37.707 --> 56:40.841
Reporting live in Columbia,
I'm Greg DeGrando, ABC17 News.

56:40.843 --> 56:43.343
Moriarty: The more we learned information

56:43.345 --> 56:45.912
that the defense did not know about...

56:45.914 --> 56:50.584
um, people who never testified
who should have testified,

56:50.586 --> 56:53.587
um, then you begin to think, "Oh, my gosh,

56:53.589 --> 56:55.790
this really could be an innocent man."

56:55.792 --> 56:59.526
Ryan: I've taught myself so many things,

56:59.528 --> 57:01.895
like prison pizza.

57:01.897 --> 57:05.399
You take Ramen noodles and graham crackers.

57:05.401 --> 57:07.234
Crunch it up into a powder, essentially.

57:07.236 --> 57:08.636
Put it in the trash bag,

57:08.638 --> 57:11.638
and then you pour boiling water on it.

57:11.640 --> 57:14.508
Let that sit for 2 or 3 minutes, whatever.

57:14.510 --> 57:19.513
And it actually, you know, turns into
like this ball of dough, essentially.

57:19.515 --> 57:21.881
You can flatten it out,
and that's your crust.

57:21.883 --> 57:24.785
You put refried beans on top of it,

57:24.787 --> 57:26.787
and then you put chili on top of that.

57:26.789 --> 57:28.488
You can put anything you
want, but that's what I...

57:28.490 --> 57:29.756
these are the best.

57:29.758 --> 57:31.424
It's taken years to develop.

57:31.426 --> 57:33.660
Tuna with summer sausage.

57:33.662 --> 57:35.263
Just cut it up, throw it on there.

57:35.265 --> 57:36.531
Uh, pickles,

57:36.533 --> 57:39.899
and then crunch up some
sour cream-and-onion chips.

57:39.901 --> 57:42.669
Sprinkle that on. A little bit of ranch.

57:42.671 --> 57:45.272
Even a little bit of
honey is good, too, so...

57:45.274 --> 57:47.209
That's it. Voila!

57:57.419 --> 58:01.055
Leslie: There have been times
when I totally fall apart.

58:01.057 --> 58:03.723
There are times when I wake
up in the middle of the night,

58:03.725 --> 58:05.459
and I just sit straight up in bed

58:05.461 --> 58:08.296
and I think, "Oh, my gosh. It's been years

58:08.298 --> 58:09.796
and Ryan has had no life."

58:09.798 --> 58:13.933
I mean, there are just times
where it just really strikes you.

58:13.935 --> 58:17.071
Once every 4 months, he
can have a food visit.

58:17.073 --> 58:20.573
I usually have to work on a
food visit for about 3 days

58:20.575 --> 58:22.877
because Ryan wants so
many different flavors

58:22.879 --> 58:24.544
since he doesn't get to taste things.

58:24.546 --> 58:26.946
His very favorite thing is fruit.

58:26.948 --> 58:31.319
What I used to do was just cut up
every kind of fresh fruit I could find.

58:31.321 --> 58:33.953
And he would take the lid off
and he would just sit there

58:33.955 --> 58:36.323
looking at it for about 5 minutes

58:36.325 --> 58:37.725
before he would eat anything.

58:37.727 --> 58:40.328
He'd just say, "Oh, my gosh. The color!"

58:40.330 --> 58:44.865
Then all of a sudden they posted
that we could no longer bring fruit,

58:44.867 --> 58:46.334
fresh fruit.

58:46.336 --> 58:47.935
That was a real blow.

58:47.937 --> 58:50.970
But this last time...

58:50.972 --> 58:54.975
I was determined I was
gonna take peaches in to him.

58:54.977 --> 58:57.745
And I probably shouldn't
say this on camera,

58:57.747 --> 59:02.350
but... but I actually put some
peaches in under the spinach.

59:02.352 --> 59:04.017
Ha ha. Like one fresh peach.

59:04.019 --> 59:06.654
And I thought, "If they make me
throw it out, I throw it out."

59:06.656 --> 59:08.988
In the whole place, when you
walk into the visiting room,

59:08.990 --> 59:11.991
there's this podium, and
the guards stand right there.

59:11.993 --> 59:14.995
And if you sit in the table
right next to the podium,

59:14.997 --> 59:16.763
they can hear everything you say.

59:16.765 --> 59:18.933
It's like they're watching
every move you make.

59:18.935 --> 59:21.000
And that's where we were sitting.

59:21.002 --> 59:22.169
And I thought, "Oh, no."

59:22.171 --> 59:24.805
And I mean, he could
probably get a violation

59:24.807 --> 59:27.607
if they knew we really
snuck those in, you know.

59:27.609 --> 59:31.444
We hadn't sat down yet, and they
could tell people were coming in.

59:31.446 --> 59:32.680
We were kind of in the way.

59:32.682 --> 59:34.781
And so, one of the guards
came over, and he goes,

59:34.783 --> 59:36.383
"I think we're gonna
move you guys to the back.

59:36.385 --> 59:37.484
Do you mind?"

59:37.486 --> 59:39.787
And we're like, "No, that would be great."

59:39.789 --> 59:42.022
So, unfortunately, I didn't cut up a lot

59:42.024 --> 59:44.792
because I thought I was
gonna have to throw it out,

59:44.794 --> 59:47.364
but he did get to taste the fresh peaches.

59:55.405 --> 59:57.805
Today, a Cole County judge
denied a request for an appeal

59:57.807 --> 59:59.640
from convicted murderer Ryan Ferguson.

59:59.642 --> 01:00:02.609
We got word of the ruling
late this afternoon.

01:00:02.611 --> 01:00:04.412
This ruling can be appealed.

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:07.548
Bill: What did the judge say?

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.716
The witnesses have no credibility.

01:00:09.718 --> 01:00:12.553
As long as you're tethered
to the motion court,

01:00:12.555 --> 01:00:15.823
there is no courthouse, you're
never gonna win that appeal

01:00:15.825 --> 01:00:19.426
because they're protecting
the verdict at any cost.

01:00:19.428 --> 01:00:20.961
[Telephone ringing]
Woman, on recording: Hello.

01:00:20.963 --> 01:00:22.696
This is a prepaid collect call from...

01:00:22.698 --> 01:00:24.131
Ryan: Ryan.

01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:25.832
Woman, on recording: This call
is from a correctional facility

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:27.935
and may be monitored and recorded.

01:00:27.937 --> 01:00:28.836
[Beep]

01:00:28.838 --> 01:00:30.406
Bill: Hey, man, how you doin'?

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.309
Bill: Yeah.

01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:54.396
Ryan: I am. I am.

01:00:56.865 --> 01:00:59.034
Woman, on recording: Thank
you for using Evercom.

01:01:10.111 --> 01:01:14.113
Bill: Ryan had met a girl, and they
were corresponding back and forth,

01:01:14.115 --> 01:01:19.118
and she had seen Kathleen
Zellner on "60 Minutes"

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.122
solving another case, getting
the person out of prison

01:01:22.124 --> 01:01:24.892
and solving the case for the police.

01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:28.495
I was watching one of
those programs... "48 Hours"

01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:29.897
with my husband,

01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:33.500
and I watched it, and I could tell,

01:01:33.502 --> 01:01:37.872
when Ryan testified, he
was not prepared correctly.

01:01:37.874 --> 01:01:39.439
I wrote his name down on a piece of paper.

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:43.877
And I told my husband... I said,
"If he... if his family contacts me,

01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:45.781
I'm gonna take this case pro bono."

01:01:47.917 --> 01:01:51.852
Bill: I sent an e-mail to
Kathleen Zellner about midnight,

01:01:51.854 --> 01:01:54.522
'cause I work late.

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:56.589
And the next morning at noon...

01:01:56.591 --> 01:01:58.926
I'll... I'll never forget it.

01:01:58.928 --> 01:02:00.227
The phone rings, and it's Kathleen Zellner.

01:02:00.229 --> 01:02:04.163
Come and walk the crime
scene with me and visit Ryan.

01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:08.935
And she said... and this is one of
the top attorneys in the United States.

01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:11.538
She says, "How about weekend after next?"

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.942
When she decides that she's gonna
represent you, you're represented.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:18.645
You are going to be... rest assured...

01:02:18.647 --> 01:02:22.484
that you're gonna have the
best representation possible.

01:02:23.818 --> 01:02:27.187
Zellner: I definitely don't like to lose.

01:02:27.189 --> 01:02:30.823
I'm gonna kill you if I'm
in combat with you, so...

01:02:30.825 --> 01:02:32.959
My brothers were terrified of me.

01:02:32.961 --> 01:02:36.196
Um... no, no. I mean... like with Ryan,

01:02:36.198 --> 01:02:39.198
I mean, he's gettin'
out. I can guarantee it.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.134
You have to have that force of personality,

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:43.571
'cause who's gonna believe you.

01:02:43.573 --> 01:02:46.876
You can't come in there like, you know,
"Well, just, I'm killin' time here."

01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:54.113
Last time I saw Ryan, which
was about 3 or 4 weeks ago,

01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:56.584
um, another inmate had
been stabbed to death

01:02:56.586 --> 01:02:57.785
the day before.

01:02:57.787 --> 01:03:01.354
And people have no idea
what it's like in there.

01:03:01.356 --> 01:03:05.859
It's so hard to have, I think,
any hope, to keep that alive.

01:03:05.861 --> 01:03:10.263
And he's told me sometimes that
he feels like he's invisible.

01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:13.033
He says, "It's like I'm
disappearing. I'm dying."

01:03:13.035 --> 01:03:15.234
It's really... someone's really dying,

01:03:15.236 --> 01:03:18.508
and they're dying a very slow death.

01:03:24.013 --> 01:03:27.381
Ryan: Being in the situation
that I'm in, in prison,

01:03:27.383 --> 01:03:30.017
maximum security from day one,

01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:33.220
I've understood that you
can't... be vulnerable.

01:03:33.222 --> 01:03:36.223
You can't let people see your weaknesses.

01:03:36.225 --> 01:03:39.258
The emotions are definitely there,

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.162
and they want to come
out, they just don't know.

01:03:42.164 --> 01:03:46.265
It's... it's frightening
to let them out, I guess.

01:03:46.267 --> 01:03:49.136
Chick flicks, for real.
I love chick flicks.

01:03:49.138 --> 01:03:51.270
They bring this emotional
element to my life

01:03:51.272 --> 01:03:53.240
that I can't experience right now.

01:03:53.242 --> 01:03:54.774
You can't experience it in here.

01:03:54.776 --> 01:03:56.243
I remember when I first got to prison.

01:03:56.245 --> 01:03:59.279
I was in a room with this guy,
and he was... he was hardcore.

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:02.182
He was big, he was strong, he was mean.

01:04:02.184 --> 01:04:06.285
And I'd just gotten my TV,
and he was watching his.

01:04:06.287 --> 01:04:08.187
And, uh, we watched "The Notebook."

01:04:08.189 --> 01:04:10.057
They put it on The Movie Channel.

01:04:10.059 --> 01:04:12.191
And I'm like, "This is
a good movie, you know."

01:04:12.193 --> 01:04:14.294
And I'm sittin' on my bed
and it ends, and I'm like,

01:04:14.296 --> 01:04:16.863
"Damn, I wanna cry," you know, like...

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:18.665
I'm like trying to hold it back,

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:22.669
and he's sayin' something,
and I'm like I can't speak

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:24.037
because I will cry.

01:04:24.039 --> 01:04:25.305
I can't cry with this dude in the room.

01:04:25.307 --> 01:04:27.908
And then I hear him crying! Ha ha!

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.910
And it was one of the most intriguing
moments that I had in prison.

01:04:30.912 --> 01:04:33.312
'Cause I was like, "If this guy
can cry, I should be able to."

01:04:33.314 --> 01:04:35.683
But for some reason, I still just...

01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:38.588
I can't... break that barrier.

01:04:41.957 --> 01:04:44.323
Zellner: Bill wanted
somebody to take over the case

01:04:44.325 --> 01:04:47.093
that would get into all the detail

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:49.229
and understand and go to
the crime scene with him

01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:51.098
and go back to the crime scene with him.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.834
I mean, he knows all the
police reports by number.

01:04:53.836 --> 01:04:55.334
He knows the paragraphs.

01:04:55.336 --> 01:04:58.337
He has that kind of very detailed mind

01:04:58.339 --> 01:05:02.008
that I think really
matters in a case like this.

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:05.111
We have thousands of
pages of documents scanned,

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:07.948
but if we were missing
something, I just called Bill.

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:11.350
I'll say, "Bill, I need this
report with this attachment,"

01:05:11.352 --> 01:05:13.222
and it'll be there in an hour.

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:20.093
I feel like Bill Ferguson
is the most unusual father

01:05:20.095 --> 01:05:22.196
of anybody I've ever
met in one of these cases

01:05:22.198 --> 01:05:26.366
because of his persistence
in fighting for Ryan

01:05:26.368 --> 01:05:28.368
and just staying connected with him.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:32.038
And you know, he's devoted
his whole life to him.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.140
It's just like part of him died.

01:05:34.142 --> 01:05:38.680
I think that he'll never
be OK until Ryan's out.

01:05:46.756 --> 01:05:49.288
Bill: You never know in regards
to the law what could happen

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:50.490
the very next day.

01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:54.026
And in our case, the next
day was Chuck Erickson

01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:56.363
sending a letter to Ryan.

01:05:56.365 --> 01:05:59.399
And when he received it... he
could see the return address...

01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:02.468
he was a little apprehensive
about even opening it.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:07.473
First time in this whole saga
that there was any communication.

01:06:07.475 --> 01:06:11.011
Ryan: I was fearful to know that
he can say whatever he wants.

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:13.781
'cause I don't know what he
knows and what he doesn't know

01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:15.149
in terms of the facts.

01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:19.285
Like, I think he really was
either asleep or blacked out,

01:06:19.287 --> 01:06:20.620
and he doesn't know if he was there or not.

01:06:20.622 --> 01:06:24.323
I know he wasn't there, but
has he figured that out yet?

01:06:24.325 --> 01:06:25.859
He didn't show me the letter

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:28.060
because he's not allowed to bring
anything into the visiting room.

01:06:28.062 --> 01:06:30.531
So what he told me was
what was in the letter...

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:34.200
basically saying, "Next time
your attorney is in town,

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:36.035
could you have her come and visit me?"

01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:38.437
Zellner: It was the first
real chance, I thought,

01:06:38.439 --> 01:06:41.274
that Ryan had of gaining his freedom.

01:06:41.276 --> 01:06:44.444
And so, I immediately contacted
a court reporting service,

01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:47.480
because I wanted to
videotape this statement.

01:06:47.482 --> 01:06:51.754
And then, I needed to get
to Missouri immediately.

01:06:54.089 --> 01:06:55.823
Woman: ...nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

01:06:55.825 --> 01:06:57.825
I do.

01:06:57.827 --> 01:06:59.158
Zellner: May I call you Chuck?

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.459
Uh, Mr. Erickson or Charles.

01:07:00.461 --> 01:07:02.229
- Mr. Erickson.
- I don't go by Chuck.

01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:04.230
OK. Are you stating today under oath

01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:07.066
that this statement is
an accurate rendition

01:07:07.068 --> 01:07:13.240
of what happened in the robbery
and murder of Mr. Ha... Heinholt?

01:07:13.242 --> 01:07:15.308
Heitholt. Yeah, that's correct.

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.477
Zellner: I thought he was going to say

01:07:17.479 --> 01:07:22.082
that neither one of them
was involved in the murder.

01:07:22.084 --> 01:07:24.484
but that's not what he said.

01:07:24.486 --> 01:07:28.254
Things happened much differently
than I had previously stated.

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:29.622
I believe that I flipped out,

01:07:29.624 --> 01:07:32.491
committed the entire act alone
and with little forethought.

01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:36.495
I remember feeling psychotically
giddy, if that's understandable.

01:07:36.497 --> 01:07:40.000
Uh, I did not tell Ryan
what I was going to do.

01:07:40.002 --> 01:07:42.468
He had no idea that I would act
in such an aggressive manner.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.173
I don't remember how much...
how much of it he was there for.

01:07:46.175 --> 01:07:47.408
He could not stop me.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:52.312
Zellner: I was flabbergasted
at what he was saying,

01:07:52.314 --> 01:07:56.051
because I didn't think it made sense.

01:07:57.952 --> 01:08:01.888
Ryan did not say, "Come on,
let's get this over with"

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:03.290
while I was stalking the victim.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:06.292
He was actually pleading,
"Come on, let's go."

01:08:06.294 --> 01:08:08.294
Erickson: I thought that the
only way I could help Ryan

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:10.631
was to take responsibility for everything

01:08:10.633 --> 01:08:14.166
because Jerry Trump put
us at the murder scene.

01:08:14.168 --> 01:08:15.468
I don't know how you get around that.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.139
I regret now that I put an
innocent man through that.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.375
Erickson: I didn't want it on my conscience

01:08:21.377 --> 01:08:24.310
that I'd put somebody
in prison based on lies.

01:08:24.312 --> 01:08:27.046
And I couldn't live with myself.

01:08:27.048 --> 01:08:33.319
Zellner: Are you saying today that you
are the sole murderer of Kent Heitholt?

01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:35.988
That's correct. Yes.

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:37.557
Are you kidding me?

01:08:37.559 --> 01:08:40.193
Zellner: There were too
many evidentiary points

01:08:40.194 --> 01:08:42.562
that showed that they were both innocent.

01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:48.470
So I really was completely thrown by
the fact that he gave me that story.

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:55.242
[People speaking indistinctly on TV]

01:08:55.243 --> 01:08:57.344
Bill: As I watched the trial,

01:08:57.345 --> 01:09:01.348
I realized as Jerry Trump is testifying

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:05.585
that his wife had sent
him the newspaper article.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:07.586
Trump: I didn't know she was sending that.

01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:13.359
And opening my mail, I first
turned to the 2 pictures.

01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:16.729
Bill: And then I realize,
much to my great surprise,

01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:22.501
that there is no documentation that
anybody had talked to Mrs. Trump.

01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:26.604
My detective skills, I guess
you could say, were improving.

01:09:26.607 --> 01:09:30.978
And so I realized that I could
find anybody in this country

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:32.612
that I wanted to.

01:09:32.613 --> 01:09:37.984
So I started a process of
trying to locate Mrs. Trump,

01:09:37.986 --> 01:09:39.354
and I found out where she was.

01:09:43.524 --> 01:09:45.992
I got there about 5:00 in the afternoon.

01:09:45.993 --> 01:09:47.428
It was still very light.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:50.630
Knocked on the door and told
her my name was Bill Ferguson

01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:53.666
and I'm doing the follow-up
on the Kent Heitholt murder.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:56.402
And she says immediately, "I
don't know anything about that."

01:09:56.404 --> 01:09:58.537
I said, "I know, but you may have.

01:09:58.539 --> 01:10:00.540
"You could be a material witness.

01:10:00.542 --> 01:10:02.608
You may have information
that you're not aware of it."

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:05.644
And so I had an outline of
everything I was gonna ask her.

01:10:05.646 --> 01:10:08.682
I looked pretty official,
and I felt pretty confident,

01:10:08.684 --> 01:10:10.384
'cause I used to watch "Perry Mason,"

01:10:10.386 --> 01:10:12.452
and, uh, I think I learned a lot there.

01:10:12.454 --> 01:10:14.653
I use a technique that I call the Figure 8,

01:10:14.655 --> 01:10:17.124
where you ask a series of questions

01:10:17.126 --> 01:10:19.658
and then you loop back and
re-ask them in a different way.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.362
And if they answer in a
positive way both times,

01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:23.529
then you know they're telling the truth.

01:10:23.531 --> 01:10:25.064
If they don't tell the
truth to start out with

01:10:25.066 --> 01:10:27.666
and you ask the follow-up question
and they change their answer,

01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:31.203
then you know you're dealing with
a witness that has no credibility.

01:10:31.205 --> 01:10:33.473
So I used that Figure 8 technique,

01:10:33.475 --> 01:10:35.442
and so I knew she was a credible witness.

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:38.045
And her testimony was...
or her statement to me was,

01:10:38.047 --> 01:10:40.080
"I did not send that newspaper.

01:10:40.082 --> 01:10:42.816
"I never had that newspaper.
I never bought the newspaper.

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:45.318
I don't know anything about a newspaper."

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.719
I said, "OK, thank you very much."

01:10:46.721 --> 01:10:49.488
And then she says... and I
ask her a few more questions...

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:52.059
and she goes, "What did
you say your name was?"

01:10:52.061 --> 01:10:53.326
I said, "Bill Ferguson."

01:10:53.328 --> 01:10:55.528
She goes, "Yeah. You're Ryan's father."

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.863
I said, "Yes, ma'am."

01:10:56.865 --> 01:10:59.299
She goes, "I don't know if
I should be talking to you."

01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:00.867
I said, "It's just fine."

01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:03.069
I said, "Well, look, I'm gonna
leave now, and thank you very much."

01:11:03.071 --> 01:11:04.539
And so I did.

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:12.112
Zellner: Not to be condescending,

01:11:12.114 --> 01:11:15.081
but the idea that there's
7 unidentified prints

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.349
and it excludes them?

01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:18.718
Most places, they never
would have pursued the case.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.621
That would have been
it. They're not involved.

01:11:21.623 --> 01:11:24.491
It's so hard to undo these things.

01:11:24.493 --> 01:11:26.492
That's what I think is wrong.

01:11:26.494 --> 01:11:28.495
I think that's what needs to be changed.

01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:31.264
It should not be this difficult.

01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:32.866
- Hello.
- Woman: How are you?

01:11:32.868 --> 01:11:36.502
Zellner: They did not like it that
we came here from another state.

01:11:36.504 --> 01:11:38.737
You know, this is a closed club here.

01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:41.108
They didn't like it that we came here.

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:45.344
Then they really didn't like it
that we found all this evidence

01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:49.515
and that we were making the
prosecutor, who's now a judge, look bad.

01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:51.751
That was like, "Oh, you
don't do stuff like that."

01:11:51.753 --> 01:11:54.520
Even though somebody's life's at stake,

01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:55.788
that's not OK.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:58.390
Their first tack was to
try to get us off the case,

01:11:58.392 --> 01:12:00.292
get us disqualified.

01:12:00.294 --> 01:12:01.760
That didn't work, um...

01:12:01.762 --> 01:12:03.662
And we've had people do that before.

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:05.698
I always take it as a compliment.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.466
They've tried to threaten us.

01:12:07.468 --> 01:12:12.471
They've, you know, tried to report us
to the Illinois Disciplinary Commission.

01:12:12.473 --> 01:12:17.012
Um, I mean, this has been
down and dirty the whole way.

01:12:18.814 --> 01:12:23.183
They didn't like that
Erickson had started to talk.

01:12:23.185 --> 01:12:26.452
There was a period of time
prior to the Habeus hearing

01:12:26.454 --> 01:12:30.456
that we were able to
share with Charles Erickson

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:33.160
what the witnesses had actually said,

01:12:33.162 --> 01:12:36.162
not the false police reports
that the police had given him.

01:12:36.164 --> 01:12:38.631
The police definitely
took advantage of the fact

01:12:38.633 --> 01:12:39.733
that I didn't remember.

01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:43.536
And... you know, apparently they, you know,

01:12:43.538 --> 01:12:47.307
just inserted some false
police reports in my discovery.

01:12:47.309 --> 01:12:48.742
They tricked him into pleading guilty,

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:52.411
and they did it by telling him,
"Oh, Ferguson's making a deal.

01:12:52.413 --> 01:12:54.514
"He's gonna make a deal, and
if you don't plead guilty,

01:12:54.516 --> 01:12:57.884
he's gonna beat you to it and
you're gonna get life in prison."

01:12:57.886 --> 01:13:00.886
There's all these witnesses
they lied to him about.

01:13:00.888 --> 01:13:02.855
So I just started sending him the stuff.

01:13:02.857 --> 01:13:06.626
And then he started,
because he is very bright...

01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:08.862
he started putting it together
that he'd been tricked.

01:13:08.864 --> 01:13:11.730
It was all a big trick

01:13:11.732 --> 01:13:14.201
to get him to go along with it.

01:13:14.203 --> 01:13:15.768
And the state doesn't want to hear honesty.

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.836
They want to hear what they want to hear.

01:13:17.838 --> 01:13:20.639
And they'll get you to
say what they want to hear

01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:23.977
by basically threatening the
rest of your life in prison.

01:13:23.979 --> 01:13:27.447
Bill: We were able to give
him the documentation to show

01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:31.952
that Shawna Ornt had told Crane
that that was not Ryan Ferguson,

01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:34.821
that Dallas Mallory had
in fact told the police

01:13:34.823 --> 01:13:36.622
that he had not seen them then,

01:13:36.624 --> 01:13:38.892
and he realized that he had been lied to.

01:13:38.894 --> 01:13:43.862
There's just absolutely no... no
sense of doing the right thing,

01:13:43.864 --> 01:13:45.631
even though they have no evidence.

01:13:45.633 --> 01:13:48.867
They're still trying to
prop up the conviction.

01:13:48.869 --> 01:13:54.907
And... and that's what, I think, is
just hard to, uh, wrap your mind around,

01:13:54.909 --> 01:13:57.243
that it could be that evil.

01:13:57.245 --> 01:13:58.377
Man: All rise.

01:13:58.379 --> 01:14:00.714
Moriarty: After more
than 7 years in prison,

01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:03.649
Ryan Ferguson is about to get the hearing

01:14:03.651 --> 01:14:05.417
he has dreamed about.

01:14:05.419 --> 01:14:06.486
Are you scared?

01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:08.621
Oh, I'm incredibly scared. I'm terrified.

01:14:08.623 --> 01:14:12.259
Moriarty: A chance to
convince a Missouri state judge

01:14:12.261 --> 01:14:14.196
to overturn his conviction.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:25.471
Bill: The reason that the Habeus
hearing is, uh, so important for Ryan

01:14:25.473 --> 01:14:27.607
and for us as a family,

01:14:27.609 --> 01:14:31.911
is it is the first
opportunity to present his case

01:14:31.913 --> 01:14:36.282
in a courthouse other than
where he was convicted.

01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:39.518
Zellner: So, from doing
these cases over the years,

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.291
post-conviction there can be no
piece of incriminating evidence

01:14:45.293 --> 01:14:46.492
that's left on the table.

01:14:46.494 --> 01:14:51.630
Everything has to be
recanted, shown to be false.

01:14:51.632 --> 01:14:53.832
Nothing can be left.

01:14:53.834 --> 01:14:56.803
Our next witness is Charles Erickson.

01:14:56.805 --> 01:14:58.938
Charles Erickson, at Ryan's trial,

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.941
had been extremely carefully rehearsed.

01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:05.944
He was impeached a lot, caught
up in a lot of inconsistencies,

01:15:05.946 --> 01:15:09.948
but he had a self-confidence
that made the jury believe him.

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:12.952
And the overriding thing
was that he pled guilty

01:15:12.954 --> 01:15:14.953
and was gonna get a 25-year sentence,

01:15:14.955 --> 01:15:18.023
so the jury assumed he had to be guilty.

01:15:18.025 --> 01:15:20.893
Man: Mr. Erickson, raise your
right hand if you're able.

01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:22.594
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

01:15:22.596 --> 01:15:24.464
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:15:24.466 --> 01:15:25.732
Yes, I do.

01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.968
Erickson: At the time, I
justified putting it on Ryan

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:32.738
basically because I thought he was
gonna do it to me if he had the chance,

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.040
and I wanted to save my life.

01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:36.975
I thought it was the right
thing to do for a long time.

01:15:36.977 --> 01:15:42.349
I did. And it was really,
really hard for me to accept

01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:43.783
that I did the wrong thing.

01:15:43.785 --> 01:15:47.754
Zellner: At that time, and
I'm talking about 10/30 and 31,

01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.990
um, were you using drugs?

01:15:50.992 --> 01:15:53.760
Yeah. I'd been taking a
good amount of Adderall.

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:56.362
I'd been drinking, using cocaine.

01:15:56.364 --> 01:15:58.997
Zellner: Do you have a
recollection of leaving the club?

01:15:58.999 --> 01:16:00.765
Erickson: I don't know what happened.

01:16:00.767 --> 01:16:06.773
Is it a correct statement that you
remember nothing, uh, the rest of the night

01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:08.375
until you wake up the next morning?

01:16:08.377 --> 01:16:09.576
Yeah.

01:16:09.578 --> 01:16:11.810
Zellner: When you testified
that you remembered

01:16:11.812 --> 01:16:14.781
that you robbed and beat Kent Heitholt,

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:17.649
was that testimony true or false?

01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:19.151
Erickson: It's false.

01:16:19.153 --> 01:16:22.788
Zellner: Is it true or false
that you remembered Ryan Ferguson

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:24.523
robbing and strangling Kent Heitholt?

01:16:24.525 --> 01:16:25.992
It's false.

01:16:25.994 --> 01:16:28.060
Bill: But he has a hard
time ever remembering.

01:16:28.062 --> 01:16:29.328
He has a history of that.

01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:32.031
He'll go to a party, he
would drink, smoke, whatever,

01:16:32.033 --> 01:16:33.800
and then the next day not remember it,

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.402
just totally black out,

01:16:35.404 --> 01:16:36.603
but he's functioning.

01:16:36.605 --> 01:16:38.737
So, that's what happened
the night of the murder.

01:16:38.739 --> 01:16:41.808
He was functioning, but he
has no idea what happened.

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.810
So when the police gave him
these false police reports

01:16:44.812 --> 01:16:46.645
and these false witness statements

01:16:46.647 --> 01:16:49.048
that he was down there committing a murder,

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:52.050
he's thinking, "Yeah,
I could have done that

01:16:52.052 --> 01:16:55.054
because I do things like
that when I black out."

01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:57.590
Doesn't murder people, but
he's... he's destructive.

01:16:57.592 --> 01:17:00.093
Man: And lo and behold, today you
now forget everything that happened

01:17:00.095 --> 01:17:01.827
after that until you
woke up the next morning.

01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:04.063
Is that what your
testimony is to this court?

01:17:04.065 --> 01:17:07.533
Nah, I didn't remember it when I
woke up the next morning either.

01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:08.902
Erickson: I blacked out before, and...

01:17:08.904 --> 01:17:10.603
I don't know what to tell you, man.

01:17:10.605 --> 01:17:13.773
You know what a blackout is, and I'm
sure you've blacked out before, so...

01:17:13.775 --> 01:17:16.378
Maybe not. Maybe you
don't drink at all, but...

01:17:18.446 --> 01:17:19.746
Man: You through?

01:17:19.748 --> 01:17:21.214
Yeah, I guess.

01:17:21.216 --> 01:17:23.450
Bill: He is very smart,

01:17:23.452 --> 01:17:26.018
and he loves taking on attorneys.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.121
They got me to say what
they wanted to hear.

01:17:28.123 --> 01:17:31.090
And you know, I kind of...
I went back and forth.

01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:33.725
I was just kind of...
kind of a mess, honestly.

01:17:33.727 --> 01:17:35.862
I mean, I was lying
through my teeth, you know.

01:17:35.864 --> 01:17:38.697
Man: But you already had your deal.

01:17:38.699 --> 01:17:41.701
I had my deal, but as soon as I go
back on it, then they take my deal.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:44.103
As soon as I say something other than
I said in court, they can take it.

01:17:44.105 --> 01:17:45.705
That's what my plea agreement says.

01:17:45.707 --> 01:17:49.975
Man: Well, that's no different today
than it was on January 25, 2006.

01:17:49.977 --> 01:17:52.578
Because you have chosen not
to take my plea agreement.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.881
because if you take my plea
agreement and say I committed perjury,

01:17:55.883 --> 01:17:57.716
then you're admitting he
didn't get a fair trial.

01:17:57.718 --> 01:17:59.719
That's why, man. That's
why you haven't taken it.

01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:02.621
You're not gonna do it until...
until after this is done with

01:18:02.623 --> 01:18:03.956
because that hurts your case.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.558
Erickson: I don't trust prosecutors

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.193
or cops anymore at all.

01:18:07.195 --> 01:18:09.962
And, you know, I don't expect
people to believe me today...

01:18:09.964 --> 01:18:11.730
Man: I... I didn't ask for a speech.

01:18:11.732 --> 01:18:13.733
I just asked you to answer
the question, OK, sir?

01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:15.134
Ryan, voice-over: He does have issues.

01:18:15.136 --> 01:18:17.871
He did make things up, he did lie,

01:18:17.873 --> 01:18:19.872
but why did he do it?

01:18:19.874 --> 01:18:21.875
If you look at why he did it,

01:18:21.877 --> 01:18:24.109
he was lied to, he was
threatened, he was manipulated.

01:18:24.111 --> 01:18:27.779
I mean, the kid was abused, severely.

01:18:27.781 --> 01:18:30.183
Mentally, the anguish
that he had dealt with

01:18:30.185 --> 01:18:33.519
and he continues to deal
with... it must be incredible.

01:18:33.521 --> 01:18:36.688
I'm possibly facing the
rest of my life in prison,

01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:39.692
and that's something that... that I accept.

01:18:39.694 --> 01:18:41.960
And maybe, you know, I
deserve that for lying

01:18:41.962 --> 01:18:44.964
because, you know, I basically sold my soul

01:18:44.966 --> 01:18:47.966
uh, to save myself, and,

01:18:47.968 --> 01:18:50.303
[voice breaking] uh, maybe
that's what I deserve.

01:18:50.305 --> 01:18:52.138
Erickson: Uh, ahem.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.139
I don't want to die, you know,

01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:59.447
knowing that, uh, I di...
I did the wrong thing.

01:19:02.217 --> 01:19:04.983
Bill, voice-over: Kathleen
sent her investigator,

01:19:04.985 --> 01:19:07.886
her chief investigator to...
to interview Jerry Trump,

01:19:07.888 --> 01:19:09.889
and he was reluctant to start out with.

01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:13.893
But he realized that... that
we would ultimately end up

01:19:13.895 --> 01:19:17.897
calling his wife to testify,
and if... and if we did,

01:19:17.899 --> 01:19:20.899
then... then that would
show that he was lying,

01:19:20.901 --> 01:19:22.902
so he might as well come
forth and tell the truth.

01:19:22.904 --> 01:19:25.037
Zellner: I did talk to Trump
the night before he testified

01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:27.307
'cause he was starting to waver.

01:19:27.309 --> 01:19:31.210
Um... and he'd just
converted to being a Mormon,

01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:33.845
and I told him my
grandmother was a Mormon, um,

01:19:33.847 --> 01:19:36.249
and I told him he had to do this.

01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:38.885
As a human being, he had to do this.

01:19:38.887 --> 01:19:42.322
Zellner: So, does a meeting take place

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:44.624
with Mr. Crane and Mr. Haws?

01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:45.591
Yes, it does.

01:19:45.593 --> 01:19:46.960
Zellner: When you enter the office,

01:19:46.962 --> 01:19:48.260
do you make any statements?

01:19:48.262 --> 01:19:49.228
Trump: No.

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:52.031
And what does Mr. Crane tell you?

01:19:52.033 --> 01:19:54.800
He said, "We're... we're fairly sure

01:19:54.802 --> 01:19:56.368
"we have the... the two guys

01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:58.203
"that killed Mr. Heitholt,

01:19:58.205 --> 01:20:00.840
and we need you to identify them,"

01:20:00.842 --> 01:20:03.009
and he was pointing to a newspaper.

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:06.011
Zellner: When you were
shown the newspaper article,

01:20:06.013 --> 01:20:08.014
did you, on your own,

01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:10.916
recognize these two faces

01:20:10.918 --> 01:20:13.286
as the faces you'd seen at
the "Columbia Tribune"...

01:20:13.288 --> 01:20:15.020
No.

01:20:15.022 --> 01:20:17.023
I... I felt very intimidated

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:19.291
'cause... the only thing I wanted to do

01:20:19.293 --> 01:20:22.060
at that point was to do the right thing.

01:20:22.062 --> 01:20:24.063
I'd been in enough trouble.

01:20:24.065 --> 01:20:25.764
Bill, voice-over: There he
is in the prosecutor's office,

01:20:25.766 --> 01:20:27.767
with two years of probation

01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:30.902
hanging over his head like a guillotine.

01:20:30.904 --> 01:20:32.304
He was scared to death,

01:20:32.306 --> 01:20:34.941
and Crane kind of misled him by saying,

01:20:34.943 --> 01:20:36.943
uh, "We just want you to confirm

01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:39.077
"that that was Ryan
Ferguson in the parking lot.

01:20:39.079 --> 01:20:41.214
You probably won't even
be called as a witness."

01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:43.816
But, of course, we know differently now.

01:20:43.818 --> 01:20:46.285
Zellner: When you testify in the case,

01:20:46.287 --> 01:20:48.888
you tell the jury

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:51.890
that you received the article

01:20:51.892 --> 01:20:53.893
I've just handed you

01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:55.661
from your wife.

01:20:55.663 --> 01:20:56.795
Is that correct?

01:20:56.797 --> 01:20:57.764
- That's correct.
- OK.

01:20:57.766 --> 01:21:00.032
And is that true or is that false?

01:21:00.034 --> 01:21:01.067
That's false.

01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:03.236
Trump: I told them that I'd received it

01:21:03.238 --> 01:21:05.004
in the mail, and when I saw it,

01:21:05.006 --> 01:21:07.773
I recognized the two from behind the car.

01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:09.408
Zellner: Did you tell the jury

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:13.179
that you saw the headline
on the article first?

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:16.448
No. I told them I saw the pictures first.

01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:20.085
And why would... did... you
say you didn't see the article,

01:21:20.087 --> 01:21:22.688
so why were you telling them

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:25.692
that you saw the pictures

01:21:25.694 --> 01:21:27.326
before you saw the headline?

01:21:27.328 --> 01:21:30.095
The way... because of... I told them that's

01:21:30.097 --> 01:21:32.230
the way it was folded when I first saw it.

01:21:32.232 --> 01:21:34.367
My eyes went to that... those pictures.

01:21:34.369 --> 01:21:35.968
And did you make that up

01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.969
or did someone else make that story up?

01:21:37.971 --> 01:21:39.738
Someone else did.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.307
And who was that?

01:21:41.309 --> 01:21:43.876
Be Kevin Crane.

01:21:43.878 --> 01:21:46.278
And when you pointed to Ryan Ferguson

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.747
in the courtroom and you said that's

01:21:48.749 --> 01:21:52.919
the person you saw at the
"Columbia Tribune" parking lot,

01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:54.920
was that true or false?

01:21:54.922 --> 01:21:56.324
It was false.

01:22:02.463 --> 01:22:05.932
Bill, voice-over: My feelings
when he said those words was

01:22:05.934 --> 01:22:09.035
total relief, total vindication,

01:22:09.037 --> 01:22:12.404
and "My God, why couldn't
this have happened sooner?"

01:22:12.406 --> 01:22:15.407
Zellner: Are you testifying
with the understanding that,

01:22:15.409 --> 01:22:19.211
by telling this testimony, you
could be charged with perjury?

01:22:19.213 --> 01:22:21.149
Yes, I am.

01:22:23.752 --> 01:22:26.152
Zellner: Do you anticipate

01:22:26.154 --> 01:22:29.257
or want anything for doing this?

01:22:30.758 --> 01:22:32.157
Yes.

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:33.893
[Voice breaking] I'd like to have

01:22:33.895 --> 01:22:37.462
forgiveness... [gasps]... from Ryan

01:22:37.464 --> 01:22:41.466
and his... [sniffles]...

01:22:41.468 --> 01:22:44.303
and his family.

01:22:44.305 --> 01:22:47.907
Zellner: I don't have any further...

01:22:47.909 --> 01:22:50.076
Ryan, voice-over: You can
see the stress that he's been

01:22:50.078 --> 01:22:52.178
dealing with for years,

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.316
knowing that he could
be destroying his life.

01:22:56.383 --> 01:22:59.687
How can you not respect a person for that?

01:23:01.388 --> 01:23:03.889
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:05.457
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:23:05.459 --> 01:23:06.459
- I do.
- Judge,

01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:08.861
let me make a little inquiry of you.

01:23:08.863 --> 01:23:09.961
Do you prefer to be addressed

01:23:09.963 --> 01:23:12.465
by... as "Judge Crane"
as we sit here today?

01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:15.201
Uh, whatever, uh... I
won't be offended by...

01:23:15.203 --> 01:23:17.469
I will call you "Judge Crane"
because that's what you were

01:23:17.471 --> 01:23:20.238
when I was a practicing
attorney, but, uh, I'll

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.009
direct counsel to refer to
the witness as "Judge Crane,"

01:23:23.011 --> 01:23:25.010
even though we all know he was a judge

01:23:25.012 --> 01:23:27.013
at the time of the events in question.

01:23:27.015 --> 01:23:28.113
Thank you.

01:23:28.115 --> 01:23:30.817
Bill, voice-over: If Prosecutor Crane knew

01:23:30.819 --> 01:23:32.285
that Jerry Trump was lying,

01:23:32.287 --> 01:23:34.452
and you put him on the witness stand,

01:23:34.454 --> 01:23:38.191
that is a gross violation
of the federal law.

01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:40.326
Man: When Mr. Trump came
to your office, how did you

01:23:40.328 --> 01:23:43.228
first become aware that
Mr. Trump might, in fact,

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:45.096
be able to identify the two individuals

01:23:45.098 --> 01:23:46.832
that murdered Mr. Heitholt?

01:23:46.834 --> 01:23:48.835
Mr. Trump's in the doorway

01:23:48.837 --> 01:23:51.103
of my office and, you know,

01:23:51.105 --> 01:23:54.105
"Hey, how you doing? Nice to meet you."

01:23:54.107 --> 01:23:56.876
And unsolicited,

01:23:56.878 --> 01:23:59.444
very soon into the conversation,

01:23:59.446 --> 01:24:01.013
he said,

01:24:01.015 --> 01:24:04.250
"I think I can identify these guys."

01:24:04.252 --> 01:24:07.519
Man: Did you show Mr. Trump
this newspaper that day?

01:24:07.521 --> 01:24:09.121
Absolutely not.

01:24:09.123 --> 01:24:11.122
Zellner, voice-over: Jerry Trump said

01:24:11.124 --> 01:24:14.393
that Kevin Crane came up
with the newspaper story,

01:24:14.395 --> 01:24:17.996
so a prosecutor cannot fabricate evidence.

01:24:17.998 --> 01:24:21.000
So I thought that he needed to testify

01:24:21.002 --> 01:24:23.001
and address those issues.

01:24:23.003 --> 01:24:25.004
Zellner: Would it be a
fair statement to say,

01:24:25.006 --> 01:24:27.005
as part of being a diligent prosecutor,

01:24:27.007 --> 01:24:30.142
if there was another witness
out there that could identify

01:24:30.144 --> 01:24:32.277
these individuals, you certainly wanted

01:24:32.279 --> 01:24:36.448
to... have that witness testify?

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:38.451
Truthfully.

01:24:38.453 --> 01:24:39.385
Truth... exactly.

01:24:39.387 --> 01:24:42.621
Not try to get them to say more

01:24:42.623 --> 01:24:44.624
than what they knew...

01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:46.224
by any means.

01:24:46.226 --> 01:24:48.493
It was a tough case, I'll admit that,

01:24:48.495 --> 01:24:51.363
but I wasn't going, "Golly, I've got this

01:24:51.365 --> 01:24:53.366
"and this, and that's not great, so we got

01:24:53.368 --> 01:24:57.002
to get Jerry to lie,"
risk my entire career,

01:24:57.004 --> 01:24:59.138
maybe go to prison, suborning perjury

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.139
with a guy that just got out of prison

01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:02.575
that I've never met before.

01:25:02.577 --> 01:25:04.175
Zellner: He tells you

01:25:04.177 --> 01:25:07.179
that he's received an article

01:25:07.181 --> 01:25:10.182
from his wife in prison, right?

01:25:10.184 --> 01:25:12.050
- Right.
- OK.

01:25:12.052 --> 01:25:14.920
And the article was in an envelope?

01:25:14.922 --> 01:25:16.054
I thought so.

01:25:16.056 --> 01:25:17.924
OK, because he describes...

01:25:17.926 --> 01:25:20.225
- I thought that's what he said.
- He describes

01:25:20.227 --> 01:25:22.094
at trial the article was folded inside...

01:25:22.096 --> 01:25:23.094
I remember something about that, yeah.

01:25:23.096 --> 01:25:25.997
Right. In fact, he was so specific,

01:25:25.999 --> 01:25:28.134
um, he even testified

01:25:28.136 --> 01:25:30.702
that the, uh, fold

01:25:30.704 --> 01:25:33.706
was between the two pictures.

01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:35.707
OK.

01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:38.310
Do... do you kind of recall that?

01:25:38.312 --> 01:25:41.447
I... if... if that's
what the record reflects,

01:25:41.449 --> 01:25:42.615
I'm not going to disagree with you.

01:25:42.617 --> 01:25:44.483
Zellner: Well, it... it...
it mattered in that...

01:25:44.485 --> 01:25:47.219
that it was folded, um, so that

01:25:47.221 --> 01:25:49.988
he would not have seen the... the headline

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:52.524
"Tip leads to murder arrest"?

01:25:52.526 --> 01:25:55.126
What do you mean, "Did it matter?"

01:25:55.128 --> 01:25:58.229
Let me show it to you so you're
not... kind of see it more.

01:25:58.231 --> 01:26:00.633
It's actually folded in a way

01:26:00.635 --> 01:26:03.702
where he doesn't see the headline,

01:26:03.704 --> 01:26:05.136
he sees the photographs.

01:26:05.138 --> 01:26:06.304
Do you recall that?

01:26:06.306 --> 01:26:07.572
- OK.
- And so

01:26:07.574 --> 01:26:10.209
it makes that a better identification

01:26:10.211 --> 01:26:12.044
if he doesn't know these are the people

01:26:12.046 --> 01:26:14.346
that have been arrested for
the murder, wouldn't you agree?

01:26:14.348 --> 01:26:16.482
You could make that argument.

01:26:16.484 --> 01:26:19.652
Well, that is the argument that was made.

01:26:19.654 --> 01:26:20.987
By...?

01:26:20.989 --> 01:26:23.389
By Mr. Trump when he testified.

01:26:23.391 --> 01:26:26.125
- OK.
- If, in fact,

01:26:26.127 --> 01:26:28.260
you were the one who had shown

01:26:28.262 --> 01:26:29.661
Mr. Trump the article...

01:26:29.663 --> 01:26:31.429
I know you're denying you did that...

01:26:31.431 --> 01:26:33.198
but that would defeat
the argument 'cause then

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.904
you'd have this governmental involvement.

01:26:37.204 --> 01:26:39.205
Well, yeah, if I did

01:26:39.207 --> 01:26:41.206
what you're accusing me of doing...

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:43.341
- No, no, Mr. Trump...
- of going in and saying...

01:26:43.343 --> 01:26:44.609
well, it's in your petition.

01:26:44.611 --> 01:26:47.412
- Right, well, it's Mr. Trump's.
- Saying, "Hi, Jerry,

01:26:47.414 --> 01:26:50.015
"I know you've never seen this before.

01:26:50.017 --> 01:26:51.416
Here's what I need you to do."

01:26:51.418 --> 01:26:53.419
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
- "Perjure yourself,"

01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:55.054
I wouldn't have gotten it in

01:26:55.056 --> 01:26:56.455
and may have gone to prison myself.

01:26:56.457 --> 01:26:58.456
Right, but before we
have you going to prison,

01:26:58.458 --> 01:27:01.594
I'm just saying to you that...

01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:04.229
it was very important to your argument

01:27:04.231 --> 01:27:06.499
that no governmental authority...

01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:09.135
and you mentioned it numerous
times in the transcript...

01:27:09.137 --> 01:27:11.403
showed Mr. Trump the article.

01:27:11.405 --> 01:27:13.104
- OK, I'll agree with you.
- You would agree with that.

01:27:13.106 --> 01:27:14.439
- Right.
- Right? OK.

01:27:14.441 --> 01:27:17.042
Zellner: All right, I don't
have any further questions.

01:27:17.044 --> 01:27:19.310
Zellner, voice-over: At the
end of the habeas hearing,

01:27:19.312 --> 01:27:23.314
I knew that we had won the case,

01:27:23.316 --> 01:27:26.085
and I knew that Ryan would be released.

01:27:26.087 --> 01:27:28.487
There was no case in America

01:27:28.489 --> 01:27:31.389
where two witnesses in
open court have admitted

01:27:31.391 --> 01:27:33.392
committing perjury at the trial,

01:27:33.394 --> 01:27:35.161
and they're the only two witnesses.

01:27:35.163 --> 01:27:37.196
No case. It's never happened before.

01:27:37.198 --> 01:27:40.499
At the very minimum, this
young man deserves a new trial.

01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:43.501
I mean, if you're going to
believe in the system at all,

01:27:43.503 --> 01:27:46.505
you don't want to believe that a 29-,

01:27:46.507 --> 01:27:49.508
almost 30-year-old
young man is in...

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:51.777
in prison for the rest
of his life when there's

01:27:51.779 --> 01:27:55.350
absolutely no credible
evidence to tie him to it.

01:27:57.284 --> 01:28:00.853
Ryan, voice-over: They can take
your freedom, they can take...

01:28:00.855 --> 01:28:03.188
your food, they can take
your clothes, they can take...

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:06.325
they can take you and put
you in a cell with nothing.

01:28:06.327 --> 01:28:10.629
And I'll think about different
books that I've read, and they

01:28:10.631 --> 01:28:13.765
can't take my mind, they can't
take my body, no matter what.

01:28:13.767 --> 01:28:16.501
All you've got to do is pick
up a book, and you're invited

01:28:16.503 --> 01:28:18.504
into this cerebral world.

01:28:18.506 --> 01:28:22.241
When I was in the county jail,
I read close to a hundred books.

01:28:22.243 --> 01:28:24.410
You know, I'd read a book
every 3 days, and I read all

01:28:24.412 --> 01:28:27.679
the Grishams and Sidney
Sheldon, Ken Follett,

01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:29.682
"The Old Man and the
Sea"... I read that as well.

01:28:29.684 --> 01:28:32.283
To me, the best book that I
have read in the past few years,

01:28:32.285 --> 01:28:35.220
and I just stumbled upon it in
the library, was Hemingway...

01:28:35.222 --> 01:28:36.621
"For Whom the Bell Tolls."

01:28:36.623 --> 01:28:39.390
Picked it up and I read
the first paragraph.

01:28:39.392 --> 01:28:42.228
He was in the mountains
and he was in Spain,

01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:44.529
and he was looking down on this
road and he was talking about

01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:46.799
how, like, it was like black
ink going through the mountains.

01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:48.533
You know, it was beautiful, and I was like,

01:28:48.535 --> 01:28:49.734
"I've got to read this book."

01:28:49.736 --> 01:28:53.572
You know, I mean, you
need somewhere else to go,

01:28:53.574 --> 01:28:57.542
and for some reason, words do that for me.

01:28:57.544 --> 01:28:59.545
I know I'm not going to be here forever.

01:28:59.547 --> 01:29:03.148
I know I'm going to prove
my innocence, and I feel like

01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:06.152
I can sit here and waste my life,

01:29:06.154 --> 01:29:09.420
waste all the efforts
of my family and everyone

01:29:09.422 --> 01:29:11.557
who cares about me and
everyone in the justice system

01:29:11.559 --> 01:29:13.559
who would get this overturned

01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:16.664
if I didn't prepare
myself for when I get out.

01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:33.578
Zellner: My associate Nick
was walking down the hall

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:36.581
and he said, "Oh, we got Green's opinion,"

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:39.451
and I could tell in his voice we'd lost.

01:29:39.453 --> 01:29:42.453
And I just... I couldn't even stand up.

01:29:42.455 --> 01:29:45.858
It was just like, "God," you know?

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.461
It was like, "Could...
this is America," you know?

01:29:50.463 --> 01:29:53.198
It was, um... I was so angry with him,

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.502
I felt like calling him and
saying, "You're a disgrace.

01:29:57.504 --> 01:29:59.904
You're a disgrace to this profession."

01:29:59.906 --> 01:30:04.309
But then I thought, "No, I
will take the opinion apart.

01:30:04.311 --> 01:30:06.844
"I will do this and I will take it apart,

01:30:06.846 --> 01:30:09.747
"and I will show the world
that you are incompetent,

01:30:09.749 --> 01:30:12.684
and that'll be my revenge."

01:30:12.686 --> 01:30:16.487
He rendered his decision on
the anniversary of the murder.

01:30:16.489 --> 01:30:18.490
We thought that was a little odd.

01:30:18.492 --> 01:30:22.361
I mean... I think we
were all just in shock.

01:30:22.363 --> 01:30:23.661
Judge Green basically said

01:30:23.663 --> 01:30:25.930
Charles Erickson had no credibility

01:30:25.932 --> 01:30:28.567
because he'd changed his story 3 times,

01:30:28.569 --> 01:30:31.002
and Jerry Trump's recantation

01:30:31.004 --> 01:30:32.837
meant nothing to the jury,

01:30:32.839 --> 01:30:35.374
would have had no effect
on them whatsoever.

01:30:35.376 --> 01:30:37.509
Having to call Ryan and tell him that,

01:30:37.511 --> 01:30:38.911
it was bad. I mean...

01:30:38.913 --> 01:30:41.246
and it wasn't me, it was having to tell him

01:30:41.248 --> 01:30:44.282
'cause he... he just, like, kind of gasped.

01:30:44.284 --> 01:30:46.318
He couldn't really talk.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.319
I'm trying to... I'm
trying to talk, like, say,

01:30:48.321 --> 01:30:50.488
"Well, we could try this, we"...
and I thought... [scoffs]...

01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:52.457
this is just like telling somebody,

01:30:52.459 --> 01:30:55.760
"You know that cancer you've
got? Well, it is gonna kill you.

01:30:55.762 --> 01:30:59.233
This isn't gonna work. We're
not gonna take you home."

01:31:00.668 --> 01:31:02.934
It was pretty upsetting, upsetting.

01:31:02.936 --> 01:31:05.437
But that's why we always want to have

01:31:05.439 --> 01:31:07.939
a backup plan, that counterpunch.

01:31:07.941 --> 01:31:10.675
Just like playing basketball,
you get knocked down,

01:31:10.677 --> 01:31:12.478
you got to get right back up again.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.045
That's always our mentality...

01:31:14.047 --> 01:31:15.179
we're never gonna give up,

01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:18.483
playing basketball or
being at a... at a trial.

01:31:18.485 --> 01:31:21.653
We just don't have that kind...
we just don't think like that.

01:31:21.655 --> 01:31:23.788
And so it may... it may hurt,

01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:25.791
you may get the breath knocked out of you,

01:31:25.793 --> 01:31:28.559
but you got to get right back
up and you got to continue on.

01:31:28.561 --> 01:31:31.498
You've got to complete the mission.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.968
Bill: We had already
contacted a billboard company

01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:38.569
to create a billboard

01:31:38.571 --> 01:31:41.807
in the event that the
verdict would go against us.

01:31:41.809 --> 01:31:44.410
And so, when that verdict came down,

01:31:44.412 --> 01:31:45.978
two days later,

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.580
the billboard went up

01:31:48.582 --> 01:31:51.082
to show that "you haven't knocked us out.

01:31:51.084 --> 01:31:54.719
"We are still fighting,
we're now in full pursuit

01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:57.790
of identifying that person
that was behind the car."

01:31:57.792 --> 01:32:00.559
We know it wasn't Ryan,
and we know it wasn't Chuck.

01:32:00.561 --> 01:32:02.960
It's this person, the... the composite

01:32:02.962 --> 01:32:06.965
that Shawna Ornt drew, so we
could demonstrate to the public,

01:32:06.967 --> 01:32:09.335
to the prosecutor, to the Attorney General

01:32:09.337 --> 01:32:11.306
that we had not given up.

01:32:14.475 --> 01:32:16.841
Bill: The social media started with Kelly,

01:32:16.843 --> 01:32:18.844
so she kind of got it started.

01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:22.480
It took off slowly, started
building up momentum,

01:32:22.482 --> 01:32:24.483
and each succeeding month,

01:32:24.485 --> 01:32:26.085
it, uh, increased.

01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:27.286
And then we started figuring out

01:32:27.288 --> 01:32:30.923
different things that we
could do, to, uh, images

01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:33.559
and photographs and, uh, telling the story.

01:32:33.561 --> 01:32:35.893
We wrote the narrative
and rewrote the narrative,

01:32:35.895 --> 01:32:38.697
and then we started creating YouTubes.

01:32:38.699 --> 01:32:41.466
Leslie: That was just so reassuring,

01:32:41.468 --> 01:32:45.504
to know that people were there for us,

01:32:45.506 --> 01:32:48.540
and I think that's...

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:51.844
that's kind of grown into
people then that we don't know,

01:32:51.846 --> 01:32:54.880
so there's people all over
the world who have written

01:32:54.882 --> 01:32:57.148
and say, you know,
"What can we do to help?"

01:32:57.150 --> 01:33:00.385
It's so nice that people would do that.

01:33:00.387 --> 01:33:03.389
Ryan: I've never been on it,
I've never used it myself,

01:33:03.391 --> 01:33:05.523
I've never sent a text.
I know that there's...

01:33:05.525 --> 01:33:07.960
you know, right now we have
50,000 people on the Facebook

01:33:07.962 --> 01:33:10.429
and 100,000 people signed the petition,

01:33:10.431 --> 01:33:13.301
but I... I don't think I
can grasp the concept of it.

01:33:34.555 --> 01:33:36.290
[Applause]

01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:40.125
Bill, voice-over: I
mean, this corrupt person

01:33:40.127 --> 01:33:41.893
is... is going to be
the commencement speaker?

01:33:41.895 --> 01:33:45.365
That's the best the
university could do? Wow.

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:54.907
Wait a second.

01:33:54.909 --> 01:33:57.108
Why don't we fly a plane
with a banner saying,

01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:00.981
"Free Ryan Ferguson," fly that
around the campus for a while?

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:05.117
We got a lot of publicity over that.

01:34:05.119 --> 01:34:07.752
But we didn't just do
it over the commencement;

01:34:07.754 --> 01:34:10.154
we did it during the...
the homecoming football game

01:34:10.156 --> 01:34:13.157
and over the St. Louis
Cardinals baseball team.

01:34:13.159 --> 01:34:15.160
Zellner: Some people said,
"Oh, my gosh, you know,

01:34:15.162 --> 01:34:18.563
he's kind of gone around
the bend, he's"... you know.

01:34:18.565 --> 01:34:21.599
I... I... I just think
it's amazing what he's done.

01:34:21.601 --> 01:34:23.001
TV announcer: You're watching ABC17,

01:34:23.003 --> 01:34:25.636
KMIZ, where the news comes first.

01:34:25.638 --> 01:34:28.072
Convicted killer Ryan
Ferguson once again tries

01:34:28.074 --> 01:34:29.541
to win his freedom.

01:34:29.543 --> 01:34:30.809
Ferguson is serving 40 years

01:34:30.811 --> 01:34:32.577
in prison for the 2001 murder

01:34:32.579 --> 01:34:34.580
of "Tribune" sports editor Kent Heitholt.

01:34:34.582 --> 01:34:35.747
Now the decision is in the hands

01:34:35.749 --> 01:34:38.418
of the Western District
Court in Kansas City.

01:34:39.887 --> 01:34:42.888
Bill: Any Circuit Court
decision can be appealed,

01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:44.889
and the next level of appeal

01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:46.892
would be the Western District Court.

01:34:46.894 --> 01:34:48.893
And if you don't like the
Western District Court,

01:34:48.895 --> 01:34:51.496
then you can appeal to
the Missouri Supreme Court,

01:34:51.498 --> 01:34:53.031
and, of course, if you don't
like that, well, you just

01:34:53.033 --> 01:34:55.032
keep on going all the way
up to the Supreme Court.

01:34:55.034 --> 01:34:57.169
In fact, I'd already
looked into what's involved

01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:59.036
in going to the World Court.

01:34:59.038 --> 01:35:03.041
When you appeal a Circuit
Court judge's decision

01:35:03.043 --> 01:35:06.511
in a habeas case, then the next appeal

01:35:06.513 --> 01:35:09.648
that's available to you
would be the oral argument.

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.050
You have to come up
with your best argument,

01:35:12.052 --> 01:35:14.952
and then they give you, uh, 15 minutes.

01:35:14.954 --> 01:35:17.555
Zellner: You have to spend hours on it

01:35:17.557 --> 01:35:20.125
because you don't know
which piece of evidence

01:35:20.127 --> 01:35:25.031
they're going to focus on,
so we filed a 160-page brief.

01:35:26.534 --> 01:35:30.768
Zellner: It's taken us 3
years to dismantle this case,

01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.804
and we're still not totally
sure what they're going to do.

01:35:33.806 --> 01:35:35.809
It shouldn't be that difficult.

01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:39.710
Ryan: Fortunately, my
roomie is at work, you know,

01:35:39.712 --> 01:35:44.015
so I have the cell to myself,
and it... it's surreal knowing

01:35:44.017 --> 01:35:47.786
that all these people are
converging in... on Kansas City,

01:35:47.788 --> 01:35:51.023
essentially, just to have
a hearing about my life

01:35:51.025 --> 01:35:53.024
and what's going to happen next in my life.

01:35:53.026 --> 01:35:55.928
Woman: There are other claims
asserted in this habeas pleading

01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:57.696
that, uh, relate to certain

01:35:57.698 --> 01:35:59.331
claimed constitutional violations.

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:02.099
Zellner: That's correct, and
those are the... the claims

01:36:02.101 --> 01:36:04.870
that we raised under our Brady violation.

01:36:04.872 --> 01:36:07.639
The judge, Judge Roper,
was informed there had been

01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:10.642
no state involvement in...

01:36:10.644 --> 01:36:13.045
in the Mr. Trump identification,

01:36:13.047 --> 01:36:17.683
that he had simply come to
Prosecutor Crane's office

01:36:17.685 --> 01:36:19.952
and walked in the door and told them

01:36:19.954 --> 01:36:22.219
he'd seen this newspaper article.

01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:26.692
So the Brady violation is
the fact that it was concealed

01:36:26.694 --> 01:36:29.861
from the defense that there had
been government involvement...

01:36:29.863 --> 01:36:31.996
Bill, voice-over: She was able to show

01:36:31.998 --> 01:36:35.000
that there was all these Brady
violations, and that means

01:36:35.002 --> 01:36:38.370
that Prosecutor Crane and,
uh, and his lieutenants

01:36:38.372 --> 01:36:42.006
had hidden that evidence;
evidence so strong

01:36:42.008 --> 01:36:45.010
that it would change the...
the opinion of a jury.

01:36:45.012 --> 01:36:48.613
That is a direct violation
of the Constitution.

01:36:48.615 --> 01:36:49.782
Judge: Thank you, counsel.

01:36:49.784 --> 01:36:51.250
Zellner: Thank you. It
was an honor to appear.

01:36:51.252 --> 01:36:55.823
Judge: The case is now submitted
and the court will be in recess.

01:36:57.123 --> 01:37:00.024
Zellner: The whole way you
advance as a prosecutor is

01:37:00.026 --> 01:37:02.294
getting convictions;
it's all about winning.

01:37:02.296 --> 01:37:05.663
Zellner: A prosecutor
can fabricate testimony.

01:37:05.665 --> 01:37:07.799
He can put on perjured testimony.

01:37:07.801 --> 01:37:11.370
He can pretty much do
whatever he wants to do,

01:37:11.372 --> 01:37:14.206
and he has absolute immunity.

01:37:14.208 --> 01:37:17.108
Imagine going to work every day knowing

01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:21.846
that you could pretty much
do whatever you want to win.

01:37:21.848 --> 01:37:24.750
The entire hearing was focused on the idea

01:37:24.752 --> 01:37:27.385
that the state withheld material,

01:37:27.387 --> 01:37:30.322
uh, information and
evidence from the defense.

01:37:30.324 --> 01:37:31.590
That is Brady.

01:37:31.592 --> 01:37:34.925
That is really one of the
most important reasons why

01:37:34.927 --> 01:37:37.763
cases are overturned, um,
so I would have to say,

01:37:37.765 --> 01:37:40.197
in all the years I've covered
this case, this has been

01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:43.902
the most positive
hearing for Ryan Ferguson.

01:37:43.904 --> 01:37:45.437
Really, I don't have
too many opportunities.

01:37:45.439 --> 01:37:47.938
I don't have many chances;
like, this is... this is it.

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:50.675
My... my whole life
really is gonna be decided

01:37:50.677 --> 01:37:52.678
within the next 6 months.

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.080
I mean, if I'm here in 6 months,

01:37:55.082 --> 01:37:57.215
I'll be here in... in 6 years.

01:37:57.217 --> 01:38:01.353
Bill: We go outside, and CBS, NBC,

01:38:01.355 --> 01:38:04.188
all the local affiliates
are there, filming.

01:38:04.190 --> 01:38:06.224
I knew that was going to happen,

01:38:06.226 --> 01:38:08.960
and then I would have
the car brought around,

01:38:08.962 --> 01:38:11.697
illegally parked right in front.

01:38:11.699 --> 01:38:15.169
And of course, people would
go, "Oh, my gosh! What is that?"

01:38:25.345 --> 01:38:28.246
Bill: The idea was that
we would meet people,

01:38:28.248 --> 01:38:30.247
hand out T-shirts, brochures,

01:38:30.249 --> 01:38:32.250
or what happens to be, and
then we'd put it on Facebook.

01:38:32.252 --> 01:38:34.452
Every place we went, put it
on Facebook, so now people are

01:38:34.454 --> 01:38:37.354
following us across the country,
then they would... they would get

01:38:37.356 --> 01:38:39.124
on the Facebook and
they would make comments:

01:38:39.126 --> 01:38:41.393
"We just passed the Ryan Ferguson car!"

01:38:41.395 --> 01:38:44.862
Ryan, voice-over: When I get
out of this place and I walk out,

01:38:44.864 --> 01:38:47.131
I just... the number-one
thing I want to do is

01:38:47.133 --> 01:38:50.135
just hug my family, especially
my mother and my father

01:38:50.137 --> 01:38:53.307
for... everything that they've done.

01:38:55.309 --> 01:38:57.809
Leslie: Hi. Would you like a
pamphlet about my son's case?

01:38:57.811 --> 01:38:59.077
Thank you.

01:38:59.079 --> 01:39:01.011
Ryan: It just makes me want
to do really good things

01:39:01.013 --> 01:39:02.013
for my parents when I get out, you know?

01:39:02.015 --> 01:39:04.816
Like, I don't give a damn what I do.

01:39:04.818 --> 01:39:06.017
I don't care what I have in life.

01:39:06.019 --> 01:39:08.987
I want to make sure that,
you know, I give them

01:39:08.989 --> 01:39:10.421
what they need for the rest of their lives.

01:39:10.423 --> 01:39:13.023
Whatever they want, you know,
I'm going to be there for them.

01:39:13.025 --> 01:39:14.859
In 20, 30 years, if they
got problems, I'll change

01:39:14.861 --> 01:39:17.062
their diaper, you know? I don't
care; that's what I'm doing

01:39:17.064 --> 01:39:18.964
because my parents have
been changing my diapers

01:39:18.966 --> 01:39:20.831
for 10 years, you know? Heh!

01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:24.135
Hi, folks. Can I give you
a business card for my son?

01:39:24.137 --> 01:39:25.536
Now, you don't... it's not anything to buy.

01:39:25.538 --> 01:39:27.304
- No, that's OK.
- It's just a... it's just a...

01:39:27.306 --> 01:39:29.307
it's just an awareness
thing. You take one yet?

01:39:29.309 --> 01:39:30.977
- No.
- OK.

01:39:32.512 --> 01:39:35.781
Hello. Can I give you a
business card for my son?

01:39:35.783 --> 01:39:37.048
- No, thanks.
- OK.

01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:38.884
Excuse me, sir. Give you a card?

01:39:38.886 --> 01:39:40.050
It's for my son who's in prison,

01:39:40.052 --> 01:39:41.185
and, uh...

01:39:41.187 --> 01:39:42.787
Oh, I've seen the car.

01:39:42.789 --> 01:39:44.355
- You've seen the car?
- I've seen the car.

01:39:44.357 --> 01:39:45.991
We saw it over there by the, um...

01:39:45.993 --> 01:39:47.526
- Cool!
- the Lincoln Memorial.

01:39:47.528 --> 01:39:49.730
That's right. That...
we just came from there.

01:39:51.198 --> 01:39:54.068
[Cell phone ringtone playing]

01:39:56.203 --> 01:39:58.202
Recording: Thank you for using Evercom.

01:39:58.204 --> 01:39:59.537
- Hey, Ryan.
- What up?

01:39:59.539 --> 01:40:00.906
Hey, man. How you doing?

01:40:00.908 --> 01:40:02.072
Ryan: Good. How you doing?

01:40:02.074 --> 01:40:03.073
Well, good.

01:40:03.075 --> 01:40:06.277
Well, um, your call is very timely.

01:40:06.279 --> 01:40:07.345
Why?

01:40:07.347 --> 01:40:09.447
You... you'll never believe where we are.

01:40:09.449 --> 01:40:11.383
Hello? [Feedback]

01:40:11.385 --> 01:40:12.550
Ryan?

01:40:12.552 --> 01:40:14.553
Eh, I think I lost him.

01:40:14.555 --> 01:40:16.388
Yeah.

01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:18.889
Recording: Your caller has hung up.

01:40:18.891 --> 01:40:20.291
Yeah. [Busy signal]

01:40:20.293 --> 01:40:22.294
We just got cut off. That's it.

01:40:22.296 --> 01:40:25.165
That's really irritating.

01:40:50.257 --> 01:40:52.256
Bill: The day that we got the news,

01:40:52.258 --> 01:40:54.392
we were at the Tiger Hotel,

01:40:54.394 --> 01:40:56.995
being filmed by, uh, "48 Hours."

01:40:56.997 --> 01:41:00.398
Moriarty on TV: For two months,
Ryan's parents anxiously look

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.739
for a sign of the decision,
and then, on November 5th...

01:41:09.443 --> 01:41:12.611
All right. Should come up any moment.

01:41:12.613 --> 01:41:14.211
[Cell phone ringtone playing]

01:41:14.213 --> 01:41:15.880
My favorite attorney.

01:41:15.882 --> 01:41:17.948
Our favorite attorney. Kathleen?

01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:20.085
Today?!

01:41:20.087 --> 01:41:21.452
No way.

01:41:21.454 --> 01:41:24.089
J... just a second, just a
second. Let me put you on speaker.

01:41:24.091 --> 01:41:27.024
Zellner: What the order says
is they're ordering his release.

01:41:27.026 --> 01:41:29.361
- Whoa-ho!
- Do we know what time?

01:41:29.363 --> 01:41:31.962
Zellner: We're on the
way. Who cares what time?

01:41:31.964 --> 01:41:33.298
- Yeah, right.
- I'm so excited.

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.934
I think they're not ordering
him to go back to any court.

01:41:35.936 --> 01:41:37.102
- Good.
- They're saying

01:41:37.104 --> 01:41:38.402
he's to be discharged.

01:41:38.404 --> 01:41:40.572
I'm in shock. Awesome. Thank you.

01:41:40.574 --> 01:41:41.605
- Bye-bye.
- Yes. Bye.

01:41:41.607 --> 01:41:44.009
Whoo! It cannot get better than that!

01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:46.010
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha!

01:41:46.012 --> 01:41:47.578
Oh, my God.

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:48.947
Amazing.

01:41:48.949 --> 01:41:50.348
I mean, I never dreamed

01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:51.950
that they would actually rule.

01:41:51.952 --> 01:41:53.350
- My God. I... I...
- Amazing.

01:41:53.352 --> 01:41:55.519
I... it just takes my breath away.

01:41:55.521 --> 01:41:57.488
Nine and a half years!

01:41:57.490 --> 01:41:59.491
They... they put out their decision,

01:41:59.493 --> 01:42:02.493
and... and they ruled in Ryan's favor,

01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:05.697
and they ruled to vacate the conviction.

01:42:05.699 --> 01:42:07.098
[Sobs]

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.099
I mean, it's all good news.

01:42:09.101 --> 01:42:11.102
It's wonderful.

01:42:11.104 --> 01:42:13.103
Ha ha! [Sobs]

01:42:13.105 --> 01:42:16.107
And Zellner called,

01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:19.678
and she said Ryan will
probably be out today.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.583
Ha ha!

01:42:28.355 --> 01:42:30.487
Zellner: Uh, going to the jail.

01:42:30.489 --> 01:42:32.357
To the jail.

01:42:32.359 --> 01:42:34.559
We're going to get Ryan, and then

01:42:34.561 --> 01:42:37.161
we're going to have a press conference, so

01:42:37.163 --> 01:42:38.729
excuse me while I go get my son.

01:42:38.731 --> 01:42:41.135
- Yay!
- Thank you so much.

01:43:24.043 --> 01:43:26.546
[Shackles unclicking]

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:34.551
Mom.

01:43:34.553 --> 01:43:36.522
Ha ha ha!

01:43:38.557 --> 01:43:41.792
[Indistinct voice on walkie-talkie]

01:43:41.794 --> 01:43:43.329
Hey.

01:43:45.798 --> 01:43:46.997
- Oh.
- Awesome.

01:43:46.999 --> 01:43:50.434
Bill, voice-over: Oh, I
got my arms around him,

01:43:50.436 --> 01:43:54.438
and he's with us, and I...

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.309
he's not gonna go back.
I mean, he's finally free.

01:43:58.311 --> 01:44:00.144
[Crowd cheering]

01:44:00.146 --> 01:44:02.447
Zellner, voice-over: We got
two million people incarcerated,

01:44:02.449 --> 01:44:07.051
and we've got 20,000 people
locked up that are innocent,

01:44:07.053 --> 01:44:08.019
and that's conservative.

01:44:08.021 --> 01:44:11.121
I even believed more, uh, I think,

01:44:11.123 --> 01:44:13.124
in the good will of prosecutors

01:44:13.126 --> 01:44:14.358
and "people want to do the right thing,

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.127
and I can show them the
evidence and go to them."

01:44:17.129 --> 01:44:20.298
And I'd had that experience
up until this point,

01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.466
but this, this has been

01:44:22.468 --> 01:44:25.469
really disturbing at every level.

01:44:25.471 --> 01:44:28.007
[Cheering and applause]

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:31.843
Zellner, voice-over: I know
that a lot of people Ryan's age,

01:44:31.845 --> 01:44:33.844
they think, "Oh, this
could never happen to me."

01:44:33.846 --> 01:44:37.448
Trust me, this could
happen to you, absolutely.

01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:40.350
If you tell people that
two eyewitnesses put you

01:44:40.352 --> 01:44:42.754
at a murder scene, uh,
one of whom says that you

01:44:42.756 --> 01:44:46.357
committed the murder with him,
you're going down, you know?

01:44:46.359 --> 01:44:48.358
[Cheering and applause continue]

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.761
Bill, voice-over: To put
Ryan in an environment

01:44:50.763 --> 01:44:54.631
in which he could have
been killed any single day,

01:44:54.633 --> 01:44:59.504
to take away his life, uh,
all those years, for what?

01:44:59.506 --> 01:45:02.506
Until we become actively involved,

01:45:02.508 --> 01:45:05.346
then there will always be corruption.

01:45:12.385 --> 01:45:14.786
Bill: I cannot let go of it, you know?

01:45:14.788 --> 01:45:16.554
It's something I think I'm pretty good at.

01:45:16.556 --> 01:45:20.558
I mean, it's a skill that I... I didn't...

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.562
imagine that I would ever want to learn,

01:45:24.564 --> 01:45:28.566
but now that I have learned how
to do it, uh, I like doing it,

01:45:28.568 --> 01:45:31.335
and I like to be in the role
of being able to do some good

01:45:31.337 --> 01:45:32.605
for my community.

01:45:34.807 --> 01:45:37.675
Ryan: To me, it's this
"I can't find peace,"

01:45:37.677 --> 01:45:40.478
and that's the way I can best describe it.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.747
In some moments in prison,

01:45:43.749 --> 01:45:47.751
I had more peace than I do now,
and I can't figure that out.

01:45:47.753 --> 01:45:50.522
I think that's what they
call being institutionalized.

01:45:50.524 --> 01:45:52.523
You know, you're in there
so long, that's your life.

01:45:52.525 --> 01:45:53.825
You don't know anything else.

01:45:53.827 --> 01:45:57.528
I mean, I lived... I lived
my whole adult life in prison.

01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:59.531
I'm about to be 30, and I don't know

01:45:59.533 --> 01:46:01.832
what it's like to be an adult.

01:46:01.834 --> 01:46:04.434
It's just really, though, that I
don't really feel like I fit in.

01:46:04.436 --> 01:46:06.837
I'm just completely lost,

01:46:06.839 --> 01:46:09.439
and that's... that's weird for me

01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:11.442
because I worked really hard

01:46:11.444 --> 01:46:13.710
not to ever feel that,

01:46:13.712 --> 01:46:16.346
to avoid that, and all that hard work

01:46:16.348 --> 01:46:19.250
just feels like it's just... just crap.

01:46:19.252 --> 01:46:20.652
It's not a good feeling.

01:46:20.654 --> 01:46:23.420
You could not have a bigger failure

01:46:23.422 --> 01:46:25.689
in the police investigation

01:46:25.691 --> 01:46:27.959
and the whole judicial system.

01:46:27.961 --> 01:46:31.595
I mean, you've accomplished
nothing, and you've ac...

01:46:31.597 --> 01:46:34.331
you've actually damaged
this innocent person,

01:46:34.333 --> 01:46:36.836
and you've got a killer still out there.
