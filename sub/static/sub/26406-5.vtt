00:04.656 --> 00:04.874
.

00:04.917 --> 00:07.485
- Hey guys, we're heading to
the hospital to have the baby.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.270
- Oh, my God.
Are you in labor?

00:09.313 --> 00:12.447
- No, but the baby's a week
late so we are inducing

00:12.490 --> 00:15.015
and it's no fault of Dina's

00:15.058 --> 00:16.581
that she did not deliver
on schedule.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.670
- Yeah, well, by the way you
only paid me for 40 weeks

00:18.714 --> 00:20.150
so I
will be charging you overtime.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.718
- Well, when I don't get
a package on time

00:22.761 --> 00:26.069
the shipping company gives me
a refund and an apology.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
Anyway, you all have my
cell phone number

00:28.115 --> 00:30.508
but only call
if it is a true emergency

00:30.552 --> 00:33.120
like a fire, or a big storm,
or a robbery, okay?

00:33.163 --> 00:36.340
- What if a celebrity comes
in the store like Alec Baldwin,

00:36.384 --> 00:39.082
or Billy Baldwin,
or Stephen Baldwin?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.475
- It doesn't matter which
Baldwin--

00:40.518 --> 00:42.694
you don't need to call.
Just enjoy.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.348
- Uh, Glenn,
can I give you a call

00:44.392 --> 00:46.089
if I really, really,
miss you?

00:46.133 --> 00:48.352
- Aww, of course you can.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.572
Any other questions?
Yes?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.356
- Do you have any room
in your car?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.358
I think maybe my water
just broke.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.534
all: Oh!
- Oh, my God.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.449
- No, no. You're not due
for another three weeks.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.190
- Oh yeah, that's right.
Never mind.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.236
- Thanks a lot, Amy.
You got it on my shoes.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.499
- Oh, no, those shoes
were so cool.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.196
- 'Kay, come on.
Let's get to the hospital.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.589
- I'm gonna get your stuff.
- Thank you.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.766
Amy had her baby early.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.202
Was that so hard?

01:12.246 --> 01:13.986
- You're such a kiss-ass.
- I didn't choose today.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.340
♪

01:19.383 --> 01:23.431
- Okay, I got your fluffy
socks, your cellphone charger,

01:23.474 --> 01:25.781
also got a copy of "Us Weekly"
in case you wanted to see

01:25.824 --> 01:28.392
a four-page spread of
Gwen Stefani pumping gas.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.960
- Ah, I love it when they pump
their own gas.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.440
- Hey, Amy!

01:32.483 --> 01:34.311
Look quick--I see a
hummingbird out my window.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.705
Do you see it?
- Uh-huh.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.272
- I don't think you're
really looking.

01:38.315 --> 01:41.840
- I am.

01:44.365 --> 01:47.107
- Yeah, okay.
It's nice, right?

01:47.150 --> 01:48.934
- So nice.

01:48.978 --> 01:55.419
- Okay, uh, you seem to be all
set, so I guess I'm gonna go?

01:55.463 --> 01:57.465
- Oh.
- I mean, I don't have to.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.683
- I'm fine staying here--
- No, no, no, no.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.163
- Or if you want me
to stay I can--

02:00.207 --> 02:02.252
- You can go if--
You tell me

02:02.296 --> 02:03.427
what you want me to do.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.603
- Um, well, I mean,

02:05.647 --> 02:07.779
I don't want you to feel
like you have to stay,

02:07.823 --> 02:11.174
but I don't want you to feel
like you can't stay.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.395
- Okay, cool, so then
I'll just...

02:14.438 --> 02:16.571
Sorry, still no idea.

02:16.614 --> 02:20.183
- I think I want you here,
but, like, not here-here.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.619
Just like, around.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.447
You know how like at
The Cheesecake Factory

02:23.491 --> 02:25.275
they give you a buzzer
and you just have to stay

02:25.319 --> 02:26.798
within a certain
radius?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.410
- Buzzer radius, got it. Okay.
So, yeah, I'll just stay

02:29.453 --> 02:32.326
in the general vicinity
at an appropriate distance

02:32.369 --> 02:34.676
for a guy you're dating
who is not the father.

02:34.719 --> 02:38.549
- Oh! The father.
I should tell Adam.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.029
- Yeah.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.469
♪ My eyes become large

02:45.513 --> 02:50.735
♪ And the light that
you shine can be seen ♪

02:50.779 --> 02:53.303
- That makes no sense.
You would get sick.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.696
- I'm not saying you
wouldn't get sick.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.306
I'm just saying that every
arrangement

02:56.350 --> 02:58.395
is technically an
edible arrangement.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.136
- Glenn, today is all
about Dina.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.485
If she wants to eat
the flowers,

03:01.529 --> 03:03.008
let her eat the flowers.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.488
- Knock-knock. Hi.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.316
I'm Dr. Sidian, I'm the
attending on the floor.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.883
- Holy crap.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.624
- I know Dr. Meyer is on her
way, but in case you guys

03:09.667 --> 03:11.234
need anything before she
gets here,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.627
I'm around.
- Yeah.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.195
- Any questions, pain meds,
perfect martini.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.807
Martini.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.201
Shaken, not stirred, Mr. Bond.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.811
That's Dr. Bond.

03:22.854 --> 03:26.031
- Oh, wow, yes!
- I'm around. Give me a call.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.251
- Yeah, he's an attractive man.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.035
- I think we should switch
to Dr. Sidian.

03:30.079 --> 03:33.038
- No, but we've been seeing
Dr. Meyer for nine months.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.692
- Yeah, I just feel more
comfortable with this guy.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.129
Honestly, I was never
a Dr. Meyer fan.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.915
I didn't want to say anything
but during one of our exams

03:39.958 --> 03:42.265
she was accidentally looking
into my butt the whole time.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.962
I think she got confused,

03:44.006 --> 03:45.399
and I felt bad
correcting her.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.009
- Glenn, this is about Dina
and her needs.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.793
If she feels more comfortable
with this doctor,

03:48.837 --> 03:51.579
then that's all
that matters.

03:51.622 --> 03:55.322
- Fine, we'll go with Doctor
Stranger-we-just-met.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.541
- Thank you, Jerusha.
Also, for my comfort,

03:57.585 --> 03:59.195
would you be able to go
to my apartment

03:59.239 --> 04:00.936
and get this camisole?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.546
It's silky, very sheer,

04:02.590 --> 04:03.808
and also my
make

04:03.852 --> 04:06.333
- Sure, whatever you need.
- Thanks.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.073
- Oh, and honey, watch out
for the bird.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.161
She has a falcon now.

04:09.205 --> 04:11.338
- Ah, will do.
- Okay.

04:11.381 --> 04:15.037
- And grab a push-up bra!
- Okay!

04:15.080 --> 04:16.560
We parked this way.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.563
- Oh, my God! All right,
yeah, awesome, great.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.826
I've just gotta drop off my
friend Steve at karate

04:21.870 --> 04:23.828
and I will be right there.
Which hospital?

04:23.872 --> 04:26.962
- Uh, Mercy Vale Medical
Center, room...

04:27.005 --> 04:28.616
- 417.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.139
- 417.

04:36.711 --> 04:40.367
That--that is Jonah.
He's here...

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
and so is Glenn.

04:42.456 --> 04:48.331
And Dina. The whole--the whole
funky bunch is here.

04:48.375 --> 04:52.117
I gotta go, I'll see you soon.
Okay, bye.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.599
- So Adam doesn't know
about us?

04:55.643 --> 04:59.995
- No, because I--I--I didn't
want to tell him.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.302
- Oh.
Okay.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.174
- I mean, not--not--not because
we're doing something wrong.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.350
It's just that, um...

05:07.394 --> 05:09.657
Just didn't seem like that
big of a deal.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.661
- Oh, okay, well that
makes me feel better.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.447
- Okay, I'm having everybody
sign two cards.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.145
One for Amy and the whole
Glenn, Dina, Jerusha mess.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.017
I thought the butterflies was
perfect for Amy because,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.845
you know, she's entering a new
phase in her life

05:23.888 --> 05:27.805
and this one has balloons
because, you know, Glenn.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.982
- Little more information
than I need, but...

05:33.245 --> 05:38.294
- Thank you.
"Happy 0th birthday."

05:38.338 --> 05:40.601
Cute.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.516
- Wait, wait. Hold up.
What's wrong with that?

05:42.559 --> 05:46.215
- Oh, nothing. This is fine.
It's funny.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.651
- I mean, I wasn't, you know--

05:47.695 --> 05:49.174
I was just going off
the top of my head.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.828
I wasn't trying to be, like,
hilarious or anything.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.830
- Okay.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.659
- You know, I'm gonna take
another look at it.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.183
- Up to you. Just pass it
along when you're done.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.098
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.105
Yes.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.629
Nah.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.022
- Hi, can I get the dad's
insurance card?

06:11.066 --> 06:13.590
- Oh, no, he's not the dad.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:13.634 --> 06:17.072
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't
mean, "He's not the dad,"

06:17.115 --> 06:18.378
like I was having an affair

06:18.421 --> 06:19.683
and got knocked up
by some rando.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.251
I just mean that the man
I had sex with,

06:22.294 --> 06:24.340
he is the father of
this baby.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.559
- I understand.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.212
I'm not a nurse
but we take a class.

06:27.256 --> 06:30.825
The reason I'm asking is we
don't accept your insurance.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.176
- Oh, but her coworker's having
a baby in the next room

06:34.219 --> 06:35.699
and you take their insurance.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.223
- Well, looks like they're on
a different plan.

06:38.267 --> 06:44.621
They have health shield bronze
and what you have is different.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.668
- Worse.
It's worse.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.887
- Of course. Corporate takes
care of the managers

06:49.931 --> 06:51.541
and the rest of us
get the scraps.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.413
- Can we please not do
all of that right now?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.892
- So, you could pay out
of pocket,

06:54.936 --> 06:56.851
but the room is about
two grand a night.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.330
- Whoa.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.115
- Or there's a clinic nearby
that accepts your insurance.

07:00.158 --> 07:04.815
- Okay, and the clinic is good,
right?

07:04.859 --> 07:07.862
- It's been there for years.

07:07.905 --> 07:10.865
- That didn't answer
my question.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.128
Oh, God.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.350
- Can I finish complaining

07:18.394 --> 07:19.874
about healthcare
inequality now?

07:19.917 --> 07:20.962
- No.

07:26.054 --> 07:26.228
.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.665
- Can't believe my baby's going
to be born in a hospital

07:28.709 --> 07:30.232
that looks like an escape room.

07:30.275 --> 07:34.497
- I--I like it here.
That other hospital was snobby.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.500
- This is, um-- you know,
this is down to Earth.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.850
It's connected to the
community. It's diverse.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.896
- I don't want diverse
right now.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.506
I want to be in the hospital

07:43.550 --> 07:44.986
where only rich white
people go.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.378
I want to feel deeply
uncomfortable

07:46.422 --> 07:47.902
that I'm the only
brown person there.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.295
- We just have to make
the best of it, okay?

07:50.339 --> 07:53.821
Honestly, you look around,
it's kinda roomy once you--

07:53.864 --> 07:55.518
Oh, my God.

07:55.562 --> 07:59.174
Uh, hi, sorry. I'm Jonah.
This--this is...

07:59.217 --> 08:03.831
- Is she sleeping with her
eyes open or...

08:03.874 --> 08:06.529
- Yes, let's go with that.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.139
- Ah.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.924
- Hey Garrett, do you have
the baby cards?

08:09.967 --> 08:11.403
I need to sign them.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.840
- Yeah, I'm just putting
the finishing touches on it.

08:12.883 --> 08:16.104
- Oh, boy.
Mr. Hilarious at work.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.409
What are you writing?

08:17.453 --> 08:20.674
- Um, well,
you are about to see.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.111
- Ah, I love
the creative process.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.244
I bet it's gonna be so funny.
Here we go.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.207
I can't even imagine all the
ideas in your head right now.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.774
I bet even the bad ones
are genius.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.037
- Yup, uh-huh, but you know,
I just need to concentrate.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.429
- Okay, oh, boy.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.867
You are really cooking up
something good.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.565
I can smell the creative
juices.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.742
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.310
- Your hours must be
pretty crazy, huh?

08:48.353 --> 08:49.572
All those late night pages

08:49.616 --> 08:51.879
putting a real strain on
the marriage.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.489
- I'm not married.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.709
- Oh, wow. Didn't realize we
were getting so personal.

08:55.752 --> 08:59.451
- I'm not married either, so,
something in common.

09:01.453 --> 09:04.326
- Well, I am married,
but I wish I wasn't

09:04.369 --> 09:08.025
'cause then I could hit
on this bodacious babe.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.027
- Glenn, that hurts my
feelings.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.768
- Oh, no, it's for Dina.

09:11.812 --> 09:12.856
She really likes him.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.119
- Oh.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.382
You know, I've never been with
a woman before,

09:17.426 --> 09:20.429
but I would
switch over for Dina.

09:20.472 --> 09:25.869

I'm, uh--I'm very straight.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.436

cervix now.

Pretty funny, right?

09:57.858 --> 09:58.902

10:00.687 --> 10:01.905

- Cute.

And the air smells so good,
and these pillows.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.615
This is an unbelievable pillow.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.747
We should come back here.

the payment goes?

Pay the nice lady.

- Right, okay, so if you could
put $500 on each of these cards

12:01.155 --> 12:03.766
and then I'll write you a check
for the other $1,000.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.247
- Okay, and how would you like
to pay for the rest?

12:08.553 --> 12:11.643
- Yes, for the room, but then
you have delivery doctor,

12:11.687 --> 12:13.167
lab fees, anesthesia.

12:13.210 --> 12:17.040
Altogether you're looking

- Oh, God.

figure out

12:24.352 --> 12:28.486
what you want to do, although,
well you know.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.228
- Guess we're going
back to the clinic.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.629
- You mean the pillow that
I brought from home?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.066
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.460
- Okay, so we need to come up
with one good message

12:45.503 --> 12:46.983
that's from all of us.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.680
- What's wrong with the ones
that we already wrote?

12:48.724 --> 12:52.946
- Uh, well, a lot of them
were offensive.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.730
And I'm not gonna name
any names,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.254
but it was Carol.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.430
I wrote,
"Welcome to the world."

12:59.474 --> 13:01.258
- Mm-hmm, yeah, the world

13:01.302 --> 13:04.522
that's full of violence
and racism

13:04.566 --> 13:06.350
so, welcome to violence
and racism.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.351
Nice, Carol.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.353
- Nice job, Carol.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.529
- You know I can fit 40
cherries in my mouth?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.836
Any more than that
and I throw up.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.404
- Okay, then don't do that.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.495
- So, baby's fine. It's in
a transverse position, though.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.975
It's sideways.
I thought I could turn it

13:22.018 --> 13:23.846
but we're gonna
have to do a C-section.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.326
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.242
- Surgery. Where you,
uh, cut me open, huh?

13:28.285 --> 13:29.634
- Uh, nope. Actually, this way.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.420
- Oh. East/West situation.

13:32.463 --> 13:33.943
- That's correct.
- Okay.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.728
- I had an aunt who tore from
her anus

13:36.772 --> 13:39.122
all the way up
to the front.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.169
So...

13:44.084 --> 13:46.738
Oh, God. I should have
just done this at home.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.784
My Aunt delivered her baby
in her Jacuzzi

13:48.828 --> 13:50.394
and he turned out fine.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.875
No, actually he sucks.
His parents are Jacuzzi people.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.051
- Okay, just--just breathe.
You're doing great.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.357
- Ahhhhhh.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.749
- That's right, just pick
a point in the room

13:57.793 --> 13:59.621
and focus on it, okay?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.623
- Okay.
- No, no, no. Not the corpse.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.798
Not the corpse.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.582
- It's too late,
I'm locked in.

14:10.023 --> 14:13.591
No, no, sorry.
Uh, I'm fine. You're old.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.332
- Are you, uh,
are you going to be

14:15.376 --> 14:18.596
the main doctor delivering
the baby?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.773
- Oh, no.
That would be my father.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.299
Just kidding.
- Ha ha. Funny.

14:25.342 --> 14:28.737
- Are you--are you, uh, looking
for something?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.782
- I don't remember.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.005
- How about,
"Best wishes from Cloud 9"?

14:36.049 --> 14:38.399
- No offense, but I hate that.
- Yeah.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.924
- What about, "Best wishes from
your Cloud 9 family?"

14:41.968 --> 14:44.927
- Um, family feels a little
weird since a lot of us

14:44.971 --> 14:47.147
are banging each
other. Guilty!

14:47.190 --> 14:48.757
- I think we should write
something funny.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.280
I mean, people like funny,
right?

14:50.324 --> 14:52.543
- Yeah, okay Earl.
That sounds easier than it is.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.111
Uh, why don't we not embarrass
ourselves by even trying.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.027
- Yeah, but--

14:58.071 --> 15:00.290
I was thinking it could be
funny, because,

15:00.334 --> 15:02.989
it's like so
twisted .

15:03.032 --> 15:05.121
It makes you laugh, 'cause it's
like, crazy.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.172
Am I right or am I right?
I'm right!

15:12.215 --> 15:13.869
- He's right,
you should do that.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.827
He didn't say anything.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.835
- All right, on the next
contraction

15:23.879 --> 15:25.968
you're gonna push
for three ten-counts.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.665
- No, no, we can't
start pushing.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
The father's not
here yet.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.192
- N-no.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.630
The gay best
friend? I see a lot of that.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.850
- No, no, no, I'm just--
I'm actually, um,

15:38.894 --> 15:40.852
I actually, I don't know
what I am.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.202
We haven't really
talked about it.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.987
I don't know,
we're dating, maybe?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
- Right, yeah. We'll see
an occasional movie

15:46.902 --> 15:49.209
and then sometimes I'm there
when she gives birth to a baby.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.211
- Well, I don't know Jonah.
What would you call it?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.690
- I don't know.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.866
- What would happen if we just
didn't do the surgery?

15:54.910 --> 15:56.564
And the baby will eventually
work its way out

15:56.607 --> 15:57.869
like a splinter, right?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.654
I mean, life always
finds a way.

15:59.697 --> 16:03.005
- Dina, you're gonna be fine.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.876
And we'll be right down
the hall

16:04.920 --> 16:06.487
waiting for you when
you're done.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.360
- No, see, we're not doctors,

16:10.404 --> 16:12.580
so we don't go into
the operating room.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.016
We go to the waiting room.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.411
- Actually, the parents are
usually in there for it.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.847
- Okay, but, well, yeah,

16:18.890 --> 16:20.718
we'll probably just
get in the way, so.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.939
- Glenn, I think we should
both be in there for Dina.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.028
- Okay, I get really squeamish
around blood.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.683
- Maybe she doesn't have
a lot of blood.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.033
- Don't go.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.514
- O-okay.
- Okay.

16:33.557 --> 16:37.344
- Right, you must be Dina Fox.
Hello, I'm Dr. Gillespie.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.650
I'll be administering
the epidural.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.739
- Damn, what is with this
place?

16:41.783 --> 16:43.959
It's like "Grey's Anatomy"
in here.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.917
- Yeah.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.094
- Let's go.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.053
.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.621
- I'd like to get up there
by Dina.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.057
Oh you're coming here?
- Sir, I need to get in there.

16:55.101 --> 16:58.191
- Okay, I'll go this way.
Oh, no. I'm trapped.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.062
- Dina, everything's
going to be okay.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.194
- Uh-huh.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.543
It's a real professional
operation

17:02.586 --> 17:04.110
they've got going on here.

17:04.153 --> 17:08.244
There's computers and wires--
the whole nine yards.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.944
- No problem.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.951
- Yeah, it's my favorite song.

17:19.995 --> 17:24.347
♪

17:24.391 --> 17:27.872
Okay.
I'm ready.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.831
- Obviously it's not just
about the sex.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
- One, two...
- There are feelings there.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.442
- We can talk about this later.
- Three!

17:32.486 --> 17:34.096
- Maybe focus on this.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.967
- I just think that there's
a lot going on between him

17:36.011 --> 17:37.621
and the baby and it just seems
like a lot of pressure.

17:37.665 --> 17:38.883
- It's totally cool, and we
can table this.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.233
- ...ten, and stop.

17:40.276 --> 17:43.192
- Both. Jesus.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.628
- All right, here we go.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.283
- Oh, no. Uh, maybe we could
turn her around.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.634
Turn her around.
Oh, there's the blood.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.375
Okay, we are in it.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.290
- I see the head.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.206
- Oh, thank God.
I have had the craziest day.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.773
- I've had a pretty nutty
day too.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.601
- Thanks for filling in.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.647
Um, guess this is yours.
I'll get that.

18:03.691 --> 18:04.866
- I'll just grab the other leg.

18:04.909 --> 18:05.823
- Okay, thanks.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.522
- Wow, there is so much blood.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.698
Should someone do something
about that?

18:10.741 --> 18:13.744
Okay, I'm just gonna close
my eyes.

18:13.788 --> 18:17.313
Nope. Still kinda seeing it.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.923
I'll pick them up.
I'll pick them up.

18:18.967 --> 18:22.405
- One last push.
- Let's do this! C'mon!

18:22.449 --> 18:24.364
Mm.
- Uh. Yeah.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.018
Huh?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.542
Team!

18:28.585 --> 18:32.415
- Jerusha.
I can see its little arms.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
It's so beautiful.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.679
Nope, these are just
the intestines.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.160
- Oh.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.511
- Uh-huh.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.687

18:46.864 --> 18:48.910
- It's a boy!
Congratulations.

18:48.953 --> 18:52.566
And look at that.
A healthy baby girl.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.308
Congrats, everyone.
- Thank God.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.527
- Who's gonna cut
the umbilical cord?

18:57.571 --> 18:59.790
You should probably do it.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.271
- Yeah, yeah.
I was gonna.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.012
- Dina, you did it.

19:04.055 --> 19:08.059
- Jerusha, I'm so happy.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.278
- Hi.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.585
Hi, little buddy.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.064
Hi.
- Good heavens!

19:13.108 --> 19:15.676
Did you know there's
a dead body in here?

19:15.719 --> 19:19.201
Margaret! We got another
damn body!

19:26.774 --> 19:29.559
- I love you more than pot pies

19:29.603 --> 19:32.171
and Christmas

19:32.214 --> 19:34.651
and even little baby Jesus.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.914
Don't tell anybody.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.396
- Dina, we can't thank you
enough for giving us such

19:40.440 --> 19:41.789
an amazing gift.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
- I didn't get you a gift.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.096
Oh, you mean the baby.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.576
Yeah, you paid me for that,
so we're good.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.926
Yeah. Um...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.667
would it be okay if I had
a moment alone with her?

19:50.711 --> 19:53.104
- Oh, yeah, of course.

19:53.148 --> 19:56.586
- Oh, no thank you.
You can put it in its bin.

19:56.630 --> 19:59.459
- You take all the time
you need.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.853
- She's not gonna kidnap her,
right?

20:02.897 --> 20:06.117
- No, I locked all the windows.

20:06.901 --> 20:10.209
- Well, this is it
for you and me, kid.

20:10.252 --> 20:13.168
I hope I gave you a good start
the past nine months.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.650
Now, if you ever need anything,

20:16.693 --> 20:18.782
you can always come to me.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.262
But not on Wednesdays
or Fridays,

20:20.306 --> 20:22.656
because I have crew practice.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.093
All right, what else
can I tell you?

20:25.136 --> 20:27.269
Never go camping
on your period.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.663
If you ever find a pair
of shoes you like,

20:29.706 --> 20:32.187
buy multiple pairs.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.581
You meet a man with
a houseboat,

20:34.624 --> 20:35.669
walk the other way.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.801
That's an important one.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.977
- Hey, little buddy.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.546
He's not as squishy and purple
as Emma was.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.808
- Mm-mm.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.984
- She was so squishy.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.464
- She's perfect.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.292
You're perfect.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.338
- Oh, wow. Uh,
look at the time.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.687
I--I completely lost track.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.254
I got a meeting--party.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.342
I got a party meeting.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.865
So, let you guys
have some time.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.041
- Thanks.
- Sure.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.478
- Yeah. Thank you.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.524
- You're welcome.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.788
- Hi. Hi.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.617
card.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.316
- He's had a big day.
But congratulations.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.971
- Let's go!
