00:31.000 --> 00:32.417
'Emissaries..'

00:32.500 --> 00:34.583
Commander Sinclair!

00:34.667 --> 00:36.083
It is good to see you again.

00:36.167 --> 00:38.250
And you. It's been a while.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.292
This is my first officer

00:39.375 --> 00:40.917
Lieutenant Commander
Susan Ivanova.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.375
Susan, Dr. Stephen Franklin

00:42.458 --> 00:43.958
'our new
medical chief of staff.'

00:44.042 --> 00:45.667
It's a pleasure,
I followed your work

00:45.750 --> 00:47.042
while I was stationed back home.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.250
We're honored to have you
aboard.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.542
Well, thank you.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.125
Ran into Dr. Kyle
at the transfer point

00:51.208 --> 00:52.958
on Io, he sends his regards.

00:53.042 --> 00:54.958
He's really looking forward
to working with the president.

00:55.042 --> 00:56.375
It's a great opportunity.

00:56.458 --> 00:57.917
Well, with so many aliens
migrating to Earth

00:58.000 --> 01:00.500
we need more people like him
back home.

01:00.583 --> 01:03.250
So when do I start?

01:03.333 --> 01:06.667
- As soon as you'd like.
- Sinclair.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.958
(male #1)
'I'm getting a disturbance
in the jump gate, commander.'

01:09.042 --> 01:10.458
'Thought
you'd wanna check it out.'

01:10.542 --> 01:11.958
Alright. On my way.

01:12.042 --> 01:13.667
If you'll see the good doctor
the rest of the way

01:13.750 --> 01:15.750
I'll catch up with you later.

01:17.208 --> 01:21.458
- Always this busy around here?
- Yes, we like it that way.

(male #2)
'Dr. 416, I'm about to..'

01:27.833 --> 01:29.167
Okay. What have we got?

01:29.250 --> 01:31.417
Unidentified ship
coming through the jump gate.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.708
Frequency, silhouette,
star drive

01:33.792 --> 01:35.375
doesn't match anything
we've seen before.

01:35.458 --> 01:37.708
How long before it comes out
of hyperspace?

01:37.792 --> 01:38.750
Right now.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.875
[dramatic music]

01:54.625 --> 01:58.500
Trajectory's wild.
She's out of control.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.833
It's on a collision course,
heading straight for us!

02:00.917 --> 02:04.000
[music continues]

02:10.125 --> 02:13.583
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

02:13.667 --> 02:16.875
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari War.

02:16.958 --> 02:20.375
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:20.458 --> 02:23.625
Its goal, to prevent
another war by creating a place

02:23.708 --> 02:25.125
where humans and aliens

02:25.208 --> 02:27.500
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:27.583 --> 02:30.375
It's a port of call,
a home away from home

02:30.458 --> 02:35.750
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:35.833 --> 02:40.208
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2500,000 tons

02:40.292 --> 02:42.125
of spinning metal

02:42.208 --> 02:44.375
all alone in the night.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.792
It can be a dangerous place

02:47.875 --> 02:50.917
but it's our last, best hope
for peace.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.875
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:54.958 --> 02:57.250
The year is 2258.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.917
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.958
- 'Response yet?'
- Negative.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.625
I'm gonna try to link up
with the ship.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.417
If I can't make it,
you'll have to blow that ship

03:52.500 --> 03:54.458
before it hits.

03:54.542 --> 03:55.958
Why not destroy it now?

03:56.042 --> 03:57.958
First contact protocol,
lieutenant commander.

03:58.042 --> 04:00.458
...clear and present danger.

04:00.542 --> 04:03.125
If this is a new technology,
a new race

04:03.208 --> 04:04.500
I want that ship intact.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.875
This is not
a clear and present danger?

04:06.958 --> 04:09.208
I must read the rulebook again.
Open defense grid.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.833
[rumbling]

04:10.917 --> 04:13.667
- Defense grid activated.
- Checking incoming ship.

04:13.750 --> 04:14.833
Five by five.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.833
- One minute to impact.
- 'Closing in.'

04:49.917 --> 04:53.958
(Sinclair)
Twenty feet. Ten, five.

04:54.042 --> 04:55.542
Activating grapple.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.208
- 'Negative contact on grapple.'
- Forty seconds!

05:02.292 --> 05:03.833
Activating grapple.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.708
- I'm not getting it.
- Ten seconds.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.292
If I don't get it in the next
pass, you'll have to destroy it.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.125
Understood.
Standby defense grid!

05:16.208 --> 05:18.167
Prepare to fire!
On my mark, by the second.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.292
[music continues]

05:27.833 --> 05:29.542
Got it.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.208
'Heading for flight bay.'

05:31.292 --> 05:34.292
Tell Dr. Franklin
to have the Medbay standing by.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.583
...we may have
his first patient.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.750
[indistinct chatter]

05:44.875 --> 05:47.000
- Commander?
- Ambassador Delenn.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.417
I heard about the rescue.
Is the pilot alive?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.792
Barely. Just got him
into the Isolab in time.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.000
Ship was pretty banged up.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.958
Carbon scoring
all over the place.

05:55.042 --> 05:56.917
You mean
that someone attacked his ship?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.917
One more hit and it would've
cracked like an egg.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.042
Can't tell from the damage

06:00.125 --> 06:02.542
if it was Raiders
or something else.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.500
We were able to analyze
the atmosphere in his ship

06:04.583 --> 06:06.125
for the Isolab, but that's all.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.958
We have no idea who he is
or what he is

06:08.042 --> 06:09.292
or where he came from.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.292
I have seen many kinds of life,
commander.

06:12.375 --> 06:15.167
Perhaps I can help identify him.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.500
We'll take all the help
we can get.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.958
Blood pressure is rising.
Respiration up 12%.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.208
So that's good, right?

06:27.292 --> 06:28.708
For a human, yes.

06:28.792 --> 06:31.125
In this case, it may be good

06:31.208 --> 06:32.542
or he may be hyperventilating

06:32.625 --> 06:35.042
before his heart explodes
all over the Isolab.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.958
Ask a silly question,
get a silly answer.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.958
- How's he doing?
- Doc says it's 50-50.

06:41.042 --> 06:42.750
Either way, I'd stay
on this side of the glass

06:42.833 --> 06:44.583
'if I were you.
Trust me on this.'

06:44.667 --> 06:46.125
Have you finished
going over his ship?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.792
Not yet. Parts of it is sealed.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.000
'I don't wanna laser our way in'

06:49.083 --> 06:51.208
'until we know what's inside.'

06:55.042 --> 06:56.667
Shak Tot!

06:56.750 --> 07:00.000
- Shak Tot!
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:00.083 --> 07:02.542
No! What are you doing?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.375
What's the matter with you?

07:05.875 --> 07:09.542
Kill it.
You have to kill it, commander.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.833
Put it back in the ship,
shoot it into space

07:11.917 --> 07:13.500
fire it into the sun!

07:13.583 --> 07:16.333
But you have to kill it quickly!

07:16.417 --> 07:20.167
You're not making any sense.
Why? Why should we kill him?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.167
You don't know?

07:22.250 --> 07:24.750
You don't know
what that thing is?

07:26.042 --> 07:28.917
It is Shak Tot.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.958
It is a Soul Hunter.

07:32.042 --> 07:36.667
Get it off this station now

07:36.750 --> 07:39.042
before it's too late.

07:40.542 --> 07:43.792
Before...someone dies.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.583
[dramatic music]

07:52.000 --> 07:55.583
I apologize for my behavior,
commander.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.042
It's just..

08:00.792 --> 08:03.500
...you do not know these things
as I do.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.292
Then educate me.

08:06.875 --> 08:10.083
Delenn, I've known you
almost two years

08:10.167 --> 08:14.125
and I've never seen you
react so violently before.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.042
Training.

08:16.125 --> 08:20.583
Even as children, every Minbari
is taught to be careful

08:20.667 --> 08:23.167
or the Soul Hunter
will come in the night

08:23.250 --> 08:26.042
and steal their souls.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.042
They are immortal.

08:28.125 --> 08:31.500
No one knows who they are
or where they came from

08:31.583 --> 08:33.875
but they can sense death,
commander.

08:33.958 --> 08:37.917
They are drawn to death
like insects drawn to the light.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.292
Why? What do they get out of it?

08:40.375 --> 08:43.542
An object for their collection.

08:43.625 --> 08:46.083
They have the power
to steal your soul

08:46.167 --> 08:48.417
at the very instant of death.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.000
They are thieves, commander.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.958
They steal
your innermost thoughts

08:52.042 --> 08:54.750
rip away from you
that which is eternal.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.750
'Not every soul.'

08:56.833 --> 09:01.500
Only those they consider
to be of sufficient value.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.917
They have always taken
particular interest

09:04.000 --> 09:07.542
in certain classes of Minbari.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.125
You must believe me, commander.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.458
As long
as the Soul Hunter remains here

09:12.542 --> 09:15.875
everyone in this station
is in terrible danger.

09:15.958 --> 09:17.542
Send it away..

09:18.875 --> 09:20.833
...while you still can.

'Watch it, people.'

09:35.458 --> 09:39.375

Hey, Hoster, how are you?
Okay, step right up.

Here we go, here we go. Place
your bets. Place your bets.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.375
One red ball, three cups.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.333
All you gotta do
is find the little red ball.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.625
Notice it's not here.
It's not here.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.042
Round and round she goes.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.333
Where she stops, nobody knows.
Alright, son. Go ahead.

09:51.417 --> 09:52.833
Pick a winner! Be a winner!
Be a winner! Win!

09:52.917 --> 09:54.500
Double your money!
Double your money!

Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.042

'Okay. Place your bets.
Place your bets. Here we go.'

10:19.000 --> 10:20.833
The place
is practically deserted.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.250
It's as if they're hiding.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.917
The place is shut down tighter
than a drum. I'll link in later.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.042
Interesting,
we've had nearly a dozen ships

10:31.125 --> 10:33.333
ask to leave the station
immediately.

10:33.417 --> 10:36.167
And some of them
weren't due to leave for weeks.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.375
The one thing they have
in common is they're all aliens.

10:38.458 --> 10:42.042
I think word's gotten out about
our friend down in the Isolab.

10:42.125 --> 10:45.542

'Alright, here we go. Now,
remember, ball's right here..'

Place your bet. Place your bet.
Place your bet. Place your bets.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.000
You notice it's not here.
It's not here, okay?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.667
Get your money down. Money down.
Here we go.

10:52.750 --> 10:57.208
Round and round she goes.
Where she stops, no one knows.

Oh, I'm sorry, son.
You're a loser..

11:06.500 --> 11:09.333
It's not here either!
Hey, hey, stop him!

- 'En route to Medlab.'

13:21.208 --> 13:23.375
But I need 20 CCs
of myceotoxin now!

13:23.458 --> 13:26.542
Critical heart wound, upper vena
cava punctured, serrated artery.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.208
Laser cauterization
on the table.

13:28.292 --> 13:31.083
Dull. Muffled.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.917
Slower now.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.333
[beeping]

13:34.417 --> 13:35.708
I'm losing him.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.625
(Soul Hunter)
'Closer.'

13:37.708 --> 13:39.208
Over your shoulder.

13:39.292 --> 13:42.458
It comes, the transition.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.833
A shadow.

13:45.917 --> 13:49.208
The long exhalation
of the spirit.

13:49.292 --> 13:53.042
Can you see it, healer?
Can you see it?

13:53.125 --> 13:54.875
Someone kill that speaker.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.667
[beeping]

13:56.750 --> 14:00.208
Activating full-torso
stimulation. Ready? Now.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.625
[beeping]

14:02.708 --> 14:03.833
Again.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.875
(female #1)
'Flat line.'

14:09.500 --> 14:10.750
Gone.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.250
Turn that speaker on.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.125
Gone now.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.583
'Gone.'

14:22.458 --> 14:23.875
'Gone.'

14:25.042 --> 14:27.292
'Gone.'

14:29.167 --> 14:32.292
If you could only see..

14:35.000 --> 14:39.083
If you could only see..

14:45.375 --> 14:48.000
[speaking in foreign language]

14:50.042 --> 14:53.333
(Sinclair)
'I'm going to ask you again
to identify yourself.'

14:53.417 --> 14:54.458
Who are you?

14:54.542 --> 14:56.292
[speaking in foreign language]

14:56.375 --> 14:59.750
Where are you from?
What happened to your ship?

15:04.167 --> 15:05.917
We checked the Medlab records.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.250
The stabbing took place
at 11:02:13.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.250
Your reactions
at exactly that moment

15:10.333 --> 15:13.083
show you knew he was dying. How?

15:13.167 --> 15:16.250
[speaking in foreign language]

15:18.083 --> 15:21.458
Did you come here for his soul?

15:21.542 --> 15:23.708
'Well, we've heard, if that's
what you're wondering.'

15:23.792 --> 15:26.125
I've never met
a Soul Hunter before.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.958
Don't know if I should believe
any of this or not.

15:29.042 --> 15:32.125
[speaking in foreign language]

15:33.667 --> 15:36.000
Well, I don't think
he's going to cooperate.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.417
I don't blame him.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.750
Who wants to admit
to being a thief

15:41.833 --> 15:43.875
a stealer of souls?

15:43.958 --> 15:46.500
We are not thieves!

15:46.583 --> 15:49.250
We are preservers!

15:49.333 --> 15:50.917
Thought that might
get your attention.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.250
We act
only for the greater good!

15:54.333 --> 15:55.833
The Minbari
don't seem to think so.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.833
Minbari, pale, bloodless.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.708
'Look in their eyes,
you see nothing but mirrors.'

16:01.792 --> 16:04.917
Infinities of reflection.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.875
Will not let us help them, no.

16:08.958 --> 16:12.750
What exactly is a Soul Hunter?

16:12.833 --> 16:17.333
Ask Commander Minbari friend.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.042
We are drawn to the moment

16:22.125 --> 16:23.542
'the moment of surrender'

16:23.625 --> 16:28.125
the instant of loss
between despair and ecstasy.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.917
When the flesh fails
on all that remains behind

16:32.000 --> 16:35.875
the soul, we save.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.542
'Not all.'

16:38.375 --> 16:42.083
Only the special ones.

16:42.167 --> 16:46.083
Leaders, thinkers, poets

16:46.167 --> 16:49.125
dreamers, blessed lunatics.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.417
And what do you do
with these souls

16:52.500 --> 16:54.250
after you've saved them?

16:54.333 --> 16:57.708
We enshrine them.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.208
Worship them.

17:00.292 --> 17:03.458
We talk to them, listen.

17:03.542 --> 17:06.417
We learn.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.458
[chuckles]

17:08.542 --> 17:10.292
Well, this is nonsense.

17:10.375 --> 17:13.208
It's patent superstition.
It can't be done.

17:13.292 --> 17:14.708
With, with the right technology

17:14.792 --> 17:16.583
'maybe you could encode
the personality matrix'

17:16.667 --> 17:18.375
'and produce a clone
of someone's mind.'

17:18.458 --> 17:21.625
But the idea
of taking someone's soul?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.542
Ridiculous, yes.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.000
So let me go.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.417
Not yet.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.083
What is it
between you and the Minbari?

17:30.167 --> 17:31.792
Minbari..

17:32.625 --> 17:34.125
Jealous.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.208
Selfish. Private.

17:37.292 --> 17:40.167
We have saved only a few.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.625
Very rare.

17:41.708 --> 17:45.333
Rarest of all, their leader,
Dukhat, dying.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.458
Your fault. Your war.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.458
'The pinnacle
of Minbari evolution.'

17:50.542 --> 17:52.625
We came, I, others.

17:52.708 --> 17:57.250
They made a wall of bodies
to stop us.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.625
He died..

18:00.708 --> 18:02.958
'...and his dreams..'

18:03.667 --> 18:05.625
'...his ideas.'

18:06.500 --> 18:09.125
All that he was

18:09.208 --> 18:12.917
all that he could ever be

18:13.000 --> 18:16.583
gone, wasted.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.708
Jealous.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.083
Gone.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.125
Gone.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.875
Can he leave here
without a breather unit?

18:28.958 --> 18:31.292
(Franklin)
'Well, it's hard to say.
This is his natural atmosphere.'

18:31.375 --> 18:35.333
But his lungs seem capable
of processing oxygen as well.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.500
Then you'll need a guard.

18:37.583 --> 18:41.667
I'll have somebody from Security
here within the hour.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.667
Personally

18:43.750 --> 18:47.083
I don't believe
you can do what you say.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.167
But your presence here
is disrupting this station

18:50.250 --> 18:52.417
and causing tension
among the alien population.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.042
They consider you to be
a clear and present danger.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.042
And I have no reason
to question their judgment.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.708
You can stay in the Isolab
until your ship is repaired

19:01.792 --> 19:03.417
and you're fit to travel.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.833
As soon as that happens,
I want you off this station.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.042
Any questions?

19:09.125 --> 19:12.250
[speaking in foreign language]

19:13.458 --> 19:15.250
He's all yours, doctor.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.375
[indistinct chatter]

19:22.458 --> 19:24.708
I finished the autopsy
of the stabbing victim.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.250
We're clear
to handle the burial.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.542
Have the next of kin signed off

19:27.625 --> 19:28.792
on the death certificate?

19:28.875 --> 19:29.875
Yes, they can't afford

19:29.958 --> 19:31.875
to send the body home. Here.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.917
Shuttle 5,
you're clear to proceed.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.583
(male #6)
'Confirmed, Babylon Control.'

19:39.667 --> 19:42.708
[instrumental music]

19:43.333 --> 19:45.875
[beeping]

19:47.167 --> 19:50.708
From the stars we came
and to the stars we return

19:50.792 --> 19:53.417
from now until the end of time.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.708
We hereby commit this body
to the deep.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.417
[whooshing]

20:11.208 --> 20:12.792
Something, doctor?

20:12.875 --> 20:16.042
It's all so brief, isn't it?

20:16.125 --> 20:17.667
Typical human lifespan

20:17.750 --> 20:21.125
is almost 100 years.

20:21.208 --> 20:24.750
It's barely a second
compared to what's out there.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.667
Wouldn't be so bad
if life didn't take

20:26.750 --> 20:28.958
so long to figure out.

20:29.042 --> 20:30.792
Seems you just start
to get it right

20:30.875 --> 20:34.417
and then...it's over.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.333
(Susan)
'It doesn't matter.'

20:36.417 --> 20:40.000
If we lived 200 years,
we'd still be human.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.792
We'd still make
the same mistakes.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.667
You're a pessimist.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.708
I am Russian, doctor.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.917
We understand these things.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.292
[dramatic music]

21:07.167 --> 21:09.833
What do you want, Minbari?

21:11.750 --> 21:15.500
Soul Hunters never travel
without their collection.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.292
Where is yours?

21:18.375 --> 21:22.833
Safe. My children are safe.

21:23.958 --> 21:28.042
We talk together of many things.

21:28.125 --> 21:31.083
'They are many and wise'

21:31.167 --> 21:33.917
'and rare.'

21:34.000 --> 21:37.083
'The finest souls.'

21:37.167 --> 21:39.333
Are any of them Minbari?

21:41.542 --> 21:43.667
Understand this.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.750
Before you leave,
I will search your ship

21:46.833 --> 21:49.875
rip every panel,
tear up every floor!

21:49.958 --> 21:51.792
I will gut it from end to end

21:51.875 --> 21:54.500
until I find the souls
you have stolen from us!

21:54.583 --> 21:57.250
And what will you do then?

21:57.333 --> 21:58.958
Free them.

21:59.042 --> 22:01.833
- Release them.
- You mean kill them.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.875
They will join with the souls
of all our people

22:04.958 --> 22:06.500
melt one into another

22:06.583 --> 22:10.917
until they're born into
the next generation of Minbari.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.875
Remove those souls,
and the whole suffers.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.042
We are diminished.

22:17.125 --> 22:20.208
Each generation becomes less
than the one before.

22:20.292 --> 22:22.458
(Soul Hunter)
'A quaint lie.'

22:22.542 --> 22:25.125
Pretty fantasy.

22:26.167 --> 22:29.833
The soul ends with death

22:29.917 --> 22:34.167
unless we act to preserve it.

22:37.458 --> 22:40.167
We will help you..

22:41.667 --> 22:44.375
...in spite of yourselves!

22:46.333 --> 22:47.625
I know you.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.833
You were there at the death
of your leader, Dukhat.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.208
We stopped you from taking

22:54.292 --> 22:56.167
what which you have
no right to take!

22:56.250 --> 22:59.958
You stopped me from saving him.

23:00.042 --> 23:03.292
That is where
it began to go wrong.

23:04.292 --> 23:06.792
The lost souls

23:06.875 --> 23:11.458
one after another after another.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.833
'Voices stilled.'

23:14.542 --> 23:16.583
'I failed'

23:16.667 --> 23:18.958
'because you stopped me.'

23:19.958 --> 23:21.333
Failed.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.583
The pattern began.

23:26.292 --> 23:28.792
I remember.

23:28.875 --> 23:33.667
They called you Satai Delenn
of the Grey Council.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.083
'Curious.'

23:36.792 --> 23:38.625
Curious.

23:38.708 --> 23:42.000
What is one of the great leaders
of the Minbari

23:42.083 --> 23:44.708
doing here playing ambassador?

23:44.792 --> 23:47.875
[instrumental music]

23:51.958 --> 23:53.875
[glass shattering]

24:01.667 --> 24:03.667
Med alert! Isolab One!

24:03.750 --> 24:05.208
Med alert!

24:06.125 --> 24:07.708
[buzzing]

24:07.792 --> 24:10.833
[dramatic music]

24:35.417 --> 24:38.250
[instrumental music]

24:46.125 --> 24:49.458
Be at peace, my children.

24:53.333 --> 24:57.083
I now know what has brought us
to this place.

24:58.417 --> 25:01.042
At last I know

25:01.125 --> 25:03.250
who we have come for.

25:07.167 --> 25:08.292
How's the guard doing?

25:08.375 --> 25:09.958
Doctor says he suffered
a mild concussion

25:10.042 --> 25:11.000
but he'll be alright.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.917
Any idea
where the hunter is now?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.250
My boys are looking everywhere.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.083
We know he got to his ship
before we did.

25:16.167 --> 25:17.667
We checked it out
and found a cabinet

25:17.750 --> 25:19.958
that wasn't there the first time
we went over the place.

25:20.042 --> 25:21.125
Did a good job of hiding it.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.083
- Anything inside?
- Negative.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.375
Whatever was there,
he's got it now.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.333
My guess is he'll head
toward the Alien Sector

25:27.417 --> 25:29.083
assuming
he hasn't already done so.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.167
'He'd draw
too much attention elsewhere.'

25:31.250 --> 25:34.667
Agreed. Only thing I can't
figure out is why.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.042
Even if his ship
were operational

25:37.125 --> 25:38.458
he can't leave anyway.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.583
'We've got security all over
the docking bays.'

25:40.667 --> 25:43.292
He's alone. What's he after?

25:43.375 --> 25:46.458
Delenn says these hunters
are drawn to death.

25:46.542 --> 25:48.333
'The more important
the person about to die'

25:48.417 --> 25:50.167
'the more they're drawn to it.'

25:50.250 --> 25:52.750
If that's the reason,
all we have to do

25:52.833 --> 25:55.000
is figure out
who's about to die.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.792
[dramatic music]

26:00.875 --> 26:02.083
Part!

26:09.917 --> 26:11.958
- You are N'grath?
- Yes.

26:12.042 --> 26:14.333
I sell

26:14.417 --> 26:17.458
provide, fix.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.750
Do you know what I am?

26:19.833 --> 26:22.958
Yes. You wish to buy?

26:24.542 --> 26:26.125
Yes.

26:26.208 --> 26:30.750
I require a guide to this place.

26:30.833 --> 26:33.625
All the secret ways

26:33.708 --> 26:36.167
corners, tubes

26:36.250 --> 26:39.583
places to hide, places to run

26:39.667 --> 26:43.042
ways in and ways out.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.833
Difficult.

26:45.917 --> 26:49.500
Requires level-five security.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.333
Earthers only.

26:51.417 --> 26:55.292
Very expensive. You can afford?

26:55.792 --> 26:57.167
I must.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.750
I have a mission.

27:00.833 --> 27:04.583
A soul will be lost
if I do not act.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.417
This I cannot allow.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.917
(Susan)
'Confirmed Epsilon 3,
you're cleared for jump.'

27:14.000 --> 27:15.583
You may proceed to gate.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.208
How many ships
are still in holding?

27:17.292 --> 27:19.417
Three more. Um, standby.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.250
There's a ship
coming through the gate.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.542
Confirmed.
Entry in five seconds.

27:23.625 --> 27:27.125
- Nothing's scheduled.
- Don't tell me, tell that.

27:27.208 --> 27:30.250
[rumbling]

27:32.625 --> 27:35.708
[instrumental music]

27:42.625 --> 27:43.875
Two Soul Hunters.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.208
Did somebody book a convention

27:45.292 --> 27:46.625
without telling me?

27:46.708 --> 27:48.708
Alright, patch me through.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.417
(Sinclair)
'This is Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair of Babylon 5.'

27:51.500 --> 27:53.083
'Please identify yourself.'

27:53.167 --> 27:55.583
You know who and what I am.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.250
I must dock at once.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.292
Someone is about to die.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.458
And if we refuse access?

28:02.542 --> 28:05.500
Then there will be
more than one.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.458
We'll clear you for docking,
we'll link instructions

28:07.542 --> 28:08.792
directly to your nav system.

28:08.875 --> 28:11.750
'If I may ask,
who are you here to see?'

28:11.833 --> 28:13.625
I am here to see you, commander

28:13.708 --> 28:16.875
and quickly,
before it's too late.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.792
[intense music]

28:24.792 --> 28:27.833
[dramatic music]

28:36.208 --> 28:38.625
...going to be like. I don't
think you should meet this guy.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.625
I don't like the look of this,
I don't like the sound of this

28:40.708 --> 28:42.292
hell, I don't like
anything about it.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.167
Ask me, that comment
sounded like a threat.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.958
I'm not so sure. There was
something in his voice.

28:47.042 --> 28:48.458
Not aggressive. Nervous.

28:48.542 --> 28:51.458
Fine. Let him be nervous.
Look, you wait here.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.458
- Let my people deal with him.
- Sorry.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.167
I really hate it
when you get heroic.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.875
Cuts into my business. Man's
gotta earn a living, you know?

28:59.458 --> 29:00.833
[buzzing]

29:00.917 --> 29:04.000
[instrumental music]

29:11.375 --> 29:12.958
You are the commander?

29:15.250 --> 29:16.042
Yes.

29:16.125 --> 29:18.208
I have come for you to warn you.

29:18.292 --> 29:20.292
One of my brothers is here, yes?

29:20.375 --> 29:22.667
That's right. Why?

29:22.750 --> 29:25.500
- You said you had to warn me.
- About him.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.833
I fear he is disturbed.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.792
Deeply, deeply disturbed.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.125
Every moment he remains here

29:31.208 --> 29:33.792
places this station
in terrible danger.

29:33.875 --> 29:36.250
Someone is about to die,
commander

29:36.333 --> 29:38.667
and it will be at his hands.

29:40.708 --> 29:43.292
In the hope that we can
open trade relations

29:43.375 --> 29:44.375
with their people..

29:44.458 --> 29:45.417
[beeps]

29:45.500 --> 29:46.417
Come.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.208
[door whirring]

29:49.292 --> 29:52.583
I have come for you,
Satai Delenn

29:52.667 --> 29:54.958
to save your soul..

29:58.000 --> 29:59.917
...at any cost.

30:02.250 --> 30:06.208
He was ordered to preserve
the soul of the Minbari leader.

30:06.292 --> 30:10.417
Each time he was prevented
or arrived at the death too late

30:10.500 --> 30:14.083
souls were lost,
our order was disgraced.

30:14.917 --> 30:16.875
He was always fragile.

30:16.958 --> 30:20.750
Then he became obsessed
with the fear of losing souls.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.958
One day he said he found
a solution to the problem

30:23.042 --> 30:24.417
and vanished.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.042
And this solution?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.583
To stop waiting for death.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.208
The fear,
the danger of arriving too late

30:31.292 --> 30:33.042
became too great for him.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.042
Now when he finds someone
worthy of preservation

30:35.125 --> 30:37.708
he does not wait, does not risk.

30:37.792 --> 30:40.250
He kills them
to capture their souls.

30:42.792 --> 30:45.083
Our order does not support this.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.750
We've tracked him to a dozen
worlds arriving too late

30:47.833 --> 30:50.083
and others have paid the price.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.750
We almost captured him
two days ago

30:51.833 --> 30:54.208
but he escaped,
his ship damaged..

30:54.292 --> 30:55.708
[device beeping]

30:55.792 --> 30:58.500
- Garibaldi. Go!
- 'Jackson in Green 2, chief.'

30:58.583 --> 31:01.042
(Jackson)
'Just came on duty and found
Henson. He's been stunned!'

31:01.125 --> 31:03.750
Green 2,
that's the ambassadorial wing.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.083
Delenn.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.583
(Soul Hunter)
'You and the others'

31:11.667 --> 31:13.625
'you stopped me.'

31:13.708 --> 31:17.250
Shamed me before my brothers.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.125
I failed
to preserve your leader.

31:21.375 --> 31:25.458
His wisdom, knowledge

31:25.542 --> 31:26.958
gone forever.

31:28.125 --> 31:29.667
Wasted.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.333
I failed.

31:33.833 --> 31:36.208
There must be balance.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.667
Your soul

31:39.750 --> 31:42.667
'one of the Grey Council itself'

31:42.750 --> 31:45.333
'will atone for my failure.'

31:53.542 --> 31:55.833
I give you a great gift.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.667
To live forever..

31:59.333 --> 32:00.792
...in here.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.375
I will be careful.

32:04.458 --> 32:09.083
'You'll hardly feel it
when your body dies.'

32:14.000 --> 32:16.542
[intense music]

32:17.250 --> 32:20.292
[crackling]

32:30.208 --> 32:32.333
(Delenn)
'No! No!'

32:32.417 --> 32:34.042
[dramatic music]

32:34.125 --> 32:35.833
'Let me go!'

32:39.417 --> 32:41.542
Let me go!

32:42.708 --> 32:44.250
Shh.

32:44.333 --> 32:47.583
Do not discomfort your soul!

32:47.667 --> 32:49.708
I could just take it.

32:49.792 --> 32:53.083
I could rip your soul
from your body!

32:54.458 --> 32:56.958
But this damages the soul.

32:58.292 --> 33:01.000
A peaceful death.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.625
A clean transfer.

33:03.708 --> 33:04.833
[Delenn groaning]

33:04.917 --> 33:07.875
I do not wish you
any discomfort.

33:09.792 --> 33:13.708
See, it goes through here

33:13.792 --> 33:15.167
the artery.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.208
And your heart beats

33:20.292 --> 33:23.708
low, quick

33:23.792 --> 33:25.792
muffled.

33:25.875 --> 33:29.875
The blood pounding out

33:29.958 --> 33:31.917
through here.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.958
'And then it slows..'

33:35.042 --> 33:37.625
'...and slows..'

33:37.708 --> 33:39.083
'...and stops.'

33:40.542 --> 33:44.083
You will feel
as if you are falling.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.125
Do not be afraid.

33:47.375 --> 33:51.042
I will be here to catch you.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.667
She's gone, alright.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.750
As I told you, it's too late.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.167
But he cannot escape this time.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.792
We'll bring him back
after the death.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.458
There's not going to be a death.
Not if I can help it.

34:07.542 --> 34:10.458
I'm sorry. It's inevitable.
A Soul Hunter is never wrong.

34:10.542 --> 34:13.167
Here.
You say you can sense death.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.042
You're drawn toward death.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.250
Here. Show me!

34:20.042 --> 34:21.417
The moment comes.

34:21.500 --> 34:25.333
It moves, calls, sings low.

34:25.417 --> 34:26.625
Quickly, here! Here!

34:26.708 --> 34:29.750
[dramatic music]

34:32.542 --> 34:34.458
(Soul Hunter)
'Closer now.'

34:34.542 --> 34:37.583
'It comes, the transition.'

34:39.292 --> 34:41.792
[music continues]

34:41.875 --> 34:43.292
- Anything?
- Alright.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.625
Search by quarters.
Take the section below.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.792
Garibaldi, you take this level.
I'll go topside.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.667
Lock and load.

34:50.750 --> 34:53.000
[dripping]

34:53.083 --> 34:56.125
[instrumental music]

35:07.208 --> 35:09.333
Close now.

35:09.417 --> 35:12.417
Enough for a glimpse
into your soul.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.958
You have planned such a thing?

35:18.375 --> 35:20.875
You would do such a thing?

35:22.417 --> 35:23.917
Incredible.

35:24.792 --> 35:27.833
[intense music]

35:35.792 --> 35:37.167
(Sinclair)
'Delenn?'

35:38.958 --> 35:42.667
No. Not again!

35:43.625 --> 35:45.625
Not again!

35:55.500 --> 35:58.542
[zapping]

36:04.917 --> 36:07.167
Leave us alone!

36:10.708 --> 36:12.208
[groans]

36:18.167 --> 36:21.167
[dramatic music]

36:38.250 --> 36:41.000
Why do you fight for her?

36:41.083 --> 36:44.125
Don't you understand?
She is Satai!

36:44.208 --> 36:46.708
She is Satai!

36:46.792 --> 36:49.042
I have seen her soul!

36:49.125 --> 36:51.292
They're using you.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.708
They're using you!

37:08.958 --> 37:11.708
What are you doing? You...

37:13.042 --> 37:16.042
You don't know
what you're doing.

37:16.125 --> 37:17.667
My children!

37:19.833 --> 37:23.708
My children. Listen. Listen.

37:26.375 --> 37:31.083
I, I never meant any harm.

37:31.167 --> 37:34.125
Listen, listen to me!

37:34.208 --> 37:36.208
You listen to me!

37:37.375 --> 37:38.417
'Children!'

37:38.500 --> 37:41.542
[crackling]

37:59.792 --> 38:02.833
[dramatic music]

38:05.583 --> 38:08.625
[crackling]

38:12.042 --> 38:13.333
[thuds]

38:22.458 --> 38:23.542
Delenn?

38:24.958 --> 38:26.417
'Delenn.'

38:33.292 --> 38:35.333
[instrumental music]

38:37.417 --> 38:39.625
- 'Commander.'
- How's she doing?

38:39.708 --> 38:43.083
Better.
She has a strong constitution.

38:43.167 --> 38:45.375
Amazingly strong, really.

38:45.458 --> 38:48.250
I mean, losing that much blood
would have killed a human.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.042
Explains why they fought so well
during the war.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.208
They just kept going no matter

38:51.292 --> 38:53.458
how great the injury
or loss of blood.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.625
So I hear you saw something.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.208
Yes.

39:05.667 --> 39:06.542
Something.

39:06.625 --> 39:07.750
Uh, well, uh, do you think

39:07.833 --> 39:10.083
you can be
a little more specific?

39:10.167 --> 39:12.792
I'm not sure.

39:12.875 --> 39:16.458
I don't know
if I'll ever be sure.

39:16.542 --> 39:19.542
Well, I,
I still don't believe it.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.250
And I'd be careful
if I were you, commander.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.958
That sort of talk
will get you sent off

39:23.042 --> 39:25.417
on a very long vacation.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.917
[beeping]

39:36.917 --> 39:40.833
I knew you would come.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.458
You should rest.

39:43.542 --> 39:48.167
We were right...about you.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.875
Who was right?

39:49.958 --> 39:51.708
They..

39:51.792 --> 39:54.125
[breathing heavily]

39:55.208 --> 39:57.292
- Delenn?
- No..

39:57.375 --> 40:00.458
No, no, it's okay.
She's just sleeping.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.000
Whatever she had to say,
we'll wait

40:02.083 --> 40:03.833
until she's back on her feet.

40:03.917 --> 40:07.750
Yeah, I'll bet you
half a year's salary

40:07.833 --> 40:10.625
she doesn't finish
that sentence.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.750
[instrumental music]

40:22.542 --> 40:23.458
Computer.

40:23.542 --> 40:25.500
[computer chiming]

40:25.583 --> 40:29.458
Keyword search,
Minbari language.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.250
Designated keyword..

40:33.583 --> 40:34.875
What was it?

40:39.542 --> 40:41.458
Satai.

40:41.542 --> 40:45.500
(computer)
'One reference.
Satai, honorific.'

40:45.583 --> 40:50.542
'Title applied to ruling body
known as Grey Council.'

40:52.458 --> 40:54.125
Why would a member
of the ruling body

40:54.208 --> 40:56.125
be assigned
ambassadorial duties?

40:56.208 --> 40:58.458
That's like assigning
the vice president.

40:58.542 --> 41:03.083
(computer)
'Unknown. Do you wish
to make a further inquiry?'

41:04.500 --> 41:06.833
No, not now.

41:08.625 --> 41:10.000
It can wait.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.292
There's always time.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.042
[instrumental music]

41:30.333 --> 41:33.250
Delenn lost a lot of blood.

41:33.333 --> 41:36.583
But Dr. Franklin thinks he's got
the situation under control.

41:36.667 --> 41:40.792
Yes. If it were to go
differently, I would feel it.

41:40.875 --> 41:44.500
I have a message
for you and your brothers.

41:44.583 --> 41:47.583
Babylon 5 is off-limits
to Soul Hunters.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.000
I know you're doing
what you think is best

41:49.083 --> 41:51.417
but I can't allow it,
not on my station.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.708
I understand.

41:52.792 --> 41:56.583
We are rarely welcomed.
It is our lot.
