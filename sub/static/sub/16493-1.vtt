I've got a bit of a reputation.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.625
So, what are you? A tough guy?

00:22.709 --> 00:25.083
Oh, I don't think anyone's
ever called me tough.

So what exactly is this reputation?

word, but you know what they say,

damage your vital organs

Hi, Milo. Hi, Melissa.

00:43.333 --> 00:46.625
I'm just gonna stand back here.
Good call.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.500
So, Milo, how was your weekend?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.500
-Eventful.
-Yeah, I'll bet.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.000
-I got a new scar. Wanna see?
-Sure.

All right, seriously, dude,
what's going on here? What do you mean?

01:03.500 --> 01:07.667
I mean, what is all of this?
And what is the "J" word?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.959

I don't like to say it out loud.

Ah, it's one of those
heavy-duty bungees they use

01:16.333 --> 01:19.625
to tie stuff down in construction sites.

01:19.709 --> 01:21.083

don't see them again today.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.250
I'll take that action.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.959
-Really?
-Yeah, are you kidding? Milo's tough.

01:36.041 --> 01:38.458
As a matter of fact,
I'll see your pudding pack

01:38.542 --> 01:39.875
and raise you a snickerdoodle.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.709
Or are you just all talk?

01:44.917 --> 01:47.500

why aren't you screaming?

01:47.583 --> 01:50.458
I find it doesn't help.
Just hurts the larynx.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.875
Hand me that bungee and you
better hang on to my backpack.

01:52.959 --> 01:54.417
Wait. [screams]

01:56.959 --> 01:58.834

I'm gonna miss my first

03:38.458 --> 03:40.375
My parents are gonna flip out.

"What doesn't kill you only
makes you late for school."

03:49.208 --> 03:51.875
No, Diogee, run home. I'm going to school.

Plus, if we catch the bus at the next
stop, we may not even be late.

I've got the bus route
marked on my GP... S.

when we fell in the mud.

We'll beat them to the next stop.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.959
We just have to go
through the rock quarry.

Rock quarry, sure.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.875
What could possibly go wrong?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.375
Sorry, boys. There's been a
little oil spill, as you can see.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.458
It's been quite a mess,
so nobody's getting through today.

middle of Coyote Woods.

that are dangerous to pet.

Oh, don't worry. There's no coyotes here.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.125
-There aren't?
-No.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.542
Actually, the woods were named
after actor Peter Coyote.

-Really?
-Yeah.
