WEBVTT

01:45.948 --> 01:48.081
Excuse me, miss?

01:48.083 --> 01:49.816
You dropped this cash.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.818
Oh, no, I didn't.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.787
Well, you did.
I saw you drop it.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.524
No, it's not mine.

01:57.526 --> 02:00.093
You can have it.
It's not mine either.

02:00.095 --> 02:02.963
Can you just
please leave me alone?

02:02.965 --> 02:04.831
Hey. Hey.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.433
Hey.

02:06.435 --> 02:07.768
Hey, hey.
No, no, no. It's okay.

02:07.770 --> 02:09.069
It's okay. No, no, no. Listen!

02:09.071 --> 02:10.804
- Let go of me!
- Listen, it's okay.

02:10.806 --> 02:13.407
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Shh...

02:18.947 --> 02:21.081
You should go.

02:25.154 --> 02:27.587
Help me!

02:42.771 --> 02:45.472
Aww, damn it.

03:07.863 --> 03:09.896
Come on, you old bitch.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.133
Ahh.

03:25.948 --> 03:30.150
12 missing people
in the last two months.

03:30.152 --> 03:33.587
Now, half a dozen
dismembered bodies,

03:33.589 --> 03:37.824
their fingers
conspicuously absent.

03:37.826 --> 03:41.495
No closer to solving the case.

03:49.638 --> 03:53.139
No closer to getting any sleep.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.298
Morning, Godfrey. Thanks.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.967
Janice,
is Stamp still in the tank?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.036
Still babbling away.

04:23.038 --> 04:24.838
Morning, Vaughn.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.674
You gonna be around for
this morning's briefing?

04:27.676 --> 04:29.543
I'll see where my case is at.

04:29.545 --> 04:30.844
They're mandatory.

04:30.846 --> 04:32.245
I'll see where my case is at.

04:32.247 --> 04:34.681
Try to make it!

04:34.683 --> 04:37.984
It's here!
The white one's here!

04:37.986 --> 04:42.122
Hey. You still battling the
Four Horseman of the Apocalypse?

04:42.124 --> 04:43.823
I'm not crazy.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.926
No, of course not.

04:45.928 --> 04:47.627
Now, put these damn pants on

04:47.629 --> 04:50.096
before I start
thinking otherwise.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.193
Janice?

05:21.830 --> 05:23.363
Yes, sir.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.900
Any activity in
the Factory District?

05:26.902 --> 05:28.668
Sorry.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.741
I'm gonna step out real quick.

05:34.743 --> 05:36.843
Uh, Captain Vaughn is...

05:36.845 --> 05:39.312
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Is that what I should tell him?

05:39.314 --> 05:40.981
Tell him whatever you like

05:40.983 --> 05:42.949
because I'll be back
before it's an issue.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.318
Okay. Sounds good.

06:06.341 --> 06:09.976
Evil prick.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.724
Hey, Lacey.

06:57.726 --> 07:01.194
Lacey.

07:01.196 --> 07:03.529
Lacey!

07:03.531 --> 07:05.865
You wanted me to wake you when
the guy with the ring showed up.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.067
Yeah.

07:07.069 --> 07:08.968
The guy with
the ring showed up.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.437
Whoo! Huh?!

08:17.439 --> 08:19.773
Yeah, that's three!
That's three, Tommy Boy!

08:19.775 --> 08:21.040
Huh?

08:24.045 --> 08:26.379
Hey, Tommy...

08:26.381 --> 08:30.450
Now, it's time for your
close-up, baby boy. Yeah!

08:30.452 --> 08:32.152
Yeah, don't move.
Stay right there.

08:32.154 --> 08:33.853
"Hi, Mom."

08:33.855 --> 08:36.289
Right?

08:36.291 --> 08:38.958
Aw, don't be so
fucking serious. Come on.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.895
I need you to...

08:45.000 --> 08:46.900
Fuck, Tommy! Hey!

08:46.902 --> 08:48.802
You pull
the trigger or I do!

08:48.804 --> 08:50.003
Huh?

08:50.005 --> 08:51.204
Yeah.

08:54.342 --> 08:57.811
Come on, you got this.

08:57.813 --> 08:59.379
Ooh, yeah.

09:06.488 --> 09:11.157
Hey, Tommy, there's a lot of
fucking stalling going on here.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.126
Hurry the fuck up!

09:13.128 --> 09:15.428
Yeah, I know. Okay.

09:18.567 --> 09:21.034
Oh, you motherfucker!

09:21.036 --> 09:22.135
You motherfucker!

09:22.137 --> 09:25.471
I can't. I can't.

09:25.473 --> 09:27.073
You're a lucky son of a bitch,

09:27.075 --> 09:29.108
so I'm gonna let
you get away with that.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.946
Yeah, we got a lot
of people watching.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.447
Let's go.

09:39.554 --> 09:42.055
That's a lot of
money around his neck.

09:42.057 --> 09:46.392
All you gotta do
is pull the trigger.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.231
The odds are good.

09:51.233 --> 09:54.601
I know.

09:57.072 --> 09:59.072
You got
no problem killing people.

09:59.074 --> 10:02.942
What's one lousy dog?

10:02.944 --> 10:04.477
Let's go!
You got this!

10:06.615 --> 10:10.083
I know!

10:18.660 --> 10:22.095
Oh, shit!

10:23.598 --> 10:26.532
Oh, shit!

10:26.534 --> 10:30.336
Yo, y'all see this
fucking crazy bitch?!

11:19.287 --> 11:22.322
Go.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.660
Go. Get out of here.

11:29.597 --> 11:32.265
You can't stay
with me.

12:16.478 --> 12:19.445
Help me!

12:27.455 --> 12:30.590
Oh. Jerry, I'm working.

12:30.592 --> 12:33.026
I need help!
I need... I need help!

12:33.028 --> 12:34.327
Shut the fuck up.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.062
I'm talking.
Don't be rude.

12:40.168 --> 12:42.268
As you can see, occupied.

12:42.270 --> 12:45.038
Yeah. No, I know.
Um, Tom's dead.

12:47.509 --> 12:50.610
Hmm.
Okay, well, I mean makes sense.

12:50.612 --> 12:52.278
50-50 chance of that, right?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.680
Yeah, no, no. But I mean, like,
he didn't kill himself.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.749
Some lady just came in
and just fucking, like...

12:56.751 --> 12:59.085
I don't know. Just...

12:59.087 --> 13:00.420
I need... I need help!

13:00.422 --> 13:03.423
I need help.

13:03.425 --> 13:05.558
What did I just say?

13:09.230 --> 13:10.730
Fucking guy...

13:10.732 --> 13:12.598
It's an art what you do.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.600
No, but seriously, boss,
you gotta come see this.

13:14.602 --> 13:18.704
It's fucking nuts.

13:18.706 --> 13:20.373
I don't know, man.
Maybe middle-aged, gruff.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.675
I don't know how to
describe her, man. Maybe a bum.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.078
She doesn't rattle off anything
in your head? Not a client?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.345
- Not a product?
- Oh, no, no.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.081
She definitely
had a look I'd remember.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.415
What's with all this
headshot malarkey?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.484
See, I don't know what
I saw anymore, homie.

13:31.486 --> 13:34.754
Whatever.
We'll shoot her again.

13:34.756 --> 13:36.322
Three-stooged Tom, huh?

13:36.324 --> 13:38.758
Yeah, it was fucked up.

13:43.164 --> 13:45.865
Hello, hello.

13:45.867 --> 13:49.102
Hello.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.716
That's kind of different.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.285
What? What?
What's so different?

14:06.287 --> 14:10.790
Holy mother of fuck!

14:23.705 --> 14:25.171
Hey.

14:27.175 --> 14:29.142
Hey, you got a...

14:31.880 --> 14:34.247
What the hell?

14:48.696 --> 14:51.664
No! please!

15:02.877 --> 15:04.810
Huh.

15:04.812 --> 15:07.480
Jerry...

15:11.319 --> 15:12.451
Jerry.

15:14.756 --> 15:16.656
Jerry.

15:16.658 --> 15:18.624
Yeah. What? Yeah?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.527
Get whatever's
on this off this.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.329
Okay.

15:23.331 --> 15:25.498
Get it to me when you do.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.832
I wanna see that video.

15:26.834 --> 15:27.967
Yeah.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.704
So, uh, this woman did this.

15:31.706 --> 15:34.340
Yeah.

15:34.342 --> 15:36.642
Oh, I'm intrigued.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.746
Jerry.

15:44.886 --> 15:47.320
You, uh,
tell Meredith about this?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.255
Uh-uh. Nope.

15:49.257 --> 15:51.591
Good lad. Don't.

15:51.593 --> 15:53.793
Okay.

15:53.795 --> 15:55.428
Right. Well,
I'm back upstairs.

15:55.430 --> 15:56.529
All right.

15:59.601 --> 16:01.567
You don't wanna stay?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.236
Clean it up!

16:06.874 --> 16:09.008
Man, what did she do
with the fingers?

16:12.513 --> 16:15.715
Like, is this, like,
a message or something?

16:15.717 --> 16:18.251
Fuck.
"Clean it up, Jerry."

16:18.253 --> 16:20.019
Fucking disgusting.

17:31.326 --> 17:33.526
No sense in reporting this.

17:33.528 --> 17:35.661
Who'd believe me?

17:48.543 --> 17:50.343
Top off?

17:53.581 --> 17:55.381
That was tea.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.850
You read the specials?

17:57.852 --> 17:59.985
I just want oatmeal.

17:59.987 --> 18:02.788
I've got eight ounce chopped
steak smothered in gravy -

18:02.790 --> 18:04.056
$8.99.

18:04.058 --> 18:06.892
Half rack baby back ribs -
$12.99.

18:06.894 --> 18:08.627
Is good.

18:08.629 --> 18:12.131
No. Oatmeal.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.632
Will do.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.433
Get your feet off my desk.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.802
I have got something here
you've got to take a gander at.

18:49.804 --> 18:51.570
I'm fine.
I trust your product. Desk.

18:51.572 --> 18:53.072
I consider
it an art.

18:53.074 --> 18:55.007
As long as there's
a market for it.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.809
Seriously, look at this.

18:56.811 --> 18:59.044
Don't worry.
It doesn't star me.

18:59.046 --> 19:00.479
Remember Tom?

19:00.481 --> 19:02.515
Yeah. Did he bite it
with your dog idea?

19:02.517 --> 19:04.016
Love it.
Love your choice of words.

19:04.018 --> 19:07.453
No. He did manage to shoot
a random lady in the face,

19:07.455 --> 19:09.188
only to have his eyes
gouged out

19:09.190 --> 19:11.490
and eaten by
said random lady.

19:11.492 --> 19:13.926
What are you talking about?
Terence, you sound ridiculous.

19:13.928 --> 19:17.062
Just here. Look.

19:23.571 --> 19:25.204
Jesus.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.872
Right?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.641
That's my eighth time viewing.
But look here.

19:28.643 --> 19:32.912
The rest of the world
is way past eight.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.819
So, you don't have a name.

19:39.821 --> 19:41.220
Not yet.
Put out some feelers.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.438
Well, let me know
when you get one.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.657
Well, I've been booting ideas
of what to do with her all day.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.960
Tom, is he disposed of
and a new lock put in?

19:47.962 --> 19:49.662
Yeah, taken care of.

19:49.664 --> 19:51.630
So, what do you think?
Like, PCP?

19:51.632 --> 19:55.568
Well, PCP's not gonna let you
walk off a hole in the head.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.236
That is so interesting.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.472
Right?

20:01.742 --> 20:05.077
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

20:06.881 --> 20:09.081
Terence, this can't happen.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.651
Right.
I'll let Jerry know.

20:12.653 --> 20:14.487
All right.
Anything else?

20:14.489 --> 20:18.090
Oh, yeah. Would it kill you to
call Mom every once and awhile?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.125
Seriously?

20:20.127 --> 20:22.928
We're gonna go see her
at the cabin this weekend.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.663
Yeah, but she's throwing
your guilt my way.

20:24.665 --> 20:26.599
Fine.
I'll call her tonight.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.033
Not tonight.
You'll wake her up.

20:28.035 --> 20:29.802
Fine. In the morning.

20:29.804 --> 20:32.204
Good.
See that you do.

20:51.826 --> 20:55.961
Hey.
Lacey, you look great.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.598
Did you find the guy
you were looking for?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.800
I made do.

21:05.239 --> 21:06.805
Yeah?

21:09.577 --> 21:12.778
Thanks, Lacey.

21:15.216 --> 21:17.283
You sleep, Lacey.
You sleep tight.

21:19.687 --> 21:22.021
I'll keep an eye out
for the guy with the rings.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.827
I got your back.

21:43.578 --> 21:45.611
Hey, buddy.

21:45.613 --> 21:48.047
You got a minute to talk?

21:48.049 --> 21:50.215
No. Hey. No, hey, hey.
Sir, wait a minute.

21:50.217 --> 21:52.618
Wait a minute.
You're not in trouble.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.220
I just wanna...

21:58.225 --> 22:00.159
Holy Christ,
it's you.

22:02.630 --> 22:05.130
Leave me alone.

22:05.132 --> 22:07.166
Hey, you're, uh...

22:09.203 --> 22:13.172
Look, uh, I know that
you don't wanna talk, but...

22:13.174 --> 22:15.674
I don't.

22:15.676 --> 22:18.978
I know, you know, you don't,

22:18.980 --> 22:21.313
but you know I don't...

22:21.315 --> 22:22.915
What is it?

22:22.917 --> 22:26.352
Money? Food?
A place to live?

22:26.354 --> 22:30.022
How 'bout some more fingers,
you fuckin' maniac?

22:34.161 --> 22:35.728
Look...

22:35.730 --> 22:37.663
I don't even know

22:37.665 --> 22:38.931
what that means, okay?

22:38.933 --> 22:42.167
I just wanna talk.

22:44.171 --> 22:47.906
Yesterday, I watched you go
into that building alone.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.109
You came out with a head wound.

22:50.111 --> 22:54.113
And now, you're looking
fully healed.

22:54.115 --> 22:56.982
I mean, I can't do that.

22:58.219 --> 23:00.686
So, I assumed
you're the one that...

23:00.688 --> 23:02.354
Yeah, I killed that guy.

23:02.356 --> 23:03.956
Why?

23:03.958 --> 23:06.091
I wanted to eat him.

23:07.862 --> 23:09.061
What?

23:09.063 --> 23:11.230
Well,
parts of him.

23:11.232 --> 23:12.798
Parts of him?

23:15.803 --> 23:18.671
I gotta ask.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.374
Why the fingers?

23:22.376 --> 23:26.211
They're easier to carry and I
need the bone marrow.

23:26.213 --> 23:28.781
Bone marrow.

23:30.084 --> 23:34.687
I-I had it roasted on toast,

23:34.689 --> 23:36.889
but that was from a cow.

23:36.891 --> 23:39.692
That's why I could
use a fridge.

23:39.694 --> 23:41.894
For people?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.265
You two ready?

23:46.267 --> 23:48.133
Oatmeal.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.902
Oatmeal.

23:49.904 --> 23:51.770
I thought you'd gravitate
towards protein.

23:51.772 --> 23:53.972
I don't
technically eat meat.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.874
Oh!

23:55.876 --> 23:57.109
What can I get you?

23:57.111 --> 23:59.478
Uh, yeah,
whatever she's having.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.314
Yeah, oatmeal.
Oatmeal's fine.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.816
Two oatmeal coming up.

24:05.419 --> 24:09.188
Look, I'm not gonna dance
around the subject here.

24:09.190 --> 24:13.425
You... admitted
murder to a cop.

24:13.427 --> 24:16.295
I wanna know why
you killed that guy.

24:16.297 --> 24:18.831
He wasn't my first choice.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.499
Who was your first choice?

24:20.501 --> 24:23.001
The man with rings.

24:25.439 --> 24:30.109
A big guy who
always dresses in black,

24:30.111 --> 24:33.779
he's got rings on
all his fingers?

24:34.915 --> 24:37.449
Terrance Remander.

24:37.451 --> 24:41.787
You were gonna eat
Terrance Remander? Why him?

24:43.257 --> 24:45.824
I saw him throw a plastic
bag over a woman's head

24:45.826 --> 24:48.193
and drag her into a van.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.796
Plus, he has long femurs.

24:50.798 --> 24:52.464
Long femurs.

24:52.466 --> 24:54.233
Oh.

24:54.235 --> 24:56.835
More, um, marrow.

24:56.837 --> 24:59.071
Mm-hmm.

25:00.307 --> 25:02.875
Is there a point to all this?

25:07.548 --> 25:12.484
Look, I'm not gonna arrest you,
if that's what you mean.

25:12.486 --> 25:13.986
Uh, I'm off the clock.

25:13.988 --> 25:17.556
There's not gonna be any
judgement, legal or moral.

25:17.558 --> 25:21.794
This is an ongoing
investigation.

25:21.796 --> 25:25.164
Since we're both interested
in the same party...

25:25.166 --> 25:27.232
Terence.

25:28.969 --> 25:31.136
...maybe we can make a trade.

25:32.940 --> 25:35.507
Like what?

25:35.509 --> 25:38.977
How 'bout we upgrade
you to a fridge?

25:48.489 --> 25:51.290
Have you been awake
the whole 24 hours here?

25:51.292 --> 25:53.425
Dude, I can't
get over this lady.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.828
I've been digging for
dirt all day long - nothing.

25:55.830 --> 25:58.297
I despise it when
you call me "dude."

25:58.299 --> 26:01.033
"Dude", it's a word I use
when I'm jubilant.

26:01.035 --> 26:03.135
"Jubilant."

26:03.137 --> 26:04.536
Enough of a fucking
vocabulary for ya?

26:04.538 --> 26:06.905
I prefer "exuberant."

26:06.907 --> 26:09.408
Exuberant.
Of course you do, cunt.

26:09.410 --> 26:12.945
Oh, that's nice. Classy.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.984
Hey, wait up.

26:20.421 --> 26:21.920
How's your Friday looking?

26:21.922 --> 26:23.589
Substantial.

26:23.591 --> 26:26.091
What happens if we
cross pollinate a bit?

26:26.093 --> 26:28.460
Invite my clientele if -
and this is a massive if -

26:28.462 --> 26:30.329
we find her.

26:30.331 --> 26:32.464
What would be
the benefit of that?

26:32.466 --> 26:35.434
Well, my people want product,
your people have it.

26:35.436 --> 26:37.636
We exchange business cards.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.438
Why does Girl X even matter?

26:39.440 --> 26:43.041
"Girl X."
I like it.

26:43.043 --> 26:44.476
It's apt.

26:44.478 --> 26:47.145
Hmm.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.214
Well, she could
be a special guest.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.483
Have her do a red room

26:51.485 --> 26:54.119
or participate in one.

26:54.121 --> 26:56.622
Maybe she's cool.
If she's not,

26:56.624 --> 26:59.458
fuck it, we ship her off to
whoever pays the most. Huh?

26:59.460 --> 27:03.562
There's little to no demand
for middle-aged women.

27:03.564 --> 27:08.000
Oh, my dear sister,
I get it.

27:08.002 --> 27:10.302
But she's a celebrity.
She'll have appeal.

27:11.972 --> 27:14.172
Give me some time
to think about it.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.074
Cool.

27:16.076 --> 27:17.209
How's your tooth?

27:17.211 --> 27:18.543
Killing me.

27:18.545 --> 27:21.013
But you're eating sugar
encased in sugar.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.081
My goal is implants,
all of 'em.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.318
Well, I guess implants
wouldn't get cavities.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.320
Exactly.

27:28.322 --> 27:31.156
You gonna be awake enough
for the shipment this morning?

27:32.660 --> 27:35.527
Of course.

27:42.136 --> 27:43.969
I, uh...

27:43.971 --> 27:47.172
I got this place
before I was married.

27:52.112 --> 27:54.046
I considered
moving in myself,

27:54.048 --> 27:57.082
you know, after my divorce,
but never happened.

27:57.084 --> 27:59.184
Um...

27:59.186 --> 28:02.387
I know it's a dump,

28:02.389 --> 28:05.090
but, uh...

28:05.092 --> 28:07.559
it's better than
the alley, huh?

28:09.029 --> 28:11.129
Jesus,

28:11.131 --> 28:14.166
I can't believe we've
gotten this far without names.

28:14.168 --> 28:16.635
I'm, uh...

28:16.637 --> 28:20.405
I'm Godfrey.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.607
And your name is...?

28:22.609 --> 28:25.477
Lacey.

28:25.479 --> 28:26.678
Okay, Lacey.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.481
This is also for you.

28:33.620 --> 28:38.090
Uh, okay, look,
when you open it -

28:38.092 --> 28:40.225
and I hope that's
gonna be soon -

28:40.227 --> 28:42.761
there's a couple
of photographs in here.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.666
Uh, one of them you know -
Terence.

28:50.204 --> 28:53.672
The, uh, second photo -
first name Paul,

28:53.674 --> 28:56.074
a known associate.

28:56.076 --> 28:59.344
I want him...

28:59.346 --> 29:03.448
look, I don't know what's
usually on your menu,

29:03.450 --> 29:06.151
but I want him gone.

29:06.153 --> 29:10.288
Do you understand what
I'm offering here?

29:11.692 --> 29:14.626
You want me to kill him.

29:14.628 --> 29:18.630
Yeah. Yeah,
I want you to kill him. Yeah.

29:18.632 --> 29:23.602
I want you to kill him.

29:26.540 --> 29:29.107
Can I eat him?

29:29.109 --> 29:32.110
Ye... yeah, sure.

29:32.112 --> 29:34.246
You can.
You can eat him.

29:55.069 --> 29:57.202
Hey.

29:57.204 --> 29:59.271
Can I help you?

30:01.175 --> 30:03.408
Who are you?

30:03.410 --> 30:04.709
Do you wear glasses?

30:04.711 --> 30:06.344
What?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.213
Reading glasses.

30:08.215 --> 30:10.615
Um, I don't know
what the hell you...

30:20.360 --> 30:22.661
Oh, good.

30:36.677 --> 30:38.443
I'm sorry.

30:47.254 --> 30:50.188
Yo! No! Stay away!

30:51.625 --> 30:53.792
Okay.

31:32.366 --> 31:33.698
Oh, hey. Sir?

31:34.835 --> 31:37.669
Hey, Janice.
How you doing?

31:37.671 --> 31:39.538
Not bad. I'm just
heading out for the night.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.673
I don't know if Vaughn
got a hold of you,

31:41.675 --> 31:44.576
but he wanted you to
come in early tomorrow.

31:47.481 --> 31:50.582
You...
How are you?

31:50.584 --> 31:52.517
Janice...

31:52.519 --> 31:54.252
Yes, sir.

31:54.254 --> 31:56.588
Do you think it takes some time

31:56.590 --> 31:59.658
to realize you've done
the worst thing in your life?

32:00.827 --> 32:03.228
Or should you have
known immediately?

32:07.367 --> 32:10.202
You know, I think you
just need some sleep.

32:23.383 --> 32:24.583
Hello.

32:24.585 --> 32:28.453
Godfrey? It's Lacey.

32:28.455 --> 32:30.855
Lacey.

32:30.857 --> 32:34.960
How's it going?
Jesus. It's late.

32:34.962 --> 32:38.997
Okay.
Paul's dead.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.366
Jesus, that was fast.

32:41.368 --> 32:43.635
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:43.637 --> 32:45.737
You, uh... you took
care of everything?

32:45.739 --> 32:47.706
Yeah.

32:47.708 --> 32:50.342
<i>Any complications?</i>

32:50.344 --> 32:52.711
Yeah. Well, no.

32:52.713 --> 32:54.646
<i>There was a girl
in his apartment.</i>

32:54.648 --> 32:57.649
What did you do?

32:57.651 --> 33:00.285
<i>Nothing.</i>

33:00.287 --> 33:04.689
Oh. What did she do?
Did she call the cops?

33:04.691 --> 33:06.558
<i>Where is she?</i>

33:06.560 --> 33:08.426
She's handcuffed to a bed.

33:08.428 --> 33:11.429
You... you handcuffed
her to a bed?

33:11.431 --> 33:14.666
No. That's how I found her.

33:14.668 --> 33:16.001
<i>Paul and the other guy...</i>

33:16.003 --> 33:17.369
There was another guy?

33:17.371 --> 33:18.703
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:18.705 --> 33:19.804
But he's also dead.

33:19.806 --> 33:21.640
<i>Look.</i>

33:21.642 --> 33:23.508
First of all,
we can't leave a girl

33:23.510 --> 33:25.677
handcuffed to the bed, okay?
Second of all,

33:25.679 --> 33:28.313
this is supposed to be an off
the record endeavour.

33:28.315 --> 33:29.714
<i>I mean, she's
witness to a crime</i>

33:29.716 --> 33:31.483
<i>that wasn't supposed to exist.</i>

33:31.485 --> 33:33.785
<i>So, we somehow gotta
get her on the same page.</i>

33:33.787 --> 33:36.488
That doesn't sound possible.

33:36.490 --> 33:38.823
Well, look,
we've got to cover our asses

33:38.825 --> 33:40.458
if we within get away with this.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.794
You want me to un-cuff her?

33:44.464 --> 33:48.900
Yeah. Un-cuff her and stay
with her and get back to me.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.468
Oh, fuck.

34:30.877 --> 34:32.911
No! No!

34:32.913 --> 34:34.846
Get the fuck back, you fucking
zombie, robot motherfucker!

34:34.848 --> 34:37.682
Get the fuck back!
Back the fuck up!

34:37.684 --> 34:39.551
Fuck you! Fuck you!

34:49.363 --> 34:52.497
You can go.

34:52.499 --> 34:54.833
Really?

34:54.835 --> 34:57.635
I guess.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.771
Are... are you okay?

35:00.974 --> 35:02.807
I guess.

35:20.560 --> 35:24.796
I still have it... I will.

35:27.801 --> 35:30.535
I used their storage bins.

35:30.537 --> 35:32.871
They're in there.

35:32.873 --> 35:34.572
It's only ever men,

35:34.574 --> 35:37.041
coke addicted men.

35:39.913 --> 35:43.148
Without a question,
I can taste the difference.

35:43.150 --> 35:45.016
I'm also foggy
in the morning.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.888
I don't know.
I didn't ask her.

35:58.932 --> 36:00.532
You have options.

36:00.534 --> 36:03.034
Okey-dokey.

36:03.036 --> 36:06.771
You can forget this ever
happened and not tell anyone.

36:08.008 --> 36:10.842
Kinda hard to forget.

36:10.844 --> 36:13.978
You could call Detective
Godfrey on this number.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.580
And what would that do?

36:15.582 --> 36:19.184
I didn't get that far.

36:19.186 --> 36:21.119
Wait. We're done?

36:21.121 --> 36:22.587
I am.

36:22.589 --> 36:23.988
Yeah, but...

36:23.990 --> 36:25.957
you saved me.

36:32.065 --> 36:35.133
Ahh... fuck.

36:35.135 --> 36:37.135
There you are.

36:37.137 --> 36:39.003
Where are your boys?

36:39.005 --> 36:41.806
I'm trying Jerry
for, like, the 20th time,

36:41.808 --> 36:44.676
but he's not calling.

36:44.678 --> 36:45.944
You're useless.

36:45.946 --> 36:47.912
It's like a block away.
Go over there.

36:52.118 --> 36:55.019
"Go over there."

36:55.021 --> 36:58.189
As you wish.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.699
Coffee?

37:07.701 --> 37:09.834
Wait. Hot tea.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.504
Hot tea.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.906
Hey.

37:14.908 --> 37:16.040
Take a seat anywhere.

37:16.042 --> 37:17.742
You got it.

37:24.918 --> 37:26.951
So, what are you?

37:28.588 --> 37:31.089
Like... are you just a jacked up
lady blitzed out of her mind?

37:31.091 --> 37:33.124
Or a government
experiment on the lam? Or...

37:33.126 --> 37:34.225
Please leave.

37:34.227 --> 37:35.693
- Robot?
- No.

37:35.695 --> 37:36.861
- Zombie?
- No.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.096
- Vampire?
- I'm not a vampire.

37:38.098 --> 37:40.298
You sound like a vampire.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.901
- Why do I have to be a thing?
- You drink blood, right?

37:42.903 --> 37:45.236
- It sounds like you drink blood.
- I don't.

37:45.238 --> 37:47.138
Oh.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.240
Why aren't you somewhere else,
being traumatized?

37:52.145 --> 37:56.281
Well, for starters,
that's old hat.

37:56.283 --> 37:59.984
And, if you must know, I get
taken advantage of most days.

37:59.986 --> 38:03.655
So, to see a person,
a woman,

38:03.657 --> 38:08.192
a woman like you
twist those guys in half

38:08.194 --> 38:11.930
is, uh...
I don't know.

38:11.932 --> 38:15.199
I don't know, but it's good.

38:15.201 --> 38:18.236
I eat people.
It's not the same.

38:18.238 --> 38:19.971
Holy shit!

38:19.973 --> 38:21.739
Please keep your voice down.

38:21.741 --> 38:23.074
What do you expect
me to do?

38:23.076 --> 38:24.909
You show up and
straight up merc the dipshits

38:24.911 --> 38:27.078
who were gonna ship me off in
crate, all the while,

38:27.080 --> 38:28.613
not even flinching during a
fucking shivving.

38:28.615 --> 38:29.964
Dipshit...

38:29.966 --> 38:31.316
Like, sorry, if you spark
some curiosity.

38:31.318 --> 38:33.084
Mmm... Dipshits...

38:34.754 --> 38:36.120
Dipshits...

38:36.122 --> 38:37.622
Coffee?

38:37.624 --> 38:38.923
Sure thing.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.191
Menus?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.360
I'm getting something.
Yeah. How 'bout you?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.963
Do you eat... food?

38:44.965 --> 38:47.832
I don't like you.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.802
I'll be back in a minute.

38:50.804 --> 38:53.905
So... you're super.

38:53.907 --> 38:57.208
I wouldn't say I'm super.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.710
Oh, come on.

38:58.712 --> 39:00.612
If you're not, what's with
the zipped up jacket?

39:00.614 --> 39:03.681
Show me your wounds.

39:09.856 --> 39:14.292
Wow...
You heal fast.

39:14.294 --> 39:16.828
Yeah.

40:07.681 --> 40:09.814
Oh...

40:56.029 --> 40:59.397
Jesus Christ!

41:26.326 --> 41:28.192
Don't I know you?

41:29.362 --> 41:31.195
Sam Spade.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.864
Stay right where you are!

41:35.869 --> 41:36.934
Please stop that.

41:36.936 --> 41:38.870
Sorry.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.371
You just kind of
shatter my world.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.940
Like, everything
is different now.

41:42.942 --> 41:44.342
- It's not.
- How is it not?

41:44.344 --> 41:47.411
You... you defy everything
I know about anything.

41:47.413 --> 41:49.247
- I don't.
- How?

41:49.249 --> 41:52.116
It's all the same.
It never stops.

41:52.118 --> 41:56.254
Whoa. That is a
depressing bumper sticker.

41:56.256 --> 41:59.157
I wouldn't worry, though.
The end is nigh.

41:59.159 --> 42:01.058
It's not.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.027
Are you sure? Nonstop wars

42:03.029 --> 42:06.130
and crazy climate shit
not an indicator?

42:06.132 --> 42:09.066
Every generation says that,
but every generation is wrong.

42:25.185 --> 42:28.186
What are we doing here?

42:42.035 --> 42:45.903
So, sounds like you've
been around a while.

42:47.841 --> 42:50.942
Holy fuck!

42:50.944 --> 42:53.411
Yeah, you have.
Of course you have.

42:53.413 --> 42:56.113
I'm not having
this conversation.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.115
Copy that.
Sensitive issue.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.218
At least your
scars heal, though.

43:02.856 --> 43:05.189
Do you find it helpful?

43:07.427 --> 43:10.561
The cutting?

43:10.563 --> 43:12.029
Yeah.

43:12.031 --> 43:14.899
I don't know.

43:14.901 --> 43:19.637
I mean, in the moment, maybe.
There's not one I don't regret.

43:21.207 --> 43:24.976
They're not all me, though.
About a third were me.

43:24.978 --> 43:26.344
The other third,

43:26.346 --> 43:28.546
I was paid to let some sadist
get their rocks off.

43:28.548 --> 43:32.316
And the last third,

43:32.318 --> 43:34.518
just some
run of the mill assholes.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.488
I still have scars
that will never heal.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.357
You do?

43:39.359 --> 43:43.461
Two. I forget they're there
sometimes, but they're there.

43:43.463 --> 43:46.898
Did you get them before you
changed or something?

43:46.900 --> 43:50.368
I never changed.
They're just there.

43:50.370 --> 43:52.570
Huh.

43:52.572 --> 43:56.007
Really?

43:56.009 --> 43:59.543
So...
you live around here?

43:59.545 --> 44:02.280
Please feel free to
say no to this, but...

44:02.282 --> 44:03.547
Do I have a choice?

44:03.549 --> 44:05.283
...do you have a bathroom?

44:05.285 --> 44:08.052
Wait. Because I really wouldn't
mind freshening up,

44:08.054 --> 44:11.222
and you could totally
use a shower, too.

44:16.062 --> 44:19.130
Nice.

44:19.132 --> 44:21.699
Minimalist.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.701
But I'm gonna guess
it wasn't by choice.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.975
Uh... Oh,
is that the bathroom?

44:32.712 --> 44:35.379
Cool, cool.

44:37.984 --> 44:40.451
Yep, it is.

44:49.529 --> 44:52.163
Okay.

45:11.150 --> 45:12.616
You seem like you're pretty
lonely, you know?

45:12.618 --> 45:14.085
You could maybe use a friend.

45:14.087 --> 45:17.655
So, you wanna
watch a movie tonight?

45:17.657 --> 45:20.191
Okay, so, here's the thing -

45:20.193 --> 45:23.027
I'm really good
at making breakfast.

45:24.230 --> 45:27.098
Your couch looks
really comfortable. I mean...

45:27.100 --> 45:32.236
I'm a really good cook, and I'm actually,
like, a pro at making breakfast.

45:32.238 --> 45:34.338
So, if you
just let me stay the night,

45:34.340 --> 45:36.273
I could make you breakfast.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.509
Friends hang out sometimes.

45:38.511 --> 45:40.177
I need a friend,
you need a friend.

45:40.179 --> 45:41.579
We need to be friends.

45:41.581 --> 45:43.347
Why don't we just
hang out tonight?

45:43.349 --> 45:45.683
What are you doing tonight?

45:48.287 --> 45:51.188
What are you doing tonight?

46:08.174 --> 46:10.674
So, what are you doing tonight?

46:16.716 --> 46:18.315
You should go.

46:25.758 --> 46:29.193
Really?

46:33.666 --> 46:37.334
Okay.

47:14.140 --> 47:15.573
Oh, shit.

48:25.511 --> 48:28.245
You're in good shape
for a man your age.

48:28.247 --> 48:31.348
Yeah.
Lotta good it did me.

48:31.350 --> 48:35.319
It's what you don't see. Resting
heartrate, intestinal health, blood sugar.

48:35.321 --> 48:38.522
Try to keep up with the fibre,

48:38.524 --> 48:40.758
do the occasional sit-up.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.259
That must help in your field.

48:42.261 --> 48:43.561
You're a homicide
detective, right?

48:43.563 --> 48:45.496
Yes, I am.

48:46.933 --> 48:47.965
Charlie Godfrey.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.733
Yep.

48:49.735 --> 48:52.203
Do you know who I am?

48:52.205 --> 48:54.972
I haven't seen you
before in my life.

48:54.974 --> 48:58.676
Hmm.
But you know who Terrance is.

48:58.678 --> 48:59.977
By proxy.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.612
And how's that,
Detective?

49:01.614 --> 49:03.214
He's a potential suspect

49:03.216 --> 49:05.549
in a pending
criminal investigation.

49:05.551 --> 49:09.587
A potential suspect.
And what criminal offence

49:09.589 --> 49:12.957
would Terrance be a potential suspect
of that would justify surveillance?

49:12.959 --> 49:17.461
I have reason to believe he's
part of a human trafficking ring.

49:17.463 --> 49:19.930
That's cute.

49:19.932 --> 49:22.833
What's cute about it?

49:22.835 --> 49:25.936
So, it would be safe to assume
that when my brother found you,

49:25.938 --> 49:28.405
you were acting
of your own accord.

49:28.407 --> 49:30.808
Your brother?

49:30.810 --> 49:33.244
Yes, sir.
Because from what I've seen,

49:33.246 --> 49:38.415
there's no record of interest of a Terrance
Remander in this district's police department,

49:38.417 --> 49:40.818
nor of a Paul Hoover,
despite his history.

49:40.820 --> 49:44.955
So, can you tell me what you were doing
in his apartment without a warrant?

49:44.957 --> 49:49.426
- What makes you think the department...
- 'Cause 34 percent of our annual revenue goes to law enforcement.

49:52.932 --> 49:54.565
Ouch.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.410
Who did you say you were again?

50:06.412 --> 50:09.647
Meredith Remander and that
should concern you.

50:09.649 --> 50:12.650
Why's that, Meredith?

50:12.652 --> 50:17.554
That someone such as me is being this lax
with information to a police detective.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.823
I have no illusions
about my safety.

50:19.825 --> 50:21.325
Smart.

50:21.327 --> 50:24.061
So, then, is this
about your daughter?

50:24.063 --> 50:26.463
- What?
- Chelsea Godfrey.

50:26.465 --> 50:29.600
She went missing in 2000
with no trace.

50:29.602 --> 50:31.635
That's right.

50:31.637 --> 50:33.904
And so, you thought us.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.940
We have a pretty substantial
accounting of our records.

50:36.942 --> 50:38.542
I couldn't find her.

50:38.544 --> 50:40.811
All signs pointed to that
she, I don't know,

50:40.813 --> 50:43.914
just fucked off because
of troubles at home.

50:43.916 --> 50:47.318
Now, as for Terrance and I,

50:47.320 --> 50:48.719
we do work together,

50:48.721 --> 50:51.422
but the trafficking is more
my side of the spectrum.

50:51.424 --> 50:54.391
He's in fetish and snuff.

50:54.393 --> 50:57.594
Now, as for your daughter,

50:57.596 --> 51:00.397
I'm sorry,
I have nothing to offer you.

51:00.399 --> 51:02.666
First...

51:06.472 --> 51:09.440
There was a time I considered
something like you.

51:09.442 --> 51:12.509
But for a few years now,

51:12.511 --> 51:14.111
I've known where
my daughter Chelsea is.

51:14.113 --> 51:17.081
She's fine.
With her own family.

51:17.083 --> 51:18.916
It's only a sense of guilt

51:18.918 --> 51:22.686
and not knowing what to say to
her that's keeping us apart.

51:24.123 --> 51:27.024
Second,
do I really need a reason

51:27.026 --> 51:29.727
to want people like you dead?

51:29.729 --> 51:31.995
Well, that's not very nice.

51:31.997 --> 51:35.632
Third...

51:35.634 --> 51:38.001
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

51:38.003 --> 51:41.538
Hmm. Well,
this has been interesting.

51:41.540 --> 51:44.875
That's my cue.

51:44.877 --> 51:46.076
I'm done.

51:48.080 --> 51:51.482
Anything juicy?

51:52.618 --> 51:53.817
He eats fibre.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.120
Scandalous.

51:57.123 --> 52:00.124
Good luck.

52:00.126 --> 52:01.859
I'll be in my office.

52:10.569 --> 52:14.104
Now, you're going to tell me

52:14.106 --> 52:17.141
everything I need
to know about her.

52:36.028 --> 52:38.595
Looks like it's just
you and me now.

52:39.899 --> 52:42.099
You wanna go first?

52:42.101 --> 52:45.602
Don't mind if I do.

53:28.848 --> 53:32.883
Please stop.

53:36.155 --> 53:38.922
Do it.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.559
Do it.

54:18.030 --> 54:21.098
Yo, Lacey.

54:21.100 --> 54:23.767
I hear you've been
looking for me.

54:23.769 --> 54:27.571
Well, I've been
looking for you, too.

54:29.575 --> 54:32.676
Here we go.

54:35.114 --> 54:37.247
Whoa!

54:37.249 --> 54:39.983
Well, hello,
pretty lady.

54:43.722 --> 54:46.924
Ooh...
You can take a hit.

54:50.029 --> 54:51.562
Again, dipshit.

54:51.564 --> 54:52.863
Say what now?

54:52.865 --> 54:54.231
Again!

54:59.672 --> 55:01.638
Hit me again.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.207
Okay. Sure.

55:05.177 --> 55:09.079
Holy shit!
Oh my God, oh my God.

55:09.081 --> 55:10.948
Oh!

55:18.824 --> 55:21.124
Are you Trevor?

55:21.126 --> 55:23.994
Terrance.

55:23.996 --> 55:26.730
Is this a part of the
kidnapping or something?

55:26.732 --> 55:28.765
That's the idea, yeah.

55:28.767 --> 55:30.734
Why don't I just go with you?

55:35.941 --> 55:38.108
Can I take another swing?

55:39.211 --> 55:41.678
My retina got detached.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.281
So, you know,
if you hit me again,

55:44.283 --> 55:47.250
then my eye, I'll lose it, and
eyes take awhile to grow back.

55:47.252 --> 55:48.819
Wait. What?

55:48.821 --> 55:50.721
I just wanna avoid that.

55:51.790 --> 55:54.057
All right, well,
I'm parked right here.

55:57.663 --> 56:00.097
What the fuck was that?

56:00.099 --> 56:03.400
Dude, that was
fucking insane.

56:05.704 --> 56:06.837
Oh, fuck.

56:12.945 --> 56:15.746
Three, two, one.

56:16.949 --> 56:18.782
Shuffle.

56:18.784 --> 56:21.018
What does she eat?
Oh my God.

56:21.020 --> 56:22.653
Wait, wait, wait.
Put her down.

56:22.655 --> 56:24.821
You little B.

56:24.823 --> 56:27.024
Up.
Lift with your legs.

56:27.026 --> 56:28.191
Lift with your legs. Okay.

56:28.193 --> 56:30.227
Wait.
Let me get that door.

56:34.299 --> 56:35.832
Ah.

56:35.834 --> 56:37.034
Hello.

56:37.036 --> 56:38.869
Hello, ma'am.
How can I help you?

56:38.871 --> 56:40.170
Uh,

56:40.172 --> 56:44.107
I'm looking for
a Detective Godfrey?

56:44.109 --> 56:45.976
Uh, Godfrey's not at
the department at the moment.

56:45.978 --> 56:47.310
Is it an emergency?

56:47.312 --> 56:50.747
Kind of, yeah.

56:50.749 --> 56:52.949
But, uh, this is more
of a Godfrey thing.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.918
Okay. Do you want to
leave a statement

56:54.920 --> 56:56.420
and I could forward
it to his office?

56:56.422 --> 56:59.122
Do you know where he is
or how I can contact him?

56:59.124 --> 57:01.958
I've tried both of his numbers
and I'm not getting anything.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.428
Well, if you can't
reach him, then...

57:04.430 --> 57:05.862
Why is Detective Godfrey

57:05.864 --> 57:07.464
so pertinent to
your statement, miss?

57:07.466 --> 57:10.267
Um, he helped me out
with something

57:10.269 --> 57:12.235
and I want to thank him.

57:12.237 --> 57:16.273
Detective Godfrey is no longer
affiliated with this department.

57:16.275 --> 57:18.308
His services are in the
process of termination.

57:18.310 --> 57:20.711
If you want to contact him,

57:20.713 --> 57:24.281
it'll be best for you to
pursue him personally.

57:24.283 --> 57:26.717
So...

57:26.719 --> 57:29.853
if you don't have an emergency,

57:29.855 --> 57:33.356
I'd like to ask you to
please exit the premises.

57:36.495 --> 57:39.229
Do you know how I can
contact him personally?

57:39.231 --> 57:42.132
Not my responsibility, miss.

57:46.038 --> 57:47.370
Why are you
looking for him?

57:47.372 --> 57:49.072
I'm not actually sure.

57:49.074 --> 57:50.941
I'm gonna need
more than that.

57:50.943 --> 57:53.443
I don't know what I'm
allowed to say.

57:53.445 --> 57:55.178
I just know he's important.

57:55.180 --> 57:56.980
Okay. Do you see that
hallway behind me?

57:56.982 --> 57:58.315
Yeah.

57:58.317 --> 58:00.050
Get to the last
door on the left,

58:00.052 --> 58:01.918
go in that office,
close the door behind you

58:01.920 --> 58:05.255
and I'll meet
you there shortly.

58:05.257 --> 58:07.157
Like now.

58:07.159 --> 58:09.993
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

58:32.451 --> 58:35.185
That was nuts.
I feel like a spy.

58:35.187 --> 58:36.353
Okay, first things first -

58:36.355 --> 58:38.188
I can't get a hold
of Godfrey either.

58:38.190 --> 58:40.023
I haven't seen him
since last night.

58:40.025 --> 58:42.859
- No one here seems to care.
- Okay. Scary.

58:42.861 --> 58:45.529
Okay, I just need you
to be candid with me.

58:45.531 --> 58:46.997
Why are you looking for him?

58:46.999 --> 58:49.900
Uh...

58:49.902 --> 58:51.968
Look, I just wanna
make sure he's okay.

58:51.970 --> 58:56.506
I hope he's better than
who I'm looking for.

59:06.018 --> 59:07.450
Well, that's different.

59:07.452 --> 59:09.486
I know right?

59:11.423 --> 59:13.356
So, this is it.

59:15.561 --> 59:18.395
And you're telling me

59:18.397 --> 59:22.599
that its head was not in this
shape when you brought it in.

59:22.601 --> 59:25.035
You can see brains.

59:25.037 --> 59:27.504
How is that even possible.

59:27.506 --> 59:29.172
Either way,
I'd keep my distance.

59:34.913 --> 59:39.382
Wow. Charming!

59:39.384 --> 59:41.017
So, what do you think?

59:41.019 --> 59:42.485
I think it's an absurd
amount of restraints.

59:42.487 --> 59:45.055
Well, I'm sure Paul thought

59:45.057 --> 59:47.123
the lock on his
door was enough, too,

59:47.125 --> 59:48.892
but now, his head's
facing the other way.

59:48.894 --> 59:51.294
Guess how much she weighs.

59:51.296 --> 59:55.432
I'd say somewhere
between 132 and 135.

59:55.434 --> 59:57.534
Close. 247 on the dot.

59:57.536 --> 59:59.970
That makes no sense, Terrance.

59:59.972 --> 1:00:01.404
Swear to God.

1:00:01.406 --> 1:00:02.873
Imagine our surprise

1:00:02.875 --> 1:00:05.008
when we were trying to
hoist her into the van.

1:00:05.010 --> 1:00:06.576
She's one dense little bird.

1:00:07.913 --> 1:00:09.880
So, you want a red room.

1:00:09.882 --> 1:00:11.381
For reals?

1:00:11.383 --> 1:00:13.516
How you gonna transport it?

1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:19.289
Well, she's gonna need
to be unconscious and secured.

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:22.058
I will need someone to help
carry her, though.

1:00:22.060 --> 1:00:24.961
Fine. We'll do a live one at
tonight's reception,

1:00:24.963 --> 1:00:26.997
and if it goes well,
then I'll auction it off.

1:00:26.999 --> 1:00:28.999
Thank you.

1:00:29.001 --> 1:00:30.667
Do it soon.

1:00:30.669 --> 1:00:34.404
What was that, Lacey?

1:00:36.041 --> 1:00:37.307
Leave me here.

1:00:37.309 --> 1:00:39.643
Why would we do that?

1:00:41.513 --> 1:00:42.913
I lost it.

1:00:42.915 --> 1:00:45.015
Lose what?

1:00:45.017 --> 1:00:47.017
Seriously, what you got?

1:00:47.019 --> 1:00:49.352
Your mind? Your edge?
Your bowels? Hmm?

1:00:49.354 --> 1:00:51.221
What is it?

1:00:51.223 --> 1:00:53.423
Hmm?

1:00:53.425 --> 1:00:54.958
Hey.

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:58.094
Back to test pattern.

1:00:58.096 --> 1:01:00.630
Fine. I'll start making calls.

1:01:00.632 --> 1:01:02.032
Terrance...

1:01:06.371 --> 1:01:09.472
You make sure you don't
overindulge, okay?

1:01:11.476 --> 1:01:15.578
Take a nap.
You look like shit.

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:46.643
Speaking of bowels

1:01:46.645 --> 1:01:48.211
and shit, Lacey,

1:01:48.213 --> 1:01:50.513
what's gonna be in yours
with your diet, hmm?

1:01:52.084 --> 1:01:53.550
Your teeth.

1:01:56.722 --> 1:02:00.056
Good.
Fuckin' thing is killing me.

1:02:05.163 --> 1:02:07.130
Yup, that's him.

1:02:07.132 --> 1:02:08.398
You're sure?

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:11.167
Well, he never stood
like that for me, but yeah,

1:02:11.169 --> 1:02:13.336
looks like him.

1:02:13.338 --> 1:02:15.572
Detective Godfrey's been staking
him out in the Factory District.

1:02:15.574 --> 1:02:18.208
Brought him in a few years back
on a human trafficking link,

1:02:18.210 --> 1:02:19.609
but nothing ever came of it.

1:02:19.611 --> 1:02:21.711
I can guarantee you
this dude's into that.

1:02:21.713 --> 1:02:23.213
How?

1:02:23.215 --> 1:02:24.481
That guy.

1:02:24.483 --> 1:02:26.316
I, uh, used to do
some work for him

1:02:26.318 --> 1:02:28.184
and he dabbled
into shit like that.

1:02:28.186 --> 1:02:29.753
What kind of work?

1:02:29.755 --> 1:02:32.188
Uh...

1:02:32.190 --> 1:02:35.525
Okay, but if something
were to come of this,

1:02:35.527 --> 1:02:37.327
would you be willing to testify?

1:02:37.329 --> 1:02:38.361
Yeah, no. Not at all.

1:02:38.363 --> 1:02:39.662
Why not?

1:02:39.664 --> 1:02:41.598
Because I know where this
guy is right now

1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:43.549
and I know people like me

1:02:43.551 --> 1:02:45.501
talking to people like you
end up where this guy is.

1:02:47.172 --> 1:02:48.705
Yeah.

1:02:48.707 --> 1:02:51.641
Well, where you going?

1:02:51.643 --> 1:02:54.744
I don't know, but thank you.

1:02:54.746 --> 1:02:56.713
This was enlightening.

1:02:56.715 --> 1:02:58.581
Got your card.

1:03:09.494 --> 1:03:13.797
Hmm.

1:03:18.303 --> 1:03:20.703
I keep catching you staring off
into the distance.

1:03:20.705 --> 1:03:22.272
What are you looking at?

1:03:24.376 --> 1:03:25.775
Every once and awhile,

1:03:25.777 --> 1:03:29.612
I can see someone that
no one else can see.

1:03:32.384 --> 1:03:35.585
Were they talking to you?

1:03:36.721 --> 1:03:39.756
They don't say anything.

1:03:39.758 --> 1:03:41.424
Hmm.

1:03:41.426 --> 1:03:45.662
Well, that sounds like
schizophrenia to me. Hmm?

1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:51.468
Here we go.

1:04:06.284 --> 1:04:08.384
- Dan?
- Yeah.

1:04:08.386 --> 1:04:09.686
Fuck off.

1:04:09.688 --> 1:04:11.855
Sure.

1:04:18.163 --> 1:04:20.130
Good God.

1:04:23.568 --> 1:04:24.834
Oh!

1:04:24.836 --> 1:04:27.570
Oh!

1:04:27.572 --> 1:04:29.339
Yeah!

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:43.620
Hey!
That ain't yours.

1:04:43.622 --> 1:04:45.555
Huh?

1:04:45.557 --> 1:04:49.225
That ain't your stuff.
I know 'cause I'm watching it.

1:04:49.227 --> 1:04:53.163
Okay. But who's...
who's is it?

1:04:53.165 --> 1:04:54.831
It ain't yours!

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:56.566
Yeah, I got that.

1:04:56.568 --> 1:04:58.902
That's Lacey's.

1:04:58.904 --> 1:05:01.738
That's Lacey's space,

1:05:01.740 --> 1:05:05.642
and she's a real scary
person that Lacey.

1:05:05.644 --> 1:05:09.379
Her name is Lacey?

1:05:09.381 --> 1:05:13.917
Hey, you need some
help with that? Here.

1:05:20.625 --> 1:05:22.859
If she came back

1:05:22.861 --> 1:05:24.794
and saw you rooting
through her stuff,

1:05:24.796 --> 1:05:26.796
it wouldn't be good for you.

1:05:26.798 --> 1:05:29.899
She went in there?

1:05:29.901 --> 1:05:31.601
Oh, jeez...

1:05:33.471 --> 1:05:35.271
Yeah.

1:05:35.273 --> 1:05:37.707
She went in there earlier today
with the guy with the rings.

1:05:37.709 --> 1:05:40.276
In there?

1:05:40.278 --> 1:05:42.445
Yup.

1:05:47.719 --> 1:05:51.821
Hey! Thanks!

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:53.656
Be careful.

1:06:07.572 --> 1:06:10.540
Name.
Five seconds.

1:06:10.542 --> 1:06:12.775
Um, I'm here to see
a Paul Hoover.

1:06:12.777 --> 1:06:14.911
That's not your name.

1:06:14.913 --> 1:06:16.412
I'm Susie Rothblatt.

1:06:16.414 --> 1:06:17.914
I'm here. I'm supposed
to meet a Paul Hoover

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:20.883
and a Jerry...
I don't know his last name.

1:06:20.885 --> 1:06:22.485
Jerry... Shit.

1:06:22.487 --> 1:06:24.487
And, uh, Terrance,
Terrance Reman... Remander.

1:06:26.591 --> 1:06:28.424
Damn.

1:06:29.794 --> 1:06:32.495
I'm sorry.

1:06:32.497 --> 1:06:34.697
I thought I recognized you.

1:06:34.699 --> 1:06:36.266
Get in here.

1:06:36.268 --> 1:06:39.736
Thank you.

1:06:59.491 --> 1:07:03.293
I guess you're gonna wanna,
you know, pat me down a bit.

1:07:03.295 --> 1:07:06.496
Don't worry.
I won't make it weird for you.

1:07:06.498 --> 1:07:09.032
Sure.

1:07:14.439 --> 1:07:15.605
Keys?

1:07:15.607 --> 1:07:17.006
Yeah.

1:07:20.712 --> 1:07:23.046
Yeah, I've seen your work.

1:07:25.483 --> 1:07:29.619
Yeah. I don't know what it is.

1:07:29.621 --> 1:07:31.788
The asphyxiation stuff,
you know,

1:07:31.790 --> 1:07:35.558
just really does it for me.

1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:39.529
You're some kind of good actor
'cause it looks painful.

1:07:41.766 --> 1:07:45.968
What can I say?
I'm a pro. Right?

1:07:45.970 --> 1:07:50.606
Okay. Down the hall,
first door on the left.

1:07:51.710 --> 1:07:54.811
Thanks.

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:09.726
Reception's about
to start soon, man.

1:09:16.027 --> 1:09:18.161
Hi.

1:09:18.163 --> 1:09:20.062
Thank you for coming.

1:09:20.064 --> 1:09:21.164
Great party.

1:09:21.166 --> 1:09:23.666
Oh, hi, Tom.

1:10:29.033 --> 1:10:30.233
Enjoy yourself.

1:10:30.235 --> 1:10:31.634
- Thank you.
- See ya.

1:10:38.109 --> 1:10:40.243
She's ready
to be transported.

1:10:40.245 --> 1:10:42.678
Let the games begin.

1:10:46.684 --> 1:10:48.918
Oh, I love that.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:51.687
Ahh...

1:11:26.691 --> 1:11:30.293
Smells like bacon in there.
Fucking pig.

1:11:37.669 --> 1:11:39.735
Godfrey?

1:11:40.838 --> 1:11:42.104
What?

1:11:44.809 --> 1:11:48.044
Hey! Hey!

1:12:20.178 --> 1:12:24.113
I think we're ready
for our debut. Don't you?

1:12:39.797 --> 1:12:41.664
Godfrey?

1:12:41.666 --> 1:12:44.200
Do I know you?

1:12:44.202 --> 1:12:47.203
Fuck. Yes. Okay,
I'm a friend of Lacey's.

1:12:47.205 --> 1:12:49.171
I'm gonna need
more details than that.

1:12:49.173 --> 1:12:50.906
Okay, listen to me.

1:12:50.908 --> 1:12:53.309
Lacey is in the next room,
getting fucked up by Terrance.

1:12:53.311 --> 1:12:55.544
Who are you?

1:12:55.546 --> 1:12:57.780
I have this key thing and I
think I can get you outta here,

1:12:57.782 --> 1:12:59.015
but fuck, I can't.

1:12:59.017 --> 1:13:00.616
Yeah, Janice...

1:13:00.618 --> 1:13:02.218
You know, Janice,
the nice lady you worked with?

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:04.387
She helped me find you.

1:13:04.389 --> 1:13:06.656
Janice?
Janice from the department?

1:13:06.658 --> 1:13:08.290
Yeah. And you're also fired.

1:13:08.292 --> 1:13:10.960
Shit.

1:13:10.962 --> 1:13:13.663
Yeah, I know, but let's
just focus on living.

1:13:14.966 --> 1:13:17.033
Fuck yes! Partial freedom.

1:13:17.035 --> 1:13:19.135
Okay.

1:13:19.137 --> 1:13:20.736
We gotta get outta here.

1:13:20.738 --> 1:13:22.038
What's your name?

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:23.105
Suzzie.

1:13:23.107 --> 1:13:24.740
- I'm Godfrey.
- Okay.

1:13:36.154 --> 1:13:37.720
Wow.

1:13:37.722 --> 1:13:40.222
Bam.

1:13:52.770 --> 1:13:54.103
Dan?

1:13:54.105 --> 1:13:56.172
Yeah?

1:13:56.174 --> 1:13:58.007
Yeah.

1:14:01.279 --> 1:14:05.314
Lacey, you look
magnificent.

1:14:07.452 --> 1:14:10.052
True art takes courage.

1:14:11.489 --> 1:14:14.123
- Lacey!
- Hey!

1:14:16.127 --> 1:14:18.861
You keep an eye on her.

1:14:20.331 --> 1:14:23.432
Oh, lady, it is so
rude to interrupt people

1:14:23.434 --> 1:14:25.968
when they're working,
you know that?

1:14:45.890 --> 1:14:48.357
Terrance?

1:14:48.359 --> 1:14:50.359
Terrance?

1:14:57.935 --> 1:15:00.903
Terrance, she's squirming.

1:15:00.905 --> 1:15:02.004
Terrance?

1:15:12.884 --> 1:15:14.383
Terrance?

1:15:17.355 --> 1:15:19.355
I'll kill you!

1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:25.361
Terrance! Terrance! Terrance!
Come back, Terrance!

1:15:32.336 --> 1:15:34.904
Ahh! Terrance!
Terrance!

1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:38.040
Holy shit!
Terrance!

1:15:38.042 --> 1:15:40.810
No! I... Terrance!

1:15:47.518 --> 1:15:49.218
You've been such a loyal
customer to us,

1:15:49.220 --> 1:15:51.287
that when I bring it in,

1:15:51.289 --> 1:15:54.356
I'm gonna give you a nice spot,
right at the front.

1:16:11.309 --> 1:16:13.108
Get her!

1:16:25.923 --> 1:16:29.225
Okay. We need help.
We need help.

1:16:46.911 --> 1:16:48.010
Get away from me!

1:17:02.627 --> 1:17:05.160
Pick up.

1:17:07.498 --> 1:17:10.165
Pick up.

1:17:22.079 --> 1:17:24.046
Fuck...

1:18:08.192 --> 1:18:09.725
You smell good.

1:18:09.727 --> 1:18:11.694
I'll give you anything you want.

1:18:11.696 --> 1:18:14.463
You eat well.
No drugs, no drinking.

1:18:14.465 --> 1:18:16.231
You take care of yourself.

1:18:16.233 --> 1:18:18.701
It's a damn shame.

1:19:06.784 --> 1:19:08.717
Are you okay?

1:19:42.186 --> 1:19:44.353
We should go.

1:20:21.792 --> 1:20:24.393
I think these are mine.

1:20:28.132 --> 1:20:30.732
You following me?

1:20:30.734 --> 1:20:33.402
Could ask you the same thing.

1:20:35.239 --> 1:20:38.807
You look...

1:20:38.809 --> 1:20:41.543
Forced retirement's
been good to me.

1:20:44.582 --> 1:20:48.183
It's time for me to travel,
visit my daughter.

1:20:50.121 --> 1:20:51.887
You?

1:20:54.291 --> 1:20:58.227
What are you doing for
sustenance these days?

1:20:58.229 --> 1:21:02.331
I'm stocked
for the time being.

1:21:02.333 --> 1:21:05.234
See what a fridge
will get you?

1:21:05.236 --> 1:21:07.636
Beats snatching
people off the streets.

1:21:07.638 --> 1:21:11.473
You sure burned
through my list.

1:21:11.475 --> 1:21:13.809
Burned through my list.

1:21:13.811 --> 1:21:16.478
My heart bleeds, Godfrey.

1:21:21.352 --> 1:21:23.252
Charlie.

1:21:25.923 --> 1:21:28.223
My friends call me Charlie.

1:21:34.765 --> 1:21:36.565
Charlie...

1:21:36.567 --> 1:21:39.368
Yeah?

1:21:41.472 --> 1:21:44.640
My real name is Lilith.

1:21:48.445 --> 1:21:51.346
I'll see you around, Lilith.

1:22:30.821 --> 1:22:34.523
I don't know what
you want with me.

1:22:34.525 --> 1:22:36.992
I don't even know
if you exist.

1:22:38.262 --> 1:22:42.998
But I can't waste time
trying to guess.

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.767
It's not the endless life...

1:22:47.571 --> 1:22:49.671
...or the need to devour it...

1:22:53.844 --> 1:22:55.410
...it's what I do to life -

1:22:55.412 --> 1:22:56.445
I kill it.

1:22:56.447 --> 1:22:57.679
Ahoy there.

1:22:57.681 --> 1:22:58.914
You do all these?

1:22:58.916 --> 1:23:01.550
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

1:23:04.021 --> 1:23:05.520
Stay right where you are.

1:23:05.522 --> 1:23:07.456
Don't move.

1:23:07.458 --> 1:23:09.591
You and I need to
have a little chat.

1:23:09.593 --> 1:23:13.895
I'm made to destroy it.
That's why I can't have one of my own...

1:23:13.897 --> 1:23:15.597
Refill for your coffee?

1:23:15.599 --> 1:23:17.332
- No thanks.
- Okay.

1:23:35.519 --> 1:23:37.886
...even if I tried.

1:23:48.966 --> 1:23:51.466
The apocalypse is coming.

1:23:52.803 --> 1:23:55.470
And I need your help
to find somebody.

1:23:59.610 --> 1:24:01.843
I'm sorry for
what I did so long ago.

1:24:04.782 --> 1:24:09.051
I had a child once - a son.

1:24:12.890 --> 1:24:15.891
I'd like to miss him,

1:24:15.893 --> 1:24:18.660
but I can't picture his face.

1:24:18.662 --> 1:24:21.330
I can't.

1:24:26.503 --> 1:24:28.637
So, I'm curious -

1:24:28.639 --> 1:24:31.506
when will you be done with me?

1:24:37.481 --> 1:24:40.449
Come on...

1:24:40.451 --> 1:24:43.652
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:24:46.590 --> 1:24:47.989
Shit.

1:24:56.400 --> 1:24:58.533
Hey.

1:24:58.535 --> 1:25:00.469
No. Just...

1:25:11.081 --> 1:25:14.649
Food? Do you like food? Hey?

1:25:23.694 --> 1:25:25.494
Come on.

1:25:26.463 --> 1:25:29.131
Let's see what I have.
