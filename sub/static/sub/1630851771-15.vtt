WEBVTT

00:00.884 --> 00:03.018
- Tonight,
the my seanna crew reunite.

00:03.020 --> 00:04.920
- She wants to know
why you took the job

00:04.922 --> 00:06.789
if you were so miserable.

00:06.791 --> 00:08.357
- Go (bleep) yourself?
- I would like to say--

00:08.359 --> 00:09.858
exactly--
go (bleep) yourself.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.227
- We're busting this season
wide open.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.729
- Oh, man.

00:13.731 --> 00:16.365
- Would you bring back eddie
as first officer again?

00:16.367 --> 00:20.602
- There were such lapses
at the most inopportune times.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.337
- All we did was come
at you with love.

00:22.339 --> 00:25.040
- Love? [indistinct]
with that. I'm sorry.

00:25.042 --> 00:26.742
- Don't lie.
Man up and say what you did!

00:26.744 --> 00:28.110
You're sitting here
lying to me!

00:28.112 --> 00:29.878
- Rayna. Rayna, I'm not--
can I speak for a second

00:29.880 --> 00:30.779
now, rayna?
- No.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.981
- The below deck reunion
starts now.

00:37.021 --> 00:40.322
- Welcome to the
below deck season 9 reunion.

00:40.324 --> 00:42.291
I'm andy cohen,
ready to mix it up

00:42.293 --> 00:43.525
with the my seanna crew,

00:43.527 --> 00:45.294
like they're
a chicken curry platter

00:45.296 --> 00:47.463
that someone stuck
in a blender.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.299
So without further ado,
let's welcome the yachties.

00:50.301 --> 00:53.635
First up, it's the stud of
the sea, captain lee rosbach.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.070
Hey, captain lee.

00:55.072 --> 00:56.438
- Good evening, andy.
How you doin'?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.440
- Great!
And, he rocks it on deck

00:58.442 --> 01:01.577
almost as hard as he rocks
an alexander hamilton wig--

01:01.579 --> 01:03.946
- it's alexander hamilton!

01:03.948 --> 01:05.748
- Say hi to first officer
eddie lucas.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.383
Hey, eddie.
- Hey, andy. How you doin'?

01:08.385 --> 01:10.052
- Good to see you.
Up next,

01:10.054 --> 01:13.322
she ran a tight ship
without taking any lip,

01:13.324 --> 01:14.990
it's chief stew,
heather chase.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.093
Hey, heather!
- Hi, andy!

01:18.095 --> 01:19.995
- Nice to see you.
And speaking of,

01:19.997 --> 01:21.797
she's got a mouth
like a sailor,

01:21.799 --> 01:23.966
so I guess she's in
the right line of work.

01:23.968 --> 01:26.969
It is the fabulous chef
rachel hargrove.

01:26.971 --> 01:29.071
Hi, rachel!
- Hi, andy.

01:29.073 --> 01:31.640
Hi, everyone.
- Please welcome two-thirds

01:31.642 --> 01:35.310
of the most infamous throuple
to hit the high seas.

01:35.312 --> 01:38.714
Deckhand rayna lindsey.
Hi, rayna!

01:38.716 --> 01:40.048
- Hi, andy.
How are you?

01:40.050 --> 01:42.050
- Great!
And, second stew,

01:42.052 --> 01:44.686
fraser olender.
Hey, fraser.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.888
- Hi, andy.
How are you?

01:45.890 --> 01:47.790
- Great to see you.
And finally,

01:47.792 --> 01:49.324
I'm hoping their wifi
connection today

01:49.326 --> 01:52.694
is more successful than their
love connection onboard.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.130
Give it up for deckhand
wes o'dell.

01:55.132 --> 01:56.298
Hi, wes!
- Hey!

01:56.300 --> 01:58.767
- And third stew
jessica albert.

01:58.769 --> 02:00.369
Hi, jessica!

02:00.371 --> 02:02.204
- Hi, andy!

02:02.206 --> 02:03.672
- A little bit later,
we're gonna be joined

02:03.674 --> 02:06.975
by kaylee, and jake
was unfortunately

02:06.977 --> 02:09.344
not able
to join us today,

02:09.346 --> 02:11.480
which I am personally
very sad about.

02:11.482 --> 02:12.781
Um, fraser,

02:12.783 --> 02:15.851
did you know how much
you talked to yourself,

02:15.853 --> 02:18.387
you know, just muttered
to yourself

02:18.389 --> 02:21.023
before seeing yourself
on the show?

02:21.025 --> 02:23.292
- Nobody wants me
to get sour, trust me.

02:27.531 --> 02:30.365
- It's been quite
an eye-opening year for me.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.934
I didn't know I did half
the things I do,

02:31.936 --> 02:34.436
but to watch it back
is haunting, worrying,

02:34.438 --> 02:36.672
but equally, uh,
sometimes quite funny.

02:36.674 --> 02:39.408
So, I'm not too embarrassed.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.010
- Rayna, were you aware
that you were an eye roller

02:42.012 --> 02:44.046
before the show haened?

02:44.048 --> 02:46.048
- Most definitely.
100 percent.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.749
I mean, I used to get
grounded growing up

02:47.751 --> 02:50.586
for eye rolling, so--
- is that true?

02:50.588 --> 02:52.754
- All the time!
Like, my dad used to be like,

02:52.756 --> 02:54.389
I'm gonna pop those eyes
outta your head.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.158
So, like, all the time.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.061
Something I've always done.
It's terrible.

02:59.063 --> 03:00.362
Um, I'm trying though.
I'm trying.

03:00.364 --> 03:03.165
- That's funny.
That is funny.

03:03.167 --> 03:06.034
Uh, well this season,
the crew wasted no time

03:06.036 --> 03:09.071
turning my seanna
into a love boat.

03:09.073 --> 03:13.275
Including below deck's first
guy-on-guy makeout sessions.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.178
I wanna re-visit
the hot and heavy moments

03:16.180 --> 03:18.380
between the yachties.

03:18.382 --> 03:20.249
Just tell us who you'd like
to make out with

03:20.251 --> 03:22.484
at the table.

03:22.486 --> 03:24.486
Jess, jess, jess, jess!

03:24.488 --> 03:26.822
[cheering]

03:30.027 --> 03:33.378
- I was [indistinct]
at you.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.163
- Oh, my god, three-way.

03:35.165 --> 03:37.599
[exclaiming]

03:37.601 --> 03:41.603
[overlapped chatter]

03:41.605 --> 03:42.988
- jake is very attractive

03:42.990 --> 03:44.839
and I might have
a little crush.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.441
- If you guys hook-up,
can I watch, please?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.911
- Hey, bitches.
- Yeah!

03:48.913 --> 03:51.146
- Love you.
Muah!

03:58.038 --> 04:00.188
- Excuse me?
- Jake is a ----in' pig,

04:00.190 --> 04:01.890
who is now ----ing rayna.

04:03.827 --> 04:08.964
- How much of norbit
did you guys wind up watching?

04:08.966 --> 04:11.266
- Fraser?
- Too much.

04:11.268 --> 04:12.401
Far too much.

04:12.403 --> 04:15.337
- Too much?
That's what you said?

04:15.339 --> 04:18.040
- Yeah, no.
Um, I didn't watch much of it.

04:18.042 --> 04:19.374
You guys
were really into it.

04:19.376 --> 04:21.076
But I needed to get out
and I did,

04:21.078 --> 04:23.578
and I--
and I made a good call.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.347
- At least he didn't say
not enough.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.616
- I know, exactly.
- Right.

04:27.618 --> 04:31.320
- Fraser, why-why did you feel
like you needed to get out?

04:31.322 --> 04:33.322
- There were things going on,
on both sides of me.

04:33.324 --> 04:35.724
- Yes.
- And, um, you know,

04:35.726 --> 04:37.292
it was wonderful.
It was a lovely little cuddle,

04:37.294 --> 04:39.394
but, you know, everything's
got its expiring date.

04:39.396 --> 04:41.063
And it expired for me.

04:41.065 --> 04:43.332
- Uh, rayna,
angela s. Said,

04:43.334 --> 04:45.334
"why did you talk about
how bad you were being treated

04:45.336 --> 04:47.502
by your boss, jake,
but ultimately ended up

04:47.504 --> 04:49.905
almost sleeping
with him still

04:49.907 --> 04:53.942
after finding out
he was engaged."

04:53.944 --> 04:57.479
- well, jake's not engaged.
It was for a green card.

04:57.481 --> 04:59.014
- Right.
- Let's be--

04:59.016 --> 05:00.749
let's be clear on that.
- Yes.

05:00.751 --> 05:02.417
- And I even talked to her
on the phone

05:02.419 --> 05:04.052
on the boat as well.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.687
That was very clear.

05:05.689 --> 05:09.391
And, I think me and jake
are great outside of working,

05:09.393 --> 05:13.595
but on-- working together
just doesn't really work.

05:13.597 --> 05:14.730
- By the way,

05:14.732 --> 05:17.733
I can't imagine that
that green card marriage

05:17.735 --> 05:20.402
is gonna work after
proclaiming on television

05:20.404 --> 05:22.704
that it is
a green card marriage.

05:22.706 --> 05:24.740
- She's not my girlfriend.
She's my mate.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.808
She needs
a british passport.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.777
- Ah!

05:28.779 --> 05:30.912
- I was pretty surprised
when he openly admitted that

05:30.914 --> 05:32.114
on television.

05:32.116 --> 05:33.448
I was like, well there goes
the green card.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.283
- Right.
- I was like...

05:35.285 --> 05:38.653
- Eddie, is there any news
about you and your girlfriend?

05:38.655 --> 05:40.856
She got her
green card, right?

05:40.858 --> 05:43.058
- Yeah, well she got it
while she was living
up in new york.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.459
You know, of her
being from brazil,

05:44.461 --> 05:46.995
and, uh, and-
and half japanese,

05:46.997 --> 05:48.730
you know, she had to get-
get a, uh,

05:48.732 --> 05:50.432
her citizenship actually.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.101
And, uh, things are
goin' really well.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.569
- Wow.

05:54.571 --> 05:57.239
Um, fraser, stephanie
from seattle said,

05:57.241 --> 05:59.641
"looking back at
the airing of the show,

05:59.643 --> 06:03.045
"do you regret your sexually
charged interactions with jake

06:03.047 --> 06:06.081
"or would you do it all over
again, given the chance?"

06:06.083 --> 06:08.316
- I'd do it all over again.
We had an amazing season.

06:08.318 --> 06:09.785
And jake and I
are friends

06:09.787 --> 06:11.620
as I've specified
on so many occasions,

06:11.622 --> 06:13.055
but no, it's all
fun and games.

06:13.057 --> 06:14.322
I don't regret anything.

06:14.324 --> 06:16.191
- We got a lot of viewer
questions wanting to know

06:16.193 --> 06:20.962
fraser if the two of you
ever did wind up hooking up.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.697
- Oh, that's good.

06:22.699 --> 06:25.801
- Okay, um...

06:25.803 --> 06:28.236
- Just gonna skirt around
that question.

06:28.238 --> 06:30.639
- Jess, brandon l. Thinks
you and wes would make

06:30.641 --> 06:32.541
such a cute couple.

06:32.543 --> 06:34.709
Was he the person you were
first attracted to

06:34.711 --> 06:36.845
when you initially
joined the boat?

06:36.847 --> 06:38.680
- I mean, I think that
it was all-in-all

06:38.682 --> 06:39.915
a pretty attractive crew.

06:39.917 --> 06:42.918
But yes, I did find
wes attractive.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.053
- Wes, do you regret not
going in for the kiss

06:45.055 --> 06:49.291
with jess this season
when you had the chance?

06:49.293 --> 06:51.393
- Um, yeah.

06:51.395 --> 06:53.462
Um, I just wanted to
make sure that was something

06:53.464 --> 06:55.597
that she wanted to do
as well.

06:55.599 --> 06:57.232
- Well done.

06:57.234 --> 06:59.601
Okay, I wanna move on.
Well this season,

06:59.603 --> 07:01.470
heather ran the
interior department

07:01.472 --> 07:03.271
with an iron fist,

07:03.273 --> 07:05.273
but that didn't stop
all the stews

07:05.275 --> 07:07.943
from running their mouths
about each other.

07:07.945 --> 07:08.994
Take a look.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.412
[sighing]

07:10.414 --> 07:12.681
- I'm running on nothing.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.816
- Fraser, can I get
some backup on service?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.736
- Heather needs
to place some order

07:17.738 --> 07:19.538
into this chaotic mess.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.257
- Hi! How's it goin'?
- Well, not so well.

07:22.259 --> 07:23.925
I still have
the trash bags.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.360
- I'm so sorry.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.913
This is such
a rookie mistake.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.916
- I wanted to discuss
about jess for a bit.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.467
She's just, like,
moping around,

07:32.469 --> 07:34.169
and just like,
she's pure misery.

07:34.171 --> 07:36.404
- There's, like,
all eyes on you right now.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.573
And training day
is, like, over with.

07:38.575 --> 07:41.109
It's coming to the point
of like, the last straw.

07:41.111 --> 07:42.677
I just really need jess
to understand that

07:42.679 --> 07:44.546
there's no room for
errors anymore.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.681
We need to show up
or ship out.

07:46.683 --> 07:47.849
- I'm really sorry,

07:47.851 --> 07:51.253
and I hate to put you guys
in a bad place.

07:51.255 --> 07:53.472
I have to go.
I need to leave.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.690
Obviously, I'm leaving them
pretty high and dry,

07:55.692 --> 07:58.193
I get it, but at
the end of the day,

07:58.195 --> 07:59.327
I come first.

07:59.329 --> 08:02.464
- We're, um, getting my stew
for my boat in florida.

08:02.466 --> 08:03.698
- I feel threatened.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.168
I just worry that it's just
gonna disrupt the balance.

08:06.170 --> 08:07.435
- That's ----ing bullsh--.

08:07.437 --> 08:08.403
- Nice to meet you.
How are you doing?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.604
- Nice to meet you.
I'm kaylee.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.473
- Can I see you, kaylee?
Sorry, I'm very sweaty.

08:11.475 --> 08:15.393
She can stay very much
in the laundry and cabins.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.812
I'll be behind
the bar, kaylee.

08:17.814 --> 08:20.782
We are now being joined
by third stew, kaylee milligan.

08:20.784 --> 08:23.919
Welcome, kaylee!
- Hey, andy!

08:23.921 --> 08:25.987
- Thanks for joining us.
- Hey, everyone.

08:25.989 --> 08:27.889
Thanks for having me.
- Hi, kaylee.

08:27.891 --> 08:31.059
- Um, lee, daryl t., uh,
wants to know if you think

08:31.061 --> 08:32.928
the guest critiques
of the housekeeping

08:32.930 --> 08:34.496
in the beginning
of the season

08:34.498 --> 08:36.798
was an indicator that
the interior team

08:36.800 --> 08:39.334
wasn't up to par,
or were they just

08:39.336 --> 08:41.436
getting used to
working together?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.738
I think it was moreso
the fact of them

08:43.740 --> 08:46.308
getting used to
working together,

08:46.310 --> 08:49.844
as opposed to their ability
to get the job done.

08:49.846 --> 08:52.247
I think everybody
that was onboard was--

08:52.249 --> 08:54.616
was very,
very qualified.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.986
- Marilyn m., uh, has
a question for you, jess.

08:57.988 --> 09:00.021
She wants to know
why you took the job

09:00.023 --> 09:01.790
if you were so miserable.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.125
She said you were
miserable from the start.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.062
Why even bother?
- Go (bleep) yourself.

09:07.064 --> 09:09.130
- What I would like to say is--
- seriously.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.367
- Exactly, go (bleep) yourself.
- Seriously, karen, bye!

09:12.369 --> 09:14.336
No one has time
for karens.

09:14.338 --> 09:16.571
[laughing]
- no, but honestly,

09:16.573 --> 09:18.773
none of us-- well,
I would say most of us

09:18.775 --> 09:21.876
did not know what we were
getting ourselves into.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.446
I come from a private
yachting world

09:24.448 --> 09:27.349
where I'm a sole stewardess
on a yacht, by myself.

09:27.351 --> 09:30.352
And so, quite frankly,
the whole production experience

09:30.354 --> 09:32.287
of this really
hindered my ability

09:32.289 --> 09:34.356
to do my job
successfully.

09:34.358 --> 09:36.358
My anxiety was
through the roof

09:36.360 --> 09:39.327
with cameras
being on us 24/7.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.363
It was just too much
for me to handle,

09:41.365 --> 09:44.266
my body to handle,
and I just wasn't reacting well

09:44.268 --> 09:46.401
in the--
in the situation.

09:46.403 --> 09:48.903
- Heather,
how was it for you?

09:48.905 --> 09:52.107
- The first few days when
the cameras were around you,

09:52.109 --> 09:53.675
it was difficult,
but after that,

09:53.677 --> 09:55.043
it was like, you know,
you're just dancing

09:55.045 --> 09:57.612
around them, and they kinda just
disappeared into the background.

09:57.614 --> 10:00.548
So it was pretty easy.
- Jess, leslie o. Said

10:00.550 --> 10:02.584
after watching the show back,
how did you feel about

10:02.586 --> 10:04.853
heather saying she wanted
to put pressure on you

10:04.855 --> 10:06.655
by putting you
on service?

10:06.657 --> 10:08.923
Do you think she was
trying to break you?

10:08.925 --> 10:10.542
- I'm gonna put a little
pressure on jess.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.926
- Okay.
- And I'd love to put her

10:11.928 --> 10:14.662
on service and you on laundry.
- Okay.

10:14.664 --> 10:16.014
- I wanna see if
a little excitement

10:16.016 --> 10:17.265
might bring her out
of her shell.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.800
- Yeah, that's not
a bad thought, actually.

10:18.802 --> 10:20.702
- I don't think that
you try and put pressure

10:20.704 --> 10:23.638
on someone when you know that
they're under a lot of stress.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.508
I think that you try
and help them eliminate that,

10:26.510 --> 10:28.677
so I think that she was
obviously setting me up

10:28.679 --> 10:30.278
for failure, but...

10:30.280 --> 10:33.081
To each their own,
I really couldn't care less.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.750
- Do you really think
that that's true, jess?

10:35.752 --> 10:36.818
- Coming up...

10:36.820 --> 10:38.553
- All we did was
come at you with love.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.754
- There was no love,

10:39.756 --> 10:42.490
so back the (bleep) up
with that. I'm sorry.

10:42.492 --> 10:43.758
No.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.627
♪♪

10:48.164 --> 10:50.365
- I think she was obviously
setting me up for failure.

10:50.367 --> 10:54.135
But, to each their own.
I really couldn't care less.

10:54.137 --> 10:56.471
- Do you really think
that that's true, jess?

10:56.473 --> 10:58.306
- No way.
I couldn't--

10:58.308 --> 10:59.874
- you said--
- there's no way that's true.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.710
- I wanna put pressure--
- I sat there and asked you--

11:01.712 --> 11:04.646
- you wanna put pressure
on jess. Your words.

11:04.648 --> 11:06.147
- Yeah, I said that to fraser.
- It's your words,

11:06.149 --> 11:07.849
and you can't take them back.
- But what about the words

11:07.851 --> 11:09.651
that y and I had
when you said,

11:09.653 --> 11:11.453
"yeah, getting out
of laundry might be nice,

11:11.455 --> 11:12.987
"and I really wanna
go to the beach."

11:12.989 --> 11:15.724
and, you know what?
You can sit here and say

11:15.726 --> 11:18.426
you came as a solo stew
from a boat like that,

11:18.428 --> 11:19.461
but you've seen the show.

11:19.463 --> 11:21.663
You know this isn't
a solo stew gig.

11:21.665 --> 11:24.165
You know a lot was
gonna be asked of you.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.601
And you said you were
depressed in the laundry,

11:26.603 --> 11:28.570
so I said, "do you wanna
change of scenery?"

11:28.572 --> 11:31.172
and you volunteered
yourself to be on surface.

11:31.174 --> 11:33.241
My confidential
conversation with fraser

11:33.243 --> 11:35.543
about putting pressure
on you was in a way that

11:35.545 --> 11:38.513
we were tired of picking up
after you so much that it was

11:38.515 --> 11:42.083
time that he felt reassured
that I was doing something,

11:42.085 --> 11:45.420
and that we weren't gonna have
to keep doing your job for you.

11:45.422 --> 11:47.856
- What good would it be
for heather to set her own team

11:47.858 --> 11:50.892
up for failure? I mean,
for me, that's just absurd.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.394
And it wasn't
the case at all.

11:52.396 --> 11:53.428
We wanted to
change things up.

11:53.430 --> 11:55.563
We wanted to
get jess' mood up,

11:55.565 --> 11:58.166
and-and-- this was
heather's idea.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.234
I had nothing
to do with it.

11:59.236 --> 12:00.835
So there was no
conspiring there.

12:00.837 --> 12:02.036
There was no teaming.

12:02.038 --> 12:03.338
- There was a lot
of conversation

12:03.340 --> 12:05.106
between heather and fraser
behind my back

12:05.108 --> 12:09.277
that I was privy to, and to
be dancing around a boat

12:09.279 --> 12:11.446
knowing that these
conversations are taking place,

12:11.448 --> 12:13.982
and then having heather
only have conversations

12:13.984 --> 12:16.651
with me when a--
when a camera was present,

12:16.653 --> 12:18.420
was just-- it-it--
everything--

12:18.422 --> 12:21.189
- there's cameras
present 24/7!

12:21.191 --> 12:23.792
That is so false.
I asked you so many times

12:23.794 --> 12:25.160
to your face how I could
be a better leader.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.961
- What did I say about you?
- What I could do better

12:26.963 --> 12:28.897
for you. And you would
sit there and say

12:28.899 --> 12:31.633
"I'm fine, I'm fine." and--
- you would, yeah.

12:31.635 --> 12:33.168
- You never would tell me
to my face how I could be

12:33.170 --> 12:34.769
a better leader.
- We didn't know

12:34.771 --> 12:36.237
how you were feeling, ever.
- So please, I beg of you,

12:36.239 --> 12:38.506
do not sit here and act
like we did not try.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.175
There was no bullying you.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.010
All we did was
come at you with love,

12:42.012 --> 12:45.246
and you just kept pretending
like nothing was wrong

12:45.248 --> 12:46.714
to my face, which seems--
- love? Heather, love?

12:46.716 --> 12:47.816
- To be a common--
- heather, you didn't

12:47.818 --> 12:50.285
talk to me, ever.
So there was no love.

12:50.287 --> 12:53.154
So back the (bleep) up
with that, I'm sorry.

12:53.156 --> 12:54.889
No.
- Jess, sara d. Wants to know

12:54.891 --> 12:56.925
if there was anything heather
could've done differently

12:56.927 --> 12:58.293
to make you finish
out the season,

12:58.295 --> 13:00.528
or were you just
so over it?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.564
- I really wanted
to finish this out,

13:02.566 --> 13:05.733
however, I had lost 15 pounds
from the moment that

13:05.735 --> 13:08.403
I had stepped onboard.
- Wow.

13:08.405 --> 13:12.574
- I was not about to
let what that does to somebody

13:12.576 --> 13:15.877
emotionally and mentally
play out on camera.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.879
- Mmm.
- I needed to leave,

13:17.881 --> 13:20.181
for my own peace of mind.
And I'm sorry that that

13:20.183 --> 13:23.751
put everyone in a predicament,
but that was where I was at.

13:23.753 --> 13:25.820
- I would like
to say that...

13:25.822 --> 13:29.157
After all of this season
has happened, and I've dealt

13:29.159 --> 13:32.994
with those repercussions
of the anxiety since filming

13:32.996 --> 13:35.697
in a different way,
and I'm sorry I couldn't

13:35.699 --> 13:38.233
support you better.
I'm sorry with all the drama

13:38.235 --> 13:40.235
that did go down.
I learned a lot

13:40.237 --> 13:42.303
looking back at
this season, and...

13:42.305 --> 13:44.038
I just felt I owed you
an apology, and I wish you

13:44.040 --> 13:45.840
nothing but the best.

13:45.842 --> 13:46.975
- Thank you,
and I appreciate that.

13:46.977 --> 13:48.476
And I'm sorry that
I wasn't more open

13:48.478 --> 13:50.845
with how I was feeling
with my anxiety, but--

13:50.847 --> 13:52.881
again, that was something
that I was trying to ignore

13:52.883 --> 13:56.084
because I didn't
want it to be a topic.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.353
I'm sorry that I couldn't
finish it out with everyone.

13:58.355 --> 14:00.188
- What are you
doing now, jess?

14:00.190 --> 14:02.323
- So I work in sales
and catering

14:02.325 --> 14:05.426
for a historic resort
in southwest florida,

14:05.428 --> 14:06.961
a very beautiful
beach resort,

14:06.963 --> 14:08.696
and I'm very happy
doing it.

14:08.698 --> 14:11.499
- Cool. Congratulations.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

14:11.501 --> 14:13.635
- Um, kaylee, shawn t.
Wants to know

14:13.637 --> 14:14.903
what the mood was like

14:14.905 --> 14:18.373
when you joined the cruise
so late in the charter season.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.409
Watching it back, did-did
seeing fraser's reaction

14:21.411 --> 14:23.444
to when he learned
you were joining the crew

14:23.446 --> 14:25.313
come as a shock?

14:25.315 --> 14:27.282
- I mean, you know what?
It did initially,

14:27.284 --> 14:30.485
but he apologized.
He came to me.

14:30.487 --> 14:32.720
He apologized
for the things that he said

14:32.722 --> 14:36.824
and the insecurity that he was
feeling before I came on.

14:36.826 --> 14:39.561
- Um, ronnie f. Wants to know
why it was such a big deal

14:39.563 --> 14:41.129
for heather to bring
on her friend

14:41.131 --> 14:43.131
on the deck team, fraser.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.568
Don't you want more help
on the team?

14:46.570 --> 14:48.903
- Oh, of course. I never
doubted needing help.

14:48.905 --> 14:51.706
I just felt a little bit--
not-not betrayed,

14:51.708 --> 14:53.341
but I just didn't feel
like I was in the loop,

14:53.343 --> 14:55.209
and with a team of two,
my lord,

14:55.211 --> 14:56.911
does there need to be
full communication.

14:56.913 --> 14:58.746
And-- but, you know--
- oh, my gosh, yeah, fraser.

14:58.748 --> 15:00.014
- Everything turned out.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.383
- Yeah, I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

15:02.385 --> 15:05.286
- Jess and kaylee, um,
kevin h. Said,

15:05.288 --> 15:07.922
"on 'watch what happens live,'
fraser said heather's tone

15:07.924 --> 15:09.757
"was cold and blunt,

15:09.759 --> 15:12.260
"and never delivered orders
in a nice way.

15:12.262 --> 15:14.963
"do you guys agree?"
jess?

15:14.965 --> 15:18.933
- You know, I think heather is
a fantastic chief stewardess,

15:18.935 --> 15:22.036
and I think that sometimes,
personalities just clash.

15:22.038 --> 15:23.738
- Kaylee?
- I think, you know,

15:23.740 --> 15:25.073
when you're in the middle
of a charter season,

15:25.075 --> 15:26.341
you gotta get stuff done,

15:26.343 --> 15:28.476
so if it comes off
a little bitchy,

15:28.478 --> 15:30.745
I don't know,
you just gotta do it.

15:30.747 --> 15:32.313
- I mean, I'll be
the first to admit,

15:32.315 --> 15:34.349
sometimes my delivery
is not like,

15:34.351 --> 15:36.551
"oh, my god, let's go do
beds and heads.

15:36.553 --> 15:38.553
"if you could really cut those
lines in a circle,

15:38.555 --> 15:39.821
"that'd be great!"

15:39.823 --> 15:42.023
but that's why I don't
teach kindergarten,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.091
and I do know

15:43.093 --> 15:46.861
that I'm definitely
not a cheerleader 24/7.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.163
- All right, well, we are
gonna leave it there,

15:49.165 --> 15:51.299
uh, and, kaylee, we're gonna
say goodbye to you.

15:51.301 --> 15:54.535
Thanks for joining us.
- Thanks for having me, guys.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.903
Coming up, chef rachel's
in the hot seat.

15:55.905 --> 15:56.838
We're gonna be right back

15:56.840 --> 15:58.740
with more of the
"below deck" reunion.

15:58.742 --> 16:01.342
Lee, who do you think
is-is truly to blame

16:01.344 --> 16:04.512
for the problems the deck crew
experienced this season?

16:12.421 --> 16:14.689
We are back with
the "below deck" reunion.

16:14.691 --> 16:18.059
During the break, we actually
had a really nice moment.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.694
Rayna, you just revealed,

16:19.696 --> 16:22.330
if you're comfortable
saying it...

16:22.332 --> 16:23.431
- Yeah, well, definitely.

16:23.433 --> 16:26.601
I am two months sober
of alcohol.

16:26.603 --> 16:28.703
God is so good.
I am loving it.

16:28.705 --> 16:31.139
I'm super happy.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:31.141 --> 16:33.207
- And eddie,
you asked her...

16:33.209 --> 16:35.309
- I-I asked, uh, you know,
if there was something

16:35.311 --> 16:37.412
that-that caused it, you know,
if there was a reason,

16:37.414 --> 16:38.946
because while we
were working together,

16:38.948 --> 16:41.649
I never saw an issue
with her drinking.

16:41.651 --> 16:43.718
And so I was just curious, uh,
of what--

16:43.720 --> 16:45.353
what made the change.

16:45.355 --> 16:47.722
- I just-- I have a lot
of childhood trauma,

16:47.724 --> 16:50.558
and, like, issues that
I just want to deal with,

16:50.560 --> 16:52.960
and I'm tried of, like,
running from, like,

16:52.962 --> 16:54.729
you know, having
depressive episodes,

16:54.731 --> 16:58.299
or feeling, um,
just not 100%.

16:58.301 --> 17:00.201
Uh, so I'm taking
the plunge

17:00.203 --> 17:03.705
to make sure that
I am 100%, so yeah.

17:03.707 --> 17:05.440
- Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

17:05.442 --> 17:09.143
- And did you say rachel had
some influence over that, rayna?

17:09.145 --> 17:11.212
- She had
a huge influence.

17:11.214 --> 17:14.882
Um, we were in the hotel
after we got done filming.

17:14.884 --> 17:17.552
She told me, like,
you know, this is the time

17:17.554 --> 17:19.587
where you need to face
your demons.

17:19.589 --> 17:21.322
U need to fight
those battles.

17:21.324 --> 17:22.557
You need to
stop running.

17:22.559 --> 17:24.425
You know, like, this is the time
that you need to do it.

17:24.427 --> 17:27.462
And that conversation
has stuck with me ever since.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.363
Rachel, you know
I love you so much,

17:29.365 --> 17:31.132
and I appreciate you

17:31.134 --> 17:34.368
and everything that you've
helped me out with, so yeah.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.304
- That's so nice.
- Thank you.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.371
- Well, late season,

17:37.373 --> 17:39.707
it seemed like rachel
was either overserved

17:39.709 --> 17:43.177
or grumbling about stews
who under-communicate,

17:43.179 --> 17:44.612
but for the most part,

17:44.614 --> 17:48.082
her job performance this year
was perfectly well done.

17:48.084 --> 17:49.484
Take a look.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.586
- Bitch face focused.
Comin' in hot.

17:51.588 --> 17:53.821
There's ----ing hair in here.
Oh, no, it's mint.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.258
- Chelsea will be coming aboard
with her jaw wired shut.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.311
- We tried, like, whatever
we're eating to liquefy it

18:00.313 --> 18:01.596
and see how it goes

18:01.598 --> 18:03.581
so she can enjoy
the same stuff we're having.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.732
- Like, what the (bleep)?

18:04.734 --> 18:08.136
We need to get chelsea food,
like, right now.

18:08.138 --> 18:10.437
(bleep)
what the (bleep)?

18:10.439 --> 18:12.273
- She's allergic
to shell fish,

18:12.275 --> 18:13.724
and then pete
doesn't like cheese.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.828
- I'm about to lose my sh--.
- How's it tasting?

18:16.830 --> 18:19.113
- I mean, I have put
on my preference sheet

18:19.115 --> 18:20.331
a million times,

18:20.333 --> 18:22.450
no cooked fish--
shell fish.

18:22.452 --> 18:24.318
- [indistinct] from something
that's happened prior,

18:24.320 --> 18:26.821
and it's just compiled
into, you know,...

18:29.425 --> 18:33.694
- Lee, um, chef rachel had
an amazing season this season.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.365
Um, can you say, out of all
of the staff that you've had,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.634
that she has redeemed
herself the most

18:39.636 --> 18:42.003
from kind of the way
that you started

18:42.005 --> 18:46.107
to how she's, uh,
how she's progressed?

18:46.109 --> 18:49.177
- Yeah, we-we definitely
had a couple of speed bumps,

18:49.179 --> 18:50.812
to say the least,

18:50.814 --> 18:54.248
but, uh, the way
she came back this year

18:54.250 --> 18:57.351
was just truly,
truly remarkable,

18:57.353 --> 18:59.520
and I-I'm still amazed

18:59.522 --> 19:03.558
at her command
of her craft.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.293
- Thank you, captain.
- Nice.

19:05.295 --> 19:07.995
Um, rachel, how do you
explain cooking lobster

19:07.997 --> 19:12.466
for the guest that
didn't want cooked fish?

19:12.468 --> 19:15.036
- I don't do raw lobster.
[laughter]

19:15.038 --> 19:18.606
- raw lobster?
- Does anybody?

19:18.608 --> 19:22.543
- But, I mean, what about
just not making fish?

19:22.545 --> 19:24.579
- Well, I mean, shellfish
and fish, to me,

19:24.581 --> 19:26.247
is completely different,
you know?

19:26.249 --> 19:27.381
- Right. Right.
- Right?

19:27.383 --> 19:30.852
- Sorry. I mean, it is
different, you know?

19:30.854 --> 19:33.221
I've never met anybody
who's been like, hey.

19:33.223 --> 19:35.389
It's not the same thing
to me, you know?

19:35.391 --> 19:36.724
But, I mean, whatever.

19:36.726 --> 19:39.393
We-we rebounded from it,
you know? I mean--

19:39.395 --> 19:40.528
it's all good.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.331
- Listen, speaking
of rebounding,

19:43.333 --> 19:47.068
seeing the guest
with her jaw wired shut

19:47.070 --> 19:49.070
was a wild ride.

19:49.072 --> 19:51.138
What do you think
was the weirdest thing

19:51.140 --> 19:54.942
that you served
her pureed?

19:54.944 --> 19:56.844
- Ooh, that's a good question.
- Oh, man.

19:56.846 --> 20:00.982
Um, it's blended oysters.

20:00.984 --> 20:04.819
- Blend-- it was oysters?
Pureed oysters?

20:04.821 --> 20:06.954
- Oh, my god, it was so bad.
- Just all of it.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.290
I just can't do it.
I guess it was just like--

20:09.292 --> 20:12.426
I just thought to myself, like,
I've had problems

20:12.428 --> 20:14.328
where I've had to
hock up stuff before

20:14.330 --> 20:15.463
and hold it in my mouth,

20:15.465 --> 20:17.164
but that was
the equivalent of it.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.966
[laughing]

20:18.968 --> 20:22.136
- um, I'm-I'm wondering
if the crew thinks--

20:22.138 --> 20:23.604
do you agree
with captain lee

20:23.606 --> 20:27.541
that rachel is the best yacht
chef that you've worked with?

20:27.543 --> 20:30.177
Fraser's nodding,
rayna, eddie, wes.

20:30.179 --> 20:34.315
Wow, you're all-- wow!
- She's insane.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.616
She's incredible.
- The things that

20:35.618 --> 20:36.951
that woman pulls...
- She's a ----ing queen.

20:36.953 --> 20:40.187
- ...In the middle of a service,
like, even all her tasting menus

20:40.189 --> 20:41.989
were out of this world,

20:41.991 --> 20:44.859
and I just sat in amazement at
what she could put together

20:44.861 --> 20:46.861
in such a short
amount of time.

20:46.863 --> 20:49.497
You know, I've known chefs who
need hours to prep for that,

20:49.499 --> 20:51.732
and rachel just pulls it
out of the air,

20:51.734 --> 20:54.568
and it's the most incredible
experience to watch her,

20:54.570 --> 20:55.603
and on top of that,

20:55.605 --> 20:58.306
she was feeding us
incredible food, too.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.209
- So, rachel, did you end up
buying that bus

21:02.211 --> 21:05.546
and touring around
the country?

21:05.548 --> 21:08.082
- I did buy the bus.
I did.

21:08.084 --> 21:10.751
It's a 40-foot thomas
with a cummins engine

21:10.753 --> 21:12.019
and allison transmission

21:12.021 --> 21:14.755
with only 89,000
miles on it, baby.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.892
- Oh, hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah.

21:17.894 --> 21:20.394
- Wow.
Coming up--

21:20.396 --> 21:23.597
would you bring back eddie
as first officer again?

21:23.599 --> 21:26.100
There were such lapses.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.742
- Welcome back.
I'm andy cohen,

21:34.744 --> 21:37.445
reuniting with the "my seanna"
crew from "below deck."

21:37.447 --> 21:39.680
well, despite eddie's
best efforts

21:39.682 --> 21:41.549
to keep the deck
crew in line,

21:41.551 --> 21:43.117
his crew was plagued

21:43.119 --> 21:46.087
by constant eff ups
this season.

21:46.089 --> 21:47.221
I want to take
a look back

21:47.223 --> 21:50.958
at "my seanna's" deckhand
dysfunction. Watch.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.094
- What was that? (bleep)
- oh, hell, no.

21:53.096 --> 21:55.863
- Cushions! Cushions! Cushions!
- John? John? John?

21:55.865 --> 21:57.798
Wes? Hey, we lost
a couple cushions

21:57.800 --> 21:59.433
as we just left anchorage.

21:59.435 --> 22:01.002
- Oh, you lost a big one.
- Don't tell me

22:01.004 --> 22:03.604
I'm gonna have to go back
and get ----ing cushions.

22:03.606 --> 22:06.607
That's gonna upset me.
- I'm really ----ing serious.

22:06.609 --> 22:08.876
No more (bleep) ups.
Hey, wes!

22:08.878 --> 22:10.378
You need to attach it
to your stern

22:10.380 --> 22:13.147
so you get more
----ing pull.

22:13.149 --> 22:16.233
- He is not gettin' it.
- God damn it.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.536
- The bar is up here.
You guys are down here.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.753
Way down here.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.206
This is your final wake-up call.
- Is something wrong?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.824
- No, I haven't
said anything.

22:23.826 --> 22:24.909
- No, you don't have
to say anything.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.360
Your eyes were rolling
to the back of your head.

22:26.362 --> 22:27.528
- I've been working
my ass off all day.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.630
I'm just over it.
- Everybody on the deck team,

22:29.632 --> 22:31.332
including jake,
needs to step it up.

22:31.334 --> 22:34.568
Otherwise, captain lee is
going to rip our soul out

22:34.570 --> 22:36.270
through our butts.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.873
- So, rayna, what were your
first impressions of eddie

22:38.875 --> 22:41.542
as a-- as a first officer?

22:41.544 --> 22:44.145
- Um, I love everything
about eddie.

22:44.147 --> 22:46.981
Had the-- have the utmost
respect for him.

22:46.983 --> 22:50.217
Um, I thought his opinion
and everything--

22:50.219 --> 22:52.386
anything how he felt,
you know,

22:52.388 --> 22:54.688
I respect it, so, yeah.

22:54.690 --> 22:57.825
- Um, it was a bumpy season
for the deck crew.

22:57.827 --> 23:00.561
Lee, who do you think
is-is truly to blame

23:00.563 --> 23:03.697
for the problems that they
experienced this season?

23:03.699 --> 23:06.734
- Well, ultimately,
the blame lies with me.

23:08.571 --> 23:11.372
And it's up to me
to observe and--

23:11.374 --> 23:14.775
and recognize the problems
that they're having...

23:15.745 --> 23:18.679
And take care of 'em.

23:18.681 --> 23:20.014
- Eddie, do you think jake

23:20.016 --> 23:21.916
was ultimately
a good lead deckhand,

23:21.918 --> 23:25.052
or did he let the role
go to his head

23:25.054 --> 23:28.989
and unnecessarily boss
rayna and wes around?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.958
- Uh, when he did
get in the position,

23:30.960 --> 23:34.195
he might have got a little big
for his britches at first.

23:34.197 --> 23:36.464
I think he was,
uh, you know, just--

23:36.466 --> 23:37.798
just got a little
ahead of himself.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.202
- Obviously, because he didn't
wear his britches that often.

23:41.204 --> 23:44.939
[laughter]
- isn't that the truth?

23:44.941 --> 23:48.809
- That was so--
oh, perfect timing.

23:48.811 --> 23:49.977
- But at the end of the day,
you know,

23:49.979 --> 23:52.279
I think he became a great--
a good leader, you know.

23:52.281 --> 23:55.316
- Um, rayna, kathy m.
Wants to know,

23:55.318 --> 23:57.017
"why did you sign
up for this?

23:57.019 --> 24:00.354
"it seems like you don't like
being called out or corrected

24:00.356 --> 24:02.523
"and roll your
eyes constantly."

24:02.525 --> 24:04.658
- why did I sign up for this?
What are--

24:04.660 --> 24:08.863
what's her name? Kathy?
- Yeah, kathy m. Kathy m.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.764
Tell her.
- Well--

24:10.766 --> 24:12.766
[laughs]

24:12.768 --> 24:15.536
I love you. Well, the thing is,
my issue is,

24:15.538 --> 24:17.805
like, context to all this,
you know?

24:17.807 --> 24:21.308
Like, when captain lee asked us
to do the gas, for example.

24:21.310 --> 24:23.043
- Hey, guys, just a reminder,
as soon as you're done,

24:23.045 --> 24:27.314
[indistinct]
- sick.

24:27.316 --> 24:28.382
- Cue the eye roll.

24:28.384 --> 24:32.386
- Yeah. Did you see it?
- Uh-huh. Sure did.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.755
If I see it again,
it's gonna be an issue.

24:34.757 --> 24:37.057
- I-- out of everyone
that was standing there,

24:37.059 --> 24:39.026
and wes can sit here
and vouch for this,

24:39.028 --> 24:42.096
I was the one person
not talking sh--.

24:42.098 --> 24:44.465
I was-- they were talking
about penises,

24:44.467 --> 24:46.800
and that's why I was
rolling my eyes.

24:46.802 --> 24:48.802
I love yachting.
I love it.

24:48.804 --> 24:52.006
- Wes, what do you say?
- Yeah, I was joking with her.

24:52.008 --> 24:55.176
I was like, so we have one
person filling the tank,

24:55.178 --> 24:57.278
one person holding the rag,
and, you know,

24:57.280 --> 24:58.612
we're just standing
there, like,

24:58.614 --> 25:00.347
all right, what's
the third person do?

25:00.349 --> 25:02.449
I didn't expect captain lee
to ever hear,

25:02.451 --> 25:03.918
so sorry about that.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.753
I was just finding a little
humor and getting through it.

25:05.755 --> 25:09.523
- No, no. No need
to apologize.

25:09.525 --> 25:11.292
- Eddie, what do you say?

25:11.294 --> 25:13.327
- Captain lee gets to walk
around and be grumpy,

25:13.329 --> 25:15.095
because it's captain.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.597
He's the top of the chain.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.465
He doesn't have to roll
his eyes at anybody,

25:18.467 --> 25:19.833
because there's
nobody above him.

25:19.835 --> 25:21.802
Uh, if I rolled my eyes
at captain lee,

25:21.804 --> 25:24.238
he would take that
as a-a sign of disrespect.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.941
Uh, you know, if anybody else,
you know,

25:26.943 --> 25:29.243
rolled their eyes at me,
it's the same-same way.

25:29.245 --> 25:31.679
It's a-- it's a disrespectful
thing to do.

25:31.681 --> 25:34.215
- Lee, what was your overall
take on the deck crew,

25:34.217 --> 25:35.382
uh, this season?

25:35.384 --> 25:38.219
Did they improve over time?

25:38.221 --> 25:42.056
Would you bring back eddie
as first officer again?

25:42.058 --> 25:45.226
- They did improve
over time, and--

25:45.228 --> 25:47.027
but it was just--

25:47.029 --> 25:50.698
there were such lapses

25:50.700 --> 25:54.001
at-at the most
inopportune times

25:54.003 --> 25:57.438
that just like--
that were just glaring.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.040
Eddie was in a new role,

26:00.042 --> 26:03.911
and a difficult-- that's
a difficult transition to make

26:03.913 --> 26:07.047
from-from deck crew
to first officer.

26:07.049 --> 26:09.283
That's hard.
That's really hard,

26:09.285 --> 26:12.720
because your plate just
went from half-empty

26:12.722 --> 26:15.022
to overflowing.

26:15.024 --> 26:16.490
It's a hard
transition to do.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.726
- And, eddie, what are
you up to now?

26:18.728 --> 26:20.094
- Uh, still in baltimore.

26:20.096 --> 26:23.530
Still running tugboats
as the first officer

26:23.532 --> 26:27.601
in baltimore harbor, and just,
uh, having a good time.

26:27.603 --> 26:28.936
Tug life, you know?

26:28.938 --> 26:32.072
- Tug life.
#tuglife.

26:32.074 --> 26:34.775
[overlapping chatter]

26:34.777 --> 26:36.277
all right, we're gonna
leave it there.

26:36.279 --> 26:38.846
We're gonna be right back.
Coming up...

26:38.848 --> 26:41.081
What was your point
in asking her about it?

26:41.083 --> 26:43.550
To sabotage her?
Or what was your point?

26:43.552 --> 26:44.985
- If-if I asked about--

26:44.987 --> 26:47.254
if-if I asked
about this...

26:53.161 --> 26:54.428
- We are back with more

26:54.430 --> 26:56.063
of the "below deck"
season nine reunion.

26:56.065 --> 26:57.665
I'm andy cohen.

26:57.667 --> 27:00.134
Well, one of the most dramatic
moments of this season

27:00.136 --> 27:02.936
actually happened
off the vessel.

27:02.938 --> 27:06.674
During a crew night out,
heather used the n-word,

27:06.676 --> 27:09.877
a word that white people
should never say

27:09.879 --> 27:13.180
under any circumstances ever.

27:13.182 --> 27:15.215
Let's take a look back
at what happened

27:15.217 --> 27:16.784
and the aftermath,

27:16.786 --> 27:19.219
and we'll discuss
on the other side.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.523
- Hello.
[indistinct] we're here.

27:26.762 --> 27:28.729
She thought it was cool,
and it hurts me.

27:28.731 --> 27:31.365
It hurts my heart.
It hurts everything in me.

27:35.838 --> 27:36.920
- You know, you can't
say those things.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.605
Try to separate
what's happening personally

27:38.607 --> 27:42.076
with what's happening
on deck.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.778
- The lesson here is, yeah, it
should never be ----ing said,

27:44.780 --> 27:47.498
regardless of my way
to create a friendship.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.950
It was so wrongly done.

27:49.952 --> 27:52.820
- I just wanted you to know that
I'm not that person at all,

27:52.822 --> 27:55.255
and I just want to apologize
for that whole situation.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.425
- I appreciate the apology.
I don't want you to feel upset.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.994
I just want us to, like,
move in a positive direction.

28:00.996 --> 28:02.730
Do you get what I mean?
- I am so sorry.

28:02.732 --> 28:04.031
- Come here. Come here.
It's okay.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.432
- Because you're beautiful--
- if she wanted to apologize,

28:05.434 --> 28:07.267
she could've apologized after
the sh-- happened.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.503
Just over it.
Like, absolutely over it.

28:09.505 --> 28:10.871
- I was kind of looking
for you for help,

28:10.873 --> 28:13.057
and you kind of shrugged it off,
so that made me feel like,

28:13.059 --> 28:14.975
"oh, I can't even really
trust him about--"

28:14.977 --> 28:17.111
- I hope you know
that's not the case.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.546
I do not have any patience
for that whatsoever.

28:19.548 --> 28:21.715
- Mmm-hmm.
- Can you trust me?

28:21.717 --> 28:22.950
- We shall see.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.568
- You didn't feel like I backed
you up or supported you,

28:24.570 --> 28:26.987
and I am so sorry
for that.

28:26.989 --> 28:29.173
Would you like if
I grabbed heather

28:29.175 --> 28:31.859
and we just killed this thing.
- No.

28:31.861 --> 28:33.360
- Okay, if you don't feel
comfortable talking to her,

28:33.362 --> 28:34.762
then I will
respect that.

28:34.764 --> 28:38.115
- I don't know why she has
such an attitude with me.

28:38.117 --> 28:41.201
- I don't like white people
who say (bleep)

28:41.203 --> 28:42.786
and that's why
I don't respect you.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.172
- You told me that
everything was okay.

28:45.174 --> 28:47.040
- I've been sitting here being
calm, cool, and collected

28:47.042 --> 28:50.377
this whole season, trying
not to, like, stir things

28:50.379 --> 28:51.645
and not to be, like,
the angry black person,

28:51.647 --> 28:54.782
but there's only so
much I can handle.

28:54.784 --> 28:59.019
- So, um, heather, what
was your initial reaction

28:59.021 --> 29:01.655
when you saw the footage
of what happened

29:01.657 --> 29:04.091
with you and rayna during
that night out?

29:04.093 --> 29:07.161
- Honestly,
I was appalled.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.630
It was extremely
embarrassing.

29:09.632 --> 29:12.699
There was no right
for me to parrot her at all.

29:12.701 --> 29:14.768
I don't even know what was
going through my mind,

29:14.770 --> 29:18.405
and at the end of the day,
there's really no excuse for it.

29:18.407 --> 29:21.508
- Rayna, there was a lot
of social media commentary

29:21.510 --> 29:25.612
about you accepting heather's
apologies a couple times,

29:25.614 --> 29:28.916
and then continuing
to talk to others about it.

29:28.918 --> 29:30.684
You and I have talked
about this a little bit.

29:30.686 --> 29:31.752
- Yeah.
- So, I just want you

29:31.754 --> 29:32.820
to re explain it.

29:32.822 --> 29:36.123
Tell me, what kept you
from telling heather

29:36.125 --> 29:37.991
what you
really felt?

29:37.993 --> 29:41.962
- The first night, you know,
I stated how I just didn't--

29:41.964 --> 29:44.398
it wasn't okay.
I stated how it wasn't okay.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.468
I didn't feel like, honestly,
the apology was genuine.

29:47.470 --> 29:50.737
I accepted it because
I just wanted to work,

29:50.739 --> 29:53.640
like, cordially, and I don't
think people understand

29:53.642 --> 29:57.077
that position of being, like,
the only african-american woman

29:57.079 --> 29:58.979
and having to
deal with something

29:58.981 --> 30:01.148
that, like,
is so uncomfortable,

30:01.150 --> 30:04.051
but you also feel like
you are the burden.

30:04.053 --> 30:06.086
- The other thing that I
thought was really interesting

30:06.088 --> 30:08.822
is that you-you
talked about the trope

30:08.824 --> 30:11.625
of the angry black woman
and not wanting

30:11.627 --> 30:14.595
to kind of feed into
that trope, and that that

30:14.597 --> 30:18.332
was on your mind while shooting.
Tell me about that again.

30:18.334 --> 30:20.067
- If I would've,
like, snapped off,

30:20.069 --> 30:22.703
then what would I have been
called? Ghetto?

30:22.705 --> 30:24.905
Like, oh, like--
you know what I mean?

30:24.907 --> 30:27.174
And then when I try
to shake things off,

30:27.176 --> 30:29.776
it's like, "oh, I'm fake."
it doesn't matter

30:29.778 --> 30:33.447
what I do, because
I'm still called angry--

30:33.449 --> 30:36.049
- it's a-it's a no win
- every black woman stereotype.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.852
It's a no win, and it's
really frustrating, you know?

30:38.854 --> 30:40.754
- Um, keisha p. Emailed,

30:40.756 --> 30:43.257
"eddie, uh, when rayna
first came to you to tell you

30:43.259 --> 30:45.492
that heather said the n-word,
your reaction

30:45.494 --> 30:48.729
came across as dismissive,
uh, but you later seemed

30:48.731 --> 30:50.898
to take it much
more seriously.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.166
What was your reaction
to seeing

30:53.168 --> 30:56.136
your initial conversation
with her play back?

30:56.138 --> 30:57.671
- As you can see in
the conversation, you know,

30:57.673 --> 31:02.075
I did say, when rayna told me--
is that that was not okay,

31:02.077 --> 31:04.845
what heather said, and rayna
was completely justified

31:04.847 --> 31:06.680
in feeling angry
and feeling upset,

31:06.682 --> 31:07.648
and everything
like that.

31:07.650 --> 31:10.450
The truest thing
rayna said, not to me,

31:10.452 --> 31:12.486
but off camera, you know,
in her room, was that

31:12.488 --> 31:14.922
I don't understand,
and she's absolutely right.

31:14.924 --> 31:16.056
I don't understand.

31:16.058 --> 31:17.758
I never will understand,
you know?

31:17.760 --> 31:21.194
And the only thing I can do
is take rayna at her word,

31:21.196 --> 31:23.630
and if she says everything's
okay, and if she doesn't want

31:23.632 --> 31:25.566
to escalate this, and she
doesn't want to take it further,

31:25.568 --> 31:29.770
then I have to respect her,
and that's how I can take it,

31:29.772 --> 31:33.874
but I-I am sorry for rayna
not feeling that I was an ally,

31:33.876 --> 31:35.876
that I was a friend, and that
she couldn't come to me,

31:35.878 --> 31:36.843
and be honest with me,

31:36.845 --> 31:38.679
and tell me how
she was truly feeling,

31:38.681 --> 31:41.014
because it's important to me
to be that person for rayna

31:41.016 --> 31:42.683
and to be that leader,

31:42.685 --> 31:45.686
and I'm sorry for that.

31:45.688 --> 31:48.221
- Do you really, like--
do you believe that?

31:48.223 --> 31:49.990
It's more than heather
- I mean-- I-I don't--

31:49.992 --> 31:52.593
- you tried to-- it's-- no,
let me finish. Let me finish.

31:52.595 --> 31:54.061
It's more--
you can't sit here

31:54.063 --> 31:57.164
and try to say it now,
because I'm going to.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.033
I didn't feel comfortable for
a lot of different instances.

32:00.035 --> 32:03.870
Okay? Eddie apologized
to me three times.

32:03.872 --> 32:07.307
The first time he apologized
to me, you know what he did?

32:07.309 --> 32:11.411
He says, "well, but you say
the f-word when you're drunk."

32:11.413 --> 32:13.213
so, he tried to sit
here and make it seem

32:13.215 --> 32:16.183
like because I say
the f-word when I'm drunk,

32:16.185 --> 32:18.385
that excuses what
he and heather did,

32:18.387 --> 32:21.288
and I said, "well, yeah,
I say (bleep) all the time.

32:21.290 --> 32:23.223
Like, I'm grown.
I can say (bleep)."

32:23.225 --> 32:25.859
he says, "no, you say
(bleep) when you drunk."

32:28.931 --> 32:32.132
and did that, and had
the audacity to say,

32:32.134 --> 32:35.902
"do you trust me?" afterwards,
to try to make it seem

32:35.904 --> 32:38.005
like I was saying
derogatory terms as well,

32:38.007 --> 32:40.240
and I would never.
My sister is gay.

32:40.242 --> 32:42.743
When I graduated college,
I walked down the aisle

32:42.745 --> 32:46.680
with the president of the lgbtq
community, and it's crazy.

32:46.682 --> 32:49.883
So, that's why I go cry after he
tries to have me do the anchor,

32:49.885 --> 32:52.152
and that's why I feel
all these certain type of ways.

32:52.154 --> 32:55.756
You cannot do that.
You tried to ruin me, eddie.

32:55.758 --> 32:56.957
Do you get that?

32:56.959 --> 33:00.794
You tried to-- you tried
to ruin me, for what?

33:00.796 --> 33:04.731
- Eddie, what-what do you--

33:04.733 --> 33:06.900
- I mean, I don't--

33:06.902 --> 33:09.002
I don't really remember
the whole conversation.

33:09.004 --> 33:09.870
You know, that
was a year ago.

33:09.872 --> 33:11.972
If I did--
- I heard it.

33:11.974 --> 33:13.006
He said, "but I
hear you say--"

33:13.008 --> 33:13.840
- can I speak
for a second now, rayna?

33:13.842 --> 33:14.808
I think it's--
- no.

33:14.810 --> 33:18.445
- So, if-if I asked
that you used that word,

33:18.447 --> 33:20.647
I don't understand why
it's wrong for me to ask

33:20.649 --> 33:23.750
about if you use that word,
because if I-- I didn't just--

33:23.752 --> 33:26.820
I wouldn't just say that just
to try to frame you,

33:26.822 --> 33:29.122
or something like that.
I would never do that, ever.

33:29.124 --> 33:30.190
I guess what
she's saying is--

33:30.192 --> 33:31.725
- no, he said he
heard it himself.

33:31.727 --> 33:34.027
He said he heard it himself.
He said, "I--".

33:34.029 --> 33:35.395
- No, I--

33:35.397 --> 33:38.265
- he said, "but I hear you say
the f-word when you're drunk."

33:38.267 --> 33:40.934
he said, "no, no, no." he argued
with me back and forth.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.136
Back and forth
about the situation.

33:43.138 --> 33:45.639
"no, you do." I said,
"no, I didn't. I'd never."

33:45.641 --> 33:47.074
back and forth.

33:47.076 --> 33:49.676
My heart is too big to sit
here and try to ruin people,

33:49.678 --> 33:51.978
but to sit here and lie, eddie?
Don't lie.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.714
Man up
and say what you did.

33:53.716 --> 33:55.849
You're sitting here lying
to me, and that's crazy!

33:55.851 --> 33:57.918
- I-I'm not lying.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
If I said it to you,
if I asked you about it.

33:59.922 --> 34:01.722
I don't understand what's
wrong with me asking--

34:01.724 --> 34:04.424
- your point in asking her
about it-- what-what--

34:04.426 --> 34:07.394
was your point in her asking
her about to sabotage her

34:07.396 --> 34:09.696
or what was your point
in asking her?

34:09.698 --> 34:11.965
- If-if I asked about this--
- [scoffs]

34:11.967 --> 34:14.868
- let me finish rayna, please.
If I asked about this,

34:14.870 --> 34:18.805
my point is, why should I ask if
you're using a derogatory term,

34:18.807 --> 34:20.040
and what's the difference
between heather

34:20.042 --> 34:21.341
using a
derogatory term.

34:21.343 --> 34:22.943
If it's-it's okay--
- you didn't ask me.

34:22.945 --> 34:26.947
- For me to-- is it okay for me
to go to heather and ask her

34:26.949 --> 34:29.516
if she used the n-word because
that benefits you?

34:29.518 --> 34:31.618
But if you use the f-word,
it's not okay,

34:31.620 --> 34:33.019
because that's
gonna hurt you?

34:33.021 --> 34:34.287
- You didn't ask me.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.123
You sat there and said
that I said this.

34:36.125 --> 34:37.958
- This girl is over here
saying the n-word

34:37.960 --> 34:40.160
all nonchalantly
all night.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.462
- I did not hear her say
it once, all night,

34:42.464 --> 34:45.499
but I have heard you say
the f-word a few times,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.701
and you need to watch that.
- Like, what do you mean?

34:47.703 --> 34:48.935
Like, when we're
working alone?

34:48.937 --> 34:51.755
- Like homophobia.
Like homophobic f-word.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.640
- I've never in my life
said that, never.

34:53.642 --> 34:54.875
- Really?
- Never.

34:54.877 --> 34:55.708
- I think I've heard it.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.710
- I've never in my life.
- Okay.

34:57.712 --> 34:59.546
- Never. I'd never
say that.

34:59.548 --> 35:00.897
That's not even
in my vocabulary.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.783
- Okay.
- Look, I know that's not true.

35:02.785 --> 35:04.701
- All right, well, I-I--
you've been drunk a few times,

35:04.703 --> 35:06.203
and I've heard it,
but it's okay.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.288
Maybe it wasn't you.
- I don't believe that.

35:08.290 --> 35:11.458
- I was told production was
unable to corroborate the story,

35:11.460 --> 35:13.927
and there was one mention
of it on camera,

35:13.929 --> 35:16.563
and that is why they chose not
to include it on the show.

35:16.565 --> 35:18.899
- I'm sure. I'm sure.
I'm sure.

35:18.901 --> 35:21.535
And my issue is, like, for--
like I'm saying--

35:21.537 --> 35:24.504
- no, no, rayna,
it's that you didn't--

35:24.506 --> 35:29.209
the corroboration was that
you didn't say the word.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.911
- Okay, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:30.913 --> 35:34.648
- Material girl. I love you.
Okay? Material girl.

35:34.650 --> 35:38.251
But the whole point of it is
that eddie still tried to use it

35:38.253 --> 35:41.822
to, like, say that I said it.
You get what I mean?

35:41.824 --> 35:42.889
And he thought that
was gonna slide.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.891
- Okay, I wanna move on.
I wanna move forward,

35:44.893 --> 35:46.626
because I have more
questions about this.

35:46.628 --> 35:48.395
Heather, ellen l. Said,

35:48.397 --> 35:50.664
"after seeing rayna's
conversation with wes

35:50.666 --> 35:52.065
"about how she didn't
want to come off

35:52.067 --> 35:53.767
"as an aggressive
black woman,

35:53.769 --> 35:55.602
"do you now have
a better understanding

35:55.604 --> 35:57.504
"of why she was
sending mixed messages

35:57.506 --> 36:00.473
"by saying things were fine,
and they clearly weren't?"

36:00.475 --> 36:02.576
- I wish I would have known
her true feelings

36:02.578 --> 36:04.311
so I could have
acted accordingly

36:04.313 --> 36:05.612
and given her
her space.

36:05.614 --> 36:07.447
She has every right to feel
the way she does,

36:07.449 --> 36:10.283
and I am at fault for that.
No one else.

36:10.285 --> 36:12.986
- Heather, like, I wish nothing
but the best for you,

36:12.988 --> 36:14.521
and I don't think
you're racist.

36:14.523 --> 36:16.456
And I think people
are, like, delusional

36:16.458 --> 36:17.724
in that way.

36:17.726 --> 36:19.626
Like, the fact that people are
even calling you racist--

36:19.628 --> 36:23.330
I think it's a lack of--
like, I think it's ignorance.

36:23.332 --> 36:25.165
You get what I mean?

36:25.167 --> 36:27.400
- No, I agree.
It's ignorance.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.136
- Eddie, kathy c. Said, "on
'watch what happens live,'

36:30.138 --> 36:32.205
"rayna said that you
reacted more strongly

36:32.207 --> 36:33.406
"when she called
out heather

36:33.408 --> 36:35.675
"for sticking her finger
in the crew dinner

36:35.677 --> 36:38.311
"than when she told him that
heather said the n-word."

36:50.826 --> 36:53.226
how do you
respond to that?

36:53.228 --> 36:54.961
- Uh, I don't think
that's really true.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.830
I mean, there's a lot that
happened that we didn't see

36:56.832 --> 36:58.632
about me going
to captain lee

36:58.634 --> 37:01.868
and talking to him about
what happened between heather,

37:01.870 --> 37:04.304
um, and, you know,
the whole thing--

37:04.306 --> 37:05.906
and the fingers
in the food, I mean,

37:05.908 --> 37:08.208
she used a piece of bread
to scoop up some sauce.

37:08.210 --> 37:10.277
I mean, I-it really
wasn't that big a deal.

37:10.279 --> 37:12.178
- But I'll even be
the first to say that, yeah,

37:12.180 --> 37:13.380
that was messed up.

37:13.382 --> 37:14.948
I'll be the first to say,
yeah, that's gross,

37:14.950 --> 37:16.983
and I probably would have
had the same reaction.

37:16.985 --> 37:19.119
- Let me ask you this.
Did you double dip?

37:19.121 --> 37:21.488
I was wondering,
did she double dip?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.490
- No. No.
- Because I would be really--

37:23.492 --> 37:24.858
- you did double dip, girl.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.126
[overlapping chatter]

37:26.128 --> 37:27.994
- oh, rayna, it was
a double dip?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.596
- I don't know.
Play back the footage.

37:29.598 --> 37:31.531
To my knowledge,
I never double--

37:31.533 --> 37:33.266
that's a gross thing.
- Heather, if it was

37:33.268 --> 37:36.503
a double dip, man.
- It was a double dip, girl.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.505
And I was lookin' at heather,
and I was starin' at heather,

37:38.507 --> 37:40.040
like, girl--
- you know what?

37:40.042 --> 37:42.342
It was nine months ago.
I can't remember.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.945
- Do not double dip.
- You're fine, heather.

37:44.947 --> 37:47.347
You're fine.
- Okay, um, captain lee,

37:47.349 --> 37:49.716
um, what's your take
on the whole situation

37:49.718 --> 37:52.218
on everything
that went down?

37:52.220 --> 37:54.020
- Heather apologized.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.689
The apology was accepted.

37:55.691 --> 37:59.459
Now does that mean that
it was handled perfectly?

38:01.563 --> 38:04.564
No, I-I don't believe that.

38:04.566 --> 38:07.200
But there's been
a thorough investigation

38:07.202 --> 38:09.903
and interviews with
the entire yacht crew,

38:09.905 --> 38:13.840
and several members of
the, uh, production team

38:13.842 --> 38:16.242
who were all
involved in it,

38:16.244 --> 38:19.212
and at the conclusion,
it was determined

38:19.214 --> 38:21.815
that no further action
was required.

38:21.817 --> 38:25.285
I-I think that's a basis
for us to move forward

38:25.287 --> 38:28.121
and try to do better
in the future.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.594
- Did you and rayna ever
get a chance to discuss

38:34.596 --> 38:37.530
what happened between
the two of you?

38:37.532 --> 38:38.865
- Um...

38:44.205 --> 38:45.538
- All right,
we are back,

38:45.540 --> 38:47.707
and before we jump ship
from season nine,

38:47.709 --> 38:49.776
I have a few
more questions.

38:49.778 --> 38:52.779
Wes, chelsea t. Said,
"your attempt

38:52.781 --> 38:55.281
"to diffuse the situation
with heather

38:55.283 --> 38:57.517
"really bl up
in your face."

38:57.519 --> 38:59.519
- walk the (bleep) away.
- You should understand!

38:59.521 --> 39:01.054
- I do understand.
- Shut the (bleep) up!

39:01.056 --> 39:02.789
- Shut the (bleep) up, wes!
- I'm not gonna

39:02.791 --> 39:04.691
shut the (bleep) up, because--
- your stupid white ass.

39:04.693 --> 39:06.292
You're white just like
these mother----ers.

39:06.294 --> 39:08.745
- The one person that you got--
- you're not black though.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.647
- See? Get the (bleep) out.
I don't--

39:10.649 --> 39:13.600
I don't appreciate that sh--.
- Did you and rayna

39:13.602 --> 39:16.036
ever get a chance
to discuss what happened

39:16.038 --> 39:19.039
between the two of you
after the season ended

39:19.041 --> 39:21.674
and-and where are
the two of you now?

39:21.676 --> 39:23.643
- Um, not fully.

39:23.645 --> 39:25.612
I would love to
discuss it further,

39:25.614 --> 39:28.882
um, more in private.

39:28.884 --> 39:30.483
Yeah, it did--
it did hurt.

39:30.485 --> 39:33.820
I mean, but--
I mean, no--

39:33.822 --> 39:35.155
I-I get it
all the time.

39:35.157 --> 39:38.458
Like, the half black thing,
the "you're not black" thing,

39:38.460 --> 39:39.559
that kind of stuff.

39:39.561 --> 39:42.328
And so I get it. It's all right.
It's all right.

39:42.330 --> 39:44.697
I mean, I'm still here
for her if she wants.

39:44.699 --> 39:46.833
Um, everybody
makes mistakes.

39:46.835 --> 39:48.535
Everybody needs to learn
from their mistakes.

39:48.537 --> 39:50.203
And for everybody watching,

39:50.205 --> 39:53.073
please let this be
a teachable moment,

39:53.075 --> 39:54.407
because it's not acceptable,

39:54.409 --> 39:55.809
any derogatory term

39:55.811 --> 39:58.144
for anybody that's a part
of the disenfranchised,

39:58.146 --> 40:01.848
not just african american,
but anybody.

40:01.850 --> 40:05.018
- Well, heather and rayna,
I'm wondering, um,

40:05.020 --> 40:07.587
final thoughts
from you

40:07.589 --> 40:09.989
about what you learned
from all this.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.991
I-I'm gonna let you
go first, heather,

40:11.993 --> 40:15.061
and then I'll go
to you, rayna.

40:15.063 --> 40:18.031
- The word should've never,
ever been used, at all.

40:18.033 --> 40:21.034
And, you know what?
At the end of the day,

40:21.036 --> 40:23.903
it's probably one of
the biggest regrets of my life,

40:23.905 --> 40:26.106
and the shameful thing is

40:26.108 --> 40:29.576
that context
is everything,

40:29.578 --> 40:31.311
but there's no excuse,

40:31.313 --> 40:33.279
and it's something
I live with,

40:33.281 --> 40:36.616
and, rayna, whether you think
it's genuine or not,

40:36.618 --> 40:38.017
from the bottom
of my heart,

40:38.019 --> 40:40.920
I am so sorry that I did this
and this happened,

40:40.922 --> 40:44.090
and that I spoke a word
I should have never spoken,

40:44.092 --> 40:45.859
and from there, I just...
- Okay.

40:45.861 --> 40:48.261
- ...Keep trying to grow
and be a better person.

40:50.499 --> 40:53.900
- Rayna, final thought
from you?

40:53.902 --> 40:57.737
- Um, this whole experience
was just, like, a lot.

40:57.739 --> 41:01.141
Like, it was a lot,
and, um, I just--

41:01.143 --> 41:04.244
it was-- it was hard.
Like, all of it was just hard.

41:04.246 --> 41:06.312
And heather, I just want--
all I want heather to know

41:06.314 --> 41:09.249
is that I don't
hate you.

41:09.251 --> 41:10.250
You know what I mean?

41:10.252 --> 41:13.052
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you

41:13.054 --> 41:13.987
or anything like that.

41:13.989 --> 41:15.755
I wish nothing
but the best for you.

41:15.757 --> 41:19.526
- Um, lee, bonnie u. Wants
to know who on the crew

41:19.528 --> 41:21.861
demonstrated the best
work ethic

41:21.863 --> 41:23.796
during your time
on the boat.

41:23.798 --> 41:26.132
Who gets your
gold star tonight?

41:26.134 --> 41:28.535
- I'm gonna hand that
to wes.

41:28.537 --> 41:32.038
- Oh, wow!
To wes!

41:32.040 --> 41:34.440
- Wes kept his-his
head down,

41:34.442 --> 41:36.976
kept his-his focus,

41:36.978 --> 41:40.613
and he just did
what he had to do.

41:40.615 --> 41:45.385
He, you know, he accepted
the errors that he had,

41:45.387 --> 41:48.821
and he just
went forward,

41:48.823 --> 41:52.325
and so, I mean,
I can't ask any--

41:52.327 --> 41:53.760
any more than that,

41:53.762 --> 41:58.097
and I just wish wes
all the continued success

41:58.099 --> 41:59.766
that I know
he's gonna have

41:59.768 --> 42:01.901
in the, uh,
in the virgin islands,

42:01.903 --> 42:04.470
'cause he's gonna make
a hell of a captain.

42:04.472 --> 42:06.706
He is a captain.
He's gonna make a--

42:06.708 --> 42:09.342
- he is a captain.

42:09.344 --> 42:11.444
- Go, wes!

42:11.446 --> 42:12.478
- Thank you, captain.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.113
I-I really do
appreciate that,

42:14.115 --> 42:16.115
and, uh, it means
a lot to me.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.951
Thank you.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.954
- Um, fraser, you are
a chief stew now.

42:20.956 --> 42:23.623
What's the biggest
lesson you've learned?

42:23.625 --> 42:26.492
- You know, um,
it's about--

42:26.494 --> 42:28.561
I mean, heather told me this
early days as well.

42:28.563 --> 42:30.296
It's all about
the bigger picture.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.966
Um, I'm quite used to just
honing in on one issue

42:32.968 --> 42:34.434
and that being my world

42:34.436 --> 42:35.568
and it just
tearing me down,

42:35.570 --> 42:37.870
but every small step
in yachting,

42:37.872 --> 42:39.706
and every piece of advice
you get given is--

42:39.708 --> 42:42.508
it's all-- it's all contributing
towards a bigger picture,

42:42.510 --> 42:44.510
and, um, and, yeah.

42:44.512 --> 42:46.813
That's excellent, heather.
Thank you.

42:46.815 --> 42:50.049
- Um, well, I want to thank
the crew of "my seanna"

42:50.051 --> 42:51.150
for being here

42:51.152 --> 42:53.620
and for a wild
charter season.

42:53.622 --> 42:55.989
I'm andy cohen.
Good night, everybody.
