"AGES 17 AND OLDER."

03:15.766 --> 03:17.298
OH, REALLY?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.198
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN
A GREAT THING FOR ME TO GET HIM.

SO PUT BOTH OF OUR NAMES

07:39.059 --> 07:40.591
WHO KNOWS? I DON'T KNOW?
WHAT IF SHE DID?

07:40.591 --> 07:42.062
IT'S NOT WHY I'M DOING IT.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.635
NO. NO, I WON'T HAVE THIS.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.997
A BEARD ISMYTHING.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

07:46.997 --> 07:48.599
I MUST INSIST
THAT YOU SHAVE IT.

07:48.599 --> 07:49.740
(scoffs) I'M SORRY, KENNY,

07:49.740 --> 07:52.072
BUT A PERSON CANNOT OWN A BEARD.
YOU SHAVE IT!

07:52.072 --> 07:54.545
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT!

07:54.545 --> 07:56.747
I GOT IT, THE PERFECT GIFT
FOR NATHAN.

07:56.747 --> 07:57.908
YOU GOING WITH THE ALLIGATOR?

07:57.908 --> 07:59.179
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GRABBING LUNCH.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.981
DO YOU GUYS WEAR WATCHES?
IT'S 10:15.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.888
SO COME ON. TELL ME WHAT
YOU GOT HIM. IS IT A TRAMPOLINE?

08:07.888 --> 08:09.590
(scoffs) A TRAMPOLINE?
WE'LL BE LUCKY

08:09.590 --> 08:11.491
IF HE DOESN'T BREAK HIS LEG
IN THE BOUNCE HOUSE.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.123
OOH! IS IT THOSE MARACAS
HE'S BEEN WANTING?

08:13.123 --> 08:16.166
YEAH, BECAUSE, UH,
NOTHING SAYS "MAN" LIKE MARACAS.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.968
AND THEN
SHE STARTED REMINISCING

08:17.968 --> 08:19.730
ABOUT HOW I USED TO SING
"BROWN EYED GIRL"

08:19.730 --> 08:21.001
IN HER DORM ROOM.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.603
OHH. I LOVE THAT SONG.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.635
SHE'S GETTING MARRIEDTODAY,

08:24.635 --> 08:26.106
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE REALLY WANTS TO.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.908
THAT'S WHY
SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.110
MM.
SO DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.682
SHE WANTS ME TO DO SOMETHING,
RIGHT? I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

08:31.682 --> 08:34.514
I SHOULD REACH OUT
AND I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.646
NO, CRAIG, I TOLD YOU.

08:35.646 --> 08:37.648
SHE'S JUST FEELING NOSTALGIC.
THAT'S ALL.

08:37.648 --> 08:40.851
OH, I TOTALLY DISAGREE. SHE
WANTS YOU YOU COME AFTER HER.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.693
YOU THINK?
(Will, Theresa, and Kenny) NO!

08:42.693 --> 08:44.124
YOU NUT BAG.
TOTALLY, CRAIG.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.256
I MEAN, THIS GIRL IS
YOUR SOUL MATE.

08:46.256 --> 08:47.828
YOU CAN'T LET HER GET AWAY.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.000
I MEAN, ONCE YOU REALIZE
THAT SOMEONE IS YOUR SOUL MATE,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.161
IT'S FOREVER.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.532
(scoffs)

08:52.532 --> 08:55.105
YOU SAIDIWAS YOUR SOUL MATE.

08:55.105 --> 08:58.168
MYSOUL MATE
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE,

08:58.168 --> 09:01.211
AND HE'S BRINGING LEMON BARS.

09:01.211 --> 09:02.813
OKAY.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.875
I CAN'T PROMISE THAT
THIS LITTLE BIRTHDAY PARTY

09:04.875 --> 09:06.717
ISN'T GONNA TURN INTO
AN ALL-OUT BLOODBATH!

09:06.717 --> 09:09.620
WAIT. HEY, HEY, HEY.
W.W.T.M.D.

09:09.620 --> 09:10.621
RIGHT.
OKAY?

09:10.621 --> 09:11.722
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

09:11.722 --> 09:13.954
YES. (sighs) THANK YOU.
I'M IN CHARGE. RIGHT.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.887
THIS GUY'S JUST SOME LOSER.
HE'S NO THREAT TO ME.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.659
YEAH.
HE'S NOBODY. HE'S NOTHING.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.731
HE'S... AN UNDERWEAR MODEL.

09:20.731 --> 09:21.762
HI, FOLKS.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.834
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.667
BREND HAS TOLD ME SO MUCH
ABOUT ALL OF YOU.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.798
YOU MUST BE THERESA.

09:27.798 --> 09:29.970
OH. (giggles)
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.241
THERE'S THE BIRTHDAY BOY!

09:31.241 --> 09:32.302
THANKS!

09:32.302 --> 09:35.105
YOU MUST BE WILL,
MAN OF THE HOUSE.

09:35.105 --> 09:37.207
IT'S A PLEASURE.
HELLO.

09:39.109 --> 09:41.812
AND YOU MUST BE KEN.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.284
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THIS TO BE AWKWARD FOR US.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.216
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I RESPECT YOU.

09:46.216 --> 09:49.259
YOU AND BREND ARE CONNECTED.
I GET THAT.

09:49.259 --> 09:51.922
SO IF WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR,
THEN I SAY LET'S DO IT.

09:51.922 --> 09:56.326
AND THEN... LET'S GROW
TO BE CLOSE FRIENDS.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.171
WHATEVER, DUDE. (sighs)

10:01.171 --> 10:03.634
(children laughing)

10:03.634 --> 10:04.935
GOOD JOB.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.709
YOU'RE HANDLING THIS WELL.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.711
OF COURSE I AM.
I'M AN ADULT.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.942
AH!
(groans)

10:11.942 --> 10:13.113
THAT'S GOOD. I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D BE INTIMIDATED

10:13.113 --> 10:16.216
BECAUSE
HE'S SO TALL AND HANDSOME.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.649
OH, HE'S GOOD AT BASKETBALL.
I'M GOOD AT BASKETBALL.

10:18.649 --> 10:19.820
HE'S BETTER.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.821
OHH! (chuckles)

10:20.821 --> 10:22.793
GRANT!

10:23.954 --> 10:25.726
THROW ME THE PILL.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.897
LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE. MM!

10:26.897 --> 10:28.158
OH, I'M SORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.000
BEAT IT.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.338
WE'LL GO
WITH SHIRTS AND SKINS.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.140
THAT WAY, THERE'S NO CONFUSION
ABOUT WHO'S ON WHAT TEAM.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.849
(Kenny) THAT WAS A FOUL.
I'M NOT GONNA CALL IT...

10:48.849 --> 10:50.350
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.882
'CAUSE I'M COOL LIKE THAT.
WHAT? WHAT AM I DOING?

10:51.882 --> 10:53.854
B., I HAVE KNOWN YOU
SINCE THE NINTH GRADE,

10:53.854 --> 10:54.985
AND EVEN THEN YOU WERE
PLAYING THESE STUPID GAMES,

10:54.985 --> 10:56.386
TRYING TO
MAKE MY BROTHER CRAZY.

10:56.386 --> 10:58.729
OH, THERESA.
(Kenny) IT'S ME.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.961
NO, GRANT'S A PART
OF MY LIFE NOW.
(ball hits backboard)

11:00.961 --> 11:02.292
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MAKING KENNY JEALOUS.

11:02.292 --> 11:04.194
IT'S ABOUT ME MOVING ON

11:04.194 --> 11:05.796
AND FINDING A FUTURE
WITH THIS GUY.

11:05.796 --> 11:08.398
(panting) THAT'S TRAVELING,
AND ALSO YOU HURT ME.

11:08.398 --> 11:09.770
REALLY?

11:09.770 --> 11:12.102
WHAT'S HIS LAST NAME?

11:12.102 --> 11:13.143
PLEASE.

11:13.143 --> 11:14.905
DOES HE EVEN NEED ONE?

11:14.905 --> 11:16.847
THAT'S NOT FAIR. HE'S CHEATING.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

11:16.847 --> 11:19.149
KENNY? KENNY!
WHERE YOU GOING?

11:19.149 --> 11:21.812
AND PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON!

11:21.812 --> 11:24.414
IS IT A SLINGSHOT?
NOPE.

11:24.414 --> 11:26.456
IS IT A CHEMISTRY SET?
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.889
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONLY
A FATHER WOULD GIVE HIS SON,

11:28.889 --> 11:31.962
SOMETHING THAT
ONLY I WOULD GIVE NATHAN.

11:31.962 --> 11:35.425
DAD, GRANT GAVE ME
A SHAVING KIT!

11:38.799 --> 11:40.831
IS IT A SHAVING KIT?

11:40.831 --> 11:41.872
A SHAVING KIT.

11:41.872 --> 11:44.704
WHO GIVES A SHAVING KIT
TO A KID HE'S NEVER MET?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.307
A TOUCHY-FEELY JACKASS,
THAT'S WHO.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.309
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HIT THE MALL.
KENNY, I NEED YOU IN DVDs.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.881
LOOK FOR CLASSICS,

11:50.881 --> 11:53.143
ANYTHING THAT SPEAKS TO
A BOY'S TRANSITION TO MANHOOD.

11:53.143 --> 11:54.714
NOTHING WITH BRENDAN FRASER.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.846
DUH.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.918
CRAIG, YOU AND I WILL HIT,
UH, MUSIC, GADGETS.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.990
(crying)

11:59.990 --> 12:01.992
(turns off engine)

12:01.992 --> 12:04.294
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:04.294 --> 12:06.797
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
I NEED CLOSURE.

12:06.797 --> 12:08.428
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.730
CLOSURE! I NEED CLOSURE!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.903
YOU NEED TO CLOSURE VAGINA.

12:12.903 --> 12:14.905
(panting)

12:14.905 --> 12:16.236
IS THAT LISA'S CHURCH?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.938
I NEED TO SEE HER.
OH, MY GOD.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.909
OKAY, IF I JUST SEE HER
GETTING MARRIED,

12:18.909 --> 12:20.740
THEN MAYBE
I WILL HAVE CLOSURE.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.972
CRAIG, IF I'M NOT HOME
TO CUT THE CAKE IN 30 MINUTES,

12:21.972 --> 12:23.513
THERESA'S GONNA KILL ME.

12:23.513 --> 12:26.016
I KNOW. IT'LL TAKE TWO SECONDS.
I-I JUST--I NEED TO SEE HER.

12:26.016 --> 12:31.782
OKAY, FINE. GO. GO. JUST... GO.
GET YOUR--YOUR CLOSURE.

12:31.782 --> 12:34.124
(sighs)

12:34.124 --> 12:35.826
WHAT KIND OF A CAKE
ARE WE HAVING?

12:35.826 --> 12:36.957
IT'S FOR THE KIDS, KENNY.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.128
OKAY.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.831
OH, FLUFF ME!
HE'S GOT HIS GUITAR!

12:40.831 --> 12:42.062

12:42.062 --> 12:44.965

16:11.271 --> 16:13.243
MY--
NO.

16:13.243 --> 16:15.445
(cell phone clatters)
WE'RE NOT CALLING
THE POLICE.

16:15.445 --> 16:17.247
YOU THINK OUR FATHERS
WOULD'VE CALLED THE POLICE?

16:17.247 --> 16:19.279
NO. THEY WOULD BE
OUT ON THE LAWN RIGHT NOW.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.510
THEY WOULDN'T
BE SINGING IN CHURCHES

16:20.510 --> 16:23.083
OR--OR SEARCHING
FOR SPECIAL BIRTHDAY GIFTS.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.415
THEY WERE MEN,REALMEN--

16:25.415 --> 16:28.188
NOT THE OVER-EVOLVED GENERATION
OF PANTYWAISTS

16:28.188 --> 16:29.989
THAT WE'VE BECOME.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.221
IT'S TIME TO MAN UP!

16:31.221 --> 16:32.362
CRAIG?

16:32.362 --> 16:34.164
IF I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR LISA,
I'LL FIGHT FOR LISA.

16:34.164 --> 16:36.166
GOOD. KENNY?

16:36.166 --> 16:38.468
I AM TOBEY FLUFFIN' MAGUIRE.

16:38.468 --> 16:39.769
WHAT?

16:39.769 --> 16:42.172
OKAY, CRAIG, STAY ON THE PORCH,
KEEP AN EYE ON THE LIMO.

16:42.172 --> 16:44.734
KENNY, GO THROUGH THE GARAGE,
GET NATHAN'S HOCKEY STICK,

16:44.734 --> 16:46.536
AND COVER MY FLANK
ON THE DRIVEWAY.

16:46.536 --> 16:48.078
AYE, AYE, SKIPPER.
GOOD.

16:48.078 --> 16:49.209
WHAT DO I DO, WILL?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.641
NO. NO!
WILL, HE IS NOT ON THIS TEAM.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.583
KENNY, IS THIS ABOUT
THE BASKETBALL GAME?

16:53.583 --> 16:55.515
JUST STAY ON THE PORCH
WITH CRAIG.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.646
DON'T WORRY.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.149
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING COOL.

16:59.149 --> 17:02.222
NO, NO, GRANT,
DON'T DO ANYTHING.
I GET IT.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
NO, DON'T "GET" ANYTHING.
THERE'S NOTHING TO GET.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.026
(whispers) GOT IT.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.162
ALL RIGHT.

17:17.507 --> 17:18.708
HEY, FELLAS.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.470
(wind whistles, bird cries)

17:20.470 --> 17:22.612
MIND PUTTING UP THE FLAG
ON THE MAILBOX?

17:22.612 --> 17:24.214
I GOT A LETTER GOING OUT.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.645
WE WANT HIM.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.049
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

17:32.482 --> 17:34.624
HOCKEY STICK. HOCKEY STICK.

17:34.624 --> 17:36.326
HOCKEY STICK. HOCKEY--

17:36.326 --> 17:38.258
HOW DO THEY FIND ANYTHING
IN THIS MESS?!

17:38.258 --> 17:41.060
LOOK, UH,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.094
YOU GUYS--YOU GUYS DON'T
WANNA DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

17:44.094 --> 17:45.335
(bird cries)

17:48.138 --> 17:50.100
(slapping pogo stick)

17:50.100 --> 17:52.502
YOU NEED TO CLEAN
YOUR GARAGE.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.605
HE RUINED MY WEDDING,
AND WE'RE GONNA KICK HIS ASS!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.549
CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

18:04.254 --> 18:07.687
BARRACUDA!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.689
UHH!
OH!

18:09.689 --> 18:10.860
OH!

18:10.860 --> 18:13.763
(Grant grunting,
punches landing)

18:16.196 --> 18:17.667
DUDE!
(Craig and Kenny laugh)

18:17.667 --> 18:19.199
THAT WAS INTENSE.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.600
DUDE, YOU WERE LIKE
A JEDI KNIGHT...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.532
WITH A POGO STICK.

18:22.532 --> 18:25.635
AND YOU WERE FREAKING EVERYBODY
OUT WITH THAT NEW BEARD.

18:25.635 --> 18:26.776
(laughs)

18:26.776 --> 18:27.837
I'M GONNA SHAVE IT.

18:27.837 --> 18:29.209
DAMN STRAIGHT.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.480
OUR FATHERS WOULD BE PROUD.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.143
TOBEY MAGUIRE WOULD BE PROUD.

18:33.143 --> 18:35.415
WELL, I'LL REMIND YOU GUYS
THAT GRANT WAS THE ONLY ONE

18:35.415 --> 18:37.887
WHO ACTUALLY
GOT INTO A FIGHT TONIGHT.

18:37.887 --> 18:39.249
THAT'S WHY HE WAS
THE ONLY ONE ARRESTED

18:39.249 --> 18:40.450
WHEN THE COPS SHOWED UP.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.623
UH, NO. UH, GRANT WAS ARRESTED
BECAUSE HE LOST HIS COOL.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.225
MM-HMM.
WE WERE ROCK STEADY.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.797
YO, ROCK STEADY, GRAB YOUR KEYS.
WE'RE GOIN'.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.360
YES, MILADY,
IWILLTAKE YOU HOME.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.362
(singsongy) HELLO!

18:52.362 --> 18:53.703
(laughs) OH, NO, MY LIEGE.

18:53.703 --> 18:55.365
YOU'RE TAKING ME
TO THE POLICE STATION

18:55.365 --> 18:56.666
TO BAIL OUT GRANT.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.369
WHAT?!NO. NO WAY.

18:59.369 --> 19:02.542
AND BRING YOUR A.T.M. CARD.
WE NEED BAIL MONEY.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.476
FINE! BUT I'M NOT TAKING OUT
ANY MORE THAN $300!
(door opens)

19:08.518 --> 19:09.879
(door closes)

19:09.879 --> 19:12.352
YOU THINK LISA MIGHT BE UPSET
ABOUT WHAT I DID TODAY?

19:12.352 --> 19:13.923
YOU MEAN THAT
YOU DESTROYED HER WEDDING,

19:13.923 --> 19:15.725
RUINED THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF HER LIFE,

19:15.725 --> 19:18.458
AND EMBARRASSED HER IN FRONT
OF EVERYONE SHE LOVES?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.290
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.431
HONEY, LISTEN--

19:21.431 --> 19:23.193
I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:23.193 --> 19:25.395
I SHOULD CALL HER.

19:25.395 --> 19:26.536
(chuckles)

19:28.438 --> 19:31.271
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD BIRTHDAY?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.573
IT WASTHEBEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.844
THE PARTY, THE FIGHT...

19:34.844 --> 19:36.446
GUESS WHAT.

19:36.446 --> 19:38.348
I KISSED SAMANTHA
IN THE BOUNCE HOUSE.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.310
THAT'S GREAT.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.615
LOOK, UM,
ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY GIFT...

19:45.615 --> 19:47.417
I WANTED TO GET YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.489
OH, YEAH. I KNOW. MOM GAVE IT
TO ME, AND I LOVE IT.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.921
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S VIOLENT AND SCARY,

19:51.921 --> 19:53.423
BUT I THINK I'M OLD ENOUGH
FOR IT NOW.

19:55.425 --> 19:58.197
(speaks indistinctly)

19:58.197 --> 20:00.300
(sighs)

20:03.473 --> 20:06.536
I THINK YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
FOR SOMETHING ELSE NOW, TOO.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.211
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THE OLD MOHASKA?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.613
EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE ONE.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.415
THANKS, DAD!

20:15.415 --> 20:16.586
(chuckles)

20:18.418 --> 20:20.420
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NATE.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.499
OH, I KNOW.
I'M A FANTASTIC FATHER.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.900
IT WAS THE PERFECT GIFT.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.663
YOU JUST GAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY
A RAZOR-SHARP KNIFE.

20:33.663 --> 20:37.507
THERESA, MY FATHER GAVE ME THAT
KNIFE WHEN I WAS NATHAN'S AGE.

20:37.507 --> 20:39.869
I'VE HAD IT FOR 20 YEARS,
AND I HAVE NEVER EVEN HAD--

20:39.869 --> 20:41.341
(Nathan) OW!

20:41.341 --> 20:43.613
MOMMY! I'M BLEEDING!

20:43.613 --> 20:46.516
UN-FLUFFIN'-BELIEVABLE.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.981
(gunfire)
MAN, GRANT REALLY TOOK IT
TO ANOTHER LEVEL

20:51.981 --> 20:53.523
WITH THAT BARRACUDA THING.
(laughs)

20:53.523 --> 20:54.654
Apparently, the key
to summoning up your courage

20:54.654 --> 20:57.557
IS YELLING OUT THE NAME
OF SOME RANDOM FISH.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.429
ORANGE ROUGHY!

20:59.429 --> 21:00.990
MAHIMAHI!

21:00.990 --> 21:02.692
MACKEREL!

21:02.692 --> 21:04.734
STURGEON!

21:04.734 --> 21:06.596
COME ON, CRAIG.
GET IN ON THIS WASTE OF TIME.

21:06.596 --> 21:07.937
NAH, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

21:07.937 --> 21:09.999
CRAIG.
COME ON.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.671
Come on, say a fish.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.303
CRAIG, YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.445
JUST SAY A FISH.
You know you want to, Craig!

21:15.445 --> 21:17.377
Come on, Craig!
Say a fish.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.778
COME ON, CRAIG!
THAT'S AN ORDER!
You know you want to.
Name a fish.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.510
Do it!

21:20.510 --> 21:21.851
DOLPHIN!

21:21.851 --> 21:22.952
YEAH!
Yeah!

21:22.952 --> 21:25.585
(laughs)

21:25.585 --> 21:26.556
DOLPHIN'S NOT A FISH.

21:26.556 --> 21:32.422
IT'S A MAMMAL.
YOU LOSE.
