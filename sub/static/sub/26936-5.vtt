NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.836 --> 00:06.381
Maybe today
we'll find the one thing.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.340
I think we're right on target
for that tunnel.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.426
TERRY:
Keep your eyes peeled, guys.

00:10.426 --> 00:12.721
-(beeping)
-GARY: Sweet.
-What is that?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.724
We found a copy
of the Cremona Document.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.393
That document will lead us
to a Templar voyage

00:19.393 --> 00:21.521
to the new world,
including Oak Island.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.231
MARTY: We have the first
 evidence the French were here.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.859
-TERRY: Whoa!
-CHARLES: What do you got?

00:25.859 --> 00:29.111
I think you hit the tunnel
from Shaft Six.

00:31.405 --> 00:35.076
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:35.076 --> 00:38.412
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.412 --> 00:41.082
for more than 200 years.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.918
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.918 --> 00:47.713
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.713 --> 00:50.424
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.424 --> 00:54.262
and a lead cross
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.262 --> 00:56.765
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.725
To date, six men have died

00:59.725 --> 01:01.310
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.310 --> 01:04.397
And, according to legend,

01:04.397 --> 01:07.567
one more will have to die

01:07.567 --> 01:11.153
before the treasure
can be found.

NARRATOR: For brothers Rick
 and Marty Lagina

01:29.004 --> 01:30.799
and members of their team,

01:30.799 --> 01:35.969
the keys to solving the
223-year-old Oak Island mystery

01:35.969 --> 01:37.805
may be closer than ever.

01:37.805 --> 01:43.019
Hey, Mike,
we're going to go with HI-4.

01:43.019 --> 01:46.522
Not looking for much
of anything till

01:46.522 --> 01:48.441
-at least 90 feet.
-Sounds good.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.317
From then on,
we'll start firming up,

01:50.317 --> 01:52.486
making sure
we're getting good samples.

01:52.486 --> 01:54.781
-Okay.
-The key-- looking for a tunnel

01:54.781 --> 01:56.365
at the 100-foot level,
maybe a little deeper.

01:56.365 --> 01:58.325
Okay. Sounds good.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.662
-Okay.
-All right.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.665
NARRATOR: In recent weeks,
 an ambitious seismic survey

02:03.665 --> 02:05.959
of the island
has revealed a number

02:05.959 --> 02:08.127
of possible underground voids.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.503
Voids which may be connected

02:10.503 --> 02:12.799
to the original
Oak Island treasure shaft,

02:12.799 --> 02:16.134
discovered in 1795.

02:16.134 --> 02:17.679
There's your wood!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.681
NARRATOR:
 So far, the seismic results

02:19.681 --> 02:22.182
have guided the team
to the remains

02:22.182 --> 02:25.520
of a possible tunnel
at a depth of 93 feet,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.021
along with evidence
of human activity

02:28.021 --> 02:32.026
some 170 feet deep underground.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.820
Somebody's hit these things
with an axe. You can see it.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.490
NARRATOR: Today,
 the team has begun drilling

02:37.490 --> 02:43.329
a new exploratory borehole
in an area known as HI-4,

02:43.329 --> 02:46.415
where seismic imaging detected
a possible network of tunnels

02:46.415 --> 02:49.168
at a depth of 100 feet.

02:49.168 --> 02:54.382
We've got two well locations
that hit wood

02:54.382 --> 02:56.341
that, to me, look like tunnels,

02:56.341 --> 02:58.677
-because of the amount
you found.
-Right.

02:58.677 --> 03:00.388
So, if these are the shafts,

03:00.388 --> 03:04.391
then that's the direction
the tunnel would go. HI-4.

03:04.391 --> 03:05.475
TERRY: Yeah,
and that's, in general,

03:05.475 --> 03:07.145
where conventional wisdom

03:07.145 --> 03:09.146
-indicates
that the Money Pit was.
-Right. Right.

03:09.146 --> 03:12.358
-Okay.
-So, we'll see.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.401
NARRATOR:
 It was while excavating

03:14.401 --> 03:16.528
in this same area last year

03:16.528 --> 03:19.240
that the team encountered
an object they believed

03:19.240 --> 03:21.408
to be
the so-called Chappell Vault

03:21.408 --> 03:24.579
at a depth of some 170 feet.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.872
(mechanical whirring, clanging)

03:26.872 --> 03:31.669
It feels like I'm on a whole
bunch of wood at once now.

03:31.669 --> 03:34.463
NARRATOR: The vault,
 which was first discovered

03:34.463 --> 03:37.591
by treasure hunters William
Chappell and Frederick Blair

03:37.591 --> 03:41.429
in 1897,
was estimated to be a large,

03:41.429 --> 03:43.973
seven-foot-tall
wooden structure.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.058
After drilling through it,

03:46.058 --> 03:50.021
the drill bit revealed
evidence of gold,

03:50.021 --> 03:53.942
as well as a small piece of
parchment with writing on it.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.611
Unfortunately, when Chappell
and Blair attempted

03:57.611 --> 03:59.572
to excavate the vault,

03:59.572 --> 04:03.241
the tunnel
they had dug filled with water

04:03.241 --> 04:05.870
and collapsed.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.915
Last year,
after once again locating

04:09.915 --> 04:12.335
what Rick, Marty
and Craig Tester believed

04:12.335 --> 04:14.127
to be the Chappell Vault,

04:14.127 --> 04:17.507
the 60-inch-wide drilling
caisson they were using

04:17.507 --> 04:20.468
seemed to have pushed
the elusive structure lower

04:20.468 --> 04:23.303
and lower into the soft,
muddy ground

04:23.303 --> 04:26.807
and off to the side.

04:26.807 --> 04:28.810
We have to exploit this find.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.937
We have to, um,

04:30.937 --> 04:34.064
you know, find out
the orientation of the tunnel,

04:34.064 --> 04:37.651
because it's certainly
in close proximity to H-8.

04:37.651 --> 04:40.779
And if we model it,
and it turns out

04:40.779 --> 04:45.492
that it's somewhere in
association with the Money Pit,

04:45.492 --> 04:46.995
then we're onto something.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.788
(mechanical whirring)

04:49.788 --> 04:52.165
CRAIG:
It'd be great if we hit wood,

04:52.165 --> 04:54.502
you know, 100 feet or something.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.504
I would like it. Then we're
look... then we're looking

04:56.504 --> 04:58.673
-for that break for that tunnel.
-Yeah.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.259
We should be drilling
good and straight.

05:04.302 --> 05:06.346
NARRATOR:
 As the drilling operation

05:06.346 --> 05:08.391
at the Money Pit continues...

05:08.391 --> 05:11.351
(Skype ringing)

05:11.351 --> 05:13.353
-Hey, Marty.
-Hey, guys.

05:13.353 --> 05:16.064
NARRATOR: ...Craig Tester
 joins Rick Lagina

05:16.064 --> 05:17.649
and other members
of the Oak Island team

05:17.649 --> 05:20.485
in the war room.

05:20.485 --> 05:23.197
So, big brother, how'd your trip
to New York go? Tell me.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.615
I'll tell you in one word.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.701
-I was stunned.
-Wow.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.704
NARRATOR: One week ago,
Rick received the shocking news

05:30.704 --> 05:32.581
that his close friend,

05:32.581 --> 05:35.209
researcher and author
Zena Halpern,

05:35.209 --> 05:37.502
had passed away.

05:37.502 --> 05:40.548
Rick also learned that Zena had
bequeathed to him

05:40.548 --> 05:42.716
the results of her life's work,

05:42.716 --> 05:45.720
including a vast trove of books
and documents

05:45.720 --> 05:48.389
which seemed to connect
the Oak Island mystery

05:48.389 --> 05:50.850
to activities
involving the Knights Templar

05:50.850 --> 05:53.685
as far back as
the 12th century.

05:53.685 --> 05:57.230
I'm just so thrilled to know
that her life's work

05:57.230 --> 05:59.233
isn't just gonna stop
right now.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.235
I guarantee you it's not gonna
stop, Davin, Jason.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.153
It's not gonna stop.

06:03.153 --> 06:05.740
She wouldn't allow it to stop,
and we won't either.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.908
Thank you, brother.

06:07.908 --> 06:11.579
The amount of material
that Zena has wrought...

06:11.579 --> 06:13.247
The width and breadth

06:13.247 --> 06:15.083
of the lady's accomplishments
and research...

06:15.083 --> 06:17.668
It was stunning.
That is the word, stunning.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.420
Is it tied to Oak Island?

06:20.420 --> 06:22.089
I think we all have a...

06:22.089 --> 06:24.591
just a very rudimentary
understanding

06:24.591 --> 06:26.427
of the work
as it relates to Oak Island.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.639
The information is
somewhat disjointed.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.682
Do you have the information
with you? You have it all?

06:31.682 --> 06:33.935
I have some of it,
but there was so much

06:33.935 --> 06:38.064
that we have to have it shipped.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.441
The information will all come
to Oak Island.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.401
So one of the things
that was found

06:42.401 --> 06:47.781
is a, uh, actual copy
of the Cremona Document.

06:49.574 --> 06:55.288
And it's a deposition
by this English Templar knight.

06:55.288 --> 06:57.457
It's a description
of a year-long voyage

06:57.457 --> 07:01.170
to the New World,
wha-what's called Onteora.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.466
I know what this is.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.970
This is at the core
of your mother's research.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.473
NARRATOR: While packing up
 Zena's collection of research,

07:12.473 --> 07:14.141
Rick discovered a copy

07:14.141 --> 07:16.601
of what is known as
the "Cremona Document,"

07:16.601 --> 07:19.646
a collection of maps
and journal passages

07:19.646 --> 07:22.817
reportedly authored by
the 12th-century Templar knight

07:22.817 --> 07:24.985
Ralph de Sudeley.

07:24.985 --> 07:27.822
It describes not only
de Sudeley's journey

07:27.822 --> 07:30.158
to the Temple Mount
in Jerusalem,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.992
where he claimed
to have recovered

07:31.992 --> 07:33.827
priceless religious treasures

07:33.827 --> 07:36.079
including the Ark
of the Covenant,

07:36.079 --> 07:41.627
but also a Templar voyage to
the New World in the year 1178,

07:41.627 --> 07:44.838
more than three centuries
before Christopher Columbus

07:44.838 --> 07:48.800
made landfall in North America.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.221
I don't know if this is
100% accurate, I don't.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.514
Right.

07:54.514 --> 07:57.058
I do believe with 100% certainty

07:57.058 --> 07:59.562
that it's worth
some commitment of ours

07:59.562 --> 08:02.355
to try to come to
an understanding

08:02.355 --> 08:03.690
of whether not only
is this relevant,

08:03.690 --> 08:04.901
but is it accurate?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.528
Here's my thought.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.531
We've now come into possession
of some remarkable research,

08:10.531 --> 08:13.492
a lifetime's worth of research,
literally.

08:13.492 --> 08:19.497
And to that end, I propose that
we establish a research center.

08:19.497 --> 08:24.086
A place where we can gather the
information regarding our work,

08:24.086 --> 08:27.380
our pursuit of answers
for the Oak Island mystery,

08:27.380 --> 08:29.382
and commit ourselves
to that endeavor.

08:29.382 --> 08:31.552
I want to carry her work
forward, I do.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.556
Once Zena's research is here
and housed here,

08:35.556 --> 08:38.350
it will foster this sense
that the information hunt

08:38.350 --> 08:40.311
is, indeed, important.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.398
I believe there's a lot more
to glean from her research,

08:44.398 --> 08:47.525
and who knows where
those paths lead us?

08:47.525 --> 08:51.279
I think the future of that
research, Zena's legacy,

08:51.279 --> 08:53.950
if you will, is in very good
hands on Oak Island.

08:53.950 --> 08:59.871
Yeah, it sounds to me like the
research center idea is timely

08:59.871 --> 09:02.250
because, you know, it's going
to take some real digging

09:02.250 --> 09:03.793
to mess with this.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.211
So, keep going, keep digging
is all I can say,

09:06.211 --> 09:09.590
and see what's... try and
separate out fact from fiction.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.884
I'm gonna make certain
that we follow up on this.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.177
-Good job, you guys.
-All right.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.427
-See you later.
-See ya.

09:14.427 --> 09:21.309
MARTY:
 Talk to you later. Bye.

09:21.309 --> 09:22.769
CHARLES:
What hole are we on?

09:22.769 --> 09:25.648
-TERRY: HI-4.
-CHARLES: HI-4? Okay.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.775
NARRATOR: Following their
 meeting in the war room,

09:28.775 --> 09:31.445
Craig Tester
and Charles Barkhouse

09:31.445 --> 09:35.448
return to the Money Pit area to
check on the drilling progress

09:35.448 --> 09:37.368
of Borehole HI-4,

09:37.368 --> 09:41.621
a location where recent
seismic scanning indicates

09:41.621 --> 09:46.085
a man-made tunnel might exist
some 100 feet below.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.921
-This is 118?
-Yeah.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.841
NARRATOR: As the sonic rig
 advances the drill bar

09:51.841 --> 09:53.967
deeper into the ground,

09:53.967 --> 09:55.970
a specialized coring barrel
on the end

09:55.970 --> 09:58.389
will extract samples of earth,

09:58.389 --> 10:02.475
and any objects or evidence,
in intervals of up to ten feet.

10:02.475 --> 10:04.519
TERRY:
All right, here we go.

10:04.519 --> 10:06.522
We're casing to 118 right now.

10:06.522 --> 10:10.900
-What's on the table is
109 to 118.
-Okay.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.820
NARRATOR:
 These samples

10:12.820 --> 10:15.030
will then be carefully examined
by the team

10:15.030 --> 10:17.073
for any evidence of the tunnel,

10:17.073 --> 10:19.493
and hopefully,
any important artifacts

10:19.493 --> 10:22.203
or treasure they might contain.

10:22.203 --> 10:25.499
So, let's-let's look at this
with much interest.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.500
Keep your eyes peeled, guys.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.173
CHARLES:
It's just thick, eh? Solid.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.594
Uh-oh, that's wood.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.182
Is that horizontal?

10:42.182 --> 10:44.184
-A little bit of an angle.
-CHARLES: You know,
it came this way, so...

10:44.184 --> 10:46.812
-That's 45-ish.
-Yeah, it's coming in
a little bit

10:46.812 --> 10:48.855
-of an angle, but, you know,
it could have been a...
-It's coming in-- Yeah,

10:48.855 --> 10:50.066
-could have been...
-Could have been
a collapsed board.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.817
Yeah.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.195
TERRY: Flip that over.
That's a very flat surface.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.782
-That's the edge of your timber.
-Yeah.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.951
I think we're right on target
for-for that tunnel.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.245
I think we're right
in the general area.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.539
I really think we're in
in situ material.

11:06.539 --> 11:10.919
NARRATOR: The presence
 of undisturbed or in situ soil

11:10.919 --> 11:13.547
means that the wood
the team has found

11:13.547 --> 11:17.759
is likely from a centuries-old,
man-made structure.

11:17.759 --> 11:20.428
Could it be one
of the infamous flood tunnels

11:20.428 --> 11:23.765
designed to protect
a priceless treasure?

11:23.765 --> 11:28.854
Or might it be a tunnel that
leads to the treasure itself?

11:28.854 --> 11:33.567
You guys got your own
personal swamp going on here.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.236
-Yes.
-Hey, Rick.

11:36.236 --> 11:37.404
Where we at?

11:37.404 --> 11:39.948
CRAIG:
109 to 118.

11:39.948 --> 11:43.369
I don't know. Looks like a--
looks like a cut piece here.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.746
And what's interesting
about this, that was

11:46.746 --> 11:49.417
-almost horizontal.
-CRAIG: Charles,

11:49.417 --> 11:51.418
what do you think about finding
wood at this depth?

11:51.418 --> 11:53.461
We could, possibly--

11:53.461 --> 11:56.631
just possibly--
be in your debris field.

11:56.631 --> 12:01.470
The tunnel going from Shaft Six
to the Money Pit.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.849
NARRATOR: A tunnel leading
 to the Money Pit?

12:04.849 --> 12:07.684
In 1861,

12:07.684 --> 12:10.104
a team of treasure hunters
attempted to reach the bottom

12:10.104 --> 12:13.941
of the original Money Pit
and avoid the flood tunnels

12:13.941 --> 12:15.775
by digging an adjacent shaft

12:15.775 --> 12:19.279
down to a depth of 118 feet.

12:19.279 --> 12:23.951
From there, they began
tunneling some 18 feet east

12:23.951 --> 12:26.787
in the hopes of entering
from underneath the floor

12:26.787 --> 12:29.623
of the suspected
treasure chamber.

12:29.623 --> 12:33.335
Unfortunately,
as the team dug closer,

12:33.335 --> 12:37.380
the tunnel, known as Shaft Six,
started flooding

12:37.380 --> 12:40.551
with seawater,
halting their efforts.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.636
Just days later,
workers reported

12:43.636 --> 12:46.097
hearing a series
of horribly loud crashes below,

12:46.097 --> 12:50.311
leading to speculation that
the Money Pit had collapsed,

12:50.311 --> 12:53.980
scattering tons of lumber
and possible treasure

12:53.980 --> 12:57.650
across a deep,
flooded debris field.

12:57.650 --> 13:00.403
Shaft Six,
at the time they dug it,

13:00.403 --> 13:03.490
they knew exactly where
the original Money Pit was.

13:03.490 --> 13:07.495
If we can find the tunnel,
we can track it back

13:07.495 --> 13:08.662
to the original location
of the Money Pit,

13:08.662 --> 13:10.498
and there you are.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.708
If it is Shaft Six,
it's been long sought.

13:13.708 --> 13:19.173
Records show 118
would be the bottom of it.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.673
-Yeah, we just don't know where.
-RICK: Well, it depends.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.509
-Depends on which end you're at.
-Yeah, exactly.

13:22.509 --> 13:24.177
'Cause that thing was
18 feet long.

13:24.177 --> 13:27.181
But if it's clear,
and you really knew it was Six,

13:27.181 --> 13:29.557
and then you knew
which end you were at,

13:29.557 --> 13:31.851
and then you could infer
where the Money Pit was...

13:31.851 --> 13:33.895
Yeah.

13:33.895 --> 13:37.524
NARRATOR: Because the location
 of Shaft Six has been lost

13:37.524 --> 13:41.778
for over a century, finding
what appears to be evidence

13:41.778 --> 13:45.115
of an old searcher tunnel could
be an exciting breakthrough.

13:45.115 --> 13:49.077
If the Oak Island team can
determine which part

13:49.077 --> 13:50.788
of the shaft they have
discovered,

13:50.788 --> 13:53.624
it could help them pinpoint
the exact position

13:53.624 --> 13:55.459
of the original Money Pit.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.254
(drill whining, creaking)

13:59.672 --> 14:02.258
RICK:
If this is Six,

14:02.258 --> 14:03.926
something's gonna come up
in that core.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.389
CRAIG:
Okay, here it comes.

14:10.724 --> 14:13.226
TERRY:
Think that was pushed down?

14:13.226 --> 14:14.727
-Nothing big?
-No.

14:14.727 --> 14:18.731
There's wood right here.
Look at there.

14:18.731 --> 14:21.818
Yeah, that's a little...
interesting.

14:21.818 --> 14:26.115
That's the floor of the tunnel,
right there.

14:26.115 --> 14:31.412
Now, that ties pretty good
with Shaft Six and its tunnel.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.288
What does that tell us to do?

14:33.288 --> 14:36.125
Move over and try
to track that further,

14:36.125 --> 14:38.335
see if that's a shaft or not?

14:38.335 --> 14:39.794
Yeah, I agree.

14:39.794 --> 14:42.590
TERRY: So, yeah,
what are we at right now?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.301
-So, we're at 128.
-128-ish.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.094
Yeah, there's no point
in going deeper.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.803
No.

14:48.803 --> 14:52.807
NARRATOR: Having reached
 a depth of 128 feet,

14:52.807 --> 14:55.769
some ten feet below
the bottom of Shaft Six,

14:55.769 --> 14:59.105
the Oak Island team
sees little purpose

14:59.105 --> 15:01.859
in continuing to dig
Borehole HI-4.

15:01.859 --> 15:07.072
Instead, they will choose
another drill site in an effort

15:07.072 --> 15:09.950
to find the elusive
19th-century searcher shaft

15:09.950 --> 15:14.455
and the tunnel that should lead
them to the original Money Pit.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.289
There's enough intriguing
information here

15:16.289 --> 15:18.792
that lends itself, I think...

15:18.792 --> 15:20.793
Wh-When we come back at this,

15:20.793 --> 15:24.173
we have to continue to explore
this possibility.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.634
-Yep, absolutely.
-Perfect. Thanks, guys.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.636
-Yep. Take care.
-See ya.
-See ya, Rick.

15:36.476 --> 15:40.105
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
 on Oak Island...

15:40.105 --> 15:43.817
MARTY: Rick, I believe your
 research center is here.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.528
NARRATOR: ...Rick, Marty
 and members of the team

15:46.528 --> 15:50.115
welcome the arrival
of a very timely addition

15:50.115 --> 15:51.325
to the island.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.034
DAVE:
Oh, look at that.

15:53.034 --> 15:54.536
Wow.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.871
NARRATOR:
 Irving Equipment, Limited,

15:56.871 --> 15:59.707
the company which,
for the past three years,

15:59.707 --> 16:02.543
has become a valuable partner
in nearly all of the team's

16:02.543 --> 16:04.296
major excavations,

16:04.296 --> 16:06.506
has helped arrange
for one of its affiliates--

16:06.506 --> 16:08.634
Kent Homes--

16:08.634 --> 16:10.927
to temporarily donate
one of their prefabricated

16:10.927 --> 16:14.014
residential dwellings
to the island.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.892
It will serve not only
as a library

16:16.892 --> 16:19.019
to house the records
of Zena Halpern,

16:19.019 --> 16:21.522
but also as a research center,

16:21.522 --> 16:24.191
where people interested
in Oak Island and its history

16:24.191 --> 16:26.275
can come and work.

16:26.275 --> 16:29.028
I'm very grateful myself.

16:29.028 --> 16:32.865
I think that Oak Island is
a very special place,

16:32.865 --> 16:34.576
and as part of that,
we welcome Irving

16:34.576 --> 16:38.205
as part of the Oak Island story.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.873
Well, thank you very much
for the-the opportunity

16:39.873 --> 16:41.792
to-to be a part of this.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.586
Anything we can do on our end,
we'll gladly help support you

16:44.586 --> 16:46.879
-on that from our side.
-Great. Fantastic.

16:48.881 --> 16:50.717
Let's have a look.

16:50.717 --> 16:54.429
MARTY:
Very nice.

16:54.429 --> 16:58.100
-In fact, really nice.
-Yup.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.227
It'll be nicer when there's
computers, maps,

17:01.227 --> 17:05.065
conference tables,
monitors.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.316
I've always espoused the belief
that we need

17:06.316 --> 17:07.608
a proper research center.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.403
If we all really want answers

17:10.403 --> 17:13.323
to the mystery, then we need to

17:13.323 --> 17:15.284
have a place where
real research can be done.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.242
The deal is you've got
to look to the past

17:17.242 --> 17:20.954
to move the...
to move the search forward.

17:20.954 --> 17:23.125
All it would take is
one little discovery

17:23.125 --> 17:24.916
and one little,
obscure piece of paper

17:24.916 --> 17:27.086
-to turn everything,
make it all worth it.
-Exactly.

17:27.086 --> 17:29.131
RICK:
 It's a great start

17:29.131 --> 17:30.590
for what
we're trying to achieve.

17:30.590 --> 17:33.509
CHARLES:
 I agree.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.519
Rick Lagina and Charles
Barkhouse are joined

17:42.519 --> 17:44.605
by fellow Oak Island
enthusiasts

17:44.605 --> 17:47.900
Doug Crowell and Paul Troutman.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.109
Wow, I see Doug's already
got it set up.

17:50.109 --> 17:51.612
Yeah.
(laughs)

17:51.612 --> 17:53.238
NARRATOR:
 They have come to help unpack

17:53.238 --> 17:55.199
the vast collection
of research materials,

17:55.199 --> 17:58.285
most of which Rick
has recently inherited

17:58.285 --> 18:00.496
from his late friend,
Zena Halpern.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.913
Look at that.

18:01.913 --> 18:06.542
It's all... annotated.
You know, notes.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.211
It's incredible.

18:08.211 --> 18:10.506
RICK: One of the greatest things
 about Oak Island

18:10.506 --> 18:14.384
is you meet interesting,
wonderful,

18:14.384 --> 18:16.220
captivating people.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.640
And this commitment, this
passion, this desire to learn,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.057
it changed Zena's life.

18:21.057 --> 18:23.602
PAUL:
Yeah, she added notes

18:23.602 --> 18:25.269
on top of
what was currently there.

18:25.269 --> 18:27.021
Notes on top of notes.

18:27.021 --> 18:29.650
We'll have to see how it ties in
more with Oak Island.

18:31.567 --> 18:34.403
NARRATOR: As work on the new
 research center progresses,

18:34.403 --> 18:37.657
Jack Begley, Peter Fornetti

18:37.657 --> 18:41.662
and metal-detection expert
Gary Drayton head to Lot 21,

18:41.662 --> 18:44.539
located on the western side
of the island.

18:44.539 --> 18:46.040
GARY: So, we should be able
to bring back

18:46.040 --> 18:47.375
a ton of stuff from here.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.336
-PETER: Let's get to it.
-GARY: Yep.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.587
NARRATOR: It was while searching
 this same lot

18:51.587 --> 18:54.215
just three weeks ago

18:54.215 --> 18:56.259
that Gary,
along with Rick Lagina,

18:56.259 --> 18:57.760
made one of the team's

18:57.760 --> 18:59.471
most astonishing discoveries
to date.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.807
GARY:
Oh, my gosh.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.852
It's another bobby-dazzler!
Look.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.478
NARRATOR:
 A gold-plated brooch,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.605
which was later
determined to be

19:08.605 --> 19:11.400
as much as 700 years old.

19:17.530 --> 19:20.701
GARY: I'm trying to winkle
a good target out.

19:23.077 --> 19:25.873
(metal detector whines)

19:25.873 --> 19:27.499
(beeping)

19:27.499 --> 19:29.667
That is what a button
or a coin would sound like.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.669
(whining)

19:30.669 --> 19:32.628
Just in here, mate.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.974
(beeping)

19:47.269 --> 19:49.520
GARY:
Come on, be something good.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.898
JACK: Baby,
give me something good.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.986
(beeping)

19:55.986 --> 19:57.820
It's out, whatever it is.

19:57.820 --> 19:59.698
-(beeping)
-JACK: What is that?

20:01.657 --> 20:05.162
-That's got some designs on it.
-GARY: Yeah, that has.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.872
Oh, that's cool.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.415
GARY: You know what this
reminds me of?

20:09.415 --> 20:13.002
This reminds me of, like, a cap
badge, a military cap badge.

20:13.002 --> 20:16.339
This would have been
a decoration on a cap.

20:16.339 --> 20:19.050
It would have been on the front,

20:19.050 --> 20:21.385
and that's
a top-pocket find, mate.

20:21.385 --> 20:23.471
In we go.

20:23.471 --> 20:25.222
All right.

20:25.222 --> 20:27.351
And we'll see if there's
any more parts to it.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.478
(sensor whirring, beeping)

20:31.688 --> 20:33.690
GARY: We got another signal
in the top.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.567
-JACK: Oh, awesome.
-Be a little bit more gentle

20:35.567 --> 20:37.611
with this one, this time.

20:37.611 --> 20:41.030
I'm hoping it's more
of the same.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.615
(beeping)

20:48.829 --> 20:50.499
-Ooh, it is.
-It is.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.125
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-Oh, man, look at that.

20:53.125 --> 20:56.421
I-I could, before I moved it,
I could see the fleur-de-lis.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.089
This is...

20:58.089 --> 21:00.299
That is definitely...

21:00.299 --> 21:02.426
Let's see if it fits on there.

21:02.426 --> 21:04.261
-JACK: It does.
-PETER: Perfect.

21:04.261 --> 21:07.723
GARY:
It's definitely a fit.

21:07.723 --> 21:09.809
Like a glove.

21:09.809 --> 21:12.479
Wow, look at that design
on there.

21:12.479 --> 21:16.857
They look like fleur-de-lis,
or very, very similar.

21:16.857 --> 21:19.027
-That's a French design.
-JACK: French?

21:19.027 --> 21:21.529
This would date to the 1700s.

21:21.529 --> 21:23.365
NARRATOR:
 A badge?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.909
And possibly from the cap
of an 18th-century

21:25.909 --> 21:28.286
French military
officer's uniform?

21:28.286 --> 21:32.124
But if so, what is it doing
on Oak Island?

21:32.124 --> 21:35.126
And could it have some
connection to the gold brooch

21:35.126 --> 21:38.922
discovered in this same area
earlier this year?

21:38.922 --> 21:42.425
-French military, baby.
-JACK: (chuckles) Yeah.

21:42.425 --> 21:45.636
But what was they either
putting here or searching for?

21:45.636 --> 21:47.305
Or protecting.

21:47.305 --> 21:50.933
GARY: Definitely
 a top-pocket find, guys.

21:53.394 --> 21:55.521
NARRATOR:
 Later that same day...

21:57.857 --> 22:01.193
...Rick and Charles,
along with Craig Tester

22:01.193 --> 22:04.448
and Dave Blankenship, head over
to the Money Pit site,

22:04.448 --> 22:07.576
where the team from Choice
Drilling has already begun

22:07.576 --> 22:13.248
coring a new borehole,
known as IJ-5.5,

22:13.248 --> 22:16.292
an area chosen
due to its close proximity

22:16.292 --> 22:20.963
to GAL-1, one of the team's
most promising shafts to date.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.799
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

22:23.799 --> 22:25.551
RICK: I am absolutely interested
 in drilling

22:25.551 --> 22:27.636
this position called IJ-5.5,

22:27.636 --> 22:30.515
in search of
the long sought after tunnel

22:30.515 --> 22:32.183
between Shaft Six
and the Money Pit.

22:32.183 --> 22:34.560
After that collapse, in 1861,

22:34.560 --> 22:36.771
the Money Pit location
was lost,

22:36.771 --> 22:39.106
and ever since then,
there's only been a guess.

22:39.106 --> 22:41.984
An educated guess, mind you,
but if we can find that tunnel,

22:41.984 --> 22:45.029
I think that's the way
to un-corkscrew the Money Pit.

22:45.029 --> 22:47.281
CHARLES:
So, Brennan, we're at 59, right?

22:47.281 --> 22:48.741
BRENNAN:
That's correct, 59.

22:48.741 --> 22:51.702
RICK: The reason why this one
is interesting,

22:51.702 --> 22:54.830
-when we drilled the GAL hole...
-Yep.

22:54.830 --> 22:58.375
...we found, in the spoils,
we find a very old spike,

22:58.375 --> 23:01.337
and we found
a gold-plated button.

23:03.714 --> 23:05.133
MARTY:
That's our spot, right there.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.426
-That's where GAL is.
-GAL number one.

23:07.426 --> 23:10.012
NARRATOR:
 Two years ago, in an effort

23:10.012 --> 23:12.807
to locate the original
Money Pit, the Oak Island team

23:12.807 --> 23:16.353
excavated a 40-inch-wide
exploratory shaft

23:16.353 --> 23:19.815
which was named in honor
of Rick and Marty's parents,

23:19.815 --> 23:24.068
George and Ann Lagina: GAL-1.

23:24.068 --> 23:26.529
We've got a coin!

23:26.529 --> 23:28.906
Honest to God, a coin?
Out of this spoils pile?

23:28.906 --> 23:31.785
NARRATOR: It was while searching
 the spoils from this hole,

23:31.785 --> 23:35.538
which was dug
to a depth of 160 feet,

23:35.538 --> 23:39.041
that the team made a number
of significant discoveries...

23:39.041 --> 23:40.585
GARY:
It says "plated." It's a button.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.336
NARRATOR:
 ...including a gold-plated

23:42.336 --> 23:45.298
18th-century
British military button,

23:45.298 --> 23:48.593
a 300-year-old
iron rosehead spike

23:48.593 --> 23:50.595
and a mysterious metal hinge

23:50.595 --> 23:55.432
believed to have come from some
kind of large box or vault.

23:55.432 --> 24:00.396
RICK: Maybe that was part
of the debris field.

24:00.396 --> 24:02.315
I never thought twice
about it, did you?

24:02.315 --> 24:04.067
No, 'cause we didn't know
where it came from.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.318
Okay.

24:10.156 --> 24:12.992
Maybe today
we'll find the one thing.

24:12.992 --> 24:14.326
-CRAIG: Yeah.
-Yep.

24:15.703 --> 24:18.498
RICK:
 That's the hope.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.670
NARRATOR:
 Early the next day...
If that's French,
then obviously,

24:23.670 --> 24:25.838
as the team
from Choice Drilling

24:25.838 --> 24:31.010
continues the coring operation
at Borehole IJ-5.5...

24:31.010 --> 24:33.680
-CHARLES: Wow.
-RICK: Look at that.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.848
CHARLES:
They're really coming along.

24:35.848 --> 24:37.851
-DAN H.: Yeah.
-Morning.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.685
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina,
 Charles Barkhouse

24:39.685 --> 24:41.520
and Dan Henskee

24:41.520 --> 24:44.356
check on the progress
of the massive steel cofferdam

24:44.356 --> 24:47.777
being constructed
at Smith's Cove.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.528
-Wow.
-Quite impressive.

24:49.528 --> 24:51.072
It's looking good.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.740
RICK: You know, I have
high hopes for that area.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.991
CHARLES:
Yeah.

24:53.991 --> 24:56.536
RICK:
So, bring us up to speed.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.579
How is it going?
Have you encountered, you know,

24:58.579 --> 25:01.208
the problem-- the potential
problem was always wood.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.042
Have you encountered
any of that?

25:03.042 --> 25:06.212
No wood, yet. No.
A little harder tills and clay

25:06.212 --> 25:08.048
we're into now, but no wood.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.423
You can see the profile
of the sheets,

25:09.423 --> 25:11.050
-right where the corner starts.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

25:11.050 --> 25:13.053
COLIN: Where they step up
about a foot or so,

25:13.053 --> 25:15.721
-that's where
the hard tills are.
-Yeah.

25:15.721 --> 25:19.558
NARRATOR: In order to construct
 a cofferdam both wide enough

25:19.558 --> 25:23.313
and deep enough to encircle
most of Smith's Cove,

25:23.313 --> 25:26.691
the team from Irving Equipment,
Limited has employed a process

25:26.691 --> 25:28.734
known as sheet piling,

25:28.734 --> 25:31.738
which uses a powerful hydraulic
hammer to drive

25:31.738 --> 25:37.243
40-foot-long steel sheets up to
25 feet deep into the seabed.

25:37.243 --> 25:41.538
Each of these pilings,
weighing some 5,500 pounds,

25:41.538 --> 25:43.124
will interlock together

25:43.124 --> 25:47.420
to form a 525-foot-long
watertight barrier,

25:47.420 --> 25:49.923
which, when finished,
will allow the Oak Island team

25:49.923 --> 25:52.675
to fully drain
and then excavate

25:52.675 --> 25:56.096
the approximately
12,000-square-foot area.

25:56.096 --> 26:00.224
If successful,
the team may be able to find

26:00.224 --> 26:02.644
not only important
historical artifacts

26:02.644 --> 26:05.521
like the mysterious lead cross,

26:05.521 --> 26:07.106
but also the entrance

26:07.106 --> 26:09.317
to the booby-trapped
flood tunnel system,

26:09.317 --> 26:11.944
which sends ocean water
to the Money Pit area

26:11.944 --> 26:16.240
for the purpose of thwarting
would-be treasure hunters.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.537
How far along
do you think we are?

26:20.537 --> 26:22.247
After today,
we should have about a third

26:22.247 --> 26:24.749
-of the wall completed.
-Good.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.500
RICK:
 I'm buoyed by the fact

26:26.500 --> 26:28.295
that we're going
to accomplish this.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.548
We're going to get Smith's Cove
sealed off watertight

26:31.548 --> 26:33.173
once and for all.

26:33.173 --> 26:36.720
If it were up to me,
I would start yesterday.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.472
The faster this proceeds,
the more answers we will gain,

26:40.472 --> 26:42.851
and, uh, that's the hope.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.478
Colin, can't wait
to see it completed,

26:45.478 --> 26:47.314
and, uh, we can
get our hands dirty.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.231
-Sure.
-Yeah.

26:49.231 --> 26:51.026
RICK: I know you got
a lot of work to do.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.319
The guys are busy, so good luck
the rest of the day.

26:53.319 --> 26:54.778
-Stay safe.
-COLIN: Yes, you, too.

26:54.778 --> 26:56.155
-See you later, guys.
-CHARLES: Thank you.

26:56.155 --> 26:57.406
COLIN:
Take care.

27:00.993 --> 27:02.996
NARRATOR:
 Later that day...

27:02.996 --> 27:04.372
MARTY:
Come on in.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.333
...Marty Lagina, his son Alex

27:06.333 --> 27:09.085
and local archeologist
Laird Niven

27:09.085 --> 27:12.505
arrive for a meeting at the
new Oak Island Research Center.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.423
-Hello, gents.
-GARY: Hey, guys.
-PAUL: Hey, how you doing, guys?

27:14.423 --> 27:16.343
-Hey, guys.
-I got Laird in tow.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.678
NARRATOR: They have been
 invited by Gary Drayton

27:18.678 --> 27:20.680
and researcher Paul Troutman

27:20.680 --> 27:25.684
to inspect Gary's most recent
discoveries on Lot 21.

27:25.684 --> 27:28.480
Gary, I understand you have
some TPFs for us.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.441
-Yep. Top-pocket finds.
-Top-pocket finds.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.942
-GARY: I have.
-You know, I'm always excited

27:32.942 --> 27:35.153
when you say that,
so let's have a look.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.073
Well, first of all, I'll have to
tell you where this came from.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.531
MARTY:
Yep.

27:39.531 --> 27:41.701
Lot 21.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.287
So, I won't tease you
any longer,

27:44.287 --> 27:45.747
and it's in the top pocket.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.289
MARTY:
All right.

27:47.289 --> 27:49.250
GARY:
Check this out.

27:49.250 --> 27:54.005
Both pieces were found
in the same area.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.757
What do you think
of that, Laird?

27:57.217 --> 27:59.219
-LAIRD: Hmm.
-ALEX: Oh, man, look at that.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.845
LAIRD:
Interesting.

28:03.263 --> 28:08.103
GARY: I think what this is
is a cap or a hat decoration,

28:08.103 --> 28:11.647
a military uniform piece.

28:11.647 --> 28:13.900
That's kind of the shape
of a grenadier's hat as well,

28:13.900 --> 28:15.234
-replicating that...
-Yeah. Yeah.

28:15.234 --> 28:16.568
GARY: And the French influence,
as well.

28:16.568 --> 28:17.820
LAIRD:
Yeah. Yeah.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.405
If that's French,
then obviously,

28:19.405 --> 28:21.324
the first thing you think of
is the ship's log

28:21.324 --> 28:24.952
and the Duc D'Anville,
and all of that connection.

28:24.952 --> 28:29.749
I found eight pages of a ship,
what looks like a ship's log.

28:29.749 --> 28:33.086
NARRATOR: Last year, Oak Island
 researcher Doug Crowell

28:33.086 --> 28:35.171
presented the team
with information

28:35.171 --> 28:37.757
taken from
a centuries-old ship's log.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.509
In it was the detailed account

28:40.509 --> 28:44.180
of a failed French
naval expedition in 1746

28:44.180 --> 28:48.101
led by the Duc D'Anville,
a descendant of a family

28:48.101 --> 28:50.561
connected
to the Knights Templar.

28:50.561 --> 28:53.314
The log also documented
the construction

28:53.314 --> 28:56.817
of what was described
as a deep treasure shaft

28:56.817 --> 28:59.194
dug on a wooded island

28:59.194 --> 29:03.282
and then filled with millions
in gold and precious jewels.

29:03.282 --> 29:06.452
"It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug,

29:06.452 --> 29:08.078
"the pit to have a secret
entrance by a tunnel

29:08.078 --> 29:09.538
from the shore."

29:09.538 --> 29:10.957
CRAIG: I mean, a great quantity
of treasure,

29:10.957 --> 29:14.836
and that they appear
to be in this bay.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.422
What troubles me
is how perfect this is.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.840
Interestingly enough,
the Duc D'Anville,

29:19.840 --> 29:25.971
his real name was Jean-Baptiste
Louis Frédéric de Rochefoucauld.

29:25.971 --> 29:29.851
NARRATOR: Could this French
 military badge,

29:29.851 --> 29:32.644
which Gary believes dates back
to the 1700s,

29:32.644 --> 29:34.480
be physical evidence

29:34.480 --> 29:38.276
that the Duc D'Anville
actually came to Oak Island?

29:38.276 --> 29:40.694
The same Duc D'Anville

29:40.694 --> 29:43.823
whose ancestors were believed
by Zena Halpern

29:43.823 --> 29:47.826
to be key players in the Oak
Island treasure mystery?

29:47.826 --> 29:50.913
Is that the only potential
French thing

29:50.913 --> 29:52.957
we've found on the island?

29:52.957 --> 29:54.584
-It is for me.
-Yeah.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.085
As far as I know.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.378
MARTY: Every time you find
something, Gary,

29:58.378 --> 30:01.298
-it expands the possibilities,
not shrinks them.
-Yes.

30:01.298 --> 30:03.800
-More questions than answers.
-(laughter)

30:03.800 --> 30:06.179
Good. Let's see
where the trail leads us.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.555
GARY:
I need some bigger top pockets.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.557
(laughter)

30:12.684 --> 30:15.896
NARRATOR: As the drilling
 of Borehole IJ-5.5 continues

30:15.896 --> 30:17.356
at the Money Pit...

30:17.356 --> 30:18.857
RANDALL (over phone):
 Hello?

30:18.857 --> 30:20.859
-MARTY: Hello, Randall?
-RANDALL: Yeah.

30:20.859 --> 30:25.030
...Marty and Rick Lagina take
a phone call in the war room.

30:25.030 --> 30:27.032
Yeah, you got Marty and Rick.

30:27.032 --> 30:29.826
-How are you?
-Good to hear your guys' voices.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.371
NARRATOR:
 For nearly two decades,

30:31.371 --> 30:33.914
acclaimed author
Randall Sullivan

30:33.914 --> 30:36.375
has been investigating
and writing

30:36.375 --> 30:38.711
about the Oak Island mystery.

30:38.711 --> 30:42.382
Two years ago, he paid
a special visit to the island

30:42.382 --> 30:45.009
in order to conduct research
on a book...

30:45.009 --> 30:48.680
Just imagine if the ghosts of
the 19th century could see this.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.099
...one which, he intends,
will be the most comprehensive

30:52.099 --> 30:54.143
and authoritative ever written

30:54.143 --> 30:57.271
about the 223-year-old
treasure hunt.

30:57.271 --> 30:59.941
RANDALL:
It astonished me how many people

30:59.941 --> 31:02.902
didn't know about the story, and
were completely entranced by it,

31:02.902 --> 31:04.570
and the story
just didn't go away,

31:04.570 --> 31:06.489
'cause the mystery has
not gone away.

31:06.489 --> 31:09.032
And that's actually what engages
me, in terms of writing a book.

31:09.032 --> 31:13.788
It's the story, and the mystery
of it that is really compelling.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.080
Well, you two share that.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.959
RICK:
So, what can we do for you?

31:31.513 --> 31:34.308
I'll say this: they're probably
the most puzzling finds.

31:34.308 --> 31:35.852
That's for sure.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.311
The most significant ones,
Randall,

31:37.311 --> 31:39.605
we think, are the, uh,
the human bones.

31:39.605 --> 31:41.816
I mean,
even for a skeptic like me,

31:41.816 --> 31:44.109
it's just hard to come up
with a plausible reason

31:44.109 --> 31:46.653
that those things
were that deep underground.

31:46.653 --> 31:49.531
And then we have that very
strange medieval cross.

31:49.531 --> 31:52.160
-I think those are
the two biggies for the year.
-Absolutely.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.123
Well, there's a good question.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.291
Um, that's why
they're so strange.

31:59.291 --> 32:01.627
No, I don't really see
a connection between those two,

32:01.627 --> 32:04.963
other than drawing the obvious
conclusion that something

32:04.963 --> 32:07.924
rather extraordinary
happened here.

32:07.924 --> 32:10.303
It's an island of what-ifs
and possibilities

32:10.303 --> 32:12.638
and it continues to remain so.

32:12.638 --> 32:14.973
You know, your favorite theory
was Francis Bacon.

32:14.973 --> 32:18.227
Are you still there? Have you
uncovered anything more,

32:18.227 --> 32:20.480
that Francis Bacon
has a connection here?

32:40.333 --> 32:41.541
Yeah, isn't that maddening?

32:41.541 --> 32:44.671
(soft laughter)

32:44.671 --> 32:46.673
Uh, I'm looking forward
to reading your book.

32:46.673 --> 32:50.634
I assume we get
an autographed copy, right?

32:54.012 --> 32:55.515
That would be great.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.392
Randall Sullivan's clearly

32:57.392 --> 32:58.851
an Oak Island aficionado.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.686
The fact that he's now
writing a book,

33:00.686 --> 33:02.771
I look-- very much look forward
to reading it.

33:02.771 --> 33:04.773
I've always believed
that the Oak Island story

33:04.773 --> 33:09.528
is quite remarkable,
and I hope he does it justice.

33:09.528 --> 33:12.656
Anyway, Randall, look,
we wish you the very best.

33:12.656 --> 33:14.741
-Absolutely. Take care.
-See you.

33:14.741 --> 33:17.619
MARTY:
 Yeah. Bye.

33:17.619 --> 33:20.580
NARRATOR:
 Later that same day,

33:20.580 --> 33:23.500
Rick Lagina joins Craig Tester,

33:23.500 --> 33:26.045
Dave Blankenship
and Charles Barkhouse

33:26.045 --> 33:28.548
as they head to the Money Pit

33:28.548 --> 33:32.218
to check on the progress
of Borehole IJ-5.5,

33:32.218 --> 33:34.220
a hole which they believe

33:34.220 --> 33:38.598
intersects a 157-year-old
searcher tunnel

33:38.598 --> 33:41.728
known as Shaft Six.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.105
If their assumption is correct,

33:44.105 --> 33:45.897
the team should be able
to locate

33:45.897 --> 33:49.443
not only the original
Money Pit, but also

33:49.443 --> 33:53.823
what they hope is a massive
underground debris field.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.825
How deep are we?

33:55.825 --> 33:57.826
-Oh, we're down about...
-89 feet.

33:57.826 --> 33:58.952
-89 feet.
-Ooh.

33:58.952 --> 34:01.247
RICK:
We're close.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.999
The hope is that
this is the area

34:02.999 --> 34:05.460
where the tunnel
to the Money Pit is.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.377
-TERRY: Mm-hmm.
-The Shaft Six tunnel.

34:07.377 --> 34:09.422
Well, from my perspective,

34:09.422 --> 34:11.922
it's right in ground
that we haven't been in before.

34:11.922 --> 34:13.925
So, if we can stay straight,

34:13.925 --> 34:17.137
we'll hit a target that we
haven't seen in any other hole.

34:17.137 --> 34:18.639
RICK:
There's no question that today,

34:18.639 --> 34:19.849
there's some excitement
in the air,

34:19.849 --> 34:21.768
certainly anticipation.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.603
If there's something
to be found in the Money Pit,

34:24.603 --> 34:27.356
it's in the tunnel
that connects Shaft Six

34:27.356 --> 34:29.775
to the original Money Pit.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.277
And the hope is that

34:32.277 --> 34:33.780
this is indeed the location.

34:33.780 --> 34:37.324
(metal squeaking)

34:37.324 --> 34:39.534
Well, here we go.

34:47.626 --> 34:51.547
-111, Charles.
-111.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.677
Yep. It does.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.809
Oh! That's interesting.

35:03.809 --> 35:05.644
-CHARLES: What do you got?
-Wood, chunk of wood.

35:05.644 --> 35:06.853
CRAIG:
Got wood here, too.

35:06.853 --> 35:08.396
TERRY:
Pretty hard to say...

35:08.396 --> 35:09.981
-Oh, whoa...
-CRAIG: Oh, that's definitely...

35:09.981 --> 35:14.152
-CRAIG: That's a whole piece.
-TERRY: Whoa.

35:14.152 --> 35:16.072
CRAIG: Oh, that's
definitely v piece.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.742
NARRATOR: While drilling
 in Borehole IJ-5.5,

35:19.742 --> 35:22.911
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

35:22.911 --> 35:25.914
have just made a potentially
significant find.

35:25.914 --> 35:27.500
CRAIG:
Is that horizontal, Rick?

35:27.500 --> 35:28.835
Yeah.

35:28.835 --> 35:34.132
I think you hit
the tunnel from Shaft Six.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.467
NARRATOR: They have just
 discovered evidence

35:36.467 --> 35:38.635
of what appears
to be a wooden beam,

35:38.635 --> 35:42.806
found at a depth of 111 feet.

35:42.806 --> 35:45.226
A depth which, according
to historical records,

35:45.226 --> 35:48.353
matches that of Shaft Six,

35:48.353 --> 35:51.398
the 157-year-old
searcher tunnel

35:51.398 --> 35:53.860
that they believe
can lead them directly

35:53.860 --> 35:57.195
to the original Oak Island
Money Pit.

35:57.195 --> 35:59.907
I-I think it's worth
calling Marty.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.324
Craig, do you want to...

36:01.324 --> 36:02.827
-Let's give Marty a call.
-Yeah.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.036
(line ringing)

36:06.746 --> 36:09.500
We think we found
one of the sides of Tunnel Six.

36:09.500 --> 36:15.047
It's now finding the middle, and
is there any gold inside of it?

36:18.175 --> 36:21.596
Uh, Craig would like
to go west, first.

36:21.596 --> 36:26.016
I'm okay with that, but,
I think we need to, obviously,

36:26.016 --> 36:30.478
we need to go east, as well,
to try to define it.

36:30.478 --> 36:33.231
All we have to do
is find one thing.

36:33.231 --> 36:36.235
Then we chase the tunnel,
and there's your Money Pit.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.402
Bingo.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.199
-CRAIG: Okay.
-RICK: All right.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.744
-Sure thing. Talk to you again.
-Yeah. Bye.

36:45.744 --> 36:49.998
RICK: Today was a good day
 on Oak Island, in my opinion.

36:49.998 --> 36:52.210
I do believe we're in a tunnel,
and if we are,

36:52.210 --> 36:56.338
it's been, it's been hard-won,
hard fought.

36:56.338 --> 36:59.675
He's been looking for this
debris field since we started.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.552
So it moves the dial
a little bit.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.639
You find that tunnel,
you'll find the Money Pit.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.891
I really believe this is
the tunnel from Shaft Six.

37:07.891 --> 37:09.434
Now it's just finding out,

37:09.434 --> 37:11.603
did the treasure chest shoot
into this tunnel?

37:11.603 --> 37:14.273
-Yep.
-There's something in Six.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.192
-Let's find it.
-Okay.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.610
-CRAIG: Okay, gentlemen.
-RICK: Thank you.

37:21.655 --> 37:24.492
NARRATOR: After a day
 that saw the Oak Island team

37:24.492 --> 37:26.077
make promising new discoveries

37:26.077 --> 37:28.663
both at the Money Pit
and Lot 21,

37:28.663 --> 37:31.791
Rick Lagina welcomes
a very special visitor

37:31.791 --> 37:33.793
to the island.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.251
Davin, welcome.

37:35.251 --> 37:36.795
-How you doing, buddy?
-How you doing?

37:36.795 --> 37:38.755
NARRATOR:
 Davin Halpern is the son

37:38.755 --> 37:41.925
of late author and researcher
Zena Halpern.

37:41.925 --> 37:44.804
He has come to see the place
where his mother's decades

37:44.804 --> 37:48.682
of research materials
have now found a new home:

37:48.682 --> 37:51.268
the Oak Island Research Center.

37:51.268 --> 37:52.853
-Sit down, please.
-PAUL: Please.
-Thank you.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.981
And we have, uh...
I hope the trip went well.

37:55.981 --> 37:58.567
Yes. Absolutely.

37:58.567 --> 38:01.027
RICK: You know, I mean,
waiting for you to arrive,

38:01.027 --> 38:04.197
you know, Doug was speaking
about your mom.

38:04.197 --> 38:07.242
For us, she's still alive.

38:07.242 --> 38:11.871
She's still within here
and still within here.

38:11.871 --> 38:16.043
And, you know, my life has been
enriched by meeting her.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.586
I'm just really happy
that she's been taken in

38:18.586 --> 38:20.213
as part of this family.

38:20.213 --> 38:23.425
There was something
that she wanted you to have,

38:23.425 --> 38:25.344
and I brought something with me.

38:25.344 --> 38:29.889
So when you visited,
if you remember,

38:29.889 --> 38:33.518
there was this candlestick.

38:34.894 --> 38:38.440
So this was a precious artifact

38:38.440 --> 38:42.695
that my mom brought back
from one of her travels.

38:45.739 --> 38:47.240
Oh, wow.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.411
DAVIN: I don't know
if she was tracing back

38:50.411 --> 38:54.706
to some Hebrew relative
of hers...

38:54.706 --> 38:58.418
I can tell you, it's an absolute
honor and a privilege

38:58.418 --> 39:00.628
to bring this, personally,
here and be here.

39:00.628 --> 39:03.590
It's really humbling for me.

39:05.175 --> 39:08.596
I mean, I'm humbled,
stunned, appreciative.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.849
You know, all I can say is...
t-thank you,

39:12.849 --> 39:16.061
because it's-it's a part
of your mom here,

39:16.061 --> 39:19.231
that has now come to reside
on Oak Island.

39:19.231 --> 39:23.485
When we receive something
from a person

39:23.485 --> 39:27.197
that we care about,
it's not about that item.

39:27.197 --> 39:28.990
Memories flood back.

39:28.990 --> 39:31.117
The understanding of

39:31.117 --> 39:32.869
who that person is comes alive.

39:32.869 --> 39:36.581
And in that moment,
I reconnected with her.

39:36.581 --> 39:38.958
Surely, she touched
each and every one of us,

39:38.958 --> 39:41.420
and to that end,
we're very grateful.

39:41.420 --> 39:45.423
DAVIN: I'm so happy to see that
her work is being appreciated,

39:45.423 --> 39:47.842
and it's likely
not going to end with her.

39:47.842 --> 39:50.512
RICK:
I think we all commit to this,

39:50.512 --> 39:52.681
that her research will endure.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.059
It will not end with her.

39:55.059 --> 40:00.063
I know how much she deeply cared
about you and everybody here,

40:00.063 --> 40:03.275
and I know that she's looking
down on this

40:03.275 --> 40:06.487
right now
and she's really happy.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.280
Thank you.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.364
Thank you, Davin.

40:09.364 --> 40:12.534
Appreciate it, bud.

40:12.534 --> 40:14.161
And I will tell you this:

40:14.161 --> 40:17.623
there's but one time this candle
will be lit.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.751
When we have the answers,
because of her work.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.460
Awesome.

40:22.460 --> 40:26.172
And you will be here in this
room when that lights up.

40:26.172 --> 40:29.300
I will commit to that,
absolutely.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.936
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
 and the Oak Island team,

40:39.936 --> 40:42.313
this week, more than any other,

40:42.313 --> 40:45.233
has reminded them of the debt
they owe

40:45.233 --> 40:50.489
to all the hard work done
by those who came before them.

40:50.489 --> 40:54.702
For it is through
countless hours of digging,

40:54.702 --> 40:58.289
as well as years
of fact finding and research,

40:58.289 --> 41:02.168
that the Oak Island story has
been preserved.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.795
And the keys
to a possible breakthrough

41:04.795 --> 41:07.590
may very well exist.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.842
Perhaps not in plain sight,

41:10.842 --> 41:13.971
or even deep underground,

41:13.971 --> 41:18.516
but hidden within books
and manuscripts,

41:18.516 --> 41:22.730
or maybe on a simple piece
of paper,

41:22.730 --> 41:25.565
written in code.

41:28.402 --> 41:31.405
Next time
 on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:31.405 --> 41:33.990
The Jolly Roger was
originally a Templar symbol.

41:33.990 --> 41:36.242
Some of them became pirates.

41:36.242 --> 41:39.329
MARTY: I am very excited
 to see some sort of chamber

41:39.329 --> 41:40.914
-down in the Mega-bin area.
-Could it be wood?

41:40.914 --> 41:42.666
I don't think so.
It's pretty dense.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.791
CRAIG: If there's a plate
 covering up something,

41:43.791 --> 41:45.460
that's gonna be huge.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.045
RICK:
 We have this lead artifact.

41:47.045 --> 41:49.215
Can you actually put
a precise location on it?

41:49.215 --> 41:51.967
I think I got some pretty
interesting results for you.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.219
MARTY:
It is the most historic thing

41:54.219 --> 41:56.931
that's maybe ever happened
in North America.
