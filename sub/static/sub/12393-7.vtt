THOSE THINGS ARE JUST
ANOTHER PASSING FAD

00:25.490 --> 00:27.458
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON SOMETHING

00:27.490 --> 00:29.856

02:31.950 --> 02:34.339
I'M HERE TO SAY ONE
FINAL GOOD-BYE TO LEONARD.

CLOSEST TO HIM...

BY A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.572
BUT WE KNOW DIDDLE
IS IN A BETTER PLACE NOW.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.817
DIDDLE IS IN
A BETTER PLACE NOW.

- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE BEEN
HOLDING OUT ON ME

05:13.110 --> 05:14.407
FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.737
- YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF
MY LIFELONG DREAMS

05:15.780 --> 05:17.600
TO BE PART OF
A FOUR-PIECE SINGING GROUP.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.174
FIVE-PIECE WAS MY BACKUP.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.144
NOW I FIND OUT NOT ONLY
WERE YOU IN ONE,

05:21.180 --> 05:23.080
YOU LET IT ALL SLIP AWAY--
I MUST KNOW WHY, I MUST!

05:23.120 --> 05:24.189
- ENOUGH, SHAWN.
- THAT WAS LIKE

05:24.220 --> 05:25.881
A NEW EDITION REUNION CONCERT

05:25.920 --> 05:27.182
MINUS BOBBY AND RONNIE.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.085
WHAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY
COME BETWEEN MEN

05:29.120 --> 05:33.796
CAPABLE OF CREATING
SUCH SWEET, SWEET HARMONY?

05:33.830 --> 05:35.957
GIMME A HINT.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.467
YOU CAN GIVE ME A BABY HINT.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.467
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.603
MAN, I WISH I COULD HAVE
KNOWN YOU WHEN YOU WERE BLACK.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.777
- YOU'RE THE PSYCHIC, RIGHT?

05:47.810 --> 05:50.643
- YES. UH, SHAWN SPENCER.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.444
- I'M TONY.
THIS IS JOON.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.311
WE READ ABOUT YOURS AND GUS'S
DETECTIVE AGENCY

05:55.350 --> 05:56.908
IN OUR ALUMNI NEWSLETTER.

05:56.950 --> 05:59.111
- OH. WOW.
LOOK, I GO'I'I'A TELL YOU GUYS,

05:59.150 --> 06:01.357
YOU SOUNDED AMAZING UP THERE.

06:01.390 --> 06:02.618
YOU KNOW, I DO A LITTLE
SINGING MYSELF.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.355
- YEAH, THANKS.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.153
DIDDLE WAS THE HEART
AND SOUL OF OUR GROUP.

06:06.190 --> 06:10.229
THE DAY HE WAS TAKEN FROM US
WAS THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED.

06:11.730 --> 06:14.597
- I JUST KEEP THINKING
HE CAN'T BE DEAD--HE CAN'T BE!

06:14.640 --> 06:17.200
AND THEN I LOOK AT THAT
CASKET AND I'M LIKE...

06:17.240 --> 06:18.662
THAT'S GO'I'I'A BE DIDDLE IN THERE.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.439
BECAUSE WHY WOULD
THEY PUT HIS PICTURE

06:20.480 --> 06:21.902
ON ANOTHER DUDE'S COFFIN?

06:21.940 --> 06:23.805
AND THAT'S WHEN I LOSE IT!

06:23.850 --> 06:26.512
- SO. . .TRAGIC.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.472
- LOOK, MAN...

06:28.520 --> 06:31.284
WE DON'T THINK THAT DIDDLE DIED
IN ANY BICYCLE ACCIDENT.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.379
I MEAN, HE WAS THE ONLY
BROTHER I KNEW

06:33.420 --> 06:35.081
WHO RODE A BICYCLE
AS A GROWN MAN.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.759
- WE THINK HE WAS MURDERED.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.156
- UH...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.656
HAVE YOU NOTIFIED THE POLICE?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.260
- WHAT IF THEY DID IT?
LOOK, NORMALLY...

06:44.300 --> 06:45.995
WE WOULDN'T EVEN
ASSOCIATE OURSELVES

06:46.030 --> 06:47.463
WITH SOMEBODY WHO WOULD PARTNER
UP WITH A BUSTER LIKE GUS.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.535
- BUSTER!

06:48.570 --> 06:49.662
- BUT I CHECKED OUT
THAT NEWSLETTER,

06:49.710 --> 06:51.200
AND THAT ARTICLE
MADE IT SEEM LIKE

06:51.240 --> 06:52.707
YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD
AT SOLVING STUFF

06:52.740 --> 06:54.230
WITHOUT A LOT OF EVIDENCE.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.339
- THE LESS EVIDENCE,
THE BETTER.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.507
- GOOD. 'CAUSE DIDDLE DOESN'T
DESERVE TO GO OUT LIKE THAT.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.517
NOT HIM.

06:59.550 --> 07:00.676
I MEAN, THE MAN
WAS BARELY 5'10"

07:00.720 --> 07:02.449
AND COULD DUNK
WITH TWO HANDS!

07:02.490 --> 07:04.913
THERE I GO AGAIN.
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.987
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
CAN WE HIRE YOU OR WHAT?

07:10.660 --> 07:11.888
- AH, YOU KNOW, MAN,

07:11.930 --> 07:15.923
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.496
THEN AGAIN...

07:17.530 --> 07:19.464
WHAT ARE BEST FRIENDS OF
MYSTERIOUSLY ESTRANGED

THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

07:36.650 --> 07:40.256
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

07:40.290 --> 07:41.848
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

07:41.890 --> 07:43.426
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

07:43.460 --> 07:47.920
* BUT WHY DANCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG *

07:47.960 --> 07:52.465
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN CRAWL *

07:54.370 --> 07:55.894
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:55.940 --> 07:57.828
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLIN' THE TRUTH *

07:57.870 --> 07:59.576
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:59.610 --> 08:01.407
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

08:01.440 --> 08:02.543
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

08:25.830 --> 08:28.037
NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,

08:28.070 --> 08:29.708
LET'S GO AHEAD
AND BRING GUS UP TO SPEED.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.800
- FINE. IT ALL STARTED
WHEN WE GOT THIS WEIRD EMAIL

08:32.840 --> 08:35.104
FROM DIDDLE
ON THE DAY THAT HE DIED.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.643
- "IT'S SO HARD
TO SAY GOOD-BYE."

08:37.680 --> 08:39.477
- YEAH. THERE'S A HUGE FILE
ATTACHED TO IT.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.842
IT'S NOT LIKE ANY FILE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.587
AND IT'S HEAVILY ENCRYPTED.
IT CAN'T BE OPENED.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.485
- I MEAN, WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE MESSAGE MEANS,

08:46.520 --> 08:48.613
BUT I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HIM DYING.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.787
- WHOA, WHOA, GUS, YOU'RE LISTED
AS A RECIPIENT HERE.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.252
DO YOU REMEMBER
GETTING THIS EMAIL?

08:52.290 --> 08:54.394
- YEAH, I GOT IT,
AND I IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED

08:54.430 --> 08:55.624
TO PLACE IT INTO THE TRASH BIN.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.128
- PSSSSH.
THAT'S COLD, B.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.467
- YO, THAT'S LIKE BEYONCE

08:59.500 --> 09:00.967
AND THE FIRST DESTINY'S CHILD
COLD.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.604
- ME AND DIDDLES' RELATIONSHIP
WAS ROCK SOLID.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.732
WE NEVER LOST CONTACT.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.738
BUT HE WOULD ALWAYS
SEND US THESE EMAILS

09:05.770 --> 09:07.374
ABOUT GETTING THE GROUP
BACK TOGETHER,

09:07.410 --> 09:09.298
WHICH WOULD INVOLVE RECONCILING
WITH THESE TWO JOKERS,

09:09.340 --> 09:11.649
AND THAT WAS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- MM-HMM. NOT HAPPENIN'.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.114
- NOT EVEN IF JESUS
WAS OUR MANAGER.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.368
- WHOA. YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS
ABOUT THAT, JOON.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.081
- NO, I AIN'T SERIOUS.
I WAS--I WAS PLAYIN'.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.781
- ALL RIGHT.
- GREAT. THEN IT'S SETTLED.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.980
THERE'LL BE NO REUNION

09:21.020 --> 09:24.023
UNLESS JESUS AGREES
TO MANAGE THE GROUP.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.756
- THAT'S FINE BY ME.
- MM-HMM.

09:28.530 --> 09:29.997
- [clears throat]

WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.578
IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.451
YOU'VE CLEARLY SUFFERED
A GREAT LOSS.

09:53.490 --> 09:54.912
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.484
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
THIS OPPORTUNITY

09:56.520 --> 09:57.726
TO MAKE DIDDLES' WISH
COME TRUE.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.022
- YEAH, BUT LOOK AT
THE DARK SIDE.

09:59.060 --> 10:01.119
BEING TOGETHER
MAKES A BAD SITUATION WORSE.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.128
- LOOK ON THE DARK SIDE?
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.797
YOU ARE STILL THE MOST
NEGATIVE DUDE I KNOW.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.731
- OKAY, GUYS, LET'S JUST, UH,
LET'S GET THE EMAIL UP

10:07.770 --> 10:09.635
AND, UH, WE'LL SEE
WHAT'S WHAT.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.830
- CALL ME NEGATIVE.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.701
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT
ALL THESE YEARS.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.503
I READ
THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE!

10:14.540 --> 10:17.202
- HEY, MAN, TRANSFORMATION
EQUALS CHANGE.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.445
- HUH. IT'S ENCRYPTED,
ALL RIGHT.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.846
- WELL, DE-CRYPTIFY IT.
[sniffs]

10:21.880 --> 10:24.212
- YOU CAN'T JUST
UN-ENCRYPT SOMETHING, SHAWN.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.615
YOU NEED A DATA KEY,
A PASS CODE,

10:25.650 --> 10:26.685
A COMPLEX ALGORITHM.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.789
WHATEVER THIS FILE IS,

10:27.820 --> 10:29.356
HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO PROTECT IT.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.652
- YOU KNOW,
DIDDLE WORKED FOR CYBERVAULT.

10:30.690 --> 10:33.295
- I KNOW. DIDDLE WORKED
FOR CYBERVAULT.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.423
- AW, THIS DUDE...
- COMPANIES HIRE THEM TO PROTECT

10:35.460 --> 10:37.018
AND ENCRYPT DATA
SENT OVER NETWORKS.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.233
- SO THEY CAN OR CANNOT LII-T
THE PARENTAL LOCK ON MY LAPTOP?

10:40.270 --> 10:42.261
- THAT WAS ME, SHAWN.
IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.836
- THEY PROTECT
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS,

10:43.870 --> 10:45.667
TRADE SECRETS,
CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.302
I MEAN, THOSE GUYS ARE RUNNING

10:47.340 --> 10:49.228
SOME SERIOUS BIG BROTHER-TYPE
STUFF OVER THERE.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.976
- WE THINK DIDDLE MAYBE STUMBLED
ACROSS SOME SECRET INFORMATION

10:52.010 --> 10:53.841
SOMEBODY WAS TRYING
TO GET THEIR HANDS ON.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.370
- NOW YOU FEEL
WHERE WE'RE COMIN' FROM.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.217
HOW 'BOUT YOU, GUS?
- OH, MAN.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.343
HE'S NOT EVEN HEARING IT,
MUCH LESS FEELIN' IT.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.755
- GUS, I THINK IT'S CLEAR
TO THE THREE OF US

11:00.790 --> 11:02.417
THAT YOU'RE NEITHER HEARING IT
NOR FEELING IT.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.578
WHAT I CAN'T DISCERN IS
ARE YOU MAD AT IT?

11:06.630 --> 11:08.029
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.199
WE NEED TO RETRACE
DIDDLES' FINAL STEPS.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.619
- OKAY. DIDDLES' TIME OF DEATH
WAS PEGGED

11:12.670 --> 11:14.638
RIGHT Al-TER
HE SENT THE EMAIL.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.900
SO YOU GOTTA FIGURE HE HAD
JUST LEI-T THE APARTMENT.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.134
- BRILLIANT!
WE'LL START THERE.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.307
- WE'RE HELPING THE FAMILY
COLLECT SOME OF HIS THINGS

11:23.350 --> 11:26.774
SO WE CAN GAIN FULL ACCESS.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.549
HO HO HO HO!

11:28.580 --> 11:30.787
NO, HE DIDN'T KEEP THESE.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.209
- HA.
- WHAT?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.626
- LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE,
LET ME SEE.

11:38.660 --> 11:40.594
[laughter]

11:45.700 --> 11:47.998
- MINE STILL FITS!
- MINE DOES TOO.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.769
- LIKE YESTERDAY.
- LET'S DO THE STEPS.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.131
- ALL RIGHT.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.035
* UH, UH

11:56.710 --> 11:58.746
- YEAH!
- WHOO!

11:58.780 --> 12:00.873
_ OH--

12:03.290 --> 12:05.588
- MINE SMELLS LIKE MOTHBALLS.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.384
- YEAH, MINE SMELLS LIKE MOLD.
- LIKE MY GRANDMAMA FEET.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.821
- YOU THINK I COULD HAVE
DIDDLES'?

12:13.860 --> 12:16.420
- NO. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.825
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.065
WAS HE ALWAYS
THIS SAFETY-CONSCIOUS?

12:20.100 --> 12:21.761
- ONCE IN COLLEGE,
HE LEI-T HIS SEATBELT ON

12:21.800 --> 12:23.768
DURING A DRIVE-IN MOVIE.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.209
- YOU MEAN
HE'S NOT THE KINDA GUY

12:25.240 --> 12:27.333
THAT WOULD GO CYCLING WITHOUT
HIS PROTECTIVE CYCLING GEAR.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.770
- GOOD POINT.
- CHECK THAT OUT.

12:30.810 --> 12:33.813
WHO USES A POWER STRIP
FOR ONE PLUG?

12:33.850 --> 12:36.819
I'M SENSING THAT SOME OF
DIDDLES' COMPUTER EQUIPMENT

12:36.850 --> 12:38.112
HAS BEEN STOLEN
AND THAT THERE IS

12:38.150 --> 12:41.085
MORE GOING ON HERE
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.825
- HI, JULES.
HI, OLD PENGUIN FROM HAPPY FEET.

12:45.860 --> 12:46.849
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.253
- I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR

12:48.300 --> 12:50.029
THAT LEONARD IS A FRIEND
OF YOURS, GUS,

12:50.070 --> 12:51.628
BUT WE LOOKED AT IT AGAIN,

12:51.670 --> 12:53.729
AND WE AGREE WITH
THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.533
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS A GRISLY ACCIDENT,

12:55.570 --> 12:57.834
IT IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD
HIT AND RUN.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.758
- THAT'S IT?
CAN WE LOOK INTO IT?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.004
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.371
CITY'S CUTTING DOWN
ON WASTEFUL SPENDING.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.401
THAT INCLUDES ALL
NON-ESSENTIAL EXPENDITURES.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.372
AND WE ALREADY HAVE A TEAM
ON THE HIT AND RUN,

13:06.410 --> 13:08.674
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO NEED
FOR A PSYCHIC CONSULTATION.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.381
ANYTHING ELSE?
- WOW.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.581
DID LASSITER JUST THROW
HIS VOICE INTO YOUR MOUTH?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.781
BECAUSE THAT'S
REALLY UNSANITARY.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.755
- THAT'S NICE WORK, O'HARA.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.553
SHOO, FLIES.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.718
- IF I COULD JUST GET A PSYCHIC
READING ON THE AUTOPSY REPORT--

13:22.760 --> 13:24.159
- AH, GOSH, I'M SORRY,
SEE THAT WOULD REQUIRE

13:24.200 --> 13:26.225
ONE MEETING WITH
THE NEW CORONER

13:26.270 --> 13:27.897
WHICH REQUIRES
AN OFFICIAL POLICE DETAIL

13:27.940 --> 13:31.364
WHICH ONE DOES NOT HAVE BECAUSE
ONE IS NOT WELCOME HERE.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.332
SHOO.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.371
AND WE'RE SHOOING.

13:35.410 --> 13:37.275
WE'RE SHOOING.
WE'RE SHOOING.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.346
AUF WIEDERSEHEN.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.947
- [whispers]
SWEET.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.743
- YOU HEARD LASSITER.
WE NEED A POLICE DETAIL.

13:43.790 --> 13:47.419
- DON'T BE THE AMERICAN
ADAPTATION OF THE BRITISH GUS.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.451
- I'M NOT IMPERSONATING
A CORONER, SHAWN.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.583
- FINE. YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN THEN.
- NO, NO.

13:51.630 --> 13:52.995
IT'S THE ONE
WITHOUT ANY TEETH.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.054
- TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

13:54.100 --> 13:56.421
MY KNEES AND CALVES
ARE LOCKING UP!

13:56.460 --> 13:58.394
YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

13:58.430 --> 14:00.864
- DO IT FOR DIDDLE.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.205
- I GET CLAUSTROPHOBIC, SHAWN.
- YOU'RE A CADAVER.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.049
WE HAVE TO COVER YOU
BECAUSE CADAVERS

14:10.080 --> 14:11.809
DON'T WEAR SHIRTS
FROM ABERCROMBIE AND FLETCH.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.044
- IT'S ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.741
AND, NO, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD IT BOTH WAYS!

14:14.780 --> 14:16.418
- SHH!

14:16.450 --> 14:18.247
OH, HEY THERE.
- HI.

14:18.290 --> 14:21.179
- YOU MUST BE THE NEW CORONER.
- YEAH. I JUST TRANSFERRED OVER.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.188
BUT DON'T WORRY, I'VE BEEN
PLAYING WITH DEAD THINGS

14:23.230 --> 14:24.549
SINCE I WAS A TODDLER.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.126
- WELL, I'M SHAWN SPENCER.
- HI.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.151
THIS DEAD BODY HERE
IS DETECTIVE MILES.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.225
- OHH...ANOTHER ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS, HUH?

14:30.270 --> 14:32.158
- NO, SIR.
HIS FIRST NAME IS DETECTIVE.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.997
- OF COURSE.
WELL, LEAVE HIM RIGHT THERE

14:34.040 --> 14:35.359
WHILE I PREPARE A TOE TAG.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.561
- FAIR ENOUGH.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.566
YOU KNOW, AN EMT BUDDY OF MINE

14:39.610 --> 14:42.408
SAID HE BROUGHT IN A HIT
AND RUN VICTIM THE OTHER DAY.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.670
NASTY STUFF, HUH?
- YEAH, I WORKED THAT SPECIMEN.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.200
IT WAS PRETTY BAD,
BUT CONSISTENT WITH

14:46.250 --> 14:47.410
AN AUTOMOBILE/ CYCLING
COLLISION--

14:47.450 --> 14:49.941
MULTIPLE CRANIAL FRACTURES,
CRUSHED LARYNX,

14:49.990 --> 14:52.743
FRACTURED HYOID BONE,
CONTUSIONS THIS,

14:52.790 --> 14:54.189
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA THAT.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.781
STUPID GOVERNMENT PENS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.827
- A CRUSHED LARYNX
AND BROKEN HYOID

15:00.860 --> 15:03.090
COULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT
WITH ASPHYXIATION.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.927
- DID YOU SAY
A TOKEN HEMORRHOID?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.722
- I SAID BROKEN HYOID--
- OKAY, SHH!

15:06.770 --> 15:08.761
[clears throat]
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.007
THAT'S, UH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
WHAT HE SAID.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.769
THEN HE WENT ON TO SAY
SOMETHING PRETTY CRAZY.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.836
THAT THE CRUSHED LARYNX
AND HYOID

15:15.880 --> 15:19.145
COULD HAVE MEANT
THAT HE WAS ASPHYXIATED.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.579
- ASPHYXIATION?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.144
THAT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.638
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- UNLESS THIS CRASH...

15:25.690 --> 15:28.579
WAS POSTMORTEM.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.656
THAT WAS MY CARUSO.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.783
[laughing]
YEAH, NOT BAD, RIGHT?

15:32.830 --> 15:34.752
[chuckles]
OH, MAN!

15:34.800 --> 15:36.791
I'M GONNA NEED
ANOTHER RELEASE FORM.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.560
I FILLED THIS OUT
IN FARSI BY MISTAKE.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.568
I'VE BEEN USING THE ROSETTA
STONE TO LEARN NEW LANGUAGES

15:41.600 --> 15:43.238
IN MY DOWN TIME.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.703
- THAT COMPUTER SOFTWARE
REALLY WORKS, HUH?

15:44.740 --> 15:46.332
- WAIT A SECOND.

15:46.370 --> 15:47.769
THERE'S SOl-TWARE CALLED
THE ROSETTA STONE TOO?

15:47.810 --> 15:50.677
- OH! [laughs] WOW!
YOU GOT ME!

15:50.710 --> 15:52.302
TOUCHE!
- REVENGE!

15:52.350 --> 15:53.817
- AH, AH--PFFI'!

15:53.850 --> 15:56.512
I'VE GOT SOME MORE RELEASE
FORMS IN THE BACK, YOU BOOB!

15:56.550 --> 15:58.040
[both laughing]

15:58.090 --> 15:59.512
- DUDE, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

15:59.550 --> 16:01.552
HE SAID SOMEONE COULD HAVE
USED THE HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT

16:01.590 --> 16:03.285
TO COVER UP THE WAY
THAT DIDDLE REALLY DIED.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.218
THAT MEANS TONY AND JOON
WERE RIGHT--THIS WAS MURDER!

16:05.260 --> 16:06.921
- SHAWN.
IS THE GUY STILL HERE?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.996
- OH, HE'S IN THE BACK.
I REALLY DIDN'T MIND HIM THOUGH.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.567
- YEAH. HE'S A REAL CHARACTER.
NOW, CAN WE GET OUTTA HERE?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.237
- POOR DIDDLE.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.067
THEY PROBABLY THREATENED
TO TORTURE HIM FIRST

16:19.110 --> 16:20.338
THEN TORTURED HIM SECOND.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.269
THEN THEY PROBABLY THREATENED
TO KILL HIM THIRD.

16:23.310 --> 16:24.299
THEN THEY KILLED HIM FOURTH.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.476
- STOP MAKING UP
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

16:25.510 --> 16:26.704
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF THEY TORTURED HIM.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.479
- I DO KNOW,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.010
- WHO IS "THEY?"
- "THEM."

16:30.050 --> 16:32.439
- HE SHOULD'VE
JUST PLAYED DEAD, MAN.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.855
I ALWAYS SAY
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO

16:33.890 --> 16:35.915
IF SOMEBODY
WAS TRYING TO KILL ME--

16:35.960 --> 16:37.757
JUST PLAY DEAD.
I MEAN, THEY'D BE LIKE...

16:37.790 --> 16:39.985
"WE'RE GONNA KILL YOU!"
AND THEN I'D BE LIKE...DEAD.

16:40.030 --> 16:41.520
THEN THEY'D BE LIKE,
"OH, HE'S DEAD.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.869
LET'S GO KILL SOMEBODY ELSE."
AND THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.198
- GUYS, I'M AFRAID
I HAVE MORE BAD NEWS.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.198
WHOEVER THEY ARE,
THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT

16:48.240 --> 16:50.367
DIDDLE EMAILED THE THREE OF YOU
THE FILE THAT THEY'RE Al-TER.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.037
THAT MEANS YOU GUYS COULD BE
IN SOME SERIOUS DANGER.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.106
- I DIDN'T GET ANY EMAIL.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.074
- WHAT?
WE ALL GOT THE EMAIL.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.146
- Y'ALL GOT IT--I DIDN'T.
- DUDE, YOU CAN'T PRETEND

16:58.180 --> 16:59.545
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THIS.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.548
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER.
- YOU DO TOO!

17:01.580 --> 17:03.013
- I DIDN'T GET THE EMAIL
EITHER THEN.

17:03.050 --> 17:04.779
- YOU TWO WOULD EVEN SELL OUT
EACH OTHER, WOULDN'T YOU?

17:04.820 --> 17:06.617
- DON'T TALK TO ME, CRAZY.
I SAID I DIDN'T GET IT.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.015
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, MAN.
[car alarm beeps]

17:14.360 --> 17:16.248
HEY,
MY MAMA BOUGHT ME THAT CAR!

17:16.300 --> 17:18.791
- I'M NOT WITH YOU!

17:31.910 --> 17:33.411
- OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

17:33.450 --> 17:34.610
- NOW DO YOU BELIEVE
THERE'S A CASE?

17:34.650 --> 17:35.844
- WE NEED TO SEE
IF THE BOMB SQUAD

17:35.880 --> 17:37.313
HAS ANY EVIDENCE WE CAN TRACE
LIKE RESIDUE,

17:37.350 --> 17:39.489
FRAGMENTS, DETONATORS--
- SLOW DOWN, OKAY?

17:39.520 --> 17:41.511
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
YOU BEING PUT ON THIS CASE.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.515
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE ANYMORE.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.152
WE'RE UNDER DIRECT ORDERS
FROM THE CHIEF.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.726
- NOW, CLEARLY,
SOMETHING'S GOING ON,

17:45.760 --> 17:47.625
BUT THE TOP BRASS HAS INSTITUTED
A WHOLE NEW LAYER OF PROTOCOL.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.150
WHICH MEANS THE FIRST THING
WE NEED TO DO

17:49.200 --> 17:51.498
IS RUN FULL BACKGROUND CHECKS
ON YOUR PALS,

17:51.530 --> 17:53.634
MAKE SURE ALL THE SHADINESS
DOESN'T START WITH THEM.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.262
- YOU ARE KIDDING, RIGHT?
- NO, I'M NOT, GUSTER.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.131
AND YOUR ATTITUDE
SIMPLY CONFIRMS

17:57.170 --> 17:59.309
THAT THIS CASE PRESENTS
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR YOU,

17:59.340 --> 18:01.433
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY
YOU WON'T BE GETTING INVOLVED.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.107
- OKAY, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?

18:03.150 --> 18:06.244
- JUST SIT TIGHT.
- AND TAKE THE BUS.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.747
- CARLTON.
- WHAT?

18:07.780 --> 18:10.487
TOO SOON?
[scoffs]

18:15.560 --> 18:17.755
- ALL RIGHT, JULES,

18:17.790 --> 18:21.499
I'M NOW ENTERING
OUR CONE OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

18:21.530 --> 18:23.498
- GET TO THE POINT, SHAWN.
I'M REALLY BUSY.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.395
- LET'S BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.263
THIS IS YOU PAYING ME BACK
FOR THE AWKWARDNESS AND TENSION

18:28.300 --> 18:30.734
THAT I'VE ALLOWED ABIGAIL
TO CAUSE BETWEEN US.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.362
- CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MAY
THINK, SHAWN,

18:32.410 --> 18:34.071
IT ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.475
WHEN I OPEN AN INVESTIGATION,

18:35.510 --> 18:38.570
I HAVE TO ANSWER TO PEOPLE
IN AUTHORITY ABOVE ME.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.248
- [sighs]
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.669
ESPECIALLY IF, BY CONTRARY
TO WHAT I BELIEVE,

18:42.720 --> 18:43.880
IT ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT ME,

18:43.920 --> 18:45.387
AND WHEN YOU OPEN
AN INVESTIGATION

18:45.420 --> 18:47.183
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER TO PEOPLE
IN AUTHORITY ABOVE YOU,

18:47.220 --> 18:49.711
YOU MEAN
IT'S BECAUSE OF ABIGAIL.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.318
- IS THIS THE PART
WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GIGGLE,

18:51.360 --> 18:53.499
BECAUSE YOUR BOYISH CHARM
IS JUST TOO IRRESISTIBLE?

18:53.530 --> 18:55.350
- ALMOST. I WAS GONNA
BRING IT HOME

18:55.400 --> 18:57.197
DOING BOTH SIDES
OF THE CONVERSATION

18:57.230 --> 18:59.721
[falsetto] USING MY HIGH-PITCHED
EIGHTH GRADE JULES VOICE.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.533
- I'M SURE THAT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND APPRECIATES YOU

19:01.570 --> 19:05.028
USING HER AS A TACTIC
TO SCAM INFORMATION.

19:05.070 --> 19:06.731
GOLD STAR, SHAWN.
REALLY.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.743
- WELL?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.270
- CRASHED AND BURNED.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.379
THEN SOMEHOW CRASHED AGAIN
IN CHILE,

19:15.420 --> 19:17.115
ONLY TO BE EATEN
BY MY SOCCER TEAM MATES.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.311
WE'RE ON OUR OWN.
THAT MUCH IS CLEAR.

19:19.350 --> 19:21.181
WE'LL STASH TONY AND JOON
AT MY DAD'S PLACE.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.085
THAT WAY WE CAN FOCUS
ON THE CASE.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.384
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS
ON THAT ENCRYPTED FILE.

19:25.430 --> 19:26.829
- I TOLD YOU
IT WAS WAY TOO COM PLICATED

19:26.860 --> 19:28.054
FOR ANY NORMAL PERSON
TO CRACK.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.453
- WELL, THEN WE'LL
FIND SOMEPLACE

19:29.500 --> 19:31.092
WITH PEOPLE
JUST AS SMART AS DIDDLE

19:31.130 --> 19:33.735
LIKE A CHEMISTRY LAB OR...

19:33.770 --> 19:36.762
- CYBERVAU LT?
- WHAT?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.734
BRINGING YOUR GOOD STUFF
TODAY, MAN.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.626
- I'LL FIGURE OUT
THE PROCESSING POWER

20:01.660 --> 20:03.196
WE'LL NEED TO RUN
OUR LOCALIZED SERVERS

20:03.230 --> 20:04.367
AND REPORT IT TO IT.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.459
BETTER YET, YOU DO IT.
- COPY.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.388
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OPEN SOURCE CODING SEMINAR?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.431
- YEAH, I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT.
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.473
- HERE'S AN IDEA.
I'LL DO IT.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.807
- LET ME TAKE THE LEAD
ON THIS ONE, SHAWN.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.149
YOU'RE WAY OUT OF
YOUR ELEMENT HERE.

20:19.180 --> 20:20.442
- MAKE IT QUICK, GENTLEMEN.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.311
- THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH US, SIR.

20:22.350 --> 20:23.817
- MY NAME IS GUS...BROWN,

20:23.850 --> 20:25.511
AND THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE
SHAWN WHITE.

20:25.550 --> 20:26.744
- [whispers] WOW.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.610
- WE'RE PERSONAL FRIENDS
OF LEONARD CALLAHAN,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.525
AND WE'RE WONDERING
IF SOMEONE HERE COULD HELP US

20:30.560 --> 20:31.959
WITH ONE OF HIS
ENCRYPTED FILES.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.526
- I DOUBT IT.
LEONARD WAS THE BEST WE HAD.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.925
NO ONE COULD BREAK
HIS ENCRYPTIONS.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.394
HE EVEN HAD PATENTS ON THEM.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.398
I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT...

20:39.430 --> 20:41.796
WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON
BEFORE HE DIED.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.501
I DON'T SUPPOSE EITHER OF YOU

20:43.540 --> 20:45.667
CAN CREATE AN 802.1q
SPANNING TREE LOOP

20:45.710 --> 20:48.702
USING AUTO FORWARDING
NON-WINTEL BASED EQUIPMENT?

20:48.740 --> 20:51.777
- I CAN MAKE A STRAW WRAPPER
CRAWL LIKE A WORM.

20:51.810 --> 20:56.315
OH, AND, UH...MAKE THE INSIDE
OF MY ELBOW LOOK LIKE A BUTT.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.358
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
- [softly] SEE?

21:02.590 --> 21:03.750
[whispers] DUDE,
IT'S DIDDLE'S CUBICLE.

21:03.790 --> 21:05.382
- MAYBE THERE'S A CLUE THERE

21:05.430 --> 21:07.125
ABOUT WHAT WAS ON THAT
ENCRYPTED FILE.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.594
- THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS
THINKING, GUS.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.333
WOW.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.895
THIS GUY'S ALMOST
AS ORGANIZED AS YOU ARE.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.532
- THOSE OTHER TWO BROTHERS,

21:17.570 --> 21:19.003
THEY COULDN'T COLOR-TAB THEIR
WAY OUT OF THE STAPLES.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.064
- REALLY? NOW YOU'RE ON THEM

21:20.110 --> 21:21.600
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
ANAL-RETENTIVE ENOUGH?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.005
- I'M JUST SAYING...
- WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.246
- MOVE ON, SHAWN.

21:33.590 --> 21:36.616
- DUDE, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO THIS.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.218
[blowing]

21:42.860 --> 21:45.590
LOOK WHAT I JUST DID.
I'M LIKE MR. WIZARD.

21:45.630 --> 21:50.636
I WONDER WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THOSE ADDRESSES.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.578
THAT'S INTERESTING.
- WHAT?

22:12.290 --> 22:14.258
- YOUR BOY LIKED BIG BUTTS,
AND I CANNOT LIE.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.824
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN?

22:15.860 --> 22:17.794
- LOOKS LIKE DIDDLE
HAD A LITTLE STALKER IN HIM.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.594
- DIDDLE WAS A SAINT, SHAWN.
DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.859
OHH...
I'M NOT MAD AT HIM.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.275
- EXCUSE US.

22:31.310 --> 22:32.777
WE WERE NEVER
FORMALLY INTRODUCED.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.517
I'M WORLD-RENOWNED
PSYCHIC/LOTHARIO SHAWN SPENCER.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.279
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE--
- GUS.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.049
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
JOHN SLADE.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.387
- I'M CHELSEA.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.752
- I'M GETTING
A PSYCHIC TRANSMISSION

22:42.790 --> 22:44.257
RIGHT HERE
AS WE SPEAK, CHELSEA.

22:44.290 --> 22:46.520
A FLEETING GLANCE,

22:46.560 --> 22:48.790
A STOLEN MOMENT
BETWEEN COWORKERS.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.196
LEONARD HAD A LITTLE THING
FOR YOU, DIDN'T HE?

22:51.230 --> 22:53.994
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
- PSYCH--PSYCHIC--I'M--

22:54.040 --> 22:55.359
- I COULD ALWAYS TELL,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.288
THE WAY HE'D...
HOLD THE DOOR FOR ME

22:57.340 --> 22:59.365
OR OFFER TO HELP
CARRY MY FILES.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.002
HE FINALLY GOT UP THE NERVE
TO ASK ME OUT

23:01.040 --> 23:03.201
RIGHT BEFORE HE, UH...

23:04.350 --> 23:05.749
HE WAS VERY SWEET.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.816
YOU DON'T MEET MANY GUYS
LIKE THAT THESE DAYS.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.114
- OH. THERE, THERE.

23:10.150 --> 23:12.641
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.352
- DO YOU RECALL ANYTHING UNUSUAL
ABOUT HIS FINAL DAYS?

23:15.390 --> 23:17.119
- OH, WE JUST STARTED TALKING.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.822
I NEVER...GOT TO KNOW HIM
ALL THAT WELL.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.055
HE SURE LOVED
HIS MUSIC, THOUGH.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.591
ALWAYS HUMMING
OR RIFFING ON SONGS

23:24.630 --> 23:26.359
OVER THERE IN HIS CUBICLE.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.539
TALKING ABOUT SOME GROUP
HE USED TO SING WITH

23:28.570 --> 23:29.730
BACK IN COLLEGE.

23:29.770 --> 23:31.635
- BLACKAPELLA.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.275
I WAS A PART OF THAT GROUP,
BUT...

23:34.310 --> 23:35.709
ANYWAY.

23:35.740 --> 23:37.549
IF YOU CAN THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE

23:37.580 --> 23:40.071
OR IF YOU JUST NEED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO, PLEASE...

23:40.110 --> 23:41.839
FEEL FREE
TO GIVE US A CALL.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.108
THIS IS MY WORK CARD,

23:43.150 --> 23:45.038
BUT MY PERSONAL CELL NUMBER'S
ON THE BACK.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.150
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, CHELSEA.

23:48.190 --> 23:49.555
- ALL RIGHT.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.922
- DUDE, YOU REALIZE
THAT'S THE THIRD VARIATION

23:51.960 --> 23:53.325
OF "MY WORK CARD WITH

23:53.360 --> 23:55.089
MY SOME OTHER NUMBER ON THE BACK
IN PENCIL" MOVE

23:55.130 --> 23:56.893
THAT YOU'VE USED
THIS MONTH ALONE?

23:56.930 --> 23:58.921
- IT'S CALLED SHOWING OFF
MY PENMANSHIP, SHAWN.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.096
- UH-HUH.

24:00.130 --> 24:02.337
- ANCIENT CULTURE SAW IT
AS A SIGN OF VIRILITY.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.408
- HEY! OW. OW.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.372
- SHUT UP.
- DAD.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.139
WE LEI-T THEM HERE WITH YOU
TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.579
WHO DID THIS?
- THEY DID.

24:16.620 --> 24:17.985
DAMN FOOLS SHOT THEMSELVES.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.238
WHO THE HELL LEI-T THEM
WITH A BB GUN, SHAWN?

24:20.290 --> 24:21.416
- I DID.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.779
I MEAN,
THEY SAID THEY WANTED

24:22.820 --> 24:24.378
TO BE ABLE
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

24:24.430 --> 24:25.829
- DUMB MOVE.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.350
- AAH! AHH!
- WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?

24:27.390 --> 24:30.723
THE BB BOUNCED OFF YOU.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MADE OF RUBBER.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.419
I THOUGHT
YOU TWO WERE WUSSES.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.358
YOU'RE COMMANDOES
COMPARED TO THESE GUYS.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.436
- YO, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING,

24:36.470 --> 24:38.006
'CAUSE OUR LIVES
MAY DEPEND ON IT.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.905
- BOY, YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
- DON'T YOU WORRY.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.430
MY META-ETHEREAL GAME

24:41.480 --> 24:43.004
IS AS TIGHT AS GUS'S
WORKOUT SHORTS.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.201
CHECKING SOME ADDRESSES HERE

24:45.250 --> 24:47.445
THAT ARE PSYCHICALLY LINKED
TO YOUR BOY DIDDLE.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.846
[cell phone vibrating]
HELLO.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.711
- HELLO.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.719
YES. THIS IS JOHN SLADE.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.627
OH, HEY, CHELSEA.
HOW YOU DOING?

24:57.660 --> 24:59.787
NO, NO.
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

24:59.830 --> 25:02.993
DRINKS LATER?
OKAY, SURE.

25:03.030 --> 25:05.669
ALL RIGHT.
BYE-BYE.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.964
- WHO THE HELL IS JOHN SLADE?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.536
- HELL, NO, B.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.868
I KNOW YOU NOT USING
DIDDLE'S DEATH

25:11.910 --> 25:14.037
TO TRY TO GET SOME PLAY
WITH THAT SHORTY.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.502
- ALL I DID WAS GIVE HER
MY NUMBER

25:15.540 --> 25:16.734
IN CASE SHE NEEDED TO TALK.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.008
- OH, YEAH, LET ME GUESS.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.642
DID YOU WRITE IT OUT FOR HER

25:19.680 --> 25:21.147
SO SHE COULD SEE
YOUR GOOD PENMANSHIP?

25:21.180 --> 25:22.511
I TAUGHT YOU THAT MOVE, B.

25:22.550 --> 25:25.041
- SAY IT AIN'T SO, B.
- WHO THE HELL IS B?

25:25.090 --> 25:26.489
- EVERYONE BUT YOU.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.249
- YO, GUS WILL ALWAYS
SELL OUT HIS BOYS

25:28.290 --> 25:30.508
FOR SOME WOMAN.
- MM-HMM.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.187
- AMEN TO THAT.
- WHAT?

25:32.230 --> 25:34.027
- JUST LAST WEEK, YOU LEI-T ME
STRANDED AT A COCO'S

25:34.060 --> 25:35.948
TO HELP SOME CHICK
TO MOVE A FOOSBALL TABLE.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.298
- SISTER HAD GREEN EYES, SHAWN.
THAT'S A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.265
- DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.
GUS HAS NEVER HONORED THE CODE.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.905
- OH, SO YOU WANNA GO THERE?
- OH, WE CAN GO THERE.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.339
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS?
- WE CAN GO THERE.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.837
- YOU WANNA BRING UP THE PAST
AI-TER ALL THESE YEARS.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.337
- ABSOLUTELY.
- FELLAS, FELLAS.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.575
IT HASN'T REALLY
BEEN LONG ENOUGH, OKAY?

25:50.610 --> 25:53.147
IT STILL KINDA CUTS DEEP
LIKE A MACHETE IN THE BUSH.

25:53.180 --> 25:54.670
- I'M THE ONE
THAT SHOULD BE HURT.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.039
YOU TWO SLEPT WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.117
- SHE WASN'T YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
SHE WAS A GROUPIE!

25:59.150 --> 26:01.209
- AN A CAPPELLA GROUPIE?
THAT EXISTS?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.386
- HEY, IT WAS COLLEGE, B.

26:02.420 --> 26:03.956
I MEAN, WE HAD
THE MATCHING JACKETS...

26:03.990 --> 26:06.356
AND FREE BISCUITS AND GRAW
AI-TER EVERY SHOW.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.028
- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
YOU TWO SAW HER AS.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.528
I WAS WAY INTO HER AND SHE
WAS INTO ME, AND YOU KNEW THAT.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.528
- YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH A GROUPIE.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.538
THAT'S PART OF THE CODE!
- EVEN PATRICK FUGIT KNOWS THAT.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.265
- YOU ALSO DON'T SLEEP WITH
YOUR BANDMATE'S GIRL.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.131
THAT'S THE CODE!

26:18.170 --> 26:19.831
- I THOUGHT THE CODE WAS ABOUT
NOT HAVING A FLING

26:19.870 --> 26:21.474
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S SISTER.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.671
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HOOKED UP WITH JOY?

26:23.710 --> 26:24.677
- WHAT?
- WELL...

26:24.710 --> 26:25.870
- MY HERO!
- GIMME SOME.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.617
- STOP IT, SHAWN.
- NO, YOU STOP IT, G-WHIZ.

26:28.650 --> 26:32.108
YOU BROKE UP BLACKAPELLA, MAN.
WE WERE GOING PLACES!

26:32.150 --> 26:33.754
THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS OUR OYSTER, MAN.

26:33.790 --> 26:35.052
EVERYBODY LOVED US.

26:35.090 --> 26:36.682
- DID YOU SEE THAT VIDEO
AT THE FUNERAL?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.051
WE LOOKED LIKE IDIOTS.

26:38.090 --> 26:40.854
THOSE WERE HAMMER PANTS.
FIVE YEARS BEHIND THE CURVE.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.697
IT WASN'T ABOUT BECOMING
THE NEXT ANYBODY.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.493
WE PLAYED A FEW SHOWS
AT THE STUDENT CENTER

26:44.530 --> 26:46.168
AND THE CINNAMON FESTIVAL,
AND THAT'S IT.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.758
IT WAS ABOUT COLLEGE
AND FRIENDSHIP

26:47.800 --> 26:49.233
AND HAVING THE BEST TIMES
OF OUR LIVES.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.659
AND YOU BETRAYED ME.
THE BOTH OF YOU.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.372
GOT YOUR MINDS MIXED UP
IN ALL KINDS OF NONSENSE,

26:54.410 --> 26:56.799
AND IT BROKE MY HEART!

27:01.780 --> 27:03.247
- [clears throat]
WELL...

27:03.280 --> 27:05.009
TONY, JOON,

27:05.050 --> 27:07.143
WE'RE ALL OVER THIS CASE, OKAY?

27:07.190 --> 27:08.817
WE'RE GONNA GO CHECK OUT
TH ESE ADDRESSES,

27:08.860 --> 27:10.316
AND WE WILL REPORT BACK
WHAT WE FIND.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.055
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU TWO STAY PUT.

27:27.340 --> 27:28.500
- SHH!

27:44.390 --> 27:46.085
DIDDLE WAS HERE
THE NIGHT THAT HE DIED.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.995
- THAT'S MESSED UP.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.452
- WHAT THE--

27:49.500 --> 27:51.718
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU GUYS
TO STAY AT MY DAD'S.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.123
- YEAH, BUT THEN YOU
GAVE US THE NOD.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.535
SO CLEARLY
YOU WERE SAYING, MAN,

27:54.570 --> 27:56.458
DON'T TRUST SOMETHING
THIS IMPORTANT TO GUS, B.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.502
- NO. I'M NOT NEARLY ADEPT
ENOUGH AT USING "B"

27:58.540 --> 27:59.802
TO WORK IT INTO A NOD.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.377
I WAS JUST--I WAS SAYING,
"GOOD-BYE FOR NOW."

28:02.410 --> 28:04.549
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH THE NOD?

28:04.580 --> 28:06.275
- NEVER. YOU'VE NEVER ONCE
SAID THAT TO ME.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.447
- OKAY--
- BOTTOM LINE...

28:07.480 --> 28:08.947
IF YOU WANT THIS CASE
TO GET SOLVED,

28:08.980 --> 28:11.778
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US,
AND YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.879
YOU'RE TARGETS, REMEMBER?

28:13.920 --> 28:15.319
- ALL RIGHT.
- BET.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.385
- OKAY. WE'RE GONNA
CHECK THIS OUT.

28:17.420 --> 28:20.526
YOU GO BACK TO MY DAD'S
AND STAY PUT.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.448
WE'LL CHECK IN
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.328
- WE'LL WAIT FIVE MINUTES

28:26.370 --> 28:28.099
AND THEN FOLLOW THEM INSIDE
WITH THE BB GUNS.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.892
- OH, YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
- OKAY.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.909
- IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS PARTY'S OVER.

28:41.950 --> 28:44.441
- IT ACTUALLY LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE STEVE MARTIN'S OFFICE

28:44.490 --> 28:45.980
IN THE SPANISH PRISONER.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.749
- HELP!
- GUS!

28:47.790 --> 28:50.111
- HELP!
- GUS!

28:52.790 --> 28:55.224
- THEY GOT TONY_ AND JOON!
- [screaming]

29:11.050 --> 29:13.177
- TELL ME YOU HAVE A PLAN.
- SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP, GUSTER.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.871
WE'LL BE DOING THE TALKING.
- EXCUSE ME?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.672
TWO OF MY FRIENDS ARE MISSING,
AND I'M NEXT ON THE LIST.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.914
I THINK I'M ENTITLED TO--

29:17.950 --> 29:19.247
- YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.416
AND AS FAR AS YOUR FRIENDS GO,

29:20.450 --> 29:21.986
YOU'VE GOT NOBODY BUT YOURSELF
TO BLAME

29:22.020 --> 29:23.282
FOR THEM BEING
IN HARM'S WAY.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.548
- WHAT? YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

29:24.590 --> 29:27.229
HOW YOU GONNA--
- ENOUGH, BOTH OF YOU.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.820
NOW, GUS, I KNOW THIS MUST BE
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU,

29:29.860 --> 29:31.521
BUT LASSITER IS RIGHT--
YOUR FRIENDS HAD ABSOLUTELY

29:31.570 --> 29:33.219
NO BUSINESS BEING
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT WAREHOUSE.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.192
- THEY FOLLOWED US, JULES.
WHAT WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

29:35.240 --> 29:36.935
WE TRIED TO STASH THEM
AT MY DAD'S.

29:36.970 --> 29:38.767
THEY BOLTED
WHILE HE WAS ON THE THRONE.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.630
WE TOLD YOU GUYS THERE WAS
SOMETHING ROTTEN IN SWEDEN,

29:40.670 --> 29:41.637
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.079
- I AM ORDERING YOU TWO

29:43.110 --> 29:44.668
TO LAY LOW
AND STAY OUT OF OUR WAY.

29:44.710 --> 29:47.042
- WE WILL CALL YOU
WHEN WE FIND YOUR FRIENDS.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.479
AND SHAWN, IF YOU ARE FEELING

29:48.520 --> 29:50.078
ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT,

29:50.120 --> 29:51.917
YOU BETTER TELL US RIGHT NOW.
- OH, REALLY?

29:51.950 --> 29:53.247
WOULD THAT BE USEFUL?

29:53.290 --> 29:55.178
I THINK I'M GONNA PUT ALL MY
ENERGY INTO MAKING SURE

29:55.220 --> 29:57.279
THAT MY BEST FRIEND
ISN'T THE NEXT DOMINO TO FALL,

29:57.320 --> 29:59.459
SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE LEAST OF YOUR CONCERNS.

29:59.490 --> 30:01.219
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, WE JUST--
- JUST NOTHING.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.626
TIME IS WASTING.
LET'S GO, O'HARA.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.922
- COME ON.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.392
I KNOW WHAT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.159
[pat pat]

30:11.970 --> 30:13.801
FEEL BETTER?
- A LITTLE.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.831
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WANTED TO
PUNCH LASSITER IN THE FACE

30:15.880 --> 30:17.438
BEFORE TODAY.
- REALLY?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.573
- YOU KNOW, THE WORST PART IS
THAT HE'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.111
TONY AND JOON
ARE NOT DETECT IVES.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.572
THEY HAD NO BUSINESS
BEING THERE.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.440
- WHAT ELSE COULD WE DO--THEY'RE
GROWN MEN WITH FREE WILL.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.242
- THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
LEI-T UNSAID.

30:26.290 --> 30:27.712
ALL THOSE YEARS
OF RADIO SILENCE...

30:27.750 --> 30:30.082
I WISH I HAD A CHANCE TO TELL
THEM HOW I TRULY FELT.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.656
- YOU HAVE HAD COUNTLESS
OPPORTUNITIES

30:31.690 --> 30:33.055
IN THE LAST 48 HOURS ALONE.

30:33.090 --> 30:34.227
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE?

30:34.260 --> 30:35.352
YOU SHOULD HAVE SANG THAT SONG

30:35.400 --> 30:37.868
YOU CAME UP WITH
FOR OUR HIGH SCHOOL.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.925
SAME ONE YOU SANG FOR
THE PRINCIPAL IN THE BATHROOM.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.835
- STOP. THAT'S FROM LEAN ON ME,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

30:41.870 --> 30:43.428
AND DON'T ACT LIKE YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT THOSE GUYS.

30:43.470 --> 30:45.006
THE ONLY REASON WHY
YOU TOOK THIS CASE

30:45.040 --> 30:49.477
IS BECAUSE YOU WERE JEALOUS
AND WANTED TO SING IN OUR GROUP.

30:49.510 --> 30:51.341
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

30:51.380 --> 30:54.474
I'LL ADMIT THE THOUGHT
MAY HAVE CROSSED MY MIND

30:54.520 --> 30:56.340
VERY BRIEFLY.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.517
THE TRUTH IS,

30:58.550 --> 31:00.689
I TOOK THIS CASE
BECAUSE I GOT FREAKED

31:00.720 --> 31:01.812
THAT YOU COULD HAVE
A FALLING OUT WITH DUDES

31:01.860 --> 31:03.350
THAT USED TO BE SO CLOSE TO YOU.

31:03.390 --> 31:04.687
AND I FIGURED IF IT COULD
HAPPEN TO YOU GUYS,

31:04.730 --> 31:05.788
THEN IT COULD HAPPEN TO US.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.286
- SHAWN, DON'T YOU REALIZE

31:07.330 --> 31:08.922
THAT NONE OF THE MYRIAD
OF STUPID, SELFISH,

31:08.960 --> 31:10.518
AND ULTIMATELY
LIFE-THREATENING STUNTS

31:10.560 --> 31:12.369
YOU PULLED OVER
THE LAST FOUR YEARS COULD DO IT?

31:12.400 --> 31:15.233
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.267
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.005
I MEAN, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HIDE YOU SOMEWHERE.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.498
- WELL...WHAT WOULD WE DO
IF WE WERE STILL ON THE CASE

31:23.540 --> 31:25.679
AND LOOKING FOR TONY
AND JOON?

31:25.710 --> 31:26.972
- WHATEVER DIDDLE WAS TRACKING,

31:27.010 --> 31:29.319
THE SECOND WAREHOUSE
ON HIS LIST IS PROBABLY NEXT,

31:29.350 --> 31:31.614
SO...WE THROW CAUTION
TO THE WIND,

31:31.650 --> 31:34.016
DRESS UP LIKE AMERICAN NINJAS,
AND CHECK IT OUT.

31:47.830 --> 31:49.388
- [whispers] I DON'T WANNA
GET SHOT, SHAWN.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.408
- JUST STAY LOW.
YOU'LL BE THE LOOKOUT.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.408
- GOOD. 'CAUSE I CAN LOOK OUT
FROM OUTSIDE.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.670
- GET BACK HERE!

31:59.580 --> 32:02.845
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

32:02.880 --> 32:05.110
- THERE'S ONE HAIR
ON MY KNUCKLE THAT'S LIKE...

32:05.150 --> 32:07.038
TWICE AS LONG
AS ALL THE OTHER ONES.

32:07.090 --> 32:09.354
- WHAT DO YOU SEE, SHAWN?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.152
- OH, DUDE.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.249
IT'S--IT'S SOME SORT OF
SECRET DEAL.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.619
WITH BRIEFCASES.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.423
IT LOOKS SUPER-SHADY.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.724
- HOW DID DIDDLE GET HIMSELF
MIXED UP IN ALL OF THAT?

32:19.770 --> 32:20.862
HE WAS THE SMARTEST,

32:20.900 --> 32:22.367
MOST RESPONSIBLE BROTHER
IN OUR GROUP.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.231
- OH...

32:24.270 --> 32:27.103
IT'S DRUGS.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.607
THIS IS ALL ABOUT DRUGS?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
THE WEIRD GUY
FROM THE FUNERAL IS HERE!

32:31.080 --> 32:32.809
- WHAT IS REVEREND WATKINS
DOING HERE?

32:32.850 --> 32:35.011
- IT'S NOT REVEREND WATKINS!
- WHO IS IT?

32:35.050 --> 32:38.349
- THE WEIRD GUY WITH THE SCAR.
HE LEI-T EARLY, I TOLD YOU.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.052
WOW. THAT'S A LOTTA DOUGH.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.388
MAN, THIS IS STRAIGHT OUT OF
TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.523
- ARE THEY DOING THE THING

32:44.560 --> 32:45.857
WHERE THEY PUT THEIR PINKY
IN THE BLOW

32:45.890 --> 32:47.482
AND TASTE IT
TO SEE IF IT'S GOOD?

32:47.530 --> 32:49.589
- HE JUST DID.
IT'S GOOD.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.291
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

32:51.330 --> 32:53.491
DUDE, HE DOUBLE-DIPPED.
- THAT'S UNSANITARY!

32:53.530 --> 32:54.861
- WELL, NOT IF IT'S FOR
HIS PERSONAL STASH.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.197
WE DON'T KNOW.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.333
- DO YOU SEE TONY AND JOON?
- NO, DON'T COME UP!

32:58.370 --> 33:00.759
THERE'S NOT ROOM
FOR YOU UP HERE!

33:00.810 --> 33:02.300
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

33:02.340 --> 33:05.138
BUT I BET ONE OF THESE B-HOLES
CAN LEAD US RIGHT TO THEM.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.375
I SAY WE GO BACK TO THE CAR,
WAIT,

33:07.410 --> 33:09.378
AND THEN FOLLOW
THE GUY WITH THE SCAR.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.513
- OKAY.
- THAT RHYMED.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.279
- [Gus's cell phone] HELLO.
- SHH!

33:13.320 --> 33:14.651
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HE HEARD THAT!

33:14.690 --> 33:16.385
- IT'S NOT ME. IT'S MY PHONE!
- HELLO.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.682
- WELL, TURN IT OFF.
- I'M TRYING TO.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.187
- WHO COULD POSSIBLY
BE CALLING YOU AT THIS--

33:19.230 --> 33:20.379
- HELLO.
- YOU ARE!

33:20.430 --> 33:21.852
HOW MANY TIMES DID I TELL YOU

33:21.900 --> 33:23.549
ABOUT PUTTING YOUR PHONE
IN YOUR BACK POCKET, SHAWN?

33:23.600 --> 33:26.421
- WHAT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

33:26.470 --> 33:28.495
OH, IT IS ME.
IT IS ME.

33:30.270 --> 33:34.138
- HEY, WHO ARE YOU?
- WHAT--

33:34.180 --> 33:38.002
- YOU MOVE, AND I PAINT THIS
WALL WITH YOUR BRAIN MATTER.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.405
NOW, WHO THE HELL SENT YOU?

33:40.450 --> 33:42.145
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE US
IF WE TOLD YOU.

33:42.180 --> 33:46.287
- YEAH? TRY ME.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.915
- MIKHAIL...DUDIKOFF.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.178
- RUSSIAN MOB?
- AMERICAN NINJAS.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.824
- [Gus's cell phone]
HELLO.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.143
[tires screeching]

34:18.250 --> 34:20.980
- GET IN THE CAR!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.852
- I DON'T WANNA GET
TORTURED, SHAWN.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.094
[door clicks open]

34:31.130 --> 34:33.963
[whimpering]

34:34.000 --> 34:35.092
both: [sh rilly] AAH!

34:35.140 --> 34:36.698
- SHUT UP!

34:36.740 --> 34:38.901
YOU TWO NUMBSKULLS
HAVE MANAGED TO STUMBLE

34:38.940 --> 34:41.135
INTO THE SINGLE BIGGEST
UNDERCOVER STING OPERATION

34:41.180 --> 34:42.374
IN THIS DEPARTMENT'S HISTORY!

34:42.410 --> 34:45.072
- WHERE ARE TONY AND JOON?

34:45.110 --> 34:48.238
[shrill screaming,
whimpering]

34:48.280 --> 34:50.168
- TONY AND JOON
ARE SAFE AND SOUND

34:50.220 --> 34:51.539
IN THE ROOM
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.717
JOON IS ON
HIS THIRD DOUGHNUT.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.957
THIS IS
DETECTIVE MOSES JOHNSON

34:55.990 --> 34:57.548
FROM NARCOTICS.

34:57.590 --> 34:58.727
HE'S OUR INSIDE MAN.

34:58.760 --> 35:02.457
WE SIMPLY COULDN'T RISK
EXPOSING HIM.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.468
- YOU TWO...

35:04.500 --> 35:06.718
SURE HAVE A PROPENSITY...

35:06.770 --> 35:11.036
FOR BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.977
- THANK YOU.

35:16.010 --> 35:17.329
IT'S A REFINED SKILL.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.541
- KEEPING TRACK OF YOU TWO
IS GETTING STICKY.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.775
THAT'S WHY WE SCOOPED UP
YOUR TWO FRIENDS.

35:21.820 --> 35:26.689
LAST NIGHT, YOU LITERALLY
LANDED IN THE LION'S DEN.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.109
I'LL BE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.478
- HOW...IN THE HELL

35:32.530 --> 35:34.225
COULD YOU NOT TELL US
ABOUT THIS?

35:34.260 --> 35:36.751
WE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS TEAM!
- WE SOLVE A MURDER A WEEK.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.290
WHY DID YOU LEAVE US
IN HERE ALL NIGHT?

35:38.330 --> 35:39.524
- IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN
PROTECTION.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.026
- WHAT IS ALL OF THIS ABOUT,

35:41.070 --> 35:42.992
AND WHAT DID DIDDLE
GET HIMSELF INTO?

35:43.040 --> 35:45.099
- THE SBPD USES
UNDISCLOSED WAREHOUSES

35:45.140 --> 35:46.732
TO STORE THE CACHES
OF DRUGS AND WEAPONS

35:46.770 --> 35:47.998
THEY SEIZE FROM BUSTS.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.600
THE STREET VALUE ON THIS
CONTRABAND IS ASTRONOMICAL.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.244
SOMEBODY CRACKED
OUR NETWORK SYSTEM,

35:52.280 --> 35:53.770
DISCOVERED THE LOCATION
OF THE WAREHOUSES,

35:53.810 --> 35:55.471
AND STOLE
THE CONFISCATED DRUGS.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.841
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
WAS UNDERCOVER AS A DRUG LORD

35:57.880 --> 36:00.087
TRYING TO MAKE A SCORE.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.678
- DIDDLE WORKED FOR CYBERVAULT.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.278
THEY PROTECT
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS,

36:03.320 --> 36:05.959
TRADE SECRETS,
CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.423
- OH, I CAN SEE IT.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.827
SBPD CONTRACTS CYBERVAULT
TO DO THEIR NETWORK SECURITY.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.760
IT'S PROBABLY
THEIR SINGLE BIGGEST ACCOUNT.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.768
- WE DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION
UNTIL YOU CAME TO US

36:14.800 --> 36:16.961
SAYING THAT YOUR FRIEND'S
DEATH WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.299
- AH...
DIDDLE DISCOVERED

36:20.340 --> 36:22.729
A WORKAROUND
IN HIS COMPANY'S CODE...

36:22.780 --> 36:24.771
ONE THAT WOULD ALLOW
SOMEONE TO ACCESS

36:24.810 --> 36:28.541
ANY OF THEIR CLIENTS' PROTECTED
NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.377
HE TRIED TO TAKE IT
TO HIS SUPERVISOR,

36:30.420 --> 36:31.842
GOT BLOWN OFF,

36:31.890 --> 36:35.485
AND THEN HE WENT AND FOLLOWED
THE EVIDENCE FOR HIMSELF.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.454
- YOUR BUDDY WAS ONE
SMART COOKIE, GUSTER.

36:37.490 --> 36:39.549
HE GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE RAT

36:39.590 --> 36:41.820
TO CATCH HIM MAKING THE DEAL
WITH THE BAD GUY ON VIDEO.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.589
WHICH IS WHAT WE THINK
HE ATTACHED TO THE EMAIL.

36:43.630 --> 36:46.667
- YEAH. HE ALSO MANAGED
TO GET HIMSELF KILLED.

36:46.700 --> 36:48.429
- TONY AND JOON GAVE US
THE ENCRYPTED FILE.

36:48.470 --> 36:50.597
WE'VE HAD ONE OF OUR BEST
TECHIES WORKING ON IT ALL DAY

36:50.640 --> 36:52.460
WITH NO LUCK AS OF YET.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.239
THEY'VE TRIED EVERY
DECRYPTION ALGORITHM.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.599
I'M REALLY SORRY, GUS.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.131
YOUR FRIEND LEONARD REALLY
SEEMED LIKE A STAND-UP GUY.

37:03.150 --> 37:05.618
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

37:05.650 --> 37:07.686
- GUS.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.017
- OH, MAN!

37:09.060 --> 37:12.518
[laughter, whooping]

37:12.560 --> 37:14.357
- OH, MAN, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.924
- MAN, WE THOUGHT
WE WAS DEAD FOR SURE.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.269
TONY STARTED PRAYING OUT LOUD
IN THE BACK OF THE CAR,

37:18.300 --> 37:20.268
SO THEN THE SCARY SUGAR HILL
DUDE WITH THE SCAR

37:20.300 --> 37:21.836
WAS LIKE, "SHUT THE HELL UP
BACK THERE!"

37:21.870 --> 37:23.189
TELL 'EM WHAT I SAID
AI-TER THAT.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.105
- SO THEN YOU SAID--
- I SAID, "MAN, DON'T YOU KNOW

37:25.140 --> 37:26.767
WHEN IT'S TIME TO KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT?"

37:26.810 --> 37:28.368
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

37:28.410 --> 37:30.674
I WAS THINKING WORDS IN MY HEAD,
BUT I WASN'T SAYING THEM.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.302
SEE? IN MY MIND, I WAS LIKE...

37:32.350 --> 37:33.908
NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE EVER HAPPENED

37:33.950 --> 37:35.679
IF WE WOULD HAVE JUST GOT
THE GROUP BACK TOGETHER

37:35.720 --> 37:37.278
LIKE DIDDLE
ALWAYS WANTED US TO.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.685
RIGHT?

37:41.390 --> 37:43.449
- HE SURE LOVED
HIS MUSIC, THOUGH.

37:43.490 --> 37:46.459
- [humming Boyz II Men's
It's So Hard To Say Good-bye]

37:46.490 --> 37:48.856
- SO THEN WHEN THE BAD DUDE
WITH THE GUN WAS LIKE,

37:48.900 --> 37:51.255
"SHUT UP!"
I WAS JUST LIKE...

37:51.300 --> 37:53.962
BECAUSE MY MAMA TAUGHT ME
FROM A VERY EARLY AGE

37:54.000 --> 37:56.389
VERY EARLY AGE--
I WOULD SAY FOUR, FIVE, OR SIX--

37:56.440 --> 37:59.102
SHE WAS LIKE,
"ALL YOU NEED IN THIS WORLD--

37:59.140 --> 38:01.062
BASIC MORALS,
VALUES, AND RESPECT."

38:01.110 --> 38:03.999
- [continues humming]
JOON, SHUT UP!

38:04.040 --> 38:05.507
IT'S SO HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.279
DIDDLE GAVE US
EVERYTHING WE NEEDED.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.517
I GOTTA SEE THE ENCRYPTION
ON THIS FILE.

38:09.550 --> 38:12.519
YOU GUYS...
WARM UP YOUR VOICES.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.518
- FOLLOW ME!

38:15.820 --> 38:17.959
- HEY.
- NOT NOW, SPENCER.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.855
- NO, I THINK I GOT IT.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.790
I'VE RUN EVERY ALGORITHM
IMAGINABLE.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.354
THERE ARE FOUR
SEPARATE LOCKS,

38:23.400 --> 38:24.697
AND I CAN'T SEE
A PATTERN ANWVHERE HERE.

38:24.730 --> 38:25.958
- IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.797
IT'S ABOUT
WHAT YOU CAN'T HEAR--MAY I?

38:27.830 --> 38:29.434
- UH, BE MY GUEST.
- FELLAS.

38:29.470 --> 38:31.062
IT'S SO HARD TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.376
JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS,
MINUS THE HAIR AND SATIN.

38:34.410 --> 38:37.004
a||: * IT'S SO HARD

38:37.040 --> 38:40.441
* TO SAY GOOD-BYE

38:40.480 --> 38:45.417
* TO YESTERDAY

38:45.450 --> 38:47.441
- BOB'S YOUR UNCLE.
IT'S WORKING!

38:47.490 --> 38:48.514
- WHY CAN'T WE GET
THE LAST STRIP?

38:48.560 --> 38:50.187
- THERE WERE FOUR OF US, SHAWN.

38:50.220 --> 38:51.357
WE'RE MISSING THE HARMONY.
- I GOT IT!

38:51.390 --> 38:52.721
I'LL DO IT.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.920
[clears throat]

38:53.960 --> 38:57.418
- * IT'S SO HARD

38:57.460 --> 39:00.520
* TO SAY GOOD-BYE

39:00.570 --> 39:04.563
* TO YESTERDAY

39:06.740 --> 39:09.607
- * OOH OOH OOH

39:16.150 --> 39:17.913
- OH, THAT CAN'T BE.

39:17.950 --> 39:19.611
- WAIT A SECOND.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.459
- THAT'S THE RAT?
- WHO IS THAT?

39:21.490 --> 39:23.014
- LET'S GO!

39:23.060 --> 39:24.618
[group screams]

39:26.090 --> 39:27.751
- BABIES.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.200
- CHELSEA PATTERSON.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.242
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.511
- WHAT IS THIS...
JOHN SLADE?

39:51.550 --> 39:52.881
- IT'S THE END
OF THE ROAD, CHELSEA.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.911
- LEONARD DISCOVERED THE LEAK
IN YOUR SECURITY CODE

39:54.960 --> 39:56.484
AND REPORTED IT
TO YOUR SUPERVISOR WHO,

39:56.520 --> 39:58.385
AS ALWAYS,
PASSED IT OFF TO YOU.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.886
- COPY.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.592
- BUT UNLIKE MY GOOD FRIEND,
YOU DIDN'T DO THE NOBLE THING

40:02.630 --> 40:05.098
AND DECIDED
TO TRY AND GET YOURS.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.431
- YOU USED THE LEAK
TO ACQUIRE THE LOCATIONS

40:09.470 --> 40:11.938
OF THE SBPD
CONTRABAND WAREHOUSES

40:11.970 --> 40:15.098
AND THEN SOLD THAT INFORMATION
TO A DRUG KINGPIN.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.200
- DIDDLE CAUGHT IT
ALL ON CAMERA.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.512
- HE WASN'T CREEPILY
CHECKING OUT YOUR POSTERIOR.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.689
- THAT'S NOT CREEPY AT ALL.
- HE WAS INVESTIGATING YOU.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.915
- YOU FELT HORRIBLE THAT YOUR
BACK DOOR DEALINGS

40:26.950 --> 40:29.282
LED TO HIS DEATH, BY BUT THEN
THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.527
- AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
THOSE SAME DRUG DEALERS

40:31.560 --> 40:33.778
WENT Al-TER GUS,
TONY, AND JOON.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.355
- I'M OFFICIALLY
CANCELING DRINKS.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.799
PROBABLY.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.627
- NOBODY
WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HURT.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.594
LEAST OF ALL LEONARD.
I'M SORRY.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.200
- YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.800
IN FACT, WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CUT INTO SOME OF THAT

40:47.840 --> 40:49.899
IF YOU WERE TO NAME SOME NAMES

40:49.940 --> 40:51.874
AND LEAD US TO YOUR ASSOCIATES.

40:51.910 --> 40:55.243
- DO IT FOR DIDDLE.
- OKAY.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.681
[sobbing]

40:58.720 --> 41:00.210
- NICE WORK, GUYS.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.957
- NO THANKS TO YOU.
ESPECIALLY YOU.

41:02.990 --> 41:05.458
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T
LET US IN ON THIS, MAN.

41:05.490 --> 41:07.355
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL
ON THE SAME TEAM HERE.

41:07.390 --> 41:10.757
- YOU ARE NOT A COP, SPENCER.
YOU NEVER WILL BE.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.538
- THANK GOD FOR THAT, B.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.546
- * WE CAN
- * CAN CAN CAN

41:24.580 --> 41:27.208
- * TO SEE FOREVER
- * FOREVER

41:28.580 --> 41:30.810
- HEY, I HEARD S-SINGING.
I THOUGHT I HEARD SOME SINGING.

41:30.850 --> 41:32.386
WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:32.420 --> 41:34.285
- OH, WELL, TONY'S COUSIN'S
GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK,

41:34.320 --> 41:36.857
AND ONE OF THE SINGERS FELL OUT,
SO WE'RE STEPPING IN.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.187
- WE NEED A FOURTH.

41:38.220 --> 41:40.029
- YEAH. ONLY QUESTION IS,
ARE YOU DOWN?

41:40.060 --> 41:41.527
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

41:41.560 --> 41:43.619
- WITH SHAWN PART OF THE GROUP,
WE CAN'T GO BY OUR OLD NAME.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.695
BLACKAPELLA?
- NAW.

41:44.730 --> 41:45.867
- TRUE, THAT.

41:45.900 --> 41:46.992
- UH, I'VE...

41:47.030 --> 41:49.294
ACTUALLY GIVEN THIS
SOME THOUGHT.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.092
I THINK I GOT IT.
- WHAT?

41:51.140 --> 41:53.199
- QUARTERBLACK.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.435
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, SHAWN.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.402
- IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE, GUS.
IT'S JUST MATH.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.907
THERE'S ONE OF ME
AND THERE'S THREE OF YOU.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.043
- QUARTERBLACK WOULD BE ONE
BLACK DUDE AND THREE WHITE GUYS.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.342
- NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

42:02.380 --> 42:03.847
I LIKE THE RING OF THAT.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.484
QUARTERBLACK.
- YEAH.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.317
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL...

42:07.350 --> 42:08.886
RANDALL CUNNINGHAMS.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.558
- THREE TO ONE.
I THINK THAT'S SETTLED, RIGHT?

42:10.590 --> 42:11.887
QUARTERBLACK IT IS.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.249
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
WE DON'T VOTE.

42:13.290 --> 42:16.088
- OH. WELL, WHO THINKS
WE SHOULD START VOTING?

42:16.130 --> 42:17.757
- SHAWN...

42:17.800 --> 42:19.495
- WHO'S HUNGRY?

42:19.530 --> 42:21.930
- WHO THINKS GUS SHOULD PAY?

42:21.970 --> 42:24.461
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M OUT.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.
