WEBVTT

00:56.765 --> 00:57.974
Sorry I'm late.

00:58.684 --> 01:02.145
That's okay. l was occupied.
How are you today, Don?

01:02.479 --> 01:05.022
l'm well, Connie. Thank you. How are you?

01:05.107 --> 01:09.068
l'm afraid l have some serious business
to discuss. Have a seat.

01:17.911 --> 01:22.415
l was at McCann Erickson yesterday,
and they let me know

01:23.500 --> 01:27.336
that effective January 1
they're buying Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.046
What?

01:29.840 --> 01:32.925
l'm sorry, but that means
l'm going to have to move

01:33.010 --> 01:36.179
-my New York properties elsewhere.
-Why?

01:36.930 --> 01:41.350
Because P.P.L. owns Sterling Cooper.
You're all gonna be part of McCann.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.357
-So we're all gone.
-Sterling... l don't know.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.028
Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.

01:52.780 --> 01:56.616
But you're a prize pig.
You'll make more money, pick up stock.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.118
You won't have to live and die
with every account.

01:59.203 --> 02:03.539
Bullshit. lt's a sausage factory.
l turned them down three years ago.

02:06.168 --> 02:09.587
This happens all the time, Don.
lt's business.

02:10.214 --> 02:13.341
l'd ask them to put you
on the Caribbean hotels,

02:13.425 --> 02:16.135
but l don't think
l'm gonna stay there much longer.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.597
-You come and go as you please.
-Yes, l do.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.685
And you don't give a crap that my future
is tied up in this mess because of you?

02:24.770 --> 02:28.481
You wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.359
And you wanted to play with me.

02:31.443 --> 02:35.404
Kick me around, knock me down to size
while you called me "son."

02:37.866 --> 02:40.952
l get it now, Connie. lt's business.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.625
You know,

02:49.795 --> 02:53.714
l got everything l have on my own.

02:54.967 --> 02:59.345
lt's made me immune to those
who complain and cry because they can't.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.434
l didn't take you for one of them, Don.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.396
Are you?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.492
-Some other time we'll try again.
-Yes.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.620
Have a nice holiday.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.813
Sixty-nine cents a bushel.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.984
-That's half last year.
-We ain't gonna make it.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.279
lt's as fair a shake as we could get,

03:58.363 --> 04:01.449
considering that Allotment Act
made no allotment for wheat.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.367
You were supposed to get us a good deal.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.537
There's a surplus.
What the hell's he supposed to do?

04:06.622 --> 04:09.832
-Well, l ain't selling at that.
-You've got no choice.

04:09.917 --> 04:15.755
Sure l do. l've got a silo.
Store it till winter when the price goes up.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.299
-How you gonna pay your mortgage?
-That's none of your concern.

04:18.383 --> 04:22.929
-Settle down. We're all in this together.
-No, we ain't, thanks to you.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.726
-l take care of mine. You take care of yours.
-Damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.019
No more.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.150
Now get out of my kitchen.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.628
What's so urgent that you had to wake me?

04:55.796 --> 04:59.757
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L.
is being sold and us along with it.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.012
-So you knew about this?
-No, but it makes sense.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.683
-All that short-term thinking.
-So what do we do?

05:10.978 --> 05:16.023
There's nothing to do. l have a contract.
You have a contract. Roger has a contract.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.733
So that's it?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.111
You're losing your business
and you don't care?

05:20.195 --> 05:23.906
-l lost my business last year.
-Well, do something about it.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.662
lf Sterling Cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P.P.L.?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.164
We could put everything back
the way it was.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.335
Young men love risk because
they can't imagine the consequences.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.754
And you old men love
building golden tombs

05:38.839 --> 05:43.968
and sealing the rest of us in with you.
You're done. You know that, right?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.887
So l should just throw away my fortune?

05:46.972 --> 05:50.099
l don't have the rest of my life
to earn it back.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.145
-l understand. l'll let you get back to sleep.
-Why do you care?

05:54.271 --> 05:57.231
Because l'm sick of being batted around
like a ping-pong ball.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.693
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch of
accountants trying to make $1 into $1 .1 0?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.738
l want to work.
l want to build something of my own.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.825
How do you not understand that?
You did it yourself 40 years ago.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.952
That's true.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.124
But l'm not sure you have a stomach
for the realities.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.917
Try me.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.630
Well, we're gonna need accounts.

06:22.424 --> 06:26.552
American Tobacco, that's most
of Sterling Cooper, but that's Roger.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.388
l understand that.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.976
Did Hilton tell you when this blessed event
is supposed to take place?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.644
New Year's Day.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.985
-We have to talk to Roger now.
-You talk to him.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.821
Do you want to do this or not?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.867
Honey...

06:51.078 --> 06:55.289
Honey, he probably feels bad about
the president getting shot on his watch.

06:55.373 --> 06:59.251
Now, stop reading the paper.
She's obsessed.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.546
lt's the most interest that girl's ever had
in a book depository.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.007
McCann is buying P.P.L.,

07:05.759 --> 07:08.928
and is absorbing Sterling Cooper
along with it.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.015
-What?
-Conrad Hilton told me this morning.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.353
Christ. From one john's bed to the next.
What a joke.

07:18.063 --> 07:22.316
Don and l have been discussing the idea
that we buy the company back.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.570
-Really? Why?
-Because we don't want to go to McCann.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.497
And now you're sniffing around
because l have a golden pork chop

07:36.581 --> 07:38.457
dangling from my neck.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.545
lt's more than that.
You know Bert's done for.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.964
Now it's about Bert, huh?

07:45.048 --> 07:47.800
l want to see what you look like
with your tail between your legs.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.719
You sold your birthright
so you could marry that trollop.

07:50.804 --> 07:55.057
Here we go. This is your pitch?
Well, move along.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.103
l'm not gonna throw it all away because
he doesn't want to work at McCann.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.729
You want to work there?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.315
You don't value what l do
any more than they do.

08:03.400 --> 08:08.821
l was wrong. l learned that with Hilton.
l can sell ideas, but l'm not an account man.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.699
You're not good at relationships,
because you don't value them.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.451
-l value my relationship with you.
-You do now.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.619
l do.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.586
l'm sorry. l've got points, stock.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.297
lf l'm useless, so be it.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.592
There's a deck chair somewhere
with my name on it.

08:31.887 --> 08:36.098
You're right, Roger. lf you've lost
your appetite, you should retire.

08:36.933 --> 08:41.395
Of course, l've seen that before.
So have you. Men my age, even younger,

08:41.479 --> 08:46.233
they play golf, go on vacation,
lose their appetite.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.111
ln three years...

08:51.323 --> 08:56.035
Join or die?
Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.748
-You know it's true.
-You're still gonna outlive me.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.919
We have to try.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.217
So you do want to be
in advertising after all.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.640
Go upstairs.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.893
-Daddy just got home.
-l'll be up.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.488
-Do you want me to go, too?
-Please sit down.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.419
l made an appointment
with a divorce attorney,

09:47.504 --> 09:49.755
and l suggest you do the same.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.177
Come on, Betts.
What are you doing seeing a lawyer?

09:55.637 --> 09:59.640
l want to be civilized about this.
Please don't act surprised.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.726
You haven't been yourself.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.272
Maybe you need to see a doctor.
A good one this time.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.483
Because l'd have to be sick
to want out of this?

10:10.902 --> 10:14.321
You've had a tough couple of weeks.
We all have.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.037
l've had a tough year.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.292
l felt l should tell you rather
than just let you get a phone call at work.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.545
Well, forget it.
l'm not gonna let you break up this family.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.880
l didn't break up this family.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.485
Lane, please shut the door and have a seat.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.905
Certainly.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.999
We know McCann Erickson bought P.P.L.,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.835
and we know that makes
Sterling Cooper chattel.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.170
Who told you that?

11:11.254 --> 11:14.006
Someone outside of this building
who knows.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.424
Well, they're wrong.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.677
Lane, we've worked next to each other
for a year.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.805
Don't act like a stranger. We've got tea.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.063
Well, l suppose
you'll find out soon enough,

11:29.272 --> 11:31.732
but your information
isn't completely correct.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.612
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold.
P.P.L., well, will remain P.P.L.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.532
That doesn't change our plans.
We want to buy back the company.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.244
We're willing to offer
the purchase price plus 1 2%.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.416
-lt's worth more than that now.
-What did you get?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.877
l'm not going to say, but more than that.

11:51.961 --> 11:56.548
l apologize you had to find out this way.
Believe me, it wasn't my decision.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.972
l've quite enjoyed it here.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.066
Well, they've only got me for a year.
You for what? Three?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.360
We'll make another run at it.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.824
The only grounds for divorce in this state
are absence of a spouse,

12:21.908 --> 12:25.119
incurable insanity,
life imprisonment or adultery.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.413
Well, he hasn't been faithful.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.332
Do you have any witnesses
or corroboration?

12:30.834 --> 12:31.875
Not really.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.379
lt wouldn't matter anyway,
with both parties at fault.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.716
-No. We haven't... We aren't...
-Ken. Ken, what are you doing?

12:40.677 --> 12:44.388
You think the governor needs
another scandal on the ticket?

12:45.348 --> 12:49.059
l am sorry for presuming, Mrs. Draper.
That was wrong.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.773
-So what do l do?
-l know it's hard to understand,

12:54.858 --> 12:57.943
but the state of New York
doesn't want anyone to get divorced.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.988
That's why people go to Reno. lt's painless.

13:02.157 --> 13:06.660
l met my second wife. You stay there
for six weeks to establish residency.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.372
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,
just consent.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.916
l see.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.545
We need to discuss what you want
in terms of settlement.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.799
-Whatever l'm entitled to.
-Give us a second.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.393
-You don't need what he can provide.
-Henry, l have three children.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.730
l'll take care of them,
and l'll take care of you.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.900
l don't want you owing him anything.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.159
We want to get this done
as soon as possible.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.496
-Saint John, l'm glad l caught you.
-What is it?

13:51.289 --> 13:54.124
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper
have learned of the sale.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.628
-What do they know?
-It was a mixture of truth and half truth.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.796
They knew about McCann,
but they were under the belief

13:59.881 --> 14:02.257
that P.P.L. was being sold as well.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.593
-And what did you tell them?
-That they were wrong.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.137
They even wanted to bid
for Sterling Cooper.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.264
1 2% above our purchase price.

14:12.185 --> 14:17.189
Listen, l apologize, Lane.
Obviously the news is getting out.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.109
-What news?
-P.P.L. is being sold as well.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.781
What? Why wasn't l told?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.910
Didn't seem pertinent. Trying to keep
our company calm as well as theirs.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.664
-Well, where's my place in this?
-With McCann, I suppose.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.253
There, there, Lane. They know
you're essential to the transition.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.339
-And then what?
-You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.132
You always do.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.969
Lane.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.807
-Yes?
-Don't be disheartened.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.103
-l'll put in a good word for you.
-Thank you.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.689
No, thank you.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.066
We've got a month till winter,
then we'll be set.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.361
This is what l showed the man
from the bank today.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.114
What are they gonna do? Sell this place?

15:49.198 --> 15:52.367
The bank's gonna get their payday
right after me.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.370
We got nothing,
and we're about to have less.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.081
Fine! l'll sell.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.919
l'll sell my crop for nothing. Dick.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.090
-What are you doing?
-l'll drive it to Chicago tonight.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.009
You're drunk.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.225
Go. He can barely stand.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.229
Calm down.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.566
Whoa! Here.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.402
Calm down.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.199
lt ain't gonna rain.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.928
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.882
Your guests have arrived.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.679
Close the door. Have a seat.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.307
-What's he doing here?
-You're gonna read us your will?

17:39.392 --> 17:42.102
-l want the Cadillac.
-l couldn't sleep.

17:42.979 --> 17:46.231
And l thought,
why don't we go to McCann directly?

17:46.607 --> 17:49.609
-Because you can't. lt's done.
-You're not even gonna ask?

17:49.694 --> 17:51.319
l did, yesterday.

17:52.321 --> 17:57.367
And you were right. P.P.L. is being sold,
so it seems we're all going to McCann.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.870
They cut you loose.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.622
l want you to find out
what the price was and give us a shot.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.752
Enough. l should fire you for even trying
to involve me in this conspiracy.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.795
Go ahead.
lt's the only thing you did well here.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.048
-Don, let it go.
-l did a great many things here.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.888
Have another. lt's 9:30, for God's sake.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.434
Jesus, that's right.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.564
You have absolute authority to fire anyone.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.068
Fire us.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.741
Fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.204
-Can you do that?
-Why would l?

18:42.705 --> 18:44.122
Because once this sale goes through,

18:44.207 --> 18:47.626
you'll be thrown overboard, and you'll be
a corpse knocking against their hull.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.920
Nothing good ever came
from seeking revenge.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.547
Nonsense. We'll make you a partner.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.887
l should think this is worth more than that.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.973
So we're negotiating.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.143
-We'll put your name on the door.
-l don't know.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.230
-Do you know how to do what he does?
-l don't.

19:15.738 --> 19:21.660
lt could be done, but getting you, us,
out of here isn't the difficult part.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.914
-We need accounts.
-Let's say we have Lucky Strike.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.127
And although that's, let's see,
$23 million in billings...

19:31.212 --> 19:32.587
Twenty-four.

19:33.089 --> 19:37.634
-We'd still need another third for cash flow.
-Well, l can't take anyone else

19:37.718 --> 19:41.847
or Lee Garner, Sr. won't think
that he's special. What about Hilton?

19:42.056 --> 19:44.933
-No.
-Can we get any of our other accounts?

19:45.434 --> 19:46.935
We'll get them.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.690
lf l were to send a telex in at noon today
that you've all been sacked,

19:51.774 --> 19:53.358
it's after close of business in London.

19:53.442 --> 19:57.904
lt would remain unnoticed
until Monday morning there, 2:00 a.m. here.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.075
That gives us today and the weekend
to first gather accounts

20:02.159 --> 20:07.372
and then a skeleton staff to service them.
And of course we would have to obtain

20:07.456 --> 20:10.834
all the materials required
for continuity of service.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.837
Obtain? We have to steal everything.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.842
Anyone approached must be a certainty.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.554
lf news spreads, they'll lock us out.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.477
Do we vote or something?

20:35.151 --> 20:39.195
Well, gentlemen, l suppose you're fired.

20:42.158 --> 20:46.119
We'll, it's official.
Friday, December 1 3th, 1 963.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.998
Four guys shot their own legs off.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.586
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requested
an office-wide memo.

20:54.670 --> 20:59.090
"The office is closed this weekend.
All work suspended. Carpet cleaning."

20:59.175 --> 21:02.302
-Can you get me Mr. Campbell?
-He didn't come in today. He's sick.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.555
Call his house. lt's important.
Peggy, my office.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.894
What do l bring?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.942
Shut the door. Sit down.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.908
l know we have to roll out Western Union
by New Year's.

21:24.992 --> 21:29.245
-l don't have art. There's no one there.
-They're selling the company.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.375
-Again?
-l'm starting a new agency.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.877
l need you here Sunday evening
to get your things

21:35.962 --> 21:39.005
and to help us collect
whatever accounts we end up taking.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.548
-Really?
-Yes.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.220
-Who else is going?
-Why do you need to know that?

21:45.680 --> 21:48.515
-Because it's important.
-l can't tell you.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.519
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann.
Do you know what that means?

21:52.603 --> 21:55.397
You just assume l'll do whatever you say.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.943
Just follow you like some nervous poodle.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.073
-l'm not gonna beg you.
-Beg me? You didn't even ask me.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.202
Fine, l'm asking you.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.164
l've had other offers, you know,

22:13.916 --> 22:17.002
that came with a sales pitch
about opportunity.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.714
Everyone thinks you do all my work.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.591
Even you.

22:28.180 --> 22:33.101
l don't want to make a career out of being
there so you can kick me when you fail.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.273
-l guess l'll have to talk to Kurt and Smitty.
-l guess so.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.289
-Where the hell are my pajamas?
-Will you please relax?

22:55.499 --> 22:59.377
Trudy, l called in sick today
because l had my interview with Ogilvy.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.671
-l have to look sick.
-You do.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.602
-What a pleasant surprise.
-Sorry to drop in.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.647
-How are you?
-Better than my husband.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.735
And how are you?
We've been calling all day.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.321
-May l take your coats?
-We're fine.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.409
l'm going to change the sheets.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.925
-ls everything okay?
-McCann bought P.P.L., and us.

23:48.010 --> 23:52.347
-What? Again?
-We need to talk to you. lt's serious.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.891
We're not firing you.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.312
Am l getting a few more adjectives
added to my title?

24:00.022 --> 24:04.609
-Don't bother. l have other plans.
-Peter, may l speak to you for a moment?

24:07.655 --> 24:12.367
Pete, we're starting a new agency.
We're here to talk to you about joining us.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.913
Wait a minute. They're letting you go?

24:17.456 --> 24:20.458
Keep it to yourself,
but l'm taking American Tobacco.

24:20.543 --> 24:24.712
We need another 7-1 0 million in billings
for cash flow or something.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.799
What do you have
in your saddlebag so far?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.886
l don't have a saddlebag.
l don't know what you're talking about.

24:32.555 --> 24:36.808
Pete, l don't blame you for bailing out,
the way you've been treated.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.354
-So Kenny turned you down?
-We haven't spoken to Ken yet.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.817
And yes, we want your accounts,
but we also want your talent.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.237
Really? And what are my talents?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.990
-You'll do what it takes.
-No.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.327
l want to hear it from him.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.335
lt's not hard for me to say, Pete.
You saw this coming. We didn't.

25:06.088 --> 25:09.090
ln fact, you've been ahead
on a lot of things.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.261
Aeronautics, teenagers, the negro market...

25:14.972 --> 25:17.682
We need you to keep us looking forward.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.769
l do, anyway.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.276
l want to be a partner,
and l want my name in the lobby.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.989
There's not gonna be a lobby.

25:40.080 --> 25:45.585
North American Aviation, Secor Laxatives,
Gillette, jai alai, maybe Pampers.

25:46.462 --> 25:50.715
That's close to 8 million already.
l don't think you get conditions.

25:51.425 --> 25:54.469
We'll make you a partner
if you can deliver by Sunday.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.762
Sunday?

25:56.055 --> 26:00.975
We'll leave the name and the title as a goal.
Like it or not, that works with you.

26:02.144 --> 26:06.940
l'd like to say l'll think about it,
but l don't think that's an option, is it?

26:13.864 --> 26:15.657
l'm not really sick.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.828
Welcome aboard.

26:24.875 --> 26:28.127
-Good night, Trudy.
-Good night, gentlemen.

26:28.837 --> 26:32.215
-What if l come up short?
-That's not an option.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.260
Good night.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.936
l want you to call Hubert Adams at Secor.
His number's in my Rolodex.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.897
l threw it under the bed. Try him at home.

26:48.816 --> 26:52.860
Tell him l'll meet him at the St. Regis at 7:30
and sound like a secretary.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.862
l have to get dressed.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.372
-l can't believe he was gonna leave.
-That little shit.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.003
Look, they still have a picture
of Kennedy up.

27:10.713 --> 27:15.133
Although, what are they gonna do?
Take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?

27:16.218 --> 27:17.885
Not in this place.

27:19.054 --> 27:23.558
l've acted like l've started a business
my whole life, but l inherited it.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.354
l need an attorney.

27:30.858 --> 27:34.319
-Divorce.
-So it's true, huh?

27:37.114 --> 27:40.033
-What are you talking about?
-Henry Francis.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.204
-Who?
-Jesus.

27:47.374 --> 27:51.961
-Right when things were almost normal.
-l need you to tell me what you know.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.256
Margaret's friends with his daughter.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.760
-Are they sleeping together?
-l don't know.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.640
lt came from his daughter.
He talks about her.

28:06.685 --> 28:11.564
lt sounds like it's serious.
l was gonna tell you. No, l wasn't.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.941
l thought you knew.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.821
l'm sorry l told you. Believe me.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.505
l am sorry about that.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.431
Wake up.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.268
-He's sleeping.
-l don't care.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.604
Who the hell is Henry Francis?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.192
No one.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.321
-Stop it. Stop it!
-Who the hell is he?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.117
-Why do you care?
-Because you're good,

29:04.201 --> 29:06.536
and everyone else in the world is bad.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.830
-You're drunk.
-You're so hurt.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.958
So brave with your little white nose
in the air.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.503
-All along you've been building a life raft.
-Get out.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.006
-You never forgave me.
-Forgave what?

29:20.968 --> 29:24.679
-That l've never been enough?
-You got everything you ever wanted.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.764
Everything! And you loved it.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.517
And now l'm not good enough
for some spoiled mainline brat?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.060
That's right!

29:32.980 --> 29:34.856
You won't get a nickel.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.027
And l'll take the kids.
God knows they'll be better off.

29:40.571 --> 29:41.988
l'm going to Reno,

29:42.072 --> 29:44.574
and you're going to consent,
and that's the end of this.

29:44.658 --> 29:48.202
Don't threaten me. l know all about you.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.373
You're a whore.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.544
You know that?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.274
l want you out of the house.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.160
Hold the elevator.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.585
-They called you in, too?
-Yes, they did.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.594
-l'll admit it. l'm a little scared.
-Of what?

30:48.805 --> 30:52.391
-Why are you here?
-l don't know. Cooper called me.

30:53.268 --> 30:57.522
First they're cleaning the carpets,
now they're not. Why are you here?

30:59.399 --> 31:00.483
Work.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.532
Hey, everybody, Harry Crane is here.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.410
Relax, Pete, we're expecting him.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.080
-What's going on?
-Why are you here?

31:15.457 --> 31:17.542
l'm sorry, what's going on?

31:18.669 --> 31:21.295
P.P.L. has been sold to McCann.
We're starting a new agency.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.590
We'd like you to join us
as our new head of media.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.972
-Are you kidding?
-Yes. Yes, we are. Happy birthday.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.183
We need your answer.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.231
-l should really call my wife.
-Mr. Crane... Harry.

31:41.692 --> 31:46.904
This matter is secret and time-sensitive.
lf you turned us down and elect to be

31:46.989 --> 31:51.659
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,

31:52.494 --> 31:56.122
we'll have to lock you in the storeroom
until morning.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.875
l'm sure you understand.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.045
Pete.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.548
We were hoping
you could decipher these job sheets.

32:05.632 --> 32:09.343
-Where exactly are these materials?
-l never look at these.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.141
Can't we just take everything?

32:15.976 --> 32:18.519
That's good thinking,
but we don't know where anything is.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.730
No one knows how this works?

32:21.398 --> 32:23.316
Let me make a phone call.
l'll take care of this.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.360
-No. No more conspirators.
-l'll be discreet.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.032
Where's Don?

32:36.371 --> 32:37.872
What did we do?

32:39.666 --> 32:43.377
-Nothing.
-Then why are we in the living room?

32:45.839 --> 32:48.633
We want to tell you something, because...

32:49.259 --> 32:54.513
Well, it's going to be a little bit of a change.
Your father is going to be moving out.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.730
Now, we'll still be living here,
and he'll come to visit.

33:04.733 --> 33:08.110
-Then why is he going?
-Because...

33:14.785 --> 33:16.744
lt'll just be temporary.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.914
-Like when you lived in the hotel?
-Yes.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.166
lt'll be different.

33:25.921 --> 33:30.341
-ls it because l lost your cufflinks?
-No, it has nothing to do with you.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.096
That's not what l mean.

33:37.974 --> 33:42.395
-l love you both. You know that.
-Then why are you going?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.732
l'm not going.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.654
l'm just living elsewhere.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.949
That's going.
You say things and you don't mean them,

33:55.033 --> 33:58.202
-and you can't just do that.
-Sally, sweetheart.

33:59.121 --> 34:01.122
-Go away.
-Sally, stop it.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.292
You said you'd always come home.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.839
l will.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.135
lt's just a different home.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.390
Will you be here for Christmas?

34:20.100 --> 34:23.519
-You'll get to have two Christmases.
-l only want one.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.938
Did you make him leave?

34:27.274 --> 34:29.483
No. We both decided it.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.445
You made him sleep in Gene's room,
and it's scary in there.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.572
Listen to me, both of you.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.869
l will be here. You can call me,
and l will answer and l will be here.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.747
-Sally. Sally.
-Let her go.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.375
Please don't go. l don't want you to.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.096
Nobody wants to do this.

35:02.184 --> 35:04.518
But l need you to be a big boy.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.627
-You look awful.
-Can l come in?

35:43.517 --> 35:45.309
Do you want anything?

35:47.562 --> 35:48.896
Yes, l do.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.527
You were right.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.909
l've taken you for granted
and l've been hard on you,

36:04.955 --> 36:08.958
but only because l think l see you
as an extension of myself.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.879
And you're not.

36:15.423 --> 36:19.927
-Well, thank you for stopping by.
-Please. Sit down.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.815
Do you know why
l don't want to go to McCann?

36:32.899 --> 36:35.609
Because you can't work for anyone else.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.486
No.

36:40.156 --> 36:44.660
Because there are people out there
who buy things, people like you and me,

36:46.955 --> 36:48.831
and something happened.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.668
Something terrible.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.549
And the way that they saw themselves

37:03.263 --> 37:04.471
is gone.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.479
And nobody understands that.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.276
But you do.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.490
And that's very valuable.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.245
ls it?

37:31.416 --> 37:34.126
With you or without you, l'm moving on.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.091
And l don't know if l can do it alone.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.221
Will you help me?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.857
What if l say no?

37:59.569 --> 38:01.862
You'll never speak to me again.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.824
No.

38:08.036 --> 38:11.330
l will spend the rest of my life
trying to hire you.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.636
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.

38:26.388 --> 38:29.556
-What is she doing here?
-l said l'd be discreet.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.352
-Tell them what to do.
-l made a list and l called some movers.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.813
Can you read these?
Do you know where this stuff is?

38:35.897 --> 38:39.024
Yes. Of course you'll need the job bags
on all these accounts.

38:39.109 --> 38:42.069
We'll also need logo files,
all the film we can find

38:42.153 --> 38:45.322
-and negatives which aren't actually here.
-There you go.

38:45.407 --> 38:48.617
Very good. Now l can pack.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.287
-Sorry l'm late.
-Hi.

38:54.290 --> 38:59.003
Joan. What a good idea.
Well, you're here. Who did you bring?

38:59.629 --> 39:03.215
North American Aviation, Secor,
jai alai, Samsonite.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.260
-Clearasil.
-Really?

39:07.846 --> 39:10.431
-l made it.
-Where do we start?

39:11.307 --> 39:14.685
-Well, l'd start in the art department.
-lt's locked.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.277
Great.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.617
l'll start in my office.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.915
Joanie, l can't read your writing.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.627
lt's perfectly clear. "Correspondence."

39:44.549 --> 39:48.052
l'm tired.
Peggy, can you get me some coffee?

39:49.137 --> 39:50.179
No.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.768
Did you wash your hands?

39:58.480 --> 40:00.147
Hold the elevator.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.568
Greg is gonna kill me.

40:05.278 --> 40:08.322
l'm at the Roosevelt,
but l'll need you to find me an apartment.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.699
-Furnished?
-For the time being.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.410
l'm sorry. Good night.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.629
Go ahead, fellows.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.688
How long do you think it'll take us
to be in a place like this again?

40:43.191 --> 40:46.276
l never saw myself working
in a place like this.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.169
Don't bother.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.858
We've been robbed!

41:27.318 --> 41:30.487
He's waiting on the line.
lt's his third attempt.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.575
Saint John, how are you?

41:34.784 --> 41:37.536
What in God's name
is going on over there?

41:37.662 --> 41:40.497
l think at this point it should be very clear.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.877
You're fired. You're fired for costing
this company millions of pounds.

41:44.961 --> 41:49.423
You're fired for insubordination!
You're fired for lack of character!

41:49.591 --> 41:53.427
Very good. Happy Christmas. Mr. Hooker.

41:55.096 --> 41:59.349
l've been sacked. Please have my office
and things put in storage at this address.

41:59.434 --> 42:03.187
-What's happened?
-You're a sharp boy. You'll figure it out.

42:04.814 --> 42:08.483
So let's see.
l have Peggy and Pete sharing the desk.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.820
Don, we'll replace one of these couches
with a table for you,

42:11.905 --> 42:14.031
and we're adding
two additional phone lines.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.658
Media will be in the bedroom
with the television.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.619
Accounts gets the bed.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.371
And no one is to come to this office.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.874
lf you have meetings,
please take them elsewhere.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.502
l don't want them in the lobby
or the bar of this hotel.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.798
Well, look at that.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.471
Good morning.
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.306
How may l help you?

42:41.476 --> 42:43.977
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.316
He didn't leave a note. Nothing.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.776
Where is he?

42:50.860 --> 42:54.446
l just heard from John Deere.
Pete tried to poach them on Saturday.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.782
He must have gone with Draper.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.833
Damn it.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.004
Sure. Everything's exactly the same.

43:11.339 --> 43:17.010
Don and l will both be on the account.
Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye-bye.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.098
-Hello, everybody.
-Lovely! What are you doing here?

43:21.182 --> 43:25.435

of sandwich imaginable and a cake.

43:25.687 --> 43:28.355
-Thank you, Trudy.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.690

-This looks great, Trudy.
-l know how you boys and girls can be.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.866
-There's food.
-Thank God.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.133
Draper residence.

43:59.387 --> 44:00.387
lt's me.

44:05.560 --> 44:09.062

but l'll be working out of the Pierre.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.399
Okay.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.782
Listen, Betts, l want you to know
l'm not gonna fight you.

Thank you.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.253
l hope you get what you always wanted.

44:37.759 --> 44:40.093
You will always be their father.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.099
Okay.

44:48.644 --> 44:51.271
Well, goodbye.

44:56.277 --> 44:57.486
Goodbye.

45:13.461 --> 45:14.503
Really?

45:14.587 --> 45:19.299
You know, if you leave your shoes outside
the door here, somebody polishes them.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.759
Hello, Don.

45:21.511 --> 45:24.221
-How was your morning?
-Very productive.
