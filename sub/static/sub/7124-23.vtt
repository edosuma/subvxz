00:28.309 --> 00:29.378
Tree trunks!

00:29.455 --> 00:31.295
The slumber party's
about to start!

00:31.372 --> 00:33.847
Get those hot buns in here,
girl!

00:35.949 --> 00:39.628
Did you hear me?
I said, get those hot... unh!

00:40.336 --> 00:41.938
Hi, Mr. Pig.

00:42.673 --> 00:44.407
Why are you hitting me?

00:44.869 --> 00:47.563
I was just talking
about tree trunks' hot...

00:54.523 --> 00:58.026
Come on, Finn!
We're doing music chairs.

00:59.993 --> 01:03.091
- Everyone ready?
- Ready!

01:10.734 --> 01:12.908
Take a seat!

01:13.427 --> 01:15.855
- Uh, uh...
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

01:15.932 --> 01:17.888
There's a seat by me.

01:17.965 --> 01:19.623
Oh! Heh!

01:19.720 --> 01:21.922
You take it,
Princess. This is your party.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.903
No, no, I insist.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.608
Time is up!

01:25.685 --> 01:28.376
You two must now be sent to
the closest closet to have

01:28.453 --> 01:30.404
heavenly thoughts.

01:42.055 --> 01:45.250
Heavenly thoughts.

01:50.135 --> 01:52.148
- Hey, PB.
- Hey, Finn.

01:53.517 --> 01:54.612
Mm?

01:54.872 --> 01:56.389
Bup, bup, bup...

01:56.543 --> 01:59.201
Hey, you want to ditch the
party and go for a walk?

01:59.278 --> 02:00.713
Wha... really?

02:00.790 --> 02:03.127
It's been a while
since we just hung out, you know?

02:03.204 --> 02:04.583
What about the candy people?

02:04.660 --> 02:06.651
Aw, they should be fine, right?

02:06.728 --> 02:07.904
For once?

02:08.120 --> 02:10.919
Maybe they'll surprise me
by being fine.

02:11.050 --> 02:12.091
Come on.

02:13.329 --> 02:15.935
- Whoa!
- Secret passage.

02:16.012 --> 02:16.975
Noice.

02:17.286 --> 02:19.832
Boy, it's sure quiet in there.

02:19.909 --> 02:21.922
What's going on in there,
you think?

02:21.999 --> 02:24.437
Someone should listen
at the door.

02:27.271 --> 02:31.070
We nominate you, Crunchy,
to go listen at the door.

02:31.147 --> 02:33.546
And tell everybody
what's going on.

02:33.623 --> 02:36.728
- What? Why me?
- Come on, Crunchy.

02:36.805 --> 02:38.265
You're the go-to guy.

02:38.342 --> 02:40.214
You're the new Cinnamon Bun.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.446
No, I'm not...

02:42.829 --> 02:44.434
What do you hear?

02:44.511 --> 02:46.909
Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy.

02:46.986 --> 02:50.810
I hear, like, uh... like,
a lush green field...

02:50.887 --> 02:53.376
Next to a white picket fence.

02:53.453 --> 02:56.344
Finn and the princess both
brought picnic baskets.

02:56.421 --> 02:59.838
Oh, but they brought the same
stuff, and they' laughing about it.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.593
And now they're kissing.

03:01.670 --> 03:04.463
There's no lush green field in that closet!

03:04.540 --> 03:07.145
Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.

03:07.222 --> 03:09.111
Just tell us what you hear!

03:09.188 --> 03:11.097
I can't hear anything.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.917
They must be just lightly
brushing their lips together.

03:14.017 --> 03:17.339
Or maybe they kissed so much,
they passed out!

03:17.416 --> 03:19.883
Crunchy,
open that door!

03:21.106 --> 03:22.722
Step aside, Crunchy.

03:22.799 --> 03:25.969
I'll make
short work of this door-opening.

03:27.189 --> 03:28.258
Oh.

03:28.348 --> 03:31.030
I guess I'm just
too strong.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.605
Then they're trapped!
What if they run out of air?!

03:35.682 --> 03:38.805
No air? I'll smash down the door!

03:38.882 --> 03:40.540
- Stop!
- Eh?

03:40.617 --> 03:44.079
Mr. Cupcake, your mighty
strength might kill them!

03:44.156 --> 03:46.606
There's a drill and saw
in the supply room, though.

03:46.754 --> 03:49.930
- In here, you say?
- No, don't!

03:50.203 --> 03:52.008
Aww.

03:53.931 --> 03:55.289
Yo, guys!

03:55.398 --> 03:58.654
You got to do something!
That's my best friend in there!

03:59.251 --> 04:01.276
"You okay in there?"

04:03.300 --> 04:06.113
"Yeah, we went
out the secret coat passage."

04:06.449 --> 04:09.167
It's so nice
to get away sometimes.

04:09.244 --> 04:10.219
Mm.

04:10.296 --> 04:12.121
Candy peeps can be a handful, huh?

04:12.198 --> 04:14.276
Yeah, they mean well, though.

04:15.216 --> 04:16.704
You want to meet Timmy?

04:20.999 --> 04:22.929
Timmyyy!

04:24.146 --> 04:26.580
Aww, so squish!

04:27.288 --> 04:29.623
- Hop on.
- Okay.

04:36.366 --> 04:40.081
Breathe! Breathe!

04:40.285 --> 04:42.889
- Breathe!
- Wait. Wait!

04:42.966 --> 04:44.853
Don't candy people
breathe out, like,

04:44.930 --> 04:46.642
a poisonous gas or something?

04:46.719 --> 04:48.803
Somethin' like, uh, c... carbo...

04:48.880 --> 04:50.670
- Carbon diox...
- I know!

04:50.868 --> 04:52.991
It's called...

04:56.408 --> 04:58.582
and it is deadly.

05:00.051 --> 05:02.194
Zuck it back out! Zuck it back out!

05:02.271 --> 05:04.057
Oh!

05:06.202 --> 05:07.461
Cupcake's dead!

05:07.538 --> 05:10.058
- What do we do?!
- Ha!

05:11.439 --> 05:13.566
So, got any other weekend plans?

05:13.643 --> 05:14.647
Mm.

05:14.724 --> 05:17.079
Probably gonna hit up the arts
and crafts kingdom with BMO.

05:17.156 --> 05:19.734
- You?
- Oh, I'm gonna garden some,

05:19.811 --> 05:22.954
plan next week's pizza lunch,
answer 800 e-mails, and,

05:23.031 --> 05:24.261
you know, whatever.

05:24.338 --> 05:25.409
Wowz.

05:25.496 --> 05:28.172
Do you ever get tired from
doing princess work all the time?

05:28.292 --> 05:30.655
Sure. I mean,
it's a lot of responsibility

05:30.732 --> 05:32.363
looking after so many people,

05:32.440 --> 05:35.886
though, lately, I have been
trying to be more chill about it.

05:36.573 --> 05:38.937
Cool. Like taking ice-cream breaks?

05:39.014 --> 05:40.954
Yeah, and, like,
being more...

05:41.031 --> 05:43.672
Sort of okay with everyone
making mistakes around me.

05:43.749 --> 05:45.936
Like, mind my own stuff more.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.310
You know what I mean?

05:47.713 --> 05:48.750
Yeah.

05:48.863 --> 05:51.430
Kind of like how I've been
thinking about my dad

05:51.507 --> 05:53.368
and how I want him
to act more like daddy.

05:53.445 --> 05:56.394
But maybe acting like daddy
just isn't what he does.

05:56.471 --> 05:59.523
Maybe my dad's not a dad
but a kid stuck in a dad's body.

06:02.521 --> 06:04.132
Timmy knows what's up.

06:04.209 --> 06:06.437
Timmyyy!

06:07.125 --> 06:09.580
- Timmyyyy!
- Timmyyyy!

06:10.028 --> 06:12.215
Okeydokey, everybody.

06:12.292 --> 06:13.364
Check it out.

06:13.441 --> 06:18.047
Once in place, this sweater will muffle
the cannonball explosion perfectly,

06:18.124 --> 06:22.005
allowing the frame around
the door to gently fall apart,

06:22.082 --> 06:24.325
freeing Finn and PB.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.094
Manfried's a good leader

06:26.171 --> 06:28.301
because we can always
see him.

06:28.378 --> 06:30.735
Now, the cannon
should go right over here.

06:30.812 --> 06:31.788
Oh.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.091
Wait. Here.

06:36.533 --> 06:38.702
Aren't you worried about Finn?

06:38.779 --> 06:39.986
Of course I am.

06:40.063 --> 06:42.066
See these tears of worry?

06:43.626 --> 06:45.863
It will be okay, Jake.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.112
"PB is showing me
all this cool stuff.

06:52.189 --> 06:53.272
She has an awesome shirt."

06:53.349 --> 06:54.787
"How's the party?"

06:57.570 --> 06:59.091
Awesome.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.698
Okay, everyone,
prepare for the boom.

07:03.699 --> 07:04.803
Three...

07:04.975 --> 07:08.155
- Two...
- Fire!

07:10.513 --> 07:13.173
Aw, my cannon.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.755
Uh-oh.

07:16.161 --> 07:18.351
Hey, the closet's open!

07:22.372 --> 07:24.263
So, they're dead, right?

07:24.563 --> 07:26.046
Well, Chocoberry can tell us!

07:26.123 --> 07:27.919
She saw a ghost at my house once.

07:27.996 --> 07:31.056
Oui, it's true.
I have "ze gift."

07:34.054 --> 07:36.118
Hmmmmmm!

07:36.223 --> 07:39.271
Yes,
I sense their spirits.

07:40.531 --> 07:42.924
Finn says... he says...

07:43.207 --> 07:45.428
Remember to feed BMO.

07:49.530 --> 07:52.110
Well, that idea stank, Manfried!

07:52.187 --> 07:55.066
- I'm calling the shots from now on!
- No!

07:55.143 --> 07:58.838
Manfried is still
the most clearly visible!

07:59.464 --> 08:01.874
Hey, why don't you guys
team up and fight each other

08:01.951 --> 08:03.591
to see who gets to wear the crown?

08:24.394 --> 08:25.941
Here... try this one.

08:27.649 --> 08:29.345
Mmm! Fire.

08:30.532 --> 08:31.719
You got a little

08:31.796 --> 08:35.145
- edible-fire mustache, there.
- What?!

08:37.217 --> 08:38.799
Got to send this to Jake.

08:40.409 --> 08:41.440
Hmm.

08:41.517 --> 08:43.219
"Check it out."

08:46.408 --> 08:48.059
- Hey, what's that?
- Uh,

08:48.136 --> 08:49.714
- uh, it's...
- Let me see.

08:49.791 --> 08:51.926
- Mm.
- You won't like it but okay.

08:57.230 --> 08:58.615
I'll worry about it later.

08:58.692 --> 08:59.666
Oh.

08:59.802 --> 09:02.787
- You want to see the burrito room?
- Yessss.

09:05.850 --> 09:09.151
This is
a brutal new society.

09:09.351 --> 09:13.036
For a society to function,
it needs rules.

09:13.180 --> 09:16.373
One, you must drink tea
with your pizza.

09:16.450 --> 09:19.475
Two, pizza can only be
eaten alone.

09:19.552 --> 09:22.922
Three, if a pizza is found in a field,

09:22.999 --> 09:27.772
you must make the next person you
see holding a glass of milk eat it.

09:27.849 --> 09:31.080
Sire, I must congratulate
you on becoming princess.

09:31.157 --> 09:32.186
Thank you.

09:32.263 --> 09:33.869
Is there anything
I can do

09:33.946 --> 09:35.427
or get for you?

09:35.504 --> 09:37.843
- Anything?
- Anything!

09:37.920 --> 09:41.527
Could you perhaps
procure a pizza?

09:41.604 --> 09:43.338
Yesss.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.498
Man, this is intense.

09:45.575 --> 09:47.435
I better do something!

09:55.934 --> 09:57.677
Thanks for showing me around, PB.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.078
- I've enjoyed just hangin' out.
- Me too!

10:04.558 --> 10:06.774
Jake just sent me a
funny picture of himself.

10:09.232 --> 10:10.577
Whoa.

10:10.685 --> 10:12.658
It looks like
the candy people's makeshift

10:12.735 --> 10:15.455
government has been taken over
by a ruthless despot.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.496
What?

10:16.573 --> 10:18.367
- Why aren't you freaking out?
- Eh,

10:18.444 --> 10:19.960
it was worth giving them
a shot.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.559
Let's go back to the party,
though.

10:21.636 --> 10:23.498
It looks like
we have to save it.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.757
Neigh! Whinnie!

10:26.834 --> 10:27.990
Crun-chy!

10:28.148 --> 10:30.363
Crun-chy! Crun-chy!

10:30.440 --> 10:32.053
To the crater!

10:36.218 --> 10:38.802
Any last words, Starchy?

10:38.879 --> 10:41.807
You smell! Throw him in!

10:42.384 --> 10:44.226
What's going on here?

10:44.364 --> 10:45.820
Uh...

10:45.897 --> 10:47.809
They devolved into beasts.

10:47.886 --> 10:50.277
- It was hilarious!
- Okay.

10:50.354 --> 10:52.513
Everybody, get into your sleeping bags,

10:52.590 --> 10:54.540
and I'll read you a story.

10:57.685 --> 11:01.996
Modern menswear can be
traced back 200 years.

11:02.073 --> 11:04.474
Furs and textiles became...
