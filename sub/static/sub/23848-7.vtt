WEBVTT

00:17.080 --> 00:18.520
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:20.640
You owe me a report for the first of May.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.640
I'm working on it.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.000
They only ever made one copy
of each of König's films.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.360
You know I guaranteed that we would solve
this problem before the elections.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.560
Bruno?

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
I need your help.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.040
I have to find Krajewski.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.240
<i>He's the key.</i>

00:34.520 --> 00:38.160
If you need anything... Look, this is
what I have for you when you sing.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.760
I need something stronger.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.720
I thought it was just the thing
for you shaking chickens.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.760
Also, Kardakov was still there last night.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.560
-Where, in Berlin?
-In Sorokina's flat.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.080
They killed them all because of you.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.560
They are all dead!

00:52.640 --> 00:55.320
At Wormsstrasse.
There's some kind of basement.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.440
It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.600
Let the train pass.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.400
-According to our...
-It runs by order of the <i>Reichswehr</i>.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.760
Someone needs to sign off
the freight papers.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.440
That is Major General Seegers.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.760
One of the wagons
contains a different freight.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.400
We can't examine them here.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.680
There must be somewhere
where they can be opened.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.920
You have the necessary staff?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.280
Were you at the front line?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.400
I've seen this a thousand times.
Looks much like a gas attack.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.440
Gas!

02:00.960 --> 02:04.240
Did the paper get wet? Please iron it.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.000
CHEMICAL ACCIDENT
AT ANHALTER FREIGHT YEARD

02:09.080 --> 02:11.040
-Greta, the coffee, please.
-Right away, Mrs. Benda.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
Thank you.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.080
Yes, thank you.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.560
No. Here.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.000
Greta, and the eggs...

02:54.720 --> 02:55.640
go there.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.720
And five minutes, please.

02:58.880 --> 02:59.920
Mr. Councillor? Madam?

03:01.640 --> 03:02.560
Yes?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.520
I wanted to say thank you
for employing me.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.480
Yes, no problem.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
And the children?

03:15.520 --> 03:16.920
I'll go right away.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.000
We shouldn't be waiting for them,
but the other way around.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.800
Greta? The door, please.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.440
Good morning.

03:33.920 --> 03:39.120
Schwarz is my name, from pathology.
I urgently need to talk to the councillor.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.720
-Do come in.
-Thank you.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.080
<i>Today I speak about</i>
<i>the phenomenon of war neuroses.</i>

04:37.160 --> 04:40.960
<i>In common parlance also known</i>
<i>as 'shell shock' or 'bombshell disease.'</i>

04:42.040 --> 04:45.560
External characteristics
are an extensive loss of physical control,

04:45.640 --> 04:48.280
muscle spasms in all extremities.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.160
<i>Uncontrollable convulsions</i>
<i>in the head and face area.</i>

04:52.320 --> 04:54.800
The symptoms of those
former front line soldiers,

04:55.200 --> 05:00.120
who have the gruesome fate of their
generation written into their bodies,

05:00.200 --> 05:03.680
are witness of the most
disturbing experiences in the field.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.760
The body punishes the soul

05:07.840 --> 05:12.080
for all the impositions of the war
by rebelling.

05:13.760 --> 05:20.400
Experts also insinuate that the majority
of those cases are simulators

05:20.480 --> 05:24.080
or cowards who use some sort
of medical fringe phenomenon

05:24.160 --> 05:26.880
to evade their responsibility to society,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.920
though we must object to that vehemently.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.720
My studies from the past seven years show

05:32.800 --> 05:36.880
that those affected
actually suffer with a mental disorder.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.000
Let me give you a concrete example.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.880
Private Krajewski,
32 years of age on arrival.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.920
PRIVATE KRAJEWSKI. AGE 32 YEARS
BURIED UNDER GRENADE SHOWER

05:51.000 --> 05:55.880
At my institute, we use a new three-step
procedure I have developed.

05:56.480 --> 06:01.440
The first step is sedation of the patient
with barbituric acid derivative,

06:01.840 --> 06:07.240
and put into a hypnotic state
by means of suggestion.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.960
Hypnosis!

06:09.280 --> 06:13.320
In hypnosis, we take the patient back...

06:13.400 --> 06:15.520
to the source of his trauma.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.600
To the horrors of war.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.800
The images of his memory go as deep

06:24.520 --> 06:26.520
as what we call the subconscious.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.600
We? Who is 'we'?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.240
Is there an above-conscious, too?

06:34.040 --> 06:38.080
In the second step of the treatment
we conduct projective tests

06:38.160 --> 06:40.720
according to the method
of Professor Rohrschach...

06:40.840 --> 06:42.360
-Rohrschach? Poppycock.
-Yes.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.320
With their help we localize
the disorder exactly

06:46.400 --> 06:50.520
and very slowly approach
the patient's consciousness.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.640
Only now, the third and decisive phase
of our treatment begins.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.440
The patient's trauma
is directly addressed.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.800
When he is fully conscious.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.880
A conversational therapy can make
the treatment a lasting success.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.840
That's humbug!

07:09.920 --> 07:12.560
-What do you mean, success?
-Where will this lead to?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.240
Electricity, mister.
Muscle spindles. Heard of that?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.520
INSTITUTE FOR SUGGESTIVE THERAPY
1929

07:17.600 --> 07:20.520
Dr. Schmidt, the way I see it,
the problem is long solved

07:20.600 --> 07:25.600
since those affected have either died or
the symptoms disappeared over the years.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.800
-That's true!
-Stop this!

07:27.880 --> 07:32.240
Yes, but the closed institutions are
bursting with those ill-fated comrades.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.640
I'm talking of a thousand, 10,000 men.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.520
But it's good if they're all gone!

07:36.760 --> 07:37.600
Gentlemen!

07:37.680 --> 07:40.640
The brain is an organ, not a poetry book.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.440
Many of them are war heroes.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.600
Heroes?

07:43.680 --> 07:47.040
-What heroes are you talking about?
-Systematically removed from our midst,

07:47.120 --> 07:50.880
from our everyday life,
because they remind us of a disaster

07:50.960 --> 07:54.680
which is being glorified
by certain circles in our country!

07:54.760 --> 07:57.680
They are washouts!
They sully the reputation of our army!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.760
-Cowards and shirkers!
-Enough of this!

08:00.840 --> 08:04.400
Dr. Schmidt, you're a disgrace
for our profession.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.400
-Pseudo science!
-You are untenable!

08:10.040 --> 08:11.680
Strange methods!

08:12.960 --> 08:14.440
What a quack!

And all the broads are ugly.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
The bad food.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.120
The worst food ever.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.120
The worst beer, and the poverty.
And rashes and scabies and...
Am I right or am I right?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.440
I actually quite like it here.

Reverend, how can I help you?

09:27.080 --> 09:28.360
Dr. Schmidt sends me.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.720
From now on, this is the medicine
for the patient who just left.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.720
Barbituric acid derivative.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.000
For the first step of the procedure.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.920
Ready, set, go.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.440
So Kardakov just pretended
to be a musician? No, I don't think so, but right now
he's mainly doing revolution.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.320
Lights off, knife out.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.240
Right. Here.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.840
Thank you.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.000
Because of the black lungs
you think he's a railway worker?

10:42.080 --> 10:42.920
That's right.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.880
-Well deduced, Toni.
-Let me see.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.440
-Where did you get the stamp from?
-Borrowed it.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.080
Looks genuine, doesn't it?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.120
It says "police".

11:00.440 --> 11:03.360
No one will look closely.
As long as it's official.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.680
Press police officer Ritter.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.320
Use your clever head in school, missy.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.440
You're daft.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.280
-Can't I come along?
-To the freight yard?

11:12.720 --> 11:14.520
Have you lost your mind or something?

I can't go on any longer.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.920
First the negative
and the copy, everything.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.520
They'll do the same with me as with König.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.040
-König shot himself.
-But not of his own accord.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.000
We'll be back.
In the meantime, think about it.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.640
-But I can't think anymore!
-Yeah, yeah.

OK, let's pack up and go over to 64.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.560
-Hello.
-Hi.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.000
You look like someone who could help me.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.360
Well then, I'll help you.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.520
See? I said that.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.680
-Yes, me too.
-Good.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.040
Here's my all-important question.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.080
Go on then.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.240
How many trains per week
arrive here from Russia?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.640
I'd say two or three.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.800
When did the last one arrive?

13:11.160 --> 13:13.480
Three days ago,
the one with the big bang yesterday.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.800
Big bang.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.880
That's right.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.640
Hey, Werner.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.440
-Who's she?
-Madam here is...

13:26.520 --> 13:27.680
With the press.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.080
-The juicy press?
-So to speak.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.440
<i>Berliner Illustrierte.</i>

13:33.440 --> 13:35.520
Check it out! My wife reads that.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.440
-Do you have ID?
-Yes.

13:44.080 --> 13:44.920
Alright.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.840
I heard one of the wagons exploded.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.400
Oh, don't. That's just what I needed.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.200
Thank you, Fuchse. Got a light, too?

13:56.240 --> 13:59.240
Some moron opened the hatch and...

14:01.240 --> 14:05.760
Lick my kettle. That was some whistle.
Took out some of our boys.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.040
And ever since...
you can see for yourself.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.800
And inside?

14:11.440 --> 14:15.080
There are some experts from Nyssen AG,
examining the wagons.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.320
Who are the coats?

14:18.480 --> 14:19.760
They're all Russians.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.120
Secret service or I don't know.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.480
They've been here
since that thing exploded.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.560
It was a Soviet train.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.800
Can I take a look inside?

14:31.720 --> 14:32.680
Miss.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.560
You're something else. That's why I'm here.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.720
So that no one takes a look.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.360
What? Yesterday?

14:53.720 --> 14:55.360
I don't believe it.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.480
How could that have happened?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.120
This should never have happened.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.400
Are you sure
the Russians weren't involved?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.320
Yes, I read about it.
A chemical accident.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.680
Alright.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.760
I agree.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.680
Let's do that.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.520
Alright.
Let them examine the wagons, and...

15:34.160 --> 15:38.200
Let them examine the wagons, and if they
find something they want, be my guest.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.960
Yes. I'll calm down. Yes.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.440
I agree. Excellent, yes.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.880
Excellent. Yes.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.280
Goodbye, Wegner.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.080
Good morning.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.840
And what happens in your life
after five o'clock?

16:12.320 --> 16:13.520
Nothing special.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.040
We could see about that.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.160
I'll think about it.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.160
Who dares wins.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.200
I'll think long and hard about it.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.920
Careful, miss. That boy is dangerous.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
Doesn't have his nickname for nothing.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.560
Which is?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.680
Stick-it-in Fox.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.040
Come on now.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.040
Nice guys.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.680
The two of us,
that would have been something.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.880
Yes. What a pity.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.960
Well, then. Dismount!

17:09.120 --> 17:11.080
-Spread out!
-On the double.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.440
Move it!

17:14.520 --> 17:15.840
Faster, faster!

17:20.760 --> 17:22.880
-Open the gate.
-Yes, but...

17:23.680 --> 17:24.600
Open the gate!

17:27.040 --> 17:29.200
Stop. No admittance.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.440
Search him!

17:31.920 --> 17:32.920
Search everyone!

17:33.520 --> 17:34.480
Line up, everyone!

17:38.040 --> 17:39.200
Search those two.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.400
Go on, faster.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.440
Everyone at the table, stand up.
On the double!

17:44.720 --> 17:46.960
Move. Form a line here.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.560
Search everyone.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.040
Hand over your guns.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.120
What is this?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.360
I'm guessing you're responsible for this?

17:57.520 --> 17:58.480
What makes you think that?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.360
Benda, Berlin police, first division.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.720
Left pocket. My diplomat's ID.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.080
Disarm everyone.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.320
That's all of them.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.160
Are these registered?

18:28.960 --> 18:29.920
Very well.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.400
You can collect them tomorrow
at police headquarters,

18:32.480 --> 18:34.040
on presentation of an owner's card.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.760
Right, gentlemen.
How kind of you to do our work for us.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.640
Let's see your analyses.
What's in the wagons?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.000
Rath.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.600
<i>-It's me.</i>
-What is it?

18:50.680 --> 18:53.560
<i>I'm at Anhalter freight yard.</i>
<i>You should come here.</i>

18:53.880 --> 18:56.000
I told you I won't get you out again.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.760
<i>-No, this is different.</i>
-Different how?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.880
<i>I found a trace. The dead Russian.</i>

19:02.320 --> 19:03.160
What?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.880
That's it for now, Mr. Trokhin.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.840
Then we will both find out
if this is still a Soviet domestic matter.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.880
This matter will surely,
how do the Germans say...

19:16.000 --> 19:16.960
create some internal waves.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.880
That will be unavoidable.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.080
Mr. Councillor,
the chemists did spot checks.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.800
So far only on three wagons.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.600
Let us inside.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.560
How did you get here?

19:38.760 --> 19:40.080
How did you know about this?

19:40.320 --> 19:41.400
I'll tell you later.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.000
How many wagons are there?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.080
-In total, 13.
-Stop.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.160
-No admittance.
-I'm with the club.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.320
Still. Restricted area. Sorry.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.480
Rath? Rath!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.240
Mr. Councillor.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.680
-What are you doing here?
-We followed a trace.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.760
The driver of this train
was probably murdered.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.640
-Pardon?
-His body was found in the Spree river.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.520
-In the Landwehrkanal.
-Right.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
Who is she?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.560
This is Miss Ritter, typist.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.600
Mr. Councillor? Could you come here?

20:19.880 --> 20:22.120
I want to know more. Ride in my car?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.560
Yes, sure.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.160
All samples tested positive for phosphene.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.880
-Do I come along?
-That's enough for us.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.880
-Cordon everything off.
-No.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.200
Come along.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.480
Early evening, at Aschinger?

20:36.040 --> 20:38.160
-Half past six should be OK.
-Fine.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.640
Juicy press.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.760
What I'm telling you now
is highly confidential.

21:04.520 --> 21:08.120
In those sheds
there are 13 cases of treason,

21:08.200 --> 21:10.280
due to the illegal import
of warfare agents.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.440
Contraband from the Soviet Union.
It's been increasing for years.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.800
What exactly are they smuggling?

21:16.880 --> 21:19.880
At first, it was conventional weapons
in small numbers.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.080
Then it became bigger and bigger.

21:22.160 --> 21:27.000
Anti-aircraft guns, tanks, heavy guns.
And now... poison gas.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.760
That's new.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.960
Who is importing all of that?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.120
Have you heard of the Black Reichswehr?

21:35.160 --> 21:36.080
Just some rumors.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.560
Secret military.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.760
Irregular combat units.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.600
They are using a network of stooges
for their camouflaged weapon transports.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.760
At least two dozens, always different.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.000
But the Black Reichswehr
is always behind them.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.880
But it's hard to prove
since that group doesn't officially exist.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.280
Well, the body
of the railway worker does exist.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.760
Maybe that's a clue that will help us.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.160
This case could be
of the highest importance for us.

22:04.440 --> 22:09.240
You must stay on it, Rath. I need any clue
that can help me narrow down the suspects.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.760
-Who ordered this delivery from Russia?
-Alfred Nyssen.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.160
-The steel corporation?
-Yes.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.320
One of their puppets, I guess.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.720
We'll take a closer look at him next.

22:23.960 --> 22:28.560
The aim of these people is nothing less
than the destruction of our democracy.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.000
So?

23:11.160 --> 23:13.080
Like I said,
the Willi Schulze case has priority.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.560
You two go round the neighbors,
Norbert, you go to Rote Katze.

23:17.640 --> 23:21.480
Oh, and at the El Dorado,
there's a new gambling team.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.080
We'll plant Johannes there.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.920
Clear as mud? Off you go, vice squaddies.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.440
Just in time, my friend.
Are you busy tonight?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.160
We're having a little party.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.760
I want to introduce you to someone.
Guest of honor.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.520
We start at seven.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.880
-That's nice, Bruno. But...
-No.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.080
You have to mingle a bit.
You'll go mad in here.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.880
There you are, finally.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.160
We have a date.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.680
Would you?

24:31.160 --> 24:34.960
Thanks. Didn't Wolter tell you
that you can bring me?

24:41.240 --> 24:42.080
Thank you.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.360
Well then?

24:56.800 --> 24:59.960
Wormsstrasse, Köpenick.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.280
Where is he?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.880
What now, is someone else coming?

25:10.960 --> 25:13.440
-I don't know, actually...
-I need the table.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.480
Oh, there he is.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.200
Stefan.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.680
Charlotte, what are you doing here,
all alone? I was waiting for you.
We've got something planned. Are you free?

25:32.360 --> 25:33.200
The two of us?

25:33.280 --> 25:34.760
Yes. The bill!

25:35.960 --> 25:38.200
A little excursion, to Köpenick.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.920
Gentlemen, excuse me.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.520
Major Scheer asked for absolute darkness
for his demonstration.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.880
Mauser K-97, officially banned.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.480
Comrades, Captain Wolter
and I have the honor

26:00.560 --> 26:04.240
of introducing the prototype of <i>Zieldrei</i>
to you this evening.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.720
Why darkness?

26:08.840 --> 26:11.480
This model is an absolute world's first.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.480
By powder alloying the vision lines
with radioactive radium

26:15.560 --> 26:19.480
it was possible to develop a functioning
rifle scope for darkness.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.920
For the first time ever...

26:23.280 --> 26:25.680
it is also possible to deploy snipers...

26:28.240 --> 26:29.600
in the dark.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.040
From what I understood
at the freight yard,

26:36.120 --> 26:40.840
there was poison gas in the train,
I mean in the wagons, not pesticides.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.760
And poison gas is banned.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.960
So Benda confiscated the train.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.520
And the railway worker whom
they found dead in the Landwehrkanal...

26:48.600 --> 26:49.880
-Good evening.
-Evening.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.640
He drove the train to Berlin.
He's part of that organization.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.720
They call themselves Red Fortress.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.160
PRINTER'S

27:08.360 --> 27:10.320
Funny, it looks deserted.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.960
-How do you know all this?
-I investigated.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.120
I see.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.240
-Charlotte, what are you doing?
-Why? There's no one here.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.000
Look, the putty is not dry.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.000
Are you nuts?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.360
Here's the key.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.400
-We can't just walk in there.
-Yes, we can.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.040
As clean as when it was delivered.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.200
-Why do they renovate the place?
-No idea.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.320
What would the chief inspector do now?

28:33.400 --> 28:34.800
-Wolter?
-Yes.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.040
Lock up the guy who gave him the clue
and then go for dinner. -And Rath, what would he do?
-Stay silent.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.400
And then do this with his eyebrows.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.720
No, seriously.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.800
Charlotte?

28:56.320 --> 28:57.560
Pull that lever there.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.880
-A 'print king'.
-A what?

29:16.480 --> 29:18.880
That's what they call sheets
that are stuck in the press.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.880
Oh.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.120
What does it say?

29:22.400 --> 29:23.240
It's a railway paper... CONSIGNMENT NOTE

29:24.240 --> 29:26.000
...AB 3-2-2-1.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.280
Istanbul.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.320
Istanbul?

29:31.600 --> 29:35.040
What does the Red Fortress
want to do with poison gas in Istanbul?

29:39.840 --> 29:43.440
-Oh! Nice of you to come.
-Here, potato salad.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.480
Great, come in.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.960
Gereon, the men are upstairs at Scheers'.
The flat above us.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.960
-OK.
-See you later.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.640
Thank you.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.760
The railway line from Ypres to Comines.

30:02.840 --> 30:08.280
On May 5, 1918, at 8:45 a.m.,

30:08.360 --> 30:13.000
the second attack of the 30th infantry
division, led by General Heisen.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.960
Heavy artillery on the other side. The Brits respond with barrage fire.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.600
Hand grenade thrower troops.

30:25.960 --> 30:30.080
Only Battle Battalion 31
reaches the group of hills.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.680
Colonel Seegers is in command.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.880
Our men in the crossfire
between Zwarteleen and Zillebeke.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.480
The enemy ring is blown up.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.880
The height is conquered and handed over
to the division's chief commander.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.960
At exactly 7:51 p.m.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.080
Comrades.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.360
Today we commemorate the many men
from our unit who have fallen.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.880
Rahn,

31:08.320 --> 31:10.480
Müller, Zangert,

31:11.040 --> 31:13.520
Wiedemann, Fischer,

31:14.400 --> 31:18.360
Behnke, Michaelis, Kohn.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.640
Fallen for Germany.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.360
Honor to their memory.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.240
Winkelmann, Hase,

31:27.320 --> 31:29.680
Röhler, Kuhnert,

31:29.760 --> 31:32.360
von Dülmenau, Rosen.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.120
The German army.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.120
Unbeaten in the field.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.600
-Who betrayed us?
-Social democrats.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.920
<i>I once had a comrade</i>

31:53.000 --> 31:56.760
<i>You couldn't find a better one</i>

31:57.400 --> 32:02.280
<i>The drum beat to the fight</i>

32:02.360 --> 32:06.880
<i>He was marching by my side</i>

32:06.960 --> 32:11.080
<i>Keeping up the pace</i>

32:11.160 --> 32:15.880
<i>Keeping up the pace</i>

32:16.480 --> 32:21.080
<i>A bullet came a-flying</i>

32:21.160 --> 32:25.240
<i>Is it meant for me or you?</i>

32:25.840 --> 32:30.200
<i>He is torn away</i>

32:30.320 --> 32:34.880
<i>He's lying by my feet</i>

32:34.960 --> 32:39.240
<i>As if he was a piece of me</i>

32:39.320 --> 32:43.560
<i>As if he was a piece of me</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:52.080
Retreat!

32:56.280 --> 32:57.880
Retreat!

33:50.600 --> 33:51.760
<i>Gereon!</i>

33:53.480 --> 33:54.800
Gereon.

33:54.880 --> 33:58.240
<i>He's lying by my feet</i>

33:58.320 --> 34:02.480
<i>As if he was a piece of me</i>

34:02.560 --> 34:07.520
<i>As if he was a piece of me</i>

34:23.320 --> 34:24.440
Right, comrades.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.160
Please come downstairs now.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.800
Emmi and the ladies
have prepared some snacks.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.720
Come.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.720
Arndt, you did that really well.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.120
Father taught it to me.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.280
Yes, but you recited it.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.040
With dignity,
and appropriately for the occasion.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.400
At ease.

34:53.160 --> 34:55.760
Nyssen AG is one of the biggest steel
producers in the Reich.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.080
We'll be causing a storm.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.200
Alfred Nyssen personally
ordered this shipment.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.440
He must face the law for this.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.320
The evidence is overwhelming.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.280
Those people hate social democracy.
They hate the Jews.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.560
We are both their personal enemies, Karl.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.720
Arresting Alfred Nyssen
gives us the opportunity

35:13.800 --> 35:15.680
to fight for the strength of the republic.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.280
Alright, I agree.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.680
Ready for the storm?

35:24.520 --> 35:27.160
Yes, this is the chance
we've been waiting for.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.400
I wish you much success.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.040
Good night, president.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.480
-Miss Overbeck?
-Mr. Councillor?

35:48.800 --> 35:52.600
I don't have to tell you
that everything you hear in this house

35:52.680 --> 35:53.880
is highly confidential.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.320
No, I know that.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.640
This includes the visitors
we have here, right?

35:59.720 --> 36:02.720
Yes, sir.
Madam has explained everything to me.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.000
Very well.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.880
Sebald? This is Benda. Please arrange
for Alfred Nyssen to be arrested.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.680
-Very soon.
-I agree.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.000
You are beautiful, Lieschen.
I'm so happy she is going out again.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.280
But I am going out.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.080
You're a beautiful woman
and much too young to...

36:43.160 --> 36:44.280
Emmi, please.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.840
And this dress looks great on you.
Don't you agree?

36:47.920 --> 36:50.120
-Yes.
-See? The inspector can also see

36:50.200 --> 36:51.520
that it looks great on you.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.360
-I don't get that impression from you.
-That's a pity.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.720
-We hardly ever see you at home anymore.
-Work.

36:58.800 --> 37:03.120
And I thought you were on the run,
you're running out every morning.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.880
Excuse me. I wanted to introduce you
to someone who knows a Rath in Cologne.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.080
There are quite a few Raths.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.640
One of 22nd infantry, army group west.

37:13.080 --> 37:17.120
Oh. Please excuse me, Emmi, Mrs. Behnke.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.280
He's still unattached.
I asked him the other day.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.720
-Is he really?
-Yes.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.280
-...we can do it just like that.
-Major General, Inspector Rath.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.560
-Our colleague from Cologne.
-I'm honored. Pleased to meet you.

37:38.640 --> 37:42.080
Good evening. The captain told me
you knew someone named Rath?

37:42.160 --> 37:46.200
Yes, I came across a Rath in Emerdingen,
when I was forming my cadre.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.720
-Anno Rath?
-Possibly...

37:49.680 --> 37:50.880
A jolly fellow.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.360
He could do a standing jump
onto any table, and he did, too. -That's my brother.
-Charming, funny.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.000
When he entered a room, it didn't take
two minutes for everyone to talk to him

38:01.080 --> 38:05.160
or about him. He was admired without envy.

38:05.720 --> 38:10.040
And the wenches, as far as there were any,
ran after him in droves.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.800
<i>I know what you're talking about.</i>

38:15.120 --> 38:17.040
So where is your brother now?

38:19.880 --> 38:20.880
Retreat!

38:21.880 --> 38:23.320
Are you deaf? Retreat!

38:23.560 --> 38:25.080
My brother is still alive.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.680
Gereon?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.560
Gereon!

38:54.120 --> 38:55.720
Gereon!

39:48.440 --> 39:49.960
Thank you, Gereon.

39:50.480 --> 39:51.440
Thank you. Get up!

39:56.480 --> 39:57.520
Get up!

39:58.160 --> 39:59.720
Come here, there are two more.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.440
Get up!

40:03.520 --> 40:04.360
Get up!

40:06.240 --> 40:07.600
Come here, you bastard.

40:10.920 --> 40:11.760
Come, I said.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.760
No! Anno!

40:20.040 --> 40:21.320
I was captured...

40:22.520 --> 40:24.520
and was forced to leave Anno behind.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.640
-Captivity.
-For three months.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.520
And no trace of your brother?

40:33.720 --> 40:38.360
Dozens of tracing requests,
war welfare, Red Cross, everywhere.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.200
He is secretly holding the line...

40:44.160 --> 40:48.480
which we will return to as soon as
we get back what belongs to us.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.280
Alfred Nyssen?

41:32.040 --> 41:33.120
Come with us.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.000
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

43:53.200 --> 43:55.160
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

43:57.000 --> 43:59.040
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:01.400 --> 44:04.320
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

44:11.480 --> 44:13.960
<i>Ocean of time</i>

44:15.560 --> 44:17.360
<i>Eternal law</i>

44:18.920 --> 44:21.040
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:24.120
<i>To ashes</i>

44:24.520 --> 44:26.240
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:39.080 --> 44:42.040
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

44:42.760 --> 44:44.960
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

44:46.280 --> 44:48.920
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:50.000 --> 44:52.240
<i>Miracles wait</i>

44:53.600 --> 44:56.200
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:57.640 --> 45:00.960
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>
