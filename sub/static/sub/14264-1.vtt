3, 2, 1.

01:18.094 --> 01:21.395
vortex crystal
demutation ray activated.

01:23.231 --> 01:24.131
if this works,

01:24.132 --> 01:26.799
our wild mutations
may soon be history.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.201
aah aah uhh.

01:30.804 --> 01:32.638
he survived
the energy ray.

01:32.639 --> 01:35.540
now if his genes
check out as normal,

01:35.541 --> 01:37.141
we're home free,
fellas.

01:37.142 --> 01:38.877
uh--uh, dudes,

01:38.878 --> 01:41.311
i--i feel kind of funny.

01:44.248 --> 01:46.082
he's mutating !

01:58.460 --> 02:00.628
leonardo: whoa, look out !
get out of the way !

02:02.263 --> 02:04.564
snap out of it,
michelangelo.

02:04.565 --> 02:06.299
i don't want
to have to hurt you.

02:10.902 --> 02:13.272
sorry,
michelangelo,

02:13.273 --> 02:14.440
but you asked
for it.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.980
come on, michelangelo,
snap out of it.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.784
just our luck,
a swiss army mutant.

02:41.730 --> 02:43.430
whoa.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.332
ah, well,
that didn't work.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.333
it's a good thing

02:46.334 --> 02:48.234
we ran a virtual
reality simulation

02:48.235 --> 02:49.836
on that demutation ray

02:49.837 --> 02:51.871
before we tried it
on ourselves.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.406
look on
the bright side, guys.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.506
we can make a bundle

02:54.507 --> 02:56.108
selling that
as a video game.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.342
can i play it again ?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.211
this is no joke,
raphael.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.745
we've got
to find a way

03:00.746 --> 03:02.013
to stabilize
our mutations.

03:02.014 --> 03:04.081
stormy seas
grow calm

03:04.082 --> 03:06.284
when the wind
stops blowing.

03:06.285 --> 03:09.452
calm you mind and you
will find the answer.

03:09.453 --> 03:11.421
ahh, all right.

03:11.422 --> 03:13.455
let's start over
with the calculations.

03:29.203 --> 03:30.371
lord dregg,

03:30.372 --> 03:32.604
sensors indicate
that vortex crystals

03:32.605 --> 03:34.106
have been activated

03:34.107 --> 03:35.842
within this quadrant
of the galaxy.

03:35.843 --> 03:39.277
the readings are
coming from earth !

03:39.278 --> 03:42.247
of course.
those mutant turtles

03:42.248 --> 03:45.149
must've figured out that
the crystal has the power

03:45.150 --> 03:47.484
to stabilize
their mutations.

03:47.485 --> 03:50.121
but the readings
are so low, lord dregg.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.756
they must only have
a few fragments.

03:52.757 --> 03:54.457
with even the tiniest piece,

03:54.458 --> 03:58.260
i can genetically recreate
another crystal.

03:58.261 --> 04:01.296
then i can complete
the vortex transporter.

04:01.297 --> 04:02.931
where's mung ?

04:02.932 --> 04:06.100
here, your lordship.

04:06.101 --> 04:08.436
when will
the dreggnaught be ready ?

04:08.437 --> 04:11.538
oh, it is ready now,
your lordship.

04:11.539 --> 04:14.474
but, dregg, even if
we return to earth,

04:14.475 --> 04:16.507
it will take months
to reconstruct

04:16.509 --> 04:18.142
the vortex transporter.

04:18.144 --> 04:20.245
may it please you,
sire...

04:20.247 --> 04:23.681
with this you can build
whatever you dream

04:23.682 --> 04:25.483
in just hours.

04:25.484 --> 04:26.851
that's impossible.

04:26.852 --> 04:28.018
you are looking at

04:28.019 --> 04:32.756
over a million
computerized microbots.

04:32.757 --> 04:35.258
mung, how would you
like to leave

04:35.259 --> 04:39.061
this slimy planet and
be my second in command ?

04:39.062 --> 04:41.063
but i am your
second in command !

04:41.064 --> 04:43.532
no one but dregg
is superior

04:43.533 --> 04:45.400
to the high-tech.

04:52.373 --> 04:56.008
i'm sending you on
a mission, high-tech.

04:56.009 --> 04:58.444
you'll orbit the galaxy
like a space probe

04:58.445 --> 05:04.916
and return with untold data
in say, 2,000 light years.

05:06.318 --> 05:07.684
high-tech: lord dregg !

05:07.685 --> 05:11.756
no !

05:11.757 --> 05:14.657
i will not
disappoint you,

05:14.658 --> 05:16.326
my lord.

05:21.731 --> 05:24.099
i've adjusted the crystal
oscillation frequency

05:24.100 --> 05:26.066
to automatically match
your genetic codes.

05:26.067 --> 05:28.169
it should work
this time.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.471
all right, let's run
another v. r. test.

05:36.778 --> 05:40.680
whoa, dudes, i feel like
totally perfectimundo,

05:40.681 --> 05:43.149
even though i am
a virtual turtle.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.348
we did it.

05:44.349 --> 05:45.684
now all
i've got to do

05:45.685 --> 05:47.685
is run a simulation
on my genetic code.

05:50.721 --> 05:52.389
carter: commencing
simulation.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.794
no, it didn't work.
the vortex crystal

05:57.795 --> 06:00.463
has no effect on
my genetic code.

06:00.464 --> 06:02.965
the same notes
played another way

06:02.966 --> 06:05.300
make
beautiful music.

06:05.301 --> 06:08.036
you must find your
own song, carter.

06:14.009 --> 06:15.642
scanners have located

06:15.643 --> 06:19.012
the vortex crystal
emissions, lord dregg.

06:19.013 --> 06:21.348
i trust your microbots
will be able

06:21.349 --> 06:23.349
to accomplish the task.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.651
it will take only one

06:25.652 --> 06:28.486
to track down
the vortex crystal.

06:28.487 --> 06:32.389
a microrocket.
brilliant.

06:40.563 --> 06:42.631
vital signs
are holding steady.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.839
crystal fragments
are charged and ready.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.606
stabilizing raphael's
genetic code.

06:56.711 --> 06:58.578
excuse me.

07:04.417 --> 07:05.984
stabilizing donatello.

07:09.588 --> 07:11.123
aah.

07:11.124 --> 07:12.056
hmm.

07:17.529 --> 07:19.562
stabilizing michelangelo.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.375
stabilizing leonardo.

07:47.587 --> 07:49.288
ah, that was easy.

07:49.289 --> 07:51.122
yeah, but how
can we be sure

07:51.123 --> 07:52.791
we're really
back to normal ?

07:52.792 --> 07:54.292
leonardo's
got a point.

07:54.293 --> 07:56.393
we need to test
your genetic stability.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.962
yeah, we usually
mutate under stress.

07:58.963 --> 08:01.131
too bad we don't have
that alien sleazeball dregg

08:01.132 --> 08:02.464
to deal with.

08:02.465 --> 08:04.133
i wouldn't be
so hasty

08:04.134 --> 08:05.567
in your assumption,
raphael.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.203
but in the meantime,

08:07.204 --> 08:09.570
i suggest you try
some sparring.

08:09.571 --> 08:10.738
hyah !

08:19.647 --> 08:24.450
oh, i think we're...
totally back to normal.

08:24.451 --> 08:28.586
i think
i'm totally... wasted.

08:31.991 --> 08:35.126
it appears you are back
to your stable form.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.596
hey, carter,
where are you going ?

08:39.597 --> 08:41.965
well, i came here
to learn from splinter,

08:41.966 --> 08:44.367
and i'm grateful for
all you've taught me,

08:44.368 --> 08:47.102
but i think i should
go back to college.

08:47.103 --> 08:48.871
maybe if i continue
my studies

08:48.872 --> 08:51.073
in biochemistry,
i can discover a way

08:51.074 --> 08:52.441
to change myself
back to normal.

08:52.442 --> 08:55.677
don't be silly.
we'll find a way

08:55.678 --> 08:57.245
to stabilize
your mutations.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.780
yeah, and besides, we've
gotten used to having

08:59.781 --> 09:01.615
a non-turtle
in the family.

09:01.616 --> 09:04.417
thanks, guys,
but i've made up my mind.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.685
and you're sure

09:05.686 --> 09:07.153
we can't change
your mind, carter ?

09:07.154 --> 09:11.057
well, then we're
sure gonna miss you.

09:11.058 --> 09:12.157
huh ?

09:16.496 --> 09:17.828
whoa !

09:22.667 --> 09:25.701
come on, leonardo.
first, you rag on me

09:25.702 --> 09:27.603
for goofing off
at the v. r. simulator,

09:27.604 --> 09:30.040
now you're doing it.
hey !

09:30.940 --> 09:32.106
whoa !

09:32.107 --> 09:33.107
ohh !

09:33.108 --> 09:35.043
that's no simulation.

09:35.044 --> 09:37.077
leonardo's mutated !

09:37.879 --> 09:39.280
no kidding.

09:41.884 --> 09:43.249
we've got to stop him

09:43.250 --> 09:45.051
before he trashes
the whole lair.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.819
take it easy, dude.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.688
we're your buds.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.722
yeow !

09:56.061 --> 09:57.061
uhh.

09:57.062 --> 09:58.762
talk about
a terrible time

09:58.763 --> 10:00.731
not to have our
super mutation powers.

10:00.732 --> 10:01.932
donatello:
he's getting away !

10:04.768 --> 10:06.569
we'll catch him
in the van.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.137
raphael:
carter, let's roll.

10:08.138 --> 10:09.638
carter:
leonardo's mutation

10:09.639 --> 10:11.307
was caused by
a power drop.

10:11.308 --> 10:12.875
i should've seen it.

10:12.876 --> 10:14.776
hey, let's worry about
whose fault it is

10:14.777 --> 10:16.711
after we get him
under control.

10:16.712 --> 10:19.047
no. i've got to find out
what went wrong.

10:19.048 --> 10:20.514
you go on without me.

10:27.887 --> 10:31.257
the microbot has returned,
lord dregg.

10:35.061 --> 10:38.130
mung: and it's got
the crystal fragment.

10:38.131 --> 10:39.663
excellent.

10:42.301 --> 10:45.402
once the genetic cloning
of the crystal is complete,

10:45.403 --> 10:49.339
it will power
my vortex transporter.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.741
capable of
transporting anything

10:51.742 --> 10:55.478
from one end of
the universe to the other.

10:55.479 --> 10:59.180
oh, just what you need
to conquer the earth.

10:59.181 --> 11:04.185
exactly. and eliminate those
meddlesome turtles as well.

11:04.186 --> 11:06.086
prepare
the remaining microbots.

11:06.087 --> 11:07.721
yes, lord dregg.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.028
cab driver: yeah, sure
there's plenty of kooks

11:17.029 --> 11:19.130
and crazies, lady.
but on the whole,

11:19.131 --> 11:20.799
i think the city's
getting better.

11:23.135 --> 11:24.635
uh, like
i was saying,

11:24.636 --> 11:27.771
the city is no kind
of place to live !

11:27.772 --> 11:29.439
look, there he is !

11:32.576 --> 11:35.277
i sure hope our insurance
covers mutant damage.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.781
easy, leonardo.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.817
now, we're not gonna
hurt you.

11:41.818 --> 11:45.319
he's definitely having
a bad hair day.

11:54.261 --> 11:56.361
michelangelo: oh, great,
just what we needed,

11:56.362 --> 11:57.896
more bad press.

11:57.897 --> 12:00.599
we've got to get leonardo
out of here and fast.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.465
get ready, guys.

12:03.936 --> 12:06.437
hey, leonardo, catch !

12:13.111 --> 12:14.143
get the van, dudes !

12:18.982 --> 12:20.948
yeow !

12:20.949 --> 12:21.949
whoa ow !

12:21.950 --> 12:24.519
whoa ow !

12:26.621 --> 12:28.321
raphael, call april

12:28.322 --> 12:30.891
and see if she can keep
us off the 11:00 news.

12:30.892 --> 12:33.192
oh, sure, give me
the impossible job.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.495
april,
it's raphael.

12:36.496 --> 12:37.363
what's up ?

12:37.364 --> 12:39.364
leonardo's mutated
out of control.

12:39.365 --> 12:40.799
he's doing
a king kong routine

12:40.800 --> 12:42.301
for the local news.

12:42.302 --> 12:44.203
can you pull the plug
on the story ?

12:44.204 --> 12:45.937
hmm, let's see.

12:45.938 --> 12:49.006
oh, sorry, guys.
it's a live feed.

12:49.007 --> 12:50.341
raphael: in that case,
how about calling

12:50.342 --> 12:51.775
the department of
animal regulation ?

13:03.453 --> 13:05.186
he's headed
toward downtown.

13:05.187 --> 13:07.288
we might be able to
catch him in the van.

13:09.792 --> 13:13.893
lord dregg,
look at this.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.762
newscaster: and then
the mutated creature,

13:15.763 --> 13:18.731
believed to be one of
the infamous ninja turtles,

13:18.732 --> 13:20.399
destroyed a gas station

13:20.400 --> 13:22.401
before being helped
to escape

13:22.402 --> 13:24.268
by his turtle accomplices.

13:24.269 --> 13:27.005
so, one of the turtles
has mutated

13:27.006 --> 13:29.806
into an even more
degenerate creature.

13:29.807 --> 13:32.308
this will make my plans
to conquer the earth

13:32.309 --> 13:35.411
and destroy those
turtles even easier.

13:35.412 --> 13:38.080
mung, prepare
the shuttle.

13:38.081 --> 13:39.882
yes, lord dregg.

13:54.195 --> 13:57.030
eh, first it's roaches,
now it's ants.

13:57.031 --> 13:58.665
well, i'll fix 'em.

14:02.135 --> 14:03.268
huh ?

14:07.038 --> 14:09.073
whoa !

14:36.530 --> 14:38.331
he's got to be
around here somewhere.

14:38.332 --> 14:39.265
hold it.
what ?

14:39.266 --> 14:40.633
shh.
what's wrong ?

14:41.702 --> 14:43.168
ohh.

15:06.689 --> 15:08.990
oh, no.
it's dregg !

15:08.991 --> 15:12.326
and he's got some
seriously ugly new buds !

15:12.327 --> 15:15.595
oh, you say that as if
you're not glad to see me.

15:17.365 --> 15:19.265
turtles: look out !

15:31.343 --> 15:32.844
atta boy, leonardo !

15:32.845 --> 15:34.811
protect your
fellow turtles !

15:36.380 --> 15:38.581
mung, get us
out of here.

15:42.018 --> 15:44.686
way to go, dude !
give me three !

15:44.687 --> 15:46.355
oh !

15:48.624 --> 15:50.024
whoa.

15:50.025 --> 15:53.061
he should definitely
cut down on his sugar.

15:55.097 --> 15:58.532
huh. there must be
an answer here somewhere.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.266
can i get you
anything else, hon ?

16:00.267 --> 16:01.367
wait a minute.

16:01.368 --> 16:03.569
it looks like someone
or something

16:03.570 --> 16:05.171
stole a piece
of the crystal.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.205
maybe it wasn't
my fault after all.

16:11.310 --> 16:12.543
aah !
whoa !

16:15.046 --> 16:17.548
aah ! oh !

16:17.549 --> 16:19.516
aah !

16:23.487 --> 16:24.686
look out !

16:33.395 --> 16:34.996
quick ! tie him up !

16:39.066 --> 16:41.067
sorry
i ducked out on you,

16:41.068 --> 16:43.903
but i finally figured out
what went wrong.

16:43.904 --> 16:46.772
you can tell us about it
on the way back to the lair.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.077
oh, great.

16:54.579 --> 16:56.079
well, can you tell me

16:56.080 --> 16:57.447
when the power's going
to come back on ?

16:58.950 --> 17:00.583
what do you mean,
no one knows what's wrong ?

17:00.584 --> 17:02.885
ok. thanks.

17:02.886 --> 17:05.354
the power went out
at the hydroelectric dam,

17:05.355 --> 17:07.489
but they haven't been able
to contact anyone there.

17:07.490 --> 17:10.558
sounds like that's
where the problem is.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.275
what the heck
is going on here ?

17:52.928 --> 17:54.429
whatever's going on,

17:54.430 --> 17:57.899
i bet i'll find the answer
at the end of these cables.

18:02.970 --> 18:07.440
incredible. dregg !

18:09.443 --> 18:12.143
power connections
are complete.

18:12.144 --> 18:15.214
soon, when the vortex
transporter is complete,

18:15.215 --> 18:19.149
i shall transport something
very special to earth.

18:19.150 --> 18:22.653
something which will assure
my conquest of the planet,

18:22.654 --> 18:27.023
as well as the destruction
of those meddling reptiles.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.691
i've got to warn
the guys.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.160
guys, it's april.
it's an emergency.

18:32.161 --> 18:33.295
what's wrong ?

18:33.296 --> 18:34.797
it's dregg. he's back.

18:34.798 --> 18:37.765
and he's building
some kind of a transporter

18:37.766 --> 18:39.801
in the old atlantic
steel mill.

18:39.802 --> 18:41.335
he's got some other
cronies with him

18:41.336 --> 18:43.336
and thousands of little...

18:43.337 --> 18:45.038
aaa--mmph.

18:45.039 --> 18:46.707
she's in trouble,
dudes !

18:46.708 --> 18:48.709
yeah, and so is
the rest of the world

18:48.710 --> 18:50.342
if dregg's up to
his usual stuff.

18:50.343 --> 18:52.411
looks like leonardo
will have to wait.

18:57.649 --> 18:59.517
it's done.

18:59.518 --> 19:02.686
and you, my fine
young specimen,

19:02.687 --> 19:04.889
shall be
its first occupant.

19:04.890 --> 19:07.024
no ! let me go !

19:11.629 --> 19:15.464
i hope you enjoy
your trip...

19:15.465 --> 19:17.165
to the other end
of the universe.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.871
oh, the turtles !

19:23.872 --> 19:27.140
that's teenage mutant
ninja turtles to you, pal !

19:27.141 --> 19:28.741
destroy them !

19:36.349 --> 19:37.416
carter ! whoa !

19:50.628 --> 19:53.595
michelangelo,
give me a fastball.

19:53.596 --> 19:55.130
low and outside, dude.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.636
got them.

20:01.637 --> 20:04.638
yeah, but who's
gonna get him ?!

20:05.840 --> 20:07.808
whoa !
look out !

20:12.045 --> 20:13.045
oh !

20:13.046 --> 20:14.314
whoa !
oh !

20:14.315 --> 20:15.315
cover me !

20:15.316 --> 20:18.383
i'm gonna cut this dummy
down to size.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.487
i got you covered,
dude. go for it !

20:27.125 --> 20:29.393
timber !

20:29.394 --> 20:30.993
have a nice trip !

20:30.994 --> 20:33.896
see you
next fall.

20:33.897 --> 20:35.698
whoa !
oh !

20:45.674 --> 20:48.142
place these fools
on the transporter

20:48.143 --> 20:49.008
with the girl.

20:56.816 --> 20:58.551
hey, where are you
sending us ?

20:58.552 --> 21:01.052
the center of the sun.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.522
oh, and me without my number
50 million sun block.

21:09.126 --> 21:10.928
oh !

21:15.999 --> 21:17.966
way to go, bud !

21:17.967 --> 21:19.935
cut us loose !

21:19.936 --> 21:21.502
thanks.

21:22.905 --> 21:24.539
get back.

21:33.247 --> 21:35.247
dregg's
getting away !

21:40.253 --> 21:41.853
what are you doing ?

21:41.854 --> 21:43.154
computer:
vortex crystal overload.

21:43.155 --> 21:45.155
meltdown in 10 seconds.

21:45.156 --> 21:47.091
i'm making sure
he never comes back.

21:47.092 --> 21:48.993
let's get out of here !

22:00.002 --> 22:02.504
forgive me,
lord dregg.

22:02.505 --> 22:05.005
i have failed you.

22:05.006 --> 22:06.507
on the contrary.

22:06.508 --> 22:09.009
everything went just
as i intended.

22:09.010 --> 22:10.410
ha ha ha ha !

22:10.411 --> 22:13.012
this piece of mutated
turtle shell

22:13.013 --> 22:17.516
will help me gain
unimaginable power.

22:17.517 --> 22:21.020
but--but what about
the vortex transporter ?

22:21.021 --> 22:23.488
how can you
build another ?

22:23.489 --> 22:27.025
easily. i kept
a spare piece of crystal

22:27.026 --> 22:29.659
and one microbot.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.028
oh, of course !

22:32.029 --> 22:34.531
one can build two...

22:34.532 --> 22:36.532
two can build four...

22:36.533 --> 22:39.769
and soon
i'll have billions !

22:39.770 --> 22:43.038
then i'll build another
vortex transporter,

22:43.039 --> 22:47.275
and the earth
will be mine !

22:48.543 --> 22:50.645
hey, i thought
you were leaving, carter.

22:50.646 --> 22:52.546
well, i've decided
to stick around

22:52.547 --> 22:55.148
until we find the antidote
to leonardo's mutation.

22:55.149 --> 22:57.150
hey, that's great news,
'cause we're sure

22:57.151 --> 23:00.119
gonna need major help
taming this beast.
