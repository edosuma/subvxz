00:34.188 --> 00:35.693
- Flowers!
- Yay!

00:35.724 --> 00:37.613
Thank you. They're
beautiful, baby. Thank you.

00:37.644 --> 00:39.917
- Yeah, you like it?
- Yeah.

00:39.948 --> 00:43.341
Did you pack?

00:43.373 --> 00:45.996
- Mm...
- Oh, come on, I left a note.

00:46.028 --> 00:48.365
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I saw the note, Carl.

00:48.397 --> 00:49.677
Uh...

00:49.709 --> 00:52.142
"Pack the cooler, pick out
a cute outfit for the road,

00:52.173 --> 00:55.053
and, hey, sneak in a winter jog
if you feel like it."

00:55.086 --> 00:57.261
The last part pissed me off,
so I didn't do anything.

00:57.294 --> 00:58.798
It was a josh!

01:02.479 --> 01:05.327
I'm really excited about
this weekend.

01:05.358 --> 01:08.590
Oh, God, don't.
You have bad breath.

01:08.623 --> 01:09.998
Disgusting.

01:19.376 --> 01:20.528
Super excited.

01:20.559 --> 01:22.448
Gonna give it to her this
weekend at a bed & breakfast.

01:22.479 --> 01:25.328
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thanks. Actually, we're

01:25.360 --> 01:28.593
We just were so broke back then
we couldn't afford the rings.

01:28.625 --> 01:31.632
I see. So, you had a cash bar
at the wedding and shit?

01:31.665 --> 01:35.056
Are you crazy?

01:35.089 --> 01:36.977
After 10, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39.346 --> 01:42.385
Dad! Fuck, please,
I'm with a client here.

01:42.418 --> 01:44.434
It looks very bad.

01:44.465 --> 01:45.553
Get in the back, please.
I'm sorry.

01:45.586 --> 01:48.594
- No...
- When they get older,

01:48.626 --> 01:50.675
He's like a little vegetable
with glasses.

01:56.146 --> 01:59.219
Ugh!

02:18.709 --> 02:21.652
Unh! Hey, have you guys heard

02:21.685 --> 02:24.341
anything about
the design position?

02:24.373 --> 02:26.613
Yes! You didn't get it.
They read

02:26.645 --> 02:28.853
the part on your resume
that says you're retarded.

02:28.886 --> 02:32.790
- Ah.
- But I did hear that

02:32.822 --> 02:35.702
- at E Arts in Vancouver.
- Here we go.

02:35.734 --> 02:38.550
Robyn Leffurn, yes.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.374
How is that boner machine?
- What?

02:40.407 --> 02:42.742
You know what
a boner machine is, right?

02:42.774 --> 02:46.647
- No.
- Oh. It's a machine that makes

02:48.375 --> 02:51.191
So, five years later and we're
still hearing about your ex.

02:51.223 --> 02:55.927
- Yeah, I'm aware.
- So, you excited

02:55.960 --> 02:57.848
Yes, I'm so excited.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.736
I'm... beyond.

02:59.768 --> 03:02.200
Ah, I'm jealous.
My weekend plans consist of

03:02.232 --> 03:04.632
trying to stop Doug
from eating wheat and sugar.

03:04.664 --> 03:06.968
- Diet?
- It's a yeast infection.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.361
We've been passing one back
and forth like a hot potato.

03:10.393 --> 03:13.753
That's nice.
It's nice to share.

03:13.784 --> 03:15.993
And with that,
I bid you adieu.

03:16.026 --> 03:19.290
- Bye.
- You have fun.

03:21.754 --> 03:25.562
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:25.594 --> 03:27.321
I don't know.

03:40.666 --> 03:43.707
Uh. Oh, now you're in for it.

04:03.229 --> 04:05.981
Fabulous conducting.
- Why, thank you.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.189
So, Ryan's

04:08.221 --> 04:11.902
emailed me the ski route
to Sainte-Adle for the

04:11.934 --> 04:13.950
It looks like it's gonna be
an awesome workout.

04:13.981 --> 04:18.204
Oh, cool, 'cause all I wanna
do this weekend is exercise.

04:18.238 --> 04:22.303
That he gave us the best room
in the B&B, the Lovers' Suite?

04:22.334 --> 04:25.183
- That's what it's called?
- That's what it's called.

04:27.007 --> 04:28.992
So, still no word yet

04:29.023 --> 04:31.071
on the promotion.
Can you believe that?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.216
- When are they gonna decide?
- They can't keep me

04:33.247 --> 04:36.896
on the floor
forever. It's like...

04:36.927 --> 04:39.008
on local cheeses
while we're here.

04:39.039 --> 04:41.504
Local cheeses!

04:41.536 --> 04:44.864
Let's get some cheese
up in this bitch.

04:57.249 --> 05:01.058
Is there where you murder me
and stuff me in the trunk?

05:01.090 --> 05:03.810
This is where we tear
each other's clothes off

05:03.842 --> 05:06.370
and make passionate love
to each other.

05:06.402 --> 05:08.674
- Oooh.
- Yeah.

05:10.563 --> 05:12.994
All right, let me
just pee first.

05:17.411 --> 05:19.075
Ah!

05:28.932 --> 05:30.596
Hey!

05:32.484 --> 05:34.148
Do we have any Kleenex?

05:34.181 --> 05:36.517
Uh...

05:36.548 --> 05:38.629
there's a paper bag
back here.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.229
Ew!

05:40.261 --> 05:42.149
I think I have a receipt
in my wallet.

05:42.181 --> 05:43.941
- Hilarious.
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Hurry up!

05:43.974 --> 05:46.533
How'd you know
this place was here?

05:46.565 --> 05:48.198
Uh... all these vin...

05:48.229 --> 05:51.718
these little vineyards have
hideaways like this.

05:53.446 --> 05:56.133
Drip dry.

05:56.166 --> 05:59.206
Ah!

05:59.239 --> 06:00.295
Don't slam the door.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.926
Why do you always slam the door?
That's a woman thing.

06:01.958 --> 06:05.383
Oh, is the car gonna break,
Carl? Is it gonna break?

06:05.415 --> 06:07.654
Here, take one of these.
Can you put the pumps on?

06:07.687 --> 06:09.383
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

06:09.415 --> 06:11.720
Put 'em on, put 'em on,
put 'em on.

06:13.447 --> 06:15.464
Mmm. Watch the seats. Here.

06:15.496 --> 06:18.536
No, no, no.
I wanna keep it on.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.457
No, I just got a really
not so great bikini wax.

06:20.488 --> 06:22.856
Yeah, I don't care, I don't
care about the little bumps.

06:22.888 --> 06:24.648
From behind.

06:24.681 --> 06:27.497
- Ow!
- Ooh, uh, sorry. OK, ready?

06:27.528 --> 06:29.065
Yeah.

06:30.729 --> 06:33.097
Oh, God.
- 'K, let's come fast, OK?

06:33.129 --> 06:35.337
Please don't take
like half an hour again.

06:35.369 --> 06:37.417
OK.

06:37.449 --> 06:39.178
Oh, God.

06:39.209 --> 06:41.610
Oh, fuck. Shit, Sue.

06:41.642 --> 06:42.826
Ah.

06:42.858 --> 06:45.097
Oh, does it feel good?
- Yeah.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.826
- Yeah, you fuckin' like that?
- Yeah.

06:46.858 --> 06:49.099
- Yeah, you fuckin' like that?
- Carl, shut up. Yes.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.858
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:55.691 --> 06:57.804
You can do it, Carl.

07:03.532 --> 07:06.380
Tell me how you were
waiting for me.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.940
Uh, OK. Um...

07:08.972 --> 07:11.341
So, you're on a skidoo,

07:11.372 --> 07:15.340
and, uh, you come across me
in the forest,

07:15.373 --> 07:19.501
a little ski bunny that needs
a big lollipop to suck.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.741
Oh, hello.

07:21.773 --> 07:24.014
Can I give you a ride?

07:24.045 --> 07:25.389
Yeah, OK.

07:25.421 --> 07:29.870
Um, I'm your wife's dumber
and hornier cousin from Italy.

07:29.902 --> 07:32.463
Uh, me no speak-a no English.
- Oh, don't do that.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.670
- Me no speak-a English.
- Why are you doing that?

07:34.702 --> 07:38.223
Sorry. You wanna spray
my snowsuit?

07:38.255 --> 07:40.494
Oh, yeah,
spray your face.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.223
And, uh, luckily,

07:42.255 --> 07:45.904
you put my hand on a language
everybody understands:

07:45.935 --> 07:48.303
A big, hard, throbbing

07:48.335 --> 07:50.128
American cock.

08:00.497 --> 08:02.576
I'm sorry,
I just couldn't...

08:02.609 --> 08:04.945
It's OK.

08:04.977 --> 08:07.376
It's nice to get the feeling
back in my legs.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.668
This is adorable!
- Yeah, you like it?

08:43.700 --> 08:46.740
- Yeah. Eee!
- Head on in,

08:46.772 --> 08:49.748
I'll get the bags.
- Thank God for my sweater.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.668
Yeah, bitch.

09:26.039 --> 09:28.632
The one thing I won't renovate
is the Lovers' Suite.

09:28.664 --> 09:30.903
I mean, you'll see.
It has so much charm,

09:30.936 --> 09:33.528
- it's like going back in time.
- Cool, cool.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.113
So, should I take the stairs,
or my DeLorean to get there?

09:47.642 --> 09:50.361
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

09:50.392 --> 09:53.594
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

09:53.626 --> 09:55.130
What the hell are you
doing here?

09:55.161 --> 09:57.946
What's the deal?
You guys know each other?

09:57.977 --> 10:00.346
Yeah, uh... Yeah, uh,

10:00.378 --> 10:02.970
Robyn used to be my boss.
- Really?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.530
- Yeah.
- Wait. Robyn?

10:05.562 --> 10:08.250
I thought... Robyn?
I thought your name was Ryan.

10:08.283 --> 10:12.859
Whoa. You're Ryan?
You're the Ryan I've

10:12.891 --> 10:15.931
I can't believe
that you're the Carl.

10:15.964 --> 10:19.579
I mean, you are an excellent
speller, by the way.

10:22.588 --> 10:24.476
Well, jeez, come here.
I mean, it's

10:24.508 --> 10:26.524
amazing to see you. It's, uh...
- Yeah.

10:33.053 --> 10:34.045
Hi, I'm Sue,

10:34.077 --> 10:36.221
this man's wife.
- Yes, wife, her.

10:36.253 --> 10:37.469
Yeah.

10:37.501 --> 10:39.678
Hi.
- You are stunning.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.565
- Oh.
- I mean, really.

10:41.598 --> 10:43.485
You walked through the door,
and I was like,

10:43.518 --> 10:45.406
"Wow. Am I working
at a supermodel agency?"

10:45.438 --> 10:48.830
Oh, my God. Thank you.

10:48.861 --> 10:50.206
Can we rewind
real quick?

10:50.239 --> 10:53.566
Why are you
calling yourself Ryan?

10:55.519 --> 10:57.055
That's really embarrassing.

10:57.087 --> 11:02.239
Um, I guess that it's
just all part of the new me,

11:02.271 --> 11:03.967
along with simple problems

11:03.999 --> 11:08.256
like fixing broken
drainage pipes and making beds.

11:08.288 --> 11:10.400
I don't...
I don't get it.

11:10.432 --> 11:14.145
I bought this place.

11:14.176 --> 11:17.409
You what?

11:18.688 --> 11:20.385
What about Vancouver?

11:20.416 --> 11:23.841
Your job? Did I hear you quit?
- Ah, I just needed a break.

11:23.873 --> 11:26.722
I mean, the plan is
to give this lodge a facelift

11:26.753 --> 11:29.217
and then give it to my parents
as a retirement gift.

11:29.249 --> 11:31.458
- Wow, that's amazing of you.
- I have no idea

11:31.489 --> 11:33.442
what I'm doing.

11:33.474 --> 11:34.818
Like, I am learning,

11:34.849 --> 11:37.091
one hammered thumb at a time.
- So, what,

11:37.122 --> 11:39.203
it's been like five years
last October?

11:39.234 --> 11:41.378
I think, I think.
- Oh, uh,

11:41.411 --> 11:44.003
or something like that.
- Yeah. You look great.

11:44.035 --> 11:46.211
Oh, my God.
I'm totally breaking out.

11:46.243 --> 11:49.699
I mean, flashback to grade 10
yearbook photo. Mortified.

11:51.684 --> 11:53.571
Let me get the room key.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.332
Shit. This is work.
It's a file error.

12:03.364 --> 12:06.564
- Sounds interesting.
- I'll help Susan with the bags.

12:06.596 --> 12:08.452
It's Sue. Sue.

12:08.485 --> 12:12.100
Haven't changed my name yet.

12:19.301 --> 12:21.446
Hmm.

12:23.174 --> 12:24.869
Hey.

12:24.902 --> 12:27.845
Is here, at the fucking lodge
we're staying at!

12:27.878 --> 12:31.622
What the fuck?!
Oh, my God, what?!

12:31.654 --> 12:34.919
Excuse me, lady,
what occurred here?

12:34.950 --> 12:37.287
Is this turning you on? Should
I call the wet police? What?

12:37.319 --> 12:39.174
Carl, where are you?

12:39.207 --> 12:41.608
I'm in the Laurentians.

12:41.639 --> 12:44.135
I don't know. I'm at, uh,
just some area here.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.111
Oh, my God, Carl.

12:47.144 --> 12:49.639
- Stacey, just... just stop.
- No. No!

12:49.672 --> 12:52.040
No, no, no, no, no.
I can explain this, OK?

12:52.073 --> 12:53.736
Consider this your cold
shower, Your Horniness.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.552
What is she
doing there anyway?

12:56.584 --> 13:00.104
With the owner, and the owner
turns out to be her.

13:00.137 --> 13:02.601
She bought a ski lodge? What?
- I mean, of all the ski lodges,

13:02.634 --> 13:05.481
why the fuck
would she buy this one?

13:05.514 --> 13:08.937
Ask you the same question.
Why? Why, out of the all the ski

13:08.969 --> 13:11.049
- Take Sue where?
- Doug, you gotta shut up.

13:11.081 --> 13:14.122
No, you better
shut your fuckin' mouth.

13:14.154 --> 13:16.617
Perfect lately, and...
and I just thought

13:16.650 --> 13:18.698
that this might spark something
for us, you know?

13:25.643 --> 13:28.652
Apply this.
- Aha, OK.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.731
But so we're clear,
it was your oven

13:30.764 --> 13:33.323
that leavened my bread.
- Carl?

13:33.356 --> 13:35.756
- Yeah, what was I saying?
- [Um, something about

13:35.787 --> 13:37.899
to a ski lodge that was
your romantic getaway

13:37.931 --> 13:42.124
with another woman.
- What?!

13:42.156 --> 13:44.748
We should leave. I should
cancel the trip, shouldn't I?

13:44.781 --> 13:48.204
What are you gonna tell her?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.149
You get back in there,
you have the weekend

13:51.180 --> 13:54.125
you planned, because that is
all you can do, Carl.

13:54.156 --> 13:56.269
Just answer your phone.

14:29.872 --> 14:31.536
: Hi.

14:31.568 --> 14:33.265
Hey. What do you think?

14:33.296 --> 14:35.185
- I love it.
- Yeah, it's great, right?

14:35.216 --> 14:37.424
- Is everything good at work?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.456 --> 14:40.497
I sorted out the, uh,
file error.

14:40.529 --> 14:42.737
The reception sucks
up here, though.

14:42.769 --> 14:45.650
Isn't this place cute,
Carlito's Way?

14:45.681 --> 14:47.057
Answer: Yes.

14:48.657 --> 14:52.338
Hey, uh, you're not gonna
believe this. I forgot my boots.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.290
- You're kidding me.
- It's all these heels

14:54.322 --> 14:57.010
you made me bring,
you fuckin' perv.

14:57.042 --> 15:01.203
Shit. We'll just go into town
tomorrow and we'll get you

15:01.234 --> 15:04.979
Um, hey, do you want to go
into town tonight maybe?

15:05.010 --> 15:06.931
And get dinner?

15:06.963 --> 15:09.460
Really? You've been talking

15:09.491 --> 15:11.795
about this place's
confit de canard all week.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.524
Well, I don't know.

15:13.555 --> 15:15.667
I don't wanna get
back in the car, babe.

15:15.700 --> 15:19.220
It's dark and we don't know
where we're going.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.916
Hey, uh, what...

15:20.948 --> 15:23.476
what... what was your deal
down there?

15:23.508 --> 15:25.589
Why were you acting so weird?
- Is this shirt...

15:25.621 --> 15:27.829
is this too urban?
What do you think?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.164
Would you just stand still
for a second? What's your deal

15:30.197 --> 15:32.533
with Ryan - Robyn?

15:32.565 --> 15:36.981
What is that?
- Oh. Uh... yeah.

15:37.013 --> 15:41.397
Well, full disclosure:
We used to date.

15:41.430 --> 15:43.862
...inanimate
objects. I...

15:46.966 --> 15:49.078
Robyn dated you?

15:50.806 --> 15:53.366
The tone seems
like you're shocked.

15:53.399 --> 15:56.727
Well, how long
did you guys go out for?

15:56.759 --> 15:58.647
I don't know. Honestly, I don't
really remember.

15:58.679 --> 16:01.879
I was mostly just shocked
at how much she's aged.

16:01.911 --> 16:03.608
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

16:03.639 --> 16:06.359
She's beautiful.
I... I can't imagine

16:06.392 --> 16:09.208
what she looked like before
if she's aged.

16:09.240 --> 16:13.144
She's OK. She's not, uh...
ho-ho-ho!

16:15.737 --> 16:17.849
So, why have I never heard
of this person before?

16:17.880 --> 16:21.721
Oh, no, I have definitely
mentioned her before. You

16:21.753 --> 16:24.409
No. No, no.
You never mentioned her.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.841
Well, it just never came up.
You know.

16:26.873 --> 16:30.490
Younger people talk
about their exes. That's

16:32.058 --> 16:34.970
So, I'm assuming
that you slept with her?

16:35.003 --> 16:37.883
We were adults
at the time,

16:37.915 --> 16:40.475
so yeah.
- Amazing.

16:40.507 --> 16:42.203
But it was
totally forgettable.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.475
I mean, she's just...
she's one of those pretty women

16:44.507 --> 16:46.236
who doesn't know
how to be sexy.

16:46.267 --> 16:49.596
And for the record, I had no
idea that I was emailing

16:49.627 --> 16:54.844
She was signing her emails
"Ryan," which is just bizarre.

16:54.877 --> 16:55.804
Who does that?

16:55.837 --> 16:57.564
I don't know. Ryan.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.501
All right, well...
- Well, hold on.

17:05.532 --> 17:10.141
I mean, she must have known
that she was emailing

17:10.173 --> 17:11.582
No, I used
my Hotmail account.

17:11.613 --> 17:15.006
I use my Hotmail account
when I book to avoid spam.

17:17.693 --> 17:18.493
This is weird.

17:18.526 --> 17:21.117
We should... we should
change lodges.

17:21.150 --> 17:23.038
No, it's nobody's fault.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.086
I understand.
It must be

17:25.118 --> 17:27.839
super weird running into her.
- I want you to be comfortable.

17:27.869 --> 17:29.759
- No, I... Yeah.
- I want you to be comfortable,

17:29.790 --> 17:32.223
and I want this weekend
to be awesome.

17:32.254 --> 17:33.791
- I'm fine if you are.
- Really?

17:33.823 --> 17:36.863
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're amazing.

17:36.895 --> 17:40.351
I know I am.
I am soooo cool.

17:40.384 --> 17:42.112
You're not cool.

17:42.144 --> 17:46.176
You're amazing. This sweater
does not make you cool.

17:50.785 --> 17:53.088
All right, all right.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.833
Get the door.
Just watch your head.

17:56.864 --> 17:57.953
- Seriously, stop it.
- Feel the rhythm.

17:57.985 --> 18:01.601
Stop making me laugh.
I will drop you, I swear to God.

18:10.146 --> 18:12.354
- Bonjour.
- Bonsoir.

18:12.386 --> 18:14.914
Bonsoir.

18:14.947 --> 18:17.667
: What the fuck?

18:17.698 --> 18:20.227
- What's up? Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:24.579 --> 18:27.715
No, no, no, no.

18:27.747 --> 18:30.020
Are you staying here?

18:31.908 --> 18:33.796
Oh, bonjour. Je suis Sue.

18:33.828 --> 18:35.940
- Lise Winters. Enchantée.
- Enchantée.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.557
- Enchantée.
- Hi!

18:39.588 --> 18:41.604
Hi! Mwah, mwah!
I'm Carl.

18:41.637 --> 18:43.653
- Carl. This is Carl.
- Hey, how's it going?

18:43.685 --> 18:47.685
Hey. Oh, hey. You too.
- Please, sit, sit. It would

18:47.717 --> 18:49.797
- Really? Yeah?
- Ah, yes, join us.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.621
OK. All right. Uh...

18:56.070 --> 18:57.958
Carl's American,
hence the perfect accent.

18:57.990 --> 19:00.517
Well, I wish I could
play music, but...

19:00.550 --> 19:02.918
Babe, Anatolii is
an actor.

19:02.951 --> 19:04.998
He's amazing.
I just saw that, uh,

19:05.030 --> 19:06.887
that French film you did.
You were...

19:06.918 --> 19:09.415
- Naked for most of it.
- That too.

19:09.447 --> 19:13.320
- Ah, he was naked.
- I'll take the credit.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.399
- Well done. Good body.
- Ha, ha. Well,

19:15.432 --> 19:17.799
well, I'm already a fan
of your turtleneck,

19:17.831 --> 19:19.623
so I'm sure... so I'm sure

19:19.656 --> 19:21.384
I'd be a fan
of your work.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.752
Do you guys have any, uh,
any plan for the weekend, or?

19:23.785 --> 19:26.888
Oh, yes. We are
going on a vineyard tour.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.545
A hard look at what activities
we both enjoy...

19:32.457 --> 19:34.921
Sounds good.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.122
Shut up. I love her.
- Oh, I adore her.

19:50.154 --> 19:52.234
- I love her.
- Who is she?

20:04.075 --> 20:06.924
Wow.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.972
Well, it sounds compelling.

20:13.740 --> 20:17.036
- Yeah, excellent.
- I like your pumps. I have

20:17.068 --> 20:20.365
I have to pee! Sorry, I have
to get the pee out of my body.

20:20.397 --> 20:22.028
Preferably in a toilet.

20:22.061 --> 20:25.485
Um, upstairs, first door
on the left.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.405
Fantastic.
All right, I'll be back.

20:27.437 --> 20:29.549
: I'll
be back.

20:29.581 --> 20:31.886
Let me clear
your plates.

20:48.687 --> 20:51.375
- Hi. Tell me everything.
- She seems like she's doing

20:51.407 --> 20:53.231
really great. She's still
the most annoying person

20:53.264 --> 20:56.655
Is she still a boner machine?

20:56.687 --> 20:59.279
But it's funny, I can
see why it didn't work out.

20:59.312 --> 21:02.577
No... Babe, I can't
hear anything. What should I do?

21:02.608 --> 21:06.288
I think you should shut the
fuck up while I'm doing yoga.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.272
Carl?

21:08.305 --> 21:09.969
I need you, OK? I need...

21:10.000 --> 21:11.825
Wait a second, what?

21:11.856 --> 21:16.785
...emergency.
- Huh? What do you mean

21:16.817 --> 21:18.705
...emergency.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.786
I gotta go.

21:20.818 --> 21:23.473
Oh. Sorry.

21:23.506 --> 21:26.930
Don't say you're sorry, man.
It's a sign of weakness.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.770
Thanks for the tip.

21:37.427 --> 21:39.347
Hello?

21:41.427 --> 21:43.667
I call that
a perfect dismount,

21:43.699 --> 21:45.587
no thanks to you
and your mouth.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.252
What the fuck?

21:54.164 --> 21:56.437
Oh, my God.

21:58.837 --> 22:01.109
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:01.141 --> 22:03.285
Ryan's gonna eat with us.
- Oh.

22:03.317 --> 22:05.301
I... I don't want
to spoil your dinner.

22:05.333 --> 22:08.469
No, you're not, you're not.
She's was gonna eat alone

22:08.501 --> 22:11.926
I've run out of conversation
topics with the fridge

22:11.957 --> 22:15.190
- Ah.
- Relax, Carl. Sit.

22:15.221 --> 22:16.950
Yeah, yes.

22:16.982 --> 22:19.415
Let's relax.

22:19.446 --> 22:23.766
Mm, so, this is
a local cabernet,

22:23.799 --> 22:25.782
and it goes best
with the entire bottle.

22:25.815 --> 22:28.503
Would you like some?
- Oh, no thanks. I don't drink.

22:28.535 --> 22:32.023
- OK.
- No, I'm good,

22:32.056 --> 22:35.832
a question. Why does Anatolii
have a different accent

22:35.864 --> 22:38.712
He's been working in France
since he was a teenager.

22:38.744 --> 22:41.561
He's still a teenager.

22:41.592 --> 22:44.760
- Jailbait.
- Word.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.904
Gross. Both of you.
Very gross.

22:49.337 --> 22:52.217
So... can you believe

22:52.249 --> 22:54.425
that I'm sitting here with you

22:54.457 --> 22:58.714
and your drop-dead-gorgeous
wife?

22:58.746 --> 23:00.634
It's pretty surreal.

23:00.666 --> 23:03.290
So, tell me,
how are things at work?

23:03.321 --> 23:05.882
- Yeah, good.
- I mean,

23:05.914 --> 23:07.706
you must be...

23:07.738 --> 23:10.810
one of the top dogs
by now, no?

23:12.538 --> 23:14.906
Well, you know,
there's a lot of, uh...

23:14.938 --> 23:17.818
politics there, and we're not
really developing anything new.

23:17.851 --> 23:21.755
Why... am I defending myself?

23:21.788 --> 23:23.740
You're doing great, baby.

23:23.772 --> 23:25.660
So, uh, so,

23:25.692 --> 23:28.187
riddle me this:
What's your deal?

23:28.220 --> 23:30.972
Are you single? Divorced?
Are you, uh...

23:31.004 --> 23:32.892
Is there a Mr. Ryan

23:32.924 --> 23:35.613
back in, uh, BC,
or what?

23:35.644 --> 23:37.821
I am...

23:37.852 --> 23:40.253
comically single.

23:40.285 --> 23:42.365
So, you never settled down?

23:42.397 --> 23:43.709
Well,

23:43.740 --> 23:47.101
I recently made the mistake
of dating someone from work,

23:47.134 --> 23:49.662
and when it started
to fizzle,

23:49.694 --> 23:52.189
he started talking
about our private life

23:52.222 --> 23:55.870
in front of everyone,
and completely humiliated me,

23:55.902 --> 23:58.751
and ejaculated
all over my office.

23:58.782 --> 24:01.854
- Are you serious?
- He masturbated

24:01.886 --> 24:04.319
into a picture frame
and left it on my desk.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.399
: Oh!

24:08.127 --> 24:10.944
Romantic. Wow. I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

24:10.976 --> 24:12.927
- Awful.
- Yeah.

24:12.960 --> 24:17.024
I was never cut out
for a husband and kids.

24:17.055 --> 24:18.752
I'm a loner.

24:18.784 --> 24:21.792
Yeah, you're
like Julian Assange,

24:21.824 --> 24:24.673
living out of a backpack
and changing the world, right?

24:24.704 --> 24:27.585
- Who's Julian Assange again?
- Ah.

24:27.616 --> 24:30.721
Twenty-four-year-olds get their
news from Perez Hilton, so...

24:30.753 --> 24:34.561
Julian Assange is WikiLeaks.
He's the guy who...

24:34.593 --> 24:36.802
Yeah, I know what it is, Carl.
I just forgot his name.

24:36.833 --> 24:39.650
- You're cute.
- Fuck you.

24:47.778 --> 24:50.274
Did you notice
that she didn't ask us

24:50.307 --> 24:52.482
one single question
at that meal?

24:52.515 --> 24:55.267
It was completely 100%
about her, like the whole time.

24:55.299 --> 24:57.507
- I know.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.395
Unbelievable.

24:59.427 --> 25:01.475
It seems like she has
a very interesting life.

25:01.507 --> 25:04.387
Nobody's ever jacked off
into one of my picture frames.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.468
I'll jack off
in your picture frame.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.708
: Carl, get off.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.756
I'll hit you.
- Uh, also,

25:10.788 --> 25:13.253
what right does she have
to criticize me about my work?

25:13.285 --> 25:16.325
It's like, I'm sorry, Ryan,
if I'm not as successful

25:16.357 --> 25:19.974
- She's so skinny.
- Yeah.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.549
Are you still
attracted to me?

25:24.581 --> 25:26.277
Am I still
attracted to you?

25:26.310 --> 25:29.317
Are you kidding me?
You're like perfect.

25:29.349 --> 25:32.198
- I need to work out more.
- No, you don't.

25:32.229 --> 25:35.910
What are you talking about?
I'm so attracted to you.

25:35.942 --> 25:38.151
Look at me,
look at that.

25:38.182 --> 25:40.390
We could camp under it.

25:40.423 --> 25:42.631
Yeah.
- It's a cool cock, babe.

25:42.663 --> 25:44.551
- Thanks.
- Cool.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.792
- Well...
- Cool stuff.

25:46.823 --> 25:48.712
Honk.
- Mm.

25:48.743 --> 25:50.824
Honking a boner.
Doesn't quite work.

25:50.855 --> 25:52.552
Yeah.

26:00.264 --> 26:02.313
Hey, hey,
did you see this?

26:02.345 --> 26:04.392
Have you seen this?

26:04.425 --> 26:06.792
No, what am I looking at?
What is that?

26:06.825 --> 26:08.520
We should
carve our names into it.

26:08.553 --> 26:11.401
- No.
- Look, Sailor

26:11.433 --> 26:13.674
- No, I don't like it.
- Why not? Come on.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.754
It's like... it's like
defacing the place.

26:15.786 --> 26:17.674
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not joking.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.594
You're such a wiener.
Who are you?

26:19.626 --> 26:22.314
- I didn't bring a knife, hon.
- I'm sure we can find a knife.

26:22.346 --> 26:25.098
No, it's cheesy. Mmm.

26:30.187 --> 26:32.075
I'm tired. I'm just tired.

26:32.107 --> 26:35.403
We haven't even christened
the room yet.

26:35.435 --> 26:39.243
OK, I know, but I just feel
like one failed attempt

26:39.275 --> 26:42.027
in one day is enough for me,
you know what I mean?

26:42.060 --> 26:44.396
Is that OK?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.636
- That was bitchy.
- Babe.

26:46.668 --> 26:50.060
No, I didn't realize I was
vacationing with a cold fish.

26:51.948 --> 26:55.276
Wow. Really?

26:55.309 --> 26:57.484
I'm sorry,
I'm just disappointed.

26:59.277 --> 27:02.126
You know what, if it was gonna
be fast, I'd be down,

27:02.157 --> 27:04.781
but lately sex has become
such a production with you.

27:04.814 --> 27:08.622
It's annoying that I always have
to recite that fantasy

27:08.654 --> 27:10.958
in this baby porno voice.
- You don't have to dissect

27:10.990 --> 27:14.734
our sex lives. OK, you like
specific shit too.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.775
- Yeah, sure, I do, but...
- Yeah, I know you do!

27:17.806 --> 27:19.566
- Yeah!
- Your tastes are very

27:19.599 --> 27:21.486
repetitive. I feel
like I'm in a Broadway play

27:21.519 --> 27:25.007
that's been running for 3 years.
- Bravo, babe.

27:26.543 --> 27:28.975
Sometimes a woman just needs
to be fucked by her man,

27:29.008 --> 27:32.911
so she feels
like he can't help it.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.864
Preferably in under an hour.

27:39.024 --> 27:41.520
I'm sorry
I'm so inadequate.

27:45.777 --> 27:49.073
This is a good look.

27:49.105 --> 27:51.153
Let's just watch some Conan
and go to bed.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.569
Ha!

29:20.600 --> 29:22.585
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey.

29:22.616 --> 29:24.089
Hey.

29:24.121 --> 29:26.137
Aw, geez Louise,
you look beautiful.

29:26.169 --> 29:28.570
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.650
And you lost
your dead grandma's sweater.

29:30.682 --> 29:34.202
Thank you so much.
You're so sweet. I love them.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.450
What do you love?

29:35.482 --> 29:38.073
* Da-da-da ding, da-da-da-da
ding, ding ding-ding-a-ding *

29:38.106 --> 29:39.578
Where'd you get those?

29:39.610 --> 29:42.842
Am I interrupting
a make-out session?

29:42.874 --> 29:45.018
No, no making out,

29:45.051 --> 29:46.522
as far as I'm aware.

29:46.554 --> 29:48.282
Tell me they fit.

29:50.011 --> 29:52.410
Wait a sec,
you got these for me?

29:52.443 --> 29:55.867
I mean, I had to go
into town anyway, so...

29:55.900 --> 29:58.555
Wow.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.963
How did you know
that she needed boots?

29:59.995 --> 30:03.740
Oh, the rooms are bugged.

30:03.772 --> 30:05.213
: I'm just kidding.

30:05.244 --> 30:07.133
Sue told me last night.
- I can't believe

30:07.165 --> 30:10.845
you did that. That's, like,
the sweetest thing ever.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.765
Prego, grazie, it's not-a

30:12.797 --> 30:14.973
big-a deal.

30:15.005 --> 30:18.269
- Uh, what's with the pails?
- Oh, I'm going to the maple

30:18.301 --> 30:21.693
syrup factory. I mean, the barn
with a couple of pots in it.

30:21.726 --> 30:24.606
- You make your own maple syrup?
- Well,

30:24.638 --> 30:30.079
it's a dream my dad had,
so I'm trying to figure it out.

30:30.110 --> 30:31.327
You do, like,
everything.

30:31.358 --> 30:33.247
Yeah, that's, like...
that's wild.

30:33.278 --> 30:35.199
- Is it a complicated process?
- If you

30:35.230 --> 30:37.855
help me out, I'll teach you
everything I know.

30:37.887 --> 30:41.663
We'll be
two and a half minutes, Carl.

30:41.696 --> 30:43.456
- Very funny.
- Yeah, I mean, I could...

30:43.487 --> 30:45.376
You should go, yeah.
I'll wax the skis up.

30:45.407 --> 30:48.800
- OK.
- Yeah. Have fun. Don't fall in.

30:51.168 --> 30:53.568
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:17.890 --> 31:19.842
OK, then.

31:29.604 --> 31:33.795
No.

31:39.172 --> 31:41.828
- Bon matin.
- Yeah, hi.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.909
- We are here!
- What the fuck

31:43.941 --> 31:46.789
- We are... here!
- What do you think we're

31:46.821 --> 31:49.477
- Seriously, what the fuck?!
- You said it was an emergency.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.749
I didn't ask you to come
the fuck up here!

31:51.781 --> 31:55.333
Yes, you did, you did.
You said, "Stace, I need

31:55.365 --> 31:57.350
- We came.
- I didn't say that.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.422
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't say that. But

32:00.454 --> 32:02.789
OK. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
OK, Doug, let's go, let's go.

32:02.822 --> 32:05.669
OK, yeah, yeah, I'll just get
my chauffeur hat.

32:05.702 --> 32:08.710
You know, I really...
Can I please pee? 'Cause

32:08.742 --> 32:10.630
I'd prefer it if you get
in the fucking Jeep and go.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.743
Guess how many times
we stopped on the way here.

32:12.775 --> 32:14.823
- I don't give a shit!
- Five times.

32:14.855 --> 32:16.999
OK, you've got the bladder
of an 80-year-old man.

32:17.031 --> 32:20.615
Is that her?

32:20.647 --> 32:22.792
She's a fuckin' babe.
- My God.

32:22.823 --> 32:25.352
That megalomaniac hasn't aged
a day.

32:25.384 --> 32:27.336
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:27.368 --> 32:29.384
: Hey, hey, hey.

32:29.416 --> 32:31.400
Did you guys make some syrup?
- Yeah.

32:31.432 --> 32:36.616
How was the, uh, the sugar -
with the maples? The...

32:36.648 --> 32:40.554
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing here?

32:40.585 --> 32:42.281
Oh, nothing.

32:42.313 --> 32:44.201
Yeah, they, uh...

32:44.233 --> 32:45.929
drove up here...

32:45.961 --> 32:49.737
And they're here,
at the lodge we're staying at.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.657
Wait a second.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.929
Stacey Humes?

32:53.962 --> 32:56.938
- Heeey!
- Wow,

32:56.971 --> 33:00.106
you look terrific.

33:00.139 --> 33:02.122
- Oh, thanks.
- Mwah.

33:02.155 --> 33:05.259
Exactly the same.
- Actually I just

33:05.290 --> 33:07.915
- Oh, nice.
- Douglas Reginald.

33:07.947 --> 33:10.796
Your acquaintance.
- Ah, the man who made

33:10.827 --> 33:14.572
- Yeah.
- The reservation?

33:14.603 --> 33:17.356
Going on here.
What's going on here?

33:17.388 --> 33:21.933
Could you escort me to a john?
I need to do a bladder drainage

33:21.964 --> 33:25.293
Let me get my surgical gloves.
Follow me.

33:25.324 --> 33:28.396
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
This is just so ridiculous.

33:28.428 --> 33:31.917
They're insisting on tweaks
for the distributor meeting

33:31.949 --> 33:34.350
on Monday, and I've been
trying to reach you,

33:34.381 --> 33:36.622
but I couldn't get you, so...
- The cell reception's terrible.

33:36.653 --> 33:41.102
And also we're on our getaway.
That's 'cause we wanted to get

33:41.134 --> 33:45.071
- Get away!
- What kind of tweaks?

33:45.102 --> 33:47.887
The dark prince's underbite.
He's like...

33:47.918 --> 33:50.063
- Yeah.
- They said, "He'd be able

33:50.095 --> 33:52.175
to afford orthodontic work -
he's a prince," and I was said,

33:52.206 --> 33:55.727
"OK, why don't you eat
each other's assholes instead?"

33:55.759 --> 33:57.967
- That's a good comeback.
- I wouldn't

33:57.999 --> 34:00.624
have bugged you if it weren't
for the promotion, right?

34:00.655 --> 34:02.736
'Cause I know how much
that means to you.

34:02.767 --> 34:04.176
Yeah, it means a lot.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.096
And you decided
to stay the night?

34:06.128 --> 34:07.824
No! No, of course not.

34:07.855 --> 34:10.543
- That's fun, that's fun.
- No. No.

34:10.576 --> 34:13.328
We're gonna do the work,
Doug's gonna piss a few times,

34:13.360 --> 34:15.601
and we're gonna leave.
- Good morning.

34:15.632 --> 34:17.745
- Oh, great.
- I didn't know

34:17.777 --> 34:19.665
- you had friends coming up.
- Neither did we.

34:19.697 --> 34:21.681
Yeah. Stacey, je presente

34:21.713 --> 34:25.681
Lise et Anatalie.
- It's Anatolii.

34:25.713 --> 34:27.281
I know who you are
and I love you.

34:27.313 --> 34:31.186
Are you guys still going
on that vineyard tour?

34:31.217 --> 34:34.610
On a ski route that links
all the wineries.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.723
Please come. It will be
so chill if we're all together.

34:36.755 --> 34:38.802
Uh, no, no, no, they have
their own plans, dear.

34:38.835 --> 34:42.034
- We do.
- You know what? Plans recently

34:42.065 --> 34:44.915
changed, so I'm in.

34:44.947 --> 34:47.699
- Babe, you don't even drink.
- I can try

34:47.731 --> 34:49.523
the local cheeses.

34:49.554 --> 34:52.179
You're obsessed
with cheese.

34:55.795 --> 34:59.604
Hey, hey. I'm... I'm sorry.
I thought we were going

34:59.635 --> 35:02.036
Right. See, I don't give
a shit about rocks, though.

35:02.069 --> 35:04.757
I am so sorry about all...
about this. It's crazy.

35:04.789 --> 35:06.901
How could you forget to take
the dark prince's

35:06.932 --> 35:08.885
socioeconomic background
into consideration, Carl?

35:08.917 --> 35:11.765
You don't take
my work seriously.

35:11.797 --> 35:14.198
You don't. You barely asked me
about my promotion. It was a...

35:14.229 --> 35:16.118
You said
you didn't get it yet.

35:16.150 --> 35:18.006
Yeah, I know!

35:19.542 --> 35:21.686
What do you want me
to do here? I'm...

35:21.717 --> 35:26.167
Oh, I want you to go hang out
with your BFF who can't leave

35:26.198 --> 35:29.559
I'll be wine tasting
with your ex.

35:29.591 --> 35:31.863
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.007
Well, I guess we can put off
the work and tag along.

35:38.039 --> 35:40.120
I mean, I heard there's
some really good cabernets...

35:40.152 --> 35:43.767
- What work, Stacey?!
- The... fake work.

35:43.799 --> 35:46.968
Well, excuse me for trying
to make the most of the trip.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.400
* Everywhere

35:53.432 --> 35:56.280
* That we go

35:56.313 --> 35:59.129
* Everywhere

35:59.160 --> 36:02.266
* That we go

36:02.298 --> 36:05.530
* Seein' warm

36:05.561 --> 36:07.642
* People

36:07.673 --> 36:12.827
* Feel the positive pole

36:15.418 --> 36:17.114
* Yes oh yes, but so...

36:18.842 --> 36:20.731
Sue, give me your skis;
I'll lock 'em together.

36:20.763 --> 36:23.803
Oh, yeah, thanks, Carl.
It's a rough neighborhood.

36:26.139 --> 36:28.251
Hey, Sue, wait up.

36:31.964 --> 36:34.140
We'll start with whites.
We are

36:34.172 --> 36:37.116
suspending Doug's diet in light
the situation. Thank you.

36:37.148 --> 36:39.292
The plan is to have dirty,
infected sex tonight,

36:39.324 --> 36:41.436
right, my pet?
- There isn't anything

36:41.468 --> 36:45.405
not disgusting about that last
sentence. Please don't call

36:45.437 --> 36:47.741
What's lodged
up your ass, man?

36:47.773 --> 36:51.037
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's that my wife is

36:51.069 --> 36:54.302
with the love of my life.
- Do you get how messed up that

36:54.334 --> 36:57.725
the love of your life in
the same sentence as your wife?

36:57.758 --> 37:00.350
That's not
what I meant, Stace.

37:00.382 --> 37:02.558
Well, what did you mean?

37:02.590 --> 37:04.703
I don't know, Doug!

37:07.326 --> 37:10.687
OK, listen. I know, I know.
You're looking at Robyn,

37:10.719 --> 37:13.055
you're remembering how she would
boss you around in a meeting,

37:13.086 --> 37:16.128
and then you'd be the one
in control when you'd be

37:16.159 --> 37:18.048
of her car, OK?
- Respect.

37:18.079 --> 37:20.543
How is that supposed
to help me?

37:20.575 --> 37:21.952
She's just

37:21.984 --> 37:25.024
the one that got away, Carl.
Everyone has one.

37:25.056 --> 37:29.408
She's your white buffalo.
- Mine was an ex-con.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.225
- What?
- Yeah. Louise.

37:32.256 --> 37:33.953
- Louise.
- She was a mugger.

37:33.985 --> 37:38.466
What I mean by that is she used
to... mug everybody.

37:38.497 --> 37:41.857
It was a real problem.
- And then she... she got away.

37:41.889 --> 37:45.249
Besides, dude, Robyn is so
weird. She's buying her parents

37:45.282 --> 37:48.194
a ski lodge that she used
as a fuck den.

37:48.226 --> 37:51.042
OK, we did a little bit more
than just...

37:51.074 --> 37:53.539
Yeah, it's kinda weird. I didn't
think about that until just now.

37:53.571 --> 37:56.290
Yeah, and I'm gonna
tell you something.

37:56.322 --> 37:59.170
I didn't like you
when you were with Robyn.

37:59.203 --> 38:03.267
Yeah, I said it. You were
suddenly above everything.

38:03.299 --> 38:05.188
'Cause I remember being happy.
- Oh, really?

38:05.219 --> 38:07.779
Well, when you were happy,
everyone hated you, so...

38:07.811 --> 38:12.004
- Dude, you have a great wife.
- Yeah, I know I have a great

38:12.036 --> 38:14.404
who married her.
- So then what the fuck?

38:14.435 --> 38:16.644
So then nothing, OK?
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:16.677 --> 38:18.564
Everything's fine,
everything's great,

38:18.597 --> 38:21.924
except for the fact that
you guys decided to show up.

38:21.957 --> 38:23.748
Kidding. Come on,
bring it in.

38:23.781 --> 38:25.860
I love you.
Shouldn't have come.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.950
So, it's nice that, uh,

38:42.983 --> 38:45.318
you get to spend so much time
with Anatolii.

38:45.351 --> 38:47.942
We haven't seen each other
in months.

38:47.975 --> 38:50.439
I don't know if he stays
in France to avoid me,

38:50.471 --> 38:53.160
or the women he's entered
in Montreal,

38:53.191 --> 38:55.335
many of whom are my peers.

38:55.368 --> 38:58.215
- Excuse me?
- One doesn't prepare

38:58.248 --> 39:00.872
for dinner parties with friends
that have fucked your son.

39:02.857 --> 39:06.664
That's an interesting problem
to encounter.

39:06.697 --> 39:07.657
: Bonjour.

39:17.450 --> 39:23.177
** Toi qui me quitte
avec la levée du jour *

39:23.210 --> 39:27.018
* Et qui me laisse dans I'espoir
d'un retour *

39:27.050 --> 39:30.795
* Pourquoi ne pas faire durer
ce matin *

39:30.826 --> 39:33.419
* Jusqu' demain *

39:33.451 --> 39:36.618
* Je t'offrirai

39:36.651 --> 39:40.459
* Des croissants de soleil
pour déjeuner *

39:40.491 --> 39:44.172
* la saveur de miel
et de rosée *

39:44.203 --> 39:47.980
* Sur un plateau de drap
et d'oreiller *

39:48.012 --> 39:50.669
* Qui fait rver *

39:50.700 --> 39:56.813
* Puis nous dînerons
de paroles de rve *

39:56.844 --> 40:00.557
* Nous goutterons I'amour
et I'eau fraîche *

40:00.589 --> 40:03.725
* Et puis quand viendra
le nouveau matin *

40:03.757 --> 40:06.701
* On sera si bien

40:06.733 --> 40:09.453
* J'inventerai

40:09.486 --> 40:13.518
* Des recettes de bonheur
volonté *

40:13.549 --> 40:17.710
* Sur une musique venue
d'un ciel de mai *

40:17.743 --> 40:21.102
* Que tu ne voudras
plus jamais quitter *

40:21.134 --> 40:24.174
* Sans regretter

40:24.206 --> 40:26.767
* La la la la

40:26.799 --> 40:31.376
* La la la la la la
la la la la *

40:31.407 --> 40:38.704
* La la la la la la
la la la la *

40:38.736 --> 40:40.432
* La la la la *

40:40.463 --> 40:42.160
Oh, my God!

40:42.192 --> 40:46.960
Formidable!
Formi-fuckin'- dable!

40:52.977 --> 40:54.034
That was beautiful, babe.

40:54.065 --> 40:55.824
- Thanks.
- You're so talented.

40:55.857 --> 40:58.705
Thank you. OK.

40:58.737 --> 41:00.114
Come on, let's eat.

41:00.145 --> 41:04.273
Anatolii and I are gonna
smoke a pinner.

41:04.306 --> 41:07.026
- We're in the middle of a meal.
- Yeah, I'm not so hungry.

41:07.058 --> 41:08.114
Ate a lot of cheese.

41:08.146 --> 41:11.315
I'm kind of obsessed with it.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

41:11.347 --> 41:16.083
Could you just leave him alone
for like two seconds?

41:16.116 --> 41:18.228
How much wine
have you had?

41:18.259 --> 41:20.115
- Hardly any.
- Would you let go?

41:20.148 --> 41:21.939
You're pinching me.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.052
What is wrong with you?!

41:41.845 --> 41:42.772
Mine tastes like

41:42.805 --> 41:46.997
Dr. Crapperstein
compared to this.

41:47.030 --> 41:49.782
Where is everybody?

41:50.102 --> 41:52.118
Well, Stacey and Doug went
to pee.

41:52.150 --> 41:54.550
He's a highly hydrated
individual.

41:54.582 --> 41:57.462
And, um, the rest left.

41:57.495 --> 42:00.375
How nice of them.

42:03.319 --> 42:05.814
You wanna walk?

42:05.847 --> 42:08.119
Mm-hmm.

42:08.152 --> 42:11.416
So, I used to have
this fantasy/nightmare

42:11.447 --> 42:14.935
about the guy you end up with.
- Hm.

42:14.968 --> 42:17.239
Yeah. So, you're
in a limo,

42:17.272 --> 42:21.752
and you're, uh, you're
on the way to, um,

42:21.785 --> 42:23.897
the premiere of a game
he designed.

42:23.928 --> 42:27.833
Oh, here we go.

42:27.864 --> 42:30.073
And, uh, and I...

42:30.105 --> 42:32.313
pop into your head,

42:32.345 --> 42:36.217
just like this...
momentary thought.

42:37.946 --> 42:41.018
And then you look
at the guy, the new guy...

42:42.746 --> 42:45.338
...and you think
to yourself, "Wow...

42:46.874 --> 42:51.355
...this guy inspires me
so much more."

42:54.075 --> 42:57.595
And then
you guys just fuck.

42:57.627 --> 42:59.867
Does he have a bigger dick
than you?

42:59.900 --> 43:02.684
- Oh, yeah. Balls too.
- Oh, my God.

43:02.716 --> 43:06.363
You love
to torture yourself.

43:06.395 --> 43:07.772
- Fuck you.
- OK.

43:07.804 --> 43:09.660
Fuck me.

43:11.805 --> 43:16.221
You remember when we did it
in the floor of your office

43:17.949 --> 43:19.677
With the door open.

43:21.756 --> 43:24.701
Do you remember when you used
to whisper in my ear...

43:26.782 --> 43:28.830
That I wanted
to go down on my knees

43:28.861 --> 43:31.487
so the entire staff would know
I was yours?

43:33.918 --> 43:36.638
The world was our canvas,
and we used

43:36.671 --> 43:40.574
every color imaginable
to paint it.

43:42.719 --> 43:45.120
Well, if you ever quit
game design, you could

43:45.151 --> 43:47.583
get into the greeting card
business.

43:50.239 --> 43:53.439
He became obsessed
with the animals he painted.

43:53.472 --> 43:55.904
- These are terrifying.
- Yeah, that's his intention.

43:55.936 --> 43:58.720
Fear of that
which infatuates us.

43:58.752 --> 44:00.928
Apparently
he married this owl.

44:00.960 --> 44:04.225
- What the fuck?
- For tax reasons, I'm assuming.

44:04.257 --> 44:06.145
Yeah!

44:06.177 --> 44:07.808
I just found my new tattoo.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.049
: He has your eyes.

44:31.458 --> 44:33.347
I'd be lying if I said that

44:33.379 --> 44:35.523
I haven't fantasized
about being back here.

44:37.251 --> 44:41.155
Was the helmet part of it?

44:44.516 --> 44:47.492
Can I ask you
something?

44:49.476 --> 44:53.252
Why do you like me
so much?

44:54.981 --> 44:57.093
Like you?

45:05.157 --> 45:06.694
I'm only good

45:06.726 --> 45:08.614
in the beginning,

45:08.646 --> 45:12.262
the exciting part.
I can't do the rest.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.070
I think you're addicted to men
falling in love with you.

45:16.103 --> 45:18.566
Don't reduce me to that
because it didn't work

45:18.598 --> 45:20.774
Work out?

45:20.806 --> 45:24.295
How could it have possibly
worked out? You left!

45:24.327 --> 45:27.367
You never flew to Vancouver
to tell me.

45:27.399 --> 45:29.544
You never fought for me.

45:31.271 --> 45:33.928
But why here?

45:33.959 --> 45:36.744
Why did you buy
this fucking place?

45:38.601 --> 45:41.129
Because there is a part
of me that was hoping

45:41.160 --> 45:43.977
this was more
a than memory too.

45:44.009 --> 45:48.073
I loved you, Carl,
no matter what you think.

46:16.107 --> 46:19.147
That guy's going
really fast.

46:19.179 --> 46:20.172
Hey, slow down!

46:20.203 --> 46:22.827
Slow down!

46:24.939 --> 46:27.148
Oh, fuck, what? Come on!
Are you kidding me?

46:27.181 --> 46:28.812
Oh, my God!

46:34.765 --> 46:36.716
What are you doing here?

46:36.749 --> 46:39.405
Currently I'm
trying to keep warm.

46:39.437 --> 46:42.093
- Wait, you know this guy?
- Who are you?

46:42.125 --> 46:44.141
- He's nobody.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Yeah.

46:44.174 --> 46:47.343
Would you mind telling me what
the hell is going on right now?

46:47.374 --> 46:51.630
Please, I'd love to hear it.
I'm as curious as shit-face

46:51.662 --> 46:54.702
- Carl, this is Aaron...
- OK.

46:54.734 --> 46:57.871
...my, um...
husband.

46:59.887 --> 47:04.367
You're... you're married?
To this guy?

47:04.399 --> 47:07.888
- Separated.
- Yeah, thanks for

47:07.920 --> 47:10.544
- How did you know I was here?
- Your parents told me.

47:10.576 --> 47:12.528
Oh, and want to pass
this message along. They think

47:12.560 --> 47:15.312
you're wonderful and amazing and
have never done anything wrong

47:15.344 --> 47:17.201
This is the guy
from your office?

47:17.233 --> 47:21.329
You're Aaron Berg, aren't you?
I recognize you. You're

47:21.361 --> 47:23.504
Oh, and you must be
Sherlock Holmes, is that right?

47:23.537 --> 47:26.033
I'll take Watson, thank you.
She's got a better body.

47:26.065 --> 47:28.401
OK, Carl, can you
take the skidoo back?

47:28.433 --> 47:30.705
And Aaron and I, we'll walk.
- Yeah, could you get the fuck

47:30.738 --> 47:33.522
out of here, ski patrol?
- Hey, you know what?

47:33.554 --> 47:35.698
You destroyed the skis!
You destroyed my skis, pal!

47:35.730 --> 47:38.802
Yeah, they're fucked!
- I can see that!

47:49.907 --> 47:51.379
What are you doing

47:51.411 --> 47:53.203
in the middle of the woods
with this piece of dog shit?

47:53.235 --> 47:55.347
He's a friend, trust me.
He's married.

47:55.379 --> 48:00.147
You can't do this. You can't fly
here and expect anything.

48:00.179 --> 48:03.059
I just want to talk.
- So talk.

48:03.092 --> 48:07.605
I love you, and I want you to
come home so that we can

48:07.636 --> 48:11.253
It was never my home.
I was always a visitor there.

48:11.285 --> 48:14.037
Don't say that, OK?
I hate when you say that shit!

48:14.069 --> 48:17.460
- Don't get "angy."
- I'm not... I'm not

48:17.493 --> 48:21.046
I'm just saying, you're buying
a fucking ski lodge in Quebec.

48:21.077 --> 48:24.726
A psychotic
episode or something?

48:24.757 --> 48:27.542
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.
- Oh, oh, really?

48:27.574 --> 48:31.350
Ejaculating all over my desk?
I'd call that pretty bad.

48:31.382 --> 48:34.391
That seemed like the right
thing to do at the time.

48:34.422 --> 48:35.959
Oscar misses you.

48:35.991 --> 48:38.039
- Right.
- He does. It's like a wake

48:38.071 --> 48:40.983
at our house. We can't
watch any of our shows.

48:41.015 --> 48:44.631
I have all
the Rookie Blu PVR'd.

48:44.664 --> 48:45.464
Watch 'em.

48:45.495 --> 48:48.568
I'm caught up.
Crazy stuff happens.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.480
- What?
- Hey, I can't get

48:51.512 --> 48:54.520
this fucking thing started.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

48:54.552 --> 48:57.625
I'm really sorry.
- Why the fuck

48:57.656 --> 49:01.113
are you still here, huh?!
- Hey, you know what, pal?

49:01.144 --> 49:03.993
I think she's making
her feelings pretty clear, OK?

49:04.025 --> 49:07.898
Oh, is that right?
Excuse me, just one second.

49:07.929 --> 49:11.066
- Fake head butt?
- Stop!

49:11.097 --> 49:13.850
What are you gonna do,
motherfucking bitch?

49:13.882 --> 49:17.082
- Mr. Slap My Face?
- OK, OK, OK, Carl,

49:17.115 --> 49:20.187
Yeah, go.

49:22.618 --> 49:24.763
Oh, that's right,
I can't get it started.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.354
Love to get out of here. I'd
love to get out of your hair.

49:27.387 --> 49:31.099
I'd love it.

49:31.131 --> 49:33.787
Get it started.
A little turn of the key.

49:33.820 --> 49:35.836
It's really nice to meet you,
man. That was sarcasm.

49:35.867 --> 49:38.620
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Ride this back to the lodge,

49:38.652 --> 49:40.316
you fuckin'...

49:57.405 --> 50:00.510
I can't believe she's married
to Aaron Berg.

50:02.238 --> 50:05.086
You should have seen the guy;
he was a fuckin' maniac.

50:20.864 --> 50:24.992
Hey, I'm really sorry
about this, about all this -

50:25.023 --> 50:27.008
Stacey, and everything...

50:27.039 --> 50:29.121
I'm sorry I was...

50:29.152 --> 50:32.256
jealous of Anatolii.
He seems like a perfectly

50:32.289 --> 50:36.000
nice, very handsome young man.

50:46.145 --> 50:47.777
Babe.

50:50.977 --> 50:55.043
There's something I want
to tell you about Robyn and I.

50:57.955 --> 51:00.067
What?

51:00.899 --> 51:03.779
Our relationship was
a little more intense

51:03.811 --> 51:06.627
than I originally led on.

51:06.660 --> 51:09.540
We actually dated
for like a year.

51:13.987 --> 51:15.620
Hm.

51:18.788 --> 51:20.644
Yeah, but it was...

51:20.676 --> 51:23.973
everything that's wrong
in a relationship.

51:24.004 --> 51:27.172
It was toxic, passionate...

51:27.205 --> 51:29.606
- Sounds awful.
- The whole thing

51:29.637 --> 51:31.781
consisted of just fighting
and fucking...

51:31.813 --> 51:34.598
- Stop!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51:37.797 --> 51:40.774
I just thought I owed you

51:40.805 --> 51:42.438
the truth.

51:44.998 --> 51:47.110
Are you OK?

51:48.935 --> 51:51.047
I think so.

51:56.967 --> 52:00.647
It's so odd that you've
never mentioned this person.

52:00.679 --> 52:04.200
I love you
so much.

52:04.232 --> 52:07.752
I want to be buried
next to you.

52:07.783 --> 52:12.424
And you can wear your... your
disgusting sweater for eternity.

52:16.713 --> 52:18.985
I've got a surprise
for you.

52:19.016 --> 52:22.473
I have something for you.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

52:24.714 --> 52:27.753
If you guys went out
for a year...

52:27.786 --> 52:29.450
Yeah.

52:31.722 --> 52:36.043
Well... it's kind of amazing
that she happened

52:36.074 --> 52:38.059
to buy the lodge
that you brought me to.

52:38.090 --> 52:42.442
- No, no, I had no idea...
- It's just a big coincidence.

52:42.475 --> 52:45.548
Depends on how
you look at it.

52:48.395 --> 52:51.563
Have you been here with her?

52:51.596 --> 52:54.220
I thought you would think
it was weird, so I didn't...

52:54.252 --> 52:57.036
- You have?
- Now, hold on, I haven't...

52:57.069 --> 53:01.293
It is weird, Carl.
It's extremely fucking weird.

53:01.324 --> 53:02.957
Clearly you knew that
or you wouldn't have

53:02.988 --> 53:04.396
kept it a secret.
- Yeah, I did keep it

53:04.428 --> 53:06.316
a secret because I knew that
you would think it was weird.

53:06.348 --> 53:09.997
I just said that.
Oh, OK, uh, Greece is romantic.

53:10.029 --> 53:12.685
If I'd taken her to Greece,
does that mean we could

53:12.718 --> 53:14.605
Probably not;
that's just how it works.

53:14.638 --> 53:17.869
And this isn't a fucking
country, Carl; it's a ski lodge.

53:17.902 --> 53:19.597
How many times
have you been up here?

53:19.630 --> 53:22.991
- Does that matter?
- More than once?

53:23.022 --> 53:25.871
- I don't know, a few times.
- Did you stay

53:25.903 --> 53:28.398
in this room? Did you stay
in the fucking Lovers' Suite?

53:28.430 --> 53:32.496
It's a small inn. We probably
stayed in all the rooms.

53:32.527 --> 53:34.895
You probably fought and fucked
all over this place.

53:34.927 --> 53:36.943
I feel sick to my stomach.
I feel sick.

53:36.975 --> 53:39.408
No, listen, I picked
this place because I knew

53:39.440 --> 53:41.360
it was nice, and I thought
you would like it.

53:41.391 --> 53:44.559
That's it, that's the whole...
Where are you going?

53:44.592 --> 53:46.864
It's freezing outside!

53:51.985 --> 53:53.329
Hey.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.280
What are you doing?

53:55.312 --> 53:57.489
I'm not allowed to bring
my iPad, but you can fucking...

53:57.521 --> 53:59.570
I'm so fucking sick
of your rules, Carl.

53:59.601 --> 54:01.713
What are you doing?

54:05.202 --> 54:07.314
It's her, isn't it?

54:13.490 --> 54:15.891
It looks like you.
I designed her to look like you.

54:15.923 --> 54:18.514
I don't have a fucking
rose tattoo on my forearm.

54:20.051 --> 54:22.611
You're obsessed with her.
- No, I'm not obsessed with her.

54:22.643 --> 54:25.332
What happened on that
ski trail? What happened?

54:25.363 --> 54:27.252
You were completely flushed
when you came in.

54:27.283 --> 54:28.979
Yeah, he slapped me
in the face!

54:29.011 --> 54:32.596
Well, why the fuck would he
slap you if you hadn't

54:40.532 --> 54:43.765
The clothes you get me to wear.
The heels. You've been trying

54:43.796 --> 54:45.685
to mold me into
your ex-girlfriend for years!

54:45.717 --> 54:48.020
- That's insane!
- No shit! I have changed

54:48.053 --> 54:50.294
so much for you.
- I've changed everything!

54:50.325 --> 54:52.021
I've changed tons of things
for you.

54:52.053 --> 54:55.413
- I quit drinking for you.
- No, you quit drinking for you.

54:55.446 --> 54:57.462
You were drunk every
fucking night! You were dr...

54:57.494 --> 54:59.863
I was a kid! Sorry I wasn't
inspiring the world

54:59.894 --> 55:02.935
with a fucking ski lodge!
- I don't want that.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.206
You don't know
what the fuck you want.

55:05.239 --> 55:07.063
I just want you.
Please, please.

55:07.094 --> 55:10.327
- Give me the keys.
- Please, please! I'm not gonna

55:10.358 --> 55:12.471
- Give me your keys, Carl!
- Please...

55:14.839 --> 55:16.376
Stop it!

55:16.407 --> 55:19.575
Sue, where are you gonna go?
Where are you gonna go?

55:19.607 --> 55:22.487
Door... slam!

55:25.400 --> 55:27.000
Oh, my God!

55:28.728 --> 55:30.840
Sue, Sue, are you OK?

55:37.369 --> 55:39.258
Honey.

55:51.066 --> 55:54.779
You know, it's pretty
incredible that you've held

55:54.811 --> 55:57.019
Look, hey, maybe
there's something to be said

55:57.050 --> 56:00.539
about that, you know?
On the other hand,

56:00.571 --> 56:02.651
you could have, like,
an obsessive disorder,

56:02.683 --> 56:07.867
in which case we should...
we should talk to a physician.

56:07.899 --> 56:08.827
You want me to be quiet?

56:08.859 --> 56:10.843
Yeah.

56:10.876 --> 56:13.180
OK.

56:17.661 --> 56:21.308
- Sue, are you all right, baby?
- Get the fuck out of here,

56:21.340 --> 56:24.413
Get the fuck away from me.
Get out!

56:26.908 --> 56:29.246
I want to take
her to the hospital.

56:29.278 --> 56:32.477
50km away, so I would
advise against it.

56:32.510 --> 56:34.781
Oh, oh, you would?
You'd advise against it?

56:34.814 --> 56:36.862
He'd advise against it.
- How is she?

56:36.894 --> 56:39.581
Well, we think
she's had a concussion.

56:39.614 --> 56:41.950
Shit. Well,
how do you know?

56:41.982 --> 56:44.991
He's some kind of life coach.

56:45.022 --> 56:48.575
- You're a life coach?
- I'm a trained lifeguard.

56:48.607 --> 56:49.791
Like in real life?

56:49.823 --> 56:52.767
This isn't some erotica film?
- Hey, man, I passed bronze med.

56:52.799 --> 56:55.391
- Oh, that's no joke.
- Well, she asked that you don't

56:55.423 --> 56:58.303
sleep in her room tonight,
asshole - her words.

56:58.336 --> 57:01.440
She'll see you
tomorrow, asshole.

57:01.471 --> 57:04.832
Is that second "asshole"
from you, or her?

57:04.865 --> 57:07.904
Listen, you gotta wake her up
intermittently throughout the

57:07.937 --> 57:09.824
you slap her in the face,
you punch her in the teeth.

57:09.857 --> 57:10.880
- Seriously, man?
- She has a concussion.

57:10.913 --> 57:13.184
So you punch my wife
in the teeth?

57:17.217 --> 57:19.713
Basically he's saying his mom
is gonna sleep with Sue,

57:19.745 --> 57:23.010
and it hasn't happened yet,
but that is going to happen,

57:23.042 --> 57:25.410
and that... I'm getting
that Anatolii...

57:25.442 --> 57:28.162
I'm just getting that Anatolii
is not happy about that.

57:34.210 --> 57:36.323
Trouble in paradise?

57:38.723 --> 57:41.123
Look, Carl, I'm...

57:41.156 --> 57:43.427
sorry about your skis.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.924
And also for slapping you
in the face.

57:49.316 --> 57:51.204
The skis were
a limited edition.

57:51.236 --> 57:53.411
Find them on the internet.
- Probably not.

57:53.444 --> 57:55.557
It'll be challenging.

57:57.892 --> 57:59.685
- Have a beer with me.
- Honestly, I just

57:59.717 --> 58:03.269
want to get some sleep.
- I will have a beer.

58:03.301 --> 58:05.509
Me too.
My day buzz is wearing off.

58:05.541 --> 58:08.038
Oh-ho-ho, quick, inject
the female with some alcohol

58:08.070 --> 58:11.429
before she turns into
a fucking monster.

58:11.461 --> 58:15.878
There you go, you got
some drinking buddies.

58:17.413 --> 58:19.718
Well, I wouldn't want
to make you "angy."

58:25.479 --> 58:27.719
What's your,
uh, tattoo?

58:27.751 --> 58:29.447
That is a panther,

58:29.479 --> 58:33.032
those are lightning bolts
shooting out of its eyes;

58:33.063 --> 58:36.583
therefore
it's a lightning panther.

58:36.615 --> 58:37.735
- I love it.
- It's impossible

58:37.768 --> 58:39.655
not to.

58:39.688 --> 58:42.152
So,

58:42.184 --> 58:44.360
you're the Carl
that went out with my wife.

58:44.392 --> 58:49.096
Hm. And you're the husband
we never knew existed.

58:49.129 --> 58:51.433
She didn't mention me?

58:52.585 --> 58:56.201
- I probably wasn't listening.
- Yeah, I tend to tune her out

58:56.234 --> 58:58.025
myself.
- Mm-hmm.

58:58.058 --> 58:59.753
- Well, most do.
- You know,

58:59.785 --> 59:03.914
frankly, I just... expected
someone a little...

59:03.946 --> 59:06.314
Yeah, well,
the feeling's mutual.

59:06.346 --> 59:08.490
I guess we know
she has a type.

59:08.523 --> 59:10.986
- I'm too hot for her.
- You know, it's crazy.

59:11.019 --> 59:15.307
You're the guy whose career
I wish I had.

59:15.339 --> 59:16.555
Yeah, well, I had a kid
really young,

59:16.587 --> 59:18.539
so it made me grow up fast.
- Oh, how old is

59:18.571 --> 59:21.323
your little twerp?
- He's not a twerp anymore.

59:21.355 --> 59:22.603
He's got pubic hair.

59:24.556 --> 59:26.443
Oscar is 13, so...

59:26.476 --> 59:28.171
- Ah, 13.
- Yeah.

59:28.204 --> 59:32.395
- Were you 13 when you had him?
- Ha, ha. No.

59:32.428 --> 59:34.477
Holly and I were seniors
in high school.

59:34.508 --> 59:36.685
Holly's my first wife.

59:36.716 --> 59:39.629
Wow. Well, maybe
third time will be the charm.

59:39.661 --> 59:40.973
Stacey.

59:41.004 --> 59:44.077
No, um, this is
gonna work out.

59:44.109 --> 59:46.446
I mean, it...
it has to.

59:46.477 --> 59:50.894
Robyn is, uh...
everything to me, so...

59:50.926 --> 59:55.406
Honestly, I respect that.
I do. I mean, you chased

59:55.437 --> 59:57.679
- Yeah.
- And it didn't work out.

59:57.710 --> 01:00:00.302
I mean, sometimes I wish
I had done the same.

01:00:02.638 --> 01:00:05.487
What do...
what do you mean by that?

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.726
Oh, come on, Doug.
When I was a little girl,

01:00:07.759 --> 01:00:11.247
I didn't exactly dream of being
with a man with a supernatural

01:00:11.279 --> 01:00:13.808
and a yeast infection.
- Serious?

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.623
It's very serious.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:19.984
To you and not settling.

01:00:34.002 --> 01:00:37.009
- My body, my rules!
- Oh! I'm sorry.

01:00:48.018 --> 01:00:50.419
Sue?

01:00:55.507 --> 01:00:56.851
Oh, um...

01:00:56.882 --> 01:00:59.028
Oh, my God.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.852
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:00.884 --> 01:01:02.355
I'm sorry, I...

01:01:02.388 --> 01:01:04.500
This room is not part
of the B&B experience.

01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:07.028
I am still renovating.
- I'm sorry, I'm gone.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.108
I'm so sorry.
- No, wait, wait. It's fine,

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.525
it's fine. This pigeon pose -
everything just comes

01:01:13.557 --> 01:01:15.669
gushing out, you know?

01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:20.501
I'm so mortified.

01:01:20.533 --> 01:01:23.381
There. Better?

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.910
Yeah.

01:01:25.942 --> 01:01:28.662
Nice tights. Heh. Not.

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:34.325
Remember when Borat brought
the "not" back?

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:37.206
Comedy works in cycles.

01:01:37.238 --> 01:01:38.806
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:40.727
No, that's very funny.

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:45.016
You knew you were emailing
with me,

01:01:45.047 --> 01:01:46.327
right? I haven't changed
my work email

01:01:46.359 --> 01:01:48.184
in 10 years.

01:01:51.448 --> 01:01:53.335
A little strange

01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:55.736
you didn't mention it.

01:01:55.768 --> 01:01:58.808
A little strange
you brought your wife here.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.281
It's a mistake to over-
intellectualize paintings.

01:02:08.313 --> 01:02:11.130
Picasso said it's
like the sound of birds -

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:14.137
it fills you with emotion,
yet you can't make sense of it.

01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:17.593
- Mm, that's cool.
- Mm.

01:02:17.626 --> 01:02:19.674
: Morning.

01:02:24.314 --> 01:02:26.010
What about you, Sue?

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.795
Did you get much rest
with my mother molesting you?

01:02:55.836 --> 01:02:58.493
Hey.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:01.854
- Am I interrupting something?
- Yes.

01:03:01.885 --> 01:03:03.997
Tough. Shared table.

01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:08.221
Are you OK?
Is your head all right?

01:03:08.254 --> 01:03:11.134
It's never been
more clear.

01:03:15.806 --> 01:03:18.782
Do you ever take those
heels off? It's 9am.

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:22.495
My nana sent them from Italy.
Good morning, everyone.

01:03:22.526 --> 01:03:24.767
'Tis a beautiful one.
- 'Tis, Ryan,

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:29.055
'tis. You know
what I think it is?

01:03:29.088 --> 01:03:31.167
It's all this history.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.928
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.136
- Hey.
- I got morning hugs.

01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:36.992
Come on.
- No.

01:03:37.024 --> 01:03:40.672
- Don't touch me.
- Whoa, you can't catch

01:03:40.705 --> 01:03:42.913
Ooh, ahh!
What's on the grill?

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:46.946
- Oh, fuck.
- Aaron, uh,

01:03:46.977 --> 01:03:50.337
- You're pretty.
- And this is Lise and Anatolii.

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:53.282
- Mmm.
- As you may have gathered, I do

01:03:53.313 --> 01:03:56.162
that is, when she
makes it home for dinner.

01:03:56.193 --> 01:03:58.978
If you look up "mortified"
in the dictionary, you'll

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:02.307
That's cute. The only place
she can bear to lose control

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.602
what I'm talking about, right?
- Are you kidding me?

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:08.483
Can you help me
in the kitchen?

01:04:08.514 --> 01:04:10.818
Jeez. My turn on the chore wheel
again, I guess.

01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:14.403
Do you know what it's like
to have walked through your

01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:16.996
look of disappointment on their
faces that I'm not Holly?

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:19.204
Who gives a shit what they
think? They're fucking senile!

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:21.540
Who cares if Oscar doesn't
like you? This is about us.

01:04:21.572 --> 01:04:23.620
- He said that?
- No.

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:25.541
He's a teenager -
he hates everything.

01:04:25.572 --> 01:04:28.421
Don't take is personally.
- I'm a horrible stepmother.

01:04:28.452 --> 01:04:31.333
- No, you're not.
- Just come home.

01:04:31.364 --> 01:04:34.117
Look, I know
that this has been hard, pickle.

01:04:34.149 --> 01:04:37.157
How did you get out of your jar
and all the way here?

01:04:38.886 --> 01:04:41.381
I took a pickle plane.

01:04:41.413 --> 01:04:44.614
The seating was cramped.

01:04:44.646 --> 01:04:46.598
Hot beans?

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:49.447
- Coffee?
- I will take half a cup.

01:04:49.478 --> 01:04:51.878
Great. No problem.
Anybody else?

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:55.303
- Thank you.
- Do you want

01:05:01.702 --> 01:05:03.815
- What's sailor?
- Shh.

01:05:23.017 --> 01:05:25.321
They went
snowshoeing.

01:05:25.353 --> 01:05:28.425
Who's "they?"

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.953
Your wife and the cougar.

01:05:35.273 --> 01:05:36.970
I feel you, man.

01:05:37.002 --> 01:05:39.402
I have a flight to Paris
in six hours.

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:41.387
I've done an amazing thing
coming here.

01:05:41.418 --> 01:05:44.075
Yeah, yeah,

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.275
you're such a great son,
you see your mom twice a year

01:05:47.306 --> 01:05:49.418
Well, she's the one
getting action now.

01:06:14.413 --> 01:06:15.373
Sue?

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.766
Sue?

01:06:39.215 --> 01:06:41.391
What's going on?

01:06:41.423 --> 01:06:42.672
We were snowshoeing.

01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:46.639
No, you weren't.
The snowshoes are behind you,

01:06:46.672 --> 01:06:49.328
stuck in the fucking snow.
- I'll wait by the trail.

01:06:50.863 --> 01:06:53.393
There's no need to wait.
You can just leave.

01:06:53.424 --> 01:06:55.536
You don't deserve her.

01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:07.665
We shared a moment.

01:07:07.698 --> 01:07:09.906
You know what that's like.

01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:14.386
So, now you're...
cheating on me

01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:17.618
with a woman
that you just met.

01:07:22.354 --> 01:07:25.939
Don't you think that you're
overreacting a little bit?

01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:30.803
Uh... I look at it as
making up for lost

01:07:30.836 --> 01:07:34.547
What the fuck
does that mean?

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.228
When you get sad, is it
because you're thinking of her?

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.196
No.

01:07:42.228 --> 01:07:43.636
You know, for months
you've been

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:46.868
implying that this weekend was
gonna be some big answer

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.557
and I think I was in denial
about what needed fixing.

01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:53.909
- We don't need fixing.
- Stop lying for two seconds!

01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.398
I haven't been attracted
to you for two years.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.278
So, that's my thing.

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:06.422
You gross me out.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.263
I do?

01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:20.919
I'm glad
this weekend happened.

01:08:20.952 --> 01:08:24.759
I think it had to happen.
So you can go fuck yourself,

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:26.488
sailor.

01:08:49.946 --> 01:08:52.314
Ah.

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:53.721
Hey, Sherlock.

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:57.082
I see you've solved the mystery
of starting the skidoo.

01:08:57.113 --> 01:09:00.154
- I did.
- I'm sorry I called you sailor.

01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:02.523
No, it's all right.

01:09:02.554 --> 01:09:04.666
It wasn't your fault.

01:09:07.675 --> 01:09:09.564
Want to get on?

01:09:09.595 --> 01:09:12.028
I was looking forward
to the arm workout.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.348
Get on the skidoo, Robyn.

01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:00.351
Mmm.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.696
Right here.
This is good.

01:10:05.728 --> 01:10:08.992
- Oh... wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, I'm falling.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.152
- OK, right here.
- What are...

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:17.025
- Oh. Oh, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:10:17.057 --> 01:10:19.200
Can you... are you, uh...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:19.233 --> 01:10:21.921
- Do you want my... I can...
- They make it really hard to

01:10:21.953 --> 01:10:23.521
OK, I'm not on the pill,
so pull out, OK?

01:10:23.554 --> 01:10:25.410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:10:31.714 --> 01:10:33.410
Holy shit.

01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:35.650
Fuck.

01:10:35.682 --> 01:10:38.083
Oh, yeah.

01:10:38.114 --> 01:10:39.650
Oh!

01:10:39.682 --> 01:10:42.530
Oh! Oh!

01:10:42.563 --> 01:10:45.155
Yeah. Ah!

01:10:48.323 --> 01:10:50.211
- Ah.
- Yeah.

01:10:50.243 --> 01:10:51.939
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Oh.

01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:54.692
I'm sorry. Let me just...
I can go... here.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.468
Did you... did you?
- No.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.836
No, you go ahead.
Are you close?

01:11:02.564 --> 01:11:05.125
Not really, no.

01:11:05.157 --> 01:11:08.164
Um... uh...

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.533
OK.

01:11:10.565 --> 01:11:12.901
Just, uh...
can you

01:11:12.933 --> 01:11:16.294
tell me how you were waiting
for me on the trail

01:11:16.326 --> 01:11:18.053
like a little slu...

01:11:18.086 --> 01:11:20.997
like, uh,
in your snowsuit?

01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:25.254
Uh, yeah. Um...

01:11:25.287 --> 01:11:27.654
I was getting, uh,
maple syrup

01:11:27.686 --> 01:11:30.183
at the tree,
and, uh...

01:11:30.215 --> 01:11:33.063
and I was waiting for the sap...
- Yeah.

01:11:33.095 --> 01:11:36.135
...'cause it takes a while.
- Yeah, sap will take

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:39.496
And, um...

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.896
Shit.
- Robyn, are you crying?

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.975
Oh, my God.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.959
Oh, shit, no.

01:12:04.169 --> 01:12:06.729
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

01:12:06.762 --> 01:12:09.482
I think so. You?

01:12:13.482 --> 01:12:15.370
We should get going.

01:12:15.402 --> 01:12:16.939
You go ahead.

01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:19.210
No, I'm not gonna leave
without you.

01:12:19.243 --> 01:12:21.548
No, please go.

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:55.021
She's gone - with the hottie
and his hot mother.

01:12:55.053 --> 01:12:57.166
See you in the city.

01:13:09.007 --> 01:13:10.895
Well, I'm on the 8 o'clock
home tonight.

01:13:10.927 --> 01:13:13.295
Yeah, I think she might have
completely lost her mind.

01:13:13.327 --> 01:13:16.272
Yeah. Can I call you back?

01:13:20.144 --> 01:13:26.992
* I'll follow

01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:42.770
* I'm yours, so...

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:58.771
Oh, of course
that's what's happening.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.388
Hey.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.308
Sue.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.260
Go home, Carl.

01:15:03.897 --> 01:15:05.560
What the hell
are you doing here, Carl?

01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:08.793
You broke into my house?
Are you kidding me?!

01:15:08.825 --> 01:15:11.577
Now Anatolii's joined
the party.

01:15:14.073 --> 01:15:16.921
All right, all right, buddy,
just... just cool your jets, OK?

01:15:16.953 --> 01:15:19.194
- Please, guys...
- OK, all right, I'm...

01:15:19.225 --> 01:15:21.337
He knows Krav Maga.

01:15:23.514 --> 01:15:26.042
- Hey!
- Oh! Fuck! Stop it!

01:15:26.074 --> 01:15:29.018
Stop it! Stop. Enough.

01:15:34.074 --> 01:15:37.563
We need to speak.
- Your husband's a pussy.

01:15:37.595 --> 01:15:39.483
What are you even doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be

01:15:39.515 --> 01:15:43.067
on some movie set in Paris
getting your... getting

01:16:20.446 --> 01:16:23.294
And then they get
the fuck out of this house.

01:16:23.326 --> 01:16:25.342
Copy that.

01:16:32.639 --> 01:16:35.936
Sorry to interrupt
your dance party.

01:16:42.304 --> 01:16:43.424
I think the best

01:16:43.456 --> 01:16:47.105
discovery I made this weekend
was how much I miss wine.

01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:52.705
I love you so much.

01:16:54.817 --> 01:16:56.737
Not enough.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:01.281
We don't
love each other enough.

01:17:03.714 --> 01:17:05.665
I disagree.

01:17:09.026 --> 01:17:11.138
How do you know?

01:17:16.995 --> 01:17:19.107
I slept with her.

01:17:30.532 --> 01:17:33.765
I was... confused.

01:17:33.796 --> 01:17:36.388
You said
that it was over.

01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:52.998
I was gonna give you this
over the weekend.

01:17:54.726 --> 01:17:56.838
I finally got
our wedding rings.

01:18:04.999 --> 01:18:06.631
Sue.

01:18:08.615 --> 01:18:10.407
Wait.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.336
How could you look
into my father's eyes

01:18:15.368 --> 01:18:18.567
and ask to marry me if you had
all this shit in your heart?

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.416
How could you make me
walk down the aisle?

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.712
How can you do that
to somebody?

01:18:24.745 --> 01:18:26.632
What was I supposed to do?
Just bow out of life

01:18:26.665 --> 01:18:29.192
because I have
a little baggage?

01:18:30.889 --> 01:18:34.442
Everyone's got exes, Sue;
everyone's got little pieces

01:18:34.473 --> 01:18:37.545
of their heart that belong
to other people.

01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:41.994
It just becomes a part
of who you are.

01:18:47.562 --> 01:18:49.674
But you let it ruin us.

01:19:26.605 --> 01:19:28.653
** What is this

01:19:30.414 --> 01:19:34.735
* Got me feelin' so good
right now *

01:19:34.766 --> 01:19:38.415
* What is this

01:19:38.446 --> 01:19:42.255
* Make me wanna run home
anyhow *

01:19:42.287 --> 01:19:46.256
* Whatever it is, yeah

01:19:46.287 --> 01:19:50.447
* Oh, I cannot, cannot hold

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.367
* My peace

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.559
* Mmm *

01:20:10.162 --> 01:20:12.689
- Hi.
- Mmm.

01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:15.058
All dressed up
for the opera?

01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:24.978
How's it been going...
generally?

01:20:29.363 --> 01:20:32.082
Be sure
you chew that, now.

01:20:35.283 --> 01:20:37.940
Is there anything in there
he can cut himself with?

01:21:11.414 --> 01:21:14.423
Later, dick nipples.

01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:16.854
That's nipples on dicks.

01:21:16.887 --> 01:21:21.175
That makes absolutely
no sense.

01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:22.039
I'll call you later.

01:21:22.072 --> 01:21:25.144
OK. I'll be sure
to screen the call.

01:21:52.409 --> 01:21:54.105
It's Sue, right? Hmm?

01:21:54.138 --> 01:21:56.409
It's good to see you back

01:21:56.442 --> 01:21:58.489
on stage, Carlos Santana.

01:22:00.026 --> 01:22:02.810
You're in town
for the Mexican parade?

01:22:05.307 --> 01:22:08.251
Is there a...
Mexican parade in town?

01:22:08.283 --> 01:22:10.171
- I don't know.
- No?

01:22:10.203 --> 01:22:12.123
You look amazing.
- Oh.

01:22:12.155 --> 01:22:15.003
I agree.
I do look fantastic.

01:22:18.107 --> 01:22:20.507
So, I've had some time
to do some thinking.

01:22:20.539 --> 01:22:22.108
Uh, yeah, I've been doing

01:22:22.139 --> 01:22:25.788
a lot of thinking. Um...
- Before you say anything,

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:30.140
I just want to...
put something out there.

01:22:30.172 --> 01:22:32.285
I'm seeing somebody.

01:22:37.981 --> 01:22:40.253
That...
Oh, that's cool.

01:22:42.173 --> 01:22:43.837
Who is he?

01:22:45.566 --> 01:22:47.678
He's just a guy.

01:22:49.822 --> 01:22:52.958
We shouldn't have done this.
- No, we had to do it.

01:22:54.878 --> 01:22:56.414
We had to.

01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:01.503
If it didn't hurt, something
would be wrong with me.

01:23:01.535 --> 01:23:03.647
There's a lot
wrong with you.

01:23:07.968 --> 01:23:09.920
The fact is, I...

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.000
I lost...

01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:16.160
someone that I could have spent
the rest of my life with.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.656
It wouldn't have been
right, though.

01:23:20.385 --> 01:23:22.912
I acted more like a sister
than a wife.

01:23:22.945 --> 01:23:24.769
You were perfect.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.521
No. No, no. No.

01:23:27.553 --> 01:23:31.233
I knew that it was over
long before that weekend.

01:23:31.265 --> 01:23:34.530
And I was just too scared
to do anything about it.

01:23:46.275 --> 01:23:48.163
I miss you.

01:23:51.076 --> 01:23:54.979
Just promise me you won't make
your next girlfriend wear

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:01.027
I don't...

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.428
think I can do that.

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:09.125
- Mmm.
- You're doing great, baby.

01:24:11.748 --> 01:24:14.341
You gross me out.

01:24:14.373 --> 01:24:17.798
Fuck you.

01:24:17.829 --> 01:24:20.037
** I don't want nobody
to leave me *

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.790
* I don't need nobody
to want me *

01:24:22.821 --> 01:24:26.886
* I know this may sound strange
right from the start *

01:24:26.918 --> 01:24:29.575
* 'Cause when I wanted somebody
to need me *

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:32.230
* When I needed somebody
to want me *

01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:36.199
* All I ever got was
a broken heart *

01:24:36.231 --> 01:24:38.888
* I felt no taller
than the ground *

01:24:38.919 --> 01:24:41.383
* True love had
let me down *

01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:45.128
* But I had to be a man
and stand up tall *

01:24:45.159 --> 01:24:47.848
* And this heart of mine
was pure *

01:24:47.879 --> 01:24:49.928
* But I know
now for sure *

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.848
* That love,
you didn't love me *

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.728
* You didn't need me,
you didn't want me *

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.649
* Don't want nobody
to change me *

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.400
* Or try
to rearrange me *

01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:03.369
* Just take away the pain
that's tearing up my mind *

01:25:03.401 --> 01:25:06.249
* 'Cause love has been
my total destruction *

01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:08.170
* Like a volcano
eruption *

01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:12.010
* To me, love and pain
just seem to rhyme *

01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:15.178
* I felt no taller
than the ground *

01:25:15.209 --> 01:25:17.642
* True love had
let me down *

01:25:17.674 --> 01:25:21.611
* I had to be a man
and stand up tall *

01:25:21.642 --> 01:25:24.139
* This heart of mine
was pure *

01:25:24.171 --> 01:25:26.282
* But I know
now for sure *

01:25:26.315 --> 01:25:28.331
* That love,
you didn't love me *

01:25:28.363 --> 01:25:30.987
* You didn't need me,
you didn't want me *

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.132
* I don't want nobody
to change me *

01:25:33.163 --> 01:25:35.371
* Or try
to rearrange me *

01:25:35.403 --> 01:25:39.564
* Take away the pain
that's tearing up my mind *

01:25:39.596 --> 01:25:42.123
* Love has been
my total destruction *

01:25:42.156 --> 01:25:44.012
* Like a volcano
eruption *

01:25:44.043 --> 01:25:48.364
* To me, love and pain
just seem to rhyme *

01:25:48.397 --> 01:25:52.845
* Love don't love me

01:25:52.877 --> 01:25:57.485
* No, no, no, no

01:25:57.517 --> 01:26:01.454
* Love don't love me

01:26:01.486 --> 01:26:05.550
* Love, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no... **
