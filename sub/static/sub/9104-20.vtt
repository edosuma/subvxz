00:46.960 --> 00:49.400
&lrm;So, what do you think of my new album?

00:49.560 --> 00:51.400
&lrm;Can you feel it, Bob? Isn't it killer?

00:51.560 --> 00:53.120
&lrm;Not bad, Jagged, not bad,

00:53.280 --> 00:55.920
&lrm;but if you really want
&lrm;to make something killer,

00:56.080 --> 00:58.520
&lrm;let's talk about this duet with Mr XY.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.320
&lrm;No way, he's not a rocker.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.840
&lrm;He's a baby. I bet he doesn't even shave.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.160
&lrm;This "baby" just pushed you
&lrm;off the No 1 spot.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.200
&lrm;And? Doesn't make him
&lrm;a true musician like me.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.400
&lrm;Penny thinks everything I do is killer.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.000
&lrm;Penny's your agent but I'm your real boss.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.120
<i>&lrm;Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records</i>
<i>&lrm;cannot afford to be No 2</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:21.200
&lrm;or rep a No 2 rock star.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.040
&lrm;Get real.
&lrm;You have to modernise your music,

01:24.200 --> 01:26.280
&lrm;change your look, get a new style.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.760
&lrm;You wanna talk real?
&lrm;I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, Bob,

01:29.920 --> 01:31.760
<i>&lrm;not some popstar in diapers.</i>

01:31.880 --> 01:35.400
<i>&lrm;I'm an artist with real talent.</i>
<i>&lrm;Even my hair's real.</i>

01:35.560 --> 01:39.400
&lrm;That's what people love about me.
&lrm;Isn't that right, Fang? Yeah.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.160
&lrm;The artwork you did for my album
&lrm;is a waste of my time.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.960
&lrm;Seriously, Bob? What is this trash?
&lrm;It looks like a perfume ad.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.200
&lrm;That's what people want these days.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.560
&lrm;Well I don't.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.520
&lrm;My album covers exude the smell
&lrm;of sweat and leather.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.600
&lrm;If your next album doesn't rank
&lrm;No 1 in the charts,

01:58.760 --> 02:01.560
&lrm;it'll be your last
&lrm;with Bob Roth Records!

02:01.720 --> 02:04.800
&lrm;I'd rather do nothing
&lrm;than sing a pathetic duet with

02:04.960 --> 02:06.320
&lrm;a baby-faced nobody.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.240
&lrm;Jagged and I had an idea.
&lrm;Its concept is modern

02:09.400 --> 02:12.680
&lrm;but it also respects
&lrm;Jagged's own "rugged" style.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.440
&lrm;The girl who made
&lrm;these glasses has real talent.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.760
&lrm;She gets my style.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.400
&lrm;She'll design the cover of my new album.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.720
&lrm;A schoolgirl?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.400
&lrm;See? That's just it.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.120
&lrm;She's the same age
&lrm;as the target audience.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.640
&lrm;Here's her address.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.880

02:28.040 --> 02:29.240
&lrm;[snarling]

02:29.400 --> 02:32.480
&lrm;OK. But think about that duet
&lrm;with Mr XY.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.920
&lrm;Find that girl, Bob!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.400
&lrm;[Bob] <i>&lrm;So, are you interested?</i>

02:36.560 --> 02:37.680
&lrm;[Marinette] <i>&lrm;Wait,</i>

02:37.840 --> 02:39.200
&lrm;let me get this straight.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.840
&lrm;You want me to design
&lrm;the album cover for Jagged Stone?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.320
&lrm;My... all-time favourite singer?

02:45.480 --> 02:48.160
&lrm;That's right, requested
&lrm;by Jagged himself.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.960
&lrm;I brought a few visuals
&lrm;so you can get an idea.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.200
&lrm;This doesn't seem like Jagged,
&lrm;more like a perfume ad.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.440
&lrm;It's the direction
&lrm;of his new image, more modern.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.200
&lrm;Really?

03:01.360 --> 03:02.760
&lrm;I was thinking more...

03:02.920 --> 03:05.840
&lrm;Don't think.
&lrm;This is what is selling these days.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.200
&lrm;Sure.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.840
&lrm;We're in a hurry, we need a proposal
&lrm;by the end of the day.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.040
&lrm;You up to it?

03:15.720 --> 03:17.280
&lrm;Yeah, OK.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.800
&lrm;[Bob] See you later then.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.520
&lrm;[Tom] My daughter, famous designer.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.720
&lrm;[she groans]

03:40.800 --> 03:43.200
&lrm;Why does Jagged Stone want
&lrm;to change his style?

03:43.360 --> 03:47.160
&lrm;XY's music is so... cold
&lrm;and lifeless, repetitive, mundane...

03:47.320 --> 03:49.000
&lrm;The total opposite of Jagged's.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.960
&lrm;And what I've just done is...

03:51.120 --> 03:52.800
&lrm;so not my style, either.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
&lrm;So why're you doing it, then?

03:55.120 --> 03:56.520
&lrm;That's what I was asked to do.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.000
&lrm;Follow your gut feeling,
&lrm;do something that's really you.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.400
&lrm;But you heard what Mr Roth said,

04:02.560 --> 04:04.720
&lrm;"This is what's selling these days".

04:04.880 --> 04:08.600
&lrm;Yeah, but Jagged Stone wanted you
&lrm;because of your style.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.080
&lrm;[groaning] The pressure... I can't deal...

04:12.240 --> 04:15.000
&lrm;Marinette, superhero,
&lrm;defender of the innocent,

04:15.160 --> 04:18.440
&lrm;fighter of all the rights,
&lrm;can't deal with the pressure?

04:22.840 --> 04:25.120
&lrm;[electronic music]

04:29.520 --> 04:32.880
&lrm;What happened to the raw
&lrm;impulsive artistry that make this?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.360
&lrm;Yeah, about that... Mr Roth told me...

04:35.520 --> 04:37.960
&lrm;She represents our target audience.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.840
&lrm;Her modern concept is
&lrm;exactly what you need.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.600
&lrm;It looks like the cover of that YZ guy.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.160
&lrm;Don't listen to Bob.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.720
&lrm;Can you do another one... Jagged-style?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.280
&lrm;Yeah, sure...

04:49.440 --> 04:50.920
&lrm;But I don't know if...

04:51.080 --> 04:52.920
&lrm;You're my girl, Marinette, remember,

04:53.080 --> 04:54.800

&lrm;She knows you're a fan of Jagged Stone.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.400
&lrm;I am.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.400
&lrm;So... you get a private meeting
&lrm;with your favourite star.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.240
&lrm;He's staying right here in daddy's hotel.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.520
&lrm;Is Chloe the best? Is Chloe the best?

&lrm;Did you hear that?

&lrm;I thought you liked Mr XY.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.760
&lrm;Of course. Don't you?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.040
&lrm;Not really.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.920
&lrm;Well, neither do I.

&lrm;See? We have the same great taste.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.280
&lrm;A duet with Mr XY
&lrm;will prove that Jagged's still...

10:55.320 --> 10:56.440
&lrm;Cat Noir, you OK?

10:56.600 --> 10:58.040
&lrm;Good to see you, milady.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.480
&lrm;Cat Noir, your stick!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.560
&lrm;[he yells]

11:14.160 --> 11:15.240
&lrm;[he chuckles]

11:18.040 --> 11:21.920
&lrm;You're wasting my time.
&lrm;I've got a concert to get to.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.800
&lrm;We've gotta follow him.

11:23.960 --> 11:27.080
&lrm;His power comes from his guitar.
&lrm;We've gotta stop him from playing.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.880
&lrm;I won't let you do this solo.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.880
&lrm;[electronic music]

11:37.960 --> 11:40.800
&lrm;You're an insult to the music world, XY!

11:41.360 --> 11:42.280
&lrm;An hologram?

11:44.720 --> 11:45.920
&lrm;[whimpering]

11:47.480 --> 11:48.720
&lrm;Where's the real XY?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
&lrm;He's not here.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.920
&lrm;The concert's not till tonight.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.000
&lrm;I'm just setting up the special effects.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.760
&lrm;Awesome Solo!

11:56.920 --> 11:59.360
&lrm;[rock music]
&lrm;[exploding]

12:00.320 --> 12:02.000
&lrm;Where's Mr XY? Answer me!

12:02.400 --> 12:04.240
&lrm;On TV. He's at the TV station.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.640
&lrm;Rockin' Riff Baby!

12:07.480 --> 12:09.280
&lrm;[gasping] You again?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.400
&lrm;To the TV studios, Fang.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.560
&lrm;He'll get there before us!

12:19.720 --> 12:22.080
&lrm;We'd better make sure
&lrm;he doesn't find XY.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.080
&lrm;[Mrs &lrm;Chamack]<i>&lrm; Kids plus TV,</i>

12:23.240 --> 12:24.440
&lrm;how can I help?

12:25.640 --> 12:27.200
&lrm;Ladybug says we're in danger.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.720
&lrm;Mr XY, we have to leave now.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.800
&lrm;What the heck?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.840
&lrm;Ladybug said you're not safe.
&lrm;Hit the credits.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.240
&lrm;[dramatic music]

12:39.720 --> 12:41.400
&lrm;Where's that studio?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.120
&lrm;[Receptionist] Third... floor.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.240
&lrm;[frustrated sigh]

12:52.400 --> 12:54.280
&lrm;Awesome Solo!

12:57.560 --> 12:59.360
&lrm;[Alec] Everything will be fine.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.000
&lrm;It's just a precaution.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.720
&lrm;We must get you to safety.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.040
&lrm;What's he gonna do,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.400
&lrm;blow me away with his "evil guitar solo"?

13:06.560 --> 13:07.280
&lrm;YES!

13:07.440 --> 13:09.840
&lrm;We'll catch him,
&lrm;and get you to the Eiffel Tower

13:10.000 --> 13:11.440
&lrm;in time for your live concert.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.640
&lrm;[puffing] Who cares?

13:12.800 --> 13:14.920
&lrm;My roadies can project my image.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.880
&lrm;Live concerts are so 10-minutes-ago.

13:18.280 --> 13:22.560
&lrm;[cackling]

13:25.960 --> 13:27.040
&lrm;[whimpering]

13:27.200 --> 13:28.280
&lrm;Good job, Fang.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.160
&lrm;I've found you at last, XY.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.640
&lrm;Ready for the show?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.400
&lrm;Dude, are you Jagged Stone?

13:33.560 --> 13:36.600
&lrm;Was Jagged Stone...
&lrm;Now I'm Guitar Villain!

13:36.760 --> 13:38.200
&lrm;[he laughs] Don't worry,

13:38.360 --> 13:41.040
&lrm;you don't deserve to become
&lrm;one of my fans.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.400
&lrm;I've got something special
&lrm;in store for you

13:43.560 --> 13:45.840
&lrm;something with a little rock 'n' roll!

13:46.000 --> 13:47.040
&lrm;No!

13:48.280 --> 13:50.080
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Back to square one.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.800
&lrm;We're in for quite a concert. You ready?

13:52.960 --> 13:54.720
&lrm;To Rock 'n' Riff, baby!

14:03.200 --> 14:05.240
&lrm;[rock music]

14:08.000 --> 14:10.080
&lrm;[cheering]

14:15.920 --> 14:18.000
&lrm;[cheering]

14:18.160 --> 14:20.080
&lrm;Hello, Paris!

14:20.920 --> 14:22.240
&lrm;You said your music is

14:22.400 --> 14:24.280
&lrm;the only killer music around,
&lrm;is that right?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.120
&lrm;I-I d-didn't mean it.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.960
&lrm;Listen, Mr... Guitar...

14:28.120 --> 14:31.000
&lrm;we can...do the duet your style.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.400
&lrm;[whimpering]

14:34.720 --> 14:37.120
&lrm;[whimpering]
&lrm;[cackling]

14:37.280 --> 14:40.920
&lrm;Too late. I'm going to show you
&lrm;what killer music really is.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.800
&lrm;Ultimate Solo!

14:43.960 --> 14:45.560
&lrm;[rock music] Stop, please.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.600
&lrm;[Ladybug] <i>&lrm;XY's gonna fall!</i>

14:59.760 --> 15:02.320
&lrm;Talk about being
&lrm;between a rock and a hard place.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.640
&lrm;[yelling]

15:18.840 --> 15:21.240
&lrm;Easy, easy, nice dragon.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.560
&lrm;Enough already,
&lrm;we've got a stuffed kitty to rescue.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.960
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Well, the bug mastered the dragon.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.320
&lrm;How d'you like the concert?

15:42.480 --> 15:45.160
&lrm;Still think your music is
&lrm;the only killer music?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.320
&lrm;N-No. Please... don't.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.440
&lrm;[whimpering]

15:49.600 --> 15:52.320
&lrm;-Awesome Solo...
&lrm;-Not so fast!

15:52.480 --> 15:53.800
&lrm;[dragon roars] My dragon?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.160
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir, hurry!

15:59.280 --> 16:00.320
&lrm;Nice job.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.320
&lrm;Too late.
&lrm;Nothing can stop Guitar Villain.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.240
&lrm;Rockin' Riff Baby!

16:06.400 --> 16:09.560
&lrm;We only rock to the real Jagged Stone.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.800
&lrm;The Akuma must be in his guitar.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.480
&lrm;How we gonna get to that?

16:15.640 --> 16:17.840
&lrm;[Ladybug] Let's go backstage.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.800
&lrm;Where did they go?

16:31.280 --> 16:32.680
&lrm;[groaning]

16:32.840 --> 16:34.080
&lrm;You OK?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.640
&lrm;Too bad.
&lrm;They're gonna miss the final song.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.920
&lrm;[cackling] Solo!

16:46.960 --> 16:48.640
&lrm;[whimpering]

16:48.800 --> 16:50.320
&lrm;Are you scared?

16:50.480 --> 16:52.600
&lrm;Or is it too awesome for you?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.240
&lrm;Please, Mr Guitar Villain.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.240
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:02.680 --> 17:05.640
&lrm;-Extreme fixing gel?
&lrm;-You plan on doing his hair?

17:05.800 --> 17:06.680
&lrm;[rock music]

17:11.599 --> 17:13.200
&lrm;Actually, yes!

17:13.640 --> 17:14.880
&lrm;Go get him, Cat Noir!

17:17.319 --> 17:19.560
&lrm;Maybe you haven't heard it properly.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.960
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:39.520 --> 17:41.080
&lrm;Awesome Solo!

17:46.240 --> 17:47.640
&lrm;[he groans]

17:51.520 --> 17:53.320
&lrm;[he screams]

17:53.480 --> 17:55.360
&lrm;I can't see! Where are my fans?

17:58.040 --> 17:58.920
&lrm;[XY] <i>&lrm;Hey,</i>

17:59.080 --> 18:00.200
&lrm;don't forget me!

18:00.360 --> 18:01.280
&lrm;[screaming]

18:03.120 --> 18:05.040
&lrm;[he squeals]

18:10.680 --> 18:12.360
&lrm;Music's over, Akuma.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.640
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:22.160 --> 18:23.120
&lrm;Rock 'n' Roll!

18:24.240 --> 18:26.040
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.520
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:37.720 --> 18:38.920
&lrm;POUND IT!

18:39.080 --> 18:41.000
&lrm;What's he doing here?

18:41.160 --> 18:44.920
&lrm;He came to tell you that
&lrm;you've underestimated his music

18:45.080 --> 18:46.360
&lrm;This guy's crazy!

18:46.520 --> 18:47.600
&lrm;Thank you.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.680
&lrm;How about an autograph, Jagged?

18:50.640 --> 18:53.120
&lrm;I still have work to do. Bug out!

18:53.280 --> 18:54.560
&lrm;[they gasp]

18:56.440 --> 18:59.960
&lrm;Don't do your victory dance
&lrm;just yet, because one day,

19:00.120 --> 19:02.120
&lrm;I'll play you my favourite music,

19:02.280 --> 19:06.240
&lrm;the anthem of your defeat,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir!

19:08.720 --> 19:12.440
&lrm;[rock music]

19:12.600 --> 19:13.720
&lrm;Done!

19:16.760 --> 19:18.640
&lrm;Jagged Stone will love it.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.560
&lrm;I hope so, it's 100% Marinette.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.840
&lrm;It's my... awesome solo!

19:24.000 --> 19:25.480
&lrm;[Tikki] Rock 'n' Roll!

19:29.480 --> 19:30.720
&lrm;Yeah, this is it.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.960
&lrm;You did it, girl.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.920
&lrm;I can almost smell
&lrm;the leather and sweat

19:34.080 --> 19:35.720
&lrm;radiating off of this design.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.920
&lrm;[he sniffs]

19:37.080 --> 19:39.240
&lrm;You actually are smelling it.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.000
&lrm;I made a scented sticker
&lrm;for your album.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.120
&lrm;I want it. I gotta have it.
&lrm;It's authentic. It's original.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.600
&lrm;It's...so jagged.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.840
&lrm;No, you can't. It's not what...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
&lrm;Fine, then I'm outta here.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.240
&lrm;I'm sure another record company
&lrm;would be perfectly happy

19:52.400 --> 19:53.840
&lrm;with a No 2 chart-topper.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.880
&lrm;[Bob huffs]

20:02.240 --> 20:03.440
&lrm;[excited squealing]

20:03.600 --> 20:05.280
&lrm;I've just designed the cover

20:05.440 --> 20:07.320
&lrm;for Jagged Stone's new album.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.600
&lrm;I'm so proud of you, Marinette

20:09.760 --> 20:12.720
<i>&lrm;Jagged Stone's new album</i>
<i>&lrm;hit the charts at No 1,</i>

20:12.880 --> 20:15.120

20:15.280 --> 20:17.000

20:20.840 --> 20:21.880
&lrm;Hey, Marinette.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.080
&lrm;I'm a huge fan of Jagged Stone's

20:24.240 --> 20:26.480
&lrm;and I saw you designed
&lrm;his album cover.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.160
&lrm;I-I did. Crazy, isn't it?

20:29.320 --> 20:32.400
&lrm;I wanted to ask if...
&lrm;I could get it... autographed?

20:32.560 --> 20:35.200
&lrm;O-OK, sure... I'll ask him.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.480
&lrm;No... actually, I meant you.

20:40.040 --> 20:40.920
&lrm;Me?...Me?

20:41.880 --> 20:43.920
&lrm;If you wouldn't mind.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.440
&lrm;Awesome! Thanks, Marinette.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.400
&lrm;[growling]

20:49.560 --> 20:53.240
&lrm;Did I imagine it or did you sign
&lrm;an autograph for Adrien?

20:53.400 --> 20:56.680
&lrm;I can't feel my legs.
&lrm;Hold me up. I'm gonna fall over.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.120
&lrm;Is he still around?

20:58.280 --> 21:00.440
&lrm;It's OK, he's gone. You can fall over.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.160
&lrm;This is the happiest day of my life.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.320
&lrm;[Marinette] Rock 'n' Roll!
