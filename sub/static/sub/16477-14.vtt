WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.306
(bird cawing)

00:08.342 --> 00:09.677
(doorbell rings)

00:09.710 --> 00:13.247
Paco's Pizza here to greet ya!

00:18.219 --> 00:20.054
(doorbell rings)

00:20.088 --> 00:23.291
Answer the door,
let me meet ya!

00:26.627 --> 00:27.795
(line ringing)

00:27.828 --> 00:29.430
Hey. It's me.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.698
(on phone): What's up, Zeke?
Check that address again.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.266
I got another no-show.
(on phone): What?

00:32.300 --> 00:33.534
It's our stupid

00:33.567 --> 00:36.070
phone app.
I think there's a glitch.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.174
Hello?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.183
Are you okay?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.155
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.356
No, no, no, no, no.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.396
*

01:31.825 --> 01:34.328
(phone ringing,
low office chatter)

01:38.299 --> 01:40.234
What are you workin' on, Nick?

01:40.268 --> 01:42.603
TORRES: Just going over
that Norfolk case.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.806
We did pretty good work
in there.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.541
That's a pretty long report.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.144
Maybe you want
to take a load off.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.579
TORRES:
I will.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.582
Eventually.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.822
Okay, fine, Alex. Just take it.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.657
Ha!

02:04.492 --> 02:05.459
Finally.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.460
Wait, what's happening?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.162
Excuse me.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.898
Ooh, come to Mama.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.533
Drinks on me later.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.703
Bishop bet me
that you would sit in that chair

02:15.736 --> 02:16.904
by the end of the day.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.306
It's been three days.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.373
Wait, hold on. You're telling me

02:19.407 --> 02:21.175
that it's been three whole days

02:21.209 --> 02:22.743
since I sat on this chair?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.313
Days, weeks, months. Maybe ever.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.715
You're being dramatic.
(chuckles) I sit here plenty.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.817
Huh. Then sit now.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.819
Yeah, sit.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.755
Well, I'm not gonna sit now
'cause you're telling me to.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.357
(groans)

02:37.458 --> 02:38.959
Fine.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.430
I don't get the big idea.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.697
GIBBS:
On your feet.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.599
Dead petty officer in Hastings.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.967
McGee will meet us there.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.536
See?
That's why I like to stand.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.904
I'm a man of action.
Stayin' on my toes!

02:50.938 --> 02:52.172
Who won the $20?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.546
MAN: What'd you see when you
looked in the window there?

02:58.579 --> 03:01.482
Why'd you step inside?
I saw her on the floor.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.451
(camera shutter clicking)

03:03.484 --> 03:06.687
Is it wrong that
I'm suddenly craving a slice?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.422
Oh, no,
I know a joint in Brooklyn--

03:08.456 --> 03:10.691
puts all others to shame.

03:10.724 --> 03:14.228
(camera shutter clicking)

03:14.262 --> 03:18.599
Boss, victim is Petty Officer
Second Class Maya Kettering.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.901
26 years old.
Stationed out of Norfolk.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.304
Place is tossed.
Maybe a robbery gone wrong?

03:23.337 --> 03:24.772
No sign of forced
entry, front or back.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.907
Alarm wasn't tripped,
so either the killer

03:26.940 --> 03:28.509
bypassed it or...

03:28.542 --> 03:30.311
Or she knew the guy.
She let him in.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.979
You meet the sheriff?
Yeah.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.315
He's a real, um, Barney Fife.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.784
Ah. Maynard County's
a bit Mayberry-ish.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.652
Small-town law enforcement.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.988
Locate the victim's husband?
Yeah, the sheriff said
he's on a plane.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.923
He was in San Francisco
on business, and he's on his way

03:42.956 --> 03:44.525
back to D.C. now.
All right.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.527
Have agents there to meet him.
Yes, sir.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.928
Duck, cause of death.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.598
Ah, Jethro, you know
I hate to speculate,

03:50.631 --> 03:53.033
particularly if I haven't done
my complete examination.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.269
I'll bet he speculates anyway.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.004
Well, take a look
at her eyes.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.941
This subconjunctival
hemorrhaging would indicate...

04:00.974 --> 04:02.576
MAN:
Strangulation.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.282
Walter?
Dr. Mallard.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.850
And I prefer Sheriff Osorio

04:09.883 --> 04:11.552
while we're on
official business.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.554
That's the Barney Fife
I was telling you about.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.823
Oh, my God.
Miss me, Gibbs?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.291
You're the sheriff?
Well, I thought
Dr. Palmer

04:17.325 --> 04:18.726
would've told you by now.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.596
No, he did not.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.965
(chuckles)
I-I completely forgot.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.901
I-I remember you were elected,
but-but the-the where

04:27.935 --> 04:29.370
somehow eluded me.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.771
You're looking well, Donald.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.005
You'll be happy
to know that

04:32.039 --> 04:33.441
Jimmy filled your position

04:33.474 --> 04:35.576
with the Sherlocks seamlessly.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.910
I had little doubt.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.779
The Sherlocks?
It's a long story.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.714
Wait, you know this guy?
Even longer story.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.750
Don't sweat
jurisdiction, Gibbs.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.851
I was the one
who called you in.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.587
And rest assured, I'll be happy
to let your NCIS team

04:46.620 --> 04:47.988
work with me.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.591
I appreciate
that, Sheriff.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
Man, I love the sound of that.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.362
Ain't it great
to have the gang

04:54.395 --> 04:56.997
back together?
(chuckles)

04:57.030 --> 04:59.533
Boss, what was that?

04:59.567 --> 05:03.070
That was Sheriff Osorio.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.440
I'll just say it-- uh, this
one's on me. (clears throat)

05:06.474 --> 05:08.642
What was that? What was he
saying about letting our team

05:08.676 --> 05:11.812
work with his? Isn't this where
we usually claim jurisdiction?

05:11.845 --> 05:12.980
That didn't do much good
last time.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.982
Wait, I'm sorry,
last time?

05:15.015 --> 05:16.384
Really long story.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.720
Keep your friends close

05:19.753 --> 05:21.689
and the crazies
even closer.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.394
(clocking chiming)
A murder?

05:26.427 --> 05:29.430
We just hit the jackpot!

05:29.463 --> 05:31.632
Not so fast, Lyle.
This is a Maynard County case,

05:31.665 --> 05:32.966
not a Sherlock case.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.469
Oh, Walty Walt. Let us help.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.938
Uh, unofficially, maybe.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.941
Probie! Where are
those pigs in a blanket?

05:40.974 --> 05:42.410
Sheriff's hungry!

05:42.443 --> 05:43.944
JUDITH:
It's late.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.813
Where's Dr. Palmer?
He's been held up.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
Your victim is Navy.
Oh, give me that.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.149
Navy?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.084
You saw Special Agent Gibbs?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.986
We've dealt
with NCIS before.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.522
What is the problem?

05:54.555 --> 05:57.057
Gibbs. He's a hard nut to crack.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.959
I'd love to have a crack at him.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.394
MAN:
Did you say...

06:00.428 --> 06:01.829
"Special Agent Gibbs"?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.096
You know him, probie?

06:03.130 --> 06:05.966
Indeed I do.
We're old friends.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.971
We go way back.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.451
McGEE:
Sheriff Walt Osorio,

06:23.484 --> 06:25.018
author Judith McKnight,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.888
Lyle No Last Name,
and Jimmy Palmer.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.990
Together, they make up
the Sherlock Consortium

06:30.023 --> 06:31.492
for Investigation.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.160
What does that
mean, exactly?

06:33.193 --> 06:36.430
It's a privately funded
investigative team.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.599
Brilliant minds from diverse
backgrounds get together

06:38.632 --> 06:41.034
and tackle
unsolved cases.
What? They look like

06:41.068 --> 06:42.503
a bunch of wackos.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.104
Oh. No offense, Jimmy.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.973
Oh, none taken.
We get that a lot.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.576
But we're actually quite adept
at crime-solving.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.011
We are a quintet now.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.180
We had a new member join
a few weeks ago.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.082
You guys know him, actually.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.884
Who?
No.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.151
I can't reveal his identity.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.152
No, no, no.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.554
Breaking the oath of secrecy

07:00.588 --> 07:02.556
would have
serious repercussions.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.458
Jimmy.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.127
(stammering)

07:07.160 --> 07:10.564
Okay, okay. I-I can give you,
like, a little hint.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.600
I shouldn't be
doing this. Um,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.868
he's related to Tony.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.237
Senior? How did he get involved?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.740
It was Tony's idea.
Yeah. It's a funny story.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.075
Uh, Gibbs.
Oh, Gibbs. Yeah,

07:22.109 --> 07:25.078
he would fit right in.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.852
Cheerio.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.886
Give me an update.
Yes.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.088
QUINN: Our victim is
Petty Officer Maya Kettering.

07:35.122 --> 07:39.092
Stationed aboard the USS
Tallahassee out of Norfolk.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.895
Last time she used her
cell phone was 3:17 p.m. today.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.897
Who'd she call?
No one. She used

07:43.931 --> 07:45.132
a food app
to order lunch.
Yeah,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.868
the pizza delivery guy found
the body in 30 minutes or less.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.136
(chuckles)

07:49.169 --> 07:51.038
Suspects. What do we know
about her husband?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.039
QUINN:
Michael Kettering, 30.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.542
Graphic designer in Centreville.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.276
His plane land yet?
Yeah, an hour ago.
Agents met him

07:56.309 --> 07:58.612
at the airport. He's in the
conference room with Bishop now.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.914
MICHAEL:
Every time

08:00.948 --> 08:03.917
Maya deployed,
I lived in this constant...

08:03.951 --> 08:05.753
state of fear.

08:05.786 --> 08:10.123
I thought home was gonna be the
one place that she'd be safe.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.060
How did this happen?

08:13.093 --> 08:15.563
We're trying to figure that out,
Mr. Kettering.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.230
I begged her to use
the home security system,

08:17.264 --> 08:18.632
but she hated the thing.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.767
But you used it?
We both are gone

08:19.800 --> 08:21.201
so much for work,

08:21.234 --> 08:24.772
and I wasn't comfortable
stashing money in the house.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.839
"Stashing"?
Yeah,

08:25.873 --> 08:26.974
it was nothing illegal.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.710
$5,000. Our-our emergency fund.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.711
Where?
In a coffee can

08:30.744 --> 08:32.079
in the freezer.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.582
Is that what this was?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.784
A robbery?
It's possible.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.786
Was your wife having problems
with anyone?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.221
She ever mention any enemies?
How?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.657
She wasn't home
for the last year.
How 'bout

08:43.691 --> 08:45.726
on the Tallahassee?

08:45.759 --> 08:48.195
I flew to Rota, Spain,
last month

08:48.228 --> 08:50.130
when her ship docked for R & R.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.132
She said
that she had just had a blowout

08:52.165 --> 08:54.735
with her department head.
About what?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.036
Well, Maya didn't want
to talk about it.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.040
I should've asked
more questions.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.913
I should've done
a lot of things.
Um,

09:05.946 --> 09:08.882
we have to process your home
for evidence tonight.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.218
Do you have someplace to stay?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.756
Mr. Kettering,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.758
do you have someplace
to sleep tonight?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.760
(shuddering inhale)

09:19.793 --> 09:22.630
Uh... yeah.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.666
Yeah, I do.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.638
Thanks for letting me do
the cervical artery dissection

09:30.671 --> 09:33.040
today, Doctor.
You earned it, Doctor.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.343
How would you like to deliver
our findings to Gibbs?

09:36.376 --> 09:38.779
Really?
I can do it, if you prefer.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.947
No, I'll do it.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.949
You called me, Duck?
Yes, Jethro.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.684
My initial assessment

09:43.717 --> 09:46.186
of Petty Officer Kettering's
cause of death

09:46.219 --> 09:48.188
has proven to be correct.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.923
It was, uh...
it was strangulation.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.058
Uh, more precisely,
it was, uh,

09:51.091 --> 09:54.662
asphyxiation due to hypoxia.
Now then,

09:54.695 --> 09:59.800
a damaged hyoid bone would be a
telltale sign of strangulation.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.068
But it's not applicable
in this case.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.002
And why is that?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.237
Because our victim is 26.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.973
Which is relevant because...?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.341
Because the hyoid bone doesn't
fully form until the age of 30.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.276
Very good, Doctor.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.344
Thank you, Doctor.
Why do I need to be here?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.146
Uh, oh.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.015
During our examination,

10:15.048 --> 10:17.084
we found this rash on her neck

10:17.117 --> 10:18.686
and lower back.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.087
Poison ivy?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.823
Not at this time of year.
No, whatever caused this

10:22.856 --> 10:23.824
is inorganic.
I pulled some fibers

10:23.857 --> 10:26.226
from the abrasions there
and sent 'em up to Abby.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.829
She should be
analyzing 'em now.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.699
Good work.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
Doctors.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.874
I liked it better
when he called me Jimmy.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.112
I-I don't believe it.
That can't be right.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.880
It was a published study,
my friend.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.116
Sitting is the new smoking.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.851
Now, which magazine was this?

10:50.884 --> 10:53.153
Popular Science. So legit.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.922
Or was it GQ?

10:54.955 --> 10:56.857
Oh. Well, then
it must be true.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.860
Seals are broken.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.128
(alarm chirping,
clattering inside)

11:01.161 --> 11:03.697
(alarm wailing)

11:05.966 --> 11:07.234
(alarm stops)
NCIS!

11:07.267 --> 11:08.969
On the ground!

11:10.103 --> 11:11.739
Me?

11:11.772 --> 11:14.074
No, the other blond guy
holding the other alarm box.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.010
Yeah, you, genius.
Drop the weapon.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.746
(laughs)

11:20.748 --> 11:22.883
It's just a screwdriver, bro.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.822
Whoa. (grunting)

11:28.856 --> 11:30.758
Are you robbing me?

11:30.791 --> 11:31.792
I'm calling the cops.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.826
TORRES:
We are the cops.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.894
Try to keep up, kid.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.163
Oh...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.197
Hey, that's my wallet.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.933
Taj Robinson,
D.C. address.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.835
Taj, this is an
active crime scene.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.036
What are you doing here?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.372
Bro, I'm a Voltrane
alarm technician.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.474
All right? I was called here
to remove the unit.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.943
Who called you?
I did.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.278
Walt?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.080
what are you doing here?
Same thing you are.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.882
Conducting a murder
investigation.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.316
Kindly remove
your size sevens

11:56.349 --> 11:58.085
and let Taj do his job.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.821
It's, uh, size 11, pops.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.222
Yeah. Keep dreaming, kid.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.191
Why did you not notify NCIS
you were coming here?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.826
Why didn't you notify
the sheriff's department

12:05.859 --> 12:07.027
that you were coming?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.328
Uh, can I finish up here?

12:08.361 --> 12:10.030
No.
Yes.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.099
Walt, we have it
from here, okay?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.366
It's Sheriff Osorio,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.036
and this is a joint
investigation.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.371
You've got the husband,
so I'll take the alarm box.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.241
And if you find anything on it,
you'll share it with NCIS?

12:21.274 --> 12:22.442
Sure.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
Well, that sounds convincing.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.815
Let's check the freezer.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.818
Yeah, if you're looking
for money,

12:30.851 --> 12:32.820
it's gone.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.922
I just checked
myself.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.257
All they've got in there
is some chicken cutlets

12:37.290 --> 12:39.092
and an empty coffee can.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.928
How'd you know it
was a money stash?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.796
Toilet, freezer, mattress.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.798
The go-to spots.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.967
How much was in the coffee can?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.269
Apparently enough to kill for.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.540
Hmm.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.310
Just returned from a six-month
deployment in the Med.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.079
How long had
Petty Officer Kettering

12:59.112 --> 13:00.280
been stationed onboard?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.249
Three years, same as me.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.917
And what kind of sailor was she?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.485
"Was."

13:05.518 --> 13:06.920
It's hard to believe.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.421
She had a bright future
ahead of her.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.224
As her C.O., I take
this loss personally.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.560
We'd like to speak with
her department head.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.162
She's on her way in.
You can wait in the wardroom

13:15.195 --> 13:16.396
with your other agents.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.532
What other agents?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.975
Well, hello, sailor.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.576
Gibbs. Eleanor.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.112
Surprise.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.214
Chief. Seriously?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.283
H-How did you
get onto the base?

13:36.316 --> 13:39.286
The Sherlock Consortium
isn't a law-enforcement agency.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.322
We're not Sherlocks.
We're deputies.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.524
Excuse me?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.328
JUDITH:
Sheriff Walt deputized us.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.498
Guess who's got a new set
of handcuffs?

13:52.532 --> 13:53.566
Hmm.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.582
And so I discovered
that bylaw 357

14:09.616 --> 14:12.452
of the Commonwealth of Virginia
allows county sheriffs

14:12.485 --> 14:15.588
to hire, and fire,
as they see fit.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.324
Walt hired us last night.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.159
You got a badge, too?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.462
Afraid not. I'm a probationary
member of the Sherlocks.

14:22.495 --> 14:27.034
My role here is to
observe and learn.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.035
He's our pledge.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.937
Sheriff give you weapons, too?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.172
Probie. My weapon?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.210
You're gonna like this.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.478
A cell phone?

14:38.511 --> 14:41.048
(electrical buzzing)

14:41.081 --> 14:43.550
A stun gun.

14:43.583 --> 14:48.155
Bad boys get 300,000 volts
to the crotch.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.991
(buzzing)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
Want to know what good boys get?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.495
Oh, boy.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.697
Since we're law
enforcement equals now,

14:57.730 --> 15:00.167
how about a little
quid pro quo?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.368
You want to help?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.503
Stay in your clubhouse.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.138
Out of our way.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
It's called concurrent
jurisdiction,

15:07.274 --> 15:08.641
Agent Gibbs.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.310
You're stuck with us.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.512
(sighs) Gibbs.
Where are you going?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.547
Overboard.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.584
Mm, that man turns me
into molten lava.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.004
Torres.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.271
What are you doing?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.406
You called me.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.141
Not so you could spy on me.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.209
I'm not spying.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.743
I'm... I'm just admiring.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.413
You know, you have
this entire open floor plan.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.615
You're there, then you're here,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.483
then you're everywhere.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.352
I'm a mover, it helps me think.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.453
Yeah. Not a chair in sight.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.588
It's awesome.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.190
So what do you got?

15:57.224 --> 15:59.459
Well, our killer was
very, very careful.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.294
There is no DNA
under her fingernails,

16:01.328 --> 16:03.396
there's no blood, there's
no fingerprints, nothing.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.597
TORRES:
But.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.766
There's always a "but."

16:06.799 --> 16:08.735
But the fibers
that were embedded in the rash

16:08.768 --> 16:12.439
on Petty Officer
Kettering's back and neck,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.242
they're a match to the carpet
in her living room.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.310
So that rash is rug burn?

16:17.344 --> 16:21.648
Yeah. So her killer dragged
her to the front door,

16:21.681 --> 16:25.418
and then, either was
interrupted by pizza kid,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.320
or...
Or...

16:27.354 --> 16:29.189
her killer wanted her
to be found.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.295
WOMAN:
I've been Maya's
department head

16:35.328 --> 16:36.663
for the past three years.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.099
She was as squared away
as they come.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.667
When's the last
time you two spoke?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.602
Yesterday morning
in the chap's office.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.138
Told her to enjoy her leave.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.707
Excuse me.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.643
This is all just hitting me now.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.212
JUDITH: Who's this "chap"
she was with?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.447
"Chap" is short
for chaplain.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.782
Maya helped coordinate
the Catholic services

16:55.815 --> 16:57.184
aboard the ship.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.785
Write that down.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.087
On it, boss.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.221
How'd the two of you get along?

17:01.254 --> 17:04.057
You're not supposed
to have favorites,

17:04.091 --> 17:05.758
but she was
one of mine.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.327
I never told her that.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.363
In fact,
I was extra hard on her

17:10.397 --> 17:12.632
because I saw
how much potential Maya had.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.733
What about the argument
the two of you had

17:13.766 --> 17:15.402
in Rota a few weeks ago?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.205
That more tough love?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.140
You could say that.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.241
What would you say?

17:21.274 --> 17:23.176
(whispers loudly):
He's got her cornered.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.213
Sorry.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.780
It was about Maya's leave time.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.516
She wanted more?
Less.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.152
I had to practically order her
to take a few days off.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.753
She have a reason
for wanting to stay onboard?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.423
Don't dance around it.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.226
Agent Bishop's saying this
ship is full of seamen.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261
No. Not Maya.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.762
For as long
as I've known her,

17:42.795 --> 17:44.697
she never even looked
at another man.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.266
She was married.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.701
She took that vow
very seriously.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.571
(knocking "Shave and a Haircut")

17:51.604 --> 17:52.839
(buzzer sounds)

18:00.180 --> 18:02.715
Hello?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.117
Ah.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.386
Special Agent McGee. Over here.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.724
This is Maynard County
Sheriff's office?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.194
The real one is a dump
I have to share with the mayor,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.563
so I use the Sherlocks' den.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.765
And we have dessert.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.800
So, uh, Gibbs mentioned that,

18:20.833 --> 18:22.669
uh, you found something
on the alarm?

18:22.702 --> 18:26.506
Depends. Do you have
Maya Kettering's autopsy report?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.246
Lyle.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.350
Agent McGee, are you familiar
with the Internet?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.818
I've heard of it.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.487
Fast-forward to
the end, Lyle.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.356
Okay. We dug up dirt on the
husband, Mike Kettering.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.658
WALT:
He's got an airtight
alibi, we know.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.594
But he has a secret.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.862
He doesn't live at home
on weekends.
How do you know that?

18:49.896 --> 18:52.299
From the alarm panel
we removed from their house.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.701
Every time the code is entered,
it records the time and date.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.803
WALT:
And the code
was never entered

18:56.836 --> 18:58.605
between Friday mornings
and Monday nights

18:58.638 --> 18:59.739
for the last
three months.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.708
Booyakasha.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.476
Let me take a look at the panel.
It's, uh, technically

19:03.510 --> 19:06.213
not functioning right now,
but keep... keep your coolio.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.280
I downloaded
the schematics.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.681
But...

19:08.715 --> 19:10.417
that's something, right?
I don't know.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.452
It depends where Kettering
goes on weekends.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.221
Let's... ask him.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.323
I think it's better
if we don't show him our cards.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.492
I'm with Walt. I think
we do this one covertly.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.928
Look at that.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.798
The two of you just agreed
on something.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.605
(elevator bell dings)

19:32.639 --> 19:34.207
(groans softly)

19:34.241 --> 19:35.708
Oh, hey, Quinn.
(clear throat)

19:35.742 --> 19:37.777
What are you doing down here?
I'm sifting through

19:37.810 --> 19:41.514
every unsolved burglary
in the tri-state area

19:41.548 --> 19:43.250
and trying to find a pattern.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.518
I know what you're doing.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.255
You came down here
so you could hang out

19:48.288 --> 19:50.490
with all these old solved cases

19:50.523 --> 19:52.392
and hopefully get
some good juju.
Hmm.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.460
What brings you down here?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.928
Tracking where Mike Kettering

19:55.962 --> 19:57.497
has been spending his weekends.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.266
By using his wife's
cell phone?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.900
Thanks. Sort of.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.336
Three Sundays ago,
there was a power surge,

20:03.370 --> 20:04.671
and it tripped their alarm.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.240
He wasn't home, so he had
to turn it off remotely.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.409
Oh, by using one of those apps
on the phone.
Exactly.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.678
For security, the I.P. address

20:11.711 --> 20:13.480
is captured whenever it's used.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.781
Like three Sundays ago.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.416
Well, couldn't you use
the I.P. address

20:16.449 --> 20:18.785
to locate
Kettering's whereabouts?
I can.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.821
Problem is, it could take hours
or even days.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.524
(computer chirping)

20:25.558 --> 20:28.295
Or seconds. I am that good.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.829
I believe you.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.698
Fredericksburg.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.301
That's, like... 60 miles
away from Hastings.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.835
What was he doing there?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.704
I don't know,
but Torres likes

20:37.737 --> 20:40.573
a good stakeout.
(chuckles)

20:40.607 --> 20:42.041
(door closes)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.710
Gibbs?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.313
Yeah, Chief, come on in.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.615
Sorry to intrude.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.883
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.787
You expecting someone?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.022
Yeah. You.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.457
Sit down.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.059
Junior wasn't exaggerating about

21:00.092 --> 21:02.729
the Gibbs gut.
What's on your mind?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.464
(sighs):
Well, uh...

21:04.497 --> 21:06.533
I know that you're
not too thrilled

21:06.566 --> 21:08.768
about me working
with the Sherlocks,

21:08.801 --> 21:11.371
and, uh,
I wanted to explain.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.506
There's nothing to explain.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.676
You know, uh,
I went to visit Junior

21:16.709 --> 21:18.778
at Christmas in Paris

21:18.811 --> 21:20.380
with little Tali.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.350
She's adorable.
He's an amazing father.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.485
I came back, and...

21:25.518 --> 21:27.687
I fell into a little funk.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.490
A big funk, actually.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.625
I tried everything.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.361
Nothing seemed
to fill the void.

21:34.394 --> 21:38.030
And then Junior, he, um,
he suggested the Sherlocks,

21:38.064 --> 21:40.567
and he put in a call.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.369
I admit they're out there,

21:42.402 --> 21:44.637
but they got my blood
flowing again.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.906
Hey, you're happy,
I'm happy.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.708
Which, uh...

21:48.741 --> 21:51.478
brings me to my, uh...
next topic.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.714
It's, uh,
rather a delicate matter.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.018
It's about, uh, Judith.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.922
Your ex-lover.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.992
(coughs)

22:06.025 --> 22:07.760
My ex-what?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.629
Oh, you're still an item?
No!

22:09.662 --> 22:11.631
No item. Not... No, not ever.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.865
I understand,
I understand.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.602
A gentleman never
kisses and tells.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.537
I won't intrude,
but, uh,

22:17.570 --> 22:19.706
I would like your blessing.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.409
For what?
To woo Judith.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.678
That woman turns me
into molten lava.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.779
Ah, geez.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.981
Is that a yes?
Yeah. Sure.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.149
Woo away.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.418
Tremendous.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.485
Stupendous.
Woo, woo away from me.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.486
Oh, that's great.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.755
You are a class act, Gibbs.

22:35.788 --> 22:36.889
I owe you one.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.426
Hey, can I get this
to go?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.161
Thanks.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.833
LYLE: So you think of your
office as a prison.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.935
Subconsciously,
is what I'm saying.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.838
Therefore, your desk
is your cell,

22:51.871 --> 22:54.474
and your chair
is what, Nick?

22:54.507 --> 22:56.709
Solitary confinement.

22:56.743 --> 23:00.813
And nobody wants to be
in solitary confinement.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.583
Solitary confinement sounds
pretty good right now.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.753
Okay, Lyle, it's time
for the silent game.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.755
(groans)

23:08.788 --> 23:11.591
This looks like
Kettering's car.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.593
Here we go.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.898
Yup, that's him.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.132
(shutter clicking)

23:20.166 --> 23:22.635
And he's got company.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.137
Let's do this.
Wait, wait. Wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.174
No, we sit and watch.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.842
I feel you.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.712
Who's the dame?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.848
Brunette, about 30.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.485
She's carrying a bag.
Looks like groceries.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.754
LYLE:
Our research said

23:41.788 --> 23:43.022
he has a sister.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.491
Mm.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.761
TORRES:
Ooh!

23:49.929 --> 23:52.465
That is not his sister.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.173
WOMAN:
Mike?

24:01.207 --> 24:04.143
You mean my Mike?
Kettering?

24:04.176 --> 24:06.145
Your Mike Kettering.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.581
You've got the wrong guy.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.517
Maybe you got the
wrong guy.
We're engaged.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.851
He proposed three months ago.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.486
We're getting married
this summer.

24:15.722 --> 24:19.826
Darlene, your fiancé
is already married.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.497
No, that...
simply isn't possible.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.774
Oh, my God. Where did
you get this?
From their home

24:34.807 --> 24:36.042
in Hastings.
TORRES:
His wife's name

24:36.075 --> 24:37.276
was Maya Kettering.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.211
She was murdered two days ago.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.813
We're investigating

24:40.847 --> 24:43.115
her death.
Are you saying
Mike is a suspect?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.585
He would never
be capable of murder.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.119
You sure about that?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.588
He was capable of duping you
for nine months.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.858
No.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.693
You're wrong.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.262
Can you tell us where you were
two days ago, Darlene?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.964
I was at work.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.767
I-I'm a nurse at...

25:02.001 --> 25:05.171
Wait. Now I'm a suspect?

25:13.780 --> 25:17.116
You told her that
I was married?!
(scoffs)

25:17.149 --> 25:18.685
How could you not tell her?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.152
You have to let me talk to her.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.954
Mm.
You have ruined
everything!

25:21.988 --> 25:24.624
Everything, really? Well,
your wife was just murdered.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.025
Do you remember her?

25:26.058 --> 25:28.895
(sighs)
Listen to me.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.297
I was devastated
about Maya.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.567
Despite it all...
I loved her.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.603
But Darlene
is my soul mate.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.771
Oh. Right.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.907
And you forgot to
mention your soul mate

25:40.940 --> 25:42.942
to Agent Bishop when
she interviewed you?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.644
Because I didn't
want this to happen.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.946
Hey, I admit I am no saint,

25:46.979 --> 25:49.716
but infidelity's not a crime.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.350
Murder is.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.786
Can you stop wasting your time
with me

25:53.820 --> 25:55.655
and find Maya's killer?

25:55.688 --> 25:58.090
Tell us about Darlene.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.797
We met a few months
after Maya last deployed.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.133
I was lonely.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.335
And a...

26:09.368 --> 26:11.704
one-night stand turned
into a week,

26:11.738 --> 26:14.140
and then a month, and...

26:14.173 --> 26:17.076
(sighs)

26:17.109 --> 26:19.612
What can I say?
We fell in love.

26:19.646 --> 26:20.813
You moved in with her.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.849
Yeah, on weekends.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.951
Told her that I lived in Dallas.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.953
I was gonna tell her the truth,

26:26.986 --> 26:30.022
but the original lie
just kept... snowballing, and...

26:30.056 --> 26:31.958
Until your wife came home.
I was gonna

26:31.991 --> 26:34.260
ask for a divorce.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.930
But then... your agents met me
in the airport with...

26:39.131 --> 26:41.701
...that horrible news.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.970
Horrible?

26:44.003 --> 26:46.005
Sounds like problem solved.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.140
I mean, for you and Darlene.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.013
Darlene didn't do this.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.082
She didn't even know about Maya.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.287
What if she found out?

27:04.123 --> 27:07.426
I'm in a charming
château in Bordeaux,

27:07.459 --> 27:10.963
and the sommelier
gave me this bottle,

27:10.997 --> 27:13.800
and he says,
"Entre deux coeurs

27:13.833 --> 27:18.905
"en s'aiment,
nul besoin de paroles,"

27:18.938 --> 27:20.406
which loosely means,

27:20.439 --> 27:25.411
"Two hearts in love
need no words."

27:25.444 --> 27:28.447
Words are overrated.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.849
(clink)

27:29.882 --> 27:31.383
Oh.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.024
Look at the time.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.859
It's gin-thirty.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.061
Be a dear and make
mama a martini?

27:42.094 --> 27:44.430
Of course.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.067
Hope you like it,

27:48.100 --> 27:50.069
uh... dirty?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.939
Filthy.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.942
Mm.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.911
Yeah, I'm gonna go
someplace else.

27:58.945 --> 28:02.048
You fried the resistor
on the motion-detector wire.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.750
So? Fix it.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.051
It's not that easy.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.418
Lyle, sorry
to interrupt.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.821
Uh, can you give this
to Walt when he gets back?

28:08.855 --> 28:11.057
It is the airport
surveillance video he requested.

28:11.090 --> 28:15.027
Dr. Palmer, do you know how to
assemble a Voltrane alarm panel?

28:15.061 --> 28:16.796
Uh, uh, no.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.465
Neither does my friend Taj here,
which is surprising because

28:19.498 --> 28:22.468
he is a Voltrane
alarm technician.
TAJ:
Bro,

28:22.501 --> 28:25.171
I install.
I don't repair.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.839
What's with all
the neggie vibes, man?

28:26.873 --> 28:28.174
Lyle?

28:28.207 --> 28:29.475
Surveillance video.
Yes.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.844
I will give it to Walt.
Great.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.915
What do we know
about Darlene Jones?

28:35.948 --> 28:38.317
Well, she's a neonatal nurse
in Fredericksburg.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.452
No priors, never
been arrested.
Her alibi check out?

28:40.486 --> 28:42.354
Verifying it with
the hospital now.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.257
Any connection between
her and Maya Kettering?
So far, no.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.393
No calls, no texts, no
angry social media posts.

28:47.426 --> 28:51.130
No indication that either one
was aware of the other.
Okay.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.899
Let's go over
Kettering's alibi again.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.434
Way ahead of you, boss. We got
the TSA surveillance video here

28:55.467 --> 28:57.036
from Mike Kettering's flights.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.838
Tracked him all the way
across the country.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.007
McGEE:
San Francisco, 5:06 a.m.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.542
There's, uh, Kettering
going through security.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.044
5:17 a.m.,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.445
there he is in the blue hat

29:06.478 --> 29:08.848
and dark coat, entering
a bathroom in Terminal Six.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.449
McGEE:
Four minutes later,
he exits the men's room

29:10.482 --> 29:11.951
and heads to the gate

29:11.984 --> 29:14.987
where he boards a flight
at 6:18 to Chicago.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.223
He sits in 16C.
BISHOP:
He had a

29:17.256 --> 29:18.925
92-minute layover during

29:18.958 --> 29:20.860
which he took a nap in

29:20.893 --> 29:22.261
that chair.
He then caught

29:22.294 --> 29:23.963
the 1:10 flight to D.C.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.498
Landed an hour and a half
after his wife was killed.

29:26.532 --> 29:29.135
Two of our agents met
him at baggage claim.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.171
As far as alibis go, boss,
this is as airtight as it gets.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.974
What about murder-for-hire?
TORRES: Checked his finances.
No major bank withdrawals,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.509
credit card advances, or lines
of credit in the last year.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.279
Gibbs?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.581
We're missing something.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.316
Torres, McGee,

29:44.350 --> 29:46.819
go with Quinn,
check out the burglary angle.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.855
Uh, what-what do
you want me to do?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.356
You're with me, Bishop.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.159
We're gonna see if the Sherlocks
are holding out on us.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.927
Uh, you sure
that's a good idea?

29:54.961 --> 29:56.428
No.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.332
Quinn, you got that other file?

30:01.968 --> 30:04.136
Aah! I'm sorry,
McGee. I'm sorry.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.172
I'm just getting a little punchy
down here in the salt mines.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.539
Kung pao pollo!

30:07.573 --> 30:09.275
Oh, about time.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.577
All right,
found another one.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.180
What?! This is just...

30:14.213 --> 30:17.483
This is too much
of a coincidence, right?
TORRES: What is?

30:17.516 --> 30:19.351
Eight homes with the
same alarm system

30:19.385 --> 30:21.854
as the Ketterings have been
robbed in the last year.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.956
Everyone goes out and forgets
to put their alarm system on?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.925
Lucky thief.
Yeah. Too lucky.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.927
Moo goo gai pan!
Yeah, let's do this!

30:27.960 --> 30:29.628
QUINN:
I mean, what if there was a way

30:29.661 --> 30:31.630
to know if a system
has been disarmed?
All the alarms

30:31.663 --> 30:33.966
are connected on the
company's private network.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.368
Any Voltrane employee
could have had access.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.170
Hmm.
TORRES
Hey, that alarm tech--

30:38.204 --> 30:39.505
what's his name?
Taj?

30:39.538 --> 30:41.340
You mean Taj?
Yeah.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.875
How'd you know that?
I just saw him at

30:42.909 --> 30:44.576
the Sherlock house.
He's helping Lyle fix the alarm.

30:45.912 --> 30:48.214
Call Gibbs. He's on his way
there. I'll call Lyle.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.918
He is.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.188
Really?

31:00.592 --> 31:02.494
You're sure about that?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.964
You know you
voided the warranty.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.466
I love you, Mom.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.270
(phone beeps)

31:12.271 --> 31:14.173
What?

31:14.206 --> 31:17.977
It'll be over
in seven seconds.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.982
Resisting... is pointless.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.416
(grunts)

31:26.118 --> 31:28.254
(sighs, grunts)

31:28.287 --> 31:30.990
What the hell, bro?
(groans)

31:33.425 --> 31:35.394
Oh, my God.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.396
It's for you.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.432
(crackling)

31:40.466 --> 31:41.900
Whoa, dude!

31:49.075 --> 31:51.177
LYLE:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:51.210 --> 31:53.145
Don't you...!
GIBBS: Take the back.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.314
(stun gun crackling,
Lyle groaning)

31:57.716 --> 31:59.551
NCIS!

31:59.585 --> 32:01.353
(groaning)

32:01.387 --> 32:05.424
He just...
Taj-- he zapped me.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.193
Where is he?
He's up there.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.262
I can taste
my own blood.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.365
(groaning continues)

32:22.374 --> 32:24.243
(glass clatters)

32:29.481 --> 32:30.616
NCI...

32:30.649 --> 32:32.351
* Ooh, baby

32:32.384 --> 32:33.385
Oh, geez.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.620
Gibbs.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.255
Uh,

32:36.288 --> 32:37.990
forgive me for not getting up.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.326
Trust me, he's already up.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.161
* Ooh, baby...

32:43.395 --> 32:44.696
(grunts)

32:47.366 --> 32:48.534
(panting)

32:50.069 --> 32:51.703
(grunts)
Ow. Ooh.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.707
(panting)

32:59.811 --> 33:01.547
(engine starting)

33:02.514 --> 33:04.116
Get out.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.131
(chuckles softly)

33:19.165 --> 33:21.133
Man, would you quit messing
with my phone?

33:21.167 --> 33:23.335
What are you even
looking at anyway?
What I'm looking at,

33:23.369 --> 33:25.437
Taj, is a program
that shows the status

33:25.471 --> 33:29.508
of every alarm you've installed
from Virginia to... Delaware

33:29.541 --> 33:31.510
to Maryland.
(chuckles)

33:31.543 --> 33:34.446
So? That's
company software.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.348
Which you use
to rob houses.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.084
Rob what, now?

33:38.117 --> 33:40.752
I install alarms, bro.
Well, the pay

33:40.786 --> 33:42.088
must be great...

33:42.121 --> 33:44.790
bro, with that fancy-ass
Rolex of yours.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.659
It was a gift.
Oh, I see.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.361
Was it "gifted" to you

33:49.395 --> 33:50.762
by a family in Annapolis?

33:50.796 --> 33:53.332
While they were out
at the movies last week?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.267
What happened
with Maya Kettering?

33:55.301 --> 33:57.236
Stumble upon
your latest burglary spree?

33:57.269 --> 33:58.770
Kettering?

33:58.804 --> 34:01.540
Is that the chick
that was killed at the house?

34:02.574 --> 34:05.077
Whoa. What is this?

34:05.111 --> 34:08.114
Sure, maybe I find stuff on
my jobs. I-I didn't kill anyone.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.216
Where were you three days ago?
Come on, bro.
I don't even remember

34:10.249 --> 34:11.750
three minutes ago.
Well, try.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.285
Your life may depend on it.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.653
(exhales)

34:16.522 --> 34:19.391
(snaps fingers)
I was working a job
down in Wilmington.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.793
Your boss says
you had the day off.
It was an off-the-books job.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.095
Do you have proof?

34:23.129 --> 34:24.563
Hell, yeah.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.698
Check this out. Ha!

34:26.732 --> 34:29.635
That's a $200 belt right there.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.371
I paid nothing
for it. Ha!

34:32.404 --> 34:34.673
Who's the fool now?

34:34.706 --> 34:35.774
Still you, Taj.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.113
Oh, lame.

34:41.147 --> 34:44.183
That is the ugliest alibi
I've ever seen.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.484
Stolen with other
items from a house

34:45.517 --> 34:47.253
in Delaware
at the same time that

34:47.286 --> 34:48.887
Petty Officer Kettering
was killed.
Well,

34:48.920 --> 34:50.489
we can also rule out
the fiancée,

34:50.522 --> 34:51.723
Darlene Jones.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.125
Six witnesses confirmed
she was working

34:53.159 --> 34:55.627
at the hospital
the day of the murder.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.164
Back to square one.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.165
Mm-hmm.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.339
Still one suspect left.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.208
Who?

35:13.512 --> 35:14.846
(blowing)

35:21.487 --> 35:22.654
(sighs)

35:22.688 --> 35:25.691
Okay, Agent Gibbs,
you called and I came.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.493
Yeah. You made good time.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.695
My motel's not very far.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.332
Look, I'm not really in the mood

35:33.365 --> 35:34.866
for talking, so...
Yeah,

35:34.900 --> 35:37.603
that's fine by me.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.840
Thank you.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.576
Is the investigation over?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.478
Did you arrest Maya's killer?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.880
No. No, but we know who it is.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.849
Who?

35:52.484 --> 35:54.186
You.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.889
Is that some kind of joke?

35:57.923 --> 35:59.325
No.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.927
No joke; it's you.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.763
Wow.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.599
You must really...
hate me.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.301
'Cause I was on a plane

36:09.335 --> 36:11.270
when Maya was killed,
and you know that.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.807
Don't know anything yet.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.512
So I get my keys? No cuffs?

36:20.546 --> 36:22.614
Oh, you'll get those, too,
as soon as we figure out

36:22.648 --> 36:24.416
how you managed
to be two places at once.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.321
Well, good luck with that,
because it didn't happen.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.989
You know
what did happen?

36:31.022 --> 36:34.293
(quietly): I think you
got Darlene pregnant.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.296
Oops.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.599
Then you flew to Spain
to talk to your wife,

36:40.632 --> 36:43.935
ask her for a divorce, only...
Maya was a good Catholic,

36:43.969 --> 36:46.572
and she wanted
to work things out.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.006
But you didn't have
that kind of time,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.309
so you went to plan B.
Go to hell.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.480
I'll save you a seat.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.984
(phone rings)

36:59.017 --> 37:00.552
(phone beeps)

37:00.586 --> 37:02.288
Yeah. Gibbs.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.022
Gibbs.
Hey, Chief.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.891
You okay?
Well...

37:05.924 --> 37:08.460
I'm exhausted and I'm sore.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.562
I thought we agreed
never to speak of that.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.298
Yeah, we did. I'm, uh,

37:12.331 --> 37:13.965
calling you about our case.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.435
Oh. That sounds good,
doesn't it?

37:16.468 --> 37:18.304
(chuckles)
"Our case"?

37:18.337 --> 37:21.573
Hey, did you ever smoke
Cuban cigars?

37:21.607 --> 37:24.376
I've been looking
at Kettering's airport videos.

37:24.410 --> 37:27.479
Yeah?
It reminds me
of when I used to smuggle

37:27.513 --> 37:29.715
Cuban cigars into the country.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.584
I'd go to the duty-free
at Heathrow

37:32.618 --> 37:35.654
and buy a box, and then
I'd switch out the Cuban labels

37:35.687 --> 37:37.956
for the Nicaraguan labels.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.359
And Customs never caught on.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.460
I'm not following.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.462
I did it in the men's room.

37:43.495 --> 37:46.498
That's the only place they
don't have security cameras.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.268
JUDITH:
Round three, cowboy.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.038
Gibbs...

37:53.071 --> 37:55.907
got to go.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.683
Boss. Senior was
onto something.
Take a look at this.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.453
You remember
the security footage
from San Francisco Airport?

38:07.486 --> 38:10.389
All right, so Kettering
goes into the bathroom,

38:10.422 --> 38:12.691
and 15 seconds later, boom,

38:12.724 --> 38:14.693
this guy with a camo jacket
walks in.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.962
Now, they both spend exactly
four minutes inside.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.631
Nine hours later,
Dulles Airport, D.C.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.033
Kettering goes to use the
bathroom there as well.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.002
And check this out.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.037
Ten seconds later,
it's Mr. Camo Jacket.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.839
The same hat,
the same duffel,

38:27.873 --> 38:30.108
the same guy-- 2,500 miles away.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.777
They on the same flights?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.545
We checked. No.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.783
They switched places.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.785
Exactly.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.797
So, who is he?

38:51.830 --> 38:52.964
Your alibi.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.934
Story time, Kettering.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.504
Listen up.
You found a stranger--

38:58.537 --> 39:01.373
that guy-- who's about
your height and weight,

39:01.407 --> 39:04.576
you paid cash for his ticket
from San Francisco to D.C.,

39:04.610 --> 39:07.846
same day and time
as your flight.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.848
Only difference is
his flight was nonstop,

39:09.881 --> 39:11.850
while you had a layover
in Chicago.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.388
After you clear security,

39:16.422 --> 39:17.856
no one checks
your I.D. again,

39:17.889 --> 39:19.725
so you met
in the terminal bathroom.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.961
You swapped clothes
and boarding passes.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.098
And when you came out...

39:28.734 --> 39:31.737
...he was you,
and you were him.

39:38.644 --> 39:41.680
(chuckles):
What, are you nuts?
GIBBS: Don't interrupt.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.081
She's not done yet.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.750
He took your flight
with the layover

39:44.783 --> 39:47.953
in Chicago,
while you took his nonstop

39:47.986 --> 39:49.555
that landed in D.C.

39:49.588 --> 39:50.989
three hours earlier.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.558
Just enough time...

39:52.591 --> 39:54.426
for you to drive home,

39:54.460 --> 39:55.994
kill your wife,

39:56.027 --> 39:58.029
toss your house
and then get back

39:58.063 --> 40:00.031
to the Dulles Airport
just as your

40:00.065 --> 40:02.634
connecting flight landed.
QUINN: You met back up

40:02.668 --> 40:04.002
with your friend

40:04.035 --> 40:06.772
in the airport bathroom again,
swapped clothes,

40:06.805 --> 40:09.908
and paid him the five grand
missing from your freezer.

40:11.643 --> 40:15.481
Yeah. That's a good story.
Where's the proof?

40:15.514 --> 40:19.651
Well, we tracked your
camo-vested new best buddy,

40:19.685 --> 40:22.754
and he is writing
a full confession right now.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.166
I'm a man of my word.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.668
(trembling breath)

40:38.970 --> 40:42.874
No, th-this... this is crazy.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.075
What is he
even doing here?

40:44.109 --> 40:45.677
He was supposed
to fly to Mexico

40:45.711 --> 40:47.078
and then stay there.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.686
All I wanted was Darlene...

40:56.888 --> 40:59.457
...and our new baby.

41:01.727 --> 41:04.496
It was a perfect plan.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.199
Torres, we're good.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.139
It's only perfect
if you get away with it.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.713
Wait, that's not him.

41:24.783 --> 41:25.784
You set me up?

41:26.785 --> 41:27.819
Yeah, well,

41:27.853 --> 41:29.721
I'm no saint, either.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.557
(handcuffs clicking)

41:36.261 --> 41:38.564
...and as consulting detective,

41:38.597 --> 41:40.566
I hereby anoint thee

41:40.599 --> 41:42.801
Anthony DiNozzo Sr.,

41:42.834 --> 41:44.670
a full-fledged member

41:44.703 --> 41:48.206
of the Sherlock Consortium
for Investigation.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.240
(chuckles)

41:49.274 --> 41:52.243
Thank you.
Thanks very much.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.915
Thanks for coming, Gibbs.
Oh, I wouldn't
have missed it.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.316
I'm not a probie anymore.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.251
I don't take orders
from anyone.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.587
JUDITH:
Anthony.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.822
Beverages.
Let's go.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.725
Except her.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.126
I like that.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.328
You look happy, Chief.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.731
I am happy.

42:12.764 --> 42:15.601
SENIOR: New friends,
new title, new lady.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.869
Judith is taking me
to Paris tomorrow.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.938
I'm going to introduce her
to my family.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.140
(chuckles softly)
It's almost...

42:22.173 --> 42:24.576
like I don't deserve
all of this.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.913
No one deserves it more.
