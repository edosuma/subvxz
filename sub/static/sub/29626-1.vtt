WEBVTT

02:11.041 --> 02:12.875
It's crazy!
What do you want me to say?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.000
I'm trying here, Jo!

02:14.083 --> 02:15.803
Just...
You tell me what you need me to say.

02:15.833 --> 02:18.375
The fact that you don't know what to say,
that's the problem.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.000
You know what it is?
They just never liked me.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.708
No, that's not true.

02:22.791 --> 02:25.601
Really, 'cause your Dad's sitting there
offering me wine as if he didn't know.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.184
And your Mom's just sittin'
on the other side of the table

02:27.208 --> 02:28.041
shootin' me dirty looks.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.351
Maybe she was upset
because the turkey was getting cold, Ray.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.559
What do I got to do with the turkey?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.142
It took so long for you to get us there.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.017
I was driving 55.
I drove the speed limit.

02:35.041 --> 02:36.916
Is that the problem, Jo?
I am a safe driver.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.625
Okay.

02:42.916 --> 02:44.500
Look, why don't we just go home

02:45.166 --> 02:47.041
and do Thanksgiving all over again,
all right?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.833
Just the three of us. Our way.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.833
We could get pizza. Peri loves pizza.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.541
And then we can be thankful
for each other.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.916
Yeah?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.208
We need to stop kidding ourselves, Ray.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.958
We're just...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
...broken.

03:10.708 --> 03:12.541
We have been for a long time.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.583
I don't know why you would say that.

03:15.666 --> 03:16.958
I would talk to you about it

03:17.041 --> 03:18.641
if we ever actually talked,
but we don't.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.625
That's not fair.

03:21.916 --> 03:25.000
I work,
and sometimes I just like to... think.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.750
But you don't fight for anything anymore.
You used to.

03:28.916 --> 03:29.916
What about us?

03:30.708 --> 03:32.000
Who do you want me to be?

03:32.375 --> 03:34.833
I want you to be yourself.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.226
The guy that I married six years ago.

03:38.250 --> 03:43.291
The guy that I used to laugh with
and... and... and dream with and...

03:43.375 --> 03:44.541
I'm still that guy, Jo.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.375
I'm in a patch, and I admit it,

03:49.458 --> 03:50.916
but I love you, okay?

03:51.708 --> 03:53.416
And maybe I should just say it more often,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.083
'cause I love you...

03:56.916 --> 03:58.125
Ray!

04:05.875 --> 04:06.916
Jesus.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.500
- It's not working.
- Okay.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.958
It broke, Mommy, and the songs won't play.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.583
Let me see it, baby.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.333
Probably the batteries.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.708
Right, Daddy?

04:25.291 --> 04:27.000
Yeah. Probably the batteries.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.000
You brought extras, right? I told you.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.750
I left them on the... the counter.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.041
Daddy will get you some more batteries,
all right, sweetie?

04:35.166 --> 04:36.500
Hey, I have an idea.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.291
Let's play I Spy.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.125
- Blech.
- Blech?

04:42.208 --> 04:44.408
- What do you mean, "blech"?
- Why don't we sing a song?

04:44.458 --> 04:46.851
- Let's start with one obvious one.
- Let's sing a song.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.416
- "Shake It Off."
- I Spy...

04:48.500 --> 04:52.250
Hm. That's a good one too,
but I'm thinking more "Sing a Rainbow."

04:52.750 --> 04:53.583
Okay.

04:53.666 --> 04:55.684
- Maybe it's gotten a little babyish, Ray.
- One,

04:55.708 --> 04:58.041
two... <i>♪ Red and yellow ♪</i>

04:58.125 --> 05:01.000

05:32.166 --> 05:33.166
Daddy?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.291
Yeah?

05:34.458 --> 05:36.041
I gotta go potty.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
What, right now?

05:38.291 --> 05:40.041
- I gotta go.
- Can you hold it?

05:40.583 --> 05:41.416
No.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.166
Okay, I'll pull over
at the next rest stop, and then we'll...

05:44.791 --> 05:46.750
tinkle. Okay?

05:46.833 --> 05:49.333
Maybe they'll have batteries.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.416
Mommy, come on! I have to go!

06:13.875 --> 06:14.875
All right, baby.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.250
Lean forward.

06:17.916 --> 06:20.583
Remember, we don't touch anything
that we don't have to in there.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.541
Can you get me a Coke, please?

06:24.625 --> 06:26.666
- Yeah.
- I don't know why, but I'm parched.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.541
And can I get a four-pack
of AA batteries, please?

07:21.250 --> 07:22.791
And two of these, please.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.291
Okay.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.375
No plastic.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.125
Okay, just... just the coffee
and the Coke and the...

07:49.708 --> 07:50.708
Thank you.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.083
Did you get batteries?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.083
They didn't have any.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.416
Mommy, my compact! Where is it?

08:00.791 --> 08:02.391
I don't know,
why are you asking me, Per?

08:02.541 --> 08:04.166
Because it's gone!

08:04.250 --> 08:06.142
What... Did you check
on the seat under your bum?

08:06.166 --> 08:07.226
Yes, it's not there.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.583
- I had it in the ladies' room, remember?
- You check your pocket?

08:12.083 --> 08:13.750
In the ladies' room?

08:14.916 --> 08:16.196
Okay. Well, I will go check

08:16.250 --> 08:18.250
in the ladies' room.
But if I find it in there,

08:18.333 --> 08:20.293
you don't get to touch it
until we get home, okay?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.333
Okay.

08:26.541 --> 08:28.261
Will you check in the back,
under the seats?

08:29.083 --> 08:30.083
Yeah.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.000
Daddy, check the seats.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.375
Come on.

08:41.582 --> 08:43.791
Up, up, up.
Here we go. I got ya.

08:43.916 --> 08:47.958
All right.
Right, just stay right there.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.333
Peri, where is the...
It's a pigsty back here.

08:51.416 --> 08:53.125
Where am I even meant to begin,
you know?

08:53.208 --> 08:55.833
God damn it!

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Daddy.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.833
I just...

09:03.375 --> 09:07.291
This shi...
This is gonna stain. You know?

09:09.041 --> 09:12.375
What if I wanted to resell this car?
Can't even do that.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.958
I guess this is just the cherry
on the cake, this is.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.063
Come on...

09:54.833 --> 09:56.916
Peri, there's no sign of the thing.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.291
Daddy.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.583
Daddy!

10:05.333 --> 10:07.416
- Daddy!
- What? What?

10:11.541 --> 10:12.541
Peri, don't move.

10:13.625 --> 10:15.585
All right, don't be scared.
Just stay right there.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.458
Hey! Dog! Go on!

10:18.041 --> 10:19.041
Hey! Go on.

10:19.833 --> 10:23.083
Go on. Go on, move.
No, no, Peri, not you. J-Just stay there.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.166
Peri, don't move.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.791
Don't move. Don't move, okay?

10:25.875 --> 10:26.875
Go on!

10:26.916 --> 10:27.916
Go on, get!

10:28.666 --> 10:29.666
Don't move.

10:29.916 --> 10:30.916
Peri, stop.

10:33.875 --> 10:34.791
Don't move.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.226
It's gonna be okay.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.333
I'm just gonna scare him.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.125
No!

10:46.083 --> 10:47.541
No!

10:55.250 --> 10:57.708
<i>Sorry, Mr. Monroe. She's gone.</i>

10:59.041 --> 11:02.000
<i>They're both gone.</i>

11:17.458 --> 11:18.708
Ray?

11:29.208 --> 11:32.041
Uh, Ray? Ray?

11:32.541 --> 11:34.166
Ray? Ray!

11:34.500 --> 11:39.291
Ray! Ray! Ray!
Ray! Ray!

11:46.708 --> 11:49.833
Ray! Ray!

11:55.958 --> 11:58.375
My baby!

12:11.500 --> 12:15.000
Ray! Ray!

12:28.208 --> 12:29.208
Daddy.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.291
Peri? Baby? Baby?

12:32.166 --> 12:34.541
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Baby?

12:34.625 --> 12:36.541
Baby? Baby?

12:36.625 --> 12:40.500
- Joanne, don't move her.
- She's okay. She's okay. She's okay.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.500
Put her down.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.375
She's okay. She's okay.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.333
There you go.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.458
I'm right here. I'm right here.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.333
You hurt?

12:48.750 --> 12:50.333
I don't think so.

12:51.208 --> 12:54.166
Okay. Well, there doesn't seem to be
any scratches or bruises.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.000
Ray, she needs a doctor.

12:56.958 --> 12:57.958
I know what I'm doin'.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.333
- Ray...
- I'm gonna pick you up, all right?

13:00.416 --> 13:02.517
- Ow!
- Hold on. What is it? What is it?

13:02.541 --> 13:04.958
- My arm, Daddy. It hurts.
- This arm?

13:05.166 --> 13:06.375
I think it's broken.

13:07.750 --> 13:08.750
Let's try again.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.291
Nice and slow.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.041
Don't hurt me, Daddy.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.916
I would never hurt you, sweetie.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.500
I would never hurt you.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.541
Gentle, Daddy.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.666
- Gentle, Ray.
- Okay. It's all right. Up we go.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.833
Here we go.
Daddy's got you.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.875
Here we go. Yeah, here we go.
Here we are.

13:33.666 --> 13:34.786
Here we go.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.166
Shh. It's okay.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.583
I'm calling 911.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.306
- Don't bother. I'll drive.
- Ray...

13:40.000 --> 13:42.041
I saw a hospital sign a few miles back.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.765
By the time that ambulance gets here,
we'd have gotten her to help.

13:44.833 --> 13:45.708
Are you sure?

13:45.791 --> 13:47.833
Joanne, I got this.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.476
We're gonna stay awake
until we get to the hospital.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.750
Daddy's gonna get us there
real fast. Okay?

14:07.833 --> 14:08.916
Move.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.166
Hurry, Ray, hurry.

14:13.708 --> 14:14.583
Nearly there.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.791
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.083
Oh!

14:24.166 --> 14:26.291
Ray. Hurry.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.041
Ray?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.250
Ray.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.083
Ray!

14:46.208 --> 14:47.250
Okay.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.333
There it is! There it is. There it is.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.250
Okay. Daddy's got us.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.583
- Almost there.
- We're there.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.000
All right, right.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.333
I'll go get a wheelchair.

15:06.666 --> 15:09.083
Nah, I'm gonna carry her. Okay, sweetie.

15:09.583 --> 15:12.333
I'll go get us checked in. All right?
I won't be long, sweetie.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.125
Okay.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.017
We've been waiting for hours.
What's taking so long?

15:31.041 --> 15:32.166
I understand.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.684
- He's in pain.
- I apologize.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.083
I'm gonna find someone
for you here, right...

15:37.375 --> 15:39.000
Ray.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.083
This is gonna take a sec.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.085
You should take a seat,
make her more comfortable.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.708
She's really hurting.

15:44.791 --> 15:46.791
I know. I'll take care of it.

15:47.916 --> 15:49.541
Okay.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.934
So it doesn't matter
that the address has changed,

15:54.958 --> 15:57.250
That's okay? All right.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.875
Excuse me. I need a doctor.
There's been an accident.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.934
- Do you mind?
- Take a seat. We'll be with you shortly.

16:01.958 --> 16:03.267
- Hang on, it's my daughter.
- No!

16:03.291 --> 16:05.226
- We think she broke her arm.
- Sir, take a seat, and I assure you...

16:05.250 --> 16:06.809
- She's in a lot of pain!
- ...we'll get you checked in

16:06.833 --> 16:08.166
as soon as possible.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.000
- Take a seat.
- I just need to see someone.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.333
Enough. Sit down.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.625
Wait your turn. Please.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.041
I'm sure it won't be long.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.583
I heard her, Ray.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.541
Mm-hmm. Just stay calm.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.458
I'll be calm
when a doctor sees our daughter.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.750
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.666
Daddy's gonna take care of us.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.166
What do you want me to do?
You want me to kick down the doors

16:38.250 --> 16:40.708
- and drag a doctor out here?
- Yes.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.750
That I'd like to see.

16:44.625 --> 16:45.625
Do something.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.666
Do something, Ray.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.290
Sir?

17:17.915 --> 17:19.500
How can I help you, sir?

17:19.583 --> 17:21.708
Yeah, I really need to see that doctor,
right now.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.833
I understand.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.915
But as I told you before, sir,
there are other patients ahead of you.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.125
Can you just squeeze us in?

17:27.208 --> 17:28.726
She's sick.
She doesn't know what's going on.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.708
- Did you sign in?
- What?

17:30.791 --> 17:32.833
It moves a lot faster if you sign in.

17:32.916 --> 17:34.750
Y-You told me to sit down.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.083
Mr. Fellows? Dale Fellows.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.606
Hi, Dale. How are you feeling today?

17:39.666 --> 17:41.500
He has a sharp pain in his stomach.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.708
Bit of paperwork first,
and we'll get him admitted.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.767
Would you happen to know
what Dale's blood type is?

17:45.791 --> 17:46.791
B positive.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.708
Another one.
Maybe 15 years old.

17:49.791 --> 17:50.791
B positive.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.000
Let Dr. Berthram know.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.093
<i>Dr. Berthram...
Dr. Berthram...</i>

17:58.166 --> 18:00.083
Please go back to your seat, sir.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.958
I'll let you know
when a doctor becomes available.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.500
- We're on the list now.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
She's sleeping.

18:11.583 --> 18:12.583
Okay.

18:15.708 --> 18:16.708
Here, hold this.

18:17.625 --> 18:19.666
It's so hot in here.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.625
I'm sorry.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.250
I didn't mean to...
bite your head off earlier.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.875
It's okay. Uh...

18:37.250 --> 18:38.333
We're gonna be fine.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.291
Thank you.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.250
For what?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.916
For getting us here so fast.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.291
I just did what needed to be done.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.541
- Well, you missed your calling.
- Yeah?

18:52.625 --> 18:53.875
Driving NASCAR.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.833
Ah, man, I missed that.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.291
Missed what?

19:04.166 --> 19:06.333
Just... laughing with you.

19:11.708 --> 19:12.916
Mm...

19:14.541 --> 19:15.541
You okay?

19:16.041 --> 19:17.458
My head is just...

19:18.208 --> 19:19.750
mm, like, throbbing.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.958
I mean, you're probably dehydrated.

19:23.625 --> 19:24.625
I can fix that.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.083
There you go.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.041
- Thank you.
<i>- Who are they?</i>

20:04.125 --> 20:07.666
<i>They are the ones who fight
and don't give up,</i>

20:07.750 --> 20:09.666
<i>keeping our families safe.</i>

20:09.750 --> 20:14.708
<i>Sons, husbands, fathers. Our heroes.</i>

20:14.791 --> 20:17.541
Monroe. Ray Monroe.

20:18.625 --> 20:19.458
Yeah, go on.

20:19.541 --> 20:22.166
Can I see
your driver's license and insurance card?

20:23.625 --> 20:25.958
- All this information is correct?
- Yeah.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.416
Your occupation?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.208
I work at Craft Home Improvement.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.833
He's the assistant manager

20:37.083 --> 20:39.291
for the kitchen
and bathroom design center.

20:41.791 --> 20:43.708
Has Peri had any prior surgeries?

20:43.791 --> 20:44.791
Allergies?

20:44.875 --> 20:48.875
Yes. She reacts to penicillin.
Her skin breaks out in a rash.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.875
Any history of mental illness
in the family?

20:52.291 --> 20:53.125
No.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.166
Drugs? Alcoholism?

20:56.583 --> 20:59.041
I'm a recovering alcoholic.
How long is this going to take?

20:59.958 --> 21:01.250
Just a couple of minutes.

21:03.791 --> 21:07.625
Your insurance records show
a prior dependent, Abby Monroe.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.916
My first wife is deceased.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.666
And this happened...?

21:11.750 --> 21:13.750
Eight years ago. Why is this relevant?

21:13.833 --> 21:17.333
There's just an overlap in your plan
that your PPO never fixed.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.958
Were you at the same employer then?

21:20.791 --> 21:24.041
No. I was self-employed and, um...

21:26.583 --> 21:28.458
- Listen...
- And you're married?

21:28.541 --> 21:30.291
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Of course, yeah.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.500
- How many years?
- Six.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.750
Honestly, how long is this gonna take?

21:36.833 --> 21:38.333
We're almost finished.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.875
Would you like Peri listed
for organ donation?

21:42.416 --> 21:43.416
No.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.000
Can I convince you to reconsider?

21:46.083 --> 21:48.083
The number of children
on the transplant list is...

21:48.166 --> 21:49.625
Not now, please.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.250
What is your daughter's blood type?

21:58.958 --> 22:00.333
Your blood types?

22:00.625 --> 22:02.125
O, I think.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.750
That's all right.
We can crossmatch later if necessary.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.434
- Why would that be necessary?
- Last one.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.916
The state requires me to ask
if everything is safe in the household.

22:11.916 --> 22:12.916
- Really?
- Ray...

22:13.583 --> 22:16.708
With these types of injuries, sir,
I am mandated by law.

22:16.791 --> 22:19.291
Okay, but this was an accident
at a construction site.

22:19.375 --> 22:22.041
Ray... Yes, we're safe.
Our household...

22:23.375 --> 22:24.750
- is safe.
- Mommy?

22:24.833 --> 22:26.500
All right, then. We're done.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.583
I'll get a nurse to take you back. Oh.

22:29.666 --> 22:30.916
My arm, it still hurts.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.184
- What?
- I know, sweetheart.

22:32.208 --> 22:35.375
Sir, it looks like we don't take
your type of medical insurance here.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.541
- Ray...
- I'm sorry.

22:37.625 --> 22:40.333
If you call your provider,
they can give you a list of qualified...

22:40.416 --> 22:42.176
A list? I don't need a list.
I need a doctor.

22:42.250 --> 22:45.291
This hospital's admission policy
requires proof of coverage.

22:45.375 --> 22:47.833
Whatever it takes, I'll cover it. Okay?

22:47.916 --> 22:50.041
You do take cash here?
You got an ATM?

22:50.125 --> 22:51.375
You take cash?

22:52.208 --> 22:53.666
I will have to check.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
Excuse me.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.083
This is insane.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.833
I can't believe this, can you?

23:05.916 --> 23:08.166
She's sitting there going...

23:08.250 --> 23:09.625
"Your shoe size?"

23:13.041 --> 23:14.041
Mommy?

23:16.166 --> 23:18.458
- He doesn't have...
- Did you find my compact?

23:18.541 --> 23:21.541
We didn't, sweetheart,
but I'm gonna buy you another one soon.

23:26.541 --> 23:28.083
Everything's fine, Mr. Monroe.

23:28.166 --> 23:29.446
- You're good to go.
- Fantastic.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.851
Nurse Anne will get you situated.

23:30.875 --> 23:31.875
Okay.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.416
- Hi, is this Peri?
- Yes.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.101
- We'll get you taken care of right away.
- Yes, another one.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.934
- Come on, baby.
- Sit in the wheelchair for me?

23:38.958 --> 23:42.500
A walk-in. Six-year-old female,
unknown blood type.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.583
Let Dr. Berthram know.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.708
Kirkbride serves three counties,
so it can get quite busy.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.671
And EMS just brought in
a couple of head traumas

23:50.708 --> 23:53.291
- so it's backed us up a bit.
- Yeah, I saw that. What happened?

23:53.375 --> 23:57.125
A couple of teenagers. Head-on collision.
It was a drunk driver.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.208
That's horrible. They all right?

24:00.708 --> 24:02.468
As I understand it,
it's touch-and-go.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.517
Do you have to do that?

24:06.541 --> 24:07.541
He's in a lot of pain.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.708
I just need to know
where he's hurting, okay?

24:10.791 --> 24:13.583
Okay, sweetheart.
There you are. Okay.

24:14.375 --> 24:15.625
Doctor will be right in.

24:15.708 --> 24:18.541
Hey, baby.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.985
Hey, just keep that arm in your lap,
lay back on the pillow.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.750
- Won't be long.
- Better not be...

24:24.333 --> 24:26.333
or I'm gonna break somebody's arm.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.833
Not mine, I hope.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.416
Hi. I'm Dr. Berthram.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.333
Hi.

24:31.416 --> 24:33.041
- You must be...
- Peri.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.916
- Peri.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.375
No, no, no, it's quite all right.

24:36.625 --> 24:40.458
Sometimes I've gotta crack
a few heads myself around here

24:40.541 --> 24:42.291
to get anything done.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.625
So, Perry Mason,

24:45.166 --> 24:46.375
what can we do for ya?

24:46.458 --> 24:48.708
Monroe. Peri Monroe.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.208
Oh! Yes. I see it now.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.208
Yes. Peri. And that's P-E-R-I?

24:54.291 --> 24:56.250
It's short for Periwinkle.

24:56.333 --> 24:57.500
Isn't that sweet?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.375
It's my mommy's favorite shell.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.625
Okay, sweetheart.
Let's let the nice doctor do his job.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.583
It's all right, I'm not that nice.

25:04.958 --> 25:05.958
So...

25:06.875 --> 25:08.666
what's the story, young lady?

25:09.125 --> 25:10.125
I fell.

25:10.458 --> 25:12.166
Oh, dear. Yeah.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.541
Well, sooner or later, everybody does.

25:15.416 --> 25:16.416
Right, Dad?

25:17.791 --> 25:20.375
So, Peri,
I'm gonna see how that arm is doing,

25:20.458 --> 25:21.875
and if anything hurts,

25:22.291 --> 25:23.291
anything at all,

25:23.375 --> 25:25.625
I want you to let me know. Deal?

25:25.708 --> 25:27.333
- Deal.
- Okay.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.333
Where did this happen?

25:29.916 --> 25:34.000
- It's a gas station a few miles from here.
- We're on our way to Minneapolis.

25:34.250 --> 25:37.708
Visiting Grandma and Grandpa
for Thanksgiving, I bet.

25:37.791 --> 25:39.750
Uh-huh.

25:40.208 --> 25:43.291
- All right, so you were at a gas station?
- Yup.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.041
Yeah, off Route 20.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.791
I know. I'm sorry.

25:47.875 --> 25:50.083
Uh, there was a dog, and it scared her.

25:50.166 --> 25:51.000
A dog?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.708
Uh, it was just an accident.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.333
You didn't say anything about a dog.

25:55.416 --> 25:56.976
Did that hurt when I touched here?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.625
- Yeah, I know, sweetie. That's an ouchie.
- Uh, it doesn't matter, she just fell.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.791
And I nearly had you, didn't I?

26:02.875 --> 26:04.833
So, sweetheart, when you fell,

26:05.166 --> 26:07.791
did you hit your head, Peri? You did?

26:08.583 --> 26:11.166
You know, you are a real trooper.

26:11.541 --> 26:12.583
You think it's broken?

26:12.666 --> 26:16.333
I think the swelling is consistent
with a fracture along the distal radius,

26:16.416 --> 26:18.833
but we'll get an...
we'll get an X-ray to confirm that.

26:18.916 --> 26:21.036
- She need a cast?
- We're going to put her in...

26:21.083 --> 26:24.059
You're a brave girl. Yeah.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.000
I don't think
they're gonna have to amputate.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.809
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you one thing.

26:27.833 --> 26:28.958
In a few weeks,

26:29.541 --> 26:33.583
this arm is gonna be as good as new.

26:33.666 --> 26:36.125
Now, look at my shoulder.
Peri, look at my shoulder.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.500
That's right. My shoulder.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.833
That's right. Uh-huh.

26:41.291 --> 26:43.333
Most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

26:44.916 --> 26:48.458
Now, Peri, Nurse Anne is gonna come
and give you some medicine for the pain.

26:48.541 --> 26:51.166
I gotta talk to Mommy and Daddy here
for a minute.

26:51.250 --> 26:55.375
Um... ibuprofen. Check vitals please.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.416
Uh, this way, guys.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.083
Okay, baby.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.333
<i>I'm concerned
about a possible head injury.</i>

27:02.708 --> 27:04.041
There's no reason for alarm.

27:04.125 --> 27:07.958
It's just I'm not seeing
the pupil dilation that I like.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.875
Since you're traveling,

27:09.958 --> 27:13.458
I'd like to do a CAT scan
just to rule out anything internal.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.166
But she seems fine.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.666
And I would agree with you,

27:16.750 --> 27:19.750
but on the off chance
that it's bleeding around the brain,

27:19.833 --> 27:22.000
what we would call a subdural hematoma,

27:22.583 --> 27:24.666
now that can be quite serious.

27:25.250 --> 27:29.458
A head injury like that could lead
to confusion, seizures,

27:29.916 --> 27:32.375
even the possibility of slipping
into a coma.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.458
We've... We've heard enough. Do it.

27:34.541 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, but you need to know...
it is a costly procedure.

27:38.083 --> 27:41.625
I would do anything for my family,
so you do what you have to do.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.791
Make sure she's okay.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.375
That's a wise choice.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.541
You know, that's a pretty nasty
little scrape you have yourself.

27:51.458 --> 27:54.166
- Should I take a look?
- It's nothin'. I'm a tough guy.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.958
Okay, well, give me a minute
to get things in motion for Peri.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.125
Yeah.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.458
She's all right, isn't she?

28:08.083 --> 28:10.125
Yeah. Yeah, you heard him.
It's nothing.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.583
It's just a precaution.
It's better to be safe, right?

28:14.375 --> 28:15.375
We'll be fine.

28:18.083 --> 28:19.208
We will, Ray.

28:20.708 --> 28:23.083
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

28:23.166 --> 28:25.708
Wow. Look... look at that.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.875
This goes over your head
right here.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.250
You're being so brave.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.017
We're almost done,
and we get to go home soon.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.541
He's going down to the lower level
for an appendectomy.

28:33.958 --> 28:36.416
It looks like you're feeling better.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.541
Hey, maybe we should get a motel
like the old days

28:42.625 --> 28:44.083
and pick up the drive tomorrow.

28:46.833 --> 28:49.041
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

28:49.875 --> 28:51.166
My head is killing me.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.125
Maybe they have a hot tub.

28:55.375 --> 28:58.875
Hello, Peri.
Nurse Anne and I got this for you

28:58.958 --> 29:01.041
for being the number one patient
of the day.

29:01.125 --> 29:04.375
Oh! Ah, look at that. Thank you.
That's so sweet.

29:04.458 --> 29:05.375
No problem.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.875
- <i>I hope you feel better.</i>
- I'm Bruce.

29:08.416 --> 29:09.736
And I'm gonna take you downstairs

29:09.791 --> 29:12.552
so we can take a little peek
inside that little noggin of yours. Okay?

29:12.833 --> 29:14.208
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:14.708 --> 29:17.958
You know, you must have made
quite an impression on Dr. Berthram.

29:18.041 --> 29:20.333
He does not crack a smile
for just anybody.

29:20.416 --> 29:22.000
Yeah, she's a real charmer.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.041
Dad here must have to keep a shotgun handy

29:24.125 --> 29:26.291
to chase off all the boys, am I right?

29:28.916 --> 29:31.625
All right, keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle.

29:35.583 --> 29:36.666
Mm-hmm.

29:39.791 --> 29:42.958
So, this is a...
a more restricted part of the hospital.

29:43.041 --> 29:46.333
I can only take one visitor down
with a patient to the lower level.

29:46.416 --> 29:47.541
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

29:47.875 --> 29:48.875
Hey, you go.

29:50.333 --> 29:51.333
You sure?

29:51.708 --> 29:52.708
Yeah, I'll be fine.

29:53.916 --> 29:54.916
Okay.

29:56.250 --> 29:59.916
Hey. I'm gonna wait right here for you
when you get out.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.041
Actually, you might want to wait
out front.

30:02.125 --> 30:04.750
Yeah, scans can take a while,
especially if they're backed up.

30:05.416 --> 30:06.416
Okay, then.

30:08.291 --> 30:09.708
I'll book that motel.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.416
Daddy, can I have a pizza?

30:13.500 --> 30:14.333
Yeah.

30:14.416 --> 30:17.166
- With extra cheese.
- Extra cheese.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.250
Yeah.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.291
I love you, Daddy.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.041
I love you, sweetheart.

30:25.583 --> 30:26.833
You did good.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.958
Okay. Okay, okay. We'll see you in a few.

30:32.041 --> 30:33.041
Yeah.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.583
Yeah.

30:39.166 --> 30:40.666
Next year, we fly.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.041
How about next year, we stay home?

31:29.166 --> 31:30.708
<i>Daddy!</i>

31:37.250 --> 31:39.666
Next time, we fly.

31:44.166 --> 31:45.708
Hey, buddy, you all right?

31:55.791 --> 31:57.208
You were talkin' in your sleep.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.642
<i>Well, suppose somebody came along</i>

31:58.666 --> 32:00.546
<i>and offered you
a million dollars for your life.</i>

32:00.583 --> 32:03.833
<i>Would you take it?
John, don't even talk like that.</i>

32:04.833 --> 32:07.250
<i>Do you mean I'll be... dead?</i>

32:07.500 --> 32:08.583
No, I'm fine.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.583
<i>Well, not me.</i>

32:10.666 --> 32:12.083
<i>I wouldn't take it.</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:16.541
<i>Your life is worth
more than a million dollars,</i>

32:16.625 --> 32:18.291
<i>so don't bet it on getting around</i>

32:18.375 --> 32:20.750
<i>in a car in order to save
a couple of minutes.</i>

32:22.041 --> 32:23.333
<i>The gamble isn't worth it.</i>

32:23.416 --> 32:26.166
<i>The stakes are too high
for what you can possibly get out of it.</i>

32:44.625 --> 32:47.875
- It still hurts.
- Excuse me.

32:47.958 --> 32:50.601
I think my baby has an infection
or something. He won't stop crying.

32:50.625 --> 32:52.392
Okay, how long has that been going on for?

32:52.416 --> 32:53.708
A couple of days.

32:53.791 --> 32:56.916
Okay, um, well,
I'm gonna get you to sign this form.

33:26.208 --> 33:28.291
If you'll just take a seat, sir.
Thank you.

33:31.458 --> 33:32.625
How may I help you?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.916
Do you know how much longer it's gonna be?

33:35.541 --> 33:37.791
Sir, I'm gonna need
a little more information than that.

33:38.916 --> 33:42.041
My daughter, Peri Monroe,
she went for a CAT scan with my wife.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.767
Okay,
so she checked in before?

33:43.791 --> 33:44.625
Yeah.

33:44.708 --> 33:46.875
All right, morning shift
would have taken care of that.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.226
I don't have the imaging schedule,
but it can take a little while.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.625
Yeah. They told me that, I just...

33:52.458 --> 33:54.458
You know, I know my kid.
She's gonna be hungry

33:54.541 --> 33:55.875
I just wanna check on her.

33:55.958 --> 33:58.416
As I said, sir,
I don't have that information here.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.500
It's been hours.

33:59.541 --> 34:01.901
And if you just take a seat,
I'm sure she'll be out shortly.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.541
<i>Cardiology, 54-12. Cardiology.</i>

34:09.375 --> 34:11.333
I'd like to speak with Dr. Berthram.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.708
Dr. Berthram has left for the day.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.000
But he was helping us.

34:18.083 --> 34:18.916
I understand,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.750
but he would have passed his cases
to the other doctor on duty.

34:21.833 --> 34:24.434
I can have the nurse's station
pass along a message to the on-duty,

34:24.458 --> 34:25.458
- All right?
- Yeah.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.625
If you'll just give me a moment.

34:35.583 --> 34:36.583
<i>- Oh, no!
- Truck!</i>

34:42.416 --> 34:46.125
<i>I lived it again and again,
like in slow motion...</i>

34:46.916 --> 34:48.416
<i>We're gonna hit it!</i>

35:08.583 --> 35:10.916
It's enough to drive you nuts, isn't it?

35:13.750 --> 35:14.750
Sorry?

35:15.208 --> 35:18.541
The wait.
I've seen you sitting over there.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.541
My husband went in at 6:00 a.m.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.583
Melanoma.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.250
Pretty simple procedure.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.184
Now it's almost dinnertime.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.000
Hurry up and wait.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.166
Hurry up and pay.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.333
Sometimes they hope
we all just die in the meantime.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.916
Uh, what are you in for?

35:39.291 --> 35:40.125
Nothing.

35:40.208 --> 35:41.892
<i>Call a doctor for Tommy.
Call an ambulance.</i>

35:41.916 --> 35:42.916
Excuse me.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.541
What's that? It's...

35:51.916 --> 35:53.250
Hi, how may I help you?

35:54.041 --> 35:55.041
My daughter?

35:55.791 --> 35:58.666
Oh, right, yes. I did leave word, sir,
but I haven't heard back yet.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.166
Can you check again now, please?

36:02.791 --> 36:04.041
Okay, what was her name again?

36:04.125 --> 36:05.250
Peri Monroe.

36:05.375 --> 36:06.916
Monroe. M-U-N?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.875
No, M-O-N-R-O-E.

36:09.291 --> 36:12.791
Okay, I have several Monroes here,
but I'm not seeing a Peri Monroe.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.392
Could she be under another name?

36:14.416 --> 36:16.625
I signed in.
I signed in on the clipboard, right?

36:16.708 --> 36:18.166
It's right... It's right here.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.434
Yeah,
but that gets thrown out

36:19.458 --> 36:21.434
at the end of each shift.
It would all be in the system by now,

36:21.458 --> 36:23.333
but I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe."

36:23.416 --> 36:25.250
That's crazy 'cause we were admitted.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.416
You know,
you asked us for all this information.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.976
Yes, but the patient's file
is always under the patient's name,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.184
and I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe."

36:31.208 --> 36:33.416
She is a patient.
She's a patient of Dr. Berthram's.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.767
- Yeah, he saw her.
- Dr. Berthram has left for the evening.

36:35.791 --> 36:37.231
Yeah, I know that! You told me that!

36:37.291 --> 36:39.458
Sir, there's no need...
to raise your voice.

36:43.791 --> 36:47.083
Check again. When we came in,
in late morning, we did all this,

36:47.166 --> 36:49.166
and then they took her down
to the CAT scan.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.333
Okay, maybe they put it
under your insurance number.

36:51.416 --> 36:52.291
Can I get your card?

36:52.375 --> 36:55.833
You wouldn't take my insurance.
You said that I could pay cash.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.625
- Cash?
- Yeah, all worked out.

36:57.708 --> 37:00.541
The woman who admitted us,
she asked. They said it was fine.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.267
I've just never heard it being done
that way before.

37:02.291 --> 37:05.500
Yeah, I don't care about that
because I don't make the rules. All right?

37:05.583 --> 37:07.791
Let's ask her.
Let's ask the woman that checked us in.

37:07.875 --> 37:08.750
She's already gone.

37:08.833 --> 37:10.541
Then let's ask the ER, all right?

37:10.625 --> 37:13.476
Because there was a nurse named Anne,
there was an orderly, his name was Bruce.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.851
There's been a full shift rotation.

37:14.875 --> 37:17.416
I just want to see my wife and daughter,
and they're back there.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.458
Unless I can identify you
with a patient, I...

37:23.375 --> 37:24.458
It's been a long day,

37:24.708 --> 37:26.934
and I just need you to call down
to where they do the CAT scans

37:26.958 --> 37:29.666
and see if there's a woman
and a six-year-old kid still there,

37:29.750 --> 37:32.166
and whether they're waiting,
or if they want to come home.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.833
Can you do that, please?

37:35.208 --> 37:36.666
You're... You're bleeding.

37:42.083 --> 37:43.541
Hi, this is the main desk.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.000
Oh, hi, Tim.

37:48.458 --> 37:51.125
You better stop,
or I'll make you live up to that.

37:53.208 --> 37:56.333
Um, anyway, I'm just calling
about a little girl.

37:56.416 --> 37:58.416
She came up for a scan.

37:58.583 --> 37:59.833
Late morning.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.583
I know, I know,
but can you check for me, please?

38:12.166 --> 38:13.500
You're bad.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.875
Bye.

38:17.333 --> 38:20.583
I'm sorry, sir, there hasn't been a scan
since nine o'clock this morning,

38:20.666 --> 38:22.833
and it was for a 62-year-old woman's hip.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.666
So what are you telling me?

38:26.791 --> 38:28.500
I'm sorry,
they're not here.

38:29.666 --> 38:31.833
What? What? You lost my family?

38:32.416 --> 38:33.816
Maybe you're at the wrong hospital.

38:33.875 --> 38:35.166
I've been sitting there all day.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.601
Maybe they left
before you got here.

38:36.625 --> 38:38.434
Why would they do that?
Why would they do that?

38:38.458 --> 38:40.809
- We came together.
- I'm sorry, sir. Sir! They're not here.

38:40.833 --> 38:41.851
Would you please excuse me

38:41.875 --> 38:43.309
so I can deal
with the gentleman behind you?

38:43.333 --> 38:46.416
- What are you saying?
- Hi, how may I help you?

38:47.208 --> 38:49.875
My wife's been sitting over there
for two hours.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.666
It's just going to be
a little bit longer.

39:00.041 --> 39:02.166
Uh, excuse me, sir!
You can't go back there!

39:02.250 --> 39:04.166
Drew, that man,
he shouldn't be back there.

39:04.250 --> 39:05.250
Call security.

39:32.458 --> 39:34.583
What the hell? Do you mind?

39:34.666 --> 39:36.746
- I'm so sorry, I'm just looking for...
- Hey!

39:36.958 --> 39:39.333
- You're not supposed to be back here.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

39:39.416 --> 39:41.136
- Hey! Hey!
- All right. Enough.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.392
- Drew, what's going on?
- This guy just rushed in from up front.

39:43.416 --> 39:46.096
Just... uh, my family's back here.
The receptionist, she wouldn't...

39:46.166 --> 39:47.833
I don't give a shit, pal. Just calm down.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.666
What is going on here?

39:50.833 --> 39:53.017
I'm just looking for my wife and daughter.
Joanne and Peri Monroe.

39:53.041 --> 39:54.333
Are they patients here?

39:55.083 --> 39:58.500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My daughter is.
That's what I'm trying to explain.

39:58.583 --> 40:01.416
All right, all right,
let's all just take it easy. Okay?

40:01.708 --> 40:03.541
I'm Dr. Lucado. And you?

40:03.625 --> 40:04.875
Me, I'm Ray Monroe.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.208
Okay, Ray...

40:07.250 --> 40:09.916
why don't you tell me
what all this fuss is about.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.291
Well, we came in earlier,
and my daughter saw Dr. Berthram, he...

40:13.541 --> 40:16.541
- She had a potentially fractured arm.
- Okay, was she released?

40:16.791 --> 40:19.833
No, no, no. She...
He was worried about a head injury.

40:19.916 --> 40:21.684
He took her to the CAT scan.
Joanne went with her.

40:21.708 --> 40:23.601
- That's the last time I saw her.
- This was when?

40:23.625 --> 40:26.250
Hours ago.

40:27.416 --> 40:31.125
- Monroe?
- M... M-O-N-R-O-E.

40:34.375 --> 40:35.375
What a day, huh?

40:44.333 --> 40:48.166
Got the whole day in front of me here,
and I'm not finding any Monroe.

40:52.333 --> 40:55.291
Well, that's insane 'cause, you know,
we were here.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.833
We were right... right there.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.833
- All right...
- So was she. So was she.

41:01.916 --> 41:05.166
She... She knows me.
She helped us. Ask her! Ask her!

41:05.250 --> 41:07.875
Okay. Just calm down.
Anne, can I see you for a second?

41:09.541 --> 41:11.416
- Yes?
- Have you seen this man before?

41:12.791 --> 41:13.791
Yes.

41:14.166 --> 41:15.766
- He was here on my earlier shift.
- See?

41:15.833 --> 41:17.666
He was treated for a head injury.

41:18.791 --> 41:19.958
A head injury?

41:22.291 --> 41:23.583
That's not true.

41:23.666 --> 41:24.666
I see.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.958
Why are you lying?

41:26.041 --> 41:28.416
That is a pretty nasty contusion
you have there.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.375
You're lying.

41:29.458 --> 41:31.726
- Ray, I need you to calm down.
- Just leave me alone.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.017
- Ray, calm down.
- Stop calling me "Ray."

41:33.041 --> 41:35.916
You don't even know me.
What have you done to my family?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.791
- Where's my wife, huh?
- Calm down!

41:37.875 --> 41:39.101
Where'd you take my family?

41:39.125 --> 41:40.541
- Calm down!
- Get off me!

41:40.625 --> 41:42.625
- Calm down!
- Droperidol. Five milligrams.

41:42.708 --> 41:43.958
Get off me!

41:44.041 --> 41:45.841
- Hold him still.
- Calm down!

41:45.916 --> 41:47.125
Hold him still.

41:47.208 --> 41:48.208
Ah!

41:49.125 --> 41:49.958
Settle down!

41:50.041 --> 41:52.291
We cannot have you disrupting
this hospital.

41:52.375 --> 41:55.250
Hold him in four. I'll call upstairs.

41:56.125 --> 41:57.208
Oh, God.

42:03.666 --> 42:04.666
Yeah.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.791
- Hey. Hey.
- Hold tight.

42:08.416 --> 42:10.833
- Get up on there.
- Get off me. Get off.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.116
Yeah, you gonna keep swinging?

42:12.375 --> 42:14.250
Give me your hand. Give me your hand!

42:14.333 --> 42:15.833
Please, please. You don't need them.

42:15.916 --> 42:17.809
- You gonna behave yourself?
- Yeah.

42:17.833 --> 42:18.833
It's okay.

42:19.333 --> 42:22.625
I'm sorry. It's just...
Just a little confused, is all.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.761
Wipe your eyes with this.

42:25.875 --> 42:26.791
You're gonna be locked up in here

42:26.875 --> 42:28.392
until the doctor can figure out
what you need, okay?

42:28.416 --> 42:30.559
Lay down, let the sedative do its work.

42:30.583 --> 42:33.291
Yeah, sure.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.541
No...

43:11.333 --> 43:12.541
Come on, wake up.

43:14.625 --> 43:15.625
Wake up.

43:18.416 --> 43:20.041
Wake up! Where is it?

43:25.416 --> 43:27.125
Come on! Where is it?

43:27.208 --> 43:29.083
All right. Hey.

43:35.041 --> 43:36.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

43:47.750 --> 43:51.166
Okay. Come on.

44:13.958 --> 44:14.958
Three, two, one...

44:18.583 --> 44:19.666
Oh, my God!

44:24.625 --> 44:25.875
Call security!

44:26.416 --> 44:28.208
Hey!

44:48.791 --> 44:49.833
Hey. You remember me?

44:49.916 --> 44:52.316
You remember my daughter, Peri Monroe?

44:54.500 --> 44:56.309
<i>Your dad must have to keep
a shotgun handy</i>

44:56.333 --> 44:58.083
to chase off all the boys,
am I right?

45:01.291 --> 45:03.750
Hey! Hey! You!

45:11.791 --> 45:13.041
Oh! Hey!

45:14.083 --> 45:15.375
Oh!

45:20.916 --> 45:21.916
Hey!

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Oh, shit.

45:29.208 --> 45:30.208
Whoa!

45:30.791 --> 45:32.226
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

45:32.250 --> 45:33.625
Fuck!

45:38.500 --> 45:39.583
Ah!

46:06.166 --> 46:07.916
- <i>Hey, Jeff. Jeff?</i>
- Fuck.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.916
<i>Did you get him?</i>

46:09.000 --> 46:11.541
Yeah, Frank, he got away.

46:11.791 --> 46:13.833
<i>All right, what do you want me to do?</i>

46:13.916 --> 46:16.916
Let reception know
in case he thinks he's comin' back.

46:30.166 --> 46:31.166
Holy shit.

46:46.750 --> 46:50.291
Oh, God.

46:56.791 --> 46:58.416
Ah!

47:34.041 --> 47:37.041
<i>We had a noise complaint.
Two white males in a vacant lot.</i>

47:37.125 --> 47:38.750
<i>Looks like they may be getting high...</i>

47:38.833 --> 47:40.517
- Hey! Stop!
- Oh, Jesus. What the fuck?

47:40.541 --> 47:41.958
Help me! They've taken my family!

47:42.041 --> 47:44.392
They just took 'em, just took my family.
They won't let me see them.

47:44.416 --> 47:45.791
Step back. Calm down.

47:45.875 --> 47:48.142
Then they gave me this shot and this drug,
and they kind of knocked me out.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.559
- Relax.
- Maybe they gave the same thing

47:49.583 --> 47:50.726
to my wife,
'cause I don't know what's happening.

47:50.750 --> 47:52.390
- I don't know what happened.
- Calm down!

47:52.416 --> 47:54.916
- I... I'm calm. I'm calm.
- What are you talkin' about?

47:56.083 --> 48:00.208
She's... My daughter's in there,
and she's only six.

48:00.291 --> 48:01.833
Is this a custody thing?

48:01.916 --> 48:06.375
No. We came here to get help,
and now they're saying that she didn't...

48:06.500 --> 48:08.333
That she she never came here.

48:08.416 --> 48:10.208
All right? They've done something.

48:10.791 --> 48:13.072
They've done something,
and they're trying to cover it up.

48:13.375 --> 48:14.708
What happened to your hand?

48:15.416 --> 48:18.958
This? They locked me in a room.
I had to break out.

48:21.833 --> 48:25.083
- All right. Can I see some ID, please?
- Yeah.

48:25.833 --> 48:26.833
Here.

48:27.541 --> 48:29.833
Here. That's them. That's them.
That's my wife.

48:29.916 --> 48:31.333
That's... That's my daughter.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.750
We were... It was Thanksgiving.
We were just going home,

48:34.833 --> 48:37.083
and we stopped at this gas station,

48:37.416 --> 48:40.017
and she falls over, she hurts herself,
and that's why we came here.

48:40.041 --> 48:42.333
That's why I know they're still in there.

48:44.041 --> 48:45.333
Okay. What are their names?

48:45.791 --> 48:47.208
Joanne and Peri Monroe.

48:48.541 --> 48:49.958
And I'm... I'm Ray.

48:50.958 --> 48:51.791
Okay.

48:51.875 --> 48:53.559
- You're gonna help me?
- All right.

48:53.583 --> 48:55.743
Why don't we go inside
and see if we can sort this out?

48:56.125 --> 48:57.916
- Would you please?
- Okay.

48:59.333 --> 49:00.333
Come on.

49:02.125 --> 49:03.725
Hey, it's the front desk.

49:03.791 --> 49:06.125
Send somebody over here now.
It's him.

49:11.208 --> 49:12.875
Hey, we just dropped off that OD.

49:12.958 --> 49:14.226
Yes, what can I do for you?

49:14.250 --> 49:16.416
Okay, so, now we have this man here

49:16.500 --> 49:19.291
who says that you all
are holding his family against their will.

49:19.375 --> 49:21.017
- You stay away from me.
- That's ridiculous.

49:21.041 --> 49:21.875
That's the guy.

49:21.958 --> 49:25.458
That's the one that put me in the room,
and he held me against my will.

49:25.708 --> 49:28.541
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.

49:29.166 --> 49:31.375
All right, well,
he's saying that you roughed him up

49:31.458 --> 49:33.101
- and that you injected him with drugs.
- Yep.

49:33.125 --> 49:36.458
No, he was in earlier and acting a fool,
so the on-call doc gave him a sedative.

49:36.791 --> 49:38.142
- That's what happened.
- You're a liar.

49:38.166 --> 49:40.625
I'm not lying.
Why aren't you arresting his ass?

49:40.708 --> 49:42.388
Calm down. Let us handle this.

49:42.833 --> 49:45.291
Now, where did you last see
your wife and daughter?

49:46.416 --> 49:48.017
It was in the emergency ward,
it was ward nine.

49:48.041 --> 49:49.321
It was just through those doors.

49:49.375 --> 49:51.309
I can't believe you guys
are buying into this bullshit.

49:51.333 --> 49:53.666
I mean, he's a fuckin' head case!
Look at him.

49:55.083 --> 49:56.708
Want to take us to ward nine...

49:58.583 --> 49:59.583
Jeff?

50:01.291 --> 50:02.416
Today, please.

50:05.291 --> 50:07.875
Now, your chest X-rays
show a slight infiltration

50:07.958 --> 50:10.458
in the right lower front lobe
of your lungs...

50:10.541 --> 50:11.541
Doctor.

50:12.083 --> 50:14.364
Now do you want to tell me
where my wife and daughter are?

50:14.666 --> 50:16.708
- They should've locked you up!
- We'll handle this.

50:17.583 --> 50:18.583
He slipped out.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.916
Can you answer this man's question?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.480
He says that his wife and daughter
are missing in the hospital.

50:23.541 --> 50:25.166
The answer is, I don't know.

50:25.958 --> 50:28.958
According to our nursing staff,
Mr. Monroe came in alone,

50:29.041 --> 50:31.750
- wishing to be seen for a head injury.
- Peri was admitted.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.583
Where's her file? Where's her file?

50:34.666 --> 50:36.208
Can we take this to my office, please?

50:36.291 --> 50:39.375
Gotta be a record somewhere, right?
For patients admitted.

50:39.458 --> 50:41.208
I wasn't on call then.

50:41.291 --> 50:43.916
Sometimes files get misplaced

50:44.000 --> 50:47.750
or they get filed under the wrong name.
Maybe it wasn't entered into the system.

50:48.250 --> 50:49.375
These things happen.

50:49.458 --> 50:50.541
You're full of shit.

50:51.416 --> 50:54.041
You should call that Dr. Berthram,
all right?

50:54.291 --> 50:57.017
He sent Peri to get the CAT scan,
and that was the last time I saw him.

50:57.041 --> 50:58.625
Call... Dr. Berthram.

50:58.708 --> 51:00.125
This is ridiculous.

51:00.208 --> 51:01.541
Where's Dr. Berthram?

51:02.541 --> 51:04.916
He went off call. He's probably at home.

51:05.208 --> 51:06.351
Well, if he can sort this out,

51:06.375 --> 51:08.135
it's probably worth giving him a call,
right?

51:09.083 --> 51:10.083
Right?

51:12.791 --> 51:13.666
Call Gabe.

51:13.750 --> 51:15.101
Where do you do the CAT scans?

51:15.125 --> 51:18.208
Um... our imaging lab's
on the third floor.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.125
Okay.
Take us up there please.

51:21.375 --> 51:22.541
Take them up to three.

51:22.625 --> 51:23.625
Hang on.

51:24.750 --> 51:26.250
The CAT scans are downstairs.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.291
- No, our imaging lab's on the third floor.
- No, no, no.

51:30.416 --> 51:34.041
No, I saw them get in an elevator
and go down.

51:36.208 --> 51:39.458
He's obviously confused.
Our lab is on three.

51:39.541 --> 51:40.916
Can you take us up there, please?

52:01.458 --> 52:03.875
This computer keeps a log of usage.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.125
There's date, time, and duration.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.333
You can see this machine
was used at 9:07 a.m.

52:12.416 --> 52:16.125
for a duration lasting exactly 29 minutes.

52:17.166 --> 52:18.666
And that was the last time.

52:21.125 --> 52:23.708
Can you see this clearly, Mr. Monroe?

52:27.416 --> 52:28.958
Yeah, it doesn't prove anything.

52:29.416 --> 52:31.083
It proves no one had a scan

52:31.166 --> 52:33.458
at the time you say
your daughter was here.

52:34.583 --> 52:38.250
- Makes sense.
- Excuse me.

52:42.625 --> 52:43.875
You can see this, right?

52:44.666 --> 52:46.726
Yeah, she wasn't here,
because they never brought her here.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.101
She didn't have a CAT scan.
They just took her somewhere else.

52:49.125 --> 52:50.125
Where?

52:50.166 --> 52:51.375
I don't know.

52:51.750 --> 52:52.666
And why?

52:52.750 --> 52:55.041
I don't know.
You're the detective, you figure it out.

52:55.125 --> 52:57.416
I just know that there's something wrong
with this place.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.875
Dr. Berthram,
who was attending this morning,

52:59.958 --> 53:01.208
will be here shortly.

53:01.583 --> 53:03.875
Good. Maybe he can clear all this up.

53:04.291 --> 53:05.583
Oh, I certainly hope so.

53:10.041 --> 53:11.750
- And there you go.
- Thanks.

53:12.791 --> 53:15.250
- What's your name, baby?
- Anne.

53:15.750 --> 53:18.500
Hmm. So, Anne... double shifts?

53:18.583 --> 53:20.666
Single gal's gotta make a living.

53:20.791 --> 53:22.751
Yes, she does.

53:23.208 --> 53:25.489
You ever sleep?
What time you get off tonight?

53:25.750 --> 53:28.333
Okay, well, this is him. Ray Monroe.

53:28.416 --> 53:31.833
Found this in the trash out front.
It's the morning sign-in list.

53:34.458 --> 53:36.916
Here's my name. There's my name.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.541
Ray, it's... it's your name.

53:38.625 --> 53:40.851
- I signed in for Peri.
- No, you signed in for yourself.

53:40.875 --> 53:42.625
What's going on, Aaron?

53:42.916 --> 53:45.166
Anne said something
about missing patients.

53:45.250 --> 53:47.370
- You know me, right? Remember?
- All right, back off.

53:47.458 --> 53:49.625
All right?
You saw my little girl, all right?

53:49.708 --> 53:51.958
You... You treated her arm. You... You...

53:52.708 --> 53:54.726
- Do you remember this man?
- Tell 'em!

53:54.750 --> 53:56.666
Tell them, please!

53:58.541 --> 54:00.458
I do. He was here earlier today.

54:00.666 --> 54:02.791
- Yes! Yes!
- All right.

54:03.291 --> 54:04.708
And what were the circumstances?

54:04.791 --> 54:06.059
We have been all through this...

54:06.083 --> 54:07.333
I'm talking to Dr. Berthram.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.208
- What were the circumstances?
- Uh...

54:13.583 --> 54:14.583
He was, um...

54:15.500 --> 54:19.333
He was a walk-in,
and one of our doctors, Bruce Volk,

54:19.875 --> 54:21.250
um, he examined him.

54:21.958 --> 54:25.458
He told Anne
that he had been in a car accident.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.416
Uh... Uh...

54:28.791 --> 54:31.583
His behavior seemed rather... erratic.

54:32.375 --> 54:34.541
Dr. Volk asked me to take a look.

54:35.375 --> 54:39.750
So I suggested maybe doing a head CT,
which he refused.

54:39.833 --> 54:43.041
He insisted on going back out
to the lobby to wait for his wife.

54:43.125 --> 54:45.416
- Wh... What was her name?
- Abby.

54:46.916 --> 54:48.750
Abby was her name.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.625
Thought you said
your wife's name was Joanne.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.958
- It is.
- Then who's Abby?

55:00.000 --> 55:01.125
She's my first wife.

55:03.875 --> 55:05.083
Where's Abby now?

55:05.875 --> 55:07.625
She's dead.

55:08.625 --> 55:09.625
She died.

55:10.750 --> 55:12.958
She had nothing to do
with Joanne and Peri.

55:13.041 --> 55:14.250
Joanne and Peri?

55:14.541 --> 55:16.916
Who he claims is his current wife
and child.

55:17.375 --> 55:18.500
This is real.

55:19.166 --> 55:21.166
This is Joanne, and this is Peri.

55:21.250 --> 55:25.041
Periwinkle. You remember?
Because that's Joanne's favorite shell.

55:25.125 --> 55:27.083
And that's my family, and I love them.

55:27.166 --> 55:28.684
What does your first wife have to do

55:28.708 --> 55:31.291
- with any of this?
- Nothin'.

55:32.208 --> 55:34.875
You got Abby's name
from the insurance information, right?

55:35.750 --> 55:38.250
And you're just using it
against me to make me look crazy,

55:38.333 --> 55:39.416
when, in reality,

55:40.750 --> 55:42.767
you've kidnapped my family,
and you've done something to 'em.

55:42.791 --> 55:44.500
All right, enough. Enough.

55:45.083 --> 55:47.375
Okay, there's a simple enough way
to confirm or deny

55:47.458 --> 55:48.916
any of this guy's bullshit.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
Right there.

55:53.375 --> 55:55.333
This is today's waiting room feed.

55:56.666 --> 55:58.708
What time did you say
you came in with your family?

55:59.041 --> 56:00.083
Late morning.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.291
So, we'll start at 9:00 a.m.

56:02.750 --> 56:04.875
Work our way forward from there
until we see you.

56:10.125 --> 56:11.125
Stop. Stop.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.750
Go back.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.458
Okay, this is me coming in,

56:18.166 --> 56:20.041
and Joanne was carrying Peri behind me.

56:21.791 --> 56:23.208
All right, there I am. Right.

56:23.291 --> 56:27.125
This is where she said wait.
Um, I went back to the seating area.

56:27.250 --> 56:29.184
What are those?
Those little glitches?

56:29.208 --> 56:30.267
It's an older system.

56:30.291 --> 56:33.333
Records 30 seconds out of every minute,
so there's gonna be gaps.

56:33.708 --> 56:35.375
That's pretty convenient.

56:35.583 --> 56:38.392
- Well, where's your family?
- They're right there. Just...

56:38.416 --> 56:40.000
Can you... They're under the camera.

56:40.083 --> 56:42.309
You can't see where they're sitting
'cause of the chairs.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.500
You got a better angle?

56:43.583 --> 56:46.583
The ones you see are the ones
that are workin' out there.

56:47.541 --> 56:49.916
Just fast forward, fast forward.

56:50.833 --> 56:51.666
Stop.

56:51.750 --> 56:54.710
All right, there I am coming back.
That's after Peri went for the CAT scan.

56:55.666 --> 56:58.291
Yeah.
Never saw you go in with 'em, though.

57:06.208 --> 57:07.583
Your security system is shit.

57:07.666 --> 57:09.875
You've got nothing of my family going in.

57:10.041 --> 57:12.000
- Excuse me.
- This is just shit!

57:12.250 --> 57:14.500
Do you have any footage
from inside the ER?

57:15.041 --> 57:16.851
We don't record
in the treatment areas.

57:16.875 --> 57:18.583
Uh, legal reasons, patient privacy.

57:18.666 --> 57:19.809
Is Dr. Jacobs on call?

57:19.833 --> 57:22.375
Check the hallways.
Check the hallways. Check 'em, all right?

57:22.458 --> 57:24.291
You have better camera placement
in the hall.

57:24.375 --> 57:25.684
We're gonna be here all fuckin' night.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.541
- Search the hospital!
- Okay, that's not happening.

57:29.250 --> 57:31.517
First, we would need a warrant.
Then we would need probable cause,

57:31.541 --> 57:34.184
and there's nothing on that video
that proves anyone is even missing.

57:34.208 --> 57:37.875
You think that I'm faking?
You think I'm making them up?

57:37.958 --> 57:39.375
I showed you the picture!

57:39.458 --> 57:40.833
That could be anybody.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.625
Your sister, niece.

57:43.125 --> 57:45.333
I mean,
the person you keep talking about is Abby.

57:45.416 --> 57:48.833
I don't keep talking about Abby.
You keep talking about Abby.

57:48.916 --> 57:53.083
Come on.
Come on, Ray. You got this.

58:00.791 --> 58:04.375
The cashier
at the service station where Peri fell,

58:04.458 --> 58:05.666
she saw us together.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.500
There's a Gas and Go,
it's a couple of miles from here. Ask her.

58:11.708 --> 58:12.958
- Ask her.
- Uh-huh.

58:14.166 --> 58:16.017
- I'll see if I can track her down.
- Thank you.

58:16.041 --> 58:16.875
Okay.

58:16.958 --> 58:18.625
Mr. Monroe,

58:19.291 --> 58:23.375
I think we found someone back in the ward
that can help us clear everything up.

58:23.916 --> 58:24.916
Let's go.

58:25.666 --> 58:26.666
Let's go, then.

58:28.541 --> 58:29.958
Call if you need backup.

58:30.958 --> 58:33.541
She's already here.

59:17.875 --> 59:18.875
It's Peri's.

59:20.458 --> 59:21.750
This is Peri's scarf.

59:22.875 --> 59:23.958
Jo gave it to me.

59:24.041 --> 59:28.083
It must've dropped out
when we were here this morning.

59:28.666 --> 59:30.291
Can you prove it in some way?

59:30.375 --> 59:32.291
- I mean, is her name on the tag?
- It's hers!

59:32.375 --> 59:34.625
- Is there a receipt?
- It's hers.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.583
Can I see it, please?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.458
Yes. Just, gentle...

59:39.916 --> 59:40.916
Gentle.

59:49.166 --> 59:50.250
Is this her blood too?

59:51.500 --> 59:53.583
It's... It's my blood.

59:55.416 --> 59:58.083
It's my blood from my head
when we fell into the pit.

59:58.166 --> 59:59.375
You know that.

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:03.291
Look, with a head injury...

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:06.916
it's not uncommon to be confused
or to mix things up,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.916
and you're obviously confused.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
No, no, no.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.458
Why would I have my daughter's scarf
and not her?

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:15.833
And this is her scarf

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:17.250
'cause she had it in the car

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:18.726
when we were coming back
from Thanksgiving,

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.892
and she wanted some batteries,
so we stopped in a service station.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:23.101
She fell, she went in the hole,
and I fell in on top of her,

01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:24.392
and that's where she got the blood.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.000
And then we came here
because she had a broken arm, and she...

01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:28.333
We saw you and...

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:32.458
Stop! Get your shit together, man,
or you going to jail!

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:33.583
Do you understand?

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:36.708
You understand? Get it together.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Hello, Ray.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:45.000
I'm Dr. Teresa Jacobs.

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.791
I work in the psychiatric department
for the county.

01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:52.500
You're a shrink?

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:54.833
I prefer "medical counselor," but...

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.291
"shrink," sure.

01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:58.208
I am not crazy.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.000
No one is saying that you are.

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:05.208
I'd like to help you find out
what happened to Joanne and Peri.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:08.041
We're as concerned about them as you are.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.250
- I doubt that.
- You should think about listening, man.

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:15.250
Officer, thank you. I can handle this now.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.750
You want to come somewhere more private
and talk about this?

01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:22.833
Yeah.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500
Good.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Come on, then.

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:32.041
So, I thought you might be happy to know

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:34.125
they found your admissions file.

01:01:34.916 --> 01:01:35.916
Yeah.

01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:37.791
Oh, finally.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:42.791
It's, um, your file,
Ray, not your daughter's.

01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:45.291
There's no mention of Peri in here.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.333
No, it's just bullshit
that they just made up.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.500
I was hoping you could talk a bit
about what happened

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.208
before the car accident.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.166
It wasn't a car accident.

01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:00.958
She fell at a construction site.

01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:02.916
Okay, sorry, I only know what's in here.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.708
Maybe you could tell me
what you remember.

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:07.541
I remember everything.
Don't treat me like I'm crazy.

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:10.333
I am treating you
as a rational human being, Ray.

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:13.791
Right now, all I've got to go on
is your word that they were here at all.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
There's this.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.500
This proves that they were here...

01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:20.625
and that they are hiding them.

01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:22.666
He's just hiding everything...

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.458
Hiding... what?

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.642
That your wife and little girl came in
at random for treatment?

01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:28.833
Why would we do that?

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.333
Oh, you work here, you tell me.

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:35.833
Tell me about Abby.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.583
She was your first wife?

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:41.333
It's not got anything to do with Abby.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.833
- And she died?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.041
Eight years ago.

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:47.583
Why don't you tell me what happened?

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:49.291
It was an accident.

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:52.041
She...
It was a head-on collision.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:54.666
Car accident?

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:56.083
Yeah.

01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:59.166
This has nothing to do with this...

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.958
or my family now.

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:04.708
In the file,
you mentioned a drinking problem.

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:08.458
That day, Ray,

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:10.458
had you been drinking?

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:13.958
<i>Ray! Ray!</i>

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:20.250
When the accident happened, Ray,

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:23.375
were you too drunk to help Abby?

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:24.625
You didn't even see.

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:26.500
You didn't see it.

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:28.750
Nothing could help her.

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.250
I couldn't.

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:32.333
Have you ever had blackouts, Ray?

01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:34.083
- Moments of missing time?
- Oh, God.

01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:36.791
I don't drink. I don't drink anymore.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:39.115
- I haven't had a drink in eight years.
- Why...

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:43.875
did you tell the staff
that you were waiting for Abby, Ray?

01:03:44.166 --> 01:03:45.833
Help me understand all this.

01:03:45.916 --> 01:03:50.041
Abby died
in a car accident eight years ago,

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.708
and it kills me.

01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:54.458
Every day. It just...

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:57.500
All right.

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:01.333
I'm gonna say something,

01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.125
and it's gonna be hard to hear.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.541
But you have to listen, Ray,

01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:12.083
because I believe you.

01:04:12.875 --> 01:04:16.500
I believe something happened
to Peri and Joanne...

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.791
Which is why...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.416
I think we should take a look at the spot

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.458
where Peri had her accident.

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.833
Why? There's nothing there.

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:30.416
I think it's a good idea, Ray.

01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:35.500
If you'll excuse me for a moment, hmm?

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:53.833
He's obviously experiencing
some deep trauma.

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:55.166
He's confused.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:59.500
I suggest going back to the place
he claims his daughter was hurt.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.125
What are you thinking?

01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.125
They might still be out there.

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:06.041
Oh, God.

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:10.500
I'll, uh, put a call into the canine unit
and see if they can meet us

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.143
- at the gas station.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.541
The place is closed,

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:16.291
but I've got dispatch
trying to track down the cashier.

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:19.916
Um, it might be good for us
if you come along.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.375
- Of course.
- They're not out there.

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:26.583
Maybe you're all in on this,
or maybe you're not.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.833
The fact is, my wife and daughter
went down a hallway in this hospital

01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:31.208
and never came back,

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.875
and that's what happened.

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.333
Is that it, up ahead?

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.041
Yeah.

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:51.767
Thanks for coming so quickly.

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:53.625
No problem. What have you got?

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:56.541
Two missing persons,
a woman and child.

01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:58.125
You got an incident site?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.666
Ray, where did your daughter fall?

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:06.515
Got a scent source for Mandy?

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:09.416
Can I see that scarf, Ray?

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:14.625
The only thing that dog's gonna smell
is that we were here earlier.

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:17.666
We have to start somewhere, Ray.

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:39.375
Mandy, find.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.375
Good girl. Good girl.

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.958
- What happened here, Ray?
- Nothing.

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:12.916
Just, Peri lost a compact, you know?
This tiny toy mirror,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.333
and she was upset, so...

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.916
me and Jo, we looked for it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.457
She looked in the bathroom,
I looked in the car, and then...

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:21.125
and I lost sight of her for a second.

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:23.582
And I look up,
and there's this dog growlin' at her,

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.750
and she spooked and fell.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:27.250
It was nothing.

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:31.125
Here we go.
I think she's got something.

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:32.832
We got something.

01:08:35.666 --> 01:08:36.666
Come on.

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:49.125
Let me see it.
Let me see it. Please.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:52.625
Please. Just give that to me.
It's Peri's. That's what Peri lost.

01:08:52.707 --> 01:08:54.416
Please, that's Peri's compact.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.457
Must have just been in her pocket
the whole time,

01:08:58.541 --> 01:09:01.332
and it just fell out when she fell.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.707
And the blood?
That's your daughter's blood?

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.291
It's my blood. I hit my head.

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.892
- Oh, it's yours? You hit your head.
- Yeah.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:30.332
That's way too much blood!

01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.957
That's my blood.
I hit my head, man, look at...

01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.322
- Look! Look at it!
- Get the fuck off me, you crazy fuck!

01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:37.832
- Hey!
- No more.

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:39.166
This is a crime scene now.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.291
- Go call the CSI unit.
- Fuckin' nuts, man.

01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:45.377
Keep on looking.
There might be more.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:51.750
He planted it. He planted the mirror!

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:52.957
He planted it.

01:09:53.041 --> 01:09:54.416
Did he plant the blood too?

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:56.291
Maybe you did!

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:59.000
- Really?
- Officer. Just give us a second here.

01:10:00.166 --> 01:10:01.767
You gotta help me.
You see what's happening here?

01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.250
- You gotta help me.
- I am trying to help you, Ray.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.958
Now, I asked you once before.
Let me ask you again...

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.333
what happened before the accident?

01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:15.750
Were you upset about something?

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.750
U-Upset at your daughter, maybe?

01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:18.958
I was...

01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:21.375
I had a fight with my wife
about my marriage.

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.875
So, I know that she's not happy.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:28.208
I know that she just wants me
to try harder. And I do try hard!

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:32.000
I told Peri, "Just stay there." Right?
"Just stay right there."

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.500
And she didn't listen,
and she should have listened!

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.166
So you were angry with her.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.370
Yeah, I was angry.
I picked up a rock, and I threw it.

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:39.833
At who?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.666
At... At the dog.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.541
I tried hard.

01:10:47.333 --> 01:10:50.291
I tried really hard
to... to... to-to grab her.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:53.625
She still fell.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Ray...

01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:10.833
are you sure there was a dog?

01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:18.416
There was no dog, was there, Ray?

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.083
There was no accident.

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.125
Peri didn't fall.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:25.791
You made that all up.

01:11:26.458 --> 01:11:27.791
It happened!

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.458
It's... That's all that happened.

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:33.708
Think, Ray.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.458
You were upset at your daughter,

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:38.750
angry at your wife,

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.416
angry at yourself.

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:45.250
So you picked up a rock.

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.125
When it was over,

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:56.875
you were so angry at yourself
at what you'd done...

01:11:58.583 --> 01:11:59.916
Then Joanne appears.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:01.125
<i>Ray!</i>

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.041
So you... lash out.

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.125
<i>No! No!</i>

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.583
That's what happened, isn't it, Ray?

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.708
- Are you hurt?
- The mind, Ray,

01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:18.750
it can sometimes create
an alternate reality, a false reality,

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:21.541
to shield itself from trauma.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:24.416
<i>From the things we fear,</i>

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:28.583
<i>from the horrors we can't even imagine.</i>

01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.166
Is it broken?

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:33.166
You lost your family once before,

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:37.583
and when you saw
what you'd done to Peri...

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.416
and then Joanne,

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:46.333
your mind couldn't accept the fact
that it had happened all over again.

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.916
And at your hands.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I would never hurt you, sweetie.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.625
Where are they, Ray?

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.333
Where are Peri and Joanne?

01:13:07.666 --> 01:13:10.333
Where did you put them?

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.458
Ray?

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:19.708
Ray?

01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.500
Stand up, Mr. Monroe.

01:13:33.791 --> 01:13:35.458
Stand up, Mr. Monroe!

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.250
Stand up.

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.625
Get up, right now.

01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:48.791
Mr. Monroe, you are under arrest
for the suspicion of murder.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.892
You have the right to remain silent.

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:54.208
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:57.125
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford an attorney,

01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:59.708
one will be provided for you...

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:03.958
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.250
<i>Don't move.</i>

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:08.213
It's going to be okay.
I'm just gonna scare him.

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.000
Daddy!

01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:11.583
No!

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:14.625
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:16.500
I don't think so.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.208
It happened.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.375
No, Ray!

01:14:25.458 --> 01:14:27.583
Put it down. Put it down.
Put down all your guns.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.750
- Okay...
- Do it now. Now!

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:30.833
Now!

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.541
Put down your guns and your radios
and kick 'em away.

01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:38.250
- You too!
- You know you're fucking yourself, right?

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.041
You stay up there. Right.

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:44.166
Now, everybody up. Everybody out!

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.791
You go, get out! Go on, go up!

01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.291
Everybody up!

01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.666
I know you won't hurt me, Ray.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.541
You think that I've murdered my wife
and my daughter.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.208
So who are you to me?

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:00.375
Now move it.

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:02.541
Move!

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.208
Come on, round the side.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:07.291
Now open that door.

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:09.791
All right, now get in. Everyone in.

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:11.875
Come on. Come on.

01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.541
All right.

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.791
- Give me your key card.
- Ray...

01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:18.875
if you thought seeing that dog

01:15:18.958 --> 01:15:21.250
somehow makes everything else
you believe true,

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:22.583
you are wrong.

01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:24.083
Or you're wrong.

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:27.625
Give me the card.

01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:32.708
- Mistake.
- Well, we'll see.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:48.083
You motherfucker!
You motherfucker! You're so fucked!

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:21.416
I'm coming for you.

01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:49.750
- Still seeing Phil from radiology?
- I don't think so.

01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:15.916
Ah.

01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:36.958
I tell you, Terry,
what a long day that was.

01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:48.916
Pretty crazy, huh?

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:53.250
I mean,
I'm afraid to even pick mine up, you know?

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:55.333
What if I drop him?

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.250
So, is this your first?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.166
<i>Ray, watch out!</i>

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.041
<i>Sorry, Mr. Monroe. She's gone.</i>

01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:09.458
<i>They're both gone.</i>

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.833
That's it. Call it.

01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:24.375
I'm sorry, Mr. Monroe. They're gone.

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:28.416
Abby...

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.708
<i>Do something.</i>

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.500
<i>Do something.</i>

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.416
Hey.

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:04.375
Eighty-two degrees.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:05.666
Heads up.

01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:10.250
Help me. Help me.

01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:13.041
Help me, please.

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:16.083
Help.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:31.291
Doctor? Doctor!

01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:33.458
Sign in, please.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.875
Thank you. Good work.

01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:01.125
Come on... Come on.

01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:17.541
Oh, fuck...

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.500
Go!

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.875
Just... Just...

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.083
...stop.

01:20:43.166 --> 01:20:44.416
Just stop.

01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:50.875
I just want to get my family...
and I want to go home.

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:54.458
Just point the barrel away. All right?

01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:02.375
Okay.

01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:06.375
I'll take you to your family, all right?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.208
They're right downstairs.

01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:12.333
Thirty seconds away.

01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:17.875
Give me...
Give me the keys.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.208
Yeah.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.166
Okay.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.416
This is over!

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:10.083
Give me my family!

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:11.291
<i>I hope you feel better.</i>

01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:07.333
<i>EMS just brought in
a couple head traumas.</i>

01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:09.583
<i>Head-on collision. Drunk driver.</i>

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:15.208
<i>The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.</i>

01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:23.916
<i>Would you like Peri listed
for organ donation?</i>

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.541
<i>No.</i>

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:27.375
Can I convince you to reconsider?

01:26:09.041 --> 01:26:11.458
Don't touch her!
Get back! Away from the table.

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:16.208
Put that down! Put it down!
Back against the wall! Peri...

01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:21.041
Peri? Stay there.

01:26:22.416 --> 01:26:23.416
Oh...

01:26:28.125 --> 01:26:29.666
Take off your mask.

01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:32.708
Take it off.

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:45.708
You're a monster.

01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.958
You're all monsters.

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.750
Ray, don't do this.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:56.041
Don't worry, baby. I got you, baby.

01:26:56.125 --> 01:26:57.750
You don't need to do this.

01:26:57.833 --> 01:26:59.583
- Ray... Ray...
<i>- </i> Jo?

01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:03.583
Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo!

01:27:03.958 --> 01:27:05.375
No.

01:27:05.458 --> 01:27:07.458
Ray... Ray...

01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:10.000
- Come on. Come on.
- Ray...

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:14.166
You think you can cut up my family?

01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:17.125
You think you can just cut up
my little girl?

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:18.958
Put the gun away.

01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:20.333
Nobody needs to get hurt.

01:27:20.416 --> 01:27:21.458
Daddy's here.

01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:24.625
Ray, you are deeply confused.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:35.708
I'm not afraid of you.

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:40.000
Ray, don't do this, please.

01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:41.375
Ray... Ray...

01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:43.041
They drugged us.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.208
I know. Hold on to Peri.

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.291
Ray.

01:27:46.666 --> 01:27:48.375
You're not seeing things clearly.

01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:51.208
I've never felt more clear.

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:55.208
Come on, come on.

01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:01.583
Hold him down!

01:28:02.791 --> 01:28:04.666
Propofol, 15 milligrams!

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:18.000
Ray!

01:28:46.375 --> 01:28:49.666
Oh, Jo, you're okay!

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:50.958
You're okay.

01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:59.708
I got you. I got you.

01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:04.583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:29:06.333 --> 01:29:07.583
Just get out of my way.

01:29:07.666 --> 01:29:10.208
Mr. Monroe, listen to me.
You gotta listen to me.

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:13.416
We can't let you leave.
You can't leave here.

01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:15.416
You remember me?

01:29:15.791 --> 01:29:18.458
I'm Dr. Bruce Volk. Do you remember?

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:22.267
Look, we just want to help you.
Why don't you just put the gun down...

01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:25.541
Fuck! Shit!

01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:28.458
I did it.

01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:31.291
Yeah, I did it.

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:33.750
You fucking shot me!

01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:35.416
I did it.

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.541
Fuck you!

01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:45.625
We're nearly there.

01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.666
Here you go. Stay warm.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.625
Daddy?

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:05.375
Yeah?

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.208
Are we home yet?

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:09.583
Soon, sweetheart.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.500
Soon.

01:30:48.208 --> 01:30:49.208
You okay?

01:30:53.833 --> 01:30:54.875
We are now.

01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:58.875
My arm, Daddy, it still hurts.

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:03.458
Well, how about a song,
will that make you feel better?

01:31:04.416 --> 01:31:05.666
Mm-hmm.
