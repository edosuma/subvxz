01:31.792 --> 01:34.292
Radio Moscow.
Director Andreyev. What is it?

01:37.667 --> 01:38.917
Seventeen minutes.

01:39.709 --> 01:42.626
Yes, of course I can ring back
in 17 minutes.

01:43.584 --> 01:44.584
Yeah.

01:45.626 --> 01:47.751
Mm-hm.
Yes, I'm writing it down.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.376
I can't get the...

01:50.501 --> 01:52.626
One, five...

01:54.126 --> 01:56.167
Sorry? Was that a nine, as in "fine"?

01:56.667 --> 01:59.001
Or... or another five as in, um...

01:59.584 --> 02:01.167
- "Hive."
- ..."hive"?

02:02.376 --> 02:04.542
Hello? Hello?

02:10.001 --> 02:12.167
- Hive?
- Who was it?

02:12.334 --> 02:14.417
The Secretariat
of the General Secretariat.

02:14.542 --> 02:17.417
Of the General Secretary.
The Secretary of the General...

02:17.542 --> 02:18.667
Stalin?

02:21.167 --> 02:22.876
Turn that down.

02:24.126 --> 02:25.376
Put that apple down.

02:25.459 --> 02:27.126
You're always eating bloody apples.

02:27.209 --> 02:29.251
I'm to call him back
in 17 minutes.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.185
Seventeen minutes from when
you picked up the phone

02:31.209 --> 02:33.167
or from when you put it down?

02:33.334 --> 02:37.251
Seventeen minutes from when I said
I'd call back in 17 minutes.

02:37.376 --> 02:39.376
- When was that?
- I don't know.

02:40.042 --> 02:41.167
Thirty seconds ago?

02:42.626 --> 02:44.084
- A minute?
- Well, which one?

02:44.209 --> 02:45.209
- A minute.
- A minute?

02:45.334 --> 02:46.417
A minute.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.834
- You sure?
- No.

02:54.084 --> 02:55.334
Well, well, well.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.584
Oh, I put Shteyman
on the list, the writer.

02:59.709 --> 03:03.167
- I know you like his work, but...
- No, leave him on.

03:03.292 --> 03:06.417
And, uh... Shteyman two, his wife?

03:06.542 --> 03:07.584
On.

03:08.167 --> 03:09.376
They're a couple, ain't they?

03:10.501 --> 03:12.310
We're talking about Stalingrad,
how cold it was,

03:12.334 --> 03:15.834
and we would do anything,
anything, to warm ourselves up.

03:16.001 --> 03:17.834
We'd throw live grenades
to each other.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.126
We'd pull the pin,
throw it to the prisoners.

03:20.209 --> 03:24.376
They'd be jumping around
like drunken whores. "Oh, oh, oh!"

03:24.459 --> 03:26.626
What was the grenade?

03:27.292 --> 03:28.834
- A grenade.
- Georgy.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.584
- A grenade... what do you...
- No no no.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.584
You're obstructing the story.
Let him tell it.

03:41.292 --> 03:43.792
<i>So, ten past, the call came in.</i>

03:44.251 --> 03:46.834
- Seventeen minutes...
- So call back 10:27?

03:47.959 --> 03:50.501
- Yeah.
- You don't seem confident.

03:50.626 --> 03:53.292
Well, I wasn't the one
on the phone.

03:53.376 --> 03:54.935
And it was definitely a nine,
wasn't it?

03:54.959 --> 03:57.417
- I wasn't the one on the phone.
- You keep saying that.

03:57.542 --> 04:01.834
- It's not helping.
- I wasn't, though. So...

04:01.959 --> 04:03.417
A grenade in his mouth!

04:04.917 --> 04:07.334
- Always cracks me up, this one.
- And then boom!

04:07.459 --> 04:08.667
I'll have these dispatched.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.876
That's how you turn a Prussian
into a bowl of soup.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.334
Oh, there he goes.

04:13.459 --> 04:15.209
Yes, we see your list, Beria.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.334
Shoot her before him,
but make sure he sees it.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.084
Oh, and this one... um...

04:24.042 --> 04:26.626
Kill him, take him to his church,
dump him in the pulpit.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.251
And I'll leave the rest
up to you.

04:30.459 --> 04:32.209
Let's go!

04:50.709 --> 04:53.626
First three names on list.
Top name, apartment 15. Go.

04:53.751 --> 04:54.917
Go, go.

05:16.459 --> 05:20.001
Come on. Where are you going?
Get round here. Get on the bus.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.376
Comrade, it's the greatest honour.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.001
He can't see me bow.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.542
- Comrade Director.
- Oh, shit.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.876
Five... nine.

05:40.251 --> 05:41.292
Hello.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.084
This is Stalin.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.792
Bravo!

05:44.917 --> 05:47.917
Sorry. It's really noisy.
I'm sorry about that.

05:48.042 --> 05:50.584
How are you?
How is it wherever you are?

05:50.709 --> 05:52.084
Sorry. Sorry again.

05:52.209 --> 05:54.126
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Receiving you.

05:55.334 --> 05:57.417
I want a recording
of tonight's performance.

05:57.501 --> 05:58.959
I'll send someone to pick it up.

06:00.209 --> 06:01.834
I think you split
a couple of notes.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.376
You cheeky bugger. I did not.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.310
- How was it? Was it good?
- I thought wonderful.

06:05.334 --> 06:06.834
Was the concerto recorded?

06:08.751 --> 06:12.084
Was it recorded? Please say yes.

06:12.376 --> 06:16.292
- Erm... no. It went out live.
- Stay. Stay.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.584
Okay, nobody leave! Nobody leave!
Lock the doors! Lock those doors!

06:19.709 --> 06:21.435
If you wouldn't mind
just taking your seats again.

06:21.459 --> 06:22.542
That would be fantastic.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.352
Take your seats.
Take your fucking seats.

06:24.376 --> 06:28.084
Don't worry, nobody's
gonna get killed, I promise you.

06:28.209 --> 06:30.959
This is just
a musical emergency.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.292
Take your seats. That's it.

06:32.417 --> 06:33.959
Nobody be alarmed. It's fine.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.501
Sit down! Do not defy me!

06:36.667 --> 06:38.334
Sit your arses down!

06:40.751 --> 06:43.126
Top me up. Everybody drinks.

06:43.209 --> 06:45.501
As I was saying,
we had this 12-year-old scout.

06:45.626 --> 06:47.542
His whole family
was wiped out by the Krauts.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.626
But before that he taught us
this trick. He taught us this trick.

06:50.751 --> 06:53.376
He taught us this trick.
If you stick somebody's little finger

06:53.501 --> 06:56.667
in a glass of water
while they're sleeping,

06:56.792 --> 06:58.001
they wet themselves.

06:59.917 --> 07:00.959
Here, what next?

07:01.084 --> 07:02.501
You stick a bar of chocolate

07:02.584 --> 07:04.167
in their pocket,
they shit their pants?

07:07.917 --> 07:12.251
But it's biology, Chief.
We did it to Polnikov in Stalingrad.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.626
But, anyway,
"shit your pants", that's great.

07:14.751 --> 07:16.251
Whatever became of Polnikov?

07:20.209 --> 07:22.667
You wanna know
where fucking Polnikov is?

07:23.834 --> 07:24.917
You wanna go there?

07:26.001 --> 07:28.126
I love that grenade story.

07:29.417 --> 07:32.959
- Oh, is there one in your pocket?
- No, no, come on. No, not again!

07:33.042 --> 07:35.334
No, don't you...

07:35.459 --> 07:37.667
God damn it!

07:37.792 --> 07:40.167
Caught red-handed.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.376
Well, I would die for the Motherland!

07:45.209 --> 07:47.542
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:05.251 --> 08:06.584
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.126
Take this, you bastards!

08:12.459 --> 08:13.667
All right, let's get going.

08:13.751 --> 08:16.584
Time for a cowboy movie.
Who's in my posse?

08:19.501 --> 08:22.542
Here we go. He rides out,
he gets shot off his horse.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.209
Adios.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.626
Thank you very much.
It's gonna be okay.

08:30.709 --> 08:31.834
Sit where you sat before.

08:32.376 --> 08:34.376
Right, what do you think?

08:34.626 --> 08:37.501
Well, half the audience have gone.
The acoustic will be very lively.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.667
Go and get some more people
in off the street.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.626
Fat ones, so we don't need as many.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.084
Really? How fat?

08:45.167 --> 08:48.501
I could get my wife.
She'd deaden the acoustic.

08:48.626 --> 08:51.376
Comrades...
Comrades, shut up!

08:52.001 --> 08:53.459
I have wonderful news.

08:53.584 --> 08:56.667
Comrade Stalin
loved tonight's concerto

08:56.792 --> 08:59.167
and would like
a recording of it right away,

08:59.334 --> 09:02.959
which we don't have, for reasons
that are myriad and complex and...

09:03.084 --> 09:09.334
But meanwhile the concerto
we just played will be played again.

09:09.459 --> 09:13.542
And this time we will record it
and we will applaud it.

09:16.001 --> 09:17.334
Yes. Yes.

09:32.209 --> 09:33.959
Brilliant. Okay.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.042
Excuse me.

09:37.667 --> 09:38.751
I won't do it.

09:40.084 --> 09:42.626
Come on, through here.
In you come.

09:46.001 --> 09:47.334
Sit down. Sit down.

09:48.459 --> 09:50.584
You, Joan of Arc,
do you want to get killed?

09:50.667 --> 09:52.834
Like my father got killed,
my brother? Like that?

09:53.667 --> 09:57.292
- But they would want you to live.
- I won't do it. You can't force me.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.185
- Can't we just get another pianist?
- That would be ridiculous.

10:00.209 --> 10:02.001
The sound would be
completely different.

10:02.126 --> 10:03.626
- Even Stalin could...
- Even?

10:03.959 --> 10:06.501
- I didn't mean...
- Even Stalin?

10:06.667 --> 10:08.126
I hope this office isn't bugged.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.685
Of course Comrade Stalin would
be able to tell the difference.

10:11.709 --> 10:15.001
He's a great man with a great ear.

10:15.126 --> 10:17.834
- Two great ears.
- Sharp. They're sharp.

10:17.959 --> 10:21.542
- The sharpest ears in the...
- In the Soviet Union.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.459
Maria Veniaminovna,
you have to play.

10:24.584 --> 10:26.501
I didn't...
I didn't mean what I said.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.792
So you said it, then?

10:28.751 --> 10:33.084
As God is my witness, I won't do it.
The Lord will see me through.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.751
10,000 roubles.

10:37.084 --> 10:38.292
20,000.

10:39.292 --> 10:41.292
Done. Let's go.

10:47.459 --> 10:48.459
Ohh!

10:48.542 --> 10:50.667
What the fuck?

10:50.792 --> 10:55.959
What fucking brainless fire-safety
fucking idiot put that there?

10:57.126 --> 10:59.626
Now we need a new conductor.
Let's go.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.001
Which one's your father in?

11:10.876 --> 11:12.917
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
Follow me.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.042
Open up!

11:16.876 --> 11:18.209
Let's get these on the bus.

11:18.292 --> 11:21.709
Keep it moving!
We've still got things to do!

11:21.834 --> 11:22.917
Come on, move!

11:36.584 --> 11:38.167
I love you. I love you.

11:38.292 --> 11:41.417
Now, you say whatever
you have to say to them. You say it.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.126
Oh, God.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.917
Hello. Hi.

11:46.376 --> 11:47.709
Deepest apologies, sir.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.334
Radio Moscow requests your
presence immediately, please.

11:50.459 --> 11:54.959
You're Moscow's finest and nearest
conductor, so... we must hurry.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.792
I rather enjoyed your reference
to Polnikov this evening.

12:04.876 --> 12:07.376
Stalin looked like he was
gonna split your head open.

12:07.501 --> 12:12.209
"What became of Polnikov and
Trotsky? I was a huge fan of his."

12:12.334 --> 12:13.876
"I miss the Tsar."

12:14.001 --> 12:17.001
I'm exhausted. I can't remember
who's alive and who isn't.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.542
Georgy, when you go home,
make sure your wife writes down

12:19.667 --> 12:21.501
everything you think
you said tonight.

12:21.626 --> 12:23.977
All right, this way in the morning
you know what you're dealing with.

12:24.001 --> 12:25.459
That's Khrushchev's Law.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.709
Good night, comrades. Long live
the Communist Party of Lenin-Stalin.

12:29.251 --> 12:31.126
Long live John Wayne
and John Ford.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.167
Goodbye, Molotov, old friend.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.417
Goodbye forever.

12:38.209 --> 12:39.584
Yeah. On the list.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.751
It would be simpler and cheaper

12:41.834 --> 12:43.459
if they just drove
straight into a river.

12:45.084 --> 12:46.251
Sweet dreams.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.126
Good night.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.334
Night.

13:04.667 --> 13:05.959
People in off the streets.

13:06.042 --> 13:07.167
Just this way.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.417
I don't think any of these people
have ever heard of Mozart.

13:40.126 --> 13:41.584
<i>I made a joke about the farmers.</i>

13:41.917 --> 13:44.376
- Did Stalin laugh?
- Yeah.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.251
I made a joke about the navy.

13:48.459 --> 13:50.876
- No laugh.
- No more navy jokes.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.459
Good evening.

13:52.584 --> 13:54.126
Get this lot checked in.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.501
Good. Nice.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.417
Long live Stalin!

14:01.501 --> 14:03.459
Long live Stalin!

14:27.626 --> 14:29.792
- Shouldn't we check it?
- No time.

14:31.209 --> 14:34.084
If it's not okay, then Stalin's men
will chop you into dog meat.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.167
Thank you.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.834
Move, move, move, move, move.
Excuse me. Thank you.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.626
I have it. I have it.

14:43.459 --> 14:48.792
I have the recording. I just had to
get a new sleeve, a white one.

14:48.876 --> 14:50.459
The delay has been logged.

14:50.584 --> 14:53.292
I wish to convey a special
message from my heart.

14:53.376 --> 14:56.251
I wish to convey this recording
to Comrade Stalin.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.126
I want Comrade Stalin to know

14:58.209 --> 15:00.542
the full intensity
of my feelings for him.

15:01.126 --> 15:02.834
No, this is unauthorised narcissism.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.042
No.

15:05.459 --> 15:09.126
The item is now in my possession...
after a significant delay.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.459
Note the time.

15:39.501 --> 15:41.709
What took you so long?
You fucking walk here?

16:05.501 --> 16:07.376
<i>Josef Vissarionovich Stalin,</i>

16:07.459 --> 16:10.292
<i>you have betrayed our nation
and destroyed its people.</i>

16:10.876 --> 16:14.084
<i>I pray for your end,
and ask the Lord to forgive you.</i>

16:14.209 --> 16:15.542
<i>Tyrant.</i>

16:22.126 --> 16:25.209
Oh, fuck. Fuck...

16:33.834 --> 16:35.209
Should we investigate?

16:35.584 --> 16:38.626
Should you shut the fuck up
before you get us both killed?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.126
Good morning.

16:54.709 --> 16:55.834
Well?

16:59.626 --> 17:01.251
Comrade Stalin?

17:02.251 --> 17:03.917
Comrade Stalin?

17:07.334 --> 17:08.709
I just need some names.

17:09.334 --> 17:12.251
Each name you give me
is one less bit of you I'll cut off.

17:12.376 --> 17:14.376
Enter.

17:16.251 --> 17:20.251
Sorry to interrupt, Comrade Minister.
It's Comrade Stalin.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.459
Oh, don't worry about him.
Those ears are full of blood anyway.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.376
Comrade Stalin is very ill.

17:28.084 --> 17:29.209
Very ill?

17:29.959 --> 17:31.001
Yes.

17:32.334 --> 17:33.459
Uh-huh.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.501
- You, carry on.
- Of course.

17:38.292 --> 17:41.251
Tell them Beria is on his way.

17:41.959 --> 17:46.626
They are to touch nothing,
call no-one. Understood?

17:47.376 --> 17:49.376
Tell me you understand
my instructions.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.542
I understand your instructions.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.001
Good.

17:53.126 --> 17:55.959
Shh, shh.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.042
What's your name, Lieutenant?

17:59.626 --> 18:01.042
S-Slimonov, sir.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.584
S-Slimonov?

18:03.792 --> 18:05.584
Be here when I g-get back.

18:07.459 --> 18:09.459
Long live Stalin!

18:13.542 --> 18:16.501
- Abramovsky still holding out?
- Yeah. He's close, though.

18:16.751 --> 18:18.376
He was close yesterday.

18:18.501 --> 18:19.792
Long live Stalin!

18:19.876 --> 18:21.501
Have his wife move into the next cell

18:21.584 --> 18:23.167
and start working
on her until he talks.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.667
Make it noisy.

18:24.792 --> 18:28.001
Shame. Mrs Abramovsky's been
most cooperative so far.

18:29.292 --> 18:32.126
Some women will do anything
to get their husbands released.

18:32.251 --> 18:34.334
Yeah, and she did everything.

18:34.459 --> 18:37.417
I thank the Union for bringing me
so many devoted wives

18:37.501 --> 18:39.459
who fuck like sewing machines.

18:39.876 --> 18:41.042
Glasses.

18:43.626 --> 18:45.376
To his dacha. Urgently.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.251
Tanks, farmers, navy,

18:55.376 --> 18:56.792
grenade: funny.

18:56.917 --> 18:59.876
Beria, tomato, pocket: funny. Horse...

19:00.001 --> 19:01.792
- Funny?
- ...slippers: question mark.

19:01.876 --> 19:04.501
- Farmers, horse again, navy...
- There were no whores.

19:04.876 --> 19:08.209
What are you writing?
Oh, "horse". Is this in code?

19:08.334 --> 19:10.792
This is your drunken nonsense,
not mine. Don't blame my notes.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.459
"Molotov C-H-H-H..."

19:13.584 --> 19:15.167
Was I stuttering? What is that?

19:15.292 --> 19:16.959
Molotov...

19:18.209 --> 19:20.792
Oh. It's Molotov...

19:22.167 --> 19:24.167
- He's on the list.
- Poor Molotov.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.501
First his wife, now him.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.626
Georgy is off in a hurry somewhere.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.251
Something's happening.

19:33.001 --> 19:34.126
Hello?

19:34.584 --> 19:35.626
What?

19:35.709 --> 19:36.959
Get my trousers.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.334
Just get my... No, not you.

19:39.459 --> 19:41.292
Who's there? Is Beria there?

19:41.417 --> 19:42.876
Never mind. I'll be right there.

19:43.584 --> 19:45.518
Your trousers. Your trousers.
Here are your trousers.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.209
- Okay, okay.
- Let me take your pyjamas.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.959
No, there's no time. Get my
shoes, please, Nina, my shoes.

19:51.042 --> 19:52.876
- Your shirt.
- Send me a shirt and tie.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.834
Were you on duty
when he was found?

20:12.959 --> 20:15.501
- Yes, sir.
- No-one is to come in. Understood?

20:15.626 --> 20:17.001
Yes, sir.

20:17.084 --> 20:18.501
Remain at your stations.

20:22.667 --> 20:23.917
Oh, God.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.376
They told me
not to get a doctor.

20:30.501 --> 20:31.959
You did well, Matryona Petrovna.

20:32.084 --> 20:33.959
The Central Committee
will handle things now.

20:34.209 --> 20:36.876
- So they'll get a doctor?
- There are procedures in place.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.209
- So you'll get a doctor?
- I am the doctor.

20:41.334 --> 20:42.917
I'll see to everything. Come on.

20:46.209 --> 20:47.459
Go on. He'll be fine.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.584
Smells like a Baku pisshouse in here.

20:55.626 --> 20:56.667
Greetings, by the way.

21:01.001 --> 21:02.126
Oh, shit.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.667
Uh-huh.

21:27.209 --> 21:29.042
Oh, come on. Fuck!

21:48.959 --> 21:51.709
Khrustalyov! Khrustalyov!

21:55.834 --> 21:57.542
- Take the papers.
- Let them go.

21:57.709 --> 21:59.685
Take the papers or I'll cut
your eyes out one at a time

21:59.709 --> 22:00.917
so you can watch it happening!

22:01.042 --> 22:02.376
- Drop it.
- Take them!

22:27.209 --> 22:28.626
Come in.

22:33.834 --> 22:35.209
Oh, my God.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.042
Is this...
I'm guessing that this is...

22:43.209 --> 22:45.792
Yeah, he's feeling unwell, clearly.

22:47.584 --> 22:48.792
He's irreplaceable.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.626
How can we possibly...

22:55.417 --> 22:57.834
All right, we must
think of the people.

22:59.376 --> 23:01.876
As Acting General Secretary,
I must step up.

23:02.001 --> 23:07.084
I must... I must take his place
while he's... on the floor.

23:07.209 --> 23:09.042
But you just said
he's irreplaceable.

23:09.167 --> 23:11.042
Irreplaceable. Take his place as in

23:11.167 --> 23:12.959
assembling the Central Committee,
of course.

23:13.042 --> 23:16.917
Good. I was testing you.
Get used to that sort of challenge.

23:18.584 --> 23:20.042
So, what next, boss?

23:21.626 --> 23:23.584
We should...
We should get a doctor.

23:24.501 --> 23:25.584
Yeah...

23:26.417 --> 23:27.834
Yes. If only we hadn't...

23:27.917 --> 23:30.060
put away all those highly
competent doctors for treason.

23:30.084 --> 23:31.792
- You remember?
- Yes, I do. I do.

23:31.876 --> 23:34.084
You know,
they were plotting to poison him.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.001
Yes, that's right.
You collected the evidence.

23:36.084 --> 23:38.834
Yes, I did. I did.
Are you still testing me?

23:43.917 --> 23:46.542
Oh, this is calamity!

23:47.417 --> 23:48.501
Calamity!

23:48.876 --> 23:51.209
Ah! Ohh...

23:51.626 --> 23:53.542
Oh.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.917
Oh-oh-oh, no!

23:56.459 --> 24:00.876
Oh, he's on the floor.
He's on the fucking floor!

24:01.001 --> 24:02.667
Okay, be careful, careful.

24:02.792 --> 24:06.209
Oh, what to do? Oh, what to do?

24:06.292 --> 24:08.584
My heart, it feels sick...

24:10.542 --> 24:12.167
like it's going into battle.

24:23.417 --> 24:24.751
Which doctor have you called?

24:24.834 --> 24:26.709
Well, the subject's currently
under discussion.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.209
As Acting General Secretary,

24:28.292 --> 24:30.626
I think that, well,
the Committee should decide.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.084
The Committee?

24:32.167 --> 24:36.126
But our actual General Secretary
is lying in a puddle of indignity.

24:36.209 --> 24:39.376
I mean, I think he's saying,
"Get me a doctor now."

24:39.501 --> 24:42.667
No, I don't agree. I think
we should wait until we're quorate.

24:42.792 --> 24:46.084
Quorate? The room
is only 75 percent conscious!

24:46.209 --> 24:49.292
- Are you wearing pyjamas?
- Yeah. So?

24:49.459 --> 24:52.209
- Why?
- Because I act, Lavrenti.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.126
Decisively and with great speed.

24:54.251 --> 24:55.459
I said you'd be tested

24:55.584 --> 24:58.042
and now you're being tested
by a shouting man in pyjamas.

24:58.167 --> 25:00.792
Have you got a nappy
under those too? Too late for him.

25:00.876 --> 25:04.042
Out of my way, you fannies.

25:09.126 --> 25:10.126
Shit.

25:12.584 --> 25:15.626
Where's the big fella?

25:15.751 --> 25:17.334
Are we late?

25:18.792 --> 25:20.167
Sorry.

25:21.584 --> 25:24.209
He can't go, not like this.

25:24.501 --> 25:26.334
- Careful. Careful.
- Whoa, whoa.

25:26.459 --> 25:28.084
It's wet.

25:28.209 --> 25:31.376
- So, was Beria here first?
- Yeah, what do you think?

25:31.501 --> 25:33.542
This can't be happening.
This can't be fucking...

25:33.667 --> 25:35.584
No, that's wet. For God's sake.

25:35.709 --> 25:38.042
You got here quick, comrade.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.042
I didn't stop to put on cologne.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.834
Hey, watch the suit. Watch the suit.

25:41.959 --> 25:44.667
Compelling drama, gentlemen,
but we do need to get him into bed.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.167
- You take the head.
- Why?

25:46.251 --> 25:48.626
- You're Acting General Secretary.
- I would be honoured.

25:49.251 --> 25:51.167
It's just me here
kneeling in the piss, yeah?

25:51.292 --> 25:53.792
- Why don't you...
- But, there's piss...

25:53.917 --> 25:56.292
- Come on.
- It is better. It's more balanced.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.292
Yeah? Well, you can pay
my laundry bill, then.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.667
You're not auditioning
for the Bolshoi.

26:01.751 --> 26:04.084
- Who are you, Nijinsky? Come on.
- I have a bad back.

26:04.376 --> 26:06.126
Too much social climbing, I expect.

26:06.251 --> 26:08.917
- The head is the heaviest part.
- All right, ready?

26:09.251 --> 26:11.084
- Three, two...
- Two.

26:11.209 --> 26:12.251
One.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.501
Lift. Jesus.

26:15.376 --> 26:17.751
- God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:17.876 --> 26:19.751
- To me.
- Turn, turn, turn.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.334
- This way. There we go.
- Yeah, all right.

26:22.417 --> 26:23.709
Are you wearing pyjamas?

26:23.792 --> 26:25.376
Can we just stop twittering

26:25.459 --> 26:27.417
like fishwives at the market
and concentrate?

26:27.501 --> 26:30.751
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Open the door. Back up, back up.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.251
No, no, that way.

26:32.376 --> 26:34.626
Go. Right, go.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.272
- Get back to the kitchen now!
- Move!

26:36.417 --> 26:37.626
- Move!
- Now. Now.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.292
He's heavier than I thought he'd be.

26:40.376 --> 26:43.376
- Do you think Stalin's too heavy?
- No, it's a compliment.

26:43.459 --> 26:44.959
- Gold is heavy.
- Well, you'd know.

26:45.084 --> 26:47.167
You've looted enough of it,
you saucy little pirate.

26:47.292 --> 26:49.167
Get back in the dining room!

26:49.751 --> 26:52.376
- Right, this one. This way, this way.
- Stop using his feet.

26:52.501 --> 26:54.167
- I'm sorry.
- Can we just put him down?

26:54.292 --> 26:56.626
- I'm absolutely soaked.
- Lamp. Lamp, lamp.

26:56.751 --> 26:59.084
- Out of the way.
- No, wait a minute... move, move.

26:59.209 --> 27:01.209
Mikoyan,
move out of the way, quickly.

27:01.334 --> 27:04.126
- I can't, I can't.
- Fucking hell!

27:04.209 --> 27:06.876
- Fuck. Jesus Christ!
- Turn him over.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.459
Fuck me! Three fittings
I had for this suit. Three.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.459
He looks ready now.

27:14.584 --> 27:17.251
- I need a vodka.
- I need a wash.

27:17.376 --> 27:20.084
But we didn't drop him.
Well done, us.

27:20.209 --> 27:23.501
Oh, I still got fucking tomato
in my pocket.

27:23.626 --> 27:25.042
It's still funny.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.542
All right, comrades,
now that we're quorate,

27:28.709 --> 27:30.334
I propose we call a doctor.

27:30.459 --> 27:34.084
All the best doctors
are in the gulag, or dead.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.959
Yes, yes, because they tried
to kill the boss.

27:37.042 --> 27:41.626
So any doctor still in Moscow
is not a good doctor.

27:41.751 --> 27:46.751
What are people's thoughts
on getting a bad doctor?

27:46.917 --> 27:49.626
What the fuck are you
talking about? That's mad.

27:49.792 --> 27:52.501
What if he recovers
and finds out?

27:52.709 --> 27:55.584
Well, if he recovers,
then we got a good doctor,

27:55.917 --> 27:58.542
and if he doesn't recover,
then we didn't, but he won't know.

27:59.126 --> 28:00.584
What was the name of the...

28:00.709 --> 28:03.126
that woman who gave evidence
against the doctors?

28:04.167 --> 28:05.501
- Timashuk.
- Yes.

28:05.626 --> 28:08.126
She's got everything
we require for the situation.

28:08.292 --> 28:11.209
The location of all the remaining
doctors in the Moscow area,

28:11.334 --> 28:15.417
a proven desire to survive
and a talent for fellatio.

28:15.584 --> 28:17.376
Yeah, right, she gets my vote.

28:17.459 --> 28:19.917
Good. Let her find us
some doctors.

28:20.001 --> 28:23.792
Yeah, and if it goes badly,
we pin it all on Lady Suck Suck.

28:23.917 --> 28:26.042
- Then we shoot her.
- Yes, that would work.

28:26.167 --> 28:29.459
You see? We're better as a committee.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.584
Let's go.

28:53.251 --> 28:55.917
You have a nice long sleep, old man.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.709
I'll take it from here.

29:34.001 --> 29:36.251
That's him.
That's him there. There.

29:44.959 --> 29:47.209
Please, I've done nothing wrong.

29:47.334 --> 29:48.334
Take the stethoscope.

29:48.459 --> 29:51.542
Comrade Timashuk,
I retired six years ago.

29:51.626 --> 29:53.334
- Get that coat on him.
- Please, I...

29:53.792 --> 29:55.376
Look,
I can give you names.

29:55.459 --> 29:58.167
- Come on. Stop resisting.
- What about my dog?

29:58.251 --> 29:59.876
- This is appalling.
- Hurry up.

30:01.459 --> 30:02.584
Get him in the van.

30:03.376 --> 30:04.959
We found some old friends of yours.

30:05.626 --> 30:07.584
I've never met them
before in my life.

30:14.126 --> 30:16.084
So, Molotov's off the list.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.667
Yes, Beria's moving fast.

30:19.542 --> 30:21.126
But we can still outvote him.

30:21.292 --> 30:26.042
I always thought it would be you,
to fill Stalin's shoes, if I'm honest.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.459
Not Malenkov.

30:30.917 --> 30:32.834
Who knows the future
of the Union?

30:33.834 --> 30:36.667
Well, the Union
could really use change.

30:37.501 --> 30:39.501
Maybe some reforms
now that the old man...

30:39.626 --> 30:41.251
No, Nicky.

30:41.876 --> 30:44.042
Nobody needs factionalism.

30:45.042 --> 30:46.542
You want factionalism?

30:46.751 --> 30:49.501
What about those two, fucking
Abbott and Costello over there?

30:49.626 --> 30:51.126
Christ.

30:51.251 --> 30:54.501
When I piss, I try to make
eye contact with an officer.

30:54.626 --> 30:55.876
Ruins their day.

30:56.667 --> 30:59.751
When I piss, I try to piss
on an officer. Also ruins their day.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.751
We should keep an eye
on Kaganovich.

31:02.959 --> 31:05.251
Yeah, Khrushchev too,
his talking goat.

31:05.334 --> 31:08.709
Khrushchev. I spend my life
making people talk.

31:08.792 --> 31:11.292
I can't shut that gabbling idiot up.

31:12.584 --> 31:15.542
We need to assert our authority,
increase security in Moscow.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.542
We should get
Stalin's children here.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.876
Vasily will be lying face down
in a ditch full of vodka.

31:21.001 --> 31:23.584
- But Svetlana...
- The people love her.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.876
- I'm gonna get her in.
- Comrade ministers!

31:26.001 --> 31:30.001
- Svetlana is here!
- I'm here. I'm over here!

31:30.084 --> 31:32.209
- Svetlana!
- Svetlana!

31:32.292 --> 31:33.959
Shit. The race has started.

31:34.084 --> 31:37.626
All right, we need to start putting
together a plan. We need change.

31:37.751 --> 31:39.876
Put a halt to the arrests,
prison releases,

31:40.001 --> 31:41.417
maybe even reform the Church.

31:41.542 --> 31:43.542
How can you run and plot
at the same time?

31:43.667 --> 31:44.834
Hello! Svetlana!

31:44.959 --> 31:46.584
- They're trying to cut you off.
- Where?

31:46.667 --> 31:48.334
It's obvious. Svetlana!

31:48.417 --> 31:49.876
- Svetlana!
- Svetlana!

31:49.959 --> 31:52.001
- Oh, my darling.
- Where is he?

31:52.084 --> 31:54.251
- Where's my father? I would like...
- Oh, my dear.

31:54.334 --> 31:57.167
- I'm so sorry.
- I would like to see him.

31:57.251 --> 31:59.292
- Yes, of course.
- Where is he?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.334
We'll take you inside. He's in bed.

32:01.626 --> 32:03.792
God Almighty!
Look at that herb garden.

32:03.876 --> 32:05.018
Does nobody tend it any more?

32:05.042 --> 32:07.459
Do people no longer
eat herbs any more?

32:07.542 --> 32:08.959
Do they only eat weeds?

32:09.084 --> 32:11.268
- Come on, we'll take you to see him.
- Where is Vasily?

32:11.292 --> 32:13.167
- I will get your brother here.
- Most helpful.

32:13.292 --> 32:15.126
- All right.
- She wants Vasily.

32:15.251 --> 32:18.792
If Vasily is coming, granted,
we should probably have tea and buns.

32:18.876 --> 32:21.126
- We'll get some buns and some tea.
- Soak up the vodka.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.376
What?

32:25.501 --> 32:28.001
I saw you and Big Boy
out in the woods earlier.

32:28.084 --> 32:30.084
- Yeah.
- There's bears in there.

32:31.167 --> 32:33.001
You'd better watch your step, son.

32:33.209 --> 32:35.584
- Well, there's bears in here too.
- Hm?

32:37.959 --> 32:41.834
Come on, play! Play better!

32:41.917 --> 32:43.084
Urgh!

32:43.292 --> 32:44.876
Oh, Jesus.

32:46.001 --> 32:47.852
When we play Hungary,
are we allowed to use guns?

32:47.876 --> 32:50.084
These are the best
I could find since the plane crash.

32:50.209 --> 32:52.334
What plane crash?
There was never a plane crash.

32:52.459 --> 32:54.959
Was there a plane crash?
Soviet planes do not crash.

32:55.042 --> 32:57.459
And Stalin's son
does not fuck up.

32:58.751 --> 32:59.792
Christ!

32:59.917 --> 33:01.437
We have Bobrov.
He wasn't on the plane.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.542
What plane?

33:03.001 --> 33:04.084
Bobrov!

33:04.751 --> 33:07.001
- Go on. Hit it.
- No!

33:08.626 --> 33:11.459
He's terrified, practically leaving
a trail of yellow ice!

33:11.542 --> 33:14.292
You're the coach. Coach them so
they're as good as the dead team was.

33:14.376 --> 33:17.209
- Or I'll have you killed, okay?
- Apologies. And agreed.

33:17.334 --> 33:19.126
Or I'll just do it myself.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.334
Come on! Play on!

33:23.209 --> 33:25.126
Play through! Ignore me!

33:25.209 --> 33:28.626
Get it. Give it. Hit it.

33:29.167 --> 33:30.167
Vasily.

33:30.251 --> 33:32.626
Play better, you clattering fannies!

33:32.709 --> 33:33.917
Come.

33:34.001 --> 33:35.751
Oh, fuck!
Do they know about the crash?

33:35.917 --> 33:38.459
Give me a drink. I've got time
for a drink. Give me the flask.

33:38.542 --> 33:39.584
No, no.

33:42.251 --> 33:43.792
You are to come
to your father's dacha.

33:43.876 --> 33:45.268
The plane should never have taken off.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.292
Do you suppose
that just because I am who I am

33:47.376 --> 33:48.876
that I can predict an ice storm?

33:49.001 --> 33:51.792
Ice storm? Are you saying something's
happened to our national team?

33:51.876 --> 33:53.917
- Nothing's happened.
- What the fuck are you doing?

33:54.084 --> 33:56.417
My father will have you saddled
and ridden to Siberia,

33:56.542 --> 33:58.084
you rude fucking pies.

33:59.459 --> 34:02.292
These are good doctors,
my dear. They're the best.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.209
They look like mental patients.

34:05.042 --> 34:07.522
Are they going to sing for us?
Why are they standing in a line?

34:08.333 --> 34:09.417
Let's have it.

34:17.251 --> 34:20.917
Following a group assessment
of Comrade Stalin,

34:21.001 --> 34:24.417
we've arrived
at the unanimous conclusion,

34:24.542 --> 34:26.167
based on a collective finding...

34:26.251 --> 34:27.708
Please put him out of his misery.

34:28.626 --> 34:31.542
Comrade Stalin has had
a cerebral haemorrhage.

34:31.626 --> 34:33.626
The right side of his body
is paralysed.

34:33.708 --> 34:34.792
Oh, God.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.208
What is the chance of recovery?

34:38.333 --> 34:39.751
It is hard to say.

34:42.251 --> 34:46.751
Relax. I'm not gonna kiss you.
Will he recover, yes or no?

34:51.292 --> 34:52.292
No.

34:52.376 --> 34:53.751
- No?
- No.

34:55.958 --> 34:57.001
It's over.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.334
It's over!

34:59.417 --> 35:02.709
I want a second opinion.
I don't trust these creatures to...

35:02.876 --> 35:05.542
- I mean, how old are you?
- I'm 29.

35:05.626 --> 35:07.376
That's a lie. How old are you?

35:07.459 --> 35:08.626
You look dead.

35:09.584 --> 35:11.959
I know people in Stalingrad.
I know people in Moscow.

35:12.084 --> 35:16.417
No, no, no. We have all the doctors.
There is no other opinion.

35:16.542 --> 35:18.834
- Oh, God.
- And so it begins.

35:18.917 --> 35:19.917
Oh, God!

35:20.001 --> 35:22.667
I cry for Stalin.
I cry for all the people.

35:22.751 --> 35:25.001
- I cry for the...
- Courage.

35:26.042 --> 35:28.792
Courage, little bird.
We're here for you.

35:31.334 --> 35:33.209
Most of all, we cry for you,

35:33.292 --> 35:35.626
little... bird.

35:35.792 --> 35:39.334
We offer our tears,
though not as a gift, of course.

35:41.709 --> 35:43.584
Oh, God.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.751
I want Moscow cauterised, now.

35:53.834 --> 35:55.876
<i>Cut off the city.</i>

35:56.001 --> 36:00.251
- Moscow's closed. No-one gets in.
- Especially you.

36:00.334 --> 36:03.042
NKVD to displace army officers
at every station.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.792
Army back to barracks.
We're taking over.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.459
Remove Molotov from that last list.

36:15.334 --> 36:16.501
Implement our lists.

36:17.459 --> 36:18.501
New lists.

36:21.376 --> 36:22.376
New lists.

36:22.459 --> 36:25.084
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches.

36:25.501 --> 36:27.167
- New lists.
- New lists.

36:27.251 --> 36:28.542
- New lists.
- New lists.

36:28.626 --> 36:30.251
New lists.

36:43.292 --> 36:44.876
Trophy hunting, comrade?

36:44.959 --> 36:48.209
Oh, Svetlana. No, no. I was...

36:48.334 --> 36:51.459
We were just about to make a toast
to your father's health

36:51.584 --> 36:55.876
and I know he kept
some fine vodka here somewhere.

36:56.084 --> 36:58.542
Well, better you find it
than my brother.

36:58.626 --> 37:00.542
Ah, yes. Vasily.

37:01.251 --> 37:03.167
I got a hold of him
and he's on his way.

37:04.251 --> 37:05.959
- Oh...
- Svetlana, I wanted to...

37:06.042 --> 37:09.959
There was one day when my brother
just rode a pig through here.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.542
- That must have been messy.
- It was terribly messy.

37:13.626 --> 37:15.917
And my father was so cross.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.334
Papa just chased him
around the room in a circle.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.667
Right here around this sofa,
just there, look.

37:20.751 --> 37:25.251
Yes, I wanted to let you know
that no matter what happens,

37:25.334 --> 37:30.084
I will never ever let any harm
come to you or your brother.

37:30.167 --> 37:33.042
- Who said anything about harm?
- No, that's what I'm saying.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.751
You know somebody
wants to harm us?

37:34.876 --> 37:36.596
- Tell me. I demand to know.
- If someone...

37:36.667 --> 37:38.501
No. I should not have used
the word "harm".

37:38.584 --> 37:40.544
Yes. But you keep mentioning
the word "harm". Why?

37:41.209 --> 37:47.209
If anyone tries to... you,
they'll have to get through me first.

37:52.417 --> 37:53.959
My father's going to die.

37:54.042 --> 37:56.001
I'm going to have you
to look after me.

37:56.792 --> 37:59.084
I mean, I may as well
just shoot myself like Mother.

37:59.917 --> 38:03.501
- Svetlana, we need to be strong.
- Who would put a lamp on a chair?

38:07.917 --> 38:11.417
We need to be strong
and never afraid.

38:11.501 --> 38:14.959
- I wasn't afraid. Now I am afraid.
- Don't be, because if any harm...

38:15.042 --> 38:16.209
God, I actually...

38:16.292 --> 38:17.518
can't believe you said that again.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.209
Quick! The boss is back!

38:19.292 --> 38:20.709
- Ohh!
- Come on!

38:23.376 --> 38:25.834
- Papa!
- A miracle.

38:26.001 --> 38:27.251
Stalin is invincible.

38:27.417 --> 38:29.959
The boss has shipped death
back to the salt mine.

38:30.084 --> 38:32.334
What's happening?
This is impossible...

38:34.084 --> 38:36.501
and... and... and wonderful.

38:38.001 --> 38:40.126
- He's pointing...
- What is it, Chief?

38:40.376 --> 38:43.167
Maybe he's appointing his successor.

38:43.251 --> 38:44.292
Do you think?

38:46.167 --> 38:47.376
- No.
- Maybe not.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.018
- What's he...
- It's the painting.

38:50.042 --> 38:52.834
- He's pointing at the painting.
- Hold on. You know what he's saying?

38:52.917 --> 38:55.001
He is saying, "I am the lamb."

38:55.417 --> 38:56.459
Huh?

38:56.542 --> 39:00.459
"I am the lamb and you, you,
my children, have given me life."

39:00.584 --> 39:01.626
Yes!

39:02.334 --> 39:07.709
Or the lamb is the people
and the milk is socialism.

39:07.792 --> 39:08.917
Maybe he's the milk.

39:09.417 --> 39:10.876
Maybe you're the tit.

39:10.959 --> 39:14.251
- Maybe he just wants a drink.
- A drink of milk.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.917
- Possible.
- Milk here! Immediately!

39:17.042 --> 39:20.667
- Not milk. Water. Water.
- And not in a horn. In a glass.

39:22.417 --> 39:23.667
So, Top Boy.

39:23.792 --> 39:26.292
You had your hair
fucking embalmed or something?

39:27.376 --> 39:28.751
I owe it to him and the people.

39:29.917 --> 39:32.001
- There's going to be photos.
- Oh, right.

39:33.459 --> 39:35.917
You're a hero, Comrade Lukomsky.

39:36.001 --> 39:39.917
This sometimes happens and I...

39:40.751 --> 39:43.167
I'm incredibly pleased.

39:46.792 --> 39:48.042
I won't forget it.

39:58.584 --> 39:59.584
Comrade.

40:00.917 --> 40:03.667
We've remained at our post
as you ordered.

40:04.334 --> 40:06.959
Might we respectfully
stand down from our position?

40:07.042 --> 40:08.084
Beria...

40:09.459 --> 40:10.584
...he's dead.

40:34.501 --> 40:36.667
- Oh, Jesus!
- Fuck my boots!

40:36.751 --> 40:38.459
Oh, my God.

40:38.542 --> 40:40.876
I'm sorry, boss.
I wish I could take it for you.

40:41.001 --> 40:44.751
Thick skull, you know. It's
an incredibly strong, hard skull.

40:44.834 --> 40:46.001
Shut up.

40:46.084 --> 40:47.667
We need to think about the Presidium.

40:47.792 --> 40:50.251
Yes, succession. We need to...

40:51.167 --> 40:53.917
Oh, fuck. That's his...

40:56.376 --> 40:57.709
Who organised the Wurlitzer?

40:57.792 --> 41:00.584
- It's a respirator.
- Did you use it?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.501
- No. It's American.
- It's what?

41:03.584 --> 41:05.542
- It's from his hospital.
- It was his idea.

41:05.667 --> 41:08.876
Let's just pretend these last
six sentences never happened.

41:08.959 --> 41:10.852
Because if they ever find out
that we brought in...

41:10.876 --> 41:13.667
What are you doing to my father,
you jackals? Murderers!

41:13.792 --> 41:16.084
- You'll kill him!
- Vasily, your father is dead.

41:16.209 --> 41:19.334
You're dividing the spoils.
Leave his brain alone!

41:19.417 --> 41:20.876
- How old are you?
- I'm old.

41:20.959 --> 41:23.126
You're not old!
You're not even a person!

41:23.251 --> 41:26.167
You're a testicle!
You're made mostly of hair!

41:26.251 --> 41:28.042
- Vasily...
- Here's your fucking harvest.

41:28.126 --> 41:29.626
Here it is.

41:29.709 --> 41:31.834
Leave the man alone! I will not...

41:32.876 --> 41:34.876
No! Don't let him shoot!

41:34.959 --> 41:37.167
- Just get the gun off him.
- Vasily!

41:37.251 --> 41:39.584
- Let her through.
- Remember what Papa said.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.949
They have a machine
filling his brain with American lies.

41:42.001 --> 41:43.459
"Wade gently through the river

41:43.542 --> 41:45.667
because there are snakes
and crocodiles."

41:45.751 --> 41:48.542
It's okay, Vasily.
Everything's gonna be fine.

41:48.626 --> 41:51.501
- This is not exactly fine, is it?
- No, well, not exactly fine.

41:51.626 --> 41:53.143
My father's lying there
with his head open.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.917
Yes, your father is dead.
Your brother is shooting a gun.

41:56.001 --> 41:57.251
It's not fine. You're right.

41:57.376 --> 41:58.584
Come on. There we go.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.751
You have all made
a deadly mistake.

42:07.376 --> 42:09.959
- Excuse me.
- That's right. Off you go, kitten.

42:31.959 --> 42:33.542
Oh, come on.

42:36.792 --> 42:39.501
- Just keep the gun away from him.
- I've got loads, anyway.

42:39.626 --> 42:41.126
Have you forgotten
how to salute?

42:41.209 --> 42:43.376
- No, sir.
- Then salute me.

42:45.334 --> 42:47.292
Now, let that be a warning.

42:48.084 --> 42:50.876
"Be strong," I hear my father say.

42:51.126 --> 42:52.167
Come on, chop, chop.

42:52.251 --> 42:53.459
Beria's picked you out.

42:54.917 --> 42:56.001
Just do as he says.

42:56.126 --> 43:00.126
- My car is right this way.
- No, no. She'll be happier with us.

43:00.209 --> 43:02.209
Okay, but we need to go. Let's go.

43:03.459 --> 43:05.126
- See you in Moscow.
- See you.

43:08.251 --> 43:09.584
Ah, nice.

43:17.834 --> 43:21.084
We need to go through first!
No, let us go first!

43:36.542 --> 43:37.584
Go, go, go!

43:45.001 --> 43:46.042
Go!

43:48.334 --> 43:50.209
Shit.
What, are we last now? Come on.

44:12.959 --> 44:15.292
Comrades, we share your grief.

44:15.376 --> 44:18.209
You will assemble outside
for further instructions.

44:18.292 --> 44:21.251
All staff into the transport.
Yes, that's it, hurry up.

44:21.334 --> 44:23.626
Come on, get a move on.
In the transports, please.

44:23.709 --> 44:26.959
Where the fuck
did she come from? Get her out!

44:27.084 --> 44:28.709
Gently with that, will you?
Hurry up.

44:30.292 --> 44:32.292
That's it, everything out.

44:38.334 --> 44:40.626
Lookalikes.
I think their contract's up.

44:40.834 --> 44:41.834
This way.

44:43.959 --> 44:47.876
- You, come with me.
- But I don't understand.

44:49.501 --> 44:51.209
Come on. Just this way.

44:51.292 --> 44:52.292
You can stand down.

44:52.834 --> 44:53.834
Food in the kitchen.

45:01.667 --> 45:02.876
Halt!

45:03.042 --> 45:04.667
Move them out!

45:10.126 --> 45:11.917
Last one! Move it out!

45:29.501 --> 45:30.584
<i>Hello again.</i>

45:32.042 --> 45:33.042
There you are.

45:35.709 --> 45:36.876
You're very quiet.

45:41.001 --> 45:43.709
See the little birch in the meadow.

45:44.917 --> 45:48.126
See the leaves dancing
when the wind blows.

45:50.042 --> 45:51.084
No?

45:51.792 --> 45:55.751
Well, come on, your voice was once
so beautiful, Polina Molotova.

45:58.084 --> 46:00.292
Oh, yes, sorry, meant to say.

46:01.501 --> 46:02.709
Stalin's dead.

46:04.167 --> 46:07.251
No. The Stalin?

46:08.584 --> 46:10.209
Our Stalin?

46:11.292 --> 46:13.834
Yeah, your Stalin.

46:15.501 --> 46:16.667
The one who put you here.

46:18.292 --> 46:19.292
Come on.

46:20.417 --> 46:23.751
Let's smarten you up
for Comrade Molotov.

46:24.126 --> 46:27.001
Good girl. Come on.

46:28.459 --> 46:32.251
Oh, sorry, darling. Work.
I'll make it up to you.

46:32.709 --> 46:35.251
Fetch the mattress
and have her washed.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.334
Okay.

46:36.876 --> 46:38.459
Right, get in there. Go on.

46:39.292 --> 46:40.917
Right, with me. Come on.

46:41.001 --> 46:44.501
All right, jug, rug, flowers.
Right, grab that.

46:46.292 --> 46:48.501
- S-Slimonov, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

46:48.584 --> 46:50.709
See you I-later, S-Slimonov.

46:51.501 --> 46:52.501
Come on.

46:56.167 --> 46:59.167
Bought you a lovely new dress,
a nice dress.

47:22.917 --> 47:24.459
Oh, God.

47:27.334 --> 47:31.167
Christ. You look like you're about
to be bulldozed into a lime pit.

47:31.292 --> 47:32.501
Need your toilet.

47:36.917 --> 47:39.126
Do you want me to hold back your hair?

47:39.251 --> 47:41.126
Polina always used to do that for me.

47:41.584 --> 47:42.917
Oh, no. Nothing's coming up.

47:43.709 --> 47:45.709
Futile gesture.

47:45.792 --> 47:50.751
Listen, I wanted to invite you
to tomorrow's Committee meeting.

47:50.959 --> 47:51.959
Meeting?

47:53.376 --> 47:55.709
What meeting?
Why didn't I know about a meeting?

48:02.792 --> 48:05.584
Stalin and Beria put you on a list.

48:07.959 --> 48:09.001
Stalin?

48:11.209 --> 48:14.626
Oh, I must have wronged him so badly.
What did I do?

48:14.792 --> 48:18.792
No, nothing. Don't you see?
Beria, he wants you out.

48:19.459 --> 48:21.219
Now, I've been talking
with Comrade Bulganin.

48:21.292 --> 48:22.292
No. No.

48:22.376 --> 48:23.893
I think he's right.
We can outvote them.

48:23.917 --> 48:26.376
No, no. This is factionalism.
Stalin didn't like factionalism.

48:26.459 --> 48:28.084
Oh, Stalin is dead!

48:29.084 --> 48:32.792
I've seen inside of him.
For fuck's sake, we have to act.

48:32.876 --> 48:35.209
I can't believe he's gone.

48:36.709 --> 48:38.417
Ohh...

48:44.501 --> 48:46.876
You have to wait for it to fill up.

48:48.167 --> 48:50.167
Fucking apartments.

48:51.709 --> 48:52.792
Listen to me.

48:53.542 --> 48:55.876
Beria had Polina killed.

48:56.959 --> 48:59.209
Now, surely you must have wanted to...

48:59.292 --> 49:01.959
Act against the party? Me?

49:02.084 --> 49:03.584
- No?
- No, never.

49:03.667 --> 49:04.792
- Really?
- No.

49:04.876 --> 49:06.626
- Not once?
- Not once.

49:06.709 --> 49:09.501
Hello? Anyone home?

49:09.584 --> 49:11.917
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

49:12.834 --> 49:14.376
We were just chatting.

49:14.459 --> 49:16.209
About Polina.

49:17.126 --> 49:20.251
- Well, well, would you believe it?
- Treacherous sow.

49:21.542 --> 49:24.417
Or a wronged woman who was framed.

49:24.542 --> 49:26.167
No, no. She was a criminal.

49:26.792 --> 49:27.834
I'm glad she's dead.

49:28.417 --> 49:31.376
Right, because,
well, she betrayed the party.

49:31.459 --> 49:34.084
- She plotted against Stalin.
- No, Nicky. False narrative.

49:34.167 --> 49:36.792
- No, no, she was a parasite.
- She <i>was</i> a parasite.

49:36.917 --> 49:41.501
She betrayed all of us, and, in fact,
the evidence was flimsy.

49:41.626 --> 49:44.584
There were no witnesses.
And look. Polina's back.

49:44.667 --> 49:46.459
Is it really you?

49:46.876 --> 49:51.042
Oh, my Polina.
Oh, I can't believe it.

49:51.126 --> 49:52.917
Oh, look, everyone, look.

49:53.001 --> 49:56.417
- My little Polinka's back.
- I am back.

49:56.542 --> 49:59.584
I kept her safe for you, Vyacheslav.

49:59.667 --> 50:01.917
And I kept him safe for you, Polina.

50:02.042 --> 50:04.334
- I've got so much to tell you.
- Good.

50:04.417 --> 50:06.376
- I've bought a dog...
- Oh?

50:06.459 --> 50:08.292
So many changes to come.

50:09.834 --> 50:11.709
And you're gonna like
some of them, Nicky.

50:15.209 --> 50:16.667
It's great to have you back.

50:28.792 --> 50:30.126
Hello, my sweet.

50:39.251 --> 50:40.376
You're the parents?

50:43.001 --> 50:45.501
Thank you. You should go now.

50:50.417 --> 50:51.751
<i>We ready?</i>

50:52.834 --> 50:54.001
<i>Good.</i>

50:56.542 --> 50:58.667
Now, please don't go
until I say, okay?

51:00.751 --> 51:01.792
Did you hear me?

51:08.376 --> 51:09.501
Okay.

51:11.834 --> 51:13.834
Yes? It's good?

51:14.834 --> 51:16.876
I'd like to try one
with a faraway look.

51:19.084 --> 51:20.126
Comrade,

51:20.209 --> 51:23.501
I've scheduled some telephone calls
later with various members of the...

51:23.667 --> 51:25.417
I can't hear you.
Can you say that again?

51:25.542 --> 51:28.709
I'm sorry. I've scheduled
some telephone calls later with...

51:28.792 --> 51:30.959
- Then tell me later.
- Of course.

51:31.042 --> 51:33.917
Mr Karloff, what an honour.
Love your work.

51:34.542 --> 51:37.876
Thinking of doing anything in colour?

51:38.209 --> 51:40.001
I need to talk to you about something.

51:40.126 --> 51:41.584
Would you please excuse me?

51:43.959 --> 51:45.167
I'll be right back.

51:50.417 --> 51:53.334
Don't you ever... ever...

51:54.459 --> 51:56.042
humiliate me again in front of...

51:56.834 --> 51:59.709
I am the General Secretary
of the Soviet Union.

51:59.792 --> 52:01.501
Apologies. A line has been crossed.

52:01.584 --> 52:04.167
It is my duty to look good
for the people.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.584
- Of course.
- Ah, comrade, apologies.

52:06.667 --> 52:09.084
I'm not gonna do the seating plan.
Give it to Blavatsky.

52:09.167 --> 52:12.042
- He's expert at sitting on his arse.
- Of course. Thank you.

52:12.126 --> 52:13.792
- The Committee meeting...
- Oh, yes, yes.

52:13.917 --> 52:18.501
Um, item one:
these lists and these arrests.

52:19.167 --> 52:22.001
I think we...
Should we take that down just a gear?

52:22.084 --> 52:23.459
Or hold off altogether?

52:25.459 --> 52:27.626
- Freeze them?
- Freeze, yes.

52:27.709 --> 52:29.834
Excellent thought.
Yes, we could freeze arrests.

52:29.917 --> 52:32.042
We could even release
some low-level prisoners.

52:32.167 --> 52:35.876
Fuck me. I mean... I mean, yes.

52:35.959 --> 52:37.626
But what would the old man...

52:37.751 --> 52:42.376
Oh, Stalin... Stalin destroyed
the status quo and he built a new one.

52:42.459 --> 52:45.084
The changes he made
were both radical and popular.

52:45.167 --> 52:47.209
- Liberalisation would be radical.
- Popular.

52:47.334 --> 52:49.042
- Radical.
- And popular.

52:49.126 --> 52:51.959
I will deal with whatever horseshit

52:52.042 --> 52:53.376
you have presently.

52:53.459 --> 52:55.959
- Actually, I'd like you to see this.
- Come on through.

52:56.667 --> 53:00.667
You remember that famous photo
of Stalin and the little girl?

53:00.751 --> 53:01.792
Yes.

53:01.876 --> 53:05.417
Well, I was thinking
a photo of, you and the girl.

53:05.501 --> 53:06.792
Continuity.

53:07.251 --> 53:10.459
And this way we're showing Stalin's
humanity moving forward, right?

53:10.542 --> 53:11.667
Yeah.

53:12.626 --> 53:14.917
I'm sorry about all that.
Find the girl.

53:15.001 --> 53:16.751
- We should head to the Committee.
- We are.

53:21.459 --> 53:23.917
So I'll outline the releases
under Article 31.

53:24.001 --> 53:25.709
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

53:26.501 --> 53:30.292
Please, understand that this
is not some cynical ploy.

53:30.376 --> 53:33.376
I mean, these reforms
are correct reforms.

53:33.459 --> 53:34.501
Totally understood.

53:37.334 --> 53:38.584
Are you wearing a corset?

53:42.084 --> 53:44.834
It's a girdle. I have a bad back.

53:46.167 --> 53:48.917
It's functional. It's not cosmetic.

53:49.001 --> 53:50.126
You wear it well.

53:52.042 --> 53:54.709
Let's make this
a test of your discretion, shall we?

53:54.792 --> 53:56.376
Of course. Of course.

54:05.334 --> 54:07.435
- So, in accordance...
- I call this meeting to order.

54:07.459 --> 54:08.792
My apologies.

54:09.542 --> 54:13.584
So, in accordance with his will,
I propose Comrade Malenkov

54:13.667 --> 54:15.393
be named Chairman
of the Council of Ministers

54:15.417 --> 54:17.417
and General Secretary of the Party.

54:17.834 --> 54:20.167
And I propose Comrade Beria

54:20.251 --> 54:23.042
for First Vice-Chairman,
Council of Ministers.

54:23.126 --> 54:25.501
So, let's take a vote.
Those in favour?

54:25.584 --> 54:27.292
Those are two separate proposals.

54:27.376 --> 54:30.042
I suggest we vote one at a time.
Those in favour?

54:30.209 --> 54:32.667
I'm unsure of what's being proposed.

54:32.751 --> 54:34.834
I just said what was being proposed.
I just said it.

54:34.959 --> 54:36.834
And you're being obstructionist.

54:36.917 --> 54:39.501
Comrade Beria is busy
combining his role

54:39.584 --> 54:41.709
as Minister for both
Interior and Security.

54:41.834 --> 54:43.876
Wouldn't it be kinder if someone else

54:43.959 --> 54:45.626
carried the happy burden
of Vice-Chairman?

54:45.709 --> 54:47.389
I thank Comrade Khrushchev
for his concern,

54:47.501 --> 54:50.167
but I'm perfectly capable
of doing two things at once.

54:50.251 --> 54:53.542
- Well, it's three things.
- Should we bring in an abacus?

54:53.626 --> 54:57.334
All right, let's move to a vote
on both proposals.

54:57.417 --> 55:00.626
All right? First me as... you know,

55:00.709 --> 55:03.126
and Comrade Beria as Vice-Chairman.

55:03.209 --> 55:04.292
All those in favour?

55:08.042 --> 55:09.126
Carried...

55:10.542 --> 55:12.417
u... nanimously.

55:12.501 --> 55:13.501
Right, next.

55:13.626 --> 55:16.084
We need someone
to take charge of the funeral.

55:16.167 --> 55:18.667
- What about Comrade Khrushchev?
- Where's this coming from?

55:18.751 --> 55:20.501
I formally propose Comrade Khrushchev

55:20.584 --> 55:22.384
be given the honour
of organising the funeral.

55:22.459 --> 55:24.227
What? Come on,
I don't have any time to do that.

55:24.251 --> 55:26.435
What if I can do three things at once,
you can at least do two.

55:26.459 --> 55:28.376
What do I know about funerals?

55:28.501 --> 55:30.376
You said you wanted
to honour his legacy.

55:30.459 --> 55:32.501
You told me last night
in the bathroom.

55:35.959 --> 55:38.959
- All those in... all those in favour?
- All those in favour?

55:39.042 --> 55:40.459
No, uh...

55:40.542 --> 55:43.542
Well, I think you'd be good,
actually, you know.

55:46.126 --> 55:47.709
Passed unanimously.

55:47.792 --> 55:50.167
Nicky Khrushchev, funeral director.
It suits you.

55:50.251 --> 55:51.876
- Yeah.
- It suits that face, anyway.

55:54.251 --> 55:57.501
- Comrade Beria.
- I propose a halt to deportations,

55:57.584 --> 56:01.792
the release of some existing detainees
under Article 31 and the suspension

56:01.876 --> 56:04.542
of all arrests that were officially
sanctioned three days ago.

56:04.626 --> 56:09.001
Whoa, whoa. That's like wiping
your arse on Stalin's final list.

56:09.084 --> 56:10.893
- No, no, no.
- This is demonstrably revisionist.

56:10.917 --> 56:15.126
Releasing people we arrested three
days ago will make us look cretinous.

56:15.709 --> 56:17.667
Listen, Stalin was misled.

56:17.792 --> 56:19.917
- We were misled.
- Really?

56:20.001 --> 56:23.126
Yes. So the people responsible
should be found and punished.

56:23.209 --> 56:26.042
Who are you kidding,
Lavrenti, yourself?

56:26.126 --> 56:29.542
We all knew what we were doing
when we signed those lists.

56:29.626 --> 56:35.042
Stalin destroyed the status quo...
and he rebuilt it.

56:36.501 --> 56:37.626
He was liberal.

56:37.751 --> 56:39.167
- Radical.
- He was radical.

56:39.251 --> 56:41.209
This is a blatant attempt
by Comrade Beria

56:41.334 --> 56:42.792
to buy the support of the public.

56:42.876 --> 56:45.796
I thought you were in favour of a more
liberal approach, Comrade Reformer.

56:45.876 --> 56:49.001
All those in favour
of pausing the arrests,

56:49.084 --> 56:51.667
of pausing the executions?

56:53.084 --> 56:54.167
All those in favour?

56:56.376 --> 57:02.084
Hmm. I've always been loyal to Stalin.
Always.

57:02.667 --> 57:05.334
And these arrests
were authorised by Stalin.

57:05.459 --> 57:08.084
But Stalin was also loyal
to the collective leadership,

57:08.167 --> 57:10.542
and that is true loyalty.

57:12.417 --> 57:16.334
However, he also had an iron will,
undeviating, strong.

57:16.417 --> 57:19.251
Should we not do the same
and stick to what we believed in?

57:21.084 --> 57:22.084
No.

57:23.001 --> 57:25.834
It is stronger still
to forge our own beliefs

57:25.917 --> 57:28.876
with the beliefs
of the collective leadership.

57:29.709 --> 57:32.542
Which I have now... done.

57:36.876 --> 57:39.626
Carried... unanimously. Thank you.

57:39.751 --> 57:41.334
I'll oversee the releases.

57:42.584 --> 57:45.042
We have loosened
the Union's great corset.

57:46.626 --> 57:49.917
Nicky, you've some bouquets
and swatches to look at.

57:50.001 --> 57:51.709
A funeral doesn't organise itself.

57:59.876 --> 58:02.292
- Long live Stalin.
- Stalin's dead. Malenkov's in charge.

58:02.376 --> 58:03.810
- Stop shooting.
- Long live Malenk...

58:03.834 --> 58:05.667
Amnesty effective immediately.

58:05.751 --> 58:08.917
Orders of Comrade Beria.
We're moving out. Let's go.

58:09.792 --> 58:11.126
Come on, let's go.

58:26.167 --> 58:27.417
Come on.

58:31.417 --> 58:32.709
Ahh...

58:32.792 --> 58:34.917
Oh, my God!

58:35.584 --> 58:37.834
Ohh!

59:11.334 --> 59:13.459
Not too much on that.
He's not Clark Gable, okay?

59:13.542 --> 59:15.417
Can somebody get a duster up there?

59:15.501 --> 59:17.751
We've got a cobweb
large enough to snag a sheep.

59:17.834 --> 59:19.667
We're opening in 15 minutes.

59:19.751 --> 59:21.268
Now, for the curtains
at the front, comrade,

59:21.292 --> 59:23.001
do you want ruched, not ruched?

59:23.084 --> 59:25.167
- Whatever. I don't care.
- Not ruched?

59:25.251 --> 59:27.751
- That's good. That's...
- Ruched? Not ruched?

59:28.251 --> 59:30.251
- Ruched?
- Would you stop with this?

59:30.709 --> 59:32.917
Why do you think I care?
Ah, excuse me.

59:34.542 --> 59:36.667
- Fix that button.
- Welcome, comrades.

59:36.751 --> 59:38.917
How's the Minister
for Fixtures and Fittings?

59:39.001 --> 59:40.268
It's going well. I'm enjoying it.

59:40.292 --> 59:42.459
- Yes, you're very passionate.
- Well...

59:42.542 --> 59:44.251
Yes, the ruched, please. Thank you.

59:44.334 --> 59:46.292
- You're doing a great job.
- I know.

59:46.376 --> 59:48.167
Well, hello. Are these...

59:48.251 --> 59:49.959
- Oh.
- These my...

59:50.042 --> 59:51.251
Which one of these is my girl?

59:51.334 --> 59:52.876
We couldn't find the actual girl, sir.

59:52.959 --> 59:54.667
These are some possible alternatives.

59:54.751 --> 59:56.959
No, no, I want you to find...
Excuse me.

59:57.042 --> 59:58.917
I want you to find
the girl in the photograph.

59:59.001 --> 01:00:00.959
Do you understand?
The nation depends on it.

01:00:02.126 --> 01:00:03.709
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.751
All right, girls, the Snow King
does not approve. Wait over there.

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:10.685
What happened?
Where's the girl in the photograph?

01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:12.292
We couldn't find the actual girl.

01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:15.959
I thought the entire point of the NKVD
was to know everyone's whereabouts.

01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:17.709
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, yes.

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:20.334
- So, you find her, you camel cock.
- Comrade Khrushchev.

01:00:21.001 --> 01:00:22.584
- Maria Veniaminovna.
- Yes.

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:25.167
I'm sorry that you heard that,
but he is a camel cock.

01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:27.167
- How are you, Maria?
- Stalin?

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:30.376
Yes. You want to have a look?

01:00:34.084 --> 01:00:37.084
Comrade Beria, this is Maria.
She'll be playing piano tonight.

01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.584
- Good to meet you.
- Comrade.

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:40.834
What do you think?

01:00:42.126 --> 01:00:45.459
Small. He looks so small.

01:00:49.834 --> 01:00:52.084
- Sad day, soldier. Sad Day.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:55.417
Aslanov. You handsome devil.

01:00:55.959 --> 01:00:58.334
Stick you in a frock,
I'd fucking ride you raw myself.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:00.709
- I will take that as a compliment.
- Yeah, don't.

01:01:00.792 --> 01:01:04.292
Right, what's a war hero got to do
to get some lubrication round here?

01:01:15.542 --> 01:01:17.042
Ah, Generalissimo.

01:01:17.126 --> 01:01:19.042
There he is, eh, the great man.

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:24.042
I've seen a lot of death,
but that... that is a loss.

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:25.626
Tell me something.

01:01:25.709 --> 01:01:29.917
Why has the army been replaced
by the NKVD all over Moscow?

01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:33.626
I mean, I'm smiling,
but I am very fucking furious.

01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:35.477
Perhaps this is a good time
for Comrade Yudina

01:01:35.501 --> 01:01:37.376
to go and prepare
those precious fingers.

01:01:37.459 --> 01:01:39.001
Yes. One moment, General.

01:01:39.084 --> 01:01:41.376
I will properly catch up with you
this evening.

01:01:41.501 --> 01:01:44.792
- I'm looking forward to it.
- You never kiss my hand any more.

01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:47.542
- I taught Nikita's niece to play.
- Yes, you did.

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:49.292
That was quite the salon recital.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:51.251
Oh, I love the idea of you at a salon.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.042
Do you have a party trick?
Burping the alphabet?

01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:58.667
Comrade Malenkov, with sharper
cheekbones, as requested.

01:01:58.751 --> 01:02:01.459
Sharp. Not sharp.
Sharp. Not sharp.

01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:03.709
I would like...

01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:08.167
...that one destroyed, thank you.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.310
Good luck with the performance
tonight, by the way.

01:02:10.334 --> 01:02:13.126
- Thank you.
- Nerve-racking, so many notes.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.459
- Yes.
- Like your one to Stalin.

01:02:17.084 --> 01:02:18.251
Which I have.

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:22.417
Come this way.

01:02:22.709 --> 01:02:25.126
Why has the army
been confined to barracks?

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:28.084
The decision was mine,
supported by Comrade Malenkov.

01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:29.542
Mm-hmm. Oh, was it indeed?

01:02:29.626 --> 01:02:31.584
That right, Georgy?
It was your call?

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:35.292
Um, yes, of course.
We had to make a decision.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:36.810
We're discussing the city's security.

01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:38.584
- I know.
- Jesus Christ.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.584
Did Coco Chanel
take a shit on your head?

01:02:41.501 --> 01:02:44.417
- No, he did not.
- Listen, listen.

01:02:44.542 --> 01:02:46.167
Moscow's gonna be boiling with people.

01:02:46.292 --> 01:02:49.542
His little fucking apes at the NKVD
won't know what to do.

01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:51.143
There's gonna be
thousands of civilians

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.917
flooding in from all over Russia.

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:54.792
No, we're controlling
the crowd at source.

01:02:54.876 --> 01:02:56.959
All trains and vans to Moscow
have been cancelled.

01:02:58.001 --> 01:02:59.268
- You can't do that.
- Wait a minute.

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:00.518
People have a right to see him.

01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:02.501
- Oh, come on. No, no, no.
- Just temporarily.

01:03:02.584 --> 01:03:06.042
I'm the funeral. I'm the trains.
This is horseshit, okay?

01:03:06.126 --> 01:03:09.501
I've been picking out funeral cushions
with Slim Hitler over there...

01:03:09.584 --> 01:03:12.709
calico this, taffeta that,
and you've done what?

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:15.126
No, I'm the trains and
I want them back.

01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:18.334
Well, let's see who can
mobilise first. Oh, seems to be me!

01:03:18.459 --> 01:03:20.209
You sneaky little shit.

01:03:21.042 --> 01:03:23.251
And we're opening the doors.

01:03:39.292 --> 01:03:42.626
Good. Steady pace.
Very good. Yes, just like that.

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:51.542
Rather overwhelming, isn't it?

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:54.972
And nobody's making them do this,
are they?

01:03:55.042 --> 01:03:56.209
- No, no.
- No.

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:58.751
Just round to the right. Thank you.

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:01.501
I don't suppose you want a chair?

01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:05.626
Oh, no, no, no. I can't sit down.
I haven't sat down since he died.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:07.251
One can't. He was too big.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:10.667
Yes.

01:04:13.376 --> 01:04:14.542
Do you remember Alexei?

01:04:16.834 --> 01:04:20.001
- I remember everyone. It's a gift.
- Oh.

01:04:20.084 --> 01:04:21.792
Do you remember
the way he used to laugh?

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:27.376
- Alexei Kapler, yes, yes.
- Yes.

01:04:28.209 --> 01:04:30.834
Yes, special to you, of course.

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:33.751
Some unsuitable associates.

01:04:34.251 --> 01:04:36.459
Tragic, really.

01:04:36.626 --> 01:04:38.584
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:41.667
Yes, well,
I want you to bring him back.

01:04:44.209 --> 01:04:46.167
The way that you brought
Molotov's wife back.

01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:49.001
She...

01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:53.917
- Well, I'd kept her as...
- Yeah, but I just want one person.

01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:56.167
Just one person.

01:04:56.876 --> 01:04:58.709
- Oh, my darling.
- Please.

01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:02.542
For you,
I will attempt the impossible.

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:14.542
Keep it moving if you can. Thank you.

01:05:14.959 --> 01:05:16.584
A lot of people to process.

01:05:25.584 --> 01:05:29.292
Oh, fucking pollen. They should make
gas bombs out of the stuff.

01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:33.584
Wait, wait, wait.
That's not gonna fit.

01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:37.209
- It's larger than the region itself.
- Go back. Go back.

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:38.959
Hunker down.

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:42.417
A quarter turn.

01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:45.792
Through on that line.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:50.209
- How's Polina?
- She's well.

01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:54.334
I can sense how sorry she is
for her treachery.

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:58.542
Jesus Christ, it's the bishops.

01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:02.459
I thought we'd banned those freaks.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.792
Sneeze on the bastards
as they go past.

01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:06.584
- Did you invite them?
- No.

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:10.417
- Ask Beria if he invited the bishops.
- Don't give me orders.

01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:14.542
Ask Beria if he invited the bishops.

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:17.709
- Did you invite the bishops?
- Yes.

01:06:18.501 --> 01:06:19.792
- Yes.
- Well?

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.501
He said yes.

01:06:22.251 --> 01:06:24.417
I'm going to give everyone
in Red Square a voucher

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:27.834
permitting one kick each
to his stupid face.

01:06:27.959 --> 01:06:29.876
Is he asking for some delicious hay?

01:06:29.959 --> 01:06:34.001
No, he said something quite
complicated about a voucher system.

01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:38.626
Ask Nikita why in God's arse
he invited the bishops.

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:40.792
- No, I've already explained why...
- Ask Nikita.

01:06:40.876 --> 01:06:42.042
You tell him...

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:45.709
- Never mind. Swap.
- No.

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:47.917
- Just swap with me.
- I said no.

01:06:48.501 --> 01:06:50.501
We can make it look like
it's part of the ceremony.

01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:05.876
What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:15.001
Buttoned-up sacks of shit! Fleabags!

01:07:15.084 --> 01:07:16.709
Should I handle this for you?

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:22.417
Foreigners. A vile crime
has been perpetrated.

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:26.501
Hairy monsters in coats
have scooped out my father's brain

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.042
and sent it to America.

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:32.501
And these traitors,
sucking the cocks and balls...

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:35.334
...sucking the cocks and balls
of Zionist...

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:39.042
New York...
New York Zionist queers in petticoats.

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:41.834
Look at them. You see?
Those brain thieves.

01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:43.717
- Do not translate this.
- I see you. Heed me.

01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:46.292
- There's food next door, gentlemen.
- I'm Stalin's son!

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:49.667
You will not take me down.
I will not go down!

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:51.834
Please,
this side. I'm sorry. I apologise.

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:54.542
I will not be silen...

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:56.626
I know about the hockey team.

01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:59.876
- I'm most deeply...
- Up we go. That's it.

01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:01.626
Thank you all for your...

01:08:01.876 --> 01:08:03.251
Medic!

01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:04.626
Not today!

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:08.251
You're a fucking stain
on that uniform. You fucking behave.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:10.334
What is going on?

01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:12.334
He felt a little overwhelmed,
Svetlana.

01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:15.626
Harm. This is a perfect
example of harm.

01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:17.792
- He's okay.
- Come here. Get up.

01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:20.417
- Who did this?
- I did, and I enjoyed it.

01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:21.876
It's been a long time coming.

01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:24.084
If any of you...

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:27.376
...should do anything...

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:29.917
Right, well, that's me told.

01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:33.001
I'm off to represent
the entire Red Army at the buffet.

01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:34.292
You girls enjoy yourself.

01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:38.459
Are you all right? He fell very hard.

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:39.917
Why did you let him do that?

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:43.251
Yes, I should have intercepted
his fist with my face.

01:08:43.334 --> 01:08:45.584
I want to make a speech
at my father's funeral.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:49.126
- And I want to fuck Grace Kelly.
- I simply don't care.

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:51.417
I want to make a speech
at my father's funeral.

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.209
Comrade Malenkov, your view?

01:08:54.417 --> 01:08:55.501
Well, I think, um...

01:08:56.876 --> 01:08:58.792
it can be, um...

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.667
- no... no problem.
- Ah...

01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:03.126
Technically, yes, but practically...

01:09:03.209 --> 01:09:05.459
There are programmatic complications.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.792
You know, I think I misspoke
when I said, "No problem."

01:09:07.876 --> 01:09:10.126
What I meant was, "No."

01:09:10.876 --> 01:09:11.876
"Problem."

01:09:14.084 --> 01:09:16.834
Ignore me. I'm... It's no problem.

01:09:16.959 --> 01:09:19.001
- Yes. I take that as a yes.
- Go ahead, Nikita.

01:09:19.126 --> 01:09:21.834
I will unlock the schedule
and squeeze him in.

01:09:21.959 --> 01:09:23.584
I will not be squeezed.

01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:26.167
Sometimes the shortest speeches
are the most memorable.

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.792
- Well, that's as maybe.
- True. Fish! Let's eat.

01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:30.584
- What's going on?
- I don't...

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.209
I look forward
to the five garbled words

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.334
we afford him
before we start the flypast.

01:09:36.459 --> 01:09:38.917
Hey, we need to talk.
First the trains, now the bishops.

01:09:39.251 --> 01:09:40.876
Who else are we pals with now?

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:43.292
- You invite any old Nazis?
- Excuse me.

01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:45.917
These stairs are like climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro.

01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:47.626
I'm more sweat than man.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.667
- Did you see off Vasily?
- Yes, we did.

01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:51.709
And thank you
for landing me this funeral.

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:53.751
Come on, Nicky. You're enjoying it.

01:09:53.876 --> 01:09:56.209
But why did you
have to invite the bishops?

01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:58.876
What, you think I wanted
those boyfriends of Christ here?

01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:00.042
That was his idea.

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:02.542
Lavrenti, you of all people must know

01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:04.334
that religion
has never been part of...

01:10:04.459 --> 01:10:07.126
You lecturing me?
You standing in the Hall of Columns

01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:09.542
still insisting on Polina's guilt?

01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:12.376
Well, she... she is...

01:10:14.584 --> 01:10:17.251
- Um, sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have...
- Oh, come on.

01:10:17.459 --> 01:10:20.584
No, no. You both called
the blameless Polina Molotova

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:23.501
a traitor and a parasite
in her own apartment. I heard you.

01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:26.584
She was guilty.
You found her guilty.

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:28.959
And Stalin agreed.
Nobody doubted.

01:10:29.084 --> 01:10:31.042
Nobody doubted.
Past tense, you see.

01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:33.667
In the good old days you pine for,
that sort of dissonance

01:10:33.792 --> 01:10:35.432
would have had you both shot.
Both of you.

01:10:35.459 --> 01:10:38.126
Oh,
this is just fucking wordplay.

01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:39.251
Oh, is it?

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:43.084
Allegiance to the party line, hm?
That was what Stalin demanded.

01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:44.334
Correct, Comrade Molotov?

01:10:44.417 --> 01:10:47.501
Um, allegiance to the party line? Yes.

01:10:47.584 --> 01:10:49.501
And defiance of the party line,

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.584
that would mark you out
as a traitor, wouldn't it?

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:54.917
I'm ashamed and I... I...

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:58.501
I beg your forgiveness
for my selfish deceitfulness,

01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:01.917
and I will go and reassure Polina.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:08.852
You're just making this shit up
as you go along.

01:11:08.876 --> 01:11:11.751
- What game is this, Lavrenti?
- Oh, don't be hysterical.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:14.876
- We're in a new reality.
- What, you're the good guy now?

01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:16.251
You locked up half the nation.

01:11:16.334 --> 01:11:18.709
You beat them, you raped them,
you killed them.

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:20.292
Yes, and now I'm releasing them.

01:11:20.417 --> 01:11:22.626
And you won't believe
how many will be free.

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:24.876
So now you want the public
to love you, is that it?

01:11:25.751 --> 01:11:27.951
You're bending and cracking the truth
like a human body.

01:11:28.001 --> 01:11:29.084
The truth?

01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.751
This from the man who invited
his bit-on-the-side whore pianist

01:11:31.876 --> 01:11:34.276
to play at the funeral,
even though she swore to kill Stalin,

01:11:34.334 --> 01:11:35.334
who's now dead.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:38.001
Whoa. What the barrelling fuck
are you talking about?

01:11:38.084 --> 01:11:40.292
She wanted Stalin dead
and she knows your family.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:42.626
She taught your niece
to play, remember?

01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:45.001
I think you should read this.

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:50.292
It's the copy of a note I found
by Stalin's body, from the pianist.

01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:53.001
It's lucky we both now live
in the new Soviet Union

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:54.435
or you and your wife and your family

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:57.667
would be a pile of dust
on the floor of a crematorium toilet.

01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:02.542
Kobulov! My stomach's rumbling.

01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:04.292
Is there any cheese in this building?

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:13.334
No, I don't have time
for that shit right now.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.001
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back, come back.

01:12:16.084 --> 01:12:17.209
No, go.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:22.084
New security orders.
Restart the trains, all right?

01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:25.126
Open the city's borders
and let the people back into Moscow.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.626
They deserve to see the old man.

01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:31.126
Let's see how Beria's goons
cope with that.

01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:39.417
Train to Moscow in five minutes!

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:20.376
- What's going on?
- Trains are bringing them in.

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:29.751
Quiet. Quiet, quiet.

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:32.042
Turn around!

01:13:33.667 --> 01:13:37.209
- This is a secure area!
- We've come to see Comrade Stalin!

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:40.042
Back. Get back. Back!

01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:41.751
Back.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:45.167
- Stay back.
- Stay where you are!

01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:49.501
Fire over their heads.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:11.084
Don't let them through!

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:20.417
This is your work, is it?

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:22.126
Why? Are there spelling mistakes?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.042
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Beria is?

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:29.501
He's releasing people from prison.

01:14:29.626 --> 01:14:32.209
That was my idea.
I was going to do that.

01:14:33.334 --> 01:14:36.001
I'm the reformer. Me.

01:14:36.084 --> 01:14:40.667
Don't you fucking laugh at me.
I was going to release the bishops.

01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:42.959
- I thought you hated the Church.
- I do!

01:14:43.084 --> 01:14:45.917
Just tell me it's not true.
Did you write this?

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:49.667
Stalin killed my family, my friends.

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:53.251
- Zinaida Reich, Kuperchinski.
- Kup... You knew Kuperchinski?

01:14:53.376 --> 01:14:55.256
I should have you shot
just for saying his name.

01:14:55.376 --> 01:14:57.459
Comrade Nikita Sergeyevich,
you know me. I...

01:14:57.584 --> 01:15:01.167
Stop. No, I... I don't know you.
You don't know me.

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:05.334
You fucking taught
my niece piano lessons. That's it.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.959
Don't you see what Beria's done now?
He's tied me to you.

01:15:09.084 --> 01:15:10.334
We are tied together.

01:15:11.334 --> 01:15:12.751
- Like a rock...
- I know.

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:14.292
...that's sinking and...

01:15:14.459 --> 01:15:16.792
But I'm confident of everlasting life.

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:21.126
Who the fuck in their right mind
would want everlasting life?

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:23.209
The endless conversation.

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:30.334
Piano lessons, Nicky?
How's the fingering?

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.667
She hit the high note, did she?

01:15:32.792 --> 01:15:34.292
F sharp?

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.501
Yeah, two clowns,
one joke between you.

01:15:36.626 --> 01:15:38.084
Work on your fucking material.

01:15:40.084 --> 01:15:41.626
Something's happening over there.

01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:45.292
I hate him.
Hate her. Fucking wet box.

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:48.334
- Can you please just be cordial?
- I know the drill.

01:15:48.459 --> 01:15:50.876
Smile, shake hands
and try not to call them a cunt.

01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:52.417
Perfect. That's perfect.

01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:55.876
- How many?
- 1500.

01:15:56.001 --> 01:15:57.376
- Dead?
- Yes.

01:15:57.917 --> 01:16:00.626
- I need a man with an army.
- Comrade minister.

01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:04.876
I found her. She's uh...
grown a little since the photograph.

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:07.126
She's the size of an ostrich. No.

01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:09.042
Okay, can we just go back
to my original idea

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:11.709
and find a girl
who looks like her but little?

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:14.376
No higher than this.
Chalk it on your fucking trousers.

01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:17.959
Modern soldier's greatest fear.
It's not death. It's not starvation.

01:16:18.084 --> 01:16:19.126
It's chafing.

01:16:19.251 --> 01:16:21.667
And then he planted the flag
on Hitler's bunker

01:16:21.792 --> 01:16:23.959
or he knocked the bear out
with one punch.

01:16:24.084 --> 01:16:27.042
Either way, the man's a war hero.
Excuse us, please.

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:29.459
Listen, it was Goebbels' bunker,
not Hitler's.

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:32.251
Listen to me. I was the one
who put the trains back on.

01:16:32.376 --> 01:16:33.959
- Comrade General...
- Fuck off!

01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:35.709
Or I'll punch you into a sticky pulp.

01:16:35.834 --> 01:16:37.917
- Thank you.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

01:16:38.042 --> 01:16:39.917
I don't know, okay, but I did it.

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:42.751
- And I really need your help.
- To do what?

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.477
There's bodies fucking
piling up in the street.

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:45.541
It's a bit late, isn't it.

01:16:45.584 --> 01:16:47.917
What if we blame this on someone...

01:16:48.042 --> 01:16:49.751
- Wait.
- ...who's out of control.

01:16:49.876 --> 01:16:52.876
Nicky, be very careful
what you say next.

01:16:53.584 --> 01:16:54.667
Who?

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:57.084
Beria.

01:16:58.042 --> 01:17:00.376
I'm gonna have to report
this conversation.

01:17:00.501 --> 01:17:01.917
Threatening to do harm

01:17:02.042 --> 01:17:04.709
or obstruct any member
of the Presidium in the process of...

01:17:04.834 --> 01:17:06.459
Look at your fucking face.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:11.126
Nikita Khrushchev.

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:14.542
- You balls like Kremlin domes.
- Stop. Be serious. Are you in?

01:17:14.667 --> 01:17:18.209
I'm in, I'm in. That fucker thinks
he can take on the Red Army.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:21.959
I fucked Germany. I think I can take
a flesh lump in a fucking waistcoat.

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:24.709
- It's got to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:26.667
Sorry.
You busy washing your hair or what?

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.167
Tomorrow's the funeral.

01:17:28.292 --> 01:17:31.292
Yeah, the day that the entire fucking
army's in town with their guns.

01:17:32.626 --> 01:17:33.876
That's perfect.

01:17:34.001 --> 01:17:36.626
But we need the Presidium on board.
Every one of them.

01:17:36.834 --> 01:17:39.417
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Malenkov's a bit tricky.

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:42.667
- No. We need fucking all of them.
- Well, I'll get him.

01:17:48.876 --> 01:17:50.209
- How many?
- 1500.

01:17:50.334 --> 01:17:53.459
Find Khrushchev. I want to talk
to him about his future.

01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:55.126
A very short conversation.

01:17:56.459 --> 01:17:59.084
If you could do me a favour
and just nod as I'm speaking.

01:17:59.209 --> 01:18:01.001
People are looking to me
for reassurance

01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:02.626
and I have no idea what is going on.

01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:05.584
We will bring the situation
under control. Order will be restored.

01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:08.667
This moron has restarted the trains.

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:11.959
And your men pissed their pants
and killed 1500 people.

01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:13.376
We were controlling the crowd.

01:18:13.459 --> 01:18:15.060
Those people weren't
supposed to be there.

01:18:15.084 --> 01:18:16.167
Are you blaming the dead

01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:17.376
for their own death?

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:20.584
I'm gonna tell you who's going to be
blamed. I am going to be blamed.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.751
This shit sack is going to be blamed.

01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:25.209
Let's get out of here.

01:18:28.292 --> 01:18:31.459
- Comrade, your girl. A girl.
- Ah! There you are.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.626
Are we ready for the balcony wave?

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:37.376
Who's gonna carry the can
for this farrago of shit?

01:18:37.459 --> 01:18:39.459
That's easy. Khrushchev.
He put the trains back on.

01:18:39.667 --> 01:18:41.417
And you shot the people
getting off them.

01:18:41.626 --> 01:18:43.209
- Yes, he has a point.
- No, he doesn't.

01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:44.917
There's no point
to Nikita Khrushchev.

01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:47.959
Well, how about this?
We blame the security forces.

01:18:48.084 --> 01:18:50.126
Right? Hothead officers
on the ground.

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:52.001
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:52.084 --> 01:18:54.292
Do you still possess a working brain?

01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:57.334
You dumb animal.
I <i>am</i> the security forces

01:18:57.459 --> 01:19:00.459
and I'm not gonna be made the villain
for this catastrophe.

01:19:00.542 --> 01:19:03.709
Look, even if you do get blamed,
we close ranks.

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:06.397
If anyone has a pop at you,
they have to come through us first.

01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:09.084
Yes, good idea.
Give me the girl. All right?

01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:11.792
- A lot of this is your own doing.
- You spineless rat.

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:14.459
You're just a cadaver
we propped up in a corset.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.292
- Ohh...
- Hey, hey, easy.

01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:19.501
It's time all of you realised who kept
the daggers out of your backs.

01:19:19.626 --> 01:19:22.626
Show some fucking respect.
I... I've got... I've got...

01:19:22.751 --> 01:19:25.042
I've got documents.
I have documents on all of you.

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.876
You, 13th of March, 1937.

01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:30.251
Zolotov trials.
Forty-two dead, 173 exiled.

01:19:30.334 --> 01:19:32.126
- Your signature.
- Beria, that's enough!

01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:34.792
Yeah, well, you signed off
the life of your own brother!

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:37.376
Oh, you think that was easy?
You bastard!

01:19:37.459 --> 01:19:38.626
Bagrov, Gorev.

01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:40.834
How did your conscience
accommodate that?

01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:44.417
And Zykov! Zykov!
Poor blameless, guileless Zykov.

01:19:44.501 --> 01:19:45.584
All of you!

01:19:46.834 --> 01:19:49.209
All of you.
I have documents on all of you!

01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:50.685
I've seen what you've done.

01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:52.334
I know the truth.
It's all written down.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:56.501
It's all written down on a very...
on a very fucking long list!

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.626
Just pick them up.

01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:03.626
Are we done? Hm?

01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:07.209
We will convene
tomorrow after the funeral.

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:09.376
I will nominate some scapegoats.

01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:12.251
We can arraign a couple
of the officers who fired.

01:20:12.376 --> 01:20:13.576
- No harm done.
- Are you okay?

01:20:13.667 --> 01:20:16.626
Only comrades and friends
could shout at each other like this.

01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:19.126
Right, so we'll fix this
in committee, all right?

01:20:19.251 --> 01:20:22.167
Right, right...
He's using you, Georgy.

01:20:22.292 --> 01:20:24.251
He's using you
and then he's gonna kill you.

01:20:24.376 --> 01:20:27.126
- You saw those papers.
- What are you talking about?

01:20:27.251 --> 01:20:30.251
Jesus, Nicky, he was pointing at you.
He wasn't pointing at me.

01:20:30.376 --> 01:20:31.709
No, he said "all of you".

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:34.626
No, no.
I was over there, you know?

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:37.542
- And he went "all of you".
- Yeah, "all of you".

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:39.667
- No, no.
- Yes.

01:20:39.792 --> 01:20:41.584
- "All of you."
- All of us.

01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:44.042
No, he said "all of you".

01:20:44.167 --> 01:20:48.376
You know, all of you
can kiss my Russian arse.

01:20:48.501 --> 01:20:49.792
All of <i>you.</i>

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:52.001
On the balcony. Let's go.

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:09.126
Why did Molotov
want to meet us at dawn?

01:21:09.251 --> 01:21:12.167
- Is he planning a duel?
- Said he wanted to start early.

01:21:12.251 --> 01:21:13.417
Murderer!

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:16.292
You killed hundreds, Nicky.

01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:18.542
You certainly got your big funeral.

01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:21.626
- I'm regretting this already.
- Get in the car.

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:24.084
- What?
- Can't talk. Get in the car.

01:21:30.917 --> 01:21:33.001
I see she moults.

01:21:33.084 --> 01:21:35.834
This is for hungry ears.

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:38.667
The drivers.

01:21:41.376 --> 01:21:43.167
Let's do him in.

01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:45.042
- Who?
- Beria.

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:47.584
The treacherous snake
brought back the bishops.

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:49.084
He brought back Polina.

01:21:49.167 --> 01:21:51.417
He expressly ignored
all Stalin's orders.

01:21:51.501 --> 01:21:53.834
His men opened fire
on innocent people.

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:57.584
He'll get the blame.
Clever, eh, Nicky?

01:21:57.667 --> 01:21:59.417
Yes, Beria is the murderer here.

01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:02.709
This is how the Soviet Union
was built. Not with bishops.

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:06.042
Today Beria gets
an eight-foot crucifix up his arse.

01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:07.959
- Good.
- I've...

01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:10.751
I've had nightmares
that made more sense than this.

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:13.626
- Now we have a majority.
- Yes, you do.

01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:17.917
- You two, me and Bulganin.
- Mikoyan and Malenkov.

01:22:18.626 --> 01:22:20.876
- No... but we still have a majority.
- No, no, no.

01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:22.334
Everyone in or not at all.

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:25.959
Oh, come on. Slava, you just...
Dammit, you just said...

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.001
- All in or it's off.
- No...

01:22:28.084 --> 01:22:32.126
This is what Stalin would have wanted.
The Committee as one.

01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:36.209
But you've got to act fast, comrade.
Act fast or be dead.

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:38.834
Yes, Uncle Nicky's going to be dead

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:40.834
if he doesn't get a move on, isn't he?

01:22:40.959 --> 01:22:42.251
Yes, he is.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:45.042
How's my guest?

01:22:45.501 --> 01:22:47.667
Yes, I'm working on my speech.
It's good.

01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:49.292
I've brought you something.

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:52.542
No.

01:22:52.626 --> 01:22:54.459
I'm not drinking.
I'm using water.

01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:56.417
It's just to calm your nerves.

01:22:56.501 --> 01:22:57.893
Yes, actually,
I will need some of that.

01:22:57.917 --> 01:23:00.417
- No. He's not drinking.
- No, I'm not drinking.

01:23:01.292 --> 01:23:03.792
- How's the speech?
- Um... ba-dum-ba-dum...

01:23:04.001 --> 01:23:05.126
My father...

01:23:06.626 --> 01:23:09.251
...was a warm and mighty bear,

01:23:09.792 --> 01:23:14.501
and we are his 170 million
orphaned cubs.

01:23:14.626 --> 01:23:18.501
Russian cubs, Georgian cubs,
Armenian cubs, Lithuanian...

01:23:18.584 --> 01:23:20.542
We'll leave you to it. Come on.

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.667
So, Lithuanian cubs,

01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:25.834
Ukrainian cubs, Moldavian cubs...

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:27.042
Svetlana.

01:23:29.459 --> 01:23:30.834
Alexei's dead.

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:37.001
15th of March, 1949.

01:23:38.001 --> 01:23:41.376
Attempted escape from Kolyma
with 12 others.

01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:42.917
Executed. I'm sorry.

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:44.834
But you said you would get him back.

01:23:44.959 --> 01:23:50.126
Listen, it was outside my direct
control. It just wasn't possible.

01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:52.834
Yes, but you said that
you would attempt the impossible.

01:23:52.959 --> 01:23:56.876
I hate being sober. It's a terrible,
terrible mood to be in.

01:23:58.126 --> 01:23:59.393
Why don't we go through that speech

01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:00.751
- one more time?
- Sit down.

01:24:00.834 --> 01:24:02.227
Get off me.
I can see what you're doing.

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.771
- I don't want to sit down.
- Sit down.

01:24:04.417 --> 01:24:06.084
I don't want to sit down!

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:14.167
Right, many terrible things were done
in the service of the Union.

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:16.126
Evidence was fabricated.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:18.792
Those who are responsible
will be found...

01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:21.334
And what will you do to them?
Question them to death?

01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:22.459
You know what I'm doing?

01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:24.751
I'm offering you and
that bloated soak my protection.

01:24:24.834 --> 01:24:28.834
- We are not children!
- You are a real listener. Thank you.

01:24:30.084 --> 01:24:32.667
- I am not a child.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

01:24:32.751 --> 01:24:36.751
And I warn you, stick by my side
or you will both be beaten inside out

01:24:36.876 --> 01:24:38.834
and strung up
for the crows by the others.

01:24:38.959 --> 01:24:40.042
Why should I trust you?

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:42.292
Because I'm the only one
who's telling you.

01:24:43.751 --> 01:24:45.001
Trust no-one.

01:24:56.126 --> 01:24:59.751
Georgy, Georgy.
Georgy, we have to act today.

01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:01.084
Act, you limpet?

01:25:01.167 --> 01:25:04.751
Act sombre, act respectful
like the rest of us, please.

01:25:04.834 --> 01:25:06.667
Do you understand
how important this is?

01:25:06.792 --> 01:25:08.834
- Would you...
- Places, comrades, please.

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.018
Form up either side of the...
Comrade, thank you very much.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:13.209
If you could join
your comrades over here.

01:25:13.292 --> 01:25:14.584
- Thank you.
- Damn it.

01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:22.209
All right, guys, come on. Lift it up.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:24.459
- That's it.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:25:24.542 --> 01:25:25.626
- Which foot?
- Left foot.

01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:27.001
I don't have a good balance.

01:25:27.084 --> 01:25:28.292
Okay. Yes.

01:25:28.417 --> 01:25:30.084
Ooh. Argh.

01:25:33.667 --> 01:25:35.501
Georgy...

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:38.667
Not now. God sakes.

01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:44.542
- Georgy, we really have to talk.
- Shut up. Have some respect.

01:25:45.126 --> 01:25:47.792
- Is Malenkov on board?
- Yes, 100 percent.

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:49.417
Saddle up, cowboy.

01:25:49.501 --> 01:25:53.292
- Is Malenkov with us?
- Trust me, 100 percent.

01:25:53.376 --> 01:25:54.584
Yes!

01:25:54.792 --> 01:25:57.542
- So you're on board, then, Molotov?
- Yeah.

01:25:57.626 --> 01:25:59.709
Okay. You've got me, then, Nicky.

01:25:59.792 --> 01:26:03.042
Put your dancing shoes on.

01:26:03.251 --> 01:26:05.876
- Which way shall I...
- Left.

01:26:06.626 --> 01:26:07.834
All right.

01:26:07.917 --> 01:26:11.251
Okay, let's go and catch
a pig for the pot.

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:16.626
<i>Stalin's love of the nation
was unwavering.</i>

01:26:16.751 --> 01:26:21.501
<i>So must we now take
our unwavering pain,</i>

01:26:21.834 --> 01:26:25.001
<i>our unwavering love,</i>

01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:30.667
and with it build an unwavering,
unwavering... future.

01:26:30.959 --> 01:26:32.834
Guns, please, gentlemen.

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:36.126
Take good care of this.
Don't want it going off.

01:26:36.209 --> 01:26:40.417
<i>Today we pause.
We pause in grief and sorrow.</i>

01:26:40.501 --> 01:26:44.126
But is not a pause in itself
part of the revolution?

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:50.042
I think it is.

01:26:50.126 --> 01:26:51.959
Okay, let's tango.

01:26:52.042 --> 01:26:53.709
You heard him, gentlemen. Let's go.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:56.042
<i>We must embrace our terrible loss</i>

01:26:56.126 --> 01:26:58.792
<i>with the strength and love
for our nation...</i>

01:26:59.501 --> 01:27:01.959
<i>that Stalin himself held</i>

01:27:02.042 --> 01:27:03.501
in his mighty heart.

01:27:05.417 --> 01:27:06.667
Check the stalls.

01:27:08.417 --> 01:27:10.959
<i>We promise you rights and liberties...</i>

01:27:11.042 --> 01:27:13.542
bread... and peace.

01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:19.501
<i>My father
was a great social scientist.</i>

01:27:20.084 --> 01:27:23.251
But we,
the people of the Soviet Union,

01:27:23.334 --> 01:27:25.417
are not laboratory animals.

01:27:27.834 --> 01:27:30.667
<i>We are all but cubs.</i>

01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:33.084
Russian cubs,

01:27:33.209 --> 01:27:35.209
Georgian cubs,

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.542
Armenian cubs,

01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:39.417
Lithuanian cubs...

01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:42.042
Latvian cubs...

01:27:42.626 --> 01:27:44.792
Estonian cubs.

01:27:53.251 --> 01:27:55.626
- Very good speech, Lavrenti.
- Thank you.

01:27:55.751 --> 01:27:58.376
Yes, "bread and peace".
I knew it would work.

01:27:59.626 --> 01:28:01.146
It was between "peace" and "sausages".

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:05.292
Both good things, but you know
where you are with a sausage.

01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:10.209
Your name rings out.
Malenkov the hero. Good lad.

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:12.126
Vasily's face
when the planes flew over.

01:28:13.417 --> 01:28:15.542
Should have strafed the little shit.

01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:18.417
Poor Vasily. I sometimes wonder
if he's meant for this world.

01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:21.334
I salute you, Top Boy,
and I salute your haircut.

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:23.459
- Goodnight, Vienna.
- Georgy.

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.126
Action is gonna be taken
at the meeting.

01:28:27.209 --> 01:28:28.376
Action? What action?

01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:32.251
Is this why everyone is treating me
like they wanna fuck my sister?

01:28:33.459 --> 01:28:35.834
Zhukov has everybody on board
against Beria.

01:28:35.917 --> 01:28:37.560
- When I heard that, I agreed too.
- Yes, yes.

01:28:37.584 --> 01:28:42.251
But Zhukov...
is not governing the Soviet Union.

01:28:42.334 --> 01:28:45.417
I am governing the Soviet Union.

01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:47.209
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

01:28:47.292 --> 01:28:50.459
Now, I like him and I'll be happy
to listen to what he has to say.

01:28:50.542 --> 01:28:52.751
You'll definitely have a chance
to talk to him.

01:28:52.834 --> 01:28:56.084
Perhaps what we can do
is give Beria a slight demotion,

01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:58.584
I don't know, Ministry for Fisheries.

01:29:00.959 --> 01:29:04.376
All right, boys.
Meet your dates for tonight.

01:29:04.959 --> 01:29:06.501
I'll take the tall blonde.

01:29:08.626 --> 01:29:10.959
Comrades, time to set aside our grief

01:29:11.042 --> 01:29:14.834
and begin to write the next chapter
of our great history.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:16.667
- Comrade Malenkov...
- Proceed.

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:19.209
Item one, the unfortunate events
of yesterday evening.

01:29:19.334 --> 01:29:22.876
It's clear that the regrettable deaths
of so many citizens...

01:29:22.959 --> 01:29:26.334
Comrades. Comrades,
I would like to propose a new agenda.

01:29:26.417 --> 01:29:28.792
Item one,
the conduct of Comrade Beria.

01:29:28.917 --> 01:29:31.209
Seconded. Time to take stock.

01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:33.501
If you have
a serious proposal, comrade,

01:29:33.584 --> 01:29:34.876
I suggest "Any Other Business".

01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:36.376
I accuse Comrade Beria

01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:38.417
of centralising power
within his Ministry

01:29:38.501 --> 01:29:40.518
at the expense of the Party
and Central Committee...

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.084
- There's no tabled motion.
- ...betraying the Soviet Union.

01:29:43.209 --> 01:29:45.834
I deplore this wanton
breach of protocol. Georgy.

01:29:45.959 --> 01:29:48.542
Breach, my arse!
This is an ad hoc motion.

01:29:48.959 --> 01:29:51.501
It will end very badly for you.
Georgy, Georgy!

01:29:51.584 --> 01:29:53.917
Georgy, press the button
underneath the desk.

01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:55.959
- Press the button, Georgy.
- What button?

01:29:56.084 --> 01:29:58.001
- Arrest that madman.
- Where's the button?

01:30:00.376 --> 01:30:02.417
Good luck, ladies.

01:30:02.542 --> 01:30:03.709
Guards!

01:30:06.626 --> 01:30:07.626
Guards!

01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:09.376
Hands up or
I'll shoot you in the face.

01:30:09.501 --> 01:30:10.792
Guards!

01:30:10.876 --> 01:30:12.001
Oh, shit.

01:30:12.334 --> 01:30:13.959
- Guards!
- Oi!

01:30:17.292 --> 01:30:19.251
Want a job done properly,
you call the army.

01:30:19.792 --> 01:30:21.084
Take his belt off.

01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:22.977
It's hard to run away
with your pants falling down.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.459
If you want to talk to General Zhukov,
now's your opportunity.

01:30:25.542 --> 01:30:28.167
Spit it out, Georgy.
Staging a coup here.

01:30:28.751 --> 01:30:30.376
He's got a knife by his ankle.

01:30:30.459 --> 01:30:33.126
- You're a disgrace.
- Give his head a good kicking.

01:30:33.251 --> 01:30:35.167
- Make you feel better.
- All in good time.

01:30:35.292 --> 01:30:40.792
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy peeling the skin
from your self-satisfied face.

01:30:40.876 --> 01:30:43.334
Not with that, you won't.
Come on, then.

01:30:49.126 --> 01:30:50.959
Sorry, comrades.

01:30:51.459 --> 01:30:53.084
- Wrong room.
- Aslanov.

01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:54.917
- Go and kill them.
- Kobulov.

01:30:55.001 --> 01:30:56.292
- Shall we?
- Yes, right.

01:30:56.376 --> 01:30:58.126
Let's do this.
Georgy, come on, now.

01:30:58.792 --> 01:31:00.584
Suit doesn't really work
without this belt.

01:31:08.376 --> 01:31:09.501
Oh, shit.

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.917
Third door on the left. On the left.

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:17.959
I have been picturing this moment

01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:20.417
every day for the last three decades.

01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:24.167
Arrest the staff.
Arrest all Beria's staff.

01:31:24.334 --> 01:31:26.459
Check the bedrooms.

01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:28.643
Come out. You're safe.
This way. Come out this way.

01:31:28.667 --> 01:31:30.209
You're safe. Come out.

01:31:30.292 --> 01:31:32.334
- You, take her down.
- This way.

01:31:34.667 --> 01:31:36.501
Is this magisterial
enough for you all?

01:31:36.584 --> 01:31:38.501
This charade? This is a lavatory!

01:31:38.584 --> 01:31:41.417
Well, you should feel at home, then,
you little coil of shit.

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:42.542
Fuck me.

01:31:42.626 --> 01:31:45.917
Georgy's eyes really do follow
you round the crapper. It's weird.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.121
Why did they hang a picture
of my grandmother in here?

01:31:49.792 --> 01:31:52.042
This is madness.
This is madness.

01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:54.792
- He deserves a trial.
- He'll get a trial. Take it easy.

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.459
Georgy!
Can't even look me in the eye.

01:31:57.542 --> 01:32:00.001
- Guilt. Guilty, all of you.
- Say nothing.

01:32:00.126 --> 01:32:03.501
Georgy, you'll get over it.
I did. Took me about five minutes.

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:06.501
H-How long before the army's here?
We're in complete limbo now.

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:09.834
Not long. We have to wait
for the NKVD to leave the Kremlin.

01:32:09.959 --> 01:32:14.001
In that case, if nobody objects,
I'm going to spend a kopeck.

01:32:14.126 --> 01:32:15.834
It's the excitement, I think.

01:32:19.209 --> 01:32:20.459
Right, hold your fire.

01:32:20.667 --> 01:32:23.042
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

01:32:23.167 --> 01:32:25.209
The army's back.
Did you miss us?

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:30.542
- Take their weapons.
- Come on, this way.

01:32:33.417 --> 01:32:36.792
All right, Judy Garland,
boys and girls. It's showtime.

01:32:39.126 --> 01:32:40.167
Georgy.

01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:43.501
- Georgy, you have to sign this now.
- No. No.

01:32:43.584 --> 01:32:46.584
No. He deserves a fair trial.
He's one of us.

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:51.042
What about Tukhachevsky
and Piatakov?

01:32:51.209 --> 01:32:52.751
Did they get a trial?

01:32:52.876 --> 01:32:54.709
What about Sokolnikov?

01:32:55.167 --> 01:32:57.292
Who begged him to look after
his elderly mother.

01:32:57.417 --> 01:33:00.542
And what did this monster do?
He strangled her in front of him.

01:33:02.542 --> 01:33:03.709
It's too late.

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:07.834
The only choice we have
is between his death or his revenge.

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:10.709
And you will fucking sign this.

01:33:23.084 --> 01:33:24.542
I want it to go on record:

01:33:25.167 --> 01:33:27.084
this was not my first
course of action.

01:33:30.084 --> 01:33:32.001
Stalin would be loving this.

01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:39.959
Through the door.

01:33:42.376 --> 01:33:45.292
- Get the table.
- Let me through.

01:33:45.376 --> 01:33:47.792
Sit him down here. Sit him down.

01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:51.667
- All right, all right.
- This... This is a travesty!

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:54.584
You are all witnesses to a criminal...
criminal travesty.

01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:56.751
Come on!

01:33:56.834 --> 01:33:59.542
I demand... I demand... Fuck you!

01:33:59.626 --> 01:34:02.126
I demand my rights under Article...

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:05.334
- Will you stop banging?
- Read it, Georgy.

01:34:05.459 --> 01:34:07.126
- Here's your trial.
- Spit it out.

01:34:07.209 --> 01:34:09.542
- Marshal?
- Comrade General Secretary!

01:34:09.667 --> 01:34:11.959
- Get on with it!
- Read it.

01:34:12.042 --> 01:34:14.334
You're judging me!
You're judging me!

01:34:14.417 --> 01:34:15.542
- I judge you!
- Fuck you!

01:34:15.626 --> 01:34:19.042
I judge you!
I judge all of you. All of you.

01:34:19.126 --> 01:34:21.209
- Where's the logic?
- Nicky, read it.

01:34:21.292 --> 01:34:22.643
Would you like me to read it for you?

01:34:22.667 --> 01:34:24.917
- Read it, Nicky.
- Come on, Nicky, read it.

01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:26.876
"You are accused

01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:28.959
"of using your position
as Minister of the Interior

01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:31.251
- "to plot against the Soviet Union...
- Traitor!

01:34:31.334 --> 01:34:35.042
...with the goal of forwarding
the interests of foreign powers."

01:34:35.126 --> 01:34:37.584
Foreign powers?
Which one, the fucking moon?

01:34:37.667 --> 01:34:40.876
"You are also accused
of 347 counts of rape,

01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:44.667
"of sexual deviancy
and bourgeois immorality

01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:48.626
and acts of perversion with children
as young as seven years old."

01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:50.126
Exotic for old Beria!

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.126
Seven years old!

01:34:52.251 --> 01:34:55.001
Rapists! Rapists! You are the rapists!

01:34:55.084 --> 01:34:56.751
Error! Error! Error!

01:34:56.834 --> 01:34:58.792
- Get on with it.
- "Petra Nikova, aged 13.

01:34:58.876 --> 01:35:03.334
"Nadia Ranova, aged 14.
Magya Holovic, aged seven."

01:35:03.459 --> 01:35:05.459
Would you like to read
the list yourself?

01:35:05.542 --> 01:35:09.251
"You are accused of treason
and anti-Soviet behaviour.

01:35:09.334 --> 01:35:12.292
The court finds you guilty
and sentences you to be shot."

01:35:12.376 --> 01:35:14.709
I rescind that.

01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:16.292
Take him out.

01:35:16.376 --> 01:35:17.626
No, please!

01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:20.584
Please, don't shoot me!
Don't hurt me.

01:35:20.792 --> 01:35:23.459
Shoot him!

01:35:23.626 --> 01:35:25.209
Get him out. Come on!

01:35:25.292 --> 01:35:27.126
Get out of here...

01:35:30.292 --> 01:35:31.584
Well, that's got it done.

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:35.167
Come on, have a look.

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:37.834
Come on.

01:35:37.917 --> 01:35:39.876
This is for us.
This is for the people.

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:41.459
Everybody happy? Proper dead?

01:35:41.959 --> 01:35:45.042
- Ruined everything, Lavrenti.
- Come on, get him up.

01:35:45.209 --> 01:35:47.167
Fuck off back to Georgia, deadboy.

01:35:47.251 --> 01:35:49.084
- On the rocks.
- It was shit knowing you.

01:35:49.167 --> 01:35:50.251
Who's got a light?

01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:52.709
Get the cans.

01:35:55.751 --> 01:35:57.311
I wish the old man
could have seen this.

01:36:01.209 --> 01:36:02.334
That'll do.

01:36:07.376 --> 01:36:08.917
Fucking hell.

01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:13.084
I'm knackered.
It's been a busy old week.

01:36:13.626 --> 01:36:17.126
You see? Old Molotov's
still got some scheming left in him.

01:36:21.959 --> 01:36:24.084
I will bury you in history.

01:36:24.167 --> 01:36:27.376
- You hear me, you fat fucker?
- That's enough.

01:36:27.459 --> 01:36:28.917
That's enough. Come on, now.

01:36:30.126 --> 01:36:33.209
You smell like rendered horse,
you burning arsehole.

01:36:35.376 --> 01:36:37.376
That's how you deal with a problem,
isn't it?

01:36:39.959 --> 01:36:41.209
I'm sorry you had to be here.

01:36:41.292 --> 01:36:44.042
I hope you didn't tell Beria that
he was going to be safe from harm.

01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:47.792
You will be safe, okay?
Vasily, too. If you listen to me.

01:36:47.876 --> 01:36:50.042
Why wouldn't we be safe?

01:36:50.126 --> 01:36:52.334
- What are you talking about?
- Just be quiet now.

01:36:52.417 --> 01:36:55.042
- I refuse to be quiet every time...
- Just shut up!

01:36:57.584 --> 01:37:00.042
Vasily stays here in Russia
where we can take care of him.

01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:02.709
Read it.

01:37:03.459 --> 01:37:04.626
Vienna?

01:37:09.292 --> 01:37:11.334
- If I stayed, I could contain Vasily.
- No. No.

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.209
No, you go to Vienna. He stays.

01:37:14.292 --> 01:37:16.209
We can't have a drunken madman

01:37:16.292 --> 01:37:18.251
spreading conspiracy theories
all over the world.

01:37:18.334 --> 01:37:20.376
- He's not... He's not bad.
- Listen to me.

01:37:20.459 --> 01:37:23.501
- He's just ill.
- No. No.

01:37:25.834 --> 01:37:27.334
You understand what's going on?

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:32.126
This is how people get killed,
when their stories don't fit.

01:37:34.834 --> 01:37:35.959
Safe travels.

01:37:40.334 --> 01:37:41.751
I never thought it would be you.

01:37:49.042 --> 01:37:50.459
Now we can turn the corner.

01:37:51.292 --> 01:37:54.626
Yeah.
Put all the bloodshed behind us.

01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:02.667
I'm worried about Malenkov, though.

01:38:05.167 --> 01:38:06.376
Can we trust him?

01:38:06.959 --> 01:38:08.751
Can you ever trust a weak man?

01:38:09.305 --> 01:38:15.274
