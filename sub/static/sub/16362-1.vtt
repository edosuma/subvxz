00:47.670 --> 00:51.220
Some people
say that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.720
They think the world is just
what you can touch and hear and see.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.475
while others say the tales and legends
cannot be dismissed.

01:01.185 --> 01:05.775
They believe with all their hearts
that fairies truly do exist.

01:07.820 --> 01:12.110
Throughout all time.
human beings and fairies never met.

01:13.155 --> 01:18.495
till one very special summer
that we shall not soon forget.

01:29.920 --> 01:35.930
(SINGING ) Life is rising up
Surging forth in all directions

01:36.100 --> 01:41.850
Every little buttercup
Is reaching out to find connections

01:42.000 --> 01:45.020
Every blade of grass
Will touch the sunlight

01:45.690 --> 01:48.480
The rain will touch the ground

01:48.690 --> 01:53.400
Growing greener than it was before

01:55.365 --> 02:01.120
Bees are droning by
Spider silk is softly spinning

02:01.288 --> 02:06.960
Not a cloud in the sky
You know it"s only the beginning

02:07.211 --> 02:13.717
Every little blossom. every flower
Flings its petals wide

02:13.884 --> 02:18.472
As the season comes round
Once more

02:19.890 --> 02:22.643
Hey, Tink! You ready
for your first summer on the mainIand?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.812
AbsoIuteIy! It"s so beautifuI out here.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.398
I can"t beIieve we get to stay
for the whoIe season.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.818
WeII, what are we waiting for?
Race you down!

02:33.070 --> 02:39.326
The breeze is blowing light and sweet
The grass. a carpet at your feet

02:39.493 --> 02:43.705
Catch the colours
Feel the heat of the sun

02:45.874 --> 02:51.922
All the sparrows in the dell
Swirling round like a carousel

02:52.214 --> 02:55.926
Singing loud enough to tell everyone

02:56.093 --> 02:57.052
Hi, guys.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.929
Summer"s just begun

03:03.183 --> 03:04.977
Summer"s just begun

03:08.272 --> 03:10.816
There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

03:10.983 --> 03:13.861
All the winters. all the springs

03:14.278 --> 03:17.114
Lead us here on fairy wings

03:17.239 --> 03:21.368
A season of a thousand things
To be done

03:21.994 --> 03:23.704
Summer"s just begun

03:28.458 --> 03:30.294
Summer"s just begun

03:33.463 --> 03:34.673
Hiya, Cheese!

03:34.840 --> 03:36.049
Summer"s just begun

03:36.216 --> 03:38.886
-Did you have a nice fIight?
Incoming!

03:39.011 --> 03:40.470
Keep her IeveI!
Keep her IeveI!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.389
Gear it down, BobbIe!

03:42.556 --> 03:43.932
Oh-ho!

03:44.099 --> 03:46.935
-Smashing Ianding, CIanky.
-Thank you, BobbIe.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.813
Guys, I think you may
have over-packed.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.900
-Come on, Tink. Let"s go inside.
-Inside?

03:53.525 --> 03:56.361
Tink, fairy camp isn"t out here
in the open.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.405
We need to stay hidden
from the humans.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.407
-We do?
-Uh. Yeah.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.076
That"s why fairy camp is in here.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.714
Cicadas, one at a time.
You, you and you. You, too.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.886
Wow. It"s Iike aII of Pixie HoIIow
under one tree!

04:34.483 --> 04:35.442
BIaze!

04:35.943 --> 04:36.944
Hmm?

05:04.388 --> 05:05.347
Wow!

05:05.514 --> 05:07.307
The Queen Anne"s Iace
is Iooking beautifuI.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.561
-How are the Iooms working?
-Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

05:10.686 --> 05:15.399
Next. Next. Next.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.986
-How"s the bee-Iiner working?
-Like a dream, Tink. Thanks.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.405
Great. Need any heIp with that wagon?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.031
No, thanks. She"s running fine.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.950
Okay. GIad to hear it.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.370
Here"s the first week"s suppIy.

05:28.537 --> 05:32.749
Okay, I"m off. I gotta go deIiver
pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

05:32.875 --> 05:35.210
but I"II see you in a coupIe days.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.089
Oh, and Tink! Don"t worry.
You"II find something to fix.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.426
I hope so.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.179
In the meantime,
I need to go find some Iost things.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.389
HoId on, IittIe miss spare parts.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.100
You"re not going near
the human house, are you?

05:50.267 --> 05:54.688
-(GASPS ) There"s a human house?
-No! I mean, yes, but no.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.524
-We stay away from humans.
-Oh, Iridessa!

05:59.151 --> 06:04.573
-Tinker BeII knows that, don"t you?
-Define ""stay away.""

06:04.740 --> 06:07.242
It"s gonna be a Iong summer.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.452
Grouchy.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.956
-Oh, that"s just Vidia being Vidia.
-No, the air. It smeIIs...

06:13.081 --> 06:14.541
...grouchy.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.045
-We might be in for a storm.
-Come on, SiI.

06:18.337 --> 06:23.175
The sun is shining, the air is warm.
It"s a beautifuI day. Nothing"s gonna...

07:11.849 --> 07:13.725
Tinker BeII.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.992
Thank goodness we"re here, Father.
It"s just Iike I remember it.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.952
WeII, of course, my darIing.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.746
Look at the creek and the woods
and the meadow!

07:36.081 --> 07:38.458
Oh! I wish it was summer aII year Iong!

07:38.834 --> 07:40.919
Yes, Lizzy.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.279
Tinker BeII, what are you doing here?

08:07.446 --> 08:11.491
Vidia, this is amazing!
It"s a carriage that moves by itseIf!

08:11.909 --> 08:13.785
There"s no horse. SeriousIy, Iook.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.996
-Do you see a horse up there?
-Uh. No.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.209
It"s a horseIess carriage!
And do you want to know how it works?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.044
-Not reaIIy.
-So do I.

08:22.336 --> 08:26.465
I think those wheeIs back there move
because this chain thing rotates.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.551
And I think what rotates the chain
is this big...

08:29.718 --> 08:33.347
I don"t care, Tinker BeII. You shouIdn"t
be this cIose to the human house.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.182
What if they see us?

08:38.602 --> 08:42.063
WiII you stop fIitting around in there?
This is serious!

08:42.688 --> 08:46.235
You know what, Vidia?
I think this powers the whoIe thing!

08:49.238 --> 08:54.576
This, my dear, is exactIy why tinkers
shouIdn"t come to the mainIand. They...

08:56.286 --> 08:57.663
Let me know if this does anything.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.586
WeII, anything? Vidia, you"re aII wet.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.548
You don"t say.

09:07.673 --> 09:11.009
Father, Father, Father! Can we
bring our tea and scones outside

09:11.176 --> 09:12.636
and have them here in the garden?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.264
-It wouId be just Iike a IittIe picnic.
Not just now, Lizzy.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.100
I stiII have to get the trunk unpacked
and the house settIed.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.353
Father, Iook!
What a magnificent butterfIy.

09:23.605 --> 09:28.151
My word. AbsoIuteIy astonishing.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.321
It"s so beautifuI.
What kind of butterfIy is it?

09:31.989 --> 09:35.951
WeII, judging from the epidermaI
membrane, it"s cIearIy an apatura iris.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.454
but the wings
have two entireIy different patterns.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.040
WeII, that"s nearIy impossibIe.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.544
WeII, I guess that"s just the way
the fairies decided to paint it.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.712
Hmm?

09:46.879 --> 09:48.797
Lizzy, fairies do not paint
butterfIy wings

09:49.298 --> 09:52.467
because, as you know,
fairies are not reaI.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.760
-Hmm!
-Ugh!

09:53.927 --> 09:54.469
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.096
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.725
-Their paint dripped aII over its wing.
-ReaIIy, darIing.

09:59.892 --> 10:03.812
RationaI peopIe consider
a beIief in fairies to be quite fooIish.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.063
The wings are so fresh.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.398
What are you doing?

10:06.565 --> 10:08.567
Its chrysaIis must have been
in the meadow.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.403
The meadow? Father, wait!

10:13.238 --> 10:16.074
That"s where I"m going.
WouId you Iike to come?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.327
Not now, Lizzy.
I have to update my fieId journaI.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.038
My interview at the museum
is tomorrow night.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.458
You"re going back aIready?
We just got here.

10:25.584 --> 10:30.005
I know, sweetheart, and I"m very sorry.
But I"II onIy be gone for the day.

10:30.255 --> 10:34.301
Mrs Perkins wiII Iook after you,
and I"II be back in time to tuck you in.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.762
-Promise?
-I promise.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.599
-Okay.
-That"s a good girI.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.945
AII cIear!

10:54.696 --> 10:55.739
Come on, Vidia.

10:55.906 --> 11:00.619
-(SIGHS ) I can"t fIy. My wings are wet.
-Oh! That"s right. Sorry.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.997
Guess you"II have to waIk back.

11:05.249 --> 11:09.378
But don"t worry, I"II keep you company.
ActuaIIy, it might be nice.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.927
Or not.
So, I think I figured out the carriage.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.304
Those bottIes of goop
must keep it running smoothIy,

11:19.471 --> 11:21.473
Iike snaiI sIime, you know?

11:21.682 --> 11:25.060
Hate to see the size of the snaiI
that stuff comes from. And at first...

12:03.390 --> 12:06.602
Here"s your house, IittIe fairies.
Wherever you are.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.941
Hmm.
Just needs a IittIe something more.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.865
But I haven"t quite figured out
what that sparky wire does.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.619
Hey! Maybe the whoIe carriage
runs on Iightning!

12:26.955 --> 12:31.251
Are those wet wings stiII bugging you?
Here, Vidia, Iet me heIp you.

12:32.794 --> 12:36.548
Tinker BeII, maybe if you spent
Iess time causing disasters,

12:36.715 --> 12:40.302
you wouIdn"t have
to heIp everybody so much.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.929
Whoa!

12:42.054 --> 12:46.642
-Hmm. The truth hurts, doesn"t it?
-Look! We can use these back at camp!

12:48.310 --> 12:51.480
Wow. These"II be perfect for the new
wagon prototype I"ve been working on.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.399
Here. I bet if I took two or three
and tied them together,

12:54.566 --> 12:57.069
I couId make one reaIIy strong wheeI!

12:57.236 --> 13:01.281
It"s a good thing we were waIking
or we might never have seen these.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.575
Vidia, where are your buttons?

13:04.117 --> 13:08.080
Tinker BeII, I am not carrying
this human junk back to camp.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.130
Ah!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.966
-Let"s go!
-Let"s go!

13:22.469 --> 13:26.682
Tinker BeII, we"re not supposed
to go near human houses.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.183
This isn"t a human house.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.434
They"re a Iot bigger.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.145
Besides, the sign says,
""Fairies weIcome.""

13:32.312 --> 13:34.898
Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.736
Tinker BeII, you"re not going in there.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.117
PIease teII me you"re not going in there!
She went in there.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.829
Oh!

13:53.375 --> 13:54.376
Wow.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.471
Tinker BeII! Don"t eat that!
This couId be a trap.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.641
Come on, Vidia. It"s perfectIy safe.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.143
Oh, reaIIy?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.027
-Oh, Vidia.
-Huh! Not so safe now, is it?

14:20.569 --> 14:23.322
Nice try, Vidia,
but you"re not scaring me.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.990
Gosh, this thing is amazing.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.117
You just don"t know when to stop,
do you?

14:30.954 --> 14:33.415
Oh, no. Tink! Someone"s coming!

14:35.083 --> 14:36.710
The door is stuck!

14:36.877 --> 14:38.837
Come on, Vidia.
You can do better than that.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.256
Tink!
-I wonder what this part does.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.301
Tink! I"m serious! Get out of there!

14:44.468 --> 14:46.303
Just a second. Just a second.

14:56.647 --> 14:59.566
Vidia? Vidia?

15:03.153 --> 15:06.073
Oh, Vidia, come on. Open the door.
You had your IittIe...

15:11.328 --> 15:13.831
Oh, no. What have I done?

15:14.498 --> 15:17.751
Vidia? Okay, not funny any more.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.009
A fairy!

15:29.888 --> 15:32.474
It"s a reaI fairy!

15:37.980 --> 15:40.065
Father! Father!

15:46.321 --> 15:47.447
Father!

15:58.750 --> 16:01.211
-Father! Father, Father!
-Yes, Lizzy.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.380
You"re never going to beIieve
what I found.

16:03.505 --> 16:07.301
-Maybe Iater, Lizzy.
-But Father, Father, Father,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.094
-Father, Father.
-Just a moment, dear.

16:09.261 --> 16:12.097
-I"m very busy with my project.
-Yes, but Father!

16:12.264 --> 16:13.724
-Father!
-Lizzy, pIease.

16:13.849 --> 16:17.477
I must add this extraordinary discovery
to my fieId journaI.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.146
And here it is.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.317
Is that the butterfIy
we were Iooking at earIier?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.153
Yes. Quite a specimen, isn"t it?

16:26.278 --> 16:28.363
You"re not going to
take it to London, are you?

16:28.530 --> 16:29.489
Yes, of course.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.241
The board of trustees
wouId never beIieve me

16:31.408 --> 16:32.534
if they didn"t see it themseIves.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.287
Now I"m sure to get that curatorship
at the museum.

16:35.454 --> 16:37.539
Besides, as a member
of the scientific community,

16:37.706 --> 16:41.627
I"m obIigated to share significant
findings Iike this with my coIIeagues.

16:41.793 --> 16:46.006
I know it"s unfortunate for the specimen,
but reaIIy, there is no other way.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.175
Now, dear.
What did you want me to see?

16:48.425 --> 16:49.384
Uh...

16:49.551 --> 16:50.802
Never mind.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.786
Where have you gone?

17:30.926 --> 17:34.221
Mr Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

17:37.933 --> 17:39.560
Mr Twitches!

17:44.940 --> 17:47.526
Bad cat! No, no, no!

17:51.488 --> 17:53.323
Don"t worry, IittIe fairy.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.160
Mr Twitches won"t bother you
as Iong as you"re in there.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.539
Naughty cat! You"re going outside.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.495
Tinker BeII"s
been captured by humans!

19:22.955 --> 19:24.081
-Oh, no.
-What happened? Is she okay?

19:24.248 --> 19:25.415
-Is she aII right?
-What"s this? Tinker BeII?

19:25.582 --> 19:26.959
-What happened, Vidia?
-Is she hurt?

19:27.125 --> 19:30.587
Tinker BeII went into this IittIe house
in the meadow and couIdn"t get out.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.464
The door got jammed.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.467
Then this human came from out
of nowhere and snatched her up,

19:35.634 --> 19:38.470
but I know where she is.
We have to hurry and save her.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.848
Then we better Ieave right away!

19:45.477 --> 19:47.312
SiI, do you think the storm
wiII pass soon?

19:47.479 --> 19:49.982
No, it Iooks Iike it"s gonna get stronger.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.150
WeII, there"s gotta be some way
to get to Tink.

19:52.317 --> 19:55.237
We can"t fIy in the rain,
and the meadow"s aIready fIooded.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.114
Maybe we don"t have to fIy.

19:57.239 --> 20:01.285
If we get some big Ieaves and sew them
together with stem twine...

20:01.660 --> 20:03.704
And mitre-cut some twigs
for the sub-fIooring.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.164
Acorns as counterweights.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.583
Some quick-dry mapIe sap
as reinforcement.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.209
What are you two taIking about?

20:09.334 --> 20:12.337
-We"re gonna buiId a boat!
-We"re gonna buiId a boat!

20:21.430 --> 20:25.184
More mushroom caps, pIease!
-Here we go.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.981
This one goes there.
That one goes there. Right?

20:32.482 --> 20:34.234
Righty-o, BobbIe.

20:47.581 --> 20:50.709
Right, more reeds over here.
-This thing had better work.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.169
Give me the sap.

20:52.336 --> 20:55.088
You dip it in this way
and give it a big sIap Iike so.

20:57.341 --> 21:00.177
Ow. Ow. Ow.

21:00.344 --> 21:02.679
Come on. Come on.
Let"s get going.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.601
There you go.
Now you"re taIking!

21:14.691 --> 21:16.068
It"s working!

21:24.493 --> 21:25.869
WeII, this is it.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.749
Hey, faith...

21:31.166 --> 21:32.334
Trust...

21:32.501 --> 21:34.044
-And pixie dust.
-Pixie dust.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.135
Come on. Come on.

21:48.809 --> 21:49.935
HeIIo.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.776
You don"t have to be scared.
I"m very nice.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.115
You"re so IittIe.

22:03.824 --> 22:07.703
Your dress is very Ieafy.
Did you make it yourseIf?

22:08.537 --> 22:11.623
I Iike your wings.
They"re Iike sparkIy Iace.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.126
Your hair must be so soft.

22:16.503 --> 22:20.966
Are you hungry? Maybe not.
That"s okay.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.719
I don"t Iike some kinds of food, either.

22:25.679 --> 22:26.722
Oh!

22:26.889 --> 22:29.808
I"m so sorry. Where are my manners?

22:31.393 --> 22:32.769
There you go.

22:40.152 --> 22:45.574
Wait! Wait! Wait! No, pIease!
I"m not going to hurt you!

22:47.242 --> 22:51.288
Don"t be afraid!
I just want to be your friend!

22:53.332 --> 22:58.086
I reaIIy won"t hurt you. I just Iove fairies.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.216
I"ve been drawing fairies
aII my Iife. See?

23:03.258 --> 23:07.387
I drew that one when I was three,
but I did that green one Iast week.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.599
I think it"s much better.

23:11.266 --> 23:14.895
I even started to paint
with the watercoIours Father gave me.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.566
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfIy wings?

23:22.486 --> 23:23.737
I knew it!

23:24.488 --> 23:27.032
These are some
of my favourite drawings.

23:27.324 --> 23:28.784
This is a water fairy.

23:28.951 --> 23:32.079
-You can teII because her skin is bIue.
-BIue?

23:32.371 --> 23:35.541
And here is a candy fairy
Iiving in a IoIIipop tree.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.584
Do aII fairies Iive in trees
made of sweets?

23:40.337 --> 23:43.423
ReaIIy? What about fairy circIes?

23:45.717 --> 23:48.303
WeII, I hear
that if a person steps in one,

23:48.470 --> 23:52.057
a fairy has to grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.436
But if they don"t,
they turn into a piIe of deIicious sugar,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.188
-and then younger fairies...
-(LAUGHS ) Wait. Wait a minute.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.732
-...must try and turn them back into...
-Where are you getting aII this?

24:03.110 --> 24:06.530
You jingIe when you taIk,
Iike a IittIe beII!

24:06.864 --> 24:08.949
So that"s how fairies speak.

24:10.742 --> 24:14.121
So what do you think of my fairies?
Oh! And my fairy house!

24:17.541 --> 24:19.459
It got a IittIe shaken up.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.633
-Did you make this?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.510
I don"t know what you"re saying.

24:33.974 --> 24:38.770
Oh. Did I make the fairy house?
Yes, I did. Do you Iike it?

24:42.566 --> 24:44.818
Oh. The door"s stuck.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.953
WeII, you"re quite the IittIe tinker,
aren"t you?

24:55.370 --> 24:58.790
What? Is that your name? Tinker?

25:01.251 --> 25:02.211
Er...

25:02.377 --> 25:05.214
BeII? Your name is BeII.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.594
Tinker? BeII?

25:12.596 --> 25:16.099
Tinker BeII? Tinker BeII.

25:17.434 --> 25:22.606
What a IoveIy name!
WeII, Tinker BeII, my name"s Lizzy.

25:27.194 --> 25:30.030
Do aII fairies sound the same
when they taIk?

25:31.365 --> 25:34.034
How do you Iearn to be a fairy?
Do you go to fairy schooI?

25:34.159 --> 25:35.160
Lizzy?

25:36.453 --> 25:39.122
Lizzy? Who are you taIking to?

25:40.874 --> 25:42.251
Oh. Um...

25:43.168 --> 25:44.378
My fairy!

25:46.463 --> 25:50.884
That"s nice, dear. Now, I brought you
something I think you"II reaIIy enjoy.

25:51.051 --> 25:54.346
These are some
of my oId fieId journaIs.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.349
Now, I picked out the ones
I thought wouId excite you the most.

25:57.516 --> 26:01.812
This one on rocks and mineraIs
is particuIarIy interesting.

26:02.062 --> 26:06.400
-Is there a fieId journaI about fairies?
-(LAUGHS ) Of course not, Lizzy.

26:07.025 --> 26:10.571
Books Iike this are based on fact
and scientific research,

26:11.321 --> 26:14.408
which is quite the contrary
to your IittIe figurines and drawings.

26:14.533 --> 26:18.579
WeII, just because you"ve never seen
a fairy doesn"t mean they"re not reaI.

26:18.704 --> 26:24.835
Now, Lizzy, seeing is beIieving,
and without proof, it"s just a fairy taIe.

26:25.252 --> 26:30.507
Now, here is a bIank fieId journaI.
Now, you"re very taIented, my darIing,

26:31.133 --> 26:35.345
and I"m sure you"II be abIe to fiII it
with your own scientific research.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.805
Yes, Father.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.145
Now if onIy these Ieaks
were just pretend.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.608
Tinker BeII, you can come out now.

26:51.528 --> 26:57.284
Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me
your coIIection, but I reaIIy shouId be...

26:59.495 --> 27:00.954
You want to go?

27:02.039 --> 27:04.791
Oh. I reaIIy wish you"d stay.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.169
I"m sorry, Lizzy.

27:08.504 --> 27:10.714
Okay, I understand.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.599
So, I guess this is goodbye.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.481
What"s wrong?
Can"t you fIy in the rain?

27:30.734 --> 27:33.111
You can stay with me
untiI the rain stops.

27:33.278 --> 27:36.657
I"II show you around my room.
We can pIay with my toys.

27:36.824 --> 27:38.617
We"II have so much fun.

27:45.749 --> 27:49.586
-We"re past the shaIIows!
-Aye! Drop the mainsaiI!

27:49.920 --> 27:51.672
Dropping the mainsaiI!

27:52.548 --> 27:54.883
-Trim the saiI!
-Trimming the saiI!

27:59.179 --> 28:04.601
-Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port!
-Hard to port! Hard to port!

28:11.942 --> 28:14.778
I recognise that wagon.
Stay on this course!

28:15.112 --> 28:18.782
-Aye, Miss Vidia. WiII do.
-I sure hope Tink is aII right.

28:19.074 --> 28:22.494
Who knows what terribIe things
couId be happening to her right now.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.291
A fairy couId get used to this.

28:27.457 --> 28:32.296
Isn"t it wonderfuI? Everything in this
house is just your size, Tinker BeII.

28:34.548 --> 28:37.301
That"s perfume. It smeIIs Iike fIowers.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.805
Oh. My doII.
She shouId be in bed by now.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.142
How oId are you? I"m nine.

28:46.977 --> 28:50.898
Do you Iike my doIIhouse?
Do fairies Iive in houses?

28:52.316 --> 28:54.651
What are fairies" houses made of?

28:55.319 --> 28:58.071
That"s a cooker,
but it doesn"t actuaIIy work.

28:58.238 --> 29:01.909
What"s your favourite food?
I mean, besides sweets?

29:03.076 --> 29:05.996
I want to know aII about reaI Iive fairies.

29:13.212 --> 29:14.379
Perfect!

29:16.590 --> 29:21.261
""Scientific fairy research.""

29:22.346 --> 29:24.681
Okay. What"s your favourite coIour?

29:27.392 --> 29:29.645
Green is my favourite coIour, too!

29:31.438 --> 29:35.192
I shouId start from the beginning.
Where do fairies come from?

29:35.359 --> 29:37.194
I mean, where were you born?

29:37.361 --> 29:38.362
Oh.

29:38.529 --> 29:41.824
WeII, that one"s
a IittIe more compIicated because...

29:42.282 --> 29:44.117
So, a baby, when it Iaughs
for the first time...

29:46.995 --> 29:48.247
A fairy...

29:49.414 --> 29:51.375
-Uh... Uh...
-Oh.

29:51.625 --> 29:54.378
Right. One second.

30:00.092 --> 30:02.511
You were a funny-Iooking baby?

30:05.639 --> 30:06.765
A baby?

30:09.893 --> 30:10.853
Laughs?

30:14.273 --> 30:15.274
One?

30:18.193 --> 30:19.278
First?

30:19.570 --> 30:26.034
When a baby Iaughs for the first time,
that"s when a fairy is born.

30:28.704 --> 30:29.997
IncredibIe.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.917
Lizzy, that"s onIy the beginning.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.671
(SINGING )
Guess I always knew

30:38.255 --> 30:42.384
This could all come true

30:42.509 --> 30:45.512
Still it feels so new

30:46.388 --> 30:49.057
Being here with you

30:50.392 --> 30:53.478
Can"t believe my eyes

30:54.354 --> 30:57.733
A new world comes alive

30:58.150 --> 31:02.279
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

31:02.446 --> 31:05.949
We"ll live happy ever after

31:06.325 --> 31:10.954
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

31:11.121 --> 31:17.336
Because you showed me
How to believe

31:24.384 --> 31:27.221
More than just pretend

31:27.888 --> 31:31.683
I"ll make believe again

31:32.184 --> 31:35.229
I hope this never ends

31:36.438 --> 31:39.107
Maybe we"ll be friends

31:39.942 --> 31:44.154
Now everything I know
Everything I know

31:44.279 --> 31:48.075
I"ll never let it go
Never let it go

31:48.242 --> 31:52.287
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

31:52.412 --> 31:56.208
We"ll live happy ever after

31:56.375 --> 32:00.921
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

32:01.171 --> 32:07.594
Because you showed me
How to believe

32:19.398 --> 32:21.400
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

32:21.942 --> 32:25.237
This road shouId take us straight
to the human house.

32:25.487 --> 32:28.657
So how far is it from the road
to the house, do you think?

32:28.824 --> 32:33.036
Not that far, reaIIy.
The onIy question is, how fIooded is it?

32:33.412 --> 32:35.122
That"s a good point.

32:36.915 --> 32:39.251
WeII, I"m gonna remain optimistic.

32:39.835 --> 32:42.963
-We"II get to Tink in no time.
I"m with you, SiI.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.466
We"re aImost there.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.386
Why, Iook,
we"re picking up speed aIready.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.389
Did you feeI that?
We"re moving faster.

32:57.561 --> 33:01.315
Hey, guys!
We"re heading right for a waterfaII!

33:05.194 --> 33:07.946
Great poIIiwogs!
We have to make the turn!

33:08.238 --> 33:10.782
Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

33:11.867 --> 33:12.826
What?

33:12.993 --> 33:16.121
Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

33:16.288 --> 33:17.372
-What?
What did he say?

33:17.539 --> 33:19.082
Loosen the ropes and...

33:19.208 --> 33:21.210
...turn the saiI!

33:21.960 --> 33:23.670
-Oh, no!
-Look out!

33:26.840 --> 33:28.217
Man overboard!

33:31.845 --> 33:33.889
Hard to port! Hard to port!

33:35.557 --> 33:37.684
Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

33:40.854 --> 33:43.232
Guys! We"re running out of river!

33:45.150 --> 33:47.903
That"s aII right,
"cause aII we need"s a IittIe.

33:48.070 --> 33:50.656
-Rosetta, come grab my feet.
-What?

33:54.785 --> 33:57.454
Hang on! We"re going straight down!

33:59.164 --> 34:00.123
Oh, no!

34:03.293 --> 34:04.837
Brace yourseIves!

34:26.775 --> 34:30.612
-Who"s aIive?
-Not me.

34:31.655 --> 34:35.199
Me, either. I can"t find a puIse!
It"s not there!

34:35.492 --> 34:38.661
I"m teIIing you, I don"t...
Oh. I"m good.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.083
Oh!

34:44.001 --> 34:44.960
Ow!

34:45.127 --> 34:47.129
Oh! Sorry!

34:47.337 --> 34:48.297
Ow!

34:49.255 --> 34:51.382
Looks Iike we"re waIking from here.

34:52.009 --> 34:56.054
-But... WaIking where?
-We couId be anywhere.

34:56.763 --> 34:59.433
Everything Iooks the same
from down here.

34:59.850 --> 35:02.853
And there"s no way of knowing
which way to go.

35:02.978 --> 35:05.480
CIank! Where did you find that?

35:06.815 --> 35:10.319
I don"t know. Here on the ground.
Is it yours?

35:20.412 --> 35:22.122
I know where we are.

35:25.501 --> 35:29.171
Tinker BeII, this is so fascinating.
Thank you.

35:30.005 --> 35:33.884
I had no idea fairies were responsibIe
for changing the seasons.

35:34.593 --> 35:37.137
I thought it had something to do
with the Earth"s axis

35:37.304 --> 35:39.097
as it rotated around the sun.

35:39.264 --> 35:41.517
That"s what we wanted you to think.

35:42.309 --> 35:47.648
WeII, I think we"ve covered everything.
Oh. I hope Father"s impressed.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.692
And now, for the finaIe.

35:51.944 --> 35:54.863
The whoIe fairy Iand, Pixie HoIIow.

35:59.409 --> 36:03.705
It worked!
Tinker BeII, I can"t wait to show Father.

36:05.541 --> 36:10.212
Tinker BeII? Are you aII right?
Tinker BeII?

36:10.379 --> 36:11.421
Huh?

36:11.588 --> 36:14.883
Oh. Sorry. Yeah, Iet"s go show your dad.

36:28.814 --> 36:31.275
Looks Iike the rain has Iet up some.

36:31.775 --> 36:34.444
You might be abIe to make it home
to your friends now.

36:39.199 --> 36:41.160
Maybe this couId heIp you.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.457
Oh, yes.

36:52.296 --> 36:53.672
Such a cIever tinker.

36:58.385 --> 37:00.137
Take care of yourseIf.

37:10.189 --> 37:12.608
I"II never forget you, Tinker BeII.

37:16.778 --> 37:20.491
You"d best hurry. The break
in the weather may not Iast Iong.

37:39.259 --> 37:40.219
Goodbye.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.936
And I"II never forget you, Lizzy.

37:53.941 --> 37:57.027
- Father, Iook!
- Not just now, Lizzy.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.112
My hands are rather fuII at the moment.

37:59.279 --> 38:03.492
I made it especiaIIy for you, Father.
It"s just Iike your fieId journaI.

38:03.659 --> 38:06.245
-It"s fiIIed with Iots of facts.
-Yes, yes, that sounds wonderfuI,

38:06.411 --> 38:09.081
but I"m in the middIe
of a potentiaI catastrophe here.

38:09.206 --> 38:10.457
I can"t Iook at it now.

38:10.624 --> 38:13.836
-But Father, it"s a fieId journaI, and I...
-I don"t have time.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.463
I have to find some way
to deaI with aII these Ieaks

38:16.630 --> 38:18.382
before they destroy my work.

38:18.549 --> 38:23.595
-When wiII you be abIe to Iook at it?
-(GROANS ) I don"t know. Maybe Iater.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.515
You aIways say that.

39:16.148 --> 39:17.274
Tinker BeII!

39:19.860 --> 39:23.614
You came back! I"m so gIad to see you.

39:27.242 --> 39:30.787
Tinker BeII, Father has no time
for the fieId journaI.

39:34.374 --> 39:36.168
I think I can fix that.

39:38.545 --> 39:40.923
Vidia, you sure you know
where you"re going?

39:41.089 --> 39:43.634
Yes. Tinker BeII
and I waIked by here.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.344
I just have to find the road.

39:45.636 --> 39:47.179
Road? What road?

39:49.640 --> 39:50.891
That road!

39:52.392 --> 39:55.479
That"s not a road. That"s a muddy river.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.148
So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.693
Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

40:02.402 --> 40:04.780
It"s not deep. We can waIk across.

40:07.115 --> 40:09.868
Yeah, no. I don"t reaIIy do mud.

40:10.953 --> 40:15.499
-But you"re a garden fairy!
-(LAUGHS ) Ironic, isn"t it?

40:15.791 --> 40:16.834
Rosetta!

40:17.000 --> 40:19.044
Okay, aII right. I"m coming.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.927
It"s squishy. Oh! What was that?

40:34.852 --> 40:36.061
She"s stuck!

40:36.603 --> 40:38.856
I can get myseIf out of here.

40:41.817 --> 40:43.193
AII right, aII right.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.737
Someone just get me something
to grab onto.

40:45.904 --> 40:50.617
-Got it! CIanky, rescue device.
-Right, BobbIe. You can count on us!

40:52.452 --> 40:54.955
Okay. Let"s give this a try.

40:59.251 --> 41:01.170
Do you feeI that?
She"s starting to break free.

41:01.336 --> 41:02.880
I don"t think so.

41:07.467 --> 41:10.220
-Come on, hurry!
-PuII! PuII!

41:12.306 --> 41:13.348
PuII!

41:20.564 --> 41:21.565
PuII!

41:35.579 --> 41:38.665
HeIIo? Is somebody out there?

41:41.001 --> 41:42.085
Anyone?

41:46.089 --> 41:49.009
-Grab this! Hurry!
-Are you kidding me?

41:49.426 --> 41:51.386
Trust me. And hoId on tight.

41:53.555 --> 41:54.765
Oh, weII.

42:07.444 --> 42:08.445
We got the...

42:09.947 --> 42:13.992
-...rescue device.
-You scared the petaIs right off of me!

42:15.619 --> 42:17.329
Did we miss anything?

42:18.789 --> 42:23.293
""My, what a spIendid tea service.
I am reaIIy quite impressed.""

42:23.877 --> 42:25.337
Then I say,

42:25.462 --> 42:28.382
""Why, thank you, Tinker BeII.

42:29.383 --> 42:31.051
""You are too kind.""

42:32.135 --> 42:35.138
You hoId your pinkie out, Iike this,

42:36.431 --> 42:42.896
and that"s the way
you throw a proper tea party.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.072
Good night, Lizzy.

43:04.710 --> 43:06.003
There we... Oh!

43:07.838 --> 43:09.381
I"m going to bed.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.977
There just aren"t enough hours
in the day.

45:48.415 --> 45:52.377
Oh. Good morning, Tinker BeII.
How did you sIeep Iast night?

45:52.544 --> 45:56.340
WeII, I... ActuaIIy, I didn"t,
but that doesn"t matter.

45:56.507 --> 45:58.175
You shouId go downstairs
to your father.

45:59.801 --> 46:01.845
-Lizzy?
-Yes, Father?

46:02.262 --> 46:05.849
Good morning, my dear.
AII the Ieaks seem to have stopped.

46:06.350 --> 46:08.852
I just wanted to make sure
everything is okay in here.

46:10.312 --> 46:14.358
Yes. Just fine. No Ieaks at aII. So...

46:14.983 --> 46:17.736
Strange.
It"s as if they mended themseIves.

46:19.863 --> 46:21.615
It"s stiII raining outside.

46:21.782 --> 46:24.701
I can"t imagine how on Earth
such a thing couId occur.

46:26.912 --> 46:30.123
WeII, there must be an expIanation
that I"m just not thinking of.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.626
WeII, I"m sure you"II think of it, Father.

46:32.793 --> 46:34.336
-Off we go.
-Perhaps down in your study.

46:34.503 --> 46:36.964
You aIways do your best thinking there.
I wish you Iuck.

46:37.130 --> 46:40.884
-Okay, weII, pIay niceIy.
-Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

46:43.470 --> 46:45.097
Oh! That was cIose.

46:45.389 --> 46:47.975
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

46:54.231 --> 46:56.900
Is that why you fixed those Ieaks?

46:59.027 --> 47:01.280
So he can spend more time with me?

47:03.657 --> 47:06.410
I"ve reaIIy been wanting
to show him this.

47:08.078 --> 47:09.955
Okay, okay. I"II go.

47:15.961 --> 47:17.963
Father, since you have more time,

47:18.130 --> 47:20.382
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

47:20.549 --> 47:23.302
- The butterfIy. It"s gone!
- What?

47:23.635 --> 47:26.388
The apatura iris
with the irreguIar wing pattern.

47:26.513 --> 47:28.682
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

47:28.849 --> 47:32.311
Oh! This was my big opportunity,
and now it"s gone.

47:33.437 --> 47:37.107
-EIizabeth, did you reIease it?
-No.

47:38.525 --> 47:40.235
WeII, I didn"t do it.

47:40.861 --> 47:42.654
And since there is no one eIse
in the house,

47:42.821 --> 47:45.365
there is onIy one IogicaI expIanation.

47:46.950 --> 47:49.953
-It must have been you.
-I didn"t do it, Father.

47:50.537 --> 47:54.666
I"m going to give you one more chance.
TeII me the truth.

47:56.335 --> 48:01.131
I couId teII you, Father,
but you wouIdn"t beIieve me.

48:04.426 --> 48:10.224
Very weII. Off to your room, young Iady.
I"m very disappointed in you.

48:16.021 --> 48:19.107
You know, I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

48:19.608 --> 48:22.361
-how not quiet it wouId be right now.
-You can say that again.

48:23.695 --> 48:26.156
Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

48:32.120 --> 48:33.956
That"s the exact shade!

48:35.874 --> 48:38.460
Quite a bit of spirit
in that IittIe tinker, eh?

48:38.627 --> 48:42.673
That"s for sure. In fact,
I stiII can"t beIieve she got captured.

48:42.840 --> 48:46.093
Yeah. It"s very unIike Tink
to be caught with her guard down.

48:46.260 --> 48:49.471
-I wonder what reaIIy happened.
-WeII, we"II find out soon.

48:49.638 --> 48:54.017
Yep. With every step we take we come
cIoser and cIoser to Tinker BeII.

48:54.434 --> 48:56.353
She"II teII us what happened.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.857
Listen, there"s
something you aII shouId know.

49:02.151 --> 49:03.986
Tinker BeII getting trapped
is aII my fauIt!

49:05.529 --> 49:08.448
I sIammed that door on Tinker BeII,
to teach her a Iesson.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.951
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

49:11.118 --> 49:16.456
I tried, but I couIdn"t, and now
I"ve put her and aII of us in danger.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.002
I am so sorry.

49:23.964 --> 49:26.049
Honey, this is not your fauIt.

49:26.216 --> 49:29.386
We aII know that Tink can get
into pIenty of troubIe aII by herseIf.

49:29.553 --> 49:33.599
It scares me to think what wouId have
happened if you weren"t there, Vidia.

49:33.724 --> 49:35.559
I don"t know what to say.

49:35.726 --> 49:39.354
-How about faith...
-Trust...

49:39.771 --> 49:41.064
-And...
-And...

49:41.231 --> 49:43.108
And pixie dust.

49:43.317 --> 49:45.235
And pixie dust!

49:45.402 --> 49:46.778
Can you reach it, CIanky?

49:48.113 --> 49:50.866
AImost. Just a IittIe more.
-Here, Iet me.

49:51.783 --> 49:54.036
Okay. Now, can you see anything?

49:54.369 --> 49:57.539
No! There"s a big buiIding in the way.

49:58.165 --> 50:03.212
BuiIding. It"s a house.
That"s it! CIanky! We"ve got it!

50:03.378 --> 50:05.547
- What"ve we got?
- House! Get off.

50:05.714 --> 50:07.841
- I"m sorry.
- I can"t feeI my Iegs.

50:12.679 --> 50:17.809
It doesn"t matter what I say.
He never beIieves me.

50:19.895 --> 50:21.605
I"m so sorry, Lizzy.

50:24.942 --> 50:26.819
I"m so gIad you"re here.

50:28.195 --> 50:29.988
You"re my best friend.

50:37.621 --> 50:40.624
I wish I were a fairy, just Iike you.

50:42.376 --> 50:45.379
Then I couId heIp the fIowers bIoom
and taIk to animaIs

50:45.546 --> 50:48.674
and fIy around with the other fairies
aII the time.

50:54.054 --> 50:55.639
That wouId be fun.

51:07.609 --> 51:09.236
Where are we going?

52:06.251 --> 52:07.294
Oh!

52:12.382 --> 52:14.134
What is going on up there?

52:24.061 --> 52:25.103
Whoa!

52:29.358 --> 52:31.777
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

52:31.944 --> 52:33.654
Now the butterfIy is gone.

52:34.696 --> 52:35.739
Whoa!

52:45.374 --> 52:46.416
Whoa!

52:56.426 --> 53:01.306
Oh, my! I"m... I"m fIying!

53:03.225 --> 53:04.476
Whoa!

53:05.269 --> 53:09.189
Look at me! Whee! I"m a fairy!

53:19.783 --> 53:21.034
AII cIear!

53:26.748 --> 53:28.125
Sorry.
-Oh! CarefuI.

53:28.250 --> 53:29.376
-That"s my ear.
Sorry.

53:29.543 --> 53:30.836
Sorry.
-That"s the nose. CarefuI.

53:31.003 --> 53:32.546
Whoops! Sorry.
-Can"t see!

53:32.880 --> 53:36.508
Okay. Tinker BeII is upstairs.
The IittIe girI has her in a cage.

53:36.675 --> 53:38.218
In a cage?

53:38.343 --> 53:40.137
And there"s aIso a Iarge human
in the house

53:40.304 --> 53:44.808
who doesn"t Iike creatures with wings.
He pins them up in dispIay cases.

53:45.642 --> 53:49.271
-Great. Anything eIse?
-Oh, yes. The cat.

53:49.563 --> 53:51.148
Cat! What cat?

53:51.773 --> 53:53.484
-That cat!
-That cat!

53:57.696 --> 54:01.325
Fawn, you"re an animaI fairy.
What are we supposed to do?

54:03.327 --> 54:05.287
Fawn?
-FIy!

54:05.454 --> 54:06.413
Our wings are wet.

54:06.580 --> 54:07.831
And who knows when they"II be dry.

54:07.998 --> 54:09.708
Okay, okay. Run!

54:22.554 --> 54:24.556
-CIank!
-Come on!

54:24.723 --> 54:25.724
Whoa!

54:29.019 --> 54:32.314
CIank!
-I"m okay.

54:34.149 --> 54:36.985
We stiII need to get to that stairweII.
Any ideas?

54:37.110 --> 54:39.029
If we couId just buiId a bridge
or something.

54:39.196 --> 54:42.032
-That"s it. A bridge!
Guys? Guys?

54:42.241 --> 54:44.576
-A bridge made out of what?
Guys!

54:46.495 --> 54:48.413
CIank! You"re a genius!

54:48.914 --> 54:50.457
Huh? Uh.

54:52.668 --> 54:53.877
It was nothing.

54:57.005 --> 54:59.091
AII right. Let"s do this.

55:08.851 --> 55:13.230
-We need some more pIates!
-Okay. Start passing them up, CIanky.

55:13.689 --> 55:17.109
Aye, aye! Here they come!

55:20.279 --> 55:22.948
Get ready for more. Oh, heIIo!

55:25.033 --> 55:27.035
We"ve got a fuII pIate back here!

55:27.244 --> 55:30.831
No, no, no. No. No, pIease.

55:31.373 --> 55:32.332
Get back!

55:47.097 --> 55:48.140
Get back!

55:48.307 --> 55:51.310
Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

55:51.852 --> 55:54.980
That is exactIy
what you think it is. Catnip!

55:55.689 --> 55:58.150
You get to Tink
and we"II take care of the cat!

55:58.317 --> 55:59.276
Got it!

56:07.534 --> 56:08.535
Whoa!

56:17.419 --> 56:19.421
- Lizzy?
- Coming, Father!

56:19.880 --> 56:23.634
-Lizzy?
-Why, heIIo, Father. May I heIp you?

56:23.926 --> 56:26.053
-What"s going on in here?
-Nothing.

56:26.220 --> 56:30.349
Nothing? Sounds Iike a herd of
eIephants have been marching up here.

56:32.351 --> 56:35.813
Look at this room.
It Iooks Iike a cycIone hit it.

56:36.647 --> 56:39.316
-It"s not that bad.
-Not that bad?

56:40.108 --> 56:42.778
Your books are aII over the fIoor,
your toys are everywhere

56:42.945 --> 56:45.531
and you tore your curtains. What?

56:46.615 --> 56:49.451
How did you get footprints
on the ceiIing?

56:50.035 --> 56:51.578
This is simpIy too much.

56:51.745 --> 56:54.832
A temper tantrum of this magnitude
is unacceptabIe.

56:54.957 --> 56:56.667
But I wasn"t having a tantrum!

56:56.792 --> 56:59.878
Then how did this happen?
And the truth this time.

57:00.671 --> 57:04.883
If I teII you the truth,
you stiII won"t beIieve me.

57:05.467 --> 57:07.177
EIizabeth, the truth.

57:08.762 --> 57:11.849
I was fIying. My fairy showed me how.

57:12.015 --> 57:16.353
Oh, for goodness sake.
Your make-beIieve fairy did this?

57:16.520 --> 57:18.689
You"ve got to stop this nonsense!

57:18.856 --> 57:21.316
But it"s not nonsense, Father.
It"s the truth!

57:21.483 --> 57:23.485
You have a reaI fairy
Iiving in your room?

57:23.652 --> 57:25.529
Yes! And I can prove it.

57:28.782 --> 57:31.076
Just Iook at the research we did.

57:35.747 --> 57:38.584
EIizabeth. This is what
you"ve been doing?

57:39.585 --> 57:42.921
FieId journaIs are to be fiIIed with fact,
not fairy taIes.

57:43.088 --> 57:45.090
But Father, these are facts!

57:45.632 --> 57:49.261
I don"t understand this fooIishness,
Lizzy. You have such taIent.

57:49.428 --> 57:54.474
-Why wouId you waste it this way?
-Why can"t you just beIieve me?

57:54.641 --> 57:56.435
I beIieve in what is reaI,

57:56.602 --> 57:59.521
and it"s about time
you started doing the same.

57:59.688 --> 58:01.064
Father, wait!

58:01.565 --> 58:04.318
I know this is difficuIt for you
to understand,

58:04.443 --> 58:06.945
but this is aII make-beIieve.

58:07.112 --> 58:10.282
-No! They"re reaI!
-EIizabeth, this discussion is over.

58:11.950 --> 58:13.243
But Father!

58:22.461 --> 58:25.214
It... It...

58:26.381 --> 58:29.885
See? I toId you. Fairies are reaI!

58:34.348 --> 58:37.100
It"s okay. She won"t hurt you.

58:39.686 --> 58:42.815
It"s... WeII, it"s extraordinary!

58:43.148 --> 58:45.150
Aren"t her wings beautifuI?

58:45.317 --> 58:49.363
Yes. Very simiIar to Apoidea.
Or, no, no, odonata.

58:49.905 --> 58:53.283
Look at the Iimb proportionaIity
to the craniaI radius.

58:53.575 --> 58:55.828
-Fascinating!
-Isn"t she magicaI?

58:56.411 --> 58:59.331
She"s some sort
of evoIutionary mutation.

58:59.623 --> 59:01.792
She"s not a bug, she"s a person.

59:01.959 --> 59:03.168
ExactIy!
-Tinker BeII!

59:03.335 --> 59:05.254
This is going to be
the discovery of the century!

59:05.420 --> 59:06.463
Tink, watch out!

59:06.630 --> 59:08.632
-Vidia?
-Get out of the way!

59:11.760 --> 59:14.429
I must get this to the museum
right away!

59:14.596 --> 59:15.848
Father, no!

59:16.682 --> 59:18.684
PIease, Father! Wait!

59:21.728 --> 59:21.979
-You can"t do this!
-Lizzy, I don"t have much time.

59:21.979 --> 59:24.648
-You can"t do this!
-Lizzy, I don"t have much time.

59:25.190 --> 59:27.568
The trustees wiII onIy wait for me
untiI 9:00.

59:27.734 --> 59:29.570
PIease, go back in the house.

59:29.736 --> 59:32.865
Don"t worry.
Mrs Perkins wiII be here any second.

59:38.328 --> 59:40.747
Tinker BeII, I"m so sorry!

59:41.290 --> 59:44.042
My father"s taking your friend
to the city!

59:46.086 --> 59:47.462
Step, step, step.

59:49.298 --> 59:50.757
-Tinker BeII?
-Tinker BeII!

59:51.133 --> 59:52.926
Look, it"s your friends.

59:53.927 --> 59:57.723
-Hurry.
-That"s it. Good kitty.

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:05.564
Look, Lizzy"s father trapped Vidia
in a jar whiIe she was saving me.

01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:08.484
-We have to hurry and rescue her.
-Here we go again!

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:11.278
-How are we gonna get there?
-Yeah, it"s stiII raining.

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:15.782
Maybe we can"t fIy in the rain,
but I think I know someone who can.

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:28.795
I"m scared, Tinker BeII.

01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:33.300
FIoating around my room is one thing,
but fIying aII the way to London...

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.138
That easy, huh?

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:41.767
Okay. I"II be brave.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:46.271
AII right, fairies.
We need aII the pixie dust we can get.

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:49.274
This girI"s got a Iong journey
ahead of her.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.703
AII aboard!

01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:05.874
Ready?

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.292
Whoa!

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:09.002
This better work.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.174
Oh! Sorry, fairies.

01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.468
Whoa! Oh!

01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:18.804
Whoa!

01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:23.767
Whoa!

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:25.018
CarefuI now!

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:30.149
Hi, Mrs Perkins. Bye, Mrs Perkins.

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:33.152
Bye, dear. FIy back soon.

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:57.384
Whoa!

01:02:02.556 --> 01:02:04.099
Oh! Good idea.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:16.904
Oh!

01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:30.834
Whoa!

01:02:47.059 --> 01:02:48.101
Sorry!

01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:50.395
Out of the way!

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:55.609
There he is!

01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:04.034
Tinker BeII, I can"t keep up.
He"s going too fast.

01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:22.469
Tink! Tinker BeII, no!

01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:25.157
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:30.204
Come on, pIease, Iet them stiII be there.

01:04:37.878 --> 01:04:41.048
Father!
-What in the worId?

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:42.633
Father, stop!

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:45.135
Don"t take her in there!

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:50.974
It... It... It... It can"t be.

01:04:55.646 --> 01:04:58.857
Lizzy? You"re fIying.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.693
Yes, I am.

01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:07.199
But how? How are you doing that?

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.329
My friends showed me how.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.921
I... I don"t understand.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.757
You don"t have to understand.

01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:27.427
You just have to beIieve.

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:33.892
I do beIieve.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.770
I do beIieve!

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.439
Oh! Father!

01:05:42.067 --> 01:05:44.444
Lizzy, I"m so sorry, I"m so sorry.

01:05:45.737 --> 01:05:48.991
I"II never doubt you again.

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:04.548
Vidia!

01:06:10.345 --> 01:06:12.764
-Let"s go home, Father.
-But how?

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:19.938
Think happy thoughts.

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:25.360
Whoa! Whoa!

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:28.947
-Lift your arms and kick your feet!
CarefuI!

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:31.783
Whoa!

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:36.580
I think I"m getting the hang of it. Yes!
Why, I"m fIying!

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:43.212
-You"re doing it, Father! You"re doing it!
-I couId get used to this! Just a second.

01:06:43.879 --> 01:06:46.840
There"s something
I"ve aIways wanted to do. FoIIow me!

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:18.872
-Hey, Tink.
-Hey, Vidia.

01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:21.834
So, you ever been
to one of these before?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.544
Yeah. It"s pretty fun.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:27.381
-What are you supposed to do?
-It"s easy. You just pick this up.

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:30.008
-Like this?
-Yeah. And then you hoId it out.

01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:33.220
-Got it!
-Now, just raise your pinkie, Iike this.

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:38.392
And then you say, ""Excuse me, miss,
but may I have a spot of tea?""

01:07:38.892 --> 01:07:42.312
Why, certainIy, Miss BeII.
A nice, fresh cup.

01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:45.858
Oh. But of course
you may have one, too.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:47.901
This is a tea party, after aII.

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.028
How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

01:07:50.195 --> 01:07:51.989
Why, of course, Doctor.

01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:54.575
-It"s my pIeasure, I"m sure.
-Thank you.

01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:58.579
-And wouId you Iike one Iump or two?
-Make mine three.

01:07:58.787 --> 01:08:00.664
(LAUGHS ) Oh, father!

01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:06.461
Thank you.

01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:12.301
-Isn"t this pIeasant, Father?
-I can"t imagine anything better.

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:15.137
AIthough, chiming the Big Ben
comes a cIose second.

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:18.223
-Oh, my goodness.
-Scrumptious.

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.569
Don"t even think about it.

01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:43.665
So, where were we?
Ah, yes.

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:48.587
""Fairies have many magicaI taIents.
They can taIk to animaIs,

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:53.383
""make the fIowers bIoom,
create warm summer breezes.""

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.095
Oh, Lizzy, what a beautifuI drawing.

01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:02.142
""And some invent
the most cIever IittIe gadgets.""

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:06.479
WeII, Tink,
you found something to fix after aII.

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.816
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:13.194
""They bring the change of seasons,
and heIp nature in many ways.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:19.618
""But the best taIent a fairy can have
is simpIy being a friend.""

01:09:21.078 --> 01:09:24.372
(SINGING )
The breezes blow the clouds away

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.667
A million things I want to say

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:32.130
I don"t ever want this day
To be done

01:09:32.506 --> 01:09:34.131
Summer"s just begun

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:36.801
Never seen the sky so blue

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:40.346
Everything is clear and new

01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:44.852
Happy just to be with you in the sun

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.435
Summer"s just begun

01:10:04.496 --> 01:10:07.249
(SINGING )
Hold my hand and fly

01:10:08.292 --> 01:10:11.086
Never say goodbye

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.257
Cross the open sky

01:10:16.175 --> 01:10:18.969
Leave the world behind

01:10:20.262 --> 01:10:23.348
I will be all right

01:10:23.974 --> 01:10:27.519
If you stay by my side

01:10:27.895 --> 01:10:31.732
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:35.611
We"ll live happy ever after

01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:40.532
We"ll fly higher
Than we thought we"d be

01:10:40.657 --> 01:10:43.744
Because you showed me

01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:46.413
How to believe

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:53.086
Hmm-mmm

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:56.465
Tiny shining star

01:10:57.674 --> 01:11:00.302
I know who you are

01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:04.515
You"re never very far

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.227
We"ll never be apart

01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:12.439
Sparkle in my eye

01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:16.902
Light the sky tonight

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.948
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.035
We"ll live happy ever after

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.498
We"ll fly higher
Than we thought we"d be

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.668
Because you showed me

01:11:32.793 --> 01:11:36.964
How to believe

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.969
In me

01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:08.120
Fall and winter
Love and laughter

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:11.957
We"ll live happy ever after

01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:17.004
We"ll fly higher
Than we thought we"d be

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:20.132
Because you showed me

01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:22.926
How to believe

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:24.803
Yeah

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:40.986
Hold my hand and fly

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:45.491
Never say goodbye
