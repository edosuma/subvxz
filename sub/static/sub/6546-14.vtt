WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.284
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.420 --> 00:04.126
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother.

00:05.965 --> 00:09.207
- I've turned Duke Crocker
into something awesome...

00:09.343 --> 00:13.507
A concentration of new Troubles
that no one has ever seen.

00:14.140 --> 00:17.098
- Do not touch anything else.

00:17.226 --> 00:21.060
- If my mom doesn't open a thinny
and let me leave, Duke will blow.

00:21.189 --> 00:25.057
- Do you think your vision was of a massacre
that happened here once?

00:25.193 --> 00:28.435
- "Croatoan"...
- That was carved today.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.811
- Julia!

00:29.947 --> 00:33.860
- Joe Sena, father who trapped cop Alex Sena
and Julia Sena, on that boat.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.405
- Joe, you're troubled,
and you are doing this to your kids.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.199
- Daddy!
- It's your Trouble that's trapping them.

00:39.624 --> 00:42.161
lt's trapping them in the places
you fear for them the most.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.876
- There are parts of her
that could make you better.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.791
Let me return them to you.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.379
- It's me.

00:53.095 --> 00:53.959
- Parker.

01:04.732 --> 01:05.767
- Duke!

01:08.486 --> 01:11.023
- Keep back. Those are all Troubles.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.323
- Duke, are you okay?

01:21.707 --> 01:22.867
- Can you help him?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.787
- I don't know.
Duke isn't like other troubled people.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.998
- All those Troubles... Where did they go?

01:29.298 --> 01:31.084
(indistinct chatter)

01:43.271 --> 01:44.260
- Ugh!

01:45.982 --> 01:46.812
- Ah!

01:46.941 --> 01:47.930
- Ugh!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.475
- Richard?
- What the hell was that?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.282
- Richard? What are you doing?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.610
(people screaming)

02:07.211 --> 02:09.202
- He's alive. He's just out cold.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.246
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know
Mara would go this far.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.544
(distant explosions)

02:15.386 --> 02:17.843
- We didn't know there were so many of them.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.258
- We've got to get back to the station, now.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.133
- Listen, you go, okay? Charlotte and I
will take Duke back to the hospital.

02:23.269 --> 02:24.679
- l'll grab my research.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.599
Whatever Mara's done to Duke,
we might need it.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.565
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.103
(distant explosion)
- Nathan...

02:32.236 --> 02:33.567
We have to split up.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.152
Listen to that.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.112
Haven is tearing itself apart.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.066
- You'll be okay?
- Yeah.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.328
- You trust her?

02:42.163 --> 02:45.906
- She chose me over her own daughter.
That's got to count for something, doesn't it?

02:46.042 --> 02:49.660
Besides, a little family time
could be enlightening.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.628
- Just steer clear from anything dangerous.
- Yeah.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.498
| just got you back.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.514
- Ready?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.386
(indistinct chatter)

03:10.232 --> 03:12.848
- Browne, Farkas. Head out to Marcoon Hills.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.897
Ward, Lenihan, you're on the flash flood
out at sixteen pools.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.816
- All Troubles?
- And all at the same time.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.076
This weird fog bank isn't helping.
We need to get in front of this.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.035
- What the hell is going on out there?
- Come here.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.082
- Mara's gone? For good?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.950
- It's just Audrey now.
But Mara got the last laugh.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.418
She messed with Duke,
turned him into some kind of bomb.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.754
All these Troubles came
bursting out, infected people.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.875
- So this fog around town...
it must be someone's Trouble.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.171
No one can get through it.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.590
- That fog has us trapped here?
- Yeah.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.679
Along with all these new Troubles
that Duke released.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.725
- Anyone in Haven could be troubled.

03:47.853 --> 03:48.842
And people are panicking.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.140
- And since Troubles are activated
by intense emotions...

03:51.273 --> 03:52.774
- This could snowball.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.769
- What?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.067
- This mightjust be the beginning.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.781
- What do you mean?

04:04.036 --> 04:07.995
- Well, back when l was dangling
in the void, l was injured.

04:08.124 --> 04:11.241
And ever since, I've been having these...

04:11.377 --> 04:13.584
visions.
- Visions of what?

04:13.712 --> 04:18.376
- A long, long time ago...
People running, screaming, dying.

04:18.509 --> 04:22.502
- And one word carved like
a desperate message.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.842
"Croatoan

04:26.600 --> 04:29.057
- The lost colony... in North Carolina.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.395
- We think... that something...
came out of the void

04:33.524 --> 04:35.185
through a thinny in North Carolina

04:35.317 --> 04:37.524
and wiped out all those people,

04:37.653 --> 04:39.484
erased them all from the face of the earth.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.399
- And what does this have to do with Haven?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.318
- That word, "croatoan",

04:43.451 --> 04:44.987
we found it again

04:45.119 --> 04:48.452
here, carved in a rock recently.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.075
We're afraid that it might be
some kind of warning,

04:51.208 --> 04:53.199
but whatever it is...

04:53.335 --> 04:56.623
it's here. And we're next.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.997
- Anything else... from your visions?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.044
Anything about what's going on now?

05:02.595 --> 05:05.382
- I'm sorry... no.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.674
- Could you have another one?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.014
- Maybe. Painkillers?

05:09.143 --> 05:11.680
Morphine at the hospital
brought on visions before.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.188
- That was totally unpredictable.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.477
Unless you guys have a bunch
of LSD lying around, |--

05:16.609 --> 05:18.850
- Figure it out. We need answers.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.198
(indistinct chatter)

05:24.700 --> 05:28.113
- Chief, a handful of officers
were dispatched to the edge of town

05:28.245 --> 05:29.451
to deal with this situation.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.536
- Do any of the officers
know about the Troubles?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.530
- No! Not many do.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.044
And it's falling apart out there.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.001
- Their fear could just make things worse.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.628
- This is chief Hendrickson.
Give me sit-rep.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.044
(officer): Chief, we ’re gonna have
a riot out here.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.917
- Calm down. Give me the facts.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.340
- All right, I don ’1' really
know how to, but...

05:47.473 --> 05:49.930
Okay, look, we got more
than a dozen citizens.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.176
No one can get through this fog.
They’re agitated, violent.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.928
Some of them are doing things,
he//, I can ’t even explain.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.601
- Listen to me very carefully.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.440
Do not scare those people...
No guns, no cuffs.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.730
Keep everyone calm.
That's your priority.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.603
- Sir, stop. Stop!
(man): Help me! Help me!

06:04.740 --> 06:06.071
- How are you doing that?
(long yell)

06:06.200 --> 06:07.986
Chief, we need backup now!

06:08.118 --> 06:10.279
(people screaming over walk/e)
- No! No!

06:10.412 --> 06:13.028
Ahhhh!
(static hisses)

06:17.086 --> 06:18.917
(explosion)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.377
- Come on, let's go!

06:23.968 --> 06:27.051
(theme music)

06:55.082 --> 06:56.538
(sirens wailing)

06:58.043 --> 06:59.954
- Hey, can we get some help?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.372
- What's going on?

07:01.505 --> 07:02.790
- We're evacuating everyone.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.130
There's some kind of deadly gas upstairs.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.171
The way it moves... I swear it had a face.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.299
- Okay, that sounds like a Trouble.
I need to go.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.217
- No, stay with Duke.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.261
I'll go. I'll help where I can
and grab my research.

07:15.728 --> 07:18.765
- Are you sure?
- Audrey, please, just...

07:18.897 --> 07:20.148
...let me do this.

07:20.899 --> 07:21.809
- Okay.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.273
- That was painfully heartwarming.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.646
- Oh, my God, Duke, are you okay?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.862
- Yeah.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.108
Yeah, I feel great, actually.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.612
- You had Troubles flying out of you.

07:36.749 --> 07:40.082
Do you feel empty now or normal?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.747
- Normal tends to steer clear of me.
What the hell is...

07:44.465 --> 07:45.750
Oh, my God.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.956
All of this...

07:49.720 --> 07:51.210
...is because of me.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.381
I wanted to stop it. I shouldn't
have even been here!

07:55.517 --> 07:57.303
- What are you saying?

07:57.436 --> 08:00.553
- l was gonna skip town,
go through a thinny into the void.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.099
- What? Why?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.689
- Far away from Dwight and Nathan and...

08:06.195 --> 08:07.435
you.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.482
- Oh...
- If I'd blown up in there,

08:10.491 --> 08:12.402
none of this would've happened.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.111
- Where are you going?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.783
- All of these Troubles,
they came from me.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.532
There must be something
in my familyjournal, right?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.830
We need to know what we're up against.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.046
- What the hell is this?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.047
- It's the last known location
of the patrolman

08:37.184 --> 08:39.516
that was on the radio
when the line went dead.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.974
- There were screams, shouting.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.722
Here it's so...

08:45.609 --> 08:47.190
...quiet.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.233
- What's wrong with these people?

09:01.291 --> 09:04.158
- It's another Trouble.
It's like they're frozen in place.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.473
They seem to be uninjured.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.974
- I think I found your patrolmen.

09:35.117 --> 09:38.655
- What the hell happened here?
- They were just following procedure.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.287
- That's part of the problem,
the guns, the cuffs, the Miranda rights.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.998
They scared these people
into activating their Troubles.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.914
We need a new approach
or Haven's gonna burn to the ground.

09:50.841 --> 09:51.830
- This...

09:52.426 --> 09:53.962
This fog...

09:56.472 --> 09:58.554
People can't get through.
They just get...

09:59.641 --> 10:01.256
...turned around.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.559
It just makes things worse.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.555
People always knew they could leave
if things got too bad.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.647
Now there's no escape.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.393
Scared people trying to run
realize they're trapped...

10:12.529 --> 10:14.485
- Freak out and activate their Troubles.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.822
- Which scares more people,
then more Troubles.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.863
- This keeps up, there won't be anyone left in
Haven. Where did this wall of fog come from?

10:20.996 --> 10:24.864
- There's only one person I know
whose Trouble could create a barrier like that.

10:27.044 --> 10:31.504
Parker, we got to find Joe Sena,
the guy whose Trouble locked up his kids.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.213
This fog that's trapping people in town,

10:33.342 --> 10:35.628
he could be behind it, right?
- Yeah, it makes sense.

10:35.761 --> 10:36.967
It sounds like his Trouble.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.383
I’ll go ﬁnd him, I’ll talk him down.
(car horn honking)

10:41.350 --> 10:42.681
(tires squealing)

10:43.644 --> 10:44.759
- Hang on.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.940
Whoa. Look out!

10:50.108 --> 10:50.733
Stop!

11:00.953 --> 11:02.284
Find him.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.028
We gotta bring this barrier down, now.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.079
(explosion, sirens wailing)

11:07.084 --> 11:09.040
(explosion, sirens wailing)

11:10.379 --> 11:11.994
(indistinct chatter)

11:13.549 --> 11:15.289
We sure about this?

11:15.425 --> 11:17.131
- Look at what we're up against...

11:17.261 --> 11:20.469
The fog, magnetic storms, explosions.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.555
On top of all of that, there's
reports of more officers frozen,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.094
down by the bakery and the wharf.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.187
- It's our only option.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.484
We've worked as hard as anyone
to protect Haven's secrets.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.770
But if we don't do this,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.488
there's not gonna be
anything left to protect.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.363
- All right, everybody,
drop what you're doing and listen up.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.200
Let's go, everybody. Come on.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.010
We need to tell you...

12:06.226 --> 12:07.966
People are dying out there.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.552
Some of you may know it already,

12:10.689 --> 12:16.309
but for those of you who don't,
you need to know why... the truth.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.738
- Haven...

12:21.867 --> 12:23.323
...it's, uh...

12:24.036 --> 12:25.901
It isn't like other places.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.909
In this town, there are people who have...

12:31.001 --> 12:32.741
...supernatural abilities.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.793
- People doing things you can't explain,
things that seem impossible.

12:41.178 --> 12:45.217
Some call these people cursed.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.839
We call ourselves troubled.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.840
(whispering)

12:50.812 --> 12:53.679
- He's not alone.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.066
l'm troubled too.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.725
People like us, we...

12:57.861 --> 13:00.819
...we've been in Haven for generations.

13:00.948 --> 13:04.440
- For those of you who already know about
the Troubles or had some suspicion,

13:04.576 --> 13:06.692
you need to know
this is the worst it's ever been.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.535
We won't survive like this.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.499
- What do you want us to do?

13:14.628 --> 13:17.495
- Adapt... as peace officers.

13:17.631 --> 13:21.123
People who are troubled...
they don't know what they're doing,

13:21.259 --> 13:23.341
even if they did, they probably
couldn't control it.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.303
Troubles feed off powerful emotions.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.298
- That's why it's so bad out there,
'cause people are scared.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.517
They're confused,
but they are not criminals.

13:32.646 --> 13:36.138
So, as cops, we can't treat them like it.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.435
- Forget what you know.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.856
Arresting them, drawing your sidearms,

13:41.989 --> 13:44.355
the protocols you rely on
as officers of the law,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.072
it's only gonna make things worse.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.117
We need to stay calm,

13:49.246 --> 13:51.032
make these people feel safe,

13:51.164 --> 13:52.904
maintain control.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.664
- You're looking pretty good
for someone who was just on death's door.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.754
- Yeah... yoga.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.512
All right, all right, all right.
Enough,enough,enough.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.178
Right now, look, I just...

14:17.274 --> 14:19.606
I want to focus on
cleaning up Mara's mess...

14:22.112 --> 14:23.443
My mess.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.109
I heard one of your
formerly uninformed cops

14:30.245 --> 14:32.611
talking about the girl
who can make things explode.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.113
I've seen that Trouble up close.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.911
I know the trigger.

14:37.044 --> 14:41.003
- Duke, there's a lot going on. I don't...
- Nathan, please!

14:43.008 --> 14:44.168
I need this.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.132
I gave her that Trouble.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.923
I saw when it happened.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.671
But this one...

14:51.808 --> 14:52.843
I can fix.

14:52.976 --> 14:57.345
So... unless you've got a cheat sheet
to solve some other Trouble...

14:57.481 --> 14:58.721
- No.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.391
Let's go.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.228
And today, we're bringing backup.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.318
- I know it's a lot,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.532
but it's the truth.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.867
I hate to ask, but...
anyone have any questions?

15:24.716 --> 15:25.831
- What?!

15:32.766 --> 15:34.882
- You're looking for a narcotic?
- Yeah.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.100
- Something to tap into your subconscious?

15:37.229 --> 15:41.438
- Honestly, we just need something
to activate one of my visions.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.025
- I've got just the thing.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.737
- Tequila?

15:52.869 --> 15:57.203
- Yep, it's so strong,
it's illegal even in Mexico.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.833
Oh, this'll give you visions, all right.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.450
- And you keep it in there with the bodies?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.122
- I don't hear them complaining.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.711
(sirens wailing)

16:05.799 --> 16:08.085
- lf Joe's not here, where else would he be?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.834
- His Trouble's based on protecting
his children, and his daughter's safe.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.587
Maybe he's out looking
for his son, Alex Sena.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.430
- The cop. Well, he should be easy
enough to track down, then.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.141
- Except for that he's missing.

16:18.270 --> 16:21.137
Nathan found his partner frozen
by a Trouble on Route 19.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.264
Maybe if we get back to town,
we can talk to some cops.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.936
- Audrey, even if we find Joe,

16:25.068 --> 16:27.684
how do we get him
to bring down the barrier?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.982
(explosion)
(gasp)

16:30.657 --> 16:33.364
And how do we talk him down from all this?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.278
- You're scared.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.153
- We're not immune to these new Troubles
that came out of Duke.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.904
Mara designed it that way.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.417
She was desperate
for a way to hurt our kind,

16:41.543 --> 16:43.875
and we... you could die.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.585
- Not just us, everyone.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.080
Kind of makes us like them, huh?

16:48.216 --> 16:50.502
So let's fix this.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.750
- Fine.

16:52.554 --> 16:53.964
But I'm driving.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.338
- Not happening.
(scoffs)

17:01.479 --> 17:03.515
- So inside, we got Lisa Hawkins.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.900
Anything she touches explodes.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.143
It's not her fault. She's not a perp,
she's a scared young woman.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.565
So we're gonna go in
in a small group, unarmed.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.780
Baucom, Cline, you're with me.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.776
Leave your weapons, maintain your distance.
Crocker's gonna do the talking.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.782
- Nice to see you all again,
you know, without the bars between us.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.827
- Remember, stay calm.
Keep her calm.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.215
The rest of you, watch the street,
keep pedestrians clear.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.956
Let's go.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.713
- Hey. lt's Alex, right?

17:37.849 --> 17:40.465
You're Joe Sena's son.
- Yes, sir.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.345
- Earlier today, you and your partner
responded to a call out on Route 19...

17:44.481 --> 17:46.062
...by the fog wall?

17:46.191 --> 17:49.183
- Yeah. Why?

17:49.319 --> 17:51.150
- Where else have you been today,
officer?

17:52.197 --> 17:53.812
- l, um...

17:53.949 --> 17:57.316
I've been running around town all day,
trying to help out where I could.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.943
But I couldn't do anything.
- No, | get it.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.995
Just tell me exactly where you've been.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.578
- L-like you said, uh...

18:05.710 --> 18:08.702
...out at the edge of town, the...
the bakery, uh...

18:08.838 --> 18:09.964
the... the fire at the wharf...

18:10.090 --> 18:12.376
- Oh, God. Alex...

18:12.509 --> 18:13.715
Are you...?

18:13.843 --> 18:16.004
- It's okay.
- Hang on, hang on.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.379
- Just stay calm. Alex, everything's okay.
- Get back.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.551
- Everyone, please.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.346
- He's one of them, isn't he?!
- No, no, no, no!

18:38.326 --> 18:39.532
Oh, my God...

18:51.464 --> 18:54.422
- What'd you do to them?
- Hang on.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.793
I didn't do this. You did.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.046
You said it yourself... you've been seeing
people get frozen all over town.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.219
Think about it, Alex,
you're the connection.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.318
- My partner and l...

19:12.444 --> 19:14.526
we responded to a call out on Route 19.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.155
There was... there was this fog.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.865
No one... no one could get out.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.657
Look, I had my training, but nothing could've
prepared me for what I saw today.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.579
- You were scared.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.997
When you're paralyzed by fear, you...

19:32.839 --> 19:34.625
freeze anyone who's around you.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.544
That's your Trouble.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.588
- My dad...

19:43.350 --> 19:46.467
...he called me. H-he was in a panic.
He was rambling.

19:46.603 --> 19:50.061
He told me that he put a barrier
around the entire town.

19:50.190 --> 19:54.274
I thought the old man had lost it,
but that's what that fog is, isn't it?

19:54.402 --> 19:57.189
He's got a Trouble too.
- Wait.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.690
Your dad caused the fog Trouble?

20:01.826 --> 20:05.068
That's not possible.
You guys couldn't have different Troubles.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.832
Unless you...

20:10.960 --> 20:13.918
...both got new Troubles today.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.210
- How... how is this even possible?
Why us?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.974
- Ah. Oh, I need a beer.
Tequila makes me thirsty.

20:28.103 --> 20:31.220
- That's it.
I'm done.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.473
- Hey, come on, we've come this far.
Drink up, lightweight.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.529
- Oh.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.826
(groaning)

20:54.671 --> 20:57.003
- Well, then... what now?

20:57.132 --> 20:58.338
- I don't know.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.376
The visions just happened
on their own before.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.507
Maybe we need to talk him into it.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.385
Uh, hello?

21:12.522 --> 21:13.728
Dave?

21:15.692 --> 21:18.934
Whatever you're connected to,
it's here...

21:19.654 --> 21:21.019
...in Haven...

21:22.490 --> 21:23.866
Now.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.485
(snonng)

21:28.621 --> 21:32.990
Damn it! You have to do this.
You're the key to all this nonsense.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.868
The void, the lost colony, croatoan.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.043
(heartbeat accelerating)

21:46.389 --> 21:48.050
lt's chasing someone.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.177
Hunting.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.550
I think I know the place.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.426
- Then we can still save them.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.181
- Not me. I can't...

21:57.317 --> 21:59.433
l'm hammered.
- Not for long.

21:59.569 --> 22:03.608
This will have you
stone-cold sober in no time.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.150
- What do you have that for?

22:05.283 --> 22:07.695
- Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.444
(sigh)

22:11.581 --> 22:12.787
(claps hands)

22:15.376 --> 22:16.536
- It's not working.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.660
- This isn't really my thing. My...

22:19.839 --> 22:22.876
My guess is that you're still scared.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.044
- Well, yeah.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.543
I'm a freak now,
trapped in a town full of them.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.136
You try taking your mind off of it.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.426
Wait.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.434
Why didn't I freeze you?

22:41.611 --> 22:43.602
- Because I did this to you.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.358
Your Trouble...

22:46.491 --> 22:48.277
Everybody who got a Trouble today...

22:50.703 --> 22:51.783
It all came from me.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.321
- You did this to me?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.994
To my dad?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.287
And now we're all stuck here
because of you?

23:01.464 --> 23:04.080
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

23:04.217 --> 23:05.423
- Shut up.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.839
You ruined my life...

23:08.972 --> 23:11.509
All of our lives, and you think
you can apologize for that?

23:12.433 --> 23:13.684
You know what?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.016
l was afraid.

23:16.479 --> 23:19.892
But the way things are now,
I can't afford to be,

23:20.024 --> 23:21.104
not anymore.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.775
You should get out of here
before you get more people killed.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.654
- Just...

23:35.790 --> 23:36.996
Take it easy.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.036
Come here. Come on.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.550
- What was that about?

23:49.679 --> 23:51.010
- I gave him his Trouble.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.801
- So that's why you didn't get frozen.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.054
You're immune to the Troubles
that come out of you.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.472
He'll be all right for a minute.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.567
Got to deal with exploding girl now,
but if she recognizes you...

24:07.447 --> 24:09.153
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

24:10.700 --> 24:14.067
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess I was...

24:14.203 --> 24:16.580
l was kind of thinking the same thing.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.797
- You guys ready?

24:39.896 --> 24:42.103
- I guess this means that we're walking.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.607
- Good thing I'm still in heels.

24:43.733 --> 24:48.193
- Nathan confirmed that Joe Sena is the one
creating the fog so we need to find him.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.529
- It feels like we're further from finding him
now than when we first started.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.740
- We just gotta keep trying, right?
It's what we got to do.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.733
- What if there's another option?

24:56.621 --> 24:59.784
The thinnies here, | sealed them
so that Mara couldn't use them.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.498
I'm the only one who can open them now.

25:02.627 --> 25:05.369
There's nothing more we can do here.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.838
What if we leave this place...
while we still can?

25:11.344 --> 25:12.174
- "Leave"?

25:14.764 --> 25:17.801
But you risked your life
going back for your research, I...

25:17.934 --> 25:19.265
...thought you said you could help us.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.726
- That's not what I went back for.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.140
I needed to get...

25:24.273 --> 25:25.433
this.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.893
We need these to go home.
They pull us through the void.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.565
Without them, we'd be lost there.

25:31.698 --> 25:36.863
You had Mara's for all this time,
but never really knew what it meant.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.703
Let's open a thinny, go through the void.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.697
You can even bring Nathan.

25:43.543 --> 25:46.034
And we'll return home

25:46.170 --> 25:47.831
as mother and daughter...

25:48.965 --> 25:50.921
To your real home.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.503
With your real family.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.215
- Charlotte, uh...

25:57.432 --> 25:58.547
...mom...

25:59.058 --> 26:00.639
I am home.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.390
I could never abandon Haven.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.686
These people need our help,
and we can help them.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.651
You were coming up with a cure
for the Troubles, weren't you?

26:11.779 --> 26:14.521
- See, that's just the thing.
Mara knew more about this than I do.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.864
I'm still learning.

26:18.703 --> 26:23.743
I don't know how to remove a Trouble
from someone without killing them.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.491
- That's not possible.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.668
You built the barn.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.038
It was Mara's prison. lt...

26:32.175 --> 26:34.917
It was gonna clean up
all of her mess, right? The...

26:36.095 --> 26:40.964
The barn was going to cure everyone's Troubles
ifl killed Nathan, the person that I love.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.512
That's how this was
all supposed to work, right?

26:43.644 --> 26:44.770
- No.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.555
If that happened, the barn
would've sent out a pulse.

26:49.817 --> 26:54.982
lt would've killed all troubled people...
everywhere.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.447
It wasn't gonna cure the Troubles.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.324
But it was going to end them.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.376
(sirens wailing)

27:13.716 --> 27:15.081
I know it sounds cruel, but--

27:15.218 --> 27:16.799
- How could you?
- Audrey...

27:16.928 --> 27:18.384
- You're no better than your daughter.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.219
- You are my daughter!
- Oh no.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.508
- No, we are family.
- No!

27:21.641 --> 27:24.633
I will never be like you.

27:26.395 --> 27:30.388
I'm gonna fix this on my own.
You go through your thinny, alone.

27:30.525 --> 27:31.310
- Audrey, please...

27:31.442 --> 27:33.228
- Get the hell out of my town.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.116
(indistinct chatter)

27:50.962 --> 27:52.543
- It's gonna be okay.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.789
You're not gonna hurt anyone else
if you do what we talked about, okay?

28:04.308 --> 28:05.263
- Parker.

28:05.393 --> 28:06.803
- Hi!

28:10.815 --> 28:12.771
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.475
What's going on here?

28:18.531 --> 28:20.067
I talked her down.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.987
Another squad's dealing with a guy
who causes earthquakes, and on and on.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.487
Dwight's got H.P.D. trying their best, but--
- Troubles keep popping up everywhere.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.579
- And the fog around town's
just making them worse.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.869
- Yeah.

28:31.002 --> 28:32.663
- Any luck finding Joe Sena yet?

28:32.795 --> 28:35.628
Alex doesn't know where he is either.
- What are we gonna do?

28:35.756 --> 28:37.257
What's the plan now?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.465
- l was gonna ask you the same thing.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.635
Where's Charlotte?

28:43.764 --> 28:45.504
Isn't there something she can do?

28:45.641 --> 28:48.132
- No. No, there isn't
anything she can do for us.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.930
(cell phone vibrating)

28:52.231 --> 28:53.311
Vince.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.099
Okay.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.224
We'll be right there.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.190
We got to go.

29:00.323 --> 29:01.779
Vince has got something.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.482
(indistinct chatter)
(telephone ringing)

29:07.788 --> 29:08.698
- Copy that.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.117
Head to Harper's Mills, now, now.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.660
Okay, they're on it.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.173
I'm busy.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.914
- I came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye.

29:22.345 --> 29:22.879
- Here...

29:23.012 --> 29:25.173
- If there's no cure for the Troubles in there,
I'm not interested.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.547
- It's my research... all of it.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.095
There's no cure, but I just...

29:30.227 --> 29:33.435
I wanted you to know that
I wasn't just wasting your time.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.643
- It wasn't my time you were wasting.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.767
Look around this town.

29:41.072 --> 29:42.187
(sighing)

29:49.538 --> 29:50.698
- We got a problem.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.618
The guys who were sent to Gilead Dam
to deal with the zero gravity?

29:53.751 --> 29:57.744
They need backup.
- We're running out of cops, Stan.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.337
- Chief, those are my friends out there,
I'll go.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.127
- Okay. You got this.
- All right.

30:04.053 --> 30:05.418
- This isn't working.

30:05.554 --> 30:08.045
- Move it. You're going in a cell.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.797
- Brandt, what the hell are you doing?

30:09.934 --> 30:12.596
- He's one of them, chief.
He makes things shake.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.138
- So you brought him here?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.523
- Yeah, we're gonna lock him up.
He was resisting arrest.

30:16.649 --> 30:17.684
(rumbling)

30:18.901 --> 30:19.890
(groaning)

30:20.820 --> 30:22.526
(screaming)

30:31.789 --> 30:34.075
- Guys...
What'd you find?

30:34.208 --> 30:36.073
- Dave's vision led us here...

30:37.294 --> 30:38.500
To him.

30:39.714 --> 30:40.829
He's dead.

30:47.430 --> 30:48.966
- lt's Joe Sena.

30:49.098 --> 30:52.056
His trouble was what created
this barrier around Haven.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.218
- The barrier's still up.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.220
- Dying doesn't always end the trouble.

30:58.357 --> 31:03.067
And who knows what all these new ones do?

31:03.195 --> 31:06.187
- What if the killer from your vision
knew that?

31:06.323 --> 31:09.690
In Dave's vision, the killer was chasing
this man, hunting him.

31:09.827 --> 31:14.321
What if he scared Joe into creating
this barrier around the town,

31:14.457 --> 31:15.742
then killed him?

31:15.875 --> 31:18.036
- So that no one could bring it down.

31:18.169 --> 31:21.502
- We're all trapped in Haven...

31:21.630 --> 31:23.461
with a killer.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.476
- Richard, you're tearing the building apart!

31:34.602 --> 31:35.557
Hey, hey!

31:35.686 --> 31:37.768
Look at me!

31:37.897 --> 31:38.636
Calm down.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.434
This isn't your fault, okay?

31:40.566 --> 31:41.976
We can stop this together.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.189
- Down on the ground!

31:44.737 --> 31:46.352
- No! Wait!

31:56.582 --> 31:58.288
(groaning)

32:04.298 --> 32:06.505
Stand down. Put your guns away now.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.129
McHugh...

32:10.262 --> 32:12.127
How'd you know that would work?
- Experience.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.131
Figured it's tough to get
worked up if you're out cold.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.723
- This mean you're back?

32:16.852 --> 32:19.104
- No offense, chief, it looks
like you could use my help.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.686
- Yeah.
(rumbling, electricity crackles)

32:23.025 --> 32:26.688
Okay, the building's unstable.
Everybody get out now! Now! Go!

32:26.821 --> 32:29.608
Go, get him out of here.
And thanks, McHugh.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.154
(cell phone ringing)

32:34.286 --> 32:35.116
Yeah?

32:35.246 --> 32:39.455
- Dwight, Joe Sena's dead,
but his barrier is still up.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.786
- So that's it.

32:42.628 --> 32:43.788
No way out.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.583
- We're screwed until we find another way
to get that barrier down

32:46.715 --> 32:48.251
or a cure for the Troubles.

32:48.384 --> 32:51.968
- There isn't one. It's time we started
to accept the way things really are.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.256
- What do you mean?

32:53.389 --> 32:55.095
- Telling our ofﬁcers wasn’t enough,

32:55.224 --> 32:58.466
but I know how we're gonna deal
with the Troubles from here on out...

32:59.311 --> 33:00.721
How we're gonna survive.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.145
- What's he gonna do?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.687
- I don't know. We gotta find a way
to get that barrier down.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.281
- Duke.
- He's immune to Troubles that came from him.

33:14.410 --> 33:18.028
- Maybe if we're lucky, he can figure out
a way to get the whole thing down somehow.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.450
- "Lucky"? What's that like?

33:23.169 --> 33:25.626
(siren blaring)

33:33.095 --> 33:36.132
(voice on loudspeaker): Attention,
citizens of Haven.

33:36.265 --> 33:40.304
Please stand by
for an important announcement.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.519
Attention, citizens of Haven.

33:43.647 --> 33:47.265
Please stand by
for an important announcement.

33:47.401 --> 33:50.768
Attention, citizens of Haven.

33:50.905 --> 33:54.489
Please stand by
for an important announcement.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.030
(feedback whines)

33:59.496 --> 34:02.488
- This is Dwight Hendrickson...
your chief of police.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.498
By now, you all know Haven as we knew it...

34:08.631 --> 34:09.837
...is gone.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.752
The Troubles are real.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.796
Anyone in Haven could have a Trouble.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.841
It’ll be something you wouldn’t want
or can ’t control.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.472
If you’re scared
and want to leave town,

34:20.601 --> 34:21.807
don't.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.055
There ’s a barrier around Haven.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.270
It’s like a shroud that blankets
the whole town.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.686
It looks like a fog,
but you can ’t get in or out.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.433
Help isn’t coming.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.151
We ’re on our own.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.980
But we have each other.

34:36.116 --> 34:39.404
We can help each other
live with what we are.

34:39.536 --> 34:43.404
There ’3 people in town who know
how to live with the Troubles.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.371
Have for years.

34:45.501 --> 34:48.243
You may know some of us.
We wear a tattoo.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.454
We call ourselves "The Guard."

34:51.799 --> 34:54.211
We've dedicated ourselves
to helping troubled people

34:54.343 --> 34:57.335
wherever and whenever we can,
and that's what we're gonna do.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.712
The old ways are gone.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.713
We won't survive like that.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.932
So The Guard's taking charge.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.889
The Guard will protect you.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.059
The Guard will maintain law and order.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.229
Stay safe.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.398
Stay calm.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.317
Your Trouble may never come out.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.700
Remember...

35:19.702 --> 35:21.533
You're not alone.

35:21.662 --> 35:24.278
We ’re all in this together.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.948
This is the new Haven.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.464
(cell phone dialing)

35:40.889 --> 35:43.926
- Duke, we need you.

35:52.443 --> 35:53.728
Thanks for meeting us here.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.277
- You guys really think I can just
walk through this thing, huh?

36:00.409 --> 36:01.524
(sighing)

36:01.660 --> 36:04.447
- It came out of a Trouble
that shot out of you.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.037
You're immune to them.
- And I'm not.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.702
Nobody else is.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.620
(groaning)

36:10.753 --> 36:12.334
- Even if I can, then what?

36:13.130 --> 36:14.119
Huh?

36:14.256 --> 36:15.962
Just click my heels, make it disappear?

36:16.091 --> 36:17.627
- It's worth a shot.

36:18.385 --> 36:21.092
Might be the first step towards
getting things back to normal.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.348
- Come on, Nathan.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.302
We all know there's no going back.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.514
I can't bring this shroud down.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.261
I can't save this town.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.185
I'm not the solution. I'm the problem.

36:35.903 --> 36:38.770
Haven will never be the same,

36:38.906 --> 36:40.646
and I'm the one to blame for it.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.067
On the other hand...

36:45.204 --> 36:46.694
iflhadleﬁ”.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.451
...none of this would be happening.

36:51.585 --> 36:54.292
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done a long time ago.

36:54.421 --> 36:58.539
- Duke... think of everything
that you've done for Haven.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.666
Think of all that you've done for us.

37:00.803 --> 37:02.634
- Oh, yeah, like what?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.634
Helping you kill troubled people?

37:07.893 --> 37:10.350
Sacrificing Jennifer to open that door?

37:12.856 --> 37:16.189
Everything that I do
in this town hurts someone.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.649
I'm not a hero.

37:19.238 --> 37:20.774
I'm just a smuggler.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.567
Haven, the Troubles.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.570
None of this was supposed to be my life.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.287
And the sooner I accept that...

37:30.416 --> 37:34.034
- Hey, don't do this, okay?
We need you. We can't do it without you.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.421
- I'm sorry, Audrey.
You're gonna have to.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.087
- Duke.
- Goodbye.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.837
- Duke!

38:09.455 --> 38:10.865
Nice speech.
- You think?

38:10.998 --> 38:13.910
I had to cut out the whole piece
about immigration reform.

38:15.169 --> 38:17.251
Listen, we got to get back to it, okay?

38:17.379 --> 38:18.744
Stamping out fires all over the place.

38:18.881 --> 38:21.748
- And how long do we expect this to last...

38:21.884 --> 38:23.920
the Guard in charge and all?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.303
- l was thinking permanently.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.841
- What about H.P.D.?
- What about it?

38:27.973 --> 38:32.057
The cops who didn't quit after today
alreadyjoined us.

38:32.186 --> 38:33.596
There is no more H.P.D.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.345
- So that's it, then.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.681
You're all Guard now.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.194
- You should be too.
You already got the ink.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.608
The Troubles are everywhere, and
The Guard's better equipped to handle it.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.115
- Is that an order, chief?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.404
- That's not me...

38:55.417 --> 38:56.918
Not anymore.

39:24.905 --> 39:27.487
- Did you finish the autopsy?
- Yes and no.

39:27.616 --> 39:31.985
Obviously Joe here is dead,
but there is no cause of death,

39:32.120 --> 39:35.362
and there is only one
other body like that found in Haven.

39:35.499 --> 39:36.784
- The Colorado Kid.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.373
- Yes.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.833
And there's this.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.163
(gasp)

39:47.302 --> 39:48.553
-Oh...

39:49.805 --> 39:51.796
The killer in my visions...

39:51.932 --> 39:55.891
...his victims... he pulled something
out through their eyes.

39:56.019 --> 40:02.185
Back in '83, I woke up on that beach
beside the Colorado Kid.

40:02.317 --> 40:07.812
I thought I killed him, but...
if this body is the same as his, then...

40:07.948 --> 40:10.781
- Then you didn't kill him
any more than you killed Joe Sena.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.401
You're just somehow
connected to whatever did.

40:23.463 --> 40:26.375
- So you need a new recruit, chief?

40:27.384 --> 40:29.750
- Gonna need to see your resume first.

40:39.021 --> 40:42.104
- You're still here.
- Not by choice.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.433
It turns out this shroud has blocked
every last way out of Haven...

40:48.280 --> 40:49.611
...even mine.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.276
- Great.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.659
One big, happy family.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.029
- Not really.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.704
- If you're stuck here...

41:03.503 --> 41:05.960
...maybe we can make it count for something.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.627
I know the barn wasn't a cure,
but I don't care.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.050
That was before you came here,

41:12.179 --> 41:14.591
and now, like it or not,

41:14.723 --> 41:16.588
we're in this together.

41:18.852 --> 41:20.717
- So what do you want from me?

41:20.854 --> 41:23.266
- Use your research.
Find another way.

41:23.398 --> 41:28.358
Build something that cures everybody
once and for all.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.818
- I don't know how.

41:29.946 --> 41:33.074
- But it is possible?

41:35.911 --> 41:36.900
- Maybe.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.408
- So when do we start?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.265
- Where you going, son?

42:06.608 --> 42:07.723
- Doesn't matter.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.601
- Well, I'm headed north, driving all night.
Hop on in if you want.

42:11.905 --> 42:14.237
(sighing)

42:14.366 --> 42:17.984
- You coming from Haven?
- Um...

42:20.122 --> 42:23.285
- Haven, it's the... the town right behind us,
you couldn't have missed it.

42:24.418 --> 42:29.629
- Buddy, I know Maine like the back of my hand.
I never heard of any Haven.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.042
- Yeah, trust me,
you're better off that way.
