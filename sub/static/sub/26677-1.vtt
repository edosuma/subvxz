Are you ready?

02:08.795 --> 02:09.795
- Yes.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.185
- Hi.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.919
- Hi. And what's your name?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.645
- Can you please
make it out to...

02:26.947 --> 02:29.459
It's so sad.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.695
It's like everyone can
see it, but her...

02:31.719 --> 02:34.255
but only when it's too late.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.703
- Hi. Annabel?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.915
Can you hear me?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.707
- Just. Where the hell are you?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.577
- The middle of bloody nowhere.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.424
I'm on my way to
teach a new course.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.292
- Christ. Don't give
anyone my details.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.360
I'm still getting emails

03:03.384 --> 03:04.961
from that last nutter
you sent my way.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.196
They're all psychopaths,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.498
and none of them can write
to save their lives.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.599
- I thought he had something.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.468
- Anyway, I had Derek
Payne on the phone,

03:11.492 --> 03:12.602
and he wants to confirm

03:12.626 --> 03:16.573
that you're ready for
next week's deadline.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.541
- Annabel, I...

03:17.565 --> 03:19.733
- Zandra, this is
the third time.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.511
- I know.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.315
- How much have you
got left to do?

03:25.339 --> 03:26.507
- I just...

03:27.375 --> 03:28.918
I just can't seem to find...

03:28.942 --> 03:29.986
- Christ, it's the au pair.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.321
I've gotta go.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.589
If he cancels the contract,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.348
you've only got
yourself to blame.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.427
- What is it with
your lot and books?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.860
- My lot?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.499
I'm sure we're all the same.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.634
- What's that?

03:54.502 --> 03:56.746
Something to say, have you?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.541
- What the hell?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.376
- Look what happens.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.444
- Well, don't blame me.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.913
You weren't watching
the bloody road.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.453
- I'm afraid, with
or without her,

05:09.477 --> 05:10.520
we shall have to begin.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.713
- Okay, right.
Everyone, let's start.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.024
- Uh, Steve's not here.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.726
- Can't wait for him either.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.750
Um, right.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.697
Uh, are you okay?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.166
- I'm sorry. I just don't like
being away from the kids.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.300
That's all.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.894
- Oh, don't worry.
You're amongst friends.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.304
W.G.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.674
- Thank you, Alisdair.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.633
And thank you all for
coming to Kilton Island.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.318
As you already will have seen,

05:42.342 --> 05:45.613
the island itself presents a
uniquely inspiring location.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.517
You, however, will be
marooned here by the tide

05:50.884 --> 05:53.954
that surrounds the island but
for a few hours each day.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.692
It is hoped that this and
other conditions here

05:59.927 --> 06:03.631
will create an atmosphere
of fertile isolation.

06:04.865 --> 06:09.470
To wit, one, you will
have no Internet access.

06:10.571 --> 06:14.575
Two, we receive no
mobile service.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.412
Three, there is a telephone
line in the office,

06:19.680 --> 06:21.915
but I insist it is only
used in cases of emergency.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.620
However, there is a telephone
by the rear stairs.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.266
I encourage you to
use this opportunity

06:30.290 --> 06:34.394
to look inside and
find the truth.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.074
That's ridiculous.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.836
- I must be off.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.048
Wishing you all a good night.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.583
- Let me get the door for you.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.942
- Well, thank you, young man.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.950
- Uh, that was W.G.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.362
- What a character.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.830
- That's one word for her.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.098
Well, okay,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.166
let's focus just a bit longer.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.068
Uh, I'm guessing it
feels pretty weird

07:05.092 --> 07:06.302
to be trapped on an island,

07:06.326 --> 07:08.672
about to bare your souls
to complete strangers.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.839
- I'm bricking it.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.733
- I have to say I'm...
I'm a bit scared, too.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.968
- Ah, it's entirely natural.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.181
This week's all about grappling

07:18.205 --> 07:19.840
with powerful,
unexpected emotions.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.052
Right. Um, let's get
to know each other.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.588
Um, you've got five minutes

07:24.612 --> 07:26.556
to interview another
member of the group

07:26.580 --> 07:29.449
before introducing them
to the rest of us.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.527
- Henry writes serial
killer thrillers.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.695
He says the genre isn't afraid

07:42.796 --> 07:45.465
to confront the dark
side of humanity.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.467
- Sounds really deep.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.604
This is Jo. She's
from Manchester,

07:51.639 --> 07:54.283
but we won't hold
that against her.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.878
- This is Daisy. Uh, she spends
most of her time traveling,

07:59.246 --> 08:03.483
getting ideas for her blog and
for her jewelry business.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.488
- Uh, this is Trië,
who's from Sweden,

08:09.389 --> 08:10.834
which is somewhere
I've never been to,

08:10.858 --> 08:13.794
but it sounds totally amazing,
and I would really love to go.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.509
- This is Rosy.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.145
Uh, she admits she
hasn't any experience,

08:22.169 --> 08:25.038
but she hopes she can be the next J.K.
Rowling.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.121
- This is Nigel. Nigel
used to be in the Army

08:32.145 --> 08:34.815
and served in the Falklands
before a career in recruitment.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.661
- The boot won't open.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.110
- This is Phil.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.838
Uh, Phil calls
himself a modernist.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.540
I've no idea what that is,

09:01.274 --> 09:03.811
but he seems like a clever chap.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.056
- Fucking coon.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.334
- What did you say?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.093
What did you say?

09:25.432 --> 09:29.002
- Think you're better than folk
just 'cause you read books?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.939
- Hey. Everything all right?

09:32.773 --> 09:35.776
- Yeah, and it's private.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.013
- Come on, mate. Leave out.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.491
I'm sure whatever it is,

09:42.515 --> 09:50.515
it don't really matter at the
end of the day, does it?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.631
- Thanks.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.599
- No worries.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.005
- I'm really looking
forward to it now.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.751
- I-I'd like to know

10:07.775 --> 10:09.919
what commitment we're
making to artistic quality.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.980
- We'll encourage you to take
yourself seriously as writers.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.885
- Exactly. I didn't come
here to indulge bad writing.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.063
Henry writes thrillers.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.430
What are we gonna
learn from clichés?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.000
- Sorry. That's
utterly pretentious.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.026
- Says the guy who
writes slasher porn.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.438
- Okay, that's... that's enough.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.506
We're all entitled
to our opinions,

10:30.530 --> 10:33.042
but we have to respect
one another's.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.836
Okay, that will do. See
you tomorrow at 9:30.

10:37.170 --> 10:41.208
And obviously Zed may hopefully
have turned up by then.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.020
- Uh, thanks.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.824
- No worries. I'm Steve.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.001
- Oh.

10:58.025 --> 10:58.802
- You doing the course, then?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.861
- Uh, sort of. I'm Zandra.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.294
- Zandra.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.273
Oh, Zandra.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.875
Fuck, yeah. I get it.

11:05.899 --> 11:06.943
- Shouldn't you be
with the others?

11:06.967 --> 11:09.737
- What? The meet and greet? Nah.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.048
I don't fancy it.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.075
Anyway, long as
you're all right.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.990
- Nice of you to turn up.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.883
- Christ.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.033
You almost scared
the life out of me.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.903
- Sorry. I didn't
mean to disturb you.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.194
- Oh, it's all right.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.798
You got me.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.198
I'm Jo.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.169
- Zandra.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.948
Please, don't let me interrupt.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.082
- Oh, no, you're all right.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.175
Be a bit weird reading
it with you there.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.278
I like it, though.
It's just it...

12:58.946 --> 13:00.423
It's so sad.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.025
- How do you mean?

13:02.049 --> 13:03.426
- I mean, I've only
just started it,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.028
but take the main character.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.220
It's like everyone
can see it, but her.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.898
- See what?

13:08.922 --> 13:11.935
- That she's gonna let
herself fall for Joseph,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.393
but only when it's too late.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.307
I've never thought
of it like that.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.675
- Oh, I'm not saying
it's obvious.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.311
I mean, she's interesting,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.914
because she can't see what's
right under her nose.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.940
- What about you?
What do you write?

13:27.607 --> 13:30.410
- Nothing. Well, one thing.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.291
My friend read it and made
me apply for a place.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.018
- Almost sounds like you
came here by accident.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.198
- Well, I'm surprised I got a place.
I applied so late.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.925
Still, I-I'm glad I'm here.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.064
- Well, good night, then.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.478
- Night.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.406
- Hello?

16:14.374 --> 16:15.618
Oh, my God! Ahh!

16:17.644 --> 16:18.687
- You all right?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.224
Ah, fuck.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.092
- How the hell did it get there?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.519
- Come on. Let's find a spade.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.022
I'll sort it for you.

16:46.873 --> 16:50.543
- I got up just
before 7:00 to write.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.788
Henry was already up.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.381
I figured he'd gone for a walk.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.585
- Well, his bag's still here
and most of his clothes,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.530
so he can't have left.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.022
- Okay, let's go
back to the others.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.904
- Alisdair, we have
to look for him.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.473
- No, we don't.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.308
You know what it's
like at these things.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.233
People get weird. Goes
with the territory.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.513
The lad's probably gone
for a whiskey or a wank.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.483
Either way, he'll be
back by dinnertime.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.175
- Alisdair, we're
looking for him.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.696
- You think something's
happened to him?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.355
- What, Prince Harry?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.166
Nah.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.659
Probably took one look at us
lot and threw in the towel.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.196
Can't say I blame him.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.572
You want a swig?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.375
- Yeah, go on.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.082
- Yes, that's right.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.618
Well, of course I understand.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.455
Thank you for your
time, Officer.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.361
I'm afraid they cannot commit
to any action for three days.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.129
- Three days?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.474
He could have drowned.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.542
- He could simply have strolled

18:19.566 --> 18:21.634
over the causeway
before the dawn tide.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.746
- Without his jacket?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.273
- Oh, jacket's incidental.

18:28.675 --> 18:32.279
It's simply a case of
first-night nerves.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.448
I'm sure you've seen
similar before.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
But what do we tell the others?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.998
- We simply tell them
the gentleman has left.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.633
That's all they need to know,

18:44.657 --> 18:46.735
your colleague included.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.661
I encourage you not
to scare the horses,

18:50.297 --> 18:53.333
not least when they've paid
so much to be stabled.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.369
If our guests should
leave under a cloud,

18:57.504 --> 19:00.416
I will be obliged to
refund their fees.

19:00.440 --> 19:05.178
This would make it
impossible to pay your own.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.122
- W.G. has called the police.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.259
They've said that there's
no reason to be alarmed.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.093
- But where has he gone?

19:11.117 --> 19:12.961
- We don't know, but I'm sure

19:12.985 --> 19:14.697
he will have reappeared
by lunchtime.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.098
Why don't we move on?

19:16.122 --> 19:20.293
- We're to jump straight in
with an exercise based on plot.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.472
We want you to write
about your character

19:23.496 --> 19:26.342
as they reach a pivotal moment
in their journey through life

19:26.366 --> 19:28.411
and confront the
world around them.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.678
- Tell the truth of that moment.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.414
If you're open to
the possibilities,

19:31.438 --> 19:32.948
you might be surprised
by what comes out.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.307
- You have 20 minutes.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.510
- Okay, if you could
stop writing.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.316
Steve, why don't you start?

20:18.618 --> 20:19.719
- Right.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.221
Okay.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.534
The Arsenal boy comes at him,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.460
so Danny smacks him
and puts him down.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.772
The quiz machine is smashed,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.607
and the glass crunches
under Danny's feet

20:31.631 --> 20:35.402
as he leans in and whispers,
"Do not fuck with the Yids."

20:38.137 --> 20:39.882
Danny stands up as
the pub kicks off.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.474
"Yiddos!" Danny screams.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.519
Then the pub door opens.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.521
Like a Western, in Cheryl walks.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.381
They look at each other knowing
they both want each other,

20:49.449 --> 20:51.451
and a month later,
they're married.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.563
- Okay.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.623
Uh, Alisdair, what
did you think?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.468
- I thought it was visceral,

20:59.492 --> 21:01.594
but, uh, we also
have to ask if...

21:02.729 --> 21:05.298
the work alienates the
audience too much.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.367
Uh, what about you, Rosy?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.269
- Uh, okay.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.918
As the sun shone,

21:15.942 --> 21:18.711
Tegan, Tia, and Tyler
Turtle were excited.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.857
Mommy was taking
them to the zoo.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.158
- Fuck's sake.

21:23.182 --> 21:26.529
- Tyler Turtle asked if they
had turtles at the zoo.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.521
"Yes," Mommy replied,
"so we better make sure

21:29.689 --> 21:31.824
we don't get mixed up
and trapped there."

21:32.959 --> 21:33.959
That's all I did.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.804
Is that all right?

21:35.828 --> 21:39.298
- Um, let's open it
up to the group.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.570
Anyone got something
to say, or...

21:46.172 --> 21:47.740
Z, what about you?

21:48.475 --> 21:49.642
- Okay. I'm, uh...

21:51.010 --> 21:54.447
not sure it's as pivotal a
moment as it could have been.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.584
Perhaps if it focused
on the moment

21:58.117 --> 21:59.819
one of the, uh...

22:00.887 --> 22:03.656
little turtles
actually came to harm.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.625
- That would be awful.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.460
- Terrible.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.439
- Um, moving on to Daisy.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.332
Um, Daisy, what have
you got for us?

22:15.101 --> 22:18.538
- Voluptuous ferns caressed her
as she pushed into the jungle.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.517
As animal mating cries pulsed,

22:21.541 --> 22:23.719
she remembered Oliver's
cruel rejection,

22:23.743 --> 22:25.778
which had inspired her
to go on this adventure.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.347
Sensual rhythms met her ears.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.093
She spied a clearing
in the distance

22:31.117 --> 22:34.554
where natives swelled in
a mad orgy of darkness.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.166
- That was amazing.
- Uh, yes, uh, very emotive,

22:38.190 --> 22:39.768
and there were a few
expositional lines,

22:39.792 --> 22:41.894
but sensual power
really carried it.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.673
- Thank you.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.798
- Trië.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.744
- I did not write.

22:48.768 --> 22:49.745
- Um, okay.

22:49.769 --> 22:50.769
Uh, Phil.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.807
- You're up.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.613
- This piece is called "Oeuvre."

23:02.281 --> 23:04.651
Aristotle, who lived
before the gun,

23:05.785 --> 23:08.588
plays Beckett at chess
in the midday sun.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.791
The furious Greek stormed
on with his queen.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.562
McGuffin, red herring,
stop being obscene.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.931
It's then that Samuel
grabs Chekhov's gun.

23:20.199 --> 23:24.437
"Bang," he says, and
the Greek is done.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.741
- A very challenging
passage, Phil.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.218
- You what?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.620
- I didn't understand
a word of that.

23:31.644 --> 23:35.014
- Well, I thought it was
impressive, high-stakes writing.

23:35.882 --> 23:36.882
Yeah, well done.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.895
- Um, okay, Nigel, you're up.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.096
- Yeah.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.955
- Right.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.536
This is an extract

23:47.560 --> 23:49.962
from my series of novels
about the Korean War.

23:50.963 --> 23:54.701
Now they emerged from the smoke,

23:55.334 --> 23:57.804
a line of KPA infantrymen.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.809
Spencer had already issued
the order to fix bayonets.

24:04.176 --> 24:08.715
His men now countercharged and
butchered their yellow enemy

24:09.849 --> 24:13.753
at close quarters
with bloodied steel.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.725
- Let's hear from the group.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.595
- I didn't understand
who was who.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.897
- I thought it was very violent.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.999
- Made me feel violent.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.702
- But did you like it?

24:30.870 --> 24:35.642
- Okay. Uh, I guess
i-it's time for lunch.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.021
Jo, we'll start
with you next time.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.047
- That's okay. I
didn't write much.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.379
- What do you mean I
can't come and stay?

25:04.403 --> 25:06.573
I am their mother.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.779
I've told you I've put
all that in the past.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.650
This afternoon, we
are digging deep

25:41.674 --> 25:43.576
into our characters'
inner feelings.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.947
- We want you to investigate the...
the conflicts

25:49.081 --> 25:51.794
and the fears that
rage in all of us.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.362
- And so in life, we
bury these feelings.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.823
- Yeah. What happens
if your character

25:57.890 --> 25:59.959
confesses the guilt
or the desire

26:01.160 --> 26:03.596
that they waste so much
time trying to hide?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.833
- Okay? You got 20 minutes.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.908
Trië, what about you?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.110
- I did not write.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.756
- Is anything the matter?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.091
It'd be nice to hear
something from you.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.984
- I will write
when I have words.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.187
I'm learning, and I'm grateful.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.791
- Okay. Jo, on to you.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.696
- Beth, it's me.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.974
Listen, I'm in the shit,

26:38.998 --> 26:41.133
so I'm leaving this message
to tell you the truth,

26:42.268 --> 26:45.004
which is I nick stuff,
always have done.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.916
Been having
counseling for years.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.609
That's where I go when I
say I've got dance group,

26:51.744 --> 26:54.747
except I've never been
to a dance group.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.049
I'm a klepto.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.028
I steal everything I can.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.198
It was me who nicked your
earrings when we were camping,

27:03.222 --> 27:06.025
and it was me who nicked
your bracelet last week.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.995
And the rest. Sorry.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.840
Now I've done something stupid,

27:11.864 --> 27:13.041
and I've got to disappear,

27:13.065 --> 27:16.111
but please call me if
you still want to talk.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.672
Shit, I just realized you
won't even get this message,

27:20.339 --> 27:21.841
'cause I nicked your phone.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.713
- It's mischievous,
and there's mystery,

27:27.413 --> 27:29.357
but perhaps it's too flippant.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.526
What's beneath the humor?

27:31.550 --> 27:34.186
That's the bit I'm
interested in.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.464
Okay.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.959
Steve, on to you.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.769
- "It's been hard.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.740
I haven't always been
the best of men,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.284
always fucking you off

27:56.308 --> 27:58.053
and going out drinking
with the lads.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.789
I'm sorry for calling
you a cripple,

28:00.813 --> 28:02.281
leaving you on your
own all the time.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.427
I wish I'd never met you,

28:05.451 --> 28:07.053
and I wish I'd
never married you.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.857
- I'm not against vernacular,
but you can take it too far.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.335
- But isn't that why we're here?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.694
- Sure, but, I mean, the
whole point about writing

28:16.829 --> 28:19.031
is that some sort of
alchemy takes place.

28:19.966 --> 28:20.943
- What the fuck does that mean?

28:20.967 --> 28:22.244
Why am I listening
to you, anyway?

28:22.268 --> 28:24.947
You're only here 'cause you
didn't flop enough books

28:24.971 --> 28:26.314
to pay for your next
fucking skiing holiday.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.350
- Steve, that's not fair.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.910
- That's it for this afternoon.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.113
Steve, I want a word.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.864
- Fuck!

30:31.297 --> 30:32.331
- So your writing...

30:33.132 --> 30:36.544
- I finished your book.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.404
- Oh. Right.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.873
And?

30:41.407 --> 30:43.109
- I don't get it.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.144
- What? The ending?

30:46.745 --> 30:49.115
- It was so clean.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.095
It's like everything seemed to
be building toward something,

30:53.119 --> 30:54.496
some kind of statement,
but it was like

30:54.520 --> 30:56.989
you were too afraid to
come out and say it.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.265
Found your dad's book.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.743
Sorry. I want some bigger world.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.045
- "The Book of Price."

31:10.069 --> 31:13.339
- I don't mean to sound rude,
but his book's boring.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.317
I read a few chapters.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.385
It's like listening to
someone who knows it all

31:17.409 --> 31:19.521
and never lets you
get a word in.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.181
And then there's you
writing these worthy books

31:23.349 --> 31:25.284
with your dad looking
over your shoulder.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.022
- Hardly. He's never
even read my work.

31:33.259 --> 31:38.030
- It's all so
serious, so proper.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.302
- Oh, I'm ever so sorry,

31:44.370 --> 31:46.172
but we thought you
might like to know

31:47.273 --> 31:49.317
the plan is to eat
our dinner earlier,

31:49.341 --> 31:51.686
and then we were thinking
of a trip to the pub

31:51.710 --> 31:53.112
before the tide comes in.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.215
- Yes.
- Oh. See you there.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.051
- Oh, is this it?

32:23.075 --> 32:24.075
- Oh, look.
- Yeah.

32:26.745 --> 32:27.990
- Really? That sounds good.

32:28.014 --> 32:31.193
- I'll see you in there.
I've just gotta make a...

32:31.217 --> 32:33.119
phone call.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.367
- Ah, good evening, sir.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.368
- What'll it be?

32:40.392 --> 32:41.769
- Right. What's
everybody having?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.338
My shout.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.340
- Where do you think
Prince Harry got to?

32:45.364 --> 32:47.075
- Henry?

32:47.099 --> 32:49.611
- Bit strange he just
ran off like that.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.138
- Phil said he left some of
his stuff in their room.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.781
I mean, how do we know

32:53.805 --> 32:56.084
that something hasn't
happened to him?

32:56.108 --> 32:58.086
- Yeah, Nigel's right.
He could have drowned,

32:58.110 --> 32:59.754
or he could be
stranded somewhere.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.124
- The police have been called.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.550
They will know the
correct procedure.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.991
- You, um, don't
remember me, do you?

33:14.126 --> 33:18.164
You wrote a report on
a manuscript of mine.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.135
- I did?
- Yeah.

33:24.670 --> 33:25.613
Years ago.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.216
It was called "On
Margate Sands."

33:28.240 --> 33:32.010
You said my work reveled
in arid intellectualism.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.789
- I'm sorry.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.416
Um, I only ever try to be...

33:38.584 --> 33:39.594
helpful.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.556
Well, it was very
painful indeed.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.405
But criticism makes
one a better writer.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.030
- Yes.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.531
Yes, it does.

33:57.536 --> 34:05.536
- Please excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

34:07.613 --> 34:15.612
- Please excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.136
Hello?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.108
Excuse me.

35:13.645 --> 35:17.392
- I'd happily learn
you some manners.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.451
- Will you get out of the way?

35:27.025 --> 35:28.427
- What's going on?

35:33.031 --> 35:41.031
Everyone's waiting
for you inside.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.612
- So, Nigel, you were
in the Falklands?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.415
- That's right. Three Para.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.517
- Did you do any fighting?

35:52.017 --> 35:53.285
- I did my duty.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.289
San Carlos, Longdon, Stanley,

35:57.956 --> 35:59.458
the whole shooting match.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.393
- Respect, Nige.

36:02.428 --> 36:05.264
- Oh, we were talking
about Henry.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.631
- And?

36:07.799 --> 36:10.678
- I mean, don't you think
we should do something?

36:10.702 --> 36:13.339
I mean, it's gone dark,
and he's still not back.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.384
- Look, if he's not back
by tomorrow morning,

36:16.408 --> 36:18.710
I'll call the police,
make them do something.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.688
- Time to drink up!

36:21.913 --> 36:26.428
- I promise.

36:26.452 --> 36:27.829
Tour of the island, Nige?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.721
- Not much further now.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.224
Nightcap, ladies?

36:32.724 --> 36:33.968
- No, thank you.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.036
- Come on.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.904
♪ The night is young ♪

36:40.332 --> 36:42.744
You all right?

36:42.768 --> 36:44.470
- Put your hand out.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.607
Hold still. You'll spill.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.251
Now...

36:59.818 --> 37:01.287
sorry about earlier.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.221
Wasn't fair.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.867
- It's okay.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.393
You weren't being malicious.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.229
- Shouldn't be telling
you what to do.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.831
It's not right.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.373
Needed that.

37:45.397 --> 37:51.946
Both of us.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.349
- What was that?

38:06.418 --> 38:10.064
- There's someone out there.
- Hey.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.590
- Who's there?

38:23.101 --> 38:24.736
- Oh, watch your step.
- Here we are.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.023
Henry!

41:38.296 --> 41:40.098
Henry!

43:24.870 --> 43:27.248
- These are my angels.

43:27.272 --> 43:30.141
This is Tegan, that's Tara,
and that's little Tyler.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.745
- It's like your turtles.

43:34.312 --> 43:35.957
- Yeah, that's right.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.883
I named the turtles after them.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.970
So what about you? Do
you have any children?

44:34.139 --> 44:35.673
- No, I do not.

44:37.142 --> 44:40.011
If you'll excuse me, I'm
going for my walk now.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.080
- So how many times you
read that book then, Phil?

45:17.448 --> 45:18.817
- I've lost count.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.752
- Ooh, must be good.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.821
Do you think I'd like it?

45:25.256 --> 45:26.533
- I don't think so.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.994
- Really? What's it about?

45:33.631 --> 45:35.409
- It's about a princely outsider

45:35.433 --> 45:39.237
who violently disdains
bourgeois societal norms.

45:41.106 --> 45:42.740
- Right.

45:44.109 --> 45:45.586
No, it doesn't sound very good.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.279
I think I might give it a miss.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.750
- I'm gonna go and
do some writing.

47:35.420 --> 47:36.597
- Phil.

47:36.621 --> 47:37.664
- Oh, hi, Jo.

47:37.688 --> 47:38.799
- Alisdair's looking for you.

47:38.823 --> 47:41.268
He said he wanted to
discuss your writing.

47:41.292 --> 47:43.161
- Uh...

47:43.761 --> 47:45.330
- He's down the wall.

47:51.402 --> 47:52.437
- I'll see what he wants.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.405
Thanks.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.394
- Christ.

48:07.418 --> 48:09.287
- What were you doing
in Phil's room?

48:09.687 --> 48:11.098
- Um...

48:11.122 --> 48:12.766
- What?
- I...

48:12.790 --> 48:16.161
- Look, I'll tell you later, I
promise, after the workshop.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.367
- I...

48:27.172 --> 48:28.172
- Jo?

48:32.043 --> 48:34.012
- Talk to you later.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.744
- Okay, people, uh, this
is our final session

48:57.768 --> 49:01.106
before Guy Glover arrives to,
uh, talk about publishing.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.043
- In the meantime, we're going
to do some more writing.

49:06.211 --> 49:08.289
- Last time, we wrote
about our characters

49:08.313 --> 49:10.557
confessing to hidden feelings.

49:10.581 --> 49:14.152
- Now we want you to show your
characters acting on them.

49:23.228 --> 49:26.564
- She suddenly felt
exposed, insecure, unsure.

49:28.199 --> 49:30.501
He rose and turned toward
her, handsome and suave.

49:31.569 --> 49:34.039
He passed, his breath
on her breast.

49:34.605 --> 49:35.605
She knew it was him.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.176
- On his return to the right,

49:39.310 --> 49:41.979
Spencer had become
lost in the command...

49:46.251 --> 49:48.519
- cold, Heaven, Hell.

49:49.620 --> 49:52.590
Terror harrowed her
little by little,

49:53.524 --> 49:55.993
below death caught,

49:56.594 --> 50:00.531
catch, catching, cut.

50:01.799 --> 50:06.137
- Okay. And lastly, Steve.

50:21.919 --> 50:23.897
- I drive like it's a dream,

50:23.921 --> 50:25.866
thoughts flying
this way and that,

50:25.890 --> 50:28.235
guilt, loathing, relief,

50:28.259 --> 50:30.804
each turning taking me
closer to that chair,

50:30.828 --> 50:32.773
the wheels on it
like a sick joke,

50:32.797 --> 50:35.176
cause it ain't
moving us nowhere.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.511
I think of her Mum being dead,

50:37.535 --> 50:40.071
her dad being dead, her
sister being a bitch.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.584
As for me, I think on
the room I just left,

50:43.608 --> 50:45.619
teenage hooker looking
at the ceiling

50:45.643 --> 50:47.312
while I drilled her...

50:48.579 --> 50:50.691
just looking, waiting
for it to be over.

50:50.715 --> 50:53.251
Then there's me, fucking all
that hate out of me into her,

50:54.452 --> 50:56.663
just shuffling into my
jeans, and walking out,

50:56.687 --> 50:59.324
after this, deciding
I won't be back.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.593
And both of us
knowing that I will.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.401
- I thought it was very moving.

51:10.835 --> 51:12.603
- Me, too.

51:15.273 --> 51:16.507
What about you?

51:17.275 --> 51:18.285
What did you think?

51:18.309 --> 51:19.686
- Um, I-I thought it was

51:19.710 --> 51:22.180
a very skillfully
invented slice of guilt.

51:24.782 --> 51:28.762
- What do you mean, invented?

51:28.786 --> 51:29.786
Yeah, you heard.

51:30.955 --> 51:33.224
You look down on me
'cause I'm rough?

51:35.993 --> 51:37.562
You lot play at the truth.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.533
Well, there it is.

51:43.268 --> 51:44.311
There's my truth.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.480
- Zandra.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.464
Z, you looked stressed.

52:03.488 --> 52:04.665
- It's okay.

52:04.689 --> 52:07.258
I just had the workshop from hell.
That's all.

52:07.792 --> 52:09.126
- Shall we go in?

52:11.262 --> 52:12.397
- Nice journey?

52:32.983 --> 52:35.753
- So what are you looking for?

52:36.554 --> 52:37.731
- Honesty.

52:37.755 --> 52:40.625
It doesn't matter if you
write vampire erotica,

52:41.626 --> 52:43.694
chick lit, or schizoid neolism.

52:44.795 --> 52:47.298
Do it honestly, and
we have a chance.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.467
Okay, who else has a question?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.436
- Yeah. Is it true

52:52.637 --> 52:54.748
publishers are less brave
than they used to be?

52:54.772 --> 52:56.049
- What do you mean by brave?

52:56.073 --> 52:57.742
- That you value money over art.

52:58.743 --> 53:00.554
- You're being naïve.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.180
Some books make money. Some don't.
It doesn't matter.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.493
I can balance one
against the other.

53:06.517 --> 53:10.255
Okay, let's continue this
discussion after dinner.

53:21.566 --> 53:23.801
- Daisy? May I have a second?

53:24.802 --> 53:27.605
I, um... I loved your story.

53:28.373 --> 53:30.207
I think that I, um...

53:31.075 --> 53:32.553
have something that
you should read.

53:32.577 --> 53:35.021
If you come back to my cabin...

53:35.045 --> 53:36.990
It's just I've got
this book that it...

53:37.014 --> 53:38.494
- Okay.
- Really reminds me of your...

53:39.584 --> 53:42.095
Michael... Please
leave a message.

53:42.119 --> 53:44.722
- I know you're there, Michael.

53:45.623 --> 53:47.468
Bet you stood next to the phone

53:47.492 --> 53:49.002
deciding whether to pick it up,

53:49.026 --> 53:50.971
but it don't matter,

53:50.995 --> 53:53.039
'cause you can't
ignore me anymore,

53:53.063 --> 53:54.875
'cause I'm coming back.
Do you hear me?

53:54.899 --> 53:56.777
I'm coming back to get my kids,

53:56.801 --> 53:59.304
and you will never
see them again.

54:05.376 --> 54:06.553
Cab service.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.789
- I need a taxi from
Kilton Island immediately.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.123
- We'll have to go now...

54:10.147 --> 54:11.525
- I don't care about that.

54:11.549 --> 54:13.518
- When can you be ready?
- Now!

54:45.015 --> 54:46.717
- Inspiring speech.

54:47.184 --> 54:49.286
- Who cares?

54:49.987 --> 54:51.756
They're all talentless idiots.

54:52.490 --> 54:54.659
- That's not fair.

54:57.928 --> 54:59.397
- I only came to see you.

55:01.832 --> 55:03.801
- Guy, that can't
ever happen again.

55:04.435 --> 55:05.703
- Why not?

55:08.606 --> 55:09.606
- Guy.

55:10.675 --> 55:11.685
Oh, Jo.

55:11.709 --> 55:12.709
Jo, wait!

55:58.155 --> 55:59.490
Rosy.

56:03.494 --> 56:04.629
- Henry?

56:05.162 --> 56:07.498
- Help me, please.

56:10.167 --> 56:11.368
- Henry?

56:13.037 --> 56:14.672
Henry?

56:18.576 --> 56:20.911
- Rosy, help me.

56:30.921 --> 56:31.956
- Henry?

56:38.929 --> 56:39.929
Henry?

56:46.003 --> 56:47.003
Henry?

56:52.910 --> 56:53.910
Henry?

57:29.880 --> 57:30.981
- Hey.

57:31.649 --> 57:32.950
- What is it?

57:56.106 --> 57:57.742
Alisdair.

58:22.099 --> 58:23.968
Zandra, is that you?

58:28.172 --> 58:36.172
Can I help?

58:38.248 --> 58:45.031
Can I help?

58:45.055 --> 58:48.559
- Jo! Jo, wait, please!

59:02.072 --> 59:03.674
Christ! Guy, that was...

59:32.469 --> 59:34.047
- Guy...
- What's happened?

59:34.071 --> 59:34.981
Are you hurt?

59:35.005 --> 59:36.316
- It's Guy, not...

59:37.441 --> 59:38.809
- No. No.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.246
- Where is Guy?

59:44.114 --> 59:45.716
- In the workshop room.

59:46.183 --> 59:47.652
He... Someone...

59:48.185 --> 59:49.730
He's been killed!

59:49.754 --> 59:51.856
- What's all the noise about?

59:52.723 --> 59:54.859
- She says Guy's been killed.

59:55.492 --> 59:56.703
- Wait.
- Fuck.

59:56.727 --> 59:58.739
- I left him. We just...

59:58.763 --> 01:00:01.031
When I came back, he
was just lying there.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:04.244
- We need to check this.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.979
- I'm not going out there.

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:07.738
- How do we know it wasn't you?

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.249
- What?

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.450
- Oh, you sick fuck!

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.418
I saw what's on your camera!

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.286
- What are you going on about?

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.121
- I saw what's on your camera!

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.489
- You went through
my private things.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:17.858
- Henry had been
missing for days.

01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:18.692
I looked around their room.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.761
- You thought I killed Henry?

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:21.862
You're a sick fucking bitch!

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:23.964
- I'm sick? He's got pictures

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:27.157
of car accidents on his
camera, dead fucking bodies!

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:28.935
- Is this true?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.737
- I don't have to
answer your fucking...

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:31.838
- Is this true?

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.864
- I don't have to
answer your fucking...

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.213
- We've got to find Jo.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:43.149
- Well, and the others,
Alisdair and Daisy, Nigel.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.151
- No, no, no, no. I'm not
going fucking anywhere.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.353
- You can stay here and die,
you little fucking nut.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.255
- Fuck off, you stupid ape!

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:51.024
TRIë: Stop it. No, no, no.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.917
- Are you two finished?
- TRIë: No.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.053
- We need to make
contact with the police

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:58.298
and get off the island.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.299
- We're not going anywhere.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.658
The tides are out for hours.

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:07.932
- We find the others, and
we get off the island.

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.125
- What the fuck was that?

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.908
Nothing.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:43.109
- Come on, then.
Call the police.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.133
- Let's go.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.982
Where's Phil?

01:02:22.006 --> 01:02:23.850
Phil.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.209
- Phil!
- Shh.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.013
- Phil, is that you?

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:54.280
Oh, God.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:55.615
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:57.041
- Oh, my God.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.775
- What's that?

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.344
What the fuck is that?

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.082
- It's Nigel's stick.

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.293
- It's covered in blood.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.785
- Oh, no.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.265
- What do we do now?

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.035
- Stay calm.

01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:16.002
- What do we do now?

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.004
What was that?

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.363
Damn.

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:26.312
- It was the bloody cat.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:27.804
Ohh.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.918
Christ.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:34.220
- Fuck! You scared the
fuckin' life out of me!

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.356
- What's going on? The
lights aren't working.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.216
- Thank God you're okay.
- Someone's killed Guy, Nigel.

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:41.962
- You're joking.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.287
- No, we're not.

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:48.192
- What's going on?
- It's true.

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:50.827
And now Phil's missing.

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:51.905
- Come on.

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:53.163
- We'll go this way.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.167
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:11.224
- So you found his body
in the workshop room?

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:12.950
- Yes, after...

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.961
I came to speak to you.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.254
- We cannot stay here.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.122
- Jo, wait!

01:04:42.146 --> 01:04:43.480
Oh, no. Ohh.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.482
No.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.493
Come on.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.486
- Jo, where are you?

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.925
Jo!

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.069
You all right?

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.383
- No.

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:37.454
No.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.157
- Be quiet.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.496
- Be quiet.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.130
- Wakey, wakey.

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:05.274
- I hope there's a moment
before the pain kicks in

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.379
when it's all blissfully calm.

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:22.559
- Hello, love.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:24.661
- Hello, Mother.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:41.511
- Make sure you tidy
up after yourself.

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:43.923
- Yes, Mother.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:05.735
- You poor sick fuck.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:07.880
- Careful, Steven.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:30.836
Do you know what threatens

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.363
to take the shine
off of all of this?

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.465
I liked you.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.302
- Yeah.

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.804
I've definitely gone off you.

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:47.119
Let the girls go.

01:10:47.143 --> 01:10:49.646
- Oh, Steven. You think
that all of this

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.318
is the action of
some random madness.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.762
Of course you do.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:59.499
Not one of you...

01:10:59.523 --> 01:11:01.534
- was capable of
seeing my truth,

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:04.260
my purpose, my power,

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:08.532
not even our humble teacher.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.872
Imagine the interest in
the survivor's story.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.477
The smoke from your
charred corpses

01:11:21.545 --> 01:11:25.382
will raise me up
to higher things.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:38.927
Steven...

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.833
do you see this?

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:45.669
- What the fuck?

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.340
- Oh, I like this one.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:04.954
- Fuck you.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.869
- Why, Steven, you seem to
have taken a bit of a knock.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:13.697
Let's put something
on that for you.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:36.786
Forgive me.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:40.356
- Oh, Steven, my dear, dear boy.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:42.492
Don't be so foolish.

01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:55.805
- I think we'll save you
for later, shall we?

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:57.573
- Let the girls go.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.549
- What about you?

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:08.785
- Not yet.

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:15.425
My time will come...

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.395
and when it does,

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.666
I will distract him.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.635
You must...

01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:28.971
Trië.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.742
She comes on a writing course,

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.411
but does no writing.

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:37.814
You coward.

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.749
- Mm.

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:29.966
- You okay?

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:45.815
- So why are you here?

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.487
- Use it to cut the rope.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:08.905
- I'm sorry.

01:15:14.778 --> 01:15:16.913
- You want to know? Okay.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.683
I will tell you.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.788
My daughter died two months ago.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:31.661
It was in an auto accident.

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:35.131
Her car caught fire.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.668
She burned to death.

01:15:40.804 --> 01:15:45.675
I thought there might be a
way for writing to heal me.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:47.944
Maybe I'd held...

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:52.616
the girl I'd protected and lost

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:56.686
reduced to dust.

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:08.932
- There's nothing
you can do to me.

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:10.934
I'm dead already,

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:16.873
and anything you do is
as harmless as rain.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.575
- I see.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:33.082
You sick coward.

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.725
- How's the pity now?

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:44.904
What's that?

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:47.997
Sorry. I can't hear you.

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:12.221
- "As harmless as
rain," you said?

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:15.018
- We've got to get
out of here now.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.328
Jo.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.364
Jo. Jo.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.069
Jo, we're gonna get out of here.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:32.194
- Which way?

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.830
- Just keep going!

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.294
- Stop! Stop.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.740
- Why?
- Here. Here.

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:10.542
- What?
- I've got to...

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:11.968
- Steve, no!

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:14.971
Come on, then!

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.061
- Come on, you spaz.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:07.659
Come on! Come on.

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:11.587
- No, I can't. I can't. My leg.

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:13.388
- Come on.

01:23:24.633 --> 01:23:25.577
- No, I can't!
- Come on.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.570
- I can't.

01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:30.139
- Come on.

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:35.111
- Oh, no. No.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:37.012
No.

01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:53.705
- That's right!

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:56.432
Poor, talentless imbecile
with a God complex

01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:59.135
kills defenseless girl.

01:24:00.203 --> 01:24:01.370
How many, Nigel?

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:03.282
How many has it been?

01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:05.341
How many third-rate novels?

01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:08.277
How many rejection letters?

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.313
How many wasted hours?

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:13.258
You're convinced
you're a genius,

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:14.893
just like every other poor sot

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.561
who thinks they got
a book in them,

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:19.664
but the truth is you're
a failure on the page,

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.525
and you're so stupid,
you can't even see it!

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.296
- As he crushed her
windpipe with his thumbs,

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:32.301
she realized the trap had been
set from the very beginning.

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:35.604
She was nothing more than bait,

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:40.609
a worm dying on a hook.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:52.321
- For the love of God,
won't you ever die?

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.447
No. No. No. No.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.583
No. No.

01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:30.795
Please, please!

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:33.456
Please, please, please.

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:36.325
No! No!

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.464
No.

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:03.486
Yes. Um, sorry.

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:05.964
