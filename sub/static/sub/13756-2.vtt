Do you have a girlfriend?

01:32.565 --> 01:34.965
Nasir (voice echoing): No. Do you?

Andrea: Would that turn you on?

65th Street driving a cab.</i>

02:32.725 --> 02:35.292
He was stone intox, like, crash-landed.

02:35.394 --> 02:37.861
- You didn't administer?
- Didn't get the chance.

02:37.963 --> 02:40.030
Call came in. We had to take him with us.

02:40.132 --> 02:41.732
Couldn't have him driving
off in that condition.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.867
I was running a check on
him when a call came in,

02:43.969 --> 02:46.036
so we put him in the car and responded.

02:46.138 --> 02:47.571
And then we found the girl.

02:47.673 --> 02:50.674
Apparently, you vomited,
up there in the crime scene.

02:50.776 --> 02:52.543
I was gagging, not puking.

02:52.645 --> 02:53.844
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

02:53.946 --> 02:55.145
No, no. I'm just saying, you know?

02:55.247 --> 02:56.713
I just wanna be really clear about that,

02:56.816 --> 02:59.183
'cause Bell's been going around
telling everybody I was puking.

02:59.285 --> 03:00.918
At any point when you
had him in your custody,

03:01.020 --> 03:02.719
did he say or do anything unusual?

03:02.822 --> 03:05.456
No. He was as quiet as a mouse.

03:11.097 --> 03:12.563
Let's go.

03:22.208 --> 03:23.740
(handcuffs clicking)

03:23.843 --> 03:25.809
All right. Let's go.

03:30.683 --> 03:32.516
Don't worry, Pauline. I'll be there.

03:32.618 --> 03:34.585
We'll settle up with the money after.

03:38.858 --> 03:40.491
You're asthmatic, huh?

03:40.593 --> 03:42.359
I used to have it when I was a kid.

03:42.461 --> 03:44.261
I know it when I hear it.
You might grow out of it.

03:44.363 --> 03:46.897
It's the same family as eczema,

03:46.999 --> 03:49.333
only that just keeps getting worse.

03:50.736 --> 03:52.736
But I'm not sure how it's gonna play.

03:52.838 --> 03:54.338
- What?
- The asthma.

03:55.241 --> 03:57.508
It might not be a bad thing.

03:57.610 --> 04:02.479
Well, then again, a knife-wielding,
heavy-breathing sex brute

04:02.581 --> 04:03.647
is not a pretty picture.

04:03.749 --> 04:04.982
- Sex brute?
- Mm.

04:05.084 --> 04:08.886
Okay. You need to understand
what happened here, all right?

04:08.988 --> 04:11.321
We were at her place, we
were drinking. I don't drink.

04:11.423 --> 04:12.689
And she started giving me all kinds...

04:12.791 --> 04:13.790
I wanna tell you something,

04:13.893 --> 04:15.225
and it's the most important thing

04:15.327 --> 04:17.027
you'll ever hear in your entire life,

04:17.129 --> 04:19.630
so don't not hear it.

04:19.732 --> 04:20.998
Shut it!

04:22.368 --> 04:24.201
They come up with their story,

04:24.303 --> 04:25.736
we come up with ours.

04:25.838 --> 04:28.338
The jury gets to decide
which they like best.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.806
Now, the good news is

04:29.909 --> 04:32.109
we get to hear what their story is first

04:32.211 --> 04:33.911
before we have to tell them ours.

04:34.013 --> 04:35.479
So we keep our mouths shut

04:35.581 --> 04:37.681
until we know what they're doing.

04:37.783 --> 04:39.550
You keep saying "story,"
like I'm making it up.

04:39.652 --> 04:41.151
I want to tell you the truth.

04:41.253 --> 04:44.288
You really, really don't. I don't
wanna be stuck with the truth.

04:44.390 --> 04:47.090
Not until I have to be.

04:48.561 --> 04:50.027
But you need to know what happened.

04:50.129 --> 04:51.595
I need...

04:52.865 --> 04:54.331
to be flexible.

17:12.237 --> 17:14.569
Eh, someone pass me a hankie.

17:14.673 --> 17:18.308
I'm sentencing you to 18 months in
the Franklin Correctional Facility.

17:18.410 --> 17:21.711
No, you will not be able to
work on your backhand there.

17:21.813 --> 17:24.314
Eighteen months? That's all he get?

17:24.415 --> 17:25.615
Gerwitz: I deserve it, Your Honor.

17:25.717 --> 17:27.916
Judge: You bet you do. Next.

17:34.192 --> 17:35.458
Talk to him.

17:38.063 --> 17:40.863
Hi. We'd like to see our son.

17:40.966 --> 17:42.465
His name is Nasir Khan.

17:42.567 --> 17:44.133
The Khan kid, how old is he?

17:45.337 --> 17:47.003
How should I know?

17:47.105 --> 17:48.304
Twenty-three.

17:48.406 --> 17:49.839
Can't do it then.

17:49.941 --> 17:50.807
Why?

17:50.909 --> 17:52.675
Five tokes over the line.

17:52.777 --> 17:54.644
(indistinct)

17:54.746 --> 17:56.846
Excuse me. What?

17:56.948 --> 17:58.948
He's an adult.

18:03.488 --> 18:04.954
We are not leaving.

18:05.857 --> 18:07.357
Free country.

18:14.432 --> 18:17.433
On the phone, you thought I was
calling to say she'd been arrested.

18:17.535 --> 18:18.968
She's been in trouble before?

18:19.070 --> 18:20.670
Mm-hmm.

18:20.772 --> 18:22.071
What kind?

18:23.041 --> 18:24.474
Drugs, mainly.

18:24.576 --> 18:25.675
Which?

18:26.678 --> 18:28.211
You name it.

18:28.313 --> 18:29.912
Forgive me for asking this.

18:30.015 --> 18:33.716
It's only because we're trying to
determine if she knew her attacker.

18:33.818 --> 18:35.752
Was she involved in prostitution?

18:35.854 --> 18:37.086
No.

18:39.024 --> 18:40.723
When I say no, I think no.

18:40.825 --> 18:42.091
You don't know for sure?

18:42.193 --> 18:44.527
There's a lot I don't know about her.

18:44.629 --> 18:46.929
Her mother and I weren't
married all that long.

18:47.032 --> 18:48.731
Where's her mother?

18:49.667 --> 18:51.934
She died last year, cancer.

18:52.037 --> 18:53.603
Sorry to hear.

18:53.705 --> 18:55.171
Her father?

18:55.273 --> 18:58.641
Died when Andrea was like... 10.

18:58.743 --> 19:01.344
He was quite a bit older than Evelyn...

19:01.446 --> 19:02.578

19:03.481 --> 19:04.881

19:04.983 --> 19:06.149
Not for a while.

19:06.251 --> 19:07.316
Job?

19:07.419 --> 19:09.752
Job? No.

19:09.854 --> 19:10.787
Boyfriend?

19:10.889 --> 19:11.888
Lots of those.

19:11.990 --> 19:14.757
She ever mention the name Nasir Khan?

19:14.859 --> 19:16.225
Goes by Naz.

19:16.327 --> 19:18.361
Is that who did it?

19:18.463 --> 19:20.496
- He's a suspect.
- In custody?

19:20.598 --> 19:22.265
We're talking to him. Do you know him?

19:23.701 --> 19:25.201
Naz?

19:26.271 --> 19:27.837
No. Did she know him?

19:27.939 --> 19:29.739
She may have just met him.

19:29.841 --> 19:31.407
I'd like to show you some pictures.

19:31.509 --> 19:32.909
I don't want to see those.

19:33.011 --> 19:34.644
Not of her, of him.

19:35.513 --> 19:37.647
In case you've seen him around.

19:42.754 --> 19:43.886
He's an Arab?

19:43.988 --> 19:44.821
No.

19:44.923 --> 19:47.623
- He's not an Arab?
- No.

19:49.127 --> 19:51.027
What are they?

19:51.129 --> 19:53.229
Any of them look familiar?

19:57.502 --> 19:58.568
No.

19:59.604 --> 20:01.737
The house will be sealed for a while.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.506
You got some place you can stay?

20:03.608 --> 20:05.041
I don't live there.

20:05.143 --> 20:07.844
It's Andrea's house, her mother's.

20:08.746 --> 20:10.780
I live in Queens.

Canada, no frets about humidity.

- Three years?

20:23.461 --> 20:25.962
How come I can't get time like the Jew guy?

20:27.765 --> 20:29.232
You want Jew time?

Do a Jew crime.

- Yeah.
- Yes.

26:52.817 --> 26:53.749
Of course.

26:53.851 --> 26:56.018
But he didn't do this.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.853
Of course he didn't.

26:59.423 --> 27:00.489
I...

27:01.726 --> 27:03.092

27:05.997 --> 27:09.031

said until it shows up in court.

27:26.317 --> 27:27.416
I... I said I didn't do it.

27:27.518 --> 27:29.885

the truth can hurt me.

27:29.987 --> 27:32.354

27:32.456 --> 27:35.858
Okay, Naz, you're the jury.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.160
Run the truth by yourself.

27:38.262 --> 27:40.129
Who killed this girl?

27:40.231 --> 27:41.430
Someone else?

27:41.532 --> 27:43.799
Or the guy with blood on him,
his fingerprints on everything,

27:43.901 --> 27:45.868
and the murder weapon in his pocket?

27:47.505 --> 27:49.638
The truth can go to hell

27:49.740 --> 27:53.075
because it doesn't help you.

27:53.177 --> 27:57.846
And if you can't get that
through your head, right now,

27:57.949 --> 28:00.215
you can forget about the rest of your life.

28:06.591 --> 28:07.890

- He didn't do it.

28:17.568 --> 28:19.168
- Do what?
- Exactly.

28:19.270 --> 28:22.304
You call the DA yet?
You're gonna have to soon.

28:22.406 --> 28:24.239
And I will.

28:24.342 --> 28:26.208
Well, this is a... This is a lock?

28:26.310 --> 28:28.544

28:28.646 --> 28:30.145

28:56.173 --> 28:57.473
(chuckles) Hey.

28:57.575 --> 29:01.110
How'd it work out with that
IAD investigation, Lucas?

29:02.079 --> 29:03.879
You still carrying a gun?

29:03.981 --> 29:06.148
Anybody say you could drink our coffee?

29:06.250 --> 29:07.916
Is that what this is?

29:08.019 --> 29:09.752
Hey, how's it going with that Arab kid?

29:09.854 --> 29:12.254
You sure he's lowlife enough for you?

29:12.356 --> 29:14.323
You know, Raymond, someday
when you got the time,

29:14.425 --> 29:19.495
I'd love you to teach me that choke
hold you used on the Ortega kid.

29:19.597 --> 29:21.830
Raymond: I can show you now if you want.

29:21.932 --> 29:23.732
We can go outside.

29:29.273 --> 29:32.875
(snoring)

29:37.782 --> 29:39.648
Box: Your parents are nice people.

29:40.518 --> 29:41.750
I'm gonna try and expedite,

29:41.852 --> 29:44.653
get that cab back to your
father as soon as possible.

29:45.623 --> 29:47.556
I know how important that is.

29:47.658 --> 29:49.258
We're both working men.

29:51.462 --> 29:54.029
Your lawyer tell you not
to talk to me anymore?

29:55.399 --> 29:57.032
Not even casually?

30:02.106 --> 30:04.006
He ask you how it happened?

30:05.710 --> 30:06.909
He didn't?

30:07.778 --> 30:09.078
It doesn't surprise me.

30:10.448 --> 30:12.614
Makes no difference to him,

30:12.717 --> 30:13.782
or to his job.

30:13.884 --> 30:17.286
And you are a job to
him, Naz, make no mistake.

30:17.388 --> 30:19.588
He's gonna make money off this,

30:19.690 --> 30:21.657
your parents' money.

30:21.759 --> 30:23.659
The longer it takes, the more he makes.

30:23.761 --> 30:25.728
They can't afford that, can they?

30:27.498 --> 30:29.164
You know where he is right now?

30:29.266 --> 30:33.368
Downstairs drinking coffee with the
detectives, breaking each others' balls.

30:34.705 --> 30:35.938
Because the fact is,

30:36.040 --> 30:38.774
it's a big club, the
criminal justice system.

30:38.876 --> 30:42.111
We can't exist without
each other, and we know it.

30:42.213 --> 30:43.579
But I'm not a member of that club.

30:43.681 --> 30:45.781
I don't like the idea of a double life.

30:45.883 --> 30:47.649
My job is to get to the truth.

30:47.752 --> 30:49.685
So I don't see why I should socialize

30:49.787 --> 30:52.788
with anyone trying to
stop me from doing that.

30:52.890 --> 30:55.057
That's why I'm up here with you...

30:56.560 --> 30:58.994
instead of drinking
coffee down there with him.

31:00.197 --> 31:01.563
You shouldn't be doing this, should you?

31:01.665 --> 31:03.766
- What?
- Talking to me without him here.

31:05.569 --> 31:07.569
You know, I really love what I do, Naz.

31:08.539 --> 31:11.473
But every once in a
while, I get frustrated.

31:11.575 --> 31:13.475
I abide by the rules, though, I do.

31:13.577 --> 31:15.144
So, yeah,

31:15.246 --> 31:18.113
that's right. You don't
have to talk to me...

31:18.215 --> 31:19.815
unless you want to.

31:23.420 --> 31:25.320
You know...

31:25.422 --> 31:28.657
this is the most
open-and-shut case I have had

31:28.759 --> 31:30.859
in a very long time.

31:30.961 --> 31:33.962
Everything is pointing to you.

31:34.064 --> 31:36.031
But there's something I'm just not getting.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.934
Something I am struggling
with here because...

31:39.036 --> 31:44.072
what I see before me is a nice kid
from a good, hardworking family,

31:44.175 --> 31:46.175
loving mother and father...

31:47.478 --> 31:50.813
on what has got to be
the worst day of his life.

32:15.039 --> 32:16.138
Thank you.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.372
You're welcome.

32:21.212 --> 32:22.778
What am I not seeing, Nasir?

32:22.880 --> 32:24.079
(inhaler hisses)

32:25.549 --> 32:28.383
Explain to me what I'm not understanding.

32:29.687 --> 32:31.820
It looks like I killed her, I know that.

32:31.922 --> 32:33.822
Yeah, that's how it looks.

32:35.159 --> 32:37.059
But it's not that simple, is it?

32:39.096 --> 32:41.029
Because we both know this isn't you.

32:41.131 --> 32:42.798
You didn't get out of bed yesterday

32:42.900 --> 32:45.634
saying to yourself, "I'm
gonna murder someone tonight."

32:45.736 --> 32:48.637
What you were thinking was "I
hope I pass the economics test.

32:48.739 --> 32:52.407
I hope my mother gets off my
back for this, that, the other."

32:52.509 --> 32:54.343
And things just got out of hand.

32:54.445 --> 32:55.944
Sex, drugs, alcohol.

32:56.046 --> 32:58.480
Some girl. You didn't mean
to do it, things happen.

32:58.582 --> 32:59.581
Please stop.

32:59.683 --> 33:02.985
If I'm off, tell me how I'm off.

33:03.087 --> 33:06.188
Help me, help you, Naz. We'll
never get another chance.

33:16.200 --> 33:20.035
You know, there's something
any experienced detective knows,

33:20.137 --> 33:22.771
and it's something I've personally
witnessed hundreds of times

33:22.873 --> 33:24.940
in the last 30 years.

33:26.210 --> 33:29.878
Christian, Jew, Muslim, what have you.

33:29.980 --> 33:31.947
There's an immense sense of relief

33:32.049 --> 33:35.450
when they finally just let
go and tell someone the truth.

33:37.154 --> 33:39.254
It's like...

33:39.356 --> 33:40.956
finding God.

33:56.907 --> 33:59.574
I'm not talking to you anymore.

Now, put these on.

35:04.842 --> 35:06.842
Stone: Just remember,
don't talk to anybody.

35:06.944 --> 35:09.344
These people, these men and
women, this is their life.

35:09.446 --> 35:11.046
This is what they do every single day.

35:11.148 --> 35:13.949
You're at a massive disadvantage here.

put it in the donation

40:17.571 --> 40:19.537
You keep it, it's a new offense.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.473
Is this okay?

40:26.246 --> 40:27.679
You're good. Go.

40:28.749 --> 40:31.583
Come on. Hands up, spread your legs.

40:31.685 --> 40:32.951
All right, turn around.

So this is my place, and I like it neat.

No.

No.

47:01.641 --> 47:03.841
The cab's a guilty picture postcard.

47:04.811 --> 47:06.511
Check this guy out.

47:09.249 --> 47:11.916
Box: This would be Ali,
the first Imam of Islam.

47:12.018 --> 47:13.951
Yeah? Where's he now?

47:14.054 --> 47:14.952
Nowhere.

47:15.055 --> 47:17.855
He was assassinated in the 7th century.

47:17.957 --> 47:20.425
The Shias see him as the
rightful heir of Muhammad,

47:20.527 --> 47:22.727
the Sunnis don't, and therein lies the...

47:22.829 --> 47:24.495
you know?

47:24.597 --> 47:26.597
What were you, Box, in counter-terrorism?

47:26.699 --> 47:28.566
I like to read.

47:28.668 --> 47:30.101
Yeah, but that shit?

47:30.203 --> 47:33.356
_

47:39.412 --> 47:41.045
Do you see "arraignment"?

48:07.841 --> 48:09.240
(knocking on door)

48:14.114 --> 48:16.380
Mr. Khan, how are you?

48:16.483 --> 48:17.748
I'm going crazy.

48:17.851 --> 48:20.318
I understand. I'm a father myself.

48:20.420 --> 48:21.686
And I'm sorry to intrude.

48:21.788 --> 48:25.523
This is a court order allowing
us to search the house.

48:25.625 --> 48:26.657
For what?

48:26.759 --> 48:28.126
May we come in?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.779
(door opens)

48:52.485 --> 48:54.886
Mrs. Khan, nice to see you.

48:54.988 --> 48:56.354
Sorry to disturb.

49:04.364 --> 49:07.832
(floorboards creaking)

49:07.934 --> 49:09.734
(chandelier glass rattling)

49:12.038 --> 49:14.305
What were you doing up there?

49:14.407 --> 49:15.473
Laundry.

49:33.793 --> 49:36.093
We're going to have to take that one, too.

49:36.196 --> 49:37.728
That one is not Nasir's.

49:37.830 --> 49:39.096
That... That one is Nasir's.

49:39.199 --> 49:40.698
This is ours. We need it.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.600
We need them all, sorry.

49:54.681 --> 49:56.080
Rodriguez.

49:57.083 --> 49:59.116
(cell door opens)

50:06.292 --> 50:08.859
Stone: Mr. Khan, this is John.

50:08.962 --> 50:11.229
Your son's attorney.

50:11.331 --> 50:13.531
His arraignment's gonna be at
the next session later today.

50:13.633 --> 50:16.367
100 Center Street, Court
2 on the ground floor.

50:16.469 --> 50:18.903
Hang on a second.

50:19.005 --> 50:21.072
Or you can have it in trade.

50:21.174 --> 50:24.008
Let me tell you something
about me, Pauline.

50:24.110 --> 50:25.977
I have the strength of ten.

50:26.079 --> 50:27.211
You know why?

50:27.313 --> 50:29.814
Because my heart is pure.

50:29.916 --> 50:31.282
Yeah, just not your feet.

50:31.384 --> 50:32.550
I know a remedy for that.

50:32.652 --> 50:33.884
I've heard them all before.

50:34.787 --> 50:36.120
- Thank you.
- Any time.

50:36.222 --> 50:37.321
Good luck to you.

50:39.058 --> 50:40.258
You still there?

50:41.194 --> 50:43.494
Because they can.

50:43.596 --> 50:45.997
Well, you just have to get a new computer.

50:46.099 --> 50:47.365
Just hang on a second.

50:47.467 --> 50:49.233
What is it, your remedy?

50:49.335 --> 50:50.735
A machete.

50:50.837 --> 50:53.938
(chuckles) This fucking guy over here.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.306
Yeah.

50:56.643 --> 50:58.009
Box: Prints put them in the cab.

50:58.111 --> 51:00.011
Parking ticket puts the cab at the scene.

51:00.113 --> 51:04.081
Prints, witnesses, and his own
statements put him in the scene.

51:04.183 --> 51:06.017
Harry's got the blade
to within half an inch,

51:06.119 --> 51:08.519
the same as the knife in
his jacket pocket, bloodied.

51:08.621 --> 51:09.920
And all this without a phone call.

51:10.023 --> 51:11.489
I called. Hence, I'm here.

51:11.591 --> 51:13.224
Today. Not the night of.

51:13.326 --> 51:17.028
I didn't want some kid two years out
of John Jay fucking up my crime scene.

51:17.130 --> 51:19.664
I'll be happy to lead
throughout. May we proceed?

51:19.766 --> 51:20.765
Of course.

51:20.867 --> 51:21.899
What's he like?

51:22.001 --> 51:24.402
College kid, no record,
but hey, it's murder.

51:24.504 --> 51:27.204
You don't have to have
done it before to do it.

51:27.307 --> 51:28.472
What else?

51:28.574 --> 51:29.907
For what it's worth, he's Muslim.

51:30.009 --> 51:32.009
Nation of Islam or...

51:32.111 --> 51:34.879
Real one. As in, from Queens. Pakistani.

51:38.351 --> 51:40.051
I wanna wait on the blood.

51:40.153 --> 51:43.120
I want a house in Montauk. Come on, Helen.

51:43.222 --> 51:44.555
You sure he did it?

51:45.658 --> 51:46.857
No question.

51:46.959 --> 51:48.125
You blinked.

51:48.227 --> 51:50.161
I did not blink.

51:50.263 --> 51:52.063
Dennis, honey, you did.

51:52.165 --> 51:54.365
I've been up 56 hours.

51:56.569 --> 51:58.302
So how am I gonna lose it?

51:59.305 --> 52:00.371
You're not.

52:04.677 --> 52:07.178
Woman: If I call your name, line up.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.379
Jackson.

52:09.482 --> 52:11.048
Ortiz, F.

52:12.318 --> 52:14.051
Ortiz, W.

52:15.054 --> 52:16.087
Khan.

52:17.490 --> 52:18.856
Hightower.

52:19.892 --> 52:21.559
Cruz.

52:21.661 --> 52:23.060
Williams.

52:27.266 --> 52:29.233
Bail set at 500.

52:29.335 --> 52:31.402
That's a 100 an 8-ball. Sound fair?

52:31.504 --> 52:35.473
Jimmy, next time, tell your client
to leave his tomahawk at home.

52:35.575 --> 52:37.341
Where'd you have to go for this one?

52:37.443 --> 52:39.076
Paris.

52:39.178 --> 52:40.611
You're kidding me.

52:40.713 --> 52:42.346
Toccoa fucking Georgia.

52:44.384 --> 52:46.016
(indistinct conversation)

52:46.119 --> 52:47.918
Judge: Next.

52:48.020 --> 52:51.722
43562, Nasir Khan.

52:51.824 --> 52:53.190
Which one of you is him?

52:54.527 --> 52:55.793
Mm-hmm.

53:02.268 --> 53:03.968
(scanner beeps)

53:11.811 --> 53:13.077
Hey.

53:13.179 --> 53:15.613
You waived the reading of the
rights, but not the rights themselves.

53:15.715 --> 53:17.715
Ah. So waived.

53:21.687 --> 53:22.887
You're Mr. Khan?

53:22.989 --> 53:24.054
Yes, sir.

53:24.857 --> 53:26.223
Well, according to the complaint,

53:26.325 --> 53:28.592
you're charged with possession of a weapon,

53:28.694 --> 53:30.761
possession of a weapon for deadly purpose,

53:30.863 --> 53:32.396
resisting arrest,

53:32.498 --> 53:34.298
aggravated sexual assault,

53:34.400 --> 53:37.034
and murder in the first degree.

53:37.136 --> 53:38.068
Fuck me.

53:38.171 --> 53:39.403
How do you plead?

53:40.640 --> 53:42.206
I didn't do it.

53:42.308 --> 53:45.476
Mr. Khan, this court is
kind of like "Jeopardy."

53:45.578 --> 53:46.944
I ask a question,

53:47.046 --> 53:49.313
the answer has to be in the right phrasing.

53:49.415 --> 53:52.516
He means to say "not guilty," Your Honor.

53:52.618 --> 53:54.552
Is that what you mean to say, Mr. Khan?

53:54.654 --> 53:56.120
Yes.

53:57.323 --> 53:58.489
Can you say it?

53:59.492 --> 54:00.624
Not guilty.

54:00.726 --> 54:02.159
Thank you.

54:02.261 --> 54:04.061
Your Honor, if we can be heard on bail.

54:04.163 --> 54:06.697
The defendant has extensive
family roots in Pakistan,

54:06.799 --> 54:09.967
and given the fact he's charged with
murder based on overwhelming evidence,

54:10.069 --> 54:11.735
and facing a sentence of life,

54:11.838 --> 54:14.939
we consider him a serious
flight risk and request remand.

54:15.041 --> 54:16.040
John?

54:16.142 --> 54:19.176
Your Honor, my client
was born in this country.

54:19.278 --> 54:21.879
Whatever so-called
roots he has in Pakistan,

54:21.981 --> 54:25.082
he's got far deeper roots in
his community here in Queens.

54:25.184 --> 54:27.318
In fact, he's never been to Pakistan

54:27.420 --> 54:29.720
or anywhere else outside
New York State in his life.

54:29.822 --> 54:32.990
He's a young man from a
solid working-class family.

54:33.092 --> 54:34.892
A college student, no priors.

54:34.994 --> 54:38.529
He's not a danger to himself
or others, and is, in fact,

54:38.631 --> 54:41.599
desperate to prove his
innocence in a courtroom,

54:41.701 --> 54:43.934
and so not a flight risk.

54:44.036 --> 54:47.171
And despite the DA's
confidence in the evidence,

54:47.273 --> 54:49.139
there are no witnesses to the actual crime.

54:49.242 --> 54:52.510
Which is to say, the evidence
against him is purely circumstantial.

54:52.612 --> 54:54.378
It's not purely circumstantial, Your Honor,

54:54.480 --> 54:56.847
All of which is to say, we request a bail

54:56.949 --> 54:59.283
commensurate with his
family's ability to raise it.

54:59.385 --> 55:01.852
Your Honor, this was a
particularly vicious crime.

55:01.954 --> 55:04.688
CJA, Your Honor, recommends ROR.

55:04.790 --> 55:06.390
I don't care what CJA says.

55:06.492 --> 55:09.126
It's a waste of taxpayer's money, honestly.

55:09.228 --> 55:13.297
Now you both know I usually like
to split the baby in terms of bail,

55:13.399 --> 55:17.768
but I'm going with Mr. McPherson on this
one due to the severity of the charges.

55:17.870 --> 55:20.671
That's all they are, Your
Honor, charges. Not facts.

55:20.773 --> 55:23.507
You can take it up at a later
date if the circumstances change,

55:23.609 --> 55:25.409
but I'm denying bail.

55:25.511 --> 55:28.679
Your client's hereby
remanded to await prosecution.

55:30.149 --> 55:31.215
Don't talk to anybody.

55:31.317 --> 55:32.850
Where am I going?

55:32.952 --> 55:34.285
John.

55:34.387 --> 55:38.556
Just curious. Friend of the
family, or right place, right time?

55:38.658 --> 55:40.224
Right place, right time.

55:40.326 --> 55:41.892
Right place, right time. Good for you.

55:42.929 --> 55:44.495
Yeah.

55:44.597 --> 55:45.629
Next.

55:46.632 --> 55:50.367
Bailiff: 43563, Hightower.

55:50.469 --> 55:52.937
That's what I expected, okay?

55:53.039 --> 55:54.939
Judge: Mr. Hightower, we meet again.
