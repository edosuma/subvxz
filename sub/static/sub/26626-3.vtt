you were in the Gruber house?

43:41.619 --> 43:43.204
I don't know.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.789
Two, maybe three weeks ago.

43:44.831 --> 43:47.167
Three weeks is a long time

43:47.208 --> 43:49.377
without seeing your son.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.047
His name is Josef.

43:52.088 --> 43:54.591
And I need to see him.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.801
It must've upset you
that Viktoria

43:56.843 --> 43:58.511
wouldn't let you see
your own child.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.139
Or perhaps Herr Gruber

44:01.181 --> 44:03.266
forbade you from the house.

44:03.308 --> 44:06.186
Perhaps both.

44:06.227 --> 44:07.896
You think I did this?

44:07.937 --> 44:10.523
I didn't say that.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.567
Well, I would never...

44:12.609 --> 44:14.778
never...

44:16.738 --> 44:18.573
I need to see my boy.

44:18.615 --> 44:20.533
Come.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.097
(Lorenz exhales)

44:55.985 --> 44:58.780
You think he's going to confess?

44:58.822 --> 45:00.740
His son is the best...

45:00.782 --> 45:04.452
-really only defense for him.
-(scoffs)

45:04.494 --> 45:06.496
What kind of killer
comes back to a murder scene

45:06.538 --> 45:08.164
with police present?

45:08.206 --> 45:11.084
Many of them.

45:11.126 --> 45:13.503
-They love the attention.
-(sighs)

45:13.545 --> 45:15.588
Fine, then...
what kind of killer

45:15.630 --> 45:17.841
spends a weekend
in the same house

45:17.882 --> 45:21.177
after killing an entire family?
Especially if he lives nearby?

45:21.219 --> 45:23.096
Did you see his reaction

45:23.138 --> 45:25.974
when he went into
Viktoria's room?

45:29.436 --> 45:31.938
You've lost your mind.

45:31.980 --> 45:35.775
So, after Karl died,
Lorenz saw a chance

45:35.817 --> 45:37.485
to be with Viktoria.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.279
But her father,
Andreas, said no.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.822
Sued him, even.

45:40.864 --> 45:42.657
For child support.
They wanted Schlittenbauer

45:42.699 --> 45:43.825
to pay for the boy.

45:43.867 --> 45:47.579
Incest. Lawsuits.
The abuse.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.080
If he was still alive,

45:49.122 --> 45:51.666
I'd probably
kill the old man myself.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.793
And Lorenz would have known
the house better

45:53.835 --> 45:55.170
than anyone not living here.

45:55.211 --> 45:58.089
Now you see.
Good.

45:58.131 --> 46:00.258
He knew
where all the bodies were.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.344
Moved them around
while searching.

46:03.386 --> 46:05.263
Moved the evidence.

46:05.305 --> 46:08.099
-But why stay?
-After years of being shunned,

46:08.141 --> 46:11.769
he finally had everything
he wanted under one roof.

46:11.811 --> 46:15.773
A fantasy.
A break with reality.

46:52.435 --> 46:55.271
Maybe there was evidence
in the hay,

46:55.313 --> 46:57.190

let the prime suspect

46:57.232 --> 46:59.734
clean the crime scene,

leaving us with nothing

Schlittenbauer, Karl Gabriel,
Frau Rieger,

including myself,

47:22.298 --> 47:24.759
now that I know him.

47:24.801 --> 47:27.470
Now anyone who passed
by the house is fair game.

The mailman,
the neighbors,

47:28.972 --> 47:31.516
all the villagers.

47:31.558 --> 47:34.602
So, what are our chances
to solve this?

47:34.644 --> 47:37.397
Without a confession?

47:37.438 --> 47:41.276
Without a... loose tongue
after a night of drinking?

47:41.317 --> 47:44.320
Without guilt
overtaking a killer...

47:44.362 --> 47:47.490
who could sit calmly
