00:28.236 --> 00:30.062
<i>Life is a story.</i>

00:30.971 --> 00:33.062
<i>People think dreams are stories.</i>

00:34.142 --> 00:36.743
<i>They seem like stories, but they're not.</i>

00:40.348 --> 00:43.437
<i>Misguided, no shape, no form.</i>

00:43.517 --> 00:45.339
<i>No reason.</i>

00:45.819 --> 00:50.248
<i>Like rummaging through unmarked boxes
in a long-forgotten storage shed.</i>

00:55.096 --> 00:57.001
<i>You'll think it was a story...</i>

00:57.893 --> 01:01.809
<i>...but try telling a friend of yours
what happened in your dream the next day.</i>

01:03.571 --> 01:06.399
<i>Only then will you finally realize...</i>

01:06.479 --> 01:08.339
<i>"...wait a minute...</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:11.133
<i>...that wasn't a story at all."</i>

01:12.813 --> 01:15.102
<i>Not all my dreams were like this.</i>

01:16.250 --> 01:18.341
<i>Some of them really were stories.</i>

01:20.321 --> 01:22.322
<i>Some of them were like this.</i>

01:29.463 --> 01:31.933
<i>Mom takes me to an amusement park.</i>

01:34.602 --> 01:36.450
<i>It's deserted...</i>

01:36.530 --> 01:38.026
<i>...dusty...</i>

01:38.106 --> 01:39.555
<i>...lifeless.</i>

01:39.635 --> 01:43.805
<i>Even the barkers pitching unwinnable
games for kewpie doll prizes do so...</i>

01:43.885 --> 01:46.936
<i>...with all the</i> joie de vivre
<i>of a cancer patient.</i>

01:47.898 --> 01:49.794
<i>But I'm ecstatic.</i>

01:50.184 --> 01:52.673
<i>No crowds means no lines.</i>

01:59.193 --> 02:05.021
<i>And there it is, the snowcapped summit
in the topography of juvenile taste.</i>

02:05.949 --> 02:08.414
<i>The wonderful haunted house ride.</i>

02:09.803 --> 02:12.693
<i>Its façade promised more
than papier mâché monsters...</i>

02:12.773 --> 02:15.296
<i>...wrapped in derelict-resistant
chicken wire.</i>

02:18.279 --> 02:22.390
Mom, we gotta go. We gotta go
on the haunted house ride.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.138
Are you sure?

02:24.218 --> 02:28.059
It says right on the marquee,
it's the scariest one in the world.

02:28.139 --> 02:32.623
Of course, I'm sure.
We have to, have to, have to.

02:58.302 --> 03:00.362
Are you sure you wanna go?

03:01.235 --> 03:03.700
The sign ain't lyin'.

03:04.926 --> 03:06.814
I'm ready.

03:06.894 --> 03:09.104
Are you sure you're ready?

03:16.654 --> 03:21.280
<i>And the car lurched forward clumsily
and crashed through the doors...</i>

03:22.310 --> 03:24.170
<i>...which snapped back.</i>

03:27.215 --> 03:29.238
<i>And into the darkness.</i>

03:33.887 --> 03:35.717
<i>Into the darkness.</i>

03:39.543 --> 03:42.223
<i>Whisking along through the darkness...</i>

03:48.469 --> 03:50.312
<i>...and crash...</i>

03:51.342 --> 03:53.649
<i>...out the other side.</i>

03:54.608 --> 03:58.986
<i>No pneumatic hiss pop ups,
no shrill startle bells...</i>

03:59.066 --> 04:00.901
<i>...nothing...</i>

04:00.981 --> 04:03.481
<i>...not even the faintest attempt.</i>

04:06.387 --> 04:08.213
<i>A con game.</i>

04:12.393 --> 04:16.262
What a rip-off. We should get our money back.

04:19.536 --> 04:20.910
Mom...

04:20.990 --> 04:24.475
...we got ripped off
by the idiots who live here.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.012
You're not gonna do anything about this?

04:28.282 --> 04:29.764
Mom?

04:30.444 --> 04:32.833
We should get our money back.

04:32.913 --> 04:36.137
<i>She turned to me very slowly and said...</i>

04:37.417 --> 04:40.242
"What makes you think the ride's over?

04:41.372 --> 04:44.628
What makes you think it's ever gonna end?"

04:46.394 --> 04:49.683
<i>That was the first
of these experiences I had.</i>

04:49.763 --> 04:52.987
<i>I'm still reluctant to call them dreams.</i>

04:53.067 --> 04:55.656
<i>I had that one when I was four.</i>

04:56.406 --> 04:59.216
<i>Let me show you the one I had last night.</i>

05:00.141 --> 05:01.996
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

05:02.576 --> 05:04.398
<i>It's this house.</i>

05:04.478 --> 05:07.938
<i>I hate this house. It won't let me sleep.</i>

05:09.317 --> 05:12.473
<i>Oh, my God, I am asleep...</i>

05:12.553 --> 05:15.743
<i>...and dreaming about being
right here in my bedroom...</i>

05:15.823 --> 05:18.240
<i>...trying to fall asleep.</i>

05:19.927 --> 05:21.782
<i>I had to open my eyes, but I couldn't.</i>

05:21.862 --> 05:27.321
<i>I could only open the little dream eyes
inside my head, because I felt the fear.</i>

05:27.401 --> 05:31.893
<i>I felt the dread, pending,
closing, all around me.</i>

05:32.473 --> 05:35.613
<i>Only one kind of dream tries to hide itself.</i>

05:38.245 --> 05:40.334
<i>The door is open.</i>

05:41.614 --> 05:43.244
<i>He's already here.</i>

05:52.493 --> 05:55.283
<i>You can't run in a nightmare...</i>

05:55.363 --> 05:58.402
<i>...not with atrophied muscles
over tungsten bones...</i>

05:58.482 --> 06:00.889
<i>...not through the gelatinous atmosphere...</i>

06:01.419 --> 06:03.279
<i>...not from him.</i>

06:56.290 --> 06:59.947
<i>I watched my hand draw a row
of faces on my whiteboard...</i>

07:00.027 --> 07:04.152
<i>...and despite the childish artwork,
I could instantly recognize each...</i>

07:04.232 --> 07:07.062
<i>...family, friends.</i>

07:10.703 --> 07:14.573
<i>I left the room, then blackness.</i>

07:20.130 --> 07:24.772
<i>The next time my senses returned to me,
I was not before my whiteboard.</i>

07:24.852 --> 07:29.577
<i>I was in a basement,
standing before a mirror...</i>

07:29.657 --> 07:33.421
<i>...surrounded by the </i> mise-en-scène <i>
of nightmares.</i>

07:34.161 --> 07:37.782
<i>I was in his world now, not my own.</i>

07:48.109 --> 07:51.165
<i>And I can't wake up.</i>

07:51.945 --> 07:53.835
<i>I can't wake up.</i>

07:54.715 --> 07:58.639
<i>Oh, my God, I am awake.</i>

07:58.719 --> 08:02.611
<i>Awake in the very location
where my nightmare ended.</i>

08:03.191 --> 08:05.046
<i>This was real.</i>

08:05.226 --> 08:09.712
<i>How much nightmare would prove
to be real? Did I sleepwalk here?</i>

08:10.364 --> 08:14.256
<i>How could I have pulled
so sadistic a trick on myself?</i>

08:15.836 --> 08:19.696
<i>Especially as I didn't know where "here" was.</i>

08:38.258 --> 08:40.548
<i>I know this place.</i>

08:42.763 --> 08:44.795
<i>This is my home.</i>

08:47.235 --> 08:50.855
<i>I was just in a room
that doesn't exist in my own house.</i>

08:55.075 --> 08:57.164
<i>First, relief...</i>

08:57.244 --> 08:59.683
<i>...then a sobering realization.</i>

09:01.014 --> 09:06.481
<i>As I had fallen asleep where my dream
began and woke up where it ended...</i>

09:06.861 --> 09:10.590
<i>...I could never know for sure
what was a dream...</i>

09:11.224 --> 09:13.270
<i>...and what wasn't.</i>

09:15.828 --> 09:19.687
<i>Here I am now, in a much warmer place...</i>

09:20.267 --> 09:22.289
<i>...in a much brighter place...</i>

09:22.369 --> 09:25.827
<i>...enjoying a picnic
with my brother and his girlfriend.</i>

09:26.807 --> 09:30.231
<i>You're gonna have to get used
to the way I speak out loud...</i>

09:31.111 --> 09:35.168
<i>...my inner voice is considerably
more sophisticated.</i>

09:35.248 --> 09:39.107
John, this chicken was good,
but we didn't bring any ice cream.

09:42.255 --> 09:45.728
I'm sorry I didn't bring any ice cream
on a picnic, Dennis, but, uh...

09:45.808 --> 09:47.605
...well, we have cupcakes.

09:47.685 --> 09:51.284
No, I don't want cupcakes.
All I want is ice cream.

09:51.364 --> 09:54.755
- We have ice cream at home.
- Well, I like the kind at the store.

09:54.835 --> 09:57.925
- We have that kind at home.
- Well, it's better at the store.

09:58.005 --> 10:00.294
It's exactly the same.

10:00.774 --> 10:04.131
You just wanna see that girl.
What is her name?

10:04.211 --> 10:07.317
Susan, I think. Yeah, she's cute.

10:07.397 --> 10:11.339
I think someone has a crush.

10:11.419 --> 10:15.376
No way, all I want is ice cream.

10:15.456 --> 10:18.105
I don't know any girl.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.029
What girl?

10:20.693 --> 10:23.223
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

10:24.932 --> 10:27.488
It's nice to see you.

10:27.568 --> 10:31.374
Of course, it's nice to see me.
I'm outlandishly hot.

10:33.006 --> 10:35.562
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough?

10:35.642 --> 10:38.165
You know my flavor.

10:38.245 --> 10:40.765
Of course I do, you're my favorite customer.

10:44.718 --> 10:46.374
I got ya.

10:46.454 --> 10:48.776
- You ready for this?
- Uh-huh.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.676
You ready, Dennis?

10:55.763 --> 10:57.593
Surprise, Dennis.

11:00.768 --> 11:02.630
Mirror.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.687
I think it'd look good on the wall there,
between the windows. Yeah.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.969
Where am I supposed to put my Habitrails?

11:12.312 --> 11:14.968
Where did you put all of my stuff?

11:15.048 --> 11:18.005
- Where's all of it going?
- It's mostly still in here, Dennis.

11:18.085 --> 11:23.545
No, no, that... smelly old box
is where my robots used to be.

11:25.376 --> 11:29.650
And that scary statue
is where I kept my comics.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.152
I had to put one or two things down
in the storage room, Dennis.

11:32.232 --> 11:35.355
You wanna move my Habitrail
into the storage room?

11:35.435 --> 11:39.259
- Well, Dennis...
- Anyway, I don't like this mirror.

11:39.339 --> 11:41.562
And I don't want it in this room.

11:41.642 --> 11:44.298
Dennis, look at the shape of this frame...

11:44.878 --> 11:46.699
...compared to the shape of the window.

11:46.779 --> 11:50.403
It's the same kind of wood
stained with the same kind of stain.

11:50.483 --> 11:52.540
It matches the character
of the house perfectly.

11:52.620 --> 11:55.776
It even matches the motif of the furniture
that you and I chose ourselves.

11:55.856 --> 11:58.078
Use all the big words you want...

11:58.158 --> 12:02.576
...you know I won't be able to argue
with all of your big words.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.232
- I've seen this mirror before.
- Well, I doubt that.

12:05.312 --> 12:07.254
- No, I have seen it.
- It's unlikely, Dennis.

12:07.334 --> 12:09.326
It wasn't just locked up in a vault.

12:09.406 --> 12:11.732
If you surprised us all,
and proved yourself a safecracker...

12:11.812 --> 12:13.536
- ...you still wouldn't have found it.
- I know that.

12:13.616 --> 12:16.234
Well, there's a vault within a vault.
Did you know that?

12:16.314 --> 12:19.296
A prohibition vault. A place where
back in the day of Prohibition...

12:19.376 --> 12:21.627
...when booze was illegal,
people used to hide their booze.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.896
I don't think anyone has been in that room
since the original owners...

12:23.976 --> 12:26.940
...because what I found in that room is
worth enough to pay this mortgage for a year.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.678
Well, I've been down
in there and I saw the stuff.

12:30.758 --> 12:34.217
- I saw the mirror and I hated it even then.
- Really? Really, Dennis when was this?

12:34.297 --> 12:37.511
- When was this?
- Last night.

12:37.591 --> 12:41.021
The mirror wasn't even in the house last
night, it was in town getting restored for you.

12:41.101 --> 12:46.126
No, it's not for me.
You just want to get rid of my hamsters.

12:46.306 --> 12:50.596
Dennis, your hamsters really smell bad.

12:50.677 --> 12:53.801
Now, the mirror really looks good.

12:53.881 --> 12:56.170
Put the mirror in your room.

12:56.850 --> 12:59.372
It's just one week, that's all I'm asking.

12:59.452 --> 13:03.113
Just... just see if the mirror grows on you.

13:03.193 --> 13:05.846
No, it's not going to grow on me.

13:05.926 --> 13:08.528
Because I don't like anything
you put in here.

13:08.608 --> 13:11.885
This isn't my room anymore, it's your room.

13:11.965 --> 13:16.123
But this is the worst thing,
because the chair, I just don't like it.

13:16.203 --> 13:20.260
But the mirror I hate, and I'm gonna
break the mirror right now.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.095
- Hey, hey.
- John!

13:22.175 --> 13:23.776
Dennis, calm down.

13:32.786 --> 13:34.876
I'm sorry, Dennis.

13:35.556 --> 13:37.386
I'm sorry.

13:41.962 --> 13:45.218
All right, Dennis, just look,
you know, a couple of days.

13:45.498 --> 13:48.656
Just a couple of days,
is not too much to ask, all right?

13:48.736 --> 13:51.996
And you... you can keep your hamsters.

13:54.641 --> 13:57.931
A couple of days, you're going
to love the mirror, Dennis.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.041
You're going to love that mirror.

14:04.251 --> 14:08.481
You can't tell me what I like or don't like.

14:10.657 --> 14:12.813
With the right wood.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.649
With the right stain.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.819
With the right motif.

14:19.699 --> 14:24.549
Using all these big words,
thinking he knows everything.

14:26.006 --> 14:30.064
Knowing big words doesn't make him right.

14:31.544 --> 14:35.950
Knowing big words
doesn't even make him smart.

14:37.651 --> 14:40.742
Just makes him know big words.

14:41.822 --> 14:46.114
No matter how many long,
50-cent words he uses...

14:46.194 --> 14:49.216
...he can't tell me to like you.

14:49.296 --> 14:51.186
I like you.

14:57.705 --> 15:00.725
I like you a lot.

15:06.146 --> 15:08.603
We both know where the stress is coming from.

15:09.382 --> 15:11.772
Just... just put him in a hospital.

15:11.852 --> 15:13.774
That's why I want
to redecorate his bedroom...

15:13.854 --> 15:15.909
...so we can sell the place
so I can put him in a hospital.

15:15.989 --> 15:18.445
We could sell this place
tomorrow, unfurnished.

15:18.525 --> 15:21.714
This is a summer town. People that
buy here want a summer retreat.

15:21.794 --> 15:23.516
They want it finished. Furnished.

15:23.596 --> 15:26.253
Yes, and I would agree with you
if we had unlimited time...

15:26.333 --> 15:28.823
...but you're a time bomb, sweetie.

15:30.003 --> 15:34.051
- We could put Dennis in...
- I'm not putting Dennis in a state hospital.

15:36.076 --> 15:39.366
This train hit my dog right in the ass.

15:39.446 --> 15:42.835
Rectum, said the teacher, rectum.

15:42.915 --> 15:46.480
So, I said, "Rectum?

15:46.560 --> 15:49.422
It fucking killed him."

15:50.623 --> 15:52.745
Thank you, thank you.

15:52.825 --> 15:55.083
You're too kind.

15:55.863 --> 16:00.954
I tell nice, simple jokes.
I use no big words.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.356
Aw, thank you.

16:03.436 --> 16:06.126
Hey, stop throwing your panties on the stage.

16:06.206 --> 16:09.096
It's really disruptive.

16:09.576 --> 16:11.258
Destruct...

16:11.475 --> 16:14.277
...disturbs my concentra...

16:14.514 --> 16:16.069
See?

16:16.649 --> 16:18.438
No big words.

16:18.518 --> 16:20.348
Thank you.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.644
You tell jokes everyone can understand.

16:27.594 --> 16:30.984
John's jokes only make sense to John.

16:31.064 --> 16:34.487
You don't get his jokes,
but everyone else does.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.138
Why?

16:37.370 --> 16:39.793
'Cause they're about you.

16:40.473 --> 16:45.747
In his mind everything
that makes him sad or angry...

16:46.313 --> 16:48.543
...is your fault.

16:53.285 --> 16:56.236
- How did you get past my gate?
- Oh, please excuse my breach.

16:56.316 --> 17:00.012
My name is Mildy Torres.
I work with Social Services.

17:00.092 --> 17:03.265
- And?
- And we got a tip on our hotline...

17:03.345 --> 17:07.520
...that you've been losing
your temper around Dennis.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.656
But when we saw Dennis yesterday,
he seemed fine.

17:10.737 --> 17:12.811
No marks, no bruises.

17:12.892 --> 17:14.903
Who said I was losing my temper?

17:14.983 --> 17:17.396
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

17:17.476 --> 17:19.036
Yeah.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.810
Please.

17:33.994 --> 17:37.274
We just wanna make sure that you're
the right person to take care of Dennis...

17:37.354 --> 17:42.289
...because, frankly, it's a responsibility
some people shouldn't be trusted with.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.391
- I can handle it.
- Are you sure?

17:44.471 --> 17:49.079
Because taking care of a mentally challenged
person can be a real handful sometimes.

17:49.659 --> 17:52.465
Wouldn't it be a load off
if the state could take care of Dennis?

17:52.545 --> 17:54.952
There's an opening in Green Valley.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.103
That would be fantastic.

17:57.183 --> 18:01.241
No, it wouldn't be.
Please excuse us, Lydia. Thank you.

18:01.721 --> 18:04.911
- I don't want Dennis in Green Valley.
- Don't you want a break?

18:04.991 --> 18:08.548
I mean, it all adds up. Taking care
of a mentally challenged person...

18:08.628 --> 18:11.071
...it just wears on you and wears on you.

18:12.164 --> 18:14.221
It changes your personality.

18:14.901 --> 18:17.161
Do you know where it would show up first?

18:19.372 --> 18:21.161
- Where?
- Well, why don't you take a guess?

18:21.241 --> 18:24.164
- I could give you some...
- I asked you where, Mildy.

18:24.244 --> 18:28.101
Your patience.
You would become very impatient.

18:28.981 --> 18:32.993
- Do you know where it would show up second?
- I don't have time for these games.

18:33.853 --> 18:37.010
Your temper. Your temper would go next.

18:37.090 --> 18:41.392
And a short-tempered man is not fit to be
custodian of a mentally-challenged one.

18:42.795 --> 18:44.851
Is this some sort of experiment?

18:44.931 --> 18:49.322
You want a reaction. You keep asking me
if I have a temper, you're gonna find one.

18:49.402 --> 18:52.425
Well, you're not dumb, I'll give you that.

18:52.505 --> 18:56.137
Your lab is contaminating your experiment.
You're completely prejudiced. I am angry.

18:56.217 --> 18:58.550
How can the state split up my family?
I'm not a criminal.

18:58.630 --> 19:03.603
You don't have to be one. Social Services
can remove a child from a suspect parent...

19:03.683 --> 19:06.472
...on the strength
of one anonymous phone call.

19:06.552 --> 19:09.663
Okay, so let me get this straight.
I can make a phone call...

19:09.743 --> 19:13.575
...about anyone at random, without giving
my name and a person like you...

19:13.655 --> 19:16.741
...will show up at their door
and remove their children?

19:16.821 --> 19:18.869
- That's right.
- And that's legal?

19:18.949 --> 19:23.290
A lot of people thought it was a necessary
law that was a long time in coming.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.259
We call those people idiots, Mildy.

19:26.539 --> 19:28.595
Temper, temper.

19:28.675 --> 19:31.395
You know, uh, this has been amazing, Mildy.

19:31.478 --> 19:35.505
- We must do this again sometime.
- Oh, we will, we will.

19:45.892 --> 19:48.915
Dr. Preston, John Peterson.

19:48.995 --> 19:51.015
I need to come and see you.

19:51.097 --> 19:54.762
No, not next week. Now, man. Right now.

19:56.002 --> 20:00.327
This bitch, Mildy Torres
from Social Services...

20:00.407 --> 20:04.262
...shows up at my front door, finagles her
way in and tells me I'm under investigation...

20:04.342 --> 20:08.268
- ...that I might lose Dennis.
- Why are you under investigation?

20:08.348 --> 20:11.338
She said someone complained
that I've been losing my temper...

20:11.418 --> 20:13.135
...violently.

20:14.587 --> 20:17.047
Now she doesn't think Dennis is safe with me.

20:18.491 --> 20:20.773
You're very tense, John.

20:20.853 --> 20:25.352
But that's normal, right?
The situation I'm in justifies my tension.

20:25.432 --> 20:29.833
No, it legitimizes it.
It does not justify it.

20:31.804 --> 20:35.362
The last time we spoke, all you could
talk about was moving away from Dennis...

20:35.442 --> 20:38.498
- ...finding a care facility for him.
- Yeah, and I still want that.

20:38.578 --> 20:41.601
Then why didn't you give Dennis
the choice of going to Social Services?

20:41.681 --> 20:44.304
Because she would've sent him to Green
Valley. Have you seen the fucking place?

20:44.384 --> 20:47.039
- I volunteer there twice a week.
- Okay, well, it's fine.

20:47.119 --> 20:48.821
It's just not right for Dennis.

20:49.621 --> 20:52.945
You want a private hospital. How badly?

20:53.025 --> 20:54.885
How soon?

20:56.529 --> 20:58.985
Oh, Christ, Doc.

20:59.065 --> 21:01.121
I don't even have a life anymore.

21:01.701 --> 21:04.531
All I do, I... I care for Dennis 24/7.

21:04.611 --> 21:08.977
If he's not in the car I don't know what
station to put it on. I just scan and I scan.

21:09.057 --> 21:11.330
I don't even know my own taste in music.

21:11.410 --> 21:14.501
You have got to get out of there.

21:14.581 --> 21:16.870
Losing your identity...

21:17.250 --> 21:20.893
...that's a pretty,
pretty serious sign, John.

21:21.753 --> 21:26.123
He's my responsibility.
I can't dump him in someone else's lap.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.317
I owe him. No else can pay my debt.

21:30.397 --> 21:31.957
Debt?

21:33.598 --> 21:35.609
What do you owe him?

21:37.404 --> 21:42.474
And Susan is handing me ice cream...

21:43.960 --> 21:46.617
...and she's dropped a little...

21:47.247 --> 21:49.436
...and is slipping in it.

21:50.016 --> 21:53.340
Looks like she's gonna crack her skull.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.641
Oh, but luckily there's...

21:56.721 --> 21:58.924
...a pillow on the floor.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.801
Or a pillow case full of broken glass.

22:04.731 --> 22:06.853
But I rush in...

22:06.933 --> 22:09.489
...and I catch her...

22:09.569 --> 22:12.793
...and throw her on the glass.

22:13.273 --> 22:14.862
Stop.

22:15.942 --> 22:18.365
This is ruining the drawing.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.236
John.

22:33.316 --> 22:35.808
No. I don't even like that tone.

22:36.428 --> 22:38.985
We're not gonna fight, are we?

22:39.065 --> 22:42.146
No, you're not gonna itemize the way
in which I disappoint you. Not today.

22:42.226 --> 22:43.998
Yes, I am.

22:51.911 --> 22:55.981
What do I think John and Lydia are doing?

23:00.853 --> 23:04.077
They're discussing big ideas.

23:04.757 --> 23:08.461
With big 50-cent words in them.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.851
You can see how overwrought I am.
I don't have time today to fucking breathe.

23:11.931 --> 23:14.921
And yet you do nothing about
your overwhelming lifestyle.

23:15.001 --> 23:18.791
If it were as difficult as you claim, then
you would've done something about it by now.

23:18.871 --> 23:22.312
But you haven't, so it seems to me
that you like the situation you're in.

23:22.392 --> 23:25.164
Makes you seem selfless...

23:25.244 --> 23:28.193
- ...gives you room to operate.
- Operate?

23:28.273 --> 23:32.338
Well, no one would ever question
or even suspect a tireless martyr.

23:32.418 --> 23:34.658
Suspect me of what?

23:35.855 --> 23:38.312
You're never gonna marry me, John, are you?

23:39.892 --> 23:44.158
You've got the perfect excuse
to stay single and not look like a cad.

23:45.697 --> 23:46.889
You've got Dennis.

23:46.969 --> 23:51.891
They're right on the edge
of having another huge argument...

23:51.971 --> 23:54.001
...as always.

23:57.977 --> 24:01.467
Why do they even stay together?

24:06.586 --> 24:08.775
They both must like to argue...

24:08.855 --> 24:13.545
...but neither one of them
will ever admit it.

24:17.063 --> 24:21.293
What's tonight's argument about?

24:25.738 --> 24:28.361
Lydia's trying to convince John...

24:28.441 --> 24:32.565
...that you're the reason
there's so much tension.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.535
He's resisting...

24:35.615 --> 24:38.475
...but her will is stronger.

24:39.752 --> 24:44.310
It's just a matter of time
until she has him...

24:44.390 --> 24:46.253
...convinced...

24:46.959 --> 24:50.699
...that his life would be
a whole lot easier...

24:50.779 --> 24:54.780
...without a big dribbling mongoloid in it.

25:00.106 --> 25:02.529
Look, we're not gonna do this again, are we?

25:03.209 --> 25:05.031
Do what?

25:05.711 --> 25:07.627
Break up, wait a month...

25:07.707 --> 25:11.037
...realize there's nobody better out there
and get back together again?

25:11.117 --> 25:13.660
Ah, come on.
It was not even that big of a fight.

25:14.620 --> 25:16.783
That was just a discussion.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.846
I never could tell the difference
between fights and discussions.

25:19.926 --> 25:22.346
I was always surprised as to which was which.

25:22.428 --> 25:26.832
Well, you could ask me
which it is as we're going. Huh?

25:29.802 --> 25:32.625
So, uh, which is this?

25:33.105 --> 25:35.025
What we're doing right now?

25:35.107 --> 25:36.667
Yeah.

25:38.678 --> 25:39.966
This is foreplay.

25:40.046 --> 25:43.269
Do you think I'm retarded?

25:43.349 --> 25:46.349
Uh, just a second, Dennis.

25:49.255 --> 25:51.775
It's okay. I'll see you later.

25:52.659 --> 25:54.189
Okay.

25:57.063 --> 26:00.419
Shit. Okay, now what's going on?

26:00.499 --> 26:05.424
Do you think I'm a big dribbling mongoloid?

26:05.504 --> 26:08.094
Where do you get these ideas, Dennis?

26:08.334 --> 26:12.765
I don't think you're that big. Dribble
you do, and mongoloid you are, but big?

26:12.845 --> 26:16.676
- Well, that's just wishful thinking, buddy.
- No, I'm not a mongoloid.

26:17.784 --> 26:21.818
- I was just kidding.
- Well, you should stop. I'm not retarded.

26:21.898 --> 26:24.677
I'm just slow.

26:24.757 --> 26:29.081
- I don't even think you're that slow, buddy.
- No, I'm smarter than people think I am.

26:29.161 --> 26:33.186
I'm getting smarter and smarter all the time.

26:34.366 --> 26:36.186
I know you are.

26:37.503 --> 26:42.742
I'm not afraid to look at myself
in the mirror anymore.

29:48.628 --> 29:51.217
Oh, wow. Bad dreams, buddy?

29:51.297 --> 29:54.585
- Yeah, yeah.
- I borrowed one of your ties.

29:54.666 --> 29:57.757
- You don't really use 'em anyway.
- Okay.

29:58.437 --> 30:00.097
You can have it.

30:03.052 --> 30:05.131
I gotta talk to you.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.466
I need to know.

30:07.546 --> 30:10.956
A dream is a story I tell myself, right?

30:11.883 --> 30:13.790
What do you mean exactly?

30:13.870 --> 30:15.872
I tell myself a story.

30:15.952 --> 30:20.629
One part of my brain tells
another part of my brain a story.

30:21.359 --> 30:24.396
Yeah. Yeah, it's a good way
of saying it, I guess.

30:24.476 --> 30:27.686
Well, if it's a story I tell me...

30:28.567 --> 30:30.923
...how can I trick myself?

30:31.003 --> 30:33.826
Well, wait. What do you mean?

30:33.906 --> 30:38.731
You can't tell yourself a joke
and not see the punch line coming.

30:38.811 --> 30:41.918
What, you... you think someone else
is telling you these stories?

30:42.748 --> 30:44.778
I think that...

30:47.319 --> 30:48.975
...that it has to be.

30:49.155 --> 30:52.144
- Someone like...
- Me?

31:44.510 --> 31:47.204
I scared you.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.856
I was not scared.

31:53.936 --> 31:57.443
You're scared of some of your own hamsters.

31:58.023 --> 32:01.047
We gotta do something about it.

32:01.727 --> 32:03.833
We gotta fix the scare.

32:03.913 --> 32:07.900
How can you make me not scared anymore?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.843
We have to stop the nightmares.

32:12.603 --> 32:15.461
How can we stop the nightmares?

32:16.441 --> 32:19.466
We have to fix our brain.

32:20.646 --> 32:24.666
We have to get better and become smart.

32:25.784 --> 32:27.807
There's a way to do it...

32:27.887 --> 32:31.293
...but nobody tells you how.

32:32.323 --> 32:37.039
Why don't they just tell me
how to get better?

32:37.119 --> 32:39.817
Because it's a test.

32:40.766 --> 32:44.356
They make up rules that are lies...

32:44.436 --> 32:48.396
...to see if you'll be
dumb enough to believe them.

32:50.576 --> 32:52.726
So what do I do?

32:53.078 --> 32:56.052
Follow only the real rules.

32:56.482 --> 32:59.252
How do I do that?

33:01.187 --> 33:04.178
You gotta go kill a kitty cat.

33:06.058 --> 33:07.879
Why?

33:08.259 --> 33:11.551
It's what you're supposed to do.

33:12.831 --> 33:16.723
They say it's bad to kill kitty cats.

33:17.303 --> 33:20.126
But you like eating meat, right?

33:20.606 --> 33:24.431
So farmers can kill animals, right?

33:25.411 --> 33:28.835
See? That's the clue they gave you.

33:29.615 --> 33:32.505
They serve you meat.

33:34.486 --> 33:36.780
They're testing your...

33:37.389 --> 33:42.299
...gullibility when they say
it's bad to kill animals.

33:44.330 --> 33:47.019
If you kill a cat...

33:47.599 --> 33:52.684
...you can prove that you know
which rules are fake.

33:53.472 --> 33:58.233
And they'll all know you're becoming smarter.

33:59.277 --> 34:01.450
You really think so?

34:01.530 --> 34:04.621
We have to be brave.

34:05.901 --> 34:09.525
We have to kill our neighbor's cat.

34:10.406 --> 34:12.226
The tabby.

34:24.719 --> 34:27.750
But that kitty likes me.

34:29.824 --> 34:33.455
That'll make it easier to catch.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.405
Psst, psst, psst, psst...

35:11.567 --> 35:14.456
I did very good work today.

35:14.536 --> 35:19.076
I did many kitties and many doggies.

35:27.483 --> 35:32.174
This... this taxidermy cassette...

35:32.254 --> 35:35.144
...it's very important.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.079
Why?

35:37.159 --> 35:42.441
It's gonna teach you what to do with
the kitties and doggies you bring back.

35:43.381 --> 35:46.331
Grab a doggy from the cooler.

35:57.913 --> 36:02.743
You're holding a new paint brush, Dennis.

36:43.159 --> 36:47.048
Hey, buddy, I didn't even know you knew
how to do anything involving wood work.

36:47.128 --> 36:51.352
I'm getting better and better at it.

36:51.432 --> 36:53.022
Can I see?

36:53.102 --> 36:55.762
- Oh, not yet.
- Why not?

36:57.773 --> 37:01.697
Well, you get your private office.

37:01.777 --> 37:04.866
Why can't this be my private office?

37:04.946 --> 37:08.317
Why can't this be where my work stays...

37:08.397 --> 37:10.608
- ...just for me?
- Oh, no, brother. I gotta see this.

37:10.688 --> 37:14.651
I'll show you all of it in a few days.

37:16.892 --> 37:18.780
"Taxidermy."

37:19.160 --> 37:22.218
"Forensic..." why do you have these tapes?

37:22.298 --> 37:25.154
Why do you wanna know about
butchery and leather care...

37:25.234 --> 37:27.664
...and taxidermy, especially forensics?

37:30.171 --> 37:32.794
What is that smell? No, Dennis,
I'm definitely coming in there.

37:32.874 --> 37:36.465
No, no. Those aren't my cassettes.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.918
They got in my bag by mistake.

37:39.998 --> 37:43.172
You know, Dennis, I might believe that
if there was one cassette on one topic...

37:43.252 --> 37:47.143
...maybe two, but not four.
These didn't fall into someone's bag.

37:47.223 --> 37:50.880
Someone went shopping for these
and placed them in a bag.

37:52.660 --> 37:56.184
Yes, but that someone...

37:56.264 --> 37:58.294
...wasn't me.

37:58.834 --> 38:01.290
So you picked up someone else's bag?

38:01.870 --> 38:03.225
Yeah.

38:03.305 --> 38:07.928
I got their books on tape and they got mine.

38:09.178 --> 38:11.833
Well, thank God, because this is, uh...

38:11.913 --> 38:15.135
...that's... that... excuse me, buddy.

38:30.566 --> 38:33.186
- Hey, babe, come on in.
- Nuh-uh, you come out.

38:33.268 --> 38:35.223
Come on, let's get something to eat.

38:35.303 --> 38:38.627
Uh, okay. Hang on a second. Hey, uh, Dennis.

38:38.707 --> 38:41.397
You gonna be okay for a couple hours?
I'm gonna go out with Lydia.

38:41.477 --> 38:43.537
Yeah, I'll be fine.

38:48.216 --> 38:52.074
You know, just before you picked me up
I had a nasty scare.

38:52.554 --> 38:54.476
What happened?

38:54.556 --> 38:57.115
I heard a hammer pounding
down in the basement.

38:57.195 --> 39:00.115
So I went down to investigate.
It couldn't be Dennis.

39:00.195 --> 39:02.451
Dennis doesn't know anything about carpentry.

39:02.531 --> 39:07.023
But it is Dennis, suddenly looking
a lot like a professional carpenter.

39:08.003 --> 39:12.314
But the fact that he's doing something
skillfully is exciting, but it's also scary.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.263
What's he building?

39:14.543 --> 39:17.165
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

39:17.245 --> 39:20.636
It doesn't really matter. Even if it's
an atrocity it want be an eyesore...

39:20.716 --> 39:24.906
- ...because it's down in the basement.
- Aren't you the slightest bit curious?

39:24.986 --> 39:27.242
I mean, when's he gonna show you?

39:27.322 --> 39:29.612
He said he would show me in a couple of days.

39:30.592 --> 39:32.481
You know...

39:32.661 --> 39:36.468
...you should've seen him with his
tool belt and his protective goggles.

39:36.798 --> 39:38.920
What if he could become a carpenter?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.856
Get a job.

39:41.336 --> 39:43.542
Look at you. You're so proud of him.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.432
You'd make a great dad.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.898
Well, I wanna be a dad.

39:49.478 --> 39:51.468
I wanna be your husband.

39:52.381 --> 39:55.070
And I wanna know what you call those...

39:55.150 --> 39:58.440
...turbine engine-driven ceramic
and titanium vehicles...

39:58.520 --> 40:00.809
...you see maybe once or twice in a lifetime.

40:00.889 --> 40:04.381
I never remember what they're called.
But what do you call that?

40:07.563 --> 40:11.036
- I can't believe I fell for that.
- They're very fast.

40:15.053 --> 40:18.081
- What is this?
- I have no idea.

40:21.677 --> 40:25.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Those look a lot like the earrings...

40:25.654 --> 40:28.136
...that you saw in Aspen that you fell
in love with that I couldn't afford.

40:28.216 --> 40:32.907
Now this is wrapping up much
too neatly to be a coincidence. No.

40:32.988 --> 40:35.377
Okay, what's wrong?

40:35.457 --> 40:37.979
Are they not the right earrings?

40:38.059 --> 40:40.189
Why did you set me up like that?

40:41.130 --> 40:43.277
Set you up like what?

40:45.100 --> 40:47.689
We were talking about marriage...

40:47.769 --> 40:49.391
...children.

40:49.471 --> 40:51.027
Earrings?

40:52.047 --> 40:55.697
<i>But with spiders the challenge
is of a different nature.</i>

40:56.077 --> 40:58.534
<i>Spiders are not social animals.</i>

40:58.614 --> 41:00.709
<i>They have no families.</i>

41:02.918 --> 41:06.508
<i>If the spider's gene is to last
into the next generation...</i>

41:06.588 --> 41:08.844
<i>...he must approach the female by stealth...</i>

41:08.924 --> 41:11.012
<i>...careful not to be seen by her.</i>

41:11.092 --> 41:16.011
<i>Because spiders are cannibals,
and females are much larger than males.</i>

41:16.331 --> 41:18.954
I would give you a ring today
if you would live with Dennis.

41:19.034 --> 41:23.825
When I said I wanted a baby,
I meant the small kind, the cute kind.

41:23.905 --> 41:26.945
Not the 30-year-old masturbating kind.

41:31.512 --> 41:33.469
<i>...the procreative act complete.</i>

41:33.549 --> 41:38.073
<i>The male spider must now escape her web
before she catches and eats him.</i>

41:38.153 --> 41:42.978
<i>To her the male is not a husband,
not a mate, not even another spider.</i>

41:43.058 --> 41:46.663
<i>To the female, the male is merely food.</i>

41:48.630 --> 41:53.055
<i>Australia is home to the world's
most venomous spiders.</i>

41:53.735 --> 41:56.425
<i>Notable amongst them is the funnel-web.</i>

41:57.205 --> 41:59.961
<i>Unique not only for its deadly poison...</i>

42:00.041 --> 42:02.931
<i>...but for its inexplicably
aggressive behavior.</i>

42:03.011 --> 42:06.669
<i>It will, unprovoked, charge anyone it sees.</i>

42:10.986 --> 42:13.409
<i>Which raises the question, why?</i>

42:13.989 --> 42:17.713
<i>If it doesn't have a soul, it will
bite you without a second thought...</i>

42:17.793 --> 42:20.216
<i>...because it doesn't have a first.</i>

42:20.696 --> 42:24.420
<i>If it does have a soul, it will
bite you because it doesn't like you...</i>

42:24.500 --> 42:26.530
<i>...you fucking retard.</i>

42:29.237 --> 42:34.195
It would need a soul
to appreciate your disgust...

42:34.275 --> 42:37.365
...with its soullessness.

42:37.446 --> 42:39.822
Look at those eyes...

42:40.582 --> 42:43.740
...those lifeless black spheres.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.343
Could they be looking back?

42:48.123 --> 42:49.711
No.

42:50.191 --> 42:53.861
No, not these eyes.

42:58.133 --> 43:00.803
Those eyes.

43:17.753 --> 43:21.183
I'll let you wake up if you do a job for me.

43:22.423 --> 43:24.313
Say yes...

43:24.893 --> 43:27.917
...and your dreams will be
pleasant for a long time.

43:28.597 --> 43:30.452
Say no...

43:31.032 --> 43:34.272
...and I'll knock off the training wheels.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.694
If you think this was bad...

43:38.874 --> 43:40.397
...wait.

43:43.879 --> 43:45.967
You have to do this.

43:46.547 --> 43:49.382
You have to go get a boy...

43:49.462 --> 43:52.819
...get a little boy
if you want to get better.

43:53.889 --> 43:56.494
I have to kill a little boy?

43:56.574 --> 43:59.848
Or a little girl. It doesn't matter.

43:59.928 --> 44:01.998
It has to be a child.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.614
Why?

44:06.694 --> 44:11.727
'Cause that's what we'll need to do
to prove that we're not stupid.

44:11.807 --> 44:14.630
It's the next step in the test.

44:15.110 --> 44:19.201
Once you realize killing animals isn't bad...

44:19.581 --> 44:23.805
...it soon gets clear
that all killing isn't bad.

44:24.485 --> 44:28.075
To learn killing animals is okay...

44:28.156 --> 44:31.246
...they gave you meat as a clue.

44:31.727 --> 44:35.183
You don't know how many times
your meat at dinner time...

44:35.263 --> 44:37.893
...was someone you knew.

44:40.101 --> 44:43.191
I ate kids at dinner?

44:43.971 --> 44:45.861
Many times.

44:46.341 --> 44:48.764
Everybody kills little boys and girls...

44:48.844 --> 44:51.099
...and they're all disappointed in you...

44:51.179 --> 44:53.803
...because you haven't done it.

44:54.883 --> 44:58.307
It's only a few hours until dawn.

44:59.087 --> 45:01.347
Go out and kill a kid.

46:29.910 --> 46:32.140
Why'd I do that?

46:46.127 --> 46:47.650
Why?

46:49.130 --> 46:53.622
It's not helping me.
I... I don't feel smarter.

46:54.102 --> 46:57.025
Nobody says I'm acting smarter.

46:57.305 --> 46:59.428
You did good work...

46:59.508 --> 47:01.376
...very good work.

47:01.976 --> 47:04.099
All we did was...

47:04.179 --> 47:06.435
...kill three kids.

47:07.815 --> 47:11.072
I'm just as dumb as I ever was.

47:11.652 --> 47:13.927
We did very well.

47:14.790 --> 47:17.979
And I have to tell you a secret now.

47:18.459 --> 47:20.976
This isn't helping me.

47:21.296 --> 47:24.120
I gotta tell you a secret.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.554
Lean in close.

47:27.234 --> 47:29.858
This isn't helping me.

47:35.110 --> 47:37.365
When you're sleeping at night...

47:37.545 --> 47:40.435
...I'm the one who whispers in your ear.

47:40.966 --> 47:43.569
Sorry about the stories I tell...

47:44.152 --> 47:46.983
...but it's just a little darker over here.

47:52.393 --> 47:54.195
Thank you.

48:02.838 --> 48:06.300
- Thank you for meeting me, Dr. Preston.
- Of course. Have a seat.

48:10.211 --> 48:12.417
You need more sessions with me, right?

48:12.497 --> 48:16.172
- Desperately.
- And you can't afford them, right?

48:17.352 --> 48:19.244
Not really, no.

48:19.855 --> 48:23.611
What if I give you my lunchtime every day
for a month? We wouldn't be in session.

48:23.691 --> 48:26.554
We'd be having lunch together as friends
so I wouldn't have to charge you.

48:26.634 --> 48:28.850
That would be great.

48:28.930 --> 48:31.823
I do expect a fee, just not a cash fee.

48:32.453 --> 48:33.938
What do you want?

48:34.018 --> 48:38.994
You can't skirt issues by claiming
they're not what you want to talk about.

48:39.074 --> 48:42.931
If I want to talk about the house and the car
you can't afford, you must play along.

48:43.011 --> 48:44.766
Fair enough?

48:44.846 --> 48:47.953
So it's half therapy, half browbeating?

48:48.033 --> 48:50.538
More like 90 percent therapy
you think you need...

48:50.618 --> 48:52.946
...and ten percent therapy I think you need.

48:53.026 --> 48:55.080
That's fine.

48:55.756 --> 48:59.380
Well, we'll start with
what you think your problems are.

49:00.460 --> 49:02.650
Who are you?

49:02.730 --> 49:04.820
I'm not just one.

49:05.500 --> 49:07.756
I've been called legion.

49:08.436 --> 49:10.191
I am many.

49:10.271 --> 49:12.294
Where are you?

49:13.774 --> 49:15.696
I'm right here.

49:15.776 --> 49:17.598
The dark place...

49:17.678 --> 49:20.165
...where is the dark place?

49:21.616 --> 49:23.504
I'm not sure.

49:23.584 --> 49:25.807
I couldn't show you on a map.

49:26.687 --> 49:28.910
I do know this though...

49:29.590 --> 49:32.080
...no one here ever wanted to come...

49:32.360 --> 49:35.050
...but you, oh, Dennis...

49:35.130 --> 49:37.218
...you would love it here.

49:37.298 --> 49:41.722
If you came here, you'd be happy
for the rest of your life.

49:41.802 --> 49:45.131
If I went there,
I'd be happy for the rest of mine.

49:46.241 --> 49:49.330
So what do we do?

49:49.810 --> 49:52.233
Just keep doing what you're doing.

49:52.813 --> 49:54.870
It'll make you smarter.

49:54.950 --> 49:58.039
It'll make me able to go where you are.

49:58.919 --> 50:02.677
It's a good deal all the way around.

50:02.757 --> 50:05.431
Just keep doing what you're doing.

50:07.026 --> 50:09.516
What do you look like?

50:10.097 --> 50:11.987
You wanna see me?

50:12.067 --> 50:15.497
Take this mirror
and point it at the closet mirror.

50:29.283 --> 50:31.307
Take a step back.

50:32.187 --> 50:35.047
Look down the hallway into infinity.

50:42.562 --> 50:45.320
Is... is that you?

50:45.400 --> 50:47.775
I didn't choose to look this way.

50:48.735 --> 50:52.259
Why should I help you anymore?

50:52.339 --> 50:53.914
You hurt me.

50:53.994 --> 50:57.265
Who's really hurting you? Me?

50:57.345 --> 51:00.595
- Or Susan?
- Susan likes me.

51:00.675 --> 51:03.695
She wouldn't fuck you
with someone else's pussy.

51:04.918 --> 51:08.276
- Why?
- She wouldn't fuck a retard.

51:08.356 --> 51:10.278
How revolting.

51:10.358 --> 51:14.395
But a serial killer... ah, how exciting.

51:14.475 --> 51:16.887
How intriguing. How mysterious.

51:16.967 --> 51:20.634
You know what makes you
so unattractive in Susan's eyes?

51:21.569 --> 51:24.893
- No.
- She thinks you couldn't hurt a fly.

51:24.973 --> 51:27.429
She thinks you're insignificant.

51:28.609 --> 51:32.467
If you killed her, she'd die screaming...

51:32.547 --> 51:34.470
...she'd die in agony...

51:35.150 --> 51:39.175
...but she'd die wet between the legs.

51:40.555 --> 51:42.443
Am I really your enemy?

51:42.523 --> 51:44.779
Tsk, tsk, Dennis...

51:44.859 --> 51:46.882
...I'm your only friend.

51:47.762 --> 51:50.050
I'm hungry, Dennis.

51:50.130 --> 51:52.431
Let's go get some ice cream.

52:08.283 --> 52:09.843
Hello?

53:38.973 --> 53:41.762
Oh, my God, Dennis.

53:41.842 --> 53:43.865
Thank God it's you.

53:44.345 --> 53:45.400
Hi.

53:45.480 --> 53:49.036
What's up with the hand in the coat?
You hiding a concealed weapon or something?

53:50.451 --> 53:52.355
- Uh, no. It's a...
- No?

53:52.435 --> 53:55.343
...a new notebook I got here.

53:55.423 --> 54:00.463
I'm gonna write down notes
in it and keep them.

54:01.696 --> 54:03.519
Can you read?

54:04.799 --> 54:06.638
Well, uh...

54:06.718 --> 54:10.613
...no, but what I've kinda been doing is...

54:10.693 --> 54:14.395
...asking other people to write down notes...

54:14.475 --> 54:16.964
...and then when I get home...

54:17.044 --> 54:20.251
...I ask John to read them to me.

54:20.331 --> 54:23.191
That's the coolest thing
that I've ever heard.

54:24.519 --> 54:28.542
I was hoping...

54:28.622 --> 54:30.395
...you'd write me a note.

54:31.025 --> 54:32.580
I would love to, Dennis.

54:32.660 --> 54:35.550
- Take a letter, Susan.
- Okay.

54:36.330 --> 54:37.919
To...

54:38.199 --> 54:42.405
...whomever it may concern, I...

54:42.485 --> 54:45.993
...Susan Hill, being of...

54:46.473 --> 54:51.031
...sound mind and hot body...

54:52.713 --> 54:55.204
...am prepared to...

54:55.284 --> 54:57.772
...make the following confessions.

54:57.852 --> 55:00.808
I think Dennis Peterson...

55:00.888 --> 55:04.933
...is super keen and I would like...

55:05.013 --> 55:07.197
...to have his babies.

55:09.063 --> 55:13.928
I can't think of a way
to get him to ask me out...

55:14.008 --> 55:18.473
...or tell him that my idea
of a perfect date...

55:19.273 --> 55:22.163
...would include bumper cars...

55:22.243 --> 55:26.113
...and ice cream here in my own store.

55:32.587 --> 55:34.647
This is a joke, isn't it?

55:36.757 --> 55:38.279
Why?

55:38.609 --> 55:42.100
I would just feel more comfortable
if you were kidding.

55:42.630 --> 55:45.370
I mean, you're not really
asking me out, are you?

55:45.450 --> 55:47.902
Would it be so wrong if I did?

55:48.502 --> 55:51.591
Well, Dennis, I'm spoken for.

55:51.671 --> 55:55.390
No, you broke up with that guy two weeks ago.

55:55.470 --> 55:58.366
Yeah, I'm not...
I'm not ready to move on, Dennis.

55:58.446 --> 56:01.426
You can't just turn love off like a switch.

56:01.506 --> 56:04.598
You were only dating him for a month!

56:06.020 --> 56:08.720
Dennis, it... it wouldn't
work out between us.

57:38.346 --> 57:40.436
Are you lying, John?

57:42.116 --> 57:45.152
- No.
- Are you sure?

57:45.232 --> 57:48.876
When you continue lying to someone
whom you know knows you're lying...

57:48.956 --> 57:51.466
...that's when it can be called compulsive.

57:53.706 --> 57:56.401
- How do you know?
- Friendly word of advice, John.

57:56.481 --> 57:59.741
Steer clear of poker.
It wouldn't be your game.

58:03.303 --> 58:05.173
Quite a tell, huh?

58:17.017 --> 58:20.079
- Oh. Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.

58:30.665 --> 58:32.925
- Lydia.
- Hi, John.

58:34.769 --> 58:37.793
- Are you spying on me?
- No.

58:38.773 --> 58:41.203
No, I, uh, I just needed a ride.

58:42.477 --> 58:45.400
- Well, I'm going home.
- That's okay.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.302
You want company?

58:48.082 --> 58:51.510
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

58:57.792 --> 58:59.152
Thanks.

59:00.695 --> 59:02.750
What was our first date like?

59:02.830 --> 59:05.152
Feeling nostalgic? Sentimental?

59:05.232 --> 59:08.433
You wanna do it again, see if we
can recapture something, is that it?

59:13.874 --> 59:16.030
What are we doing down here?

59:16.110 --> 59:18.583
Dennis spends a lot of his
spare time down here these days.

59:18.663 --> 59:20.918
Oh, right, carpentry.

59:21.048 --> 59:22.878
The carpentry.

59:27.988 --> 59:29.910
Hey, Dennis.

59:29.990 --> 59:32.413
Come here, buddy. I got a surprise for you.

59:33.293 --> 59:37.250
What surprise? You know I love surprises.

59:37.330 --> 59:41.133
Well, come on out. Come on out
and I'll tell you all about it.

59:48.708 --> 59:52.299
Tonight, you're in charge.
Whatever you wanna do we'll do.

59:52.379 --> 59:54.409
All three of us.

59:59.754 --> 01:00:03.184
Let's go to the car, chop, chop.

01:00:07.962 --> 01:00:08.992
Dennis.

01:00:15.703 --> 01:00:18.485
<i># The girls are over here #</i>

01:00:18.565 --> 01:00:21.187
<i># The girls are over there #</i>

01:00:21.267 --> 01:00:24.031
<i># Love is in the air</i>

01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:26.689
<i># Yeah, the girl's are fair #</i>

01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:29.770
- Thank you.
- <i># Walking in the field #</i>

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.619
<i># Flower in the air</i>

01:00:32.699 --> 01:00:35.503
<i># Looking for a fling #</i>

01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:38.131
<i># With a millionaire ##</i>

01:00:40.395 --> 01:00:43.584
How do they make the things move?

01:00:43.664 --> 01:00:49.323
Like, the octopus, how do they
make all those eight big tentacles...

01:00:49.403 --> 01:00:52.260
...of the octopus move like that?

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.452
Well, it's animatronics, Dennis.
Very simple ones.

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:57.632
See the wires attached to the tentacles?

01:00:57.712 --> 01:01:00.735
They go up past the curtain where we
can't see them into a big plastic tube...

01:01:00.815 --> 01:01:02.302
...with a bunch of disks on it.

01:01:02.382 --> 01:01:05.920
It's not too unlike
a giant shish kabob skewer...

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.371
...put through old vinyl records.

01:01:10.925 --> 01:01:12.980
But it doesn't actually go through
the center, it's a little off center...

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.183
...so when it rotates,
the disc goes up and down...

01:01:15.263 --> 01:01:20.054
...and subsequently the arms attached to
that disc go up and down, moving cables...

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:22.325
...which move the tentacles.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.158
I didn't understand any of that.

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:32.199
Hi, what'll it be?

01:01:32.279 --> 01:01:35.669
Large pepperoni pizza and a pitcher of diet.

01:01:35.749 --> 01:01:38.218
And a strawberry milkshake.

01:01:38.298 --> 01:01:40.385
Okay, I'll be back in a flash.

01:01:43.391 --> 01:01:46.851
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:02:07.582 --> 01:02:09.792
He is really well-behaved this evening.

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:30.025
You didn't talk me into that one.

01:02:30.855 --> 01:02:34.904
I just did it and I don't know why.

01:02:35.515 --> 01:02:37.830
I knew you'd come around eventually.

01:02:39.414 --> 01:02:41.236
What happened?

01:02:42.116 --> 01:02:46.574
You've developed immunities,
so you're upping your dosage.

01:02:47.387 --> 01:02:48.961
Why?

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.260
You're addicted.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.214
Stop killing and sobriety's
icy hand will have you.

01:02:56.596 --> 01:02:59.454
Hell, you can't even decrease your kills...

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:03.688
...but any increase and you overdose.

01:03:04.138 --> 01:03:06.962
So, what do I do?

01:03:07.842 --> 01:03:10.697
You graduate to stronger shit.

01:03:10.777 --> 01:03:13.533
You have to kill those close to you now.

01:03:13.613 --> 01:03:16.564
Friends, family...

01:03:16.644 --> 01:03:19.328
...you have to kill more people like Susan.

01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:23.844
I think you're tricking me.

01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:28.148
I think you had this planned all along.

01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:31.251
You say everyone else is tricking me...

01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:33.388
...but it's you.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:36.598
I know that now, so...

01:03:36.678 --> 01:03:39.593
...you can't trick me anymore.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:45.132
You're still gonna have to do everything
I say, because I control your dreams.

01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:48.268
I can handle the nightmares.

01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:50.337
You haven't yet had a nightmare.

01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:53.573
I won't do it.

01:03:53.653 --> 01:03:55.876
You're getting real close.

01:03:55.956 --> 01:03:58.545
I can smell your soul getting ripe.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.281
I won't do it.

01:04:01.361 --> 01:04:05.544
Oh, you'll do it, retard,
or I'll find another retard...

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:07.339
...and he'll do it to you.

01:04:33.994 --> 01:04:35.884
Oh, wow.

01:04:37.364 --> 01:04:39.454
Hi, Susan.

01:04:40.384 --> 01:04:42.671
You got me really good.

01:04:44.404 --> 01:04:45.845
Car?

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:48.195
Hit me right here first...

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.610
...and then up here.

01:04:53.713 --> 01:04:56.743
You can't even really see a bruise, can you?

01:05:05.159 --> 01:05:07.389
My skin held up pretty well.

01:05:08.628 --> 01:05:12.489
Even after the bus sent me
through the windshield.

01:05:13.133 --> 01:05:15.656
You'd think I'd be cut, but I'm not.

01:05:16.636 --> 01:05:18.251
My skin...

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:23.364
...is good.

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:28.218
There's not a mark anywhere on it.

01:05:28.298 --> 01:05:30.929
And most of my bones aren't broken either.

01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:37.545
You know that saying, "a chain is
only as strong as its weakest link"?

01:05:38.425 --> 01:05:41.381
Well, you can see that my skin
isn't the weakest link.

01:05:41.461 --> 01:05:43.315
My bones aren't either.

01:05:44.498 --> 01:05:45.872
What is?

01:05:47.635 --> 01:05:51.925
Absolutely everything else.

01:05:52.306 --> 01:05:56.166
You can see now, Dennis, that my skin...

01:05:57.645 --> 01:06:01.505
...is the only thing
that's holding me together.

01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:19.323
Hey, you nod off there, buddy?

01:06:21.635 --> 01:06:24.255
Well, I guess you've had
enough fun for one night.

01:06:24.338 --> 01:06:26.208
Come on, we'll take you home.

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:41.007
You can't hurt me if I don't fall asleep.

01:06:41.087 --> 01:06:44.050
You know what happens
if you stay awake too long?

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.797
I don't care.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:49.549
You reach a state of semi-consciousness...

01:06:49.629 --> 01:06:52.637
...unable to discern asleep from awake.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:58.492
You know what happens if you stay
in the dark place long enough?

01:06:58.572 --> 01:07:01.128
You get really ugly.

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:04.398
You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:27.053
How can you stay awake all night?

01:07:27.133 --> 01:07:29.403
You won't last an hour.

01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:43.111
Nighty night.

01:07:48.488 --> 01:07:51.671
<i>This just in... sleep.</i>

01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:54.300
<i>Let yourself sleep.</i>

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.916
<i>Sleep.</i>

01:07:59.765 --> 01:08:01.268
<i>Sleep.</i>

01:08:28.763 --> 01:08:32.252
- You still up?
- Nope, I just woke up.

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:35.194
Glad to hear you got some sleep. Whew!

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:39.158
You are ripe. You need a bath.
Let's go run one.

01:08:39.238 --> 01:08:43.430
I know. I get to call the shots
today and I say no bath.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:46.371
Yes, that was yesterday. Run a bath.

01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:53.054
Today. Chop, chop.

01:09:04.231 --> 01:09:06.326
Wake up, honey. We overslept.

01:09:10.036 --> 01:09:13.393
What are you talking about? You went
to go check on Dennis five minutes ago.

01:09:13.473 --> 01:09:15.363
No, I didn't.

01:09:16.143 --> 01:09:18.131
You didn't?

01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:19.770
No.

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:24.971
You didn't tell him to take a bath?

01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:26.582
No.

01:09:28.823 --> 01:09:30.773
That's weird, I must have dreamt it.

01:09:37.497 --> 01:09:40.220
- I got the "morning afters."
- Yeah.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.991
- Morning after crack and gasoline.
- What the hell did we drink last night?

01:09:44.071 --> 01:09:46.336
We didn't.
We didn't drink anything last night.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.856
Let's get some coffee at the ice cream place.

01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:10.518
- Hey, Susan, do you still...
- That's not Susan, honey.

01:10:10.598 --> 01:10:14.121
Sorry, ma'am, I'm just so used to seeing
Susan here. You look so much like her.

01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:17.391
People have made that mistake
tons of times before.

01:10:17.471 --> 01:10:20.694
- You'll be seeing me here from now on.
- Where is Susan?

01:10:20.774 --> 01:10:23.062
- I'm sorry, you haven't heard?
- No.

01:10:23.142 --> 01:10:26.466
- She had an accident.
- What kind of accident?

01:10:26.546 --> 01:10:30.636
A traffic accident, kind of.
She got hit by a car.

01:10:30.717 --> 01:10:33.641
- Oh, my God.
- Well, how is she doing?

01:10:33.871 --> 01:10:35.591
She's dead.

01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:41.715
- Oh, honey, here she comes.
- Good. Ma'am.

01:10:41.795 --> 01:10:45.032
- Miss.
- Ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.157
- Wow.
- Sir? Sir? Could you send...

01:10:50.837 --> 01:10:52.677
Thank you.

01:10:55.475 --> 01:10:57.290
What would you like?

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:01.969
- Uh, I want a drink. You?
- Definitely.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:06.640
- Vodka, soda, splash of pineapple, please.
- And I will have a Jack, neat.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.144
And what happened to the usual waitress?
What's her name, Jenny?

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:13.285
I'm filling in for her.
She's sick or something.

01:11:15.929 --> 01:11:18.919
Hostess, valet, waitress...

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:20.854
...it's beginning to seem like an epidemic.

01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:22.804
No kidding.

01:11:29.009 --> 01:11:31.691
Totally forgot my appointment
with Dr. Preston.

01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:34.011
At least I'll see one familiar face today.

01:11:35.615 --> 01:11:37.432
Excuse me, Dr. Preston?

01:11:38.652 --> 01:11:42.822
- I am, uh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks fucking Christ for that.

01:11:44.424 --> 01:11:48.712
I'm in the mood to vent,
and you caught me at a hell of a time.

01:11:49.262 --> 01:11:51.351
Go ahead, ask me the question.

01:11:51.431 --> 01:11:55.427
Ask me what everyone fucking asks me,
every fucking minute of every fucking day.

01:11:55.507 --> 01:11:58.007
"Why do you look like that?
What's wrong with you?"

01:11:58.087 --> 01:12:00.427
You wanna know what's wrong with me?

01:12:00.507 --> 01:12:02.799
Nothing. I'm just dandy.

01:12:02.879 --> 01:12:05.532
Until of course some asshole
like you comes along...

01:12:05.612 --> 01:12:09.637
- ...and ruins my damn good time.
- Terribly sorry, sir.

01:12:24.665 --> 01:12:27.192
I need a break.

01:12:28.702 --> 01:12:30.950
After we get Mildy.

01:12:33.759 --> 01:12:36.588
- Who?
- You'll remember when we see her.

01:12:44.217 --> 01:12:45.472
But I don't know.

01:12:45.552 --> 01:12:49.776
She's a bitter social reject who can
never feel good about herself...

01:12:49.856 --> 01:12:53.646
...so to even the playing field
she makes everyone feel bad.

01:12:54.227 --> 01:12:55.863
No!

01:12:55.943 --> 01:13:00.254
What if I say, "No, I won't kill Mildy"?

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.992
I won't kill anyone again.

01:13:03.072 --> 01:13:06.693
She's coming for you now.
She's coming with the police.

01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:08.237
Good.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:11.911
Go too long without killing
and the nightmares start, Dennis.

01:13:11.991 --> 01:13:14.021
I can fix that.

01:13:39.306 --> 01:13:41.966
If I kill me, I kill us.

01:14:05.665 --> 01:14:08.005
How do you like the dark place, Dennis?

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:14.989
You said I'd be happy...

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:17.548
...for the rest of my life.

01:14:18.144 --> 01:14:21.000
You're not alive anymore, Dennis.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.321
I am.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.141
So we're all clear, right?

01:14:37.964 --> 01:14:41.087
John Peterson?
Mildy Torres, Social Services...

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:44.357
...with a court order relieving you
of your custodial responsibilities...

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:46.668
...to Dennis Peterson.

01:14:47.974 --> 01:14:49.496
Looks like nobody's home.

01:14:49.576 --> 01:14:52.365
Yeah, we don't have a search warrant, so...

01:14:52.445 --> 01:14:54.665
So stick to what's in plain sight.

01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:58.480
All right.

01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:05.779
You smell that?

01:15:06.259 --> 01:15:07.981
Retard stink.

01:15:08.061 --> 01:15:10.284
No, it smells good.

01:15:10.864 --> 01:15:13.653
Wait a minute, we're alone here, right?

01:15:13.733 --> 01:15:19.158
Yeah, turkeys, chicken,
roast beef, it all takes a day.

01:15:19.238 --> 01:15:23.096
All right, so I'm going up here,
you're gonna take the kitchen?

01:15:23.176 --> 01:15:25.260
- Just save me a piece, all right, Don?
- Yeah, right.

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.671
I'm serious.

01:15:52.706 --> 01:15:54.566
Did you hear that?

01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:59.393
You better fucking save me a piece.

01:18:19.819 --> 01:18:21.842
I don't recognize a soul.

01:18:22.422 --> 01:18:25.111
It's worse than that.
We haven't recognized anyone all day.

01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:27.047
Where is everyone?

01:18:27.427 --> 01:18:29.783
I don't know. Must be the flu or something.

01:18:29.863 --> 01:18:32.779
- Why would it only target our friends?
- Okay, so what's your guess?

01:18:32.869 --> 01:18:36.323
Dennis is holed up in the basement with
instructions for butchers and taxidermists.

01:18:36.403 --> 01:18:39.659
It smells like Satan's ass down there.
People are missing, one's dead for sure...

01:18:39.739 --> 01:18:42.296
Not everyone we know is missing, okay?

01:18:42.576 --> 01:18:45.466
Ha! There's Pete. Pete from the bookstore.

01:18:46.813 --> 01:18:48.643
Hey, Pete!

01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:55.775
Pete!

01:18:55.855 --> 01:19:00.299
Uh, hi, John, Lydia, what's going on?

01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:03.516
You're a little bit excited
and it's creeping me out, man.

01:19:03.596 --> 01:19:05.685
It's just...
it's just really good to see you.

01:19:06.165 --> 01:19:09.550
- Yeah, super to see you guys.
- No, no.

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:12.726
You don't understand, man. You're the
first familiar face we've seen all day.

01:19:12.806 --> 01:19:16.562
It's just really "Twilight Zone"-ish.

01:19:16.642 --> 01:19:18.232
Okay.

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:24.212
Oh, John, I've got Dennis's
books on tape here.

01:19:25.184 --> 01:19:28.141
Yeah, this is definitely Dennis's.

01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:31.544
I've got Chuck's marked down there
with a different color.

01:19:31.624 --> 01:19:34.200
Have Chuck's and Dennis' books
been getting messed up?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.016
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

01:19:37.096 --> 01:19:40.954
Yes, thank God.
Parting of the Red Sea was okay...

01:19:41.034 --> 01:19:45.659
...but I was not a believer until
I witnessed the bookstore fuck up.

01:19:46.389 --> 01:19:50.697
- Have you seen any of Chuck's cassettes?
- Yeah.

01:19:50.777 --> 01:19:53.266
Because I was a bit worried
they may be Dennis's.

01:19:53.346 --> 01:19:55.581
- Okay, yeah, I got that.
- He's been spending a lot of time...

01:19:55.661 --> 01:19:58.672
...in the basement.
There's weird smells coming out of there.

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:02.208
And stinking in the basement is okay
if you're reading the right books.

01:20:02.288 --> 01:20:04.077
Exactly.

01:20:04.157 --> 01:20:06.613
Well, there you have it.

01:20:07.293 --> 01:20:08.376
What?

01:20:08.456 --> 01:20:11.332
Well, Dennis didn't even
buy the books, Chuck did.

01:20:11.797 --> 01:20:13.687
Your point?

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:17.056
Your theory about Dennis
no longer has a leg to stand on.

01:20:17.636 --> 01:20:20.660
Well, then, why do you lie about him so much?

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.509
- What are you hiding?
- What?

01:20:24.409 --> 01:20:26.165
Why are you lying?

01:20:26.245 --> 01:20:28.057
I'm not lying.

01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:39.627
We both know you're lying.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:47.291
You really wanna know?

01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:50.657
Dennis was a prodigy.

01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:53.727
His IQ is not traditionally measurable.

01:20:54.537 --> 01:20:56.779
Taught himself arithmetic through...

01:20:56.859 --> 01:21:00.334
...long division at age five, library books.

01:21:01.214 --> 01:21:03.484
He was a hero in the papers and...

01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:07.614
...still a hero to Dr. Preston. He keeps...

01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:11.186
...a display case of newspaper clippings,
essays, novellas, theories...

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:14.733
...all about or by Dennis.

01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:19.218
- What happened?
- I don't remember all of it.

01:21:19.698 --> 01:21:23.756
I was eight when he was six
and we got into a fight...

01:21:23.836 --> 01:21:27.304
...and I punched him, good punch,
knockout punch right to the jaw.

01:21:30.944 --> 01:21:32.818
And he went...

01:21:33.509 --> 01:21:35.548
...tumbling down the stairs.

01:21:35.815 --> 01:21:38.105
He was only unconscious for about an hour...

01:21:40.086 --> 01:21:43.402
...but, uh, when he came to...

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:47.301
...he couldn't read. He couldn't
even tie his own shoelaces.

01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:52.186
Christ, I don't know.

01:21:53.766 --> 01:21:55.996
I don't even know what the fight was about.

01:21:58.654 --> 01:22:00.547
You did this to him.

01:22:06.562 --> 01:22:08.282
He was a genius?

01:22:11.234 --> 01:22:13.490
Christ, I'd love to get away with you.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.030
Start a family, have a normal life...

01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:21.598
...but I really do owe
every cent that I make...

01:22:21.678 --> 01:22:24.702
...and every moment of my life to Dennis.

01:22:25.832 --> 01:22:27.854
We're gonna have to talk to Dennis.

01:22:28.484 --> 01:22:30.539
About what?

01:22:30.819 --> 01:22:32.936
He'll need to know
how things are going to change.

01:22:33.016 --> 01:22:34.811
What's going to change?

01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:38.691
For one, that house is going to be
a little more cramped with me living in it.

01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:40.546
You could live with Dennis?

01:22:40.626 --> 01:22:43.111
Well, it's not a dream come true...

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:45.981
...but it is a family.

01:22:46.635 --> 01:22:48.524
And that's more than I ever had.

01:22:49.104 --> 01:22:51.727
Wait, wait, I'm sorry, where are you going?

01:22:51.807 --> 01:22:53.762
I'm gonna go get Dennis.

01:22:53.842 --> 01:22:57.600
Get the birthday table at Monsoon's.
He's gonna have a lot to digest.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.005
A lot of complicated grown-up issues...

01:23:02.085 --> 01:23:04.745
...and pizza to digest.

01:23:21.204 --> 01:23:24.093
So, how about them Dodgers?

01:23:26.573 --> 01:23:28.437
I'm sorry, Pete.

01:23:29.212 --> 01:23:32.201
I'm sorry to everyone, I seem
to have made a bit of a spectacle.

01:23:32.281 --> 01:23:35.905
No, no, dude. None of us even noticed.

01:23:36.785 --> 01:23:42.075
Let me just put Dennis' books
there on the edge of your table.

01:23:48.797 --> 01:23:52.789
- You look a bit glazy, man.
- Yeah, I feel a bit weird.

01:23:52.869 --> 01:23:56.059
- You take anything, man?
- Just prescription stuff.

01:23:56.139 --> 01:24:00.063
Well, let's not jump to conclusions
and blame the drugs.

01:24:00.143 --> 01:24:03.599
Anybody would freak when they found out
what Dennis has been reading about.

01:24:03.679 --> 01:24:06.069
I haven't yet found out what Dennis
has been reading about.

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:11.054
- I know what Chuck's been reading.
- Oh, yeah, now, that's creepy.

01:24:11.134 --> 01:24:13.242
Why? What has Dennis been reading?

01:24:13.322 --> 01:24:16.460
Books on forensics and taxidermy.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:20.017
- That's... that's Chuck.
- No, that's Dennis.

01:24:21.397 --> 01:24:23.452
It's an acquired taste.

01:24:24.182 --> 01:24:28.080
Don't worry about that smell
in your basement, it's dead animals.

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:31.826
Taxi!

01:24:32.107 --> 01:24:35.030
- Pete, you gotta call the cops.
- I don't want to.

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:38.765
Send them to my house.
There's a crime in progress.

01:24:40.884 --> 01:24:42.454
Dennis!

01:24:48.725 --> 01:24:50.271
Denn...

01:25:43.479 --> 01:25:46.453
Here's the knife, alakazam...

01:25:47.513 --> 01:25:49.874
...gone. Boo.

01:27:12.752 --> 01:27:14.590
Gesundheit.

01:28:47.095 --> 01:28:48.615
Dennis?

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.836
Good evening.

01:29:06.916 --> 01:29:08.455
Lydia?

01:29:09.385 --> 01:29:11.305
Say hello to John.

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:13.409
Hello, John.

01:29:13.789 --> 01:29:17.713
Lydia, you seem a little sad.
Is something wrong?

01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:20.866
Yes, I feel all empty inside.

01:29:20.946 --> 01:29:23.660
I'm a shell of my former self.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.821
Why are you feeling that way?

01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:30.326
I've demanded so much of my brother's
time that he no longer has a life.

01:29:30.406 --> 01:29:34.556
I can't care for myself,
so duty binds him to me.

01:29:34.637 --> 01:29:37.032
And you feel guilty because of that?

01:29:37.112 --> 01:29:40.035
I took all the time he could
have focused on his own needs...

01:29:40.115 --> 01:29:42.605
...and demanded he focus on my needs.

01:29:42.685 --> 01:29:44.491
I took his life away.

01:29:45.821 --> 01:29:48.110
Oh, it can't be that bad.

01:29:48.190 --> 01:29:50.243
What could be worse?

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:53.568
You could remove any hope
of his having a normal life.

01:29:55.197 --> 01:29:56.755
How?

01:29:56.835 --> 01:30:00.655
Well, you could push him down
the stairs and damage his brain.

01:30:00.736 --> 01:30:03.125
Render him mentally incompetent.

01:30:03.205 --> 01:30:06.595
What kind of a monster
would do that to his own family?

01:30:06.675 --> 01:30:09.598
- A spider.
- What do spiders do?

01:30:09.678 --> 01:30:12.368
They kill all their family members.

01:30:13.548 --> 01:30:15.438
That's not as bad as what I did.

01:30:15.518 --> 01:30:19.575
And what you did isn't as bad
as damaging someone's brain.

01:30:19.655 --> 01:30:21.644
Oh? Why not?

01:30:21.724 --> 01:30:24.547
When you damage someone's brain
you darken their whole world.

01:30:24.627 --> 01:30:26.829
Dennis. Dennis, what are you doing?

01:30:26.909 --> 01:30:31.434
Nothing remains familiar.
Family loses familiarity.

01:30:31.834 --> 01:30:34.089
- Dennis, get me out of the chair.
- Imagine that.

01:30:34.169 --> 01:30:35.458
Imagine what?

01:30:35.538 --> 01:30:38.794
How it must feel to wander
about a town once familiar...

01:30:38.874 --> 01:30:42.431
...only to meet fifth generation copies
of people you once knew.

01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:45.348
How could someone in that position cope?

01:30:45.648 --> 01:30:50.476
- He'd have to think like a spider.
- Dennis, Dennis, Dennis...

01:30:50.556 --> 01:30:52.608
...everything is gonna be fine.

01:30:52.688 --> 01:30:56.113
A spider's so cold and deceptive.

01:30:57.393 --> 01:30:59.248
Oh, Christ.

01:30:59.928 --> 01:31:04.587
Dennis, Dennis. Dennis. Dennis!
Dennis! Let me out of the chair!

01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:08.757
Dennis, goddamnit!
Let me out of the chair! Right now!

01:31:08.837 --> 01:31:10.609
Everyone is.

01:31:10.839 --> 01:31:15.900
Dennis, listen to me! Goddamnit,
Dennis, let me out of the chair!

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.104
Let me tell you a story
about a worse deception still.

01:31:23.136 --> 01:31:28.110
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

01:31:28.190 --> 01:31:32.818
If I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

01:31:32.898 --> 01:31:36.291
And I pray the Lord forgive me,
but he cannot stay.

01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:40.055
He takes attention I need from my Mommy away.

01:31:40.135 --> 01:31:43.081
He reminds me all the time that I'm not him.

01:31:43.488 --> 01:31:47.718
Forgive me, oh, Lord, but I'm about to sin.

01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:00.325
These injuries could not have
happened in the fall.

01:32:00.405 --> 01:32:02.761
Ah-ha! The jealous older brother.

01:32:02.841 --> 01:32:06.999
He's the victim of an attack.
I'll revive him, he'll talk.

01:32:07.079 --> 01:32:10.075
Talk to me, boy. Beautiful, beautiful boy.

01:32:10.155 --> 01:32:14.340
- Goddammit, Dennis! Get me out of this chair.
- Foiled! No, not foiled, just a setback.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.128
We'll bring you back.
And your brother will get his comeuppance.

01:32:19.758 --> 01:32:22.381
Everyone is deceiving everyone.

01:32:22.861 --> 01:32:26.552
We're not social animals, it's a rogue world.

01:32:27.332 --> 01:32:29.087
A spider world.

01:32:29.167 --> 01:32:33.892
<i># The itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the water spout #</i>

01:32:33.972 --> 01:32:38.173
<i># Down came the rain,
and washed the spider out ##</i>

01:32:59.332 --> 01:33:01.416
Dennis! Let me out of the chair!

01:33:01.496 --> 01:33:03.797
Dennis! Dennis!

01:34:10.032 --> 01:34:13.005
<i>The doctors tell me
if I received orders to kill...</i>

01:34:13.085 --> 01:34:16.161
<i>...from the person who made up my dreams...</i>

01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:18.663
<i>...and the person I saw in the mirror...</i>

01:34:18.743 --> 01:34:21.767
<i>...then I ordered myself to kill.</i>

01:34:21.847 --> 01:34:24.937
<i>I am simply insane.</i>

01:34:25.417 --> 01:34:28.741
<i>None of this is real, but that isn't true.</i>

01:34:28.821 --> 01:34:32.891
<i>I'm not in this hospital. This isn't me.</i>

01:34:43.235 --> 01:34:45.390
<i>I'm in this hospital...</i>

01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:47.393
<i>...this is me.</i>

01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:49.506
<i>All I do now is hope...</i>

01:34:49.586 --> 01:34:54.166
<i>...hope that the cheap electric car
will come crashing through the doors.</i>

01:34:54.246 --> 01:34:56.534
<i>I'll be safely back at the carnival...</i>

01:34:56.614 --> 01:34:59.872
<i>...and the scariest haunted house
in the world...</i>

01:34:59.952 --> 01:35:03.175
<i>...will finally come to an end.</i>

01:35:04.305 --> 01:35:10.675
