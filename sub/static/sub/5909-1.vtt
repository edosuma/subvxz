00:35.068 --> 00:39.630
Young people from all over the globe
are joining up to fight for the future.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.402
I'm doing my part.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.144
I'm doing my part too.

00:48.014 --> 00:50.209
They're doing their part. Are you?

00:50.283 --> 00:52.774
Join the Mobile Infantry
and save the world.

00:52.852 --> 00:56.253
Service guarantees citizenship.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.361
The Bugs send
another meteor our way.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.294
But this time we 're ready.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.832
Planetary defenses
are better than ever.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.963
Klendathu, source of the Bug attacks...

01:15.041 --> 01:16.975
orbits a twin-star system whose...

01:17.043 --> 01:21.537
gravitational forces produce an
unlimited supply of Bug meteorites...

01:21.614 --> 01:24.344
in the form of this asteroid belt.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.578
To ensure our safety...

01:26.653 --> 01:28.917
Klendathu must be eliminated.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.452
We break net now and take you live...

01:32.525 --> 01:36.325
to Klendathu,
where the invasion has begun.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.194
DXQ uplink on.
Two, one, you're on!

01:39.265 --> 01:42.393
We've landed on what Cap Troopers....

01:42.469 --> 01:47.270
are calling Big "K", with the
Sixth Mobile Infantry division.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.707
It's an ugly, Bug planet.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.678
A planet hostile
to life as we know it.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.283
Help me!

02:07.660 --> 02:11.323
- Die! Die!
- Come on! Go!

02:11.397 --> 02:13.661
- Keep moving.
- Get out of here now!

02:35.321 --> 02:36.754
Oh, God!

02:53.907 --> 02:55.033
Rico.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.116
Pay attention.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.852
Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.356
Let's sum up.
This year we explored...

03:10.423 --> 03:13.722
the failure of Democracy, how the
social scientists brought our world...

03:13.793 --> 03:15.624
to the brink of chaos.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.562
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control...

03:18.631 --> 03:23.466
and imposed the stability that
has lasted for generations since.

03:23.536 --> 03:28.872
You know these facts. But have
I taught you anything of value?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.910
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

03:30.977 --> 03:34.208
It's a reward.
What the Federation gives you...

03:34.280 --> 03:39.377
- for doing federal service.
- No. No! Something given....

03:39.452 --> 03:41.716
has no value.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.621
When you vote you are exercising
political authority.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.386
You're using force.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.689
Force, my friends, is violence.

03:48.761 --> 03:52.561
The supreme authority for which
all other authority is derived.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.668
My mother says violence
never solves anything.

03:55.735 --> 04:00.798
Really? I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.841
You.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.934
They probably wouldn't
say anything.

04:05.011 --> 04:08.139
- Hiroshima was destroyed.
- Correct.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.341
Naked force has
resolved more issues...

04:10.416 --> 04:12.941
throughout history
than any other factor.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.920
The contrary opinion that
violence never solves anything...

04:15.989 --> 04:19.447
is wishful thinking
at its worst.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.857
People who forget
that always pay.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.864
What's the moral difference,
if any...

04:25.932 --> 04:27.866
between a civilian
and a citizen?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.994
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety....

04:31.070 --> 04:34.437
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.

04:34.507 --> 04:38.534
- A civilian does not.
- Exact words of the text.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.478
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?

04:42.682 --> 04:44.115
I don't know.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.549
Of course you don't.
I doubt anyone here....

04:46.619 --> 04:49.816
would recognize civic virtue
if it bit you in the ass!

05:07.707 --> 05:09.675
Not here.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.767
Come on. Let's see if
they posted the math final.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.211
- We gonna take Tesla?
- We're gonna kill 'em.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.447
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your math scores.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.956
Wish me luck.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.424
Way to go.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.296
Good job.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.427
Your turn. Hold on.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.336
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.739
- Hi, Carmen.
- What'd you hear about Roxy?

05:43.810 --> 05:45.243
She made pilot.

05:47.747 --> 05:50.341
Thirty-five percent. Very nice.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.210
Look at that.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.721
Thirty- five percent,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.485
- Big numbers.
- Carl.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.491
Sorry.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.591
So you haven't done it yet?
Don't lie.

06:09.669 --> 06:13.833
- I'm not in any hurry.
- Others are waiting.

06:16.109 --> 06:20.705
- Did you read her mind?
- Don't have to. I know what she wants.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.714
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

06:22.782 --> 06:26.445
Aw, you got it bad. Hey, don't
forget about this afternoon.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.249
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.290
Get out of here.

06:31.357 --> 06:34.520
- Marco's sister made pilot!
- So will you.

06:34.594 --> 06:38.428
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.432
You gotta have nerves of steel.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.402
- You do. Let's see how yours hold up.
- You may begin!

06:56.182 --> 06:58.412
Oh, come on. It's just a Bug.
Better put your goggles on.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.974
Just a Bug. Ha!

07:00.052 --> 07:04.011
We humans like to think we are
nature's finest achievement.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.422
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

07:06.492 --> 07:11.429
This Arkellian Sand Beetle
is superior in many ways.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.591
It reproduces in vast numbers...

07:14.667 --> 07:17.830
has no ego, has no fear...

07:17.904 --> 07:19.895
doesn't know about death...

07:19.972 --> 07:23.908
and, so, is the perfect,
selfless member of society.

07:23.976 --> 07:28.003
But humans have created art,
mathematics, and interstellar travel.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.183
True, but before you
let that go to your head...

07:32.251 --> 07:34.116
take the example
of the Arachnids...

07:34.187 --> 07:38.021
a highly evolved
insect society.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.116
By human standards
they are relatively stupid....

07:41.194 --> 07:45.324
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.827
- And now...
- Take this.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.300
They can colonize planets...

07:50.369 --> 07:53.270
by hurling their spore
into space.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.034
Yeah, I think we got it.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.540
There's the heart....

07:58.678 --> 08:01.909
and here's the stomach.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.186
Nerves of steel. Huh?

08:11.991 --> 08:15.324
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.328
Try to visualize it.

08:31.644 --> 08:35.171
I see the ace of spades.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.754
Statistically speaking, you should have
accidentally guessed right by now.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.255
Try another.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.588
So, my psychic abilities
are zero and I'm unlucky.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.787
No, luck's not a factor.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.023
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.966
Who knows? Maybe it's a
new stage of human evolution.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.232
That's why they do
these kind of Federal studies.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.933
Cyrano! Ah, shit. Time out.

09:02.008 --> 09:05.102
Aw, he just wants some attention.
You don't play with him anymore.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.715
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.660
How do you make him do that?

09:22.728 --> 09:26.858
I gave him the impression there's
a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.401
He's on a mission
to go eat it.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.958
Get off my leg!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.502
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.843
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.541
Yet.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.091
All right!

10:01.701 --> 10:03.498
Touchdown, Tigers.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.503
The score is now 41 to 38.

10:05.571 --> 10:10.304
Tigers lead with 2:46 remaining here
at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.970
- Time out: Giants.
- Are you all right?

10:13.045 --> 10:16.446
- Much better now.
- Good.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.176
Hey! Your helmet!

10:22.755 --> 10:24.689
So, what are you doing
after the game?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.392
Everyone's going to the dance.
Aren't you?

10:29.462 --> 10:33.159
- It's my last night as a civilian.
- Number 12, let's go!

10:33.232 --> 10:36.633
- Ship off to Tereshkova tomorrow.
- You're going to the Fleet Academy?

10:38.604 --> 10:43.007
- That's where I want to go!
- Come on, number 12! Let's play ball.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.542
Don't get any ideas
about my girlfriend!

10:48.447 --> 10:50.574
All is fair
in love and war.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.048
- Giants! Giants!
- Johnny! Yeah!

11:11.671 --> 11:14.037
Just under 22 seconds remaining.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.869
All right, let's go.
Irving, Latham, cover the rook.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.972
Perry, fake left.
Ricoli, you go long.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.644
Rico, flip six, three hole.
Got it?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.879
- Hey!
- What?

11:30.956 --> 11:34.517
You're drifting! Flip six,
three hole on one. Got it?

11:34.593 --> 11:36.458
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.928
Ready? Break!

11:40.599 --> 11:42.726
Two! Six!

11:42.802 --> 11:44.736
- Climb left!
- Screen!

11:59.251 --> 12:00.878
Go, go, go!

12:03.189 --> 12:04.383
All right!

12:10.796 --> 12:13.321
He's in there! It's over!

12:29.348 --> 12:31.612
Who said you could
grow up so fast?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.618
Mom, don't get mushy.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.581
This came for you today.
I presume, at your request.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.523
A lot of my friends
are doing Federal Service.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.089
Well, you 're not
thinking of applying?

12:48.167 --> 12:50.158
Have you
lost your mind?

12:50.236 --> 12:53.603
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.

12:53.672 --> 12:57.108
It's a term of service.
It's not a career.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.408
I just want
to get out on my own...

13:01.480 --> 13:03.948
see the galaxy
for a couple of years.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.541
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.282
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?

13:10.356 --> 13:13.655
What's his name? You know
the one I'm talking about.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.190
Silly name.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.065
There should be a law against using
a school as a recruiting station.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.571
Rasczak doesn't
do that at all.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.700
He sort of discourages you.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.641
Well, that's good...

13:32.711 --> 13:35.236
'cause you're going to Harvard
and that's the end of it.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.475
It's my decision, not yours.

13:37.550 --> 13:41.577
- Oh, is that how it is?
- Wait, you two.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.851
Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.017
Can you guess what it is?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.496
You wanted
to see the galaxy?

13:52.631 --> 13:55.657
How about a trip
to the Outer Rings?

13:55.734 --> 13:58.760
Zegema Beach. Huh?

14:01.273 --> 14:04.265
- I've always wanted to go there.
- Good. Then it's all settled.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.952
Sure. Don't go away.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.555
I'm just gonna
go see Mr. Rasczak.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.928
Hey, Rico.
You wanna dance?

14:31.003 --> 14:32.561
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen...

14:32.638 --> 14:35.038
Aw. Come on. Too bad for her
if she's not around.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.311
It's sad...
after tonight, most of us...

14:41.380 --> 14:44.110
probably won't
see each other again.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.813
So, you still gonna
play for Rio?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.988
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.617
Well, anyone who gets you
is lucky.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.726
Johnny, how come
we never got together?

15:03.702 --> 15:05.636
Can't we
just be friends, Diz?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.739
Sure.

15:15.381 --> 15:19.147
Look, Diz, I want
to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.919
Well, you'd better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.422
You're the best.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.866
What is it, Rico?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.900
I want to thank you. Your class
was the best one I had this year.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.845
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.315
I want to join up. I think I got
what it takes to be a citizen.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.852
Good for you.
Go find out.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.412
Well, my parents are against it.
I know it's my choice.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.823
I was wondering. What would
you do if you were me?

16:02.861 --> 16:06.456
Figuring things out for yourself is
the only freedom anyone really has.

16:06.532 --> 16:10.366
Use that freedom.
Make up your own mind, Rico.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.004
But I have not been
to paradise

16:22.081 --> 16:27.041
No, I have not been
to paradise

16:27.119 --> 16:29.952
Watch the days go by

16:30.022 --> 16:31.990
All is well

16:32.057 --> 16:34.582
Don't exaggerate.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.254
You have really
beautiful eyes.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.496
This is Zander.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.662
We know each other
from the game.

16:46.739 --> 16:51.335
- No hard feelings?
- Oh, none at all. We won.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.877
Come on, Carmen.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.311
It's the last dance.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.748
- Maybe I'll see you at the Academy.
- Yeah. Who knows?

17:00.152 --> 17:01.847
Good luck.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.887
Zander's going for pilot too.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.950
You two have
so much in common.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.553
Are you jealous?

17:12.631 --> 17:15.292
Well, maybe.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.300
You don't have to be jealous.

17:17.368 --> 17:21.532
No, I have not been to paradise

17:22.608 --> 17:25.667
Break it up, you two.
There's a place for that sort of thing.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.776
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.785
I'm gonna go
for Federal Service.

17:34.853 --> 17:40.155
That's great! Carl and I are
signing up tomorrow. Come with us.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.817
I will.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.556
Talk about

17:44.630 --> 17:47.463
Watch the days go by

17:47.533 --> 17:49.660
My father's not home tonight.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.036
All is well

18:08.787 --> 18:11.255
Twenty-third century dies

18:12.758 --> 18:14.726
Of my own free will...

18:14.793 --> 18:18.251
after having been duly
advised and warned...

18:18.330 --> 18:21.663
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath....

18:21.733 --> 18:26.227
enroll in the Federal Service
for not less than two years....

18:26.305 --> 18:31.641
and as much longer as may be required
by the needs of the Federation.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.511
Fresh meat
for the grinder, eh?

18:43.122 --> 18:46.956
- So, how'd you kids do?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.

18:47.025 --> 18:51.052
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.691
- Hey, did you get Starside R& D?
- No.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.894
- I don't believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.

18:59.238 --> 19:03.140
Games and Theory?
That's Military Intelligence.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.371
Way to go, Carl.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.175
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.075
What about you, son?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.986
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.

19:17.055 --> 19:21.321
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.988
All recruits report to
the Federal Transportation Hub...

19:25.063 --> 19:26.826
within 24 hours.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.424
Welcome to the adventure
of Federal Service.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.833
Let's make a vow.

19:31.904 --> 19:35.203
No matter what.
We'll always be friends.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.840
I'll go for that.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.380
Well, chances are we'll
never see each other again.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.149
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.779
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.859
You'll resign.
That's all there is to it!

19:54.927 --> 19:57.122
It may look bad, but if that's the
worst you suffer, then that's fine.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.165
- I won't quit.
- I'm telling you, you will.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.291
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

20:02.367 --> 20:06.201
I am not going on vacation!
I want to be a citizen.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.762
- It's my decision.
- You walk out that door....

20:08.840 --> 20:10.637
you are cut off,
young man, understand?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.911
All right! That's it!
You are cut off!

20:13.979 --> 20:15.708
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?

20:15.781 --> 20:18.909
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?

20:18.984 --> 20:21.111
Well, yeah. Sure.

20:21.186 --> 20:23.154
I hope so.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.747
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl....

20:25.824 --> 20:28.452
who wants to look handsome
in a uniform.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.995
Don't talk about
Carmen that way!

20:31.063 --> 20:34.590
Your attention, please.
Outbound troops 13-A...

20:37.269 --> 20:39.169
Do you have everything?
Great.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.975
- You're late.
- My dad h ad to help me pack.

20:52.050 --> 20:55.213
Suddenly, he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.482
It was sweet,
but it took forever.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.785
Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
$"Welcome To Federal Transport Hub 39"

21:02.861 --> 21:05.295
Yeah, me too.
I'm wearing everything I own.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.132
I'm sorry
your parents were mad.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.370
Who cares? The Federation'll
give me everything I need for....

21:13.438 --> 21:15.531
the next two years, right?

21:16.475 --> 21:17.840
You talk to Carl?

21:17.909 --> 21:22.312
Yeah, he left this morning.
Couldn't say where.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.212
Oh, it's exciting going away.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.945
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.058
I'm gonna miss you.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.726
I'm gonna miss you too.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.863
I love you.

21:39.931 --> 21:43.833
Outbound group 94-A, Tereshkova,
all sections...

21:43.902 --> 21:45.369
That's me.

21:47.906 --> 21:52.002
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.047
I love you.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.653
- Don't forget to write.
- I won't.

22:24.309 --> 22:27.005
N"A World That Works"
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.309
- Me! Me!
- Citizen rule.

22:29.381 --> 22:32.282
People making
a better tomorrow.

22:40.759 --> 22:44.195
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.752
Guilty.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.894
Sentence: Death.
Execution: Tonight at 6:00.

22:50.969 --> 22:54.200
All net, all channels.
Would you like to know more?

23:00.679 --> 23:03.580
If you think you're psychic....

23:03.648 --> 23:05.081
maybe you are.

23:07.085 --> 23:10.316
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.

23:13.325 --> 23:17.091
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.

23:23.135 --> 23:26.901
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...

23:26.972 --> 23:30.430
and established Port Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

23:30.509 --> 23:34.775
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists...

23:34.846 --> 23:36.507
Arachnids.

23:45.056 --> 23:47.854
- One, two, three, four!
- Most of you will not live...

23:47.926 --> 23:50.827
to be in the Mobile Infantry.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.296
The trouble is, you are not
good enough the way you are.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.595
Hands at your side!

23:55.667 --> 24:00.127
Chin up! I am your senior drill
instructor, Career Sergeant Zim.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.469
Suck in that gut!

24:02.541 --> 24:04.270
Feet together!

24:05.577 --> 24:09.536
To think this had to happen
to me. What a bunch of apes.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.912
No, strike that!
You don't rate that good!

24:11.983 --> 24:14.144
Never in my life have I seen...

24:16.822 --> 24:18.483
Do you think I'm funny?

24:18.557 --> 24:20.047
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think...

24:20.125 --> 24:21.786
- I'm a comedian, son?
- I'm sorry.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.990
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be "sir''!

24:26.064 --> 24:28.225
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

24:28.300 --> 24:30.768
See that armory?
Run around it!

24:30.836 --> 24:33.236
Run, I said!

24:33.305 --> 24:35.170
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move!

24:35.240 --> 24:37.868
Now, any time you think
I'm being too tough...

24:37.943 --> 24:39.877
any time you think
I'm being unfair....

24:39.945 --> 24:43.403
any time you miss
your mommy, quit!

24:43.482 --> 24:48.510
Sign form 1240-A, grab your gear
and take a stroll down Washout Lane.

24:48.587 --> 24:51.750
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

24:51.823 --> 24:56.522
Pathetic! I wonder if there's a handful
of guts in the whole bunch of you.

24:56.595 --> 24:58.460
Now...

24:58.530 --> 25:01.499
who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

25:01.566 --> 25:05.093
Sir, I guess
maybe I do, sir!

25:19.351 --> 25:22.514
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!

25:22.587 --> 25:25.715
It's my arm.
I reckon it's broken, sir.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.087
Medic!

25:28.827 --> 25:31.125
Pain is in your mind!

25:31.196 --> 25:33.994
- Who's next?
- Sir.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.795
Recruit Flores
reporting for duty, sir.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.779
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

25:49.848 --> 25:53.306
- Sir, I heard it was the best, sir!
- It is the best.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.855
But what makes you think
you're good enough?

26:04.663 --> 26:06.722
Now, that's the kind of gal
who makes squad leader,

26:06.798 --> 26:09.130
That's my job
you're talking about.

26:36.194 --> 26:38.185
You know, I'd like to kill
that Sergeant Zim.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.790
Whoa! Improper attitude! They'll
kick you out for talking like that.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.994
Bye-bye. There you go,
down Washout Lane.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.504
Yup. Either you got
what it takes, or you don't.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.699
- Hey, there is a line!
- Wait your turn, Ace.

26:49.774 --> 26:53.540
Hey. At ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.307
Get in line
like everyone else.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.791
You got some guts
for a rich kid.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.884
I guess you and me
could be buddies.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.361
What do ya say?

27:12.430 --> 27:14.022
I'm honored.

27:14.099 --> 27:17.865
Of course you are! Everybody
should have a friend like me.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.870
Come on, Ace!
Back of the line. Man.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.234
- What a jerk, man.
- Tough guy.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.369
Hey, Rico.
Want to sit together?

27:27.445 --> 27:28.878
No, thanks, Diz.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.040
What's your malfunction,
Rico?

27:34.119 --> 27:36.815
You are.

27:36.888 --> 27:39.254
I joined up to get out on my own
and you had to tag along.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.686
You think I joined the
Mobile Infantry because of you?

27:43.762 --> 27:45.753
You saying you didn't?

27:53.471 --> 27:56.065
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

27:56.141 --> 27:59.201
What makes you even think you're
going to make squad leader, Rico?

27:59.277 --> 28:00.767
Something I've got you don't.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.643
- You rich kids are all the same.
- It isn't about that.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.342
It's about who's the best.

28:17.228 --> 28:18.661
First squad!

28:25.503 --> 28:28.597
Sir, I don't understand.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.834
Who needs a knife
in a nuke fight anyway?

28:30.909 --> 28:34.538
All you gotta do
is push a button. Sir.

28:34.612 --> 28:36.079
Cease fire!

28:37.182 --> 28:39.116
Put your hand
on that wall, trooper!

29:00.839 --> 29:04.935
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.006
Medic!

29:12.817 --> 29:15.285
Ah, well. We all have
one thing in common.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.322
We were all stupid enough
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

29:18.389 --> 29:19.617
Breckinridge,
what's your excuse?

29:19.691 --> 29:22.353
My family's all farmers.
I hate farming.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.521
Mobile Infantry? It's like
pure picnic by comparison.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.964
All right, so they grow 'em big
and dumb on the farm planet, huh?

29:29.033 --> 29:31.593
- And pretty!
- I like big.

29:31.669 --> 29:34.638
- Djana'd, what about you?
- Oh, I'm goin' in for politics.

29:34.706 --> 29:38.039
And, you know, you gotta be a
citizen for that, so here I am.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.873
- Ah, you want some responsibility.
- Yeah.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.140
Shujumi! Come on,
let's keep it going.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.944
I got into Harvard, but my
father says, "Forget it."

29:46.017 --> 29:48.781
It's gonna cost an arm and a
leg, you know? If I serve...

29:48.853 --> 29:53.017
- Federation pays my way!
- I want to have babies.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.389
It's a lot easier to get
a license if you serve.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.958
I'm going career.
Officer's training. All the way.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.397
Future sky marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.599
- Who asked you to be so nosy?
- What, I'm the bad guy?

30:07.672 --> 30:11.335
I'm gonna be a writer.
A writer's got a right to be nosy.

30:11.409 --> 30:15.470
Hey, Flores. You know Rico from
Buenos Aires. What's his story?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.775
He's here
because of a girl.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.054
Lover boy!

30:26.424 --> 30:29.450
- He's gettin' me excited!
- He's gonna blow!

30:32.764 --> 30:34.459
Is it you?

30:38.036 --> 30:43.030
This is where we live.
Not much. But it's home.

30:43.107 --> 30:45.940
Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.

30:47.912 --> 30:52.474
Boot's pretty tough. Sometimes,
I think I won't make it.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.018
But then I think about what
you're doing, and I try harder.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.418
Do you mind?

30:59.490 --> 31:01.424
We try harder, baby!

31:05.496 --> 31:09.523
Who knows? They might even
make me squad leader.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.831
Uh-oh. Well,
I better pack it in.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.174
- I love you Carmen.
- Write me!

31:18.843 --> 31:20.777
I'm gonna kill you guys!

31:23.815 --> 31:25.783
Bye! Write me!

31:27.619 --> 31:30.087
Orbit in five, Ibanez!

31:30.154 --> 31:32.247
First one there
gets to fly.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.502
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!

31:51.442 --> 31:54.275
Oh, no! Not Ibanez again!
She's crazy!

31:54.345 --> 31:56.472
Ready! Go!

32:06.190 --> 32:07.748
Deploying wings.

32:51.769 --> 32:54.169
How come you're in such
a good mood? Huh?

32:54.238 --> 32:56.399
'Cause today I get
to fly that.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.988
Pilot Trainee Ibanez
reporting for duty, ma'am.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.899
- Take the number two chair, Ibanez.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:30.041 --> 33:34.705
- Identify.
- Ibanez, ''T"-three-two-five-"A, '' clear.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.718
What are you doing here?

33:42.820 --> 33:46.221
I'm the guy who's gonna
teach you to fly this crate.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.622
Assistant instructor.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.594
Should I call you "sir"?

33:51.662 --> 33:54.290
Only when I give you
an order.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.459
- Prepare for departure.
- It's amazing.

33:57.535 --> 34:01.596
Us running into each other
like this. Maybe it's fate.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.470
Maybe not. I heard about
this crazy girl....

34:04.542 --> 34:06.942
coming through the Academy.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.103
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick....

34:09.179 --> 34:11.808
but a natural.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.011
When it turned out to be you, I just
made sure we would run into each other.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.078
Rodger Young, cleared for
undocking and departure.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.454
All right, Ibanez.
Take her out.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.286
All systems go.

34:49.187 --> 34:52.748
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.

34:52.824 --> 34:57.488
Well, this isn't simulation anymore,
so take her out easy, Cadet.

34:57.562 --> 34:58.961
Yes, sir.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.502
Five meters from object.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.269
Three meters from object.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.782
Clear.

35:23.254 --> 35:26.883
- Don't exceed port speed.
- Or what?

35:26.958 --> 35:31.054
Or they revoke your
flight status... and mine.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.188
Your career is
in my hands.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.901
Steady as she goes, Number Two.
Prepare for warp.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.275
- Yes, ma'am.
- Number One, design for Jupiter orbit.

35:49.347 --> 35:53.215
All crew, all sections.
Stand by to cut in C-drive...

35:53.284 --> 35:55.275
Stellar drive in...

35:55.353 --> 35:57.082
five. Four...

35:57.155 --> 36:00.147
- Ready, steady, go!
- Three, two, one.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.084
We're goin' in! Move!

36:35.560 --> 36:37.494
Man, they're defended!
No way in!

36:39.864 --> 36:42.355
- Flip six, three hole.
- What?

36:42.433 --> 36:44.731
We run a flip six, three hole
play, and you can score.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.633
- Cover me!
- You got it.

36:54.579 --> 36:55.705
Now!

37:03.287 --> 37:05.778
- Thanks, buddy!
- Bastard!

37:22.006 --> 37:23.940
The kid's got some moves.

37:24.008 --> 37:26.442
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.413
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

37:36.487 --> 37:40.856
Look at him. You ever seen
anybody so pleased with himself?

37:40.925 --> 37:44.588
Well, Zim must've had to choose
someone to be his brown-nose.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.569
I couldn't have done it
without you, Diz.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.771
Friends?

37:58.476 --> 38:00.000
Friends.

38:01.212 --> 38:04.010
- Mail call! Levy!
- Yeah, that's me.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.413
- Shujumi!
- Here.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.951
- Rico,
- Here.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.078
- Breckinridge.
- Here.

38:10.154 --> 38:13.385
- Nyla.
- Yeah, here I am. Oh, great. My dad.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.448
That's all, folks.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.996
Hi, Johnny. I'm sorry I haven't
written you sooner, but...

38:27.071 --> 38:30.370
Oh, Rico!
You don't deserve that!

38:30.441 --> 38:34.207
They've really got us going. They must
have made you squad leader by now.

38:34.278 --> 38:36.838
And if they haven't,
tell 'em to talk to me.

38:36.914 --> 38:40.042
See? All it takes is
the love of a good woman.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.641
Now, that is a woman!

38:41.719 --> 38:45.917
Look at that.
Isn't it beautiful?

38:45.990 --> 38:48.823
I love it out here.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.795
That's also the problem,
because...

38:55.866 --> 38:57.925
I think I'm gonna go career.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.703
I want a command...

39:00.771 --> 39:02.864
a ship of my own and,
you know...

39:05.276 --> 39:08.905
I don't think that's gonna leave a
lot of room for you and me, Johnny.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.248
Jeez.

39:12.316 --> 39:15.843
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear...

39:15.920 --> 39:17.251
but, uh...

39:19.423 --> 39:21.516
I have to follow my heart.

39:22.626 --> 39:23.888
I'm sorry.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.627
Write me. All right?

39:28.933 --> 39:31.458
Write me. So that I'll know
we'll always be friends.

39:49.987 --> 39:54.321
Funny how they always want to be
friends after they rip your guts out.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.327
Yeah. Well,
that's what I deserve.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.722
What are you talkin' about?

40:03.033 --> 40:07.834
I joined up for her. I wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for her.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.635
What are you talkin' about?
You made squad leader on your own.

40:13.477 --> 40:16.537
And, hey, you still
got me to kick around.

40:20.384 --> 40:22.318
Fun and games are over,
children!

40:22.386 --> 40:26.720
You will be firing live ammunition
in a simulated combat environment.

40:26.791 --> 40:31.194
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

40:31.262 --> 40:34.026
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

40:34.098 --> 40:37.397
Rico. Take 'em out.

40:37.468 --> 40:40.960
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds!

40:41.038 --> 40:45.702
Maximum score has been 280.
I expect you to do better.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.607
Go!

40:49.847 --> 40:51.781
Stay low! Keep moving!

40:55.686 --> 40:57.551
Shujumi, stay down!

41:07.865 --> 41:09.890
Goddamn it, Breckinridge!
Clear my line of fire!

41:09.967 --> 41:11.992
It's my helmet.
It's all screwed up.

41:12.069 --> 41:14.060
- You're gonna blow the score!
- Man!

41:14.138 --> 41:17.107
- Dumb shit!
- Diz, stay put! What's the problem?

41:17.174 --> 41:19.199
Damn thing keeps
getting in my way!

41:19.276 --> 41:21.141
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

41:21.212 --> 41:23.874
- It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!
- Yeah, right!

41:30.521 --> 41:31.886
Medic!

41:35.025 --> 41:38.825
Rico! You are relieved
of squad command!

41:40.798 --> 41:43.790
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?

41:45.202 --> 41:48.501
He reported a helmet malfunction,
and I asked him to show me. Sir.

41:48.572 --> 41:52.440
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 tactical helmet, Rico?

41:54.078 --> 41:55.511
Sir, no, sir!

41:55.579 --> 42:00.209
Why did you order your man to remove
his helmet during a live fire exercise?

42:00.284 --> 42:04.983
Sir, I needed everyone
in my squad operational, sir!

42:05.055 --> 42:07.523
I wanted to win, sir!

42:22.172 --> 42:25.107
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

42:26.844 --> 42:29.972
Think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

42:31.782 --> 42:34.376
Yes, sir, I do.

42:34.451 --> 42:35.884
All right.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.255
We'll try
administrative punishment.

42:44.995 --> 42:46.724
Prisoner, halt!

43:04.248 --> 43:07.843
Bite down on this, son.
It helps.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.351
I know.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.792
For incompetence of command...

43:22.733 --> 43:24.928
for failure to abide
by safety regulations...

43:25.002 --> 43:28.870
during a live fire exercise....

43:28.939 --> 43:32.636
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...

43:33.410 --> 43:37.471
Recruit Trainee John Rico is sentenced
to administrative punishment.

43:38.849 --> 43:40.043
Ten lashes.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.977
You may carry out the sentence.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.722
One!

43:54.765 --> 43:56.130
Two!

43:58.602 --> 44:00.035
Three!

44:01.972 --> 44:03.132
Four!

44:05.909 --> 44:07.342
Five!

44:09.980 --> 44:11.413
Six!

44:13.117 --> 44:14.550
Seven!

44:16.186 --> 44:17.744
Eight!

44:18.822 --> 44:20.255
Nine!

44:22.059 --> 44:23.492
Ten!

44:35.339 --> 44:39.673
All structures secure. EB X is
high-normal. Switch to slave on my mark.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.976
Thanks. You read my mind.

44:49.153 --> 44:52.281
Oh, third watch always
seems to last forever.

44:52.356 --> 44:56.656
I don't know. Depends on
who you're spending it with.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.796
Something's wrong.

45:05.135 --> 45:07.433
- There!
- No.

45:07.504 --> 45:11.304
I replotted the course.
It's more efficient this way.

45:11.375 --> 45:15.311
Three weeks aboard a starship
and you think you can lick my navs?

45:15.379 --> 45:16.710
Check it.

45:21.819 --> 45:26.415
You know, I was talking with
Captain Deladier and, uh, she said...

45:26.490 --> 45:30.449
Don't change the subject.
Am I right?

45:37.835 --> 45:40.827
Yeah. You're right.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.304
So, what did the captain say?

45:44.608 --> 45:47.907
She thinks we should
team up officially...

45:49.513 --> 45:52.346
and crew for her.

45:52.416 --> 45:55.852
- You and me, huh?
- We're good together, Carmen.

45:55.919 --> 45:59.286
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

45:59.356 --> 46:01.290
I can anticipate you.

46:02.493 --> 46:05.291
You know what I want.

46:06.797 --> 46:10.255
No. What do you want?

46:18.742 --> 46:20.767
There's a gravity field
out there.

46:22.079 --> 46:25.071
- Run a scan. Sensors on.
- There.

46:26.683 --> 46:30.278
- Gravity at two- two-five and rising.
- Report!

46:30.354 --> 46:34.120
We are in the path of an unidentified
object moving toward us at high speed.

46:34.191 --> 46:37.354
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.

46:47.905 --> 46:50.066
Impact: six seconds!

46:50.140 --> 46:51.573
Emergency evasion!

46:56.480 --> 46:58.175
Three....

46:58.248 --> 47:00.045
two...

47:02.052 --> 47:03.178
fire!

47:18.235 --> 47:20.100
Close compartment 21!

47:34.084 --> 47:35.608
Where'd it come from?

47:35.686 --> 47:38.382
It came out of the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

47:40.490 --> 47:43.391
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell them
a loose asteroid's headed their way.

47:43.460 --> 47:45.690
Communications are down, ma'am.
They're gone.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.494
Damage assessment!

47:48.565 --> 47:51.796
Hull's compromised.
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.860
Luck didn't have anything
to do with it.

47:55.105 --> 47:57.039
We have a hell of a flight team.

48:12.289 --> 48:14.780
It really stinks, you goin'.

48:14.858 --> 48:17.918
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry'll
just have to get along without me.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.662
I don't get it.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.362
You took your licks. If they didn't
want you, they would've kicked you out.

48:29.539 --> 48:31.564
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.

48:31.642 --> 48:34.076
I figure that kinda proves
I don't have what it takes.

48:36.313 --> 48:38.713
Your call's goin' through.
Take it there.

48:49.092 --> 48:52.926
- Hi, Mom.
- Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny.

48:52.996 --> 48:55.362
- Dad.
- Where's your uniform?

48:57.167 --> 49:00.466
It's just good to hear
from you. How are you, son?

49:01.471 --> 49:03.939
It's not really working out
here for me, Dad.

49:04.007 --> 49:07.340
I was thinking... I was hoping it
would be all right if I came home.

49:07.411 --> 49:10.539
Well, of course. You should
come home immediately.

49:11.848 --> 49:16.512
- I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.
- Don't say that. Just come on home.

49:16.586 --> 49:18.781
We'll talk things out.

49:18.855 --> 49:20.789
We love you, son.

49:22.426 --> 49:24.894
- My, what's that?
- Looks like rain.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.658
- This time of the year?
- Sure is dark...

49:27.731 --> 49:31.633
Your transmission has been terminated
due to atmospheric interference.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.636
Please try
your call again later.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.743
I'II see ya.

49:44.548 --> 49:47.244
You take that stroll down Washout Lane.
You're only proving one thing.

49:47.317 --> 49:48.750
What's that, Diz?

49:52.322 --> 49:55.223
That you don't have
what it takes to be a citizen.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.893
- Sound off.
- Stand by.

50:13.777 --> 50:15.506
Left, right, left!

50:23.320 --> 50:26.016
Hold it! What's happening?

50:26.089 --> 50:28.080
We got bombed!

50:28.158 --> 50:30.092
Lost the whole city!

50:31.595 --> 50:33.529
Hey, what's goin' on?

50:34.564 --> 50:38.091
- Hey, Kitten, what's goin' on?
- War! We're goin' to war!

50:42.539 --> 50:46.100
The devastation we are seeing
is un paralleled.

50:46.176 --> 50:50.010
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.

50:50.080 --> 50:53.140
Is that Geneva?

50:53.216 --> 50:55.150
Goddamn Bugs
whacked us, Johnny.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.381
The meteor was shot
out of orbit by Bug plasma...

50:58.455 --> 51:02.152
that derived from Klendathu.
The Arachnid's home planet.

51:09.833 --> 51:12.563
Nothing lives
in what was once called...

51:12.636 --> 51:14.228
the Latin paradise.

51:14.304 --> 51:15.737
Oh, Johnny, that's us.

51:15.806 --> 51:19.435
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.

51:24.047 --> 51:25.776
It's home.

51:28.185 --> 51:31.951
The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...

51:32.022 --> 51:34.991
for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.

51:41.898 --> 51:43.422
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.435
- I want combat, sir!
- The only way you'll see combat...

51:46.503 --> 51:49.802
is if you bust yourself
to private. Get me?

51:49.873 --> 51:52.103
Yes, sir. I get you.

51:52.175 --> 51:55.338
- Sir!
- What do you want, Rico?

51:55.412 --> 51:58.472
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

51:58.548 --> 52:00.641
You already signed your 1240-A.

52:00.717 --> 52:04.414
- It wouldn't be legal.
- Major, I know it was wrong.

52:04.488 --> 52:07.184
I didn't learn from one mistake.
And I made another. Sir.

52:07.257 --> 52:09.225
You made your decision, son.

52:09.292 --> 52:12.523
Sir, my family...
my whole family....

52:12.596 --> 52:15.156
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

52:17.033 --> 52:19.092
Is this your signature, Rico?

52:20.170 --> 52:22.832
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

52:26.409 --> 52:29.207
Doesn't look like it to me.

52:31.915 --> 52:33.212
Carry on, Private.

52:47.864 --> 52:52.927
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow...

52:53.003 --> 52:54.868
then anger.

52:54.938 --> 52:57.236
The only good Bug is a dead Bug!

52:57.307 --> 53:00.799
In Geneva.
The Federal Council convenes.

53:00.877 --> 53:02.811
We must meet the threat....

53:02.879 --> 53:06.940
with our valor, our blood...
indeed with our very lives...

53:07.017 --> 53:11.681
to ensure that human civilization.
Not insect....

53:11.755 --> 53:16.749
dominates this galaxy now and always.

53:16.826 --> 53:20.626
Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans
for an offensive against Klendathu...

53:20.697 --> 53:23.860
source of the Bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.

53:26.336 --> 53:28.270
Every day, federal scientists...

53:28.338 --> 53:30.966
are looking for new ways to kill Bugs.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.509
Your basic Arachnid warrior
isn't too smart...

53:33.577 --> 53:35.977
but you can blow off a limb....

53:37.681 --> 53:40.445
and it's still 86% combat effective.

53:40.517 --> 53:44.214
Here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem
and put it down for good.

53:48.124 --> 53:50.456
Would you like to know more?

53:50.527 --> 53:54.122
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

53:56.633 --> 54:01.127
The war effort needs your effort
at work, at home, in your community.

54:04.441 --> 54:06.739
We now break net and take you live...

54:06.810 --> 54:09.904
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga
deep inside...

54:09.980 --> 54:12.949
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone,
where the men and women...

54:13.016 --> 54:16.417
of the Federal Armed Services
prepare to attack.

54:16.486 --> 54:20.479
DXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

54:20.557 --> 54:25.153
No one here in the AQZ knows when
the invasion of Klendathu will occur...

54:25.228 --> 54:28.891
but everyone's talking about it,
and the talk says tomorrow.

54:28.965 --> 54:31.866
Here's a bunch of M.I. Kids who
look like they eat Bugs for lunch.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.527
Yum, yum, yum.

54:33.603 --> 54:35.696
So, trooper, you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

54:35.772 --> 54:39.037
Shoot a nuke down a Bug hole,
you got a lot of dead Bugs. Am I right?

54:39.109 --> 54:42.374
I just hope it's not over
before we get some.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.879
Some say the Bugs were provoked
by the intrusion of humans...

54:44.948 --> 54:46.506
into their natural habitat...

54:46.583 --> 54:50.576
that a "live and let live" policy
is preferable to war with the Bugs.

54:50.654 --> 54:52.918
Let me tell you something.
I'm from Buenos Aires...

54:52.989 --> 54:55.184
and I say kill 'em all!

54:57.027 --> 54:58.961
Big bad Bugs, huh?

54:59.029 --> 55:02.487
- Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.
- Let's all get cut together.

55:02.565 --> 55:04.965
- What do I want a tattoo for?
- What? Your skin's too pretty?

55:05.035 --> 55:06.969
Come on. Everybody's doing it.

55:19.716 --> 55:22.776
At ease. Guess I ought to lose
the hat when I'm off duty.

55:29.359 --> 55:32.157
My mother was right about you.

55:32.228 --> 55:36.062
- You look great in a uniform.
- You look pretty good yourself.

55:37.934 --> 55:42.394
So, what do you hear? You know about
anyone who made it out of B.A. Alive?

55:42.472 --> 55:45.134
Most of the time,
I don't think about it.

55:45.208 --> 55:47.142
Like it happened to someone else.

55:47.210 --> 55:50.976
Then it hits me,
and I can't stop crying.

55:51.047 --> 55:54.346
Well, we're still alive.
You've got to be happy about that.

55:55.352 --> 55:58.651
You don't look very happy to see me.

55:58.722 --> 56:01.190
Should I be?

56:01.257 --> 56:04.454
Johnny, it's different now.

56:05.595 --> 56:07.586
We're at war.
I think what I did was probably...

56:07.664 --> 56:10.326
the best thing for both of us.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.335
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant?

56:13.403 --> 56:15.598
Zander, you remember Johnny?

56:15.672 --> 56:18.038
Zander and I are a flight team now.

56:18.108 --> 56:20.042
We're the best in the Fleet.

56:21.444 --> 56:25.380
I get it. This is the part
that's best for both of us.

56:25.448 --> 56:27.848
Don't do me any more favors.

56:27.917 --> 56:30.943
- Johnny, wait.
- For get it. He's Mobile Infantry.

56:31.020 --> 56:35.548
See, when you're trained to kill,
it just doesn't pay to be polite.

56:35.625 --> 56:37.786
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

56:37.861 --> 56:40.887
I think you heard me.

56:40.964 --> 56:43.990
You wanna make
something of it, Private?

56:45.702 --> 56:49.695
Not with an officer. No, sir,
The M.I. Doesn't mint stupid troopers.

56:50.807 --> 56:52.832
- Well, let's disregard rank.
- Zander, please.

56:54.210 --> 56:57.668
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.841
- Don't do this.
- Come on. What's he gonna do?

57:17.300 --> 57:19.097
I'm gonna kill you!

57:25.208 --> 57:27.142
Quit it! He's not worth it!

57:29.679 --> 57:31.237
Forget it, Rico.

57:31.314 --> 57:33.544
Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix.

57:35.819 --> 57:37.753
Come on, let's go.

57:39.722 --> 57:41.656
Jarheads!

57:43.493 --> 57:46.189
Mobile Infantry rules!

57:46.262 --> 57:48.230
Oh, God, that hurts!

57:48.298 --> 57:52.792
Well, I got something that might hurt
just a little bit more, buddy.

57:52.869 --> 57:56.635
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight!
And we're gonna win!

58:14.324 --> 58:18.260
This is the captain.
All personnel prepare for drop.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.888
We are at ''D'' minus three and counting.

58:32.375 --> 58:35.367
We are going in with the first wave.

58:35.445 --> 58:37.572
Means more Bugs for us to kill.

58:37.647 --> 58:41.413
You smash the entire area. Kill
anything that has more than two legs.

58:41.484 --> 58:43.952
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!

59:31.968 --> 59:34.732
- Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
- Bug batteries.

59:34.804 --> 59:37.671
According to Military Intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

59:39.309 --> 59:43.837
- Drop status?
- Drop is 35% complete, ma'am,

59:49.652 --> 59:52.177
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:08.370
Remember your training
and you will make it back alive!

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.158
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:32.023
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.904
Someone made a big goddamn mistake!

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.913
Break for high orbit!

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.877
- Rocket's up!
- Rocket crew, move up!

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.136
Nuke 'em!

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:30.008
- Levy, Rico!
- Heat 'em up.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.912
You're set.

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.543
Fire!

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.592
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.429
First Platoon, left flank!

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.993
Spread out!

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.005
First and second squads, follow me!

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.510
Fire!

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.728
Here they come!

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.566
- Ace, what are we doing?
- I don't know.

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.870
I don't know!

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.041
Kill them! Kill them all!

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.320
Come on!

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.394
Come on! You want some?

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:57.330
Here's some! Yeah!

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.334
Take some of this!

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.297
Oh, my God!

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:25.256
Let's get out of here!

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.697
Fall back!

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:59.151
What's going on?

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.924
- You got com?
- It's a general retreat!

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:03.932
Back to the boats!

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:11.229
We've just landed here on what
cap troopers are calling the Big "K"...

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:14.003
with the Sixth Mobile Infantry Division.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:17.102
It's an ugly planet, a Bug planet...

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.238
a planet hostile to life as we...

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.246
Help me!

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.740
Come on! Go!

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.710
Get out of here, now!

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.695
Crisis for humankind.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:16.323
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.731
the Arachnid's defensive capability.

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.462
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:25.029
Sky Marshall Dienes resigns.

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.769
His successor,
Sky Marshall Tahat Meru...

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.311
outlines her new strategy.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.313
To fight the Bug....

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.077
we must understand the Bug.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:38.552
We can ill afford another Klendathu.

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.555
Would you like to know more?

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.750
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:45.658
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.855
When a colony reaches a certain size...

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.490
three hundred generations
or something... it gets smarter.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.034
Insects with intelligence?
Have you ever met one?

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.662
I can't believe
I am hearing this nonsense!

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.002
This is the most ridiculous
conversation I have ever had!

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:02.807
Maybe there is some kind of Bug
that we haven't seen yet...

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:05.506
a leadership caste of hive brains!

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.742
Brain Bugs?
Frankly, I find the idea...

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.479
of a Bug that thinks offensive.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.765
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.361
Affirmative, Rodger Young.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:33.703
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.
Welcome back.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.537
My God!

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.412
How could this happen?

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.917
We thought we were smarter
than the Bugs.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.426
It's strange.
There's almost no wounded at all.

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.428
Bugs don't take prisoners.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.264
Oh, no!

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.196
- There he is,
- Come on. Let's wake him up.

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:22.174
- Wake up!
- How you doing, fish boy? Look!

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:26.620
- You're dead!
- Killed in action!

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.519
Three more days and you're out.

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:32.891
Good as new.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.896
- See ya later.
- Bye.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.560
What did you hear about our new unit?

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.858
Roughnecks killed more Bugs
than any other outfit on Big "K".

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.899
I hear the lieutenant's
a real nut-buster.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.927
Who's top kick?

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.540
You want the job, huh?

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:23.009
- I wouldn't mind.
- I would.

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:27.343
- Just doing my part.
- Orders.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.479
Yours?

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:35.353
- Where you been besides Big "K"?
- Outer Rings. Zegema Beach.

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:41.118
- I always wanted to go there.
- Good luck. It's not there anymore.

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:44.791
So I hear your lieutenant's
a real nut-buster.

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:50.565
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:53.199
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.577
- Same for me.
- Me too.

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.907
Well, sounds like he's quite a guy.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.917
Who do you think saved your ass?

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.580
Stand by!

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.589
Attention on deck!

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:21.995
This is for you new people.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.062
I only have one rule.

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:27.540
Everyone fights. No one quits.

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:31.909
You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.
You get me?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.073
We get you, sir!

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.152
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rasczak's Roughnecks!

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:41.513
At ease! Listen up!

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:45.151
Got a new sky marsh all
and a new battle plan.

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:47.821
We're gonna clean out the system's
outlying Klendathu....

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:50.057
one planet at a time.

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.191
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:56.397
After Fleet glasses the planet,
M. I. Mops up.

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.030
Carry on,

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:49.747
All right.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.089
Spread out! Fire teams!

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.686
You locate a Bug hole, nuke it.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.395
Watkins. Take out Flores and Rico.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.907
Copy that. Move out!

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:09.705
First Platoon.
We're going for that ridge.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.645
- Levy, with me.
- No, I'm going with Rico.

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.648
Shut up and follow me!

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.485
Like it like that?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.319
It's dead, Watkins!

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.730
Ain't much to look at after
you scrape 'em off your boot.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.232
Bug hole.

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:09.964
There.

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.950
Nuke 'em, Rico!

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:34.421
Fire in the hole!

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:49.841
- Get over here!
- Move!

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:02.924
- You got a Bug problem, ma'am?
- Stow it, Trooper!

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:29.812
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, move!

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.417
Get down!

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.271
- Call for retrieval.
- Medic!

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:09.181
Nice moves.
Where did you learn how to do that?

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:12.448
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.422
I was captain of the team.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.288
- Rico?
- Sir?

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.127
I need a corporal. You're it, until
you're dead or I find someone better.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:26.525
Thank you, sir.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.694
- Saddle up!
- Way to go, Corporal!

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.996
- I need a squad leader.
- Oh, no.

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:35.669
I've been there and blew it.
I'm just here to fight.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.113
What about it. Diz?

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.216
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.564
Listen up!

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:01.090
I expect the best,
and I give the best!

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.640
Here's the beer!

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.179
Here's the entertainment!

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:19.076
Have fun! That's an order!

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.725
Thank you, Lieutenant!

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.826
You kill Bugs good.

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.493
Thanks.

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.631
You knew the lieutenant before the war.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.538
What was he like?

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.237
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.939
He always had this little smile.

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:48.380
Well, he don't smile much anymore.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:53.281
Well, I guess your bottle fills up
real quick when your kids get smeared.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:55.619
- Come on, Corporal.
- I don't do that anymore.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:58.215
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.761
Do I have to pull rank?

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.498
Excuse me, sir.

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:17.937
You once asked me for advice.
Want some now?

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.537
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant.

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:21.548
HQ is on the com.

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:26.382
Never pass up a good thing.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.656
Beer?

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:01.983
So, Rico, what are you doing
after the dance?

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.471
What's so funny?

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.031
You know, just the way things work out.

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.191
We finally got together, Diz.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.561
I love you, Johnny.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:37.043
We're moving out. There's been a
distress call from planet "P".

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:39.211
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.222
- Yes, sir.
- Who's that with you?

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.887
Flores, sir.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:52.391
- Make it 20 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:56.001
Twenty minutes?

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.005
We can do it.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:39.837
Whiskey to Outpost. Do you copy? This
is Roughneck Two- Zero on tack three.

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.745
Come in, please?

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.948
- Any contact with General Owen?
- No, sir.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:50.685
- Not even the transponder signal.
- It's these canyons.

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.023
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.717
Sugar, your weapon.

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:39.365
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.842
You're acting sergeant. Move 'em out.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.179
You heard the lieutenant! Saddle up!

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:44.063
Someone really humped the bunk.

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.403
- Watkins?
- Sir?

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.704
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:50.073
Yes. Sir.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.511
Give me three up on the tower, now!

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.639
O. P. There! O. P. There!

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:56.707
Siren Two, police up these bodies!

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:58.718
It stinks in there.

01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:01.277
- Rico?
- Yes, sir?

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.290
We need retrieval. This place crawls.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:06.156
Get somebody in a communications tent
and get me an uplink.

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:09.162
- Diz, check it out.
- Man group with me.

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.328
Lieutenant!

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:21.842
Dirty Bugs came in
right when they were having chow.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.174
This is where they got in.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.516
I think you're gonna wanna see this.

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:40.152
- What have you got, Flores?
- God, I hate this pl ace.

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.941
What's that look like to you, Rico?

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.476
Looks like a Bug was in his brain.

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.858
They sucked his brains out.

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.864
Open that.

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.911
Officer on the deck!

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.504
Pick up the general.

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:36.243
Is it safe?
We've got to get out of here!

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.579
Sir!

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:44.755
Thank God for you. All of you.

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:47.989
You're all gonna be heroes,
every last one of you.

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:50.690
- Close that hole.
- Yes. Sir.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:54.462
I had to evade capture. The security
of the Federation was at stake.

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:01.068
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:03.201
- I need that uplink.
- Working on it, sir.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.178
- Damn it!
- See?

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:08.579
They get in your mind.
Look, they did it to Farley.

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:12.211
They got into his mind.
They make you do things.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.848
- They made Farley call headquarters.
- The distress call was a trap.

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:19.256
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:21.557
They wanna know us
so they can kill us.

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:24.063
Roughnecks, this is Lead.
Prepare for attack.

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.123
- We're gonna be attacked.
- Where's the retrieval boat?

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.725
Mayday. This is Roughneck Two-Zero
to Battle Group. Do you read?

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:32.136
Oh, God! We're gonna die!

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:35.107
Don't you understand?
We're all gonna die!

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:41.104
- Control yourself, General.
- I can't!

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:44.549
I can't!
I wish you'd just shoot me.

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:50.280
He's just a little
out of his mind, sir.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:51.659
Bugs!

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.422
Bugs!

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:55.758
- Die!
- All right.

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:59.596
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:02.659
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.339
I got Bugs!

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:25.325
Magazine!

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:39.036
Fire at will!

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:19.903
Incoming!

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:54.110
Rico! Where's my communications?

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:56.377
- Diz, status on the uplink?
- Give me a minute.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.385
We don't have a minute!

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:09.622
Battle Group,
this is Roughneck Two-Zero.

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:11.756
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
- We are under attack, sir!

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:14.393
- We need retrieval now!
- We have Planet "P'' as clear.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:16.562
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:18.935
- What's your position?
- Come down on this transmission.

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:22.339
- The Outpost? That's crazy!
- I hope you have a crazy pilot! Out!

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:58.239
Lieutenant! Boat coming down, sir!

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:00.610
Fall back into the compound!

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.615
Fall back!

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:29.072
Hold here! Hold what you got!

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.788
Running low!

01:32:42.857 --> 01:32:46.384
- I'm out!
- Here! Make 'em count!

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.704
Take cover and fire! Fall back!

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:25.323
Move!

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:30.427
Fall back to the boats! Haul ass!

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.934
- You know what to do!
- Yes, sir!

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.806
Do it, Rico!

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:06.995
Ace, help me! Hold her down!

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:13.298
Move! Get her into the boat!

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:18.037
- Come on, Diz! Don't die on me!
- Get her out! Let's go!

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.246
Let's go! Get aboard!

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:29.685
Tower, let's go!

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.531
Let's move it. Tower!

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.171
Lift off!

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:20.264
I'm dying.

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:24.406
No. You're gonna be all right.

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:26.412
It's all right...

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:30.273
because I got to have you.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:39.726
Johnny, don't let me go!

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:05.883
This is Battle Control. Proceed
on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:11.086
I think you should know...

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:13.558
your friend Rico is back there.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:26.238
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to blast that rock.

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:28.241
On whose authority, Corporal?

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:31.506
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:35.541
Rodger Young,
we have an official request....

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:39.746
by the Mobile Infantry to commence
bombardment of planet "P."

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.288
I thought you were dead.

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:45.416
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:47.483
Negative on your request.
The sky marshall...

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:49.529
has other plans for planet "P."

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.087
Welcome back.

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:54.259
M. I. does the dying,
and Fleet just does the flying.

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:56.326
Hold on. Something's up.

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.564
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:29.836
Attention on deck!

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:38.744
Once, somebody asked me...

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:43.215
if I knew the difference between
a citizen and a civilian.

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:47.186
I can tell you now.
A citizen has the courage...

01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:51.748
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:58.421
Dizzy was my friend.

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.364
She was a soldier...

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.561
but more than that...

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:05.036
she was a citizen of the Federation.

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:09.366
Present arms!

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:30.694
Order arms!

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:36.767
Left face!

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.951
- Officer on deck.
- Carry on.

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.988
Burial detail, dismissed.

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:06.564
- At ease.
- How are you, Carl?

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:08.863
Carmen, good.

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:11.769
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on "P."

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.307
That mission had a very low
survival probability.

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.502
The Bugs I aid a trap for us,
didn't they?

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:20.245
Elegant proof of intelligence,
isn't it?

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:22.805
We thought there might be
a Brain Bug on "P."

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:24.817
You knew, and you sent them anyway?

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:28.343
We couldn't afford to launch
an operation if there wasn't one.

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:32.049
You don't approve.

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.753
Well, too bad.

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.694
We're in this for the species,
boys and girls. It's simple numbers.

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:38.994
They have more, and every day...

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:42.160
I have to make decisions that send
hundreds of people to their deaths.

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:45.262
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.705
That's what the Mobile Infantry's
good for.

01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:50.566
I hope you're ready for more.

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:54.011
We're going back to "P"
to capture that Brain.

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:58.850
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:01.479
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:05.651
I'll take it, until I get killed
or you find someone better.

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:12.130
Well?

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:16.302
Take care of yourself.

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:18.304
I'll see you again.

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.480
Officer on deck!

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:54.098
- Who are all these kids?
- We got reinforced.

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:56.335
Most of them
are fresh out of boot.

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.435
We're the old men, Ace.

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:03.045
This is for all you new people.

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:05.244
I only have one rule.

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:08.413
Everyone fights. No one quits.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:11.686
You don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:15.125
- Do you get me?
- We get you, sir!

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:19.962
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rico's Roughnecks!

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:25.299
Today we're gonna pay a visit
to Bug City.

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:28.068
We're looking for a Bug
no one's ever seen before.

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.235
Some kind of smart Bug.

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.343
And it probably knows we're coming.

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:40.215
Saddle up!

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.636
Evasive action.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.962
Get us clear for warp, Number Two.

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.464
Clear in five, four...

01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:27.466
Initiating star drive in five...

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:53.760
This is Rodger Young.
We're going down.

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:57.524
Get out! Abandon ship! Come on!

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:03.868
- Zander!
- Here!

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:07.134
- We've got to get to the rescue deck!
- Come on!

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:25.416
Captain!

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:30.419
Abandon ship. That is an...

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:34.200
She's dead, Carmen!

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:55.818
Here!

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.768
Follow me!

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.175
Ready?

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:33.352
Hit it!

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:52.803
Life pod Bravo- Six-Three-Two, abort.

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:02.555
Scouting for a landing zone.

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:04.453
Checking terrain. Here!

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:07.516
- Can you handle that?
- Piece of cake.

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:13.631
We've lost the Rodger Young.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.568
Fleet Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.179
Rodger Young just burned up.

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:29.181
It's on the rescue net.

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:33.709
Any survivors?

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:36.347
Well, they're getting
tarred up there pretty bad.

01:46:36.423 --> 01:46:39.449
Life pod Bravo- Six-Two-Three, abort!
Is anyone receiving?

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:42.518
Affirmative.
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.757
You're breaking up. Say again.

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:47.129
- Carmen?
- Say again. I'm losing you.

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:56.739
Prepare for landing!
Retro in three, two, one.

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:58.801
Fire!

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:17.926
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.522
Get out.

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.942
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Are you receiving? Over.

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.380
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Carmen, are you receiving?

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.745
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Carmen, are you receiving?

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:36.749
Johnny, is that you?

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:39.513
Yeah, it's me!
What's your position and situation?

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.645
We're in Bug City,
20 meters underground.

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:46.715
Position: south 42. east 118.
Situation is...

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:49.261
I repeat, south 42, east 118.

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:57.292
Situation is extremely hostile.

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:03.632
I need a squad to pull 'em out!

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.940
- Direction?
- Three clicks, south by southwest.

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.286
Look out!

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:35.507
- What do you wanna do?
- You heard the lieutenant!

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:38.169
Rescue party!

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:41.112
- Search squad, come with me!
- Cancel that!

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:45.350
You know as well as I do
she's already dead.

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:50.589
Sorry, buddy.

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:55.220
Roughnecks, let's move.

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:57.820
All right.

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:14.446
Why didn't they kill us?

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:16.778
They want us alive.

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:13.104
We should go this way.

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.806
"A" company's that way.

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.741
Yeah.

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:21.280
But Carmen's down there.

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:24.579
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she'd dead.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:29.088
- She's still alive.
- How do you know?

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:32.420
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
- Listen.

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:36.622
You got command, but going
off mission. That's a serious offense.

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:39.529
Yeah. I think they hang you for that.

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:45.464
Roughneck Two-Zero, proceed on mission.

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:47.802
I need two volunteers.

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:02.448
One day, someone like me...

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:05.006
is gonna kill you...

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:07.053
and your whole fucking race.

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:08.413
You know what this is?

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:13.046
Sure, you do.

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.713
You're some kind of big, fat,
smart Bug, aren't ya?

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.417
Come on.

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:34.539
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:37.940
Brain Bug sighted
moving west of grid five.

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.970
Run!

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:18.108
- Give me the nuke!
- You trying to be a hero?

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:23.587
I'm trying to kill some Bugs, sir.
Get outta here!

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:29.986
Move!

01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:36.762
You like that?

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:39.327
Come on! You want some more!

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:45.639
You like that? You want a little more?

01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:53.048
Come on!

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:07.158
Down!

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.481
Come on, Carmen.

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:39.731
We did it!

01:55:45.672 --> 01:55:47.799
- What's goin' on?
- We got it!

01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:49.102
Come on!

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:34.417
What's it thinking, Colonel?

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.406
It's afraid.

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:09.485
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:12.786
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.451
Well, that's classified.

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:19.590
You know. Whenever
the three of us are together...

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:22.327
I feel like things
might just work out.

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:25.394
I hope you're right.
We've got one of their Brains now.

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:29.805
Pretty soon we'll know how they think,
and then we'll know how to beat them.

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:32.208
One day, it will all be over...

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:34.838
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:36.848
This is when it turned.

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:42.347
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet.
It wasn't some fancy new weapon.

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:49.787
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:50.954
Come on!

01:57:54.567 --> 01:57:57.900
He got him! Yeah!

01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:00.905
Zim got the Bug, man!

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:04.306
- Good job, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:07.175
That would be Private, sir.

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.681
- Carry on, Private.
- Yes, sir!

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:19.085
What mysteries
will the Brain Bug reveal?

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:21.149
Federal scientists are working...

01:58:21.227 --> 01:58:24.594
around the clock
to probe its secrets.

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:27.963
Once we understand the Bug,
we will defeat it.

01:58:33.773 --> 01:58:35.707
We have the ships.

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:38.539
We have the weapons.

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:40.511
We need soldiers.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.912
Soldiers like
Lieutenant Stack Lumbreiser...

01:58:42.982 --> 01:58:45.143
Over the target area now, Captain.

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.845
And Captain Carmen Ibanez.

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:50.252
This is the captain speaking.
All personnel prepare for drop.

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:53.053
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.

01:58:53.126 --> 01:58:56.254
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

01:58:56.329 --> 01:58:58.092
We need you all.

01:58:58.164 --> 01:59:01.725
Service guarantees citizenship.
