WEBVTT

01:26.283 --> 01:29.418
And what about that one?

01:35.224 --> 01:36.990
That's ursa major.

01:37.058 --> 01:38.488
Very good.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.997
How about the big w there?

01:42.066 --> 01:44.103
- Cassiopeia.
- Yeah.

01:45.205 --> 01:48.903
And how about
that big, bright one?

01:49.572 --> 01:51.638
- That's a planet.
- Very good.

01:52.611 --> 01:54.210
Jupiter?

01:54.278 --> 01:56.775
No, Jupiter we can't see
right now.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.678
What's that smaller body
just off it?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.752
- You see that?
- A moon.

02:02.821 --> 02:04.079
Yeah.

02:05.487 --> 02:08.160
- Is it earth?
- Very good.

03:13.287 --> 03:15.656
Dad!

03:31.975 --> 03:34.411
Shh, shh.

03:35.912 --> 03:37.612
Shh.

03:50.389 --> 03:51.560
Remmy?

03:52.556 --> 03:53.628
Remmy!

03:54.393 --> 03:55.432
Remmy!

03:57.662 --> 03:59.304
That's far enough.

04:29.562 --> 04:31.160
He's coming, remmy.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.870
To here, that one up here,

04:41.939 --> 04:43.710
plus eight would be sixteen.

04:43.779 --> 04:46.318
You would add one more.
That'd be 17.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.043
So I put the one up here
and the one up here,

04:49.112 --> 04:51.650
so that will be eight plus nine.

04:51.719 --> 04:53.322
- I don't know.
- Then let's go...

04:53.391 --> 04:55.360
Dad!

04:57.587 --> 04:58.627
Dad!

05:17.978 --> 05:20.214
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

05:23.521 --> 05:25.749
We don't know where we're from.

05:25.818 --> 05:27.188
I'll get her to bed.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.684
I'll be right back.

05:44.009 --> 05:45.069
Hey.

05:46.703 --> 05:47.808
What's up?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.241
There are strangers nearby.

05:53.511 --> 05:54.584
No.

05:55.713 --> 05:58.313
No. It's just us.

06:00.619 --> 06:02.126
I'm scared.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.890
There's nothing to be scared of.

06:04.789 --> 06:06.728
You're fine on your own.

06:09.794 --> 06:11.966
Are you gonna stay?

06:12.035 --> 06:13.537
Are you?

06:14.634 --> 06:16.571
If you leave the bed,

06:16.640 --> 06:18.740
I'm gonna shave off
your eyebrows.

06:21.746 --> 06:23.745
I will scream
the loudest possible scream

06:23.814 --> 06:26.582
and follow you around
until they grow back.

06:26.651 --> 06:28.077
I'll tie you up
with your own socks

06:28.146 --> 06:29.784
and leave you
by the graves all night.

06:31.319 --> 06:34.454
I will escape, steal the
lighter from where mom hides it

06:34.523 --> 06:35.956
and set the house on fire.

06:36.025 --> 06:37.926
You mom and I are gonna
hold you by your ankles

06:37.994 --> 06:41.323
and then slowly lower you
into the hole in the outhouse.

06:41.392 --> 06:43.633
I will poop on your face
while you're sleeping.

06:45.003 --> 06:46.229
Jesus.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.373
See?

06:49.442 --> 06:51.267
No one's gonna mess
with you, kid.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.041
Good night.

07:00.948 --> 07:03.287
You want me
to leave this one on?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.650
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

How about you?

08:48.026 --> 08:49.055
No.

08:50.359 --> 08:51.596
I wish.

08:53.561 --> 08:54.731
An owl?

08:56.862 --> 08:58.562
How about an elephant?

08:58.631 --> 08:59.934
Nope.

09:02.507 --> 09:04.708
Did you see anything?

09:05.242 --> 09:06.270
Dogs.

09:08.406 --> 09:11.809
Earth isn't what it once was,
you know.

09:11.877 --> 09:13.409
Is that why you left?

09:16.249 --> 09:19.558
We left because we wanted
something more.

09:21.726 --> 09:24.222
We're very lucky
to have this place.

09:25.558 --> 09:27.093
Why?

09:27.162 --> 09:30.635
'Cause someday
it's gonna be just like earth.

09:32.203 --> 09:34.936
- We can talk about it more tomorrow.
- Okay.

09:36.604 --> 09:37.774
You gonna stay?

09:39.870 --> 09:41.705
Y... es.

09:41.774 --> 09:43.511
Yes.

09:43.579 --> 09:45.147
I love you very much.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.310
Love you.

09:49.585 --> 09:51.285
Good night.

09:51.354 --> 09:52.382
'Night.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.318
Reza!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.619
Don't move, okay?
You stay right here.

11:08.159 --> 11:10.130
- I told you!
- Shut up!

11:11.361 --> 11:13.070
What's going on?

11:13.139 --> 11:14.464
Fuck.

11:19.039 --> 11:20.569
What's going on?

11:22.381 --> 11:23.806
Do you see anything?

11:25.812 --> 11:28.687
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

11:45.569 --> 11:46.796
What if it's his son?

11:46.865 --> 11:48.003
Don't.

12:03.487 --> 12:04.921
I count six.

12:06.719 --> 12:08.250
No.

12:08.319 --> 12:10.184
They're changing their voices.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.293
There are only three.

12:19.534 --> 12:21.531
Come on.

12:22.275 --> 12:26.239
Come on! Come on!

12:27.113 --> 12:28.645
Come on!

12:28.714 --> 12:32.608
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

13:04.984 --> 13:07.478
I think the other pig
is still alive.

13:10.586 --> 13:11.823
Hello?

13:13.722 --> 13:15.794
Let it go, rem.

14:36.201 --> 14:38.107
You okay?

14:40.337 --> 14:42.573
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

14:44.549 --> 14:45.840
First rule?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.218
Stay calm.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.748
Stay alive.

15:14.610 --> 15:15.639
Hey.

15:20.349 --> 15:23.614
You are in very, very
good hands, okay.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.486
Remmy!

15:29.187 --> 15:30.286
Get in here!

15:30.354 --> 15:32.128
Get in here right now!

16:00.758 --> 16:01.758
Get inside!

16:15.842 --> 16:17.932
- Do you have remmy?
- Yes!

16:25.752 --> 16:28.316
I need your eyes on the Ridge!

16:31.315 --> 16:32.551
You see anything?

16:37.958 --> 16:38.997
I see him!

16:40.493 --> 16:42.523
- Is he still at the sun?
- Yes!

17:03.680 --> 17:05.053
You lock the door behind me.

17:05.122 --> 17:07.084
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- I know.

17:09.494 --> 17:10.494
Dad, dad!

17:10.554 --> 17:11.723
You stay with your mother.

17:11.792 --> 17:12.821
Dad!

17:35.912 --> 17:38.621
Get inside, get inside now!

17:57.740 --> 17:58.769
Hey.

18:09.016 --> 18:10.044
Okay?

18:47.319 --> 18:48.350
Turn it off.

19:03.740 --> 19:04.769
Mom.

19:06.176 --> 19:08.377
I have to go to the bathroom.

20:31.556 --> 20:33.695
We'll use this.

20:33.764 --> 20:34.793
Come on.

20:39.595 --> 20:40.634
It's okay.

21:10.099 --> 21:11.869
What's going on?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.469
The main lights went off.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.750
Stay here.

23:06.347 --> 23:07.818
Mom.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.430
Drop the blade.

23:24.231 --> 23:25.260
Drop it.

23:38.241 --> 23:40.946
This place doesn't
belong to you.

23:42.681 --> 23:44.114
It was my parents'.

23:47.855 --> 23:50.455
And I don't know
what you did to them.

23:50.524 --> 23:52.089
I don't really care,

23:55.028 --> 23:59.503
but I was born here,
I was raised here,

23:59.572 --> 24:03.639
and I've come a long,
long way to get back.

24:04.934 --> 24:06.642
And I'm here to stay.

24:11.942 --> 24:13.814
I don't wanna hurt you.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.345
So you can leave if you want.

24:20.921 --> 24:22.063
But I'm pretty
sure that you know

24:22.087 --> 24:24.759
what's waiting
for you out there.

24:30.933 --> 24:35.605
I know how to get this
place back on its feet.

24:37.604 --> 24:39.367
And I can protect you.

24:41.145 --> 24:42.370
If you behave.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.124
Stay in sight.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.962
We can go, mommy, we can go.

25:08.031 --> 25:09.804
Mom, we can go, please?

25:09.873 --> 25:12.302
- I know, I know, listen.
- Please let us go, mommy.

25:12.371 --> 25:13.786
Listen, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

25:13.810 --> 25:17.815
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.208
Okay?

25:19.277 --> 25:21.750
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.006
Hey.

26:01.888 --> 26:04.562
I will be right back, okay?

26:05.727 --> 26:07.864
I want you to stay right here.

26:07.933 --> 26:08.962
Promise?

26:10.399 --> 26:11.932
Yeah, okay.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.271
If you move another muscle,

27:30.340 --> 27:33.277
your kid is gonna
be alone with me.

27:38.981 --> 27:40.020
Think!

27:41.022 --> 27:43.892
How is killing me
going to help you?

27:57.769 --> 27:58.808
Okay.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.970
Here's the deal.

28:01.873 --> 28:06.981
For 30 days you don't pull
another stunt like this on me,

28:08.386 --> 28:10.079
I will take this gun,

28:10.148 --> 28:12.053
put it on that table over there,

28:12.122 --> 28:16.320
turn my back around and
walk out on to that porch.

28:17.392 --> 28:18.421
30 days.

28:21.626 --> 28:28.530
And you'll get your chance,
if you still want it.

28:37.976 --> 28:40.014
I want my husband buried.

29:22.592 --> 29:24.256
Stay as long as you need.

29:31.469 --> 29:32.770
We can leave.

29:33.636 --> 29:36.163
Mom, we can leave now.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.940
No, rem, we can't.

33:13.152 --> 33:14.519
We need to talk.

33:22.297 --> 33:25.464
We've got our work
cut out for us.

33:25.532 --> 33:27.052
Luckily we have
everything that we need

33:27.103 --> 33:30.197
to get this place
back on its feet.

33:30.266 --> 33:31.305
Fuck off.

33:35.942 --> 33:36.970
Okay.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.548
Taps should be running,
by the way.

34:42.438 --> 34:43.476
Remmy!

34:53.083 --> 34:54.216
Hey.

34:54.284 --> 34:55.389
Hey, hey, hey.

34:59.588 --> 35:00.520
Hey, it's harmless.

35:00.588 --> 35:02.099
Don't touch me.

35:15.075 --> 35:16.502
What's his name?

35:16.571 --> 35:18.313
It's just a tool.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.362
This is very good.

35:40.563 --> 35:42.634
Can I go play with Steve?

35:43.971 --> 35:45.435
Steve?

35:45.504 --> 35:48.211
The robot, I named him Steve.

35:49.108 --> 35:50.147
Sure.

36:21.142 --> 36:23.136
Can I take your plate?

36:57.749 --> 36:59.977
And... catch.

37:00.046 --> 37:01.075
Yay.

37:02.148 --> 37:03.176
Come here.

37:04.479 --> 37:05.519
Yay.

37:14.832 --> 37:15.859
Catch.

37:27.441 --> 37:29.807
My name's Jerry, by the way.

37:30.741 --> 37:33.041
My parents ever mention me?

37:38.382 --> 37:39.421
Guess not.

37:42.190 --> 37:44.294
Guess there was no point.

37:45.561 --> 37:47.830
Made it pretty clear
I was never coming back.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.431
Leave me alone.

37:50.896 --> 37:54.469
I didn't wanna be here either,
you know.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.669
There was nowhere else left.

37:58.738 --> 38:01.509
Cities, other settlements,
all gone.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.328
She's a cute kid.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.130
I didn't kill your mother.

38:30.502 --> 38:31.736
That's good of you.

38:31.805 --> 38:34.773
She was already
dead when we got here.

38:38.314 --> 38:40.812
I never saw any of your cities.

38:42.644 --> 38:47.384
Our transport got shot down
when we entered the atmosphere.

38:47.453 --> 38:49.018
Your dad took us in.

38:50.429 --> 38:53.761
Then one day, when I was
seven months pregnant,

38:53.829 --> 38:57.266
he stuck a rifle in our faces
and told us to leave.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.763
Why would he do
a thing like that?

38:58.832 --> 39:02.471
He figured it out,
that we were from earth.

39:04.873 --> 39:08.642
So I slit his throat with
the knife you just washed.

39:10.107 --> 39:13.647
If you touch her,
I'll carve your heart out.

39:15.945 --> 39:17.210
You could empty out a whole gun

39:17.279 --> 39:20.550
of yours into me,
I'd still get to you.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.755
You assume a lot about me.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.699
I see no reason why
I'd need to touch her.

39:53.181 --> 39:56.024
Can Steve sleep with us?

39:56.093 --> 39:58.252
I don't think it sleeps.

40:01.766 --> 40:02.795
Come on.

40:04.001 --> 40:05.028
Good night.

40:07.829 --> 40:08.867
Good night.

40:31.121 --> 40:33.991
Get into bed,
I'll be right there.

41:04.391 --> 41:07.090
Hi, hey, cassy.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.260
Wait here, Steve.

41:19.769 --> 41:20.875
Come on, cassy.

41:20.944 --> 41:21.973
Yes.

41:23.775 --> 41:25.339
You in there, kid?

41:29.350 --> 41:34.657
Hey, so I know,

41:35.760 --> 41:38.726
I know that I'm not supposed to
be talking to you,

41:40.093 --> 41:45.359
but I lost something
from a notebook I keep.

41:47.764 --> 41:48.802
An old drawing.

41:51.938 --> 41:55.072
You wouldn't know
anything about that?

41:58.043 --> 42:00.583
Do you think maybe
Steve took it?

42:05.523 --> 42:10.818
Anyways, um, I just came
to tell him

42:10.887 --> 42:14.531
that he can keep it.

42:15.792 --> 42:16.863
I won't snitch.

42:18.827 --> 42:19.866
All right?

43:09.912 --> 43:11.319
Remmy?

43:24.059 --> 43:25.096
Smells good.

43:27.930 --> 43:29.997
Where's the kid?

43:30.066 --> 43:31.608
Just called her.

45:03.059 --> 45:04.558
Are you getting up?

45:46.542 --> 45:48.140
Have you seen remmy?

46:08.929 --> 46:11.493
Go away, Steve, it's not safe.

46:13.599 --> 46:14.628
Go!

46:18.967 --> 46:20.007
Go.

46:25.246 --> 46:29.141
And tell my mom that she
can have another daughter.

46:29.210 --> 46:30.248
With Jerry!

49:09.447 --> 49:10.474
Remmy!

52:36.679 --> 52:38.814
Hard to miss, isn't it?

52:44.355 --> 52:46.393
Once you know it's there.

52:51.102 --> 52:54.027
I was eight when
my parents told me.

53:03.344 --> 53:04.745
So you wanna know
what's out there?

53:04.813 --> 53:05.841
Obviously.

53:08.684 --> 53:09.713
Nothing.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.321
Sand, a rock.

53:14.490 --> 53:20.057
There was once more,
but it's all gone now,

53:20.126 --> 53:21.820
or will be soon.

53:21.889 --> 53:24.295
Then where did you come from?

53:24.364 --> 53:27.896
From the war, for less and less.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.570
I don't believe you.

53:39.813 --> 53:43.685
Ever notice that the
sunrises are getting bluer?

53:43.754 --> 53:45.253
What is that?

53:45.322 --> 53:49.288
It's from the dust
in the atmosphere.

53:49.723 --> 53:54.395
An atmosphere that we
created and maintained.

53:56.091 --> 53:59.191
It's all just blowing
off into space.

54:00.598 --> 54:03.470
I know it's a hard thing
to hear,

54:03.538 --> 54:05.841
you know, but the sooner
that you accept it,

54:05.909 --> 54:08.704
the sooner you'll realize

54:08.773 --> 54:11.808
how lucky we are
to have this place.

54:15.378 --> 54:16.582
We...

54:18.946 --> 54:21.657
We have everything we need,

54:21.726 --> 54:23.820
right here.

54:40.243 --> 54:43.136
Rem, stop playing
with your food.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.646
Come on, you gotta eat.

54:53.090 --> 54:55.654
You don't like sweet potatoes?

54:59.822 --> 55:02.254
I used to not like them either.

56:32.079 --> 56:34.687
I'm going back to my bed, rem.

56:40.762 --> 56:46.061
I think I know what
you're feeling right now.

56:50.701 --> 56:52.903
I would feel the same way.

56:58.582 --> 57:03.309
I just need you to know
that I loved your father

57:05.445 --> 57:09.084
and I love you more
than you will ever know.

57:53.961 --> 57:55.399
Forgot about this.

57:55.468 --> 57:57.473
Wanna learn how to play?

57:58.666 --> 57:59.706
You?

58:00.441 --> 58:02.302
- Little bit.
- Really?

58:03.904 --> 58:05.371
How about a song?

58:06.583 --> 58:08.616
Been a long time since
I heard any music.

58:10.646 --> 58:11.685
Sure.

58:20.689 --> 58:21.728
Come.

58:37.376 --> 58:38.404
Sorry.

58:58.731 --> 59:02.467
♪ Your eyes take me back ♪

59:02.536 --> 59:05.673
♪ to my childhood ♪

59:06.869 --> 59:09.578

59:40.769 --> 59:41.808
Remmy.

59:51.780 --> 59:52.819
Remmy.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.218
Remmy, please.

59:57.885 --> 59:58.924
Remmy.

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.091
Remmy.

01:00:02.464 --> 01:00:04.391
I need you to trust me.

01:00:05.926 --> 01:00:06.965
Remmy.

01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:10.936
I hate you.

01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:14.940
Remmy.

01:00:17.104 --> 01:00:20.506
I hate you.

01:00:42.737 --> 01:00:45.237
Everything okay?

01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:46.334
Mm-hmm.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:11.458
You okay?

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.132
Yeah.

01:01:17.933 --> 01:01:19.334
She's, uh...

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.304
She's just adjusting.

01:01:24.278 --> 01:01:25.307
Hmm.

01:01:52.738 --> 01:01:54.342
You don't have to.

01:02:01.148 --> 01:02:07.250
Nah, I'm just tired
of it weighing me down.

01:02:09.356 --> 01:02:10.385
So.

01:02:46.419 --> 01:02:48.822
Think about your daughter.

01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:49.930
I am.

01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:00.868
What are you doing?

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:08.075
Stop.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.056
Please, please, please.

01:04:29.124 --> 01:04:30.325
No, no, no, no!

01:04:30.394 --> 01:04:32.159
Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

01:04:32.227 --> 01:04:34.331
I'm never gonna hurt you.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.566
I just need you to stay.

01:04:38.635 --> 01:04:41.099
I just need you to stay
until I say you can.

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:42.207
Okay?

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:45.573
Can you do that?

01:04:47.813 --> 01:04:49.181
Can you do that?

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.216
You can come inside now.

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.491
Remmy.

01:05:41.536 --> 01:05:42.564
It's okay.

01:05:47.267 --> 01:05:48.306
It's okay.

01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:11.527
When you're ready.

01:07:09.319 --> 01:07:12.251
Seven piggies in a row,

01:07:12.686 --> 01:07:15.620
if he hollers, then you'll know

01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:18.891
he's the pig who wants to go.

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:29.676
My mother said
to pick the second best one

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:33.873
and it's y-o-u.

01:08:08.409 --> 01:08:09.942
I was thinking.

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:18.720
You might want to give it a go.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:22.388
I'm going to the valley
tomorrow morning.

01:09:23.584 --> 01:09:25.390
Isn't that exciting?

01:09:28.962 --> 01:09:30.495
I'll need Steve...

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:35.665
If that's okay with you.

01:09:40.002 --> 01:09:44.002
He's agreed, provided
that we are back by lunch.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.073
I pointed out that
he doesn't eat lunch.

01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:53.478
And he looks back at me with
that steely gaze of his,

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:56.983
and he says,

01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:01.229
"Jerry,
we've talked about this."

01:10:06.527 --> 01:10:07.565
I saw that.

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:11.734
Eleventh time this year.

01:10:16.537 --> 01:10:17.575
Wild times.

01:11:38.819 --> 01:11:39.921
Who goes there?

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.858
Remmy?

01:11:44.394 --> 01:11:45.432
Is that you?

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:53.268
I knew it.

01:11:53.337 --> 01:11:54.474
You missed me?

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:10.556
You should hop in.

01:12:13.854 --> 01:12:17.365
It's murky but it's clean.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.634
And it feels so good.

01:12:24.701 --> 01:12:27.598
I'll leave a blanket for you.

01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:28.706
Enjoy.

01:14:16.777 --> 01:14:17.914
Want a drink?

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:21.951
Go on.

01:14:27.828 --> 01:14:31.763
Careful now with that one,
the batch is strong.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.771
What do you think?

01:14:44.837 --> 01:14:45.876
Cheers.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.301
Hey, I, I have
something for you.

01:15:18.039 --> 01:15:20.772
I think you're gonna like it.

01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:21.879
Sit over here.

01:15:39.862 --> 01:15:44.836
Go on, just, just take it.

01:16:04.056 --> 01:16:08.057
It helps that you grew up
to look so much like her.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.965
She'd be so proud of you, remmy.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.045
It's okay.

01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:31.886
It's okay, come on.

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:33.612
Okay.

01:16:45.132 --> 01:16:46.132
Come on.

01:16:57.442 --> 01:16:58.470
It's okay.

01:20:05.962 --> 01:20:07.527
So how was your day?

01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:17.845
You know there's no rush.

01:20:20.181 --> 01:20:24.049
The important thing is
that you feel comfortable.

01:20:27.146 --> 01:20:28.188
You know?

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:32.486
All those things that you're
feeling are completely normal.

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:37.227
I can't do it.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.529
Hey.

01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:48.205
I can't do it.

01:20:50.644 --> 01:20:52.176
You can't do what?

01:21:00.718 --> 01:21:01.812
It's okay.

01:21:03.518 --> 01:21:06.116
Like I said,
we've got plenty of time.

01:21:06.185 --> 01:21:07.224
Ever.

01:21:08.354 --> 01:21:09.486
You're still young.

01:21:09.555 --> 01:21:11.931
You're not listening to me.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.166
I haven't had
much practice lately.

01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:22.566
We've been through this before.

01:21:22.634 --> 01:21:25.171
This is bigger than you and me.

01:21:25.239 --> 01:21:27.772
I'm not about to give up.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.279
That's very noble of you.

01:21:31.348 --> 01:21:34.350
A man's gotta stand
for something.

01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:38.585
If you try to force one
inside of me, I will kill it.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.932
Do you know how to do that?

01:21:48.063 --> 01:21:49.101
'Cause I do.

01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:53.039
Pretty dangerous if you don't.

01:21:54.834 --> 01:21:59.111
And then where would
you be without me?

01:22:00.845 --> 01:22:02.147
I don't know.

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:06.315
About where I am now, I guess.

01:22:06.384 --> 01:22:08.545
Gotten pretty good
talking to myself.

01:22:08.614 --> 01:22:11.217
So what are you waiting for?

01:22:11.285 --> 01:22:13.290
Is that what you want?

01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:15.490
Hmm?

01:22:16.422 --> 01:22:18.229
Is that what you want?

01:22:19.562 --> 01:22:22.994
If I just held you down
and did it?

01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:27.671
So you can just keep on
pretending like I'm the bad guy?

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.141
Go on hating me?

01:22:31.811 --> 01:22:34.014
I don't hate you, Jerry.

01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:42.649
Then what is it?

01:23:00.303 --> 01:23:02.702
You think it over some more.

01:23:07.339 --> 01:23:08.378
I have.

01:23:38.537 --> 01:23:40.311
Leave me alone, Steve.

01:24:16.212 --> 01:24:18.008
You going somewhere?

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.846
Give it back!

01:24:52.914 --> 01:24:55.650
If you leave, you're gonna
die in a day, maybe two.

01:24:55.719 --> 01:24:57.400
Stop pretending like
you're doing this for me.

01:24:57.424 --> 01:25:01.459
Okay, all of this,
all of this I did for you!

01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:04.795
If you think there's someone
out there, you're wrong.

01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:06.322
I'm it, okay?

01:25:06.391 --> 01:25:07.431
Me!

01:25:09.529 --> 01:25:11.237
Give me back my mask.

01:25:13.133 --> 01:25:15.507
- You can't control me!
- You're my responsibility.

01:25:15.576 --> 01:25:18.077
- Yeah, and why's that?
- Well, because someone couldn't

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.410
accept the reality
of her situation!

01:25:20.479 --> 01:25:21.785
Well, this time you
don't have a child

01:25:21.809 --> 01:25:23.094
to use to pressure
me into your bed.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:25.512
Okay, you want
your fucking mask?

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.479
Huh?
You want your mask?

01:25:27.547 --> 01:25:28.978
Here's your fucking mask!

01:25:29.047 --> 01:25:31.758
Okay, this is how
it will feel, okay.

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:32.826
This is how it'll end!

01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:33.919
Hmm!

01:26:36.687 --> 01:26:39.424
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:26:39.492 --> 01:26:42.559
It's okay, it's just,
it's okay, it's...

01:26:42.627 --> 01:26:45.089
It's just so that we can talk.
It's okay.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:47.230
- No!
- It's just so that we can talk.

01:26:47.299 --> 01:26:49.162
- Jerry.
- Hey, it's okay.

01:26:49.231 --> 01:26:50.270
Please.

01:26:51.468 --> 01:26:52.970
- I'm sorry.
- Jerry.

01:26:53.039 --> 01:26:55.440
Okay, I'm sorry. It's...

01:26:55.508 --> 01:26:56.887
But, but you leave
and then you're dead.

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.239
And then that will be it.

01:26:58.308 --> 01:26:59.777
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:59.846 --> 01:27:01.347
Okay.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:03.415
And, and I just, I just,
I just can't risk that,

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.684
not, not while there's
still some sort of hope.

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:06.781
Okay?

01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:08.656
Jerry.

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.450
- Jerry, please.
- Hey, hey, hey, wait.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:13.623
Listen to me.

01:27:15.028 --> 01:27:17.461
Can you listen to me?

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:20.531
We both have
a responsibility, okay?

01:27:21.733 --> 01:27:25.363
You and me.
Which neither of us asked for.

01:27:25.432 --> 01:27:26.471
Okay?

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:31.868
You all keep making me
do these terrible things.

01:27:31.937 --> 01:27:33.711
- Yes, we need to...
- No.

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:37.117
- I need you to understand how important this is.
- No.

01:27:37.186 --> 01:27:40.109
Please, I need you to understand

01:27:40.178 --> 01:27:42.014
- that this is so important.
- Okay.

01:27:42.082 --> 01:27:45.784
- Okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- Let me go.

01:27:45.853 --> 01:27:47.620
- Let me go.
- No, it's okay.

01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:50.021
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.231
- Okay, it's okay.
- Let me go!

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.835
It's okay, it's okay,
you're okay.

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:56.501
It's just... shh, shh.

01:27:57.632 --> 01:27:59.164
It doesn't have to be bad.

01:27:59.233 --> 01:28:00.780
It doesn't have to be like...
Please, not like this.

01:28:00.804 --> 01:28:02.571
- It's okay.
- Please, not like this.

01:28:02.639 --> 01:28:04.704
- It's okay.
- Let me go, Jerry.

01:28:04.773 --> 01:28:07.706
Let me go, Jerry,
Jerry, let me go!

01:28:07.775 --> 01:28:09.310
- Stop it.
- Let me leave!

01:28:09.378 --> 01:28:11.348
Stop it!
Stop it!

01:28:11.417 --> 01:28:12.809
Just stop it!

01:28:12.878 --> 01:28:16.513
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

01:28:16.582 --> 01:28:17.621
Okay.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:19.458
Stop it.

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:22.692
Stop it.

01:28:23.624 --> 01:28:25.959
Hmm, okay stop it.

01:28:26.767 --> 01:28:27.796
Stop it.

01:28:29.631 --> 01:28:32.365
It doesn't have to be bad.

01:28:32.434 --> 01:28:34.308
Just, just...

01:28:35.771 --> 01:28:39.544
Okay, just.

01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:44.978
Okay, just close your eyes.

01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:19.419
God!

01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:06.532
You need me as much
as I need you.

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:13.638
I disagree.

01:33:55.591 --> 01:33:57.455
Hello!

01:35:55.745 --> 01:35:57.047
I'm going, Steve.

01:36:00.553 --> 01:36:02.316
You have to stay here.

01:36:04.955 --> 01:36:07.057
Don't look at me like that.

01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:11.061
This is your place now, okay?

01:36:16.227 --> 01:36:17.496
Do you hate me?

01:36:22.904 --> 01:36:24.173
Yeah, me neither.

01:36:28.547 --> 01:36:30.146
The opposite.
