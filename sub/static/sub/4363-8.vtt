WEBVTT

00:06.277 --> 00:08.709
(siren wailing)

00:08.709 --> 00:11.642
TELL ME.
IT'S A GIRL.

00:11.642 --> 00:15.015
YOU DISAPPEAR TO LOS ANGELES.
YOU DON'T RETURN MY CALLS,

00:15.015 --> 00:17.017
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
WE ALL ARE.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
I KNOW WHEN A MAN IS WILLING

00:19.019 --> 00:21.052
TO SACRIFICE ANYTHING
FOR HIS CAUSE,

00:21.052 --> 00:23.454
AND YOU'RE NOT THAT KIND OF MAN,
AGENT BENFORD.

00:23.454 --> 00:26.057
I NEED A FAVOR--A BIG FAVOR.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.159
IT'S FOR TRACY.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.030
HI, DAD.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.063
WHAT I SAW, WHAT YOU SAW,

00:32.063 --> 00:35.035
DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY OUT
THAT WAY.
UH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:35.035 --> 00:38.339
I FOUND A WAY
TO CHANGE THE GAME.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.342
(Pearl Jam's "Unthought Known"
playing)

00:54.525 --> 00:56.757
(Al) DEAR CELIA,

00:56.757 --> 00:59.760
I DON'T KNOW YOUR LAST NAME,

00:59.760 --> 01:01.832
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE,

01:01.832 --> 01:04.335
BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE
TWO YOUNG BOYS--

01:04.335 --> 01:07.098
TWINS, I BELIEVE.

01:07.098 --> 01:11.102
AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A FLASH-FORWARD.

01:11.102 --> 01:14.845
â™ª ALL THE THOUGHTS
YOU NEVER SEE â™ª

01:14.845 --> 01:18.449
â™ª YOU ARE ALWAYS THINKING â™ª

01:18.449 --> 01:21.582
â™ª BRAIN IS WIDE â™ª

01:21.582 --> 01:23.614
â™ª THE BRAIN IS DEEP â™ª

01:23.614 --> 01:27.118
â™ª OH, ARE YOU SINKING? â™ª

01:27.118 --> 01:31.192
â™ª FEEL THE PATH OF EVERY DAY â™ª

01:31.192 --> 01:35.166
â™ª WHICH ROAD YOU TAKING? â™ª

01:35.166 --> 01:39.400
â™ª BREATHING HARD, MAKING HAY â™ª

01:39.400 --> 01:42.203
â™ª YEAH, THIS IS LIVING â™ª

01:42.203 --> 01:47.138
â™ª LOOK FOR LOVE IN EVIDENCE â™ª

01:47.138 --> 01:50.541
â™ª ALL BLACK WITH STARLIGHT â™ª

01:50.541 --> 01:53.144
â™ª FEEL THE SKY â™ª

01:53.144 --> 01:55.446
â™ª BLANKET YOU â™ª

01:55.446 --> 01:59.119
â™ª WITH GEMS AND RHINESTONES â™ª

01:59.119 --> 02:02.893
â™ª SEE THE PATH
CUT BY THE MOON â™ª

02:02.893 --> 02:08.599
â™ª FOR YOU TO WALK ON â™ª

02:12.163 --> 02:15.166
â™ª FOR YOU TO WALK ON â™ª

02:19.670 --> 02:23.644
â™ª YOU WILL BE NO ONE'S RIVAL â™ª

02:26.347 --> 02:32.723
â™ª YOU WILL BE NO ONE'S RIVAL â™ª

02:38.359 --> 02:41.932
â™ª A DISTANT TIME â™ª

02:41.932 --> 02:44.595
â™ª A DISTANT SPACE â™ª

02:44.595 --> 02:47.638
â™ª THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LIVING â™ª

02:47.638 --> 02:50.201
â™ª A DISTANT TIME â™ª

02:50.201 --> 02:52.643
â™ª A DISTANT PLACE â™ª

02:52.643 --> 02:56.907
â™ª SO WHAT YA GIVING? â™ª

02:56.907 --> 03:00.211
(man) THEY ALL SAW FBI AGENT
AL GOUGH ALIVE AND WELL

03:00.211 --> 03:01.882
ON APRIL 29th.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.455
WHAT THIS GUY APPARENTLY
WAS TRYING TO SHOW US

03:04.455 --> 03:07.218
IS WE CAN'T TAKE
WHAT WE SAW FOR GRANTED.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.220
OKAY, BOTTOM LINE IS,
THIS IS A NEW WORLD.

03:09.220 --> 03:12.393
THIS IS A NEW DAY, AND I JUST
THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A MOMENT

03:12.393 --> 03:14.865
AND LET THAT SINK IN.

03:14.865 --> 03:17.398
WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE ANSWERED
RIGHT NOW IS THE QUESTION,

03:17.398 --> 03:20.601
IS THERE GOING TO BE
ANOTHER WORLD BLACKOUT?
MM.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.604
PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED.
LET'S GET BACK
TO THE BIG QUESTION.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.736
WHAT BIG QUESTION?
DO WE HAVE FREE WILL?

03:25.736 --> 03:28.979
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION?
POSSIBLY THE CENTRAL QUESTION
OF HUMAN EXISTENCE

03:28.979 --> 03:30.711
FOR MILLENNIA.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.614
(clears throat)

03:35.215 --> 03:37.348
IF THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR RESIGNATION...

03:37.348 --> 03:39.219
(typing on keyboard)
YOU CAN FORGET IT.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.222
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA LET ME
EXPLAIN MYSELF?

03:42.222 --> 03:46.297
YOU WERE ATTACKED.
YOU WERE SHOT.

03:46.297 --> 03:48.259
YOU RETURNED TO DUTY
TO FIND OUT

03:48.259 --> 03:50.331
A COWORKER
JUMPED OFF A BUILDING.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.504
AM I IN
THE RIGHT BALLPARK HERE?

03:53.504 --> 03:57.408
MY LIFE'S NOT MAKING
A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE RIGHT NOW,

03:57.408 --> 04:00.911
AND I THINK I NEED A LITTLE
TIME OFF TO FIGURE IT OUT.

04:00.911 --> 04:02.813
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

04:02.813 --> 04:06.317
BUT, UH, I NEED YOU HERE.

04:06.317 --> 04:10.651
I KNOW WE'VE BEEN SHORTHANDED
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.523
BUT EVER SINCE GOUGH...

04:13.954 --> 04:16.527
SINCE AL--

04:16.527 --> 04:18.989
THIS ISN'T ABOUT AL.
YES, IT IS.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.434
WHEN I FOUND OUT
ABOUT WHAT HE DID

04:23.434 --> 04:25.265
AND WHY HE DID IT,

04:25.265 --> 04:28.669
IT JUST REALLY MADE ME THINK
ABOUT MY OWN FUTURE.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.772
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.274
DO I LEAN INTO WHAT I SAW?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.607
DO I FIGHT IT?

04:36.607 --> 04:39.450
WHAT IF
MY GETTING SHOT WAS...

04:39.450 --> 04:41.452
I DON'T EVEN KNOW--

04:41.452 --> 04:45.456
SOME--SOME SORT OF A SIGN THAT
THIS BABY'S NOT MEANT TO BE?

04:45.456 --> 04:47.458
YOU'RE GONNA LET
A BULLET DECIDE

04:47.458 --> 04:50.891
WHETHER OR NOT YOU BRING
A BABY INTO THIS WORLD?

04:52.963 --> 04:55.696
IF AL'S DEATH
PROVED ANYTHING,

04:55.696 --> 04:59.029
IT'S THAT OUR CHOICES
STILL MATTER,

04:59.029 --> 05:01.602
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

05:05.736 --> 05:08.779
WELL, I BELIEVE
WITHOUT RESERVATION

05:08.779 --> 05:10.781
OR RECRIMINATION

05:10.781 --> 05:12.543
THAT YOUR CARD

05:12.543 --> 05:14.885
IS THE ACE OF SPADES.

05:14.885 --> 05:16.717
(laughs)

05:16.717 --> 05:19.820
(Simon) WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
ANSWERS THAT QUESTION.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
HOW A NOBEL FINALIST

05:21.822 --> 05:24.024
AND RECIPIENT
OF THE MacARTHUR PRIZE

05:24.024 --> 05:27.798
SPENDS HIS IDLE MOMENTS.
THIS ISN'T THE TIME
OR THE PLACE, SIMON.

05:27.798 --> 05:30.030
YOU DROPPED OFF
THE RADAR, LLOYD.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.363
WITHOUT SO MUCH
AS A PHONE CALL.

05:32.363 --> 05:34.365
I'VE HAD TO CHECK MYSELF
INTO THE HOSPITAL

05:34.365 --> 05:36.767
TO HAVE MY BRUISED EGO
X-RAYED.

05:36.767 --> 05:39.009
HELLO, DYLAN.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.941
REMEMBER ME?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.874
(goofy voice) WHY,
THIS IS NOT MY PANCAKE!

05:43.874 --> 05:47.017
WE'RE NOT HAVING THIS
DISCUSSION IN FRONT OF MY SON.
(normal voice)
YEAH, WELL, I'M DONE

05:47.017 --> 05:49.550
HAVING YOU DICTATE
WHEN AND WHERE WE TALK.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.882
MYHILL FORWARDED ME
THE E-MAIL YOU SENT HIM.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.485
OR SHOULD I CALL IT
A SUICIDE NOTE?
IT'S THE ONLY LOGICAL MOVE.

05:54.485 --> 05:56.727
IF YOU'RE HELL-BENT
ON SELF-DESTRUCTION,

05:56.727 --> 05:59.430
THEN, YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS.

05:59.430 --> 06:03.033
BUT I STILL HAVE DOUBTS AS TO
THE CAUSE OF THE BLACKOUT.
OUR EXPERIMENT KILLED
20 MILLION PEOPLE, SIMON.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.135
20 MILLION.

06:05.135 --> 06:07.398
THE WORLD HAS BEEN UPENDED.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.940
PEOPLE NEED ANSWERS.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.643
WE HAVE TO GO PUBLIC
AND TELL THE WORLD

06:12.643 --> 06:15.876
THAT WE CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

06:17.948 --> 06:19.950
(surf rolling in distance)
ALL RIGHT.

06:19.950 --> 06:23.153
I GUESS WE HAVE TO LEAVE
THIS ROOM SOMETIME.

06:23.153 --> 06:24.955
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:24.955 --> 06:28.819
I HAVE A RESERVATION WITH
THE HOTEL THAT SAYS DIFFERENT.

06:28.819 --> 06:29.960
OH.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.023
PLUS YOU HAVEN'T OPENED
YOUR GIFT YET.

06:33.023 --> 06:34.995
MM, WHAT'S THIS?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.667
OH...

06:36.667 --> 06:40.871
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE.

06:40.871 --> 06:43.834
AND WHAT ARE WE
CELEBRATING?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.906
SECOND CHANCES, I GUESS...

06:47.578 --> 06:51.041
(lowers voice) AND THE FACT THAT
WE CAN CHANGE THE THINGS WE SAW.

06:51.041 --> 06:56.687
I NEVER THOUGHT WE COULDN'T,
MARK.

06:58.749 --> 07:02.753
(cell phone ringing)

07:02.753 --> 07:03.954
(ring)

07:03.954 --> 07:06.126
THAT'S THE OFFICE.
MM-HMM.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.129
I TOLD 'EM NOT TO CALL
UNLESS IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.
MM-HMM.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.961
I PROMISE.
MM-HMM.

07:10.961 --> 07:13.033
(sighs)

07:13.033 --> 07:15.035
YEAH.
(Demetri) Hey, it's me.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.008
THIS BETTER BE GOOD, DEM.

07:18.008 --> 07:20.541
YEAH, I'M SORRY, MAN.
UM, SOMETHING CAME UP.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.013
Did you bring your laptop?
YEAH.

07:23.013 --> 07:24.975
I'M SENDING YOU SOME VIDEO

07:24.975 --> 07:26.977
WE GOT FROM BARSTOW P.D.
THIS MORNING.

07:26.977 --> 07:29.520
Remember when you had Marcie
plug all the clues

07:29.520 --> 07:33.153
off the Mosaic board
into NCIC?
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.556
Yeah. Barstow P.D.
caught a homicide.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.188
Eyewitness managed to
record it on her cell phone.

07:38.188 --> 07:42.132
When it hit the system,
NCIC kicked back a red flag.
WHY?

07:42.132 --> 07:43.994
Stay tuned, man.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.766
(gunshot)

07:50.170 --> 07:52.503
(whoosh)

07:53.904 --> 07:56.807
I'M HEADED BACK RIGHT NOW.

08:06.056 --> 08:10.991
â™ªâ™ª

08:17.998 --> 08:20.230
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

08:20.230 --> 08:22.833
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP US
I.D. OUR TATTOOED FRIEND?
NOT REALLY.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.975
THE VICTIM, NEIL PAROFSKY,
IS AN AERONAUTICS ENGINEER

08:24.975 --> 08:27.037
WHO WORKS OUT OF A PLANT
IN EL SEGUNDO.

08:27.037 --> 08:29.940
WATCH AND WALLET WERE MISSING,
SO EVERYBODY'S THINKING ROBBERY.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.513
IS THAT CONFIRMED BY WHOEVER
SHOT THE CELL PHONE VIDEO?
UH, INGRID ALVAREZ.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.786
YEAH, SHE SAW PAROFSKY
HAND SOMETHING OVER

08:35.786 --> 08:38.819
BEFORE HE GOT SHOT, SO SHE
THOUGHT IT WAS A MUGGING, TOO.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.920
GREAT.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.922
FIRST DAY BACK?

08:41.922 --> 08:44.895
I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN YOU FLOWERS.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.997
THEY'RE FOR YOUR WIFE...
OH.

08:46.997 --> 08:51.061
FOR STITCHING ME BACK TOGETHER.
AND THESE ARE FOR YOU--

08:51.061 --> 08:53.233
HARD COPY STILLS
TAKEN FROM THAT CELL PHONE.

08:53.233 --> 08:57.037
VIDEO FORENSICS ENHANCED
THE IMAGES AS BEST THEY COULD.

09:04.815 --> 09:08.048
(whoosh)

09:08.048 --> 09:10.020
SO NOW WE JUST
GOTTA FIGURE OUT

09:10.020 --> 09:13.123
WHY SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO HIT
AN ENGINEER FROM EL SEGUNDO.

09:13.123 --> 09:15.686
HAVE VREEDE GET
INTO PAROFSKY'S LIFE--

09:15.686 --> 09:19.890
FRIENDS, FAMILY,
BANK ACCOUNTS, WHATEVER.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

09:19.890 --> 09:23.664
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THAT EYEWITNESS?
UH. INGRID ALVAREZ.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.966
WE'LL BE TALKING TO HER.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.969
IF THE GUY IN HER VIDEO IS ONE
OF THE MEN I SAW IN MY VISION,

09:28.969 --> 09:33.003
THIS IS OUR BEST LEAD SO FAR--
OUR ONLY LEAD.

09:33.003 --> 09:35.205
I'M PUTTING HIM AWAY NOW.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.047
FIND OUT WHO SENT HIM

09:37.047 --> 09:40.951
AND MAKE SURE HE NEVER
SHOWS UP HERE ON APRIL 29th.

09:42.853 --> 09:47.287
AL SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO PROVE
WE COULD CHANGE THE FUTURE...

09:49.760 --> 09:51.762
SO LET'S CHANGE IT.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.070
(whoosh)

10:00.070 --> 10:02.232
HEY, HONEY.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.912
EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.043
HEY.
(tissue paper rustling)

10:13.043 --> 10:15.045
YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE BACK EARLY.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.317
YEAH.
(closing box)

10:17.317 --> 10:21.652
UH, MARK HAD
A W--A WORK THING.

10:21.652 --> 10:24.024
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.956
OH, THE USUAL.

10:25.956 --> 10:27.958
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GONE
THAT LONG.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.661
(crying)

10:33.834 --> 10:35.365
(screaming)

10:35.365 --> 10:39.009
(screams, wailing)

10:39.009 --> 10:40.310
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.312
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.746
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.078
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

10:48.078 --> 10:49.950
TRACY--
I'M SORRY.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.983
TR-TRACY! TRACE. TRACE.
(crying and whimpering)

10:52.983 --> 10:57.387
IT'S PATHETIC WAKING UP
EVERY DAMN MORNING LIKE THIS.

10:57.387 --> 10:58.859
(sniffles)

10:58.859 --> 11:02.092
MAYBE IF YOU'D
JUST TALK ABOUT IT...

11:02.092 --> 11:04.234
I TOLD YOU.

11:04.234 --> 11:06.997
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

11:06.997 --> 11:09.970
WELL, I'M NOT GIVING YOU
A CHOICE ANYMORE.

11:09.970 --> 11:13.073
I'VE BEEN GRIEVING FOR YOU

11:13.073 --> 11:15.675
FOR TWO YEARS, TRACE.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.308
HELL, I EVEN HAD--HAD YOUR GRAVE
EXHUMED TWO MONTHS AGO

11:18.308 --> 11:21.852
BECAUSE I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU WERE--YOU WERE ALIVE.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.093
(crying)

11:33.093 --> 11:36.396
IF YOU WANT TO
KEEP HIDING OUT HERE--

11:36.396 --> 11:39.970
IF YOU WANT ME TO PRETEND
TO THE WORLD, YOUR MOM INCLUDED,

11:39.970 --> 11:41.932
THAT YOU'RE STILL DEAD,

11:41.932 --> 11:44.074
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:46.376 --> 11:49.740
AFTER WHAT I SAW
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

11:49.740 --> 11:53.243
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.

11:53.243 --> 11:55.245
LISTEN TO ME, TRACE.
FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW,

11:55.245 --> 11:58.819
I'M GONNA BE SITTING
BY YOUR SIDE IN AFGHANISTAN.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.451
YOU SAW IT, AND I SAW IT.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.024
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU CAME HOME?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.495
OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT,

12:05.495 --> 12:07.858
I'M GONNA GET INVOLVED,
WH-WHATEVER IT IS.

12:07.858 --> 12:11.962
SO LET'S JUST CUT TO THE CHASE
AND GET STARTED.

12:11.962 --> 12:15.966
WE CAN DO THIS, TRACY.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.208
(Olivia)
HOW ABOUT THE SIMCOE BOY?

12:18.208 --> 12:21.041
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
DISCHARGED WHILE I WAS GONE.
NOT YET.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.043
HE WAS COMPLAINING
OF CALF PAIN,

12:23.043 --> 12:25.445
SO WE REMOVED THE CAST,
DID A DOPPLER,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.918
AND THE KID'S GOT A D.V.T.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

12:27.918 --> 12:30.480
MAN, I'M GOING
TO BE A GRANDMOTHER

12:30.480 --> 12:33.954
BEFORE THIS BOY GOES HOME.
I DON'T GET IT. WHY ARE YOU
SO ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIM?

12:33.954 --> 12:36.286
IS IT HIS DAD--MR. SIMCOE?

12:36.286 --> 12:38.829
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

12:38.829 --> 12:40.961
JUST THAT YOU GUYS HAVE
A WEIRD RELATIONSHIP.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.034
I MEAN, EVERY TIME HE COMES
AROUND, YOU GET CRAZY TENSE,

12:44.034 --> 12:46.236
AND--
DR. BENFORD?

12:46.236 --> 12:49.139
UH, ACTUALLY, DR. VARNEY JUST
TOLD ME ABOUT DYLAN'S STATUS.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.972
UH, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THE RAMIFICATIONS--
WOULD IT BE SAFE TO LEAVE
THE BOY'S BEDSIDE FOR A WHILE?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.374
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I SEE HERE THAT YOU HAVE HIM
ON HEPARIN.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.977
NOW THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS
AT THAT DOSE

12:56.977 --> 12:59.980
IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL.
IS THAT CORRECT?
I'M SORRY. AND YOU ARE?

12:59.980 --> 13:03.783
A GOOD QUESTION.
I'M A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.
FRANKLY, I WAS HOPING

13:03.783 --> 13:06.056
TO PRY LLOYD AWAY FROM
THE HOSPITAL FOR A WHILE--

13:06.056 --> 13:08.959
STEAK DINNER,
SOME FRATERNAL MARTINIS.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.961
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
SEE FIT TO SANCTION THAT?

13:10.961 --> 13:13.924
I MEAN, THE BOY IS ESSENTIALLY
READY TO BE DISCHARGED,

13:13.924 --> 13:16.366
IF I'VE READ
HIS CHART CORRECTLY.

13:16.366 --> 13:18.128
MAY I?

13:18.128 --> 13:20.130
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:24.034 --> 13:26.036
UH, YEAH.
BARRING ANY COMPLICATIONS,

13:26.036 --> 13:28.078
I SEE NO REASON WHY DYLAN
COULDN'T GO HOME

13:28.078 --> 13:30.510
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
WELL, IT'S SETTLED THEN.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.512
LLOYD, YOU'VE BEEN
ABSOLVED OF ANY GUILT,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.384
PARENTAL OR OTHERWISE.

13:34.384 --> 13:37.187
LOVELY.

13:37.187 --> 13:39.990
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.
MM-HMM.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.992
OF COURSE. DR. VARLEY.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.927
NICE LEGS.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.029
ARE YOU SLEEPING
WITH THAT WOMAN?

13:49.029 --> 13:51.101
THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN, SIMON.

13:51.101 --> 13:53.463
EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS MY CONCERN NOW,

13:53.463 --> 13:57.137
SINCE YOU PRESSED "SEND" ON
THAT IDIOTIC E-MAIL OF YOURS--

13:57.137 --> 14:00.040
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE PURPOSE
OF MY VISIT.

14:00.040 --> 14:05.145
I'M GOING PUBLIC WITH OR WITHOUT
MYHILL'S COOPERATION OR YOURS.
GOOD LUCK GETTING ANYONE
TO BELIEVE YOU WITHOUT IT.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.918
GOOD LUCK STOPPING ME.
WELL, IT APPEARS
WE'RE AT AN IMPASSE.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.849
THERE ARE TWO WAYS
TO SETTLE THIS.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.621
THE FIRST IS,
OH, SO TAWDRY AND PUBLIC.

14:11.621 --> 14:13.623
I MAKE A GENERAL ANNOYANCE
OUT OF MYSELF,

14:13.623 --> 14:17.127
KICK OVER AS MANY ANTHILLS
AS POSSIBLE--
ENOUGH, SIMON.

14:17.127 --> 14:20.130
OR WE SETTLE THIS
IN A MORE... CIVILIZED MANNER.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.531
DEFINE "CIVILIZED."

14:21.531 --> 14:24.194
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WE SETTLED
WHOSE NAME WOULD GO FIRST

14:24.194 --> 14:26.997
ON THE APPLICATION
FOR THE SLOAN FELLOWSHIP?

14:26.997 --> 14:29.069
TEXAS HOLD'EM,
NO HOLDS BARRED.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.642
YOU WIN, WE GO PUBLIC,
HANG OURSELVES OUT TO DRY.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.545
I WIN, YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
AND YOUR GUILT IN CHECK,

14:35.545 --> 14:39.049
AND WE BUY OURSELVES
SOME MORE TIME.
(scoffs) YOU WANT
TO WAGER THE FATE

14:39.049 --> 14:42.082
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON
THE OUTCOME OF A POKER GAME?

14:42.082 --> 14:45.055
THE GODS DID IT ALL THE TIME--
DICE, CHESS,

14:45.055 --> 14:48.018
WHATEVER TOOK THEIR FANCY.

14:48.018 --> 14:51.491
THEY LOVED TINKERING WITH
THE LIVES OF THOSE MERE MORTALS.
WE'RE NOT GODS, SIMON.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.294
20 MILLION DEATHS
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.127
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

14:57.127 --> 15:01.972
IF THAT DOESN'T QUALIFY US
FOR GODHOOD, TELL ME WHAT DOES.

15:01.972 --> 15:05.135
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.114
(siren wailing)

15:14.114 --> 15:16.416
(Demetri) HEY, WHAT'S
BARSTOW P.D. DOING HERE?

15:16.416 --> 15:20.050
(Mark) LET'S HOPE 3-STAR GUY
DIDN'T GET TO OUR WITNESS.

15:20.050 --> 15:25.155
DO YOU THINK
SHE DRIVES A GOLD SEDAN?

15:25.155 --> 15:27.597
MAYBE NOT ANYMORE.

15:27.597 --> 15:29.599
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

15:29.599 --> 15:31.701
SPECIAL AGENT BENFORD, FBI.

15:31.701 --> 15:34.134
DETECTIVE RICK MALCHIODI,
BARSTOW P.D.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.367
WE THINK YOUR VICTIM MIGHT BE
AN EYEWITNESS IN A HOMICIDE.

15:37.367 --> 15:40.040
THAT'S A HELL
OF A COINCIDENCE.
HOW'S THAT?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.973
HER ROOMMATE SAID
SHE WITNESSED A HOMICIDE, TOO.

15:42.973 --> 15:44.114
HER ROOMMATE?

15:44.114 --> 15:47.047
YEAH. UH, ALVAREZ...

15:47.047 --> 15:49.049
INGRID ALVAREZ.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.381
CAME HOME FROM WORK,
FOUND HER ROOMMATE THERE

15:51.381 --> 15:53.083
DOUBLE-TAPPED
TO THE SIDE OF HER HEAD.

15:53.083 --> 15:57.187
SO LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT
THE WRONG ROOMMATE, HUH?

15:59.289 --> 16:02.462
I BELIEVE IT'S TO YOU.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.595
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME THIS ROUND?

16:05.595 --> 16:09.139
$2,500.

16:09.139 --> 16:12.702
I HOPE YOU DON'T DRAG THIS GAME
OUT AS LONG AS THE LAST ONE.

16:21.311 --> 16:24.014
WHEN YOU LOSE, YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO CONSOLE YOURSELF

16:24.014 --> 16:26.586
THAT I'VE PREVENTED YOU FROM
CONFESSING TO A MASS MURDER.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.689
MANCHESTER FIGURE OF SPEECH.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.362
$2,500. I'LL CALL.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.199
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.072
YOU'RE SAYING
THEY KILLED BLANCA,

16:42.072 --> 16:45.535
BUT THEY WERE TRYING
TO KILL ME?
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
TO US, YES.

16:45.535 --> 16:48.638
AND IT'S BECAUSE
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ALLEY?

16:48.638 --> 16:52.142
NOW, INGRID, WHAT EXACTLY
DID HAPPEN IN THE ALLEY?

16:52.142 --> 16:55.485
WE HAVE THE VIDEO,
BUT IT WOULD REALLY HELP US

16:55.485 --> 16:58.017
TO GET YOUR ACCOUNT.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.790
I WAS WORKING LATE,
ME AND ONE OF MY CLERKS.

17:00.790 --> 17:05.425
CAN'T SAY I SEE YOU
AS A BLONDE, MS. ALVAREZ.
AND I CAN'T SEE YOU
AS A ROCK STAR,

17:05.425 --> 17:08.528
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
YOUR VISION WAS.
(Ingrid) I WAS LOCKING UP
FOR THE NIGHT.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.530
YOU WANT ME TO WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR?

17:10.530 --> 17:13.063
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LATE.
I'LL BE FINE.

17:13.063 --> 17:16.166
I WENT TO MY CAR, BUT THERE
WERE MEN IN THE ALLEY--

17:16.166 --> 17:18.668
THREE OF THEM.
THEY WERE FIGHTING, ARGUING,

17:18.668 --> 17:21.811
BUT I COULDN'T HEAR WHAT ABOUT.
(man) I SAID, WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS HE?

17:21.811 --> 17:24.574
(man grunts)
BUT WHEN IT GOT PHYSICAL,
I HID.

17:24.574 --> 17:28.118
(speaking indistinctly)

17:28.118 --> 17:30.720
I CALLED 9-1-1,
BUT THEY PUT ME ON HOLD.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.124
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
I STAYED CALM ENOUGH

17:34.124 --> 17:36.226
TO THINK TO USE MY PHONE.

17:36.226 --> 17:38.528
NO! PLEASE DON'T!
(bang)

17:38.528 --> 17:41.161
(dog barking)
MY HAND WAS SHAKING SO MUCH.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.234
(crying)

17:44.234 --> 17:47.197
NOW YOU TOLD THE POLICE

17:47.197 --> 17:49.739
THE VICTIM GAVE
THE OTHER MEN SOMETHING

17:49.739 --> 17:51.701
RIGHT BEFORE THEY SHOT HIM?

17:51.701 --> 17:55.074
(Ingrid) THEY WERE ARGUING
ABOUT A CASE OR SOMETHING.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076
BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHAT IT WAS.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.709
WHAT ABOUT THE FACES
OF THE OTHER MEN?

17:59.709 --> 18:03.353
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
DESCRIBE THEM?
I DIDN'T GET A VERY GOOD LOOK,

18:03.353 --> 18:05.855
BUT I THINK ONE OF THEM
MAYBE HAD GRAY HAIR.

18:05.855 --> 18:08.658
THE OTHER ONE WAS BALD,
AND HE WAS BIG, MUSCULAR.

18:08.658 --> 18:10.490
IT WAS VERY DARK.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.823
WE'RE GONNA SIT YOU DOWN WITH
A SKETCH ARTIST, ALL RIGHT?

18:13.823 --> 18:15.795
WHATEVER YOU CAN GIVE US.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.097
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN REMEMBER,

18:18.097 --> 18:21.371
IT COULD BE A BIG HELP,
OKAY?

18:22.832 --> 18:24.834
AS THEY WERE WALKING AWAY,

18:24.834 --> 18:27.437
THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

18:27.437 --> 18:30.340
UH, IT SOUNDED LIKE "Q.E.D."

18:31.881 --> 18:34.744
(Mark) THANK YOU.

18:46.196 --> 18:49.529
Y'ALL EVER READ ABOUT THAT
INEVITABILITY INDEX THING

18:49.529 --> 18:51.901
THAT'S BEEN IN ALL THE PAPERS?

18:51.901 --> 18:53.663
$5,000.
(chips clink)

18:53.663 --> 18:55.765
IT'S A SCAM--

18:55.765 --> 18:58.838
SOME ENTREPRENEURIAL HUCKSTER'S
ATTEMPT TO SELL US ON THE IDEA

18:58.838 --> 19:01.671
THAT THE ODDS OF THE FUTURE
HAPPENING CAN BE "CALCULATED."

19:01.671 --> 19:04.244
IT'S ALL RUBBISH.
FATE IS FATE.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.316
WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE,
LLOYD.

19:06.316 --> 19:09.148
WHAT ABOUT FREE WILL?
NO SUCH THING.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.853
OH, SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A HARD DETERMINIST?
SIMPLE QUANTUM SUICIDE THEORY.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.187
I WILL WIN THIS HAND
AND EVERY SUBSEQUENT HAND

19:17.187 --> 19:19.489
WE PLAY AD INFINITUM.
Q.E.D.

19:19.489 --> 19:22.432
DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF HEARING
YOURSELF PONTIFICATE?

19:22.432 --> 19:25.495
DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF BEING
A SELF-RIGHTEOUS PRIG?

19:25.495 --> 19:27.497
WE'RE SCIENTISTS, LLOYD,
NOT ATTENTION-SEEKING

19:27.497 --> 19:29.839
REALITY SHOW CONTESTANTS
LOOKING

19:29.839 --> 19:32.572
FOR THEIR 15 MINUTES
OF FAME ON A TALK SHOW.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.875
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.
WHAT'S THAT?

19:35.875 --> 19:40.179
USE INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENT
TO DEFEND YOUR BEHAVIOR.
WHAT?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.212
OKAY, SO YOU SLEEP
WITH CABRINI'S WIFE,

19:42.212 --> 19:44.214
AND YOU CALL IT
ELECTROMAGNETISM.

19:44.214 --> 19:47.417
YOU FIRE YOUR ASSISTANT
AND BLAME IT ON DARWIN.
SHUT UP, LLOYD.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.260
AND NOW YOU'VE UPENDED
THE ENTIRE WORLD,

19:50.260 --> 19:54.364
AND YOU HIDE BEHIND
DETERMINIST RHETORIC.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S LOST SOMEONE, LLOYD.

19:54.364 --> 19:57.267
OH, WHO, SIMON?
WHO HAVE YOU EVER CARED ABOUT?

19:57.267 --> 19:59.529
I'LL CALL.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.712
YOU SEE, I KNEW YOU WERE
BLUFFING THIS ENTIRE TIME.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.514
YOU KNOW WHY?

20:14.514 --> 20:18.388
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS LUCK OR FATE

20:18.388 --> 20:20.890
OR "THERE BUT FOR
THE GRACE OF GOD."

20:20.890 --> 20:24.254
THIS GAME IS POINTLESS.
I'VE ALREADY WON.

20:24.254 --> 20:26.896
(whoosh)
THE FUTURE'S
ALREADY HAPPENED.

20:26.896 --> 20:29.599
FIGHTING IT IS FUTILE.

20:29.599 --> 20:31.731
HEY, NICOLE.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.433
NICOLE?

20:33.433 --> 20:36.005
HEY. YOU OKAY?

20:36.005 --> 20:37.937
SORRY.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.010
MIND WANDERED.
(whoosh)

20:41.010 --> 20:42.872
I'M GUESSING MARK
TOLD YOU WHAT I SAW.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.744
HE DID, YEAH,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.916
BUT ONLY 'CAUSE
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.017
WE BOTH ARE.

20:48.017 --> 20:52.922
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

20:52.922 --> 20:55.525
THE FUTURE CAN CHANGE.
IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

20:55.525 --> 20:58.428
HEY, CRAZY-HUGE FLORAL DELIVERY
FOR THE QUINTUPLETS.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.990
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

21:00.990 --> 21:02.892
GO, GO, GO.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.498
DON'T WORRY, OLIVIA. YOU KNOW,
WE CAN CHANGE WHAT WE SAW,

21:08.498 --> 21:10.840
JUST LIKE WE COULD
BEFORE THE BLACKOUT.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.872
EVERYTHING'S BACK
TO BEING UP TO US AGAIN.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.548
DAD.

21:25.985 --> 21:29.919
MY HUMVEE GOT ATTACKED.

21:29.919 --> 21:31.691
YEAH.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.693
YOUR FRIEND MIKE
TOLD ME THAT.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.295
BUT THAT WAS
TWO YEARS AGO, TRACY.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.728
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
BACK TO YOUR BASE?

21:38.728 --> 21:40.029
I COULDN'T. THE ATTACK--

21:40.029 --> 21:42.972
WE WERE FIRED ON
BY SUPPOSED FRIENDLIES.

21:42.972 --> 21:44.374
MARINES?

21:44.374 --> 21:47.577
JERICHO P.M.C.--
PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTORS.

21:47.577 --> 21:50.780
YEAH, I'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM,
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.782
JERICHO WORKS
FOR THE MILITARY,

21:52.782 --> 21:55.815
WHICH MEANS THAT I CAN'T
TRUST THE MILITARY--
WHOA, HOLD ON A SECOND.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.988
W-WHY WOULD YOU SAY
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE MILITARY?

21:58.988 --> 22:02.492
ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE
MY HUMVEE WAS ATTACKED,

22:02.492 --> 22:05.825
I WAS WORKING
LONG-RANGE RECON

22:05.825 --> 22:08.998
ON THIS VILLAGE
IN THE FOOTHILLS NEAR KUNAR.

22:08.998 --> 22:11.000
I WAS ALONE.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.933
ORDERS WERE TO STAY COVERT
SO THE LOCALS WOULDN'T SEE ME.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.766
BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE.

22:16.766 --> 22:17.907
JERICHO.

22:21.010 --> 22:23.012
AND I WATCHED THEM...

22:26.075 --> 22:30.980
I WATCHED AS THEY
WIPED OUT A VILLAGE.

22:30.980 --> 22:34.384
THEY KILLED WOMEN,

22:34.384 --> 22:36.886
AND THEY BUTCHERED CHILDREN.

22:36.886 --> 22:38.888
THEY SLAUGHTERED THEM.

22:38.888 --> 22:41.631
WHY? WHY WOULD THEY
WANT TO DO THAT?

22:41.631 --> 22:44.033
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I TOLD
MY SUPERIOR OFFICER,

22:44.033 --> 22:46.836
AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER,
MIKE AND I PULLED DUTY

22:46.836 --> 22:49.999
AT A FORWARD ROADBLOCK
NEAR THE KALIKATA MOUNTAINS.

22:49.999 --> 22:52.602
OUT OF NOWHERE, A HAJI TRUCK
BREACHED OUR ROADBLOCK.

22:52.602 --> 22:55.144
WE TOOK OFF AFTER THEM.

22:55.144 --> 22:56.375
DAMN!

22:56.375 --> 22:59.409
EMBRACE THE SUCK, STARK.

22:59.409 --> 23:00.910
(laughs)

23:00.910 --> 23:03.853
(tires screech)

23:03.853 --> 23:06.015
(man)
WAIT. WHO ARE THEY?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.889
BURRO, BURRO!
WE'RE GONNA GET WHACKED!

23:09.889 --> 23:13.463
GET OUT!

23:13.463 --> 23:14.964
(screams)

23:26.936 --> 23:29.709
(Tracy)
I DON'T KNOW HOW I SURVIVED.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.781
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE.

23:31.781 --> 23:33.883
(whimpers)

23:33.883 --> 23:36.145
(crying)

23:52.431 --> 23:54.704
(screams)

24:08.217 --> 24:11.050
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.022
YOU SOUNDED A LITTLE FREAKED
WHEN YOU CALLED.

24:13.022 --> 24:16.656
DID YOU SLIP OR SOMETHING?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.128
JUST, UH, I, UH...

24:19.128 --> 24:21.831
LOOK,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

24:21.831 --> 24:24.594
I TOOK THIS PICTURE
AT MY HOUSE.

24:28.037 --> 24:31.841
(whispering)
OH... MY... GOD.

24:31.841 --> 24:35.044
IT'S TRACY.

24:35.044 --> 24:38.477
(normal voice) HOW?
HOW? (stammers)

24:38.477 --> 24:41.511
TRACY WOULD KILL ME IF SHE
KNEW I WAS TALKING TO YOU,

24:41.511 --> 24:45.815
BUT SHE WAS--SHE WAS IN A HUMVEE
WITH THREE OTHER SOLDIERS.

24:45.815 --> 24:47.987
IT GOT BLOWN TO HELL,
A BLOODY MESS--

24:47.987 --> 24:51.220
BODY PARTS EVERYWHERE,
INCLUDING HER LEG.

24:51.220 --> 24:54.123
THE D.N.A...
RIGHT.

24:54.123 --> 24:56.926
IT GOT BASICALLY
THROWN INTO THE MIX.
THEN WHERE HAS SHE--

24:56.926 --> 25:00.700
WH-WHAT HAS SHE BEEN DOING
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS?
THIS IS WHAT I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.132
BASICALLY,
SHE'S BEEN ON THE RUN.

25:03.132 --> 25:05.805
SHE SAW SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE

25:05.805 --> 25:08.938
AND GOT IN TROUBLE
WITH JERICHO. THEY'RE THIS--
YEAH, MILITARY CONTRACTORS.

25:08.938 --> 25:13.142
YEAH. THEY WERE THE ONES
WHO ATTACKED HER.

25:13.142 --> 25:15.114
I-I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
LIKE SOMETHING

25:15.114 --> 25:17.286
OUT OF A BALDACCI NOVEL
OR SOMETHING,

25:17.286 --> 25:19.849
BUT... TRACY WAS DEAD,

25:19.849 --> 25:21.851
AND NOW SHE'S ALIVE.

25:21.851 --> 25:25.024
SO I, UH, I REALLY NEED
YOUR HELP, MARK,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.526
'CAUSE TRACY IS SCARED
TO DEATH OF THESE JERICHO GUYS,

25:27.526 --> 25:30.229
AND I'M AFRAID THEY'RE
GONNA TRY TO FIND HER.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.862
YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:32.862 --> 25:34.964
YEAH.

25:34.964 --> 25:38.768
I SAW SOMETHING TODAY,
AND IT GOT ME THINKING

25:38.768 --> 25:43.012
THAT IF THIS PERSON'S FUTURE
COULD COME TRUE--

25:43.012 --> 25:45.915
AND IT DID,

25:45.915 --> 25:48.618
EVEN THOUGH
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE--

25:48.618 --> 25:50.650
THEN MAYBE THESE VISIONS

25:50.650 --> 25:55.024
ARE MORE SET IN STONE
THAN WE THOUGHT.
OR MAYBE WE HAVE TO WORK
THAT MUCH HARDER.

25:55.024 --> 25:57.026
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:57.026 --> 26:00.660
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.192
(sighs)

26:07.737 --> 26:10.039
HEY, DID YOU OPEN MY GIFT?

26:10.039 --> 26:12.241
OH. THEY'RE LOVELY.

26:12.241 --> 26:14.874
YOU DIDN'T PUT 'EM ON?

26:14.874 --> 26:17.747
I FIGURED YOU'D JUST
TAKE 'EM RIGHT OFF AGAIN.

26:17.747 --> 26:20.079
RIGHT. (chuckles)

26:20.079 --> 26:22.952
WE CAN CHANGE THINGS,
MARK.

26:22.952 --> 26:27.086
WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE
HOW BADLY WE WANT TO,

26:27.086 --> 26:31.020
HOW FAR WE'RE WILLING
TO GO TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.062
BUT I SAY THERE'S NOTHING,

26:33.062 --> 26:37.767
NOTHING THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE
WILLING TO DO FOR ONE ANOTHER.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.999
(Wedeck) SO WHAT
ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

26:39.999 --> 26:42.702
SET A TRAP FOR OUR SUSPECTS,

26:42.702 --> 26:44.033
DRAW 'EM OUT.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.035
I KNOW A LOT'S CHANGED
LATELY,

26:46.035 --> 26:48.908
BUT WE STILL DON'T USE
CIVILIANS AS BAIT.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.180
INGRID KNOWS THE RISKS.

26:51.180 --> 26:54.984
THEN WORK THE CASE. WORK--
WORK THE--THE PAROFSKY ANGLE.
WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT.

26:54.984 --> 26:59.889
PAROFSKY WAS CHIEF ENGINEER
AT MICRO-CIRCADIAN ELECTRONICS.
HE WAS RECENTLY LET GO

26:59.889 --> 27:01.620
ON SUSPICION
OF CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.054
WHAT IF PAROFSKY IS SELLING
HIS WORK TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER?

27:05.054 --> 27:07.126
INGRID DID SAY THAT
THEY TOOK A PACKAGE FROM HIM

27:07.126 --> 27:10.760
RIGHT BEFORE THEY SHOT HIM.
SO WHATEVER WAS IN THERE WAS
VALUABLE ENOUGH TO KILL FOR.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.003
LOOK, STAN, IT'S A REAL LEAD.
INGRID'S GONNA BE PROTECTED

27:14.003 --> 27:17.236
ON THIS, I PROMISE.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THEY'D TRY TO HIT HER TONIGHT?

27:17.236 --> 27:19.769
THEY ALREADY TRIED
TO KILL INGRID ONCE.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.771
IF WE GET THE WORD OUT

27:21.771 --> 27:24.914
THAT WE'RE RELEASING HER FROM
CUSTODY, THEY MIGHT TRY AGAIN.

27:24.914 --> 27:26.946
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

27:26.946 --> 27:30.379
WE WENT TO UTAH.
D. GIBBONS KNEW WE WERE COMING.

27:30.379 --> 27:32.281
YOU UNEARTHED
THE SOMALIA PHOTOS.

27:32.281 --> 27:34.754
FIVE MINUTES LATER
WE'RE GETTING SHOT AT.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.085
WHOEVER WE'RE INVESTIGATING

27:36.085 --> 27:38.728
KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DOING
BEFORE WE DO IT.

27:38.728 --> 27:41.390
YOU THINK WE'VE GOT A MOLE.

27:41.390 --> 27:44.063
WE... HAVE A MOLE.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.036
TWO MEN WITH ASSAULT RIFLES ARE
GONNA GET INTO THIS BUILDING

27:47.036 --> 27:50.970
FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW,
AND SOMEONE'S GONNA LET 'EM IN.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.042
WE CATCH THESE GUYS TONIGHT,

27:53.042 --> 27:56.105
WE CAN FINALLY PUT A FACE
ON OUR ENEMY.

28:04.253 --> 28:07.787
(blows) CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.

28:10.259 --> 28:13.092
GUESS THERE'S NO CHANCE OF
GETTING ANY BOURBON IN THERE.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.065
PROBABLY NOT A GOOD ONE,
NO.

28:17.727 --> 28:21.771
WHEN DID YOU START
DRINKIN' WHISKEY, ANYWAY?

28:24.033 --> 28:26.005
I TOLD MARK BENFORD.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.706
YOU WHAT?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.339
HE CAN HELP.
ARE YOU INSANE?

28:30.339 --> 28:32.942
YOU DON'T KNOW
THESE PEOPLE, DAD.

28:32.942 --> 28:36.986
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

28:36.986 --> 28:39.819
I CAME TO THIS HOUSE
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT

28:39.819 --> 28:42.792
THAT I'D BE SAFE, BUT I SEE NOW
THAT THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.895
MARK'S A FED, TRACE. I MEAN,
HE'S--HE'S PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

28:45.895 --> 28:48.027
THE SECOND THAT JERICHO KNOWS
THAT I'M STILL ALIVE,

28:48.027 --> 28:49.999
THEY'LL FIND ME,
AND THEY'LL KILL ME.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.962
THAT'S NOT TRUE. DON'T YOU
REMEMBER YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

28:52.962 --> 28:55.835
THE FACT THAT
YOU EVEN HAD ONE

28:55.835 --> 28:58.067
PROVES THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALIVE.
(whoosh)

28:58.067 --> 29:00.269
I WAS WITH YOU.
I-I GAVE YOU MY POCKET KNIFE.

29:00.269 --> 29:02.741
YOU WERE ON A COT,
FELL ASLEEP.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.444
WE WERE IN SOME KIND OF BUNKER
OR CAVE SURROUNDED BY GUARDS,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.917
AND THERE WAS GRAFFITI
ALL OVER THE WALLS.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.880
I THINK SOMEBODY
WAS CALLING MY NAME.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.452
THEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.184
THERE WAS A MAN OUT THERE.

29:15.184 --> 29:17.486
HE WAS VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

29:17.486 --> 29:19.929
HE SAID SOMETHING STRANGE...
THE ACCOUNT
HAS BEEN VERIFIED.

29:19.929 --> 29:22.131
THEN I GAVE HIM AN ENVELOPE,

29:22.131 --> 29:25.935
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WAS IN IT.

29:25.935 --> 29:27.937
"THE ACCOUNTS
HAVE BEEN VERIFIED."

29:27.937 --> 29:29.939
DOES THAT MEAN SOMETHING
TO YOU?

29:29.939 --> 29:32.942
NO. BUT THIS GUY, WHAT DID--
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

29:32.942 --> 29:34.773
TALL, DARK. SCAR.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.946
KHAMIR.
(whoosh)

29:36.946 --> 29:41.080
KHAMIR DEJAN. HE WAS
A FIELD MEDIC WITH THE I.M.C.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.082
HE--HE TOOK CARE OF ME.

29:43.082 --> 29:46.455
HE...
HE GOT ME BACK TOGETHER.

29:46.455 --> 29:49.018
THAT'S WHY I LEFT.

29:49.018 --> 29:52.361
I WAS SO AFRAID THAT JERICHO
WOULD KILL KHAMIR TO GET TO ME.

29:52.361 --> 29:55.194
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW HE'S ALIVE.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.366
I SAW HIM. ALL THREE OF US
WERE THERE, TRACE.

29:57.366 --> 30:01.300
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
THAT EVERYTHING WE SAW

30:01.300 --> 30:04.173
WILL STILL COME TRUE?
ENOUGH OF MINE
HAS COME TRUE ALREADY

30:04.173 --> 30:08.107
THAT I'M A BELIEVER.
YOU CAME BACK TO ME, TRACE.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.179
DIDN'T YOU?

30:10.179 --> 30:13.312
I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD DRAG US
BOTH BACK TO AFGHANISTAN,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.915
BUT I HAVE TO TRUST
WHAT I SAW.

30:17.917 --> 30:22.521
(birds squawking)

30:22.521 --> 30:24.823
(man) Everything
looks good out here.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.395
(beep)
ROGER THAT.

30:26.395 --> 30:28.397
All units, stay on Tact-2.

30:28.397 --> 30:30.960
These guys are pros--

30:30.960 --> 30:33.102
former military,
based on that video we saw.

30:33.102 --> 30:35.564
(birds chirping
and squawking)

30:35.564 --> 30:39.108
INGRID, YOU HAVE
A LOT OF AMAZING BIRDS.

30:39.108 --> 30:41.971
MY BABIES--THE ONLY
REAL FAMILY I'VE EVER HAD.

30:41.971 --> 30:44.373
EACH ONE OF THEM
IS SPECIAL TO ME.

30:44.373 --> 30:48.247
(kisses) IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE I
EVER THOUGHT OF GIVING THEM UP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:48.247 --> 30:50.079
MY FLASH-FORWARD.

30:50.079 --> 30:51.951
(whoosh)

30:51.951 --> 30:55.054
IN MY VISION, I WASN'T WORKING
AT THE STORE ANYMORE.

30:55.054 --> 30:58.187
I HAD BLONDE HAIR,
AND I WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK.

30:58.187 --> 31:01.290
SO THE NEXT DAY,
I PUT IT UP FOR SALE.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.292
WELL,
SINCE WE'RE STANDING HERE,

31:03.292 --> 31:05.634
I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF BUYERS.

31:05.634 --> 31:07.997
IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST.

31:07.997 --> 31:09.999
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING--

31:09.999 --> 31:12.001
PLANNING ON CHANGING
MY LIFE FOR A FUTURE

31:12.001 --> 31:14.974
THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN
COME TRUE.

31:14.974 --> 31:18.607
(yawns)

31:18.607 --> 31:21.080
WE KEEPING YOU AWAKE,
CUPCAKE?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.152
(chuckles) I'M SORRY, MAN.

31:23.152 --> 31:25.654
I WAS UP LATE
WITH ZOEY LAST NIGHT.
OH?

31:25.654 --> 31:27.616
I TOLD HER
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME--

31:27.616 --> 31:30.419
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME--
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TO ME.

31:32.461 --> 31:35.024
SHE WANTS ME TO QUIT,

31:35.024 --> 31:37.296
GET OUT OF THE LINE
OF FIRE, I GUESS.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.298
ARE YOU...
THINKING ABOUT IT?

31:39.298 --> 31:41.300
I WASN'T.

31:41.300 --> 31:45.304
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS? I QUIT,
I GET HIT BY A BUS, RIGHT?

31:45.304 --> 31:48.107
THAT'S MY LUCK.
WHATEVER, RIGHT?

31:48.107 --> 31:50.109
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

31:50.109 --> 31:53.082
BECOME A BARISTA
UNTIL MY DATE WITH DEATH?

31:53.082 --> 31:56.085
THAT'S ONE WAY TO GO.

31:58.447 --> 32:02.121
WHEN THIS IS OVER,
WHETHER IT'S TONIGHT OR LATER,

32:02.121 --> 32:05.054
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO HAVE
ONE OF MY COCKATIELS.

32:05.054 --> 32:06.996
OH, NO, NO.

32:06.996 --> 32:09.058
A THANK YOU GIFT.
DON'T MAKE ME INSIST.

32:09.058 --> 32:13.132
INGRID, IF YOU TRULY
LOVE YOUR BIRDS,

32:13.132 --> 32:16.035
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT TO GIVE
ONE TO ME, BUT THANK YOU.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.606
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

32:17.606 --> 32:18.667
(loud bang)

32:18.667 --> 32:22.071
WHAT WAS THAT?
STAY HERE.

32:22.071 --> 32:25.274
SABRE-2, THIS IS SABRE-1.

32:25.274 --> 32:27.216
(beep)
SABRE-2, GO.

32:27.216 --> 32:29.618
THINK I MAY HAVE
SOME MOVEMENT HERE.

32:29.618 --> 32:32.951
(beep)
YOU WANT US TO MOVE IN
ON YOUR POSITION?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.285
COULD BE NOTHING.
LET ME CHECK IT OUT FIRST.

32:36.285 --> 32:39.128
(lights clank)

32:39.128 --> 32:41.530
SABRE-2,
WE HAVE A BREACH.

32:41.530 --> 32:44.633
SABRE-2--ALL UNITS, SURROUND
THE PERIMETER! NOBODY GETS OUT!

32:44.633 --> 32:47.036
MARK, I GOT INGRID
COVERED IN THE BACK.

33:12.161 --> 33:14.063
(whoosh)

33:24.103 --> 33:26.105
(whoosh)

33:36.115 --> 33:37.716
(whoosh)

33:50.199 --> 33:52.101
FREEZE! MARK!
(gunshot)

33:59.138 --> 34:01.810
(birds squawking)

34:11.780 --> 34:15.084
YOU SAW HIM TURNING ON ME.

34:15.084 --> 34:16.825
HE WAS MAKIN' A MOVE.

34:19.088 --> 34:22.131
IT WAS DARK.

34:22.131 --> 34:24.563
I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK.

34:24.563 --> 34:28.337
BUT I DO KNOW WE CAN'T
INTERROGATE A DEAD MAN.

34:30.599 --> 34:34.603
(camera shutter clicking)

34:34.603 --> 34:38.107
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

34:38.107 --> 34:42.351
WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?
I'M SORRY,

34:42.351 --> 34:44.813
BUT ONE OF THE MEN YOU SAW
IS STILL OUT THERE,

34:44.813 --> 34:48.717
AND HE'S NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL HE FINDS YOU.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.423
WE NEED TO PUT YOU
IN WITNESS PROTECTION.

34:54.423 --> 34:58.367
THAT'S OKAY.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.569
I THINK THAT'S MY FUTURE.

35:00.569 --> 35:04.373
I SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED
MY GUT ALL ALONG.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.877
JUDGING FROM YOUR DWINDLING
AMOUNT OF CHIPS,

35:08.877 --> 35:11.840
THE PAIN IS ALMOST OVER.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.629
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
OVER THERE, MATE?

35:30.629 --> 35:34.703
MAYBE YOU GOT A PAIR OF 8s,
WORKING A FULL BOAT.

35:34.703 --> 35:36.805
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

35:36.805 --> 35:39.238
JUST UNDER 15.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.174
$5,000.
(chips clink)

35:49.248 --> 35:51.480
THANK YOU.
(ice rattling)

36:03.532 --> 36:06.235
WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS HAND
WINNER TAKE ALL?

36:06.235 --> 36:08.237
IF YOU WIN, WE GO PUBLIC.

36:08.237 --> 36:11.670
BUT OF COURSE I'LL WIN,
AND YOU'LL KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
FINE.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.215
AS A PHYSICIST, LLOYD,

36:26.215 --> 36:28.257
YOU REALLY ARE A GENIUS.

36:28.257 --> 36:31.890
BUT YOU WERE NEVER VERY GOOD
AT CONCEALING YOUR TELLS.

36:31.890 --> 36:35.524
(whispers) OUCH.

36:35.524 --> 36:37.526
(man) FOUR OF A KIND
FOR MR. CAMPOS.

36:48.877 --> 36:50.439
STRAIGHT FLUSH.

36:50.439 --> 36:54.243
POT AND GAME TO MR. SIMCOE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:54.243 --> 36:57.286
(chips clatter)
KEEP THE CHIPS.

36:57.286 --> 36:59.518
CALL IT A TIP.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.891
I GOT WHAT I CAME FOR.

37:02.891 --> 37:05.223
HOW DID YOU BEAT ME?

37:05.223 --> 37:08.897
DID I TELL YOU DYLAN
REALLY LOVES MAGIC?

37:08.897 --> 37:12.601
SLEIGHT OF HAND'S
HIS FAVORITE.

37:12.601 --> 37:15.434
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
EVEN I WON'T LEAVE TO CHANCE.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.337
THAT BEING SAID,
I'LL LET YOU HAVE THE FIRST PASS

37:18.337 --> 37:21.840
AT DRAFTING THE ANNOUNCEMENT,
ALL RIGHT?

37:23.972 --> 37:27.946
THANKS FOR BACKING
MY PLAY THERE.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.649
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW WHICH PLAY IT WAS.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.521
(door closes)

37:32.521 --> 37:34.823
IS THIS ABOUT TAKING
TATTOO MAN OFF THE STREETS

37:34.823 --> 37:37.626
OR PUTTING HIM UNDER IT?
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:37.626 --> 37:39.958
LOOK, I KNOW YOU SAID
IF WE GET THIS GUY,

37:39.958 --> 37:43.732
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CHANGE OUR FUTURES.
BUT?

37:43.732 --> 37:47.896
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE PLAN HERE ISN'T TO KILL HIM

37:47.896 --> 37:51.570
SO HE CAN'T KILL ME OR COME
AFTER YOU IN YOUR OFFICE.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.672
WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

37:53.672 --> 37:55.674
BECAUSE I HAD IT.

37:57.846 --> 38:00.579
THE SECOND YOU SUGGESTED
TATTOO MAN MIGHT BE THE GUY

38:00.579 --> 38:02.581
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO KILL ME,

38:02.581 --> 38:04.853
I THOUGHT,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM FIRST.

38:04.853 --> 38:09.958
BUT NOW YOU THINK
I ACTUALLY DID...

38:09.958 --> 38:12.861
THAT I WENT THAT FAR.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.866
I WOULD'VE.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.806
(door closes)

38:34.012 --> 38:36.014
(Wedeck) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE SO LATE?

38:36.014 --> 38:37.986
TRUSTING MY GUT.

38:37.986 --> 38:39.518
HMM.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.591
(chuckles)

38:42.591 --> 38:45.023
YOUR E-MAIL SAID
YOU HAD SOMETHING FOR ME.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.025
YEAH, I DO.
(typing, computer beeps)

38:47.025 --> 38:49.027
N.S.A. FINALLY SENT BACK

38:49.027 --> 38:51.600
A NEW RENDERING
OF THAT SUSPECT ZERO PHOTO.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.362
HMM. LOOKS LIKE THE OLD ONE.

38:53.362 --> 38:56.965
IT IS. THIS... IS THE NEW ONE.
(beeping)

38:59.337 --> 39:02.340
WHAT'S THAT ON HIS HAND?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.942
(types, beep)

39:03.942 --> 39:06.445
(beep)
IT LOOKS LIKE A RING.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.747
MM-HMM. CAN THE IMAGE
BE ENHANCED ANY FURTHER?

39:08.747 --> 39:10.779
N.S.A. IS WORKING ON IT
RIGHT NOW,

39:10.779 --> 39:13.782
BUT IT TOOK THEM THIS LONG
TO GET THIS FAR.
(typing)

39:13.782 --> 39:15.824
TELL THEM TO
PUT THEIR FOOT ON THE GAS.

39:15.824 --> 39:18.627
IF WE CAN TIE THIS JEWELRY
TO THE GUY WEARING IT,

39:18.627 --> 39:21.359
WE'LL HAVE OUR FIRST
WORKABLE LEAD.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.691
GOOD JOB.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.736
(typing)

39:33.402 --> 39:35.674
HEY.

39:39.007 --> 39:40.709
(locks door)

39:45.454 --> 39:48.957
WOW. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAD
A PERFECTLY ORDINARY DAY.

39:48.957 --> 39:50.889
(keys jangle)

39:50.889 --> 39:53.492
WORSE THAN ORDINARY?

39:53.492 --> 39:55.494
MARK?

39:55.494 --> 39:58.997
I KILLED A MAN TONIGHT.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.699
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:00.699 --> 40:04.172
I HAD A SHOT
AT CHANGING MY FUTURE...

40:06.875 --> 40:08.737
CHANGING OUR FUTURE...

40:11.440 --> 40:13.411
AND I TOOK IT.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.644
OH, MARK.

40:15.644 --> 40:17.646
COME HERE.

40:17.646 --> 40:19.788
COME HERE.

40:19.788 --> 40:23.952
MAYBE APRIL 29th's JUST GONNA BE
ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE NOW.

40:25.954 --> 40:27.896
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:27.896 --> 40:30.959
I, UH...

40:30.959 --> 40:34.963
I TOLD YOU IN MY FLASH-FORWARD
I WAS IN DANGER, RIGHT?

40:34.963 --> 40:38.166
A MAN WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.

40:38.166 --> 40:40.138
(whispers) BUT TONIGHT...

40:40.138 --> 40:42.210
(normal voice)
I GOT TO HIM FIRST.

40:45.914 --> 40:48.076
(whispering)
I CHANGED THE FUTURE, LIVY.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.851
WE HAVE A SECOND CHANCE.

40:52.851 --> 40:57.686
WE HAVE A SECOND CHANCE.

40:57.686 --> 41:00.759
(thunder rumbling)

41:07.936 --> 41:09.638
HEY.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.913
(lightning crashes,
thunder rumbles)

41:34.022 --> 41:36.064
YOU HAVE THEM?

41:47.005 --> 41:50.839
THERE WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE SEVEN.

41:56.885 --> 41:59.117
AFTER THE FIRST
ATOM BOMB TEST,

41:59.117 --> 42:02.991
YOU KNOW WHAT A COLLEAGUE
OF OPPENHEIMER'S SAID?

42:02.991 --> 42:05.724
"WHAT A FOUL
AND AWESOME DISPLAY."

42:05.724 --> 42:09.658
HE THEN ADDED, "NOW WE ARE ALL
SONS OF BITCHES."
