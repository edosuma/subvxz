00:48.423 --> 00:51.510
[heavy breathing]

00:54.846 --> 00:56.265
I just met Ethan.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.809
I think it was for the last time.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.562
You know,
Lisa told me they're starting IVF,

01:01.645 --> 01:04.189
so Ethan and I
have to stop seeing each other.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.484
[therapist] So is this why you wanted
to start therapy today?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.320
No! That has nothing to do with it.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.699
But I can see how
you would make that connection.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.326
So, Lisa is a friend of yours
from college, as well?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.579
Jesus Christ, you're as bad as my husband.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.164
Does he forget things
that are important to you?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.333
That is not the point!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.419
Do you want me to write down the names?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.004
I think I'm following.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.716
You are worried
about being fair to Lisa, wife of Ethan.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.633
Yes.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.761
Because you're imagining Lisa
will be especially vulnerable

01:34.845 --> 01:38.307
after the birth of her first child
with her husband, Ethan.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.809
I'm not imagining it!
She'll have just had a baby!

01:40.892 --> 01:43.395
Her vagina's going to be a Superfund site.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.523
Dr Stone didn't say anything
about you being pregnant.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.359
That shouldn't affect anything between us.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.322
So what's preventing you
from cutting off this affair?

01:53.405 --> 01:55.490
You seem pretty determined.

01:56.658 --> 02:01.079
I don't know. You know, he was the first
person I was ever madly attracted to.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.582
And it's as strong now
as it was when I was 19

02:03.665 --> 02:05.334
and he was this...

02:06.001 --> 02:08.086
magnetic, confident,

02:08.170 --> 02:11.548
hilarious, brilliant, gorgeous kid.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.761
I get a rush whenever I'm around him
and then I make terrible choices.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.472
But maybe that's part of the rush, too.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.102
Are you going to chime in
with some advice?

02:24.186 --> 02:28.649
Well, giving advice
isn't really what psychotherapists do.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.734
I mean, I'm not a life coach.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.235
Should I get a life coach?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.905
No. Don't do that.
That entire field is a joke.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.617
That was great. The way you just told me
not to get a life coach? More of that.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.285
I just met you...

02:40.869 --> 02:42.287
but is it possible that

02:42.371 --> 02:46.875
you are concerned that having a baby
will lead to some newfound intimacy

02:46.958 --> 02:49.378
between your married friends,
Ethan and Lisa,

02:49.461 --> 02:52.214
and that that will leave you feeling
shut out?

02:52.297 --> 02:56.593
So you're ending the affair pre-emptively
so that you don't end up feeling hurt?

02:58.178 --> 03:01.223
You don't know me. I don't hurt easily.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.683
Okay. It was just a theory.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.522
What is happening?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.191
This is not me.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.446
I must be getting my period or something.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.212
This is an old family fertility recipe.

03:32.295 --> 03:36.842
It's made from herbs foraged by my
grandmother in the Chungnyeongsan Forest.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.468
Wow. Thank you.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.812
It tastes like hot Crystal Light.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.605
You have to drink the whole thing.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.570
[gulps loudly]

04:07.372 --> 04:08.540
Oh, my God!

04:08.623 --> 04:11.585
-Has this ever worked for anyone?
-Not to my knowledge, no.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.216
<i>First, peel back the plastic...</i>

04:18.300 --> 04:20.135
-I have to stop for a second.
-Okay.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.345
<i>...remove the needle head from the safety.</i>

04:22.763 --> 04:23.847
He's ahead of me.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.557
[Felix] <i>For the first half of your cycle,</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:28.935
<i>you'll be injecting</i>
<i>a follicle stimulant every night,</i>

04:29.019 --> 04:30.729
<i>designed to make your body release</i>

04:30.812 --> 04:33.064
<i>as many eggs as possible at one time.</i>

04:33.148 --> 04:33.982
[Lisa] Do it.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.568
-You good? You ready?
-I'm ready, yes. You can do it.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.030
-I'm putting the needle in.
-Just do it. Yeah.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.824
That's it.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.534
[Ethan exhales]

04:44.618 --> 04:45.619
[Ethan] Okay. Alright.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.079
[Felix] <i>You'll need</i>
<i>to come into the office every morning</i>

04:48.163 --> 04:50.999
<i>for us to monitor hormone levels</i>
<i>and follicle growth.</i>

04:51.082 --> 04:52.292
Hi.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.045
Okay.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.256
Fitz, where the fuck were you?
Q4's looking like shit right now.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.468
-If you're late, you don't get to sit.
-Yeah, I'm not standing.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.721
Power move. I respect that. Okay.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.681
So, where were we?

05:07.015 --> 05:09.351
-I saw that.
-[man] U.S. equities are nasty right now.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.609
[whispers] Marianne...

05:17.692 --> 05:20.278
-Are you going to watch the video again?
-Yes.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.364
<i>...screw the safety cap on.</i>

05:22.447 --> 05:25.617
-Now I'm doing it. It's happening.
-Okay.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.661
-We're doing it.
-We're doing it.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.836
[nurse] Lisa Turner?

05:46.304 --> 05:49.224
Everything looks good. On the right side.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.274
Whoa!

05:57.357 --> 05:59.442
-Baby, are you alright?
-[Lisa] It's okay.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.736
Okay.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.157
[Felix] <i>Once we've got</i>
<i>as many mature follicles</i>

06:06.241 --> 06:08.493
<i>as your body will produce</i>
<i>on the drugs,</i>

06:08.577 --> 06:11.621
<i>I'll pick the ideal moment</i>
<i>for your trigger shot,</i>

06:11.705 --> 06:13.790
<i>also known as HCG.</i>

06:14.332 --> 06:17.877
I have these big bruises on my stomach

06:17.961 --> 06:20.964
from the Follistim shots
and they're super-painful.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.718
I can't sleep on my stomach or even
do up my pants. I mean, is that normal?

06:24.801 --> 06:28.138
Oh, yeah. No, it'll go away
in, like, 12 to 36 weeks.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.057
Oh, God, I have the worst paper cut.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.767
[groans in pain]

06:33.768 --> 06:34.644
Ow!

06:36.354 --> 06:38.857
Alright, are you guys clear
on the instructions?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.650
-[Lisa] Yeah.
-[Ethan] Yes.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.653
Give her the shot at 21:30 exactly,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.281
right on the X
that you put on her backside.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.700
Yes, it is imperative
that you give the shot

06:48.783 --> 06:51.161
exactly 36 and a half hours
before surgery.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.537
-Do you understand?
-[Lisa] Yes.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.874
Then you take her follicles,
mix them with my sperm, boom, right?

06:55.957 --> 06:58.627
-Exactly.
-Great. It's like<i> Mission Impossible.</i>

06:59.044 --> 07:01.379
Okay. One shot at 21:30.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.798
And no ejaculating between now and then.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.925
-Yep.
-Gotcha. Okay. I should...

07:06.009 --> 07:09.179
-I'll write this down.
-Maybe don't masturbate for a minute.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.598
If you need help,
you can call the page operator.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.517
She can put you in touch
with the doctor on call. Alright?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.645
-This is the big moment!
-So exciting!

07:16.728 --> 07:19.689
-I can't believe it's happening.
-Congrats on getting here.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.401
If I may, just one question about my side
of the equation, if you don't mind.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.196
-In regard to leaving my sample...
-Sure.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.116
-Honey, you don't need to be here.
-Oh, no, I think I do.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.744
-For this particular question?
-Absolutely, I do.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.414
So, the cup is Dixie-cup sized...

07:37.374 --> 07:40.377
and it's got a sharp, plastic edge.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.548
Perhaps they could provide me with
a cup with a larger circumference,

07:45.632 --> 07:48.802
or some kind of vessel
that just would require less accuracy?

07:48.885 --> 07:53.598
What about a Thermos with rubber lips
on it? Do you have any of those?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.183
[laughs loudly]

07:55.266 --> 07:58.103
Okay, that's very funny,
but I missed the first time, okay?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.688
I'm sorry, you missed?

08:01.523 --> 08:03.274
-Yes. I took care of it.
-Okay.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.111
Alright, well, let me know
if you need anything else.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.571
Thank you.
One more thing, if you don't mind.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.574
If we could also just have
some non-pornographic magazines

08:11.658 --> 08:14.577
that have more wholesome women
on the covers?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.329
Non-pornographic?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.832
<i>-Good Housekeeping...</i>
<i>-Town & Country?</i>

08:18.915 --> 08:23.336
-Alright. Okay.
-Additionally, the computer is very slow.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.214
And it seems that
an internet-enabled computer,

08:26.297 --> 08:29.342
which its primary function
is to browse pornography,

08:29.426 --> 08:33.513
is really susceptible to computer viruses,
especially if you're running Windows.

08:34.806 --> 08:35.849
I see.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.726
You have a phone, don't you?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.229
Alright, thank you very much.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.273
I will talk to the office manager, okay?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.775
We'll do the best we can. Thank you.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.445
Terrific.
So you'll talk to the office manager.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.030
There is no office manager.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.489
[Felix and Ethan laugh]

08:51.573 --> 08:53.283
But there is still pizza on my wall.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.452
[Felix] Alright. Okay.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.663
-Well, we got our HCG.
-Yes, we did.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.084
-Are you doing okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm actually really good.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.627
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.963
I just feel like
you've been going through hell

09:07.047 --> 09:09.758
and I just don't want to screw up
my end of the bargain.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.676
I'm just a little nervous about that.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.762
-Because it was weird in there.
-Okay.

09:13.845 --> 09:17.432
It was a little bit strange. It seemed
like it was about something else.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.351
I promise you that it is not, okay?

09:20.435 --> 09:21.644
Okay.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.440
-You're cute.
-Oh, yeah?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.943
-Well, thank you.
-I hope our kid gets your looks.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.362
And nothing else.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.409
Let me just ask you, exactly how long
is the razzing going to go on?

09:36.493 --> 09:37.327
Shh!

09:38.453 --> 09:40.872
-What is that?
-It's a glove.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.041
-What did you do?
-We're really doing this!

09:43.124 --> 09:45.794
-We're really freaking doing this!
-It's amazing!

09:49.005 --> 09:50.632
Oh, honey, is that...

09:56.596 --> 09:59.432
-[Ethan] Goodness! What's going on?
<i>-</i>A <i>Streetcar</i> cast party.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.269
-That's tonight?
-You get it? Stella!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.896
-[Lisa] Oh, right.
-Totally.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.731
What happened to all of our things?

10:06.815 --> 10:08.900
-Yeah.
-Oh, I put it in the garden shed.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.152
Thank you.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.074
You know what? I think it will be
too stressful to do the shot here.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.910
-Let's get a hotel room.
-Aren't you overreacting?

10:19.661 --> 10:23.289
I just heard a ten minute monologue
about your masturbation neuroses.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.416
-Fair enough.
-Yeah.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.835
I will book it now.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.878
Okay. It'll be romantic.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.299
Yeah, we'll make a night of it, right?
Like a sexy night of no sex.

-Look at those. Oh, that's horrible!

-That's got to hurt.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.087
Ouch!

11:11.171 --> 11:14.048
-Will you put it in me?
-Gonna get everything all fertile.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.010
Gonna take a pitchfork
and bury it in the soil...

11:17.093 --> 11:20.346
No, but seriously, can you get it,
because we've got ten minutes.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.811
-Shit!
-What?

11:26.895 --> 11:29.314
-Where is the needle?
-It's in the bag.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.401
No. This is, like, soy sauce,
and hot mustard and stuff.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.987
-Why...
-There's no...

11:36.070 --> 11:38.698
-I brought the wrong bag from Marianne's.
-What?

Why does she have so many bags?

And these are my twins, Cronos and Shiva.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.067
They're 39 months.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.652
I got the needle.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.863
-They're beautiful.
-They're great. Hi. Thanks. I got it.

13:00.947 --> 13:01.948
Excuse us.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.783
We need this.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.159
Please.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.204
-This is...
-Oh, my God.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.081
-It's an adventure.
-You need help?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.791
I got it, babe. I promise you.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.001
-Sure?
-Oh, yeah.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.129
-It's 21:37, so...
-Just let me do my thing here.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.297
[incessant rapping on door]

13:18.381 --> 13:20.925
-Hello?
-Yeah, just give us a minute.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.094
Thank you very much.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.015
Right, just going to get this going here.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.560
<i>-Carefully unscrew...</i>
-You don't need to watch it.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.188
Honey, it's a new swab part because
we haven't done this procedure yet.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.940
-Okay.
-Wipe up...

13:36.024 --> 13:36.899
[knocking on door]

13:36.983 --> 13:38.901
Can you give us a minute, please?

13:38.985 --> 13:42.613
1.5 milliliters.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.867
-How much?
<i>-</i>[guests sing] <i>One, two, three, four, five</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:47.493
<i>Four, three, two, one</i>

13:47.577 --> 13:48.870
[woman] Guys! Come on!

13:48.953 --> 13:50.246
Now I don't know.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.290
Give us a fucking minute!

13:52.373 --> 13:56.419
<i>One point five and one point five</i>
<i>and one point five</i>

13:57.253 --> 14:00.298
<i>-One, two, three, four, five...</i>
-What are you doing?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.925
-I'm washing my hands to keep it hygienic.
-Okay.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.218
Okay?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.181
That's not soap. That's lotion.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.640
It's fine.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.851
This is also lotion.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.478
-Just...
-It's all lotion.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.146
Look, see this? Lotion.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.606
Lotion.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.899
Lotion primer.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.151
Ridiculous.
No wonder her skin's so soft.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.778
-I got lotion hands.
-Ready?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.488
Yeah, I'm ready.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.906
Okay.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.493
God, how weird is it that this bathroom
might be the story

14:28.576 --> 14:30.203
of our child's conception?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.423
I am so sorry.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.342
I am sorry.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.388
I think it was the lotion
and... I can't believe this.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.890
There's gotta be some left in there.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.976
Yeah. No, look, there's a little residue,
but there's no...

14:54.060 --> 14:56.479
-On both sides, it's messed up.
-We can get it off.

14:56.562 --> 15:00.191
It's nothing but glass. It's contaminated.
I can't inject you with glass.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.611
-You can and you will.
-I will not inject you with glass.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.488
We're not having a glass baby.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.408
-Do you have any extra?
-No!

15:08.491 --> 15:10.785
Each vial costs hundreds of dollars!

15:10.868 --> 15:13.413
God damn it,
the whole procedure cost $30,000.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.082
It would've been nice to have
a backup or something.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.836
Are you seriously blaming me for
not anticipating you dropping the vial?

15:19.919 --> 15:23.172
Look, you know that I drop shit.
Of course I'm not blaming you.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.967
We don't have time for this.
We need to find another dose.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.969
-Where?
-Felix! We need to find Felix.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.888
-Okay. I'm calling Max right now.
-Call Max.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.267
-What's happening?
-He's not answering.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.270
Oh, my God, it's 21:42!
We need to find Felix!

15:37.353 --> 15:39.981
I got it. Here it is. Okay.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.941
-What?
-Max's Instagram feed.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.443
-You're on Instagram?
-Don't worry.

15:44.694 --> 15:48.114
-I don't know what this is telling me!
-They're at The Table!

15:48.197 --> 15:50.283
-What's that?
-An exclusive restaurant.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.328
There's a three-year waiting list to get
in. They grow all the food on the roof.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.914
-Where is it?
-Sorry, none of that was important.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.541
It's in Gowanus. Here we go.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.460
And cheeseburgers.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.627
Wow!

16:01.711 --> 16:03.838
This looks amazing. What's in this?

16:03.921 --> 16:07.800
It's<i></i>foie gras, Gorgonzola foam
and toasted slices of spam.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.470
-It's incredible.
-It tastes like a cheeseburger.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.183
What is this place?

16:16.267 --> 16:19.228
It's a restaurant
that's behind another restaurant.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.438
What?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.819
[Felix] This is just incredible.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.197
It's great.
I am humbled by your creativity.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
For some reason, I want him to like me.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.411
Hey, Max?

16:35.912 --> 16:39.207
-Hey!
-Oh, my gosh, look who's here!

16:39.290 --> 16:41.209
-[Ethan] Can we talk to you?
-This is amazing!

16:41.292 --> 16:43.211
This makes perfect sense now!

16:43.294 --> 16:46.297
I was wondering why
none of my best friends were calling me

16:46.380 --> 16:49.425
on my 40th birthday
or texting me or anything.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.179
And it hurt my feelings a little bit,
I'm not going to lie,

16:53.262 --> 16:55.765
but it's worth it,
because it was for the surprise!

16:55.848 --> 16:58.768
-Happy birthday, Max!
-Yes! Thank you!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.978
Yes, it is! Come, join us!

17:01.062 --> 17:02.813
We can't join so much.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.066
-Felix, we need to talk.
-Fruit roll-ups.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.984
Ooh!

17:07.068 --> 17:08.152
Thank you very much.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.990
-So, Felix... We have a question.
-It's strawberry<i> sauvage.</i>

17:13.074 --> 17:15.326
Wild strawberries. Pressed.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.620
Excellent.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.832
And then just a touch of gelatin,
sourced from pigs' hoofs.

17:21.916 --> 17:22.792
Okay.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.294
Fed local acorns.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.797
Local acorns and nutmeg, as well.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.758
-Yeah.
-There's a guy up-state in Hudson...

17:30.841 --> 17:32.969
-[shouts] Stop it!
-[Ethan whispers] Just for a second.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.430
Listen, it's 10:15, okay?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.141
-We're 45 minutes late.
-Late for what?

17:39.225 --> 17:42.812
My shot of HCG.
We were supposed to take it at 21:30.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.690
-The vial broke.
-He broke the vial.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.192
-Okay. Did you call the page operator?
-The who?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.610
-The page operator.
-Yes.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.404
Yes. Absolutely.

17:51.487 --> 17:55.575
We called the page operator. We did that
first. The switchboard was busy.

17:55.658 --> 17:59.245
-The switchboard. We couldn't get through.
-There is no switchboard.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.541
This isn't<i> I Love Lucy.</i> You call, leave
a message, and they get right back to you.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.669
I assure you, it happens.
These things happen. Alright.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.713
Good to see you guys and good luck.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.841
Thank you and we will no longer
interrupt you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.092
Okay.

18:13.175 --> 18:17.888
I wasn't so sad, guys.
I was just surprised is all. I'm okay.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.557
Yeah. It's my birthday.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.310
-Are you dialing?
-Yes.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.645
I don't know what to say.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.481
Tell them what happened.
Just leave a call-back number.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.608
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.068
Hi, my name is Ethan Turner.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.488
-Lisa Turner is my wife.
-Lisa Turner is my wife and...

18:34.572 --> 18:35.740
Call-back number.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.243
-You can call us at 734-682...
-Tell them what happened.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.913
We dropped the vial of HCG. It's broken.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.373
Supposed to take it at 21:30.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.002
We were supposed to take it at 21:30
and we didn't get to do that.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.211
Thank you very much.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.173
Call us back whenever you can.
Thank you so much.

18:52.256 --> 18:56.010
-Call us back as soon as possible.
-I am so sorry to interrupt your evening.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.432
That's good, I think.
I mean, where do you even get this stuff?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.729
-[Ethan] No, sir!
-[Lisa] Please!

19:06.812 --> 19:09.398
[Ethan] We just need one minute
of your time. Two minutes!

19:11.651 --> 19:13.819
-Open the door!
-Lisa...

19:13.903 --> 19:15.404
-[shouts] Open the door!
-Honey...

19:16.113 --> 19:18.199
-Open the door!
-Sir...

19:18.282 --> 19:20.493
Honey... She's sorry.
She doesn't mean that.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.120
-If you open the door for one minute...
-God damn it!

19:23.204 --> 19:25.915
-What is going on?
-[screams] Open the door! Come on!

19:25.998 --> 19:27.249
Open the door!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.710
-Hey! Lisa!
-Open the fucking door!

19:29.794 --> 19:32.672
-Why aren't you helping me?
-Because you're acting crazy.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.008
-What did you just say?
-I'm sorry.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.677
-What did you say?
-I meant...

19:37.760 --> 19:40.846
-What did you say? Don't call me crazy.
-Okay. I won't.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.307
[voice breaks] You have no idea
what this has been like for me.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.227
It's like having a full-time job
that sucks

19:46.310 --> 19:48.771
on top of another full-time job
that sucks.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.774
If you weren't so busy
fine-tuning your masturbation protocol,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.193
you wouldn't have dropped the vial!

19:54.276 --> 19:57.571
We have no Oxy.
We have no Oxy, do you hear me?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.949
-No Oxy. You understand me? No Oxy!
-Sir...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.451
We don't want Oxy, sir. HCG.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.036
We want HCG, please.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.873
Sir, please. It's for fertility.
We're trying to have a baby.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.501
Please, sir!

20:10.584 --> 20:13.379
Look, I can't sign back
into the system now.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.089
It's all turned off.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.924
I'll suck your dick?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.638
I did the math,

20:23.180 --> 20:25.683
and, yes, I would suck a dick for $30,000.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.810
That's the conclusion that I came to.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.854
It would be crazy not to.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.273
You know?

20:35.109 --> 20:35.985
Oh.

20:36.986 --> 20:37.820
Oh...

20:37.903 --> 20:39.488
-What?
-I missed a call.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.283
[shouts] How could you miss a call?

20:42.366 --> 20:46.412
Well, because we were throwing Coke cans
and garbage at a pharmacy!

20:46.495 --> 20:48.998
-It was a little loud!
-[angrily] Listen to the message!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.792
Listen to it! Who is it?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.294
-I'm listening.
-Who is it?

20:53.377 --> 20:56.172
I'm trying to hear it. Lisa, it's Dr...

20:56.255 --> 20:58.215
-Tell me who it is!
-It's Dr. Trevino.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.385
He's saying to call in the morning
to reschedule the retrieval.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.970
-No!
-That's what he's saying.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.139
He doesn't understand.
We need to do it now!

21:07.475 --> 21:11.270
-Please don't offer to suck Felix's dick.
-I can't do anything right.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.272
You're mad if I do, you're mad if I don't.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.191
To be clear, I'm not mad if you don't.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.112
-Hey, Felix.
-[chef] Smell it first.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.907
-[Felix] Oh, Jesus Christ.
-No, I'm really sorry.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.494
But we talked to Dr. Trevino
and he said that we have to reschedule.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.455
But I'm going to lose half of my follicles
if he does that.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.208
I am genuinely so sorry about this,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.376
but, literally, there's nothing I can do.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.171
-I know, but I...
-There's got to be something you can do.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.216
-They've been trying for years.
-Everyone tries for years.

21:40.299 --> 21:45.304
Look, every one of these surgeries
is tied to a timed shot.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.015
I have another couple
who took a shot at 22:00 tonight,

21:48.098 --> 21:50.309
another at 22:30,
another who did it at 23:00,

21:50.392 --> 21:51.769
23:30 and so on...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.187
We follow.

21:53.270 --> 21:57.233
And if I reschedule with you, it means
another couple loses their chance.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.360
And that's not fair.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.863
I'm the only doctor in this week
because Feinstein's out in Montauk.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.366
Look, these are my oldest friends, hun.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.910
Consider this a birthday present to me.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.871
Along with the dinner, which is...
you know, I'm enjoying.

22:17.253 --> 22:20.464
-Alright. Yes, of course.
-Oh, my God! Thank you!

22:20.548 --> 22:23.592
-Thank you so much.
-Yes, alright. Please don't cry.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.511
-I know what to do. Let's go.
-Yes!

22:25.594 --> 22:26.637
Thank you.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.851
-[Lisa] What's happening?
-The pharmacy's locked.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.145
Yeah, there are prescription drugs
in there.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.898
I'll go find Mohammed.
He'll have the key. Hold on.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.985
It's kind of like a fun caper, right?

22:41.068 --> 22:44.029
-You know before, when you yelled at me?
-Which time?

22:44.113 --> 22:47.199
[panting] When you accused me
of not knowing what you're going through.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.076
-That's not what I said.
-It is.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.620
-It's not what I meant!
-Look at the Sphinx here.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.622
-Then, what did you mean?
-I just...

22:54.123 --> 22:58.043
I can't believe you don't want to have
a child so bad that you would sabotage it.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.045
-You think I broke it on purpose?
-Yeah.

23:00.129 --> 23:03.757
-I didn't break it on purpose.
-You didn't, but your subconscious did.

23:03.841 --> 23:08.095
Neither I, nor my subconscious,
broke the vial on purpose, okay?

23:08.178 --> 23:11.932
You left the needle at Marianne's
apartment. Did you do that on purpose?

23:12.016 --> 23:13.601
I didn't... You know what? No.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.478
You used to be on board
with having a child

23:16.562 --> 23:18.897
and now it doesn't seem like
you want to do that.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.482
Can you just be honest with me?

23:20.566 --> 23:21.900
Be honest with me!

23:21.984 --> 23:24.737
-Do you want to have a child?
-I don't know!

23:26.822 --> 23:28.198
I don't know.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.951
But you do, and I love you,

23:31.035 --> 23:33.954
and I want you to get what you want.

23:34.538 --> 23:38.125
That's the only thing that matters to me
in the whole world, alright?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.544
And I think I broke the stupid shot

23:40.628 --> 23:43.505
because I feel like I fail you

23:43.589 --> 23:45.966
every time I try anything.

23:46.050 --> 23:49.470
I can't find an apartment,
I can't comfort you properly.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.306
I can't even bribe a pharmacist correctly.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.851
-We don't have time for this.
-What?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.063
-Oh, my God! No!
-[Max] Wait! Not the chair.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.606
[alarm sounds]

24:00.689 --> 24:03.400
-I got this.
-Be careful. There's glass everywhere.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.943
I'll be okay.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.445
I'm wearing shoes.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.614
Oh, right, yeah.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.283
That was awesome!

24:13.994 --> 24:14.828
Bingo.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.172
This is a lot of work!

24:28.509 --> 24:30.135
-You want to do it?
-Toss it here.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.057
[Ethan] Boom! X marks the spot!

24:35.849 --> 24:37.643
Yes!

24:37.726 --> 24:38.602
[excited scream]

24:38.686 --> 24:39.687
We did it!

24:47.069 --> 24:48.612
[yells] What is wrong with you people?

24:51.073 --> 24:52.616
We are going to pay for this.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.035
You live on someone's couch!

25:06.255 --> 25:09.717
Hello, I'm Dr. Feinstein
and I'll be doing your retrieval today

25:09.800 --> 25:12.177
instead of enjoying my vacation

25:12.261 --> 25:15.264
with my family in Montauk.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.182
-Any questions?
-No...

25:17.266 --> 25:19.309
Not really. But thank you so much.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.437
Nothing makes me happier

25:21.520 --> 25:24.690
than seeing my weeping children
chasing my car

25:24.773 --> 25:27.735
as I come here to help you
start your family.

25:32.448 --> 25:36.410
-I think that's sarcasm.
-Okay, Lisa. I've started your IV.

25:36.493 --> 25:41.707
You're going to feel a warm, pleasant,
tingling sensation akin to orgasm,

25:41.790 --> 25:44.126
and then off you go to dreamland.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.170
-Okay.
-Thank you so much.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.713
-Boy...
-Thank you.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.883
Okay, that seemed inappropriate.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.844
Babe, that doctor...

25:53.927 --> 25:57.014
I'm a little worried
he's going to get up there

25:57.097 --> 26:00.392
and he's just going to...
poke around at other stuff.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.687
-He seems really pissed off at us.
-No, baby. He won't do that.

26:03.771 --> 26:06.273
He's a professional.
I promise you it won't happen.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.859
Hey, good luck, man.
You've got this, okay?

26:08.942 --> 26:10.486
You've got this.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.946
-Good luck in the jizz room.
-Okay.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.824
-You jizz it on up in there.
-I'll jizz it out.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.534
Hey, you want a dick pic?

26:18.202 --> 26:20.621
No, because if it's you, baby,
it's not a dick pic.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.664
-You know what I mean.
-Alright.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.710
Give it here.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.254
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.590
Oh, yeah.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.133
[meows like a cat]

26:33.217 --> 26:35.511
-There you go.
-That's gonna do the trick.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.304
That's the one, babe. Thank you.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.139
Okay.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.766
-I love you.
-I love you.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.606
Alright.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.830
It's still
a very challenging circumference.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.050
Stand it is. Okay.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.349
<i>Blackmaled.</i>

27:23.684 --> 27:24.726
That's clever.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.023
Alright.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.275
What?

27:31.942 --> 27:33.068
And again.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.487
[groans in frustration]

27:54.423 --> 27:55.632
Okay.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.634
The problem is her vaginal cyst.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.094
Oh, my God.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.391
Okay.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.477
<i>Ethan...</i>

28:13.400 --> 28:15.944
Inject me right in my abdomen.

28:17.988 --> 28:18.947
[children wailing]

28:22.993 --> 28:24.411
<i>Ethan...</i>

28:42.596 --> 28:43.805
[whispers] Oh, God.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.315
Good afternoon.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.483
Good luck.
