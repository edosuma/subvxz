00:02.602 --> 00:06.840
**

00:09.777 --> 00:15.049
**

00:15.083 --> 00:20.321
**

00:25.793 --> 00:27.428
Jerry!
Jerry, come on!

00:27.461 --> 00:28.996
We got to go!
You got to come with me, Jerry!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.431
Rick?
It's important, Jerry.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.333
The fate of the galaxy
rests on your shoulders.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.834
Let's go.
Put some pants on.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.669
N-Never mind, there's no time
for pants, Jerry.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.238
I'll make you a pair of pants
on the way.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.173
It's a Rick and Jerry adventure!

00:39.207 --> 00:40.941
Rick and Jerry episode!

00:40.974 --> 00:48.974
**

00:50.984 --> 00:58.984
**

01:00.994 --> 01:08.994
**

01:13.307 --> 01:15.376
Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.245
He's... He's good
with regular folk."

01:17.278 --> 01:19.480
This is a real situation
where... where...

01:19.513 --> 01:21.081
Where Jerry could really shine.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.650
He's a master convincer."

01:22.683 --> 01:25.153
Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.787
Oh. Okay, well,
I told Morty,

01:26.820 --> 01:29.123
"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

01:29.157 --> 01:31.992
but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know... Pbht!

01:32.025 --> 01:33.461
And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.995
It impedes my work.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.830
So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.466
Wait. My son asked you
to take me

01:38.499 --> 01:40.334
on some kind of pity adventure

01:40.368 --> 01:41.835
to keep me from killing myself?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.304
Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

01:43.337 --> 01:44.838
An execution.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.974
Geez!
You really do need a win.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.442
No!
I-I don't know.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.010
I mean, you never made me
the pants, so...

01:50.043 --> 01:51.579
So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

01:51.612 --> 01:52.772
into the middle of the galaxy

01:52.780 --> 01:54.182
and shove you
into the vacuum of space

01:54.215 --> 01:55.449
with your dick hanging out?

01:55.483 --> 01:56.643
And we're seeing how you'd act

01:56.650 --> 01:57.985
if that were about to happen?

01:58.018 --> 01:59.687
I mean shit I'll make you
the pants right now.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.088
Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.656
I have pants at home!
Jerry, if I make pants,

02:02.690 --> 02:04.292
they'll be better than
your pants at home.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.605
Also, if I wanted to kill you...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.295
Yeah, I get it.
It would be amazing.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.596
Please, take me home.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.198
I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.499
Well, if it's all the same,

02:11.532 --> 02:12.700
could we go
get our story straight?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.368
Because you're a terrible liar.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.936
You called me
a master convincer!

02:15.969 --> 02:17.371
You believed me?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.545
Huh. This seems...
kind of fancy.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.280
Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

02:26.314 --> 02:27.548
of an alien truck stop.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.849
You have no frame of reference.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.384
You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.453
But, yes, it is super fancy.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.987
I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.889
I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.058
Rick Sanchez.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.361
I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

02:40.394 --> 02:41.914
I would stick you
like the pig you are.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.165
Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

02:45.199 --> 02:47.835
There'd be two funerals.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.803
Aaah!!

02:49.837 --> 02:52.306
Someone?

02:52.340 --> 02:55.209
Uh, someone?
Someone!

02:58.779 --> 03:00.748
My friend!
It has been too long.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.350
Oh, it's great
to see you again, buddy!

03:02.383 --> 03:04.585
Yeah, you're doing it.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.420
Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

03:06.454 --> 03:08.422
The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.190
You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.496
Okay, but still...
Bad parenting.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.265
Hey, rich a-holes are
rich a-holes.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.699
They all pay top dollar
to come here

03:18.732 --> 03:20.568
and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.270
No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.605
Can't even have a heart attack.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.073
Got it.
The perfect place

03:26.106 --> 03:27.741
to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.510
I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

03:29.543 --> 03:30.711
but it's right on the money.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.945
If I come home without you,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.681
I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.616
Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.917
Jeff Goldblum?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.352
What the fuck are you
talking about, Jerry?

03:38.386 --> 03:40.120
Jesus!

03:40.153 --> 03:41.722
Holy fucking shit!

03:41.755 --> 03:43.257
Yo, what's up, "Big Chill"?!

03:43.291 --> 03:44.925
Don't go into the telepod!

03:46.093 --> 03:47.961
Hey, maybe we would have fun
on a fake adventure.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.730
On a fake adventure.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.565
Speaking of...
What are we gonna tell Morty?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.066
I don't know.
But whatever it is,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.403
we're gonna need a couple more
of these babies!

03:56.804 --> 03:59.373
What's wrong?

03:59.407 --> 04:01.409
Mom, do you think I'm hot?

04:01.442 --> 04:05.078
I...don't think that's something
that matters.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.314
So, I'm not hot?!

04:06.347 --> 04:08.749
I'm saying the part of you
that cares about that

04:08.782 --> 04:10.551
is a part you shouldn't
give any energy to.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.919
That's not an answer!

04:11.952 --> 04:13.721
Because I'm not an issue
of Cosmo, okay?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.222
I'm your mother
and a doctor, and...

04:15.255 --> 04:16.557
I'm hideous!

04:17.858 --> 04:19.226
Geez.
What's with her?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.661
Teenage-girl stuff.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.831
Is that a...
hoof collage?

04:23.864 --> 04:27.100
It's perfectly legal, if that's
what you're wondering.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.737
Cool... zies.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.606
"We just don't have anything
in common any more, Summer."

04:32.640 --> 04:34.007
Oh, yeah, Ethan?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.976
What do you have in common
with Tricia Lange?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.845
A mutual love of French cinema?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.313
The belief that a carbon tax

04:39.347 --> 04:42.182
is the only viable solution
to climate change?

04:42.215 --> 04:45.486
Or could it be
her massive stripper titties?!

04:45.519 --> 04:47.455
There it is.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.190
Boob-ya!

04:50.223 --> 04:52.092
And that's when
Malakai the Squid came,

04:52.125 --> 04:57.465
rips off his face,
and beneath it is my face.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.667
I liked it.
Thank you, sir.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.201
Yeah, of course he likes it.
Look at him.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.471
Motherfucker got two heads
and three trunks.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.672
All right,
we'll put a pin in it.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.039
I'm gonna go take a leak.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.016
What the...?!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.124
My hands are dry!
My hands are dry!

05:24.157 --> 05:27.395
**

05:27.428 --> 05:29.229
My name is Risotto Groupon.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.865
I am the assistant general
manager of the restaurant.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.534
Do you have any comment cards,

05:33.567 --> 05:34.968
because I might have
some thoughts.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.805
My kingdom was usurped by force

05:37.838 --> 05:39.139
with weapons and technology

05:39.172 --> 05:40.874
supplied by
your father-in-law!

05:40.908 --> 05:43.243
Hey, he usurped
my kingdom, too, man.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.046
He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.315
Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

05:48.348 --> 05:50.584
what your life could have been
without Rick.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.852
Wondered? Sure.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.887
I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.255
Would you help me kill him?

05:55.288 --> 05:56.590
What? No!

05:56.624 --> 05:58.426
He's my wife's father.
Move on.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.494
Do you...
like theme-park rides?

06:00.528 --> 06:02.162
Oh, you really moved on.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.233
There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.002
Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

06:09.036 --> 06:12.105
the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.274
You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

06:14.307 --> 06:17.177
I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

06:17.210 --> 06:20.380
get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

06:20.414 --> 06:22.716
where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.618
Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

06:24.652 --> 06:25.919
pulled from thin air.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.287
I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.723
Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

06:29.757 --> 06:32.059
the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.795
Look, I'm not like Rick,

06:34.828 --> 06:37.064
so you're free to do
as you please.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
But there comes a time
in every man's life

06:39.132 --> 06:41.068
when he must choose
the foundation

06:41.101 --> 06:43.136
on which his legacy
will be built...

06:43.170 --> 06:46.640
One of compromise
or one of blood.

06:48.909 --> 06:53.180
* Once a time of year,
there's a special person here *

07:00.253 --> 07:02.890
Oh, yeah.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.092
That's what I'm talking about.

07:05.125 --> 07:09.162
Oops! Okay, a little more
on the other side then.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.498
Oh, come on!

07:10.531 --> 07:12.399
Oh, geez!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.067
Aah! Stop!

07:14.101 --> 07:17.104
So, the hospital just let you
walk right out of there

07:17.137 --> 07:18.506
with horse parts in a bag?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.673
For Christ's sakes, Morty,

07:19.707 --> 07:20.774
women going through a divorce

07:20.808 --> 07:21.942
need a creative outlet.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.511
What was that?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.147
Summer!

07:29.483 --> 07:31.051
I'm coming, Summer!

07:32.820 --> 07:34.187
What the hell happened?!

07:37.891 --> 07:39.326
How do we get her
back to normal?!

07:39.359 --> 07:41.795
I don't know, man! This thing is
pretty complicated.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.196
I-I'm gonna call Rick.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.165
Well, hold on.
We can't just call your grandpa

07:45.198 --> 07:46.634
whenever there's a problem.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.201
We can handle this ourselves.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
I mean, I don't see the point
in trying to.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
This is obviously
Rick-level shit.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.707
I have a medical degree.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.142
Is that what this is about?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.677
L-Like, you want
to prove yourself?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.846
Oh, it's not about anything,
Morty. How dare you?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.380
Okay, good.
Then I'll just call... Ow!

08:00.413 --> 08:02.215
Morty, I need this.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.385
Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here
says he knows a place

08:05.418 --> 08:07.688
where the ladies drop panties
for anyone bi-pedal.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.961
Yeah, I'm not really interested.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.724
My heart still belongs to Beth.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.225
Oh. Huh. Okay.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.228
What, you don't think
I have a shot?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.329
I didn't say that.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.465
Excuse me.
May I have another one of these?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.033
Coming right up.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.870
Hmm, things weren't always
so bad between Beth and me.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.638
We had some good times
when we were younger.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.039
Oh, yeah, I bet.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.708
That's how teenage pregnancy
happens, my friend.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.242
Yeah, no.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.679
Things were pretty great, even
until a couple of years ago.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.013
Jerry, I get it.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.648
That's around the time
I moved in with you guys.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.982
Oh, I guess you're right.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.517
Jerry, you know,
I hope you're not suggesting

08:37.551 --> 08:39.419
that I had anything to do
with your marriage breaking up,

08:39.452 --> 08:42.222
because there are some major
issues between you and Beth

08:42.255 --> 08:44.224
that have been there
since you guys met.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.893
**

08:45.926 --> 08:48.696
Hey, to new beginnings.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.397
To the Whirly Dirly.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.932
The Whirly Dirly?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.434
All right, what's going on here?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.269
When did you get cool?!

08:57.470 --> 08:58.839
When you stole my wife!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.040
I should have done that
a long time ago!

09:00.073 --> 09:01.842
We're going on the Whirly Dirly!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.410
Whirly Dirly, baby.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.213
Aha, look at this.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.581
It says "normalize."

09:07.615 --> 09:09.049
I bet if we just press that...

09:09.082 --> 09:11.084
But... if the machine was made
by spider people,

09:11.118 --> 09:12.920
normal would mean eight legs.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.888
Oh, God! are you gonna
go on another spiel

09:14.922 --> 09:16.790
like you did
with the flesh-colored crayon?

09:16.824 --> 09:19.226
I'm pretty sure "normalize"
will make her normal.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.930
Aah!

09:22.963 --> 09:24.898
I'd call that progress.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.399
She's huge!
And normal!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.035
I'm not normal!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.136
Mom!

09:29.169 --> 09:30.303
Okay, this says "reverse."
Done and done.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.072
I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.185
Oh, come on! What else
could "reverse" possibly mean?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.710
Aah!

09:36.744 --> 09:38.746
Mom, call Rick!

09:38.779 --> 09:40.147
Thank you.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.715
There's a customer-service
number on here.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.950
Mom!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.289
Oh, man.
This is gonna be awesome!

09:49.322 --> 09:51.959
I got to hand it to you, Jerry.
This was a solid idea.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.160
Uh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.162
And you know what?
I'll cop to it.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.730
I put a lot of strain
on your marriage.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.498
It wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.433
What?!
I didn't respect
your marriage.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.969
I certainly
didn't do it any favors.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.436
And for what it's worth,

10:03.470 --> 10:05.605
I'll apologize to Beth for it
when we get home.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.841
Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!

10:07.875 --> 10:09.176
Stop the ride!
We got to get off.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.644
What are you
talking about, buddy?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.179
We got to get out of this thing.
We got to get out!

10:12.212 --> 10:14.414
Jerry, come on, man!

10:14.447 --> 10:15.949
We haven't even gotten
to the first whirly.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.251
No, no, this sucks.
It's so boring.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.820
I mean, I'm falling asleep here.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.573
Let's just get out and crawl
down the sides.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.365
Uh, get down!
Duck down!

10:32.399 --> 10:33.867
It's more fun
when you scrunch down.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.969
Jerry, what the...

10:36.003 --> 10:38.471
Oh shit!

10:53.987 --> 10:56.389
Rick, up here! There's
a spot where you can kill him!

10:56.423 --> 11:00.127
Good call, Jerry!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.661
Hey, how'd you know about that?

11:01.695 --> 11:02.996
Uh...

11:19.279 --> 11:20.580
Lisa?

11:26.086 --> 11:31.058
So, uh, Jerry, big fan
of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.226
Not anymore.
Obviously.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.063
But when you were,
how did you know about it?

11:38.966 --> 11:42.903
We had a deal, Jerry Smith.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.941
It's a really common name.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.044
Now, take it easy, Rick.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.679
You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.312
It's... It's no time
to be thinking about

11:54.314 --> 11:56.784
who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.518
Get it off me!

11:58.551 --> 11:59.853
It's eating me!

11:59.887 --> 12:01.388
Look, I confess, okay?

12:01.421 --> 12:03.023
They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

12:03.056 --> 12:05.092
and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.693
But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

12:06.726 --> 12:08.061
you're not a monster...
Not like this thing.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.863
Fuck It's got me good.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.098
This is a mislead, right?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.900
You're inventing a thing
to save me.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.333
That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.769
It's been invented.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.637
I'm making a way out of here...
One seat ought to do it.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.139
I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.708
I won't do it again!
Nobody ever does.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.779
You self-righteous
piece of shit

12:25.813 --> 12:27.380
You took my family!

12:27.414 --> 12:28.782
I took your family?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.317
Who do you think
had more taken from them

12:30.350 --> 12:31.584
when you shot 20 ccs

12:31.618 --> 12:33.453
of liquid dream-killer
into my daughter?

12:33.486 --> 12:36.323
She was Rick's daughter, Jerry.
She had options!

12:36.356 --> 12:37.724
Oof.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.726
That all ended
because she felt sorry for you.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.895
You act like prey,
but you're a predator!

12:41.929 --> 12:43.596
You use pity to lure in
your victims!

12:43.630 --> 12:44.932
That's how you survive!

12:44.965 --> 12:46.266
I survive
because I know everything.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.301
That snakes survives
because children wander off,

12:48.335 --> 12:49.937
and you survive
because people think,

12:49.970 --> 12:52.572
"Oh, this poor piece of shit.
He never gets a break.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.441
I can't stand
the deafening silent wails

12:54.474 --> 12:55.809
of his wilting soul.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.444
I guess I'll hire him
or marry him."

12:57.477 --> 13:01.014
- Rick!
- Rick!

13:06.619 --> 13:08.088
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.489
That was never an option.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.958
Because you never had a son.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.592
No, because I need
a living organism

13:12.625 --> 13:15.462
coated in gibble snake bile
to attract a shmooglite runner.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.530
Wait, what's happening?
Use that confusion,
Jerry.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.767
It'll make you wriggle more like
an abandoned newborn.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.770
Jesus Christ!

13:23.803 --> 13:26.773
What the fuck Rick?!

13:26.806 --> 13:29.276
Help!
Help me!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.079
Aaah!

13:40.487 --> 13:42.956
There's a space port
20 miles south.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.992
We'll be able to board
a galaxy class cruise ship

13:45.025 --> 13:46.393
and jump through a wormhole
that will put us

13:46.426 --> 13:48.962
within spitting distance
of the Milky Way.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.363
But, hey,
it's about the journey,

13:50.397 --> 13:52.465
not the destination,
right, Jerry?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.571
Just stay put, sweetie!
Mom's still on hold.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.640
Morphizer customer service.
How may I help you?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.993
Yes, I'm having a little trouble
with one of your machines.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.644
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.480
Do you see a little compartment
on the side of the machine?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.049
Let me check.
Yes, got it.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.383
Mom?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.986
Great! Now, do you see
the little button next to it?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.888
I do.
Give that button
a push.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.556
Okay.
Mom, listen to me!

14:16.589 --> 14:18.858
We're free!!

14:18.892 --> 14:21.728
Okay, so I pushed the button,
and three little men ran out.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.596
What do I do next?

14:23.630 --> 14:24.998
Hello?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.166
I think we got disconnected.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.267
Morty!

14:27.300 --> 14:28.435
Don't "Morty" me!

14:28.468 --> 14:30.170
I tricked Rick into taking Dad
on an adventure

14:30.203 --> 14:31.338
because I thought
I could get a break

14:31.371 --> 14:32.940
from this kind of shit but no!

14:32.973 --> 14:35.175
Like father,
like Goddamn daughter!

14:35.208 --> 14:37.377
You want to be like Rick,
congratulations!

14:37.410 --> 14:40.513
You're just as arrogant
and just as irresponsible!

14:40.547 --> 14:41.848
Everything okay here?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.450
Mind your own Goddamn
business, Gene!

14:43.483 --> 14:46.286
I'm having a conversation
with my mother here!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.421
Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna
help him keep him around,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.358
Mom, but it will help you lose
everyone else.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.193
Like I lost Summer.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.894
Hey, you haven't lost her yet.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.863
No, I definitely did.
She's gone.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.531
God damn it!

15:00.900 --> 15:01.935
Go ahead.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.605
Oh, come on.
What's happening?

15:05.638 --> 15:08.875
Your friend is class C or above
cybernetic augmentations.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.377
Emphasis on the above.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.911
In any case,
he needs to be neutralized.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.213
What?! Wait!

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
Ugh!

15:14.281 --> 15:16.283
Brain hurty.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.550
What did you do?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.586
It's a synaptic dampener
that blocks violent tendencies

15:19.619 --> 15:20.920
and controversial thought.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.056
He will now be
an ideal passenger.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.292
I want cookies
and a 90-minute cut of "Avatar."

15:25.325 --> 15:26.826
Seriously?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.595
Quit it.
It'll wear off
in six hours.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.298
It's cheaper than banning
dangerous people from flights.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.100
I mean, let everybody
buy a ticket, right?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.901
Otherwise, the terrorists win.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.406
**

15:39.439 --> 15:40.740
Aah!

15:40.773 --> 15:43.310
I'm sorry I'm not
a classic maternal archetype.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.178
Okay, I don't know what to do
when you people come to me

15:45.212 --> 15:47.080
with your weird puberty issues.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.082
What are you gonna do
when your daughter asks you

15:49.116 --> 15:50.183
if she's attractive?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.452
I'll say "yes"!
Morty, gross!

15:52.485 --> 15:54.087
Well, she's gonna be super hot.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.755
Her mother's gonna be Jessica...

15:55.788 --> 15:57.324
Wait, when did Summer
ask you that?!

15:57.357 --> 15:59.759
Right before she Clive Barkered
herself. Why?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.261
Wait, I know where she is!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.196
Ethan and Summer were
supposed to go camping,

16:03.230 --> 16:05.432
and then he dumped Summer
for this girl, Tricia Lange,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.600
who's got huge boobies
and took her.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.769
Campsite... The one with the
name that sounds like somebody

16:09.802 --> 16:11.804
gave up halfway
through naming it.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.440
Uh... Camp Flabanabba!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.008
Mama's coming, baby.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.544
Mama's coming, and she cares
about your titties!

16:17.577 --> 16:20.947
They have
sweet smiggle honey cookies.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.017
Mmm! And low-calorie
petroleum flakes.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.218
Obviously cookies.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.453
Let's get you the flakes then.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.887
Okay, but it's not
what I wanted.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.389
Well, maybe next time,
you won't be

16:29.422 --> 16:31.791
such a dumb piece of shit
and you can pick for yourself.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.126
That's not nice.
What's that?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.028
Did you just have
a controversial thought?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.696
No.
That's what I thought,
bitch.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.698
You little punk-ass.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.467
This is the best.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.835
I agree.
You've made things even easier

16:42.869 --> 16:44.304
than if you hadn't
been incompetent.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.306
Uh-oh.
We get shoot-shoot now.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.641
**

16:48.675 --> 16:50.410
Man ♪1: All right, folks, if you
could please take your seats,

16:50.443 --> 16:52.079
we're about to enter
the wormhole.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.381
So, I hope everybody bought
a dinner first.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.815
Nice.
Nice.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.184
Jerry, step over there

16:57.217 --> 16:58.651
and lock yourself
in the escape pod.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.420
You're not killing us?
I'm killing Rick.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.056
You're free to go. You're
no threat to me or anyone.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.491
Now you're just being mean.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.059
Yeah, you're mean...
No offense.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.727
Mean would be
shooting you, Jerry.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.096
This is saving a bullet.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.730
Go back to
your quietly ashamed family

17:10.762 --> 17:12.083
and live out
the rest of your days

17:12.098 --> 17:13.733
in denial
of your vagina fantasies.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.669
It was a one-time thought
that everyone has!

17:17.904 --> 17:19.506
What are you doing?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.741
I'm being triumphantly brave!

17:21.773 --> 17:23.343
It's not triumphant or brave.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.676
You're not risking anything.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.845
You might shoot me.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.180
I think you know I won't.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.515
Because you know
I feel sorry for you.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.049
You're just doing this
so you can tell yourself

17:30.083 --> 17:31.451
you fought... Ow!

17:32.619 --> 17:34.521
Woman:
Temporal shield compromised.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.124
Congratulations, Jerry.
You get to die a man.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.591
Uh, that's okay!
I'll leave!

17:38.625 --> 17:41.594
Please don't shoot.
I-I'm the vagina guy, remember?

17:41.628 --> 17:45.532
**

17:45.565 --> 17:49.769
Whoa!
What is happening to me?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.771
Where is this?
Where am I?

17:51.804 --> 17:53.140
Am I dead?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.641
A-Am I... Am I still alive?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.377
Rick: Those aren't the questions
you should be asking.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.410
Huh?!

17:58.411 --> 17:59.512
Shh!

18:21.468 --> 18:24.103
Ah, got ya!

18:24.137 --> 18:25.572
Come here, you little pumpkin.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.974
I have shit on my ass.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.909
Whoa, oof this!

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
Who am I?

18:31.478 --> 18:32.945
Who am I?

18:32.979 --> 18:36.082
I'm time!
I'm literally time!

18:36.115 --> 18:41.454
All: Whooooa!

18:41.488 --> 18:42.789
Aah!

18:42.822 --> 18:45.525
Oh, God. I feel like
our souls were united,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.760
and we were all one
with eternity.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.262
Our body's unchanged,

18:49.296 --> 18:51.764
yet our minds have lived
a thousand lifetimes.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.800
Is that enough time
for me to forgive you?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.001
I don't know,
but it's enough time

18:55.034 --> 18:57.003
for a synaptic dampener
to wear off.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.510
He hadn't decided
he was still going to kill us!

19:03.543 --> 19:05.612
He was talking himself into it.
I've seen it before.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.448
Cosmic apotheosis wears off
faster than salvia.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.550
I'm starting to believe you
because I just finished merging

19:10.583 --> 19:12.519
with your essence
for an endless epoch,

19:12.552 --> 19:14.621
and I'm already back to thinking
you're an asshole.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.456
Fine with me.
Let's just go our separate ways.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.024
Sounds like you
and the word "epoch"

19:18.057 --> 19:19.226
have a lot of catching up to do.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.793
Wait, don't leave me!

19:20.827 --> 19:22.329
Man ♪1: All right, folks,
you're free to get up

19:22.362 --> 19:23.830
and walk around the cabin

19:23.863 --> 19:25.965
and maybe take the wormhole out
for breakfast.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.734
Man ♪2:
Okay, you can do the dinner one
or the breakfast one,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.269
but not both.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.139
You think you got that thing
figured out?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.341
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.343
Good.
Because I have an idea.

19:38.545 --> 19:42.148
It's actually a contraction
of "some" and "more,"

19:42.181 --> 19:43.583
you see that?
Oh, wow.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.684
I was way off.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.504
Morty, what's happening here?

20:04.537 --> 20:06.273
Summer got into
my grandpa's garage,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.675
messed around, and
turned herself into a monster.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.910
My mom did the same
to make her feel better.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.211
She's a good mom.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.284
Oh, my God.
I have to go call my mother!

20:17.317 --> 20:19.018
Tricia, wait!
Ethan! Ethan!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.020
Hey, it's okay.
Sit down.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.356
You made my sister cry, Ethan.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.957
You messed with her body image.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.125
Look, Morty, I...

20:26.158 --> 20:27.460
Shh, shh, shh.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.730
Careful, Ethan.
Your s'more is burning.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.942
Uh, I guess we better
get on the same page

20:42.975 --> 20:44.377
about our fake adventure.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.812
Right.
I'll make you a deal.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.380
I'll leave out the part
where you tried to murder me...

20:47.414 --> 20:48.815
And I'll leave out the part

20:48.848 --> 20:52.652
where you admitted
to sabotaging our marriage.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.786
You want to...?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.555
Nah, if the family
sees me like this,

20:55.588 --> 20:57.223
they'll feel sorry for me.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.726
Which is no longer
my signature move.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.794
Later days, amigo.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.232
Actually, I just realized,
I don't have my wallet,

21:06.265 --> 21:07.567
and my bus pass is in there,
so maybe...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.235
Stay strong, Jerry.
I believe in you!

21:17.944 --> 21:25.944
**

21:27.954 --> 21:35.954
**

21:37.964 --> 21:45.964
**

21:47.974 --> 21:49.542
**

21:49.576 --> 21:52.178
I tell you, fellas.
This is the life.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.813
It certainly is.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.014
To freedom!

21:57.016 --> 21:58.385
Ooh!
Looks like a 4-22.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.886
Ooh, a couple cranks
on scaling knob

21:59.919 --> 22:02.789
with a four dilabyte cross fade
would fix that in a jiff.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.525
Four? You'd be lucky
to clear 13% de-morphized

22:05.558 --> 22:06.959
with that kind of range.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.062
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what did we agree on?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.498
Together: No work talk!

22:11.531 --> 22:14.467
Let's just relax and enjoy
our retirement, shall...

22:14.501 --> 22:16.135
Oh, my God!

22:16.168 --> 22:17.770
Aaah!
