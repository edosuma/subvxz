WEBVTT

00:00.957 --> 00:02.480
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.656
SHAW: BOYS AND GIRLS,
MEET PLANET ALPHA.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.310
BELLAMY:
NOW, THAT'’S A VIEW.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.008
CLARKE: LOOKS LIKE
THE SUNS ARE ECLIPSING.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.748
5 MINUTES AGO, THIS THING
ATE A LEAF OUT OF MY HAND.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.186
NOW IT WANTS
TO EAT ME.

00:12.229 --> 00:15.493
SHAW: HERE. GAAH!
IT'’S RADIATION.

00:15.537 --> 00:18.844
TELL RAVEN SHE DESERVES
HAPPINESS.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.498
CLARKE: SO ANY GUESSES
WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE WENT?

00:20.542 --> 00:21.499
IT'’S SOME KIND
OF SHRINE...

00:21.543 --> 00:22.892
BELLAMY: ELIGIUS III.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.328
CLARKE:
ALL NAMED LIGHTBOURNE.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.677
- NICE TO BE REMEMBERED.
- OR WORSHIPPED.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.201
CLARKE, DID YOU
READ THIS?

00:27.244 --> 00:28.941
"WHEN STARS ALIGN
AND THE FOREST WAKES,

00:28.985 --> 00:30.552
IT'’S TIME
TO RUN AWAY."

00:30.595 --> 00:32.032
IT'’S NOT A NURSERY RHYME.
IT'’S A WARNING.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.425
NO, NO!
THEY'’RE STEALING OUR SHIP!

00:34.469 --> 00:35.600
EMORI: AAH!

00:35.644 --> 00:37.428
AGH!

00:37.472 --> 00:39.039
AAH!

00:39.082 --> 00:40.083
IT'’S IN THE AIR.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.738
AAH!

00:51.747 --> 00:53.357
I'’M ECLIPSING THE ECLIPSE.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.707
MAN: COME ON, JOSEPHINE.
DON'’T YOU HAVE WORK TO DO?

00:55.751 --> 00:57.187
I'’M DOING IT.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.972
OUR MISSION IS,
PHASE ONE--SURVIVE,

01:00.016 --> 01:02.714
PHASE TWO--POPULATE.

01:02.758 --> 01:06.066
WHAT DO YOU SAY, GABRIEL?
YOU READY FOR PHASE TWO?

01:06.109 --> 01:08.111
THAT'’S WHAT
THE EMBRYOS ARE FOR.

01:08.155 --> 01:11.549
FINE.
PLAY HARD TO GET.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.290
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'’RE
OBSESSED WITH ME.

01:13.334 --> 01:17.077
WOMAN: JOSEPHINE!
YOUR DAD'’S LOOKING FOR YOU!

01:33.484 --> 01:34.920
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.270
I AM PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF TALKING

01:36.313 --> 01:37.619
TO TALKING TO
MY DAUGHTER ALONE.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.230
UH-HUH, ALSO PERFECTLY
OVERPROTECTIVE

01:40.274 --> 01:42.667
AND POSSIBLY
MEGALOMANIACAL.

01:42.711 --> 01:43.973
"POSSIBLY"?

01:44.016 --> 01:46.018
STOP WITH THE HAIR.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.152
- DAD, BUSY.
- REALLY?

01:49.196 --> 01:52.112
HOW MANY SPECIES HAVE
YOU CATALOGED TODAY?

01:52.155 --> 01:55.506
17, STILL ONLY 3
EVOLUTIONARY BRANCHES--

01:55.550 --> 01:57.595
INSECT, RODENT,
AND REPTILE.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.945
A FEW OF THE WEIRDER ONES
ARE HARD TO CLASSIFY,

01:59.989 --> 02:04.124
SO I CREATED A NEW
TAXONOMIC CATEGORY--GUAIWU.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.301
- "GUAIWU"?
-FREAKS IN CHINESE.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.955
WELL, MANDARIN,
TO BE EXACT.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.784
ONE OF THEM EATS A BERRY THAT
TASTES LIKE COTTON CANDY.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.786
YOU TRIED IT?

02:14.830 --> 02:15.961
JOSIE, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I NEED TO TELL YOU--

02:16.005 --> 02:18.834
I DIDN'’T TRY IT.
I MADE THE KIDS DO IT.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.010
LEELEE LOVED IT.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.881
HOW LONG AGO?

02:22.925 --> 02:24.274
MOM, IF IT WERE POISONOUS,
THEY'’D BE DEAD BY NOW.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.625
MM-HMM.
I'’LL GO CHECK ON THEM.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.193
GET ME A SAMPLE
TO ANALYZE.

02:30.237 --> 02:34.023
WHAT?

02:34.066 --> 02:36.721
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I TOLD YOU

02:36.765 --> 02:39.071
WHY I BECAME
AN ASTRONOMER?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.899
OH, HERE WE GO. YES.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.163
YOU WANTED TO PROVE
THERE'’S NO GOD.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.555
TOO BAD NIETZSCHE
BEAT YOU TO IT

02:44.599 --> 02:46.731
WHEN HE SAID,
"GOTT IST TOT"--

02:46.775 --> 02:48.080
"GOD IS DEAD."

02:48.124 --> 02:49.734
CAN I GO NOW?

02:49.778 --> 02:51.649
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU

02:51.693 --> 02:54.304
THAT BEING HERE

02:54.348 --> 02:58.221
IN THIS
MIRACULOUS PLACE

02:58.265 --> 03:00.745
MAKES ME
QUESTION THAT?

03:03.226 --> 03:06.838
I'’D SAY,
NOT EVERYTHING

03:06.882 --> 03:08.884
THAT'’S MIRACULOUS
IS A MIRACLE.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.672
HEY, GIVE DR. SANTIAGO
SOME SPACE, OK?

03:14.716 --> 03:16.500
I'’M SERIOUS, KIDDO.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.850
WE'’RE BUILDING A SANCTUARY
FOR THE HUMAN RACE HERE.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.765
LAST THING I NEED IS
A BROKENHEARTED GENETICIST.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.377
COPY?

03:28.991 --> 03:31.863
I HAVE NAME
FOR THIS PLACE.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.213
I DON'’T KNOW.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.432
I THINK ALPHA IS
PRETTY HARD TO BEAT.

03:35.476 --> 03:40.785
THE LATIN ROOT OF
"SANCTUARY"--"SANCTUM."

03:40.829 --> 03:43.701
JOSEPHINE ADA LIGHTBOURNE,

03:43.745 --> 03:45.790
I DO BELIEVE YOU JUST
NAMED OUR NEW WORLD.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.924
HA HA HA!

03:48.967 --> 03:51.187
SERIOUS ABOUT
GABRIEL, KIDDO.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.237
OH. MM.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.590
- WHAT'’S WRONG?
- QUIET.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.166
NO INSECT SOUNDS.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.994
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:16.038 --> 04:18.258
10:1 IT'’S THE ECLIPSE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.086
ANIMAL BEHAVIOR ON EARTH
IS AFFECTED BY THEM, TOO.

04:21.130 --> 04:25.090
CRICKETS GO SILENT WHEN
THEY FEEL THREATENED,

04:25.134 --> 04:26.788
RIGHT BEFORE
THEY SWARM.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.661
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.315
I DON'’T KNOW,
BUT IT'’S CLOSE.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.448
WE HAVE TO GET
BACK TO CAMP.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.114
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.768
NO ONE HAS.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.770
IT WAS A SONIC ANOMALY
PROBABLY CAUSED

04:52.814 --> 04:55.120
BY MOLECULAR VIBRATIONS
IN THE AIR AND TREES.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.992
WHERE'’S MY DAD? HE'LL KNOW
WHAT I'’M TALKING ABOUT.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.957
JOSEPHINE: MOM? MOM!

05:09.178 --> 05:11.354
MOM, MOM...

05:24.019 --> 05:25.368
JOSEPHINE: DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.022
SANCTUM IS MINE.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.332
OH, MY--

05:34.246 --> 05:35.987
MAN: LET'’S GET
OUT OF HERE.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.686
DAD:
SANCTUM IS MINE.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.689
- AH!
- RUN. RUN!

05:45.910 --> 05:47.216
AGH!

05:56.747 --> 05:59.228
- OHH!
- SANCTUM IS MINE!

06:50.627 --> 06:53.282
I AM GETTING USED TO
PATCHING YOU UP, MURPHY.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.241
BELLAMY: I GUESS NOW WE KNOW
WHAT THE RESTRAINTS WERE FOR.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.634
ECHO: HOW LONG
WILL SHE BE OUT?

06:57.678 --> 06:58.766
THE SEDATIVE
IN THE TRANQ-STICKS

06:58.809 --> 07:00.420
SHOULD LAST
UP TO 3 HOURS.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.247
MILLER: HEY, WHAT ABOUT
THE MOTHERSHIP?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.597
THEY'’RE GONNA THINK IT'S US.
HOW DO WE WARN THEM?

07:03.640 --> 07:04.902
WE DON'’T. RADIOS
DON'’T WORK DOWN HERE.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.251
FOR NOW, WE WORRY
ABOUT OURSELVES.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.992
MURPHY, ARE YOU OK?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.472
JACKSON: HIS WOUNDS
ARE SUPERFICIAL.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.995
- YOU'’RE LUCKY.
- I'’M LUCKY? SORRY.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.606
IS THAT YOUR
PROFESSIONAL DIAGNOSIS?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.085
BECAUSE IF SO, YOU SUCK
AT BEING A DOCTOR.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.827
- MURPHY--
- WHAT? NO. WHAT?

07:16.871 --> 07:18.263
I'’M DYING TO KNOW
WHAT HE THINKS

07:18.307 --> 07:19.439
TURNED MY GIRLFRIEND
INTO THE MONSTER

07:19.482 --> 07:20.744
THAT JUST
ATTACKED ME.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.093
CLARKE: IT'’S ALL
RIGHT HERE.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.443
"FOR TWO DAYS,
HEAVEN IS HELL,

07:23.486 --> 07:25.749
AND FRIENDS
BECOME FOES."

07:25.793 --> 07:27.795
WHATEVER IS IN THE AIR,
IT AFFECTS PEOPLE, TOO.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.144
WHY ARE THE REST
OF US OK?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.319
I DON'’T KNOW,
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS,

07:30.362 --> 07:32.495
IS COMES
FROM THE PLANTS.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.757
- IT'’S A CHILDREN'S BOOK.
- YEAH, BUT IT'’S COMING TRUE.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.585
WHEN WE WERE
RUNNING FROM THE BUGS,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.326
EMORI WENT DOWN
IN THE BRUSH.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.284
IT'’S PROBABLY WHY
SHE LOST IT FIRST.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.286
- "FIRST"?
- WE'’RE ALL BREATHING IT IN.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.463
IF IT'’S THE AIR OUT THERE,
THEN WE'’LL STAY IN HERE.

07:43.506 --> 07:46.509
- WE ARE GONNA RIDE IT OUT.
- THAT'’S A GREAT PLAN, MILLER.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
MURPHY: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE'’RE TRAPPED IN HERE

07:48.163 --> 07:50.339
AND THE REST OF US
LOSE OUR MINDS?

07:50.382 --> 07:52.167
BELLAMY: MURPHY'’S RIGHT.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.169
THERE'’S MORE RESTRAINTS
IN SCHOOL.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.823
I'’M GUESSING
THEY'’RE EVERYWHERE.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.520
WE NEED TO SEPARATE.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.348
I'’LL STAY WITH EMORI.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.535
TRYING TO KEEP THE AIR
OUT IS POINTLESS, MURPHY.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.145
KIND OF LIKE TRYING
TO SURVIVE BY LOCKING

08:14.189 --> 08:16.539
YOURSELF UP WITH
THE COMMANDER OF DEATH?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.846
OF COURSE, YOU
DON'’T REALLY NEED

08:18.889 --> 08:21.065
AIRBORNE TOXINS TO
TURN ON YOUR FRIENDS,

08:21.109 --> 08:23.415
DO YOU, CLARKE?

08:26.680 --> 08:29.900
OK. ECHO'’S WITH EMORI.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.859
JACKSON IS WITH MILLER
UPSTAIRS.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.557
NO ONE'’S ARMED.
NOW IT'’S OUR TURN.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.864
GUN.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.480
WHAT'’D I MISS?

08:47.265 --> 08:51.879
OK. CONSIDER THIS TIME TO
WORK OUT YOUR DIFFERENCES.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.228
UHH...

08:54.577 --> 08:56.710
BELLAMY:
LET'’S DO THIS.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.062
NOW, MURPHY.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.117
WHY DO YOU GET TO KEEP
EVERYONE'’S KEYS?

09:13.161 --> 09:16.773
BELLAMY: RELAX.
CLARKE WILL HAVE MINE.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.214
SATISFIED?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.260
I GUESS SO,
AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE

09:25.303 --> 09:26.914
WHO LIVE HERE
DON'’T COME HOME

09:26.957 --> 09:29.917
AFTER THEY KILL EVERYBODY
ON THE MOTHERSHIP.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.574
NICE ONE, MURPHY.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.497
UH!

09:45.541 --> 09:47.499
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

09:47.543 --> 09:50.111
FIGHT. HUH! UH!

09:50.154 --> 09:52.592
YOU'’VE BEEN
ASLEEP TOO LONG.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.636
YOU CALL THAT
A PUNCH?

09:53.680 --> 09:56.639
YUH! UH! UH! UH!

09:56.683 --> 09:59.990
BETTER.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.297
- UH!
- YUH!

10:02.340 --> 10:04.516
UH! YAH!

10:06.649 --> 10:09.391
ARE YOU OK?

10:11.306 --> 10:14.309
UH! UH! UH! UH!

10:14.352 --> 10:16.616
- UH! UH!
- OCTAVIA, STOP!

10:16.659 --> 10:18.966
UH! UH! UH! UH! UH!

10:22.012 --> 10:25.276
VOICE: TRANSPORT SHIP DOCKING,
TERMINAL "B."

10:25.320 --> 10:29.063
AUTO-PROCEDURE ENGAGED.

10:31.979 --> 10:35.330
VOICE: TRANSPORT SHIP SECURE.
AIRLOCK ENGAGED.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.506
WHY ARE THEY
BACK SO SOON?

10:37.549 --> 10:39.639
JORDAN: WE DON'’T KNOW--
THERE'’S NO COMMS--

10:39.682 --> 10:43.773
BUT IT CAN'’T BE GOOD.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.557
VOICE: AIRLOCK IS SECURE.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.566
JORDAN: GET OUT
OF THE WAY.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.481
I CAN'’T BREATHE.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.187
HER HAND.

11:10.582 --> 11:13.324
RED BLOOD.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.675
PASS OUT THE WEAPONS
AND SECURE THE SHIP.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.165
ONLY WAY TO OPEN THAT DOOR NOW
IS FROM THE BRIDGE.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.211
WHOEVER THEY ARE,
THEY KNOW THE SHIP.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.169
ABBY: AND HOW TO
FLY THE TRANSPORT,

11:32.213 --> 11:34.519
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND?

11:34.563 --> 11:37.522
THERE WERE
ONLY 4 OF THEM.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.700
OCTAVIA: GET OUT,
WE TAKE THE BRIDGE,

11:40.743 --> 11:42.005
WE GO TO THE GROUND.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.572
JORDAN:
WE CAN'’T GET OUT.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.834
THIS MESS HALL WAS DESIGNED
TO LOCK DOWN

11:44.878 --> 11:46.880
THE PRISONERS
IN AN EMERGENCY.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.533
OCTAVIA: WE'’LL
SEE ABOUT THAT.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.927
JAMES, YOU WERE AN
APPRENTICE TO YOUR MOTHER.

11:50.971 --> 11:55.584
SHE KEPT THAT BUNKER RUNNING
LONG AFTER JAHA DIED.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.239
SHE TOLD ME YOU'’RE
A BETTER ENGINEER THAN HER.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.197
YOU CAN
FLOAT YOURSELF.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.590
YOU KILLED MY MOTHER
WHEN YOU BURNT THE FARM

12:01.633 --> 12:03.548
AND FORCED US TO MARCH
INTO A MASSACRE.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.768
YOU THINK YOU CAN
TO THIS WITHOUT ME?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.553
WITHOUT ME,
YOU'’RE NOTHING.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.295
ABBY: OCTAVIA--
JAMES, JAMES, IT'’S OK.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.737
WE DON'’T NEED
AN ENGINEER IN HERE

12:17.780 --> 12:20.783
BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE
OUT THERE.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.959
THEY DIDN'’T
FIND RAVEN.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.139
COME ON.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.930
WAKE UP.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.497
I CANNOT BELIEVE
I'’M DOING THIS.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.109
YET YOU ARE.

12:42.152 --> 12:46.243
HOW BAD IS IT?
SAVE THE DETAILS.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.289
SHE KICKED.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.813
WE'’VE BEEN HIJACKED,
4 PEOPLE IN NEOPRENE SUITS

12:50.857 --> 12:52.641
WITH BREATHING
REGULATORS.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.425
WEAPONS?

12:54.469 --> 12:55.905
THEY'’RE USING GAS GRENADES
TO MOVE OUR PEOPLE

12:55.949 --> 12:57.515
TO THE MESS HALL, BUT,
YEAH, THEY HAVE WEAPONS.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.995
IF THEY'’RE KEEPING US
IN THE MESS HALL,

12:59.039 --> 13:00.692
THAT MEANS THEY
CONTROL THE BRIDGE.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.607
IT ALSO MEANS THEY KNOW
YOU JUST WOKE ME UP.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.393
EXACTLY. WE HAVE
TO MOVE NOW.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.659
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.974
MAN: GOOD. WE'’RE IN TIME.
SHE HASN'’T THAWED YET.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.714
I'’LL PUT HER
BACK UNDER.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.676
- AGH! GO!
- AGH!

13:30.984 --> 13:34.291
I'’LL TAKE THOSE DETAILS NOW.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.567
MURPHY: GOD, I HATE
BEING TIED UP,

13:49.611 --> 13:52.875
YET SOMEHOW WHENEVER
I'’M WITH YOU,

13:52.919 --> 13:55.486
SOONER OR LATER, WE
WIND UP HERE, DON'’T WE?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.575
I MEAN, FIRST,
YOU HANGED ME.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.708
WELL, IN FAIRNESS,
I DID THAT.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.537
ONLY AFTER SHE
FORCED YOUR HAND,

14:02.580 --> 14:04.974
AND WHO COULD
FORGET LEXA?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.584
YEAH. I WAS TIED UP
THAT NIGHT, TOO,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.891
JUST A DISPOSABLE
PAWN IN YOUR GAME.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
THAT'’S NOT FAIR.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.677
NEITHER WAS TYING UP
ME AND EMORI

14:12.721 --> 14:15.158
IN BECCA'’S LAB, BUT SHE
WAS DISPOSABLE, TOO, RIGHT?

14:15.202 --> 14:16.681
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER
THAT ONE, CLARKE,

14:16.725 --> 14:17.769
BECAUSE YOU DREW
A LITTLE PICTURE OF IT

14:17.813 --> 14:19.510
IN YOUR MEMORY BOOK.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.077
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.513
DID YOU DRAW A
PICTURE OF BELLAMY

14:22.557 --> 14:23.906
IN THE FIGHTING
PIT, TOO?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.342
BELLAMY: OK, MURPHY.
THAT'’S ENOUGH.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.867
DON'’T MAKE ME
GAG YOU, TOO.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.869
OW!

14:29.912 --> 14:31.044
JACKSON CAN TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK

14:31.087 --> 14:32.567
AT THE WOUND
IN THE MORNING.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.916
OH, IT'’S NOT
FROM THE KNIFE.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.526
IT'’S FROM THE BULLET
WOUNDS THAT I TOOK

14:35.570 --> 14:36.788
FROM SAVING BELLAMY'’S
LIFE FROM THOSE

14:36.832 --> 14:38.225
ARMED PSYCHOPATHS
YOU PUT

14:38.268 --> 14:39.704
BACK IN
THE BATTLEFIELD.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.881
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
WANT FROM ME, MURPHY?

14:41.924 --> 14:45.014
I'’M SORRY, OK,
FOR ALL OF IT.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.190
I NEVER MEANT
FOR YOU TO GET HURT,

14:47.234 --> 14:50.715
BUT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
SOMEONE ALWAYS DOES.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.587
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR,

14:52.630 --> 14:54.415
THAT I'’M THE BAD GUY?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.939
FINE. I'’LL BE
THE BAD GUY.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.899
WHEN I'’M IN CHARGE,
PEOPLE DIE.

14:59.942 --> 15:04.077
ISN'’T THAT
WHAT YOU SAID?

15:05.774 --> 15:08.429
SATISFIED?

15:08.472 --> 15:10.431
IT'’S A START.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.607
MILLER: AAGH! MAKE IT STOP!

15:12.650 --> 15:14.957
IT'’S MILLER.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.916
MILLER, WHAT'’S WRONG?

15:16.959 --> 15:18.743
- HELP!
- JACKSON?

15:18.787 --> 15:19.919
CLARKE, I GOT TO GET
UP THERE NOW.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.922
HAND ME MY KEY NOW.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.445
FINE, BUT I'’M
GOING WITH YOU.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.100
THROW ME MINE.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.929
JACKSON, USE THE TRANQS.
WE DIVVIED THEM UP FOR A REASON.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.497
MILLER: AAGH! AAH!

15:33.541 --> 15:35.935
HEY, WE'’RE COMING!

15:35.978 --> 15:37.937
HEY! WHAT ABOUT ME?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.245
BELLAMY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

15:42.289 --> 15:43.943
ECHO, IT'’S OK.
WE'’VE GOT THIS.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.683
JACKSON,
OPEN THE DOOR.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.250
UH! UH!

15:47.294 --> 15:50.297
JACKSON, OPEN THE DOOR.
JACKSON, OPEN THE DOOR.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.257
THE BUGS,
THEY'’RE INSIDE HIM.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.607
CLARKE: WHAT? HEY, HEY.
DID YOU SEE THEM?

15:56.651 --> 15:58.696
BELLAMY: MILLER STOP
SO WE CAN HELP YOU.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.263
JACKSON: MILLER AND I WAS
TALKING ABOUT THE TERRARIUM

16:00.307 --> 16:01.525
AND HOW I THINK THE BUGS
ARE AN EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM

16:01.569 --> 16:03.266
LIKE THE CANARIES
IN A COALMINE.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.615
NATE OPENED IT,
AND THEY MUST HAVE GOTTEN OUT.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.095
THEY'’RE DEAD
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.097
JUST UNHOOK ME SO
I CAN EXAMINE HIM.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.664
CUT ME! YOU GOT
TO CUT IT OUT!

16:09.707 --> 16:12.972
GOT TO CUT IT OUT!
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY ARMS.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.148
GOT TO CUT
IT OUT, DOC.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.671
NATE, NATE,
I'’M HERE. I'M HERE.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.977
HURRY. THEY'’RE
CRAWLING UP MY ARM.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.021
HURRY, BEFORE THEY
REACH MY TORSO.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.457
I CAN'’T DIE
LIKE OKIBA.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.024
JACKSON: SCALPEL,
IT'’S NOT HERE.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.460
CLARKE: BELLAMY,
I DON'’T THINK THIS IS REAL.

16:23.504 --> 16:27.638
MILLER: I FEEL IT.
AAH! AAGH! RRGH!

16:27.682 --> 16:30.641
BELLAMY: JACKSON, NO.
WHAT ARE YOU--UH!

16:30.685 --> 16:34.994
MILLER: RRGH!
AAH! AAGH!

16:35.037 --> 16:36.821
- I SEE IT.
- JACKSON!

16:38.084 --> 16:40.042
- I GOT YOU.
- GET IT!

16:40.086 --> 16:41.478
CLARKE: STOP! DOC!

16:41.522 --> 16:46.396
- AAH!
- DOC! TRANQ HIM!

16:49.965 --> 16:51.749
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW TWO PEOPLE

16:51.793 --> 16:54.883
CAN HAVE THE SAME
HALLUCINATION?

16:54.926 --> 16:57.625
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW
TO SURVIVE DOWN HERE.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.412
MURPHY!
SON OF A BITCH.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.027
BELLAMY:
HE TOOK THE GUNS.

17:10.594 --> 17:15.077
OK. THEY'’RE ALL CRAZY.
YOU'’RE OK.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.868
BELLAMY: MURPHY,
WHERE ARE YOU?

17:23.912 --> 17:27.307
CLARKE: MURPHY,
COME BACK, PLEASE.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.446
BELLAMY:
ECHO, OPEN UP. IT'’S ME.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.058
BELLAMY?

17:39.101 --> 17:41.190
BELLAMY:
ECHO, OPEN UP.

17:41.234 --> 17:44.063
DON'’T YOU OPEN
THAT DOOR! AH!

17:44.106 --> 17:45.890
- CALM DOWN.
- HE'’LL KILL US ALL.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.457
ECHO, LET ME IN.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.198
ECHO: BELLAMY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:49.242 --> 17:50.808
- YOU'’RE SUPPOSED TO BE INSIDE.
- MURPHY'’S LOOSE.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.072
HE'’S TAKEN THE GUNS.
I THINK HE MAY COME FOR EMORI.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.117
CLARKE: ECHO'’S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD GO BACK INSIDE.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.076
- HE CAN'’T SHOOT US THERE.
- NO.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.729
YOU NEED TO GO
BACK TO THE SCHOOL

17:58.773 --> 18:00.253
AND SEE IF HE LEFT
ANY WEAPONS,

18:00.296 --> 18:04.300
AND YOU NEED TO OPEN
THIS DAMN DOOR!

18:04.344 --> 18:07.086
TELL ME WHY.
WHAT'’S HAPPENING?

18:07.129 --> 18:08.957
WE USED OUR TRANQS
ON MILLER AND JACKSON,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.741
AND I NEED YOURS
FOR MURPHY.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.440
ECHO: MILLER AND JACKSON OK?
WE HEARD SCREAMS.

18:13.483 --> 18:17.792
YEAH. THEY'’RE FINE.
JUST LET ME IN!

18:17.835 --> 18:20.838
EMORI: YEAH. THAT'’S RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOU'’RE TOLD.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.753
- THAT'’S ALL YOU EVER DO...
- SHUT UP.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.756
- THE GOOD, LITTLE SPY...
- SHUT UP SO I CAN THINK.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.498
ALWAYS FOLLOWING
HER MASTER'’S VOICE.

18:28.542 --> 18:32.850
I SAID SHUT UP!
SHUT UP! UH! RRGH!

18:32.894 --> 18:34.504
HA HA HA!

18:34.548 --> 18:36.115
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, ECHO?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.594
BELLAMY--

18:37.638 --> 18:41.685
JUST WAIT, CLARKE.
ECHO, NOW!

18:41.729 --> 18:44.471
VOICES:
I WON'’T TOLERATE WEAKNESS.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.646
BETRAY THEM ALL.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.256
DON'’T YOU DARE CRY.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.606
A SPY MUST CARRY OUT ORDERS
WITHOUT QUESTION.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.130
BRING ME HER HEAD.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.132
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.959
CLARKE: ECHO, DON'’T LISTEN
TO HIM. HE'’S LOSING IT, TOO.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.526
OPEN THE DOOR.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.875
VOICES: SLIT HER THROAT.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.616
SLIT HER THROAT.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.531
BRING ME HER HEAD.

19:01.575 --> 19:07.058
BELLAMY, I'’M SORRY.
I CAN'’T.

19:07.102 --> 19:10.192
HA HA HA!

19:13.543 --> 19:15.893
YOU LOSE, JOHN.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.809
YOU LOSE.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.724
CLARKE:
BELLAMY, IT'’S OK.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.465
THE TOXIN
IS AFFECTING YOU.

19:22.509 --> 19:26.382
NOW JUST COME WITH ME
BACK TO THE SCHOOL SO--

19:26.426 --> 19:29.298
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'’T
NOTICED, CLARKE,

19:29.342 --> 19:31.866
BUT I DON'’T
NEED YOU ANYMORE.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.530
MURPHY!

19:44.879 --> 19:46.968
MURPHY!

19:56.238 --> 19:57.718
THANK YOU, JORDAN.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.246
- I'’LL DO.
- WAIT.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.249
ABBY: SERVING OCTAVIA IS WHAT
GOT US HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.731
YOU LET ME.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.219
SHOULD I
DRINK IT FIRST?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.920
WE'’VE EATEN WORSE.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.753
IF YOU WANT MY HELP
GETTING US OUT OF HERE,

20:32.796 --> 20:35.146
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.540
I CAME OVER HERE
TO WARN YOU.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.716
ALL THESE PEOPLE
ARE FROM THE ARK,

20:39.760 --> 20:42.589
AND THEY HAVE ALL LOST
LOVED ONES IN PRAIMFAYA.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.069
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.464
THEY BLAME ME
FOR THEIR SINS,

20:48.508 --> 20:50.945
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.599
YES.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.125
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
IS THAT I REGRET IT.

20:59.345 --> 21:03.436
YOU ONLY REGRET
HAVING LOST.

21:03.479 --> 21:08.267
I ONLY LOST BECAUSE KANE
SOLD US OUT TO DIYOZA

21:08.310 --> 21:12.096
AND YOU AND CLARKE
HEALED HER MEN.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.185
IF NOT FOR YOU,
I WOULD HAVE DELIVERED US

21:14.229 --> 21:16.405
SAFELY TO THAT VALLEY.

21:16.449 --> 21:20.931
OUR SINS WOULD HAVE
BEEN WASHED AWAY.

21:20.975 --> 21:24.283
MCCREARY AND DIYOZA WOULD
HAVE SURRENDERED TO ME.

21:24.326 --> 21:28.199
EVERYTHING I DID
WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.987
NOW NOTHING DOES.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.035
- OCTAVIA--
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

21:46.827 --> 21:48.872
IT'’S OK.

21:59.405 --> 22:03.974
SO BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT?

22:04.018 --> 22:06.063
RAVEN: MAYBE IF YOU
LEFT ONE OF THEM ALIVE,

22:06.107 --> 22:07.891
YOU COULD'’VE
ASKED THEM.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.462
"DANGEROUS CURVES AHEAD."

22:13.506 --> 22:16.378
DIYOZA: NICE TOY,
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,

22:16.422 --> 22:19.816
YOU AND SHAW
MAKE A GOOD COUPLE.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.558
YOU'’RE BOTH SOFT,

22:22.602 --> 22:25.082
BUT THAT'’S WHY
YOU WOKE ME.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.824
I WOKE YOU BECAUSE YOU
TOOK THE BRIDGE ONCE ALREADY

22:27.868 --> 22:29.391
AND WE NEED
TO DO IT AGAIN.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.914
WE USED A HYDRAZINE BOMB

22:30.958 --> 22:32.916
TO BLOW THE STARBOARD
ENGINE AS A DISTRACTION.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.353
WHILE THEY WERE
FIGHTING THE FIRE,

22:34.396 --> 22:35.832
WE TOOK THE BRIDGE
IN A DIRECT ASSAULT,

22:35.876 --> 22:38.052
KILLING EVERY MEMBER
OF THE CREW EXCEPT SHAW.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.402
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.057
I FIGURE YOU WANT TO
DO SOMETHING QUIETER.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.275
QUIETER
WOULD BE GOOD.

22:44.319 --> 22:48.105
SEE? SOFT.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.499
HELLO THERE,
FELLOW HIJACKERS.

22:50.543 --> 22:51.761
I'’M GUESSING
YOU'’RE WONDERING

22:51.805 --> 22:53.023
WHERE YOUR MEN ARE.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.416
YOU CAN'’T LEVERAGE
DEAD PEOPLE.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.114
YOU CAN IF THEY
DON'’T KNOW THEY'RE DEAD.

22:57.158 --> 23:01.205
WOMAN, ON RADIO:
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

23:01.249 --> 23:03.382
THIS IS A WOMAN
HOLDING A GUN

23:03.425 --> 23:05.601
TO A HANDSOME, OLDER
GENTLEMAN'’S HEAD.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.212
YOU HAVE 3 SECONDS TO
DECIDE HOW THIS ENDS.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.606
EITHER YOU STAND DOWN AND
WE TALK ABOUT BEING FRIENDS

23:10.650 --> 23:12.216
OR I KILL
THE FIRST HOSTAGE.

23:12.260 --> 23:16.873
1, 2, 3. BAD CHOICE.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.875
NOW FOR
THE YOUNG '’UN.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.530
- 1, 2--
- WAIT.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.880
NO MORE WAITING.
HERE'’S HOW THIS GOES.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.056
YOU LET OUR PEOPLE
OUT OF THE MESS HALL

23:26.100 --> 23:28.711
AND MOVE INTO THE CORRIDOR
OUTSIDE THE BRIDGE UNARMED.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.887
YOU DO THAT, AND
THE 3 OF YOU WILL LIVE.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.454
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.021
I'’LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO TALK IT OUT.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.981
PUT ON THE YOUNG
ONE'’S SUIT.

23:38.025 --> 23:41.071
WHAT? WHY?

23:41.115 --> 23:43.160
BECAUSE YOU'’RE GONNA
BE HIM. THAT'’S WHY.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.293
WOMAN, ON RADIO:
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.948
IF MY HUSBAND ISN'’T BACK
ON THIS BRIDGE IN 10 MINUTES,

23:47.991 --> 23:50.472
I VENT THE OXYGEN
FROM THE MESS HALL.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.432
I'’LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO TALK IT OUT.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.434
I LIKE HER STYLE.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.566
- HUSBAND?
- THAT'’S UNFORTUNATE.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.264
IT MEANS SHE'’S
NOT BLUFFING.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.005
HOW MUCH TO YOU CARE ABOUT
THE PEOPLE IN THE MESS?

24:02.049 --> 24:04.268
WE'’RE NOT
LETTING THEM DIE.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.358
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER
WAY ONTO THE BRIDGE.

24:07.402 --> 24:08.969
WHAT ABOUT
THE AIR VENTS?

24:09.012 --> 24:10.318
WE CONSIDERED THAT
BEFORE GOING

24:10.361 --> 24:12.102
WITH THE
KILL-EVERYONE PLAN.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.495
THE AIR DUCTS LEADING
TO THE BRIDGE

24:13.539 --> 24:14.844
ARE TOO SMALL
FOR EITHER OF US,

24:14.888 --> 24:16.280
SO UNLESS YOU CAN
SHRINK YOURSELF DOWN

24:16.324 --> 24:17.804
TO THE SIZE
OF A SMALL CHILD,

24:17.847 --> 24:19.283
PUT ON THE DAMN SUIT,
AND LET'’S GO MEET

24:19.327 --> 24:21.198
YOUR NEW WIFE.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.939
WOMAN, ON RADIO:
THAT'’S LONG ENOUGH.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.028
10 MINUTES, OR EVERYONE
IN THE MESS HALL DIES.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.813
TICK TOCK.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.658
HMM...MM!

24:48.051 --> 24:50.880
UH!

24:50.924 --> 24:52.316
UH!

24:53.579 --> 24:56.146
UH! UH!

24:56.190 --> 24:59.019
UH! RRGH! UH!

24:59.062 --> 25:02.022
- HEY--
- UH!

25:02.065 --> 25:06.243
- HEY, YOU OK?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:06.287 --> 25:09.159
JORDAN: IT'’S NO USE. MY FATHER
ONCE TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT HOW--

25:09.203 --> 25:11.161
YOUR FATHER
WAS A COWARD, TOO.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.251
RRGH! HAH!

25:14.295 --> 25:17.428
MY FATHER SAVED US ALL.

25:17.472 --> 25:21.258
WRONG.
I DID THAT.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.700
LOOK AT YOURSELVES.

25:27.743 --> 25:33.053
I MADE YOU ALL INTO WONKRU
WARRIORS, FIGHTERS.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.534
I GAVE YOU SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.884
WHAT ARE YOU NOW?

25:39.407 --> 25:42.192
YOU'’RE COWARDS.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.542
UH!

25:47.633 --> 25:50.200
WELL?

25:50.244 --> 25:52.202
- UH!
- OOH! HUH!

25:52.246 --> 25:54.030
UH! UH! UH!

25:54.074 --> 25:56.293
NIYLAH: JAMES! NO!

25:56.337 --> 25:57.904
UH!

25:57.947 --> 26:01.037
NIYLAH: NO! STOP IT.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.909
UH!

26:05.999 --> 26:07.261
NIYLAH: ABBY, STOP THIS.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.479
YOU'’RE GIVING HER
WHAT SHE WANTS.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.047
CAN'’T YOU SEE THAT?

26:11.091 --> 26:14.224
STOP!

26:14.268 --> 26:17.053
UH! HA!

26:17.097 --> 26:20.056
STOP!

26:20.100 --> 26:22.319
JAMES: UH!

26:22.363 --> 26:25.714
UHH...

26:25.758 --> 26:29.283
- THE QUEEN IS DEAD.
- WAIT!

26:35.463 --> 26:38.335
LET HER LIVE WITH
WHAT SHE'’S BECOME.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.821
G'’UH!

26:47.170 --> 26:49.608
COWARD.

26:49.651 --> 26:55.309
YOU WANT ABSOLUTION?
TAKE IT. TAKE IT.

26:59.530 --> 27:04.405
PLEASE. PLEASE DO IT.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.236
ABBY, ON RADIO: CLARKE?
CLARKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

27:54.585 --> 27:56.500
CLARKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

27:56.544 --> 28:00.330
MOM? ARE YOU OK?

28:00.374 --> 28:03.333
YES. RAVEN FINALLY
FIGURED OUT THE RADIOS.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.900
WHAT'’S HAPPENED?

28:04.944 --> 28:06.989
I WAS SO SCARED WHEN
YOU DIDN'’T COME BACK.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.905
MOM, IT'’S NOT
SAFE DOWN HERE.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.342
THE ECLIPSE CAUSES THE PLANTS
TO RELEASE A TOXIN

28:12.386 --> 28:14.388
THAT AFFECTS
OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.173
TOXIN?

28:17.217 --> 28:19.698
CLARKE, ARE YOU SURE
IT'’S NOT JUST YOU?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.830
NO. NO. IT AFFECTS
ALL OF US, I MEAN,

28:21.874 --> 28:23.702
SOME OF US
WORSE THAN OTHERS.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.529
YOU DON'’T UNDERSTAND.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.358
I'’M NOT SAYING
YOU'’RE IMAGINING IT.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.970
I'’M SAYING
THE TOXIN IS YOU.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.366
THINK ABOUT IT.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.760
NO ONE IS SAFE AROUND YOU
BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE

28:38.804 --> 28:42.285
YOU WON'’T KILL DIE, ANYWAY,
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.766
YOUR FATHER DIED BECAUSE
HE NEEDED HIS LITTLE GIRL

28:44.810 --> 28:47.421
TO KNOW HE WAS
A GOOD GUY.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.728
LEXA DIED
FOR THE SAME REASON.

28:49.771 --> 28:54.297
YOU INFECT PEOPLE,
CLARKE, AND MADI IS NEXT.

28:54.341 --> 28:58.475
NO. NO. I WON'’T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

28:58.519 --> 29:02.088
THERE'’S ONLY ONE
WAY TO STOP IT.

29:02.131 --> 29:05.395
HOW?

29:05.439 --> 29:08.616
TAKE OUT THE KNIFE.

29:13.447 --> 29:17.407
GOOD. NOW PUT IT
TO YOUR THROAT.

29:17.451 --> 29:21.281
IF YOU'’RE GONE, SHE CAN'T
DIE TRYING TO SAVE YOU.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.979
I'’D DO IT FOR YOU.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.460
MAYBE YOU DON'’T
REALLY LOVE HER.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.592
I DO. I--

29:37.514 --> 29:40.779
THAT'’S IT.
YOU HAVE TO CUT DEEP.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.825
MAKE SURE YOU
SEVER THE CAROTID.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.350
COME ON, CLARKE.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.918
I KNOW I TOLD YOU THAT
THERE WERE NO GOOD GUYS,

29:49.962 --> 29:53.269
BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT WAS
A LIE TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.837
THERE ARE
GOOD GUYS, CLARKE.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.621
YOU'’RE JUST NOT
ONE OF THEM.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.801
MURPHY: WELL,
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.022
COME ON.
NOT YOU, TOO.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.503
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN, OR
I PUT ONE IN YOUR LEG.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.201
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, CLARKE?

30:12.245 --> 30:13.812
COME ON. DON'’T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.161
AS MUCH FUN AS IT
WOULD BE TO SHOOT YOU,

30:15.204 --> 30:16.292
BELLAMY
WOULD HEAR IT.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.685
DON'’T
LISTEN TO HIM.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.166
CUT DEEP.
DO IT NOW.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.950
HEY, HEY, CLARKE,
CLARKE, LISTEN TO ME.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.300
YOU'’RE SPEAKING INTO A
RADIO WITH THE POWER OFF.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.302
SEE? THERE'’S NO
INDICATOR LIGHT.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.651
NO, CLARKE.
DO IT NOW.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.524
BELLAMY:
MURPHY!

30:30.567 --> 30:34.484
CLARKE, DO IT.

30:34.528 --> 30:37.183
CLARKE--

30:39.446 --> 30:41.970
GOOD CHOICE.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.364
NOW, SINCE YOU'’RE CLEARLY
ONLY A THREAT TO YOURSELF

30:44.407 --> 30:45.974
AND NOT TO ME,
WHAT DO YOU SAY

30:46.018 --> 30:49.369
WE SAVE BELLAMY BEFORE
HE KILLS BOTH OF US?

30:55.810 --> 30:58.769
DIYOZA: DON'’T SAY A WORD.
WE JUST NEED TO BUY SOME TIME.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.033
WHERE'’S DANIEL?
DID YOU KILL HIM?

31:01.076 --> 31:04.079
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE.
YOU CAN STILL SAVE YOUR HUSBAND.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.515
WHY IS HE
WEARING A HELMET?

31:05.559 --> 31:06.995
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING A HELMET?

31:07.039 --> 31:08.562
IN CASE YOU USE THE GAS.
TAKE OFF HIS HELMET.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.521
- YOU TAKE OFF YOURS.
- I SAID, TAKE IT OFF NOW!

31:11.565 --> 31:15.525
- LET ME SEE HIS FACE.
- YOU NEED TO CALM HER DOWN.

31:15.569 --> 31:19.660
THAT'’S A BULLET HOLE.
VENT THE MESS HALL. DO IT NOW.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.580
NICE TRY.
TAKE OFF THE MASK.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.016
KAYLEE, PUSH
THE DAMN BUTTON.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.758
WHERE ARE THE BODIES?
TELL US NOW.

31:35.502 --> 31:36.503
UH!

31:41.595 --> 31:42.726
NO!

31:42.770 --> 31:44.903
- SEE?
- NO.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.557
- ONE'’S ALIVE.
- NO.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.733
- HAPPINESS?
- NO.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.172
GO TO HER.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.961
- NO.
- UH! AH!

32:02.964 --> 32:07.273
THE BODIES--
YOU MUST--

32:07.316 --> 32:09.928
I KNOW.

32:09.971 --> 32:13.496
I'’LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.290
I HAVE QUESTIONS.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.988
GET IN LINE, KID.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.513
I WASN'’T
TALKING TO YOU.

32:30.557 --> 32:34.735
FIRST, TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TO CLARKE.

32:37.651 --> 32:41.655
BELLAMY: MURPHY!
MURPHY!

32:41.698 --> 32:44.788
THIS ISN'’T THE RING.

32:44.832 --> 32:48.270
WE'’RE NOT PLAYING GAMES
DOWN HERE,

32:48.314 --> 32:52.013
AND I'’M NOT GONNA LET YOU
HURT ANYONE ELSE.

32:52.057 --> 32:55.016
ABBY'’S VOICE: CLARKE?

32:55.060 --> 32:57.540
CLARKE, WHERE'’D YOU GO?

32:57.584 --> 32:59.629
MURPHY: WAS GONNA SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.501
YOU'’RE THE ONE
WITH THE GUN.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.111
THAT'’S TRUE.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.331
WHAT DO YOU SAY I PUT IT
DOWN AND WE TALK, OK...

33:10.249 --> 33:13.121
YOU AND ME,
JUST A COUPLE GUYS

33:13.165 --> 33:15.689
STUCK ON A MOON,
NOBODY ELSE ON IT,

33:15.732 --> 33:17.560
FILLED WITH MAN-EATING
BUGS AND TOXIC PLANTS

33:17.604 --> 33:18.997
THAT TURN PEOPLE
WHO LOVE EACH OTHER

33:19.040 --> 33:21.564
INTO HOMICIDAL MANIACS.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.871
THAT'’S WHAT'S HAPPENING,
TO YOU, BELLAMY.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.569
OH, SO YOU'’RE
LOOKING OUT FOR ME--

33:26.613 --> 33:30.051
JOHN MURPHY,
COURT JESTER.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.662
WELL,
IT BEATS USELESS.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.926
NOT BY MUCH.

33:37.711 --> 33:38.668
NOW!

33:38.712 --> 33:40.583
UH! UH!

33:40.627 --> 33:44.022
CLARKE! DO IT!

33:44.065 --> 33:46.154
ABBY'’S VOICE:
YOU'’RE A CANCER, CLARKE,

33:46.198 --> 33:48.504
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE DO TO CANCER.

33:48.548 --> 33:51.855
CUT IT OUT.

33:58.906 --> 34:02.518
ABBY'’S VOICE: YOU WANT TO DO
BETTER HERE, BUT YOU CAN'’T.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.870
UH!

34:06.914 --> 34:08.394
YAAH!

34:08.437 --> 34:10.396
AAH!

34:15.009 --> 34:17.577
I WILL KEEP US SAFE.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.100
ABBY'’S VOICE:
NOW KILL YOURSELF.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.884
PUT US OUT
OF OUR MISERY.

34:20.928 --> 34:24.932
RRGH! SAFE! RRGH!

34:24.975 --> 34:27.456
ABBY'’S VOICE: FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.415
CLARKE: IT'’S NOT REAL.
IT'’S NOT.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.939
- UHH!

34:31.982 --> 34:34.637
- YAH!
- AGH! AGH!

34:34.681 --> 34:36.596
ABBY'’S VOICE: FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED, CLARKE.

34:36.639 --> 34:40.121
- I WILL KEEP US...
- DO IT. DO IT.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.731
- SAFE.
- SHUT UP.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.603
- DO IT.
- UGH! RRGH!

34:43.646 --> 34:44.952
SHUT UP!

34:44.995 --> 34:47.085
UHH! SAFE!

34:47.128 --> 34:48.999
- DO IT!
- SHUT UP!

34:49.043 --> 34:51.959
- RRGH!
- SHUT UP!

34:52.002 --> 34:55.093
SHUT UP!

34:56.964 --> 34:58.966
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.277
WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:06.974 --> 35:09.019
BELLAMY: HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU TRIED

35:09.063 --> 35:12.110
TO KILL ME NOW?

35:12.153 --> 35:13.763
- RRGH!
- UH! UH!

35:13.807 --> 35:16.331
- AARGH!
- MURPHY!

35:16.375 --> 35:18.942
BELLAMY:
I'’LL KILL YOU! RRGH...

35:18.986 --> 35:22.163
MURPHY. UH!

35:22.207 --> 35:23.686
RRGH!

35:34.088 --> 35:35.829
BELLAMY: NOT THIS TIME.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.962
THIS TIME, YOU DIE,
NOT ME.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.967
HEY, GET OFF.

35:44.011 --> 35:47.797
BELLAMY: RRGH!

35:47.841 --> 35:50.974
AH! UH!

35:51.018 --> 35:53.629
UH! RAAGH!

35:53.673 --> 35:55.283
GIVE ME THAT THING.
STOP IT, MAN.

35:55.327 --> 35:56.893
- YOU'’RE KILLING HER.
- NO!

35:56.937 --> 36:00.158
I'’M SAVING US
FROM BOTH OF YOU!

36:00.201 --> 36:02.203
YAAGH! AGH! I--

36:02.247 --> 36:06.773
UH! RRGH! UGH! UHH!

36:28.360 --> 36:30.231
RAVEN: ACCORDING TO
THE FLIGHT RECORDER,

36:30.275 --> 36:32.320
THIS IS CLOSE TO
WHERE THEY LANDED.

36:32.364 --> 36:35.193
SPREAD OUT.
FIND THEIR TRAIL.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.107
BRING HER OUT.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.109
KAYLEE: I TOLD YOU, I'’M NOT
GOING WITHOUT MY FAMILY.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.546
THEY'’RE NOT SAFE HERE.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.025
NEWS FLASH--
THEY'’RE ALREADY DEAD.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.679
RAVEN: HEY, THE
ECLIPSE IS OVER.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.855
YOU SAID IF WE
HEARD INSECTS,

36:45.899 --> 36:48.771
THE TOXIN'’S GONE, SO
WHAT AREN'’T YOU TELLING US?

36:48.815 --> 36:51.557
SHE'’S NOT TELLING
US ANYTHING.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.342
ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

36:54.386 --> 36:57.084
OCTAVIA: JUST PULL THE TRIGGER
AND LET'’S MOVE.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.565
- YOU STOWED AWAY?
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

36:59.608 --> 37:03.090
SAVING MY BROTHER.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.575
THEY WENT THIS WAY.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.276
WE DO NEED A TRACKER.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.757
ABBY:
WAIT. NO WAY. NO.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.107
IT WAS DANGEROUS ENOUGH
WITHOUT BLODREINA.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.805
ABBY'’S RIGHT, HEDA.
YOU'’RE TOO IMPORTANT.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.372
WE CAN BEGIN
YOUR TRAINING.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.374
GREAT. I'’M SO
GLAD I WOKE YOU.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.071
ABBY: DIYOZA'’S
STAYING WITH YOU,

37:28.115 --> 37:30.248
THAT IS, IF YOU WANT ME
TO DELIVER THAT BABY.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.601
I SHOULD STAY WITH
THE SHIP, ANYWAY.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.733
WE GET JACKED AGAIN,
WE'’RE SCREWED.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.258
WE'’LL BE BACK SOON.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.956
RAVEN: LET'’S GO.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.088
THE BODIES WILL BE HERE
WHEN WE GET BACK.

37:45.132 --> 37:48.004
NOW WALK...

37:48.048 --> 37:51.225
PLEASE.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.844
JORDAN: SO WHERE
ARE ALL THESE BUGS

38:01.888 --> 38:03.324
YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT?

38:03.368 --> 38:06.327
DEAD, CONSUMED
BY THE TREES BY NOW.

38:06.371 --> 38:09.025
THAT'’S HOW YOU'LL
FIND YOUR PEOPLE, TOO.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.162
OCTAVIA: THEY WERE HERE.

38:18.165 --> 38:19.775
STOP!

38:21.647 --> 38:23.431
IT'’S A RADIATION
SHIELD.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.042
YOUR PEOPLE COULDN'’T
PASS THROUGH.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.262
YOU'’LL FIND THEIR
BODIES ON THIS SIDE OF--

38:32.092 --> 38:34.224
WHAT?

38:34.268 --> 38:36.531
GET BACK HERE. D'’UGH!

38:44.191 --> 38:46.889
WHO'’S SHAW?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.326
- NO.
- LET ME GO.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.893
- NO, RAVEN.
- GET OFF ME. LET ME GO.

39:02.731 --> 39:05.255
SAFE NOW.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.035
JORDAN: WHAT'’S WRONG?
WHY AREN'’T THEY MOVING?

39:46.079 --> 39:48.908
ABBY: CLARKE--
THEY'’RE ALIVE.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.043
ABBY: HONEY, WAKE UP.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.002
- MOM?
- I'’M HERE.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.137
JORDAN: WHERE
ARE THE OTHERS?

40:01.181 --> 40:03.401
CLARKE: LOCKED UP
TO PROTECT US.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.751
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SHAW?

40:05.794 --> 40:08.275
BELLAMY: ABBY?

40:08.318 --> 40:11.409
UGH...

40:16.283 --> 40:19.808
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING HERE...

40:21.331 --> 40:23.899
AND WHO IS THAT?

40:23.943 --> 40:26.424
ABBY: JOHN, WAKE UP.
COME ON NOW.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.475
HIS PULSE IS TOO WEAK.

40:34.519 --> 40:38.174
CLARKE:
MOM, WHAT IS THIS?

40:38.218 --> 40:41.003
I DON'’T KNOW.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.323
COME ON.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.989
HA HA HA!

41:19.433 --> 41:20.869
WHAT?

41:33.403 --> 41:36.494
IT'’S OK, ROSE.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.887
DON'’T BE AFRAID.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.766
ARE YOU HERE
TO TAKE US HOME?

41:56.209 --> 41:59.081
ISN'’T THIS YOUR HOME?
