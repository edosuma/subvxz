00:23.832 --> 00:25.980
Who the hell are you?

00:26.842 --> 00:30.022
It's not who so much as what.
This is a men's room.

00:30.022 --> 00:31.473
What's your name, fella?

00:31.473 --> 00:34.641
I'm Shirley Schmidt.
Pardon the intrusion but…

00:34.641 --> 00:37.459
one of our assistants
is suing us under title IX,

00:37.459 --> 00:40.332
claiming, among other things,
the men have better fixtures.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.806
So you're Shirley Schmidt
of Crane, Poole &…

00:43.806 --> 00:45.492
Schmidt.

00:45.492 --> 00:47.963
Alan Shore. It's a pleasure.

00:48.956 --> 00:52.557
Surely you intend 
to wash that first.

00:53.003 --> 00:56.759
I keep an extremely clean penis.

00:58.989 --> 01:01.186
–I know all about you.
–And I you.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.769
There's much 
written in stall number 2.

01:03.769 --> 01:06.174
I pictured you younger. Much.

01:06.174 --> 01:10.235
A smart attorney recognizes
who he can or cannot rattle.

01:10.235 --> 01:13.777
He also knows a good rattle
when he sees one.

01:14.349 --> 01:17.832
Since I'm your boss,
I can't return your sexual banter,

01:17.832 --> 01:21.930
but I will say, for the record,
that if I were looking for a rattle,

01:21.930 --> 01:24.355
he would be taller,
he would be better-looking.

01:24.355 --> 01:27.494
He would be more evolved
than a junior in high school.

01:27.494 --> 01:29.384
I prefer the juniors in high school.

01:29.384 --> 01:33.380
He would be something other than 
a self-loathing narcissist with a dwarf fetish,

01:33.380 --> 01:36.082
and, yes, judging from what
I got a glimpse of in the mirror

01:36.082 --> 01:41.391
when I first entered the room,
he would be bigger.

01:42.171 --> 01:44.701
Much.

01:49.819 --> 01:51.762
My, my, my.

01:52.186 --> 01:55.294
Boston Legal
1x11. Schmidt Happens

02:20.189 --> 02:22.182
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2005/01/09

02:22.182 --> 02:24.310
She's been in the New York
office the last three years.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.897
Rumor has it Lewiston called 
her back to get things into shape.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.158
What things?

02:28.158 --> 02:30.793
Us things. Litigation has been 
underperforming, Sally.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.632
Plus, our image around town
is becoming that of…

02:32.632 --> 02:34.325
–Denny Crane.
–Exactly.

02:34.325 --> 02:37.378
The truth is, we need a kick 
in the ass, and I'm glad she's back.

02:37.378 --> 02:39.523
–Uh, Lori…
–Is Shirley Schmidt really back?

02:39.523 --> 02:42.925
Temporarily. I need you in the conference 
room on another matter. It's urgent.

02:42.925 --> 02:45.565
–I'm available.
–As soon as you can, please.

02:51.607 --> 02:52.920
Why is she back?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.863
Evidently, Lewiston 
asked her to return.

02:54.863 --> 02:56.828
–Why?
–This I do not know.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.822
I do not want Shirley Schmidt
in this building.

02:59.822 --> 03:03.909
Denny, she's a named partner.
You can't exactly ban her presence.

03:04.775 --> 03:08.660
I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told anybody.

03:09.005 --> 03:13.250
I once had a torrid…

03:13.250 --> 03:15.429
torrid affair with that woman.

03:15.429 --> 03:19.629
–First, everybody knows that…
–and second, the word would be “horrid.”

03:20.325 --> 03:22.642
Shirley.

03:23.239 --> 03:26.746
This firm isn't big enough
for the two of us.

03:26.746 --> 03:30.877
I agree. It would be best if we 
could be in different cities but…

03:30.877 --> 03:33.794
it's our differences, ironically,
that call for me to be here now.

03:33.794 --> 03:36.213
What differences, specifically?

03:36.213 --> 03:40.074
Well, for starters,
I still know how to practice law.

03:40.074 --> 03:44.651
I don't have to go around saying my 
name out loud in order to remember it.

03:44.651 --> 03:47.208
I don't want you here.

03:47.208 --> 03:51.312
Is it because…

03:51.312 --> 03:53.150
you still desire me?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.439
Ha.

03:54.439 --> 03:56.662
I'm over my wrinkle fetish.

03:56.662 --> 03:59.587
–You don't arouse me, Shirley.
–Oh, please,

03:59.587 --> 04:05.285
all I have to do is say those 
two combustible little words.

04:06.969 --> 04:09.968
Denny Crane.

04:21.154 --> 04:23.517
She's still hot.

04:33.828 --> 04:36.670
Alan, there's a guy on the phone.
He isn't a client.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.202
He picked us
out of the yellow pages.

04:38.202 --> 04:40.873
He said he's committed a crime,
and he needs to speak to a lawyer.

04:40.873 --> 04:43.107
We advertise in the yellow pages?

04:43.107 --> 04:45.081
He sounded really upset.

04:45.081 --> 04:47.393
What should I do?

04:53.769 --> 04:56.125
–Line four?
–Yes.

04:59.529 --> 05:00.856
This is Alan Shore.

05:00.856 --> 05:02.689
If you're a criminal, 
please state your name

05:02.689 --> 05:05.821
and the nature of your crime
at the sound of the tone.

05:05.821 --> 05:07.866
<i>I killed my mother.</i>

05:07.866 --> 05:08.951
Sir, excuse me?

05:08.951 --> 05:12.377
<i>This is a lawyer, right?
What, what I say is privileged, right?</i>

05:12.377 --> 05:14.329
It might have been wise
to establish that before

05:14.329 --> 05:17.207
telling me you killed mother,
but, yes, we'll call this privileged.

05:17.207 --> 05:20.103
<i>It was an accident.
Now I don't know what to do.</i>

05:20.103 --> 05:21.524
Okay,

05:21.524 --> 05:23.409
where is mother now?

05:23.409 --> 05:25.989
<i>On the kitchen floor.</i>

05:26.622 --> 05:27.995
Okay.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.291
And have you called
for an ambulance, or…

05:30.291 --> 05:34.186
<i>She's dead. I don't wanna call the police.
They'd arrest me, wouldn't they?</i>

05:34.186 --> 05:36.141
Typically.

05:36.141 --> 05:39.704
Why don't you give me
your name and address, sir?

05:42.563 --> 05:43.822
Ah, here she is.

05:43.822 --> 05:45.518
John, this is Lori Colson.

05:45.518 --> 05:48.349
Lori, John Zenawi,
CEO of Hanley tech.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.804
–Very nice to meet you.
–My pleasure.

05:50.804 --> 05:52.300
Please sit.

05:53.232 --> 05:56.401
John is a long time client
of our corporate department.

05:56.401 --> 05:59.397
Yes, I think I've done some anti-trust
work for your company on occasion.

05:59.397 --> 06:01.938
He's here today because…

06:02.374 --> 06:05.401
John, would you like to explain?

06:05.879 --> 06:07.644
I was born in Sudan.

06:07.644 --> 06:10.477
My father transferred
to the States when I was 5.

06:10.477 --> 06:11.906
I've lived here since.

06:11.906 --> 06:15.685
Most of my extended family
remains in Sudan.

06:15.685 --> 06:19.033
One of my cousins was 
murdered there last week.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.091
I'm very sorry.

06:21.091 --> 06:24.616
That was the 11th family member
to have been killed.

06:24.616 --> 06:31.014
I can't begin to describe
the sense of futility I feel.

06:31.344 --> 06:33.758
I need to do something, Ms Colson.

06:33.758 --> 06:36.041
I've been fortunate
to have made a lot of money,

06:36.041 --> 06:39.198
and I can no longer sit passively.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.099
So, as preposterous as it may sound,

06:42.099 --> 06:45.061
and as expensive as it may be,

06:45.061 --> 06:46.889
I want to sue the government.

06:46.889 --> 06:50.147
Well, our courts wouldn't have jurisdiction
over the Sudanese government.

06:50.147 --> 06:51.886
I'm sure Paul told you that.

06:51.886 --> 06:54.568
He's not looking to sue
the Sudanese government.

06:54.568 --> 06:57.987
I want to go after the United States.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.168
On what grounds?

07:00.168 --> 07:02.279
That is what I need you to tell me.

07:02.279 --> 07:05.303
Typically, Lori, whenever
there's a case that can't be brought,

07:05.303 --> 07:06.859
I run it by you.

07:06.859 --> 07:11.266
You call me insane among other things
more colorful, you exit the room,

07:11.266 --> 07:13.745
then return the next day
with a crazy idea.

07:13.745 --> 07:16.449
We need that idea, Lori.

07:16.449 --> 07:19.632
If I can get into court, Ms Colson,
I can make some noise.

07:19.632 --> 07:21.779
That is what I'm 
desperate to do here,

07:21.779 --> 07:23.594
put this issue in the 
spotlight a little,

07:23.594 --> 07:26.925
create maybe an outcry of sorts.

07:27.274 --> 07:29.544
I don't mean to sound harsh,

07:29.544 --> 07:31.635
but the genocide 
going on in Sudan

07:31.635 --> 07:35.855
has been covered quite 
a bit by the press, Mr Zenawi,

07:36.063 --> 07:39.582
and the American 
people have spoken.

07:39.829 --> 07:43.169
They don't care.

07:45.684 --> 07:47.475
Well,

07:47.475 --> 07:53.016
I guess, for my own peace of mind,

07:53.813 --> 07:56.823
I need to do whatever I can.

08:02.687 --> 08:03.970
Maddie.

08:03.970 --> 08:05.791
Yes. –Hello, dear, 
I'm Shirley Schmidt.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.563
I read your title IX 
complaint last night.

08:07.563 --> 08:10.723
It's very well drafted. You obviously
hired an excellent attorney.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.435
You're fired, Maddie.

08:12.435 --> 08:13.962
You can't…

08:13.962 --> 08:16.506
you can't fire me
for bringing a title IX.

08:16.506 --> 08:17.942
What are you going to do,
sweetheart, sue me?

08:17.942 --> 08:19.245
You've already done that.

08:19.245 --> 08:23.078
Call your persuasive lawyer, tell him 
to add a count for wrongful termination.

08:23.078 --> 08:24.455
Bye-bye.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.899
By now I'm sure you've 
run to Paul Lewiston.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.090
No.

08:30.090 --> 08:33.100
I'm coming directly to you because 
I don't care what Paul Lewiston wants.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.292
I'm Denny Crane.

08:34.292 --> 08:35.692
Crane comes before Schmidt.

08:35.692 --> 08:37.875
You refer, of course, to 
when we were intimate.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.505
Shirley, I demand 
to know your agenda.

08:39.505 --> 08:41.494
You always have one, so please…

08:41.494 --> 08:44.868
I told you my agenda, Denny.
It's to fix things.

08:44.868 --> 08:46.452
Excuse me,

08:46.452 --> 08:47.701
what's your name?

08:47.701 --> 08:50.006
–Sally Heep.
–Very nice outfit, Sally.

08:50.006 --> 08:51.368
Can you spell?

08:51.368 --> 08:53.722
Wear something more appropriate.
Pretend you're a lawyer.

08:53.722 --> 08:56.588
This woman happens to be
an excellent attorney.

08:56.588 --> 08:59.286
She also happens 
to have a name.

08:59.286 --> 09:01.250
What is it?

09:04.706 --> 09:07.632
Time's up. Bye-bye.

09:08.142 --> 09:11.042
Denny Crane.

09:25.163 --> 09:27.091
Could you please state your name?

09:27.091 --> 09:29.421
Alan Shore.

09:30.994 --> 09:33.293
Mr Shore,
thank you for coming.

09:33.293 --> 09:36.244
I didn't know what to do, or…

09:36.244 --> 09:38.050
this is a horrible thing.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.846
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.498
Where are my manners?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.111
May I offer you 
something to drink?

09:44.111 --> 09:46.332
Maybe we should 
start with the kitchen.

09:46.332 --> 09:49.135
Yes, okay, um,

09:49.135 --> 09:52.329
I apologize in advance for…

09:52.329 --> 09:53.786
you know…

09:53.786 --> 09:56.414
–the mess.
–I didn't mean for this to happen.

09:56.414 --> 09:59.381
I don't know what to do.

10:00.731 --> 10:02.943
See?

10:03.049 --> 10:05.105
I told you.

10:10.782 --> 10:13.636
Mr Ferrion, you really do
need to call the police.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.992
First, I need to know my options.

10:15.992 --> 10:17.298
Besides Brazil?

10:17.298 --> 10:21.777
Well, sometimes, there's circumstances
that excuse or, or justify.

10:21.777 --> 10:26.142
I, I really need to know
what's available to me.

10:26.814 --> 10:30.478
Could you first tell me how she came 
to be lying dead on the floor?

10:30.478 --> 10:32.883
I hit her on the head with a skillet.

10:32.883 --> 10:33.838
Cast iron.

10:33.838 --> 10:37.429
But it wasn't 
premeditated or planned.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.372
It was just…

10:39.372 --> 10:40.646
one of those things.

10:40.646 --> 10:44.411
She was berating me
like she does all the time…

10:44.411 --> 10:47.662
how I don't make enough money,
how I'm weak.

10:47.662 --> 10:52.045
All the time, the same litany
of how I am a failure.

10:52.045 --> 10:55.158
It makes me so enraged.

10:55.158 --> 10:57.737
It sounds like an accidental
skillet bopping so far.

10:57.737 --> 10:59.687
She kept on and on,

10:59.687 --> 11:03.538
and I kept squeezing it tighter and 
tighter without even realizing it.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.678
And then, I swung.

11:05.678 --> 11:07.814
But I swear, Mr Shore,
I never decided to.

11:07.814 --> 11:09.499
Suddenly, my arm was in motion.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.508
Bam! I hit her,
and she went down.

11:11.508 --> 11:13.831
What do I do?

11:16.097 --> 11:19.134
I certainly can't advise you 
to conceal evidence in any way,

11:19.134 --> 11:21.750
but I'm afraid you're going to
have to call the police, Mr Ferrion.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.630
And if you don't, I'll have to.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.343
–But you're my lawyer.
–I understand, but…

11:25.343 --> 11:27.080
What am I gonna tell them?

11:29.721 --> 11:31.255
I thought you said she was dead.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.634
She is. I checked her pulse.

11:39.231 --> 11:44.752
Sometimes the air remaining
inside the body escapes,

11:44.897 --> 11:47.309
causing…

12:03.574 --> 12:05.894
You need not call
the police, Mr Ferrion.

12:05.894 --> 12:07.642
Call for an ambulance.

12:07.642 --> 12:10.114
Mother is still alive.

12:12.637 --> 12:15.007
Would you like to hit her again?

12:23.738 --> 12:27.196
Did I witness any of it?

12:27.196 --> 12:28.612
Mr Zenawi,

12:28.612 --> 12:30.863
before I can figure out if 
there is a claim,

12:30.863 --> 12:33.511
I first need to satisfy standing.

12:33.511 --> 12:37.328
It would certainly help if we could 
make out a case for you specifically.

12:37.328 --> 12:39.625
Legally, we have a term
called zone of danger.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.031
Basically, if you were
in harm's way yourself.

12:42.031 --> 12:45.288
That's why I asked if you've
ever witnessed any of it.

12:45.288 --> 12:47.645
I heard it once.

12:47.956 --> 12:49.082
You heard it?

12:49.082 --> 12:51.623
This past Summer, 
I was with relatives.

12:51.623 --> 12:55.079
We were celebrating
one of my uncles' birthdays.

12:55.616 --> 12:58.468
The army showed up, and, um,

12:58.468 --> 13:00.705
they, um…

13:00.705 --> 13:03.014
they accosted us.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.411
Accosted you by…

13:07.411 --> 13:08.930
They told us we were slaves,

13:08.930 --> 13:12.991
that we had no right to be 
in the country, that, um,

13:12.991 --> 13:17.070
we were occupying grazing 
land for their cattle.

13:17.238 --> 13:19.170
My uncle protested.

13:19.170 --> 13:22.343
They took him behind 
a barn structure…

13:24.844 --> 13:27.877
and set him on fire.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.772
We all heard the screams.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.016
And then they raped 
one of my cousins.

13:44.739 --> 13:48.098
Does that set out a case for me…

13:48.247 --> 13:51.816
specifically…

13:55.009 --> 13:57.683
to listen to your, uh,

13:58.220 --> 14:01.614
uncle being burned to death,

14:01.614 --> 14:05.091
your cousin being raped?

14:12.298 --> 14:14.731
It's not that I am not relieved.

14:14.731 --> 14:15.877
I am.

14:15.877 --> 14:18.684
I certainly do love her,
but what if she tells?

14:18.684 --> 14:20.797
Perhaps you should have used
a bigger frying pan.

14:20.797 --> 14:22.699
Mr Ferrion,

14:22.699 --> 14:23.933
did you see what happened?

14:23.933 --> 14:27.035
No, um, she was on a stool
putting some things away.

14:27.035 --> 14:29.066
I went upstairs to have a bath.

14:29.066 --> 14:31.032
I heard a crash, 
I came running back,

14:31.032 --> 14:34.284
and she is on the
floor unconscious.

14:34.284 --> 14:36.578
–And you are?
–This is Alan Shore.

14:36.578 --> 14:39.438
He's a friend of the family.

14:41.691 --> 14:44.188
Bernie, you surprise me.

14:45.173 --> 14:46.450
Is she gonna be okay?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.989
We don't know, sir.

14:59.388 --> 15:01.337
I have a crazy idea.

15:01.337 --> 15:02.917
Already?

15:02.917 --> 15:05.648
In tort law, you see a guy lying
on the side of the street,

15:05.648 --> 15:08.137
you have no obligation
to pull over and help.

15:08.137 --> 15:12.647
But if you do pull over, you incur 
a duty to complete that rescue.

15:12.647 --> 15:15.151
The theory being other 
would-be rescuers pass by,

15:15.151 --> 15:17.981
thinking help is
already on the scene.

15:18.463 --> 15:20.174
And?

15:20.703 --> 15:23.529
The United States has
declared a war on terrorism.

15:23.529 --> 15:25.562
We've talked the talk
when it comes to Sudan,

15:25.562 --> 15:27.443
we've even given financial aid.

15:27.443 --> 15:29.242
Our theory of law 
would be analogous.

15:29.242 --> 15:30.766
Other countries have stayed out,

15:30.766 --> 15:33.757
thinking America's stepping in
when we're not.

15:34.484 --> 15:36.170
It's not a winner.

15:36.170 --> 15:39.881
But perhaps colorable enough
to sue and make noise.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.115
Go draft the complaint.

15:44.461 --> 15:46.950
And?

15:48.543 --> 15:50.641
Thank you.

15:57.815 --> 16:02.424
Lori Colson, you slut.

16:02.424 --> 16:03.890
How are you, Shirley?

16:03.890 --> 16:05.936
Old. Rich.

16:05.936 --> 16:08.013
You look great.

16:08.153 --> 16:09.531
So, who are we sleeping with?

16:09.531 --> 16:11.137
Oh, usual suspects.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.508
You back for good?

16:12.508 --> 16:14.105
Just for bad.

16:14.105 --> 16:16.813
Wanna grab a beer later
and do a little debriefing?

16:16.813 --> 16:18.360
Love it.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.423
You look awesome, by the way.

16:20.423 --> 16:22.377
I know.

16:22.911 --> 16:24.801
I certainly don't mind
him talking to you.

16:24.801 --> 16:25.909
Look, he already has.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.097
But if I let him take a polygraph?

16:27.097 --> 16:29.629
Come on, I could be 
sued for malpractice.

16:29.629 --> 16:32.198
How is it exactly you came 
to be here, Mr Shore?

16:32.198 --> 16:34.231
I drove.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.269
Bernie's a friend,
I'm here as his friend.

16:37.269 --> 16:39.189
And since I am a lawyer, 
look, come on,

16:39.189 --> 16:41.364
there's no sign of a struggle.

16:41.364 --> 16:42.632
She slipped and fell,

16:42.632 --> 16:46.975
and hit her head on either 
the table or counter or stool, floor.

16:46.975 --> 16:48.753
Your experts will figure it out.

16:48.753 --> 16:51.824
He'd like to go to the hospital
to be with his mother.

16:51.824 --> 16:54.114
Can I tell him he can do that?

16:58.233 --> 17:00.573
Tell him not to leave the jurisdiction.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.867
I heard some of that.
Do they suspect me?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.291
It's crossed their minds.

17:17.587 --> 17:19.523
Well, you should know that

17:19.523 --> 17:21.669
if you're gonna pass yourself
off as my friend…

17:21.669 --> 17:23.101
You did that, Bernie.

17:23.101 --> 17:26.127
You should know that 
my friends call me Bernard.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.773
Ah, so I guess that would 
make me your special friend.

17:29.773 --> 17:31.777
Tell me, Bernie,

17:31.777 --> 17:34.657
what exactly became of the skillet?

17:46.912 --> 17:49.816
You weren't expecting them
to throw a parade for you, were you?

17:49.816 --> 17:52.145
No, but if I get too much resistance,

17:52.145 --> 17:55.815
I assume I'm permitted to bring
my big broom out of the closet.

17:55.815 --> 17:58.852
Is that how you get around,
on your big broom?

17:58.852 --> 18:01.674
Shirley, this is Alan Shore.

18:01.674 --> 18:04.868
We've met. –Yes, Shirley was 
in the men's room earlier.

18:04.868 --> 18:06.532
Inspecting his fixtures.

18:06.532 --> 18:08.721
I'm a micromanager.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.683
Mr Shore?

18:11.983 --> 18:13.408
I thought you were 
going to the hospital.

18:13.408 --> 18:17.065
I did. We have a little problem.

18:18.622 --> 18:20.280
Excuse me, I have a client.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.097
Maybe we can 
catch up later, Shirley.

18:22.097 --> 18:25.297
Good. You can tell me 
about your products.

18:28.819 --> 18:31.400
An excellent lawyer.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.238
If I determine he should go…

18:33.238 --> 18:34.906
he goes.

18:37.521 --> 18:40.071
She's vegetative.

18:40.189 --> 18:43.914
The doctors think it's 50/50
if she'll come out of it.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.527
In the meantime, and, uh,

18:47.527 --> 18:50.491
I say this with a heavy heart.

18:50.491 --> 18:51.784
Of course.

18:51.784 --> 18:58.314
My mother used to be
a Christian scientist, as did I.

18:58.314 --> 19:00.543
She hasn't been one for years.

19:00.543 --> 19:01.941
But I…

19:01.941 --> 19:09.436
I let it slip out to the doctors that she 
recently rededicated herself to the faith.

19:09.436 --> 19:12.597
And they've made inquiries

19:12.597 --> 19:15.939
as to her position 
on medical treatment.

19:15.939 --> 19:20.248
I really don't think she 
would want to be on a respirator,

19:20.248 --> 19:23.773
as much as it pains me to admit.

19:23.773 --> 19:29.338
You let it slip out that your mother is
a born-again Christian scientist?

19:29.338 --> 19:33.806
May I ask, did your mother 
rededicate herself to Christian science

19:33.806 --> 19:38.024
before or after you hit her 
on the head with the skillet?

19:38.024 --> 19:39.606
I don't appreciate that question.

19:39.606 --> 19:41.706
What are you asking me for, Bernie?

19:42.664 --> 19:46.684
Again, as much as it pains me,

19:47.346 --> 19:51.030
I'd like you to safeguard
her religious freedom.

19:58.969 --> 20:02.021
We filed last night. U.S. Attorney's 
office didn't waste any time.

20:02.021 --> 20:04.486
–They brought a 12-B-6.
–Sovereign immunity.

20:04.486 --> 20:06.215
Mm-hmm, this may be
our one day in court.

20:06.215 --> 20:07.895
And therefore, our one 
day to make noise.

20:07.895 --> 20:10.345
We've put out a release.
There should be media in the room.

20:10.345 --> 20:12.433
Can you join for the motion?
I'd like to make a big showing.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.914
Should we get Denny?

20:13.914 --> 20:15.112
Maybe not that big.

20:15.112 --> 20:17.352
It'll help to have him at the table.

20:17.352 --> 20:19.928
Shirley, I want you 
to think back and tell me

20:19.928 --> 20:23.848
who is the best attorney
you have ever seen in court.

20:24.642 --> 20:26.316
Me.

20:26.316 --> 20:30.444
We need to survive a 12-B-6
on a pretty untenable claim.

20:30.444 --> 20:33.605
How would you feel about
joining us for oral arguments?

20:33.605 --> 20:34.759
What's the claim?

20:34.759 --> 20:36.852
We're suing 
the United States government

20:36.852 --> 20:39.722
for the genocide that's 
taking place in Sudan.

20:39.722 --> 20:41.849
What's so untenable about that?

20:41.849 --> 20:44.031
And this is why I love her.

20:44.539 --> 20:48.259
Alan, we're making a show 
of force in a high-profile matter.

20:48.259 --> 20:50.924
Could we trouble you to join 
us for a motion this morning?

20:50.924 --> 20:52.286
I'd love to.

20:52.286 --> 20:55.093
But, see, I have a client who hit his 
mother on the head with a skillet.

20:55.093 --> 20:56.580
We're trying to take her
off life support.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.856
And the police have brought
some nuisance action to try

20:58.856 --> 21:00.247
to keep her breathing,
buggers that they are.

21:00.247 --> 21:05.570
By the way, my fixtures remain 
available for further inspection.

21:08.144 --> 21:10.359
Paul.

21:15.786 --> 21:17.295
He's funny.

21:22.895 --> 21:26.990
Denny, may we borrow your 
prowess for a motion this morning?

21:26.990 --> 21:29.232
Why did you bring 
Shirley Schmidt back here?

21:29.232 --> 21:30.654
Because we need her.

21:30.654 --> 21:33.070
Well, then, 
go borrow her prowess.

21:33.522 --> 21:35.092
It was a betrayal.

21:35.092 --> 21:38.574
Calling her back here
says I'm not enough.

21:38.574 --> 21:40.781
Can you get that?

21:40.935 --> 21:42.510
I can.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.536
Then why did you do it?

21:45.695 --> 21:48.371
You're not enough.

21:48.536 --> 21:51.284
I still matter, my friend.

21:51.876 --> 21:53.409
Yes, you do,

21:53.409 --> 21:56.915
which is why I asked you
to be present for this motion.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.497
There's another problem
you don't even know about.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.794
Which is?

22:02.115 --> 22:04.336
That woman…

22:04.336 --> 22:06.596
she's hot for me.

22:12.779 --> 22:15.589
Certainly there's a state interest
in preserving life, your honor.

22:15.589 --> 22:18.440
If a patient wishes to refuse medical 
treatment based on religious practices…

22:18.440 --> 22:20.585
–First of all, we don't know that.
–Objection, your honor.

22:20.585 --> 22:23.331
You can't preface your second
point with “first of all.”

22:23.331 --> 22:25.665
This woman has forsaken 
Christian science.

22:25.665 --> 22:27.539
–We have no assurance…
–According to her son,

22:27.539 --> 22:29.902
–she's recommitted herself…
–A son who might be a suspect

22:29.902 --> 22:33.474
if we determine there was foul play.
We're dealing with a potential homicide.

22:33.474 --> 22:37.511
Well, if the goal is to charge homicide, 
it makes little sense to keep the victim alive.

22:37.511 --> 22:40.051
–I could be wrong.
–I object to this smugness, your honor.

22:40.051 --> 22:41.813
A human life is at stake here.

22:41.813 --> 22:44.676
The family of Della 
Ferrion is here today

22:44.676 --> 22:48.096
saying it is her wish not 
to be kept alive on a respirator.

22:48.096 --> 22:51.659
And it is simply way too early to 
make that call. She could recover.

22:51.659 --> 22:53.304
–The suggestion that…
–The issue isn't recovery,

22:53.304 --> 22:55.941
it's religious freedom,
which is sacred in this country.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.448
Unless, of course, you're muslim.

22:58.448 --> 23:00.129
I'm gonna have to cut you both off.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.945
We've just received word
from the hospital.

23:01.945 --> 23:06.433
Mrs Ferrion has evidently
regained consciousness.

23:11.222 --> 23:12.872
Excellent.

23:19.669 --> 23:21.967
No comment.
We have no comment at this time.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.550
We'll be making a comment
after the motion.

23:23.550 --> 23:26.013
Denny Crane.
I eat cocoa puffs.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.512
Denny Crane.

23:27.512 --> 23:29.324
Cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.104
Denny Crane…

23:31.718 --> 23:35.065
They're seeking damages for acts 
committed by a foreign government

23:35.065 --> 23:37.038
against a foreign citizenry.

23:37.038 --> 23:39.260
There's no jurisdiction here, 
no standing.

23:39.260 --> 23:40.741
And even if there were,

23:40.741 --> 23:43.656
any such lawsuit would be barred
by sovereign immunity,

23:43.656 --> 23:46.228
which prohibits the U.S. Government
or its officials

23:46.228 --> 23:49.518
from being sued for foreign 
policy decisions.

23:49.518 --> 23:51.678
Ms Colson, I have to agree.

23:51.678 --> 23:54.932
How do I not toss this on its face?

23:56.253 --> 23:57.585
First,

23:57.585 --> 23:59.628
the United States government, 
through Congress,

23:59.628 --> 24:02.910
ratified the U.N. 
convention against genocide.

24:02.910 --> 24:05.455
The government's current failure 
to stop the genocide in Sudan

24:05.455 --> 24:07.902
violates both U.S. law and policy.

24:07.902 --> 24:09.399
We have not failed, 
we have expended….

24:09.399 --> 24:13.479
You're arguing the merits,
which I'm happy to do, but it means a trial.

24:13.479 --> 24:15.677
If a government begins
a rescue operation

24:15.677 --> 24:18.706
which, in effect, stops other 
countries from pursuing that rescue,

24:18.706 --> 24:22.094
that government can be held liable
for failing to complete that rescue.

24:22.094 --> 24:27.304
Never! Never has the United States government
attempted any rescue mission in Sudan.

24:27.304 --> 24:29.261
Your honor, may I?

24:31.974 --> 24:34.670
We know this lawsuit
is a bit of a stretch.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.046
–You understate it.
–But the truth is,

24:37.046 --> 24:39.255
our country puts it out there.

24:39.255 --> 24:42.662
“We will root out terrorism
wherever it thrives.”

24:42.662 --> 24:45.001
We elect our presidents 
on that theme.

24:45.001 --> 24:46.475
We go to war over it.

24:46.475 --> 24:50.054
Wherever oppression abounds,
we get involved.

24:50.054 --> 24:52.654
It's almost become a motto.

24:52.843 --> 24:56.693
No one here denies an ethnic 
genocide is taking place in Sudan.

24:56.693 --> 25:00.214
Arab militia are wiping out
the black population of Darfur.

25:00.214 --> 25:02.310
Am I boring you?

25:02.466 --> 25:06.020
Ms Schmidt, the court 
recognizes the atrocity.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.898
Why should the United States
be held liable?

25:08.898 --> 25:12.583
Well, if we're not going 
to do anything about it,

25:12.583 --> 25:14.200
maybe we should just say so.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.068
Lord knows the world will understand.

25:16.068 --> 25:18.689
We've certainly got our hands full.

25:18.689 --> 25:22.530
But when our leaders do
their bipartisan puffing,

25:23.712 --> 25:25.734
other countries think
we're going to do something.

25:25.734 --> 25:28.902
They then stay out of it.
And in the end, nothing gets done.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.538
while millions of people
are being persecuted.

25:32.538 --> 25:35.173
Maybe as a compromise,

25:35.173 --> 25:39.366
we could just get the U.S. government
to declare for the record,

25:39.366 --> 25:42.031
“hey, not our problem.”

25:42.031 --> 25:46.481
That way, the world would be on notice
somebody else should play hero.

25:46.481 --> 25:49.487
I could try to sell that to my client.

25:49.817 --> 25:53.200
Mr Joiner? –The United states 
response to an ethnic genocide is

25:53.200 --> 25:56.228
certainly not gonna be
“hey, not our problem.”

25:57.953 --> 26:01.807
See, this is how other 
countries get confused.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.359
We're satisfied the judge
took it under advisement.

26:05.359 --> 26:07.909
It at least demonstrates
a recognition on her part

26:07.909 --> 26:09.761
that we have 
a colorable cause of action.

26:09.761 --> 26:12.066
Did you understand a word
that was said in there?

26:12.066 --> 26:13.698
Just go with it.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.093
Denny Crane. Trix are for kids.

26:16.093 --> 26:17.292
Glad to meet you.

26:17.292 --> 26:18.563
Did he just say, “trix are for kids?”

26:18.563 --> 26:19.775
He did.

26:21.435 --> 26:24.236
She's very weak, of course, 
and quite sedated.

26:24.236 --> 26:25.809
Can I talk to her?

26:25.809 --> 26:28.411
For a minute or two.
I'd like her to rest.

26:30.764 --> 26:33.311
Mom?

26:34.822 --> 26:37.324
Mom?

26:39.434 --> 26:41.513
It's me.

26:41.513 --> 26:43.830
Bernard.

26:44.457 --> 26:46.755
Bernard.

26:46.755 --> 26:49.661
The doctors say you're 
gonna be just fine.

26:49.661 --> 26:51.325
You just need to rest, mother.

26:51.325 --> 26:54.766
My Bernard.

26:56.372 --> 27:00.235
He hit me on the head.

27:00.414 --> 27:03.284
I think with a skillet.

27:03.935 --> 27:05.775
Ma…

27:05.775 --> 27:08.345
what are you talking about?

27:08.345 --> 27:09.741
You fell.

27:09.741 --> 27:13.424
You tried to kill me.

27:14.503 --> 27:17.053
She's a Chatty Cathy.

27:32.552 --> 27:35.737
If we're going to work together,
we should reach some kind of accord.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.943
I don't wanna be working together.
That's the whole point I'm trying to make.

27:37.943 --> 27:40.791
–Can you tell me why?
–Well, first off, you're a Liberal.

27:40.791 --> 27:43.784
Yes. Besides that?

27:43.784 --> 27:45.709
I figured out what you 
were doing in court today.

27:45.709 --> 27:48.575
–You were Bush-bashing.
–I assure you I wasn't.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.801
You made war comments.

27:50.801 --> 27:53.131
When a Liberal makes
comments about the war,

27:53.131 --> 27:55.742
they're Bush-bashing.
It's un-American.

27:55.742 --> 28:00.149
–To criticize a president?
–While he's in office, yes.

28:00.149 --> 28:02.613
Denny, you and I go way back.

28:02.613 --> 28:04.112
I know you.

28:04.112 --> 28:08.940
Your aversion to my return
has nothing to do with politics.

28:08.940 --> 28:11.541
Can we talk about it?

28:15.801 --> 28:18.599
You left me, Shirley.

28:18.599 --> 28:21.198
Women don't leave Denny Crane.

28:21.198 --> 28:23.869
And for a secretary?

28:24.905 --> 28:27.055
It was the Secretary of Defense.

28:27.055 --> 28:29.349
It doesn't matter.
I have an image.

28:29.349 --> 28:32.799
One could even say I'm,
I'm all image.

28:32.799 --> 28:35.203
One could.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.702
Imagine the fun 
working together again.

28:40.702 --> 28:43.407
It won't be fun.

28:43.934 --> 28:47.392
There's only room 
for one at the mountaintop.

28:50.790 --> 28:53.153
It's my mountain.

28:55.724 --> 28:56.919
Denny…

28:58.610 --> 29:00.432
The judge just called us back.

29:00.432 --> 29:01.513
Already?

29:01.513 --> 29:04.153
Is there any way that 
could be a good sign?

29:04.514 --> 29:08.178
I was hoping to at least survive
till the 6:00 news.

29:14.104 --> 29:15.879
He called the police?

29:15.879 --> 29:18.373
–I'm afraid so.
–What do I do? What do I do?

29:18.373 --> 29:20.802
Well, Brazil comes back to mind.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.231
Bernie, listen to me,

29:23.231 --> 29:26.124
if you were overcome, like you say,
when this happened…

29:26.124 --> 29:29.544
I was. I, I obviously had
problems with her, Mr Shore,

29:29.544 --> 29:32.062
but I truly never intended to kill her.

29:32.062 --> 29:35.401
I did not conscious…

29:35.930 --> 29:38.295
If we could show heat of passion…

29:38.295 --> 29:41.921
I never broken a law in my life.
She just got me so enraged.

29:41.921 --> 29:44.121
God…

29:44.121 --> 29:45.647
my life is over.

29:45.647 --> 29:47.913
–Mr Ferrion.
–What?

29:47.913 --> 29:49.920
I, uh,

29:50.056 --> 29:52.563
I'm very sorry to tell you,

29:52.563 --> 29:55.673
your mother has passed away.

29:56.727 --> 29:59.300
I beg your pardon?

29:59.300 --> 30:05.031
She went back to sleep,
and she just quietly passed.

30:17.214 --> 30:18.535
To be honest,

30:18.535 --> 30:21.504
I might have a hard time
finding Sudan on a map.

30:21.504 --> 30:23.578
I certainly know
they've got big problems,

30:23.578 --> 30:28.323
innocent people murdered every day,
systemic rape, many of them children.

30:28.323 --> 30:31.142
It's the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world.

30:31.142 --> 30:32.804
Please don't say “but.”

30:32.804 --> 30:34.135
But…

30:34.135 --> 30:38.464
why does every crisis automatically 
fall to the United States to solve?

30:38.464 --> 30:41.569
We've got Iraq, Iran, North Korea.

30:41.569 --> 30:45.091
and these are people 
who might murder us.

30:45.184 --> 30:49.288
We're supposed to tend to a bunch 
of Africans killing each other?

30:49.288 --> 30:53.183
Why? Because we're Americans?

30:53.751 --> 30:55.662
The answer is…

30:55.662 --> 30:58.236
yes.

30:59.114 --> 31:01.471
Because we're Americans.

31:01.471 --> 31:04.404
Because we're a nation,
perhaps the nation,

31:04.404 --> 31:06.949
that's supposed to give a damn.

31:06.949 --> 31:13.225
What's going on is an organized 
extermination of an entire race of people.

31:13.225 --> 31:17.837
We're the country that's 
supposed to give a damn.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.063
Ms Schmidt, Ms Colson,

31:21.063 --> 31:25.141
your claim here most likely 
won't survive some re-judgment and,

31:25.141 --> 31:31.341
maybe the American people don't care
about what's happening over there, but,

31:31.341 --> 31:35.331
for today, here, now,

31:35.331 --> 31:37.760
at least one federal court judge does.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.266
Defendant's motion to dismiss…

31:40.266 --> 31:42.417
Denied!

31:50.099 --> 31:52.042
Can't believe it.

31:52.042 --> 31:54.467
Neither can I.

32:03.985 --> 32:07.810
I thought perhaps
I'd be relieved if she died.

32:07.810 --> 32:10.784
But the truth is, um,

32:11.717 --> 32:15.342
she's all I really had.

32:15.342 --> 32:17.831
I lived with her.

32:19.213 --> 32:22.277
I can't believe she's gone.

32:23.717 --> 32:25.845
She looks at peace.

32:28.569 --> 32:31.995
Though she did on the kitchen 
floor as well.

32:33.992 --> 32:37.652
Mr Shore, can you make 
room for the possibility

32:37.652 --> 32:40.837
that I both killed my mother,

32:40.837 --> 32:44.273
and I'm devastated with losing her?

32:45.884 --> 32:48.002
I can.

32:48.002 --> 32:50.806
I'm so sorry.

32:50.806 --> 32:54.352
Mother, I'm so sorry.

32:56.562 --> 32:57.954
Bernard Ferrion.

32:57.954 --> 32:59.923
That's me.

33:00.256 --> 33:01.492
Kidding.

33:01.492 --> 33:02.983
I'm Bernard Ferrion.

33:02.983 --> 33:05.660
You're under arrest for 
the murder of Della Ferrion.

33:05.660 --> 33:06.889
Please place our hands 
behind your back.

33:06.889 --> 33:09.487
–Yes, sir.
–You have the right to remain silent.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.584
Anything you say can and will be 
used against you in a court of law.

33:12.584 --> 33:15.974
You have the right to hire an attorney
and have him present before any questioning.

33:15.974 --> 33:18.869
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the courts.

33:18.869 --> 33:22.289
You just waive your right to be silent,
make a statement…

33:30.011 --> 33:34.425
32611, commonwealth vs Ferrion,
charge of murder in the first.

33:34.425 --> 33:36.832
Alan Shore appearing 
for the defendant. We'll waive reading.

33:36.832 --> 33:39.910
I'd ask that my client be released
on his own recognizance.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.177
Opposed, the man is 
charged with homicide.

33:42.177 --> 33:43.900
–Bail would certainly…
–He has no record, your honor.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.776
–He would be a threat to society.
–Nonsense.

33:45.776 --> 33:48.666
He only kills mothers, allegedly.
And he's fresh out of them.

33:48.666 --> 33:52.159
Bail is set at $1 million.
Let's conference tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.

33:52.159 --> 33:53.880
We'll set up a trial schedule.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.897
Wait, one second your honor.

33:56.376 --> 33:58.682
It seems there's been 
a terrible mistake.

33:58.682 --> 34:01.262
My client never should 
have been arrested.

34:01.502 --> 34:03.463
–Because?
–There's no evidence.

34:03.463 --> 34:05.129
According to the police report,

34:05.129 --> 34:08.608
there's been no determination
of cause of death, no witnesses.

34:08.608 --> 34:10.976
The victim identified 
the defendant as the killer.

34:10.976 --> 34:13.136
–That would be hearsay.
–It was a dying declaration,

34:13.136 --> 34:15.061
and therefore an exception
to the hearsay rule.

34:15.061 --> 34:17.156
For the dying declaration
exception to apply,

34:17.156 --> 34:20.788
the declarant must know he or she is
about to die when making the statement.

34:20.788 --> 34:23.273
Mrs Ferrion was told by the doctor
she was gonna survive.

34:23.273 --> 34:26.213
She never thought for a second
she was gonna die.

34:26.529 --> 34:27.880
Even so, your honor,

34:27.880 --> 34:31.072
for her to incriminate her own son 
would be a declaration against her interest,

34:31.072 --> 34:34.300
which would also qualify
as an exception to the hearsay rule.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.563
I refer your honor to officer Coulier's…

34:37.563 --> 34:40.193
interviews with the neighbors 
noted at the bottom of the page.

34:40.193 --> 34:43.244
“Mr Ferrion was reportedly 
verbally abused by his mother.”

34:43.244 --> 34:46.041
“She would blame him for anything
that went wrong in her life.”

34:46.041 --> 34:48.574
Well, here again, she was blaming 
him for the bump on her head.

34:48.574 --> 34:51.020
It was not a declaration
against her interests,

34:51.020 --> 34:52.355
but just more of the same.

34:52.355 --> 34:54.715
The court cannot be satisfied
as to its reliability.

34:54.715 --> 34:57.403
The hearsay rule 
very much applies.

34:57.922 --> 35:01.192
Is this all you've got,
the statement of the victim?

35:05.499 --> 35:07.126
We'll get more.

35:07.126 --> 35:10.390
Well, when you do, you can refile.
Right now you've got nothing.

35:10.390 --> 35:12.352
The victim's statement is inadmissible.

35:12.352 --> 35:16.164
The charges against Mr Ferrion
are dismissed without prejudice.

35:18.981 --> 35:22.133
I can't believe it.
I just, I can't believe it.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.887
–It's been an exciting week.
–Do you think they'll be back for me?

35:24.887 --> 35:27.239
Frankly, Bernie, I don't think
they'll get the evidence,

35:27.239 --> 35:30.053
which, I can see, 
brings you right back to.

35:30.053 --> 35:32.117
I can't believe it.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.082
May I say something else?

35:35.399 --> 35:39.452
I see in you, Bernie,
an innately kind person.

35:39.452 --> 35:44.409
A man whose docile, gentle nature

35:44.409 --> 35:49.620
was worn down by a relentlessly 
mean, dark-hearted woman.

35:49.620 --> 35:52.730
I could be wrong, but…

35:54.836 --> 35:57.219
I'm hoping…

35:57.219 --> 36:00.191
it's the kind, gentle person
who goes on from here,

36:00.191 --> 36:02.747
not the one who swung that skillet.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.500
I promise you with all my heart.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.375
You don't have to worry about that.

36:09.867 --> 36:11.224
Bernie,

36:11.224 --> 36:15.384
through your grief,
which I know is very real,

36:15.384 --> 36:18.104
try to see this as an opportunity.

36:18.104 --> 36:20.662
For once, finally,

36:20.662 --> 36:24.607
you get to live your 
life free of mother.

36:41.264 --> 36:43.107
<i>Now, international news.</i>

36:43.107 --> 36:46.765
<i>According to the United Nations
secretary general Kofi Annan,</i>

36:46.765 --> 36:51.493
<i>one in three people in Darfur
now requires lifesaving assistance,</i>

36:51.493 --> 36:54.321
<i>due to either violence or malnutrition.</i>

36:54.321 --> 36:57.077
<i>Efforts to negotiate a peaceful 
solution to the underlying…</i>

36:57.077 --> 36:58.226
What you doing?

36:58.226 --> 36:59.961
Watching the news.

37:00.587 --> 37:03.172
CBS just declared Bush the winner.

37:07.182 --> 37:09.579
–Cheers.
–Cheers.

37:10.407 --> 37:13.551
I see our little case is getting play.

37:14.173 --> 37:17.011
You think it could actually 
make a difference?

37:19.671 --> 37:24.615
I remember reading 
when the press went to Bosnia,

37:24.615 --> 37:27.402
people rejoiced at the sight
of American media.

37:27.402 --> 37:30.157
They figured if word got out,
something would be done,

37:30.157 --> 37:33.354
murders and rapes would stop.

37:33.779 --> 37:35.405
They waited…

37:35.405 --> 37:37.782
and they waited…

37:37.782 --> 37:40.058
and nobody came.

37:40.844 --> 37:43.921
Maybe we need Sudan to attack us.

37:44.691 --> 37:49.063
We might fall short as humanitarians,
but we're pretty good avengers.

37:49.355 --> 37:54.335
If you don't mind, I'll cling to the idea 
we're still pretty decent humanitarians.

37:57.965 --> 37:59.655
What's that?

37:59.655 --> 38:02.727
I don't know. I thought it was from you.
I was waiting to open it.

38:02.727 --> 38:04.346
It's not from me.

38:13.217 --> 38:18.060
“Objects in mirror are 
bigger than they appear.”

38:18.639 --> 38:20.973
He's funny.

38:21.944 --> 38:24.770
He's also trouble, isn't he?

38:29.517 --> 38:31.457
She's big trouble.

38:31.457 --> 38:33.662
Did she break your heart?

38:33.876 --> 38:35.947
She might have.

38:37.773 --> 38:39.562
So what?

38:40.461 --> 38:43.130
I've had my heart 
broken lots of times.

38:43.477 --> 38:46.175
It stings for a minute.

38:47.140 --> 38:50.045
I would think it would 
be fun to have her back.

38:50.045 --> 38:52.535
I don't know about you,
but when I travel,

38:52.535 --> 38:55.064
going to new places 
isn't always as interesting

38:55.064 --> 38:57.776
as revisiting some of the old ones.

39:01.461 --> 39:04.975
What is it that has 
you so balled up?

39:07.401 --> 39:10.313
She isn't slipping, that's what.

39:12.098 --> 39:15.343
You're worried about 
her seeing you age?

39:17.269 --> 39:19.421
You might not believe this.

39:20.694 --> 39:24.037
But I was once 
a very remarkable man.

39:25.398 --> 39:27.295
Denny.

39:28.782 --> 39:30.965
Denny.

39:32.259 --> 39:35.269
You're a remarkable man.

39:39.762 --> 39:42.483
Between you and me,

39:43.165 --> 39:47.151
that woman is too much for me.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.298
Between you and me,

39:54.298 --> 39:56.352
we'll take her.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.785
I'd like that.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.221
I'd like that.
