WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.334
- [gasps]
- [both] Oh, my gosh!

00:04.938 --> 00:08.540
<i>[Randy] Some girls dream about
their wedding day their whole life.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:09.641
So nervous.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.642
[exhales]

00:10.677 --> 00:13.379
<i>[Randy] They picture
the perfect dress...</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:16.382
Pull up on a horse and a
carriage and stop the show,

00:16.384 --> 00:17.783
take everyone's breath away.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.085
<i>[Randy] ...what their family
and friends will think of it...</i>

00:20.087 --> 00:21.887
- Positive vibes. Let's go.
- Yes.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.857
<i>[Randy] ...and how their
future partner will react to it.</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:27.226
I could see her in
something with, like, topless.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.294
But all bets are off
when it comes to

00:29.296 --> 00:31.964
actually shopping for
that dream dress.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.533
I will not settle for anything
less than perfection.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.037
With expectations this high,

00:38.039 --> 00:41.106
there's bound to be some
shocking moments along the way.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.875
[both] Wow!

00:42.877 --> 00:44.043
[Monique] Mindy, don't hate me,

00:44.045 --> 00:46.078
I don't like any of them.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.582
[Randy] <i>And the
surprises kept coming.</i>

00:51.651 --> 00:54.453
<i>Today, we're going to
take a look back at</i>

00:54.455 --> 00:56.922
some of my favorite
surprises to happen

00:56.924 --> 00:59.458
right here on this pedestal.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.939
As you might have noticed,

01:13.941 --> 01:16.208
things look a little
different around here lately.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.943
Kleinfeld's made a few changes

01:17.945 --> 01:20.512
to take care of our brides
in these uncertain times

01:20.514 --> 01:23.949
while I took care of things
at my other home in Florida.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.217
Well, sort of.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.885
Ah!

01:26.887 --> 01:28.153
Don't get your foot caught.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.155
<i>But we'll talk a little
more about that later.</i>

01:30.157 --> 01:31.857
Okay, let's get back to work.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.926
<i>I may have been over
a thousand miles away,</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:36.195
<i>but I was still in
full bridal mode</i>

01:36.197 --> 01:38.997
<i>and had a blast
surprising all my brides.</i>

01:38.999 --> 01:41.333
<i>- Hello, beautiful.
- [gasps] Randy!</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:43.135
- [Mindy] We have Randy here.
- Hello, beautiful.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.903
Oh, my God!

01:44.905 --> 01:46.939
I'm leaving with a Randy
dress. I hope you know that!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.173
<i>Hey, there!</i>

01:48.175 --> 01:51.677
[gasps] Oh, God, I
dropped a dress, too.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.446
<i>[Randy] Oh, my gosh,
she was so surprised.</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:55.981
So, Daniela is
my production assistant.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.015
Daniela, come here.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.450
- Oh, my gosh.
- Come here, join me.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.619
- [chuckles] Hey, gorgeous.
- Hello.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.820
- How are you?
- Good.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.222
So, you were
obviously surprised.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.957
I was.
But you know what?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.292
I was more surprised
by your brutal honesty.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.994
[laughs]

02:08.996 --> 02:11.964
I was brutally honest, but
that's just 'cause I love you.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.165
Aw!

02:13.167 --> 02:15.134
[Amber] So, what do we think?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.902
[Daniela] It feels
really good on.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.637
I'm not feeling this at all.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.773
- [gasps]
- [all] Wow!

02:21.775 --> 02:24.176
- [Daniela] Okay.
- The honesty, okay, we need that.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.446
<i>[Randy] I'm not a huge
fan of the charmeuse</i>

02:27.448 --> 02:29.848
<i>because it's so silky and shiny</i>

02:29.850 --> 02:33.118
that it shows every
little bump and bulge,

02:33.120 --> 02:35.320
and I don't like
anything about it.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.588
[laughs]

02:36.590 --> 02:42.161
I've never seen this brutally
honest side of Randy before.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.963
<i>I would like to think that
it's a sign of endearment,</i>

02:44.965 --> 02:49.201
<i>but I was not expecting
to get a hard no so quickly.</i>

02:49.203 --> 02:50.936
I just think you
could find something

02:50.938 --> 02:53.372
<i>so much more
beautiful than this.</i>

02:53.374 --> 02:55.140
I knew it came
from a place of love.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.009
It just still really shocked me.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.110
[both laughing]

02:58.112 --> 03:00.279
I mean, I think everyone
was a little surprised

03:00.281 --> 03:03.248
at my harshness, like,
"Wow, he's tough," right?

03:03.250 --> 03:07.186
Yeah. But it ended up working
out in a better way for me

03:07.188 --> 03:11.156
because we ended up finding
something that was more suited...

03:11.158 --> 03:12.658
- Your dress.
- My dress.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.226
- It was your dress.
- Yeah.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.961
All right, she's coming out.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.196
Oh, my gosh!

03:31.144 --> 03:32.277
- Oh.
- Wow!

03:32.279 --> 03:33.845
- Oh, my goodness!
- [all] Wow!

03:33.847 --> 03:37.082
[Amber] This is
absolutely stunning.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.551
Okay, now this is what
I've been waiting for!

03:41.254 --> 03:44.289
You look gorgeous!

03:44.291 --> 03:45.457
[sighs]

03:46.359 --> 03:48.093
[Daniela speaking]

03:48.095 --> 03:49.795
[all laughing]

03:49.797 --> 03:51.096
Do you guys like it?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.465
- Hell yeah.
- Oh, I love it. Love it. Love it.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.433
It's a very special moment.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.501
You're surrounded by
people that love you.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.972
The crew seems to love it.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.473
Randy loves it.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.941
<i>I've found the dress.</i>

04:02.943 --> 04:04.409
It feels so good.

04:04.411 --> 04:09.114
[all] Daniela, are you
saying yes to the dress?

04:09.116 --> 04:12.150
- Yes.
- [all cheering]

04:17.290 --> 04:19.124
That was an amazing day.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.792
It really was.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.160
- I-- - What happened
to your voice?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.363
I was just going to, I
was just going to tell you,

04:24.365 --> 04:26.765
I just got back from
my bachelorette party.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.433
<i>It was a little bit
too much fun.</i>

04:28.435 --> 04:30.302
<i>There was a megaphone involved,</i>

04:30.304 --> 04:31.903
<i>a little bit of screaming.</i>

04:31.905 --> 04:35.173
<i>I don't, I don't know what
happened, but here we are.</i>

04:35.175 --> 04:37.743
So I'm going to-- I'll
let you keep doing this

04:37.745 --> 04:38.744
and I'll come back
in a little bit.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.012
Okay, come back
and check with...

04:40.014 --> 04:41.480
- Okay, okay, perfect.
- Check with me.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.615
She really is amazing.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.254
From last minute wishes...

04:49.256 --> 04:52.057
My wedding is two
and a half months away.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.859
Okay.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.893
Yeah.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.328
The contradicting wishes.

04:56.330 --> 04:59.364
I envision for her
to show a little skin.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.201
- I wouldn't... No.
- [laughs]

05:03.203 --> 05:07.172
Our brides have really thrown
our consultants some curve balls.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.875
Lisa and I were especially
shocked when we found out

05:09.877 --> 05:11.343
we'd be helping
a bride named Shaela,

05:11.345 --> 05:14.980
who became blind after
a devastating car accident

05:14.982 --> 05:17.182
<i>right before her 16th birthday.</i>

05:17.184 --> 05:20.352
We weren't quite sure how
she'd shopped for a wedding dress,

05:20.354 --> 05:24.089
but the answer was
actually quite surprising.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.258
[Shaela] Can I feel that
dress before I put it on?

05:26.260 --> 05:28.160
[Lisa] Oh, sure.
Let me bring it to you.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.828
<i>[Shaela] Texture is
very important to me.</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:31.263
When I'm feeling a dress,

05:31.265 --> 05:33.265
it's just, if it's just plain,

05:33.267 --> 05:36.335
it's kind of boring
to me. [laughs]

05:36.337 --> 05:38.770
This dress, it's so detailed,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.539
and I love that about it.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.210
She feels beautiful
in this dress, I can tell.

05:45.212 --> 05:49.648
Even though Shaela can't
see herself in this dress,

05:49.650 --> 05:53.785
<i>the number one thing
that I tell every single bride</i>

05:53.787 --> 05:57.522
is that you have to feel
beautiful in your dress.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.825
I just love how it
feels in this area.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.693
[Lisa] Okay.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.997
In this one, she looks
glamorous and sexy...

06:05.999 --> 06:07.866
- Yeah, it is just what I want.
- But elegant.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.401
- [Shaela] Luxurious.
- [woman] Yes.

06:09.635 --> 06:10.936
It's everything.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.707
<i>It's interesting because
I've had such a hard time</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:18.276
describing what
type of dress I want.

06:18.278 --> 06:22.247
<i>But yet when I have
this dress on me,</i>

06:22.249 --> 06:25.083
I feel that exact feeling
that I can't describe.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.352
You're very beautiful, honey,

06:27.354 --> 06:30.455
and don't ever let anybody
tell you anything different, okay?

06:32.425 --> 06:34.459
I feel like a bride.

06:34.461 --> 06:39.898
[all] Shaela, are you
saying yes to the dress?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.334
- Yes!
- [all cheering]

06:46.406 --> 06:49.941
We did it. Yeah.
I found it.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.243
- I found it.
- It's beautiful.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.912
[all cheering]

06:53.914 --> 06:55.313
<i>[Randy] I mean,
we've seen it all.</i>

06:55.315 --> 06:58.817
Amber, Mindy, and I
tackled a double appointment

06:58.819 --> 07:00.652
where the brides wanted
to keep their dresses

07:00.654 --> 07:02.387
a surprise from one another.

07:03.656 --> 07:04.990
I'm so happy for you.
I want to see it.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.091
[Alayna] No, you're
not allowed to see it.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.292
- Come on.
- [Alayna] No.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.094
- Just like a peek.
- [Alayna] I'll give you a hint.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.929
- [Chloe] Okay.
- There's white on it.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.663
[Chloe] Oh, thanks.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.166
[Alayna laughs]

07:14.168 --> 07:17.969
But our bride, Chloe, who
is transgender, surprised us

07:17.971 --> 07:21.139
when we learned just how
monumental it was for her

07:21.141 --> 07:23.175
<i>just to be trying on
wedding dresses.</i>

07:23.177 --> 07:26.178
For me, you know, this
is an amazing experience

07:26.180 --> 07:27.312
'cause I was married
once before,

07:27.314 --> 07:31.583
<i>before I transitioned.
And I was in a tuxedo.</i>

07:31.585 --> 07:33.118
<i>[Randy] This is really exciting</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:37.422
'cause it's really her first time
to really, like, truly be herself.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.191
- Yes.
<i>- [Randy] Yeah.</i>

07:39.193 --> 07:41.126
- [all] Yes.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

07:42.094 --> 07:45.230
- Yes, absolutely.
- So pretty.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.032
[woman] Yes.
Look at that face.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.034
She's got that beautiful face.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.536
[Chloe] Yup.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.904
- This is it.
- [Amber] You love it?

07:52.906 --> 07:53.905
Yeah, I love it.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.106
- Yes.
- Don't look...

07:55.108 --> 07:56.842
You know, there was
a time in my life

07:56.844 --> 07:58.376
where, like, I didn't think
this day would ever come,

07:58.378 --> 08:01.179
just where we're at with society

08:01.181 --> 08:04.316
and had that fear that...

08:04.318 --> 08:08.019
I'd never get to, you
know, live my authentic life.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.921
<i>And to be here today,</i>

08:09.923 --> 08:11.490
you know, feeling amazing

08:11.492 --> 08:14.626
in this gorgeous dress
at Kleinfeld's, like...

08:14.628 --> 08:16.361
[woman]
Making me cry.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.766
Not just, you know, what
I'm wearing to the wedding,

08:21.768 --> 08:24.302
but just who I am as a
person is different this time.

08:24.304 --> 08:28.039
And I'm able to bring my
whole self into this relationship.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.275
[Randy] <i>It's a
beautiful thing to see</i>

08:30.277 --> 08:33.812
when somebody is able to
really express who they are

08:33.814 --> 08:35.213
and come out of their shell

08:35.215 --> 08:36.915
and not have to hide
from the world.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.417
- Are you ready, Randy?
<i>- [Randy] I'm ready.</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:43.388
Chloe...

08:43.390 --> 08:45.624
[Amber and Randy] ...are
you saying yes to the dress?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.993
- Yes.
- [all cheering]

08:49.529 --> 08:51.630
- [Amber] Congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.664
Yes!

09:00.640 --> 09:03.174
- Let's do it.
- Let's go get our brides.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.077
Krissy and Candace were
excited for their double appointment,

09:06.079 --> 09:09.014
but they never expected
this bombshell.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.983
So, now, what are
your relationships?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.386
This is my husband
and this is my fiance.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.055
- [both] Wow!
- [Kassadra] Yeah.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.323
[Kassandra]
<i>We are in a throuple.</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:19.357
<i>We are all in love.</i>

09:19.359 --> 09:22.761
Yeah, we're in a
polyamorous relationship, so.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.697
One man who has multiple
wives is usually polygamy.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.633
Polyamory is when multiple
people have more than one love.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.269
Yeah, I mean, we
sleep in the same bed.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.437
- That means double the cuddles.
- Yeah.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.005
[Carly speaking]

09:34.373 --> 09:36.007
- [Krissy] Oh!
- I know, I know.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.509
I didn't want to scare
you guys, but that's--

09:37.511 --> 09:40.145
- Scared? No. No.
- [all laughing]

09:40.147 --> 09:42.180
[Candace] No one's
scared. We're ready.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.282
And to think that was
only the beginning

09:44.284 --> 09:47.052
of this shocking,
but very fun day.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.121
[exclaims]

09:51.891 --> 09:52.857
[Fanny speaking Spanish]

09:52.859 --> 09:56.161
How beautiful is this dress!

09:56.163 --> 09:59.130
I didn't think that the
first dress that I tried on

09:59.132 --> 10:01.299
<i>would feel like
it's my dream dress,</i>

10:01.301 --> 10:05.904
<i>I have chills
and I have butterflies.</i>

10:05.906 --> 10:09.441
This is stunning.
This is stunning.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.177
[Carly] Oh, my God, you
guys are all getting emotional.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.878
Stop.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.914
Instantly you put it on, you
were like, "Yeah, this is it"?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.115
<i>[Carly] Instantly.</i>

10:17.149 --> 10:19.250
[Kassandra] <i>Do you
realize how impressive it is?</i>

10:19.252 --> 10:21.186
It's like your first dress that
you tried on, that's crazy.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.654
Yeah.

10:22.656 --> 10:26.358
To a consultant, one and done
is always a pleasant surprise,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.893
<i>but it actually took
Kassandra's mom to pull a gown</i>

10:28.895 --> 10:31.262
that would make her
dream dress a reality.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.531
I'm actually, I'm impressed.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.233
With a catch.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.970
[Fanny gasping]

10:38.972 --> 10:40.271
[all] Oh.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.507
This one...

10:42.509 --> 10:44.876
- Say, "Thank you, Mama."
- Thank you, Mommy.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.145
- But, Mom...
- Oh.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.347
- There's a "but"?
- Yes, I know. I know.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.482
The price tag.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.951
- The price tag?
- [Kassandra] Yes.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.287
- [imitates explosion]
- Oh, yes!

10:56.289 --> 11:01.459
<i>[Kassandra] So, this
dress is $1,600 over budget.</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:06.665
- Without tax?
- Without tax, 8.8%.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.199
[all laughing]

11:10.202 --> 11:14.105
Do we donate to the
dresses that are killers.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.440
It's up to you.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.575
- Yeah.
- This has to be it.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.810
This has to be it.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.645
So...

11:21.380 --> 11:25.083
[both] ...Kassandra
and Carly,

11:25.085 --> 11:28.219
are you saying yes to the dress?

11:29.422 --> 11:31.122
[both] Yes.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.158
[all cheering and applauding]

11:33.993 --> 11:35.927
Pao is going to be in awe.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.928
<i>- He is...
- [Kassandra] Mm-hmm.</i>

11:36.930 --> 11:40.432
I know that he is
going to love our picks.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.334
- So, he...
- He's gonna be blown away.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.836
- Everyone's in?
- [all] Yes!

11:44.838 --> 11:46.504
[all] Yay!

11:51.410 --> 11:54.245
<i>[Randy] Appointments can
definitely be full of surprises,</i>

11:54.247 --> 11:56.314
and not all of them are welcome.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.017
I'm six weeks away
from my wedding.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.320
These last-minute brides
send me on a whirlwind.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.222
I hope it fits.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.462
<i>♪ Nothing can
stop me ♪</i>

12:10.464 --> 12:14.332
<i>♪ No, no, nothing can
stop me ♪</i>

12:14.334 --> 12:16.201
While searching for the
perfect wedding dress,

12:16.203 --> 12:19.137
a bride should expect
the unexpected.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.973
They might be shocked
to find themselves in love.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.942
Oh, my God!

12:24.076 --> 12:25.677
Uh-oh!

12:25.679 --> 12:29.114
Or to find that their entourage
doesn't share the love.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.349
It's too much to take in.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.951
It's overwhelming.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.419
Do I look like a queen?

12:34.421 --> 12:35.620
I don't like that dress.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.691
Do you think we could try
it with the skirt and a veil?

12:39.693 --> 12:41.059
No.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.097
I mean, I think Ryleigh knew
she'd have a tough crowd to impress

12:46.099 --> 12:47.332
<i>since her family appeared on</i>

12:47.334 --> 12:49.267
<i>the hit reality
TV show Dance Moms,</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:51.936
and they were used to
perfecting their public image.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.873
But consultant Kelsey
had a little surprise

12:54.875 --> 12:57.475
waiting in the wings just in
case she needed backup.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.145
I, like, still have butterflies.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.947
I don't know.
I love this.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.250
My mom is not
completely sold on it,

13:05.252 --> 13:07.118
and my heart drops

13:07.120 --> 13:09.888
<i>because I don't think I
could say yes to a dress</i>

13:09.890 --> 13:12.957
<i>knowing that she
doesn't completely love it.</i>

13:15.161 --> 13:17.295
- Mom?
- [sighs softly]

13:17.297 --> 13:20.098
- What?
- It cuts right here a little.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.233
<i>I think Ryleigh
is curvy as it is,</i>

13:22.235 --> 13:23.902
<i>and I think a mermaid dress</i>

13:23.904 --> 13:26.137
kind of adds to
some of those curves,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.306
<i>and I would hate if some day</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:30.308
<i>she looked back 10 years
from now at the pictures</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:32.577
and thought, "Oh gosh,
Mom, my thighs."

13:36.048 --> 13:37.882
- In the end, it's what you want.
- Yeah.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.084
I'm going to get the
designer on FaceTime

13:40.086 --> 13:41.386
<i>because I think
she'll be perfect</i>

13:41.388 --> 13:43.855
to answer any
questions that Jill has.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.157
I have a very special
guest here.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.525
This is Martine.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.862
- [all] Hi!
<i>- [Martine] Hi, guys!</i>

13:50.864 --> 13:52.096
[all] Hello.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.231
[Martine]
<i>How are you?</i>

13:53.233 --> 13:55.767
I am obsessed with this dress.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.769
It's literally my dream dress.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.138
<i>[Martine] You just
look perfect in it.</i>

14:00.140 --> 14:03.341
[Kelsey] So, Martine, Ryleigh's
mom, Jill, had some questions

14:03.343 --> 14:06.845
about how much flare
we get at the bottom.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.180
We wanted to soften
this up a little bit.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.082
[Martine] <i>We could
definitely take some out</i>

14:11.084 --> 14:13.384
<i>in alterations to just give
it a much softer effect.</i>

14:13.386 --> 14:16.221
Okay, yay.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.389
- Yay.
- Perfect, that's what we wanted.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.925
Yay! It's the one.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.961
- [gasps]
- [all] Wow!

14:22.963 --> 14:25.563
If Mom says it's the one,
it's a game-changer then.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.332
It's making my eyes water.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.399
Ryleigh,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.103
are you saying yes to the dress?

14:32.105 --> 14:34.472
- Yes!
- [all cheering]

14:36.075 --> 14:37.942
[Jill] It's the dress.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.411
<i>[Ryleigh] I needed my
mom to give me her approval</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:42.313
<i>just because it means
so much to me</i>

14:42.315 --> 14:43.982
and I'm so happy
that you love it.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.284
- I'm happy you love it.
- [both laugh]

14:47.887 --> 14:50.755
<i>[Randy] Kelsey's quick
thinking saved the day.</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:52.857
<i>Ryleigh and her mom will
now have to envision</i>

14:52.859 --> 14:55.159
how the dress will
look with alterations.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.862
But imagine never having
seen your entire dress

14:57.864 --> 14:59.964
in person before your wedding.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.032
You've never touched it,

15:01.034 --> 15:02.834
seen how your body fits in it,

15:02.836 --> 15:05.837
- or anyone's reaction to it.
- I'm nervous.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.138
<i>That was Christen's reality</i>

15:07.140 --> 15:10.141
when just six weeks
before her wedding,

15:10.143 --> 15:12.810
she arrived at Kleinfeld
to finally see the dress

15:12.812 --> 15:14.812
she'd chosen during
a virtual appointment.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.882
- Are you ready?
- No. [laughs]

15:17.884 --> 15:22.120
Good or bad, she was
certainly in for a revelation.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.121
Is that what it looks like?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.489
Oh, no.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.291
[Lisa] There's another
layer. Don't worry.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.325
[both laugh]

15:27.327 --> 15:29.060
You're freaking me out.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.429
[laughs] You're freaking me out.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.631
Just with COVID and
the travel restrictions,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.133
<i>in order to get the dress today,</i>

15:35.135 --> 15:38.336
I could only be in the State
of New York for 24 hours.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.040
<i>So, if I hate the dress, um...</i>

15:42.975 --> 15:44.976
Okay, that's,
that's scary. Like...

15:44.978 --> 15:47.378
[breathes deeply]

15:47.380 --> 15:50.181
- [Lisa] Look at the train.
- Oh, my...

15:51.517 --> 15:53.952
- I love it!
- Yay!

15:53.954 --> 15:56.087
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh! You love it.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.221
It's gorgeous.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.258
Are you ready?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.127
Come up on the pedestal.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.963
- [Christen] Oh, gosh!
- Look at this.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.432
Oh, yeah.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.070
[Lisa] So, are you
feeling relieved?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.471
[Christen] Absolutely.
[laughs]

16:15.341 --> 16:18.876
Are you saying yes
again to the dress?

16:18.878 --> 16:20.345
I'm saying yes again.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.047
- [all cheering]
- Love it, love it.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.583
High-fives so we
don't get makeup on it.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.886
[Christen] <i>We've
waited all these months</i>

16:28.888 --> 16:31.189
<i>and it was even more
beautiful in person,</i>

16:31.191 --> 16:33.758
and I'm just freaking out
because I have a dress

16:33.760 --> 16:34.692
and I'm bringing it home

16:34.694 --> 16:36.461
and I'm going to get married.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.933
This was not only Christen's
first time seeing her dress,

16:41.935 --> 16:45.003
it was also her first
time getting it fitted.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.439
Fitting appointments can
definitely be full of surprises,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.441
and not all of them are welcome,

16:50.443 --> 16:52.343
as our next bride
Kelsey found out

16:52.345 --> 16:54.345
just weeks before her wedding.

16:56.982 --> 17:00.151
I'm here today to have my
second fitting for my dress.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.386
Perfect.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.654
It's beautiful, Kelsey.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.558
[Evangelista speaking]

17:10.662 --> 17:11.963
Okay.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.402
[chuckles nervously]
That's not good.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.038
We're missing the belt,
which is a little alarming.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.806
[Evangelista speaking]

17:21.808 --> 17:25.877
It's definitely been part
of the vision all along.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.145
<i>So, to not have it now</i>

17:27.147 --> 17:29.147
<i>and especially when we're
this close to the wedding</i>

17:29.149 --> 17:31.916
<i>and there may not be
time to get another one,</i>

17:31.918 --> 17:34.218
I just have a little
pitter-patter in my heart.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.953
[woman speaking]

17:37.356 --> 17:38.423
[Evangelista speaking]

17:38.957 --> 17:40.158
I'm nervous.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.959
We need, we need
the complete picture.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.662
[woman speaking]

17:47.366 --> 17:49.067
[exhales sharply]

17:50.202 --> 17:51.502
[cheering]

17:52.004 --> 17:53.337
- Thank goodness.
- Perfect.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.406
- We got the belt.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.941
[Scott]
<i>The belt makes it.</i>

17:56.943 --> 17:58.476
The belt completes the look

17:58.478 --> 18:00.845
<i>and it's absolutely necessary.</i>

18:00.847 --> 18:04.115
<i>And now that we can
see that, it's perfect.</i>

18:04.117 --> 18:05.583
It's just what I wanted.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.656
Oh, my gosh. Thank
goodness they found that.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.425
Natalia got a big shock
during her first appointment, too.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.229
<i>It was nowhere near the fit she
remembered when she bought it.</i>

18:18.231 --> 18:20.298
She arrived at her
next appointment

18:20.300 --> 18:22.633
hoping for no more curve balls.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.203
But her mom had other ideas.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.105
<i>[Natalia] I'm most
concerned about</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:28.239
<i>it not hitting me
in the right place.</i>

18:28.241 --> 18:31.409
I want to make sure it
accentuates my waist.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.011
[AJ] Yes, that's what I
want. Big difference there.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.947
AJ totally understood
what I was saying.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.148
<i>He listened to me.</i>

18:37.182 --> 18:40.218
<i>He put everything, all
the pins in the right spots</i>

18:40.220 --> 18:42.887
<i>to make it so it's giving
me that silhouette shape.</i>

18:42.889 --> 18:44.188
<i>So, now, I'm feeling good now.</i>

18:44.823 --> 18:46.858
You chose the right style dress.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.093
Oh, yeah. I know
my body for sure.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.062
We have a little surprise today.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.364
<i>Natalia wanted a second dress.</i>

18:53.366 --> 18:55.967
<i>She tried it on, she loved it,</i>

18:55.969 --> 18:58.136
<i>but her budget didn't allow it.</i>

18:58.138 --> 19:00.238
<i>Fortunately, I was
able to work it out.</i>

19:00.240 --> 19:01.172
<i>They got the dress.</i>

19:01.174 --> 19:03.374
She has no idea.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.077
And you can definitely see
a little bit more of the sheer.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.278
Yeah.

19:09.248 --> 19:12.216
[woman]
Natalia, Natalia.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.153
- No way!
- That's your dress.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.991
[Mary speaking]

19:19.993 --> 19:21.159
[crying]

19:21.393 --> 19:23.494
Oh, my gosh!

19:24.596 --> 19:26.531
Oh, my gosh!

19:27.966 --> 19:30.401
Oh, my gosh!
Thank you.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.837
Wow. I was not
expecting that.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.305
Oh, my gosh!

19:34.307 --> 19:36.941
I don't know how my
mom pulled this one off.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.911
She kept it from me.
She's good.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.346
- [Mary] Can we look?
- You can look.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.249
Oh, my God.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.220
- Sexy, too.
- Whoo!

19:49.222 --> 19:50.988
- Hot mama.
- Oh, my God.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.357
Totally different look, right?

19:53.359 --> 19:56.427
This is, like, simple,
sleek, sexy, I don't know.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.763
Natalia, are you kidding?

19:58.765 --> 19:59.931
[Natalia] I know.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.432
- [Mary] Damn, girl.
- [woman] Wow.

20:02.301 --> 20:06.170
As a mother, you just
want your child to be happy.

20:06.172 --> 20:10.541
<i>And I knew her heart
was as full as my heart</i>

20:10.543 --> 20:11.943
<i>when she saw that second dress.</i>

20:11.945 --> 20:13.344
Woo-hoo!

20:17.516 --> 20:19.850
We love those little surprises

20:19.852 --> 20:22.820
that take an appointment
just over the top.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.922
But sometimes we just
don't have time to show you

20:24.924 --> 20:26.757
every one of those surprises.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.427
One of my favorites comes
from a bride named Stacey.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.762
She came in with
a last minute request

20:31.764 --> 20:34.899
that rocked our
consultant Candace's day.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.501
[Stacey] <i>We have
been trying on dresses,</i>

20:37.503 --> 20:39.036
haven't found anything yet.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.104
Everything...

20:40.106 --> 20:42.840
I mean, I'm six weeks
away from my wedding,

20:42.842 --> 20:44.375
<i>so we don't have much time,</i>

20:44.377 --> 20:45.977
so they have to pull the items

20:45.979 --> 20:48.412
that they have
available on the floor.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.649
These last-minute brides
send m on a whirlwind.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.850
Stacey...

20:52.852 --> 20:54.785
[Stacey]
<i>I feel defeated,</i>

20:54.787 --> 20:58.522
but I feel like Kleinfeld
has a lot of dresses

20:58.524 --> 21:00.358
and one has my name on it.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.160
This is the wow.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.062
I have a lot of faith
in this dress.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.064
I hope it fits.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.532
Oh, please let this dress fit.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.468
- Let it be it.
- [woman] Amen.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.038
Yes and yes.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.540
- I love it.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.543
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yes.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.379
That's how you come in

21:21.381 --> 21:23.014
after your fabulous
ceremony dress.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.248
Yes, ma'am, honey.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.283
This is saying something.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.585
[Aikisha] Yes,
this... Yes!

21:28.920 --> 21:30.988
Yes, baby, this is it.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.557
We gonna mess up our makeup.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.294
[woman] It has that wow factor.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.662
[Stacey] Yeah.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.864
Stacey knew her ask
was monumental

21:39.866 --> 21:42.133
and worried her budget
might not be enough,

21:42.135 --> 21:44.935
<i>but in the end,
Candace came through</i>

21:44.937 --> 21:47.371
However, her entourage
came prepared

21:47.373 --> 21:49.307
in this never before
seen moment.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.474
Take a look.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.943
- Yes.
- This was what was missing.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.345
That's what was missing.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.047
You wanted it to have that...

21:56.049 --> 21:57.381
[Aikisha] Well, I have
something else that's missing.

21:57.383 --> 21:59.617
Got a little surprise, surprise.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.488
- Okay.
- Your boo sent us a little message.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.357
<i>First and foremost,</i>

22:06.625 --> 22:08.826
your boy out here looking like an
R&B singer with this background.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.127
[laughs]

22:10.129 --> 22:11.929
But I just want to
tell you that I love you

22:11.931 --> 22:13.164
from the bottom of my heart

22:13.166 --> 22:14.732
<i>and I wish I was
there with you today</i>

22:14.734 --> 22:16.067
<i>to help you pick out your dress.</i>

22:16.069 --> 22:18.703
But then again,
I'm glad that I'm not,

22:18.705 --> 22:21.839
so I can be just as surprised to
see you walking down that aisle

22:21.841 --> 22:25.242
looking as beautiful as
the first day that I saw you.

22:25.244 --> 22:28.979
Now I know dresses can be
kind of expensive where you're at,

22:28.981 --> 22:30.915
and I know that
we have a budget,

22:30.917 --> 22:33.184
<i>but there's no way I'm
gonna let you walk out of there</i>

22:33.186 --> 22:36.020
<i>without getting exactly
what you want.</i>

22:36.022 --> 22:38.989
<i>So just know, no
matter what the cost is,</i>

22:38.991 --> 22:41.125
your boy got an
extra $50 for you

22:41.127 --> 22:43.494
- right here when you get back.
- [all laugh]

22:43.496 --> 22:45.963
I love you, babe.
Have a great time.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.466
Not $50.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.369
What do you want me
to do with that! So sweet.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.971
- Aww!
- Thanks, y'all.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.406
[sniffles] Thanks.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.908
- Ooh, what a day!
- [all laughing]

22:57.910 --> 22:59.677
The day was rough

22:59.679 --> 23:02.246
because I thought I was
going home with nothing.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.382
<i>But in the end,</i>

23:04.384 --> 23:08.052
<i>I found my dress and
I said yes to the dress.</i>

23:10.255 --> 23:13.023
What a sweet surprise
from Stacey's fiance.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.727
Little did we know she was
holding on to a secret of her own.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.162
<i>And Stacey couldn't
wait to share it</i>

23:18.164 --> 23:21.665
<i>with her friends and family
at her wedding reception.</i>

23:21.667 --> 23:26.470
This dress is not only a reception
party dress, we have a big surprise.

23:26.472 --> 23:29.073
<i>A baby bump is going to be
showing through this dress.</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:30.808
<i>During our reception,</i>

23:30.810 --> 23:32.843
<i>we will be doing a gender reveal</i>

23:32.845 --> 23:36.113
<i>and our entire family will
find out at the same time.</i>

23:36.115 --> 23:37.515
Many of them don't know.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.358
[man]
Ladies and gentleman...

23:48.994 --> 23:51.429
[all cheering]

23:54.232 --> 23:56.634
I just found out we're having...

23:56.636 --> 23:59.103
- A girl...
- a baby girl.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.606
You about to be a girl dad.

24:08.313 --> 24:11.382
Our brides dished out plenty
of surprises this season,

24:11.384 --> 24:13.851
and it wasn't what
anyone expected.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.554
- [gasps]
- [both] Oh, my gosh!

24:23.962 --> 24:25.963
Our brides were
on the receiving end

24:25.965 --> 24:27.698
of plenty of surprises
this season.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.267
Yes!

24:30.269 --> 24:32.436
But they also dished
out a few of their own.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.938
[all cheering]

24:33.940 --> 24:36.040
- Oh.
- I got to be able to...

24:36.042 --> 24:38.275
You got to
dance in it? Okay.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.977
I'm actually a fashion designer.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.212
You are.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.279
Bridal and evening wear.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.181
- Wait, really?
- Really?

24:44.183 --> 24:46.116
Kim shocked this designer

24:46.118 --> 24:49.720
when she revealed that she
also designed wedding dresses,

24:49.722 --> 24:51.956
but there was another
surprise coming my way

24:51.958 --> 24:55.559
that I have to say is
just too cute not to share.

24:55.561 --> 24:59.930
So, this is a little something
from the heart from me to you.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.465
Aw!

25:01.467 --> 25:03.100
- Thank you.
- I'll give this to you.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.443
[Randy] Okay.

25:13.411 --> 25:15.679
- [gasps]
- [both] Oh, my gosh!

25:15.681 --> 25:17.214
Chewy.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.185
- Oh, my God, you did this?
- [Kimberly] I did.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.988
So I'm also
a pet portrait artist.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.256
[gasps]

25:26.024 --> 25:27.858
And I had to do it.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.327
This is absolute perfection.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.730
Really, honestly,
thank you. Seriously.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.965
Oh, yeah. Of course.
No, thank you, really.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.334
And here's Chewy's
portrait hanging on my wall.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.072
Our next bride Monique's
family wasn't surprised at all

25:42.074 --> 25:45.309
that every dress was
boring to this blingy bride.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.979
I don't think it's enough
blingy up here for her.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.049
Randy, my family
calls me boujetta.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.084
Boujetta, what does that mean?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.386
[Monique]
<i>Very over the top.</i>

25:55.388 --> 25:58.322
Don't ask me how to
spell it, Randy. I don't know.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.324
[all laughing]

26:00.326 --> 26:03.994
Dress after dress was
discarded by our "boujetta,"

26:03.996 --> 26:06.230
but she did eventually
say yes to one,

26:06.232 --> 26:08.766
and it wasn't what
anyone expected.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.101
[Monique] <i>We've been
here for a couple hours now.</i>

26:11.103 --> 26:13.637
My family has only
seen one dress.

26:15.173 --> 26:18.075
So this one, I'm not in
love with the V, of course.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.011
This one, I don't
particularly love

26:21.013 --> 26:22.413
the heaviness of the material.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.781
Ha!

26:23.783 --> 26:25.282
<i>[Monique] I think
I stumped Mindy.</i>

26:25.284 --> 26:28.385
There's not one dress
that I like.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.522
- Wait, let me ask you this.
- [Monique] Okay.

26:31.524 --> 26:32.890
That first dress
that we tried on...

26:32.892 --> 26:34.325
- Mm-hmm.
- You're not--

26:34.327 --> 26:36.393
I can see it in your
face you're not a fan.

26:36.395 --> 26:39.330
I think it's the V that's
just throwing me off,

26:39.332 --> 26:42.266
and I can't envision it
being closed.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.834
<i>[Mindy] Aside from the plunge,</i>

26:43.836 --> 26:45.669
<i>imagine that
the plunge isn't there.</i>

26:45.671 --> 26:47.905
<i>Imagine that we add a
beautiful off-the-shoulder strap.</i>

26:47.907 --> 26:49.039
[Monique] Mm-hmm.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.141
Is there anything about
that that you don't like?

26:51.143 --> 26:53.077
No.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.446
I don't want to think
of a reality of Monique

26:55.448 --> 26:58.248
<i>leaving Kleinfeld
without a gown,</i>

26:58.250 --> 27:00.784
<i>A, because her
wedding's in three months</i>

27:00.786 --> 27:02.319
<i>and B, she's at Kleinfeld.</i>

27:02.321 --> 27:04.288
<i>And it's all about envisioning</i>

27:04.290 --> 27:06.056
<i>that closing of
the neckline for her</i>

27:06.058 --> 27:08.058
<i>and the off-the-shoulder straps.</i>

27:08.060 --> 27:12.930
<i>F I can make that realization
in her head a reality,</i>

27:12.932 --> 27:15.199
hopefully, we have a winner.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.802
This dress used
to have a plunge,

27:18.804 --> 27:21.972
we kind of
make-shifted it a little bit.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.674
Monique, tell me
what you're feeling?

27:23.676 --> 27:25.376
Um...

27:25.378 --> 27:26.343
I love...

27:26.345 --> 27:28.112
I mean, the way it's modified,

27:28.114 --> 27:29.246
I actually love the dress.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.015
Oh!

27:31.017 --> 27:33.851
[Monique] <i>This dress
checks every box for me.</i>

27:33.853 --> 27:38.155
I love, love, love
the off-the-shoulder.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.626
<i>I love how nice the
sweetheart looks in the front.</i>

27:42.628 --> 27:44.628
<i>I love the shape of the dress.</i>

27:44.630 --> 27:46.363
<i>And I'm loving the bling.</i>

27:47.699 --> 27:49.166
I love it.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.968
So, this was the first
dress that she had tried on

27:50.970 --> 27:52.636
that we did not come out in.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.872
Wait a minute, so we
just spent four hours

27:54.874 --> 27:56.040
and it was the first dress?

27:56.042 --> 27:58.108
[all laughing]

27:58.110 --> 28:01.311
Monique's story proves
that one small change

28:01.313 --> 28:03.814
can sometimes
make a big difference,

28:03.816 --> 28:05.649
so please trust
your consultants.

28:05.651 --> 28:06.984
You know, sometimes
you can add a belt,

28:06.986 --> 28:08.218
<i>which adds a little bling.</i>

28:08.220 --> 28:10.921
<i>A little tool around the
arms can add romance,</i>

28:10.923 --> 28:13.657
but I'm still shocked that
Monique made such a turnaround,

28:13.659 --> 28:16.960
and the surprises kept
coming in this appointment.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.997
- Oh, my!
- These are from your fiance.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.633
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.968
Beautiful.

28:26.237 --> 28:29.973
[sniffles] Aw, babe.
You're so cute.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.241
That's beautiful.

28:31.243 --> 28:34.211
Well, Randy, I think we have
a question we have to ask her.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.480
- Are you familiar with this question?
- [Monique] I am.

28:36.482 --> 28:41.051
[all] Monique, are you
saying yes to the dress?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.088
- Yes.
- Yay!

28:44.090 --> 28:45.255
[all cheering]

28:46.191 --> 28:47.558
Yes!

28:50.295 --> 28:53.430
It's definitely a
boujetta dress. [laughs]

28:59.904 --> 29:01.305
<i>[Randy] Shopping
for a wedding dress</i>

29:01.307 --> 29:03.974
can bring out some
unexpected emotions.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.476
I think this is my dress.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.544
I can't control it.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.313
[crying]

29:19.124 --> 29:21.024
Shopping for a wedding
dress can bring out

29:21.026 --> 29:23.026
some unexpected emotions.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.162
Ooh. Well, tickle me
pink and call me Rhonda.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.163
[laughs]

29:26.165 --> 29:28.332
Don't cry. Lord.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.668
- Oh, my Lord.
- Where are the tissues?

29:31.670 --> 29:34.004
And there goes...
What is happening?

29:34.006 --> 29:35.239
That's my dress.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.107
I think that's my dress.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.410
I think I'm gonna
start to cry like...

29:41.312 --> 29:43.046
Like I think this is my dress.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.584
I can't control it.

29:47.586 --> 29:51.288
If this is how I'm feeling
right now, this has to be it.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.259
Alex came to Kleinfeld for the
black goth dress of her dreams.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.360
So, she was a little stunned

29:56.362 --> 30:00.130
when this sweet, retro
number brought her to tears.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.267
Oh... Okay, if I try
this on and it's not...

30:03.269 --> 30:06.003
We hyped it up, then you're
going to be like... wah-wah.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.738
I want it. I just
want to put it on.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.239
Okay, can I see it

30:09.241 --> 30:12.409
So, I've never had a
bride get emotional like this

30:12.411 --> 30:14.645
before she's even
been in the dress,

30:14.647 --> 30:16.647
so I'm getting
a little bit nervous

30:16.649 --> 30:18.916
<i>because I hope that
when she steps in it,</i>

30:18.918 --> 30:20.551
<i>she still feels the same way.</i>

30:21.886 --> 30:23.053
[Alex sniffles]

30:23.288 --> 30:24.688
- You look so beautiful in this.
- Why am I doing this?

30:24.690 --> 30:26.890
Aww.

30:26.892 --> 30:30.961
Like, I can't put my
finger on it, but it's right.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.330
And I didn't think a dress
could make you feel that way,

30:33.332 --> 30:34.898
But it can.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.099
This is my dress.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.534
- [Krissy] You feel it?
- Yeah.

30:38.169 --> 30:42.139
I'm feeling...
everything.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.009
It's just a dress, like,
what is happening to me?

30:46.011 --> 30:47.845
<i>It's not just a dress.</i>

30:47.847 --> 30:50.013
<i>You're marrying
the love of your life.</i>

30:50.015 --> 30:51.715
<i>You can't put it into words.</i>

30:51.717 --> 30:54.017
<i>That dress, it's magic.</i>

30:54.019 --> 30:55.919
[Krissy] It's the veil.
The veil makes it real.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.454
It's a...

30:57.989 --> 30:59.590
- It's immediate...
- Yes.

31:01.326 --> 31:04.027
- [Alex] Wow!
- [Krissy] Oh, my God, Alex.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.963
This is absolutely stunning.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.098
You're a picture perfect bride.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.466
[Alex] Thank you.

31:09.468 --> 31:14.238
[all] Alex, are you
saying yes to the dress?

31:14.939 --> 31:17.374
- Hell, yes.
- [all cheering]

31:19.777 --> 31:22.479
<i>[Alex] It's everything
that they said it would be.</i>

31:22.481 --> 31:24.348
<i>And as soon as
I saw that dress...</i>

31:25.817 --> 31:26.683
game over.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.853
<i>That was it.
That was my dress.</i>

31:29.855 --> 31:33.790
<i>I'm a little shocked at what I
picked out, but it's, it's perfect.</i>

31:33.792 --> 31:36.493
- It's perfect. It's perfect.
- It's perfect.

31:38.863 --> 31:41.465
<i>[Randy] Alex ended up with
something totally different</i>

31:41.467 --> 31:42.799
than what she came in for,

31:42.801 --> 31:44.067
which actually happens a lot.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.036
Our next bride, Amanda,

31:46.038 --> 31:50.140
had her heart set on a
specific dress, too, one of mine.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.175
All right, Amanda, and I have...

31:52.177 --> 31:53.911
- [exclaims]
- the Anastasia dress.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.978
[Amanda] Gorgeous!

31:54.980 --> 31:56.280
Oh, my goodness.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.049
This is the one
that you had seen.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.151
- A big ball gown, lots of lace.
- Yes! Yes!

32:01.153 --> 32:03.353
Oh, my goodness.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.289
It's screaming my name.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.024
I'm here for you.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.927
She'd been dreaming
of my Anastasia gown,

32:09.929 --> 32:11.962
<i>but when she finally got it on,</i>

32:11.964 --> 32:14.298
things took a bit of
a surprising turn.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.299
Does that feel okay?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.634
This feels gorgeous.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.038
- It looks incredible on you.
- It does.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.906
I'm just not a fan of
this part right here.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.141
Not a fan?

32:24.143 --> 32:25.809
[Amanda whispers] I'm
not liking it that much.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.377
[Kelsey] Oh, no!

32:27.379 --> 32:28.779
I'm going to cry
because I love ball gowns

32:28.781 --> 32:31.248
and it's not fitting me.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.217
[exhales] I thought I was going
to cry when I went in this dress.

32:34.219 --> 32:35.652
- [Kelsey] Okay.
- I'm a little disappointed

32:35.654 --> 32:36.987
that it's not making me cry.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.156
- Okay.
- I want to cry and I'm not crying.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.824
I mean, I've stared at
this dress for months.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.226
I feel like I'm being swallowed.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.496
It's not sitting in the
places I thought it would sit.

32:48.299 --> 32:52.002
So, this is the Anastasia dress.

32:53.838 --> 32:55.539
Oh, my God, Amanda.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.441
It has a really long train.

32:58.242 --> 32:59.609
So, how do you feel?

33:00.945 --> 33:02.179
Um...

33:03.648 --> 33:05.415
I, I love it,

33:05.417 --> 33:07.384
but I don't feel like
it's doing me justice

33:07.386 --> 33:09.853
because it's so big.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.088
[Randy]
<i>In a shocking twist,</i>

33:11.090 --> 33:13.290
it looked like Amanda
was going to say yes

33:13.292 --> 33:15.125
to something totally opposite.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.927
Surprise.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.362
That is beautiful.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.230
I love this dress so much.

33:20.232 --> 33:24.368
I was not expecting
to like this fit.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.337
But she wasn't ready to give
up on ball gowns quite yet.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.845
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.047
I know.
I love it so much.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.916
[Michelle] Oh, my God.
That is gorgeous.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.952
[Kelsey] So, this is the
other Randy ball gown.

33:41.954 --> 33:43.487
[Jodie] I love that.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.355
I love this so much.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.525
Because it's tight on top
and then it flares like...

33:48.527 --> 33:49.826
Oh, wow, Amanda.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.028
- It's so beautiful.
- I know.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.330
The top of this dress
is everything.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.732
I love how it goes
up the neck right here.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.300
[Michelle] And if it's
going to be low like that,

33:57.302 --> 33:59.369
- it still shows your smallness.
- [Amanda] Yeah.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.204
<i>[Randy] You said
you wanted extra.</i>

34:01.206 --> 34:03.273
This is definitely extra.

34:03.275 --> 34:07.177
I knew as soon as she was
walking out, that was the dress.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.378
[Jodie] Good to see her happy.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.413
[both] Yes.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.549
- Oh, my goodness.
- [laughs]

34:13.484 --> 34:15.218
This is my dress.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.454
Aww.

34:18.990 --> 34:21.825
- It's gorgeous.
- [Amanda] I love it so much.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.162
Oh, my God, Raymond's
going to love me in this dress.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.865
I'm so ready. Ask me the
question already! [laughs]

34:28.867 --> 34:34.037
[both] Amanda, are you
saying yes to the dress?

34:34.039 --> 34:36.640
I'm saying yes to my
Randy Fenoli dress.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.476
- [all] Yay!
- [all cheering]

34:50.822 --> 34:53.056
Oh, yes.
It's so pretty

34:54.292 --> 34:56.827
In one of the sweetest
moments of the season,

34:56.829 --> 34:59.963
Prashanthi's soon to be
brother-in-law, bowled everyone over

34:59.965 --> 35:02.032
with this burst of emotion

35:02.034 --> 35:03.667
that I don't think
anyone saw coming.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.302
- Oh.
- [gasps] She's coming.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.070
She's coming.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.577
- [Michael] Oh.
- Oh, wow!

35:17.048 --> 35:18.181
That's gorgeous.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.085
I love the sparkle.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.154
- I think, I think this is perfect, right?
- It's beautiful.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.255
Look how happy she looks.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.224
I am.
I'm very, very happy.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.326
Steven's going to flip out.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.896
He's going to see
her finally in a dress.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.398
That moment,
you only get one of.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.734
Oh, Mike is crying.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.035
No, 'cause...
Come on.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.904
Steven's going to see no
matter what dress you buy.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.940
When you see him look at
you the way I looked at my wife...

35:43.942 --> 35:47.210
[woman] Oh, Mike,
everyone's so emotional.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.279
- Michael's crying already.
- Aw, Michael,

35:49.281 --> 35:51.314
- you're so sweet.
- You guys all suck.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.782
[all laugh]

35:52.784 --> 35:54.584
Not you, Randy.
Not you.

35:56.621 --> 35:58.188
[Prashanthi]
<i>I feel like royalty.</i>

35:58.789 --> 36:01.658
It is so gorgeous.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.160
<i>I'm feeling all tingly.</i>

36:03.162 --> 36:06.196
<i>And... it's it.</i>

36:06.464 --> 36:08.165
<i>This is it.</i>

36:08.167 --> 36:10.200
The moment.
I know it.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.903
Prashanthi...

36:12.905 --> 36:15.505
[all] ...are you saying
yes to the dress?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.107
I'm saying yes to the dress.

36:17.109 --> 36:18.074
[all cheering]

36:18.076 --> 36:20.477
Congratulations!

36:21.312 --> 36:24.080
- [Mike] You look beautiful.
- [Prashanthi] Thank you.

36:25.049 --> 36:28.485
What would you say your
favorite surprise has been

36:28.487 --> 36:29.853
not even just of this season,

36:29.855 --> 36:31.955
but ever on the show?

36:31.957 --> 36:32.923
Oh, gosh.
There are so many.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.157
Um...

36:43.034 --> 36:46.503
We've definitely had a lot of
surprising moments recently.

36:46.505 --> 36:50.840
But there's one surprise that
was an entire season in the making.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.608
Take a look.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.444
Ronnie Rothstein.

36:54.446 --> 36:57.113
Randy Fenoli,
how's the renovation?

36:57.115 --> 36:58.281
[metal clanking]

36:58.283 --> 37:01.351
[Randy exclaims] Uh-oh.
Let me move this. Yeah.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.287
<i>Ah, you know, it's renovations,</i>

37:04.289 --> 37:06.423
<i>everything takes twice as long.</i>

37:06.425 --> 37:07.991
I really wish I was
there in person

37:07.993 --> 37:10.227
to show the dresses
to all the consultants.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.962
I wish you were, too.

37:11.964 --> 37:14.497
Yeah, let me move out here
so I can hear you actually.

37:14.499 --> 37:15.932
We want you back in New York.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.201
Everybody wants you
here. You're missed.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.337
I was hoping to see
if I could book

37:20.339 --> 37:21.905
a trunk show possibly
with the new collection.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.807
Oh, my God, I love that.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.275
[Randy] <i>After being
stuck at home for a year,</i>

37:25.277 --> 37:27.844
finally, the time is right.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.247
I have to say, I couldn't
wait to get back to New York

37:30.249 --> 37:32.482
and surprise
everyone at Kleinfeld.

37:40.958 --> 37:42.892
Boo-boo, here you go.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.061
Ah. Yeah, look.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.030
Look at this, Chewy,
it's all different.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.032
- Yeah.
- [Dorothy] Chewy.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.167
- [Ronnie] Chewy.
- [Dorothy] What are you doing here, Chewy?

37:51.169 --> 37:52.802
- Chewy.
- Where's Randy?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.938
- If Chewy's here, Randy's here.
- [Randy] Who's that?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.641
- Oh, Randy.
- Oh, Dorothy.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.875
[all laughing]

37:58.877 --> 38:00.944
I feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.212
- You haven't.
- I love you.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.580
You haven't changed a bit.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.982
I'm out of COVID jail.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.250
Ronnie, how are you doing?

38:07.252 --> 38:09.119
[Ronnie] You're back.
You're back.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.521
Mindy, look who's here.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.225
Hey, my Mindilicious.
[laughs]

38:15.227 --> 38:17.761
[Mindy] So nice to see you
not on a screen anymore.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.129
Looking at the ceiling
and the floor.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.398
By the way, he came
with new gorgeous dresses.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.233
- Yes.
- He came with Chewy.

38:23.235 --> 38:25.135
It is so amazing to be back,

38:25.137 --> 38:26.336
to be able to hug people,

38:26.338 --> 38:28.405
to be able to do
what I love in person,

38:28.407 --> 38:29.639
to be out of the house.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.974
Do you have your
roller skates on?

38:30.976 --> 38:32.442
- Of course, I'm ready.
- We're booked solid.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.110
- I'm ready, baby.
- Listen to me.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.145
I'm going to get you set up.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.846
Come on, bring your bag,

38:36.848 --> 38:38.248
and I'm going to take
you in the back. Come on.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.483
- Where's Chewy?
- Let's do it.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.052
- Come on, Randolph.
- [Randy] Good seeing you.

38:42.054 --> 38:43.153
Where's chewy?

38:43.155 --> 38:45.388
He's probably out in the
lobby greeting people.

38:45.390 --> 38:48.191
- [Dorothy] Yay, I'm so happy you're here.
- [Randy] Me, too.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.293
It feels so good to be back.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.062
Rack and roll.

38:52.064 --> 38:54.764
But I'm also glad that I was
able to spend time with my mom

38:54.766 --> 38:57.100
<i>and work on my house.</i>

38:57.102 --> 39:00.136
Wait, Randy, we need to
see these house renovations

39:00.138 --> 39:02.205
that kept you away
from us for so long.

39:02.207 --> 39:03.973
Come here.
Let me show you.

39:05.209 --> 39:07.010
I'll show you.
Hang on.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.113
<i>And everybody that walks in,</i>

39:10.115 --> 39:12.182
<i>- they go crazy with that lighting...
- [Daniela] Wow!</i>

39:12.184 --> 39:14.117
<i>[Randy] And you see
my quartzite.</i>

39:14.119 --> 39:16.319
<i>[Daniela] Chewy is
front and center.</i>

39:16.321 --> 39:17.554
[Randy laughing]

39:19.223 --> 39:20.323
<i>[Randy] So, here's my bathroom.</i>

39:20.325 --> 39:21.591
<i>[Daniela] Wow.</i>

39:21.593 --> 39:23.526
<i>- [Randy] The shower.
- [Daniela] Oh, my gosh!</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:26.329
Honestly, I think that your
bathroom is the size of my apartment.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.130
[laughs]

39:27.132 --> 39:29.199
I know.
I've lived in New York.

39:30.501 --> 39:34.604
We've definitely had some fun
and surprising moments this season.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.839
So many.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.109
What would you say your
favorite surprise has been,

39:39.111 --> 39:40.310
not even just of this season,

39:40.312 --> 39:42.278
but ever on the show?

39:42.280 --> 39:45.014
Oh, gosh. There
are so many. Um...

39:45.016 --> 39:48.084
I think my most
favorite surprise

39:48.086 --> 39:51.988
would have been Alicia, our
military bride that I ambushed.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.924
- Hello, beautiful.
- [all cheering]

39:54.926 --> 39:56.126
How are you?

39:56.128 --> 40:00.730
You have truly gone above
and beyond for our country

40:00.732 --> 40:02.532
and for everything you've done.

40:02.534 --> 40:06.169
So, we want to go above
and beyond today for you,

40:06.171 --> 40:08.071
and I want to
personally give you

40:08.073 --> 40:10.240
a VIP experience at Kleinfeld.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.876
Oh, my God, who did this?

40:12.878 --> 40:15.412
- Oh, my God!
- This is your day, baby.

40:15.414 --> 40:19.282
- How much is it?
- Uh, it's $6,100.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.383
You know what?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.252
[softly] Mm-hm.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.053
Don't worry about
the price today.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.556
[crying]
Oh, my God!

40:28.325 --> 40:30.427
I love it.
Oh, my God.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.862
Oh, my God.

40:32.864 --> 40:36.199
It is more than I ever
dreamed of, I promise you.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.168
[exclaims]

40:38.170 --> 40:41.471
Alicia, are you saying
yes to the dress?

40:43.073 --> 40:44.941
I'm saying yes to this dress.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.476
[all cheering]

40:47.545 --> 40:48.778
So, then I'd have to say

40:48.780 --> 40:51.781
that my other
favorite surprise was,

40:51.783 --> 40:55.552
when I brought my mom up to
New York City for her birthday.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.953
- Now, my mom--
- So sweet.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.489
Yeah. My mom rides
in a motorcycle group,

40:59.491 --> 41:01.458
so I found a
motorcycle group here

41:01.460 --> 41:04.060
and took her on the
back of a motorcycle

41:04.062 --> 41:05.261
up the West Side Highway.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.268
Well, there's my Harley,

41:12.270 --> 41:13.937
Right there is my Harley.

41:13.939 --> 41:16.272
- [Randy] Is that what you ride?
- Yeah.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.774
Happy birthday.
I'm Joe Pascas,

41:17.776 --> 41:19.342
second officer, one of
the New York Chapters.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.145
Happy birthday, and
I'm your escort to lunch.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.447
- Oh, I get to ride on the motorcycle?
- Yes, ma'am.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.516
- Were you expecting this?
- No.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.386
I'm waiting for you.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.056
- Watch your back.
- Pink glasses as well?

41:33.058 --> 41:34.958
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, my God!

41:35.493 --> 41:37.660
Okay, take good care of my mom.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.031
And there she goes.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.903
She's having a blast.
[laughs]

41:46.905 --> 41:49.105
I wanted her to have
a birthday to remember.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.340
<i>[Jeanette] Thank you
for everything.</i>

41:50.342 --> 41:52.408
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.078
That was real sweet of you.

41:56.213 --> 41:59.582
This is the way the
Fenolis roll. [laughs]

42:00.918 --> 42:01.918
She still talks about that.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.854
- She had-- - The most
unexpected biker babe.

42:04.856 --> 42:08.057
And she had no idea this was
happening. No clue whatsoever.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.326
- This was fun, right?
- I enjoyed myself.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.794
Let's get you ready.

42:11.796 --> 42:15.965
I actually have
a big surprise for you.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.868
- [Randy] What?
- [Daniela] I changed my dress.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.204
[Randy] What?
Wait a minute. What?

42:21.206 --> 42:23.072
<i>You know my rule, once
you say yes to the dress,</i>

42:23.074 --> 42:24.407
<i>you can't put on another one.</i>

42:24.409 --> 42:25.909
Once you find the right guy,

42:25.911 --> 42:27.610
you don't go to the singles bar.

42:27.612 --> 42:29.279
<i>[Daniela] I went
to the singles bar.</i>
