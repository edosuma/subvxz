Matthew, you check under the bed.
Todd, come with me.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.400
We can't afford to
miss one single piece.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.633
Keep looking.
We've gotta find him.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.300
Is that all of it?
All but the King of Karlsville.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.300
But how do we know
if that's Karl?

18:07.266 --> 18:08.700
Looks like his clothes.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.333
Plus, we checked
every inch of that room.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.333
I just wish that we could be sure.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.233
Look. You see there?

18:21.233 --> 18:25.700
- That's Karl's head.
- Yeah, it-- It's gotta be.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.700
Are you sure?

18:28.700 --> 18:30.200
It better be.

18:33.700 --> 18:37.466
Next time, pick on
someone your own size.

18:42.466 --> 18:45.133
