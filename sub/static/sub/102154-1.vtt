M_I_SForEver

00:35.702 --> 00:39.036
So, how's your temper lately?

00:41.141 --> 00:43.303
- You have any recent outbursts?
- No.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.436
What about stress?

00:46.546 --> 00:48.207
Only when I come in here.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.748
Look, I'm trying to make this
as painless as possible.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.080
And may I also remind you
that these evaluations

00:57.190 --> 00:58.954
are part of your parole requirements.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.930
Now, are you going
to answer the questions,

01:05.031 --> 01:08.592
or do I have to write down that you are
being uncooperative in my report?

01:08.701 --> 01:09.668
Right. Ahem.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.863
Now, let's get back to your personal life.
What's going on there?

01:14.874 --> 01:16.103
Nothing.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.305
- And Mia, how's she doing?
- She's fine, I guess.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.746
What's she up to?

01:23.817 --> 01:27.651
Just usual stuff, you know?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.415
No, I don't know.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.330
Hey, you mind not leaving
your ashes in front of my door?

02:19.105 --> 02:20.834
Fucking unbelievable.

02:30.783 --> 02:31.841
Hey!

02:34.654 --> 02:36.748
- Ethan, 'sup?
- Oh, hey, man.

02:37.924 --> 02:38.914
What the hell is going on?

02:40.493 --> 02:43.656
Uh, this is my boyfriend Lars.
Lars, my brother Ethan.

02:43.763 --> 02:44.855
How's it going, man?

02:44.964 --> 02:46.489
Get your drugs
and get the fuck out of here!

02:46.599 --> 02:47.794
What, are you serious, bro?

02:47.867 --> 02:49.835
- Ethan, don't be a dick.
- Now!

02:49.903 --> 02:51.393
What the fuck's your problem, man?

02:51.504 --> 02:52.972
You're my fuckin' problem, man.

02:53.039 --> 02:57.476
Okay, let's just calm down.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.969
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?!

03:01.047 --> 03:02.879
- Easy, man!
- What the fuck, bro?

03:02.982 --> 03:04.507
Get your shit and get the fuck outta here!

03:05.518 --> 03:06.679
Stop.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.183
The same goes for you, ladies.
Get the fuck outta here!

03:12.292 --> 03:13.726
- Okay.
- Jeez!

03:13.826 --> 03:15.817
You don't have to be an asshole about it.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.556
Bye, guys. Sorry.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.564
Bye, Mia.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.229
I don't want them here. I don't want them
doing their drugs here!

03:25.338 --> 03:27.272
Fucking relax, it's not a big deal.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.603
Mia, you don't need to be hanging around
with trash like that.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.041
You're not even 18.
I mean, how old are they?

03:32.111 --> 03:34.239
- You're not my fucking father.
- Yeah, thank God for that.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.964
Fuck it.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.331
...your responsibility to make
sure the hotel reservations were set.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.909
Don't blame this on me!

04:36.976 --> 04:41.379
All you do is text God only knows
on that cell phone all day long!

05:09.309 --> 05:10.834
Go! Go! Go!

05:12.178 --> 05:14.442
I think I'm going to be sick.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.107
Don't throw up in my car.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.514
She's not going to throw up
in your stupid car.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.114
Ew.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.037
- You Ethan?
- Yeah.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.638
Kaden?

06:26.552 --> 06:30.887
Ethan, I need to get to 37 Mission,
downtown. How long will it take you?

06:30.957 --> 06:33.255
This time of night, about 30 minutes.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.178
Where you going?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.240
This is a shortcut to the 110.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.562
Well, you keep pretty late hours.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.568
Yeah, I got insomnia.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.103
Yeah, I know all about that.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.072
What do you do?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.375
Need some water?

07:34.921 --> 07:36.082
I lend people money.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.651
Well, now I know where to for a loan, huh?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.523
You seem like a nice guy.

07:41.627 --> 07:47.122
If I was you, I would...
I'd-I'd go to somebody else.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.792
You're not much of a salesman.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.100
Just looking after your health.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.402
How we doing on time?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.274
Maybe another ten, maybe less.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.477
You looking for any full-time work?

08:01.547 --> 08:02.537
This is it.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.510
I work when I want.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.885
My mom gave me this car, so, easy money.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.785
Hey, whatever rocks your boat.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.198
All right, we're here.

08:25.304 --> 08:26.863
All right, let's do it.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.577
Ah, here, take this.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.806
Thanks, man. Well, you have my number.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.928
Hey, Frankie.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.840
Ethan, sit, please.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.914
What's going on?

09:11.017 --> 09:12.382
What do you mean?

09:12.485 --> 09:16.183
Well, got some negative reviews
about you tonight.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.654
One girl says, uh...

09:17.723 --> 09:19.191
she some wrote comments

09:19.258 --> 09:22.922
that you intentionally took
an extra-long route

09:23.029 --> 09:24.827
so to screw her outta some money. Hm.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.697
No, I took a shortcut
to get her there faster.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.532
Besides, you know the fee
is destination-based,

09:30.603 --> 09:32.093
so what does that matter?

09:33.339 --> 09:36.036
So you didn't maybe drive her
somewhere private,

09:36.108 --> 09:38.543
so you could, you know,
score up a little somethin'?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.101
- No.
- No?

09:40.212 --> 09:42.237
I mean, I know you lowlifes
like to hit on all the girls,

09:42.315 --> 09:45.876
but that cultural shit,
that doesn't work here.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.283
What are you trying to say?

09:48.387 --> 09:49.877
Here's another report.

09:51.057 --> 09:56.496
Woman claims that you were sexually
harassing her and her friends.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.893
She make that up?

09:57.964 --> 10:00.934
She was drinking with her friends
and she threw up in the back of my car,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.263
and I had to clean up the mess.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.803
Well, be that as it may,

10:03.903 --> 10:07.931
I'm still gonna have to follow protocol

10:08.040 --> 10:10.407
and run this by corporate.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.446
Wait, are you firing me?

10:13.546 --> 10:16.038
No, I'm suspending you.

10:17.249 --> 10:18.910
Great.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.249
Now, I'll let you know
when it's all cleared up.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.482
Well, can I get paid now?

10:23.589 --> 10:26.217
You owe me over ten grand.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.727
I cannot pay you.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.320
I cannot pay you
until this whole thing blows over.

10:31.430 --> 10:34.889
That is company policy. I'm sorry.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.935
Mia?

10:48.014 --> 10:49.675
What, Ethan? I gotta go to the bathroom.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.773
- Dinner's about ready.
- Okay, can I pee first?

10:58.391 --> 10:59.483
Shit.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.108
Hey, wait a second.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.839
Come on, let's sit at the table for once.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.777
Why?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.440
Pretend we're a family.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.006
<i>¿Qué?</i>

11:25.117 --> 11:26.676
Just give it a shot.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.652
This is stupid, I don't want...

11:28.721 --> 11:30.155
Have a seat.

11:32.124 --> 11:33.523
<i>Por favor.</i>

11:42.735 --> 11:44.931
- You okay?
- Fine.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.339
Hey, what happened to your ring?

11:49.909 --> 11:51.035
I lost it.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.669
You lost Mom's ring? Are you serious?

11:52.745 --> 11:54.907
It's not a big deal.
I'm sure it's around somewhere.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.209
So...

11:59.618 --> 12:02.451
- how's school?
- School is school.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.080
- But you're going?
- Duh.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.116
That's funny, 'cause I got
a letter from them

12:07.226 --> 12:09.285
saying how you've been absent for weeks.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.556
It's just not my thing.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.103
You know what happens
if you stop going, right?

12:18.204 --> 12:20.070
They could take you away
and put you in a foster home.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.072
Are you in some kind of trouble?

12:23.609 --> 12:26.874
No. No.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.711
It... I just don't see
the point much in going.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.546
I mean, you never finished.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.585
Yeah, and that was
the mistake that <i>I</i> made.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.918
It's just not for me.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.386
Oh, so what then?

12:37.456 --> 12:39.390
You just hang out
and you get high with Lars?

12:39.458 --> 12:42.450
- I'm telling you, you don't need him.
- This is how it starts.

12:42.561 --> 12:43.892
I've seen the way he treats you.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.453
Will you lay off of him?

12:45.564 --> 12:47.589
You don't see me
sticking my nose in your shit!

12:50.402 --> 12:54.168
- The guy's bad news. He's affecting...
- Fucking drop it!

12:55.341 --> 12:57.503
Jeez, the fuck you want from me?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.601
I want you to use
your fucking brain for once.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.112
Yeah, this coming
from a fucking cab driver.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.614
Don't you disrespect me like that.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.412
I do that job and pay the bills
so you can go to school!

13:05.484 --> 13:08.351
- You think Mom would just let you...
- You're not Mom!

13:08.454 --> 13:09.785
You're not my fucking father!

13:09.855 --> 13:12.620
You're not even my full fucking brother,
so stop fucking acting like it!

13:12.725 --> 13:14.591
But I'm still your guardian, huh?

13:14.660 --> 13:16.389
You'd be in a foster home
if it wasn't for me!

13:16.462 --> 13:17.987
Yeah, but at least I wouldn't
have to listen to your shit!

13:18.097 --> 13:20.998
Yeah, you keep it up, and you see how far
that mouth of yours will get you, huh?

13:38.918 --> 13:41.410
I see you're still leaving
your cigarette ashes everywhere.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.820
And you're still being loud
as fuck in there.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.293
Well, fun chatting with you, as always.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.792
She'll grow out of it, you know.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.457
What?

13:56.535 --> 13:58.196
Your daughter.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.238
She'll grow out of it at some point.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.398
Oh, she's my sister.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.810
Makes sense why you guys argue so much.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.506
Yeah, well, I guess
I better get back inside.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.481
Yep. Later.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.502
Shit.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.176
I'm gonna go try and talk to Dante.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.412
Okay.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.117
Mia! Finally!

15:24.223 --> 15:25.918
- You made it!
- Hi.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.871
You still sticking that shit
up your nose?

15:54.920 --> 15:59.790
Goddamnit,
I went off those fuckin' painkillers.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.586
Fuck up my head.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.440
You're fucking up, Dante.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.940
You know that.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.638
Listen, Mr. Storme.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.771
- How this is...
- Listen, you little weasel,

16:22.848 --> 16:24.247
we have heard everything you've been...

16:24.316 --> 16:25.806
- Fuck you, Jan!
- Oh, fuck me?

16:25.918 --> 16:29.513
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

16:59.084 --> 17:00.643
This is your last chance.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.646
Look at me. You understand me, Dante?

17:08.727 --> 17:10.092
You understand me?

17:20.271 --> 17:25.073
No more... No more product
for this... cocksucker.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.699
Fucker!

17:48.767 --> 17:50.565
You're lucky I don't shoot
your fucking ass!

17:50.669 --> 17:51.932
Shoot your ass!

17:55.741 --> 17:56.606
Okay.

18:10.956 --> 18:12.583
The fuck do you want?

18:14.793 --> 18:16.386
You got my money?

18:18.630 --> 18:20.120
I got some of it.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.130
Where's your girl?

18:30.309 --> 18:31.777
She's here.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.810
Well, go get her.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.142
The fuck you waiting for?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.158
No, I know, it was...

18:49.261 --> 18:51.389
Dante wants to talk to us, now! Come on!

19:08.814 --> 19:10.282
What've you got for me?

19:14.686 --> 19:16.450
Got some cash...

19:18.157 --> 19:19.147
some phones...

19:22.027 --> 19:23.017
and some jewelry.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.527
The fuck is this?

19:31.803 --> 19:33.669
Okay, put your hand on the table.

19:33.772 --> 19:37.367
- Dante, please...
- Don't make me ask you again!

19:44.683 --> 19:45.673
Hey, you...

19:48.787 --> 19:50.380
I want you to see this.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.014
So pay attention!

19:56.328 --> 19:58.854
Fuck!

19:58.931 --> 20:01.400
Put your hand back on the table!

20:07.372 --> 20:09.500
Lars?

20:11.343 --> 20:13.072
Just so we have an understanding,

20:13.178 --> 20:16.842
I don't give a shit how young you are,
just get me the fucking cash.

20:18.617 --> 20:21.211
Oh, you must be hurting.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.880
Here, try some of this.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.259
Hi.

20:31.263 --> 20:32.594
Mia.

20:32.698 --> 20:33.597
Eth...

20:57.756 --> 21:01.056
Ethan, promise me.

21:02.227 --> 21:03.888
I want Mia to have it.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.630
You give it to her after I'm gone.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.801
You're all she's got left.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.134
Mia, you okay?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.473
Ethan.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.508
You had a bad trip.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.386
Hey, what kind of trouble are you in?

21:33.992 --> 21:35.756
And tell me the truth.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.561
Come on.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.236
I owe some money.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.738
How much?

21:48.607 --> 21:49.631
Tell me.

21:51.176 --> 21:52.575
Mia.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.110
Twenty grand.

21:56.181 --> 21:59.344
What? To who?!

22:00.686 --> 22:04.987
Me and Lars, we were gonna
run away together,

22:05.057 --> 22:07.219
start a new life or something.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.328
But we needed money,

22:10.395 --> 22:13.854
so we ended up borrowing
from this guy, Dante.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.302
It started off as ten grand.

22:21.540 --> 22:26.239
We were basically gonna use it
to start a business or something.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.473
But that never happened.

22:28.547 --> 22:33.348
We... we ended up
spending it all on drugs.

22:33.452 --> 22:36.979
And... then Dante tells us

22:37.055 --> 22:39.114
that he's gonna be charging interest.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.718
And that ten grand went to 12,

22:42.828 --> 22:45.525
then to 15 and now 20.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.664
Who is this Dante?

22:51.336 --> 22:54.533
He works for some big drug lord
or something, I don't know.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.733
And where do I find him?

22:57.809 --> 22:58.867
Why? What are you gonna do?

22:58.977 --> 23:01.139
You let me deal with that.

23:03.582 --> 23:07.018
Ethan, he's dangerous.
I saw him shoot Lars' hand...

23:07.085 --> 23:08.450
Where is he?

23:13.625 --> 23:14.786
Give me my phone back.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.088
I'm gonna call Lars, I'll ask him myself.

23:16.194 --> 23:17.923
He's at the Velvet Room.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.257
What are you doing? Ethan.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.600
You stay here.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.181
Give me my money.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.875
I told you, I can't just
give you your money.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.010
I said, give me my money!
I'm not asking!

23:41.086 --> 23:43.020
All right, Ethan, relax.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.578
I could sue you for not paying me,

23:44.689 --> 23:47.886
but I don't use lawyers
to handle my business.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.256
Relax.

23:51.029 --> 23:51.860
God.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.746
- Where's Dante?
- Downstairs.

24:25.997 --> 24:26.862
Mm.

24:32.504 --> 24:35.030
Yeah, fuck are you?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.069
I'm here for Mia.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.307
- Come again?
- Mia.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.073
Mia, Mia...

24:47.085 --> 24:48.746
Oh, yeah, her.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.845
I don't know where that fuckin' bitch is.

24:51.857 --> 24:52.688
Mm.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.623
Mia's my sister.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.858
Hey, look, man,

25:02.968 --> 25:06.632
your sister and her boyfriend
owe me 20 grand.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.572
It's nothing personal, but they owe.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.042
Yeah, with all the tax you're tacking on,
you're making it impossible for them.

25:13.144 --> 25:16.341
Hey, listen, man, last I checked,
we're living in a capitalist country.

25:16.414 --> 25:19.145
You know it's more Lars
that owes you than her, right?

25:19.217 --> 25:23.415
Fuck, I don't give a shit who it is,
as long as I get my fucking cash.

25:32.998 --> 25:35.933
I got ten grand right here.

25:42.741 --> 25:43.572
Hey.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.141
You take this and she's done.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.181
Yeah, yeah, sure.

25:52.651 --> 25:53.880
Mia's done with everything.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.415
Just so you know, Lars isn't off the hook.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.048
Yeah, good.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.822
Ahem.

26:06.998 --> 26:07.829
Hey...

26:11.770 --> 26:15.468
If you know what's good for you,
you better not show your face here again.

26:36.728 --> 26:37.627
Hey, Lars?

26:37.729 --> 26:39.128
What?

26:45.737 --> 26:47.933
If I see you again, you're dead.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.813
Thanks.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.356
You're welcome.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.973
You know, for as long
as I've known you,

27:55.040 --> 27:57.509
I've never understood
why you like this place so much.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.204
Well, I'm just a creature of habit.

28:01.312 --> 28:04.680
I like simplicity.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.674
So we need to go over the list.

28:06.785 --> 28:11.188
According to Dante, we've got three
this week who are past due.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.882
Ah.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.390
Give me the sugar.

28:14.492 --> 28:15.482
What?

28:16.494 --> 28:18.519
Am I speaking Chinese to you?

28:23.935 --> 28:25.596
Look, I need you
to listen to me, all right?

28:27.272 --> 28:29.934
I know you don't respect
or understand my business.

28:30.041 --> 28:34.911
Jake, I've never liked much
of what you've had to say, okay?

28:36.915 --> 28:39.350
As a matter of fact,
I don't even like you.

28:43.421 --> 28:48.689
Well, you see, the thing is my operation
still gives you half your customers.

28:49.694 --> 28:50.593
Jake...

28:52.664 --> 28:54.223
don't blow...

28:56.367 --> 28:58.893
smoke up my ass.

28:59.003 --> 29:00.528
You do what you gotta do.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.578
- I will.
- Well?

29:14.853 --> 29:16.082
Well, what else?

29:17.088 --> 29:18.749
Just get out of my face.

29:21.993 --> 29:26.430
I need to call and check to see if Dante's
collected those debts for you.

29:26.498 --> 29:32.096
Dante is irrelevant.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.766
- Here you are, dear.
- Oh, you're so good.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.276
I know.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.410
Yeah?

29:43.481 --> 29:44.915
<i>Dante, are any of this...</i>

29:44.983 --> 29:47.247
this week's debts been paid?

29:47.318 --> 29:49.650
Get the fuck off me.

29:49.754 --> 29:50.880
Uh...

29:50.955 --> 29:52.787
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

29:52.891 --> 29:55.724
Um, no.

29:57.662 --> 30:01.997
Well... It's my fault

30:02.100 --> 30:04.159
<i>that I'm stuck
with a piece of shit like you.</i>

30:04.269 --> 30:06.738
Just get the debts paid, okay?

30:10.608 --> 30:12.633
Hey, baby, wanna smoke this joint?

30:30.028 --> 30:31.689
Hello?

30:31.796 --> 30:34.060
<i>Hey, weasel, you know who it is.</i>

30:34.165 --> 30:37.032
<i>I need to collect the information
on the outstanding debtors.</i>

30:37.135 --> 30:41.572
Um, yes, there's Lars. Lars Mitchem.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.074
<i>Lars Mitchem, and the other one?</i>

30:44.175 --> 30:47.008
- Um...
- <i>The other one?</i>

30:48.546 --> 30:50.241
That's-that's it.

30:50.348 --> 30:54.717
<i>No, no, Kaden said
that there was another one.</i>

30:54.819 --> 30:57.880
No. No, no, that's it.

30:57.989 --> 31:02.449
<i>Fine, then you're gonna take
responsibility for it.</i>

31:02.527 --> 31:03.824
<i>It's gonna be your fucking life.</i>

31:05.330 --> 31:08.630
Oh, wait, um, I-I made a mistake.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.566
There is a second one.

31:10.668 --> 31:11.863
<i>Name?</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:14.464
Mia.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.029
<i>Last name?</i>

31:17.041 --> 31:19.703
Locke. Mia Locke.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.371
<i>Have a great fucking day.</i>

31:32.423 --> 31:34.619
Looks like you
beat me out here this time.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.928
Yeah, I guess so.

31:41.966 --> 31:47.268
So, uh, can I bum a cigarette?
I'm all out.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.763
Yeah.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.010
Thanks.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.847
I never caught your name.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.785
You never asked.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.913
Well, I'm asking now.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.219
Chloe.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.693
Chloe?

32:10.728 --> 32:12.526
I'm Ethan.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.361
I didn't ask.

32:17.201 --> 32:21.104
Just fucking with you.
Nice to meet you.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.400
Yeah.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.532
Oh, shit, I gotta get back inside.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.008
I'm making dinner.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.772
- What're you making?
- Spaghetti.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.148
Well, if I'm being honest,

32:32.250 --> 32:34.742
it's really the only thing
I know how to make.

32:34.819 --> 32:38.619
Hm, well, enjoy.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.853
Hey, why don't you maybe
come join us for dinner?

32:43.328 --> 32:46.457
Thank you. I'm cool, though.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.932
No, it'll be fine. Come on.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.196
- All right.
- Come on.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.016
Oh, that's good, thank you.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.661
I, uh... I like your choker.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.027
Thanks.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.793
Yeah, she never seems to take it off.

33:24.602 --> 33:26.969
- So, Chloe, is it?
- Mm-hmm.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.231
So you're our neighbor, huh?

33:30.541 --> 33:33.374
Yeah, that's right.
I've seen you around.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.171
Cool. I haven't seen <i>you</i> around.

33:40.318 --> 33:43.549
Mia here tends to be
a little absent-minded.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.418
You're one to talk.

33:46.991 --> 33:50.859
No, it's cool. I can handle
a dis here and there.

33:52.096 --> 33:54.656
So how old are you, sweetie?

33:54.732 --> 33:56.222
Twenty.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.769
- You're 16.
- Twenty.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.531
She's 16.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.032
How old are you again?

34:08.846 --> 34:11.474
Very nice. Um...

34:11.549 --> 34:15.007
How awesome is it to have
such a cool brother look after you?

34:15.085 --> 34:18.021
Half-brother, and he thinks
he's cooler than he is.

34:21.359 --> 34:25.489
- So your parents live near here?
- They're dead.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.431
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Why? Did you kill them?

34:29.534 --> 34:30.728
Mia.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.295
I think Ethan's dad's still alive...

34:34.405 --> 34:36.134
Stop.

34:37.442 --> 34:38.909
English, please, for our guest.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.976
Mm, you must like her.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.949
Stop trying to embarrass me.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.442
Mia!

34:50.221 --> 34:52.656
I was just asking my brother
if he was treating you well.

35:01.732 --> 35:05.066
Busted! Ethan, she's a keeper. I like her.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.966
Mia here really loves
to push people's buttons at first.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.542
But, listen, once you get to know her,

35:11.609 --> 35:13.703
you realize she's a real pain in the ass.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.379
Where does this go?

35:19.450 --> 35:21.316
I told you, you don't have to clean up.
You're our guest.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.080
It's okay, I like keeping busy.

35:28.759 --> 35:32.821
I like your sister. She reminds me of me
during my rebellious years.

35:32.930 --> 35:35.262
Yeah, I'd hate to imagine
what <i>you</i> were like back then.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.858
I wasn't that bad.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.131
I put on a front at first,
I'm not always that way.

35:42.306 --> 35:45.469
How'd you end up taking care of her?

35:45.543 --> 35:48.877
Well, her father died when I was younger,

35:48.980 --> 35:50.778
which left my mom
to take care of Mia and me,

35:50.848 --> 35:53.681
which was pretty tough on my mom,
especially 'cause...

35:53.784 --> 35:56.219
Actually, that goes
in the cupboard up there.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.516
- Here?
- Yeah, on the left.

36:01.726 --> 36:06.493
And so after that, I decided I'd do
what I could to take care of Mia.

36:06.597 --> 36:10.465
Cleaned up my act, stopped hanging out
with the wrong crowd and...

36:10.535 --> 36:13.027
I don't know, just didn't want her
to end up in some foster home.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.868
So I did what I could to keep her out,

36:15.973 --> 36:19.967
even though I don't know
shit about parenting.

36:20.044 --> 36:23.207
Well, it seems that, although you may have
fucked up in the past,

36:23.314 --> 36:24.975
you're getting your shit together now.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.643
Yeah, well, I have to keep my shit
together while I have Mia.

36:27.718 --> 36:30.518
Otherwise, I could lose her.

36:32.056 --> 36:33.546
Sorry, we've had all these cutbacks.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.820
I don't even really
get a lunch break anymore.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.327
It's fine.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.359
What'd I tell you about your cell phone?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.031
It's off.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.649
So, how are things
since the last time we spoke?

37:41.759 --> 37:43.727
It's better.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.956
Uh... At least...

37:46.964 --> 37:49.228
Well, my sister and I
started talking again.

37:51.235 --> 37:52.430
That's good.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.130
How'd you two start communicating?

37:55.239 --> 37:59.574
I don't know,
we just started talking again.

37:59.644 --> 38:04.343
I think part of it is that she broke up
with her boyfriend.

38:10.588 --> 38:11.714
Fuck.

38:42.787 --> 38:43.777
Where are you?

38:45.856 --> 38:46.880
Where are you?

38:52.663 --> 38:54.461
Here!

39:15.886 --> 39:18.617
You're making some real progress.
I'm glad to see it.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.497
- Get her!
- Get in the truck!

39:33.571 --> 39:35.972
Shh! Come on!

39:49.787 --> 39:51.255
Mia?

40:11.909 --> 40:14.037
<i>Hey, it's Mia,
leave a message.</i>

40:21.585 --> 40:25.283
Hi, yes, I think my sister's in trouble.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.259
No, no, I can't get ahold of her.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.523
<i>Okay, how old is your sister?</i>

40:32.596 --> 40:34.894
Well, she's-she's 16, and...

40:34.965 --> 40:36.933
<i>Has she been missing
for more than 24 hours?</i>

40:37.034 --> 40:40.231
- No, listen, she's only 16.
- <i>Okay, sir, stay calm.</i>

40:49.413 --> 40:50.642
Ethan Locke?

41:23.514 --> 41:25.744
Is that your sister?

41:27.084 --> 41:28.643
How did she die?

41:30.688 --> 41:33.350
Unfortunately, it looks like
she died of a drug overdose.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.323
I doubt she suffered.

41:43.601 --> 41:44.932
We'll give you some privacy.

42:07.258 --> 42:08.157
Mia.

42:13.597 --> 42:15.929
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.251
I'm very sorry to hear
about your sister's death.

42:36.353 --> 42:37.582
Do you wanna talk about it?

42:37.688 --> 42:40.214
Why? It's your fault.

42:41.926 --> 42:42.916
I'm sorry?

42:43.027 --> 42:45.325
You should be.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.421
If you hadn't made me turn off my phone,

42:47.531 --> 42:50.466
then I could've gotten to her in time.

42:50.568 --> 42:54.937
- All right, now listen.
- No, I'm done listening to you.

42:55.039 --> 42:57.406
That's all I've done,
is sit here and listen to you talk,

42:57.474 --> 43:00.705
and you've got nothing to say.
I'm not listening to you anymore.

43:01.779 --> 43:05.113
What, you think you're the only person
who's ever lost someone?

43:05.215 --> 43:07.445
You think you've got it so much worse
than everyone else?

43:07.551 --> 43:09.076
Let me tell you something, Locke.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.882
All day, every day,

43:10.955 --> 43:14.220
I deal with someone just like you,
who feels like they were wronged

43:14.291 --> 43:16.419
and that the whole world
owes them something

43:16.493 --> 43:19.724
because they were raised underprivileged.
Just another average Chicano.

43:19.797 --> 43:22.960
Only you don't see them
breaking into homes and stealing stuff.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.865
This is bullshit.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.267
Bullshit, hm? Let me tell you
what's bullshit, Ethan.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.863
The fact that you get
opportunity after opportunity,

43:29.940 --> 43:32.375
and you squander them endlessly.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.878
You wanna blame someone
for your sister's death?

43:34.945 --> 43:37.812
Then blame her for taking the drugs
in the first place!

43:37.915 --> 43:39.906
Blame the ones who put
the drugs in her hand!

43:39.984 --> 43:41.042
But do not blame society...

43:41.118 --> 43:43.746
You're absolutely right, Dr. Cruz.

43:48.225 --> 43:49.215
Hey, where are you going?

44:22.693 --> 44:25.162
My sister's dead! Who killed her?

44:25.262 --> 44:26.195
I don't know.

44:30.701 --> 44:32.931
It was Kaden. I couldn't give it to...

44:33.003 --> 44:35.267
You didn't give them the money,
did you, you fuck?

44:35.339 --> 44:36.306
I couldn't!

45:14.044 --> 45:15.739
Who the hell are you?

45:17.181 --> 45:19.707
Hey, what's your name?

45:21.785 --> 45:22.775
Huh?

45:25.222 --> 45:26.986
Put that away.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.492
- What?
- I said put that away.

45:32.162 --> 45:34.221
Why are you here?

45:34.331 --> 45:35.560
I know your face.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.331
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

45:39.403 --> 45:43.340
- What's your name again?
- Ethan.

45:43.407 --> 45:46.741
You just did
half my job for me, Ethan.

45:50.447 --> 45:52.745
You want a job, Ethan?

45:52.850 --> 45:55.012
- Yeah.
- Cool.

45:58.489 --> 45:59.888
I'll see you tomorrow.

46:02.893 --> 46:03.758
Okay.

46:06.330 --> 46:07.661
Don't be late.

46:12.302 --> 46:15.499
Why didn't you let me smoke him?

46:15.606 --> 46:17.335
He's already dead.

46:48.939 --> 46:49.770
Hey.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.270
Haven't seen you out for a smoke lately.

47:01.318 --> 47:05.721
I, uh, saw the pigs here earlier today.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.220
Wanted to make sure everything was okay.

47:11.395 --> 47:13.830
- Where...
- Yeah, yeah.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.194
Where's Mia?

47:16.567 --> 47:18.194
She, uh...

47:20.571 --> 47:22.733
She's not here any longer.

47:25.976 --> 47:27.808
Is she coming back?

47:32.449 --> 47:34.508
No, she...

47:36.553 --> 47:38.112
She...

48:43.954 --> 48:45.285
Wait here.

48:53.630 --> 48:56.395
What do you think
you're doing at my house, eh?

48:56.466 --> 48:59.060
- Hey, I'm off now, see you later.
- Bye, Dad.

49:02.039 --> 49:02.938
Go.

49:11.148 --> 49:13.810
- You got a nice-
- What the fuck are you doing at my house?

49:13.917 --> 49:15.407
- Kaden told me...
- No, I mean,

49:15.485 --> 49:17.351
what the fuck are you doing at my house?

49:17.454 --> 49:19.445
Don't you ever come
to my house again, you got that?

49:19.523 --> 49:22.959
I don't want you ever near, anywhere near
my fucking Kids, all right?

49:23.026 --> 49:24.858
Just doing what the boss told me to do.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.829
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!

49:29.933 --> 49:31.458
Fuck Kaden!

49:33.103 --> 49:35.902
You know, Kaden may be the boss,

49:35.973 --> 49:37.839
but he's sick and I'm the one
that's next in line.

49:37.941 --> 49:39.773
You understand that?

49:42.813 --> 49:44.679
See, I've got my eye...

49:49.619 --> 49:51.644
We just gonna talk all night?

49:55.092 --> 49:57.823
2701 Hawthorne Place.

49:59.629 --> 50:00.858
And do yourself a favor.

50:02.599 --> 50:05.466
You try and keep that little
mouth of yours shut, all right?

50:06.837 --> 50:08.362
Smile and drive.

50:08.472 --> 50:11.806
Smile and fucking drive.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.001
Smile and drive.

50:31.661 --> 50:35.063
- Sorry, guys, we're closed.
- Hello, Craig.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.793
Hey, Jake. What a surprise, man.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.394
- How are ya?
- Me?

50:40.504 --> 50:41.733
- Yeah.
- Fine.

50:41.838 --> 50:43.636
Right on! How's-how's Kaden?

50:43.707 --> 50:45.903
He still doing his baseball routine?

50:46.009 --> 50:48.740
Of course, what else?

50:48.845 --> 50:52.475
Who, uh, who's this guy?
I don't think I've seen him around before.

50:52.549 --> 50:55.018
Yeah, never mind about him.
Where have you been, Craig?

50:56.153 --> 50:58.315
Oh, I, um... I was down in Florida.

50:58.388 --> 51:01.050
My folks got really sick,
so I had to go down there.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.684
Um, but I just got back.
I was gonna give you a call.

51:03.760 --> 51:04.989
Hm.

51:06.696 --> 51:09.290
I see, I see.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.865
'Cause I heard different.

51:12.936 --> 51:16.133
I heard you've been back
for over a week.

51:17.874 --> 51:20.809
Uh, who told you that?

51:20.911 --> 51:24.643
No, no, no, I-I, like, just got back.
I was gonna come see you.

51:26.083 --> 51:29.246
Ahem. So you've got Kaden's money then?

51:30.954 --> 51:34.254
Uh, no, not yet.

51:34.324 --> 51:37.123
You see, this is the problem
with degenerates.

51:37.227 --> 51:40.356
No, no... No, no, no.
I'm-I'm gonna have it very soon.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.798
- Um, I'm expecting an inheritance.
- An inheritance?

51:43.900 --> 51:46.232
- Yeah, from my grandmother.
- From your grandmother, really?

51:46.303 --> 51:48.635
Well, yeah. She just died.
That's-that's why I had to go to Florida.

51:48.738 --> 51:50.035
It was a family emergency.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.269
It was a family emergency, nice, yeah.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.776
You getting this? Mm-hmm.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.980
Okay, fuck sakes, I'm gonna bury you.

51:59.082 --> 52:00.311
Oh, fuck. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

52:00.417 --> 52:02.545
Just a second, let me talk to him.

52:04.254 --> 52:07.280
- You take your hand off me.
- Just let me talk to him.

52:07.390 --> 52:09.222
- What the fuck are you gonna say?
- Just let me talk.

52:11.928 --> 52:14.590
You gotta come up with something now,
or he's gonna Kill you.

52:14.664 --> 52:17.099
- I don't have anything.
- Just come up with something.

52:17.167 --> 52:18.862
Fine, it's not on me.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.528
- I have my money in an account.
- Where?

52:20.637 --> 52:24.096
Uh... Here, it's a debit.

52:24.174 --> 52:25.266
He's got money.

52:29.613 --> 52:30.705
How much?

52:30.814 --> 52:32.942
There's like, uh, ten grand in there.

52:35.218 --> 52:36.276
PIN?

52:36.353 --> 52:39.288
Uh, nine, one, three, two.

52:41.625 --> 52:46.085
Okay, that's good. Thank you, Craig.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.157
No!

53:03.513 --> 53:05.106
Come on, smiley.

53:07.651 --> 53:08.812
You didn't have to kill him.

53:08.885 --> 53:10.717
Oh, what do you care, eh?

53:11.855 --> 53:12.981
And let me tell you something.

53:13.056 --> 53:16.583
If you wanna make it in this business,
then you have to learn to Kill.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.321
Because the people that Kaden hires,
they're actual psychopaths

53:19.396 --> 53:22.366
who enjoy killing and torturing.
And if you don't,

53:22.432 --> 53:24.924
then Kaden doesn't have any use for you
and neither do I.

53:30.840 --> 53:34.435
- <i>Jake.</i>
- Yeah, it's taken care of.

53:34.544 --> 53:37.844
<i>Head over to...</i>

53:37.914 --> 53:39.177
Got it.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.048
Boss has a job for you.

53:49.593 --> 53:52.221
You're dropping me off on the way. Drive.

54:17.220 --> 54:20.918
So, uh, you're our chauffeur tonight?

54:20.991 --> 54:23.426
- I guess so.
- Huh.

54:24.828 --> 54:25.989
Wait here.

54:34.304 --> 54:35.135
Come here.

54:38.775 --> 54:41.176
Get him in! Get him in.

54:44.314 --> 54:45.440
Hit him!

54:47.150 --> 54:51.747
Hey. Kyle.
It's nice to... meet ya.

54:51.821 --> 54:57.658
Yeah. Yeah, and this little scam artist,
shithead is Lars, isn't that right?

55:00.230 --> 55:02.324
All right, come on, head south.

55:02.432 --> 55:03.991
Where to?

55:05.168 --> 55:07.637
Don't worry, we'll get there. Now go.

55:09.839 --> 55:13.742
So you're Kaden's new driver, huh?

55:16.112 --> 55:19.980
Apparently, Kaden wants to send
someone along with us,

55:20.050 --> 55:23.315
'cause it's not like we haven't
been doing fine for years.

55:23.386 --> 55:26.151
Yeah, we've been doing just fine.

55:27.691 --> 55:31.218
So how hard was it to grab him?

55:31.328 --> 55:35.856
Uh, let's just say that his little-
his little girlfriend

55:35.965 --> 55:38.957
was-was twice as hard
as this little scum sucker.

55:42.138 --> 55:45.301
It's kinda funny, Lars.

55:45.375 --> 55:49.312
We shot your girl full of so many drugs,

55:49.379 --> 55:51.507
her little heart exploded.

55:59.322 --> 56:02.690
Oh, oh, um, make a left
and then pull over.

56:23.012 --> 56:24.343
Let's go.

56:46.469 --> 56:48.369
- Yeah?
- <i>Jan, did you get there?</i>

56:48.438 --> 56:50.873
- Yeah, we're here.
- <i>Get him on the phone.</i>

56:50.940 --> 56:52.339
Okay, hold on.

56:52.409 --> 56:56.004
<i>Listen, you cunt,
your whore of a girlfriend is dead.</i>

56:56.079 --> 56:59.014
- <i>Where's my money?</i>
- Wasn't my girlfriend.

56:59.082 --> 57:01.551
Just needed more time.

57:01.618 --> 57:03.950
Just trying to take care of my baby.

57:04.053 --> 57:05.714
Just needed more time!

57:05.789 --> 57:08.019
Mia was gonna get it from her brother.

57:08.091 --> 57:09.718
<i>You talk too much.</i>

57:09.793 --> 57:12.353
<i>You just get this wrapped up.</i>

57:12.429 --> 57:16.093
<i>Do what you gotta do. Ethan,
when you're done, you pick me up.</i>

57:17.267 --> 57:19.429
Wait, Eth...

57:21.504 --> 57:22.801
Let's get outta here.

57:27.911 --> 57:30.437
Come on!

57:51.267 --> 57:53.099
That was fun.

57:53.169 --> 57:55.297
Yeah.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.172
Ooh-wee!

57:58.274 --> 58:01.073
Well, I gotta go pick up Kaden, so...

58:01.144 --> 58:05.411
Yeah, well, we've got some other business
to take care of anyways, too.

58:05.482 --> 58:08.179
Yeah, got-gots the next on our list.

58:10.086 --> 58:15.525
All right, we'll, uh,
see you later, driver.

58:15.625 --> 58:16.922
Nice to meet ya.

59:29.065 --> 59:30.123
Ethan...

59:33.469 --> 59:35.369
this is a .38.

59:35.438 --> 59:36.530
It's got six shots.

59:39.442 --> 59:41.570
You point it, you squeeze the trigger.

59:41.644 --> 59:45.274
A fucking idiot could use it, right?
You ever shoot a gun before?

59:46.282 --> 59:47.772
No.

59:47.884 --> 59:50.376
Well, there's always a first time.

59:56.225 --> 59:57.715
<i>McMillan didn't have
anything on her.</i>

59:57.794 --> 01:00:00.525
- <i>What do you want us to do?</i>
- I want McMillan taken care of.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.122
<i>Oh, you got it.</i>

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.359
- You call me when it's done.
- <i>Okay, boss.</i>

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.700
Let's go, uh, grab a coffee.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:23.417
Hey, listen, don't get
all fucked up in the head

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:27.445
over that shit you had to do.
I mean, you did it, it's done.

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:30.288
It was the best you can. For...

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:32.955
Forget about it.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.293
Okay.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.930
There ain't no accidents in this life.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.633
There's a reason for everything.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:46.473
Uh...

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.370
I'll pick you up another gun,
if you like. It's your choice.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.516
- Wait, where are you going?
- Nowhere.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.179
- Well, what-what's in the backpack?
- Get outta my way, Mom.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.278
- No, what's in here?
- Nothing.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.518
- What is that? No, what is that?
- No.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.923
What is this?
Give it to me, give it to me.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:05.927
- Let go of it!
- Give it to me!

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.656
Let go of it!

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.009
Why do you kill?

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.172
Just business.

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:33.887
You know, sometimes there's
a lot of foolish people.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.755
They hit the jackpot with money,
they come to me.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.327
I give 'em what they need.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:44.264
And then there's the... the silly bastards

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:47.393
that think they can take advantage of you
and not pay you back,

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:50.495
and that's when things get ugly.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:54.033
It's nothing personal.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.511
Just strictly business.

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.741
Yeah, well, seems like Jan and Kyle...

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:01.613
Those two fuckers are just bugs.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.083
Just evil cocksuckers.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.417
All they care about is money and power.

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.889
You take the girl, for example.

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.325
You know, I told 'em
just take care of business.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.558
I didn't tell 'em
to torture the poor thing.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.373
Ah, fuck.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:31.572
You okay?

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:36.885
I'm here and I'm not here.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.958
Adriamycin. This is...

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.393
This is for cancer.

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:56.233
My mother,

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:59.935
she used to take Adriamycin
to help it stop from spreading.

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:05.780
Well, when your clock's punched...

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.718
your clock's punched.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.089
You know how long you have?

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.151
I don't have all the answers.

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:28.097
They'd give me more time, they said.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.631
Six months, a year.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.774
Two years if I take the chemo treatments.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:45.117
I don't really wanna walk around, drooling
all over myself,

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:49.648
having some hospice nurse I don't even
know her fucking name,

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.853
wiping my ass, you know...

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.960
I'm not afraid of...
I'm not afraid of death...

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:01.831
but I am afraid of dying. You know.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.064
How'd you get involved with all this?

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:11.307
I don't talk about it much, but...

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.814
I wanted to be a ball player.

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.819
And, uh, you know, I got, uh...

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.350
I had a... a pretty good shot.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:28.658
You know, I got drafted
out of high school at 17,

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:33.134
I was playing double-A, single-A ball
for about five years.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.569
And you know, it didn't work.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.639
I just... I wasn't good enough, I guess.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:39.706
So, uh...

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.106
I had to find something, you know?

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.410
This is not how I...

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.681
This is not how I planned my life to be.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:05:01.697
You know, I never wanted
to be a bad person or, you know...

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:06.725
I just... I just wanted to play ball, man.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.569
You know, I guess when your dreams
don't come true,

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:15.167
you know, you never forget
about them. You just...

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:22.012
I really, really wish things
would've worked out differently.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.921
<i>The girl, for example.</i>

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:34.690
<i>I didn't tell 'em
to torture the poor thing.</i>

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:39.634
<i>We shot your girl
full of so many drugs,</i>

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.466
<i>her little heart exploded.</i>

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:25.938
- Hey.
- Come on.

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:29.909
Come on!

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.258
I'm assuming you're here
on orders from Kaden.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.486
Yeah.

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.652
Nice to see you again.

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.992
Yeah, have a seat.

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.673
So what-what can we do for you?

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:57.645
Hey, I'm just curious.
Where do you guys get your drugs from?

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.380
Uh...

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.519
I mean, you ask Kaden that question?

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.889
Not yet.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.220
I guess we can tell you.

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.797
We got a little spot over on Grand Avenue.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.461
They got a whole operation over there.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.334
This shit is...

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:28.674
They guts
the good stuffs.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.576
That shit ain't cheap.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:34.047
But we got a little homie hookup
if you need something.

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.677
All right. Thanks, man.

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:43.322
I like you. I like... I like him.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.287
We can be best friends now.

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:50.593
You want a beer?

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.224
Yeah, sure, man.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.371
Hey, Jan, let me
ask you something. Is he...

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.431
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know
what you're thinking.

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:03.479
He's got a few screws loose.
But he's fucking loyal.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:05.980
Now he's excited to have another friend.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.211
That is, if you don't piss Kaden off.

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.549
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.645
To see that the job's done right.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:20.194
Hey, Kyle. Hey.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:28.029
Now Kaden is sending people
to our house to check on us.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:32.974
Told you that shit
was gonna happen after Lars.

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:34.872
Man.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.969
You know what? I'm ready.

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.710
Ready for what?

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.916
You watch what we do here
and you go tell the chief, okay?

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.013
I don't fucking care anymore.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:51.321
Let's do this. Let's do it.

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:53.657
Let's get this show on the road.
Are you hungry?

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:56.459
Man, get us some... get us some snacks.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:57.930
Come on.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.331
I'm gonna introduce you to our guest.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.995
Get up. Come on, man, let's do this.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.705
So this is a new gig for you?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.970
Yeah.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.876
Yeah, man, Kaden, he's a little uptight,

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.541
but at least he pays on time, you know?

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:22.783
So let's, uh, let's check her out.

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.993
See?

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.439
Here's McMillan. I told you,
nothing to worry about.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:39.202
Dumb ass woman.

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:41.276
Yeah, we're gonna take
care of you real soon.

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:44.438
Quick. Y'all end up here, don't you?

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.424
I got some snacks.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:17.110
Please, I thought that we were friends.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.181
You killed my sister.

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:24.046
We're... not... friends!

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.827
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.159
Hey. Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.529
Okay, you understand me?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.581
You're Mia's friend.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.589
You're... you're her brother.

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:09.897
You gotta get out of here right now
and never look back.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:12.957
Hey, do you hear me?
You gotta leave right now.

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:16.470
No, I can't... I can't leave without her.
They have her.

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:19.507
Who? Where?

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.769
My sister.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.139
She's inside there.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.784
I can't go in there. Please, please
don't make me go in there, please.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.793
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.488
You don't have to go in there.

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.697
What's her name?

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.998
Jessica.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.807
You wait here.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:16.221
Jake wants us to deliver
the drug shipments out by end of week.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:19.921
Also, kill the girl Jan brought. Got that?

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:22.756
Scott, I'm really liking the outfits
these other girls you...

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:40.400
Hey, Jen, is everything okay?

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:47.575
Jessica?

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:48.802
Please. Please, don't hurt me.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.971
I won't, I'm with your sister.

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:06.055
You made a big mistake coming here.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.401
That's all you got?

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.439
Get up, get up!

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.180
Jessica?

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.585
Jessica.

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.477
Did you find her?

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:43.882
My sister.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.357
Um...

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.793
Mia...

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:25.963
She loved you.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.340
She never wanted you
to get involved in this.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.540
Um...

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.539
She gave me this to give to you...

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.344
in case anything happened to her.

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.985
You need to get away from here.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.699
Don't look back.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.840
Go.

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.589
<i>Ethan, help.</i>

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.095
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:29.324
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.321
<i>Ethan,</i>

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.915
<i>if you're reading this,
then I'm probably dead.</i>

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:01.452
<i>I don't think I'll ever be able to get out
of the path I've chosen.</i>

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:04.124
<i>I want you to know that none of this
is your fault.</i>

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:07.794
<i>I'm really happy that we got to spend
some nice moments together.</i>

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:11.703
<i>I'm thankful to you that I finally
feel like myself again.</i>

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.775
<i>Now let me return the favor.</i>

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:16.834
<i>I know that you blame yourself
for Mom's death.</i>

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.344
<i>It's not your fault,</i>

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:21.677
<i>and my death isn't your fault either.</i>

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:24.081
<i>Live life to the fullest,</i>

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.780
<i>and try not to fuck things up with Chloe.</i>

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.254
<i>I like her for you.</i>

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:29.791
<i>I want you to be happy.</i>

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:32.156
<i>And it's what Mom would have wanted, too.</i>

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:39.093
Listen to me, Ethan.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.864
I want you to change your life.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:45.167
No more guns, okay? Promise me?

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:48.208
You already took my gun
from me, remember?

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.812
Now go make us some tea, will you?

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.177
Okay.

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:00.772
Remember Jake?

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:11.157
All right, let's go.
Take us to 1879 Harbor Lane.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.697
<i>It's Jan.
Have a great fucking day.</i>

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.930
Any luck?

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.061
Nothing.

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:29.109
What the fuck is going on?
Nobody's returning calls.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.770
They probably just got wasted
at some bar.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.871
Just stay on their ass. Who's next?

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.543
Uh, girl named Chloe.

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.643
Owes 30 grand,
had seven months to pay it off.

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:42.087
She used the money to pay
for her father's medical bills.

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:44.751
Went into hiding, but we found her.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.392
We're here.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.161
All right, let's go.

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:54.133
All right, Jake, stay here.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.499
Um, see if you can get 'em on the phone.

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.083
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:18.017
Yeah, keep smiling.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:35.075
<i>It's Jan.
Have a great fucking day.</i>

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.484
Yeah, it's Jake.

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.750
Ethan, what the fuck do you want?

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.513
- Come on! Come on!
- What... What the hell?

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.224
I see you two have met.

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:30.229
Oh, God.

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.992
What, you didn't think
I was gonna find you?

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:46.412
Come on, this way!

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:48.710
Straight!

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.118
Cut through here!

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.228
Go up!

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:31.319
Hey, you guys can't be up here! Hey!

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.520
Now what the fuck do you want?

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.387
Get out of the way, fucker.

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:38.451
No.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.153
Are you willing to die for that bitch?

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.526
Yeah, same as I was for my sister.

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.223
Her name was Mia.

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.860
Shit happens.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.697
Well, I paid off her debt to Dante.

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:50.567
He stole her money!

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:55.905
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:58.172
Get out of the way.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:00.375
Fuck you.

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:30.807
This is okay like this.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.744
It's okay. It's...

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.841
No bullets.

01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:23.262
Hey, come on.

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.663
It's okay, it's over now.

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.613
Ethan.

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.833
I'm surprised to see you're back.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:11.646
When last we spoke,
things did not go so well.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:16.546
Yeah, I guess so.

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:20.313
However, in light of your sister's death,

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.948
I figured you were going
through quite a lot.

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:25.656
So I didn't report you.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.352
This time.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:30.728
Thank you.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.032
I'm hoping you realize
I'm trying to help you.

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.372
Not everyone is against you.

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.532
You know that, right?

01:29:46.688 --> 01:29:51.688
