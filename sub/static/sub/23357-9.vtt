WEBVTT

00:10.203 --> 00:11.836
Costs us about $2,200.

00:11.871 --> 00:16.306
Per bed a day
just to keep chastain open.

00:16.341 --> 00:19.577
Now that's roughly
$160 million a year.

00:19.612 --> 00:20.945
And have you ever experienced.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.580
The serengeti, randolph?

00:22.615 --> 00:24.181
No, gordon,
but much more rewarding.

00:24.217 --> 00:25.657
Than waiting
for the rains in africa.

00:25.685 --> 00:27.485
Might be to help us
make it rain here.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.020
Like funding
your new surgical center?

00:30.056 --> 00:32.622
Well, in order to keep
brilliant, young surgeons.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.859
Like dr. Okafor here happy,
we need the...

00:34.894 --> 00:37.695
Is that why you were invited
here tonight, dr. Okafor?

00:37.730 --> 00:39.830
To, um, help persuade us?

00:39.866 --> 00:43.801
I was invited because I'm black.
Apparently diversity matters.

00:47.407 --> 00:50.441
Look at poor mina.

00:50.476 --> 00:52.009
I wish we could
throw her a lifeline.

00:52.044 --> 00:54.445
Why don't you go down there?
Help her out?

00:54.480 --> 00:56.714
I'll go if you go.

00:56.749 --> 00:59.216
I'd rather have a colonoscopy.

01:03.489 --> 01:07.625
They're in my ear. Can you...
Can you get them out?

01:07.660 --> 01:10.161
All right,
let's get back to work.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.396
Wait.

01:12.432 --> 01:13.531
Please.

01:13.566 --> 01:16.133
It hurts.

01:16.169 --> 01:19.003
Can you get them out?
It hurts. Please?

01:20.406 --> 01:22.506
Too loud. They're in my ear.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.710
Please, can you help me
get them out?

01:26.746 --> 01:28.679
Is that right?
Yes, that's... Yeah.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.181
They're in my head.
Get them out.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.816
Excuse me.

01:31.851 --> 01:33.284
They're in my ear. Get 'em out.

01:39.258 --> 01:41.325
Excuse me. Call for help.

01:48.801 --> 01:50.768
How did she get in here?

01:53.072 --> 01:55.072
She's got a pulse,
it's very slow.

01:56.542 --> 01:57.942
Pupils are equal and reactive.

01:57.977 --> 02:00.344
Scattered rhonchi,
but she's moving good air.

02:00.379 --> 02:03.347
Okay, everybody, just step back,
step back please.

02:03.382 --> 02:04.949
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:04.984 --> 02:06.295
Let's just give these doctors
some room to work.

02:06.319 --> 02:08.018
I need a ccollar
and backboard now.

02:08.054 --> 02:11.522
Okay, well, let's get this
poor soul to our er, and,

02:11.557 --> 02:14.291
Just keep me posted
on how she's doing.

02:14.327 --> 02:16.260
It's okay.

02:16.295 --> 02:18.596
She'll be all right.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.513 --> 02:36.480
They're in here.
They're in here.

02:36.516 --> 02:37.982
All right, let's get you
checked out.

02:38.017 --> 02:40.150
What's your name?
Are you having pain anywhere?

02:40.186 --> 02:41.285
Too loud.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.256
In my head, get them out.
My ear...

02:45.291 --> 02:48.225
Get them out.

02:48.261 --> 02:49.627
Here, I'll take the bags.

02:49.662 --> 02:51.395
No, no. Ready.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.797
One... Two... Three.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.267
When I asked you to bring me
something from the fundraiser,

02:56.302 --> 02:57.902
I meant, like, a crab cake.

02:57.937 --> 02:59.970
What do we got? Jane doe, 20s.

03:00.006 --> 03:01.972
Collapsed from syncopal episode.

03:02.008 --> 03:04.008
With blunt head trauma,
multiple abrasions,

03:04.043 --> 03:05.309
And a forehead laceration.

03:05.344 --> 03:07.778
Plus one hell of an ear infection.
Not seeing an id.

03:07.813 --> 03:08.991
She needs an altered
mental status workup.

03:09.015 --> 03:11.282
And a lac repair.
Trauma panel, ekg,

03:11.317 --> 03:13.262
Chest xray and head ct.
I'll take care of the lac.

03:13.286 --> 03:16.186
And risk getting blood on
that dress? I'll do the sutures.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.890
It's not that, ii can't see!

03:19.926 --> 03:21.025
No, I can handle the pain,

03:21.060 --> 03:23.160
I just,
I can't see out of this eye.

03:24.463 --> 03:26.697
Keep working here.
I'll grab that.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.035
Talk to me. -Channing brewster,
25yearold male.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.514
Ran through a glass door.
Facial lacerations,

03:32.538 --> 03:33.949
Multiple small cuts
to his arms and torso,

03:33.973 --> 03:35.339
Shards of glass in his left eye.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.941
Two episodes of vomiting
en route.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.476
I can't see out of this eye.
Okay, easy, mr. Brewster.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.345
I'm dr. Feldman,
I'll be taking care of you.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.647
I just want to take a look
at your eye, okay?

03:43.683 --> 03:45.816
Okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.185
Let's transfer him
and prepare to irrigate.

03:50.489 --> 03:53.490
Micah, hey. Sorry we had
to change your echo to tonight.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.125
It's been crazy around here.

03:55.161 --> 03:57.895
Yeah, I noticed. I was rerouted
from the front entrance.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.396
How's the new ticker?

03:59.432 --> 04:00.864
That's what I'm here
to find out.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.199
Admit him to the floor.

04:02.234 --> 04:04.868
On antibiotics and we'll
take him to the or tomorrow.

04:04.904 --> 04:07.304
Right away.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.207
Wow, dr. Okafor, I almost.

04:10.242 --> 04:11.820
Didn't recognize you
all supermodeled up.

04:11.844 --> 04:15.379
In for your 1,000 mile checkup?

04:15.414 --> 04:17.348
A patient who
actually follows up.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.850
Yeah.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.355
I will leave you two to it.

04:24.390 --> 04:28.058
I hear your heart donor's family
wants to meet you.

04:28.094 --> 04:30.828
They reached out through
the recovery program.

04:30.863 --> 04:32.663
Just not sure I'm ready
for that, yet.

04:32.698 --> 04:35.599
So don't meet them.
It's your heart now.

04:41.207 --> 04:43.285
No, actually, we'd like to keep
the guest list to 150.

04:43.309 --> 04:44.708
Nonsense.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.411
So few? That would barely cover
my cousins.

04:47.446 --> 04:48.846
Well, it's important.

04:48.881 --> 04:52.383
To us that we pay
for half the wedding,

04:52.418 --> 04:54.385
So we need to stick to our number.
Yes.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.354
But the groom's family
can also contribute,

04:57.390 --> 04:59.390
Not just the bride's. Of course.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.525
We can pay for more than just
flowers and the <i> mithai.</i>

05:01.560 --> 05:02.726
It's okay.

05:02.762 --> 05:06.597
Like I said, we got it covered.

05:06.632 --> 05:10.300
Besides, we want to keep it
small and intimate.

05:13.639 --> 05:16.073
Let's talk about something else.

05:18.577 --> 05:23.981
So, priya, your father
is a barrister in london, yes?

05:24.016 --> 05:25.215
That's right.

05:25.251 --> 05:26.950
How does he feel
about you marrying.

05:26.986 --> 05:28.152
The son of a taxi driver?

05:28.187 --> 05:30.454
Tejan. My parents are very fond.

05:30.489 --> 05:32.923
Of your son, mr. Pravesh.

05:34.527 --> 05:37.261
They don't discuss things
like this in their family.

05:37.296 --> 05:41.765
Well, judgments
get passed in silence.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.467
Your occupation
has never come up.

05:45.438 --> 05:48.439
And it is my decision
who I marry, not my father's.

05:58.684 --> 06:01.452
And the check, sir.
I have to get back.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.620
Do you have to leave now?

06:03.656 --> 06:05.989
The hospital is shortstaffed
and they need me.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.327
No more questions, dad, and...
We got it.

06:10.362 --> 06:12.062
Let me.

06:13.365 --> 06:14.531
We discussed this.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.700
It's okay.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.377
Her head ct and drug and alcohol
screen came back normal.

06:27.413 --> 06:30.447
Thinking she's altered from
an underlying psych disorder.

06:30.483 --> 06:32.116
We need a medical reason
to admit her.

06:32.151 --> 06:33.729
Well, she does have an area
of pneumonia on her xray.

06:33.753 --> 06:35.519
Plus the ear infection,
but technically,

06:35.554 --> 06:37.532
We should just discharge her
on oral antibiotics for that.

06:37.556 --> 06:39.234
Yeah, no, we can't do that. That's not right.
- Yeah, I know,

06:39.258 --> 06:41.759
I will be admitting her,
I'm just trying to...

06:44.497 --> 06:46.663
I remember her saying
she felt severe chest pain.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.666
Before she collapsed, don't you?

06:49.702 --> 06:52.536
That'll buy her an admission.

06:52.571 --> 06:55.405
I mean, I'm not sure it's
gonna fly with admin, but...

06:55.441 --> 06:58.675
Yeah, too bad.
We're out of options.

07:01.413 --> 07:02.679
These drops will sting.

07:02.715 --> 07:04.515
For a few seconds,
but then numb the pain.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.316
Okay. Look down.

07:08.187 --> 07:10.354
Blink. Good. Yeah. Thanks.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.923
We'll try irrigating,
and if this doesn't work,

07:12.958 --> 07:15.559
Then we'll pull those
little suckers one at a time.

07:15.594 --> 07:16.894
Look down.

07:16.929 --> 07:19.363
Whwhat about the face?

07:19.398 --> 07:22.699
I mean, is it gnarly?
Do I need stitches?

07:22.735 --> 07:24.902
That's a no to the gnarly
and the stitches.

07:24.937 --> 07:27.337
You got lucky.

07:27.373 --> 07:29.740
How in the world did you
run through a glass door?

07:29.775 --> 07:31.942
Occupational hazard.

07:31.977 --> 07:34.211
I was trying to get away
from my client's husband.

07:34.246 --> 07:38.081
Yeah? You, like,
a private eye? Divorce lawyer?

07:38.117 --> 07:40.083
No. Although,
in my line of work,

07:40.119 --> 07:41.251
I definitely run into both.

07:42.721 --> 07:45.389
I'm in the, um,
service business.

07:48.928 --> 07:50.561
You're a gigolo?

07:50.596 --> 07:53.330
Well, we prefer "male escort."

08:02.408 --> 08:05.609
Pretty. So pretty.

08:09.515 --> 08:13.884
The painting.
Yeah, it is pretty.

08:13.919 --> 08:15.519
Here.

08:21.927 --> 08:23.994
Were you at another hospital?

08:27.199 --> 08:29.533
Did you come from
another hospital?

08:32.638 --> 08:34.878
Let me get you something to eat.
I'll be back, all right?

08:38.844 --> 08:41.445
I think our jane doe was
dropped off by another hospital.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.624
Hospitals dumping
homeless patients.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.349
Not only pisses me off,
it's illegal.

08:45.384 --> 08:47.117
We sure she didn't
elope on her own?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.819
It's not likely.

08:48.854 --> 08:52.089
I know exactly what hospital
this ekg lead comes from.

08:52.124 --> 08:55.559
They've done it before, conrad.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.258
A little overdressed for work.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.893
I was at dinner.

09:04.928 --> 09:06.372
I'd say I'm sorry for
interrupting date night,

09:06.396 --> 09:07.662
But I'd be lying.

09:07.698 --> 09:09.064
It wasn't a date
as much as it was.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.832
An interrogation by my father.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.701
You got me confused
with someone who cares.

09:12.736 --> 09:15.270
I need you to head down to
the er. Irving's shorthanded.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.572
Needs help with the gigolo.

09:17.607 --> 09:18.873
Wait.

09:18.909 --> 09:20.408
Did you say gigolo?

09:20.444 --> 09:22.410
It's really about
the little details.

09:22.446 --> 09:25.413
Personal touches
in every patient's room.

09:25.449 --> 09:27.882
Personal menus.

09:27.918 --> 09:30.051
We also keep
a fullon staff of nurses,

09:30.087 --> 09:32.687
Make sure everyone.

09:32.723 --> 09:34.022
Has that oneonone feeling...

09:34.057 --> 09:36.791
Why was this woman admitted?

09:36.827 --> 09:39.027
Just following through
on your promise to the donors.

09:39.062 --> 09:41.229
That we'd get her the best care
in the city.

09:41.264 --> 09:43.064
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

09:44.434 --> 09:46.434
Randolph,
is everything all right?

09:46.470 --> 09:49.871
Yup. Everything's fine.
Be with you in one second.

09:49.906 --> 09:51.317
We don't know what's wrong
with our jane doe.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.141
We had to admit her
to run more tests.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.576
And before you ask,

09:54.611 --> 09:56.444
She tested negative
for any drugs or alcohol.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.424
Okay, wouldn't she be more
comfortable in the psych ward.

09:58.448 --> 09:59.814
On an involuntary hold?

09:59.850 --> 10:01.127
Trent from psych
already examined her.

10:01.151 --> 10:02.395
He doesn't think
she's mentally ill.

10:02.419 --> 10:03.463
That's why we're
doing more tests.

10:03.487 --> 10:05.487
We're not running
a charity here.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.122
Well, you're the
chief of surgery.

10:07.157 --> 10:08.623
You know it's not your call.

10:08.658 --> 10:10.236
I'm the highestranking
member of the board.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.826
Currently on the premises.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.828
And it sure as hell
isn't a resident's call.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.930
Treat her for the bare minimum
and street her.

10:15.966 --> 10:17.999
That makes us no better
than atlanta general.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.134
Atlanta general?

10:19.169 --> 10:21.269
This lead goes with a new.

10:21.304 --> 10:23.772
Alldigital ekg machine
from cardiosure.

10:23.807 --> 10:25.284
Atlanta general
has the only one in town.

10:25.308 --> 10:26.853
I've been trying to get one
here for months.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.277
Yeah, but, nic, we got that
fancy cappuccino machine.

10:29.312 --> 10:31.346
Up in the vip wing.
Just call atlanta general.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.015
And tell them to come
and pick up their problem.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.918
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

10:36.953 --> 10:40.855
You know, I just,
I forget who I'm talking to.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.490
I'll do it.

10:42.526 --> 10:44.370
How are you gonna get
atlanta general to do anything?

10:44.394 --> 10:45.827
It's simple. We just call them,

10:45.862 --> 10:47.473
Tell them to come pick up
their responsibility,

10:47.497 --> 10:49.675
Unless they want to be the
lead story on the 10:00 news.

10:49.699 --> 10:52.300
"Atlanta general unwilling
to treat homeless patients,

10:52.335 --> 10:55.403
"Now dumps them
on chastain's door." -all right.

10:57.507 --> 10:59.941
They're just going to dump her
on the street again.

10:59.976 --> 11:02.677
The oneonone...
We can't let that happen.

11:02.712 --> 11:06.414
Very important to us
that patients feel comfortable.

11:20.831 --> 11:24.566
Nice, nicely done.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.334
Sorry, it wasn't my idea
to call you back.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.402
It was conrad's.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.504
It's okay, he did me a favor.

11:29.539 --> 11:31.573
Not that priya was thrilled.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.219
Your parents and your fiancÃ©e
don't get along?

11:33.243 --> 11:34.709
No, no, no. Priya loves them.

11:34.744 --> 11:36.878
It's just my old man
who's got the issues.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.680
He gets all squirrely and weird.

11:38.715 --> 11:40.849
When it comes to his money
and pride.

11:40.884 --> 11:43.918
Has a lot to do with how
he was brought up in india.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.222
Great. So, how's the pain?

11:47.257 --> 11:48.556
It's, great.

11:48.592 --> 11:50.558
As in, I don't feel any.

11:50.594 --> 11:52.994
It sounds like your dad's all
caught up in the caste system.

11:53.029 --> 11:54.373
Is your fiancÃ©e
in a different caste?

11:54.397 --> 11:57.165
Is that thethe problem?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.778
What do you know
about the indian caste system?

11:58.802 --> 11:59.912
It's a paradigmatic,
ethnographic.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.603
Social stratification.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.937
That determines the behavior.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.006
Of one member of society
over another.

12:05.041 --> 12:08.209
Ii was an international studies
major. Yeah.

12:08.245 --> 12:10.411
I took a special interest
in southeast asia.

12:10.447 --> 12:14.549
The whole caste system thing,
it's archaic.

12:14.584 --> 12:16.284
So, the whole,
male escort thing,

12:16.319 --> 12:17.752
Is that to pay off
student loans?

12:17.787 --> 12:19.087
I don't carry student loans.

12:19.122 --> 12:21.055
Job pays well.

12:21.091 --> 12:24.192
I mean, that could change if I
end up looking like leatherface.

12:24.227 --> 12:26.728
Nah. Battle wounds.

12:26.763 --> 12:27.962
Gives you character.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.099
The news is good, micah.

12:31.134 --> 12:32.267
No sign of rejection,

12:32.302 --> 12:34.202
Your ef's up to 54%.

12:34.237 --> 12:35.904
The valves are functioning well,

12:35.939 --> 12:38.940
Limited view of the aortic root
from shadowing,

12:38.975 --> 12:40.542
But overall,
everything looks good.

12:40.577 --> 12:42.544
I knew that.
Wasn't worried at all.

12:44.314 --> 12:46.281
You're laughing.

12:46.316 --> 12:47.549
That's always a good sign.

12:47.584 --> 12:49.584
We're all done here, micah.

12:49.619 --> 12:51.097
I'm going to leave you
in nurse nevin's capable hands.

12:51.121 --> 12:52.554
See you next month. All right.

12:52.589 --> 12:53.755
Thanks.

12:53.790 --> 12:54.989
That has to be a huge relief.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.491
Let's get you out of here.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.059
You know, actually,
my surgical scar's.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.627
Been a little irritated.

12:59.663 --> 13:01.073
I'm worried it's not
healing properly.

13:01.097 --> 13:03.264
Looks okay,
but better safe than sorry,

13:03.300 --> 13:04.911
I'll see if dr. Peterson can come back.
It's okay.

13:04.935 --> 13:07.001
Can dr. Okafor check it out?

13:07.037 --> 13:09.470
I mean, since she's here.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.906
And she was on
my surgical team...

13:14.177 --> 13:17.478
I got to go, but I'll see if
she's available.

13:17.514 --> 13:19.113
Okay.

13:21.284 --> 13:23.451
What happened?
Found her hypotensive.

13:23.486 --> 13:26.588
And coughing up large clots.
Sats are dropping.

13:26.623 --> 13:27.755
I think it's her lungs.

13:27.791 --> 13:29.357
We need pulmonary.
Page dr. Hoffman.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.170
And activate massive transfusion
protocol with the blood bank.

13:31.194 --> 13:32.460
Paging dr. Hoffman.

13:34.998 --> 13:37.165
Dr. Hoffman's in the middle
of an er bronch.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.711
It says he'll be here
in 15 to 20 minutes.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.969
She'll drown in her own blood
in ten.

13:41.004 --> 13:43.404
Then I'll intubate her myself.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.475
Infiltrate's on the left,

13:47.510 --> 13:48.854
That's probably what's causing
the bleeding.

13:48.878 --> 13:50.511
Hurry, her sats are dropping.

13:54.317 --> 13:56.618
Airway's filled with blood.

13:56.653 --> 13:58.064
I need to intubate
just the right lung.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.821
Sats are down to 74%.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.763
Okay, through the cords.

14:11.234 --> 14:13.534
Rotating 90 degrees.

14:18.575 --> 14:20.541
Hoping I can block the bleeding
from the left.

14:20.577 --> 14:21.776
And still ventilate her.

14:33.723 --> 14:35.590
No breath sounds on the left.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.258
Blow up the balloon.

14:42.766 --> 14:44.999
Sats are coming back up.

14:45.035 --> 14:46.434
This is just a bandaid.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.002
Page mina.

14:48.038 --> 14:50.238
She needs a bronchoscopy
right away.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.206
Paging dr. Okafor.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.640
Bleeding has stopped.
The cautery worked.

15:01.676 --> 15:04.610
Let me get a tissue sample
for biopsy while I'm here.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.247
So, this is where the lesion.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.917
Eroded the bronchus,
causing her to hemorrhage?

15:11.953 --> 15:15.454
Doesn't look like pneumonia.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.957
It can be any number of things,

15:17.992 --> 15:19.992
Including cancer.
Got the sample.

15:20.027 --> 15:21.371
We need to start
narrowing down the differential.

15:21.395 --> 15:23.362
Get her to imaging for a ct.

15:23.397 --> 15:24.508
And send the biopsy
off to the lab.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.932
That's expensive.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.934
Since when do you care
about the cost of tests?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.270
Not tests. This bag.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.907
This is an xavier mellino
original.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.676
It's worth $148,000.

15:37.712 --> 15:39.178
What... Hhow do you know that?

15:39.213 --> 15:41.780
I know stitching.
Probably found it in a dumpster.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.282
Or snatched it from the owner.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.351
Nic already looked
for an id in there.

15:45.386 --> 15:47.553
Oneofakinds like this usually
have the owner's name.

15:47.588 --> 15:49.321
Inscribed on the inside.

15:54.929 --> 15:56.328
Sara ravenscroft.

15:56.364 --> 15:58.197
Her name even sounds rich.

15:58.232 --> 15:59.899
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear.

15:59.934 --> 16:01.834
That we found her
$100 grand purse.

16:01.869 --> 16:03.202
Maybe there's a reward.

16:03.237 --> 16:04.336
Maybe.

16:08.609 --> 16:10.843
Or maybe...

16:10.878 --> 16:13.045
Our jane doe
is sara ravenscroft.

16:14.448 --> 16:16.382
<i>She is the daughter.</i>

16:16.417 --> 16:18.250
Of lawrence and veronica
ravenscroft.

16:18.286 --> 16:20.686
They're wealthy philanthropists
out of savannah.

16:20.721 --> 16:22.232
Wait, how does the daughter
of one of the most.

16:22.256 --> 16:23.689
Prominent families in georgia.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.424
End up sick and living
on the streets?

16:25.459 --> 16:27.104
According to one
of the savannah gossip blogs,

16:27.128 --> 16:28.994
Sara is estranged
from her family.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.041
She left town a couple months
ago to become an artist.

16:31.065 --> 16:33.098
Is she out of imaging yet?

16:33.134 --> 16:34.767
Was just about to check.

16:34.802 --> 16:36.735
Yeah, you get that,
I'll check on sara.

16:36.771 --> 16:39.071
Mina, you've got something else
What?

16:39.106 --> 16:41.040
Pressing surgery?

16:41.075 --> 16:42.575
A certain lovesick transplantee.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.577
Has something wrong
with his scar.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.413
This is a waste of my time.
You know his scar is fine.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.281
Mina, you know micah
has feelings for you.

16:49.317 --> 16:51.094
If you want them to go away,
you've got to deal with them.

16:51.118 --> 16:52.418
Be gentle.

16:52.453 --> 16:54.019
The poor guy just got
a brandnew heart.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.255
I'm always gentle.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.057
A little swelling is normal.

16:58.092 --> 17:01.126
I'll prescribe some
vitamin e ointment.

17:01.162 --> 17:04.195
To help with the healing.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.709
I wasn't really worried
about my scar.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.800
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

17:08.836 --> 17:10.814
What I actually wanted to discuss.
Look, micah...

17:10.838 --> 17:12.816
It'sit's my heart donor.
Turns out he was a convicted.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.740
Car thief who was let out
on parole.

17:14.775 --> 17:17.643
You have a felon's heart?
Ironic, right?

17:17.678 --> 17:19.078
Me, a minister's son.

17:19.113 --> 17:21.446
Anyway, I went online, right?

17:21.482 --> 17:23.415
And there's this thing
called cellular memory.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.095
Where the person
who receives the donor organ.

17:25.118 --> 17:27.097
Sometimes takes on the
characteristics of the donor.

17:27.121 --> 17:29.722
You know, like their taste
in music and food... -

17:29.757 --> 17:31.268
No, I'm serious.
Look, what if I develop a taste.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.259
For aggravated assault
or armed robbery?

17:33.294 --> 17:35.828
Okay, calm down, idi amin.

17:35.863 --> 17:38.008
I'm sure there are studies
from reputable medical journals.

17:38.032 --> 17:39.632
To dispute this nonsense.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.278
I will look into it and
get back to you tomorrow.

17:41.302 --> 17:43.602
Why not tonight? I'm stressed.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.415
That could be bad for my health.
My shift is...

17:45.439 --> 17:47.072
I can wait until you're done.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.174
Maybe we can discuss it
over a cup of coffee.

17:52.513 --> 17:54.813
Fine.

17:54.849 --> 17:58.384
One cup, black, to go.

18:03.157 --> 18:06.959
So how long till
I can see out of this eye?

18:06.994 --> 18:08.372
Depends on how quickly
the swelling goes down,

18:08.396 --> 18:09.995
But I'm optimistic.

18:10.031 --> 18:12.298
The injuries seem superficial.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.211
I've paged an ophthalmologist
to take a second look.

18:14.235 --> 18:16.869
And once he gives you
the okay, you can go.

18:21.842 --> 18:26.578
So your fiancÃ©e, is she
kshatriya or vaishya?

18:29.417 --> 18:33.686
She's, um, she's kshatriya.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.155
And, your parents, theythey
immigrated here, right?

18:36.190 --> 18:37.990
What's your dad do?

18:38.025 --> 18:39.703
He owns a medallion cab
in queens and I'm done.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.894
Talking about this. -So you are
the successful son.

18:41.929 --> 18:44.029
Of an honest,
workingclass family.

18:44.065 --> 18:46.565
I'm guessing your family
is vaishya.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.635
As a gigolo, shouldn't you be
a man of action, not words?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.870
Okay. First, male escort.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.417
Second, mmost of my clients
just want to talk.

18:53.441 --> 18:56.075
Look here.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.910
So your fiancÃ©e's
in the higher caste,

18:57.945 --> 18:59.690
Which probably makes your dad
feel insecure. -

18:59.714 --> 19:01.580
Or is it her family
that has issues?

19:01.615 --> 19:04.583
Our families haven't even met.

19:04.618 --> 19:07.986
You're not gonna wait for them
to meet at the wedding, are you?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.225
You got to be kidding me.

19:17.965 --> 19:20.099
What are you guys doing here?

19:20.134 --> 19:21.400
Where'swhere's priya?

19:21.435 --> 19:23.001
She dropped us at the hotel.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.204
Our flight leaves early
tomorrow morning.

19:25.239 --> 19:27.740
We were worried that we wouldn't
get a chance to say goodbye.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.842
We barely got
to see you this trip,

19:29.877 --> 19:31.243
So we took a cab over here.

19:31.278 --> 19:33.445
Pleasant driver from belize.
Nice car.

19:33.481 --> 19:35.214
Little too chatty.

19:35.249 --> 19:37.383
We know you're busy,
we'll just sit.

19:37.418 --> 19:40.552
And whenever you get a coffee
break, you just come and visit.

19:40.588 --> 19:42.032
Is there a gift shop?
Maybe I'll get a book.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.522
The gift shop is closed
and we don't,

19:43.557 --> 19:45.791
We don't have coffee breaks.

19:45.826 --> 19:49.461
Honey, we haven't seen you
in months.

19:49.497 --> 19:52.264
Just watching you work
makes me happy.

19:52.299 --> 19:53.699
You can't watch me work, mom.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.434
There are rules
about these things.

19:55.469 --> 19:57.069
We'll grab a bite
and wait, then.

19:57.104 --> 20:00.539
The cafe is closed, dad.
The gift shop is closed.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.409
Everything is closed
but the savinglives part.

20:03.444 --> 20:05.911
Of this building, okay?

20:07.148 --> 20:09.214
You should have called first.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.617
Do you not want us to be here?

20:11.652 --> 20:13.263
Do you not want us
meeting your colleagues?

20:13.287 --> 20:17.322
What? No. Okay,
thatthat's ridiculous.

20:18.859 --> 20:22.060
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

20:22.096 --> 20:24.396
You can stay. There's a nice
waiting area upstairs.

20:24.432 --> 20:25.798
And I will drop by when I can,

20:25.833 --> 20:28.400
But right now I have to go.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.669
I have patients that need me.

20:30.704 --> 20:33.305
All right?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.780
He's under a lot of pressure.

20:41.816 --> 20:43.982
Excuse me.

20:44.018 --> 20:46.118
Where did you get that?

20:46.153 --> 20:48.353
On the buffet tables.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.094
My gosh,
you have to turn that off.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.763
You're making me so nervous.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.366
Hi. Hi, um, wow.

21:01.402 --> 21:05.170
I can't believe
that you guys are all here.

21:05.206 --> 21:07.606
To see this dream come true.

21:07.641 --> 21:12.711
Painting has been a passion
of mine since I was a child.

21:12.746 --> 21:14.713
So, thank you.

21:14.748 --> 21:18.383
To all of you,
to the thackery gallery and,

21:18.419 --> 21:21.820
Especially to my parents.

21:21.856 --> 21:24.056
Okay, sorry.
That is enough out of me.

21:24.091 --> 21:25.635
I'm so nervous,
I might actually run the risk.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.859
Of talking all night.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.227
So, enjoy the show.

21:28.262 --> 21:30.462
Which we know.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.464
Will be the first of many.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.999
Thank you, dad. Thank you.

21:34.034 --> 21:36.368
Thank you, dad. Enjoy the show.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.310
Hello?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.647
Hi, um, my name's, nic nevin.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.760
I'm calling from chastain park
memorial hospital in atlanta.

21:50.784 --> 21:53.318
Your daughter, sara,
is being treated here.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.254
Is she all right?

21:55.289 --> 21:57.656
Well, she's safe, but
I'mi'm afraid she's quite ill,

21:57.691 --> 21:59.725
Which is why I'm calling. Yes...

21:59.760 --> 22:04.029
I know. She has...
Paranoid schizophrenia.

22:04.064 --> 22:05.697
She refused to take
her medication,

22:05.733 --> 22:07.878
And we told her if she was going
to live in this house,

22:07.902 --> 22:10.202
She would have to.

22:10.237 --> 22:12.204
That was the last time
we saw her.

22:12.239 --> 22:14.072
Mrs. Ravenscroft...

22:14.108 --> 22:17.743
Ii assume you're putting her on
a psychiatric hold.

22:17.778 --> 22:21.079
Um, we'll cover all
of her expenses.

22:21.115 --> 22:24.182
Maybe you will have more luck
getting her on antipsychotics.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.118
Mrs. Ravenscroft,
the doctors don't believe.

22:26.153 --> 22:27.686
That she's mentally ill.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.188
Forgive me
if I can't take the word.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.090
Of some random er.

22:32.126 --> 22:34.226
Over the diagnosis of
a worldrenowned psychiatrist.

22:34.261 --> 22:35.794
That examined her.

22:35.829 --> 22:38.130
Maybe if you just,
if you just came to see sara.

22:38.165 --> 22:40.132
She's scared and alone.

22:40.167 --> 22:41.378
Ii really think
it would help if...

22:41.402 --> 22:42.701
She's schizophrenic.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.737
She needs to accept it.

22:45.773 --> 22:48.440
Please don't fill her head
with a lot of false hope.

22:48.475 --> 22:51.443
Just give her the meds
that she needs.

22:51.478 --> 22:53.478
Thank you.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.810
You guys reach her parents?
Yeah, they're not coming.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.645
Her mom's convinced
sara's schizophrenic.

23:11.782 --> 23:13.782
We need to figure out
what the real diagnosis is.

23:13.818 --> 23:15.384
Well, that's not gonna happen.

23:15.419 --> 23:17.786
She's getting sent back
to atlanta general.

23:17.822 --> 23:19.800
They'll just treat her for
a pneumonia she doesn't have,

23:19.824 --> 23:22.458
Load her up with olanzapine
and turf her again.

23:22.493 --> 23:25.527
Or worse, banish her
to their psych ward.

23:30.468 --> 23:32.634
Where're you going?

23:36.640 --> 23:39.975
This place feels pricey.

23:42.513 --> 23:46.248
Champagne, dr. Hawkins?
No, thank you.

23:46.283 --> 23:49.151
Dr. Hawkins, could it be?

23:49.186 --> 23:51.687
Hhimaya, this is
dr. Conrad hawkins.

23:51.722 --> 23:55.157
The mentor. So nice to meet you.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.259
I didn't catch a name.

23:57.294 --> 23:58.527
I'm tejan, and this is himaya.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.095
We're devon's parents.

24:00.130 --> 24:01.830
Right, yes, you're in town. Wow.

24:01.866 --> 24:03.465
It's... it's so nice to meet you.

24:03.501 --> 24:04.933
So nice to meet you, too.

24:04.969 --> 24:08.036
Thank you for everything
you've done for our son. -Yes.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.305
You should be very proud of him.
Excuse me,

24:10.341 --> 24:11.874
I have to talk to someone.
Of course.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.108
He's so nice. Very nice.

24:13.143 --> 24:15.377
Who are they?

24:15.412 --> 24:18.347
I think I heard
telecom billionaire. I just..

24:18.382 --> 24:19.882
Yeah.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.950
I have some news.

24:21.986 --> 24:24.620
We just admitted a vip,
sara ravenscroft.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.388
Of the savannah ravenscrofts?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.290
The very wealthy
and philanthropic

24:28.325 --> 24:30.993
Savannah ravenscrofts. Correct.

24:31.028 --> 24:33.362
You put her on the 16th floor,
I hope.

24:33.397 --> 24:35.864
That's a good idea.
I should... I'm, I just...

24:35.900 --> 24:37.477
I had her flying coach,
but let's upgrade her.

24:37.501 --> 24:39.167
To the vip wing immediately.

24:39.203 --> 24:40.502
Okay, well, I should go see her.

24:40.538 --> 24:41.904
Well, you've already met her.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.459
She was here at
the fundraiser earlier.

24:45.009 --> 24:47.342
Fiveseven, blonde hair,
dark roots.

24:47.378 --> 24:49.578
Carrying a $100,000
xavier mellino bag.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.714
I'm not gonna lie,
she could use a shower.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.853
Sara ravenscroft is...

25:00.858 --> 25:02.168
Well, get her up
on the 16th floor,

25:02.192 --> 25:03.692
And I'll be up there
in a minute.

25:03.727 --> 25:06.061
Sure. But you have to deal with
atlanta general first.

25:06.096 --> 25:10.899
You did call them to come get
their jane doe, right?

25:12.436 --> 25:14.202
Yeah.

25:26.951 --> 25:29.685
I appreciate the call, randolph.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.954
Listen, I am sorry about
the jane doe.

25:31.989 --> 25:35.624
Apparently, she ran off when
personnel just wasn't looking.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.894
Right. And walked three miles
to the closest hospital.

25:38.929 --> 25:41.263
Despite a severely compromised
sense of direction.

25:41.298 --> 25:44.032
Denying someone proper treatment
when they present.

25:44.068 --> 25:45.801
With a clear emergency
medical condition.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.036
Is a violation
of federal law, gavin.

25:48.072 --> 25:49.104
Listen.

25:49.139 --> 25:51.073
If one of our people turfed.

25:51.108 --> 25:52.641
A homeless patient
to your hospital,

25:52.676 --> 25:54.076
They will be terminated.

25:54.111 --> 25:55.121
Look, the only reason you're
here is because.

25:55.145 --> 25:56.545
We threatened to tell the media

25:56.580 --> 25:58.280
Atlanta general dumps
its undesirables.

25:58.315 --> 26:00.415
You're lucky we didn't
call the cops.

26:00.451 --> 26:02.551
Randolph, if you came to us
with the same problem,

26:02.586 --> 26:04.086
We would handle it
with discretion.

26:04.121 --> 26:06.321
Well, unlike your hospital,

26:06.357 --> 26:09.057
We treat everyone who
walks through these doors.

26:09.093 --> 26:10.726
So, what's really at play, here?

26:10.761 --> 26:11.960
At play?

26:11.996 --> 26:13.662
You played us, gavin.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.298
We're done here. You won.

26:23.941 --> 26:26.174
Llisten, I promise you,
they're gonna have you back up.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.843
Dancing the salsa with, um,

26:27.878 --> 26:29.022
What's your boyfriend's
name again?

26:29.046 --> 26:31.079
Joe, but he doesn't dance much.

26:31.115 --> 26:32.481
I'm telling you right now.

26:32.516 --> 26:34.116
You could teach him
how to dance, right?

26:35.819 --> 26:37.352
How did you get here
from your bed?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.965
The nurse was nice enough
to help me out.

26:38.989 --> 26:40.166
You see, mrs. Reed's a little.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.690
Nervous about her
fractured ankle,

26:41.725 --> 26:44.126
So I'm just keeping her company
till the doctors come back.

26:44.161 --> 26:45.861
I am better.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.963
Thank you. Carry on.

26:47.998 --> 26:49.831
What's up?

26:49.867 --> 26:53.435
He's working the room pro bono.
Hey,

26:53.470 --> 26:55.370
You guys save lives,

26:55.406 --> 26:57.039
I save people from loneliness.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.708
It's like my superpower.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.987
Are you all right?
Your voice sounds different.

27:01.011 --> 27:02.277
And his breathing.

27:02.312 --> 27:04.946
My chest feels tight.

27:04.982 --> 27:06.748
Having a hard time breathing.

27:09.553 --> 27:11.364
Palpable air under the skin.
Subcutaneous emphysema.

27:11.388 --> 27:12.988
Do you think
he swallowed some glass?

27:13.023 --> 27:14.890
What's going on?
Get up. Let's get you up.

27:14.925 --> 27:18.060
Your vomiting en route
may have been forceful enough.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.028
To cause an esophageal
perforation.

27:20.064 --> 27:21.329
Air is leaking into your chest.

27:21.365 --> 27:22.631
We need a stat ct chest,

27:22.666 --> 27:24.566
Esophagram, and call the or.

27:31.842 --> 27:33.475
So, if it's not mental illness.

27:33.510 --> 27:35.510
And it's not drugs, what is it?

27:35.546 --> 27:37.012
No definitive answer yet.

27:37.047 --> 27:38.687
How did sara ravenscroft
end up like this?

27:38.716 --> 27:42.217
Well, this is her chest ct.

27:45.222 --> 27:47.556
Multiple lesions.
They're too small.

27:47.591 --> 27:48.990
To have shown up
on previous xrays.

27:49.026 --> 27:50.592
Wow, the disease is extensive.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.360
It could be tb,
it could be cancer.

27:52.396 --> 27:54.196
I'm just waiting
on her biopsy results.

27:54.231 --> 27:55.764
Okay, well, I'll call the lab,

27:55.799 --> 27:57.365
See if I can get them
to speed it up.

27:57.401 --> 28:00.102
Thank you.

28:04.274 --> 28:05.874
Let's just wait and see.

28:07.611 --> 28:11.413
We got a problem.
They've come to take sara.

28:11.448 --> 28:13.426
I took care of atlanta general.
No, not atlanta general.

28:13.450 --> 28:17.085
Her parents are here, with their
doctor and their private jet.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.056
<i>Look, we can't let them
take her.</i>

28:21.091 --> 28:23.892
Sara is their daughter.

28:23.927 --> 28:26.228
<i>And since she can't speak
for herself,</i>

28:26.263 --> 28:28.641
They get to decide her course of
treatment and where she has it.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.976
Okay, but they want
to medicate her.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.533
And put her in
a psychiatric facility.

28:31.568 --> 28:33.401
That is not what is best
for sara.

28:33.437 --> 28:35.704
What if you're both wrong?

28:35.739 --> 28:37.939
What if her respiratory issues
and her mental health.

28:37.975 --> 28:40.308
Are unrelated, and what if
she is schizophrenic?

28:40.344 --> 28:42.255
What if we're right and her two
issues are connected?

28:42.279 --> 28:44.913
All I'm asking for is
a little bit more time.

28:44.948 --> 28:46.826
If we can really figure out
what's wrong with sara.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.383
And cure her,

28:48.418 --> 28:50.258
Think about how much more
financially grateful.

28:50.287 --> 28:52.454
The ravenscrofts will be
to chastain and to you.

28:54.591 --> 28:57.759
Okay.

28:57.795 --> 29:01.263
Okay. Ii can buy you,
I don't know, maybe an hour.

29:01.298 --> 29:03.565
But the minute they demand it,

29:03.600 --> 29:05.934
I have to discharge her.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.618
Forgive me for the delay.
Um, please take a seat.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.387
We're fine, thank you.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.055
When can we see her, doctor?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.758
Well, iin addition to her
mental disorientation,

29:21.793 --> 29:24.260
Your daughter had bleeding
in her lungs.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.162
And we've identified the lesion,

29:26.198 --> 29:27.831
Which we're cauterizing
as we speak.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.566
So it shouldn't be
too much longer.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.079
The bleeding in her lungs,
is it serious?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.569
For someone her age,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.772
It's probably from a bronchitis
or pneumonia.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.685
Soon as she's back in savannah,
I'll have a pulmonologist.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.142
Assess her while we treat her.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.777
For the schizophrenia
concurrently.

29:40.812 --> 29:43.179
We will need copies
of all of her records.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.625
And tests from tonight.
Yeah, of course.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.082
Now, are you... are you confident.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.650
With the schizophrenia
diagnosis?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.597
We've had her diagnosed
by the best in the field.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.023
Would you object to sharing
that physician's name with me?

29:53.058 --> 29:55.258
Do you have any idea
what it's like.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.428
To watch the child that you love
just fade away.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.330
Piece by piece, dr. Bell?

30:00.365 --> 30:03.099
We're supposed to protect
our children.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.936
It almost killed me that I
couldn't protect her from this.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.705
But now,
sara can't speak for herself.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.442
So we finally have
the legal power.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.788
To do something about
her condition.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.879
We've waited a long time.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.547
To get her mental
disorder treated.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.450
I'm in no mood
for further delays.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.188
You know, I did some research.

30:25.223 --> 30:28.291
On cellular memory
and transplants. -

30:28.326 --> 30:30.627
As it turns out,
there is a reason for you.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.695
To be concerned about
your heart donor.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.798
I found some studies
out of singapore showing that.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.567
The human heart can actually
store memory.

30:37.602 --> 30:40.703
Through combinatorial coding
of nerve cells.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.739
Seriously?

30:42.774 --> 30:45.909
There was one case,
where an engineer in iowa.

30:45.944 --> 30:48.978
Received a murderer's heart and
stabbed his buddy in the head.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.313
With an ice pick.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.348
Wait, wait a minute.
Are you sure?

30:52.384 --> 30:55.852
Yeah. In another case, a
godfearing high school teacher.

30:55.887 --> 30:59.522
From conyers, georgia received
the heart of a car thief,

30:59.558 --> 31:02.058
And suddenly fabricated
medical symptoms.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.661
Just to get his doctor
to go out with him.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.763
One can only wonder what
perverted intentions.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.665
He had in mind.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.901
So I wanted to go out with you.
You lied.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.337
Yes, but, my brain wanted to do
the right thing.

31:14.372 --> 31:18.374
My criminal heart held it
hostage. I'm sorry.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.113
I like you. All right?

31:23.148 --> 31:25.014
I know you're a good man.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.017
But I don't date patients.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.419
My career is my focus.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.287
Anything else is
an unnecessary distraction.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.289
What you want, I can't give.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.691
I don't believe that.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.959
Believe it.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.360
And if you try
to prove otherwise,

31:37.395 --> 31:38.862
I will guarantee you one thing.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.697
I will break
your brandnew heart.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.800
I'll risk it. Turns out
they're replaceable.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.635
Good night, micah.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.537
You're weakening. I'm not.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.373
Yes, you are. Yes, you are...
Hey, wait.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.442
Hey. My heart just
skipped a beat.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.081
It just skipped another one.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.252
Come on, you're killing me.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.088
You can't just leave me here.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.465
Any progress?
I'm missing a puzzle piece.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.000
I just don't know what it is.

32:18.203 --> 32:21.237
What if we can't
diagnose her in time?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.506
Then we go to plan b.
Try to get through to sara.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.702
Get her lucid enough to make
her own medical decisions.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.014
Sara?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.882
Sara.

32:36.454 --> 32:41.257
Hey. Hey,
I brought you something.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.760
These are tidal marshes.
You painted this.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.195
It has your name right there.

32:46.731 --> 32:49.799
You're very talented, sara.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.212
Nic has a great eye.
If it weren't for her,

32:51.236 --> 32:53.703
I'd still have bruce lee posters
on my walls.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.173
Look, there's this one, too.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.675
See?

33:05.016 --> 33:07.951
Sara?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.652
Sara?

33:11.489 --> 33:12.789
Blood pressure's dropping.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.458
Give her a 500cc bolus.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.573
There's blood in her urine.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.231
Disorientation, ear infection,
pulmonary bleeding...

33:21.266 --> 33:23.733
Lung lesions, hematuria...

33:24.703 --> 33:27.003
Any skin lesions?

33:36.214 --> 33:38.081
Hey.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.417
I'll call the lab.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.888
How will we know if we're right?

33:45.924 --> 33:47.357
You'll see it in the blood.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.758
Reminder,
I'm a nurse practitioner,

33:48.793 --> 33:49.859
Not a histopathologist.

33:49.894 --> 33:51.027
You don't have to be.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.161
You'll see.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.197
Chris, can you put it up?

33:57.769 --> 34:00.837
Wow. -See the staining pattern
of the granular white cells?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.506
Antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.341
Sara has wegener's.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.277
I'vei've read about it,
I've just never seen it.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.612
The disease attacks blood
vessels in multiple organs.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.559
I've never seen it attack
blood vessels in a brain,

34:11.583 --> 34:12.614
But it makes sense.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.083
It explains the psychosis.

34:15.453 --> 34:16.886
What?

34:16.920 --> 34:20.023
Schizophrenia is not curable,
but this is.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.525
I mean, that's news
any family would pray for.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.030
We can treat her.
If she hasn't been discharged.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.460
Sara has a very rare
autoimmune disease.

34:32.496 --> 34:33.928
Called wegener's.

34:33.964 --> 34:35.541
It's what caused the bleeding
in her lungs and kidneys.

34:35.565 --> 34:38.800
Which also, likely, caused
her erratic behavior,

34:38.835 --> 34:41.202
Making her seem mentally ill
when she wasn't.

34:41.237 --> 34:45.473
You understand how we still find
this news hard to believe.

34:45.509 --> 34:47.074
The biopsy results.

34:47.110 --> 34:48.810
Confirm the diagnosis, lawrence.

34:48.844 --> 34:50.311
The doctors are right.

34:50.347 --> 34:51.980
She isn't schizophrenic.

34:52.014 --> 34:53.648
Look, given the lack of research.

34:53.683 --> 34:55.550
On wegener's affecting
the brain this way,

34:55.585 --> 34:56.929
You know, I'm not surprised
sara was misdiagnosed.

34:56.953 --> 34:58.486
At that early stage.

34:58.522 --> 35:00.155
She's being
treated with medication.

35:00.190 --> 35:01.856
To stop the body
from attacking itself,

35:01.892 --> 35:03.358
But it may take hours.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.160
Before we see any change.
Dear god.

35:05.195 --> 35:07.562
We almost had her committed.

35:07.597 --> 35:09.898
She could have died.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.870
What if she never forgives us?

35:28.451 --> 35:29.717
The surgery was successful.

35:29.753 --> 35:30.885
Your face is gonna be fine.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.921
It'll heal without a scar.

35:36.226 --> 35:37.792
You seem stressed.

35:37.827 --> 35:39.594
Your parents.

35:39.629 --> 35:41.229
Are they still here?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.698
It's that obvious? Yeah.

35:43.733 --> 35:46.067
Hey, you know what I think?

35:46.102 --> 35:48.369
No, and I know that's not
gonna stop you from telling me.

35:48.405 --> 35:49.749
I think your father's
not the only one.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.139
With money and pride issues.

35:51.174 --> 35:53.308
I think it's you, too. Yeah.

35:53.343 --> 35:55.543
I think that you're anxious
that your inlaws.

35:55.579 --> 35:57.946
Won't think
your family measures up.

35:57.981 --> 36:01.049
Excuse me? -Hey, bro, listen,
I get it, man, I get it.

36:01.084 --> 36:03.318
Ii'mi'm the kid
of immigrants, too, all right?

36:03.353 --> 36:08.756
Ii know how it feels to... To
be embarrassed by your parents.

36:10.527 --> 36:12.493
God...

36:12.529 --> 36:14.996
When I was in high school,
I would just get so frustrated,

36:15.031 --> 36:16.631
You know,
that they couldn't grasp.

36:16.666 --> 36:19.167
Simple western mores. Yeah.

36:19.202 --> 36:22.737
You got it worse than me; Your
dad's just a cab driver, so...

36:22.772 --> 36:24.339
Dude, you have no idea
about my dad.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.141
Folks hear the accent,

36:27.177 --> 36:28.776
And assume
that he's beneath them.

36:28.812 --> 36:33.248
They have no idea that
he is a selfmade entrepreneur.

36:33.283 --> 36:34.983
That he speaks three languages.

36:35.018 --> 36:38.419
Not to mention the courage
and the confidence it took him.

36:38.455 --> 36:42.657
To uproot his family and start
all over in another country.

36:42.692 --> 36:45.960
Hey. I don't think
I could do it.

36:48.565 --> 36:51.199
Your parents?

36:51.234 --> 36:54.269
They sound great.

36:55.739 --> 36:57.171
Yeah.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.476
Yeah, they are.

37:05.749 --> 37:08.483
Okay, get some rest. Yeah.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.185
And, for the record, you're
not so bad at talking to people.

37:12.722 --> 37:14.789
You ever consider
a career in psychotherapy?

37:14.824 --> 37:16.791
No, no, no. Too pretty.

37:16.826 --> 37:18.693
You know,
but if the looks fade, maybe.

37:18.728 --> 37:20.528
Channing. Ha.

37:20.563 --> 37:21.863
Ready to get back to work?

37:21.898 --> 37:23.175
I got to go check on my parents.

37:23.199 --> 37:26.034
Is your tuxedo pressed?

37:26.069 --> 37:28.169
Don't tell me
they're at the fundraiser.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.238
Okay. I won't.

37:30.273 --> 37:32.307
But conrad says they are.

37:40.183 --> 37:41.382
I have to say,

37:41.418 --> 37:43.418
Your sari is stunning,

37:43.453 --> 37:45.053
And such a breath of fresh air.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.755
This traditional indian dress
is really very simple.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.524
An untailored length of cloth.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.359
And yet, so elegant.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.760
Traditionally, the sari was seen.

37:52.796 --> 37:56.898
As a sign of purity,
because cloth, when cut,

37:56.933 --> 37:58.933
And pierced with needles,
was impure.

37:58.968 --> 38:00.068
Fascinating.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.336
You know, I love to travel.

38:01.371 --> 38:03.004
I'll have to put india
on my bucket list.

38:03.039 --> 38:05.707
I wanted
to thank you personally.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.275
For your support of chastain.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.177
Perhaps I could give you a tour,

38:09.212 --> 38:11.624
Let you see where your generous
donation gets put to good work.

38:11.648 --> 38:13.581
Donation? Dr. Hunter,

38:13.616 --> 38:15.383
I'm sorry for the confusion.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.585
These are my... Parents.
I'm tejan pravesh,

38:17.620 --> 38:19.887
And this is my wife himaya.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.956
Devon is our son.

38:21.991 --> 38:23.591
S... I'm so sorry.

38:23.626 --> 38:25.927
I was told that you were
in the telecom business.

38:25.962 --> 38:29.030
Ii'm in... Transportation.

38:29.065 --> 38:31.933
My father owns his own cab.

38:31.968 --> 38:33.901
He put me through medical school.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.937
Working seven days a week,
very long hours,

38:35.972 --> 38:38.072
And I'm very proud of him.

38:38.108 --> 38:41.309
You know, ii don't
have any children of my own,

38:41.344 --> 38:43.778
But if I did, I would hope
they'd be as proud of me.

38:43.813 --> 38:46.447
As devon is of you.

38:46.483 --> 38:50.284
Really, such
a pleasure to meet you both.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.587
If you'll excuse me. Of course.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.892
Ii'm sorry we couldn't spend
more time together,

38:57.927 --> 38:59.460
But we had a lovely evening.

38:59.496 --> 39:02.330
I hope we weren't
too much in the way.

39:02.365 --> 39:06.634
No, i... I owe
you both an apology.

39:06.669 --> 39:08.503
I was...

39:08.538 --> 39:13.274
I was very dismissive of you
and your feelings at dinner.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.277
No... I was wrong to ask
about priya's parents.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.146
No, you weren't.

39:19.783 --> 39:21.649
They've wanted to come visit,

39:21.684 --> 39:22.917
And I've been pushing back.

39:22.952 --> 39:25.086
I was...

39:25.121 --> 39:27.088
I was...

39:27.123 --> 39:28.923
I was worried about...

39:30.727 --> 39:32.104
I was worried
that they were gonna take.

39:32.128 --> 39:33.828
Creative control of the wedding.

39:33.863 --> 39:35.441
But it's more than that;
I just didn't know.

39:35.465 --> 39:38.933
If you all were gonna get along.

39:38.968 --> 39:42.203
But I think it's important
that we all meet,

39:42.238 --> 39:47.108
And wewe... We honor
family traditions on both sides.

39:47.143 --> 39:49.777
We would like that very much.

39:49.813 --> 39:50.878
Yeah?

39:50.914 --> 39:52.914
Good.

40:34.791 --> 40:37.492
Dad?

40:37.527 --> 40:39.527
Veronica.

40:44.968 --> 40:46.234
Mom?

40:46.269 --> 40:48.202
Sara.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.706
Baby. Honey?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.076
Darling...

40:55.111 --> 40:57.745
No. No.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.547
- It's okay.
- No. No, no. Shh...

40:59.582 --> 41:01.916
I'm not going.
No, stop. No, please, stop.

41:01.951 --> 41:03.885
Get away from me!

41:03.920 --> 41:05.419
Help me, please! I'm not going.
Sara!

41:05.455 --> 41:07.121
Sara. I'm not going.

41:07.156 --> 41:08.756
Get away from me.

41:08.791 --> 41:10.424
Sara, sara, it's okay,
I'm nurse nevin.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.527
Look at me.
You're fine, you're safe.

41:12.562 --> 41:13.973
They want to put me away,
they think I'm crazy.

41:13.997 --> 41:15.463
No one's gonna
put you away, sara,

41:15.498 --> 41:17.632
Because you're not mentally
You hear that?

41:17.667 --> 41:19.267
You're not crazy.

41:19.302 --> 41:20.412
You have an autoimmune disease.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.370
That's been untreated
for a long time.

41:22.405 --> 41:24.272
And the medicine
that they're giving you now,

41:24.307 --> 41:25.740
It's reversing the disease.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.475
You were right, sara.

41:27.510 --> 41:28.809
We were wrong.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.780
I'm really gonna be okay?

41:32.815 --> 41:34.081
Yes.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.752
Honey.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.823
We are so sorry.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.060
We're so very sorry.

41:46.095 --> 41:48.062
It's okay, mom.

41:58.875 --> 42:01.642
Nnurse nevin?

42:01.678 --> 42:03.811
Um, doctor?

42:03.846 --> 42:06.247
Thank you both.

42:06.282 --> 42:09.450
I...

42:09.485 --> 42:11.285
Thank you.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.132
Well, we're just happy
you're all together again.

42:13.156 --> 42:15.456
And I better get an invite
to your next opening.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.525
I'll do better than that.

42:18.962 --> 42:21.495
I'll paint something
just for you.

42:21.531 --> 42:24.298
I'd love that.

42:47.557 --> 42:48.889
Maybe now isn't a good time.

42:48.925 --> 42:50.691
To ask them
to open their checkbook.

42:50.727 --> 42:52.994
It's not always about the money.

42:55.498 --> 42:57.732
I'll wait a few days.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.736
A few days?

43:01.771 --> 43:03.404
He'll be back before lunch.
