00:17.640 --> 00:18.680
[sniffs]

00:22.160 --> 00:23.560
[Luke laughs] Oh, God.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.000
Thirty years in a barrel
and it still tastes like whiskey.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
I'm sorry, that is the real problem here.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.880
You're not doing it right.
You've gotta smell it and then taste it.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
See what it makes you think of.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.520
It mostly just reminds me
of really strong alcohol.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.800
Is this the one?

00:36.880 --> 00:39.920
I think the one we liked
was smokier maybe?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.680
Oh. Why couldn't you and Mal
have bonded over a perky little rosé?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.360
[Dylan] I have to say I'm impressed.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.000
You used to freak out about birthdays
and now you're back here

00:48.080 --> 00:50.520
hunting down the very first whiskey
that you drank together,

00:50.600 --> 00:54.080
to have on your wedding day.
Face it. You're a romantic.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.200
We haven't drunk this much whiskey
since the Tech Awards.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.600
- Were we drinking whiskey?
- You were for sure.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.040
Shit. Isabel.
I left her off the list.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.280
[Luke] Yeah. Isabel.
What ever happened to her?

01:04.360 --> 01:06.040
[Dylan] I don't know.
She was always so busy

01:06.120 --> 01:08.440
- and then I was busy and...
- Boys, focus.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.120
Okay? We've got a lot more tasting to do.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.000
We're not leaving here
until I've found the one.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.600
God, you're starting to sound like Dylan.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.600
I'm actually...
I'm feeling a little bit peaky.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.280
Is it okay if I switch up
on to rosé, please?

01:18.360 --> 01:19.720
- To take the edge off?
- [laughs]

01:19.800 --> 01:21.400
- I'm sorry... What!
- [laughs]

01:21.480 --> 01:22.800
I don't care. I'm doing it anyway.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.120
We should catch the coach soon
or we'll be stuck for the night.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.440
We don't do this enough.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.560
We should keep hold of it.
Promise me?

01:41.200 --> 01:45.240
[sighs deeply] Right. That old dude
at the bar says that this is his favorite

01:45.320 --> 01:48.880
and he looks like he's only drunk whiskey
for the last, like, 100 years, so...

01:59.360 --> 02:00.720
I think this is the one.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
- [sighs] Finally!
- [Dylan] Really?

02:02.880 --> 02:05.520
Not just 'cause
we have to catch the coach?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.800
Yeah. This is it.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.479
Amen to that.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
[indistinct chatter]

02:20.600 --> 02:23.080
Things like this make me feel like...
I don't know,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.680
like I...
I really don't have my shit together.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.960
Uh, you don't, dude.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.280
[Dylan] I mean these people
might win awards tonight

02:29.360 --> 02:31.040
for being great at what they do.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.280
They have, like, a thing that they do,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.480
[stammers] and they're good at it,
and they take pride in it.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.320
Well, not necessarily.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.520
What do you mean?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.440
There's more than one path to a statuette.
That's all I'm saying.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.960
To the sweet, sweet taste
of victory, dear boy.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.200
How do you know that you'll win?

02:46.280 --> 02:48.680
These awards are notorious
for jury tampering and corruption,

02:48.760 --> 02:50.080
which is terrible, obviously.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.880
[whispers] Unless you're the one
doing the tampering.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.400
I thought we were here to celebrate
your hard-won achievement?

02:55.480 --> 02:57.760
It is an achievement.
It's an achievement in bribery.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.480
It's, uh... Listen, it's all good fun.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.840
Seriously, I've schmoozed.
I've earned this.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.320
- Incoming!
- Ooh!

03:03.400 --> 03:04.800
It's the award
for Best Front-End Development...

03:04.880 --> 03:05.960
In a freemium app.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.400
- Samuels. McNeish! Mandy!
- [laughing]

03:09.480 --> 03:11.800
Okay, everyone
on your best behavior, right?

03:13.600 --> 03:14.920
For those of you who haven't met him,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.080
Alexander Walker
is one of our principal investors.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.040
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you for my salary.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.400
- Do you want some MDMA?
- Okay, let's get you a drink, man.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.000
Lots to get excited about tonight.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.880
Yeah, actually, I need to, uh, catch up
with some familiar faces.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.680
So, good luck.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.040
- All right?
- Oh, hi.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.200
- I'm Jonno.
- Yeah. No, I do remember you, Jonno.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.760
I find it's fifty-fifty with people.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.080
How's it going?

03:50.160 --> 03:52.080
You got stuck on top
of any more hospitals or...

03:52.160 --> 03:55.280
No, I prop open every door now.
Drives my girlfriend crazy.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.440
Oh. Well, I'm glad you found someone.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.640
We have sex three times a week.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
Wow.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.520
Don't always do everything.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.440
Well, I'm...
I'm glad it worked out for you.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.320
I was in a rut, so...
I changed job,

04:13.400 --> 04:15.880
got a girlfriend,
and now I'm winning an award.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.920
Best Front-End Development
of a Freemium App.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.279
I'm loving life, Edie!

04:21.360 --> 04:23.040
- Well, it's... it's Evie.
- [sighs]

04:23.120 --> 04:24.600
- No, no, no!
- All right, guys?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.680
We're not your guys anymore.
We're strange men.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.200
Strangers, Sam, it's not strange men.
But his point remains.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.600
Jonno, you betrayed us.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.000
You're like Judas, only much worse.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
- I just took a different job.
- [mimicking]

04:37.160 --> 04:38.360
Doing what's right for me.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.920
Forget it, boys.
He's not worth it.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.720
- You stop consorting with the enemy.
- Sorry.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.200
Seriously, Evie,
how do you think it makes me feel,

04:48.280 --> 04:49.680
- seeing you with...
- [Evie] Sorry!

04:49.760 --> 04:50.880
Unbelievable!

04:50.960 --> 04:53.280
We've found our table.
We're there.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.360
No... that can't be right.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.840
Check if you want.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.760
- You all right?
- They seat the winners at the front

05:04.840 --> 05:07.680
so people don't have to wait ages
while they walk back from the podium.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.560
A table at the back almost always means...

05:12.640 --> 05:13.920
We may have a problem with the award

05:14.000 --> 05:15.600
for Best Front-End Development
in a Freemium App.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.840
That's the award that Jonno's winning.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.880
Evie, speaking very slowly
and precisely

05:22.960 --> 05:25.240
with no ambiguous phrases
or foreign words...

05:26.160 --> 05:28.080
What the fuck?

05:28.160 --> 05:29.960
Jonno said that
he was winning that award.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.480
- He seemed... pretty confident about it.
- Tell me everything you know.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.360
There's nothing much,
just he's doing all right.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.040
- He's got a girlfriend...
- [scoffs] Yeah, right.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.640
He likes his job...

05:43.560 --> 05:45.280
[Samuels] Interesting.
That's Wendy.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.840
Give me more, Samuels.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.440
- Open that beautiful mind of yours.
- She went skiing last year.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.520
I saw it on Facebook.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.880
She didn't like the moguls.
She strongly liked the hot wine.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.360
A mogul is a bump in the snow.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.040
Some people like to ski around bumps.
Not Wendy.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.960
Someone took a photo of her afterwards.
Her dad! He took it.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.800
He put a photo of her on Facebook.
You commented on it.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.120
- Me? Why?
- You said it looked...

06:03.200 --> 06:04.920
[laughs] like a bumpy ride.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.480
He, uh, liked the comment,
uh, with a thumb up.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.920
- Her dad's Charles Ashton!
- [gasps]

06:12.000 --> 06:15.080
She's Wendy Ashton! [Chuckles]

06:15.160 --> 06:17.840
The fact they share the same surname
didn't help you make the connection?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.160
[exhales deeply] Oh,
Jonno, you sly bastard.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.800
Charles Ashton's on the awards jury.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.200
I played golf with him
three times this month.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.040
I don't even know how to play golf!
I made it up.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.440
- We're dead meat, aren't we?
- No, we're very much alive meat.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.320
- So what's the plan?
- Go and get a drink.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.760
- I'll take care of this, boys.
- Man... with a plan.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.600
Plan on it!
Go! Drink! Precelebrate! [Chuckles]

06:39.680 --> 06:41.040
You guys hang back.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.600
Okay, what's the plan?
I've got literally nothing.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.720
What makes you so sure
you're not actually gonna win?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.120
Yes, good.
You determine that.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.200
- What? How?
- I don't know. You suggested it.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.440
Evie, I think it's time
you had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.320
Uh, no, I never actually
went out with Jonno.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.960
Really? You sure?
You never dated him?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.480
- No. Never.
- I distinctly remember...

06:57.560 --> 06:59.480
Okay, well, maybe
now's a good time to seduce him

06:59.560 --> 07:01.080
and extract a little pillow talk, huh?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.960
Well, I could just talk to him.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.240
I don't think it will be
half as effective,

07:04.320 --> 07:05.440
but if it's all you can offer me, fine.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.360
Chop-chop, Dyl.
We're on the clock. Let's go.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.840
Okay, fine. But I want you
to have really low expectations

07:09.920 --> 07:11.320
of me actually succeeding.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.200
They're coming down from really certain
to absolute certainty of success.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.600
Uh, what are you gonna do?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.360
[sighs]

07:17.440 --> 07:20.440
Well, I've assigned all the main tasks.
I might as well go get a drink.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.080
- [Isabel] Can I get you something to eat?
- Sorry?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.320
People hanging around here

07:34.400 --> 07:36.920
are usually just trying to
jump in early on the canapés.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.640
[stammers] Oh, no, I'm just...

07:38.720 --> 07:40.200
Uh... I'm...

07:41.320 --> 07:44.480
There is something, though.
Could... could I just get backstage?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.960
- That's staff only.
- Yeah, I just...

07:47.040 --> 07:49.440
I want to sneak a look
at the award winners in the envelopes.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.240
[chuckles]

07:51.320 --> 07:54.400
- You're very upfront about the cheating.
- Yeah.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.040
Have you got a bet riding on it
or something?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.600
Something like that.
Can you help?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.000
Thanks for doing this.
It's really kind.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.360
The organizers' room has
a thumbprint ID and CCTV entry system.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.560
- Fuck!
- Kidding. It's just a room.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.600
[indistinct chatter]

08:19.200 --> 08:21.640
Excuse me... uh, sorry.
Uh, can I have a word?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.960
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no problem.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.600
I would like to preempt any sexual tension
by reminding you I do have a girlfriend.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.920
So... it's a no.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.960
- Yeah.
- It's probably a no.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.480
- Okay.
- I mean... could ask her?

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
Nah.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.679
[both chuckle nervously]

08:40.760 --> 08:42.360
How did you meet Wendy?

08:42.440 --> 08:43.840
Classic story.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.320
Bit of grinding at a nightclub,
Facebook afterwards. Bang. Love.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.960
So, why did you choose her
out of all of the girls in the city?

08:51.040 --> 08:53.120
Was there something special about her?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.120
There is something special about her.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.680
- Oh, yeah?
- She's kind.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.840
And she believes in me.
And I believe in me.

09:01.920 --> 09:05.560
And so now loads of people
are on board with believing in the Jonno.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.880
So you weren't just using her
to get to the awards?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.680
Are you getting on with that fella
you were hung up on?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.680
- [stutters] What, Dylan?
- Make your move yet?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.280
Nope. [Chuckles]

09:18.360 --> 09:20.360
- You lost interest?
- Nope. [Chuckles]

09:20.440 --> 09:22.920
- You chickened out?
- Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.240
Being single's not so bad.
You get bought lots of drinks.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.920
It's a free bar tonight.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.520
I mean, generally.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.200
You couldn't pay me to be single again.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.480
[both chuckle]

09:34.200 --> 09:36.160
[whispers] It will happen.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.080
- [yawns]
- Long day?

09:48.160 --> 09:51.120
When I do an event like this
my Saturdays are, like, 20 hours long.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.520
- Isn't that illegal?
- You're asking the right girl!

09:53.600 --> 09:54.880
Or you will be.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.280
I, uh, I'm saving to train as a lawyer.
You know, I wanna do human rights.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.200
Uh, but to get there, first
I must trample on my own. [Chuckles]

10:02.280 --> 10:03.560
- [chuckles]
- It's fine, I can...

10:03.640 --> 10:05.840
- I can sleep it off on Monday.
- Why not tomorrow?

10:05.920 --> 10:09.200
Oh, 'cause on Sundays
I do pro bono work for a women's refuge.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.280
Got to build up that CV. [Chuckles]

10:11.360 --> 10:13.440
I'm exhausted
just listening to your schedule.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.680
Feel free to tip heavily
at the end of the night.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.680
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

10:19.720 --> 10:23.120
- Are we... are we all right?
- I don't want to spoil your fun but, um...

10:23.200 --> 10:25.720
I don't think anyone cares
that we're in here. [Chuckles]

10:25.800 --> 10:26.800
[chuckles]

10:26.880 --> 10:28.600
- We should probably get a move on.
- Yeah.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.600
They get beady if their staff go missing
and... I need this job.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.760
Along with all the other ones.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.200
Yeah. [Chuckles]

10:38.080 --> 10:39.880
It's cool you know what you wanna do.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.480
If I'd figured it out sooner,
I could have studied at uni, but...

10:42.560 --> 10:44.160
better late than never.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.560
- [stammers] How did you...
- Ah!

10:46.640 --> 10:47.920
Here we are.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.560
Yep.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.240
And the winner is...

10:57.720 --> 10:58.840
Not Luke.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.080
Hey, can we get this guy
some mini hamburgers please?

11:05.080 --> 11:07.960
And some mini quiches as well.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.720
You know what?
Just bring him a lot of small food.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.880
[chuckles] Yes.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.840
We have a great developer team,
we really do.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.040
I mean, they're...
they're very, very award-winning.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.520
Yeah, well, we'll shortly see if
other people share your opinion, won't we?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.160
[chuckles] That's true.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.800
[inhales sharply] Although, you know...

11:29.880 --> 11:33.600
to even be nominated in this category
really is a huge deal.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.640
Right?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.240
Yeah.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.800
- [woman] Thank you.
- What can I get you, sir?

11:43.880 --> 11:46.400
I'd like a beer, please.
And a lot more advice.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.120
Oh, Dylan, I'm sorry...
but they'll get really pissed off

11:49.200 --> 11:51.040
if I have
a long conversation with a guest.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.240
I'd like to talk.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.800
I really would, but um...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.840
- What if I helped?
- If you helped?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.920
What are you... Dylan...

12:01.840 --> 12:03.520
I want what you've got
with your law stuff.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.760
That thing of, you know,
doing something you really love.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.080
That sounds great.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.640
Okay, well,
welcome to the catering industry.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.000
Does this feel like your calling?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.200
[both chuckle]

12:18.880 --> 12:20.640
[guests laughing]

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
- Music.
- Headphones.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.520
- Food.
- Chewing.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
- Cars.
- Pollution.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.760
- Lacrosse.
- Lacrosse.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.560
Sorry,
lacrosse makes me think of lacrosse.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.720
- No thinking, no questions. Art.
- Uh, gallery.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.240
- Hunting.
- Unicorns.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.640
- Sorry.
- [laughs] It's all right.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.360
[both laughing]

12:37.440 --> 12:39.600
- Sorry. Uh, gardens.
- Lovely.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.720
You find gardens lovely?

12:41.320 --> 12:44.880
Yeah, the...
You know, the smell of freshly cut grass.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.960
Things changing through the seasons.
That's... lovely.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.280
- Have you thought about the SAS?
- [chuckles]

12:51.520 --> 12:54.360
Or maybe just landscape gardening?

12:56.360 --> 12:58.600
- Could I do that?
- Why not?

12:59.160 --> 13:01.280
I'm actually really excited by that idea.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.600
- There you are then.
- [laughs] Could it be that simple?

13:05.440 --> 13:08.520
Does everything have to be complicated?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.120
- Hey.
- What can I get you?

13:11.200 --> 13:14.120
- What are you doing?
- I'm pouring you a drink.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.960
I find you...

13:20.080 --> 13:21.600
very confusing.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.400
[clears throat]

13:30.800 --> 13:32.440
Oh. All right, guys?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.080
So Jonno just appeared in your life,
did he, Wendy?

13:35.160 --> 13:38.280
Like Father Christmas,
only real... and called Jonno?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.000
- What?
- Two words for your lady.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.920
Charles and Daddy.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.320
Daddy's in the same industry,
so we had a lot in common.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.160
- It doesn't add up.
- Are these friends of yours?

13:47.240 --> 13:49.240
Oh, we're all friends here, Wendy.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.960
We all want the same things. Love...

13:52.040 --> 13:55.280
The award for Best Front-End Development
in a Freemium App.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.400
I'm starting to freak out.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.040
Wendy, far be it for me to predict
any of the night's big results,

13:59.120 --> 14:02.920
but one hears things and,
well, boys, lay it out for the lady.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.040
Wendy, you are linked to Charles.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.640
Yes, because I'm his daughter.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.000
And you like hot wine,
but not when the snow's bumpy.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.640
- And you're a Virgo...
- Jonno used you

14:10.720 --> 14:12.360
to get to your father to get to the award

14:12.440 --> 14:14.840
for Best Front-End Development
in a Freemium App!

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
- Dad's not on the jury this year.
- What?

14:17.400 --> 14:18.520
I met Wendy grinding!

14:19.560 --> 14:20.840
At a club.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.280
It was our third date
before I realized who her dad was.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.200
If we win it,
it's because we're good at it.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.440
You bunch of tits!

14:31.160 --> 14:33.160
That was a masterclass, Luke.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.200
- [chuckles]
- We've lost.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.800
Yeah, but the way you handled it
was masterful.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.440
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd take your seats,

14:40.520 --> 14:42.400
tonight's awards will begin
in five minutes.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.880
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.080
- Amen to that, brother.
- I had it all planned out.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.800
Life doesn't work that way.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.480
I hope it gets better.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.560
If I sit here all night, I'm gonna lose.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.040
Luke, you have lost.
Just sit down.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.280
It's not over. There's still
one thing left I haven't tried.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.760
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats

15:31.840 --> 15:33.400
for tonight's ceremony.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.040
[indistinct chatter]

15:54.840 --> 15:58.160
This is great! I feel like just
going out there and, I don't know...

15:58.240 --> 15:59.480
buying a trowel!

15:59.560 --> 16:03.880
Yes! From one of the many late night
garden shops in the city center.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.840
I could carry around secateurs
and get a feel for pruning.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.720
Go. Go and find them.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.840
Yeah, I think I might just stay, actually,
and rule out being a barman forever.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.640
For... just a little while longer.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.080
- What's this all about?
- Believe me, this is the nuclear option.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.720
Hey, you can't kill me. [Stammers]
Witnesses saw me leaving with you.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.600
I'm not gonna kill you, Jonno.
It's much worse than that.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.040
For me.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.600
Oh, no.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.520
I'm flattered, Luke,
but I've got a girlfriend now.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.240
I am down on my knees,
and I am begging you to please...

16:46.160 --> 16:47.400
let us win that award.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.560
Yeah, when I worked for you
at Volcano Media it was always about you.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.760
Well, tonight's about me...
[whispers] Jonno.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.080
Not about you... Luke.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.560
You're gonna have to deal with that.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.760
Tonight's not about either of us, Jonno.
It's about Samuels and McNeish and Mandy.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.119
The investors wanna make cuts.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.000
They wanna outsource
the front-end development team.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.720
- They're gonna get rid of them.
- McNeish called me a much worse Judas.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.160
All right? That's not very nice.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.079
He's angry you left
because we were a family.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.520
I thought that
if we won the award, then...

17:14.599 --> 17:17.040
it'd be an award-winning team.
It'd add value.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
It'd keep them safe.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.880
- Why would I help you?
- Because...

17:23.920 --> 17:26.880
Because you're a much nicer guy
than I am, Jonno.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.160
If you take your team
out of contention...

17:31.520 --> 17:32.720
they might stand a chance.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.160
[sighs heavily]

17:48.200 --> 17:50.120
[indistinct chatter]

17:57.880 --> 17:59.760
[crowd applauding]

18:07.680 --> 18:10.880
Whatever happens...
you guys are my number one.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.480
Do we get
an engraved plastic trophy for that?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.160
Do you want one?

18:15.240 --> 18:16.840
That would be amazing.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.120
[announcer] Next up...

18:18.200 --> 18:20.080
- Then yes, of course.
- we have the award

18:20.160 --> 18:21.800
for integrated
entertainment experience.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.200
[crowd applauding]

18:25.680 --> 18:27.360
Job well done, Dylan.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.680
Thanks. It's been an education.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.480
- Pleasure schooling you.
- [glasses clink]

18:34.680 --> 18:37.760
So, do you ever think, "What the hell,
I'll just take four minutes off

18:37.840 --> 18:39.440
to have a drink with someone"?

18:39.520 --> 18:40.920
Yeah, it's on my to-do list.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.720
I just think it's...
polite to sort your life out

18:44.800 --> 18:47.360
before you inflict it on someone else.
Don't you think?

18:47.440 --> 18:51.120
Well, um, if you'd consider
making an exception

18:51.200 --> 18:52.440
after this is all over...

18:52.520 --> 18:54.240
It sounds like
you might be asking me on a date.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.720
I would've asked earlier,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.960
but I thought I should sort my life out
before inflicting myself on you.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.200
[chuckles] That's the polite thing to do.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.400
Yeah, I might find half an hour
to fit you in.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.760
- [announcer speaks indistinctly]
- Maybe.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.080
[crowd applauding]

19:12.480 --> 19:13.800
[announcer] Thank you very much.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.240
The next award this evening goes

19:15.320 --> 19:18.800
to the Best Front-End
Development Freemium App.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.760
And the winners are...

19:22.240 --> 19:23.480
Volcano Media!

19:28.520 --> 19:30.680
[crowd cheering and applauding]

19:30.760 --> 19:32.680
[shouting excitedly]

19:34.400 --> 19:35.680
[all cheering]

19:35.760 --> 19:37.520
Go on then, developers.
Go and get it!

19:37.600 --> 19:38.720
Gotta wring out every drop!

19:38.800 --> 19:40.840
[both shouting excitedly]

19:56.840 --> 19:58.840
How did you do it?

20:00.480 --> 20:02.960
I don't know... I took a risk.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.000
Okay, I'll be back in a second.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.440
We will still need to cut costs.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.640
They're an award-winning team now.
That adds value!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.160
One of them offered me MDMA.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.080
It was a gesture.
Unless you want some.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.560
[laughs] It was a joke.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.120
All right, I'll agree to support you
for another six months.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.080
They'll make you proud.
I promise.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.280
Sure.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.200
- You won!
- Ha!

20:38.280 --> 20:40.600
- You didn't even have to...
- Let's not discuss that just now.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.360
- Big night for you!
- Okay, then. All right. [Sighs]

20:44.440 --> 20:45.840
I've got to deliver some thank-yous,

20:45.920 --> 20:48.720
then let's get roaring drunk
on free whiskey.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.880
Yeah, okay, you're already there.
So, just pause.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.440
How did he do it?

20:52.520 --> 20:57.280
Well, he...
said that he took a risk.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.880
Are you all right?
You do sound pretty drunk. [Chuckles]

21:14.760 --> 21:19.920
Whoa. Uh, it's, uh...
kiss-your-friends kind of drunk.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.400
[both chuckle]

21:21.480 --> 21:23.160
What, is that not, um...

21:23.240 --> 21:26.080
- [both chuckle]
- Is that not something that we do?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.960
Not really. [Chuckles nervously]

21:28.040 --> 21:30.920
Oh, okay, um,
I didn't know there were rules.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.640
But fine, I will just... I'll strike it
from the repertoire. [Chuckles]

21:34.720 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, maybe we should just,
you know,

21:37.080 --> 21:39.200
stick to helping each other
throw up tonight.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.680
Yes, that is definitely
on the cards. [Chuckles]

21:42.760 --> 21:45.280
Are you all right?
Do you want me to put you in a cab?

21:45.360 --> 21:48.880
Well, only if you're...
if you're going.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.760
No, I kind of, um... I thought I might
stay around a bit longer.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.600
I kind of made a plan with, um...
But not if you're not all right.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.320
No, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.
You go and find some...

22:00.400 --> 22:02.560
equally sober people
to hang out with. [Chuckles]

22:02.640 --> 22:04.240
All right. [Chuckles]

22:04.320 --> 22:06.680
- I'll check up on you later.
- Okay.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.720
[sighs] You're with a great guy, Wendy.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.920
We didn't deserve him.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.520
I wish we'd made more of him
when he was with us.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.280
- Jonno is great.
- Anytime, Luke.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.280
If I ever need help,
I'll know who to call.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.560
I'll call Jonno.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.080
- I'm Jonno.
- [chuckles]

22:36.920 --> 22:38.320
Fuck.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.000
[groans] Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.400
[sighs]

23:13.200 --> 23:15.120
- Oh, hi!
- Hey.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.040
- Nightcap?
- Absolutely.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.840
Holy shit.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.320
I got a whole case
so we can serve it at the wedding.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.760
Uh... [clears throat]

23:29.440 --> 23:30.680
[chuckles]

23:32.080 --> 23:33.240
[sniffs] Whoa.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.600
Cheers.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.000
- What do you get from it?
- [chuckles]

23:44.080 --> 23:45.400
A mouthful of really good whiskey.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.000
No, what does it make you think of
when you close your eyes?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.640
I don't know.
What do you see?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.640
[grunts] I don't know.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.880
[sniffs]

24:10.280 --> 24:12.800
Honey and shortbread.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.920
[chuckles]
