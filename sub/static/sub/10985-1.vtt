00:27.640 --> 00:30.100
lt all began a very long time ago,

00:30.314 --> 00:34.568
when a merchant ship was set upon
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

00:34.784 --> 00:39.619
A small boy watched helplessly as
his father was killed by the pirate leader,

00:39.839 --> 00:42.049
the Evil Kabai Sengh.

00:42.262 --> 00:44.757
Hejumped overboard
and was washed ashore

00:44.977 --> 00:48.018
on a mysteriousjungle island
called Bengalla.

00:48.236 --> 00:52.572
lt seemed like a case of
''out of the frying pan and into the ire'',

00:52.789 --> 00:56.246
but the Touganda tribesmen
meant the boy no harm.

00:56.466 --> 01:00.054
They scooped him up
and carried him to their village.

01:00.267 --> 01:03.772
And that night, in an ancient
ceremony of ire and drums,

01:03.985 --> 01:09.368
the tribal shaman presented the boy
wlth a ring of great significance.

01:09.583 --> 01:13.457
The boy understood that he was
destined to avenge his father's death

01:13.677 --> 01:18.929
by fighting piracy, greed and cruelty
in all their forms.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.322
When he grew to be a man,
he became the Phantom.

01:38.534 --> 01:41.743
- Damn worthless map!
- You drive, l'll navigate.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.215
- The map is all wrong.
- The map is good, Quill.

01:45.427 --> 01:47.803
Remember its source.
lt can't be wrong.

01:48.017 --> 01:51.938
Then why does it show a bridge back
there? We never crossed any bridge.

01:55.997 --> 01:59.371
- What's he saying, Morgan?
- 'urn around.''

01:59.589 --> 02:02.001
- We'd better turn around.
- Not a chance!

02:02.221 --> 02:05.976
Maybe this little quitter
needs a lesson in positive thinking.

02:13.626 --> 02:16.382
Quill, now l get it.
Turn the map around.

02:16.592 --> 02:21.309
- lt's upside-down, you big moron!
- You big moron!

02:23.611 --> 02:26.950
lf the map is upside-down,
there ought to be a bridge up ahead.

02:27.162 --> 02:29.538
All l see is more jungle.

02:29.752 --> 02:30.952
Oh, shit!

02:44.081 --> 02:49.796
Hey, Quill! No sudden stops.
What's the big idea?

02:50.013 --> 02:53.352
Hey, take a look at that.

02:59.705 --> 03:02.331
- What do you think?.
- l don't know.

03:02.546 --> 03:05.754
lt looks like it'll hold,
but then again...

03:05.972 --> 03:08.182
Breen? Styles?

03:08.395 --> 03:11.234
- l'd hate to bet my life on it, Quill.
- Same here.

03:11.444 --> 03:13.239
OK.

03:13.450 --> 03:16.372
We'll go over on foot.
All except one.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.662
He'll stay back
and drive the truck across.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.292
Yeah, but which one?

03:52.552 --> 03:56.176
- l knew that bridge was safe.
- Come on, kid.

04:00.364 --> 04:01.397
Almost there.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.468
The brake, use the brake!

04:10.599 --> 04:13.177
OK, back in the truck.

04:38.924 --> 04:43.260
Well, it's on foot from here.
OK, Zak, take a look. Which way?.

04:46.777 --> 04:49.736
- What's his problem now?.
- He says we can't go on.

04:49.952 --> 04:53.541
- These woods are protected.
- Oh, yeah? Protected by who?

04:58.057 --> 05:01.396
By a ghost.
'he Ghost Who Walks''.

05:06.078 --> 05:08.074
l wouldn't worry about that.

05:08.292 --> 05:11.334
- He's not taking us beyond this point.
- Shoot him.

05:11.551 --> 05:14.046
No! We may need him.

05:14.266 --> 05:17.356
To drive the truck back
across the bridge!

05:17.567 --> 05:21.701
Tie him up and leave him here.
We can find our own way.

05:33.985 --> 05:37.193
This is it! We're there!

06:06.737 --> 06:09.493
Everybody look around.

06:40.242 --> 06:44.032
Well, you look like an important fella.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.500
Hey, Quill! Up here!

07:07.020 --> 07:10.275
- Got it!
- Mr Drax is going to be very happy.

07:13.704 --> 07:16.378
- What's so important about that thing?
- l don't know.

07:16.587 --> 07:19.842
l don't like to ask Drax questions.
His answers scare me.

07:23.772 --> 07:25.768
Styles!

07:45.788 --> 07:49.959
- What the hell happened?
- He's dead.

07:50.175 --> 07:53.763
The damn thing came alive
and choked him to death.

07:53.976 --> 07:56.436
- lt's not possible!
- Tell Styles.

07:56.650 --> 08:00.440
- Let's get out of here.
- What about all the other stuff?

08:00.661 --> 08:05.746
- There's a lot of valuable junk in here.
- Take it all. Nobody's going to miss it.

08:16.536 --> 08:18.865
Now what?

08:19.084 --> 08:21.876
- Drums.
- l know that! What does it mean?

08:22.092 --> 08:25.549
lt don't mean nothing.
But hurry up, just the same.

08:53.549 --> 08:56.127
Devil, somebody needs us.

09:11.722 --> 09:15.262
This place is really
giving me the creeps.

09:28.683 --> 09:30.845
What the hell is that?

09:31.064 --> 09:32.775
Shoot him!

09:35.284 --> 09:38.289
- Oh, shit!
- Run!

09:44.098 --> 09:46.225
No!

09:54.626 --> 09:57.585
Watch him, Devil.
lf he moves, eat him.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.210
- What about Breen?
- Tough luck. Forget him!

10:38.783 --> 10:41.575
- Who was that guy?.
- Somebody l already killed.

10:41.791 --> 10:45.047
- What?
- You heard me! l killed him years ago.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.469
Guess what? He's back!

10:47.682 --> 10:49.725
At least he's behind us.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.127
Did l get him?

10:59.337 --> 11:01.832
l don't see him.
You must have hit him.

11:29.374 --> 11:31.501
So long, pal!

11:35.056 --> 11:36.256
Keep the truck!

12:09.312 --> 12:11.807
- Ghost Who Walks!
- Oh, yeah.

12:37.637 --> 12:39.966
lt's OK, now.

13:07.924 --> 13:10.966
Hold on. lt'll be all right.

14:03.946 --> 14:06.322
Put them in the guardhouse.

14:09.085 --> 14:11.960
- What have you got here? Poachers?
- Looters, Captain.

14:12.176 --> 14:14.172
Captain, you've got a problem.

14:14.390 --> 14:18.941
You've got a thing out there.
A big, strange-looking thing on a horse.

14:19.153 --> 14:21.909
- With a wolf!
- Get him out of here.

14:23.539 --> 14:26.295
He's been chewing
on the wrong kind of jungle growth.

14:26.505 --> 14:29.000
You know what he's talking about.
We both do.

14:29.221 --> 14:32.096
Not now, Weeks. l'm not in the mood.

14:32.312 --> 14:35.437
'he Ghost Who Walks''.
The Phantom.

14:35.654 --> 14:38.494
lt's nonsense.
According to legend, he's immortal.

14:38.704 --> 14:41.377
He's been around for four centuries.

14:41.628 --> 14:43.624
lmagine, 400 years. lt isn't possible.

14:55.581 --> 14:56.828
Ouch!

14:57.044 --> 14:58.920
- Did that sting?
- Yes.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.423
Good. That means it's working.

15:07.028 --> 15:10.450
This is it.
This is what l'm looking for.

15:10.663 --> 15:13.538
The Skulls of Touganda.

15:13.754 --> 15:16.594
One made of gold,
one made of silver, one made of jade.

15:16.804 --> 15:19.215
Are they valuable?

15:19.436 --> 15:21.931
More than that, Guran.
They're dangerous.

15:22.151 --> 15:25.240
Listen. 'hen placed together,
the three skulls harness an energy

15:25.451 --> 15:29.372
a thousand times greater than any
force or high explosive known to man.''

15:29.587 --> 15:31.797
lt's all right here in the chronicles.

15:32.010 --> 15:34.885
''A long time ago, the Touganda tribe
possessed the skulls.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.107
'hey knew the secret
of keeping their force contained.

15:38.318 --> 15:41.740
'heir village was attacked
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

15:41.953 --> 15:45.708
'he tribe was destroyed and
the skulls were separated and lost.

15:45.922 --> 15:48.631
''For four centuries,
there's been no trace of them...

15:48.846 --> 15:50.925
Until today.

15:55.279 --> 15:59.783
You know, l'm fine!
l'm as good as new.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.505
Very well, Ghost Who Walks.
Maybe later.

16:03.718 --> 16:05.548
Yeah, maybe...

16:13.369 --> 16:15.994
l used to come here myself, Kit.

16:16.209 --> 16:20.713
l would consult the chronicles
for guidance and wisdom.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.936
Usually when l was troubled
or confused,

16:24.147 --> 16:27.069
or had just screwed up real bad.

16:27.280 --> 16:33.043
l'm guilty on all counts, Dad.
l let that skull slip through my fingers.

16:33.254 --> 16:37.674
Don't be too hard on yourself.
We all make mistakes.

16:37.891 --> 16:41.348
- This one gets worse...
- How so?

16:41.567 --> 16:45.572
lt was the Sengh Brotherhood.
l saw the spiderweb tattoo.

16:45.787 --> 16:51.585
You turned over one of the Skulls
of Touganda to the Sengh Brotherhood?

16:51.803 --> 16:57.185
They've tried to get their hands
on those skulls for 400 years!

16:58.863 --> 17:01.536
They don't have all three.

17:01.745 --> 17:04.240
We don't know how many they have.

17:04.461 --> 17:09.261
Have you any idea what it means,
if they get control of the skulls?

17:09.473 --> 17:13.263
- They'd be invincible.
- Then stop them!

17:13.483 --> 17:16.608
You're the only one who can.

17:18.874 --> 17:21.451
Excuse me, Ghost Who Walks.

17:21.673 --> 17:26.009
- Yes, Guran?
- l thought l heard...

17:26.226 --> 17:32.405
- Were you talking to somebody?.
- Just to myself. l was talking to myself.

17:49.871 --> 17:53.043
l beg your pardon,
you can't park there!

17:53.255 --> 17:56.926
Oh, Miss Palmer.
l didn't realise. l'm very sorry.

17:57.141 --> 18:00.396
Forget it. l'd throw me out, too,
if l didn't know better.

18:00.608 --> 18:03.103
Welcome back, Miss Palmer.

18:03.323 --> 18:06.994
- Let me help you with those things.
- Thank you.

18:27.888 --> 18:29.265
Oh, Diana!

18:29.475 --> 18:31.555
Mother!

18:34.781 --> 18:38.916
- You look absolutely stunning.
- Your timing couldn't be worse.

18:39.126 --> 18:42.131
- But how are you, sweetheart?
- Lily, you look marvellous.

18:42.342 --> 18:45.134
- l've contracted malaria, Mother.
- That's nice!

18:45.350 --> 18:48.059
- Diana!
- Uncle Dave!

18:48.275 --> 18:50.948
- Sorry, l didn't realise it was a party.
- lt's nothing.

18:51.157 --> 18:54.614
Just a Palmer Foundation dinner.
l'm much happier to see you.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.375
- How was the Yukon?
- Dave, it's cold.

18:57.591 --> 19:02.059
What more do you want to know?.
Well, why don't you freshen up?

19:02.270 --> 19:07.319
- l'll get something to eat.
- Jimmy Wells would love to see you.

19:11.502 --> 19:12.999
Hello, Xander.

19:13.215 --> 19:16.554
Lily, why is Xander Drax here?

19:16.766 --> 19:19.938
He made a very large contribution
to the Foundation.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.275
- Return it.
- But he's a respected businessman.

19:23.492 --> 19:25.987
No, Lily, he's a thug.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.002
Hi, Mr Drax.

19:28.213 --> 19:31.135
l had the strangest urge
a few weeks ago!

19:31.346 --> 19:35.219
l wanted to charter a plane,
track you down in the frozen north,

19:35.440 --> 19:38.529
charge into your tent, hut or log cabin,

19:38.740 --> 19:42.031
sweep you off your feet,
and bring you back to New York.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.827
Really, Jimmy?. Why didn't you?

19:45.048 --> 19:47.888
After a few sets of tennis
and a cold Gin Fizz,

19:48.098 --> 19:50.854
the urge just seemed to pass.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.854
You're pretty
in those woodsy flannels.

19:59.795 --> 20:03.752
You have to admit, Diana...
There's magic there.

20:05.519 --> 20:08.893
What's in the sandwich?

20:09.111 --> 20:10.489
Baloney.

20:10.699 --> 20:13.491
Mayor, Commissioner.
Enjoying yourselves?

20:13.707 --> 20:17.580
- As much as l can in this monkey suit.
- Wonderful. You've outdone yourself.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.595
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Excuse me.

20:19.806 --> 20:23.762
- Here's the man l want to see.
- You're not welcome here, Mr Drax.

20:23.984 --> 20:26.990
The Police Commissioner is right here.
Have me arrested!

20:27.200 --> 20:29.410
Sample the canapés on your way out.

20:29.623 --> 20:35.137
- For God's sake, that's not necessary.
- That's all right, l can speak for myself.

20:35.347 --> 20:39.601
Tell me, your reporters are poking
their noses into my personal affairs...

20:39.817 --> 20:42.228
l don't understand why. Do you?

20:42.449 --> 20:46.120
Yes. And you will,
when we publish our story.

20:46.334 --> 20:49.043
Why go after me?
l'm just a private citizen.

20:49.258 --> 20:52.300
You own companies
that regulate public utilities.

20:52.517 --> 20:57.186
You control the trade unions,
influence interest rates and stock prices.

20:57.405 --> 21:01.491
And you have involvements
with the Zephro crime family.

21:01.708 --> 21:05.546
l'd say you're
a very public figure, Mr Drax.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.764
l've never heard such tall tales!

21:09.979 --> 21:13.235
Have you been talking to my ex-wives?

21:13.447 --> 21:17.533
- How much does this newspaper cost?
- Two cents daily, five cents on Sunday.

21:17.750 --> 21:21.884
No, all of it. The building,
the presses, the typewriters...

21:22.094 --> 21:25.884
- Maybe l'll buy the whole damn thing.
- Not everything in life is for sale.

21:26.105 --> 21:28.184
Of course it is, Dave!

21:29.531 --> 21:33.202
And l'll tell you something else.
l usually get what l want.

21:41.186 --> 21:45.107
Gentlemen, l have no axe to grind.
l'm only interested in the truth.

21:45.322 --> 21:48.613
l've learnt something
from a source at the city library.

21:48.831 --> 21:51.706
Drax has been extensively
researching esoteric volumes.

21:51.923 --> 21:55.796
They are normally kept
under constant lock and key.

21:56.017 --> 21:59.022
He's interested in something
connected with this symbol.

22:03.954 --> 22:07.209
- What does it mean?
- He's on a quest.

22:07.421 --> 22:10.712
For a supernatural power.

22:10.931 --> 22:15.980
These are dangerous times. Dictators
are popping up all over the world.

22:16.194 --> 22:19.569
Drax already has the desire
to become one himself.

22:19.787 --> 22:23.244
- This will provide him with the means.
- That's nonsense.

22:23.464 --> 22:26.802
l know it's hard to fathom,
but Drax believes in it.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.973
This man must be taken seriously.

22:30.189 --> 22:34.823
l've traced the origin of that symbol
to a place called the Bengalla Jungle.

22:35.036 --> 22:37.875
This is a ticket for the Clipper.
You're not going there?

22:38.085 --> 22:43.218
My plans were to leave tomorrow
and meet up with a Captain Horton.

22:43.433 --> 22:48.482
But now... l don't know if l can turn
my back on Drax for that long.

22:48.696 --> 22:52.701
- lt's just a wild goose chase, anyway.
- That's right.

22:52.916 --> 22:55.838
A far-off jungle's no place for you.

22:56.049 --> 22:59.174
l agree. You need to stay here
and take care of things.

22:59.391 --> 23:02.646
There you go, Dave.
Listen to your niece.

23:04.446 --> 23:09.080
- Let me go for you.
- l don't know, Diana...

23:09.292 --> 23:11.003
l want to go.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.782
You were right, Mr Drax.
They know far too much.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.730
All right, l'll be there...

24:08.029 --> 24:10.239
- Hey!
- Call him back.

24:11.455 --> 24:13.166
Thank you, sir.

24:14.379 --> 24:18.799
lt's Ray Zephro. Our little tootsie
is boarding the plane right now.

24:19.016 --> 24:21.392
Say the word and
l'll drag her off by her hair.

24:21.606 --> 24:25.112
Thanks, Ray, but l have
another way of dealing with this.

24:26.620 --> 24:31.088
After all, l do have friends
in that part of the world.

24:32.844 --> 24:35.137
l've got to go. Dr Fleming is here.

24:35.351 --> 24:38.107
The librarian.

24:39.821 --> 24:43.492
Dr Fleming!
Thanks so much for coming.

24:43.706 --> 24:45.952
l don't mind. lt's a nice day for a walk.

24:46.171 --> 24:49.260
Yes, it certainly is. Please, sit down.

24:49.471 --> 24:51.514
So, how can l help you?

24:51.727 --> 24:57.490
You can reassure me that my research
at the library is strictly confidential.

24:57.701 --> 25:02.870
- Of course it is!
- Really?. Are you sure?

25:03.090 --> 25:06.547
Dave Palmer has been
poking his nose into my business.

25:06.767 --> 25:11.436
You have nothing to worry about,
Mr Drax. Your privacy is protected.

25:11.654 --> 25:15.611
All requests for access
to special collections come to me.

25:15.832 --> 25:18.873
l'm the only one who sees them.

25:19.968 --> 25:22.843
Well, good.
l feel a whole lot better now.

25:23.978 --> 25:28.065
Thanks for coming.
Oh, one more thing, if you don't mind.

25:28.281 --> 25:31.406
l'd like your professional opinion
on something under this microscope.

25:31.623 --> 25:33.584
Sure.

25:33.796 --> 25:36.338
Here, let me hold your glasses.

25:45.618 --> 25:49.207
- l don't see a thing.
- Just turn the focus knob.

25:58.945 --> 26:01.785
l guess you won't be
needing these any more.

26:08.804 --> 26:11.596
- Your coffee, Miss.
- Thanks.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.532
Guran, l'm leaving.

26:35.374 --> 26:38.665
l'm going with Zak. What are you
listening to? ''Junior G-Man''?

26:38.883 --> 26:41.425
l wish it was. This is real.

26:48.909 --> 26:51.285
The Pan Am Clipper has been
forced down over the ocean.

27:18.111 --> 27:20.487
He'll do.

27:20.701 --> 27:23.457
We want Diana Palmer.

27:23.667 --> 27:30.641
We're prepared to kill all of you,
one by one, until she steps forward.

27:30.852 --> 27:34.477
- No, please!
- l'm Diana Palmer.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.987
So quickly. How disappointing...

27:45.599 --> 27:49.224
Happy now?. Get a good look?.

27:52.075 --> 27:55.116
- l'll stay on the radio, Captain.
- All right.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.089
Wake me,
if there's any news.

28:11.626 --> 28:14.632
Can't you ever come in
through the front door?.

28:14.843 --> 28:18.549
lt's too obvious. l like the window.

28:20.399 --> 28:24.237
- lt's good to see you, Phantom.
- Captain.

28:24.451 --> 28:29.002
- We've had some trouble tonight.
- So l've heard. Any news?

28:29.214 --> 28:32.173
The passengers were picked up
by a Portuguese fishing boat.

28:32.389 --> 28:37.688
Everyone is safe, except one
young woman who was abducted.

28:37.903 --> 28:39.448
Who?

28:39.658 --> 28:42.283
She was on her way to see me,
oddly enough.

28:42.499 --> 28:46.337
- Her name is Diana Palmer.
- Diana Palmer?.

28:46.551 --> 28:48.761
From New York?.
Uncle owns the Tribune?

28:48.974 --> 28:53.061
- That's right. How did you know?.
- l heard the name somewhere.

28:54.948 --> 28:57.490
First those graverobbers
and now this.

28:57.705 --> 29:01.329
- l only hope we can get her back.
- l'll see what l can do.

29:01.548 --> 29:04.471
You'd better go out
the way you came in.

29:04.682 --> 29:07.473
l have enough trouble
pretending you're not real.

29:11.324 --> 29:13.236
Thanks, Zak.

29:19.387 --> 29:22.726
Ghost Who Walks,
l remember they had aeroplane.

29:22.938 --> 29:26.894
- Who, the bad men?
- A plane with boats for feet.

29:27.115 --> 29:31.750
Boats for feet?
What, seaplanes? Seaplanes!

29:44.870 --> 29:47.912
- Thanks for the help.
- Let's see her face.

29:52.933 --> 29:57.234
She's sort of pretty
in a spoiled rich girl kind of way.

29:57.445 --> 30:02.495
Who are you? Are you crazy?. Do you
realise how many laws you've broken?

30:02.709 --> 30:06.629
Disruption of international
air transportation, abduction...

30:06.845 --> 30:08.757
Piracy, kidnapping...

30:08.975 --> 30:10.852
Oh! Feisty, too.

30:11.064 --> 30:12.775
Shut up.

30:12.986 --> 30:17.037
lf this kidnapping is about money,
you won't get one cent.

30:17.247 --> 30:19.373
Not one red cent!

30:24.558 --> 30:30.570
l've got to report in now.
Somebody has a big interest in you.

30:30.782 --> 30:34.038
Maybe when l get back,
you and l can spend some time alone.

30:53.759 --> 30:57.715
Good work, Zak.
Now go back to the Rope People.

30:57.937 --> 31:02.072
Stay away from bad guys.

31:47.107 --> 31:51.444
Nice boots. Expensive, huh?

31:51.661 --> 31:53.288
Not really.

31:53.499 --> 31:59.214
Come on, we can talk.
lt's just us girls.

32:00.810 --> 32:02.770
Mind if l take a look?.

32:02.982 --> 32:05.275
Quit that!

32:09.667 --> 32:14.086
l was right.
Fifth Avenue, New York City!

32:16.016 --> 32:17.644
Just my size, too.

32:29.385 --> 32:31.962
What have we here?

32:35.735 --> 32:37.612
All right, gentlemen, nobody...

32:39.369 --> 32:42.043
Ladies, kindly pardon my error.

32:43.171 --> 32:44.668
Don't move!

32:47.850 --> 32:50.428
Oh, a love letter!

32:53.699 --> 32:57.156
- What is this, a ship full of women?
- All my pilots are women.

32:58.419 --> 33:00.665
lnteresting. Excuse me.

33:02.931 --> 33:05.605
- Who are you?
- A good Samaritan.

33:06.691 --> 33:10.030
l bet you're better than good.

33:12.247 --> 33:16.417
- l'll get the chance to find out...
- There's an old jungle saying:

33:16.634 --> 33:21.102
''Never point a gun at someone,
because it might go off.''

33:21.313 --> 33:25.067
Fast hands!
l like that in a man.

33:30.378 --> 33:32.421
Tie her up.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.931
Or don't...

33:36.143 --> 33:38.353
lt's personal.

33:40.279 --> 33:43.119
- Let's go.
- Not so fast. Why should l go with you?

33:43.329 --> 33:46.418
- Trust me, Diana.
- You know my name?

33:46.629 --> 33:49.385
Sure. You're Diana Palmer.

33:49.595 --> 33:53.599
Your kidnapping has been reported
to the authorities. This is a rescue!

33:55.193 --> 33:59.067
Thanks, you've done a good job.
l can take it from here.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.449
She's not changed a bit...

34:03.757 --> 34:06.882
- What the hell is going on?
- There's a man in a purple suit here.

34:07.099 --> 34:09.594
No, it can't be! Scramble the pilots!

34:09.815 --> 34:14.033
Find him, stop him!
Don't let him get off the ship! Now, go!

34:21.344 --> 34:24.469
- The engine room!
- l'll take the port side.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.563
- l think we should stick together.
- OK.

34:28.781 --> 34:31.870
We should stick together,
but l should go first.

34:32.081 --> 34:34.576
Fine, go ahead. lt's your rescue.

34:37.638 --> 34:39.634
Get a hold of him!

34:39.851 --> 34:42.608
Get back!

34:43.695 --> 34:47.914
Relax, pal! Relax!

34:48.123 --> 34:52.175
Small world, huh?
How is that knife wound doing?

34:53.721 --> 34:57.226
Where was it again?
Right about there?

35:02.954 --> 35:04.617
Good boy, Devil.

35:18.286 --> 35:22.040
- Your dog's a wolf.
- l know. Come on.

35:28.521 --> 35:29.768
Easy.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.620
- Come on, get in.
- You can fly a plane?

35:40.636 --> 35:43.761
Of course you can. Why ask?.

35:50.245 --> 35:54.463
Let's go! They're getting away!
We've got to stop them!

36:07.665 --> 36:10.125
Mount up, we're going after them!

36:23.833 --> 36:28.086
Hurry up, let's go!
Come on, come on!

36:37.911 --> 36:39.907
Stay with us! Ride fast!

37:38.528 --> 37:40.988
We're losing fuel!
We better take her down!

37:52.691 --> 37:55.862
- See the pontoon?
- Yes.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.785
- Climb onto it.
- What?

37:57.996 --> 37:59.908
Trust me.

38:00.127 --> 38:02.669
l must be crazy.

38:45.872 --> 38:48.747
- Who's flying the plane?
- l jammed the stick.

38:48.963 --> 38:51.339
There's not much time.
The clearing's short.

38:51.553 --> 38:54.048
- Get ready.
- Get ready?.

38:59.783 --> 39:02.824
- You can't!
- We have to.

39:29.110 --> 39:31.687
OK, jump!

39:54.050 --> 39:58.351
- l can't believe we just did that.
- Neither can l.

40:08.045 --> 40:11.004
Swing around behind me.

40:25.549 --> 40:28.508
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hit anything?

40:35.158 --> 40:38.663
Come on, step on it! Faster!

40:51.618 --> 40:56.334
Catch them!
Don't let them escape! Go, go!

41:08.621 --> 41:10.581
We can't outrun them
doubled up like this.

41:10.793 --> 41:13.834
Don't worry,
l've got friends in these woods.

41:43.378 --> 41:47.430
- How did you do that?
- My friends, the Rope People.

41:54.324 --> 41:56.819
- Are you OK?.
- l just feel a little dizzy.

41:57.039 --> 41:58.750
lt must be the humidity.

43:01.333 --> 43:04.042
- Wait here one second?
- OK.

43:28.404 --> 43:32.490
l want to give you something
to remember me by.

43:32.707 --> 43:34.869
l don't think that's a problem.

43:35.088 --> 43:38.094
Well, you won't find these in New York.

43:39.349 --> 43:43.935
Black pearls. They're beautiful!

43:44.153 --> 43:50.332
They were a gift to an ancestor
by a grateful Arabian prince.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.753
- l want you to have them.
- Thank you.

43:53.971 --> 43:56.929
Oh, no! Not the old pearl ploy again.

43:57.146 --> 44:00.068
That's what passes for humour
in the jungle, Diana.

44:00.279 --> 44:03.201
Captain Horton, Diana Palmer.

44:03.412 --> 44:05.622
Thank God you're all right Diana.

44:05.835 --> 44:10.469
- How did you manage to get her away?.
- Diana did all the work, actually.

44:10.681 --> 44:13.556
Not only is he mysterious,
he's modest, too.

44:13.773 --> 44:17.479
Old jungle saying:
''Phantom is many men.''

44:17.700 --> 44:21.157
No smoking in the Skull Cave.

44:21.376 --> 44:24.465
Sorry, l forgot.

44:24.676 --> 44:29.476
l received your uncle's wire. What's
so important as to bring you here?

44:31.360 --> 44:33.986
Can you identify this symbol?

44:40.050 --> 44:42.806
You'd better have a look.

44:47.569 --> 44:50.659
Well, somebody say something.

44:50.870 --> 44:54.244
We're all mixed-up
with the Sengh Brotherhood.

44:54.463 --> 44:57.219
- The what?
- Sengh Brotherhood.

44:57.429 --> 45:00.185
An ancient order of evil.
They started out as pirates.

45:00.395 --> 45:03.235
Nowadays, there's no telling
what they've become.

45:03.444 --> 45:06.569
- Where did you get this?
- New York.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.995
My uncle's newspaper
is investigating Xander Drax.

45:10.212 --> 45:12.707
He's crazy, power-mad.

45:12.928 --> 45:17.597
Take her back. Use every man
at your disposal and give her protection.

45:17.815 --> 45:20.441
Wait!
You're going to send me away?.

45:20.656 --> 45:22.283
l'm afraid so.

45:22.494 --> 45:25.750
l came here to do a job,
and that's what l'm going to do.

45:25.962 --> 45:28.884
There's a lot more l need to know.

45:29.095 --> 45:30.556
Goodbye.

45:31.852 --> 45:34.858
- Wait a second!
- Diana...

45:35.946 --> 45:38.869
- Nobody argues with the Phantom and wins.
- Old jungle saying.

45:56.458 --> 45:58.918
Oh, baby...

46:00.093 --> 46:03.633
Oh, it is beautiful!

46:03.853 --> 46:07.726
l used a little toothpaste on it.
lt polished up so good.

46:09.075 --> 46:11.784
Toothpaste? Really?.

46:11.999 --> 46:13.911
That's nice.

46:15.132 --> 46:20.098
You know,
l am in such a good mood right now.

46:20.313 --> 46:23.603
l almost hate to mention this.

46:23.822 --> 46:26.281
The happy home-coming!

46:26.495 --> 46:30.500
Kind of brings a tear to the eye,
doesn't it? What went wrong?

46:32.678 --> 46:37.063
- Something you didn't count on.
- Oh? Really?.

46:37.274 --> 46:41.742
- And what was that?
- The Phantom.

46:41.953 --> 46:46.421
- l thought that was a superstition.
- Oh, no. He's real.

46:46.632 --> 46:50.885
And he won't die. l know,
l killed him once and he isn't dead.

46:51.102 --> 46:56.317
- That doesn't make sense.
- Look, l brought this to prove it.

47:00.752 --> 47:05.053
See this hole? That's where
l stuck him with a 12-inch blade.

47:05.264 --> 47:08.603
You stabbed him in the back?.
l've underestimated you, Quill.

47:08.815 --> 47:12.154
- Right up to the hilt.
- That should've done the trick.

47:12.366 --> 47:16.869
The Phantom helped Diana to escape.
l think he's in love with her.

47:17.086 --> 47:20.342
This is getting more interesting.
Why do you say that?

47:20.554 --> 47:25.022
Because he could have had me...
but he picked her.

47:25.233 --> 47:30.996
- That could only be love.
- Or simply bad judgement.

47:31.207 --> 47:36.340
- So, what should we do about him?
- Do? Nothing.

47:36.554 --> 47:42.187
This is New York. l'm not concerned
with some jungle hero half a world away.

47:55.312 --> 47:57.521
Here. Keep the change.

47:57.735 --> 47:59.017
Hey!

48:02.873 --> 48:06.747
Not so fast, buddy-boy.
This isn't real money.

48:06.967 --> 48:09.296
You're right, that's Bengalla currency.

48:09.515 --> 48:12.307
Coin of the realm
would be appreciated.

48:12.523 --> 48:16.028
- l'm afraid that's all l've got.
- lt'd better not be.

48:17.453 --> 48:20.162
All right, here...

48:20.377 --> 48:22.420
Where is it?

48:26.518 --> 48:28.680
These are opals.

48:30.028 --> 48:32.701
And that's...

48:32.910 --> 48:36.451
..a star sapphire.

48:36.670 --> 48:40.341
Take all of them.
Don't worry, they're real.

48:40.555 --> 48:43.347
They'll secure your services
for the rest of the day, so wait here.

48:43.563 --> 48:44.976
- You're kidding?
- l never kid.

48:57.140 --> 49:01.525
God is dead,
and darkness rules the earth.

49:03.156 --> 49:05.366
America is in financial ruin.

49:05.579 --> 49:08.704
Europe and Asia
are on the brink of self-annihilation.

49:08.921 --> 49:10.881
Chaos reigns.

49:11.093 --> 49:16.689
But like l've always said,
there is opportunity in chaos.

49:16.900 --> 49:21.201
And so, my brothers,
l give you...

49:21.412 --> 49:23.824
..the Skull of Touganda.

49:26.467 --> 49:30.602
This skull is one of three.
When all three skulls are united,

49:30.812 --> 49:36.277
they will produce a force
more powerful than any army on earth.

49:36.493 --> 49:39.915
You've only got the one!

49:40.963 --> 49:43.541
Legend has it
that if the skulls are separated,

49:43.762 --> 49:46.519
two of the skulls
will point the way to the third.

49:46.729 --> 49:49.604
- Like l said, you've only got...
- Raymond, Raymond...

49:49.820 --> 49:54.656
Ray, l know the location
of the second skull, OK?.

49:59.637 --> 50:04.771
The symbol of the Sengh Brotherhood.
We shall succeed where they've failed.

50:04.985 --> 50:09.904
The skulls will be ours, and
all of the power that comes with them.

50:22.698 --> 50:25.739
Count me out. This is wrong.

50:25.956 --> 50:30.840
Skulls? Forces of darkness?
This isn't right.

50:31.053 --> 50:34.012
l was an altar boy at Saint Timothy's.

50:34.228 --> 50:38.862
So were you, Charlie. This isn't right,
we weren't raised this way.

50:39.074 --> 50:41.117
Sit down, Ray.

50:41.330 --> 50:44.502
The only power l believe in
comes out of the barrel of a gun.

50:44.714 --> 50:47.969
Not from some jungle souvenirs!

50:48.181 --> 50:50.142
Come on, Charlie.

50:50.354 --> 50:53.775
You're on your own, Ray.

50:56.453 --> 50:58.745
- What?
- You're on your own.

51:03.388 --> 51:06.560
Fine. Suit yourself.

51:08.986 --> 51:13.454
But l'm gone, Drax.
l'm taking my entire syndicate with me.

51:13.665 --> 51:15.875
OK, if that's how you feel about it.

51:21.853 --> 51:24.978
My bursitis is really flaring up again.

51:26.198 --> 51:29.073
Charlie, you're the new boss of bosses.

51:29.289 --> 51:32.794
- Think you can handle it?
- l've been waiting all my life.

51:33.007 --> 51:34.420
Good man.

51:34.636 --> 51:37.559
Plans have been set for tonight.

51:37.770 --> 51:40.312
We'll go in and get the item
while the building is closed.

51:40.527 --> 51:44.911
No, l can't wait that long.
This is too exciting! We go in now.

51:45.122 --> 51:48.378
- Now, in the middle of the afternoon?
- Yes!

51:48.590 --> 51:53.937
l would appreciate it if you'd
keep the police away until l'm done.

52:04.297 --> 52:05.925
Hey, there! Found you.

52:06.136 --> 52:08.761
Page One Girl
back from the escapade in the jungle.

52:08.976 --> 52:11.650
- Why are you here?
- l was in town on business...

52:11.859 --> 52:13.771
- Business?
- l was having some suits made.

52:13.989 --> 52:16.746
- That's not business!
- lt is for the guy making the suit.

52:16.956 --> 52:20.330
Why do you have to be difficult?
Let's have dinner and catch a show.

52:20.548 --> 52:25.634
- Can l take a rain check?.
- Sure. Add it to your collection.

52:25.854 --> 52:30.904
Diana, l have a surprise for you.
Come into my office.

52:36.047 --> 52:39.504
- Kit!
- Hello, Diana.

52:39.724 --> 52:42.219
lt's been a while, hasn't it?

52:42.439 --> 52:45.814
- A few years, at least.
- Six to be exact.

52:46.032 --> 52:47.909
l read about what happened.
Are you OK?.

52:48.121 --> 52:52.589
l'm fine. lt started out bad,
but it all turned out OK.

52:52.800 --> 52:56.055
- By the by, Jimmy Wells.
- Hi. Kit Walker.

52:56.267 --> 53:00.271
So tell me, Kit,
where do you know our Diana from?

53:00.486 --> 53:02.946
We were friends at college.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.572
l see.

53:05.792 --> 53:10.212
- Are you living here in New York?.
- No, l'm just passing through.

53:10.429 --> 53:13.103
l'm catching up on old times
with Uncle Dave here.

53:13.312 --> 53:18.861
- Yes. Trading information about Drax.
- What do you know about Drax?.

53:19.077 --> 53:24.460
He's come across a rare artefact
connected to the Sengh Brotherhood.

53:24.675 --> 53:28.845
lt's an old silver skull
with precious stones for the eyes.

53:29.061 --> 53:33.446
- l've seen something like that before.
- You have?

53:33.657 --> 53:36.615
Yes, but it wasn't silver,
l think it was green.

53:36.832 --> 53:39.790
Green... Jade, perhaps.

53:42.430 --> 53:45.721
l mean, where did you see it?

53:45.939 --> 53:49.859
Let me see.
lt was my twelfth birthday party.

53:50.075 --> 53:53.080
Mum and Dad had rented a big room.

53:53.291 --> 53:56.915
Now l remember.
The Museum of World History.

53:59.641 --> 54:02.398
- Yes, sir. At your service.
- You're in a good mood.

54:02.607 --> 54:06.398
You bet. While you were inside,
l had those stones appraised.

54:06.618 --> 54:09.624
- You can call me Al.
- Kit Walker.

54:09.835 --> 54:11.545
- l'm going with you.
- Diana...

54:11.756 --> 54:15.345
- Where to now, sir?.
- The Museum of World History.

54:15.558 --> 54:18.100
You heard the lady.

54:26.838 --> 54:30.093
You look great, Diana.
You've not changed a blt.

54:30.305 --> 54:32.931
You just vanished, Kit.

54:33.146 --> 54:35.438
l guess l did.

54:35.652 --> 54:38.742
Not a word, not a letter.
Not even a phone call.

54:38.953 --> 54:41.662
- l know.
- Why?.

54:41.877 --> 54:44.419
l had to go home.

54:45.888 --> 54:51.235
- My father died rather suddenly.
- l'm sorry.

54:51.444 --> 54:54.153
l never heard from you again.

54:54.368 --> 54:58.419
l had to take over the family business.

54:58.629 --> 55:03.346
lt's hard to explain, but l've thought
a lot about you since then, Diana.

55:04.394 --> 55:09.111
l've thought about you too, Kit.
Then l stopped and went on with my life.

55:25.700 --> 55:30.453
lt's all wrong. lt's the wrong century,
the wrong hemisphere.

55:30.672 --> 55:35.140
lt's the wrong culture. The skull hasn't
been lost, just misplaced.

55:35.351 --> 55:38.273
What's your interest
with Drax and these skulls?

55:38.484 --> 55:41.323
l represent their true owners.
l want to see them returned.

55:41.533 --> 55:46.453
Drax wants them for himself. l can't let
Drax get his hands on this skull.

55:46.672 --> 55:49.512
l've got to get it out of here.

55:49.722 --> 55:52.763
Uncle Dave knows an important
member on the board of directors.

55:52.980 --> 55:55.820
lt may take a day or two, but...

55:57.367 --> 56:00.206
Or we could just break the glass.

56:06.766 --> 56:09.606
l'll take that, thank you.

56:17.628 --> 56:20.836
Museum security.
Everything's under control.

56:21.054 --> 56:25.889
Free cake and sandwiches
are served in the Hall of Nature.

56:26.109 --> 56:29.233
Bring the little ones.
Don't miss out. Thank you.

56:29.451 --> 56:30.912
Bye-bye.

56:33.294 --> 56:37.678
- Who are you?
- A collector like yourself, Mr Drax.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.515
Drax, what's with the bag?

56:54.851 --> 56:57.642
Something's happening!

57:04.459 --> 57:09.378
This is it!
lt's happening right here and now!

57:12.940 --> 57:14.484
Unbelievable!

57:14.694 --> 57:19.079
lt's beautiful! lt's magnificent!

57:19.290 --> 57:23.341
Show me the power!
Show me the power!

57:27.979 --> 57:30.189
Yes!

57:30.402 --> 57:31.602
Amazing!

57:32.742 --> 57:33.942
Amazing!

57:41.097 --> 57:43.389
l love this!

58:06.956 --> 58:08.239
Wow!

58:20.533 --> 58:22.446
The skulls have spoken.

59:17.015 --> 59:22.647
All right, what's your name?
Why do you want that skull so badly?.

59:22.863 --> 59:24.943
Kit Walker.

59:25.161 --> 59:27.038
- And who is Kit Walker?.
- l am.

59:27.250 --> 59:30.957
- And the skull?
- lt'd go well with my drapes.

59:31.177 --> 59:33.636
Cute. You're very cute, Mr Walker.

59:33.851 --> 59:36.143
Fortunately, l have a cure for that.

59:39.156 --> 59:41.948
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

59:43.459 --> 59:45.419
Diana, are you sweet on Mr Walker?.

59:45.631 --> 59:48.637
l thought that your true love
was swinging around in the jungle.

59:48.848 --> 59:53.067
How did you...?
l mean, who told you that?

59:53.277 --> 59:54.559
l did!

59:54.780 --> 59:57.739
Sala's got all the latest gossip
on two continents.

59:57.955 --> 01:00:02.209
Deny it. He's in love with you,
and you're nuts about him.

01:00:02.425 --> 01:00:06.264
From the moment he came flying down
that laundry chute, you were hooked.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.604
''Kismet in the jungle.''

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:12.322
You're despicable.
You're just jealous.

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:17.672
- Now l'm one up on you.
- Ladies...

01:00:17.883 --> 01:00:23.895
Quill, show Mr Walker up to
the observation deck and make him talk.

01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:27.904
l claim the body, when you're done.

01:00:28.118 --> 01:00:29.995
Now...

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.711
Once l check these coordinates
we'll know the location of the third skull.

01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:13.945
Get up. Follow me.

01:02:32.026 --> 01:02:35.234
- Well, l'll be damned.
- What?

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:40.252
The Devil's Vortex.
We are going to the Devil's Vortex.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.960
Are you sure? Check again,
maybe you've made a mistake.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.677
No, no mistake.

01:02:44.893 --> 01:02:48.648
lsn't that the place
where ships disappear?.

01:02:48.862 --> 01:02:50.988
Yes! lncredible, isn't it?

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:54.623
There must be an island there.
An uncharted island.

01:02:54.836 --> 01:02:58.091
Maybe my brother was right
about all that stuff.

01:02:58.303 --> 01:03:03.899
Nonsense! Come on, Charlie.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.153
Where's your spirit of adventure?

01:03:19.024 --> 01:03:23.111
Mr Drax, l've made all the arrangements.
You're getting a full police escort.

01:03:23.327 --> 01:03:27.747
Excellent. Have you heard the news?
We're going to the Devil's Vortex.

01:03:27.964 --> 01:03:30.839
The Phantom's in the building.
l saw him with my own eyes.

01:03:31.056 --> 01:03:35.142
Tell your officers there's a madman here.
He's armed and dangerous.

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.364
- Shoot on sight.
- Don't worry, l'll take care of it.

01:03:38.575 --> 01:03:40.322
- And the girl?
- Bring her.

01:03:40.539 --> 01:03:43.379
She's our Phantom insurance.

01:03:44.925 --> 01:03:46.338
Get me Security.

01:04:52.394 --> 01:04:55.103
We're all ready here, sir.

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:01.156
Pardon me.

01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:15.870
Look out!

01:05:19.465 --> 01:05:24.015
- Follow that car.
- Take my money, but don't hurt me.

01:05:24.227 --> 01:05:26.853
l'm a friend of Kit Walker's.
l need your help.

01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:32.288
Hey! Hey, you! Come back here!

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.268
Hey!

01:06:46.317 --> 01:06:48.563
- What's back there?
- The zoo.

01:07:01.566 --> 01:07:03.608
This is where
he would have entered.

01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:24.576
He sure as hell isn't around here.
Let's keep looking.

01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:37.064
Good girl.

01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:48.763
Stop! Hold it right there!

01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:03.011
Get in!

01:08:18.267 --> 01:08:21.522
Forget him, he's not coming.

01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:24.490
He's probably dead by now.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.696
What is wrong with you?

01:08:26.913 --> 01:08:29.374
Why are you so mean?
Don't you care about anything?

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:32.296
- Like what?
- You figure it out.

01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:37.098
All right, everybody just shut up!
Step on it, Quill.

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:46.082
Drax is heading for the docks.
l picked it up on my police band.

01:08:46.298 --> 01:08:49.923
- l thought you'd want to know.
- Thanks. Step on it, huh?

01:08:50.142 --> 01:08:53.682
lt's the bottom of the ninth
and you're two skulls behind.

01:08:55.406 --> 01:08:59.660
Dad, a man named Quill
has a gun belt like mine. ls it yours?

01:08:59.876 --> 01:09:02.252
Yes.

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:06.090
He said he could show me
the Sengh Brotherhood stronghold.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:09.350
He took me to a place
deep in the jungle.

01:09:09.568 --> 01:09:14.154
- What happened?
- He stabbed me in the back. Literally.

01:09:14.372 --> 01:09:17.711
So sue me.
l'm a lousy judge of character.

01:09:17.923 --> 01:09:20.549
- Maybe l can get the gun belt back.
- lf you haven't lost him.

01:09:20.764 --> 01:09:23.389
Don't worry, l'll catch him. l have to.

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:28.856
- There's a woman involved.
- Saints be praised! lt's about time.

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:32.167
- Tell him to step on it.
- Can you go any faster?.

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:35.216
- Are you talking to me now?.
- Yes. Can you pick it up?

01:09:35.426 --> 01:09:38.636
Sure. Hold on to your hat.
Or whatever.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:05.373
Looks like l've got a plane to catch.

01:10:07.511 --> 01:10:08.889
Thanks.

01:10:09.099 --> 01:10:12.805
Hey, pal! Give my best to Mr Walker.

01:10:19.877 --> 01:10:21.540
l love New York.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.665
We're getting close. We're almost there.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.800
- What's that?
- Where?

01:11:13.016 --> 01:11:14.429
1 1 o'clock.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.696
That's it.
There is an island!

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.701
Take her down.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:27.109
We're so close now. l can feel it.

01:13:27.327 --> 01:13:30.701
History is about to be made,
and you're all a part of it.

01:13:30.919 --> 01:13:34.376
An unequal part, of course,
but an important part, nonetheless.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:28.528
- This one is mine.
- ln your dreams.

01:14:33.124 --> 01:14:38.923
- Take it easy! My brothers, stay calm.
- Why do you call us brothers?

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.062
We, too, are members of the Sengh
Brotherhood.

01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:46.187
Nice going.

01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.910
Come with us.

01:14:56.017 --> 01:14:59.308
l think us girls should stick together.

01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:05.272
Now let me see...

01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:09.792
When was the last time
we had visitors here below the ocean,

01:16:10.003 --> 01:16:14.922
deep in the bowels
of this uncharted volcanic island?

01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:18.017
Never! Congratulations!

01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:22.074
You pathetic doomed fools are the first.

01:16:22.285 --> 01:16:27.251
- Who are these people?
- My name is Xander Drax.

01:16:29.095 --> 01:16:34.014
- What?
- X-A-N-D-E-R D-R-A-X.

01:16:34.233 --> 01:16:37.239
Xander Drax.
Begins and ends with the letter ''x''.

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.576
From New York City.

01:16:39.789 --> 01:16:44.209
And you, sir?. As long as we're making
polite introductions and chit-chat.

01:16:44.427 --> 01:16:49.642
- Who might you be?
- He is the Great Kabai Sengh.

01:16:49.857 --> 01:16:52.317
Leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

01:16:52.531 --> 01:16:57.616
Direct descendant of
the Evil Kabai Sengh...

01:16:57.837 --> 01:17:00.842
..first leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:07.319
You're a long way from New York City.
What brings you to this place?

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:17.428
These brought me here.

01:17:17.639 --> 01:17:19.884
The Skulls of Touganda.

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:23.359
And what do you know
of such matters?

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:27.491
l know all about these skulls
and the power they contain.

01:17:27.707 --> 01:17:31.081
Once all three are united...

01:17:31.299 --> 01:17:34.009
The two l hold...

01:17:35.477 --> 01:17:38.518
..and the one you have there.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.655
Look, O Great One.

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:46.127
l really wasn't in the market
for a partner,

01:17:46.339 --> 01:17:49.511
but we have
a mutually beneficial situation here.

01:17:49.723 --> 01:17:51.219
Think of it this way.

01:17:51.435 --> 01:17:55.392
You represent the old guard of grizzled
scallywags and Peg-leg Petes.

01:17:55.613 --> 01:17:58.535
l stand for the new order of things,
modern and up-to-date.

01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:01.455
Just the man to carry our cause
into the 20th century.

01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:03.001
Silence!

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:09.261
You have no bargaining power
with me, Mr New York City.

01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:13.071
l could kill you and
feed your pink ass to the sharks.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:20.260
Besides...
you don't have the fourth skull.

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:23.642
What fourth skull?
What are you talking about?

01:18:23.854 --> 01:18:25.600
There is no fourth skull.

01:18:25.817 --> 01:18:29.607
The fourth skull controls
the power of the other three.

01:18:29.828 --> 01:18:37.135
Without it, you've wasted your time
and your meaningless New York lives.

01:18:39.395 --> 01:18:41.724
Wait a minute!

01:18:41.943 --> 01:18:44.568
Anything happens to us,
others will come looking.

01:18:44.784 --> 01:18:49.334
They know where we are.
You'll have an army down your throats.

01:18:49.546 --> 01:18:51.458
Do you want that to happen?

01:18:54.016 --> 01:18:57.854
No, that's bullshit!
Nobody knows where we are!

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:00.985
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

01:19:01.202 --> 01:19:04.707
Spirit of adventure, my ass.
lt's every man for himself.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:11.847
OK, Kabie. You get me out of here
or else you sleep with the fishes.

01:19:12.063 --> 01:19:14.606
What are you going to say about that?

01:19:18.957 --> 01:19:21.368
What's that supposed to mean?

01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:25.759
Just ancient pirate talk for
''Fire the cannon''.

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:47.813
Great Kabai Sengh,
l'm Quill, a loyal follower and soldier.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.668
Look, l once killed the Phantom.

01:19:53.881 --> 01:19:57.256
Join the club. Many of us
have killed him over the years.

01:19:57.474 --> 01:20:00.931
But he keeps coming back.

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:05.451
Hey! l can see that this Phantom thing
really strikes a nerve.

01:20:05.662 --> 01:20:10.462
ln that case, you're going to love this.
She is his girlfriend!

01:20:10.675 --> 01:20:12.837
Bring her here.

01:20:20.075 --> 01:20:22.784
Think of the opportunities this presents.

01:20:22.999 --> 01:20:26.338
Ransom, bait, revenge!

01:20:31.814 --> 01:20:34.654
The Phantom has good taste.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:38.072
Good! Personal pleasure,
l overlooked that one.

01:20:38.289 --> 01:20:40.582
So, what do you say?.

01:20:40.796 --> 01:20:43.422
The girl for the skull
and l'm out of your hair.

01:20:44.681 --> 01:20:48.056
- You pirates need to get out more.
- Kabai Sengh!

01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:51.230
Phantom!

01:20:59.428 --> 01:21:00.841
Let's get him!

01:21:50.228 --> 01:21:51.475
Run away!

01:22:03.805 --> 01:22:08.356
Ghost Who Walks,
l'll cut you off at your knee!

01:23:04.924 --> 01:23:08.132
You're not immortal.

01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:12.188
l know your secrets, Phantom.

01:23:22.679 --> 01:23:25.768
Take them to your grave, Kabai Sengh.

01:23:35.922 --> 01:23:38.547
Sala! Cut the rope!

01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:16.352
- Torpedoes.
- This explains all those missing ships.

01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:19.492
You and Sala can escape in here.
l'll shoot you to the surface.

01:24:19.703 --> 01:24:22.459
Those are like warheads.
lf we hit anything, we're fish food.

01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:25.759
We'll use the periscope
to make sure the path is clear.

01:24:25.969 --> 01:24:27.846
Come on.

01:24:28.058 --> 01:24:32.229
- How are you going to get out?
- l'll be right behind you.

01:25:38.326 --> 01:25:40.156
At last.

01:25:40.373 --> 01:25:43.295
l've already killed you.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:52.981
No, you killed my father!

01:26:32.551 --> 01:26:35.760
You've got something
that belongs to me.

01:26:35.977 --> 01:26:37.259
No.

01:26:49.512 --> 01:26:52.007
- Drax, over here!
- What is it?

01:27:01.168 --> 01:27:03.627
These skulls are more powerful
than l imagined!

01:27:03.842 --> 01:27:08.178
l've harnessed the energy of the sun!
Who needs a fourth skull?

01:27:08.395 --> 01:27:11.187
l do. And l know where it is.

01:27:15.205 --> 01:27:18.080
l've worn it all my life. For protection.

01:27:19.758 --> 01:27:22.550
l've never understood
what that meant until right now.

01:27:26.025 --> 01:27:28.947
What a cheap jungle trick!

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:06.709
Unbelievable!

01:28:59.645 --> 01:29:02.770
- End of the line.
- We made it!

01:29:26.298 --> 01:29:28.544
lt all began 400 years ago,

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:33.064
when a boy saw his father murdered
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:36.234
That same boy
swore an oath of vengeance.

01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:40.156
He would fight piracy,
greed and cruelty in all its forms.

01:29:40.377 --> 01:29:43.002
He became the first Phantom.

01:29:44.554 --> 01:29:50.685
l'm his descendant, Diana,
sworn to carry out his oath.

01:29:50.904 --> 01:29:55.907
The mantle of the Phantom
was passed on from father to son.

01:29:56.126 --> 01:30:00.594
Twenty Phantoms came before me,
but no one knew that.

01:30:00.805 --> 01:30:05.225
They thought he was the same Phantom
and that he was immortal.

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:08.020
That's why they called him
'he Ghost Who Walks''.

01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:10.915
l'm not immortal, Diana.

01:30:11.124 --> 01:30:15.508
l was born right here in this cave
and educated in America.

01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:21.399
When my father was killed,
l came back to take his place.

01:30:28.586 --> 01:30:33.340
And one day,
your own son will take your place.

01:30:33.558 --> 01:30:35.554
Yes.

01:30:37.819 --> 01:30:41.408
The plane for Miss Palmer is waiting,
Ghost Who Walks.

01:30:41.621 --> 01:30:42.903
Thank you, Guran.

01:30:45.422 --> 01:30:49.890
- Does Guran know the truth?
- Oh, sure. He just likes to call me that.

01:30:58.039 --> 01:31:01.579
Goodbye, Devil.
Take good care of your master.

01:31:05.182 --> 01:31:07.344
l'd better go.

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:19.218
Hey, Kit.

01:31:19.428 --> 01:31:23.218
- l like her.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:31:23.439 --> 01:31:26.314
Well, get going!

01:31:59.617 --> 01:32:03.621
Before l go...
take off your mask.

01:32:04.964 --> 01:32:06.876
Let me see your face.

01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:09.848
Kit.

01:32:17.706 --> 01:32:22.672
l'm not really permitted
to reveal all of my secrets, Diana.

01:32:22.886 --> 01:32:25.428
You're not?

01:32:28.818 --> 01:32:32.608
Actually l am,
but only to one person.

01:32:32.829 --> 01:32:35.704
- Who's that?
- The woman l intend to marry.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.637
- What if she refuses you?
- No one refuses the Phantom.

01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:57.057
Goodbye.

01:33:24.005 --> 01:33:29.090
Leave lt to my son to let the perfect
woman slip through his ingers.

01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:31.936
Fortunately,
Diana knew her own mind.

01:33:32.151 --> 01:33:36.737
She vowed to herself that she would
soon return to the Bengalla Jungle.

01:33:36.955 --> 01:33:40.959
Maybe then l can get some rest.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.843
