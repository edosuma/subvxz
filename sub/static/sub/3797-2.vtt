03:09.375 --> 03:12.291
Federal agents.
Don't move.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.250
Get the rats
out of those corners.

03:23.250 --> 03:23.916
- Flush 'em out.
- Yes, sir.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.750
Cash on the table.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.208
That's right.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.083
Give 'em
the third degree, boys.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.958
Fuck.

03:33.958 --> 03:36.291
( music playing )

03:43.041 --> 03:45.000
Torrio:
 You sure, Nuck?
 Nothing to eat?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.791
Thank you, John, no.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.166
Grazie.

03:55.166 --> 03:55.958
Anisette?

03:55.958 --> 04:00.250
- John.
- For our guest.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.000
Snuck it back
from Naples.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.958
Well, in that case.

04:15.333 --> 04:18.541
So, what brings you
to New York?

04:18.541 --> 04:20.375
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.500
I'm from here.
Figured might as well
retire here.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.250
You look good, John.
Relaxed.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.916
I still can't
swallow right.

04:28.916 --> 04:32.416
A few crumbs from
a biscotto'll send me
into a choking fit.

04:32.416 --> 04:34.208
Small price to pay.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.791
If only I knew
what I was paying for.

04:36.791 --> 04:38.541
I'd always assumed
O'Banion.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.916
A little closer to home.

04:40.916 --> 04:43.625
Capone moved on you?

04:43.625 --> 04:47.250
Let's just say
whoever it was,
I got the message.

04:47.250 --> 04:50.750
Most fellas
in this business,

04:50.750 --> 04:52.916
they get their retirement
papers straight from
the Grim fucking Reaper.

04:52.916 --> 04:57.958
Colosimo, Rothstein,

04:57.958 --> 04:59.708
Masseria.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.583
Got his wake
tomorrow.

05:01.583 --> 05:02.541
Joe the Boss.

05:02.541 --> 05:05.625
Richest man
in the cemetery.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.458
I'll show up,
pretend to say a prayer,

05:07.458 --> 05:09.833
then I'll come home
and listen to Rudy Vallee.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.541
Pleasant evening.

05:11.541 --> 05:12.708
I got everything
I need, Nucky.

05:12.708 --> 05:16.166
I eat, go to pictures,
feed the birds.

05:16.166 --> 05:19.500
I walked away from
that other shit and
I never looked back.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.708
Then I suppose you'd have
no opinion on who tried
to have me clipped.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.958
What?
When was this?

05:26.958 --> 05:29.166
Havana.
Two days ago.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.666
Jesus Christ.

05:30.666 --> 05:34.875
I ran into Meyer Lansky
at a cafe before it happened.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.083
He's down there
all the time.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.000
- What for?
- Who knows?

05:38.000 --> 05:38.833
Get away from his wife.

05:38.833 --> 05:43.416
Masseria, then me.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.666
Within 24 hours.

05:45.666 --> 05:49.166
Ask me, the little
kike's taking orders
from Maranzano.

05:49.166 --> 05:52.291
Sit down with him direct.
Look him right in the eye.

05:52.291 --> 05:56.291
- Maranzano?
- I'll broker if you want.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.083
Be your go-between.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.083
Year in, year out,

06:04.083 --> 06:06.750
different dogs,
same fucking bone.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.833
Well, how many times
you need to hear it?

06:08.833 --> 06:11.208
Take the hint
and retire already.

06:21.958 --> 06:24.083
( sighs )

06:29.083 --> 06:31.500
Elenore:
O Lord, who watches
over children

06:31.500 --> 06:34.416
in this present life
and the world to come,

06:34.416 --> 06:37.916
bringing them to live
with the spirits

06:37.916 --> 06:40.041
of the divine rest,

06:40.041 --> 06:43.041
receive in peace
the soul

06:43.041 --> 06:47.125
of your little
servant Susan.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.416
- Amen.
- Ethan: Amen.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.000
( crying )

06:57.041 --> 06:58.708
( fly buzzing )

06:58.708 --> 07:01.125
Damn heat.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.875
Why haven't they come?

07:03.875 --> 07:06.708
I sent a message for
the undertaker hours ago.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.500
Say a prayer
for your sister.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.250
Go-- go on.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.750
Is she dead?

07:16.750 --> 07:19.625
- ( crying )
- Hush yourself now.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.291
She's with Jesus
now, dear.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.375
It's going to be
all right.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.000
( crying )

07:29.708 --> 07:33.166
- Take him outside.
- Elenore: Shh, shh, shh.

07:33.166 --> 07:36.750
Go, God damn it,
and get to your work.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.250
Have we no money?
Is that why they
haven't come?

07:50.250 --> 07:53.666
There was a dollar
in the tin.

07:53.666 --> 07:55.916
- Leave me be.
- Did you drink it away?

07:55.916 --> 07:58.625
- Just tell me that.
- She's my child, too.

07:58.625 --> 08:02.583
Elenore:
 The thought of her
 in potter's field.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.250
Ethan:
There'll be none of that.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.250
Quiet now.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.750
She'll rest in the yard

08:07.750 --> 08:10.083
so she's close.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.166
( tapping )

08:22.333 --> 08:24.541
Sorry. Nerves.

08:24.541 --> 08:27.208
Res ipsa loquitur.

08:29.791 --> 08:31.166
Mr. Thompson?

08:31.166 --> 08:33.832
Yes.
Thank you.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.166
Good luck.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.250
William Thompson.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.916
Robert Hodge.
Welcome.

08:56.916 --> 08:58.208
- Is it crowded out there?
- A little bit.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.375
Hypothetical--

09:03.375 --> 09:05.083
you're an assistant
US Attorney,

09:05.083 --> 09:07.083
you're prosecuting a fella,
let's call him Baker.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.833
Now, this Baker's been
arrested for petty theft,

09:08.833 --> 09:10.416
due to be released
the next morning.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.375
That night,
a detective calls,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.541
says he's certain
this is the same Baker
who's a stickup artist

09:14.541 --> 09:17.083
from Ohio wanted
for a string of robberies.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.833
What he needs
is for you to misplace
Baker's paperwork

09:18.833 --> 09:22.416
till the file
arrives from Youngstown
in two more days.

09:22.416 --> 09:26.833
If you don't
and Baker's released,
chances are he'll flee.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.041
Well?

09:28.041 --> 09:30.333
I can't do it.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.708
So he cools
his heels awhile.

09:32.708 --> 09:33.875
Three squares and a cot.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.666
That's not a bad deal
for anyone nowadays.

09:36.666 --> 09:39.666
- It's unethical, sir.
- He's an ex-jailbird.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.958
He killed a railway clerk.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.416
He left a wife
and six kids

09:42.416 --> 09:45.208
and you can't do
the police a simple favor?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.875
The law is a shield,
sir, not a sword.

09:54.208 --> 09:58.166
Holy Spirit High School,
Atlantic City.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.958
Then Temple in Philadelphia
and St. John's Law in New York.

10:00.958 --> 10:03.333
Atlantic City.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.958
I don't suppose you're related
to Nucky Thompson.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.333
He's my father's brother.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.166
That relationship is usually
classified as uncle.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.875
Well, you don't get to choose
your relatives, sir.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.833
No.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.416
But some of us get to choose
our staff members.

10:22.416 --> 10:25.250
- Mr. Hodge, I--
- Thank you for coming in.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.125
I'd tail him myself
if I had to.

10:35.125 --> 10:39.125
- What?
- Baker, your stickup man.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.416
I'd make sure he was released
in accordance with the law,

10:41.416 --> 10:42.958
but I wouldn't let him
out of my sight

10:42.958 --> 10:45.833
until the file arrived
from Youngstown.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.791
I want to be
a prosecutor, sir.

10:47.791 --> 10:49.125
I want to put
criminals in jail.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.291
The ones who
divide families.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.125
I've lost my own father,

10:53.125 --> 10:56.791
heard my mother cry
herself to sleep more times
than I can count.

10:56.791 --> 10:59.625
I know the way
crime eats you out
from the inside.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.416
I know it
and I hate it.

11:03.041 --> 11:06.291
Give me a chance, sir.
Please?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.416
Let me do something good
with my life.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.000
( music playing )

11:16.541 --> 11:19.041
"Public Enemy,"
"Little Caesar," have you
seen either of those?

11:19.041 --> 11:21.416
Comedies.
Good for a chuckle.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.125
( men laughing )

11:23.125 --> 11:24.750
Where's Mike?!

11:24.750 --> 11:25.958
He's on his way,
I guess.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.375
You guess?
Go fucking find him.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.583
- Dove?
- Where the fuck
is D'Angelo?

11:29.583 --> 11:33.083
- Where's D'Angelo?
- Where the fuck
is D'Angelo?

11:33.083 --> 11:36.625
- Where's D'Angelo?
- Had a projectionist come over,
show 'em to me and the boys.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.000
Hey, Ralphie,
what do you think?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.875
Single pleats
or double?

11:40.875 --> 11:43.166
Double.
Give the sauseech
a little breathing room.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.958
( laughing )

11:47.666 --> 11:51.125
- You heard him.
A dozen pair.
- Double pleats.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.625
Would you ever do
a picture yourself?

11:52.625 --> 11:55.000
What for?
I'm already famous.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.750
( laughing )

11:58.750 --> 12:00.291
Where the fuck's Mike?!

12:00.291 --> 12:02.125
I'm on it, Al.
I'm on it.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.250
We're on it, Al.
We're on it.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.458
- What's this for again?
- "Variety" in Hollywood.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.875
Paging Mike D'Angelo.
Paging Mike D'Angelo!

12:09.875 --> 12:11.583
In a jiffy, Al.
In a jiffy.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.708
He's coming down
the hall now, Al.

12:13.708 --> 12:16.250
Hey, he's coming down
the hall now, Al.

12:16.250 --> 12:19.916
- Two-inch cuffs.
- At your height,
an inch a half is--

12:19.916 --> 12:21.416
two inches.

12:21.416 --> 12:24.125
- Get a lot of fan mail?
- Here's Mike, Al.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.958
12 seconds with
the big boy, Mike.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.541
Don't get him
agitated.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.625
Mike, where you been?
Been asking for you.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.000
What's on
your mind, boss?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.208
- Hey!
- Sorry, sorry.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.791
- This is off the record.
- Why, sure.

12:35.791 --> 12:38.333
- Naturally.
- Ralphie, what I want
Mike for?

12:38.333 --> 12:39.333
I don't know, Al.
You didn't say.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.958
Jesus, I got
a lot on my mind.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.375
- Now, you gotta ask me.
- Actually, Al, I need
to talk to you.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.958
Last night,
6th and Springer, feds.

12:47.958 --> 12:50.125
- What?
- How bad?

12:50.125 --> 12:52.916
600 cases
Canadian Club.

12:52.916 --> 12:55.083
- Any cash?
- Just shy of 20 grand.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.166
Jesus!
Back off, Puddy!

12:57.166 --> 12:58.250
- Take a hike.
Shoo, come on.
- All right.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.083
- Get him outta here.
- Apologies!

13:00.083 --> 13:01.125
Get outta here.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.333
- Take a hike.
- Sorry.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.375
6th and Springer.
Whose territory is that?

13:04.375 --> 13:06.333
Mueller
and the other one.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.166
Atlantic City.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.000
He says he's been
making his payoffs,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.750
but this fed,
the one in charge,

13:11.750 --> 13:12.625
says he never
saw him before.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.750
How's that
Al's problem?

13:13.750 --> 13:16.083
It ain't.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.708
I just, you know,
want to make him aware.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.416
I'm aware.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.541
Those clowns
owe me 20 grand.

13:22.541 --> 13:25.375
Tell Mueller
he finds the dough

13:25.375 --> 13:28.583
or I'll sell his balls
for fucking scrap!

13:28.583 --> 13:31.083
( laughing )

13:33.916 --> 13:35.375
You were telling me
about your fan mail.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.750
Sure. Comes in
from all over the world.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.541
People looking
to make a touch.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.625
- Berlin.
- See?

13:41.625 --> 13:43.750
Even the Krauts know
what a prince I am.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.250
( laughs )

14:08.000 --> 14:10.875
- Floor, please?
- Nine.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.166
Was he upset?

14:14.166 --> 14:17.166
Al? No.
He had a big
laugh of it.

14:17.166 --> 14:19.208
- Well, that's a rel--
- Of course he was upset,
you fucking blockhead.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.416
20 grand, you think
that's peanuts?

14:22.416 --> 14:25.958
- Mr. D'Angelo, I--
- 14th floor.

14:25.958 --> 14:28.791
( whistling tune )

14:28.791 --> 14:30.750
12th, skip.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.541
Switching
to a suite.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.250
( continues whistling )

14:43.250 --> 14:45.583
- ( elevator bell dings )
- 12th floor.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.125
Have a good day.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.541
You're gonna
replace that dough.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.625
Every last cent.
You understand?

14:55.625 --> 14:58.083
- How am I supposed to do that?
- You gonna give me lip now?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.875
- No, sir.
- Figure it the fuck out.

14:59.875 --> 15:02.291
Got to be something
rattling around that
giant coconut of yours.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.375
Ninth floor.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.250
You got 24 hours,
Mueller.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.083
Going down.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.833
Well?

15:13.833 --> 15:15.541
What's he hocking
you for?

15:15.541 --> 15:16.916
You work for me,
so I'm getting the blame.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.708
What do you want
from me?

15:19.708 --> 15:21.291
I was lucky I wasn't
pinched myself.

15:21.291 --> 15:23.958
- We have to answer for this.
- I told him what happened.

15:23.958 --> 15:25.375
Some Boy Scout fed
trying to make a name
for himself.

15:25.375 --> 15:29.041
Are you deaf?
Mr. D'Angelo does
not care.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.875
Mr. Capone wants
his money.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.500
- And Mr. Mueller can go f--
- Fifth floor.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.875
Women:
Tearoom, please.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.833
( dog whining )

15:39.708 --> 15:42.166
Oh, say hello
to my Daisy.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.291
Say hello
to my Daisy.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.458
Hello, Daisy.

15:47.458 --> 15:48.791
Yeah.
There you go.

15:48.791 --> 15:53.000
Oh, isn't that nice?

15:53.000 --> 15:53.958
- Yes.
- ( elevator bell dings )

15:53.958 --> 15:56.833
Third floor.
Tearoom.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.041
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.250
Goddamn fucking money.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.041
I'll get it back, okay?

16:06.041 --> 16:07.916
You're chock-full
of promises, aren't you?

16:07.916 --> 16:09.208
I said I'd
take care of it.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.500
You can barely
take care of yourself.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.791
You reek,
by the way.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.875
Of urine.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.458
- ( elevator bell dings )
- Lobby.

16:26.208 --> 16:27.833
Going to see
the big fella.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.125
( music playing )

16:39.625 --> 16:41.958
We would summer
in Saratoga.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.416
This was when Martin
still had the factory.

16:43.416 --> 16:46.291
Hmm.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.750
I'd go up with the children
and open the house.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.916
And Martin would stay
in the city and tend
to his affairs.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.875
And I do mean that
literally.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.041
Was he that brazen?

16:58.041 --> 17:01.458
Oh, nothing
if not discreet.

17:01.458 --> 17:04.790
And the season in Saratoga
was always very gracious.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.625
We preferred
Atlantic City.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.625
My husband had
family there, so...

17:09.625 --> 17:11.790
Man on radio:
 And now it's time
 for "The Good Listener"

17:11.790 --> 17:14.500
with Mrs. Nadine St. Clair.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.125
Nadine:
 Hello, dear friends.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.665
Thank you
for joining me today.

17:18.665 --> 17:21.958
Oh, I do love a bit
of the agony aunt,
don't you?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.583
Nadine:
 In these uncertain times,

17:23.583 --> 17:25.458
wouldn't you like
to know there's someone

17:25.458 --> 17:28.000
who understands
our burdens?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.583
But, dear friends,
I hope you realize

17:30.583 --> 17:33.250
you can always
talk to me.

17:33.250 --> 17:37.041
Our first letter comes
from J.W. in Morristown.

17:37.041 --> 17:40.250
She relates
a heartbreaking tale.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.166
Unwanted pregnancy.

17:42.166 --> 17:43.291
Nadine:
 "Dear Mrs. St. Clair,

17:43.291 --> 17:45.541
for the last
three years my fiancé

17:45.541 --> 17:49.458
has promised that as soon
as his mother passed on,

17:49.458 --> 17:51.541
he would do right
by me and"--

17:51.541 --> 17:53.041
( radio turns off )

17:53.041 --> 17:54.875
Why did you do that?

17:54.875 --> 17:57.333
It doesn't create
a conducive atmosphere.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.416
I was listening.

17:58.416 --> 18:01.041
Well, you can listen
in the parlor.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.250
It's all right.
Isn't it all right?

18:03.250 --> 18:07.958
I'd like to listen.
I'd like to listen.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.375
I'd like to listen
to Nadine St. Clair.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.291
I-- I want to.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.583
I want to.
I want to.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.875
- I want to! I want to!
- ( women clamoring )

18:19.916 --> 18:22.375
( barking )

18:22.375 --> 18:24.458
I want to!

18:29.750 --> 18:33.208
- ( taps baton )
- Ladies! Ladies! Ladies!

18:33.208 --> 18:35.541
( woman whimpering )

18:35.541 --> 18:36.958
What are we here for?

18:36.958 --> 18:39.583
- ( woman whimpers )
- Hmm?

18:39.583 --> 18:42.708
To be good.

18:42.708 --> 18:44.958
Were you being good?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.875
Were you?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.750
Were you?

18:52.750 --> 18:54.750
Were you?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.083
Were you?

18:59.166 --> 19:01.208
If we're good today,
we'll be better tomorrow.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.583
And if we're better
tomorrow...

19:05.791 --> 19:08.291
Dr. Cotton is happy.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.583
Dr. Cotton is happy.

19:10.583 --> 19:14.291
And when Dr. Cotton
is happy, I'm happy.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.416
And when I'm happy...

19:21.791 --> 19:23.166
Bath time
has ended, ladies.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.208
( chatting quietly )

19:33.833 --> 19:35.208
What are you?

19:35.208 --> 19:38.041
A good girl.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.750
May I have
what I asked for?

20:07.958 --> 20:10.083
If I get
what I ask for.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.541
( jackhammer rattling )

20:25.541 --> 20:27.833
( tools buzzing )

20:36.333 --> 20:38.416
Always this noisy?

20:38.416 --> 20:41.375
- Sound of progress.
- Got a whole complex planned.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.958
Rockefeller Center.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.041
Nothing wrong with
building a shrine
to oneself.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.791
Isn't that
what money's for?

20:45.791 --> 20:48.208
( chuckles )

21:00.083 --> 21:03.041
Your Senator Lloyd
sends his regrets.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.958
He's been detained
down in Washington.

21:04.958 --> 21:07.416
( sighs )

21:07.416 --> 21:10.000
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like a few moments
of your time anyway.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.833
And why exactly
should you have it?

21:11.833 --> 21:13.791
Because as
the board members

21:13.791 --> 21:16.250
of the newly formed
Mayflower Grain Corporation,

21:16.250 --> 21:19.000
it's fairly obvious,
to me at least,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.833
that you gentlemen
are poised to enter
the liquor business.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.250
Is that so?

21:24.250 --> 21:25.625
Unless I'm wrong
and there's more potential

21:25.625 --> 21:28.125
in Wheatena than in
barley and hops.

21:28.125 --> 21:31.333
( laughs )
We agreed to meet,
Mr. Thompson,

21:31.333 --> 21:33.250
as an accommodation
to the senator.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.333
Owing to your special
relationship.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.958
But let's suppose
for the moment,

21:36.958 --> 21:39.291
for the sake of argument,
that you're right

21:39.291 --> 21:41.125
and breakfast cereal
is only half our concern.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.166
Why should
we listen to you?

21:46.750 --> 21:50.083
As a result of my recent
trip to Havana,

21:50.083 --> 21:52.750
I've secured
exclusive North American
distribution rights

21:52.750 --> 21:56.666
for Bacardi Rum.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.583
In the event the sale
of their product

21:58.583 --> 22:00.416
once again becomes legal.

22:00.416 --> 22:01.916
I propose we pool
our resources,

22:01.916 --> 22:04.666
enter into a partnership.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.375
With my experience
and know-how,

22:06.375 --> 22:07.666
we can build
an infrastructure

22:07.666 --> 22:09.541
ready to distribute
alcohol throughout--

22:09.541 --> 22:12.291
- What experience?
- Beg pardon?

22:12.291 --> 22:16.000
To what experience
are you referring?

22:17.416 --> 22:19.583
My background
is quite varied.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.625
Would you care
to elaborate?

22:21.625 --> 22:26.708
If there's any question
of my integrity,
Senator Lloyd--

22:26.708 --> 22:28.583
We're simply asking
what qualifies you to be
in the liquor business.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.000
Specifically.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.583
What qualifies me is that
for the past 11 years

22:34.583 --> 22:37.958
I have been one
of the most successful
bootleggers in the country.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.375
Oh, I see.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.833
Is there a reason
you wanted to pretend
as if you didn't know?

22:45.833 --> 22:47.666
We prefer putting
our cards on the table.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.708
- Just so we're all
on the same page.
- Nucky: Fine.

22:49.708 --> 22:53.166
The crash hit me hard
as anyone, gentlemen.

22:53.166 --> 22:57.166
I can't finance an operation
like I have in mind on my own.

22:57.166 --> 22:59.500
You're putting the cart
before the horse.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.250
We need assurances,
Mr. Thompson,

23:01.250 --> 23:05.291
that repeal actually
is on the horizon.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.625
A half million women
seem to think so,

23:07.625 --> 23:09.583
if that rally
was any indication.

23:09.583 --> 23:13.291
Women For Reform,
or whatever they
call themselves.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.333
Wanting something
and achieving it

23:16.333 --> 23:18.250
are two
very different things.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.791
Though one naturally
follows the other.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.500
We're betting
on the same thing, boys.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.083
That repeal
is going to happen.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.166
That may be true,
but without the senator--

23:25.166 --> 23:27.875
I'll get the senator
back onboard.

23:27.875 --> 23:31.416
I'm fairly certain

23:31.416 --> 23:34.166
we both know
that's not gonna happen.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.416
Charles:
We do appreciate
your coming in, however.

23:49.291 --> 23:52.416
I made the same deal,
you know.

23:52.416 --> 23:54.000
Excuse me?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.750
Across the pond.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.625
To import Dewar's
when the country returns
to its senses.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.750
Moet Champagne as well.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.291
Great minds, I suppose.

24:03.291 --> 24:05.666
Married, Mr. Thompson?

24:05.666 --> 24:08.250
Technically.
It's complicated.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.208
Well, affairs
of the heart
always are.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.083
So your partners,

24:15.083 --> 24:16.333
was that just
a vetting process

24:16.333 --> 24:19.416
or should I find some
other doorway to darken?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.375
A man like you
frightens them.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.250
These are Brahmins,
not brawlers.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.208
Well, you don't seem
particularly rattled.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.791
( chuckles )

24:26.791 --> 24:29.000
Atlantic City.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I'll ring you up
next time I visit.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.833
Mr. Thompson.

24:32.833 --> 24:35.000
Mr. Kennedy.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.750
Torrio sent word.
Maranzano wants to meet.

24:51.916 --> 24:53.916
- ( music playing )
- ( whistling )

24:53.916 --> 24:55.291
( hammering )

24:56.833 --> 24:59.708
( women laugh )

24:59.708 --> 25:02.416
Ah, afternoon, my ladies.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.625
Your royal coachman awaits.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.125
Oh, how regal.

25:06.125 --> 25:09.916
♪ Just a song
at twilight ♪

25:09.916 --> 25:14.125
♪ When the lights
are low ♪

25:14.125 --> 25:17.875
♪ And the flickering
shadows ♪

25:17.875 --> 25:19.958
♪ Softly come
and go... ♪

25:19.958 --> 25:22.916
And a serenade as well.

25:24.083 --> 25:27.166

be weary ♪

25:27.166 --> 25:30.125
♪ Sad the day

25:30.125 --> 25:34.875
♪ Still to us
at twilight... ♪

25:35.666 --> 25:38.083
Well, look
who it is.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.333
The linchpin
of the entire organization.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.250
Sorry I'm tardy, sir.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.625
So you are.
So you are.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.166
I was worried sick.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.750
Yes, sir.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.875
Actually, Lou--

25:50.875 --> 25:52.625
We're running
a business, boy.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.500
You're a critical part
of the operation.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.833
You can't just come
and go willy-nilly.

25:56.833 --> 25:58.916
- No, sir.
- You think that sand
 will sweep itself?

25:58.916 --> 26:02.541
Why, you don't show up,
this whole place descends
into chaos.

26:02.541 --> 26:05.625
The very future
of this hotel hanging
in the balance.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.000
- Maybe--
- My sister passed.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.125
- What?
- My sister, sir.

26:11.708 --> 26:15.125
She died
last night

26:15.125 --> 26:17.958
while we were
sleeping.

26:21.708 --> 26:24.750
Are there services?
A mass?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.375
I'd like to pay
my respects.

26:26.375 --> 26:27.625
No, sir.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.541
The Father came
for last rites,

26:29.541 --> 26:31.500
but we're burying
her at home.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.083
You should
send something.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.708
What for?
Kid's old man
thinks I'm a devil.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.291
He votes, don't he?

26:47.916 --> 26:50.375
A tragedy,
losing a sister.

26:53.833 --> 26:56.041
All right, then,
go on.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.833
Find solace
in your work.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.541
( music playing )

27:13.833 --> 27:16.250

27:17.833 --> 27:18.958
Say, Dad.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.708
( clatters )

27:20.708 --> 27:23.333
What is it?

27:23.333 --> 27:26.250
Why do clouds
just float in the sky?

27:28.291 --> 27:29.083
Is this a joke?

27:29.083 --> 27:31.541
It's for science class.

27:31.541 --> 27:33.666
Go ask your mother.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.250
She said to ask you.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.791
I'm busy, Chester.

27:36.791 --> 27:39.125
You can see that,
can't you?

27:43.708 --> 27:46.208
Clouds float...

27:49.083 --> 27:51.291
because of
the atmosphere.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.208
- But--
- Shoo! Upstairs.

28:01.666 --> 28:03.041
Man on radio:

28:39.250 --> 28:41.083
This is what I say.

28:41.083 --> 28:44.291
No, what you said was,
"When you will be home?"
which is entirely--

28:44.291 --> 28:46.166
What is difference?

28:46.166 --> 28:47.666
Difference is I'm trying
to raise our children

28:47.666 --> 28:49.125
to speak proper English.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.583
Where is Abigail,
by the way?

28:54.583 --> 28:57.541
At her meeting
for the Girl Scouts.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.916

Masseria,

29:40.333 --> 29:42.250
Joe the Boss,

29:42.250 --> 29:44.708
he was stubborn.

29:44.708 --> 29:46.291
Like a mule.

29:48.875 --> 29:52.250
And like a mule,
he only understood

29:52.250 --> 29:54.000
Violence.

29:55.166 --> 29:56.625
But you know this
all too well.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.083
I brought Mr. Maranzano
up to speed with your history.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.625
It's true we had
our difficulties.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.833
How many times
I try to reason
with the man?

30:07.833 --> 30:10.916
And for what?

30:10.916 --> 30:12.250
A goose egg.

30:14.416 --> 30:16.083
So why try

30:16.083 --> 30:17.750
This I did not do.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.583
I saw his partner
down in Cuba the day
before it happened.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.750
Meyer and I haven't
even spoke to each other
in months.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.208
A falling out?

30:24.208 --> 30:27.000
People drift.
Friendships end.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.208
And new ones
are forged.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.666
Mr. Lansky I've met
only once.

30:54.666 --> 30:56.750
We have no intercourse
whatsoever.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.833
Sicilians only.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.125
Meyer's got his thing,
you got yours.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.083
What we do here--

31:03.083 --> 31:05.416
Concerns no one
but us.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.458
You have nothing
to fear from me,
Mr. Thompson.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.916
Who said I was afraid?

31:22.083 --> 31:25.250
So do I believe
him or not?

31:25.250 --> 31:28.083
Believe whatever it is
gets you out of this mess.

It's the last stop
on Guzik's route.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.291
Got to be 20 grand

31:48.291 --> 31:51.166
When he comes out,
we make our move.

31:51.166 --> 31:54.166
Trust me, he won't
put up a fight.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.250
You've been apart
how long?

31:58.250 --> 31:58.833
What?

31:58.833 --> 32:02.041
From your wife.

32:02.041 --> 32:04.250
I don't know.
Jesus.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.375
Six years or so.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.625
I mean, we arrange
to see each other
now and again,

32:11.625 --> 32:13.625
but it's hard.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.416
You still care for her.

32:18.416 --> 32:22.125
Of course.
Sure.

32:22.125 --> 32:24.375
All I think about
are her and the kids.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.708
Sometimes I find it easier
to despise someone

32:31.708 --> 32:34.625
than to love them.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.958
The fuck is this guy?

32:52.125 --> 32:54.708
- Whoa, whoa. Easy!
- Eli: Give me
the fucking gun.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.166
Steady now
and no one gets hurt.

32:56.166 --> 32:58.208
You know who
you're robbing, pal?

32:58.208 --> 33:00.458
- Peter. To pay Paul.

33:01.666 --> 33:03.166
What the fuck?

33:05.333 --> 33:07.708

33:07.708 --> 33:09.083
Steady.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.291

- I said--

33:10.291 --> 33:13.541
- I said steady, God--
- ( gunshot )

33:13.541 --> 33:16.041
( groaning )

33:16.041 --> 33:17.791
- I can't move my legs.
- Fuck!

33:17.791 --> 33:21.416
- Joey! Joey!
- I'm gonna fucking
die, Jack!

33:21.416 --> 33:23.125
- Fuck! Let's go.
- My legs! My fucking legs!

33:23.125 --> 33:25.541
You're dead,
you son of a bitch!

33:25.541 --> 33:27.583
- Come on. My legs.
- That's Al Capone's money.

33:27.583 --> 33:31.458
- He fucking shot me.
I'm fucking dying.
- Joey!

33:34.416 --> 33:36.750
- No, don't shoo--
- ( gunshot )

33:37.625 --> 33:40.083
Let's go!

33:40.083 --> 33:42.458
Why must it always
be pandemonium?

33:42.458 --> 33:45.041
( music playing )

33:46.458 --> 33:48.625
You ever hear
that riddle,

33:48.625 --> 33:51.875
the traveler
and the two tribesmen?

33:51.875 --> 33:55.916
One always lies,
the other always
tells the truth.

33:57.458 --> 34:01.208
I lay down,
they come after
me again.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.125
I fight back...

34:05.625 --> 34:08.916
I met a man today,
an Irishman.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.208
Millions of dollars,
married,

34:11.208 --> 34:13.541
has his fingers in
a dozen different pies.

34:13.541 --> 34:15.291
Think he's wading through
blood to make a buck?

34:24.458 --> 34:28.041
You get to the point
where you

34:28.041 --> 34:30.166
have to live with
the choices you've made.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.875
The good ones
and the bad.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.125
And I accept that.

34:36.416 --> 34:38.583
I'm right there.
This fucking close.

34:38.583 --> 34:42.125
This liquor deal
comes through
and I'm golden.

34:42.125 --> 34:46.333
Then the trick's
to stay alive long
enough to cash out.

34:48.041 --> 34:50.041
( sighs )

34:50.041 --> 34:52.083
You haven't
the slightest idea

34:52.083 --> 34:52.500
what I'm talking
about, do you?

34:52.500 --> 34:55.750
Sí.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.125
Sí, you do,
or sí, you don't?

35:02.916 --> 35:05.916
What's the difference?

35:16.125 --> 35:18.958
If you'd have a drink,
I'd make a lot more sense.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.833
Do you have anything
to say at all?

35:31.916 --> 35:35.208
I kill them,
I don't kill them.

35:37.083 --> 35:38.166
Whatever you say.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.958
Man on radio:

 the Rhythm Boys

35:43.958 --> 35:48.291

35:54.000 --> 35:56.416
Left almost
90 minutes ago.

35:56.416 --> 35:58.250
By way of Yonkers?

35:58.250 --> 36:00.291
Maranzano probably
sent him for crullers.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.708
Who, Tonino?
He'd probably
fuck that up, too.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.750
Benny:
 Oh, the schmuck's
 already here.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.125
The fuck were you?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.708
I was here early.

36:09.708 --> 36:11.041
I figured I'd get
my knob polished.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.041
- What are you, 14?
- We're down here waiting.

36:13.041 --> 36:16.125
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.000

animal crackers?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.541
He ain't

36:22.333 --> 36:24.208
Take a walk.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.333
What's the word
on Maranzano?

36:37.333 --> 36:38.750
Is he suspicious?

36:38.750 --> 36:41.375
You know how he is.
Plays it close to the vest.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.250
Did he say anything
when you dropped him off?

36:43.250 --> 36:46.000
He says a lot of shit.
Marcus Polo.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.708
Who the fuck knows
what he's talking about?

36:47.708 --> 36:50.750
You ask me, he believes
you fellas are on the outs.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.083
Based on what?

36:52.083 --> 36:54.208
Nothing.
I don't know.
My opinion.

36:54.208 --> 36:57.166
- I don't like this,
Charlie.
- Relax.

36:57.166 --> 37:00.833
- We're jake.
- How nice you're so sure.

37:00.833 --> 37:03.208
You had to talk
to Thompson, huh?

37:03.208 --> 37:05.666
- Down in fucking Havana.
- What should I have done?

37:05.666 --> 37:07.833
Gee, maybe not
fucking talk to him?

37:07.833 --> 37:10.666
He saw me, Benny.
Better to face it head-on.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.500
( speaking Yiddish )

37:18.125 --> 37:19.875
Hey, fuck you,
you fucking screwball!

37:19.875 --> 37:21.708
Enough.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.541
As far as Maranzano knows,
Meyer took it on himself
to ice Thompson.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.625
Benny:
 Who knows what that
 fucking greaseball thinks?

37:26.625 --> 37:28.250
I say we move now.
Just take him the fuck out.

37:28.250 --> 37:31.958
It's too soon.
We don't got the support.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.958
Support?
What are we,
politicians?

37:33.958 --> 37:36.708

Prince Street.
Me taking over.

37:38.791 --> 37:41.166
I did the thing,
you said you'd think
about it.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.250
Masseria ain't even
in the fucking ground yet.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.875
I know.
I'm just reminding you.

37:49.208 --> 37:52.083
Go back upstairs.
Get yourself a rim job.

37:52.083 --> 37:54.166
What are you
sore at me for?

37:57.333 --> 37:59.291
We'll catch up
later, okay?

38:06.583 --> 38:08.916
He's a real fucking
schnorrer, this one.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.416
Yeah, he's all right.

38:11.416 --> 38:13.708
Charlie:
Tell it to Gyp Rosetti.

38:31.083 --> 38:33.208
What's this now?

38:40.791 --> 38:43.250
Ethan.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.833
What do you want?

38:45.833 --> 38:47.625
I've come to pay
my respects to you,

38:47.625 --> 38:50.375
your wife.

38:50.375 --> 38:51.833
It's a terrible blow.

38:51.833 --> 38:53.625
She's not here.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.583
Your boy told me
what happened.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.250
Is there anything worse
under God's blue heaven

38:57.250 --> 39:00.000
than the loss
of an innocent child?

39:10.208 --> 39:12.416
What's that?

39:12.416 --> 39:15.208
To give your daughter
a proper burial.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.875
Think you can
buy me twice?

39:16.875 --> 39:20.583
It was a fair deal,
Ethan.

39:20.583 --> 39:23.000
No one forced you
to sell that land.

39:38.875 --> 39:42.000
Take the day, boy.
Be with your family.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.125
Thank you, sir,
but if it's all the same,
I'd rather come to work.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.958
- Easy there.
- Pa.

39:54.958 --> 39:57.583
You get the hell
off my property.

39:57.583 --> 40:01.250
I'm not the monster
that you think I am, Ethan.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.875
( carriage leaving )

40:28.125 --> 40:30.458
( train whistle blowing )

40:37.041 --> 40:40.833
What's he like?
Hodge?

40:40.833 --> 40:42.625
Well, he's direct,

40:42.625 --> 40:44.458
tough, earnest.

40:44.458 --> 40:47.916
Sort of reminded me
of Teddy Roosevelt.

40:47.916 --> 40:50.041
Without the big stick,
I hope.

40:52.375 --> 40:56.791
In the interview
they ask you these questions,

40:56.791 --> 40:58.583
try to test
your integrity.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.500
Would you ever break the law
to get a conviction?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.125
That type of thing.

41:04.833 --> 41:07.333
My name come up?

41:07.333 --> 41:08.833
Excuse me?

41:08.833 --> 41:11.000
During the interview.

41:12.208 --> 41:12.833
No.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.125
'Course not.

41:15.125 --> 41:15.916
I wouldn't be
ashamed if it did.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.291
Well, that's very noble,

41:18.291 --> 41:19.208
but you've got a future
to think about.

41:21.083 --> 41:22.583
William H. Thompson,

41:22.583 --> 41:24.208
Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court.

41:24.208 --> 41:27.500
So long as you're not
the Attorney General
of New Jersey.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.166
( chuckles )

41:34.291 --> 41:36.666
You hardly touched
your chicken.

41:36.666 --> 41:39.208
I'm okay.

41:46.416 --> 41:49.000
I'm proud of you, Will.
We all are.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.791
Your dad would be, too.

41:56.541 --> 41:59.166
- ( music playing )
- ( man scatting )

42:03.791 --> 42:06.458
Man:
 Shut the door.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.000
- Al: Seven.
- Ralph: Six.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.666
( Al laughs )
42.

42:13.666 --> 42:16.125
- Ralph: One.
- 64.

42:16.125 --> 42:17.666
- 14.
- 72.

42:17.666 --> 42:19.541
- 42.
- 71.

42:19.541 --> 42:21.541
79.

42:21.541 --> 42:23.708
Mueller, where you been?

42:23.708 --> 42:26.166
There was an accident
on Michigan.

42:26.166 --> 42:27.750
What did you bring
for lunch?

42:32.708 --> 42:35.041
Cabbage.

42:35.041 --> 42:36.250
Watch it, Fred.

42:36.250 --> 42:37.500
There might
be a cockroach
ready to pounce.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.583
That's not funny.
There's bugs everywhere.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.916
( laughing )

42:41.916 --> 42:45.708
- 42.
- 14.

42:45.708 --> 42:48.083
- 72.
- Nine.

42:48.083 --> 42:50.208
Two fat ladies, 88.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.208
( laughing )

42:52.208 --> 42:54.791
Man:
 In closing, my friends,

42:54.791 --> 42:57.541
it's not the meek who change
the world, but the fighters,

42:57.541 --> 42:58.833
the believers.

42:58.833 --> 43:01.708
The city of Chicago
is at a great precipice,

43:01.708 --> 43:03.791
teetering on the brink
between good and evil.

43:03.791 --> 43:07.250
So I vow to fight
the Capone mob,

43:07.250 --> 43:09.583
not bow out,
not walk away,

43:09.583 --> 43:12.500
not give in,
not give up, but fight.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.833
Fight to win
for the fathers,
the mothers,

43:14.833 --> 43:16.250
and the schoolchildren
of this city.

43:16.250 --> 43:18.500
Yeah, but, Mr. Ness,
how are you gonna
go about this?

43:18.500 --> 43:20.625
And if anyone says
that to fight doesn't
get you anywhere,

43:20.625 --> 43:24.750
that a lone treasury agent
can't make a difference,

43:24.750 --> 43:27.708
that the Capone machine
is too powerful,

43:27.708 --> 43:29.000
then I say they don't
know Eliot Ness.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.125
( reporters clamoring )

43:47.666 --> 43:49.416
( knocks )

43:49.416 --> 43:50.166
- Man: Who is it?
- It's Wilson.

44:04.958 --> 44:07.125
- Making progress?
- Yes, sir.

44:07.125 --> 44:10.041
14,000 in
diamond belt buckles.

44:10.041 --> 44:11.291
Christmas gifts
for his employees.

44:11.291 --> 44:13.958
All I got was a lousy
bottle of champagne.

44:13.958 --> 44:16.666
The cathouse on Huron.

44:16.666 --> 44:18.583
I'd like a full breakdown
by morning.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.208
( music playing )

44:42.500 --> 44:45.583
Señor.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.291
Mr. Thompson,
he wants you.

44:55.625 --> 44:56.958
Thirsty?

44:56.958 --> 45:00.208
Nervous,
speaking frankly.

45:00.208 --> 45:03.291
Just a friendly conversation
in a very public place.

45:05.291 --> 45:07.583
It was the invitation
got me rattled.

45:10.250 --> 45:13.416
Don't mind him.
He's a pussycat.

45:15.083 --> 45:17.666
What do you want
to know?

45:17.666 --> 45:20.500
How about you tell me
who it was spoiled
my vacation?

45:20.500 --> 45:23.958
You know I could get killed
for just talking to you.

45:23.958 --> 45:26.791
And you will be
if you don't.

45:28.875 --> 45:30.958
It was Lansky
and Luciano.

45:30.958 --> 45:33.625
They're gonna bide their time,
let Maranzano think he's king.

45:33.625 --> 45:35.250
Then the minute
they got enough support--

45:35.250 --> 45:37.500
His reign is over.

45:37.500 --> 45:40.250
They're gonna
take me out, too.
I fucking know it.

45:42.291 --> 45:44.333
Put the knife
in my back the second
they get the chance.

45:44.333 --> 45:46.458
But you were on board
with the Masseria hit.

45:46.458 --> 45:50.041
What choice did I have?
It was go along or else.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.583
Maranzano's got
no beef with you.

45:54.583 --> 45:57.583
As far as he's concerned,
Atlantic City's yours.

45:57.583 --> 46:00.416
I can keep
what's already mine?

46:00.416 --> 46:02.250
How exceedingly generous.

46:02.250 --> 46:04.541
A lot more so
than the other two.

46:05.791 --> 46:07.250
Does Maranzano know
what they're planning?

46:07.250 --> 46:10.833
If he does,
he ain't letting on.

46:12.250 --> 46:14.291
How do you do it?

46:14.291 --> 46:17.083
Work with people
you can't trust?

46:17.083 --> 46:18.291
Is that an offer?

46:20.541 --> 46:21.208
If it were?

46:23.458 --> 46:25.875
Anything, Mr. Thompson,
I swear.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.625
I'd come work for you
in a heartbeat.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.125
Tell my man where
we can find Lansky.

46:38.125 --> 46:39.250
In the morning,
come see me.

46:41.208 --> 46:44.166
Thank you,
Mr. Thompson.
I will.

46:54.958 --> 46:56.250
Thank you, sir.

46:59.083 --> 47:01.750
- She was a lovely girl,
Billie Kent.
- Huh?

47:23.041 --> 47:26.291
( train whistle blowing )

47:34.958 --> 47:38.041
God of all mercies,

47:38.041 --> 47:41.791
You make nothing
in vain,

47:41.791 --> 47:44.666
and You love
all that You have made.

47:45.958 --> 47:48.166
Comfort us
in our grief

47:48.166 --> 47:51.333
and console us
with the knowledge

47:51.333 --> 47:53.875
of Your unfailing love.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.583
Through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

47:55.583 --> 47:57.208
Amen.

47:59.083 --> 48:01.041
Amen.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.166
Where are you going?

48:14.958 --> 48:18.125
Made your choice,
then, eh?

48:19.791 --> 48:21.291
Sir?

48:21.291 --> 48:23.666
Your boss there,
the Commodore.

48:25.166 --> 48:28.666
He said he would
bury her proper.

48:28.666 --> 48:30.583
( scoffs )

48:32.125 --> 48:34.208
Money never did
the dead no good.

48:35.791 --> 48:37.625
Fill it in.

48:38.625 --> 48:42.125
No. No.

48:42.125 --> 48:44.916
( sobbing )

48:45.958 --> 48:49.208
( train whistle blows )

48:59.041 --> 49:01.541
Man on radio:
 And now we're back with
 America's favorite family.

49:01.541 --> 49:05.000
Father:
 Ooh! What the deuce?
 Slow down.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
- ( vase shatters )
- Mother's new vase.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.625
Betsy, dear,
I told you

49:08.625 --> 49:11.208
there will be
no roller-skating
inside the house.

49:11.208 --> 49:13.625
Betsy:
 Well, I don't remember that.

49:13.625 --> 49:16.083
Father:
 I said it 100 times.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.375
Betsy:
 Well, there's your
 problem, Daddy.

49:18.375 --> 49:20.333
I can't count that high.

49:20.333 --> 49:21.958
( sobbing )

49:21.958 --> 49:23.791
- Son: Hey, Pop.
- Hello, Junior.

49:23.791 --> 49:26.041
Son:
 Say, I was hoping to borrow
 the keys to the Ford.

49:26.041 --> 49:27.375
Father:
 Why, certainly.

49:27.375 --> 49:29.041
Son:
 You mean, I can
 really take the car?

49:29.041 --> 49:31.791
Father: What car?
 I said you could
 borrow the keys.

49:31.791 --> 49:34.375
Son:
 Gee, you're not still sore
 at me, are you, Pop?

49:34.375 --> 49:36.208
Father:
 Now why on earth
 would I be sore?

49:36.208 --> 49:38.000
Son:
 On account I dented
 the fender?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.916
- Father: You did?
- Son: No, but don't
 you feel better now?

49:40.916 --> 49:43.125
( audience laughing,
applauding )

49:43.125 --> 49:45.166
( music playing )

49:47.291 --> 49:50.000
- Woman: I'm red.
- Woman #2: No, I'm red.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
- I'm red.
- Started already
 right over here.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.500
- No, I'm red.
- I'm red.

49:53.500 --> 49:57.458
- Don't touch.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

49:57.458 --> 49:59.916
- Give me that back.
- Ladies. Ladies.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.958
- I'm red.
- Sorry.

50:01.958 --> 50:04.083
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

50:15.958 --> 50:18.291
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

50:18.291 --> 50:19.750
I say what goes here.

50:19.750 --> 50:22.083
Understand?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
You have a lovely figure.

51:12.833 --> 51:15.708
( sniffs )

51:17.500 --> 51:18.583
New Year's Eve.

51:18.583 --> 51:21.916
I wore this at
the Hotel Excelsior.

51:23.125 --> 51:24.666
Paul Whiteman played.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.791
Does it flatter me?

51:40.375 --> 51:43.208
Some tailoring,
perhaps.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.041
Lower the hemline.

52:12.583 --> 52:15.833
Could you not get
proper stationery?

52:15.833 --> 52:18.541
I'm risking my job
as it is.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.583
No crazy letters
to the president, now.

52:24.208 --> 52:27.375
Why would you think
I would do that?

52:27.375 --> 52:30.083
'Cause you're
in the booby hatch, honey.

52:30.083 --> 52:32.166
That's why no pen
and paper is allowed.

52:32.166 --> 52:36.708
I did something wrong.
I know that.

52:38.333 --> 52:40.125
But the doctor said
I needed to be looked after.

52:45.458 --> 52:47.375
I just--
it's all a jumble.

52:47.375 --> 52:49.250
I just--

52:49.250 --> 52:50.916
I need to get
my thoughts straight.

52:50.916 --> 52:53.916
( music playing )

52:57.416 --> 52:59.291
( chatter )

53:06.416 --> 53:07.875
Make sure
you cork the rum.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.500
- Fella found a fruit fly--
- ( woman screaming )

53:13.750 --> 53:16.291
- Woman: Oh, help!
- Woman #2: Oh, my God!

53:16.291 --> 53:19.000
- ( tires squeal )
- Man: He's going down there!

53:19.000 --> 53:21.708
It's the black one.
The Buick.

53:21.708 --> 53:23.875
Get the car.
Get the car!

53:23.875 --> 53:25.083
Man #2:
 Take her out of here.
All right, come on, let's go.

53:25.083 --> 53:26.750
Turn around.
Let's go.

53:26.750 --> 53:29.333
Man #3:
 Hey, ladies, come on.
 Come on, get out of here.

53:29.333 --> 53:32.333
- ( music playing )
- ( whistling )

53:33.791 --> 53:36.708
