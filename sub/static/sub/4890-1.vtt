00:31.949 --> 00:34.022
All set, Charlie.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.399
Hey, Pa!

00:44.127 --> 00:45.699
Whoa.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.800
Hey, Pa, you got time for
a game before supper?

00:50.801 --> 00:54.045
Go get your ball.
I'll meet you out back.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.055
Okay, Roy.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.551
Come on, I want to see
some smoke on this one.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.475
- Whoa! Okay!
- Yeah!

01:13.490 --> 01:15.658
Son, you put that in a bottle,

01:15.659 --> 01:18.232
you got something
sweeter than Yoo-hoo.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.741
Whoa! Beauty!

01:23.250 --> 01:25.751
You got a great gift, Son.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.296
It's as if angels
came down from heaven

01:28.297 --> 01:31.549
and put a blessing on your
three bowling digits.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.386
You can apply everything that
I've taught you about bowling

01:35.387 --> 01:37.346
to your daily life.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.725
And if you do that,
you're gonna be decent,

01:40.726 --> 01:42.685
you're gonna be moral,

01:42.686 --> 01:45.339
you're gonna be a good man.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.415
Well, all set, guys.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.641
Can you believe this?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.894
Me on the professional bowling tour?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.218
It's your calling, Son.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.484
One day, when people
say the name "Munson,"

03:55.485 --> 03:58.320
they're gonna think "winner."

03:58.321 --> 04:01.323
Just like DiMaggio is to baseball,

04:01.324 --> 04:03.567
or Unitas is to football.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.578
That's what Munson
will be to bowling.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.621
- That's right, Roy.
- Yeah, Roy.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.571
I hope so, Dad.
I want to make you proud.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.085
Hey, Roy.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.505
Maybe you can get this
old piece of crap working,

04:17.507 --> 04:20.384
or if you get in a pinch,

04:20.385 --> 04:23.664
maybe you'll get a
couple of bucks for it.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.007
Thanks, Dad.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.607
You go get them, Son.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.260
I will.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.089
It all comes down to this roll.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.550
Roy Munson, a man-child,

05:01.551 --> 05:05.137
with a dream to topple bowling
giant, Ernie McCracken.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.088
If he strikes, he's the
1979 Odor-Eaters champion.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.728
He's got one foot in the frying pan
and one in the pressure cooker.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.647
Believe me, as a bowler, I know,

05:14.648 --> 05:19.902
that right about now your bladder feels
like an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag,

05:19.903 --> 05:24.281
and your butt is kind of like
an about-to-explode bratwurst.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.811
Hey! Do you mind? I wasn't
talking when you were bowling.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.280
Was I talking out loud?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.574
Was I?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.285
Sorry.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.198
Good luck.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.455
Yeah!

06:00.318 --> 06:02.570
Munson! Munson!

06:02.571 --> 06:06.225
Munson! Munson! Munson! Munson!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.529
Big problem, my friend.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.661
- Engine blown.
- Engine blown?

06:20.422 --> 06:23.007
Someone put sugar in your tank.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.760
- Sugar? That's impossible.
- Here. Here. Sugar.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.847
Maybe it's the bad kids around here.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.851
- How much is it gonna cost to fix?
- $2,000.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.880
$2,000? That's gonna wipe me out.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.484
I'm sorry. Did I wake you, Fatima?

06:42.485 --> 06:45.889
- Ethyl supreme. Top it off, please.
- Right away.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.991
Watch the door.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.077
Hey, pinhead, juice the
tires for me, will you?

06:52.078 --> 06:55.823
Today. Oh, Roy.
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

06:56.708 --> 07:01.238
- Hi, Mr. McCracken.
- Hey, call me Ernie or Big Ern, huh?

07:02.547 --> 07:06.508
For a young bowler like yourself,
the tour can be very difficult.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.093
Very expensive.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.178
Tanqueray and Tab.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.472
Keep them coming, sweets.
I got a long drive.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.307
Do me a favor, will you?

07:13.308 --> 07:14.516
Would you mind washing
off that perfume

07:14.517 --> 07:17.811
before you come back to our table?

07:17.812 --> 07:23.264
A little bad luck, like you had here today,
all of your dreams can go up in smoke.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.487
That's why even we veteran bowlers,

07:26.488 --> 07:29.114
we work our way,
tournament to tournament.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.859
We need the supplemental income.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.411
Supplemental income?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.622
- Supplemental.
- Supplemental.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.742
Yeah, it's extra.
That's what it means.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.627
You interested?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.712
- Interested?
- Interested.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.117
Would you be interested
in some extra income?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.760
Extra income?

07:49.761 --> 07:52.129
Want to make more money?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.795
Okay.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.888
Why don't you go eat that outside
and then come on back in?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.111
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.764
Not you.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.231
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.211
God, do people actually bowl here?

08:24.212 --> 08:27.840
They live here. They die here.
They get their mail here.

08:27.841 --> 08:32.496
I don't know about this, Mr. McCracken.
Something doesn't seem right.

08:33.429 --> 08:38.336
Well, it takes guts to say no, kid.
You got a lot of courage.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.644
I don't think I could
call my mommy and daddy

08:40.645 --> 08:44.273
and tell them I didn't have what
it takes to make it on the tour.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.442
All right, let's get going.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.778
Better call them before they
go to sleep. Come on, hurry up.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.353
- All right.
- Nice flip-flop. Way to go.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.751
Two more for me and my friend here.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.794
I got it in the nose.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.448
Here, just take it out of that.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.299
Say there, buddy,

09:10.300 --> 09:13.203
you gonna buy the beers
or the whole place?

09:13.803 --> 09:14.970
No, I...

09:14.971 --> 09:17.264
This is just my bonus.
I had a good month.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.640
A good month.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.311
This punk shattered
my monthly record.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.147
I had the entire company
record, 21%. Just shattered.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.815
Look at this bonus they gave him.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.763
What do you fellows sell?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.069
- Dictionaries.
- Dictionaries.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.222
Yeah. Door to door.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.744
Hey, what do you say,
we play a couple of games?

09:38.745 --> 09:40.662
- Maybe 20 bucks a game?
- Oh, no.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.332
No, you're not gonna
bowl drunk again.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.750
But I insist.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.377
What do you want to risk?
You have everything going for you.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.130
You're on a gravy train
with biscuit wheels.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.175
You've just shattered my record.
What do you want to go and lose it for?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.250
This is a Gran Torino
looking at you here.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.763
Don't do it, okay?

09:57.764 --> 10:01.043
Let's just have six or
seven drinks and go.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.637
Hey, buddy boy.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.190
You looking for a
little friendly action,

10:08.191 --> 10:11.936
I just might know somebody
to accommodate you.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.948
Speak of the devil, and he appears.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.976
I'm gonna play the jukebox.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.699
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.597
God!

10:40.598 --> 10:42.375
God!

10:43.143 --> 10:45.602
- Oh, yeah.
- He was robbed and you know it.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.938
Game, set, match, fellas.

10:47.939 --> 10:52.970
Yeah, and I believe you
owe us another $100.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.363
Well, we're not getting
much mercy here tonight.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.532
Well, you guys got to forgive me.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.937
You see, bowling for money,
it's my only vice.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.527
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks, sugar.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.420
Okay, two vices.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.744
That's still very good.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.341
All right, let's go.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.385
Thank you for the
education, gentlemen.

11:18.386 --> 11:22.431
We've just received a Ph.D.
in stupidity. Doctor, shall we?

11:22.432 --> 11:25.726
Give us a chance to
win our money back.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.270
Are you crazy?

11:28.271 --> 11:31.148
Padre, how much are you
into us for already?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.641
$350.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.026
$350.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.362
That's a landau roof and power
steering, down the drain.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.032
It could be in your pocket
right now. Let's go.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.992
Double or nothing,
I can pick up that spare.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.786
- I can... I think I can do it.
- That's the six, seven, ten.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.873
You'll pick up that spare the same
day my hair starts falling out.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.708
Come on, let's get out of here.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.586
- I can do this.
- For $700? No way.

11:52.587 --> 11:56.298
No. No way. No, not for $700.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.967
What have you got here?
1,500. For $1,500.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.678
Guys, you want some of the
"action," as he calls it?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.430
Come on, you chickenshits.
I'm good for the money.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.514
Put up my share.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.974
Now, Mr. Big Shot.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.309
Mr. I-wear-my-pants-high

12:07.310 --> 12:09.770
and-I-pick-up-every-spare
drunk-or-sober.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.063
Come on, guys.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.773
All right, we'll take that bet.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.650
Fine, my friend, my so-called friend.

12:14.651 --> 12:18.320
Take your silly little ball and
make your silly little spare,

12:18.321 --> 12:20.064
or miss it!

12:20.657 --> 12:22.809
Come on, boy. Bowl!

12:23.826 --> 12:26.119
The name's not boy.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.817
It's Roy.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.617
Roy Munson.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.337
How did he do that?

12:44.305 --> 12:48.585
What did I tell you? What did
I tell you? What did I tell you?

12:50.061 --> 12:53.715
This feels weird.
Are you sure this is legal?

12:54.023 --> 12:57.097
I don't know. It's fun,
though, isn't it?

13:01.531 --> 13:04.775
What do you have sugar
for, Mr. McCracken?

13:07.912 --> 13:12.237
Didn't I tell you to call
me Ernie or Big Ern?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.948
It's for my morning coffee.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.998
Get out of the car, wise guy!

13:19.507 --> 13:20.590
What do we do?

13:20.591 --> 13:24.165
Sometimes a bowler just
has to face the music.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.212
Come on. There you are. Let's go.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.504
And that bowler is you, Roy.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.068
You're in deep shit, kid!

13:40.069 --> 13:43.071
Look, look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.270
Let me see that hand.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.328
Yeah, I thought I
recognized that name.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.955
- Father, please do something.
- Oh, yeah.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.916
I'm a priest like you're
a dictionary salesman,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.960
you piece of shit.
Come on, get him inside.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.588
Come on. No, don't do this.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.964
No!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.674
No!

14:02.675 --> 14:04.718
What are you doing?

14:04.719 --> 14:08.096
I'll pay you back,
I swear to God. I swear.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.057
- Get him up there.
- No, no, no!

14:10.058 --> 14:11.183
No!

14:11.184 --> 14:12.642
No!

14:12.643 --> 14:14.853
- No!
- Do it!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.271
No!

14:16.272 --> 14:17.673
God! No!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.524
No!

14:19.525 --> 14:21.768
- Do it.
- No!

15:23.339 --> 15:25.616
Hey, Herb, how's life?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.043
Taking forever.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.163
Morning, Mike.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.759
Roy, can you get sick drinking piss?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.845
I think you can.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.762
Even if it's your own?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.932
Hey, Captain Hook, wait up.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.935
Hey!

15:54.203 --> 15:57.982
I want that rent by tomorrow,
or you are out of here!

16:40.249 --> 16:43.376
Okay, I got you down for a
50-gallon drum of lane oil

16:43.377 --> 16:45.253
and a case of bowler's tape...

16:45.254 --> 16:47.214
Every week I tell you the same thing,

16:47.215 --> 16:49.208
we don't need nothing.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.387
What about a gross of
fluorescent condoms

16:54.388 --> 16:56.097
for the novelty machine
in the men's room?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.934
I mean, those are fun
even when you're alone.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.101
- Yeah.
- You get it?

17:00.102 --> 17:01.937
- Yeah.
- This is like the hula-hoop of the '90s.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.063
- People go nuts...
- No!

17:03.064 --> 17:05.397
Look, we don't even
have a novelty machine

17:05.398 --> 17:07.847
in the men's room anymore.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.347
And you call this a bowling alley?

17:26.628 --> 17:29.256
You stroke a hell of a ball,

17:29.257 --> 17:32.926
but I bet when you're off,
you leave a lot of buckets.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.135
Excuse me.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.805
Buckets, three, five, six and nine.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.515
It's from coming in too
light in the pocket

17:38.516 --> 17:41.795
and sending the head
pin around the three.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.469
You could tell all that from
just seeing me throw one strike?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.805
I didn't see it. I heard it.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.145
Try moving a couple
of boards to the left.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.122
Would you look at that?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.916
Sweeter than Yoo-hoo.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.546
How come you know so
much about bowling?

18:17.930 --> 18:21.016
Well, maybe this'll
help explain it to you.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.795
Oh, wow. That's really something.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.771
- What's that made out of?
- 14-karat gold.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.220
Really? Looks like rubber.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.474
No, the ring, not the hand.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.062
Wow, state champion.

18:38.409 --> 18:42.234
- You the state champion?
- Was. Iowa, '79.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.080
Name's Roy Munson.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.983
Ishmael Boorg.

18:47.376 --> 18:51.254
You know, you've got as powerful
a stroke as I've ever seen, Ishmael.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.883
You could lose a little off the
backswing, but you're not bad.

18:54.884 --> 18:59.554
- What's your average?
- I don't know. 265, 270.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.848
Well, I got to go.

19:01.849 --> 19:05.226
- Bye.
- Whoa. Hey, easy does it.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.729
What's your hurry?
We're just getting acquainted.

19:07.730 --> 19:11.733
You're wasting your time, Munson.
He's from way out in Brimfield.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.068
So?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.570
Brimfield's an Amish community.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.099
- He's Amish?
- No fooling you.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.439
Hey!

19:26.040 --> 19:28.124
Hey, wait up. I want to
talk to you for a second.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.902
About what?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.046
You got something special.

19:33.047 --> 19:36.549
With your talent and my knowledge,
you could be a champion.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.926
I mean that.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.581
And I know talent because
I manage bowlers.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.917
Bowling manager?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.753
Why would a bowler need a manager?

19:49.063 --> 19:53.138
"Why would a bowler need a manager?"

19:53.401 --> 19:57.570
Well, don't you need a coach,

19:57.571 --> 20:00.315
a friend, a brother,

20:00.908 --> 20:04.577
someone who's gonna stick by
your side through thick and thin,

20:04.578 --> 20:06.913
someone who will be a loyal friend,

20:06.914 --> 20:12.286
and never, ever, ever turn
on you, no matter what?

20:15.047 --> 20:18.371
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm
just not interested.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.555
I hope you rot in hell, you loser!

20:23.556 --> 20:25.208
You suck!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.384
You don't deserve a car!

20:34.483 --> 20:37.444
Where's the milk for the coffee?

20:37.445 --> 20:39.392
We're all out.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.897
Well, what do you call
that in the cooler?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.247
Well, if you want to buy
some, help yourself,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.499
but the freebies are all out.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.001
Buy some?

20:53.002 --> 20:56.030
What, I got to pay for
mustard if I get a hotdog?

20:57.715 --> 21:00.243
If the freebies are out, yeah.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.506
Can you break a 20?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.926
And give me a box of Marlboros.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.358
Do I got to pay for matches?

21:17.359 --> 21:20.387
Five, five's ten. Here's 20.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.642
If you ever need to
just talk, call me.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.748
- Can I help you here?
- Thanks.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.526
Come on up.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.116
- Absolutely precious.
- Yeah.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.716
That will come out.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.302
Treasure these special times.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.252
Look at you.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.460
Did you burn your little fingers?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.465
- Adorable.
- Thanks.

22:02.738 --> 22:06.017
Charge me for milk, will you?
You lowlife.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.067
- Give me the pocketbook, lady.
- No.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.664
- Give me it.
- No.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.374
- Hey!
- Give me it!

22:14.375 --> 22:15.901
Okay.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.420
Give it back. What are you,
a sissy? You need a purse?

22:19.421 --> 22:21.744
I'll slice your throat.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.842
Shit!

22:23.843 --> 22:26.427
You burned me, you bastard.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.180
Go ahead, you chickenshit.
Run home to mommy.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.753
Pussy!

22:31.225 --> 22:33.184
Here you go.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.978
You okay?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.722
I'm fine.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.883
I am fine.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.320
That was a very brave thing
that you did, Munson.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.614
You are a hero,

22:46.615 --> 22:48.324
a genuine hero.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.702
I'm no hero. I don't
even know what happened.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.858
Nine out of 10 times, I'd be
running in the other direction.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.376
You know, about the rent...

22:58.377 --> 23:00.628
No, no, no, don't you
worry about that, Roy.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.088
You pay me the money
whenever you get it,

23:02.089 --> 23:04.958
'cause I know you are good for it.

23:05.509 --> 23:09.209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You thank you.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.264
What 50? We said 25.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.891
I think I deserve a little extra

23:12.892 --> 23:15.602
after getting third-degree
burns on my pupils.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.854
Hey, look, I didn't know you
were gonna use a knife.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.857
I'm just trying to buy a little extra time.
I don't want to give her a coronary.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.026
I had to make it look real, didn't I?

23:23.027 --> 23:26.351
Look, besides,
that coffee wasn't even hot.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.699
- Now that's hot.
- Where's your newspaper?

23:29.700 --> 23:31.701
- I got to take a dump.
- I don't have a paper.

23:31.702 --> 23:36.331
- I got to crap. I need something to read.
- Here, use this shampoo.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.916
"New and improved."
I read this already.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.752
You got any of that new Mentadent?

23:40.753 --> 23:45.784
Roy, I know how you like to drink,
so I brought you some...

23:49.053 --> 23:53.723
Why, you no good son of a bitch!

23:53.724 --> 23:56.893
You crazy bastard! Well,
how the hell did you get in here?

23:56.894 --> 24:00.313
- Now get out!
- That'll be 100 now, you prick!

24:00.314 --> 24:02.941
And don't come back!

24:02.942 --> 24:04.734
- Munson!
- Some people never learn. I...

24:04.735 --> 24:06.486
You are history!

24:06.487 --> 24:08.764
I am calling the cops!

24:11.575 --> 24:13.326
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Hey.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.079
Now, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.415
You have every right
to be angry, okay?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.284
Just take a deep breath.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.754
No.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.048
There's got to be some
way I can work this off.

24:27.049 --> 24:31.170
- Some way I can make it up to you.
- No, no, no, no, no! No!

24:36.934 --> 24:38.677
Well...

24:48.570 --> 24:51.598
Stop it, you. It wasn't that bad.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.686
My little Roy-toy.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.700
What is it about good sex
that makes me have to crap?

25:03.043 --> 25:05.571
Guess it's all that pumping.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.868
Pump and dump.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.420
You really jarred
something loose, tiger.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.841
Oh, boy.

25:21.311 --> 25:25.106
I got two bits of
advice for you, Munson.

25:25.107 --> 25:28.026
Number one, why don't you forget
about this bowling business

25:28.027 --> 25:30.600
and get yourself a real job?

25:33.615 --> 25:36.743
Number two, you still owe
me another month's rent.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.869
So if I were you,

25:37.870 --> 25:41.865
I would start doing some tongue
exercises before Friday.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.890
Top of the morning to you.
I'm Hezakiah Munson.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.684
I'm passing through
on my way to Ohio.

26:43.685 --> 26:47.009
Any shingling or butter
churning need doing?

26:55.030 --> 26:58.449
Lucas, you know better than that.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.445
We're waiting on your brother
to come in from the fields.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.619
How many children do you
have, Brother Hezakiah?

27:12.673 --> 27:14.165
None that I know of.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.886
What I mean to say is I was...

27:18.887 --> 27:21.639
We... I'm unable to have children.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.840
Nasty cheese grating
accident as a young man.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.983
Why are you late this time, Ishmael?

27:31.984 --> 27:36.154
Sorry, Pa. I was out in the cornfield,
and the stalks were broken,

27:36.155 --> 27:38.197
and so I thought I could fix it.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.020
Hi, Grandma.

27:44.496 --> 27:49.823
Ishmael, please meet our friend
from Ohio, Brother Hezakiah.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.991
Hello, Ishmael.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.555
Why did you come here?

28:02.556 --> 28:04.724
We didn't get a chance
to finish talking.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.560
You're only gonna
make trouble for me.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.383
Have a seat.

28:11.231 --> 28:15.443
Look, my grandfather took
me bowling when I was a kid.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.236
It was our secret.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.780
If anyone around here found out that
I went down to that bowling alley,

28:19.781 --> 28:22.033
I don't know what would happen.

28:22.034 --> 28:26.689
Ishmael, there's a tournament
in Reno, Nevada in a few weeks.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.498
The best bowlers in the
country are gonna be there.

28:29.499 --> 28:33.904
With my help, I think you
can beat them. You hear me?

28:34.129 --> 28:36.797
First prize is $1 million.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.371
We split everything
right down the middle.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.638
No, sir. I think it's
best that you go.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.724
By tomorrow, they'll surely
find out that you're a fraud.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.344
We Amish, we demand
more of ourselves.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.979
You people work 8-hour days.
We work 12.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.107
We do whatever you people do
plus a half. That's how we survive.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.682
Believe me, keeping up is
not gonna be a problem.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.578
Pa, his bed's made,
but he isn't in there.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.026
He must've left.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.334
Guess Brother Hezakiah was afraid
of getting his fingers dirty.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.419
Morning! I hope you don't mind.

29:15.420 --> 29:19.382
I got up a little early, so I took the
liberty of milking your cow for you.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.509
Yeah, it took a little while
to get her warmed up.

29:21.510 --> 29:25.039
She sure is a stubborn one.
Then, pow! All at once.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.641
We don't have a cow.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.589
We have a bull.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.969
I'll brush my teeth.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.677
Ishmael, you take Lucas down
with the other children.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.721
Keep an eye on them for us, please.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.307
Brother Hezakiah, you come with us.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.643
The children? But I wanted
to help with the barn.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.547
You can help after lunch. Go ahead.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.185
Grab your tools. Follow me.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.429
I don't know how a
barn-raising's done in Ohio,

31:30.430 --> 31:32.223
but here in Pennsylvania,

31:32.224 --> 31:33.974
no one runs for the dinner bell

31:33.975 --> 31:37.049
in the middle of lifting
a 2,000 pound wall!

31:37.687 --> 31:40.135
Okay, all right. I mean...

31:42.401 --> 31:44.652
Brother Thomas, you know
what it says in the Bible

31:44.653 --> 31:46.851
about not forgiving people.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.146
Why don't you tell us all what
it says, Brother Hezakiah?

31:53.703 --> 31:55.946
Well, it's against it.

32:02.129 --> 32:06.590
Yeah, sure, Thomas can raise a barn,
but can he pick up a 7-10 split?

32:06.591 --> 32:11.087
God blessed my brother to be
a good carpenter. It's okay.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.348
Yeah, well, he blessed you, too,
and I'll give you a clue what it is.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.351
It's round, it has three holes,
and you stick your fingers into it.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.895
You leave Rebecca
out of this, mister!

32:19.896 --> 32:23.015
I'm talking about
bowling, your future.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.693
Well, just drop it, Mr. Munson.

32:25.694 --> 32:29.155
Right now, the only future I
have is re-shoeing Buttercup.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.615
Holy cow.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.659
Yeah, this is Buttercup.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.358
Biggest, strongest
horse in the county.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.123
Ishmael, like a word with you.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.026
Okay, Pa.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.465
Brother Hezakiah,
take the horse's shoes off.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.994
Ishmael will be right back.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.044
Don't be angry with
your brother, Thomas.

32:59.394 --> 33:03.564
He's been under a lot of pressure
dealing with those bankers.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.387
Is everything okay, Pa?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.110
No, Son.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.605
The community's in trouble.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.782
They've threatened to
foreclose on the land.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.452
Is there anything I can do?

33:16.453 --> 33:20.608
Not unless you can figure out a way
to come up with a half million dollars.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.910
Well, there's a storm on the horizon.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.076
I guess the angels are bowling.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.918
Maybe they're gonna
bring us a messenger.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.478
It took some doing,
but I finally got them off.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.722
Where do you keep the new shoes?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.526
What, I got a...

33:48.527 --> 33:51.350
I got a booger hanging? Huh?

33:54.533 --> 33:58.994
Tell my parents that God spoke to me
to go on a mission with Brother Munson.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.080
If the good Lord sees fit,

34:01.081 --> 34:04.833
I'll be back with enough
money to save the land.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.835
Ishmael, promise me

34:06.836 --> 34:09.547
that you'll be careful when
you're out among the English.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.246
Do not allow yourself
to be corrupted.

34:12.425 --> 34:16.469
Don't worry, Miss Rebecca,
your goodness gives me strength.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.965
Nothing can make me stray.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.069
Buckle up, my friend.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.349
You're about to embark
on a great adventure.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.492
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.754
You really should try
to quit, Mr. Munson.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.674
They say it's bad for
your heart, your lungs,

34:53.675 --> 34:55.551
quickens the aging process.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.095
Is that right? Who's done
more research on the subject

34:58.096 --> 35:01.515
than the good people at the
American tobacco industry?

35:01.516 --> 35:03.267
They say it's harmless.
Why would they lie?

35:03.268 --> 35:06.012
If you're dead, you can't smoke.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.778
You get warmed up.
I'll grab us a couple coffees.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.197
I don't drink coffee.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.021
- Why not?
- Because it's a stimulant.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.068
What the hell do you
think cigarettes are?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.490
They are?

35:29.461 --> 35:32.080
All right. Make it extra-large,
two sugars, lots of cream.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.036
Lots of cream.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.514
Mr. Munson, you all right?

35:52.150 --> 35:55.520
Ish, what happened in there?

35:56.446 --> 35:59.448
Well, I don't know.
I thought I played pretty good.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.785
You know, he's just a little
better than me, that's all.

36:02.786 --> 36:06.156
Pretty good, huh? 186.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.527
You lost to a club player!

36:11.169 --> 36:15.089
What... That's not supposed to happen!
You're carrying a 270 average!

36:15.090 --> 36:19.415
Well, what do you expect?
I mean, you guys with your 10 frames.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.013
What do you mean
"you guys with your 10 frames"?

36:23.014 --> 36:26.225
My grandpa always taught
me to bowl 15 frames.

36:26.226 --> 36:27.559
It's like I told you before,

36:27.560 --> 36:30.688
we Amish, we do everything
half again as hard as you do.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.523
Ten frames?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.801
That's for Quakers.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.432
I ain't going home.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.778
Look, there's no way you'd stand
a chance against those guys.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.707
But you said I was the best
prospect you'd ever seen.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.625
You said you could
make me a champion.

36:51.626 --> 36:56.748
I've been liquored up for 17 years.
My judgment's not what it once was.

36:59.759 --> 37:03.095
Pull the car over.
I want to get out here.

37:03.096 --> 37:06.306
- I'll drive you home.
- I don't want to go home!

37:06.307 --> 37:08.434
I want to go to Reno!

37:08.435 --> 37:11.463
Now, pull the car over
and let me out of here!

37:15.233 --> 37:16.734
You know, this is silly.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.571
You've only been gone a couple
of days. They'll forgive you.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.098
Yeah.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.269
Yeah, you're right, Mr. Munson.
They'll probably forgive me.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.996
They expect me to come home
with my tail between my legs,

37:28.997 --> 37:30.873
but I won't do it.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.917
I'd sooner get munsoned out
here in the middle of nowhere

37:33.918 --> 37:36.462
than lose face in front of
my friends and family again.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.588
What'd you just say?

37:37.589 --> 37:40.132
I said I don't want to lose face
in front of my friends and family.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.534
No, before that.

37:41.676 --> 37:46.221
I said I'd sooner get munsoned
out here in the middle of nowhere.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.874
"Munsoned"?

37:48.767 --> 37:52.019
- What the hell is that?
- You know, munsoned.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.854
To be up a creek without a paddle.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.689
To have the whole world
in the palm of your hand

37:55.690 --> 37:59.435
and then blow it, you know.
It's a figure of speech.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.266
"Munsoned."

38:19.964 --> 38:23.163
Congratulations, my friend.
You passed the test.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.997
A true champion doesn't
quit, and neither did you.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.967
- You mean, you were just testing me?
- A little Roy 101.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.052
You were just testing me.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.488
Mr. Munson.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.232
Whoa!

38:48.243 --> 38:50.236
Come on, hop in.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.613
I got to watch you.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.168
So, I did good, huh?

38:58.169 --> 39:01.288
You did great,
but school's just beginning.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.559
I'm telling you,
a bowler's two worst enemies

39:13.560 --> 39:15.644
are his eyes and his ears.

39:15.645 --> 39:19.640
You shut these, you close those,
and you just feel it.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.259
Hey. Hey, coach, listen to this.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.710
"English bulldog,
one testicle, $500."

40:34.641 --> 40:37.935
Wow. For that kind of money,
you think you'd get two testicles.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.436
Don't you think?

40:39.437 --> 40:41.313
How the hell should I know, Ishmael?

40:41.314 --> 40:43.357
I'm tired of all your questions.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.985
I'm not here to teach you everything
about everything in the world.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.572
I'm here to teach you about
bowling, and that's it.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.943
Okay, okay, keep your shirt on.

40:54.786 --> 40:58.360
I mean, I can figure some
things out for myself.

41:10.343 --> 41:12.469
Wait a minute. Hold it.
I'm gonna bet?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.763
Yeah, well, if we're gonna make
enough dough to get to Reno,

41:14.764 --> 41:16.837
we're gonna bet. Yeah.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.478
Ish, you can't have it both ways.

41:21.479 --> 41:25.148
If you want to earn half a million dollars
and save that small town of yours,

41:25.149 --> 41:27.526
you're gonna have to
bend the rules a little.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.821
No way. There's no way I can bet.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.322
It's against my religion.

41:32.323 --> 41:36.034
I was raised to not be a gambler,
and there's no way I'm gonna bet.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.495
- Hey. Hey! Ish. Ish!
- No. No!

41:38.496 --> 41:39.913
- Hey!
- No way.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.790
Listen, you stupid banana head.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.418
You don't have to bet!
I'll bet for you.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.336
That's cool.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.866
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen, huh?

41:54.178 --> 41:56.797
So, you two are dictionary salesmen.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.590
You would be punctilious
in assuming that.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.520
Yeah, your buddy tells me
you're the best salesman

42:03.521 --> 42:05.188
in the whole company.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.092
You must be a pretty smooth talker.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.061
Yeah. Yep.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.772
You don't have to read them
to sell them, you know.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.656
So, Steve, what do you say
we bowl a couple games?

42:22.707 --> 42:24.279
Steve?

42:25.585 --> 42:27.612
Yo, Steve-arino.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.365
Right.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.959
Okay, you want to bowl
for some big money, hey?

42:34.385 --> 42:38.710
But I'll lose my entire bonus
check 'cause I'm so bombed.

42:41.059 --> 42:44.303
You get that way when
you drink ginger ale?

42:45.271 --> 42:49.175
Oh, no. He was sniffing
glue in the parking lot.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.361
I haven't heard this one in a while.

42:53.362 --> 42:56.390
How does the rest
of this hustle work?

42:58.534 --> 43:00.619
Nice going, De Niro.

43:00.620 --> 43:02.237
It's Steve.

43:02.371 --> 43:05.399
What, you want to
blow the whole thing?

43:06.209 --> 43:09.544
Look, if you guys want a
straight-up money game,

43:09.545 --> 43:11.838
you show up at this address tonight.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.007
At midnight.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.206
And bring some money.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.381
Wow. Look at that.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.092
Are you all right, sir?

43:27.396 --> 43:30.273
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just make sure you win.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.566
We can't lose.

43:31.567 --> 43:35.312
It's the centurion's faith
that wins him divine favor.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.074
Got you!

43:39.075 --> 43:42.649
Okay, park the shitbox and
come with me. Come on.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.196
He seems like a real cutup, huh?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.710
You know, Stanley,

43:50.711 --> 43:54.798
I don't necessarily feel like we
need to play for money, you know.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.633
Why don't we just play for fun?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.677
- Every once in a while...
- Cut the bullshit, Munson.

43:58.678 --> 44:01.627
I know you're a hustler.
Now, can your kid play or not?

44:03.724 --> 44:05.546
He can play.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.519
Fine.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.718
Then it's $1,000 a game.

44:12.150 --> 44:16.305
Claudia, why don't you show us
the way to the bowling alley?

44:20.408 --> 44:24.233
Isn't she the most incredible
woman you've ever seen?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.538
She's hot.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.486
And those babies are real.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.571
Twice.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.577
What's so funny?

44:41.846 --> 44:44.890
I didn't want to be the one to tell
him, but with those narrow hips,

44:44.891 --> 44:48.340
that girl couldn't have more
than six or seven children.

44:59.697 --> 45:03.567
An open frame in the tenth.
I was robbed, god damn it!

45:03.701 --> 45:07.901
He's got a 228.
You need three strikes, Ish.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.373
Okay, stay focused.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.948
Snap it. Pull.
Pull that string. All right.

45:16.797 --> 45:20.634
Hey, Munson, now it's
getting interesting, huh?

45:20.635 --> 45:24.460
Bottom of the ninth.
Two-minute warning. Last frame.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.942
There's no question farmer
boy's a fine bowler,

45:36.943 --> 45:38.890
but competing under pressure?

45:45.743 --> 45:48.111
One more, Ish. One more.

45:48.913 --> 45:52.738
Boy, it's hot in here.
I need something to cool down.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.769
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

46:12.770 --> 46:14.604
Does anyone else want one?

46:14.605 --> 46:17.482
Yeah, I'll take a
couple jugs... Mugs.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.931
Bottle. One... One bottle.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.723
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
I'll get that.

46:29.912 --> 46:33.316
- What kind do you want, Mr. Munson?
- Whatever.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.866
Here you go, sir.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.995
- Come on, buddy, bowl.
- I'm kind of nippy.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.390
Yes!

47:11.162 --> 47:12.579
What can I say?

47:12.580 --> 47:15.233
Good game. My hat's off to you.

47:17.168 --> 47:21.573
The great Stanley got beaten by
the farm boy on his own track.

47:23.799 --> 47:27.578
Could I have a word with you
in the other room, dear?

47:42.485 --> 47:44.527
Don't ever pull that shit with me!

47:44.528 --> 47:46.237
What do you mean?
I wasn't doing anything.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.515
What's wrong with you?

47:56.207 --> 47:59.531
Anyway, I owe you guys
a little bit of money.

48:01.921 --> 48:04.289
Let's play another game.

48:04.298 --> 48:06.341
Oh, no. Not tonight.

48:06.342 --> 48:10.178
We got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow,
and it's a school night, so...

48:10.179 --> 48:12.752
- What the hell is that?
- What?

48:13.808 --> 48:15.380
This.

48:15.434 --> 48:18.132
One hundred-dollar bill
wrapped in Monopoly money.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.942
You look like you want to hit me.

48:23.943 --> 48:27.017
We don't raise our hands
in anger against others.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.740
Well, we do!

48:30.741 --> 48:32.283
Unbelievable!

48:32.284 --> 48:33.910
You disgrace my home,

48:33.911 --> 48:37.247
dishonor the game by betting
with money you don't even have!

48:37.248 --> 48:39.499
You piece of garbage!

48:39.500 --> 48:41.292
I want you to take them out back,

48:41.293 --> 48:46.089
and I want you to make his left
hand look just like his right hand!

48:46.090 --> 48:47.757
- Mr. Munson...
- What the hell?

48:47.758 --> 48:49.592
- Get them! Don't let them get out!
- I got them!

48:49.593 --> 48:51.428
- Hit the lights!
- I got the punk!

48:51.429 --> 48:53.054
Where's the door?

48:53.055 --> 48:55.390
You bald bastard,
I'll gouge your eyes out!

48:55.391 --> 48:58.169
You son of a... Oh, shit!

49:04.608 --> 49:05.900
- Give me the keys.
- Why?

49:05.901 --> 49:07.527
Give me the goddamn keys.

49:07.528 --> 49:09.896
Hey, nobody drives my car.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.700
- Come on, Mr. Munson.
- Wait, wait, wait.

49:13.701 --> 49:15.899
Come on, Mr. Munson.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.446
Shit! Look at this.

49:36.849 --> 49:39.843
Hey, hey. Slow down, all right?
You're gonna get us all killed.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.270
Shit!

49:42.271 --> 49:44.048
Shit! Shit!

49:44.607 --> 49:47.066
I don't know why I did this.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.651
I don't know where I'm going.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.225
I don't have a clue what I'm
gonna do when I get there.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.607
Why couldn't this have worked out?

49:55.117 --> 49:59.238
He hit me, the bastard,
and hitting I don't take!

50:00.206 --> 50:04.125
Look, just calm down, all right?
Take it easy. Calm.

50:04.126 --> 50:06.995
Just like the kid
back there. Look how...

50:07.796 --> 50:09.243
Ish.

50:11.926 --> 50:13.452
Ish?

50:13.677 --> 50:16.171
Pull it over. Pull it over.

50:19.141 --> 50:23.269
Ishmael always was a strange boy,
but he means well, and we love him.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.771
Please bring him back home.

50:24.772 --> 50:26.272
I will, Father.

50:26.273 --> 50:29.597
I promise you, I will
not return without him.

50:37.034 --> 50:41.538
I walked past them
all just like I say

50:41.539 --> 50:46.417
And I felt this hurt
that would not go home

50:46.418 --> 50:50.296
I can't expect you all
to see this my way

50:50.297 --> 50:55.843
But you might not remember
the trees that I'd known

50:55.844 --> 51:01.171
And I want them to bring
back my old corner store

51:04.061 --> 51:06.008
Damn this hand!

51:06.230 --> 51:07.981
Where do you get something like that?

51:07.982 --> 51:11.977
Prosthetics-R-Us, aisle 6.
Right next to the glass eyeballs.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.813
Must be tough when you're
spanking your monkey.

51:15.614 --> 51:17.687
You have a monkey?

51:19.034 --> 51:21.436
Hey, handsome, how about a dance?

51:22.413 --> 51:25.915
Yeah, well, thank you, young lovely,

51:25.916 --> 51:28.084
but to tell you the truth
I'm a little bit worn out.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.877
I wasn't asking you.

51:29.878 --> 51:32.422
She said handsome, not handless.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.132
So, how about it?

51:34.133 --> 51:36.593
Dance? I don't know how to dance.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.497
Well, it's about time you learned.

51:50.024 --> 51:54.569
When there's things to do
and not because you gotta

51:54.570 --> 51:59.191
When you run for love
not because you ought to

51:59.950 --> 52:01.743
Listen.

52:01.744 --> 52:04.996
We appreciate your help with
your boyfriend and everything.

52:04.997 --> 52:08.196
- But...
- You look. I did it for the kid.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.293
A cheap hustler like you,

52:10.294 --> 52:13.288
I couldn't have cared if they
put a bullet in your head.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.215
You care about the kid, huh?

52:16.216 --> 52:18.718
Well, I got a newsflash
for you, Mother Teresa.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.471
Just because you spend most of
your time in the missionary position

52:21.472 --> 52:24.125
doesn't make you a missionary.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.477
- This is gonna work out fine.
- What?

52:27.478 --> 52:29.187
Well, it's better that we
don't like each other,

52:29.188 --> 52:30.897
since we're gonna be
business partners.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.925
You know, checks and balances.

52:34.943 --> 52:36.486
- Business partners?
- Yeah.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.112
That's precious.

52:38.113 --> 52:41.324
Look, I saw your phony roll.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.602
You don't have enough
money to get to Reno.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.830
Why don't you just
eat your chili fries

52:47.831 --> 52:49.791
and drink your shake
and go blow lunch,

52:49.792 --> 52:52.669
or do whatever it is you do to keep
that ass of yours in business?

52:52.670 --> 52:54.087
Look, Mr. Munster,

52:54.088 --> 52:57.173
you're not exactly the smartest
guy I ever ran across.

52:57.174 --> 53:00.077
Oh, yeah? And who are you,
Alfred Einstein?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.082
So, this is rock 'n' roll.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.634
I like it.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.715
God.

53:10.062 --> 53:13.022
- It's my boyfriend, Skidmark.
- I'd like to meet him.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.191
I don't think you want to meet him.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.567
Hi, Mr. Skidmark.

53:16.568 --> 53:20.196
Look, your act is about as
fresh as a Foghat concert.

53:20.197 --> 53:22.315
It really bites, Roy.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.908
You don't have to worry about us.

53:23.909 --> 53:25.618
I know a little something
about this racket.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.286
I learned it the hard way.

53:27.287 --> 53:31.457
Yeah, well, I've got
stake money. 500 bucks.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.376
And I'll tell you something else.

53:33.377 --> 53:35.628
Ishmael likes me.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.714
I promise you, you're not his type.

53:37.715 --> 53:41.426
I'm his type. I'm every guy's type.

53:41.427 --> 53:42.927
You trying to pick up my woman?

53:42.928 --> 53:44.345
Hey, you crazy or something?

53:44.346 --> 53:46.293
Hey! Come here!

53:46.557 --> 53:48.391
- Get him, Skid.
- She was just teaching me to dance.

53:48.392 --> 53:51.477
I didn't know how to dance, and...
You want to dance?

53:51.478 --> 53:53.438
What are you trying to say?
You want me to dance?

53:53.439 --> 53:55.690
Well, no. No, not if you don't
want to. I mean, I just...

53:55.691 --> 53:58.151
I can't believe you're in here
trying to move in on my squirrel.

53:58.152 --> 54:00.153
I ought to stoot slap
your ass right now!

54:00.154 --> 54:02.405
We're gonna drill you
another asshole, shithead!

54:02.406 --> 54:05.434
You want to kiss somebody,
Goldilocks? Kiss these!

54:13.041 --> 54:15.168
Take that, you freaky piece of shit!

54:15.169 --> 54:19.164
- You don't mow another guy's lawn!
- All right! All right!

54:20.841 --> 54:23.539
That was really heroic, Munson.

54:24.136 --> 54:25.970
Hey, I did Ish a favor.

54:25.971 --> 54:29.766
If I hadn't knocked him out,
those animals would've torn him apart.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.142
That's the thanks I get?

54:31.143 --> 54:34.843
You didn't have to have
beers with them afterwards.

54:35.022 --> 54:38.346
Well, I didn't want them to
think that we were in cahoots.

54:38.859 --> 54:42.308
Well, I think you cleared that up
when you rubbed Tabasco in his eyes.

54:44.323 --> 54:48.398
Could you move that seat up
so I can stretch my feet out?

54:50.454 --> 54:52.497
Thanks, Miss Claudia.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.664
Here.

54:53.665 --> 54:57.543
I had them wrap up your food 'cause
this'll probably be your last meal.

54:57.544 --> 55:00.213
Seeing as you don't
have any more money.

55:00.214 --> 55:03.037
You're the greatest, Miss Claudia.

55:08.514 --> 55:11.417
Ishmael, I just had a thought. I...

55:12.017 --> 55:16.797
Seeing as how Claudia
has been so kind to us,

55:17.606 --> 55:22.227
I thought maybe she could join us
till she gets back on her feet.

55:23.070 --> 55:24.642
Yeah?

55:24.655 --> 55:29.231
Mr. Munson, if I could
see you, I'd kiss you.

55:30.494 --> 55:35.400
Isn't he the best? I mean,
you're the best, Mr. Munson.

58:01.979 --> 58:05.349
- What you doing there, Mr. Munson?
- Flossing.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.180
Flossing?

58:09.152 --> 58:11.304
Where did I get "munson" from?

58:12.990 --> 58:15.574
The name's Munson.
What I'm doing is flossing.

58:15.575 --> 58:17.368
This is called floss.
It cleans your teeth.

58:17.369 --> 58:20.413
You ought to try it sometime.
You'd be amazed what you'd find.

58:20.414 --> 58:24.068
I guess I don't know much
about life outside of Brimfield.

58:25.002 --> 58:28.004
I was never in a car before.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.840
I never stayed in a
fancy hotel before.

58:30.841 --> 58:34.586
Never saw a man pick his
nose with a hook before.

58:35.095 --> 58:39.921
When I stop and think about
it all, it can get pretty scary.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.566
Mr. Munson!

58:48.567 --> 58:50.985
It's an emergency. We got
to get the hell out of here.

58:50.986 --> 58:52.987
- But what are we gonna...
- No if, ands or buts.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.072
- You just get moving.
- I'll go get Miss Claudia.

58:55.073 --> 58:58.701
No. Don't get Claudia.
I'll explain it all later.

58:58.702 --> 59:01.730
- Just be quiet.
- Okay.

59:04.249 --> 59:06.459
I think I tore my sack.

59:06.460 --> 59:10.364
- Are you okay, Mr. Munson?
- What did I just say?

59:10.839 --> 59:14.508
- "I think I tore my sack"?
- No! "Be quiet!"

59:14.509 --> 59:16.001
Okay.

59:19.723 --> 59:22.641
- The Army evacuated everybody.
- Evacuated?

59:22.642 --> 59:25.061
Yeah. A big military train derailed,

59:25.062 --> 59:27.646
and this whole area is in
danger of being contaminated

59:27.647 --> 59:30.066
by a huge cloud of... Shit!

59:30.067 --> 59:33.346
A huge cloud of shit? Wow!

59:33.528 --> 59:35.863
God! I think I smell it!
Come on, let's go!

59:35.864 --> 59:38.687
Come on, Mr. Munson. Miss Claudia.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.647
Roy, could we go have a little chat?

59:44.664 --> 59:47.317
- Surely.
- Great.

59:52.464 --> 59:54.882
Hey, everybody,
there's a shit cloud coming!

59:54.883 --> 59:56.956
Run for your lives!

59:56.968 --> 59:59.720
$60-a-night motel room,
and you're sleeping in the car?

59:59.721 --> 01:00:00.930
That makes a lot of sense.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.598
Yeah. Don't I feel like a fool?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.799
I know what you're thinking, all right?
So just let me explain here.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.731
Mommy.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:14.276
You must have a really wide foot.
You got both of them.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.738
I can't believe you were gonna ditch
out and go to Reno without me!

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.281
I thought we were partners!

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.952
Hey! Spare me the
indignant routine, all right?

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:25.121
You've been rubbing your
tits in that kid's face

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:28.415
from the moment we hooked up,
so that you could steal him from me.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.793
- What?
- Don't give me that "what" crap.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.504
Half the dresses you got,
you need two hairdos to wear.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:37.133
Admit it! You've been planning on
taking him from me and leaving me flat.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.717
I just beat you to the punch.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.679
How dare you accuse me of anything?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.306
Ish worships you, and all you've
done is feed him a load of bullshit

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.808
so you can line your own pockets!

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:49.353
Come on. Right now. You and me, bud.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:52.773
What? Hey, look. Listen, lady,

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.484
I've done a lot of creepy
things in my life,

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.059
but I'm not gonna lower myself
into having a fistfight with a girl.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.309
Stop that!

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.432
Ishmael! Where is he?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.441
- Ishmael!
- Great.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:55.116
"I thought you were my friends.
Good-bye, Ishmael."

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.648
I hope Ishmael has
enough street smarts

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.900
to get to Reno by himself.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.610
Poor guy.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:22.139
He's like a baby out there.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:28.228
I hope he doesn't get munsoned
out in the middle of nowhere.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.874
Oh, shit!

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:39.076
You know, I didn't realize it,
but we're near where I grew up.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:43.038
What time are the tours
to your boyhood home?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.088
Yeah.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:00.886
You know, it's been 17 years since
I showed my face around here.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.481
How do I look?

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.713
You look good, Roy.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.457
Real sharp.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.790
All right.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.837
You okay?

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:24.931
It's just not what I expected.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:30.024
What's taken you so
long to come back, Roy?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.659
Guess I was ashamed, you know.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.609
Everybody expected so much from me.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.699
Everyone believed in me.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.449
At least my dad did.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.741
He gave me this when I left.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.954
I never could get the
damn thing running.

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:57.844
It's funny. It's like time stopped
for me when I left this town.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.723
Yeah, he taught me a lot out here.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:14.018
Got word he died about 10 years ago.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.656
Didn't even have the nerve
to come back for the funeral.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.467
Well, your old man would be proud.

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:34.338
I mean, here you are, passing all
that bowling knowledge on to Ishmael.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.964
No, he wouldn't be proud.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.349
Let's go find that kid.

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:09.047
You know, Ishmael, I sure hope you
make enough money out in Reno

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.716
to save that town of yours.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.790
Thanks, Miss Tabitha.

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.549
Time to settle up.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.470
Is that eight hours already?

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:25.635
This shift just flew by.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.027
This lap dance is so much fun.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:33.477
I feel like I should be
the one paying you.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.410
- Gee, mister. I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.704
No! Please, sir, please.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.206
I can work it off.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.208
I'm pretty good with
a needle and thread.

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:47.753
I can knit. I can sew the girls'
costumes when they get frayed.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:52.007
No, sir! Please!
I'll do anything, anything, please.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.660
Anything?

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.254
Come here.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.559
What do you think
about new beginnings?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.979
What is that,
the feminine hygiene spray?

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.678
You and me, starting over.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.520
Yeah.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.520
I'd like that.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.162
- Longish hair.
- Weird guy.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.081
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Down that way.

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:25.734
Uncle Willee's Snake Farm.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.585
Yeah, he was here.

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:30.879
I offered him a job, a good job.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.032
You think that guy took it?

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.639
He didn't take it.
The wimp is afraid of snakes.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.634
You son of a bitch.
You're going in my stew.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.592
Thank you.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.767
Take it off, girl!

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:11.086
Hi. You seen a big Amish
guy come through here?

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:13.005
Fortyish, stocky.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.909
- Sort of friendly.
- Kind of stupid?

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.127
Well, naive.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.794
Feast your eyes.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.912
Get in! Come on! Get a move on!

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.122
Hey! Nobody quits in
the middle of a show!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.992
Sons of bitches!

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.921
Ish, I don't understand how
you can still be mad at us.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.715
We just saved your butt.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:09:01.094
I heard what you were saying
about me, about each other.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:04.840
I thought we were partners,
but I guess I was wrong.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.961
Ish, it's tough out there, all right?

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.564
I mean, the world can kick your ass.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:16.935
I only have a vague recollection
of when it wasn't kicking mine.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.029
I guess that's why Claudia
and I were fighting.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:24.785
We both had a rotten run of it for
a while, and I don't know, you...

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:26.912
You get hurt over and over again,

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.692
you stop trusting people so
you don't get hurt again.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:36.254
Look, Ish, if you really
want to call an end to this,

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.578
we'll drop you off wherever you want.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:41.051
But if you want to go on,

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.301
from here on out,

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.638
we're all gonna work
together as a team.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.712
And no more bullshitting.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.051
I promise.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.299
Ish, you remember what it says in
the Bible about not forgiving, right?

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:57.389
I know exactly what it says.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.071
It's against it.

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:02.439
Right?

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:56.053
"Jeffersons on Ice!" Look at that!
I love Sherman Hemsley!

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.201
- What's this?
- What?

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:26.007
- What is that?
- It's a tattoo. Relax.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.342
Tattoo!

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.428
How could you let me do this, Roy?
How could you?

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:35.255
I don't know. I don't remember a thing.
The whole night's a blur to me, all right?

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.431
I've committed a sin.

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.985
I've desecrated my body.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:48.154
Can't go home now. No, can't go home!

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:52.276
It'll come right off.
They'll just burn it off in a jiffy.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:59.115
Hey, this isn't so bad.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.864
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.933
You are gonna give me
$100,000 on the line

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:20.687
and a $50,000-yell, okay?

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:24.816
Hey, top heavy. Bring me a Tiparillo
and a sake and seltzer, s'il vous plaît.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.469
Okay, here we go.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.726
Come on, do it to me!

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:33.033
- Yeah. Right.
- Overshot...

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.911
Overshot. All right.
No, it is. It's okay.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:41.113
It's okay because I am
going to bet $800,000

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.362
on the line. Okay?

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.422
Here we go.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:50.592
Hey, doll face. How about bringing
me a little lady luck, huh?

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:53.667
- Sure thing.
- No, not you.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.791
It's a winner!

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.644
Go, Ish.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.062
Well, that's something.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.885
All right!

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.489
Yeah.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.907
Okay, here we go.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.855
Two number 64s

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.855
and a 41.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:23.166
You know, their 64 is supposed
to be the best in the city.

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.961
Yeah? That 41 doesn't look bad.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.171
You can go to the potato bar
whenever you're ready.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.632
So, which opponent poses the biggest
threat to you in the tournament?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:33.343
Me. If I get drunk, and fall down
and hurt myself, I might lose.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:34.678
Sure, babe.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.763
- What's your name?
- Darlene.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:38.098
I'm in 1103.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:41.643
Excuse me. What's the story behind
this pending paternity suit against you?

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.229
That's not a case at all.
The woman's a stone-faced liar.

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:45.480
Let's not even talk about that.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.066
I pulled out of her
really early on that one.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.276
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:51.769
Hey!

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.765
The Munson!

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:56.767
Big Ern.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.827
Long time.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:02.872
I'll say. Probably a year for
every topping on the table.

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:05.275
I heard a horrible rumor.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:09.246
Creepy!

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.339
I'm sorry.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:15.135
You know, for the first couple years,

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:17.538
I felt responsible.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.999
How you been otherwise?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.145
You know, in the last 17 years,
a day hasn't gone by

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:29.176
that I haven't thought about what I'd
say to you if I ever ran into you again.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:32.265
I bet. Hello.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.981
Oh, my God. Claudia?

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.034
You two know each other?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:42.735
It's a small world when you've
got unbelievable tits, Roy.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.665
Baby, we had some
good times in Chicago.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:48.819
I remember. I know
you haven't forgotten.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.713
- Him and you?
- Why didn't you quit slumming?

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.881
The two of you together?

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.050
Come back to me.
Let's try to make it work.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:58.455
Let's try, really try. How about it?

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.965
I'd rather mop the
floors at a peepshow.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:05.101
Girl, you still got your great stuff.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:08.396
Why don't you get the hell out
of here? You ruined my life!

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:13.151
Are you still holding on to all the anger?
I said I was sorry. I meant it.

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:14.444
Hey.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:18.073
I remember that night, too, and I don't
remember anybody twisting your arm.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:21.242
Oh, God! I just said "twisting
your arm" to Munson!

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.661
I can't wait to tell people. Hey!

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:27.082
Don't do it, Mr. Munson. He's just
trying to lower you to his level.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.875
Let me give you some advice.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:32.655
Stay away from this guy, huh?
Give him a wide berth.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:38.837
He's what is called a born
loser, a real Munson.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.292
- You...
- Hey!

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:45.050
- Hey!
- You just shut up, mister!

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.185
I don't know who the
heck you think you are,

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.521
but if you don't wiggle
those childbearing hips

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.064
out that door in five seconds,

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:54.309
you're gonna find your nose
sniffing my big Amish ass!

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.558
Claudia, I'm in 1103.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.190
Thanks, Ish. You okay?

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.239
Ish?

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:14.120
Listen, I'm gonna go after
him and talk to him.

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.048
Boo.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.131
Stan!

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.409
You shouldn't have quit me, baby.

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.484
Yeah? Well,
you shouldn't have hit me.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.857
You think that hurt?

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:53.869
You wait and see what I
do to your two friends.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.340
Look, we both made mistakes.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.585
I've got 42 grand right there.
We can just take off right now.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.668
I mean, those guys are
bugging me anyway.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.392
I want to see those
guys one more time.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:12.812
They're not worth it.
They're a couple of losers.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:16.217
Now, come on. We can
just take off right now.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:20.015
I missed you.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:28.024
L$h, you okay?

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:36.696
You're not taking a crap
in the sink, are you?

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:47.256
It's over, Mr. Munson. It's broken.

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:49.599
No.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.185
I think it's just sprained.

01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:55.305
Okay, it's broke. It's broke.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:03.488
Excuse me. Where's the
lady who's staying here?

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:07.367
- She checked out already.
- She left with a couple of guys.

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:10.745
Couple of guys? No. You mean
you saw her with us, right?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.569
No, these guys were good-looking.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.505
- You got the bag, right?
- Bag?

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:23.424
The bag. The bag.
Tell me you got the bag.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:24.676
- Oh, yeah.
- You got the bag?

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:28.221
Yeah. Okay, relax. The bag, yeah.
The bag's fine.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:31.045
I gave it to Miss Claudia to hold.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.972
Who you calling a psycho?

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.985
I didn't say anything to you.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.033
Are you okay, Mr. Munson?

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.465
Hi. How are you?

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.467
Remember me?

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.553
Yeah, from the crap table.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:11.681
That's right, from the crap table.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:15.552
And you're the big guy with
the lucky dice, aren't you?

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.088
Jeez.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.149
Boy, the two of you
kind of look a little...

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:24.319
- Well, a little down on your luck, huh?
- If you only knew.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.571
Jeez, that's tough.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.323
Look at George and Weezy go.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.022
What did that fat-ass Lionel
do with my lottery ticket?

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:37.108
Well, look, I've got a
little proposition for you.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.985
I'm all ears.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:45.089
I will pay you $1 million to
sleep with your friend here.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:48.460
$1 million. One night. Cash.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.096
Just throw that out.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:56.047
You two mull it over,
get back to me. I'll be back here.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.980
What's there to mull over?

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:05.227
I mean, are you gonna set that
creep straight or should I?

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.513
I'll handle this.

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.348
Yeah?

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:26.369
I said, are you all right,
Mr. Munson?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.436
I wish I'd have never trusted her.
What was I thinking?

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.010
42 grand down the drain.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.651
She'll be back.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.736
You're never gonna see
her again, all right?

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.739
Well, I happen to think
you're wrong, Mr. Munson.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.408
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.577
The money we came here to
win is right here in Reno,

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.496
at a legitimate sporting contest

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.498
where the best player wins
because he's the best player,

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:03.543
and we have the best player.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.961
Okay, I'm listening.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:07.338
We are going to do
what we set out to do.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.756
We're gonna win that tournament.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.425
Yes! I knew it.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:14.956
I knew you were a champion the
minute I saw you bowl, Ish.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.432
I'm not gonna bowl.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.880
You are.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:23.604
You are such a loser.
You're a bona fide schmuck.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.382
Look at me.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:29.569
Mr. Munson, I know you
can win that tournament.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:32.196
You're a champion,
and that never goes away.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.657
I'm sure that if you made it
through the first few rounds,

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.856
you'd find your touch again.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.412
I'm Ernie McCracken.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.790
When I found out little Billy here
was growing up without a daddy,

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.000
I had to do something.

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.835
When Big Ern saw our
picture in the paper,

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:48.212
he called the Unified
Fund and got involved.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:49.672
I had to.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.507
I couldn't help myself.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:53.676
But little Billy's not the only one.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.928
There's also little Jason here.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:59.182
Once again this year, I'll be
sponsoring a fatherless family

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:02.006
in every city I bowl in.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.769
Sometimes when I wake
up in the morning,

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:06.423
Mr. McCracken's already there.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:10.598
Jonathan, run a fly pattern
all the way to the goal line.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.197
Tennessee.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:16.191
Kentucky.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.773
Fonda Beach!

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.447
Deeper, Jonathan.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.208
It's a tough world.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:29.489
These kids nearly got munsoned,
but they're back now.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:35.510
Through the Unified Fund,
I found out that if you give a little,

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:39.791
you can get back a whole lot more.

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:04.318
Hey! Give me that.
What are you doing?

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.995
Well, it's a young crowd.
I don't recognize a single soul.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.706
Ishmael, welcome to my church.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.259
Wow.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:21.257
It's kind of intimidating to be in the
presence of so many great athletes.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.836
Hi. What's your name?

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:28.589
Munson, Roy E.

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:34.352
- Seriously.
- Munson, Roy E.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.348
Amateur or professional?

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.608
Professional.

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:46.565
We have a problem here.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:52.659
Your dues are in arrears.
You haven't paid them since 1979.

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:58.209
How much is that gonna cost me?

01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:01.804
Dues times 16 years,

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:06.381
plus penalties, plus interest equals

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.591
$38.

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:15.067
- Well, let's go. That's it.
- No, hold on.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:19.723
Would you be willing to hold on
to this till after the tournament?

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.855
Come on. What are we gonna
do with a rubber hand?

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:24.940
The ring.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:31.905
Okay.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:34.837
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:36.672
The National Bowling Stadium

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:39.675
in conjunction with the Silver
Legacy Hotel and Casino

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:43.971
would like to welcome everyone
to the $1 million, winner-take-all

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:47.216
Brunswick-Reno Open!

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:51.020
Please enjoy your stay here at our
fabulous facility, and remember,

01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:53.522
the Silver Legacy is still
the talk of the Strip

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:56.359
with our 22-topping potato bar.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.058
Let's start the tournament.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.613
I can't.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.463
That's the way, Mr. Munson!

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:32.879
All right! Yeah!

01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:36.524
You wouldn't happen to have a
Phillips-head screwdriver, would you?

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.017
No.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.731
Never mind.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.183
All right, Mr. Munson.

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.758
You know, Ish, I'm starting
to feel like a winner again.

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:29.789
Okay, you scumbags. Now turn
around and face the wall.

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.617
We have a Cinderella
story shaping up here.

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:18.454
Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa
state amateur champion,

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:21.373
has suddenly come out of
nowhere with his bowling ball.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:24.277
He is a major contender
in this competition.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:25.419
So, Roy, let me ask you.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.539
What have you been
doing all these years?

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:33.374
Well, the... After the hand, I...

01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:36.847
There... No, there was... The '80s...

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:39.501
You know, for a while, I...

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.176
Drinking.

01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:47.475
Yeah. A lot of drinking.

01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:52.196
Are you still drinking?

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:56.075
No, no, no. I don't...
That's behind me now. I just...

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:58.604
Why, are you buying?

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:46.083
...as the early favorite for
Coach of the Year honors.

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:49.837
And now, we're going live to
the National Bowling Stadium

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:53.048
in the biggest little city
in the world, Reno, Nevada,

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.801
where ESPN is set to bring
you final-round coverage

01:31:55.802 --> 01:32:00.014
of the $1 million, winner-take-all
Silver Legacy Reno Open.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:04.184
What an incredible championship match
we have in store for you today.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:07.813
Ernie McCracken, a crafty veteran,
and, you know, a heck of a nice guy,

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:12.890
goes against Roy Munson, a promising
young talent in the 1970s.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:20.526
- What you doing in there, Mr. Munson?
- Barfing.

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:23.028
Barfing?

01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:26.957
Where do I keep
getting "munson" from?

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:30.032
Please rise for the national anthem.

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:37.536
Oh, say can you see

01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:42.924
By the dawn's early light

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:48.383
Have you been drinking again?

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:51.428
I don't puke when I drink.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:54.056
I puke when I don't.

01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.147
I'm scared, Ish.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:05.864
Let's get ready to bowl!

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:08.040
And here they come,
our two finalists.

01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:11.460
Roy Munson has one of the most
intimidating hooks in all of bowling,

01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:13.796
quite literally, Chris. In fact,
the fans here in Reno

01:33:13.797 --> 01:33:15.547
have started calling him
"The Rubber Man,"

01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:17.841
because he bowls with a
rubber prosthetic hand.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:19.802
And take a look at that
focus on Roy's face.

01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:21.750
He is ready for this match.

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:24.348
A nasty spill.

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:27.518
That's kind of embarrassing,
in front of an audience like this.

01:33:27.519 --> 01:33:29.061
Look at Ernie McCracken.

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:31.313
A guy like Big Ern,
with his panache and style,

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:35.275
has clearly done for bowling what
Muhammad Ali did for boxing.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:38.529
Wow. Take a look at that.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.698
Have you, in 34 years of
covering bowling, Chris,

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.158
ever seen a ball like that?

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:47.280
- What is that, a rose?
- It appears to be. Clearly custom-made.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:51.083
Ernie's got a heart of gold,
but what an intimidator.

01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:52.668
Go, Big Ern!

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:55.921
You know, he goes to his spot.
On the approach.

01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:57.798
Ernie McCracken.

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:00.748
How about one more title, sweetness?

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.804
Look at that form.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:06.833
That left arm way out
is an unusual style.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:12.938
- Wow. Right off the bat.
- Beautiful. What a hit!

01:34:12.939 --> 01:34:17.185
He delivers on the goods.
Look at him pump up this crowd.

01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:20.571
Roy looks a little nervous,
a little unsettled.

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:23.448
It is his first final
in nearly 20 years.

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:25.951
The Rubber Man takes the ball
from his good left hand,

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:28.871
and then notice how carefully he
places it in the prosthetic hand.

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.080
You have no idea the pressure this...

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.624
- Time out! Time out!
- Look at that.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.868
Give me that handsome cheek.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:39.590
- Wait, let me get Ernie, too.
- Give us a break.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:43.093
Look. Look at Big Ern, Chris.
Look at Big Ern.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:45.292
Calls her back.

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.557
How gallant is that?

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:52.728
This man's gonna win a lot of political
offices when his career's over.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:55.757
A great role model
for America's kids.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:01.767
Attaboy, Luther!

01:35:06.826 --> 01:35:09.119
Yes, a solid pocket hit.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.195
Munson answers right
back in Big Ern's face.

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:48.885
Hey, sport, Coca-Cola.

01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:50.629
You betcha.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:55.967
I got to make a phone call.

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:04.359
Could you put on ESPN, please?

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.886
Sure thing.

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:14.479
Come on, Roy.

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:20.417
Yes.

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:21.819
Nice action.

01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:32.220
This $1 million, winner-take-all
championship match

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:34.264
has reached the tenth frame.

01:37:34.265 --> 01:37:38.268
Leading by nine pins, Roy Munson,
shooting first on the right lane.

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:41.513
A strike here provides
some breathing room.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:53.450
The dreaded 7-10 split.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:55.786
You know, Roy Munson has two chances

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:57.037
to win this tournament now,

01:37:57.038 --> 01:37:59.498
slim and none, and slim
may have just left town.

01:37:59.499 --> 01:38:00.874
How true.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:04.795
You know, in bowling,
there are 1,022 spare leaves,

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:08.131
and this, the 7-10,
is by far the most difficult.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.300
Virtually impossible to convert.

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:14.054
There's no way you could slide the
10 pin into the 7 or vice versa.

01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:15.456
You're the man, Roy!

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:19.252
Please. I can't look. I can't look.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:30.896
Thomas, what are you doing here?

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:35.283
- Ishmael, it's time to go home.
- I can't go home now.

01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:36.952
This is the tenth frame,
and if he makes this,

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:39.663
he's gonna win $1 million,
and we can save the farm,

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:42.791
and I have a half a beer left,
and there's no way I'm going home.

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:44.535
Over my dead body.

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:47.254
It's time to go home now.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:48.907
Okay.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.925
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:54.469
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.972
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

01:38:56.973 --> 01:38:59.501
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:08.358
Yeah!

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:12.070
Oh, my God! He has done it!
He has done it!

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:15.240
Now, if Roy can pick
up one final strike,

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:18.201
he'll force Big Ern to roll
three consecutive strikes

01:39:18.202 --> 01:39:20.730
in order to win this match.

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:26.042
With that spare, he's not
slammed the door on Big Ern,

01:39:26.043 --> 01:39:29.242
but he's put on quite
a lot of pressure.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:38.918
Where'd he go?

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:45.562
Yes.

01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:47.230
The Rubber Man has gotten it done,

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:50.650
and now the pressure is
squarely on Big Ern McCracken.

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.736
Trailing by 29 pins,

01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:56.687
he needs three consecutive
strikes to win it all.

01:39:57.617 --> 01:40:00.243
I need you now.
More than ever, I need you.

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:02.521
Ernie, you're the man!

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.183
One strike down. Two to go.

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:25.552
You can cut this pressure
with a knife, Chris.

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:40.685
That's two. There's two. His second.

01:40:51.504 --> 01:40:56.205
Roy Munson now is
forced to sit and watch.

01:41:03.849 --> 01:41:05.725
It has come down to this.

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:07.435
One ball.

01:41:07.436 --> 01:41:09.187
One strike.

01:41:09.188 --> 01:41:11.273
$1 million.

01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:13.802
And the loser gets nothing.

01:41:56.193 --> 01:41:57.986
I'm the greatest.

01:41:57.987 --> 01:42:00.014
I'm the greatest.

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:03.158
I'm Big Ern. I'm the greatest.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.994
A one-pin victory for
Ernie McCracken.

01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:07.120
I'm Big Ern!

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:11.321
Put it in the record
books, 226 to 225.

01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:31.920
Some lucky fan has a souvenir.

01:42:35.775 --> 01:42:38.473
Big Ern, $1 million.

01:42:39.195 --> 01:42:41.404
What are you gonna do with it?

01:42:41.405 --> 01:42:42.572
I don't know.

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:45.825
All I know is I finally
got enough money.

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:48.703
I can buy my way out of anything.

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:52.123
I can do anything I want.
Now I can get myself a lawyer.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:54.250
And I'll walk!

01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:57.921
Finally, Big Ern is above the law!

01:42:57.922 --> 01:42:59.255
It's a great feeling.

01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:01.174
You were so cool. Any pressure?

01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:03.760
Where are those girls?
Get those girls over here.

01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:05.178
Yeah, there was pressure.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:08.390
I didn't want to get beat by
a guy with a hook, you know.

01:43:08.391 --> 01:43:10.600
Does this mean you're
against the handicapped?

01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:14.255
I don't know. I'm rich.
What do I care? Come on!

01:43:30.705 --> 01:43:33.073
Tough luck, Mr. Munson.

01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:08.032
- Hey, hey.
- Hey! You bastard, I'll...

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:09.617
Where the hell is she?

01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:11.661
How the hell should I know?
I thought she was with you.

01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:14.781
- She stole my money!
- Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.419
I checked my phone
records at the hotel.

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.921
She called that bastard
Ernie McCracken 14 times

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:23.339
in the last three days.

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:26.243
Now what the hell is your
relationship to him?

01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:32.417
All right, stop it! Stop it!

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:39.189
I'll tell you what my
relationship is to him.

01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:41.024
He's the guy who gave me that.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:44.778
- Nice. Is that solid gold?
- The hand.

01:44:44.779 --> 01:44:48.103
- Big Ern is responsible for that?
- Yeah.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:50.685
No, I...

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:53.286
I don't know.

01:44:53.287 --> 01:44:55.735
I used to think he was.

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.875
Now it's like you and Claudia.

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:02.530
You probably blame McCracken
for screwing that up,

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:07.034
but I'll bet it's
your own damn fault.

01:45:12.181 --> 01:45:14.549
Let's go find McCracken.

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:19.687
Hey! What are you looking at?

01:45:19.688 --> 01:45:22.386
Hey! You suck!

01:45:28.489 --> 01:45:31.938
Go away! You'll get your
rent money tomorrow!

01:45:38.874 --> 01:45:40.491
Hey, Roy.

01:45:43.254 --> 01:45:44.746
Claudia.

01:45:46.549 --> 01:45:48.747
I got the money, Roy.

01:46:07.278 --> 01:46:09.529
You left us flat, Claudia.

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.782
You dumped us when we
needed you the most.

01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.200
You tricked us.

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:15.693
I...

01:46:16.829 --> 01:46:18.955
Look, if I'd stuck with you,
Stanley would've hurt you,

01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:21.529
and he would've hurt Ishmael.

01:46:22.418 --> 01:46:24.491
What happened to McCracken?

01:46:25.004 --> 01:46:27.281
I never went with him.

01:46:28.173 --> 01:46:32.302
I just made those phone calls
to throw Stanley off my scent.

01:46:32.303 --> 01:46:35.502
And maybe give Big
Ern a little payback.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:40.294
84 grand.

01:46:40.769 --> 01:46:42.887
We can split it three ways.

01:46:43.522 --> 01:46:45.469
We only had half that.

01:46:46.317 --> 01:46:48.185
Yeah. Well,

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:51.263
we doubled it.

01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:54.270
Stanley.

01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:57.269
He bet against you.

01:47:02.207 --> 01:47:05.201
But I'm ready to start
betting on you, Roy.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:20.630
Yeah, well, too late.

01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:23.853
What?

01:47:23.854 --> 01:47:25.676
Half a mil?

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:30.932
Trojan condoms.
You know, "Rubber Man."

01:47:31.612 --> 01:47:35.198
All I have to do is a commercial,
show up at a couple of trade shows

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:39.979
and pharmacies, and give a little
talk at Vassar College orientation.

01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:44.445
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:50.076
It is great. And this is only
getting divided one way.

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:04.090
I can't face them.

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:08.064
I wanted to be the hero for once.

01:48:08.065 --> 01:48:11.184
I wanted to be the
one to save the day.

01:48:15.072 --> 01:48:16.724
Brother,

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:20.732
everyone knows you meant well.

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.351
Mr. Munson!

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:47.220
Miss Claudia!

01:48:47.563 --> 01:48:50.091
What are you two doing here?

01:48:52.484 --> 01:48:55.111
I'll tell you what
they're doing here.

01:48:55.112 --> 01:48:58.686
They came to tell us the
truth about your trip.

01:49:02.411 --> 01:49:05.985
They tell you everything?

01:49:06.957 --> 01:49:09.485
Yes, Roy told us everything.

01:49:11.295 --> 01:49:13.588
He told us about the booze,

01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:15.715
and the lusting,

01:49:15.716 --> 01:49:17.789
the late nights,

01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:20.332
the lying.

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:23.123
And the gambling.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.711
And he told us how you
got him to quit all that.

01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:33.649
How you got Roy to
straighten his life out.

01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:39.272
And how you got Claudia to quit being
so much of the whore that she is.

01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:45.578
And Roy also told us how every time
he wanted to quit, you wouldn't let him.

01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:48.732
How you quoted the scriptures
to give him strength.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:52.448
Yes, Son, he's told us everything.

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:57.953
And we're mighty proud of you.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.391
But what about the bank
and the foreclosure?

01:50:07.392 --> 01:50:12.355
That's all been taken care of by
Brother Roy and Sister Claudia.

01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:15.885
They put $500,000 in the bank.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.361
Our troubles are over!

01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:20.605
Our troubles are over!

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.563
You guys!

01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.704
I'm gonna have to watch you two.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:32.530
Miss Claudia, I knew you'd come back.

01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:40.625
Thanks, Mr. Munson.
Thanks for everything.

01:50:43.095 --> 01:50:47.295
Hey, Ish, you know that
old centurion's faith thing,

01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:50.965
about you saving the Amish people?

01:50:54.982 --> 01:50:56.383
Well...

01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.694
It wasn't...

01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:04.692
That was baloney. It wasn't them
you were saving. It was me.

01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:13.658
You lost me. What?

01:51:20.757 --> 01:51:23.551
Come on, Ishmael.
Everyone's waiting at the party.

01:51:23.552 --> 01:51:26.596
They want to hear all about the missionary
work you did with Brother Munson.

01:51:26.597 --> 01:51:28.514
Okay, Miss Rebecca.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:31.338
- Bye, Miss Claudia.
- Bye, Ishmael.

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:35.971
Bye, Ish.

01:51:39.067 --> 01:51:40.844
Hey, Roy.

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:44.272
I have something for you.

01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:48.272
Wow.

01:51:51.455 --> 01:51:52.622
You got it working.

01:51:52.623 --> 01:51:54.866
Yeah. I wound it.

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:57.656
There's a winder.

01:51:59.838 --> 01:52:04.084
- Well, look at that, a little ladybug.
- You should make a wish.

01:52:05.219 --> 01:52:07.041
All right.

01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:13.589
You know what I wished for?

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.046
What?

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:34.648
Bye, Brother Munson. Bye, whore.

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.362
Action!

01:57:02.599 --> 01:57:04.251
Cut!
