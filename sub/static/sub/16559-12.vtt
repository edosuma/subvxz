00:02.460 --> 00:03.460
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.460 --> 00:04.500
Frank turned himself in
last night.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.210
You ruined his life.
You did this.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.460
Just think about the pain
that he felt.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.880
You want to know pain?!
I'll show you pain!

00:09.880 --> 00:10.620
No deal.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.580
You can fix this.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.790
I remember something else.
I saw Frank...

00:15.790 --> 00:16.960
in the basement.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.420
He ran out
of the storm door.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.620
Frank Delfino,
you are being charged

00:20.620 --> 00:23.000
with the first-degree murder
of Wesley Gibbins.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.330
They charged Frank.

00:24.330 --> 00:25.500
And?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.830
They charged him
as your co-conspirator.

00:27.830 --> 00:29.380
They're investigating
Annalise.

00:29.380 --> 00:30.420
You tell them anything?

00:30.420 --> 00:31.460
No.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.620
But I might.

00:32.620 --> 00:33.960
We got a puppy problem.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.040
He knows Rebecca's dead.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.380
Just don't lose him.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.830
Oh!

00:53.830 --> 00:55.000
It's not a crosswalk,
genius!

00:58.330 --> 01:00.170
Why are they
questioning Wes?

01:00.170 --> 01:02.290
Is it because of Annalise's
investigation?

01:02.290 --> 01:04.210
I said I'm not
doing this here.

01:04.210 --> 01:06.540
If she goes down,
she's gonna take you with her.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.210
You know that.
What'd you say?

01:08.210 --> 01:10.420
You know how she gets
when she's desperate.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.960
Don't you ever
threaten me again.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.170
Hey.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.210
I lost him.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.420
He turned down an alley.
He's gone.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.620
Go to Annalise's.
He probably thinks she's there.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.500
I'll go to his apartment.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
Got it.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.920
Frank.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.620
Yeah.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.210
Do not hurt him.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.750
I won't.

01:40.750 --> 01:43.830
You, uh...
You okay, bud?

01:43.830 --> 01:44.790
Yeah.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.080
Just...

01:46.080 --> 01:47.960
Can you hurry?

01:47.960 --> 01:49.380
I'll do my best.

02:07.380 --> 02:08.750
It's Christophe.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.620
Yay to discharge day!

02:20.620 --> 02:24.000
Okay, that sounds grosser
out loud than it did in my head.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.120
Uh, yay to getting out of here
finally, is what I mean.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.500
I brought some options.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.790
Although I think
I need to see them on

02:32.790 --> 02:34.500
to know
which one looks best.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.000
Oh, there she go,
Casey Freakin' Anthony,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.040
off to another one of her
special hearings.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.120
Casey Anthony was acquitted,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.120
and you the only one in here
being charged

02:43.120 --> 02:44.620
with hurting
they own kids.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.540
Neglecting my kids.

02:46.540 --> 02:50.880
That's way different than
this one here murdering a boy.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.880
Next time you murder somebody,

02:53.880 --> 02:55.710
maybe you'll get
a special hearing, too.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.210
My client is an innocent woman
who is being unfairly targeted

03:26.210 --> 03:30.040
due to her association
with a sociopathic employee.

03:30.040 --> 03:35.040
Due to her association
with Mr. Delfino,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.120
a career criminal

03:37.120 --> 03:41.330
with a well-documented
history of violence,

03:41.330 --> 03:43.540
including a previous
attempted-murder case

03:43.540 --> 03:45.500
against his own father.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.790
Whereas my client

03:46.790 --> 03:49.540
has no criminal record
to speak of whatsoever.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.580
I thereby request
you sever their cases

I'm sorry.

-No.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.880
That is correct,
Your Honor.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.880
The Commonwealth
is amending the charges

05:18.880 --> 05:20.580
to list Mr. Delfino
and Ms. Keating

05:20.580 --> 05:22.170
as co-conspirators.

05:22.170 --> 05:24.500
Counsel may proceed
with the reading of charges.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.920
The defendants are charged

05:25.920 --> 05:27.710
with one count
of first-degree murder.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.290
A special circumstance...

05:29.290 --> 05:30.830
Did you know
they were gonna come?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.420
No.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.620
...alleging this conspiracy
was pre-meditated.

05:46.710 --> 05:51.000
So, Wes, uh,
where do I start?

05:52.040 --> 05:53.670
Um...

05:59.460 --> 06:03.290
Wes was a really great guy.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.880
Like, really just...

06:08.830 --> 06:10.250
Good.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.290
And that says a lot

06:17.290 --> 06:21.040
because he didn't really have
an easy life.

06:21.040 --> 06:21.880
No.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.830
It was actually really...dark.

06:25.830 --> 06:31.960
Like, his mom died
when he was 12 -- suicide.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.040
And then his father --

06:33.040 --> 06:34.580
Oh, God.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.670
Well, we don't really have time
to get into that.

06:36.670 --> 06:38.620
It's upsetting,
to say the least.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.620
Maybe you should have written
something for her.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.920
My point is,
it's awful, isn't it,

06:43.920 --> 06:47.210
that this is
what happened to him.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.040
Like...

06:51.540 --> 06:53.540
Why are you crying?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.330
Did you even know Wes?

06:57.330 --> 06:59.830
Did any of you?

06:59.830 --> 07:01.330
I take it that's a no?

07:01.330 --> 07:04.170
Law school isn't really
about making friends, right?

07:04.170 --> 07:06.380
Yeah, I bet some of you
are really happy that he's dead

07:06.380 --> 07:08.040
'cause that means
your ranking goes up one.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.210
Great.

07:09.210 --> 07:10.830
Okay, I'm going.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.920
Like, there's not even
a body to bury.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.540
You're all vultures
glomming onto this tragedy

07:15.540 --> 07:16.790
like it's your own.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.670
Well, it's not your tragedy!

07:18.670 --> 07:19.710
Please stop.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.920
It is Wes',
and he deserves better

07:21.920 --> 07:26.790
than this funeral
with you phony-ass people!

07:26.790 --> 07:31.000
So just go cry
somewhere else!

07:38.790 --> 07:41.380
Linking my client's case
to Mr. Delfino

07:41.380 --> 07:43.380
creates bias
in the eyes of the jury.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.290
I thereby move to sever
their cases

07:45.290 --> 07:47.500
to avoid any prejudice
against my client.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.120
Judge,
this is an arraignment.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.170
The Commonwealth is not prepared
to argue a motion to sever.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.710
Neither are we,
Your Honor.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.830
Ms. Winterbottom,
you can argue a motion to sever

07:55.830 --> 07:56.920
at a separate hearing.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.120
Are we finished?

07:58.120 --> 07:59.750
Your Honor, I'd also
like to revisit bail.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.080
Bail, Your Honor,
has already been denied.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.040
Only one defendant
in this courtroom

08:04.040 --> 08:06.620
has confessed in this crime,
and that is Mr. Delfino.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.040
Objection.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.750
My client's alleged confession
is not an issue here.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.920
Mr. Delfino has stated
he acted alone.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.000
Clearly pointing to undue
influence by Ms. Keating.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.080
Mr. Delfino never mentioned
any involvement by my client.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.500
Judge, we're not here to argue
the facts of this case.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.210
I am advocating
for my client

08:20.210 --> 08:22.830
who has been unfairly lumped in
with an amoral reprobate.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.290
Objection!
Ms. Keating
has no violent record,

08:25.290 --> 08:26.880
unlike Mr. Delfino!
I request your censure

08:26.880 --> 08:28.290
Ms. Winterbottom for recklessly
impugning my client!

08:28.290 --> 08:29.580
Enough.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.170
Ms. Winterbottom,
outbursts of this nature

08:32.170 --> 08:33.920
can only hurt your client.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.120
Ms. Keating's bail
continues to be denied.

08:37.540 --> 08:39.670
Don't go at her
that hard anymore.
That's my job.

08:39.670 --> 08:41.330
No, your job is to do
what I say.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.290
It's her parents.
Can you give them a minute?

08:54.290 --> 08:55.120
They can visit in prison.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.210
Go home, Mama.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.710
No! We'll come see you
right away, Anna Mae!

08:58.710 --> 09:00.540
I mean it!
Go home, Mama!
Anna Mae!

09:07.500 --> 09:08.710

09:10.790 --> 09:12.790
I'm sorry about all this.

09:12.790 --> 09:13.880
Don't be sorry.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.290
Just tell us
how you gonna fix it!

09:16.290 --> 09:19.330
I work
for the D.A.'s office now.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.750
You mean for the people
trying to convict her?

09:21.750 --> 09:23.330
You know
she didn't do this.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.880
I know.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.620
But any involvement by me
would just look suspicious.

09:27.620 --> 09:30.710
Not helping her
is what's gonna look suspicious.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.540
You saw her, Nathaniel.
She needs you.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.620
Don't let me have to get down
on these old knees

09:36.620 --> 09:39.170
and beg you
to be halfway decent.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.040
I can't help, ma'am.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.080

you was a good man.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.880
Come on.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.080
Hello!

09:54.330 --> 09:55.920
Look who's back!

09:55.920 --> 09:57.460
We knew it!

09:57.460 --> 09:59.080
How did it go?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.250
Well, that's okay.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.960
You still got lots of rounds
of fight left in you.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.250
Is it 'cause she a lawyer?

10:07.250 --> 10:08.830
Is that why you keep
suckin' up?

10:08.830 --> 10:11.080
'Cause I've been your roomie
for months now,

10:11.080 --> 10:13.330
and you don't give
no kinds of damn about my case.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.620
Wrong.

10:14.620 --> 10:17.040
I don't give a damn

10:17.040 --> 10:18.460
Yeah, whatever.

10:22.460 --> 10:23.790

10:23.790 --> 10:25.750
Maybe I'd help you, too,
if you shut your mouth for once.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.210
Please.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.580
In what world
can your child-murdering ass

10:29.580 --> 10:31.000
help me with my case?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.120
He wasn't my child!

10:33.120 --> 10:34.920
Keep coming at me.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.710
Come on.

10:36.710 --> 10:39.420
Maybe I will murder someone.

10:41.380 --> 10:48.120
Annalise the Hood-rat,
that's my new name for you.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.500
Why can't we talk
to her?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.250
Because she's asking
too many questions.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.670
Well, yeah, she dated Wes.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.500
Of course she's gonna be
asking questions.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.420
Or she's a spy
trying to bring us all down.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.380
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.420
Laurel was right.

11:03.420 --> 11:05.920
None of us knew Wes
like you all did,

11:05.920 --> 11:08.380
and I can't imagine
what you must all be feeling.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.250
Thanks.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.830
Sorry.
Um, I have to ask.

11:13.830 --> 11:15.380
Ask what?

11:15.380 --> 11:18.000
Keating.
Like, she did it, right?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.460
You're serious?

11:20.460 --> 11:22.420
Oh, my God. Don't tell me
you're still defending her.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.420
Innocent until proven guilty,
or are you as dumb as you look?

11:24.420 --> 11:25.420
Wes was your friend.

11:25.420 --> 11:26.880
The only thing he deserves
right now

11:26.880 --> 11:28.880
is for you not to defend
the woman who killed him.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.960
Hey, this is a memorial.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.210
We all came here to grieve,

11:31.210 --> 11:32.500
and you think
it's appropriate

11:32.500 --> 11:34.210
to be pouring salt
in the wounds?

11:34.210 --> 11:35.620
Dude, I'm just speaking
the truth.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.210
No, you're a horrible person
and you need to leave.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.210
I'm sorry.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.330
She wasn't in the bathroom

11:43.330 --> 11:45.330
and she's not answering
her phone.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.920
Maybe she got
an Uber home.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.380
Maybe she found a bridge
to jump off.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.000
Everyone call her.

11:56.710 --> 11:57.830
Hi.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.250
Can I see
my boyfriend's body?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.040
His name is Wes Gibbins.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.790
Are you okay, hon?

12:03.790 --> 12:05.460
Yeah.
Can I see him?

12:05.460 --> 12:08.750
G-I-B-B-I-N-S.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.420
The D.A.'s office
is holding Mr. Gibbins' remains

12:11.420 --> 12:13.500
as evidence
until the end of his trial.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.460
But I'm his girlfriend.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.420
I understand.
It's just --
I don't think you do.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.670
I've been in the hospital
until today,

12:19.670 --> 12:22.920
and I almost died
in the same fire that he did,

12:22.920 --> 12:24.790
which is why I never

12:24.790 --> 12:28.880
got the, you know,
the chance to say goodbye.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.210
Honey, there are
strict rules here.

12:31.210 --> 12:34.540
I'm pregnant
with his child.

12:37.670 --> 12:41.040
Talk to the D.A.'s office.
My hands are tied.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.330
You're going to hell
someday.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.170
It's Laurel.

12:48.170 --> 12:49.710
Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.580
Call me back
so I know you're okay.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.620
We'll find her.
I promise.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.330
Just hope
she's not dead when we do.

12:57.330 --> 13:00.460
I don't know if I can take
another one of these memorials.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.170
Is that her?

13:02.170 --> 13:03.920
It's a blocked call.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.170
Because it's her.
Answer it!

13:07.580 --> 13:08.580
This is Oliver.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.620
Mr. Hampton?

13:09.620 --> 13:10.920
Yeah?

13:10.920 --> 13:14.000
This is Detective Davis
with the Philadelphia Police.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.670
Do you have any time
to stop by later today?

13:16.670 --> 13:17.710
Um...

13:17.710 --> 13:21.120
She said they want
to interview me.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.750
-About Annalise?
-I don't know.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.250
He can't talk
to them, right?

13:24.250 --> 13:25.460
I told her
I'd be there at 2:00.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.580
You shouldn't
have said that.

13:26.580 --> 13:27.920
Look, I didn't think
I had a choice!

13:27.920 --> 13:28.960
This is a disaster.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.120
He needs a lawyer, right?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.620
What kind of lawyer
can we get in two hours?

13:31.620 --> 13:33.210
Okay, we can hide him,
like Annalise did with Wes.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.750
Look how that worked out
for him.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.790
They must know that
he hacked the D.A.'s office.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.250
No, Oli put up firewalls!

13:38.250 --> 13:39.460
Well, they didn't work,
did they?

13:39.460 --> 13:40.620
What if Laurel
went to the police?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.960
No, you're being paranoid.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.540
You didn't see her
at the memorial this morning.

13:43.540 --> 13:44.710
-She lost it.
-People...

13:44.710 --> 13:46.120
To the point
that I wouldn't be surprised

13:46.120 --> 13:47.210
if she went to confess
everything.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.250
People!

13:48.250 --> 13:51.830
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

14:07.790 --> 14:09.580
Baby.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.710
My baby.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.500
I fixed you a plate,

14:13.500 --> 14:17.290
but the guards made me leave it
in the car.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.170
It's okay.

14:18.170 --> 14:20.420
It's not okay.
Look at you.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.880
You're just nothing
but skin and bones.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.750
You got to eat, Anna Mae.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.330
I'm eating, Mama.

14:26.330 --> 14:29.080
I told Celestine
not to let you come.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.580
She didn't know.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.170
Your mama and me took off
in the middle of the night

14:33.170 --> 14:34.380
like a couple of car thieves.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.500
Point being,
we're here now.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.170
For as long as it takes
to get you out.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.330
No.

14:42.330 --> 14:45.460
I've never seen you
quite so low, baby.

14:45.460 --> 14:49.420
And who but your family can lift
you up out of this mess, hmm?

14:49.420 --> 14:52.250
I gave that Nathaniel
a good talking to.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.330
What?

14:53.330 --> 14:55.580
What kind of man
wouldn't help his woman?

14:55.580 --> 14:59.250
It's okay.
We're here to help you now.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.620
Whatever needs to be done,

15:00.620 --> 15:02.120
whether it's bringing you food

15:02.120 --> 15:03.790
or coming to be with you
every day.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.170
'Cause you think
that's what I want?

15:06.170 --> 15:08.290
You seeing me
in here like this?

15:13.750 --> 15:14.620
I'm gonna fix this.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.580
No, you can't, Mama.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.380
I can. I can.

15:18.380 --> 15:23.170
All I have to do
is to tell the police the truth.

15:23.170 --> 15:26.460
You didn't
burn down the house.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.670
I did.

15:27.670 --> 15:30.210
Ophelia...

15:30.210 --> 15:33.250
I'll tell them
that I made sure

15:33.250 --> 15:36.250
all the kids
was out of the house.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.460
And then I poured hooch

15:39.460 --> 15:44.500
all over the couch
that Clyde was on.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.040
Mama, stop.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.710
They got to know
what that pervert did to you.

15:49.710 --> 15:53.210
And that you're here
to take the fall for your mama.

15:53.210 --> 15:55.620
I'm not gonna let you
do that, baby.

15:55.620 --> 15:59.460
They want to lock me up,
that's fine.

15:59.460 --> 16:04.620
The only judgment I fear
is from the Lord God Almighty.

16:04.620 --> 16:09.040
And if I go to hell for burning
that bastard, then so be it.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.330
Why didn't you tell me?

16:24.330 --> 16:26.830
The doctor said
it's just a bit of dementia.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.500
You should have told me.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.540
She has episodes
every now and again,

16:30.540 --> 16:33.120
but she usually comes
out of them pretty quick.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.420
She just confessed
to burning down the house

16:35.420 --> 16:36.880
with your brother inside.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.330
She makes up stories.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.540
It wasn't a story.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.210
What?

16:41.210 --> 16:43.670
That's it, you two.
Come back tomorrow.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.120
We'll all still be here.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.120
Mr. Hampton,
what exactly is it you do

16:52.120 --> 16:54.290
for the Middleton
Legal Clinic?

16:54.290 --> 16:57.250
I was hired
as a technology expert,

16:57.250 --> 16:59.120
keeping case files locked.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.620
Did that include any of
Annalise's personal case files?

17:02.620 --> 17:03.790
No.
Just the clinic.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.330
Good job.

17:05.330 --> 17:07.000
I have
a question for you, son.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.040
Was it normal
for this professor of yours

17:09.040 --> 17:10.830
to require you to do
illegal hacking?

17:10.830 --> 17:12.670
I wouldn't say it was normal.

17:12.670 --> 17:17.290
So it was odd
that she called you at 8:52 p.m.

17:17.290 --> 17:18.710
the night of the fire?

17:18.710 --> 17:21.250
She was only asking me
to look into a pro bono case.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.500
It's better if you keep your
answers as vague as possible.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.620
That way, you technically
won't have to lie.

17:27.620 --> 17:30.040
She wanted me
to do some research.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.330
And did Keating ask you

17:31.330 --> 17:33.500
to do anything else
for her that night?

17:33.500 --> 17:34.420
Like what?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.880
Just answer the question.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.620
Did she ask you to clear
any files on her phone or not?

17:39.620 --> 17:42.500
No, she didn't ask me to do
anything illegal like that.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.080
Do you expect me
to believe that?
Yes!

17:44.080 --> 17:45.420
Then why are you sweating?

17:47.580 --> 17:50.790
Wes was my friend.

17:50.790 --> 17:54.380
And he was murdered.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.330
Okay?

17:55.330 --> 17:57.710
So, forgive me if my mind

17:57.710 --> 18:01.540
is a little foggy
on some of the details.

18:01.540 --> 18:05.080
I'm in no rush.
Take your time.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.420
Thanks.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.080
I do want to know why you
went back to the Legal Clinic

18:09.080 --> 18:10.830
after talking
to Professor Keating

18:10.830 --> 18:12.120
at the scene of the fire.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.420
He can't do this.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.790
Yes, I can!

18:14.790 --> 18:16.170
You need to call,
buy yourself more time.

18:16.170 --> 18:18.080
No!
You need to get him
out of this.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.040
Connor, I can do this.
You don't need
to protect us, Oli--

18:20.040 --> 18:23.580
I'm protecting myself!

18:23.580 --> 18:28.960
I am the one who decided
to get involved, okay?

18:28.960 --> 18:33.420
No one forced my hand
or threatened me.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.000
I did this willingly.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.960
And now I have to face
the consequences.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.540
Keep going.
I can take it.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.710
We have records showing
that you swiped into the clinic

18:48.710 --> 18:51.830
at 10:53 p.m. that night.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.420
Was it because
Professor Keating

18:53.420 --> 18:55.290
asked you to go do something
for her?

18:55.290 --> 18:59.500
Clear her phone of suspicious
material, for example?

18:59.500 --> 19:03.750
Of course not!

19:03.750 --> 19:05.920
That would be illegal.

19:08.250 --> 19:11.080
I told her I only went
to the legal clinic

19:11.080 --> 19:14.500
because I was an emotional wreck
and I didn't where else to go.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.330
Yes, girl.

19:16.330 --> 19:18.000
You did good.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.670
Thanks.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.000
Did we find Laurel?

19:24.420 --> 19:27.540
Please open the door
if you're in there.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.290
Laurel!

19:30.290 --> 19:32.920
I'm gonna kill you
if you're alive in there!

19:41.920 --> 19:45.420
You're out of the hospital.
How are you feeling?

19:45.420 --> 19:46.420
Better.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.040
You told me
I could come and see you

19:48.040 --> 19:49.790
and talk to you
when I was ready.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.040
No, I told you
to talk to me

19:51.040 --> 19:53.040
when you finally
wanted to come clean.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.960
So unless you're here
to say you didn't actually

19:54.960 --> 19:56.210
see Frank in the basement
that night --

19:56.210 --> 19:57.210
I did!

19:57.210 --> 19:58.540
Got to go.

19:58.540 --> 20:00.620
Can you help me see Wes?

20:00.620 --> 20:04.960
The D.A. has his remains
booked as evidence.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.790
Then you're out of luck.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.830
Imagine if you couldn't have
said goodbye to your wife!

20:12.710 --> 20:14.580
You can get me in, right?

20:29.710 --> 20:31.620
The burns are pretty bad.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.750
It's okay.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.580
You honestly want me to believe
you just lost the body?

21:17.580 --> 21:18.790
-We're gonna find it.
-You better.

21:18.790 --> 21:20.380
-Nate --
-Otherwise, you're gonna have

21:20.380 --> 21:22.420
a lot of people thinking
there's a conspiracy going on.
Stop.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.750
I won't be surprised if the
judge throws out the whole case!
Exactly.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.210
Because the victim's girlfriend
now knows we lost his body!

21:27.210 --> 21:28.750
You want
to blame this on me?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.040
Why don't you just tell us
why you took her there.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.920
Because you asked me
to get close to her.

21:31.920 --> 21:32.710
Please.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.330
This is not my fault.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.170
By taking
Ms. Castillo there,

21:36.170 --> 21:38.960
you handed Annalise her defense
on a platter.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.920
Gross negligence,
denial of due process.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.920
Tampering with evidence.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.960
I ordered a second autopsy
so they'll have to come clean.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.960
It's awful to think about,
I know.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.880
But unless they find his body,
this helps your case.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.750
My mother has dementia.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.960
It's fine.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.210
Just call my doctor's office
and ask them

22:08.210 --> 22:10.790
if they can recommend
any long-term care facilities.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.000
Okay.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.710
Some place close.

22:14.710 --> 22:17.460
Celestine's gonna fight me
on this,

22:17.460 --> 22:20.540
but she hid it from me, too,
so I don't care.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.960
What?

22:26.960 --> 22:28.540
I'm getting you
out of here.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.080
Stop saying that.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.960
They lost his body.
It proves you're being framed.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.960
It doesn't prove anything,
and you know it.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.210
Just help me with my mother.

22:43.210 --> 22:47.540
At least that's something
we can fix.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.250
Gentlemen, we dodged
a big-ass bullet today

23:03.250 --> 23:05.880
thanks to the O-man's
baller cop-lying skills.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.420
Can you keep it down?
The walls are super thin.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.330
Okay. Whatever.

23:10.330 --> 23:11.830
A toast!

23:11.830 --> 23:15.620
To Oli,
for being a great liar,

23:15.620 --> 23:19.210
and most importantly,
to Wes.

23:19.210 --> 23:24.580
We might not have given you
the proper memorial, but...

23:24.580 --> 23:26.670
we can still pour one out
for you.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.670
Sorry.
I'll get paper towels.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.170
You mad at me?

23:44.170 --> 23:46.960
A little.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.500
To Wes.

23:52.420 --> 23:53.880
Do you think
I like this?

23:53.880 --> 23:55.880
Believe me,
the last thing I want to do

23:55.880 --> 23:57.170
is act like your mother.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.750
Really? 'Cause you're way
better at it than my mother.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.170
I'm good
at everything I do!

24:02.170 --> 24:05.330
I'm just saying, it's cruel
to not answer your phone.

24:05.330 --> 24:06.290
I'm sorry.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.750
Don't apologize.

24:07.750 --> 24:11.040
Just promise me
you won't go A.W.O.L. again.

24:16.420 --> 24:19.170
I'm sleeping on the couch.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.710
No.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.170
Asher farts in his sleep.
I could use a night off.

24:24.540 --> 24:27.670
Do you think he did it?

24:27.670 --> 24:28.960
Frank?

24:32.420 --> 24:34.040
I want to believe he did

24:34.040 --> 24:36.750
'cause then that way
I'd have someone to hate.

24:39.670 --> 24:46.210
But if he didn't, then whoever
killed Wes is still out there.

24:46.210 --> 24:49.250
I just wish we knew.

24:49.250 --> 24:52.960
Okay, I'm too old to sleep
on the couch.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.290
Scoot.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.420
Hey!
Look at my babies!

25:16.830 --> 25:20.170
Mmm!

25:20.170 --> 25:23.120
Give me a hug!

25:27.960 --> 25:29.290
Let's go sit.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.380
Oh, my baby.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.170
I'm the mother.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.750
You're the child.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.830
And the last thing
you should be doing right now

25:43.830 --> 25:45.120
is worrying about me.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.920
It's just that I think we need
to have a plan in place.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.000
I got that covered.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.040
-You do?
-Yes.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.620
I'm gonna be with your mother
every day, stay by her side,

25:54.620 --> 25:57.750
make sure she doesn't go
shoplifting any supermarkets...

25:57.750 --> 25:59.210
Oh, shut your mouth!

26:00.420 --> 26:02.710
How do I know
you won't get bored

26:02.710 --> 26:05.710
and run off someplace
like you always do?

26:05.710 --> 26:08.210
Excuse me.

26:08.210 --> 26:09.250
Where are you going?

26:09.250 --> 26:11.540
You two need to talk.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.710
I'm going to utilize
the facilities

26:14.710 --> 26:18.920
and give you two time
to fix this thing,

26:18.920 --> 26:20.620
whatever it is.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.040
Ophelia --

26:22.040 --> 26:24.000
I said fix it!

26:31.120 --> 26:32.540
I didn't know.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.790
Which part?

26:34.790 --> 26:37.790
'Cause I told you
what he did to me.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.540
Celestine's
13th birthday party.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.040
You showed up drunk.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.540
I brought you a piece of Mama's
peach cobbler out on the porch.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.880
Or are you having
memory problems, too?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.880
I meant I didn't know about
the fire, that your mother --

26:49.880 --> 26:51.420
You said you didn't
believe me.

26:51.420 --> 26:52.620
Anna Mae, listen --

26:52.620 --> 26:55.000
And how was I supposed
to make you believe me, huh?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.580
You want proof?
Pictures?

26:56.580 --> 26:57.920
I don't remember --

26:57.920 --> 26:59.120
You remember.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.880
I just let you ignore it.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.040
You were always so good
at ignoring things.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.000
I'm sorry, okay?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.670
I should have said more,
done more.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.880
But he was dead.
I was hoping it was over.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.080
It's still not over.
Look at me.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.500
You think me ending up here
had nothing to do with it?

27:19.500 --> 27:24.830
You want to blame me
for your sad childhood?

27:24.830 --> 27:28.330
Maybe I deserve that,
but you do not get to sit here

27:28.330 --> 27:31.500
and blame me for where
you're sitting right now.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.540
This mess is all you.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.620
Well, if you think that,
then maybe we should be done.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.120
You go your way
and I go mine.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.750
This is your pain talking,
Anna Mae.

27:39.750 --> 27:40.920
All I have is pain!

27:40.920 --> 27:42.830
We all got pain.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.460
You know, there's enough pain
in this one room

27:45.460 --> 27:47.540
to make me curl up in a ball
and give up.

27:47.540 --> 27:51.620
Which proves my point.
You ain't special.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.080
What you are is selfish.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.460
'Cause if you really wanted
to help your mama,

27:57.460 --> 28:00.710
you'd be trying to get your ass
out of this jail!

28:03.170 --> 28:05.330
Tell your mother
I'll be in the lobby.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.750
It's noon.
You have to get up.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.250
I don't, actually.
Laurel.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.790
President Hargrove said we don't
have to go to class yet.

28:18.790 --> 28:21.790
You have a meeting
with Frank in an hour.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.210
I called
his public defender,

28:23.210 --> 28:25.250
said I was your lawyer
from the Middleton Clinic

28:25.250 --> 28:26.710
and told him
it was your legal right

28:26.710 --> 28:29.000
to confront the man accused
of killing your boyfriend.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.380
I also pointed out
it could benefit his case

28:32.380 --> 28:34.250
to have the victim provide

28:34.250 --> 28:36.210
sympathetic input
for sentencing.

28:38.750 --> 28:43.540
So, go, get your answer.

28:46.670 --> 28:48.960
My client has agreed
to this recorded meeting

28:48.960 --> 28:51.580
and wishes to show his remorse
prior to sentencing.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.540
Now, this is not
an interview,

28:53.540 --> 28:56.210
and if there is any exchange
that I deem detrimental

28:56.210 --> 28:59.040
to my client's case,
I will end things here.

28:59.040 --> 28:59.880
Clear?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.830
Yes.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.120
I'm sorry.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.000
For what?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.880
Everything.

29:16.750 --> 29:21.170
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.960
I guess I just wanted to look
you in the eye finally

29:23.960 --> 29:25.920
'cause I haven't
wanted to believe

29:25.920 --> 29:28.960
that it's true
that you did...

29:28.960 --> 29:31.920
that you did that to Wes.

29:36.540 --> 29:42.750
But I saw you leave
the basement, so...

29:46.210 --> 29:48.080
I guess I just have to believe
my own eyes.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.380
I should, right?

29:52.380 --> 29:53.380
Do not answer that.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.040
What were his last words,
Frank?

30:00.040 --> 30:01.670
Okay. Meeting's over.

30:01.670 --> 30:02.670
Guard!

30:02.670 --> 30:03.670
Tell me his last words.

30:03.670 --> 30:04.790
Enough.

30:04.790 --> 30:06.290
Tell me so that I can
finally move on.

30:06.290 --> 30:07.880
I said that we are
through here!

30:07.880 --> 30:10.330
Tell me what his last words
were, Frank!

30:15.790 --> 30:18.080
He didn't do it.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.460
He told you that.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.330
He couldn't.
His lawyer was there.

30:21.330 --> 30:22.380
Then how do you know?

30:22.380 --> 30:23.880
Did he blink twice
or something?

30:23.880 --> 30:25.000
I just know.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.710
And I know
that he did it.

30:26.710 --> 30:27.920
He didn't.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.000
This wasn't Frank.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.330
Because it was you?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.500
Okay, everyone needs
to just chill.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.830
Annalise is being framed.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.170
That's right.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.920
You know, I forgot.
Who's doing that today?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.290
The Mahoneys
or the D.A.?

30:41.290 --> 30:42.830
-Connor.
-What?

30:42.830 --> 30:44.710
It is possible
that Frank did this.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.670
Thinking that does
not make me crazy.

30:46.670 --> 30:47.880
Then stop acting crazy.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.960
Nobody's crazy.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.750
We're all crazy!
I mean, God, look at us.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.250
We're sitting around debating
who murdered our friend.

30:53.250 --> 30:56.580
Your friend?
You treated him like crap.

30:56.580 --> 30:57.710
You still are!

30:57.710 --> 30:59.290
Uh, no, I'm not.

30:59.290 --> 31:02.750
His body is missing, Connor!
Do you even care about that?

31:02.750 --> 31:03.920
Do any of you?

31:03.920 --> 31:05.330
-Laurel, we all feel bad.
-Yeah.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.210
Then think about
what that means!

31:07.210 --> 31:09.380
And not just for you,
but for Wes.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.460
Somebody killed him,
burned his body,

31:11.460 --> 31:13.710
and misplaced it!

31:13.710 --> 31:15.500
And it wasn't Frank.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.620
Maybe none of you can understand
how I know that,

31:19.620 --> 31:22.750
but he just wouldn't
do that to me.

31:22.750 --> 31:26.620
No matter what he's saying,
so just --

31:26.620 --> 31:29.580
We need to find out
who did this.

31:35.330 --> 31:38.380
This is Bonnie.

31:38.380 --> 31:40.460
Due to an unfortunate
clerical error,

31:40.460 --> 31:42.880
the body of Mr. Gibbins
has been misplaced.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.000
The M.E. is performing
an escalated search to find him.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.210
Your Honor,
I find it very convenient

31:48.210 --> 31:50.210
that this clerical error
coincides

31:50.210 --> 31:51.790
with my request
for a second autopsy.

31:51.790 --> 31:53.330
I'm not sure
what you're insinuating.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.420
Your office is purposely
hiding evidence

31:55.420 --> 31:57.670
that will exonerate
my client.

31:57.670 --> 32:00.000
Hold up. Ms. Winterbottom.
Are you accusing me
of willful misconduct?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.170
I don't see how my client
can get a fair trial

32:02.170 --> 32:04.210
without the ability
to fully examine the victim.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.210
Well, let me remind you,

32:05.210 --> 32:07.000
there's already been
an official autopsy.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.460
On a body
that's now missing.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.380
This is a grossly
negligent error.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.420
That will be corrected
the minute we locate the victim.

32:12.420 --> 32:13.920
This is a civil rights issue,
Your Honor.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.290
Excuse me?

32:15.290 --> 32:17.420
The D.A.'s office
continues to railroad

32:17.420 --> 32:19.540
a prominent
African-American female attorney

32:19.540 --> 32:21.330
based on a personal
vendetta.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.000
All the evidence
is circumstantial,

32:23.000 --> 32:24.420
another man has confessed,

32:24.420 --> 32:26.620
and now the victim's body
is M.I.A.?

32:26.620 --> 32:30.500
What other proof do I need to
get my client released on bail?

32:34.080 --> 32:36.420
The judge denied
my request for bail.

32:36.420 --> 32:39.290
Clearly she's part of this.
They all are.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.920
Which is why I want to push
for a judicial recusal.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.830
Or file an ethical complaint
for bias.

32:43.830 --> 32:47.000
If we can get a new judge...

32:47.000 --> 32:48.210
Annalise?

33:14.710 --> 33:17.710
Your boys seem nice.
How old?

33:17.710 --> 33:21.250
Luis is 8, Tyrone 12.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.250
Mm.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.380
Such a shame.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.420
They already know how much
of a disappointment you are.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.670
Excuse me?

33:29.670 --> 33:31.580
They probably celebrated

33:31.580 --> 33:33.250
when you were hauled
off to jail,

33:33.250 --> 33:35.000
relieved that they didn't
have to deal

33:35.000 --> 33:36.210
with your cracked-out mess
anymore.

33:36.210 --> 33:37.290
Shut your mouth.

33:37.290 --> 33:39.210
They don't love you.
I saw it on their faces.

33:39.210 --> 33:40.830
Say something else
about my boys.

33:40.830 --> 33:42.830
Your sons wince
when you hug them. Why?

33:42.830 --> 33:43.880
Okay, cool it.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.620
-Did you touch them?
-Shut up.

33:45.620 --> 33:46.960
That's it, isn't it?

33:46.960 --> 33:48.880
You didn't just neglect them.
You molested them.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.750
They were too afraid
to say anything,

33:50.750 --> 33:52.330
sexually abused
by their own mother.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.830
Shut up!

33:53.830 --> 33:57.670
Guard! Guard! Guard!

34:03.580 --> 34:05.330
Oh, my God.

34:05.330 --> 34:08.170
Annalise, what happened.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.420
Take a picture.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.880
Annalise.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.040
I said take a picture.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.670
The other inmates know who
she is and are targeting her.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.460
The Commonwealth
can move Ms. Keating

34:23.460 --> 34:24.790
into solitary confinement.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.500
If Ms. Keating
isn't released on bail,

34:26.500 --> 34:28.250
I'm releasing these photos
to the press

34:28.250 --> 34:30.080
and announcing
a very public lawsuit

34:30.080 --> 34:32.290
against the D.A.'s office
for civil rights violations.

34:32.290 --> 34:34.710
It's months before the trial.

34:34.710 --> 34:38.290
She'll be dead
if we leave her in that jail.

34:38.290 --> 34:39.710
Who the hell are you?

34:39.710 --> 34:40.960
Beyoncé.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.210
Who the hell are you?

34:46.500 --> 34:48.460
Release her
on conditional bail.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.580
Take away her passport.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.790
She'll pose no flight risk.

34:56.500 --> 35:03.120
♪ In the end I saw you ♪

35:03.120 --> 35:05.080
It looks worse than it feels.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.380
Oh, baby.

35:07.380 --> 35:09.330
They hurt you.

35:09.330 --> 35:12.540
They hurt you.

35:15.880 --> 35:19.580
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you let them see you cry.

35:19.580 --> 35:20.960
Don't you let them.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.290
It's Laurel.

35:22.290 --> 35:24.830
Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.

35:24.830 --> 35:28.210
Where are you?

35:28.210 --> 35:32.040
That bitch better not be in
New York stalking the Mahoneys.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.830
You know what's good
is that now that Annalise

35:33.830 --> 35:35.120
is out of jail,
it's her job

35:35.120 --> 35:36.500
to take care of everyone,
not yours.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.790
Are you kidding?

35:37.790 --> 35:40.330
It just means
I'm gonna have to worry more.

35:41.790 --> 35:45.420
Is it bad if I want her
to stay in there?

35:45.420 --> 35:47.000
Well, a little.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.330
Would it help
if I let you fornicate with me?

35:51.330 --> 35:52.960
Shut up.

35:56.330 --> 35:58.960
Actually, yes.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.830
♪ And I knew it would be you ♪

36:12.170 --> 36:14.460
Um, are -- are you okay?

36:14.460 --> 36:16.000
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.330
I was just remembering
how Laurel went off

36:20.330 --> 36:23.880
on all those crying people
at Wes' memorial.

36:23.880 --> 36:27.330
And then I got called
into the police station

36:27.330 --> 36:29.210
and I lied to their faces.

36:31.710 --> 36:35.170
Aw, are you worried
about me?

36:35.170 --> 36:36.120
Nah.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.330
Just learning a lot
about you.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.670
Like what?

36:41.670 --> 36:44.540
Like you're
a really good liar.

36:44.540 --> 36:47.000
Eh, not really.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.920
Sure, you are.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.330
I mean, first,
my Stanford acceptance,

36:52.330 --> 36:54.750
now the cops.

36:54.750 --> 36:58.000
Plus your pants are
almost always on fire, so...

36:58.000 --> 36:59.790
I am a good liar.

36:59.790 --> 37:03.080
I know.
I just said that.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.460
There's another lie,
is what I mean.

37:07.460 --> 37:10.710
You know, the first thing
you learn when you hack a system

37:10.710 --> 37:12.880
is to make sure
you have an escape route

37:12.880 --> 37:14.670
that only you
know about.

37:14.670 --> 37:18.330
I erased Annalise's phone
that night.

37:18.330 --> 37:20.080
Yeah, I know.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.290
Yeah, but I saved a copy.

38:27.670 --> 38:30.040
You are receiving
a call from an inmate

38:30.040 --> 38:32.120
at Philadelphia Country Prison.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.380
This call is being recorded.
To accept the charges, press 3.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.500
Hello?

38:39.500 --> 38:41.670
Hey. It's me.

38:41.670 --> 38:44.170
Mr. Delfino,
it is an ethical violation

38:44.170 --> 38:45.960
for you
to be calling me.

38:45.960 --> 38:46.880
It's fine.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.080
If you have
anything to say,

38:48.080 --> 38:49.500
you need to say it
through your lawyer.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.290
You're speaking to him.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.710
What?

38:52.710 --> 38:54.750
I fired the guy.
I'm gonna represent myself.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.420
We're co-counsel now.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.210
We get to meet in private,

38:58.210 --> 39:01.500
all communications
between us are privileged.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.380
So, when do you want to have
our first meeting?

39:06.960 --> 39:10.210
Celestine's gonna expect
a call tomorrow.

39:10.210 --> 39:12.750
And Thelonius.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.710
They'll be so relieved
to hear

39:14.710 --> 39:17.420
you're not locked up
in that hellhole anymore.

39:17.420 --> 39:20.540
Mama? What's wrong?

39:20.540 --> 39:23.420
You should have let me
tell them.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.460
You're my baby girl.

39:27.460 --> 39:31.170
You don't deserve to be in jail
for something I did.

39:31.170 --> 39:35.710
Ophelia, we're not talking
about that right now.

39:35.710 --> 39:37.580
Those police
are trying to take

39:37.580 --> 39:40.330
my baby girl's life away
before it's even started!

39:40.330 --> 39:47.290
She needs to be married
and have babies

39:47.290 --> 39:52.670
and not be rotting away
in some j-j-jail.

39:52.670 --> 39:55.880
I'm not in jail
anymore, Mama.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.620
For now.
But you still got the trial.

39:59.620 --> 40:04.000
You know how those juries
like to send black folks away.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.880
No. No.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.210
Mama, they dropped
the charges.

40:07.210 --> 40:09.620
The judge told me today.
That's why I'm here.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.580
They did have enough evidence
so they let me go.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.540
No.

40:21.540 --> 40:22.420
Mm-hmm.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.080
-No.
-Yeah.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.290
No.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.170
Yeah, I'm here!

40:27.170 --> 40:27.920
It's over!

40:27.920 --> 40:30.250
Oh!

40:30.250 --> 40:31.960
I'm free, Mama.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.790
You hear me?

40:33.790 --> 40:34.670
God.

40:34.670 --> 40:36.880
Thank you, Jesus.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.080
Thank you.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.620
My baby girl.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.120
You were right.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.380
There seems to be a conspiracy
in the Wes Gibbins case.

41:02.380 --> 41:05.120
Someone signed off
on having his body transferred

41:05.120 --> 41:06.380
to another morgue.

41:06.380 --> 41:10.080
It's someone
on the inside.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.620
Who is it?

41:14.420 --> 41:16.040
You.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.750
You circling
a cause of death yet?

41:26.750 --> 41:29.420
He was already dead,
before the fire.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.210
Annalise?

41:44.330 --> 41:45.540
Annalise?

42:04.620 --> 42:06.040
Hey.

42:09.290 --> 42:10.920
Hey.
