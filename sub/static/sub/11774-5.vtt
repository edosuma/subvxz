WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:06.774
( theme music playing )

00:11.845 --> 00:14.415
( whistling )

00:25.893 --> 00:27.295
SORRY.
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.297
WHO ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.764
WHAT?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.066
WHO ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.802
UM, CHEE-YUN.

00:34.902 --> 00:38.439
- OH, I'M A HUGE FAN
OF CHEE-YUN'S.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.441
- I LOVE HER.
- ISN'T SHE FANTASTIC?

00:40.541 --> 00:43.577
I SAW HER AT DISNEY HALL.
I WAS IN SEATS RIGHT
DOWN FRONT.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.779
- OKAY, I WAS AT THAT CONCERT.
- YOU WERE?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.215
- YEAH.
- WELL, THEN YOU KNOW.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.517
- YOU WERE RIGHT DOWN FRONT?
- SHE'S FANTASTIC.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.918
YOU'RE GONNA BE
REALLY JEALOUS WHEN
I TELL YOU THIS.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.686
WHAT?

00:52.786 --> 00:55.556
I'M SEEING HER IN A PRIVATE
RECITAL AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.159
- OOH!
- I LOVE THE SOUND OF ENVY.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.461
- ( laughing )
- IT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.097
- YOU HAVE A CRUEL STREAK.
- MUSIC TO MY EARS.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.798
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I KNEW YOU BETTER
I'D INVITE YOU.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.668
YEAH, HOW DO WE
ARRANGE THAT?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.871
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
A LITTLE PREDATE.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.540
A PREDATE DATE.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.509
- A DATE BEFORE THE RECITAL.
- RIGHT.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.545
YOU'RE HALFWAY DECENT LOOKING.
I THINK WE COULD ARRANGE IT.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.646
- WOW, THANKS.
- YEAH.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.481
IT'S THOSE COMPLIMENTS
THAT JUST KEEP ME GOING.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.483
YEAH.
YEAH, LET'S ARRANGE IT.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.885
YOU'RE NOT SOME CREEPO
CREEP, ARE YOU?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.420
I AM.
I'M A TOTAL CREEP.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.223
( laughs )
OKAY, CREEPY.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.759
- I'M DENISE.
- I'M-- I'M LARRY.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.562
LARRY.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.606
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I HAD
TO FIRE BOBBY LAST WEEK.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.741
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A TECHNIQUE TO FIRING.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.279
- A TECHNIQUE?
- YEAH, BAD NEWS HAS TO BE
DELIVERED IN A CASUAL WAY.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.013
LIKE IT'S NOT--
LIKE IT'S NOT BAD NEWS.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.917
IF YOU DELIVER BAD NEWS
LIKE IT'S BAD NEWS,
IT'S GONNA BE BAD NEWS.

01:57.017 --> 02:00.221
IF YOU DELIVER BAD NEWS
LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
THEN IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.356
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE HOSPITAL, THE DOCTOR
COMES IN

02:02.456 --> 02:04.425
AND SAYS,
"OH GOOD, NICE SHADES.
YOU HAVE TERMINAL CANCER."

02:04.525 --> 02:06.827
THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.
THIS IS HOW A DOCTOR
SHOULD DO IT.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.062
- ( phone ringing )
- OH, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.432
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MEAN
AND INSENSITIVE, LARRY.
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.933
I'M THINKING ABOUT THEM,
TO LET THEM DOWN EASY.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.402
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.604
UM, I'M GONNA GO
GET SOME NEW SILVERWARE.

02:16.704 --> 02:20.241
AND BY THE WAY, SUSIE,
I SO WANT TO DIVORCE YOU.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.244
( both laughing )

02:23.344 --> 02:25.045
HEY, DID YOU CALL
THE WHEELCHAIR GIRL?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.781
- YEAH, I HAD TO.
- YEAH, YOU HAD NO CHOICE.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.384
- ONCE SHE WHEELED
OUT FROM THE TABLE...
- UH-HUH.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.486
I-- COME ON, WHAT COULD I DO?
I'M TAKING HER OUT TONIGHT.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.055
- YOU'RE GOING OUT TONIGHT?
- YEAH. I WAS STUCK.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.390
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO THINK
I WAS A BAD GUY.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.659
IT'S AN ADVENTURE.
IT'S AN ADVENTURE.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.295
- EXACTLY.
IT'S A NEW EXPERIENCE.
- IT'S GREAT, NEW EXPERIENCE.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.963
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
THE SEINFELD SHOW?

02:43.063 --> 02:45.499
- YOU WRITING IT?
- YEAH, STARTED WRITING.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.034
THIS IS GONNA BE
SO FANTASTIC.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.602
I KNOW, I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.504
- HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- HEY HEY.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.840
- NO PROBLEM.
- MY KID NEVER STOPS
CALLING ME ANYMORE.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.075
- HERE YOU ARE.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I HAD A GREAT TIME.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.610
- I GOT THAT.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.579
- IT WAS A WONDERFUL LUNCH.
- SERIOUSLY, I GOT THAT.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.648
- NO, I PUT MY HAND ON IT.
- SERIOUSLY, I INVITED YOU.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.516
COME ON, IT'S THE INVITER
WHO PICKS UP.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.552
I HAD FIRST DIBS.
I TOUCHED IT FIRST, LARRY.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.254
I ASKED, THOUGH.
I THINK THAT GETS PRIORITY.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.189
WHAT GETS PRIORITY
ON A CHECK, ASKER
OR TOUCHER?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.724
WHAT IS HE,
JUDGE JUDY?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.293
I PUT MY HAND
ON IT.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.927
YEAH, BUT I ASKED YOU
TO LUNCH, SO--

03:14.027 --> 03:16.029
YOU CAN'T JUST
GRAB THE CHECK

03:16.129 --> 03:18.366
IF SOMEONE HAS
THE CHECK, LARRY.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.701
- THAT IS ABSURDLY RUDE.
- ROSIE, I ASKED YOU TO LUNCH.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.237
- THIS IS MY PLEASURE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.307
NO. GIVE ME
THE CHECK, ROSIE.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.609
- DON'T YOU BE ABSURD.
- HEY, COME ON.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.077
HEY HEY HEY.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.680
HEY HEY, GET OFF.
COME ON. COME ON.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.552
- IS THAT LARRY? LARRY.
- IT IS YOU.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.389
- OH, HEY.
- WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.291
- REALLY?
- ARE YOU STILL
GONNA MAKE IT

03:43.391 --> 03:45.225
TO THE CHEE-YUN RECITAL
AT OUR HOUSE?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.494
ARE YOU KIDDING?
OF COURSE I'M COMING.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.496
I'M A HUGE FAN OF HERS.
MY GOD.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.564
- HAVE YOU GUYS MET?
- YOU'VE NEVER MET
KELSEY BEFORE.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.700
- HELLO, KELSEY.
- YES, THIS IS KELSEY.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.403
WE JUST GOT HER SIX MONTHS AGO.
LARRY, KELSEY; KELSEY, LARRY.

03:55.503 --> 03:59.072
HELLO, KELSEY.
KELSEY. KELSEY GRAMMER.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.443
- FRASIER.
- JUST KELSEY.
WE DON'T CALL HER FRASIER.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.111
- THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
- OH, NO?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.646
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION.
- YEAH?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.882
HAVE YOU NOTICED IF SHE HAS
ANY PROCLIVITY FOR CHOPSTICKS?

04:08.982 --> 04:11.985
- WHY?
- WHY WOULD SHE HAVE A
PROCLIVITY FOR CHOPSTICKS?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.423
- WELL, SHE'S CHINESE.
- DO YOU THINK SHE IS ALSO
A KUNG FU MASTER?

04:15.523 --> 04:17.658
NO, ALL I'M WONDERING
IS THIS:

04:17.758 --> 04:20.961
IF YOU TOOK AN AMERICAN
KID WHO'S NEVER USED
CHOPSTICKS BEFORE

04:21.061 --> 04:23.497
AND A CHINESE KID WHO'S NEVER
USED CHOPSTICKS BEFORE,

04:23.597 --> 04:26.967
WOULD THE CHINESE KID
DO BETTER?

04:27.067 --> 04:30.371
- SO THE AMERICAN KID IS
THE CONTROL GROUP IN--
- SHE USES A FORK.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.806
- DO ME A FAVOR.
- WHAT?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.843
FIRST TIME SHE USES
CHOPSTICKS, GIVE ME A CALL.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.011
- JUST LET ME KNOW.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE TO...

04:38.111 --> 04:41.014
GIVE ME A CALL AND SAY,
"YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS KID'S AMAZING."

04:41.114 --> 04:42.983
- GOT TO GO.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO THAT.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.185
LET ME ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION:

04:45.285 --> 04:47.788
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS

04:47.888 --> 04:50.223
THAT ONE OF THE BIOLOGICAL
PARENTS COULD BE A PSYCHOTIC?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.925
- OKAY, I THINK IT'S--
- I'M JUST SAYING.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.227
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A SCHIZOPHRENIC ON YOUR HANDS.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.331
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...
( grunts )

04:57.431 --> 04:59.600
- I HOPE NOT.
- WELL, SHE'S HEALTHY,
I THINK.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.335
- WE'D BETTER GO.
- YEAH, WE SHOULD HEAD OUT.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.405
- WE'LL TALK TO YOU, LARRY.
- BYE, KELSEY.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.840
- SEE YOU GUYS.
SEE YOU AT THE CONCERT.
- YEAH.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.944
- HEY, WE'RE WALKING
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.
- OH GOSH, REALLY?

05:11.044 --> 05:14.247
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SECOND
DATE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET AN ELECTRIC CHAIR.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.850
- WELL...
- I'M NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.954
THIS LOOKS NICE.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.029
WHERE'S THE RAMP?

05:29.129 --> 05:31.765
WHERE IS THE RAMP?

05:31.865 --> 05:34.502
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THERE'S NO RAMP?

05:34.602 --> 05:36.470
WELL, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T REALLY EAT HERE.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.639
- LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.708
BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE CAR
AND GET TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT
IT'S GONNA BE AN HOUR.

05:40.808 --> 05:44.378
- I'M STARVING.
- I CAN'T WALK.
I CAN'T--

05:44.478 --> 05:47.381
WELL, WHAT IF
I CARRIED YOU?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.817
- COME ON.
- I FEEL AWFUL.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.352
IT'LL BE ONE TWO THREE.
WE'LL BE UP THERE BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.354
( sighs )
OKAY.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.624
( groaning )

05:59.192 --> 06:01.094
LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.765
- I AM LIFTING WITH MY LEGS.
- DON'T CARRY IT ALL
ON YOUR BACK.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.734
( groaning )

06:06.834 --> 06:08.335
- LARRY, HURRY UP.
- HURRY UP?

06:08.436 --> 06:09.870
- HURRY UP.
- SHUT UP!

06:09.970 --> 06:12.606
- TWO MORE STEPS, GO.
- ( groaning )

06:12.706 --> 06:15.709
- OKAY.
- WHERE AM I GONNA
PUT YOU DOWN?

06:20.848 --> 06:23.417
( groans )

06:24.552 --> 06:26.887
JESUS, THAT REALLY
GOT MY BACK.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.389
YEAH.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.425
I FEEL IT RADIATING
DOWN MY LEG.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.661
HOW AM I GONNA
PLAY GOLF TOMORROW?

06:33.761 --> 06:36.163
SO YOU'LL TAKE
A DAY OFF MAYBE.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.631
I'LL TAKE A CART.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.833
YEAH, DON'T YOU
TAKE A CART ANYWAY?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.202
- NO, I USUALLY WALK.
- OH, REALLY?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.537
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.073
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.
I NEVER WALK.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.742
WALKING IS COMPLETELY OVERRATED.
WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD WALKING.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.744
ALWAYS TAKE A CART.
I'M NOT A WALKER.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.747
I WOULD THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE NICE TO
WALK ON A GOLF COURSE.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.749
NO, NOT NEARLY AS GOOD
AS TAKING A CART.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.785
IN FACT, I DON'T DO
MUCH WALKING AT ALL.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.455
GENERALLY I'M JUST WALKING
FROM ONE PLACE TO SIT TO
THE OTHER PLACE TO SIT.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.592
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT--
YOU CAN'T CLASSIFY ME
AS A WALKER.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
- I GOT IT.
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.296
- WHAT?
- I'M PICKING UP A VIBE HERE.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.864
CAN I BE PERFECTLY HONEST?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.801
WHEN I WALKED INTO YOUR HOUSE
YOU GAVE ME THIS LOOK LIKE,

07:13.901 --> 07:16.970
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE YOU WERE
DISAPPOINTED OR SOMETHING.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.207
- OKAY.
- AH.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.409
THE THING IS THAT WHEN--

07:22.510 --> 07:25.045
WHEN WE FIRST MET

07:25.145 --> 07:27.681
YOU WERE WEARING A HAT.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.151
AND THEN YOU CAME TO THE DOOR
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHO'S THIS?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.053
OH OH!"

07:33.153 --> 07:35.923
BECAUSE YOU ARE BALD.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.191
YOU'RE BALD AND I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT YOU WERE BALD.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.293
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.195
- IT'S REALLY NOT A PROBLEM.
- I GET IT.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.498
I GET IT.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.501
I HAD A HAT ON
AND THEN BALDY SHOWED UP.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.669
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.303
YOU FEEL I
MISREPRESENTED MYSELF.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.006
- YOU THOUGHT I WAS A HAIR MAN.
- IT WAS JUST DIFFERENT.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.809
- IS IT A PROBLEM FOR YOU?
- NO, IS IT A PROBLEM FOR YOU?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.711
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAS TO LIVE WITH IT.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.747
- NO, IT'S NOT
A PROBLEM FOR ME.
- OKAY.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.582
- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
- YOU KNOW THERE'S OPTIONS.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.985
- HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED PLUGS?
- PLUGS? PLUGS?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.721
- YEAH.
- YOU MENTION PLUGS TO ME?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.924
YOU MENTION--
YOU SIT AT THIS TABLE
AND MENTION PLUGS?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.827
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

08:13.927 --> 08:17.531
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN YOU WHEELED AWAY
FROM THE TABLE THAT--

08:17.631 --> 08:19.332
MM-HMM,
THAT I'M A WHEELIE.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.168
- THAT YOU'RE A WHEELIE.
- RIGHT.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.837
BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S THE PROPER TERM?
CAN I SAY HANDICAPPED?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.606
WHAT IS IT?
ARE YOU DISABLED?
HANDICAPPED?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.374
- WHAT'S THE WORD?
- YEAH, THOSE ARE--

08:27.474 --> 08:30.077
CHALLENGED?
ARE YOU CHALLENGED?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.013
RIGHT NOW I AM, YEAH.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.717
OKAY.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.455
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
- HMM.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.291
WELL, THERE'S YOUR DATE.
THAT'S YOUR DATE.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.126
- THANKS.
- THAT WAS A DATE.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.361
- IT SURE WAS.
- HUH?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.631
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.671
UM, YOU KNOW,

08:57.771 --> 09:00.340
I SHOULD PROBABLY--
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.010
RIGHT.
BECAUSE I'M HANDICAPPED?

09:03.110 --> 09:06.313
WHAT? NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT FOR?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.782
OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THEN WHY?

09:13.754 --> 09:16.323
OKAY, I'LL--

09:16.423 --> 09:18.826
- GREAT

09:18.926 --> 09:20.961
OKAY.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.696
LET'S SEE.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.302
MMM.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.005
OKAY.
OKAY, KEEP GOING.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.742
OH!

09:39.947 --> 09:42.315
( grunts )

09:42.415 --> 09:44.985
OH NO.
OH!

09:50.123 --> 09:52.225
HOW DO--

09:52.325 --> 09:54.361
HOW DO OTHER PEOPLE DO THIS?

09:54.461 --> 09:58.298
WE JUST--
WE GO TO THE BEDROOM.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.701
( clicks tongue )

10:06.139 --> 10:09.342
( drum roll )

10:11.478 --> 10:13.881
( screams )

10:35.335 --> 10:38.105
( panting )

10:38.205 --> 10:41.108
- ANYTHING?
- NO.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.110
HMM.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.278
INTERESTING.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.518
Hey, Larry.
This is John Fowler.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.988
I don't know what happened
on the street yesterday, but--

10:55.088 --> 10:57.224
Jamie:
Is that him?
He's a fucking asshole!

10:57.324 --> 10:59.126
John:
I think it would be
best for everyone

10:59.226 --> 11:01.729
if you didn't come
to the Chee-Yun concert.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.630
Jamie:
I don't want him
anywhere near Kelsey!

11:03.731 --> 11:05.899
John:
Sorry. Bye.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.669
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

11:09.770 --> 11:12.572
YOU GOT IN KIND OF
LATE LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.141
HOW WAS THE DATE WITH
THAT WHEELCHAIR CHICK?

11:14.241 --> 11:16.810
- I DON'T KISS AND TELL.
- COME ON, MAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.412
WELL, I'LL JUST GIVE YOU
THE BARE BONES OF IT, OKAY?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.214
OH SHIT, YOU GAVE
IT TO HER, RIGHT?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.818
YEAH, AND THERE WAS LIKE
NO REACTION AT ALL.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.120
- HMM.
- AND I DON'T KNOW

11:27.220 --> 11:30.290
IF IT'S BECAUSE I WAS
BAD AND DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING,

11:30.390 --> 11:34.694
OR IF IT'S JUST
HER CONDITION.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.430
- DID YOU BRING IT?
- I BROUGHT IT.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.732
- YOU DID YOUR THING?
- YEAH.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.034
- AND NO RESPONSE AT ALL?
- NOTHING.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.936
IF YOU FUCKING BRUNG IT,
IF YOU REALLY FUCKING
BRUNG IT, MAN,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.337
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HER--

11:44.437 --> 11:46.740
COMA, FUCKING HANDICAPPED,
ANY OF THAT SHIT.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.108
I DON'T THINK YOU
FUCKING BRUNG IT.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.277
I'M TELLING YOU I BRUNG IT.
I KNOW WHEN I BRING IT

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
AND I KNOW WHEN I DON'T
BRING IT, AND I BROUGHT IT.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.814
- YOU DID YOUR FUCKING THING?
- YES.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.916
- YOU DID THE DIZZLE
ON HER, RIGHT?
- I DID WHAT?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.717
- THE DIZZLE.
- THE DIZZLE?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.787
YOU DID YOUR DIZZLE
ON HER, RIGHT?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.588
YEAH, I DID MY DIZZLE.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.857
THAT MEANS YOU DID
YOUR FUCKING THING.
NO FUCKING RESPONSE?

12:03.957 --> 12:06.259
- YES.
- BRING THE FUCKING RUCKUS
TO THAT ASS, LARRY.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.261
OH, I SUPPOSED YOU THINK YOU
COULD HAVE GOTTEN A RESPONSE?

12:08.361 --> 12:10.097
- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT, LARRY.
- BULLSHIT.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.365
I WOULD'VE HAD HER
ASS TAP-DANCING, LARRY.
I DON'T FUCK AROUND.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.102
GIVE ME HER GODDAMN NUMBER.
I'LL GO OVER THERE AND TWIST
THAT ASS UP, LARRY.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.970
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU HER NUMBER.
- I'LL BEND THAT BITCH
LIKE BECKHAM.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.338
I'LL HAVE HER ASS
LIKE A GODDAMN PRETZEL.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.707
YOU SHOULD'VE BROKE
THAT ASS IN TWO PIECES.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.010
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
YOU SHOULD'VE CAME BACK WITH
THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE ASS.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.178
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.580
I DON'T REALLY LIKE HER
THAT MUCH BUT SHE CORNERED
ME FOR DINNER.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.150
OH NO, FUCK THAT.
YOU GOT TO BREAK UP
WITH HER ASS.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.019
I'LL HAVE TO DO IT
WHEN I SEE HER.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.454
YOU CAN'T BREAK UP WITH
A HANDICAPPED PERSON
BY PHONE, RIGHT?

12:34.554 --> 12:37.958
NO, HUH-UH.
NO, YOU GOT TO DO
IT FACE TO FACE.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.193
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.668
LOOK AT THIS.
NO SPACES.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.270
I CAN'T FIND
A PARKING SPACE.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.973
JUST PARK IN
THE HANDICAPPED SPOT
IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.574
HANDICAPPED SPOT?
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT?

12:54.674 --> 12:57.177
THIS IS HOW.
LIKE THIS.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.014
OH MY GOD.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.715
WHAT A PARKING SPACE.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.518
HOW ABOUT THIS RAMP?
ARE YOU LOVING THIS RAMP?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.120
- ( laughs )
- A RAMP.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.893
OH CHRIST.
WE DON'T HAVE A RESERVATION.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.062
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.504
HI. I'M SORRY, IT'S GONNA
BE ABOUT 45 MINUTES.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.508

13:28.608 --> 13:31.444

13:47.861 --> 13:50.797
AND WE'RE GONNA START YOU
OFF WITH A COUPLE OF GLASSES
OF CHAMPAGNE.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.265
- ISN'T THAT SWEET?
- COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.868
- SERIOUSLY?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.604
- YOU DO THIS FOR EVERYONE?
- NO, WE DON'T.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.941
THANKS SO MUCH.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.410
- THAT'S NICE.
- WOW.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.546
SO WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

14:09.282 --> 14:12.052
YOU KNOW, THAT PAIN
IN MY LEG WENT AWAY.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.387
OH, GOOD.
GREAT.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.023
- WELL, I'M GLAD.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.291

14:20.860 --> 14:22.395

14:22.495 --> 14:25.732

BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM.
I AM STUFFED.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.742
I'M KINDA FULL MYSELF.
I DON'T THINK I'M REALLY
IN THE MOOD FOR THAT.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.411
NO PROBLEM, SURE.
I'LL JUST GET THIS
OUT OF THE WAY FOR YOU

14:38.511 --> 14:41.448

14:41.548 --> 14:42.950

14:51.358 --> 14:53.860
THANK YOU.
THIS IS DENISE,
BY THE WAY, TED.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.563

YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.
IT IS THE BEST PIECE OF PIE
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.848
HONESTLY, I'M REALLY--
I'M NOT EATING
DESSERT ANYMORE.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.750
JUST HAVE ONE BITE.
HAVE A BITE, COME ON.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.252
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD, TED.
I DON'T WANT IT.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.420
THANK YOU.
IT'S A NICE GESTURE.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.822
YOU'RE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.391
I HAD THE OPTION
OF ORDERING DESSERT

15:24.491 --> 15:26.493
AND I DIDN'T WANT
THE DESSERT AT THE TIME.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.029
- SO I DON'T WANT THE DESSERT.
- JUST HAVE ONE LITTLE BITE.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.763

PLEASE, BE A FRIEND.
- I DON'T CARE.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.066
- BE A FUCKING FRIEND,
WILL YOU PLEASE?
- I AM A FRIEND.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.835
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A BITE
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.371
- HAVE A BITE OF THE PIE.

OF THE WAY FOR YOU.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.008

15:44.911 --> 15:47.414
- PUT THE PIE DOWN.
- I'M NOT TAKING A BITE.
I DON'T WANT A BITE.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.516
TAKE THIS FUCKING PIECE OF PIE
AND GET IT OUT OF MY FACE.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.551
- PUT THE FUCKING PIE DOWN!
- DON'T PUT THAT PIE DOWN!

15:51.651 --> 15:54.421
- DO NOT PUT THAT PIE DOWN!
- GOD DAMN IT!

15:54.521 --> 15:57.490
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I HEARD ROSIE O'DONNELL
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.692

15:59.792 --> 16:02.262

GET THIS THING AWAY FROM ME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.536
ROSIE O'DONNELL.
THAT'S BULLSHIT, BY THE WAY.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.571
SHE GOT ME DOWN, YEAH.
OKAY, I ADMIT THAT.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.773
SHE GOT ME DOWN AND I
COULD HAVE REVERSED IT,

16:13.873 --> 16:16.943
BUT IT WAS STOPPED.
PEOPLE INTERFERED.
THAT'S ALL.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.079
HOW DARE YOU GO AROUND
SPREADING THAT RUMOR?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.947
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING WOMEN?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.983
SHE STARTED IT.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.489
OH, WHAT A LOVELY NIGHT
FOR A STROLL AND A ROLL.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.224
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.260
THIS IS SO NICE.
THANK YOU.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.684
- LARRY, I NEVER WOULD HAVE--

16:57.784 --> 17:01.488
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
DISINVITED US TO THE CONCERT.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.257
- CHEE-YUN?
- I TOLD HER ABOUT IT.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.726
- SHE WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
- YEAH, I WAS.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.796
- WE KIND OF
OVERREACTED WITH THAT.
- ABSOLUTELY.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.565
- WE WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU.
- WE MISJUDGED YOU.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.835
- BOTH OF YOU PLEASE COME.
- LET BYGONES-- JUST LET IT GO.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.570
OH, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT THE HELL.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.739
- THERE WE GO.

- YAY YAY.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.474
GOOD FOR US.
LOOK AT US.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.943
WE WILL ABSOLUTELY GIVE YOU
THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE.
NO QUESTION.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.113
OR DO YOU ALREADY HAVE IT?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.580
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- I'M SO SORRY.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.016
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- SHE WAS JUST
OVERCOMPENSATING.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.718
- WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.
- PLEASE.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.553
- I'M EXCITED.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
- OKAY, GREAT.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.089
- SO NICE MEETING YOU.
- THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.058
I'M SO SORRY, LARRY.
WE'LL CALL. OKAY.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.162
I HATE IT AT THE BEACH.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.830
WHO LIKES THE FEELING
OF SAND IN THEIR FEET?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.366
EVEN MORE THAN I HATE THE
FEELING OF SAND IN MY FEET,

17:46.466 --> 17:48.535
I HATE THE FEELING OF SAND
IN MY SNEAKERS.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.703
AND IT LASTS
FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.873
IF YOU WEAR YOUR
SNEAKERS ONCE ON THE BEACH,
YOU NEVER GET IT OUT.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.041
- HEY.
- Jeff: HI.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.377

17:57.477 --> 17:59.379
- JEFF, LET'S TAKE A WALK.
- I'M COMFORTABLE.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.681
- COME ON, IT'S GORGEOUS.
PERFECT WALKING WEATHER.
- IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.151
- IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.018
- PLEASE.
- NO, I'M FINE.

18:06.119 --> 18:09.489
GET UP OFF YOUR FAT ASS
AND LET'S TAKE A WALK!
IT'LL BE ROMANTIC!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.526
- THAT'S NICE.
- DO ME A FAVOR
AND WATCH SAMMI.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.295
- SHE'S GONNA
GO IN THE WATER.
- SURE.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.364
- OKAY, THANKS.
- YEAH, OKAY.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.065
SEE? DON'T YOU
FEEL BETTER NOW?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.401
( Jeff grumbles )

18:23.770 --> 18:26.473
( beeping )

18:29.842 --> 18:33.045
Sammi:

18:48.161 --> 18:51.464

18:51.564 --> 18:52.999
LARRY!

18:53.099 --> 18:55.702

18:59.005 --> 19:01.274
LARRY, HELP!

19:03.676 --> 19:05.945
- OH MY GOD.
- Susie: OH MY GOD, SAMMI!

19:06.045 --> 19:08.248
- GOOD.
- OH MY GOD, SAMMI!

19:08.348 --> 19:11.751
SAMMI, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.086
- WE'VE GOT TO GET HER A TOWEL.
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:14.187 --> 19:16.589
- SHE ALL RIGHT?
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.825
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE WATCHING HER!
- NO NO.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.261
I WAS GOING INTO THE WATER
BUT THEN I REALIZED I HAD
THE BLACKBERRY.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.830
- BLACKBERRY?
GIVE ME THAT.
- WHAT? NO!

19:25.965 --> 19:27.734
( screams )

19:29.236 --> 19:32.672
( groans )

19:32.772 --> 19:35.074
THREW IT RIGHT IN THE WATER.
ALL MY NUMBERS, EVERYTHING.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.809
- GONE?
- YEAH, ALL GONE.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.679
- SUSIE'S A NUT.
- I DON'T HAVE A RECORD
OF ANY OF THOSE.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.415
- I GOT NOTHING IN HERE NOW.
- OH, DENISE CALLED.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.484
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- GIVE HER A CALL.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.319
- SHE LEAVE A NUMBER?
- NO.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.656
DAMN IT.
I DON'T HAVE HER NUMBER
OR HER ADDRESS.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.492
- CALL INFORMATION.
- I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.362
SHE WAS IN MY BLACKBERRY
UNDER DENISE HANDICAP.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.096
THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER
THESE NAMES.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.798
DON'T YOU DO THAT
IN YOUR BLACKBERRY?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.633
YOU PUT NAMES
DOWN WITH JOBS,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.370
SOME ASSOCIATION SO YOU
REMEMBER WHO THEY ARE.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.373
I'VE GOT SHAWN YOGA.
YOU KNOW, THE YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.141
- TERESA MASSEUSE.
- I DO THE SAME THING.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.743
LIKE RIGHT HERE
I GOT-- LOOK LOOK.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.780
NANCY BIG TITS.
I KNOW NANCY'S GOT
BIG ASS TITS.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.250
JONEL SWEET ASS.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW
WHO THE FUCK IT IS.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.185
THAT'S SMART,
YOU KNOW?

20:19.286 --> 20:20.753
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

20:20.853 --> 20:24.257
I CAN'T JUST
VANISH INTO THIN AIR.
THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.360
I MEAN, IMAGINE DOING
THAT WITH A WALKER, OKAY?

20:27.460 --> 20:30.330
WITH A HANDICAPPED WOMAN,
JUST NOT CALL HER LIKE THAT,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.365
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I'LL BE A PARIAH.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.301
IF YOU SAW THE HOUSE,
WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

20:34.401 --> 20:36.503
I THINK SO.
IT WAS AT NIGHT.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.605
LET'S JUST TAKE A DRIVE.
MAYBE WE CAN FIND IT.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.274
- LET'S GO OVER THERE
AND LOOK AROUND.
- COME ON.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.948
I THINK THIS IS IT.
I THINK THIS IS
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.551
- IT LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR.
- ALL THESE HOUSES ARE
THE SAME, MAN.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.854
EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A WHITE
NEIGHBORHOOD EVERYTHING LOOKS
FUCKING NICE AND CLEAN AND SHIT.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.757
WHEN SHIT IS TOO CLEAN
YOU CAN'T FUCKING TELL WHERE
THE FUCK YOU AT.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.859
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IS THAT HER RIGHT THERE?

20:59.959 --> 21:03.763
NO, THAT'S NOT HER.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY MIGHT KNOW EACH OTHER.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.732
- YEAH, IT COULD BE A WHOLE--
- I'M GONNA PULL OVER.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.667
- TWO WOMEN IN A WHEELCHAIR?
- THEY GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.236
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE KNOW OTHER
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE, RIGHT?

21:10.337 --> 21:12.539
YOU WOULD THINK.
IF YOU WERE LIVING IN
AN ALL-WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD

21:12.639 --> 21:14.774
AND THERE WAS A BROTHER,
YOU WOULD KNOW THE
BROTHER, RIGHT?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.876
- I WOULD KNOW THE BROTHER.
I WOULD GO HOLLA AT HIM.
- EXACTLY.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.745
- YOU DON'T MIND ME USING
THE WORD BROTHER, DO YOU?
- NO, BROTHER'S COOL.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.747
- THAT'S PERFECT.
- HOW'D IT SOUND COMING
OUT OF MY MOUTH?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.615
- SOUNDS GREAT
COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
- COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.283
- SOUNDS COOL, YEAH.
- YOU DIDN'T MIND ME SAYING IT?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.386
- NO, FUCK THAT.
- OKAY.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.355
- BROTHER SOUNDS COOL.
- OKAY.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.357
( laughing )
BROTHER.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.759
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S COME DOWN TO.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.461
EXCUSE ME.

21:34.561 --> 21:37.063
I'M LOOKING FOR A WOMAN
NAMED DENISE.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.932
I THINK SHE LIVES
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'M PRETTY SURE.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.802
AND SHE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.637
AH, YEAH.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.607
DENISE AND ME
AND STEPHAN HAWKING,
WE HANG OUT ALL THE TIME,

21:47.707 --> 21:50.309
'CAUSE WE ALL LIVE IN
THE WHEELCHAIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.178
NO, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW YOUR FRIEND.

21:52.278 --> 21:55.214
YOU DON'T KNOW HER?
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
ROLLING AROUND HERE?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.016
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN?
NO?

21:57.116 --> 21:59.786
NO. I'M SO SORRY
THAT I DON'T KNOW
YOUR FRIEND DENISE.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.121
- BUT I'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
- WHERE YOU GOING?

22:02.221 --> 22:04.290
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.225
YOU NEED SOME--
YOU NEED A PUSH?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.727
- NO.
- I'M A GOOD PUSHER.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.962
- YEAH, YOU'RE PUSHY ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, I'M PUSHY.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.331
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- LARRY.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.201
OKAY, LARRY,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

22:15.301 --> 22:18.204
I REALLY WAS ENJOYING
MY DAY UNTIL I MET YOU.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.373
WHAT IS THIS?
WHO ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

22:20.473 --> 22:21.674
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HER.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.176
- HER NAME'S CHEE-YUN.
- HMM.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.713
( doorbell rings )

22:30.216 --> 22:32.619
THANK YOU.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.121
I'M GONNA GO OVER
MY PLAYLIST.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.889
LET US KNOW IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.226
- HI.

22:40.326 --> 22:43.630
- I'M WENDY.
- HI. UM--

22:43.730 --> 22:46.098
JAMIE. THIS IS JAMIE.
I'M JOHN. WELCOME.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.734
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, JAMIE. HI, JOHN.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.403
- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.
- WELCOME TO OUR HOME, LARRY.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.138
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- THANKS FOR BRINGING A FRIEND.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.407
- I BROUGHT MY FRIEND WENDY.
- HUH.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.076
- GREAT.
- THAT'S GREAT.
WELCOME.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.413
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO HEAR CHEE-YUN.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.214
OH HEY, ANY FRIEND
OF LARRY'S...

23:02.314 --> 23:04.350
- THANK YOU.
- ANY FRIEND OF LARRY'S.

23:04.451 --> 23:08.087
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.122
ALL RIGHT.
UM, YEAH.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.059
HOW DID--
HOW DID YOU TWO...

23:13.159 --> 23:15.127
HEY, O'DONNELL.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.129
HEY, LARRY.
HOW ARE YOU?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.665
- WHAT'S THIS?
- WHAT?

23:18.765 --> 23:20.332
YOU'RE GOING AROUND TELLING
EVERYBODY YOU KICKED MY ASS?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.502
- WHAT ABOUT IT?
- YOU DIDN'T KICK MY ASS.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.504
I KEEP HEARING FROM PEOPLE
YOU KICKED MY ASS.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.506
- I MOST CERTAINLY DID, LARRY.
- NO YOU DIDN'T.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.808
IN A VERY CROWDED
RESTAURANT WITH WITNESSES.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.910
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GETTING THAT
INTERPRETATION FROM.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.446
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS MAKE ONE
MORE MOVE AND YOU WERE DEAD.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.181
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY--
ONE MORE MOVE.

23:35.281 --> 23:38.050
IT WAS OVER, LARRY.
I HAD YOU. BOOM BOOM,
YOU WERE DOWN.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.087
- BULLSHIT.
- WHAT CAN I TELL YOU, LARRY?
SOMETIMES YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.088
- OH, I'M AN ASSHOLE?
- YES.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.690
- REALLY?
- YES.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.858
WELL, ASSHOLES DON'T GO OUT
WITH THE DISABLED, OKAY?

23:45.958 --> 23:48.528
CHECK THAT OUT.
YEAH, SHE'S MY DATE.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.862
- THAT GIRL IS YOUR DATE?
- THAT GIRL IS MY DATE.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.430
- IN THE CHAIR?
- IN THE CHAIR.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.500
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:
SHE'S NOT MY FIRST.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.267
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I DATE THE DISABLED.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.203
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU
GOT ME ON THAT ONE.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.706
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT
AN ASSHOLE WHEN IT COMES
TO CHECKS AT RESTAURANTS.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.274
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:
THAT WAS MY CHECK, OKAY?
I INVITED YOU.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.576
YOU WERE MY GUEST.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.844
THAT IS BULLSHIT.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.513
- MY PLEASURE, ROSIE.
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.549
LISTEN, WHO GOT THE BILL?
I GOT THE BILL AT THE END.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.618
BOTTOM LINE.
AND YOU WANT TO
KNOW SOMETHING?

24:11.718 --> 24:13.553
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING NEXT WEEK?
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING NEXT WEEK?

24:13.653 --> 24:15.755
I'M RENTING A YACHT
AND I'M CALLING ALL
OUR FRIENDS

24:15.855 --> 24:17.624
AND WE'RE TAKING
A YACHT TO CATALINA.
AND YOU'RE COMING.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.493
AND I'M FOOTING THE WHOLE
FREAKING BILL.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.094
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?
I'M CALLING YOUR FAMILY,

24:22.194 --> 24:24.163
I'M FLYING THEM OUT HERE
FIRST CLASS ON A JET,

24:24.263 --> 24:26.298
PUTTING THEM UP IN
A HOTEL, TAKING THEM OUT
TO DINNER AND YOU.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.267
- YEAH YEAH.
- OH REALLY? HOW ABOUT THIS?

24:28.367 --> 24:31.571
- ( bell rings )
- WE ARE GOING TO GET STARTED
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

24:31.671 --> 24:35.141
- PLEASE START TO MAKE YOUR WAY
INTO THE PERFORMANCE AREA.
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.943
WHEN THIS IS OVER,
YOU MEET ME IN
THE PARKING LOT.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.444
- WE'LL PICK THIS UP.
- PARKING LOT.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.979
- YEAH, WE'LL PICK IT UP.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.915
- O'DONNELL TWISTED MY ARM.
- SHE TWISTED YOUR ARM?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.851
YEAH, TELLING EVERYBODY
THAT SHE KICKED MY ASS.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.986
SHE DIDN'T KICK MY ASS.
YOU THINK SHE KICKED MY ASS?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.155
- YOU WERE THERE.
- I'D STOP MESSING WITH HER.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.357
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

24:51.457 --> 24:53.425
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
WITH DENISE?

24:53.526 --> 24:56.596
WELL, SUSIE THREW MY
BLACKBERRY INTO THE OCEAN

24:56.696 --> 24:58.097
SO I DIDN'T HAVE
DENISE'S NUMBER.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.666
THEN I WENT LOOKING FOR HER
AND I MET WENDY.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.834
WENDY?
WHO'S WENDY?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.805
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
DENISE IS HERE?

25:05.905 --> 25:08.941
WHAT?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.943
FUCK.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.548
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
ALL THESE WHEELCHAIR GIRLS.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.584
I MET HER WHEN
I WAS LOOKING FOR HER.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.286
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.288
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.423
UM, ENJOY.
SEE YOU LATER.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.258
WOW.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.828
- LARRY, WE SHOULD GO IN.
- YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

25:28.928 --> 25:30.462
( laughs )
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.665
OF COURSE I WANT TO DO THIS.
SHE'S MY FAVORITE.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.400
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.903
UH...

25:39.606 --> 25:41.473
- JUST ONE SECOND.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:41.574 --> 25:43.375
ONE SECOND.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN ONE SECOND.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.544
WHAT? LARRY, WHAT
THE HELL IS THIS?

25:45.645 --> 25:48.247
- IT'S A JOKE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- LARRY.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.516
- HEY.
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

25:50.617 --> 25:52.451
WHERE WERE YOU?
I WAITED AND WAITED.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.020
FINALLY I CALLED
INFORMATION

25:54.120 --> 25:56.188
AND GOT
THE FOWLER'S NUMBER.
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:56.288 --> 25:58.825
SOMEBODY THREW MY BLACKBERRY
IN THE OCEAN SO I DIDN'T
HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.393
- I COULDN'T GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU.
- REALLY?

26:01.493 --> 26:03.429
- YEAH.
- ( phone ringing )

26:03.529 --> 26:05.397
WHAT'S THAT RINGING?

26:05.497 --> 26:07.299
OH, I GOT A NEW BLACKBERRY.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.201
- OH, A NEW ONE.
- YEAH.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.138
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD TURN IT OFF?
- I BETTER TURN THIS OFF.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.741
- OH!
- GOD.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.847
WENDY WHEELCHAIR?

26:23.883 --> 26:25.451
HELLO?

26:25.551 --> 26:27.620
WHAT?

26:27.720 --> 26:31.157
- YOU'RE IN THE CLOSET?
- ( pounding )

26:33.225 --> 26:35.695
HANG ON.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.732
UH...

26:47.506 --> 26:49.175
WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.177
WENDY WHEELCHAIR.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.112
WHO IS SHE?

26:53.212 --> 26:57.650
DENISE HANDICAP.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.320
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.
- PRICK.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.555
- HOW DARE YOU!?
- OH!

27:03.656 --> 27:06.859
( playing classical music )

27:06.959 --> 27:09.796
( shouting, clamoring )

27:13.532 --> 27:15.935
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.737
- ( glass breaks )
- Denise: BASTARD.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.539
- GET OVER HERE.
- LARRY, GET BACK HERE.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.308
- YOU COWARD.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

27:22.408 --> 27:25.577
- RUNNING UP THE STAIRS.
- IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.413
WE MAY BE DISABLED,
BUT YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

27:27.513 --> 27:30.216
LADIES LADIES,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.218
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.753
GET BACK HERE, LARRY.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.522
YOU GET BACK HERE!

27:36.622 --> 27:38.825
- ( bodies crash )
- ( Larry groans )

27:38.925 --> 27:42.094
( theme music playing )
