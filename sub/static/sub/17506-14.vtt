WEBVTT

00:01.176 --> 00:04.573
And this is little nudge
academy's nap room.

00:04.698 --> 00:06.128
Donated by the CFO of Disney.

00:06.253 --> 00:07.087
I read about this online.

00:07.212 --> 00:08.893
The entire floor
is tempur-pedic, honey.

00:09.018 --> 00:10.218
Look at this.

00:10.384 --> 00:11.936
Oh, wow.

00:12.061 --> 00:15.015
Oh, yes.
Honey, you got to get in here.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.584
I swear, you could put
a couple glasses of red wine

00:16.709 --> 00:19.561
on here and jump up and down,
and it wouldn't spill at all.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.765
Not that we've tested that.
It's...

00:20.890 --> 00:24.316
We don't drink in bed.
Or ever.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.376
Well, we find that a good nap

00:25.501 --> 00:27.069
primes our students
for analytic learning.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.453
Analytical... okay, well
our daughter, like,

00:29.578 --> 00:31.281
zero years old.

00:31.447 --> 00:32.661
Well, you're smart
to vet schools now.

00:32.786 --> 00:34.993
Little nudge's waiting list
is two years long.

00:35.159 --> 00:36.119
Wow.

00:36.285 --> 00:37.204
Well, let me show you our music room.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.164
- We just got a new Steinway.
- Oh.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.283
Babe, don't you think
we should just send her

00:41.408 --> 00:43.053
to the pre-school
that's near our house.

00:43.178 --> 00:44.127
I mean, it's nice and normal.

00:44.293 --> 00:45.837
Little nudge is the best, honey.

00:46.003 --> 00:46.713
Our methods work.

00:47.076 --> 00:49.631
The data show that
72% of our students

00:49.756 --> 00:51.510
graduate from Ivy league colleges.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.374
Ivy league, Chris.

00:53.499 --> 00:55.111
Oh, my God, yeah.
Can picture Amy at Harvard, huh?

00:55.236 --> 00:56.213
Yeah.

00:56.338 --> 00:58.751
Fall foliage, and just rowing crew

00:58.876 --> 01:00.652
and dating a vice president's son.

01:00.777 --> 01:01.820
But chaste.
I mean, none of the...

01:01.945 --> 01:02.955
What can we do to make sure

01:03.080 --> 01:04.480
that our daughter
gets into this school?

01:04.647 --> 01:06.762
Well, there are many factors
involved in the process.

01:06.887 --> 01:07.943
A child's aptitude.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.112
- Off the charts.
- Their acclimation to others.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.947
- She has a very social gaze.
- Yeah.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.073
Multilingual exposure.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.343
<i>Podemos hablar poquito.</i>

01:15.468 --> 01:16.952
<i>Oui, oui, madame.</i>

01:17.118 --> 01:18.882
And of course there's
parental involvement,

01:19.007 --> 01:21.623
donating time or sourcing
financial support.

01:21.789 --> 01:24.057
We have a charity auction
every year, and unfortunately

01:24.182 --> 01:26.670
the parent who is leading it
had to drop out.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.380
I'll do it!
I'll run the auction.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.066
Whoa.
Babe, I don't know if...

01:30.191 --> 01:32.871
I produce 120 hours
of TV a year, honey.

01:32.996 --> 01:34.803
I think I can produce
a charity auction.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.848
I'll go grab some info,
and you can commence promptly.

01:38.127 --> 01:39.938
Oh.
"Commence promptly."

01:40.214 --> 01:41.852
Way to not split the infinitive.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.021
- Did I just split the infinitive?
- I don't know what that is.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.001
You will donate a weekend
at canyon ranch?

02:05.126 --> 02:08.377
Great. But there's got to be
a spa package in there, okay?

02:08.544 --> 02:11.245
Oh, thank you.
Boom!

02:11.370 --> 02:13.925
I'm sorry. I, uh,
should have hung up first.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.618
But I did mean "boom."

02:15.743 --> 02:17.804
Yeah, all right.
Thank you so much.

02:17.970 --> 02:18.923
All right, babe, I'm going
to go pick up Casey

02:19.048 --> 02:20.140
from the airport.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.696
Were you just lifting weights so that
you would look strong for your brother?

02:23.821 --> 02:24.770
No.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.967
Yes, you did.

02:27.092 --> 02:28.482
You just yoked up.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.026
You're yoked, look at that.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.208
Every time your brother come to town,

02:32.333 --> 02:33.653
you got to butch yourself up.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.405
No, I don't.

02:35.571 --> 02:36.581
Yes, you do.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.515
You strut around with
your chest all puffed up

02:38.640 --> 02:40.285
and those, like, "what are
you looking at?" Arms.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.282
Don't be threatened
by my masculinity.

02:42.407 --> 02:44.039
It only exists to love and protect.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.853
Sweetie, I love Casey.

02:45.978 --> 02:47.823
But this never-ending one-upping,

02:47.948 --> 02:49.211
it's like you're teenagers.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.754
It just would be nice
if your relationship

02:50.920 --> 02:53.590
would mature past a push-up contest.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.675
He wins because his form is bad.

02:55.841 --> 02:57.070
You haven't seen him in a year,

02:57.195 --> 02:58.178
and you could be closer.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.458
Yeah, I would like
the dynamic to change.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.361
And I think that I'm a new man.

03:02.486 --> 03:05.060
I put the law firm madness behind me,

03:05.226 --> 03:07.201
and I love being a stay-at-home dad.

03:07.326 --> 03:08.855
And I'm very comfortable
in my own skin.

03:09.021 --> 03:11.525
Are you wearing cologne?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.140
It's bear musk.

03:13.265 --> 03:15.465
Put it on before the conversation.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.706
- Hello.
- Good morning!

03:17.831 --> 03:19.174
Good morning.
Ah, thank you.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.309
More auction items came in.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.310
Oh, wonder...

03:21.435 --> 03:22.920
Oh, look at this.

03:23.045 --> 03:25.048
I had to pull a few favors
to get this stuff overnighted.

03:25.173 --> 03:27.207
But no big deal,
just an auction genius.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.722
All right, let's see
what we've got here.

03:29.847 --> 03:30.710
My goodness.

03:30.876 --> 03:33.393
Ah, a Tiffany keychain.
Check.

03:33.518 --> 03:34.661
Thank you, Missy, so much.

03:34.786 --> 03:35.674
I couldn't have done any
of this without you.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.010
I would do anything to
help Amy get a good education.

03:39.176 --> 03:40.800
I mean, Oakland public schools
made me tough as nails,

03:40.925 --> 03:43.169
but that had consequences.

03:43.294 --> 03:44.736
Don't walk up on me!

03:44.861 --> 03:45.934
It's a friend.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.185
Sorry.

03:47.351 --> 03:49.640
Hey, h

03:49.765 --> 03:50.689
what's all this?

03:50.855 --> 03:53.477
Uh, we are hosting a charity auction

03:53.602 --> 03:54.985
for Amy's future preschool.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.779
- Oh.
- And the <i>coup de grace...</i>

03:57.945 --> 04:01.491
- Yes?
- You are the MC!

04:04.276 --> 04:06.496
Yay.

04:06.662 --> 04:08.498
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I don't do auctions.

04:09.243 --> 04:11.835
They give me agita.
I'll write a check instead.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.826
No, no.
We need you, not your money.

04:14.951 --> 04:16.827
Come on, this is for
a very good cause,

04:16.952 --> 04:20.510
I.E., getting her into a school
with a petting zoo.

04:20.676 --> 04:22.304
- I hate speaking fast.
- You used to rap.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.221
The room's always too hot.

04:23.387 --> 04:24.968
You endorse a line of space heaters.

04:25.093 --> 04:26.302
I don't like to be on
when I'm away from my set.

04:26.427 --> 04:27.684
You give away headshots to strangers.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.104
And anyway, Kevin and I
are taking my boat

04:29.229 --> 04:30.437
to Catalina Island that morning.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.647
I thought you were
selling the <i>super freak 2?</i>

04:32.813 --> 04:35.210
It's tough to move
a psychedelic houseboat

04:35.335 --> 04:37.360
in this market.

04:37.526 --> 04:38.813
When you get to Kuala Lumpur,

04:38.938 --> 04:41.031
Casey.
Casey.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.284
When you get there,
you tell Tengku Casey sent you.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.986
Okay?
Wow, you're so pretty.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.078
Look at you go.

04:47.244 --> 04:49.748
Dude, what a classic.

04:51.315 --> 04:52.292
Whoa, hey.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.294
Your shoulders,
they feel a little thin.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.462
You stop working out on me?

04:55.628 --> 04:56.671
Come on, man.
No, I'm working out

04:56.837 --> 04:58.263
at the gym everyday.

04:58.388 --> 04:59.466
Plus I'm supplementing with p90x.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.132
You got to upgrade to insanity.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.867
It's a total body experience.

05:02.992 --> 05:05.736
I could leap from here
on top of that ATM, no problem.

05:05.861 --> 05:07.638
Come on, man.
Give me a hug, bro.

05:07.763 --> 05:09.059
Get in here, little brother.

05:11.566 --> 05:12.896
Argh!

05:13.062 --> 05:13.855
Wow, that the best you got?

05:14.021 --> 05:15.022
- Yeah.
- Uhh!

05:17.838 --> 05:20.362
Bro, what's up with
all this pop-country, huh?

05:20.528 --> 05:23.651
Oh, yeah.
No, Reagan must've gotten

05:23.776 --> 05:25.019
her hands on my radio.

05:25.144 --> 05:26.826
I do not listen to lady antebellum.

05:26.992 --> 05:29.990
Yeah.

05:30.115 --> 05:31.373
It's great to see you, Casey.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.759
You too, brother.

05:32.884 --> 05:34.494
I'm so excited for you
to meet your niece, Amy.

05:34.619 --> 05:35.828
Oh, man, me too.

05:35.953 --> 05:37.763
I've just been so swamped
travelling for work.

05:37.888 --> 05:39.465
These global markets,
they never close, bro.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.532
You know? Ever.

05:40.657 --> 05:41.675
Global markets.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.268
Man, you are killing it, huh?

05:43.393 --> 05:44.719
- Eh.
- Oh, what am I talking about?

05:44.885 --> 05:46.096
You were always killing it.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.139
So, uh, how's work going?

05:48.305 --> 05:49.073
What's that?

05:49.198 --> 05:50.350
Well, the last time we talked,

05:50.516 --> 05:52.842
you were on track to be partner.

05:52.967 --> 05:56.314
Yeah, you know, actually, um...

05:56.480 --> 05:59.901
Oh.
I'm sorry, you didn't make it?

06:00.067 --> 06:01.653
Hey, look, brother.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.655
Don't feel bad, right?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.885
No, dude, I'm...
I'm killing it, yeah.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.117
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.487
Yeah, taking care of business, bro.

06:08.612 --> 06:10.021
- All right.
- T.C.B.

06:10.146 --> 06:11.705
Yeah, t.C.B.
That's my little brother, huh?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.373
Yeah, crazy billable hours.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.419
Hell yeah!
My boy, my boy.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.129
Whoa!

06:19.295 --> 06:21.730
What is that?

06:21.855 --> 06:23.498
Yeah.
I know.

06:23.623 --> 06:25.300
You and Reagan, you guys
getting a little kinky,

06:25.425 --> 06:26.834
a little freaky?
Huh?

06:26.959 --> 06:28.930
No, no, no, that's uh...
It's a baby Bjorn, man.

06:29.096 --> 06:29.802
Huh?

06:29.927 --> 06:32.004
No, it's just to
carry my baby, my child.

06:32.129 --> 06:33.371
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, no.

06:33.496 --> 06:34.572
Oh, man, I'm sorry about that.

06:34.697 --> 06:38.779
Don't worry about it, dude, that's...

06:38.904 --> 06:40.400
So you're killing it
at work, right?

06:40.566 --> 06:41.617
- Yeah.
- Right, right, right.

06:41.742 --> 06:42.684
Just laying waste, dude.

06:42.809 --> 06:44.571
- Yeah, man.
- Ohh.

06:46.679 --> 06:49.034
Hey, do you have time for a visitor?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.190
I'm pretty busy.

06:51.315 --> 06:52.858
There's a Raquel Welch
crystal light commercial

06:52.983 --> 06:55.373
from the '80s that I have to see.

06:55.539 --> 06:58.029
Wow, maybe you could teach
this visitor about the Internet.

06:58.154 --> 06:59.336
Oh, my God.
Reagan.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.697
The little nudge academy

07:00.822 --> 07:02.265
would have taught her about that,

07:02.390 --> 07:04.257
but she doesn't get
to go there now, so...

07:04.423 --> 07:06.467
Auntie Ava, you may have

07:06.592 --> 07:09.888
stunted my development,
but I know you still love me.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.371
You think a creepy baby voice

07:11.496 --> 07:13.142
and a grim hypothetical
will get me to your auction?

07:13.267 --> 07:14.184
Think again.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.064
Oh, did not know
Amy was going to get involved.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.774
That coo is my kryptonite.
Keep her back!

07:20.940 --> 07:21.953
Oh, no.

07:22.078 --> 07:23.818
I love you.
You're so pretty.

07:23.984 --> 07:25.195
What's this.
What's that?

07:25.361 --> 07:26.196
I'm gonna get you.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.697
Pick and roll!

07:29.417 --> 07:32.153
Ohh, you are ruthless.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.997
And so are you, Reagan.

07:34.122 --> 07:35.413
All right, I'll do your auction.

07:35.579 --> 07:38.034
I didn't even have
to bring out the big guns.

07:38.159 --> 07:39.626
- Lethal cuteness.
- What?

07:39.792 --> 07:42.712
You will stop at nothing.
Put those on her right now.

07:49.371 --> 07:50.678
Dude, I can't believe you sent this.

07:50.844 --> 07:52.950
You did not need to get her
such an expensive gift.

07:53.075 --> 07:54.682
Hey, nothing but the best
for my little niece.

07:54.951 --> 07:56.768
It's crazy, you did this.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.561
- It's a miracle.
- Oh, you know what?

07:58.727 --> 08:00.086
While I'm down here,

08:00.211 --> 08:01.815
I think I might just
bang out a quick set.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.756
One, two...

08:03.881 --> 08:04.818
Let me get in on that, bro.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.158
Three, four, got to keep up.

08:06.283 --> 08:07.492
Start again.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.094
- Five, six...
- Dude, those don't count.

08:09.219 --> 08:10.782
- No.
- It's marine style.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.096
I'm counting them.

08:12.221 --> 08:13.868
- Pass on the way down.
- 15, 16...

08:14.034 --> 08:14.965
Down and top.

08:15.090 --> 08:16.037
Hey, guys.

08:16.203 --> 08:17.001
Hey, babe, look who I found.

08:17.126 --> 08:18.415
- Hey.
- I'm watching you.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.637
Hey, so it's been...
Oh, hi, yeah, it's been...

08:20.762 --> 08:22.071
Dude I just did like
four while you were there.

08:22.196 --> 08:23.805
So long since I've...
Since I've seen you.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.573
Dude, you were holding it down low.

08:25.698 --> 08:26.673
- Yeah?
- All righty.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.091
Dude, my heart rate we down.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.143
Really? Because I think you're gonna

08:29.268 --> 08:30.343
have a heart attack any second now.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.679
See that right there?

08:31.804 --> 08:33.347
Welcome to the rest
of your life, honey.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.982
- Switch hands.
- All right.

08:35.107 --> 08:37.518
What you're about to enjoy
is a brassy little Pinot

08:37.643 --> 08:39.894
from the Russian River Valley
in Sonoma.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.480
Pairs well with lamb and family.

08:42.645 --> 08:43.898
Hmm.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.191
I'm sorry, it might be just
me, but it feels like

08:45.316 --> 08:46.993
this needs to, like, breathe,
or it hasn't really

08:47.118 --> 08:48.661
opened yet or something, right?

08:48.786 --> 08:51.129
Reagan, I can't believe you
had a baby, look at you.

08:51.254 --> 08:52.782
If I was a chick, I would hate you.

08:52.948 --> 08:53.950
Oh, God, no.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.400
So, Casey...
What do you think about

08:56.525 --> 08:59.501
Chris's new life change, huh?

08:59.626 --> 09:00.569
Big ol' life change.

09:00.694 --> 09:03.104
About the, um...
The baby. Huh?

09:03.229 --> 09:04.439
What does that...

09:04.710 --> 09:05.712
No, I'm talking about
the fact that you...

09:05.878 --> 09:07.380
The fact that we had the baby.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.923
Yes, with the...

09:09.089 --> 09:10.967
I'm sorry.
Work is blowing up, oh, man.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.146
The yen is punching
the euro in the balls.

09:13.271 --> 09:14.637
Oh, man.
That's not good.

09:15.517 --> 09:18.266
What's...
What's with the... and the blah.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.418
He thinks that I'm still working,

09:21.543 --> 09:23.313
and that, also, I might be a partner.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.274
Oh, my...
What is wrong with you?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.924
He just assumed that I was
still there, all right.

09:28.049 --> 09:29.125
And we started talking
about killing it

09:29.250 --> 09:30.570
and it all got away from me.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.494
This is such teenage crap.
You know that, right?

09:33.619 --> 09:35.730
You too are grown men, okay?

09:35.855 --> 09:38.031
I mean, you've had sex with ladies.

09:38.156 --> 09:39.370
With hot ladies.

09:39.536 --> 09:40.967
You're talking about you, right?

09:41.092 --> 09:42.123
Calm it down.

09:42.289 --> 09:43.271
Now, is this the kind of relationship

09:43.396 --> 09:44.839
- that you want to have with him?
- No, it's not.

09:44.964 --> 09:46.508
But it's the relationship
that we've always had.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.046
He'd go out for basketball,
I'd go out for basketball.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.339
He became a wall street star,

09:49.505 --> 09:50.944
I became a big shot lawyer,

09:51.069 --> 09:53.013
who's like a top-of-his-field guy,

09:53.138 --> 09:55.011
- sort of a hero in the eyes of many.
- Huh?

09:55.639 --> 09:57.449
Look, the point is
that we feed off each other.

09:57.574 --> 09:59.518
You know, yeah, of course
I wish we were closer,

09:59.643 --> 10:00.886
we're just not.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.977
Well, you have to start
by being honest with him.

10:03.143 --> 10:04.555
I haven't found the right moment yet,

10:04.680 --> 10:06.231
he's really pushing my buttons, okay?

10:06.397 --> 10:09.592
Hey, case, buddy,
could I talk to you for a sec?

10:09.717 --> 10:12.028
Actually, you know what?
I got to talk to you about something.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.238
Look what I found
in our mother's storage unit,

10:13.588 --> 10:14.698
scanned for your viewing pleasure.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.866
- Come on, man.
- What is it?

10:17.032 --> 10:18.701
You remember when
you were a tween model?

10:18.826 --> 10:21.120
- Oh, my God.
- No, it gets better, watch.

10:21.286 --> 10:23.915
Check out these husky photos.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.273
Okay, well, husky's a reference

10:25.398 --> 10:26.540
to the brand name, not my...

10:26.665 --> 10:28.795
No, no, no.
You modeled big boy clothes.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.214
Let me see.
Oh, my God.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.258
Honey, you're wearing a bib overall.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.244
Well, it was a little...

10:34.369 --> 10:36.427
Look at him doing the model eyes.

10:37.672 --> 10:39.282
By the way,
my face just looks like this.

10:39.407 --> 10:40.682
All right?
That's not...

10:40.848 --> 10:41.884
And by the way, I'll have you know

10:42.009 --> 10:43.352
that I took the cash from this

10:43.477 --> 10:45.478
and I bought a super rad
motocross bike.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.422
Should have bought a treadmill
is what he should have done.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.657
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.025
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to hit the sack.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.894
Because, I have big day
tomorrow and I don't want

10:55.019 --> 10:56.730
to crash and burn
in front of the partners,

10:56.855 --> 10:59.033
of which, I am one.

10:59.199 --> 11:01.368
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:01.493 --> 11:02.662
Send those to me right now.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.970
I flew all the way out here,
I needed this.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.039
It was supposed to be a sure thing.

11:07.164 --> 11:08.940
Okay, okay.
All right, a right.

11:09.065 --> 11:11.879
Just... just call me
if anything opens up

11:12.045 --> 11:14.048
on the Nikkei stock exchange.

11:14.214 --> 11:16.301
Right, yeah, yeah.
Okay, thank you very much.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.137
Alright, <i>sayonara.</i>
Okay, bye-bye.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.148
Sorry, case.
I just needed to come out

11:20.273 --> 11:21.931
and get her toys and stuff.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.084
Oh, no, no, it's okay.
I'm just doing deals, right?

11:24.209 --> 11:25.386
Yeah.

11:25.511 --> 11:27.937
Okay, what's wrong?
Something's off.

11:28.103 --> 11:30.992
What? No, nothing's off.
It's all good, Reagan.

11:31.117 --> 11:34.593
Oh, come on.
You're all riled up.

11:34.718 --> 11:36.070
Your hair is kind of scraggly.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.096
And honestly,
you usually smell pretty good,

11:38.221 --> 11:42.035
but that cologne, Casey,
it's...

11:42.201 --> 11:46.902
That's designer imposter, isn't it?

11:47.027 --> 11:48.166
It's red suede for men.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.500
Oh, boy.

11:49.666 --> 11:50.738
I saw it by the counter
at the rite-aid

11:50.863 --> 11:52.806
when I was buying a box fan.

11:52.931 --> 11:56.841
For legal reasons, they had
to spell suede with a "w."

11:57.007 --> 12:00.803
I-I lost my job a year ago.

12:00.969 --> 12:03.765
Casey, I'm so sorry.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.052
I came out here for a job interview,

12:05.177 --> 12:06.353
and it fell through.

12:06.478 --> 12:08.789
And now my Tampa-based
headhunter is wondering

12:08.914 --> 12:10.690
why I just said,
<i>"sayonara,"</i> you know?

12:10.815 --> 12:13.459
I mean, Chucky just must
think I'm losing it.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.628
Your headhunter's name is Chucky?

12:15.753 --> 12:18.630
Not like, "Chuck" or "Charles"
or anything?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.783
No, Chucky sounds...
Chucky sounds young and hungry.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.787
Reagan, just... please, please
don't tell Chris about this.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.038
I won't.

12:28.163 --> 12:29.373
But you know what?
You should.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.700
Casey, he loves you so much.

12:33.293 --> 12:35.380
No matter what, he wants
to hr about your life.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.682
No, I... I can't.

12:38.807 --> 12:40.216
I mean, if... if Chris
thinks I'm a loser,

12:40.341 --> 12:42.053
then I don't even know who I am.

12:44.311 --> 12:45.848
Oh, Casey.

12:46.014 --> 12:47.856
No, no, no, it's the red suede.

12:47.981 --> 12:49.157
It's just burning my eyes.

12:49.282 --> 12:50.853
- Oh, gosh.
- It's like Tabasco.

12:51.019 --> 12:52.980
That's gotta smart.

12:56.089 --> 12:57.944
This place is so nice.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.195
I know, right?

12:59.361 --> 13:00.405
Where are the metal detectors?

13:00.859 --> 13:02.407
It's a pre-school.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.369
Things were different in Oakland.

13:04.494 --> 13:06.471
You know the saying,
"youngs be strapped

13:06.596 --> 13:08.905
with the sharpest shivs"?

13:09.030 --> 13:11.416
Did they need a metal
detector for you, Missy?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.932
Guess we should start
putting some bids in, huh?

13:14.057 --> 13:15.967
Kind of had my eye on this
guitar lessons from

13:16.092 --> 13:19.340
Poison's C. C. Deville.
Thinking about--

13:19.506 --> 13:21.137
actually, I'm buying you
guitar lessons

13:21.262 --> 13:23.010
om Poison's C. C. Deville.

13:23.364 --> 13:24.640
There you go, how's that?

13:24.765 --> 13:26.175
All right, yeah.
No problem.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.709
I'll just jump in there myself.

13:27.834 --> 13:29.600
Maybe I'll do... that.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.045
You're going to call it now.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.437
I'm gonna add two zeros.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.614
How's that?

13:33.739 --> 13:35.548
Bam, no problem that's all right.

13:35.673 --> 13:36.983
I just made a slight error.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.193
Move the decimal and add a zero.

13:39.359 --> 13:40.752
How about that?

13:40.877 --> 13:42.021
- Do you mind if...
- Not going to happen, man.

13:42.146 --> 13:43.322
We're kind of
in the middle of something.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.124
This is the closest
you're getting to C. C.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.425
And his north Hollywood studio.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.619
Yeah.
Biddings are closed, so...

13:49.886 --> 13:53.791
Oh, here she is.

13:53.957 --> 13:55.900
She's even more commanding in person.

13:56.025 --> 13:57.526
Uh-huh. Yeah.

14:01.197 --> 14:02.550
- Uh, you okay?
- This keeps happening.

14:03.111 --> 14:04.635
- What?
- You know what they say.

14:04.801 --> 14:07.778
Pashmina caught in a door
twice, shame on me.

14:07.903 --> 14:08.973
Okay, here we go.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.517
Just open the door,
that all you got to do.

14:11.683 --> 14:14.020
- Okay.
- Thank you.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.605
Honey, have you been drinking?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.690
I've been boating all day,
these are sea legs.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.775
Okay, your breath smells of alcohol.

14:19.941 --> 14:21.903
Well, of course I had a boat drink.

14:22.069 --> 14:22.904
A boat drink?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.926
One small rum concoction,

14:25.051 --> 14:27.631
served in a plastic sand bucket.

14:27.756 --> 14:29.452
It was to loosen up
my auction tongue.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.201
What's this?

14:31.326 --> 14:34.040
well, of course I had a limo drink.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.541
Okay, not every vehicle
has to to have a drink.

14:35.707 --> 14:39.208
I am fine.
Fine.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.933
Wow, great.

14:43.221 --> 14:46.302
Do I have 500?
Let me see 500.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.637
Five, five.
Thank you, sir.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.850
That's our jive,
look alive, feeling live.

14:49.975 --> 14:52.225
Let's look at 750.
750, 750.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.921
Hi, hi.

14:55.046 --> 14:58.223
I saw you come in with the Benz
with really nice rims.

14:58.348 --> 15:01.559
Why don't you get the paddle up?
Okay? Thank you.

15:01.684 --> 15:03.069
Thank you sir, that feels great.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.324
What you say, sir?
Better get off your butt.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.798
Better get off your butt.

15:09.923 --> 15:10.868
If you know what,
you better get off your butt.

15:11.091 --> 15:12.267
It's almost ten.

15:12.392 --> 15:13.663
That's a ten!
Let me say it again,

15:13.829 --> 15:15.970
that's a ten...
Going once, going twice.

15:16.095 --> 15:18.840
Hot diggity doggity,
millity vanillity,

15:18.965 --> 15:20.874
sold to the guy in the suspenders.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.442
Thank you, Missy.

15:22.567 --> 15:26.779
Moving on to lot 44,
an Australian surf vacation.

15:26.904 --> 15:29.345
We are very close to our goal,

15:29.511 --> 15:33.599
so let's start the bidding at $3,500.

15:33.765 --> 15:36.156
Man, I've always wanted
to go surfing in Australia.

15:36.281 --> 15:37.603
I heard the waves break
the other way down there.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.981
Ah, carving it up down under is wild.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.691
Well, I do have some
vacation days coming.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.317
I got a huge bonus on the way.

15:43.483 --> 15:44.652
3,500!

15:44.818 --> 15:45.695
That's it, 3,500.
There we go.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.233
Four large!

15:47.358 --> 15:49.448
- 4,100 large.
- 4,500.

15:49.614 --> 15:50.825
Everything okay for you with...

15:50.991 --> 15:52.410
Oh, it's fabulous.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.172
I'm just happy to help, really.

15:55.297 --> 15:57.641
Amy and I, we're...
I think we just have

15:57.766 --> 15:59.058
- the same gene.
- Oh yeah.

15:59.183 --> 16:00.459
- You know, we're doers.
- Uh-huh.

16:00.968 --> 16:03.211
A lot of babies, they
look at the world like,

16:03.336 --> 16:05.172
"hey, whatever, world."
But not Amy. She's like,

16:05.338 --> 16:07.675
"what's up?
How can I help you?"

16:07.841 --> 16:09.635
Mm-mm.
And Ava is amazing.

16:09.801 --> 16:12.471
6,500!

16:12.637 --> 16:14.932
I love how she lit up
those insecure, competitive men.

16:15.098 --> 16:16.756
7,500.

16:16.881 --> 16:17.894
8,000.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.313
- 8,000! Great!
- Idiots.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.481
8,500.
Put that down.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.462
- $10,000.
- 10,500--

16:24.587 --> 16:25.693
give me the paddles.

16:25.859 --> 16:26.819
Give me the paddles right now.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.066
Give it to me. Go.

16:29.191 --> 16:30.600
Just because you're not my husband

16:30.725 --> 16:32.168
does not mean I won't paddle you, go.

16:32.293 --> 16:33.284
Ow!

16:33.450 --> 16:37.747
Makes my big toe shoot up in my boot.

16:39.431 --> 16:42.377
Ignore their bids.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.671
Do I hear 11,000
for an Australian vacation?

16:45.837 --> 16:47.446
Crikey!

16:47.571 --> 16:49.248
You two have gone completely insane.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.427
Now look, I know that
I promised I wasn't

16:51.593 --> 16:54.096
going to say anything,
but you two need to talk.

16:54.262 --> 16:57.016
Right now.
So start saying things

16:57.182 --> 16:58.351
on the count of three.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.352
One.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.519
Two.

17:00.685 --> 17:01.824
Three.

17:01.949 --> 17:03.292
- I make seven figures.
- I can do 40 chin-ups in a row.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.191
God, you guys suck.
Will you stop sucking?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.317
- Ow.
- Ow!

17:10.319 --> 17:12.990
I quit the firm so that
I could stay home with Amy.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.601
I'm not a lawyer anymore.

17:14.726 --> 17:17.453
I'm... not killing it.

17:17.618 --> 17:19.329
Seriously?

17:24.301 --> 17:26.377
I haven't worked in a year.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.964
Deutsche Bank let me go.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.838
Oh, my God.
Casey, I didn't...

17:33.843 --> 17:35.119
Do you know how hard it is

17:35.244 --> 17:37.488
to be fired by
a guy with a German accent?

17:37.613 --> 17:39.222
Every time I begged
Herr Schmidt for my job back,

17:39.347 --> 17:41.391
he just said <i>"nein."</i>

17:41.516 --> 17:43.392
Come on, Herr Schmidt
said <i>"nein"</i> to you? No way.

17:43.517 --> 17:47.358
Yeah, it's a long flight
back to the states.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.564
Reagan Brinkley,
I want to thank you again.

17:49.689 --> 17:51.862
This was our most
successful auction ever.

17:52.209 --> 17:54.835
And I have a little
something for Amy.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.536
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.997
Oh, I'm so proud.
Look at that.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.341
Oh...

18:02.466 --> 18:05.167
What's that? I think
I just got a little nudge.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.145
Oh, is it okay if I bring
Amy by next week,

18:07.270 --> 18:09.005
just to get acclimated
to the campus and...

18:09.171 --> 18:11.632
Of course, anything
for the woman who got us Ava.

18:11.798 --> 18:12.633
Oh.

18:12.799 --> 18:13.950
And feel free to bring by

18:14.075 --> 18:15.261
some of your other celebrity friends.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.138
Okay, yeah. I...

18:17.304 --> 18:18.254
Stars help brand us.

18:18.379 --> 18:19.473
I mean, they make little nudge shine.

18:19.639 --> 18:22.226
Do you know Hugh Jackman
or any of the Gyllenhaals?

18:22.392 --> 18:23.458
Hi, ladies.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.926
Oh, Ava.
Thank you so much.

18:26.051 --> 18:29.025
People like you are
what this school is all about.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.901
Do you think that we could
get an autographed picture?

18:31.067 --> 18:32.611
Sure.
Just talk to Missy.

18:32.777 --> 18:34.333
Oh, great.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.240
So, that went great, right?
Are you happy?

18:36.626 --> 18:38.603
It was... thank you.

18:38.728 --> 18:40.503
- Really, you were amazing.
- I know.

18:40.628 --> 18:42.204
And look, she's in.

18:42.370 --> 18:45.041
- Aww. That's cute.
- Yeah, she's in.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.792
It's just that, uhh...

18:46.958 --> 18:48.669
They're kind of star-[Bleep], huh?

18:48.835 --> 18:51.070
They are.
They want to [Bleep] Stars.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.631
Yeah, I know.

18:52.797 --> 18:54.784
Look, I know it's not my place,

18:54.909 --> 18:57.619
but maybe Amy should go to a school

18:57.744 --> 19:00.765
where she's the star, you know,
instead of someone like me.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.727
I know. I just want to do
what's best for her, you know?

19:04.893 --> 19:07.728
Oh, sweetie.
A lot of places can be best

19:07.853 --> 19:10.030
with the right parts
and the right kid.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.609
And you got both.

19:28.003 --> 19:30.252
Ha.

19:30.418 --> 19:33.349
So, you... at home

19:33.474 --> 19:36.484
with the baby every day.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.219
That's hard to picture.

19:41.479 --> 19:43.155
Yeah, I know.
It's tough sometimes.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.614
But you know what?
I'm glad I did it.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.392
It's really nice.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.661
So, when you're at home,
in the afternoon,

19:49.786 --> 19:51.816
watching soaps, what do you rock?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.498
A housecoat or a slip?

19:53.623 --> 19:55.027
Dick.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.738
No, you know what?

19:57.904 --> 20:00.366
I really admire, brother.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.909
Aww.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.640
Next time, you keep me
in the loop, okay, buddy?

20:03.765 --> 20:05.121
Yeah, you too.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.914
Who can make a three-pointer?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.184
That would be me.

20:08.422 --> 20:09.333
Let's see it.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.588
Oh, nice, brother.

20:19.445 --> 20:20.386
Boom.

20:25.032 --> 20:27.577
Aww, look at this place.
It's so normal.

20:27.702 --> 20:30.813
Yeah.
Babe, they've got a tire swing.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.817
We had a tire swing at my preschool.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.152
- Babe, wind me up.
- Okay.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.386
Ruh!

20:37.511 --> 20:39.405
- Wait, you ready?
- Yeah.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.781
- Don't be shy.
- I'm not gonna be shy.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.619
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.872
- Nice school.
- Yeah.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.563
We've actually got a child.

20:49.688 --> 20:52.032
Yeah, yeah. We're not...
We're not, like, weirdos

20:52.157 --> 20:53.609
or anything like that.

20:54.450 --> 20:55.269
We're gonna go.

20:55.394 --> 20:57.673
Yeah, well, we'll just,
this will just take a sec.

20:57.968 --> 21:00.176
- Just, can you make it faster?
- Yep.
