<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.110
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.280
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.160 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.870 --> 01:57.570
<b>Consider this a warning...</b>

01:57.570 --> 01:58.590
<b>First,</b>

01:58.590 --> 02:03.560
<b>a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the 
member's number on the spider.</b>

02:04.250 --> 02:05.580
<b>Second,</b>

02:05.580 --> 02:10.310
<b>they don't bother counting 
how many they've killed.</b>

02:11.470 --> 02:12.890
<b>Third,</b>

02:12.890 --> 02:15.950
<b>never mention the Troupe again.</b>

02:17.600 --> 02:19.010
<b>If you do,</b>

02:20.200 --> 02:22.830
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

02:22.830 --> 02:27.830
<b>Trick x To The x Trick</b>

02:31.130 --> 02:33.980
<b>Leorio has volunteered for 
the fourth round.</b>

02:34.440 --> 02:37.340
<b>If he wins, the group's victory is assured.</b>

02:38.740 --> 02:41.070
<b>But can he win?</b>

02:50.970 --> 02:51.950
<b>Okay!</b>

02:51.950 --> 02:53.440
<b>I'll finish up the job.</b>

02:53.700 --> 02:57.190
<b>Toss that guy out, and send in 
your next competitor!</b>

03:01.340 --> 03:02.950
<b>We can't do that.</b>

03:02.950 --> 03:04.450
<b>What's that?</b>

03:04.910 --> 03:07.520
<b>We can't move him yet,</b>

03:07.520 --> 03:09.720
<b>because his match hasn't been settled.</b>

03:10.210 --> 03:12.710
<b>The match hasn't been settled?</b>

03:13.300 --> 03:15.210
<b>What do you mean?</b>

03:20.610 --> 03:22.280
<b>He's still alive.</b>

03:22.280 --> 03:23.590
<b>He was only knocked out.</b>

03:26.450 --> 03:27.610
<b>Did you forget?</b>

03:27.610 --> 03:29.250
<b>This was a death match.</b>

03:29.250 --> 03:33.750
<b>The fight doesn't end until one 
contestant surrenders or dies.</b>

03:35.110 --> 03:38.520
<b>He's still alive, and he 
hasn't surrendered.</b>

03:42.810 --> 03:45.080
<b>Tsk... Damned technicalities!</b>

03:45.080 --> 03:47.750
<b>But she's right.</b>

03:47.750 --> 03:49.070
<b>I agree.</b>

03:49.990 --> 03:51.250
<b>I see...</b>

03:51.850 --> 03:53.290
<b>Hey, Kurapika!</b>

03:53.290 --> 03:56.250
<b>Go finish off that worthless trash.</b>

03:56.790 --> 03:58.250
<b>I refuse.</b>

03:58.250 --> 03:59.240
<b>Huh?</b>

03:59.790 --> 04:01.450
<b>Why?!</b>

04:02.840 --> 04:05.010
<b>The fight is over.</b>

04:06.220 --> 04:09.680
<b>He'd already lost his will to fight</b>

04:10.790 --> 04:12.330
<b>when I punched him.</b>

04:15.420 --> 04:18.770
<b>I will not fight someone who's lost.</b>

04:19.150 --> 04:20.220
<b>Screw that!</b>

04:20.220 --> 04:21.600
<b>Then what do we do?</b>

04:21.600 --> 04:24.780
<b>They're claiming that the 
match hasn't ended!</b>

04:25.360 --> 04:26.860
<b>Let him handle it.</b>

04:26.860 --> 04:27.790
<b>Huh?!</b>

04:28.610 --> 04:32.290
<b>Once he wakes up, 
we'll have our answer.</b>

04:32.290 --> 04:33.770
<b>Hey, now...</b>

04:33.770 --> 04:36.680
<b>We only have so much time left.</b>

04:36.680 --> 04:38.700
<b>We can't afford to just sit and wait!</b>

04:38.700 --> 04:40.790
<b>I have no intention of killing him!</b>

04:40.790 --> 04:42.540
<b>Come on!</b>

04:42.540 --> 04:43.300
<b>Hey...</b>

04:43.300 --> 04:46.300
<b>If you don't want to dirty 
your hands, I'll do it.</b>

04:46.560 --> 04:47.430
<b>Killua?</b>

04:48.190 --> 04:50.510
<b>You haven't ever killed 
anyone before, right?</b>

04:52.840 --> 04:54.060
<b>Are you scared?</b>

04:54.860 --> 04:58.810
<b>I have never considered whether 
murder is frightening.</b>

04:59.760 --> 05:02.570
<b>But this is a one-on-one battle.</b>

05:02.570 --> 05:04.320
<b>You aren't permitted to interfere.</b>

05:04.760 --> 05:06.380
<b>Okay, then...</b>

05:07.320 --> 05:10.420
<b>But we're working as a team,</b>

05:10.420 --> 05:11.950
<b>so you shouldn't be too selfish.</b>

05:11.950 --> 05:12.670
<b>Oh!</b>

05:12.670 --> 05:14.530
<b>You do say useful things sometimes!</b>

05:14.530 --> 05:15.860
<b>Keep it up!</b>

05:15.860 --> 05:18.330
<b>Don't you understand that you're 
screwing up our chances?</b>

05:18.940 --> 05:21.560
<b>I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind.</b>

05:21.560 --> 05:24.340
<b>You stubborn fool...</b>

05:24.780 --> 05:25.970
<b>Fine!</b>

05:25.970 --> 05:27.590
<b>A majority decision...</b>

05:28.090 --> 05:29.850
<b>O to kill him,</b>

05:30.300 --> 05:32.100
<b>and X to leave him alive.</b>

05:32.700 --> 05:34.100
<b>Ready, and...</b>

05:38.310 --> 05:40.810
<b>Why isn't it working?!</b>

05:41.510 --> 05:43.990
<b>Maybe it's because we're 
asking the question?</b>

05:44.570 --> 05:45.570
<b>Huh?</b>

05:45.570 --> 05:49.630
<b>The watches only work for questions 
presented by the examiners.</b>

05:51.070 --> 05:52.290
<b>I see...</b>

05:52.290 --> 05:53.330
<b>Okay!</b>

05:53.750 --> 05:55.860
<b>Then we'll use a show of hands!</b>

05:55.860 --> 05:58.580
<b>Those who agree that he 
should be finished off...</b>

05:58.580 --> 05:59.940
<b>Now!</b>

06:06.590 --> 06:08.610
<b>You traitor...</b>

06:08.610 --> 06:11.650
<b>Weren't you just lecturing 
Kurapika with me?</b>

06:11.650 --> 06:14.800
<b>We're supposed to be a team... 
A team!</b>

06:14.800 --> 06:16.200
<b>But it's pointless!</b>

06:16.200 --> 06:17.850
<b>He's not gonna change his mind.</b>

06:17.850 --> 06:18.920
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

06:18.920 --> 06:20.960
<b>Why do you oppose killing him?</b>

06:20.960 --> 06:22.940
<b>Kurapika's right.</b>

06:22.940 --> 06:26.360
<b>He was on the verge of surrendering.</b>

06:27.900 --> 06:29.860
<b>Let's wait for him to wake up.</b>

06:30.340 --> 06:33.070
<b>We don't know how long 
that will take.</b>

06:33.850 --> 06:35.620
<b>I should just...</b>

06:35.620 --> 06:38.000
<b>You shouldn't force others to do things.</b>

06:38.000 --> 06:41.120
<b>Different people have different 
circumstances and ideals.</b>

06:41.120 --> 06:43.750
<b>No one asked your opinion.</b>

06:43.750 --> 06:44.880
<b>Hey...</b>

06:44.880 --> 06:48.140
<b>A majority ruling implies that you're 
asking everyone's opinion.</b>

06:49.260 --> 06:51.420
<b>Damn it! Fine!</b>

06:51.420 --> 06:53.200
<b>Do whatever you want!</b>

06:53.500 --> 06:54.770
<b>Leorio...</b>

06:57.030 --> 06:59.020
<b>Man, what's wrong with these people?</b>

06:59.890 --> 07:01.270
<b>Now he's sulking.</b>

07:01.630 --> 07:04.100
<b>None of this matters if we can't even progress.</b>

07:04.100 --> 07:06.050
<b>Don't you people get it?</b>

07:07.140 --> 07:08.660
<b>Just leave him alone.</b>

07:10.350 --> 07:11.530
<b><i>Fools...</i></b>

07:11.530 --> 07:15.530
<b><i>They've fallen for the trap 
of the majority decision.</i></b>

07:16.250 --> 07:20.640
<b><i>You would expect it to be easier 
for five people who've just met</i></b>

07:20.640 --> 07:24.290
<b><i>to make decisions by majority rule.</i></b>

07:24.970 --> 07:28.460
<b><i>While this method appears to 
revere each individual opinion,</i></b>

07:28.760 --> 07:32.300
<b><i>in actuality, it suppresses the minority.</i></b>

07:33.410 --> 07:36.000
<b><i>When a person consistently finds himself 
in the minority,</i></b>

07:36.000 --> 07:38.710
<b><i>his opinion is always rejected.</i></b>

07:38.710 --> 07:39.980
<b><i>His alienation,</i></b>

07:39.980 --> 07:43.990
<b><i>anger, and discontent lead to antagonism.</i></b>

07:43.990 --> 07:46.320
<b><i>Eventually, the team dissolves.</i></b>

07:47.380 --> 07:51.280
<b><i>After all, we're rivals in 
this Hunter Exam.</i></b>

07:51.280 --> 07:54.880
<b><i>None of us would just 
stand by and watch,</i></b>

07:54.880 --> 07:56.780
<b><i>as our chances were hurt</i></b>

07:56.780 --> 07:59.930
<b><i>by someone else's dumb mistakes.</i></b>

07:59.930 --> 08:02.750
<b><i>But having been caught up in 
the spirit of this test,</i></b>

08:03.040 --> 08:07.200
<b><i>he's begun using majority decision 
in unrelated situations.</i></b>

08:07.800 --> 08:10.220
<b><i>And he made the mistake of holding</i></b>

08:10.220 --> 08:12.680
<b><i>a discussion before the vote.</i></b>

08:13.180 --> 08:17.680
<b><i>He even used majority decision in its 
worst form, a public show of hands.</i></b>

08:18.270 --> 08:22.160
<b><i>Unlike when people press the buttons 
of their own watches,</i></b>

08:22.160 --> 08:26.390
<b><i>everyone knows who diverged 
from the majority.</i></b>

08:26.390 --> 08:28.940
<b><i>So the minority can't even 
protest the decision.</i></b>

08:29.900 --> 08:33.660
<b><i>When someone feels they have no say,</i></b>

08:33.660 --> 08:37.900
<b><i>and that their opinions are 
constantly rejected,</i></b>

08:37.900 --> 08:40.030
<b><i>the group breaks down.</i></b>

08:40.030 --> 08:41.360
<b><i>In this case,</i></b>

08:41.360 --> 08:44.210
<b><i>it means all five of us will fail the exam.</i></b>

08:45.080 --> 08:46.840
<b><i>It's just a matter of time.</i></b>

08:52.180 --> 08:55.470
<b>The atmosphere on the 
other side is gloomy.</b>

09:23.840 --> 09:25.540
<b>I've been waiting for you...</b>

09:27.350 --> 09:28.630
<b>...Hisoka.</b>

09:29.100 --> 09:30.890
<b>I'm not an examiner this year.</b>

09:30.890 --> 09:32.510
<b>I'm here for revenge.</b>

09:33.110 --> 09:34.680
<b>Since last year's exam,</b>

09:34.680 --> 09:37.250
<b>all I've focused on was killing you.</b>

09:40.310 --> 09:42.350
<b>Today, I'll get payback</b>

09:42.900 --> 09:44.530
<b>for my scars!</b>

09:46.060 --> 09:47.010
<b>Hmph.</b>

09:47.010 --> 09:51.110
<b>Those scars merely show that you 
were an incompetent examiner.</b>

09:51.490 --> 09:53.860
<b>You're blaming me for your 
own inadequacies.</b>

09:53.860 --> 09:55.470
<b>Keep yapping!</b>

09:57.040 --> 09:58.860
<b>Prepare to die.</b>

09:59.520 --> 10:01.210
<b>Dual wielding?</b>

10:06.090 --> 10:07.790
<b>Infinite quad wielding!</b>

10:09.040 --> 10:10.210
<b>Take this...</b>

10:27.930 --> 10:29.020
<b>It's not over yet!</b>

10:34.980 --> 10:36.590
<b>Up, down, left, right.</b>

10:36.590 --> 10:37.690
<b>Front and back...</b>

10:37.690 --> 10:39.150
<b>You have nowhere to run!</b>

10:39.150 --> 10:43.160
<b>You'll be cut from every angle, 
by my endless stream of blades.</b>

10:43.160 --> 10:46.010
<b>Dodging my infinite attack waves 
is impossible!</b>

10:46.440 --> 10:49.000
<b>I'll have you writhe in pain...</b>

10:52.170 --> 10:55.130
<b>...until you die, Hisoka!</b>

11:02.330 --> 11:05.480
<b>It would indeed be difficult 
to dodge your attacks.</b>

11:07.700 --> 11:10.100
<b>Thus, I should simply stop the blades.</b>

11:10.750 --> 11:11.780
<b><i>Impossible...</i></b>

11:11.780 --> 11:15.860
<b><i>It took me over half a year 
to master catching those blades!</i></b>

11:20.510 --> 11:21.530
<b>Oh...</b>

11:23.100 --> 11:25.330
<b>It was easier than anticipated.</b>

11:26.640 --> 11:29.580
<b>I appreciate your futile efforts.</b>

11:33.080 --> 11:34.450
<b>Damn it!</b>

11:39.070 --> 11:49.140
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:44.970 --> 11:49.140
<b>Hisoka</b>

12:02.690 --> 12:06.660
<b>Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first 
to pass the Third Phase.</b>

12:07.220 --> 12:10.750
<b>Total time, six hours and 
seventeen minutes.</b>

12:19.060 --> 12:19.830
<b>Tsk...</b>

12:39.580 --> 12:41.310
<b>Is something wrong, Gon?</b>

12:41.310 --> 12:42.310
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

12:49.050 --> 12:50.700
<b>I get it...</b>

12:52.770 --> 12:53.730
<b>Hey...</b>

12:54.570 --> 12:57.080
<b>It's quite possible that 
he's already dead.</b>

13:00.090 --> 13:01.490
<b>What's that?</b>

13:01.490 --> 13:03.470
<b>Well, it's been several hours,</b>

13:03.470 --> 13:05.410
<b>and he hasn't moved an inch.</b>

13:11.740 --> 13:12.950
<b>Damn...</b>

13:12.950 --> 13:15.490
<b>It's too far away for us to tell.</b>

13:17.050 --> 13:20.860
<b>Hey! We want to check his body!</b>

13:21.690 --> 13:23.360
<b>What's that?</b>

13:23.820 --> 13:27.360
<b>He could already be dead.</b>

13:27.830 --> 13:31.370
<b>I already told you, 
he's only unconscious.</b>

13:31.370 --> 13:34.460
<b>How many hours has it been?</b>

13:34.460 --> 13:37.200
<b>I can't just take your word for it!</b>

13:38.400 --> 13:40.110
<b>Then let's make a bet.</b>

13:41.250 --> 13:42.250
<b>A bet?</b>

13:42.840 --> 13:44.380
<b>On what?</b>

13:45.900 --> 13:48.120
<b>On whether he's dead or alive.</b>

13:50.430 --> 13:52.260
<b>What would we wager?</b>

13:55.160 --> 13:56.190
<b>Time.</b>

13:56.950 --> 13:57.810
<b>Time?</b>

14:00.680 --> 14:04.000
<b>We will settle our match through 
a betting game, a gamble.</b>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.030
<b>And we'll use time, rather than chips.</b>

14:08.310 --> 14:10.740
<b>Look at the monitor on the wall.</b>

14:12.270 --> 14:15.240
<b>We each have fifty hours.</b>

14:15.240 --> 14:18.610
<b>However, we can only wager 
multiples of ten.</b>

14:20.050 --> 14:23.250
<b>We continue placing bets until one 
of us has no hours left.</b>

14:24.570 --> 14:27.220
<b>A match where we gamble time...</b>

14:27.900 --> 14:30.580
<b>We'll take turns deciding 
what to bet on.</b>

14:31.880 --> 14:33.750
<b>If you end up with zero hours,</b>

14:33.750 --> 14:36.740
<b>your time limit will also be 
shortened by fifty hours.</b>

14:38.140 --> 14:40.230
<b>And if you end up with zero hours?</b>

14:40.750 --> 14:43.730
<b>Our sentences will be 
extended by fifty years.</b>

14:45.110 --> 14:46.730
<b>If these terms are acceptable,</b>

14:46.730 --> 14:49.240
<b>I'll check whether he's still alive.</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:54.790
<b>Leroute...</b>

14:55.210 --> 14:57.460
<b>Serving a 112-year sentence</b>

14:57.460 --> 15:01.290
<b>for endangered species trafficking 
and illegal gambling.</b>

15:01.790 --> 15:04.950
<b>This match sounds like 
her kind of game.</b>

15:06.780 --> 15:08.730
<b>Man, this chick is whack.</b>

15:10.200 --> 15:12.700
<b>She's willing to risk extending 
her own sentence.</b>

15:12.700 --> 15:15.180
<b>Consider your answer carefully, Leorio.</b>

15:15.770 --> 15:18.970
<b>If you lose, we'll have 
fifty fewer hours</b>

15:18.970 --> 15:20.690
<b>with which to escape the tower.</b>

15:20.690 --> 15:23.130
<b>You shouldn't talk...</b>

15:23.550 --> 15:27.100
<b>After all, this is your fault, 
for not finishing him off!</b>

15:27.690 --> 15:29.150
<b>Fine!</b>

15:29.150 --> 15:31.350
<b>I won't say another word!</b>

15:31.720 --> 15:35.090
<b>Hey, we shouldn't fight 
amongst ourselves!</b>

15:37.390 --> 15:39.720
<b><i>Keep fighting, keep fighting...</i></b>

15:40.550 --> 15:41.710
<b>Right!</b>

15:41.710 --> 15:43.560
<b>I accept!</b>

15:44.650 --> 15:48.000
<b>Okay! I chose our first bet,</b>

15:48.000 --> 15:51.490
<b>so you can decide how 
many hours we'll wager</b>

15:51.490 --> 15:53.060
<b>on whether he's alive or dead.</b>

15:56.800 --> 15:59.220
<b>I bet ten hours that he's alive.</b>

16:00.840 --> 16:02.220
<b>What's this?</b>

16:02.220 --> 16:05.400
<b>You were the one whining 
over his being dead.</b>

16:06.530 --> 16:09.230
<b>Very well. Then let's check.</b>

16:10.030 --> 16:12.070
<b>You're being pretty cautious...</b>

16:12.870 --> 16:15.370
<b>Weren't you going to not 
say anything else?</b>

16:16.630 --> 16:18.490
<b><i>Ten hours, huh?</i></b>

16:20.710 --> 16:22.500
<b><i>This was the obvious choice.</i></b>

16:22.890 --> 16:25.070
<b><i>Even if I'm wrong,</i></b>

16:25.070 --> 16:27.000
<b><i>as long as we confirm his death,</i></b>

16:27.000 --> 16:29.280
<b><i>Kurapika will have won his round.</i></b>

16:30.260 --> 16:33.130
<b><i>If he's really unconscious,</i></b>

16:33.130 --> 16:35.890
<b><i>I'll just kick his ass.</i></b>

16:45.840 --> 16:48.440
<b>See? He's only unconscious.</b>

16:48.440 --> 16:50.150
<b>So it seems.</b>

16:51.730 --> 16:52.650
<b>All right...</b>

16:52.650 --> 16:55.010
<b>Leorio has the lead!</b>

16:55.760 --> 16:56.890
<b>This is bad.</b>

16:56.890 --> 16:57.660
<b>Huh?</b>

16:58.190 --> 17:01.640
<b>It's possible he isn't going to wake up.</b>

17:01.640 --> 17:03.070
<b>What do you mean?</b>

17:04.050 --> 17:05.600
<b>Remember when that woman</b>

17:05.600 --> 17:07.880
<b>walked near the guy on the floor?</b>

17:07.880 --> 17:09.010
<b>What of it?</b>

17:09.010 --> 17:10.050
<b>I thought then</b>

17:10.530 --> 17:13.380
<b>that he was already dead.</b>

17:13.380 --> 17:14.720
<b>But on second thought,</b>

17:14.720 --> 17:17.520
<b>they'd obviously prefer him alive,</b>

17:17.520 --> 17:20.060
<b>but remaining unconscious.</b>

17:20.580 --> 17:23.590
<b>If he doesn't wake up 
before the test ends,</b>

17:23.590 --> 17:26.720
<b>it shortens their sentences 
by seventy-two years.</b>

17:28.360 --> 17:31.200
<b>So if he doesn't wake up...</b>

17:31.200 --> 17:32.740
<b>That's my point!</b>

17:32.740 --> 17:35.570
<b>That's been their intention all along.</b>

17:39.930 --> 17:42.190
<b>Well, it's your turn.</b>

17:42.190 --> 17:44.400
<b>Decide what we'll bet on.</b>

17:44.400 --> 17:46.080
<b>Let's see...</b>

17:52.370 --> 17:55.590
<b>How about we bet on whether 
he's truly unconscious?</b>

17:55.590 --> 17:56.590
<b>Huh?</b>

17:57.230 --> 17:58.590
<b>I see.</b>

18:02.420 --> 18:05.450
<b><i>Hey, what am I supposed to do?</i></b>

18:05.450 --> 18:07.690
<b><i>The note didn't cover this.</i></b>

18:11.880 --> 18:15.490
<b><i>When I woke up, a note next to me</i></b>

18:16.100 --> 18:18.060
<b><i>told me to feign unconsciousness,</i></b>

18:18.060 --> 18:21.350
<b><i>and to hide the note in my mouth.</i></b>

18:22.370 --> 18:24.750
<b><i>I understood the plan immediately.</i></b>

18:25.830 --> 18:28.750
<b><i>If I can buy time by pretending 
to be asleep,</i></b>

18:28.750 --> 18:32.750
<b><i>our sentences will be shortened 
by seventy-two years!</i></b>

18:33.870 --> 18:35.500
<b><i>So, then what do I do?</i></b>

18:35.500 --> 18:37.760
<b><i>Should I stay down?</i></b>

18:38.270 --> 18:39.680
<b>Very well.</b>

18:39.680 --> 18:43.010
<b>I bet twenty hours that he 
really is unconscious.</b>

18:43.880 --> 18:45.880
<b><i>Okay, got it...</i></b>

18:45.880 --> 18:49.110
<b><i>I'm supposed to keep acting 
like I'm unconscious!</i></b>

18:50.040 --> 18:54.900
<b>But how do we confirm whether 
he's really unconscious?</b>

18:56.330 --> 18:57.450
<b>Oh...</b>

18:59.480 --> 19:01.230
<b>That's simple.</b>

19:03.740 --> 19:05.410
<b>This guy's heavy...</b>

19:10.040 --> 19:12.420
<b>I'll just toss him off the edge.</b>

19:12.900 --> 19:15.420
<b><i>Wh-What the hell?!</i></b>

19:16.040 --> 19:18.110
<b>If he's actually unconscious,</b>

19:18.110 --> 19:21.040
<b>he'll fall to his death.</b>

19:22.500 --> 19:24.180
<b>Are you insane?</b>

19:24.790 --> 19:27.410
<b>His match hasn't been settled yet.</b>

19:27.410 --> 19:29.480
<b>We can't accept those terms.</b>

19:30.530 --> 19:31.550
<b>Don't worry.</b>

19:32.130 --> 19:34.190
<b>If he falls and dies,</b>

19:34.610 --> 19:37.230
<b>we'll forfeit the match,</b>

19:37.230 --> 19:39.450
<b>which will give you two wins.</b>

19:40.060 --> 19:41.890
<b>Is that satisfactory?</b>

19:44.390 --> 19:45.400
<b>Yes,</b>

19:46.000 --> 19:47.200
<b>it is.</b>

19:48.200 --> 19:49.190
<b><i>What was that?</i></b>

19:49.190 --> 19:51.280
<b><i>Don't be ridiculous...</i></b>

19:51.280 --> 19:53.710
<b><i>We're talking about my life here!</i></b>

19:54.530 --> 19:56.480
<b>But then I'm changing my wager.</b>

19:57.460 --> 20:01.020
<b>I bet forty hours that he 
isn't unconscious.</b>

20:01.020 --> 20:03.340
<b>Everything I have left.</b>

20:05.260 --> 20:07.230
<b>Heh, little sneak.</b>

20:07.230 --> 20:09.410
<b>Finally showing your true colors.</b>

20:23.820 --> 20:25.380
<b>Then, I'll let go of him.</b>

20:27.870 --> 20:29.120
<b>Whoa! Wait!</b>

20:29.120 --> 20:30.970
<b>I'm awake! I'm awake...</b>

20:30.970 --> 20:32.580
<b>Don't let go!</b>

20:35.200 --> 20:37.090
<b>Wait! Whoa...</b>

20:37.090 --> 20:39.850
<b>I'm gonna fall!</b>

20:41.260 --> 20:43.090
<b>Good morning.</b>

20:46.520 --> 20:48.360
<b>You people are crazy.</b>

20:48.940 --> 20:50.840
<b>I've had enough!</b>

20:50.840 --> 20:52.890
<b>I'll take the loss!</b>

20:53.410 --> 20:55.400
<b>Forget the sentence reduction!</b>

20:55.890 --> 20:59.650
<b>It's safer in prison...</b>

21:03.470 --> 21:06.910
<b>You knew that he was awake.</b>

21:07.330 --> 21:09.970
<b>I actually aspire to become a doctor.</b>

21:09.970 --> 21:12.810
<b>All I had to do was check 
his eye movement.</b>

21:15.820 --> 21:19.880
<b>However, you're down 
to twenty hours.</b>

21:20.650 --> 21:25.380
<b>But now we have a 2-1 lead.</b>

21:29.470 --> 21:30.390
<b>Now...</b>

21:30.770 --> 21:32.770
<b>It's your turn!</b>

21:33.350 --> 21:35.730
<b>What do you want to bet on?</b>

21:40.740 --> 21:42.760
<b>Majitani surrenders,</b>

21:42.760 --> 21:45.400
<b>giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead.</b>

21:46.580 --> 21:49.060
<b>However, in the time-betting match,</b>

21:49.060 --> 21:51.710
<b>they're down 80-20.</b>

21:52.290 --> 21:56.550
<b>What will Leroute choose to bet on?</b>

23:28.430 --> 23:30.690
<b>Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!</b>

23:30.690 --> 23:31.800
<b>Bulldog... Bulldog...</b>

23:31.800 --> 23:33.030
<b>Bulldog scramble!</b>
