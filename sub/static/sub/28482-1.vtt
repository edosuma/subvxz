01:37.825 --> 01:38.724
Hello.

01:38.759 --> 01:39.891
Hi.

01:39.927 --> 01:41.204
Would you like to sample
one of our Easter chocolates?

01:41.228 --> 01:42.461
These are handmade.

01:42.496 --> 01:43.795
Those are so cute.

01:43.831 --> 01:45.631
Jessie, this isn't just
any customer.

01:45.666 --> 01:46.732
Sorry, Miss Cavendish.

01:46.767 --> 01:47.699
It's fine.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.635
This is Erin Cavendish,
director of marketing.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.169
She visits the store
quite often.

01:51.205 --> 01:51.970
Nice to meet you.

01:52.006 --> 01:53.305
I'm so sorry, Miss Cavendish.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.206
I didn't know.

01:54.241 --> 01:56.308
It's okay. I keep a pretty
low profile.

01:56.343 --> 01:58.443
I'm not exactly the face
of the company.

02:10.591 --> 02:12.090
- Good morning.
- Morning, Parker.

02:12.126 --> 02:13.126
Coffee?

02:13.427 --> 02:14.960
- Notes.
- Thank you.

02:14.995 --> 02:16.595
Carter's about to start
in the boardroom.

02:16.630 --> 02:17.874
With Easter almost
six weeks away,

02:17.898 --> 02:21.033
our first shipments are arriving
in stores across the country,

02:21.068 --> 02:23.902
including the output
from our newly implemented

02:23.937 --> 02:26.571
automated line at
the Sweetwater factory.

02:26.607 --> 02:28.006
And here is a sneak preview.

02:28.042 --> 02:31.209
Pass 'em around, don't be shy.

02:31.245 --> 02:33.845
More machines means
faster turnover.

02:33.881 --> 02:37.249
If all goes well, our Iowa
factory will follow suit.

02:37.284 --> 02:38.583
Thank you, Carter.

02:38.619 --> 02:42.187
We certainly appreciate
your optimism.

02:42.222 --> 02:43.889
But as we know, last year,

02:43.924 --> 02:46.224
for the first time
in Cavendish history,

02:46.260 --> 02:47.859
Easter sales were down.

02:47.895 --> 02:49.561
This happen again.

02:49.596 --> 02:51.697
As most of you may have heard
by now, our VP,

02:51.732 --> 02:52.864
Bryce Cameron,

02:52.900 --> 02:57.202
was poached away by that
trendy new company, Chocmate.

02:57.237 --> 03:00.305
Couple that with our recent
lag in sales, and...

03:00.341 --> 03:02.941
If I may speak about Chocmate
for a moment, Foster.

03:05.012 --> 03:06.545
Mr. Cavendish.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.547
Chocmate may be the new kid
on the block,

03:08.582 --> 03:10.315
but they were No. 1 in sales
last quarter

03:10.351 --> 03:11.650
for the West Coast market.

03:11.685 --> 03:13.085
I'm well aware.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.587
Their modern flavours seem
to be catching on.

03:15.622 --> 03:18.790
I never thought green tea and
chocolate would go together.

03:18.826 --> 03:20.425
And they're more automated
than we are.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.805
Their product is getting
into the market

03:21.829 --> 03:23.762
with more speed and efficiency.

03:23.797 --> 03:24.763
So, until we decide

03:24.798 --> 03:27.065
to get rid of all our
handmade chocolates...

03:27.101 --> 03:28.834
But, part of our product's
appeal,

03:28.869 --> 03:32.070
from a marketing point of view,
is the personal touch, right?

03:32.106 --> 03:33.472
Artisan handcrafted chocolate

03:33.507 --> 03:37.142
is a major part of our identity,
our brand.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.177
Good point, Erin.

03:38.212 --> 03:40.512
But if you look at sales,
and Erin knows this,

03:40.547 --> 03:42.647
our brand clearly needs a boost,

03:42.683 --> 03:43.960
and from an operations
standpoint,

03:43.984 --> 03:45.617
I know we can do better.

03:45.652 --> 03:49.488
I have to be honest, Cavendish
Chocolates has lost a step.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.475
I was planning to announce
my retirement later this year

03:58.499 --> 04:00.465
but I just can't do that now.

04:00.501 --> 04:03.268
I don't have anyone I can trust
to take over,

04:03.303 --> 04:06.104
and I've gotta get to the bottom
of our problems.

04:06.140 --> 04:09.307
May... maybe Carter was right,
we've lost a step.

04:09.343 --> 04:11.176
But, we'll get back on track,
Dad.

04:11.211 --> 04:13.011
Well, I wanna see firsthand
how phase one

04:13.046 --> 04:15.147
of this first automation
is impacting operations

04:15.182 --> 04:16.481
at the Sweetwater factory.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.350
Maybe roll up my own sleeves,

04:18.385 --> 04:20.719
talk to the men and women
on the frontlines.

04:20.754 --> 04:23.622
They'll probably just tell you
what you want to hear.

04:23.657 --> 04:27.526
It's true, it could be difficult
to tell the boss the hard truth.

04:27.561 --> 04:28.527
You could always go undercover,

04:28.562 --> 04:31.830
disguise yourself as one
of the factory workers.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.001
Sorry, bad joke.

04:38.105 --> 04:39.738
Brilliant.

04:39.773 --> 04:40.739
What?

04:40.774 --> 04:42.040
But it can't be me.

04:42.075 --> 04:44.843
It has to be someone
less recognizable.

04:49.116 --> 04:50.348
Me?

04:50.384 --> 04:51.416
Who better?

04:51.452 --> 04:54.019
You've been good at keeping out
of the spotlight.

04:54.054 --> 04:57.055
Well, I, I haven't even been
at the company a year.

04:57.090 --> 04:57.989
Perfect.

04:58.025 --> 04:59.491
No one will recognize you.

04:59.526 --> 05:01.059
I have my MBA.

05:01.094 --> 05:01.893
And?

05:01.929 --> 05:03.428
And I wouldn't know
the first thing

05:03.464 --> 05:04.830
about working in a factory.

05:04.865 --> 05:06.331
Well, this isn't just
any factory,

05:06.366 --> 05:07.299
this is our flagship.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.734
This is the factory
your grandfather built,

05:09.770 --> 05:11.503
the heart and soul
of this business.

05:11.538 --> 05:14.673
I haven't been there since what,
I was 10 years old?

05:14.708 --> 05:16.541
What, so you'll have fresh eyes.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.555
And the three-hour drive
from Seattle to Sweetwater

05:18.579 --> 05:20.512
is really lovely.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.514
You know that I'm starting
my new marketing job

05:22.549 --> 05:23.615
in Chicago this May.

05:23.650 --> 05:26.184
I only took this position
as a favour to help you.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.587
Look, I know this is
not your passion,

05:28.622 --> 05:31.756
but if you could just do this
one thing for me.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.592
I mean think of it
as an opportunity

05:33.627 --> 05:36.027
for personal and
professional growth.

05:36.063 --> 05:37.462
Find out who you really are.

05:37.498 --> 05:38.463
But I already...

05:38.499 --> 05:40.365
You'll go down there as
an employee transferred

05:40.400 --> 05:42.200
from the Iowa factory.

05:42.236 --> 05:44.035
I'll sort out the details
with HR.

05:44.071 --> 05:45.370
Nobody else needs to know.

05:45.405 --> 05:47.672
Only who we need to pull it off.

05:49.576 --> 05:51.710
All right, fine.

05:51.745 --> 05:54.079
Excellent.

05:54.114 --> 05:56.882
Better pack your bags, you'll
probably be there a few weeks.

05:56.917 --> 05:57.682
A few weeks?

05:57.718 --> 05:59.918
Yeah, well, we need
a full report.

05:59.953 --> 06:01.453
Well what about
my department here?

06:01.488 --> 06:02.665
Well, you've surrounded yourself

06:02.689 --> 06:05.590
with a very talented marketing
team, we'll be just fine.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.159
Erin, your grandfather came

06:08.195 --> 06:10.395
to Sweetwater, Washington,
over 90 years ago,

06:10.430 --> 06:11.730
with nothing more than

06:11.765 --> 06:13.632
a suitcase and a dream.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.400
And how's that dream today?

06:15.435 --> 06:18.503
Well, the most famous chocolate
producer on the West Coast,

06:18.539 --> 06:21.139
a string of chocolate shops
across the country,

06:21.174 --> 06:24.175
even a chocolate museum
in his name.

06:24.211 --> 06:26.144
This is very important.

06:26.179 --> 06:28.213
This is family.

06:30.117 --> 06:31.983
Chocolate bunny?

06:41.495 --> 06:45.430
This is a chocolate buttercream
treasure chest.

06:45.465 --> 06:46.665
I made it personally.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.633
The box itself is
completely edible,

06:48.669 --> 06:50.769
made from our finest
handcrafted chocolate.

06:50.804 --> 06:52.370
And the best part is...

06:52.406 --> 06:57.008
It opens up, revealing a small
treasure of candy inside.

06:57.044 --> 06:58.009
Bryan.

06:58.045 --> 06:59.811
We're trying to phase out
handmade products.

06:59.846 --> 07:00.745
Yes, I know that, but...

07:00.781 --> 07:01.991
I'm very happy with
the chocolate lineup

07:02.015 --> 07:05.216
I have for next year.

07:05.252 --> 07:07.352
But I always appreciate
your visits coming down here

07:07.387 --> 07:09.120
from the factory.

07:09.156 --> 07:10.889
Keeps me thinking.

07:10.924 --> 07:13.124
Thanks.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.926
Okay.

07:16.096 --> 07:18.563
You can leave the box.

07:18.599 --> 07:21.299
Just so I have it on file.

07:24.171 --> 07:26.037
All right.

07:41.021 --> 07:42.053
Hi.

07:42.089 --> 07:43.154
I'm Veronica Erinson.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.024
It's a pleasure to meet you.

07:46.059 --> 07:48.360
I can't believe I'm doing this.

07:48.395 --> 07:49.861
You can't tell anyone
in the office.

07:49.896 --> 07:51.496
This has to be our secret.

07:51.531 --> 07:52.775
But everybody knows
that I'm the worst

07:52.799 --> 07:54.232
at keeping secrets.

07:54.267 --> 07:57.268
Here. Take my car keys.

07:57.304 --> 07:58.837
I can drive your Lexus?

07:58.872 --> 08:00.572
Yes. Park it in my spot.

08:00.607 --> 08:02.007
It'll be like I'm still here.

08:02.042 --> 08:03.742
And I'll take your car
to Sweetwater.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.910
If anyone comes looking for me,
take a message.

08:05.946 --> 08:07.379
It'll be like I never left.

08:07.414 --> 08:09.914
This is so exciting.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.961
If you have any questions for me
about the Easter campaign,

08:11.985 --> 08:12.917
call me.

08:12.953 --> 08:14.430
I left a ton of notes
for you on my lap...

08:14.454 --> 08:16.388
We'll be fine.

08:16.423 --> 08:17.722
Veronica.

08:22.663 --> 08:24.429
Veronica.

08:34.975 --> 08:36.207
<i>I just got to the B&B, Dad.</i>

08:36.243 --> 08:38.909
<i>I'll call you later, bye.</i>

08:42.082 --> 08:43.948
Welcome.

08:43.984 --> 08:46.618
Your house is charming.

08:46.653 --> 08:49.721
I'm Lyla, this is my husband,
Grant.

08:49.756 --> 08:50.722
Nice to meet you.

08:50.757 --> 08:52.390
I'm Veronica Erinson.

08:55.162 --> 08:57.462
Your house is so lovely.

08:57.497 --> 09:00.965
Thank you, we like to think of
it as the finest B&B in town.

09:01.001 --> 09:03.568
Well, it'll only be temporary
until I can find my own place.

09:03.603 --> 09:05.937
However long you stay,
the upstairs is all yours.

09:05.972 --> 09:08.073
And the kitchen is here.

09:08.108 --> 09:09.318
You're welcome to use the stove

09:09.342 --> 09:12.077
and there's always a seat at
the dinner table if you like.

09:12.112 --> 09:13.645
Thank you, that's very kind.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.591
So you're starting work
at the chocolate factory?

09:15.615 --> 09:16.815
First thing tomorrow.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.617
Lyla and I used to work at the
Cavendish factory ourselves.

09:19.653 --> 09:20.819
Really?

09:20.854 --> 09:22.520
Over 30 years.
It's where we met.

09:22.556 --> 09:26.024
Now we're retired and run
the Cavendish Chocolate Museum.

09:26.059 --> 09:28.793
That is so sweet.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.028
Pun intended?

09:31.531 --> 09:32.597
Have you been?

09:32.632 --> 09:34.432
Of course, it's the family...

09:36.903 --> 09:38.436
It's the family Cavendish.

09:38.472 --> 09:41.940
They're famous in these parts.

09:45.479 --> 09:46.611
I'm so tired.

09:46.646 --> 09:47.846
I had a really long drive,

09:47.881 --> 09:50.782
so I think I'm gonna go to bed
and get ready for tomorrow,

09:50.817 --> 09:53.184
so thank you.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.687
Goodnight, Erin.

09:55.722 --> 09:57.655
I don't think he told her.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.459
We know who you are, dear.

10:01.495 --> 10:02.694
Your dad told us.

10:02.729 --> 10:03.928
We go way back.

10:03.964 --> 10:07.232
The three of us used to work
on the assembly line together.

10:07.267 --> 10:09.400
Very inventive performance.

10:09.436 --> 10:11.503
Great start.

10:11.538 --> 10:16.307
Okay, well thank you.

10:16.343 --> 10:18.009
Good night.

10:44.104 --> 10:45.937
These new automated
cocoa bean sorters

10:45.972 --> 10:48.206
can't do the same precise work
as by hand.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.674
Give it time, Bryan.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.109
Chalk it up to growing pains.

10:51.144 --> 10:52.744
Growing pains.

10:54.381 --> 10:56.592
My department has lost four
good people to these machines

10:56.616 --> 10:58.716
in the last month.

10:58.752 --> 11:00.418
Sorry.

11:03.223 --> 11:04.122
Yes?

11:04.157 --> 11:06.591
I'm Erin... son.

11:06.626 --> 11:07.926
Veronica Erinson.

11:07.961 --> 11:09.561
Yes, of course.

11:09.596 --> 11:10.596
Word just got to me.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.197
Come in. Sit down.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.900
I'm Susan Enwright,
factory manager.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.902
I like to meet all our
new employees personally,

11:17.938 --> 11:21.072
no matter what department.

11:21.107 --> 11:22.874
Transfer from Iowa.

11:25.278 --> 11:28.379
First time in Sweetwater?

11:28.415 --> 11:29.981
Veronica?

11:31.852 --> 11:32.917
Yes?

11:32.953 --> 11:36.120
I asked if you've ever been
to Sweetwater before.

11:36.156 --> 11:40.558
Yes. When I was 10,
just driving through.

11:40.594 --> 11:41.793
Now.

11:44.865 --> 11:45.865
Wobbly chair.

11:45.899 --> 11:48.399
I've asked for a new one,
but red tape, right?

11:48.435 --> 11:49.400
Takes forever.

11:49.436 --> 11:51.135
I've given up.

11:51.171 --> 11:53.671
Now, you've probably heard
from your time in Iowa,

11:53.707 --> 11:57.408
but our latest company slogan is
"Living the Sweet Life".

11:57.444 --> 11:58.643
We have a new marketing team.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.478
I think they're doing
a great job.

12:00.513 --> 12:03.615
Ôhank you.

12:03.650 --> 12:07.518
For telling me that.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.120
So, welcome to Sweetwater,

12:09.155 --> 12:14.759
and I hope you will indeed live
the sweet life with us.

12:14.794 --> 12:16.527
I'll give you a quick tour.

12:16.563 --> 12:19.297
Grab an egg.

12:30.844 --> 12:34.545
You've arrived during our most
important season, Easter.

12:34.581 --> 12:37.649
Here at the factory,
we're all one big family.

12:37.684 --> 12:41.019
And I consider every
new employee to be like

12:41.054 --> 12:44.889
a piece of unformed chocolate,
waiting to be moulded.

12:44.925 --> 12:47.859
You'll be working one of the
assembly lines with Florence Baker,

12:47.894 --> 12:51.262
very experienced,
she'll show you the ropes.

12:59.205 --> 13:01.472
You can call me Flo,
that's what everyone does.

13:01.508 --> 13:02.640
Nice to meet you, Flo.

13:02.676 --> 13:03.708
We're gonna start you off

13:03.743 --> 13:06.077
with our famous butter chocolate
moulding machine.

13:06.112 --> 13:07.879
It creates the base
of one of Cavendish's

13:07.914 --> 13:09.347
most popular Easter treats,
the...

13:09.382 --> 13:10.715
Buttery Bunny.

13:10.750 --> 13:11.950
Right.

13:11.985 --> 13:14.196
It actually overtook the Rainbow
Rabbit the last two Easters

13:14.220 --> 13:16.254
as our most popular
spring chocolate.

13:16.289 --> 13:17.655
Is that right?

13:17.691 --> 13:19.257
Sales were down overall,

13:19.292 --> 13:21.526
but the Buttery Bunny
was a bright spot.

13:22.862 --> 13:23.828
I mean, that's what I heard.

13:23.863 --> 13:24.863
Where I used to work.

13:25.799 --> 13:27.932
In Iowa.

13:27.968 --> 13:29.845
All right then, let's just
make sure the Buttery Bunny

13:29.869 --> 13:32.036
keeps on going strong.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.238
Okay, this is the chocolate
flow over here,

13:34.274 --> 13:36.841
the moulds come down the
conveyer belt like this,

13:36.876 --> 13:40.178
you step on the pedal to
stop the flow of the chocolate.

13:40.213 --> 13:44.415
You fill the tray like this,

13:44.451 --> 13:47.085
and then you put it in
the cooling unit like this,

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
and there you go.

13:48.154 --> 13:49.187
All right, let's do this.

13:49.222 --> 13:51.022
All right, your turn.

13:51.057 --> 13:52.991
Now you show me.

13:56.663 --> 13:57.974
Okay then, that's...
that's enough.

13:57.998 --> 13:58.930
Try to keep it straight...

13:58.965 --> 14:01.199
Okay, you gotta be fast.

14:01.234 --> 14:02.166
A little bit faster.

14:02.202 --> 14:03.968
Okay, all right,
no, don't... don't...

14:04.004 --> 14:04.902
There we go.

14:04.938 --> 14:06.458
One tray at a time,
one tray at a time.

14:06.973 --> 14:07.973
Okay.

14:08.475 --> 14:09.652
No, no, don't pick it up,
don't pick it up.

14:09.676 --> 14:11.287
- All right...
- Okay, I'm just going to...

14:11.311 --> 14:12.610
Oh, no, don't pour it... okay.

14:12.645 --> 14:13.444
Nope, nope.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.979
You...

14:15.015 --> 14:19.584
You know what, maybe
we'll just start you off with,

14:19.619 --> 14:21.085
you know, something else.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.220
Something easier.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.456
Less messy.

14:41.474 --> 14:43.152
Why don't you pick up
the pace just a little?

14:43.176 --> 14:45.810
It's moving so fast,
it's stressful.

14:45.845 --> 14:46.978
You know what I like to say?

14:47.013 --> 14:48.413
Just go with the flow.

14:48.448 --> 14:50.014
Thanks, I'm trying.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.087
What are you wearing
on your feet?

14:56.122 --> 14:57.321
Aren't they cute?

14:57.357 --> 14:59.991
Honey, those are not
sensible work shoes.

15:03.029 --> 15:05.763
Oh my goodness, it has
been such a long day

15:05.799 --> 15:06.964
and I am exhausted.

15:07.834 --> 15:10.168
Girl, you're funny.
That's lunch.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.143
Where's your lunch?

15:19.179 --> 15:22.046
I didn't...

15:22.082 --> 15:24.315
What are you gonna eat?
Chocolate or marshmallows?

15:24.350 --> 15:26.951
Actually, that's my favourite
combo but it gets old quick.

15:26.986 --> 15:28.319
I usually eat out.

15:28.354 --> 15:29.787
I don't know how they do it
in Iowa,

15:29.823 --> 15:31.556
but we bring our own.

15:31.591 --> 15:32.957
Here, nothing special,

15:32.992 --> 15:34.403
but it's gonna get you
through the afternoon.

15:34.427 --> 15:36.727
Thank you, that's
very nice of you.

15:36.763 --> 15:38.362
Don't be so modest, Flo.

15:38.398 --> 15:40.665
You make the best ham and
swiss this side of Mt. Baker.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.532
Oh, stop.

15:41.568 --> 15:42.867
Ryan, this is Veronica.

15:42.902 --> 15:44.035
It's her first day.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.203
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:45.238 --> 15:46.637
We sort of met this morning...

15:46.673 --> 15:47.839
Yeah.

15:47.874 --> 15:49.173
We bumped into each other.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.842
I, saw that you were upset.

15:50.877 --> 15:53.811
I mean, I... I couldn't
help but overhear.

15:53.847 --> 15:57.181
Things have been...
challenging.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.217
Over the past year.

15:58.251 --> 15:59.283
How so?

15:59.319 --> 16:01.919
Ryan's not a big fan of
our new automated systems.

16:01.955 --> 16:04.155
I've been head chocolatier
and QC supervisor

16:04.190 --> 16:04.956
for the past eight years,

16:04.991 --> 16:07.058
and I can tell you
from experience

16:07.093 --> 16:08.860
that faster does not
always mean better,

16:08.895 --> 16:12.897
and quantity definitely
does not always mean quality.

16:12.932 --> 16:14.610
I'm sorry, it's just sometimes
I feel like management

16:14.634 --> 16:16.734
has no clue what actually
goes on around here.

16:16.769 --> 16:17.802
Here we go again.

16:17.837 --> 16:20.404
No, they sit up there
in their corporate towers,

16:20.440 --> 16:22.206
and they make decisions
about the very people

16:22.242 --> 16:23.686
who are making
their products for them,

16:23.710 --> 16:24.909
without ever consulting them.

16:24.944 --> 16:27.612
And then you have Carter Darren,
the director of operations.

16:27.647 --> 16:30.114
He comes down here what,
two times a year?

16:30.150 --> 16:33.751
And he doesn't even listen
to my ideas for new recipes.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.086
I just make what
they tell me to.

16:35.121 --> 16:38.189
I'm sure Carter is very busy

16:38.224 --> 16:40.424
and management, they... they
probably mean well, it's...

16:40.460 --> 16:41.959
I'm sorry, but who's side
are you on?

16:41.995 --> 16:43.227
Hey, you two.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.930
All I'm saying is just...
just once,

16:45.965 --> 16:47.143
could I have someone
from corporate

16:47.167 --> 16:50.368
other than Carter Darren to come
down here... a Cavendish,

16:50.403 --> 16:54.238
an actual, real Cavendish,
come down here,

16:54.274 --> 16:57.808
sit next to me face to face
and have a conversation.

16:57.844 --> 17:00.111
Is that too much to ask?

17:06.352 --> 17:10.054
And... it's your first day.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.333
And I'm putting
all of this on you.

17:11.357 --> 17:15.526
I should just be quiet
and eat my sandwich.

17:30.811 --> 17:31.710
Hi, dear.

17:31.745 --> 17:33.378
Hi, Lyla. Hi, Grant.

17:33.414 --> 17:34.414
Erin.

17:36.439 --> 17:38.617
<i>These Easter decorations
look great!</i>

17:38.652 --> 17:39.751
<i>So festive.</i>

17:39.787 --> 17:41.820
<i>They're for the
Sweetwater Easter Festival.</i>

17:41.856 --> 17:44.089
It's one of the most popular
events of the year.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.592
There's a pageant,
potato sack races,

17:46.627 --> 17:47.838
the big Easter egg hunt
for the kids.

17:47.862 --> 17:48.694
Yeah.

17:48.729 --> 17:50.963
That sounds wonderful.

17:50.998 --> 17:53.032
It is.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.267
So, how was your first day?

17:55.302 --> 17:57.836
How does "challenging" sound?

17:57.872 --> 17:59.104
Sounds about right.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.774
Yeah.

18:01.809 --> 18:04.610
Do you know someone named
Bryan who works in the factory?

18:04.645 --> 18:05.811
Bryan Bailey.

18:05.846 --> 18:07.594
Everyone knows Bryan.

18:07.815 --> 18:10.649
Nice fellow and struggling
a bit.

18:11.519 --> 18:13.819
His wife passed away
two years ago?

18:13.855 --> 18:15.421
Almost two and a half.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.089
He's finding his way back,
though.

18:17.124 --> 18:19.358
He has a lovely daughter,
Madison.

18:19.393 --> 18:21.427
That's good.

18:21.462 --> 18:23.429
I left you some
bubble bath upstairs

18:23.464 --> 18:25.297
if you wanna have a soak.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.465
Yes.

18:27.635 --> 18:29.268
Yes, yes, yes.

18:29.303 --> 18:30.336
Thank you.

18:30.371 --> 18:31.604
You're welcome, Erin.

18:31.639 --> 18:34.807
Or, are you still Veronica?

18:34.842 --> 18:38.110
Honestly at this point,
I have no idea.

18:38.145 --> 18:39.778
Good night.

18:44.752 --> 18:46.218
How was your first day, Erin?

18:46.254 --> 18:49.021
First day was a real
eye-opener, Dad.

18:49.056 --> 18:51.991
Well, Easter's the best time
to be there.

18:52.026 --> 18:53.325
What did you learn?

18:53.361 --> 18:55.561
That I can't keep up
with Buttery Bunnies,

18:55.596 --> 18:58.964
but that might be my fault, I
haven't quite mastered it yet.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.633
You'll get the hang of it.

19:00.668 --> 19:02.512
Although, I did learn that
one of the new machines

19:02.536 --> 19:04.236
might be compromising
the cocoa beans.

19:04.272 --> 19:06.805
It could be affecting the
quality of the chocolate.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.018
Well, that's why you're there.

19:08.042 --> 19:09.042
Keep listening.

19:09.076 --> 19:10.009
<i>That's what I'm doing,</i>

19:10.044 --> 19:12.478
<i>learning from the ground floor,
literally.</i>

19:12.513 --> 19:14.980
That's where you started out,
right Dad?

19:15.016 --> 19:16.660
What was your first day like
in the factory

19:16.684 --> 19:18.017
when you were younger?

19:18.052 --> 19:19.985
A total disaster.

19:21.789 --> 19:23.856
<i>So you're in fine company, darlin'.</i>

19:25.860 --> 19:27.927
So... I was thinking
that the Buttery Bunny line

19:27.962 --> 19:29.828
may not be your cup of tea.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.898
So maybe working on the Easter
baskets would be a better fit.

19:32.934 --> 19:34.066
Bryan will train you,

19:34.101 --> 19:36.936
he's supervising our new basket
assembly machines, so...

19:36.971 --> 19:39.004
I'm not sure if you know
this, but I...

19:39.040 --> 19:42.174
I don't think that Bryan and I
really get along.

19:42.209 --> 19:43.442
Well, like I said yesterday...

19:46.781 --> 19:51.083
Like I said yesterday,
we are one big family here.

19:51.118 --> 19:52.952
We have to learn
to work together,

19:52.987 --> 19:54.119
no matter our differences.

19:55.790 --> 19:56.922
Persistent.

19:59.493 --> 20:00.592
Do you mind if...

20:00.628 --> 20:01.860
It's okay, go ahead.

20:01.896 --> 20:02.761
Thanks.

20:02.797 --> 20:03.762
Hi, I can't talk right now.

20:03.798 --> 20:05.142
Carter has been asking
for you since yesterday,

20:05.166 --> 20:06.732
and I'm running out of excuses.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.567
Well, tell him I went
to a breakfast meeting,

20:08.602 --> 20:09.768
er, er, brunch.

20:09.804 --> 20:12.071
Brunch is better.

20:12.106 --> 20:15.040
But your car's still here.

20:15.076 --> 20:16.775
I took an Uber.
Gotta go. Bye.

20:16.811 --> 20:20.045
Sorry about that.

20:20.081 --> 20:21.480
Where were we?

20:21.515 --> 20:24.650
You and Bryan.
Working together.

20:24.685 --> 20:26.318
Right.

20:26.354 --> 20:27.953
Are you sure that's a good idea?

20:27.989 --> 20:32.624
I thought of it,
so it must be good.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.426
Have an egg.

20:43.537 --> 20:45.604
Reporting for Easter
basket duty.

20:45.639 --> 20:48.407
Yes. So I heard.

20:48.442 --> 20:51.276
So, you're not supervising
the ingredients today?

20:51.312 --> 20:54.646
No, looks like my department
doesn't need me as much lately.

20:54.682 --> 20:56.682
But in my capacity as
quality control manager,

20:56.717 --> 20:59.118
I'm in charge of Easter basket
oversight.

21:03.057 --> 21:04.990
Look, we got off on the wrong
foot the other day,

21:05.026 --> 21:05.924
and I was really hoping

21:05.960 --> 21:07.626
that maybe we could get
on the right one.

21:07.661 --> 21:09.194
I would like that.

21:09.230 --> 21:11.830
Okay then. Come here.

21:11.866 --> 21:13.365
This is our newest addition.

21:13.401 --> 21:15.000
It assembles our Easter baskets
for us,

21:15.036 --> 21:16.546
<i>meant to do the work of
a dozen employees.</i>

21:16.570 --> 21:17.469
<i>I see.</i>

21:17.505 --> 21:20.672
And this is Murray,
manning the station.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.041
Not one of our newest additions.

21:23.077 --> 21:25.177
Pleasure to meet you, Murray.
I'm Veronica.

21:25.212 --> 21:26.278
Nice to meet you.

21:26.313 --> 21:29.148
Murray's been with the company
for... how long now?

21:29.183 --> 21:32.451
Let's just say longer
than any machines here.

21:32.486 --> 21:33.986
Now, Murray is a true craftsman.

21:34.021 --> 21:35.565
He's actually responsible
for some of Cavendish's

21:35.589 --> 21:39.391
most famous handcrafted
chocolates over the years.

21:39.427 --> 21:43.195
Well, so, what do you think
of this new system?

21:43.230 --> 21:46.398
The machine doesn't know,
it doesn't look right.

21:46.434 --> 21:47.699
How so?

21:47.735 --> 21:49.968
It's the same Easter basket,
isn't it?

21:52.873 --> 21:54.940
Come here. Let me
show you something.

21:57.411 --> 21:59.411
There's just no substitute
for a Cavendish basket

21:59.447 --> 22:01.580
assembled by hand.

22:01.615 --> 22:03.682
And Murray here,
he's the master.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.853
And here you go.

22:09.723 --> 22:11.223
It's stunning.

22:11.258 --> 22:13.425
Now, which one would you
rather buy?

22:13.461 --> 22:16.328
The one Murray made, or
the one the machine made?

22:16.363 --> 22:18.230
It's no comparison.

22:20.935 --> 22:22.334
You wanna try one?

22:22.369 --> 22:23.569
It's fun.

22:23.604 --> 22:27.005
Okay, sure.

22:30.478 --> 22:32.578
So, does the supervisor
just supervise,

22:32.613 --> 22:34.046
or does he lead by example?

22:35.116 --> 22:36.215
Just curious.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.350
Are you asking me to make
an Easter basket, Miss...

22:38.385 --> 22:40.285
I don't know your last name.

22:40.321 --> 22:41.453
It's Ca...

22:42.823 --> 22:43.789
Do you need something for that?

22:43.824 --> 22:46.024
Sorry, it's just dry in here,
it's Erinson.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.392
I'm Veronica Erinson.

22:47.428 --> 22:50.529
Well, Miss Veronica Erinson,
today,

22:50.564 --> 22:52.431
I will lead by example.

22:52.466 --> 22:55.934
So the bunny goes in the centre,

22:55.970 --> 23:00.305
then we'll grab some chocolate
eggs and sprinkle them all over,

23:00.341 --> 23:02.074
just kind of let them fall
like that.

23:02.109 --> 23:03.208
And then some toy eggs?

23:03.244 --> 23:04.109
That's right.

23:04.145 --> 23:05.544
On the sides.

23:05.579 --> 23:08.547
Don't forget the chick pops.

23:08.582 --> 23:11.216
Don't forget the carrots
for the bunny.

23:11.252 --> 23:12.718
That's right.

23:12.753 --> 23:15.287
Flowers.

23:15.322 --> 23:16.421
As old fashioned as it is,

23:16.457 --> 23:17.667
I like the Cavendish
Easter basket.

23:17.691 --> 23:19.324
I always have.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.192
Me too.

23:20.227 --> 23:22.060
But the bunny ties it
all together.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.729
Personally, I think
it's one of the best

23:23.764 --> 23:25.564
milk chocolate products
that we have.

23:25.599 --> 23:26.665
Really?

23:26.700 --> 23:27.966
Yeah.

23:28.002 --> 23:29.434
And I have my PhD in chocolate.

23:29.470 --> 23:30.802
From Chocolate University?

23:30.838 --> 23:32.504
Yes, Chocolate University,
that's right.

23:34.308 --> 23:36.842
Actually, I went to culinary
school in Oregon.

23:36.877 --> 23:38.944
And now you work in chocolate?

23:38.979 --> 23:42.514
Well, it was at school
that I fell in love with it.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.750
Growing up here you kind of
take it for granted,

23:44.785 --> 23:49.755
but at school, I saw chocolate
in a whole different light.

23:49.790 --> 23:52.291
The artistry of it,

23:52.326 --> 23:55.294
the creativity and
the craftsmanship.

23:55.329 --> 23:59.902
To be able to create something
of... pure beauty.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.604
That's chocolate to me.

24:05.639 --> 24:08.507
Beauty to all the senses.

24:08.542 --> 24:13.753
Touch, sight, smell,

24:15.549 --> 24:17.182
and sound.

24:17.218 --> 24:20.018
Sound?

24:35.569 --> 24:38.036
Do you want to try another one?

24:38.072 --> 24:40.072
Sure.

24:40.107 --> 24:41.940
Yeah.

24:49.684 --> 24:51.117
This food is delicious.

24:54.021 --> 24:55.487
I've been meaning to ask you.

24:55.523 --> 24:57.323
What was it like working
with my dad?

24:57.358 --> 24:59.024
Foster? Hard worker.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.927
Eager to know every aspect
of the factory.

25:01.963 --> 25:03.774
That's why he was the natural
choice to take over the company

25:03.798 --> 25:06.599
when your granddad passed away.

25:06.634 --> 25:09.468
I never really got to know
my grandpa.

25:09.503 --> 25:11.704
Before Mr. Cavendish
opened the factory,

25:11.739 --> 25:13.372
he had this little cart,

25:13.407 --> 25:15.875
and he sold chocolate
door to door.

25:15.910 --> 25:19.478
He was so happy to see the kids
with their smiling faces.

25:19.513 --> 25:21.814
Two of those smiles were ours.

25:21.849 --> 25:23.449
Your granddad knew way back then

25:23.484 --> 25:25.651
that chocolate is more
than the taste.

25:25.686 --> 25:28.187
It's about being a part of
people's lives,

25:28.222 --> 25:31.457
their families and traditions.

25:31.492 --> 25:33.659
It's about making memories.

25:33.694 --> 25:35.294
Too bad they don't make
the legendary

25:35.329 --> 25:38.297
Cavendish Eggs anymore,
now that was something.

25:38.332 --> 25:41.233
We were having that chocolate
on our first date, right hun?

25:41.269 --> 25:43.235
You bet.

25:43.271 --> 25:45.204
I remember those.

25:45.239 --> 25:46.805
I used to love them
as a little girl.

25:46.841 --> 25:50.242
They were so big and
beautifully painted,

25:50.278 --> 25:53.846
with all those coloured
jellybeans and...

25:53.881 --> 25:55.981
they were a real work of art.

25:56.017 --> 25:57.516
With a surprise toy inside.

25:57.551 --> 25:59.885
Yes!

25:59.921 --> 26:03.222
I haven't seen one in forever.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.691
But I'm embarrassed to ask,
but why did,

26:05.726 --> 26:07.526
why did they stop making them?

26:07.561 --> 26:09.762
They were made meticulously
by hand.

26:09.797 --> 26:11.030
Took too much time.

26:11.065 --> 26:12.431
And things have changed.

26:12.466 --> 26:14.266
The market has changed.

26:14.302 --> 26:17.403
We have a plastic replica
on display at the museum.

26:17.438 --> 26:18.504
You know, we're hosting

26:18.539 --> 26:20.839
an Easter egg decorating class
there this weekend.

26:20.875 --> 26:23.275
Why don't you stop by.

26:23.311 --> 26:25.144
Maybe I will.

26:32.553 --> 26:34.353
So the file marked
"Easter Rollout?"

26:34.388 --> 26:36.133
Yes, just go ahead and
forward it to everyone,

26:36.157 --> 26:37.256
with my usual closing.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.559
And can you email me some
options for office chairs?

26:40.594 --> 26:41.860
Good ones.

26:41.896 --> 26:43.796
Well, I'll tell you
about it later.

26:43.831 --> 26:45.030
I... I have to go right now,

26:45.066 --> 26:49.601
I am actually about to visit
the Cavendish chocolate museum.

26:49.637 --> 26:50.402
I love that place.

26:50.438 --> 26:51.715
Two years ago, I visited
with my...

26:51.739 --> 26:52.739
Hey, Parker.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.406
You work on weekends too?

26:54.442 --> 26:57.076
Yeah, sometimes there's
just too much to catch up on.

26:57.111 --> 26:59.378
Yes, too much.
Way too much.

26:59.413 --> 27:01.447
Did you give Erin my message?
Have you seen her?

27:01.482 --> 27:03.415
She's gone.
Marketing conference.

27:03.451 --> 27:05.551
I didn't hear anything.

27:05.586 --> 27:08.120
Super last minute.

27:08.155 --> 27:09.555
That's not her on the phone,
is it?

27:09.590 --> 27:11.123
It's my mom, dad.

27:11.158 --> 27:12.324
My parents.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.159
I'm talking to my parents.

27:14.195 --> 27:17.429
You know, did she say anything
about display graphics?

27:17.465 --> 27:20.132
Something about
display graphics.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.734
Tell him I went
with pink and blue.

27:21.769 --> 27:22.769
You know.

27:22.803 --> 27:23.981
I think she said something
about pink and blue.

27:24.005 --> 27:26.105
She did. Great.

27:26.140 --> 27:28.107
Thank you.

27:28.142 --> 27:29.508
<i>You're doing great, Parker.</i>

27:29.543 --> 27:31.010
<i>Thanks for everything.</i>

27:31.045 --> 27:32.878
That was stressful.

28:36.010 --> 28:37.409
You like what you see?

28:37.445 --> 28:40.412
I didn't mean
to scare you.

28:40.448 --> 28:44.316
No, it's fine, I was just...
looking at the egg.

28:44.351 --> 28:45.884
What do you think?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
I wish I could see a real one.

28:47.955 --> 28:50.189
I was thinking the same thing.

28:50.224 --> 28:51.334
Anyways, if you're wondering why

28:51.358 --> 28:53.203
a grown man is carrying
little jars of paint around...

28:53.227 --> 28:56.428
No, no. I... I think
it's a charming look.

28:56.464 --> 28:58.897
I'm actually here for
the egg decorating class.

28:58.933 --> 28:59.765
Great.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.100
That's why I'm here.

29:01.135 --> 29:01.900
Really?

29:01.936 --> 29:03.001
Yeah.

29:03.037 --> 29:05.270
Just through that door.

29:19.753 --> 29:21.253
This is great.

29:21.288 --> 29:24.389
Meet all of our modern-day
Michelangelos.

29:29.597 --> 29:30.696
How's it going, sweetie?

29:30.731 --> 29:32.231
- Good, Dad.
- Yeah?

29:32.266 --> 29:33.966
That looks good.

29:34.001 --> 29:36.268
Veronica, this is my daughter,
Madison.

29:36.303 --> 29:37.402
Hi Veronica.

29:37.438 --> 29:38.570
Hi, Madison.

29:38.606 --> 29:39.471
It's nice to meet you.

29:39.507 --> 29:40.906
I'm covered in paint.

29:40.941 --> 29:41.773
I can see that.

29:41.809 --> 29:43.909
You look like you've been hard
at work.

29:43.944 --> 29:46.056
You can tell an artist is
at work by the amount of paint

29:46.080 --> 29:48.447
that's not on the canvas.

29:48.482 --> 29:49.781
Or the egg.

29:51.352 --> 29:53.085
What do you guys think
of my egg?

29:53.120 --> 29:54.431
I think it's absolutely great, hun.

29:54.455 --> 29:55.455
Yeah, I love it.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.489
Yeah, the colours remind me
of spring flowers.

29:57.525 --> 29:59.958
I wanted to put a butterfly
in the middle,

29:59.994 --> 30:02.761
but I'm not the best
at drawing them.

30:02.796 --> 30:03.962
Well, could I help you?

30:03.998 --> 30:06.131
Yeah, sure.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.000
Okay.

30:08.035 --> 30:09.334
What colour?

30:09.370 --> 30:10.435
Should we do purple?

30:10.471 --> 30:12.571
Yeah.

30:12.606 --> 30:14.106
Okay. Here we go.

30:14.141 --> 30:15.774
Butterflies are my favourite.

30:15.809 --> 30:16.975
Mine too.

30:17.011 --> 30:18.477
Because they're pretty?

30:18.512 --> 30:21.079
That, and because they start out
as one thing...

30:21.115 --> 30:23.115
And then end up
as something else.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.349
Exactly.

30:24.385 --> 30:26.285
A beautiful butterfly.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.786
That one has glitter in it.

30:27.821 --> 30:29.621
Well then, we have
to use that one.

30:29.657 --> 30:30.622
Yeah.

30:30.658 --> 30:31.823
Beautiful.

30:31.859 --> 30:33.292
So, did you have fun, Maddie?

30:33.327 --> 30:34.626
Sure did.

30:34.662 --> 30:35.961
And did you have fun, Veronica?

30:35.996 --> 30:37.129
Sure did.

30:37.164 --> 30:38.730
Hey, Erin?

30:41.869 --> 30:43.402
Veronica!

30:44.305 --> 30:46.271
Veronica?

30:46.307 --> 30:47.639
I think she's talking to you.

30:49.043 --> 30:51.310
Come see this.

30:51.345 --> 30:53.478
It looks so good.

30:53.514 --> 30:54.646
It sure does.

30:54.682 --> 30:56.348
I want one.

30:56.383 --> 30:57.661
Well, we don't make those
anymore sweetie.

30:57.685 --> 30:58.951
We had to retire them.

30:58.986 --> 30:59.851
Why?

30:59.887 --> 31:01.553
Well, sometimes the world
moves too fast

31:01.589 --> 31:03.956
and people just want
things right away.

31:03.991 --> 31:06.058
But it's so beautiful.

31:06.093 --> 31:07.793
Can't argue with that.

31:19.740 --> 31:20.639
Ms. Enwright?

31:20.674 --> 31:22.174
You wanted to see me?

31:22.209 --> 31:24.576
Yes, please, come in, sit down.

31:24.612 --> 31:27.546
If this is about me sampling
the chocolates, I was...

31:27.581 --> 31:28.680
That's not why you're here.

31:28.716 --> 31:31.416
Saturday is the annual
Sweetwater Chocolate Exchange.

31:31.452 --> 31:34.086
It's a time when people around
town and the surrounding areas

31:34.121 --> 31:35.921
get together and
share each other's

31:35.956 --> 31:38.056
homemade spring
themed chocolate.

31:38.092 --> 31:40.025
And there's an egg relay
for the kids.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.093
That sounds great.

31:41.128 --> 31:43.061
Cavendish sponsors the events,

31:43.097 --> 31:45.063
so I need two employees
to walk around

31:45.099 --> 31:48.000
and represent the company
and hand out chocolate.

31:48.035 --> 31:50.836
Flo is one, she has a flair
for these things,

31:50.871 --> 31:53.572
and she requested you
to join her.

31:53.607 --> 31:54.740
Me?

31:54.775 --> 31:57.576
Is there another Veronica
Erinson I don't know about?

32:02.983 --> 32:04.249
So, what do you say?

32:04.285 --> 32:06.685
Yes. Count me in.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.053
Good.

32:15.430 --> 32:16.896
Hi.

32:16.931 --> 32:19.198
Try a caramel cluster,
you'll love it.

32:19.233 --> 32:21.634
Hi.

32:21.669 --> 32:23.169
This is so exciting.

32:23.204 --> 32:25.204
My first Sweetwater Chocolate
Exchange.

32:25.239 --> 32:26.472
You'll love it.

32:26.507 --> 32:27.873
Hi.

32:30.778 --> 32:31.844
What are they doing here?

32:32.880 --> 32:34.692
Chaz and Trent, they're
the owners of Chocmate,

32:34.716 --> 32:36.549
this trendy new
chocolate company.

32:36.584 --> 32:38.350
I see them on social media.

32:38.386 --> 32:40.519
That's our pecan prosciutto.

32:40.555 --> 32:42.054
Well, everybody from Sweetwater

32:42.090 --> 32:44.056
and surrounding areas
are welcome.

32:44.092 --> 32:44.957
Their factory is an hour away,

32:44.992 --> 32:47.159
I guess that counts
as "surrounding".

32:47.195 --> 32:48.839
Ladies and gentlemen, these are
gonna be the best chocolates

32:48.863 --> 32:50.062
you've ever had in your life.

32:50.098 --> 32:51.664
They're really good with people.

32:51.699 --> 32:53.699
Please, give it a try.
Excellent.

32:55.269 --> 32:57.036
Watch this.

33:00.942 --> 33:01.841
Hey, Betty.

33:01.876 --> 33:03.109
Ladies, hi!

33:03.144 --> 33:06.045
How are you ladies doing on this
beautiful Sweetwater afternoon?

33:06.080 --> 33:07.046
Good, thank you.

33:07.081 --> 33:08.380
You need to try this.

33:08.416 --> 33:10.416
It's from our new
spring mint collection.

33:10.451 --> 33:11.784
Mint isn't really my cup of tea.

33:11.819 --> 33:13.252
Me neither, to be honest.

33:13.287 --> 33:14.920
Sometimes it can be
pretty strong,

33:14.956 --> 33:19.125
but a Cavendish mint is subtle
like a soft spring breeze.

33:21.062 --> 33:22.261
A breeze, you said?

33:22.296 --> 33:23.896
A breeze.

33:30.505 --> 33:31.505
What did I tell you?

33:32.907 --> 33:34.740
Help yourselves.

33:34.776 --> 33:35.776
<i>Have that one there.</i>

33:35.810 --> 33:36.776
Thank you!

33:36.811 --> 33:37.710
Bye, ladies.

33:37.745 --> 33:39.745
Bye.

33:39.781 --> 33:40.924
Flo, you are a natural
with people.

33:40.948 --> 33:42.548
You should be in sales.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.450
Thanks, but honestly I've tried.

33:44.485 --> 33:45.729
I applied to corporate
a few times,

33:45.753 --> 33:48.487
but heard nothing back.

33:48.523 --> 33:50.422
That doesn't seem right.

33:52.293 --> 33:53.293
Hey.

33:53.861 --> 33:54.861
Hey.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.830
Madison is playing
with some friends,

33:57.865 --> 34:00.065
so I was going to walk around,

34:00.101 --> 34:03.169
sample some of the wares
of our fellow chocolatiers.

34:03.204 --> 34:04.603
You wanna join?

34:05.473 --> 34:07.339
I think he's talking
to you, girl.

34:07.375 --> 34:10.074
I can handle flying solo.

34:10.110 --> 34:14.013
No corporate talk, I promise.

34:14.047 --> 34:15.313
Okay.

34:17.051 --> 34:20.319
Shall we?

34:29.330 --> 34:31.697
Okay, now, these are Miss
Gillingham's spring chickens.

34:31.732 --> 34:35.835
Now, they are world famous
in Sweetwater.

34:35.870 --> 34:38.237
She switches up the ingredients
every year.

34:43.710 --> 34:46.445
I'm getting creme de cacao,
a little bit of orange zest,

34:46.480 --> 34:49.815
and just a... just a flutter
of amaretto.

34:49.851 --> 34:51.717
You got all that from one bite?

34:51.752 --> 34:52.717
You just need to open up
your heart,

34:52.753 --> 34:55.120
and listen to what the
chocolate's telling you.

34:55.156 --> 34:56.487
It's that easy?

34:56.524 --> 34:58.023
That's what Gabriel Belanger
says.

34:58.059 --> 34:59.391
The chocolatier?

34:59.427 --> 35:02.995
One of the world's
best chocolatiers.

35:03.030 --> 35:04.908
It's always been a dream of mine
to go to Switzerland

35:04.932 --> 35:07.366
and study with him
at his school.

35:07.401 --> 35:08.667
It's never too late.

35:08.703 --> 35:10.069
Maybe.

35:10.104 --> 35:13.706
This is old Bill Wallham's
recipe.

35:13.741 --> 35:16.508
Your turn.

35:16.544 --> 35:17.743
No, no, no, no.

35:17.778 --> 35:19.545
You have to close your eyes.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.847
It helps focus your taste buds.

35:27.288 --> 35:28.387
Okay, so you're getting...

35:29.624 --> 35:33.025
I'm trying to open my heart
and listen to the chocolate.

35:36.297 --> 35:39.899
I'm getting strong notes of...
chocolate.

35:41.569 --> 35:42.601
Very funny.

35:42.637 --> 35:45.871
Just trust your senses.

35:45.907 --> 35:48.140
Trust what you're feeling.

35:55.049 --> 35:56.749
There's a touch of...

35:56.784 --> 35:58.250
Touch of what?

35:58.286 --> 36:01.453
It's like, a smokiness?

36:01.489 --> 36:03.455
Yeah.

36:03.491 --> 36:05.457
That's the chipotle.

36:05.493 --> 36:06.525
Really?

36:06.560 --> 36:08.560
It's his trademark.

36:08.596 --> 36:14.533
See, all you had to do was just
trust your feelings.

36:14.568 --> 36:16.602
Okay, everyone.

36:16.637 --> 36:19.238
Time for the Easter relay game.

36:19.273 --> 36:20.739
Gather out back.

36:23.477 --> 36:25.711
On your marks...

36:25.746 --> 36:27.379
She looks so excited.

36:27.415 --> 36:28.480
She is.

36:28.516 --> 36:29.481
Get set!

36:29.517 --> 36:30.661
We've been practicing at home.

36:30.685 --> 36:31.685
Go!

36:35.523 --> 36:37.723
Yeah, you can do it!

36:40.594 --> 36:42.528
Okay, you got it!

36:45.800 --> 36:47.566
Come on, Maddie!

36:47.601 --> 36:49.268
Here ya go, honey!

36:49.303 --> 36:50.769
Come on Maddie!

36:57.945 --> 37:00.512
Get it, get it, get it!

37:00.548 --> 37:01.548
Get it, get it!

37:04.385 --> 37:05.484
Daddy, how did I do?

37:05.519 --> 37:06.986
You did amazing, sweetheart.

37:07.021 --> 37:09.254
I finished second,
it was so much fun.

37:09.290 --> 37:11.590
That was so exciting!

37:11.625 --> 37:12.424
Great job.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.359
Thanks.

37:13.394 --> 37:14.604
I'm gonna take Madison
for some iced tea,

37:14.628 --> 37:15.594
if that's okay.

37:15.629 --> 37:16.762
Yeah, that'd be great.

37:16.797 --> 37:18.263
Way to go, hun.

37:18.299 --> 37:19.798
It was so much fun!

37:20.901 --> 37:24.737
<i>I was like that
far away from winning.</i>

37:26.307 --> 37:29.508
That was intense.
Fun, but intense.

37:29.543 --> 37:34.947
Yeah. An egg, spoon, a race.

37:34.982 --> 37:40.519
Sometimes the best things
are the simplest.

37:40.554 --> 37:43.622
I really like it here.

37:43.657 --> 37:45.824
Is it your first time
in Sweetwater?

37:45.860 --> 37:46.959
I was here when I was 10,

37:46.994 --> 37:49.661
but we were just
passing through.

37:49.697 --> 37:53.032
Well, it's a great place
to grow up, raise a family.

37:56.270 --> 38:00.639
Bryan... I heard about
your wife.

38:00.674 --> 38:02.975
I'm sorry.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.743
Thank you.

38:04.779 --> 38:07.679
I've been very fortunate to have
such a supportive family

38:07.715 --> 38:13.685
and community, so I feel like
I'm starting to turn a corner.

38:13.721 --> 38:15.888
I was lucky to meet her too,
though.

38:15.923 --> 38:17.200
You always hope that
you just find someone

38:17.224 --> 38:18.991
that brings out the best in you.

38:19.026 --> 38:22.628
Gives you that spark,
that trust.

38:26.734 --> 38:28.333
I hope I'm not getting
too personal.

38:28.369 --> 38:30.669
No, I don't, I don't mind.

38:32.907 --> 38:34.573
Now, what about you?

38:34.608 --> 38:37.876
What's that saying,
what's your story?

38:37.912 --> 38:38.777
My story?

38:38.813 --> 38:42.781
I'm... I'm not
that interesting.

38:42.817 --> 38:44.716
I might disagree with you.

38:48.956 --> 38:52.558
Where do I start?

38:52.593 --> 38:54.293
How about at the beginning?

38:54.328 --> 38:57.062
Yeah, that makes sense.

38:57.098 --> 39:00.299
I was born in Seattle, and
I don't know if this is true,

39:00.334 --> 39:02.634
but apparently on the day
that I was born,

39:02.670 --> 39:04.970
it rained so much that it broke
the Seattle record

39:05.005 --> 39:06.805
for most rain in one day.

39:06.841 --> 39:07.973
Really?

39:09.076 --> 39:10.175
That's a lot of rain.

39:10.211 --> 39:12.544
When I was little, my mom
would tell me that it was

39:12.580 --> 39:15.948
a good sign because I just had
to shine a little bit brighter

39:15.983 --> 39:18.717
to get through the clouds.

39:18.752 --> 39:22.054
That's nice.

39:22.089 --> 39:25.757
I was raised in Seattle and
then I went away for college.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.326
Chocolate University?

39:27.361 --> 39:28.927
I applied but I didn't get in.

39:31.198 --> 39:33.665
I went to college,
on the East Coast.

39:33.701 --> 39:36.735
And after school, I...

39:36.770 --> 39:39.605
I tried a few different jobs,
different cities,

39:39.640 --> 39:45.444
but I never really got attached
to anything, or anyone.

39:45.479 --> 39:47.980
Still finding yourself?
That's all right.

39:48.015 --> 39:52.317
My dad kept nudging me to join
the family business,

39:52.353 --> 39:55.187
but I just, I wasn't sure
if it was right for me.

39:55.222 --> 39:57.789
I... I wanted to be
my own person,

39:57.825 --> 39:59.158
make my own path, but...

39:59.193 --> 40:00.537
it's kind of hard to make
your own path

40:00.561 --> 40:02.828
when you don't know
where you're going.

40:02.863 --> 40:04.096
I can relate.

40:04.131 --> 40:07.266
You know, right now it might not
seem like it's your dream job,

40:07.301 --> 40:10.836
but maybe it's just a stepping
stone to something else.

40:10.871 --> 40:12.838
You are meant to be here.

40:12.873 --> 40:15.107
I truly believe that.

40:17.912 --> 40:19.444
Hey, guys.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.624
Can I Interest you
in a chocolate?

40:20.648 --> 40:22.459
Bryan, right?
Head chocolatier at Cavendish?

40:22.483 --> 40:24.561
We met at the chocolate
convention in Spokane last year.

40:24.585 --> 40:26.952
Right. Chaz and Trent.

40:26.987 --> 40:29.021
I'm Trent, he's Chaz.

40:29.056 --> 40:30.100
Sorry. It's nice to meet
you guys again,

40:30.124 --> 40:32.724
you're doing some interesting
things over there.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.692
Is that a compliment?

40:33.727 --> 40:34.693
Not sure, can't tell.

40:34.728 --> 40:36.562
This is my friend, Veronica.

40:36.597 --> 40:37.996
We work together at the factory.

40:38.032 --> 40:38.997
Nice to meet you.

40:39.033 --> 40:40.632
So, care to try?

40:40.668 --> 40:42.534
This one's called
"Spring Heat".

40:42.570 --> 40:44.648
No, I've already tried
that one, it's got a lot of...

40:44.672 --> 40:45.504
I'll try it.

40:45.539 --> 40:47.139
I've been learning a lot
about chocolate.

40:48.676 --> 40:50.342
...habanero peppers.

40:55.616 --> 40:56.715
You okay?

40:56.750 --> 40:58.150
I'll be right over.

41:05.259 --> 41:06.291
Listen, Bryan.

41:06.327 --> 41:07.226
We actually came to the exchange
for a few reasons.

41:07.261 --> 41:09.328
We're looking for a new
head chocolatier.

41:09.363 --> 41:10.840
We can't do everything
ourselves anymore.

41:10.864 --> 41:12.531
Our new VP said you'd be
a great choice.

41:12.566 --> 41:13.532
Very artistic.

41:13.567 --> 41:15.701
Right. You mean the VP
that you poached,

41:15.736 --> 41:17.035
and now you're going for two?

41:17.071 --> 41:18.871
Like a good chocolate,
can't stop at just one.

41:18.906 --> 41:20.939
We'd offer you almost
complete creative control.

41:20.975 --> 41:23.108
We're new, but we like being
in first place.

41:23.143 --> 41:24.409
Second just doesn't cut it.

41:24.445 --> 41:25.310
And let's face it,

41:25.346 --> 41:27.012
the Cavendishes are living
in the past.

41:27.047 --> 41:27.946
We look to the future.

41:27.982 --> 41:30.515
Call us sometime,
but don't wait too long.

41:51.573 --> 41:53.739
Hey.

41:53.775 --> 41:55.274
Is everything okay?

41:55.310 --> 41:57.276
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:57.312 --> 41:58.811
How are you?

41:58.847 --> 42:01.914
I have never drank so much
iced tea in my entire life.

42:01.950 --> 42:04.584
But I think the fire is
finally out.

42:04.619 --> 42:05.619
Daddy?

42:05.653 --> 42:06.886
Can you ask her?

42:06.921 --> 42:08.120
About the petting zoo?

42:08.156 --> 42:09.789
She has been wanting
to tell you...

42:09.824 --> 42:13.326
Did you know that our very own
Madison Bailey

42:13.361 --> 42:15.228
has landed the coveted role
as Easter Bunny

42:15.263 --> 42:17.830
in the Easter festival pageant?

42:17.866 --> 42:19.298
What? That's amazing.

42:19.334 --> 42:20.399
Congratulations.

42:20.435 --> 42:21.801
I need to work on my hop.

42:21.836 --> 42:24.737
She wants to do some
character research.

42:24.772 --> 42:26.772
Yes.
At the petting zoo tomorrow.

42:26.808 --> 42:29.275
So, will you come too?

42:29.310 --> 42:30.510
I would love to.

42:30.545 --> 42:32.812
We're all gonna have
so much fun.

42:49.998 --> 42:51.330
She's really getting in there.

42:51.366 --> 42:53.499
I think she's trying a method
acting approach.

42:53.535 --> 42:55.668
Pretty soon she'll be eating
nothing but carrots.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.970
Daddy, I won't be
eating carrots.

42:58.006 --> 42:59.672
Everybody knows bunny rabbits

42:59.707 --> 43:01.274
eat mostly grass and hay.

43:01.309 --> 43:02.341
I have been educated.

43:02.377 --> 43:03.776
Schooled, as they say.

43:03.811 --> 43:06.145
Right.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.559
Are you planning on going to the
Easter festival at town square?

43:08.583 --> 43:11.183
This year I volunteered to be
the egg hunt Grand Marshal.

43:12.921 --> 43:16.322
Hey. It is a big responsibility.

43:16.357 --> 43:20.293
I hadn't really thought
that far ahead.

43:25.266 --> 43:26.299
Is it okay?

43:26.334 --> 43:27.199
Very proud of you, honey.

43:27.235 --> 43:28.734
You're gonna knock it
out of the park.

43:28.770 --> 43:31.037
I still have to finish
my costume.

43:31.072 --> 43:33.472
She's making her own
bunny costume from scratch.

43:33.508 --> 43:34.840
No shortcuts for
this little girl.

43:34.876 --> 43:36.976
Veronica, will you help me
finish it?

43:37.011 --> 43:38.177
It's just the ears and tail.

43:38.212 --> 43:39.712
Maddie!

43:39.747 --> 43:41.013
The most important part.

43:41.049 --> 43:41.881
That's true.

43:41.916 --> 43:43.916
Daddy's great at almost
everything...

43:43.952 --> 43:45.518
Except for sewing?

43:45.553 --> 43:47.320
I didn't say it.

43:47.355 --> 43:48.254
Look, Veronica, you don't...

43:48.289 --> 43:50.222
I have done plenty of sewing
in my time.

43:50.258 --> 43:52.358
I would love to.

43:52.393 --> 43:53.393
Yes!

43:54.629 --> 43:56.562
Look, Daddy.
They have goats.

44:02.403 --> 44:03.903
I saw that.

44:12.246 --> 44:13.613
Good morning.

44:13.648 --> 44:14.914
Morning.

44:14.949 --> 44:17.750
Morning Flo.

44:17.785 --> 44:20.386
I've never seen somebody
so happy to go to work.

44:20.421 --> 44:23.356
Well, it's spring, and
everything's in bloom.

44:26.127 --> 44:27.693
<i>So, automation seems
to be going well.</i>

44:28.963 --> 44:30.730
<i>Love the new designs, they pop.</i>

44:32.900 --> 44:35.434
I want you two to meet someone.

44:36.671 --> 44:39.071
Don't be so shy.

44:39.107 --> 44:40.139
Carter Darren.

44:40.174 --> 44:42.541
<i>Director of operations
at Cavendish in Seattle.</i>

44:42.577 --> 44:44.477
<i>He tours the facility
a few times a year,</i>

44:44.512 --> 44:46.412
but today was a surprise.

44:46.447 --> 44:48.280
Yes. A little impromptu visit.

44:48.316 --> 44:51.283
Just seeing if things are ship
shape for our Easter roll out.

44:51.319 --> 44:53.753
Big day is less than
a month away.

44:53.788 --> 44:55.087
This is Florence Baker.

44:55.123 --> 44:57.590
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

44:57.625 --> 45:00.693
And, this is Veronica Erinson.

45:04.532 --> 45:05.965
What are you doing?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.466
Organizing box...

45:08.703 --> 45:09.535
Please, Veronica.

45:09.570 --> 45:11.804
<i>I would like you to meet Carter.</i>

45:13.374 --> 45:14.740
Wait, Carter Darren?

45:14.776 --> 45:16.442
The Carter Darren?

45:16.477 --> 45:17.276
Erin?

45:17.311 --> 45:18.144
...son.

45:18.179 --> 45:19.145
Yes.

45:19.180 --> 45:20.146
I'm Veronica Erinson.

45:20.181 --> 45:21.080
Wait.

45:21.115 --> 45:22.115
You're here?

45:23.117 --> 45:24.316
She's a transfer from Iowa.

45:24.352 --> 45:27.119
I really admire some of the
things you've implemented here.

45:27.155 --> 45:29.488
That buttery bunny machine
is a dream,

45:29.524 --> 45:33.192
but the Easter basket machines,
they have some problems.

45:33.227 --> 45:35.494
Sorry, I'm... I'm really
confused here.

45:35.530 --> 45:38.431
Well, maybe I could explain
things to you,

45:38.466 --> 45:40.633
in the other room,
by the machine.

45:42.804 --> 45:43.836
Yeah.

45:43.871 --> 45:45.337
Okay.

45:49.811 --> 45:50.811
Undercover?

45:51.813 --> 45:53.212
Undercover?

45:53.247 --> 45:54.658
And you've been down here
the whole time?

45:54.682 --> 45:55.648
Yeah.

45:55.683 --> 45:57.783
No wonder Parker's been
giving me the runaround.

45:57.819 --> 45:58.884
She's not.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.986
I've been running the marketing
department from here

46:01.022 --> 46:03.022
with Parker's help.

46:03.057 --> 46:04.457
What have you found out?

46:04.492 --> 46:06.025
Lots of things.

46:06.060 --> 46:07.793
For starters,
communication problems

46:07.829 --> 46:10.362
between the factory staff
and the main office.

46:10.398 --> 46:11.363
You met Flo.

46:11.399 --> 46:14.033
She's amazing at sales,

46:14.068 --> 46:15.735
yet every time she applies
for a job,

46:15.770 --> 46:17.870
no one at the main office
gets back to her.

46:17.905 --> 46:20.005
And Susan's been asking
for a new office chair

46:20.041 --> 46:21.841
but no one listens.

46:21.876 --> 46:23.409
That has to affect morale.

46:23.444 --> 46:25.044
Yeah, but that's not
our biggest issue.

46:25.079 --> 46:26.757
I think our sales problems
might be stemming

46:26.781 --> 46:28.514
from our automation strategy.

46:28.549 --> 46:29.849
I'm serious.

46:29.884 --> 46:30.850
Our Easter basket machine,

46:30.885 --> 46:32.985
it doesn't make the Easter
baskets as nicely.

46:33.020 --> 46:34.987
Well, it's a new prototype,
the first of its kind.

46:35.022 --> 46:37.323
Of course there's going to be
growing pains.

46:37.358 --> 46:38.991
What about our
cocoa bean sorter?

46:39.026 --> 46:41.026
Maybe if we had more real eyes
on the cocoa beans,

46:41.062 --> 46:43.596
less duds would get
into the product.

46:43.631 --> 46:46.532
Maybe our chocolate doesn't
taste as good anymore.

46:46.567 --> 46:47.833
Okay.

46:47.869 --> 46:50.436
You may have figured
a few things out,

46:50.471 --> 46:52.371
you gonna come back
to the office now?

46:52.406 --> 46:54.840
I feel like I have so much
work to do on my report.

46:54.876 --> 46:57.743
Like, this is just the tip
of the iceberg.

46:57.779 --> 47:00.546
Fine, but I wouldn't stay
much longer.

47:14.162 --> 47:16.462
What are you thinking about?

47:16.497 --> 47:18.397
Lyla, I really like it here.

47:18.432 --> 47:20.199
Well, Sweetwater does
that to people.

47:20.234 --> 47:23.469
And I'm learning so much
about the family business.

47:23.504 --> 47:25.304
But?

47:25.339 --> 47:29.375
I'm just sensing a but in there.

47:29.410 --> 47:34.980
But... It's this whole
double life thing.

47:35.016 --> 47:37.483
I'm gonna have to come clean
eventually, right?

47:37.518 --> 47:42.288
With everything, with everyone.

47:42.323 --> 47:43.389
With Bryan.

47:43.424 --> 47:46.425
That's up to you.

47:46.460 --> 47:48.928
You seem to like spending
time with him.

47:53.601 --> 47:56.335
So, say I tell him the truth,

47:56.370 --> 48:00.239
and he's so upset that he never
talks to me again.

48:00.274 --> 48:02.508
But more importantly, he's
already been through so much.

48:02.543 --> 48:04.443
I don't wanna hurt him.

48:04.478 --> 48:08.981
So, maybe I don't have to.

48:09.016 --> 48:10.249
How?

48:10.284 --> 48:14.486
I don't tell him the truth, and
I finish my commitments in town,

48:14.522 --> 48:17.122
and I leave Sweetwater.

48:20.661 --> 48:23.796
Sounds like you have a choice
to make.

48:39.882 --> 48:41.348
Bryan, this is amazing.

48:41.383 --> 48:43.049
Just a little something
I whipped up.

48:45.287 --> 48:46.119
What is it?

48:46.154 --> 48:47.787
It's Madison's favourite,
it's a...

48:47.823 --> 48:50.790
White chocolate buttercream.

48:50.826 --> 48:53.693
I'm sorry, I don't speak
mouthful-of-chocolate.

48:53.729 --> 48:54.895
I can translate for you.

48:54.930 --> 48:57.464
It is a white chocolate
buttercream.

48:57.499 --> 48:58.765
Fresh butter from a local farm,

48:58.800 --> 49:00.901
and I used vanilla pods
instead of extract.

49:00.936 --> 49:02.369
So good.

49:03.906 --> 49:05.538
You just made this up?

49:05.574 --> 49:07.774
I have a whole stack of
these recipes that I wanna try,

49:07.809 --> 49:11.478
but with my position with
the company right now,

49:11.513 --> 49:13.546
they're just kind
of collecting dust.

49:13.582 --> 49:15.448
But we get to taste test them.

49:15.484 --> 49:17.817
That's a pretty sweet
fringe benefit.

49:17.853 --> 49:19.719
All right, I'm gonna
leave you guys to it,

49:19.755 --> 49:20.887
got some work to do.

49:20.923 --> 49:22.422
Have fun.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.833
You're really good at sewing.

49:33.869 --> 49:35.268
Aw, thank you.

49:35.304 --> 49:36.736
I had a good teacher.

49:36.772 --> 49:38.271
Who was that?

49:38.307 --> 49:39.873
My mom.

49:46.114 --> 49:48.415
You know dads are really good
at teaching things too.

49:48.450 --> 49:51.818
Yeah. My dad's the best.

49:51.853 --> 49:53.453
I believe that.

49:53.488 --> 49:56.423
Tail me.

49:56.458 --> 49:59.025
All right.

49:59.061 --> 50:01.061
Let's put it there, then.

50:25.220 --> 50:26.519
Do you wanna try?

50:26.555 --> 50:27.555
Sure.

50:27.589 --> 50:29.022
Okay.

50:29.057 --> 50:30.090
Let me show you how.

50:30.125 --> 50:32.726
It's just like a bunny going in
and out of a hole.

50:32.761 --> 50:37.030
The bunny goes down
into the hole,

50:37.065 --> 50:40.467
and then up out of the hole.

50:40.502 --> 50:43.069
You try.

50:43.105 --> 50:46.873
The bunny goes down
through the hole,

50:46.908 --> 50:49.242
and the bunny comes back up.

50:49.277 --> 50:50.043
Very good.

50:50.078 --> 50:52.379
See, that's sewing.
You got it!

50:52.414 --> 50:54.514
Now you know how to sew.

50:54.549 --> 50:55.849
And we are all done.

50:57.219 --> 51:00.754
It's so good, thank you!

51:02.391 --> 51:04.758
You look so cute.

51:04.793 --> 51:07.394
You are gonna be the cutest
bunny there.

51:14.403 --> 51:16.102
What is that?

51:16.138 --> 51:18.338
Madison likes to call it
"Hippity Hop Fizz".

51:18.373 --> 51:21.274
It's a mix of orange juice,
cranberry, strawberry puree,

51:21.309 --> 51:23.343
the ice cubes are made
from pineapple juice,

51:23.378 --> 51:27.747
and the fizz...
it's a secret.

51:29.317 --> 51:31.718
Actually, it's club soda.

51:33.488 --> 51:36.056
To spring, and new beginnings.

51:39.428 --> 51:41.194
This is delicious.

51:41.229 --> 51:43.530
Madison has made it an Easter
morning tradition,

51:43.565 --> 51:46.399
especially when we do our
egg hunt around the house.

51:46.435 --> 51:49.069
So you're the Egg Marshal
at home too.

51:49.104 --> 51:50.303
That's very impressive.

51:57.179 --> 51:58.945
Did you do this drawing, Bryan?

51:58.980 --> 52:01.548
I just jot down ideas
from time to time.

52:01.583 --> 52:03.149
I wish I could do that.

52:03.185 --> 52:05.218
You're very talented.

52:05.253 --> 52:07.087
Wouldn't go that far.

52:07.122 --> 52:08.788
And too modest.

52:08.824 --> 52:12.459
Okay, I will take "talented"
but let's leave out the very, deal?

52:12.494 --> 52:13.960
Deal.

52:13.995 --> 52:15.428
All right.

52:21.603 --> 52:25.105
You know, it's late.

52:25.140 --> 52:26.172
I agree.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.974
I should probably go.

52:28.009 --> 52:29.509
Listen, thanks for everything

52:29.544 --> 52:31.678
that you've been doing
with Maddie.

52:31.713 --> 52:34.114
It was... it was
just sewing.

52:34.149 --> 52:35.782
No, it's so much more
than just sewing.

52:35.817 --> 52:38.451
She said that she considers you
a real friend.

52:44.326 --> 52:47.994
Bryan... I...

52:48.029 --> 52:49.662
What?

52:49.698 --> 52:52.098
Veronica, I made this for you.

52:53.869 --> 52:56.603
She's been working on it
since yesterday.

52:56.638 --> 52:58.471
I did it all by myself.

52:58.507 --> 52:59.339
To thank you.

52:59.374 --> 53:02.275
Daddy says people love
handmade things.

53:02.310 --> 53:03.176
Right Daddy?

53:03.211 --> 53:04.043
That's right.

53:04.079 --> 53:05.111
Well, your daddy's right.

53:05.147 --> 53:07.280
Handmade gifts are the best.

53:07.315 --> 53:08.548
Thank you. I love it.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.550
You're welcome.

53:10.585 --> 53:13.119
And you can decorate it
any way you want.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.325
Veronica?

53:19.361 --> 53:21.561
Is everything okay?

53:21.596 --> 53:23.329
Never better.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.132
Are you leaving?

53:26.168 --> 53:27.367
Yes.

53:27.402 --> 53:29.547
Thank you for the juice, thank
you for this beautiful egg.

53:29.571 --> 53:31.204
Can I borrow these drawings?

53:31.239 --> 53:33.050
Is that okay?
I promise I'll bring it back.

53:33.074 --> 53:34.040
Sure. I'm not worried about it.

53:34.075 --> 53:35.842
Thank you. Bye!

53:39.915 --> 53:42.382
I think she likes my egg.

54:00.235 --> 54:01.901
<i>The legendary Cavendish Egg.</i>

54:01.937 --> 54:05.338
We bring back the greatest
Easter chocolate that ever was.

54:05.373 --> 54:06.606
I don't know, Veronica.

54:06.641 --> 54:09.542
We're gonna make it bigger and
more beautiful than ever before.

54:09.578 --> 54:12.111
And you can pitch it
to management.

54:12.147 --> 54:12.879
Me?

54:12.914 --> 54:14.113
Yes, you.

54:14.149 --> 54:17.750
Unless there's another Bryan
Bailey that I don't know about.

54:17.786 --> 54:20.186
I know that with your creativity
and chocolate expertise,

54:20.222 --> 54:21.621
it will be a huge hit.

54:21.656 --> 54:23.122
It's only three weeks
until Easter.

54:23.158 --> 54:25.124
So?

54:25.160 --> 54:27.627
We are having a hard-enough time
making our quota as it is,

54:27.662 --> 54:29.362
let alone making
a new chocolate.

54:29.397 --> 54:30.330
Bryan, it is...

54:30.365 --> 54:32.932
Besides, management
would never go for it.

54:32.968 --> 54:34.701
They never listen to my ideas.

54:34.736 --> 54:36.069
You sure about that?

54:36.104 --> 54:38.204
Yes, I am sure.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.207
Well, then, we'll just have
to figure it out together.

54:45.981 --> 54:48.114
See? I knew you
would come around.

54:56.492 --> 54:58.191
Do you really think
they'll go for it?

54:58.227 --> 54:59.192
Think about it.

54:59.228 --> 55:01.695
All these new chocolate
companies like Chocmate

55:01.730 --> 55:04.264
are popping up with their
modern, trendy takes.

55:04.300 --> 55:08.569
Like green tea chocolate,
cucumber, peanut and ketchup.

55:08.604 --> 55:09.970
Really?

55:10.005 --> 55:11.405
Okay, well, I made
that last one up.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.273
But, we go the other direction.

55:13.309 --> 55:17.644
Back to tradition, back to
what made Cavendish great.

55:17.680 --> 55:18.912
We still do our current line,

55:18.948 --> 55:21.982
but with a little
retro wow factor.

55:22.017 --> 55:24.151
The legendary Cavendish Egg.

55:24.186 --> 55:25.218
Can I be honest with you?

55:25.254 --> 55:26.320
Always.

55:26.355 --> 55:28.121
Before you even mentioned this,

55:28.157 --> 55:30.424
I've been thinking
about this for weeks.

55:30.459 --> 55:31.459
Great minds.

55:31.493 --> 55:32.859
Yeah.

55:34.964 --> 55:35.964
And hear me out.

55:35.998 --> 55:37.064
Okay.

55:37.099 --> 55:40.167
Instead of putting a toy inside,
we put a butterfly.

55:40.202 --> 55:41.101
Butterfly.

55:41.136 --> 55:43.770
A white chocolate
buttercream butterfly,

55:43.806 --> 55:46.073
from your own personal recipe.

55:46.108 --> 55:48.609
We paint the wings
pink and purple,

55:48.644 --> 55:50.444
the colours of Easter.

55:50.479 --> 55:51.445
Sounds beautiful.

55:51.480 --> 55:54.314
Because the butterfly
is the symbol of spring.

55:54.350 --> 55:55.182
Renewal.

55:55.217 --> 55:56.350
Change.

55:56.385 --> 55:57.351
Which is exactly what we want
to do with this company.

55:57.386 --> 56:00.687
We could have a whole collection
of surprises.

56:00.723 --> 56:03.090
Because it's what's on
the inside that counts.

56:08.197 --> 56:10.998
So, where do we start?

56:11.033 --> 56:14.368
How about at the beginning?

56:14.403 --> 56:16.937
That makes a lot of sense.

56:19.508 --> 56:21.808
This is a beautiful drawing,
Bryan.

56:21.844 --> 56:24.211
But Easter's less
than three weeks away,

56:24.246 --> 56:25.724
and I'm just the factory
manager here,

56:25.748 --> 56:27.681
I can't green light
a new chocolate.

56:28.951 --> 56:31.318
So you're saying we're going
to have to go through Carter.

56:31.353 --> 56:34.321
Probably, yes.

56:34.356 --> 56:35.722
Unless we go through
someone else,

56:35.758 --> 56:37.891
like the director of marketing.

56:37.926 --> 56:38.792
Really?

56:38.827 --> 56:39.660
Yes.

56:39.695 --> 56:40.661
That's an idea.

56:40.696 --> 56:43.363
Marketing and operations
often work hand in hand.

56:43.399 --> 56:44.164
That's right.

56:44.199 --> 56:45.365
That's interesting.

56:45.401 --> 56:47.968
Currently, Erin Cavendish
is the director of marketing.

56:48.003 --> 56:50.404
I heard she's very good,
and really smart.

56:50.439 --> 56:51.439
I heard that too.

56:52.541 --> 56:55.542
Actually, I have her cell number
in my company index here.

56:55.577 --> 56:56.910
I could give her a call
right now.

56:56.945 --> 56:58.145
Now?

56:58.180 --> 56:59.646
Yeah.

57:01.450 --> 57:03.750
No, no, no, no.

57:03.786 --> 57:04.551
No sense waiting.

57:04.586 --> 57:06.953
I agree. Let's not waste
any time.

57:13.696 --> 57:15.996
It's ringing.

57:19.201 --> 57:20.434
Well, she's not answering.

57:20.469 --> 57:23.170
Probably in a meeting
or something.

57:23.205 --> 57:24.137
Voicemail.

57:24.173 --> 57:26.873
Hello, Miss Cavendish,
this is Susan Enwright.

57:26.909 --> 57:29.176
<i>Factory manager here
at the Sweetwater plant.</i>

57:29.211 --> 57:32.679
<i>I have two very talented
employees who have a great idea.</i>

57:37.553 --> 57:39.686
I didn't know Erin
was going undercover?

57:39.722 --> 57:40.932
Sir, I feel like
at the very least

57:40.956 --> 57:42.889
I should've been
told about this.

57:42.925 --> 57:45.258
I wanted to keep it
between Erin and me.

57:45.294 --> 57:46.927
What can she tell you
that I can't?

57:46.962 --> 57:48.606
I did a recent tour of
the Sweetwater plant

57:48.630 --> 57:51.264
and phase one is
going very well.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.100
Erin has a different opinion.

57:53.135 --> 57:56.536
Sir, I've been at this company
for six years.

57:56.572 --> 57:58.972
I care about what we've
built and what we will build.

57:59.007 --> 58:01.119
I want this company to grow,
and I want to grow with it.

58:01.143 --> 58:03.376
Phase two, 50 percent
automation.

58:03.412 --> 58:05.056
I've got a team ready
to go in this weekend,

58:05.080 --> 58:06.246
I just need the green light.

58:06.281 --> 58:09.983
I'll make a decision after
Erin finishes her assignment.

58:10.018 --> 58:12.252
I'd like to hear her
full report.

58:12.287 --> 58:13.954
Fair enough.

58:13.989 --> 58:15.789
You know my position.

58:24.533 --> 58:25.966
What do you think, Pop?

58:26.001 --> 58:27.901
Are we ready for this?

58:35.978 --> 58:36.877
Good news.

58:36.912 --> 58:39.579
I just got an email
from Erin Cavendish.

58:39.615 --> 58:41.815
You have a presentation 10:00 AM
Wednesday morning

58:41.850 --> 58:44.651
at Cavendish Headquarters
in Seattle.

58:44.686 --> 58:46.453
What?

58:46.488 --> 58:47.354
That's incredible.

58:47.389 --> 58:48.622
That's amazing.

58:48.657 --> 58:49.689
Congrats, you deserve it.

58:49.725 --> 58:50.624
Me, what about you?

58:50.659 --> 58:53.493
You'll be presenting
to the entire board.

58:53.529 --> 58:55.262
Wow, Susan.

58:55.297 --> 58:56.129
Thank you.

58:56.165 --> 58:57.931
Don't thank me,
thank Erin Cavendish.

58:57.966 --> 59:00.500
Wherever she is.

59:00.536 --> 59:01.468
Okay, so Wednesday.

59:01.503 --> 59:02.614
That doesn't give us
that much time, but...

59:02.638 --> 59:05.872
We can do it.

59:05.908 --> 59:08.942
Well, sounds like you
have an egg to make.

59:08.977 --> 59:10.677
Better get cracking.

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:06.266
Nice work, Miss Erinson.

01:00:06.301 --> 01:00:08.301
Excellent work, Mr. Bailey.

01:00:12.474 --> 01:00:14.107
- Thank you, Murray.
- Thank you, Murray.

01:00:14.142 --> 01:00:15.375
You're welcome.

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.211
I'm going to bed.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.579
It looks beautiful, you two.

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:20.615
Break a leg.

01:00:20.649 --> 01:00:21.681
Thanks.

01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:23.149
Good night.

01:00:24.786 --> 01:00:26.519
I think the presentation's
gonna go great.

01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:29.756
Let me know if you need help
with any of the prep.

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:30.624
Help with the prep?

01:00:30.659 --> 01:00:32.359
You're doing it with me.

01:00:33.495 --> 01:00:34.694
Bryan, you're the creative.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.862
You should do the pitch.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.764
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:40.033
I can't go in front
of the entire board.

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:41.635
Yes, you can.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.769
We're a team.

01:00:42.804 --> 01:00:46.973
We did this together,
we're going in there together.

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:48.742
No debate.

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.619
I hope everyone got
the undercover memo.

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:02.623
Veronica Erinson from Sweetwater
is our Erin Cavendish.

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:05.626
And Bryan doesn't know
that Veronica is Erin?

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.627
Correct.

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.494
Got it.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.797
I'm gonna need another cup
of coffee.

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:21.709
I wonder if Erin Cavendish
will be in there.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:24.144
I... I don't know how
to answer that.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.981
I know she's really busy,
but I wanna thank her.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.083
I've never met her,

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:34.621
but I somehow feel that
she's responsible for this.

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:35.689
Bryan...

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:40.394
This is probably the worst
timing ever, but...

01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:42.863
I'm not who you think I am.

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:44.176
Veronica, what are you
talking about?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.744
If this is about presenting
to the room,

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.067
I can do most of the talking.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.135
That's not what I mean...

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.770
We're ready for you now.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.706
Okay.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:56.944
After you.

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:02.683
Bryan is gonna start us off.

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:04.596
Walk us through the creative
side of this chocolate

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:08.222
as well as some of the
inspiration behind it.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.691
Bryan?

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:13.994
Thank you, Veronica.

01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:17.164
Creatively, the legendary
Cavendish Egg is a return

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:19.700
to the kind of artisan
and handcrafted chocolates

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:22.102
that we are famous for.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.203
The milk chocolate base

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.507
is covered in vibrant Easter
colours and jellybeans.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.942
But we have added
a modern flourish.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:33.113
These icing sugar flowers really
highlight the seasonal spirit.

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.382
Nice intro Bryan,
but I have a question.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.250
Yes?

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:37.285
Can we eat it?

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:40.254
We thought you'd never ask.

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:41.588
Yeah, let's crack it open.

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.376
This is one of the most
delicious chocolates

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.433
I've ever had.

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.001
Please try a bite.

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:05.157
And this is a white chocolate
buttercream butterfly.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:13.787
And it goes inside...
instead of a toy.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.655
I can eat this?

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.923
You bet you can.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.135
And there's an opportunity
to put other

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:20.727
chocolate animal surprises
inside if we get the go-ahead.

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:21.763
If?

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.464
I thought we talked about when.

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:27.234
Ha, Bryan, you remind me of one
of my favourite sayings.

01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:31.271
Confidence is the stepping stone
to achievement.

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:32.307
And Er...

01:03:37.012 --> 01:03:40.647
And err on the side of caution
is also what you're saying?

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.983
Be bold but stay
within yourself.

01:03:43.018 --> 01:03:46.119
Yes, yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying, thank you.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:49.156
Veronica.

01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:50.268
I'll be honest. I
like this product,

01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:52.693
but a return to artisan
chocolate runs counter to...

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.461
Not all chocolates
will be made this way,

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.030
just certain special ones.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.199
To celebrate the history.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.135
The Cavendish history,
which we have a lot of.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.906
And to be honest,

01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:08.642
we like your move to update
the Sweetwater factory.

01:04:08.677 --> 01:04:09.877
You do?

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.823
The production efficiency of
the new machines will permit us

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:14.982
to repurpose the employees
lost on the assembly line.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.183
Free them up.

01:04:16.218 --> 01:04:18.318
To make more handcrafted
chocolates?

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.397
And get the best of both worlds.

01:04:19.421 --> 01:04:21.788
We can have our buttery
bunnies and eat them too.

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:25.993
But we are confident that people
are going to love this product.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.562
Which will renew interest in
the entire Cavendish lineup

01:04:28.597 --> 01:04:29.863
like never before.

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:31.532
Is marketing here?

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.634
Yes?

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:36.336
Parker, can we run the analytics
on rebooting classic content?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.372
Absolutely.

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.873
Well, thank you very much,
Veronica and Bryan.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:40.919
Since we're tight on time,

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.876
you'll be hearing from us
by tomorrow morning.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:46.013
- Either way.
- Thank you, Veronica, Bryan.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.648
Thank you.

01:04:50.719 --> 01:04:53.654
Hey, we did it.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:55.889
Yeah, I don't even care
if this gets green lit,

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.859
I'm just... I'm so happy
right now.

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.561
I'm glad, Bryan.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.029
Really, I am.

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:22.282
Hello?

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.083
Hi, Bryan.

01:05:23.118 --> 01:05:24.952
It's Chaz and Trent
from Chocmate.

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.631
Hope you don't mind us
calling you at home.

01:05:26.655 --> 01:05:28.055
Not at all.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.723
How are the spring
chocolates coming?

01:05:29.758 --> 01:05:30.724
It depends.

01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:32.137
Are we speaking to our
new head chocolatier?

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.963
Look, I really appreciate
the offer,

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.398
but I don't think that
right now is the best time

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.566
to make a change.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.546
Well, you could always leave
'em after the spring rush.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.381
We'd love to run some ideas
by you for our summer line.

01:05:43.405 --> 01:05:44.371
Tell him about Ocean Wave.

01:05:44.406 --> 01:05:45.606
Ocean Wave, Bryan.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.541
<i>A salted seaweed chocolate
with salt</i>

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.054
<i>harvested straight
from the Pacific.</i>

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:50.043
And we'll churn 'em out

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.279
faster than you can say
walla-walla-Washington.

01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:57.884
<i>We were very impressed,
I'll be honest.</i>

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.886
Well then, we'll have
to make it.

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:02.756
Well, you know I'd like to,
but time is tight,

01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:04.891
and we've gotta have Carter
on board.

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.293
<i>You know how it works, Erin.</i>

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:07.761
<i>We do things right.</i>

01:06:07.796 --> 01:06:09.429
I know, I know.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:11.765
You and Bryan make quite a team.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.267
<i>You mean Veronica and Bryan.</i>

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:17.971
Dad, I've decided that I'm gonna
tell Bryan who I really am.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.406
Tomorrow.

01:06:19.441 --> 01:06:23.176
<i>This has been going on too long,
and I can't lie to him anymore.</i>

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:26.313
I realize that it might
not go over well.

01:06:26.348 --> 01:06:28.448
Sounds like you're doing
the right thing.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.184
I'm proud of you.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.254
Thanks, Dad. Bye.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:43.030
Morning. I have a new
office chair.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:46.166
Really? You're kidding!

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:51.605
Susan Enwright.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.240
Hi Carter.

01:06:54.743 --> 01:06:55.876
There you are.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.310
Susan.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.111
Have you seen Bryan?

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.880
I have some great news.

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.149
They decided to do
the Cavendish Egg.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.885
Really? That's amazing!

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.488
It's less than three weeks
till Easter,

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.723
but I know we can do it.

01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:11.525
Carter told me how we'll
make it work.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.859
We begin this afternoon.

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.961
Thank you.

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.230
Have you told Bryan yet?

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.576
No, but he should be
here shortly.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.833
We have a quick meeting.

01:07:19.868 --> 01:07:23.737
If you don't mind, I... I would
really love to tell him myself.

01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:25.138
Of course!

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.473
Mum's the word.

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:27.841
And did I tell you?

01:07:27.876 --> 01:07:31.511
I got a new chair,
just out of the blue!

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.547
Everything's coming up spring.

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.615
What a great surprise.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.388
I think that we should be good
for the buttery bunnies, but...

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:46.693
We might be a little late
on the marshmallow lilies.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.095
What is it?

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.063
Do you notice anything?

01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:56.403
You got a new chair.

01:07:56.438 --> 01:08:01.074
Look at this, it's got wooden
arms, a cushy seat.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:01.942
Hey.

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.410
Wanna take it for a spin?

01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:04.445
Sure.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.683
Oh dear.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.286
Looks like it's all right.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.155
This one is...

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.042
Bryan!

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.912
Bryan!

01:08:38.947 --> 01:08:41.548
I just spoke with Susan,
they green lit our egg.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:43.716
They're making our egg!

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:51.057
I thought you would be
more excited.

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:54.627
I wish I could be, Erin.

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:57.964
That is your name, right?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.099
Bryan, I...

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.233
Yeah.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:03.636
I saw a photo of you and
your dad in Susan's office,

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:05.572
and pictures don't lie, do they?

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:08.774
Just tell me the truth,
I wanna hear it from you.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.279
Yes. I'm Erin Cavendish.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.015
Okay, so this is just some kind
of practical joke?

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.349
No!

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.417
I... I wanted to tell
you sooner.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:19.953
Why did you do all of this?

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.822
To see how things work
from the inside.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.124
This was just a business idea.

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:26.459
I never expected
for things to get so...

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.295
Personal?

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.363
Yes, if I'd come in here
with you knowing

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.231
who I was from the start,

01:09:31.265 --> 01:09:33.200
you never would've been
honest with me.

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:34.533
But you wanna talk
about honesty?

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.569
Okay.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.981
What was that whole charade
in the boardroom?

01:09:37.005 --> 01:09:38.205
Everyone was in on it?

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.518
You know you guys sure have
a funny way of doing business.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:41.474
Okay, look.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.442
We... we took things too far.

01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:45.946
I feel like a fool.

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.247
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:09:50.385 --> 01:09:53.854
It's too late for that, Erin.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:57.624
You know now, now they're
rolling out the legendary egg.

01:09:57.659 --> 01:09:59.204
And it's not because
of the presentation,

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.794
it's because you're a Cavendish.

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:02.062
It had nothing to do with me.

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:04.364
It had everything to do
with you.

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:05.966
You shined in there.

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.168
Everyone could see it.

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:11.171
The design was all yours.

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:13.673
You know, I got a job offer

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.176
from Chaz and Trent
over at Chocmate.

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:17.077
Head chocolatier.

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:19.045
I'm not a big fan
of their chocolate,

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.981
I'm actually thinking about
taking it.

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:23.250
The only thing that was
keeping me from saying yes

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:26.186
was this company,
this family, your family

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:28.321
and everything
that they've built.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.289
Yeah, I actually started
to think

01:10:29.324 --> 01:10:31.157
that things were turning around
for me here.

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:32.092
You made me believe that,

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:36.897
you made me believe in myself,
and now...

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:38.598
I don't know what to believe,

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:42.669
so maybe I should
just take that job.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.417
Daddy.

01:10:56.452 --> 01:11:00.120
Are we ever gonna see
Veronica again?

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:01.722
I'm not sure honey.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:02.723
It's a...

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:05.426
Well, it's a long story.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.528
But her real name is Erin.

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.963
I don't understand.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:12.800
Well, to tell you the truth,
neither do I.

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:16.370
But she's still the same person,
right?

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.072
What do you mean?

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:21.475
Well, I'm playing the Easter
Bunny in the pageant,

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.143
but it's just a costume.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:26.080
I'm still me.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.468
Erin, we need you.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.770
Our social media platforms
need you.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:53.340
Well, I am not feeling
all that social these days.

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:54.308
We need a great campaign

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.011
to go along with our
Cavendish Egg release.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.413
I am all out of ideas.

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:00.681
That's not you.

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.416
You tell us at marketing
all the time,

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.849
there's always a story,

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.914
and you just need
to be inspired by it.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:12.626
What inspired you in Sweetwater?

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.585
I'm standing outside the
Cavendish Chocolate Company's

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.919
flagship store in Seattle,

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.355
where customers are lined
out the door.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:49.256
Why?

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.191
It seems everything
old is new again,

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:55.462
with the relaunch of the hugely
popular legendary Cavendish Egg.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:58.232
The demand for this Easter
treat is extremely high,

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.901
<i>not just in Seattle,
but across the country.</i>

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.203
<i>Thanks to an effective
marketing campaign.</i>

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:07.141
And...
great chocolate.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.776
Back to you, Colin.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.381
It's a smashing success.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:18.139
Your granddad would be so proud,
and your mom too.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.990
I'm glad that people really
connected with the campaign.

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.992
It always starts with people.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.627
And a great product.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:29.163
I have you to thank for that.

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:31.965
And Bryan.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.002
Yes, and Bryan.

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:38.772
Why don't you talk to him?

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:41.275
I don't think he ever wants
to talk to me again.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:45.245
I think he might come around.

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:46.458
Dad, I have a question
to ask you,

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.749
and I want you to be honest
with me.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.017
Of course.

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:55.122
What was the real reason that
you sent me down to Sweetwater?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:59.493
What did you see?

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:02.196
All sorts of things.

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.598
How we make chocolate.

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.667
The people who make it.

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:09.837
And what did you see
in yourself?

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.678
I saw sides of myself,

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.781
sides that I didn't even know
were there.

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.127
Or maybe they were there
all along,

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:26.220
and they just needed time
to grow.

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:30.891
I think that answers
your question.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.794
You may have answered mine, too.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.031
The return of the legendary
Cavendish Egg

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.501
is a legendary success.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:41.702
So thank you everyone.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:46.540
But.

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:49.543
Easter is a time for surprises.

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:52.412
As you know, we have a high-level
position in our company

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:57.150
that is currently vacant, and I
think I found a replacement.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:01.588
I'm proud to announce
as our new Senior VP,

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:02.856
Erin Cavendish.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:14.268
Thank you everyone.
I'm so flattered and honoured.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:19.406
I... I wasn't expecting this,
to be honest.

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.875
After these past few weeks,

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:25.045
I know that this company is not
just where I'm meant to be,

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.880
but where I want to be.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:30.951
I'm proud to be a Cavendish.

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.719
Ninety years ago,
my grandfather came

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.054
to Sweetwater, Washington

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.590
with nothing but a suitcase
and a dream.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.792
And that dream is still
with us today.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:41.595
And I'm excited to see where
we can take it from here.

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:45.032
So, if I may.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:50.404
I would like to add, our success
is a reflection of everyone here

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.905
at team Cavendish.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.875
So, I would like
to thank Carter,

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.877
for seeing what I was seeing,

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:59.246
and for being instrumental

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.583
in bringing this project
to the finish line.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.818
But more importantly,
and he's not here,

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:07.087
but I would like to thank Bryan.

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.455
Bryan Bailey.

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:12.626
Without his creativity
and confidence...

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:18.866
Anyway.

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:23.737
Thank you to Bryan,
our talented chocolatier.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:26.239
And there were...
there were others,

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.675
names you may know,
and many you don't,

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:30.477
who helped me along the way.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:33.747
So I'd like to recommend
a few changes.

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.418
Hey, I heard.

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:40.420
Lead decorator on
handmade chocolates?

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.155
Congrats.

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:44.157
Thanks.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:18.959
Yes!

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.543
Hey, Flo.

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.111
Hey, Veronica.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:39.179
Erin.

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.214
Miss Cavendish.

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:43.617
Erin is fine.

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.919
Congratulations on
your new position.

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.688
Thank you.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.624
But I'm afraid I have some news.

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.359
We'd like to transfer you.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.927
Transfer?

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.562
Somewhere else in the factory?

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:56.763
Or Iowa?

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.231
Seattle.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.045
I'd like to promote you
to Associate Sales Manager

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.535
at our main office.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.437
What?!

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:07.941
Thank you so much.

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:09.910
You deserve it, Flo.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.752
<i>...I still think
I stand a chance.</i>

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.424
Take care.

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:27.294
Hey, Bryan.

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:31.095
Happy Easter.

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.731
Happy Easter.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:37.237
This is really something.

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.673
I'm glad that I could get down
to see it.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.509
Yeah.

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.244
Congratulations on
the company's success,

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.946
and being named Senior VP.

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.013
I heard.

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:48.148
Yes. Thank you.

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:51.184
But, the egg's a hit
because of you.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.019
I... I wanted to...

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:55.989
You don't have to thank me.

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:58.325
What I'm trying to say is,

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.027
it's wonderful that people love
what we created,

01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:04.136
and I want to be able
to celebrate that success,

01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:11.155
but it was wrong of me to
pretend to be someone else.

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.672
But these past few weeks,

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.008
I learned more about myself
by being Veronica

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:19.212
than I ever knew about myself
as Erin, if...

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.615
if that even makes sense.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:25.318
And while I learned so much
of that from being here

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:29.122
in Sweetwater,

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:32.058
I learned most of that from you.

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:34.327
By seeing how you are
with Madison,

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:39.699
and your passion and creativity
about chocolate, but...

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:43.637
Most of all, from how you are
with me.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:53.313
You bring out the best in me,
and we make a good team,

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:56.583
in so many ways.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.685
Can I be honest?

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:02.589
Always.

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:06.726
You're not the only one
who's been pretending.

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:09.796
You bring out the best in me,
and...

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:19.039
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.851
I'm falling in love
with you too.

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.090
But I should warn you.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.725
One of my first decisions as SVP

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.527
is to launch an entirely
new line of

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.129
hand-crafted Cavendish
holiday classics

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:44.931
for all the upcoming seasons.

01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:48.702
The teaser is, if you thought
Easter was legendary...

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.048
Just wait until you see
Halloween?

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.104
Exactly!

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.739
But not so fast.

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:54.641
You're gonna need some training.

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.475
Training?

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:56.510
Yes.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:59.713
My director of production
and head chocolatier

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:02.382
will want to expand
his horizons.

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.429
I'm sending you to Switzerland
for three weeks in the summer

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:07.988
to study chocolate making
with Gabriel Belanger.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:08.955
Are you serious?

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:10.056
Yes!

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.992
Bryan Bailey!

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:12.859
Mr. Cavendish.

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:14.961
Congratulations on your
new position.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:16.229
Long time coming.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.097
Thank you, sir.

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:17.898
I did it! I did it.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:21.067
I found something
really special.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.770
I think I did too, sweetie.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:26.907
Erin! I'm so glad you came back
for all the fun.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:30.076
Well, I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.779
I'm sorry that I wasn't honest
about myself.

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:35.315
That's okay.
It's only a name.

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:38.318
I know who you really are.

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.853
And I was thinking
about Switzerland,

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.955
that maybe I would come
with you.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.456
I hear it's lovely
in the summer.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:45.258
Are we going to Switzerland?

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.860
You bet we are, sweetheart!

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.797
Daddy told me they make
the best chocolate there.

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.866
Well, maybe the second best.

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.935
<i>It's time for the Easter
Pageant.</i>

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:55.970
The pageant.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.438
Come on!
