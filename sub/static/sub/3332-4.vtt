00:00.001 --> 00:03.168
Latin lover narrator: Hola.
<i>It's me again. Let's review.</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:05.204
<i>By now you all know the deal--</i>
<i>jane was accidentally</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:07.473
<i>Artificially inseminated.</i>
<i>But I've never had sex!</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:10.442
<i>You know who</i> wasn't <i>thrilled</i>
<i>with this development--</i>

00:10.444 --> 00:11.710
<i>Jane's detective boyfriend</i>
<i>michael.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:13.746
For us...

00:13.748 --> 00:15.247
Don't have this baby.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.715
<i>But jane decided to have it.</i>

00:16.717 --> 00:18.550
And we're giving it to
the father, he and his wife,

00:18.552 --> 00:19.718
And they're
a really great couple.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.786
<i>They weren't.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:23.088
<i>In fact, rafael had started</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:24.223
<i>To suspect his wife</i>
<i>might be hiding something.</i>

00:24.225 --> 00:25.657
You know the cops think

00:25.659 --> 00:27.326
That he was seeing someone?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.427
Zaz?
Yeah.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.295
I guess we'll find out
who it was.

00:30.297 --> 00:33.432
<i>She was. An affair with the</i>
<i>recently deceased roman zazo,</i>

00:33.434 --> 00:35.467
<i>Which jane's fiancÃ©</i>
<i>michael knew about.</i>

00:35.469 --> 00:37.302
End the affair, or I'll
tell your husband.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.805
And, trust me, jane's not
giving that baby to him alone.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.440
And you don't want it.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.342
<i>And so he helped her</i>
<i>cover up the fact</i>

00:43.344 --> 00:45.310
<i>That she was there</i>
<i>the night of the murder.</i>

00:45.312 --> 00:46.645
<i>If it sounds straight out</i>
<i>of a telenovela, it is.</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:48.647
<i>And speaking of telenovelas,</i>

00:48.649 --> 00:51.150
<i>Jane's mother was currently</i>
<i>hooking up with her father,</i>

00:51.152 --> 00:53.552
<i>Famous telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio da la vega.</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:56.388
Some kind of gift,

00:56.390 --> 00:57.589
<i>From rogelio, it looks like.</i>

00:57.591 --> 01:00.225
"always and forever, xo."

01:00.227 --> 01:01.760
<i>Though jane doesn't know</i>
<i>he's her father... Yet.</i>

01:01.762 --> 01:04.296
<i>And now we can start.</i>

01:04.298 --> 01:07.232
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva's</i>
<i>first wedding</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:09.535
<i>Went off without a hitch.</i>

01:09.537 --> 01:13.272
In fact, walking down the aisle
<i>in her</i> abeula's <i>dress,</i>

01:13.274 --> 01:16.308
<i>Jane didn't feel nervous,</i>
<i>not for a moment.</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:19.778
<i>Because she was marrying</i>
<i>her very best friend.</i>

01:19.780 --> 01:22.581
I promise to love you
forever and ever.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.383
I promise to love <i>you</i>

01:24.385 --> 01:25.851
Forever and ever.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.089
<i>Alas...</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:31.723
<i>Present-day wedding planning</i>

01:31.725 --> 01:34.393
<i>Was slightly more...</i>
<i>Complicated.</i>

01:34.395 --> 01:37.429
<i>For one thing, the wedding</i>
<i>was only a week away.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:39.565
<i>For another, way bigger thing,</i>

01:39.567 --> 01:42.301
<i>Jane was pregnant</i>
<i>with another man's baby--</i>

01:42.303 --> 01:44.736
<i>A man she'd been</i>
<i>having feelings for.</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:47.806
Xiomara:
"listen to your heart."
what?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.341
The power ballad by roxette.
That's what I want

01:49.343 --> 01:51.310
To sing at the reception.
Are you gonna have a band?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.312
I don't know.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.315
What do you guys think
about getting a food truck?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.383
I made an appointment
for the bridal shop.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.254
Pre-cana-- that's the, uh,
wedding counseling thing?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.622
Yeah, and you need
to order a cake.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.391
Rafael:
I love <i>tres leches.</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:08.560
Okay, that's enough!

02:09.362 --> 02:10.896
Are you okay, honey?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.664
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The way I see it,</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:14.533
<i>Jane has two choices here:</i>

02:20.507 --> 02:23.275
Yeah, it's just all
this crazy wedding planning.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.476
Maybe it's just...

02:24.478 --> 02:27.379
Too much to pull together
in one week.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.681
Give us a minute?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.517
Mm-hmm.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.853
(sighs)

02:34.855 --> 02:37.356
Babe, I know this
is overwhelming.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.757
You've got a lot on
your plate right now,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.526
But I'm here, too, okay?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.461
We merged our calendars.
Your phone beeps,

02:42.463 --> 02:43.529
My phone beeps.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.230
And I love you.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.865
I love you, too.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.401
So that's all that
matters, right?
Everything else--

02:49.403 --> 02:53.438
This super-religious
carnival with power ballads--

02:53.440 --> 02:54.940
(laughing)
who cares!

02:54.942 --> 02:57.442
At the end of the day,
it's just you and me.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.744
And a food truck.
Uh...

02:58.746 --> 03:01.213
I could live without
the food truck.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.515
But I cannot live
without you.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.318
<i>And in that moment,</i>
<i>jane vowed to focus</i>

03:06.320 --> 03:09.454
<i>On the man she knew she loved.</i>

03:09.456 --> 03:12.224
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

03:12.226 --> 03:15.260
<i>You never really see</i>
<i>a broken heart coming.</i>

03:18.598 --> 03:21.233
Our first sleepover here.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.467
Ooh...

03:22.469 --> 03:24.703
Door's open,
but I'll still take it.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.339
Open, closed--
doesn't matter.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.474
Not doing anything-- not with
your grandma down the hall.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.877
No way.
(laughs): Michael,
she's asleep.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.379
(whispers): That's what
she wants us to think.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.547
(laughs)

03:35.549 --> 03:38.717
Are you sure
I can't convince you

03:38.719 --> 03:40.552
To do <i>anything?</i>

03:40.554 --> 03:41.887
Okay. Okay.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.957
Ah, I just want
you so badly.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.960
(moans softly)

03:47.962 --> 03:49.494
(exhales)

03:49.496 --> 03:50.662
(gasps)

03:50.664 --> 03:52.864
Are you okay?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.833
Yeah...
(nervous chuckle)

03:54.835 --> 03:56.902
Okay.

03:59.472 --> 04:02.374
Well, when you hear something,
will you please let me know?

04:03.343 --> 04:04.610
Thank you, officer.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.448
Was that about zaz's case?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.249
Yeah.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.583
Any suspects?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.485
(sighs): No.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.991
Well, do they have any leads
on who he was seeing?

04:18.993 --> 04:20.993
I mean, maybe that person
knows something.

04:22.662 --> 04:26.265
They're confident they'll
find out who it was.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.436
I'm gonna take a shower.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.845
Mm, mm...
I'll see you at noon

04:39.847 --> 04:41.446
For the pre-cana.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.991
Yay!

04:52.993 --> 04:54.626
Okay.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.867
What's going on, baby?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.403
What do you mean?
"yay"?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.038
Mom...

05:06.040 --> 05:08.040
I had a dream.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.375
Like a martin luther
king kind of thing?
No.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.644
Like a sex dream
kind of thing.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.447
Okay, honey, that's
perfectly normal.

05:15.449 --> 05:19.518
Mom... It wasn't
michael in it with me.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.054
It was rafael.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.822
Oh...

05:23.824 --> 05:25.624
Was it just a sex dream,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.426
Or are you having
feelings for him?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.061
I don't know.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.629
Maybe feelings.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.731
(gasps) do you think
they're real feelings,

05:32.733 --> 05:35.467
Or "I'm having his baby
and it's getting all
muddled in my brain

05:35.469 --> 05:37.803
But it doesn't really
mean anything" feelings?
That. Those.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.937
Definitely those.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.572
I mean, I love michael.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.841
And you still want
to marry him?
Yes.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.010
Definitely yes.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.645
I just...
What?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.080
I don't know,
it's been so different

05:48.082 --> 05:49.481
Between us since
the insemination.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.450
Well, you guys got
to work through this,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.518
Because it's gonna be
a long pregnancy.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.487
But don't tell him
about the dream.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.788
That's just fantasy stuff.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.657
There's no need
to get him upset.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.392
I'm upset.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.827
What if this happens again?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.762
Okay, listen...

06:03.764 --> 06:05.530
When I started
having dreams

06:05.532 --> 06:07.399
About the convenience
store guy,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.434
I started getting my
slurpees somewhere else.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.403
Hm!
You got to
avoid rafael.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.938
But if you can't,
if you have to be

06:12.940 --> 06:15.607
In the same room as him,
keep a safe physical distance,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.509
Like, three feet.
Actually,

06:17.511 --> 06:19.511
With that guy,
better make it four.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.579
I'll try anything.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.814
I just ate.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.784
Thanks, mom.
I love you, abuela.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.019
Love you, too.
(speaks spanish)

06:28.021 --> 06:30.822
Bye, baby.
(speaks spanish)

06:39.632 --> 06:40.999
Ma, get off my back.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.040
You know what?

06:49.042 --> 06:50.642
You're right.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.177
I should go see him.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.615
Ma, ro and I need

06:56.617 --> 06:58.784
To get on the same page
about what we'll say, you know?

06:58.786 --> 06:59.951
Coordinate our plan.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.888
Plus, he gave me
a personalized gift.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.958
It would be rude of me...
Not to thank him in person.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.896
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

07:10.898 --> 07:14.433
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Let it be known that jane</i>
<i>went to work that morning</i>

07:14.435 --> 07:16.435
<i>Determined to take</i>
<i>her mother's advice.</i>

07:16.437 --> 07:18.203
<i>She would focus</i>
<i>on her relationship</i>

07:18.205 --> 07:21.907
<i>With michael, and she would</i>
<i>avoid rafael at all costs.</i>

07:23.709 --> 07:25.143
Good morning.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.511
Hey.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.979
Uh...

07:27.981 --> 07:29.014
Hi.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.449
Oh, no.
Oh.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.716
I have a cold.
Oh, okay.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.685
Are you okay?
Have you seen a doctor?

07:33.687 --> 07:35.153
Oh, no, no. It's no big deal.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.588
Just contagious.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.556
So what's up?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.658
Uh, well, <i>ocean drive</i>

07:39.660 --> 07:42.694
Is interviewing a couple
of hotel owners for an article.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.930
Mm-hmm.
Written questions
that the magazine submits,

07:44.932 --> 07:46.698
But then we actually get
to respond to.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.533
I've already done most of them,
but there's one that

07:48.535 --> 07:50.168
I haven't done yet.
I just thought that maybe

07:50.170 --> 07:51.937
Our resident writer would want
to give it a shot...

07:51.939 --> 07:55.474
(rafael's voice fades out;
gentle, romantic music fades in)

07:55.476 --> 07:57.242
Jane?
Yes?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.611
Yes? You'll-you'll write it?

07:59.613 --> 08:00.745
Sure.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.113
Yeah, I'll write it.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.648
I'll e-mail you the questions.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.084
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.552
Okay.

08:08.721 --> 08:09.821
Oh, and when you're writing it,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.790
If you could really try to focus

08:11.792 --> 08:13.725
On the fantasy of it.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.694
You know? Really...

08:15.696 --> 08:18.930
Try to make it... Sexy.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.131
Really sexy, yes.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.566
I got it.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.542
Just wanted to drop off
some ideas for the upgrade

08:30.544 --> 08:31.977
To the recovery spa.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.713
Less greens, more blues,
as discussed,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.882
And I added the screening room,
which was a good call.

08:42.555 --> 08:44.055
Great.
I'll take a look later.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.558
Great, let me know.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.927
Hey, have you heard
from your sister?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.062
I recommended a lawyer to her,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.697
But she didn't show.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.032
Pretty sure
she's on some kind of bender.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.701
What?
I checked the surveillance video

08:56.703 --> 08:58.937
To see who pulled the fire alarm
the other night.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.305
It was luisa,

09:00.307 --> 09:01.907
In a bathrobe,

09:01.909 --> 09:04.276
For no apparent reason.

09:04.278 --> 09:05.777
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Of course, rose knew</i>

09:05.779 --> 09:07.679
<i>The very apparent reason.</i>

09:13.019 --> 09:15.020
(alarm blaring)

09:15.022 --> 09:16.621
Darling!

09:16.623 --> 09:18.857
She's had a lot on her mind.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.692
That doesn't mean
that she's drinking again.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.827
What if something happened
to her?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.130
Trust me,
nothing happened to her.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.998
She disappears when she drinks.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.833
Rafael, there was just
a murder here.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.169
I'm well aware.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.973
Is my father still upset
about zaz's memorial?

09:34.975 --> 09:36.775
I think it's safe to say yes.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.843
(sighs)
I got to go talk to him.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.118
Look, honestly,
you've been great.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.788
The way you seem to care
about my sister...

09:49.790 --> 09:52.324
Well, it's...

09:52.326 --> 09:53.858
Way more than
my other stepmothers did.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.660
Thanks.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.330
Emilio:
<i>"murder at the marbella."</i>

09:58.332 --> 10:00.298
That's what I wake up to
this morning.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.000
Which is we're going
on a media blitz.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.335
We're gonna combat any
negative mentions with...

10:03.337 --> 10:05.604
We could've buried
this whole thing.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.239
Instead, you had to have
a memorial for the guy.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.975
We're at 50% capacity.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.242
Dad, I'm working on that.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.378
Clearly, I need to stick around

10:13.380 --> 10:16.748
To supervise things.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.218
So I brought in
the next best thing.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.221
Rafael.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.689
Lachlan.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.124
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

10:26.126 --> 10:27.626
<i>This is not good at all.</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:29.694
Good to see you.
<i>See, these two</i>

10:29.696 --> 10:30.996
<i>Go way back.</i>

10:30.998 --> 10:32.764
Don't be so moody;
ibiza can wait.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.833
Plus, my dad's about to give
me the keys to the kingdom.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.267
Do you even work?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.203
Real work? No.
That's not for me.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.138
My dad's whipping boy
lachlan gets it done.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.307
Don't you, lachlan?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.109
(tapping glass)

10:44.111 --> 10:45.176
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:45.178 --> 10:47.979
(clears throat)

10:47.981 --> 10:49.280
...It's been a long time coming,

10:49.282 --> 10:50.882
But I would like
to announce

10:50.884 --> 10:52.417
My appointment
for senior vp

10:52.419 --> 10:54.019
Of the maracay hotel group.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.221
Lachlan moore.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.890
(applause)

10:58.892 --> 11:01.960
The marbella is my hotel, okay?
I run this place.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.361
I own 20%.
Yes, and it's part

11:03.363 --> 11:04.963
Of my corporation.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.898
And I'm still
the principal owner.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.234
I don't need
someone overseeing me.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.170
Think of it more
as a collaboration, rafael.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.039
After all, we're on
the same team here.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.042
Priest:
<i>Teamwork is key</i>

11:17.044 --> 11:18.877
To a successful marriage.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.779
You'll hit bumps on the road,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.714
But you'll weather them
together.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.416
You'll become an atv--

11:24.418 --> 11:26.051
All-terrain vehicle.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.986
You hit a bump?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.054
Bam!
It jostles you,

11:29.056 --> 11:30.722
But you'll be okay

11:30.724 --> 11:32.424
Because you'll have all
these really stunning features,

11:32.426 --> 11:36.294
Dual joint suspension,
a reinforced steel frame...

11:36.296 --> 11:38.063
Latin lover narrator: <i>It should</i>
<i>be noted that the parish</i>

11:38.065 --> 11:39.831
<i>Recently gave father ortega</i>
<i>a pep talk</i>

11:39.833 --> 11:42.467
<i>About making himself</i>
<i>more accessible to youth.</i>

11:42.469 --> 11:45.403
See? Just because I'm a priest
doesn't mean I don't get it.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.073
<i>That was a line</i>
<i>they suggested he use.</i>

11:48.075 --> 11:50.308
(both chuckle)
the point is,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.210
Things will get difficult over
the course of your marriage.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.445
They just will.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.246
So, tell me,

11:55.248 --> 12:00.118
Have you faced difficulties
as a couple so far?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.454
Well, there's one thing...
Yeah, there's this
one difficulty...

12:02.456 --> 12:04.889
Go ahead, babe.
Right. Okay.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.393
I'm pregnant
with another man's baby.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.363
I know, you know, I was... It
was a fluke medical accident,

12:12.365 --> 12:14.933
And I was accidentally
inseminated, but...

12:14.935 --> 12:17.268
I'm actually still a virgin.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.237
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>the parish pep talk</i>

12:19.239 --> 12:22.941
<i>Did not prepare</i>
<i>father ortega for this.</i>

12:22.943 --> 12:24.909
So it's been difficult.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.177
So that's why
we're just kind of

12:26.179 --> 12:28.379
Trying to, you know...

12:28.381 --> 12:29.748
Whoa.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.182
Ooh... (chuckles)

12:31.184 --> 12:33.017
Ride past it in the atv.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.252
Ortega:
And to be clear,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.354
You never had

12:36.356 --> 12:38.957
A relationship with the father?
No.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.392
Well, I mean there was one kiss.
But that was years ago.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.428
But there's
no physical connection

12:43.430 --> 12:46.264
Anymore?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.535
No.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.772
Wait, why did you hesitate?

12:53.774 --> 12:56.441
I didn't hesitate.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.909
Did something happen
between you and rafael?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.277
No.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.880
Not consciously.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.781
What does that mean?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.152
I had a dream about him.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.386
What kind of dream?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.321
It was the kind where...

13:10.323 --> 13:11.289
(clears throat)
it was like, um,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.391
A sex dream.
What?!

13:13.393 --> 13:16.327
It was nothing, and I cannot lie
in front of the father.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.797
We're getting married
in six days, and you're
fantasizing about another guy.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.098
That doesn't feel like nothing.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.536
What? Michael...
(door slams)

13:26.806 --> 13:28.807
Michael...

13:28.809 --> 13:30.275
Michael, wait.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.478
I know you're upset.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.914
Can you blame me?
I'm sorry.
It didn't mean anything.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.149
I'm sure it's just because
he's the father. It's...
(phone chimes)

13:38.151 --> 13:42.020
Great. Uh...

13:42.022 --> 13:43.354
I have to get to work.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.890
We'll talk about
your rafael fantasies later.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.260
(sighs)

13:54.834 --> 13:57.235
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Xiomara had certainly</i>
<i>fantasized about her first time</i>

13:57.237 --> 13:58.970
<i>In rogelio's trailer.</i>

13:58.972 --> 14:00.905
<i>The details varied,</i>
<i>but it always ended</i>

14:00.907 --> 14:02.574
<i>With sex in front</i>
<i>of the vanity,</i>

14:02.576 --> 14:03.908
<i>So they could admire</i>
<i>each other's work</i>

14:03.910 --> 14:06.344
<i>From multiple angles.</i>

14:06.346 --> 14:09.147
<i>One detail she didn't imagine?</i>

14:09.149 --> 14:11.983
<i>Yeah. This.</i>

14:11.985 --> 14:13.351
Can I help you?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.855
I'm looking
for rogelio de la vega.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.889
He's not here.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.257
Maybe send a letter next time.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.625
That's what
most fans do.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.527
There are stalker laws,
you know.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.529
I'm not a stalker.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.865
I'm a friend. And who are you?

14:26.867 --> 14:29.167
His manager.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.235
Oh.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.337
And his ex-wife.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.940
My bracelet.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.076
It must have fallen off
when I was packing

14:38.078 --> 14:39.878
Last week's gift baskets.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.547
Listen, this is a personalized
gift from rogelio.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.250
See? Xo. My name.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.018
That's a "x" and a "o."

14:47.020 --> 14:49.120
Like a kiss and a hug?

14:49.122 --> 14:53.892
Honey, he gave that
to me last year.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.960
Look harder.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.531
You're about 24 hours
from being arrested.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.666
Okay, your prints
were all over the room.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.434
You've got cause,
motive...

15:03.436 --> 15:05.136
It wasn't me, okay?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.337
I believe you.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.106
But I got no
other suspects, okay?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.008
So, unless we find something

15:10.010 --> 15:11.175
That points to someone else.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.044
But there isn't anything!
God.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.480
Look, you can't
let them arrest me!
I'll tell them you tampered

15:15.482 --> 15:17.548
With a crime scene. I will!
You don't believe me?
Yeah. I know!

15:17.550 --> 15:19.918
But I can't help you unless
you tell me where you were

15:19.920 --> 15:21.986
The night of the murder.
But I didn't do it!

15:21.988 --> 15:23.521
You need an alibi.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.290
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, but that was a secret</i>

15:25.292 --> 15:29.193
<i>Petra would protect</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

15:32.197 --> 15:33.498
Look... Well...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.933
These are all too small.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.234
It's hard to make out details.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.236
Maybe if...

15:38.238 --> 15:39.938
I don't know, if I was
actually in the room,

15:39.940 --> 15:40.972
It would be a different story.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.013
You should've seen
michael's face.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.715
It was awful.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.050
I'm sure it wasn't
as bad as it seemed.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.718
Oh, look.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.689
Your telenovela
boyfriend is here again.

15:57.691 --> 16:01.059
Honestly, I think he wants you.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.628
No, what he wants

16:03.630 --> 16:04.996
Is iced tea.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.102
Hi.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.638
Beautifully poured.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.041
Thank you so much.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.242
You're welcome.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.611
So, when are you
getting married?

16:20.613 --> 16:21.746
Huh?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.982
Uh, I-I-I noticed the ring.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.650
Oh, um, uh...

16:25.652 --> 16:27.652
Soon, actually--
less than a week.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.153
A week?! Wow!

16:29.155 --> 16:30.355
That's too quick.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.623
I think it's okay.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.158
So, um, I'm gonna go now.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.094
No, I mean...
Don't get me wrong.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.464
I mean, I'm thrilled for you.
Hey, jane!

16:39.466 --> 16:42.133
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Observe jane between</i>
<i>a rock and hard place.</i>

16:42.135 --> 16:44.335
<i>The rock being a weirdly</i>
<i>intrusive telenovela star.</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:46.637
<i>The hard place being...</i>

16:46.639 --> 16:49.674
<i>Rafael's body.</i>

16:49.676 --> 16:53.011
Uh... Hey! Look! It's the guy
from <i>the passions of santos.</i>

16:53.013 --> 16:55.113
(women clamoring)

16:55.115 --> 16:57.482
I just wanted to check in
on the magazine article,

16:57.484 --> 16:58.616
See how it was coming.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.018
I'll be done soon.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.052
And I'll get it to you.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.053
Great!

17:02.055 --> 17:04.055
Um, but you know what?

17:04.057 --> 17:06.124
There was something else that
I wanted to talk to you about.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.025
Okay.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.259
Oh, I-I just figured

17:08.261 --> 17:09.727
That, you know, with, um...

17:09.729 --> 17:11.295
(clears throat)
...The lawsuit

17:11.297 --> 17:13.131
Against your sister and
everything, you know,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.033
It's probably best that
we kept our distance.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.235
Uh, what do you mean?
I just,

17:17.237 --> 17:19.037
You know, um...

17:19.039 --> 17:20.405
Maybe, uh, maybe
all the baby stuff

17:20.407 --> 17:21.806
Can actually go
through petra!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.041
Petra?
Yeah!

17:23.043 --> 17:24.242
(screams)
oh!

17:24.244 --> 17:25.643
(crowd gasping, clamoring)
oh, god!

17:27.479 --> 17:29.047
Jane! Jane!

17:29.049 --> 17:30.782
Are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine!

17:30.784 --> 17:32.283
It's four feet, baywatch!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.118
(laughs)
I'm sorry. I didn't,

17:34.120 --> 17:35.319
I didn't know
if you could swim.

17:35.321 --> 17:38.556
You know I can stand, right?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.059
(both laughing)

17:41.061 --> 17:43.061
You look like cousin it.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.803
Thanks.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.173
Michael:
Jane?

17:56.508 --> 17:58.142
Mi-michael! Oh, no!

18:02.848 --> 18:04.515
Michael, michael!

18:04.517 --> 18:06.717
Michael, please stop!
Michael, please, just stop!

18:06.719 --> 18:10.088
It was not what it looked like
back there with raphael.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.156
I was backing up
and I fell into the pool.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.224
And then he jumped in.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.759
How chivalrous.
No, listen.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.694
I was just talking to him
about putting up boundaries.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.729
From now on, all the baby stuff
is gonna go through petra.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.133
I am doing everything I can
to minimize contact, baby.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.135
Is that supposed to make
me feel better, jane?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.704
That you have to go to these
lengths to avoid this guy?

18:26.706 --> 18:27.705
Is the chemistry
just that intense?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.607
No! No!

18:29.609 --> 18:33.111
I just... I don't...

18:33.113 --> 18:35.580
What do you, what am I
supposed to do, michael, huh?

18:35.582 --> 18:38.182
Okay, how do I fix this?

18:38.184 --> 18:41.252
I love you, jane.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.156
I want to be with you forever.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.125
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This was all true.</i>

18:47.127 --> 18:48.359
And so it broke michael's heart

18:48.361 --> 18:51.129
<i>To have to say</i>
<i>what he said next.</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:53.131
But if you have feelings
for another guy...

18:55.200 --> 18:58.269
...I don't think we should
be getting married.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.876
(sniffs)
no.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.883
I've been very patient.
If my daughter is to be married

19:11.885 --> 19:13.417
In a week, the time has come.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.719
Rogelio...
Xiomara,

19:14.721 --> 19:16.254
She thinks her father
is some soldier.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.488
And not this
critically acclaimed

19:17.490 --> 19:19.457
International superstar.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.592
Should I also tell her that
this international superstar has

19:21.594 --> 19:24.762
His ex-wife send gift baskets
to women he's had sex with?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.397
I would ask that you not.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.466
You met melissa then?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.800
Are you sleeping with her?
She's my ex-wife!

19:29.802 --> 19:31.802
Besides you cannot
expect to be

19:31.804 --> 19:34.739
The only woman to whom I give
the carnal gift of rogelio.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.440
You know what?
I have to go.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.909
No, no! Wait, wait!
I-I'm sorry.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.477
I'm sorry.
Melissa and I were married.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.445
What you and I have is...
Something else.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.847
A chemical spark.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.316
It's... Like
an animal attraction.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.786
So, just sex then?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.288
Oh, don't say it like that.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.856
Excellent sex.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.327
Um, so, yeah,
we're totally happy

19:56.329 --> 19:57.261
With our wi-fi speed,
but thanks.

19:57.263 --> 20:00.331
Hey.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.799
How was your day?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.768
We're confirmed for the bridal
shop tomorrow for 4:00.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.469
Mom, I...

20:05.471 --> 20:07.338
Don't know if there's
even gonna be a wedding.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.607
(gasps) you told him
about the dream, huh?

20:09.609 --> 20:12.643
I had to! I mean,
we were in counseling.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.445
Father ortega was
staring at me.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.314
I mean, I get it.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.949
You know, if this was
the other way around,

20:17.951 --> 20:19.617
If he was fantasizing
about some other girl,

20:19.619 --> 20:20.818
A girl that was pregnant
with his baby...

20:20.820 --> 20:23.221
I'd be devastated!

20:23.223 --> 20:24.322
Mm.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.824
And I love him, mom, but...

20:26.826 --> 20:30.361
Man, I get this feeling

20:30.363 --> 20:33.331
When I'm around rafael...

20:33.333 --> 20:34.532
Honey, honestly...

20:34.534 --> 20:36.334
I think it's
just a chemical thing.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.536
I had that once with someone

20:38.538 --> 20:40.538
And, well, it's easy

20:40.540 --> 20:42.640
To mistake it
for something more.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.543
Are you talking
about my father?

20:45.545 --> 20:46.711
Come on.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.446
You know, I remember
every detail

20:48.448 --> 20:49.480
You told me about him.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.850
And there he was
in his army uniform.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.286
And the minute I
saw him, honey,

20:55.288 --> 20:57.688
Oh, it was like
a chemical thing.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.657
Was he handsome?
(sighs)

20:59.659 --> 21:02.760
The most handsome
man I'd ever seen.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.995
And then what happened?

21:05.931 --> 21:09.767
He gave me a very special hug

21:09.769 --> 21:12.436
Which led to you.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.441
You always wanted
to hear about him.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.610
I was...

21:19.612 --> 21:22.513
I was little, so...

21:22.515 --> 21:24.515
So what do I do, mom?

21:24.517 --> 21:27.685
I don't want to lose michael,
and I told him that.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.320
Yeah, but he has
a mental picture

21:29.322 --> 21:30.788
Of you getting busy
with another man.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.623
Okay, so how do I get rid of
that mental picture in his head?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.625
Oh, it's gonna be hard.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.327
If you were a regular person,

21:36.329 --> 21:37.762
I'd tell you
to go bang him with gusto.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.664
Ma...

21:39.666 --> 21:43.067
So... What's
your version of that?

21:53.478 --> 21:54.979
Come on.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.348
You know what I like.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.016
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane</i> did <i>know what he liked.</i>

21:59.018 --> 22:00.584
<i>Let's be real.</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:02.687
<i>Jane was a virgin,</i>
<i>but not a saint.</i>

22:04.623 --> 22:07.425
<i>And so she started writing...</i>
<i>With gusto.</i>

22:25.544 --> 22:28.446
Rafael, stop.
Look, I know you're stressed.

22:28.448 --> 22:31.048
Of course I'm stressed.
I have lachlan breathing
down my neck.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.917
Okay, so do
something about it.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.819
Push through the
expansion deal.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.654
Show your father that
you have foresight

22:36.656 --> 22:38.522
And business sense.
Enough, petra!

22:38.524 --> 22:41.359
It's none of your business!

22:56.441 --> 23:00.010
Oh, sorry.
Looking for michael.
You just missed him.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.447
Is his bag in there, because
I want to stick something in it?

23:03.449 --> 23:04.815
Yeah, yeah, I'll-I'll
grab it for you.

23:04.817 --> 23:08.419
Thanks.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.788
Man:
Everything all right?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.825
Yeah, fine.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.429
Petra...

23:18.431 --> 23:20.431
You seem upset.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.099
I'm just concerned.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.435
Latin lover narrator
<i>did I forget to mention?</i>

23:24.437 --> 23:27.571
<i>These two go way, way back.</i>

23:27.573 --> 23:29.707
Uh, thank you.
Thank you. I, um...

23:29.709 --> 23:32.476
I'm very excited
about this promotion.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.578
In fact, it's the second
most exciting thing

23:34.580 --> 23:36.547
That's happened this evening.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.549
The first being my engagement.

23:38.551 --> 23:43.421
(applause)

23:43.423 --> 23:45.689
(laughs)
chinchin?

23:45.691 --> 23:48.058
Lachlan:
Chinchin.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.629
(laughing):
Oh, my gosh.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.464
Petra:
Congratulations.
Lachlan: Thank you.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.802
Wow. Unbelievable.

23:59.538 --> 24:02.540
You made a mistake back then.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.875
Maybe I did.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.150
I thought we were
doing better.

24:13.152 --> 24:18.689
I mean, I really thought we'd
make it through all this.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.158
The miscarriage,
his cancer.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.893
I'm sorry.

24:22.895 --> 24:26.230
Oh, please.
You expect me to believe that?

24:26.232 --> 24:29.834
After I ended our engagement
and married him instead?

24:29.836 --> 24:32.136
Let's be straight
with each other at least.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.038
All right, then.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.640
Karma's a bitch.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.109
Better.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.246
What do you want?

24:44.783 --> 24:49.019
I heard you talking to your
husband about an expansion deal.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.955
Maybe I can help...

24:50.957 --> 24:52.957
Facilitate.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.625
Help?

24:54.627 --> 24:56.494
Or make the deal yourself?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.963
Does it matter?

25:00.599 --> 25:03.100
What's in it for me?

25:05.570 --> 25:08.105
I'll do all the things
that I used to do for you.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.741
To you.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.979
I'll pass.

25:14.981 --> 25:18.015
If I'm going to
put the final nail

25:18.017 --> 25:21.585
In the coffin of my marriage,
I want to be cut into the deal.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.954
Fine.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.896
My way would have been
so much more fun.

25:33.732 --> 25:35.299
(gasps)

25:37.903 --> 25:40.004
(speaking spanish)
what are you
doing here?

25:40.006 --> 25:42.306
Melissa told me about the mix-up
with the bracelet.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.074
Ma, get out of here.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.743
(sighs)

25:47.045 --> 25:48.679
I brought you a gift.

25:48.681 --> 25:51.315
It's inscribed.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.222
Xiomara, you are
very special to me.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.624
You're the mother
of my only child.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.026
That I know of.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.761
Mm.
Anyway, I have to go.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.663
We're shooting
this fantasy sequence tonight.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.332
That's why I'm wearing
this ridiculous outfit.

26:10.001 --> 26:12.069
Alba...

26:14.306 --> 26:17.708
Are you wearing
perfume, ma?
Xiomara...

26:23.181 --> 26:24.248
(sighs)

26:29.721 --> 26:31.155
Ma, stop.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.924
I'm going to tell her!

26:34.793 --> 26:37.628
I'm just waiting
for the right time.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.263
I know that!

26:39.265 --> 26:41.966
I just don't want her
to hate me, okay?

26:43.234 --> 26:44.802
(sighs)

26:44.804 --> 26:47.671
When she finds out
that I knew who her father was,

26:47.673 --> 26:49.206
And hid it for so long...

26:50.208 --> 26:52.910
I'm scared, ma.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.746
I... I don't want to lose her.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.827
Board meeting
this afternoon.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.062
What are you talking about?

27:12.064 --> 27:14.131
3:00.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.367
In fact, let's have it in here.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.205
Just give me
some more time, sir.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.073
We must have
missed something.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.842
That's ridiculous! There was
no one else in that room.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.210
What about the drink
with no prints? Huh?

27:26.212 --> 27:27.911
Petra wouldn't wipe down a glass
when her prints

27:27.913 --> 27:29.279
Are already
all over that room.
Enough!

27:29.281 --> 27:30.681
Cordero, you got
one more hour.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.349
Then I'm arresting petra.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.255
This is not a
good time, jane.
Oh, okay.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.424
Sorry, it's just
been a couple hours,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.693
And you didn't say anything.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.161
About what I left in the bag?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.263
You mean the article you
wrote about the hotel?

27:47.932 --> 27:50.367
(sighs)

27:57.275 --> 28:00.044
(gasping)

28:05.917 --> 28:08.385
(gasping):
Excuse me...

28:08.387 --> 28:10.387
(gasping)

28:10.389 --> 28:13.190
We should talk.
Hm...

28:18.463 --> 28:20.464
Rafael, let me just explain
something really quickly.
No. I get it. I get it.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.800
We've been... We've been
getting closer, and I do.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.302
Okay, but that's not what I...
I feel very connected to you

28:25.304 --> 28:27.705
As the mother
of my child, and-and...
Okay, but this is...

28:27.707 --> 28:30.107
And you are clearly
a talented writer, jane.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.410
I mean, you have depicted things
in remarkably vivid detail.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.980
But, uh, this caramel scenario--
it's not gonna happen, jane.

28:36.982 --> 28:41.185
I wrote that for michael...
My fiancÃ©.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.821
Oh.
Yeah.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.323
Well, that makes...
That makes sense.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.792
Yeah.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.127
I'm so sorry.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.296
It's okay. It's okay.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.332
I... I got to be honest--
I was totally freaking out.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.434
I thought I was gonna have
to explain to you how I just

28:57.436 --> 29:00.170
See you like a sister.
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ouch.</i>

29:00.172 --> 29:03.207
And I do.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.976
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See, that's the thing</i>
<i>about fantasies--</i>

29:05.978 --> 29:08.078
<i>They can vanish as quickly</i>
<i>as they appear.</i>

29:08.080 --> 29:09.413
Can I get the letter back?

29:09.415 --> 29:12.216
Oh. Yes, of course.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.084
Well, that's fine.
Oh, yeah.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.054
Just take that.
Yeah.

29:18.223 --> 29:22.760
Officially, you were
never here, okay?

29:22.762 --> 29:25.129
But just look around.

29:25.131 --> 29:29.500
Is there anything you see
that's unusual, out of place?

29:33.204 --> 29:36.807
(knocking on door)

29:39.110 --> 29:41.078
What are you doing here, jane?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.147
Jane: I have, uh, something
that I want to give you?

29:43.149 --> 29:45.849
This is not a good time.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.251
Yeah.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.019
You know what?
It never is.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.255
But it'll be quick.
I said it's not
a good time, jane.

29:51.257 --> 29:54.124
What don't you understand
about that?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.560
You know what?
That's... Enough.

29:56.562 --> 29:59.096
Yes, I had a sex dream
about rafael,

29:59.098 --> 30:00.831
But I realized
that those strange feelings

30:00.833 --> 30:02.432
I was having--
they weren't real.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.868
And I think the only reason
why I've been feeling them is

30:04.870 --> 30:06.837
Because I feel so distant
from you.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.939
Because you've
been acting all...

30:08.941 --> 30:10.974
I-I don't know, weird, since
this pregnancy thing happened.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.976
Detached
and preoccupied.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.112
This is not exactly
an easy thing, jane.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.514
Yeah, well, marriage isn't
exactly an easy thing.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.183
Didn't you listen
to the priest?

30:19.185 --> 30:22.119
There are gonna be bumps
in the road,

30:22.121 --> 30:25.122
And we have to be able
to get through them together.

30:25.124 --> 30:28.225
And so far, with this baby,

30:28.227 --> 30:30.360
It doesn't feel like we have.

30:31.596 --> 30:35.165
And that's heartbreaking,
michael.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.268
And it's really scary.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.037
Because I love you.

30:42.207 --> 30:45.342
And I really want to marry you.

30:45.344 --> 30:49.413
But only if things go back
to the way they were.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.257
Did you find
anything?

31:00.259 --> 31:01.291
No, nothing.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.292
Look harder!

31:02.294 --> 31:03.293
Stop yelling at me.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.428
I'm trying
to help you.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.063
Oh, please.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.298
(scoffs) you're doing
this for yourself.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.601
If my marriage ends, jane won't
give the baby to rafael,

31:10.603 --> 31:12.269
And then you'll
end up with it.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.637
Which is the last
thing you want.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.372
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This was true.</i>

31:15.374 --> 31:17.274
<i>Michael had thought</i>

31:17.276 --> 31:19.276
<i>That was absolutely</i>
<i>the last thing he wanted.</i>

31:19.278 --> 31:21.245
So, figure something out.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.013
You're the detective here,
not me.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.316
And tell the brutes
in your department,

31:26.318 --> 31:28.485
They'll be reimbursing us
for all the damage they've done.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.433
(phone chimes)

31:53.344 --> 31:54.978
Look, it's clear.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.014
A perfect fit.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.982
And the cart is coated
in the same gold paint

31:58.984 --> 32:00.317
That's on the wall.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.352
Bellboys must bang into walls
all the time.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.087
Sure, but in
the surveillance shot,

32:04.089 --> 32:05.422
Just minutes before the murder,

32:05.424 --> 32:08.425
The dent and the paint
weren't there.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.328
Okay, so what about
your glass with no prints?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.597
Bellboys wear gloves, nadine.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.934
We need to look
in to all the bellboys

32:16.936 --> 32:18.635
Working that night.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.606
Good call.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.241
What's wrong with you?

32:24.243 --> 32:26.076
You should be making
your damn gloating face.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.344
Why aren't you happy?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.279
I am.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.514
Latin lover narrator:
<i>He's not.</i>

32:32.951 --> 32:35.452
<i>And here's why.</i>

32:47.165 --> 32:48.332
(laughs)

32:57.542 --> 32:59.543
Brown eyes or blue eyes?

32:59.545 --> 33:01.511
Beautiful brown.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.280
What was his
favorite food?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.282
Grilled cheese,

33:05.284 --> 33:06.650
Just like you.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.453
I wish I could meet him.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.289
I know, baby, I know.

33:19.063 --> 33:21.298
Are you okay?

33:24.635 --> 33:27.637
I just want things to go back
to the way they were before.

33:27.639 --> 33:31.341
Yeah, I know the feeling.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.414
Huh?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.024
(speaks spanish)

33:47.026 --> 33:49.059
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But what none of them knew</i>

33:49.061 --> 33:52.496
<i>Was that someone else wanted</i>
<i>to be part of the fun as well.</i>

33:55.767 --> 33:57.467
Lachlan: <i>In conclusion,</i>
<i>it would be foolish</i>

33:57.469 --> 33:59.336
To ignore
this expansion opportunity.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.338
The upsides are tremendous.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.373
Any thoughts?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.441
Yes, actually.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.443
What lachlan's proposing
completely

34:06.445 --> 34:08.445
Fails to account
for zoning ordinances

34:08.447 --> 34:10.213
And environmental impact.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.782
Under my proposal,

34:11.784 --> 34:13.784
We can address these issues

34:13.786 --> 34:15.419
While maximizing tax incentive

34:15.421 --> 34:17.487
To triple our revenue.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.459
Please, turn your attention
to the screen.

34:22.461 --> 34:25.328
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Though lachlan could think</i>
<i>only of petra...</i>

34:25.330 --> 34:26.463
Push through the expansion deal.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.697
<i>Show your father that you have</i>

34:27.699 --> 34:29.266
<i>Foresight and business savvy.</i>

34:31.469 --> 34:34.171
Latin lover narrator:
<i>... Who had screwed him</i>
<i>once again,</i>

34:34.173 --> 34:36.373
<i>And not the way he liked.</i>

34:36.375 --> 34:37.841
A toast to watching lachlan

34:37.843 --> 34:39.810
Fumble his way
through a proposal

34:39.812 --> 34:42.379
That you've been
fine-tuning for weeks.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.814
No, no, no, no.
To you, petra.

34:43.816 --> 34:46.316
(chuckles)
I don't know how you do it.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.185
How did you get him
to trust you?

34:48.187 --> 34:50.087
He never suspected a thing.

34:50.089 --> 34:51.488
But it's a brilliant strategy.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.190
To make someone think
that you're allies

34:53.192 --> 34:54.491
Until you get what you want.

34:56.227 --> 34:57.561
I mean...

34:57.563 --> 34:59.229
(chuckles)

35:01.466 --> 35:03.600
Mmm.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.337
So, how long were you sleeping
with zaz, anyway?

35:07.339 --> 35:09.306
What?!

35:09.308 --> 35:10.640
We're done, petra.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.544
But thank you for helping
with lachlan.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.458
Michael:
Uh, where's jane?

35:28.460 --> 35:30.227
Michael?
Xiomara: Michael, stop.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.461
It's bad luck.
I'm not gonna look.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.230
I just need
to talk to her, okay?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.498
Hey, jane, can I come in?
Wait, don't...

35:34.500 --> 35:36.233
Wait, don't look!
I'm not...

35:36.235 --> 35:37.767
I'm walking in backwards.
Not gonna look.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.436
Just walking in backwards.
Coming in; here we go...

35:39.438 --> 35:41.505
Okay, I will, too.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.342
What are you doing here?

35:45.344 --> 35:46.443
I needed to talk to you.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.411
(sighs)

35:48.413 --> 35:50.413
You're right, jane.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.149
What you said.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.284
This baby has come between us,

35:54.286 --> 35:57.287
And I was thinking about why
and the things I've done.

35:57.289 --> 36:00.724
And I realized that it-it
all stemmed from one thing.

36:02.460 --> 36:05.328
I have just been so afraid
that you would want to keep it.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.365
That I'd have to raise
some other guy's kid,

36:08.367 --> 36:11.635
And that, seriously, that felt
like worst-case scenario to me.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.740
(sighs)
but it's not.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.844
Worst-case scenario
is losing you.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.346
Oh...
But it's not just some
other guy's baby.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.714
It's yours, too,

36:24.716 --> 36:26.750
And if you want it,
I am all in.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.418
(chuckles)

36:28.420 --> 36:29.686
We'll figure this out together.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.621
We're gonna, we're gonna
do this together.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.856
Baby, I don't want to keep it.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.858
I know, but I'm just saying
if you did.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.459
Whatever you want, jane,

36:36.461 --> 36:37.627
I'm here, okay?

36:37.629 --> 36:38.662
Whatever you want.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.564
(sighs)

36:40.566 --> 36:42.566
Can I just say...

36:42.568 --> 36:43.934
How incredibly hard it is for me

36:43.936 --> 36:45.869
Not to turn around
and kiss you right now?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.671
Right. Man!

36:47.673 --> 36:49.606
I need some prize
for my self-control.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.775
You know...

36:51.777 --> 36:54.277
I do have a little prize
for you.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.779
A letter

36:55.781 --> 36:56.947
That...

36:58.783 --> 37:00.283
...Took a little detour, but...

37:00.285 --> 37:01.551
Wait, let me just double-check.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.553
And, yep, that, yep, good.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.388
(sighs)

37:05.390 --> 37:07.490
(whispering):
I love you.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.493
I love you.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.596
Luisa, it's me.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.364
Rose.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.667
Look, I don't know
where you are,

37:17.669 --> 37:21.504
If you're drinking,
if you're okay,

37:21.506 --> 37:24.841
But you need to come home.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.643
Look, I-I spoke to your lawyer,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.845
And there's gonna be
a pre-trial motion in two weeks,

37:28.847 --> 37:30.347
And if you don't show up,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.549
Jane will get
a default judgment.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.784
Rafael will lose
his share of the hotel.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.731
Latin lover narrator: <i>I am sure</i>
<i>the linguists among you</i>

37:47.733 --> 37:49.899
<i>Have picked up on this,</i>
<i>but they are speaking czech.</i>

38:08.719 --> 38:10.887
<i>"natalia..."</i>

38:10.889 --> 38:13.790
<i>The secret she was protecting</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

38:15.660 --> 38:17.727
(whispering in spanish)

38:19.463 --> 38:21.531
(gasps)

38:22.667 --> 38:24.734
Oh...

38:25.670 --> 38:28.071
Oh...

38:28.073 --> 38:30.340
(speaking spanish)

38:33.678 --> 38:34.911
Don't, ma.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.613
(speaking spanish)

38:36.615 --> 38:38.081
Stop, grandma.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.683
(girls cheering)
rogelio:
Gracias, si.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.584
<i>Muchos gracias, gracias.</i>

38:41.586 --> 38:43.720
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>
<i>(speaking spanish)</i>

38:43.722 --> 38:45.655
Thank you, thank you very much.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.890
Thank you and good-bye.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.659
I'm sorry.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.728
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.396
Uh...

38:53.398 --> 38:54.698
I-I didn't mean
to cause a scene.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.334
I-I wanted to watch
from a distance.

38:57.336 --> 39:00.337
Wait, why did you want
to watch from a distance?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.905
How did you even know
we were here?

39:01.907 --> 39:03.807
Foursquare.
You check in everywhere.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.743
Wait, you guys know each other?

39:06.745 --> 39:08.645
Yes, we-we, um,

39:08.647 --> 39:11.047
Did musical theater together.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.116
(sighs)

39:14.719 --> 39:16.353
Tell her.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.422
Jane, uh, please,

39:19.424 --> 39:20.724
Sit.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.826
Okay, mm-hmm.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.767
You're not gonna...

39:30.769 --> 39:32.402
Kidnap me and hold me for ransom

39:32.404 --> 39:34.437
In a cave quickly filling
with water, are you?

39:34.439 --> 39:35.638
So you watch the novela, then.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.973
Yeah...
Of course you do.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.074
It's a spectacular hit.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.477
Gotcha.
Excuse me, excuse me,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.412
I'm sorry, I-I-I'm nervous.
I'm nervous.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.647
It's a big moment,
and now that it's here,

39:44.649 --> 39:46.683
I find myself unsure
on how to proceed.

39:46.685 --> 39:49.786
Well, why don't you start
by telling me why you're here?

39:49.788 --> 39:51.955
Yes, yes, I will do that.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.757
I-I-I... (grunts)

39:53.759 --> 39:55.892
I'm your father.

39:56.627 --> 39:57.460
What?

39:57.462 --> 39:58.595
I'm your father.

39:58.597 --> 39:59.763
No, I heard you.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.930
Yeah, but you said "what,"

40:00.932 --> 40:02.432
So I thought you didn't.

40:02.434 --> 40:03.733
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

40:03.735 --> 40:04.868
<i>The when xiomara told jane</i>

40:04.870 --> 40:07.604
<i>Her father was an army guy...</i>

40:07.606 --> 40:09.639
<i>This is not what</i>
<i>jane had in mind.</i>

40:13.644 --> 40:16.045
(panting):
You're...

40:16.047 --> 40:17.781
You're really my father?

40:19.116 --> 40:21.151
Yes, I-I went to school
with your mother

40:21.153 --> 40:22.485
When we were young.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.192
You...

40:29.194 --> 40:31.428
You knew...

40:31.430 --> 40:33.663
You knew who my father was?

40:33.665 --> 40:36.900
I'm sorry, honey.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.437
All this time...

40:40.439 --> 40:42.739
Oh...!

40:42.741 --> 40:46.509
You knew who my father was,

40:46.511 --> 40:49.078
And you didn't tell me?

40:49.080 --> 40:51.614
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Like I said,</i>

40:51.616 --> 40:54.517
<i>You never really see</i>
<i>a broken heart coming.</i>

40:58.689 --> 41:00.824
I want you guys to go.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.592
I want you to go! Go now!

41:10.835 --> 41:13.002
(sniffles)

41:16.740 --> 41:19.075
(sobbing)

41:32.223 --> 41:34.224
Latin lover narrator:
<i>That night in bed,</i>

41:34.226 --> 41:36.226
<i>Jane lay awake,</i>

41:36.228 --> 41:38.261
<i>Thinking about how</i>
<i>she'd been betrayed.</i>

41:38.263 --> 41:40.563
(sighs)

41:40.565 --> 41:43.199
<i>Soon, she prayed for sleep.</i>

41:45.102 --> 41:46.236
(moaning)

41:46.238 --> 41:48.905
<i>But dreams betray,</i>
