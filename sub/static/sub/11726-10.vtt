00:14.215 --> 00:17.549
Man:
<i>The accused, Nathan Hale,</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:20.019
<i>having been found guilty
of espionage</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:23.756
<i>and treasonous conspiracy against
His Majesty King George III,</i>

00:23.758 --> 00:26.792
<i>shall hereby
be executed as a spy</i>

00:26.794 --> 00:31.430
on this day
the 22nd of October, 1776.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.134
If the condemned
has any last words,

00:35.136 --> 00:37.703
<i>let him speak them now.</i>

00:38.639 --> 00:40.439
I only regret

00:40.441 --> 00:43.776
that I have but one life
to lose for my country.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.170
Wait there!

01:11.172 --> 01:13.272
Come here.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.713
( grunting )

01:25.252 --> 01:27.219
( grunts )

01:28.656 --> 01:30.189
( shouts )

01:30.191 --> 01:31.657
Richard:
<i>Stop!</i>

01:31.659 --> 01:34.093
Stop!
What is this madness?

01:34.095 --> 01:38.664
This fiend just raided the garrison
and assaulted an officer... me.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.432
This is murder.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.102
Stand back, old man, or I'll
see you up this tree as well.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.304
I am magistrate
of this town, Captain,

01:45.306 --> 01:48.874
<i>charged with upholding the
rights of the king's subjects.</i>

01:48.876 --> 01:52.211
And those rights state
that no man

01:52.213 --> 01:54.546
shall be condemned
without trial.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.884
Falkoff.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.460
Justice may only be
delivered by the just.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.230
Perhaps what this town
needs is a new magistrate.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.232
I stand only for the law,
nothing more.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.767
If my son has committed crimes,
let him stand trial for them.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.437
- A trial where you sit as judge?
- No.

02:18.439 --> 02:22.174
If the crimes are committed
against army persons or property,

02:22.176 --> 02:24.343
then the case falls
to martial law

02:24.345 --> 02:26.445
and the highest ranking
military officer will sit.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.748
But as this case
involves colonists,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.917
you would be obliged
to prosecute for the Crown.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.286
Isn't that correct, Magistrate?

02:35.389 --> 02:38.357
You're damn right it is.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.363
Put the prisoner
in the stockade.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.732
( gasping )

02:46.734 --> 02:49.201
And construct a gallows
up there on the hill

02:49.203 --> 02:51.270
<i>for one
where the last one stood.</i>

02:51.272 --> 02:54.306
<i>I want it built to exact
military specifications.</i>

02:57.745 --> 02:59.545
We're going to do this properly.

Courier: <i>Colonel Hamilton,
dispatch from one of our gunboats.</i>

04:30.871 --> 04:32.938
<i>( object clatters )</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:47.936
Peggy's voice:
<i>You have drawings of me,</i>

04:47.937 --> 04:50.017
<i>but I have nothing
to remember you by.</i>

04:55.329 --> 04:57.896
- Arnold has made good on his escape.
- Caleb: Damn it!

04:57.898 --> 04:59.498
He boarded the Vulture,
which sailed off

04:59.500 --> 05:01.400
before our guard boats
could arrive.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.402
He sent these ashore first.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.926
We must secure West Point.

05:10.927 --> 05:13.411
Nathaniel Greene will assume command
of the fort, effective immediately.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.348
Have Colonel Jameson
and David Franks arrested

05:16.350 --> 05:19.084
and transport Major André to the main
army away from potential rescue.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.720
Yes, sir.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.389
We must endeavor
to keep this quiet.

05:24.391 --> 05:27.693
Your Excellency, I'm afraid
that may prove difficult.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.662
<i>( Peggy screams )</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:33.065
<i>- ( crashing )
- ( screaming )</i>

05:38.539 --> 05:42.541
Who are you?
Where is he?

05:42.543 --> 05:43.642
Where is who?

05:43.644 --> 05:46.845
My husband.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.614
He's gone.
Gone!

05:49.616 --> 05:52.451
- Yes, we know, madam.
- He's gone forever.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.120
He's there.
He's there.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.922
The spirits have
taken him up there.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.523
They have...

05:58.525 --> 06:01.993
oh, they have put
hot irons in his head.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.663
- Mrs. Arnold, just...
- Oh, they've...

06:04.665 --> 06:06.565
oh, they've...

06:06.567 --> 06:08.633
they've... they have
put them on me.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.436
- Oh, they have put... oh, they have put them on me!
- Madam! Madam!

06:11.438 --> 06:13.972
- They have put them on me!
- It's all right, madam. It's all right.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.674
To the bed.
To the bed.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.642
- Only Washington can take them away.
- Shh.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.746
- Only Washington!
- I'm here.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.449
Peggy: <i>No, you are
not</i> Washington.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.585
You are the man in the fire.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.554
- She's in hysterics.
- In the ceiling!

06:29.556 --> 06:31.490
- Fetch the doctor.
- Peggy: <i> Benedict!</i>

06:31.492 --> 06:35.026
( whimpering, stuttering )
Benedict!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.530
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

06:43.871 --> 06:46.438
Reading up on martial
law, are we?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.174
I hope you don't mind if I sup
while you prepare your case.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.977
I do mind.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.679
But it's not a problem.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.114
I will repair to my study.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.983
You mean my office?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.551
I'd rather you not.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.621
Captain, the lady
wants a word with you.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.689
By all means, let her come down.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.592
He already has, but he
couldn't explain to me

07:07.594 --> 07:09.828
why it was necessary I be
imprisoned in my room.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.530
Well, ask your
father-in-law.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.199
It was he who requested
you be confined to quarters.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.001
<i>I'm merely honoring his request.</i>

07:16.003 --> 07:18.503
You are sequestered,
not imprisoned.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.572
I plan to call on you
as a witness.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.073
To testify against Abraham?

07:22.075 --> 07:25.143
To testify to the truth.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.179
What gives you
the right to judge...

07:27.181 --> 07:29.181
His Majesty the King.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.850
And his right is given him
by Almighty God.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.521
God will judge you.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.090
Actually, he's just
prosecuting the case.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.592
Wakefield will serve as judge

07:40.594 --> 07:44.029
as he is Royal Army
and I am mere Ranger.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.165
And witness, too, I hope.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.134
And who will stand for Abraham?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.902
Who will defend him?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.839
Abraham has elected
to stand for himself.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.208
<i>- ( hammering )
- ( men chattering )</i>

08:04.718 --> 08:06.952
( chatter )

08:11.925 --> 08:13.959
André: <i>The plan was to
lead</i> the invasion force

08:13.961 --> 08:17.028
around to the rear of Fort Putnam
and overwhelm the garrison.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.964
General Arnold would send
for reinforcements

08:18.966 --> 08:20.999
and then surrender
before they could arrive.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.968
I would assume
control of West Point

08:22.970 --> 08:25.504
while General Arnold would wait
to surprise the reinforcements

08:25.506 --> 08:27.506
led by you, sir.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.910
When did the correspondence begin
between yourself and General Arnold?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.812
The first inquiry
was in September

08:33.813 --> 08:37.115
and done through Arnold's
contacts on the black market.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.751
<i>Smugglers, as they are, pledge
true allegiance to coin.</i>

08:40.754 --> 08:43.188
I don't know how much Arnold paid the
fellow to drop a letter through my door

08:43.190 --> 08:46.825
but it must have been enough that he
didn't break the seal and read it.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.229
And he acted alone?

08:51.231 --> 08:53.164
Far as I know, yes, sir.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.634
<i>I don't believe that his aide-de-camp
was aware of our conspiracy</i>

08:55.636 --> 08:58.003
nor poor Colonel Jameson.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.771
Or Arnold's family,
for that matter.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.808
Yes, I received a letter
from Arnold saying as much.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.545
<i>In it he asks mercy
for his poor wife</i>

09:06.547 --> 09:09.814
whom he abandoned and
begs that she be spared

09:09.816 --> 09:12.284
the mistaken vengeance
of her country.

09:15.022 --> 09:19.024
I have made it known that it would
be exceedingly painful to me

09:19.026 --> 09:23.194
if Mrs. Arnold were not to be
treated with the greatest kindness.

09:23.196 --> 09:26.298
<i>He betrayed her
as much as his country.</i>

09:26.300 --> 09:28.033
I wish it were not so
that the innocent

09:28.035 --> 09:29.901
often suffer most in war.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.242
Are there any other questions
I might answer, sir?

09:37.244 --> 09:40.245
Sir, regarding sources
and contacts...

09:40.247 --> 09:42.347
Not today.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.623
Then may I trouble you
for a request, sir?

09:51.625 --> 09:55.026
- Of course.
- May my servant be cleared to visit from New York

09:55.028 --> 09:57.162
and bring with her
a fresh uniform

09:57.164 --> 10:01.600
so that I may stand trial
properly as a soldier?

10:01.602 --> 10:04.736
Colonel Hamilton will see to it.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.672
André:
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

10:07.674 --> 10:09.774
I fully expect the tribunal
to find me guilty

10:09.776 --> 10:12.143
and to recommend my execution.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.845
I beg of you to allow
that sentence

10:13.847 --> 10:16.715
to be carried out by firing
line rather than the gallows.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.150
<i>One is a fate
befitting an officer</i>

10:19.152 --> 10:20.885
<i>and the other
is meant for a spy.</i>

10:20.887 --> 10:24.089
I am an officer
dedicated to service

10:24.091 --> 10:28.660
<i>and stained with no action that
can give me cause for remorse.</i>

10:28.662 --> 10:31.096
I wish the mode of my death
to reflect this.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.734
I will consider it.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.871
Thank you, sir.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.948
<i>( knocks )</i>

10:56.823 --> 11:00.025
- Major André isn't home.
- We are aware.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.028
This place as good as any
for your lodgings

11:03.030 --> 11:05.964
until we've determined
what's to be done with you.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.932
I do not require comfort, sir,

11:07.934 --> 11:10.402
only the opportunity
for service.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.904
As soon as I'm provided
with uniform and regiment,

11:12.906 --> 11:15.774
I will deliver upon my promise.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.842
May I inquire as to my new rank?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.110
No, you may not.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.714
Sir, will Major André
be returning home soon?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.716
Major André has been
captured by the enemy.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.685
Efforts are underway
to secure his return.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.219
Allow me to lead
those efforts, sir.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.755
Washington's army is vulnerable.
I know their weaknesses.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.457
<i>I can redraw the
fortifications at West Point.</i>

11:32.459 --> 11:34.926
- It's likely he's been moved by now.
- <i>( knocks )</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:38.763
And the defenses strengthened
in the wake of your defection.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.432
Sir.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.801
We've received a dispatch
from General Washington.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.804
- I rode first to your headquarters...
- Yes, yes, hand it over, lad.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.241
- What are you doing?
- Completing my rounds, sir.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.011
I collect Major André's
correspondence each day.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.447
Anything for me?

11:55.449 --> 11:57.916
- Well, I...
- Sort through.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.218
See if there is post
intended for me

12:00.220 --> 12:02.754
since I am standing right here.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.258
Just cut through
the red tape, man.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.137
He's going to try
André as a spy.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.172
That's absurd.
He is an officer.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.075
He proposes an exchange.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.244
For prisoners?

12:26.246 --> 12:29.264
For you.

12:29.265 --> 12:32.283
<i>He writes since you are the
author of this mischief,</i>

12:32.285 --> 12:34.986
you ought more properly
to be the victim.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.757
Well, that is... that...
this will not stand.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.158
We will not stand for this.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.762
I will draft a personal
response to this attack.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.865
Courier: <i>There is
nothing for you sir.</i>

12:59.846 --> 13:01.479
André's voice:
<i>"To General Clinton,</i>

13:01.481 --> 13:04.983
<i>I can conclusively report
that Agent Culper</i>

13:04.985 --> 13:07.886
<i>is Abraham Woodhull
of Setauket."</i>

13:07.888 --> 13:09.954
( hammering )

13:20.066 --> 13:23.268
Richard:
<i>Who is Abraham Woodhull?</i>

13:23.270 --> 13:25.236
Some assembled here may know him

13:25.238 --> 13:27.539
as a friend, a Christian,

13:27.541 --> 13:30.141
an adulterer, a criminal,

13:30.143 --> 13:33.812
a husband or a son.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.814
Or you may not know him at all.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.016
I will show
that Abraham Woodhull

13:38.018 --> 13:40.885
<i>committed crimes
against the Crown.</i>

13:40.887 --> 13:44.055
First, by the attempted
theft of army property.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.192
Second, by conspiracy
to commit insurrection.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.228
And third, by the
assault of an officer.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.334
( clears throat )

13:56.336 --> 13:59.204
Abraham Woodhull,

13:59.206 --> 14:01.539
you have heard
the charges against you.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.174
How do you plead?

14:04.377 --> 14:07.111
<i>( people whispering )</i>

14:11.117 --> 14:13.585
The prisoner stands mute.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.858
The, uh... the Crown
calls Elias Appleby

14:19.860 --> 14:21.960
<i>as its first witness.</i>

14:21.962 --> 14:25.396
He meant to get the guns
that were taken from us.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.568
That we turned over.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.971
Did he say how
he planned to do this?

14:32.973 --> 14:36.007
No, sir.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.042
Your witness.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.313
( people murmuring )

14:47.888 --> 14:49.654
Thank you,
Mr. Appleby.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.059
The Crown calls
Jeremiah Scroggins.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.128
I remember him saying,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.931
"Without gunpowder,
there is no freedom."

14:59.933 --> 15:03.134
And what was his temperament

15:03.136 --> 15:05.003
<i>when he uttered this venom?</i>

15:05.005 --> 15:08.239
He was vicious, nearly
foaming at the mouth.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.941
If the firelocks
had been loaded,

15:09.943 --> 15:11.676
I fear I wouldn't
be sitting here today.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.077
And what happened then?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.113
I informed him
he was under arrest

15:15.115 --> 15:17.248
and requested
he surrender peacefully.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.318
<i>He answered with a fist
aimed at my wounded ear.</i>

15:20.320 --> 15:22.353
<i>- It hurt very badly.</i>
- Richard: <i> And that</i> will be all.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.088
Captain Simcoe.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.092
On the 23rd of May, 1777,

15:28.094 --> 15:30.995
a musket round was fired at
Judge Woodhull on his property.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.630
The bullet nearly killed him.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.099
Did you order Corporal
Eastin to fire that shot?

15:35.101 --> 15:38.069
- ( murmuring )
- <i>( gavel bangs )</i>

15:38.071 --> 15:41.406
The prisoner will restrict
his interview to this case.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.943
More recent, then. Do you deny
torching Appleby's barn and livestock

15:44.945 --> 15:48.079
along with Herman Weaver's cordwood
and Jonas Gullet's hayfield?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.048
- Your Honor!
- ( bangs gavel )

15:50.050 --> 15:51.482
The prisoner may present
evidence of the truth.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.351
The truth of the matter.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.354
The matter being the charges
brought against you here.

15:56.356 --> 16:00.024
If you wish to present names,
make them of your coconspirators.

16:02.729 --> 16:06.397
The prisoner may present
evidence of the truth.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.133
Rivington: <i>Surely this must
herald the end don't you think?</i>

16:09.135 --> 16:10.668
The end?
The end of what?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.236
The bloody rebellion, Jonathan.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.072
The bloody...

16:14.074 --> 16:16.474
Benedict Arnold tries
to nab 3,000 Yanks

16:16.476 --> 16:19.477
and comes over
with two bargemen.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.146
He's a rat who didn't
get the cheese.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.016
The ship must be near sinking
when the rats are leaving it.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.418
- Don't you agree, Townsend?
- Absolutely.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.221
- ( laughs ) Here's what I know...
- Yeah.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.423
<i>( door opens )</i>

16:36.363 --> 16:38.696
- <i>Robert!</i>
- Father.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.099
Didn't know you were coming.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.401
Haven't heard from you
in quite some time.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.373
Well, I thought we might
have a word in private.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.376
Really?
About what?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.344
You know what.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.423
Do you know that man?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.558
( shouts )

17:07.560 --> 17:09.594
( chatter stops )

17:16.770 --> 17:20.438
Go see what that was about, yes?

17:20.440 --> 17:23.141
You truly are a glutton
for punishment.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.376
- Robert.
- After everything they did?

17:25.377 --> 17:29.347
For the cause, we shall freely
give up our bodies for sacrifice.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.817
This is not about them, Robert.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.319
It's about something
greater than them and us.

17:42.762 --> 17:47.432
Lord, lettest thou thy
servants depart in peace.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.070
We have sacrificed
enough, Father.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.407
He knows that.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.209
Rivington:
<i>Townsend.</i>

17:58.211 --> 18:00.411
Come break your vow
and have some rum.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.480
I think I will.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.289
<i>( glasses clink )</i>

18:14.727 --> 18:16.527
Washington: <i>It should
come</i> as no surprise

18:16.529 --> 18:18.629
<i>that in light of General
Arnold's defection,</i>

18:18.631 --> 18:21.866
the future of our cause
lies in peril.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.602
As I assess the true
strength of our army,

18:24.604 --> 18:27.338
I must reassess
our chains of intelligence.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.640
Yes, sir.
General Arnold

18:29.642 --> 18:32.510
is undoubtedly aware
of the alias Culper,

18:32.512 --> 18:36.280
though he does not know
his true name or location.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.349
We have no reason to believe
that he even suspects

18:38.351 --> 18:40.284
the presence of Culper Jr.,
though he does know

18:40.286 --> 18:42.453
that our chain extends
as far as New York.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.123
Does it still?
Lieutenant Brewster?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.625
We ain't heard from Culper Jr.
since he warned us about Tryon.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.861
I did tell him that
our door was still open

18:49.863 --> 18:51.462
and he alone had the key.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.830
Place an ad in the "Gazette"

18:52.832 --> 18:54.298
and I'll come rowing out to you.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.134
Do you think he will?

18:56.136 --> 18:59.237
Well, if I had to place a wager
on it, sir, no, I don't.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.539
What about 355?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.908
Since the capture
of Major André,

19:03.910 --> 19:07.845
I do not think we can expect any
new discovery from Abigail.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.915
<i>Major Tallmadge has informed me</i>

19:10.917 --> 19:15.453
that André has requested his servant
bring his uniform from New York.

19:15.455 --> 19:19.524
I humbly submit that if Abigail
is allowed to cross the lines,

19:19.526 --> 19:22.426
we should secure for her
the emancipation

19:22.428 --> 19:24.896
she was promised in Setauket.

19:24.898 --> 19:28.866
<i>It's the least we can do to show our
gratitude for her service in our cause.</i>

19:28.868 --> 19:31.602
But would her deed then be transferred
to another royal officer?

19:31.604 --> 19:34.705
I mean, perhaps we can establish a
new channel between her and Culper.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.208
- We need to bring Culper in as well.
- Yeah.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.410
It's not safe for him, sir. There
are so many eyes on him now.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.580
A mistake for me to cut him from the
chain, but he must remain there.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.616
So you would spare
André, but not Abe?

19:47.887 --> 19:52.256
Colonel Hamilton told me about your
offer to exchange André for Arnold.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.891
Arnold is a traitor.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.893
André was merely doing his duty.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.396
I would trade a thousand
Andrés for Arnold.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.598
Nathan Hale was doing
his duty, sir,

20:00.600 --> 20:02.233
and they hanged him as a spy.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.535
Hale? Hale was captain
in our militia.

20:04.537 --> 20:08.306
André is Adjutant General
of the British Army.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.741
He does not hang
without consequences.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.246
May I request that Lieutenant
Brewster and Mrs. Strong

20:15.248 --> 20:16.948
be excused before
I respond, sir?

20:16.950 --> 20:20.251
No, owing to the value of
truth, let them be present.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.387
Very well. The consequences
are upon us now.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.956
In the wake
of Arnold's treachery,

20:24.958 --> 20:26.958
the men are reluctant
to trust their officers.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.593
Officers doubt their commanders.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.562
An example must be made
to restore that order.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.331
This is about
doing what is right.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.600
( scoffs )

20:35.602 --> 20:39.370
Neither of you ever have a
chance to meet Captain Hale?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.938
- No, sir. No.
- No, sir.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.574
Benjamin's beloved
classmate from Yale.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.509
As a friend, you knew him
better than most.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.945
Do you remember his final words?

20:47.947 --> 20:51.682
"I only regret that I have but one
life to lose for my country."

20:51.684 --> 20:55.720
From the drama "Cato," except he didn't
write them and he never said them.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.690
We did.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.393
When I received the report from
General Howe's aide-de-camp,

21:02.395 --> 21:05.263
it described Hale behaving
with great resolution.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.398
Before hanging, he said
he thought of the duty

21:07.400 --> 21:09.700
of every good officer
to obey any orders

21:09.702 --> 21:11.702
given him by his
commander-in-chief.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.573
He wished to be seen
as a soldier,

21:15.575 --> 21:17.441
not a spy.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.745
We altered what he said

21:20.747 --> 21:23.481
and thus converted
a failed mission

21:23.483 --> 21:25.583
into an act of martyrdom.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.787
The truth that links
Hale and André

21:29.789 --> 21:33.991
is they were both captured on their
very first mission undercover.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.361
Woodhull has been surviving
under his for years.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.630
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

21:51.377 --> 21:53.311
You've done an excellent
job, Magistrate.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.612
I think it's time
you rest your case.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.047
I have more evidence to present.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.748
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were

21:57.750 --> 22:00.451
deliberately drawing out the
case longer than needs be.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.353
Since the outcome is inevitable,

22:02.355 --> 22:07.858
I wonder is it out of
sentiment or cruelty?

22:08.027 --> 22:10.428
The Crown calls Mary Woodhull.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.766
Richard: <i>You are married</i>
to the prisoner?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.036
I am wife to Abraham Woodhull.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.372
And how did you come
to be wife to him?

22:23.076 --> 22:25.476
I was first engaged
to his brother Thomas.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.846
The dowry for which was settled
with me by your father John Blake.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.582
Yes.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.784
And why did you not wed Thomas?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.489
Because he died in New York.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.592
During the Liberty Pole Riots.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.061
<i>While he was fighting
for his king and country</i>

22:44.063 --> 22:46.630
<i>against the so-called
Sons of Liberty.</i>

22:46.632 --> 22:49.600
But you did not break
that contract.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.902
Instead, you married Thomas's
younger brother Abraham

22:51.904 --> 22:53.604
<i>under the laws of coverture.</i>

22:54.674 --> 22:56.741
Abraham proposed.

22:56.743 --> 23:00.745
( clears throat ) What is the
point of this, Magistrate?

23:00.747 --> 23:04.115
That Mary Blake Woodhull is a woman
who holds to her obligations.

23:04.117 --> 23:06.450
And as those obligations
multiplied by inheritance,

23:06.452 --> 23:08.419
<i>by property, by motherhood,</i>

23:08.421 --> 23:11.389
she had to be loyal to Abraham
even as he grew disloyal.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.790
I witnessed no act of treason.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.594
I meant to you,
not to the Crown.

23:16.596 --> 23:20.498
Everyone knows he was adulterous
with that harlot Anna Strong.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.767
<i>And I myself remember
the months you spent</i>

23:22.769 --> 23:24.668
living away from him
bringing up your child.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.504
How could you witness treason?

23:26.506 --> 23:29.473
I love my husband and I
will stand by him now.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.777
If he broke the law, it was done from
a need to protect those he loves,

23:32.779 --> 23:34.912
to protect the town
that he loves from you.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.915
- Sit down!
- It is Judge Woodhull who gave Captain Simcoe your names.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.418
The fields that were burned were
from a list that he wrote up.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.453
- I saw him do it.
- The witness is excused.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.955
He was in a scheme with Major Hewlett
to sell off crops to the Royal Army.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.458
That's enough! I am not
the one on trial here.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.926
Perhaps you should be.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.829
- I know you gave me up!
- The attainders were illegal!

23:51.831 --> 23:55.699
- Dismiss the witness.
- ( bangs gavel )

23:57.136 --> 23:59.503
The court will consider
that Major André

23:59.505 --> 24:01.806
travelled upriver
under a flag of truce.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.909
When his vessel departed without
him, he proceeded on foot

24:04.911 --> 24:07.144
and was caught out
in the neutral ground...

24:07.146 --> 24:09.513
that is, between enemy lines

24:09.515 --> 24:12.450
and not in American-held
territory.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.452
He does not meet
the status of a spy

24:14.454 --> 24:18.889
according to the "Laws
and Ordinance of War."

24:18.891 --> 24:22.460
The board has studied the letters
of General Arnold and Sir Clinton

24:22.462 --> 24:25.496
and have determined that there
was no valid flag of truce.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.566
Furthermore, Major André was
travelling in disguised habit

24:28.568 --> 24:29.934
and under an assumed name.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.203
He carried with him
incriminating papers

24:32.205 --> 24:34.171
given to him by a known traitor.

24:34.173 --> 24:37.475
<i>The recommendation of this
tribunal is that Major André</i>

24:37.477 --> 24:39.577
<i>ought to be considered
a spy from the enemy</i>

24:39.579 --> 24:42.179
<i>and that, agreeable to the
law and usage of nations,</i>

24:42.181 --> 24:44.915
<i>it is our opinion
that he suffer death.</i>

24:46.586 --> 24:48.552
( bangs gavel )

24:56.696 --> 25:00.231
Sir, the board did not speak to
the manner of his execution.

25:00.233 --> 25:05.503
Yes, they left that to my discretion
and it remains complicated.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.639
<i>This arrived inside
a packet from Sir Clinton.</i>

25:08.641 --> 25:11.208
<i>It is written from Arnold to me</i>

25:11.210 --> 25:15.012
<i>threatening retaliation to American
prisoners under their power.</i>

25:18.217 --> 25:20.584
<i>"Should this warning
be disregarded...</i>

25:20.586 --> 25:22.953
<i>I shall call upon heaven
and earth to witness...</i>

25:22.955 --> 25:25.923
<i>you will be accountable
for the torrent of blood</i>

25:25.925 --> 25:27.958
that may be spilled
in consequence."

25:35.234 --> 25:37.568
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

25:40.940 --> 25:42.806
<i>( knocks )</i>

25:48.781 --> 25:51.015
Sir, my apologies.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.250
My house servant and her boy seem
to have gone off without leave.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.653
"A torrent of blood"?

25:55.655 --> 25:58.289
Did you threaten
to slaughter 40 hostages

25:58.291 --> 25:59.790
if Washington harms André?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.759
Washington seeks my ruin.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.894
He threatened first
when he offered the trade.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.663
I meant to make
our position clear.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.897
Our position?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.899
We do not murder
prisoners of war

26:08.901 --> 26:12.570
and you do not speak
for the king, ever.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.874
And just to make
my position clear,

26:16.876 --> 26:19.643
I would trade you
with André in a heartbeat

26:19.645 --> 26:22.112
if my hands were not tied.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.114
We do not trade defectors,

26:24.116 --> 26:26.817
for it would
discourage new ones.

26:30.690 --> 26:34.758
And she is not
your house servant.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.761
She is André's. And I have
sent her across the lines

26:37.763 --> 26:39.897
with his uniform at his request.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.801
I understand, sir.
He deserves that.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.102
He deserves more than that.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.005
So do I. I apologize
for my letter,

26:48.007 --> 26:49.940
but I am a warrior,
not a diplomat.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.009
Allow me a uniform
and let me fight.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.011
Give me a command and I
will give you victory.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.384
You will be made
a brigadier in our service.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.020
- Any higher rank would offend our generals.
- But that is a demotion.

27:03.022 --> 27:06.023
You shall be allowed to raise
a regiment of Loyalists,

27:06.025 --> 27:09.627
though it remains to be seen whether
any man will fight under a turncoat.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.000
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

27:16.002 --> 27:18.702
( chatter )

27:21.974 --> 27:23.674
Abigail.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.912
I'm so glad they let
you take Cicero.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.181
I told them he's the one who
always shaves Major André's beard,

27:31.183 --> 27:33.183
so they wrote him into the pass.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.186
Abi, listen to me.
You don't have to go back.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.857
- But the pass is only for...
- Lots of things get lost on the road.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.659
You don't have to go back.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.193
And you don't have to stay here,

27:43.195 --> 27:45.429
though you're welcome to
for as long as you like.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.064
Thank you.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.767
It's you who deserves
to be thanked.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.836
- Both of you.
- You remember Ben from Setauket.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.740
I'll show you to Major André.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.678
Would you like to see the camp?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.112
I've got to tell you
about the letter.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.447
What letter?

28:15.061 --> 28:17.094
Abigail.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.130
How good to see you.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.866
I brought your uniform.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.702
Thank you.

28:25.971 --> 28:29.707
I, um...

28:29.709 --> 28:32.310
apologize.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.912
It seems I won't be able
to make it home after all.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.180
I'm sorry.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.117
You mustn't cry.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.152
( crying )

28:44.156 --> 28:45.989
It's not your fault.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.732
Major, after you're dressed,

28:54.734 --> 28:56.200
I will escort you to the site.

28:59.171 --> 29:02.506
<i>- ( rooster crows )
- ( footsteps approach )</i>

29:03.743 --> 29:05.109
( gasping )

29:05.111 --> 29:06.910
Morning!

29:06.912 --> 29:08.846
Closing statements.

29:15.821 --> 29:18.255
( horses neighing )

29:25.097 --> 29:27.464
This is an excellent likeness.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.833
Did you study portraiture
back in Europe?

29:29.835 --> 29:32.469
Major Tallmadge, allow me
to say that it's an honor

29:32.471 --> 29:33.971
to properly make
your acquaintance.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.809
<i>I wonder if you might
indulge my curiosity.</i>

29:38.811 --> 29:41.111
Do you remember the first
time you heard my name?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.080
Oh, I remember it well.

29:43.082 --> 29:46.483
It was a brisk Thursday,
January of '77.

29:46.485 --> 29:50.854
Mr. Nathaniel Sackett,
a friend of mine,

29:50.856 --> 29:54.158
he was telling me how he had managed to
place a man within your inner circle

29:54.160 --> 29:56.026
<i>posing as a Coldstream Guard.</i>

29:56.028 --> 29:59.530
That man was later killed
by a knife to the throat,

29:59.532 --> 30:01.799
as was Mr. Sackett.

30:01.801 --> 30:05.836
I would like you to accept my
personal apology for Mr. Sackett.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.205
My orders to Lieutenant Gamble

30:08.207 --> 30:11.275
were to avoid violence
at all costs.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.243
I accept.

30:13.245 --> 30:16.213
Though I will not apologize
for the punishment

30:16.215 --> 30:18.248
that Lieutenant Gamble
received in kind.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.185
Gamble knew well the risks
of our particular business.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.922
I suppose that Sackett
knew the risks as well.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.257
I must say that he was
quite impressed

30:27.259 --> 30:30.360
with the ruse that you concocted
with Sutherland and Shanks.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.130
A master stroke,
he would have called it.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.165
Hardly.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.101
I sometimes wonder if Sackett

30:38.103 --> 30:40.571
would have seen right
through Benedict Arnold.

30:40.573 --> 30:43.841
Arnold was a failure.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.445
Culper is the master stroke.

30:50.950 --> 30:54.184
<i>Seeing as I'm about to take
a vow of eternal silence,</i>

30:54.186 --> 30:57.454
who was Culper's contact
in York City?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.292
I had a classmate
in Yale College

31:02.294 --> 31:04.561
by the name of Nathan Hale.

31:04.563 --> 31:07.264
<i>I followed him
into the army in '76.</i>

31:07.266 --> 31:10.601
He was tracked and caught
by Robert Rogers

31:10.603 --> 31:13.237
and subsequently
hanged as a spy.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.274
And you think his case
and mine are alike?

31:17.276 --> 31:21.111
He did his duty for his country.

31:21.113 --> 31:24.147
You did yours for your king.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.619
And I want you to know that
I see the honor in both.

31:28.621 --> 31:31.021
Then you're mistaken.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.091
I didn't do it for the king.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.492
I did it for a woman.

31:40.332 --> 31:45.002
That is the loss I regret
more so than my own life.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.210
( bangs )

31:53.212 --> 31:55.012
Called to order.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.180
<i>All parties present?</i>

31:58.250 --> 31:59.383
Dada.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.285
<i>( Wakefield clears throat )</i>

32:01.287 --> 32:03.921
Does the Crown or the prisoner

32:03.923 --> 32:05.956
have any closing
statements to make?

32:05.958 --> 32:08.325
Yes, Your Honor.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.360
( clears throat )

32:12.932 --> 32:17.067
Are these... are these final
statements of a lengthy nature?

32:17.069 --> 32:19.136
Mine shall take
quite some time, yes.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.038
Then the prisoner
will proceed first.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.073
The prisoner? The Crown
should speak first.

32:23.075 --> 32:27.978
<i>Your Honor, I beg you, hold to the
practice and the procedure...</i>

32:27.980 --> 32:30.714
<i>( voice fades )</i>

32:38.691 --> 32:40.357
Richard:
<i>...proper justice.</i>

32:40.359 --> 32:42.225
I killed him.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.397
I killed Thomas.
I killed my brother.

32:47.399 --> 32:51.668
I killed...
I killed Thomas.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.403
I started the riots
at King's College.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.672
It was a prank that went
wrong, but I started it.

32:55.674 --> 33:00.410
I felt responsible... responsible
for his life, so I took it.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.080
I took his intended.
I took his inheritance.

33:03.082 --> 33:06.149
I took his good Tory name,
but it wasn't me.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.253
It was never me, and...

33:12.291 --> 33:14.191
You ask who I am.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.693
I don't know.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.996
I buried that man
along with my brother.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.998
I thought that maybe
one day I'd meet him again

33:21.000 --> 33:23.066
in the soul of the son
that I named after him.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.102
And on that day
I'd tell him that I lied.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.270
Then I lied to try and make
things right, but it didn't work.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.007
It didn't work.

33:31.343 --> 33:36.246
But I can't lie anymore.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.486
And as for these crimes that
I'm accused of committing...

33:44.256 --> 33:46.356
my only regret is that I
didn't commit them sooner.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.628
Right.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.533
( bangs gavel )

33:56.535 --> 33:58.268
Guilty.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.337
Death by hanging.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.280
( band playing )

34:42.081 --> 34:43.847
( horse whinnies )

34:52.424 --> 34:56.092
This is illegal, a lynching!

34:58.831 --> 35:00.797
Captain Wakefield.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.800
Ensign Meadows.
Scout, 27th Foot.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.335
Colonel Cooke
is en route and wishes...

35:05.337 --> 35:07.204
Captain Wakefield
is otherwise engaged.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.539
Whatever your business is,
it can wait.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.815
If death takes too long,

35:18.817 --> 35:21.518
we may pull down on the
legs of the condemned

35:21.520 --> 35:23.720
in order to speed along mercy.

35:38.137 --> 35:42.305
<i>♪ Well,
was it worth it? ♪</i>

35:44.643 --> 35:48.612
<i>♪ Was it worth

<i>♪ The horrors of war? ♪</i>

35:58.390 --> 36:03.160
<i>♪ The loss of life? ♪</i>

36:16.208 --> 36:18.542
It'll be but a momentary pang.

<i>♪ I saw a man ♪</i>

36:55.614 --> 36:57.914
( clears throat )

36:57.916 --> 37:02.385
The accused, Abraham Woodhull...

37:02.387 --> 37:06.590
...having been found guilty
of espionage against America,

37:06.592 --> 37:10.594
shall hereby
be executed as a spy.

37:10.596 --> 37:14.631
<i>If the condemned has any last
words, let him speak them now.</i>

37:23.742 --> 37:26.610
I pray that you all
bear me witness

37:26.612 --> 37:28.845
that I meet my fate
like a brave man.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.433
( choking )

37:51.703 --> 37:55.639
( shouts, gasping )

38:08.587 --> 38:11.054

- ( shouting )
- ( gasping )

38:44.589 --> 38:46.389
( groans )

38:48.593 --> 38:51.561
Help!
Help me!

38:53.732 --> 38:55.732
Help me!

39:00.706 --> 39:03.573
Shoot every man
that stands at the gallows.

39:05.077 --> 39:08.745
Men, present arms!
Take aim at the Rangers.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.046
Ranger:
<i>Captain.</i>

39:10.048 --> 39:12.682
<i>Captain Simcoe, look there, sir.</i>

39:15.053 --> 39:17.120
I told you Colonel
Cooke was en route.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.522
<i>( thuds )</i>

39:33.071 --> 39:35.472
John Graves Simcoe!

39:35.474 --> 39:37.540
Rangers at attention.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.911
Explain yourself, Captain.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.414
We're hanging a traitor, sir.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.849
Not that, man.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.617
Explain your wanton destruction

39:47.619 --> 39:49.886
of one's cordwood, of one's hay,

39:49.888 --> 39:52.489
sheep, and horse.

39:52.491 --> 39:56.693
( stuttering ) Those fields belonged
to men sheltering criminals, sir.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.395
They belonged to me!

40:01.166 --> 40:02.766
To the army.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.472
I think your talents ought to
be put to better use elsewhere,

40:09.474 --> 40:12.675
<i>perhaps the front where
you can destroy the enemy</i>

40:12.677 --> 40:15.645
rather than our own resources

40:15.647 --> 40:17.814
<i>or good Tory neighbors.</i>

40:17.816 --> 40:21.151
The Rangers are needed to protect
the people of this town.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.186
There have been frequent raids.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.955
People of Setauket,

40:25.957 --> 40:28.158
do you feel protected
by this man?

40:28.160 --> 40:31.428
- All: No!
- Man: <i> We don't!</i>

40:31.430 --> 40:33.696
( gasping )

40:38.837 --> 40:41.671
Those names, those fields,

40:41.673 --> 40:44.541
and DeJong to take the message

40:44.543 --> 40:47.210
after I blocked
your correspondence.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.647
I underestimated you,
Magistrate.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.884
So it was sentiment.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.956
Get out of my town,

40:59.958 --> 41:03.560
you pathetic amateur.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.667
Captain Simcoe, clear the field.

41:17.542 --> 41:20.477
Rangers, fall in.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.793
( gasping )

42:00.752 --> 42:03.019
( murmuring )

42:08.593 --> 42:10.593
Mrs. Arnold.

42:19.638 --> 42:22.639
His thoughts were
with you in the end.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.945
Now, it's only a matter of time

42:28.947 --> 42:31.814
before your role in all
of this is discovered.

42:35.053 --> 42:38.621
I suggest you cross the lines
as quick as you can manage.

42:43.695 --> 42:45.762
Why?

42:50.869 --> 42:53.069
Rivington: <i>"When the
epic strain</i> was sung,

42:53.071 --> 42:55.772
<i>the poet by his neck was hung,</i>

42:55.774 --> 42:58.775
and to his cost
he found too late,

42:58.777 --> 43:02.745
the dung-born tribe
decides his fate."

43:03.815 --> 43:05.882
Our André will be avenged.

43:05.884 --> 43:07.850
All:
Hear, hear!

43:13.725 --> 43:16.759
- ( men muttering )
- Is that Arnold?

43:19.331 --> 43:21.364
Man:
<i>Turncoat...</i>

43:23.068 --> 43:25.935
Mr. Rivington.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.137
Brigadier General
Benedict Arnold

43:28.139 --> 43:31.040
at your service, sir.

43:31.042 --> 43:32.942
I wish to publish
a proclamation,

43:32.944 --> 43:34.844
"To the Inhabitants
of America."

43:36.014 --> 43:38.615
Can you afford the space, sir?

43:38.617 --> 43:40.817
That is, after all
the ink you purchased

43:40.819 --> 43:44.020
to publish your exoneration
by the American court.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.189
( men laughing )

43:49.828 --> 43:52.395
I can afford that and more.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.803
Drink.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.140
Whatever's cheapest.

44:04.142 --> 44:08.344
Here you are, sir.
Our best ale on the house.

44:08.346 --> 44:10.346
Do you know who I am?

44:10.348 --> 44:13.383
I believe so, sir.

44:13.385 --> 44:15.718
I read the "Gazette."

44:15.720 --> 44:17.920
Don't believe
everything you read.

44:19.190 --> 44:21.891
Some claim my defection
a failure.

44:21.893 --> 44:23.893
They don't know
our plans were betrayed

44:23.895 --> 44:27.163
by a treacherous ring
of rebel spies.

44:27.165 --> 44:30.366
Oh, that story was not printed.

44:30.368 --> 44:33.202
It was their young leader
who sabotaged me.

44:33.204 --> 44:35.672
He'll come to regret that.

44:35.674 --> 44:38.741
I'll find his spies wherever
they lie in their filth

44:38.743 --> 44:40.810
and I'll drag them
screaming to the gallows.

44:40.812 --> 44:42.779
Then you can read about that.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.949
No one will ever know the
true measure of my sacrifice.

44:49.888 --> 44:52.789
It is difficult
to measure sacrifice.

44:54.125 --> 44:56.426
Often it seems to me

44:56.428 --> 45:00.463
that it is a road with no end.

45:00.465 --> 45:03.032
Of course there's an end.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.801
The end is death.

45:15.413 --> 45:17.246
Mr. Rivington.

45:17.248 --> 45:20.817
What is it, Townsend?

45:20.819 --> 45:23.219
I'd like to buy
an advertisement.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.891
<i>( music playing )</i>
