Halftime comes,

03:05.160 --> 03:07.606
the marching band is supposed to play
America, the Beautiful.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.890
This fucking nut,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.482
he does a solo of the <i>Tiger</i> Rag.
I mean, on the tuba.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.090
(LAUGHING)

03:15.160 --> 03:16.605
ZAK: Who pulls a stunt like that?

03:16.680 --> 03:19.331
You know, people think it's easy,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.165
but to march and to carry that thing...

03:22.240 --> 03:23.730
No, no, no, the physicality, right?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.643
I mean, you gotta be in shape, right?

03:25.720 --> 03:27.563
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.564
So, after high school, what then?

03:30.640 --> 03:33.246
Uh, CCA.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.451
California College of the Arts.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.931
- Good school.
- Oh, yeah...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.923
- That's a good school.
- Nice campus.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.809
Yeah, you know, it's in Oakland.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.441
Oakland. KEWB, channel 91.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.329
K.O. Beachin. Great DJ.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.811
My son just graduated from there,

03:49.880 --> 03:52.167
so, he's a legacy.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.210
Your son a Grand Funk fan?

03:54.280 --> 03:58.046
Uh, yeah. He likes all the bands.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.451
We'll set him up with some tickets.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.646
And you, your wife.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.206
Sounds great. That sounds great.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.281
- Yeah.
-(ZAK CHUCKLES)

04:08.320 --> 04:10.402
Yeah, yeah.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.045
This isn't good.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.089
Well, I mean, now it's filled out properly,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.447
but your account balance

04:18.519 --> 04:20.921
is precipitously low.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.606
Yeah, no, that's why we need
to borrow some money.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.924
Yeah, I understand,
but the loan-to-value ratio,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.650
it skews negatively

04:31.040 --> 04:34.726
and you have, well, no meaningful collateral

04:34.800 --> 04:39.840
and minimal revenue coming in.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.763
Our sales figures are up.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.922
Yeah, we got a hit
climbing the charts right now.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.446
- Hocus Pocus.
- Right, yeah, it's a song by Focus.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.965
- It's all over the radio.
- Focus.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.008
Maybe my son knows it.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.286
I've...

04:51.880 --> 04:53.291
ZAK: Allen.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.570
There's nothing you can do?

04:55.640 --> 04:57.483
Old times' sake?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.927
Wish I could help. I really do.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.482
But there's too many

05:08.560 --> 05:10.562
imponderables.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.164
You really had to stamp it?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.844
Yeah.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.083
This is a friend?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.730
Once a putz, always a putz.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.131
I'd like to stick that tuba up his ass.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.885
You lose 90 grand of our money
up some broad's snatch...

05:31.960 --> 05:34.008
- You never fucked up?
- No, not like that!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.844
Really? How about we poll
your three ex-wives?

05:35.920 --> 05:38.730
Basta, both of you. He feels bad enough.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.848
Yeah, and how do you feel?
Do you even give a shit anymore?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.160
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Hey!

05:42.240 --> 05:43.685
It's our sixth fucking bank.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.921
We shouldn't even be in this position.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.525
MAN: What the hell's wrong with you?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.807
-Either of you guys carrying?
-Really?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.530
- What?
- We're standing on the brink,

05:50.600 --> 05:51.726
you're gonna do coke?

05:51.800 --> 05:53.962
- I need to focus.
- On what, our impending doom?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.525
On straightening shit out.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.250
I built this company using drugs.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.163
When I got sober,
that's when everything got fucked up.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.730
- That's a convenient interpretation.
-(SKIP LAUGHS)

06:00.800 --> 06:02.165
Drug use, okay.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.208
Drug use, not abuse.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.726
I need it to focus.
Keeps me on top of my game.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.723
And besides, Sigmund Freud,

06:08.800 --> 06:11.246
Thomas Edison, Sherlock Holmes,

06:11.320 --> 06:12.890
they all thrived using cocaine.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.086
Sherlock Holmes is not a real person.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.685
- Give me the fucking coke!
- All right, all right!

06:15.760 --> 06:18.081
Take it. Take it, it's light.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.125
Hey, can I get a ride to 49th?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.043
I need privacy. I've got to call Devon.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.688
How much of this shit are we gonna take?

06:27.080 --> 06:29.128
(MUSIC PLAYING)

06:35.920 --> 06:38.491
Fine. What?

06:44.800 --> 06:47.883
A dick. Two dicks. The map of Italy.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.009
And finally, the actual logo for Volkswagen.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.525
This is a boomerang.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.926
I know a dick when I see one, Hal.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.401
Yes, I'm sure you've seen plenty.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.126
- Excuse me?
- I said I'd have them tweaked, okay?

06:59.200 --> 07:00.850
What did Richie think of my launch proposal?

07:00.960 --> 07:01.961
I didn't give it to him.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.441
- What? Why? Are you kidding me?
- Am I smiling?

07:04.520 --> 07:07.842
Look, I am trying to stay professional, here.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.126
Then do professional work.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.288
This is a solid proposal.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.203
It's gonna be a hell of a party.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.127
If you want to change your image,
you don't just get a new shirt, honey.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.682
We must be an assault on the past.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.526
It's like you purposely made a list
of every shitty idea.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.364
Balloons? Snacks?

07:26.440 --> 07:28.124
Cakes in the shape of records?

07:28.200 --> 07:31.522
Guess what, Hal.
Cakes are already in the shape of records.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.921
They do sound, we do picture.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.641
And the picture has got to be like
nothing anyone has ever seen before.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.485
Fashion models, drag queens, midgets.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.005
I know it's hard to understand a hip party

07:42.080 --> 07:45.163
if you've never been invited to one, but Jesus.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.683
I have been doing this job

07:47.760 --> 07:49.410
since you were picking out your prom dress!

07:49.480 --> 07:51.847
Yes, it's the Peter Principle.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.605
You've risen to the level
of your incompetence.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.169
Who the hell do you think you are?

07:57.240 --> 07:59.288
- I'm done talking about this.
- Well, I'm not.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.011
You're a sweet guy, Hal,
which is why you've hung on this long.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.923
But with me here, you're a redundancy.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.163
(LAUGHS) I think you're confused.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.642
I'd only be a true redundancy,
if I used to fuck Richie, too!

08:09.720 --> 08:11.529
Two weeks' severance,
with a recommendation.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.647
What?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.444
- Penny, where's Richie?
- In the studio with the Bits.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.204
You think you can actually fire me?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.328
- Where are we on Veiniacs?
- You can't fire me.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.164
- They're in Boston till the weekend.
- Call their manager.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.208
Tell him all new acts
are playing the launch party.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.726
- No exceptions.
- Richie loves me.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.325
Not as much as me.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.250
Now clean out your desk
before I call security.

It's a sea shanty.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.328
Makes me want to eat a can of spinach.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.885
(IMITATES POPEYE'S LAUGH)

09:29.960 --> 09:32.486

Lay it down. One take, move on.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.923
That's all the songs they got.

This is the band gonna
lead us into the future?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.929
You were never on board with these guys.

Hey, Richie.

Man, uh, you've had, like,
15 hours on credit, you know?

09:57.040 --> 09:59.725
I got Paul Leka and Harry Chapin waiting.

You guys are opening for the New York Dolls

how fucking huge that is?

You need to reach up your asses,

10:53.280 --> 10:54.930
and find another song.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.331
Well, if you're spending
so much time up there,

10:56.400 --> 10:57.686
why don't you just take a peek?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.211
Good one.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.841
Now, write me a lyric half as clever as
that one, with the music to go with it.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.409
When I heard your demo,

11:06.960 --> 11:08.883
it stopped me in my tracks.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.044
It was raw, hard,

11:11.120 --> 11:14.602
it connected me to your world,
your experiences,

11:14.680 --> 11:16.125
fucked up as they are.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.083
Crime, relationships, drugs, sex,

11:20.200 --> 11:22.009
all the madness of this city.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.570
It was like a fucking soundtrack.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.764
Like it or not, you're the face of the new label.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.084
And if you don't deliver,
there won't be a new label.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.565
I don't need a hit, guys.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.571
I need a Nasty Bits song.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.165
Now.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.885
So, let me guess, you sang in a choir.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.531
GARY: I didn't sing until Victor
asked me to join Karisma.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.888
That thing's not trained?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.371
Anyone can sing.

Well, well, I work in the record business,
yeah, so, I'm not <i>so</i> sure of that. (CHUCKLES)

12:07.000 --> 12:09.731
Well, everyone should sing.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.450
Again, I work in the business.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.131
I mean, I know it sounds silly,
but there's an energy there.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.487
- A connection with the crowd.
- Yeah.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.245
It's like this flow. Electricity or something.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.086
This psychic high that
courses through my body.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.003
We're like this giant organism.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.527
Me and them, connected through the music.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.289
It's me alone onstage and the audience,

12:38.400 --> 12:43.088
this massive, worshipful entity.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.005
I sing,

12:46.080 --> 12:47.684
and they belong to me.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.887

12:51.240 --> 12:53.004
(CHUCKLES) Where'd you come from?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.804
(CHUCKLES) Massapequa.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.609
Gary, Scott Levitt.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.444
He's the counsel for
American Century Records.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.648
Hey, how you doing?
Absolute pleasure. How are you?

13:01.040 --> 13:02.610
Did you bring the contract?

13:03.360 --> 13:04.964
What? Yes, I do.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.204
Okay, Gary, here's the short of it.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.367
I've been in this business
longer than you've been alive.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.841
(LAUGHS)

13:16.120 --> 13:18.009
What I heard at Karen's Bat Mitzvah,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.365
that's the real thing.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.047
Gary Giombetta, you're gonna
remember that cheese melon thing

13:24.520 --> 13:26.249
as the first meal you ate

13:27.160 --> 13:29.288
as an American Century artist.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.930
My album, would it open like a, you know...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.729
Like a gatefold, sure. Yeah.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.162
But first, we're gonna develop you.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.561
Change your name, maybe. Work on the look.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.291
- I love what you got here.
- Great stuff.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.010
But we're gonna maybe
lean into Ziggy a little.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.047
Great, yeah.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.124
ZAK: Not a knockoff,
but dress for the job you want, right?

13:55.560 --> 14:01.602
I am gonna personally oversee the creation,
distribution and promotion of all your work.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.004
- You wanted one of these?
- ZAK: Yes.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.401
- Oh, this is perfect.
- You want one, too?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.604
Oh, sure, why not? For the file.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.249
GARY: I dreamt of this meeting all night.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.129
When I woke up...

14:15.640 --> 14:17.608
This just flowed out of me.

14:19.480 --> 14:24.008

HEATHER: American Century.
How may I direct your call?

15:18.320 --> 15:21.722
I'm sorry, Hannibal is no longer
an American Century artist.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.643
Yes, I believe he is married.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.688
I can't help what journalists ask about.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.003
And your meeting with Skip is in an hour.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.445
Why isn't there any music playing?

15:33.520 --> 15:35.409
Stylus broke.
But Casper went out to Colony...

15:35.480 --> 15:37.369
Tell them to put the radio on. And find Clark.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.283
- Devon call?
- No, but you do have a visit...

15:39.360 --> 15:42.489
- I left three goddamn messages...
- There he is!

15:45.560 --> 15:47.528
Find Clark.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.730
Oh, the Focus song picked up spins,
so, thank you for that.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.325
That ain't why I'm here.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.811
I know why you're here.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.726
Listen, she needs a little work,
but I'm setting her up with Shadow Morton.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.644
You know, produced The Shangri-Las,
Janis Ian.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.451
- Doing a girl group right now.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.409
Nora. Your girlfriend.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.323
- Fuck Nora.
- What?

16:16.400 --> 16:18.482
- What do you mean?
- She's ancient history.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.642
I tossed her like a fucking bowling ball.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.326
She had a horrible voice.
What, are you fucking deaf?

16:24.720 --> 16:27.166
Hey, cops came to see me.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.204
Two dicks from the NYPD.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.489
- About Buck Rogers.
- When was this?

16:33.560 --> 16:37.849
They know that the three of us
were at the Oasis.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.843
They talk to you?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.809
What? No.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.770
No, I mean, somebody dropped off
a business card, but that's it.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.764
I got them at bay. I lawyered up.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.649
I advise you to do the same.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.370
But doesn't that make you look guilty?

16:51.440 --> 16:53.124
Me? Us, Richie. Us.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.730
You fucking killed him.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.167
- You smashed his fucking head in.
- What are you talking about?

16:57.240 --> 17:00.961
They know that you were at Buck's house
the night he was fucking murdered.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.684
- Yeah, I have an alibi.
- Good for you.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.809
But if I go down,
I am not gonna drown by myself.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.444
Listen to me, the only reason I was at Buck's

17:07.520 --> 17:08.851
was because you demanded that I be there.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.526
I saved your fucking life,
now they think I did it.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.647
But you did. You killed him.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.808
You don't remember smashing his face in?

17:15.880 --> 17:17.882
- I had to pull you off his back.
- I was defending myself.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.247
- Like a fucking enraged animal.
- Are you out of your mind?

17:20.319 --> 17:22.686
- Oh, you don't fucking knock?
- I did.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.171
I thought you said to come in.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.286
Use your head.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.209
That's all I'm gonna tell you, Richie.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.845
- Give it.
- What do you...

17:36.920 --> 17:39.571
Drop the fucking Eddie Haskell routine
and give it up.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.561
More.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.164
Come on. Fucking more.

Seeing our connection.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.365
Jamie introduced me.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.927

I'm still keeping my ears open for bands,

<i>You know it's all right</i>

47:43.720 --> 47:46.291
<i>Gypsy queen</i>

47:48.640 --> 47:53.202
<i>Oh, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la</i>

47:55.320 --> 47:59.530
<i>Dance, dance
Dance the night away</i>

48:02.040 --> 48:06.125
<i>Oh, la, la, la, la

48:09.080 --> 48:11.686
<i>Come OH, come OH, come OH</i>

48:12.600 --> 48:14.602
You want some coffee or something?

48:15.480 --> 48:17.403
DETECTIVE 2: We got a soda machine, too,
if it's working.

48:17.480 --> 48:20.324
I'm good. Sure you're okay?

48:23.160 --> 48:24.685
Tareyton.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.411
14 years. Luckies before that.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.562
Those are my brands. Then I quit.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.051
For a month.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.290
You ever hear of SmokEnders?

48:33.360 --> 48:34.441
Oh, God, here we go.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.124
DETECTIVE 1: It's a seven-week program.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.725
They wean you off.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.848
You should look into it.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.244
Why am I here, guys?

48:43.320 --> 48:44.731
Why is he here?

48:44.800 --> 48:46.689
- I thought you knew.
- No.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.166
What do you think?

48:49.880 --> 48:52.087
DETECTIVE 1: You got a lawyer, Mr. Finestra?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.525
Do I need one?

48:53.600 --> 48:55.568
Only if you did something.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.608
Did you do something, Mr. Finestra?

48:57.680 --> 48:59.284
Like kill Buck Rogers, maybe?

48:59.800 --> 49:01.040
No.

49:02.240 --> 49:06.245
No, I fucking told you already
that I was with my father.

49:06.520 --> 49:07.760
He told you, too.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.281
- DETECTIVE 1: The movies, right?
- Enter the Dragon.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.522
I loved it myself. He was on the fence.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.171
- It was okay.
- Back to Buck Rogers.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.961
- I want to call my lawyer.
- So, you did do something.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.281
No, you're putting words in my mouth now.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.571
He wants to talk to his lawyer.

49:25.680 --> 49:26.681
Mmm.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.251
The phones still down?

49:28.880 --> 49:30.530
Phones are still down.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.284
So, might take a while.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.887
The Knapp Commission?

49:40.320 --> 49:42.402
It's cops like you guys, right?

49:42.520 --> 49:43.521
(CHUCKLES)

49:44.560 --> 49:48.246
Let me guess, you read The New York Times.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.606
Look, whatever you guys think I did,

49:52.680 --> 49:53.761
I didn't do it.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.123
Well, we think you killed Buck Rogers.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.521
But you're saying that somebody else did.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.246
So, who might that be?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.489
I have no idea.

50:08.720 --> 50:10.529
Who you trying to protect?

50:11.240 --> 50:12.685
Nobody. I just...

50:14.600 --> 50:16.284
I respect that, Richie.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.361
I do.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.206
You're a stand-up guy.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.282
You think Joe Corso
would do the same for you?

50:27.440 --> 50:28.601
What?

50:28.680 --> 50:30.523
You think he'd cover your ass?

50:30.600 --> 50:32.602
I'm just curious.

50:33.640 --> 50:35.961
I don't know, okay?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.523
You know where he is right now? Corso?

50:40.640 --> 50:41.766
I mean, not literally.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.002
Just, for example, while you're sitting in here.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.291
While you're sitting in here,

50:46.600 --> 50:48.489
Joe Corso's out on the town.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.291
It's Friday night.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.563
He's got some whore on his arm,
vodka rocks in his hand.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.608
And he don't give a fuck.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.808
That much I can promise you.

51:16.120 --> 51:18.202
<i>RICHIE: (OVER TAPE) <i>Listen to me,
the only reason I was at Buck's</i></i>

51:18.280 --> 51:19.566
<i>was because you demanded that I be there.</i>

51:19.680 --> 51:22.490

51:26.680 --> 51:27.761

51:29.000 --> 51:30.161
<i>JOE: (OVER TAPE)
Like a fucking enraged animal.</i>

51:30.240 --> 51:31.685
<i>RICHIE: (OVER TAPE) <i>What are you,
out of your mind?</i></i>

51:34.480 --> 51:37.290
We picked up an interesting conversation
between you and your dad, too.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.244
We bugged your office.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.688
You had a painting crew in there recently?

51:52.520 --> 51:55.330
I want my lawyer.
