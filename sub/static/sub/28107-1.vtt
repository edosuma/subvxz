03:31.695 --> 03:33.614
The Prime Minister.

03:36.054 --> 03:39.573
My Lords,
I believe it unnecessary long

03:39.575 --> 03:41.693
to occupy the attention of the House

03:41.695 --> 03:45.533
upon the subject of the motion
which I am about to submit.

03:45.535 --> 03:49.453
I am called upon by His Royal
Highness, the Prince Regent,

03:49.455 --> 03:51.013
to propose a measure

03:51.015 --> 03:53.813
calculated farther
to commemorate the glory

03:53.815 --> 03:55.773
of the Duke of Wellington.

03:55.775 --> 03:56.973
Hear, hear.

03:56.975 --> 04:02.333
After such an heroic action
as that of the 18th of June,

04:02.335 --> 04:04.933
after a victory
which presented a display

04:04.935 --> 04:07.813
of all the great qualities
of a general -

04:07.815 --> 04:10.493
whether for defensive
or offensive warfare,

04:10.495 --> 04:12.893
whether for resistance
or attack,

04:12.895 --> 04:17.012
whether for gallantry,
perseverance, or skill -

04:17.015 --> 04:18.933
I would ask whether,

04:18.935 --> 04:23.213
after a victory
unparalleled in history,

04:23.215 --> 04:26.853
Parliament could be
conceived to do its duty,

04:26.855 --> 04:30.612
if it merely confined itself
to a vote of thanks,

04:30.614 --> 04:34.333
and declined to present
any further evidence

04:34.335 --> 04:37.453
of public gratitude
to the valiant leader

04:37.455 --> 04:39.612
of such a signal victory...

04:39.614 --> 04:43.093
if it refused to make
an adequate provision

04:43.095 --> 04:46.693
for this celebrated conqueror
and his family.

04:48.575 --> 04:51.093
I move a resolution

04:51.095 --> 04:53.652
that this House
grant to His Grace,

04:53.654 --> 04:56.333
the Duke of Wellington,
as farther proof

04:56.335 --> 04:59.173
of the gratitude
of the British nation...

04:59.175 --> 05:03.095
the sum of Â£750,000.

05:04.215 --> 05:06.414
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

05:33.175 --> 05:34.453
General Byng, sir,

05:34.455 --> 05:37.255
Lord Sidmouth
is now at liberty erm...

05:46.614 --> 05:48.815
Oh, beware the step, sir, yes.

05:56.775 --> 05:58.335
Enter.

05:59.335 --> 06:00.733
Er... Er...

06:00.735 --> 06:03.013
G-General Byng, Your Lordship.

06:03.015 --> 06:03.933
Sir John.

06:03.935 --> 06:05.853
- Home Secretary.
- Welcome, sir.

06:05.855 --> 06:07.215
Pray, do be seated.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.815
I thank you.

06:13.935 --> 06:15.495
Let me see...

06:16.255 --> 06:19.855
Yes, your father.
I trust he is in good health?

06:20.975 --> 06:22.535
Sadly not, sir.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.412
Yes. No, please,
do forgive me.

06:25.414 --> 06:29.933
I did so enjoy his company -
despite our differing opinions.

06:29.935 --> 06:32.255
- Splendid fellow.
- Thank you, sir.

06:33.695 --> 06:36.213
It is a great honour
to be in your presence.

06:36.215 --> 06:38.093
The honour is all mine,
Your Lordship.

06:38.095 --> 06:42.213
Your achievements have been
nothing short of... Olympic.

06:42.215 --> 06:44.292
You flatter me, sir.

06:44.294 --> 06:45.612
Enter.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.733
Good morning, Your Lordship.

06:47.735 --> 06:49.453
Good morning, sir.

06:49.455 --> 06:51.093
Would you care for some tea, sir?

06:51.095 --> 06:53.292
- No, thank you, madam.
- Oh.

06:53.294 --> 06:56.093
And how are you feeling today,
Lord Sidmouth?

06:56.095 --> 06:57.693
Much better, thank you,
Mrs Moss.

06:57.695 --> 07:00.373
I'm so very pleased to hear it.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.453
There we are.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.535
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:09.414 --> 07:12.093
I must own, Your Lordship,
that my knowledge of life

07:12.095 --> 07:14.253
is limited
beyond that of a soldier.

07:14.255 --> 07:16.373
And... you'll forgive me
for saying,

07:16.375 --> 07:18.612
but I have little time
for politics.

07:18.614 --> 07:20.693
Excellent, sir.

07:20.695 --> 07:23.612
I have little time
for politics myself.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.054
You, sir, are...

07:29.935 --> 07:32.853
..perfectly qualified,
if I may say so.

07:32.855 --> 07:35.052
Might I ask
how I may be of service?

07:35.054 --> 07:37.412
I would wish to appoint you

07:37.414 --> 07:39.333
Commander of the Northern District.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.253
The Northern District? Not Ireland?

07:42.255 --> 07:44.455
- No, sir, not Ireland.
- I see.

07:45.375 --> 07:49.054
Might you be familiar
with the North of England?

07:49.695 --> 07:50.733
Barely, sir.

07:50.735 --> 07:53.173
My late mother was Yorkshire.

07:53.175 --> 07:55.973
Her family seat
was Wentworth Castle.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.093
Wellington has nothing
but the highest praise

07:59.095 --> 08:00.412
for your achievements.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.052
Thank you, sir.

08:02.054 --> 08:04.853
I had the great privilege
of serving alongside His Grace

08:04.855 --> 08:06.373
on many a campaign.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.973
Yorkshire is indeed
a splendid county.

08:08.975 --> 08:12.614
However, on the other side
of the Pennine Hills...

08:13.654 --> 08:15.893
..in Manchester...

08:15.895 --> 08:18.853
and the surrounding towns
of Lancashire,

08:18.855 --> 08:20.253
there is a sickness.

08:20.255 --> 08:24.333
A dangerous threat
of rampant insurrection.

08:24.335 --> 08:26.013
Indeed, sir.

08:26.015 --> 08:28.013
Enter.

08:28.015 --> 08:29.175
Ah, Hobhouse.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.292
General Sir John Byng,

08:34.294 --> 08:37.332
Mr Hobhouse,
my permanent under-secretary.

08:37.335 --> 08:39.212
It is a great honour
to meet you, Sir John.

08:39.215 --> 08:42.253
Now, Hobhouse,
henceforth Sir John

08:42.255 --> 08:45.373
is to enjoy full access to all files

08:45.375 --> 08:49.652
concerning seditious activity
in the North.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.292
- Excellent.
- Am I to understand

08:51.294 --> 08:53.253
that you wish me
to commence forthwith?

08:53.255 --> 08:55.693
Indeed we do.

08:55.695 --> 08:57.654
- Very well, sir.
- Splendid.

09:17.335 --> 09:19.173
Is this the way to Manchester?

09:19.175 --> 09:20.973
Aye, you're on t'right track,
lad.

09:20.975 --> 09:23.535
- Just keep going.
- Thanking you.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.335
Joseph!

10:19.895 --> 10:22.294
Come on, Son.
Let's sit thee down.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.614
Come on.

10:28.255 --> 10:29.493
Come on.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.495
What's this?

10:32.895 --> 10:35.093
Let's get this off you.

10:35.095 --> 10:37.253
Come on, Son.

10:37.255 --> 10:39.294
There we go. Come on.

10:51.414 --> 10:53.493
Come on, Son.

10:53.495 --> 10:55.614
Come on, get this down you.

10:56.294 --> 10:58.213
Come on, Son.

10:58.215 --> 11:00.775
Hey, now - no skriking.

11:01.815 --> 11:03.975
Come on.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.975
Hey, come on.

11:09.695 --> 11:11.895
Mother's here.

11:13.975 --> 11:15.654
Eh?

11:16.414 --> 11:18.375
Mother's here.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.335
Now, Son.

12:25.535 --> 12:28.213
He were bleeding.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.533
- Right, Aggie?
- All right, Father?

12:30.535 --> 12:32.213
It were streaming down his face.

12:32.215 --> 12:33.652
- Were it?
- Aye.

12:33.654 --> 12:34.893
He deserved it, though.

12:34.895 --> 12:37.052
He's been late three times this week.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.973
Aye, he were bleeding.

12:43.975 --> 12:45.975
A right mess.

12:54.855 --> 12:56.373
He's wiped out.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.093
He gave me
the fright of me life.

12:58.095 --> 13:01.173
- Did he say owt?
- No, not a whistle.

13:01.175 --> 13:03.535
- He's not changed, then!
- Aye.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.853
- Uh-uh!
- Leave it, lad!

13:05.855 --> 13:07.773
- George!
- No, no, no.

13:07.775 --> 13:10.693
Now, let's put that
out of harm's way.

13:10.695 --> 13:12.093
Sit still for a minute.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.493
We'll be going for us
tea soon, lad.

13:14.495 --> 13:15.973
'Ey, we've woken him up now.

13:15.975 --> 13:17.375
Joe?

13:19.054 --> 13:22.693
We're all here.
Come on, let's sit thee up.

13:22.695 --> 13:25.855
- Are you hungry, Joseph?
- I've done you some broth.

13:26.695 --> 13:29.093
- You 'right, Father?
- Aye, lad.

13:29.095 --> 13:31.054
Sit thee down, Father.

13:33.535 --> 13:34.973
Sit down, Son.

13:34.975 --> 13:36.453
- Esther?
- Aye.

13:36.455 --> 13:38.455
Get me a spoon.

13:39.294 --> 13:41.292
Now, mind - it's hot.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.775
Here y'are.

13:44.255 --> 13:47.573
- It's George.
- Aye, he's got big.

13:47.575 --> 13:49.333
Ooh, you can say that again.

13:49.335 --> 13:50.855
He has.

13:52.895 --> 13:54.175
It's a baby.

13:55.054 --> 13:57.493
Aye, little Sarah.

13:57.495 --> 13:58.895
Your niece.

14:01.054 --> 14:03.095
There's your Uncle Joseph.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.693
You 'right?

14:05.695 --> 14:08.054
What were t'fighting like, Joe?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.775
Was you at Waterloo?

14:16.855 --> 14:19.973

14:19.975 --> 14:22.294
Aye, he'll be 'reet.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.095

16:15.895 --> 16:18.175
âª For my song to the poor âª

16:18.614 --> 16:21.614
âª It doth pay some regard âª

16:22.614 --> 16:25.335
âª For trade being dead âª

16:25.775 --> 16:28.855
âª And weaving had a fall âª

16:29.255 --> 16:31.654
âª But I hope in a few months âª

16:32.294 --> 16:34.614

16:48.855 --> 16:51.775
âª Has been eclipsed a main âª

16:52.375 --> 16:54.453

16:57.935 --> 17:01.255

- Half dozen.

17:13.855 --> 17:15.213
- Two.
- Four.

17:15.214 --> 17:17.093
Three.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.654
Best butter pie, Friday.

Smile, Sarah.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.015
- There y'are.

Come on, lass.

17:44.695 --> 17:46.735
No, there's nowt 'ere.

17:47.695 --> 17:49.695
Sorry, lad.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.255
Any work?

18:27.575 --> 18:29.893

18:29.895 --> 18:31.493
But there were nowt going.

18:31.495 --> 18:33.093
There is nowt going.

18:33.095 --> 18:35.735
There's talk of them
cutting wages again next month.

18:36.455 --> 18:39.493
- Cutting them to what?
- To the bone, Mother.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.853
Aye, and that bread tax
is helping no one.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.373
- It's helping someone.
- Who?

18:43.375 --> 18:45.813
- Them rich beggars.
- Bastard farmers.

18:45.815 --> 18:47.533
It's not just t'farmers' fault,
Robert.

18:47.535 --> 18:49.813
- How d'you mean?
- It's t'government, Mary.

18:49.815 --> 18:51.292
Government?

18:51.294 --> 18:54.213
Landowners have got
t'government in their pockets.

18:54.215 --> 18:57.573
Besides, most of t'government
are landowners themselves!

18:57.575 --> 19:00.412
Getting fat on land that they
stole from us in t'first place.

19:00.414 --> 19:01.493
Oh, aye.

19:01.495 --> 19:03.253
What's that to do
with t'price of bread?

19:03.255 --> 19:06.693
They have a bad harvest,
there's a shortage of corn.

19:06.695 --> 19:08.292
They won't let them import any

19:08.294 --> 19:10.453
from France or America
or anywhere,

19:10.455 --> 19:12.573
so they force prices up
and us poor souls

19:12.575 --> 19:15.412
end up paying five times more
for a loaf of bread.

19:15.414 --> 19:17.573
- Is that t'Corn Laws?
- It is.

19:17.575 --> 19:20.213
They were meant to help us
but it just made things worse.

19:20.215 --> 19:22.652
When has a government
ever done anything to help us?

19:22.654 --> 19:24.373
True.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.493
Fat leeches, down London.

19:26.495 --> 19:28.614
They'll starve us all to death.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.612
Elevenpence ha'penny.

19:35.614 --> 19:37.335
You take that, Esther.

19:38.735 --> 19:40.455
We'll get by on t'rest.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.815
No!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.773
âª The house-rent and fire âª

19:49.775 --> 19:52.335
âª It does take half that we get âª

19:53.654 --> 19:55.895
âª And the others but a trifle âª

19:56.775 --> 19:58.975
âª To supply us with meat âª

20:00.695 --> 20:03.054
âª Betwixt hunger and cold âª

20:03.895 --> 20:07.054
âª Our jaws they look so thin âª

20:08.455 --> 20:11.414
âª We shall be in rare condition âª

20:12.575 --> 20:14.695
âª For tobacco to grin âª

20:16.775 --> 20:19.373
Margaret Micklethwaite,

20:19.375 --> 20:21.533
as for the misdemeanour
of loose,

20:21.535 --> 20:23.373
idle and disorderly conduct,

20:23.375 --> 20:25.493
given the intoxicated
and indecorous state

20:25.495 --> 20:27.855
in which you were discovered
in your mistress's cellar,

20:28.414 --> 20:31.052
there can be little doubt
that you were, and remain,

20:31.054 --> 20:34.213
decidedly loose,
unquestionably idle

20:34.215 --> 20:37.294
and resolutely disorderly.

20:37.895 --> 20:40.414
Now, as for the felony,

20:40.975 --> 20:44.573
to whit, the theft of two
bottles of excellent claret,

20:44.575 --> 20:46.412
before I pass sentence,

20:46.414 --> 20:49.612
indulge my curiosity,
Mrs Micklethwaite,

20:49.614 --> 20:52.333
and inform me,
what erroneous pretext

20:52.335 --> 20:55.614
compelled you to descend into
the cellar in the first place.

20:56.614 --> 20:58.773
I were up in th'attic

20:58.775 --> 21:02.535
and I saw this ghost,
looking at me.

21:03.335 --> 21:06.013
And I 'ad to run
down to t'cellar - honest!

21:07.855 --> 21:09.335
Indeed!

21:10.695 --> 21:15.855
So, afeared of the spirit
in the attic,

21:16.614 --> 21:19.855
you partook of the spirit
in the cellar.

21:25.255 --> 21:26.733
Oh...

21:26.735 --> 21:30.253
Given the dual nature of your crime,

21:30.255 --> 21:32.533
I am minded to pass this case upward

21:32.535 --> 21:33.933
to the Quarter Sessions,

21:33.935 --> 21:36.853
with the recommendation that
you spend the next seven years

21:36.855 --> 21:38.412
contemplating your sins

21:38.414 --> 21:41.052
overlooking the exotic vista
of Botany Bay.

21:41.054 --> 21:43.933
No, sir! No! I've got a lad
at home what needs me!

21:43.935 --> 21:45.015
Silence!

21:46.815 --> 21:48.693
I am reluctant
to impose upon the Crown

21:48.695 --> 21:51.215
the cost of your transportation.

21:52.255 --> 21:53.933
Therefore, you shall be whipped...

21:53.935 --> 21:54.853
No, sir, no! Please, sir!

21:54.855 --> 21:57.412
..that it may shame you
and deter others.

21:57.414 --> 22:00.453
You may then spend
the next 14 days in gaol,

22:00.455 --> 22:04.253
in quiet contemplation
of your crimes.

22:04.255 --> 22:05.533
Take her down.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.333
Edward Wild.

22:07.335 --> 22:10.412
For what purpose were you
in the vicinity of Tib Street,

22:10.414 --> 22:13.773
Manchester, on the third day
of November last?

22:13.775 --> 22:15.493
We was knocking down a wall.

22:15.495 --> 22:17.775
- Why? What are you?
- A labourer.

22:18.335 --> 22:20.333
Oh. Were you in liquor?

22:20.335 --> 22:22.373
No, sir.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.213
Then perhaps you might
explain to me

22:24.215 --> 22:27.493
what occasioned you
to enter a haberdasher's shop

22:27.495 --> 22:30.292
- on the day in question.
- It's my pocket watch, sir.

22:30.294 --> 22:32.693
It is not your pocket watch.

22:32.695 --> 22:37.292
It is a silver pocket watch,
valued at five guineas.

22:37.294 --> 22:41.493
It is the property of
the haberdasher, Mr Arnold.

22:41.495 --> 22:46.173
Furthermore, his name
is quite clearly inscribed

22:46.175 --> 22:49.493
upon the reverse side
of the case back.

22:49.495 --> 22:51.213
I won it on a game of dice.

22:51.215 --> 22:53.292
- Where?
- The Old Boar's Head.

22:53.294 --> 22:54.255
When?

22:56.015 --> 22:58.095
I can't remember, s-sir.

22:58.735 --> 23:01.335
You are wasting
the time of this court.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.453
I am to recommend
that you be transported

23:05.455 --> 23:09.215
to the territory of Australia
for a period of 14 years.

23:10.815 --> 23:15.052
Our Lord God owns
everything upon this earth,

23:15.054 --> 23:19.493
and when you steal,
you rob from him.

23:19.495 --> 23:22.173
- You are James Mahon?
- Yes.

23:22.175 --> 23:23.933
Remove your hat.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.775
- Wha'?
- You are in a court of law.

23:29.695 --> 23:32.292
You are charged with stealing
a coat from your master.

23:32.294 --> 23:34.815
No. No, I didn't steal it.
I took it.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.773
Explain to me the difference.

23:37.775 --> 23:39.652
He had two, I needed one.

23:39.654 --> 23:41.414
He's got one. I've got one.
I was cold.

23:42.015 --> 23:44.253
- Are you an Englishman?
- Yes, sir.

23:44.255 --> 23:46.294
Do you know your Bible?

23:47.375 --> 23:49.175
Can you read?

23:51.015 --> 23:53.215
"Thou shalt not steal."

23:53.855 --> 23:55.695
God's Commandment,
number eight.

23:58.654 --> 23:59.933
I'm a reformer.

23:59.935 --> 24:01.893
- A reformer?
- Yes.

24:01.895 --> 24:03.573
That gives you
the right to steal?

24:03.575 --> 24:05.412
No, it's not stealing.
It's sharing.

24:05.414 --> 24:07.535
What's mine is yours
and what's yours is mine.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.614
- Is that the coat?
- Yes.

24:12.255 --> 24:14.015
Take it off.

24:16.575 --> 24:18.495
Remove that coat.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.895
Have it.

24:26.414 --> 24:28.573
I shall commit you
to the Quarter Sessions.

24:28.575 --> 24:30.975
I shall recommend that you
be hanged. Take him down.

24:32.015 --> 24:33.495
Hanged?

24:34.495 --> 24:36.495
Over a coat?

24:58.935 --> 25:00.935
Find out where he lives.

25:08.414 --> 25:10.773
It is our profound belief

25:10.775 --> 25:14.573
that we are on the brink
of the dawn of liberty.

25:15.495 --> 25:18.013
We are on the verge of achieving

25:18.015 --> 25:20.693
elevation from the cesspits and swamps

25:20.695 --> 25:22.693
in which our government
would have us dwell.

25:23.895 --> 25:26.095
We shan't be denied any longer.

25:26.815 --> 25:29.973
The government's defences
are creaking.

25:29.975 --> 25:31.533
The water is rising.

25:31.535 --> 25:33.013
The dam is breaking.

25:33.015 --> 25:37.414
The foam it swells,
it swells all around them.

25:38.215 --> 25:40.652
The gilded reptiles
are unable to overawe

25:40.654 --> 25:44.493
this expression of public opinion.

25:44.495 --> 25:48.652
These apish Jupiters...

25:48.654 --> 25:49.773
Hear, hear!

25:49.775 --> 25:54.652
..the phantasmagoria
of prophets who sit fat and idle

25:54.654 --> 25:58.013
in that infernal monster pit
they call Parliament,

25:58.015 --> 25:59.853
are quaking in their boots.

25:59.855 --> 26:01.093
Aye!

26:01.095 --> 26:04.733
Let the friends of
radical reform but persevere.

26:04.735 --> 26:08.853
Let us be firm and fear not
that victory will be ours.

26:08.855 --> 26:11.213
Our enemies will shrink

26:11.215 --> 26:13.973
before the voice of all powerful truth.

26:13.975 --> 26:18.013
When the pimps of authority
deny a man suffrage,

26:18.015 --> 26:21.412
they rob him
of all security for his life,

26:21.414 --> 26:24.093
liberty and property.

26:24.095 --> 26:27.893
What kind of people are they
to commit such atrocities?

26:27.895 --> 26:32.733
Friends, I urge you one and all
to go home to your families

26:32.735 --> 26:36.652
and tell them to join us,
hand and heart.

26:36.654 --> 26:40.652
Tell them: courage is
a kind of salvation.

26:40.654 --> 26:43.733
Tell them:
we have it in our power

26:43.735 --> 26:46.493
to begin the world
over again.

26:46.495 --> 26:48.493
Aye!

26:48.495 --> 26:51.414
Every citizen
must answer the call.

26:52.495 --> 26:54.853
For we can easily forgive a child

26:54.855 --> 26:56.855
who is afraid of the dark.

26:57.775 --> 26:59.493
The real tragedy of life

26:59.495 --> 27:02.493
is when men are
afraid of the light.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.654
Aye, well said, John.

27:05.414 --> 27:07.493
Well said, John Saxton!
Hear, hear.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.455
- Into the light!
- Yes.

27:16.815 --> 27:20.733
Gentlemen... I have
long and deeply...

27:20.735 --> 27:22.975
felt for the labouring class.

27:23.735 --> 27:25.453
And it is this feeling alone

27:25.455 --> 27:29.693
which induces me to promote
constitutional reformation

27:29.695 --> 27:32.213
of the representation
of the people

27:32.215 --> 27:33.733
in the House of Commons.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.933
- Aye.
- Hear, hear.

27:34.935 --> 27:39.533
For believe me when I say
that the distress of the people

27:39.535 --> 27:43.093
is too great to be removed
by any power

27:43.095 --> 27:45.253
other than that of Parliament.

27:45.255 --> 27:47.294
- Aye!
- True!

27:48.495 --> 27:52.973
The object of Parliament
ought to be the general good,

27:52.975 --> 27:54.773
the equal protection,

27:54.775 --> 27:58.412
the security of the person and
property of each individual.

27:58.414 --> 27:59.493
- Yes.
- That is right.

27:59.495 --> 28:04.253
Therefore labour,
the poor man's only property,

28:04.255 --> 28:06.973
ought to be as sacred
as any other property.

28:06.975 --> 28:08.775
Aye!

28:09.495 --> 28:12.573
I deem it proper to inform you,
that a few weeks ago,

28:12.575 --> 28:15.453
the few gentlemen
from Manchester,

28:15.455 --> 28:18.693
who have, luckily for us,
better understandings

28:18.695 --> 28:21.373
and a superior degree
of human feeling,

28:21.375 --> 28:25.213
presented a requisition to the
borough reeve and constables,

28:25.215 --> 28:27.652
requesting them
to call an open meeting

28:27.654 --> 28:30.773
to consider petitioning
the House of Commons

28:30.775 --> 28:32.652
to repeal all the laws

28:32.654 --> 28:36.412
which restrain the importation
of corn or grain.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.973
- Aye! Hear, hear.
- With this requisition,

28:38.975 --> 28:40.652
the borough reeve
and constables

28:40.654 --> 28:42.253
refused to comply...

28:42.255 --> 28:45.412
- Shame!
- Bastards!

28:45.414 --> 28:46.652
- Shameful.
- Bastards!

28:46.654 --> 28:48.493
Nor is this all, gentlemen.

28:48.495 --> 28:51.052
If any individual
has at any time

28:51.054 --> 28:52.612
attempted to represent

28:52.614 --> 28:54.973
to the inhabitants of
our town and neighbourhood,

28:54.975 --> 28:58.893
the enormous burthens imposed
upon them by the government,

28:58.895 --> 29:02.373
or taken any steps to
prevent the imposition of new,

29:02.375 --> 29:04.735
or to remove any old burthens,

29:05.495 --> 29:09.493
they have uniformly vilified
and calumniated them

29:09.495 --> 29:11.573
in the most scandalous
and shameful degree.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.693
Aye.

29:12.695 --> 29:15.893
And, not content with this,
they have, as is well known,

29:15.895 --> 29:18.373
caused great numbers
to be thrown into prison...

29:18.375 --> 29:20.612
- That is right.
- ..and there endure

29:20.614 --> 29:22.652
every species of suffering

29:22.654 --> 29:25.533
their malignity
could procure them.

29:25.535 --> 29:28.933
I, myself, gentlemen, have had
the distinguished honour

29:28.935 --> 29:33.213
of being twice the object
of their malignant vengeance,

29:33.215 --> 29:36.693
and enjoyed the indignity
of a dungeon cell.

29:36.695 --> 29:38.013
'Tis true!

29:38.015 --> 29:40.853
When the recent war was over,

29:40.855 --> 29:45.893
and the people expected plenty
to have returned with peace,

29:45.895 --> 29:48.893
their distress
became worse than ever,

29:48.895 --> 29:52.333
and it is the opinion
of most thinking men that,

29:52.335 --> 29:54.213
at that juncture, the populace

29:54.215 --> 29:55.853
would then
have fallen in violence

29:55.855 --> 30:01.973
upon their employers or their
dealers in goods, or both,

30:01.975 --> 30:03.853
but for the views exhibited

30:03.855 --> 30:06.013
by the advocates
of parliamentary reform.

30:06.015 --> 30:07.614
- 'Tis true.
- Aye.

30:09.535 --> 30:12.573
The constitution of our country

30:12.575 --> 30:17.493
vests the right of electing
members of the House of Commons

30:17.495 --> 30:19.412
in the people.

30:19.414 --> 30:23.733
Therefore, we must, openly,
and in a manner

30:23.735 --> 30:27.213
and with language that is
mild and constitutional,

30:27.215 --> 30:31.735
yet firm and clear...
call for these reforms.

30:32.735 --> 30:35.453
The division of the population
of the United Kingdom

30:35.455 --> 30:37.773
- into equal parts.
- Aye!

30:37.775 --> 30:40.453
Those parts to equal
the number of representatives.

30:40.455 --> 30:41.733
Aye!

30:41.735 --> 30:43.773
Each representative
to be an inhabitant

30:43.775 --> 30:45.412
of the district he represents.

30:45.414 --> 30:46.813
Aye!

30:46.815 --> 30:50.733
Each man to be entitled
to vote for his representative.

30:50.735 --> 30:52.333
- Aye.
- Hear, hear.

30:52.335 --> 30:55.333
And Parliament
to be elected annually.

30:55.335 --> 30:57.015
- Aye!
- Hear, hear!

30:59.614 --> 31:01.453
Dr Joseph Healey,

31:01.455 --> 31:03.893
representing
Oldham, Lancashire,

31:03.895 --> 31:06.052
heartily concurs!

31:06.054 --> 31:08.095
I thank you, Mr Healey.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.495
Samuel Bamford,
township of Middleton.

31:12.095 --> 31:14.693
I would like to speak
in support of my friend,

31:14.695 --> 31:17.052
- Mr Knight.
- Thank you, Mr Bamford.

31:17.054 --> 31:19.213
We have seen with our own eyes

31:19.215 --> 31:22.373
the likes of these
borough reeves and constables,

31:22.375 --> 31:26.373
who supposedly are there
to protect our interests

31:26.375 --> 31:27.853
and to keep t'peace

31:27.855 --> 31:32.253
but in truth they turn a blind
eye to t'transgressions

31:32.255 --> 31:34.373
and iniquities that blight
all our lives.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.533
True, Sam. True.

31:35.535 --> 31:38.652
All the while
feathering their own nests

31:38.654 --> 31:40.614
and hindering
the common man.

31:41.575 --> 31:44.292
And what is
our national Parliament

31:44.294 --> 31:47.292
but t'same affliction
on a grander scale?

31:47.294 --> 31:49.213
Aye.

31:49.215 --> 31:52.733
The sooner
we can represent ourselves

31:52.735 --> 31:57.213
in all matters of local
and national interest,

31:57.215 --> 32:01.412
the sooner we can return
to our work with dignity!

32:01.414 --> 32:03.813
Aye!

32:03.815 --> 32:06.412
We must expose the corrupters,

32:06.414 --> 32:09.853
shine a light on their
treachery once and for all.

32:09.855 --> 32:12.612
- Aye!
- Aye, John, aye. Hear, hear!

32:12.614 --> 32:14.813
Hear, hear, John!

32:14.815 --> 32:16.975
Hear, hear!

32:25.414 --> 32:28.213
- You all right, love?
- Oh, aye.

32:28.215 --> 32:30.013
So...

32:30.015 --> 32:33.493
what's to be done
to save the world, eh?

32:33.495 --> 32:35.173
They said we have to be ready.

32:35.175 --> 32:37.052
- What for?
- For things to change.

32:37.054 --> 32:38.253
How d'you mean?

32:38.255 --> 32:39.933
That's what they said,
didn't they?

32:39.935 --> 32:42.533
Aye, Father. They said
we have to spread the word.

32:42.535 --> 32:44.373
But what did they talk about?

32:44.375 --> 32:47.893
About having a voice.
Er... representation.

32:47.895 --> 32:49.693
Hmm. Talk, talk, talk.

32:49.695 --> 32:52.333
- No, no, he means the vote.
- We know he means the vote

32:52.335 --> 32:54.292
but what's to be done
to get the vote?

32:54.294 --> 32:56.253
What's to be done
is what they was doing...

32:56.255 --> 32:57.453
Shh...

32:57.455 --> 32:58.933
..what they was doing tonight.

32:58.935 --> 33:02.493
People meeting, talking,
being strong together.

33:02.495 --> 33:05.173
All right, keep your hair on.
I were just saying.

33:05.175 --> 33:06.893
Less talk, more action.

33:06.895 --> 33:09.652
Come on, George.
Come on, wake up.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.853
Any road,
they'll never give us t'vote.

33:12.855 --> 33:15.253
They'll give us nowt by
that way of thinking, Nellie.

33:15.255 --> 33:17.813
These folk think
we stand a chance, Mam.

33:17.815 --> 33:20.095
- And who are these folk?
- From all over.

33:21.335 --> 33:23.493
- Working men?
- Oh, aye.

33:23.495 --> 33:25.695
- I'll go and see how she is.
- Come on, lad.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.775
Good night, George.

33:33.855 --> 33:36.095
- See thee tomorrow.
- Good night, love.

34:00.255 --> 34:04.373
The men, women and children
who keep

34:04.375 --> 34:08.733
the relentless grinding
of the wheels of industry

34:08.735 --> 34:10.013
turning and spinning,

34:10.014 --> 34:12.612
whilst working every hour
that is asked of them

34:12.614 --> 34:14.335
are being left destitute.

34:17.455 --> 34:20.373
With barely the energy
to stand on two feet.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.612
Aye.

34:22.614 --> 34:24.293
The annals of history,

34:25.054 --> 34:28.493
they show us what a despot
was King James II.

34:28.495 --> 34:30.292
Aye.

34:30.293 --> 34:33.693
Yet our forefathers were able
to affirm their liberties

34:33.695 --> 34:36.172
without the loss
of a single life.

34:43.054 --> 34:45.292
Now, why was this?

34:45.293 --> 34:48.733
This was because the people
were unanimous

34:48.735 --> 34:51.533
and determined
to put down tyrannism.

34:51.534 --> 34:53.333
- Aye!
- Hear, hear!

34:53.335 --> 34:55.215
Hear, hear!

34:55.895 --> 34:59.815
They secured
the Bill of Rights of 1689.

35:03.335 --> 35:07.255
That Bill of Rights ensured
Parliament remains sovereign.

35:08.095 --> 35:09.973
But what good is a parliament

35:09.975 --> 35:12.253
if it does not represent
its people?

35:12.255 --> 35:14.215
Hear, hear!

35:16.855 --> 35:20.973
What right does a king have
to a payout from the government

35:20.975 --> 35:22.773
of Â£2 million per annum?

35:22.775 --> 35:24.253
No right!

35:24.255 --> 35:27.693
A king who has lost his senses,
if he ever had any.

35:27.695 --> 35:31.093
And what right does our good,
gracious, illustrious -

35:31.095 --> 35:32.813
or should I say, big fat -

35:32.815 --> 35:35.093
Prince have
with one-and-a-half million?

35:35.095 --> 35:36.573
He has no right!

35:36.575 --> 35:38.693
What right do these men have
with this money,

35:38.695 --> 35:41.453
when those they have robbed
are starving for want?

35:41.455 --> 35:43.412
They have no right.
No right at all!

35:43.414 --> 35:45.253
No, sir.
They do not have that right.

35:45.255 --> 35:46.453
No!

35:46.455 --> 35:47.933
- But we have a right.
- Aye!

35:47.935 --> 35:51.213
We have a right
to present a petition

35:51.215 --> 35:53.933
to this big, fat prince.

35:53.935 --> 35:55.373
And that we propose to do.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.612
Hear, hear.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.652
This petition
will demand at last

36:00.654 --> 36:03.493
a fair, proper
and full representation

36:03.495 --> 36:05.573
- for all Englishmen.
- Aye.

36:07.935 --> 36:13.093
If... If, after forty days
and forty nights

36:13.095 --> 36:17.253
there is no response
from our... beloved Prince...

36:18.335 --> 36:21.213
..we shall take said petition
to the King.

36:21.215 --> 36:24.453
And... if he ignores us,

36:24.455 --> 36:26.773
we have the right,
as Englishmen,

36:26.775 --> 36:28.973
to imprison him
and all his family.

36:32.175 --> 36:37.054
All we demand
is that our voices are heard...

36:38.175 --> 36:40.652
..and that
our sufferings cease.

36:40.654 --> 36:43.973
We are on the verge
of a devastating cataclysm!

36:43.975 --> 36:47.652
The time has come to alleviate
the sufferings of the people.

36:47.654 --> 36:49.733
I call forth a deluge

36:49.735 --> 36:52.773
to cleanse this land
of its festering corruption.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.612
Almighty Father,
permit us to be the Noahs,

36:55.614 --> 36:59.652
the Deucalions and the Pyrrhas
as we start this world anew.

36:59.654 --> 37:00.975
Mr Knight!

37:09.935 --> 37:13.213
Friends, I should like
to invite Mr John Knight

37:13.215 --> 37:14.294
to now speak.

37:15.375 --> 37:17.335
Mr Knight.

37:20.175 --> 37:23.013
Gentlemen, I should like to
thank Mr Bagguley,

37:23.015 --> 37:25.533
Mr Drummond and Mr Johnston

37:25.535 --> 37:27.695
for their impassioned rhetoric.

37:30.975 --> 37:35.453
Although I cannot
concur with the notion

37:35.455 --> 37:37.612
that the imprisonment of the King

37:37.614 --> 37:39.575
would advance the cause.

37:57.414 --> 38:00.813
Nevertheless, I congratulate them

38:00.815 --> 38:04.813
on their considerable fervour
and their zeal.

38:14.575 --> 38:16.612
I thank you, gentlemen.

38:16.614 --> 38:18.373
Thank you, Mr Knight.

38:18.375 --> 38:20.095
Thank you, Mr Knight.

38:38.614 --> 38:41.213
- They're going to London.
- What, Bagguley and that?

38:41.215 --> 38:43.173
They're going to see
the Prince.

38:43.175 --> 38:44.173
- What?
- They're not!

38:44.175 --> 38:46.853
- They are, Mam.
- The Prince Regent, it is.

38:46.855 --> 38:48.493
Oh, aye.

38:48.495 --> 38:51.573
They're taking him this er...
What is it, Father?

38:51.575 --> 38:53.373
- Petition.
- Aye, a petition.

38:53.375 --> 38:56.013
- What will it say, Father?
- It's a list of demands.

38:56.015 --> 38:57.612
- Oh, aye.
- Our rights.

38:57.614 --> 38:59.652
Hallelujah!

38:59.654 --> 39:02.412
Prince... thingummy
isn't going to give ha'porth

39:02.414 --> 39:05.052
for a scrap of paper that's
come all t'way from Lancashire.

39:05.054 --> 39:06.893
If he dun't,
they'll take it to the King.

39:06.895 --> 39:10.013
And then what?
He's as mad as a March hare!

39:10.015 --> 39:11.773
They said if he won't do owt,
they'll lock him up.

39:11.775 --> 39:14.933
- What, the King?
- Aye, the King and his family.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.253
Who's going to lock up
the King? Them three lads?

39:17.255 --> 39:18.614
No, the people will.

39:19.255 --> 39:21.453
And how's the people
going to do that?

39:21.455 --> 39:23.533
That's just plain daft.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.253
At least they're
doing something.

39:25.255 --> 39:27.773
They're not doing owt.
It's just more talk.

39:27.775 --> 39:29.813
I'll tell you what they're
not doing, Nellie,

39:29.815 --> 39:33.173
they're not sitting
on their backsides, waiting.

39:33.175 --> 39:35.013
I know, I know.

39:35.015 --> 39:36.813
I don't blame you
for losing hope, Mam.

39:36.815 --> 39:38.933
I haven't lost hope, son.

39:38.935 --> 39:42.173
I'll never lose hope.
Times is too hard to lose hope.

39:42.175 --> 39:43.495
Hope's all we've got.

39:44.614 --> 39:46.495
But you've got to start small.

39:47.375 --> 39:50.412
As they say,
from little acorns...

39:50.414 --> 39:52.535
mighty oak trees grow.

40:12.495 --> 40:14.173
They must be removed forthwith.

40:14.175 --> 40:16.253
- I concur.
- Hear, hear.

40:16.255 --> 40:17.893
They're polluting our streets.

40:17.895 --> 40:21.493
Indeed. We must pluck
the braying bellwethers

40:21.495 --> 40:24.333
from their schismatic pulpits,

40:24.335 --> 40:28.015
but we cannot incarcerate
their entire Godless flock.

40:28.855 --> 40:30.973
Three thousand fools

40:30.975 --> 40:33.733
stuffed into the New Bailey
like anchovies in a pot?

40:33.735 --> 40:38.093
No, gentlemen. The rabble
must be awed into submission.

40:38.095 --> 40:40.292
A mere show of military might

40:40.294 --> 40:42.933
would soon see them
gambolling like little lambs

40:42.935 --> 40:44.292
back to their looms.

40:44.294 --> 40:46.412
They are ignorant souls.

40:46.414 --> 40:48.093
They know not what they want.

40:48.095 --> 40:50.253
- They are children.
- Innocent babes.

40:50.255 --> 40:52.093
Babes, perhaps.
Innocent? Never.

40:52.095 --> 40:54.173
The rod is all they understand.

40:54.175 --> 40:57.933
"My son, fear thou
the Lord and the King,

40:57.935 --> 41:00.493
and meddle not with them
that are given to change."

41:00.495 --> 41:03.255
Gentlemen, might I urge
a little forbearance?

41:05.975 --> 41:09.255
The labouring classes
are ruled by their stomachs.

41:10.654 --> 41:13.052
Were we to
prevail upon the mill owners

41:13.054 --> 41:16.213
to furnish them with an
additional shilling per week...

41:16.215 --> 41:17.773
their hunger
would be alleviated

41:17.775 --> 41:20.493
and this agitation would cease.

41:20.495 --> 41:23.253
A shilling this week,
two shillings next week,

41:23.255 --> 41:25.173
a guinea for Christmas.

41:25.175 --> 41:27.253
This concerns not money.

41:27.255 --> 41:31.173
This concerns not
an extension of the franchise.

41:31.175 --> 41:34.414
This concerns
neither liberty nor freedom.

41:35.095 --> 41:39.855
The remedy, gentlemen,
is the iron hand of the law.

41:41.015 --> 41:43.173
So we're all agreed. Grand!

41:43.175 --> 41:47.815
Gentlemen, is this not...
a passing season...

41:48.495 --> 41:52.173
..of hot-headed intemperance,
which will run its course?

41:52.175 --> 41:54.575
No. It is not.

41:56.015 --> 41:58.412
Will you not join us at table,
Nadin?

41:58.414 --> 42:01.052
These are dangerous men.

42:01.054 --> 42:02.173
They're a threat.

42:02.175 --> 42:05.173
We need some pretext
to arrest them.

42:05.175 --> 42:08.213
Indeed.
But the question is this:

42:08.215 --> 42:12.253
do we have evidence that
they are inciting these people

42:12.255 --> 42:14.173
to armed insurrection?

42:14.175 --> 42:16.375
Well, we do not know
that they are armed.

42:17.495 --> 42:19.533
Are they armed, Colonel?

42:19.535 --> 42:21.373
Chippendale?

42:21.375 --> 42:24.853
Gentlemen, I have witnessed
no evidence of arms.

42:24.855 --> 42:28.375
You have witnessed no evidence
of arms, Chippendale.

42:29.294 --> 42:32.695
But that does not mean
that they do not bear arms.

42:37.095 --> 42:39.575
- In my opinion...
- Your opinion?

42:40.175 --> 42:42.495
Your opinion is not important.

42:43.575 --> 42:45.652
You're an informant.

42:45.654 --> 42:49.052
Inform... or sit down.

42:49.054 --> 42:53.893
I might remind you,
Deputy Chief Constable Nadin,

42:53.895 --> 42:56.775
that this man is in my employ.

42:58.414 --> 43:00.893
Colonel Fletcher, sir.

43:00.895 --> 43:03.253
Gentlemen,

43:03.255 --> 43:06.052
we cannot act
without evidence.

43:06.054 --> 43:08.215
There's always evidence.

43:09.575 --> 43:12.893
You've just got to know
where to look for it.

43:12.895 --> 43:15.855
And if you don't find it,
you crack a few heads.

43:32.215 --> 43:35.813
When might you next
visit Manchester, William?

43:35.815 --> 43:38.292
Wednesday. Early.

43:38.294 --> 43:40.375
I've to be in court.

43:41.215 --> 43:43.612
I thought
I might travel with you.

43:43.614 --> 43:45.813
If you must.

43:45.815 --> 43:48.453
I should like to visit
Arabella.

43:48.455 --> 43:50.652
She has the palsy.

43:50.654 --> 43:52.612
Has she, now?

43:52.614 --> 43:54.054
Listen to this.

43:55.695 --> 43:57.652
"In all my twenty years
as a magistrate

43:57.654 --> 44:00.373
charged with the keeping
of the peace,

44:00.375 --> 44:03.173
never have I been witness
to the scale and size

44:03.175 --> 44:05.333
of these people's ambition.

44:05.335 --> 44:08.693
The trouble brewing here has
a much more frightening purpose

44:08.695 --> 44:11.933
than that of winning the vote
for the working man.

44:11.935 --> 44:14.173
What we are witnessing
on the ground

44:14.175 --> 44:17.813
is a vast number of people
ripe for insurrection.

44:17.815 --> 44:19.933
They will never
give up their course

44:19.935 --> 44:22.975
until they have established
a republican court."

44:24.935 --> 44:26.335
Oh, dear!

44:27.335 --> 44:32.175
"I am sorry...
to have to... inform you..."

44:33.975 --> 44:37.333
"These are
the most violent preachings

44:37.335 --> 44:39.333
of disaffected demagogues,

44:39.335 --> 44:41.493
who seek to strike
the flint of reform

44:41.495 --> 44:43.933
against the steel of greed -

44:43.935 --> 44:46.173
the greed of a labouring class

44:46.175 --> 44:49.975
ever seeking a shilling's more
wage for an hour's less toil.

44:50.614 --> 44:53.173
The resulting spark
must soon take hold,

44:53.175 --> 44:56.453
threatening the very safety
of our neighbourhoods.

44:56.455 --> 44:57.612
Such gatherings,

44:57.614 --> 45:01.052
and many more hewn from
the same seditious block,

45:01.054 --> 45:03.933
no longer bring together
a few dozen malcontents

45:03.935 --> 45:05.453
and ne'er-do-wells

45:05.455 --> 45:08.253
to pass secret codes
and hidden messages

45:08.255 --> 45:10.933
at the back of Methodist
Sunday school rooms,

45:10.935 --> 45:13.933
or above squalid low taverns.

45:13.935 --> 45:18.253
These meetings, now held
brazenly and in plain sight,

45:18.255 --> 45:20.853
are attended in numbers
in many instances

45:20.855 --> 45:24.213
exceeding three,
four, five thousand.

45:24.215 --> 45:27.093
And there the rallying cry
of Bagguley

45:27.095 --> 45:29.773
and his scurrilous brethren

45:29.775 --> 45:34.213
are hallooed by
the ill-educated, ungodly mob

45:34.215 --> 45:38.654
as they incite them
in violent and in bloody terms.

45:39.935 --> 45:45.935
They speak not of reform...
but of destruction.

45:48.775 --> 45:52.533
Oh, I humbly beseech
Your Lordship

45:52.535 --> 45:54.853
to do all within your power

45:54.855 --> 46:00.973
to bring forth
a great deluge from above,

46:00.975 --> 46:06.213
that this may extinguish
once and for all

46:06.215 --> 46:11.373
this most ferocious
and bloody threat

46:11.375 --> 46:16.335
to the peace and harmony
of our... great land..."

46:17.895 --> 46:20.052
No...

46:20.054 --> 46:24.414
"..of our... sweet land.

46:25.335 --> 46:27.973
I remain, as always, your most
humble and obedient servant,

46:27.975 --> 46:33.455
Reverend...
Charles Wicksted Ethelston."

46:35.175 --> 46:36.775
Poetry!

47:30.614 --> 47:32.414
Morning, Mr Rook.

47:38.175 --> 47:40.693
Mr Grout, sir.
Lord Sidmouth and Mr Hobhouse.

47:40.695 --> 47:42.695
Thank you, Mr Cobb.

47:54.255 --> 47:56.815
Mm. Mr Golightly?

48:03.414 --> 48:06.294
The Reverend Ethelston.

48:06.775 --> 48:10.093
"The rallying cry of Bagguley
and his scurrilous brethren

48:10.095 --> 48:12.093
- are hallooed by..."
- Hallooed!

48:12.095 --> 48:14.573
- Hallooed!
- Hallooed!

48:14.575 --> 48:17.052
"..by the ill-educated,
ungodly mob

48:17.054 --> 48:21.533
as they incite them in
violent and in bloody terms."

48:21.535 --> 48:23.813
Heaven defend his congregation,
Mr Grout.

48:23.815 --> 48:25.414
Indeed, Mr Golightly.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.292
Ethelston.

48:48.294 --> 48:50.612
"Bring forth a deluge
from above..."

48:50.614 --> 48:52.373
The bard of Manchester.

48:52.375 --> 48:54.773
Five thousand
at Bagguley's meeting!

48:54.775 --> 48:58.093
Bagguley?
I believe the time has come

48:58.095 --> 49:00.773
to remove the head
of this particular serpent.

49:00.775 --> 49:02.652
- How old is he?
- Nineteen.

49:02.654 --> 49:05.573
- Sunday school scholars.
- Indeed.

49:05.575 --> 49:07.453
We have given this young man
enough rope

49:07.455 --> 49:10.493
with which to hang himself.
I suggest we tighten the knot.

49:10.495 --> 49:13.733
This plague ever spreads
throughout the land.

49:13.735 --> 49:16.213
We must be brutal,
with a cautious hand.

49:16.215 --> 49:18.255
Indeed we must.

49:19.054 --> 49:23.695
Another magisterial missive
from Manchester.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.255
Hmm.

49:26.815 --> 49:31.213
Gentlemen, may I first avow,

49:31.215 --> 49:33.455
that it is a matter
of some pride...

49:35.215 --> 49:36.773
..immense privilege

49:36.775 --> 49:39.573
and not insignificant
encouragement...

49:39.575 --> 49:42.973
to be met here today in this
great metropolis of London

49:42.975 --> 49:46.253
with such a wide and devoted
body of reformers.

49:46.255 --> 49:47.973
Hear, hear.

49:47.975 --> 49:51.933
I am certain
that we have all, at times,

49:51.935 --> 49:54.773
faced with
the mighty forces of tyranny

49:54.775 --> 49:56.652
wielded by those in power...

49:58.015 --> 50:01.493
..felt that our actions
were of no more impact

50:01.495 --> 50:03.493
than the ripples thrown up

50:03.495 --> 50:06.373
by a single pebble
tossed into the sea.

50:06.375 --> 50:08.373
Hear, hear.

50:08.375 --> 50:13.935
But let us know, as we turn
to each other in this room,

50:15.535 --> 50:18.213
as we look
our fellow man in the eye,

50:18.215 --> 50:20.652
in the sure knowledge
that we gather here

50:20.654 --> 50:24.853
to protect and improve
the lives and future lives

50:24.855 --> 50:28.412
of the tens, the hundreds
of thousands of souls

50:28.414 --> 50:31.253
that we have the great honour
to represent...

50:32.855 --> 50:36.652
..let us know
that those ripples

50:36.654 --> 50:39.533
can and will begin to grow.

50:39.535 --> 50:41.973
- Aye!
- Hear, hear!

50:41.975 --> 50:45.893
They will grow
as we grow together.

50:45.895 --> 50:47.453
Aye.

50:47.455 --> 50:50.652
And as we combine, in courage,

50:50.654 --> 50:53.493
conviction
and companionship...

50:53.495 --> 50:54.893
Hear, hear.

50:54.895 --> 50:58.493
..those ripples
will become torrents,

50:58.495 --> 51:01.693
- will become waves...
- Hear, hear!

51:01.695 --> 51:05.333
..that will rise inexorably,

51:05.335 --> 51:08.893
until they begin
to pound this land

51:08.895 --> 51:13.733
and come crashing down
on the corrupt old order.

51:13.735 --> 51:16.093
Aye! Well said, sir!

51:16.095 --> 51:17.935
Hear, hear!

51:19.095 --> 51:23.333
So that from
the rich fertile ground,

51:23.335 --> 51:28.255
left behind by these
magnificent, mighty waves,

51:29.015 --> 51:33.612
will rise up the purest shoots

51:33.614 --> 51:36.612
of regrowth and renewal.

51:36.614 --> 51:39.253
- Aye! Huzzah!
- Hear, hear!

51:39.255 --> 51:41.292
Hear, hear!

51:41.294 --> 51:44.412
So that from our actions,

51:44.414 --> 51:48.173
actions forged by the needs,

51:48.175 --> 51:53.535
the cries, the ardent pleas
of our common man,

51:54.455 --> 51:57.253
we may put that common man

51:57.255 --> 52:00.412
at the heart of any
Commons House of Parliament.

52:02.695 --> 52:05.054
- Well said, sir!
- Hear, hear!

52:09.775 --> 52:13.612
One vote for each and all free men!

52:15.614 --> 52:19.813
Let that vote be cast
in secret, and annually.

52:19.815 --> 52:21.213
That is what we must seek.

52:24.654 --> 52:26.975
For let it never be in doubt...

52:28.575 --> 52:32.693
.. that there can finally be
no cessation

52:32.695 --> 52:37.573
of any reform that is
undeniably right, just,

52:37.575 --> 52:42.493
and in the overwhelming
interest of the multitude!

53:03.095 --> 53:05.093
Mr Hunt, sir.

53:05.095 --> 53:07.333
Pray pardon the intrusion, sir,

53:07.335 --> 53:09.533
but may I say
how heart-warming it is

53:09.535 --> 53:11.493
to hear a man
speak from the heart

53:11.495 --> 53:13.412
on a subject so close to our hearts.

53:13.414 --> 53:14.493
Aye.

53:14.495 --> 53:16.173
I thank you
for your kind words.

53:16.175 --> 53:19.693
We are fellow reformers, sir,
from Lancashire way.

53:19.695 --> 53:21.453
Indeed?

53:21.455 --> 53:24.173
Samuel Bamford
and Mr Joseph Healey.

53:24.175 --> 53:25.294
Dr Healey.

53:26.175 --> 53:27.693
Gentlemen.

53:27.695 --> 53:30.773
Would tha' care to join us
in a pot of ale, Mr Hunt?

53:30.775 --> 53:32.973
T'would be a great honour
for t'both of us.

53:32.975 --> 53:35.052
Alas, I must soon return
to my rooms

53:35.054 --> 53:37.215
but I thank you, gentlemen.

53:40.735 --> 53:42.735
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.

53:51.855 --> 53:54.015
Might I trouble you
to stand, sir?

53:56.775 --> 53:57.973
Thank you, sir.

53:57.975 --> 54:00.173
Have you misplaced something,
missus?

54:00.175 --> 54:01.775
Mouse droppings.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.853
You are Mr...

54:12.855 --> 54:15.054
- Richards.
- Mr Richards.

54:15.735 --> 54:18.895
And what can we do for you,
Mr Richards?

54:19.495 --> 54:22.015
It's more of a case of what
I can do for you, gentlemen.

54:22.614 --> 54:24.652
And what can you do for us,
Mr Richards?

54:24.654 --> 54:26.173
May I?

54:26.175 --> 54:28.693
If you must, but make haste.

54:28.695 --> 54:30.614
Thank you.

54:38.535 --> 54:41.215
I'm a patriot, just like you,
gentlemen.

54:44.375 --> 54:46.054
I would lay down my life
for my country.

54:51.375 --> 54:52.612
I have certain information

54:52.614 --> 54:54.975
that I believe would be
very useful to you.

54:56.414 --> 55:01.335
I have contacts...
skills, ways and means.

55:05.375 --> 55:07.255
Where do you hail from,
Mr Richards?

55:07.855 --> 55:09.213
Here and there. London.

55:09.215 --> 55:10.652
It's... hard to say.

55:10.654 --> 55:13.294
Have you visited
the North of England?

55:14.175 --> 55:15.533
Yes and no.

55:15.535 --> 55:18.453
But I'm familiar enough
with the North, sir.

55:18.455 --> 55:20.815
These contacts.
Are they in the North?

55:21.775 --> 55:22.933
Maybe.

55:22.935 --> 55:24.253
Debating clubs?

55:24.255 --> 55:26.052
Union societies?

55:26.054 --> 55:27.533
Reform meetings?

55:27.535 --> 55:29.333
Perhaps.

55:29.335 --> 55:31.612
Where? When?

55:31.614 --> 55:32.853
Soon.

55:32.855 --> 55:35.292
You receive visitors
in London?

55:35.294 --> 55:37.412
- From time to time.
- How many?

55:37.414 --> 55:38.973
Too many to count.

55:38.975 --> 55:40.573
Come, come, Mr Richards.

55:40.575 --> 55:42.213
We should need numbers
and names.

55:42.215 --> 55:44.175
But of course.

55:45.054 --> 55:46.255
At a price.

56:15.535 --> 56:18.054
"My Lords and Gentlemen...

56:19.375 --> 56:22.652
..it is with deep regret
that I am again obliged

56:22.654 --> 56:26.493
to announce to you
that no alteration has occurred

56:26.495 --> 56:28.693
in the state of my dear father,

56:28.695 --> 56:32.695
His Majesty the King's,
lamented indisposition.

56:35.015 --> 56:38.533
The distresses consequent upon
the termination of a war

56:38.535 --> 56:41.573
of such unusual extent
and duration

56:41.575 --> 56:45.373
have been felt,
with greater or less severity,

56:45.375 --> 56:47.935
throughout
all the nations of Europe.

56:49.054 --> 56:52.173
You will, I doubt not,

56:52.175 --> 56:54.373
feel a just indignation

56:54.375 --> 56:56.253
at the attempts
which have been made

56:56.255 --> 56:59.773
to take advantage of
the distresses of the country,

56:59.775 --> 57:02.292
for the purpose
of exciting a spirit

57:02.294 --> 57:05.013
of sedition and violence."

57:09.335 --> 57:15.533
"I am too well convinced of
the loyalty and good sense

57:15.535 --> 57:18.973
of the great body
of His Majesty's subjects,

57:18.975 --> 57:24.173
to believe them capable of
being perverted by the arts

57:24.175 --> 57:26.735
which are employed
to seduce them.

57:28.654 --> 57:33.213
But I am determined
to omit no precautions

57:33.215 --> 57:35.654
for preserving
the public peace,

57:36.575 --> 57:39.895
and for counteracting the
designs of the disaffected.

57:41.495 --> 57:44.853
And I rely with
the utmost confidence

57:44.855 --> 57:49.453
on your cordial support
and cooperation,

57:49.455 --> 57:54.093
in upholding a system
of law and government,

57:54.095 --> 57:57.693
which I deem to be
the most perfect

57:57.695 --> 58:01.973
that has ever fallen
to the lot of any people."

58:01.975 --> 58:03.975
Hear, hear!

58:21.054 --> 58:23.654
- Give us a potato.
- What?

58:29.975 --> 58:31.973
- Gi' us a tattie.
- What for?

58:31.975 --> 58:33.573
God save the Prince Regent!

58:33.575 --> 58:35.733
What're you doin'?
That's our supper!

58:35.735 --> 58:37.495
Ah! Ahh!

58:38.255 --> 58:39.775
Billy!

58:45.294 --> 58:47.375
Lord Chancellor!

58:48.735 --> 58:50.213
My Lords!

58:50.215 --> 58:54.412
I have one of the most
important communications

58:54.414 --> 58:55.933
to make to your Lordships,

58:55.935 --> 58:59.054
that has ever been made
to Parliament.

59:00.535 --> 59:05.213
His Royal Highness
was only now leaving this House

59:05.215 --> 59:09.453
when he was most viciously
attacked with a stone,

59:09.455 --> 59:14.412
or as some say, two balls,
fired from an air-gun...

59:14.414 --> 59:17.294
or some other
heinous instrument.

59:18.495 --> 59:20.573
The malignant spirit,

59:20.575 --> 59:23.813
born of the odious
French Revolution,

59:23.815 --> 59:27.853
is even now plainly
persuading our people

59:27.855 --> 59:29.893
that, alone by open violence,

59:29.895 --> 59:32.213
can their grievances
be redressed.

59:35.575 --> 59:39.733
I am deeply pained
upon this occasion,

59:39.735 --> 59:43.853
to state that I require
the suspension

59:43.855 --> 59:46.093
of the Habeas Corpus Act.

59:47.735 --> 59:50.013
And, my Lords,
I ask that this power

59:50.015 --> 59:52.652
should be communicated
without d-delay...

59:52.654 --> 59:55.173
Hear, hear!

59:55.175 --> 59:57.253
..for here procrastination

59:57.255 --> 01:00:00.733
would spell
nothing short of... ruin.

01:00:00.735 --> 01:00:02.654
Hear, hear.

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:10.853
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:00:10.855 --> 01:00:12.575
Good morning, Joseph.

01:00:14.575 --> 01:00:16.412
I bring us good fortune.

01:00:16.414 --> 01:00:18.813
- We can do with some of that.
- Aye.

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.493
I found this on Deansgate.

01:00:21.495 --> 01:00:23.173
How are you faring?
What tidings?

01:00:23.175 --> 01:00:25.453
- How's the brush trade, Joe?
- Grand. Grand.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.933
It thrives, John, it thrives.

01:00:26.935 --> 01:00:29.733
So, gentlemen, our response
to this evil action.

01:00:29.735 --> 01:00:31.773
- We must be clear.
- Indeed.

01:00:31.775 --> 01:00:33.453
We have a duty to our readers

01:00:33.455 --> 01:00:36.493
to explain
what a barbaric act this is.

01:00:36.495 --> 01:00:38.773
It may be that not every reader
will understand

01:00:38.775 --> 01:00:40.093
what Habeas Corpus means.

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:41.573
- Indeed.
- Exactly so.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.052
We must remind them.

01:00:43.054 --> 01:00:46.292
"Habeas Corpus means every
Briton's right to protection

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:49.933
against unlawful arrest
and detainment without charge."

01:00:49.935 --> 01:00:51.853
- Er... Good.
- It is a... a cornerstone

01:00:51.855 --> 01:00:53.333
- of our constitution.
- Aye.

01:00:53.335 --> 01:00:56.533
Without which the common man
is reduced to slavery.

01:00:56.535 --> 01:01:01.292
Yes. Now, "There are
three classes of men -

01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:06.095
lovers of wisdom, lovers of
honour and lovers of gain."

01:01:07.575 --> 01:01:08.733
Plato.

01:01:08.735 --> 01:01:11.612
We're aware it's Plato, John,
but is it truly to the matter?

01:01:11.614 --> 01:01:13.333
In my opinion, it is.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:15.453
I think not in this instant.

01:01:15.455 --> 01:01:18.333
- Jack not in this morning?
- Fetching paper supplies.

01:01:18.335 --> 01:01:20.733
- Grand, grand.
- Read that out, James.

01:01:20.735 --> 01:01:22.533
"It is the cornerstone
of our constitution

01:01:22.535 --> 01:01:23.612
without which
we are reduced to..."

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:25.573
Now then, lads.

01:01:25.575 --> 01:01:27.453
- Good morrow, gentlemen.
- Sam.

01:01:27.455 --> 01:01:28.533
Doctor.

01:01:28.535 --> 01:01:30.373
How are you going
at this end of t'country?

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:32.693
How are you going at
t'other end more to the point?

01:01:32.695 --> 01:01:34.973
- We've been to London.
- When did you get back up?

01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:36.493
- Last night.
- By coach.

01:01:36.495 --> 01:01:38.973
- We were inside.
- Aye, keeping out of t'rain.

01:01:38.975 --> 01:01:41.493
Please, gentlemen,
make yourselves comfortable.

01:01:41.495 --> 01:01:43.213
Aye.

01:01:43.215 --> 01:01:46.093
Smoky and dark as ever,
were London.

01:01:46.095 --> 01:01:48.453
Shan't be going back there
in a hurry.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.373
- There were uproar.
- An attack on t'Prince!

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.612
- Did you hear about it?
- So we heard, aye.

01:01:52.614 --> 01:01:54.173
There were talk of gunfire.

01:01:54.175 --> 01:01:56.412
- Pistol shot, rifle shot...
- Cannon fire.

01:01:56.414 --> 01:01:57.933
We heard
he was hit by a potato.

01:01:57.935 --> 01:01:59.612
Poor fat lad,

01:01:59.614 --> 01:02:01.933
wouldn't know what to do
wi' a raw potato.

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:05.693
But, think on this.

01:02:05.695 --> 01:02:09.533
We saw Mr Henry Hunt
addressing t'crowd.

01:02:09.535 --> 01:02:11.292
You saw Orator Hunt?

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.813
Orator Hunt.
Isn't that right, Doctor?

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:17.292
Aye, we saw him, we heard him
and we were moved by him.

01:02:17.294 --> 01:02:20.013
- That right, Sam?
- Aye, at Elephant And Castle.

01:02:20.015 --> 01:02:23.652
Never afore did I see a man
so gifted in public speak -

01:02:23.654 --> 01:02:26.373
and I've heard a few
in my time.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.093
Tha'self included, John.

01:02:28.095 --> 01:02:29.773
You're not so bad
on the hustings, Sam.

01:02:29.775 --> 01:02:31.973
Aye, I have
a certain following.

01:02:31.975 --> 01:02:34.573
But not like this man.
It's as if he were born to it.

01:02:34.575 --> 01:02:37.813
- We can all deliver a speech.
- Do not get me wrong, John.

01:02:37.815 --> 01:02:41.333
I'm not saying that
tha'self cannot turn a phrase,

01:02:41.335 --> 01:02:44.853
but this feller, he knows
how to unite the crowd.

01:02:44.855 --> 01:02:47.093
- Do we not all do that?
- Aye, but...

01:02:47.095 --> 01:02:50.933
he speaks with a...
a passion and a fervour

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:53.052
about t'same matters
and t'same concerns

01:02:53.054 --> 01:02:55.495
we've all been preaching about
these past years,

01:02:56.095 --> 01:02:59.654
but when he does it,
the crowd, they follow him.

01:03:00.855 --> 01:03:02.493
They're in t'palm of his hand.

01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:04.052
They say he's not a modest man.

01:03:04.054 --> 01:03:07.292
Aye, "vainglorious",
I've heard folk describe him.

01:03:07.294 --> 01:03:09.412
Well, I daresay
he's not perfect.

01:03:09.414 --> 01:03:12.052
- Who of us here is?
- Was he wearing his white hat?

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.213
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:03:13.215 --> 01:03:15.813
He were wearing his white hat.
So you could see him, aye.

01:03:15.815 --> 01:03:17.294
You wouldn't miss him
in t'crowd.

01:03:18.414 --> 01:03:20.093
- Jack.
- Good day, gentlemen.

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:22.412
- Jack. How do?
- Jack.

01:03:22.414 --> 01:03:24.015
Here he is.

01:03:25.455 --> 01:03:27.853
- Is he not a landowner?
- Aye, he is, James,

01:03:27.855 --> 01:03:30.693
and a countryman -
and a wealthy one at that.

01:03:30.695 --> 01:03:33.733
And that gives him
the wherewithal and the ability

01:03:33.735 --> 01:03:36.573
to fight for liberty
and reform.

01:03:36.575 --> 01:03:39.652
- True, true.
- Now think on this.

01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:42.693
If you lads,
through your newspaper,

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:44.855
and t'Manchester
Patriotic Union,

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:50.093
are planning this big
public meeting at Peter's Field

01:03:50.095 --> 01:03:52.773
to discuss universal suffrage

01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:55.612
and the election of
a representative for Manchester

01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:59.493
in Parliament, then surely you
would want Henry Hunt

01:03:59.495 --> 01:04:01.612
addressing t'crowd
alongside t'rest of us.

01:04:01.614 --> 01:04:04.453
We don't need some fancy dandy
coming up here,

01:04:04.455 --> 01:04:05.893
taking over the show.

01:04:05.895 --> 01:04:09.333
Hey, John Saxton,
I come here to speak as I find.

01:04:09.335 --> 01:04:11.533
Thy prejudice
is thine own affair.

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:14.173
But will he be as effectual
up here with our people,

01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:15.893
as he is down there
with London folk?

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:17.612
- Aye.
- He would be effectual

01:04:17.614 --> 01:04:19.292
anywhere in t'country

01:04:19.294 --> 01:04:21.693
as long as there were
a crowd to listen to him.

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:24.253
From John O'Groats
to t'Land's End.

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:25.294
Did you speak to him?

01:04:25.975 --> 01:04:28.093
We made ourselves known to him,
aye.

01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:30.493
- We told him our business.
- And what was he like?

01:04:30.495 --> 01:04:31.893
In himself.

01:04:31.895 --> 01:04:36.093
Why... you'd be...
hard pushed to say.

01:04:36.095 --> 01:04:37.573
- He were...
- Aye.

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:40.015
- He has a round face.
- Aye.

01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:44.173
You might say
he were a bit bland.

01:04:44.175 --> 01:04:47.253
Aye, but I do hear tell
he has his own brewery.

01:04:47.255 --> 01:04:49.375
Aye. True, true.

01:04:50.815 --> 01:04:53.733
Now, if I am done here,

01:04:53.735 --> 01:04:57.213
my good wife has promised me
a hot potato pie

01:04:57.215 --> 01:05:00.773
on my return to Middleton,
so if tha' will allow me, John,

01:05:00.775 --> 01:05:03.975
I shall be making my way up
t'bank to avail myself of it.

01:05:05.095 --> 01:05:07.453
We shall give this matter
our due consideration.

01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:10.013
- Aye. Well, think on.
- Good day, gentlemen.

01:05:10.015 --> 01:05:12.453
- Good day.
- See thee later, lads.

01:05:12.455 --> 01:05:13.612
Good day.

01:05:13.614 --> 01:05:16.773
- Where are we up to, Jack?
- Just off three hundred.

01:05:16.775 --> 01:05:18.773
Can you not go any faster?

01:05:18.775 --> 01:05:20.533
A faster printer
you'll not find

01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:21.853
in the whole
of Manchester.

01:05:21.855 --> 01:05:23.893
Thank you, sir.

01:05:23.895 --> 01:05:26.495
Right, gentlemen, I must away.

01:05:27.495 --> 01:05:28.813
- Good day.
- Good day.

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:29.775
Good day.

01:05:50.975 --> 01:05:53.054
Here's tha' beer, Joseph.

01:06:01.775 --> 01:06:03.695
- Who's tha' writing to?
- Hush, woman.

01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:14.455
I am writing to the great
orator, Mr Henry Hunt...

01:06:15.215 --> 01:06:16.975
..Esquire.

01:06:18.335 --> 01:06:19.935
Oh.

01:06:23.614 --> 01:06:25.573
Here is the intercepted mail,
Mr Grout.

01:06:25.575 --> 01:06:27.495
Thank you, Mr Cobb.

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.253
Hmm. Exactly so.

01:06:39.255 --> 01:06:41.292
Most definitely, Mr Grout.

01:06:41.294 --> 01:06:43.775
Yes, I concur, Mr Golightly.

01:06:50.495 --> 01:06:52.695
Who is this Johnson?

01:06:53.855 --> 01:06:55.573
He holds a position
of influence

01:06:55.575 --> 01:06:57.933
amongst the middle class
radicals of Manchester.

01:06:57.935 --> 01:06:59.614
He is a brush manufacturer.

01:07:00.775 --> 01:07:02.573
A brush manufacturer?

01:07:02.575 --> 01:07:04.533
Apparently.

01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:05.853
There is now little doubt

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.052
that this mass meeting
will take place.

01:07:08.054 --> 01:07:10.453
- Legally, we cannot ban it.
- Alas, not.

01:07:10.455 --> 01:07:13.533
A working class upstart orator
is one thing,

01:07:13.535 --> 01:07:16.333
but a land-owning,
self-styled man of the people

01:07:16.335 --> 01:07:18.493
like Hunt is quite another.

01:07:18.495 --> 01:07:20.893
We cannot allow
this Wiltshire peacock

01:07:20.895 --> 01:07:22.652
to incite
the disaffected masses

01:07:22.654 --> 01:07:26.333
under the spurious guise
of parliamentary reform.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:30.453
This is a powder keg which will
ignite at the slightest spark.

01:07:30.455 --> 01:07:31.773
I believe it prudent

01:07:31.775 --> 01:07:33.693
that we write to General
Byng immediately.

01:07:33.695 --> 01:07:38.813
Indeed. Instruct him
to increase his forces

01:07:38.815 --> 01:07:41.813
to the utmost degree possible.

01:07:41.815 --> 01:07:44.093
- Post haste, my Lord.
- And, Hobhouse,

01:07:44.095 --> 01:07:46.773
insist that
the local magistrates

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:49.695
exercise
the greatest restraint.

01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:53.335
Very good, my Lord.

01:08:00.575 --> 01:08:02.412
Dear sisters,

01:08:02.414 --> 01:08:05.773
welcome to the Manchester
Female Reform Society.

01:08:05.775 --> 01:08:07.253
They said we've got to pay,

01:08:07.255 --> 01:08:09.573
but I'm not paying 'cos I
'aven't got owt to give.

01:08:09.575 --> 01:08:13.253
There is no money to be given
if you do not have it.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.294
Please, do take a seat.

01:08:16.535 --> 01:08:17.935
I'm right standing, thank you.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.095
As you wish.

01:08:21.255 --> 01:08:23.612
As I'm sure you are all aware,

01:08:23.613 --> 01:08:26.412
there is to be a great meeting
at St Peter's Field

01:08:26.413 --> 01:08:28.495
to further the cause of reform.

01:08:29.535 --> 01:08:33.453
We have reviewed
for a considerable time past

01:08:33.455 --> 01:08:38.412
the apathy and frequent insult
of our oppressed countrymen

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:41.212
by the borough-mongering
aristocracy.

01:08:47.854 --> 01:08:51.292
And in order to accelerate
the emancipation

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:55.533
of our suffering nation,
we do declare that we will

01:08:55.535 --> 01:08:58.893
assist the male union
formed in this town,

01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:02.173
with all the might and energy
that we possess,

01:09:02.175 --> 01:09:05.853
in obtaining the object
of our common solicitude.

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.933
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:11.013
- Give over and sit down.
- No, she's right.

01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:13.173
I don't understand
what she's saying neither.

01:09:13.175 --> 01:09:14.694
- No.
- Ladies, please,

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:17.013
you will all
get a chance to speak.

01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:20.093
Pray silence for our president,
Mrs Fildes.

01:09:20.095 --> 01:09:22.212
Thank you, Susanna.

01:09:22.215 --> 01:09:24.813
One man, one vote.

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:37.095
Representation for all of us,
for each and every family.

01:09:37.814 --> 01:09:39.575
Hear, hear!

01:09:43.215 --> 01:09:46.332
We are neither ashamed,
nor afraid,

01:09:46.335 --> 01:09:49.013
of thus aiding our menfolk,

01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:53.495
and we are actuated
by no motives of petty vanity.

01:09:54.215 --> 01:09:59.693
We come together as wives,
mothers, daughters and sisters

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:03.973
in our social, domestic
and moral capacities.

01:10:03.975 --> 01:10:05.255
Aye.

01:10:09.735 --> 01:10:13.373
May our flag never be unfurled

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:18.453
but in the sacred cause
of liberty, peace and reform,

01:10:18.455 --> 01:10:21.773
and then may a female's curse

01:10:21.775 --> 01:10:25.213
pursue the coward
who deserts the standard.

01:10:25.215 --> 01:10:27.175
Aye!

01:10:36.294 --> 01:10:40.612
And now, ladies, our secretary,
Mrs Susanna Saxton,

01:10:40.614 --> 01:10:42.412
will say a few words.

01:10:46.255 --> 01:10:48.493
Sisters of the earth,

01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:51.453
how could you bear to see
the infant at the breast

01:10:51.455 --> 01:10:54.533
drawing from you the remnants
of your last blood,

01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:57.533
instead of the nourishment
which nature requires?

01:10:57.535 --> 01:10:59.453
The only subsistence
for yourselves

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.535
being a draught of cold water.

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:04.373
We can no longer bear to see

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:07.612
numbers of our parents
immured in workhouses,

01:11:07.614 --> 01:11:09.773
our fathers separated
from our mothers

01:11:09.775 --> 01:11:13.375
in direct contradiction to
the laws of God and man,

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:17.412
our sons degraded
below human nature,

01:11:17.414 --> 01:11:20.013
our husbands and our
little ones clothed in rags

01:11:20.015 --> 01:11:22.573
and pining
on the face of the earth.

01:11:22.575 --> 01:11:25.412
Our enemies are resolved
upon destroying

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:28.093
the last vestige
of the natural rights of man,

01:11:28.095 --> 01:11:30.095
and we are determined
to establish it.

01:11:31.255 --> 01:11:32.693
For as well
might they attempt

01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:34.612
to arrest the sun
in the region of space,

01:11:34.614 --> 01:11:36.933
or stop the diurnal motion
of the earth,

01:11:36.935 --> 01:11:38.853
as to impede
the rapid progress

01:11:38.855 --> 01:11:41.412
of our enlightened friends
to liberty and truth.

01:11:41.414 --> 01:11:43.213
You're talking bullscutter,
an' all.

01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:45.373
- Be quiet!
- You be quiet!

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:48.093
No, you sit down now
and stop your brabblement.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:50.575
Order! Ladies, please!

01:11:51.535 --> 01:11:52.853
We cannot bear

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:56.093
the ponderous weight
of our chains any longer.

01:11:56.095 --> 01:11:58.213
But we must tear them asunder

01:11:58.215 --> 01:12:01.173
and dash them in the face of
our remorseless oppressors,

01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:04.093
who have nearly picked bare
the bones of those who labour.

01:12:04.095 --> 01:12:06.013
- They have, they have!
- Aye, they have!

01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:08.933
The founder of Christianity,
Jesus Christ,

01:12:08.935 --> 01:12:11.255
He was the greatest reformer
of all.

01:12:12.335 --> 01:12:15.253
Sisters, the bitter cup
of oppression

01:12:15.255 --> 01:12:17.373
is now full to the brim.

01:12:20.775 --> 01:12:22.693
Well done, Susanna.

01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:25.815
It's true! It's true is that.

01:12:26.695 --> 01:12:29.173
We come out on strike
last year.

01:12:29.175 --> 01:12:30.773
We were out seven weeks,
wasn't we?

01:12:30.775 --> 01:12:32.533
Aye, we wa'!

01:12:32.535 --> 01:12:34.533
They beat us back to work

01:12:34.535 --> 01:12:37.693
and we've got nowt
to show for it, nowt!

01:12:37.695 --> 01:12:40.093
I've got two lads to feed
and nowt to give 'em.

01:12:40.095 --> 01:12:42.652
- Be quiet, the both of you!
- No, you be quiet!

01:12:42.654 --> 01:12:45.013
- You be quiet!
- Don't you belder at me.

01:12:45.015 --> 01:12:46.213
Ladies!

01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:49.255
Let us move on to the next
subject on the agenda.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:55.255
So... let me
get this straight, now.

01:12:55.975 --> 01:12:57.573
There's going to be
a big march.

01:12:57.575 --> 01:12:59.493
- Aye!
- At Peter's Field.

01:12:59.495 --> 01:13:00.652
- Outside?
- Aye.

01:13:00.654 --> 01:13:02.292
- Not indoors?
- No.

01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:04.373
- In broad daylight?
- Yes!

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.373
- On a Monday.
- A Monday?

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.412
- I know, it's daft.
- Second Monday in August.

01:13:09.414 --> 01:13:10.853
- Not go to work?
- Aye.

01:13:10.855 --> 01:13:12.573
They'll have to make do
without us.

01:13:12.575 --> 01:13:13.813
We'll get the sack!

01:13:13.815 --> 01:13:15.493
Not if all the mills turn out.

01:13:15.495 --> 01:13:16.773
You're playing with fire.

01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:18.693
No, Mother,
this one'll be different.

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:19.933
Different? How?

01:13:19.935 --> 01:13:22.573
There's hundreds going,
women and children an' all.

01:13:22.575 --> 01:13:24.652
We've to turn out
in our Sunday best.

01:13:24.654 --> 01:13:27.093
Ah, well, I best get
me darning needles out, then.

01:13:27.095 --> 01:13:30.052
Aye, you should, same as
t'rest of t'street will be.

01:13:30.054 --> 01:13:31.573
I know they will,

01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:34.813
but so will that Nadin
and his bullies, the swine.

01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:36.453
They'll have to get past them!

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:39.493
Aye, but people have been
practising marching peacefully.

01:13:39.495 --> 01:13:40.652
Haven't they, Father?

01:13:40.654 --> 01:13:42.893
Oh, aye, up on Kersal Moor,
they say.

01:13:42.895 --> 01:13:45.652
- Childer?
- Aye, 'ole families.

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.773
It's a day out for everybody.

01:13:47.775 --> 01:13:49.893
We've to stand up
for ourselves, Esther.

01:13:49.895 --> 01:13:52.213
We can't go on being afraid.

01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:56.335
I know, love, but we've all
got to be careful, though.

01:15:16.535 --> 01:15:18.975
John! John Bagguley?

01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:21.052
Aye?

01:15:21.054 --> 01:15:22.775
It's an honour to meet you,
sir.

01:15:23.614 --> 01:15:25.175
Your reputation precedes you.

01:15:27.095 --> 01:15:29.412
They say you're a great orator.

01:15:29.414 --> 01:15:30.573
Do they?

01:15:30.575 --> 01:15:35.015
Your message is strong
and clear... and true.

01:15:38.495 --> 01:15:40.455
You're not from
around these parts, are you?

01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:44.255
I'm a radical, John -
just like yourself.

01:15:46.535 --> 01:15:48.735
- Greetings, friend.
- Greetings.

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:53.414
May I ask you a question, John?

01:15:55.495 --> 01:15:57.495
Are you as angry as I am?

01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:01.093
I am angry.

01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:03.375
But are you angry enough?

01:16:06.735 --> 01:16:09.294
People need to see
how angry we are, John.

01:16:11.294 --> 01:16:13.533
Rise up.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.294
Fight!

01:16:16.095 --> 01:16:18.935
Violence... hatred...

01:16:19.855 --> 01:16:21.493
..destruction.

01:16:21.495 --> 01:16:23.175
We are prepared.

01:16:23.855 --> 01:16:25.493
We have arms ready.

01:16:25.495 --> 01:16:27.054
Then use 'em.

01:16:30.175 --> 01:16:32.375
When the time is right...

01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:34.895
..we will.

01:16:35.935 --> 01:16:37.775
The time is now, John.

01:16:43.775 --> 01:16:45.455
Until next time.

01:16:46.495 --> 01:16:47.815
Call me Oliver.

01:17:29.455 --> 01:17:33.455
Friends...
thank you for being here today.

01:17:34.535 --> 01:17:37.373
But let me state
this meeting will be short,

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:39.933
as the suspension of
Habeas Corpus is upon us.

01:17:42.175 --> 01:17:44.853
This is not the end.

01:17:44.855 --> 01:17:47.173
No, this is only the beginning.

01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:49.652
Aye.

01:17:49.654 --> 01:17:52.093
But permit me to say...

01:17:52.095 --> 01:17:55.612
that when the power...
of any government...

01:17:55.614 --> 01:17:59.652
is in the hands of
an agreed number of persons,

01:17:59.654 --> 01:18:01.412
whose interest together

01:18:01.414 --> 01:18:03.052
with the interest
of the government

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:06.535
are different and distinct
to that of the people...

01:18:07.294 --> 01:18:09.693
..well, so then such is
the case,

01:18:09.695 --> 01:18:13.373
the speedy destruction
of our nation is inevitable.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:15.935
Hear, hear! Hear, hear.

01:18:17.654 --> 01:18:19.535
Thank you for your time.

01:18:20.735 --> 01:18:24.654
Thank you. My friend, Samuel
Drummond, will now speak.

01:18:26.015 --> 01:18:28.453
Thank you, Mr John Bagguley.

01:18:28.455 --> 01:18:32.573
Friends, I will only speak
very briefly today.

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:34.693
The time for speaking is over.

01:18:34.695 --> 01:18:37.375
Now...
Now is the time for action.

01:18:39.294 --> 01:18:42.373
Our chief intention
is to restore to you

01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:45.373
your long lost liberty
by you arming yourselves,

01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:47.173
and being strong and resolute

01:18:47.175 --> 01:18:50.292
and ready to win back your
ancient rights for yourselves.

01:18:50.294 --> 01:18:52.052
- Aye.
- Hear, hear!

01:18:52.054 --> 01:18:54.573
Now is the time for action!
Now.

01:18:54.575 --> 01:18:56.973
Not tomorrow, not next week.

01:18:56.975 --> 01:18:58.855
- Now!
- Hear, hear!

01:18:59.654 --> 01:19:01.052
For my part,

01:19:01.054 --> 01:19:05.973
I will stick to you until my
last drop of blood is expended.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:08.733
If the whole host of hell
come against me,

01:19:08.735 --> 01:19:10.412
I will not stir an inch,

01:19:10.414 --> 01:19:13.173
because I know
our cause is true and just,

01:19:13.175 --> 01:19:16.333
and the Lord Himself shines
His heavenly light upon us.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:17.893
Hear, hear!

01:19:17.895 --> 01:19:20.612
Get all armed!

01:19:20.614 --> 01:19:23.775
Give me my liberty,
or let me die.

01:19:24.575 --> 01:19:26.453
Liberty or death!

01:19:26.455 --> 01:19:28.455
Liberty or death!

01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:30.695
Liberty or death!

01:19:31.175 --> 01:19:32.895
Liberty or death!

01:19:33.414 --> 01:19:35.215
Liberty or death!

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:37.495
I thank you.

01:19:41.294 --> 01:19:44.255
My friend, John Johnston,
will now say a few words.

01:19:57.294 --> 01:19:58.975
Fellow countrymen...

01:20:02.095 --> 01:20:06.292
..the time has come
to rise from your lethargy.

01:20:06.294 --> 01:20:07.813
- Aye.
- Yes.

01:20:07.815 --> 01:20:10.773
No longer will our blood,
sweat and toil

01:20:10.775 --> 01:20:13.612
line the pockets of
the avaricious aristocracy

01:20:13.614 --> 01:20:15.333
and the landowners.

01:20:15.335 --> 01:20:20.573
No longer will the curdled
screams of starving children

01:20:20.575 --> 01:20:24.535
echo through the streets of
Manchester and beyond.

01:20:25.414 --> 01:20:28.693
Our French brethren
have shown us the way.

01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:34.612
We must punish our mad king
and his gluttonous offspring

01:20:34.614 --> 01:20:36.853
by taking off their heads!

01:20:36.855 --> 01:20:38.695
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

01:20:39.614 --> 01:20:43.173
I declare to that God
that gave me being,

01:20:43.175 --> 01:20:45.173
that superintends my actions,

01:20:45.175 --> 01:20:47.052
that one day,
I must give an answer

01:20:47.054 --> 01:20:48.773
for all that I do
on this earth,

01:20:48.775 --> 01:20:53.052
that whenever... whenever
it lies within my power,

01:20:53.054 --> 01:20:55.533
- I will strike them down!
- Aye!

01:20:55.535 --> 01:20:57.693
And, if I cannot effect it,

01:20:57.695 --> 01:21:00.573
I hope the women
of this great nation

01:21:00.575 --> 01:21:02.973
will tear them
limb from bleeding limb

01:21:02.975 --> 01:21:05.813
like the Maenads
on Mount Cithaeron!

01:21:05.815 --> 01:21:08.533
- Yes!
- Arm yourselves!

01:21:08.535 --> 01:21:10.933
Bring pistols, guns,
swords and pikes,

01:21:10.935 --> 01:21:13.533
and if you cannot
attain these weapons,

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.693
bring yourself
a pair of tongs and a poker,

01:21:16.695 --> 01:21:18.612
hot from the fire!

01:21:18.614 --> 01:21:20.573
Be ready, lads,

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:22.052
and true to yourselves!

01:21:22.054 --> 01:21:25.052
Give me liberty,
or give me death!

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:27.693
Liberty or death!

01:21:27.695 --> 01:21:29.773
Liberty or death!

01:21:29.775 --> 01:21:31.893
Liberty or death!

01:21:31.895 --> 01:21:33.813
Liberty or death!

01:21:33.815 --> 01:21:35.975
Let's go.

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:54.253
You bastard!
Let go of me, you bastard!

01:21:54.255 --> 01:21:57.213
- I shall never be defeated!
- You will not silence us!

01:21:57.215 --> 01:21:59.493
- We will never relent.
- Hey, you bastard!

01:21:59.495 --> 01:22:02.693
We will never give up
the fight for liberty!

01:22:02.695 --> 01:22:04.975
Liberty or death!

01:22:05.815 --> 01:22:07.855
Liberty or death!

01:22:08.855 --> 01:22:12.695
You cannot confine us to these
receptacles of the damned!

01:22:13.654 --> 01:22:15.412
Get in. Get in!

01:22:17.855 --> 01:22:20.935
I'm going to smash your teeth
down your throat!

01:22:22.095 --> 01:22:24.693
Get in! Get in!

01:22:24.695 --> 01:22:27.015
No! No!

01:22:27.775 --> 01:22:30.533
Get off me, you bastard!

01:22:30.535 --> 01:22:32.775
Get off! Oww!

01:22:33.654 --> 01:22:35.693
Get off me!

01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:43.495
Jesus Christ Himself
was the greatest ever reformer!

01:22:44.455 --> 01:22:46.573
You will not silence our cause.

01:23:00.535 --> 01:23:02.695
Help!

01:23:13.015 --> 01:23:17.375
Left, right. Left, right.

01:23:20.775 --> 01:23:22.654
Stand still!

01:23:24.015 --> 01:23:25.495
About face, gentlemen!

01:23:29.215 --> 01:23:30.935
Dressings!

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.292
Quick march!

01:23:35.294 --> 01:23:37.294
Listen to the drum.

01:23:40.535 --> 01:23:42.333
Swing your arms.

01:23:42.335 --> 01:23:44.095
By the right.

01:23:45.695 --> 01:23:48.575
Move to the right!
Right face!

01:23:51.414 --> 01:23:52.893
Pick up your dressings!

01:23:52.895 --> 01:23:54.535
Right, then left.

01:24:01.455 --> 01:24:03.575
Keep dressing from the right!

01:24:04.855 --> 01:24:06.495
Swing those arms!

01:24:08.975 --> 01:24:11.292
Pick up your dressings,
gentlemen!

01:24:11.294 --> 01:24:13.412
Let's have a bit of pride!

01:24:33.654 --> 01:24:34.855
Mr Hunt?

01:24:36.015 --> 01:24:38.453
Joseph Johnson
of the Manchester Observer.

01:24:38.455 --> 01:24:40.493
Ah, Mr Johnson.

01:24:40.495 --> 01:24:43.612
Er... This is Mr Knight,
Mr Saxton and Mrs Saxton,

01:24:43.614 --> 01:24:46.412
the Secretary of the Manchester
Female Reform Society.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:47.933
- Good evening, Mr Hunt.
- Madam.

01:24:47.935 --> 01:24:49.412
- Welcome.
- How kind.

01:24:49.414 --> 01:24:50.693
- Good day sir.
- Mr Hunt.

01:24:50.695 --> 01:24:52.373
Gentlemen. At last.

01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:55.333
We should like to thank you
for enduring your long journey.

01:24:55.335 --> 01:24:56.573
Welcome to Manchester.

01:24:56.575 --> 01:24:59.093
I shall indeed look forward
to a good night's repose

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.614
in anticipation of
tomorrow's exertions.

01:25:02.535 --> 01:25:04.813
Mr Hunt, I regret to inform you
that the meeting

01:25:04.815 --> 01:25:06.612
will no longer
take place tomorrow.

01:25:06.614 --> 01:25:08.612
It has been postponed, Mr Hunt,

01:25:08.614 --> 01:25:10.855
until tomorrow week, the 16th.

01:25:11.654 --> 01:25:12.813
For what reason, pray?

01:25:12.815 --> 01:25:15.173
Due to circumstances
beyond our control.

01:25:15.175 --> 01:25:16.733
What circumstances?

01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:18.973
Our intention was that
the meeting should consider

01:25:18.975 --> 01:25:20.893
the propriety of
electing a so-called

01:25:20.895 --> 01:25:23.373
Parliamentary representative
for this district.

01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:25.893
Mr Johnson, did I not
stipulate that my attendance

01:25:25.895 --> 01:25:27.733
here in Manchester
was conditional

01:25:27.735 --> 01:25:30.693
upon there being no mention
of any such illegal election?

01:25:30.695 --> 01:25:32.853
We were not planning
to hold an election, sir,

01:25:32.855 --> 01:25:35.292
merely to discuss
the possibility of an election.

01:25:35.294 --> 01:25:37.813
Aye. The magistrates
misunderstood our intentions.

01:25:37.815 --> 01:25:40.612
Because it was a foolish
proposition in the first place.

01:25:40.614 --> 01:25:42.533
Mr Hunt, as you very well know,

01:25:42.535 --> 01:25:45.052
Manchester has no
Parliamentary representation.

01:25:45.054 --> 01:25:47.973
- We do not. It's a scandal.
- Time is pressing.

01:25:47.975 --> 01:25:50.093
You, of all people, know that.

01:25:50.095 --> 01:25:52.933
Yes, Mr Saxton, I am well aware
that time is pressing.

01:25:52.935 --> 01:25:56.652
That is why I cannot spend one
week of my life in Manchester.

01:25:56.654 --> 01:25:59.453
But thousands of people
are eager to hear you speak.

01:25:59.455 --> 01:26:01.933
Then I shall leave it to you
to explain my absence.

01:26:01.935 --> 01:26:05.173
Sir, there will be a great
outcry if you do not appear.

01:26:05.175 --> 01:26:07.373
- It will be carnage.
- Only your presence

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:09.573
can promote tranquillity
and good order.

01:26:09.575 --> 01:26:11.735
Sir, please let us conduct you
to your hotel.

01:26:18.054 --> 01:26:19.575
That is out of the question.

01:26:20.335 --> 01:26:22.093
With my name,
any longer than one night

01:26:22.095 --> 01:26:23.693
in any hotel in this land,

01:26:23.695 --> 01:26:25.813
and the place will be
swarming with spies.

01:26:25.815 --> 01:26:28.855
Then we must find
more secluded accommodation.

01:26:38.614 --> 01:26:40.652
This is where I reside,
Mr Hunt.

01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:52.015
Leave it there.

01:26:56.255 --> 01:26:57.175
Mr Hunt?

01:27:02.294 --> 01:27:03.453
Good evening, madam.

01:27:03.455 --> 01:27:05.652
This is my dear wife,
Mrs Johnson.

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.292
Mr Henry Hunt.

01:27:07.294 --> 01:27:09.893
Mr Johnson, if I could perhaps
be shown to my rooms?

01:27:09.895 --> 01:27:12.935
Indeed.
Sarah, show Mr Hunt upstairs.

01:27:15.015 --> 01:27:16.495
Oh. Erm...

01:27:17.975 --> 01:27:19.414
This way, Mr Hunt.

01:27:23.654 --> 01:27:25.693
If you would provide me
with some writing materials?

01:27:25.695 --> 01:27:27.535
- Very well.
- And my trunk.

01:27:30.335 --> 01:27:33.453
Mrs Johnson, if you could
bring me a light repast?

01:27:33.455 --> 01:27:35.455
What's that?

01:27:46.414 --> 01:27:48.213
- I thank you, Sir John.
- A pleasure.

01:27:48.215 --> 01:27:50.493
Always good to see you, Guy.
Now, to be clear,

01:27:50.495 --> 01:27:52.733
I myself may not be present
at this little gathering.

01:27:52.735 --> 01:27:53.853
Indeed, I understand that.

01:27:53.855 --> 01:27:55.853
I have other matters
to attend to,

01:27:55.855 --> 01:27:57.853
but I have every confidence
in you, old boy.

01:27:57.855 --> 01:27:59.292
I shall endeavour
to do my best, sir.

01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:01.054
Stout fellow. Your horse.

01:28:46.535 --> 01:28:47.933
Aye, aye.

01:28:47.935 --> 01:28:49.612
Ah, good morning, Joseph.

01:28:49.614 --> 01:28:50.973
Go on.

01:28:50.975 --> 01:28:51.973
No.

01:28:51.975 --> 01:28:54.412
- Are they not ready yet?
- No.

01:28:54.414 --> 01:28:56.412
Not while this afternoon,
you said.

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.495
- Right.
- Give us a look.

01:28:59.015 --> 01:29:00.975
That one in't done yet.

01:29:01.735 --> 01:29:03.414
It's grand.

01:29:06.654 --> 01:29:08.095
Good.

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:17.493
We are in a state of
painful uncertainty, Sir John.

01:29:17.495 --> 01:29:18.973
- We are.
- No doubt.

01:29:18.975 --> 01:29:22.652
And we feel comforted
and assured by your presence,

01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:25.612
your prowess in dealing
with civil disorder,

01:29:25.614 --> 01:29:28.213
and in the knowledge
that we are in your safe hands.

01:29:28.215 --> 01:29:29.893
- Hear, hear.
- Indeed.

01:29:29.895 --> 01:29:31.733
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:29:31.735 --> 01:29:34.573
However, at this stage, I would
urge you to show caution,

01:29:34.575 --> 01:29:36.853
and to abstain from
any precipitous acts.

01:29:36.855 --> 01:29:38.813
General,
with the greatest of respect,

01:29:38.815 --> 01:29:40.213
the time for caution is over.

01:29:40.215 --> 01:29:43.052
Sir, I am of the opinion
that the presence alone

01:29:43.054 --> 01:29:45.973
of the civil and military force
that we have in readiness

01:29:45.975 --> 01:29:48.853
is sufficient to deter
any conceivable sedition.

01:29:48.855 --> 01:29:50.813
You're speaking of insurrection.

01:29:50.815 --> 01:29:54.773
Indeed. Moreover we cannot
allow these radicals

01:29:54.775 --> 01:29:57.013
to follow the example
of their French brethren

01:29:57.015 --> 01:29:58.213
on the 16th of August.

01:29:58.215 --> 01:30:02.612
Mr Norris, the General's
very attendance upon the day

01:30:02.614 --> 01:30:06.294
will ensure that no such
catastrophe can possibly occur.

01:30:07.575 --> 01:30:11.333
Gentlemen, regarding
my attendance upon the day.

01:30:11.335 --> 01:30:15.013
My attention may be called
to other quarters,

01:30:15.015 --> 01:30:17.093
and I do not find myself
in a position

01:30:17.095 --> 01:30:19.575
wherein I can guarantee
my presence.

01:30:22.495 --> 01:30:24.292
Am I to understand
that you will have

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:26.333
more pressing business elsewhere?

01:30:26.335 --> 01:30:28.612
There is
a distinct possibility.

01:30:28.614 --> 01:30:30.493
But, I have
the utmost confidence

01:30:30.495 --> 01:30:32.813
in my second in command,
Colonel L'Estrange.

01:30:32.815 --> 01:30:34.215
He is a fine soldier.

01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.373
I see.

01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:37.853
L'Estrange.

01:30:37.855 --> 01:30:39.654
Indeed, sir.

01:31:08.294 --> 01:31:11.612
Mr Tuke, is this to take up
much more of my time?

01:31:11.614 --> 01:31:13.052
No, Mr Hunt.

01:31:13.054 --> 01:31:15.935
The stiller you sit,
the sooner we'll be done.

01:31:20.255 --> 01:31:22.054
Arm down, please.

01:31:23.414 --> 01:31:25.333
Am I permitted to use
my right arm?

01:31:25.335 --> 01:31:28.213
You may use your right arm as
long as it does not impede

01:31:28.215 --> 01:31:30.695
on our progress
with your left arm.

01:31:36.815 --> 01:31:39.255
May I enquire as to the nature
of your speech, Mr Hunt?

01:31:41.335 --> 01:31:44.013
It concerns
the inalienable civil liberties

01:31:44.015 --> 01:31:46.614
- of all free men.
- Does it, now?

01:31:50.054 --> 01:31:52.373
My wife expresses
something of an interest

01:31:52.375 --> 01:31:54.654
in attending your gathering
on Monday.

01:31:55.975 --> 01:31:57.533
Will you not be attending
with her?

01:31:57.535 --> 01:32:00.815
No. I'm not one
for too much talk.

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.973
Mr Hunt, please.

01:32:08.975 --> 01:32:11.013
Miss?

01:32:11.015 --> 01:32:12.815
Would you be so kind
as to hold down my papers?

01:32:14.455 --> 01:32:16.575
Hold down t'papers?

01:32:17.414 --> 01:32:19.215
Top left corner.

01:32:30.895 --> 01:32:33.335
Me 'ands are dirty.

01:32:34.175 --> 01:32:35.973
That's no matter. These are...

01:32:35.975 --> 01:32:37.535
...notes for myself alone.

01:32:42.495 --> 01:32:44.614
Will I be in t'picture?

01:32:46.775 --> 01:32:49.614
Nay, lass,
thou'll't not be in t'picture.

01:32:52.575 --> 01:32:55.213
Bessie!
Leave t'gentleman alone!

01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:58.373
The young lady is providing me
with assistance, Mrs Johnson.

01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:00.815
Oh, I beg pardon, Mr Hunt.

01:33:18.895 --> 01:33:21.373
Understand this, I care not.

01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:24.495
I will not be paraded like
some beast in a menagerie.

01:33:29.414 --> 01:33:30.933
Can I not get thee a drink,
Sam?

01:33:30.935 --> 01:33:33.294
No, thank you, my dear.

01:33:35.654 --> 01:33:36.735
Who is that?

01:33:38.255 --> 01:33:39.853
It's Mr Hunt.

01:33:39.855 --> 01:33:42.175
Oh, yes.

01:33:44.614 --> 01:33:45.575
Sam.

01:33:46.294 --> 01:33:49.412
May I ask what thee would like
to speak to Mr Hunt regarding?

01:33:49.414 --> 01:33:52.373
What I would like to speak
to Mr Hunt regarding, Joe...

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:54.213
I would like to speak
to Mr Hunt regarding.

01:33:54.215 --> 01:33:56.973
Aye.
Well, it would appear Mr Hunt

01:33:56.975 --> 01:33:59.375
is otherwise occupied
at present.

01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:04.533
Oh. Well, we all have matters
that need attending to, Joe.

01:34:04.535 --> 01:34:07.013
And I'm sure Mr Hunt
can spare a few moments

01:34:07.015 --> 01:34:09.095
to speak to a fellow reformer.

01:34:15.735 --> 01:34:17.893
- Mr Bamford.
- Mr Hunt.

01:34:17.895 --> 01:34:19.895
What is it of such import that
it cannot wait till Monday?

01:34:20.775 --> 01:34:23.813
How are you going on
at our end o' t'country, sir?

01:34:23.815 --> 01:34:26.733
Sadly, I have been immured
within these four walls

01:34:26.735 --> 01:34:28.813
this past week.

01:34:28.815 --> 01:34:30.693
Though I am grateful to
the kind hospitality

01:34:30.695 --> 01:34:33.015
- of these good people.
- Aye, I'm glad to hear it.

01:34:33.855 --> 01:34:35.933
They are indeed good people.

01:34:35.935 --> 01:34:39.333
Now, speaking o' t'meeting
a-Monday,

01:34:39.335 --> 01:34:43.333
we've been drilling t'lads in
ranks for nigh on a month now,

01:34:43.335 --> 01:34:45.893
and we have a thousand men
moving together

01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:47.693
as if it were a mere score,
sir.

01:34:47.695 --> 01:34:49.893
I am heartened to hear it,
Mr Bamford.

01:34:49.895 --> 01:34:52.013
I am told that we are
to anticipate a mighty crowd.

01:34:52.015 --> 01:34:53.493
Aye.

01:34:53.495 --> 01:34:56.493
Aye, we are that, sir.
And we shall do thee proud.

01:34:56.495 --> 01:34:59.093
Now, we have been
instilling into t'lads

01:34:59.095 --> 01:35:02.933
the principles of cleanliness,
sobriety, order,

01:35:02.935 --> 01:35:05.612
and also t'notion of peace,
which I believe

01:35:05.614 --> 01:35:07.933
were your own personal addage
to t'list, sir,

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:09.455
and one
which I respect greatly.

01:35:10.335 --> 01:35:14.093
Now, these ideas have been
taken to heart by all t'lads

01:35:14.095 --> 01:35:16.933
and have been carried well
throughout all t'ranks, sir.

01:35:16.935 --> 01:35:19.733
I look forward to seeing it
with mine own eyes, Mr Bamford.

01:35:19.735 --> 01:35:20.935
I'm sure they'll do you proud.

01:35:21.695 --> 01:35:23.695
Now, on that subject, sir...

01:35:25.294 --> 01:35:27.813
..would it not be prudent of us

01:35:27.815 --> 01:35:30.853
to have
a small contingent of men -

01:35:30.855 --> 01:35:35.015
say a score or two
amongst a thousand -

01:35:36.215 --> 01:35:39.052
armed with cudgels
just to protect...

01:35:39.054 --> 01:35:41.013
Mr Johnson, will you show
Mr Bamford the door?

01:35:41.015 --> 01:35:44.333
Mr Hunt, I have come here
to speak man to man

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:45.733
about an important matter.

01:35:45.735 --> 01:35:49.573
Then let me speak to you
man to man, Mr Bamford.

01:35:49.575 --> 01:35:53.333
If any man is armed with
so much as a stone on Monday,

01:35:53.335 --> 01:35:55.935
there will be no meeting
at which I will speak.

01:35:56.815 --> 01:35:59.933
There are a large body of men
signed up at Manchester.

01:35:59.935 --> 01:36:02.054
And women and children.

01:36:02.815 --> 01:36:04.973
And it is them
that I seek to protect.

01:36:04.975 --> 01:36:09.013
I am speaking of t'Manchester
and Salford Yeomanry, sir.

01:36:09.015 --> 01:36:11.412
A large body of men are signed up,

01:36:11.414 --> 01:36:13.973
and weapons have been widely
distributed amongst them.

01:36:13.975 --> 01:36:16.052
And it is precisely
for that reason

01:36:16.054 --> 01:36:17.893
that we must give them
no provocation.

01:36:17.895 --> 01:36:20.052
But these are men
who are not only

01:36:20.054 --> 01:36:22.292
politically averse
to our cause, sir,

01:36:22.294 --> 01:36:24.292
but also personally
averse to us.

01:36:24.294 --> 01:36:26.453
- Mr Bamford...
- Are we to lead our young'uns

01:36:26.455 --> 01:36:28.533
and our wives
and our sweethearts

01:36:28.535 --> 01:36:30.373
into the mouth
of such a threat,

01:36:30.375 --> 01:36:31.853
wi'out t'means
of defending them?

01:36:31.855 --> 01:36:34.575
Mr Bamford,
I understand your fears.

01:36:35.895 --> 01:36:37.973
But you have not been
to a mass meeting

01:36:37.975 --> 01:36:40.373
as this promises to be.
I have.

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:42.573
I have spoken
at meetings in London

01:36:42.575 --> 01:36:45.292
of over one hundred
thousand people,

01:36:45.294 --> 01:36:46.733
and at those meetings

01:36:46.735 --> 01:36:50.733
not one blade of grass,
not a gust of wind,

01:36:50.735 --> 01:36:53.893
has been the recipient
of a single act of violence.

01:36:53.895 --> 01:36:56.693
Had they been, the authorities
would have taken it

01:36:56.695 --> 01:36:59.373
as permission to break up
not only the meeting,

01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:01.333
but the entire movement.

01:37:01.335 --> 01:37:04.573
I will not have my reputation
and name,

01:37:04.575 --> 01:37:06.733
and the virtues
which I espouse,

01:37:06.735 --> 01:37:10.093
besmirched for the behaviour
of a single group of men...

01:37:10.095 --> 01:37:12.093
But this is Lancashire, sir,

01:37:12.095 --> 01:37:13.973
and the authorities here
have no regard

01:37:13.975 --> 01:37:16.493
for thy reputation
or anybody else's.

01:37:16.495 --> 01:37:19.093
And meetings of this nature,
hereabouts,

01:37:19.095 --> 01:37:20.773
invariably end in violence.

01:37:20.775 --> 01:37:22.975
That is because they have not
been addressed by me.

01:37:24.815 --> 01:37:26.733
Dost thy have children
of thine own, sir?

01:37:26.735 --> 01:37:28.095
I do, sir.

01:37:29.015 --> 01:37:31.013
And would thee lead
thy children

01:37:31.015 --> 01:37:33.292
into danger such as this?

01:37:33.294 --> 01:37:36.253
I would gladly lead my children
by the hand,

01:37:36.255 --> 01:37:38.253
with a song in my heart,

01:37:38.255 --> 01:37:40.855
to any meeting
chaired by Henry Hunt.

01:37:43.815 --> 01:37:48.015
Uh-huh. Well, I am
hardly satisfied by that.

01:37:49.495 --> 01:37:54.052
But as this is a committee
decision not to bear arms,

01:37:54.054 --> 01:37:57.495
then I suppose I am
duty bound to carry it.

01:37:58.855 --> 01:38:01.173
But I shall pray to God

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.493
that He might afford
some protection

01:38:03.495 --> 01:38:05.375
to our vulnerable folk.

01:38:11.175 --> 01:38:13.453
I shall see thee a-Monday, sir,

01:38:13.455 --> 01:38:15.173
and let us hope it is a day...

01:38:15.175 --> 01:38:16.853
we need not look back on
with regret.

01:38:16.855 --> 01:38:18.813
Let us hope that, both.

01:38:18.815 --> 01:38:20.773
Aye.

01:38:20.775 --> 01:38:22.533
Good day.

01:38:22.535 --> 01:38:24.493
Joseph.

01:38:24.495 --> 01:38:26.294
Mrs Johnson.

01:38:28.575 --> 01:38:31.213
I do apologise, Mr Hunt.

01:38:31.215 --> 01:38:34.215
I want him watched
from now until Monday.

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:37.652
There will be no violence.

01:38:37.654 --> 01:38:39.493
I shall see to it.

01:38:39.495 --> 01:38:42.175
There are to be no weapons.
Rest assured.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.775
Let us continue our supper.

01:38:50.335 --> 01:38:52.652
Oh, it will have gone cold,
Mr Hunt.

01:38:52.654 --> 01:38:54.695
It's no matter, Mrs Johnson.

01:38:59.255 --> 01:39:00.533
Gentlemen, I hope
you may permit me

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:02.453
to dispense with the formalities.

01:39:02.455 --> 01:39:05.733
We neither need nor desire
introductions, Mr Hunt.

01:39:05.735 --> 01:39:07.893
Indeed not.

01:39:07.895 --> 01:39:10.052
Well, then, let me ask plainly.

01:39:10.054 --> 01:39:13.813
Is there, as I've been led
to believe that there is,

01:39:13.815 --> 01:39:15.815
a charge against my name?

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:21.013
I suggest you may be a victim
of false information, Mr Hunt.

01:39:21.015 --> 01:39:23.095
There is presently
no such charge.

01:39:25.215 --> 01:39:27.253
There is no such charge
at present?

01:39:27.255 --> 01:39:28.973
- No, sir.
- Would that there were,

01:39:28.975 --> 01:39:30.695
Mr Hunt.

01:39:31.535 --> 01:39:33.253
Well, sir, should there be,

01:39:33.255 --> 01:39:37.693
let me avow that I would
freely and without hesitation,

01:39:37.695 --> 01:39:39.895
offer myself up for arrest.

01:39:42.015 --> 01:39:44.335
I seek no subterfuge
here in Manchester.

01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:47.535
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:39:49.575 --> 01:39:51.775
You remain at liberty, Mr Hunt,

01:39:52.735 --> 01:39:54.773
but I might remind you

01:39:54.775 --> 01:39:57.533
that we retain the full
and unwavering support

01:39:57.535 --> 01:40:00.175
of His Majesty's Government
and military force.

01:40:00.695 --> 01:40:02.855
As I, sir, retain the support
of the people.

01:40:04.294 --> 01:40:07.054
You, sir, are a blaggard!

01:40:16.695 --> 01:40:17.975
Buffoon.

01:40:18.855 --> 01:40:21.333
He should be clapped in irons.

01:40:21.335 --> 01:40:23.292
It takes but a matter of moments

01:40:23.294 --> 01:40:25.695
to inscribe a man's name on a warrant.

01:40:35.175 --> 01:40:38.173
- Good evening.
- Good evening, madam, sir.

01:40:38.175 --> 01:40:39.893
I am seeking Mr Henry Hunt.

01:40:39.895 --> 01:40:42.573
I was told he would be
at this address at this hour.

01:40:42.575 --> 01:40:44.052
And you are?

01:40:44.054 --> 01:40:46.853
Richard Carlile of Sherwin's
Political Register, London.

01:40:46.855 --> 01:40:49.573
Mr Carlile! Joseph Johnson
of the Manchester Observer.

01:40:49.575 --> 01:40:51.573
Mr Johnson.

01:40:51.575 --> 01:40:53.333
- Oh, do come in.
- Thank you.

01:40:55.215 --> 01:40:57.533
- Ah, Henry!
- Richard.

01:40:57.535 --> 01:40:59.733
What do you here in Manchester?

01:40:59.735 --> 01:41:01.213
Why, I... I am here to attend

01:41:01.215 --> 01:41:03.453
tomorrow's great assembly,
naturally.

01:41:03.455 --> 01:41:05.773
But at whose invitation?

01:41:05.775 --> 01:41:08.652
Why, that of Mr Wroe and...
and Mr Knight

01:41:08.654 --> 01:41:10.815
of the Manchester Observer.

01:41:11.535 --> 01:41:13.573
And why was I
not informed of this?

01:41:13.575 --> 01:41:15.175
Well, I...

01:41:15.895 --> 01:41:19.375
I have prepared some words
to address the multitude.

01:41:21.294 --> 01:41:22.933
Richard, I'm afraid
we have agreed

01:41:22.935 --> 01:41:24.533
that the number
of speakers tomorrow

01:41:24.535 --> 01:41:26.255
will be kept to a minimum.

01:41:27.455 --> 01:41:30.853
Henry, I have brought with me
one hundred impressions

01:41:30.855 --> 01:41:33.453
of your exemplary
Smithfield speech

01:41:33.455 --> 01:41:37.054
on civil and universal liberty,
to distribute tomorrow.

01:41:38.455 --> 01:41:40.973
This was last month. I do not
intend to repeat myself.

01:41:40.975 --> 01:41:43.533
The people of these parts
must know

01:41:43.535 --> 01:41:45.612
that reform
is not merely a matter

01:41:45.614 --> 01:41:47.813
of achieving
universal suffrage,

01:41:47.815 --> 01:41:50.292
but... but of freedom from
the tyranny of the Church

01:41:50.294 --> 01:41:52.292
and of the destruction
of monarchy.

01:41:52.294 --> 01:41:53.733
Richard, in Manchester,

01:41:53.735 --> 01:41:55.893
universal suffrage
is the sole message.

01:41:55.895 --> 01:41:57.375
That alone.

01:41:58.695 --> 01:42:00.695
I thank you for your pains.

01:42:03.294 --> 01:42:06.733
Henry, what consideration
have you given

01:42:06.735 --> 01:42:09.292
to the possibility of violence
tomorrow?

01:42:09.294 --> 01:42:10.493
I fear it greatly.

01:42:10.495 --> 01:42:13.333
Richard, firstly you advise me
how to speak.

01:42:13.335 --> 01:42:15.453
Now you advise me
how to behave.

01:42:15.455 --> 01:42:19.414
I feel your interventions are
both excessive and unnecessary.

01:42:26.095 --> 01:42:30.175
Well, perhaps you will allow me
to travel with you tomorrow?

01:42:32.575 --> 01:42:34.733
Mr Johnson, might there
be room in the barouche?

01:42:34.735 --> 01:42:36.975
Aye, I should think so,
Mr Hunt.

01:42:38.535 --> 01:42:40.095
Well, then, yes, you must.

01:42:41.095 --> 01:42:42.855
You'll be my guest.

01:42:43.695 --> 01:42:45.733
I thank you.

01:42:45.735 --> 01:42:47.815
Our chains are shaking, Henry.

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:50.933
They will be broken.

01:42:50.935 --> 01:42:53.573
I will take my leave.
Good evening.

01:42:53.575 --> 01:42:55.614
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

01:43:00.175 --> 01:43:02.093
I must apologise for
the continued interruptions,

01:43:02.095 --> 01:43:03.933
- Mrs Johnson.
- Oh.

01:43:03.935 --> 01:43:05.333
I can assure you, come Tuesday,

01:43:05.335 --> 01:43:07.654
your lives
will return to normalcy.

01:43:09.975 --> 01:43:11.654
Go home, Bessie.

01:43:12.775 --> 01:43:14.773
Yes, Mrs Johnson.

01:43:14.775 --> 01:43:16.935
Good night, Mr Johnson.

01:43:38.535 --> 01:43:40.375
- Y'a'right?
- Aye.

01:43:40.895 --> 01:43:43.893
- The heat's knocked her out.
- Ooh... It's too warm.

01:43:43.895 --> 01:43:44.933
Aye.

01:43:44.935 --> 01:43:48.533
- I'll not sleep tonight.
- It might cool down later on.

01:43:48.535 --> 01:43:49.495
Aye.

01:43:52.935 --> 01:43:54.693
- Night.
- Good night, love.

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.695
Night, Father.

01:44:04.294 --> 01:44:06.493
You a'right for tomorrow?

01:44:06.495 --> 01:44:08.935
Aye, I reckon so.

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.733
It'll be a good day, Mother.

01:44:15.735 --> 01:44:17.935
Aye, it will.

01:44:19.535 --> 01:44:20.935
Night.

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:23.495
Night, love.

01:44:27.215 --> 01:44:28.693
You a'right?

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.255
Aye.

01:44:33.215 --> 01:44:35.093
Look at her.

01:44:35.095 --> 01:44:37.495
- Little angel.
- Mmm.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:44.455
I were just thinking, in 1900,
she'll be eighty five.

01:44:45.495 --> 01:44:48.375
- Will she?
- Aye, of course she will.

01:44:50.535 --> 01:44:53.213
She'll be a great-grandma.

01:44:53.215 --> 01:44:55.935
- Wishing her life away!
- Oh, I'm just saying.

01:45:00.054 --> 01:45:02.294
I hope it's a better world for her.

01:45:03.095 --> 01:45:04.893
Summat'll get better.

01:45:04.895 --> 01:45:07.175
Some things'll never change.

01:45:08.215 --> 01:45:11.093
They say there'll be
a lot of folk there tomorrow,

01:45:11.095 --> 01:45:13.813
waving their flags,
banging their drums.

01:45:13.815 --> 01:45:15.855
I hope so.

01:45:19.414 --> 01:45:21.533
Good night, Mother.

01:45:21.535 --> 01:45:23.015
Night, Father.

01:46:18.175 --> 01:46:20.612
Right, we've got five lads
in t'front row...

01:46:20.614 --> 01:46:23.695
Absolutely right.
Right, women in rows of five!

01:46:24.695 --> 01:46:27.013
Come on, you girls!

01:46:27.015 --> 01:46:29.693
Rows of five.
Sort yourselves out.

01:46:29.695 --> 01:46:32.054
- Now, then...
- Right.

01:46:34.255 --> 01:46:37.175
Who's got t'banner here?
That end. That's it, lads.

01:46:37.815 --> 01:46:39.614
You lads at t'end there.

01:46:40.735 --> 01:46:42.175
Hey, now.

01:46:43.175 --> 01:46:45.693
Keep in rank and file right, lads.

01:46:45.695 --> 01:46:47.855
Keep to the right.

01:46:51.935 --> 01:46:54.054
- Mary.
- Right, let's have a look.

01:47:00.294 --> 01:47:01.815
Now, then.

01:47:02.775 --> 01:47:04.935
The meeting we are going to today...

01:47:05.614 --> 01:47:08.733
is t'biggest
and t'most important meeting

01:47:08.735 --> 01:47:10.855
about parliamentary reform
we've ever had.

01:47:11.935 --> 01:47:14.733
So, lads, stay in your ranks!

01:47:14.735 --> 01:47:20.215
The more calmness
and sensibility we show now,

01:47:21.015 --> 01:47:24.493
the more we make liars
of our enemies,

01:47:24.495 --> 01:47:26.052
who have represented us

01:47:26.054 --> 01:47:29.333
as a mob and a rabble
these past few years.

01:47:29.335 --> 01:47:32.652
And let's shame them
with our good conduct.

01:47:34.255 --> 01:47:36.652
Now, what we are
going to town for today,

01:47:36.654 --> 01:47:38.695
we're not going to beg
or plead...

01:47:39.414 --> 01:47:43.253
..because what we want,
it's not theirs to give!

01:47:44.735 --> 01:47:48.493
It were given to us by God,
on t'day of our birth,

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:50.213
as honest Englishmen.

01:47:50.215 --> 01:47:52.493
And with that in mind,

01:47:52.495 --> 01:47:55.493
no weapons must be allowed
on t'march

01:47:55.495 --> 01:47:57.013
as agreed by t'committee.

01:47:57.015 --> 01:48:00.493
So come on, lads, drop
the sticks, drop your clubs.

01:48:01.614 --> 01:48:03.853
Drop your knives
and your cudgels.

01:48:03.855 --> 01:48:06.173
There's no need
for violence here.

01:48:07.375 --> 01:48:08.895
That's it, boys.

01:48:11.815 --> 01:48:13.813
Now, then.

01:48:13.815 --> 01:48:18.213
First stop, will be Sam Ogden's
taphouse in Harpurhey...

01:48:20.294 --> 01:48:23.292
And then on to Manchester...

01:48:25.255 --> 01:48:26.733
..and liberty!

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:30.652
Left foot forward, lads!

01:48:30.654 --> 01:48:32.173
Left!

01:48:32.175 --> 01:48:33.495
Left!

01:48:33.895 --> 01:48:35.253
Left!

01:48:35.255 --> 01:48:36.495
Left!

01:49:04.535 --> 01:49:06.294
Come on - get on with it.

01:49:10.495 --> 01:49:12.813
Get a move on.
There's stones all over here.

01:49:12.815 --> 01:49:15.375
Get 'em on the back
of this cart, and quick!

01:49:52.935 --> 01:49:54.495
Scum.

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:58.453
- That's what they are. Scum.
- Aye, they are that, sir.

01:49:58.455 --> 01:50:01.893
I put food on their table
and this is how they repay me.

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:03.695
They've got no right, sir.

01:50:16.935 --> 01:50:18.652
- Are we all ready?
- Aye, Nellie.

01:50:18.654 --> 01:50:19.893
Aye.

01:50:19.895 --> 01:50:21.612
Reet, come on!

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:22.775
Aye.

01:50:24.215 --> 01:50:26.414
- Morning, Eli!
- Morning, Nellie.

01:50:30.054 --> 01:50:32.052
- Looking forward to it?
- Yes.

01:50:32.054 --> 01:50:33.614
- All right, lad?
- Aye.

01:50:35.414 --> 01:50:37.175
Morning.

01:51:00.175 --> 01:51:03.573
- Liberty or death.
- Annual parliaments!

01:51:03.575 --> 01:51:05.453
No taxation without
representation!

01:51:05.455 --> 01:51:07.373
Vote by ballot!

01:51:07.375 --> 01:51:09.973
- No Corn Laws!
- Universal suffrage!

01:51:09.975 --> 01:51:12.773
- Get back to your husbands!
- Shame!

01:51:12.775 --> 01:51:15.013
Whores! Harlots!

01:51:15.015 --> 01:51:17.853
Hussies!
Go home to your babies!

01:51:17.855 --> 01:51:21.935
- It'll achieve nowt.
- Friends, unite and be free!

01:51:31.375 --> 01:51:33.933
Gentlemen,
for King and Country!

01:51:33.935 --> 01:51:37.294
- Aye, sir. King and Country.
- King and Country!

01:51:38.895 --> 01:51:41.093
To King and Country!

01:51:41.095 --> 01:51:43.335
To King and Country!

01:51:44.654 --> 01:51:48.652
- And again!
- To King and Country!

01:51:48.654 --> 01:51:51.213
And again!

01:51:51.215 --> 01:51:54.575
To King and Country!

01:51:59.815 --> 01:52:01.453
..give them a bit of justice!

01:52:01.455 --> 01:52:03.535
Liberty!

01:52:15.015 --> 01:52:16.495
Liberty!

01:52:24.654 --> 01:52:26.215
Liberty!

01:52:48.654 --> 01:52:50.654
You wait till you get
to the field.

01:53:09.175 --> 01:53:10.455
Mr Norris, how do you do?

01:53:11.375 --> 01:53:13.412
- Look at them.
- It is without precedent.

01:53:13.414 --> 01:53:15.373
Is the room in readiness?

01:53:15.375 --> 01:53:17.495
- Aye, it is.
- Very good.

01:53:19.175 --> 01:53:21.973
I sent my man here earlier
with some wine. Is it...

01:53:21.975 --> 01:53:24.453
- Aye, sir, it's over there.
- Excellent.

01:53:24.455 --> 01:53:26.375
- Could I have a word?
- Of course.

01:53:27.575 --> 01:53:29.973
I don't know what's going
to happen this afternoon.

01:53:41.735 --> 01:53:46.533
Mr Buxton, would you
kindly remove that... sheet?

01:53:46.535 --> 01:53:47.853
Certainly, sir.

01:53:47.855 --> 01:53:49.893
Gentlemen,
should you need refreshment,

01:53:49.895 --> 01:53:51.493
we have some fine claret here,

01:53:51.495 --> 01:53:53.253
if you wish
to avail yourselves.

01:53:57.015 --> 01:54:00.535
Gentlemen, I wish you well
with your business today.

01:54:01.294 --> 01:54:04.052
If nature calls,
there's a pot in t'corner.

01:54:04.054 --> 01:54:06.735
- Good day, sir.
- Thank you, very much.

01:54:19.855 --> 01:54:21.412
What's going on now?

01:54:21.414 --> 01:54:23.853
I don't know.
We're just waiting.

01:54:23.855 --> 01:54:24.973
How long have you
been waiting for?

01:54:24.975 --> 01:54:27.052
Ah, not long.

01:54:27.054 --> 01:54:29.453
- Have you come far?
- Chadderton.

01:54:29.455 --> 01:54:31.893
- That's Oldham way, in't it?
- Aye.

01:54:31.895 --> 01:54:34.052
- That's a fair way.
- Aye, it is.

01:54:34.054 --> 01:54:35.493
Too far.

01:54:35.495 --> 01:54:38.052
Father, what are you doing now?

01:54:38.054 --> 01:54:39.652
Where you going?

01:54:39.654 --> 01:54:41.933
- Has he had enough?
- He's got to walk back yet.

01:54:41.935 --> 01:54:44.375
- How far is it?
- Nine mile.

01:54:45.775 --> 01:54:48.015
- See thee.
- Aye, see thee.

01:54:49.735 --> 01:54:51.253
Colonel Fletcher,

01:54:51.255 --> 01:54:53.652
just where are the Manchester
and Salford Yeomanry?

01:54:53.654 --> 01:54:56.052
They stand hard by
in Portland Street.

01:54:56.054 --> 01:54:57.412
They await my orders.

01:54:57.414 --> 01:54:59.733
We should
summon them immediately.

01:54:59.735 --> 01:55:01.773
Once the crowd see them,
they shall disperse.

01:55:01.775 --> 01:55:04.253
In my view, that would be
the wrong course of action.

01:55:04.255 --> 01:55:06.373
We should arrest Hunt
before he arrives.

01:55:06.375 --> 01:55:09.373
Send in the troops
and spirit him away somewhere.

01:55:09.375 --> 01:55:11.733
These people
are in a good mood.

01:55:11.735 --> 01:55:13.652
The men have
brought their wives

01:55:13.654 --> 01:55:15.253
and their children with them.

01:55:15.255 --> 01:55:17.773
In the presence of women,
men behave better.

01:55:17.775 --> 01:55:21.573
Men, women, wives, children,
I care not!

01:55:21.575 --> 01:55:23.573
We are their moral superiors.

01:55:23.575 --> 01:55:25.933
It is our Christian duty

01:55:25.935 --> 01:55:28.373
to bring the axe down
on this riotous mob!

01:55:28.375 --> 01:55:29.733
Well said, sir! Well said!

01:55:29.735 --> 01:55:32.052
They are not mere animals,
Mallory.

01:55:32.054 --> 01:55:34.773
They are honest, gullible folk.

01:55:34.775 --> 01:55:36.453
I agree with Mr Warmley.

01:55:36.455 --> 01:55:38.412
Arrest Hunt
before he arrives in the field.

01:55:38.414 --> 01:55:40.612
You silence the man today

01:55:40.614 --> 01:55:42.373
and he'll be rousing
another rabble

01:55:42.375 --> 01:55:44.493
- before the fortnight's out!
- Absolutely!

01:55:44.495 --> 01:55:47.292
We must give him
just sufficient rope

01:55:47.294 --> 01:55:49.292
for him to hang himself.

01:55:49.294 --> 01:55:50.973
We are in charge, gentlemen,

01:55:50.975 --> 01:55:53.612
and we must be seen
to be in charge, and not Hunt.

01:55:53.614 --> 01:55:56.333
- Hear, hear!
- I am not disputing that, sir.

01:55:56.335 --> 01:55:59.652
If I might advise you,
from a legal standpoint,

01:55:59.654 --> 01:56:03.493
it is essential that the true
character of that assembly

01:56:03.495 --> 01:56:06.173
be allowed to reveal itself.

01:56:06.175 --> 01:56:09.052
"One man, one vote"!
"Parliamentary Representation"!

01:56:09.054 --> 01:56:10.292
Outrageous.

01:56:10.294 --> 01:56:12.853
- Preposterous propositions!
- Sedition!

01:56:12.855 --> 01:56:14.773
We must allow Hunt to speak,

01:56:14.775 --> 01:56:17.213
so that he be seen
to be inciting

01:56:17.215 --> 01:56:20.253
a gullible mass of people
to riot.

01:56:20.255 --> 01:56:23.652
Then we may act
with promptitude and vigour.

01:56:23.654 --> 01:56:27.052
We must read the Riot Act
and we must do so immediately.

01:56:27.054 --> 01:56:28.292
I second that!

01:56:28.294 --> 01:56:30.333
Prepare ourselves legally
to clear the field.

01:56:30.335 --> 01:56:32.973
I have the Riot Act here,

01:56:32.975 --> 01:56:35.533
and they shall hear my voice

01:56:35.535 --> 01:56:38.933
and there shall be one fold
and one shepherd!

01:56:38.935 --> 01:56:41.775
We find you in glad spirits.

01:56:42.414 --> 01:56:44.773
We shall maintain our spirits.

01:56:56.695 --> 01:56:59.335
Primarily our function
is to observe.

01:57:00.294 --> 01:57:02.253
Secondly, we must expedite

01:57:02.255 --> 01:57:05.013
the express directives
of the Home Office,

01:57:05.015 --> 01:57:07.853
which are namely to allow
the meeting to take place...

01:57:07.855 --> 01:57:10.533
It is an illegal meeting!

01:57:10.535 --> 01:57:13.654
- But, is it?
- It is not illegal, gentlemen.

01:57:14.455 --> 01:57:16.533
We must let Hunt speak

01:57:16.535 --> 01:57:18.213
and then only seek to intervene

01:57:18.215 --> 01:57:20.412
should the crowd
then move to riot.

01:57:20.414 --> 01:57:22.612
So is there a level
of bloodletting

01:57:22.614 --> 01:57:24.652
which you find acceptable,
Mr Norris?

01:57:24.654 --> 01:57:29.373
Gentlemen, may I remind you
that today is not the Sabbath.

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:32.412
It is a Monday,
and Monday is a working day

01:57:32.414 --> 01:57:35.292
and these idlers and sluggards
should be at their toil.

01:57:35.294 --> 01:57:37.052
Aye, and what are
they up to instead?

01:57:37.054 --> 01:57:40.773
The gates of hell are open
night and day.

01:57:40.775 --> 01:57:43.893
Smooth the descent
and easy is the way.

01:57:43.895 --> 01:57:45.773
Have you any idea

01:57:45.775 --> 01:57:48.052
how the introduction
of the mechanical loom

01:57:48.054 --> 01:57:49.973
has changed the life
of this town?

01:57:49.975 --> 01:57:52.493
- I have, sir.
- Then why not stay silent?

01:57:52.495 --> 01:57:54.573
Then why not join the mob, sir?

01:57:54.575 --> 01:57:58.813
- The mechanical loom...
- All this is prevarication!

01:57:58.815 --> 01:58:00.735
Mr Hunt!

01:58:03.975 --> 01:58:05.533
Mr Hunt!

01:58:05.535 --> 01:58:07.173
John Tyas, the London Times.

01:58:07.175 --> 01:58:09.052
- Tyas?
- Mr Tyas?

01:58:09.054 --> 01:58:11.693
I wonder if you might admit me
onto the hustings.

01:58:11.695 --> 01:58:14.373
For what purpose? To spread
more of your falsehoods?

01:58:14.375 --> 01:58:16.015
Not at all, sir.

01:58:17.735 --> 01:58:20.695
- Keep close.
- Much obliged, Mr Hunt.

01:58:21.975 --> 01:58:24.335
Gentlemen.

01:58:33.175 --> 01:58:36.054
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

01:58:37.654 --> 01:58:42.054
Gentlemen, you have
many strong... opinions.

01:58:42.855 --> 01:58:45.652
But if I may,
speaking as the chairman

01:58:45.654 --> 01:58:48.775
for this special committee
of magistrates...

01:58:49.414 --> 01:58:51.294
Beg pardon, Mr Hulton.

01:58:52.054 --> 01:58:55.052
- Did you say the chairman?
- Indeed I did, sir.

01:58:55.054 --> 01:58:57.173
- But you're not the chairman.
- I am the chairman.

01:58:57.175 --> 01:58:59.253
I am the chairman.

01:58:59.255 --> 01:59:00.614
You are mistaken, sir.

01:59:01.495 --> 01:59:02.735
I am to take the chair.

01:59:03.294 --> 01:59:04.733
Upon whose authority?

01:59:04.735 --> 01:59:08.493
Upon the authority, sir, of the
Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire.

01:59:08.495 --> 01:59:11.093
- Give way, sir!
- Mr Norris, sir, stand down!

01:59:11.095 --> 01:59:12.773
- Stand down!
- It is settled.

01:59:12.775 --> 01:59:14.654
May we proceed?

01:59:16.455 --> 01:59:19.015
I suppose you may, Mr Hulton.

01:59:26.215 --> 01:59:27.895
Move back!

01:59:29.335 --> 01:59:32.292
Move back! Move back!

01:59:32.294 --> 01:59:34.373
Back! Back!

01:59:34.375 --> 01:59:36.333
Move them back!

01:59:58.414 --> 02:00:00.054
Oh.

02:00:25.495 --> 02:00:27.493
Get back!

02:00:42.294 --> 02:00:44.614
Universal suffrage!

02:00:45.654 --> 02:00:47.815
Votes by ballot!

02:01:06.654 --> 02:01:08.373
The white hat, there. Look.

02:01:09.575 --> 02:01:12.733
- That's him, sir.
- And the women.

02:01:14.815 --> 02:01:17.493
- Votes by ballot!
- Can you see?

02:01:17.495 --> 02:01:19.813
Give them a wave!
Give them a wave!

02:01:19.815 --> 02:01:22.215
Unite and be free!

02:01:23.054 --> 02:01:25.095
Hunt and liberty!

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:38.054
How do? How do?

02:01:41.735 --> 02:01:43.052
Gentlemen.

02:01:43.054 --> 02:01:46.813
Gentlemen, what are your
intentions regarding that mob?

02:01:46.815 --> 02:01:48.213
To whom am I speaking?

02:01:48.215 --> 02:01:51.253
Oh, you know very well
to whom you are speaking, sir.

02:01:51.255 --> 02:01:52.813
- I do not.
- We, sir,

02:01:52.815 --> 02:01:55.573
are in fear for our persons
and our property!

02:01:55.575 --> 02:01:57.333
- Aye.
- Not to mention our lives!

02:01:57.335 --> 02:01:59.013
I can sympathise
with your fears,

02:01:59.015 --> 02:02:00.773
and I may share your concerns,

02:02:00.775 --> 02:02:02.693
but I will not tolerate
your behaviour!

02:02:02.695 --> 02:02:04.013
Our men are in readiness

02:02:04.015 --> 02:02:06.213
and they will be dispatched
in due course.

02:02:06.215 --> 02:02:08.893
You have your
Manchester and Salford Yeomanry

02:02:08.895 --> 02:02:11.973
- at your disposal.
- And His Majesty's forces!

02:02:11.975 --> 02:02:14.773
- Use them!
- We are the law, sir.

02:02:14.775 --> 02:02:16.973
And we will use them
when we see fit!

02:02:16.975 --> 02:02:17.893
Pah!

02:03:09.294 --> 02:03:11.052
Hunt forever!

02:03:22.735 --> 02:03:24.612
- She's unwell.
- She's fainted.

02:03:24.614 --> 02:03:26.813
Bring her into the carriage.

02:03:26.815 --> 02:03:28.294
Thank you.

02:03:30.895 --> 02:03:32.412
Thank you, Mr Knight.

02:03:57.775 --> 02:03:59.975
Oh, what a splendid multitude,
Henry.

02:04:01.895 --> 02:04:03.695
Universal liberty!

02:04:13.575 --> 02:04:16.453
I have never before seen
such a great multitude.

02:04:16.455 --> 02:04:18.453
Aye. This is the day, John.

02:04:18.455 --> 02:04:20.575
- Go on, Mary. Go on!
- Yes, take your hat off.

02:04:22.775 --> 02:04:25.015
- Go on.
- And your frock.

02:04:29.015 --> 02:04:32.052
- Universal liberty!
- As I promised, Mr Hunt,

02:04:32.054 --> 02:04:35.412
the largest assemblage
ever seen in Manchester!

02:04:35.414 --> 02:04:38.292
Alas, with the wind as it is,
it might have been better

02:04:38.294 --> 02:04:41.292
had the hustings been
positioned in the far corner.

02:04:41.294 --> 02:04:44.495
I was given assurance that this
was the best position, Mr Hunt.

02:04:45.375 --> 02:04:47.292
It is no matter.

02:04:47.294 --> 02:04:49.335
I've succeeded with worse.

02:04:55.614 --> 02:04:56.773
How are you finding Manchester?

02:04:56.775 --> 02:04:59.292
Oh, I'm very fond of it,
thank you, Mrs Saxton.

02:04:59.294 --> 02:05:01.855
The first of many trips north
in the interests of reform.

02:05:03.775 --> 02:05:04.614
Sir?

02:05:07.054 --> 02:05:08.853
Edward Baines, Leeds Mercury.

02:05:08.855 --> 02:05:10.493
Ah, Mr Baines.

02:05:10.495 --> 02:05:12.612
Please join us. You are welcome.

02:05:12.614 --> 02:05:13.773
Thank you, sir.

02:05:13.775 --> 02:05:16.813
- Which paper?
- The Leeds Mercury.

02:05:16.815 --> 02:05:18.614
Ghastly rag.

02:05:21.015 --> 02:05:22.933
John Tyas of the London Times.

02:05:22.935 --> 02:05:25.493
- All the way from London?
- Hmm. And you are, madam?

02:05:25.495 --> 02:05:26.733
Susanna Saxton

02:05:26.735 --> 02:05:28.893
of the Manchester
Female Reform Society.

02:05:28.895 --> 02:05:32.015
I do hope you will represent us
favourably, Mr Tyas.

02:05:33.175 --> 02:05:35.493
- Mr Knight.
- Is that Mr Smith?

02:05:35.495 --> 02:05:37.292
- Who's that?
- Ah, Mr Saxton.

02:05:37.294 --> 02:05:39.253
- Welcome, Smith.
- Mr Wroe.

02:05:39.255 --> 02:05:41.412
I was informed
you were not able to attend.

02:05:41.414 --> 02:05:44.013
Oh, I shouldn't have
missed this for the world, sir.

02:05:44.015 --> 02:05:46.054
Look at the people!

02:05:48.495 --> 02:05:50.535
- Ah, Mr Healey.
- Doctor.

02:05:51.215 --> 02:05:53.253
Ah, Mr Baines.

02:05:53.255 --> 02:05:54.893
John Tyas of the London Times.

02:05:54.895 --> 02:05:56.612
Edward Baines, Leeds Mercury.

02:05:56.614 --> 02:05:58.612
Make sure we have a moment
for the address.

02:05:58.614 --> 02:06:00.493
- Aye, aye.
- John Smith,

02:06:00.495 --> 02:06:03.052
Editor of the Liverpool Mercury
and Political Herald.

02:06:03.054 --> 02:06:04.373
Good to have you here, sir.

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.493
I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir.

02:06:06.495 --> 02:06:08.775
- You have my voice.
- Thank you, sir.

02:06:09.775 --> 02:06:11.213
We should have stuck together.

02:06:11.215 --> 02:06:13.373
Aye.
Shall we try and find them?

02:06:13.375 --> 02:06:15.052
No, it's useless.

02:06:15.054 --> 02:06:17.333
- See 'em back at t'house.
- Aye.

02:06:17.335 --> 02:06:20.493
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

02:06:20.495 --> 02:06:22.773
- Can you see 'em, Joseph?
- No.

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:24.693
- They should be close.
- Aye.

02:06:24.695 --> 02:06:26.335
- All these folk.
- I know.

02:06:27.095 --> 02:06:29.773
Well, we're all right.
We've got bread.

02:06:29.775 --> 02:06:33.175
Here's Sam.
Make way for the Middleton lot!

02:06:34.775 --> 02:06:36.612
Make way for Sam Bamford!

02:06:36.614 --> 02:06:38.813
Make way for Sam.

02:06:38.815 --> 02:06:40.853
Here's Sam Bamford.

02:06:40.855 --> 02:06:43.015
Make way for Sam.

02:06:45.054 --> 02:06:48.493
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
We're here!

02:06:52.495 --> 02:06:54.253
Now, lads.

02:06:54.255 --> 02:06:58.614
Stay in your ranks and all
folks stay close to t'colours.

02:07:03.855 --> 02:07:05.733
Go on, Sam!

02:07:12.335 --> 02:07:15.255
- Hello, Mr Bamford!
- Mr Bamford!

02:07:16.175 --> 02:07:18.093
- Hello, Mr Bamford.
- Now, then, Sam.

02:07:18.095 --> 02:07:20.612
- We have arrived!
- Behold!

02:07:20.614 --> 02:07:22.735
I can barely believe it, John.

02:07:23.855 --> 02:07:25.813
- Doctor! What a day, eh?
- Sam!

02:07:25.815 --> 02:07:27.735
- What a day.
- Mr Johnson.

02:07:28.375 --> 02:07:30.735
I do not want Mr Bamford
on the hustings.

02:07:33.855 --> 02:07:35.733
Hey, John. How do?

02:07:35.735 --> 02:07:37.412
This is only the beginning,
Sam.

02:07:37.414 --> 02:07:39.335
Aye, true.

02:07:40.895 --> 02:07:42.893
Mr Hunt.

02:07:42.895 --> 02:07:44.493
Joseph.

02:07:44.495 --> 02:07:46.412
Is tha' impressed
wi' t'turnout, Joe?

02:07:46.414 --> 02:07:48.013
Aye, I am indeed, Sam.

02:07:48.015 --> 02:07:51.175
Now, shall I speak afore
Mr Hunt or after him?

02:07:55.054 --> 02:07:57.575
We agreed there is to be only
one speaker on this occasion.

02:07:59.215 --> 02:08:01.333
Only one speaker
was advertised, Mr Bamford.

02:08:01.335 --> 02:08:02.855
That was myself.

02:08:08.215 --> 02:08:11.333
Well, 'ere is your audience,
Orator Hunt.

02:08:11.335 --> 02:08:14.612
And pray remember
they deserve much more

02:08:14.614 --> 02:08:17.375
than fine words
and empty promises.

02:08:19.815 --> 02:08:22.373
I shall make my way
to yon public house

02:08:22.375 --> 02:08:24.493
where I shall rest my feet,

02:08:24.495 --> 02:08:28.453
for it has been a long,
long journey to this place.

02:08:28.455 --> 02:08:32.935
And what you have to say, sir,
I have heard many a time afore.

02:08:33.855 --> 02:08:35.013
Many a time.

02:08:35.015 --> 02:08:37.093
Hey, Mr Bamford,
do not leave us!

02:08:37.095 --> 02:08:39.292
Aye, lads, well done
for turning out, lads.

02:08:39.294 --> 02:08:40.973
- It is a great shame, Samuel.
- Sam.

02:08:40.975 --> 02:08:43.855
- Sam! Samuel!
- Mr Bamford?

02:08:44.815 --> 02:08:47.693
- He's getting down.
- He's got a right cob on.

02:08:47.695 --> 02:08:50.054
Wait, please.

02:08:52.455 --> 02:08:54.414
Mr Johnson, might we commence?

02:08:55.255 --> 02:08:57.173
Aye. If you are ready, Mr Hunt.

02:08:57.175 --> 02:08:58.733
Good man.

02:08:58.735 --> 02:09:00.253
Have courage.

02:09:00.255 --> 02:09:02.052
Breathe from the bottom
of your lungs

02:09:02.054 --> 02:09:04.652
and speak at
the top of your voice.

02:09:08.815 --> 02:09:10.333
Fellow citizens...

02:09:15.855 --> 02:09:18.173
It er...
It is with great honour

02:09:18.175 --> 02:09:22.373
that I should like to propose
Mr Henry Hunt Esquire

02:09:22.375 --> 02:09:23.813
as our chairman.

02:09:29.935 --> 02:09:32.453
Let's see what he has to say,
eh?

02:09:32.455 --> 02:09:34.614
Let's see what he has to say!

02:09:37.414 --> 02:09:39.095
Go on, Henry!

02:10:20.375 --> 02:10:22.335
Gentlemen...

02:10:23.535 --> 02:10:25.935
Friends, all.

02:10:27.855 --> 02:10:30.333
The Riot Act, Mr Ethelston.

02:10:30.335 --> 02:10:31.893
I shall bear you witness.

02:10:31.895 --> 02:10:34.054
"Our
Sovereign Lord, the King...

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:37.255
..chargeth and commandeth
all person..."

02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:41.654
It would be hardly
worthwhile...

02:10:43.455 --> 02:10:45.652
"..to depart
to their habitations,

02:10:45.654 --> 02:10:46.973
or to their lawful business..."

02:10:46.975 --> 02:10:49.333
..given the magnificent volume
of people

02:10:49.335 --> 02:10:51.052
so peaceably assembled
here today...

02:10:51.054 --> 02:10:53.453
"..upon the pains
contained in the Act

02:10:53.455 --> 02:10:56.412
made in the first year
of King George

02:10:56.414 --> 02:11:00.612
for preventing tumults
and riotous assemblies."

02:11:00.614 --> 02:11:03.253
God save the King!

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:05.093
God save the King!

02:11:05.095 --> 02:11:08.493
That is for the Yeomanry,
this is for Colonel L'Estrange.

02:11:08.495 --> 02:11:10.614
Somebody summon my man.

02:11:12.335 --> 02:11:14.013
Mandley!

02:11:14.015 --> 02:11:15.373
- Yes, sir?
- Mandley.

02:11:15.375 --> 02:11:17.453
- Dispatches.
- Be ready.

02:11:17.455 --> 02:11:18.773
Mandley.

02:11:18.775 --> 02:11:20.015
Time is of the essence.

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:25.255
Well, stop fiddling,
man, hurry!

02:11:25.975 --> 02:11:29.253
- The warrant, sir!
- Mr Hulton, the warrant!

02:11:29.255 --> 02:11:32.292
Yes, gentlemen,
I am well aware!

02:11:32.294 --> 02:11:34.052
- Henry Hunt.
- John Knight.

02:11:34.054 --> 02:11:35.333
Johnson.

02:11:35.335 --> 02:11:37.493
Hulton, whatever actions
we take here today

02:11:37.495 --> 02:11:39.733
will have serious repercussions
thereafter.

02:11:39.735 --> 02:11:41.013
Mr Norris, please.

02:11:41.015 --> 02:11:42.493
I've no wish
to find myself in the dock.

02:11:42.495 --> 02:11:45.813
The only people in the dock
will be those blaggards.

02:11:49.695 --> 02:11:52.173
Here, I wish someone
would tell him to speak up.

02:11:52.175 --> 02:11:54.335
Aye. I can't hear nowt.

02:11:55.895 --> 02:11:58.095
- Can you see owt?
- Not really, no.

02:11:59.375 --> 02:12:01.893
- Where've thou come from?
- Wigan.

02:12:01.895 --> 02:12:04.054
Oh, aye, that's a fair way.

02:12:05.455 --> 02:12:07.933
- Is this your brother?
- Aye, he is.

02:12:07.935 --> 02:12:09.935
Aye, you can tell.

02:12:11.175 --> 02:12:12.933
You must have been
up with the lark.

02:12:12.935 --> 02:12:14.735
Aye, set off at six.

02:12:16.054 --> 02:12:17.453
Have you not brought
owt to eat?

02:12:17.455 --> 02:12:19.612
- No, we didn't think to.
- Nah.

02:12:19.614 --> 02:12:21.493
Well, do you want some bread?

02:12:21.495 --> 02:12:23.733
- Oh, no, you're all right.
- Aye, go on.

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:26.052
You must be famished
coming all t'way from Wigan.

02:12:26.054 --> 02:12:27.733
- You sure?
- Aye.

02:12:27.735 --> 02:12:30.052
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

02:12:30.054 --> 02:12:32.455
There you go, Mary.
Pass that round.

02:12:33.255 --> 02:12:35.373
Save some
for your father and Robert.

02:12:35.375 --> 02:12:37.654
That's if we ever
see 'em again.

02:12:47.175 --> 02:12:49.535
- Gentlemen!
- Men of the 15th!

02:12:50.375 --> 02:12:52.375
Mount Up!

02:12:56.414 --> 02:12:58.533
Mr Nadin!

02:12:58.535 --> 02:13:01.973
..all the many
and nefarious means

02:13:01.975 --> 02:13:03.612
- employed by those...
- Nadin!

02:13:03.614 --> 02:13:06.453
- ..in authority to delay...
- Show restraint.

02:13:10.975 --> 02:13:13.612
..our harmonious assembly.

02:13:15.414 --> 02:13:17.455
But let me simply avow...

02:13:18.614 --> 02:13:22.255
..that they have
roundly failed!

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:25.893
Mr Hunt.
The Yeomanry is here.

02:13:25.895 --> 02:13:28.733
- This will not end well.
- Mr Knight, please!

02:13:31.855 --> 02:13:36.253
And they will
continue to fail...

02:13:36.255 --> 02:13:37.773
It's the Yeomanry.

02:13:37.775 --> 02:13:40.292
We must stick together
and try not to be afeared.

02:13:45.335 --> 02:13:47.292
..of peace...

02:13:47.294 --> 02:13:50.373
of unity and of hope...

02:13:50.375 --> 02:13:51.773
They're reprobates.

02:14:00.815 --> 02:14:02.453
Gentlemen...

02:14:02.455 --> 02:14:04.373
I ask you to give
three cheers!

02:14:04.375 --> 02:14:06.333
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

02:14:06.335 --> 02:14:07.695
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

02:14:09.414 --> 02:14:10.733
- Hunt.
- Huzzah!

02:14:10.735 --> 02:14:12.412
Henry Hunt.

02:14:12.414 --> 02:14:13.773
I hold a warrant
for your arrest.

02:14:13.775 --> 02:14:16.693
You put this meeting and
the lives of all those here...

02:14:16.695 --> 02:14:19.335
You'll come with me!

02:14:22.175 --> 02:14:23.614
Mr Hunt!

02:14:24.255 --> 02:14:25.733
- John! John!
- Come with me!

02:14:25.735 --> 02:14:27.975
This is a peaceful protest!

02:14:29.095 --> 02:14:31.412
I am John Tyas
of the London Times!

02:14:31.414 --> 02:14:32.735
I care not!

02:14:35.535 --> 02:14:38.654
Come on!

02:14:45.775 --> 02:14:48.294
Shame on you!

02:14:51.735 --> 02:14:53.693
Shame! Shame!

02:14:53.695 --> 02:14:55.373
God will judge you all!

02:14:55.375 --> 02:14:57.815
Get out of the way, you scum!

02:15:06.654 --> 02:15:08.654
What will we do?

02:15:08.935 --> 02:15:11.253
- What will we do?
- Get her out, Mother.

02:15:11.255 --> 02:15:12.973
Come on, come on, move!

02:15:12.975 --> 02:15:14.853
Let's go.

02:15:18.175 --> 02:15:20.333
You will not silence me, sir.

02:15:20.335 --> 02:15:21.733
You will not silence me!

02:15:25.375 --> 02:15:27.175
My hat!

02:15:28.815 --> 02:15:30.375
Please, no!

02:15:32.775 --> 02:15:34.493
Please help me!

02:15:58.575 --> 02:15:59.735
- Get off me!
- Come here!

02:16:02.855 --> 02:16:04.294
No!

02:16:05.015 --> 02:16:07.054
Shh, shh, shh.

02:16:08.375 --> 02:16:11.935
- Argh!
- John, John! John, John!

02:16:13.815 --> 02:16:16.933
You should be ashamed of
yourselves, you bastards!

02:16:33.094 --> 02:16:34.532
- Colonel L'Estrange!
- Yes, sir?

02:16:34.535 --> 02:16:36.412
For God's sake,
do something, man!

02:16:36.414 --> 02:16:38.933
- What am I to do?
- Disperse the crowd!

02:16:38.934 --> 02:16:41.291
Cannot you see they are
attacking the Yeomanry?

02:16:41.294 --> 02:16:43.575
- Sir.
- On my count!

02:16:43.975 --> 02:16:45.532
Left!

02:16:45.535 --> 02:16:46.852
Left!

02:16:46.855 --> 02:16:48.412
Right! Left! Right!

02:16:48.414 --> 02:16:50.093
Left! Right!

02:16:50.094 --> 02:16:51.772
Halt!

02:16:51.775 --> 02:16:54.174
Draw... swords!

02:16:55.975 --> 02:16:58.253
Troop will advance!

02:16:58.254 --> 02:16:59.493
Walk!

02:16:59.495 --> 02:17:01.375
March!

02:17:05.414 --> 02:17:07.013
Disperse the crowd!

02:17:07.014 --> 02:17:09.412
Forward!

02:17:09.414 --> 02:17:11.733
Left! Right! Left!

02:17:11.735 --> 02:17:13.573
Right! Left! Right!

02:17:13.575 --> 02:17:16.532
Get back! Get back!

02:17:16.535 --> 02:17:18.452
Keep your line!

02:17:18.455 --> 02:17:20.452
- Back! Move!
- Push them back!

02:17:20.455 --> 02:17:23.375
Move forward!
Move forward!

02:17:29.575 --> 02:17:31.692
- Hold the line, gentlemen.
- Get back!

02:17:31.695 --> 02:17:32.973
- Hold the line!
- Get back!

02:17:32.975 --> 02:17:36.052
Hold the line! Hold the line!

02:17:40.614 --> 02:17:43.692
- Get back!
- Dressing!

02:17:43.695 --> 02:17:45.614
Dressing, damn it.

02:17:49.174 --> 02:17:50.093
Dressing.

02:17:59.975 --> 02:18:02.852
- Get back!
- Go on, get back.

02:18:02.855 --> 02:18:05.054
Clear out of the way!

02:18:05.975 --> 02:18:09.094
- Get back!
- Keep the line!

02:18:09.855 --> 02:18:11.735
Keep the line!

02:18:17.414 --> 02:18:20.094
Get back! Get back!

02:18:22.535 --> 02:18:24.611
Get back!

02:18:35.455 --> 02:18:37.412
I know you!

02:18:37.414 --> 02:18:38.733
You're little Joe Lomax.

02:18:38.735 --> 02:18:41.213
Yah!

02:18:41.215 --> 02:18:43.532
You, sir, are a coward.

02:18:43.535 --> 02:18:45.052
Shame on you.

02:18:45.054 --> 02:18:46.532
Hah! Walk on.

02:18:46.535 --> 02:18:48.813
Just like him
to go wandering off!

02:18:48.815 --> 02:18:50.652
- Stop mithering!
- I'm not mithering, man!

02:18:50.654 --> 02:18:53.813
- I just want to know.
- Shift, vermin. Shift.

02:18:55.014 --> 02:18:56.855
Bitch.

02:19:13.575 --> 02:19:16.975
You! Come here, you...
Come here, you, you fat bitch!

02:19:23.375 --> 02:19:25.975
Yah! Yah! Come on!

02:19:30.535 --> 02:19:32.855
Come on! Come on!

02:19:41.495 --> 02:19:43.614
Hey! Soldier boy!

02:19:45.174 --> 02:19:46.495
Yargh!

02:19:57.414 --> 02:19:58.652
Joe!

02:19:58.654 --> 02:20:00.493
Joe! Joe!

02:20:00.495 --> 02:20:01.973
Joe!

02:20:08.375 --> 02:20:10.775
Robert!

02:20:11.414 --> 02:20:13.213
Robert!

02:20:13.215 --> 02:20:14.573
Father!

02:20:14.575 --> 02:20:15.775
Robert!

02:20:16.054 --> 02:20:17.294
Robert!

02:20:17.695 --> 02:20:18.815
Robert!

02:20:19.375 --> 02:20:20.414
Robert!

02:20:22.775 --> 02:20:24.495
Get back!

02:20:45.294 --> 02:20:46.495
Argh!

02:21:21.414 --> 02:21:22.853
Mary!

02:21:22.855 --> 02:21:25.535
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
- Mary, love.

02:21:26.935 --> 02:21:29.853
We've got you, son.

02:21:29.855 --> 02:21:32.855
For shame!

02:21:33.775 --> 02:21:35.575
Gentlemen, forbear!

02:21:36.375 --> 02:21:37.815
Forbear!

02:21:38.575 --> 02:21:40.333
The people cannot get away!

02:22:00.335 --> 02:22:02.373
- Come on, Sir Arthur!
- Move ahead!

02:22:06.695 --> 02:22:08.573
- Bad luck, Byng!
- Oh, dear, old chap.

02:22:08.575 --> 02:22:09.612
What a pity!

02:22:09.614 --> 02:22:11.373
Sir Arthur used to be
a fine horse.

02:22:11.375 --> 02:22:13.292
- Indeedy!
- Quite splendid he was.

02:22:13.294 --> 02:22:16.294
Please excuse me.
Gentlemen, Lady Fitzwilliam.

02:22:16.935 --> 02:22:18.614
General.

02:22:19.855 --> 02:22:22.455
Not a happy soldier.

02:22:36.455 --> 02:22:39.612
John! How do you fare?

02:22:39.614 --> 02:22:41.693
I have been grossly mistreated,
gentlemen.

02:22:41.695 --> 02:22:43.253
- You have indeed.
- Horribly.

02:22:43.255 --> 02:22:46.373
- There will be repercussions.
- There certainly will.

02:22:46.375 --> 02:22:48.335
This is carnage.

02:22:50.255 --> 02:22:52.414
It's but the beginning.

02:22:53.255 --> 02:22:56.093
We must report this heinous
barbarism to the last detail.

02:22:56.095 --> 02:22:57.213
- We must.
- We will.

02:22:57.215 --> 02:23:00.373
- When can you publish?
- Wednesday morning.

02:23:00.375 --> 02:23:03.213
I shall take this afternoon's
mail coach back to London.

02:23:03.215 --> 02:23:05.414
Gentlemen... good luck to you.

02:23:08.775 --> 02:23:11.215
- This is a battlefield.
- Aye.

02:23:11.935 --> 02:23:14.414
A Waterloo on St Peter's Field.

02:23:15.095 --> 02:23:17.335
The Battle of Peter's Field.

02:23:18.294 --> 02:23:19.933
Peterloo.

02:23:19.935 --> 02:23:22.175
- The Battle of Peterloo.
- That's it!

02:23:22.815 --> 02:23:24.693
No, the massacre.

02:23:24.695 --> 02:23:27.773
- The Massacre of Peterloo.
- We must print that.

02:23:27.775 --> 02:23:29.652
Aye. I'll publish it
in my next edition.

02:23:29.654 --> 02:23:32.173
So will I. Come...

02:23:32.175 --> 02:23:33.895
Let us take cover.

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:39.253
Ah...

02:23:39.255 --> 02:23:41.013
- Oh!
- Ah.

02:23:41.015 --> 02:23:42.052
Ah.

02:23:42.054 --> 02:23:44.533
- Un petit bonbon, Prince?
- Ah, oui!

02:23:44.535 --> 02:23:46.412
- Ah... Oh.
- Oh.

02:23:46.414 --> 02:23:48.813
Oh.

02:23:53.495 --> 02:23:57.533
Ah, Prime Minister,
Home Secretary, m'dears.

02:23:57.535 --> 02:23:59.652
- Your Royal Highness.
- Sir.

02:23:59.654 --> 02:24:00.773
Lady Conyngham.

02:24:00.775 --> 02:24:02.893
Gentlemen,
pray rest your arses.

02:24:02.895 --> 02:24:04.654
You must be stiff
after your journey.

02:24:05.654 --> 02:24:07.612
Lady Conyngham, I t-trust
you've recovered from your...

02:24:07.614 --> 02:24:09.975
Stiff...

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:19.015
I missed me morning swim!

02:24:19.975 --> 02:24:22.453
Indeed you did, my love.

02:24:22.455 --> 02:24:25.215
Ah...

02:24:28.054 --> 02:24:29.855
You swim, don't you, Liverpool?

02:24:32.735 --> 02:24:33.973
I fear not, sir.

02:24:33.975 --> 02:24:35.573
Ah. Sidmouth?

02:24:35.575 --> 02:24:38.495
Oh, no, of course you don't.

02:24:39.815 --> 02:24:41.693
Damn and blast
this bloody business!

02:24:41.695 --> 02:24:44.495
Indeed, sir. It is a most
regrettable circumstance.

02:24:45.294 --> 02:24:47.013
Regrettable, Liverpool?

02:24:47.015 --> 02:24:49.173
It's interminable!
When will it ever end?

02:24:49.175 --> 02:24:53.412
Dear England!
Whither... goest thou?

02:24:53.414 --> 02:24:55.373
My old heart aches.

02:24:55.375 --> 02:24:59.493
This sceptred isle.
These pastures green.

02:24:59.495 --> 02:25:02.052
- Arcadia threatened.
- Arcadia!

02:25:02.054 --> 02:25:05.573
Indeed, Lady Conyngham.
Perfidious Albion doomed.

02:25:05.575 --> 02:25:08.933
Cursed by these malignant
agents of m-m-malcontent.

02:25:08.935 --> 02:25:11.052
The creeping cholera
of revolution.

02:25:11.054 --> 02:25:12.612
Damn it, it gets worse
by the hour.

02:25:12.614 --> 02:25:14.453
I fear for me neck
more than ever.

02:25:14.455 --> 02:25:16.093
- Oh!
- God forbid, sir.

02:25:16.095 --> 02:25:20.173
Well... I know what is good
for my people,

02:25:20.175 --> 02:25:22.495
better than
they know themselves.

02:25:23.255 --> 02:25:26.292
We must not be held to ransom
by the mob.

02:25:26.294 --> 02:25:28.573
- Indeed not.
- Sir...

02:25:28.575 --> 02:25:32.853
there shall be no further
insurrection in this l-land.

02:25:32.855 --> 02:25:34.775
Your government will ensure it.

02:25:35.735 --> 02:25:37.294
I thank ye.

02:25:39.815 --> 02:25:42.733
Gentlemen,
I should like you to convey

02:25:42.735 --> 02:25:44.735
to the magistrates at...

02:25:46.054 --> 02:25:48.253
- Where?
- Manchester.

02:25:48.255 --> 02:25:50.815
Yes, yes, of course,
Manchester.

02:25:52.414 --> 02:25:53.893
Kindly inform them

02:25:53.895 --> 02:25:57.535
of my most gracious
appreciation of their conduct,

02:25:58.575 --> 02:26:01.893
and of the great satisfaction
I have derived

02:26:01.895 --> 02:26:06.335
from their prompt, decisive
and effective measures...

02:26:07.495 --> 02:26:10.612
..to preserve
the public tranquillity.

02:26:10.614 --> 02:26:13.054
Tranquillity.

02:26:14.294 --> 02:26:15.975
- We shall, sir.
- Indeed.

02:26:16.815 --> 02:26:18.375
Good.

02:26:19.015 --> 02:26:22.095
- To England!
- To England!

02:26:24.895 --> 02:26:26.933
Tranquillity.

02:26:26.935 --> 02:26:29.015
Mm.

02:26:38.654 --> 02:26:41.333
I heard a voice from heaven,
saying unto me,

02:26:41.335 --> 02:26:42.773
"Write,

02:26:42.775 --> 02:26:43.893
'From henceforth

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:46.495
blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord.'

02:26:47.575 --> 02:26:49.693
Even so," saith the Spirit,

02:26:49.695 --> 02:26:51.895
"for they rest from
their labour."

02:26:52.935 --> 02:26:55.373
Lord have mercy upon us.

02:26:55.375 --> 02:26:57.255
Christ have mercy upon us.

02:26:57.935 --> 02:26:59.975
Lord have mercy upon us.

02:27:01.175 --> 02:27:03.933
Our Father,
which art in heaven,

02:27:03.935 --> 02:27:06.093
Hallowed be thy Name,

02:27:06.095 --> 02:27:07.333
Thy Kingdom come,

02:27:07.335 --> 02:27:10.495
Thy will be done,
in earth as it is in heaven.

02:27:11.614 --> 02:27:13.493
Give us this day our daily bread

02:27:13.495 --> 02:27:15.893
and forgive us our trespasses,

02:27:15.895 --> 02:27:18.575
as we forgive them
that trespass against us.

02:27:19.175 --> 02:27:21.412
And lead us not into temptation,

02:27:21.414 --> 02:27:23.095
but deliver us from evil.

02:27:24.255 --> 02:27:25.695
Amen.
