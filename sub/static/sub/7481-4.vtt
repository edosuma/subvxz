00:04.629 --> 00:05.766
Well, of course it's important.

00:05.768 --> 00:07.234
I wouldn't call you
if it wasn't.

00:07.236 --> 00:09.099
Just tell me what it is.

00:09.101 --> 00:10.208
No, I cannot tell you.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.575
I need to talk to her myself.

00:11.577 --> 00:13.464
Well, I tried seeing her
in the office today.

00:13.466 --> 00:14.998
You did?
Yes, in the afternoon,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.887
but the office
was just too crazy.

00:16.889 --> 00:18.485
I don't know what to tell you.

00:18.487 --> 00:20.636
Look, look, I have an idea,
all right?

00:20.638 --> 00:22.528
Why don't you pass her
your phone, all right?

00:22.530 --> 00:24.545
She's right next to you.
Tell her it's me, Clay.

00:24.547 --> 00:26.663
Okay. Let me get her.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.913
Just try, man.

00:31.915 --> 00:33.661
Tom, I really need
to talk to Monica.

00:33.664 --> 00:34.805
It's important.

00:34.807 --> 00:36.352
All right.

00:39.312 --> 00:42.674
One pepperoni slice
and one mushroom slice, please.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.985
All out of pepperoni.

00:43.987 --> 00:45.094
What?

00:45.096 --> 00:46.337
What are you talking about?

00:46.339 --> 00:48.556
Oh, no, I'm in
a pizza place.

00:48.558 --> 00:52.120
Um, isn't that pepperoni
right there?

00:52.122 --> 00:54.608
Oh, I'm saving that
for my dinner later.

00:56.561 --> 00:58.306
Okay, then.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.727
Um, two mushroom slices, please.

01:00.729 --> 01:02.879
Oh. We're all out of that, too.

01:03.654 --> 01:06.007
You know what?
Forget it, then.

01:06.009 --> 01:07.927
I'm kidding, man.

01:07.929 --> 01:09.350
Hey, I'm kidding!

01:09.352 --> 01:10.971
Dude.

01:10.973 --> 01:12.724
Well, don't go posting
nothing on Yelp.

01:12.726 --> 01:14.974
My boss reads that stuff.

01:14.976 --> 01:16.927
Did I tell you I hate
this neighborhood?

01:16.929 --> 01:18.516
Tell me about it.

01:18.518 --> 01:20.466
It's like a freaking war zone.

01:20.468 --> 01:22.154
No kidding.

01:22.156 --> 01:24.734
Uh, you still there?

01:24.736 --> 01:26.223
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:26.225 --> 01:28.538
I'm just a little paranoid.

01:38.795 --> 01:39.953
Hey, Clay.

01:39.955 --> 01:41.179
It's Monica.
What's the problem?

Everything okay, Hetty?

Yes, yes, Ms. Jones.
I'm fine.

02:30.635 --> 02:33.781
I just can't seem to get
my heart rate up anymore.

02:33.783 --> 02:34.919
Up?

02:34.921 --> 02:36.459
You're trying to get
your heart rate up?

02:36.461 --> 02:37.630
I've been on
this bike

02:37.632 --> 02:40.846
for an hour, and my heart rate
is still a 32.

02:40.848 --> 02:42.419
You're kidding. 32?

02:42.421 --> 02:44.696
Michael Phelps'

So is Serena's.

02:45.803 --> 02:47.241
You know, if you
just, uh, increase

02:47.243 --> 02:49.049
the resistance...

02:49.989 --> 02:52.499
Yeah.
What are you listening to?

02:52.501 --> 02:54.155
Reagan's "Evil Empire" speech.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.875
You work out
to Ronald Reagan?

02:55.877 --> 03:00.278
I find political discourse
exhilarating, Mr. Hanna.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.099
Of course, if
you really want

03:02.101 --> 03:05.276
something invigorating,
I recommend

03:05.278 --> 03:07.659
Thomas Jefferson's
first inaugural address.

03:07.661 --> 03:10.937
Hetty, you're a total
political junkie.

03:13.917 --> 03:17.259
Junkie... is such a...
an unflattering term,

03:17.261 --> 03:18.716
Ms. Jones.

03:18.718 --> 03:21.662
Well, are you planning to watch
tonight's presidential debate?

03:21.664 --> 03:24.377
If I happen to be
in front of a television.

03:24.379 --> 03:25.701
Okay, well, time to go.

03:25.703 --> 03:26.925
Duty calls.

03:26.927 --> 03:28.250
Tell Serena I love her.

03:29.177 --> 03:31.031
What the heck? I was just
bonding with Hetty.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.290
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.

03:32.292 --> 03:34.547
You just sabotaged me.
I just saved you.

03:34.549 --> 03:37.102
You do not discuss
politics with Hetty.

03:37.104 --> 03:38.229
That's ridiculous.

03:38.231 --> 03:40.021
Best advice
Eric ever gave you.

03:40.023 --> 03:42.078
Oh, come on.
So you guys never bring up...

03:42.080 --> 03:43.538
Nope.
No.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.694
You never discuss an article
that you've read?

03:45.696 --> 03:46.988
Never.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.282
Okay, you never talk

03:48.284 --> 03:49.839
about a congressman's
sex scandal and...

03:49.841 --> 03:51.199
Nell, the last
person who got

03:51.201 --> 03:52.791
into a political
debate with Hetty

03:52.793 --> 03:54.350
ended up retired
on disability.

03:54.352 --> 03:56.009
I hear he's
back on solids.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.001
Granger.

04:01.004 --> 04:02.594
Thought he was back in DC.

04:02.596 --> 04:04.776
Not anymore.
He's in Ops.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.230
A voice mail? Really?

04:06.232 --> 04:07.650
Yeah. Could've sent ravens.

04:07.652 --> 04:09.001
I could use ravens.

04:09.003 --> 04:10.490
Come dressed as Jon Snow.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.084
Then I'm Khaleesi
with the dragons.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.919
What are they talking about?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.200
Something about birds
and dragons.

04:15.202 --> 04:16.413
Could be code
for something

04:16.415 --> 04:17.935
totally different,
knowing those two.

04:17.938 --> 04:19.149
Yo, easy, Wonder Twins.

04:19.151 --> 04:21.331
You're scaring the old folks.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.992
No...

04:22.994 --> 04:25.152
Who you calling old?

04:25.154 --> 04:27.245
What?
I'd choose your next words wisely.

04:27.247 --> 04:28.772
I don't... obviously,
I don't mean old.

04:28.774 --> 04:30.700
I mean older,
and I don't mean that

04:30.702 --> 04:32.693
from a physical standpoint,
because, obviously, you're...

04:32.695 --> 04:34.587
I mean that from
a metaphysical standpoint

04:34.589 --> 04:36.547
because you have a much more
mature spirit than...

04:36.549 --> 04:36.996
Ah.

04:37.021 --> 04:39.078
Are you thinking what I
think you're thinking?

04:39.506 --> 04:41.032
Yeah-- push-ups.

04:41.034 --> 04:42.959
Mm-hmm.
What do you mean, "push-ups"?

04:42.961 --> 04:44.354
No. No.

04:44.356 --> 04:45.850
What's-what's...
why push-ups?

04:45.852 --> 04:48.371
Oh, God, really? Push-ups?
Yeah.

04:48.373 --> 04:50.729
And when I say push-ups,
I mean big-boy push-ups.

04:50.731 --> 04:51.896
No knees.

04:51.898 --> 04:53.530
Okay, the only person
who does push-ups

04:53.531 --> 04:55.530
on their knees
is Gran... ger.

04:55.532 --> 04:57.865
Assistant Director Granger,
good morning, sir.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.064
Morning.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.131
A traffic camera
caught this accident

05:02.133 --> 05:03.865
in Hollywood last night.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.564
Who was he?

05:07.566 --> 05:08.665
Clay Everhurst.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.332
Paramedics who responded
said he died on impact.

05:11.334 --> 05:13.333
Was he military
or former military?

05:13.335 --> 05:14.934
He worked
for Monica Tenez.

05:14.936 --> 05:16.500
She's running
for U.S. Senate.

05:16.502 --> 05:18.367
Ah. Former social worker.

05:18.369 --> 05:20.100
She supports
the Occupy movement,

05:20.102 --> 05:22.068
she's a children's rights
activist

05:22.070 --> 05:24.003
and runs an organization
that feeds the homeless.

05:24.005 --> 05:25.903
So, for those sick
of politicians,

05:25.905 --> 05:27.704
Tenez is the real deal.

05:27.706 --> 05:29.506
Okay, thank you
for the Profile in Courage,

05:29.507 --> 05:31.907
but why is a hit-and-run
a case for NCIS?

05:31.909 --> 05:34.706
Eric, play the video again,
this time ten seconds earlier.

05:46.042 --> 05:47.841
That was not an accident.

05:47.843 --> 05:50.741
We need to find out if
Clay's murder is related

05:50.743 --> 05:52.107
to Tenez's campaign.

05:52.109 --> 05:54.574
If it's not, it will be
handed over to the LAPD.

05:54.576 --> 05:56.907
If it is, it's an issue
of national security.

05:56.909 --> 05:58.074
What do we know
about the SUV?

05:58.076 --> 05:59.174
It was reported stolen

05:59.176 --> 06:00.775
an hour before he
was run down.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.475
Facial Rec's a bust.

06:02.477 --> 06:04.341
Driver's face is obscured.

06:04.343 --> 06:06.341
Victim lived alone
in a house on Arden.

06:06.343 --> 06:08.740
Kens, why don't you
take Deeks and check out

06:08.742 --> 06:09.875
Clay's house.

06:09.877 --> 06:12.441
Sam and I will pay Tenez a visit.
Done.

06:12.443 --> 06:15.108
Hi. How are you?

06:15.110 --> 06:16.508
Remember to vote.
Remember to vote.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.775
You know, that's okay.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.675
I can definitely walk
to the curb from here.

06:19.677 --> 06:21.176
- Thanks.
- Hi.

06:21.178 --> 06:22.309
Hello.

06:22.311 --> 06:23.875
- Hi. - Hi.
Hi.

06:23.877 --> 06:25.475
I just, uh, couldn't help

06:25.477 --> 06:27.074
but notice that you
two look very, uh...

06:27.077 --> 06:29.008
Young.
I was going to say informed

06:29.010 --> 06:30.842
because of all the pamphlets.

06:30.844 --> 06:33.876
I wanted to know if maybe
you wanted to educate me

06:33.878 --> 06:35.342
on the issues later or if...?

06:35.344 --> 06:37.243
Oh. Educate you
on the issues?

06:37.245 --> 06:38.876
Those are two women
who are very passionate

06:38.878 --> 06:40.175
about the
democratic process.

06:40.177 --> 06:41.543
Besides, did you see how

06:41.545 --> 06:43.710
they strategically placed
those eagle pins?

06:43.712 --> 06:44.976
Okay, that...

06:44.978 --> 06:47.475
Just landing...
God, that's beautiful.

06:47.477 --> 06:48.742
That is our
nation's symbol

06:48.744 --> 06:50.442
that you just landed
on their shirt.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.187
I know. What a country.

06:52.189 --> 06:54.066
All right, you're up.

06:54.068 --> 06:56.281
You know what?

06:56.283 --> 06:57.490
Be my guest.

06:57.492 --> 06:58.630
What are you
talking about?

06:58.632 --> 07:00.006
You pick locks.
That's, like, your thing.

07:00.008 --> 07:01.988
See, I am all for the pursuit
of happiness, but there is

07:01.990 --> 07:04.034
no way that I am bending over
in front of you today.

07:04.036 --> 07:06.049
Take it.

07:17.055 --> 07:18.867
Not too shabby.

07:22.862 --> 07:26.518
So, we got photos
with Clay's family,

07:26.520 --> 07:28.228
him and his buddies,

07:28.230 --> 07:30.981
and there it is-- the money shot
with Candidate Tenez.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.807
He should have
had her sign it.

07:32.809 --> 07:35.921
I mean, what if she
becomes president one day?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.628
How happy does he look
in that photo?

07:38.630 --> 07:41.843
Surprisingly so. Why?

07:41.845 --> 07:44.890
Because Clay
was looking to jump ship.

07:44.892 --> 07:47.157
He was updating
his résumé.

07:47.159 --> 07:49.799
And writing cover letters,
which no one does for fun.

07:49.801 --> 07:51.187
Would Clay leave the campaign

07:51.189 --> 07:52.980
because Tenez
was slipping in the polls?

07:52.982 --> 07:55.518
Maybe his planning to quit had
something to do with his murder.

07:56.332 --> 07:57.888
Or maybe he knew
something about her

07:57.890 --> 07:59.173
that he couldn't stomach.

07:59.176 --> 08:02.187
Something that ended up
getting him killed.

08:02.189 --> 08:04.928
You can sit over here
while you wait.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.688
We're good. Thanks.

08:06.690 --> 08:10.114
Ms. Tenez may be a while.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.629
We don't mind standing.

08:11.631 --> 08:13.969
I think everyone would be

08:13.971 --> 08:16.769
a lot less nervous
if you sat down.

08:20.097 --> 08:21.744
Okay.

08:21.746 --> 08:23.886
Thank you.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.582
I don't need to sit.

08:32.585 --> 08:34.395
Old people need to sit.

08:34.397 --> 08:37.130
Not worried about
these push-ups, are you?

08:38.812 --> 08:41.511
Who does Deeks think
he is, calling us old?

08:41.514 --> 08:42.696
We're not old; we're wise.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.147
We're sophisticated.
We are...

08:44.149 --> 08:46.158
Wearing mics.
Right.

08:47.874 --> 08:49.586
Okay, Eric.

08:49.588 --> 08:52.386
Button cam, my 10:00,
guy in the red tie.

08:52.388 --> 08:54.034
That's Jack Caldwell.

08:54.036 --> 08:56.077
He's Tenez's
campaign manager.

08:56.079 --> 08:58.767
He's won 90%
of the campaigns he's managed

08:58.769 --> 09:01.720
and is universally disliked
by his opponents.

09:01.722 --> 09:03.524
Who's the woman?

09:04.804 --> 09:06.640
Rebecca Collins.

09:06.642 --> 09:08.379
She heads up Tenez's
fund-raising campaign.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.564
Must be security
detail for Tenez.

09:15.566 --> 09:17.335
Who's the guy
in the blue suit?

09:17.337 --> 09:19.171
Uh, which one?

09:19.173 --> 09:21.402
The, uh,
good-looking one.

09:22.222 --> 09:24.436
Oh. Him.

09:25.322 --> 09:27.466
Andrew Ryan.

09:27.468 --> 09:28.590
Head of security.

09:28.592 --> 09:29.782
Gentlemen.

09:29.784 --> 09:31.486
Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.871
We are reeling over
what happened to Clay.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.777
Is it true what
the LAPD told us?

09:35.780 --> 09:37.107
That he was murdered?

09:37.109 --> 09:38.809
We believe so.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.010
Can you think
of anyone

09:42.013 --> 09:44.021
who may have wanted
to hurt him?

09:44.023 --> 09:46.439
No. Everybody loved Clay.

09:46.441 --> 09:48.618
He was always
pitching in,

09:48.620 --> 09:49.946
always staying late,
never wanting

09:49.948 --> 09:51.275
to take any credit for it.

09:51.277 --> 09:53.728
The morning I
opened this office,

09:53.730 --> 09:55.601
he was sitting on the doorstep.

09:55.603 --> 09:57.386
I gave him the job.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.138
What did he actually do here?

09:59.140 --> 10:03.171
Clay mailed receipts
to our donors.

10:03.173 --> 10:05.153
You know what
everyone here does?

10:05.155 --> 10:06.739
Oh, yeah, and I
know their names.

10:06.741 --> 10:09.052
Every person out
there is either

10:09.054 --> 10:11.796
a volunteer or getting
paid practically nothing,

10:11.798 --> 10:13.845
so it's the least I can do.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.456
When was the last time
you saw Clay?

10:16.458 --> 10:18.307
Here, uh, yesterday.

10:18.309 --> 10:20.985
He wanted to talk to me,
but I was very busy.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.472
And then he called last night,

10:22.474 --> 10:24.918
and when they handed me
the phone, he wasn't there.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.174
What time was that?

10:26.176 --> 10:29.512
Around...

10:29.514 --> 10:31.973
9:30 or so.

10:35.466 --> 10:37.628
Oh, my God.

10:38.428 --> 10:40.921
Do you have any enemies,
Ms. Tenez?

10:40.923 --> 10:43.183
Have you read my platform?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.813
I'm trying to change

10:44.815 --> 10:46.676
the conversation
in the country.

10:46.678 --> 10:49.437
There are a lot of people
who wish I would just go away.

10:49.439 --> 10:52.729
This must be tough
on your staff.

10:52.731 --> 10:54.392
Well, it doesn't help
that I'm getting

10:54.394 --> 10:56.156
my ass kicked in the polls.

10:56.158 --> 10:59.481
But it was kids like Clay
that keep me going.

10:59.483 --> 11:01.344
I could never forgive myself

11:01.346 --> 11:04.837
if my campaign
was responsible for his death.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.556
Not your typical
politician.

11:11.558 --> 11:13.318
That's a good reason
to vote for her.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.286
Um, excuse me.

11:15.288 --> 11:16.334
I'm Lisa.

11:16.336 --> 11:17.635
Clay and I worked together.

11:17.636 --> 11:18.936
He came to me
yesterday,

11:18.938 --> 11:21.507
pretty scared about something
he found in the mail.

11:21.509 --> 11:24.427
I didn't want to show it to
you in front of everyone.

11:24.429 --> 11:26.045
He asked me to hold on to it,

11:26.047 --> 11:28.426
but I told him
to give it to Monica.

11:49.449 --> 11:51.765
If I'm not mistaken,
there's a political theme

11:51.767 --> 11:53.670
to these five photographs,
Ms. Jones.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.351
Yes, they are all
running for U.S. Senate.

11:57.352 --> 11:58.334
Right.
Thanks.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.228
Political junkie.

12:00.230 --> 12:03.373
FBI just kicked it up a gear.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.233
They're alerting each
of the candidates,

12:05.235 --> 12:07.227
but our prime focus
is still Tenez.

12:07.229 --> 12:10.507
Any luck finding the envelope
the photographs were sent in?

12:10.509 --> 12:12.570
No one can find it,
but they're still looking.

12:12.572 --> 12:14.430
Well, let's start
by figuring out

12:14.432 --> 12:17.541
what these five candidates
have in common. Okay?

12:22.479 --> 12:25.759
If these are your targets,
why kill a staffer?

12:25.761 --> 12:28.227
And why make it
look like an accident?

12:28.229 --> 12:31.237
That's hardly
a bold political statement.

12:31.239 --> 12:34.416
Well, maybe Clay knew
something about all this

12:34.418 --> 12:36.309
and somebody wanted
to shut him up.

12:36.311 --> 12:40.266
Perhaps the hit list wasn't the
only thing he found in the mail.

12:40.268 --> 12:43.410
I left DC to
escape politics.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.907
Owen...

12:45.909 --> 12:48.864
you can't escape politics.

12:48.866 --> 12:51.098
You either play or get played.

12:51.100 --> 12:56.650
Speaking of, we should talk
to Tenez's opponent.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.950
Senator Osborne.

12:58.952 --> 13:03.156
Among dirty politicians,
he is the lowest of the low.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.082
I thought you didn't
take sides, Henrietta.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.593
I don't.

13:07.595 --> 13:10.550
But I can still
call a spade a spade.

13:12.522 --> 13:14.066
Clay found this
in the mail yesterday?

13:14.068 --> 13:16.070
We think this is why
he wanted to meet with you.

13:16.072 --> 13:17.858
Why didn't he just
bring it to us?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.249
That's a good question.

13:19.251 --> 13:20.871
Are you suggesting
he didn't trust us?

13:20.873 --> 13:23.388
We're suggesting
you ramp up security.

13:23.390 --> 13:24.449
Not necessary.

13:24.451 --> 13:26.270
Just until we get
a handle on this.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.356
Any new information,
you let us know.

13:28.358 --> 13:30.245
Until then,
it's not necessary.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.066
You're being territorial.

13:32.068 --> 13:34.151
That makes you
a liability in the field.

13:34.153 --> 13:37.597
Thanks for advising us
of the threat.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.882
We'll take it from here.

13:42.565 --> 13:44.054
Okay, you guys
need anything else?

13:44.056 --> 13:45.082
Ticktock.

13:45.084 --> 13:46.108
Yes.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.333
Access to your
campaign's servers.

13:47.335 --> 13:49.081
Give us a week
to filter our e-mails.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.663
Can you do it sooner than that?

13:50.665 --> 13:52.740
Big guy's funny.

13:52.742 --> 13:54.256
All right, Monica,
we got to get you

13:54.258 --> 13:55.477
outside in front
of those cameras

13:55.479 --> 13:56.828
to change the headline, stat.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.972
All right? We can't afford
to have you look vulnerable

13:58.973 --> 14:00.618
before the election.
Okay.

14:02.037 --> 14:03.816
Thank you.

14:03.818 --> 14:06.189
For everything.

14:09.784 --> 14:12.848
Right back to work.

14:12.850 --> 14:16.079
You'd think people on his
staff get murdered every day.

14:17.497 --> 14:18.749
So great to see you.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.431
Yeah, appreciate it.
All right, take care.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.736
Senator Osborne!

14:21.738 --> 14:23.144
In the flesh!

14:23.146 --> 14:25.442
Always a pleasure to
meet a constituent.

14:25.444 --> 14:26.438
Hi.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.325
Oh, you want a photo?

14:28.327 --> 14:29.491
Come on over. Yep.
I'm actually...

14:29.493 --> 14:31.139
All right, Diane,
would you do me a favor?

14:31.142 --> 14:32.581
Absolutely.
All right, here you go.

14:32.583 --> 14:33.542
All right, smile.

14:33.544 --> 14:34.915
Look up. Don't be shy.
Ugh.

14:34.918 --> 14:36.801
There you go. Hey.

14:36.803 --> 14:39.684
Anybody ever tell you
you've got Ike's jawline?

14:39.687 --> 14:41.538
You'd make a heck
of a candidate.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.944
Yeah, no, I'm not

14:42.946 --> 14:44.556
much into shaking hands.

14:44.558 --> 14:46.890
Lot of passing
back and forth of germs.

14:46.892 --> 14:48.813
Well, doesn't matter
with that head of hair.

14:48.815 --> 14:50.836
You're like a wild stallion.

14:50.838 --> 14:52.073
Well, who's this little filly?

14:52.075 --> 14:55.581
Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

14:55.583 --> 14:56.847
Ooh, feisty one, huh?

14:56.849 --> 14:59.219
Bet she's a lot of fun
when the lights go down.

14:59.221 --> 15:01.102
Your reputation
precedes you, Senator.

15:01.104 --> 15:02.562
I'm a national treasure, honey.

15:02.564 --> 15:04.056
I feel like
that every time

15:04.058 --> 15:06.949
the voters of
California reelect me.

15:06.951 --> 15:08.312
All right, let me guess
why you're here.

15:08.314 --> 15:10.293
Uh, this is about
my opponent, yes?

15:10.295 --> 15:11.690
Such a shame what
happened to that boy

15:11.691 --> 15:12.762
who worked
on her staff.

15:12.764 --> 15:15.619
And now there's
this-this hit list.

15:15.621 --> 15:16.659
What hit list?

15:16.661 --> 15:17.698
Oh, that was almost convincing.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.386
How do you know
about the hit list

15:19.388 --> 15:21.238
if it hasn't been
released to the public?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.635
Very hard to keep secrets
in this game.

15:22.637 --> 15:24.356
And, of course, you had
nothing to do with it?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.817
Why would I need to?

15:25.819 --> 15:28.761
I am beating Monica Tenez
in double digits

15:28.763 --> 15:30.811
in every demographic
in this state.

15:30.813 --> 15:32.067
And you want
to know why?

15:32.069 --> 15:33.093
Enlighten us.

15:33.095 --> 15:34.085
She's too nice.

15:34.087 --> 15:36.102
Same reason people
like her so much

15:36.104 --> 15:38.450
is the thing that's gonna
just ruin her in politics.

15:38.452 --> 15:40.566
Okay, so who is
behind the hit list?

15:40.568 --> 15:41.855
I don't know.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.799
Uh, maybe the guy who was
sleeping with her, perhaps.

15:45.826 --> 15:47.114
Oh, just a theory.

15:47.116 --> 15:48.800
That was cynical,
even for a politician.

15:48.802 --> 15:51.082
Son, I have been through
so many elections

15:51.084 --> 15:52.570
that I have seen it all.

15:52.572 --> 15:54.588
There's nothing
that surprises me anymore.

15:54.590 --> 15:58.160
All right. Let's go and leave
the senator to his baby-kissing.

15:58.162 --> 16:00.210
Well, let's not
get emotional about it.

16:00.212 --> 16:01.468
Doesn't really matter anyway.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.584
Wait, why doesn't it
matter anyway?

16:03.586 --> 16:06.462
A little birdie told me
that Tenez is planning

16:06.464 --> 16:07.797
to drop out of the race.

16:07.799 --> 16:10.262
Save face because she's
losing so big, I imagine.

16:10.264 --> 16:11.598
I don't really
blame her.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.344
I mean, you know
what they say:

16:13.346 --> 16:15.914
Politics ain't for
the faint of heart.

16:16.908 --> 16:17.934
Yeah, okay.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.235
All right, troops,
let's go!

16:19.237 --> 16:20.423
What a pig.

16:20.425 --> 16:22.237
I don't know.
Called me a stallion.

16:22.239 --> 16:24.151
Is that what
you're telling yourself?

16:24.153 --> 16:26.757
'Cause what I heard
was that you have a horse face.

16:26.759 --> 16:29.034
No. Ike was good-looking, right?

16:29.036 --> 16:31.145
Like, in his youth,
in a Supreme Commander,

16:31.146 --> 16:32.398
five-star general kind of way?

16:32.400 --> 16:33.851
I mean, that was
a compliment, right?

16:33.853 --> 16:35.896
If it was meant to
be a compliment,

16:35.898 --> 16:38.173
he would've said
you look like JFK.

16:38.175 --> 16:39.315
What a pig.

16:39.317 --> 16:41.866
Osborne versus Tenez
truly has become

16:41.868 --> 16:44.350
something of a nationwide
focal point.

16:44.352 --> 16:46.431
A lot of resources
being poured into the state

16:46.433 --> 16:48.480
by both sides,
as each tries to...

16:48.482 --> 16:49.856
What did we miss?

16:49.858 --> 16:51.030
Tenez is about
to start.

16:51.032 --> 16:52.105
Pull up a chair.

16:52.107 --> 16:54.354
Never a dull moment
in an election.

16:54.356 --> 16:57.198
My campaign suffered
a terrible loss last night.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.779
One of my bright young staffers

16:58.781 --> 17:02.678
was killed in
a hit-and-run accident.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.292
But it wasn't an accident.

17:04.295 --> 17:05.839
I've been told
by the authorities

17:05.840 --> 17:07.630
that he was murdered

17:07.632 --> 17:10.194
and that I am also a target.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.409
Yes, I am saddened and I am
concerned for my staff's safety,

17:14.411 --> 17:16.691
but I will not be intimidated.

17:16.693 --> 17:20.484
And we will not
give up the fight.

17:20.488 --> 17:21.714
So, whoever you are,

17:21.715 --> 17:25.070
if you have a problem with me,

17:25.073 --> 17:26.556
you can find me
on election night.

17:26.558 --> 17:28.299
I'll be holding
a glass of champagne,

17:28.300 --> 17:31.075
waiting for Dick Osborne's
concession call.

17:32.853 --> 17:35.208
That one's got spirit.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.887
What if her spirit
gets her killed?

17:37.889 --> 17:40.180
She just threw down
the gauntlet.

17:40.182 --> 17:42.601
Invited an assassin
to her door.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.699
Where do you stand, Ms. Blye?

17:49.412 --> 17:51.929
You want my
political opinion?

17:51.931 --> 17:54.803
You do have one?

17:56.547 --> 17:57.644
Yes.

17:57.646 --> 17:59.753
Maybe. I guess.

17:59.755 --> 18:02.752
I think Tenez is a different
kind of politician

18:02.754 --> 18:04.237
and our country
needs that.

18:04.239 --> 18:06.375
There is no way she should
back down from the race.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.009
All right.

18:08.011 --> 18:09.997
Then we need
to make damn sure

18:09.999 --> 18:12.877
that we get her
out of this alive.

18:24.397 --> 18:26.682
Of course.

18:26.684 --> 18:27.751
CIA?

18:27.753 --> 18:28.820
FBI.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.871
That's the CIA.

18:32.647 --> 18:34.903
Henrietta, it's Brian...

18:37.363 --> 18:39.113
Mr. Beale,
you have something for us?

18:39.115 --> 18:40.765
We have been
trying to connect

18:40.767 --> 18:42.954
the five senatorial candidates
from the photos.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.301
But nothing.

18:44.303 --> 18:45.581
Two are incumbents.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.334
Three Republicans,
two Democrats.

18:47.336 --> 18:50.263
And there's not a single
issue that they all agree on.

18:50.265 --> 18:52.723
Such is the state of

18:52.725 --> 18:53.970
modern politics.

18:53.972 --> 18:55.486
There are
higher profile targets

18:55.488 --> 18:59.191
running significantly
more emotive campaigns.

19:00.944 --> 19:04.851
One bullet can make
America vulnerable.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.873
Doesn't even have to be
a magic bullet.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.252
Thank you.

19:13.004 --> 19:14.788
You know,
it's hard to assess threat

19:14.790 --> 19:17.046
when Tenez's people
won't cooperate.

19:17.048 --> 19:21.897
Then maybe we have to put
someone in her campaign office.

19:21.899 --> 19:27.377
Someone smart, tough...
and irresistible.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.350
Huh?

19:35.713 --> 19:37.240
Wow.

19:37.242 --> 19:38.734
You are rocking
that power suit.

19:38.736 --> 19:39.730
Yeah?

19:39.732 --> 19:41.522
Feel like a
caged animal.

19:41.524 --> 19:43.914
And I know what you're thinking,
so quit while you're ahead.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.376
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:45.378 --> 19:47.037
Okay.

19:47.039 --> 19:48.929
Power suits make you
think of Hillary,

19:48.931 --> 19:51.687
which inevitably
leads you to Bill,

19:51.689 --> 19:54.543
which then drives
your warped mind to Monica.

19:54.545 --> 19:56.667
Well, depends on what
your definition of warped is.

19:56.669 --> 19:58.926
You <i>were</i> thinking of Monica.

19:58.928 --> 20:00.055
Come on, it's the granddaddy

20:00.057 --> 20:01.949
of all inappropriate
office relationships.

20:01.950 --> 20:07.162
I hope you don't have designs
on that title, Detective Deeks.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.354
No, no, I'm more of
a lady in red kind of a guy

20:09.356 --> 20:10.317
than a woman in blue.

20:10.319 --> 20:12.342
Not helping your cause.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.510
I should go.

20:17.379 --> 20:21.148
I know that you admire Tenez,

20:21.150 --> 20:26.518
but that's also the reason why
you need to be extremely alert.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.521
Don't let your passion
cloud your judgment.

20:30.523 --> 20:32.055
Of course.

20:33.591 --> 20:37.659
Have you ever thought
of running for office?

20:37.661 --> 20:42.362
Well, I ruled Nicaragua once,
for 72 hours.

20:44.365 --> 20:46.598
Don't ask.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.846
Don't ask.

20:52.838 --> 20:56.427
Sounds like you got
a pretty good thing going.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.936
Why come work here?

20:57.938 --> 20:59.814
I want to be
part of the team

20:59.816 --> 21:01.492
that gets Monica Tenez
to the Senate.

21:01.494 --> 21:05.215
You know how many résumés
I've gotten for this?

21:05.217 --> 21:08.537
How many young people
want to work for her?

21:08.539 --> 21:10.112
I can imagine.

21:10.114 --> 21:11.723
And I know it won't be easy

21:11.725 --> 21:13.871
telling them that you've already
filled the position.

21:15.683 --> 21:17.527
Confidence alone
won't land you the job.

21:17.529 --> 21:19.505
Mmm.

21:19.507 --> 21:22.558
You will give me the job
because I am smarter

21:22.560 --> 21:25.005
and hungrier than all
the other applicants.

21:25.007 --> 21:27.723
You will just remember me
because of the confidence.

21:27.725 --> 21:30.305
Well, Monica's gonna love you.

21:30.308 --> 21:31.847
Oh!

21:31.849 --> 21:34.531
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.199
Ah, it's all right.

21:36.201 --> 21:38.200
You know, I've done the same
thing a hundred times.

21:38.202 --> 21:40.203
Just give me a minute, will you?
Sure, yeah.

21:40.205 --> 21:42.371
What a first impression, huh?

21:47.544 --> 21:49.479
Accessing his computer.

21:49.481 --> 21:50.780
Eric, are you getting this?

21:50.781 --> 21:53.283
Yeah. That was
almost too easy.

21:53.285 --> 21:55.019
Don't jinx it. Just don't.

21:55.021 --> 21:58.088
Kensi, you realize
my saying anything has no impact

21:58.090 --> 22:00.824
on the success
of a data transfer, right?

22:00.826 --> 22:03.560
Uh-huh.
Computers make her nervous.

22:03.562 --> 22:05.362
I heard that, Miss Jones.

22:05.364 --> 22:07.698
And it was one time,
and it's really stressful

22:07.700 --> 22:11.001
to have to transfer
four years worth of photographs.

22:11.003 --> 22:12.536
I told you that in confidence.

22:12.538 --> 22:15.207
And Kensi's download
is complete.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.141
In more ways than one.

22:22.014 --> 22:24.181
Mr. Caldwell,
I am so embarrassed.

22:24.183 --> 22:26.951
I am so sorry, once again,
about spilling your coffee.

22:26.953 --> 22:27.919
Please, please.

22:27.921 --> 22:29.187
No, I hated that shirt anyway.

22:30.190 --> 22:33.458
But, still...
brought you a gift.

22:38.264 --> 22:39.731
You'll be processing receipts

22:39.733 --> 22:41.634
of people who've donated money
to the campaign.

22:41.636 --> 22:44.504
And in layman's terms?

22:44.506 --> 22:46.039
You'll be a glorified
envelope-licker.

22:47.375 --> 22:48.542
Tenez for Senate.

22:48.544 --> 22:50.410
Go, team.

22:51.679 --> 22:55.582
If I look at one more e-mail,
I'm gonna need thicker glasses.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.705
Hey, this is strange.

22:58.707 --> 23:03.625
So, someone called
"Anarchist Pastry Book"

23:03.627 --> 23:05.453
sends the Tenez
campaign's Web site

23:05.455 --> 23:09.507
a pretty scathing
message every morning.

23:09.509 --> 23:12.331
And today, they
received two of them.

23:12.334 --> 23:14.127
What did they say?

23:14.129 --> 23:17.948
Well, it looks like the
first is the usual rant;

23:17.950 --> 23:20.840
the second...

23:20.842 --> 23:23.532
"Last night was a taste
of what's to come."

23:23.534 --> 23:26.356
All right, let me trace
the IP address.

23:30.379 --> 23:32.969
Okay, it was sent
from a cafe in Venice

23:32.971 --> 23:35.495
and sender is online right now.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.520
Callen, I think we found
the guy threatening Tenez.

23:50.052 --> 23:51.396
Hello.

23:52.170 --> 23:53.816
Hi.
Hey.

23:53.818 --> 23:54.961
How can I help you?

23:54.963 --> 23:56.977
Uh... what do you recommend?

23:56.979 --> 23:58.995
Ooh, the "Hott-ay Matte Latte."

23:58.997 --> 24:00.474
Mmm?
It's really popular.

24:00.476 --> 24:01.920
Is it organic?

24:01.922 --> 24:04.408
It tastes organic.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.594
Do you use filtered water?

24:06.596 --> 24:07.837
Yes.

24:07.839 --> 24:09.720
I think.

24:09.722 --> 24:12.477
I don't know.

24:12.479 --> 24:13.957
What about the cups?

24:13.959 --> 24:15.739
You guys using
recycled materials?

24:15.741 --> 24:18.093
Um, I could certainly
find out for you.

24:18.095 --> 24:21.690
You guys using energy-
efficient lighting in here?

24:22.431 --> 24:24.144
Is that... oh,
come on, now.

24:24.146 --> 24:25.725
Is that Styrofoam
I see back there?

24:25.727 --> 24:28.048
Would you like to speak
to my... manager...?

24:28.833 --> 24:30.182
You're gonna
recycle that, right?

24:30.184 --> 24:31.343
Sir, if you could just...

24:31.345 --> 24:34.137
You really need that
many napkins for a latte?

24:35.112 --> 24:36.084
Sir, I love, love
that you love the planet.

24:36.086 --> 24:37.119
I'd just really appreciate...
Yeah?

24:37.121 --> 24:39.191
I'm so sorry.
And you...

24:39.193 --> 24:40.572
you couldn't ask for a mug?

24:40.574 --> 24:42.047
Instead, you told them
to kill a tree?

24:42.049 --> 24:43.680
Huh?
Oh, dear. Um...

24:43.682 --> 24:44.873
That's complimentary
and that...

24:44.875 --> 24:46.003
Bingo. Got him.

24:50.963 --> 24:52.721
You almost made me
spill my drink.

24:53.852 --> 24:55.263
There we go.

24:55.265 --> 24:57.460
Oh, yeah.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.846
There we go.

25:02.170 --> 25:04.178
This the guy that was
wasting all the napkins?

25:04.180 --> 25:07.004
No, this is the guy who
threatened Monica Tenez.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.103
Uh-huh.

25:19.746 --> 25:21.204
His name is Ed Mosker.

25:21.206 --> 25:25.187
He maintains a fringe blog,
"The Anarchist Pastry Book""

25:25.189 --> 25:26.646
Part antigovernment rant,

25:26.648 --> 25:29.001
part flourless
chocolate cake recipes.

25:29.003 --> 25:30.860
Anarchists--
they have a sweet tooth.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.854
Just like us.

25:31.856 --> 25:33.083
Hmm.

25:33.084 --> 25:34.741
He's a student at Northridge
Junior College,

25:34.743 --> 25:37.628
where he's enrolled
in the same poli-sci class

25:37.630 --> 25:39.021
twice.

25:39.023 --> 25:41.410
And he's been arrested
over seven times,

25:41.412 --> 25:43.268
all for nonviolent protests.

25:43.270 --> 25:46.419
So Mosker's either
hot for teacher and/or

25:46.421 --> 25:47.879
free speech.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.140
Real question is:

25:49.142 --> 25:51.363
Why is an anarchist
studying the Constitution?

25:53.421 --> 25:54.748
I'm assuming you know the drill,

25:54.750 --> 25:57.170
considering you've been
arrested seven times.

25:59.989 --> 26:02.378
Like they say, eight's a charm.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.634
What's this all about?

26:04.636 --> 26:06.292
Apparently he doesn't
know the drill.

26:06.294 --> 26:08.084
We get to ask
the questions.

26:08.086 --> 26:10.041
That's the drill.

26:10.043 --> 26:11.900
What'd you have
against Clay Everhurst?

26:11.902 --> 26:13.134
Who?

26:13.136 --> 26:16.270
The 23-year-old you ran over
with an SUV last night.

26:23.144 --> 26:24.144
The dead Tenez intern?

26:24.146 --> 26:26.079
You think I did that?

26:26.081 --> 26:28.315
What do you have
against Monica Tenez?

26:28.317 --> 26:30.049
And any of these
other candidates?

26:30.051 --> 26:31.584
Why do you want
to hurt them?

26:31.586 --> 26:32.752
Unbelievable.

26:32.754 --> 26:33.953
This government-sanctioned
harassment

26:33.955 --> 26:35.888
is exactly what
I'm always writing about.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.058
Yeah, we've read your blog--
the, uh...

26:38.060 --> 26:40.394
"Cupcakes With Your Chaos,"
is that it?

26:40.396 --> 26:42.963
"The Anarchist Pastry Book."

26:42.965 --> 26:44.965
Personally,
I don't find it that clever.

26:46.268 --> 26:48.669
I may be an anarchist,
but I do know my rights.

26:48.671 --> 26:50.138
Mm-hmm.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.108
And the e-mails you send to
the Tenez campaign every day?

26:54.543 --> 26:56.344
Last I checked,
I'm still allowed to have

26:56.346 --> 26:57.779
political opinions
in this country.

26:57.781 --> 26:59.613
Not when they become threats.

26:59.615 --> 27:01.415
I wouldn't call it a threat.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.717
I just think
her position on Social Security

27:03.719 --> 27:05.652
would be the downfall
of humanity.

27:06.887 --> 27:09.222
We're talking about
the other message.

27:09.224 --> 27:11.958
"A taste of what's to come"?

27:15.062 --> 27:18.397
I send Tenez one message a day,

27:18.399 --> 27:20.866
and today's Tuesday,
so it was about Social Security.

27:20.868 --> 27:23.135
That's a nice try.

27:23.137 --> 27:25.838
The e-mail was sent
from your online handle,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.841
from your favorite cafe,
at 9:50 this morning.

27:28.843 --> 27:32.678
Anyone who reads my blog knows
I'm partial to that spot,

27:32.680 --> 27:34.080
because of the free Wi-Fi.

27:34.082 --> 27:35.413
And the chocolate croissants.

27:35.415 --> 27:36.982
So you think you were set up?

27:38.417 --> 27:40.218
Someone must've sent a message

27:40.220 --> 27:42.053
to the campaign,
using my screen name.

27:43.156 --> 27:44.823
Guys, you got to
believe me.

27:51.164 --> 27:52.364
He's telling the truth.

27:52.366 --> 27:55.034
Guy cares more about
muffins than mayhem.

27:55.903 --> 27:58.070
Somebody set him up.

27:58.072 --> 28:00.506
Somebody might be
setting everybody up.

28:00.508 --> 28:02.875
This hit list
may be a hoax.

28:02.877 --> 28:05.979
Clay's death wasn't.

28:05.981 --> 28:07.648
Kensi at the campaign?

28:07.650 --> 28:10.619
Yeah. Evidently,
getting high on stamp glue.

28:10.621 --> 28:13.121
So, uh, Eric and Nell
have been scouring

28:13.123 --> 28:14.522
through the campaign e-mails

28:14.524 --> 28:16.924
and it looks like Caldwell,
Tenez's campaign manager,

28:16.926 --> 28:18.526
has been making
political promises

28:18.528 --> 28:19.894
in exchange for
a pretty penny.

28:19.896 --> 28:22.196
That's nothing unusual
for a political campaign.

28:22.198 --> 28:24.266
Yeah, but these promises
are in conflict

28:24.268 --> 28:27.102
to Tenez's position on a
number of hot-button issues.

28:27.104 --> 28:31.172
Maybe Caldwell's making a deal
behind her back.

28:31.174 --> 28:32.707
Maybe Tenez is on board
with him.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.675
It looks like Clay was
looking for a new job.

28:34.677 --> 28:36.645
Maybe he found out Tenez
was playing both sides,

28:36.647 --> 28:38.079
and it got him killed.

28:39.481 --> 28:41.383
I'm gonna need 600 of those.

28:41.385 --> 28:42.385
Yeah, for tomorrow.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.518
Beth, what are you doing?

28:43.520 --> 28:44.787
Grab a sign, hit the sidewalk.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.823
No, no, no, not red-- blue.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.525
Yeah, tomorrow. Thanks.

28:48.527 --> 28:49.559
Are you ready?

28:49.561 --> 28:50.894
Monica's going to
be here any minute.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.061
Yeah.
Can't wait to meet her.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.329
Well, don't get
too excited.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.898
If she loses, you're out of
a job in two weeks.

28:59.036 --> 29:00.935
Okay, with the balloon guy--
we're selling America here,

29:00.937 --> 29:02.637
not cell phones, people!
Come on!

29:04.141 --> 29:05.174
Don't take it personally.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.908
That's just... Jack.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.411
You must be the
new girl.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.445
I'm Rebecca Collins.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.446
Oh. Hi.
Yeah, you run the PAC.

29:11.448 --> 29:13.749
"PAC" has such a dirty
connotation these days.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.718
I prefer Resource Allocator.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.286
Resource Allocator. Got it.
Mm-hmm.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.352
Okay.
Nice to meet you.

29:18.354 --> 29:20.187
She's here.

29:20.189 --> 29:21.455
Whoo!

29:28.331 --> 29:30.665
Hi! Hi.

29:30.667 --> 29:33.034
Hi. Thank you for coming.

29:33.036 --> 29:34.201
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

29:34.203 --> 29:36.137
Thank you for coming.
Hi.

29:36.139 --> 29:38.774
Thank you for com--
look at this little baby.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.542
Yes, how cute you are.

29:40.544 --> 29:41.610
You guys.

29:41.612 --> 29:43.013
18 more years;
you got to vote.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.080
Thank you
for coming.

29:44.082 --> 29:45.414
You bet.
Thanks for coming.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.816
Sorry.
It's just I'm really excited,

29:46.818 --> 29:48.854
and Monica Tenez is my idol,
and it's my first day.

29:48.856 --> 29:49.983
I'm sorry.

29:49.985 --> 29:51.363
Give Ms. Tenez some space, please?
Yeah.

29:51.365 --> 29:53.245
It's not every day that
I get to be somebody's idol.

29:53.247 --> 29:54.216
Hi.

29:54.218 --> 29:55.157
Welcome to the team.

29:55.159 --> 29:56.599
Thank you very much.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.636
Get down!

29:58.638 --> 29:59.640
Look out!

29:59.642 --> 30:01.523
Who the hell are you?

30:01.525 --> 30:02.996
Federal agent. Go! Go!
Let's go! Let's go!

30:02.998 --> 30:04.251
Get out of here!

30:04.253 --> 30:05.849
Move it! Move it!

30:06.540 --> 30:07.763
Put your head down!
Head down!

30:07.765 --> 30:10.302
Get in! Get in!
Go! Get her out of here!

30:31.093 --> 30:32.534
Tragedy struck the
Monica Tenez campaign...

30:32.536 --> 30:35.269
Okay. Thank you.

30:35.271 --> 30:36.694
So they're both in surgery,
but it looks like

30:36.696 --> 30:38.242
they're going to be okay.

30:39.563 --> 30:40.681
Thank God.

30:40.683 --> 30:43.186
I told you people
we can handle this.

30:43.188 --> 30:44.998
It looks to me like
you were lucky Kensi was there.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.876
No kidding-- who knows
how much more blood

30:46.878 --> 30:48.195
would've been shed
if she wasn't?

30:48.197 --> 30:49.842
Why don't you just
stay out of this, Jack?

30:49.844 --> 30:51.853
You don't see me telling you
how to run a campaign.

30:51.855 --> 30:53.006
That's funny.
I would assume

30:53.008 --> 30:54.588
the most critical part
of running a campaign

30:54.590 --> 30:55.807
would be having a candidate
with a pulse.

30:55.809 --> 30:57.554
He makes a legitimate point.

31:01.575 --> 31:04.211
If you're unhappy with the way
I'm doing my job...

31:04.213 --> 31:06.980
say the word,
and I will step down.

31:10.110 --> 31:12.979
There's no need.

31:12.981 --> 31:14.914
I'm dropping out of the race.

31:15.716 --> 31:18.119
Monica, that is a mistake.

31:18.121 --> 31:21.454
My campaign is not worth
losing another person's life.

31:21.456 --> 31:23.023
I've made up my mind.

31:23.025 --> 31:26.160
Look, you've worked really hard
to get where you're at.

31:26.162 --> 31:27.695
Pull out now
and they win,

31:27.697 --> 31:29.630
whoever they are.

31:29.632 --> 31:31.766
I'm not as tough as you are.

31:32.901 --> 31:36.003
We've got one last
press release to write.

31:36.005 --> 31:40.107
I will announce my withdrawal
at the fund-raiser tonight.

31:42.911 --> 31:45.187
Thank you...

31:45.189 --> 31:46.560
for saving my life today.

31:46.562 --> 31:47.765
Anytime.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.338
I mean it.

31:58.783 --> 31:59.785
You okay?

31:59.787 --> 32:00.924
Yeah, but she's
fooling herself.

32:00.926 --> 32:02.231
She is that tough.

32:02.233 --> 32:03.603
Maybe.

32:03.605 --> 32:05.478
But it doesn't matter
if she doesn't realize it.

32:08.561 --> 32:09.964
Callen, I'm with Deeks.

32:09.966 --> 32:11.404
You were right, Kens.

32:11.406 --> 32:13.749
We think the shooter was in
the building across the street.

32:13.751 --> 32:16.160
It's almost
too close to miss.

32:16.162 --> 32:17.567
We got lucky.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.140
He may try again, so,
for the time being,

32:19.142 --> 32:20.714
let's keep Tenez
in the boatshed.

32:20.716 --> 32:21.886
It's too late.

32:21.888 --> 32:23.359
What, she's gone?
Yes.

32:23.361 --> 32:24.865
And she's pulling out
of the race tonight.

32:24.867 --> 32:26.740
Okay.

32:26.742 --> 32:28.281
But until she does,

32:28.283 --> 32:30.658
we're gonna watch her back,
whether she likes it or not.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.734
Copy that.

32:34.141 --> 32:35.681
You as worried as I am...

32:37.055 --> 32:38.648
...about this push-up contest?

32:38.650 --> 32:40.642
'Cause I did some Pilates
this morning.

32:40.644 --> 32:42.171
I'm feeling a muscle fatigue,
and it's coming--

32:42.173 --> 32:43.300
Deeks...

32:43.302 --> 32:44.529
Okay.

32:45.328 --> 32:47.419
What's wrong?

32:47.421 --> 32:50.176
Sam said that we got lucky.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.523
How did the shooter miss?

32:57.688 --> 32:58.749
Hi. How are you?

32:58.751 --> 33:00.509
Good to see you.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.071
Hi.

33:02.073 --> 33:03.998
Stacy, how are you?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.294
Wonderful to see you.

33:05.296 --> 33:06.855
Picture's up.

33:06.857 --> 33:08.550
We've got Callen and Sam

33:08.552 --> 33:11.608
with Tenez, and Kensi and
Deeks at the entrance.

33:11.610 --> 33:14.066
The rest of the candidates
are coming up clean.

33:14.068 --> 33:15.261
It's beginning to look like

33:15.263 --> 33:17.156
the danger's isolated
to the Tenez campaign.

33:17.158 --> 33:21.275
Perhaps we've been
so fixated

33:21.277 --> 33:24.399
on an outside threat...

33:24.401 --> 33:27.655
we've neglected
to look closer to home.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.849
You mean the campaign itself?

33:29.851 --> 33:31.932
Exactly.

33:31.934 --> 33:33.289
A breeding ground

33:33.291 --> 33:36.499
for pride and greed.

33:36.501 --> 33:41.065
Promises, broken promises,
money changing hands.

33:41.067 --> 33:44.769
Delve into it all,
Mr. Beale, Ms. Jones.

33:44.771 --> 33:47.945
Assume nothing.

33:49.799 --> 33:51.717
Wow.

33:51.719 --> 33:54.066
Really brings it all back,
doesn't it?

33:54.068 --> 33:57.208
Presidential election
of '95?

33:58.599 --> 34:00.715
There was no presidential
election in '95.

34:00.717 --> 34:01.775
Sure there was.

34:01.777 --> 34:03.726
Me versus Amanda Belcore.

34:03.728 --> 34:05.347
Class president.

34:05.349 --> 34:07.272
She was a wily little fox.

34:08.117 --> 34:09.635
I remember
I gave my speech,

34:09.637 --> 34:11.797
I ate a bunch of peanut butter
and then acted like

34:11.799 --> 34:13.924
I couldn't talk
'cause I ran out of milk.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.815
It was... it was
borderline genius.

34:15.817 --> 34:18.043
Yeah, Marty Deeks, the
great communicator.

34:18.045 --> 34:19.158
Exactly.

34:19.161 --> 34:20.915
I got my message across
without saying a word.

34:20.917 --> 34:22.637
It was more like a...
like a powerful

34:22.639 --> 34:24.090
interpretive dance, you know?

34:24.092 --> 34:26.893
Mmm. Any chance you can do that
again so I could post it online?

34:26.895 --> 34:27.871
Amanda beat me
by eight votes.

34:27.873 --> 34:29.424
But then I took
her sister to prom,

34:29.426 --> 34:30.574
so who really won?

34:30.576 --> 34:32.127
Not Amanda's little
sister, apparently.

34:32.129 --> 34:33.679
It's gonna make
a really interesting

34:33.681 --> 34:35.808
anecdote for my memoirs.

34:35.810 --> 34:37.462
<i>Freaks, Geeks and Deeks?</i>

34:37.464 --> 34:39.014
Wow.

34:39.016 --> 34:41.042
Pretty quick
on the trigger there.

34:41.043 --> 34:43.136
How long you been
hanging on to that one, huh?

34:43.138 --> 34:44.953
I mean, it's clever,
but it's not that clever.

34:44.955 --> 34:46.909
So how long?
Like, a week?

34:46.911 --> 34:48.556
I'll be right back.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.610
And I came up with it
in the shower this morning.

34:52.949 --> 34:54.424
Hey.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.554
Psst! Hey!

34:55.556 --> 34:57.888
Thinking about me
in the shower?

34:59.742 --> 35:02.108
She's thinking about me
in the shower.

35:05.505 --> 35:08.522
Hey.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.341
Did good out there today.

35:10.343 --> 35:13.565
It's my job.

35:13.567 --> 35:15.898
So, tell me,
who organized the event today?

35:15.900 --> 35:18.558
Rebecca, I guess.

35:19.545 --> 35:22.894
What was the plan
for crowd control?

35:22.896 --> 35:25.160
Well, that would first
require a crowd.

35:25.162 --> 35:28.018
Something Rebecca never could
quite deliver.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.956
What do you mean?

35:29.958 --> 35:31.270
Well, for the
campaign's fund-raiser,

35:31.272 --> 35:34.127
she didn't raise a lot of funds.

35:34.129 --> 35:36.591
Can't believe
we kept the lights on this long,

35:36.593 --> 35:38.758
given the state of things.

35:45.231 --> 35:46.477
Are you seeing this?

35:46.479 --> 35:47.659
Uh-huh.

35:47.661 --> 35:49.071
Whoa.

35:49.073 --> 35:52.751
The campaign's
financial records, Mr. Beale?

35:52.753 --> 35:54.097
We're just scratching
the surface,

35:54.099 --> 35:56.691
but only a fraction
of every dollar donated to Tenez

35:56.693 --> 35:58.597
actually ends up
in the campaign's coffers.

35:58.599 --> 36:01.519
It looks like the majority's
being rerouted elsewhere.

36:01.521 --> 36:04.180
Where exactly,
we're still not sure.

36:15.708 --> 36:18.893
Ten minutes, she makes the
announcement and it's all over.

36:23.165 --> 36:26.567
Kensi?

36:33.677 --> 36:36.236
It's not every day
I get to be somebody's idol.

36:36.238 --> 36:37.820
Hi. Welcome to the team.

36:37.822 --> 36:40.177
Thank you so, so much.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.502
Get down!

36:42.504 --> 36:44.793
Okay, you just made your
"I just found a Kit Kat

36:44.795 --> 36:48.061
in my seat
cushion" face.

36:48.063 --> 36:53.957
The shooter had an angle
on Tenez the entire time.

36:56.653 --> 36:58.708
But he didn't fire until Tenez

36:58.710 --> 37:01.336
took a step towards me,

37:01.338 --> 37:05.311
leaving a clear line of sight
from the building...

37:07.839 --> 37:09.451
<i>...to Rebecca.</i>

37:09.453 --> 37:11.919
Rebecca was the target.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.474
She still is.

37:15.476 --> 37:16.922
Guys, you getting this?

37:16.924 --> 37:18.338
Loud and clear.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.706
Get Rebecca out of here.
We'll stay with Tenez.

37:20.708 --> 37:22.484
Showtime.

37:22.486 --> 37:23.833
Thanks again.

37:25.150 --> 37:26.763
I need you to come with us.

37:26.765 --> 37:27.848
Excuse me.

37:27.850 --> 37:29.691
What? Why? What...
It's okay.

37:29.693 --> 37:31.303
What's going on?
You're in danger.

37:31.305 --> 37:33.049
Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome

37:33.051 --> 37:35.517
the next senator of
the great state of California,

37:35.519 --> 37:36.998
Monica Tenez!

37:40.784 --> 37:42.494
Got it.

37:42.496 --> 37:44.764
Okay, Tenez's campaign
had two bank accounts.

37:44.766 --> 37:46.783
Online donations went
into a holding account,

37:46.785 --> 37:48.331
but only half
the money

37:48.333 --> 37:50.215
was ever transferred
to the primary account.

37:50.217 --> 37:52.267
Donations were being
siphoned off

37:52.269 --> 37:53.849
without anyone knowing.

37:53.851 --> 37:56.035
Who was the signator
for the holding account?

37:56.037 --> 37:59.300
Everybody out!

37:59.301 --> 38:02.160
Federal agents!
Everybody out!

38:02.162 --> 38:03.572
Let's go!
Go, go!

38:03.574 --> 38:05.523
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

38:05.525 --> 38:07.139
Seriously,
what's happening here?

38:07.141 --> 38:08.956
Okay, Monica's
not the target.

38:08.958 --> 38:10.225
You are, Rebecca.

38:10.227 --> 38:12.630
But no one knows
who I am.

38:15.638 --> 38:20.080
Everyone on the campaign does.

38:20.082 --> 38:22.185
I'll get you
some water.

38:28.132 --> 38:29.668
Okay, there were two signators.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.872
One was Rebecca Collins,
which makes sense.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.508
She runs Tenez's PAC.

38:33.510 --> 38:36.114
And the other is...

38:38.120 --> 38:39.521
Kensi, it's Lisa Tran!

38:41.460 --> 38:43.930
Lisa, put the gun down

38:43.932 --> 38:45.601
or this will not
end well for you.

38:45.603 --> 38:48.541
And you think
prison is better?

38:48.543 --> 38:49.844
Lisa, don't do this.

39:05.749 --> 39:07.484
I missed it?

39:07.486 --> 39:10.458
The old folks took
care of business.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.506
All clear?

39:16.508 --> 39:18.443
Yes, clear.
We're clear.

39:18.445 --> 39:21.215
We're good.

39:22.251 --> 39:25.024
What happened?

39:25.026 --> 39:27.095
It was not about the campaign.

39:27.097 --> 39:28.466
Lisa was after the money.

39:28.468 --> 39:31.405
It's all over now.

39:33.311 --> 39:36.583
No, it's not.

39:40.026 --> 39:42.970
Seventy...

39:42.972 --> 39:44.987
Seventy-one...

39:46.974 --> 39:50.216
Seventy...
Seventy...

39:50.218 --> 39:51.803
Seventy-two!

39:53.427 --> 39:55.972
Deeks,

39:55.974 --> 39:57.361
that was embarrassing.

39:57.363 --> 39:58.420
No, no.

39:58.422 --> 39:59.545
No, no.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.463
No, I demand
a rematch.

40:01.465 --> 40:04.044
Okay, but I'll just
double your number again.

40:04.046 --> 40:05.964
No, no, see,
this isn't fair 'cause...

40:05.966 --> 40:07.915
I filled up on hors d'oeuvres
at the fundraiser.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.174
There was too many crab cakes.

40:09.176 --> 40:13.474
Kensi can vouch for me,
if, uh... she was here.

40:13.476 --> 40:14.666
About the crab cakes.

40:14.668 --> 40:16.320
Guys!

40:17.612 --> 40:19.066
Guys?

40:25.056 --> 40:28.993
Have they figured
it out yet?

40:28.995 --> 40:32.100
22 million and counting.

40:32.102 --> 40:33.957
And she would have gotten

40:33.959 --> 40:36.828
every penny of that
if it hadn't been

40:36.830 --> 40:41.996
for Clay Everhurst
being so diligent at his job.

40:41.998 --> 40:43.482
True.

40:43.484 --> 40:46.049
I guess he turned to Lisa
when he caught on to it,

40:46.051 --> 40:48.378
not realizing that
she was behind it all.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.980
And greed took care of the rest.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.052
How did Lisa ever think

40:54.054 --> 40:56.009
she could hide this
from Rebecca?

40:56.011 --> 40:57.732
She didn't.

40:57.734 --> 41:00.636
I don't think.

41:00.638 --> 41:03.132
I think she was always
going to kill her.

41:07.029 --> 41:08.626
And in California, Monica Tenez,

41:08.628 --> 41:11.521
the candidate for U.S. Senate,
has seen a significant

41:11.523 --> 41:13.019
uptick in the polls.

41:13.021 --> 41:14.949
So much so that
she's now neck and neck

41:14.951 --> 41:16.747
with incumbent opponent
Dick Osborne.

41:16.749 --> 41:20.209
Coming up next
is the presidential debate.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.573
This is ZNN
coming to you live from...

41:22.575 --> 41:24.137
You going to watch the debate?

41:24.139 --> 41:27.033
Um...

41:27.035 --> 41:29.164
No, probably not.

41:30.995 --> 41:32.026
Okay.

41:32.028 --> 41:33.524
Good night, Hetty.

41:33.526 --> 41:36.319
Good night, Ms. Blye.

41:36.321 --> 41:37.988
That candidate has two minutes

41:37.990 --> 41:39.998
to respond
to the moderator's question,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.872
and then the candidate's
opponent

41:41.875 --> 41:43.746
has one minute for rebuttal.

41:43.748 --> 41:46.403
After that, the moderator
will pose the next question.

41:46.405 --> 41:47.493
Hello?

41:47.495 --> 41:49.436
Yeah, it's me.

41:49.438 --> 41:50.730
You know what time it is?

41:50.732 --> 41:53.657
Of course I know
what time it is.

41:53.658 --> 41:54.984
You ready?

41:56.251 --> 41:58.588
<i>Direct the first question</i>
<i>to the president.</i>

41:58.690 --> 42:02.774
