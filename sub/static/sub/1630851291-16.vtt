<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:05.179 --> 00:06.571
- True or false?
- Uh-oh.

00:06.615 --> 00:10.227
- You play golf with your wife.
- I do.

00:10.271 --> 00:13.839
- Bah!
- Ohh!

00:13.883 --> 00:18.148
I was very disappointed
in seeing how people who purport

00:18.192 --> 00:20.672
to be friends of Jen
were treating her.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.719
I never attacked Jen,
and that was hurtful for me.

00:23.762 --> 00:27.766
She needs support and friends,
and I can't be that right now.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.551
Meredith and Mary are tight.

00:29.594 --> 00:32.293
What if the private investigator
came across something

00:32.336 --> 00:35.383
and she told Mary?

00:35.426 --> 00:40.170
And that's why Meredith and Mary
were not on the bus with us.

00:43.434 --> 00:46.046
<i>The only thing I'm guilty of</i> <i>
is being...</i>

00:46.089 --> 00:47.743
Shah-mazing!

00:47.786 --> 00:50.876
<i>In a town</i> <i>
of beauties and beasts,</i>

00:50.920 --> 00:52.182
<i>there's only one Wild Rose.</i>

00:52.226 --> 00:54.010
<i>You don't have to like me.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:57.361
<i>I love myself enough</i> <i>
for the both of us.</i>

00:57.405 --> 01:01.844
<i>I have plenty of everything,</i> <i>
including opinions.</i>

01:01.887 --> 01:06.457
<i>I may be known for my ice,</i> <i>
but I always bring the heat.</i>

01:06.501 --> 01:10.200
<i>If you come for me,</i> <i>
I will send Jesus after you.</i>

01:10.244 --> 01:11.854
<i>I was raised a Mormon,</i>

01:11.897 --> 01:14.900
<i>but now I'm raising</i> <i>
a glass of champagne.</i>

01:22.865 --> 01:25.476
Mom, I'm ready for school.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.130
Do you wanna go grab breakfast
while I change real quick,

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
and then I'll take you
to school?

01:32.353 --> 01:33.745
You can make your own eggs.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.573
Yeah, I don't wanna burn
the house down

01:35.617 --> 01:38.098
like I did with
the paper towel roll.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.235
- I love it.
- So this is what

01:45.279 --> 01:47.585
we were envisioning
to host Seth's birthday.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.022
I love this.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.156
And then we would put
the dancer in the hot tub.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.419
But I wanna see how deep
this goes.

01:55.463 --> 01:59.031
Okay, so in theory, they could
dance on this second step.

01:59.075 --> 02:02.644
Wait, but how do you know how
tall your dancers are?

02:02.687 --> 02:04.950
How big of a difference
is it going to be?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.301
Whatever. It's not my party.
I don't care.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.784
Right here?

02:12.828 --> 02:15.961
Oh.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.659
- The dishes need to be matched.
- Those dishes are scary.

02:17.702 --> 02:22.098
These are Mama's.
These are Mama's Wedgewood, yes.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.795
Yeah, you're getting out the...

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
Yeah, you don't touch those.
Those are our "don't touch."

02:26.233 --> 02:28.713
- You know that.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.976
I think everything I got in me
came from her.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.282
Ab-Absolutely.

02:32.326 --> 02:35.764
"You're disjointed."
No, sweetheart.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.026
It's called class.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.071
Ah, I heard that.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.210
What's up?

02:47.254 --> 02:48.733
- John.
- Man.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.300
You look good.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.997
Justin! Looking sharp, brother.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.477
How you doing?

02:53.521 --> 02:54.826
John, you gonna show me
some things?

02:54.870 --> 02:57.133
- Ah, not golf-wise.
- Oh, come on.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.266
Who's this sexy guy coming up?

02:59.309 --> 03:01.137
- What's up, Duy?
- I'm glad you made it, man.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.573
With the beer, man.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.489
Bad day of golf beats
a good day at work, right?

03:05.533 --> 03:07.230
What's up, my man?
Good to see you.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.234
- Me and Seth against you two?
- Let's do it.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.757
- Yeah.
- Let's do that.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.629
All right, well, let's take it
to the first hole then.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.587
Giddy-up!

03:16.631 --> 03:19.895
No sharp turns.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.855
We're gonna play blues,

03:23.899 --> 03:26.118
and we're gonna have Seth
play the yellows.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.165
Be careful of the backswing.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.775
You're the man!

03:30.819 --> 03:32.734
- Oh!
- Oh, I went real short.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.605
It's all right.
There's nothing riding on this.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.651
- 20 bucks a hole?
- That works.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.740
I'm--I'm good with that.
By the way,

03:38.783 --> 03:42.265
65 yards, 4 guys,
no one on the green.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.745
Nobody's on the green.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.312
So pathetic!

03:45.355 --> 03:50.534
If I had my choice to golf
with Meredith or a guy friend,

03:50.578 --> 03:53.711
Meredith would 100% understand
when I say,

03:53.755 --> 03:56.888
"I'd rather golf
with a guy friend than you"

03:56.932 --> 03:59.804
because Meredith
doesn't love the game.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.024
Bam! There we go.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.373
- That's a good one.
- There we go.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.288
- That's a real good one, John.
- Whoo!

04:05.332 --> 04:06.376
- Get up there.
- Look at this!

04:06.420 --> 04:07.508
- Look at that.
- Look at this.

04:07.551 --> 04:08.335
Nice.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.119
Dang.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.381
We got Mother's Day coming up.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.035
Are you--Are you guys
already prepared?

04:13.078 --> 04:14.254
You got your Mother's Day gift?

04:14.297 --> 04:17.866
- Uh...yeah.
- When is Mother's Day?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.607
- It's a week from Sunday.
- I'm working on it.

04:19.650 --> 04:23.524
So you know, maybe we send
the women away together

04:23.567 --> 04:27.092
to some type of excursion
or retreat.

04:27.136 --> 04:30.357
- The losing cart pays.
- That's a great idea.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.097
Like a corporate offsite
for the women

04:32.141 --> 04:33.708
where they can build--

04:33.751 --> 04:35.318
Yeah,
galvanize the relationships.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.928
Yeah. That's strategy.
I feel like--

04:36.972 --> 04:38.016
That's strategy.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.496
I feel like
it's a good strategy.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.802
- That's strategy, man.
- I have to agree. Let's do it.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.369
All right, all right,
we're going with that.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.848
- You're a genius.
- We're going with that.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.334
Let's be honest.
If the women can go on a trip

04:51.378 --> 04:53.554
and start to get along better,

04:53.597 --> 04:56.470
that just means more time
for me and the guys.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.560
- Look at this!
- Yeah, yeah.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.430
- Stop. Cool.
- That is slow.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.084
Yeah, you're on.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.738
So, Seth, your birthday party
tomorrow.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.218
- Yes.
- What do you expect of us?

05:06.262 --> 05:07.785
What can we do for you?

05:07.829 --> 05:09.874
What presents can we bring
for you?

05:09.918 --> 05:12.355
Cleavage encouraged.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.965
- Which...
- Cleavage for the guys?

05:14.009 --> 05:15.967
Cleavage encouraged.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.361
Just make sure that message
gets heard in your house.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.972
Please, Lord!

05:21.016 --> 05:23.192
Oh, my goodness.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.636
- Welcome to the Cliff Spa.
- Thank you.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.725
I have a robe and sandals
for you guys.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.336
Fab.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.993
- Oh. Hi!
- Hey!

05:42.037 --> 05:43.604
I'm just waiting
for the locker room.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.954
- How are you?
- Good.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.652
- Ah, we need a spa day.
- Oh, my gosh, girl. Yes.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.741
You're supposed--this was
supposed to be sporty spa day.

05:50.785 --> 05:51.960
- Take a load off.
- This is sporty.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.179
Well...what sports, pray tell?

05:54.223 --> 05:56.356
We never know where we're
gonna go after, right?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.183
I'll take you guys
over to the pool.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.794
Okay, thank you so much.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.883
When I was growing up,
anytime my mom had

06:01.926 --> 06:04.276
a friend in need,
she would take over a casserole

06:04.320 --> 06:06.583
or get a group of women
to go over and clean her house,

06:06.627 --> 06:08.803
but I'm not in the mood to bake,

06:08.846 --> 06:10.805
and I'm not in the mood
to clean.

06:10.848 --> 06:14.635
So I wanna show Jen that I care
and I think

06:14.678 --> 06:15.853
a day at the spa is something

06:15.897 --> 06:18.203
that she really could use
right now.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.557
It is so beautiful.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.255
Paparazzis are out.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.518
I bet they're doing, like,
a rescue or something.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.215
Here you go.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.611
Do you want me to put these
on the table for you guys?

06:34.655 --> 06:36.308
We're just gonna eat 'em
right here. Is that okay?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.876
Of course. Enjoy. Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

06:47.494 --> 06:51.411
I know.
Bring the lifeguard.

06:55.589 --> 06:58.113
Cheers to the, um,
Garden of Eden.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.288
Mm-hmm.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.855
This is the experience
I was expecting

07:00.898 --> 07:04.424
when, um, you guys took me
to Ted Bundy's campground.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.558
- Oh, I love it.
- Yeah, I don't.

07:08.602 --> 07:12.388
What the is this sh--?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.911
- I mean...
- I much prefer this,

07:13.955 --> 07:16.218
so thank you.
- It's true. This is--

07:16.261 --> 07:18.220
This is the much more
luxurious setting for sure.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.265
I just felt like, you know what?
You need a little me time,

07:20.309 --> 07:22.833
a little luxury time.
- Thank you so much. Yeah.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.313
Every time we try to, like,
take your mind off things

07:24.356 --> 07:27.098
and have a good time,
it comes back to, like, drama.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.578
I mean, Jennie's lunch
and then Whitney's party.

07:28.622 --> 07:32.016
- Yeah.
- There's so much to discuss.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.845
What did you think of, uh,
Meredith, like, defending you?

07:34.889 --> 07:36.934
Okay, I'm very confused
about that

07:36.978 --> 07:39.676
because she was, like,
telling you guys, like,

07:39.720 --> 07:41.199
"If you're gonna be
Jen's friend,

07:41.243 --> 07:42.636
then you need to show up
and be a better friend,

07:42.679 --> 07:45.073
but I'm not her friend."

07:45.116 --> 07:46.553
Like, are you invited
to Seth's party on Saturday?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.250
Did Meredith send you
an invite?

07:52.210 --> 07:53.298
No.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.084
<i>Coming up...</i>

07:56.127 --> 07:57.477
Don't talk to your friend
like that!

07:57.520 --> 07:59.087
No, no! Get out
of my ----ing face!

07:59.130 --> 08:02.133
Talk to your friend like this!
Talk to Meredith like this!

08:02.177 --> 08:03.526
I am done.
Get out of my ----ing way.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.614
What are you gonna do,
jump out the ----ing car?!

08:04.658 --> 08:06.007
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.269
Sit your ass down!
Push me one more ----ing time!

08:07.312 --> 08:10.141
- Go ----ing...
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

08:20.325 --> 08:21.588
Are you invited to Seth's party
on Saturday?

08:21.631 --> 08:23.720
Did Meredith send you
an invite?

08:26.114 --> 08:27.332
- No. I didn't get an invite.
- No?

08:27.376 --> 08:29.204
- And you know what?
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.335
She didn't text you?
She didn't call you? Nothing?

08:30.379 --> 08:31.598
No.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.470
Bitch.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.603
It feels like Jen Shah's
moved on.

08:36.646 --> 08:39.040
It feels like Meredith
hasn't moved on.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.259
Okay, you just don't like me
just because--

08:41.303 --> 08:43.784
because you're an evil-ass bitch
that is pissed off

08:43.827 --> 08:48.092
because her membership at
Facetune ran out. Okay, got it.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.485
- You haven't done anything?
- No, I have got--

08:49.529 --> 08:51.574
- I sent her family--
- Have you liked anything?

08:51.618 --> 08:55.491
Nothing. There was no issue.
We had worked everything out.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.493
I think Meredith
is treating me different

08:57.537 --> 09:01.802
because of the accusations
and allegations.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.630
I'm, like, the easy scapegoat
for stuff.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.327
It's just, like,
throw it on the pile.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.502
But I mean, like,
look at Mary.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.330
Jen's online.
Throw it on the pile.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.810
Mary has said
so many hurtful things.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.594
No, she has. That's true.

09:11.638 --> 09:15.032
But people don't call her out
for it.

09:15.076 --> 09:20.472
What is the strangest phenomenon
is Meredith is loyal to Mary

09:20.516 --> 09:23.301
like we all expected her to be
to Lisa, and that's splintering,

09:23.345 --> 09:24.520
and she's not being loyal
to Lisa,

09:24.564 --> 09:29.220
but she is absolutely
Mary's number one.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.178
And Meredith is
Mary's number one,

09:30.221 --> 09:32.310
and who saw that ever happening?

09:32.354 --> 09:35.357
But that's why--that also
is not in line with Meredith.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.401
Meredith is about,
supposedly,

09:36.445 --> 09:38.099
what's right and wrong.

09:38.142 --> 09:41.798
Come on.
You know Mary M. Cosby is wrong.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.278
She can dish it out,

09:43.321 --> 09:44.714
but the second you tell her
that she said something

09:44.758 --> 09:48.588
very racially insensitive,
inappropriate,

09:48.631 --> 09:52.461
she'll just, like,
"I'm not talking," and leave.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.245
Have you noticed how many times

09:54.289 --> 09:56.030
she will just disengage
and not talk?

09:56.073 --> 09:57.858
Well, that's what happened
in Vail when you weren't there.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.904
Mary didn't wanna address any
of the rumors about her church,

10:00.948 --> 10:02.689
any of the things that
we've seen on social media.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.387
She didn't wanna talk about it,
and we were all so traumatized

10:05.430 --> 10:07.694
by what had just happened
with you,

10:07.737 --> 10:09.652
and Mary said to Lisa,
"Look what happens

10:09.696 --> 10:13.743
when you mess with my church.
You go to jail."

10:15.702 --> 10:18.226
Who--so who's she referring to,
me?

10:19.836 --> 10:23.753
Could--Would Mary have had
anything to do

10:23.797 --> 10:26.016
with these accusations
or the fact that it's public?

10:26.060 --> 10:28.889
Because Mary was not there
when we went to Vail.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.455
She called me that morning.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.196
She's now making
these statements

10:32.240 --> 10:36.548
that, like, this is...
what she made happen.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.292
Girl, you know what?

10:41.336 --> 10:43.904
Honestly, I wouldn't put
anything past her.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.776
I think it's very coincidental.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.735
Meredith doesn't come
to Beauty Lab.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
She tells us
the night before late,

10:50.519 --> 10:53.870
and then Mary, the day of,
30 minutes before,

10:53.914 --> 10:55.350
says she's not coming?

10:55.393 --> 10:58.135
I don't know how in the hell
anybody knew

10:58.179 --> 11:00.442
that we were even at Beauty Lab.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.618
So that's what
everyone wants to know,

11:02.662 --> 11:06.143
is how did they know
that you were at Beauty Lab?

11:08.711 --> 11:12.236
Seems like Mary and Meredith
know more than any of us.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.674
Well, I don't know.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.649
Thank you.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.998
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.391
The keys are in there.

11:36.434 --> 11:40.221
Just bring it back in one piece,
please.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.746
You look beautiful, honey.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.009
Thank you.
You look very handsome.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.496
This is the greatest party ever,
and it hasn't even started.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.671
- Okay.
- And I'm gonna treat you

11:55.715 --> 11:58.152
like my second wife all night.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.675
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.591
- I love it.
- I'm such a lucky man.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.162
Given all of the struggles that
Seth and I have been through

12:08.205 --> 12:09.772
in recent years...

12:09.816 --> 12:12.775
I think that we need
a little room.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.342
You want room?
I'll give you room.

12:17.911 --> 12:22.045
It's been a long time since I've
thrown him a birthday party.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.004
I did not throw him a 47th.

12:24.047 --> 12:27.268
I did not throw him
a 48th birthday party,

12:27.311 --> 12:31.838
but I am so excited
to celebrate 49.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.491
Whoo, are we gonna be able

12:33.535 --> 12:37.060
to put this elevator on pause
for a couple minutes or seconds?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.852
Lookie, lookie.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.160
How are you?

12:50.204 --> 12:53.207
Chloe, fire!

12:53.250 --> 12:54.730
--ing chic.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.688
- Fire alert. Fire alert.
- You're looking...

12:56.732 --> 12:59.387
- Happy birthday.
- Fire!

12:59.430 --> 13:00.997
You guys look amazing.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.131
Hi.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.178
No way!

13:08.222 --> 13:09.223
Brothers!

13:09.266 --> 13:11.051
Big boy.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.531
Benji, Brian, Milo.

13:13.575 --> 13:17.361
This one actually came out...

13:18.710 --> 13:20.451
Hello!

13:20.495 --> 13:21.975
- Look at you, gorgeous.
- I love the dress!

13:22.018 --> 13:24.281
- You look gorgeous.
- You do, too, babe.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.456
Hi.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.547
But Teddy is not
in chic cocktail attire.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.246
I for sure do not wanna be
the one to tell Jen

13:32.289 --> 13:37.033
that Teddy the dog made
the guest list and she didn't.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.602
- Hello.
- Hello! How are you?

13:40.645 --> 13:42.604
- Oh!
- You look gorge.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.606
Chic city. Hi, lover.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.434
- Hi.
- How are you? Mwah.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.609
Did you just see this?

13:47.652 --> 13:51.004
Yeah. I saw it.
It's unbelievable.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.048
No one understands that
this is what you look like

13:52.092 --> 13:53.397
when you get separated,

13:53.441 --> 13:56.357
and you're going back
into the playing field.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.620
If midlife crisis could be
in a photo,

13:58.663 --> 14:00.927
that's what it would be.
- Yeah, that's it.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.799
Jen's not coming.
She didn't invite Jen.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.366
Why?

14:05.409 --> 14:07.237
'Cause she doesn't wanna be
her friend.

14:07.281 --> 14:10.893
It's kinda, like, 'kay, is there
something else we don't know?

14:10.937 --> 14:14.810
What if there's a bigger picture
that we don't know about?

14:21.077 --> 14:22.426
Hi!

14:22.470 --> 14:24.515
Okay, I was going to wear
those pants in blue.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.301
- We would've been twins.
- I'm not kidding you.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.742
- Oh, hi.
- Hello. What's up?

14:33.785 --> 14:36.353
- Hello!
- Hi!

14:36.397 --> 14:37.877
- You're--You're--
- I'm like, who is that

14:37.920 --> 14:40.053
grabbing me from behind?
- Me.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.272
The Meredith Marks
and Lisa Barlow show begins.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.405
They were
at each other's throats.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.580
Do you care about me
as your friend?

14:45.623 --> 14:47.538
'Cause I'm hurt by that.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.540
Really? I saw her walk away
hysterically crying

14:49.584 --> 14:51.412
and calling her husband.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.804
- Meredith, don't worry about it.
- That's it.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.763
Hey, we gotta talk,
'cause I'm, like, so upset.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.199
Yeah, you're continually
attacking me

14:56.243 --> 14:57.766
and yelling at me...

14:57.809 --> 15:00.551
Oh, that's how--
Oh, okay. Bye, Meredith.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.989
I'm not chasing again.

15:03.032 --> 15:07.341
And now they're air kissing
and hugging like...

15:07.384 --> 15:10.170
nothing ever happened.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.215
And it bugs me.

15:12.259 --> 15:16.306
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey! How are you?

15:16.350 --> 15:19.701
Oh, your lipstick match
my pants.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.572
Um, your dancer looks like she's
really having a good time.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.929
Teddy. Hi, baby. Hi, love.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.715
You came, huh?

15:33.758 --> 15:36.718
No, he's fine. I love Teddy.
He is.

15:39.068 --> 15:44.291
Oh. They never forget, though.
Yeah, that loyalty's amazing.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.597
I'm ignoring Jennie

15:46.641 --> 15:50.123
because Jennie deserves
to be ignored today.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.516
Mary, how is your day?

15:52.560 --> 15:55.911
I don't know yet.
Maybe ask me in an hour.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.305
I only came because
Seth invited me himself,

15:58.348 --> 16:02.178
and then I loved the invitation,
and I did come for Meredith.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.920
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:08.402
I know that you have a certain
appreciation for my cleavage.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.882
I thought I'd give you
a mouthful.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.885
So you never have
to hear it again.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.410
She gave you full nipples, even.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.720
<i>♪ Hey, hey</i>

16:22.764 --> 16:24.287
I'm right here.

16:24.331 --> 16:27.029
What's up, baby?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.074
You gotta, like, encourage it.
Maybe--

16:28.117 --> 16:31.033
You put the shell
in your mouth?

16:32.295 --> 16:34.254
Oh, oh, there you go.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.691
- Oh. Pull. Pull.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

16:36.734 --> 16:37.953
Uhh!

16:39.607 --> 16:41.043
Good job.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.305
That made me very uncomfortable,
but...

16:42.349 --> 16:44.742
It made everyone uncomfortable.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.005
- Hi.
- Hello.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.397
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

16:47.441 --> 16:48.833
- I'm enjoying Teddy.
- Oh, my gosh.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.358
- He came and jumped on me.
- Isn't he a sweetheart?

16:51.401 --> 16:53.969
I have his paws on me.
So what's up?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.189
How did you feel
about everything

16:56.232 --> 17:00.541
after Whitney's thing?
- Uh, It's like--it's a struggle.

17:00.584 --> 17:06.329
Um... I just don't feel like
people are real friends.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.809
We're all showing a little more
cleavage, Whitney-inspired.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.028
You know, I figured it was
for Seth's birthday, so...

17:09.071 --> 17:11.900
You're rubbing off on me.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.903
It felt, to me,
like it was an attack

17:14.946 --> 17:19.081
rather than someone trying
to have a discussion with you

17:19.125 --> 17:21.083
so that you have growth.
- Exactly. Yeah.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
We don't know--
all know everything.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
You know, I could say something
that would be

17:25.000 --> 17:26.610
culturally offensive to you...

17:26.654 --> 17:27.698
And I'm okay right now.
There's none of them that can

17:27.742 --> 17:28.830
have a conversation with me
from go.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.310
...because I didn't know
what happened.

17:30.353 --> 17:34.314
Jennie's feelings are 100%
legitimate and valid,

17:34.357 --> 17:36.446
but I don't understand so much
on the shoes.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.405
I don't think that was
such a big deal.

17:38.448 --> 17:42.017
You handed me a gift,
but the way it was given to me,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.801
with my culture,
it was very insulting

17:43.845 --> 17:48.110
because it was like a regift.
- What's wrong with that?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.591
But if she says
it's culturally offensive,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.245
then I believe it.

17:52.288 --> 17:53.420
If it was culturally offensive,
then you shouldn't have took

17:53.463 --> 17:54.943
the shoes when I gave 'em
to you.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.466
You should've been sensitive
to your culture then.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.643
But that's okay. If I
offended you, I am very sorry,

17:59.687 --> 18:01.471
'cause that's not what
I was trying to do.

18:01.515 --> 18:04.126
So you're saying
that you told her

18:04.170 --> 18:06.824
that the--the shoes
were for Jen?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.783
I never told her.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.177
I told Lisa.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.004
- Oh, so Lisa told Jen...
- She had to have.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.093
- I know I didn't.
- ...that the shoes

18:14.136 --> 18:15.746
were not for her.
They were for Jen.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.226
And that's when
the culture sensitive

18:17.270 --> 18:20.011
start pinning, I guess.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.884
But why would Lisa
tell her that?

18:26.017 --> 18:30.152
Baby, Lisa's jealous
of me and you, you and me,

18:30.196 --> 18:31.501
and she's trying to, like,

18:31.545 --> 18:35.810
paint me a nasty person now
to get--because--

18:35.853 --> 18:38.813
you two have, like, there's
a strain on the friendship.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.687
I think Lisa's jealous
of my friendship with Meredith

18:43.731 --> 18:45.385
because she can't deliver
the honesty

18:45.428 --> 18:47.343
that Meredith and I have.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.172
Lisa has this vindictive way

18:50.216 --> 18:52.957
of pretending to care
about you.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.307
She's all about Lisa.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.962
Honestly, like, I feel all

18:58.006 --> 19:00.051
these, like, little digs
coming from her.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.840
I was saying that I have
compassion for Jen,

19:05.883 --> 19:07.189
and you said, "I don't feel
the same way

19:07.233 --> 19:08.277
because of what she did
to my son,"

19:08.321 --> 19:11.498
and I understood that.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.500
You know, even, like,
just saying,

19:13.543 --> 19:16.807
you know, that she's--
she's maintaining a friendship

19:16.851 --> 19:19.549
with Jen because she needs
to be a good person,

19:19.593 --> 19:21.986
is the implication
that I'm a bad person?

19:22.030 --> 19:24.772
- Yes.
- And I feel like the--

19:24.815 --> 19:27.122
she's coming after me
because of the--because it's--

19:27.166 --> 19:28.993
it's got to do with you.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.214
There's a lot of Joe
going around.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.312
Oh, hey, now! Hey, now!

All right, ladies,
from all of us,

20:29.010 --> 20:30.925
we wanna say thank you
for we have the greatest gift

20:30.968 --> 20:33.754
you have ever given to us men,
which are our kids.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.625
You've made us
beautiful families.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.627
- So thank you very much.
- Aw.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.673
So just as
a sign of appreciation,

20:39.716 --> 20:41.370
all of us, especially John and I
'cause we're paying for this,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.938
'cause we lost a golf game.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.374
My fault.

20:45.418 --> 20:49.160
If he misses this,
Duy and John pay for the trip.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.640
Comes down to this.

20:52.294 --> 20:55.602
Ohh!

20:55.645 --> 20:58.213
We're giving you a gift
for Mother's Day,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.128
so this is a treat
for all of you

21:00.171 --> 21:01.564
to go down to Zion.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.479
John has booked us a villa
for you,

21:03.523 --> 21:06.177
and you are gonna have
the best time of your life.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.397
Happy Mother's Day,
and we love you.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.920
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

21:09.964 --> 21:13.489
- Aw! Thank you.
- Very nice. Thank you.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.839
I'm proud to be the mom.
I didn't think it would earn me

21:15.883 --> 21:19.669
a trip to Zion's
with these bitches.

21:19.713 --> 21:22.716
- When are they going, Duy?
- Let's plan for Monday.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.021
- Wow.
- Monday?

21:24.065 --> 21:25.980
Monday. We're leaving Monday.
That quick, huh?

21:26.023 --> 21:28.199
Are we inviting Jen?

21:28.243 --> 21:30.332
That's a great question.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.300
We're giving you guys
a gift for Mother's Day.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.476
John has booked us a villa
for you.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.173
Are we inviting Jen?

21:45.216 --> 21:47.262
Sharrieff was part
of our team as well.

21:49.177 --> 21:53.181
Usually for Mother's Day,
I love breakfast in bed,

21:53.224 --> 21:55.662
maybe some spa time,
I don't know.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.185
But the last thing
I was thinking

21:57.228 --> 22:00.362
was celebrating Mother's Day
with Mama Shah.

22:03.844 --> 22:06.934
Baby, come down here.
I have a surprise.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.545
Okay, what we got going on?

22:09.589 --> 22:13.549
Look, this is our homework
for couples therapy.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.511
Okay.

22:18.554 --> 22:25.735
We are gonna paint to express
how we feel about our spouse.

22:25.779 --> 22:30.131
I am probably
the best student ever

22:30.174 --> 22:31.785
in all of my therapy sessions

22:31.828 --> 22:34.527
now that this court thing's
happening, 'cause guess what.

22:34.570 --> 22:39.096
I need all of the support,
advice, and help that I can get.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.404
I just don't remember
the assignment

22:42.448 --> 22:45.364
saying we had to draw.
He said--He said just express...

22:45.407 --> 22:46.887
- Yeah, express.
- Let's express.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.541
We're gonna express it
in painting.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.151
Yeah. Okay.

22:50.194 --> 22:53.459
As ridiculous as some
of the assignments might seem

22:53.502 --> 22:55.417
to Coach Shah,

22:55.461 --> 22:58.420
I am, like,
no, we need to do this.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.510
So I'm making sure we're doing
every single thing,

23:01.554 --> 23:05.732
because I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore at all.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.429
And then we can keep these
forever.

23:07.473 --> 23:11.085
I don't know if you're gonna
want this one forever, honey.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.826
- Yeah. Yes, I am.
- Well, but you know what?

23:12.869 --> 23:17.091
It's gonna be
somewhat beautiful, I think.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.354
So I wanna know
about the house hunting.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.574
You know, you've done
a good job, baby.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.359
Oh.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.274
It's like a spotlight
on the top bunk.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.494
Why do we need a spotlight
on the top bunk?

23:28.537 --> 23:31.584
So let's look at the master.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.542
Okay.

23:33.586 --> 23:37.590
And...wait.

23:37.633 --> 23:41.985
My stuff and Coach's stuff is
clearly not gonna fit in here.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.987
You're absolutely right.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.686
- It's only 2 bedrooms.
- Okay.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.470
That's not the one.

23:48.514 --> 23:52.605
It's okay. I get it. I get it.
We--We'll find the one.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.303
I just, like, there's just
so much happening right now

23:55.346 --> 23:58.785
and so much, like,
change and...

23:58.828 --> 24:00.221
It's been such
a stressful period

24:00.264 --> 24:01.788
in the last four weeks.

24:01.831 --> 24:05.052
It's been--It's been hell.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.794
And so I talked
to my man, big Justin,

24:07.837 --> 24:09.143
'cause you know I was not able

24:09.186 --> 24:11.537
to make the golfing event
on Friday.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.495
All I know is all of the girls

24:13.539 --> 24:17.194
are going to go on
a nice little trip to Zion

24:17.238 --> 24:20.067
for Mother's Day.
- All of what girls?

24:20.110 --> 24:21.547
- Everybody will be there.
- All the group?

24:21.590 --> 24:23.810
- Our whole group of friends?
- That's what Justin said.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.855
But are you sure
that I'm invited?

24:25.899 --> 24:28.815
Yes, baby, I'm cer--
I'm certain.

24:28.858 --> 24:29.990
Because Seth had
a birthday party,

24:30.033 --> 24:32.253
and we weren't invited.

24:32.296 --> 24:35.343
Well, baby, you and Meredith
have been feuding.

24:35.386 --> 24:38.172
But we haven't been feuding.
She just all of a sudden

24:38.215 --> 24:40.827
is acting strange...
- Well... Well...

24:40.870 --> 24:42.089
...after this whole thing
happened.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.874
Well, ever since
what has happened occurred,

24:44.918 --> 24:47.181
then she's felt
some type of way,

24:47.224 --> 24:51.402
and so if she chose not to
invite us, then that's on her.

24:51.446 --> 24:52.839
Right.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.232
Okay. So what is yours saying?
I'll tell you mine.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.539
"My love for you is strong
and eternal,

24:57.583 --> 24:59.193
and we're so blessed."

24:59.236 --> 25:02.413
Oh, that's so sweet, baby.
I love yours.

25:02.457 --> 25:05.547
Well, mine's not that good.
But I started with a dog.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.549
Because you're loyal
to your children.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.377
You're loyal to your husband.
You're loyal to your friends.

25:09.420 --> 25:13.729
You love the beach, and you love
for the sake of loving.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.296
I love that. Thanks, baby.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.952
We're gonna let these dry,
and then we'll show the boys.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.910
Um...no.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.570
Amazing.

25:31.617 --> 25:34.358
Ohh!

25:34.402 --> 25:36.883
I think this might be
a gift for you, honey.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.581
Oh, yeah!

25:39.625 --> 25:41.278
Hello!

25:41.322 --> 25:44.281
I know that you have a certain
appreciation for my cleavage.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.241
You set the bar for cleavage,

25:47.284 --> 25:50.810
and I want her to get
the same exact cleavage.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.420
I've been talking to Meredith

25:52.463 --> 25:55.597
about getting
the Whitney augmentation.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.990
Oh!

25:57.033 --> 26:00.123
Justin, will you give me
Whitney's plastic surgeon?

26:00.167 --> 26:03.823
I mean, that is art
in its purest form.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.607
For art.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.261
- So I thought I'd give you...
- For art!

26:07.304 --> 26:10.090
I thought I'd give you
a mouthful...

26:11.482 --> 26:13.484
So that we'd never
have to hear it again.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.095
- But that's--
- She made you full nipples even.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.011
Oh, my God.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.578
Like, if you're gonna bring
a rack,

26:19.621 --> 26:21.754
bring Meredith's rack.
Don't bring your own.

26:21.797 --> 26:22.842
Uh...

26:22.885 --> 26:24.539
Whitney, we need comparison!

26:24.583 --> 26:26.628
No, no comparison!

26:29.544 --> 26:32.721
She doesn't think Meredith's
rack is better-looking? I do.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.114
Look at these boobs.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.510
Oh, my God.

26:45.516 --> 26:48.694
- I'm a Miami/
- New York girl, and I actually love Chicago.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.652
- You guys met here, though.
- Actually, no--

26:50.696 --> 26:53.742
He dated my older sister,
but they didn't have sex.

26:53.786 --> 26:54.961
Allegedly.

26:55.004 --> 26:58.399
I would--it would've been
off-limits.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.184
When my sister first found out
I was engaged to John...

27:02.708 --> 27:04.797
Let's just say she said
a few things

27:04.840 --> 27:07.974
that probably weren't that nice.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.150
He kissed her a couple times.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.761
Okay, that--that's okay.
It was just to get to you.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.809
I'm--I'm blending in.
I'm one of the dancers.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.167
No.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.170
I felt like it was maybe
two steps forward

27:30.213 --> 27:31.345
at Whitney's event, you know,
where kind of

27:31.388 --> 27:33.347
some sort of resolve,
like, you were

27:33.390 --> 27:34.696
the measured, defending...
- Yeah.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.393
...neutral one, you know?

27:36.437 --> 27:40.789
I'm scared that this is going to
really hurt Jen's feelings

27:40.833 --> 27:41.703
that she wasn't included.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.965
I think Coach and Seth,

27:43.009 --> 27:45.489
you know, seem to have, like,
a bro-ship.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.449
You know, and so it was
a loophole.

27:48.492 --> 27:51.757
You know, for both Seth and I,
it's very problematic

27:51.800 --> 27:55.674
what has gone on from Jen
to our family,

27:55.717 --> 27:58.851
and so there was just not
a super compelling reason

27:58.894 --> 28:01.592
to do that.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.464
Is there more to the story
that we need to know

28:03.507 --> 28:06.075
so we know what we're dealing,
like, dealing with or...

28:06.119 --> 28:08.164
You know?

28:10.166 --> 28:13.430
- No one wants to be a fool.
- We don't wanna, like--Yeah.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.043
But is there more
that we don't know about?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.740
Of course there is.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.744
I've said a lot already,

28:22.788 --> 28:27.227
and she is a person
who is in a lot of pain,

28:27.270 --> 28:29.533
and I don't know that I wanna,
like, do anything

28:29.577 --> 28:31.753
that's gonna inflict any more.

28:33.363 --> 28:37.324
Meredith is putting
her law degree at use here.

28:37.367 --> 28:41.284
She is giving me
all of the workarounds,

28:41.328 --> 28:44.244
all of the language to not
answer the question,

28:44.287 --> 28:48.814
which clearly states that I'm
going to have to get a subpoena

28:48.857 --> 28:50.772
to get the information.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.001
Take off the pants!

29:04.133 --> 29:05.918
Take off the pants, Seth!

29:05.961 --> 29:08.442
Oh, my God!

29:08.485 --> 29:10.226
I didn't even get
to do the countdown.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.539
Meredith! Meredith!

29:18.582 --> 29:19.714
No, no, no!

29:19.758 --> 29:22.978
Get her in! Get her in!
Get her in!

29:23.022 --> 29:25.285
Go, go, go, go, go!

29:26.982 --> 29:28.462
Yes!

29:28.505 --> 29:30.246
No!

29:30.290 --> 29:32.814
I am not jumping in this water
because I have on

29:32.858 --> 29:36.383
an Alexander McQueen outfit
that was not made for a pool.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.472
I like my outfit.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.474
Should we go in the hot tub?

29:40.517 --> 29:43.259
- Hot tub.
- Whoo!

29:45.000 --> 29:47.437
Oh, my gosh! I love it!

29:47.481 --> 29:49.831
- Oh, my goodness.
- No! No!

29:49.875 --> 29:54.183
Don't put me in! No!
I'm gonna pee in my pants! Oh!

29:54.227 --> 29:57.230
- Come down! Oh, yeah!
- Whoa! Ohh!

29:58.318 --> 29:59.885
She almost ate sh--.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.887
What are we gonna do?

30:01.930 --> 30:03.889
- Yes!
- You're baptized.

30:03.932 --> 30:07.153
Aah!

30:07.196 --> 30:09.808
Yes!

30:09.851 --> 30:14.247
This is the best birthday
I've ever had in my life

30:14.290 --> 30:15.161
since I was in the balls
at McDonald's.

30:17.772 --> 30:18.817
<i>Coming up...</i>

30:18.860 --> 30:21.863
Meredith slandered
my ----ing name!

30:21.907 --> 30:23.517
Just so you know,
I'm not taking away from that.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.389
It's not my fault because
she ----ing had an affair!

30:44.712 --> 30:47.846
So are you gonna make
your own lunch in the morning

30:47.889 --> 30:49.891
for tomorrow when I'm not here?

30:53.808 --> 30:56.724
Mac and cheese?
It's on the package.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.512
That's adorable.
That's really cute.

31:02.556 --> 31:03.949
Is that kind of Zion, though?

31:03.992 --> 31:06.342
I don't know what shoes
I'd wear. Maybe...

31:06.386 --> 31:08.736
- Mm, not those shoes.
- Not--Not my combat boot?

31:12.392 --> 31:16.787
Oh, boy, this is what happens
when I pack myself.

31:19.790 --> 31:24.056
Hi, Whitney Rose, how are you?

31:24.099 --> 31:27.842
<i>I'm good. I'm just, um, packing
and getting ready for the trip,</i>

31:27.886 --> 31:32.542
<i>and I saw your text about
the Cinco de Mayo party in Zion.</i>

31:32.586 --> 31:35.154
Yes, girl. Okay, I just wanna
get you in the mood.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.678
- <i>
- Yes.</i>

31:39.767 --> 31:41.595
<i>Okay, that's why I'm calling</i> <i>
'cause I'm like, 'kay,</i>

31:41.638 --> 31:45.425
<i>this is Jen Shah's</i> <i>
Cinco de Mayo party.</i>

31:45.468 --> 31:48.515
<i>I feel a little pressure,</i> <i>
like what the hell do I wear?</i>

31:48.558 --> 31:51.387
<i>This isn't an outfit contest...</i>

31:51.431 --> 31:52.780
No.

31:52.823 --> 31:56.044
No, this is not--
I am not setting you up.

31:56.088 --> 32:00.048
<i>♪ La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

32:00.092 --> 32:03.225
No, I'm not setting you up.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.679
- How you doing?
- Kevin!

32:22.723 --> 32:24.333
How are ya?

32:24.377 --> 32:26.640
You think we're gonna have as
an exciting ride as last time?

32:26.683 --> 32:28.424
Oh, my gosh.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.871
- Looking beautiful today.
- Thank you very much.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.831
- Hi, Jennie.
- Hello, girl!

32:43.874 --> 32:47.966
- Look at you!
- How are you?

32:48.009 --> 32:49.402
Do you feel like you have
déjà vu?

32:49.445 --> 32:51.578
Yeah! Oh, my God. Yes.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.014
When I sat down in my same seat,

32:53.058 --> 32:55.843
I was like...
this is really weird.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.758
This is, like, PTSD.

32:57.801 --> 33:01.457
The same bus. The same driver.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.806
The same people.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.896
I just hope there's no FBI

33:05.940 --> 33:08.290
coming to raid the bus
this time.

33:13.861 --> 33:17.038
Who's ready to party?!

33:17.082 --> 33:18.779

33:24.698 --> 33:26.613
There ain't no road trip
like a Jen Shah trip.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.180
Whoo!

33:28.223 --> 33:31.879
Yes! I made it on the bus!

33:31.922 --> 33:33.402
- Whoo!
- Made it on the goddamn bus!

33:33.446 --> 33:35.404
- Yes!
- You better stay on the bus.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.927
Stay on the bus this time.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.494
Don't leave me, Mom.
I don't wanna go.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.627
I told you a thousand times.
I'll be good.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.846
I'll do the dishes.
I'll do whatever you want!

33:42.890 --> 33:44.631

33:44.674 --> 33:47.851
Yes!

33:47.895 --> 33:50.289
- Oh!
- That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

33:50.332 --> 33:52.073
- Who's ready for...
- Well, uh... Let's go!

Hi!

34:12.702 --> 34:14.139
It's not my purpose. Hey.
I brought food.

34:14.182 --> 34:17.272
- Oh, wow!
- I brought food.

34:17.316 --> 34:19.318
I did.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.276
- I'm getting PTSD right now.
- I am, too.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.409
- How long are we staying here?
- Before the strippers arrive.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.367
We have to get out of here
before the strippers arrive.

Kevin, for real, we need to go.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.681
This is Vail part two.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.553
So where is Mary and Meredith?

34:37.597 --> 34:40.382
I think Mary probably called
Meredith, her bestie,

34:40.426 --> 34:42.819
and was like,
"Hey, what are you doing?

34:42.863 --> 34:44.560
I'll see you in the morning,"

34:44.604 --> 34:45.692
and then Meredith
was probably like,

34:45.735 --> 34:48.129
"I'm not riding on the bus
with Jen,"

34:48.173 --> 34:50.610
and then Mary's like,
"Well, I'm going with you."

34:50.653 --> 34:52.612
I don't think it's coincidence
that once again,

34:52.655 --> 34:55.745
Meredith and Mary are not
on the bus with us.

34:55.789 --> 34:59.575
Like, is it because Jen's here?
Is it because I'm here?

34:59.619 --> 35:02.926
Do we smell? Do they not like
our snack choices?

35:02.970 --> 35:06.452
Well, she missed the first trip
because of her dad's memorial.

35:06.495 --> 35:07.496
Do you think that's true,
though?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.585
Do you guys think
that's the truth?

35:09.629 --> 35:10.891
What was weird
was that she was--

35:10.934 --> 35:13.067
she was co-hosting the trip
with me,

35:13.111 --> 35:15.809
and she told me the night before
that she wasn't gonna be there,

35:15.852 --> 35:17.245
so I assumed it was 'cause

35:17.289 --> 35:18.942
she had to go to her memorial
in Aspen.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.553
But then you called her.
You were like,

35:20.596 --> 35:22.163
"She's in the middle
of her memorial."

35:22.207 --> 35:23.425
I feel awful calling you.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.298
Jen's husband, um,
is in the hospital.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.082
Meredith, I hate
interrupting you right now.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.605
Go be with your family
right now.

35:29.649 --> 35:32.391
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.262
All right, I love you.
All right, bye.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.612
Yeah, she was in the middle
of something. I don't know.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.005
But wasn't she in Vail?

35:38.048 --> 35:39.180
I don't think any of us
really know.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.790
No, when we got there,
she was in Vail.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.618
None of us really know what--
what the hell was going on.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.925
I mean, It's just twice now.
Two girls trips to...

35:44.968 --> 35:46.535
Three strikes you're out.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.581
Like, that we've all been left
on a bus without them.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.191
So wait a minute.
If I wasn't here,

35:50.235 --> 35:51.714
do you think that Mary
and Meredith

35:51.758 --> 35:53.281
would be on the bus?

35:53.325 --> 35:55.240
Did Meredith say
why she was flying?

35:55.283 --> 35:58.373
She's being, like, vague
about it.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.114
I'll tell you guys what
sealed the deal, okay?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.898
They have a close relationship,
and it's just gotten closer.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.726
- Jen Shah's...
- Right here.

36:03.770 --> 36:06.686
...fake, alleged arrest
and allegations.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.644
And then Jennie tells me

36:08.688 --> 36:12.344
Meredith hired
a ----ing private investigator?

36:12.387 --> 36:14.650
Who hires a private investigator
on somebody

36:14.694 --> 36:18.001
unless you don't have sh--
to hide yourself?

36:18.045 --> 36:20.743
It was mentioned at the Vail.
You guys all heard it.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.615
Jennie, I hired
a private investigator

36:22.658 --> 36:24.878
when this happened.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.664
My son was being threatened.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.492
- Oh, my gosh.
- And the investigator told me

36:30.536 --> 36:32.886
he thought it was
extraordinarily likely

36:32.929 --> 36:34.496
that it was coming from Jen.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.369
Are you ----ing kidding me?

36:37.412 --> 36:40.502
I'm sorry, but, like,
I think we can all agree

36:40.546 --> 36:43.113
if you're gonna hire
a private investigator,

36:43.157 --> 36:45.768
your intention is to do harm.

36:45.812 --> 36:46.769
Why would you need to do that?

36:46.813 --> 36:48.380
She hired
the private investigator

36:48.423 --> 36:50.599
to investigate
threatening texts and emails

36:50.643 --> 36:53.123
that Reid had gotten
and Brooks had gotten.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.864
She got information about you
as well.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.866
How come when we went to Vegas,

36:56.910 --> 36:58.346
Lisa, you specifically came
to me and said,

36:58.390 --> 37:02.307
"I heard that you are
researching all of us,

37:02.350 --> 37:04.047
and you're digging into it."

37:04.091 --> 37:06.049
They all were saying
Jen's trying

37:06.093 --> 37:07.703
to get information on everyone
to, like, use it against them.

37:07.747 --> 37:12.534
Okay, that is so--could not be--
I didn't say that.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.754
I'm busy! I had--
That is the dumbest thing

37:14.797 --> 37:16.321
I've ever heard of,

37:16.364 --> 37:17.757
and now your best friend
of 10 years

37:17.800 --> 37:19.715
hired a private investigator
to look into me,

37:19.759 --> 37:21.848
and no one says anything?

37:21.891 --> 37:23.719
- I'm hearing you.
- I hope you're hearing me,

37:23.763 --> 37:26.156
'cause I ----ing got
crucified before about it.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.636
Well, don't take it out on me,
though.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.290
You said that's the reason,
"I don't know if I can be

37:29.334 --> 37:31.945
friends with you, Jen, because
of all the stuff I'm hearing,"

37:31.988 --> 37:33.816
and your friend actually
did that,

37:33.860 --> 37:37.820
and now here we are, so do
the same standards apply or not?

37:37.864 --> 37:39.953
I don't dig up dirt on people.
Like, I just don't.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.346
- I don't either.
- Yeah.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.825
But your best friend does.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.871
Don't hold me accountable
for what anybody else does.

37:44.914 --> 37:48.309
I don't know why everybody
believes Meredith

37:48.353 --> 37:50.572
when she opens
her ----ing mouth

37:50.616 --> 37:52.270
and words come out.
- I would not--

37:52.313 --> 37:54.184
No, no, no,
everyone believes her.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.838
If Jen Shah says it,
"Holy [bleep],

37:55.882 --> 37:59.277
we need 10 years, 10 judges,
3 priests,

37:59.320 --> 38:00.582
and a bunch of nuns.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.019
Meredith and I were not okay
at pho,

38:03.063 --> 38:05.935
and at Whitney's event...
- You were not okay. You were--

38:05.979 --> 38:07.459
- ...I was not okay.
- She was yelling at Meredith

38:07.502 --> 38:08.808
at Whitney's event.
- I wasn't yelling at her.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.200
- I wasn't yelling at her.
- If you guys don't see

38:10.244 --> 38:11.289
what Meredith was doing...
- It seemed like you were

38:11.332 --> 38:12.942
yelling at her.
- You guys are being--No.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.292
- No, I was not yelling at her.
- You guys are weak as

38:14.335 --> 38:17.295
Meredith slandered
my ----ing name.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.861
How would I know
there was a problem?

38:18.905 --> 38:20.602
If there was a problem--

38:20.646 --> 38:24.214
There are homophobic tweets
regarding my son's sexuality

38:24.258 --> 38:27.435
that you have liked.

38:27.479 --> 38:28.784
- You can't do that!
- I comb out

38:28.828 --> 38:30.873
what I think is right and wrong.
I do. I--

38:30.917 --> 38:33.441
Do you think what Meredith did
all last year was wrong

38:33.485 --> 38:36.488
by targeting me when it wasn't
just my fault?

38:36.531 --> 38:37.706
Do you think that was wrong?

38:37.750 --> 38:39.360
What the
did I have to do with--

38:39.404 --> 38:42.624
with any of her bullsh--?!
I didn't do anything!

38:42.668 --> 38:43.973
I'm not taking away from that
at all. I'm not.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.453
Just so you know,

38:45.497 --> 38:46.933
I'm not taking away from that,
but I have said--

38:46.976 --> 38:50.371
It's not my fault because
she ----ing had an affair!

38:50.415 --> 38:52.634
That's not my fault!

38:58.858 --> 39:02.731
Meredith slandered
my ----ing name.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.080
Just so you know,

39:04.124 --> 39:05.821
I'm not taking away from that,
but I have said--

39:05.865 --> 39:07.954
It's not my fault because
she ----ing had an affair!

39:07.997 --> 39:09.738
If you're not getting it
from home,

39:09.782 --> 39:11.827
you're going to go
somewhere else.

39:13.046 --> 39:16.223
What is going on, Jen?

39:16.266 --> 39:19.705
I don't know.
You have to ask Meredith.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.010
- That's not my fault!
- No, it's not.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.751
- Why is it my fault?!
- I-I honestly--

39:22.795 --> 39:26.146
- Why is that my ----ing fault?!
- It's not. It's not your fault.

39:26.189 --> 39:27.669
But the one thing--
the one thing I have to say

39:27.713 --> 39:29.279
is I don't wanna be
held accountable

39:29.323 --> 39:32.021
for what anybody else says
and does but myself.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.153
- But that's your best friend.
- I wanna--

39:33.196 --> 39:34.981
I am not responsible
for anything

39:35.024 --> 39:37.418
Meredith ever says and does.
- Well, this is--if I heard that,

39:37.462 --> 39:38.854
I-I stand up for what she does
because you can't--

39:38.898 --> 39:41.161
you can't do that, Lisa.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.989
I think it's--I think
I'm in a hard situation

39:43.032 --> 39:44.817
because I care
about both of you.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.209
Lisa, you can't do that, though.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.473
You sign up,
or you don't sign up.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.084
I feel bad that

39:51.127 --> 39:54.217
Jen's finally realizing
that Lisa's a sh--ty friend,

39:54.261 --> 39:55.567
but I was right.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.830
And I'm usually right.

39:57.873 --> 40:00.180
You guys are weak as

40:00.223 --> 40:01.529
Meredith is playing
all of you guys.

40:01.573 --> 40:05.664
She shows up at Whitney's event
being like,

40:05.707 --> 40:09.494
"Oh, my gosh, Jen, who I ----ing
hate with my entire being,

40:09.537 --> 40:12.540
we all--you all need to be
friends with her and show up,

40:12.584 --> 40:17.502
except for me, because I can't
be a friend right now,

40:17.545 --> 40:19.504
and I don't have to tell you why
I can't be a friend right now."

40:19.547 --> 40:22.507
I'm telling you guys,
and you ----ing take that in.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.073
Like, what the [bleep]?

40:24.117 --> 40:25.858
I don't want this tension
with you, Jen.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.076
- I want you to just--
- There's no tension!

40:27.120 --> 40:28.904
I am upfront about this sh--.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.646
You treat Meredith differently
than you treat me

40:31.690 --> 40:33.387
and everyone else.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.172
That's the ----ing truth.

40:36.216 --> 40:38.392
You guys have to understand,
I've been friends with her

40:38.436 --> 40:40.002
for, like, 10 years.
- Good! She's a piece of sh--.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.700
- I know--
- So sign up for her.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.266
Do you know, it's kind of ironic

40:43.310 --> 40:45.617
that Jen's asking me
to choose sides right now.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.488
I <i>have</i> chosen sides.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.752
I have had Jen's back
more than anybody else,

40:50.796 --> 40:52.841
and, like, you know, putting
my friendship with Meredith

40:52.885 --> 40:54.408
almost on the line.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.672
I'm at the point where I'm done.
It's never enough.

40:57.716 --> 41:01.067
You know what? Meredith and I
have to work through some stuff.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.503
The double standard
with Meredith is

41:02.547 --> 41:03.765
I don't know how she can say,

41:03.809 --> 41:06.376
"I love kindness.
I wanna be kind,"

41:06.420 --> 41:08.378
and defend the person
that's the ----ing meanest

41:08.422 --> 41:10.511
in the whole ----ing group.
- Why does--

41:10.555 --> 41:12.252
- I just--
- But why is she doing it, Lisa?

41:12.295 --> 41:14.994
I could be treated the same
and have all these same--

41:15.037 --> 41:17.649
I have treated you the same.
I had your ----ing back.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.259
- Jen, I did. I did.
- You need to stop saying that...

41:19.302 --> 41:20.652
This is what
we're talking about.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.524
...because you didn't when
sh-- went out online!

41:27.789 --> 41:29.225
Well, at the end of the day,
we have to worry about you.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.270
We'll talk to Meredith
about this. It's not--

41:30.313 --> 41:31.924
- No, you guys, I'm tired!
- Yeah.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.491
- We'll talk to Meredith.
- But you would afford--

41:33.534 --> 41:37.103
I'm asking you, would you afford
me the same ----ing thing?

41:37.146 --> 41:38.931
- Yes.
- No, you wouldn't! You haven't.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.498
- You have not!
- I'm sorry. I am sorry.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.890
- I will.
- I will tonight.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.588
- Yeah.
- No, you haven't!

41:43.631 --> 41:44.763
And let us do it moving forward.
From this moment on...

41:44.806 --> 41:46.504
- Yes, I will.
- Listen, Jen.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.985
...we are, and Lisa is going to
from now on, right?

41:50.029 --> 41:52.945
- 100%. Yes, 100%.
- Can we give it? Yes.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.163
- You haven't held...
- Yes!

41:54.207 --> 41:55.425
...the same accountability
than her?!

41:55.469 --> 41:56.775
We haven't,
because I haven't--

41:56.818 --> 41:58.298
- No, you haven't!
- Oh, my God.

41:58.341 --> 41:59.995
Because I haven't
----ing cared.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.258
- About me?! Then say it!
- No, about the other one.

42:02.302 --> 42:04.260
- No, then say it!
- Not you. No. No.

42:04.304 --> 42:07.002
- Then say it!
- You're taking it the opposite

42:07.046 --> 42:10.223
of what I'm saying.
- Say it, or I'm out.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.965
Say it or I'm ----ing out.

42:13.008 --> 42:15.402
Okay, now I'm confused
at what we're saying.

42:15.445 --> 42:18.100
What about all the sh--
that I've been through?!

42:18.144 --> 42:20.450
Jen, I can't go backwards.
I can't.

42:20.494 --> 42:21.974
Oh, thank you
for not going backwards.

42:22.017 --> 42:23.453
Listen, wait.
You and I have talked--

42:23.497 --> 42:25.891
- Lock that--Lock that door.
- Shut the up!

42:25.934 --> 42:27.370
Okay, fine.
I'll shut the up.

42:27.414 --> 42:30.504
That's just as bad as what
everybody else is doing.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.332
Oh, is it? It's just as bad
as what Mary M. Cosby

42:32.375 --> 42:35.727
and your ----ing friend
for 10 years has done to you?!

42:35.770 --> 42:37.598
- Is it?!
- I-I literally...

42:37.642 --> 42:39.165
- Is it?! Is it, Lisa?!
- I'm shutting down!

42:39.208 --> 42:40.383
I'm shutting the down
right now! I can't--

42:40.427 --> 42:41.820
Then talk to your friend
like that!

42:41.863 --> 42:43.735
No, no, get out
of my ----ing face!

42:43.778 --> 42:45.345
Talk to your friend like that!
Talk to Meredith like that!

42:45.388 --> 42:47.652
I'm done. I am done.
Get out of my ----ing way!

42:47.695 --> 42:49.175
- Get out of my ----ing way!
- What are you gonna do,

42:49.218 --> 42:50.437
jump out the ----ing car?
- Get out of my way!

42:50.480 --> 42:51.612
- Get out of my way!
- Sit your ass down!

42:51.656 --> 42:52.918
- Hey!
- Push me one more ----ing time!

42:52.961 --> 42:55.790
- Go ----ing...
- Come on, come, come on!
