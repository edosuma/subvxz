00:00.472 --> 00:04.374
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:04.376 --> 00:07.310
♪ We've been driving on the freeway ♪

00:07.312 --> 00:10.094
...Adam and Jamie go green for science...

00:10.096 --> 00:12.791
I'm actually getting
kind of excited about this.

00:12.793 --> 00:15.092
...and kick their engineering expertise

00:15.094 --> 00:16.591
into full throttle...

00:16.593 --> 00:18.459
When I was a kid, I would've
killed for one of these.

00:18.461 --> 00:20.394
- Were you ever a kid?
- No.

00:20.396 --> 00:24.641
...as they pit bike against car
for the ultimate eco-challenge.

00:24.643 --> 00:26.580
We're just getting started, too.

00:26.582 --> 00:28.018
Gonna be awesome!

00:28.020 --> 00:29.452
Meanwhile...

00:30.890 --> 00:32.256
...Kari, Tory, and Grant...

00:32.259 --> 00:33.695
Come here often?

00:33.697 --> 00:37.132
...raid the arsenal
for an explosive filmic fable...

00:37.134 --> 00:38.902
You're John Malkovich.
You don't get any hair.

00:38.904 --> 00:41.908
...and unleash the first RPG

00:41.910 --> 00:43.610
in MythBusters history...

00:43.612 --> 00:45.146
Whoa.

00:45.148 --> 00:46.883
...to find out if a bullet

00:46.885 --> 00:49.288
can beat a rocket-propelled grenade.

00:53.263 --> 00:54.396
Mackerel!

00:57.002 --> 00:58.703
Who are the MythBusters?

01:00.172 --> 01:01.442
Adam Savage...

01:01.444 --> 01:04.245
Working on these machines
is great for my skin!

01:04.248 --> 01:07.217
- ...and Jamie Hyneman.
- Are you done screwing around?

01:07.219 --> 01:10.789
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:10.791 --> 01:13.160
Together with Kari Byron...

01:13.162 --> 01:16.364
- Fire!
- ...Tory Belleci...

01:16.366 --> 01:17.833
You ready to get your head cut off?

01:17.835 --> 01:19.201
...and Grant Imahara.

01:19.203 --> 01:20.535
Save yourselves.

01:20.537 --> 01:22.739
They don't just tell the myths.

01:22.741 --> 01:25.542
They put them to the test.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.544

01:36.586 --> 01:38.020
Jamie, you're a fan
of motorcycles, right?

01:38.022 --> 01:40.523
- Ever since I was 16.
- Really?

01:40.525 --> 01:42.559
They've <i>had</i> motorcycles that long?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.562
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:44.564 --> 01:47.266
There is a trend, apparently,
going on where people,

01:47.268 --> 01:49.101
including fans of "MythBusters,"

01:49.103 --> 01:51.604
are trading in their cars
and driving motorcycles instead

01:51.606 --> 01:53.007
because they believe

01:53.009 --> 01:55.176
that's the more
environmentally friendly choice.

01:55.178 --> 01:56.745
And what's their logic?

01:56.747 --> 01:58.447
Their logic is simply
that because motorcycles

01:58.449 --> 02:00.115
are generally
more fuel-efficient than cars,

02:00.117 --> 02:01.383
they burn less gas,

02:01.385 --> 02:02.851
and thus they must be better
for the environment.

02:02.853 --> 02:04.253
Sounds sensible.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.688
But there are people that say
not only is that not true,

02:06.690 --> 02:09.958
they claim that motorcycles
pollute far worse than cars.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.460
Well, that sounds like something
we need to investigate.

02:12.462 --> 02:13.661
I totally agree.

02:14.697 --> 02:18.432
There's no doubt both cars
and bikes produce gases

02:18.434 --> 02:20.568
that can be harmful to the environment.

02:20.570 --> 02:23.872
And supposedly being smaller
and using less fuel

02:23.874 --> 02:26.208
means that bikes produce less.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.344
So, is there fuel to this fire?

02:28.346 --> 02:32.482
Are motorcycles
a greener machine than cars?

02:32.484 --> 02:34.986
Well, clearly, this involves

02:34.988 --> 02:37.055
getting a bunch of different
cars and motorcycles,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.223
testing them, and comparing
the results, right?

02:39.225 --> 02:40.525
Right, but which ones?

02:40.527 --> 02:41.893
I mean, there's tens of thousands

02:41.895 --> 02:42.994
of makes and models of each.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.229
What do we choose?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.531
Well, why don't we get
some of the most popular models

02:46.533 --> 02:47.832
of the last three decades?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.501
A representative sample, right...

02:49.503 --> 02:51.403
some cars and bikes from the '80s,

02:51.405 --> 02:52.804
the '90s, and the naughties.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.506
The naughties are 2000 till 2010.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.108
That sounds like
a perfect way to do this.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.543
Well, let's get our hands dirty.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.711
Okay. Wa-cha!

02:59.713 --> 03:01.145
Whoa. Where are we?

03:01.147 --> 03:03.348
This will be our base of operations.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.017
Let's walk you through the particulars.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.958
These are our test cars.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.961
We've got a car from the '80s,
a car from the '90s,

03:13.963 --> 03:15.229
and a car from the naughties.

03:15.231 --> 03:17.031
We've also got some motorcycles.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.833
We've got one from the '80s...

03:18.835 --> 03:20.535
one from the '90s...

03:20.537 --> 03:22.304
and one from the naughties.

03:22.306 --> 03:24.340
We've chosen them
based on their popularity

03:24.342 --> 03:26.542
within their respective decades.

03:26.544 --> 03:29.045
There is literally nothing fancy

03:29.047 --> 03:31.081
about the route we'll be driving today...

03:31.083 --> 03:33.417
no tricky maneuvers,
no extreme road conditions.

03:33.419 --> 03:36.487
It is simply a 30-minute drive
spread out over 20 miles

03:36.489 --> 03:41.627
and split 75% freeway driving
and 25% city driving.

03:41.629 --> 03:44.196
So, how are we gonna measure
our emissions?

03:44.198 --> 03:46.299
Well, that's where these guys come in.

03:46.301 --> 03:48.168
They're from the
Clean-Air Technologies Division

03:48.170 --> 03:50.504
of Global MRV,

03:50.506 --> 03:52.673
and they've brought with them
something called the PEMS,

03:52.675 --> 03:54.776
or Portable Emissions Measuring System.

03:54.778 --> 03:57.712
And basically, you know when you
take your car in to get it smogged?

03:57.714 --> 04:00.982
Well, that's what the PEMS does,
except it's more accurate,

04:00.984 --> 04:02.384
and it's real world,

04:02.386 --> 04:04.119
because you put it in the vehicle,

04:04.121 --> 04:05.687
you stick a probe in the exhaust,

04:05.689 --> 04:07.423
you hook it up to the engine,

04:07.425 --> 04:10.292
and you drive the car or the
motorcycle around for a while.

04:10.294 --> 04:12.361
And voilà... instant data.

04:12.363 --> 04:14.396
The numbers we get
should be precise enough

04:14.398 --> 04:16.399
to allow us to call
whether the motorcycles

04:16.401 --> 04:18.300
or the cars are better
for the environment.

04:19.435 --> 04:22.204
And with six vehicles,
that's a lot of driving.

04:22.206 --> 04:24.407
- I'm ready.
- All right, let's do this.

04:24.409 --> 04:25.841
All right, here we go.

04:25.843 --> 04:29.011
But thanks to the
wonders of non-linear editing...

04:29.013 --> 04:31.447
Okay, this is bike versus car.

04:31.449 --> 04:33.349
...the 30-minute test for the '80s...

04:33.351 --> 04:37.053
'80s pollution test in 3...

04:37.055 --> 04:38.721
- ...'90s...
- ...2...

04:38.723 --> 04:41.591
- ...and naughties...
- ...1... go!

04:41.593 --> 04:43.659
...can take place simultaneously.

04:43.661 --> 04:44.827
And we're off.

04:47.564 --> 04:51.332
A left turn takes us
into the neighborhood,

04:51.334 --> 04:53.701
where we can do some city driving.

04:53.703 --> 04:55.535
Jamie's keeping up nicely.

04:55.537 --> 04:57.371
Everyone's going roughly the same speed.

04:57.373 --> 04:59.105
Test is going perfect.

04:59.107 --> 05:01.641
Everything is going perfectly.

05:01.643 --> 05:05.044
And Adam's running commentary
gives us a very special insight...

05:06.214 --> 05:07.513
Ooh, I just burped,

05:07.515 --> 05:10.550
and tasted a little bit
of my lunch... enchiladas.

05:10.552 --> 05:13.752
...as the guys gather their data.

05:13.754 --> 05:16.955
I must say, I never quite
understood the dogs-in-sweaters thing.

05:16.957 --> 05:20.826
I mean, they're cute as blazes,
but I like petting my dog.

05:20.828 --> 05:22.328
I don't like petting a sweater.

05:22.330 --> 05:24.697
I'm really glad we had this time alone

05:24.699 --> 05:26.433
that we can talk.

05:28.237 --> 05:31.505
After a few minutes of city driving,

05:31.507 --> 05:33.674
the freeway portion of the testing begins.

05:51.592 --> 05:54.327

30 minutes at each vehicle,

05:54.329 --> 05:55.728
the testing comes to a close,

05:55.730 --> 05:58.297
and Adam finishes how he began.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.297
Thank you. Thank you very much.

06:30.299 --> 06:32.866
After a full day of driving,
we've done three runs

06:32.868 --> 06:34.367
with six vehicles

06:34.369 --> 06:37.470
and collected 24 separate points of data.

06:37.472 --> 06:39.672
Home sweet home.

06:39.674 --> 06:41.274
There we go.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.043
- So, that's it?
- Yeah.

06:44.145 --> 06:46.213
It's time to head back to
the shop and see what it means.

06:52.354 --> 06:55.857
Next up, the guys are seeing red
with an explosive myth.

06:57.662 --> 06:58.994
You're gonna love this.

06:58.996 --> 07:00.596
Why?

07:00.598 --> 07:02.131
Because after 180 or so episodes,

07:02.133 --> 07:05.635
we've finally found an excuse
to use a rocket launcher.

07:05.637 --> 07:07.336
Yes! What are we testing?

07:07.338 --> 07:08.671
This one comes from the movie "Red"...

07:08.673 --> 07:10.005
"Retired and Extremely Dangerous."

07:10.007 --> 07:12.374
Okay, here's the scene.
There's a standoff.

07:12.376 --> 07:14.042
Our hero has a revolver,

07:14.044 --> 07:17.478
and our villain has
a rocket-propelled grenade.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.181
They both fire, and the bullet
and the RPG meet in midair.

07:20.183 --> 07:23.617
The bullet triggers the RPG,
causing a huge explosion,

07:23.619 --> 07:25.286
killing the villain,

07:25.288 --> 07:27.021
and the hero walks away unscathed.

07:27.023 --> 07:29.590
So, that's two
rocket-propelled grenade myths

07:29.592 --> 07:31.392
for the price of one.

07:31.394 --> 07:33.093
Will the bullet trigger the warhead?

07:33.095 --> 07:34.628
And when it explodes,

07:34.630 --> 07:36.931
would it really be "bye-bye, rocketeer,"

07:36.933 --> 07:40.300
with only the bad gal going up in flames?

07:40.302 --> 07:41.735
So, where to start?

07:41.737 --> 07:43.336
All right, two myths, one scene.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.671
Now, the first one is,

07:44.673 --> 07:47.239
can you set off a round
from an RPG using a bullet?

07:47.241 --> 07:49.208
Well, to begin with,
I think we need to match

07:49.210 --> 07:51.677
both the gun and the
rocket launcher from the movie.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.711
Then we point them
at each other and fire.

07:53.713 --> 07:54.946
Simple, right?

07:54.948 --> 07:57.515
Okay, besides being
a logistical nightmare,

07:57.517 --> 08:00.251
you can't shoot
a rocket launcher in California.

08:00.253 --> 08:02.653
But I know a place we can.

08:02.655 --> 08:07.559
Luckily, the team have
friends in high-explosive places,

08:07.561 --> 08:12.398
so they head to the
MythBusters rocketeering H.Q.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.635
To test the myth
of our RPG handgun face-off,

08:15.637 --> 08:18.004
we've come to one
of our favorites places.

08:18.006 --> 08:20.807
New Mexico Tech sort of
feels like a second home.

08:20.809 --> 08:21.942
Why do we love this place so much?

08:26.848 --> 08:30.017
Well, they have 40 square miles
of testing facility

08:30.019 --> 08:31.985
where they have gun ranges
and bomb sites.

08:31.987 --> 08:33.620
How can it get any better than that?

08:35.224 --> 08:37.823
Well, by throwing in
a license to fire these.

08:38.926 --> 08:41.995
So, for this myth, we have
three questions we need to ask.

08:41.996 --> 08:44.298
One, how does an RPG work?

08:44.300 --> 08:46.500
Which end does the rocket go in?

08:46.502 --> 08:50.337
Two, what happens when an RPG
and a bullet meet midair?

08:50.339 --> 08:53.841
And three, when they do meet
and the explosion goes off,

08:53.843 --> 08:55.242
who survives?

08:55.244 --> 08:58.145
And question one... how does it work?...

08:58.147 --> 09:02.617
calls for a little RPG 101
with John Myrkle.

09:02.619 --> 09:05.954
John, we've fired a lot of guns
on the show but never an RPG.

09:05.956 --> 09:07.655
Could you fill me in
on the basic components?

09:07.657 --> 09:09.591
Okay, this is the launcher.
It's pretty simple.

09:09.593 --> 09:11.827
It's basically a bunch
of metal tubes welded together.

09:11.829 --> 09:13.195
And this is the rocket.

09:13.197 --> 09:15.564
So, when it fires, it kicks
the RPG out of the tube,

09:15.566 --> 09:16.699
and partway to the target,

09:16.701 --> 09:18.534
the rocket motor lights
and makes it accelerate.

09:18.536 --> 09:20.669
And what actually causes the fuse to arm?

09:20.671 --> 09:21.937
Setback. "G" forces.

09:21.939 --> 09:23.505
When it comes out of the tube,

09:23.507 --> 09:25.607
it goes from zero
to 140 meters per second

09:25.609 --> 09:27.008
in about 6 milliseconds.

09:27.010 --> 09:28.944
So it's experiencing a lot of G's.

09:28.946 --> 09:34.549
It's time for the practical demo
of exactly how the RPG works.

09:34.551 --> 09:36.217
All right, you guys realize

09:36.219 --> 09:39.153
this is the first time
in the history of "MythBusters"

09:39.155 --> 09:40.988
that we've ever shot an RPG.

09:40.990 --> 09:44.259
All right, this is RPG versus trailer

09:44.261 --> 09:45.794
just to see what it does.

09:46.797 --> 09:52.702
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

09:54.940 --> 09:57.007
- What?!
- It's gone.

09:57.009 --> 09:58.341
The trailer's completely gone.

09:58.343 --> 09:59.910
That was so fast!

09:59.912 --> 10:02.145
That was so much more energetic
than I thought.

10:05.149 --> 10:07.451
That didn't look anything
like you see in the movies!

10:07.453 --> 10:08.852
That was, like, bang, bang!

10:10.588 --> 10:12.388
Let's check the wreckage.

10:12.390 --> 10:13.557
Yeah, right.

10:15.627 --> 10:19.363
Outside, they find
a trail of RPG devastation,

10:19.365 --> 10:23.201
or should that be
an RPG-devastated trailer?

10:23.203 --> 10:27.239
Wow, that is a scary amount of
destructive force right there.

10:27.241 --> 10:29.709
Well, now we know how an RPG works.

10:29.711 --> 10:34.181
Yep, they couldn't have asked
for a better demonstration.

10:34.183 --> 10:36.917
After looking at
the high speed of the trailer,

10:36.919 --> 10:38.185
we noticed one thing.

10:38.187 --> 10:41.155
After the trailer exploded,
we saw hot molten copper

10:41.157 --> 10:43.290
continue on and actually burn holes

10:43.292 --> 10:45.025
into the steel armor behind it.

10:45.027 --> 10:46.759
The reason being is because an RPG

10:46.761 --> 10:48.294
isn't like a typical grenade

10:48.296 --> 10:51.130
that has an explosive charge
that throws shrapnel.

10:51.132 --> 10:53.766
It actually has an inverted copper cone

10:53.768 --> 10:55.600
that is surrounded by a shaped charge,

10:55.602 --> 10:58.370
and when that hits the target,
the charge goes off

10:58.372 --> 11:00.905
and actually pushes that copper out

11:00.907 --> 11:05.410
into a hot molten slug of copper
that burns through steel.

11:05.412 --> 11:08.046
So, not only is the RPG explosion

11:08.048 --> 11:09.648
nothing like the movie,

11:09.650 --> 11:13.085
it also throws forward
a molten copper surprise,

11:13.087 --> 11:15.855
which doesn't bode well for the hero.

11:15.857 --> 11:18.291
Now we need to see what happens
when a bullet meets an RPG.

11:18.293 --> 11:21.261
The hard part is gonna be
getting those two to match up.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.397
- Let's get to work.
- That was incredible.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:35.342 --> 11:36.575
After the break...

11:36.577 --> 11:38.009
So, it's kind of like soap on a rope

11:38.011 --> 11:39.277
but a little bit more dangerous.

11:39.279 --> 11:40.779
Yeah, a lot more power.

11:40.781 --> 11:43.849
...it's the RPG versus bullet smackdown.

11:50.671 --> 11:52.840
The MythBusters
have been behind the wheel

11:52.842 --> 11:54.375
and in the saddle

11:54.377 --> 11:57.879
to find out which is greener,
the car or the bike.

11:57.881 --> 12:00.781
And, finally, the data is in.

12:00.783 --> 12:05.187
So, after some swift consulting,
equating, and calculating,

12:05.189 --> 12:08.490
the guys have the emissions verdict.

12:08.492 --> 12:09.825
After running the numbers

12:09.827 --> 12:12.160
and looking at the outputs
of pollutant gases

12:12.162 --> 12:13.595
from all the vehicles

12:13.597 --> 12:16.598
and getting some expert analysis
from professor Kent Johnson

12:16.600 --> 12:18.500
of the University of California
Riverside,

12:18.502 --> 12:21.036
we came up with some surprising results.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.871
First up in the MythBusters

12:22.873 --> 12:26.174
motorcycle versus car
data crunch is fuel efficiency.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.510
Across all of the vehicles,
the results were consistent.

12:29.512 --> 12:32.113
Motorcycles use less fuel than cars.

12:32.115 --> 12:33.381
Which makes sense.

12:33.383 --> 12:35.016
Motorcycles are lighter than cars,

12:35.018 --> 12:37.319
and thus they require less energy
to push themselves forward.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.555
And you'd think that using less fuel

12:39.557 --> 12:41.157
would make them better
for the environment.

12:41.159 --> 12:42.591
But you'd be wrong.

12:42.593 --> 12:44.060
From an emissions standpoint,

12:44.062 --> 12:46.395
let's take a look at
the most populous of the gases

12:46.397 --> 12:48.531
that these vehicles put out...
carbon dioxide.

12:48.533 --> 12:49.699
It's nasty.

12:49.701 --> 12:50.900
It's a greenhouse gas,

12:50.902 --> 12:52.935
so it contributes to global warming.

12:52.937 --> 12:55.070
And it makes up 90% of the emissions

12:55.072 --> 12:57.039
of an internal combustion engine.

12:57.041 --> 13:00.410
And, because it's a direct
by-product of burning fuel,

13:00.412 --> 13:02.645
motorcycles, which burn less fuel,

13:02.647 --> 13:06.182
consistently produce less
carbon dioxide than cars.

13:06.184 --> 13:08.451
But the other pollutant gases we measured

13:08.453 --> 13:10.086
tell a totally different story.

13:10.088 --> 13:12.755
Hydrocarbons, for example, cause smog,

13:12.757 --> 13:16.092
cancer, asthma, emphysema,
and a host of other nasties,

13:16.094 --> 13:18.895
and motorcycles produce
far more than cars.

13:18.897 --> 13:21.398
Oxides of nitrogen...
responsible for smog,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.767
lung ailments, and acid rain.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.704
Motorcycles produced
up to 3,200% more than cars.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.173
And carbon monoxide is an air pollutant

13:30.175 --> 13:31.941
and poisonous for animals to breathe.

13:31.943 --> 13:36.612
Well, motorcycles produce
up to 8,000% more than cars.

13:36.614 --> 13:38.214
In summary, while we found
that motorcycles

13:38.216 --> 13:40.049
were more fuel-efficient than cars

13:40.051 --> 13:42.585
and put out a lot less carbon dioxide,

13:42.587 --> 13:44.354
the amount of polluting gases
they put out

13:44.356 --> 13:45.855
was vastly worse.

13:45.857 --> 13:48.925
This myth is about someone that
traded the car for a motorcycle

13:48.927 --> 13:51.126
because they believed it was
better for the environment.

13:51.128 --> 13:54.063
And they were wrong.
At best, it's a wash.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.632
Motorcycles are just as bad
for the environment as cars.

13:56.634 --> 13:58.901
At worst, they're far worse.

13:58.903 --> 14:01.137
Yep, the data doesn't lie.

14:01.139 --> 14:02.404
The cars are cleaner,

14:02.406 --> 14:05.107
but bikes and MythBusters go way back,

14:05.109 --> 14:06.542
and they're not done yet.

14:07.678 --> 14:11.747
By combining Hyneman ingenuity
with Savage savvy,

14:11.749 --> 14:14.049
they're taking this myth to the max.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.917
Now, that is a cool-looking design.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.952
Can they put bikes back on track

14:17.954 --> 14:21.722
by creating the ultimate
clean, green machine?

14:21.724 --> 14:23.624
It's starting to look sexy.

14:27.495 --> 14:31.698
KTG are taking on an RPG.

14:33.267 --> 14:37.537
And it's got nothing to do
with role playing.

14:37.539 --> 14:40.340
In this movie myth,
the villain is taken out

14:40.342 --> 14:42.676
by their own rocket-propelled grenade

14:42.678 --> 14:45.346
all because of a well-timed bullet.

14:45.348 --> 14:48.483
So far, we've seen what happens
when an RPG hits a trailer,

14:48.485 --> 14:51.520
and it turns out, it's not
looking so good for the myth,

14:51.522 --> 14:53.455
because once an RPG detonates,

14:53.457 --> 14:56.125
it fires a stream of molten copper

14:56.127 --> 14:58.995
through and beyond the target.

14:58.997 --> 15:02.166
But you know what? This is "MythBusters".
We can't give up here.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.567
What we want to look at next

15:03.569 --> 15:05.937
is what happens
when a bullet meets an RPG.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.239
Can it even trigger?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.608
Indeed, but getting a tiny bullet

15:10.610 --> 15:13.377
to hit the warhead <i>on</i> the head is tricky.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.880
Luckily, by joining forces with NMT,

15:16.882 --> 15:18.515
they've come up with a solution.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.684
All right, Leonard, you built this system.
Tell me a little bit about it.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.385
Well, this was actually designed, Tory,

15:22.387 --> 15:24.454
from friends of ours
up in Huntsville, Alabama...

15:24.456 --> 15:26.155
ArTec... and they call it
"rocket on a rope".

15:26.157 --> 15:27.556
So, it's kind of like soap on a rope

15:27.558 --> 15:29.058
but a little bit more dangerous.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.726
Yeah, a lot more power.

15:30.728 --> 15:34.197
More powerful and more deadly.
And here's why.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.899
Now, obviously, this isn't a real RPG.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.868
This is an inert one,
'cause we're not crazy.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.071
Right here is our launcher.
It's a steel tube.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.174
The RPG will go into that.

15:42.176 --> 15:43.909
Right here is where
our firing pin will be.

15:43.911 --> 15:46.945
Once that starts, pressure
will build up inside this pipe,

15:46.947 --> 15:49.615
and it'll push our rocket on the sled

15:49.617 --> 15:52.618
down these lines towards our gun.

15:52.620 --> 15:56.088
That quick change in
acceleration arms the warhead,

15:56.090 --> 15:57.756
and it travels down this line,

15:57.758 --> 15:59.759
which is tensioned at 3,000 pounds.

15:59.761 --> 16:01.093
So it can handle the rocket

16:01.095 --> 16:02.962
and keep it on a level and straight path.

16:02.964 --> 16:04.496
When that sustainer motor kicks in,

16:04.498 --> 16:06.098
that's when we really start cooking.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.100
Now, at some point along the line,

16:08.102 --> 16:10.236
the RPG will actually hit a trip wire

16:10.238 --> 16:12.138
that will activate our gun.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.273
Now, I know this doesn't look
like the gun in the movie,

16:14.275 --> 16:15.741
but it does exactly the same thing.

16:15.743 --> 16:18.844
And the bullet, which is the
same caliber as in the movie,

16:18.846 --> 16:21.747
will come firing out of here,
right into the tip of the RPG.

16:21.749 --> 16:25.751
Then we'll finally find out what
happens when bullet meets RPG.

16:25.753 --> 16:30.122
With their ingenious
"rocket on a rope" rig primed

16:30.124 --> 16:31.856
and the gun loaded,

16:31.858 --> 16:34.293
it's time to hunker in the bunker.

16:35.596 --> 16:38.831
- Okay, RPG versus bullet.
- Go for launch.

16:38.833 --> 16:43.903
All right, here we go. In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.306
Whoa!

16:48.642 --> 16:51.144
Do you think maybe the bullet disabled it?

16:51.146 --> 16:52.812
- I don't know. High speed...
- Let's go look at the high speed.

16:52.814 --> 16:54.414
Check the high speed.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.550
It all happened in the blink of an eye.

16:56.552 --> 17:01.756
But it does seem like there was
a trip up with the trip wire.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.262
For our first test,

17:07.263 --> 17:09.464
we were not able to hit
the RPG with the bullet,

17:09.465 --> 17:11.566
and there was a couple
of reasons for that.

17:11.568 --> 17:13.434
One, the lines were not tight enough.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.603
So, as the rocket came down the line,

17:15.605 --> 17:16.738
it was bouncing around.

17:16.740 --> 17:18.271
By the time it got to the bullet,

17:18.273 --> 17:20.973
it was actually out of line
with the barrel of the gun.

17:20.976 --> 17:23.142
Not only that, the bullet didn't even fire.

17:23.144 --> 17:25.845
The trigger was not sensitive enough.

17:25.847 --> 17:27.213
So, we've made some adjustments.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.149
We've put more tension on the line.

17:29.151 --> 17:30.917
That way, that'll keep
that rocket stable,

17:30.919 --> 17:32.920
and we have a more sensitive trigger.

17:32.922 --> 17:34.655
So that way, by the time
the rocket gets to the barrel,

17:34.657 --> 17:36.090
the gun will fire.

17:36.092 --> 17:37.658
And then, finally, we'll find out,

17:37.660 --> 17:40.228
will an RPG get set off by a bullet?

17:40.230 --> 17:43.097
With the rig adjusted
and a new warhead loaded,

17:43.099 --> 17:46.434
it's back underground for round two.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.403
I think it's time for another shot.

17:48.405 --> 17:49.805
All right, here we go.

17:49.807 --> 17:54.709
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.613
Wow. It definitely exploded.

17:59.615 --> 18:01.282
I don't know if it was
because of the bullet.

18:04.885 --> 18:07.086
- Hard to tell.
- Let's look at the high speed.

18:07.088 --> 18:08.454
Oh, this is crazy!

18:08.456 --> 18:11.457
Crazy with a capital "C".

18:13.060 --> 18:17.197
And it looks like they've gotten
bullet versus RPG success.

18:17.199 --> 18:19.800
Hits the trip wire.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.468
It works!

18:22.839 --> 18:25.339
The bullet can set off an RPG!

18:25.341 --> 18:28.009
Dude, that's amazing!

18:28.011 --> 18:30.345
All right, so that part
of the myth is confirmed.

18:30.347 --> 18:32.614
Amazing and confirmed

18:32.616 --> 18:35.850
and all down to an incredible rig.

18:35.852 --> 18:40.187
Now, to nail down who actually
lives and who dies in this myth,

18:40.189 --> 18:41.788
we've got to do a few things.

18:41.790 --> 18:43.857
We've got to find out how fast
the bullet travels,

18:43.859 --> 18:46.125
how fast the RPG travels,

18:46.127 --> 18:47.593
and then we can figure out

18:47.595 --> 18:49.595
where, in the 80 feet between
the good guy and the bad guy,

18:49.597 --> 18:50.795
they would meet.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.397
So that means
we need to get some bullets,

18:52.399 --> 18:55.199
we need to get some RPGs,
and we can go shootin'.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.038
So, for the oxides of nitrogen,
the hydrocarbons,

19:01.040 --> 19:02.373
and the carbon monoxide,

19:02.375 --> 19:04.342
the bikes put out more pollution
than the cars,

19:04.344 --> 19:07.078
but, somehow, I don't feel like
you're done with this story.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.880
No, I'm not, and here's why.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.950
Ultimately, the amount of pollution
that comes out of a bike

19:11.952 --> 19:14.385
has to be related to the amount
of fuel that goes into it.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.955
And while it's true
that bikes are lighter

19:16.957 --> 19:19.725
and smaller than cars
and so they use less fuel,

19:19.727 --> 19:22.228
they'd use even less
if they more aerodynamic.

19:22.230 --> 19:23.963
Right. The fact is that bikes

19:23.965 --> 19:25.899
are totally aerodynamically inefficient.

19:25.901 --> 19:28.502
That upright rider presents
a huge block to the wind.

19:28.504 --> 19:31.972
They're not designed like cars
to slip through the air.

19:31.974 --> 19:34.207
Exactly, and so what I'm wondering is,

19:34.209 --> 19:36.409
if we made a bike super streamlined,

19:36.411 --> 19:38.878
could we reduce its fuel usage
to such a degree

19:38.880 --> 19:40.612
that it would actually beat

19:40.614 --> 19:42.413
the fuel-pollution standards of cars?

19:42.415 --> 19:44.716
You want to build
a super-streamlined bike

19:44.718 --> 19:46.084
and put it to the test.

19:46.086 --> 19:48.385
- I do.
- I love it. Let's do it.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.721
The plan is to create

19:50.723 --> 19:52.256
an aerodynamically efficient bike.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.827
And for that, the MythBusters
fire up the old gray cells

19:55.829 --> 19:57.962
for one heck of a brainstorm.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.599
So, we're making one of those

20:01.601 --> 20:03.234
super aerodynamically efficient.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.903
How do we do it?

20:04.905 --> 20:06.838
Well, it's got to be some kind of a shell.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.972
Mm-hmm.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.774
And it's got to be lightweight

20:09.776 --> 20:12.243
and pretty much got to
cover the whole thing.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.379
In this concept cyclone...

20:14.381 --> 20:17.949
Something like a teardrop
with the bike in the middle.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.651
...a whole load of ideas
are thrown up in the air.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.321
I was thinking more like a tuna,

20:23.323 --> 20:25.123
where the tip can be
a little bit more pointed.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.425
It's kind of like an igloo.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.794
What if this thing was like a big sphere?

20:29.796 --> 20:32.196
And just like lightning...

20:32.198 --> 20:35.233
one idea strikes them
as the best way to go...

20:35.235 --> 20:36.801
If these are steel...

20:36.803 --> 20:38.335
- Like ribs.
- Yeah.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.272
Secure it, and then you cut out
an access-port-sized door,

20:41.274 --> 20:42.807
these would be covered by heat-shrink.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.976
...and have not just a design
but a plan, too.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.012
Now, that is a cool-looking design.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.114
I've never seen
anything like that before.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.183
If we did this and we did this
in a tubular steel,

20:53.185 --> 20:55.385
it's a really nice
divide-and-conquer design.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.020
- I love it.
- Let's do it.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.455
Okay.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.057
After a tremendous amount
of back and forth,

21:01.059 --> 21:04.227
we have a plan, and that is it.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.563
With a little bit of bent tube steel,

21:06.565 --> 21:09.766
some heat-shrink plastic,
and a couple of dozen hours,

21:09.768 --> 21:11.835
I think we'll have our bike fairing.

21:11.837 --> 21:12.869
Later...

21:12.871 --> 21:14.505
Whoa!

21:14.507 --> 21:15.640
That was intense.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.808
But first...

21:22.916 --> 21:27.519
♪ I'm followed by Jamie
and following a police car ♪

21:27.521 --> 21:30.523
♪ to gather the pollution data ♪

21:30.525 --> 21:32.992
It seems that cars have the edge on bikes

21:32.994 --> 21:34.961
when it comes to being green.

21:34.963 --> 21:37.565
We found that motorcycles
were more fuel-efficient than cars

21:37.567 --> 21:40.034
and put out a lot less carbon dioxide.

21:40.036 --> 21:43.739
The amount of polluting gases
they put out was vastly worse.

21:43.741 --> 21:47.375
So, now the guys are creating
a super-streamlined motorcycle

21:47.377 --> 21:51.746
to increase its fuel efficiency
and minimize its emissions.

21:51.748 --> 21:54.950
Now, a lot of bikes
normally have fairings on them,

21:54.952 --> 21:57.785
which are plastic cowlings that
cover the front portion of the bike

21:57.787 --> 21:59.687
to reduce wind resistance.

21:59.689 --> 22:02.623
In our case, we're gonna get
considerably more involved,

22:02.625 --> 22:04.592
however, and we're gonna build a fairing

22:04.594 --> 22:08.330
that covers the entire bike,
its passenger included.

22:08.332 --> 22:09.698
A little more crouchy than that.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.134
This device will cocoon the cyclist inside,

22:12.136 --> 22:14.637
making it more aerodynamic, greener,

22:14.639 --> 22:17.340
and eco-competition for the car.

22:17.342 --> 22:18.875
This is our stripped-down bike,

22:18.877 --> 22:20.777
and very soon, a bunch of steel like this

22:20.779 --> 22:22.646
is gonna make the frame for our fairing.

22:22.648 --> 22:24.181
And the frame is gonna be
comprised of two parts.

22:24.183 --> 22:26.851
One... this large, overarching circle,

22:26.853 --> 22:28.652
which Jamie is going to ring-roll,

22:28.654 --> 22:31.655
and a bunch of horizontal ellipses,

22:31.657 --> 22:34.359
which I'm going to hand-bend
with a conduit bender.

22:35.327 --> 22:38.129
Getting the steel frame perfect is crucial,

22:38.131 --> 22:41.365
as the design literally hangs off of it.

22:41.367 --> 22:44.335
I love bending metal.

22:44.337 --> 22:46.370
Soon, what starts out

22:46.372 --> 22:47.905
as a series of bent steel rods...

22:49.808 --> 22:53.978
...is welded together to become
one half of the fairing.

22:55.382 --> 22:57.449
Wow.

22:57.451 --> 22:59.184
That is a pretty thing.

22:59.186 --> 23:00.386
It is, isn't it?

23:01.989 --> 23:04.190
I don't care what it's for.
It's just plain lovely.

23:04.192 --> 23:05.791
Yeah, let's make a whole bunch of them.

23:05.793 --> 23:09.195
A little more measuring,
welding, and bending,

23:09.197 --> 23:13.032
and they've got what looks like
a giant hamster ball.

23:13.034 --> 23:15.635
That is frickin' sexy, man.

23:15.637 --> 23:17.502
More surface area, but it's smoother.

23:17.504 --> 23:18.737
Oh, yeah, totally.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.041
With the sphere complete,

23:23.043 --> 23:24.810
they cut out the part
where the bike will go.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.981
I like it.

23:28.983 --> 23:31.117
When I was a kid, I would've
killed for one of these.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.018
- Were you ever a kid?
- No.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.787
And since the bike fits snugly,

23:34.789 --> 23:38.558
it's time for the comet to get its tail.

23:40.729 --> 23:42.095
How about that?

23:42.097 --> 23:43.630
That is friggin' awesome.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.666
It's starting to look sexy.

23:45.668 --> 23:47.935
It's kind of different, you know?

23:48.971 --> 23:50.471
A perfect teardrop,

23:50.473 --> 23:52.206
but there's just one more thing

23:52.208 --> 23:54.575
to complete their aerodynamic design.

23:54.577 --> 23:56.610
So, this frame that we've
spent all this time building

23:56.612 --> 23:58.712
isn't what makes this bike
more aerodynamic.

23:58.714 --> 24:00.948
It's actually the skin
we put on top of this frame

24:00.950 --> 24:04.951
that will do all of that work,
and this is our skin.

24:04.953 --> 24:09.356
It is a roughly clear plastic
that shrinks when you heat it.

24:09.358 --> 24:11.224
So, we're going to put it all
over this frame.

24:14.228 --> 24:16.163
Then we're going to
heat it with a blow torch

24:16.165 --> 24:18.798
until it's drum-tight.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.367
And that ought to make this

24:20.369 --> 24:22.769
the aerodynamic, fuel-efficient
bike of our dreams.

24:22.771 --> 24:25.339
An aerodynamic bike of their dreams

24:25.341 --> 24:28.543
and all by reducing
a little thing called drag.

24:28.545 --> 24:32.347
We know that the motorcycle
is less aerodynamic than a car,

24:32.349 --> 24:34.482
and that is because of drag.

24:34.484 --> 24:37.686
The best way to visualize drag
is to take a look at this clip.

24:37.688 --> 24:39.754
You see the ink
floating behind the vehicle?

24:39.756 --> 24:42.724
That is a low-pressure bubble of air

24:42.726 --> 24:45.593
that the vehicle has to drag around

24:45.595 --> 24:47.962
because it's not properly aerodynamic.

24:47.964 --> 24:50.031
Our thinking is that the smooth front

24:50.033 --> 24:51.333
and sharp tail of our fairing

24:51.335 --> 24:53.735
will allow the motorcycle
to slice through the air,

24:53.737 --> 24:56.971
spending less of its energy
driving and saving fuel.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.873
If we're able to save enough fuel,

24:58.875 --> 25:01.576
the emissions might finally dip
below that of the cars.

25:03.178 --> 25:04.745
That's looking great, isn't it?

25:04.747 --> 25:06.681
Yeah, it is. It's cooling down right now.

25:06.683 --> 25:08.649
- That's when it shrinks, huh?
- Yeah.

25:08.651 --> 25:11.752
And in no time at all,
the fairing is skinned.

25:15.858 --> 25:18.693
That is really, really pretty.

25:18.695 --> 25:21.596
That just looks frickin' awesome.

25:24.968 --> 25:27.002
That was worth the wait.

25:27.004 --> 25:28.703
The fairing is finally complete,

25:28.705 --> 25:31.073
and just as guys anticipated,

25:31.075 --> 25:34.309
the bike looks like a teardrop
crossed with a comet.

25:36.379 --> 25:38.079
It's like giving birth but in reverse.

25:39.082 --> 25:40.981
Lowering the back hatch now.

25:40.983 --> 25:42.182
Okay.

25:43.519 --> 25:44.685
What do you think?

25:44.687 --> 25:46.654
It's not at all uncomfortable
once you're in here.

25:46.656 --> 25:48.789
That's great.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.425
Not at all uncomfortable,

25:50.427 --> 25:53.428
but it's real test will be on the road.

25:53.430 --> 25:55.096
Coming right up...

25:55.098 --> 25:58.133
it crashed a trailer
and obliterated a bullet,

25:58.135 --> 26:01.503
but how fast can an RPG fly?

26:01.505 --> 26:03.271
Wow. It totally penetrated.

26:03.273 --> 26:04.472
It went all the way through.

26:04.474 --> 26:05.940
That is crazy.

26:13.369 --> 26:15.870
It may seem unlikely...

26:15.872 --> 26:20.408
but the team has proved that
a bullet can trigger an RPG.

26:20.410 --> 26:23.544
Now they need to know where
in the air they would meet.

26:23.546 --> 26:24.845
Ready to do some science?

26:24.847 --> 26:26.447
Oh, you know I am.

26:26.449 --> 26:29.016
Down at the gun range,
first they need to find out

26:29.018 --> 26:31.485
the speed of the speeding bullet.

26:31.487 --> 26:33.255
So, what we are trying to find out

26:33.257 --> 26:35.424
is where, between
the two dueling shooters,

26:35.426 --> 26:38.094
the bullet and the RPG meet.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.697
Now, we've set up a scale 80 feet long

26:40.699 --> 26:43.133
just like two 40-foot truck containers

26:43.135 --> 26:44.735
like the scene in the movie.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.938
So, what we're gonna do
is shoot the gun and the RPG,

26:46.940 --> 26:49.273
measure how fast each of them are going,

26:49.275 --> 26:52.777
then we'll be able to calculate
exactly what point the two meet

26:52.779 --> 26:54.144
and the explosion happens.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.847
And just how far away that explosion is

26:56.849 --> 26:59.751
from the shooter and the rocketeer.

26:59.753 --> 27:01.352
So, here's how
the experiment's gonna work.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.288
We're gonna use the same gun
they had in the movie...

27:03.290 --> 27:05.189
a Smith & Wesson .460.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.359
Has a muzzle velocity
of 2,200 feet per second.

27:07.361 --> 27:09.962
We're gonna fire it
through this piece of foil,

27:09.964 --> 27:11.297
which will start the timer.

27:11.299 --> 27:13.132
The bullet will hit this plate,

27:13.134 --> 27:16.236
firing the switch and stopping
the timing sequence.

27:16.238 --> 27:17.971
We're gonna do it at 40 and 80 feet,

27:17.973 --> 27:19.873
and through that,
we should be able to see

27:19.875 --> 27:22.009
where along the path
the bullet and the RPG meet.

27:22.011 --> 27:25.579
So, first up, Tory's packing the heat...

27:25.581 --> 27:28.516
Dude, this thing's so big,
it looks like a cartoon gun.

27:28.518 --> 27:31.385
...to find out the speed
of the bullet at 40 feet.

27:31.387 --> 27:34.287
All right, this is the speed
of the bullet from 40 feet.

27:39.794 --> 27:41.795
Good shot. Let's go see what you got.

27:41.797 --> 27:43.263
All right, see how fast that went.

27:43.265 --> 27:44.899
Pretty fast.

27:44.901 --> 27:47.501
22 milliseconds, to be precise.

27:48.871 --> 27:53.174
Next, it's Grant's turn
to turn on the firepower.

27:53.176 --> 27:54.576
But I'm not gonna
do this one standing up.

27:54.578 --> 27:56.378
I'm gonna do this one on a rest,

27:56.380 --> 27:58.981
because not only am I not John Malkovich,

27:58.983 --> 28:01.984
but I'm not retired, and I'm
only moderately dangerous.

28:03.487 --> 28:05.789
Okay, this is time of the bullet
from 80 feet.

28:05.791 --> 28:07.624
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

28:09.794 --> 28:11.360
Got it!

28:11.362 --> 28:13.062
See, you're not mildly dangerous.

28:13.064 --> 28:14.730
You're a bad man.

28:14.732 --> 28:17.299
All right, let's see how fast it took.

28:17.301 --> 28:18.767
What do we got?

28:18.769 --> 28:20.535
42 milliseconds.

28:20.537 --> 28:21.936
- Perfect.
- That adds up.

28:21.938 --> 28:23.104
All right.

28:23.106 --> 28:24.739
After a hard day's shootin',

28:24.741 --> 28:26.908
the guys have the bullet's speed.

28:26.910 --> 28:29.210
Now to the second part of the equation...

28:29.212 --> 28:31.378
the rocket-propelled grenade.

28:32.916 --> 28:34.949
It's a good day to be a MythBuster.

28:34.951 --> 28:36.417
Got that right.

28:36.419 --> 28:38.052
So, we know how fast the bullet flies.

28:38.054 --> 28:40.889
Now it's time for us to find out
how fast an RPG goes.

28:40.891 --> 28:42.924
We're gonna take our RPG-7 launcher,

28:42.926 --> 28:45.294
set it up on the test stand,
put our scales behind it...

28:45.296 --> 28:46.662
Aah!

28:46.664 --> 28:47.997
...and plot the data points.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.498
And from that, we'll be able to find out

28:49.500 --> 28:51.600
where the bullet and the RPG
are likely to meet.

28:51.602 --> 28:54.637
And all that means
is setting up the gauges

28:54.639 --> 28:56.139
just as before.

28:57.775 --> 29:00.610
The rocket is primed, and it's firing time.

29:00.612 --> 29:01.945
Okay, here we are.

29:01.947 --> 29:03.347
All right, now we can find out

29:03.349 --> 29:04.982
where the bullet and the rocket meet.

29:04.984 --> 29:08.352
Okay, this is RPG speed test.

29:08.354 --> 29:12.723
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

29:12.725 --> 29:16.226
Whoa!

29:18.829 --> 29:20.830
- You see flash, boom!
- Yeah, you can't see it traveling.

29:20.832 --> 29:22.231
You definitely need the high speed.

29:22.233 --> 29:24.666
Let's go do some calculations.

29:24.668 --> 29:26.234
Yeah, let's do some math.

29:26.236 --> 29:28.470
All right, well, let's use
multiple data points

29:28.472 --> 29:29.838
because there's two stages.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.942
You reach 20 feet in 43 milliseconds,

29:32.944 --> 29:35.178
40 feet in 83.6 milliseconds,

29:35.180 --> 29:37.714
60 feet at 125 milliseconds,

29:37.716 --> 29:41.351
and 80 feet at 161.3 milliseconds.

29:41.353 --> 29:43.587
Okay, so, if we flip this around,

29:43.589 --> 29:46.557
we see that the bullet
and the RPG meet at 64 feet.

29:46.559 --> 29:48.826
So that's 64 feet from the bullet firer

29:48.828 --> 29:50.995
and 16 feet from the RPG firer.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.630
All right, so why don't we set up the RPG

29:52.632 --> 29:54.665
at that point between the two shooters

29:54.667 --> 29:56.266
and see which one of them survives?

29:56.268 --> 29:58.301
If anybody.

29:58.303 --> 30:00.136
Go!

30:00.138 --> 30:02.038
Next, Adam and Jamie take to the street.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.372
Hyneman crossing.

30:03.374 --> 30:06.742
But will their green bike
get the green light?

30:12.226 --> 30:15.662
It's a given that,
if something's aerodynamic,

30:15.664 --> 30:18.098
it'll slice through the air better.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.200
But does making a bike more streamlined

30:21.202 --> 30:23.903
also mean it'll become greener

30:23.905 --> 30:25.672
than its four-wheel counterparts?

30:25.674 --> 30:27.273
We've coned out the Alameda runway,

30:27.275 --> 30:29.275
and it is going to be our closed course

30:29.277 --> 30:30.710
for motorcycle testing today.

30:30.712 --> 30:32.445
And 40.

30:32.447 --> 30:34.547
We're gonna use it to replicate

30:34.549 --> 30:36.716
the exact same conditions
of freeway and city driving

30:36.718 --> 30:38.285
we had for the first round
of vehicle testing.

30:38.287 --> 30:39.920
Jamie's gonna start out on the motorcycle

30:39.922 --> 30:41.521
and do seven laps

30:41.523 --> 30:43.456
all the way down to the end
of the runway and back,

30:43.458 --> 30:45.158
which gives us 15 miles of freeway driving,

30:45.160 --> 30:46.293
just like we want.

30:47.496 --> 30:50.297
This is both the start line...

30:50.299 --> 30:53.600
and the finish line
after a bunch of laps.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.202
Then I've marked out a little city course

30:55.204 --> 30:56.837
of some stop-and-go traffic,

30:56.839 --> 30:59.940
and that Jamie has to do 25 laps of

30:59.942 --> 31:03.644
to give us the 7 1/2 miles
of city driving we need.

31:03.646 --> 31:06.447
And that should give us
a set of comparable numbers.

31:06.449 --> 31:10.184
No city course is complete without signage.

31:10.186 --> 31:11.853
And we've got signage.

31:11.855 --> 31:14.722
Hyneman crossing.

31:14.724 --> 31:18.226
Yep, first is the base line
for the bike without its fairing.

31:18.228 --> 31:19.961
But before Jamie gets on his bike,

31:19.963 --> 31:23.398
why did he choose it
for the beat-the-car test?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.333
The name of the game here
was to find a motorcycle

31:25.335 --> 31:27.168
that is as environmentally friendly

31:27.170 --> 31:29.604
as anything currently available
on the market.

31:29.606 --> 31:32.408
That means it needs to be of
relatively small displacement,

31:32.410 --> 31:34.643
fuel-injected, have a catalytic converter

31:34.645 --> 31:37.780
and any other pollution controls
available on motorcycles

31:37.782 --> 31:39.348
as of this date.

31:39.350 --> 31:41.850
So that's why we've selected this bike.

31:41.852 --> 31:45.988
It's a 250cc, late-model,
single-cylinder motorcycle

31:45.990 --> 31:48.591
that meets all of those qualifications.

31:48.593 --> 31:52.495
And once again, the PEMS
will sniff out all its emissions

31:52.497 --> 31:54.130
for this base-line test.

31:54.132 --> 31:55.699
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

31:55.701 --> 31:58.869
All right, remember,
7 big laps, 25 small ones.

31:58.871 --> 32:00.303
I'll be counting them down.

32:00.305 --> 32:03.807
Here we go... late-model,
low-displacement bike test

32:03.809 --> 32:07.577
in 3, 2, 1, go!

32:10.148 --> 32:12.114
- Oops.
- One more time.

32:12.116 --> 32:14.951
In 3, 2, 1, go!

32:18.555 --> 32:19.755
And now we wait.

32:21.691 --> 32:24.426
First off, Jamie goes 'round in circles

32:24.428 --> 32:28.764
at 50 miles per hour
for 15 miles of freeway driving.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.504
Now it's time for some city driving.

32:34.506 --> 32:38.041
Then he's in the loop
for the city conditions,

32:38.043 --> 32:41.378
complete with a stop sign and
a 25-mile-per-hour speed limit.

32:42.881 --> 32:45.149
Finally, after looping both loops

32:45.151 --> 32:47.384
for 30 minutes in the saddle...

32:47.386 --> 32:49.720
Now... it's a finish line.

32:49.722 --> 32:52.523
...it's time to get
a readout on the control data.

32:55.127 --> 32:57.093
The results are in.

32:57.095 --> 32:59.162
We have our base line
for our modern bike.

32:59.164 --> 33:00.463
The good news is that

33:00.465 --> 33:03.065
it's the most fuel-efficient
bike we've tested by far,

33:03.067 --> 33:05.600
and it gave the cars
the best run for their money

33:05.602 --> 33:07.035
we've yet achieved.

33:07.037 --> 33:08.369
The bad news...

33:08.371 --> 33:11.305
its dangerous emissions
are still surprisingly high.

33:11.307 --> 33:14.275
Will our aerodynamic fairing
increase the fuel efficiency,

33:14.277 --> 33:16.210
and will the increase
in that fuel efficiency

33:16.212 --> 33:18.145
dilute the dangerous gases?

33:18.147 --> 33:19.380
I don't know.

33:19.382 --> 33:21.549
But it's time to bring out the bubble.

33:21.551 --> 33:25.119
Oh. The prototype approaches.

33:29.259 --> 33:31.225
- Are you ready for this?
- I am... all set.

33:31.227 --> 33:34.294
All right, on the green flag.

33:34.296 --> 33:39.565
Bubble bike in 3, 2, 1, go!

33:40.768 --> 33:41.801
Uh...

33:41.803 --> 33:44.370
Restart!

33:44.372 --> 33:48.207
Bubble bike test in 3, 2, 1, go!

33:53.113 --> 33:56.082
That's the second time he popped
the clutch on the starting line.

33:56.084 --> 33:59.019
After an identical start,

33:59.021 --> 34:00.620
it's an identical course,

34:00.622 --> 34:02.589
starting with a pedal-to-the-metal blast

34:02.591 --> 34:03.991
of freeway driving.

34:06.762 --> 34:08.929
Lap one is away.

34:11.065 --> 34:13.065
You know those old films of, like,

34:13.068 --> 34:15.333
people trying to take off
of cliffs in flying machines

34:15.335 --> 34:16.802
and they crash when they land?

34:16.804 --> 34:19.103
It's exactly what that thing looks like.

34:19.106 --> 34:21.139
Yeah!

34:21.141 --> 34:23.408
I'm getting to like this.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.476
Then it's science fiction in motion

34:25.478 --> 34:28.978
as Jamie puts the bubble
through its city-driving paces.

34:28.981 --> 34:31.114
It's getting kind of hot in here.

34:31.117 --> 34:34.083
All right, Jamie, this is
your last lap... last lap.

34:34.085 --> 34:38.355
And with that, Jamie's
bubbly ride comes to an end.

34:45.965 --> 34:47.898
Nice work, man! You are done.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.367
How'd that feel?

34:49.369 --> 34:52.101
This thing is crazy,
but I kind of like it.

34:52.103 --> 34:53.469
I'll tell you, it looks like

34:53.472 --> 34:55.139
a weird, kind of primordial airplane

34:55.141 --> 34:56.940
every time it takes off down the lane.

34:56.942 --> 34:58.375
It's gorgeous.

34:58.377 --> 35:01.344
Finally, it's down to the emissions data

35:01.346 --> 35:05.881
to either confirm or burst this eco-bubble.

35:05.883 --> 35:07.516
I wish we had a second bike.

35:07.518 --> 35:09.685
Then we could ride the two
of them off into the sunset,

35:09.687 --> 35:10.686
you know?

35:10.688 --> 35:12.154
Sure, why not?

35:13.824 --> 35:15.592
Like the sign says, it's crunch time.

35:15.594 --> 35:16.760
Let's have a look at the numbers.

35:16.762 --> 35:18.562
All right, let's take a look and see

35:18.564 --> 35:20.864
how we did in the fuel-economy category.

35:20.866 --> 35:22.999
Well, the fairing bike did pretty well.

35:23.001 --> 35:25.168
It got 70.9 miles per gallon.

35:25.170 --> 35:26.703
It's the best across the board.

35:26.705 --> 35:27.871
Now, I would expect,

35:27.873 --> 35:29.606
because of the increase
in fuel efficiency,

35:29.608 --> 35:32.342
to see a corresponding drop
in carbon dioxide emissions.

35:32.344 --> 35:35.579
Let's call up the carbon dioxide
chart and see how we did.

35:35.581 --> 35:38.015
And there you go... 105 grams.

35:38.017 --> 35:40.417
That's a fraction
of everything else on the chart.

35:40.419 --> 35:41.951
That is fantastic.

35:41.953 --> 35:44.620
Now I'd like to see how we did
in all of the other emissions.

35:44.622 --> 35:45.922
Let's call up the last chart.

35:45.924 --> 35:48.191
- Oh.
- Not so good.

35:48.193 --> 35:50.727
It is solidly in the middle,

35:50.729 --> 35:52.528
and the cars are still winning,
hands down.

35:52.530 --> 35:54.731
- Yep.
- Where does that leave us?

35:54.733 --> 35:55.932
Well, you know, it's tricky,

35:55.934 --> 35:57.867
because if you look at CO2 alone,

35:57.869 --> 36:00.203
the bikes win by a large margin.

36:00.205 --> 36:01.804
But if you look
at all the <i>other</i> pollutants,

36:01.806 --> 36:04.006
then the cars are far better
for the environment.

36:04.008 --> 36:06.275
I think it's got to be busted,
and here's why.

36:06.277 --> 36:07.877
Over time,

36:07.879 --> 36:10.747
cars have made a remarkable
improvement very steadily.

36:10.749 --> 36:13.150
And the bikes, well,
the bikes have gotten better

36:13.152 --> 36:15.419
but not near as much.

36:15.421 --> 36:16.486
Yep, I agree.

36:16.488 --> 36:17.788
At this point in time,

36:17.790 --> 36:19.589
it is not better for the environment

36:19.591 --> 36:21.324
to trade your car for a bike.

36:25.964 --> 36:27.198
Next up...

36:27.200 --> 36:29.033
I think everybody's dying.

36:29.035 --> 36:32.269
...the finale of bullet versus RPG

36:32.271 --> 36:34.005
goes out with a bang.

36:38.673 --> 36:40.507
In the deserts of New Mexico,

36:40.509 --> 36:44.044
it's time to test
the survivability of this.

36:49.350 --> 36:51.618
But before they bring in the dummies,

36:51.620 --> 36:53.086
there's just one problem.

36:53.088 --> 36:54.721
Oh, I lost my head.

36:54.723 --> 36:56.289
Okay, John, so based on our data,

36:56.291 --> 37:00.594
if an RPG shooter and
a gun shooter are 80 feet apart,

37:00.596 --> 37:03.364
the RPG and the bullet
will meet at 16 feet

37:03.366 --> 37:05.165
in front of the RPG shooter.

37:05.167 --> 37:06.567
What do you think about this?

37:06.569 --> 37:07.868
The biggest problem with that

37:07.870 --> 37:09.636
is that the RPG won't be armed at 16 feet.

37:09.638 --> 37:11.404
It takes a lot farther to get out.

37:11.406 --> 37:13.907
The RPG's just gonna keep right on
going like a really big bullet.

37:13.909 --> 37:16.709
Yep, and that's all down

37:16.711 --> 37:20.280
to the two stages
of the RPG's firing system.

37:20.282 --> 37:22.015
The first stage of ignition

37:22.017 --> 37:24.250
throws the grenade out of the launcher

37:24.252 --> 37:27.154
at around 384 feet per second.

37:27.156 --> 37:30.024
This sudden acceleration
triggers stage two,

37:30.026 --> 37:33.828
activating the rocket propulsion
and arming the warhead.

37:33.830 --> 37:35.497
So, unlike the movie,

37:35.499 --> 37:39.402
the rocket must be at least
60 feet from its target to arm.

37:39.404 --> 37:41.737
So, it looks like the myth
is pretty much busted outright,

37:41.739 --> 37:43.271
but what if it were a fluke?

37:43.273 --> 37:45.841
How could we still
look at this explosion?

37:45.843 --> 37:47.876
We can do this by actually
moving the target

37:47.878 --> 37:49.277
farther away from the RPG launcher

37:49.279 --> 37:52.114
to a range where it will actually be armed

37:52.116 --> 37:55.117
and positioning our dummies
in the appropriate positions

37:55.119 --> 37:56.584
for the two individuals.

37:56.586 --> 37:58.853
All right. Can I fire the RPG?

37:58.855 --> 38:01.489
- Mm, we'll see.
- Yes!

38:01.491 --> 38:03.190
Right, all is not lost.

38:03.192 --> 38:06.160
For the final parameter of survivability,

38:06.162 --> 38:09.831
they'll tweak the setup
to simulate a faulty RPG.

38:09.833 --> 38:12.268
This time, the RPG will fire

38:12.270 --> 38:16.239
from 60 feet
behind the stand-in rocketeer.

38:16.241 --> 38:18.375
I think we might have to increase
our budget on mannequins.

38:18.377 --> 38:20.311
This is a pretty ugly woman.

38:20.313 --> 38:22.213
Come here often?

38:22.215 --> 38:23.781
And just like the movie,

38:23.783 --> 38:25.983
16 feet in front of her

38:25.985 --> 38:29.152
is where the now armed warhead
will trigger.

38:29.154 --> 38:30.554
But instead of a bullet...

38:30.556 --> 38:32.923
Now, this piece of acrylic
is representing our bullet.

38:32.925 --> 38:35.091
Now, we know once the RPG is armed,

38:35.093 --> 38:37.460
it doesn't take much to set it off.

38:37.462 --> 38:39.862
And, finally, 64 feet from that

38:39.864 --> 38:43.566
is where a gun-toting dummy
will be positioned.

38:43.568 --> 38:44.801
Oh, wait a minute.

38:44.803 --> 38:46.403
You're John malkovich.
You don't get any hair.

38:46.405 --> 38:48.772
And for the lethality of the blast,

38:48.774 --> 38:50.974
well, each dummy will have two gauges.

38:50.976 --> 38:53.442
All right, what I have here is
a large piece of pork belly.

38:53.444 --> 38:57.413
This is gonna act like our human flesh.

38:57.415 --> 38:59.582
Looks good. I like that. It's a nice hat.

38:59.584 --> 39:02.485
Firstly, the gory low-tech version.

39:02.487 --> 39:04.888
Oh, God, it smells so bad!

39:04.890 --> 39:07.456
It's got muscle,
it's got flesh, it's got fat.

39:07.458 --> 39:10.226
If the shrapnel goes through
this and through the mannequin,

39:10.228 --> 39:11.694
we know that's a kill.

39:11.696 --> 39:15.364
And second, the
excitingly named high-tech version.

39:15.366 --> 39:17.200
To measure the blast wave
of the explosion,

39:17.202 --> 39:19.235
we're using this... it's a "bikini gauge".

39:19.237 --> 39:20.603
When you said bikini gauge,

39:20.605 --> 39:22.605
I had something
totally different in mind.

39:22.607 --> 39:25.608
Now, the way it works is that
we have foil spread over holes

39:25.610 --> 39:28.177
that represent different
tolerances for the overpressure.

39:28.179 --> 39:31.114
When the foil bursts,
that will indicate our number.

39:31.116 --> 39:34.484
Now, if this right here bursts,
that's 20 to 25 psi.

39:34.486 --> 39:35.918
That means that our shooters died

39:35.920 --> 39:37.253
from just the pressure wave.

39:37.255 --> 39:40.023
Well, there's only one way to find out.

39:40.025 --> 39:44.494
They're bunkering down
for the RPG survivability.

39:46.031 --> 39:48.565
Okay, this is survivability test,

39:48.567 --> 39:51.635
RPG shooter versus bullet shooter.

39:51.637 --> 39:56.140
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

40:00.413 --> 40:01.813
Mackerel!

40:02.514 --> 40:04.415
Whoa!

40:05.818 --> 40:06.952
That was intense.

40:06.954 --> 40:09.187
Intense is right.

40:09.189 --> 40:12.657
Unsurprisingly, the RPG detonates

40:12.659 --> 40:17.728
and throws forward a shower
of molten copper and debris.

40:17.730 --> 40:20.098
But did the dummies survive it?

40:21.733 --> 40:23.901
I don't believe this. She's still alive.

40:23.903 --> 40:26.070
In the movie, she was totally decimated.

40:26.072 --> 40:28.173
Yeah, and that goes along

40:28.175 --> 40:30.042
with what we've been seeing
with these RPGs.

40:30.044 --> 40:31.411
I mean, they're not like
regular grenades.

40:31.413 --> 40:33.613
It's very directional. But look at that.

40:33.615 --> 40:35.482
Our bikini gauges are still intact,

40:35.484 --> 40:37.985
which means she would've
survived that blast wave.

40:37.987 --> 40:41.889
Unlike the movie,
the villain made it through,

40:41.891 --> 40:45.159
but, more surprisingly,
so did the good guy.

40:45.161 --> 40:46.960
Oh, my God, that is incredible.

40:46.962 --> 40:49.263
He did not get touched.

40:49.265 --> 40:50.764
I mean, he didn't get hit
by one single bit.

40:52.634 --> 40:55.069
And look, our bikini
gauge didn't get ruptured.

40:55.071 --> 40:57.537
Yeah, he may have survived
but just by luck.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.474
There was a stream of molten
copper coming straight at him.

41:00.476 --> 41:03.076
If he were one foot over,
he'd be totally Swiss cheese.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.349
Especially since, in the movie,

41:08.351 --> 41:11.686
the warhead would not have been
armed on contact with the bullet

41:11.688 --> 41:15.658
but on contact
with the gun-toting good guy.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.060
Yeah, this is the exact opposite
of what it was in the movie.

41:18.062 --> 41:19.863
He would likely have been killed,

41:19.865 --> 41:21.231
and she would likely have survived.

41:21.233 --> 41:23.467
- It's busted.
- Totally busted.

41:23.469 --> 41:26.069
Hollywood not being
scientifically accurate again.

41:26.071 --> 41:27.404
Huh.

41:27.406 --> 41:30.406
Look, I'll admit it...
I was fooled by Hollywood,

41:30.408 --> 41:31.775
but here's why.

41:31.777 --> 41:34.510
Normally, when we see
an RPG hit something,

41:34.512 --> 41:37.380
there's a big flash,
and then that thing explodes.

41:37.382 --> 41:40.383
But in this case,
the RPG exploded in midair.

41:40.385 --> 41:43.420
There was nothing to create any shrapnel.

41:43.422 --> 41:45.923
And the bullet
didn't have very much mass,

41:45.925 --> 41:48.792
so there's nothing to stop
that energy in its tracks.

41:48.794 --> 41:51.328
As a result, all the energy went forward

41:51.330 --> 41:53.263
exactly as it was designed to.

41:57.068 --> 41:58.835
Well, that didn't suck.

41:58.837 --> 42:01.205
No, it didn't.

42:01.207 --> 42:03.108
Another day of work for the MythBusters.
