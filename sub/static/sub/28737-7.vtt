16:37.659 --> 16:39.214
she quit the grog.

16:40.931 --> 16:42.804
I thought she'd changed.

16:44.852 --> 16:47.516
So you were hoping to
reconnect with her, then?

16:47.977 --> 16:49.935
In some meaningful way.

16:50.411 --> 16:51.652

his claim is total horseshit.

I had a sexual relationship
with Sean five years ago.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.649
When we were working together at
Walford. It was totally consensual.

little I ever knew about you.

come up with any evidence.

startling development

in the case of disgraced Regional
Manager Corrections Derek Channing.

Media outlets have received
compromising photographs of Mr Channing,

along with documents detailing
his ownership of illegal brothels.

- It's important.

29:02.104 --> 29:03.481
I'll tell her.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.240

29:21.344 --> 29:22.742
What are you doing here?

29:23.396 --> 29:24.810

29:25.304 --> 29:26.641
Through here.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.970
- Mate, you've really fucked me up.
- Yeah,

29:40.231 --> 29:41.907
before you fucked me.

29:42.904 --> 29:45.811
I shouldn't have
threatened you. I'm sorry.

29:46.026 --> 29:49.067

- No way.

- Mate, this will fuck my career.
- Yeah, with any luck.

29:51.906 --> 29:53.379

my relationship with Vera.

you in such high esteem, Jake.

been some complications.

gonna try again for another one.

the brain so we're gonna try

35:39.456 --> 35:41.382
to lower the blood pressure and
reduce the internal bleeding,

go. I'll let you know

- How're ya feeling?
- I was looking for you.

47:10.904 --> 47:13.475
I've been here the whole
time, my little Kangaruby.

47:13.824 --> 47:15.824
Just outside the door.

47:18.698 --> 47:20.779
You're not allowed to do that again.

47:23.064 --> 47:24.784
I'm sorry.

47:30.686 --> 47:32.864
Oh, I'm sorry.

(GENTLE MUSIC)

47:41.864 --> 47:43.670
Oh.

47:44.744 --> 47:47.944
I can't stand it with her in here.

47:49.744 --> 47:52.224
It's all coming back to me, eh.

47:53.024 --> 47:55.390
Um, being a kid, living with her.

47:57.229 --> 48:01.214
I... it was hell. Like...

48:02.304 --> 48:04.172
I know, love.

48:04.584 --> 48:06.640
But that's the past.

48:06.660 --> 48:08.152
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:08.904 --> 48:11.947
And whatever bad blood's between you,

48:12.333 --> 48:14.395
she's still your mum.

48:14.784 --> 48:17.365
And the grog's a terrible
friggin' thing. I mean,

48:17.385 --> 48:19.420
it poisons everything.

48:23.235 --> 48:25.335
Well, I used to make excuses for her,

48:25.375 --> 48:27.737
- you know, thinking it was the grog. But, um,
- Yeah.

48:28.150 --> 48:29.923
now she's sober.

48:31.389 --> 48:32.946
And, uh,

48:34.346 --> 48:38.050
I'm starting to think maybe
she just hates... hates me.

48:38.076 --> 48:40.687
Oh, love. No, no, no, no, no.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.258
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:43.264 --> 48:44.888
Hey.

48:45.624 --> 48:47.591
It's gonna take time.

48:48.864 --> 48:50.864
It's gonna take time.

48:54.664 --> 48:56.504
God.

49:16.984 --> 49:19.812
- Get some sleep.
- Yep.

49:37.665 --> 49:40.455
I've got some more news on Ruby.

49:40.481 --> 49:42.727
The doctor's found something unusual.

49:42.733 --> 49:44.968
Have you ever known
Ruby to use Rohypnol?

49:45.544 --> 49:47.842
The hospital found
traces of it in her blood.

49:49.523 --> 49:51.975
You drugged Ruby to
get at her in Medical,

49:51.989 --> 49:53.785
you killed Kaz too.

49:55.204 --> 49:57.052
You're not gonna get away with it.
