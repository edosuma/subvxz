00:00.835 --> 00:01.867
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:01.902 --> 00:04.003
If the Warehouse
is to survive,

00:04.038 --> 00:08.541
a new caretaker must be in place
before I die.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.109
Me.

00:10.144 --> 00:13.997
You came into my house
and stole from me...

00:14.031 --> 00:17.906
Dismantled my life's work,
and I will respond in kind.

00:17.941 --> 00:20.243
The brotherhood follow no rules.

00:20.278 --> 00:22.044
I figured it out last week.

00:22.079 --> 00:23.551
Whenever I get hurt...

00:23.586 --> 00:25.628
Oh, ow, oh, they got me.

00:25.662 --> 00:28.433
Claudia feels the pain.

00:35.951 --> 00:39.557
in Shinto belief,
Emperor Jimmu descended

00:39.592 --> 00:41.294
from the sun goddess.

00:41.329 --> 00:43.597
He reigned for 75 years,

00:43.632 --> 00:46.969
often accompanied
by a wild crow.

00:47.003 --> 00:50.644
From that crow,
there exists a feather.

00:50.678 --> 00:52.428
Behold.

01:03.994 --> 01:06.631
Beautiful, but deadly.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.444
And money?

01:16.379 --> 01:18.380
Also beautiful.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.445
Now we drink to honor Jimmu.

01:40.656 --> 01:42.624
Stop her!

01:46.895 --> 01:48.061
Oh!

01:49.597 --> 01:52.154
Claude, don't look,
you'll go insane!

01:54.669 --> 01:57.104
Whew!

01:58.505 --> 02:00.039
- Wait.
- Huh?

02:00.073 --> 02:01.807
Something's vibrating.

02:03.776 --> 02:07.145
I think it's me.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.580
Ugh, it's my sister, Tracy.

02:09.616 --> 02:10.916
Hey, trace, listen,
I'm just at work.

02:10.949 --> 02:13.118
I'll call you back...

02:13.152 --> 02:15.287
What?

02:15.322 --> 02:17.023
Oh, my God, that's great news.

02:17.058 --> 02:19.025
- Congratulations.
- What, what, what, what?!

02:19.060 --> 02:20.026
My sister's pregnant.

02:20.061 --> 02:21.294
I-I'm gonna be an aunt.

02:21.329 --> 02:24.186
I'm gonna get to hold
a new life in my arms.

02:27.704 --> 02:30.406
Trace? Listen, what do you think
about a japanese theme

02:30.440 --> 02:31.819
for the nursery?

02:42.187 --> 02:44.922
Left in the second period...

02:49.061 --> 02:51.163
Oh, Artemis, hockey, huh?

02:51.197 --> 02:53.566
- Who you rooting for?
- Nobody.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.101
Right, let me see
if I can explain

02:55.135 --> 02:57.136
this whole sports fan
thing to you.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.372
- Let's say there was a...
- Hello, kitties!

02:59.406 --> 03:00.406
We're back from Japan.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.574
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

03:01.609 --> 03:02.776
Put that thing under
a neutralizer light.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.912
Whatever you say, Rilakkuma.

03:04.946 --> 03:05.979
What's a Rikaluma?

03:06.014 --> 03:07.481
It's a japanese bear

03:07.515 --> 03:09.316
who loves custard pudding.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.985
Oh, Artie,
you got a new nickname.

03:11.019 --> 03:12.453
How would you like a new job?

03:12.488 --> 03:13.454
Hmm...

03:13.489 --> 03:15.190
I got it for my sister, Tracy.

03:15.224 --> 03:16.258
She's pregnant.

03:16.292 --> 03:18.494
- Wow.
- Yeah, I'm so excited.

03:18.528 --> 03:19.995
Really?

03:20.030 --> 03:21.497
Yeah.

03:21.531 --> 03:23.833
N-no, yeah, no,
that's... it's just that

03:23.867 --> 03:26.336
you know, she's, you know,
the younger sister,

03:26.370 --> 03:28.104
and you're the older sister.

03:28.139 --> 03:30.941
Are you living in 1957?

03:30.975 --> 03:34.211
Getting pregnant's not on my
current to-do list, all right?

03:34.246 --> 03:35.279
How about finding an artifact.

03:35.314 --> 03:36.681
Is that on your current
to-do list?

03:36.715 --> 03:38.984
We got a ping from last night's
game in Toronto.

03:39.018 --> 03:42.454
Let's go to the videotape.

03:42.488 --> 03:45.625
Toronto's Mike madden
has the puck.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.859
Baird is charging.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.861
Oh! Baird nails him
in the right arm.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.364
- So baird has the artifact.
- Watch.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.233
That looks like
a career-ending break.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.300
What a shame.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.136
This vet's been on fire lately,

03:56.170 --> 03:57.871
but you break your arm,
and it's over.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.872
There, do you see that?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.108
- I do.
- See what?

04:01.142 --> 04:03.811
What, she's the observant one,

04:03.845 --> 04:07.315
and I'm the one
who eats all the time.

04:07.350 --> 04:09.117
Hey, w-wait, he's up.
Madden is up!

04:09.152 --> 04:11.620
So madden has some kind of
healing artifact.

04:11.654 --> 04:13.489
Oh, he's healed, all right,
and he's stronger than ever.

04:13.523 --> 04:17.159
Fast forwarding.

04:17.192 --> 04:18.961
Baird with the puck.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.495
Madden approaches him...

04:20.531 --> 04:21.529
Wow!

04:21.565 --> 04:23.299
- Whoa.
- That's not hockey.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.466
That's pole vaulting.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.567
How the hell did he do that?

04:25.602 --> 04:27.536
That's what I
want you to find out.

04:27.571 --> 04:30.406
Stop that hockey player
before he kills someone.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.042
We're on it.

04:33.076 --> 04:35.878
And I'm gonna stay here
and keep you company.

04:35.912 --> 04:38.914
At least he does
what he's told.

04:42.118 --> 04:45.420
Oh... he's so soft and fuzzy.

04:45.454 --> 04:47.622
The bear too.

04:47.656 --> 04:48.990
Oh!

04:49.024 --> 04:53.361
Oh, um, this arrived for you.

04:53.395 --> 04:55.095
What?

04:55.130 --> 04:57.231
Who would write me
at the Warehouse?

04:57.265 --> 05:01.835
I encourage you to open
the envelope and find out.

05:01.869 --> 05:06.239
I've been cordially
invited to lunch.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.240
Eek.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.075
By Mrs. Frederic.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.410
Why? Why?

05:10.444 --> 05:12.679
Why don't you ask her?
Over lunch.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.714
Do you think this
has something to do with

05:14.748 --> 05:16.816
the weird feelings
I've been having lately?

05:16.850 --> 05:20.421
What weird feelings?

05:20.455 --> 05:21.823
I don't know, like, uh...

05:21.857 --> 05:23.826
Out of nowhere I get these
weird kicks in the gut,

05:23.860 --> 05:25.728
my heart races,
I can't catch my breath.

05:25.763 --> 05:28.464
It's like I'm not
in control of myself.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.476
Why didn't you tell me
about this sooner?

05:37.510 --> 05:38.644
I don't know,
I didn't wanna worry you?

05:38.678 --> 05:39.645
Look, forget I said anything.

05:39.679 --> 05:43.385
I clearly have bigger problems.

05:51.592 --> 05:54.361
Hey, are you guys going in
to watch practice?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.130
- Could you take this in for me?
- And this?

05:56.164 --> 05:58.065
- You know, for Mike madden?
- Are those molasses crinkles?

05:58.099 --> 05:59.400
Okay, keep moving.

05:59.434 --> 06:02.403
Okay, remember, for Mike.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.709
Oh, I love molasses crinkles.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.145
One thing I've learned
in 20 years of running a team...

06:11.180 --> 06:12.847
Never eat fan food.

06:12.881 --> 06:14.982
It could be laced
with who knows what.

06:15.017 --> 06:17.351
Could make your parts fall off.

06:17.386 --> 06:19.353
Coach!

06:22.658 --> 06:24.158
All right, listen up.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.793
The league sent
these nice folks out.

06:25.827 --> 06:26.960
They have some questions.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.730
You will answer them.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.666
I'd like to start
with Mike madden.

06:32.701 --> 06:34.068
Of course you would.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.403
Anything to meet the most
eligible bachelor in Toronto.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.273
Pffft!

06:41.176 --> 06:42.777
Hi, I'm agent Bering.

06:42.811 --> 06:45.780
Well, it's nice to meet you
agent Bering.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.620
So, I just wanted to ask you...

06:52.654 --> 06:55.356
Why I was voted the most
eligible bachelor in Toronto?

06:55.391 --> 06:58.092
I'm sure I'll read all about
that in your memoir.

06:58.127 --> 07:00.661
Um, you've been
playing rough lately.

07:00.696 --> 07:02.230
Right, and the league
has a problem with that?

07:02.264 --> 07:03.364
It's hockey.

07:03.398 --> 07:04.666
Well, you put a guy
through the glass.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.000
- How'd you do that?
- Well, there must have been

07:06.035 --> 07:07.235
a crack in it already.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.603
But you'd just been injured
very badly.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.939
Yes, but during a game,
your adrenaline surges,

07:10.973 --> 07:12.807
so you just keep going.

07:12.842 --> 07:14.843
Well how about now,
are you in pain now?

07:14.877 --> 07:17.913
Look, every player
on the ice is in pain.

07:17.947 --> 07:19.548
We live with it 24/7,

07:19.582 --> 07:21.650
but if you think
I'm on something,

07:21.684 --> 07:24.986
feel free to draw some blood,
or I could pee in a cup for you.

07:25.021 --> 07:26.788
You got a cup?

07:28.357 --> 07:30.993
May I see that necklace
you're wearing?

07:32.095 --> 07:34.863
The league
is cracking down on gold.

07:34.897 --> 07:36.498
So I would like to test it.

07:36.532 --> 07:38.800
Unless, of course, you have
a problem removing it.

07:47.744 --> 07:50.145
- Uh... you finished?
- Yeah.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.648
Gooery didn't need
to be flushed after all.

07:52.682 --> 07:53.882
Where you headed?

07:53.917 --> 07:55.918
Uh, inventory.

08:00.423 --> 08:03.291
Hang back, tray,
I'm gonna need you.

08:03.326 --> 08:05.127
Artie's lying.

08:06.128 --> 08:07.629
Hey, the team is winning

08:07.663 --> 08:08.997
'cause we're all
working our butts off.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.466
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe some
people have a little help,

08:11.500 --> 08:12.934
you know? Insurance.

08:12.968 --> 08:14.035
We're all clean here.

08:14.069 --> 08:15.036
Right, boss?

08:15.070 --> 08:16.037
That's right, beast.

08:16.071 --> 08:17.171
None of my boys take

08:17.205 --> 08:19.006
any performance-enhancing
substances.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.707
Now here's the x-ray
you asked for.

08:20.742 --> 08:23.877
Mike's arm,
taken right after the game.

08:23.911 --> 08:26.012
No reaction.
Good.

08:26.046 --> 08:27.513
Well, here you go.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.749
And it's shinier than before.

08:29.783 --> 08:31.317
And stickier too.

08:31.351 --> 08:32.852
- Are we done?
- One more question.

08:32.885 --> 08:34.453
- Do you like antiquing?
- What?

08:34.488 --> 08:36.989
You know, going to flea
markets, buying old stuff?

08:37.023 --> 08:39.258
Are you asking me on a date?

08:39.292 --> 08:42.027
Just answer the question
like the team owner said.

08:42.062 --> 08:44.063
No, because
it's a stupid question.

08:44.097 --> 08:46.566
- Good-bye.
- There are no stupid questions,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.501
okay? Only stupid people.

08:48.535 --> 08:51.070
So if anyone's
stupid here, it's you!

08:51.105 --> 08:53.807
He's hostile and unresponsive.

08:53.841 --> 08:55.609
I wonder why.

08:55.643 --> 08:59.647
Oh, here I got the x-ray
of madden's stupid arm!

09:03.118 --> 09:05.319
So wh... what,
you can read those things?

09:05.353 --> 09:07.354
Yeah, I was pre-med
before I was pre-law

09:07.389 --> 09:08.656
before I joined
the secret service.

09:08.690 --> 09:12.593
And yet, you ended up
in the exact same place as me.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.128
I'm just saying.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.730
Something's wrong.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.600
The hand in this x-ray
shows a bilateral fusion

09:18.634 --> 09:20.135
between the trapezium
and the trapezoid.

09:20.169 --> 09:21.803
It's a congenital condition.

09:21.837 --> 09:24.105
So? And may I add, huh?

09:24.139 --> 09:26.541
So when I shook Mike's hand...

09:27.910 --> 09:31.679
I felt those bones,
and there was no fusion.

09:31.714 --> 09:33.348
The x-Ray's a fake?

09:33.382 --> 09:35.349
This isn't
stupid madden's stupid arm.

09:35.383 --> 09:37.351
We need to break into
the medical office

09:37.385 --> 09:38.786
and find the real x-ray.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.588
All right,
we need a distraction.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.156
I'm gonna jump on the Zamboni,

09:42.190 --> 09:44.058
and I'm gonna zoom around
the ice while you...

09:44.092 --> 09:47.695
Pete, no one's... no one's
looking at us... so...

09:47.729 --> 09:49.697
I know, but I wanted
to ride the Zamboni.

09:49.731 --> 09:51.098
I know you did.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.234
It's okay.
Let's go.

09:55.837 --> 09:58.406
No.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.343
No.

10:04.413 --> 10:05.847
Trailer.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.485
He's with me.

10:10.519 --> 10:11.986
You shouldn't
have followed me.

10:12.021 --> 10:13.655
Artie, you're lying.

10:13.689 --> 10:15.957
You know I can tell.

10:15.992 --> 10:18.393
Now, what's going on?

10:18.428 --> 10:20.028
Artifacts are disappearing
from the Warehouse.

10:20.062 --> 10:22.731
First it was Bobby Fischer's
marble and now...

10:22.765 --> 10:24.733
Primo Levy's scarf and who knows
what else has been taken.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.801
I thought the Warehouse
had a detection system

10:26.836 --> 10:28.303
that alerts you when
artifacts go missing.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.805
It should... it does,
but it didn't alert my computer.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.040
Okay, so let's just call
Claudia and...

10:32.074 --> 10:33.875
Nope, no.

10:33.910 --> 10:38.680
No, we'll... just keep all this
between us for now.

10:38.714 --> 10:40.682
- Understood?
- Okay.

10:40.716 --> 10:44.285
Well, this can't
have been random.

10:44.319 --> 10:47.988
I went myself to turin in 1987
to snag the scarf.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.190
- So it meant something to you.
- Yeah.

10:50.225 --> 10:52.759
What other items
would get under your skin.

10:52.794 --> 10:55.095
The katana.

10:55.129 --> 10:57.530
The katana.

10:57.565 --> 10:59.565
Aisle kamakura east!

10:59.600 --> 11:01.501
Come on!

11:01.535 --> 11:02.835
Come on, tray.

11:02.869 --> 11:05.437
Did you find
madden's real arm?

11:05.472 --> 11:08.541
Yeah. There's no fusing
in the metacarpals.

11:08.575 --> 11:10.409
And, I mean,
the bone is clearly broken,

11:10.444 --> 11:13.178
but this... this I have
never seen before.

11:13.213 --> 11:14.746
The muscle and cartilage
have actually

11:14.781 --> 11:17.316
grown around
the broken bone to support it.

11:17.350 --> 11:18.550
That thing's
being held together

11:18.585 --> 11:20.719
by the artifact equivalent
of spit and glue.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.721
Yeah, but
it's not just his arm.

11:22.755 --> 11:25.290
I mean, his knee is shot
and his ribs are cracked.

11:25.325 --> 11:27.526
This guy should not be playing
professional hockey.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.529
Pete, this guy shouldn't even
be walking.

11:34.783 --> 11:36.618
Aw, man.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.620
Quick, before he
gets out of the shower.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.222
Okay.

11:40.256 --> 11:41.990
Helmet.

11:42.024 --> 11:44.826
The mouth guard.

11:44.861 --> 11:49.230
Shin guard.

11:49.264 --> 11:50.231
- Uh...
- Penis guard.

11:50.265 --> 11:54.268
Eew.

11:54.302 --> 11:55.536
No reaction.

11:55.570 --> 11:57.204
Maybe Mike has
the artifact on him.

11:57.239 --> 12:01.008
No, he's naked in the shower,
and I already checked his chain.

12:03.145 --> 12:04.912
How much you pay me not
to tell anyone you said that?

12:04.947 --> 12:05.913
- 50 bucks.
- Done.

12:05.948 --> 12:07.215
Okay.

12:07.249 --> 12:08.216
Really, that's how
it's gonna be, eh?

12:08.250 --> 12:09.217
Well, what do you want?

12:09.251 --> 12:10.384
You're holding out on me!

12:10.419 --> 12:12.486
I'll go.

12:12.521 --> 12:13.854
I'll stay here.

12:13.889 --> 12:16.491
No, I'm not,
I swear to God, I'm not.

12:16.525 --> 12:18.826
Then what's making you
so strong, huh?!

12:18.861 --> 12:21.362
Back off, Frank, or I'll do
to you what I did to baird.

12:21.396 --> 12:23.030
Hey, knock it off!

12:23.065 --> 12:24.031
Stay out of this, man.

12:24.065 --> 12:25.566
No, I'm in it, okay?

12:25.600 --> 12:28.202
And so is the league if you
don't back off right now.

12:28.236 --> 12:30.203
Fine, man.

12:30.238 --> 12:31.538
We're cool, right, Mike?

12:31.572 --> 12:34.540
Yeah, yeah, we're cool.

12:37.210 --> 12:41.179
Aw, man, these were brand new.

12:42.548 --> 12:44.949
Myka, Myka.

12:44.984 --> 12:46.985
Hey, sign says
team personnel only.

12:47.019 --> 12:48.420
Oh, well I must
have missed it.

12:48.454 --> 12:49.788
Well someone's
not very observant.

12:49.822 --> 12:51.590
Well someone's penis guard
is not very b...

12:51.624 --> 12:53.392
Ho-kay.

12:53.427 --> 12:54.594
Uh, why don't
we let Mike get dressed,

12:54.628 --> 12:56.229
and, uh, I need to talk to you.

12:56.263 --> 12:58.331
Okay? Here we go.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.968
- Come on.
- Oh, look, there it is.

13:02.002 --> 13:03.936
I see your stupid sign now.

13:03.971 --> 13:06.372
Mykes, Mykes,
he was fighting in there.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.507
And he wasn't the same guy
we saw on the ice.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.009
He was in pain.

13:10.043 --> 13:11.678
I don't think
he's using an artifact.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.446
I think someone's
using one on him.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.049
What about Larry Kemp,
the owner?

13:16.083 --> 13:17.751
That would explain why
he gave us the wrong x-ray.

13:17.785 --> 13:19.752
Well... okay.

13:19.787 --> 13:22.756
Let's just hope
he's not in the shower too.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.662
Thank you, ma'am.
Be right back.

13:28.696 --> 13:31.164
Miss Donovan,
thank you for joining me.

13:31.199 --> 13:32.232
Sure.

13:32.266 --> 13:33.300
Am I late?

13:33.334 --> 13:34.367
Did I miss lunch?

13:34.402 --> 13:36.369
No time.

13:36.404 --> 13:37.804
Let's take a walk.

13:37.839 --> 13:39.206
That's what the mafia says

13:39.240 --> 13:40.407
when you're about
to get whacked.

13:40.441 --> 13:41.942
Do they?

13:41.976 --> 13:44.444
Well, this concerns your
relationship with the Warehouse.

13:44.479 --> 13:48.749
Oh, my, uh, my destiny?

13:48.783 --> 13:51.284
And mine.

13:51.319 --> 13:53.419
Has something changed?

13:53.454 --> 13:56.322
Not yet.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.024
I just think it's time
you had a glimpse.

13:58.058 --> 14:01.127
Don't worry,
you won't be whacked.

14:01.161 --> 14:03.696
- Come.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:03.731 --> 14:05.265
All right, Kemp, spit it out.

14:05.299 --> 14:06.466
What did you do to Mike madden?

14:06.500 --> 14:07.834
Well, hello to you, too.

14:07.868 --> 14:10.136
Canadian customs
confiscate your manners?

14:10.171 --> 14:11.538
How's he sustaining

14:11.572 --> 14:13.006
that level of play?

14:13.040 --> 14:15.775
Like all great athletes,
he's rising to the challenge.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.344
He's practically crippled,

14:17.378 --> 14:19.145
which is why you showed us
the phony x-ray.

14:19.180 --> 14:20.981
It's not like
you had a warrant.

14:21.015 --> 14:22.549
Mike put a guy
through the glass.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.784
Now what are you doing to him?

14:23.818 --> 14:26.319
What am I doing to him?

14:26.354 --> 14:29.055
Look, two of my best players
are on the injured reserve list.

14:29.089 --> 14:30.823
If I were doing
anything to help him play,

14:30.858 --> 14:33.226
I would do it to them and not an
old war horse like Mike madden.

14:33.260 --> 14:35.127
Aw, come on, I mean,
the guy's having a great year.

14:35.161 --> 14:37.329
Oh, yeah, he really brings it
for the fans at the home games,

14:37.363 --> 14:39.131
and on the road,
he's a total wash.

14:39.165 --> 14:40.265
I think we're done here.

14:43.469 --> 14:44.902
- Pete?
- Yeah?

14:44.937 --> 14:47.938
I think we need to take
a closer look at the rink.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.477
So Mike brings it
at home games.

14:53.512 --> 14:56.514
Ipso facto, the artifact
must be here in the arena.

14:56.548 --> 14:59.850
Another facto, I was watching
Mike during practice.

14:59.885 --> 15:01.485
The guy was wobbly.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.653
So what's here during games

15:02.687 --> 15:04.221
that isn't here
the rest of the time?

15:04.256 --> 15:05.823
I don't know, fans?

15:08.293 --> 15:13.898
Mykes, maybe one of the hometown
fans is "bringing it" for Mike.

15:13.932 --> 15:19.437
And that narrows it down
to about 15,000 suspects.

15:21.740 --> 15:24.074
Gone!

15:24.109 --> 15:25.542
Gone!

15:25.577 --> 15:26.877
And gone!

15:26.911 --> 15:29.880
Gone! Someone is undoing
my life's work!

15:29.914 --> 15:33.350
Can you please
stop for a second?

15:33.385 --> 15:38.522
Look, we just need to think
and get ahead of this thing.

15:38.556 --> 15:40.991
Now is there any artifact
the intruder might have taken

15:41.026 --> 15:42.393
that's easy for us to locate?

15:42.427 --> 15:44.028
An artifact
with a homing device?

15:44.062 --> 15:46.599
Yeah, that would be convenient.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.767
The McCoy rifle.

15:48.802 --> 15:50.102
I snagged the McCoy rifle.

15:50.137 --> 15:52.305
Don't just stand there!

15:52.339 --> 15:55.342
You do know
I'm on foot, right?

15:59.614 --> 16:01.648
Excellent!

16:01.682 --> 16:04.151
The McCoy rifle is gone.

16:04.185 --> 16:07.554
And... now we gotta see

16:07.588 --> 16:09.656
if the hatfield rifle
is missing too.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.058
We have to separate both rifles.

16:11.092 --> 16:12.626
Wouldn't he take both?

16:12.661 --> 16:13.694
Not if he's trying
to make a point.

16:13.728 --> 16:16.029
I did not snag
the hatfield rifle.

16:16.064 --> 16:17.130
That was another agent.

16:17.165 --> 16:18.566
If the hatfield rifle is here,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.734
it will lead us to the McCoy.

16:19.768 --> 16:21.402
- Come on!
- If you're trying to kill me,

16:21.436 --> 16:22.870
you're too late.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.343
Look around, miss Donovan.

16:28.377 --> 16:31.378
- Do you sense anything?
- Hunger?

16:31.412 --> 16:32.979
I think there's
a falafel place down the...

16:33.013 --> 16:34.313
Pay attention.

16:34.347 --> 16:37.349
Look beyond what you see.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.699
Her.

16:56.734 --> 16:57.867
Very good.

16:57.901 --> 17:01.271
Don't point.
It's rude.

17:01.305 --> 17:03.006
What is it about her?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.482
Stay focused.

17:12.816 --> 17:15.349
Be a good boy.

17:15.384 --> 17:18.519
Did you set those earrings
aside for me?

17:18.554 --> 17:19.787
This is a robbery!

17:19.820 --> 17:22.255
We're not here to intervene.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.558
Stay with me.

17:24.592 --> 17:26.792
Don't move!

17:26.827 --> 17:27.827
Don't!

17:27.861 --> 17:31.496
Everybody just
get down on the ground!

17:33.199 --> 17:34.599
No!

17:34.633 --> 17:36.467
No!

17:52.129 --> 17:53.162
Help is coming.

17:53.196 --> 17:54.330
You're gonna be okay.

17:54.364 --> 17:57.366
You saved that baby's life.

17:59.035 --> 18:02.004
I'm a doctor... if you're not
needed, please step back.

18:06.743 --> 18:08.310
Did you know
that was gonna happen?

18:08.344 --> 18:10.245
It depends what
you mean by "that"

18:10.279 --> 18:12.047
and what you mean by "happen".

18:12.081 --> 18:14.049
Well, I saw her
bracelet get all glowy,

18:14.083 --> 18:16.852
but I don't know what
the artifact did unless...

18:16.886 --> 18:19.121
Unless that was...

18:19.155 --> 18:21.189
The birth
of an artifact.

18:21.224 --> 18:23.158
Imbued by the bravery
of a moment,

18:23.192 --> 18:25.794
an ordinary woman
doing an extraordinary thing.

18:25.828 --> 18:26.828
Shouldn't we snag it?

18:26.863 --> 18:28.163
No, it's hers.

18:28.197 --> 18:30.666
It only becomes ours
if it starts causing trouble.

18:30.700 --> 18:34.102
But d... I thought most
artifacts came from...

18:34.136 --> 18:35.470
Bold-face names, you know?

18:35.505 --> 18:37.472
People with Wikipedia pages.

18:37.506 --> 18:39.741
The creation of an artifact

18:39.775 --> 18:43.745
is simply the meeting of an
object, a person and a moment.

18:45.881 --> 18:48.049
That's a good glimpse.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.984
You got a rockin' gig, Mrs. F.

18:50.018 --> 18:51.085
Mrs. Frederic.

18:52.755 --> 18:55.123
There's something else
you should see.

18:55.157 --> 18:59.094
Oh, uh, am I
going with you or...

18:59.128 --> 19:02.097
Unless you'd like
to take the bus.

19:03.132 --> 19:04.900
Okay.

19:04.934 --> 19:07.269
Look, Mike, we can't
get into specifics,

19:07.304 --> 19:08.638
but we're pretty sure
one of your fans

19:08.672 --> 19:10.339
is boosting
your ability to play.

19:10.374 --> 19:13.810
Are there any particular fans
that you interact with?

19:13.844 --> 19:16.012
No, I'm polite, but you gotta
keep your distance.

19:16.047 --> 19:17.614
We really appreciate this.

19:17.649 --> 19:21.952
We know that, um, this might
end your season, so...

19:21.986 --> 19:24.087
Well, hey, if I'm getting
some kind of outside help,

19:24.122 --> 19:25.089
I don't want it;
That's cheating

19:25.123 --> 19:27.324
and, um, I don't cheat.

19:27.358 --> 19:28.792
All right,
well, here's the plan.

19:28.826 --> 19:30.660
We're gonna gather
all your hardcore fans

19:30.695 --> 19:32.228
into one section,
then we're gonna

19:32.263 --> 19:34.097
raffle off a dinner with you
after the game.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.331
Yes, and early in the game,

19:35.366 --> 19:36.332
you'll take a fall and pretend

19:36.367 --> 19:37.333
to be hurt very badly.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.601
Like during the last game.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.169
Exactly, and then we'll,
you know,

19:40.203 --> 19:42.237
we'll study them very closely
to make sure none of them

19:42.272 --> 19:44.106
pulls out a rolling pin
or something.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.274
A what?

19:45.308 --> 19:47.710
Nothing.
Just ignore him.

19:47.744 --> 19:50.779
Hey, uh, okay,
we gotta finish setting up.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.314
No problem, I got it.

19:52.348 --> 19:53.448
Agent Bering?

19:53.482 --> 19:55.250
I still don't know
your first name.

19:55.284 --> 19:57.552
Oh, it's, uh, Myka.

19:57.586 --> 20:00.288
Wow, Mike and Myka.

20:00.323 --> 20:01.790
Like papageno
and papagena from...

20:01.824 --> 20:03.091
Mozart's <i>magic flute.</i>

20:04.327 --> 20:05.394
You know opera?

20:05.428 --> 20:07.262
Yeah, yeah,
don't tell my teammates.

20:07.296 --> 20:08.263
Well, 'cause you never know...

20:08.298 --> 20:09.965
Hey, can we get going?

20:09.999 --> 20:13.902
Uh, you can play
Mike's magic flute later.

20:13.936 --> 20:18.907
I have to go kill him now,
so I'm just gonna... go...

20:22.579 --> 20:25.515
Ugh, get me some popcorn
and a tampon,

20:25.549 --> 20:27.450
'cause I am watching
a romantic comedy.

20:27.484 --> 20:28.584
What?! Shut up!

20:28.618 --> 20:30.219
Oh, yeah, you and Mike meet,

20:30.253 --> 20:32.587
you hate each other and the next
thing you know, you're kissing.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.588
That's crazy.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.590
Oh, yeah?

20:34.624 --> 20:36.024
'Cause love is crazy, Mykes.

20:36.059 --> 20:37.259
That's right, girl.

20:37.294 --> 20:40.096
I am the sassy best friend.

20:41.598 --> 20:42.732
We caught a break.

20:42.766 --> 20:45.035
Hatfield rifle is still here.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.537
Gloves.

20:46.571 --> 20:48.272
And how's it connected
to the other rifle?

20:48.306 --> 20:50.140
Gravitational pull
between the barrels

20:50.175 --> 20:51.642
fueled by the hatred
between the clans

20:51.677 --> 20:54.746
and also... now your eyes
are younger than mine.

20:54.780 --> 20:57.014
You look through the sights,
tell me what you see.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.217
Just...
Okay.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.855
It's just a window and what
looks like a garage.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.690
Any identifying landmarks?

21:05.725 --> 21:07.492
Just a giant cow.

21:07.526 --> 21:09.060
Cow.

21:09.095 --> 21:11.629
Like a cow with lipstick?

21:11.663 --> 21:13.231
Yeah.

21:13.265 --> 21:14.532
I know that cow.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.067
It's outside a steakhouse
in featherhead.

21:16.101 --> 21:17.735
Excellent clue.
Not a bad lunch.

21:17.770 --> 21:18.769
Bring the rifle.

21:29.548 --> 21:31.549
Marry me!

21:33.753 --> 21:34.719
Okay, guys.

21:34.754 --> 21:36.721
Make sure you put your name,

21:36.756 --> 21:40.091
correct information,
and your seat number...

21:40.126 --> 21:41.226
Good job...

21:41.260 --> 21:43.227
For the big raffle's
after the game.

21:43.262 --> 21:44.962
Whoo-hoo!

21:44.997 --> 21:46.698
Oh, well, that's cute.

21:46.732 --> 21:49.300
Just, I'm sorry, one card each.

21:49.335 --> 21:52.311
She's always over the top.

21:53.806 --> 21:55.273
Oh, yeah.

22:03.014 --> 22:04.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.250
Are you all set to do this?

22:06.284 --> 22:07.451
Who knows?

22:07.485 --> 22:09.653
- Sure.
- I wish I could tell you more

22:09.687 --> 22:11.989
about what's going on,
it's just, uh...

22:12.023 --> 22:15.058
- Unexplainable.
- Yeah.

22:15.092 --> 22:17.327
Sorry.

22:17.361 --> 22:19.329
Thank you.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.068
You know,
when I first met you,

22:26.103 --> 22:27.737
I didn't wanna
let go then either.

22:27.771 --> 22:33.275
That was kinda
unexplainable too.

22:33.309 --> 22:35.777
For good luck?

22:37.714 --> 22:40.682
Look, Mike's kissing someone!

22:49.092 --> 22:51.360
You go, girl!

23:09.245 --> 23:11.213
Hey.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.051
Hey, there, buckaroo.

23:16.085 --> 23:17.451
Uh...

23:17.486 --> 23:19.821
I-I'm the purse inspector.

23:19.855 --> 23:22.023
I know.

23:22.057 --> 23:24.125
Where...
Where's your mom and dad?

23:24.159 --> 23:27.295
Jakey, what are you doing?

23:27.329 --> 23:28.529
Come on.

23:28.563 --> 23:30.731
Our seats are over here.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.516
Mike's hurt!

24:17.114 --> 24:19.782
Oh, my God,
what the hell is that?!

24:24.421 --> 24:26.256
Myka, where'd you go?

24:26.290 --> 24:28.825
Pete, I'm in the ladies room
behind section d.

24:28.860 --> 24:31.095
I need you now.

24:36.734 --> 24:38.702
- Mykes?
- Yeah...

24:38.736 --> 24:41.671
Oh, my God,
you're... you're pregnant.

24:41.706 --> 24:43.673
I know...

24:47.649 --> 24:49.783
You're really,
really pregnant.

24:49.818 --> 24:50.951
I know.

24:50.986 --> 24:51.952
How the hell did that happen?

24:51.987 --> 24:53.487
I don't know!

24:53.522 --> 24:56.824
I'm guessing she had sex.

24:56.858 --> 24:58.292
Pete?

24:58.326 --> 25:02.763
You know my... oh, Pete, my bra's
really not made for these.

25:02.797 --> 25:05.432
Okay, okay, here, put this on.

25:05.466 --> 25:06.533
Yes.

25:06.568 --> 25:08.435
Oh, my God,
I had to get out of there.

25:08.470 --> 25:12.506
The smell of ammonia... I-
I can smell everything now.

25:12.540 --> 25:15.041
All right, well, in advance
of what I'm sure I'll do,

25:15.075 --> 25:17.209
- I apologize.
- Who?

25:17.244 --> 25:20.580
Right, okay, look, Mykes,
somebody whammied you.

25:20.615 --> 25:21.848
Ya think?

25:21.883 --> 25:23.617
Okay, I know where and when,

25:23.651 --> 25:25.719
but I don't know who,
what, or how.

25:25.753 --> 25:27.154
Call Artie.

25:27.188 --> 25:30.023
If Claudia finds out
you borrowed her Prius C,

25:30.058 --> 25:31.825
she's gonna rake you
over the coals.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.360
Well, joke'll be on her then.

25:33.394 --> 25:34.628
What?

25:34.662 --> 25:36.296
Uh, nothing.

25:36.330 --> 25:39.099
Hey, have you, uh, checked out
this car's entune system?

25:39.134 --> 25:41.402
It's got, uh, bing and pandora.

25:41.436 --> 25:43.304
Oh, what a relief.
That way if we can't find

25:43.338 --> 25:44.538
the missing artifact,

25:44.573 --> 25:45.973
we can customize
our music stations.

25:46.008 --> 25:47.842
- Hey, caw.
- Yes.

25:47.876 --> 25:49.377
I think the garage
must be nearby.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.647
- Whoa!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:53.681 --> 25:55.148
The hatfield rifle's
starting to tug.

25:55.183 --> 25:57.117
That means the McCoy is nearby.

25:57.152 --> 25:58.486
Wait...

25:58.520 --> 26:00.521
- Artie!
- This better be important.

26:00.556 --> 26:01.656
Artie, I'm pregnant.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.627
Ha, ha and I'm Mary,
queen of scots.

26:05.661 --> 26:07.896
What? How did you... Pete!

26:07.931 --> 26:09.532
I didn't even touch her.

26:09.566 --> 26:11.367
Look, Artie,
I was at the hockey and game,

26:11.401 --> 26:14.437
and I felt this pain
in my abdomen,

26:14.472 --> 26:16.206
and then I don't know
what happened

26:16.240 --> 26:18.775
and I don't know why
I'm starting to cry.

26:18.809 --> 26:20.009
It's hormonal.

26:20.043 --> 26:21.377
Don't say hormonal, okay?

26:21.411 --> 26:22.612
It makes me wanna cry more.

26:22.646 --> 26:23.980
See, that's why
I never married.

26:24.014 --> 26:25.382
Preaching to the choir.

26:25.416 --> 26:26.683
Look, Artie,
this came out of nowhere.

26:26.717 --> 26:28.518
We thought we were hunting
for a healing artifact

26:28.553 --> 26:29.519
owned by a fan.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.455
A healed athlete,
pregnant woman.

26:31.489 --> 26:34.324
This could be a wish-fulfillment
artifact instead.

26:34.359 --> 26:35.592
Myka, what did you touch?

26:35.626 --> 26:38.528
What?! You... you... you think
that I wished for this?

26:38.563 --> 26:39.796
What is wrong with you guys?

26:39.831 --> 26:41.398
Okay, I am very
happy for my sister,

26:41.432 --> 26:42.666
but I don't wanna be pregnant.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.968
Yeah, well, who else
would wish this on you?

26:45.002 --> 26:46.603
Well, I don...
I don't know, Artie.

26:46.637 --> 26:51.074
Uh, Mike?
I mean, we did kiss.

26:51.108 --> 26:53.176
Artie, the rifle...
I can't hold still much longer.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.865
Well, talk to Mike,
and no more kissing!

26:57.047 --> 26:59.682
- He didn't even say good-bye.
- He never does.

26:59.716 --> 27:01.517
Okay.

27:01.551 --> 27:07.156
You know, Pete, maybe...
Maybe I don't know myself.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.558
You know, maybe... maybe I am
jealous of my sister.

27:09.592 --> 27:12.360
Maybe I did wish for this.

27:12.395 --> 27:14.496
Yeah, I don't think so.

27:14.530 --> 27:18.400
What makes you say that?

27:18.434 --> 27:20.301
Because I wished for it.

27:20.336 --> 27:21.302
What?

27:21.337 --> 27:22.637
Well, I don't know, Mykes.

27:22.671 --> 27:24.572
You know, it was
just a passing thought.

27:24.607 --> 27:27.675
I mean, I saw this cute kid,
and I called him buckaroo.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.444
What would that have to do
with me being pregnant?

27:29.478 --> 27:30.445
Well, I've been
thinking, you know,

27:30.480 --> 27:31.780
am I ever gonna have a family?

27:31.815 --> 27:35.217
You know, I mean, who wants
to share my insane life?

27:35.251 --> 27:38.520
And then,
I realized that someone

27:38.554 --> 27:40.522
already shares my insane life.

27:40.556 --> 27:41.790
Just stop, okay?

27:41.824 --> 27:45.393
Stop!
I will not start crying again.

27:46.962 --> 27:50.798
Okay, okay, what...
What were you in contact with

27:50.833 --> 27:52.433
when you saw that little boy?

27:52.467 --> 27:54.735
The keychain, Mykes.

27:54.770 --> 27:57.038
The keychain, it had a bunch
of things on it.

27:57.072 --> 27:59.407
Okay, okay,
then we'll find the keychain.

27:59.442 --> 28:01.042
We'll neutralize it.

28:01.076 --> 28:04.045
But first, I have to pee.

28:15.823 --> 28:17.358
Close the door!

28:20.929 --> 28:22.296
Hey, are you okay?

28:23.631 --> 28:25.266
What the hell?
I could have been shot!

28:25.300 --> 28:27.702
Yeah... I... sorry, I kinda
forgot you had the rifle.

28:27.736 --> 28:29.103
Oh, you forgot?

28:29.137 --> 28:30.538
Yeah, what are you getting
so upset about?

28:30.572 --> 28:32.173
You would have been shot,
but you're on the metronome.

28:32.207 --> 28:34.475
- You wouldn't have died.
- Yeah, but Claudia might have.

28:34.509 --> 28:35.643
Excuse me?

28:35.677 --> 28:39.613
Uh... what? No, no.
I don't know.

28:39.648 --> 28:40.748
Steve?

28:40.782 --> 28:43.116
You were saying
something about Claudia.

28:43.151 --> 28:44.117
Please, go on.

28:44.152 --> 28:47.354
All right.

28:47.388 --> 28:50.690
Ever since Claudia brought me
back, we've been...

28:50.724 --> 28:52.926
Connected.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.894
Every time I get hurt,
she feels the pain.

28:54.929 --> 28:57.164
Oh, so that's the weirdness
she was talking about.

28:57.198 --> 29:01.302
See, I was afraid that...
Something else.

29:01.336 --> 29:02.570
- Uh, she doesn't know.
- No.

29:02.604 --> 29:03.638
That's why I've been
trying to lay low.

29:03.672 --> 29:04.706
- It's to protect her.
- Yeah.

29:04.740 --> 29:05.773
We gotta get you
off that metronome.

29:05.808 --> 29:07.175
I've been looking
into it, Artie.

29:07.209 --> 29:08.376
I don't know if it's possible.

29:08.411 --> 29:11.380
At Warehouse 13,
anything's possible.

29:11.414 --> 29:12.948
You know, sometimes.

29:12.982 --> 29:14.617
Yeah, we gotta get this rifle

29:14.651 --> 29:18.620
back in the trunk
before you get Claudia shot.

29:26.797 --> 29:27.763
Guys, where is she?

29:27.797 --> 29:28.864
The one who was sitting here?

29:28.898 --> 29:29.865
She left.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.200
She was super-pissed at Mike

29:31.234 --> 29:32.601
for kissing that pretty girl.

29:32.636 --> 29:35.671
- She wasn't that pretty.
- Hey, she's pretty!

29:35.705 --> 29:38.139
Wait, you have all the fans'
names, right?

29:38.173 --> 29:40.975
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, uh...

29:41.009 --> 29:43.410
There, Judy Giltoy,
I even have her address.

29:43.445 --> 29:46.446
- Okay, just give me a push.
- Okay.

29:55.556 --> 29:57.157
They're all here.

29:57.191 --> 29:59.993
The katana sword, McCoy rifle...

30:00.028 --> 30:02.930
The Van Gogh.

30:02.964 --> 30:04.899
Mata Hari's stockings.

30:04.933 --> 30:05.900
Huh.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.802
Primo Levy's scarf.

30:08.837 --> 30:11.605
Artie Nielson,
this is your life.

30:18.446 --> 30:19.546
You okay?

30:19.580 --> 30:21.348
No, I'm not okay.

30:21.383 --> 30:22.416
This is a massive breach.

30:22.450 --> 30:23.851
Which we stopped.

30:23.885 --> 30:25.786
And as soon as everyone gets
back, we'll all track d...

30:25.820 --> 30:28.689
No, it's too dangerous to...

30:28.723 --> 30:29.990
There is a protocol.

30:30.024 --> 30:32.159
I will inform everyone
at the right time.

30:32.193 --> 30:34.795
Let's just get everything back
to the Warehouse.

30:34.829 --> 30:38.198
Artie?

30:38.233 --> 30:39.700
Those are shipping supplies.

30:39.734 --> 30:42.702
I'm not sure this is everything.

30:48.609 --> 30:50.744
Hello?

30:50.778 --> 30:52.712
Anybody home?

30:56.684 --> 30:59.186
Yup, we're definitely
in the right place.

30:59.220 --> 31:01.054
Sorry about stopping.

31:01.089 --> 31:03.057
I just so really
needed Mexican food.

31:03.091 --> 31:05.126
That other burrito
was supposed to be for me.

31:05.161 --> 31:06.394
I know.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.330
Whoa, hey, check this out.

31:08.364 --> 31:10.098
Turns out Mike did know Judy,

31:10.133 --> 31:13.736
which explains why she got
so mad about the kiss.

31:13.770 --> 31:19.842
Pete, it's the same shot of
Judy in both of these pictures.

31:19.876 --> 31:21.844
She photoshopped herself in.

31:21.878 --> 31:23.716
Yeah.

31:25.048 --> 31:27.049
All right.

31:29.153 --> 31:33.322
"John Giltoy,
beloved father and grandfather."

31:33.356 --> 31:36.059
He died recently.

31:36.093 --> 31:39.529
Oh, he was a world war ii vet.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.065
Oh, no way.

31:42.099 --> 31:44.734
He survived
the bataan death march.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.670
He and his buddy, Roy Shrop.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.571
Mykes, listen to this.

31:48.606 --> 31:52.008
"With 20 Miles remaining,
Shrop fell deathly ill.

31:52.042 --> 31:53.677
"The japanese would
have left him for dead,

31:53.711 --> 31:55.679
"but Giltoy urged him on.

31:55.713 --> 31:59.983
"'You can do this', Giltoy told
his friend, over and over."

32:00.017 --> 32:04.487
Compelled his friend to
perform an extraordinary feat.

32:04.521 --> 32:07.257
He wished so hard,
he made it true.

32:09.527 --> 32:13.363
Mykes, there were dog tags
on Judy's keys.

32:13.397 --> 32:15.732
I mean, they were probably
the grandpa's right?

32:15.766 --> 32:19.802
So we just wait here for her to
come home and snag the artifact.

32:19.837 --> 32:21.103
That's great.

32:21.138 --> 32:22.171
But I have to pee again.

32:22.205 --> 32:23.692
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:27.143 --> 32:30.044
Hey, Mike, Mike, hi.

32:30.079 --> 32:31.846
Would you get in my car,
please?

32:31.880 --> 32:34.182
Excuse me, do I know you?

32:34.216 --> 32:36.684
Mike, I need you
to get in my car.

32:36.718 --> 32:39.888
Pete, she's not coming home.

32:39.922 --> 32:41.656
There's no toothbrush
or toothpaste.

32:41.691 --> 32:43.491
The drawers are all open.

32:43.526 --> 32:44.859
She packed in a hurry.

32:44.894 --> 32:47.629
- She's gone.
- Yeah, but where?

32:47.664 --> 32:49.031
Look, I really
appreciate your...

32:49.065 --> 32:50.967
See, you shouldn't
make me do this.

32:51.001 --> 32:52.569
Then I wish your arm
wasn't healed.

32:55.906 --> 32:58.875
Let's get in my car before
I have to do your knees too.

33:03.847 --> 33:05.514
You know, start again.

33:05.549 --> 33:09.452
Hi. I'm Judy,
and I love you, Mike.

33:09.486 --> 33:11.821
And you love me.

33:11.855 --> 33:14.824
You just don't know it yet.

33:19.445 --> 33:21.512
They found his keys
and his gym bag on the ground.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.881
Security camera showed a woman
shoving him into her car,

33:23.915 --> 33:25.249
but police couldn't
read the plates.

33:25.283 --> 33:26.783
All right, uh, thanks.

33:26.818 --> 33:30.988
We'll... we'll call you
if we hear anything.

33:31.022 --> 33:32.756
Judy has abducted Mike,

33:32.791 --> 33:35.125
and the police have
no idea where they are.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.126
All right, okay.

33:36.161 --> 33:38.496
Uh... clue.

33:38.530 --> 33:40.698
Got to focus, focus.

33:40.733 --> 33:44.002
Mykes, can you do your...
Your observing thing?

33:44.036 --> 33:46.538
You know,
it's kind of hard right now.

33:46.572 --> 33:47.872
Right.

33:47.906 --> 33:50.709
Um, what about, um, what about
your female intuition?

33:50.743 --> 33:55.547
Right? I mean, you've never been
more, you know, female-y, right?

33:55.581 --> 33:58.016
So if you were an emotionally
unstable female...

33:58.050 --> 33:59.651
Not saying that you are,

33:59.685 --> 34:01.920
not saying that you are...
But if you were,

34:01.954 --> 34:05.157
where would you take him?

34:05.191 --> 34:07.959
There.

34:07.994 --> 34:11.596
Grandpa left Judy
the dog tags, his ashes,

34:11.630 --> 34:13.864
and I bet that he left her
that cabin too.

34:13.899 --> 34:16.900
We'll get the address
from Artie on the way.

34:25.309 --> 34:27.844
Hi.

34:27.878 --> 34:32.248
I made us some hot cider.
Hmm?

34:34.451 --> 34:38.120
Oh, isn't this romantic?

34:38.154 --> 34:39.554
Hi.

34:39.589 --> 34:40.857
How you feeling?

34:40.891 --> 34:43.426
Better.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.460
After you fixed my arm.

34:44.494 --> 34:47.063
Again.
Ha ha.

34:47.097 --> 34:49.264
You're welcome.

34:49.300 --> 34:52.201
Oh, Mike, oh,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.

34:52.235 --> 34:56.940
I have done so much for you.

34:56.974 --> 35:00.109
Now, my plan was to wait until
after the championships

35:00.144 --> 35:04.947
to tell you, but then I saw you
kissing that woman.

35:04.982 --> 35:08.918
See, I've been cheering you
all season long, Mike.

35:08.953 --> 35:12.588
Wishing you to shoot faster
and skate harder

35:12.622 --> 35:14.891
and throw that guy
through the glass.

35:14.925 --> 35:18.227
Oh, and you didn't even
know we were a team.

35:18.261 --> 35:21.698
- I did not.
- I know.

35:21.732 --> 35:22.965
So, uh, what do you
want from me?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.202
Um, well...

35:26.236 --> 35:29.138
We could start
with a kiss.

35:30.607 --> 35:31.641
Okay...

35:33.110 --> 35:35.511
Yeah.
Close your eyes.

35:35.546 --> 35:37.513
Mm.

35:47.224 --> 35:51.193
You are gonna wish
you didn't do that.

36:07.498 --> 36:11.080
Whatever you're doing,
stop, please.

36:11.115 --> 36:12.248
My legs.

36:12.283 --> 36:13.349
Oh, now see, that's the pain

36:13.384 --> 36:14.884
that you would
have felt every day

36:14.918 --> 36:17.186
if I hadn't wished it away.

36:17.221 --> 36:19.622
Wish it away again.
Please.

36:19.657 --> 36:22.158
Um, no, I'm sorry.

36:22.192 --> 36:24.794
Not until you learn to behave.

36:29.066 --> 36:32.268
Shh!

36:32.302 --> 36:34.270
Quiet.

36:38.237 --> 36:41.245
Damn it, what's he doing here?

36:43.748 --> 36:46.049
Shh!

36:52.991 --> 36:54.959
Ow! Ow!

36:54.993 --> 36:56.394
Hey, are you all right?

36:56.428 --> 36:57.929
Not really.

36:57.963 --> 36:59.230
She went out back,
she's got an axe.

36:59.265 --> 37:01.566
Well, never a dull moment.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.668
Dude, your leg's not supposed
to bend like that.

37:03.702 --> 37:05.670
I know!

37:09.852 --> 37:11.910
Judy?

37:11.945 --> 37:14.179
- Pete!
- Mykes?!

37:14.214 --> 37:16.315
I don't know
how you people found me,

37:16.349 --> 37:18.250
but I am not in
the mood for this!

37:18.285 --> 37:20.052
Oh, my God, how much perfume
are you wearing?

37:20.086 --> 37:21.787
I'm gonna... I'm gonna puke.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.023
- Hey!
- Shoot her, Pete!

37:24.058 --> 37:25.825
I don't have a shot, Mykes.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.161
Drop your gun,
or I hurt your fat friend.

37:28.196 --> 37:29.563
- Hey!
- All right, just...

37:29.597 --> 37:31.631
Hey, g-go easy, okay?

37:31.665 --> 37:34.267
Obviously my friend
is pregnant and harmless.

37:34.301 --> 37:37.802
She tried to shoot me
with that weird gun.

37:37.837 --> 37:40.805
I dropped the tesla,
and I couldn't pick it up.

37:45.477 --> 37:46.644
Okay?

37:46.678 --> 37:48.679
We're both unarmed.

37:48.713 --> 37:50.614
We'll get in the car
and forget this ever happened.

37:50.649 --> 37:51.782
No, you won't.

37:51.816 --> 37:53.951
You're gonna go get the police.

37:53.985 --> 37:57.621
Which is why I now have to
take care of this.

37:57.656 --> 38:00.458
You really
shouldn't have come.

38:00.492 --> 38:02.994
I wish your lungs
would collapse.

38:04.663 --> 38:05.796
No!

38:05.831 --> 38:09.734
I wish you were taking
your last breath.

38:09.768 --> 38:12.804
Pete!

38:15.668 --> 38:17.542
Pete!

38:19.212 --> 38:21.413
Pete!

38:21.448 --> 38:25.217
No!

38:25.251 --> 38:27.619
Nice try, misery!

38:27.654 --> 38:28.854
Surprise!

38:28.888 --> 38:31.223
Back at ya!

38:35.388 --> 38:37.086
I hooked it with my toe.

38:37.121 --> 38:39.086
Ha ha.
That's right.

38:39.121 --> 38:40.921
Don't mess with the mama bear.

38:40.955 --> 38:43.290
Oh, my God, Pete.

38:43.324 --> 38:45.025
Pete, I think I just
peed myself a little.

38:45.059 --> 38:48.527
Just... Pete, hurry,
bag the artifact, quick!

38:48.561 --> 38:50.328
Yeah, yes, yes.

38:50.363 --> 38:52.996
- Pete, quick!
- Hold on!

38:59.711 --> 39:01.345
Oh, my God.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.346
Oh, my God.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.149
I-I got my body back!

39:05.183 --> 39:07.517
I have a stomach
and a waist and hips.

39:07.552 --> 39:08.685
It's all good!

39:08.720 --> 39:10.387
It's goodie good good good!

39:15.191 --> 39:17.724
Oh, my God,
I should go check on Mike.

39:17.758 --> 39:18.959
Eh?

39:18.993 --> 39:20.026
You go, girl.

39:20.060 --> 39:21.060
Hey.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.641
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:28.675 --> 39:31.076
So, uh, how's Mike?

39:31.110 --> 39:32.077
He's okay.

39:32.111 --> 39:34.213
Hockey players can, uh,

39:34.247 --> 39:36.315
- really handle pain.
- Mm.

39:36.349 --> 39:38.517
And you?

39:38.551 --> 39:41.559
Well, only my romantic comedy

39:41.593 --> 39:43.762
would turn into
a Steven king movie, so...

39:43.796 --> 39:45.565
Pretty good twist
at the end, though.

39:45.599 --> 39:48.102
Yeah, how did you know
to fake your own death?

39:48.137 --> 39:49.237
I don't know.

39:49.271 --> 39:52.039
I just... after Judy
made her wish, right?

39:52.073 --> 39:54.508
I realized that
I could still breathe.

39:54.543 --> 39:57.045
Of course, you know,
she had an axe to your throat,

39:57.079 --> 39:59.514
so I just kinda... went with it.

39:59.549 --> 40:01.283
So why didn't
the wishing work?

40:01.317 --> 40:02.718
I've been thinking
about that too.

40:02.753 --> 40:06.989
Maybe the dogtags just work
on people that you love, right?

40:07.024 --> 40:10.593
Um, like, Judy's grandpa
used it on his army buddy,

40:10.628 --> 40:14.397
Judy used it on Mike,
I used it on y...

40:14.432 --> 40:18.268
Do I... do I have a booger?

40:18.302 --> 40:19.269
Oh, no.

40:19.303 --> 40:20.637
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:20.672 --> 40:22.006
Look closely.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.677
You just admitted
that you love me.

40:24.712 --> 40:30.350
Oh, Myke, I also love fajitas
and cage fighting

40:30.384 --> 40:32.819
and bald women...
I mean, Sinead o'Connor?

40:32.854 --> 40:35.222
That's a nice try,
Lattimer, okay?

40:35.256 --> 40:38.793
But face it,
I wield tremendous power.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.863
- Yes, you wield the power.
- I do.

40:41.897 --> 40:45.600
Look, for the record,
when it happens for real,

40:45.634 --> 40:48.670
I think that you'll make
a pretty great mom.

40:48.705 --> 40:51.039
Really?

40:51.073 --> 40:54.342
Yeah.

40:54.377 --> 40:57.379
I mean, look at the way
you protected me today.

40:59.286 --> 41:02.589
And... I mean,
you're really good at nagging.

41:02.624 --> 41:04.825
- We should get going.
- See?

41:04.859 --> 41:07.294
I'm just... I'm gonna
go say good-bye to Mike.

41:07.329 --> 41:10.364
I'm not gonna go say good-bye
to Mike because, I mean,

41:10.398 --> 41:12.467
how many different ways
can this movie end?

41:12.501 --> 41:15.070
You know, I'm all
out of you go, girls.

41:15.104 --> 41:18.073
Gonna be talk to
the hand from now on.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.684
Is this another
artifact being created?

41:28.718 --> 41:31.721
Because I don't sense anything.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.025
Oh.

41:36.059 --> 41:38.261
Is that Mr. Frederic?

41:38.295 --> 41:39.628
Yes.

41:39.663 --> 41:42.031
He's my grandson.

41:42.065 --> 41:44.667
But he's...

41:44.701 --> 41:47.702
So you're son is...

41:47.737 --> 41:49.737
Long gone.

41:53.308 --> 41:56.277
Not all wonder
is endless, Claudia.
