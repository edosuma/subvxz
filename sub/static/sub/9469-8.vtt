04:03.781 --> 04:05.866
We're killing now?

04:06.033 --> 04:08.202
We should have made them
dig their own graves first.

04:10.204 --> 04:12.665
That's dark.

04:12.790 --> 04:15.668
Fucking sun will be up
soon, we're getting nowhere.

04:15.793 --> 04:18.587
Hey, how about a little help?

04:18.712 --> 04:22.007
I'm getting these treatments.
Makes me feel like shit.

04:23.592 --> 04:27.513
- You're all right?
- No. Something I gotta do.

04:31.642 --> 04:33.686
I'm getting gene therapy from Pryce.

04:33.811 --> 04:36.939
It's supposed to make my DNA... normal.

04:37.064 --> 04:39.817
When you say "normal", you mean...?

04:39.942 --> 04:43.445
Normal. Human.

04:50.369 --> 04:52.330
Why?

04:52.454 --> 04:54.456
You got a couple hours
to kill? Pull up a chair.

04:57.001 --> 04:59.253
My husband can't even talk no more.

05:06.135 --> 05:08.304
You gotta arrest this guy!

05:12.350 --> 05:14.518
Can you describe the assailant?

05:14.643 --> 05:17.063
The rich boy.

05:17.188 --> 05:19.565
His daddy used to own
the town or some shit.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.859
Roman Godfrey did this to him?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.796
- Keys.
- What?

05:42.922 --> 05:45.258
I'll get the car.

06:05.736 --> 06:08.281
Hey!

06:10.408 --> 06:13.119
- You don't need to go there.
- I'm all right.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.246
I got it handled.

06:18.456 --> 06:21.377
Maybe I should get the car.

06:23.379 --> 06:26.424
Is he alive?

06:33.055 --> 06:35.057
Fucking shit.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.445
Help me.

06:49.822 --> 06:51.615
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- Uh...

06:53.575 --> 06:56.329
- We gotta turn her in to Chasseur.
- You're kidding?

06:56.454 --> 06:59.206
- What else can we do?
- Not implicate ourselves in that.

06:59.332 --> 07:01.708
They're serial killers.
We acted in self-defense.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.836
We get dragged into this, it means a trial,

07:03.961 --> 07:06.401
reporters sniffing around stuff
that's none of their business.

07:06.464 --> 07:09.216
We're already hip deep in this.

07:09.342 --> 07:11.302
Not if we don't tell anyone.

07:15.431 --> 07:18.934
You're not proposing...
that we kill her now.

07:19.059 --> 07:23.439
Shit... And you thought I was dark.

07:23.563 --> 07:25.941
What if there are more of
them? She gets a message out.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.361
They show up at my front
door looking for payback.

07:28.486 --> 07:30.696
Baby's there, man.

07:32.781 --> 07:35.159
Let's just find out what she knows first.

07:35.284 --> 07:37.119
Fine. All right.

07:52.926 --> 07:55.346
Qubits are fully entangled.

08:05.272 --> 08:07.712
An apparent diffusion coefficient
in the white matter regions.

08:17.701 --> 08:20.079
Check the epigenic neuron states.

08:40.307 --> 08:42.434
Shelley?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.853
- Did it work?
- Beautifully.

08:44.978 --> 08:48.148
We've uploaded your neural
networks to the server.

08:48.274 --> 08:50.150
Now what?

08:50.276 --> 08:53.112
Well, I need you to do one thing.

08:53.237 --> 08:56.823
I need you to take a
long, relaxing bubble bath

08:56.949 --> 09:00.327
when I begin Phase Two, the
download to the replacement anatomy.

09:00.453 --> 09:04.039
It'll have my brain?

09:04.164 --> 09:07.126
Not your physical brain. Your mind,

09:07.293 --> 09:11.338
your thoughts, memories, your personality.

09:13.882 --> 09:16.302
Will it like Brussels sprouts?

09:18.178 --> 09:21.098
Not if you don't.

09:21.223 --> 09:24.101
It will become you.

09:26.103 --> 09:29.731
Now, we will observe this
replacement anatomy for 36 hours,

09:29.856 --> 09:32.443
to ensure that no corrupt
data has entered its...

09:32.568 --> 09:34.694
...your system.

09:36.655 --> 09:39.366
What's Phase Three?

09:39.492 --> 09:41.452
That's when we jettison the host anatomy.

09:41.577 --> 09:43.745
You mean me.

09:43.912 --> 09:48.750
No, what's you is that
mind that I love so dearly.

09:48.875 --> 09:53.130
You will live on.

09:53.255 --> 09:56.216
This broken body is just a chrysalis.

09:56.342 --> 09:58.218
You will soon be the butterfly.

09:58.344 --> 10:02.598
But this me would be safe here.

10:02.722 --> 10:04.724
It would not.

10:04.850 --> 10:07.311
The authorities will get a warrant

10:07.436 --> 10:10.230
to search the White Tower.

10:10.356 --> 10:13.317
It would be better for the police to find

10:13.442 --> 10:15.653
your old anatomy out
in the woods somewhere.

10:15.777 --> 10:19.239
That way, they'll close
the case once and for all.

10:20.991 --> 10:22.993
You'll just drift off.

10:23.118 --> 10:26.288
I'll hold your hand.

10:26.413 --> 10:29.458
The last thing you'll see is my face.

10:43.930 --> 10:49.019
I've thought about this a
hundred times as your doctor,

10:49.144 --> 10:53.232
your benefactor and,
dare I say, your friend.

10:54.358 --> 10:57.152
This is the prudent thing to do...

10:57.319 --> 10:59.363
...Shelley.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.367
OK.

11:10.583 --> 11:13.126
Let's begin Phase Two, shall we?

11:15.837 --> 11:17.214
Who are you?

11:17.339 --> 11:19.425
What's your fucking name?!

11:19.550 --> 11:22.177
What are you? How were you
a wolf and now you're...

11:22.302 --> 11:24.304
No, you answer, you don't ask!

11:24.430 --> 11:28.058
My name is Sarah... I think.

11:28.183 --> 11:30.269
You think?

11:31.895 --> 11:35.148
- Is he really dead?
- Who?

11:40.153 --> 11:44.074
I'm Sarah Chase. 813 Auburn Lane,

11:44.199 --> 11:48.786
Valencia, California. I'm Sarah Chase...

11:48.912 --> 11:51.998
I haven't said that in ten years.

11:54.167 --> 11:57.045
Thank you. Thank you...

11:57.170 --> 11:59.047
Who is that?

11:59.172 --> 12:01.717
He made us call him "John Bone".

12:01.841 --> 12:05.512
He kidnapped me from my bedroom
while my parents were sleeping.

12:05.638 --> 12:09.849
He had a group in the desert, in Utah.

12:09.975 --> 12:13.395
Some of the others were kidnapped too.

12:13.562 --> 12:16.898
He thought killing families
would bring the Apocalypse...

12:18.776 --> 12:20.944
...and that God would
come down from heaven...

12:21.069 --> 12:23.614
You could have run away any time
you wanted, even here in the forest.

12:23.739 --> 12:25.616
He would have killed me!

12:25.741 --> 12:27.825
He killed so many of us.

12:27.951 --> 12:29.995
He made the rest watch.

12:33.915 --> 12:35.626
I really don't feel good.

12:37.795 --> 12:41.131
Our car is parked just up the road.

12:43.925 --> 12:48.430
- Can I ask you one thing, please?
- What?

12:48.555 --> 12:51.475
If I die...

12:51.642 --> 12:54.144
...will you tell my mom...

12:54.269 --> 12:56.647
...I was sorry?

12:58.732 --> 13:00.526
Peter.

13:11.704 --> 13:13.831
She knew all the names,
addresses, all those details.

13:13.955 --> 13:16.958
So could anyone else. It's all on the Web.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.210
It looks just like her.

13:19.712 --> 13:23.006
This... group, or whatever they are,

13:23.131 --> 13:25.843
they know what they're doing.
They obviously have a plan.

13:26.009 --> 13:28.595
This is part of it? Look at her.

13:28.762 --> 13:30.597
You think she's capable
of running game on us?

13:30.723 --> 13:33.559
She's a mess.

13:33.684 --> 13:37.062
I don't care how crazy these fuckers
are, it was still her choice to murder.

13:37.187 --> 13:39.648
That twisted fuck became
like a father to her.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.650
When someone's tapped in that deep,

13:41.775 --> 13:43.443
and they tell you to do
something terrible... whatever...

13:43.569 --> 13:45.153
it's not a choice.

13:49.533 --> 13:52.327
OK. I'll go get her
car, she says it's close.

14:00.918 --> 14:02.504
Lights.

14:27.821 --> 14:30.282
She fucking killed my wife.

14:32.826 --> 14:37.163
She fucking killed my
wife. Marie died right here.

14:37.289 --> 14:39.374
Yeah.

14:39.499 --> 14:41.460
And dragged her body to the upstairs bath.

14:41.585 --> 14:43.629
Everything she's done...

14:45.589 --> 14:48.508
...everything I've
allowed to happen ends now.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.093
We got her.

14:50.218 --> 14:52.971
We got nothing.

14:53.096 --> 14:56.642
Well, what more evidence do you
need? All this blood in her house.

14:56.767 --> 15:00.186
- This is not blood.
- What?

15:00.312 --> 15:02.021
Yeah. Look at the wipe marks.

15:02.147 --> 15:04.357
Smell it. It's bleach.

15:04.483 --> 15:07.986
Bleach lights up under
luminol, same as blood.

15:10.029 --> 15:12.741
What's scarier is I
didn't spray the luminol.

15:12.866 --> 15:15.201
It was already here. Means
it was done by professionals,

15:15.327 --> 15:17.329
cleaners you call in after a hit.

15:17.454 --> 15:19.414
They lit this place up to make
sure they didn't miss anything.

15:19.581 --> 15:22.960
- Well, maybe they missed a spot.
- Guys like this don't fuck up.

15:23.084 --> 15:25.504
We're not gonna find any of Marie's DNA.

15:25.629 --> 15:29.257
But... I mean, just the fact
that they cleaned this place out,

15:29.382 --> 15:33.470
- doesn't that prove something?
- Yeah, that she cleans her house.

15:33.595 --> 15:35.595
Look, if you go to the
cops with this, all it does,

15:35.681 --> 15:38.600
it gives Olivia the heads-up.
Then you'll be in her crosshairs.

15:49.903 --> 15:52.197
I'll handle it myself.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.659
- Walk away, Norman.
- She's not even a human being.

15:55.784 --> 15:58.119
Her DNA tests prove it.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.461
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

16:06.586 --> 16:09.006
I grew up around Santeria.

16:09.130 --> 16:12.551
No matter how much Eleggua oil you wear,

16:12.676 --> 16:15.053
the brujas will get you
dead if you cross 'em.

16:15.178 --> 16:16.722
What do you suggest I do?

16:18.515 --> 16:20.308
Turn the other ass cheek

16:20.433 --> 16:23.311
and spend my golden
years with that monster?

16:23.436 --> 16:25.230
Tell her you need some time.

16:27.691 --> 16:31.152
Letha, the baby, Marie...

16:31.277 --> 16:33.238
...it's all hitting you.

16:35.991 --> 16:39.202
Let some time go by, then...

16:39.327 --> 16:41.454
...break it off, start a new life.

16:43.582 --> 16:46.125
Just don't ever let on you know.

16:49.713 --> 16:52.591
Who are you looking forward
to seeing, huh? Your parents?

16:52.716 --> 16:55.928
- They're gonna hate me.
- They'll understand.

16:58.513 --> 17:01.683
My mom was pregnant. I don't
even know my sister's name.

17:04.394 --> 17:06.521
There you go. You're gonna
meet your little sister.

17:06.646 --> 17:08.607
That'll be the best day of your life.

17:13.486 --> 17:16.698
I'm thirsty. Can I have a pop?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.577
- Who the fuck are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:20.702 --> 17:22.746
- I'm Sarah...
- Bullshit! Who are you?

17:22.871 --> 17:24.455
- Peter!
- She's not from California,

17:24.580 --> 17:26.916
she's not from Utah! She
asked for a pop, not a soda!

17:27.041 --> 17:28.961
- Only people from the Midwest say that.
- Chill out! Jesus!

17:29.086 --> 17:31.797
Maybe her best friend from
the cult was from Omaha. Relax!

17:31.922 --> 17:35.216
- Peter, you're sick, man, from turning.
- Shut up!

17:35.341 --> 17:37.970
Calm down, OK? Let her go.

17:38.095 --> 17:41.473
Let her go. Let her go.

17:41.598 --> 17:43.976
Let her go!

17:44.101 --> 17:47.353
It's affecting your
judgment. You're not yourself.

17:53.192 --> 17:55.445
You stabbed her over a fucking soda?!

17:55.570 --> 17:57.489
She was reaching for
something. What was it?

18:06.331 --> 18:07.749
Get down!

18:12.838 --> 18:14.589
The Caul.

18:14.714 --> 18:17.717
You can't stop us.

18:30.355 --> 18:32.440
What if you'd been wrong about the grenade?

18:32.565 --> 18:35.110
I wasn't.

18:39.656 --> 18:42.617
Fuck.

18:46.663 --> 18:49.207
You should be kissing our asses!

18:49.332 --> 18:51.250
We delivered you a
couple of serial killers!

18:51.376 --> 18:54.004
You could get a ticker-tape
parade down Hemlock Avenue!

18:54.129 --> 18:55.254
On your knees, hands behind your head.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.423
Is this why you want to get me out of town?

18:57.549 --> 18:59.634
I came to you about these people. Look
at them. Why would they wearing masks?

18:59.759 --> 19:02.012
Have body armor? Have a car
filled with weapons and explosives?

19:02.137 --> 19:04.181
On your knees.

19:43.053 --> 19:45.138
What are you doing?

19:51.310 --> 19:53.230
This didn't happen, understand?

19:55.523 --> 19:57.764
Either of you breathes a word,
you end up like these two.

20:25.178 --> 20:27.139
Damn it!

21:05.135 --> 21:08.554
And that's why we don't touch
things we're not supposed to.

21:11.474 --> 21:14.811
- Mind if I take a shower?
- Mi casa and shit.

21:17.814 --> 21:20.566
I gotta make a run to the White Tower.

21:20.692 --> 21:22.735
Work stuff.

21:32.453 --> 21:34.455
The baby, where is she?

21:34.622 --> 21:36.666
- She took her.
- My mother?

21:36.791 --> 21:38.835
- The girl, Miranda.
- Where did she go?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.419
Why didn't you stop her?

21:40.545 --> 21:43.756
I dozed off. They were gone when I woke up.

21:43.882 --> 21:45.591
Maybe she just took her to the doctor.

21:45.717 --> 21:49.095
With diapers and toys? She's gone.

21:49.221 --> 21:52.140
I warned you about her.
You wouldn't listen.

21:56.269 --> 21:58.938
- It's voice mail.
- We need to find her, Peter.

21:59.064 --> 22:00.899
We need to find the baby.

22:01.024 --> 22:02.775
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

22:05.111 --> 22:07.197
What?

22:29.886 --> 22:34.431
Oh, um, I'll have the pancakes.

22:36.142 --> 22:37.769
Wait! Um, no, I'll just take a coffee.

22:37.894 --> 22:40.063
Coffee's on me. Pancakes too.

22:40.188 --> 22:42.023
Is it my sweater?

22:42.148 --> 22:45.068
However unpleasant they are as
people, the Norwegians are skilled

22:45.193 --> 22:47.612
at managing their animal warmth. May I?

22:49.364 --> 22:52.491
My wife, the architect, she gets to
stay on the slopes a few more days

22:52.617 --> 22:56.662
while I head back to the planet Earth
to heal the sick and raise the dead!

22:56.788 --> 23:02.085
So, the famous baby.

23:02.210 --> 23:05.004
- Can I hold her?
- I can't get her to stop.

23:15.307 --> 23:18.184
Wow! I'm impressed.

23:18.310 --> 23:21.396
I have an uncanny ability to put
people to sleep with my personality.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.523
Useful with infants, but not
so good at dinner parties.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.282
What are you running away from, Miranda?

23:35.785 --> 23:38.037
Excuse me?

23:38.163 --> 23:41.916
You've been crying, you've ditched
your veganism for comfort food

23:42.041 --> 23:43.835
along with a boatload of cholesterol.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.587
And you're, you're far away from
home with a baby that's not your own.

23:46.712 --> 23:51.634
- How can I help?
- No, no. Really, um, I'm fine.

23:51.759 --> 23:55.347
Yeah? I'm also a living,
breathing lie detector.

23:55.472 --> 23:58.557
I don't know what you're going through,

23:58.683 --> 23:59.767
but there's got to be someone you can call.

23:59.892 --> 24:01.518
Talk this out with them, whatever it is.

24:04.605 --> 24:07.859
Human beings are not designed
to function in isolation.

24:07.984 --> 24:10.069
Really, um, I'm fine.

24:10.195 --> 24:13.114
Actually, I, uh, I'm late for something.

24:13.239 --> 24:16.201
So, uh, I gotta go.

24:20.997 --> 24:23.208
Dr. Spivak?

24:29.088 --> 24:31.424
You need to come in to the
office for a follow-up, OK?

24:31.548 --> 24:33.426
Call Pearl, get something on the books.

24:33.510 --> 24:35.928
Sure, sure. Yeah, tomorrow
morning first thing.

24:36.054 --> 24:37.889
OK...

24:43.853 --> 24:46.898
Honestly, there's no need
for all this rigamarole.

24:47.023 --> 24:49.192
You won't be saying
that if you broke a rib.

24:49.317 --> 24:53.363
Probably sprained something
because my immunity is down.

24:53.488 --> 24:56.115
Why the hell is it taking so long
for me to get back to normal, Johann?

24:56.241 --> 24:58.117
We've been through this
any number of times.

24:58.243 --> 25:01.079
And we'll keep going over it
until you do something about it.

25:01.204 --> 25:05.542
It's just a mild contusion, but
the costophrenic angle is clear.

25:05.666 --> 25:08.627
Well, that's not what I expected.

25:08.753 --> 25:10.505
Doctor?

25:18.721 --> 25:22.350
Stop talking in that horrid
language and get me out of here!

25:37.115 --> 25:41.660
In your anterior mediastinum, you have
a two-by-four-centimeter round mass.

25:41.786 --> 25:44.581
Mass? What kind of mass?

25:44.705 --> 25:47.208
Hard to say.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.834
Make it go away.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.795
There's gotta be something
you can do about the mass.

25:50.920 --> 25:55.133
- About everything.
- I'm referring you to an oncologist.

25:55.258 --> 25:57.427
Good man. Extremely competent.

26:00.221 --> 26:02.098
We don't get cancer.

26:20.992 --> 26:22.827
Shit!

26:29.834 --> 26:31.668
Damnit!

26:35.590 --> 26:37.342
We should go to the White Tower.

26:39.010 --> 26:42.305
It was in the dream.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.056
Roman, I need to talk to you.

26:46.559 --> 26:48.645
I'll get rid of him.

26:57.903 --> 27:00.323
I just saw this DNA test on Olivia.

27:03.618 --> 27:05.911
I'm worried about you, Roman.

27:08.039 --> 27:11.167
Listen, there's this, um...

27:11.334 --> 27:15.796
...European folklore thing... behind it.

27:15.921 --> 27:17.423
Something real, I guess.

27:17.549 --> 27:19.008
It's all true.

27:21.427 --> 27:23.262
Does, does that mean that, that...

27:23.388 --> 27:25.431
I am, too.

27:25.557 --> 27:27.892
Was Marie...?

27:28.017 --> 27:30.520
Did Olivia kill her?

27:30.645 --> 27:32.855
I don't know.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.732
Is she capable of it?

27:35.858 --> 27:37.402
What do you think?

27:41.947 --> 27:43.782
Anyway, fuck her!

27:43.908 --> 27:45.784
I just want her to leave me alone.

27:45.910 --> 27:47.953
You're not.

27:48.079 --> 27:49.788
Alone, I mean.

27:53.251 --> 27:55.294
Look, I really don't have
the bandwidth for this.

27:57.422 --> 28:00.925
I'm... I'm your father, Roman.

28:04.470 --> 28:07.223
What's it like to
finally say that out loud?

28:07.348 --> 28:09.308
I wasn't sure...

28:09.434 --> 28:11.603
I wasn't sure.

28:11.728 --> 28:14.021
And yet, I always knew.

28:14.146 --> 28:17.191
Denial, cognitive dissonance...

28:19.318 --> 28:21.237
...adaptive traits in our family.

28:21.362 --> 28:23.239
We'd all go fucking crazy otherwise...

28:23.364 --> 28:25.283
Oh! And none of us are crazy now?

28:25.408 --> 28:27.744
I should have admitted
it to you a long time ago.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.746
That you fucked your brother's wife?

28:29.870 --> 28:32.540
Dumped Marie? Destroyed
your own family? What?

28:35.334 --> 28:38.630
I should have been a father to you somehow.

28:40.256 --> 28:43.259
My father was a great man...

28:43.384 --> 28:45.386
A visionary.

28:45.511 --> 28:49.599
He saved this town, probably the county.

28:49.724 --> 28:51.601
And I knew he always loved me.

28:53.311 --> 28:55.229
He did love me, you know?

28:57.148 --> 28:58.816
So me not knowing?

29:00.151 --> 29:02.361
You did me a favor.

29:09.786 --> 29:11.746
You OK?

29:11.870 --> 29:14.915
Actually, yeah.

29:20.588 --> 29:21.588
Hello?

29:21.589 --> 29:24.759
You stupid fucks better get the
fuck over here right fucking now.

29:37.772 --> 29:39.315
Found this on one of the bodies.

29:44.195 --> 29:45.697
It's not possible.

29:45.822 --> 29:49.492
My sister had that same symbol
on one of the rings she wore.

29:49.617 --> 29:51.118
Looks a lot like this thing.

29:53.996 --> 29:55.790
Somebody trying to look like us.

29:57.709 --> 30:01.295
- That's not helpful.
- We don't operate death squads.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.673
Every organization has its dissidents.

30:03.798 --> 30:06.008
I'll handle it, I promise.

30:06.133 --> 30:09.303
I'll contact you as soon as
I know something. Anything.

30:09.428 --> 30:11.639
Clean yourself up.

30:24.610 --> 30:26.654
Now put the fucking
chancellor on the phone.

30:28.656 --> 30:30.575
Hello, Francis.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.869
- How are you?
- Not well.

30:32.993 --> 30:36.372
I think we have a rogue element in the OOD,

30:36.497 --> 30:39.458
linked to a series of murders
throughout the Northeast.

30:39.584 --> 30:42.253
I doubt that very much.

30:42.378 --> 30:44.978
You know as well as I do there
are extremists in the organization,

30:45.005 --> 30:47.174
and you know who they are.

30:47.299 --> 30:50.386
People are entitled to
their views, Francis.

30:50.511 --> 30:53.222
Not if people are killing children.

30:53.347 --> 30:55.933
Now, you will do something
about this or I...

30:56.100 --> 30:59.144
- I'll look into it.
- Do not patronize me.

30:59.270 --> 31:01.439
I don't care how much you outrank me;

31:01.564 --> 31:03.941
I will go to the FBI if I have to.

31:05.526 --> 31:07.236
I'll need specifics.

31:07.361 --> 31:10.364
Dates, times, and whatever
sources you may have.

31:10.489 --> 31:12.324
I'm sending an envoy right away.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.474
Hi.

31:36.599 --> 31:38.559
Hi.

31:38.684 --> 31:41.103
You sound...

31:41.228 --> 31:44.356
Like you? You sound like me.

31:44.482 --> 31:46.901
What's it like?

31:47.025 --> 31:49.361
It's beautiful.

31:49.487 --> 31:51.196
Can I?

31:51.322 --> 31:52.990
Of course.

32:03.793 --> 32:05.795
Beautiful.

32:08.506 --> 32:10.675
You don't have to do this.

32:10.842 --> 32:12.844
You could stay in the White Tower

32:12.969 --> 32:15.763
on the tippy-top floor,
like our favorite...

32:15.888 --> 32:17.640
This isn't the Plaza Hotel.

32:17.765 --> 32:19.642
I'm not Eloise.

32:19.767 --> 32:22.645
I could come visit all the
time. We could be like sisters.

32:22.770 --> 32:27.191
I mean, even closer than
sisters have ever been.

32:27.316 --> 32:29.527
I'm a chrysalis.

32:29.652 --> 32:32.070
Don't just repeat what
Uncle Johann told you.

32:32.196 --> 32:34.615
You'll be gone.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.617
Not if you're here.

32:38.452 --> 32:40.663
You've never seen
yourself from the outside.

32:40.788 --> 32:42.665
I have.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.750
Everything Mom always said,

32:44.876 --> 32:47.003
it wasn't true. You're beautiful.

32:47.127 --> 32:49.005
In a different way, but...

32:49.171 --> 32:51.007
I've seen you now too.

32:53.968 --> 32:56.012
I'm not going back.

33:01.851 --> 33:03.519
OK.

33:03.644 --> 33:07.105
Can I? Just for a little bit?

33:07.231 --> 33:08.733
Yes.

33:24.206 --> 33:26.375
I love you.

33:32.048 --> 33:34.258
So, you eat blood?

33:34.383 --> 33:36.510
It's not "eating" per se,

33:36.635 --> 33:38.554
it's, uh, it's sort of a feeding...

33:38.679 --> 33:41.599
- Oh, God, listen to yourself.
- And you maul people to death?

33:41.724 --> 33:43.976
No, I don't actually.
I was defending myself.

33:44.101 --> 33:46.729
And what neither of you know is
that Roman hates the way he is.

33:46.854 --> 33:49.189
He's getting treatments.

33:51.442 --> 33:53.611
- You stay away from that baby!
- Excuse me?

33:53.736 --> 33:56.822
- You killed two people. Why?
- They were from the dreams!

33:56.948 --> 33:59.283
- I KNEW IT! I told you to stay away!
- Will you put the knife down?

33:59.408 --> 34:02.327
You're not going to stab us.

34:02.453 --> 34:04.329
Don't push it.

34:04.496 --> 34:08.083
Miranda, you had the dream too.
So you recognized the house, right?

34:08.208 --> 34:10.210
The kid? The guy in the mask?

34:10.335 --> 34:13.839
The bees? We had to do it. Tell her!

34:13.965 --> 34:15.645
They really tried to kill that little boy?

34:15.757 --> 34:18.176
- Killed at least six that we know about.
- So far.

34:18.302 --> 34:20.304
Who are they? I mean, why am I
even having the same dreams as you?

34:20.429 --> 34:23.474
We don't know. And I'm sorry that I lied.

34:23.599 --> 34:26.978
But we're getting these
dreams for a reason.

34:27.103 --> 34:29.396
You're not gonna give this up, are you?

34:29.521 --> 34:31.440
- We can't.
- Then you're an idiot.

34:31.565 --> 34:33.400
And so am I.

34:33.525 --> 34:35.860
So you're gonna help?

34:35.987 --> 34:37.989
Well, I don't see that
I have any other choice

34:38.114 --> 34:40.741
under the circumstances.

34:52.168 --> 34:55.380
So, the dream was, um, clearest
when we were with Miranda.

34:55.505 --> 34:58.050
- OK, I can use that.
- Hold on. What do you want me to do?

34:58.175 --> 35:01.095
- I'm freaking out here.
- Well, it's about to get a lot freakier.

35:01.219 --> 35:04.389
So if you want out, now is your chance.

35:04.515 --> 35:07.267
We need you. Please.

35:09.145 --> 35:11.605
The Femeia Inecata might work.

35:11.730 --> 35:13.565
Come on.

35:13.691 --> 35:15.192
What, the bathtub again?

35:15.317 --> 35:16.902
Yeah, but this time,
it's a little different.

35:17.028 --> 35:18.863
You have to drown me.

35:24.785 --> 35:27.955
So, Pryce tells me it's a
thymoma, which has a good chance...

35:28.080 --> 35:30.290
It's not. It's an acute lymphoma.

35:30.415 --> 35:34.545
- Which means what?
- It's a form of cancer that affects...

35:34.670 --> 35:37.297
What I want to know is...

35:37.422 --> 35:40.009
...how do we get rid of it?
What's involved in curing me?

35:40.134 --> 35:42.887
We don't speak of cures.

35:43.012 --> 35:45.430
Remission is a more useful term.

35:45.556 --> 35:47.432
Five-year survival rates...

35:50.144 --> 35:53.647
Just... just put it in
terms I can understand.

35:53.772 --> 35:56.942
A number, odds, whatever.

35:57.109 --> 36:00.863
Well, given the stage,
I'd say... 20 percent.

36:00.988 --> 36:02.990
That it could get worse?

36:03.115 --> 36:05.910
There's a 20 percent chance you'll survive.

36:06.035 --> 36:07.870
Twenty?

36:09.747 --> 36:12.208
I don't want to get your
hopes up unreasonably.

36:12.332 --> 36:15.002
Treatment involves a surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation.

36:15.127 --> 36:17.337
We're doing some very interesting work

36:17.462 --> 36:20.174
with bone marrow and stem cell transplants.

36:20.298 --> 36:22.509
I'm going to, uh, admit
you for further testing.

36:25.221 --> 36:28.390
You, uh, might want to
pack an overnight bag...

36:44.073 --> 36:47.743
- You're the envoy?
- I am.

36:47.868 --> 36:51.496
So all the rumors about
the crimes... must be true.

36:51.622 --> 36:55.251
Calling them "crimes" tells
me you've already lost faith.

36:55.375 --> 36:58.503
You're the arbiter of faith now?

36:58.629 --> 37:01.757
I see you've given
yourself quite a promotion.

37:01.882 --> 37:04.718
Put down the gun, Francis.

37:04.843 --> 37:08.680
And give up the only leverage
you people understand?

37:25.697 --> 37:28.575
You didn't come here...

37:28.700 --> 37:31.453
...looking for converts.

37:36.208 --> 37:38.085
Rather than spend the rest of my life

37:38.210 --> 37:41.672
trapped in a marriage
with the wrong person,

37:41.797 --> 37:43.924
I have put together a 47-step plan

37:44.049 --> 37:45.926
to renovate my wife's personality

37:46.051 --> 37:47.928
to be more compatible with my own.

37:48.095 --> 37:50.931
Now, I have divided the
steps into four phases

37:51.056 --> 37:55.227
one, two, C, and D...

37:55.352 --> 37:57.771
...which I find hilarious.

37:57.896 --> 38:00.398
I thought we could spend the
rest of the session going over it,

38:00.524 --> 38:02.276
since you're the people expert.

38:09.741 --> 38:11.535
Is that your wife?

38:13.411 --> 38:15.080
No.

38:17.208 --> 38:20.002
No.

38:26.133 --> 38:27.676
Ice.

38:37.686 --> 38:39.355
Have you done this before?

38:39.479 --> 38:41.190
I've read about it.

38:41.315 --> 38:44.609
You've read about it? We're
talking about drowning, right?

38:44.735 --> 38:46.237
Water connected me to
whatever was out there before.

38:46.362 --> 38:48.113
I need it inside me this time.

38:48.239 --> 38:50.157
It almost killed you last time.

38:50.282 --> 38:52.951
Hand me what it is that touched them.

39:12.971 --> 39:14.848
It's all about electrical impulses.

39:14.973 --> 39:17.101
The circuit between us can't be broken.

39:17.226 --> 39:18.810
You cannot let go.

39:18.936 --> 39:21.479
Whatever I do, you have to hold me under.

39:21.605 --> 39:23.815
I will be fine,

39:23.941 --> 39:26.443
even if it doesn't look that way.

39:26.568 --> 39:28.362
You promise me?

39:28.486 --> 39:30.072
Yeah.

39:32.950 --> 39:35.660
Peter?

39:35.786 --> 39:37.204
OK.

40:00.352 --> 40:02.593
- Is this supposed to happen?
- We have to hold her down!

40:04.982 --> 40:07.502
- I can't do this! She's drowning!
- She knows what she's doing!

40:08.568 --> 40:10.446
- No, I can't.
- Don't let go!

40:59.577 --> 41:04.749
It's OK! Hey, hey, hey, hey...

41:04.875 --> 41:08.128
They're looking for...

41:08.253 --> 41:10.130
...a child, one in particular.

41:10.297 --> 41:13.217
- Slaughter of the innocents?
- What?

41:13.342 --> 41:15.662
It's... it's the story of
Herod. He heard a child was born.

41:15.677 --> 41:17.595
It was a threat to his power. He murdered
a whole generation trying to find the one.

41:17.721 --> 41:19.082
How many more are they gonna kill?

41:19.181 --> 41:21.517
Photographs of babies

41:21.641 --> 41:23.727
with something on their
faces like a membrane or...

41:25.729 --> 41:27.981
- A caul.
- What?

41:28.106 --> 41:29.983
The Caul.

41:30.108 --> 41:31.943
The girl was saying it as she
was dying. I just didn't realize.

41:32.069 --> 41:34.946
- And how do you know what that is?
- Nadia was born with one.

41:37.615 --> 41:39.743
They're after the baby.

41:47.334 --> 41:50.670
Listen to me. That doctor
is worse than cancer.

41:50.795 --> 41:53.965
Oncology is last medieval form of medicine.

41:54.091 --> 41:57.386
Chopping out organs, poisoning with chemo.

41:57.511 --> 41:59.555
Radioactive for bombs, not people.

41:59.679 --> 42:01.557
If you're here to preach kale juice

42:01.681 --> 42:03.559
or wheatgrass enemas, I'm not in the mood.

42:03.683 --> 42:06.353
I have theory. Would have
published research paper,

42:06.478 --> 42:09.565
but department chairman
was discovered homosexual,

42:09.689 --> 42:11.525
which in Russia is not permitted.

42:11.691 --> 42:13.026
Get to the point.

42:13.151 --> 42:16.613
The unique structure of her protein chains,

42:16.738 --> 42:18.949
the base pairing anticodons:

42:19.074 --> 42:22.911
not a complete cure, but
assimilating her erythrocytes

42:23.036 --> 42:25.456
via digestion could
restore immune response.

42:25.581 --> 42:27.958
What are you talking about? Her, who?

42:28.083 --> 42:31.169
Plasma broth you've been drinking...

42:31.295 --> 42:34.590
you think Dr. Pryce developed
it for upir happy hour?

42:34.714 --> 42:37.675
He would never tell you this,

42:37.801 --> 42:42.973
but organic matter in that
tank are plasma discard.

42:43.098 --> 42:45.725
Pryce's 30 years,

42:45.850 --> 42:49.146
not able to create
genetically perfected human.

42:49.313 --> 42:51.523
Until now.

42:51.648 --> 42:54.067
Pryce has been feeding
me his failed experiments.

42:54.192 --> 42:56.861
Pryce serves you horse soup.

42:56.987 --> 43:00.157
Prycilla is unicorn.

43:01.992 --> 43:03.743
Eat the unicorn.

43:20.802 --> 43:23.805
Thank God.

43:37.653 --> 43:40.822
Missed the major arteries and vital organs.

43:40.947 --> 43:42.907
You could last awhile.

43:43.033 --> 43:44.868
These guys are cold.

43:44.993 --> 43:47.454
I'll help you find them.

43:47.579 --> 43:49.873
They are not my primary concern.

43:49.998 --> 43:52.543
Olivia...

43:52.668 --> 43:55.671
Your sister was getting too close to her.

43:58.089 --> 44:01.593
I only knew afterwards. Clementine
was like a daughter to me.

44:01.718 --> 44:07.599
What kind of father protects the
monster who killed his daughter?

44:07.765 --> 44:09.643
There was a pact.

44:11.687 --> 44:14.398
I was trying to stop it.

44:14.523 --> 44:17.067
The White Tower...

44:17.192 --> 44:19.277
...new technology...

44:19.403 --> 44:21.363
...will kill them all.

44:21.488 --> 44:23.865
I don't give a shit about the pact

44:23.990 --> 44:27.202
or other upirs, just the
bitch who killed my sister.

44:27.327 --> 44:30.539
Please. Take mercy on me.

44:32.123 --> 44:34.418
Please.

44:43.510 --> 44:45.387
It'll be quicker this way.

45:17.294 --> 45:19.170
How's Miranda?

45:21.005 --> 45:22.633
Not great.

45:22.758 --> 45:25.885
But... that's what tranqs are for.

45:31.308 --> 45:34.686
We gotta finish this, you and me,

45:34.810 --> 45:37.230
find the warehouse.

45:37.355 --> 45:40.191
What Destiny said,

45:40.317 --> 45:42.611
it's gotta be the one near the river bend.

45:42.736 --> 45:46.072
And when do we do this?

45:46.197 --> 45:47.823
Now.

45:47.949 --> 45:49.785
- Roman...
- Hm?

45:49.909 --> 45:54.080
- We haven't slept.
- No.

45:54.205 --> 45:57.417
They're gonna figure out where the baby is.

45:57.584 --> 46:00.962
How? They don't even know she's alive.

46:01.087 --> 46:03.006
I can't risk it.

46:03.089 --> 46:05.529
How are you gonna fight 'em?
You're gonna grab your battle-axe

46:05.592 --> 46:09.220
from above the fireplace? We need a plan.

46:09.346 --> 46:11.931
Let me think on it.

46:12.056 --> 46:13.975
Just a minute.

46:17.145 --> 46:19.105
OK.

46:19.230 --> 46:21.232
Tonight, then.

46:21.358 --> 46:23.694
We'll go check out the warehouse
and come up with a plan.

47:25.129 --> 47:27.298
When he wakes up, tell him I'll call him.

49:58.073 --> 49:59.534
Mother?

50:00.305 --> 50:06.566
