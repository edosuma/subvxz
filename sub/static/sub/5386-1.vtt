Aagh!

00:41.087 --> 00:42.212
Aagh!

00:55.421 --> 00:56.962
Help me!

01:02.338 --> 01:05.630
Can you play at peek-a-boo?

01:05.755 --> 01:08.588
I can play at peek-a-boo!

01:08.713 --> 01:11.630
<i>Can you see me? Yes, I can.</i>

01:11.755 --> 01:14.172
<i>Can you see me? Yes, I can.</i>

01:14.297 --> 01:17.880
Peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-boo!

01:18.005 --> 01:21.130
<i>Well done. That's very good. Now, ssh!</i>

01:26.338 --> 01:27.797
Still.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.588
And everyone up.

01:33.713 --> 01:36.838
And that's the end of the week.
Well done.

02:03.506 --> 02:05.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:05.839 --> 02:07.381
Sorry.

02:20.214 --> 02:24.049
Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris
for the weekend

02:24.174 --> 02:27.090
and mine is taking me
to a disused quarry!

02:27.215 --> 02:29.715
It's a flooded quarry. It's lovely.

02:29.840 --> 02:34.424
It's the last chance to see it
before the developers build over it.

02:35.382 --> 02:37.465
'Speed camera ahead. '

02:37.590 --> 02:40.299
<i>- Good on you, Kylie.
- You're such a boy!</i>

02:40.424 --> 02:44.799
<i>And I can mate it up to my mobile phone.
Pretty sexy, huh?</i>

02:44.924 --> 02:46.924
Grrr!

02:49.257 --> 02:51.840
<i>Stop it, I'm driving.</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:56.715
What's that?

02:56.840 --> 03:00.215
<i>The guy's wife had a bad back.
Kinky, huh?</i>

03:01.090 --> 03:03.174
<i>Actually, it's quite nice.</i>

03:03.299 --> 03:05.591
Do you want me to pull over?

03:10.383 --> 03:15.050
'Good afternoon.
You've been talking about fining parents

03:15.175 --> 03:18.716
'who fail to control
their children's behaviour.

03:18.841 --> 03:21.300
'When was the policy introduced? '

03:21.425 --> 03:25.383
'The Respect Agenda was a big issue
in the last election.

03:25.508 --> 03:31.300
'Tony Blair wanted to bring back a sense
of respect in schools and communities. '

03:31.425 --> 03:37.091
<i>'So increase the amount of support for
parents, including parenting contracts,</i>

03:37.216 --> 03:41.300
'to get parents to attend
parenting classes. '

03:41.425 --> 03:44.966
<i>'Lt's a case of
"It's your problem, you sort it. "</i>

03:45.091 --> 03:48.426
'It's hard to do without the school
behind you.

03:48.551 --> 03:51.301
'I have an 8-year-old struggling too. '

03:51.426 --> 03:57.176
'This is a tiny minority and children
need to be in school in order to learn.

<i>'However, the early intervention
isn't as quick to... '</i>

04:01.676 --> 04:07.176
<i>'It's hard to turn it over, being fined.
Kids are not learning anything by that.</i>

04:07.301 --> 04:11.301
'They know we're going to pay it.
They find it hilarious.

04:11.426 --> 04:14.842
'Reading about themselves
in the papers... '

04:16.009 --> 04:18.091
It's up here somewhere.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.341
<i>'At the traffic lights, turn left. '</i>

04:28.968 --> 04:30.843
Jesus!

04:45.885 --> 04:48.510
<i>Here it is. Beer, bed and breakfast.</i>

04:51.052 --> 04:52.552
Perfect.

04:57.510 --> 04:58.802
No way!

05:13.678 --> 05:16.094
Excuse me?

05:16.219 --> 05:18.303
Great bar presence!

05:21.428 --> 05:23.511
<i>Ey up, me duck?</i>

05:23.636 --> 05:25.719
<i>Two pints of lager, please.</i>

05:28.428 --> 05:31.386
<i>Give it back, give it back, give it back!</i>

05:33.094 --> 05:35.594
<i>A bit past their bedtime, isn't it?</i>

05:35.719 --> 05:38.428
<i>Yeah, poor things must be exhausted.</i>

05:39.261 --> 05:41.344
That child needs a good...

05:41.469 --> 05:43.886
I bloody told you!

05:52.845 --> 05:55.137
Another pint of Wife-Beater?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.304
Yep.

06:01.679 --> 06:04.345
- Call yourself a mother?
- You what?

06:04.470 --> 06:06.804
<i>You want beef, eh? You want beef?</i>

06:06.929 --> 06:10.595
You fucking dickhead!
You want beef?

06:12.387 --> 06:15.470
- Go and tell them to shut up.
- You tell them.

06:15.595 --> 06:18.137
What are you? A man or a mouse?

06:18.262 --> 06:21.637
<i>Look, it was all right
the last time I was here.</i>

06:21.762 --> 06:24.095
Pissed up with your dive buddies?

06:24.220 --> 06:27.679
<i>I promise you,
the quarry's fucking stunning.</i>

06:28.637 --> 06:31.055
The quarry's stunning.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.263
No "fucking".

06:37.096 --> 06:39.138
<i>Please, Miss?</i>

06:59.388 --> 07:02.596
<i>'At your first opportunity, turn left. '</i>

07:09.221 --> 07:12.556
<i>Eden Lake, my arse! Slapton Quarry!</i>

07:12.681 --> 07:16.389
"Gated community"?
Who are they so afraid of?

07:16.514 --> 07:18.597
Everyone.

07:43.222 --> 07:48.556
This is getting more and more romantic.
You've brought me to a building site!

07:48.681 --> 07:50.764
<i>Look, will you just trust me?</i>

07:56.098 --> 07:59.140
This used to be a public park.
Look at this.

08:11.182 --> 08:13.265
Here we go.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.599
<i>'At your first opportunity, turn around. '</i>

09:11.391 --> 09:13.475
<i>Oh, ye of little faith!</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:21.225
What do you think?

09:21.350 --> 09:23.434
It's beautiful.

09:25.392 --> 09:27.434
I can see it.

09:50.059 --> 09:52.225
- Hello.
- Hey!

09:52.350 --> 09:56.518
- Have you cycled all the way here?
- And no Kylie!

09:59.643 --> 10:02.976
What have you got there? A caterpillar?

10:03.101 --> 10:06.310
My mum says
I shouldn't talk to strangers.

10:07.351 --> 10:10.685
Your mum's quite right.
We'll leave you to it.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.893
Come on.

10:26.601 --> 10:30.518
<i>Yes, you see,
it is missing 50 executive homes.</i>

10:36.769 --> 10:38.852
I love it.

10:53.852 --> 10:56.311
Is that new?

10:56.436 --> 10:58.727
Yeah. Do you like it?

10:59.561 --> 11:03.644
<i>I like the bottom.
I'm not so sure about the top, though.</i>

11:18.145 --> 11:19.895
Oi!

11:21.062 --> 11:24.603
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Clear off!

11:24.728 --> 11:28.812
- What the fuck's all this shit?
- Fucking little prick.

11:29.687 --> 11:32.145
<i>Hey, that's the little boy we saw.</i>

11:32.270 --> 11:35.145
Since when did you support England?

11:35.270 --> 11:37.395
Little hoods.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.603
<i>Here, Mark, watch this.</i>

11:40.978 --> 11:42.978
<i>Oh, Steve...</i>

11:43.812 --> 11:45.895
It's just boys being boys.

11:47.645 --> 11:50.478
As long as they leave us alone.

11:50.603 --> 11:52.978
<i>Run for it, run!</i>

11:53.103 --> 11:56.103
<i>- Get the fuck out of here!
- Go on, have him.</i>

12:18.146 --> 12:19.938
Jesus!

12:21.146 --> 12:22.896
<i>Bonnie, come!</i>

12:23.021 --> 12:25.396
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:25.521 --> 12:28.146
<i>Good girl, good girl, good girl.</i>

12:32.104 --> 12:34.979
Come on then.

12:35.104 --> 12:36.646
Lovely.

12:39.314 --> 12:42.939
Fancy a dip before it craps in the water?

12:43.064 --> 12:46.480
<i>No, you go. I'll keep an eye on the stuff.</i>

12:46.605 --> 12:48.647
Probably not a bad idea.

12:48.772 --> 12:50.647
Good girl.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.648
<i>Oh, man!</i>

13:22.731 --> 13:24.815
<i>Come on, Bonnie! Bonnie!</i>

13:24.940 --> 13:29.065
<i>Bonnie, come here, girl!
Come here! Come here!</i>

13:29.190 --> 13:31.273
<i>Good girl, Bonnie.</i>

13:39.065 --> 13:40.606
Ow!

13:48.815 --> 13:52.731
<i>Hey, guys. Can you do us a favour
and turn the music down?</i>

13:52.856 --> 13:56.106
<i>- Can't hear you, mate.
- Turn your sounds down.</i>

13:56.231 --> 13:59.065
<i>Can't hear you, mate.</i>

14:03.649 --> 14:07.024
- What are you doing?
- And watch your dog.

14:07.149 --> 14:09.649
- He's scaring my girlfriend.
- She.

14:09.774 --> 14:12.857
- Hmm?
- Bitch. She's a bitch.

14:14.024 --> 14:18.441
Don't be dicks. This is a big beach.
There's room for all of us.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.649
Who are you calling a dick?

14:20.774 --> 14:23.399
And what are you looking at? My tits?

14:24.899 --> 14:27.191
Fucking jog on! Prick.

14:29.566 --> 14:31.149
Dickhead.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.817
<i>Hey, what a prick!</i>

14:41.942 --> 14:43.733
Mug!

14:58.108 --> 14:59.942
Oh!

15:00.067 --> 15:02.650
Why don't we just find another spot?

15:02.775 --> 15:06.025
I won't be bullied by a bunch
of 12-year-olds.

15:06.150 --> 15:09.817
- And let it ruin our afternoon?
- We were here first.

15:13.817 --> 15:15.900
<i>Well, this is relaxing</i>

15:19.150 --> 15:21.568
- What are you doing?
- Fuck off!

15:21.693 --> 15:23.776
Why? Why?

15:28.568 --> 15:31.151
<i>Oh, mate, I love bird-watching.</i>

15:32.151 --> 15:35.568
<i>- What's with you, you tit?
- You're the tit!</i>

15:39.859 --> 15:41.943
What are you looking at her for?

15:42.068 --> 15:44.901
<i>I'm not looking at her face,
just her tits.</i>

15:45.026 --> 15:47.609
She's an ugly bint.

16:12.860 --> 16:15.277
Booya-booya-booya!

16:22.235 --> 16:24.777
<i>Yeah, do you want my autograph?</i>

16:32.235 --> 16:34.819
Happy now? Hmm?

16:34.944 --> 16:36.527
Hmm.

16:45.736 --> 16:47.820
<i>Hey, Jenny!</i>

16:53.278 --> 16:55.486
Nearly!

17:32.446 --> 17:34.529
Fancy another brewski?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.737
<i>Yeah, why not?</i>

17:41.279 --> 17:43.362
<i>Steve, what's that?</i>

17:46.279 --> 17:48.362
It's nothing.

17:54.696 --> 17:57.279
There's not much to do after dark.

17:57.404 --> 17:58.862
Nope.

18:00.112 --> 18:04.029
Wanna check out
our exclusive New England home?

18:04.862 --> 18:06.738
- Hmm?
- Sure.

18:07.738 --> 18:11.030
- Do you like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

18:24.613 --> 18:26.947
- Stephen Taylor...
- Hmm?

18:30.988 --> 18:33.072
What's that noise?

18:35.780 --> 18:37.863
It's just the wind.

18:40.822 --> 18:42.905
<i>No, that's not the wind.</i>

18:45.905 --> 18:47.989
Could be a fox.

18:49.073 --> 18:51.156
Or a donkey.

18:53.323 --> 18:55.406
<i>No, listen. Ssh!</i>

18:56.573 --> 18:58.739
You're just imagining it.

19:03.614 --> 19:07.281
<i>- I'll go take a look.
- No, don't go... Go.</i>

19:26.323 --> 19:27.990
Steve?

19:30.157 --> 19:32.240
Hello?

19:32.365 --> 19:34.449
Steve?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.657
Hello?

19:43.657 --> 19:45.449
Steve!

19:51.282 --> 19:53.365
Ugh!

19:54.365 --> 19:56.282
Steve?

20:01.865 --> 20:04.365
<i>Steve, stop messing around!</i>

20:17.491 --> 20:19.575
- Steve!
- Ooh ah ha ha ha!

20:20.825 --> 20:23.866
- That was horrible.
- I'm sorry.

20:23.991 --> 20:26.158
- Get off!
- I'm really sorry.

20:26.283 --> 20:29.491
- Ow! You're freezing!
- Then warm me up.

20:30.325 --> 20:33.366
<i>You're a big, crude, pikey oaf!</i>

20:33.491 --> 20:35.866
I love you. Love you.

21:04.867 --> 21:06.784
Eugh!

21:12.117 --> 21:14.201
I am absolutely starving.

21:14.326 --> 21:17.451
- I could eat a horse.
- So move to France.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.909
Fuck!

21:23.117 --> 21:24.659
Shit!

21:24.784 --> 21:27.784
- What's happened?
- Little fuckers!

21:48.702 --> 21:52.243
<i>- How's your tyre, mate?
- Fucking git!</i>

21:52.368 --> 21:54.452
Little fuckers!

21:55.743 --> 21:58.160
<i>No, wait, Steve!</i>

22:01.077 --> 22:03.368
- Watch it!
- Shit!

22:03.493 --> 22:07.660
<i>You should've got a smaller body,
fucking dollar boy!</i>

22:07.785 --> 22:10.827
- Breakfast?
- Fuck!

22:14.453 --> 22:16.536
<i>Right, what would you like?</i>

22:16.661 --> 22:19.911
The full English
with white toast and coffee.

22:20.036 --> 22:22.911
- And for you?
- I'll get the same.

22:23.036 --> 22:27.869
<i>Hey, you wouldn't have seen a bunch
of kids tooling around on BMXs?</i>

22:27.994 --> 22:31.119
Certainly have. Been terrorising you?

22:31.244 --> 22:35.036
<i>- Well, hassling us.
- Little terrors.</i>

22:36.828 --> 22:40.036
<i>I wouldn't worry too much,
a big boy like you.</i>

22:40.161 --> 22:44.828
They punctured my back tyre.
I thought parents might want to know.

22:44.953 --> 22:47.828
Not my kids.

22:47.953 --> 22:52.287
<i>- No, I didn't mean they were your kids.
- Not mine.</i>

22:54.370 --> 22:56.579
Never mind.

22:56.704 --> 22:58.787
I don't want any trouble.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.704
Making friends?

23:06.120 --> 23:08.745
I think she likes me.

23:18.579 --> 23:20.662
What the?

23:21.704 --> 23:23.787
<i>No, Steve, it's not worth it.</i>

23:23.912 --> 23:28.620
<i>If everyone said that, where would we be?
I'll be back in a minute.</i>

23:52.288 --> 23:53.830
Hello?

23:59.080 --> 24:01.163
Anyone home?

24:03.288 --> 24:04.663
Hello?

24:26.081 --> 24:29.039
<i>- Come on, you're blocking my drive!
- OK.</i>

24:29.164 --> 24:31.247
- Come on!
- All right!

24:32.414 --> 24:33.456
Sorry!

24:33.581 --> 24:35.664
Stupid bitch!

25:15.623 --> 25:16.665
Shit!

25:20.123 --> 25:23.623
Brett! Is that you?
Get down here now!

25:23.748 --> 25:25.957
<i>Can't run away, little bunny.</i>

25:26.082 --> 25:30.290
<i>Yeah, that's right,
you can't because you're in a box.</i>

25:30.415 --> 25:33.915
<i>Brett!
Brett, don't make me come up there!</i>

25:37.208 --> 25:38.791
Shit!

25:41.041 --> 25:42.833
Brett!

25:54.249 --> 25:57.291
The hutch should be destroyed. Burn it.

25:57.416 --> 25:59.166
Brett!

25:59.291 --> 26:01.374
Let's go!

26:05.416 --> 26:07.999
I can feel that schoolteacher look.

26:08.124 --> 26:12.166
<i>Yeah, you're lucky.
You could have broken something.</i>

26:12.291 --> 26:16.458
<i>- Let's just enjoy the weekend.
- Yeah, I'd like that.</i>

26:31.125 --> 26:32.542
Yes?

26:34.125 --> 26:38.209
<i>- You were going to say something?
- No, not a word.</i>

26:38.334 --> 26:40.667
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

26:40.792 --> 26:44.875
<i>- I thought you were looking at my foot.
- No, wait. No, no!</i>

26:45.000 --> 26:47.292
<i>- You're going in!
- Steve, no!</i>

26:50.250 --> 26:51.834
No!

26:54.750 --> 26:57.876
<i>- Oh, it's fucking freezing.
- Language!</i>

27:26.335 --> 27:28.418
<i>All right, lazy bones?</i>

27:40.502 --> 27:44.544
It's amazing the stuff you find
at the bottom of the lake.

27:45.502 --> 27:47.752
<i>Steve, where's the beach bag?</i>

27:48.836 --> 27:50.919
It was right here.

27:54.002 --> 27:57.419
I don't believe it.
It's got the car keys in it.

28:01.336 --> 28:03.794
<i>Please, God, don't tell me...</i>

28:04.627 --> 28:06.419
Fuck!

28:08.711 --> 28:11.169
Fuck! Fuck!

28:56.587 --> 28:58.045
Tossers!

29:09.504 --> 29:11.588
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

29:45.297 --> 29:47.380
<i>Jenny, come on.</i>

30:08.672 --> 30:11.880
- Come on.
- No... Let's just leave it.

30:12.005 --> 30:14.089
They've got our car.

30:17.047 --> 30:19.672
<i>Go on, go on. Go on!</i>

30:19.797 --> 30:22.464
Fucking shitting itself! Fuck off!

30:27.673 --> 30:28.923
Brett!

30:37.715 --> 30:41.090
Listen... I don't care
what you're up to here.

30:41.215 --> 30:44.715
<i>- I just want my car back.
- It's not us, mate.</i>

30:50.131 --> 30:52.215
<i>Car keys, phone, wallet.</i>

30:52.340 --> 30:55.798
<i>- Not us, mate.
- Steve, come on. Let's leave it.</i>

30:56.631 --> 31:00.131
<i>- You're wearing my shades.
- They're mine, mate.</i>

31:00.256 --> 31:02.715
Your Ray-Ban Aviators?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.924
<i>Fakes, mate.</i>

31:07.216 --> 31:09.716
<i>Yeah, Steve, come on.</i>

31:11.841 --> 31:14.299
Listen... You've had your fun.

31:15.466 --> 31:19.091
Let's just call it quits.
Tell me where the car is.

31:20.424 --> 31:22.549
Keep that animal back.

31:22.674 --> 31:26.049
<i>- Where's my fucking car?
- I've got no idea, mate.</i>

31:26.174 --> 31:28.716
- Watch that fucking dog!
- Watch yours!

31:28.841 --> 31:31.132
What did you say?

31:33.299 --> 31:35.882
That's my phone.

31:36.007 --> 31:39.132
- Steve...
- Got the same ringtone as me?

31:40.799 --> 31:43.007
Steve!

31:44.883 --> 31:47.592
Hit him! He's got a fucking knife!

32:00.633 --> 32:01.675
Bonnie...

32:04.467 --> 32:06.967
Bonnie! Bonnie!

32:13.092 --> 32:15.175
You stuck my dog.

32:15.300 --> 32:19.758
It was an accident. Give me the car keys.
I'll drive her to the vet.

32:19.883 --> 32:22.508
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

32:23.967 --> 32:25.843
Fuck off!

32:39.384 --> 32:41.676
She's... She's fucking dying.

32:43.343 --> 32:45.676
I'm sorry.

32:45.801 --> 32:48.426
- She's fucking dying!
- Brett...

32:48.551 --> 32:51.009
- Brett...
- Fuck off!

32:52.384 --> 32:55.926
<i>Bonnie, don't die on me. Not you. Bonnie!</i>

32:56.051 --> 32:57.384
Steve...

32:57.509 --> 33:00.134
I've got the car keys. Let's just go.

33:00.259 --> 33:03.093
<i>- Come on!
- Don't die on me, Bonnie!</i>

33:03.218 --> 33:05.843
<i>Come on, Steve!</i>

33:14.177 --> 33:15.844
Bonnie!

33:22.344 --> 33:24.802
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

33:26.177 --> 33:28.052
Get 'em!

33:31.385 --> 33:32.719
Fuck!

33:34.260 --> 33:36.385
<i>Steve, quick!</i>

33:50.345 --> 33:51.553
Right!

33:53.220 --> 33:54.470
Shit!

33:56.261 --> 33:57.803
Go back!

34:02.803 --> 34:03.845
Shit!

34:11.386 --> 34:13.553
- Get on to it!
- Jesus Christ!

34:13.678 --> 34:15.719
Come on!

34:15.844 --> 34:17.969
<i>Quick, go back!</i>

34:18.094 --> 34:20.094
Get out the fucking car!

34:21.344 --> 34:23.594
<i>- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Fuck!</i>

34:23.719 --> 34:25.803
Get out the fucking car!

34:25.928 --> 34:28.346
Get out the fucking car!

34:30.554 --> 34:32.221
Fucking prick!

34:32.346 --> 34:34.387
<i>Oh, my God! Shit!</i>

34:36.679 --> 34:39.679
- You fucking bitch!
- Steve!

34:42.262 --> 34:44.554
<i>I can't see, I can't fucking see.</i>

34:44.679 --> 34:48.262
I can't see where we're fucking going!
Jesus Christ!

34:53.179 --> 34:54.471
Shit!

34:58.471 --> 35:00.804
Aargh! Oh!

35:00.929 --> 35:03.804
Are you all right? Wait.

35:05.179 --> 35:06.387
Ohhh!

35:06.512 --> 35:09.722
- I can't get...
- I'm stuck! I'm fucking stuck!

35:09.847 --> 35:11.513
- Wait.
- Jesus!

35:11.638 --> 35:15.013
- I can't get it.
- OK... Listen to me.

35:15.138 --> 35:18.222
<i>- Oh, my God, they're coming!
- Listen to me!</i>

35:18.347 --> 35:21.347
Listen. Go. Find a road. Take this.

35:21.472 --> 35:24.263
- No...
- Go get help! Go!

35:38.888 --> 35:41.472
Fucking kill 'em!

35:41.597 --> 35:44.013
<i>This way, this way, come on!</i>

35:51.431 --> 35:54.098
<i>Brett, it's over here!</i>

35:54.223 --> 35:55.598
Fuck!

35:55.723 --> 35:58.306
Come over here. I've got the car!

36:04.264 --> 36:05.806
Ugh!

38:04.642 --> 38:06.809
<i>Brett, this is fucked up!</i>

38:07.851 --> 38:13.059
It's ten fucking miles into town
in the dark. She's not fucking Lassie!

38:15.934 --> 38:18.017
Are you watching the road?

38:18.142 --> 38:20.601
No one goes home. You get here now!

38:20.726 --> 38:25.434
<i>Please, let me go. I won't say anything.
Please, let me go.</i>

38:26.642 --> 38:30.309
<i>Listen, Brett,
people know that we're here.</i>

38:30.434 --> 38:33.059
They're going to call the police.

38:33.184 --> 38:38.143
<i>If you let me go, I swear on my life,
I won't tell anyone.</i>

38:38.268 --> 38:43.018
<i>Look, guys, please. We can stop this.
Nobody's died yet.</i>

38:43.143 --> 38:45.227
My fucking dog died though!

38:45.352 --> 38:47.560
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

38:47.685 --> 38:52.310
There's going to be another accident
when I find that bitch of yours!

38:54.268 --> 38:57.685
"No one's died. "
Wait and see what happens to her

38:57.810 --> 39:00.310
when I fucking see her!

39:00.435 --> 39:04.102
Get the fuck off me! Fucking little prick!

39:04.227 --> 39:06.685
<i>Let's not be head-loose, right?</i>

39:06.810 --> 39:10.685
- Who are you calling head-loose?
- Let's not be rash.

39:12.060 --> 39:16.436
<i>First phone he sees, 999-
who's fucking head-loose?</i>

39:18.686 --> 39:22.144
<i>No, this is rash shit, man.
I never touched him.</i>

39:26.144 --> 39:29.144
<i>- What, you didn't touch him?
- No, mate.</i>

39:31.936 --> 39:34.186
You fucking touch him now then!

39:39.853 --> 39:41.811
Him or me.

39:45.603 --> 39:49.769
<i>You wanna front, you wanna act
like the fucking big man?</i>

39:49.894 --> 39:52.103
You'll step up now.

40:01.645 --> 40:03.729
All right.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.687
Jesus...

40:07.812 --> 40:10.395
<i>Paige, get this!</i>

40:13.479 --> 40:16.312
<i>- Don't fucking record it, man.
- Huh?</i>

40:18.270 --> 40:20.687
<i>No, wait.</i>

40:20.812 --> 40:22.895
Fucking wait!

40:30.562 --> 40:33.770
- Go on then.
- Fuck you!

40:42.813 --> 40:46.230
No. That's not even a proper cut. Deeper.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.730
Deeper!

40:49.855 --> 40:52.313
Aaaargh!

40:52.438 --> 40:54.730
Aaagh! Fuck!

41:01.688 --> 41:05.521
<i>All right, now everyone'll have a dig.
Marky Mark?</i>

41:16.938 --> 41:18.397
Jesus!

41:18.522 --> 41:21.731
<i>- Oh, man, I can't fucking see this!
- Jesus!</i>

41:22.856 --> 41:25.064
Ugh!

41:25.189 --> 41:27.189
<i>- Fuck's sake.
- Go on, Mark.</i>

41:28.314 --> 41:32.022
<i>- Aaaagh!
- Jesus Christ, fucking bollocks.</i>

41:37.939 --> 41:40.064
Ricky Dicky...

41:57.231 --> 41:58.773
Go on.

42:02.982 --> 42:05.023
Shit! My shoe!

42:06.190 --> 42:09.482
<i>These are fucking Gold Tops, man.
Brand-new.</i>

42:09.607 --> 42:11.857
You little fuckwit.

42:11.982 --> 42:14.857
<i>Cooper! Bang on, mate, you're up!</i>

42:14.982 --> 42:16.107
What?

42:16.232 --> 42:18.315
<i>Come on, mate.</i>

42:20.690 --> 42:21.732
Knife.

42:21.857 --> 42:23.940
<i>Paige, keep that phone up.</i>

42:28.190 --> 42:30.648
<i>Right, Coops, everyone has a dig.</i>

42:36.315 --> 42:39.607
<i>Go on then, Cooper.
Let's see your bottle.</i>

42:54.774 --> 42:56.899
<i>Come on, come on. Please.</i>

43:05.066 --> 43:07.149
<i>Brett, I can't.</i>

43:07.274 --> 43:11.566
<i>For fuck's sake, listen!
We're all in this together. Go on.</i>

43:11.691 --> 43:14.024
- He's scared.
- I'm not scared.

43:14.149 --> 43:19.233
Listen. He's heard all of our fucking
names. Either do it or he's gonna spill.

43:19.358 --> 43:21.400
Go on...

43:28.859 --> 43:31.359
Do it! Cut his fucking tongue out!

43:32.775 --> 43:37.025
- Fucking hell! That's bloody.
- That's lethal.

43:42.067 --> 43:45.817
- Here you are.
- I can't believe you did that.

43:45.942 --> 43:48.442
Look - it's Tony Montana!

43:53.567 --> 43:56.775
All right. Now we've got to finish this.

44:08.526 --> 44:11.026
<i>Please, please...</i>

44:12.276 --> 44:14.568
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

44:17.901 --> 44:21.193
Please...

44:22.651 --> 44:25.818
What's up?

44:28.818 --> 44:32.193
Bluetooth. She's fucking here.

44:32.318 --> 44:35.110
<i>Jenny, run! Run!</i>

44:35.235 --> 44:37.526
Come on! Run!

44:47.736 --> 44:49.236
Aargh!

45:13.111 --> 45:15.652
There's the bitch!

45:32.237 --> 45:33.862
Bitch!

45:37.570 --> 45:40.445
<i>Well, fuck the bikes. Come on!</i>

45:44.862 --> 45:46.320
Ahh!

46:16.988 --> 46:19.029
Fuck!

46:27.446 --> 46:30.654
Get to the clearing. Guard the fucker.

46:53.697 --> 46:55.780
Right.

46:59.322 --> 47:01.447
Where is she?

47:15.239 --> 47:16.905
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

47:20.655 --> 47:22.989
<i>- Brett, he's gone!
- What?</i>

47:23.114 --> 47:28.323
<i>- He's not here!
- Mate, he's cut to fuck. Follow the blood.</i>

47:29.031 --> 47:30.823
Come on!

47:48.865 --> 47:51.573
Fuck's sake!

47:54.906 --> 47:56.865
Oi! Oi!

48:46.366 --> 48:48.658
- Steve!
- Jenny...

48:48.783 --> 48:51.492
Come on! We've got to get out of here!

48:51.617 --> 48:53.783
Come on...

48:58.242 --> 49:00.283
Come on.

49:14.867 --> 49:16.908
Come on.

49:19.658 --> 49:21.742
This way.

49:32.576 --> 49:34.368
Aargh!

49:34.493 --> 49:36.784
Gently! All right?

49:37.951 --> 49:40.534
- I'm all right.
- That's it.

49:45.493 --> 49:51.118
<i>OK. We're going to clean you up,
all right? We're going to clean you up.</i>

49:54.243 --> 49:56.326
Drink some water.

49:57.993 --> 49:59.618
I'm...

50:00.659 --> 50:02.951
Well done. All right.

50:03.993 --> 50:05.034
Em...

50:16.535 --> 50:19.410
<i>OK, this is going to sting.</i>

50:19.535 --> 50:20.577
OK...

50:20.702 --> 50:24.035
Well done. I know it does sting.

50:31.744 --> 50:35.869
<i>- Oh, shit!
- How does it look?</i>

50:36.910 --> 50:41.285
- It looks worse than it is.
- Let me see.

50:44.077 --> 50:48.244
<i>Oh, Jesus! God!
That's black blood. Gut blood.</i>

50:48.369 --> 50:52.536
- I'm fucking bleeding to death!
- You're not going to die!

50:52.661 --> 50:55.453
I'm not going to let you die! I'm not!

50:55.578 --> 51:00.370
They haven't hit any arteries.
Right. You've just got to stay calm.

51:00.495 --> 51:06.203
<i>Stay calm. You can't go into shock. Deep
breaths, measured breaths. Stay still.</i>

51:06.328 --> 51:11.536
<i>You're going to be all right. You'll be
all right, you'll be OK. I promise.</i>

51:13.411 --> 51:15.495
I'm so sorry.

51:15.620 --> 51:18.370
I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.

51:26.536 --> 51:29.245
I thought Africa for a honeymoon.

51:31.745 --> 51:34.246
<i>Beach first, for a rest,</i>

51:34.371 --> 51:36.454
and then safari.

51:37.787 --> 51:41.954
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm with you.

51:42.079 --> 51:44.579
Africa sounds lovely.

51:50.912 --> 51:53.496
I even asked your old man.

52:01.454 --> 52:03.496
Shit!

52:07.537 --> 52:09.496
Other side.

52:10.662 --> 52:12.704
Ah... shit.

52:26.288 --> 52:28.413
That's him. He's been here.

52:38.455 --> 52:41.580
Find him and drain him
like a fucking bottle.

52:41.705 --> 52:46.038
<i>- I'm tired, Brett.
- Shut up, shite bag. Is that you?</i>

52:46.163 --> 52:49.080
<i>Is that you, fat lad?</i>

52:52.330 --> 52:56.998
<i>- No, not mine, mate.
- That's a girl's footprint.</i>

52:57.123 --> 53:00.206
<i>Well, she's with him, then.</i>

53:13.873 --> 53:19.081
That fucker can't be far.
He's nearly half fucking dead. Split up.

53:19.206 --> 53:23.706
<i>Spread out between here and the fence.
All right, come on.</i>

53:29.914 --> 53:32.414
You fat fuck!

53:35.290 --> 53:40.207
<i>Get going.
Work off some of that weight, you fat shit.</i>

54:03.415 --> 54:05.374
Sorry...

54:24.166 --> 54:26.875
Well done. Let's get your head down.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.125
<i>That's it, that's it. Well done.
Well done.</i>

54:34.458 --> 54:36.250
Steve?

54:37.375 --> 54:40.375
<i>Steve! Steve, please...</i>

54:43.208 --> 54:46.208
I've got to get us out of here. OK?

54:46.333 --> 54:51.291
- I can't move.
- Then I've got to go. OK?

54:51.416 --> 54:53.416
I'm safe here.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.541
They've gone.

54:57.001 --> 55:01.167
<i>You need blood, Steve,
or you're going to die.</i>

55:02.792 --> 55:05.292
I need to get to town.

55:11.667 --> 55:14.376
I saw power pylons on the way in.

55:16.209 --> 55:18.709
They must lead somewhere.

55:33.917 --> 55:35.792
Look.

55:35.917 --> 55:37.792
Look!

55:43.210 --> 55:47.668
Now you stay hidden...
and you hold on.

55:47.793 --> 55:49.752
You come back.

56:48.419 --> 56:53.628
<i>- Brett, I'm really tired.
- Take a toke on this, you little shit!</i>

57:00.920 --> 57:02.962
Come on!

57:15.170 --> 57:18.004
Aaaaaiee! God!

57:19.045 --> 57:20.920
God!

57:21.045 --> 57:23.879
Aaaah! Aaaaah!

57:24.004 --> 57:26.920
<i>Oi, oi, oi! This way, yeah?</i>

57:42.130 --> 57:45.338
Come on!

58:11.671 --> 58:13.338
Unnnngh!

58:14.380 --> 58:15.796
Aaah!

58:41.256 --> 58:42.631
Arrgh!

58:53.047 --> 58:55.006
Aaaah!

59:26.882 --> 59:28.840
Unnngh!

01:00:15.341 --> 01:00:17.424
It's OK! It's...

01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:22.216
It's me. It's... It's Jenny.
Remember me from the lake?

01:00:25.384 --> 01:00:28.717
I just... I need some help.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:34.967
I want to talk to your mum.
Can you take me to her?

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:40.300
She's working.

01:00:40.425 --> 01:00:42.384
But I'm...

01:00:46.967 --> 01:00:49.675
I really need to get into town.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.800
Can you please just show me the way?

01:01:14.051 --> 01:01:18.843
<i>- Shouldn't we follow the power lines?
- No, this way's quicker.</i>

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:23.260
My mum picks me up down here.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.926
What? Here?
In her car with your bike?

01:01:30.676 --> 01:01:32.635
What?

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:48.802
<i>- Have you got a signal here?
- No, just games.</i>

01:01:48.927 --> 01:01:51.636
She should be here soon.

01:01:53.427 --> 01:01:57.177
- I thought she was working.
- She's finished her shift.

01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:02.677
- No signal?
- One bar.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:06.469
<i>- Adam, I need your phone.
- We shouldn't be here!</i>

01:02:06.594 --> 01:02:09.302
- Please!
- Its battery's low!

01:02:09.427 --> 01:02:12.511
My mum might need to call me back!

01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:18.969
<i>Adam, your mum is coming to get you,
isn't she? Hmm?</i>

01:02:19.094 --> 01:02:21.261
<i>Adam, what's going on?</i>

01:02:21.386 --> 01:02:25.469
<i>Where have you brought me?
Please, Adam!</i>

01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:28.512
Please... just give me the bloody phone!

01:02:28.637 --> 01:02:31.512
How now brown cow!

01:02:57.178 --> 01:03:01.345
<i>She's awake!
Brett, she's fucking awake!</i>

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:06.470
<i>Mark, you fucking pussy!
You didn't hit her hard enough!</i>

01:03:08.429 --> 01:03:10.388
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

01:03:18.471 --> 01:03:20.971
We found him.

01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:27.221
<i>- Brett, we can't do this! She's alive!
- And he's dead.</i>

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:32.388
We did him.

01:03:33.846 --> 01:03:36.763
Paige has got you all having a dig.

01:03:36.888 --> 01:03:42.263
<i>It's on her phone. No ballsing out now,
lads. No backing down.</i>

01:03:45.513 --> 01:03:48.763
<i>Oh, Jesus...</i>

01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:55.889
<i>- Paige, get filming. Come here.
- Oh, fuck it!</i>

01:03:58.847 --> 01:04:02.055
<i>Look at me, man. Wanna be in our gang?</i>

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.680
<i>Prove yourself, then.</i>

01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:10.639
<i>No, please...!
Adam, no, please... don't do it!</i>

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.680
<i>Please, don't do it! Please...!</i>

01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:17.305
Go on. Go on.

01:04:19.847 --> 01:04:22.847
<i>- What?
- Listen, you've seen too much.</i>

01:04:22.972 --> 01:04:26.680
<i>You either do it now, yeah, or you're next.</i>

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.306
<i>Go on, then.</i>

01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:36.806
Go on!

01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:47.556
No! No-o-o!

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.181
Stop!

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:56.640
That fucking stinks.

01:04:56.765 --> 01:05:01.973
<i>Fucking look at that! That was you.
That was fucking you, not me.</i>

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:04.806
- Fucking you.
- Please...!

01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:08.015
Fucking bitch. Ask her if it's warm.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.015
Is it warm? Say it! Is it warm?

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:15.557
Fucking you do it an' all! Ask her!

01:05:15.682 --> 01:05:19.599
- Is it warm? Is it warm?
- Say it! Louder!

01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:22.016
Is it warm?

01:05:22.141 --> 01:05:25.849
<i>Fucking burn!
Burn, you little bitch! Go on!</i>

01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:31.391
<i>Yeah! Fucking hell! Fucking smile, boy.
You fucking love it.</i>

01:05:39.891 --> 01:05:42.307
<i>Oi, oi!</i>

01:05:47.307 --> 01:05:49.724
<i>Go on, then.</i>

01:05:55.558 --> 01:05:58.058
<i>Come here, you fucking shit!</i>

01:05:58.183 --> 01:06:02.058
You get the fuck back here
or I'll burn him!

01:06:02.183 --> 01:06:05.392
Come on! Come on!

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:09.808
Right! Do him!

01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:13.642
<i>Help! Jenny, help!</i>

01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:15.850
Help! Help!

01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:17.850
Help!

01:06:24.225 --> 01:06:26.100
Aaargh!

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.310
<i>- OK...
- Brett, this way!</i>

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:58.145
She's got the fucking map!
She knows which way to go.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:03.479
<i>No, we know which way she's fucking
going. There's one track into town.</i>

01:09:03.604 --> 01:09:06.687
- She won't go far on her foot.
- Look.

01:09:06.812 --> 01:09:10.604
What? What does it say?

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:15.270
<i>"Jenny Greengrass and Steve Taylor
attacked. Mark, Brett, Ricky, Cooper. "</i>

01:09:15.395 --> 01:09:18.104
<i>Shit, we're famous, mate!</i>

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:20.938
<i>- You got a match?
- No, mate.</i>

01:09:22.688 --> 01:09:24.772
<i>Fuck it, then.</i>

01:09:26.522 --> 01:09:32.188
<i>When I find that fucking bitch,
I'm going to fucking bury her, mate.</i>

01:09:35.063 --> 01:09:37.147
Fucking hell!

01:09:42.397 --> 01:09:45.313
<i>Little prick, come on.</i>

01:11:19.065 --> 01:11:21.025
Miss...

01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:30.816
Uurgh!

01:12:05.734 --> 01:12:08.442
I can't stand it...!

01:12:22.401 --> 01:12:24.359
No...!

01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:30.484
<i>No, no, no!</i>

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:56.652
<i>- We're not going to find her in the dark!
- Yes, we fucking are! Go on!</i>

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:06.860
Aaaargh!

01:13:07.902 --> 01:13:09.860
Brett!

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.860
- Paige?
- Brett!

01:13:21.777 --> 01:13:24.903
- Brett!
- Paige!

01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:52.319
Look at what you've fucking done!
Fuck!

01:13:52.444 --> 01:13:56.611
<i>You know what, Brett?
Fuck this - I'm gone, mate.</i>

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:57.986
What?

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.569
<i>No. No, no, no. Paige, phone.</i>

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.029
<i>Look! Look, look, look.
Look, look, it's you. That's you.</i>

01:14:16.154 --> 01:14:21.779
I didn't want this. I didn't want
to kill him or fucking burn that lad!

01:14:21.904 --> 01:14:25.029
- And I don't want to go to pen.
- Pen?

01:14:25.154 --> 01:14:27.862
What do you know about pen?

01:14:28.904 --> 01:14:33.487
Have you been inside?
Has your old man been inside?

01:14:33.612 --> 01:14:38.320
<i>What the fuck are you crying for,
you fucking girl?</i>

01:14:41.404 --> 01:14:43.695
Who you calling?

01:14:46.905 --> 01:14:50.113
Who you calling?

01:14:50.238 --> 01:14:53.821
Put that down. Put that...

01:14:53.946 --> 01:14:57.571
Put that down. Put it down. Put it down.

01:14:57.696 --> 01:14:59.738
Put it down.

01:15:03.613 --> 01:15:07.321
- Brett!
- I'll fucking batter you!

01:15:07.446 --> 01:15:10.405
I'll fucking batter you!

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.446
Brett...!

01:15:12.571 --> 01:15:17.655
I... told... you... to... put... that... down!

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.321
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

01:15:24.238 --> 01:15:29.156
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

01:15:29.281 --> 01:15:33.031
<i>Turn it off! Turn it off,
you fucking bitch!</i>

01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:55.114
Oh...

01:16:26.532 --> 01:16:30.823
- God! Are you OK?
- You've got to help me!

01:16:30.948 --> 01:16:35.490
<i>- Please, just get me out of here.
- Fuck! What's going on?</i>

01:16:35.615 --> 01:16:40.532
- They killed my boyfriend!
- All right! All right! Get in the car!

01:16:47.658 --> 01:16:51.616
- What happened back there?
- I'm being hunted.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:55.908
- Hunted? By who?
- A gang. Just get me into town.

01:16:56.033 --> 01:17:00.408
- Town's the other way.
- Why the other way?

01:17:01.533 --> 01:17:04.199
Me fucking brother's out here!

01:17:04.324 --> 01:17:09.116
- Your brother?
- My little brother. Now I'm worried.

01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:12.074
<i>- Oh, no...
- Ricky?</i>

01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:15.241
<i>Ricky, are you OK? You ready?</i>

01:17:15.366 --> 01:17:20.158
<i>- I'll be there in two ticks. Yeah?
- No, please, stop! Turn around!</i>

01:17:20.283 --> 01:17:23.699
<i>- Please, go the other way!
- I will.</i>

01:17:36.825 --> 01:17:39.534
Fuck! They better be OK.

01:17:41.784 --> 01:17:43.742
Ricky?

01:17:45.742 --> 01:17:50.034
<i>Ricky?
Ricky, you little shite! Where are you?</i>

01:17:51.992 --> 01:17:57.284
Little bastard! I've got better things
to do. Mum's worried sick.

01:17:57.409 --> 01:18:01.200
This lady says she's been hunted.
You know about this?

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.825
Hey! Hey!

01:18:07.159 --> 01:18:08.950
Hey!

01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:12.201
Hey!

01:18:23.618 --> 01:18:25.826
Aaaargh!

01:19:24.661 --> 01:19:26.036
Aah!

01:20:22.704 --> 01:20:27.288
# Please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

01:20:27.413 --> 01:20:30.579
<i># Like us, hate us, but you'll... #</i>

01:20:30.704 --> 01:20:33.913
<i>Somebody, please help me!</i>

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:38.496
<i>#... respectable, respectable... #</i>

01:20:41.579 --> 01:20:44.496
Don't just stand there!

01:20:48.663 --> 01:20:50.913
<i>- Get her in the house.
- Come on, then.</i>

01:20:54.497 --> 01:20:58.747
- You've been through the wars.
- What happened?

01:20:58.872 --> 01:21:04.664
<i>- Come on, give her some air.
- That stings, sorry... Thanks, Tan.</i>

01:21:04.789 --> 01:21:08.247
We'll put this down here.

01:21:08.372 --> 01:21:12.872
- You're safe now.
- Lots of big ugly men around.

01:21:13.705 --> 01:21:16.705
I'm still at Uncle Jon's.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.789
<i>- A woman crashed in, looking like death.
- Mel!</i>

01:21:20.914 --> 01:21:24.039
That's a lovely ring. From your fella?

01:21:25.372 --> 01:21:27.872
What's that?

01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:31.664
<i>Hey, Clyde! Come here! Down! Out!</i>

01:21:31.789 --> 01:21:37.040
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
- Sorry. He's no good with strangers.

01:21:37.165 --> 01:21:40.915
<i>Mel? Mel, what's going on?</i>

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.956
What the fuck?! That's Reece's van!

01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:48.581
<i>- Go on, tell me!
- I'll fucking kill him!</i>

01:21:48.706 --> 01:21:52.665
- Hang on...
- Give me the fucking phone!

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:56.331
- Get me an ambulance.
- Jon?

01:21:56.456 --> 01:22:00.831
<i>Jon, get an ambulance.
Get this lady an ambulance.</i>

01:22:01.998 --> 01:22:06.873
<i>- I want the police.
- Eh? No, no, no. Don't worry, love.</i>

01:22:06.998 --> 01:22:09.706
You let us do that. Just stay here.

01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:14.248
- Ssh. You just sit quiet.
- I'm going to be sick.

01:22:14.373 --> 01:22:19.291
<i>I'll get you to the loo. Come on.
Come with me. Come on, love.</i>

01:22:21.374 --> 01:22:23.874
In here. Here we go.

01:22:24.916 --> 01:22:27.624
Lee Trevitt! Get out!

01:22:28.666 --> 01:22:30.749
Sorry about this.

01:22:31.582 --> 01:22:34.707
<i>Get out! Go on, love.</i>

01:22:40.332 --> 01:22:42.291
<i>Oh, God...</i>

01:22:49.707 --> 01:22:51.999
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God...</i>

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:36.250
Open the fucking door!

01:23:38.418 --> 01:23:40.501
Open it up!

01:23:40.626 --> 01:23:43.418
Open the fucking door!

01:23:52.918 --> 01:23:54.959
- Is this the lady?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.084 --> 01:23:59.251
<i>- You fucking slag! I'll fucking kill you!
- Come on, love!</i>

01:23:59.376 --> 01:24:03.543
- What's he told you? He's a liar!
- What about the van?!

01:24:03.668 --> 01:24:07.793
- They killed Steve!
- Your sick bastard boyfriend!

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:12.501
- Just call the police!
- What good are they to her?

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.501
Fuck!

01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:21.460
You want to play with the big boys now?
Eh? Eh?

01:24:21.585 --> 01:24:23.669
Jon... Jon...

01:24:23.794 --> 01:24:26.294
She killed her little one.

01:24:26.419 --> 01:24:31.585
Look at her.
You fucking look at her now!

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:39.127
- You fucking keep looking at her.
- They're just children!

01:24:39.252 --> 01:24:42.252
Just children! They're just children!

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:45.252
I didn't mean to...

01:24:45.377 --> 01:24:49.460
- They started this!
- And we're gonna finish it.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.460
<i>Look, there's dead kids, man.</i>

01:24:53.585 --> 01:24:57.877
- The police will ask questions.
- Doesn't mean they'll get any answers.

01:24:59.503 --> 01:25:02.211
We look after our own round here.

01:25:02.336 --> 01:25:06.211
- Now... Now take Brett to bed.
- No...

01:25:06.336 --> 01:25:10.003
<i>Brett, get upstairs now!
You little bastard!</i>

01:25:10.128 --> 01:25:12.420
Get upstairs now.

01:25:13.795 --> 01:25:16.503
<i>- Please, don't...!
- Sssh.</i>

01:25:16.628 --> 01:25:19.295
Just put her in the shower.

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.295
No-o-o!
