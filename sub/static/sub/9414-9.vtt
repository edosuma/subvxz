00:04.297 --> 00:07.467
I was struggling to breathe.

00:07.468 --> 00:09.769
What's going on here?

00:09.770 --> 00:13.010
What explains this pain?

00:13.474 --> 00:15.541
Where are we? What's going on?

00:15.542 --> 00:19.682
I recalled getting out of the truck.

00:22.916 --> 00:24.283
UFO was just sitting there.

00:24.284 --> 00:26.085
Travis, get back in the truck.

00:26.086 --> 00:29.522
I thought the world was coming to an end.

00:29.523 --> 00:31.383
Bam.

00:32.726 --> 00:34.560
I truly feared for my life.

00:34.561 --> 00:36.662
We saw this thing. I think it was a UFO.

00:36.663 --> 00:39.965
I thought it was a hoax of
some kind to cover up a crime.

00:39.966 --> 00:43.703
If he is not found, his disappearance
will remain a mystery.

00:43.704 --> 00:45.304
Where is the body of Travis Walton?

00:45.305 --> 00:50.109
I was amazed at the results
of the examinations.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.545
The fear was absolutely over the top.

00:52.546 --> 00:55.426
Stay away from me!

00:55.582 --> 00:59.842
Felt like I was fighting for my life.

01:15.636 --> 01:21.036
I sort of mark time in my
life by November 5, 1975.

01:25.546 --> 01:30.526
The trauma from this event
has never gone away.

01:33.487 --> 01:39.387
Even yet after all this time, to recall it
puts me there, and I sort of relive it.

01:42.195 --> 01:46.095
I was out of my mind with fear.

01:47.835 --> 01:53.735
Some people just keep telling
themselves such things can't happen.

01:54.608 --> 02:00.508
If you're gonna judge this,
first take a look at the facts.

02:00.948 --> 02:02.615
They brought me back.

02:02.616 --> 02:06.336
The facts speak for themselves.

02:17.998 --> 02:21.778
I was 22. I was young, single.

02:24.571 --> 02:29.809
Basically considered by the
locals to be a bit of a rebel,

02:29.810 --> 02:33.650
not being a real church regular.

02:34.848 --> 02:37.656
Travis was something.

02:37.657 --> 02:41.077
Travis did things his way.

02:43.590 --> 02:48.870
I remember him being a
fighter and wild bull rider.

02:50.183 --> 02:52.865
- Morning, easy rider.
- Morning.

02:52.866 --> 02:55.629
Could you possibly drive something a
little more quieter in the morning?

02:55.630 --> 02:57.271
I have to wake you up, don't I?

02:57.272 --> 03:00.907
We were headed out of the woods one day,
and then a bear ran across the road,

03:00.908 --> 03:04.510
and he jumped out and ran after it.

03:04.511 --> 03:07.271
Pretty tough kid.

03:08.114 --> 03:13.514
The news media very commonly
refers to us as loggers.

03:14.655 --> 03:18.855
There were seven of us in the truck.

03:25.599 --> 03:28.634
It was quite a long drive to get out there.

03:28.635 --> 03:34.535
Right up on one of the highest points
in the Sitgreaves National Forest.

03:38.779 --> 03:41.479
All right, boys.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.922
Mike Rogers was the crew boss.

03:49.923 --> 03:54.994
I had a contract to clear trees out
of an area, about 1,200 acres' worth.

03:54.995 --> 03:56.749
- Trav?
- Yeah.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.864
Him and Travis were real
good friends, you know?

03:58.865 --> 04:00.566
- Help him out?
- Yeah, sure.

04:00.567 --> 04:03.469
I had six men working for me.

04:03.470 --> 04:09.370
I wouldn't have hired them unless they
were all hard-working, level-headed guys.

04:10.143 --> 04:12.444
We were basically there
for the purpose of work,

04:12.445 --> 04:18.084
and it wasn't a group of
buddies or anything like that.

04:20.253 --> 04:22.955
John basically got along with everybody.

04:22.956 --> 04:26.558
It was a tough job, and it
was a tough bunch of people.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.577
Running a chainsaw, you had to
be fast and also be careful.

04:29.578 --> 04:33.866
A chainsaw won't slice you, but it
tears chunks of meat out of you.

04:33.867 --> 04:37.603
Kenny was a real straitlaced sort of a guy.

04:37.604 --> 04:41.750
I was raised in Mormonism, and I'd
been married a couple of years,

04:41.751 --> 04:44.691
and we had a baby.

04:45.245 --> 04:49.281
I was planning on doing some other
things, but in the interim, I was gonna

04:49.282 --> 04:52.985
work with Mike for a few weeks.

04:52.986 --> 04:56.488
Steve Pierce was the
youngest guy on the crew.

04:56.489 --> 05:00.292
I lied about my age to get the job.

05:00.293 --> 05:04.733
They didn't know I was 17 at the time.

05:05.457 --> 05:10.169
Mike thought I was 18, and I lied to him
because my mom was hurting for money,

05:10.170 --> 05:13.590
and I had to go to work.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.276
One of the guys had only
been on the job three days.

05:17.277 --> 05:22.039
Dwayne Smith, I don't think he was
that used to that kind of work.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.552
He wasn't stacking right, and
Mike jumped on me for it.

05:26.553 --> 05:30.156
I didn't like that too well.

05:30.157 --> 05:34.740
Allen was sort of the black sheep
of the crew, I guess you'd say.

05:34.741 --> 05:38.597
Allen Dalis and Travis Walton, they
didn't get along with each other.

05:38.598 --> 05:43.578
At one point during the
day, Allen cut a tree.

05:44.270 --> 05:50.170
It fell close enough to me to
where it was kind of alarming.

05:50.443 --> 05:55.123
I looked at Allen like, you know, watch it.

05:58.085 --> 06:02.585
We were putting in some pretty long days.

06:02.605 --> 06:05.147
You'd take a big, old
paper sack full of food,

06:05.148 --> 06:06.850
and we'd eat about three
times a day, you know?

06:06.851 --> 06:09.671
It was hard work.

06:09.755 --> 06:15.515
The contract was behind, so I
was pushing them extra hard.

06:18.050 --> 06:22.430
We worked until the sun was going down.

06:25.545 --> 06:29.925
That's a long day out there, you know?

06:35.388 --> 06:37.757
I can remember packing everything away.

06:37.758 --> 06:42.858
That's what was my job.
I packed the gear away.

06:47.565 --> 06:52.965
It was dark by the time we
got everything loaded up.

06:55.649 --> 07:01.548
The path that we were following
was along this logging trail.

07:01.549 --> 07:04.794
We really got to pick
up the slack tomorrow.

07:04.795 --> 07:07.301
Everybody's pretty beat, you know?
They're pretty tired.

07:07.302 --> 07:11.323
Enough about work, man.
Let's talk more about the women.

07:11.324 --> 07:14.326
We were talking about this girl or
that girl or going out partying.

07:14.327 --> 07:15.861
Does she have a sister?

07:15.862 --> 07:17.562
She's got three sisters, right?

07:17.563 --> 07:19.064
I love the girls, man.

07:19.065 --> 07:24.902
We hadn't driven very far when we caught
sight of a glow through the trees.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.089
Hey, guys, do you see all that?

07:27.090 --> 07:29.452
- What is that?
- What the heck is that?

07:29.453 --> 07:31.710
It was just little glimpses and glimmers.

07:31.711 --> 07:33.190
Is it the moon?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.214
At first, we thought it was the moon,

07:35.215 --> 07:37.749
and then off to the left,
you could see the moon.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.019
Moon's over here.

07:40.020 --> 07:43.322
I thought, what in the heck is it?

07:43.323 --> 07:45.825
Somebody said they thought
it was a forest fire.

07:45.826 --> 07:49.170
If it were a forest fire, there'd
be smoke coming over those trees.

07:49.171 --> 07:52.998
That's not fitting.
That doesn't look quite right.

07:52.999 --> 07:56.202
Someone was saying that it
could be a crashed plane.

07:56.203 --> 07:58.804
No, man. I've seen plane crashes before.

07:58.805 --> 08:02.869
I'd been in the navy.
It didn't appear that way to me.

08:02.870 --> 08:04.502
- Hey, Mike!
- I said, Mike, hurry up!

08:04.503 --> 08:08.747
Let's get up there where we can see.

08:08.748 --> 08:12.001
We come around this one bend,
and there's a clearing.

08:12.002 --> 08:13.010
Stop the truck!

08:13.011 --> 08:18.911
I was throwing the door open even
as the truck skidded to a stop.

08:19.359 --> 08:21.999
It was... Boom.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.169
UFO was just sitting there.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.855
It was a clearly defined metallic object.

08:33.856 --> 08:37.756
Hovering less than 100 feet away.

08:39.712 --> 08:43.249
Perfectly still, 15 feet off the ground.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.918
It was a white that I've never seen before.

08:46.919 --> 08:50.159
And haven't seen since.

08:51.224 --> 08:55.761
I'd never seen anything
defying gravity like that.

08:55.762 --> 08:58.397
I could actually see framework.

08:58.398 --> 09:01.433
It had panels that were lighted.

09:01.434 --> 09:04.194
It was beautiful.

09:05.005 --> 09:06.805
Ah, it was prettier than
a brand new corvette.

09:06.806 --> 09:08.846
Travis.

09:08.975 --> 09:11.877
It was terrifying, but it was beautiful.

09:11.878 --> 09:14.380
Get back in the truck.

09:14.381 --> 09:20.281
Everybody in the truck started yelling
at Travis to get away from there.

09:22.322 --> 09:25.382
Frightened all of us.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.794
The closer I got, the louder they got.

09:28.795 --> 09:30.095
Travis!

09:30.096 --> 09:35.134
He glanced back once, but
he didn't look scared.

09:35.135 --> 09:41.035
I thought it would be gone before I got
close enough for it to be dangerous.

09:43.855 --> 09:47.455
My heart was really pounding.

09:48.748 --> 09:53.118
The closer I got to it, the more I
realized that it wasn't gonna take off.

09:53.119 --> 09:58.639
It was really terrifying and
exciting at the same time.

10:02.232 --> 10:06.432
But I was looking up at about a 45.

10:08.201 --> 10:11.081
It was like glass.

10:11.438 --> 10:14.994
It was making these strange sounds...

10:14.995 --> 10:19.555
That suddenly got louder and more powerful.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.952
Soon the light would be coming alive.

10:26.953 --> 10:30.853
Like it was winding up to leave.

10:34.194 --> 10:38.994
I knew something was
gonna happen right then.

10:39.332 --> 10:43.232
Can I make a run for the truck?

10:49.042 --> 10:53.205
This greenish blue light
came out and zapped him.

10:53.206 --> 10:56.866
I really thought he was dead.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.620
He went about 15, 20 feet.

11:19.621 --> 11:23.191
I immediately thought they'd killed
him, and they were gonna kill us.

11:23.192 --> 11:25.137
The guys were all screaming at me to leave.

11:25.138 --> 11:27.628
They said, they've got him.

11:27.629 --> 11:29.463
I felt the jerk of the pickup.

11:29.464 --> 11:33.904
Hit the gas and took off down the road.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.797
Everybody was yelling.

11:40.842 --> 11:43.422
Complete panic.

11:44.546 --> 11:48.686
Is it following us? Is it after us?

11:49.851 --> 11:55.751
Mike kept saying it was following us, but
I don't think anybody was looking back.

11:57.626 --> 11:59.928
I was terrified.

11:59.929 --> 12:03.469
I truly feared for my life.

12:04.766 --> 12:08.169
If the thing that we saw didn't scare
them, my driving certainly did.

12:08.170 --> 12:10.450
Slow down!

12:16.011 --> 12:18.212
- I want to go home.
- I saw it! I saw it!

12:18.213 --> 12:20.315
- I know.
- What are you doing?

12:20.316 --> 12:22.083
We got to get out of here.

12:22.084 --> 12:24.885
We need to think.
We need to think about this. We can't...

12:24.886 --> 12:27.655
Total confusion when we come to a stop.

12:27.656 --> 12:32.576
Just let's think for a
second, guys, come on.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.820
Brought to our knees like that.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.534
I got to go. I got to go home.

12:40.535 --> 12:44.015
A real traumatic experience.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.348
Whew.

12:53.349 --> 12:55.269
Um...

13:01.056 --> 13:03.576
It was scary.

13:06.228 --> 13:07.528
- I need to go home.
- We've got to go!

13:07.529 --> 13:09.097
I can't be here anymore.

13:09.098 --> 13:11.932
Just be quiet for a second, guys.
I've gotta to think this through.

13:11.933 --> 13:14.068
- I can't stay here!
- I can't be here anymore.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.436
Guys, just calm down.

13:15.437 --> 13:18.339
Just calm down! Shh!

13:18.340 --> 13:20.574
I got to think. I got to think.
I got to think.

13:20.575 --> 13:21.742
Come back...

13:21.743 --> 13:23.306
Just let me think for a minute.

13:23.307 --> 13:25.980
Come on, man. Get back in the truck.

13:25.981 --> 13:28.116
We've got to get home.

13:28.117 --> 13:31.597
I knew we had to go back.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.955
- Mike, we have to go.
- We have to leave.

13:34.956 --> 13:36.790
The guys argued about it.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.323
We got to get out of here, man.

13:38.324 --> 13:40.594
- He's gone.
- He could just be uncon...

13:40.595 --> 13:42.530
I thought the world was coming to an end.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.298
We don't even know what happened.

13:44.299 --> 13:45.799
You saw it. It hit him in the chest.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.769
One of the other guys
said he was incinerated.

13:48.770 --> 13:50.771
He went flying 20 feet.

13:50.772 --> 13:52.273
- I saw it.
- You saw it.

13:52.274 --> 13:53.941
I had assumed it had killed him.

13:53.942 --> 13:55.776
He's incinerated. You saw it.

13:55.777 --> 13:57.845
I said no, I seen him hit the ground.

13:57.846 --> 14:00.114
He's there. He's there. He's there.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.745
I'm gonna go back and check.
You guys can wait here.

14:02.746 --> 14:06.354
So I told them, well, you can stand here
and wait, but this truck's going back.

14:06.355 --> 14:08.256
I'll come back and pick you up, okay?

14:08.257 --> 14:09.823
- Just wait here.
- The light!

14:09.824 --> 14:11.325
I'll go back and...

14:11.326 --> 14:13.794
All of the guys decided
to stay in the truck.

14:13.795 --> 14:17.000
They didn't want to wait in the dark.

14:17.001 --> 14:22.901
Either you're gonna go back, or you're
gonna be out beside the road by yourself.

14:27.652 --> 14:33.515
I was thinking he was lying there,
and I thought we'd find a body.

14:33.516 --> 14:36.996
You just knew he was dead.

14:47.362 --> 14:50.722
We got back to the spot.

14:52.134 --> 14:53.568
Travis?

14:53.569 --> 14:56.509
The thing was gone.

14:57.806 --> 15:00.506
Travis was gone.

15:01.776 --> 15:05.713
He was right here.
I swear, we left him right here.

15:05.714 --> 15:07.045
Travis, where are you?

15:07.046 --> 15:08.416
We was all hollerin' for him.

15:08.417 --> 15:09.584
Travis!

15:09.585 --> 15:11.610
- Travis!
- Travis!

15:11.611 --> 15:13.038
See he wasn't in the clearing,

15:13.039 --> 15:16.365
so we started walking through
the trees around the perimeter.

15:16.366 --> 15:19.127
- Travis, where are you?
- He's gone.

15:19.128 --> 15:24.265
We stayed in a real close
bunch, shoulder to shoulder.

15:24.266 --> 15:25.699
It was very scary.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.280
Travis. Travis!

15:30.458 --> 15:32.640
Mike realized he was gone.

15:32.641 --> 15:36.301
Let's get back to the truck.

15:36.796 --> 15:39.976
He kind of broke down.

15:41.517 --> 15:45.897
I realized we left him there, you know.

15:51.799 --> 15:54.739
I was very ashamed.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.753
I can't!

16:09.223 --> 16:11.803
We... We left.

16:13.448 --> 16:16.148
Drove into town.

16:19.588 --> 16:20.988
We can't go to the cops, man.

16:20.989 --> 16:24.049
We got to... Let's just get out of here.
Let's go home, guys.

16:24.050 --> 16:27.578
We were confused, not
knowing exactly what to do.

16:27.579 --> 16:30.448
We can't go home.

16:30.449 --> 16:31.632
We have to go home.

16:31.633 --> 16:35.703
At least three of us were pretty
apprehensive about calling the law.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.238
I didn't want to call the cops

16:37.239 --> 16:39.207
because I knew the cops weren't
gonna believe us anyway.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.275
They're never gonna believe us, man.

16:41.276 --> 16:44.978
Yeah, my friend just got zapped by a UFO.
I can't find him.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.981
Allen Dalis had been in
trouble with the law before

16:47.982 --> 16:50.351
and said something to try to discourage it.

16:50.352 --> 16:51.919
Mike, I can't talk to the cops.

16:51.920 --> 16:57.680
That's what we had to do, you
know, to try to find him.

16:59.194 --> 17:04.473
Mike was just too upset to
even make a phone call.

17:05.300 --> 17:10.271
I didn't want to be the one to explain
it to somebody like a Sheriff.

17:10.271 --> 17:13.441
I was afraid to tell them
anything about a UFO.

17:13.442 --> 17:15.843
I need to report a missing person.

17:15.844 --> 17:19.204
Said he'd be right over.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.050
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.720
Everybody was pretty close
to hysterical about it.

17:25.721 --> 17:27.896
- We shouldn't have called the cops.
- We need help.

17:27.897 --> 17:29.323
We don't have any other choice.

17:29.324 --> 17:34.371
And it was awful lying about it because
you just cause yourself more problems.

17:34.372 --> 17:36.130
There was no hiding that
something had happened.

17:36.131 --> 17:37.765
We have to tell them what we saw.

17:37.766 --> 17:43.666
Only thing you could tell him was...
Just tell him the truth.

17:46.141 --> 17:49.681
I can remember him arriving.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.680
He didn't look too happy.

17:52.681 --> 17:55.201
Evening, boys.

17:55.216 --> 17:57.017
What's going on?

17:57.018 --> 17:58.419
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.352
You're never gonna believe
me, but we saw this thing,

18:00.353 --> 18:01.855
and I think it was a UFO, okay?

18:01.856 --> 18:04.692
I was looking at his face.

18:04.693 --> 18:06.827
I was expecting total disbelief.

18:06.828 --> 18:08.529
And it took our friend Travis, all right?

18:08.530 --> 18:10.531
He's out there somewhere.
We don't know where he is.

18:10.532 --> 18:13.352
All of them were trying
to talk at once to...

18:13.353 --> 18:16.261
Explain what they had...

18:16.262 --> 18:17.971
Apparently seen.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.775
- We don't know what happened to him.
- Extreme light! I don't know...

18:20.776 --> 18:22.576
You boys been drinking tonight?

18:22.577 --> 18:24.679
Absolutely not. We've been working all day.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.648
He looked over the pickup.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.984
Anyway, so Travis gets out of the truck...

18:30.985 --> 18:35.856
He thought we were drinking and
partying and stuff, you know?

18:35.857 --> 18:39.293
All of them seemed to
be shook up with fear.

18:39.294 --> 18:41.762
He's missing. He's out there.
You've got to find him.

18:41.763 --> 18:44.557
Well, they were acting pretty excited but,

18:44.558 --> 18:46.567
I thought they were just
putting on, really.

18:46.568 --> 18:49.303
So what you're saying is, is this
here is a missing persons case?

18:49.304 --> 18:51.038
Yes.

18:51.039 --> 18:54.775
I did not put much stock in the UFO story.

18:54.776 --> 18:56.708
They took him. He's gone.

18:56.709 --> 18:57.812
Okay.

18:57.813 --> 19:03.693
I thought it was a hoax of
some kind to cover up a crime.

19:24.915 --> 19:28.395
That's a negative, Sheriff.

19:33.796 --> 19:37.283
The next day, everybody headed back there.

19:37.284 --> 19:43.184
We made a decision to get a
large search party in the area.

19:43.778 --> 19:47.301
My primary thought was we would
be searching for a body,

19:47.302 --> 19:50.275
or an injured individual.

19:50.276 --> 19:56.176
We had about 60 men out there searching,
looking in all the brush piles.

19:57.751 --> 20:01.186
If he'd wandered off in
a daze or something,

20:01.187 --> 20:06.125
being as cold as it was, he
could've frozen to death.

20:06.126 --> 20:08.763
In my mind, Travis is dead.

20:08.764 --> 20:11.897
I ain't going back out there with 100 cops.

20:11.898 --> 20:17.369
So while my mom was talking to them,
I just snuck out the back door.

20:17.370 --> 20:20.670
I hid a lot after that.

20:22.308 --> 20:25.318
The searchers just fanned out
in different directions,

20:25.319 --> 20:30.916
searched for a mile or two and then doubled
back and take a different route back.

20:30.917 --> 20:36.817
They found every piece of paper
and coffee cup and plastic bag.

20:38.091 --> 20:43.551
We also had some volunteer
people with geiger counters.

20:45.265 --> 20:48.267
I looked over and noticed these
guys had some instruments.

20:48.268 --> 20:49.501
Excuse me.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.556
I asked them what they were doing.

20:51.557 --> 20:54.006
Just checking for radiation.

20:54.007 --> 20:55.274
Are you finding anything?

20:55.275 --> 20:58.610
Nothing. Just background radiation.

20:58.611 --> 21:03.231
And I says, well, why don't you check us?

21:04.550 --> 21:08.386
He ran this machine over me, and
there wasn't any radiation.

21:08.387 --> 21:11.002
- You're clean.
- Okay, but we showered...

21:11.003 --> 21:15.122
But then I remembered, you know, we had
all changed clothes and everything.

21:15.123 --> 21:17.196
And I said, well, I have our hard hats.

21:17.197 --> 21:19.097
Here. Check these.

21:19.098 --> 21:21.378
All right.

21:24.537 --> 21:27.657
And the needle went...

21:27.741 --> 21:31.143
Seconds after that, they left.

21:31.144 --> 21:33.678
Hey, do you know who those guys are?

21:33.679 --> 21:36.315
What they're doing here?

21:36.316 --> 21:39.736
Nobody knew who they were.

21:43.323 --> 21:47.459
The second day of the search,
we had a helicopter.

21:47.460 --> 21:50.562
They circled a wide area.

21:50.563 --> 21:54.362
Our thoughts were that this
individual could have traveled,

21:54.363 --> 21:57.543
a pretty good distance.

21:58.593 --> 22:03.608
He might be holed up in some
abandoned ranch house or a cabin,

22:03.609 --> 22:09.509
so we made it a point to check every
building 20 miles around the site.

22:11.891 --> 22:16.021
Law enforcement officials say they are
treating this case as a missing person.

22:16.022 --> 22:19.052
They are searching on foot and
by helicopter, just as they

22:19.053 --> 22:21.927
would for anyone lost in this
rugged part of the state.

22:21.928 --> 22:26.031
Five of the group knew Walton
for 3 to as much as 12 years.

22:26.032 --> 22:28.901
The sixth met him Monday
for the first time.

22:28.902 --> 22:32.137
The area around Heber is full of
deer hunters this time of year.

22:32.138 --> 22:35.599
If Walton is there, searchers
believe he will be found.

22:35.600 --> 22:39.209
If he is not found, his disappearance
will remain what it is now...

22:39.210 --> 22:40.512
A mystery.

22:40.513 --> 22:42.948
They were searching pretty thorough.

22:42.949 --> 22:45.984
And the Sheriff was very serious about it.

22:45.985 --> 22:50.485
But his deputy Sheriff was very skeptical.

22:51.024 --> 22:53.158
You know, if you boys just
tell us where the body is,

22:53.159 --> 22:54.759
we can get this over with and all go home.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.996
He starts telling me, hey, tell
us what you did to Travis.

22:57.997 --> 22:59.857
Huh?

23:00.071 --> 23:01.833
He chuckled and he said...

23:01.834 --> 23:06.171
I suppose Travis is halfway
up to Mars by now.

23:06.172 --> 23:10.909
He told me that he was the best
bloodhound in Navajo County.

23:10.910 --> 23:14.446
I know something happened up here.

23:14.447 --> 23:17.449
Because I didn't believe
the story from the start.

23:17.450 --> 23:23.210
If you tell us the truth,
we'll go a lot easier on you.

23:25.758 --> 23:27.508
Hadn't thought much about,

23:27.509 --> 23:30.628
the repercussions for us if, you
know, Travis wasn't returned.

23:30.629 --> 23:34.466
All the boys have reported in.
They've seen nothing all night, Sheriff.

23:34.467 --> 23:37.269
We made a thorough search of the area.

23:37.270 --> 23:39.371
Unit two, you anything?

23:39.372 --> 23:41.239
That's a negative, Sheriff.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.442
And of course, we didn't find anything.

23:43.443 --> 23:45.377
That's it for tonight. All right?

23:45.378 --> 23:48.213
We did not find any sign of a crime.

23:48.214 --> 23:52.714
We didn't find any indications of a UFO.

24:04.397 --> 24:07.332
Sheriff's office. Deputy Coplan.
What can I help you with?

24:07.333 --> 24:11.593
The news by then had spread worldwide.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.175
No, it's a missing persons case.

24:17.176 --> 24:20.920
We were trying to do our regular business,
and we just couldn't get anything done.

24:20.921 --> 24:22.347
We only had one phone line.

24:22.348 --> 24:23.882
Oh, for Pete's sake.

24:23.883 --> 24:25.917
There's no aliens. There's no spacecrafts.

24:25.918 --> 24:29.450
I always told them just what I thought.

24:29.451 --> 24:30.850
Sheriff!

24:30.851 --> 24:33.402
They didn't want to talk to anyone else.

24:33.403 --> 24:35.360
They wanted the Sheriff.

24:35.361 --> 24:37.729
Sheriff Gillespie.

24:37.730 --> 24:41.266
I felt stress over the entire situation.

24:41.267 --> 24:44.736
As far as we're concerned, this
is just a missing persons case.

24:44.737 --> 24:46.957
Good-bye.

24:50.609 --> 24:53.478
Just as soon as you hang
up, somebody else calling.

24:53.479 --> 24:56.014
Sheriff Gillespie.

24:56.015 --> 24:59.017
It felt like I had a telephone
growing out of both ears.

24:59.018 --> 25:00.852
He's probably holed up
in the woods somewhere.

25:00.853 --> 25:02.620
I got tired of it.

25:02.621 --> 25:04.073
That's right. No.

25:04.074 --> 25:08.819
Sometimes I was frustrated and
maybe a little short with them.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.878
I'm going out for coffee.

25:10.879 --> 25:13.099
Yes, Sir.

25:19.092 --> 25:24.543
It'd been four days of searching,
and there was no trace of him.

25:24.544 --> 25:28.924
That's when the accusations came around.

25:29.148 --> 25:33.408
Most of town thought we'd killed him.

25:36.789 --> 25:38.457
I'd hear shouts from people driving by.

25:38.458 --> 25:41.278
Where's the body?

25:43.496 --> 25:49.396
I started getting scared about it,
wondering where this was gonna lead.

25:52.572 --> 25:53.771
Hey, boys.

25:53.772 --> 25:57.875
At that point, my thoughts were
that they had done harm to this guy

25:57.876 --> 26:01.808
and was trying to do
something to cover that up.

26:01.809 --> 26:02.981
What's this?

26:02.982 --> 26:05.650
You boys still sticking to your story?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.919
It's the truth.

26:07.920 --> 26:13.492
He thought they had probably knocked
Travis in the head and buried him.

26:13.493 --> 26:17.347
How would you feel about submitting
to a polygraph examination?

26:17.348 --> 26:18.636
What?

26:18.637 --> 26:21.637
A lie detector test.

26:22.193 --> 26:25.303
That's when the nervousness came in.

26:25.304 --> 26:26.738
We knew we had to do it.

26:26.739 --> 26:28.173
Did you really see a UFO?

26:28.174 --> 26:30.175
Comment. Can you give us a comment?

26:30.176 --> 26:31.576
My mom brung me.

26:31.577 --> 26:33.694
Do you really think that
you saw a UFO that night?

26:33.695 --> 26:35.614
Where's the body?

26:35.615 --> 26:38.617
- Did you really see a UFO?
- You saw a UFO...

26:38.618 --> 26:40.018
There was a lot of people there.

26:40.019 --> 26:42.344
Do you think you'll pass
the polygraph test?

26:42.345 --> 26:45.807
Lot of media, a lot of cameras.

26:45.808 --> 26:47.292
They were really pushing us.

26:47.293 --> 26:49.203
Where is the body of Travis Walton?

26:49.204 --> 26:50.331
Did we kill him?

26:50.332 --> 26:52.049
Do you really believe that
you saw a UFO that night?

26:52.050 --> 26:54.518
- Where's the body?
- Did you really see a UFO?

26:54.519 --> 26:57.118
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Tell us what happened.

26:57.119 --> 26:59.432
I do remember telling them,
I don't know what it was.

26:59.433 --> 27:00.891
It's not from this planet.

27:00.892 --> 27:01.892
John!

27:01.893 --> 27:06.213
- Where did you hide the body?
- John!

27:07.086 --> 27:12.139
All right, folks.
Please leave the Courthouse steps.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.741
You're gonna be here for a while,
so make yourselves comfortable.

27:15.742 --> 27:19.282
I'd say we were locked up.

27:24.445 --> 27:27.580
We were starting to get
pretty scared about it.

27:27.581 --> 27:29.153
What if this is just a setup?

27:29.154 --> 27:30.976
What if John didn't see the
exact same thing as me?

27:30.977 --> 27:33.286
What if he says something different?
Then they think we're all lying.

27:33.287 --> 27:38.791
They were all arguing with each other,
trying to decide what to say and...

27:38.792 --> 27:40.514
I was scared to death, you know.

27:40.515 --> 27:42.015
This don't feel good.

27:42.016 --> 27:44.539
No, this doesn't feel good at all.

27:44.540 --> 27:48.920
It was a bad day. It was a scary day.

27:52.226 --> 27:55.073
We were introduced to a lie detector guy.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.230
Gentlemen, this is Mr. Cy Gilson.

27:57.231 --> 27:58.766
Cy Gilson was his name.

27:58.767 --> 28:00.701
He'll be administering the polygraph tests.

28:00.702 --> 28:03.130
Please give him your undivided attention.

28:03.131 --> 28:05.591
Morning, all.

28:06.047 --> 28:10.477
He was a top-rated polygraph
examiner in the state of Arizona.

28:10.478 --> 28:13.325
I assume that nobody here has
gone through this before,

28:13.326 --> 28:16.717
so I'll let you know what we're doing here.

28:16.718 --> 28:21.054
I gave them a brief idea of
what we were going to do.

28:21.055 --> 28:26.095
We start off with a series
of control questions.

28:26.194 --> 28:28.432
He sounded and acted rather skeptical.

28:28.433 --> 28:33.434
So those are the questions,
if y'all want to have a look.

28:33.435 --> 28:38.294
And I was scared once I saw
what the tests were for.

28:38.295 --> 28:41.375
I'm starting to realize
this isn't for a UFO.

28:41.376 --> 28:44.316
This is for murder.

28:57.421 --> 29:03.241
So those are the questions,
if y'all want to have a look.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.077
- No.
- What's it say?

29:05.078 --> 29:07.580
- No, it was not that kind of...
- What does it say?

29:07.581 --> 29:09.079
What kind of questions are these?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.446
We had a confrontation.

29:10.447 --> 29:12.037
Are these questions set up?

29:12.038 --> 29:13.287
We're trying to get at the truth here.

29:13.288 --> 29:14.299
Is this a setup?

29:14.300 --> 29:17.136
I want to know what kind of questions...

29:17.137 --> 29:19.466
Allen Dalis' mother was telling us

29:19.467 --> 29:21.901
that they were gonna set it
up to where we look guilty.

29:21.902 --> 29:24.127
This isn't funny. This is our lives.

29:24.128 --> 29:27.542
They didn't trust me to start with...

29:27.543 --> 29:31.032
Even though they did not
know me or my reputation.

29:31.033 --> 29:33.648
- This is the best way...
- We came here to show you the truth.

29:33.649 --> 29:35.529
Mike, Mike, get your boys in order.

29:35.530 --> 29:38.272
- Boys, please.
- Tell your boys to calm down.

29:38.273 --> 29:40.788
The Sheriff guaranteed that
the tests would be fair.

29:40.789 --> 29:42.460
Just relax, all right?

29:42.461 --> 29:44.770
So I finally agreed to it.

29:44.771 --> 29:47.591
See you all soon.

29:47.664 --> 29:51.742
I was expecting that the
results would disclose

29:51.743 --> 29:55.249
that they had done
something to Travis Walton

29:55.250 --> 29:59.810
and this was a hoax to cover up a crime.

30:04.363 --> 30:08.669
I was more scared that day
than the day we saw the UFO.

30:08.670 --> 30:13.614
Because I thought we was gonna
go to prison for murder.

30:13.615 --> 30:16.075
Steve Pierce.

30:16.245 --> 30:17.258
You're up, son.

30:17.259 --> 30:22.599
And I was the first one to
take the polygraph test.

30:29.285 --> 30:35.073
All right, son, take off your
jacket and have a seat, please.

30:35.074 --> 30:36.842
He was all business.

30:36.843 --> 30:40.212
For your respiration.
This is gonna measure your blood pressure.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.814
Okay, now I want you to relax.

30:41.815 --> 30:43.115
He told me to be calm.

30:43.116 --> 30:46.852
I want you to answer truthfully.

30:46.853 --> 30:49.493
All right, son?

30:53.860 --> 30:55.694
It was hard to be calm.

30:55.695 --> 30:59.791
Take a few deep breaths, and remember,
it's important to tell me the truth.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.935
He was the youngest of the group.

31:02.936 --> 31:08.515
He would probably be the easiest
one to get a confession from.

31:08.516 --> 31:11.243
Do you know if Travis Walton's body

31:11.244 --> 31:15.416
is buried or hidden somewhere
in the Turkey Springs area?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.133
No.

31:17.134 --> 31:20.486
I figured, me being so nervous, that
I would flunk it no matter what.

31:20.487 --> 31:26.387
Did you do anything physical to cause
Travis' death or to cause him injury?

31:27.026 --> 31:28.087
No.

31:28.088 --> 31:32.404
In my case, the tests were
looked on as having...

31:32.405 --> 31:37.085
Ninety two to ninety
seven percent accuracy.

31:37.384 --> 31:42.244
Are you telling the truth
about seeing a UFO?

31:44.845 --> 31:46.705
Yes.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.750
Took me about two hours or so for each one.

31:51.751 --> 31:54.833
I would not tell any of the individuals

31:54.834 --> 31:59.692
how they did when they
finished the examination.

31:59.693 --> 32:01.827
I was by myself.

32:01.828 --> 32:04.630
I guess they didn't want
us talking afterwards.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.091
Ken Peterson.

32:07.713 --> 32:09.144
He's an eager beaver.

32:09.145 --> 32:14.305
I've had dreams about being
on my way to prison.

32:15.274 --> 32:20.579
Did you do anything physical to cause
Travis' death or to cause him injury?

32:20.580 --> 32:24.316
I don't know how much of an
emotional reaction you had to show.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.985
No.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.248
And the thoughts of ending
up in jail because he's gone

32:29.249 --> 32:34.169
and we can't explain the
right reason for it.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.861
John Goulette.

32:35.862 --> 32:38.531
I was starting to get
quite worried about it,

32:38.532 --> 32:40.160
especially when they weren't coming back.

32:40.161 --> 32:43.068
Are you telling the truth
about seeing a UFO?

32:43.069 --> 32:44.156
Yes, Sir.

32:44.157 --> 32:46.537
Is it gonna show that I'm
lying because I'm scared?

32:46.538 --> 32:48.741
- Are you telling the truth...
- Yes.

32:48.742 --> 32:50.642
- Are you telling the truth...
- Yes.

32:50.643 --> 32:52.045
Why are you asking me these questions?

32:52.046 --> 32:55.400
Dalis and Travis had a personal conflict.

32:55.401 --> 33:00.519
Did you do anything physical to cause
Travis' death or to cause him injury?

33:00.520 --> 33:01.887
What kind of question is that?

33:01.888 --> 33:04.623
He was not gonna cooperate at all.

33:04.624 --> 33:06.627
Will you just answer the
question yes or no, Sir?

33:06.628 --> 33:07.925
Why would you ask me that question?

33:07.926 --> 33:09.862
He would move his arm or something,

33:09.863 --> 33:13.599
and these movements caused
deflection of the pins,

33:13.600 --> 33:19.240
and at the end, no determination
could be made with him.

33:20.800 --> 33:25.377
The tests took all day
and up into the evening.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.127
Where the hell is he going?

33:27.128 --> 33:30.315
I wanted to have another examiner

33:30.316 --> 33:33.916
review the charge first before
I'd give a final answer.

33:33.917 --> 33:36.658
Hey, where are you going?

33:36.659 --> 33:39.725
I don't know about you
gents, but I'm going home.

33:39.726 --> 33:40.726
We'd ask him...

33:40.727 --> 33:42.948
What about the results?

33:42.949 --> 33:45.876
He says, I can't really discuss the tests.

33:45.877 --> 33:48.366
We've been waiting all day.
You got to be able to tell us something.

33:48.367 --> 33:51.136
I'm afraid Allen's test was incomplete.

33:51.137 --> 33:53.405
We had to do a little pressuring.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.886
What about the rest of us?

33:57.877 --> 33:59.745
He says, as far as I can see...

33:59.746 --> 34:03.346
Y'all are telling the truth.

34:03.646 --> 34:07.666
Five of the six passed examination.

34:11.161 --> 34:13.592
Just... My...

34:13.592 --> 34:18.003
All the suspicion was just pressing down
on you, and then we could breathe easy.

34:18.004 --> 34:20.704
Good day, gents.

34:21.567 --> 34:23.936
And everything from that point...

34:23.937 --> 34:26.841
Well, everything wasn't better but...

34:26.842 --> 34:31.822
At least we were no longer
suspected of murder.

34:34.514 --> 34:37.668
I don't think it's even possible...

34:37.670 --> 34:41.810
For five of those individuals
to answer the same questions...

34:41.811 --> 34:44.732
And beat me at my game.

34:44.733 --> 34:46.652
Well?

34:47.426 --> 34:48.893
I remember telling the Sheriff...

34:48.895 --> 34:50.489
They all passed.

34:50.491 --> 34:52.056
What?

34:52.056 --> 34:55.868
- And, of course, he's...
- What about the UFO?

34:55.869 --> 34:58.342
It's not a hoax.

34:58.343 --> 35:02.127
I don't know what it was,
but they saw something.

35:02.128 --> 35:04.575
He was a bit shocked.

35:04.576 --> 35:09.796
I think, if I remember the
expression on his face.

35:09.916 --> 35:12.332
They're not lying to you about that.

35:12.333 --> 35:16.113
A little surprised, yes, I was.

35:19.926 --> 35:24.606
Speechless for a matter of a minute or two.

35:26.365 --> 35:30.085
But still there was no Travis.

35:33.073 --> 35:35.833
It's me, Travis.

35:36.155 --> 35:39.215
They brought me back.

35:56.927 --> 36:01.427
I was laying on the edge of the highway.

36:01.761 --> 36:04.929
I could see there was a
light coming from above.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.633
But before I could shift my gaze...

36:07.634 --> 36:10.574
The light went out.

36:10.748 --> 36:15.008
I could see the bottom of this craft.

36:15.221 --> 36:18.581
It just shot straight up.

36:26.598 --> 36:31.758
I immediately shifted my
attention to, where am I?

36:34.035 --> 36:38.235
I felt kind of unsure of my footing.

36:38.944 --> 36:41.704
Took off running.

36:45.717 --> 36:50.277
I was energized by the feeling of freedom.

36:52.524 --> 36:56.424
I recognized the town down below.

36:57.162 --> 36:59.397
I ran towards the lights.

36:59.398 --> 37:04.618
Took every bit of strength
I had to get that far.

37:11.476 --> 37:12.610
I called my brother-in-law.

37:12.611 --> 37:15.371
It's me, Travis.

37:15.614 --> 37:17.148
They brought me back.

37:17.149 --> 37:20.618
He thought it was a prank call.

37:20.619 --> 37:21.952
No, it's Travis.

37:21.953 --> 37:24.830
I screamed, no, it's me!
It's me! It's Travis!

37:24.831 --> 37:27.723
I'm at the gas station...

37:27.724 --> 37:29.944
In Heber.

37:37.069 --> 37:40.429
I just kind of collapsed.

37:43.462 --> 37:47.351
It seemed like, boom, lights
coming into the phone booth.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.392
Travis.

37:56.548 --> 37:57.825
That light in the forest...

37:57.826 --> 38:02.206
My brother Dwayne sat there next to me.

38:03.062 --> 38:04.837
I tried to tell him what I'd been through.

38:04.838 --> 38:06.695
It's okay.

38:06.696 --> 38:10.568
I just broke down so much that he
said, okay, just don't try to talk.

38:10.569 --> 38:13.404
We've missed you for the past few days.

38:13.405 --> 38:15.625
Few days?

38:15.774 --> 38:19.243
What do you mean days, you know?

38:19.244 --> 38:23.624
My brother says, Travis, feel your face.

38:24.549 --> 38:27.618
And I felt a five-day growth of beard.

38:27.619 --> 38:31.519
We need to get you to a doctor.

38:32.524 --> 38:35.913
I just kind of went catatonic there.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.674
Kind of gave up.

38:43.969 --> 38:47.338
I was in a constant state of terror.

38:47.339 --> 38:53.239
The memories of what I'd been
through, I just couldn't let it go.

39:04.823 --> 39:07.720
My brother Dwayne took me to Phoenix.

39:07.721 --> 39:12.401
And set about trying to get me checked out.

39:14.767 --> 39:19.411
His demeanor was compatible with
being through some type of...

39:19.412 --> 39:22.352
Traumatic experience.

39:25.110 --> 39:29.430
One might call it maybe slightly dazed.

39:29.648 --> 39:32.694
We did some blood work on him...

39:32.695 --> 39:34.525
Chemical tests...

39:34.526 --> 39:36.389
Blood count...

39:36.390 --> 39:38.222
Blood proteins.

39:38.223 --> 39:41.726
I was looking for signs of trauma.
I was looking for signs of exposure.

39:41.727 --> 39:43.928
What is this here?

39:43.929 --> 39:47.010
The only sign of any trauma was a little,

39:47.011 --> 39:50.191
possible injection site.

39:54.940 --> 39:57.041
Then we went back to Dwayne's house.

39:57.042 --> 39:59.322
Let's go.

40:00.910 --> 40:03.501
- Dwayne spoke to the Sheriff.
- Dwayne Walton.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.267
The Sheriff apparently already
knew that I had been returned.

40:06.268 --> 40:08.285
Yes. Yeah, he's here.

40:08.286 --> 40:11.789
They tried to discourage
me from coming to Phoenix.

40:11.790 --> 40:13.781
No one is gonna see him until
I am satisfied he's okay.

40:13.782 --> 40:19.297
The Sheriff was insistent that he
needed to interview me personally.

40:19.298 --> 40:24.338
I immediately left Holbrook
and drove to Phoenix.

40:27.539 --> 40:33.439
When I first went in the house,
Travis was sitting on a couch.

40:34.346 --> 40:36.947
He looked like he was very tired.

40:36.948 --> 40:40.651
There was a kind of a
tension, nervous tension.

40:40.652 --> 40:44.222
And I said... Just tell me what happened.

40:44.223 --> 40:49.571
What I related to the Sheriff was rather
broken and got a little confused.

40:49.572 --> 40:55.266
I was in no condition to be interviewed
about what had happened to me.

40:55.267 --> 41:00.304
I felt the law enforcement
was the victim of a fraud,

41:00.305 --> 41:04.175
but we were not able to get
evidence that would lend

41:04.176 --> 41:08.112
to any prosecution or
further investigation.

41:08.113 --> 41:12.583
Travis Walton, on numerous occasions, told
friends he would attempt to make contact

41:12.584 --> 41:15.719
if he ever came close
enough to a flying object.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.856
The rest of the group is openly
criticized in Snowflake.

41:18.857 --> 41:21.492
A town with a strong
family church foundation,

41:21.493 --> 41:24.728
the young people with long hair
and anti-establishment attitude

41:24.729 --> 41:26.560
don't mix well there.

41:26.561 --> 41:29.167
It was becoming more and more apparent

41:29.168 --> 41:34.088
that the news media had
gotten onto the story.

41:35.734 --> 41:38.142
Dwayne Walton.

41:38.143 --> 41:40.358
No. No, he's not here.

41:40.359 --> 41:44.970
Dwayne's saying, well, yeah he's
back, but we took him to a hospital.

41:44.971 --> 41:47.011
Tucson.

41:48.387 --> 41:50.120
No, in a hospital.

41:50.121 --> 41:55.250
Of course, then every hospital in Tucson
started getting calls from everywhere.

41:55.251 --> 42:01.011
My brother, he really put himself
out there to protect me.

42:02.359 --> 42:05.198
He's not able to speak at this time.

42:05.199 --> 42:10.419
He was at his strongest
when I was at my weakest.

42:13.235 --> 42:16.824
It just seemed like a nightmare
that wasn't going away.

42:16.825 --> 42:19.045
You okay?

42:20.007 --> 42:23.087
Pretty soon, the National
Enquirer's on his doorstep.

42:23.088 --> 42:24.755
I hear your brother's back in town.

42:24.756 --> 42:30.561
In exchange for an exclusive on the story,
they were willing to fund testing.

42:30.562 --> 42:33.764
Give us a couple words of
what your experience was.

42:33.765 --> 42:36.200
Just a few words... What really went on.

42:36.201 --> 42:39.937
They arranged for us to
be brought to a hotel.

42:39.938 --> 42:42.707
Travis, what did they take
from you while you were away?

42:42.708 --> 42:44.041
What did they look like?

42:44.042 --> 42:46.420
It was crazy. It was a madhouse.

42:46.421 --> 42:49.661
Anything at all, Travis.

42:49.703 --> 42:52.350
There was huge pressure for answers.

42:52.351 --> 42:54.719
Travis, how long were you there,
and what did they do to you?

42:54.720 --> 42:56.871
Tell us exactly.
The world is dying to know.

42:56.872 --> 43:01.825
I had no concept of the ramifications
of cooperating with them.

43:01.826 --> 43:04.194
The world wants to know tonight, Travis.

43:04.195 --> 43:05.888
Travis...

43:05.889 --> 43:09.026
I was so traumatized that I was basically,

43:09.027 --> 43:13.167
dealing with things inside of myself.

43:16.508 --> 43:19.243
I was at the mercy of some
pretty powerful forces

43:19.244 --> 43:21.979
that had nothing to do with what I needed.

43:21.980 --> 43:23.514
Just relax. You'll be okay.

43:23.515 --> 43:25.650
Just let the doctor talk
to you for a minute, okay?

43:25.651 --> 43:27.351
You'll be all right.

43:27.352 --> 43:32.632
I hadn't even told the
entire story to my brother.

43:34.526 --> 43:38.966
I just was so traumatized, I broke down.

43:41.700 --> 43:46.020
It was suggested that hypnosis be done.

43:47.289 --> 43:50.461
The purpose being to relate these details,

43:50.462 --> 43:52.810
without so much of this overpowering fear.

43:52.811 --> 43:58.711
Travis, I'm going to bring you
back to night of the forest.

44:13.898 --> 44:18.038
I didn't remember anything at first.

44:21.143 --> 44:25.223
I was just overpowered by the pain.

44:27.379 --> 44:30.739
It was so hot and humid.

44:31.883 --> 44:34.385
I could tell I was on some raised surface

44:34.386 --> 44:40.286
because of how close the ceiling
and the light above me were.

44:41.259 --> 44:44.061
I was struggling to breathe.

44:44.062 --> 44:46.096
What's going on here?

44:46.097 --> 44:49.337
What explains this pain?

44:53.216 --> 44:57.776
And there was this sort of curved thing...

44:57.952 --> 45:00.892
Down over my chest.

45:09.788 --> 45:14.451
I became aware of the sounds
of movement around me.

45:14.452 --> 45:17.572
People bustling around.

45:20.766 --> 45:24.310
I thought I was seeing doctors.

45:24.311 --> 45:29.471
Maybe somebody with a white
surgical mask and cap.

45:30.742 --> 45:36.642
I recalled getting out of the truck and
the crew when they were yelling at me.

45:37.348 --> 45:40.651
And I figured I must
have been hurt somehow.

45:40.652 --> 45:45.452
Maybe the crew had taken
me to the hospital.

45:48.026 --> 45:51.446
My vision abruptly cleared.

45:53.732 --> 45:57.212
I just totally flipped out.

46:15.326 --> 46:18.561
I was lying on my back looking up.

46:18.562 --> 46:23.433
I could see that there was sort of a
rectangular light fixture above me.

46:23.434 --> 46:28.371
You know, something gave me the
impression that I was in a hospital.

46:28.372 --> 46:32.209
I could make out these vague forms
that I thought to be doctors

46:32.210 --> 46:35.810
leaning close, looking at me.

46:39.616 --> 46:43.036
I struck out with my arm.

46:47.458 --> 46:51.958
The thing that was on my chest fell off.

46:54.698 --> 47:00.218
The fear gave me the strength
to be able to stand up.

47:03.341 --> 47:05.731
There was three of them...

47:05.732 --> 47:09.092
Small, four feet or less.

47:09.598 --> 47:12.389
Non-human but intelligent.

47:12.390 --> 47:15.810
Intelligent and unemotional.

47:20.657 --> 47:24.227
They were coming around
the table towards me.

47:24.228 --> 47:29.366
I bumped into this shelf, grabbed
the biggest thing there.

47:29.367 --> 47:31.134
Don't come any closer now!

47:31.135 --> 47:33.836
I started lashing out at them.

47:33.837 --> 47:37.437
Get away from me! Stay back!

47:37.650 --> 47:39.727
Don't come closer! Stay away!

47:39.728 --> 47:42.660
The fear was absolutely over the top.

47:42.661 --> 47:46.222
Stay back! Get away from me!
What do you want?

47:46.223 --> 47:49.019
Leave me alone! Stay back!

47:49.020 --> 47:51.492
Adrenaline was surging through me.

47:51.493 --> 47:53.810
Get away! Get away!

47:53.811 --> 47:56.451
Leave me alone!

47:56.593 --> 47:59.695
Get away! Leave me alone!

47:59.696 --> 48:03.116
They stopped out of reach.

48:03.500 --> 48:08.540
And all of a sudden, they
turned and just went.

48:12.543 --> 48:17.583
My immediate fear was that
they would come back.

48:28.225 --> 48:33.145
I looked to see if they
were still out there.

48:34.165 --> 48:39.685
They'd gone to the right,
and so I went to the left.

48:44.808 --> 48:49.079
As I moved down the passageway,
it was curving so tightly

48:49.080 --> 48:54.980
that I couldn't see behind me very
far to see if they were pursuing me.

48:58.055 --> 49:02.495
It was just this kind of blind hysteria.

49:05.886 --> 49:09.726
I was out of control with fear.

49:10.356 --> 49:15.036
Just thinking, I've got to find a way out.

49:16.173 --> 49:19.533
I came to the next door.

49:27.851 --> 49:32.771
This little room was empty
except for a chair.

49:36.520 --> 49:42.420
I thought there might be one of
those creatures sitting in it.

49:44.768 --> 49:50.668
I was feeling fear in every corner of
my mind and every inch of my body.

49:58.349 --> 50:02.818
When I got to the side, I could
see there was no one in it.

50:02.819 --> 50:08.699
That's when I felt safe enough
to move more into the room.

50:10.790 --> 50:16.690
I was thinking that I could open a
door, and it would lead outside.

50:22.139 --> 50:26.039
There was no doorknob, no button.

50:29.080 --> 50:32.248
There was buttons on the chair, and I
thought, well, if I push those buttons,

50:32.249 --> 50:35.609
maybe they open the door.

50:41.196 --> 50:43.995
When I moved into the room...

50:43.996 --> 50:49.336
It darkened, and I could see
little points of light.

50:57.741 --> 51:00.510
I sat in the chair.

51:00.511 --> 51:05.731
There was a degree of fear
about pushing a button.

51:11.522 --> 51:16.022
Most of them didn't seem to do anything.

51:16.360 --> 51:19.660
There was a lever there.

51:22.133 --> 51:26.393
It made all these stars move together.

51:35.822 --> 51:36.842
Hey.

51:36.843 --> 51:41.083
I turned, and there was a man
standing there in the doorway.

51:41.084 --> 51:44.820
I seized on the fact that this is
somebody that looks like a human being.

51:44.821 --> 51:47.190
Hey! Where are we?

51:47.191 --> 51:51.294
I thought maybe Air Force,
NASA, something like that.

51:51.295 --> 51:54.419
But there was something odd about the eyes.

51:54.420 --> 51:56.666
Help me, please! Please!

51:56.667 --> 51:59.735
Where are we? What's going on?

51:59.736 --> 52:01.804
What are those things?

52:01.805 --> 52:03.540
I was asking questions.

52:03.541 --> 52:04.807
Why aren't you talking to me?

52:04.808 --> 52:06.909
He didn't speak.

52:06.910 --> 52:08.444
Who are you?

52:08.445 --> 52:11.828
I thought maybe it's because of the
helmet preventing him from hearing.

52:11.829 --> 52:16.269
Why aren't you saying anything? Come on!

52:16.431 --> 52:18.435
He took me by the arm.

52:18.436 --> 52:20.890
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?

52:20.891 --> 52:22.758
I just thought that he
was there to save me.

52:22.759 --> 52:25.219
Who are you?

52:28.847 --> 52:34.747
I continued to try to talk to him, but I'd
kind of given up on getting an answer.

52:39.023 --> 52:42.743
He took me through some doors.

52:43.280 --> 52:47.717
Had to be a purpose to
step into this tiny space.

52:47.718 --> 52:51.198
Then the cool air came in.

52:55.025 --> 52:59.105
He wanted me to go down this ramp.

53:06.505 --> 53:10.420
I looked back, and I saw that
we had just come out of a craft

53:10.421 --> 53:13.901
like the one in the woods.

53:16.580 --> 53:21.800
My eyes were still adjusting
to the brighter light.

53:24.421 --> 53:30.321
I don't know if this was part of a larger
craft or, like, an airplane hangar.

53:31.795 --> 53:34.915
It really seemed huge.

53:37.601 --> 53:43.501
There was other craft in there, like
the disc-shaped craft we came out of.

53:44.841 --> 53:48.478
I didn't know where he was taking me.

53:48.479 --> 53:54.359
Not knowing is more terrifying
than the most explicit terror.

53:57.311 --> 53:59.722
He took me through some doors.

53:59.723 --> 54:03.563
There was a short hallway there.

54:08.465 --> 54:12.168
These three people were standing there.

54:12.169 --> 54:18.069
There was something about their eyes
that just seemed a little different.

54:20.311 --> 54:23.971
These were my rescuers, right?

54:24.881 --> 54:29.585
They were trying to get me
to lay down on this table.

54:29.586 --> 54:31.187
No, please. What are you doing?

54:31.188 --> 54:33.856
I started to get alarmed.

54:33.857 --> 54:36.693
What are they gonna do to me?
Why do they want me to lay on this table?

54:36.694 --> 54:38.794
No! No!

54:38.929 --> 54:43.429
All three of them were wrestling me down.

54:43.667 --> 54:47.927
Felt like I was fighting for my life.

55:05.247 --> 55:07.115
I was totally terrified.

55:07.116 --> 55:08.833
No! No!

55:08.834 --> 55:12.854
One of them had this plastic mask.

55:13.209 --> 55:19.109
I remember just getting my fingers under
the edge and trying to pull it away.

55:19.581 --> 55:22.281
And then just...

55:28.348 --> 55:32.548
That was the last thing I remembered.

55:41.383 --> 55:46.423
It was some time before
I saw any of the crew.

55:49.024 --> 55:52.564
We met up at Mike's house.

55:58.099 --> 56:00.859
He was different.

56:04.683 --> 56:07.923
Didn't act like Travis.

56:08.634 --> 56:12.054
He looked pretty shook up.

56:13.606 --> 56:16.841
He still had a great amount
of fear in his eyes.

56:16.842 --> 56:19.362
Are you okay?

56:25.517 --> 56:28.037
What happened?

56:28.887 --> 56:32.022
The details are still quite foggy.

56:32.023 --> 56:35.493
The story Travis told was really bizarre.

56:35.494 --> 56:39.274
I remember being in the forest.

56:43.869 --> 56:46.569
Hard to believe.

56:47.392 --> 56:50.692
But he was very sincere.

56:55.021 --> 56:58.861
What would I do but believe it?

57:00.739 --> 57:06.639
Soon as he told me, I believed
it because I saw the first part.

57:09.395 --> 57:12.268
Didn't think any way that a 22-year-old man

57:12.269 --> 57:15.949
could be knocked to the ground
like that and just shake it off

57:15.950 --> 57:20.871
and hide and think up some
story to tell people.

57:20.872 --> 57:23.330
I didn't have any problem at all with it.

57:23.331 --> 57:28.671
I'd known him for years.
I knew he wasn't a liar.

57:29.881 --> 57:35.461
They were dealing with the
same kind of things I was...

57:35.721 --> 57:38.601
Ridicule, suspicion.

57:41.794 --> 57:47.465
People were desperate to explain
this away any way they could.

57:47.466 --> 57:53.366
One theory said that Mike or my brother
or me hung up papier-mache in a tree.

57:54.822 --> 57:57.337
I'm not even going there.
That's just ridiculous.

57:57.338 --> 57:59.610
A model hanging in the tree?

57:59.611 --> 58:02.880
I've sat and thought it
over many, many times,

58:02.881 --> 58:07.352
hoping it would be something like
that, but it was not possible.

58:07.353 --> 58:11.121
They just saw a ball of lightning.

58:11.122 --> 58:14.191
There's no doubt in my mind of what I saw.

58:14.192 --> 58:16.494
I could see the framework of this thing.

58:16.495 --> 58:22.266
Some people said this was some kind
of a drug hallucination or psychosis.

58:22.267 --> 58:25.970
There was no evidence for any
drugs in his urine or blood,

58:25.971 --> 58:29.571
no evidence of any psychosis.

58:29.899 --> 58:34.879
If it was a hoax, why
delay it for five days?

58:35.479 --> 58:39.195
The law enforcement come up with the
idea that maybe the crew had hit

58:39.196 --> 58:45.096
me on the head, slipped me drugs,
and then made up the whole story.

58:46.193 --> 58:49.757
No, there might have been a couple
of times I wanted to hit him, but...

58:49.758 --> 58:52.697
We didn't. None of us did that, no.

58:52.698 --> 58:55.366
I think they just decided
that there was a way

58:55.367 --> 58:59.203
that they could tell this
story and get in the news.

58:59.204 --> 59:02.619
Who's gonna come into
town and tell a story...

59:02.620 --> 59:06.677
That we know half the population
isn't gonna believe anyway?

59:06.678 --> 59:11.315
I felt the law enforcement
was the victim of a fraud.

59:11.316 --> 59:13.017
I need to report a missing person.

59:13.018 --> 59:17.818
I think they used us to
enhance their story.

59:18.223 --> 59:22.252
I think Travis was hid out
somewhere out there and...

59:22.253 --> 59:27.653
Did a good job of hiding out,
because we didn't find him.

59:27.654 --> 59:30.749
Travis wasn't hiding.
We didn't make the story up.

59:30.750 --> 59:33.754
He didn't make the story up.
It was all for real.

59:33.755 --> 59:37.295
Terrifying, but it was real.

59:41.513 --> 59:45.316
We basically went our separate ways.

59:45.317 --> 59:50.117
All of us experienced a
life-changing trauma.

59:52.023 --> 59:55.159
It had a profound effect on my life.

59:55.160 --> 59:58.896
I kind of took off and went
kind of wild for a while.

59:58.897 --> 01:00:01.699
I didn't like being called a liar.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.836
I didn't want people knowing
about it, so I left the area.

01:00:04.837 --> 01:00:09.143
And for years, I never talked about it.

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:14.244
It was the most horrifying
experience of my life.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.819
It was hard to come to terms with.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:23.611
I got two brothers that don't believe
me, and my mom don't believe me.

01:00:23.612 --> 01:00:29.512
That's the hard part. You tell the
truth, and people think you're lying.

01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:33.898
I left Arizona and didn't come back.

01:00:34.368 --> 01:00:36.567
It was an extremely hard
thing to go through,

01:00:36.568 --> 01:00:41.908
and it's been very hard to
remember over the years.

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:49.257
I had nightmares and...

01:00:58.024 --> 01:01:00.787
For a couple of weeks after that I was...

01:01:00.788 --> 01:01:02.888
Like a little kid...

01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:05.829
Afraid of the dark.

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:13.735
I was afraid to look out the window.

01:01:14.185 --> 01:01:18.445
I mean, for a guy of 25 years old...

01:01:18.778 --> 01:01:23.638
Being afraid you were
gonna see a spaceship...

01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:27.785
Is something that I haven't gotten over.

01:01:27.786 --> 01:01:30.486
I wish I could.

01:01:43.702 --> 01:01:49.462
I know that Mike felt some guilt
about having driven away.

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:53.550
Maybe there was some recriminations.

01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:59.795
That experience is still inexplicable.

01:01:59.796 --> 01:02:02.856
It's still bothering.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:13.837
I'm 100% sure of what happened to me.

01:02:15.389 --> 01:02:18.689
I tested Travis in 1993.

01:02:20.561 --> 01:02:22.971
Travis was not lying.

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:26.866
It did happen as he said it did.

01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:29.202
Exactly as it said it did...

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:32.452
Because the questions
were made specifically

01:02:32.453 --> 01:02:36.653
on facts that he claimed to be true.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.551
It does surprise me that
they've stuck to the story.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:48.988
Someday I would like to get the real story.

01:02:48.989 --> 01:02:52.889
Just for my personal satisfaction.

01:02:56.556 --> 01:02:59.640
I wish I had never gotten
out of that truck.

01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:03.301
I'd rather it never happened.

01:03:03.584 --> 01:03:07.904
Those who doubt will continue to doubt.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.120
If people don't want to believe
it, that's their problem.

01:03:16.327 --> 01:03:20.167
So I'm kind of left with that.
