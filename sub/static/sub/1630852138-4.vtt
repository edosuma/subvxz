00:19.600 --> 00:20.600
Kee-Ko?

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Where are you?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.160
Kee-Ko?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.040
Kee-Ko?

00:42.040 --> 00:43.200
Please answer me.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.640
Where are you?

01:54.600 --> 01:55.640
Jose?

01:57.280 --> 01:58.440
Where the hell is she?

01:58.960 --> 02:02.200
Kasper? What did you do up here?

02:04.640 --> 02:05.960
What kind of animal was it?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.560
I'm from the city. How would I know?

02:10.680 --> 02:15.160
All that stuff about reading at home
and the scratch on her hand was a lie?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.160
Yes.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.960
Mom, don't do that, okay?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.840
What the hell is that? Is that a cat?

02:22.360 --> 02:24.080
Who did this?

02:25.640 --> 02:26.560
Kasper!

02:27.280 --> 02:28.320
The animal did.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.960
Jose wanted to help it
because we hit it with the car.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.920
If the animal ran back to the fence,
maybe she followed it.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.480
-She's afraid it can't make it alone.
-We have to get to the fence.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.400
What animal was it? Don't lie.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.880
Was it a fox or a bear cub? What was it?

02:50.840 --> 02:51.960
It was an elf.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.120
An elf?

02:58.040 --> 03:00.880
Liv says there are elves in the forest.
Dangerous elves.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.360
Nice one, Kasper.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.440
Great comedic timing.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.600
It's not pretty.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.040
No.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.640
What are they hiding
behind that massive fence?

03:34.560 --> 03:35.800
What did Karen say?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.520
Toxic waste?

03:37.600 --> 03:41.360
You don't enclose toxic ground.
It makes no sense.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.440
Jose!

03:47.200 --> 03:48.240
Jose!

03:51.040 --> 03:52.880
She drives me crazy. Where is she?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.240
-Mom?
-We'll find her.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.320
-Yes?
-Her bike's over there.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.480
Where is she?
Could she have gone in there?

04:06.960 --> 04:09.760
That's an electric fence
and barbed wire, so no.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.200
You know what she's like.
She can get in anywhere.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.520
I just need to know
if she's behind that fence.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.240
We'll find her. Okay?

04:20.320 --> 04:23.400
Kasper, go to Karen.
Tell her we need a key.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.560
-We need to check if Josefine's in there.
-On this thing?

04:26.640 --> 04:28.360
No, Kasper. Take the car.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.160
Go on. Hurry up.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.120
-We'll find her, honey.
-Yes.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.600
-Okay?
-Sure.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.640
Kee-Ko?

04:54.880 --> 04:55.880
Come on.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.880
Kee-Ko?

07:58.280 --> 07:59.320
Mads.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.880
I'm glad you came.
We really need your help.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.680
We think our daughter is in there,
so we need to get in.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.640
The gate's locked. You need to go.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.680
Was it locked all day?
Could she have snuck in?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.760
Our daughter is quite the adventurer.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.440
She likes to explore,
so maybe she went in there.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.000
Our son thinks
she's looking for an animal.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.160
Hello?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.160
-We need to get in.
-Go back to the house.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.560
We need to get in now
to find our daughter!

08:39.640 --> 08:41.080
Go back to the house.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.520
Open that gate! Now!

08:48.600 --> 08:49.640
All right, then.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.400
-I'll do it myself.
-Ridiculous.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.800
I'll disconnect the power.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.960
Then I'll climb over the fence.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.720
What the hell are you doing? Mads!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.040
Hey!

09:12.120 --> 09:13.720
Please don't shoot!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.880
Hello? Is anybody there?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.880
Liv, we need help.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.520
Liv.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.200
What's up?

09:30.280 --> 09:33.320
We need the key for the fence.
I think Josefine is in there.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.080
Why do you think so?

09:36.800 --> 09:37.840
She was…

09:39.040 --> 09:42.600
She was hiding an animal in the barn.
I think she followed it into the forest.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.480
It's blocked off with an electric fence.
The gate's locked.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.880
-You can't get in.
-The bike was by the fence.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.320
She's probably just hiding.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.640
Grandma, can't we help them?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
Karen, what if she's in there?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.440
Then she can't get back out.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.640
There's nothing I can do for you.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.440
Liv…

10:01.520 --> 10:03.400
-I think you need to leave.
-Karen!

10:03.480 --> 10:05.480
You have got to help me.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.680
This is crazy, man!

10:12.400 --> 10:13.880
She's just a little girl.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.160
She's old enough
to be responsible for her actions.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.680
-I can't…
-We'll drive to Karen's.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.120
-I can't leave.
-Let's go!

11:57.200 --> 11:59.280
-Now!
-Give us two seconds.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.160
-We have to stay.
-We'll fix it. Relax. We must…

12:02.240 --> 12:03.080
Let's go.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.400
Or what? Or you'll shoot us?

12:05.480 --> 12:08.400
We have to find out
if our daughter's in there.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.680
Do you understand?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.960
Imagine if it were your child.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.880
You need to open the gate.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.000
Please open the gate now.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.480
Please open the gate?

12:30.920 --> 12:31.800
I can't.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.040
I wish I could.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.720
But there are things here
you don't understand.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.440
Take his keys.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.680
Let go!

13:50.760 --> 13:52.080
Don't open the gate!

13:52.760 --> 13:55.480
-They can't get out.
-They?

13:55.560 --> 13:56.880
Who are they?

14:02.720 --> 14:04.720
We need to get the power back on!

14:09.120 --> 14:10.160
I'm begging you.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.520
Don't open it.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.360
Jose?

14:50.840 --> 14:51.760
What about Karen?

14:52.880 --> 14:53.960
Just come on.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.360
Kee-Ko!

15:47.480 --> 15:50.160
I came to help set you free…

15:51.960 --> 15:53.800
but I can't find my way out.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.280
Can you help me?

15:57.440 --> 16:00.640
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I can't find my way out.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.880
No. Wait!

16:04.960 --> 16:07.200
No, don't go.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.760
No.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.600
That way?

16:14.480 --> 16:15.680
Is it that way?

16:30.480 --> 16:31.600
Josefine!

16:32.400 --> 16:34.280
Mom, I'm over here!

16:34.920 --> 16:38.160
-Josefine! Where are you?
-Here!

16:40.120 --> 16:40.960
Come on.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.480
She won't hurt you. It's just my mom.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
-Josefine!
-Come on.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.360
Mom, I'm here!

16:46.440 --> 16:47.760
Over here, Mom!

16:49.240 --> 16:50.960
-Josefine!
-Just come on.

16:51.040 --> 16:51.880
Come on.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.120
Come on, she's not dangerous.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.200
Where were you? We were looking for you.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.680
We were looking for you. Where were you?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.960
What is that?

17:04.040 --> 17:06.800
What the hell is that? Get away!

17:06.880 --> 17:08.080
Stop! What are you doing?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.120
Run, I said!

17:09.200 --> 17:10.880
-It's my friend.
-Come on, Jose.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.640
-He didn't do anything.
-Jose, we need to go!

17:13.720 --> 17:16.080
-Do you understand? Come on!
-Stop it. No!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.120
-Come on!
-It's coming too.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.160
I've had enough!

17:19.240 --> 17:21.960
-Come on!
-Mom, I want it to come too. Stop!

17:27.040 --> 17:28.320
Stay where you are.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.040
-You don't know what you're messing with.
-Never mind. You're staying there.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.720
Mom, I want it to come too.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.120
-It can't be in there.
-Everything okay?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.600
-Stop.
-Enough now!

17:37.680 --> 17:39.680
-Wait.
-Honey, don't argue with me.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
-Come on.
-Are you okay?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.200
-Stop.
-Let's get out.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.400
Are you okay?

17:45.280 --> 17:47.120
They're coming. Get out!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.280
It's coming too.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.360
-Get out now!
-What is that?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.520
-What the hell is that?
-Out!

17:57.080 --> 17:58.480
-What is it?
-Take the car.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.520
You come in the truck with me. Come on.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.600
