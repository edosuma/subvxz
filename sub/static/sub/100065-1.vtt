WEBVTT

00:09.574 --> 00:11.054
She was picked up

00:11.098 --> 00:12.838
on narcotics and
weapons possession

00:12.882 --> 00:15.232
outside a nightclub
about 2:30 this morning.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.321
She played your
courtesy card

00:17.365 --> 00:19.323
to the arresting
officer on the scene.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.586
She also mention

00:21.630 --> 00:25.373
how someone I've never heard of has
my courtesy card?

00:25.416 --> 00:28.028
Says she got it
from her dad.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.118
And that'swhy I'm here?

00:31.161 --> 00:34.512
That's exactly why, boss.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:43.173 --> 00:45.088
Morning, Frankie.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.615
Morning, Lenny.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.671
You got a kid?

01:02.714 --> 01:05.978
Yes. A good kid
who made a bad choice.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.328
Oh, we'll get to that.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.243
Her mother was a waitress
at that Greek joint.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.115
You remember, across from
the boardwalk in Coney Island.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.769
Melina, with the little rose

01:13.812 --> 01:15.814
tattooed on her wrist
and the big red heart on her...

01:15.858 --> 01:18.078
Anyway, she's got
her mother's looks, thank God,

01:18.121 --> 01:19.296
and when she decided

01:19.340 --> 01:20.732
to move up here, I...

01:20.776 --> 01:22.865
I lent her the courtesy card
just in case.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.562
Just in case she got picked up

01:24.606 --> 01:27.304
on narcotics
and weapons charges?

01:27.348 --> 01:29.828
She was holding the stuff
for a friend.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.091
Oh.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.657
Well, if you put it that way.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.529
Frank, I swear,
she's a good kid.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.835
Said every father
of every kid

01:36.879 --> 01:38.620
who got in a jam, ever.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.448
No courtesy card

01:40.491 --> 01:43.146
skates a felony charge, ever.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.539
Not even mine.

01:44.582 --> 01:45.670
So what are you saying?

01:45.714 --> 01:47.672
I...

01:47.716 --> 01:50.153
I guess my next call
is to the D.A., but...

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
I can't promise anything.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.330
That's all you got?

01:53.374 --> 01:55.071
That's all I got right now,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.334
as you know full well.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.423
So put the violin away.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.035
Let's get some breakfast.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.168
Ms. Wright?

02:05.212 --> 02:07.214
I'm Assistant District
Attorney Erin Reagan.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.824
I know you've already

02:08.866 --> 02:12.044
spoken to detectives, but
I have a few questions, okay?

02:13.350 --> 02:14.786
Did you see your attacker?

02:14.830 --> 02:16.875
Anything
distinctive about

02:16.919 --> 02:19.791
his voice, or physically,
like his skin color?

02:19.835 --> 02:22.054
He was wearing, um, a mask.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.579
I didn't see his face.

02:24.622 --> 02:25.884
Stop it! Olivia!OFFICER: Sir...

02:25.928 --> 02:26.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:26.972 --> 02:28.322
I told you
you can't go in there.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.845
I'm gonna have to cuff you.I just want to make sure

02:29.888 --> 02:30.759
you're okay. You're...
Are you okay?Get out of here.

02:30.802 --> 02:31.890
Olivia?

02:31.934 --> 02:33.327
Come on, open the door.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.155
Everything's gonna be okay,
all right? I'll be back.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.203
What the hell was that about?

02:40.247 --> 02:41.552
I just need to know
if she's okay.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.640
Who the hell is this?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.076
This is John Spencer,

02:44.120 --> 02:45.817
Olivia Wright's boyfriend.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.080
I-I just want to
see my girlfriend.Well, the best thing

02:48.124 --> 02:49.734
you can do for her
is to calm down.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.388
Help us find out
who did this to her.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.477
I explained we'd
like him to come down

02:53.521 --> 02:55.175
to the precinct
with the detectives

02:55.218 --> 02:56.872
to answer
some questions.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.917
What happened to your hand?

02:58.961 --> 03:00.919
I, uh... I hurt it...

03:00.963 --> 03:02.225
playing basketball.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
Don't answer

03:04.271 --> 03:06.098
any questions.

03:06.142 --> 03:09.145
The almighty Erin Reagan.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.407
You called your lawyer.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.930
Is my client
under arrest?

03:11.974 --> 03:13.236
No, but we do have
some questions.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.368
No questions.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.021
And who the hell are you?

03:16.065 --> 03:18.720
High-priced defense attorney for
guilty people with deep pockets.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.112
Glad to see you're
still living up

03:20.156 --> 03:22.245
to your reputation
of being a huge bitch.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.334
Hey... watch.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.207
Give me a call if you want
to talk to my client.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.512
Let's go.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.824
Bring it.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.263
Hey, boss.Hi.
What--

03:40.307 --> 03:41.960
honeymoon's over already?

03:42.004 --> 03:44.398
Oh, we're not reporting
for duty yet, boss.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.790
We-we wanted to get
ahead of something.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.010
Staying put in the 2-9.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.141
Yes, sir.
We know it's customary

03:49.185 --> 03:51.231
to separate
married officers.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.276
But not an actual rule.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.279
And SergeantReagan has been
getting a lot of traction.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.499
And Officer Janko-Reagan
is a real asset.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.631
Janko-Reagan--
kind of a mouthful.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.546
We're just trying it out, sir.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.722
Is this you,
or is One PP in the loop?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.811
No, sir. Just us.
Looking for apartments,

04:06.855 --> 04:09.597
so we need to know what precinct
or precincts we'll be working.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.296
I can move Officer Janko-Reagan

04:13.340 --> 04:15.646
to Sergeant McNichols' squad.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.474
Midnight?That's all I've got

04:17.517 --> 04:19.476
unless we move
someone else to nights

04:19.519 --> 04:22.436
on account of your... your
last name includes "Reagan."

04:22.479 --> 04:23.480
I wouldn't want that.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.873
I'd hope not.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.313
Call her.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315
She's a real estate agent.
She respects the job.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.316
She's all you'll need.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.275
Nights or new house?

04:35.318 --> 04:36.711
Let me know ASAP.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.495
Thank you, boss.

04:38.539 --> 04:39.844
Thank you.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.020
You gonna tell me
what we're doing here?

04:42.064 --> 04:44.414
You know Maggie,
the, uh... the medium--

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
she said she wanted
to meet here.

04:46.373 --> 04:49.245
Uh-huh. She still
talking to dead people?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.507
Come on.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.553
Well, I thought you
were the skeptical one.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.381
And I thought
you were the believer.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.686
She said she had
some information

04:55.730 --> 04:56.774
about a case we're working.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.515
What do you want me to do?What case?

04:58.559 --> 04:59.908
I don't know.
She didn't say.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.344
And you don't
find that odd?

05:01.388 --> 05:03.390
I find a lot of things
about her odd,

05:03.433 --> 05:05.870
but she helped before,
so maybe she'll help again.MAGGIE: Hi!

05:05.914 --> 05:07.524
Hey, hey, hey. Hi!

05:07.568 --> 05:10.222
Hey! Come on.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.008
But... Ugh. Be careful.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.141
Just come on.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.970
Adam Miller, this is

05:19.014 --> 05:21.059
Detective Reagan
and Detective Baez.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.758
You mind telling us
what's going on here?

05:23.801 --> 05:26.064
Well, Adam's daughter Emily--

05:26.108 --> 05:27.892
uh, she disappeared last year.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.286
We don't do
missing persons.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.592
Two weeks later,

05:31.635 --> 05:33.289
she was found murdered.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.292
They found my baby
right here, Detectives.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.642
Um, can we have a word
in private?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.644
Come on, Maggie.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.951
What the hell
is going on here?What?

05:42.994 --> 05:43.995
It's not even our case.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.997
Yeah, but it could be.We can't

05:46.041 --> 05:47.695
go running around playing
with people's emotions.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.044
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.785
I am not playing
with his emotions.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.134
I want to help him.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.092
And I went to the detective.
And, trust me,

05:54.136 --> 05:57.444
he is going
in the wrong direction.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.405
I know this is a little
out of the ordinary. Uh...

06:02.449 --> 06:03.972
Either of you have kids?

06:04.015 --> 06:06.540
Yeah.They found my daughter here

06:06.583 --> 06:08.193
on this spot last July,
and I'm no closer

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
to finding out what happened
or who killed her.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.763
I just need

06:12.807 --> 06:14.809
someone to help me.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.770
Really?

06:49.539 --> 06:51.236
Of course I checked it
all out. The paperwork

06:51.280 --> 06:54.239
was legit, the DNA matched.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.807
And there were tons of, uh,
details and time lines that

06:56.851 --> 06:58.809
she only could have
gotten from Melina.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.028
So you took her in.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.986
Of course I took her in.
She's my daughter.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.380
You, of all people,
should know that.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.469
Hey, I meant it as a compliment.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.037
Oh. Sorry.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.735
Anyway, I taught her
tarpon and bonefishing,

07:11.779 --> 07:13.955
which she took to like
she was born to it.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.174
Gave her a job at
one of my restaurants.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.785
She's got a pretty
good work ethic.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.787
I'm not interviewing her
for a job here.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.528
I know. I'm just...
I'm just saying

07:21.571 --> 07:22.790
that we all make mistakes.

07:26.228 --> 07:30.145
This isn't her first
brush with the law, is it?

07:32.103 --> 07:33.496
One of my managers found out

07:33.540 --> 07:36.064
that Carrie had
figured out a system

07:36.107 --> 07:37.631
for skimming from the till.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.589
Hmm?He brought it to me

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
instead of the
cops, of course.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.114
Okay.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.116
And I gave her
a second chance.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.249
And a third and a fourth.Hey, hey.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.425
You got to show 'em
that life doesn't come

07:49.469 --> 07:51.993
with safety nets included.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.823
About six months ago,

07:55.866 --> 07:57.955
she told me she was
missing seasonal change

07:57.999 --> 07:59.914
and wanted to come back
up north for a while.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.614
Lenny, how come you never
told me you have a daughter?

08:04.658 --> 08:07.487
I just figured it'd come
off as another screwup.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.968
You really think
that little of me?

08:11.012 --> 08:13.101
No. No, Frank,
just the opposite.

08:14.885 --> 08:19.063
You raised four kids from
the day they were born

08:19.107 --> 08:21.979
in your image,
with your values.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.985
Mine rolled up on me
one night in a taxicab,

08:28.029 --> 08:30.640
already 21 and fully formed.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.037
Did you put in

08:36.080 --> 08:38.256
a request to run DNA
in the Miller case

08:38.299 --> 08:40.215
through every state's
local database?

08:40.258 --> 08:41.912
Well, all the DNA
that was found

08:41.956 --> 08:44.436
on Emily Miller's body didn't
match anyone in the system,

08:44.480 --> 08:47.614
so I thought maybe something
will pop somewhere else.

08:47.657 --> 08:48.963
So we're taking
the case over?

08:49.006 --> 08:50.617
We're not taking
the case over.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.619
We're... we're going
through the motions, see?

08:52.662 --> 08:55.099
So that way, we can tell,
uh, Maggie and Mr. Miller

08:55.143 --> 08:56.536
that we at least tried.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.841
Are you kidding me?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.147
Look, are you pissed off
at me about something?

08:59.190 --> 09:00.801
Well, it would be nice
to be consulted

09:00.844 --> 09:03.281
when we take a case over that's
gonna piss off the entire squad,

09:03.325 --> 09:05.588
not to mention
the detective assigned to it.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.590
Yeah. Well...

09:09.461 --> 09:11.420
I got good news
and bad news.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.943
Well, I hope the good news

09:12.987 --> 09:15.076
is that John Spencer
got a new lawyer.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
Ah, she's all talk.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.254
Sandra Colby hasn't
lost a case in two years.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.865
She's a very good lawyer.And so are you.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.781
And I've never known you
to shy away from a good fight.

09:24.825 --> 09:28.916
I'm not... but I am wondering

09:28.959 --> 09:31.788
how much of what she said
is true.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.877
Which part?

09:36.663 --> 09:40.231
Do I have a reputation
for being a bitch?

09:42.451 --> 09:44.105
Look,

09:44.148 --> 09:45.802
I'm an in-your-face
kind of guy.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.369
I don't back down.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.415
And-and I don't let go
of a case, uh, uh, until

09:50.459 --> 09:52.113
I've worked out
every angle,

09:52.156 --> 09:54.115
no matter how many
people I piss off,

09:54.158 --> 09:57.161
and you know I piss
people off all day long.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.815
Okay.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.556
Does anyone call me a "bitch"?

10:00.600 --> 10:04.125
No. They say, "This guy's
great. He's got balls."

10:05.169 --> 10:07.128
So I guess the answer's "yes."

10:07.171 --> 10:08.651
All right,

10:08.695 --> 10:10.000
so give me the good news.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.524
First of all, this
guy Spencer, uh--

10:12.568 --> 10:15.484
he's been collared for assault
before, all on young women.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.400
They all dropped the charges
before it went to trial.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.967
I can't use prior acts
of violence

10:20.010 --> 10:22.012
against other women at trial.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.275
I found video of Olivia
being thrown out of a car.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.668
Terrific.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.148
But the license plates
aren't legible.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.715
Make and model?

10:28.758 --> 10:30.847
Yeah, they match Spencer's
gray BMW,

10:30.891 --> 10:33.720
but without the plates,
it won't be of any help to us.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.460
Olivia doesn't know that.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.245
And a roof deck

10:37.288 --> 10:41.205
health club with SoulCycle
classes, 24-hour doormen

10:41.249 --> 10:43.947
and...
onsite parking.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.689
Sergeant, what do you think?I'm sure

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
we could afford it if we
were in, say, Topeka, Kansas.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.953
No, that's not nec...

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
Which we are not.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.609
Jamie.WOMAN:
Guys, this unit

10:53.653 --> 10:56.177
is $1,500 a month, but...

10:56.220 --> 10:58.005
Which is ridiculously low.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.746
As I explained,

10:59.789 --> 11:02.139
these are new buildings,

11:02.183 --> 11:04.185
ground-floor opportunities.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.100
Being as you two

11:06.143 --> 11:08.493
are the exact kind of couple
that the developers are looking

11:08.537 --> 11:10.060
to attract,

11:10.104 --> 11:11.627
there are significant
enticements

11:11.671 --> 11:13.281
on the initial two-year lease.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.283
Well, that makes sense.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.025
Well, discounts
'cause we're cops, right?

11:18.068 --> 11:22.333
It's a little more complicated
than just being cops.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.988
Well, we're not just
any cops, we're the son

11:25.032 --> 11:27.077
and daughter-in-law
of the police commissioner,

11:27.121 --> 11:29.079
which means anywhere
that we rent

11:29.123 --> 11:31.081
automatically becomes
one of the safest buildings

11:31.125 --> 11:32.735
on the safest blocks
in the city.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.391
A little friendly advice,

11:36.434 --> 11:39.176
from a woman
who has been married twice,

11:39.220 --> 11:43.137
it's hard enough without looking
gift horses in their mouths.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.574
I bet that's true.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.794
But not for us.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.667
But thank you.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.325
Ah, okay.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.328
I kept it exactly
the way she left it.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.939
Okay.
We'll take it from here.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.900
So, y-you know she
wasn't killed here.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.640
We are aware of
that fact, yes.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.903
U-Um...

12:09.946 --> 12:11.426
I've been seeing paintings.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.036
Like a-a-an art studio

12:13.080 --> 12:16.170
and she was
killed near water,

12:16.213 --> 12:17.519
a-a body of water.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.174
We're in New York City,
we're surrounded by water.

12:20.217 --> 12:22.437
You are aware of the fact
that Mr. Miller

12:22.480 --> 12:24.961
is a person of interest, right?

12:25.005 --> 12:26.397
He didn't do it.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.878
Great. We'll just
take your word for it.

12:32.447 --> 12:36.016
Do you think that it is easy

12:36.059 --> 12:37.669
for me to connect with a kid

12:37.713 --> 12:40.020
who has been violently murdered?

12:40.063 --> 12:43.284
And-and then relay
those messages to her father?

12:43.327 --> 12:47.462
Do you think that it is
easy to ask you for help?

12:47.505 --> 12:50.813
I don't know what it's like
for you at all.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.380
But I also know
that I don't like

12:52.423 --> 12:54.338
the direction
this is heading right now.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.993
You know what?
I don't need your help.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.343
I am so sorry
to have bothered you.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.520
Danny, DNA came back.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.261
Great, do we got a match?

13:04.305 --> 13:06.481
Not to a suspect,
but to two other victims.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.178
One in Pennsylvania,
one in New Jersey.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.919
Plus, Emily Miller.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.835
So the son of a bitch
murdered three little girls.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.453
The arresting officer
amended his narrative

13:22.497 --> 13:23.846
in the online booking report.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.891
Said she was less
than cooperative,

13:24.934 --> 13:26.414
a lot of lip
and attitude,

13:26.457 --> 13:27.894
even before she
played your card.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.158
Why'd they amend?

13:31.201 --> 13:35.118
Because I told him that PC
wanted a straight-up account

13:35.162 --> 13:37.555
of what went done;
never mind the connections.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.210
What else?

13:40.254 --> 13:41.255
There was a hive of paparazzi

13:41.298 --> 13:42.560
outside the club
when it happened.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.041
They got the arrest
on tape and audio.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.608
So some girl gets busted

13:46.651 --> 13:48.349
outside a club,
happens all the time.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.264
Oh, not just some girl.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.222
Lenny Ross's daughter.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.094
And, as you well know,
the press corps

13:54.137 --> 13:56.313
has had it out for Lenny
since The New Yorkerhad

13:56.357 --> 13:59.360
to pull that story 'cause
he fed 'em a load of crap.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.884
So if the D.A.
tamps down the charges,

14:01.928 --> 14:03.364
it's gonna get covered.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.757
And you're gonna
get covered in guano.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.109
Boss, if I may,
I know Lenny's an old pal...

14:09.152 --> 14:10.545
Partner.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.286
Right.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.288
I'm just saying, at what point

14:14.331 --> 14:17.378
are you no longer responsible
when he brings trouble?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.162
I don't know, Sid.
You got some kind of graph

14:19.206 --> 14:20.598
you can show me?

14:20.642 --> 14:22.122
All we have on
Carrie Ross

14:22.165 --> 14:23.819
from when she was
Carrie Manikas

14:23.863 --> 14:27.127
from Nassau County and
Dade County, Florida.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.391
Sid's right, Frank.

14:30.434 --> 14:33.829
Where are you going with this
that isn't just more trouble?

14:33.873 --> 14:37.137
That's unknowable, Slim.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.140
There's only one thing for sure
when Lenny Ross shows up,

14:40.183 --> 14:43.883
and that's that
nothing is for sure.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.505
He's not here.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.247
Okay. Uh...

15:00.290 --> 15:03.163
Do you remember
that I mentioned an art studio?

15:03.206 --> 15:05.121
I believe that the killer

15:05.165 --> 15:07.428
is luring his victims
by using them

15:07.471 --> 15:09.212
as subjects for paintings.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.911
Okay.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.000
I'll pass that on.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.089
Thank you.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.401
You know, maybe you should
just leave him alone.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.750
Excuse me?

15:25.794 --> 15:28.753
He doesn't need you
disrupting his life anymore.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.886
I'm not trying
to disrupt his life.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.366
Oh, no?

15:32.409 --> 15:34.324
Getting him to
take his ring off,

15:34.368 --> 15:36.152
asking him for help on cases,

15:36.196 --> 15:38.067
that's not disrupting his life?

15:38.111 --> 15:39.416
I wanted to help him move on.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.202
Maybe you need to back off.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.769
I don't have any
ulterior motives here,

15:44.813 --> 15:46.641
other than giving
a father some peace,

15:46.684 --> 15:48.425
and catching a killer.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.428
Why are you doing this?
You're not a cop.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.478
I had a daughter
that was murdered in college,

15:57.521 --> 16:02.048
and it's taken me years
to learn to live again.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.746
And the way that I did that,

16:04.789 --> 16:07.444
was by giving back to others.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.230
I know that you're
just trying to protect

16:10.273 --> 16:12.319
your partner,
but you certainly don't need

16:12.362 --> 16:14.669
to protect him from me.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.632
You said that you didn't see
your attacker?

16:21.676 --> 16:23.721
That's right.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.376
Do you know how many cameras
there are all around this city?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.508
What does that
have to do with me?

16:27.551 --> 16:28.726
Let me show you.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.211
Now, we both know
whose car that is.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.821
I can explain.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.041
I'd love to know
how a woman, eh,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.825
could defend a guy
who beats her up.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.305
It's not that simple.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.741
I have
a ten-year-old daughter.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.178
You know what I always tell her?

16:45.221 --> 16:47.789
I tell her that the single
most important decision

16:47.832 --> 16:49.269
she's ever gonna make

16:49.312 --> 16:51.923
is who she decides
to spend her life with.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.709
You want to spend your life
with this guy?

16:54.752 --> 16:57.886
He's given me a nice lifestyle,

16:57.929 --> 17:01.020
a beautiful apartment,
a good job.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.282
You know another thing
I always tell my daughter?

17:02.325 --> 17:05.807
Never let anyone disrespect you.

17:05.849 --> 17:07.461
What do you want from me?

17:07.503 --> 17:09.028
You have the power
to put this guy away

17:09.070 --> 17:12.074
right here, right now,
with the truth.

17:12.117 --> 17:15.034
Don't let him get away
with this again.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.781
I sure do appreciate you taking
the time, Commissioner.

17:23.825 --> 17:27.046
My dad does, too.
I'm sure you know.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.006
Well, Lenny and me,
we've been that way since,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.878
well, since we were
about your age.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.402
Mm.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.187
In each others' corners
come hell or high water.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.754
So he's told me.

17:39.797 --> 17:43.671
Ah. Something else
I bet he's told you...

17:43.714 --> 17:47.718
courtesy given gets
courtesy in return.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.895
Sure. Anything.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.072
You name it.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.032
The truth.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.644
I am telling you the truth.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.261
Okay.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
If you don't mind,
I'm not done with that.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.179
Oh, sure you are.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.530
See, a lab can swab
the DNA off of that

18:16.573 --> 18:20.534
and get me the results tonight,
so...

18:20.577 --> 18:22.971
You have to ask yourself,

18:23.014 --> 18:25.104
"How good's my bluff?"

18:25.147 --> 18:27.671
'Cause I'm calling it.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.722
I think I'd like a lawyer.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.377
You could do that,

18:37.420 --> 18:40.336
as you seem to already know.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.166
But my courtesy...
can turn into something

18:44.210 --> 18:46.995
I think you'd really
rather avoid.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.175
How's this?

18:53.219 --> 18:56.135
Your mom told you
about her and Lenny,

18:56.178 --> 18:58.441
so you looked Lenny up,

18:58.485 --> 19:01.183
found out he was
a successful businessman,

19:01.227 --> 19:04.055
no kids,
nice Florida lifestyle,

19:04.099 --> 19:06.188
and you went,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.625
"I should catch that wave."

19:08.669 --> 19:11.672
How am I doing?

19:15.110 --> 19:16.242
Mm.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.550
That's not your DNA.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.162
I've got a half sister.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.164
I got it off of her.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.000
Your half sister's father
is Lenny?

19:36.044 --> 19:38.481
My mom told me the whole story.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.657
Told me to look after her
after she was gone.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.920
I got the DNA off of her.

19:45.793 --> 19:48.143
Look, and this is the truth:

19:48.187 --> 19:49.623
You think I'm trouble?

19:49.666 --> 19:51.494
Oh, I'm nothing compared to her.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
She's damaged goods.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.063
Hell on wheels.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.195
I mean, you could say

19:56.238 --> 20:00.460
I even did you all a favor.

20:10.644 --> 20:14.169
Nice office...
for a city employee.

20:14.213 --> 20:18.173
There's no reason for there
to be any animosity between us.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.610
I have no animosity; in fact,
I come bearing an offer.

20:20.654 --> 20:24.092
Aggravated harassment
in the first degree.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.528
Is that a joke?

20:25.572 --> 20:27.095
Assault, first degree.

20:27.138 --> 20:31.186
How about...
reckless endangerment?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.057
Assault two, final offer.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.146
Uh, he could get
up to seven years,

20:35.190 --> 20:37.845
and you don't have a case,
so no.

20:37.888 --> 20:42.023
How can you defend a guy
who preys on women like this?

20:42.066 --> 20:44.025
Olivia Wright is a gold digger.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.201
Doesn't give him
the right to abuse her.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.334
No. And it doesn't give
you the right to arrest him

20:48.377 --> 20:50.292
in the middle of the day
at his place of work.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.251
You did that on purpose

20:52.294 --> 20:54.253
to intimidate and humiliate him.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.211
Your client beats up women.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.865
He's quite comfortable

20:57.908 --> 21:00.563
with intimidation
and humiliation.

21:00.607 --> 21:04.306
I'm not some inexperienced
legal aid attorney.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.309
Olivia will be testifying
against him.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.181
Well, we'll see how that plays
with the jury.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.227
Great.
Then I guess we're done.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.663
Mm-hmm.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.843
Marriage is about
compromise, okay?

21:19.887 --> 21:23.238
And compromise is, by its
very nature, transactional.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.371
You give something,
you get something.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.591
So... I'm gonna
work midnights.

21:28.635 --> 21:31.290
And you are gonna quit

21:31.333 --> 21:33.204
looking the gift
horse in the mouth.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.684
That's not what I'm doing.

21:34.728 --> 21:35.990
Oh, my God.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.340
Our C.O. referred
her to us.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.212
You think he doesn't know
what services she provides?

21:41.256 --> 21:45.304
I'm sure he does,
b-but what if it's a test?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.131
A test for what?
Integrity.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.177
To see if these two are going
around with their hands out.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.221
No.

21:50.265 --> 21:51.527
Okay, not a test.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.355
But a way to have
a drop on the son

21:53.399 --> 21:55.183
and daughter-in-law
of the PC

21:55.226 --> 21:57.141
in case he ever needs it.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.579
Wow, are you cynical
all of a sudden.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.060
I could say, "Wow, are you
gullible," but I won't.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.193
You just did.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.283
Hey.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.372
So we're looking for any type
of common denominator--

22:10.416 --> 22:11.939
a school, a club,

22:11.982 --> 22:14.289
a teacher, a friend.
Anything.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.812
I got a HoopKing19.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.205
Nope. Not here.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.947
What about TeddyBear85?
You get that one?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.819
Yep. Back in October 2017,
he messaged Alexandra

22:22.863 --> 22:25.213
a week before she was killed.

22:25.256 --> 22:26.519
And I've got him
on Emily's Instagram, too,

22:26.562 --> 22:28.521
about three weeks
before she was killed.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.478
Can we trace who he is?

22:29.522 --> 22:30.697
Looks like he routed
the messages

22:30.740 --> 22:32.699
through an anonymous
text message service.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.004
Can we get into it?

22:34.048 --> 22:35.789
Not without getting a subpoena.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.486
I'll try hacking it now,
but it may take some time.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.532
Well, does he have a profile,
at least?

22:39.575 --> 22:40.924
He's listed as an artist.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.099
No photo.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.362
Wait a minute.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.059
He just DM'd another girl
about an hour ago.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.713
Who?Amanda Wallace.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.542
Sheepshead Bay.
God, she looks about 16.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.500
Is he asking her to meet?He asked her

22:51.544 --> 22:54.198
to meet him at the entrance
to the Third Street Playground.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.286
Third...

22:55.330 --> 22:56.810
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.377
That's Prospect Park.
What time?

22:58.420 --> 22:59.421
3:15.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.337
That's in 20 minutes.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.644
Let's go.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.524
Danny, is-is
that her?
I see.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.439
Amanda?

23:17.483 --> 23:18.440
Hey.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.224
Hold it!

23:21.225 --> 23:22.531
Hey!

23:22.575 --> 23:23.750
Police. Watch out. Move.

23:23.793 --> 23:24.707
Hey!

23:24.751 --> 23:26.883
Amanda. Stop. Stop.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.755
Stop. Okay.
It's okay.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.409
We're the police.
We're here to help.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.106
Oh, my God.Amanda,

23:32.149 --> 23:33.847
did you meet a man
earlier in the park?

23:33.890 --> 23:34.978
A TeddyBear85?

23:35.022 --> 23:36.502
Yes, yes, yes.
He was over there.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.242
I just--
I started running towards him,

23:38.286 --> 23:40.723
and that's when this woman--
she jumped in between us.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.682
And then she told me to run.
She said my life was in danger.

23:42.725 --> 23:43.813
: Please...Okay.

23:43.857 --> 23:44.858
Don't tell my parents.What-what lady?

23:44.901 --> 23:46.468
What lady?
What'd she look like?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.775
Um, she was my height, maybe.
Um...

23:48.818 --> 23:50.298
light brown hair.
She was pretty.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.299
In her 40s.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.214
Okay, where's this lady now?

23:53.257 --> 23:54.607
I don't know, okay?

23:54.650 --> 23:56.696
He got mad, and-and that's
when she told me to run.

23:56.739 --> 23:57.697
I...

23:59.525 --> 24:00.526
Maggie.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.831
Yeah.

24:01.875 --> 24:02.919
Maggie.

24:13.103 --> 24:16.063
Or...

24:16.106 --> 24:18.239
maybe I could get her immunity

24:18.282 --> 24:20.589
in exchange
for keeping the secret.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.591
Why?

24:22.635 --> 24:25.594
Second chance
to turn her life around.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.684
A chance to own
what a blessing it is

24:28.728 --> 24:31.208
to have Lenny Ross
have your back,

24:31.252 --> 24:33.297
have him as your father.

24:33.341 --> 24:36.518
So let Lenny go on thinking
that she's his daughter?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.520
There'd be mercy in that.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.870
That's not mercy
that's yours to give.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.481
Lenny loves her, Pop.

24:42.524 --> 24:46.049
Sees himself in her,
as fathers do.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.834
Why take that away from him?

24:47.877 --> 24:49.749
You can't take something away
that wasn't real

24:49.792 --> 24:51.315
in the first place.It's real to him.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.230
He thinks he has a daughter.

24:53.274 --> 24:54.797
Apparently, he does.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.625
Just not this grifter.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.236
You know,
I'm practically quoting Carrie

24:59.280 --> 25:00.411
when she said to me,

25:00.455 --> 25:02.196
"You think I'm bad?

25:02.239 --> 25:04.285
You should see her."

25:04.328 --> 25:06.592
Says the grifter.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.637
Consider the source.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.296
Pop, I don't know what to do.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.167
Mm.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.957
You know, when I asked Lenny

25:24.000 --> 25:26.960
why he never told me
he had a daughter,

25:27.003 --> 25:28.962
you know what he said to me?

25:29.005 --> 25:31.704
Basically, he said
I wouldn't understand

25:31.747 --> 25:34.489
'cause we have a model family.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.491
Well, hardly that.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.232
Again, it's what he thinks,

25:38.275 --> 25:40.930
not what's real.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
Invite him to dinner Sunday.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.939
Maybe you and I can press
a few hot buttons.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.899
Get Danny
all riled up.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.902
Get Erin and Nicky clutching
their pearls.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.605
And we've decided
to take you up on your offer

26:03.649 --> 26:05.433
for both of us
to stay in the 2-9.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.435
With me working midnights.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.176
So, thank you.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.177
Glad to hear it.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.874
How's the house-hunting going?

26:13.528 --> 26:15.312
Eileen is great, boss.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.445
She showed us some
fantastic places.

26:17.488 --> 26:18.446
But we're
just not comfortable

26:18.489 --> 26:19.839
taking that kind of discount,

26:19.882 --> 26:22.929
on account of being cops
named Reagan.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.060
And Janko-Reagan.

26:24.104 --> 26:25.366
Yeah.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.063
I kind of gathered that.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.412
Can I ask you
a question?

26:28.456 --> 26:29.457
All due respect,

26:29.500 --> 26:31.241
was this some kind of a test?

26:31.285 --> 26:32.416
Not exactly.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.331
Mostly confirmation
that you two

26:34.375 --> 26:35.550
take the high road.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.943
Not because you have to
but because

26:36.986 --> 26:38.509
that's the way
you're built.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.295
I have an offer for you.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.776
My mother lived in
a big two-bedroom just outside

26:43.819 --> 26:45.473
the precinct border.
Rent-controlled.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.561
$1,150 a month.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.302
I actually hold the lease,

26:48.345 --> 26:50.521
and she just relocated
to Florida.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.001
It's yours if you want it.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.612
Yeah.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.178
Uh, yeah.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.615
That-that sounds
great, boss.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.486
Thank you.I have to warn you,

26:58.529 --> 27:00.488
it's not like those hip places
you've been looking at.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.490
Mostly a bunch of old ladies.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.492
Overly cautious, at that.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.493
Oh.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.581
You'll fit right in.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.367
Thank you so much.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.548
Dad, you're gonna
break the plate.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.814
:
Oh, my goodness.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.685
Yay.This is harder than it looks.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.165
No, it's not.
It's like this.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.820
Look, you got to get purchase
on the widest part. Okay?

27:27.863 --> 27:29.256
Okay.Apply steady pressure.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.214
And... voilà.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.128
Wow.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.347
There you go!See?

27:33.390 --> 27:34.740
How come only the claws?

27:34.783 --> 27:36.655
What do they do with the rest
of the little guys?

27:36.698 --> 27:37.656
They go back in the water.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.092
Like amputees?

27:39.135 --> 27:40.876
Oh, no, no. The-the
claws grow back.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.226
A lot of fishermen
only take one claw,

27:43.270 --> 27:44.924
so the crab can defend itself
against predators

27:44.967 --> 27:46.577
while the other one's
growing back.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.843
Kind of like cops these days.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.367
And how is that, Pop?

27:53.410 --> 27:56.718
Well, one hand tied
behind their back because

27:56.762 --> 27:58.154
of the lawyers
and the activist judges.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.808
You ask me...

27:59.852 --> 28:00.809
Which nobody did, by the way.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.898
He's absolutely right.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.466
Even got us wearing
nanny cams now.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.772
A body cam is not

28:06.815 --> 28:07.947
a nanny cam.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.426
Same difference.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.560
Uh, no. The nanny doesn't
know she's being recorded,

28:12.603 --> 28:14.693
and the cop does.
He's fully aware

28:14.736 --> 28:17.260
that he's responsible and
accountable for all his actions.

28:17.304 --> 28:18.740
She has a point, Dad.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.699
No, she doesn't have
a point, college boy.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.048
She's trying to make
a rationalization

28:22.091 --> 28:25.138
for the bad guys have it
easier to do their jobs

28:25.181 --> 28:27.749
than the cops
have it easier to do ours.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.838
Any good cop has
all the latitude he needs

28:29.882 --> 28:31.361
to do his job well.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.973
Every cop is
a good cop in my book.

28:34.016 --> 28:36.845
Well, then you are missing
a few chapters in that book.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.152
Why don't both
of you guys calm down?Then you must be missing

28:39.195 --> 28:41.023
some brains
in that head of yours.It's Sunday dinner.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.764
Hey! That's my job.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.635
You better get to it then.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.769
Yeah. Set her straight.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.858
W-- Excuse me?

28:49.902 --> 28:52.295
What do you think, Lenny?

28:54.167 --> 28:56.212
Oh, I think Danny's
on the right side of this.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.474
Thank you.

28:57.518 --> 28:58.911
There you go.I think that
the safety net

28:58.954 --> 29:00.303
for the bad guys
has gotten much stronger,

29:00.347 --> 29:01.870
while the cops are...

29:01.914 --> 29:04.264
No, it's just civil rights
has finally begun to catch up

29:04.307 --> 29:06.440
to the absolute authority
of the police.While cops keep seeing

29:06.483 --> 29:09.051
their tool belts stripped and
their standing diminished.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.226
Absolutely correct.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.056
Wait, wait, wait...

29:15.841 --> 29:16.929
Exactly right.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.974
Hold on! Hold on!

29:19.018 --> 29:19.932
What?

29:21.760 --> 29:25.459
You're comparing one-armed
stone crabs to modern policing.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.417
That's kind of a leap,
even for you, isn't it?

29:27.461 --> 29:28.854
What?

29:28.897 --> 29:29.985
And you just

29:30.029 --> 29:31.552
picked it up
and ran with it,

29:31.595 --> 29:32.988
like Jason Taylor from Miami.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.511
And I think,

29:34.555 --> 29:36.600
somehow, Lenny,
this was all for your benefit.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.994
For some reason, these
two wanted you to see
a family squabble

29:39.038 --> 29:39.995
with your dinner.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.083
I don't know why.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.087
I think I do.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.829
Nice try.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.918
Thank you, Frankie.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.879
What are friends for?

30:03.802 --> 30:04.890
That's him.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.848
And there's Maggie.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.155
Come on. Show your face,
you son of a bitch.

30:09.198 --> 30:12.375
Okay, stop right there
and try to zoom in on the plate.

30:12.419 --> 30:15.770
Zebra-1472.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.858
Run it.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.992
Comes back
to a trucking company.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.646
Big Hal's Moving Company,
out of Long Island.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.039
A moving company?

30:24.083 --> 30:25.258
Well,
that would explain

30:25.301 --> 30:28.130
the murders in Jersey
and Pennsylvania.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.874
Who pays your rent, Ms. Wright?

30:32.918 --> 30:34.571
Objection.
Relevance.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.400
I'm just trying to
establish the nature

30:37.444 --> 30:40.969
of the relationship between
Ms. Wright and Mr. Spencer.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.492
Overruled.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.973
I'll allow it.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.367
John Spencer does.

30:48.977 --> 30:51.893
And how much does he pay?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.721
$8,000 a month.

30:55.070 --> 30:55.984
Wow.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.159
Hefty.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.900
That's a nice bag.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.511
Was that also a gift
from Mr. Spencer, too?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.731
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.298
I'm sorry.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.690
I will withdraw.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.170
Ms. Wright,

31:08.214 --> 31:11.826
did Mr. Spencer
ever hit you?

31:14.960 --> 31:15.917
No.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.658
Your Honor,
I'd like a recess.

31:17.701 --> 31:18.659
Denied.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.095
Continue.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.359
So you just said

31:23.403 --> 31:25.100
that Mr. Spencer

31:25.144 --> 31:27.929
did nothit you.

31:27.973 --> 31:33.108
So then why would you tell
A.D.A. Reagan that he did?

31:33.152 --> 31:35.502
She pressured me.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.504
I'm sorry.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.985
I'm very sorry, but...

31:40.028 --> 31:41.856
I lied.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.644
No more questions.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.705
Raymond Klinger,
42 years old.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.055
Been a driver for the company
for four years.

32:07.099 --> 32:10.276
Ah, right around the time
the murders started.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.106
Raymond?

32:14.149 --> 32:15.629
Mr. Klinger?!

32:20.416 --> 32:22.288
Clear.

32:23.506 --> 32:24.681
Danny.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.037
Police! Get your hands
where I can see 'em.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.647
Put 'em on the steering wheel,

32:33.690 --> 32:35.475
throw the keys
out the window,

32:35.518 --> 32:37.042
and then slowly step
out of the vehicle!

32:37.085 --> 32:39.174
Come on! Get your hands
where I can see 'em!

32:39.218 --> 32:40.088
Now!

32:41.611 --> 32:42.482
Danny.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.489
Stay back.

32:49.532 --> 32:50.881
Stay back.

32:50.925 --> 32:51.926
Okay.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.275
Take it easy. We
just want to talk

32:53.319 --> 32:54.711
and ask you some questions,
all right?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.149
I know what you want
to talk about.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.325
Where's Maggie?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.546
Did you kill Maggie?

33:03.590 --> 33:05.896
Maybe, maybe not.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.028
What did you do

33:07.072 --> 33:08.290
with Maggie Gibson?

33:08.334 --> 33:09.683
I'll never tell.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.772
Don't do it. No!

33:13.165 --> 33:15.254
Danny, get back!

33:15.297 --> 33:18.257
Maggie! Maggie!

33:20.172 --> 33:22.696
Maggie!

33:22.739 --> 33:25.351
Maggie! Maggie!

33:30.704 --> 33:33.141
Maggie! Maggie!

33:33.185 --> 33:34.925
Come on, Maggie.

33:34.969 --> 33:35.926
Come on!

33:35.970 --> 33:37.319
Come on.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.214
Hey, where are you?

34:02.257 --> 34:04.825
I'm a couple blocks away.
Wait for me outside.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.566
Too late.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.524
Why are you in such a-a rush

34:08.568 --> 34:09.569
to talk to this woman, anyway?

34:09.612 --> 34:11.788
Get away from me!

34:11.831 --> 34:13.746
Anthony, her door is open.ABETEMARCO: Erin!

34:13.790 --> 34:15.009
Do not go in there!

34:15.053 --> 34:16.228
Do not.

34:16.271 --> 34:17.489
Get away from me!

34:17.533 --> 34:19.360
Ah, damn it, Erin!

34:20.623 --> 34:23.322
Get out! Get out right now!
Get out.
Huh?

34:23.364 --> 34:24.975
Get out of my house!Gonna stab me with a knife?

34:25.018 --> 34:26.107
Yes! Yes!JOHN: Yeah?

34:26.150 --> 34:27.413
Get out of my house!

34:27.456 --> 34:28.675
What are you
gonna do? Kill me?

34:28.717 --> 34:31.112
Stay away from me! Get out!Hey, John! John!

34:31.156 --> 34:32.199
John! Step back!

34:32.244 --> 34:34.114
Step back now! Step back.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.681
Step away from her.
Olivia,

34:35.725 --> 34:37.379
put that knife down.
I already called 911.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.121
The cops are on their way.
Now back off!

34:40.165 --> 34:41.382
Get out of my house.Step back.

34:41.427 --> 34:42.514
Put the knife down, Olivia.

34:42.558 --> 34:43.603
He tried to kill me.Okay.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.561
He tried to kill me!All right.

34:45.605 --> 34:46.867
Put the knife down!

34:50.000 --> 34:51.480
John! John, don't!

34:56.746 --> 34:58.444
Oh, God!

34:58.487 --> 35:00.359
Erin, I'm here.
I'm here.

35:02.752 --> 35:03.623
I got him. I got him.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.581
I got him. Turn over.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.495
Turn over!

35:06.539 --> 35:08.410
Turn over. Shut up!

35:09.411 --> 35:10.760
Okay? Stay with me here.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.545
You're gonna be okay.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.205
Too bad you're
not a better shot.

35:21.684 --> 35:24.034
I can't be speaking to you.
You know that.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.384
He's not a client anymore.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.473
His true colors emerged

35:27.516 --> 35:28.952
even before
the incident tonight.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.520
So, if you need
representation...

35:31.564 --> 35:33.174
I'll pass.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.524
I hope there's
no hard feelings.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.224
I'm glad you're okay.

35:42.792 --> 35:46.231
I like having a formidable
opponent in the courtroom.

35:52.411 --> 35:53.803
What does she want?

35:53.847 --> 35:56.023
Absolution, I think.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.591
Well, Spencer's stable.
He was arraigned bedside

35:58.634 --> 36:00.158
for attempted murder.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.203
Olivia just got her surgery.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.814
Prognosis is good.Great.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.294
Thank you, Anthony.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.952
You shouldn't have went
in there alone.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.306
But for the record,

36:18.350 --> 36:21.266
I admire your chutzpah, okay?

36:21.309 --> 36:24.051
I'm not sure you're supposed
to be checking out my chutzpah.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.753
So, doc says you're
gonna be okay.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.190
Thanks to you.

36:32.233 --> 36:35.628
Mm. Thanks to you, a little
girl's life was saved.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.239
I'm just glad
that he can't hurt anybody else

36:38.283 --> 36:41.634
and that Mr. Miller
can finally have some closure.

36:41.677 --> 36:45.203
I also, uh, wanted
to say sorry.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.467
You know, for giving
you a hard time.

36:48.510 --> 36:52.471
I'm trying to stay open to what
you see and hear. It's just...

36:52.514 --> 36:55.561
My gift-- or my curse,

36:55.604 --> 36:57.127
depending on how
you look at it--

36:57.171 --> 36:59.260
it tends to alienate people,

36:59.304 --> 37:02.263
so I'm kind of used to it.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.788
If you need a ride,
I'd be happy to wait

37:05.832 --> 37:07.573
and, uh, drive you home.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.320
You ready to go?

37:16.364 --> 37:18.366
Yeah.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.328
You know what?

37:23.371 --> 37:26.331
I will catch up with you
another time.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.377
Good idea.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.512
Bye.

37:39.909 --> 37:42.303
Since when do you use
Edgecombe for central booking?

37:42.347 --> 37:44.305
They don't.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.743
So, you pulled
work release for Carrie?

37:47.787 --> 37:51.399
Carrie's not your daughter.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.275
Look...

38:00.408 --> 38:02.367
Lenny...

38:02.410 --> 38:04.282
It's complicated.

38:04.325 --> 38:07.023
Carrie copped some DNA

38:07.067 --> 38:09.722
off her half sister.

38:09.765 --> 38:12.246
So...

38:12.290 --> 38:13.769
So?

38:17.338 --> 38:19.297
She'syour daughter.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.868
Oh.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.481
And she's here.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.135
Oh.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.312
Other side of that door.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.491
You want to meet her?

38:39.534 --> 38:42.145
You don't have to.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.366
What's she in for?

38:45.410 --> 38:46.715
Seriously?

38:46.759 --> 38:48.717
I'm processing a lot
right now, okay, Frank?

38:48.761 --> 38:50.502
Grand larceny auto.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.374
She know I'm coming?

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
She doesn't know anything.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.335
She alone in there?

38:57.378 --> 38:59.511
No, it's a common room.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.345
Well, how am I gonna know
which one?

39:08.433 --> 39:10.391
You're a cop.
You'll figure it out.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.532
Hey.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.187
Hi.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.798
I, uh...

40:11.234 --> 40:14.324
I knew your mother,
Melina, back in the day.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.505
I'm sorry for your loss.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.811
What do you mean, "knew her"?

40:22.855 --> 40:25.161
Well...

40:25.205 --> 40:28.556
We were close for a while.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.384
But then she decided

40:30.428 --> 40:32.604
she didn't want to be
with a cop.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.607
You're a cop?

40:35.650 --> 40:38.958
I was, yeah.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.918
Like, you knew herknew her?

40:43.963 --> 40:45.399
Yes.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.487
As in...?

40:47.532 --> 40:49.534
Yeah.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.536
Sorry.

40:53.538 --> 40:56.715
Sit down, will you?

40:57.759 --> 40:59.674
Thanks.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.355
Just had fresh paint, so
I left the windows open

41:28.398 --> 41:30.139
for you.Thank you.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.880
In here's the compactor chute
and recyclables bins.All right.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.188
And... here we are.JANKO: Got it.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.546
Wow, it's nice.

41:45.590 --> 41:46.852
Made you two sets.

41:46.895 --> 41:49.463
Thank you.Whoa, whoa. Oh,
wait a second.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.639
Wait a second.Now what?

41:51.683 --> 41:52.684
I'll tell you now what.

41:52.727 --> 41:54.599
Now we stop jabbing
each other,

41:54.642 --> 41:56.514
and we start counting
our blessings.

41:58.298 --> 41:59.908
Old tradition?

41:59.952 --> 42:02.128
Groom carries his bride across
the threshold of their new home,

42:02.171 --> 42:03.651
and it brings good luck.Mm.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.699
You mind taking a picture?Not at all.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.615
Thank you.

42:10.658 --> 42:13.574
So, are you ready,
Mrs. Janko-Reagan?

42:13.618 --> 42:15.489
You know what? How about...

42:15.533 --> 42:18.318
Officer Janko at work

42:18.361 --> 42:21.887
and just Mrs. Reagan at home?

42:21.930 --> 42:24.542
That sounds good to me.

42:27.806 --> 42:30.678
Oh, my God.
