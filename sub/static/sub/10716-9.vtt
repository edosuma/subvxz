00:12.546 --> 00:15.349
Gunfire erupted outside
the First National
Pacific Bank Monday morning.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.585
Around the Sylmar
Shopping Plaza,

00:17.618 --> 00:18.887
customers stopped
to take notice

00:18.920 --> 00:20.688
when a confrontation...

00:20.721 --> 00:21.956
She's a cool customer.

00:21.990 --> 00:25.426
cold and hot.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.794
Don't touch.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.863
You will get burned.

00:28.897 --> 00:30.264
Police continue to search

00:30.298 --> 00:32.901
for former LAPD
detective Carl Nash,

00:32.934 --> 00:34.969
alleged ringleader
of a crew of corrupt...

00:35.003 --> 00:36.871
- A babe like her--
- Mm-hmm.

00:36.905 --> 00:39.640
...tangled up
with a lug like him.

00:39.673 --> 00:43.077
Do-re-mi, baby.
Do-re-mi.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.946
- Ha.
- ...stolen vehicles.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.481
Police departments
throughout Los Angeles area

00:47.515 --> 00:48.917
continue to pursue Nash.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.357
Detective, before we start,
a few ground rules.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.458
Ground rules.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.927
For the last 48 hours,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.395
my client has answered
every question put to her.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.533
She's cooperated fully
with RHD and FID detectives.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.069
She's here
of her own volition.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.238
I won't allow you
to bully her.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.472
Bully.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.942
Mrs. Allen, more than anyone,

01:13.942 --> 01:16.277
wants to know
who killed her husband.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.845
Well, then maybe
she can tell me

01:17.946 --> 01:19.080
how Carl Nash knew

01:19.113 --> 01:21.049
she'd be at that bank
that morning.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.751
As I've said until I am
blue in the face,

01:23.784 --> 01:25.186
I don't know.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.588
Did you double-cross him,
or did he double-cross you?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.991
I knew the man to say
hello to at the front gate.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.326
Was it your idea
or his idea?

01:33.694 --> 01:35.863
Was what his idea or mine?

01:35.964 --> 01:37.398
- To kill your husband.
- Detective--

01:37.431 --> 01:40.101
I had nothing to do
with my husband's death.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.536
When you looked in that
empty safe deposit box,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.372
it must have been a shock.

01:46.007 --> 01:47.976
I went there to collect
what was mine legally.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.844
What did you expect
to find?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.780
Documents, papers,
photographs.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.415
I had no idea
what Tony had in there.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.583
Cash?

01:56.850 --> 01:59.453
You're busy concocting
a fantasy, detective.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.255
It never happened.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.027
What a grim workplace
you inhabit.

02:07.028 --> 02:09.063
Does it ever get you down?

02:09.097 --> 02:11.899
I kind of like it.
It inspires me.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.268
I bet it does.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.636
Suits you.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.573
If you think this is grim,
imagine what prison is like.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.076
If Carl Nash
killed my husband,

02:22.110 --> 02:24.545
he deserves to rot in one
for the rest of his life.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.680
Where do you think Layla is?

02:26.714 --> 02:28.016
Don't know, don't care.

02:28.016 --> 02:30.251
Sure you do.
She's got the money, right?

02:30.284 --> 02:31.652
Your money.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.022
You and your stories,
detective.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.265
She got to that
safe deposit box

02:44.298 --> 02:46.600
the day after your
husband's body was found.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.339
The box was
in her name, too.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.241
She didn't have to wait
for probate.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.578
What do you think's
in that backpack?

02:59.180 --> 03:02.216
I'm betting it's not
the Allen family photos.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.622
Layla outsmarted you
and Nash both.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.299
Have a nice chat?

03:18.332 --> 03:20.301
She's had two days
to get her story straight

03:20.334 --> 03:22.436
while Edgar and I
jump through hoops
on the bank.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.738
Where are we on Allen's
other five accounts?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.340
Frozen. I called the IRS.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.576
Told them there were laundered
funds in those accounts.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.777
She can't touch them.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.346
So, speaking
of the merry widow?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.182
Can't go to the DA
with what we've got.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.150
As of now, she walks.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.719
Where's your car?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.088
Let's take this one.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.698
Mrs. Allen,
I'm Martin Weiss.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.999
We met
a couple of years ago

03:52.100 --> 03:53.534
At Freddie Macnekian's
funeral.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.536
Yeah, I know who you are.
Ed, what is this?

03:55.569 --> 03:58.572
Mr. Weiss has
a proposal for you.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.541
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:33.574 --> 04:36.009
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:36.043 --> 04:38.512
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:38.546 --> 04:41.549
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:41.582 --> 04:44.152
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:44.152 --> 04:47.020
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:47.054 --> 04:49.623
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

04:49.657 --> 04:51.392
* I can't let go

05:03.771 --> 05:06.207
* I feel

05:12.813 --> 05:14.915
The man
who had my son murdered

05:14.948 --> 05:16.917
was in our sights,
and now he's gone.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.420
He'll turn up.
It's just a matter of time.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.290
I swore I'd look him
in the eye.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.659
Might not work out that way.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.332
You and Edgar
will now be part

05:31.365 --> 05:33.201
of RHD's overarching
investigations.

05:33.201 --> 05:35.736
So I gather.
Eyes and ears?

05:35.769 --> 05:39.540
Eyes and ears.
That'll be all, detective.

05:46.214 --> 05:47.781
Bosch, Edgar.

05:47.815 --> 05:48.982
Where is everybody?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.351
Out beating the bushes.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.985
Thanks for stopping by.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.787
Hey, we're here.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.256
We got another case,
you know.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.790
The Tony Allen murder.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.992
You had eyes on our suspect
since you questioned her?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.462
Mrs. Allen? No, we don't
have the manpower.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.431
Tips are coming in
fast and furious.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.233
We're checking out leads
from here to Tucson.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.467
She give you anything?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.101
I didn't lay a glove on her.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.103
We want you to keep
working the Allen murder,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.505
but Nash is now
the priority.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.307
What's the current thinking
on his whereabouts?

06:13.341 --> 06:15.676
He dropped his hostage off
at the edge of Angeles Forest

06:15.709 --> 06:17.144
on Highway 14.

06:17.245 --> 06:19.247
Took her a couple of hours
to get to a phone.

06:19.247 --> 06:21.048
She said he was
headed north on 14

06:21.081 --> 06:22.516
toward Lancaster
and Palmdale,

06:22.550 --> 06:24.318
which is ground zero
at the moment.

06:24.352 --> 06:26.754
Ex-cop. Knows the moves.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.756
He would have ditched
the car by now, right?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.123
That was our
assumption, too.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.392
We're waiting for it
to turn up.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.860
He might have been too injured

06:32.893 --> 06:34.127
to stop to switch cars.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.396
It was a serious
gunshot wound.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.530
He was dragging that leg.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.399
Maybe he hasn't
gotten that far.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.434
Maybe he's holed up
somewhere closer in.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.570
Okay. So what do you
want us to do?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.605
Follow the guns.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.274
From the shootout.

06:46.274 --> 06:48.542
We collected six weapons
from the scene.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.379
Nash's crew had no serial
numbers on their weapons.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.946
Firearms has them now.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
It'll take them
a couple of days.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.049
They'll call you
when they're ready

06:56.083 --> 06:57.184
for you to follow up.

06:57.285 --> 06:59.820
Okay, no problem.
What else?

06:59.853 --> 07:02.356
The DA's negotiating
a deal with O'Grady,

07:02.390 --> 07:03.724
pushing it through.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.893
Exigent circumstances
with Nash at large.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.128
We could use one of you
at the first interview.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.497
Ask about the Allen case.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.631
Let us know.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.932
Keep us in the loop.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.900
For real this time.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.739
The guy can be anywhere.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.425
Ohh.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.099
Ohh.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.470
God damn it. Ohh.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.383
Come on. Uhh.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.654
Uhh.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.626
Ohh!

08:48.161 --> 08:49.863
It sucks we don't
have eyes on her.

08:49.897 --> 08:53.434
Harry, I've got an idea
for keeping tabs on Veronica.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.736
Write a warrant
for her GPS tracker.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.904
Release the Bentley.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.639
At least then
we'll know where she is

08:58.672 --> 09:00.474
- when she's driving that.
- That's good.

09:00.508 --> 09:02.410
We'll need a tracker
on the Range Rover, too.

09:02.410 --> 09:03.644
I'll include it.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.913
But then we got
to get it on her car,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.214
get past the gate.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.482
Put on your ninja
slippers.

09:08.516 --> 09:10.117
Funny.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.219
We'll figure out
an excuse to go see her.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
That'll make her lawyer happy.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.688
Oh, yeah.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.926
Ooh, that's quite
the fuck-you.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.993
Isn't it?

09:22.029 --> 09:23.631
She has family in Armenia.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.799
We can contact them, see if
they've heard from her.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.435
How do you know that?

09:27.435 --> 09:30.438
Mr. Marks had me do
a background check on them.

09:30.438 --> 09:33.173
He did that for all
Tony's chippies?

09:33.206 --> 09:35.443
Layla was an exception.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.483
For the life of me,
I don't see it.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.452
What was so special
about her?

09:44.452 --> 09:45.586
Mousy little thing.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.921
Tony was in love with her.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.056
She was Armenian.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.193
Mr. Marks needed to know
she was on the level.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.028
What would he think now?

09:58.165 --> 10:00.734
She surprised us all.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.775
So have you considered
our proposal?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.177
50%?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.178
Huh.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.015
Once the funds
are recovered,

10:15.048 --> 10:18.351
you want this to be over.
I can make that happen,

10:18.385 --> 10:21.021
intercede on your behalf.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.190
With the organization?

10:23.223 --> 10:27.094
Or I can make it go
the other way.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.962
You'll
end up with nothing.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.898
50%? That is fucking--

10:30.931 --> 10:34.034
Only... fair.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.845
Fair enough.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
Thanks for
bringing me here, Dad.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.122
Best chocolate shake
in L.A.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.525
- You always say that.
- I do?

10:57.558 --> 10:59.493
Best pizza,
best pancakes.

10:59.527 --> 11:01.529
Well, if I don't know,
who does?

11:01.562 --> 11:03.531
How's your shake?

11:03.531 --> 11:05.198
Oh, it's the best chocolate
shake I've ever had.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.800
Ha-ha, smart ass.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.569
Your mother doesn't know
what she's missing.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.538
I swear I think
she's going vegan on us.

11:10.538 --> 11:14.407
She's always talking
about gluten this
and soy that.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.143
This isn't gluten-free,
is it?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.110
I think we're safe.

11:20.614 --> 11:24.084
Bet you'll be glad to have
the house to yourself again.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.986
Quite the contrary.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.256
It's been really nice
for me having you around.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.858
It's time you went home.

11:30.891 --> 11:35.162
See your friends,
get back to your routine.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.830
Get ready for school.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.231
Ugh.

11:41.569 --> 11:42.836
I'll miss you.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.772
Me, too.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.743
Do you know
what Mom's going to do?

11:49.777 --> 11:51.111
Have you talked to her?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.913
A little.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.016
She sees some new
possibilities
in front of her--

11:56.049 --> 11:58.819
a chapter of her life
she thought was closed.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.489
She keeps talking
about big changes.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.592
It's kind of
freaking me out.

12:04.592 --> 12:07.460
Maddie, your mother's
a very smart woman.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.697
She and Reggie
will figure it out.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.780
Uhh...

12:32.886 --> 12:34.788
Yeah, we're closed.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.023
Kat?

12:37.157 --> 12:38.225
It's Carl.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.098
Carl?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.233
Kat.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.636
Jesus, what happened?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.639
- Help me.
- Ohh!

13:01.214 --> 13:03.516
Clean through and through.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.854
You are lucky
it missed your femoral.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.724
Oh, I'm lucky you're
a large animal veterinarian.

13:13.026 --> 13:17.164
You're a funny guy, Carl.
You always have been.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.867
Secret of my success.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.670
I'm serious.

13:22.703 --> 13:24.938
If it had hit
your femoral--

13:24.972 --> 13:26.373
- I'd be fucked.
- You'd be dead.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.543
You may still be.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.579
You belong
in a hospital.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.914
There's no telling
how much nerve

13:33.947 --> 13:35.348
and muscle damage
you've got.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.817
I'll put you
on antibiotics,

13:36.850 --> 13:40.688
but you ought to be
on an IV.

13:40.688 --> 13:43.123
Katherine, is there anything
you want to ask me?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.193
Nope.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.163
You don't follow the news?

13:51.899 --> 13:55.068
I don't have a TV.
You know that.

13:56.737 --> 13:58.105
You've got internet?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.339
I don't want to know

13:59.372 --> 14:00.741
what's
going on in the world.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.175
That's why I moved
out here.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.812
Hey.

14:07.715 --> 14:09.316
Keep me in the dark, Carl.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.818
Okay?

14:14.788 --> 14:16.824
That little sc-- Come here.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.092
That little scar
on your lip.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.328
I've already told you
about that.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.630
Tell me again.
Refresh me.

14:23.731 --> 14:26.734
I got kicked by a horse.
I've had it ever since.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.778
Ohh.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.467
Thank you so much.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.903
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

15:39.907 --> 15:42.876
All right. I know this is
the initial interview

15:42.910 --> 15:45.946
and we're just getting
the lay of the land here,

15:45.979 --> 15:47.714
but let's cut
to the elephant in the room.

15:47.815 --> 15:49.216
where is he?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.219
Ahem. I don't know.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.087
You must have some idea.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.457
He'd disappear
days on end.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.092
Wouldn't answer his cell.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.395
He'd say he was out where
there was no cell coverage.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.997
You said she could
give us Nash.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.099
On a platter legally.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.601
We never said she knew
his current whereabouts.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.603
I have a signed
agreement with the DA.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.839
Do you have
more questions?

16:11.839 --> 16:14.041
Riley, Piccininni,
Arceneaux, all dead.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.846
That was the crew.
He kept it tight.

16:20.848 --> 16:22.482
Who shot Tony Allen?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.451
Riley.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.518
How do you know?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.654
I was there.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.890
I flagged him
on his way home.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.724
So he stopped
to help you.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.560
Right.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.964
Let's get
back to George Irving.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.199
Nash had big plans for him...

16:40.868 --> 16:43.303
till we found out
he was an IA rat.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.537
Who shot him?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.273
Riley, probably.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.607
I don't know for sure.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.409
What do you know about
Arceneaux's suicide?

16:51.544 --> 16:52.545
Wasn't.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.081
How do you know?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.683
I was there.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.418
Who actually
pulled the trigger?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.020
Riley.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.589
All three murders?
That's convenient.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.693
He was Nash's boy.
Did his wet work.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.230
What about Veronica Allen?

17:10.263 --> 17:13.366
That bitch.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.968
Where does she fit in?

17:16.937 --> 17:18.305
Carl was playing her.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.908
In what way?

17:20.908 --> 17:23.010
He was boning her.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.745
Said she was
in love with him.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.247
You sure
she wasn't playing him?

17:48.635 --> 17:51.371
That bastard.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.339
Who? Tony?

17:53.606 --> 17:56.443
Divorce papers.
Did you know?

17:56.476 --> 17:57.610
No.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.946
Oh, big fucking deal.

17:58.979 --> 18:00.347
He was going to leave me
the house

18:00.380 --> 18:01.548
with two mortgages.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.092
Shit.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.978
My husband
passed away recently.

18:31.011 --> 18:33.080
- My condolences.
- Mm.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.347
As executor of his estate,

18:34.381 --> 18:36.516
I'm authorized
to assemble his finances.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.817
Of course.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.452
I found that receipt
in his desk.

18:41.088 --> 18:42.990
How can I help you,
Mrs. Allen?

18:43.023 --> 18:45.592
A year ago
you sold my husband

18:45.625 --> 18:48.395
$1.1 million
of bearer bonds.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.664
That's correct.
A legal transaction.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.066
Oh, I'm sure.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.702
The bonds are missing.
I'm trying to locate them.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.237
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.672
It's almost impossible
to recover bearer bonds

18:59.706 --> 19:01.141
if they're lost
or stolen.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.309
Hmm. I know that.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.611
I also know that
bearer bonds are used

19:04.644 --> 19:06.413
for money laundering,
tax evasion,

19:06.446 --> 19:09.916
and other illicit
business transactions.

19:10.017 --> 19:11.418
You're very well informed.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.221
Hmm. My husband
was a money launderer.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.125
He told me
he was a producer

19:18.158 --> 19:19.459
of adult entertainment.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.862
Please. Let's cut the crap,
Mr. Morada.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.764
You knew the real source
of my husband's income.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.266
You helped him wash it.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.036
That would be
very hard to prove.

19:29.036 --> 19:30.503
What you couldn't have known

19:30.537 --> 19:31.938
was that some of that money

19:32.039 --> 19:33.440
that you and my husband
laundered

19:33.473 --> 19:36.343
Tony stole from his cousin
Joey Marks.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.379
Now, obviously
the Armenians don't know

19:39.412 --> 19:40.847
you were involved in that,
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.549
Well, you certainly wouldn't.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.386
I appreciate your discretion.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.554
But they will

19:47.587 --> 19:51.191
if you don't help me
find my fucking money.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.595
Rykoff estimated

19:55.628 --> 19:58.565
Tony Allen skimmed
upwards of $4 million.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.600
- Also, Jer--
- Yeah.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.171
An hour ago, Veronica Allen
visited a bond trader downtown.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.106
She's on her way
home now.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.242
So they still issue these--
these bearer bonds?

20:09.276 --> 20:12.312
No. But there's still
some floating around.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.781
Hmm. All right.
We're checking out.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.015
First thing in the morning.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.750
We need to get
that second tracker

20:17.784 --> 20:18.918
on her other car.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.953
Let's go make nice
with Mrs. Allen.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.289
I was awfully
hard on her yesterday,

20:22.322 --> 20:23.856
and I feel just plain
sick about it.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.159
Community relations.
I'm all in.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.878
Detective, my lawyer told you
to stay away from me.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.280
I came to apologize.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.716
I didn't think
your lawyer would mind.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.585
Then come in
and have a drink.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.321
I'm on duty.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.623
Come in
while I have a drink.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.504
Sure I can't entice you?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.773
No. No, thank you.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.441
Well, you were saying?

21:48.475 --> 21:51.077
We've changed our
assessment of the case.

21:51.178 --> 21:53.813
The surviving officer's
cooperating.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.014
She's given a statement.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.183
She has?

21:56.183 --> 21:57.917
According to her,

21:57.950 --> 21:59.686
Nash planned
your husband's murder,

21:59.719 --> 22:02.555
and she and his accomplices
carried it out.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.192
Carl Nash is now

22:05.192 --> 22:06.759
the sole focus of our
investigation,

22:06.793 --> 22:09.196
but I wanted to apologize
on behalf of the department

22:09.229 --> 22:11.231
for suggesting you were
involved in any way.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.568
Well, you don't know
how much I appreciate that.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.769
And I'd appreciate it

22:16.803 --> 22:19.506
if you kept our
conversation confidential.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.375
When we catch Nash,
we'll need you to testify.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.577
Testify to what, detective?

22:24.611 --> 22:27.480
Hmm, that'll depend
on his defense.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.282
I'm sure he'll try
to cut a deal

22:29.316 --> 22:31.083
to stay off death row

22:31.117 --> 22:33.052
and implicate as many
other people as he can.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.488
Hmm. You'll have
to catch him first.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.225
Oh, we will.

22:38.225 --> 22:40.092
He was seriously wounded
in the shootout.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.628
Most likely
he's holed up somewhere

22:41.661 --> 22:43.062
weak as a kitten.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.532
We'll scoop him up,
and he'll start talking.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.133
Hmm.

22:47.234 --> 22:48.901
Well,
let's hope that happens.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.438
We're counting on it.

22:52.872 --> 22:53.940
Anyway,

22:53.973 --> 22:55.708
have a nice evening.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.244
I'll see myself out.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.091
He's up to something.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.560
Of course he is.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.429
Men only say they're sorry
when they want something.

23:21.301 --> 23:22.869
Let me take you
to dinner.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.773
I know what you want.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.308
Can you blame me?

23:28.341 --> 23:31.278
No. If I were you,
I'd want me, too.

23:32.279 --> 23:33.880
I won't be a minute.

23:39.319 --> 23:41.621
You got to have a lot
of upper body strength

23:41.654 --> 23:42.555
to hand line.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.190
Big, heavy bastard
like the tuna?

23:44.291 --> 23:45.925
You got to go arm over arm,

23:45.958 --> 23:47.460
pitch and pull,
pitch and pull,

23:47.494 --> 23:49.962
none of this rod and reel,

23:49.996 --> 23:52.832
sit back and crank shit.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.002
The Old Man and the Sea.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.304
That's me.

23:59.306 --> 24:01.007
When was the last time
you were there?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.376
Otter Banks?

24:03.410 --> 24:05.612
Ten years ago,
maybe yet.

24:05.645 --> 24:09.782
Shit. My brother
was still alive.

24:18.325 --> 24:21.461
You know what I love
about the ocean?

24:21.494 --> 24:25.197
I love how it doesn't give
a flying fuck about you.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.335
Mm. I get that.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.537
It'll swallow you up.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.873
It's big, you're small.
Deal with it.

24:41.381 --> 24:42.649
How you feeling?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.216
Better.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.653
Antibiotics are
kicking in, I think.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.892
You sure you don't want to
know my side of the story?

24:52.925 --> 24:54.994
How I got this thing?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.396
Would you tell me
the truth?

24:56.429 --> 24:58.130
Mm, well,
I could tell you,

24:58.164 --> 24:59.532
but then I'd have
to kill you.

24:59.566 --> 25:02.101
I hope that was a joke.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.537
Oh, of course it was. Hey.

25:08.608 --> 25:12.379
Like I said,
just keep me in the dark.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.448
Okay.

25:15.482 --> 25:18.084
We put tracking devices
on both their vehicles.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.552
May yield something.

25:19.586 --> 25:22.288
And Nash?
RHD have any idea?

25:22.389 --> 25:25.224
He's off the radar,
gone to ground somewhere.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.293
What do they have you doing?

25:27.394 --> 25:29.796
We're on hold,
waiting for Firearms

25:29.829 --> 25:32.799
to finish processing
the weapons from the scene.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.667
Follow the guns, huh?

25:34.701 --> 25:35.768
Yeah.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.203
That's a shit job.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.138
Yep.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.007
They're mad at you.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.810
Maybe. I think Connor suspects

25:43.843 --> 25:46.646
we were running
a parallel investigation.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.781
Maybe he blames us
for spooking Nash,

25:48.815 --> 25:50.216
setting this whole
thing in motion.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.918
It has crossed my mind.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.020
Yeah, mine, too.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.257
We were so close
to grabbing him up.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.127
So what do you think
happened?

26:01.160 --> 26:02.429
Why did Nash spook?

26:02.462 --> 26:04.597
I think somehow he knew
we'd been there,

26:04.631 --> 26:07.434
to his house,
saw those photographs.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.443
So have we heard
anything yet?

26:16.443 --> 26:18.745
I didn't want to spoil
a lovely evening.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.787
Mm.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.255
Delicious.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.924
What?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.593
Ahem.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.595
Through her family
in Yerevan,

26:35.628 --> 26:38.130
we, uh, reached
an aunt in Toronto.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.866
Do they know where
the little bitch is?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.535
She does not, but she heard
from Layla a few months ago

26:42.569 --> 26:43.903
about the wedding.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.938
Wedding.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.239
We were still married.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.775
He didn't even
have the balls

26:48.808 --> 26:50.276
to serve me
with the divorce papers.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.612
Wedding. Fuck a wedding.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.047
Did they save the date?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.883
Still in the planning stages.

26:56.916 --> 26:57.917
Hmm.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.721
To a nice Armenian
gangster twice her age.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.822
Lucky girl.

27:02.855 --> 27:06.158
The aunt said traditional
Armenian wedding.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.895
Which would mean a church.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.063
You know how many Armenian
churches there are in L.A.?

27:12.331 --> 27:14.901
Our Lady Queen of Martyrs.

27:14.934 --> 27:18.404
Tony never went to church
a fucking day in his life.

27:18.505 --> 27:21.340
Well, apparently,
Layla was very attached

27:21.373 --> 27:23.009
to this particular church.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.376
Went on and on to the aunt

27:24.410 --> 27:27.547
about how the priest
made her feel like family,

27:27.580 --> 27:30.149
made her feel welcome,
made her feel at home.

27:31.784 --> 27:32.719
Hmm.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.190
Detectives.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.526
Agent Griffin?

27:39.526 --> 27:41.327
The floor is yours.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.296
Luke Rykoff gave you
some information

27:44.330 --> 27:46.098
pertaining
to your Allen case.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.034
I assume it proved
useful.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.536
Jury's still out.

27:49.536 --> 27:51.871
We're hoping the LAPD
will return the favor.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.573
Uh, how?

27:53.606 --> 27:55.141
The death of Joey Marks

27:55.174 --> 27:56.408
provides us
with an opportunity.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.645
Now, we have
a legitimate shot

27:58.678 --> 28:01.548
at reinserting Rykoff
into the Marks organization.

28:01.548 --> 28:03.215
Now,
the three of you know

28:03.249 --> 28:05.284
that Rykoff
is an FBI agent.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.086
Anyone else?

28:07.119 --> 28:09.055
I don't think so.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.190
Okay. We need for you
to keep it that way.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.392
So there can be
no records into

28:13.425 --> 28:14.927
his true status
or identity,

28:14.961 --> 28:15.895
no conversation.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.697
We need to maintain
his legend.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.298
Okay. Consider it done.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.133
Thank you.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.334
I'll let you get
back to it.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.471
Before you go...
Martin Weiss.

28:25.572 --> 28:26.639
What about him?

28:26.673 --> 28:28.107
We ran a plate on a car

28:28.140 --> 28:30.242
parked at Veronica Allen's
home last night.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.844
It belonged to Weiss.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.479
I'd like to know
where he stands

28:33.580 --> 28:35.147
in the broader scheme
of your investigation.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.751
Up to his chin in shit.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.621
But for your case,
fair game.

28:42.589 --> 28:43.990
Have a good day.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.963
Veronica Allen and Weiss?

28:50.997 --> 28:53.099
Think she's cutting him
in on the money?

28:53.132 --> 28:55.334
She may have no choice.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.269
She's got to find it
first.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.177
Do the assistant chiefs know?

29:05.211 --> 29:06.613
As of an hour ago.

29:06.613 --> 29:09.448
We'll be holding
a press conference today

29:09.481 --> 29:11.283
to announce
his resignation.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.952
We'd like you
to be there.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.921
I'd rather not.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.756
It would look
like I'm gloating.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.357
Everyone
knows our history.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.627
I want to balance
the negative
with the positive.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.762
Announce an interim
chief at the same time.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.365
What about
Assistant Chief Lopez?

29:26.398 --> 29:27.967
He's come up
through the ranks,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.402
and it's time for a Hispanic
chief of police.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.705
Be an historic moment
for L.A.

29:32.739 --> 29:34.707
I'm a Latino mayor.

29:34.741 --> 29:37.276
I can't appoint
a Latino chief.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.278
Who, then?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.247
You.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.456
Are you trying
to co-op me, Mr. Mayor?

29:50.489 --> 29:52.258
Won't work.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.226
I'm still endorsing
your opponent.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.762
Endorse who you like.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.497
Actually, that will make
the mayor look good--

29:58.530 --> 30:00.266
above the partisan fray.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.343
Two conditions.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.645
Name them.

30:12.679 --> 30:14.446
RHD has a free hand

30:14.480 --> 30:16.282
in their investigation
into my son's death

30:16.315 --> 30:17.483
and departmental corruption.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.618
No interference from you
or anyone else.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.920
Let the chips fall
where they may.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.223
Full transparency.
You have my word.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.158
What's
your other condition?

30:27.293 --> 30:28.427
I will not be a candidate

30:28.460 --> 30:29.628
for the permanent position.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.864
And you'll
announce that today.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.734
We expected you'd want
to be considered,

30:34.767 --> 30:36.202
throw your hat
in the ring.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.503
Not interested.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.439
You have
an excellent chance

30:40.472 --> 30:41.774
with the Police
Commission.

30:41.808 --> 30:43.676
You're highly regarded
at the moment.

30:43.710 --> 30:47.046
I won't trade on the tragedy
of my son's death.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.851
Forgive me.
That's not what I meant.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.022
Of course not.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.757
Agreed.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.005
Veronica headed downtown?

31:14.306 --> 31:16.142
Still stuck on the 101.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.409
SIG Alert.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.982
We've got a case that
might involve bonds

31:23.015 --> 31:24.383
or certificates of some kind,

31:24.416 --> 31:26.152
something
that can be moved

31:26.185 --> 31:29.055
without a lot of attention
or a lot of questions,

31:29.088 --> 31:30.923
like bearer bonds.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.624
We don't
handle those here.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.126
They're disappearing.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.995
They long ago stopped
earning interest,

31:36.028 --> 31:38.798
so it's about parking
money, not earning.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.532
Our clients want to earn.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.868
Who does handle those?

31:41.901 --> 31:43.302
I think
I can put together

31:43.335 --> 31:44.937
a couple of names
for you.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.273
Bearer bonds have
a certain reputation,
you know.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.108
Drug dealers.
Money launderers.
Tax evaders.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.878
Exactly. That's not
where we want to be.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.780
We don't want those folks
sitting in our waiting room,

31:53.813 --> 31:56.348
if you know what I mean.
On the other hand,

31:56.382 --> 31:58.818
the last guy that brought
bearer bonds in here

31:58.851 --> 32:00.787
was a priest, so--

32:01.788 --> 32:02.822
Said somebody donated

32:02.855 --> 32:04.123
a quarter million in
bonds to his church.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.158
- When was that?
- Couple of weeks ago.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.559
Where'd you send them?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.261
Thurmond Bradley
Investments on Wilshire.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.364
They're not so picky
about who's in their
waiting room.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.166
- Did you catch a name?
- Sorry.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.667
I don't remember.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.336
What about the church?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.172
I don't think he ever said.

32:40.927 --> 32:44.496
Your namesake, she relieved
our Lord's suffering

32:44.530 --> 32:45.865
on his Via Dolorosa.

32:45.898 --> 32:47.033
I'm afraid I was named

32:47.066 --> 32:48.868
for the Veronica
in the comic books.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.502
You look more
like Betty to me.

32:51.838 --> 32:54.006
Oh, it is
a beautiful church.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.842
We've been here a long time.

32:55.875 --> 32:59.078
The neighborhood's changed,
but we've endured.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.279
How long?

33:00.312 --> 33:03.883
Celebrated our 60th
anniversary last year.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.853
The first Armenian Catholic
church in California.

33:06.853 --> 33:08.120
Mazel tov.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.157
What do you think?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.892
It's perfect.

33:12.925 --> 33:14.660
We'll look at the calendar.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.695
May and June book up first.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.865
Mrs. Sarkisian.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.941
Forgive me, Mrs. Allen,
but why our church?

33:28.975 --> 33:32.278
You don't look Armenian,
and your name--

33:32.311 --> 33:34.480
My late husband changed it
for business reasons.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.015
- Avakian.
- Ah.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.117
It was his wish
that our daughter

33:38.150 --> 33:40.219
have a traditional
Armenian wedding.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.122
Come to my office.
We'll look at some dates.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.425
Lovely. I noticed
you're in the middle
of a capital campaign.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.626
Yes.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.096
And I understand
that it's customary

33:50.129 --> 33:52.031
to make a donation
at the time of the wedding.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.266
Customary, not required.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.968
Perhaps
in my husband's name.

33:56.002 --> 33:58.270
That would be most generous
of you, Mrs. Allen.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.671
It would be my pleasure,
Father.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.340
Please.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.209
Father Tabakian.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.611
He gave him those bonds
for hiding her

34:05.644 --> 34:06.979
or for helping her
some other way.

34:07.013 --> 34:09.048
So let's hit
Thurmond Bradley first,

34:09.081 --> 34:10.582
then go lay it down
for Father T.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.318
Veronica off the 101 yet?

34:15.988 --> 34:18.424
Boyle Heights.
Pleasant Avenue.

34:18.457 --> 34:19.525
Queen of Martyrs.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.260
Perfect.
Two birds, one stone.

34:31.938 --> 34:34.173
Ah. There is still
one Sunday in June.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.408
I've changed my mind,
Father.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.478
You don't want
to book the wedding?

34:39.511 --> 34:42.814
And I'm actually not interested
in making a donation, either.

34:42.848 --> 34:46.418
I don't understand.
May I ask why?

34:47.686 --> 34:49.088
I'd like to talk
about a donation

34:49.121 --> 34:50.856
that was already made.

34:50.957 --> 34:52.258
I'm sorry.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.793
Ten days ago,
you cashed bearer bonds

34:54.826 --> 34:57.329
in the amount of $400,000.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.765
You received those bonds
from Liliet Saroyan,

34:59.798 --> 35:01.267
my husband's mistress.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.070
Mistress?
I'm sure you're mistaken.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.038
Those bonds belong to me.

35:06.072 --> 35:09.375
Mrs. Allen,
I know Liliet Saroyan,

35:09.408 --> 35:12.044
and I can't believe
that what you say is true.

35:12.078 --> 35:14.446
She came to you to talk
about a wedding, didn't she?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.448
She did. She said
that she and her fiancé--

35:16.482 --> 35:17.549
Is this your Liliet?

35:20.752 --> 35:23.622
Layla, yes.
But who's this?

35:23.655 --> 35:26.325
my husband.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.094
They were lovers.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.529
And the gift she gave you,
the bonds,

35:30.562 --> 35:32.498
she stole those from me.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.235
Now, you wouldn't want
to be the recipient

35:36.268 --> 35:39.338
of such a tainted gift,
would you, Father?

35:39.371 --> 35:42.108
Born of an adulterous
relationship.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.011
I don't know what to say.

35:45.044 --> 35:46.645
Where is Layla?

35:49.148 --> 35:53.019
Where is she?
And where is my money?

35:53.019 --> 35:56.355
Layla is gone.
She left the country.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.623
To where?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.158
I don't know.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.460
- I haven't heard from her.
- Liar.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.562
Please believe me.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.397
And my bonds?

36:05.431 --> 36:07.599
I'm sorry,
but I cashed the bonds.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.502
The donation she made
to the church
is in the bank.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.205
Then you will write me
a check for that amount.

36:13.239 --> 36:16.075
I'm sorry. I can't
just do that without
proof that the bonds--

36:16.108 --> 36:17.609
This is your proof!

36:17.643 --> 36:21.480
Mrs. Allen, look,
I'm sorry for your troubles,

36:21.513 --> 36:22.714
but that's not proof.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.318
I want my money.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.855
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.157
Not without my fucking money.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.624
You know,
I'm calling the police.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.226
No, you are not.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.063
Still here.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.499
Maybe they're negotiating
a settlement.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.548
I could see how she
can persuade him

36:56.582 --> 36:59.085
to give back the bonds
and tell her where Layla is.

36:59.085 --> 37:00.786
- She's got game.
- He's a priest.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.288
He's a man, isn't he?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.273
What happened?

37:22.774 --> 37:24.510
He attacked me.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.879
Where's Father Tabakian?

37:27.913 --> 37:30.549
He's-- He's--
He's in his office.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.785
I had to defend myself.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.188
- Jerry.
- I got her.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.924
I want to talk
to my lawyer.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.359
I bet you do.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.919
6 William 21.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.289
I'm code 6
at 1327 Pleasant Avenue.

38:10.322 --> 38:13.225
Requesting two units
and a supervisor, code 2.

38:13.259 --> 38:17.263
Also an RA for a white male,
50 years,

38:17.296 --> 38:19.698
unconscious
and not breathing.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.810
Take her to Hollywood.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.279
Not Hollenbeck?

38:33.312 --> 38:35.381
No, Hollywood. Our case.
You roger that?

38:50.596 --> 38:53.064
I thought I said
to hold my calls.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.467
I know, sir,
but it's your wife.

38:56.568 --> 38:57.669
Put her through.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.513
I'm happy for you.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.216
I know how much
you've wanted this

39:10.249 --> 39:12.251
and for how long.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.523
Coming under these
circumstances...

39:20.125 --> 39:22.861
tastes more like ashes
than victory.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.665
I understand that.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.969
I'm going to make right
on our son,

39:31.002 --> 39:34.105
with the full
force and authority
of this department,

39:34.139 --> 39:35.874
whatever it takes.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.811
If that brings you peace.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.481
Not you?

39:47.453 --> 39:50.689
I'm willing to give you
as much time as you need.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.692
Irv.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.234
I've hired a lawyer.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.273
Maybe you should, too.

40:12.378 --> 40:14.746
I can see the feathers
coming out of your mouths.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.149
- Lieutenant?
- The cats who ate the canary.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.885
Don't get cocky.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.420
She sets a meet
with the priest,

40:21.453 --> 40:23.689
walks out of that meeting,
blood on her hands.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.591
caught red-handed.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.960
Runs into us, we walk in,
priest is adios.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.396
Her prints are on the weapon.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.564
It's obvious
she planted the scissors

40:32.598 --> 40:33.899
from the way
they're placed.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.166
To you, maybe.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.935
And she's got $4 million
worth of motive.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.371
I have seen cases with far
more convincing evidence

40:39.405 --> 40:41.373
go down the crapper.
Do you remember OJ Simpson?

40:41.407 --> 40:43.141
You can blame the jury
for that one.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.443
That's my point exactly.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.279
- Payback for Rodney King.
- Precisely.

40:47.313 --> 40:48.947
This case is going
to be a goldmine

40:48.980 --> 40:50.215
for some slick attorney.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.552
The interviews,
book, TV deals.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.587
We're not losing
this one.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.023
Take a breath, Lieutenant.
We've got this.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.292
Famous last words.

41:00.326 --> 41:02.861
I am holding you to them,
Bosch.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.470
Hey.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.506
Will I see you later?

41:15.974 --> 41:17.976
I'll try.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.012
I've got a lot of work
I've got to catch up on, so--

41:24.350 --> 41:25.884
Hey, you know what?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.521
I'm thinking
maybe it's better

41:29.555 --> 41:30.989
you keep your
distance a few days,

41:31.022 --> 41:32.724
just till things
quiet down.

41:34.393 --> 41:35.894
Sounds smart.

41:35.927 --> 41:40.165
When I'm stronger,
we'll take a road trip

41:40.198 --> 41:42.401
cross country.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.003
Otter Banks.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.373
Why not?

41:49.508 --> 41:50.876
Sure.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.859
And if I hear
helicopters and sirens?

42:09.094 --> 42:10.629
Stay away from the news.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.221
Where's my lawyer?

42:36.254 --> 42:37.589
I've called him
three times.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.057
He doesn't
answer my calls.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.559
He doesn't return
my messages.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.127
I shouldn't even
be in here.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.429
It was self-defense.

42:43.429 --> 42:44.896
Save your story, Mrs. Allen.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.433
You're going to have a long
time to work on the details.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.169
So what happens next?

42:51.202 --> 42:53.104
When do I get my bail hearing?

42:53.138 --> 42:54.440
You're going
to be transported

42:54.440 --> 42:55.707
to the female jail
in Van Nuys.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.275
You'll have access
to a phone.

42:57.308 --> 42:58.710
You can keep trying
to reach your lawyer.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.311
If you'd like me
to call someone else

43:00.345 --> 43:03.348
to represent you,
give me a name.

43:03.449 --> 43:05.917
How about Martin Weiss?
Will he do?

43:05.951 --> 43:11.823
You're so fucking smug,
detective, so confident.

43:11.857 --> 43:14.159
Can't wait to wipe
that look off your face.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.261
I'll take that
as a no on Weiss.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.196
I'll leave a message
for Williams,

43:18.229 --> 43:20.031
let him know you're
headed to Van Nuys.

43:20.065 --> 43:21.767
Good night, Mrs. Allen.

43:35.481 --> 43:36.948
What's going on?

43:36.982 --> 43:39.217
Tenzer's out, Irving's in.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.219
- I'll be damned.
- Mm-hmm.

43:41.252 --> 43:42.821
Tough way to become chief.

43:42.854 --> 43:45.857
He inherits a whole big
steaming bowl of shit.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.528
Bosch, line 1.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.503
Bosch.

43:57.503 --> 43:59.337
I've been trying
to get hold of you.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.706
Who is this?

44:00.739 --> 44:02.307
I've been calling
and calling.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.275
Ma'am, your name.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.145
Annette McKay.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.247
Oh. Right.
You're the woman

44:09.280 --> 44:10.616
that's been talking
to Keisha Russell.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.250
You won't return my calls.

44:12.283 --> 44:14.520
I left you a message
months ago.

44:14.553 --> 44:17.055
I've been away
for a while.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.356
Do I know you?

44:18.389 --> 44:20.526
Your voice
sounds familiar.

44:20.526 --> 44:23.328
Aunt Nettie.
That's what you called me:

44:23.361 --> 44:27.132
Aunt Nettie.
Do you remember me?

44:30.168 --> 44:31.202
Harry?

44:34.540 --> 44:35.874
Harry?

44:35.907 --> 44:37.809
Aunt Nettie.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.278
Could I call you
back tomorrow?

44:40.311 --> 44:42.981
It--
It's kind of late.

44:43.014 --> 44:46.718
Come see me soon, Harry.
I don't have long.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.555
Why is that?

44:50.556 --> 44:52.724
I'm dying.

44:52.758 --> 44:54.693
Harry, I need to see you.

44:54.726 --> 44:58.964
I'll come as soon
as I can, I promise.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.799
Don't wait too long.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.235
I won't.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.705
I know who killed
your mother.
