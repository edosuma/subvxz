- Dad?
- Sorry. Texting and driving

01:14.900 --> 01:17.171
is just about one of
the dumbest things you can do.

01:17.172 --> 01:19.307
I know, and I'm never
going to do it again.

01:19.308 --> 01:20.507
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

01:20.508 --> 01:22.602
Okay, so tonight,
for my birthday,

01:22.603 --> 01:24.463
I want to have a family dinner.

Well, thank you for
reminding me, calendar police.

01:28.758 --> 01:30.608
But your father and I have
already discussed this.

01:30.609 --> 01:32.763
Yes. On birthdays
the schedule changes.

Tonight all members of this
family will be present.

He will be here. Hopefully.

(David) We have a plan. We are
all gonna be on our best behavior

01:45.025 --> 01:47.575
and he will see
how well everything's going

01:47.576 --> 01:50.219
and he will get comfortable with
the idea of coming home.

- this onion for a green onion?
- No.

very clear.

No, I don't want you
to take the fall for me.

09:59.928 --> 10:01.195

No, Tay, seriously, it's okay.

10:55.073 --> 10:55.657

what's appropriate here.

And we did. That's why
she's still grounded.

10:59.921 --> 11:02.344
Liz, I know you're afraid
when she's out of your sight.

I'm just wondering
why you never told me

18:42.212 --> 18:44.308
about what happened to your mom?

18:47.507 --> 18:49.731
Madison said that...

She was attacked and that

comes up in conversation
very easily.

anybody else does,

- I never said that!
- Mm-hmm.

29:36.484 --> 29:39.053
- Look, I was gonna say...
- Okay, here it comes.

29:39.054 --> 29:39.819
I'm trying to help you here

29:39.820 --> 29:42.809
but sometimes you make such
questionable decisions.

29:42.810 --> 29:44.035
Mom, please,
could you just stop?!

29:44.036 --> 29:46.569
- Elizabeth...
- No, just stop it, please.

29:46.570 --> 29:47.306
Elizabeth...

29:47.307 --> 29:50.928
- Elizabeth...
- Mom? Mom!

29:52.163 --> 29:53.256
Mom!

29:53.257 --> 29:54.905
Mom!

29:54.906 --> 29:56.185
David!

29:57.065 --> 29:59.305
David, I need your help!

29:59.306 --> 30:00.633
(Grant) Gammy!

30:01.137 --> 30:01.993
Oh, my God.

30:01.994 --> 30:04.097
I can't find her pulse.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.137
- Mom!
- I found it, I found her pulse.

30:11.138 --> 30:14.641
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Her pills, I think she needs her heart pills.

30:14.642 --> 30:15.385
Okay.

30:16.525 --> 30:17.999
Okay, what's... what's going on?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.474
- Hey, hey...
- What happened?

30:19.475 --> 30:20.441
You fainted.

30:20.442 --> 30:21.536
- You fainted.
- Oh, man.

30:21.537 --> 30:22.617
Let's get you to the chair.

30:22.618 --> 30:23.122
Oh...

30:23.123 --> 30:24.827
It's okay, I...

30:24.828 --> 30:26.498
I don't have...

30:28.081 --> 30:30.562
Oh, I forgot my... my pills.

30:31.889 --> 30:33.561
Here, here.

30:34.050 --> 30:35.873
Oh, honey, thank you.

30:35.874 --> 30:36.553
Maybe a bourbon?

30:36.554 --> 30:38.434
- No.
- I don't think so.

30:38.435 --> 30:40.635
- She's feeling better.
- You're so strict.

30:40.636 --> 30:42.801
I think they just want you
to be okay, gammy.

30:43.362 --> 30:45.285
Look, I'm sorry, it's my fault.

30:45.286 --> 30:47.434
I was supposed to remind you
to take your pills.

30:47.435 --> 30:49.549
Don't be silly, this is
not your responsibility.

30:49.550 --> 30:52.070
This is on me, okay?
I'm responsible here.

30:55.662 --> 30:57.526
(Crickets chirping)

30:57.527 --> 30:57.950
(Knocking)

30:59.502 --> 31:00.549
Hey.

31:00.550 --> 31:01.598
Hey.

31:02.901 --> 31:04.601
I'm happy to see you.

31:04.602 --> 31:05.702
Uh, I was gonna call you

31:05.703 --> 31:09.325
just to see
how you were feeling.

31:09.710 --> 31:11.012
I'm feeling okay.

31:11.013 --> 31:13.390
Just came
to give Madison a ride.

31:16.406 --> 31:18.521
You know, it was
a long time ago, Taylor.

31:18.522 --> 31:22.270
And my mom has never been
the same since, so I...

31:22.271 --> 31:25.984
I know what that anger
can do to you if you let it.

31:25.985 --> 31:29.678
That's why you forgave Crash.

31:29.679 --> 31:33.337
(Footsteps thumping on stairs)

31:33.338 --> 31:33.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:33.881 --> 31:35.841
- Thanks for coming.
- Mm-hmm.

31:37.457 --> 31:39.458
All right, I'll be in my truck.

31:39.459 --> 31:39.833
Okay.

31:39.834 --> 31:40.833
See you.

31:40.834 --> 31:42.570

32:20.419 --> 32:21.738
Of what?

32:21.739 --> 32:25.306
Having a family that
cares about you,

no matter what.

32:28.138 --> 32:30.734

I get that.

32:53.447 --> 32:55.531
Look, why don't you
come back inside?

32:55.532 --> 32:57.618
If there's one thing
about this family,

32:57.619 --> 32:59.670
it is that they are
very forgiving.

32:59.671 --> 33:01.374
No, I need to go.

I don't wanna do

33:07.400 --> 33:09.206
Okay.

34:00.181 --> 34:01.334
You okay?

34:01.335 --> 34:04.894
You know, I have fought with
that woman my entire life,

34:04.895 --> 34:07.702
but if something
actually happened to her,

34:07.703 --> 34:09.406
I would be a mess.

34:09.407 --> 34:12.581
Funny how life works like that.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.790
Yeah.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.530

- Hey, bud.

34:32.891 --> 34:34.315
You made a cake?

34:34.315 --> 34:35.105
Yeah, I mean,

34:35.106 --> 34:36.746
it's from a box, but, um, yeah.

34:36.746 --> 34:39.681
Oh, you made a cake.
That's so sweet, thank you.

34:40.489 --> 34:41.905
Well, I should take Joan home.

34:41.906 --> 34:45.672
Or rather I should make her
think it's her idea

34:45.674 --> 34:47.562
and then take her home.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.416
Okay, thank you for that.

34:50.873 --> 34:53.225
All right, Grant,
you almost ready?

34:54.184 --> 34:57.812
Um... I was actually thinking
of staying here tonight

34:57.813 --> 34:58.912
if it was okay.

34:58.913 --> 35:00.263
Yeah, of course.

35:00.264 --> 35:00.980
Yes, that's okay.

35:00.981 --> 35:04.550
You know, I can't ice my cake
until it cools down.

35:04.551 --> 35:07.100
And, plus, Poppop
spends a lot of time

35:07.101 --> 35:08.060
in his underwear.

35:08.061 --> 35:09.171
Oh, we're glad to hear it.

35:09.172 --> 35:12.987
Not about Poppop...
Not the underwear...

35:12.988 --> 35:13.597

35:21.179 --> 35:23.642
Well, you should have
the house tonight.

35:26.339 --> 35:30.447
So after I drop Joan off,
I'll make myself scarce.

35:30.448 --> 35:31.752
You know, David...

35:33.687 --> 35:36.303
What if you just
come back here tonight?

35:36.855 --> 35:39.167

35:39.168 --> 35:41.479

together.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.143
Okay.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.343

never-ending grounding

36:37.681 --> 36:40.944
and the idea
of getting out of here

36:40.945 --> 36:42.872
appealed to me very briefly.

36:42.873 --> 36:45.140
Well, you shouldn't even
be grounded.

36:45.695 --> 36:48.188
But did you really
wanna move out?

36:48.189 --> 36:49.043
I don't know.

36:49.044 --> 36:52.004
Madison was just this reminder

36:52.005 --> 36:54.331
of what my life used to be like.

36:54.332 --> 36:57.441
I had no rules.
I could do whatever I wanted.

completely recovered.

38:03.149 --> 38:05.012

several times

38:05.013 --> 38:05.859

38:05.860 --> 38:07.929

- Good.

39:15.536 --> 39:17.583
I know that we're hard
on you sometimes

39:17.584 --> 39:19.255
or... me specifically.

39:19.256 --> 39:22.416
I just try so hard
to protect you that

39:22.417 --> 39:24.525
sometimes I get carried away.

39:24.526 --> 39:26.636
You are a parental vise grip.

39:26.637 --> 39:28.712
But I really appreciate you.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.463
Thank you.

39:30.464 --> 39:32.463
- Yeah.
- Aww...

39:32.464 --> 39:34.352
- That was sweet.
- That was nice.

39:34.353 --> 39:36.381
I'm gonna eat more cake
just for that.

39:36.382 --> 39:38.376
- You do it.
- Now get off your phone.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.671
- Yeah.
- I'm kidding.

39:39.672 --> 39:42.308
(Cell phone alerting)
Damn, she's blowing up!

39:42.309 --> 39:44.911
I know. A day's worth
of texts and voicemails.

39:44.912 --> 39:46.459
I've never been so popular.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.562
Do you dare me
to eat the whole cake?

39:50.063 --> 39:51.414
(Taylor) You wish you
had that many friends.

39:51.415 --> 39:53.866
(Elizabeth) Ok, you eat
half I'll eat the other half

39:53.867 --> 39:55.323
- and we'll see who gets sick first.
- You wish.

39:55.724 --> 39:57.570
Remember on our wedding?

39:58.906 --> 40:01.915
(All laughing).

40:01.916 --> 40:03.050
What's up?

40:09.487 --> 40:11.623
It's about Lori.

40:11.624 --> 40:13.759
What about her?

40:17.526 --> 40:20.342
She tried to kill herself.

40:27.743 --> 40:32.801
