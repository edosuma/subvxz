00:01.760 --> 00:02.840
Previously on The O.C.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.640
There were definitely sparks between her and Carter. I was thinking we could help set them up.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.080
- How did Summer take the fact that Reed's a woman?
- I couldn't tell her, even if I wanted to.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.080
I'm working with him on his comic book.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.920
Getting rid of Caleb, I'll do it.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.840
- I said I'd help you.
- I'm gonna pay you back.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.800
SANDY: Some girl took drugs, she passed out in the pool.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.600
I gave them to her. I brought the drugs.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:29.480 --> 00:30.960
- Hungry?
- No.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.360
Me, neither.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.360
Dude, you cannot blame yourself, all right?

00:39.520 --> 00:43.200
All you did was give Trey a chance, and you believed in him. And it's like, look,

00:43.680 --> 00:47.360
- whatever he did at Marissa's party,
that's all on him.
- The thing is, I don't think he did it.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.840
I mean, Trey is a lot of things, but I don't
know. I just don't think he's a drug dealer.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.160
Okay, so then when the cops showed up and asked who's responsible for the girl floating in the pool,

00:55.320 --> 00:58.080
he was like, what? "I'm an ex-con on parole. I know, I'll say me."

00:58.200 --> 01:02.520
No. I think that when the cops showed up and went to put the cuffs on Marissa, he did what he had to do to stop them.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.800
- What makes you say that?
- I was about to do the same thing.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.680
Yeah. Sure.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.120
The compulsive need to rescue Marissa Cooper. It must be in the Atwood DNA.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.520
It would explain a lot.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.240
The good news is, if he really didn't do it, then my dad'll get him off.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.760
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.600
- I thought you'd be mad at me.
- Why would I be mad?

01:37.360 --> 01:39.680
I mean... You didn't do it, right?

01:40.160 --> 01:43.040
No, man. No way. It's just, when...

01:43.320 --> 01:45.760
I saw them about to take Marissa off,
I had to do something.

01:45.880 --> 01:50.480
And if gallantry and/or stupidity were defenses to felony dealing charges,
you'd be a free man.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.520
Here, why don't you go get settled in the pool house?

01:54.240 --> 01:59.240
- Wait, you're staying with us again?
- I... am in Sandy's custody.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.560
It's the only way he could get the judge not to lock me up.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.120
- You couldn't get him off?
- Well, you know the old expression.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.400
No good deed goes unpunished.
Trey's facing hard time.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.440
I'm going to go make some calls.

02:21.560 --> 02:25.600
- I got to do something.
- Okay, but the buddy cop thing, I mean,
that's just a metaphor.

02:25.760 --> 02:29.640
- We're not actually supposed to solve crimes
- He's my brother. I got to help him.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.080
And if that means finding the person that's really responsible...

02:32.200 --> 02:35.800
Are you thinking of going undercover in a high school sting operation?
Because that would be

02:36.120 --> 02:39.000
- very 21 Jump Street of you.
- Whatever it takes.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.200
Yeah. Okay. I get to be Richard Grieco.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.106
Oh, hey, honey. How did it go with Trey?

03:16.226 --> 03:18.786
Well, he's out of jail for the time being, but by court order,

03:18.906 --> 03:21.826
he'll be staying at the Cohen halfway house until next week's hearing.

03:21.986 --> 03:24.146
You know, that is, as long as it's okay with you.

03:24.386 --> 03:27.546
- Well, I'm guessing that he's there already.
- Back in the pool house.

03:27.706 --> 03:30.866
- Is he okay?
- Well, all things considered.

03:31.186 --> 03:34.106
Well, I guess I'll tell Carter that we can't go to Santa Barbara, then.

03:34.306 --> 03:38.346
Oh, gee, I totally forgot about that.
The wine-tasting weekend at Featherbrook.

03:38.506 --> 03:40.506
You go. I'll stay with Trey.

03:40.666 --> 03:44.306
No, no, that's no big deal. I mean, Carter can handle the vineyard story by himself.

03:44.506 --> 03:47.946
I don't think he's planning on going by himself. He told me he was thinking of asking Erin.

03:48.906 --> 03:50.826
- Erin? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:50.906 --> 03:53.746
When I mentioned that you were going to be bringing me along for the weekend,

03:53.906 --> 03:55.866
he thought it might be fun for us to go as a foursome.

03:56.346 --> 03:58.986
Well, then, all the more reason for me to stay home with you.

03:59.186 --> 04:02.466
I certainly wouldn't want to be a third wheel.

04:03.626 --> 04:05.186
Do you want a coffee?

04:06.266 --> 04:07.586
Honey? Are you there?

04:08.706 --> 04:10.706
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

04:12.706 --> 04:14.986
Hurry up, sweetie. You're going to be late for school.

04:17.266 --> 04:18.266
That's it?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.625
- Yeah, it's almost 8:00.
- Whoa. I don't get it.

04:21.866 --> 04:25.586
You trust me to have a few people over for a birthday party, it turns into a rager.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.146
Someone nearly drowns in the pool and I don't even get punished?

04:28.306 --> 04:31.146
Well, you know, it's not your fault.
These things can happen.

04:31.466 --> 04:34.706
Plus, if I punished you, I'd have to tell Caleb about it, wouldn't I?

04:34.866 --> 04:37.346
- Oh, so he's finally coming home.
- Yes, tonight.

04:37.626 --> 04:40.426
And I'm planning a special welcome home celebration for him.

04:41.586 --> 04:44.986
- Don't worry, it's a party for two.
- Gross.

04:45.346 --> 04:49.826
Personal sacrifices I have to make in order to keep a roof over our heads are nobody's business but my own.

04:49.986 --> 04:51.266
Okay, really gross.

04:51.546 --> 04:54.226
All I'm asking is that we not mention any

04:54.346 --> 04:57.506
lesbian dalliances or bodies in the pool, okay?

04:57.666 --> 04:59.466
Maybe I should stay with Summer tonight.

04:59.586 --> 05:02.786
I mean, that way you don't have to worry about me slipping up with Caleb,

05:03.026 --> 05:05.866
and you can make all the personal sacrifices you want.

05:12.306 --> 05:13.586
Hey.

05:13.866 --> 05:16.746
- Where's Cohen?
- Wouldn't know. I'm avoiding him.

05:17.026 --> 05:20.626
- Because of the Reed thing?
- Yeah, he deliberately led me to believe that she was a he.

05:20.906 --> 05:24.706
She, who happens to be cute and obsessed with his precious comic book.

05:24.866 --> 05:29.066
- Graphic novel.
- Whatever. He's turning into a subdolous egomaniac.

05:29.186 --> 05:31.906
- Subdolous.
- That's from my word-of-the-day calendar.

05:32.026 --> 05:34.746
It means sneaky and underhanded,
not to be trusted.

05:40.706 --> 05:44.466
- Oh, your ears must have been burning. Too bad they're not on fire.
- Just wait a second.

05:45.786 --> 05:48.986
This is for you. I keep the rest in a vase at my house,

05:49.146 --> 05:51.546
and every morning, I take one out and I bring it to school,

05:51.666 --> 05:54.546
just hoping that I run into you so I can apologize.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.226
That's actually kind of sweet.

06:00.346 --> 06:02.666
And to sweeten the mea culpa even a little bit further,

06:02.826 --> 06:04.586
guess who got you a ticket to Death Cab tonight?

06:05.426 --> 06:08.306
Whoa, hey. Didn't you check your email?

06:08.626 --> 06:11.986
Reed read your first draft of Atomic County.
She loved it.

06:12.786 --> 06:16.466
Well, good. I mean, that means that this graphic book thing is finally over?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.306
Not exactly. She has notes.

06:19.426 --> 06:22.386
- I thought you said she loved it.
- She does. Note-giving is just

06:22.626 --> 06:25.506
the publisher's way of showing their creative investment in a project.

06:25.706 --> 06:29.626
She wanted to do it earlier, but you know,
we had the whole school thing,
so, we're doing it later at her place.

06:32.386 --> 06:35.266
No. There's... there's Death Cab and I have

06:35.466 --> 06:37.466
you know, Summer, and, Death Cab, so...

06:38.546 --> 06:41.666
You  can't blow this off. She's been working around our schedule already.

06:44.346 --> 06:48.226
Okay, can we meet up after, I guess?
I hear they play long sets.

06:48.426 --> 06:49.986
Whatever, Mr. Subdolous.

06:53.306 --> 06:56.586
- Mr. Subdolous?
- New villain. You should pitch it to Reed tonight.

06:57.466 --> 06:58.986
See ya, buddy.

06:59.626 --> 07:03.426
Trey should have just let me get arrested.
It'd be a lot easier for Sandy to help me than him.

07:03.546 --> 07:06.986
Yeah, well, thinking before speaking is not exactly Trey's strong suit.

07:07.826 --> 07:10.066
So what can we do?

07:10.586 --> 07:13.506
Find out who brought the drugs to your party. You got any ideas?

07:14.506 --> 07:17.266
- Kyle Thompson.
- That guy? I've never seen him before.

07:18.706 --> 07:22.106
He's  a senior and a water polo player.
So you guys don't exactly run in the same circles.

07:22.546 --> 07:26.786
- But everyone says he's the guy to go to.
- Looks like floater girl knows him.

07:26.946 --> 07:31.226
Who, Jess Sathers? You know, I didn't even know she was at my party, until she nearly drowned in the pool.

07:31.626 --> 07:34.306
- So you know her?
- Uh, used to.

07:35.946 --> 07:38.946
So could you talk to her? You know, find out if Kyle's the one who hooked her up?

07:39.146 --> 07:41.146
Yeah, I can try.

07:41.386 --> 07:43.986
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

07:51.306 --> 07:52.866
Is everything okay?

07:53.786 --> 07:57.826
Yeah, just, I invited Erin up to the wine-tasting in Santa Barbara this weekend.

07:57.946 --> 08:00.466
And after a week of not hearing from her, she leaves a message saying

08:00.506 --> 08:03.386
she doesn't think it's a good idea for us to start seeing each other.

08:03.746 --> 08:05.706
- Did she say why?
- No, nothing.

08:06.866 --> 08:11.066
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me, too. I mean, I thought we hit it off really well at your dinner party.

08:11.306 --> 08:14.306
I even rented a '65 Mustang for the drive up there.

08:14.826 --> 08:17.946
- You and Sandy want to car pool?
- Actually, we're not going. You're going to have to cover the piece without me.

08:18.466 --> 08:20.586
- You're kidding. What happened?
- Family emergency.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.666
Ryan's brother needs Sandy's legal help, so he's going to be working all weekend.

08:23.866 --> 08:26.626
What about you? I mean, you can't peel away for an afternoon?

08:27.186 --> 08:29.826
Did I mention the vintage convertible?
It's red.

08:30.306 --> 08:34.226
- I wish I could.
- I'm sorry. I just... I hate drinking alone.

08:35.506 --> 08:38.866
- Well, I hate drinking wine alone.
- Me, too.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.506
All right, well, I will make sure to pick up a bottle of Featherbrook's finest.

08:44.786 --> 08:48.066
And I owe you guys a supper. So maybe we'll do that next week.

08:48.306 --> 08:51.626
- Terrific. Have a great weekend.
- You, too.

09:01.346 --> 09:03.066
Jess, hey.

09:03.666 --> 09:07.026
I just wanted to say how totally sorry I am for what happened at my party last weekend.

09:07.306 --> 09:10.226
- That was your house?
- Yeah. You okay?

09:10.586 --> 09:14.546
- Yeah, you know. Just another war story.
- Yeah, I've got a few of those.

09:15.226 --> 09:18.146
Right. I heard about your little incident in TJ last year.

09:19.746 --> 09:23.146
Not my finest moment. My parents were all over me after that.

09:24.666 --> 09:27.666
In fact, I don't really know anyone anymore

09:27.906 --> 09:30.666
and I was kind of wondering if maybe you could hook me up.

09:31.746 --> 09:33.986
A chance to party with the legendary Marissa Cooper?

09:36.266 --> 09:39.146
- Going to Death Cab tonight?
- Yeah, totally.

09:40.066 --> 09:42.826
Look for me. I might know someone.

09:44.786 --> 09:47.826
- How'd it go?
- I think it's on.

09:52.506 --> 09:54.226
I think you're right.

09:56.548 --> 10:00.028
Pick any restaurant you want.
Sort of a welcome home dinner.

10:02.348 --> 10:05.548
- They're all Thai menus.
- We didn't do a whole lot of Thai food growing up.

10:05.788 --> 10:09.668
Yeah, I'm convinced somewhere in our heritage, a Cohen bagged himself some Asian action.

10:09.988 --> 10:12.668
- Seth!
- By the way, you can't go wrong with the shrimp pad Thai.

10:12.788 --> 10:15.508
- In fact, actually, save some for me.
I've got to go.
- Where you going?

10:15.628 --> 10:18.508
I have an incredibly inconvenient note session in Silverlake.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.068
Ryan, delay Death Cab as long as you can.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.188
- Also, give one of those flowers to Summer for me, please.
- What?

10:24.428 --> 10:27.948
- You guys going out tonight?
- Yeah. But if you want to hang out when I get back?

10:28.108 --> 10:30.868
I'm the one under house arrest, Ryan.
You don't got to baby-sit me.

10:31.428 --> 10:34.468
- Hey, gang.
- Hi. Did you talk to the prosecutor?

10:34.668 --> 10:38.228
Not yet, but I found out who it's gonna be.
This guy named Tom McGinty.

10:38.588 --> 10:42.588
- So you know him?
- I know of him. He's a big Irish conservative, real letter of the law type.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.468
He's got about eight kids and six are daughters.

10:45.628 --> 10:48.788
Maybe that's a good thing. If he's a family man, maybe he'll be sympathetic to Trey.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.468
- And risk keeping a drug dealer near his daughter's school?
- I'm not a drug dealer.

10:51.788 --> 10:54.828
- Oh, I know that... but he doesn't.
- So you're saying I'm screwed.

10:55.068 --> 10:58.508
No. What I'm saying is, we're going to have to start working on your defense tonight.

11:03.748 --> 11:06.868
Thanks for making the drive. I'm sure traffic out of Newport's a bitch on Fridays.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.428
No, the drive was no problem.

11:09.508 --> 11:11.988
We're just looking forward to hearing your thoughts and concerns.

11:12.468 --> 11:14.908
- Yeah. As quickly as possible, please.
- Well, let's get started then?

11:16.148 --> 11:20.068
Okay. Overall, we're concerned about the universality of Atomic County.

11:20.188 --> 11:22.708
We're a little worried. Kids in the heartland, they're not gonna...

11:22.868 --> 11:26.788
- not gonna get this world.
- Okay. Sure. Sure. Um...

11:28.348 --> 11:31.908
except I know that, for me, Atomic's location was always sort of

11:32.148 --> 11:36.108
the backbone of the comic strip. I mean, that's why I thought you guys were interested in the first place.

11:39.228 --> 11:41.388
- We'll take a look at it.
- Okay, okay.

11:42.148 --> 11:46.148
Also, we're wondering about Cosmo Girl.
Her magic flask?

11:46.268 --> 11:49.668
Could she get her power from like,
a sports drink instead?

11:50.748 --> 11:53.348
Because Legal's worried about lawsuits from the parents of teen alcoholics.

11:54.828 --> 11:59.508
Oh, the Ironist. Boy, a little cerebral.

12:01.028 --> 12:03.228
Is he being ironic?

12:03.908 --> 12:06.108
Ooh, I gotta take this.

12:07.228 --> 12:10.108
- Who is that guy?
- Oh, Damon's a marketing genius.

12:10.228 --> 12:13.868
We just recruited him out of Phantagraphics, and he's going to make you very, very famous.

12:14.308 --> 12:16.868
As what? The worst comic book author ever?

12:17.228 --> 12:20.828
He is really good at what he does,
and the party tomorrow night is his idea.

12:20.988 --> 12:24.108
- What party?
- A party? That is awesome of you.

12:24.348 --> 12:26.868
Damon thought it would be a really good idea to introduce you to everyone.

12:27.148 --> 12:30.588
Get you with directors, musicians, animators, for your potential off-shoot projects.

12:30.988 --> 12:35.068
- Okay, that's great, but we're kind of...
- So there. Thank you.

12:35.668 --> 12:38.988
And I want you to bring your girlfriend,
'cause everyone is dying to meet
Little Miss Vixen.

12:39.148 --> 12:42.148
- Right. Little Miss Vixen's a character...
- I'll be right back.

12:44.188 --> 12:46.548
Summer's gonna kill me. I say we walk right now.

12:46.668 --> 12:49.548
- No, we've come too far to blow this.
- Even if those were good ideas,

12:49.668 --> 12:54.508
which they're not, the re-art would take me like a year, okay? I can't do that.
Summer and I would be over by then.

12:54.668 --> 12:56.708
That's why you need to bring her to the party.

12:56.868 --> 12:59.108
Make her a part of the process.
Include her in this.

12:59.308 --> 13:01.508
- You really think that's a good idea?
- Definitely.

13:05.108 --> 13:08.108
Will you tell me again about Marissa's party? I mean, who'd you talk to?

13:09.948 --> 13:12.068
Besides Ryan's friends?

13:12.468 --> 13:15.868
- I don't know. A couple girls.
- The girl in the pool?

13:16.468 --> 13:17.988
M aybe.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.108
The police report has an eyewitness claiming

13:21.268 --> 13:24.988
that she saw you and Jess enter a room
and close the door.

13:29.708 --> 13:33.388
Okay. Jess and I, we hit it off a little.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.668
You know, talked and stuff, but,

13:37.188 --> 13:40.508
truth is, I thought we were going to go back to my place and hook up.

13:40.868 --> 13:44.988
Next thing I know, the cops have arrived and she was face down in a pool.

13:45.148 --> 13:46.468
Did you see Jess take any drugs?

13:46.988 --> 13:49.748
No. But it was clear she was on them.

13:50.548 --> 13:55.108
- Where'd she get them?
- There was this one guy. I heard he was passing out pills.

13:55.588 --> 13:59.068
- You think you might recognize him?
- I-I don't, I don't know.

13:59.948 --> 14:02.148
You know, he looked like every other kid in this town.

14:02.908 --> 14:07.428
Tall, tan, and a face you just want to...
flatten.

14:08.108 --> 14:12.468
Do any of these names ring a bell?
Maybe she mentioned somebody or said something about somebody.

14:20.148 --> 14:22.588
No, look, I just wanted to help Marissa out.

14:24.068 --> 14:26.548
Nobody's ever thrown me a birthday party.

14:26.988 --> 14:29.228
I wasn't going to let her go to jail for it.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.108
I can't believe Seth is missing his favorite band.

14:46.268 --> 14:48.748
You know, it's one thing blowing me off,
but blowing off Death Cab?

14:49.108 --> 14:51.668
This comic book has totally broken him.

14:52.108 --> 14:56.068
- Have you seen Jess yet?
- Jess? Jess Sathers?
Why are you looking for that coke whore?

14:57.748 --> 14:59.628
What?! She is.

15:00.388 --> 15:04.188
- Marissa Cooper, are you doing coke?
- What? No.

15:04.748 --> 15:06.628
- No, we're...
- We're helping Trey.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.668
- Helping him what? Score?
- Stay out of prison. I'm gonna do a lap.

15:09.828 --> 15:12.668
If you see her, let me know, okay? Or Kyle.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.388
Or Seth.

15:17.028 --> 15:18.588
CALEB: Julie?

15:19.828 --> 15:23.508
- I'm up here.
- Would you come down here, please?

15:24.388 --> 15:27.068
Why don't you come up here?

15:33.308 --> 15:35.588
Welcome home, sailor.

15:37.308 --> 15:39.508
- What's all this?
- What does it look like?

15:40.228 --> 15:42.548
It looks like one of your movies.

15:44.588 --> 15:46.548
That's not funny.

15:46.748 --> 15:48.668
Not supposed to be.

15:49.868 --> 15:53.028
I spent the last few weeks trying to get past

15:53.468 --> 15:55.788
the... incident.

15:59.308 --> 16:01.068
Turns out I can't.

16:04.228 --> 16:05.708
I've missed you.

16:06.188 --> 16:08.908
After all this time, I was hoping maybe you miss me, too.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.508
Cancel whatever spa treatment you had booked for tomorrow.

16:11.748 --> 16:14.668
- We need to have a very serious discussion.
- About what?

16:15.108 --> 16:18.188
I have a meeting with my lawyers in the morning. We'll talk after that.

16:20.068 --> 16:21.668
Lawyers.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.588
- What exactly are you saying?
- I'll let my attorney talk for me.

16:36.508 --> 16:39.268
SUMMER: I mean, where, other than the Bait Shop, are tickets always plentiful

16:39.388 --> 16:43.148
and the band never too loud to talk over?
Cohen is missing it.

16:43.588 --> 16:44.988
Hello!

16:46.828 --> 16:48.908
Uh! Here comes your girl.

16:50.028 --> 16:52.428
- Oh, no. I'm blanking. Say something.
- What?

16:53.548 --> 16:55.468
Oh, my God! Jess. Hi.

16:55.668 --> 16:58.868
Remember me? Summer Roberts? We had tap and jazz together in fourth grade.

16:59.028 --> 17:01.588
- Shuffle ball change...
- Right.

17:01.908 --> 17:05.028
Don't mind my friend. She's really,
really stoned.

17:06.907 --> 17:10.108
Totally. Very, very high.

17:10.748 --> 17:12.867
Isn't this place, like, so visual?

17:14.627 --> 17:17.068
- So, you want to go sit down?
- Can't, looking for a friend.

17:17.468 --> 17:19.428
The kind who could hook me up?

17:20.867 --> 17:24.828
Actually he lost his stash last weekend,
but he's taking orders for tomorrow night.
You want in?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.907
- Definitely.
- Water Polo is throwing a party. We can meet up there.

17:28.108 --> 17:30.588
- Here's the address. Cash only.
- No problem.

17:31.708 --> 17:35.228
- How about you?
- Hmm? Oh, no, strictly ganja.

17:35.548 --> 17:38.308
Yeah, what's from the earth is of the greatest worth.

17:40.228 --> 17:43.108
- I'm going to kill you.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

17:46.188 --> 17:48.268
- How is he?
- Oh, he's scared.

17:48.428 --> 17:51.268
He's frustrated. It turns out, Trey knew the girl in the pool.

17:51.468 --> 17:53.388
The police have an eyewitness to confirm it.

17:53.548 --> 17:55.548
- That's not good.
- None of it is.

17:55.628 --> 17:59.428
I gotta keep this from going to trial, but there is no way that prosecutor will cut a deal.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.348
That's because he only knows Trey on paper.

18:06.468 --> 18:07.988
Oh, honey.

18:08.228 --> 18:10.308
- You're a genius.
- I am?

18:10.588 --> 18:12.468
Yeah, a genius.

18:13.348 --> 18:14.908
What are you working on?

18:15.068 --> 18:17.988
Notes for the wine-tasting article.
Something to keep Carter focused

18:18.228 --> 18:21.348
after his seventh pinot, since he will be attending un-chapperoned.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.388
- What happened with Erin?
- It didn't work out.

18:25.748 --> 18:28.748
Oh, that's too bad. I thought those two were a perfect match.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.468
Honey, this is gorgeous.

18:32.748 --> 18:35.868
- You should go up there with Carter.
- I should be here.

18:36.308 --> 18:39.108
Well, there's nothing you can do for Trey. He knows you're behind him.

18:40.388 --> 18:43.708
I guess, if we leave early enough, we could be back in time for dinner.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.988
I'll make the dinner... you bring the wine.

19:14.348 --> 19:16.628
Man, it's packed in here tonight.

19:18.388 --> 19:21.508
Oh, hey. Don't I know you? From that house party last weekend?

19:23.268 --> 19:25.068
- I don't think so.
- Kyle, right?

19:25.748 --> 19:29.508
That party was out of control.
I heard some chick almost OD'd in the pool.

19:31.268 --> 19:32.668
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

19:54.988 --> 19:58.268
I cannot believe I missed Death Cab.
Just kill me.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.748
Seriously, shoot me in the face.
Speaking of which, is Summer around?

20:01.908 --> 20:05.588
I need your help. I have a little...
quagmire to... un-quag...

20:06.628 --> 20:08.068
What?

20:08.988 --> 20:12.388
Oh, is that the guy?
Are you on a bust right now?

20:12.788 --> 20:15.188
Holy, dude. What can I do? Just give me a job.

20:15.308 --> 20:18.108
- Stay out of it.
- Help me. I want to help.
Really sorry about that.

20:26.588 --> 20:29.348
Well, they're not that way, 'cause that's the ocean, so...

20:37.581 --> 20:39.741
And there he is.

20:39.981 --> 20:43.541
- So what do we say?
- You say nothing. You stay right here.

20:45.341 --> 20:46.501
Big Mac.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.221
- Tom McGinty.
- Sandy Cohen.

20:49.861 --> 20:52.021
Sandy  Cohen. Why do I know that name?

20:52.141 --> 20:55.221
I've been trying to get in touch with you for the last several days from the DA's Office.

20:56.061 --> 20:58.141
I represent Trey Atwood.

21:00.061 --> 21:02.141
- What is this, an ambush?
- No, no, no, no.

21:04.021 --> 21:07.381
- I'm just hoping we can put together a deal
- The kid was caught dealing on parole.

21:07.461 --> 21:09.621
- You know something I don't?
- Yeah.

21:09.941 --> 21:13.061
- You got the wrong guy.
- We got his confession.

21:13.541 --> 21:15.461
I got eyewitnesses placing him with the girl who OD'd

21:15.661 --> 21:18.461
and the bag of ecstasy matching her tox screen recovered at the scene.

21:18.741 --> 21:20.821
- Check it for fingerprints.
- Trey.

21:21.061 --> 21:23.701
I never touched it. So my fingerprints won't be on it.

21:24.021 --> 21:27.381
You're right. No one's are. And who'd know that?

21:27.661 --> 21:30.181
- Except the guy who wiped the bag clean.
- Not another word, Trey.

21:31.861 --> 21:34.741
Two years probation, plus 100 hours of community service.

21:34.901 --> 21:37.861
That kid is looking at at least a year for the parole violation alone.

21:38.341 --> 21:40.741
None of those kids at the party have so much as a traffic ticket.

21:40.941 --> 21:44.221
So unless you've got another suspect for me, there's not going to be a deal.

21:52.021 --> 21:54.781
Except for my hair issues, great call on the convertible.

21:54.901 --> 21:57.501
Well, that's the way the California coast was meant to be seen.

21:58.101 --> 22:00.061
And your hair looks, great.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.621
Liar. For your punishment, I control the radio on the way home.

22:04.741 --> 22:08.581
No. No one who has won on American Idol ever sings in my car.

22:08.701 --> 22:12.341
Well, consider yourself lucky. If it was Sandy, you'd be listening to torch songs and show tunes.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.021
Preferable.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.861
Members of the press, honored guests,

22:18.181 --> 22:20.381
I'd like to welcome you all to my family's winery.

22:20.621 --> 22:25.861
Unfortunately, my grandfather, Chief Featherbrook, is in poor health and will be unable to join us this afternoon.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.861
Oh, that's a shame. I was hoping to get a glimpse of the old guy.

22:29.061 --> 22:31.821
I think he's a marketing gimmick, like the Jolly Green Giant.

22:31.981 --> 22:34.381
Hey, maybe we can turn this article into an expose.

22:34.501 --> 22:37.461
Our first vintage is a 2003 pinot noir...

22:37.821 --> 22:41.261
My grandfather is convinced it's what gives the grape its unique flavor.

22:41.781 --> 22:43.901
Hail to the chief.

22:47.821 --> 22:50.061
I can't believe your big apology dinner has turned

22:50.221 --> 22:53.301
into a "Make me even madder" party in Silver Hell.

22:53.461 --> 22:57.261
You know, if a cab ride home didn't cost $300, I would so be out of here.

22:57.341 --> 23:00.581
Listen, I understand that you're here on false pretenses.

23:00.781 --> 23:03.901
I was just sort of hoping that once we got here, you would try and make the best of it.

23:05.021 --> 23:07.101
- Hey, guys, come in.
- Hey.

23:08.141 --> 23:11.341
Everyone... the man of the hour has arrived.

23:11.661 --> 23:16.341
Allow me to introduce to you the architect and illustrator of Atomic County,
Seth Cohen...

23:16.501 --> 23:18.581
..his creative partner, Zach...

23:20.021 --> 23:22.781
and of course, Little Miss Vixen herself.

23:26.141 --> 23:29.901
Dude. Joe Sacho is in the kitchen right now. He wants to meet you.

23:30.421 --> 23:32.341
Of The Vixer?

23:33.301 --> 23:36.181
No, I don't know. What do you say to somebody like that? The guy's a legend.

23:36.301 --> 23:39.461
And he's a big fan of yours and he's about to leave, so...

23:40.381 --> 23:42.141
Just go.

23:47.821 --> 23:50.341
- You want to go get a drink?
- Yes.

23:59.581 --> 24:01.861
Oh, I lost track of time. You guys ready for dinner?

24:01.981 --> 24:04.621
- Actually, we need to talk to you.
- Sure.

24:05.141 --> 24:06.221
Wait, wait,

24:08.381 --> 24:12.101
No matter what happens, I just wanted to thank you for all the work you've done.

24:12.621 --> 24:16.861
Nobody's ever gone out on a limb like this for me time and time again.

24:17.901 --> 24:20.861
- I'll never forget it.
- You're talking like we're already defeated

24:22.621 --> 24:25.381
I'll admit there's a lot of work to be done,
but it ain't over till it's over.

24:25.541 --> 24:29.101
With all due respect, I was there, too.
I know I'm going down.

24:32.261 --> 24:34.061
I know things look bad

24:34.301 --> 24:37.701
- but now is not the time to give up.
- No, we're not. We...

24:38.061 --> 24:40.021
- we know who the dealer is.
- Who?

24:40.421 --> 24:44.181
- A guy at school.
- Well, we're gonna need proof.

24:44.461 --> 24:47.181
I think we can get it... tonight.

24:56.181 --> 24:58.381
Can we talk? I just need a drink.

24:58.861 --> 25:00.861
I got whisky.

25:01.421 --> 25:03.301
Make yourself at home.

25:03.461 --> 25:08.301
So, Caleb's been behind closed doors all day with his lawyers.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.861
As of tonight, it's over for me.

25:11.941 --> 25:15.021
Me and my girls are out on the street with nothing.

25:15.501 --> 25:19.301
- No pre-nup?
- I think a porn scandal more than nullifies it.

25:20.901 --> 25:24.701
Listen, Caleb's old. His health is not good.

25:24.941 --> 25:28.701
I know a guy that can get some pills.
I can switch out his medicine while you're out of town.

25:28.901 --> 25:32.141
No one will suspect a thing. Then you can live the life you deserve,

25:32.741 --> 25:36.541
and never worry about anybody taking that away from you ever again.

25:37.981 --> 25:41.341
- You're serious, aren't you?
- As a heart attack.

25:46.661 --> 25:49.741
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing you a check.

25:50.541 --> 25:53.901
- You don't got to pay me to kill your husband.
- It's not for that.

25:54.181 --> 25:56.501
It's to get you out of town.

25:58.421 --> 26:00.941
I'm not a murderer. Neither are you.

26:03.381 --> 26:05.661
I never should have come here.

26:12.541 --> 26:14.501
Good luck, babe.

26:17.501 --> 26:19.261
Good-bye, Lance.

26:24.701 --> 26:29.021
You know, they should implement the bucket concept in fast food chains.

26:29.381 --> 26:31.421
All the flavor, none of the calories.

26:32.261 --> 26:34.061
You're sick.

26:34.381 --> 26:38.661
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. We look forward to your reviews

26:41.941 --> 26:43.861
How many wines have we tasted?

26:44.101 --> 26:48.021
According to my notes... I stopped taking notes.

26:48.861 --> 26:51.901
Should we fire ourselves for drinking on the job?

26:52.101 --> 26:56.141
Drinking was the job. And I did my job really well, 'cause I'm hammered.

26:57.021 --> 26:59.061
You can't be. You have to drive.

26:59.901 --> 27:03.341
I'm not driving. Are you kidding?
With the cliffs and the ocean and the...

27:03.541 --> 27:06.261
windy roads? No way. You drive.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.661
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't drive.

27:08.821 --> 27:12.301
I have had as much to drink as you have
and I'm half the si...

27:12.821 --> 27:15.661
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Point well taken. Yeah.

27:16.541 --> 27:19.341
Excuse me? It's okay. It'll be all right.

27:19.581 --> 27:22.621
Could you uh, possibly find a driver for us tonight?

27:23.061 --> 27:25.541
We failed to make proper use of the silver bucket.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.861
- Are you staying locally?
- No, Orange County, actually.

27:29.661 --> 27:33.901
I'm sorry. But I could offer you a guest suite if you'd like to stay here tonight.

27:36.101 --> 27:39.101
What do you think? Should we expense it?

27:40.261 --> 27:43.501
I guess we don't have a choice.

27:57.188 --> 27:59.348
- Whose list are you on?
- Jess's. Marissa Cooper.

27:59.628 --> 28:01.828
- You on Jess's list, too?
- No.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.668
Then you can't come in. Sorry, dawg.

28:10.708 --> 28:13.228
Meet me around the side of the house.

28:53.849 --> 28:56.449
This really is the dark side.
Any sign of Kyle?

28:56.729 --> 28:59.369
No, but he probably shouldn't see you here.

29:00.449 --> 29:01.849
Come here.

29:19.569 --> 29:22.769
Hey, Marissa! Oh, my God, you came!

29:23.329 --> 29:27.329
- You look so beautiful tonight.
- Thanks. You're in a good mood.

29:27.609 --> 29:29.769
- Candy flipping.
- Candy flipping?

29:29.929 --> 29:33.849
Yeah, ecstasy and mushrooms.
Good for the body and the mind.

29:34.289 --> 29:37.729
- Sounds perfect.
- Come with me, girly girl.

29:51.049 --> 29:53.729
Where have you been? We had plans to talk.

29:55.569 --> 29:58.289
I'm here now. Let's talk.

29:58.649 --> 30:02.329
Are you sure you don't want to shower or something?

30:03.689 --> 30:07.449
You may not believe this but I put everything I had into this marriage.

30:08.209 --> 30:11.409
- I wanted it to work just as much as you did
- Oh, I doubt that.

30:12.209 --> 30:15.729
No one hates to fail more than I do.
But here we are.

30:16.689 --> 30:20.449
Just say it, Caleb. You want a divorce.

30:30.209 --> 30:32.649
These real tears?

30:36.009 --> 30:38.769
No one's more surprised than me.

30:41.129 --> 30:45.049
All right, then. We'll give it one more chance.

30:45.569 --> 30:48.969
- What?
- While standing here, I realize I still have feelings for you.

30:51.449 --> 30:54.369
I owe it to both of us to explore that.

30:57.249 --> 30:59.409
I don't know what to say.

30:59.689 --> 31:01.609
"Thank you," I suppose.

31:03.409 --> 31:06.689
Put on something nice. I'll take you to dinner.

31:16.329 --> 31:18.969
- It's ruined. I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

31:19.609 --> 31:23.849
- Shall we drink to its demise?
- It defeats the purpose of sobering up, doesn't it?

31:24.289 --> 31:26.969
Yeah. But there's a mini bar.

31:29.209 --> 31:30.729
I should call Sandy.

31:33.569 --> 31:37.209
And I should take a shower. I smell like a fermented grape.

31:48.849 --> 31:52.129
I have a confession. I was going to take off tonight...

31:53.009 --> 31:55.329
get out of town, never look back.

31:55.929 --> 31:59.169
All legal problems of this nature have a way of resurfacing.

31:59.329 --> 32:01.169
The only way to deal with them is head on.

32:01.449 --> 32:03.929
- Yeah, that's what Ryan said.
- He's a smart kid.

32:06.489 --> 32:10.529
- Yeah, you all right?
- I'm sorry I didn't call earlier. I couldn't get a signal at the winery.

32:10.769 --> 32:12.089
That's okay. You guys on the road?

32:12.329 --> 32:15.809
Neither of us are actually in the right shape to drive just yet, so...

32:16.209 --> 32:18.849
A little too much Indian spirit, huh?

32:19.569 --> 32:21.689
- Well, drive back in the morning.
- Are you sure?

32:21.849 --> 32:26.689
Yeah, I mean, it's not worth dying over.
I don't want either of you behind the wheel if you've been drinking.

32:28.329 --> 32:30.409
I love you.

32:38.409 --> 32:40.729
You know, I've got to tell you something.

32:41.449 --> 32:46.009
I don't know too many men who'd let their wives spend the night with another guy, no less suggest it.

32:46.569 --> 32:49.009
How many men you know have been married for 20 years?

33:03.929 --> 33:06.489
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Oh, you're not. It's fine.

33:06.609 --> 33:09.249
I was able to locate a car if you still needed one.

33:11.129 --> 33:13.249
That's... Can I call you?

33:13.529 --> 33:17.649
- Certainly. The number's on the back if you'd like to call directly.
- Thank you.

33:22.449 --> 33:27.049
DAMON: No, I just think that the cross-promotional opportunities for Atomic County are endless.

33:27.369 --> 33:31.289
- We're talking fast-food tie-ins,
action figures, NASCAR.
- NASCAR?

33:31.409 --> 33:34.649
Kids are really into body sprays these days. I'm thinking a different scent for each character.

33:35.089 --> 33:37.609
It's never too early to start developing multimedia franchises.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.969
Right. What do you mean?

33:40.169 --> 33:43.569
- Atomic County online. Video games.
- My own video game?

33:43.649 --> 33:47.689
This time next year, why not an Atomic County TV show?

33:50.569 --> 33:53.089
- Ooh, that's not so bad.
- I need to talk to you.

33:53.249 --> 33:56.329
Wait, one second...
Are you talking about, like, animation, or are you talking about live action?

33:56.809 --> 33:59.649
- Why not a hybrid?
- Why not a hybrid?

34:00.329 --> 34:02.449
- Okay, wait, one second.
- No, you did not just give me the finger.

34:02.609 --> 34:04.609
I didn't give you the finger.

34:05.009 --> 34:07.649
- Seth, I want to go home, now.
- Why, are you not having fun?

34:07.769 --> 34:09.728
No, I'm not. These people are annoying.

34:09.969 --> 34:13.849
They think that they are so smart and they are so cool with their messy hair and their dirty clothes

34:14.009 --> 34:17.129
that they bought that way. They play their retro board games

34:17.329 --> 34:19.889
and they drink wine for fun... ew.

34:20.929 --> 34:24.569
I'd like to make a toast. To Seth and his subversive vision

34:24.809 --> 34:27.609
and those that inspire it, the real Little Miss Vixens of the world.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.849
God save us all.

34:31.809 --> 34:33.409
It's fun. It's a good time.

34:34.728 --> 34:38.089
Summer, I don't see what you're so mad about. You didn't make any effort.

34:38.248 --> 34:40.489
- They've asked you, like, five times to join the conversation.
- Hey, Zach.

34:40.728 --> 34:42.728
- Can I have a ride home?
- Yeah, sure.

34:43.489 --> 34:45.728
- Thank you.
- Zach, what are you doing?

34:46.409 --> 34:48.168
Good-bye, Cohen.

34:48.649 --> 34:50.289
- Seth, we need you.
- Summer?

34:53.609 --> 34:56.688
- Come on, we're playing board games.
- I smell a tie-in.

34:56.809 --> 34:59.289
- No, stop it.
- Right?

34:59.369 --> 35:01.289
- Let's go, everybody.
- What board games are we playing?

35:01.449 --> 35:03.409
Come on! We're going to the board room.

35:05.129 --> 35:08.289
Nothing like five-star water pressure.

35:10.769 --> 35:14.769
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just, it's a little, it's the wine

35:17.889 --> 35:22.249
There's a hers bathrobe and some fuzzy slippers in the closet.

35:22.889 --> 35:25.249
Do you want to take a shower?

35:29.089 --> 35:30.769
Carter...

35:34.809 --> 35:36.529
They found a car for us.

35:41.769 --> 35:44.089
Well, that's a good thing, right?

35:45.649 --> 35:47.649
I need to go home.

35:51.129 --> 35:53.249
Yeah. Okay.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.449
I'll go get dressed.

36:18.289 --> 36:20.049
What's happening?

36:20.209 --> 36:22.449
They're outside talking.

36:24.609 --> 36:26.329
Open your hand.

36:26.489 --> 36:28.489
One at a time. And drink tons of water.

36:29.369 --> 36:31.929
Oh, and stay away from the GHB on this.
Trust me.

36:32.129 --> 36:35.849
- It's $80, right?
- Kyle thinks you're cute, so he only wants $60 and an introduction.

36:36.609 --> 36:38.609
Come on.

36:46.889 --> 36:51.209
Ryan? Reinforcements are on their way. You be careful.

36:53.569 --> 36:56.209
- What did he say?
- We're on.

37:09.809 --> 37:11.649
I just wanted to thank you for hooking me up

37:13.249 --> 37:16.689
- But I kind of have a boyfriend, so...
- I kind of don't care.

37:18.489 --> 37:21.689
Hey! Back off, man. She's with me.

37:21.969 --> 37:25.689
You need to get out of here, bitch.
This is a private party.

37:25.769 --> 37:27.489
I hope you enjoyed it.
It's probably gonna be your last.

37:29.689 --> 37:32.049
- Go back inside.
- You're a narc?

37:53.369 --> 37:55.449
- This the kid you saw last week?
- Yeah, that's him.

37:56.489 --> 37:58.889
- You all right?
- I'm kind of getting used to it.

38:05.169 --> 38:08.209
- You're under arrest for possession of a controlled substance with intent...
- Whose is that?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.969
- That's not mine.
- You have the right to remain silent...

38:10.089 --> 38:12.609
- ..and will be used against you...
- No, he planted it on me! That kid's a liar!

38:12.769 --> 38:16.729
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you by the State of California.

38:17.409 --> 38:19.529
I'll file a motion to dismiss all charges on Monday.

38:19.769 --> 38:23.209
- Thanks for doing this, Tom.
- Thanks for ambushing me.

38:26.609 --> 38:28.689
Are you guys ready to go home?
It's past my bedtime.

38:28.849 --> 38:32.969
- Actually, I was kind of hoping to spend the night at my own place tonight.
- We can drop you off.

38:35.649 --> 38:37.409
Mr. Cohen?

38:46.049 --> 38:47.689
All right.

38:49.009 --> 38:52.049
- Thanks, little brother.
- Nah, Marissa's the one who deserves the credit for this.

38:52.849 --> 38:55.209
Let's just call it even.

39:09.929 --> 39:12.969
So... Been a while,

39:15.009 --> 39:17.089
- since we were...
- Alone?

39:17.249 --> 39:19.409
- Yeah, without, something...
- Or someone.

39:19.689 --> 39:23.689
- I guess we can do whatever we want.
- Well, what do you want to do?

39:46.929 --> 39:48.569
Ryan, wait.

39:49.369 --> 39:52.129
We've waited a really long time for this.

39:52.609 --> 39:55.489
- You want to stop?
- No, I just...

39:56.609 --> 40:00.529
I think we can do better than the front seat of Sandy's car.

40:02.769 --> 40:06.609
- I know a guy who has a pool house all to himself.
- You think he'd let us borrow it?

40:08.169 --> 40:10.089
Oh, yeah.

40:25.729 --> 40:28.489
- What are you doing here?
- I think you have some idea.

40:28.689 --> 40:31.209
Yeah, breaking and entering.

40:33.849 --> 40:37.089
- How do you know I'm not working for the cops?
- I asked around.

40:38.049 --> 40:40.729
- You really are just out of jail.
- And I'm not looking to go back.

40:41.289 --> 40:44.609
So you took the fall for Marissa Cooper and then did what you had to do.

40:47.089 --> 40:49.809
The only thing I can't figure out is why you didn't turn me in, too.

40:50.129 --> 40:52.809
The cops are only looking for one suspect.

40:52.969 --> 40:55.609
And I figured you had a rough enough week as it was.

40:57.729 --> 40:59.649
And besides...

41:01.049 --> 41:03.809
- I like talking to you.
- Yeah?

41:04.569 --> 41:06.929
Well, I like talking to you, too.

41:07.569 --> 41:11.689
And now with Kyle out of the picture,
I think we have a lot more to talk about.

41:15.609 --> 41:17.769
You interested?

41:20.649 --> 41:22.729
I'm definitely interested.
