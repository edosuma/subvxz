<b>2x07 - Crossfire</b>

00:05.354 --> 00:07.965
<i>If it pleases you, Lord Megatron,</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:10.789
once Soundwave discovers
a means of decoding

00:10.858 --> 00:15.225
the remainder of the Iacon
database, as we know he will,

00:15.294 --> 00:19.030
I would suggest the deployment
of an underutilized asset.

00:19.099 --> 00:22.367
And what asset would that be,
Airachnid?

00:22.436 --> 00:25.570
I believe that my superior
tracking skills would expedite

00:25.638 --> 00:28.405
your quest to recover the
remaining relics.

00:28.474 --> 00:30.073
Noted.

00:30.642 --> 00:34.543
You are a gracious audience,
My Lord.

00:34.612 --> 00:36.382
Soundwave.

00:40.451 --> 00:44.018
Remind me of her trustworthiness.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.886
<i>I believe we must consider</i>

00:45.954 --> 00:50.891
<i>the possibility of a future...
without Megatron.</i>

00:55.261 --> 00:56.728
<i>Dreadwing.</i>

00:57.497 --> 01:00.432
I am at your beck and call,
Lord Megatron.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.701
<i>I wish to entrust you with a task</i>

01:02.770 --> 01:05.870
<i>I would normally reserve for myself.</i>

01:05.939 --> 01:08.472
<i>That is, if you wish to 
prove yourself worthy</i>

01:08.541 --> 01:11.074
<i>of becoming my 1st lieutenant.</i>

01:11.143 --> 01:13.576
That post belongs to Airachnid.

01:13.645 --> 01:16.412
<i>She will be missed.</i>

01:16.780 --> 01:19.648
<i>And I suggest you bring backup.</i>

01:19.717 --> 01:26.221
<i>She can be a handful, especially
when cornered.</i>

Am I the only one here who considers this 
to be overkill on Lord Megatron's part?

02:25.471 --> 02:29.406
I mean, dispatching two of his
most proficient warriors

02:29.415 --> 02:32.744
to track down one unconfirmed
Energon spike.

02:34.713 --> 02:38.116
Megatron knows me and Dreadwing here
will get the job done.

02:38.184 --> 02:42.019
Actually, I was referring to
Dreadwing and myself.

02:43.456 --> 02:47.658
Breakdown, remain on task.
This must be a unified effort.

02:47.677 --> 02:51.695
Indeed, Breakdown.
I know we've never seen eyes to eye,

02:51.964 --> 02:56.132
but that doesn't mean we
can't patch things up.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.534
That's it!

02:57.533 --> 02:58.534
Don't!

03:01.140 --> 03:03.074
Aah!

03:44.650 --> 03:47.518
Breakdown, don't be a fool.
Release me.

04:08.074 --> 04:11.342
Easy prey.

04:33.633 --> 04:38.335
Breakdown, what is your status?
Breakdown!

04:53.085 --> 04:56.355
MECH 1 to Silas.
Our maneuvers have yielded

04:56.423 --> 05:01.761
unexpected results...
and a familiar face.

05:04.332 --> 05:06.131
How is it that I have been

05:06.200 --> 05:13.172
reduced to seeking Energon
scraps merely to survive?

05:13.240 --> 05:17.343
Ugh!

05:34.094 --> 05:38.031
An Insecticon on Earth?

05:38.100 --> 05:43.271
You there, scavenger,
deliver that Energon to me.

05:46.676 --> 05:51.245
You dare turn your back on
a superior life-form?

05:51.314 --> 05:56.584
I am commander Starscream.

05:56.652 --> 05:59.253
Aah!

06:11.833 --> 06:15.203
Fine! Keep the Energon.

06:15.204 --> 06:18.573
I hope you choke on it.

06:33.790 --> 06:40.062
Yes, minion, approach me.
Obey me.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.368
Worship me.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.614
You shouldn't have.

06:57.683 --> 07:04.421
What?! You reject a commander but
grovel at the feet of that wretch?

07:04.490 --> 07:08.225
Starscream. Don't get your
turbines in a twist.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.261
After all, the beast and I are
somewhat related.

07:11.330 --> 07:15.934
You might even say we are of...
one mind.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.436
Why are you here?

07:17.504 --> 07:20.572
Decepticons never return to
stripped mines.

07:20.641 --> 07:25.944
You are not the only rogue
Decepticon in need of Energon.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.380
Was it a run-in with the Autobots?

07:28.449 --> 07:31.717
Or did Megatron invite you on
one of his field trips?

07:31.786 --> 07:35.888
Megatron was otherwise engaged.

07:35.957 --> 07:38.724
But you should see his lackey.

07:38.793 --> 07:43.128
You know, Airachnid,
as fellow outcasts, we should

07:43.197 --> 07:46.565
consider putting aside our differences.

07:46.634 --> 07:51.503
With this creature under your
control and at our disposal,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.839
we might employ it to terminate

07:53.908 --> 07:59.579
Megatron, allowing us to rule
the Decepticons.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.646
Together?

08:00.715 --> 08:04.950
We would simply need to lure
Megatron here, away from his

08:05.019 --> 08:08.988
support systems, so that we
might catch him...

08:09.057 --> 08:13.526
With his guard down?
An intriguing proposal...

08:13.594 --> 08:17.563
If ruling Decepticons or
spending any length of time with you

08:17.632 --> 08:20.633
were of the slightest interest to me.

08:21.803 --> 08:25.139
Of course, you had me at
"terminate Megatron."

08:25.207 --> 08:28.309
Payback would be sweet.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.912
However you wish to spin it.

08:30.980 --> 08:35.650
I would need to ensure
my assassin is up to the task.

08:35.719 --> 08:38.620
Perhaps a test run is in order.

08:38.688 --> 08:42.657
What?
I thought we were partners.

08:42.726 --> 08:44.492
Eviscerate him.

08:47.230 --> 08:48.096
Aah!

08:56.648 --> 08:58.015
What is it? 

08:58.083 --> 09:02.587
A high-frequency signal
with an embedded message.

09:02.655 --> 09:03.588
Again?

09:03.858 --> 09:05.857
Starscream.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.792
"I have obtained information

09:07.861 --> 09:14.766
of extreme interest to you.
Bring medical kit."

09:21.992 --> 09:23.859
Clear!

09:29.666 --> 09:30.899
Make it fast.

09:30.968 --> 09:35.605
It would appear that, like myself,
Airachnid has gone rogue.

09:35.673 --> 09:37.440
What's it to us?

09:37.509 --> 09:42.112
She is planning to retaliate
against Meg...

09:42.181 --> 09:45.116
Eh... mankind.

09:45.185 --> 09:49.086
I can provide you with her current location.

09:49.155 --> 09:52.723
- I don't believe you.
- Why wouldn't you?

09:52.792 --> 09:56.159
I directed you to the location
of the decepticon space bridge

09:56.228 --> 09:59.729
so you could rescue Orion Pax, didn't I?

09:59.797 --> 10:03.765
Yeah, but then you helped
M.E.C.H. steal Bumblebee's T-cog.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.301
So?
He got it back, didn't he?

10:10.374 --> 10:15.378
I admit... aligning myself
with those vile humans was

10:15.446 --> 10:19.449
a colossal error in judgment,
but I am alone.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.452
I do what I must to survive.

10:23.189 --> 10:29.961
But I have paid the price.
I am now the one missing his T-cog.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.963
You're grounded?

10:32.032 --> 10:36.135
Thus of little, if any, threat to you.

10:36.203 --> 10:40.305
But Airachnid and
her Insecticon intend to...

10:40.374 --> 10:44.509
- An Insecticon?! Here?
- How?

10:44.578 --> 10:48.947
Well, I would have asked, but
I was too busy squeezing through

10:49.016 --> 10:53.785
a narrow crevice, trying to keep
the vermin from chewing my leg off!

10:53.854 --> 10:57.824
While Airachnid watched.

10:57.892 --> 11:00.093
<i>The reason for our inability</i>

11:00.162 --> 11:03.597
to locate Breakdown's signal is
all too clear.

11:03.666 --> 11:09.103
But how is it that you were
unable to recover his remains?

11:09.573 --> 11:11.938
What is it?

11:12.007 --> 11:14.541
<i>Heard from Breakdown lately?</i>

11:14.610 --> 11:16.843
Trace the communication.

11:16.912 --> 11:18.578
<i>Megatron, truly.</i>

11:18.647 --> 11:22.616
<i>You sent simple henchman
to terminate a high-ranking officer.</i>

11:22.685 --> 11:26.186
<i>I thought you reserved that
honor for yourself.</i>

11:26.255 --> 11:29.122
Is that a challenge?

11:29.191 --> 11:31.424
<i>An invitation.</i>

11:31.493 --> 11:32.859
<i>And since Soundwave is, no doubt,</i>

11:32.927 --> 11:36.895
<i>tracing this signal, you
know where to find me.</i>

11:36.964 --> 11:39.899
I'll be back.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.901
Allow me to accompany you.

11:42.969 --> 11:46.170
You already had your chance.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.047
The coordinates Starscream provided are 

11:56.116 --> 11:59.117
within an abandoned
decepticon mine.

11:59.186 --> 11:59.951
Hold on.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.854
You just fixed him up and sent
him on his way?

12:04.157 --> 12:06.657
What were we supposed to do?
Take him back here?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.528
Not that I wouldn't jump at
any chance to put Airachnid down,

12:09.596 --> 12:12.798
but she isn't the only one
who's robbed me of a partner.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.569
You weren't there, Arcee.
Starscream was weak, defenseless.

12:16.637 --> 12:20.439
And learning of the Insecticon
could prove highly tactical.

12:20.508 --> 12:23.876
Starscream's intel has proved
credible in the past.

12:23.945 --> 12:26.979
Sure, when he wasn't busy
stabbing us in the back.

12:27.048 --> 12:30.916
Without the resources we
possessed on Cybertron, we lack

12:30.985 --> 12:34.653
ready means of capturing and
imprisoning our enemies.

12:34.722 --> 12:36.755
Nonetheless, I do not condone

12:36.824 --> 12:41.927
the termination of any
defenseless life-form.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.779
You don't waste time.

12:59.847 --> 13:03.915
Your stay of execution has
come to an end.

13:12.926 --> 13:17.530
I will leave you two to get
acquainted.

13:18.599 --> 13:24.369
Bow before Megatron, your leader.

13:24.438 --> 13:26.304
I said, "bow..."

14:25.522 --> 14:29.022
You and your beast would do well
to remember... 

14:29.038 --> 14:33.763
I honed my skills in the pits of Kaon!

14:48.647 --> 14:51.314
Proceed with extreme caution.

15:02.523 --> 15:04.857
Finish him!

15:04.926 --> 15:07.494
Whoa.
Scream never mentioned Megatron.

15:07.562 --> 15:11.304
It would seem Starscream
orchestrated this convergence

15:11.513 --> 15:17.470
in the hope that all his enemies
would destroy each other on his behalf.

15:17.539 --> 15:19.238
And I fell for it.

15:19.307 --> 15:21.341
Well, you can have whatever's
left of Megatron.

15:21.410 --> 15:24.343
- Airachnid's mine.
- Arcee! No!

15:34.955 --> 15:37.558
Aah!

15:39.627 --> 15:41.395
You.

16:03.747 --> 16:07.017
So many surprises, today.

16:54.799 --> 17:00.992
Let that be a warning to anyone
who dares cross a gladiator of Kaon,

17:01.089 --> 17:04.301
be they Decepticon...

17:07.358 --> 17:09.580
or Autobot.

17:17.424 --> 17:22.359
It would seem that I'm unarmed
and at your mercy.

17:22.428 --> 17:28.600
So, tell me, Optimus.
Do you intend to take me alive?

17:28.668 --> 17:32.537
Or end this here and now?

17:46.049 --> 17:48.150
The surprises never cease.

17:54.925 --> 17:57.093
Oh, scrap.

18:06.304 --> 18:08.739
Scrap!

18:16.815 --> 18:20.984
This may not be the day that
I take Megatron's spike,

18:21.053 --> 18:23.654
but it is the day I remove yours.

18:23.722 --> 18:25.589
Whoa!

18:29.494 --> 18:33.129
How right you were, Airachnid.

18:33.198 --> 18:35.898
Payback is sweet.

18:46.544 --> 18:50.814
Deliver Megatron to us,
and I will allow you to live.

18:50.883 --> 18:54.251
Never trust a Con.
Kick buckethead's bucket!

18:58.457 --> 19:02.828
Dreadwing, do I have your word?

19:25.017 --> 19:27.722
My liege.

19:29.791 --> 19:34.226
Dreadwing may have given you his
word, but I did not.

19:34.295 --> 19:36.429
Destroy them!

19:43.170 --> 19:47.674
You disobeyed my orders in
following me here.

19:47.743 --> 19:52.546
You will make a fine 1st lieutenant.

20:05.526 --> 20:08.129
That was intense.

20:08.198 --> 20:14.233
Now, if there's one thing I
despise nearly as much as eight-leggers,

20:14.301 --> 20:18.239
it's two-wheelers.

20:18.308 --> 20:21.242
Go on.
Get it over with.

20:21.311 --> 20:24.379
As I recollect, in a similar

20:24.448 --> 20:29.551
predicament, you once allowed
me to live.

20:35.258 --> 20:37.392
Consider us even.

20:37.461 --> 20:40.930
<i>Arcee, what is your status?</i>

20:40.998 --> 20:43.816
In need of assist, but alive.

20:43.817 --> 20:45.834
<i>And so is Airachnid.</i>

20:45.903 --> 20:50.471
At least Megatron took care
of the other bug problem.

20:55.978 --> 21:01.416
Starscream, I vow
I will have your head.

21:25.205 --> 21:29.909
So, my warrior was merely a scout.
