<i>A few years back</i>

00:03.786 --> 00:04.888

00:04.926 --> 00:06.644

00:06.728 --> 00:08.729
<i>There was a big scandal.</i>

00:11.116 --> 00:14.068

00:14.136 --> 00:17.405
<i>My boss lost his job</i>

00:17.456 --> 00:21.242
<i>Finally, I got my job back,</i>

00:21.310 --> 00:23.844
<i>but now my name was out there,</i>

00:23.912 --> 00:27.315
<i>and that's when I started</i>

00:27.382 --> 00:30.084
<i>Letters</i>
<i>from all over the country,</i>

00:30.152 --> 00:32.953
<i>all over the world,</i>

00:33.005 --> 00:35.789

00:35.841 --> 00:39.093
<i>More letters</i>
<i>than I could possibly read.</i>

00:39.144 --> 00:41.896
<i>More letters</i>
<i>than I could possibly answer.</i>

00:41.963 --> 00:43.964
Hey.

00:44.032 --> 00:47.068
I'm only one person.

00:47.135 --> 00:50.905
Hey. I can't breathe!

00:53.041 --> 00:55.009
Oh. Hey, you okay?

00:55.043 --> 00:56.944
Need some water
or something?

00:57.012 --> 00:59.880
I don't know.
No, I'm okay.

00:59.948 --> 01:02.649
I just had a dream.
I just had a ridiculous dream.

01:02.701 --> 01:04.001
It was about the mail.

01:04.086 --> 01:06.987
Any particular male?

01:07.055 --> 01:09.156
No, dear.

01:09.224 --> 01:12.960
You're the only male
I ever dream about.

01:13.028 --> 01:15.963
Good answer. Feel free
to keep dreaming.

I don't get it.

You applied

but you have to go all the way

02:37.289 --> 02:41.358
The guy I'm interviewing with
went to law school here,

02:41.426 --> 02:42.693
but he works there.

02:42.761 --> 02:44.528
Devalos knows him.

02:44.596 --> 02:46.564
I'm just lucky
that he could set it up.

02:46.615 --> 02:48.733
Joe, have you seen
the travel iron?

02:48.784 --> 02:52.169
Um, actually, I think that
I may have brought it with me

02:52.237 --> 02:53.537
when I flew to Houston
for that conference.

02:53.605 --> 02:54.905
You look on the top shelf
of the closet?

02:54.973 --> 02:57.174
No, I haven't looked
on the top shelf.

02:57.242 --> 02:59.460
That must be your other wife.

02:59.544 --> 03:02.663
This wife has never even seen
the top shelf.

03:02.781 --> 03:03.881
Hey.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.049
I know you're busy,

03:05.117 --> 03:06.550
solving the world's
energy problems,

03:06.618 --> 03:08.052
but can I just
borrow your tallness,

03:08.120 --> 03:09.220
so I can finish packing?

03:09.287 --> 03:11.822
Okay, fine, fine.

03:15.894 --> 03:17.762
Okay.

03:17.813 --> 03:19.797
"Banana."

03:19.848 --> 03:21.098

You're on a roll here.

"...U..."?

03:30.275 --> 03:34.311
If anyone asks,
you're an only child.

03:34.379 --> 03:37.081
<i>Hey, you gonna miss me?</i>

03:37.149 --> 03:38.649
No.

03:38.717 --> 03:40.451
Of course
I'm going to miss you.

03:40.502 --> 03:43.320
It's one night,
and truthfully,

03:43.371 --> 03:45.422
I'm looking forward
to burying myself in work.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.957
Really?

03:47.025 --> 03:50.494
Really. We're bidding on a
Department of Defense contract

03:50.545 --> 03:53.197
in the next few days, and I have
to come up with an algorithm

03:53.265 --> 03:55.833
that will show that we can
synthesize corn fuels

03:55.901 --> 03:57.968
more efficiently
than anyone else.

03:58.019 --> 03:59.937
That's easier to do
when I'm not around?

04:00.004 --> 04:02.706
Bury myself in work,
bury myself in you.

04:02.774 --> 04:03.908
Tough choice.

04:03.975 --> 04:04.942
You going to miss me?

04:05.009 --> 04:06.410
What's your name again?

04:06.478 --> 04:08.612
Mom? Dad?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.397
Someone taking us to school?

04:10.482 --> 04:11.682
That's me. Dad.

04:11.733 --> 04:12.850
The one with
the second billing.

04:12.918 --> 04:15.402
Hmm. Dad. Nice
to meet you.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.872
It's nice
to meet you.

04:17.956 --> 04:19.490
Hey.

04:21.543 --> 04:23.327
Miss Dubois?

04:23.378 --> 04:25.663
Excuse me, Miss Dubois?

04:25.714 --> 04:28.599
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.301
No, we've never really met.

04:30.368 --> 04:31.969
Although
I've written you many times.

04:32.037 --> 04:33.404
Jeremy Haas.

04:34.906 --> 04:37.741
You don't know who I am.

04:37.809 --> 04:40.511
I've been writing you letters,

04:40.579 --> 04:43.731
once, twice a week for
almost two years now.

04:43.815 --> 04:47.184
Well, you have
to understand, Mr., uh...?

04:47.252 --> 04:50.154
Haas, but you can
call me Jeremy if you want.

04:50.222 --> 04:53.691
Jeremy, I don't really see a lot
of the mail that I get here,

04:53.758 --> 04:54.859
especially if it's sent here.

04:54.926 --> 04:57.394
I mean, security...

04:59.364 --> 05:01.999
How-how can I help you?

05:02.067 --> 05:03.667
It's my wife.

05:03.735 --> 05:06.203
She's missing, two years now.

05:06.271 --> 05:09.006
She was eight months pregnant
when she disappeared.

05:09.074 --> 05:12.243
That's horrible. That really
sounds like a police matter.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.578
You would think.

05:14.629 --> 05:17.748
The thing is, they don't believe
she disappeared.

05:17.816 --> 05:19.850
They think she ran away.

05:19.918 --> 05:23.020
She kind of left a note.

05:23.088 --> 05:24.488
I know how it sounds,

05:24.556 --> 05:28.192
but Elena,
she wouldn't just leave me.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.227
I can't really explain the note,

05:30.295 --> 05:33.898
but she wouldn't
just walk out on me.

05:35.133 --> 05:39.336
Just, please say
you'll help me.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.538
Say you'll do something.

05:41.606 --> 05:44.275
You're Allison Dubois.

05:44.342 --> 05:46.076
Have a dream.

05:46.144 --> 05:47.878
How hard is that?

05:47.946 --> 05:50.347
I'll tell you what.
I will pull her police file,

05:50.415 --> 05:51.999
and I'll take a look at it,
and who knows?

05:52.083 --> 05:53.817
Maybe I'll see something.

05:53.885 --> 05:57.121
That-that's really
the best that I can do.

05:57.188 --> 06:00.507
That would be great.
That's my phone number.

06:00.592 --> 06:03.260
Jeremy Haas.

06:03.328 --> 06:04.929

06:13.355 --> 06:14.939
So, you ready for the
big interview tomorrow?

06:14.990 --> 06:16.774
When you flying out?

06:16.825 --> 06:19.476
Tonight. I promise not
to embarrass you.

06:19.527 --> 06:21.145
You'll do fine.

06:21.212 --> 06:23.013
John is one of the few
genuinely nice guys

06:23.081 --> 06:24.281
practicing corporate law.

06:24.349 --> 06:25.749
Plus, he's already inclined
to like you.

06:25.817 --> 06:26.917
I made sure of that.

06:26.985 --> 06:28.519
Hmm.

06:28.586 --> 06:30.454
Listen, as long as you're
not flying out until tonight,

06:30.522 --> 06:31.655
maybe you could
join me for a drive.

06:31.723 --> 06:32.890
Sure. Where are we going?

06:32.958 --> 06:34.391
The Holman Supermax Prison.

06:34.459 --> 06:37.127
Need to talk to an inmate there.

06:37.195 --> 06:40.931
Robert Edward Lowell raped
and murdered seven women

06:40.999 --> 06:42.266
that we know of.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.535
Serving seven consecutive
life sentences.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.103
Okay.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.689
Yesterday,
a construction crew broke ground

06:48.773 --> 06:50.841
on a new housing development
out near Chandler.

06:50.909 --> 06:53.177
They unearthed
the bones of a dead woman.

06:53.244 --> 06:54.812
Who's this?

06:54.863 --> 06:57.281
We don't know yet.

06:57.348 --> 06:59.116
But Lowell buried
most of his victims

06:59.184 --> 07:01.251
within a mile or two of
where we found that body.

07:01.319 --> 07:03.353
If, indeed, she is
one of his victims,

07:03.405 --> 07:05.656
we're hoping that Lowell
can tell us who she is.

07:05.724 --> 07:09.159
You found a dead girl
in a field,

07:09.227 --> 07:11.228
and you want to know
if she's one of mine?

07:16.167 --> 07:18.902
Hard to say,
unless I get a look at her.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.772
A lot of fields out there.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.675
Maybe a lot of dead girls, too.

07:31.416 --> 07:33.484
Who is she?

07:33.551 --> 07:35.986
And why would I tell you that?

07:36.054 --> 07:40.457
You said a lot of nasty things
about me in that courtroom.

07:40.525 --> 07:42.993
The way I see it,
you and me are enemies.

07:43.061 --> 07:44.795
I'm not your enemy.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.664
If I hadn't put you away,
someone else would have.

07:47.732 --> 07:49.400
Now tell me what you know.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.468
And if what you have
to say checks out,

07:51.536 --> 07:53.754
the warden has agreed to expand
some of your privileges.

07:53.838 --> 07:54.905
Oh, yeah?

07:54.973 --> 07:56.173
How's that?

07:56.241 --> 07:58.042
He'll add another channel
to your television

07:58.109 --> 08:01.145
or give you another 90 minutes
of exercise a week, either one.

08:01.212 --> 08:03.213
Your choice.

08:11.656 --> 08:14.725
Yeah, sure.
I remember that necklace.

08:16.327 --> 08:20.697
I think she said
her name was Kristy.

08:20.765 --> 08:22.866
Picked her up
while she was out exercising,

08:22.934 --> 08:24.234
just like the others.

08:24.302 --> 08:28.072
She had blonde hair.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.443
Everywhere.

08:43.288 --> 08:45.089
Blue eyes.

08:45.156 --> 08:48.959
Deep blue.

08:49.027 --> 08:53.730
Kind of eyes you could drown
in if you weren't careful.

08:57.102 --> 08:59.536
I remember those
eyes real well.

08:59.604 --> 09:03.107
I was staring right into them

09:03.174 --> 09:05.075
when I choked
the life out of her.

09:10.215 --> 09:12.149
That's it.

09:12.217 --> 09:15.319
Took her out to that field
and buried her.

09:15.386 --> 09:18.055
You said her name was Kristy.
What was her last name?

09:18.123 --> 09:21.125
I said "I think her name
was Kristy," boss.

09:21.192 --> 09:23.560
And I have no idea
what her last name was.

09:23.628 --> 09:27.297
I didn't drag her
into my van so we could talk.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.301
Well, he's lying.

09:31.369 --> 09:32.719
He's lying
about all of it.

09:32.804 --> 09:34.388
What did you see? Did
you see the killing?

09:34.472 --> 09:35.906
Did you see who did
it? Was it Lowell?

09:35.974 --> 09:39.176
I just saw the girl,
a completely different girl.

09:40.678 --> 09:42.345
Well, that doesn't surprise
me; he's a sociopath.

09:42.397 --> 09:44.815
He loves the idea of sending
us on a wild goose chase,

09:44.866 --> 09:46.717
but we'll make a sketch
of the girl you saw,

09:46.784 --> 09:48.068
see what turns up.

09:48.153 --> 09:49.953
At least we're not coming away
completely empty-handed.

09:50.021 --> 09:52.156
Yeah.

09:52.207 --> 09:54.357
I'll meet you
at the car. It's Joe.

09:54.409 --> 09:55.559
Hey, honey.

09:55.627 --> 09:57.127
Hey. Where have you been?

09:57.195 --> 09:58.562
I've been trying
to reach you for an hour.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.530
I'm sorry.
I was inside a prison.

10:00.582 --> 10:01.765
They made me
turn my cell phone off.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.033
Is everything okay?

10:03.101 --> 10:05.369
Yeah. Uh, no.

10:05.436 --> 10:07.004
I got a call
from Marie's school.

10:07.071 --> 10:08.839
Apparently, she-she broke down

10:08.907 --> 10:10.407
in the middle
of her spelling test.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.309
What do you mean, "broke down"?

10:12.377 --> 10:13.977
I don't know.
The principal said

10:14.045 --> 10:15.312
she started crying.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.813
No one could console her.

10:16.881 --> 10:18.749
So he wants to sit down with us,

10:18.816 --> 10:20.417
and her teacher's going
to be there, too.

10:20.485 --> 10:22.619
This sounds ominous.
What do you think they want?

10:22.687 --> 10:23.787
I don't know.

10:23.855 --> 10:25.289
They want to do it
right after school.

10:25.356 --> 10:28.492
Honey, I'm in Florence.
I'm, like, 90 minutes away.

10:28.559 --> 10:30.561
Can they just put it off
a little bit?

10:30.628 --> 10:32.362
I don't know.
It didn't sound like it.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.131
Look, if you can't make it,
you can't make it.

10:34.199 --> 10:35.732
But one of us has to be there.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.001
Yeah. Okay, I'm leaving now.

10:39.337 --> 10:40.971
She just kept saying

10:41.039 --> 10:43.006
that the words didn't
make sense to her.

10:43.074 --> 10:45.409
What-What does that mean,

10:45.476 --> 10:47.211
that she-she didn't know
how to spell them?

10:47.278 --> 10:48.912
The truth is, Mr. Dubois,

10:48.980 --> 10:51.215
I think Marie's been
exhibiting some kind

10:51.282 --> 10:53.383
of learning disability
for a while now.

10:53.451 --> 10:56.019
No.

10:56.087 --> 10:58.088
Marie doesn't have
a learning disability.

10:58.156 --> 11:00.324
Her grades are fine.
They've always been fine.

11:00.391 --> 11:02.125
Actually, they've
fallen off lately.

11:02.193 --> 11:03.493
Look, I can assure you,

11:03.561 --> 11:05.662
we don't take this kind of thing
lightly, Mr. Dubois.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.098
I checked in with your
daughter's other teachers.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.566
They've noticed it, too.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.902
It's not uncommon
for children

11:11.970 --> 11:14.204
who suffer from a certain
cluster of symptoms

11:14.272 --> 11:16.139
to learn to disguise
their difficulties.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.176
It's deeply upsetting to them,
as I'm sure you understand.

11:19.244 --> 11:22.212
I really recommend that you
take Marie to see a specialist.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.048
I can refer you
to a woman who's quite good.

11:25.116 --> 11:26.750
A learning disability?

11:26.818 --> 11:28.552
That's what they said.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.687
That's what they
think. No one's sure.

11:30.755 --> 11:32.556
But that's crazy.
She does well in school.

11:32.624 --> 11:33.690
She loves her classes.

11:33.758 --> 11:35.092
That's what I told them.

11:35.159 --> 11:36.827
Do you think they're right?

11:36.894 --> 11:38.362
I don't know.
I hope not.

11:38.429 --> 11:40.597
I mean, I guess that's
what the specialist is for.

11:40.665 --> 11:42.966
Maybe I shouldn't
go on this trip.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.134
You're meeting
with this woman tomorrow.

11:44.202 --> 11:45.168
I should be there.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.970
I-I get why you
feel that way,

11:47.021 --> 11:49.306
but truthfully, Marie is
taking the test, not you.

11:49.374 --> 11:52.876
And whatever this woman says,
I-I'll call you right after.

11:55.163 --> 11:56.346
Hello?

11:56.414 --> 11:57.581
Allison? It's Jeremy Haas.

11:57.649 --> 11:59.016
Remember, from this morning?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.817
How did you get this number?

12:00.885 --> 12:02.452
Someone from your office.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.087
I don't believe that.

12:04.155 --> 12:06.323
I don't believe anyone
at the office would do that.

12:06.374 --> 12:08.392
Okay. Well, I lied a little bit.

12:08.459 --> 12:09.860
I told them we were related.

12:09.927 --> 12:11.128
That there was a family tragedy.

12:11.195 --> 12:12.296
Are you serious?

12:12.363 --> 12:13.630
Don't be mad. I just...

12:13.698 --> 12:16.566
I needed to know if you looked
at the file on Elena.

12:16.634 --> 12:18.635
No. I haven't had a chance yet.

12:18.703 --> 12:20.137
You know what?
I'm going somewhere right now.

12:20.204 --> 12:21.405
I was going to bring it
with me on the plane.

12:21.472 --> 12:22.572
On the plane?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.308
That's the best
that I can do.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.243
You know what? I got to go now.
I have a plane to catch.

12:26.311 --> 12:27.744
No, wait.

12:27.812 --> 12:29.379
No, you wait.
And you know what?

12:29.447 --> 12:31.014
Don't use this number again.

12:31.082 --> 12:33.283
If I have anything to tell you,
I'll call you.

12:39.924 --> 12:41.858
Hi, Mrs. Dubois.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.828
Jeremy?

12:44.896 --> 12:47.998
What's going on?
D-Did you follow me here?

12:49.550 --> 12:50.667
Oh, my God!

12:50.735 --> 12:52.703
Get in the car.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.660
<i>That's her.</i>

12:58.728 --> 13:01.463
That's Elena.

13:02.009 --> 13:03.960
This was her place.

13:04.027 --> 13:06.629
Her folks left it to her.

13:06.697 --> 13:08.965
It was her favorite spot
in all the world.

13:09.032 --> 13:10.700
If you're going to have a dream
about her,

13:10.768 --> 13:12.602
this is the place to do it.

13:12.669 --> 13:15.571
Jeremy, you don't understand.

13:15.639 --> 13:18.241
It's not gonna work.

13:18.308 --> 13:21.377
I can't just will myself
to dream about someone.

13:21.445 --> 13:23.546
I don't know.

13:23.614 --> 13:25.848
I've read about you.

13:25.899 --> 13:27.717
I know that
the people you work for,

13:27.785 --> 13:30.052
they sometimes
give you things,

13:30.120 --> 13:31.220
things that belonged

13:31.288 --> 13:33.890
to a victim or a criminal.

13:33.957 --> 13:37.093
And sometimes they help you
with the-the dreaming thing.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.996
Look in there.

13:40.063 --> 13:43.866
That's her stuff.

13:48.338 --> 13:51.140
This is her favorite nightgown.

13:54.211 --> 13:55.845
This is a bracelet
I gave her

13:55.913 --> 13:58.281
on our fifth
wedding anniversary.

13:58.348 --> 14:00.950
This is her photo album.

14:01.018 --> 14:03.953
I'm not a trained monkey.

14:04.021 --> 14:06.389
The dreams aren't a trick
I can just make happen!

14:10.294 --> 14:12.728
I'm sorry.

14:12.796 --> 14:16.899
I don't want to...
to upset you. I...

14:16.967 --> 14:19.268
I want to make you comfortable.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.137
Are you thirsty?

14:21.205 --> 14:23.239
I'm thirsty.

14:23.307 --> 14:24.974
Honest, Ms. Dubois,

14:25.042 --> 14:27.409
I just want this
to be over with.

14:27.461 --> 14:29.545
I mean, nothing
would make me happier

14:29.613 --> 14:32.882
than for you
to tell me what I need to know,

14:32.933 --> 14:35.685
so I could drive you back
to the airport,

14:35.752 --> 14:37.803
and you can get on a plane,

14:37.888 --> 14:40.256
and you could head to wherever
it is you're going.

14:52.435 --> 14:54.537
It's someone calling
from your house.

14:58.408 --> 15:00.243
Tell them
everything's fine.

15:01.912 --> 15:02.912
Hello?

15:02.980 --> 15:04.080
Hi.

15:04.147 --> 15:07.083
I thought you were gonna call me
when you landed.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.818
I'm sorry, babe.

15:08.886 --> 15:11.988
I-I just got caught up at
the, uh, car rental place.

15:12.055 --> 15:13.556
But I'm driving
to the hotel now.

15:13.624 --> 15:15.658
Um, flight okay?

15:15.726 --> 15:17.360
It was fine.

15:17.427 --> 15:20.763
Well, everything's quiet here.

15:20.831 --> 15:22.932
Marie seems to be doing okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.002
That's great, Joe.
Honey...

15:26.069 --> 15:29.639
I'm driving through
a really strange city right now.

15:29.706 --> 15:31.107
I can't really talk.

15:31.174 --> 15:32.508
Okay.

15:32.576 --> 15:34.110
You want to call me
when you get to the hotel?

15:34.177 --> 15:37.380
I'll try.

15:37.447 --> 15:38.748
You'll try?

15:38.815 --> 15:40.683
Yeah. I love you too, babe.

15:45.756 --> 15:47.757
Nice work.

15:52.329 --> 15:53.496
Have some water.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.037
Jeremy,

16:01.104 --> 16:03.239
eventually people
are going to realize

16:03.307 --> 16:05.741
I'm not where
I'm supposed to be.

16:05.809 --> 16:08.711
They're going to come looking
for me.

16:08.779 --> 16:11.647
It's, it's not going
to be good for you.

16:11.715 --> 16:14.016
I don't think so.

16:14.084 --> 16:16.052
No. In fact, I think
we're going to be out of here

16:16.119 --> 16:17.186
before you know it.

16:17.254 --> 16:18.955
I mean, really,
all that needs to happen

16:19.022 --> 16:20.423
is for you to fall asleep.

16:20.490 --> 16:21.724
Sleep?

16:21.792 --> 16:23.459
That's not in the cards.

16:23.527 --> 16:25.628
You're pointing a gun at me.

16:25.696 --> 16:26.796
I'm terrified.

16:26.863 --> 16:28.831
Well, don't be.

16:28.899 --> 16:31.767
Like I told you,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

16:31.835 --> 16:34.971
Besides, any minute now,
you'll be asleep

16:35.038 --> 16:36.405
whether you want
to be or not.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.607
What are you talking about?

16:38.675 --> 16:40.576
I crushed up some
of Elena's sleeping pills

16:40.644 --> 16:41.744
and put them in the water.

16:41.812 --> 16:44.413
I only pretended
it was a new bottle.

16:50.053 --> 16:51.654
You... you drugged me.

16:51.722 --> 16:54.940
I'm only trying
to move things along.

16:56.526 --> 16:57.960
It'll be
all right, Allison.

16:58.028 --> 17:02.999
Just do a little dreaming
for me, and it'll be all right.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.293
You sleep all right?

17:49.246 --> 17:50.913
Any dreams to share?

17:50.964 --> 17:52.548
Good morning to you, too.

17:52.616 --> 17:54.517
One.

17:54.584 --> 17:55.918
But it wasn't about your wife.

17:55.986 --> 17:57.920
It was about another crime.

17:57.971 --> 18:00.289
A murder.

18:00.357 --> 18:02.892
Hey, let me out of this!

18:02.959 --> 18:04.727
I got to call someone!

18:04.795 --> 18:06.962
I need to tell them
what happened.

18:07.030 --> 18:09.598
When we're done here, you
can call anyone you like.

18:09.666 --> 18:11.567
You know this girl
I dreamt about?

18:11.635 --> 18:12.835
She's young.

18:12.903 --> 18:15.171
She has a family.

18:15.238 --> 18:18.174
I'm sure her family
is as anxious as you are

18:18.241 --> 18:21.110
to figure out what happened
to their loved one.

18:21.178 --> 18:24.814
Well, they're just going to have
to wait their turn.

18:24.881 --> 18:27.550
You're busy.

18:27.617 --> 18:29.251
I'll get you some breakfast.

18:33.423 --> 18:34.957
ALLISON
<i>Hey. This is Allison.</i>

18:35.025 --> 18:36.325
Leave a message at the tone.

18:37.794 --> 18:38.961
Hey, it's me.

18:39.012 --> 18:40.796
I thought you'd call me
before your interview.

18:40.864 --> 18:42.765
Yeah, go ahead.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.767
Um, well, we're
at the psychologist's right now.

18:44.835 --> 18:47.503
So I guess I'll try you back
after I've talked to her.

18:47.554 --> 18:49.438
Good luck.
I'm thinking about you.

19:00.217 --> 19:01.484
Come on.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.587
I'm sorry.
You say something?

19:04.654 --> 19:06.155
No. Sorry.

19:06.223 --> 19:08.157
I was just talking to myself.
I didn't mean to bother you.

19:08.225 --> 19:09.492
Oh. Not a problem.

19:14.498 --> 19:16.932
You know, whenever I
start talking to myself,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.400
I take it as a
signal to walk away

19:18.468 --> 19:19.869
from whatever I'm working
on for ten minutes.

19:21.004 --> 19:22.037
Mr. Dubois?

19:22.105 --> 19:23.439
Marie and I are done
with our session.

19:23.507 --> 19:24.607
Would you like to come in,
please?

19:24.674 --> 19:26.542
Sure.

19:28.711 --> 19:29.912
Okay.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.647
Hey, you.

19:31.698 --> 19:33.782
Hey.

19:33.850 --> 19:35.784
Mr. Dubois,
I have to tell you,

19:35.852 --> 19:36.952
you've raised
a remarkable young lady.

19:38.188 --> 19:40.189
Thank you.

19:40.257 --> 19:42.491
So... So you
ran some tests?

19:42.542 --> 19:44.126
Quite a few.

19:44.194 --> 19:46.028
And I have
to be honest with you.

19:46.096 --> 19:48.998
I'm not quite sure
why Marie was referred to me.

19:49.065 --> 19:52.601
In my opinion, there's nothing
at all wrong with your daughter.

19:52.669 --> 19:53.669
Oh, really?

19:53.737 --> 19:54.937
I'm quite certain.

19:55.005 --> 19:57.540
I detect no problem
with her reading comprehension

19:57.607 --> 19:59.708
or her vocabulary skills.

19:59.776 --> 20:01.944
In fact, she's rather
advanced for her age.

20:02.012 --> 20:05.681
Well, I can't tell you
how glad I am to hear that.

20:05.749 --> 20:07.082
Frankly, my wife and I
found this whole thing

20:07.150 --> 20:08.350
with school puzzling.

20:08.418 --> 20:11.654
Well, as far as the incident
with the spelling test goes,

20:11.721 --> 20:13.989
my best guess is,
perhaps she suffered

20:14.057 --> 20:16.358
from some good
old-fashioned anxiety.

20:16.426 --> 20:20.362
I mean, she had no trouble
with her spelling here today.

20:20.430 --> 20:22.198
The only other thing
I can think of:

20:22.265 --> 20:24.667
Marie did mention
her mother was on a trip.

20:24.734 --> 20:27.002
No. Yeah. My wife's in
Colorado for the day.

20:27.070 --> 20:29.772
Maybe that's what
triggered her crying jag.

20:29.839 --> 20:31.774
You'd be surprised
how stressful it can be

20:31.841 --> 20:33.542
for a child when
a parent takes a trip,

20:33.610 --> 20:35.578
even a short one.

20:35.645 --> 20:38.647
In any case, I have the feeling
that what happened yesterday

20:38.715 --> 20:40.683
will turn out
to be a one-time thing.

20:44.621 --> 20:46.388
Sorry. That's my
wife's office.

20:46.456 --> 20:47.556
Would you excuse me
for just one minute?

20:47.607 --> 20:48.724
Of course.

20:48.792 --> 20:51.160
Hello?

20:51.228 --> 20:52.695
Joe, it's Manuel Devalos.

20:52.762 --> 20:54.730
Listen,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

20:54.798 --> 20:56.699
but I just got off the phone
with John Schultz,

20:56.766 --> 20:59.568
the man Allison was supposed
to interview with this morning.

20:59.636 --> 21:01.036
What do you mean "supposed to"?

21:01.104 --> 21:02.471
It didn't happen?

21:02.539 --> 21:04.473
Well, according to John,
Allison never showed up.

21:07.143 --> 21:09.345
He's got to stop
calling eventually.

21:09.412 --> 21:11.347
He knows something is wrong.

21:11.414 --> 21:12.748
So does my boss.

21:12.816 --> 21:14.817
Jeremy, think about
what you're doing here.

21:14.884 --> 21:17.486
This is kidnapping.

21:17.554 --> 21:19.388
If the D.A. decides
to press charges,

21:19.456 --> 21:21.924
you could go to prison for
the rest of your life.

21:21.992 --> 21:23.892
Well, that's up to you,
isn't it?

21:23.960 --> 21:26.762
I mean,
you'd have to say something.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.298
I mean, you'd have
to tell someone

21:29.366 --> 21:30.599
that that's what happened here.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.202
But I have a feeling
that when you do get around

21:33.270 --> 21:34.370
to dreaming the dream

21:34.437 --> 21:36.205
that tells us
where my wife is,

21:36.273 --> 21:37.606
you'll realize

21:37.674 --> 21:40.409
that there was a greater purpose
for my bringing you here.

21:40.477 --> 21:42.177
That you won't report me.

21:42.245 --> 21:44.179
That you'll be happy
for me and her.

21:44.247 --> 21:47.916
And you'll look back on this
experience with pride.

21:47.984 --> 21:49.918
Well, maybe.

21:49.986 --> 21:52.221
But maybe not.

21:52.289 --> 21:54.523
What if I have a dream,

21:54.591 --> 21:58.494
and it tells us
what we already know?

21:58.561 --> 22:00.596
That your wife just left you.

22:00.664 --> 22:02.064
She just left.

22:02.132 --> 22:03.766
No.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.835
I don't think
that's what happened.

22:06.903 --> 22:10.072
I don't think that's what
you're going to dream.

22:10.140 --> 22:12.308
We had fights, sure.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.243
Now, I'm certain
I was a disappointment to her.

22:14.311 --> 22:15.744
Hell, I was a disappointment
to myself.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.246
I couldn't bring in money--

22:17.314 --> 22:18.614
not the kind we needed--

22:18.682 --> 22:21.317
but I loved her,
and she loved me.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.519
And we were having a baby
together.

22:34.898 --> 22:36.899
What do you say?

22:38.084 --> 22:40.602
We do a little bit
more dreaming?

22:42.639 --> 22:44.640
Oh...

22:46.409 --> 22:48.210
Did I want to be a single mom?

22:48.278 --> 22:49.812
No, of course not.

22:49.879 --> 22:52.648
I don't think anybody
ever says to themselves,

22:52.716 --> 22:56.352
"Hey, I want to be pregnant
and alone."

22:56.419 --> 22:57.720
You know what?

22:57.787 --> 23:00.089
It's doable.

23:00.156 --> 23:03.125
It-it's more than doable.

23:03.193 --> 23:05.027
Oh.

23:05.095 --> 23:07.029
Wow.

23:07.097 --> 23:09.631
And pretty soon,
you won't be all alone.

23:09.699 --> 23:12.835
You'll have the most interesting
person you'll ever meet

23:12.902 --> 23:14.937
in your entire life
to keep you company.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.074
No.

23:19.142 --> 23:20.376
Don't cry.

23:20.443 --> 23:23.011
Look, your husband may have
put that baby in you,

23:23.079 --> 23:25.647
but that doesn't make you
or it his property.

23:27.050 --> 23:30.018
You said you were thinking
about leaving him, so leave.

23:30.086 --> 23:33.555
He doesn't make you happy,

23:33.623 --> 23:35.624
so make yourself happy.

23:36.626 --> 23:38.527
It can be done.

23:38.595 --> 23:42.164
I'm living proof.

23:43.666 --> 23:46.535
It's gonna
be okay... Elena.

23:47.937 --> 23:50.239
You're going
to be okay.

23:51.474 --> 23:52.641
It's okay, Elena.

23:58.515 --> 24:00.449
You saw something,
didn't you?

24:00.517 --> 24:02.251
You said her name.

24:02.318 --> 24:04.920
I heard you.

24:04.988 --> 24:06.955
So what did you see?

24:07.023 --> 24:09.892
Nothing good.

24:11.010 --> 24:13.871
I knew it.
Elena didn't leave me.

24:15.509 --> 24:18.326
Jeremy, nothing that I just saw,
nothing I just told you proves

24:18.426 --> 24:21.428
that your wife didn't just leave
of her own accord.

24:21.496 --> 24:25.599
I mean, it-it really seems like
what she was discussing with...

24:25.666 --> 24:27.467
With a murderer.
That's what you told me.

24:27.535 --> 24:29.936
You don't have to be a genius
to figure out the rest.

24:30.004 --> 24:31.671
That woman did something
to my wife.

24:31.739 --> 24:33.573
You don't know that.
We don't know that.

24:33.641 --> 24:35.175
In fact, in my dream,

24:35.243 --> 24:37.611
that woman looked every bit
as pregnant as Elena was.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.980
She looked like
she was about to give birth.

24:40.047 --> 24:43.250
She didn't look like she was in
any condition to murder someone.

24:43.317 --> 24:46.887
Look, what I need to do is go
call the people that I work with

24:46.954 --> 24:48.889
so I can tell them what I know.

24:48.956 --> 24:51.324
So I can give them a chance
to start investigating.

24:51.392 --> 24:53.093
No. You're not calling anyone.

24:53.161 --> 24:54.494
Not yet.

24:54.562 --> 24:56.296
We're too close to the truth.

24:56.364 --> 24:59.432
What you need to do
is to sleep some more.

25:00.802 --> 25:02.969
You need to-to dream some more.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.807
What's that?

25:09.877 --> 25:12.212
Don't say a word.

25:12.263 --> 25:14.547
I'm going to see
what's going on.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.528
It's just the mailman.

25:28.579 --> 25:30.130
He'll be gone in a second.

25:30.198 --> 25:31.731
We just won't make any noise.

25:31.782 --> 25:33.200
Hello?

25:33.267 --> 25:34.901
Help! I'm in here!

25:34.952 --> 25:36.603
Stop it!
Help!

25:37.839 --> 25:38.922
Help!

25:39.006 --> 25:40.207
I've been kidnapped!

25:40.258 --> 25:42.926
Are you crazy?
Do you want me to kill you?

25:43.010 --> 25:44.344
I dare you!

25:44.412 --> 25:46.079
Then you'll never know
what happened to your wife.

25:46.147 --> 25:48.081
What's going on in there?

25:48.149 --> 25:49.349
Don't leave me, please!

25:49.417 --> 25:50.750
Hello?
Open up!

25:50.801 --> 25:52.419
I'm chained
to this bed!

25:52.486 --> 25:53.987
No!

25:55.356 --> 25:57.090
Please!

26:02.129 --> 26:04.648
I'm in here!

26:05.700 --> 26:07.534
I'm back here!
I'm back here!

26:07.602 --> 26:10.737
Please!

26:10.788 --> 26:12.539
Please. Thank you.

26:12.607 --> 26:14.474
Thank you.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.826
WOMAN
Paging Dr. Statement.
Dr. Statement, please.

26:16.911 --> 26:19.045
All right, thanks.

26:19.113 --> 26:21.381
No new news.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.984
They're running
more tests.

26:28.155 --> 26:29.589
Once they're sure

26:29.657 --> 26:31.691
that man didn't give Mommy
anything dangerous,

26:31.759 --> 26:33.727
we'll be taking her home.

26:36.981 --> 26:40.667
Dad, she's doing it again.

26:40.735 --> 26:42.736
She's doing what again?

26:43.821 --> 26:45.639
What's going on, Marie?

26:45.706 --> 26:47.440
I can't read
this book, Daddy.

26:47.508 --> 26:49.809
I can't read any
of these books.

26:53.147 --> 26:56.283
How could you have
been in so much trouble

26:56.350 --> 26:58.318
and me not have known?

26:59.887 --> 27:01.855
I just always thought...

27:01.923 --> 27:03.790
we had this connection.

27:03.858 --> 27:06.192
That I'd-I'd feel
it, I'd sense it.

27:08.796 --> 27:11.264
I mean, it drives me
crazy to think that

27:11.332 --> 27:14.034
you were in that cabin, and
this guy was drugging you,

27:14.101 --> 27:18.638
and I had you in a
hotel room in Denver.

27:18.706 --> 27:21.942
So happy...
to be in this car,

27:22.009 --> 27:25.445
to be leaning on you,
to be having this conversation.

27:34.989 --> 27:37.524
Hello.

27:37.591 --> 27:38.992
It's for you.

27:39.060 --> 27:41.361
Hello?

27:41.429 --> 27:43.430
Hey, Lee.

27:49.637 --> 27:50.904
Okay, yeah, yeah.

27:50.972 --> 27:53.006
Yeah, I'll be there. Thanks.

27:53.074 --> 27:55.875
The police picked up Jeremy
an hour ago in Kingman.

27:55.943 --> 27:58.712
A patrolman spotted him
trying to abandon his car

27:58.779 --> 28:00.013
in a parking lot.

28:00.081 --> 28:01.815
They took him in
without incident.

28:01.882 --> 28:04.217
Well, that's got to
make you sleep easier.

28:04.285 --> 28:06.720
Yeah. No. Definitely.

28:06.787 --> 28:09.255
Anyway, they're bringing him
back to Phoenix tonight.

28:09.323 --> 28:12.392
They want me to come in
in the morning and identify him.

28:12.460 --> 28:13.693
You okay with that?

28:13.761 --> 28:15.128
You ready for that?

28:15.196 --> 28:17.697
I just want
this thing behind me.

28:19.834 --> 28:23.503
I just want to open my eyes
and have it all be over.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.572
Well, I take
that as a yes.

28:25.639 --> 28:28.208
Yes, it's definitely a yes.

28:37.485 --> 28:39.119
I did it.

28:39.186 --> 28:41.488
I left Jeremy.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.826
Oh, my God.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.228
You-you did it.

28:48.295 --> 28:50.263
You-you actually did it.

28:50.331 --> 28:53.500
Well... come in.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.035
Uh, let's talk, hmm?

28:59.840 --> 29:01.841
I don't know.

29:02.843 --> 29:04.844
I don't know
about any of this.

29:04.912 --> 29:07.280
What do you mean,
you don't know?

29:07.348 --> 29:09.215
You did it.

29:09.283 --> 29:11.684
That's the hardest part.

29:11.752 --> 29:14.320
Then why doesn't it feel good?

29:14.388 --> 29:16.623
You know, why doesn't
it feel right?

29:16.690 --> 29:20.660
Hey, it... it's not easy
to rip off a Band-Aid.

29:20.728 --> 29:22.295
It hurts.

29:22.363 --> 29:23.663
It's more than that.

29:23.731 --> 29:26.599
I... I think about
Jeremy without me.

29:26.667 --> 29:29.135
He'll be helpless.

29:29.203 --> 29:31.404
He's helpless with you, Elena.

29:31.472 --> 29:33.406
I know, but

29:33.474 --> 29:35.475
this will be worse.

29:36.744 --> 29:38.711
The truth is-is that

29:38.779 --> 29:40.880
I think about me
without him.

29:42.316 --> 29:44.484
I think about our
baby without a dad.

29:44.535 --> 29:46.219
Oh.

29:46.287 --> 29:48.488
I just think I'm
making a mistake.

29:50.324 --> 29:52.425
I've got to go.
I've got to go home.

29:52.493 --> 29:54.160
Uh, uh, uh, wait a second.

29:54.228 --> 29:55.962
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

29:56.013 --> 29:57.764
You...

29:57.832 --> 30:01.201
You put a lot of thought
into whether or not to leave.

30:02.470 --> 30:04.771
Don't you want to
put a little thought

30:04.839 --> 30:06.639
into whether or
not to go back?

30:06.707 --> 30:09.075
Does...

30:09.143 --> 30:11.144
Does he know where you are?

30:11.212 --> 30:14.147
I mean, did... did you
tell him you were here?

30:14.215 --> 30:15.682
Uh-uh.

30:17.852 --> 30:19.953
Okay.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.955
Then we can take a minute

30:22.022 --> 30:23.990
and talk some more.

30:26.293 --> 30:27.627
Come here.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.329
Come here.

30:29.396 --> 30:30.663
Come here.

30:52.522 --> 30:54.624
I know I put you through a lot.

30:55.859 --> 30:58.127
I know what I did was wrong.

30:58.195 --> 31:01.264
I just hope you understand...

31:01.331 --> 31:03.399
I had to do it.

31:03.467 --> 31:05.468
No one wanted to help me.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.209
You did...

31:13.277 --> 31:15.811
put me through a lot.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.049
And it was more than wrong.

31:20.117 --> 31:23.219
It was criminal,
and it was dangerous.

31:25.756 --> 31:28.057
But I'm not here
to talk about that.

31:29.259 --> 31:31.260
I'm here to talk
about Elena.

31:33.597 --> 31:35.598
I had another dream.

31:37.734 --> 31:40.336
You were half right.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.639
She did leave you, but...

31:45.142 --> 31:47.543
...she changed her mind.

31:47.611 --> 31:49.578
She wanted to come back.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.647
Well, where is she now?

31:51.715 --> 31:53.649
That woman
that I've been dreaming about--

31:53.717 --> 31:57.420
she... she injected her
with something.

31:58.722 --> 32:02.358
That was the night
that she left you.

32:02.426 --> 32:05.795
Is she... is she dead?

32:09.299 --> 32:11.233
I can't say for certain.

32:11.301 --> 32:13.002
Not yet, but...

32:13.070 --> 32:16.672
I have to believe.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.443
No.

32:20.510 --> 32:24.547
I gave the police a
description of her attacker.

32:24.614 --> 32:27.249
They're doing everything
they can to find her

32:27.351 --> 32:29.585
and find out what
happened to your wife.

32:34.091 --> 32:36.025
Thank you.

32:36.093 --> 32:40.196
Again, I know
what I did was wrong.

32:41.465 --> 32:44.533
I know I caused you
and your family a lot of pain,

32:44.601 --> 32:46.802
and I'm prepared
to pay for that.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.441
I don't know
if you can understand this...

32:53.944 --> 32:56.579
...but just... hearing

32:56.646 --> 32:59.015
that people ar-are looking,

32:59.082 --> 33:02.151
that people are trying
to figure out what happened...

33:04.121 --> 33:07.123
...it makes any punishment,

33:07.190 --> 33:09.825
wherever I have to go, bearable.

33:09.893 --> 33:11.794
You don't have to worry.
You're not going anywhere.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.529
The police are processing
your release.

33:13.597 --> 33:15.564
What?

33:15.632 --> 33:17.166
I don't understand.

33:17.234 --> 33:19.268
What you did to me was terrible,

33:19.336 --> 33:22.772
and if I could send you away
for a few years

33:22.839 --> 33:25.274
to pay for it, I would.

33:25.342 --> 33:26.976
But you know what?

33:27.044 --> 33:29.311
You're looking
at kidnapping charges.

33:29.379 --> 33:33.182
That's... That carries
life in prison or worse.

33:35.419 --> 33:37.353
And I...

33:37.421 --> 33:40.056
I just... I don't believe
that you deserve that.

33:42.292 --> 33:44.994
So I had a conversation
with the district attorney.

33:47.130 --> 33:49.465
I told him

33:49.533 --> 33:52.601
that I refused

33:52.669 --> 33:54.837
to identify you

33:54.905 --> 33:57.807
as my abductor.

34:00.844 --> 34:04.547
It took a long time
to explain to him why.

34:04.614 --> 34:06.549
I... I don't even...

34:06.616 --> 34:09.284
think he understands it,

34:09.351 --> 34:11.754
but it doesn't matter.

34:11.822 --> 34:14.757
Without me testifying,
they have no case against you,

34:14.824 --> 34:16.958
so they're dropping the charges.

34:19.262 --> 34:21.297
I'm sorry

34:21.364 --> 34:24.600
about everything
that happened to you,

34:24.668 --> 34:27.335
but I really think
you need to start accepting

34:27.404 --> 34:29.772
that your wife and your child

34:29.840 --> 34:32.274
are almost certainly
never coming back.

34:34.060 --> 34:36.978
And I really need you
to stay the hell away from me!

34:44.987 --> 34:48.757
JOE
If X dominates Y,
then it has to be

34:48.824 --> 34:51.293
better than Y for at least one
objective function.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.362
Well, you didn't tell me
you were working on math.

34:54.431 --> 34:55.898
Uh, yeah. Uh, it's...

34:55.966 --> 34:57.566
Yeah, it's essentially
a math problem.

34:57.634 --> 34:59.835
I'm trying to define a complex
genetic, um, algorithm.

34:59.903 --> 35:03.606
I don't mean to be forward, but
I happen to know a thing or two

35:03.673 --> 35:04.773
about complex algorithms.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.275
Mind if I take a look?

35:06.343 --> 35:07.776
You're kidding?

35:07.844 --> 35:10.980
Oh, be my guest.

35:13.133 --> 35:15.050
Okay.

35:17.487 --> 35:19.989
Your Z value is a
constant, correct?

35:20.056 --> 35:22.091
Yeah.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.195
Well, then wouldn't that
necessitate a plus sign...

35:26.263 --> 35:28.264
right here?

35:40.310 --> 35:41.544
Hmm.

35:41.611 --> 35:43.946
It works!

35:44.014 --> 35:45.981
I can't believe it works.

35:46.049 --> 35:48.651
Well, who are you?

35:48.718 --> 35:49.818
Oh, Harold Clark.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.120
I'm an associate
physics professor

35:51.188 --> 35:53.122
at Mesa University,
though I'm up for tenure,

35:53.190 --> 35:55.324
so I'm hoping to drop
the associate part soon.

35:55.392 --> 35:57.693
Joe Dubois,
extremely grateful engineer.

35:57.761 --> 35:59.461
Oh, glad to be
of some help.

35:59.513 --> 36:00.629
You-you... I...

36:00.680 --> 36:02.331
You don't know
the half of it.

36:02.399 --> 36:03.966
Oh, you ready to go, champ?

36:04.034 --> 36:05.133
Okay.

36:06.303 --> 36:07.403
Good luck to you.

36:07.470 --> 36:08.904
And to you.
Thanks again.

36:14.544 --> 36:18.013
Oh. Hey, you. Whoa.

36:18.081 --> 36:21.149
Marie, why don't you find a
place take to sit over here

36:21.201 --> 36:23.586
while I talk to your
dad for a minute?

36:25.455 --> 36:27.373
Mr. Dubois,

36:27.457 --> 36:29.525
I'm baffled.

36:29.593 --> 36:33.062
Your little girl aced
every test that I threw at her.

36:33.129 --> 36:35.564
Every single one.
I don't know what to tell you.

36:35.632 --> 36:39.868
There is no evidence of any
learning disability whatsoever.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.203
But, uh, eh...

36:41.271 --> 36:42.688
No. I feel terrible that

36:42.772 --> 36:45.107
I don't have any kind
of answer for you.

36:45.175 --> 36:46.909
Um, all these tests,

36:46.977 --> 36:48.911
and there's nothing
to show for it.

36:48.979 --> 36:50.713
Well, actually, uh...

36:50.780 --> 36:53.916
Mr. Dubois,
it is not unheard of

36:53.984 --> 36:57.953
for a child Marie's age
to feign learning disabilities.

36:59.222 --> 37:02.658
And the, uh, trick is
to figure out why.

37:02.726 --> 37:05.561
You know, I don't think
my daughter is faking it.

37:05.629 --> 37:07.296
But I do think

37:07.364 --> 37:09.431
I might know the "why."

37:09.499 --> 37:12.101
<i>"Pester."</i>

37:12.168 --> 37:16.405
"P-E-S-T-E-R."

37:16.473 --> 37:18.540
Outstanding. You're
on fire, Marie.

37:18.608 --> 37:22.911
Now, how about...
oh, "moist"?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.546
"Moist."

37:24.614 --> 37:26.548
"M-O-Y..."

37:26.616 --> 37:29.985
No. "M-O-I-S-T."

37:30.053 --> 37:31.186
"Moist."

37:31.254 --> 37:32.421
Incredible.

37:32.489 --> 37:33.989
You're a freak
of nature, Marie.

37:34.057 --> 37:35.157
Congratulations.

37:35.225 --> 37:37.693
From illiterate to genius
in a matter of days.

37:37.761 --> 37:39.128
Yeah. I'm amazing.

37:39.195 --> 37:41.530
Mm.
I don't know what to think.

37:41.581 --> 37:44.249
Then don't think.

37:44.334 --> 37:46.418
Just accept

37:46.503 --> 37:48.304
that a force
that you don't understand

37:48.371 --> 37:51.774
made our daughter incapable
of learning reading and spelling

37:51.841 --> 37:53.942
long enough
for you to have her tested,

37:54.010 --> 37:56.845
which made it possible
for you to meet that guy who...

37:56.913 --> 37:59.615
That guy who was able to help me
figure out the algorithm

37:59.683 --> 38:01.216
that could land us
that government contract.

38:01.284 --> 38:02.584
Exactly.

38:02.636 --> 38:04.953
You don't think maybe
that was just a coincidence?

38:05.021 --> 38:06.655
Hey, aren't you the guy
who said

38:06.723 --> 38:07.990
you didn't believe
in coincidences?

38:08.058 --> 38:09.758
I don't think
that was actually me.

38:09.793 --> 38:12.528
I think that was maybe someone
who just looked like me.

38:13.763 --> 38:17.032
Your eyes are
still open.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.134
I can hear them.

38:20.403 --> 38:22.404
Mm, just thinking
about Jeremy.

38:24.007 --> 38:26.375
That's not the name
I was hoping to hear.

38:27.944 --> 38:29.778
Are we, perchance,

38:29.846 --> 38:31.880
experiencing a bit of
Stockholm Syndrome?

38:31.948 --> 38:34.149
No, my love.

38:34.217 --> 38:36.151
It's just, wishing
I could understand

38:36.219 --> 38:38.387
what happened to his wife.

38:38.455 --> 38:40.489
What were those injections
all about,

38:40.557 --> 38:44.193
and why hasn't anyone
ever heard from her again?

38:44.260 --> 38:47.396
And what about
that other woman?

38:47.464 --> 38:48.731
The murderess?

38:48.798 --> 38:50.065
What's she all about?

38:50.133 --> 38:53.535
My sense is-- and this
is a technical term--

38:53.603 --> 38:55.137
that she's all
about crazy.

38:55.205 --> 38:57.706
I think you're right.

38:57.774 --> 39:00.676
But that doesn't
really help Jeremy.

39:00.744 --> 39:03.212
Oh, is that what this
conversation is about?

39:03.279 --> 39:05.047
Helping Jeremy?

39:05.115 --> 39:06.782
Oh, Al, because of you,

39:06.850 --> 39:10.185
Jeremy doesn't have to go to
prison for the rest of his life.

39:10.253 --> 39:13.255
I don't think you owe him
anything more than that.

39:13.323 --> 39:15.958
In fact, I don't think
you owe him anything.

39:16.025 --> 39:17.960
Go to sleep.

39:18.027 --> 39:20.028
Shh, shh.

39:22.465 --> 39:25.667
Mmm.

39:49.325 --> 39:51.326
Oh.

39:58.334 --> 39:59.868
Oh.

40:00.904 --> 40:02.571
Shh.

40:04.974 --> 40:07.092
That wasn't much
of a nap, was it?

40:08.511 --> 40:10.512
Mommy's here.

40:12.081 --> 40:14.082
Your real mommy.

40:15.351 --> 40:16.452
I'm glad you're awake.

40:17.754 --> 40:20.722
I wanted to tell you
your new name.

40:20.790 --> 40:23.725
Alexandra.

40:23.793 --> 40:25.661
Alexandra...

40:25.728 --> 40:28.263
Elizabeth Tate.

40:45.281 --> 40:47.382
Allison?

40:47.450 --> 40:50.018
I, uh... I got your message,

40:50.086 --> 40:52.054
but, uh, I don't get it.

40:52.121 --> 40:54.289
What-what are we doing here?

40:59.629 --> 41:01.497
I know who killed your wife.

41:01.564 --> 41:05.701
Then she's... ?

41:05.768 --> 41:08.036
Her name is Veronica Tate.

41:08.104 --> 41:10.772
Police arrested her
this morning.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.275
Oh, my God.

41:13.343 --> 41:15.310
She used to be a maternity nurse

41:15.378 --> 41:17.946
at Phoenix General.

41:18.014 --> 41:20.115
Not only
did she kill your wife.

41:20.183 --> 41:23.685
She murdered another woman
named Maureen Hosler,

41:23.753 --> 41:26.722
the woman whose bones
we found outside of Chandler.

41:26.789 --> 41:29.858
Miss Hosler was also pregnant
at the time she was murdered,

41:29.926 --> 41:31.860
just like your wife.

41:31.928 --> 41:33.929
What kind of woman does that?

41:33.997 --> 41:36.765
The kind of woman
who wants to be a mother.

41:36.833 --> 41:39.334
She couldn't have children
of her own.

41:41.638 --> 41:43.639
She faked
two separate pregnancies.

41:43.706 --> 41:46.642
And then she stalked women
who were really pregnant.

41:49.112 --> 41:51.480
She took her victims' babies,
Jeremy.

41:51.548 --> 41:55.150
She raised them as her own.

41:55.218 --> 41:58.220
The other child

41:58.288 --> 42:00.856
that she took
is back with her father.

42:02.659 --> 42:04.726
But I wanted
to tell you in person.

42:10.033 --> 42:12.401
You see that little
girl right there?

42:20.677 --> 42:22.611
That's her.

42:22.679 --> 42:24.713
Jeremy, that's
your daughter.

42:30.386 --> 42:32.321
I have a daughter?

42:37.193 --> 42:39.928
Want to go in
and meet her?
