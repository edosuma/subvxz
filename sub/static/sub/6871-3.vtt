00:20.220 --> 00:22.154
Lana:
I dunno,
it just feels weird.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.522
Archer:
That's just the altitude,
dummy.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.990
Lana:
I'm talking about the--

00:24.992 --> 00:27.459
Archer:
Try popping your ears,
go like this...

00:27.461 --> 00:30.062
Mawp, mawp, mawp,
mawwwwwwp!

00:30.064 --> 00:32.664
Goddammit,
it's not my ears!
What?

00:32.665 --> 00:35.134
Sorry,
my ears won't pop.
[sighs]

00:35.136 --> 00:36.835
Ray,
did you bring gum?
No.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.470
Well great,
trip's ruined.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.072
Sorry, ray forgot
to bring gum--

00:40.074 --> 00:42.074
I'm talking about
the fact

00:42.076 --> 00:44.476
That we're about to climb
a swiss goddamn frickin alp

00:44.478 --> 00:46.412
To assassinate somebody!

00:46.414 --> 00:48.147
The target's an assassin,
lana,

00:48.149 --> 00:51.016
Not a king, or a pope,
or a-- vice-pope.

00:51.018 --> 00:55.054
So it's not assassination.
It's just a extrajudicial
killing.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.388
And that makes it better.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.090
Yes, lana, that's why
they made up

00:58.092 --> 00:59.591
A whole different word
for it.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.061
And the cia told mother
the target has killed judges

01:02.063 --> 01:05.764
And prosecutors and bankers
and generals all over the world,

01:05.766 --> 01:07.399
So god knows how many
actual assassinations

01:07.401 --> 01:09.501
We'll be preventing.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.204
And of course your mother
would do anything to impress
the cia,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.339
So--
oh, my god!

01:14.341 --> 01:18.210
You have to try this!
Hot cocoa, dark creme de cacao,

01:18.212 --> 01:20.846
Hint of creme de menthe,
and peppermint schnapps.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.347
I call it a peppermint patty.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.283
Here.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.385
Wow,
that is your major loss.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.920
Ooh, can I try it?
No.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.055
How hard is it to remember gum?

01:30.057 --> 01:33.392
[sighs]
okay, so tonight we infiltrate
this swanky climbing party.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.061
Then tomorrow we
extra-judicially kill this guy.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.229
Yeah, or woman.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.697
Wait, what?
Excuse me?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.399
We kill whoever it is.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.868
You don't know
who the target is?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.237
I mean...
Ugh, god dammit.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.073
And since you obviously didn't
read the mission dossier--

01:48.075 --> 01:51.810
For your information, lana...
I skimmed it.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.113
And bully for you.
Give it here.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.747
Ah.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.950
God dammit!
Where the hell is it?

01:57.952 --> 01:59.818
I assume on the back
of my toilet.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.221
What, lana? Look at all
the shit I had to pack.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.890
I don't know what people
are gonna be wearing for
apres-montee!

02:04.892 --> 02:07.059
S--
and ray didn't bring
the gum!

02:07.061 --> 02:09.161
[groans]

02:09.163 --> 02:10.795
Ah.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.031
Witch...

02:16.302 --> 02:20.806
Just like every car trip
I ever took with mom and daddy.

02:20.808 --> 02:25.144
Only I'm not getting whipped
with a fan belt.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.247
Lana, wait!
I just remembered a crucial
detail about the target.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.682
I made a mental note
of it at the time.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.851
Oh! Oh, my...

02:32.853 --> 02:35.187
And you must be
our late reservations.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.122
Good to see some
fellow americans.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.491
I'm your guide,
crash mccarran.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.294
Is-- um... I thought
there were three of you.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.196
One of us is weeping
in the car.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.998
Oh. Uh, okay,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.634
Well, come on in and meet
the rest of the climbing party.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.702
That's hans hessler,
from germany.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.937
<i>Guten abend.</i>

02:51.939 --> 02:52.971
Mario savino,
from Italy...

02:52.973 --> 02:54.439
<i>Buonasera.</i>

02:54.441 --> 02:57.676
And michiko ishikawa,
from japan.
Konbanwa.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.012
We're just heading into
the bar for some gluhwein.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.981
Why don't you join us
when you're ready?

03:02.983 --> 03:05.317
Well? What's this
"crucial detail"

03:05.319 --> 03:06.885
You remembered
about the target?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.855
The target was from a country
that in world war two,

03:09.857 --> 03:12.224
Was an axis power.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.527
[sighs]

03:15.529 --> 03:17.296
Ray forgot the gum.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.004
[lana]
so... How'd you
get the name crash?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.440
Oh, it's a long story...

04:01.442 --> 04:03.709
About me saving the lives
of eight other climbers

04:03.711 --> 04:04.676
Right after an avalanche.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.411
Sploosh.
Sploosh.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.715
Sorry?
Is I bet the sound
an avalanche makes.

04:09.717 --> 04:13.418
Uh, no, it's more like
a freight train full
of tornadoes,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.587
Which are in turn
full of smaller freight trains.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.923
Which are in turn
full of shit.
Sorry?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.423
She just had a baby.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.759
Ya know...
I didn't.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.094
Okay, well, we've got

04:22.096 --> 04:23.528
An extremely difficult climb
tomorrow, guys,

04:23.530 --> 04:25.230
So you might wanna
take it easy on the...

04:25.232 --> 04:30.636
[slurp]
c'mon, if you've climbed it...

04:30.638 --> 04:32.104
How hard can it be?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.872
[annoyed sigh]

04:35.208 --> 04:38.110
[crash]
die totenspitz...

04:38.112 --> 04:41.713
For those of you who don't speak
german, that means...

04:41.715 --> 04:45.550
Herr hessler?
Ze peak... Of death.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.252
Fifteen thousand feet

04:47.254 --> 04:49.288
Of some of the most dangerous
climbing in all of europe.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.125
Unstable seracs, frequent
avalanches, and hundreds
of crevasses

04:53.127 --> 04:56.628
That can swallow entire climbing
parties in a split-second.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.397
One in every seven climbers

04:58.399 --> 05:00.999
Who has dared to climb
die totenspitz

05:01.001 --> 05:02.834
Has paid
with his life.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.836
So yes,
she's earned her name, alri --

05:04.838 --> 05:08.307
[slurping]
[annoyed sigh]

05:08.309 --> 05:10.575
Okay people, I want
a good alpine start tomorrow,

05:10.577 --> 05:12.477
So pack your gear
and get some sleep.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.346
We head out at dawn.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.281
And that's a.M.?

05:16.283 --> 05:17.916
As opposed to?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.451
P.M. Dawn?

05:19.453 --> 05:23.121
Set adrift on memory bliss.
Come on, buddy.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.590
The mountain is dangerous...

05:25.592 --> 05:27.993
Very dangerous...

05:27.995 --> 05:31.630
So you should
watch your step.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.100
Okay,
great climb, everybody!

05:35.102 --> 05:37.436
Yaaaaaaay...

05:37.438 --> 05:41.506
So, instead of antagonizing
the person responsible
for our safety--

05:41.508 --> 05:43.041
What, shamelessly flirt
with him?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.776
Was it obvious?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.878
Maybe call malory
on the sat-phone,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.647
And find out who
the damn target is!

05:48.649 --> 05:51.650
One step ahead of you!

05:51.652 --> 05:54.886
May I please
have the sat-phone?
Rrrgh...

05:54.888 --> 05:56.455
It's mother's fault anyway,
lana,

05:56.457 --> 05:59.324
You're obviously
the one she should've --

05:59.326 --> 06:00.692
[malory]
<i>what?</i>
<i>Mother--</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:02.194
Hey, it's me,
quick question --

06:02.196 --> 06:03.628
[malory]
<i>let me guess --</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:05.697
Oh, how's a.J.?
Because if the rash came back,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.699
What she needs to --
shut up, please?

06:07.701 --> 06:10.402
Although actually yes,
how is a.J.?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.037
[malory]
<i>that's why you called?</i>

06:12.039 --> 06:14.039
Uh, no, actually
I'm calling because --

06:14.041 --> 06:15.707
[mallory]
<i>you haven't</i>
<i>the foggiest idea</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:18.009
<i>What it is you're</i>
<i>supposed to be doing.</i>

06:18.011 --> 06:19.878
Ugh, I know what, mother,
I just don't know--

06:19.880 --> 06:21.313
[malory]
<i>let me speak to lana.</i>

06:21.315 --> 06:23.215
Who?
[malory]
<i>lana!</i>

06:23.217 --> 06:25.584
No, I meant --
[malory]
<i>sterling, let me speak to--</i>

06:25.586 --> 06:27.886
No! Because you're gonna tell
her she's agent-in-command,

06:27.888 --> 06:30.355
So that when she's not
pathetically trying
to make me jealous

06:30.357 --> 06:33.024
By hitting on this idiot
beard-face sweater-model,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.926
She's gonna lord it over
me and ray,

06:34.928 --> 06:38.230
Who, by the way,
forgot to bring gum!

06:38.232 --> 06:39.698
[malory]
<i>are you finished?</i>

06:39.700 --> 06:41.600
Yes.
[malory]
<i>good, because...</i>

06:41.602 --> 06:43.869
[operator]
<i>the voice mailbox of...</i>

06:43.871 --> 06:45.837
<i>Elaborate voicemail hoax</i>

06:45.839 --> 06:47.038
<i>Is full.</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:51.042
<i>Goodbye.</i>
<i>[dial tone]</i>

06:51.044 --> 06:53.078
Huh.
I guess you had that coming.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.380
Wh-?
How so?
Gimme that...

06:55.382 --> 06:57.182
And if I wanted
to make you jealous--

06:57.184 --> 06:58.750
[carol]
<i>what?</i>

06:58.752 --> 07:00.452
Shut up.
Let me talk to malory.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.921
[carol]
<i>make me,</i>
<i>and also hang on.</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:05.190
What the stupid shit
are you doing?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.392
You said
you wanted watermelon!

07:07.394 --> 07:09.094
Watermelon's red?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.897
Wh-? Yes!
How do you not know that?

07:11.899 --> 07:14.433
Who am I,
charles fredric andrus?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.868
[clears throat]
she didn't come in today.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.069
[lana]
<i>well where is she?</i>

07:18.071 --> 07:20.572
Well,
I assume somewhere else.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.442
It's like...

07:23.444 --> 07:24.609
[krieger]
yeah, right?

07:24.611 --> 07:25.644
Ya find it?

07:25.646 --> 07:26.645
No...

07:26.647 --> 07:28.413
Find what?
Nothing.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.715
Just don't make
any sudden movements.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.451
Bowel or otherwise.

07:32.453 --> 07:36.421
Wh-? Why would we make
a sudden bowel movement?

07:36.423 --> 07:38.657
Don't worry about it.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.094
Rrgh! No answer at home,
no answer on her cell!

07:43.096 --> 07:45.931
So not only do we not know
who the target is,

07:45.933 --> 07:48.467
Now your mother
has absconded with my child!

07:48.469 --> 07:50.402
Yes,
but on the plus side,
there are seven of us,

07:50.404 --> 07:53.772
So if one out of seven climbers
dies on this mountain...

07:53.774 --> 07:55.173
Maybe we'll get lucky.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.108
Yeah, maybe it'll be you.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.310
No, not me, dummy,

07:58.312 --> 08:00.445
I meant-- oh,
I get it.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.747
I see what
you did there.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.983
Really?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.018
Yes.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.325
[lana]
c'mon, c'mon...

08:13.327 --> 08:14.960
Pick up, pick up, pick up--

08:14.962 --> 08:16.695
[pam]
<i>mmblello?</i>

08:16.697 --> 08:18.330
Oh thank god,
you're still at the office.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.664
<i>I am?</i>

08:19.666 --> 08:21.199
Aw, maaan...

08:21.201 --> 08:22.868
[lana]
<i>pam,</i>
<i>I need you to find--</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:24.302
Yaaagh!

08:24.304 --> 08:26.338
[lana]
<i>pam!</i>
<i>What? Goddammit!</i>

08:26.340 --> 08:28.206
[lana]
<i>I need you to--</i>
<i>shut up!</i>

08:28.208 --> 08:29.641
[lana]
--and listen!
I need you to check

08:29.643 --> 08:31.476
Malory's apartment
for me.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.544
[crash]
all right,
pick it up, people!

08:33.547 --> 08:36.181
The weather's good now
but it can change on a dime!

08:36.183 --> 08:38.517
Michiko, right there,
that's your line.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.620
Now, stay on it, and work
across toward the ridge.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.321
[winded]
hai, okay.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.490
Looking good guys,
looking real good!

08:45.492 --> 08:47.292
Oh, this old thing?
It's just --
keep walking.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.693
Uh-huh.
Yep.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.329
Sat-phone?
Yeah, sorry,
I was just--

08:51.331 --> 08:53.999
Keep it handy. I'm getting
a majorly weird vibe

08:54.001 --> 08:56.368
From um-- from
one of the other climbers.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.538
Oh, yeah, no, just tell him
you're not interested.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.640
No, not him,
one of the others.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.308
Yeah what's up,
what're we doing?

09:03.310 --> 09:06.077
Uh, besides jeopardizing
the entire rope line

09:06.079 --> 09:07.479
By being out of position?

09:07.481 --> 09:09.414
Yes,
obviously besides that.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.383
Crash has a bad feeling about
one of the other climbers.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.351
Oh, he's harmless,
just tell him--

09:13.353 --> 09:15.353
Not ray.
One of the others.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.023
Aha.
And also ah-who?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.991
Well, look,
maybe it's nothing, but--

09:19.993 --> 09:22.928
Get down!
You're not my supervi--!

09:26.666 --> 09:28.400
Oh, no!

09:36.108 --> 09:38.610
Hang on!

09:40.680 --> 09:44.249
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Hang on!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.751
I got a key,
ya skimpnuts.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.621
Oh yeah, me, too.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.357
Why do you have keys
to her apartment?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.758
Ron gave them to us,

09:53.760 --> 09:56.094
When they were doing
that weird open-house thing.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.429
Open marriage.

09:57.431 --> 10:01.299
Oh.
Well that explains that...

10:01.301 --> 10:04.603
You both had sex
with hopefully ron?

10:04.605 --> 10:05.937
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.439
But I just wanna say,

10:07.441 --> 10:09.140
Breaking into
ms. Archer's apartment

10:09.142 --> 10:10.809
To hopefully find
a crying baby

10:10.811 --> 10:12.577
Clinging to her dead
and shriveled body

10:12.579 --> 10:14.946
Is the best birthday present
I've ever gotten.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
[belches]

10:16.283 --> 10:18.783
Except for that
formula one team.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.720
Dibs on snacks.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.522
Looks like
pam's lucky night...

10:25.891 --> 10:29.127
Because of the snacks,
ya dickholes!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.763
Although...

10:31.765 --> 10:34.666
Michiko! Michikooooo!

10:34.668 --> 10:36.267
I can't see her!
There's a ledge!

10:36.269 --> 10:37.969
Hang on, I'm coming!

10:37.971 --> 10:39.504
Do not move!
Don't move!

10:39.506 --> 10:41.740
Everybody stay put,
keep the weight spread out!

10:41.742 --> 10:43.742
I'm gonna clip on,
abseil down on a v-thread,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.343
And try to reach her!

10:45.345 --> 10:48.446
I'm gonna blip blorp,
blobba-do dob onna beep borp,

10:48.448 --> 10:50.749
Check out mah beard!

10:50.751 --> 10:53.151
Little jealous?
Little bit, yeah.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.953
No no no, damn it!

10:54.955 --> 10:57.288
Guys, be ready
to pull on my command!

10:57.290 --> 10:59.357
And we gotta hurry.
A storm's coming!

10:59.359 --> 11:02.761
Um, should somebody
call the ghostbusters?

11:02.763 --> 11:06.831
Okay, here goes!
And pull on my command!

11:06.833 --> 11:09.668
So, will your feelings
be super-hurt if I bang him?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.336
[gillette]
yes!

11:11.338 --> 11:12.937
[cyril]
no, nothing in the study.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.106
Krieger, how about
the other guest bedroom?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.808
[krieger]
no, nothing.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.210
[cyril]
no sign of ms. Archer
or the baby...

11:19.212 --> 11:22.447
Pam, how about
in the kitchen? Pam?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.315
[pam]
[mouth full]
no, nothing.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.950
[cyril]
wh-? You better
be eating snacks!

11:25.952 --> 11:27.318
[pam]
ew!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.487
[krieger]
wait, yeah, where is carol?

11:29.489 --> 11:32.057
[carol]
growrrrf!

11:32.059 --> 11:35.894
Oh, god,
somebody kill me.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.530
We thought you threw up.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.498
Ew.
Ew.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.567
What're you--
is that a radish?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.803
And literally
the most fattening thing

11:44.805 --> 11:46.671
In the entire goddamn fridge.

11:46.673 --> 11:50.041
No wonder
she's so frickin skinny.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.976
[muffled]
everything else
is in plastic bags.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.912
What was that?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.714
Don't worry about it.

11:58.317 --> 11:59.317
[crash]
okay, ready?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.552
[all]
ready!

12:00.554 --> 12:01.953
[crash]
pull!

12:06.826 --> 12:09.594
[crash]
okay, okay!
Ease up, ease up...

12:09.596 --> 12:11.930
Was?!  <i>Wo ist michiko?!</i>

12:11.932 --> 12:13.264
She's dead.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.733
<i>Gott im himmel...</i>
<i>Dio mio...</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:17.569
The fall...
Must've broken her neck.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.003
Oh, my god...

12:19.005 --> 12:21.072
Well, now, that could be very
good for us.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.108
Japan? Axis power?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.843
Okay people, listen up!

12:24.845 --> 12:27.579
We've got a blizzard
rolling in on us right now!

12:27.581 --> 12:28.947
[crash]
there's no time to descend!

12:28.949 --> 12:31.616
We've gotta bivouac
right here, right now!

12:31.618 --> 12:33.184
C'mon, people, let's move!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.220
B-but, what about michiko?!

12:35.222 --> 12:36.554
You mean her body.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.956
But--
she's dead,

12:37.958 --> 12:39.691
But we're alive!
And you never let

12:39.693 --> 12:41.292
The dead jeopardize
the entire party!

12:41.294 --> 12:42.894
Now, you would know
that if you were

12:42.896 --> 12:45.196
An experienced climber
like you said you were!

12:45.198 --> 12:46.264
You think it's hessler?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.700
Axis power germany...

12:48.702 --> 12:50.368
Axis power Italy...

12:50.370 --> 12:53.238
[inhales]
then yeah, I dunno.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.706
Goddammit.

12:54.708 --> 12:55.940
Okay, listen up,
people!

12:55.942 --> 12:57.575
Now, we've only
got two bivvy tents!

12:57.577 --> 12:58.910
Ta-daaa!

12:58.912 --> 13:01.246
And two bivvy sacks!
But that's okay,

13:01.248 --> 13:02.981
Because it's gonna
hit 70 below,

13:02.983 --> 13:05.316
So if we wanna live,
we're gonna have to combine

13:05.318 --> 13:07.218
Our body heat.
Wait, do huh?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.087
So what we're gonna
do is strip down naked.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.122
We're gonna go three to a tent,
three to a bag!

13:11.124 --> 13:13.124
And I actually have some
thoughts on that,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.392
Who-should-go-where-wise!

13:14.394 --> 13:17.095
We go wiss him!
Americans go zair!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.830
Well, now, let's just hear
him out at least!

13:18.832 --> 13:20.098
(chuckling)
as if...

13:20.100 --> 13:21.633
No,
she was totally in there.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.967
Hurry up, dammit!
Get in your tent,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.636
Huddle up,
and hang on tight!

13:24.638 --> 13:26.137
The wind's probably
gonna hit a hundred miles --

13:26.139 --> 13:27.505
[ray]
shut the goddamn door!

13:27.507 --> 13:29.240
[lana]
what're you -- zip it up!

13:29.242 --> 13:32.644
[archer]
I am, obviously!
If you'd shut up!

13:34.246 --> 13:35.246
[lana]
wh-?! Nooope!

13:35.248 --> 13:36.948
[archer]
what?

13:36.950 --> 13:39.017
[lana]
I am not ridin' bitch
in this tent!

13:39.019 --> 13:40.585
[archer]
you have to!
It's the only way

13:40.587 --> 13:42.587
To keep ray's genitals
away from mine!

13:42.589 --> 13:43.955
[ray]
oh, as if!

13:43.957 --> 13:47.625
[lana]
uh-uh, no. No.
Ray is the dmz.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.360
[archer]
[annoyed sigh]
goddammit...

13:49.362 --> 13:50.795
Oh, please,
I oughta be worried

13:50.797 --> 13:52.931
About your dirty old junk
touching mine...

13:52.933 --> 13:55.033
Ray, if I ever
have sex with a man,

13:55.035 --> 13:58.369
It'll be a man
who remembers the gum.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.841
And, not that it matters,
also black.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.856
[archer]
[winded, muffled]
eat a dick, blizzard.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.224
Can you see anything?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.458
Besides snow?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.126
Yes, archer,
besides snow.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.928
Hang on...

14:25.064 --> 14:30.068
Hang on...
No.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.637
Well, now nobody's answering
their damn phones.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.339
I tried cyril,
pam, cheryl,

14:34.341 --> 14:35.807
Now I'm even
trying krieger!

14:35.809 --> 14:37.575
Where the hell
is everybody?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.344
<i>[ringtone]</i>
<i>â™ª teutonic butts</i>

14:39.346 --> 14:41.346
<i>â™ª teutonic butts</i>

14:41.348 --> 14:43.014
<i>â™ª white on white butts</i>

14:43.016 --> 14:44.883
<i>â™ª white on white butts</i>

14:44.885 --> 14:46.718
<i>â™ª [continuing]</i>

14:49.989 --> 14:54.259
[vomiting]

14:54.261 --> 14:55.827
Seriously,
I swear to god,

14:55.829 --> 14:58.229
Somebody please come in here
and kill me...

14:58.231 --> 15:00.698
I would if I had the strength,
dick!

15:00.700 --> 15:03.101
[cyril]
what'd I do?
You poisoned us!

15:03.103 --> 15:06.571
With that stupid ceviche
nobody asked you to bring!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.206
[cyril]
you asked me to bring it!

15:08.208 --> 15:11.442
I didn't know
what ceviche was!

15:11.444 --> 15:13.278
Uh, hey guys?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.046
What do you want?
What is it?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.615
I don't think
it was the ceviche...

15:17.617 --> 15:19.284
Huh.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.351
[lana]
what, can you
see something?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.686
Uh... Yeah.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.288
Well?
You wanna share it

15:23.290 --> 15:25.423
With the rest
of the-- jesus christ!

15:25.425 --> 15:27.692
[lana]
[shocked whisper]
that's hessler and savino...

15:27.694 --> 15:30.261
[archer]
who I think
just did our job for us,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.096
Because we are
out of axis powers.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.431
[crash]
mornin', gang!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.133
Who's ready
for a piping hot cup

15:35.135 --> 15:36.567
Of fair-trade practices?

15:36.569 --> 15:37.602
What the hell
happened to them?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.103
Hypothermia.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.272
No shit, they're naked
in the snow!

15:41.274 --> 15:43.308
It's called
paradoxical undressing.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.476
You see it sometimes
with severe hypothermia.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.879
The poor bastards
rip off all their clothes

15:47.881 --> 15:49.414
And run out into
the snow.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.915
With belts
on their necks?

15:50.917 --> 15:52.784
[coughs]
what's that?

15:52.786 --> 15:56.220
Oh. Yeah, man,
that hypothermia...

15:56.222 --> 15:58.389
Make ya do some
pretty crazy shit.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.425
But--
irish bastard!

16:00.427 --> 16:01.826
What?
What's that?

16:01.828 --> 16:04.662
Mccarran!
That's an irish name!

16:04.664 --> 16:08.132
Uh, yeah, scotch-irish,
but I'm actually canadian --

16:08.134 --> 16:10.802
Save the blarney
for the colleens, paddy!

16:10.804 --> 16:12.170
What?
Archer,
what're you --

16:12.172 --> 16:13.805
He's the target!
What?

16:13.807 --> 16:16.407
I just remembered,
from the dossier!

16:16.409 --> 16:19.277
Patrick mccarran,
mountain climbing enthusiast,

16:19.279 --> 16:20.745
Slash assassin!

16:20.747 --> 16:22.647
Okay,
first of all...

16:22.649 --> 16:23.614
Lana!
Lana!

16:23.616 --> 16:25.083
Yeah, that's true.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.119
Although I prefer the term
"cleaner" to "assassin."

16:28.121 --> 16:29.354
Well that's just smart
branding.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.189
And I'm actually canadian,
not irish.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.623
As is that.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.525
Those jagoffs
and the japanese broad

16:34.527 --> 16:36.327
Were from interpol.
They've been on me for months,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.997
But obviously didn't
know I was on to them.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.665
I sent her down
into that crevasse,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.867
Then went down in there
and broke her neck for her.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.303
Those two, well that's
kinda self-explanatory.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.537
They died in your arms...

16:46.539 --> 16:47.672
Hang on--
lana, hush.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.307
Yeah, shut up.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.343
I thought you three were just
some idiot wannabe tourists,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.846
But now...
Can I assume you're cia?

16:54.848 --> 16:57.448
No! You know what,
patty?
Hang on!

16:57.450 --> 16:58.716
Lana,
I said shut up.
I said shut up.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.352
And I said hang
the frickin shit on!

17:01.354 --> 17:02.787
Okay, god...

17:02.789 --> 17:05.690
So where
did you get axis power!

17:05.692 --> 17:07.125
Ireland?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.393
Again,
I'm actually canadian.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.396
And ireland
was not an axis power!

17:11.397 --> 17:13.364
You sure?

17:13.366 --> 17:16.200
They were neutral!
You asshole!

17:16.202 --> 17:18.002
Oh, that's right.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.204
(chuckling)
gaping asshole.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.205
Because I dunno what your plan
was with that gun,

17:22.208 --> 17:23.407
But there's about four feet
of new wet snow

17:23.410 --> 17:25.410
On top of the ice crust,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.744
So if you fire that thing,
I guarantee you

17:27.747 --> 17:29.547
It's gonna trigger
an avalanche.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.183
Well paddy, if there's
one thing I've learned...

17:32.185 --> 17:33.684
Wait, wait, archer?

17:33.686 --> 17:34.852
It's that there's
no guarantees

17:34.854 --> 17:36.487
In this crazy world.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.588
No, no, no,--

17:40.159 --> 17:43.327
I-- that-- you--
the-- that--

17:43.329 --> 17:45.496
I believe the phrase
you're searching for

17:45.498 --> 17:49.400
Is "thank you, archer.
That was--
[ground rumbling]

17:49.402 --> 17:50.835
What's that sound?
What was that?

17:50.837 --> 17:53.771
It's an avalanche!
You... You...

17:53.773 --> 17:57.909
And I believe the phrase
you're searching for is...

17:57.911 --> 17:59.077
Holy shit,
is that really an--

17:59.079 --> 18:01.946
[all]
[screaming]

18:01.948 --> 18:06.417
[archer]
avalanche!
Whoo-hoo!

18:21.266 --> 18:26.137
[phone ringing]

18:28.240 --> 18:30.908
And exactly what are you doing
with those bags?

18:30.910 --> 18:32.944
I don't live
on the sidewalk, you mope.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.046
Take them upstairs.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.447
<i>[lana]</i>
<i>where the hell is a.J.?</i>

18:36.449 --> 18:37.615
With me, she's fine.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.550
I was having
my apartment bug-bombed,

18:39.552 --> 18:40.952
So I took her
to the plaza.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.720
I'll call you back.
[phone beeps]

18:42.722 --> 18:46.624
And what fresh hell
is this?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.926
[lana]
can you believe that shit?

18:48.928 --> 18:52.096
Absconds with my child
and she'll call me back?

18:52.098 --> 18:55.066
No, seriously, I mean
can you believe that shit?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.735
[archer]
can you believe
this other shit?

18:58.971 --> 19:03.407
Peppermint patties!
Still warm!

19:03.409 --> 19:05.643
Plenty more where
that came fr--

19:05.645 --> 19:08.679
How could you possibly
be that excited

19:08.681 --> 19:10.781
To be in
a frickin avalanche?

19:10.783 --> 19:13.151
I have kind of a weird
bucket list.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.986
Number three,
bang joe frazier.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.522
[sigh]
really regret sharing
that with you...

19:17.524 --> 19:20.458
So, you think crash
is dead, or...?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.360
I mean, he'd have
to be, right?

19:22.362 --> 19:26.430
And either way...
I say we say he's dead.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.834
[mumbled agreement]

19:29.836 --> 19:31.936
Yeah, right?
Seems like a win-win.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.971
Unless you're him...

19:33.973 --> 19:35.306
Or the other three.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.341
But seriously,
how in the hell

19:37.343 --> 19:39.944
Did you think ireland
was an axis power?

19:39.946 --> 19:42.780
[chuckling]
oh, my god,
I think this whole time

19:42.782 --> 19:45.783
I was actually
thinking of romania...

19:45.785 --> 19:47.518
But only
as an inevitable consequence

19:47.520 --> 19:49.487
Of the molotov-ribbentrop pact

19:49.489 --> 19:51.889
And the soviet
invasion of bessarabia.
