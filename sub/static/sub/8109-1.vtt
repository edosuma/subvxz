02:39.993 --> 02:42.234
Dry heaves are
gone, so am I.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.944
I'll check with the doctor.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.452
No,no,no.
I'm here voluntarily.
Just got to check with me.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.750
I'm sorry.
Dr. Nolan left
specific instructions.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.791
She's not sick,
she's scared.
So tell her to tell...

02:56.885 --> 02:57.965
HOUSE: Wow.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.090
And he's black.

03:01.932 --> 03:05.516
Thought you'd be
a little more sensitive
on the slavery issue.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.353
You can't keep me.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.437
Dr. House,
you look a lot better.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.648
I am a lot better.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.324
No painkillers,
no hallucinations.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.027
Leg hurts,
but it's manageable.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.953
Great job.
Gonna miss you.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.031
Want to start missing you
as soon as possible.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.914
Well, legally, you're free
to go whenever you want,
but I suggest you stay.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.460
I'll take it
under advisement.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.834
If you thought
the hallucinations were
from your Vicodin problem,

03:36.925 --> 03:39.007
why didn't you
just check yourself
into a rehab facility?

03:39.094 --> 03:41.631
l was deluded into
thinking I might be crazy.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.838
But you have been
abusing Vicodin for years.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.218
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

03:46.309 --> 03:49.801
never had any problems,
other than narcissism
and anti-social behavior,

03:49.896 --> 03:53.309
until two colleagues
died, your father died.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.188
Your issues run
deeper than Vicodin.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.941
That's not gonna
cheer me up, is it?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.238
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

04:02.325 --> 04:04.111

talk therapy...

04:04.202 --> 04:05.487
Yeah. I get it.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.909
Just one thing
I'm getting hung up on.
I can leave whenever I want.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.082
How about | start with that?

04:12.794 --> 04:15.581
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.550
I don't want
to practice medicine.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.092
I've decided
I want to be
an astronaut.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.047
Well, if you want your
state astronaut's license,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.632
you're gonna need
my recommendation.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.849
Is that a popular
new treatment, blackmail?

04:33.523 --> 04:35.514
You need to get better.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.775
Welcome to Ward Six.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.789
So, brass tacks.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.496
What do l have to do and
how long do l have to be here?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.632
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.882
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.930
participate in group
and individual therapy,
we can work on goals...

05:09.017 --> 05:10.132
I set a goal.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.307
ExceHent
What is it?

05:11.394 --> 05:15.262
My goal is to get your boss
to write the letter that
I want him to write.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.517
Now let's talk process.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.270
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

05:19.361 --> 05:21.647
but there are
serious risks of violence
involved in that choice.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.354
So I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.486
making you and your
boss' job and life
so unmanageable

05:27.577 --> 05:30.660
that he'll write
whatever he has to
write to get rid of me.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.953
SAFER: He's all set.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.075
Thanks.

You believe these guys?

Lecturing me
on manic depression, like I
couldn't write a book or two.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.229
I stopped taking my meds
because I want to stop
taking my meds,

05:58.316 --> 06:02.104
because nothing is
wrong with me. No reason
to keep dragging me back here.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.528
When I'm on them,
everything slows down,
that's when the problem is.

Hey, nice to see you.

couldn't stand me.

but Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.198
Like the Woody Allen
character in Annie Hall,

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
So, what do I call you?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.880
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time?

she won't call
you anything.

in like 10 years
or something.

06:51.578 --> 06:55.036
Good you came here.
You need to know
the lay of the land.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.659

You're funny.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.829
You're also
gonna come here
to get your meds.

Good for you.

works too fast,

07:04.299 --> 07:06.881

he runs too fast.

Excuse me. I know
you're busy ignoring me,
but my mini-bar is empty.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.754
You think Bolt could
do the long jump?

needs to evolve,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.182

for like 20 years.

launched himself
head first

07:18.855 --> 07:21.767
and right before
he hits the ground does
a front flip instead,

07:21.858 --> 07:23.439
get three extra feet
out of that, easy.

that acting out will only
reinforce our diagnosis.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.984

this is something
we should be concerned about?

be concerned.

not just for the ladies...

just for the ladies.

You're claustrophobic.

to write this stuff down?

art therapy yesterday.

some of the new
pieces on the wall.

I'll be checking in with you
periodically to see if we
need to adjust your dose.

Trouble sleeping?

instigated the thing.

the way fights work.

of the same circumstances.

you compliment me,
it sounds like an accusation?

29:31.061 --> 29:34.019
You're not having
any side-effects from
your meds, which is unusual.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.186
It's not that unusual.

stop pretending that you
haven't reached a conclusion?

Actually, it's more
fundamental than that.

Yes.

So, what do you want me to do?
Want me to take a urine test?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.039

42:28.296 --> 42:29.877
We do enjoy it.

42:31.257 --> 42:35.546
Careful of the traffic.
Don't want to go
damaging any fenders.

42:37.597 --> 42:41.260
Hey! Hey!
Come on. Get down.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.515
There's no cry for help.
There's no cat in a tree.

42:49.901 --> 42:50.981
Thank you, Greg.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.605
No!

43:03.831 --> 43:05.696
NOLAN:
He's lucky to be alive.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.909
He's got a lacerated spleen,
rotational pelvic fracture,

43:10.004 --> 43:12.791
compound break
of the femur and humerus.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.628
Everything in your life
has been about finding
the truth,

43:16.719 --> 43:21.884
but suddenly, with this guy,
you decide to reinforce
a sick man's delusions.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.222
You just wanted to take
a swing at me. Hmm?

43:28.439 --> 43:32.023
You don't care
about getting out,
you don't care about him.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.066
You don't even
care about the truth.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.142
(LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY)

43:36.864 --> 43:39.150
You don't care
about anything, House.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.946
l'm transferring you
to Winslow Psychiatric.

43:43.037 --> 43:47.201
You'll have better luck
pulling the wool over
their eyes. I'm done.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.244
Don't.

43:54.549 --> 43:55.914
I need help.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.942
So, how is this
supposed to work?

44:17.029 --> 44:19.361
You sit. I sit. We talk.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.689
About what?
About whatever you want.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.399
You want me to whine
about my mother?

44:23.494 --> 44:25.951
Do you want to whine
about your mother?

44:26.038 --> 44:29.371
I could tell you about
the time I was five
and my goldfish died.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.995
If that's where
you'd like to start.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.826
I've had a billion things
happen to me in my life,

44:33.921 --> 44:35.582
how am I supposed
to know which ones
are relevant?

44:35.673 --> 44:37.334
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all relevant.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.917
Well, we better get moving
'cause this session
could take 50 years.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.298
Yes, you are the sum
of everything that's
happened to you,

44:47.602 --> 44:52.062
but the only way
we can figure out
which ones are is to talk.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.685
So, tell me,
what's on your mind?

44:55.651 --> 44:57.312
What do you want?

45:00.198 --> 45:01.984
I want to get better.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.112
Whatever the hell that means.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.202
I'm sick of being miserable.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.654
So you'd like to be happy?

45:09.749 --> 45:12.115
Again with the reflecting.
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.292
Being happy is
an excellent goal.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.243
Not many patients
can crystallize

45:16.339 --> 45:17.920
exactly what
they're hoping
to get out of this.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.338
Well, bully for me.

45:19.425 --> 45:21.416
So, now all
we have to do

45:21.510 --> 45:25.378
is figure out how
to get you from
here to happy.

45:27.558 --> 45:30.846
SSRls? That's your
genius technique?

45:30.937 --> 45:33.849
I don't think we
should ignore any
tools that can help.

45:33.940 --> 45:35.896
I know you don't
have a problem
taking drugs.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.894
For my leg. For pain.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.397
Well, think of this
as being for psychic pain.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.899
I don't want to
change who I am.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.028
Miserable?

45:51.791 --> 45:55.283
You think that by
taking meds you'll
lose your edge?

45:55.378 --> 45:59.121
Stop making the unique
connections that make you
a successful doctor?

45:59.215 --> 46:01.126
If Van Gogh
was your patient,

46:01.217 --> 46:03.959
he'd be satisfied
painting houses instead
of the Starry Night.

46:04.053 --> 46:08.012
Van Gogh would still be
making inspired paintings
of the night sky,

46:08.099 --> 46:10.340
just maybe not from
the room of his asylum.

46:10.434 --> 46:11.423
You don't know that.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.477
I know both his ears
would be intact.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.564
And I know his life
would be better.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.745
I know this doesn't
come naturally to you,

46:33.207 --> 46:37.541
but you want my help,
which means you need
to trust me.

46:48.264 --> 46:49.379
Hmm.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.384
Delicious.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.398
Why are you here?

47:05.364 --> 47:07.741
Waiting for my
communion wafer.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.372
You're cheeking it, right?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.207
Nope.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.668
Tell me you're
cheeking it.

47:21.464 --> 47:22.954
I swallowed it.

47:23.049 --> 47:24.459
No, you didn't.
We don't take meds.

47:24.550 --> 47:25.881
You don't take meds, Alvie.

47:25.968 --> 47:27.708
I decided to get sane.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.839
You're scamming again.
You can tell me.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.387
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.136
They broke you.

47:37.646 --> 47:41.059
They didn't break me.
I am broken.

47:43.778 --> 47:46.941
And stop worshipping me
and go worry about
your own loser life.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.494
I hate you.

48:03.881 --> 48:04.870
Prom?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.296
Got an assignment for you.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.920
Role playing?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.047
I'm not sure how
pretending to be
a businessman

48:11.138 --> 48:14.380
with a foot fetish
is going to help,
but I'm game.

48:14.475 --> 48:17.717
Have you connected
with any of the
other patients?

48:17.812 --> 48:19.052
You've been here
four weeks.

48:19.146 --> 48:22.479
Tell me about
your relationships
with the other patients.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.605
Diane is convinced
that Silent Girl hates her.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.401
Richter is not as
paranoid as you think,

48:28.489 --> 48:30.696
he just likes
that you think that,

48:30.783 --> 48:32.193
and my roommate hates me.

48:32.284 --> 48:33.444
Only one of the
things you said

48:33.536 --> 48:36.744
indicated how somebody else
feels about you. So...

48:38.916 --> 48:42.124
I'm sure
they've done some form
of rudimentary analysis on me,

48:42.211 --> 48:43.326
concluded that I'm a jerk.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.254
You know, there is a way
for them to find out
things about you

48:46.340 --> 48:48.171
without deductive reasoning.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.795
l have had relationships.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.921
You've screwed up
relationships.

48:52.012 --> 48:54.924
Every one of them.
Almost like that was the goal.

48:55.015 --> 48:59.554
I want you to trust people.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.307
Try.

49:06.527 --> 49:07.983
Get dressed.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.029
(BAND PLAYING JAZZ)

49:26.881 --> 49:28.371
Just open up?

49:30.384 --> 49:32.466
Just open up. Trust.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.593
Strangers?

49:34.722 --> 49:37.759
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

49:39.894 --> 49:43.227
If it helps,
I find "Hello" to be
an excellent ice breaker.

49:52.406 --> 49:53.566
Hi.

49:55.284 --> 49:56.569
Hi.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.152
It's like hello,
only shorter.

50:00.789 --> 50:01.915
Yes.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.665
Glad we were able
to save that time.

50:04.752 --> 50:07.835
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor,

50:07.922 --> 50:11.164
but the nervous demeanor says
maybe you've had issues,

50:11.258 --> 50:14.591
probably that's
why this place has
personal meaning.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.920
But this is supposed
to be about me.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.515
I take advantage
of my friends.

50:23.229 --> 50:25.971
Friend, really.
I've only got one.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.440
It can be tough sometimes.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.607
I'm not gay.

50:30.694 --> 50:31.683
Neither am I.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.440
Actually, I am.

50:33.989 --> 50:35.525
See that guy over there?

50:36.784 --> 50:40.026
He's my lover.
He's also my psychiatrist.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.111
Which some would argue
is a little inappropriate,

50:42.206 --> 50:45.448
but they just don't know
what love is. Am I right?

50:51.298 --> 50:53.254
You're not gay.
No.

50:53.342 --> 50:56.425
But I have to tell
intimate secrets
to people.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.754
Maybe they should be true.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.558
Hadn't thought of that.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.724
To be on the safe side,
I should probably do both.

51:03.811 --> 51:07.554
Starting with the fun ones.
Come on, let's get me better.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.437
(PATRONS CHATTERING SOFTLY)

51:17.408 --> 51:18.443
Hi.

51:18.993 --> 51:19.982
Hi.

51:23.998 --> 51:25.704
I'm a philanderer.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.161
Oh.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.288
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity,

51:30.379 --> 51:31.368
it means...

51:31.463 --> 51:32.839
I know what it means.

51:34.550 --> 51:38.668
You were asking me
if there were any nuts
in the hors d'oeuvres.

51:38.762 --> 51:39.842
What?

51:40.639 --> 51:41.845
Honey.

51:42.516 --> 51:44.723
What did my husband
just say to you?

51:47.688 --> 51:53.979
l was asking him
if there were nuts
in the hors d'oeuvres.

51:54.069 --> 51:55.605
Then where
is your EpiPen?

51:55.696 --> 51:56.776
My what?

51:56.864 --> 51:59.981
No one with an allergy
would walk around
without an EpiPen.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.360
Give me your purse.
No.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.113
Give me your purse.
Stop. No.

52:03.203 --> 52:06.616
VVhatreaHy
happenedis”.

52:07.750 --> 52:11.743
I thought he was cute.
I hit on him.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.043
We're going.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.632
NOLAN: You having fun?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.390
I did connect with one guy,

52:27.144 --> 52:30.932
but then my propensity
for screwing things up
overtook me.

52:31.065 --> 52:34.808
Then my desire to have fun
overcame my propensity.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.813
You didn't screw it up.

52:36.904 --> 52:40.146
The assignment wasn't
to get you to trust people
with a piece of your soul,

52:40.240 --> 52:43.448
the assignment
was to teach you
that you can trust.

52:44.787 --> 52:48.496
Did any of these people
rat you out as the
obnoxious womanizer

52:48.582 --> 52:51.574
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

52:52.878 --> 52:57.588
Why do you think that
people would treat you
worse if they knew the truth?

53:02.262 --> 53:03.968
Good night, Doctor.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.262
Are you in trouble?

53:11.605 --> 53:13.391
Apparently not.

53:13.482 --> 53:16.645
So, what's next?
You wanna be my pimp?

53:20.447 --> 53:22.438
Why don't we just talk?

53:23.909 --> 53:25.115
Okay.

53:27.162 --> 53:30.746
How come you weren't
pissed at me for
stealing your car?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.831
It was a nice thing to do.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.954
Hmm. I'm not sure about
the German-English
translation of "nice."

53:38.048 --> 53:43.338
The stealing was nice
or the ruining of
Freedom Master's life?

53:44.263 --> 53:48.757
What you did
was misguided
and irresponsible,

53:49.643 --> 53:51.429
but it was also nice.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.641
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

53:58.026 --> 54:01.484
You asked me why
I come here so often
to visit Annie.

54:03.157 --> 54:05.739
She was my best friend.

54:05.826 --> 54:10.160
Then she started pulling
away from everybody.

54:11.206 --> 54:13.322
The doctors don't know why.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.913
I think
I married her brother

54:17.004 --> 54:22.874
because he was the only
other one who was going
through the same thing.

54:25.179 --> 54:28.296
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

54:29.349 --> 54:32.477
| just couldn't stop.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.645
I miss her.

54:45.657 --> 54:47.158
I should go.

54:49.328 --> 54:50.784
Good night.

55:03.050 --> 55:04.415
Good night.

55:24.613 --> 55:26.319
So, what happened?

55:27.616 --> 55:28.696
You're talking to me now.

55:28.784 --> 55:30.024
No.

55:34.706 --> 55:36.116
(EXHALING)

55:37.251 --> 55:38.582
Was it fun?

55:41.505 --> 55:42.620
Yeah.

55:51.431 --> 55:52.967
She kissed me.

55:53.600 --> 55:57.969
Don't read into the phrasing.
We kissed each other.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.223
And how do you
feel about that?

55:59.314 --> 56:03.182
How do | feel about that?
It was a kiss.
Kisses are good things.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.229
Okay.

56:07.072 --> 56:08.608
That was a loaded "okay."

56:08.740 --> 56:10.571
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

56:10.659 --> 56:12.695
You're being judgmental.

56:13.287 --> 56:16.495
If I'd said that I had some
delicious Chilean sea bass
for dinner last night,

56:16.582 --> 56:18.368
would you say,
"And how do you
feel about that?"

56:18.458 --> 56:20.198
If the sea bass
was married, I might.

56:20.294 --> 56:22.706
(LAUGHS) See,
you're being judgmental.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.712
Isn't that against
your code or something?

56:25.799 --> 56:27.505
I'm simply
stating the obvious.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.879
lt's complicated,
not just because
she's married

56:29.970 --> 56:32.803
and notjust because
you're institutionalized.

56:32.890 --> 56:37.133
I know you spent the last
12 hours trying to figure
out what that kiss means.

56:38.687 --> 56:42.305
Who was that woman
you were with
in the parking lot?

56:42.941 --> 56:44.056
When you deflect,

56:44.151 --> 56:46.392
it's more effective when
you're not that transparent.

56:46.486 --> 56:49.068
Obviously you have
no problem with infidelity.

56:49.156 --> 56:53.570
You're trying to rationalize
that if it's okay for
your doctor, it's okay.

56:53.660 --> 56:56.037
Butjust for the record,
I am not having an affair.

56:56.163 --> 56:58.245
Then who is she?
Why do you think
you're working so hard

56:58.332 --> 57:00.072
to figure out the details
of my personal life?

57:00.167 --> 57:03.250
Might not have to work
so hard if there were
some personal items in here.

57:03.337 --> 57:06.750
You've got one number
on speed dial, it says "Dad."

57:06.840 --> 57:08.580
Come on,
how old are you?

57:08.675 --> 57:10.131
Why are you so afraid
to talk about this?

57:10.218 --> 57:12.630
I want to talk about you.

I'm taking advice from.

I'm not giving you advice,
I'm asking you questions.

meant a lot. I think
that scares you.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.051
I think there are
no personal items in here

57:20.145 --> 57:21.760

no personal life.

you and Lydia will end?

57:23.690 --> 57:25.601

every opportunity

only be happy so long

Philosophically speaking.

59:16.428 --> 59:19.886

your failures more
than your successes?

these cute deflections?

59:26.813 --> 59:31.056

someone screws them up.
Failures are forever.

59:34.154 --> 59:36.486
You accept that there's
nothing you can do?

Okay. I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.732
Now what can I do?

59:40.827 --> 59:44.991
You acknowledge failure
and you move past it.

59:45.624 --> 59:46.864
You apologize.

Wow.

Alvie, maybe you could
sing one of your songs.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:30.531
Eventually.
Why?

Because things pass.

1:02:33.833 --> 1:02:36.825
Things change,
doesn't mean they get better.

Diane, maybe you
and I can work together
and figure something out.

I can save him.

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:53.926
"They stole her voice box."
That's what he said.

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:56.136
That's what
she was staring at.

1:02:56.231 --> 1:02:57.562
That's why he's staring.

1:02:57.649 --> 1:02:59.310

1:02:59.401 --> 1:03:00.686

This is what you wanted.
This is what you needed.
A voice.

You thought you could cure
Silent Girl with this.

1:03:33.268 --> 1:03:36.260
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

I’m just a mess, yes!
Preach it to me, brother

1:15:52.757 --> 1:15:53.997
A life of restlessness

1:15:54.091 --> 1:15:55.877
But at least
we have each other!

1:15:55.968 --> 1:15:58.084
We got each other!
We got each other!

Usually, I open with that.

1:16:19.825 --> 1:16:21.986
Thanks for staying.

1:16:24.163 --> 1:16:26.905
So, what do you
want to talk about?

1:16:28.459 --> 1:16:30.290
Things are actually...

1:16:32.004 --> 1:16:33.665
Actually good.

1:16:33.756 --> 1:16:35.917
You're notjust saying
that because you don't
want to complain

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:38.875
in front of the guy
who just lost his father?

1:16:38.969 --> 1:16:40.345
I'm not that cured.

1:16:41.639 --> 1:16:43.675

in a dangerous situation,

to handle it.

1:17:25.766 --> 1:17:29.008

you don'tjust get
to slide right back

You have, but...

lsn't extending trust
part of the whole
"getting me better" thing?

If you insist on a pass,
I'll give it to you.

But I know where
you're going and I know you
haven't thought it through.

You didn't say anything.

And now Annie's leaving,
and I hear you're
going to Arizona.

Two things
just happened.

You got hurt, which means
you connected to someone else

1:24:18.971 --> 1:24:20.552
strongly enough to miss them.

And more important,
you recognized the pain

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:28.135
and came to talk to me,
instead of hiding from it
in a Vicodin bottle.

1:24:29.064 --> 1:24:32.056
The fact that
you're hurting
and you came here,

1:24:32.150 --> 1:24:35.642
the fact that you're
taking your meds, and
we're talking right now.

get some sleep.
