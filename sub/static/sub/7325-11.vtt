00:06.137 --> 00:07.308
IT'S A BIG DAY.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.140
YEAH.
I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.281
REALLY?

00:10.281 --> 00:11.612
MM.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.614
YOU FINALLY GONNA TELL
CRISTINA THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.546
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:15.546 --> 00:19.420
TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
OF YOUR FIRST TRIMESTER.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.722
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE PLANE CRASH.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.394
THE JUDGE COULD HAVE
A DECISION TODAY

00:23.394 --> 00:25.396
ABOUT WHETHER THE HOSPITAL
IS AT FAULT OR NOT.

00:25.396 --> 00:27.598
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.230
THE LAWYERS MOVED
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.133
WELL, THAT IS A FORMALITY.
THEN IT'S GONNA GO TO TRIAL.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.804
IT'S GONNA TAKE MONTHS
FOR A DECISION.

00:33.804 --> 00:35.306
MAYBE NOT.

00:35.306 --> 00:39.440
MEREDITH,
YOUR FIRST TRIMESTER IS OVER.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.142
LET'S FOCUS ON THAT.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.043
TRY AND RELAX A LITTLE BIT.
ENJOY IT.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.646
TELL YOUR TWISTED SISTER.
SHE'LL BE HAPPY FOR YOU.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.179
(Meredith) THE BIG DAY
IS HERE--

00:48.179 --> 00:49.480
THE DAY YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
THE NEWS,

00:49.480 --> 00:51.252
THE TEST RESULT.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.085
IS THE BIOPSY MALIGNANT
OR BENIGN?

00:54.085 --> 00:58.229
AM I GONNA LIVE OR DIE?

AH, GOD.
OH, MY GOD. UH...

01:07.598 --> 01:09.170
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.641
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE
CRISTINA, AND YOU'RE NOT.

01:10.641 --> 01:13.244
DEFINITELY NOT.
NO. (exhales)

01:13.244 --> 01:15.246
BECAUSE THEN
YOU CAN MOVE ON,

01:15.246 --> 01:16.407
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

01:16.407 --> 01:17.608
YOU DIDN'T?

01:17.608 --> 01:19.110
YEAH. (inhales sharply)
I DID.

OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

01:26.757 --> 01:28.119
GOD.

01:28.119 --> 01:31.162
IT'S NOT. (laughing)
IT'S HILARIOUS.

01:31.162 --> 01:33.194
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.595
IF YOU WEAR PANTS,
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AS MUCH.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.096
I JUST GOT UP.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.769
I WAS LOOKING FOR A GLASS
FOR WATER 'CAUSE I'M HUNG OVER.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.501
AND WHY ARE THERE NO GLASSES
OR--OR MUGS OR ANYTHING?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.333
YOU'RE PRETTY LOUD
FOR A HUNG-OVER GIRL.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.335
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
JUST FELT ME UP.

01:44.335 --> 01:46.337
AND I HAD TO SLEEP
ON YOUR LIVING ROOM FLOOR

01:46.337 --> 01:48.209
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO FURNITURE,

01:48.209 --> 01:49.310
AND NOW I HAVE A NECK ACHE.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.142
BEING YOUR FRIEND
IS BASICALLY RUINING MY LIFE.

01:51.142 --> 01:52.543
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

01:52.543 --> 01:53.814
YOU'RE A DOUCHE.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.546
GET A COUCH, OR I'M NEVER
DRINKING WITH YOU AGAIN.

LOOK, IF YOU'RE THIRSTY,
ALL YOU GOTTA DO

01:58.189 --> 02:00.221
IS STICK YOUR FACE
UNDER THE FAUCET.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.392
(laughs) OH, OKAY.

02:01.392 --> 02:02.723
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL

IT MEANS
THE HOSPITAL'S NEGLIGENT.

03:10.721 --> 03:13.364
IT MEANS
YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG.

03:13.364 --> 03:16.427
WHICH YOU DID.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.269
WELL, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN

SHE WANTS ME TO ASSESS HIS MOOD.
SHE THINKS HE'S DEPRESSED.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.566
LIKE "WAH-WAH"?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.669
HE'S NOT A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
HE'S THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

THAT I DON'T KNOW

CAN I TAG ALONG?

05:02.573 --> 05:05.476
I DON'T KNOW. UM...
SURE, I GUESS. COME ON.

05:05.476 --> 05:07.438
QUICK QUESTION
ABOUT THE CASE. (clears throat)

05:07.438 --> 05:09.009
(Steph) THAT...

05:09.009 --> 05:10.481
WAS GOOD.

05:10.481 --> 05:11.612
YOU LIKE THAT, THROWING
MURPHY ON MY SERVICE?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.043
AND MADE ME BEG
TO TAG ALONG.

05:13.043 --> 05:14.445
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S IN BOTH OF OUR INTERESTS

05:14.445 --> 05:15.946
TO KEEP THIS THING QUIET,
RIGHT?

05:15.946 --> 05:17.988
RELAX. DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WANT ANYONE TO THINK

05:17.988 --> 05:19.990
I'M GETTING SURGERIES BECAUSE
I'M SLEEPING WITH MY BOSS?

05:19.990 --> 05:24.024
I WANT TO GET THEM
BECAUSE OF MY AWESOMENESS.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.396
WELL, THAT'S TRUE,

05:25.396 --> 05:27.057
BECAUSE YOU ARE
EXTREMELY AWESOME.

05:27.057 --> 05:28.429

OH, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

05:30.361 --> 05:31.662

LAST TIME WAS,

TORRES--

OFF A POLE?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.560

06:29.560 --> 06:31.592
THEY INSTALLED IT
RIGHT IN THE BEDROOM.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.464
I WANTED IT TO BE
A SURPRISE.

06:33.464 --> 06:34.565
IT WAS.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.427
I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING
AN iPad.

06:36.427 --> 06:37.928

06:52.983 --> 06:54.915
WHAT ABOUT JACKSON?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.847
ARE YOU STILL PINING
OVER JACKSON?

06:56.847 --> 06:59.620
NO. (scoffs) GOD. NO.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.991
WHY? IS HE SEEING SOMEONE?

07:00.991 --> 07:02.693
APRIL, APRIL...

07:02.693 --> 07:04.595
JACKSON IS LIKE A COOKIE.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.127
PEOPLE WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT,
THEY DON'T EAT THE COOKIE.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.460
BUT THEN THEY GET SO HUNG UP

07:09.460 --> 07:10.661
ON NOT HAVING THE COOKIE

07:10.661 --> 07:12.703

IS ABOUT THE COOKIE.

07:12.703 --> 07:15.065
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS NOT ABOUT THE COOKIE.

07:15.065 --> 07:16.436
MM-HMM.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.838
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:17.838 --> 07:19.670
(ding)

07:19.670 --> 07:21.111
IS YOUR WHOLE LIFE
ABOUT THE COOKIE?

07:21.111 --> 07:22.473
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:22.473 --> 07:23.674
YOU AND OWEN, ARE YOU GUYS
A THING AGAIN OR...

07:25.145 --> 07:26.517
I DON'T KNOW.

07:26.517 --> 07:28.448
ALL I KNOW IS,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.080
HAVING SEX WITH A MAN
WHO USED TO BE YOUR HUSBAND

07:30.080 --> 07:31.952
IS WAY MORE FUN
THAN WHEN HE IS YOUR HUSBAND.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.083
THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW?

07:33.083 --> 07:35.756
THAT IS ALL I KNOW.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.859
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU... WANT TO TELL ME?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.931
NO. NOTHING I CAN
THINK OF.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.493
OKAY, THEN.
(ding)

07:42.493 --> 07:43.463
OKAY.
(cell phone buzzes)

07:43.463 --> 07:44.635
OH.

07:44.635 --> 07:45.796
(buzzes and beeps)

07:45.796 --> 07:47.067
HEY, CRISTINA.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.240
(cell phone ringing)

07:50.240 --> 07:52.573
AHH.
WHOA. NICE SHOT,
DR. SHEPHERD.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.805
YOU PUT A LITTLE SOMETHING
ON THAT BACKHAND?

07:54.805 --> 07:55.976
7 SERVING 2.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.748
HEY, DEREK.
ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

07:57.748 --> 07:58.779
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A GAME.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.611
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT ANYMORE.

08:00.611 --> 08:01.682
THE LAWYER CALLED,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.614
AND THEY NEED US
AT THE COURTHOUSE. NOW.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.222
DID I MISS IT?

08:12.222 --> 08:13.493
DAMN IT. I'M SORRY.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.165
I GOT OUT OF THE O.R.
AS FAST AS I COULD,

08:15.165 --> 08:17.568
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.

08:17.568 --> 08:18.799
OH, GOD.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.901
WAS IT BAD?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.603
IT WASN'T?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.734
WE WON.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.505
(Derek)
HE SAID THE AIRLINE COMPANY

08:25.505 --> 08:28.208
HAD A HISTORY OF MECHANICAL
PROBLEMS WITH THE PLANE.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.580
IT WAS IN PUBLIC RECORD,

08:29.580 --> 08:30.541
AND THE HOSPITAL
SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.512
HE FOUND
THE HOSPITAL NEGLIGENT.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.185
SO WE WON.

08:35.185 --> 08:36.717
WHEN'S HE GONNA TELL US
ABOUT THE AWARD?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.019
I MEAN... I HATE TO BE
ALL ABOUT THE MONEY--

08:39.019 --> 08:41.552
HE ALREADY DID.

08:41.552 --> 08:44.995
HE'S GIVING US
$15 MILLION.

08:44.995 --> 08:47.698
WHOA.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.560
EACH.

08:49.560 --> 09:01.912
(exhales)

09:05.746 --> 09:06.877
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW,

09:06.877 --> 09:09.980
THE HOSPITAL HANDS US
A CHECK FOR $15 MILLION?

09:09.980 --> 09:11.982
(woman) OH, WELL,
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY DOES,

09:11.982 --> 09:14.154
AND IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE
SOME TIME TO GET THROUGH

09:14.154 --> 09:16.556
ALL THE BUREAUCRATIC
RIGMAROLE, BUT, YEAH.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.728
PENDING APPEAL,

09:17.728 --> 09:19.830
THE INSURANCE COMPANY

09:19.830 --> 09:22.292
WILL ISSUE EACH OF YOU
A BIG CHECK.

09:23.794 --> 09:25.265
IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE
A PING-PONG BALL TO HIT.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.797
YEAH,
I GOTTA GET BACK, TOO.

09:26.797 --> 09:27.968
I HAVE
JAMES LEGGETT'S SURGERY.

09:27.968 --> 09:28.939
OH, HOW IS JAMES?

09:28.939 --> 09:30.300
(sighs) WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.042
YOU AND--AND MARK DID
HIS ORIGINAL CRANIAL EXPANSION.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.874
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
WHY IS EVERYONE RUSHING OFF?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.005
THIS IS A MOMENTOUS EVENT.

09:35.005 --> 09:38.909
SHOULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING,
LIKE CELEBRATE OR...

09:38.909 --> 09:40.911
OKAY, MAYBE "CELEBRATE'S"
TOO STRONG A WORD.

09:40.911 --> 09:41.982
DINNER.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.313
WE SHOULD HAVE A DINNER.
COME ON.

09:43.313 --> 09:45.215
WE'VE BEEN SITTING IN ROOMS
WITH EACH OTHER FOR MONTHS

09:45.215 --> 09:47.017
TALKING ABOUT THIS,
AND WE JUST WON.

09:47.017 --> 09:48.889
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SITTING
IN ONE MORE ROOM

09:48.889 --> 09:52.292
WITH--WITH FOOD
IN FRONT OF US?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.795
I'M GONNA DO A QUICK EXAM.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.926
(sighs and clicks tongue)

09:55.926 --> 09:57.668
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:57.668 --> 10:00.100
I WAS DOING A SEXY FLEXY,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.232
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I WAS ON THE FLOOR.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.934
A SEXY FLEXY?

10:03.934 --> 10:05.075
(sighs) IT'S A MOVE.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.077
I COULD DO IT PERFECTLY
IN CLASS.

10:07.077 --> 10:09.940
UH, UH, YOU HAVE A BRUISE
NEAR YOUR TAILBONE.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.012
YOU MUST HAVE LANDED
ON A HARD SURFACE.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.014
I LANDED ON MY HUSBAND.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.917
AND THERE WAS NOTHING HARD
ABOUT HIM.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.048
(door opens)

10:18.048 --> 10:20.791
LEONARD OLSEN, 67,
CAME IN VIA E.M.S.

10:20.791 --> 10:23.093
HIS WIFE WAS ON A STRIPPER POLE
AND FELL ON HIM

10:23.093 --> 10:26.957
WHILE TRYING TO EXECUTE A MOVE
CALLED A SEXY FLEXY.

10:26.957 --> 10:29.700
HIS PHYSICAL EXAM INDICATES
POSSIBLE INTERNAL INJURIES.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.363
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET
MR. OLSEN'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

10:33.363 --> 10:37.007
WHILE I ORDER A SCAN?

10:37.007 --> 10:38.168
SEE THAT?

10:38.168 --> 10:41.071
YOUR FACE?

10:41.071 --> 10:43.243
NOW IMAGINE HOW I FELT.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.875
(elevator bell dings)

10:44.875 --> 10:47.918
(motor whirring)

10:47.918 --> 10:50.320
WE COULD BUY A HOUSE.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.752
WE HAVE A HOUSE.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.923
WE COULD BUY
ANOTHER HOUSE.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.154
WE COULD BUY FIVE HOUSES.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.086
WE COULD BUY FIVE HOUSES

10:56.086 --> 10:57.888
WITH YARDS AS BIG
AS FOOTBALL FIELDS.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.030
WE COULD BUY THE TEAM
TO PLAY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.962
WHO WOULD PLAY AGAINST THEM?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.834
WELL,
WE'D BUY ANOTHER TEAM.

11:03.834 --> 11:04.995
MM.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.897
I JUST WANTED A HOUSE.

11:06.897 --> 11:08.098
MO' MONEY, MO' PROBLEMS.

11:08.098 --> 11:09.900
MM.
(bell dings)

11:09.900 --> 11:11.671
I SHOULD'VE BEEN ON
THAT DAMN PLANE.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.007
(computer beeps)

11:17.007 --> 11:18.979
JAMES WAS BORN
WITH CROUZON SYNDROME,

11:18.979 --> 11:20.450
A GENETIC DISORDER
CHARACTERIZED

11:20.450 --> 11:22.382
BY THE PREMATURE FUSION
OF CERTAIN SKULL BONES,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.014
RESULTING IN--

11:24.014 --> 11:25.986
A WEIRD-LOOKING FACE.
JAMES.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.057
FINE.

11:27.057 --> 11:28.759
A TALL NARROW HEAD,
WIDE-SET EYES,

11:28.759 --> 11:30.690
AND A SMALL MIDFACE.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.322
NOW OVER THE YEARS, DR. SLOAN
HAS OPERATED ON JAMES...

11:32.322 --> 11:34.294
(clicks keyboard keys)
FIVE SEPARATE TIMES TO--

11:34.294 --> 11:36.296
TRY AND MAKE ME
LESS WEIRD LOOKING.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.828
JAMES.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.169
WHAT? EVEN SLOAN SAID
I WAS WEIRD LOOKING,

11:39.169 --> 11:40.270
AND YOU WORSHIPPED HIM.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.172
MY MOM THOUGHT SLOAN
WALKED ON WATER. NO PRESSURE.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.074
(woman)
DR. SLOAN WAS GREAT WITH HIM.

11:44.074 --> 11:45.876
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONE.

11:45.876 --> 11:48.038
I KNOW, AND I KNOW THAT
THIS ISN'T EASY,

11:48.038 --> 11:49.740
TRUSTING THE NEW GUY.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.341
YOU WERE SLOAN'S GUY.
THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO KNOW.

11:51.341 --> 11:53.413
THE ONLY PERSON WHO LIKED SLOAN
MORE THAN MY MOM WAS MY DAD.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.915
AGAIN...

11:54.915 --> 11:56.787
NO PRESSURE. I GOT IT.
OKAY.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.389
I KNOW THAT DR. SLOAN'S PLAN
CALLED FOR THIS FINAL OPERATION

11:59.389 --> 12:03.323
TO CONSIST OF SIMPLY MOVING
THE UPPER JAW FORWARD.
(click)

12:03.323 --> 12:04.494
(beeps)

12:04.494 --> 12:06.156
I AM RECOMMENDING
A MONOBLOC ADVANCEMENT,

12:06.156 --> 12:08.298
WHICH MEANS, DR. EDWARDS?

12:08.298 --> 12:10.931
CUTTING INTO YOUR SKULL
AND MOVING THE WHOLE MIDFACE...
(click)

12:10.931 --> 12:12.963
(beep)
FORWARD IN ONE BLOCK.

12:12.963 --> 12:14.134
EXCELLENT JOB, DR. EDWARDS.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.265
THANK YOU, DR. AVERY.

12:15.265 --> 12:17.107
UH... (clears throat)
IF THIS IS A BETTER PROCEDURE,

12:17.107 --> 12:18.408
WHY DIDN'T SLOAN SUGGEST IT?

12:18.408 --> 12:21.271
FOR ONE THING, DR. SLOAN
DID NOT ANTICIPATE

12:21.271 --> 12:22.813
THAT JAMES' FOREHEAD
WOULD STILL BE

12:22.813 --> 12:24.875
THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY
UNDERDEVELOPED.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.817
HEY, EVERYBODY.
SORRY I'M LATE.

12:26.817 --> 12:28.218
WHAT'S UP?

12:28.218 --> 12:32.783
DR. AVERY WAS JUST EXPLAINING
THE NEW PLAN.

12:32.783 --> 12:33.954
MARK HAD A PLAN.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.155
AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN,

12:35.155 --> 12:36.126
WHICH GIVES JAMES
A MORE NORMAL APPEARANCE.

12:36.126 --> 12:37.858
BUT MARK KNEW JAMES
FOR 16 YEARS.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.830
YOU'VE KNOWN HIM FOR, LIKE,
UH, 16 MINUTES.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.161
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF MARK WAS HERE,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.163
THEN I WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE
THIS ARGUMENT WITH HIM.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.965
HE WAS A PLASTIC SURGEON.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.496
THIS NOT YOUR AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.899
SO IF YOU WANT ME TO WALK YOU
THROUGH MY THOUGHT PROCESS,

12:48.899 --> 12:51.001
I GUESS I CAN DO THAT
AS A COURTESY.

12:51.001 --> 12:52.142
WHAT I'M NOT GONNA DO IS
STAND HERE AND ARGUE WITH YOU

12:52.142 --> 12:53.303
ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE.

12:53.303 --> 12:54.474
THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.847
YOU'LL WALK ME THROUGH
YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS

12:56.847 --> 12:58.148
AS A COURTESY?

12:58.148 --> 12:59.810
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.251
(elevator bell dings)

13:01.251 --> 13:03.013
I'LL WAIT.
ALL RIGHT.

13:03.013 --> 13:04.314
I'M JUST NOT READY
FOR CALLIE'S DINNER TONIGHT.

13:04.314 --> 13:05.485
IT'S TOO WEIRD.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.017
I KNOW.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

13:07.017 --> 13:08.558
TILL THESE PARASITES
ARE HITTING US UP FOR A LUNG?

13:08.558 --> 13:10.290
DR. GREY.
THAT WAS FAST.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.461
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.
I HAVE A PATIENT.

13:11.461 --> 13:12.792
SHE'S
A 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE KID,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.124
NAUSEATED
WITH A DISTENDED STOMACH.

13:14.124 --> 13:16.226
AND SHE SAYS THERE'S NO WAY
THAT SHE'S PREGNANT.

13:16.226 --> 13:17.567
OH, EVERYBODY ALWAYS
SAYS THAT,

13:17.567 --> 13:19.129
AND THEN THEY ALWAYS
END UP PREGNANT.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.471
OKAY, BUT IF THE PREGNANCY
TEST IS NEGATIVE?

13:21.471 --> 13:22.833
(elevator bell dings)
OKAY, I WILL COME WITH YOU.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.935
BUT I AM NOT TAKING POINT,
YOU ARE.

13:24.935 --> 13:26.206
(indistinct conversations)

13:26.206 --> 13:28.308
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THAT REALLY IS A PROBLEM,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.380
PEOPLE CLAIMING
NOT TO BE PREGNANT

13:30.380 --> 13:33.143
WHEN THEY REALLYARE.

13:33.143 --> 13:34.314
YOU KNOW?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.345
OF COURSE I KNOW.

13:35.345 --> 13:37.247
HER BOOBS GOT HUGE
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO,

13:37.247 --> 13:38.488
AND SHE'S EATING
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

13:38.488 --> 13:39.589
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

13:39.589 --> 13:41.491
NO, BUT... SHE KNOWS
I KNOW.

13:41.491 --> 13:44.824
SO YOU KNOW SHE KNOWS
THAT YOU KNOW?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.156
MM-HMM.

13:46.156 --> 13:48.028
SHE'LL TELL ME WHEN SHE'S
READY TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.199
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:49.199 --> 13:50.160
MM-HMM.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.002
(indistinct conversations
continue)

13:52.002 --> 13:54.364
TAYLOR?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.437
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.839
OF COURSE SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.372
TAYLOR KNOWS BETTER
THAN TO BRING BOYS HOME.

14:02.372 --> 14:04.214
SHE KNOWS SHE NEEDS
TO FOCUS ON HER STUDIES.

14:04.214 --> 14:05.575
GET YOUR HAIR
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

14:05.575 --> 14:08.278
TAYLOR, DO YOU MIND IF I
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR STOMACH?

14:08.278 --> 14:11.221
OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE
A LOOK. YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

14:19.890 --> 14:22.192
DOES THAT HURT?

14:22.192 --> 14:24.594
HAVE YOU BEEN CONSTIPATED?

14:24.594 --> 14:26.296
(under breath)
I DON'T KNOW.

14:26.296 --> 14:28.198
SPEAK UP. NO ONE CAN
HEAR YOU WHEN YOU'RE MUMBLING.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.369
(louder) YES.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.340
YES, WHAT?
YES, YOU'RE CONSTIPATED?

14:30.340 --> 14:31.902
THE DOCTORS
AREN'T MIND READERS.

14:31.902 --> 14:33.203
OKAY,
SHE'S NOT CONSTIPATED.

14:33.203 --> 14:34.544
OKAY.
SHE'S JUST THROWING UP.

14:34.544 --> 14:36.576
MRS. LANZ, DO YOU MIND
IF WE STEP OUTSIDE

14:36.576 --> 14:37.948
WHILE THE DOCTOR
EXAMINES TAYLOR?

14:37.948 --> 14:39.379
TAYLOR DOESN'T MIND
IF I STAY. DO YOU?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.450
OH, IT'LL JUST TAKE
A SECOND.

14:43.353 --> 14:44.884
WOW.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.256
THAT WAS AWESOME.

14:46.256 --> 14:47.517
SO...

14:47.517 --> 14:49.219
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO THE PATIENT, NOT THE MOTHER.

14:49.219 --> 14:51.121
IF THE MOTHER INTERRUPTS YOU,
YOU STOP HER.

14:51.121 --> 14:54.394
SO LET'S START AGAIN.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.166
ROBBINS IS CONCERNED.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.327
YEAH, WELL, SHE SHOULDN'T BE.
I'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

14:57.327 --> 14:58.368
I'VE GOT A SOLID PLAN.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.899
SO DID SLOAN.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.301
I DID JAMES' FIRST SURGERY
WITH MARK

15:01.301 --> 15:03.003
WHEN WE STILL LIVED
IN NEW YORK.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.374
YEAH, I KNOW. I'VE READ
THROUGH SLOAN'S NOTES.

15:04.374 --> 15:05.535
HOW OLD IS JAMES NOW?

15:05.535 --> 15:07.237
HE'S 16.

15:07.237 --> 15:08.378
WHEN YOU'RE 16, YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR S.A.T. SCORE,

15:08.378 --> 15:10.080
YOUR FUTURE.
YEAH, WELL, SO AM I.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.212
THIS IS GONNA IMPROVE
HIS APPEARANCE BY 5% TO 10%.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.184
BUT AT WHAT COST?
IT'S RISKIER.

15:14.184 --> 15:15.915
IT'S COMPLICATED
RECOVERY TIME.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.347
I WOULD
STICK WITH SLOAN'S PLAN.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.919
(ball bounces)

15:19.919 --> 15:21.251
OH, HEY.
HEY.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.552
I GOT A MESSAGE
ABOUT A CONSULT.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.554
OH, YEAH.
CHEST X-RAY CAME BACK.

15:24.554 --> 15:26.626
TURNED OUT TO BE HEARTBURN.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.358
OH, GOD. THERE'S...

15:28.358 --> 15:30.000
(whispers) WHY IS SHE
COMING OVER HERE?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.661
SHE'S ON MY SERVICE.
RELAX.

15:31.661 --> 15:33.503
(sighs)
DR. YANG,

15:33.503 --> 15:36.566
I DID ORTHOSTATICS
ON 21-14.

15:36.566 --> 15:39.439
HEY, YOU KNOW, UH,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.341
YOU KNOW, YOUR HAIR
AND HERS...

15:41.341 --> 15:43.043
OH.
YOU KNOW, FROM BEHIND
KIND OF--

15:43.043 --> 15:45.645
YEAH, NO.
TOTALLY HONEST MISTAKE.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.347
YEAH.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.179
OKAY, THESE RESULTS ARE WEIRD.
SCHEDULE A TILT TABLE TEST.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.380
MM.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.551
OHH.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.722
I SAID "RELAX,"
NOT MAKE IT WORSE.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.384
(laughs)
(whispers) GRABBY.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.256
(elevator bell dings)
(normal voice) JUST GRABBY.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.428
(both moan)

15:58.428 --> 16:00.060
WHAT?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.491
ARE YOU TRYING TO SEE IF IT'S
REALLY ME OR SOME INTERN?

16:01.491 --> 16:02.662
(laughs)

16:02.662 --> 16:04.394
I'M... RELIEVED.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.466
I HEARD ABOUT
THE JUDGMENT.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.438
YEAH?

16:11.201 --> 16:13.203
IT HASN'T REALLY
SUNK IN YET.

16:13.203 --> 16:15.975
HEY, WILL YOU COME TO
THIS THING WITH ME TONIGHT?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.108
UH, DEPENDS.
WHAT'S THE THING?

16:18.108 --> 16:19.579
OH, IT'S DUMB.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.711
CALLIE WANTS TO HAVE
A SURVIVORS DINNER.

16:21.711 --> 16:24.214
IT SOUNDS MORBID TO ME,
ACTUALLY.

16:24.214 --> 16:25.755
BUT IF YOU COME,
IT COULD BE FUN.

16:25.755 --> 16:28.318
I MEAN, I COULD GET DRUNK
AND DANCE ON A TABLE.

16:28.318 --> 16:29.659
(laughs)
PROMISE.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.421
THAT'S... I...

16:31.421 --> 16:33.393
SHEPHERD
DOESN'T WANT ME THERE.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.494
WHY?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.566
HE BLAMES ME.
AND--AND I GET IT.

16:36.566 --> 16:38.468
I'M THE BAD GUY.

16:38.468 --> 16:41.331
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO BE FORGIVEN.

16:41.331 --> 16:42.532
DON'T PLAY MARTYR.

16:42.532 --> 16:44.474
I'M NOT. I'M--
THIS IS--

16:44.474 --> 16:47.637
I AM PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE.

16:47.637 --> 16:50.140
SO IF SHEPHERD
DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND--

16:50.140 --> 16:52.712
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK DEREK SHEPHERD--

16:52.712 --> 16:54.144
MM. MM.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.316
(sighs deeply)

16:56.316 --> 16:58.448
LET'S JUST LEAVE THE CASE
AND THE CRASH

16:58.448 --> 17:00.090
IN THE PAST OUTSIDE,

17:00.090 --> 17:02.492
AND JUST BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

17:02.492 --> 17:04.754
JUST YOU AND ME.

17:04.754 --> 17:07.297
OKAY.

17:07.297 --> 17:08.458
(sighs)

17:08.458 --> 17:10.060
SO NOW WHAT?

17:10.060 --> 17:11.701
NOW...

17:11.701 --> 17:13.333
YOU TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.504
OKAY.

17:14.504 --> 17:16.166
(laughs)
YOU CAN TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.537
(both chuckle)

17:22.472 --> 17:24.144
BAILEY SAID I WOULD
FIND YOU HERE.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.146
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.148
WELL,
IT'S MY HALL OF HORRORS.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.150
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
ADELE USED TO CALL IT.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.183
MALIGNANT TERATOMA RESECTED
FROM A LIVER IN 1985.

17:33.183 --> 17:35.225
THIS THING IS 27 YEARS OLD?

17:35.225 --> 17:36.526
IT WAS THE FIRST
IN MY COLLECTION.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.228
I'M CATALOGING IT,

17:38.228 --> 17:40.530
AND THEN MEDICAL WASTE IS GONNA
COME AND TAKE IT ALL AWAY.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.061
I REMEMBER THIS GUY.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.663
THIS IS THE GUY WHO SWALLOWED
ALL THE PENNIES.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.064
THIS WAS MY INTERN YEAR.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.437
THAT'S RON NEWSOME.

17:47.437 --> 17:49.339
HE SWALLOWED THESE SCISSORS
A YEAR LATER.

17:49.339 --> 17:51.241
AND WHY DO YOU WANT
TO GET RID OF ALL THIS STUFF?

17:51.241 --> 17:52.542
WHAT DO YOU WANT, GREY?

17:52.542 --> 17:55.675
I CAME TO ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD
LIKE TO SCRUB IN ON A SURGERY.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.347
A VERY COOL CASE,
A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL

17:57.347 --> 17:58.508
WITH AN UNKNOWN MASS
IN HER ABDOMEN.

17:58.508 --> 18:00.610
I'M BUSY.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.112
RICHARD, I'M WORRIED.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.553
NO NEED TO WORRY.

18:03.553 --> 18:04.854
I'VE HEARD
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OPERATING.

18:04.854 --> 18:07.357
I'M FINE.
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.189
I NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.262
SO PLEASE LET ME DO
WHAT I'M DOING.

18:12.262 --> 18:13.663
OKAY.

18:16.266 --> 18:18.268
(indistinct conversations)

18:18.268 --> 18:19.769
YOU CALLED SHEPHERD ON ME?

18:19.769 --> 18:21.571
HE'S NOT
ON JAMES' CASE ANYMORE.

18:21.571 --> 18:23.203
HE'S A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE
AND A RESPECTED SURGEON,

18:23.203 --> 18:24.534
AND I--
AND I'M APLASTICSURGEON.

18:24.534 --> 18:27.277
HEY, UH, QUICK QUESTION
ABOUT THE SITTER FOR TONIGHT.

18:27.277 --> 18:28.278
UH, YEAH.
HOLD ON FOR ONE SECOND.

18:28.278 --> 18:29.709
WELL--
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE DINNER.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.880
IT JUST--
IT FEELS WEIRD.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.212
WE'RE DOING THE DINNER,
OKAY?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.813
UM, CURLY HAIR CAN'T SIT.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.185
SO I WAS GONNA...

18:36.616 --> 18:38.318
SO I WAS GONNA CALL
ART STUDENT,

18:38.318 --> 18:39.619
'CAUSE SHE'S FUN
AND SOFIA LOVES HER,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.321
BUT UNIBROW CLEANS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.852
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
LEARN THEIR NAMES,

18:42.852 --> 18:44.224
AND YOU SHOULD CALL CLAUDIA

18:44.224 --> 18:45.855
BECAUSE KELLI
HAS ONLY SAT FOR US ONCE,

18:45.855 --> 18:47.427
AND I DON'T WANT SOFIA
WITH SOMEONE NEW.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.329
GREAT. UM, CLAUDIA IS...
OKAY--

18:49.329 --> 18:50.630
UNIBROW.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.801
RIGHT.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.264
YEAH. THIS IS WHY I WENT
TO DEREK, OKAY?

18:54.264 --> 18:55.805
MARK KNEW JAMES. HE WAS
WITH HIM FROM THE BEGINNING.

18:55.805 --> 18:57.307
AND YOU'RE JUST
THE NEW BABYSITTER

18:57.307 --> 18:59.469
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE
WE KEEP THE EXTRA WIPES AT.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.171
I WAITED AROUND HERE FOR YOU
TO INSULT ME AGAIN?

19:01.171 --> 19:03.273
I'M SORRY.
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD MORNING.

19:03.273 --> 19:05.375
AND--BUT MARK WAS SO INVESTED
AND SO--

19:05.375 --> 19:07.247
I WAS COMING TO TELL YOU
THAT I CHANGED MY MIND.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.249
I'M NOW DOING THE PROCEDURE
SLOAN'S WAY.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.880
OH, GREAT. THANKS.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.223
SORRY.

19:13.223 --> 19:15.225
YOUR HUSBAND'S SCANS SHOW
THAT A RIB

19:15.225 --> 19:17.357
PUNCTURED HIS DIAPHRAGM
WHEN YOU...

19:17.357 --> 19:18.688
LANDED ON HIM.

19:18.688 --> 19:20.290
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO OPERATE,

19:20.290 --> 19:22.392
BUT I'M CONFIDENT
WE CAN FIX THE PROBLEM.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.534
OH, THANK GOD.
I FEEL SO TERRIBLE.

19:24.534 --> 19:25.935
HERE YOU GO, SHEILA.

19:25.935 --> 19:28.238
THIS WILL MAKE YOUR RIDE
TO RADIOLOGY MORE COMFORTABLE.

19:28.238 --> 19:29.899
MM-HMM.
(groans)

19:29.899 --> 19:31.271
NOW ABOUT THAT X-RAY--

19:31.271 --> 19:35.945
IS IT OKAY IF I HAVE
METAL ON MY... COOKIE?

19:35.945 --> 19:37.447
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.249
OH.

19:39.249 --> 19:43.253
(siren wailing)

19:43.253 --> 19:44.214
(gasps)

19:44.214 --> 19:47.217
YOU... BEDAZZLED YOUR VAGINA?

19:47.217 --> 19:49.419
IT'S CALLED VAJAZZLING.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.261
ALL THE STARS ARE DOING IT.

19:51.261 --> 19:53.763
OH, IT'S A BUTTERFLY.
(laughs) LOOK.

19:53.763 --> 19:57.267
THAT'S--THAT'S THE BODY
AND THOSE--THOSE ARE THE WINGS.

20:01.271 --> 20:02.432
THAT'S GAME. (sighs)

20:02.432 --> 20:03.773
YOU WIN AGAIN,
DR. SHEPHERD.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.635
WAIT. JUST STOP.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.807
GREAT. THIS WAS FUN.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.909
I THINK
YOU'RE LETTING ME WIN.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.741
YOU'RE A SMART MAN.

20:11.741 --> 20:13.413
I AM.
SO AM I.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.584
THAT'S WHY I'M ABSOLUTELY
LETTING YOU WIN.

20:14.584 --> 20:16.446
WHUPPING YOUR ASS WOULDN'T BE
A SMART MOVE,

20:16.446 --> 20:17.617
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE
A COMPETITIVE GUY

20:17.617 --> 20:18.888
WHO LIKES TO WIN.

20:18.888 --> 20:20.390
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS
A COMPETITIVE GUY, ROSS?

20:20.390 --> 20:21.891
A NEUROSURGEON.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.893
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE ONE.

20:23.893 --> 20:26.326
MM. SEE? I AM A SMART MAN,

20:26.326 --> 20:27.627
AND YOU ARE NOW GOADING ME.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.399
(huffs)
BUT YOU WON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU LOSE.

20:29.399 --> 20:30.660
OH, "WHEN" I LOSE?

20:30.660 --> 20:32.502
YOU'LL BE ANGRY
AND NEVER WANT TO SEE MY FACE.

20:32.502 --> 20:34.404
THAT WON'T HELP ME ON MY QUEST
TO BECOME YOU.

20:34.404 --> 20:35.835
YEAH, I'VE TOLD YOU,
IT'S CREEPY WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.337
SORRY.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.238
I NEED A REAL TEST,
ROSS, OKAY?

20:39.238 --> 20:42.842
DR. RAMSEY HAS A CHIARI
DECOMPRESSION TOMORROW,

20:42.842 --> 20:44.844
AND I'M SURE SHE NEEDS
SOMEONE TO HELP ASSIST.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.348
IF YOU BEAT ME IN THIS GAME,
I WILL PUT IN A...

20:48.348 --> 20:50.249
1-LOVE.
MM-HMM.

20:51.281 --> 20:52.782
IS THAT FOR ME? THANKS.

20:52.782 --> 20:56.856
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:56.856 --> 20:58.388
CATHERINE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:58.388 --> 20:59.559
I'M TAKING YOU TO LUNCH.

20:59.559 --> 21:03.363
WE HAVE RESERVATIONS
AT THE FIREFLY.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.435
I DON'T HAVE SURGERY
UNTIL LATER ON,

21:05.435 --> 21:07.297
AND I COULDN'T JUST SIT
IN MY HOTEL

21:07.297 --> 21:09.469
KNOWING THAT
YOU'RE 5 MILES AWAY

21:09.469 --> 21:10.770
AND I HAVEN'T LAID EYES
ON YOU.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.472
WELL, I'VE--
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.603
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO CHECK--

21:13.603 --> 21:15.605
RICHARD, JACKSON TOLD ME
YOU'RE NOT OPERATING.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.577
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

21:17.577 --> 21:19.709
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.551
YOU LOOK THIN.

21:21.551 --> 21:23.513
ARE YOU EATING?
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

21:23.513 --> 21:25.014
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE.

21:25.014 --> 21:26.856
SO YOU DON'T GET TO...

21:26.856 --> 21:28.788
MY WIFE DIED.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.490
WHILE I WAS CARRYING ON
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,

21:30.490 --> 21:31.891
MY WIFE DIED, CATHERINE.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.363
SO WHAT I'M EATING

21:33.363 --> 21:34.764
AND HOW I'M SLEEPING
IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

21:34.764 --> 21:35.925
I HAVEN'T RETURNED YOUR CALLS

21:35.925 --> 21:37.867
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO LUNCH.

21:37.867 --> 21:40.069
I DON'T WANT COOKIES.
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

21:44.334 --> 21:48.508
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME NOW,
GREY AND I HAVE A SURGERY.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.818
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR THE HOUSE?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.950
I'M SICK OF SITTING
ON THE FLOOR.

22:00.950 --> 22:01.921
NICE!

22:01.921 --> 22:03.893
(laughs) SHEPHERD SCORES.

22:03.893 --> 22:05.395
AH, WAITING OUT YANG.

22:05.395 --> 22:08.498
SHE'S GONNA BREAK DOWN
AND FURNISH THE WHOLE HOUSE.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.960
WHAT? IT'S GENIUS.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.403
YES!
YOU GOT IT SHEPHERD.

22:13.403 --> 22:14.504
(laughs)

22:14.504 --> 22:15.665
WILSON,
YOUR FRIEND'S CHOKING.

22:15.665 --> 22:16.836
YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS
INTERESTING?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.007
100 BUCKS SAYS SHANE WINS.

22:18.007 --> 22:19.369
YOU DON'T HAVE
100 BUCKS.

22:19.369 --> 22:21.471
I WON'T EAT FOR A MONTH.

22:21.471 --> 22:22.912
HEY. WHO'S, UH,
WHO'S WINNING?

22:22.912 --> 22:24.043
HE'S GOT SHANE
ON THE ROPES.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.676
PLEASE. SHEPHERD'S MEAT.
WATCH SHANE'S DEAD BALL.

22:26.676 --> 22:27.917
♪♪♪

22:27.917 --> 22:28.878
(Derek) AH!

22:28.878 --> 22:30.850
(laughs) THAT'S MY WRIST
IN THERE.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.582
WILSON, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO BACK DOWN.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.353

NOT IN OUR WELL-APPOINTED SUITE,
BUT ON THE BEACH.

31:36.665 --> 31:38.627
SO OFF TO THE BEACH
WE WENT,

31:38.627 --> 31:39.999
WHERE WE HAD SEX,

31:39.999 --> 31:43.532
AND I GOT SAND
UP IN MY... COOKIE.

31:43.532 --> 31:44.503
(elevator bell dings)
EW.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.035
YES, A VAGINA FULL OF SAND

31:46.035 --> 31:50.009
THAT GAVE ME A BAD,
BAD INFECTION,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.580
REQUIRING A TRIP
TO THE LOCAL DOCTOR,

31:51.580 --> 31:53.612
WHO CONFIRMED
THE INFECTION

31:53.612 --> 31:58.047
AND ALSO DIAGNOSED A FEW
SAND FLEA BITES ON MYBUTTOCK.

31:58.047 --> 32:00.119
YEAH, HIS WORD.BUTTOCK.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.920
HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY
THAT MYBUTTOCK

32:01.920 --> 32:03.522
WOULD BECOME VERY ITCHY,

32:03.522 --> 32:05.254
AND HE WAS RIGHT.

32:05.254 --> 32:08.227
SO A PAINFUL INFECTION
AND AN ITCHYBUTTOCK

32:08.227 --> 32:10.229
ARE WHAT I HAD
ON MY HONEYMOON.

32:10.229 --> 32:13.963
SO, NO, NO, I AM NOT A FAN
OF THE BEACH OR THE POLE

32:13.963 --> 32:15.934

32:15.934 --> 32:18.067
I AM A FAN OF A BED.

32:18.067 --> 32:20.509

32:20.509 --> 32:22.941

40:50.749 --> 40:51.880
(laughter)

40:51.880 --> 40:53.051
HUNT, COME OVER HERE.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.222
(Owen) I-I can't.

40:54.222 --> 40:56.525
I--IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

40:56.525 --> 40:58.527
I know that.
We're moving forward.

40:58.527 --> 41:00.128
Just please come over here
and have a drink.

41:00.128 --> 41:01.590
SHEPHERD, I--

41:01.590 --> 41:03.562
CRISTINA.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.894
TELL YOUR HUSBAND TO COME OVER
HERE AND HAVE A DRINK.

41:05.894 --> 41:07.596
(whispers) NO, NO.
HE'S NOT MY HUSBAND.

41:07.596 --> 41:09.067
(normal voice) I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.769
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE ARE, BUT...

41:10.769 --> 41:11.900
you know, it doesn't matter.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.843
All that matters now is that
I'm drunk and happy

41:14.843 --> 41:16.775
and I want you to be here

41:16.775 --> 41:18.507
DRUNK AND HAPPY WITH ME.

41:18.507 --> 41:21.209
PLUS THE BATHROOMS LOCK,
SO...

41:21.209 --> 41:22.851
(Derek mutters)

41:22.851 --> 41:24.883
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
JUST... LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT

41:24.883 --> 41:26.715
AND COME ON OVER
AND HAVE A DRINK.

41:26.715 --> 41:28.056
THEY SAY IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

41:28.056 --> 41:29.217
ANOTHER TIME.

41:29.217 --> 41:30.819
Enjoy your party.

41:30.819 --> 41:32.521
MM.
(beeps)

41:32.521 --> 41:33.822
BECAUSE ONCE YOU KNOW

41:33.822 --> 41:35.864
ABOUT THE TUMOR
OR THE PROGNOSIS,

41:35.864 --> 41:38.496
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.068
SO WHERE ARE WE AT?

41:40.068 --> 41:42.931
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
FOUND A LOOPHOLE.

41:42.931 --> 41:46.274
APPARENTLY THERE'S A RULE
THAT NO MORE THAN TWO ATTENDINGS

41:46.274 --> 41:48.637
ARE ALLOWED ON A MEDI PLANE.

41:48.637 --> 41:49.978
SO WHEN DR. ROBBINS TOOK

41:49.978 --> 41:52.681
DR. KAREV'S PLACE
ON THE FLIGHT...

41:52.681 --> 41:55.914
ANYWAY, THEY SAY
THEY AREN'T GONNA PAY.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.616
OKAY, SO WHO PAYS?

41:57.616 --> 41:58.787
WE DO.

41:58.787 --> 42:00.949
THE HOSPITAL.

42:00.949 --> 42:03.822
(huffs) WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF RESERVE.

42:03.822 --> 42:04.993
NO, WE DON'T.

42:04.993 --> 42:06.725
SO?

42:06.725 --> 42:08.827
WE GO BANKRUPT.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.099
THE HOSPITAL
CLOSES ITS DOORS.

42:11.099 --> 42:13.531
WILL YOU BE STRONG

42:13.531 --> 42:15.964
OR WILL YOU FALL APART?

42:15.964 --> 42:18.166
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.838
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WAIT.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.139
(Derek) OKAY, HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.841
ENJOY THE TIME YOU HAVE
BEFORE THE NEWS COMES.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.542
AROUND THE MOMMY.
AROUND THE MOMMY.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.945
YEP. IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.917
BABY!
(laughs)

42:28.917 --> 42:30.178
(camera shutter clicks)

42:30.178 --> 42:31.980
(all laugh)
