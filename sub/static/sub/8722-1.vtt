WEBVTT

00:45.879 --> 00:47.870
In all creatures great and small,

00:47.965 --> 00:50.877
there resides a spirit
of athletic competition.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.179
From the heights
of mt. Animalympus, the flame

00:57.349 --> 01:00.841
begins its journey through the four
corners of the animal kingdom,

01:00.936 --> 01:03.848
bringing with it drama, joy and sorrow

01:03.939 --> 01:06.851
the thrill of victory,
the agony of defeat.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.538
Farther, faster, furrier...

01:23.709 --> 01:27.873
The motto of the competing continents
of these first games.

01:37.014 --> 01:41.428
And now... live, via satellite
animalympics!

01:46.982 --> 01:49.394
The five rings of the paw print

01:49.526 --> 01:52.689
the symbol of world peace
through animal athletics.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.527
Presented by z-0-0,

01:54.656 --> 01:57.864
the network that brings out
the beast in sports!

03:10.107 --> 03:12.689
Hello. I'm Henry hummel,
your anchor turtle.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.443
From z-o-0 control, you're looking at
animal olympic island,

03:16.571 --> 03:19.187
setting for these first
animal summer games.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.612
Now, here's a look at some of
the events we'll be bringing you.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.700
In the marathon,
for the first time,

03:24.830 --> 03:26.946
a woman stands a chance
of beating a man.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.869
I'm Barbra warblers, and I'll be
bringing you the story.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.082
This girl has won every major
competition on her rise to stardom.

03:34.464 --> 03:38.377
Can dorrie turnell take home
the gold? We'll soon find out!

03:38.677 --> 03:40.793
Hello again, everybody! I'm keen hacksaw!

03:40.846 --> 03:43.929
You know, in gymnastics this year,
it looks like crowd pleaser

03:44.015 --> 03:46.051
Tatiana tushenko is gonna go all the way!

03:46.184 --> 03:47.799
And I've got Bob-sledding action,

03:47.894 --> 03:49.930
with Europe's famous calamari brothers!

03:50.439 --> 03:53.806
In swimming, Dean Wilson, a young
Californian, is one with the water.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.682
Hi, I'm Brenda springer,

03:55.777 --> 03:58.860
and I'll have all the exciting action
from animal olympic pool!

03:59.030 --> 04:03.023
In slalom and downhill,
Kurt wuffner is everyone's favorite!

04:03.827 --> 04:06.785
I'm rugs turkell,
and I'll be bringing you me

04:06.872 --> 04:10.990
as well as the story of an exciting
young track star - bolt Jenkins!

04:11.209 --> 04:12.870
Hi, I'm melé, and I'll bring you

04:12.961 --> 04:16.124
the down and dirty play of
the New York rats for you, yes?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.873
The parade of nations has begun.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.545
The olympic torchbearer will be here

04:21.720 --> 04:23.881
any second at paw print stadium,

04:24.014 --> 04:26.050
where a grazing room only crowd

04:26.183 --> 04:28.890
awaits the opening of these games.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.562
Now he's sweeping past
former animal greats

04:33.690 --> 04:36.523
in the corridor of champions.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.481
The seemingly endless waiting

04:43.617 --> 04:46.074
is almost over for these athletes.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.693
For some, the realization

04:48.872 --> 04:50.828
of a golden dream...

04:50.916 --> 04:53.703
For others, the pits.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.791
Now, with an opening statement,

04:55.879 --> 04:58.791
the mayor of animal olympic island.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.043
Uh... let... let the fur fly!

05:01.760 --> 05:04.877
Our opening event is the most
dramatic marathon ever run.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.971
How one gets ready for
a fourteen day race is beyond me.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.762
Perhaps our own Barbra warblers
at the starting line

05:10.852 --> 05:12.183
has the answer. Barbra.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.850
Hi, I'm Barbra warblers.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.108
What is it about the marathon
that generates such excitement?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.857
That it's the original olympic event?
I don't know.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.199
Just look at these legs.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.153
No, these are not my legs,
and, lucky for me.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.330
They belong to Europe's
celebrated rené fromage,

05:34.417 --> 05:36.954
whose long string of victories
make him the favorite

05:37.087 --> 05:39.453
in this first animal olympic marathon.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.747
I am in training always.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.874
In my life, I have no time for women.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.672
It is all run, run, run.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.841
Because of this, I am chased.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.968
Long distance running is determination,

05:54.145 --> 05:57.182
endurance, the wall.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.733
Viva la victory!

06:02.821 --> 06:07.110
Between rené and the gold
runs the shapely form of kit mambo.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.368
The hopes of women around the world
run with kit.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.157
The way to beat rené

06:13.290 --> 06:17.124
is to take a quick lead and
break his concentration.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.877
The aspirations
of these two great continents

06:20.964 --> 06:24.832
rest on the legs of these two
determined champions.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.794
We're about to start.
Let's set the field.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.883
From Europe, Sophia bulgawari;

06:31.057 --> 06:34.220
representing central America,
the rascal pepé rubanosa;

06:34.311 --> 06:36.427
out of Boulder, Colorado, Terry hornsby;

06:36.521 --> 06:38.637
and, of course, the favorites,
rené and kit.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.222
You're over the hill, old man.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.019
Who is she kidding?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.859
And there's the start!

06:45.071 --> 06:47.858
The runners are moving out
of paw print stadium.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.697
A classic struggle between super powers.

06:52.871 --> 06:53.871
Thank you, Barbra.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.321
Z-0-0's animal olympic coverage continues

06:56.416 --> 06:59.283
with the precision and beauty
of international gymnastics!

07:03.882 --> 07:05.964
Hello, again, everybody. I'm keen hacksaw

07:06.051 --> 07:07.962
with one of north America's
favorite minks.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.169
A great gymnast, Cora Lee Perrier,

07:10.263 --> 07:13.881
who's got the z-o-o on you report on the
international sweetheart of gymnastics,

07:13.975 --> 07:15.681
Tatiana tushenko.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.261
Tatiana, you began training
at an early age.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.556
Da. Where I'm from, everyone starts early.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.019
But I work harder.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.985
Even on vacation I work,
after school I work,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.148
weekends I work.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.648
Tatiana, surely a young person
like yourself

07:31.826 --> 07:33.032
has other interests.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.859
Da. I collect trophies.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.452
My own, of course.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.871
Tatiana toured north America last year,

07:38.959 --> 07:43.874
making friends and maintaining her
"nose to the grindstone" image.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.087
Technique, as well as
how her program relates to the music,

07:49.177 --> 07:52.260
is what the judges
are going to be looking for.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.777
A beautiful performance!

08:54.868 --> 08:57.655
Looks like eurasia's gonna
draw first gold here.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.283
Let's take a look
at it again on the replay.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.708
That's something I've never seen.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.039
Keen, what the crowd is seeing

09:07.130 --> 09:10.873
is a hundred and fifty years
of eurasian ballet tradition.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.461
Wrapped up in a neat little package
that could melt Siberia!

09:19.642 --> 09:21.473
Tushenko's coach, Bruno ursakov,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.973
is prepared for the worst
from these judges.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.350
And a perfect "10" for Tatiana tushenko!

09:27.150 --> 09:31.063
I'm not surprised. And neither is Tatiana!

09:36.159 --> 09:39.117
All righty, hey, here's an
interesting story on the "vault".

09:39.204 --> 09:42.867
You're looking at Lisa blintz,
Europe's big hope for a gold medal!

09:42.957 --> 09:44.868
Lisa hails from fattgart,

09:44.959 --> 09:48.998
where she's the exercise director
at a camp for obese kids!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.457
Lisa's doing a double sakahura,

09:53.551 --> 09:55.212
a back sumy somersault,

09:55.303 --> 09:58.261
and a handspring fly-away
in the lean-out position.

10:06.314 --> 10:10.307
She moved her tonnage well,
but Tatiana's got nothing to worry about.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.858
"4.5"?! Qoo-eee!

10:13.238 --> 10:14.853
That's gotta hurt!

10:17.325 --> 10:21.409
"4.5"? Is that her score or the
reading on the Richter scale?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.702
Up next, we got Bruce kwakimoto,

10:23.790 --> 10:26.327
an Asian gymnast who...
Well, he's the kinda guy

10:26.417 --> 10:27.873
who stands out in any crowd.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.417
Anybody see a red pen?

10:29.504 --> 10:32.211
Bruce finds himself through
the martial arts discipline

10:32.298 --> 10:35.256
of "no can do," which, it says,
helps him in gymnastics

10:35.385 --> 10:38.593
because it hardens the body,
and turns the mind inward.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.261
Okay, let's pick up on Bruce's routine.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.851
There's a quick series
of thrusts and parries...

10:49.274 --> 10:51.265
A classic zenku-machi pose.

10:53.361 --> 10:57.445
Oh, there's a great roundhouse kick called
"ma-washa-you-facey."

10:57.615 --> 11:00.402
Now, we have the last few
exercises in this unique

11:00.535 --> 11:02.196
gymnastic demonstration.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.364
There's a threatening "say-you-punki,"

11:04.455 --> 11:06.867
and there's a series of
rapid-fire fancy tumbles,

11:06.958 --> 11:08.869
as a humble but proud Bruce kwakimoto

11:08.960 --> 11:10.040
salutes the crowd

11:10.170 --> 11:13.879
and tries to pick up valuable
brownie points from the judges.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.429
Okay, a storm cloud of controversy
is swirling around this eurasian.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.843
She's the "grand dame" of the uneven bars,

11:24.934 --> 11:27.516
Ludmilla steponyourtoewa.
Her work in the circus

11:27.604 --> 11:29.845
with her animal olympic
weight-lifting husband

11:29.939 --> 11:32.851
raises the specter of
professionalism in these games.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.145
Hey, yankee, got a peanut?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.187
Ludmilla takes
full advantage of her weight

11:38.364 --> 11:40.855
and works these bars without mercy!

11:40.992 --> 11:43.984
She goes to a back hip circle,
a free hip with a full turn,

11:44.078 --> 11:45.864
another back hip circle... look out!

11:45.955 --> 11:49.038
That'll cost a couple of 10's...
Swings through a handstand...

11:49.125 --> 11:51.867
She's getting set for a
double flyaway dismount.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.078
Now she's got big trouble, keen.
She's losing it!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.752
She's got to be disappointed, keen.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.959
This kind of maneuver may be
perfectly appropriate in a circus,

12:01.095 --> 12:03.006
but it's gonna cost her points here.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.672
Coralie, where did she go wrong?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.219
Right there, keen.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.889
A little too strong, a little too heavy...

12:10.021 --> 12:12.854
The result - orbital velocity!

12:13.066 --> 12:17.355
There you see the heavy price
these athletes pay for their mistakes.

12:17.487 --> 12:21.901
With steponyourtoewa out of it,
a gold medal for Tatiana toshenko!

12:22.033 --> 12:23.739
So, Tatiana's formula,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.821
early training from a supportive family,

12:25.870 --> 12:29.533
and a government willing to subsidize
a potential superstar from birth

12:29.666 --> 12:31.452
yields gold!

12:33.920 --> 12:36.206
Looking at the men.
We've got Bruce kwakimoto,

12:36.297 --> 12:38.333
about to finish his routine on the rings.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.341
Now, he gets ready for his big dismount.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.334
Look at that height!

12:43.471 --> 12:45.052
Whoa! Beautiful landing,

12:45.181 --> 12:47.672
and a little something
extra for the crowd.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.393
Bruce needs 9.4 for a gold medal.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.349
And that 9.5 means

12:54.482 --> 12:57.189
a gold medal for the
Asian Bruce kwakimoto!

12:58.820 --> 13:01.857
Exciting gymnastic competition
here at paw print stadium.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.529
Everything we hoped it would be.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.153
For Cora Lee Perrier, I'm keen hacksaw.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.239
Back to z-0-o control and Henry hummel.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.654
This is z-0-0,

13:10.832 --> 13:14.324
the network that brings out the
"beast" in sports.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.830
Let's go to the z-0-0o copter,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.877
and to burnt Woody, for the big picture,

13:19.007 --> 13:21.714
and a tour of animal olympic island.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.297
Animal olympic island...

13:25.430 --> 13:27.842
Built on the large
continent of Atlantis...

13:27.974 --> 13:32.559
No expense was spared in creating
the complete athletic habitat.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.095
Hello, everybody. I'm burnt Woody.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.979
Let's go sightseeing, shall we?

13:37.066 --> 13:40.149
In the distance,
the five rings of paw print stadium.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.438
Below,
the 3500 kilometer 14-day marathon course,

13:44.615 --> 13:46.151
a challenge for any runner.

13:46.284 --> 13:50.277
Let's check in now with my favorite bird -
Barbra warblers.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.320
We're at about the 50 kilometer Mark.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.531
It's way too early to
make any predictions,

13:54.625 --> 13:57.742
but things are going pretty much
as expected for rené fromage.

13:57.879 --> 14:02.122
He's off to an easy lead with his long,
fluid stride.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.005
In a very disappointing
fifth position is kit mambo.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.844
Wait a minute, she's making a move...

14:10.808 --> 14:13.845
She passes third and fourth
position hornsby and rubanosa.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.807
She's putting away Sophia bulgawari...

14:20.485 --> 14:22.441
Passes again for second place.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.894
And now,
maybe we'll see the race we expected.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.105
That's it for now. Back to you, Burt!

14:28.576 --> 14:30.362
You know, these high-strung athletes

14:30.453 --> 14:32.739
competing in this
international pressure cooker

14:32.830 --> 14:34.115
need a way to blow off steam.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.823
There's my good friend hammer thrower,
yu fat ing...

14:36.918 --> 14:40.376
Keeping his massive arms in
shape on dogleg 18th hole.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.044
After an afternoon on the lakes,

14:42.173 --> 14:44.038
it's time to head home to the privacy

14:44.175 --> 14:47.133
and ultra-modern gracious
living here in olympic towers.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.468
0-0-0-0h, this is wonderful...

14:51.682 --> 14:55.140
Not so hard.
Don't forget I'm not in my shell now.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.691
And chef forest king
must provide for all tastes,

15:03.778 --> 15:05.268
whether you eat like a bird...

15:05.363 --> 15:10.198
I'd like a quarter wormer,
and a side of flies provencal.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.326
Or a horse.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.868
I'll have a big mess of holed oats there.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.365
This fuels the athletes,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.659
but the energy to run
animal olympic island

15:17.834 --> 15:20.496
with its sophisticated
communications facilities

15:20.670 --> 15:23.412
is generated both naturally
from the ocean depths

15:23.548 --> 15:27.791
and through the utilization
of sophisticated technology.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.466
Well,
we hope you enjoyed this little tour.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.840
Now to Barbra warblers.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.857
Could it have been only a few years ago

15:45.945 --> 15:48.482
that athletes were content
to wear gray sweat suits?

15:48.573 --> 15:52.361
Well, with modem athletic-wear, everyone
can feel like a gold medal winner,

15:52.493 --> 15:53.778
both on and off the field.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.828
Hi, everyone! I'm Barbra warblers.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.872
Recognize this great look?

16:00.251 --> 16:03.584
These are the sports
fashions of enrico pucci,

16:03.713 --> 16:06.375
favored by these athletes
for their elegance,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.708
durability and flexibility!

16:09.969 --> 16:12.460
Here's one of the real
superstars of these games,

16:12.680 --> 16:14.841
dorrie turnell keeps warm down to 40 below

16:15.141 --> 16:17.427
in one of pucci's two-piece icebreakers.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.142
Dorrie cuts a great figure,
on and off the ice.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.637
Let's get ready for all
the beauty and grace

16:22.732 --> 16:24.017
of olympic figure skating

16:24.150 --> 16:26.857
by welcoming one of the
all-time great skating stars

16:27.153 --> 16:29.394
and expert commentators, art antica.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.732
Thanks, Barbra.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.901
We've got some great skaters to show you,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.232
like this eurasian pair,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.739
Olga cluckinskyi and nikita krawlinoff,

16:36.871 --> 16:38.611
who recently tied the knot.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.157
The krawlinoffs have been
performing together for years,

16:42.251 --> 16:45.209
and appear to skate as one.
Really a joy to watch.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.087
You're watching two
and one-half revolutions!

17:30.174 --> 17:32.961
A beauty! What a spectacular program.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.634
A great moment for the krawlinoffs.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.131
Our congratulations to them.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.848
But this animal olympic skating
competition would be incomplete

17:40.935 --> 17:43.301
without the presence of dorrie turnell.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.227
Remember this emotional scene when
she won the junior world championship?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.896
The public can't get enough of this girl.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.320
For softest feathers yet

17:55.449 --> 17:58.862
get preenette! Pre-pre-pre-preenette!

18:01.831 --> 18:04.493
Mama, mama! Mama, mama, I want the doll!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.866
And here's her manager Robert pigwood.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.540
She's a... great property.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.709
Dorrie has a certain child-like
quality that gives her

18:12.883 --> 18:15.795
wide audience appeal.
I'm gonna make a fortune.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.549
I mean, dorrie's gonna be a wealthy
girl when this is all over with.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.556
She's been wowing
audiences coast to coast,

18:22.685 --> 18:26.849
touring with the ice parades.
But the skate cuts both ways...

18:28.858 --> 18:32.851
Sometimes I long for the
simplicity of my younger days.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.856
Ahhh...

18:35.364 --> 18:38.856
That's her...
On the ice now... dorrie turnell.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.493
I don't have that in my notes.
I like it!

19:28.626 --> 19:32.539
Oh, clearly a great recovery!

19:33.589 --> 19:36.752
Remember, this is an all-new
program for this great champion.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.378
Double axle, beautiful height.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.381
Watch this combination now...
Beautiful, coming out of that.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.054
A performance of
this caliber cannot be denied.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.592
And it's a gold medal for dorrie turnell!

19:47.770 --> 19:50.853
For art antica, I'm Barbra warblers!

19:56.862 --> 20:00.980
If you don't think this guy is
the most exciting thing in track today,

20:01.117 --> 20:02.573
you are mistaken.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.701
Bolt Jenkins, this is "zoo on you."

20:05.913 --> 20:07.995
He started life as a handbag...

20:08.124 --> 20:10.706
Was told he'd never walk again.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.998
He was born in a very wet part of town

20:14.755 --> 20:16.370
where the sun never shone...

20:16.507 --> 20:19.715
And the people went round
with their heads hung low...

20:19.802 --> 20:21.918
I grew up, you know,
in a sewer, you know...

20:22.012 --> 20:24.594
It was wet, you know,
like and dark, you know.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.926
He was born to lose...

20:27.143 --> 20:30.010
It was hard just stayin' alive.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.223
Well, he got up one morning
and he switched on his TV...

20:35.317 --> 20:37.774
Ironically, it was a z-o-o broadcast

20:37.862 --> 20:40.854
of Boris amphibianski's
record shattering high-jump

20:40.948 --> 20:42.813
that made this story possible.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.741
And he knew that's
the place he had to be

20:45.911 --> 20:48.027
so he got himself up

20:49.540 --> 20:51.826
he brushed himself down

20:52.710 --> 20:55.702
he read some books
and he oiled his brain

20:55.880 --> 20:58.872
he started to work and
he started to train

20:58.966 --> 21:01.924
and he knew he'd never
be the same again

21:02.094 --> 21:07.134
no more, were you born to lose

21:09.351 --> 21:10.841
hey, boy, what you gonna do...

21:10.936 --> 21:13.678
The only thing standing
between bolt and a gold medal

21:13.814 --> 21:16.146
is his idol Boris amphibianski.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.727
I invite you now to witness this
climactic moment in sports history.

21:20.863 --> 21:24.151
Amphibianski, jumping first,
has never looked better.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.111
Those frog's legs are well-seasoned,

21:26.202 --> 21:30.946
ready to jump into the frying pan
that is international competition.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.077
The bar is set at what
would be a world's record.

21:34.210 --> 21:38.795
Can you believe they're trying to
jump 77 and three-quarter feet?

21:38.881 --> 21:41.998
He's making his approach.
He looks confident.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.467
He plants his foot. He's up and...

21:49.725 --> 21:52.888
Uh, oh... he's got big trouble.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.055
It could be back to the pond
for this great champion.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.572
Look at the intense concentration
of this young contender.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.700
It all comes down to this...

22:14.875 --> 22:17.867
He's done it! Bolt Jenkins has done it!

22:17.962 --> 22:19.793
A new world's record!

22:19.880 --> 22:22.587
Just look at the expression
on that boy's face.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.796
Let's see it again!

22:23.884 --> 22:27.126
To clear this world record height
took every ounce of strength

22:27.263 --> 22:29.845
and coordination in
this young gator's body.

22:29.974 --> 22:34.434
But yet another challenge
faces this tenacious athlete.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.851
They've all missed it.

22:35.938 --> 22:41.103
But bolt Jenkins has one attempt
left to pole vault 180 feet,

22:41.235 --> 22:43.726
to another new world's record.

22:48.242 --> 22:51.609
Good plant, the snap's incredible!
He swings up well!

22:51.996 --> 22:53.111
He's done it again!

22:53.330 --> 22:58.495
Bolt Jenkins has literally this
day jumped his way to stardom!

22:58.586 --> 23:01.794
Hi, like, you know, I'm bolt Jenkins.
And I logged a lot of miles

23:01.881 --> 23:05.669
and downed a lot of bowls of gecko
flakes on my way to a gold medal.

23:05.885 --> 23:10.299
'Cause, 'cause, they gave me, like,
an extra boost when I needed it.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.143
Were the years of hard work worth it?

23:17.813 --> 23:22.307
I hope you aspiring athletes
take a good look at bolt Jenkins.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.316
You decide.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.358
There's gonna be a celebration

23:28.490 --> 23:31.482
we can see our ship's come in

23:31.702 --> 23:35.820
though we met some
competition on the way

23:37.833 --> 23:40.700
it was tiring, it was testing

23:41.003 --> 23:43.915
it was almost never ending

23:44.006 --> 23:48.875
but we all pulled through
and won the accolades

23:51.388 --> 23:56.303
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

23:57.811 --> 24:02.430
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

24:03.984 --> 24:08.899
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

24:09.990 --> 24:15.986
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

24:20.501 --> 24:24.210
we've made some friends along the way

24:26.882 --> 24:31.842
we've made some friends and
we made the people happy

24:31.971 --> 24:34.508
when we came in number one

24:35.140 --> 24:37.973
and so we've reached the finish

24:38.060 --> 24:41.473
all the races we have won

24:46.110 --> 24:48.897
it's been a long and lonely battle

24:48.988 --> 24:51.400
and we lost some on the way

24:51.991 --> 24:56.985
but the time has come to
hold our heads up high

24:57.871 --> 25:00.863
we had to beat 'em and defeat 'em

25:01.125 --> 25:03.992
but we never had to cheat 'em

25:04.253 --> 25:09.213
we're the champions
who've made it all the way

25:12.011 --> 25:16.471
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

25:17.975 --> 25:22.935
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

25:24.023 --> 25:28.983
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

25:30.195 --> 25:36.065
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

25:40.998 --> 25:44.991
we've made some friends along the way

25:47.087 --> 25:52.207
we've made some friends and
we made the people happy

25:52.342 --> 25:55.004
when we came in number one

25:55.596 --> 25:58.258
and so we've reached the finish

25:58.390 --> 26:02.224
all the races we have won!

26:22.539 --> 26:25.497
Huh, 46 seconds, not bad for a "fatso".

26:25.626 --> 26:27.662
Well, it's dawn here. It's serene.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.460
But in a few hours,
the speed merchants of these games

26:30.547 --> 26:33.254
are gonna explode down this
track in an awesome display

26:33.342 --> 26:35.799
of raw power that is the 100 meter dash.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.718
Okay, we're "live".

26:38.972 --> 26:41.679
In Lane one, the favorite,
the African kip lego-go.

26:42.142 --> 26:45.976
In Lane two,
the mysterious eurasian uri trutski.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.357
In third position,
gold medal winner bolt Jenkins.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.942
And rounding out the field
in this 100 meter dash,

26:54.029 --> 26:56.020
the diminutive European cosmo hopper.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.822
The continents are looking
for a quick gold medal here.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.991
It all happens in a couple of seconds.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.830
Kip needs to mine some African gold.

27:07.918 --> 27:11.410
And here to call the race is former
speedster Jackie fuelit. Jackie...

27:11.505 --> 27:12.335
Thank you, keen.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.208
The tension's been building all day,

27:14.299 --> 27:16.335
and I know we're gonna see a great race.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.880
Go-go on the inside is really gunning it.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.128
I hope he doesn't hand grenade his engine.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.464
That would be a terrible tragedy.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.974
It's only a matter of seconds now, keen.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.390
And there's the light.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.645
Look at the acceleration
of those top fuelers

27:34.736 --> 27:37.569
as they scream up the line.
Lego-go off at last.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.322
But there he goes.
He's got to catch bolt Jenkins.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.614
It's too close to call.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.000
Bolt Jenkins and kip
lego-go in a photo finish.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.001
Let's get them both over here
while we wait for the results.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.082
And the judges give it to bolt Jenkins

27:59.178 --> 28:02.090
in the record-breaking
time of 1.06 seconds.

28:04.141 --> 28:08.384
Bolt, congratulations on
another crackerjack performance.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.135
I can't accept this gold medal.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.012
I mean, he was better than me.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.266
Here, kip... you should get this.
I mean, I mean...

28:15.402 --> 28:16.562
I'm Jackie fuelit.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.358
To another important
race and Barbra warblers.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.194
We're at the 1000 kilometer
Mark in this marathon.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.401
René and kit have left
the pack far behind,

28:25.495 --> 28:26.905
setting a bone-rattling pace.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.237
For four grueling days,

28:28.332 --> 28:30.539
they've matched each
other stride for stride.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.163
I wonder what's running
through their minds.

28:40.177 --> 28:44.511
Viva la victory! Viva la victory!
Viva la victory!

28:48.685 --> 28:51.552
He's great. But I know I can beat him.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.692
It looks as if rené fromage
may have finally met his match.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.024
As they go into their
fourth night of running,

29:05.118 --> 29:08.030
neither one apparently
acknowledging the other's existence.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.987
How long can she keep this up?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.868
How long can he keep it up?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.788
This guy's an egomaniac.
But he's kind of cute.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.423
Another night of agony for these runners.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.342
But as night falls on
animal olympic island,

29:28.433 --> 29:31.300
other animals take a breather
from the intense competition

29:31.395 --> 29:33.135
by heading over to the "in" spot...

29:33.230 --> 29:34.595
Noah's ark disco.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.726
Work and work and work and work

29:41.863 --> 29:43.694
work and work and work and work

29:43.824 --> 29:45.564
work and work and work and work

29:45.701 --> 29:47.487
you gotta work, you gotta work

29:47.995 --> 29:50.077
friends will try to put you down

29:50.247 --> 29:51.737
go for it, go for it

29:51.873 --> 29:53.955
when you don't want to go to town

29:54.126 --> 29:55.787
go for it, go for it

29:55.919 --> 29:58.160
but if you want to sing this song

29:58.297 --> 29:59.787
go for it, go for it

29:59.923 --> 30:02.756
you gotta work out all night long

30:03.677 --> 30:07.920
you gotta go for it against the opposition

30:08.390 --> 30:11.928
go for it if you want to win the race

30:12.352 --> 30:16.061
go for it, it's really your decision

30:16.440 --> 30:20.149
go for it, you've gotta set the pace

30:20.277 --> 30:24.111
for inspiration we all
need a mama and a papa

30:24.406 --> 30:29.946
'cause to find a reason not to
work is easier than harder, yeah

30:30.620 --> 30:34.204
go for it against the opposition

30:34.708 --> 30:38.371
go for it if you want to win the race

30:38.754 --> 30:42.372
go for it, it's really your decision

30:42.632 --> 30:47.592
go for it,
you've gotta set the pace and work

31:22.005 --> 31:25.293
Hello again, everybody,
I'm keen hacksaw, with soccer expert melé.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.167
We got some exciting clips
from yesterday's match.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.549
Rolf schmecker,
captain of the European all-stars.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.593
I remember always the
words of my first coach...

31:34.726 --> 31:36.512
"Prepare, hope you win."

31:36.645 --> 31:39.512
Whiz Rizzo,
leader of the hard hitting New York rats.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.096
I remember what my coach said:

31:41.191 --> 31:43.933
"Ring his bell.
That'll knock the wind out of his sail.”

31:44.027 --> 31:46.359
But he went too far in this pivotal play.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.654
There's a whistle.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.705
We're gonna see a penalty shot by
captain schmecker in this scoreless game.

31:58.792 --> 31:59.792
Say!

32:00.210 --> 32:03.418
No,
a score as it gets past the rat's goalie.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.174
Let's pick up the action in today's game.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.169
The south American llamas
versus the undefeated dogs.

32:12.681 --> 32:16.173
The score is 1 to 1. Out of bounds,
the llamas' ball.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.395
A steal by frank weiner!

32:22.482 --> 32:24.598
A real opportunity deep
in llama territory.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.604
Quick pass to hans wolf.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.603
He fires off to the left wing.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.773
Centering pass to schencker. Bicycle shot!

32:32.993 --> 32:34.904
Score! As the time runs out,

32:34.995 --> 32:36.826
the Europeans take it - two to one!

32:37.205 --> 32:40.368
I said you cannot make a mistake
against a great team like this.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.456
Otherwise, they kill you.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.750
A much-deserved gold
medal for these Europeans.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.622
Now, to Henry hummel...

32:50.260 --> 32:53.673
Now, let's focus our attention
on the all-important marathon

32:53.805 --> 32:54.965
and Barbra warblers.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.891
Kit mambo and rené are at
the 2000 kilometer Mark.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.515
The friction between these
two great personalities

33:02.689 --> 33:04.350
is heating up to the flash point.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.897
One of them must make a move.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.976
Me and the course...
There is nothing else...

33:09.279 --> 33:10.985
But kit mambo.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.484
I have to beat rené...

33:13.617 --> 33:16.609
Even though he is a dreamboat.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.988
Don't throw it all away, rené.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.968
I've always run away

33:43.813 --> 33:46.896
from things that tie me down

33:47.817 --> 33:49.557
my life I love,

33:49.861 --> 33:52.978
but love's not for me

33:55.992 --> 33:58.950
I see my goal ahead

33:59.996 --> 34:02.988
with nothing in the way

34:03.875 --> 34:05.866
if love should come,

34:06.086 --> 34:08.793
then I'll run away

34:12.007 --> 34:15.967
I've always been the type of man

34:16.388 --> 34:20.380
who's dedicated to his cause

34:20.516 --> 34:23.884
and it's a lonely road I run

34:24.646 --> 34:27.978
but I'll stay faithful to my course

34:28.065 --> 34:31.308
there's only one direction

34:56.011 --> 34:59.970
There comes a time
when you must choose

35:00.724 --> 35:04.012
about the path you're gonna take

35:04.769 --> 35:08.603
and you must take it, win or lose

35:08.732 --> 35:11.974
and if you lose it's your mistake

35:12.068 --> 35:15.560
there's only one direction

35:15.989 --> 35:19.447
so when the race is won

35:19.993 --> 35:23.406
and there's nothing left to do

35:24.080 --> 35:28.540
alone again, but where are you?

35:32.047 --> 35:36.882
Alone again, but where are you?

35:44.309 --> 35:47.267
The gold...
The fulfillment of an athlete's dream.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.686
And,
speaking of the fulfillment of a dream...

35:49.856 --> 35:52.097
Here's former miss
pedigree north America...

35:52.192 --> 35:53.978
Brenda springer.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.691
I'm standing in front of the slalom course

36:02.786 --> 36:05.243
with former all-Scandinavian ski champion

36:05.330 --> 36:07.867
and now film star, bjorn freeborg.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.991
Bjorn is starring in cries and whinnies,

36:11.127 --> 36:13.869
ingmar birdman's upcoming picture.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.916
Can we see the clip?

36:16.007 --> 36:20.000
I remember as a little boy by the seaside,

36:20.178 --> 36:23.921
it was a game I knew I had won...

36:23.973 --> 36:26.965
Well, bjorn, that's two careers on ice!

36:27.060 --> 36:29.642
Brenda, earlier today,

36:29.771 --> 36:33.104
we saw the young north
American Jimmy ribbet.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.440
You see him hook a tip.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.361
Most skiers would be down by now.

36:39.447 --> 36:43.440
But ribbet is still thinking
ahead to the next gate.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.910
Looks like north America's gonna
have to wait a little longer

36:55.004 --> 36:56.494
for a gold medal.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.706
The big story this year in skiing

36:58.800 --> 37:02.088
is Kurt wuffner with all
of Europe expecting him

37:02.178 --> 37:03.793
to bring home the gold.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.885
Let's get to know this
half-dog alpine guy.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.970
Skiing free on the top
of the world is my whole life.

37:13.106 --> 37:16.223
I can ski where no dog
has ever skied before.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.687
No slope is beyond my reach.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.323
Having the right equipment helps.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.952
Up here, I feel I am where I belong,

37:29.497 --> 37:33.160
but I will go anyplace
that challenges my skiing.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.001
This maneuver really
ticked off some people

37:37.088 --> 37:39.625
who run the animal trade center.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.626
We're live.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.844
The pressure's really on this
guy as he psyches himself up.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.420
Strong start.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.840
He's the only one left who stands a chance

37:49.976 --> 37:52.012
of beating the leading time.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.761
He's got his back on every pole.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.732
He's really pushing through
on these last few gates.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.984
"51.23" - he's done it!

38:09.329 --> 38:10.990
Well, not quite.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.991
He's still got the downhill.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.822
Let's look at it again.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.244
This is the gate where
Jimmy ribbit hooked his tip.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.621
No problem for wuffner.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.874
Now to Henry hummel...

38:27.972 --> 38:29.758
Let me take you on a gondola tour

38:29.974 --> 38:31.885
over picturesque squawk valley,

38:31.976 --> 38:33.967
nestled in the shadow of mt. Mammoth.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.098
On your left, animal kingdome,

38:36.272 --> 38:39.685
setting for brutal head-on
hockey competition.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.934
There's the admiral byrd hotel...

38:42.987 --> 38:45.945
There is 2-0-0 control, where I am.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.989
That is the world's only
loop-the-loop bobsled run.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.485
Now we enter famous
rock valley hot Springs.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.320
Wait a minute, hold the phone...

38:55.416 --> 38:57.577
I've just been handed a bulletin.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.786
Kurt wuffner,
the European ski star is reported missing.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.292
He was last seen climbing
treacherous pike's peak

39:03.383 --> 39:06.090
moments ago training for the downhill.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.884
Even as I speak to you,

39:07.971 --> 39:10.257
the ski patrol is mounting
an intensive search.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.260
But they are being hampered by
a sudden blinding snowstorm.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.091
As soon as we get more information,

39:15.186 --> 39:17.928
we will give you an update
on this dramatic development.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.980
But now,
to keen hacksaw at the bobsled run.

39:25.071 --> 39:29.155
Well, the possibility of serious injury
lurks at every bone-crunching turn.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.782
Bernard drulinger, you've risked it all

39:31.870 --> 39:33.826
in this dangerous sport of bobsledding.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.153
What drives these men?

39:36.374 --> 39:39.081
Well, they're all quite bonkers, keen.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.160
Okay.

39:42.297 --> 39:46.165
Tight-lipped discipline makes
this European team successful...

39:46.301 --> 39:50.294
Captained by the distinguished
commander Lance quiller.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.965
Let's pick them up coming into the
extremely dangerous loop-the-loop.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.427
Nice and clean through the loop.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.810
Oh, dear, there's a bad tap...

40:03.109 --> 40:06.101
Hold on, mates... this could be it!

40:07.488 --> 40:10.070
I think I can bring her in.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.984
Whoa! Beautiful landing.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.950
Bernard, I'm sure we've got
some young future bobsledders watching.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.001
How can they avoid this sort of thing?

40:24.172 --> 40:26.379
Take up golf instead, keen.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.998
Spine-tingling bobsled action continues

40:29.093 --> 40:31.379
with Europe's calamari brothers.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.503
We've got a study in contrasts here.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.180
An almost casual approach
by these four brothers,

40:36.309 --> 40:38.971
whose teamwork developed
running the family business.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.308
With commander quiver's hopes dashed,
this team

40:43.399 --> 40:45.105
has a good shot at the gold.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.359
Hah! You're going to
really enjoy watching these boys.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.195
Not only are they
extremely gifted athletes,

40:51.324 --> 40:53.030
they love their sport.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.280
And they're not afraid to show it.

40:57.997 --> 40:58.997
Mama Mia!

40:59.082 --> 41:01.949
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

41:05.088 --> 41:06.703
Nice line through the turn.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.251
Ooops,
a little skid - that's going to cost them.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.253
But their midway time is good.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.921
They're really flying
through this fastest turn.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.182
They do it nicely...
The final straightway...

41:19.268 --> 41:20.929
Clean run!

41:22.981 --> 41:24.892
Let's do it again!

41:24.983 --> 41:27.975
That time will give them the lead!

41:29.737 --> 41:32.353
And looking at it again,
it just proves the old point

41:32.448 --> 41:35.406
that those who are truly great
just seem to enjoy their work

41:35.493 --> 41:37.609
just a little bit more
than the rest of us.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.910
Now, back to Henry...

41:38.997 --> 41:41.989
Nothing new to report as
the search for wuffner continues.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.325
More animal olympic coverage coming up.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.419
This blizzard...

41:58.474 --> 42:00.965
I've got to find shelter.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.222
There's no coming back from this mountain.

42:31.424 --> 42:36.043
Away from it all in another place

42:36.596 --> 42:42.341
different space with
another point of view

42:43.519 --> 42:47.137
alone together with you

42:50.109 --> 42:51.974
love is the ruler

42:52.195 --> 42:54.561
and beauty is queen

42:55.073 --> 42:57.155
is it a dream

42:57.325 --> 43:01.068
from which I'll never rise?

43:01.996 --> 43:05.488
I'll never realize

43:08.002 --> 43:12.416
we're in a world where
the darkness never falls

43:12.632 --> 43:17.171
in a place where all worries disappear

43:17.595 --> 43:21.679
and even if it can't go on forever

43:22.725 --> 43:26.638
we'll make the most of what is here

43:26.979 --> 43:31.598
away from it all in another time

43:31.984 --> 43:37.274
peace of mind,
there's nothin' 1'd rather do

43:38.199 --> 43:42.067
than be alone together with you

43:52.130 --> 43:55.418
Away from it all

43:56.801 --> 43:59.634
away from it all

44:01.347 --> 44:04.510
away from it all

44:05.977 --> 44:08.969
away from it all.

44:19.115 --> 44:20.150
Well, we're back.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.155
The search for ski star Kurt wuffner,

44:22.285 --> 44:25.277
missing, and presumed lost on pike's peak,
continues.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.119
We'll keep you up to date.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.086
If you don't think you're about to withess

44:35.173 --> 44:38.757
a gargantuan' battle between behemoths,
then you are mistaken,

44:38.885 --> 44:43.219
as the eurasian shorthorns take
on the kodiaks from north America.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.888
This game of hockey is one of the fastest

44:45.975 --> 44:47.806
and most dangerous of sports.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.509
Indeed, some have charged

44:49.604 --> 44:53.267
it's no longer a game played in
pursuit of athletic excellence,

44:53.357 --> 44:56.190
but rather as an exercise in destruction.

44:56.819 --> 45:00.277
One of the architects behind
this demolition derby on ice

45:00.406 --> 45:03.489
is the coach of the kodiaks, bear mclane.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.196
Men...

45:06.495 --> 45:09.987
This is the face of the enemy.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.575
He is vicious. He is ruthless!

45:14.337 --> 45:16.999
He will stop at nothing!

45:18.257 --> 45:20.248
Now... you all know the game plan.

45:21.636 --> 45:24.298
Line up for the face-off.
After you take his face off,

45:24.388 --> 45:26.720
kick him in the shins.
Centering pass to eggs...

45:26.807 --> 45:28.422
Eggs over easy. Goddard shoots.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.842
Six spectators injured.
Derek checks the goalie.

45:30.937 --> 45:33.394
He likes what he sees.
He boards the goalie. They fight.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.188
The goalie moves out.
But first, lefluke ices the puck.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.266
He licks the spoon, shoots, score!

45:38.527 --> 45:41.314
Now, let's go get 'em!

45:57.797 --> 45:59.537
It's time for the opening face-off

45:59.674 --> 46:02.086
in this battle of fire and ice.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.508
Face-off to chubbs...

46:08.849 --> 46:10.840
Passes off to the right wing...

46:11.060 --> 46:13.551
North Americans control. A steal!

46:14.105 --> 46:17.438
This hard-checking game
is taking its toll.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.645
Face-off to Derek.

46:20.820 --> 46:22.776
Time out while they clear the ice.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.228
Oh, boy!

46:24.949 --> 46:26.735
The question this reporter asks is

46:26.909 --> 46:31.323
how long can coach mclane afford to
keep this all-star line off the ice?

46:32.164 --> 46:34.655
Oh, no! They got Harry!

46:35.751 --> 46:37.537
I will get them for this!

46:37.712 --> 46:39.748
Those crazy oxens!

46:44.802 --> 46:47.168
Lefluke gets past the
tough shorthorn defense.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.546
Slapshot!

46:50.808 --> 46:53.174
Score as time runs out!

46:53.602 --> 46:56.139
North America takes it
in the closing seconds,

46:56.314 --> 46:58.930
avoiding sudden death overtime.

46:59.317 --> 47:02.024
It's getting darker, coach. Darker...

47:02.611 --> 47:05.944
I think I'm going to that
big penalty box in the sky.

47:06.324 --> 47:10.158
I did it for Harry.
We won, didn't we, coach?

47:12.246 --> 47:15.613
Talk to me, guy. Talk to me!

47:16.125 --> 47:18.036
Hockey, a team sport,

47:18.169 --> 47:21.377
but, behind it,
the selfless personal dedication

47:21.505 --> 47:25.293
and sacrifice of the individuals.

47:26.802 --> 47:29.839
With me, the coaches of the
two leading marathon runners.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.504
Coach mama yo wu-wu...

47:31.682 --> 47:34.640
Can kit mambo keep up with
rené's blistering pace?

47:35.269 --> 47:38.557
René's pace? This is kit mambo's race.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.304
She is setting the pace.

47:40.441 --> 47:44.150
I have this marathon planned,
from beginning to end.

47:45.321 --> 47:46.902
Coach Toulouse la track...

47:46.989 --> 47:48.695
What's your reaction?

47:48.991 --> 47:51.607
I don't have to defend rené fromage.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.408
When this marathon is over,

47:53.537 --> 47:56.449
he will still be the
greatest runner in the world.

47:56.540 --> 48:00.499
Incidentally, I am calling for
blood tests after this race.

48:00.669 --> 48:03.376
I have heard rumors of "catnip".

48:03.672 --> 48:05.628
- How dare youl!
- Oh, yeah?

48:07.051 --> 48:08.131
Get away from me!

48:08.260 --> 48:10.467
And now... to Brenda springer!

48:15.976 --> 48:18.763
Let's take a look at
the swinging west coast life

48:18.896 --> 48:21.353
of Dean Wilson - "zoo on you!"

48:21.941 --> 48:24.148
Hey, I'm high life, man!

48:25.236 --> 48:26.942
The west is the best.

48:27.029 --> 48:29.190
It's all here, for sure!

48:31.534 --> 48:33.525
But you gotta have wheels out here, man.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.577
Wendy really digs my Van,
'cause I got diamond-pleat seats.

48:36.705 --> 48:38.536
And listen to that sound system.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.657
We're both vegetarians.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.754
Me and my board have been through a lot.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.423
And sometimes, after a day of surfing,

48:49.510 --> 48:51.876
I like to relax with the guys.

48:52.513 --> 48:57.177
And other times, I seek to find
myself in the calm beauty of nature.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.099
Okay, we're back at poolside

49:03.190 --> 49:05.306
with former swimming great Mark spritz,

49:05.401 --> 49:07.733
ready for the start
of the 100 meter freestyle.

49:07.820 --> 49:09.560
Mark, we've just seen the favorite.

49:09.655 --> 49:12.021
But what can we expect
from the rest of the field?

49:12.116 --> 49:14.198
Well, Brenda, it's a strong cross-section

49:14.285 --> 49:16.276
of the fastest swimmers
in the aquatic world.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.702
In Lane one,
it's the European art hawkworth.

49:18.998 --> 49:21.364
Look for him to be
riding high on the water.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.701
In Lane two, sergie wedgenikov,
the eurasian.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.002
He's been unflappable
in world competition.

49:27.089 --> 49:30.502
In Lane three,
European John Carlo calamari.

49:30.676 --> 49:31.676
He's always tough.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.718
Earlier this week,
wedgenikov and calamari faced off

49:34.763 --> 49:37.846
during the brutal water Polo
competition won by the Europeans.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.764
But the man they're all here to beat,

49:39.852 --> 49:42.639
perhaps one of the greatest
natural athletes of all time,

49:42.730 --> 49:45.437
Dean Wilson is in Lane four.
The way I see it,

49:45.524 --> 49:47.685
the only thing between Dean and the gold

49:47.818 --> 49:51.982
is the 190 tons of oh-no no-no,
the great Asian champion.

49:52.281 --> 49:55.773
That sets the field for the 100
meter freestyle, down and back.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.358
- Brenda...
- Mark...

49:57.453 --> 49:59.569
How do you think Dean will swim this race?

49:59.705 --> 50:01.286
He's got to take an early lead,

50:01.373 --> 50:04.240
and stay in the unbroken water to win.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.455
It's a good start.
No-no's out to an early lead!

50:16.055 --> 50:18.922
Dean didn't take it out as
fast as I thought he would,

50:18.974 --> 50:20.760
but he's loose, he's swimming well.

50:21.852 --> 50:24.264
He got a good turn, but it wasn't enough!

50:25.940 --> 50:28.272
This bow wave is gonna take him out.

50:31.987 --> 50:34.899
No! He's gonna use it to take him in!

50:35.658 --> 50:36.989
Where is he?

50:39.954 --> 50:41.910
It's Dean, with a new world's record.

50:41.997 --> 50:45.455
No-no takes second,
followed by wedgenikov!

50:45.709 --> 50:47.870
There is that look of gold!

50:48.754 --> 50:50.745
Congratulations on your victory, Dean.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.379
Here it is on the monitor.

50:52.508 --> 50:55.671
Well, man,
this wave had my name written all over it!

50:55.761 --> 50:58.093
So I said, "go for it, man."

50:59.765 --> 51:03.553
So, Dean, you knew you
had it all the way in this one.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.593
For sure!

51:10.776 --> 51:13.233
We're back at poolside with Mark spritz

51:13.320 --> 51:16.187
for one of the more dramatic
and beautiful events,

51:16.407 --> 51:17.897
the 100 meter dive.

51:17.992 --> 51:21.826
Diving from this height requires
great concentration and control,

51:21.912 --> 51:24.904
not to mention strong legs
just to get to the board.

51:24.999 --> 51:27.490
This event requires the
strength of weightlifting

51:27.585 --> 51:28.995
and the grace of gymnastics,

51:29.086 --> 51:32.453
as exemplified by Wilson and
this acapulco cliff-diver,

51:32.590 --> 51:33.830
primo cabaza.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.064
Look at that back-arch in the swan!

52:02.745 --> 52:05.703
Good extension head-to-toe,
and he's reaching for the water.

52:05.789 --> 52:09.623
A little over,
but a beautiful dive from primo cabaza.

52:11.003 --> 52:14.336
And the judges thought so, too.
Look at those marks.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.084
They're gonna be tough to beat!

52:16.175 --> 52:18.461
But this crowd expects perfection,

52:18.594 --> 52:21.006
and there's the man that
can give it to them.

52:21.055 --> 52:23.797
It's been said before,
but it bears repeating.

52:23.932 --> 52:27.015
When this boy dives,
he goes off into his own world.

52:42.951 --> 52:45.988
Under the water where
the seaweed grows

52:46.080 --> 52:48.992
there is a world of fascination

52:52.002 --> 52:55.039
beneath the waves is
where the coral glows

52:55.130 --> 52:58.543
there is a world of jubilation

53:01.011 --> 53:04.174
below the surface in another world

53:04.848 --> 53:07.555
the fishes tell another story

53:10.187 --> 53:13.805
the wind don't whistle
and the rain don't fall

53:13.982 --> 53:17.816
the place is full of morning glory

53:18.987 --> 53:22.980
ooh, gotta be there, ooh,
'cause it's me there

53:26.203 --> 53:30.492
ooh, gotta be there,
ooh, and I'm free there

53:30.624 --> 53:33.991
won't you join me under the water

53:45.097 --> 53:48.715
You get a feelin'
like you're upside down

53:48.976 --> 53:51.968
it's like you're livin' in a mirror

53:54.606 --> 53:57.973
and so like Alice in the looking glass

53:58.152 --> 54:01.770
what is small and what is bigger

54:02.740 --> 54:04.981
we're goin' down, down, down

54:05.075 --> 54:06.690
down in the water

54:06.869 --> 54:08.734
goin' down, down, down

54:08.871 --> 54:10.611
doin' what an otter oughta

54:10.748 --> 54:12.204
goin' down, down, down

54:12.833 --> 54:13.993
down in the water

54:14.084 --> 54:17.747
goin' down, down, down, down, down

54:17.963 --> 54:19.828
goin' down, down, down

54:20.007 --> 54:21.247
down in the water

54:21.633 --> 54:23.169
goin' down, down, down

54:23.302 --> 54:25.042
doin' what an otter oughta

54:25.179 --> 54:26.965
goin' down, down, down

54:27.347 --> 54:28.962
down in the water

54:31.769 --> 54:32.849
going down...

54:32.978 --> 54:34.184
And he nailed it!

54:34.313 --> 54:36.975
A perfect entry, a perfect dive!

54:37.107 --> 54:38.563
A super dive!

54:38.734 --> 54:40.645
I don't think anyone's gonna top that.

54:40.778 --> 54:43.861
The Dean Wilson story, a natural athlete

54:43.989 --> 54:46.947
who's made the most of
his god-given talent.

54:51.997 --> 54:54.204
This is the first animal Olympics.

54:54.333 --> 54:58.918
But the history of animal athletics
goes back thousands of years.

54:59.004 --> 55:01.996
Let's have a look at what
remains from those days here,

55:02.090 --> 55:03.330
at the animal archives.

55:03.717 --> 55:06.834
The early discus throwing form
was really quite primitive.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.803
Today's young athletes
really get a sense of history

55:09.932 --> 55:11.138
viewing these exhibits.

55:11.225 --> 55:14.342
This reminds me of the old joke:
"How much does a grecian urn?"

55:14.436 --> 55:16.051
But you've probably heard it.

55:16.230 --> 55:17.970
This piece of pottery is important,

55:18.065 --> 55:21.148
as it shows the earliest
evidence of animal athletics.

55:21.276 --> 55:24.109
Paleontologists believe
this skeleton represents

55:24.238 --> 55:28.026
the earliest known example of
an animal weight-lifting.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.944
This frozen mammoth runner,

55:30.035 --> 55:31.946
believed to be one million years old,

55:32.037 --> 55:34.995
was found recently in the
cradle of animal civilization.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.324
And here, if I may borrow
an old show biz expression,

55:38.418 --> 55:39.999
"is a really big shoe,"

55:40.420 --> 55:44.914
part of this exhibit of athletic
footwear through the centuries.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.008
Stone age,

55:46.093 --> 55:47.093
iron age,

55:47.261 --> 55:48.296
dark ages,

55:48.428 --> 55:49.428
baroque age,

55:49.638 --> 55:50.673
industrial age,

55:50.889 --> 55:52.129
and space age...

55:52.391 --> 55:55.975
These are the types of shoes
worn by our marathoners.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.597
As we go into the downhill
competition without Kurt wuffner,

56:01.733 --> 56:04.816
the world can only ponder the
fate of this great athlete.

56:10.993 --> 56:13.905
Well, of course, the big story here is

56:13.996 --> 56:16.282
the disappearance of Kurt wuffner.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.329
Which puts this boar, marcelle purceau,

56:18.709 --> 56:21.997
in an excellent position to win
the premiere event of these games,

56:22.212 --> 56:23.793
the downhill!

56:24.006 --> 56:25.997
This crash and burn just last summer

56:26.091 --> 56:30.004
almost saw the end of the brilliant
skiing career of marcelle purceau.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.293
He was pronounced dead!

56:31.388 --> 56:33.970
But through the intensive
efforts of a dedicated team

56:34.057 --> 56:37.549
of scientists and doctors,
he was put back together

56:37.644 --> 56:40.681
designed with one thing in mind: Speed!

57:08.926 --> 57:12.214
We're "live" now.
Let's see if this effort pays off!

57:15.974 --> 57:19.341
He missed that free jump
coming off of that mogul.

57:19.478 --> 57:20.888
He's lost it.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.890
This looks bad...

57:22.981 --> 57:24.437
A terrible spill...

57:27.986 --> 57:31.023
He's gonna feel this in the morning!

57:38.205 --> 57:40.992
Let's check out the damage on the replay.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.448
He told me earlier

57:42.584 --> 57:45.917
he felt really good about this race.

57:46.004 --> 57:48.916
Maybe they can use him for spare parts.

57:49.007 --> 57:50.963
Well, that about wraps it up here.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.461
An anti-climactic finish,

57:52.552 --> 57:56.716
the winner with a mediocre time
of 1:58:02, the Scandinavian...

57:56.890 --> 57:58.096
Wait a minute, bjorn...

57:58.266 --> 58:00.427
Who's that in the starting gate?

58:00.978 --> 58:02.184
It's Kurt wuffner!

58:03.230 --> 58:04.970
And here he comes!

58:05.190 --> 58:08.978
Let's see if his battle with the
elements has broken his spirits!

58:14.157 --> 58:16.864
He's really pouring it on!

58:16.994 --> 58:18.530
He seems to have a new spirit

58:18.912 --> 58:23.155
infused with his abilities
we've never seen before.

58:33.301 --> 58:36.964
He's got to hold his speed
for this final straightaway.

58:37.055 --> 58:41.970
Look at that time!
The crowd's jumping up and down.

58:44.271 --> 58:47.559
Let's look again at this
strong finish of Kurt wuffner,

58:47.691 --> 58:50.182
who almost missed this race!

58:52.863 --> 58:56.321
Well, you see a confident
wuffner holding nothing back,

58:56.408 --> 58:58.148
really sailing,

58:58.285 --> 59:01.994
keeping a tight tuck to the finish.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.990
Kurt,
can you come over here and talk with us?

59:06.251 --> 59:10.164
We saw a new Kurt wuffner this afternoon.
Where were you?

59:10.297 --> 59:11.297
I'm not sure really.

59:11.548 --> 59:14.255
I left a strange,
wonderful mountain paradise

59:18.972 --> 59:23.056
I know... I'll never stop
trying until I find dogri-la!

59:24.269 --> 59:26.555
Barbra warblers is on
the marathon course,

59:26.688 --> 59:29.395
with all the latest on this crucial event!

59:31.902 --> 59:35.645
Well, one of these runners has to make
a move here at the tree-quarter Mark.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.980
Physically, they seem to be
perfectly matched.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.157
Emotionally... it's anybody's guess.

59:40.285 --> 59:43.118
They speak of the
wall of physical exhaustion,

59:43.246 --> 59:47.535
but it is papier maché compared to
the barrier that keeps me from kit.

59:47.667 --> 59:51.000
It's the only way, my love.
Soon, we'll be together.

59:52.714 --> 59:56.252
I'll run forever if we can run together!

59:56.384 --> 59:59.091
I can never run again without you.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.766
From neck and neck,
they've gone to hand-in-hand.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.106
This could turn the whole
animal Olympics upside down!

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.358
Excuse me, Barbra,
but looking at the scoreboard here

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.030
the implications are worldwide.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:24.159
Is this someone's
twisted idea of strategy?

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.998
Is this international sabotage?

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:34.244
Or is it just fooling around?

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:41.293
Regardless, as rumors begin to circulate,

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:44.471
we're getting reports of
turmoil at paw print stadium

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:48.304
and around the world.
We'll keep you up to date.

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:59.148
With me, one of the great fighters
of this or any other time,

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.445
Joey gongolong.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:04.195
Champ, shortly you'll be facing the
toughest challenge of your long,

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.785
and I might add,
controversial fighting career,

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.205
the eurasian janos brushteckel.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.991
Champ, take a look at the monitor,
and feel free,

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.327
as I'm sure you do, to comment.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:18.247
That face is almost
as ugly as yours, rugs.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.632
He's too ugly to be champ.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.504
True enough.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:25.421
But I've seen that vicious
left hook of his, and, champ,

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.429
you better stop fooling around

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.967
and take this challenger seriously.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.052
What are you talking about,
taking it seriously?

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:34.729
I did everything I could to
get ready for this fight.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.224
Up and down on the hardwood floors,

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.476
didn't eat no meat,
it lays in your stomach

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:41.653
and makes you fat and lazy and heavy.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.737
Every time in my corner you on my back.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.859
I trained hard for this busmackle,
busbackle, bustackle...

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:50.445
I can't even pronounce his name.
That's why I'm gonna whip him so bad,

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.452
he's gonna look like his last name sounds.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.998
I'm the greatest animal
champion of all time!

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.252
Thank you, champ.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:01.005
Round one of this gold
medal bout coming up,

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:04.004
after this fast-breaking basketball story.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.838
The great rivalry
between the two super continents

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:10.181
is personified by these two athletes...

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:14.098
Dr. Abdul Jones, captain
of the undefeated north American team;

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.940
and pavel shotski,
center for the top contending eurasians.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:20.563
Okay, tie score.
We're down to the last few seconds.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.316
Shotski moves the ball and his
considerable bulk down court.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.862
Stolen by Meadow fly Larkin.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.867
Behind the back to Jackson...

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.039
Over to the doctor... it's one on one.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.542
A fake! He's gonna slam it.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.252
Two points! That's the game!

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.713
The north Americans take it!

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.168
Another gold medal for
the north Americans!

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.920
Checking on the marathon,
it's incomprehensible.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.256
Kit and rené are still picking up the pace

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.726
as they approach the home stretch,
hand in hand.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.891
The face tells the story.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.015
Janos brushteckel has
suffered a crushing defeat

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:03.518
at the hands of an
unrelenting Joey gongolong.

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:05.566
Janos, this won't be easy,

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.315
but I urge you to take
a look at this replay

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.700
and learn from your mistakes.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.870
You left your midsection wide open here,
janos.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:15.958
There's the snap.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.875
He's pushing upright for the extra point.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.004
And then he puts you away for good.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.628
Janos, you lost miserably.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.174
You let down your coach.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.135
You let down your country.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.807
You let down your mother.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:36.927
You're a bum steer.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.686
But, most importantly,

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.189
you let down yourself.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.975
And now you can let me down.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.195
There are two great
runners in first place,

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.990
but only one gold medal.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.113
Yeah, and it belongs to rené.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.452
It's kit's. I'll take that.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.950
Give me that! Oh! Oooh.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.792
Give me that thing. Give me that!

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:03.662
- Take that...
- Gimme, gimme that!

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.673
When you see the precision teamwork,

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.672
the great individual effort,
and the fast, exciting pace,

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.630
well, you'll understand why
volleyball is quickly becoming

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.885
one of the most popular
sports in the world!

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.103
Hello again, everybody! I'm keen hacksaw.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.773
We got a surf 'n turf grudge match here,

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:26.644
as the Asian stuffers
take on the European wings

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.611
in a fight for a gold medal.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.440
This flock is known for their
flashy but smooth offense.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.196
Six hens working as one giant chicken!

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.751
Team captain Mandy egger serves.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.374
The pass...

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.925
The spike... good recovery!

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.595
Side out lobsters.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.266
We got a great contrast in style here

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:08.477
between the extroverted play of these hens

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.734
and the hard-nosed methodical
style of this team of crustaceans.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.532
Serving for the stuffers, ezo donoroto.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.950
Chicken returns...

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:25.994
Oh, the opening game jitters are
gone now as both teams rally.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:29.047
The wings' crossing pattern
is holding these lobsters yet.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.134
Quick set!

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.834
Strong spike!

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.054
She got it.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:43.724
Looks like things are getting
serious between kit and rené.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.931
Bruce, what do you think it all means?

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:54.239
Thank you, Bruce.
Too bad we don't know what that means.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.867
Dean, what about these crazy kids?

01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:01.204
Hey, man, they're going all the way!

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.865
Let's go to melé and Brenda springer

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.326
with another struggle between heavyweights

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.999
from weightlifting hippodrome.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:16.298
The beautiful people have
gathered here this evening

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:19.881
for the glamour and allure of
international weightlifting.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:21.803
Before the night is through,

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.811
the first Mr. heavyweight will be crowned.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.313
I know you are so very anxious,

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:29.774
so let's meet our two beautiful finalists,
yes?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:35.526
Here is Europe's powerhouse,
Wilhelm cvet.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.444
Wilhelm keeps busy in the off-season

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.742
designing and making his own clothes.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:43.489
And the favorite, Ivan disventsky.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.165
Ivan and his wife,
Ludmilla steponyatova,

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.833
both work in the circus.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.294
In the off season, they grow big!

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.122
In addition to the gold medal,

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.798
our winner will receive dinner for two

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:55.546
at the posh "top of the silo" restaurant,

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.757
a gift certificate from the
fabulous beagle catalogue,

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.527
plus an all-expenses-paid vacation for two

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.472
at lion safari country...

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.767
And two tickets to every home game
of the bruins, cardinals, orioles,

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.970
lions, tigers, broncos, and dolphins!

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.680
Our finalists are ready.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.894
Each of our contestants will attempt

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.475
a clean and press of this...

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.694
Oh, excuse me, I mean a clean and jerk,

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.904
a clean and press is only for the laundry.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.152
Wilhelm told me
earlier in the dressing room

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:22.907
that the privilege of competing in
this competition was meaningless,

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.988
and that all he wanted to do was win!

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.210
Oh, too bad!

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:40.382
May we have our next contestant, please?

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.972
Oh, the competitors love Ivan.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:46.468
Earlier, he was voted "Mr. conviviality".

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:56.148
We've got "Mr. heavyweight".

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.984
And here,
to crown the first Mr. heavyweight winner

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:03.944
at the animal Olympics,
is the reigning champion Bert sparks.

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.990
There he is, the new "Mr. heavyweight",

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.995
Ivan disventsky.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.750
This is Brenda springer,
live from weightlifting hippodrome.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:24.721
Count Maurice boar-deaux,
cunning, cruel and dangerous...

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:32.063
Duke chardas, scrawny,
sleight, and sacrificial...

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.765
He's the only one left.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.692
Boar-deaux has knocked off everybody else.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.529
En garde, you little fool.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.872
Ha-ha-ha! You stupid rodent!

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:58.417
No one beats me!

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.252
The pompous hog takes home the gold!

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.511
Now, back to z-0-o and hen...

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:05.759
Stop!

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.059
Wait a minute!

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.559
This time you go too far, boar-deaux!

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.689
Eh, it's the contessa.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.752
You'll never dance again.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.872
You've never danced before!

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:58.982
Well, darling

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.946
shall we make it a tooth for a tooth,
or an eye for an eye?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.001
Hey! Contessa!

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.967
The count thought he'd
take home the gold medal.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.766
But the swirling steel
wielded by a vengeful contessa

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.856
is too much for a blimp like boar-deaux.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.861
And the gold medal goes to eurasia.

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:49.154
Now, to Henry hummel.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.990
From the beginning,
z-0-0 has provided you

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.992
with an intimate look at the marathon.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.078
We knew it would be the pivotal event,

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:59.582
and now, with the continents
locked into a five-way tie,

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.628
kit and rené, hand in hand,

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:04.423
hold the athletic destiny of the world.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.972
With you I can run forever

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:23.151
with you I can run forever, mm-hmm

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:27.151
'cause you gotta be my inspiration

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.984
side by side through every nation, mm-hmm

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:35.914
we ride the world just
like a rollercoaster

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.993
as we take each road and we
take each turn, you bowl me over

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:43.295
'cause you gotta be my inspiration

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:47.125
together we can run forever, mm-hmm

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:51.174
through all the seasons,
we'll keep goin' on

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:55.141
through the wind and
rain and the morning dew

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:59.350
it doesn't matter, baby, where we are

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.648
with you I can run forever

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:07.149
with you I can run forever

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.857
we see the bright lights of the city

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.861
the colors change they
rearrange themselves

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:15.991
in different patterns

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.994
but it's too crowded in the city

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:22.035
and so we leave it all behind

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:25.334
go on to other places

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:51.067
With you I can run forever

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:55.864
with you I can run forever, mm-hmm

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.155
there's nothing we can't win together

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.324
with you I can run forever, mm-hmm...

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.328
I can't believe these great athletes

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:09.837
who trained years for this
would sacrifice it all for love.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.880
This could start a war.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.129
They're crossing the finish line together!

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:17.886
René! Kit! Stop! Come back!

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:20.389
The world demands an explanation!

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:21.973
Coach mama yo wu-wu...

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.350
Is there an explanation
for kit's behavior?

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.895
I had it all planned.
Kip mambo track shoes,

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.227
kit mambo dolls, kip mambo vitamins...

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:31.945
A lifetime of training,
and she throws it all away.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.068
For what?

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:35.904
What about rené, coach?

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.237
For rené to steal the heart
of a naive young thing, yes.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.240
For rené to fall for a
pair of pretty legs, yes.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:45.459
But for rené to give up the gold for love?
No!

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.790
Never!

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.218
That marathon ends the competition

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.087
here on animal olympic island.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.805
Keen hacksaw has this wrap-up...

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:01.138
Well, they all fought for the gold,

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.099
but only the great ones take it home.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.315
We saw Tatiana tushenko's
perfect performance.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:16.737
We saw great sportsmanship
personified by bolt Jenkins.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.568
But, of course, the big story,

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.988
the unprecedented romantic encounter

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.994
between first-place winner kit mambo

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:26.827
and first-place winner rené fromage.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.289
Back to you, Henry...

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:30.913
You know, bringing you these games

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.999
required the precision teamwork

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:36.962
of herds of dedicated animals
working behind the scenes.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.473
Our isolated camera animal, Saul Terry.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:41.765
Good job, Saul.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:45.974
Another of our roving camera animals,
Jim panazi.

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.727
In the video truck, Randy gravitelli.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:51.350
Our statistician, Manny fingers.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:54.979
Our sound rabbit,
Woody hutchinson on the big ears.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.947
Good reproduction, Woody.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.908
Our tape editor, Gary mathers.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.076
Tight, Gary.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.491
Countless producers and technicians

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:07.993
and a tireless executive producer,
Don osterizer.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.832
I can't believe it's all over.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.957
There's gonna be a celebration...

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.508
For everyone on the z-o-o team,

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:20.221
I'm Henry hummel. Goodbye and good luck

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:23.508
to all you future gold medal winners.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.473
It was tiring, it was testing

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.263
it was almost never ending

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:34.402
but we all pulled through
and won the accolades

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:42.030
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:48.457
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:54.502
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

01:15:56.010 --> 01:16:00.344
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:09.975
We've made some friends along the way

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:17.479
we've made some friends and
we made the people happy

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.981
when we came in number one

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.947
and so we've reached the finish

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:27.622
all the races we have won

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.545
it's been a long and lonely battle

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:37.373
and we lost some along the way

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:42.587
but the time has come to
hold our heads up high

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:46.594
we had to beat 'em and defeat 'em

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.677
but we never had to cheat 'em

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:54.982
we're the champions
who've made it all the way

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:02.406
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:08.530
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.664
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:21.252
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:30.434
We've made some friends along the way

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:37.772
we've made some friends and
we made the people happy

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.611
when we came in number one

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:44.064
and so we've reached the finish

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:47.739
all the races we have won

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:54.997
now that we've made it,
we've made it to the top

01:17:56.255 --> 01:18:01.340
now that we've made it,
we ain't never gonna stop
