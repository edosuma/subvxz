WEBVTT

00:02.094 --> 00:04.721
Her name is Jodie Papadakis
and she's my idol.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.593
I've been following her career,
like, forever.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.566
I can't believe I finally get to meet her.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.398
When I found out that she was running
the YETI program, I screamed.

00:17.442 --> 00:19.535
I should probably buy
Mrs. Bowen a gift.

00:19.578 --> 00:22.046
Okay, less talking, more taping.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.207
I can't believe I set this party for Friday!

00:24.249 --> 00:26.240
How am I supposed to get all of this
done in three days?

00:26.284 --> 00:29.618
That's what your family is for.
Don't worry, we'll get it done.

00:29.656 --> 00:32.090
Did I tell you that she started out
as a junior assistant

00:32.125 --> 00:33.683
<i>at The New York Observer?</i>

00:33.726 --> 00:36.796
Five years, she became
the Editor-in-Chief. She's a genius.

00:36.796 --> 00:39.162
Wow, and you chose us over her?

00:39.198 --> 00:41.257
No, tonight's just a mixer.
I get to see her tomorrow.

00:41.334 --> 00:44.667
Oh, Betty, what do you think
if for the re-opening,

00:44.704 --> 00:48.401
I hire someone to do music
or magic or something?

00:48.441 --> 00:49.874
Mom. No magic.

00:49.909 --> 00:52.945
I try so hard to get
the bridge-and-tunnel out of this family.

00:52.945 --> 00:55.470
Would it be too weird to ask her
to be my mentor right away?

00:55.515 --> 00:57.779
Betty, your sister
just asked you a question.

00:57.817 --> 00:58.841
Yeah, hello?

00:58.885 --> 01:01.547
Right, yes.
Do you know what else would be fun?

01:01.587 --> 01:02.952
Gift bags!

01:03.589 --> 01:05.580
I can't afford gift bags.

01:05.625 --> 01:10.585
I spent all my money on this
beautiful sign and this new merch.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.258
That's short for merchandise.

01:13.332 --> 01:15.766
Hilda! It won't cost you a thing.

01:15.802 --> 01:19.239
<i>Mode gets samples all the time.
I can just bring some home tomorrow.</i>

01:19.273 --> 01:20.672
Hey, what do you think?

01:21.809 --> 01:23.640
"Hilda's Beautilities Plus!"

01:23.677 --> 01:27.169
Oh, my God, this is so exciting!

01:27.214 --> 01:30.445
This party is gonna be like
my very own Broadway opening!

01:30.484 --> 01:33.544
<i>Yes, it's like Spring Awakening,
Avenue Q and South Pacific</i>

01:33.587 --> 01:35.214
all rolled into one.

01:35.255 --> 01:36.950
Grandpa, nice!

01:37.858 --> 01:39.553
Hey, I keep up.

01:40.694 --> 01:43.219
Hey,
shouldn't that face outward?

01:45.065 --> 01:46.555
I wasn't done.

01:53.774 --> 01:57.141
<i>There is no other way to spin it.
Elle kicked our butts last month.</i>

01:57.177 --> 01:59.907
Was it classy to show Sarah Silverman
on the toilet?

01:59.947 --> 02:02.677
No. But their numbers were way up,
and a win is a win.

02:02.716 --> 02:05.184
<i>So trashy. That never would've
happened at Elle on my watch.</i>

02:05.219 --> 02:06.277
Weren't you an intern?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.412
- Shut up.
- Guys.

02:07.454 --> 02:10.982
Anyway, we are not gonna lose again.

02:11.025 --> 02:13.926
If we do, one of you dies.

02:13.962 --> 02:17.090
I have something big planned for April.
I can't talk about it just yet.

02:17.165 --> 02:20.066
Treat everything we discuss in here
as proprietary.

02:20.101 --> 02:22.399
<i>Those cows at Elle would love to know
what we're up to.</i>

02:22.437 --> 02:25.406
On the flip side, if any of you hear
anything about them,

02:25.440 --> 02:27.931
there's a very nice bottle of wine in it
for you.

02:28.009 --> 02:31.809
And maybe you'll live to see
another day. Now get back to work.

02:34.282 --> 02:38.309
I love the whole good cop-bad cop
thing you two have going.

02:38.353 --> 02:41.845
It's not really a thing.
It's more like I'm nice, she's not.

02:41.890 --> 02:44.757
Can I help it if my balls are bigger
than his?

02:44.793 --> 02:46.658
God, I love this woman.

02:47.862 --> 02:49.261
Yeah.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.925
Will I see you at my party on Friday?
I bumped Graydon Carter for you.

02:53.001 --> 02:55.401
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.199
Molly has a school pageant
that night,

02:57.238 --> 02:59.639
but I plan on talking her out of it.

03:00.810 --> 03:03.404
- Molly's coming?
- Is that all right?

03:04.146 --> 03:06.706
Of course! She's your fiancÃ©e.

03:06.749 --> 03:10.446
I guess I'll just have to bump
Anna Wintour off the guest list.

03:10.486 --> 03:11.976
But, you know, serves her right.

03:12.021 --> 03:14.956
I think she stole a pair of sunglasses
from me last year.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.185
Good. I'm looking forward to it.

03:20.663 --> 03:22.324
This is the recently unearthed

03:22.398 --> 03:24.764
Halston original from the
Fireworks collection.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.268
Wow, that is incredible.

03:27.303 --> 03:30.704
I found this private collector
who's gonna loan it to us for one shoot.

03:30.739 --> 03:34.231
Keira Knightley will do our cover
if she can wear this dress.

03:34.276 --> 03:36.141
- Shut up!
- I mean, on that cover alone

03:36.178 --> 03:38.339
we got 30 more pages of ad buys.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.507
This could really be
a big game-changer for us.

03:40.549 --> 03:43.586
<i>Suck on that, Elle!
Go Daniel, go Daniel.</i>

03:43.586 --> 03:44.848
We talked about that.

03:44.887 --> 03:47.447
All right,
I need you to arrange to pick this up

03:47.489 --> 03:49.252
from the collector's loft tomorrow.

03:49.292 --> 03:53.319
Here's the info.
Please, Betty, keep it hush-hush.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.354
I feel like an international spy.

03:55.432 --> 03:58.629
Except real spies
don't announce they're spies.

04:00.570 --> 04:03.698
Daniel, would you mind
stepping into my office?

04:03.740 --> 04:06.072
I'd like to show you something.

04:07.611 --> 04:10.239
I have some friends here in security.

04:12.983 --> 04:16.111
I didn't realize you and Molly
were so close.

04:17.053 --> 04:18.543
You're awful.

04:19.422 --> 04:22.220
Perhaps in the past, but not this time.

04:25.495 --> 04:28.259
Look, this is the only copy. It's yours.

04:29.466 --> 04:31.559
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

04:32.335 --> 04:34.803
This is a personal matter.

04:35.405 --> 04:39.205
I understand. She's engaged
to your friend, our... Our colleague.

04:39.242 --> 04:42.974
Look, I'm sure you probably
don't want to talk to me about this,

04:43.014 --> 04:45.915
but some things are worth the risk.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.475
We both know how hard it is
to find love.

04:48.519 --> 04:50.578
It's not love.

04:52.423 --> 04:55.324
Look, I don't know what it is,
or how she feels.

04:55.359 --> 04:57.725
You know how you feel.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.957
And it looks like Molly might be
on the same page.

04:59.997 --> 05:03.626
Don't you think you owe it to yourself
to see whether there's anything there?

05:07.071 --> 05:11.098
You gave him the DVD? What the hell
is going on with you, woman?

05:11.175 --> 05:13.302
And don't say,
"Not everything's a scheme, Marc,"

05:13.344 --> 05:14.538
because I will slap you.

05:14.578 --> 05:16.409
Not everything is a scheme, Marc.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.677
Okay, I think we both know
that I'm not going to slap you.

05:18.716 --> 05:20.581
Sometimes honesty works, too.

05:20.618 --> 05:23.917
Oh, I get it. So honesty's the scheme.
The old honesty scheme.

05:23.955 --> 05:25.149
Yeah! That's a classic.

05:25.189 --> 05:28.090
No, no. This is one of those rare times
where what Daniel wants

05:28.159 --> 05:29.387
and what I want intersect.

05:29.427 --> 05:32.363
Now, if Daniel and Molly
end up together,

05:32.397 --> 05:33.659
where does that leave Connor?

05:34.800 --> 05:37.826
Heartbroken, and then you'll be there
to pick up the pieces.

05:37.903 --> 05:39.598
You know me. I'm very nurturing.

05:39.671 --> 05:44.108
Yeah.
Very. Very nurturing.

05:44.910 --> 05:49.472
Christina, "Betty Suarez.
Young Editor in Training. "

05:50.182 --> 05:51.410
This is so sweet!

05:51.450 --> 05:55.250
I wanted you to have
something special for your first day.

05:55.287 --> 05:57.278
Just don't you forget about me
when you're a big star

05:57.322 --> 05:59.950
and I'm still stuck here
in my tailor's dungeon.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.018
All right, I know
when you're feeling sorry for yourself.

06:03.061 --> 06:06.121
Well, I've been re-lining
Wilhelmina's dress

06:06.164 --> 06:08.257
for her super-elite cocktail party,

06:08.333 --> 06:10.893
even though the old one
was perfectly good.

06:10.969 --> 06:13.870
And all this extra bending down
is making me feel dizzy

06:13.905 --> 06:16.135
because I'm carrying her little rodent,

06:16.174 --> 06:20.201
which seems to be kicking me
in the gut every five seconds today.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.111
And the Internet's gone down.

06:25.985 --> 06:30.786
Sorry. It's all the hormones. Just...

06:30.823 --> 06:33.621
Okay, all right, okay.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.127
Hey, hey, you know
what would cheer you up?

06:36.162 --> 06:38.153
- What, what, what?
- Come to Hilda's!

06:38.197 --> 06:41.963
She's having this huge re-opening
of her salon. It'll be fun.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.730
Yeah, that does sound like fun.

06:43.803 --> 06:47.671
I like your sister.
She says what's on her mind, eh?

06:47.707 --> 06:49.265
And she drinks.

06:50.676 --> 06:51.904
I used to drink.

06:53.012 --> 06:56.106
Christina, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

06:56.149 --> 06:59.185
No, I'm fine. I do this all day long.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.621
Now, go, go!

07:02.655 --> 07:05.283
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive! Go, go!

07:05.324 --> 07:07.588
Okay, but you'll call me
if you need anything.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.858
Yes! Now go on, hurry up.
I know you're really excited about this.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.458
I am. I am so excited.

07:14.268 --> 07:17.328
Christina, this could be the beginning
of the rest of my life.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.164
Welcome to the funeral.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.336
The magazine business is dying.
Dying.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.314
Does that frighten you? It should.
It scares the hell out of me.

07:29.349 --> 07:33.581
So what do you do? Do you give up?

07:34.388 --> 07:36.549
Or do you toughen up?

07:36.590 --> 07:42.324
When I arrived in New York
with my curly hair and this voice,

07:42.362 --> 07:46.856
do you think anyone
took me seriously? No.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.134
They mocked me.
So from then on, I made...

07:50.204 --> 07:52.866
- I love her.
- Did you eat onions for lunch?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.135
Do I hear talking?

07:55.175 --> 07:58.576
How can that possibly be? I'm talking.

07:59.413 --> 08:02.713
Good, thank you. Now, let's get started.

08:02.750 --> 08:07.755
Marc St. James, raise your hand.

08:07.755 --> 08:11.350
Tell me the name and magazine
of five of the people in this room, go.

08:12.694 --> 08:15.720
<i>Heather Jackson, Gourmet.
Tom Buckley, Sports Illustrated.</i>

08:15.763 --> 08:20.291
<i>Eric West, Harper's. Evie Foster, Out.</i>

08:20.335 --> 08:23.600
<i>And Rita Thompson, Rolling Stone.</i>

08:24.172 --> 08:27.505
- Excellent. Betty Suarez.
- Yes?

08:27.542 --> 08:29.874
Five people. Name and magazine.

08:30.345 --> 08:31.334
Um...

08:32.614 --> 08:35.707
Uh... Uh... Uh...

08:37.652 --> 08:40.177
<i>Well, I know Marc.
He works with me at Mode. Hi, Marc.</i>

08:40.221 --> 08:42.883
- Who are you?
- He's just kidding.

08:42.924 --> 08:45.324
Didn't you meet anyone at the mixer?

08:45.360 --> 08:48.693
I wasn't at the mixer.
I had a family obligation.

08:48.730 --> 08:51.766
And since it was just casual,
I skipped it.

08:51.766 --> 08:53.962
Who else missed the event last night?

08:54.003 --> 08:58.167
Anyone else have a family obligation,
a sick hamster?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.208
No? Good.

09:01.076 --> 09:05.672
Because last night wasn't casual.
Last night was an opportunity

09:05.714 --> 09:08.979
for you to learn something
about your future colleagues.

09:09.018 --> 09:13.284
But I guess that wasn't important
to Miss Suarez.

09:13.322 --> 09:15.916
It is. It's very important to me.

09:15.958 --> 09:17.892
- Can I change seats?
- No.

09:17.927 --> 09:21.658
First assignment, contacts.
By this time next week,

09:21.697 --> 09:25.292
I want everyone in here
to have 40 new ones.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.359
And family doesn't count.

09:28.370 --> 09:32.534
You have to make a lot of
tough choices in this business.

09:33.375 --> 09:38.039
If you can't do that,
then don't plan on coming back.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:00.270 --> 10:01.794
Hold the lift!

10:02.906 --> 10:04.396
Thanks, Betty.

10:08.044 --> 10:09.705
You're doing YETI.

10:09.746 --> 10:10.872
Huh?

10:10.914 --> 10:11.972
Yeah.

10:12.015 --> 10:15.712
My friend Jodie's running that
this year. She's really terrific.

10:15.752 --> 10:18.550
Yeah, yeah, she's great.

10:18.588 --> 10:20.988
She can be pretty tough, though.

10:21.024 --> 10:22.548
Yeah, well...

10:24.294 --> 10:28.526
She was a little unfair to me yesterday,
'cause, you know,

10:28.565 --> 10:32.433
I showed up to class completely
prepared, and then she called me out

10:32.469 --> 10:35.064
'cause I didn't go
to some silly networking thing.

10:35.139 --> 10:37.607
Well, networking is one
of those annoying things.

10:37.675 --> 10:41.907
But if you're serious about your career,
it's something you have to do.

10:41.946 --> 10:45.780
Well, I had a family thing, you know.
I couldn't disappoint them.

10:45.816 --> 10:49.912
I cannot tell you how many things
I've had to miss because of my job.

10:49.954 --> 10:51.751
You just ask Molly.

10:51.789 --> 10:54.349
Yeah, well, it might not matter anyway.

10:54.392 --> 10:58.385
She told me that if I can't get
40 new contacts by next class,

10:58.429 --> 11:00.124
not to come back.

11:00.164 --> 11:03.031
All right, Betty, you do what I did
when I was your age.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.934
You find somebody who's really good
at the superficial stuff,

11:05.970 --> 11:07.995
and you do what they do.

11:13.711 --> 11:15.906
My answer is "no. "

11:15.946 --> 11:18.005
Marc, come on, please.
I'm so desperate.

11:18.049 --> 11:20.142
Okay, give me one good reason
why I should do this.

11:20.184 --> 11:22.675
Well, maybe
because if I hadn't stepped aside,

11:22.720 --> 11:24.313
you wouldn't have gotten into YETI
to begin with?

11:24.356 --> 11:27.553
You're gonna bring up
that old chestnut again?

11:27.592 --> 11:31.255
Fine. But you do not get
to play this card again. Okay?

11:31.296 --> 11:33.890
Meet me and Amanda after work.
We'll take you to Swill.

11:33.932 --> 11:36.162
Everyone you need to meet
will be there.

11:36.201 --> 11:37.395
Great.

11:37.436 --> 11:40.769
Wait, no, Marc, I can't do that.
I promised my sister I'd help...

11:40.806 --> 11:43.832
Don't care.
You got me tonight, or not at all.

11:48.914 --> 11:52.042
Hilda, hi. Look, I'm so sorry,

11:52.084 --> 11:55.178
but I'm not gonna be able
to help out tonight.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.211
Betty, we were supposed
to do these gift bags together.

11:57.255 --> 11:59.985
I know, and we still are, just tomorrow.

12:00.025 --> 12:03.961
See, if I don't do this YETI thing
tonight, they're gonna kick me out.

12:03.995 --> 12:08.432
Fine. I get it. We'll do it tomorrow. Bye.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.900
Bye.

12:09.935 --> 12:14.099
Sweetie, if Betty had a choice,
you know she'd be here.

12:15.308 --> 12:16.969
- Yeah.
- Come on, we got work to do.

12:17.043 --> 12:18.408
All right.

12:20.747 --> 12:22.112
Thank you.

12:23.616 --> 12:24.742
- Excuse me a second.
- Okay.

12:24.784 --> 12:26.251
- Molly!
- Daniel!

12:26.319 --> 12:27.877
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:30.256 --> 12:33.191
- So did the dress work out?
- Yeah. It was great.

12:33.226 --> 12:38.163
You know, it was very glamorous.
Actually, I just came to return it. So...

12:39.632 --> 12:41.657
All right. Awesome!

12:43.336 --> 12:46.066
- You know, I...
- Daniel, could we...

12:46.105 --> 12:47.800
- Go ahead.
- You go.

12:50.510 --> 12:52.205
Uh...

12:52.345 --> 12:56.782
We just... We never got a chance
to talk about what happened.

12:56.816 --> 12:59.410
- You know, in the Closet.
- Yeah.

13:01.287 --> 13:03.881
I just... I wanted to tell you that...

13:03.923 --> 13:07.052
Hey, babe.
- Hey.

13:07.094 --> 13:09.153
- Ready for lunch?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:09.196 --> 13:11.756
Thanks for keeping
her company, mate.

13:11.799 --> 13:12.925
Bye.

13:22.309 --> 13:23.435
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

13:23.510 --> 13:25.740
You know,
I've been with a million women...

13:25.813 --> 13:30.978
Every time I'm around her,
it's like I just act like a stupid teenager.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.317
- Because you care for her.
- God, I'm such an idiot.

13:34.354 --> 13:37.846
Yes,
well, you're also human.

13:37.891 --> 13:42.692
You know, I swear Molly was just about
to say something important,

13:42.729 --> 13:44.924
and of course that's when
Connor came up and kissed her.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.332
<i>Well, maybe Mode's not the place
for that conversation.</i>

13:49.369 --> 13:51.860
Yeah, but what choice do I have?

13:51.905 --> 13:54.999
Well, you're both coming to my party
on Friday.

13:55.075 --> 13:57.670
Knowing Connor,
he'll be working the room.

13:57.745 --> 14:02.079
It's an opportunity for you to finish
your conversation, uninterrupted.

14:03.117 --> 14:04.607
Hmm.

14:08.623 --> 14:11.922
Here's my card.
Maybe we'll do business someday.

14:12.327 --> 14:15.023
"The Gorgeous Gourmet,"
that is catchy.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.428
- Here's mine.
- Thanks.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.024
- All right. Talk to you later.
- Okay.

14:19.634 --> 14:22.330
- Well, that wasn't so...
- Terrible.

14:22.370 --> 14:24.838
- Horrible.
- Could not have gone worse.

14:24.873 --> 14:28.809
You spent 22 minutes and 47 seconds
talking to a caterer.

14:28.877 --> 14:30.037
- A caterer!
- A caterer!

14:30.111 --> 14:33.137
- He was interesting.
- Useless!

14:33.214 --> 14:38.015
The point of networking is to gather
information to advance your career.

14:38.853 --> 14:40.684
Watch and learn.

14:42.123 --> 14:44.318
<i>Step one, forge a bond.</i>

14:44.359 --> 14:48.091
Your name, where you work
and one memorable fact.

14:48.130 --> 14:51.065
I'm Marc St. James,
I work for Wilhelmina Slater.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.728
I once had a threesome
with Jon Hamm and Mia Hamm.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.237
I call it
"The Night of the Hamm Sandwich. "

14:57.473 --> 14:59.907
- Well, that's ridiculous.
- It's memorable.

15:00.009 --> 15:02.773
- But it's a lie.
- Or is it?

15:02.811 --> 15:04.005
It is.

15:04.046 --> 15:06.412
Step two, gathering information.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.508
In order to get info,
you're going to have to give info.

15:09.585 --> 15:12.645
Do you know why Heidi Klum
never wears open-toed shoes?

15:12.688 --> 15:17.819
The trick is to make it sound juicy,
but really mean nothing.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.760
Twelve little piggies.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.025
I know, it's disgusting.
I'm not even kidding about that.

15:22.064 --> 15:24.430
So what were you saying
about next month's cover model?

15:24.466 --> 15:27.867
And most importantly, step three,
the exit strategy.

15:27.903 --> 15:30.235
Get in, get info, get out.

15:30.272 --> 15:34.834
See, I don't like to be rude.
I mean, how do you just stop someone

15:34.877 --> 15:37.472
in the middle of a conversation
without hurting their...

15:37.547 --> 15:40.175
Betty, could you just hold on one sec?

15:43.086 --> 15:44.110
Oh!

15:44.187 --> 15:47.213
Okay, I get it. Okay, Amanda. I get it.

15:48.391 --> 15:50.256
- Amanda?
- She's not coming back.

15:50.293 --> 15:52.989
And neither am I.
I've given you all I have to give.

15:53.029 --> 15:55.657
No, Marc! Don't go, I'm not ready.

15:55.699 --> 16:00.636
Yes, you are. You're a mean,
not-so-lean, contact-getting machine.

16:01.338 --> 16:04.739
You're the Terminator.
You're the Betty-nator.

16:08.011 --> 16:09.501
Go get them.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.098
<i>Okay, memorable fact.</i>

16:28.132 --> 16:29.827
I know a murderer.

16:35.606 --> 16:37.699
Thank you. Here's mine.

16:42.313 --> 16:45.248
<i>Give info that sounds juicy
but means nothing.</i>

16:45.282 --> 16:47.648
We totally hired that writer
to go to Milan.

16:47.685 --> 16:51.951
Just FYI, he has
a pay-per-view problem. Porn.

16:54.692 --> 16:57.889
<i>And what designer did you say
you'll be featuring this month?</i>

17:01.932 --> 17:04.332
That is very interesting.

17:07.238 --> 17:09.001
<i>Get info, get out.</i>

17:10.407 --> 17:13.536
Actually, could you excuse me
just one second?

17:15.512 --> 17:17.482
You were very interesting.

17:17.516 --> 17:21.474
37, 38, 39. Shoot. One more.

17:25.156 --> 17:30.060
- Hi. Betty Suarez. You are?
- Exhausted. I hate networking.

17:30.095 --> 17:33.394
Oh, my God, me, too!
I didn't know it was okay to admit that.

17:33.432 --> 17:34.490
What's gonna happen?

17:34.533 --> 17:37.331
The networking police
are gonna come and arrest us?

17:37.369 --> 17:40.167
Yeah, and like charge us
with "failure to chit-chat"?

17:41.440 --> 17:44.967
I just don't see how knowing that
that guy is into S&M

17:45.010 --> 17:47.911
is going to help my career.

17:47.946 --> 17:50.881
Especially because
that guy isn't in publishing.

17:50.916 --> 17:52.440
He's a dentist.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.448
I'm Teri. And I'm not doing this
to network, you just seem really nice.

17:59.558 --> 18:00.525
Oh.

18:04.029 --> 18:05.087
<i>Elle.</i>

18:05.130 --> 18:08.862
<i>Mode. Elle. Here we go.</i>

18:08.901 --> 18:12.064
I suppose we should be using
each other to get information.

18:12.105 --> 18:15.131
Yeah. No.

18:15.174 --> 18:18.974
I mean, we could just talk,
you know, like humans.

18:19.846 --> 18:21.711
Blue braces. Bold.

18:22.782 --> 18:27.019
- I like your pink stripe, it's cool.
- Thanks.

18:27.019 --> 18:31.285
I mean, it was 20 minutes. That's not
too long to spend on a caterer, right?

18:31.324 --> 18:34.657
Hell, no.
Plus, Gorgeous Gourmet totally rocks.

18:34.694 --> 18:36.924
They're doing our holiday party
this year.

18:36.963 --> 18:38.089
Oh!

18:38.965 --> 18:40.023
No.

18:41.868 --> 18:44.701
I'm gonna go clean that up.

18:44.737 --> 18:48.867
- This isn't my exit strategy, by the way.
- Didn't think it was.

18:48.908 --> 18:50.432
You know,
after all this fake networking,

18:50.476 --> 18:53.036
it's nice to meet someone
in the magazine industry who's real.

18:53.079 --> 18:55.172
Yeah. Same here.

18:55.248 --> 18:56.715
I'll be back.

19:10.998 --> 19:12.556
Hold the presses!

19:12.599 --> 19:14.863
I love your energy, Betty,
but now is not the time.

19:14.902 --> 19:18.269
<i>I just found out Elle is doing their
center spread in the Venice canals.</i>

19:18.305 --> 19:21.604
Just like we were.
So back to the drawing board.

19:21.642 --> 19:23.701
I know, I heard, but get this.

19:23.744 --> 19:26.212
<i>Elle booked Jessica Stam
for their cover shoot.</i>

19:26.246 --> 19:29.807
She just broke up with her Italian
boyfriend and refuses to go to Italy.

19:29.883 --> 19:32.078
So they're moving the whole shoot
to Paris.

19:32.152 --> 19:34.382
So Venice is back on! Nice work!

19:34.421 --> 19:35.786
You just earned yourself
a bottle of wine.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.858
I guess I'll be picking
that up for myself?

19:38.926 --> 19:42.225
- Yes. But I will be very generous.
- Thank you.

19:42.262 --> 19:45.789
You know, this whole networking thing
is really paying off for me.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.767
The only way I knew
about Jessica Stam

19:47.801 --> 19:50.270
<i>is Teri, my new business contact
who works at Elle.</i>

19:50.305 --> 19:53.001
I met her last night,
she gave me the whole inside scoop.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.702
And what did you have
to give up for that?

19:54.742 --> 19:56.937
That Peter Francis is handsy
with the models.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.242
- Everybody knows that.
- I know.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.510
Hey, Daniel, if it's not too much trouble,

20:01.549 --> 20:03.881
I was wondering if I could
just cut out early tonight?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.921
- My sister's got a thing.
- Actually, there is something.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.421
I don't mean to sound neurotic,

20:08.456 --> 20:10.981
but it would be really great
if you picked up the Halston dress

20:11.059 --> 20:14.358
rather than sending a messenger.
It's gonna be ready at 5:00.

20:14.395 --> 20:16.295
Oh, Um...

20:16.998 --> 20:18.932
Is that a problem?

20:18.967 --> 20:21.435
No. No problem.

20:26.074 --> 20:29.566
<i>Papi, thank you so much
for picking up these samples.</i>

20:29.611 --> 20:33.012
Tell Hilda I will be there
as soon as I can.

20:33.047 --> 20:35.572
I still don't understand
why you can't have someone else

20:35.650 --> 20:37.709
do this super-secret task.

20:37.785 --> 20:40.755
Because Daniel only trusts me to do it.

20:40.789 --> 20:44.418
And, Dad, I swear if it wasn't important,
I wouldn't be doing it.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.223
Well, your sister was counting on you.

20:46.262 --> 20:48.127
You know, the local paper's coming
to do a feature on her.

20:49.231 --> 20:50.562
She's a nervous wreck.

20:50.699 --> 20:53.668
She's gonna be so great.
She's so good with people.

20:53.702 --> 20:56.330
Hey, listen, I could always come
around early and help, if you want.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.440
Christina will come and help. Perfect.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.535
Betty, are you getting how much
this re-launch party means to Hilda?

21:02.578 --> 21:05.604
- She's putting everything into it.
- Dad, I get it.

21:05.648 --> 21:09.982
And I give you my word, I will be there.
Now, I really have to get going.

21:10.052 --> 21:13.988
Christina's gonna help you
finish in here, and I will see you soon.

21:14.056 --> 21:16.149
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:22.898 --> 21:24.661
Perfect. Thank you.

21:26.068 --> 21:27.126
Done.

21:27.169 --> 21:30.230
Wow, I can't even imagine what
this place is gonna look like tonight.

21:30.273 --> 21:33.674
The food, the drinks,
the New York media elite.

21:35.345 --> 21:38.542
- Is it as magical as it sounds?
- Yes, yes, yes.

21:38.581 --> 21:43.177
Now, the whole idea is to give Daniel
and Molly some time alone.

21:43.253 --> 21:46.689
So, first, I'll pull Connor aside
to meet Arianna Huffington.

21:46.723 --> 21:50.159
Oh, I've always wanted to meet her.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.592
Stop hinting, Marc. You're not invited.

21:52.629 --> 21:55.325
Now, while Connor is occupied
with Arianna,

21:55.365 --> 21:59.665
Daniel will swoop in, take Molly
into the bedroom, so they can talk.

21:59.703 --> 22:01.136
Juicy couture.

22:01.171 --> 22:03.571
And then you walk in with Connor
and see Daniel on top of Molly...

22:03.606 --> 22:06.939
No, no, no. Marc. I told you.
This is not a plan.

22:06.977 --> 22:12.677
Okay, I am just not getting this.
Maybe I need to be here to see it.

22:13.616 --> 22:14.981
Maybe not.

22:18.722 --> 22:20.190
Hey, Hilda.

22:20.224 --> 22:23.751
I tell you, Hilda, this is a great setup
you've got going here.

22:23.828 --> 22:26.194
You know, you can shop.
You can get your hair cut.

22:26.230 --> 22:29.495
Throw in a food court,
I would never leave.

22:29.533 --> 22:33.299
No, but listen, you must be
really proud of yourself, though.

22:33.337 --> 22:34.565
I am.

22:34.605 --> 22:38.473
I am. I've screwed up a lot, and I finally
feel like I'm getting my act together.

22:39.643 --> 22:43.602
This is the biggest thing I've ever done.
Not that my sister's noticed.

22:43.647 --> 22:47.344
No, I think she has.
She's just been really busy lately.

22:47.385 --> 22:50.582
Yeah, well, you can't live
your whole life for work.

22:50.654 --> 22:53.919
I'm re-opening my salon tonight,
I still got to Justin's school this morning

22:53.958 --> 22:56.449
to help with the bake sale.
It's about balance.

22:56.527 --> 22:59.928
Yeah, well, balance is something
you learn when you have to.

23:00.064 --> 23:02.498
Anyway, Betty's in a different place
right now.

23:02.533 --> 23:06.333
Yeah, I guess.
But we used to be so close.

23:06.871 --> 23:10.808
Now she's living in the city, she's got
this whole other life. You know?

23:10.842 --> 23:14.369
Sometimes, I just...
I want my little sister back.

23:14.413 --> 23:16.347
Aw! Yeah, I know.

23:18.683 --> 23:20.981
- Christina?
- Okay. God.

23:22.154 --> 23:23.951
How do you know
when you're in labor?

23:24.022 --> 23:26.855
If you have to ask, you're not in labor.

23:26.892 --> 23:27.881
Right, okay.

23:36.201 --> 23:37.691
- Excuse me.
- Shh!

23:42.808 --> 23:44.173
Yes, yes?

23:44.209 --> 23:47.372
<i>Hi, I'm from Mode magazine.</i>

23:47.412 --> 23:53.544
I'm here to pick up a Halston dress
from his Fireworks collection?

23:53.585 --> 23:57.783
Yes, yes. Someone from
your magazine already came and got it.

23:57.856 --> 23:59.687
What? Who?

24:01.094 --> 24:02.823
Betty Suarez.

24:02.862 --> 24:05.592
No, no. I'm Betty Suarez.

24:06.365 --> 24:08.731
No, no. She left a card.

24:13.873 --> 24:17.832
She had a rather horrible
pink stripe in her hair.

24:19.946 --> 24:21.072
Teri.

24:26.319 --> 24:27.946
Betty, you're fired.

24:27.987 --> 24:31.150
- You're not fired. Don't worry.
- Don't worry? Because of Betty,

24:31.224 --> 24:36.025
we almost lost Keira Knightley
and 30 pages of ad revenue.

24:36.062 --> 24:39.691
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

24:39.732 --> 24:41.597
At the club,
I got up to use the bathroom,

24:41.634 --> 24:45.263
and Teri must have taken
the information from my BlackBerry.

24:45.304 --> 24:48.205
I thought that she was a friend.

24:48.241 --> 24:50.300
Friendship is the oldest trick
in the book.

24:50.343 --> 24:51.675
Okay, let's not panic yet.

24:51.712 --> 24:54.613
<i>Elle may be rivals of ours,
but they're also businesspeople.</i>

24:54.648 --> 24:56.878
We can make this work, right?

24:58.819 --> 25:00.650
Marc, set up the call.

25:03.624 --> 25:07.617
Hello, Joe Zee, Robbie.
Nice to see you both.

25:07.694 --> 25:10.162
<i>- Thanks for taking our call.
- Anything for you, Daniel.</i>

25:10.230 --> 25:12.130
Robbie, I love the new 'do.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.794
<i>All that height
really makes a statement.</i>

25:14.868 --> 25:19.362
<i>Thanks, Willie. Those earrings
really make your face look small.</i>

25:19.406 --> 25:20.896
<i>Okay, so, listen, guys.</i>

25:20.941 --> 25:23.307
<i>We have reason to believe
that one of your assistants...</i>

25:23.343 --> 25:24.810
<i>Teri O'Shoughnessy.</i>

25:24.845 --> 25:28.747
<i>...may have taken a certain
Halston dress we have on hold.</i>

25:28.782 --> 25:30.113
<i>I don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

25:30.150 --> 25:32.812
That's her!
You're lying, Teri, and you know it!

25:32.853 --> 25:35.014
<i>Yeah? Prove it, brace-face!</i>

25:35.055 --> 25:37.387
Your pink stripe is stupid!

25:37.457 --> 25:39.584
Okay, enough, enough!
Betty.

25:39.660 --> 25:41.719
Listen, let's cut the bull.

25:41.795 --> 25:44.094
We all know you have the dress,

25:44.132 --> 25:47.533
you're holding it hostage
and trying to ruin our cover.

25:47.569 --> 25:51.198
<i>That's right. We heard you got
Keira Knightley for the cover.</i>

25:51.239 --> 25:54.140
<i>I hope this missing dress isn't gonna
be a big problem for you.</i>

25:54.175 --> 25:55.972
<i>Nice talking to you!</i>

25:57.245 --> 26:00.214
Consider yourselves dis-invited
from my cocktail party!

26:00.315 --> 26:04.911
<i>Yeah, they weren't coming anyway.
We're having our own party tonight!</i>

26:04.953 --> 26:06.580
<i>Betty, call me!</i>

26:09.924 --> 26:12.825
I could murder someone right now!

26:12.860 --> 26:14.919
Come on, it was a mistake.

26:14.996 --> 26:20.059
People who make mistakes like that
don't belong in this business.

26:20.101 --> 26:21.227
Marc!

26:24.806 --> 26:28.401
Daniel, I feel terrible. I'm sorry.

26:29.143 --> 26:31.008
This is my fault.

26:31.045 --> 26:36.143
If it's anyone's fault, it was mine.
I just should've had an editor handle it.

26:36.185 --> 26:39.882
No. Look, I can fix this. I could...

26:39.922 --> 26:42.254
I'll call the collector,
see if he has another gown.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.656
And I'll call Keira's publicist.

26:43.726 --> 26:45.353
- Betty.
- I'm sure if we got another dress...

26:45.427 --> 26:48.658
Betty, come on, go home.
I got it from here, okay?

27:04.913 --> 27:06.904
Thank you so much
for interviewing me.

27:06.949 --> 27:08.746
I've never been in a newspaper before.

27:08.784 --> 27:10.775
Yeah, well,
we're gonna need about 40 copies

27:10.819 --> 27:12.252
and photo approval, if possible.

27:12.288 --> 27:14.722
Well, I'm the surrogate,
so I'm not gonna be naming it.

27:14.757 --> 27:16.850
That's weird.
What does the father have to say?

27:16.925 --> 27:19.120
Not a lot. He died
before the baby was conceived.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.224
What?

27:23.867 --> 27:25.732
Poor Christina's going through
the pregnancy story again.

27:26.870 --> 27:29.031
Maybe you could go out there
and run interference.

27:29.072 --> 27:31.734
No, I'm not really
in a party kind of mood.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.608
<i>Are you still stewing
about that dress, mi hija?</i>

27:34.644 --> 27:36.771
You can deal with it on Monday.
Let it go.

27:36.813 --> 27:41.876
<i>Let it go? Dad, because of me,
Mode lost business today.</i>

27:41.918 --> 27:44.079
You didn't see the look
on Daniel's face.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.884
It's like he's losing faith in me.

27:46.923 --> 27:50.916
I just can't believe
that I let that Teri use me like that.

27:50.994 --> 27:53.827
In fact,
where's her stupid business card?

27:53.863 --> 27:56.933
I can't stand that it's anywhere
near my organ donor card.

27:56.933 --> 27:58.457
Mom wants to know
where the cheese cubes are,

27:58.535 --> 28:00.264
and crazy-fingernail lady
wants to know

28:00.370 --> 28:01.803
if we can spike her cider with rum.

28:01.838 --> 28:06.002
Here, take this.
I'll talk to crazy-fingernail lady.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.612
There you are, you big jerk, Teri.

28:19.924 --> 28:22.859
Thank you so much, Marc.
I'll see you there.

28:24.595 --> 28:28.156
Betty, my client is dying to meet you.
Where are you going?

28:28.232 --> 28:29.824
I'm so sorry, Hilda, but I have to go.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.765
Betty, the party's hardly even started.

28:31.802 --> 28:36.068
<i>I know, but I think I found a way I can
get that Halston dress back from Elle.</i>

28:36.107 --> 28:38.234
It's a long shot, but I'm gonna try.

28:38.275 --> 28:40.072
You know what would be nice?

28:40.111 --> 28:43.046
If you were excited about something
I was doing for a change.

28:43.080 --> 28:47.346
I am! I am! I just have to do this
really quick. I'll be right back.

28:47.385 --> 28:50.513
You know what, Betty? Don't bother.

28:50.554 --> 28:51.748
Hilda!

28:54.759 --> 28:58.217
<i>Papi, can you talk to her, please?
She's being ridiculous.</i>

28:58.262 --> 29:01.129
- No, she's not. You are.
- What?

29:01.198 --> 29:05.226
Do you have any idea how hard
Hilda worked to get all this ready?

29:05.270 --> 29:06.430
By herself, I might add.

29:06.471 --> 29:09.702
<i>That is not fair. Papi, this is my career.</i>

29:09.741 --> 29:12.471
I am working hard to try and move up,

29:12.511 --> 29:16.038
and if that means that I'm gonna miss
a family party every now and then,

29:16.081 --> 29:18.709
well then, I don't have a choice.
I have to do this.

29:18.750 --> 29:21.048
You do have a choice.
You're choosing to leave.

29:21.086 --> 29:22.417
- Dad.
- No, no.

29:22.454 --> 29:24.388
No one supports you
more than your family.

29:24.423 --> 29:27.459
We are always behind you 100%.

29:27.459 --> 29:30.121
But right now, Hilda needs you.

29:32.230 --> 29:35.666
<i>Papi, I am sorry that
you don't understand this,</i>

29:35.734 --> 29:37.395
but I have to go.

29:54.019 --> 29:57.251
Connor, Molly. So glad you made it.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.121
- Hey.
- Your place is amazing.

29:59.158 --> 30:01.388
What a great view of the city.

30:01.427 --> 30:02.553
Thanks, well,

30:02.628 --> 30:06.029
I love looking down at the little people
going about their little lives.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.162
Molly, dear,
do you mind if I steal Connor away?

30:10.203 --> 30:12.535
There's someone he has to meet.

30:16.809 --> 30:18.640
Excuse me, thanks.

30:20.279 --> 30:23.009
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:23.049 --> 30:24.573
Nice dress.

30:25.151 --> 30:28.279
Thanks. It's no Carlos Miele,
but it does the trick.

30:29.489 --> 30:33.220
I can't get over how beautiful this is.
It's breathtaking.

30:34.427 --> 30:38.386
Could... I'd like to ask you something.

30:38.464 --> 30:42.696
Do you mind if we just go somewhere
a little more private to talk?

30:44.270 --> 30:45.397
Okay.

30:50.010 --> 30:52.376
Ryan, thanks again
for helping us get in.

30:52.412 --> 30:55.347
No problem, you talked to me
for like 20 minutes at that bar.

30:55.382 --> 30:56.679
Nobody ever talks to the caterer.

30:56.750 --> 30:57.978
Well, you were very interesting.

30:58.018 --> 30:59.747
Tick-tock, Betty.
That dress ain't gonna walk itself out.

30:59.853 --> 31:01.684
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Good luck.

31:05.492 --> 31:10.327
Okay, I've been trying to figure out
the best way to say this,

31:10.397 --> 31:12.831
but there doesn't seem to be one.

31:16.003 --> 31:19.962
I haven't been able to get you
out of my mind since we met.

31:21.575 --> 31:24.908
- Daniel, I...
- Please, just let me finish.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.113
I know I shouldn't do this.

31:28.148 --> 31:30.981
I know it's bad and terrible and wrong,

31:31.018 --> 31:35.388
and I'm jeopardizing a friendship
and a business relationship.

31:35.423 --> 31:40.019
You can't believe how many times
I've tried to talk myself out of this.

31:41.863 --> 31:44.661
But I can't change the way I feel.

31:44.732 --> 31:48.532
Daniel, I'm engaged.

31:48.570 --> 31:51.334
Connor and I have been together
for almost four years.

31:51.372 --> 31:56.036
He's been through so much with me.
You have no idea how much.

31:56.077 --> 31:58.045
I don't want to hurt him.

31:58.079 --> 31:59.671
Neither do I.

32:00.815 --> 32:05.218
Molly, if you can honestly tell me

32:05.253 --> 32:07.778
you don't have feelings for me,

32:07.822 --> 32:10.882
I'll let you walk out that door,
get on with your life.

32:10.925 --> 32:14.793
I'll never say another word
about this again. I promise.

32:27.142 --> 32:30.634
So I lean across to her,
and I whisper, "That is Al Pacino. "

32:30.679 --> 32:33.614
And she says,
"I didn't order a cappuccino. "

32:35.117 --> 32:38.518
Zac, it's that accent. I mean,
who can understand a word he says?

32:38.554 --> 32:42.581
Who cares what he sounds like?
Look at the way he looks.

32:42.625 --> 32:45.253
So how long have you been dating?

32:45.294 --> 32:47.728
- No. We're not dating.
- No, no, no.

32:47.763 --> 32:51.722
I'm sorry. It's just...
You make the most divine couple.

32:53.569 --> 32:54.934
Excuse me.

33:00.142 --> 33:02.576
For the record,
I was extremely flattered by that.

33:03.679 --> 33:06.648
Any man in his right mind
would be proud to be with you.

33:06.682 --> 33:09.776
Well, we would make
quite the power couple.

33:10.653 --> 33:12.780
We definitely get
where each other's coming from.

33:12.821 --> 33:14.846
That can be hard to find.

33:16.860 --> 33:21.729
Connor, I have to admit,
ever since we had our business trip,

33:22.799 --> 33:25.393
I find it hard to be around you.

33:25.468 --> 33:29.302
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling too well.
Do you mind if we leave?

33:30.940 --> 33:35.377
No. Not at all.
Thank you for the party. It was lovely.

33:35.412 --> 33:37.312
Yes, thank you.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.929
Have you found it yet?

33:54.964 --> 33:57.023
Wait, here, I found the lights!

33:57.100 --> 33:58.089
Yay!

33:58.168 --> 34:00.227
There it is.

34:00.937 --> 34:03.428
Exactly where I said it would be.

34:03.473 --> 34:05.532
Thank you so much, Marc,
for helping me.

34:05.575 --> 34:07.043
I'm not doing this for you,

34:07.111 --> 34:09.545
I'm doing this to get a better
Christmas present from Wilhelmina.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.706
- That's the spirit.
- Oh, my God!

34:11.748 --> 34:14.114
They still do the ugly wall.

34:14.518 --> 34:18.648
This was totally my idea.
Every day, we would put up pictures

34:18.688 --> 34:21.351
of co-workers we hated
and then make fun of them.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.791
Good times.

34:24.128 --> 34:27.063
Hey, hurry up, Slowpoke Rodriguez.
I don't want to be here all night.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.532
Yeah, well, these vintage snaps
are very sensitive,

34:29.567 --> 34:31.159
and I don't want to tear the dress.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.395
Come on, let's go inside!

34:52.857 --> 34:55.985
- Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse us!
- Out of the way! Sorry!

34:56.025 --> 34:57.892
Pardon us,
we just have to get her to a taxi.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.487
She's really drunk. Excuse us.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.520
- No, no, no. This way.
- Yes!

35:00.632 --> 35:02.862
- No, wait!
- Elevators are this way. Elevators...

35:02.901 --> 35:04.698
What the hell are you doing?

35:04.736 --> 35:05.725
Um...

35:06.972 --> 35:10.169
We're taking our dress back!
Marc, run!

35:10.208 --> 35:13.371
- You're not going anywhere!
- Get out of here!

35:14.179 --> 35:16.010
Hold the elevator!

35:24.623 --> 35:26.523
Hey, Teri! Call me!

35:31.229 --> 35:34.721
<i>All is not as it seems</i>

35:36.067 --> 35:37.398
Thank you.

35:39.171 --> 35:42.937
I take it your conversation with Molly
didn't go very well.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.044
I guess we both lost out tonight, huh?

35:47.078 --> 35:49.809
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on.

35:49.849 --> 35:52.818
I'm not stupid.
I know you're interested in Connor.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.848
What would make you think that?

35:55.888 --> 36:00.848
Well, once I realized you didn't have
a business motive for helping me,

36:00.893 --> 36:03.760
I figured you must have a personal one.

36:03.796 --> 36:05.764
And I've seen the way you look at him.

36:05.798 --> 36:09.097
- Well, that's just...
- Relax.

36:09.135 --> 36:13.003
I'm not gonna hold the fact
that you're human against you.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.132
Your secret's safe with me.

36:28.521 --> 36:33.185
Well, well, well.
I can't say I'm not intrigued.

36:34.594 --> 36:38.895
I guess the three of you may come in.

36:46.006 --> 36:47.268
We're in!

36:48.809 --> 36:51.175
Pinch me! Don't touch me.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.912
You guys are unbelievable.

36:55.949 --> 36:58.577
- It was nothing.
- Well, it wasn't nothing.

36:58.619 --> 37:03.283
Well, either way. You two should stay,
enjoy yourselves. You deserve it.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.719
Oh, my God.

37:09.596 --> 37:10.893
This is a defining moment.

37:10.931 --> 37:14.594
I'm the first assistant who's ever been
invited to a Wilhelmina Slater party.

37:14.635 --> 37:17.832
- Well, I'm here, too.
- Not when I tell the story.

37:20.908 --> 37:23.502
Doors are really opening for us,
aren't they?

37:23.577 --> 37:25.272
It's all starting.

37:27.314 --> 37:32.220
Oh, my God,
there's Tom Wolfe and Zac Posen.

37:32.220 --> 37:34.211
- And...
- Jodie Papadakis!

37:53.174 --> 37:57.076
Well, this is the first time
I've ever seen an assistant

37:57.111 --> 37:59.170
at a Wilhelmina Slater function.

37:59.247 --> 38:01.613
Well, you know, just networking.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.313
I have all 40 of my new contacts,
by the way.

38:05.353 --> 38:06.820
- Do you?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:08.222 --> 38:12.215
Tell me, and this is important.
Have you tried the shrimp yet?

38:13.194 --> 38:16.027
- No.
- They're very spicy.

38:16.798 --> 38:18.493
Spicy!

38:19.234 --> 38:22.533
I can't figure out if I like them or not.
I think I do.

38:23.872 --> 38:26.705
Jodie, can I ask you a question?

38:26.742 --> 38:31.111
I have been a fan of yours
for a very long time now,

38:32.381 --> 38:37.182
and, well, I was wondering if you would
ever consider being my mentor?

38:38.153 --> 38:42.317
Let's start with me not kicking you
out of YETI,

38:44.193 --> 38:46.423
and we'll take it from there.

38:52.601 --> 38:55.229
<i>- Hi! Betty Suarez, Mode magazine.
- Well, how do you do?</i>

38:55.270 --> 38:57.500
I'm a very big fan of your publication.

39:07.683 --> 39:08.877
Hello?

39:10.220 --> 39:11.448
Justin?

39:34.210 --> 39:35.768
Hilda? Where are you?
What happened?

39:37.180 --> 39:39.444
<i>- We're at the hospital.
- What?</i>

39:40.583 --> 39:42.710
Oh, my God!
Did Christina go into labor?

39:42.752 --> 39:43.844
<i>No.</i>

39:44.187 --> 39:45.711
Betty.

39:47.157 --> 39:48.988
<i>Papi had a heart attack.</i>

39:50.260 --> 39:51.522
What?

40:18.656 --> 40:19.850
Molly.

40:25.396 --> 40:26.954
You were right.

40:28.699 --> 40:31.566
I can't say I don't have feelings for you.

40:39.743 --> 40:41.677
I broke up with Connor.

40:49.987 --> 40:53.116
<i>Oh, nothing's gonna change
my love for you</i>

40:54.493 --> 40:58.793
<i>I wanna spend my life with you</i>

41:01.199 --> 41:04.999
<i>So we make love on the grass
under the moon</i>

41:07.706 --> 41:11.107
<i>No one can tell, damned if I do</i>

41:12.811 --> 41:16.713
<i>Forever journeys on golden avenues</i>

41:17.649 --> 41:22.382
<i>I drift in your eyes since I love you</i>

41:25.290 --> 41:28.350
<i>I got that beat in my veins for only rule</i>

41:29.394 --> 41:33.831
<i>Love is to share, mine is for you</i>

41:34.305 --> 41:40.940
