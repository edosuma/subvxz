00:11.509 --> 00:14.239
FANE: The Confessor has broken
through the Boundary.

00:14.379 --> 00:16.711
I was a fool to think
this day would never come.

00:16.848 --> 00:19.248
She and these men,
they're from the Midlands.

00:19.384 --> 00:20.817
Take them down!

00:21.719 --> 00:22.777
Leave her alone.

00:22.921 --> 00:24.116
You did save my life.

00:24.256 --> 00:25.348
I should have thanked you.

00:25.491 --> 00:26.549
Confessors?

00:26.692 --> 00:29.991
An ancient order of women,
sworn to find the truth.

00:30.129 --> 00:34.429
And if a Seeker should arise,
to protect him with her life.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.832
He is the first true Seeker
in the last thousand years.

00:37.970 --> 00:40.768
- He has a destiny.
- Who are you to decide a man's destiny?

00:40.906 --> 00:42.737
It's not me, it's the Prophecy.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.502
Prophecy be damned.

00:44.643 --> 00:46.702
- What does that have to do with me?
ZEDD: Years ago,

00:46.845 --> 00:50.246
a great prophet spoke
of the birth of a true Seeker.

00:50.382 --> 00:53.545
A child whose destiny would be
to seek out and kill

00:53.686 --> 00:56.554
the greatest evil of all:
Darken Rahl.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.623
<i>KAHLAN: It's The Book
of Counted Shadows.</i>

00:59.759 --> 01:02.626
The Book contains
the secrets of power.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.251
And if Darken Rahl gets it,

01:04.397 --> 01:07.560
he will use it to control
every corner of the world.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.793
RICHARD:
Who did this?

01:08.935 --> 01:11.961
The D'Haran. Rannsyn Fane.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.697
He murdered our father.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.832
Not our father. My father.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.940
RICHARD:
Fane!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.277
KAHLAN: The Book.
RICHARD: Fane has it.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.645
I've lost everything.

01:25.785 --> 01:28.687
ZEDD: You have a great destiny
ahead of you, Richard Cypher.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.448
If you're willing to accept it.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.726
Teach me.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.624
KAHLAN:
This is the Sword of Truth.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.425
ZEDD:
It bestows the power to fight evil.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.535

you will kill Darken Rahl.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.054
RICHARD:
Here's the river.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.454
Fane went east
towards the Boundary, here.

02:04.593 --> 02:06.458
KAHLAN: How will we catch up
without a bridge to cross?

02:06.595 --> 02:08.460
ZEDD: There used to be
another bridge south of here,

02:08.597 --> 02:09.723
but it washed away.

02:09.865 --> 02:11.332
I rebuilt it.

02:11.466 --> 02:13.366
So we'll cross here,

02:13.502 --> 02:16.096
and we'll double back
and pick up his trail, there.

02:16.238 --> 02:17.500
Fane is on a fast horse.

02:17.639 --> 02:19.197
RICHARD:
He doesn't know these woods like I do.

02:19.341 --> 02:21.707
And he can't travel fast,
especially at night.

02:21.843 --> 02:24.710
You could know every tree by name
and he'd still have a long lead.

02:24.846 --> 02:28.577
On his way to a boundary
that he has no way of crossing.

02:30.752 --> 02:32.515
Then he must believe he can find a way.

02:35.491 --> 02:38.187
Then why are we still
standing here talking?

I've known you since you were
crawling on all fours.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.503

02:54.644 --> 02:55.872
I wanna help you,

02:56.913 --> 02:58.141
but first, you need to tell me

02:58.281 --> 03:01.250
what in the name of the Spirits
is going on?

03:03.086 --> 03:06.887
I've been so grateful to you
all these years, Fraden.

03:07.024 --> 03:10.118
I believed you had done
more for me than anyone,

03:10.260 --> 03:12.455
and I rewarded you accordingly.

03:12.596 --> 03:15.326
You've been very generous,
Lord Rahl.

03:15.466 --> 03:18.401
But now I find that you
have failed me.

03:18.535 --> 03:20.469
No, My Lord,
I did exactly as you commanded.

03:20.604 --> 03:23.300
My men and I killed every
first-born son in Brennidon.

03:24.041 --> 03:25.838
Except the one that mattered.

03:27.845 --> 03:30.405
You let him slip
through your fingers.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.646
Is it possible
My Lord is mistaken?

03:34.785 --> 03:38.313
Twenty-three years
I have slept in peace,

03:38.456 --> 03:40.447
certain that I'd averted the Prophecy.

03:41.493 --> 03:43.120
But then, tonight,

03:43.261 --> 03:46.924
it came to me
in a terrible dream.

03:47.065 --> 03:49.863
I saw him take the Sword.

03:50.735 --> 03:52.498
There's no mistake.

03:52.637 --> 03:54.832
The Seeker has been named.

03:55.407 --> 03:57.432
Then let me assemble my men.

03:57.575 --> 03:59.600
I'll find him and complete the task.

03:59.744 --> 04:02.474
And how will you do that?

04:02.614 --> 04:04.309
The Seeker
is a thousand leagues from here,

04:04.449 --> 04:06.781
on the other side of the Boundary.

04:06.918 --> 04:09.682
Will your weary old bones
carry you that far?

04:11.357 --> 04:12.790
Do you have a way across?

04:12.925 --> 04:15.723
If this Confessor found a way,
so can we.

04:17.762 --> 04:21.028
I appreciate the sentiment,
old friend,

04:22.134 --> 04:25.035
but it's time to let younger men
take up the cause.

04:26.338 --> 04:28.806
As My Lord wishes.

04:29.341 --> 04:30.808

of all the ancient Seekers

21:28.258 --> 21:29.452

28:26.923 --> 28:28.515
Your Seeker here saved her life.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.895
How is he?

28:35.031 --> 28:36.862
He's the same.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.241
ADIE:
His skin be burning hot.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.536
This be Shadow poison at work.

28:48.678 --> 28:49.906
Can you help him?

28:50.046 --> 28:51.411
ADIE:
Adie has her ways.

28:51.948 --> 28:53.074
She will do what she can.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.308
We'll leave him with you.

28:55.451 --> 28:58.319
- We'll come back after we get the Book.
- We should go.

28:58.455 --> 29:02.289
From here, Fane has less than an hour
before he gets back to the Boundary.

29:02.426 --> 29:05.327
And with Adie's Nightstone
he be able to walk through it.

29:05.462 --> 29:08.124
- We should hurry.
- No. Chase, you've done enough.

29:08.265 --> 29:11.029
You get Laura home, and you make sure
the rest of your family is safe.

29:11.168 --> 29:12.260
You need help, Richard.

29:12.903 --> 29:14.131
That's what I have Kahlan for.

29:15.472 --> 29:17.940
And like she said when we first met,

29:18.075 --> 29:20.543
she can take care of herself.

29:22.446 --> 29:23.743
If you need me, my friend,

29:23.880 --> 29:26.747
you send word, and I'll be there
as fast as a horse can take me.

29:27.818 --> 29:29.251
It could be a long ride, Chase.

29:29.386 --> 29:31.548
There's no ride too long.

29:42.867 --> 29:45.233
Let's fine Fane.

30:40.293 --> 30:41.624
There. To the south.

30:42.629 --> 30:44.324
Realign the weapon
and aim for the lights.

Yes, sir.

30:50.904 --> 30:52.166
Give me the Book.

30:55.442 --> 30:56.500
Kill them.

30:58.344 --> 31:01.336
I said give me the Book.

31:01.481 --> 31:04.882
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet, boy?

31:05.018 --> 31:07.350
As a matter of fact, I have.

31:08.489 --> 31:09.854
Ah!

32:16.192 --> 32:18.353
FANE:
Argh!

32:49.660 --> 32:51.560
You did it.

32:54.565 --> 32:56.499
You are the Seeker.

Stay back!

That's the second time
you saved my life.

- Looks like I missed the excitement.
- Zedd.

39:15.724 --> 39:16.952
You're alive.

39:17.092 --> 39:19.390
Takes more than a little
Shadow poison to kill me, boy.

39:21.263 --> 39:22.696
He burned the Book.

39:23.632 --> 39:24.690
I had to.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.164
It was the only way I could see
to keep it from the D'Harans.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.572
How will he fulfill the Prophecy now?

39:33.875 --> 39:36.639
Sounds to me like he's already started.

39:37.346 --> 39:38.506
I don't understand.

39:39.514 --> 39:41.709
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but doesn't the Prophecy say

39:41.850 --> 39:46.345
the Seeker will use the Book
in his quest to defeat Darken Rahl?

39:47.256 --> 39:48.917
He did use the Book,

39:49.058 --> 39:51.549
just not in the way we expected.

39:52.795 --> 39:57.528
More importantly, he kept the Book
from getting into Rahl's hands.

39:57.667 --> 39:59.931
Being the Seeker means
making difficult choices.

40:01.037 --> 40:03.870
And Richard made
the first of many today.

40:04.007 --> 40:06.271
What about all the secrets
the Book was said to contain?

40:06.409 --> 40:10.243
How will he defeat Rahl
without knowing them?

40:10.380 --> 40:12.507
Well, it appears the Seeker's quest

40:12.649 --> 40:14.947
isn't going to come
with an instruction manual.

40:19.757 --> 40:22.419
Where to now?

40:22.559 --> 40:24.083
The Boundary is open.

40:24.228 --> 40:26.822
We can go either way.

40:36.006 --> 40:38.975
Well, like a wise man once told me,

40:39.109 --> 40:42.010
"In this life, you can't go back.

40:42.146 --> 40:43.306
Only forward."

Spoken like the true Seeker.

41:04.769 --> 41:07.670
SOLDIER: My Lord, one of our sorcerers
from the Boundary

41:07.806 --> 41:09.239
has sent news from Kaldrith.

41:09.374 --> 41:11.774
He was the only survivor
of his artillery battery.

41:14.813 --> 41:16.144
The only survivor?

41:16.281 --> 41:18.181
Yes, My Lord.

41:18.316 --> 41:20.716
They succeeded in penetrating
the Boundary,

41:21.252 --> 41:23.813
but the Seeker killed them all.

41:23.956 --> 41:25.321
The Book?

41:25.891 --> 41:27.483
Destroyed, My Lord.

41:31.230 --> 41:33.130
Well, then,

41:33.265 --> 41:37.133
it would seem the Seeker and I
are on an even footing.

41:37.269 --> 41:38.896
My Lord,

41:39.038 --> 41:41.802
the Seeker travels only
with a Wizard and a Confessor.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.968
You have tens of thousands
of subjects and soldiers

41:45.111 --> 41:48.274
who will obey your every command.

41:50.049 --> 41:54.817
Then let it be known
throughout the three territories,

41:54.955 --> 41:57.753
that whoever brings me the Seeker

41:57.891 --> 42:01.520
will be rewarded beyond imagining.

42:06.633 --> 42:08.601

So where are we going, exactly?

42:08.735 --> 42:10.362
ZEDD:
To find Rahl, of course.

42:10.504 --> 42:11.562
KAHLAN:
Won't be easy.

42:11.705 --> 42:15.163
He moves from palace to palace,
temple to temple.

42:15.308 --> 42:17.208
His spies are everywhere.

42:17.344 --> 42:19.938
And it's said he has magic
to cloak his movements

42:20.080 --> 42:22.674
and disguise his appearances.

42:22.816 --> 42:24.943
So how will we find him?

42:25.085 --> 42:28.852
One step at a time, my boy.
One step at a time.

42:28.990 --> 42:32.221
Because where we don't find Rahl,
we'll find his emissaries,

42:32.360 --> 42:36.126
and innocent people who need
protection from his dark magic.

42:36.264 --> 42:40.257
Mark my words, you'll get plenty
of use out of that sword.

42:40.401 --> 42:41.698
I'll be ready.
