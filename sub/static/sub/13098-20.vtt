00:01.667 --> 00:04.042
[instrumental music]

00:06.000 --> 00:08.750
(Sinclair)
Good morning,
lieutenant commander.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.583
Morning.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.875
Nothing personal.
But you look like hell.

00:12.958 --> 00:16.000
I know, I know.
C&amp;C woke me up an hour early.

00:16.083 --> 00:20.625
They're picking up some unusual
Tachyon emissions in Sector 14.

00:20.708 --> 00:23.042
I looks pretty routine,
but I authorized Alpha Seven

00:23.125 --> 00:24.708
to go check it out,
just in case.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.250
Sector 14? That's a pretty
long haul in normal space.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.750
Three hours. He should be
there fairly soon.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.042
[yawns]

00:32.125 --> 00:33.833
- God! I hate mornings.
- We noticed.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.625
Personally, I find it
the best part of the day.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.583
Ah, me too.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.042
We all have our cross to bear.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.958
The time learned to really
appreciate mornings

00:41.042 --> 00:44.625
was during the three years I
spent being taught by Jesuits.

00:44.708 --> 00:48.000
We used to get up at 5 o'clock
every morning for sunrise mass.

00:48.083 --> 00:51.333
Then an hour of meditation
before class.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.458
We would sit..

00:53.542 --> 00:56.417
...quiet, at peace.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.833
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:02.167 --> 01:05.417
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:07.292 --> 01:09.542
Breathing in

01:09.625 --> 01:11.083
breathing out.

01:17.708 --> 01:20.792
[instrumental music]

01:25.417 --> 01:26.792
- Well!
- What?

01:26.875 --> 01:28.750
Boy, that was great.
Boy, just hit the spot.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.417
I see you cleaned
your plate too.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.167
- Guess I better get going.
- Me too, it's nearly 7:30.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.542
7:30? I-I didn't even..

01:35.625 --> 01:38.208
I slept through breakfast?
This isn't fair!

01:38.292 --> 01:40.625
- Something, Lt. Commander?
- No, nothing, I'm fine.

01:40.708 --> 01:42.083
I'm fine.
You'll have to excuse me.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.958
Uh, C&amp;C, this is Ivanova,
I realize I'm late

01:44.042 --> 01:45.625
but I'm on my way.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.167
I'll notify your next of kin.

01:57.708 --> 02:01.708
Four, three, two, one.

02:01.792 --> 02:05.000
(Ivanova)
'Oh! Garibaldi,
you're a dead man!'

02:09.833 --> 02:14.667
Alpha Seven to Babylon Control,
I'm closing on target.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.292
Registering increasing
Tachyon emissions.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.125
- Visual sightings?
- 'Negative.'

02:19.208 --> 02:22.083
Nothing yet. Stand by.

02:22.167 --> 02:24.917
Babylon Control, I'm getting
something on the scanner.

02:26.750 --> 02:30.000
Confirmed, Babylon Control.
There's something out here.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.167
- Can you identify, Alpha Seven?
- No, not quite.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.333
I can't make it out. It..

02:35.750 --> 02:39.125
No. That's not possible.

02:40.417 --> 02:43.167
That can't be,
it just can't be. It..

02:43.667 --> 02:46.042
No!

02:46.125 --> 02:49.750
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:49.833 --> 02:52.875
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:52.958 --> 02:56.375
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.875
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

02:59.958 --> 03:01.208
where humans and aliens

03:01.292 --> 03:03.792
could work out
their differences.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.875
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:06.958 --> 03:08.833
for diplomats, hustlers

03:08.917 --> 03:12.042
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.792
Humans and aliens, wrapped in

03:13.875 --> 03:16.250
two million five hundred
thousand tons

03:16.333 --> 03:20.208
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.792
It can be a dangerous place.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.917
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.458
The year is 2258.

03:33.542 --> 03:37.417
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.375
[theme music]

04:15.750 --> 04:17.792
[instrumental music]

04:17.875 --> 04:21.000
Babylon Control to Alpha Seven,
please respond.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.208
Babylon Control to Alpha Seven.

04:25.292 --> 04:28.333
[sighs]
There's nothing, commander.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.750
- What about the homing beacon?
- We're still receiving.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.875
Based on trajectory the fighter
seems to be returning to base.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.833
ETA, one hour
and fifteen minutes.

04:36.917 --> 04:39.042
But we can't raise the pilot
on any of the open frequencies.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.292
It's possible that what ever
he ran into out there

04:41.375 --> 04:42.875
fired his communication system.

04:42.958 --> 04:45.333
Are you still picking up those
unusual Tachyon emissions?

04:45.417 --> 04:47.083
Yes, we had another burst
just about the same time

04:47.167 --> 04:49.042
we lost contact
with Alpha Seven.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.292
And then it seemed to stabilize.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.583
Better notify Dr. Franklin

04:51.667 --> 04:52.917
tell him to have Medlab
standing by

04:53.000 --> 04:54.417
in case of injury.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.958
(male #1)
'Minbari Flyers unit,
you are clear for jump.'

04:59.000 --> 05:00.792
Thank you, Babylon Control.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.708
'Are you sure you don't
require a pilot, ambassador?'

05:03.792 --> 05:07.458
Quite sure.
Some things one must do alone.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.458
I believe I'm ready to proceed.

05:11.542 --> 05:14.458
At your discretion,
Babylon Control.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.667
[zapping]

05:22.875 --> 05:25.167
Alpha Seven coming into
scanner range.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.958
[dramatic music]

05:28.042 --> 05:31.042
Alpha Seven, you're clear
to dock. Proceed to main bay.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.083
Well, that's strange,
he's just sitting there.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.250
He's not approaching
the docking bay.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.208
Run a full scan of Alpha Seven.

05:40.292 --> 05:42.042
On it.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.125
[beeping]

05:47.583 --> 05:50.667
No structural damage.
Hull integrity looks fine.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.292
Life signs..

05:56.083 --> 05:58.083
There's no life signs.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.042
'Commander, he's dead.'

06:01.000 --> 06:03.625
[dramatic music]

06:03.708 --> 06:06.417
- What was the cause of death?
- Well, commander, it's, uh..

06:06.500 --> 06:07.667
Well, it's hard to explain.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.000
There was no damage to the body

06:09.083 --> 06:10.375
no shock, no trauma.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.250
Everything points to death
by natural causes.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.625
So why is that hard to explain?

06:13.708 --> 06:16.042
Because in this case
the natural was old age.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.458
Come on, Garibaldi,
he just turned 30.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.583
I know, and he looked fine
from the outside

06:19.667 --> 06:21.000
but the doc says
his internal organs

06:21.083 --> 06:22.667
were like those of a man
three times his age.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.792
Then how'd he get back here?

06:23.875 --> 06:24.792
As best we can tell,

06:24.875 --> 06:25.917
just before he died he managed

06:26.000 --> 06:27.125
to set the ship's autopilot

06:27.208 --> 06:28.583
to bring him back
to the station.

06:28.667 --> 06:29.792
Recommend we send a team out
to investigate.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.208
Find out what's going on
out there.

06:31.292 --> 06:32.542
If there's a hazard to
navigation--

06:32.625 --> 06:33.625
Not yet, not until we have

06:33.708 --> 06:34.958
a better idea what we're facing.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.375
Meanwhile I want all traffic

06:36.458 --> 06:38.125
routed clear of Sector 14.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.500
Michael,
I want that ship examined

06:39.583 --> 06:40.750
with a fine-tooth comb.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.792
'Something fatal
happened out there'

06:42.875 --> 06:44.292
I wanna know what.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.375
[whirring]

06:53.917 --> 06:56.083
Begin monitoring for beacon.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.708
[instrumental music]

07:02.333 --> 07:04.792
Our people just finished going
over Alpha Seven's fighter.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.000
This is the buckle off
the pilots safety harness.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.667
Looks like he managed to scratch
something into it

07:08.750 --> 07:10.833
before he died.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.167
"B4."

07:13.250 --> 07:15.125
B4? As in Babylon4?

07:15.208 --> 07:16.583
What I can't figure is why.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.167
B4 vanished without a trace
over four years ago.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.875
- I don't get it.
- Nor should you.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.833
Without one other piece
of information.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.083
I ran a check on Sector 14.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.667
The Tachyon emissions are coming
from the exact location

07:27.750 --> 07:29.833
where Babylon 4 disappeared.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.292
Maybe what happened to B4
is happening again?

07:32.375 --> 07:34.000
That's one possibility.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.333
There is another.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.458
What if..

07:37.542 --> 07:39.292
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

07:39.375 --> 07:42.708
We just started picking up
a distress signal in Sector 14.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.333
I thought I ordered all ships
to stay clear of that area.

07:45.417 --> 07:46.708
- 'Affirmative.'
- Then who?

07:46.792 --> 07:49.417
'The distress call identifies
itself as..'

07:50.417 --> 07:52.750
'Commander, it's Babylon 4.'

07:53.458 --> 07:55.583
We're on our way.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.708
- Is the signal on-line?
- It's shaky but it's there.

08:00.792 --> 08:01.917
You want me to patch it through?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.042
Not yet.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.417
Ivanova, check the archives

08:04.500 --> 08:07.583
and get me the secure code
for Babylon 4.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.708
Ever since the war,
every Earthforce command

08:09.792 --> 08:11.625
and control center was
configured to broadcast

08:11.708 --> 08:13.500
its ID code on a sub channel.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.333
Sort of a tag to prevent
counterfeit orders?

08:15.417 --> 08:16.792
- Exactly.
- Coming up.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.625
The archival ID and the one
we're getting now.

08:18.708 --> 08:23.833
(computer)
Coded signal matches 100%
to archival code.

08:23.917 --> 08:27.083
'Babylon 4 recognition signal
confirmed.'

08:27.167 --> 08:28.417
(Garibaldi)
'This is nuts.'

08:28.500 --> 08:30.250
A station just doesn't disappear
and reappear

08:30.333 --> 08:32.458
four years later like
some kind of Flying Dutchman.

08:32.542 --> 08:35.625
- Only one way to find out.
- Let's see it.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.708
Repeat, Earth Station

08:39.792 --> 08:41.458
Babylon 4 requesting help.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.292
We need assistance.

08:43.375 --> 08:47.292
I repeat, Earth Station
Babylon 4 requesting help!

08:47.375 --> 08:50.333
This is Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair of Bab..

08:50.417 --> 08:53.458
This is Earthforce Commander
Sinclair. We read you.

08:53.542 --> 08:56.417
- What is your situation?
- Oh, thank God.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.125
We don 't know.
Have to abandon ship!

08:59.208 --> 09:02.208
We're caught
in some kind of flux.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.625
Power's at 30%.
Ship's damaged.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.333
'We need help to evacuate'

09:06.417 --> 09:08.083
'we must get help
before it's too late.'

09:08.167 --> 09:10.167
- What's your crew complement?
- Uh..

09:10.250 --> 09:13.167
Skeleton crew,
1200, maybe 1300.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.625
We'd just gone operational
when..

09:19.458 --> 09:21.667
'Oh, God.'

09:21.750 --> 09:24.625
It's starting again.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.708
It's starting ag..

09:26.792 --> 09:28.958
The signal's too weak.
We lost it.

09:29.042 --> 09:31.167
And one more thing,
the date stamp on the message

09:31.250 --> 09:32.917
is four years out of date.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.042
You're not starting to believe
this, are you?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.958
It can't be Babylon 4.
It's impossible.

09:38.042 --> 09:40.583
What's the maximum we can
evacuate at any time?

09:40.667 --> 09:43.542
About 250, using half our
shuttles in swing shifts.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.250
'That's five round trips,
90 minutes turnaround.'

09:46.333 --> 09:48.000
- Figure Ten hours total.
- Good.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.333
I want a fighter escort prepped
and ready to launch immediately.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.875
We're going to find Babylon 4.

09:53.958 --> 09:57.000
[dramatic music]

10:02.083 --> 10:04.333
[instrumental music]

10:09.042 --> 10:11.125
(Sinclair)
So I won't lie to you.

10:11.208 --> 10:14.583
We don't know for sure
what's waiting for us out there.

10:14.667 --> 10:17.208
All we do know is that we've
already had one man killed

10:17.292 --> 10:20.917
while investigating Sector 14.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.792
We're still picking up
unusual Tachyon emissions..

10:24.875 --> 10:29.708
...possibly related to Babylon
4's alleged reappearance.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.625
'We don't know what effect'

10:31.708 --> 10:33.417
those highly concentrated
emissions

10:33.500 --> 10:36.042
will have on our ships

10:36.125 --> 10:38.833
or the people inside.

10:38.917 --> 10:42.542
There's a definite risk factor
at work here.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.917
If anyone wants to pull out

10:45.000 --> 10:47.667
now's the time.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.917
No questions will be asked.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.750
Alright. Saddle up.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.083
We hit space in 20 minutes.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.917
Let's go, Mike.

11:05.292 --> 11:07.542
Fighter Squadron Zeta,
you're cleared to launch.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.708
[whirring]

11:14.000 --> 11:16.042
[dramatic music]

11:17.792 --> 11:21.417
Escort Wing, you're cleared
to launch on my mark. Mark.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.583
All ships escort position,
and coordinate homing beacons.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.917
Maintain formation
until contact.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.792
Babylon Control, if you don't
hear from us in eight hours

11:35.875 --> 11:39.250
'notify Earth Central, but
do not send additional ships.'

11:39.333 --> 11:41.875
(Ivanova)
'Confirmed, commander.
Good luck.'

11:41.958 --> 11:44.792
Alright, let's get this show
on the road.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.667
'ETA, two hours,
fifty-seven minutes.'

11:51.000 --> 11:54.042
[intense music]

12:18.542 --> 12:20.542
Time to target?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.875
Two hours, three minutes.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.875
This is the part I hate most.
The waiting.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.417
Hm.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.375
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Sure.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.208
Okay, it's morning, you're
gettin' ready to go to work

12:39.292 --> 12:41.000
you pull on your pants,
do you fasten, then zip

12:41.083 --> 12:42.583
or zip and then fasten?

12:42.667 --> 12:44.500
What kind of question is that?

12:44.583 --> 12:45.875
Well, look,
we got two hours to kill.

12:45.958 --> 12:49.125
- Forget it.
- Just a question.

12:49.208 --> 12:52.500
- Why do you wanna know?
- Why do I wanna know?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.833
Because I think of these
things sometimes.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.458
I was getting dressed
this morning, for a second

12:56.542 --> 12:58.167
I couldn't remember
which I did first.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.500
I started thinkin' about it.

12:59.583 --> 13:00.708
Does everybody do it
the same way?

13:00.792 --> 13:02.500
Is it a left handed,
right handed thing?

13:02.583 --> 13:03.958
Do you think about
this stuff a lot?

13:04.042 --> 13:05.917
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.958
Look, okay, I'm sorry I asked.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.083
Now, you're always so serious
all the time.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.292
Not every conversation has to be

13:11.375 --> 13:12.792
the end of the world
as we know it.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.708
- I didn't mean to--
- Never mind, i-it's okay.

13:15.792 --> 13:19.000
I'll just watch my console.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.583
Don't worry about it.

13:24.042 --> 13:25.458
[sighs]

13:28.458 --> 13:31.833
- Fasten then zip. You?
- Fasten, zip.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.625
[chuckling]

13:36.542 --> 13:38.042
How much longer?

13:39.458 --> 13:42.208
One hour, fifty-seven minutes.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.208
You wanna talk socks?

13:44.292 --> 13:45.875
- No.
- It's just a question.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.125
I'm not having
this conversation.

13:50.167 --> 13:53.208
[dramatic music]

14:23.042 --> 14:26.125
[music continues]

14:51.250 --> 14:54.417
Summoned, I come.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.458
In Valen's name,
I take the place

14:57.542 --> 15:00.208
that has been prepared for me.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.292
I am Grey.

15:02.375 --> 15:06.542
I stand between the candle
and the star.

15:07.667 --> 15:10.125
We are Grey.

15:10.208 --> 15:15.125
We stand between the darkness
and the light.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.125
[instrumental music]

15:34.083 --> 15:36.417
We welcome you, Delenn.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.958
For too long the nine
have been eight.

15:40.042 --> 15:41.500
Your task has been necessary

15:41.583 --> 15:45.000
but your absence
has diminished us.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.250
'We rejoice at your return.'

15:47.333 --> 15:49.833
It is my honor to serve.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.500
Why have I been called?

15:52.583 --> 15:55.833
It has been ten cycles
since Dukhat left this world

15:55.917 --> 15:59.208
to take his place with Valen
and the nine who were.

15:59.292 --> 16:03.417
Ten cycles since our people
have had a leader.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.542
The time of mourning
is complete.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.333
We must now choose another.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.875
In your absence,
we have discussed

16:14.958 --> 16:17.292
debated, prayed for guidance.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.333
'We must choose wisely
and well.'

16:19.417 --> 16:21.875
Why was I not told
of these deliberations?

16:21.958 --> 16:24.375
We thought it best
in light of our decision.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.542
You have been chosen to lead us.

16:27.625 --> 16:31.375
Of all the council, you have
seen most, traveled most

16:31.458 --> 16:35.333
know much of the other species,
their worlds and governments.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.542
There could be no other choice.

16:37.625 --> 16:41.083
My calling is to serve,
not to lead.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.542
My work on Babylon 5--

16:42.625 --> 16:45.417
- Is concluded.
- But the prophecy..

16:45.500 --> 16:48.958
Prophecy will attend to itself.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.875
We will pray guidance

16:50.958 --> 16:53.417
and select another
to take your place.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.125
From this day forward,
your place is with the council

16:57.208 --> 17:00.250
with your people, as leader.

17:00.333 --> 17:04.000
You have carried your burden
long enough.

17:04.083 --> 17:07.958
It must be a great relief
knowing you will never again

17:08.042 --> 17:10.917
'return to Babylon 5.'

17:13.917 --> 17:15.542
[whizzing]

17:15.625 --> 17:17.667
Entering Sector 14,
picking up intensity

17:17.750 --> 17:19.875
Tachyon emissions.
Anything on the screen?

17:19.958 --> 17:21.833
Not yet.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.583
It's.. Hang on.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.792
The scanners are picking up
an object.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.708
- 'It's big, alright.'
- 'Confirmed, it's..'

17:29.792 --> 17:31.708
Son of a gun.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.917
Babylon 4.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.708
Signal the others.
We're going in.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.917
[whizzing]

17:47.958 --> 17:49.667
[instrumental music]

17:49.750 --> 17:52.417
(Sinclair)
'We're hitting some kind of
distortion field.'

17:52.500 --> 17:54.125
Tachyon emissions up 50%.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.875
Shuttle One to Escort Wing,
take position

17:55.958 --> 17:58.250
'18 kilometers
from the station and hold.'

17:58.333 --> 18:00.625
We'll go in and check it out
first, once we know it's clear

18:00.708 --> 18:03.125
we'll signal you to proceed
with the evacuation.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.500
Let's do it.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.917
[dramatic music]

18:40.583 --> 18:43.625
[music continues]

19:09.625 --> 19:11.583
[zapping]

19:12.333 --> 19:14.708
Monsters! I'll stop you!

19:15.500 --> 19:17.167
'I know who you are!'

19:18.875 --> 19:20.583
You want him?

19:20.667 --> 19:22.500
- Your turn.
- You sure?

19:22.583 --> 19:24.083
I'll cover you.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.083
I see you! You think I can't?

19:34.875 --> 19:37.917
[intense music]

19:41.250 --> 19:43.250
[zapping]

19:43.333 --> 19:45.750
I gotta get off this station!

19:45.833 --> 19:47.667
Come on and show yourselves!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
[grunting]

19:51.792 --> 19:54.458
Come on! Easy, easy, easy!

19:57.458 --> 19:58.750
- Gotta get out of here!
- Relax.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.917
Hold it! It's alright.
We'll take him.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.417
[whimpering]
I-I gotta get out of here.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.750
Major Lewis Krantz, Babylon 4.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.458
Assigned to supervise the final
stages of construction.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.708
Commander Sinclair.

20:11.792 --> 20:14.042
This is my security chief,
Michael Garibaldi.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.333
Oh, thank God you're here.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.583
Was your ship passing
through this sector?

20:17.667 --> 20:20.792
Not exactly.
We're from another station.

20:20.875 --> 20:24.500
- Babylon 5.
- Babylon 5, you say?

20:26.542 --> 20:28.458
Oh, my God.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.667
What.. What year is it?

20:31.750 --> 20:33.708
It's 2258.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.958
Then it's true.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.083
We have to hurry!

20:41.167 --> 20:44.125
We have to get everyone
off the station quickly before..

20:44.208 --> 20:46.000
[rumbling]

20:46.083 --> 20:48.167
What the hell?

20:52.375 --> 20:53.958
(Garibaldi)
'Commander!'

20:54.917 --> 20:56.083
Commander!

20:56.167 --> 20:58.208
[zapping]

21:02.083 --> 21:03.417
They went thorough
level seven and eight

21:03.500 --> 21:05.167
can't stop them!
They're everywhere!

21:05.250 --> 21:06.333
Garibaldi?

21:06.417 --> 21:07.833
Look, I've rigged
the fusion reactors!

21:07.917 --> 21:09.167
But there's no time! Get going!

21:09.250 --> 21:11.167
I'll hold 'em as long as I can.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.000
Look, come on,
this isn't a conversation!

21:15.083 --> 21:17.958
Jeff, it's okay,
I finally understand!

21:18.042 --> 21:19.917
This is the moment
I was born for!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.875
Now go! Go!

21:22.875 --> 21:25.083
- Go!
- Wait! Wait!

21:25.167 --> 21:27.083
(Garibaldi)
'They're coming through.'

21:28.083 --> 21:29.708
[zapping]

21:29.792 --> 21:32.000
Take that! Take it,
how about you? How about you?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.042
Take some! Take some! Take some!

21:34.125 --> 21:35.708
Wait!

21:35.792 --> 21:37.500
Garibaldi!

21:39.958 --> 21:41.917
What!? What was that?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.708
It's different for everyone.
A flash!

21:45.792 --> 21:48.458
Forward or backward!

21:48.542 --> 21:51.042
All of us, the entire station!

21:51.125 --> 21:54.042
We've become unstuck in time,
commander.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.708
That's why we have
to get out of here quickly!

21:58.833 --> 22:00.875
[whizzing]

22:03.792 --> 22:06.000
[instrumental music]

22:06.083 --> 22:08.833
(Grey Council #1)
They are waiting for you
in the Great Hall.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.417
I know.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.125
They cannot begin without you.

22:14.208 --> 22:18.417
If I enter the Great Hall,
I will never leave it again.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.625
I will live out my days
and my nights in that place.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.333
Yes.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.583
It is a great honor.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.417
I cannot do it.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.083
I cannot accept the calling.

22:31.167 --> 22:35.250
In over 1000 years,
no one has refused.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.542
Then perhaps it is time!

22:39.833 --> 22:41.917
I hear their calling.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.417
I know the reasons for it,
and part of me yearns to accept!

22:46.500 --> 22:49.708
But I must listen to the greater
calling of my heart.

22:49.792 --> 22:52.000
And what does your heart
tell you?

22:52.083 --> 22:54.000
That I must stay where I am.

22:55.042 --> 22:58.417
That I must remain
with Babylon 5.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.792
That I have a part to play
in the change that is coming.

23:01.875 --> 23:06.333
They will say it is just
the voice of ego and of pride.

23:06.417 --> 23:08.667
Perhaps.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.792
I wish to reconvene the council.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.458
- I must speak to them.
- That has never been done!

23:16.250 --> 23:20.458
But if it were to be done
at all

23:20.542 --> 23:24.375
this is as good
and as bad a time as any.

23:25.292 --> 23:26.458
Do you know what you're doing?

23:26.542 --> 23:29.875
Are you fully aware
of the consequences?

23:29.958 --> 23:32.625
Yes, I am.

23:35.083 --> 23:38.250
Then I will call
the Grey Council together.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.958
(female #1)
'We've reestablished
communications '

23:43.042 --> 23:44.292
'with the shuttle escort.'

23:44.375 --> 23:45.833
The first group
is being evacuated.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.042
- What about the commander?
- 'He's still aboard.'

23:48.125 --> 23:49.792
(male #2)
'Babylon Control
this is Shuttle Wing Two'

23:49.875 --> 23:51.333
'requesting permission
to launch.'

23:51.417 --> 23:54.083
Shuttle Escort Wing number Two.
You're clear for launch.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.042
[whizzing]

23:57.542 --> 24:01.083
It started 24 hours after
the station went operational.

24:01.167 --> 24:03.750
We began noticing discrepancies
in the time track system.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.042
We thought it was
a computer glitch

24:05.125 --> 24:06.667
then all hell broke loose.

24:06.750 --> 24:09.833
Anything else unusual happened
before the station vanished?

24:09.917 --> 24:12.292
Yeah, this.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.333
Says his name's Zathras.

24:17.417 --> 24:18.667
We don't know how he got aboard

24:18.750 --> 24:20.458
'where he came from
or what race he is.'

24:20.542 --> 24:23.333
'I've never seen an alien
like him before.'

24:25.167 --> 24:26.458
[gasps]

24:29.333 --> 24:30.792
Ah!

24:31.417 --> 24:32.875
Oh!

24:32.958 --> 24:35.208
Not the One. No.

24:35.292 --> 24:37.542
- Not the one what?
- Not the one.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.667
Won't talk. Can't talk.
Not the One!

24:40.750 --> 24:44.333
They told me. They did.
Zathras listens, he does, yes.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.250
Zathras listens
and does what he's told.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.208
He keeps talking like that
since we caught him.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.875
- Where'd you find him?
- That's the weird part.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.708
One minute, we're alone
in the conference room.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.042
The next...there's a flash,
and there he is.

24:56.125 --> 25:00.333
The One is hurt. Must find.
Zathras must find. Help.

25:00.417 --> 25:03.208
- What're you doing here?
- 'Need this place.'

25:03.292 --> 25:05.958
Need this. Used to fight.

25:06.042 --> 25:10.625
They told Zathras, "Biggest of
all Babylon Stations, we need."

25:10.708 --> 25:12.958
Needing, we take.

25:13.958 --> 25:15.292
There is no more to telling.

25:15.375 --> 25:17.500
Why do you need Babylon 4?

25:19.792 --> 25:23.250
Zathras tells,
you let Zathras go?

25:23.333 --> 25:24.833
Finish what Zathras came for?

25:24.917 --> 25:26.583
Zathras tells,
maybe we don't break

25:26.667 --> 25:28.833
Zathras' scrawny little neck!

25:28.917 --> 25:29.750
Ooh!

25:29.833 --> 25:31.833
[clicking tongue]

25:36.167 --> 25:37.750
Great War.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.500
Terrible war.

25:40.583 --> 25:44.917
There is much killings.
Everyone fighting.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.250
A great darkness.

25:48.333 --> 25:51.292
It is the end of everything.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.000
Zathras warn, but..

25:55.083 --> 25:58.750
...ah, no, no one listen
to poor Zathras. No.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.958
'Great War..'

26:02.042 --> 26:05.917
...but great hope of peace.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.167
Need place.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.208
'Place to gather'

26:11.292 --> 26:13.125
'to fight, to organize.'

26:13.208 --> 26:16.083
You need Babylon 4 as a base
of operations in a war?

26:16.167 --> 26:17.542
Is that it?

26:17.625 --> 26:19.750
[clicking tongue]

26:19.833 --> 26:22.458
To help save galaxy..

26:22.542 --> 26:24.917
...on the side of light.

26:25.708 --> 26:27.750
So they tell me..

26:27.833 --> 26:31.833
...must have,
or it is the end of all.

26:34.250 --> 26:36.708
The One leads us.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.417
The One tells us to go.
We go.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.292
We live for the One.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.792
We would die for the One.

26:50.958 --> 26:54.667
We pull this place through
time..

26:54.750 --> 26:56.333
...to save us all.

26:56.417 --> 26:59.958
Pull through time to where?
The past? The future?

27:00.042 --> 27:01.542
Where you come from,
what year is it?

27:01.625 --> 27:03.500
By my world time

27:03.583 --> 27:05.792
it is year 4993.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.417
But what is that in Earth time?

27:07.500 --> 27:08.750
If we don't know
where you come from

27:08.833 --> 27:12.458
that date doesn't do us
any good!

27:12.542 --> 27:17.250
Much apologizing.
Mathematics not Zathras' skill.

27:17.333 --> 27:20.083
- 'Zathras go now.'
- Major, it's back!

27:20.167 --> 27:23.208
[dramatic music]

27:27.125 --> 27:29.000
- Let's get him!
- Hey!

27:30.417 --> 27:32.042
There it is again!

27:32.125 --> 27:33.958
(Sinclair)
'What the hell?'

27:34.833 --> 27:36.875
[gasping]

27:47.542 --> 27:49.292
It is the One.

27:53.333 --> 27:56.417
[music continues]

27:59.292 --> 28:02.292
[instrumental music]

28:04.083 --> 28:06.792
He's in pain.

28:06.875 --> 28:09.750
Yes. Much pain.

28:09.833 --> 28:12.750
- 'Oh!'
- Warned him. Zathras did.

28:12.833 --> 28:16.750
But willing to sacrifice himself
for others.

28:16.833 --> 28:19.958
He stopped the time-taking..

28:20.042 --> 28:23.083
...to let these escape station.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.583
You're saying he deliberately
stopped Babylon 4

28:25.667 --> 28:27.750
to let the crew get off?

28:29.958 --> 28:32.917
[dramatic music]

28:33.000 --> 28:34.708
Commander, don't.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.208
[grunting]

28:57.417 --> 28:59.792
Fixed. Zathras fixed!

28:59.875 --> 29:01.958
Take! Hurry!

29:05.208 --> 29:06.792
Stop him!

29:06.875 --> 29:09.792
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

29:11.167 --> 29:14.250
[intense music]

29:17.792 --> 29:19.458
Alright! There he is!

29:20.542 --> 29:22.542
[grunting]

29:23.958 --> 29:26.500
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.750
[whirring]

29:28.833 --> 29:30.458
You must leave now.

29:30.542 --> 29:34.250
Finished we are.
There is no more time.

29:34.333 --> 29:37.500
'Leave!
Or be trapped here forever!'

29:37.583 --> 29:38.583
Better help with evacuations.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.167
Alright, I'll link in.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.875
Come on, bring him!

29:46.583 --> 29:50.167
(Grey Council #2)
'You wish to speak to me?
Now is your time.'

29:51.792 --> 29:53.583
This council stopped the war

29:53.667 --> 29:56.375
against the humans
because of prophecy.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.875
Because Valen said
that the humans

29:58.958 --> 30:01.083
some among them had a destiny

30:01.167 --> 30:04.292
which we could not
interfere with.

30:04.375 --> 30:06.667
It was my place to study them

30:06.750 --> 30:10.417
to determine if the prophecy
was correct.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.708
I have not yet
finished that task.

30:13.792 --> 30:16.542
How much more is there
to learn, Delenn?

30:16.625 --> 30:18.583
They are a primitive people.

30:18.667 --> 30:22.125
I doubt the prophecy.
It may have referred to others.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.583
- It did not!
- How do you know?

30:25.667 --> 30:27.917
What is it that makes
the humans so special?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.625
What is it that draws you
to them?

30:30.708 --> 30:32.208
They fight. They argue.

30:32.292 --> 30:35.375
They are ruled
by passions and fears.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.708
Yes, and that is their strength.

30:39.792 --> 30:43.708
They do not seek conformity.
They do not surrender.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.917
Out of their differences
comes symmetry

30:46.000 --> 30:49.708
their unique capacity to fight
against impossible odds.

30:49.792 --> 30:53.417
Hurt them, and they only
come back stronger.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.375
The passions we deplore
have taken them

30:56.458 --> 30:58.083
to their place in the stars

30:58.167 --> 31:01.542
and will propel them
to a great destiny.

31:01.625 --> 31:04.375
Their only weakness is that
they do not recognize

31:04.458 --> 31:05.917
their own greatness.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
They forget that they have come
to this place

31:08.083 --> 31:10.333
through two million years
of evolution

31:10.417 --> 31:12.250
struggle and blood.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.750
They are better than they think

31:14.833 --> 31:17.958
and nobler than they know.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.792
They carry within them
the capacity

31:19.875 --> 31:24.208
to walk among the stars
like giants.

31:24.292 --> 31:26.333
They are the future

31:26.417 --> 31:28.917
and we have much
to learn from them.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.458
But why you?

31:31.542 --> 31:33.500
Why not another?

31:33.583 --> 31:37.917
It is my calling.
The calling of my heart.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.083
No ruling of this council
can override that call.

31:41.167 --> 31:45.958
Delenn, if you reject
this decision

31:46.042 --> 31:47.792
if you turn away from the honor

31:47.875 --> 31:51.292
this council has chosen
to give..

31:51.375 --> 31:52.625
...if you leave us again

31:52.708 --> 31:55.375
you may not be allowed
to return again.

31:55.458 --> 31:58.083
You may lose your position
within the council.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.667
Is this truly what you want?

32:00.750 --> 32:03.125
Think hard, Delenn.

32:03.208 --> 32:06.708
This council has never before
been divided.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.250
We may best avoid division

32:08.333 --> 32:11.375
by removing you
from our company.

32:11.458 --> 32:14.292
'You could become outcast.'

32:15.167 --> 32:16.958
I understand.

32:18.750 --> 32:22.125
But I must do
what I believe is right.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.375
Then we shall put it to a vote.

32:25.875 --> 32:29.500
Who among us will honor
Delenn's request?

32:31.500 --> 32:34.583
[instrumental music]

32:38.333 --> 32:41.250
This council has spoken.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.083
We withdraw our decision.

32:43.167 --> 32:45.625
Another will be chosen
to lead us.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.125
Go now..

32:49.208 --> 32:52.458
'...so that we may reflect
on our choices..'

32:52.542 --> 32:55.625
'...and debate what is to become
of your position.'

33:02.083 --> 33:04.125
[clamoring]

33:06.583 --> 33:09.292
Alright, don't panic!
Everybody just calm down.

33:09.375 --> 33:10.667
We'll clear you all out
just as soon

33:10.750 --> 33:12.250
as we can load you
into the shuttles!

33:12.333 --> 33:14.625
Hey! Hey, come on,
watch the shoving.

33:14.708 --> 33:17.375
Okay, let's go.
Five! Just five.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.917
[clamoring]

33:19.000 --> 33:22.500
One, two, three, four, five.
Let's go. Hold it!

33:22.583 --> 33:24.667
Close 'em up! Close 'em up!

33:24.750 --> 33:27.417
- Let someone out!
- Okay, five more.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.917
Let's go.
One, two, three, four, five.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.958
Okay, that's good, that's good.
Wait up, Wait up.

33:33.042 --> 33:35.583
Everybody, just relax!
Just relax!

33:35.667 --> 33:37.833
[instrumental music]

33:37.917 --> 33:40.708
(Krantz)
'What was that device
you handed over?'

33:40.792 --> 33:42.792
(Zathras)
Time stabilizer.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.958
Help survive
when make next time jump.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.917
That must've been what happened
to our pilot.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.750
He was caught up in the time
distortion and was killed by it.

33:50.833 --> 33:52.333
Yes.

33:52.417 --> 33:55.417
- Where is your stabilizer?
- Gone.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.375
Gave it to the One.
Now I have none.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.792
So without this time stabilizer

34:01.875 --> 34:04.583
what happens to you
when it jumps?

34:04.667 --> 34:06.292
Zathras die.

34:06.375 --> 34:10.000
But Zathras die for cause.

34:10.083 --> 34:13.042
Maybe stop Great War.

34:13.125 --> 34:17.625
Maybe Zathras great hero.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.208
Maybe build statue to Zathras,
and others come..

34:19.292 --> 34:20.625
...remember Zathras.

34:20.708 --> 34:23.875
What if we take you with us,
put you on trial?

34:23.958 --> 34:28.958
Zathras not of this time.
You take, Zathras die.

34:29.042 --> 34:31.667
You leave, Zathras die.

34:31.750 --> 34:34.458
Either way,
it is bad for Zathras.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.875
If you'll just tell us
how to stop this!

34:36.958 --> 34:38.042
No, no.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.042
You're willing
to let yourself die

34:40.125 --> 34:42.167
to steal a space station?

34:42.250 --> 34:44.583
Zathras does not want to die..

34:44.667 --> 34:47.708
...but if it is the only way,
then Zathras dies.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.167
It is life.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.292
[rumbling]

34:57.625 --> 34:59.208
- Sinclair.
- Just got the message.

34:59.292 --> 35:00.792
Tachyon emissions are way up!

35:00.875 --> 35:02.708
This place is starting to go
where the hell it's going.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.375
- What about the evacuation?
- One more pass.

35:04.458 --> 35:05.750
We'll have everybody
off this station

35:05.833 --> 35:07.167
except you and the command
staff.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.667
If you're coming,
you better do it now.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.375
This place is falling apart,
faster than..

35:13.708 --> 35:16.375
(Lise)
'So this is it.'

35:16.458 --> 35:18.250
'You're just gonna leave?'

35:19.583 --> 35:21.542
Lise?

35:21.625 --> 35:24.167
I don't understand you, Michael.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.000
We've got a good life here,
we've got history.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.042
You've met this Sinclair
character twice

35:29.125 --> 35:32.625
and now you're off
to Babylon 5, just like that?

35:32.708 --> 35:34.583
Don't I mean anything to you?

35:34.667 --> 35:38.208
Lise, my God,
what-what are you doing here?

35:38.292 --> 35:40.333
I don't know.

35:40.417 --> 35:43.167
I'm starting to wonder
the same thing myself.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.875
I think you've got
something to prove

35:44.958 --> 35:47.583
that somehow,
maybe taking this job

35:47.667 --> 35:50.208
will mean the last five years
didn't happen.

35:50.292 --> 35:52.750
But I'm part of those years,
Michael

35:52.833 --> 35:55.333
and I will not go to Babylon 5
with you.

35:55.417 --> 35:58.208
It's gotta be one or the other.

35:58.292 --> 36:00.833
When you make up your mind

36:00.917 --> 36:02.875
you know where to find me.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.208
Oh, Lise. Wait, no!

36:05.292 --> 36:07.542
You gotta listen to me.
Please, don't leave me again.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.292
We can work this out, I..

36:11.417 --> 36:14.208
Lise? Lise?

36:14.292 --> 36:17.083
- Lis..
- Garibaldi?

36:17.167 --> 36:19.125
Garibaldi, are you okay?

36:20.625 --> 36:23.000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.667
Get on down here, Jeff, I want
to get the hell off this place!

36:25.750 --> 36:28.583
He's right! The time distortion
is getting worse.

36:28.667 --> 36:29.958
We must leave now!

36:30.042 --> 36:32.417
- I agree, but, what about him?
- We take him with us!

36:32.500 --> 36:33.792
He said he'd die if we did that.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.000
And you believe him?

36:36.083 --> 36:39.083
I don't know. But it's clear
that he believes it.

36:39.167 --> 36:41.000
Commander,
for the next 15 minutes

36:41.083 --> 36:42.417
this is still my command.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.250
I'm going to have to answer
for this station

36:45.333 --> 36:46.917
and I want proof to go with it!

36:47.000 --> 36:50.500
Alive or dead,
he's the only proof I've got!

36:51.542 --> 36:54.250
And he's going with us!
Take him!

36:54.333 --> 36:57.375
[intense music]

37:04.542 --> 37:06.542
[rumbling]

37:19.625 --> 37:21.667
[grunting]

37:23.625 --> 37:24.875
- We've got to help him!
- Too late!

37:24.958 --> 37:26.125
We gotta get outta here.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.292
We can't just leave him!

37:27.375 --> 37:28.792
You think I want to?

37:28.875 --> 37:32.083
We have to leave now,
with or without you!

37:32.167 --> 37:34.792
- Come on.
- Go! Leave me!

37:34.875 --> 37:36.292
I can't.

37:36.375 --> 37:40.458
Go! You must listen to Zathras!

37:40.542 --> 37:43.750
You have a destiny.

37:44.583 --> 37:47.833
Go! Please!

37:47.917 --> 37:49.792
Go for Zathras.

37:52.417 --> 37:55.458
[intense music]

37:57.917 --> 37:59.792
[clattering]

37:59.875 --> 38:02.500
What the hell is going on
around here?

38:02.583 --> 38:04.417
Commander, come on!

38:05.750 --> 38:07.667
Come on!

38:07.750 --> 38:09.542
Last shuttle's gone!
It's just us now.

38:09.625 --> 38:12.208
Ship's warmed up
and ready to go! Come on.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.042
It's like watching a great old
ship go down for the last time.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.417
Yeah, well, you're not
the captain of this ship.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.875
And I'm not about to let
you go down with it!

38:17.958 --> 38:20.500
Now, come on! Come on!

38:20.583 --> 38:22.083
Hurry!

38:24.167 --> 38:27.042
[intense music]

38:27.125 --> 38:29.125
[rattling]

38:38.500 --> 38:39.958
[chuckles]

38:43.792 --> 38:45.958
Zathras knew

38:46.042 --> 38:48.000
you would not leave him.

38:49.375 --> 38:52.458
'Zathras trusts the One.'

38:57.000 --> 38:59.708
Distortion field increasing.
It's off the scale.

39:00.583 --> 39:02.083
She's going.

39:03.292 --> 39:05.875
(computer)
'Time distortion repaired.'

39:05.958 --> 39:09.375
'Present-time atmosphere
now breathable.'

39:16.500 --> 39:19.833
I tried. I tried to warn them.

39:21.042 --> 39:22.875
But it all happened

39:22.958 --> 39:25.167
just the way I remembered.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.083
I know.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.583
It's time. We have to go.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.583
They're waiting for us.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.375
Do you think that bit was true?

39:50.458 --> 39:52.792
About a Great War
and Babylon 4 being the base

39:52.875 --> 39:55.458
for somebody to try and bring
peace to the galaxy?

39:55.542 --> 39:58.250
I don't know.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.583
But if it is true,
I wish them luck.

40:00.667 --> 40:03.792
The station was built
to create peace.

40:03.875 --> 40:07.208
Maybe now it'll do so
in a way nobody ever expected.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.542
But it's still
on the same mission.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.750
Maximum burn.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
[whizzing]

40:27.208 --> 40:28.250
[instrumental music]
