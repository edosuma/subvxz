[Doc reading]

00:59.642 --> 01:02.187
Adventure Girl,
you rescue Froggy.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.730
I'll capture
the bad fairy.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.608
You can't get me.

01:06.941 --> 01:07.942
[giggles]

01:08.818 --> 01:10.487
[both laugh]

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
[giggles]

01:14.240 --> 01:17.494
Where could the bad fairy
be hiding?

01:17.577 --> 01:20.663
I have no idea.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.042
[squeals]
I found you!

01:24.125 --> 01:25.627
[all laughing]

01:26.169 --> 01:27.378
Look!

01:27.462 --> 01:28.713
It stopped raining.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.174
The sun's out!

01:31.257 --> 01:32.467
Let's go out!

01:35.345 --> 01:38.807
Mom! We're going out to see
if there are puddles to stomp!

01:41.893 --> 01:43.520
Look! There's one!

01:44.229 --> 01:45.939
Moo Moo.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.690
No!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.819
[Emmie] I guess someone left
Moo Moo out in the rain.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.237
It was me.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.907
I forgot her,
and now she's ruined.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.951
[sniffles]
Don't cry, Alma.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.537
Moo Moo just needs
to see a doctor
for toys,

02:00.620 --> 02:03.540
and you're in luck,
'cause that's me.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.667
[sniffles]
But she's all wet.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.627
I'll get her dry.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.422
But she'll have to
come with me to the
clinic for a while, okay?

02:12.006 --> 02:13.216
Okay.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.345
[kisses]
Bye, Moo Moo,
and... I'm sorry.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.224
It's okay.
Doc McStuffins
is on the case.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.896
[Alma] Bye, Moo Moo.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.442
The Doc is in.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.533
[both laugh]

02:39.993 --> 02:42.120
[all] Hi, Doc.
Hey, everybody.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.164
Say hello to our
new patient, Moo Moo.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.166
Hi, Moo Moo!
Welcome, Sugar.

02:46.249 --> 02:50.044
Oh. Hello.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.381
Why, Moo Moo, you're as wet
as a weasel in a waterfall.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.091
Whoa!

02:55.174 --> 02:57.176
I'll say!
What happened?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.137
Oh, me. Oh, my.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.763
Oh, Moo!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.891
Alma left me in
the pouring rain,

03:02.974 --> 03:06.019
and now, well,
I'm soaked through.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.730
You are lucky, Moo Moo.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.857
If anyone left me
out in the rain,

03:10.940 --> 03:12.567
I'd be nothing but a puddle.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.403
Chilly! You're not
made out of snow,

03:15.486 --> 03:17.280
so you can't turn
into a puddle.

03:17.947 --> 03:18.990
Wait a minute.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.659
That does ring a bell.
[laughs]. Thanks, Doc.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.077
I'd give you
a cuddle,

03:23.161 --> 03:25.622
but stuffed animals
shouldn't get wet.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.042
Lambie's right. That's why
we need to get Moo Moo dry.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.587
Now where did
I put those towels?

03:34.672 --> 03:35.757
Oh! [laughs]!

03:35.840 --> 03:37.383
Towels!
Coming right up!

03:37.467 --> 03:39.385
Whoa!

03:39.469 --> 03:40.511
[grunts]

03:40.595 --> 03:41.888
[chuckles]
Puddle.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.431
Thanks, Stuffy.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.601
You'll be staying with us while
you dry out, Moo Moo.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.312
That means I'll need
to check you in.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.777
Ohh. Ohh.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.779
What's the matter,
Hon?

03:58.863 --> 03:59.948
[blows nose]

04:00.031 --> 04:05.078
Ohh. It's just I thought
Alma was my true friend.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.623
And then off she goes,
leaving me in the rain.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.875
She is your friend, Moo Moo.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.002
But everyone
makes mistakes,

04:13.086 --> 04:14.629
even our friends.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.091
The most important thing now
is to get you dry.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.761
Hallie, please clear my
schedule for the day.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.014
We have to get all this
water out of Moo Moo, stat.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.141
That means right now.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.643
You got it, Doc.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.815
Moo Moo, I have
a diagnosis.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.400
You have Squishy-itis.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.026
Ooh!

04:37.110 --> 04:39.904
Now that's sure
a fancy-pants-sounding
problem.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.116
Fancy enough for
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

04:45.994 --> 04:47.453
The first thing
we need to do

04:47.537 --> 04:50.248
is squeeze all that
water out of you.

04:50.331 --> 04:54.585
Oh, me. Oh, Moo.
Oh, my.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.170
Are you sure?

04:56.254 --> 04:57.463
Don't worry.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.633
It might tickle,
but it won't hurt a bit.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.677
Stuffy, you take her legs.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.140
Lambie, you can
squeeze her tail.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.349
Okay, Doc.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.145
-Ready?
-Ready.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.479
Hold on, Doc.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.734
On the count of three,
we twist and squeeze.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.695
One, two, three!

05:20.778 --> 05:23.364
[Moo Moo] Oooohhh!

05:25.199 --> 05:27.618
Oh, gosh! That does
tickle. [laughs]!

05:27.702 --> 05:30.246
That ought to do it.
You can let go now.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.372
Okay.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.749
Whoa! Whoa!

05:32.832 --> 05:34.459
Aah! [grunts]

05:34.542 --> 05:36.586
Ugh. [laughs]!

05:37.712 --> 05:39.881
Are you all right?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.509
Oh, yeah.
I meant to do that.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.055
A-ha! Caught you smiling.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.891
Well, sure.
I kinda like it here.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.268
Now that we have
most of the water out,

05:52.351 --> 05:54.479
it's time to roll and press.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.231
First, we roll you up.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.193
Then to really get
the water out,

06:00.276 --> 06:01.819
we need to press.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.531
Lambie, I think a few
<span style="style.default_1">grand jetés</span> would be just fine.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.827
-Weee! Weee!
-[Moo Moo giggling]

06:09.911 --> 06:13.289
Oh, my!
You're a good dancer.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.000
Move a little to
the left, please.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.300
And this is how
the dragon does it.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.760
[grunting]

06:26.594 --> 06:27.804
Ooh!

06:28.221 --> 06:29.514
That's the spot.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.599
There's one more part
of your treatment

06:31.682 --> 06:34.477
to get you extra
super-duper dry.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.649
Nothing like sunshine
to dry up the last bit of water

06:39.732 --> 06:40.858
left in your fur.

06:41.901 --> 06:47.740
Ah. A cow could get
used to this.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.034
The last time I had
this much fun

06:50.118 --> 06:53.287
was when Alma took me
to schooool.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.833
Of course that was
before she left me
out in the rain,

06:56.916 --> 07:00.253
and I got mad at her.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.922
I know that made you
feel bad, Moo Moo,

07:03.005 --> 07:06.342
but Alma really didn't
do it on purpose.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.970
Maybe you're right.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.430
Of course I am.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.473
And now that you're done
with your treatment,

07:12.557 --> 07:14.725
I just need to give you
a final checkup

07:14.809 --> 07:16.269
to make sure
you're all better.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.896
Hallie, I need my--
Doctor's bag.

an amazing recovery.

You're dry and fluffy again
and ready to be discharged.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.728
That means you can
go back home.

07:58.811 --> 08:04.484
[gasps] you mean I have to
moooove back to Alma's house?

08:04.567 --> 08:07.820
Yep. I'm officially giving you
a clean bill of health.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.072
Hooray! You're all better!

Huh?

08:12.867 --> 08:16.120
Well, aren't you excited
to go home, Moo Moo?

08:16.204 --> 08:19.373
No. The truth is
I don't want to go.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.126
You don't want to go home?

08:22.543 --> 08:23.377
Why?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.379
Well, I'm having
so much fun here

08:25.463 --> 08:27.840
with all my
new friends,

08:27.924 --> 08:31.969
and you've taken such
good care of me.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.722
But Alma will be
so sad without you.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.433
Nope. I'm putting
my hoof down.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.520
I'm not going home!

08:41.812 --> 08:45.233
Moo Moo, just because Alma
left you out in the rain

08:45.316 --> 08:47.193
doesn't mean
she doesn't love you.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.862
Everyone makes mistakes
sometimes.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.239

08:52.698 --> 08:54.825
[gasps] Oopsy.

My mistake.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.457

09:03.209 --> 09:05.962
Hey, Doc, remember
when you accidently

09:06.045 --> 09:07.547
put me in
the laundry basket,

09:07.630 --> 09:09.674
and I went through
the washing machine?

09:09.757 --> 09:11.717
[gasps]
You did that?

09:11.801 --> 09:14.595
I did. I was helping Mom
on laundry day

09:14.679 --> 09:17.390
and forgot to check
the sheets for toys.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.891
Big mistake.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.645
But I came out
extra fluffy. [giggles]

09:22.728 --> 09:24.605
[squeaks]

09:26.315 --> 09:27.775
Yep, it's true.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.987
One time, I forgot
Squeakers was on
the water table,

09:31.070 --> 09:32.989
and it got really cold,

09:33.072 --> 09:34.782
and he froze.

He was a fish cube
all right.

[girl crying]

10:30.671 --> 10:32.381
That sounds like Alma.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.765
And when I had
a bad fever,

10:41.223 --> 10:44.101
Moo Moo stayed with me
the whole time.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.228
And remember how she
came with me

10:46.312 --> 10:48.064
on my first day
of school?

10:49.023 --> 10:51.609
Oh, Moo Moo's just
gotta be okay.

10:51.692 --> 10:52.568
[weeps]

10:52.652 --> 10:54.779
Oh, my.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.114
Those were good times.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.076
Alma's always been
a true friend,

11:00.493 --> 11:04.413
and I'm sure she didn't
mean to leave me outside.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.792
So maybe you can forgive her?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.670
Oh, you betcha I can.

11:11.045 --> 11:14.465
Sorry, Doc, but I gotta
move on out.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.800
Nothing personal.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.677
It's just my home
is with Alma.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.222
Everyone makes mistakes
sometimes, you know?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.516
Even best friends.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.975
It's okay, Moo Moo.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.062
We'll miss you,
but I totally understand.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.731
Come back and visit, okay?
Stay dry.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.526
I'll miss you, too.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.570
[giggles]
Group cuddle.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.616
Excuse me.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.077
Is anyone missing
a stuffed cow?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.286
[gasps]

11:44.370 --> 11:45.454
Moo Moo?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.082
She's dry!

11:48.165 --> 11:49.834
You fixed her, Doc.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.961
Yep, that's what I do.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.546
[thunder]
Uh-oh.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.006
Looks like it might
rain again.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.385
No getting wet
for you, Moo Moo.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.636

12:01.595 --> 12:02.596

12:03.556 --> 12:04.765

-[laughing]

12:09.520 --> 12:11.439
-Bye, Doc.
-Bye.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.570
[Doc reading]

12:18.571 --> 12:22.658
World famous soccer star, Emmie,
lines up for a kick.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.868
She shoots.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.578
She scores!

12:25.661 --> 12:26.871
-Yay!
-Whoo-hoo!

12:26.954 --> 12:28.247
Yay, Emmie!

12:30.708 --> 12:33.252
The ball felt a little
squishy when I kicked it.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.796
Really?
Let me try.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.176
Soccer superstar,
Doc McStuffins,

12:40.259 --> 12:42.720
is ready to tie the game
with her kick.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.972
She takes the shot...

12:47.975 --> 12:49.560
and she scores!

12:49.643 --> 12:50.811
Yay! Whoo!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.189
Way to go, Doc!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.775
Um, hello?

12:56.859 --> 13:00.196
You scored a goal.
Weren't you happy?

13:00.863 --> 13:03.032
Yeah, but you're right.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.075
Something's wrong
with your ball.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.829
Yeah, but, Doc,
we can't stop now.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.874
The next kick is for
the world championship.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.419
The world championship
is on the line.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.881
Emmie, the best player
in the universe, steps up.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.716
Nothing can stop her.

13:21.717 --> 13:22.968
The kick is away!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.720
[Emmie] And it's
headed for the goal.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.846
Aww.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.098
But it doesn't
make it in.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.684
Oh. I can't believe it.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.147
How can we win the championship
with a flat ball?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.316
Well, you know,

13:37.608 --> 13:42.112
one of your best friends
is really, really good
at fixing toys.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.615
Oh, yeah!
That's you, Doc.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.743
Duh. You're the best
toy fixer there is.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.579
You think you can
fix it, right?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.082
Yep. I'm pretty sure
I can.

13:53.165 --> 13:53.999
Great!

13:54.083 --> 13:55.334
I'm gonna get a banana

13:55.417 --> 13:57.127
to fuel up
while you fix it.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.921
And when you get back,

13:59.004 --> 14:02.633
we can finish the soccer
world championship.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.634
Right.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.762
Mom, can I have a banana?

14:06.845 --> 14:07.930
Sure, sweetie.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.056
See you later, Doc.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.188
The Doc is in.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.486
-Hiya, Doc.
-Oh, hi there.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.446
What's up, Doc?
Hiya, guys

14:24.530 --> 14:26.824
Well, you're looking
full of energy today.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.118
That's 'cause I was just
playing soccer.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.079
Exercise gets you feeling
all pumped up.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.332
I just wish I could say
the same for our patient.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.251
You guys remember
Emmie's ball, Boomer?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.502
Oh, yeah!

14:40.045 --> 14:42.172
You're the best bouncing
ball I've ever seen.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.050
I love to bounce!

14:45.134 --> 14:48.387
But I'm not feeling
so good today.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.934
Is that what a bounce is
supposed to sound like?

14:56.478 --> 14:59.231
I tell you, when I hit
the ground just right,

14:59.315 --> 15:02.484
it-- boing! I bounce
back up into the air!

15:02.860 --> 15:05.195
Oh, it's the sweetest
sound ever!

15:05.279 --> 15:07.448
But that didn't sound sweet.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.618
Wow. It's like if
I couldn't roar.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.244
Or I couldn't baa.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.413
Or I couldn't
melt.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.958
Chilly, you can't--
Oh, never mind.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.544
But I don't get it, Doc.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.588
Why can't I bounce?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.715
I'm not totally sure,

15:24.965 --> 15:28.260
but I think you might
be a little... flat.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.554
So, why don't we give you
a checkup

15:30.638 --> 15:32.139
so we can see
what's happening?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.057
A checkup?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.434
Uh, you know, now
that I think about it,

15:35.517 --> 15:37.561
uh, it's, uh...
It's no biggie.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.980
I don't need to bounce.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.191
You're not scared, are you?

15:43.150 --> 15:45.486
Um, nope.
No way.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.071
I don't get
scared.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.614
Never been scared
in my life.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.407
[whimpering]
Totally not scared.

15:50.991 --> 15:54.161
So, you'll let me
give you a checkup?

15:54.703 --> 15:55.537
I guess so.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.247
Let's see.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.874
[heart beating]

15:58.958 --> 16:00.626
Your heart sounds okay.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.379
Can you stick out your tongue
and say "ahh" for me?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.297
Ahh.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.633
Your throat looks fine, too.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.468
Hallie, I need--
No, you don't need that.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.639
...the cuff to check
Boomer's pressure.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.349
Whew.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.059
Oh, yeah, that.
[laughs].

16:17.142 --> 16:18.477
Yeah, go for it.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.272
Hmm.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.319
Boomer, you're pressure's
way, way, way down.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.696
No way!

16:29.113 --> 16:30.489
Way, way.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.870
I think that clinches it.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.248
Hallie, I have a diagnosis.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.459
Well, then this hippo
best fetch

16:42.543 --> 16:44.545
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

16:46.338 --> 16:50.175
Boomer, you have a severe case
of deflate-ulosis.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.137
It's caused by
this little leak.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.138
[hissing]

16:54.221 --> 16:56.140
Oh, no.
Are you sure?

16:56.473 --> 16:59.184
Deflate-ulosis?
What's that?

16:59.601 --> 17:03.022
Well, everyone has things
that belong on their insides.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.025
Stuffy, Lambie, and Chilly
have stuffing.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.194
What? I have-- [gulp]
stuffing?

17:09.611 --> 17:10.695
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

17:10.779 --> 17:13.406
Get that stuffing
out of me!
Get it out of me!

17:13.490 --> 17:16.702
Chilly, you're
supposed to have
stuffing.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.288
You're a stuffed
toy, remember?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.832
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]. Okay, never mind.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.792
But, Boomer,
you're a bouncy ball,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.753
and for you
to bounce right,

17:26.837 --> 17:28.589
you need to be
full of air.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.925
Great! Thanks for
the diagnosis.
See ya.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.638
Don't you wanna cure
your Deflate-ulosis?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.891
Oh, yeah. Sure.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.684
Do I need to rest?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.478
Or eat chicken soup?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.271
Or-- or what?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.148
Just tell me
and I'll do it.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.151
The first thing
I need to do is
patch your leak.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.320
Here you go, Doc.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.740
Just what I need,
a patch for bouncy balls.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.993
Just hold still
for a second, Boomer.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.790
There. That should
stop the leak.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.708
Awesome! Thanks, Doc!

18:04.792 --> 18:06.710
Now I'm ready to
go back and play!

18:06.794 --> 18:08.629
Whoa, not yet,
Boomer.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.714
I still have to put
more air back
inside you.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.716
No, that's all right.
I'm good.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.264
Boomer, have you ever been
filled with air before?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.100
Yeah.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.019
And... you know how
I'm going to do it.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
[shudders]
I have a pretty good idea.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.148
[Stuffy] How are you
gonna do it, Doc?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.608
With this air pump.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.236
And it has a needle!

18:33.153 --> 18:36.573
It does, but it's
the only way to
fill you back up.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.701
But why did it have to be
a needle?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.662
Are you scared
of needles?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.039
I am.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.499
[whimpers] Way scared.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.836
The thing is, nothing else
gets me scared,

18:49.128 --> 18:53.048
except for those...
Needles! Oh!

18:54.049 --> 18:57.052
If we don't
fill you with air,
you can't bounce.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.264
You're gonna stay all
flat and squishy.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.598
Oh, no, Doc.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.642
I think I'm feeling
a little flat.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.145
I think I need more air
inside of me, too!

19:06.228 --> 19:09.106
Chilly, you're
a stuffed toy,
not a ball.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.150
Oh, yeah.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.610
I think you might have
mentioned that before.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.530
Okay, Boomer,
now I can just--

19:16.613 --> 19:17.447
[all gasp]

19:18.448 --> 19:20.284
Well, cheese on
a fishstick.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.494
That bouncin' boy
went bye-bye.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.831
Well, he can't bounce far.
We gotta find him.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.963
Boomer? Boomer?

19:33.046 --> 19:34.339
Where are you, Boomer?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.550
Boomer?
Where are you?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.140
I can't find him anywhere.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.605
Boomer, what are you
doing in here?

19:49.897 --> 19:51.815
Um, well, I, uh...

19:52.065 --> 19:54.484
I've been thinking of moving
out of Emmie's toy box.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.987
Uh, so I decided to check out
this doll house.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.989
Look. New floors.
Nice, right?

19:59.072 --> 20:02.326
Boomer, you can't hide
in here forever.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.829
You're gonna have to get
filled up with air
sometime, Sugar.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.040
Yeah, I know.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.001
You wanna know
a secret?

20:11.335 --> 20:12.544
Yeah.
I do.
Yeah.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.296
I don't like needles
either.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.547
You don't?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.299
When I need to get
a shot

20:17.382 --> 20:19.176
with a needle from
my doctor,

20:19.426 --> 20:21.136
I'm always scared.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.722
So, how do you get through it?

20:24.181 --> 20:26.099
Well, my mom comes
with me

20:26.183 --> 20:28.101
and gives me
a big hug.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.895
As long as she's
there,

20:29.978 --> 20:31.897
I feel brave enough
to get the shot.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.941
I like hugs.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.026
And I like giving them.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.487
We could all
give you a hug.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.072

I'm filled up with air!

21:28.370 --> 21:29.579

really, really brave.

-What?

21:58.025 --> 22:00.360
Two more pumps, I think.

I feel way, way
bouncy, Doc!

Thanks for the cuddles.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.392
But could you un-hug me?

It's great
to have you back in
bouncing shape, Boomer.

you were brave?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.219
[chuckles] I sure am!

bouncing way, way, way high!

all better, Boomer.

done with her
banana break.
