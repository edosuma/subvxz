[dramatic music]

00:11.469 --> 00:14.139
[Boz Scaggs' "Lido Shuffle"]

00:14.180 --> 00:15.890
- * Whoa *

00:15.932 --> 00:18.143
- All right.
Looks like we win this round.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.603
- We win this round?
They got the weapon!

00:20.645 --> 00:23.064
- Oh, fine.
Call it a tie.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.483
So, uh, Vick,
why did you sell us out?

00:25.525 --> 00:27.027
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, yeah.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.904
I guess the U.S. military just
kind of happened to show up

00:29.946 --> 00:33.074
at our exact location
on a dog-dang hunch?

00:33.116 --> 00:34.576
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.286
- What exactly
are you accusing me of?

00:36.327 --> 00:37.746
- Oh, come on!

00:37.787 --> 00:40.749
You called your little boy toy
after I specifically made

00:40.790 --> 00:43.418
a no-calling-husbands rule,
and now looked what happened!

00:43.460 --> 00:45.295
- Yeah, we were saved
from death!

00:45.337 --> 00:46.588
- Because of you!

00:46.629 --> 00:48.548
- He probably
just tracked her phone.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.759
- No, that's impossible, Piper.
It's a wireless phone.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.676
- Very funny.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.511
- No, they can
track those too.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.721
- Really?

00:54.763 --> 00:57.432
- Fucking get out of here.
That's very cool.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.309
Well, Vicki,
based on that,

00:59.351 --> 01:01.311
I owe you a huge apology.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.146
And I'd like
to personally apologize

01:03.188 --> 01:05.106
to your phone as well.
May I?

01:05.148 --> 01:07.567
- Oh, thank you.
That's sweet.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.860
[giggles]

01:08.902 --> 01:11.279
- Yeah.
All right.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.740
- [gasps]
MacGruber!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.533
- That ought to slow down
those fucking gomers.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.118
[sirens wailing]
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.453
Piper, down!
- But those are our guys!

01:18.495 --> 01:19.454
- Down, now!
Vicki, quick!

01:19.496 --> 01:20.663
Get your mouth over here!
- What?

01:20.705 --> 01:21.915
- Get your mouth over here!
- Oh.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.876
[sirens wailing]

01:29.005 --> 01:31.049
[sirens fade]

01:31.091 --> 01:33.009
- [sighs]
That was a close one.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.469
Nice undercover work, Vick.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.638
I think they bought it.
- Thank you.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.182
[helicopter whirring]
- Shit, more pigs!

01:39.224 --> 01:40.517
All right,
we better get this bad boy

01:40.558 --> 01:42.560
off the road
and plan our next move.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.523
- You've reached
singer-songwriter

01:46.564 --> 01:48.817
Vicki St. Elmo-Fasoose.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.819
* Leave your name
and your number *

01:50.860 --> 01:55.657
* And a message
after the to-wo-wo-wo-wo... *

01:55.699 --> 01:58.702
- Sir, we have surveillance
photos of the drone strike.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.370
[tense music]

02:00.412 --> 02:01.830
- Jesus, Vicki.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.749
- We also found this.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.752
Ran it through our database.
Says it's Brigadier Commander--

02:07.794 --> 02:09.379
- Enos Queeth.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.464
- You know him, sir?
- Used to.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.633
Till he was killed in action
20 years ago.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.096
Looks pretty good
for a dead guy.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.015
- You think he's behind
MacGruber's kidnapping?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.517
- Makes sense.
The two of them had a history.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.519
I guess Queeth
finally settled the score.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.312
- There's something else
you should see.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.651
- Lieutenant Colonel
Dixon Piper.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.237
- And if you look closely
behind him...

02:35.822 --> 02:36.740
- MacGruber.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.533
[inhales deeply]
I'll be damned.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.618
That son of a bitch
is still alive.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.871
[exhales sharply]
Thank you, Major.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.376
- Jesus, Vicki.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.878
- What have you
gotten yourself into?

02:49.919 --> 02:52.380
- * Wo-one *

02:52.422 --> 02:55.342
* Leave a message
at the tone *

02:55.383 --> 02:57.969
[dial tone beeps]

02:58.011 --> 03:00.221
[dramatic music]

03:00.263 --> 03:07.395
* *

03:20.283 --> 03:24.537
- * MacGruber *

03:24.579 --> 03:27.415
[fire crackles]

03:28.458 --> 03:30.502
[garage door clanging]

03:32.879 --> 03:34.339
[alarm beeping]

03:34.381 --> 03:36.800
- And just like that,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.678
we're ghosts.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.680
- All right. You want to maybe
go take care of that alarm?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.223
- Oh, shit!
Yeah, come on.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.474
Vick, come on!

03:46.976 --> 03:48.269
Okay.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.479
Okay, here we go.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.524
6-9-6-9-6-9.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.442
[alarm chirps]
Shit! Worth a shot.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.903
- 60 seconds, MacGruber.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.531
- All right.
We got this, Vick.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.534
All right,
follow this band to the source.

04:02.575 --> 04:07.997
So, uh,
you, uh, digging the jazz?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.250
- What do you mean?
I don't hear any music.

04:10.291 --> 04:14.045
- [chuckles]
No, this. The jazz.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.797
Fighting the good fight,

04:15.839 --> 04:19.467
getting back in the game
for one last dance.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.845
- I do enjoy
watching you play.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.598
The game. The jazz.
- Yeah.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.100
Got to be honest with you:

04:27.142 --> 04:30.687
been in prison so long,
I'm a little out of practice.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.357
- Excuse me?

04:34.399 --> 04:37.986
- Vicki, do I have
to spell it out for you?

04:38.028 --> 04:41.072
I need to do it with you.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.867
- MacGruber, I'm married.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.369
- [scoffs]
The alarm, Vicki.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.581
[laughs]
The alarm.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.000
All right. Here.
Hand me those wire cutters.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.209
- You got it, MacGruber.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.836
- Now get in there.
- Oh.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.047
- Now let's take
those fingers of yours

04:57.088 --> 05:00.300
and spread those wires apart
very slowly.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.509
- These wires?
- There we go.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.928
Those ones right there.
Great job.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.096
Gently.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.515
There we go.
Attagirl.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.059
Okay, now I'm just
gonna take my tool.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.185
- Yeah?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.519
- I'm just gonna
jam it in there.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.605
I'm just gonna
come inside you there.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.982
Don't worry.
This is gonna be very quick.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.985
I'm almost there already.
I'm about there.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.237
I'm about there!
I'm about to cut it!

05:21.279 --> 05:22.530
I'm about to get it!
- Yes!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.240
- Oh, you know
I'm about to get it!

05:24.282 --> 05:25.825
You see me getting it!
- Yeah!

05:25.867 --> 05:27.786
- You're feeling me getting it!
I'm about to get it!

05:27.827 --> 05:29.287
- Yes!
- I'm about to finish!

05:29.329 --> 05:30.705
- Oh, my God!
- Ah!

05:30.747 --> 05:31.956
[alarm powers down]
- Oh!

05:31.998 --> 05:33.750
- Got it.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.378
Nice work.
- Wow.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.755
Oh, my God. Okay.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.634
- So, MacGruber,
can you please explain

05:42.676 --> 05:44.469
why we're avoiding
telling the U.S. government

05:44.511 --> 05:46.388
that some maniac
just got his hands

05:46.429 --> 05:47.972
on a weapon
of mass destruction?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.725
- Piper, why do you think I hid
that stuff in a fucking cave

05:50.767 --> 05:52.394
for the past 20 years?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.020
For gits and shiggles?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.439
No, I hid it
because no government on Earth

05:56.481 --> 05:59.943
should have it,
not even the USA.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.321
I mean, we're talking about
a world-ender here, Piper.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.783
I don't know about you,
but I kind of like the world.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.160
[sentimental music]

06:09.202 --> 06:11.413
I like sunsets.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.082
I like snowcapped mountains.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.752
I like kicking back with a cold
Molson and watching the game.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.715
I like babies
and kettle corn.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.217
Monster trucks
and puppy dogs.

06:24.259 --> 06:28.513
I like the tig, ol' bitties
and bunchin' mox.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.182
I even like cancer
and type 2 diabetes

06:31.224 --> 06:34.644
because they remind me
that life is precious.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.771
And that is
why it is imperative

06:36.813 --> 06:39.774
that we keep this shit
out of Queeth's hands!

06:39.816 --> 06:43.111
- But you just gave Queeth
the weapon!

06:43.153 --> 06:44.654
- You know what?

06:44.696 --> 06:46.781
I'm gonna start
calling you Checkers,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.575
'cause that's the game
you're playing.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.410
But me?
I play chess.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.995
The thinking man's game.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.747
And if you want
to win at chess,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.832
you got to think
outside the bun

06:55.874 --> 06:57.792
'cause that's how you win
at chess, Checkers.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.711
Checksmate.
We good here?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.588
- No, we're not good here.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.965
We should tell the general
and get his help.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.302
- We don't need his help!
All right?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.387
We can do this ourselves.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.930
I mean, don't you see?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.266
You're not a driving
instructor, Checkers.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.517
[inspirational music]

07:14.559 --> 07:17.979
And, Vicki,
you're not a housewife.

07:18.021 --> 07:22.025
You're soldiers,
and you always will be.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.860
- You're gonna
get us all killed.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.070
- [sighs]

07:25.111 --> 07:27.781
Vicki, can you
give us a second?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.074
- Sure.
- But stay here.

07:29.115 --> 07:29.949
- Yeah.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.701
- I want you to hear this.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.829
Would it change your mind,
Checkers,

07:34.871 --> 07:38.333
if I told you that
Enos Queeth murdered my mother?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.543
- [gasps]

07:40.585 --> 07:43.213
- What?
- Yeah.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.006
I want to tell you guys
a little story

07:45.048 --> 07:47.467
that I've only told
about 40 other people.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.470
[tense music]

07:50.512 --> 07:51.429
* *

07:51.471 --> 07:53.014
Back in the day,

07:53.056 --> 07:56.226
Queeth and my father
were fast friends.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.852
* *

07:57.894 --> 08:00.480
Actually served
in the military together.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.149
Oorah.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.945
But when my father made full
bird colonel in record time,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.907
it sent Queeth
into a jealous rage.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.534
The night
of my fifth birthday,

08:12.575 --> 08:14.077
he came over to our house

08:14.119 --> 08:16.579
looking to put an end
to my father's life.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.791
Instead,
he ended our family.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.793
Put a bullet
in my mother's head.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.630
splattered her brains
all over my face and cake.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.258
Happy birthday to me.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.635
My father was inconsolable.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.388
Queeth stole
the love of his life.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.390
Went into a deep depression.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.560
Tried to fill the void
with the drugs and liqueurs.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.894
Long story short,

08:39.936 --> 08:42.814
Queeth fucking ruined him.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.650
So the day I turned 18,
I went down

08:45.692 --> 08:49.195
and I joined the Green Berets,
Navy SEALs, and Coast Guard

08:49.237 --> 08:54.075
and made it my life's mission
to take Queeth down.

08:54.117 --> 08:58.163
So, you see, this isn't
just any mission for me.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.831
This is personal.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.253
- I remain in.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.629
- Thank you, soldier.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.308
- Fine.
- Checkers, really?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.643
- Yes, but please
stop calling me Checkers.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.936
- Of course.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.189
Now let's go
stop this son of a bitch.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.607
- Yeah, and how are we
gonna do that?

09:25.648 --> 09:28.276
We have exactly zero leads.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.236
- Guess again, Checkers.

09:30.278 --> 09:34.532
Queeth's go-to scientist,
Irina Poliskaya.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.950
- The world's
preeminent chemist

09:35.992 --> 09:38.036
in the field
of organophosphates.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
She's got every degree
in the book.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.999
- And a heart as black as
the coal in Queeth's stocking.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.043
- So you think she's gonna
synthesize Brimstone?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.587
- I bet your baby's life on it.
- MacGruber!

09:47.629 --> 09:49.923
- Vicki, I don't want
Piper's baby to get murdered

09:49.964 --> 09:51.633
or even die
of natural causes,

09:51.675 --> 09:53.802
but that's how certain I am.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.137
Poliskaya is our synthesizer.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.722
- Well, then we need
to find her and get to her

09:57.764 --> 09:58.973
before Queeth does.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.142
[keyboard clicking]
- ICDAG.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.353
The International Chemical
Defense Association Gala.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.646
- [slurs words]
...Gala!

10:04.688 --> 10:06.356
Yeah, I know it well.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.316
The International...Gala.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.652
Yeah, that's right.
I know it very well.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.114
- Well, it says here there's a
big soiree in Miami this week.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.491
Every top chemical engineer
in the world will be there.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.453
And guess who's getting
a lifetime achievement award?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.330
- [gasps]

10:25.834 --> 10:27.252
Irina Poliskaya.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.923
- As I suspected.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.675
- Queeth must have timed
this whole operation

10:33.717 --> 10:35.010
for when he'd have access
to her.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.512
- Checkers,
this ain't no coinky-dink.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.848
No, this is an on-purpy-dink.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.558
- So what's our plan,
MacGruber?

10:41.599 --> 10:45.311
- Looks like we're going
fishing for Russian scientists.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.604
- It won't be easy.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.023
She's gonna be
under heavy guard.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.859
- You can catch anything
if you use a big enough worm.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.444
- It's true.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.654
- Hey, MacGruber,
we can't keep driving around

10:54.696 --> 10:55.864
in that car of yours.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.323
It's kind of hard
to stay undercover

10:57.365 --> 10:58.533
in a bright red Miata.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.703
- Way ahead of you, Checkers.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.706
[heroic music]

11:04.748 --> 11:08.793
* *

11:08.835 --> 11:10.211
- Yep, much better.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.471
[Loverboy's
"Lovin' Every Minute of It"]

11:19.512 --> 11:20.680
* *

11:20.722 --> 11:22.390
- * I'm not a man *

11:22.432 --> 11:23.558
* Or machine *

11:23.600 --> 11:26.019
* I'm just something
in between *

11:26.061 --> 11:28.980
all: * Whoa-oh, whoa-oh *

11:29.022 --> 11:31.608
- * I'm all love,
a dynamo *

11:31.649 --> 11:34.194
* So push the button
and let me go *

11:34.235 --> 11:36.404
all: * Whoa-oh, whoa-oh *

11:36.446 --> 11:40.075
- * Aah, you want me
to come alive? *

11:40.116 --> 11:42.619
* Flick the switch
into overdrive *

11:42.660 --> 11:45.246
* You and me can let it be *

11:45.288 --> 11:46.623
* Ready *
all: * Ready *

11:46.664 --> 11:49.417
- * Aim *
all: * Aim *

11:49.459 --> 11:50.960
- * Fire *

11:51.002 --> 11:53.421
* Touch that dial,
turn me on *

11:53.463 --> 11:56.299
* Start me like a motor,
make me run *

11:56.341 --> 11:57.967
* Lovin' every minute of it *

11:58.009 --> 11:59.094
* Lovin' *

11:59.135 --> 12:00.762
* Lovin' every minute of it *

12:00.804 --> 12:03.723
- Big worm is in position.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.600
How are we looking, Checkers?

12:05.642 --> 12:06.851
- Give me a sec.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.688
[dramatic music]

12:09.729 --> 12:10.855
[gun cocks]

12:10.897 --> 12:12.065
- Who are you?

12:12.107 --> 12:13.525
- The night shift.
[gunshots]

12:17.904 --> 12:19.698
I'm in.
- Okay, gang.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.658
This is for all the marbles.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.618
We won't get another chance.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.036
Vicki, you in place?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.122
- Yeah, I'm at your 11:00.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.792
Sorry, Central Standard Time.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.753
[romantic music]

* *

12:40.468 --> 12:41.386
- There you are.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.225
[chuckles nervously]
Wow, you look...

12:47.267 --> 12:48.435
fine.

12:48.476 --> 12:53.481
- Well,
you also look...only fine.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.066
- Hey, I got eyes
on Poliskaya.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.569
She's by the bar,
and she's got company.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.778
Big company.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.155
- Piece of cake.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.324
Watch and learn, kid.
Watch and learn.

13:08.204 --> 13:12.625
Same old science bullshit,
different science day.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.545
What's up, turtledove?
Buy you an eggnog?

13:15.587 --> 13:16.629
- No.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.883
- [chuckles]
Hey, I can take a hint.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.552
Barkeep, two gin martinis.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.679
And I'll have mine...

13:24.721 --> 13:26.097
very dirty.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.605
Allow me.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.153
So, do you like it dirty?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.201
- The lady does not wish
to talk to you.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.869
- [in Russian accent]
Oh, the lady does not want

13:47.911 --> 13:49.537
to talk to me, huh?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.123
[normally] That's what you
sound like, you fucking dode.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.876
In fact, the only thing
more stupid than your accent

13:54.918 --> 13:57.879
is the way you're dressed,
the content of your brain,

13:57.921 --> 13:59.964
and your fucking face.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.591
- You will leave now.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.386
- [in Russian accent]
I will leave now.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.056
Fine.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.141
Let me just settle my bill.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.314
Barkeep, put those
on the Queeth tab.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.899
[dramatic musical sting]

14:17.941 --> 14:19.067
- It's an open bar.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.652
- You're an open bar!

14:20.694 --> 14:24.030
Queeth. Tab. Now.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.700
- [speaking Russian]
- [speaking Russian]

14:28.493 --> 14:29.953
- [in Russian accent]
Da.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.583
- Sorry, Jorgus can be
a little overprotective.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.876
Have we met?

14:36.918 --> 14:39.462
- Let's just say
I'm a friend of a friend.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.841
Thank you. Here.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.052
Oh, I got a little tip for you.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.220
Keep the change.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.058
- All right.
Hurry, MacGruber.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.560
The presentation starts
in ten minutes,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.603
and you need five
for the capsule to take effect.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.938
- Loud and...

14:56.980 --> 14:59.899
[dramatic music]

14:59.941 --> 15:01.484
* *

15:03.028 --> 15:04.529
Got a little boogie.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.789
[chuckles]

15:14.831 --> 15:17.709
Holy shit! Does that guy
have his wiener out?

15:17.751 --> 15:18.960
Oh, he fully does!

15:19.002 --> 15:21.171
Oh, you got to turn your head
and see this!

15:21.212 --> 15:22.547
It's so small!

15:22.589 --> 15:24.758
It's like a snail,
or is it--

15:24.799 --> 15:27.135
No, "it's a snail"
is the perfect way to put it!

15:27.177 --> 15:28.636
Oh, my God!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.638
People are going nuts
over there!

15:30.680 --> 15:34.309
[forced laughter]

15:34.351 --> 15:35.268
No?

15:35.310 --> 15:36.978
Oh, God.
You're missing out.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.980
Turn that head!

15:39.022 --> 15:40.523
[laughs harder]

15:40.565 --> 15:44.194
Oh, my God. Look at this!
You don't want to see this?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.321
Oh, it looks like
he's gonna pull up his pants!

15:46.363 --> 15:48.656
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
It's still there!

15:48.698 --> 15:50.909
No? Okay.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.535
All right.
All right.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.955
Ooh, let's have
a head-turning contest!

15:55.997 --> 15:57.290
I'll start.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.500
- [exhales sharply]

15:58.541 --> 16:00.502
Vicki, we need a distraction.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.920
- On it.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.799
Ahh!

16:05.840 --> 16:07.759
No!

16:07.801 --> 16:10.512
Look at me!

16:10.553 --> 16:12.597
Over here!

16:12.639 --> 16:17.102
Ahh!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.777
- Okay.
That worked, I guess.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
Now get in position
for phase two, Vicki.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.155
- On the groove.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.247
- Where were we?
Oh, that's right.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.456
We were getting
to know each other,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
and it was going fucking great.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.335
Is it just me,
or are we

16:42.377 --> 16:45.588
in a major opposites-attract
situation here?

16:45.630 --> 16:47.549
'Cause you travel
with protection,

16:47.590 --> 16:51.594
and I never, ever,
ever use protection.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.140
What do you say
we get out of here?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.517
- You're very persistent,
Mr...

17:00.395 --> 17:02.897
- Jebblidoo.
- Mm.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.151
- Matias Jebblidoo.

17:06.192 --> 17:10.989
- Mm, it's been a unique
pleasure, Mr. Jebblidoo.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.783
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a prior obligation.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.871
- Oh, hate for you
to go Russian off,

17:17.912 --> 17:20.665
but if you must,
then Soviet.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.127
To humor.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.271
She's walking.
She did it.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.731
She drank it.
I did it.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.149
I got her to drink it.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.734
Fuck yeah.
You got her, Checkers?

17:47.776 --> 17:50.945
- I got her, but please
stop calling me that.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.323
Vicki, you in place?

17:53.365 --> 17:54.657
- Set to jet.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.537
- All right. I'm in the pipe,
five by five.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.543
- Oh! Give me one moment.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.010
- Okay.
I lost eyes on her.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.303
This is all you, Vick.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.903
- Excuse me, do you have
any toilet paper?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.699
- Let me see if I have some.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.243
Oh, you're in luck.
Here you go.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.632
Sorry!

18:52.674 --> 18:55.051
She's out.
Commencing the old switcheroo.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.428
- Great work, Vick.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.641
- Heads up, Vicki.
Your company has got company.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.394
[gunshots]

19:07.230 --> 19:10.233
Okay, Vicki. Jack has just
replaced Poliskaya's guard.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.609
Proceed with caution.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.987
- Just making
some final adjustments.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.325
- Everything all right
in there?

[dramatic music]

19:22.370 --> 19:24.497
* *

19:24.539 --> 19:25.915
- [speaking Russian]

19:35.133 --> 19:37.677
- Now remember, Vicki,
we only need Queeth's guy

19:37.719 --> 19:39.679
to think you're Poliskaya
for a few minutes

19:39.721 --> 19:41.973
until I can get
the real Poliskaya out of here.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.142
Then, you can give that
fucking jughead the slip.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.394
And then,
we are in the clear.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.520
- There you are.
- [gasps]

19:47.562 --> 19:49.522
- Hi, Miss Poliskaya.
- That's me.

19:49.564 --> 19:50.857
- We're ahead of schedule.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.026
We're ready to bring you
to the stage right now.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.447
- Great.
That's where I want to be.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.990
- The ballroom is packed,

19:59.032 --> 20:02.869
and people are really excited
to hear your speech.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.537
- My speech?

20:04.579 --> 20:06.498
Yes, of course.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.084
It's not just an award.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.878
It's also a speech.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.837
- Right this way.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.300
- What do I do? What's
he saying about a speech?

20:17.342 --> 20:18.426
That wasn't part of the plan!

20:18.468 --> 20:20.470
- Plans change, Vick.
Roll with it.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.554
- What do you mean
plans change?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.723
What am I supposed to say?

20:23.765 --> 20:25.558
- Don't worry.
I got your six.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.893
As the near-recipient

20:26.935 --> 20:28.895
of several
lifetime achievement awards,

20:28.937 --> 20:31.064
I know that
a speech is de rigueur,

20:31.106 --> 20:33.733
so I took the liberty of
writing you an amazing speech.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.653
It's already
under your podium.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.530
- [in a Russian accent]
Thank you.

20:40.949 --> 20:44.202
- And now,
it is my great pleasure

20:44.244 --> 20:45.787
to welcome the recipient

20:45.829 --> 20:49.082
of this year's ICDA
lifetime achievement award,

20:49.124 --> 20:52.085
Dr. Irina Poliskaya.

[applause]

21:19.237 --> 21:20.155
[award thuds]

21:24.993 --> 21:26.453
- [in a Russian accent]
Russian hello.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.456
[quirky music]

21:29.497 --> 21:36.671
* *

21:41.343 --> 21:44.262
[crumpling echoes]

22:02.697 --> 22:06.868
Webster's dictionary
defines "science"

22:06.910 --> 22:10.663
as the state or act of...

22:10.705 --> 22:13.792
being scientific.

22:15.335 --> 22:21.049
And this definition
appears in the S's.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.688
- Great job, Vick!

22:34.729 --> 22:36.815
Sounds like that audience
is eating that shit up

22:36.856 --> 22:38.650
like a fucking pot roast.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.443
Keep going.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.446
- Science.

22:43.488 --> 22:46.533
Science is all around us.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.119
Right?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.287
They know.

22:51.329 --> 22:55.250
It's when you hear
your favorite song,

22:55.291 --> 22:56.793
when you...

22:59.129 --> 23:01.840
That is science.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.758
When you get
into an elevator

23:03.800 --> 23:07.887
and sometimes
there's a funny smell,

23:07.929 --> 23:11.057
that's also science.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.184
- Okay.
You got 'em on the hook.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.855
Now just reel 'em in
nice and easy.

23:16.896 --> 23:22.277
- Science is weather...

23:26.406 --> 23:29.409
corn...

23:29.451 --> 23:32.829
and electric.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.083
- The laundry is
in the hamper.

23:37.125 --> 23:40.879
Vicki, bring it home.
- Oh, thank God.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.089
Okay, well, that concludes
my speech about science.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.259
Believe in your dreams!
Russian goodbye.

23:46.301 --> 23:49.137
[scattered applause]

23:51.264 --> 23:52.766
- Great job, Vick!

23:52.807 --> 23:54.934
I had no idea
you knew all that stuff.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.686
Now just head
to the bathroom,

23:56.728 --> 23:58.271
change into the outfit
I left you,

23:58.313 --> 23:59.647
and get out here.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.775
By the time they figure out
our little trick play,

24:01.816 --> 24:04.027
we'll be long gone.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.696
- Let's go.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.451
Car is out back.
- Car?

24:11.493 --> 24:12.786
- We're going to the lab.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.705
- For the synthesis?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.041
- Yeah.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.797
- Do you mind
if I use the potty again?

24:23.838 --> 24:25.131
- You're gonna have
to hurry that up.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.008
We're on a tight schedule here.
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.431
Guys, can you hear me?

24:33.473 --> 24:36.768
They're going to the lab.
I think I should go with them.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.812
- Vicki, we already got
what we came for.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.105
Now stick to the plan.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.940
- But they think
I'm a scientist!

24:41.981 --> 24:43.983
If I can get my hands
on Brimstone and destroy it,

24:44.025 --> 24:45.819
we can end this thing
once and for all!

24:45.860 --> 24:48.071
- No, it's too dangerous.
Leave now!

24:48.113 --> 24:50.198
- But this is just
a temporary solution.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.033
Yeah, we've stopped
this scientist this time,

24:52.075 --> 24:53.827
but eventually they're
gonna find someone else

24:53.868 --> 24:55.120
to synthesize it.
- Look, Vicki.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.330
If you go to that lab,
we can't protect you.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.417
- I have to take that chance.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.670
- Vicki, please.

25:03.712 --> 25:07.007
If you do this,
you will die.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.343
- If I don't,
millions of people will die.

25:10.385 --> 25:13.513
- [exhales sharply]
Hey, this is a direct order.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.557
Stick to the goddamn plan!

25:15.598 --> 25:17.475
All right?

25:17.517 --> 25:19.811
Vicki!

25:19.853 --> 25:22.939
Vicki, did you hear
what I said?

25:24.899 --> 25:26.735
- Yeah, I heard
exactly what you said.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.074
Plans change.

25:37.328 --> 25:38.538
Take me to the lab.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.248
- After you.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.459
- Vicki,
please don't do this!

25:42.500 --> 25:43.710
Vicki! Vicki!

25:43.752 --> 25:46.004
- Vicki, come in!

25:46.046 --> 25:47.964
Vicki! Vicki!

25:48.006 --> 25:49.841
Come on, Vicki! Please!

25:56.473 --> 25:59.392
[dramatic music]

25:59.434 --> 26:06.399
