WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:05.400
<i>You are truly a weaver.</i>

00:05.560 --> 00:07.120
<i>I didn't finish.</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:10.080
In time, you will
complete your forespell

00:10.240 --> 00:13.120
and your familiar will be revealed.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.840
I am no charlatan.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.320
My kind are loyal to the crown,
Lord Burghley,

00:20.480 --> 00:23.400
Then why keep this marriage
secret from Her Majesty?

00:23.560 --> 00:26.240
I've sent ambassadors to Bohemia
to retrieve Kelley.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.520
-The Emperor rebuffed them.
-Very well, Your Majesty.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.400
I will bring you Kelley.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.440
Then I may forgive
your recent mistakes.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.480
This is what mating is.
An unspeakable urge to possess you,

00:36.640 --> 00:39.600
body and soul.
The rage that feeds on it.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.120
Matthew.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.000
I am nothing without Diana!

00:43.160 --> 00:45.040
I have done all that I can do
to help you.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.720
Stay away from her.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.320
-Kit?
-Louisa!

00:48.480 --> 00:51.240
-I came to see my brother.
-We have much to discuss.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.960
Your heart's broken,
and yet it still beats for him.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.920
<i>The Book of Life</i>
<i>was in this possession.</i>

00:56.080 --> 00:57.640
He tore three of its pages out.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.960
Kelley claims to have
bequeathed a single page

01:00.120 --> 01:02.480
to each of the three species.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.520
Is everything all right?

01:04.680 --> 01:06.720
I don't think so.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.960
You know, there's a part of me
that can imagine staying here,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.960
building a life together,
you, me and Jack.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.800
Hmm. If only
it were that simple.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.040
But we don't belong in this time.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.160
Perhaps we've already
been here too long.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.760
Why can't I come with you today?

02:01.800 --> 02:04.200
The Queen can be unpredictable
at the best of times.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.800
But when someone has failed her,
she can be especially vengeful.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.600
You're being overprotective.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.560
This is not about me
protecting you, Diana.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.640
This is about your presence
making matters even worse.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.200
Find the way with your magic so
we can return to the present.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.400
I'll escort you to Goody Allsop's.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.520
Oh, Diana, we've missed you.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.080
She has been unwell.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.840
We feared she would
not survive the winter.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.440
Goody?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.520
I told you I'd come back.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.160
Oh!

03:13.320 --> 03:18.360
Perhaps you are the tonic I require.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.480
Much has happened for us
since you've been away.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.080
Agnes Sampson was tortured.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.000
And Scotland
is aflame with witch hunts.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.920
The persecutions are spreading
south like wildfire.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.280
We are the last of the weavers now.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.840
I'll see what I can do to quell
any anxiety at Whitehall.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.320
Master Roydon.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.360
Your countenance has changed
since we last met.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.440
The dark clouds that circled you

03:45.600 --> 03:47.920
have lifted somewhat.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.760
Kind of you to say.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.480
But there is something else.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.800
I'm pregnant.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.120
That's impossible.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.040
Apparently not.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.560
Vampires reproduce
through resurrection.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.440
This child would be overturning

05:35.600 --> 05:39.680
thousands of years,
millennia, of biology.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.080
It's funny, I...

05:42.240 --> 05:44.960
I felt different.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.360
But I didn't dare
to entertain the thought.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.640
This is uncharted territory, Diana.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.840
We have to get back to our
own time as soon as we can.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.480
What about Jack?

05:59.600 --> 06:03.240
I hate the idea of leaving him
as much as you do.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.960
I'll ensure that
he's well looked after.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.880
First, I must placate the Queen.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.600
Then I'll make
arrangements for Jack.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.720
We can't go back yet, Matthew.
Not until I perfect my magic.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.600
I still have
the final knots to master.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.760
I will meet with the Queen
alone.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.440
And I will buy you
the time that you need.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.400
Goody, are you sure
you're well enough?

06:55.560 --> 06:57.840
I'm not dead yet, Diana.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.480
To return to your own time,
you need to complete your training.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.440
Shall I fetch the others?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.360
With haste please, Susanna.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.600
Matthew, going to court.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.760
I thought you'd gone forever.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.520
What of the witch?
Are you free of her?

07:24.680 --> 07:28.080
Kit, why can't you understand?

07:29.360 --> 07:33.560
As long as Diana and I are
alive, we will never be parted.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.760
Never.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.200
You have mastered knot three, Diana,

07:45.360 --> 07:49.440
but there are 10 knots.
Still much to do.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.640
I see them.
The threads of the universe.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.320
You are humming
with a new and powerful energy.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.200
I can feel it.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.240
You know what to do.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.520
With knot of one,
the spell is begun.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.400
With knot of two, the spell is true.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.720
With knot of three,
the spell is free.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.960
With knot of four,
the power is stored.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.800
With knot of five,
the spell will thrive.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.240
With knot of six, this spell I fix.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.920
With knot of seven,
the spell will waken.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.280
It is a firedrake!

10:29.680 --> 10:31.800
Focus, Diana.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.760
What do I call you?

10:42.040 --> 10:44.120
Oh!

10:52.200 --> 10:56.160
Your familiar will return
when she is needed.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.240
For now, you must focus
on the knots.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.320
Her Majesty is keen to hear
why you failed your mission.

11:12.480 --> 11:17.160
Perhaps your appearance will distract
her from a crippling toothache.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
-Your Majesty.
-Silence.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.600
I wanted Kelley.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.640
Kelley is a charlatan,

11:53.800 --> 11:56.880
but Emperor Rudolf
will not part with him.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.120
Falsehoods and lies
ooze from your mouth

12:00.280 --> 12:03.280
like drool from a dog!

12:03.440 --> 12:05.160
The Emperor's odious ambassador

12:05.320 --> 12:09.840
informed me that you preferred
to liberate a book!

12:12.000 --> 12:13.960
The clove oil!

12:14.120 --> 12:15.560
Your Majesty.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.840
It is the book I spoke of,
Your Majesty.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.280
The book of greatness
to all creatures.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.720
But not to me.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.080
I beg forgiveness, Your Majesty.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.800
You are a changed man, Shadow.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.560
I tire of your false deference.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.360
You will hand over the book forthwith,
so I may return it to the Ambassador.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.040
I'm sorry.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.680
It was stolen en route from Bohemia.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.360
Is that so?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.280
Lord Burghley,

13:08.440 --> 13:12.480
you will oversee an immediate search
of Master Roydon's home.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.120
It would be my pleasure,
Your Majesty.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.280
-I will gladly accompany...
-You will remain here

13:18.440 --> 13:21.200
until he returns.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.080
Should you be caught in a lie,

13:25.280 --> 13:28.040
your punishment
shall be grave indeed.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.560
Flee

13:32.560 --> 13:35.840
and I will treat your wife
like the witch that she is.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.440
-This has nothing to do...
-One more word

13:39.600 --> 13:43.400
and your severed head
will adorn the palace gates.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.680
I want every book
inside this building.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.240
Tear it apart if you must.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.200
Diana. Diana,
Matthew is in grave danger.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.040
I need you to come with me.
Please.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.120
Kit, what happened to him?

14:19.280 --> 14:22.360
My sources at Whitehall say the
Queen has cast him into a dungeon.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.880
We should fetch Gallowglass.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.720
It would take hours
to scour all the taverns!

14:25.880 --> 14:27.600
Look, I know that we've
had our differences,

14:27.760 --> 14:31.280
but surely we are united in our
desire for Matthew's safety.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.160
Let's go to him, now.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.960
I will not ask you again.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.520
Hand it over, boy.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.400
-Master Roydon will not be...
-Roydon's feelings are irrelevant.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.320
Our orders come directly
from the Queen.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.480
And I advise you not to interfere.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.720
Why on God's earth
did you steal the book?

15:16.880 --> 15:20.480
I had to.
Rudolf wasn't going to surrender it.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.320
Had I known you were returning,
I would have advised you against it.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.920
The persecution
of witches is escalating.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.040
The Queen's paranoia
will be the death of us all.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.440
I would vouch for you, but I am
not in the Queen's good grace.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.920
I could summon Hal? Or Mary?
She has the Queen's ear.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.760
I need to solve this myself,
old friend.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.440
Before Cecil returns.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.240
How?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.720
With the truth.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.680
There's nothing else here, sir.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.840
Check every room again.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.560
Our work here is done.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.800
I hope Master Roydon's books
will be returned.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.000
I doubt he will have
need of books for much longer.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.520
Whoa!
You will stand aside.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.880
Well,
I am loyal to Master Roydon.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.280
And I'm afraid I've sworn
to protect his interests.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
Your misplaced loyalties
will not end well.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.840
I suggest you
stand aside immediately.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.560
Gallowglass...

17:24.880 --> 17:27.000
Gentlemen.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.480
Your Majesty.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.200
Your blood could make me immortal.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.440
Altering the English succession by
placing a creature on the throne,

19:13.600 --> 19:17.240
as I told your father before you,
would lead to chaos.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.000
My death will lead to chaos.

19:20.160 --> 19:24.320
My enemies snap at my heels.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.280
What will happen when I am gone?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.600
There will be no Spanish invasion.

19:33.760 --> 19:38.280
And, as for the witches,
they need not concern you.

19:39.560 --> 19:43.280
How can you possibly know
your Queen's future?

19:45.760 --> 19:47.640
Because I have seen it.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.760
You are no astrologer.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.960
Diana is a time-spinner.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.520
We arrived here in 1590
from centuries in the future.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.160
Many would think
you were delusional.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.800
If these claims came
from anyone but you, Shadow,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.920
I would not believe a word.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.800
And yet, in your heart,

20:30.600 --> 20:32.240
you know it to be true.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.800
You are a future, Matthew.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.000
Your true Shadow
could not have disappointed you so.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.080
And my realm...

21:10.960 --> 21:12.720
It is secure.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.960
And 500 years hence,

21:16.120 --> 21:20.000
every man, woman
and child knows your name.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.280
Queen Elizabeth I.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.200
Gloriana,

21:26.360 --> 21:31.120
the greatest monarch
in English history.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.120
Matthew.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.880
Thank you.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.280
You're welcome.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.240
Bess.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.880
Diana?

22:24.040 --> 22:27.960
Pierre and Gallowglass have gone
to fetch her from Goody Alsop's.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.880
Master Roydon!

22:46.280 --> 22:48.640
He took
every book in the house.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.880
Damn it!

22:55.200 --> 22:57.280
Except this one.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.840
I stole it back when
Gallowglass stopped them.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.080
They had no idea.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.480
Jack, that was incredibly dangerous.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.760
Well done.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.080
Well done, my boy.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.240
Matthew, is Diana here?

23:17.400 --> 23:18.920
I thought you were fetching her.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.360
The witches said
she left them hours ago.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.080
And we can't find her.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.680
Matthew.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.040
Matthew? Kit, where is he?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.600
Are you sure
this is the right place?

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
I'm certain of it.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.480
Ah!

23:49.640 --> 23:53.360
So this is the creature
who bewitched my brother.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.760
Louisa.

23:58.160 --> 24:02.400
Christopher took some
persuading to lure you here.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.960
Spirited.
I like that.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.560
I did not bewitch Matthew.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.240
What do you want from me?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.800
Kit!

24:20.960 --> 24:24.160
We should bind her,
take her to the ship.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.400
Oh, poor sweet Christopher.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.600
There is no ship.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.440
But we agreed.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.520
She is to be exiled for
Matthew to be freed of her.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.360
No, Kit.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.880
The witch must die.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.760
There are eyes
everywhere in this city.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.160
Aye. Especially
amongst creatures.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.280
She can't have passed through the
streets without drawing the attention

25:04.440 --> 25:05.760
of Hubbard's flock.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.840
I'll interrogate
every last one of them.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.520
Find out.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.320
Where are you?

25:33.160 --> 25:36.960
If any harm comes to me,
Matthew will despise you forever.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.320
And Philippe will seek vengeance.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.560
You dare make assumptions
of my father?

25:45.720 --> 25:47.800
Matthew and I are married.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.680
I am Philippe's
blood-sworn daughter.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.080
I'm surprised you didn't notice.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.800
Let me go, Louisa.

26:08.960 --> 26:12.240
You must be powerful indeed
to bewitch Philippe.

26:13.480 --> 26:18.680
But I will free him
from your thrall.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.680
You are making a grave mistake.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.560
The first shot can be yours.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.240
Maybe we should just
leave her down here.

26:41.400 --> 26:46.440
The only way to win back Matthew's
regard is to free him of the witch.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.600
Kit, your gift is your mind,
your words.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.680
Oh, the words have eluded him.

26:55.840 --> 27:01.880
Your presence has robbed him
of all that he holds dear.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.800
You're not a murderer.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.600
Matthew is a fool to favor her.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.440
But when she is dead,

27:21.600 --> 27:24.200
you will be there to comfort him.

27:25.480 --> 27:30.840
We do this for Matthew.
For love.

27:32.520 --> 27:37.160
"It lies not
in our power to love or hate

27:37.320 --> 27:41.400
"For will in us is overruled by fate

27:41.560 --> 27:45.160
"When two are stripped,
long ere the course begin,

27:47.760 --> 27:51.680
"We wish that one shall lose,
the other win.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.720
"Where both deliberate,
the love is slight

27:55.880 --> 27:59.560
"Whoever loved, that loved
not at first sight?"

28:03.800 --> 28:06.120
What mischief is this?

28:08.200 --> 28:13.000
They're from your poem, Kit.
<i>Hero and Leander.</i>

28:13.160 --> 28:16.000
I have never spoken
these words to anyone.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.080
You want to know your future?
I'll tell you everything.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.960
Please.

28:36.280 --> 28:40.560
Christopher is weak.
I am not.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.680
Louisa.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.800
You struck me down!

28:56.960 --> 28:59.480
She had you in her thrall.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.000
And yet you missed.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.000
I shall not miss this time.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.440
Louisa, no!

29:07.280 --> 29:11.600
<i>Your familiar will return</i>
<i>when she is needed.</i>

29:11.760 --> 29:13.480
Corra!

29:16.480 --> 29:18.200
Corra!

29:31.360 --> 29:33.440
God save us!

29:48.560 --> 29:51.440
Shall I tell you your futures?

29:53.840 --> 29:55.920
You have none.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.920
Soon, you will die.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.840
And your deaths will not be gentle.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.600
I promise you that.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.800
-What the hell is that?
-What in God's name...

30:20.960 --> 30:24.640
Diana, stop this.
I'll deal with them now.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.400
They are tortured souls, spare them.

30:28.560 --> 30:32.040
Their continued existence
is punishment enough.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.920
Fucking warned you, Kit.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.640
-Matthew, stop.
-Matthew.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.120
Take them to Bedlam.
I'll deal with them there.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.920
-Come on.
-Matthew.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.120
-No.
-Matthew.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.800
Successful endeavor, Your Majesty.

31:24.960 --> 31:29.200
We retrieved every last book
from Matthew Roydon's residence.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.920
Matthew is forgiven.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.960
Now...

31:37.120 --> 31:39.560
Leave me in peace.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.800
Matthew?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.840
Matthew?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.960
Mistress Roydon?

32:15.120 --> 32:18.040
Matthew should be back by now.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.720
We should check on him.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.400
You don't want to go
to Bedlam, aunty. Trust me.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.840
You'll take me.
Or I'll find it myself.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.600
Down there.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.520
Matthew.

33:02.800 --> 33:07.120
You should not have come here.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.480
Open your eyes.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.680
This is the witch of the prophecy.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.960
She will destroy you...

33:29.120 --> 33:31.920
...and all our kind.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.880
-Matthew, stop.
-Diana, stay back.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.360
Yes, brother.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.840
Let her see the wolf.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.800
Matthew, you're not this man.
Not anymore.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.160
Yes, brother.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.160
Tear out my throat.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.080
You can resist it.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.640
Redefine who you are.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.760
Let them live.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.440
They will not die well.
Don't let it be like this.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.520
Not by your hand.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.200
Think of our future.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.400
Our baby.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.160
Baby.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.800
Diana, be careful.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.040
Come home.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.080
Matthew!

35:34.640 --> 35:36.240
Matthew!

36:47.280 --> 36:52.080
Every day of my life
is a battle for control.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.760
A war with myself

36:57.920 --> 37:01.520
over the need to possess you
in ways that

37:01.680 --> 37:05.360
no warmblood could possibly fathom.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.240
The blood rage is all consuming.

37:10.320 --> 37:15.760
All I have ever wanted is to cleanse
myself of its burden and shame.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.040
No.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.960
From here,

38:01.520 --> 38:03.120
the heart vein.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.880
They say it tastes sweeter.

38:08.640 --> 38:13.960
To drink from one's mate is to
know that nothing is hidden.

38:15.080 --> 38:19.600
And all that is left
is complete belonging.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.040
And honesty.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.080
Drink, then.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.840
But I'll know your secrets
and you won't know mine.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.840
I could.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.880
The witch's kiss

38:52.280 --> 38:55.720
allows me to see inside your soul.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.080
You might not like what you find.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.080
You first.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.120
You always smell like honey.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.200
Are you ready?

39:36.560 --> 39:38.120
I trust you.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.160
It's okay.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.320
What did you find?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.040
You.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.080
Only you.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.400
Time walker, Diana.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.280
-Who are you?
-Whatever's coming, I'm ready.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.240
There's a whole world out there
and I want to see it all.

41:59.400 --> 42:03.080
Our priority has to be the
missing pages from the Book of Life.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.800
It's possible that Diana
Bishop's aunts already have it.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.160
I have reason to believe
they're being sheltered

42:10.320 --> 42:12.600
at Sept-Tours.

42:12.760 --> 42:16.880
There's someone else close by.
A powerful creature.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.440
Protect the baby.
