00:56.792 --> 00:58.292
Good morning!

01:04.625 --> 01:05.792
That's a good leg.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.666
Okay, fine.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.375
But we have to be fast.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.374
Are you close?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.916
I really can't start sweating, baby.

01:15.917 --> 01:17.667
‐ Yeah, I'm working on it, darling.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.082
Okay.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.791
‐ Okay, I'm sorry. I have to get ready.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.292
I'm so sorry.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.874
It's so bright in here, too. It's just‐‐

01:26.875 --> 01:28.083
And then your sweat.

01:29.208 --> 01:30.916
I'm sorry. You can watch me, though.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.124
Watch me!

01:32.125 --> 01:34.208
‐ Yeah, okay, that's romantic.

01:39.417 --> 01:40.750
‐ What the hell?

01:41.625 --> 01:43.582
Oh my God. Shit!

01:43.583 --> 01:46.167
Shit! Shit!

01:46.542 --> 01:48.042
Oh my God. Shit!

01:48.375 --> 01:50.791
My grandma's ring's
not in my jewelry case.

01:50.792 --> 01:51.958
Shit!

01:52.333 --> 01:55.083
Oh my God. Shit! Shit!

01:55.500 --> 01:59.082
No offense, Ny‐Ny, but I really
have never had an issue with a guy

01:59.083 --> 02:01.082
coming before, you know.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.625
Never. Not in my life.
Usually, it's the opposite problem.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.041
And don't say it's like the age thing.
Because I've had older boyfriends.

02:07.042 --> 02:09.457
‐ It's the age thing.
‐ Not the age thing.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.207
It's not you, it's me.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.082
‐ Yeah, no shit.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.499
‐ I meant it's you, it's not me.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.833
‐ You're so funny, Nyles.
Oh my God, you're hilarious.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.291
‐ Hey, Misty.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.625
What?

02:24.542 --> 02:25.750
‐ Will you kill me?
‐ Nyles!

02:26.417 --> 02:30.166
Look, I know weddings make you
super weird, super uncomfortable,

02:30.167 --> 02:33.999
but please, I'm begging you
do not bring our drama here, okay.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.374
Because this is truly a sacred day,

02:36.375 --> 02:37.832
and it doesn't belong to us.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.000
This day belongs to Tala,
and it belongs to Abe.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.750
You gonna be happy?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.750
Are you gonna be smiley?

02:46.792 --> 02:48.082
That's a weird smile.

03:03.042 --> 03:04.042
Whoo!

03:05.458 --> 03:06.875
Ha ha.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.374
Shukran.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.207
Good day so far?

03:12.208 --> 03:15.666
‐ Today, tomorrow, yesterday,
it's all the same.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.749
You?
‐ Today is young.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.375
Ask me again at the end.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.583
Anything can happen.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.916
‐ Not today, sauce pot.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.499
That's a nice try, though.

03:44.042 --> 03:45.916
‐ How gorgeous are these two?

03:45.917 --> 03:48.792
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, you guys?

03:49.167 --> 03:51.666
But, um, no, seriously, okay, guys,

03:51.667 --> 03:53.582
we're all part of this gorgeous tapestry‐‐

03:53.583 --> 03:55.457
‐ No, come on, throw me a bone.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.875
This isn't the day for moderation.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.541
‐ It's not good wine.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.542
‐ I don't care.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.999
‐ Okay, I decided to Google the two
most important things about marriage:

04:04.000 --> 04:05.416
love and commitment.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.957
Love is to feel a deep romantic
or sexual attachment to someone,

04:08.958 --> 04:12.582
and we all know these two li'I freaks
are fine in that department, right?

04:12.583 --> 04:15.249
And commitment is the state

04:15.250 --> 04:18.207
or quality of being dedicated to a cause,

04:18.208 --> 04:20.250
activity, et cetera.

04:24.750 --> 04:25.750
‐ Oh, she's done.

04:26.583 --> 04:27.874
Whoo!

04:27.875 --> 04:29.332
Thank you.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.791
I love you guys.
Um, so without further ado,

04:31.792 --> 04:34.166
I'd like to welcome up
the actual big sister

04:34.167 --> 04:35.417
of the bride, Sarah.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.417
‐ Get on up there, peanut.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.207
‐ No one told me that
I was supposed to make a speech.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.416
‐ Of course you're supposed to give
a speech, you're the maid of honor.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.999
It's‐‐ it's your main job.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.957
‐ She's been drinking, Howard.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.000
Sarah.

04:54.125 --> 04:57.082
‐ Bonsoir, mi família

04:57.083 --> 04:58.499
et amici!

04:58.500 --> 05:00.457
‐ Who is that?
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?

05:00.458 --> 05:03.041
‐ Going in for the save, babe.
I'd like to share my thoughts on love.

05:03.042 --> 05:04.541
‐ What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.249
No, no, no, no, no.
‐ Yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.499
‐ Who's this guy?
‐ Misty's boyfriend.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.624
Why is he dressed for a luau?

05:09.625 --> 05:11.458
Oh my God, Nyles.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.500
We are born

05:15.417 --> 05:16.791
lost.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.624
Then... we're found,

05:19.625 --> 05:22.249
but we're all just lost, am I right?

05:22.250 --> 05:23.541
‐ Oh my God.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.249
‐ However, in the darkness

05:26.250 --> 05:27.292
comes light.

05:28.583 --> 05:32.541
Tala Anne Wilder
and Abraham Eugene Trent Schlieffen,

05:32.542 --> 05:34.874
who do not look like siblings.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.832
You see, their optimism,
their selflessness,

05:37.833 --> 05:39.250
it's in their blood.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.000
And Tala,

05:41.542 --> 05:43.791
there's something that a lot
of people here don't know about you,

05:43.792 --> 05:44.874
but they should.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.208
I hope you don't mind.

05:47.292 --> 05:52.124
It's not just time and money that Tala
has given to so many charitable causes,

05:52.125 --> 05:54.833
she has also donated of herself.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.250
Bone marrow.

05:56.708 --> 05:57.708
That's right.

05:57.709 --> 05:58.957
‐ How did he know that?
‐ I don't know.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.250
‐ She gave hers

06:01.125 --> 06:02.374
to her baby brother Nico,

06:02.375 --> 06:03.624
saving his life.

06:05.542 --> 06:08.500
But now it's time for us to give to you.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.667
Here you are

06:13.083 --> 06:16.458
standing on the precipice of something
so much bigger than anyone here.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.125
And it may be frightening
and filled with doubt.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.083
But always remember:

06:23.500 --> 06:25.000
you are not alone.

06:26.292 --> 06:28.500
Everyone here is your family.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.208
We are your world.

06:30.209 --> 06:33.041
And we will cheer you on
with delight in our eyes

06:33.042 --> 06:35.166
as you achieve your wildest dreams.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.082
So raise a glass.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.542
We may be born lost,

06:45.500 --> 06:46.583
but now

06:47.708 --> 06:49.208
you are found.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.999
Cheers.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.250
Cheers.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.082
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Let's dance.

06:58.083 --> 07:01.832
♪ Patrick Cowley's Megatron Man
playing on speakers ♪

07:14.708 --> 07:16.874
‐ I already told you no earlier, Randy.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.082
What, what makes you think
that I changed my mind?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.125
‐ I don't know, you've had more to drink?

07:21.833 --> 07:24.166
‐ You can't say that to me, man.
‐ Whatever, I don't need a lecture.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.708
‐ What are you smelling?

08:29.917 --> 08:32.332
‐ Orchid Explosion by Fournier.

08:32.332 --> 08:33.332
Right?

08:33.832 --> 08:34.832
‐ Yeah.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.457
That's very weird.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.874
‐ Well, I know my hair mists.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.957
I dated a girl who used to bathe in it.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.499
‐ Well, I, I don't like it.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.541
Tala got it for me
as a birthday present last year

08:43.542 --> 08:45.791
and if I didn't wear it,
she'd, she'd murder me.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.792
‐ That makes sense.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.375
‐ Here are the drinks
you didn't pick up from the bar.

08:49.875 --> 08:50.875
‐ Thank you!

08:51.417 --> 08:54.207
I always get an extra one.
Save myself a trip.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.583
‐ Or you might just be an alcoholic?

08:55.958 --> 08:57.083
‐ Hmm. Could be.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.667
‐ Thank you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.749
‐ Cheers.
‐ Cheers.

09:04.625 --> 09:05.750
‐ You're Misty's boyfriend?

09:06.125 --> 09:07.791
I don't think that we met at
the rehearsal dinner last night.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.457
‐ I'm Sarah.
‐ Nyles.

09:09.458 --> 09:10.667
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.833
So what's your deal, you don't dance?

09:14.667 --> 09:17.042
‐ Plantar fasciitis, actually.
‐ Ah, respect.

09:17.792 --> 09:21.374
‐ Dear, I have been
to more weddings in my life

09:21.375 --> 09:22.624
than you can imagine‐‐

09:22.625 --> 09:24.999
‐ You might be surprised.
‐ And I have to say

09:25.000 --> 09:29.125
that your speech is the best
wedding speech I've ever heard.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.291
Shukran.

09:31.292 --> 09:33.042
Wow!

09:34.125 --> 09:35.167
Thank you.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.000
That feels good.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.000
‐ Yeah, I bet.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.666
But you don't actually believe
any of the shit that you said?

09:41.667 --> 09:43.041
‐ Not a word of it.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.292
We're all fucking alone.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.875
Hey, uh, you don't want to maybe

09:51.833 --> 09:53.791
go some place where
we could be alone, do you?

09:53.792 --> 09:54.792
‐ Wow!

09:54.793 --> 09:57.708
That is very forward of you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What's your rush?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.000
‐ Well, it's just, you know,

10:02.750 --> 10:05.541
your dad and mom are about to‐‐
‐ Step‐mom. My mom's dead.

10:05.542 --> 10:06.666
‐ Oh.

10:06.667 --> 10:07.792
Yeah, well, um,

10:08.458 --> 10:09.958
they're about to sing a song and I,

10:10.583 --> 10:12.292
I just can't handle that right now.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.083
‐ And, uh,

10:16.084 --> 10:18.792
what would Misty think
about us running off together?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.082
‐ I have a feeling she'd be okay with it.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.957
‐ Oh my God, we're so bad.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.124
‐ We're so bad.
‐ Mmm.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.249
Oh my God!

10:26.250 --> 10:27.874
I can't say I ever liked her.

10:27.875 --> 10:32.082
‐ Yeah, she has her moments,
but... this one hurts.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.541
‐ Why don't you go in there and stop them?

10:33.542 --> 10:36.624
‐ Ooh, trust me, there is not a world
where these two don't end up together.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.999
Say something in Australian to me.

10:40.750 --> 10:41.750
‐ Well,

10:43.917 --> 10:45.333
if it makes you feel any better,

10:45.875 --> 10:48.707
my whole family is embarrassed by me.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.374
They all see me as a,

10:50.375 --> 10:52.666
as a liability who fucks around
and drinks too much.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.332
‐ Why would they think that?

10:54.333 --> 10:55.457
‐ Because I fuck around
and drink too much.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.458
‐ Mmm.

10:56.958 --> 10:58.583
‐ Which they tell me, all the time.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.750
And then they, uh,

11:01.542 --> 11:03.000
try to take care of me,

11:04.250 --> 11:06.041
and it is absolutely suffocating.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.624
‐ Yeah, I've never been big
on unsolicited help.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.791
‐ Exactly, I can fend for myself.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.916
‐ Of course you can.
You don't need a leg up‐‐

11:11.917 --> 11:13.833
Hold my legs up.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.708
‐ That was weird.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.916
‐ This is so fucked up.

11:17.917 --> 11:19.333
‐ So fucked up.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.041
‐ But it's kind of hot, though.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.875
Don't you kiss me.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.417
‐ Don't you tell me what to do.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.375
Hold on.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.250
Come here.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.667
I‐‐ I give up. I‐‐

11:40.292 --> 11:41.958
Will you just please
take off your clothes.

11:42.292 --> 11:43.542
‐ Yeah, you got it.

11:44.583 --> 11:45.583
Yeah.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.500
‐ Ha ha, nice.
‐ Yep.

11:56.042 --> 11:57.667
Ha!
‐ Yeah, yeah.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.207
You wear underwear
under your bathing suit?

12:03.208 --> 12:04.999
Yeah, doesn't everybody?

12:06.917 --> 12:08.874
‐ Oww! Fuck!

12:08.875 --> 12:10.041
‐ What the fuck is happening?

12:10.042 --> 12:11.999
‐ I thought I smelled you,
you piece of shit!

12:14.292 --> 12:15.791
Ahhh!
‐ Oh my God.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.374
What the fuck!

12:17.375 --> 12:19.374
What the fuck is happening!

12:19.375 --> 12:20.791
Oh my God!

12:20.792 --> 12:23.875
Holy fucking shit!

12:24.375 --> 12:25.417
What!

12:26.375 --> 12:27.958
The fuck!

12:36.125 --> 12:37.916
‐ You're a sick fuck, Roy!

13:00.542 --> 13:02.292
‐ Keep running, shit bird.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.208
I will always find you.

13:34.542 --> 13:35.667
Nyles?

13:37.958 --> 13:40.041
‐ No, stop, don't come in here.

13:40.042 --> 13:41.332
‐ Are you okay?

13:41.333 --> 13:42.542
‐ Don't come in here!

13:44.792 --> 13:45.958
Wake up.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.708
Good morning.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.792
‐ That's a good leg.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.332
Okay, fine.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.416
But we have to be fast.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.916
‐ Shukran.
Good day so far?

14:18.917 --> 14:21.749
‐ Today, tomorrow, yesterday,
it's all the same.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.499
You?
‐ Today is young.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.125
Ask me again at the end.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.332
Anything can happen.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.375
You!

14:29.917 --> 14:32.666
‐ What the fuck did you do to me?

14:32.667 --> 14:35.292
‐ Shit.
‐ What the fuck did you do to me?

14:36.083 --> 14:38.749
Hey, come here. Get out of the water.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.083
Get out of the water.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.332
Get out of the water.

14:51.667 --> 14:55.166
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

14:56.333 --> 14:58.541
You're a sick fuck, Roy.

15:08.458 --> 15:09.458
Nyles?

15:09.833 --> 15:12.957
Nyles.
‐ No, stop, don't come in here!

15:12.958 --> 15:15.208
‐ Are you okay?
‐ Don't come in here.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.625
Hello?

15:28.292 --> 15:30.832
What the fuck.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.083
November ninth?

15:51.542 --> 15:53.542
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.292
‐ What the fuck.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.457
Oh, there you are.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.375
Tala, I found Sarah.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.333
We were looking for you
all morning, honey.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.333
‐ Okay.
‐ Come on.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.042
Are you all right?

16:15.333 --> 16:16.374
‐ Yeah.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.458
‐ Sarah, peanut.

16:20.042 --> 16:22.833
You must've gotten up early,
I checked your room at six.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.875
‐ Yeah, I...

16:25.875 --> 16:27.374
went on a hike.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.332
‐ Well, you look exhausted.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.791
Stay hydrated.

16:30.792 --> 16:34.041
‐ Dad, is this, this is, uh,
this is really happening,

16:34.042 --> 16:35.332
right?

16:35.333 --> 16:37.958
I don't understand your question.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.417
‐ This, this day already happened.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.292
‐ What are you saying?

16:45.167 --> 16:46.792
‐ It felt real.

16:47.833 --> 16:51.499
It‐‐ it felt so... real.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.000
Are you on drugs again?

16:58.667 --> 16:59.957
What the fuck

16:59.958 --> 17:01.041
did you do to me?

17:01.042 --> 17:02.832
Hey! Come here!

17:02.833 --> 17:04.582
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just get out of the water.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.375
Come here.
You mother‐‐

17:10.750 --> 17:13.207
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

17:13.208 --> 17:14.332
Sarah!

17:14.333 --> 17:17.165
Oh my God, what are you doing?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.374
Oh!

17:18.375 --> 17:19.375
‐ Whoops.

17:19.376 --> 17:22.374
‐ Oh my God. Oh my God.
‐ You're okay. You're okay.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.665
Jerry! Give me the teeth.

17:24.666 --> 17:27.458
The three front teeth
have pretty much broken off.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.666
There's one full canine and‐‐

17:29.667 --> 17:31.207
This is like
a big day for everyone.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.749
This is a big day for me, too.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.957
The wedding is today, in six hours.

17:34.958 --> 17:37.499
‐ Sarah! Why are you
standing there like a freak?

17:37.500 --> 17:39.708
Why were you in the pool?
‐ This doesn't make any sense.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.042
This doesn't make any fucking sense!

17:43.458 --> 17:44.666
‐ Don't let him in! He can't see me.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.041
‐ What happened? Is she okay?

17:46.042 --> 17:47.082
‐ Get out!

17:47.083 --> 17:48.791
She'll be okay.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.749
I'm taking Tala into town.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.832
This dentist glues teeth!

17:52.833 --> 17:54.958
‐ Yay!
‐ I love you, Daddy.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.124
Oh! Oh!

17:58.125 --> 18:00.417
Sarah, no.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.917
‐ Guess you followed me.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.208
‐ What's going on?

18:10.292 --> 18:12.250
‐ I tried to stop you.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.375
‐ But what is this?

18:15.083 --> 18:16.083
When is this?

18:16.792 --> 18:18.917
‐ Yeah. About that.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.917
So, this is today.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.332
Today is yesterday.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.292
And tomorrow is also today.

18:28.958 --> 18:32.166
It's one of those...
infinite time loop situations

18:32.167 --> 18:33.333
you might have heard about.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.542
‐ That I might have heard about.

18:35.917 --> 18:36.999
‐ Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.499
‐ How do I stop it?
I don't want tomorrow to be today.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.832
I want tomorrow to be tomorrow.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.916
‐ Right. That's natural.

18:42.917 --> 18:45.750
Uh, unfortunately,
that's never going to happen.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.917
Tomorrow will always and forever now be

18:49.667 --> 18:51.542
today. So‐‐

18:55.792 --> 18:56.792
Uh‐‐

18:57.625 --> 18:58.999
Oh, how about this.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.667
Uh, tomorrow,
Tala's teeth will be totally fine.

19:03.417 --> 19:04.458
‐ Which way is that cave?

19:07.375 --> 19:08.667
You don't wanna go there.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.292
Thank you.

19:48.958 --> 19:51.500
Please... where is it?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.375
You gotta wait.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.625
‐ Oh my God, fuck you. Just tell me.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.000
Where?

20:06.208 --> 20:07.375
‐ I told you.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.375
You gotta wait.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.542
‐ What?

20:12.417 --> 20:14.000
Where, where is it?

20:15.208 --> 20:16.208
‐ Wait for it.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.083
Almost.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.292
I am the Antichrist.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.875
I'm just kidding, there is no God.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.417
The earthquake happens every day. But ‐‐

20:42.750 --> 20:43.999
check it out.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.208
Opens up the cave.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.583
You're not gonna find
what you're looking for in there.

20:50.042 --> 20:53.625
Once you go in, the whole day just resets
to wherever you woke up this morning.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.582
Same thing if you stick around.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.375
The second you fall asleep, it all just

20:58.417 --> 21:00.124
goes back to the start.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.916
‐ But will this day end if I go in there?

21:02.917 --> 21:04.250
‐ Sure. For you.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.833
You're wasting your time!

21:18.708 --> 21:20.166
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

21:20.167 --> 21:21.500
‐ No, no, no, no, no.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.458
Wake up.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.667
Good morning.

21:36.542 --> 21:41.499
♪

21:50.333 --> 21:52.207
She didn't leave a note?

21:52.208 --> 21:54.541
‐ Sarah realized the day wasn't
about her, so she left.

21:54.542 --> 21:55.832
‐ Don't say that.

22:03.417 --> 22:04.499
‐ Or she's scared.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.957
‐ Of what?
‐ Families,

22:05.958 --> 22:07.666
weddings, intimacy,

22:07.667 --> 22:10.624
melanoma, nanotech,
round‐the‐clock surveillance.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.500
Sauce.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.083
She'll be back.

22:20.292 --> 22:22.499
‐ And how gorgeous are these two?

22:22.500 --> 22:25.499
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, guys?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.999
Oh, but, um, no, seriously, okay, guys,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.041
I know this is supposed to be like‐‐

22:34.125 --> 22:35.707
Yeah!

22:35.708 --> 22:38.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're staying awake, yeah!

23:12.125 --> 23:14.166
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.916
I'm coming, I'm coming, oh my God!

23:18.917 --> 23:20.332
Sarah?
‐ Oh, excuse me.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.624
‐ Hi.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.291
‐ Wake up.
‐ Sarah, what the hell are you do‐‐

23:24.292 --> 23:25.208
What are you doing?
‐ Ow!

23:25.209 --> 23:27.000
‐ Get dressed. I can't be here anymore.

23:28.958 --> 23:30.417
‐ Oh my God.

23:31.292 --> 23:32.917
Are you fucking cheating on me?

23:33.875 --> 23:34.958
‐ No.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.167
You're cheating on me, you goof.

23:40.167 --> 23:41.167
‐ Wait, what?

23:43.667 --> 23:44.832
I don't know what it is.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.667
It could be life, it could be death.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.166
It might be a dream,
I might be imagining you,

23:49.167 --> 23:51.374
you might be imagining me,
it could be purgatory

23:51.375 --> 23:53.666
or a glitch in the simulation
that we're both in.

23:53.667 --> 23:54.667
I don't know.

23:54.668 --> 23:57.958
So... I decided a while ago to sort of

23:58.500 --> 23:59.667
give up and

24:00.000 --> 24:02.707
stop trying to make sense
of things altogether, because

24:02.708 --> 24:04.957
the only way to really live in this

24:04.958 --> 24:07.125
is to embrace the fact
that nothing matters.

24:07.958 --> 24:09.374
‐ Well, then what's the point of living?

24:09.375 --> 24:12.250
‐ Well, we kind of have
no choice but to live,

24:13.042 --> 24:16.457
so I think your best bet is just

24:16.458 --> 24:19.042
to learn how to suffer existence.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.250
‐ So we can't die?

24:21.583 --> 24:23.374
‐ No. Uh, the loop just starts over.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.916
There might be some way to kill yourself
but I haven't figured it out,

24:25.917 --> 24:29.624
and I've done... a lot of suicides.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.625
So many.

24:31.042 --> 24:34.041
‐ No. No, I'm gonna get out of this.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.875
‐ Okay. Suit yourself.

24:41.708 --> 24:44.292
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Bracing for a quick death.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.583
I mean, we can't die,
but pain is very real.

24:48.083 --> 24:50.625
There's nothing worse
than slowly dying in the ICU.

24:55.292 --> 24:57.292
We could just skip this whole phase,

24:57.750 --> 24:59.333
go get a beer, you know.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.874
Or not. Whatever.

25:04.375 --> 25:05.375
See you tomorrow.

25:06.375 --> 25:08.042
Wake up.

25:11.125 --> 25:12.125
‐ So,

25:13.167 --> 25:14.707
as I was saying,

25:14.708 --> 25:18.208
you just... have to find peace, you know.

25:19.292 --> 25:22.000
‐ I drove all the way back home to Austin,

25:22.750 --> 25:24.582
and I still woke up here.

25:24.583 --> 25:25.542
‐ That's the way it works.

25:25.543 --> 25:27.249
You know, one time,
I smoked a bunch of crystal

25:27.250 --> 25:29.167
and made it all the way
to Equatorial Guinea.

25:30.625 --> 25:31.832
It was a huge waste of time.

25:31.833 --> 25:33.416
They detained me
as soon as I got off the plane.

25:33.417 --> 25:36.249
I was acting a little... odd.

25:36.250 --> 25:38.541
And then I passed out in a couple minutes,

25:38.542 --> 25:39.542
woke up back here.

25:39.543 --> 25:41.917
Whoo!

25:42.500 --> 25:45.250
‐ Darla!
You and me. A hundred bucks.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.208
‐ Who the fuck are you?

25:49.625 --> 25:51.791
Don't you know how to hustle, kid?

25:51.792 --> 25:53.457
‐ I'm an honest man, Darla.

25:53.458 --> 25:54.999
You're gonna lose this game,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.583
but you can keep your money.

25:58.709 --> 26:00.958
Oh my God, who was the guy
that was hunting you?

26:02.333 --> 26:03.333
‐ Fuck!

26:11.375 --> 26:12.458
That was Roy.

26:14.042 --> 26:15.458
He was a guest at the wedding.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.417
Abe's dad's cousin,
of the Schlieffen clan.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.374
That's about all I know about the dude.

26:22.375 --> 26:25.833
‐ Yeah, but...
why was he trying to kill you?

26:30.833 --> 26:33.500
One night, a very long time ago,

26:35.833 --> 26:37.417
I partied with Roy.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.082
This was back in the early days,

26:40.083 --> 26:41.957
before I'd really
acquainted myself with everyone.

26:41.958 --> 26:42.875
‐ Hey, hey.

26:42.876 --> 26:44.207
I was just feeling
my way through it.

26:44.208 --> 26:45.958
‐ Uh, tuna?
‐ Yes, sir.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.124
‐ I know you know.

26:52.125 --> 26:53.500
But you don't know that I know.

26:53.958 --> 26:54.917
Or do you know?

26:54.918 --> 26:56.791
‐ Do you ever wonder
if people think you're boring.

26:58.458 --> 27:00.167
‐ Are you being a dick to the bartender?

27:01.208 --> 27:02.791
I would like a Moscato, please.

27:02.792 --> 27:03.833
‐ Sure.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.291
‐ "What might have been
and what has been point to one end,

27:07.292 --> 27:08.792
which is always present."

27:11.292 --> 27:13.625
‐ On second thought, make that
two shots of bourbon, please.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.041
‐ I like your hat.
‐ Of course you do.

27:26.667 --> 27:27.833
Thank you, ma'am.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.249
To the struggle.

27:31.168 --> 27:32.916
Mister and Missus Schlieffen.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.874
Here they are.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.874
‐ Confucius said: Marriage is
a bottomless pit of sorrow

27:37.875 --> 27:39.332
that makes you forget who you are.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.541
‐ He did not.

27:40.542 --> 27:42.708
‐ But there is a bottom, my friend.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.375
And it is a fucking dark place.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.958
What do you say, bud?
You wanna dance a little bit?

27:54.750 --> 27:55.750
‐ Okay.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.291
‐ You know the officiant douchebag
in the ridiculous suit?

27:59.292 --> 28:00.250
Trevor.

28:00.251 --> 28:01.667
He's got a bag
of sweets in his pocket.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.917
I tried to hit him up,
but he said he did not want to share.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.667
‐ ...money. Um,
but tonight is not about me.

28:10.917 --> 28:12.999
‐ You were right. Got 'em.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.457
I don't know what that was.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.582
‐ Oi, open up, you cunts.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.124
‐ Give me my shit back! Come on!

28:24.625 --> 28:27.166
We're the shit.
We're the shit. We are the shit.

28:27.167 --> 28:29.041
We are the shit.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.332
‐ You're alive!

28:30.333 --> 28:32.249
Oi, come on.
Give me back my pills.

28:42.583 --> 28:43.750
This is

28:45.167 --> 28:49.250
the greatest... night.

28:50.542 --> 28:51.958
Of my life.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.458
I wish I could just live out here forever.

29:03.958 --> 29:04.958
Follow me.

29:07.708 --> 29:08.916
What is it?

29:08.917 --> 29:11.207
Your ancestors are in there.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.457
‐ My ancestors are in there?

29:14.458 --> 29:18.041
‐ Your answers.
The answers you're looking for.

29:18.042 --> 29:19.499
‐ Okay.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.167
That's a totally different thing, but

29:24.708 --> 29:25.833
I'm in.

29:27.125 --> 29:30.208
You took too much.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.916
No, wait. Roy, wait, wait.

29:34.458 --> 29:36.207
Wait.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.750
That was a mistake.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.125
When Roy found out about his new life,
he did not take it lightly.

29:42.167 --> 29:44.374
Luckily, he lives in Irvine
and wakes up there every day,

29:44.375 --> 29:48.332
so he only comes around
once every few... days?

29:48.333 --> 29:51.499
Or weeks? I don't know.
My sense of time is a little fuzzy.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.999
‐ But what does he want?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.624
‐ I think he thinks it's revenge?

29:54.625 --> 29:57.332
Run, rabbit, run.

29:58.293 --> 30:00.124
‐ He may have some anger issues.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.792
You said you didn't want the day to end.

30:05.167 --> 30:06.958
What's that smell?

30:08.542 --> 30:09.749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:12.167 --> 30:16.541
So I vowed to never bring anyone
into this life ever again.

30:16.542 --> 30:18.249
‐ Amen to that.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.042
I tied my tubes at 40.

30:20.417 --> 30:22.166
‐ Yeah.
‐ You have to confront him.

30:22.167 --> 30:25.374
Right? I mean, you‐‐ you cannot
keep running from this person forever.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.583
What are you talking about?

30:29.375 --> 30:30.375
Of course I can.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.957
‐ Hey.
‐ Come on. Burrito truck just opened.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.332
That's for you. Keep the change, okay.

30:36.333 --> 30:38.958
But you have to promise me
you're gonna spend it all today.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.582
‐ You know that's a scam?
‐ Of course. Yeah.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.833
I just like to give back whenever I can.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.957
Material matters don't really concern me.

30:48.958 --> 30:50.499
‐ With the exception of booze and burritos

30:50.500 --> 30:52.082
and designer drugs and candy.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.624
‐ Obviously. I'm not a Puritan.

30:53.625 --> 30:54.999
‐ And sex, I assume?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.332
You fuck other people in here?

30:56.333 --> 30:57.541
‐ Great question.
‐ You must.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.499
Right?
‐ I have but

30:59.500 --> 31:01.249
it takes a lot of work,

31:01.250 --> 31:04.332
and I try to live my life at this point
with as little effort as possible.

31:04.333 --> 31:05.333
‐ Huh!

31:07.208 --> 31:08.332
Have we hooked up?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.417
‐ No. At least I don't think so.

31:11.458 --> 31:12.542
‐ So then, like, who else?

31:13.083 --> 31:15.292
‐ Right. Uh, well‐‐
‐ Besides Misty.

31:15.625 --> 31:16.583
‐ Daisy, the barkeep.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.582
‐ You know, I once had
a guy with this car.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.417
‐ Oh yeah?

31:24.042 --> 31:26.416
‐ I don't think he ever walked again.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.167
Darla.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.957
‐ If you insist.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.957
‐ I bet that was great.
‐ You would have bet right.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.291
‐ What about Tala?
‐ No.

31:35.292 --> 31:36.500
But I have tried.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.167
May I cut in?

31:41.042 --> 31:42.208
‐ It's the first dance.

31:43.042 --> 31:44.457
‐ And that's a deal‐breaker?

31:44.458 --> 31:46.416
‐ That didn't work?
‐ It was a big swing.

31:46.417 --> 31:48.207
‐ Right.
Who else?

31:48.208 --> 31:50.207
‐ Hey, hey!

31:50.208 --> 31:51.999
There you go?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.167
‐ You fucked Jerry Schlieffen?
‐ Well, he fucked me.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.041
He put his penis in my butthole.
‐ Yeah, I know how it works.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.833
‐ I'm really glad I tried it.
He's a sweet guy.

32:00.042 --> 32:01.042
‐ Nice shot.

32:01.042 --> 32:02.042
And that's it?

32:02.042 --> 32:03.042
That's all you got?

32:03.458 --> 32:04.458
‐ Oh,

32:05.375 --> 32:06.375
your dad.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.125
‐ What are we doing?

32:11.458 --> 32:12.541
‐ I don't know.

32:12.542 --> 32:13.500
No, I'm just kidding.

32:13.501 --> 32:14.957
‐ Oh my God.

32:14.958 --> 32:16.957
‐ Uh, I got you, though.
‐ You did.

32:16.958 --> 32:17.958
‐ What about you?

32:18.250 --> 32:19.500
What's going on with your sex life?

32:21.543 --> 32:23.000
‐ Nice try.
‐ Hmm?

32:24.583 --> 32:25.583
‐ I'm not gonna sleep with you.

32:25.584 --> 32:28.332
‐ I mean, you asked me about mine,
I was just being courteous.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.082
‐ I mean, I might have the other night,

32:30.083 --> 32:31.417
you know, I would have but‐‐

32:33.125 --> 32:34.291
Not now, though.
‐ Yeah!

32:34.292 --> 32:36.707
I was thinking
the exact same thing, you know.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.082
We'll be seeing each other all the time,
let's keep it simple.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.333
Don't over‐complicate it.
‐ Yeah.

32:43.625 --> 32:44.958
We've never had sex?

32:45.292 --> 32:47.582
Again, my memory is pretty shot,

32:47.583 --> 32:48.708
but I don't think so.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.374
Anyways, I think
the party's gonna start pretty soon.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.375
You wanna head back?

32:52.958 --> 32:53.958
‐ Is that a joke?

32:55.167 --> 32:57.291
No. Why would I do that?

32:57.292 --> 33:00.166
‐ I don't know. Eat, drink, dance.
Bask in love.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.207
‐ That is not love.
‐ Of course it is! Tala's in love.

33:02.208 --> 33:03.999
‐ No. You don't actually know
what you're talking about.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.416
We. You. Me. Everyone. Everyone we know.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.249
Nobody can stand the idea

33:09.250 --> 33:10.292
of being alone,

33:11.333 --> 33:15.791
so we... buy into this pageantry

33:15.792 --> 33:18.374
and celebrate its bullshit.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.832
‐ All right. So no wedding, then.

33:19.833 --> 33:20.958
Where do you wanna go?

33:22.708 --> 33:24.208
‐ Oh my God.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.957
Maybe it's a karma thing.

33:26.958 --> 33:28.291
‐ What is?
‐ Yeah.

33:28.292 --> 33:31.583
What if it's like to get out of this...

33:32.250 --> 33:34.332
you have to be selfless
and then you're free.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.666
‐ I just bought a hundred‐dollar candy bar
and I'm still here.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.041
‐ Yeah, but not like that.
Like real acts of selflessness,

33:39.042 --> 33:41.166
like the bone marrow shit
that Tala does, you know.

33:41.167 --> 33:44.374
Look, what if, oh my God, what if life
just keeps going for everyone else here

33:44.375 --> 33:46.332
but not you and me
until we've earned our way out?

33:46.333 --> 33:47.916
You've really never thought
about this before?

33:47.917 --> 33:49.874
‐ Yeah, no, I've never thought
about the multiverse.

33:49.875 --> 33:53.000
All right, fine, let's say you're right
and that would work,

33:53.708 --> 33:56.166
what's the most selfless act
you can think of?

33:56.167 --> 33:59.500
Something that would guarantee
this day to end.

34:02.625 --> 34:06.333
And I have full faith in your abilities

34:07.208 --> 34:09.625
to keep the boat...

34:10.292 --> 34:11.292
afloat.

34:12.375 --> 34:14.248
And now, old mate Abe...
‐ Oh, honey.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.916
Is gonna say his vows.

34:15.917 --> 34:18.833
‐ Actually, just‐‐
Sorry, hold on one second.

34:19.833 --> 34:20.958
You can take that.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.208
Are you joking right now?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.166
All right! Get down!

35:07.167 --> 35:09.167
Get down! Get down!

35:12.167 --> 35:13.541
Down! Hey! Hey!

35:13.542 --> 35:15.332
This place‐‐ Get off me!

35:15.333 --> 35:17.874
Get off me! I should never
have left the Great Lakes.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.541
This place is a nightmare.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.207
- Randy.
- It's all right, Randy.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.291
Everything is great.

35:22.292 --> 35:25.082
- Sorry.
- Uh, well, the gods have spoken,

35:25.083 --> 35:27.708
and they approve this marriage!

35:30.875 --> 35:32.374
‐ What the hell did you say to her?

35:32.375 --> 35:33.957
‐ Sister stuff. But I think I'm good.

35:33.958 --> 35:37.041
Selflessness is just... it's fantastic.

35:37.042 --> 35:38.042
‐ Right.

35:39.667 --> 35:42.167
‐ Uh‐oh, Alan, you owe me
a shot of whiskey.

35:44.792 --> 35:45.792
Alan.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.291
Well, Nyles, this has been great.

35:48.292 --> 35:51.207
Well, you know, not great,
but it's been interesting.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.208
And, hey, in all your future loops,

35:53.583 --> 35:57.082
please keep me out of that fucking cave.

35:57.083 --> 36:00.292
And good luck with that psychopath
who keeps trying to murder you.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.707
Thank you.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.583
Deal with him.

36:03.584 --> 36:05.333
‐ Yeah.
‐ That could be your way out.

36:05.917 --> 36:07.666
‐ Well, you seem
to have it all figured out.

36:07.667 --> 36:08.875
‐ Good luck.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.083
Coming!

36:12.500 --> 36:14.082
Oh, Sarah?

36:14.083 --> 36:17.083
‐ Didn't work. Life is meaningless.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.583
‐ Oh my God.

36:21.458 --> 36:22.541
Are you...

36:22.542 --> 36:23.833
fucking cheating on me?

36:24.792 --> 36:25.792
What?

36:26.458 --> 36:27.667
This isn't funny.

36:28.583 --> 36:29.792
Okay, stop.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.583
I'm serious.

36:31.917 --> 36:33.207
Stop copying me!

36:33.208 --> 36:35.332
Stop pretending like you know everything!

36:38.458 --> 36:40.625
‐ Okay, I'm gonna go.
‐ Wait, what?

36:41.167 --> 36:42.333
‐ And what is this place?

36:42.792 --> 36:45.374
‐ This is kind of a safehouse for me.

39:54.875 --> 39:56.124
There is a bomb in the cake.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.332
Don't worry.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.041
I used to be a bomb guy.

40:00.042 --> 40:01.375
Everyone stand back.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.249
‐ Oh my God!

40:06.250 --> 40:09.291
Foiled! You son of a bitch!

40:09.292 --> 40:10.832
You ruined my plan!

40:10.833 --> 40:11.957
Sarah.

40:11.958 --> 40:15.249
The sister of the bride
and based on her accent,

40:15.250 --> 40:17.249
from origins unknown.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.749
I'll take her dead or alive.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.666
‐ Put the weapon down.
‐ Fine.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.707
Then it's to be hand‐to‐hand combat then.

40:23.668 --> 40:25.333
Oh my God! Nyles!

40:25.708 --> 40:26.749
‐ How's it going? Is it good?

40:26.750 --> 40:28.207
‐ Yeah, looks really good.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.249
‐ And are the balls smooth
and hairless, like I asked for?

40:30.250 --> 40:31.791
‐ Yeah.
‐ And are you getting the jizz right?

40:31.792 --> 40:33.500
‐ Dotted lines. Straight across.

40:34.875 --> 40:35.917
‐ Ready?
‐ Yeah.

40:39.542 --> 40:41.208
‐ Ta‐da!

40:42.542 --> 40:43.667
‐ Wow!

40:44.083 --> 40:45.750
Thank you. That's beautiful.

40:46.458 --> 40:47.666
I'm not that old, though, am I?

40:49.250 --> 40:53.999
♪ Ulu Palakua continues ♪

41:05.125 --> 41:06.292
Think of it like this.

41:07.375 --> 41:09.583
Everything in this void

41:10.208 --> 41:12.082
the space where the candy bar once was

41:12.083 --> 41:14.083
but is now in my stomach,

41:14.667 --> 41:16.041
is the past.

41:16.042 --> 41:18.541
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And everything that's remaining

41:18.542 --> 41:20.874
is the future encased in chocolate.

41:20.875 --> 41:23.000
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I have no interest in this

41:23.583 --> 41:25.041
emptiness,

41:25.042 --> 41:28.166
you know, the who, what, why of your past.

41:28.167 --> 41:29.791
You got here, that's all that matters.

41:29.792 --> 41:32.167
‐ But if you really want to know
someone deeper, it does matter.

41:33.708 --> 41:34.708
It does.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.457
You have to know the whole package.

41:37.458 --> 41:38.666
‐ I disagree.

41:38.667 --> 41:41.042
This... the next bite,

41:43.833 --> 41:45.125
that's all that matters.

41:48.667 --> 41:50.042
‐ I was married for two years.

41:55.292 --> 41:56.667
I knew it wasn't going to work.

41:57.708 --> 41:59.749
I knew it wasn't going to work out
the moment that I said yes.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.207
I knew it wasn't going to work out
when I moved to Austin for him.

42:02.208 --> 42:04.625
I knew it wasn't going to work out

42:05.167 --> 42:07.083
as I walked down the aisle.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.625
But... I went through with it.

42:12.167 --> 42:13.792
And it didn't work out.

42:15.875 --> 42:19.000
Now... ignoring all that

42:20.667 --> 42:22.458
would make me destined to repeat it.

42:29.625 --> 42:30.625
What about you?

42:32.792 --> 42:33.792
‐ Hmm.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.958
You gonna tell me anything about‐‐

42:38.208 --> 42:39.374
‐ There's nothing.

42:39.375 --> 42:41.375
‐ What about your life
before you got stuck in here?

42:43.542 --> 42:44.542
What was your job?

42:54.958 --> 42:56.458
‐ I honestly can't remember.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.541
‐ Oh my God, that's bullshit, Nyles.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.042
‐ No, I'm serious.

43:01.959 --> 43:03.333
Wow, it's been

43:05.000 --> 43:06.292
such a long time.

43:14.875 --> 43:16.333
These are fantastic mushrooms.

43:20.750 --> 43:21.750
‐ Yeah.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.499
Too bad we're doing it
in such a shithole, though.

43:26.459 --> 43:28.542
I am not a fan of this magical desert.

43:29.250 --> 43:31.916
‐ Well,
then I just feel sorry for you.

43:31.917 --> 43:33.374
‐ Yeah?
‐ Uh‐huh.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.458
‐ Oh wow.

43:35.208 --> 43:36.999
Look, if you feel sorry for me,
then that must mean

43:37.000 --> 43:38.332
that you care about me, Nyles.

43:38.333 --> 43:39.333
‐ In what‐‐

43:40.000 --> 43:41.207
No.
‐ In what, what?

43:41.208 --> 43:43.499
‐ Wha‐‐ No. When I say that

43:43.500 --> 43:45.208
I feel sorry, it's like,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.457
it's the same way that I would say
that I feel sorry

43:48.458 --> 43:50.374
that, you know, I finished one beer,

43:50.375 --> 43:52.791
and now I have to open a new one.

43:53.668 --> 43:55.542
You know, now I'm not sorry anymore.

43:56.292 --> 43:58.500
It's just a fleeting feeling.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.875
‐ Right.
‐ It drifts away,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.125
just like, uh, they all do.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.333
‐ What do you mean,
"It just drifts away

44:11.417 --> 44:12.542
like they all do"?

44:14.792 --> 44:16.042
Like, what has drifted away?

44:26.250 --> 44:27.292
Everything.

44:32.708 --> 44:33.708
Anyways,

44:34.833 --> 44:35.917
cheers.

44:37.333 --> 44:38.833
‐ To pretending not to care.

44:40.417 --> 44:42.667
‐ I like that.
‐ I know you do.

44:43.625 --> 44:44.875
‐ To pretending‐‐

44:52.750 --> 44:54.167
That's new.

44:56.958 --> 44:58.417
‐ Oh my God.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.958
‐ Do you see them, too?

45:02.208 --> 45:03.417
Are they real?

45:04.750 --> 45:06.000
Who cares?

45:28.708 --> 45:29.708
Night.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.292
‐ Nyles.

45:43.833 --> 45:44.875
‐ Mm‐hmm.

45:45.667 --> 45:47.375
‐ Let's just get it over with.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.625
‐ Okay.

46:07.875 --> 46:09.166
Wait.
‐ What?

46:09.167 --> 46:10.500
What?

46:12.167 --> 46:13.541
‐ I just‐‐

46:52.958 --> 46:54.999
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

47:12.792 --> 47:14.417
‐ Hey, um,

47:15.250 --> 47:17.792
sorry, you, um, you‐‐
you should probably go

47:18.750 --> 47:20.250
you know, before somebody sees you.

47:44.917 --> 47:46.750
Sarah. Sarah?

47:47.417 --> 47:48.417
‐ Yeah.

47:53.792 --> 47:55.000
‐ Gotta say,

47:56.625 --> 47:57.625
kinda felt

47:58.958 --> 48:00.500
a little different this morning.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Like,

48:04.542 --> 48:06.333
you know, kinda good.

48:09.375 --> 48:10.542
'Cause of last night.

48:15.292 --> 48:16.292
‐ Oh yeah.

48:17.458 --> 48:18.458
Yeah.

48:20.417 --> 48:22.250
‐ Is that a "Yeah" of regret or‐‐

48:24.042 --> 48:25.416
‐ Yeah, it was fun.

48:25.417 --> 48:26.583
It was fun.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.625
‐ Yeah, sounds like it.

48:33.708 --> 48:35.667
‐ I can't keep waking up in here.

48:37.292 --> 48:39.292
‐ Yeah, the waking up is always weird,

48:39.917 --> 48:41.125
but, you know,

48:42.542 --> 48:44.832
going to bed maybe just got
a little better.

48:44.833 --> 48:47.499
Right?
‐ This cop's been following us

48:47.500 --> 48:48.500
for miles.

48:49.708 --> 48:51.000
- Oh.
- Right?

48:53.083 --> 48:55.082
‐ Do you wanna talk about it or‐‐
‐ The cop?

48:55.083 --> 48:58.291
‐ No, the fact that, um,
we had sex last night.

48:58.292 --> 49:00.749
You said we should have sex,
and then we had sex.

49:00.750 --> 49:01.833
‐ What's there to talk about?

49:03.750 --> 49:05.582
It's all meaningless, right?

49:05.583 --> 49:06.583
‐ I mean,

49:08.583 --> 49:10.458
I hope it's not all meaningless.

49:13.375 --> 49:14.874
‐ So what, we're just littering now?

49:14.875 --> 49:16.250
‐ God, nothing.

49:16.708 --> 49:18.374
What is this guy's deal?

49:26.458 --> 49:29.707
Oh, there we go. Finally.

49:29.708 --> 49:30.791
‐ What are you doing?

49:30.792 --> 49:33.249
‐ You know, believe it or not,
I've never been arrested before.

49:33.250 --> 49:35.958
Yeah, and I'm very curious to see
what it's all about. Aren't you?

49:36.375 --> 49:37.375
‐ No.

49:37.376 --> 49:39.374
No, no, no, no, don't.

49:39.375 --> 49:40.458
I think it might be him.

49:40.958 --> 49:42.208
‐ Him?
‐ Roy.

49:42.792 --> 49:45.083
Oh, that fucker!

49:47.833 --> 49:48.750
‐ Don't stop.

49:48.751 --> 49:51.374
‐ If you're not gonna take care of this,
someone has to.

49:51.375 --> 49:54.041
‐ No, someone doesn't have to!
We've been over this!

49:54.042 --> 49:55.458
I'm serious. I'm serious!

49:56.208 --> 49:57.500
‐ Help!

49:58.250 --> 50:00.749
He's trying to kill me!

50:01.917 --> 50:04.333
He's trying to kill me!

50:04.750 --> 50:06.582
He's trying to kill me!

50:06.583 --> 50:08.207
Sir, step out of the vehicle

50:08.208 --> 50:09.458
with your hands up.

50:09.833 --> 50:11.374
Thank you.

50:11.375 --> 50:12.917
Thank you.

50:13.458 --> 50:14.832
Is that him?

50:14.833 --> 50:16.541
Sir, if you do not comply,

50:16.542 --> 50:18.875
I'll have no choice
but to remove you by force.

50:24.917 --> 50:26.417
Uh, okay!

50:28.875 --> 50:30.083
I'm coming out!

50:34.000 --> 50:35.791
Sorry about that, Mr. Policeman,

50:35.792 --> 50:37.875
I thought you were someone else.

50:39.458 --> 50:42.208
Should always go
with that first instinct, shit bird.

50:48.500 --> 50:49.957
‐ Hi, Roy.

50:52.375 --> 50:54.082
Aahhh!

50:58.292 --> 51:00.000
You called for backup?

51:00.875 --> 51:02.749
‐ Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

51:02.750 --> 51:04.541
‐ Oh, come on, relax. I just, uh,

51:04.542 --> 51:05.542
I just clipped him.

51:05.543 --> 51:06.957
‐ You did not just clip him.

51:06.958 --> 51:08.457
‐ He's a fucking sadist.

51:08.458 --> 51:10.374
I‐‐ I was just saving you!
You should be thanking me.

51:10.375 --> 51:11.375
He was gonna kill you.

51:11.376 --> 51:12.791
‐ Okay, well, no, thank you.

51:12.792 --> 51:14.374
‐ Freeze! Put your hands above your head!

51:14.375 --> 51:16.249
‐ Suck my dick, Officer Bitch.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.791
‐ Seriously, man, just leave us alone.

51:17.792 --> 51:19.416
‐ Are you gonna
fucking Tase me, fuck face? Ooh?

51:19.417 --> 51:20.749
Ooh! Oh yeah, go ahead and Tase me.

51:20.750 --> 51:22.499
Come on, just do it.

51:25.458 --> 51:26.749
I'm touching your bike.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.375
Oh, uh‐oh, uh‐oh.

51:28.917 --> 51:30.624
Who the fuck is she?

51:30.625 --> 51:32.582
What the hell is going on with you?

51:32.583 --> 51:34.458
What?
It got a little out of hand.

51:36.167 --> 51:38.625
‐ You think.
‐ Sorry.

51:39.708 --> 51:41.207
‐ The pain is real.

51:41.208 --> 51:42.957
Why can't you understand that?

51:42.958 --> 51:45.374
‐ It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters. Right?

51:45.375 --> 51:47.499
Those are your words.
‐ No. Pain matters!

51:47.500 --> 51:49.416
What we do to other people matters!

51:49.417 --> 51:51.291
Being a source of terror is not fun, okay.

51:51.292 --> 51:54.082
It's not fulfilling.
I know this from experience.

51:54.083 --> 51:56.374
It doesn't matter that everything resets
and people don't remember.

51:56.375 --> 51:58.832
We remember. We have to deal
with the things that we do.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.457
‐ Oh my God. Cry me a river, Nyles.
You were never gonna deal with him.

52:01.458 --> 52:05.457
I actually did you a favor. So, fuck you.
‐ No, Sarah, fuck you.

52:05.458 --> 52:07.707
Out of nowhere,
you just start acting like a child,

52:07.708 --> 52:09.917
which, by the way, is how you got stuck
in this shit to begin with.

52:10.667 --> 52:12.457
Oww!
See? A child.

52:12.458 --> 52:14.124
Shut the fuck up over there!

52:14.125 --> 52:17.416
‐ I got stuck in this shit
because you got me stuck in it.

52:17.417 --> 52:19.249
‐ I tried to stop you.

52:19.250 --> 52:21.957
Or don't you remember.
I said, "Stop, don't come in."

52:21.958 --> 52:24.874
But no, you can't tell Sarah what to do.
She's got it all figured out.

52:24.875 --> 52:26.207
‐ Are you serious right now?

52:26.208 --> 52:28.332
I followed you into that cave
because I liked you

52:28.333 --> 52:30.124
and someone was trying to hurt you.

52:30.125 --> 52:31.916
Because I give a shit,

52:31.917 --> 52:34.791
which is something that
you clearly know nothing about.

52:34.792 --> 52:37.374
If I had known
that I was going to be stuck

52:37.375 --> 52:39.541
with a pretentious, sad bully

52:39.542 --> 52:41.666
for the rest of eternity,

52:41.667 --> 52:44.916
I would have stayed so far away from you,

52:44.917 --> 52:47.291
and I sure as hell
would never have fucked you.

52:47.292 --> 52:49.292
‐ Oh please, we've fucked
like a thousand times.

52:52.333 --> 52:53.625
‐ What?

53:00.208 --> 53:01.249
What did you say?

53:01.250 --> 53:03.250
‐ Wha‐‐ I didn't say‐‐
‐ Answer me.

53:09.917 --> 53:10.958
I lied, okay.

53:12.042 --> 53:13.791
We did hook up before.

53:13.792 --> 53:15.292
A lot.

53:16.167 --> 53:18.708
All I had to do was bail you out with
that ridiculous speech at the wedding.

53:20.042 --> 53:21.207
But it was different then.

53:21.208 --> 53:22.833
It was always just gonna reset.

53:23.833 --> 53:25.958
And then you got stuck in here and‐‐

53:27.125 --> 53:29.249
I don't know, maybe I should have
told you, but I didn't wanna tell you.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.042
I didn't wanna tell you!

53:35.083 --> 53:36.083
So I didn't.

53:37.042 --> 53:38.042
Okay.

53:44.583 --> 53:46.458
‐ I'm getting out of this day.

53:48.167 --> 53:50.457
‐ Look, Sarah, I'm sorry, okay.

53:50.458 --> 53:51.542
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah‐‐

54:02.000 --> 54:03.833
Hey. Pia.

54:04.750 --> 54:06.000
What room is Sarah staying at?

54:08.000 --> 54:09.582
Misty's boyfriend. Come on.

54:09.583 --> 54:11.541
‐ Oh, okay, right, right, sorry.

54:11.542 --> 54:13.542
Um, her room is second to last
down the hall.

54:14.083 --> 54:15.292
But she isn't in there.

54:15.917 --> 54:17.416
‐ Where is she?
‐ No one knows.

54:17.417 --> 54:20.042
Howard went to wake her up this morning,
but she wasn't in there.

54:26.250 --> 54:30.041
‐ So, did anyone actually see her
sleep in there last night?

54:30.042 --> 54:32.582
She wakes me up every morning, guys,
so she's got to be somewhere.

54:32.583 --> 54:34.707
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?
‐ Sarah!

54:34.708 --> 54:35.708
Come on out!

54:36.417 --> 54:38.000
Come on out!

54:38.500 --> 54:39.708
Wake up.

54:42.792 --> 54:43.917
‐ Sarah!

54:46.833 --> 54:47.833
Sarah!

54:51.375 --> 54:52.417
Wake up.

54:53.292 --> 54:56.207
‐ Sarah realized the day
wasn't about her so she left.

54:56.208 --> 54:57.624
‐ Oh, don't say that.

54:57.625 --> 54:59.166
‐ No, Howard.

54:59.167 --> 55:01.041
Once again, Pia is right.

55:01.042 --> 55:04.875
Sarah treats her life like
it's her own private soap opera.

55:05.250 --> 55:06.333
‐ Who are you?

55:07.833 --> 55:09.250
‐ Misty's boyfriend.

55:12.583 --> 55:13.583
Wake up.

55:13.584 --> 55:14.957
Where is she?

55:14.958 --> 55:17.166
Seriously, did she tell you guys
to do this.

55:17.167 --> 55:19.541
You didn't go in the cave,
but she told you to do this, right?

55:19.542 --> 55:21.374
‐ I don't‐‐ I don't feel safe
with him in the ho‐‐

55:21.375 --> 55:22.832
I feel like we should call the cops.

55:22.833 --> 55:24.666
‐ That's, like, honestly‐‐
‐ Sarah!

55:24.667 --> 55:26.124
‐ I don't feel safe anymore.

55:26.125 --> 55:28.082
And how gorgeous are these two?

55:28.083 --> 55:30.832
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, guys?

55:30.833 --> 55:31.999
Hmm.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.291
- We're so bad.
- Hmm.

55:33.292 --> 55:34.999
‐ Hold my leg up.
‐ Wake up.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.624
Airforce Reserves,
I ate three whole pizzas.

55:37.625 --> 55:38.874
Randy, you have the best stories.

55:38.875 --> 55:41.499
- I know.
- Hey!

55:41.500 --> 55:43.041
‐ Oh my God.

55:43.042 --> 55:45.875
The wedding guy's here.

55:47.167 --> 55:48.374
‐ Yeah.
‐ I need a breather.

55:48.375 --> 55:49.916
Can I, can I‐‐ ‐ Oh, please.

55:49.917 --> 55:51.332
Go for it. I brought it for you, man.

55:52.542 --> 55:54.583
Misty's boyfriend.
Are you in on this?

55:58.292 --> 56:00.292
That's a hard no. Okay. All right. Well,

56:00.667 --> 56:01.791
don't mind if I do.

56:01.792 --> 56:03.583
That's good, right?

56:08.333 --> 56:11.207
‐ Now he's married, man.
Watch him go back to the wedding.

56:11.208 --> 56:12.792
I never wanna be married.

56:13.917 --> 56:16.416
‐ You okay, dude?
‐ Did you two sleep in here last night?

56:16.417 --> 56:18.707
‐ No, Tala's all about that
no sleeping together

56:18.708 --> 56:20.582
before marriage thing, so Abe took it.

56:20.583 --> 56:21.583
Why?

56:21.584 --> 56:23.166
‐ Abe slept here last night?

56:23.167 --> 56:24.417
Yeah. What's up?

56:28.250 --> 56:29.542
‐ So fucking beautiful.

56:30.375 --> 56:33.374
‐ Abraham, you slick fuck, I get it.

56:33.375 --> 56:34.375
‐ Uh,

56:34.750 --> 56:37.333
excuse me.
‐ You and Sarah, it all makes sense now.

56:38.292 --> 56:39.457
‐ What's he talking about?

56:39.458 --> 56:41.416
Your sister and Abraham

56:41.417 --> 56:42.666
boned each other.

56:42.667 --> 56:44.750
‐ She wakes up with him every single day

56:45.167 --> 56:46.874
and then probably sneaks out
in the morning.

56:46.875 --> 56:48.832
God, no wonder she hates herself.

56:48.833 --> 56:49.708
Here, smell this.

56:49.709 --> 56:51.416
- From Abe's room.
- Shut up and sit down.

56:51.417 --> 56:53.332
You're drunk.
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?

56:53.333 --> 56:54.499
‐ Just shut up and go fuck Trevor.

56:54.500 --> 56:56.167
‐ That isn't true, is it?

56:56.833 --> 56:58.041
‐ What? No. No!

56:58.042 --> 56:59.582
This guy's been drunk all day.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.041
‐ That may be accurate.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.874
However, if you do smell the pillow,
you will recognize

57:03.875 --> 57:06.874
the distinct scent
of Orchid Explosion by Fournier,

57:06.875 --> 57:09.000
the hair mist you got for Sarah
on her birthday.

57:10.083 --> 57:13.874
Does anyone else here wear
Orchid Explosion by Fournier?

57:13.875 --> 57:14.875
‐ Oh my God.

57:15.750 --> 57:16.750
‐ I didn't think so.

57:17.625 --> 57:19.332
‐ Get the fuck out of here, okay.

57:19.333 --> 57:20.999
‐ Abe, let's take a walk.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.416
‐ You don't actually believe
this guy, do you?

57:22.417 --> 57:24.499
‐ You cheated on your fiancée
the night before your wedding

57:24.500 --> 57:25.791
with her sister?

57:25.792 --> 57:27.916
And you know what, fuck all of you.

57:27.917 --> 57:29.416
Sarah's a good person,

57:29.417 --> 57:31.957
but for some reason, she's never been
good enough for any of you‐‐

57:33.125 --> 57:34.166
Hey!

57:34.167 --> 57:36.042
Come here.

57:37.625 --> 57:39.333
‐ Stay back!
‐ What are you doing?

57:41.125 --> 57:43.332
‐ Try to ruin my life, huh?
Come on. Let's go.

57:44.875 --> 57:46.000
Ohh!

57:48.833 --> 57:51.333
‐ Misty's boyfriend!

57:54.500 --> 57:55.458
‐ Oh wow.

57:55.459 --> 57:57.124
‐ Oh my God, oh my God!

57:57.125 --> 57:59.082
Oh my God, is there a fork in my face?

58:08.458 --> 58:09.916
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to invite

58:09.917 --> 58:12.999
the mother and the father of the bride
for a one‐night special performance.

58:15.833 --> 58:16.833
Tala,

58:16.834 --> 58:19.042
you know that I'm not great
with words, but

58:20.250 --> 58:21.624
I do love you more than anything.

58:22.917 --> 58:25.166
So, we're going to perform a number

58:25.167 --> 58:28.332
that I sung to Howard
on our wedding night.

58:28.333 --> 58:30.707
It's a song that I want
you two to remember

58:30.708 --> 58:32.667
when you fall into hard times.

58:33.250 --> 58:34.792
Love can get you through anything.

58:35.542 --> 58:38.041
And this is A Lover's Concerto.

58:39.292 --> 58:42.083
♪ How gentle is the rain ♪

58:42.708 --> 58:46.666
♪ That falls softly on the meadow ♪

58:55.000 --> 58:56.292
‐ I miss her, Jerry.

58:57.083 --> 58:58.083
Who?

58:59.792 --> 59:02.208
‐ Sarah.
‐ Wilder?

59:03.542 --> 59:04.542
Oh.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.708
I didn't know you knew her.

59:14.458 --> 59:15.542
‐ I love her.

59:18.375 --> 59:19.375
‐ I see.

59:21.083 --> 59:22.249
That's interesting.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.416
Wake up.

59:56.208 --> 59:57.750
Roy!

59:58.417 --> 01:00:00.042
I'm turning myself in!

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:02.707
Torture me, I don't care!

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:04.124
‐ Motherfucker.

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.457
‐ You were right, it's dark down here!

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:07.957
‐ What the fuck are you doing here?

01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:09.416
‐ Hey, Roy.

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:11.750
I give up. You win.

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:14.917
It's okay, everybody.

01:00:14.918 --> 01:00:16.499
It's my nephew.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.957
Thanks for your concern.

01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:21.166
You cannot be here.

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.666
‐ Who was that man?
‐ Fuck!

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:23.832
‐ Oh.
‐ Hey, hon.

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.000
This is

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.207
‐ Nyles.
‐ Nyles

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:28.624
He's an old friend.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:32.083
Tuna will be ready soon,
and we'll be out back.

01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:40.457
You look sad.

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:42.042
Oh, he's okay, sweetie.

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:50.125
Twins.

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:53.042
Do you believe I made these at my age?

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.749
If I'd had one less Mai Tai that night,

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.125
I'd have put the condom on right,
and they wouldn't be here.

01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:02.208
So, here's to Mai Tais.

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:09.499
‐ So, this is your life?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500
‐ Not bad, huh?

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:11.917
Beautiful wife,

01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:13.958
beautiful kids.

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:18.417
Little Joey is watering dog shit.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.375
It's weird.

01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:24.249
But... it's beautiful.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.833
‐ What happened to marriage being
a "bottomless pit of sorrow"?

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.750
‐ Things change, you know.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:32.500
Priorities change.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.707
Okay, so what are you doing here?

01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:41.083
Just get on with it.
You're freaking my wife out.

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:45.125
‐ I don't know, I‐‐

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:48.207
I hadn't seen you in a while.
‐ Yeah, no shit.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.749
I ended up in the hospital
last time I saw you.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.708
Nurses wouldn't let me sleep.
They were afraid I'd go into a coma.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:56.458
‐ Nothing worse than dying slowly
in the ICU.

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:00.292
‐ I had a lot of anger towards you, man.

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:03.042
I mean,

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.333
I'm not going to see my kids grow up,

01:02:07.708 --> 01:02:09.875
never gonna walk little Libby
down the aisle.

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.874
I guess I had my head up my own ass.

01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:19.250
I mean, I didn't really

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:22.625
comprehend what I was putting you through.

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:28.000
That little stint in the hospital
really opened my eyes, though.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.583
This was always a good day here.

01:02:36.542 --> 01:02:37.542
You know.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.958
My wife in the prime of her womanhood.

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.792
Little Joey tending his dog shit.

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:48.791
Libby's gonna do a family portrait
later this afternoon

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:50.375
where we're all animals.

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:53.292
I'm a cuddly grizzly bear.

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.042
I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.417
You gotta find your Irvine.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.792
‐ I don't have an Irvine.

01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:09.125
‐ We all have an Irvine.

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.374
Hey, who was that loony bitch
that blindsided me

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.542
with the cop car, anyway?
‐ Don't call her that.

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.332
‐ You took her to the cave, didn't you?

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:22.457
Did you learn nothing from all this?

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:23.750
‐ She followed me in.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.292
‐ Well, at least you have each other.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.000
Nothing worse than going
through this shit alone.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.000
Okay, I think it's time for you to go.

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:47.792
‐ Can I stay for dinner?
‐ No, man, look, I‐‐

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:51.583
I think it's best
if we don't see each other anymore.

01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:54.417
It's not you, it's me.

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:02.083
‐ Could you kill me one more time?

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.833
You could still

01:04:06.458 --> 01:04:07.625
beat the traffic?

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:12.583
‐ All right. Side yard.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.917
I hope you find it, man.

01:04:19.583 --> 01:04:20.583
‐ Yeah.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.875
I'm getting out of this day.

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:36.916
‐ Look, Sarah, I'm sorry, okay.

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:38.000
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah‐‐

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.750
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:43.457
‐ Hey.
‐ Shut up.

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:44.624
That was awful and crazy

01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:46.000
and it should never have happened,

01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:49.499
and we both deserve
every single fucking terrible thing

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.041
that is coming toward us

01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:52.292
because we are very shitty people.

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.958
But... I am done being shitty.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.124
‐ Fuck.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:09.624
Wh‐‐ What did we do?
That was‐‐ that was so stupid

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.124
I'm a cheating piece of shit.

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:13.249
‐ Yeah, okay, great, I don't know.
‐ I'm like my dad!

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:07.166
‐ There's only one possible future
given the laws of our‐‐

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:09.124
‐ Yeah, but it would allow
an observer access

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:12.542
to the indeterministic universe
on the other side of the Cauchy horizon.

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:15.582
‐ Okay. Sounds like
you don't need my help.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.082
‐ You'll be okay.
You'll do just fine.

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:43.375
Wake up.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.375
‐ Hey.

01:06:55.542 --> 01:06:57.458
You're here?
‐ Yep.

01:06:58.958 --> 01:06:59.958
‐ Well,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.207
it's good to see you.

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:04.666
You look, you look great.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:06.667
‐ Yeah, well, I can't age.

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:09.957
Right.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.041
Let me in, Sarah.

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:13.707
You can't lock me
out of my own room.

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:14.708
Nyles!

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.500
Ugh!

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:18.625
‐ So, how have you been?

01:07:18.626 --> 01:07:20.292
‐ Ugh, so bad.

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:22.125
I mean,

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:26.207
No, yeah, really, really bad.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.375
Look, can I just say something?

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.792
I'm so sorry,

01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:34.207
for lying, for not telling you
about our past.

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:36.457
And I don't blame you for being mad at me

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:38.916
and staying away for so long.

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:41.166
But I've been thinking about it a lot,

01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:44.207
and I don't know, I feel like we had
something really good going

01:07:44.208 --> 01:07:46.042
before I screwed it up, you know.

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:51.083
So, do you think there's any way
we could just start over?

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:54.375
‐ Thank you.

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:57.708
Are you done?

01:07:58.083 --> 01:07:59.833
‐ Yeah.
‐ Cool.

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:02.125
So,

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.916
I think I found a way out.

01:08:04.917 --> 01:08:06.207
‐ Huh?

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.499
‐ We are trapped in a box of energy.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.917
We get out of it by escaping the box

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:14.707
in the 3.2 seconds it takes

01:08:14.708 --> 01:08:16.582
to travel through the loop itself.

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:21.166
‐ And by "escaping the box," you mean‐‐

01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:23.707
‐ We blow up ourselves
and the cave during that window.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:25.874
And if we detonate the C4
at the exact right moment,

01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:27.957
it will propel us

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.250
out.

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:31.917
‐ To where?

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.292
‐ I don't know.

01:08:33.292 --> 01:08:34.666
We could wake up, and it's today,

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.582
we could wake up,
and it's 20 years from now,

01:08:36.582 --> 01:08:38.666
or, you know, we could be dead

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:39.957
under a pile of rocks.

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.082
There's really no way to be sure,

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:44.000
that's why it's a theory.

01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:46.292
But we have to try.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:48.667
‐ Yeah, I guess.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:51.167
Do we, though? I mean,

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:54.082
I don't want you to set yourself up
for disappointment again.

01:08:54.082 --> 01:08:55.292
Remember the whole karma thing?

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:56.957
‐ This is different.

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:59.041
I tested it.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.707
‐ Tested it? How?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.624
‐ Spuds' goat. I sent her into the cave

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:04.916
and I, I blew her up.

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:07.457
I don't know where she went,
but she is not here anymore.

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:08.707
Can you zip me up?
‐ Wait.

01:09:08.707 --> 01:09:10.291
The goat is gone?

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:11.292
‐ Mm‐hmm.

01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:13.541
That's crazy, right?

01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:15.832
So, I think that we just get through
the rest of today,

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:17.749
we don't do anything too nuts,
and then tonight,

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.707
we peace the fuck out of this shithole.

01:09:20.667 --> 01:09:21.667
‐ Well‐‐

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:26.332
I mean, you sure you don't wanna run
some more tests or something?

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:27.999
‐ What? No. What are you talking about?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.374
‐ Well, it's just
the cave's not going anywhere.

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:30.874
What's the big rush, you know,

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.000
in case something
actually does happen?

01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:36.582
‐ Holy shit.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:38.832
Are you scared to leave?

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:40.500
‐ What? No.

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:42.582
Not at all.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:45.666
I just don't want to leave.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:47.666
There's a difference.
‐ Oh yeah? What's the difference?

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:49.917
‐ I wanna stay with you.

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:52.957
Look, I love you, okay.

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.042
How about that?

01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:57.417
‐ What?

01:09:58.125 --> 01:09:59.125
‐ I love you.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:03.208
You‐‐

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.000
How can you even know that?

01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:09.166
I'm literally the only other human being
stuck in here with you.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:10.707
‐ No. What about Roy? I don't love him.

01:10:10.708 --> 01:10:12.000
‐ Oh my God. Nyles.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.083
I‐‐ So you, you're,

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.124
you are saying that out there,
in the real world,

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:19.082
with millions of other people
to choose from,

01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:21.124
you would still choose me?
‐ Yeah.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:24.082
But why would I want
to go back there anyway, you know.

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:25.541
It's a world with death and poverty,

01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:27.707
debilitating emotional distress.

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.249
At least in here, we get to be together.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:31.500
‐ You have lost your mind.

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:36.082
‐ Is that so bad?
That's what love is all about!

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.374
Don't be so afraid of it.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.124
‐ This isn't real, Nyles.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:41.874
Everything that we are doing in here
is fucking meaningless.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:42.958
‐ So what?

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:45.750
I mean, it's not like things were going
so great for you out there.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:51.457
Look, I know about you and Abe, okay.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:52.832
And if your plan works,

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:54.958
that's a whole other mess
you're gonna have to deal with.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.167

But it doesn't matter!

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:07.417
I don't care about that stuff.
That's like my whole thing.

01:11:09.667 --> 01:11:11.416
‐ I can't keep waking up in there.

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:12.750
‐ Just ignore it.

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.667
‐ I need my life back.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:18.167
And I am asking you

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.208
if you want to leave this place

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:23.541
and come with me.

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:25.042
‐ And I'm saying no.

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:28.208
But I'm also asking you to stay.

01:11:42.708 --> 01:11:43.999
‐ Goodbye, Nyles.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.374
‐ What?

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:46.625
Sarah.

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:55.542
‐ Nyles, what the fuck was that?

01:11:58.542 --> 01:11:59.708
‐ We should break up.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.499
‐ What?
‐ You don't like me.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.583
‐ I don't like you,

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.792
but I don't think we should break up.

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:08.417
‐ What?
‐ People don't break up with me.

01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:10.791
This is so fucked up.

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:12.749
‐ Okay.
‐ I'm breaking up with you.

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:14.207

the actual maid of honor,

Thank you, Misty.

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:52.166
Um, when I was 12,

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.791
I had just started at this new school

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:57.249
and I was truly terrified of the world,

01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:01.917
and, uh, I kept having these
really awful nightmares.

01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:05.375
And then one morning I woke up
after a full night of sleep.

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:08.000
And I find Tala

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:10.125
asleep next to me,

01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:11.583
holding me.

01:13:13.292 --> 01:13:14.874
She'd heard me crying in my sleep,

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:19.333
and... she... crawled into my bed
to snuggle me

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.207
because she thought that might help.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:24.208
And she was, like, five years old.

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:27.458
And I never had another nightmare.

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.792
Uh, you have this

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:35.624
selflessness and this hopefulness

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:38.208
that's really... special.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.625

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.624

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500

So, hopefully you get this
and sorry about that, again.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.042

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:17.207
A ride, anything.

01:17:17.208 --> 01:17:18.250
‐ Who the fuck are you?

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:22.082
‐ Thirty years ago, you met
a woman named Tracy Holmes

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:23.541
at a bar in Aberdeen.

01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:26.166
She took your virginity in the bathroom
and then left town.

01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:27.333
You never saw her again.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:29.250
Spuds,

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:31.750
I'm your son.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.125
‐ I always had a feeling.

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.832
Sarah!

01:17:48.833 --> 01:17:50.000
Sarah, wait!

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:51.583
Wait!

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:55.166
I get it now. You were right.

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:56.333
I was scared,

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:58.792
but I'm not anymore!

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:00.292
Look, Sarah,

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:02.457
from the first time that I saw you‐‐

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.957
‐ No, stop. Stop it.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.625
Nyles, I don't, I don't want
another one of your speeches,

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.333
all right.

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:17.874
You get one more sentence.

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:18.875
‐ Okay.

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:20.458
Okay.

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:23.000
Even though I pretend not to be,

01:18:23.667 --> 01:18:26.208
I've realized that
I'm completely co‐dependent,

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:27.999
but I'm cool with it

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.250
because I think that
life should be shared now,

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.583
and I need you to survive.

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:36.625
‐ Okay.

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.833
That's your one sentence.
‐ I need you to survive, comma,

01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:42.250
but it's so much more than that...

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.000
uh, colon.

01:18:45.543 --> 01:18:47.917
I know you better than anyone knows you.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.499
And remember that night
we saw the dinosaurs,

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.374
you said it yourself,
in order to really know a person

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:55.499
you have to see the entire package,
the good and the bad,

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.042
and I've seen your package,
and it is excellent, Sarah.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.250
Ampersand.

01:19:01.292 --> 01:19:03.250
You're my favorite person
that I've ever met,

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:06.957
and, yes, I know that it's crazy odds

01:19:06.958 --> 01:19:09.291
that the person I like the most
in my entire life

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:11.082
would be someone I met
while I was stuck in a time loop,

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:12.332
but you know what else has crazy odds?

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:14.000
Getting stuck in a time loop.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.291
Dot, dot, dot‐‐

01:19:16.292 --> 01:19:17.749
‐ Ellipses.
‐ Ellipses, thank you.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:18.791
‐ It's called an ellipses.

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:20.417
‐ Ellipses, look,

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:24.624
I hope that blowing ourselves up works,

01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:27.249
but it's really irrelevant to me

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:28.583
as long as I'm with you.

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:31.208
And if it kills us, well then

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:36.000
I'd rather die with you

01:19:36.625 --> 01:19:38.208
than live in this world without you,

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.083
emphatic period.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:48.582
‐ That was a grammatical nightmare.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.541
‐ Yeah, I'm hoping it didn't distract
from my point too much.

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:53.957
‐ I mean, an emphatic period is just a‐‐
it's just an exclamation point.

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.125
‐ I didn't want to seem desperate.

01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.458
‐ What if we get sick of each other?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.958
‐ We're already sick of each other.

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:07.625
It's the best.

01:20:12.417 --> 01:20:14.958
‐ I can survive just fine
without you, you know.

01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:19.292
But there‐‐ there's

01:20:20.042 --> 01:20:23.208
a chance that this life can be
a little less mundane

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:25.458
with you in it.

01:20:26.292 --> 01:20:27.292
‐ Yeah.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:28.833
Less mundane.

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:31.958
That's a super low bar.
That's a great place to start.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:37.333

‐ Okay.
