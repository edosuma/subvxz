ASSOCIATION MEMBER:
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

20:39.099 --> 20:40.279
-Time out.
-Before we raffle this,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.130
make sure all the garbage
is off in the garbage can.

20:43.150 --> 20:45.039
Let's do that now
before we raffle it,

20:45.059 --> 20:46.269
because then you guys are gonna
run out of here

20:46.289 --> 20:48.000
and everybody else cleans.

20:48.019 --> 20:50.049
JOHN: I was stunned to learn
that the refs

20:50.069 --> 20:53.009
could not even be trusted
to clean up after themselves

20:53.029 --> 20:56.029
unless they were bribed
with a flatscreen TV.

20:56.049 --> 20:59.019
ORGANIZER: Don't leave anything
on the table or on the floor!

20:59.039 --> 21:01.180
We're not here to clean up,
please.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.000
JOHN: After the room
was deemed clean enough

21:04.019 --> 21:06.220
and the winner
was finally announced...

21:06.240 --> 21:09.250
Five-nine-four.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.049
SHERMAN: Five-nine-four!

21:11.069 --> 21:12.210
RAFFLE ANNOUNCER:
Five-nine-four!

-SHERMAN: Five-nine-four!
-(CROWD GROANING)

21:14.099 --> 21:15.259
JOHN:
The room erupted into chaos

21:15.279 --> 21:18.119
when everyone discovered,
uh, the prize was going to

21:18.140 --> 21:21.220
a high-ranking affiliate
of the association.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.109
-The refs started booing...
-Boo!

21:24.130 --> 21:27.049
JOHN: ...because they suspected
the draw had been rigged.

21:27.069 --> 21:29.130
People started yelling fraud.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.019
-Fraud!
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:32.029 --> 21:33.089
JOHN: But unfortunately,

21:33.109 --> 21:35.289
the allegations only seemed
to arouse him.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.049
Petty theft
increased dramatically.

21:41.069 --> 21:43.279
And when a gold-plated whistle
was awarded to the guy

21:44.000 --> 21:46.119
who had been yelling
at everyone the whole night,

21:46.140 --> 21:48.210
it seemed to be the--
the final straw.

21:48.230 --> 21:50.269
PRIZE GIVER: Smile for camera.
Smile for the camera.

21:50.289 --> 21:53.069
Camera's over here.
Smile for the camera.

21:53.089 --> 21:55.049
-Smile for that camera.
-(LAUGHS)

21:55.069 --> 21:56.160
Smile for that camera.

21:56.180 --> 22:00.079
JOHN: And everyone left
almost instantly, as predicted.

22:01.190 --> 22:03.140
But as people were filing out,

22:03.160 --> 22:07.059
the guy that won the golden
whistle seemed very upset.

22:07.079 --> 22:08.250
It appeared
that his golden whistle

22:08.269 --> 22:13.250
was actually stolen straight,
uh, from the display case.

22:13.269 --> 22:16.140
It-- It was stolen.
His golden whistle was stolen.

22:17.140 --> 22:20.000
He was really hoping
that it was a joke,

22:20.019 --> 22:23.000
but after about a half an hour,
it didn't seem like

22:23.019 --> 22:26.009
it was gonna be
reappearing anytime soon.

22:27.150 --> 22:30.079
So I left the ref dinner
with a heavy heart.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.109
I guess I was wrong in assuming

22:33.130 --> 22:36.289
that refs would be less flawed
than the rest of us.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.150
And if that's the case,

22:39.170 --> 22:42.069
then what hope do we have
to act with any civility

22:42.089 --> 22:44.130
when we're out with our friends?

Stealing from anybody

they need to steal
