41:04.330 --> 41:08.040
Thanks to the courage of
some very brave individuals,

41:08.040 --> 41:10.080
it has come to my attention

41:10.080 --> 41:14.170
that,
for the last 30-odd years,

41:14.170 --> 41:18.120
our country has been led,
not by our President,

41:18.120 --> 41:21.710
but by a top-secret
spy organization

41:21.710 --> 41:26.670
operating within our government
on our government's dime...

41:26.670 --> 41:29.500
-No, no, no, no, no.
-...in our government's name.

41:29.500 --> 41:30.920
These are the traitors

41:30.920 --> 41:33.330
who tried to bring down
Air Force Two.

41:33.330 --> 41:35.500
These are the traitors
who seek to frame

41:35.500 --> 41:37.170
Mellie Grant for that crime.

41:37.170 --> 41:40.670
These are the traitors
Mr. Lonnie Mencken,

41:40.670 --> 41:42.420
who should be dragged
out of the darkness

41:42.420 --> 41:43.750
and into the light

41:43.750 --> 41:47.000
so they can finally be held
accountable.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.920
It will not be easy.

41:49.920 --> 41:53.040
The enemy is formidable,

41:53.040 --> 41:55.920
but it is necessary,

41:55.920 --> 41:58.830
for this is the fight
of our time.

41:58.830 --> 42:00.830
Stand with me, Lovers.

42:00.830 --> 42:03.540
Demand justice, take action.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.080
God bless you, Lovers,

42:05.080 --> 42:08.210
and God bless America,

42:08.210 --> 42:11.120
or at least what's
left of it.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.920
Here we go.
