17:55.500 --> 17:56.200
WORLD, CIRCLES --

17:57.133 --> 17:57.633
>> GEE!

17:57.633 --> 17:59.300
>> IN THE U.S., WE ONLY FOCUS ON

17:59.300 --> 18:00.833
A HURRICANE THAT HITS, AND IT

18:00.833 --> 18:02.167
SEEMS LIKE IT'S A FLUKE,

18:02.167 --> 18:03.633
ONE-IN-A-CENTURY HURRICANE.

18:03.633 --> 18:04.600

18:16.667 --> 18:18.400
MASSIVE WEIGHT ON THE EARTH'S

18:18.400 --> 18:19.567
CRUST IS REDUCED.

18:19.567 --> 18:20.867
>> THAT'S GONNA HURT.

18:22.067 --> 18:22.967
>> WHAT THE?

18:22.967 --> 18:24.567

GLACIER NATIONAL PARK WILL BE

18:34.067 --> 18:35.467
GONE.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.933
OUR OZONE DEPLETION AND OUR

18:56.933 --> 18:58.200
POLLUTION CONTENT IN OUR

18:58.200 --> 18:59.900
ATMOSPHERE IS GOING TO INCREASE

18:59.900 --> 19:00.467
TENFOLD.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.067
>> THIS AUDIENCE MUST BE LIKE,

19:02.067 --> 19:04.400
"THIS GUY IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE."

19:04.400 --> 19:05.633
>> LET'S MOVE ON.

19:05.633 --> 19:06.467

19:06.467 --> 19:07.267
>> OKAY.

19:07.267 --> 19:08.567
>> I GOT A FRIEND.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.767

19:10.767 --> 19:12.067
THEY SAY THAT...

19:12.067 --> 19:13.133
>> OH, MY GOD.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.300
>> UH, THE GLOBAL SEA LEVEL HAS,

19:16.300 --> 19:19.367
UH, RISEN BY NINE INCHES.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.500
WHAT?

19:20.500 --> 19:22.867
>>

19:22.867 --> 19:24.100
>> HI.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.433
>> OH, MY GOD!

19:32.967 --> 19:34.167
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT CLIMATE --

19:34.167 --> 19:35.233
DAILY ACTIVITIES THAT COULD

19:35.233 --> 19:36.167
AFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE.

19:36.167 --> 19:36.867
>> THERE YOU GO.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.867
NICE JOB, BUDDY. NICE JOB.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.100
>> IF YOU HAD BOUGHT LOCAL

19:40.100 --> 19:40.700

JOEY.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.067
YEAH, YEAH.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.367

19:44.367 --> 19:45.933
>> THE CHANGE THAT THAT WOULD

19:45.933 --> 19:46.533
CAUSE...

19:46.533 --> 19:48.200
>> HEY, MURR, WHY DON'T YOU JUST

19:48.200 --> 19:49.867
TAKE A STROLL FROM BEHIND THAT

19:49.867 --> 19:50.400
PODIUM?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.133
>> IF YOU HAD JUST CHOSEN TO EAT

19:52.133 --> 19:53.700
LOCAL AND TO BUY LOCAL, THAT

19:53.700 --> 19:55.067
CHANGE WOULD BE DRAMATIC.

19:57.333 --> 20:01.700
>> YES, YES!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.333
YES!

20:03.333 --> 20:04.400
>> CHANGE IS A-COMING.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.800
BETTER MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT

20:05.800 --> 20:07.067
KIND OF CHANGE.
