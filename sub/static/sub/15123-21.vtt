WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.105
Whoo!

00:04.172 --> 00:05.339
* Here we go *

00:05.406 --> 00:08.642
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! *

00:17.918 --> 00:20.154
Jimmy, show's about to start.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.856
Made your favorite, shark melon.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.359
No, I'm not watching it!

00:26.960 --> 00:28.462
Ooh, it's
almost show time.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.331
How in the world did
you get that guy

00:30.398 --> 00:31.765
to let you tap into his cable?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.102
I thought he hated you
because you barked at him.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.436
I don't bark at him.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.106
I bark back at
his annoying barking dog.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.207
And screw that guy.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.008
He didn't let me
tap into his cable.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.843
I stole it.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.180
He's always over there
barbequing his delicious meat,

00:46.247 --> 00:48.282
never inviting us over.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.683
That smell drives me crazy.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.052
He should put up
a smell wall or something.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.354
We could put one up.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.055
You know how expensive
a good smell wall is?

00:55.123 --> 00:57.125
Jimmy, your dad's
hooking up the TV!

00:57.191 --> 00:58.726
You're going to miss it!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.961
I'm not watching it!

01:01.028 --> 01:02.130
Jimmy, we captured
a serial killer.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.264
That's all they're
going to show.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.765
That's all anyone cares about.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.368
Do you think if they showed
the embarrassing things we do

01:07.435 --> 01:10.138
every single week,
anyone would want to watch that?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.273
Got it!

01:18.412 --> 01:22.049
Hello, I'm Nancy Grace filling
in for Geraldo Rivera,

01:22.116 --> 01:23.984
who is recovering from some

01:24.051 --> 01:25.786
pretty substantial
plastic surgery.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.590
Tonight, Inside Probe
travels to Natesville.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.793
Normally a simple place
where people work all day,

01:32.860 --> 01:36.397
come for dinner, then enjoy
eating snacks on the sofa

01:36.464 --> 01:38.699
and watching shows like this.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.069
NANCY GRACE: But tonight,

01:42.136 --> 01:45.105
we probe inside
Natesville to explore

01:45.173 --> 01:46.974
one of its dark secrets.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.210
A small-town murder spree...

01:49.277 --> 01:50.744
I stopped going out at night.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.147
I mean, mostly because I didn't
have friends or money,

01:53.214 --> 01:54.982
but, I mean, the
murder thing didn't help.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.684
GRACE: A family, terrorized!

01:56.750 --> 01:58.352
The killer was right there
in our kitchen.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.221
He had eaten one of
my wife's special egg dishes.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.323
"Ham-and-eggtapusses."

02:04.358 --> 02:07.027
With a capture
and a shocking ending

02:07.094 --> 02:08.396
not to be believed.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.930
I had to do something.
She seduced my son.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.966
She would have killed him for
sure. I would have lost my baby.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.235
My baby! (sobbing)

02:14.302 --> 02:17.305
It's all tonight,
on Inside Probe.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.573
(show theme playing)

02:28.549 --> 02:31.185
I walking and talking
at Howdy's Market

02:31.252 --> 02:32.786
in the heart of Natesville.

02:32.853 --> 02:37.157
A friendly place, where
one out of every two customers

02:37.225 --> 02:41.028
shop for groceries
while riding on Rascals.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.398
But, April 9, 2008,

02:44.465 --> 02:48.202
there was a very different kind
of Rascal at Howdy's.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.505
A Rascal known as a murderer.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.941
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

02:54.007 --> 02:56.610
GRACE: Sabrina Collins...

02:57.845 --> 03:00.748
(whispers):
Do you want me to keep going?

03:00.814 --> 03:03.217
GRACE: She wanted to grow up
to be a movie star

03:03.284 --> 03:05.185
or a zoologist.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.555
But she ended up
as a checkout girl.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.958
The last thing she thought
she'd be checking out though

03:11.024 --> 03:12.926
was a dead body.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.062
The body was
in the Dumpster.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.997
Was it all bloody?
Was it gross?

03:17.064 --> 03:18.198
Yeah, it was gross.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.868
Oh, my God. Uh, uh,
did you touch it?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.035
What was the smell?

03:22.102 --> 03:24.004
It was bad.
It smelled bad.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.806
Oh-oh-ohh, man!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.777
When you sign up to be
an auxiliary policeman,

03:29.843 --> 03:31.812
You know you're going
to work some crowd control.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.415
Host the Annual Pancake
Breakfast, maybe work the

03:34.482 --> 03:36.183
Say-No-To-Drugs Puppet
for the kids.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.618
Don't smoke crack.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.420
But you never think
you're going to get

03:39.487 --> 03:42.022
a big opportunity
to shine, but I did.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.957
What do you mean
"calm down"?!

03:44.024 --> 03:46.527
When are you sending me some
backup?! Andy, the guy's dead!

03:46.594 --> 03:50.431
Game over, man!
Game over! (sobbing)

03:50.498 --> 03:53.667
That first murder
was pretty big news.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.836
I mean, we don't get
a lot of crime around here.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.472
Someone stole the giant donut
in front of the Taco Hut

03:58.539 --> 03:59.840
that used to be
the donut place.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.344
But other than that, it's
usually pretty crime-free.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.413
GRACE: Virginia Slims Chance,

04:05.479 --> 04:07.381
named by a desperate mother

04:07.448 --> 04:11.285
in a futile attempt to get
a free carton of cigarettes.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.321
A girl of simple tastes,

04:13.387 --> 04:15.389
little things made her happy:

04:15.456 --> 04:18.359
a snow man, a gerbil
named Martha,

04:18.426 --> 04:20.761
learning to spell "s" words.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.396
But in 2008,

04:22.463 --> 04:26.567
a string of murders made
her life very complicated.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.202
I was immediately "inquizical"
of this mystery.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.040
I watch a lot of CSI, SVU, NCIS.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.076
If a show's got letters in it,
I am so there.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.278
Psst!

04:38.346 --> 04:39.747
Hey!

04:39.813 --> 04:41.782
What?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.785
Have you seen
my sunglasses?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.388
I want to take
the lenses out

04:47.455 --> 04:50.057
so I look smart
in my interview.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.260
GRACE: Virginia's husband,
Burt Chance.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.497
Born Engelburt Jebadiah Chance,

04:56.564 --> 04:58.932
Burt enjoyed
pretending to read,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.535
trying on hats,
and the outdoors.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.738
One summer,
he and his dog, Burt,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.507
tried to run away from home

05:06.574 --> 05:09.343
by floating on
a mattress down the river.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.613
I was quite concerned.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.247
(dog barking nearby)
I have really good skin,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.950
and my biggest fear is
that someone will cut me up

05:17.017 --> 05:19.720
(louder barking)
and make a Burt suit.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.622
Pardon me.

05:21.689 --> 05:26.360
Bark, bark, bark, bark,
bark, bark, bark, bark!

05:26.427 --> 05:27.795
Uh, excuse me.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.398
Uh, you guys just shoot
from the waist up, right?

05:30.464 --> 05:33.166
'Cause, I can't find
my good pants.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.369
GRACE: Virigina and Burt's son,

05:35.436 --> 05:38.005
James Bon Jovi Chance.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.673
Born to teenage parents,

05:39.740 --> 05:42.142
he carried on
their tradition of partying,

05:42.209 --> 05:44.177
as seen in this picture of him

05:44.244 --> 05:46.914
during his first breast-milk
hangover.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.983
He got into Goth
before it was cool

05:50.050 --> 05:53.821
and continued on
long after it was cool.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.023
I mean, if the murders
were happening to me,

05:56.089 --> 05:57.190
yeah, I'd be scared.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.060
But they were happening
to other people, so...

06:00.127 --> 06:02.195
If Jimmy Chance wasn't worried,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.831
the rest of the town was.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.933
One murder turned into three.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.736
And police started
to detect a pattern.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.038
Just go around me!
(scoffs)

06:11.104 --> 06:12.706
So we figured out
that all the victims

06:12.773 --> 06:14.942
had a mysterious girlfriend
that no one could find.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.745
By "we," I mean the
investigation team.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.548
That's when I suggest we call
this mysterious woman

06:20.614 --> 06:21.882
the Boyfriend Killer.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.883
Hm.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.485
All the guys
on the team loved it.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.819
Derek gave me this pin.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.489
He said I could pick any
of the ones in his drawer.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.958
It was the last one
with an eagle on it.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.259
Nice.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.496
I only wear it on special
occasions, TV interviews,

06:35.563 --> 06:37.498
when I go visit my two moms,

06:37.565 --> 06:39.266
or every third Friday
when we have our

06:39.332 --> 06:40.367
employee morale-boosting

06:40.434 --> 06:41.969
original song karaoke nights.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.004
* Who at Howdy's
loves their jobs? *

06:44.071 --> 06:45.839
* We do, we do. *

06:45.906 --> 06:47.941
* How long do we
all work hard? *

06:48.008 --> 06:49.810
* All the live-long day. *

06:49.877 --> 06:52.513
* Instrumental... *

06:52.580 --> 06:54.648
(music continues)

06:56.283 --> 06:58.619
Those murders were awesome.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.754
I mean, not for
the dudes that got killed,

07:00.821 --> 07:02.856
There were tons
of lonely chicks out there,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.926
'cause guys were two scared to
be dating the Boyfriend Killer.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.961
But I know karate.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.597
(grunting)

07:15.402 --> 07:17.170
These are some of the
ladies I dated.

07:17.237 --> 07:21.174
I didn't have horizontal
refreshments with all of them,

07:21.241 --> 07:23.243
But I did get lots of pictures.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.745
I was pulling more tail than

07:24.812 --> 07:27.748
a curious three-year-old
in a petting zoo.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.850
GRACE: Police soon had
a woman in custody

07:29.917 --> 07:31.418
confessing to the crimes.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.587
You bet your ass I did it.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.855
I killed all of them.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.124
GRACE: Barbara June Thompson,

07:37.190 --> 07:38.659
former Miss Natesville.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.961
She became a
professional model,

07:41.028 --> 07:42.963
starting out in bathing suits

07:43.030 --> 07:45.032
and ending up
in straightjackets.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.299
(cuckooing)

07:46.366 --> 07:50.838
I also killed Kennedy,
Lincoln, and the last dodo bird.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.873
Clearly, Barbara June
was insane,

07:52.940 --> 07:54.842
and police had the wrong woman.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.943
Disco.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.244
I killed disco.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.680
It looked like the murderer
would continue killing

07:59.747 --> 08:02.916
until all the boyfriends
in Natesville were gone,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.953
and she had to start killing
"friends with benefits,"

08:06.019 --> 08:09.156
until this call
was received by 911.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.658
OPERATOR: 911,
what's your emergency?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.092
VIRGINIA: This is
Virginia Chance.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.528
Virginia, this is
your fourth call this month.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.163
For the last time,
we don't

08:16.229 --> 08:17.798
handle rotten pumpkin disposal.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.900
No wait, we actually do
have an emergency.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.434
We captured
the Boyfriend Killer!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.804
BURT: Ask her about the pumpkins
while you're on the line.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.807
How did the Chance's capture
Cold-Blooded Killer?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.842
To answer that question,

08:28.909 --> 08:33.747
prepare yourself for a magic
voyage into the wonderful world

08:33.814 --> 08:36.216
of cheap Korean animation.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.285
Jimmy Chance took his van
to pick up

08:38.351 --> 08:40.754
some bubble gum ice cream
and ended up

08:40.821 --> 08:43.356
getting a double scoop
of trouble.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.827
That's when Lucy appeared
begging for help.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.729
Thinking he was being
a good Samaritan,

08:48.796 --> 08:52.900
Jimmy scooped her up
and drove her to safety.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.102
You saved my life
and you are cute.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.637
Make sex with me.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.606
This is fantastic.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.307
GRACE: The van started rockin',

09:00.373 --> 09:03.877
and neighbors knew
not to come knockin'.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.279
Jimmy get out here!
You're missing it.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.248
This show has cartoons.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.283
What kind of cartoons?

09:10.350 --> 09:14.021
GRACE: Lucky for the Chances,
Lucy had to make ploppies,

09:14.087 --> 09:16.523
and she excused herself
to the bathroom.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.492
It was during these ploppies,
that the news informed

09:19.559 --> 09:23.163
the Chances that Lucy
was a wanted murderer.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.399
Upon Lucy's return
from making ploppies,

09:26.466 --> 09:28.769
Virginia grabbed the family TV

09:28.836 --> 09:31.872
and bam!
Good night, scumbag.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.507
I got to admit, this isn't
what I thought it would be.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.943
See, we had nothing
to worry about.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.377
They're making us
look like heroes.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.946
GRACE: A family of heroes.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.681
Ha-ha.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.916
Or, so it would appear
from the outside.

09:42.983 --> 09:43.951
Uh-oh.

09:44.017 --> 09:47.387
That's why we decided
to probe deeper.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.023
Even when the story says no,

09:50.090 --> 09:53.526
we probe deeper
until the story likes it.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.329
I told you, I didn't
want to talk about this.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.331
This interview,
it's-it's over!

09:58.398 --> 10:00.668
And I was going to
do my Gollum imitation

10:00.734 --> 10:01.769
from Lord Of The Rings.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.070
(à la Gollum): Your loss!

10:03.136 --> 10:05.572
Your loss!

10:05.639 --> 10:06.840
(sobs)

10:06.907 --> 10:08.408
They're going to show it!

10:08.475 --> 10:10.978
You said this would be
a flattering portrayal.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.081
Liar, liar, pantsuit on fire!

10:14.147 --> 10:17.885
Oh! Got busted
for stealing the cable!

10:21.088 --> 10:24.157
You people are such trash.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.099
What the hell?!

10:32.165 --> 10:33.967
You people think you can
just steal our cable?!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

10:35.102 --> 10:37.237
What do you mean, you people?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.872
We just want to borrow
your cable tonight.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.808
Yeah, you got
the wrong idea, Tom.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.775
We don't steal.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.010
Just like you don't cheat on

10:43.076 --> 10:44.712
your wife when she
visits her sister.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.981
Oh, it's going to be
like that, huh?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.119
Take your time.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.553
Enjoy our cable

10:53.620 --> 10:55.355
(chuckles)

10:57.991 --> 10:59.893
The Chance family

10:59.960 --> 11:01.795
had captured more
than a murderer.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.297
They captured
the town's attention.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.166
I became a-a bit
of a local celebrity.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.735
Uh, the sandwich shop
changed the name

11:07.801 --> 11:09.803
of the hero sandwich
to the Jimmy.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.971
People started stopping me
on the street

11:11.038 --> 11:12.372
to ask for my autograph.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.542
Then, a real movie company
asked me to be in a movie.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.945
All the real stars had done
movies for this company:

11:18.011 --> 11:19.713
Tanya Harding, John Wayne
Bobbitt,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.148
Joey Buttafuoco, Screech.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.062
If there's
going to be

11:35.128 --> 11:38.631
any stabbing,
it will be done by me!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.000
With my body parts!

11:40.067 --> 11:44.204
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

11:46.006 --> 11:48.408
That's all you get, perverts.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.979
Jimmy Chance was
enjoying his fame,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.647
but eventually
he became old news

11:54.714 --> 11:58.886
and his high from being
a celebrity came crashing down

11:58.952 --> 12:02.489
harder than a contestant
on Dancing with the Stars

12:02.555 --> 12:05.625
who was voted off way too early.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.127
We hadn't seen him
spend this much time

12:07.194 --> 12:08.628
locked in his room
since he was 13.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.198
At least back then, he came
out with a smile on his face.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.332
(both laugh)

12:13.566 --> 12:15.702
But, yeah, but this time,

12:15.769 --> 12:16.870
he came out all depressed,

12:16.937 --> 12:19.739
with those weird drawings.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.876
VIRGINIA:
I was at my wit's end
and was this close

12:22.943 --> 12:24.377
to buying a self-help book.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.714
But then I realized, hey,
we live next door to a shrink.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.482
I'm not a shrink.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.053
I got a psychology magazine
in the mail once by mistake.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.122
Burt saw it
and started calling me Doc.

12:35.188 --> 12:39.860
He said he would mow my lawn
for free if I evaluated his son.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.528
So I went with it.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.395
(barks)

12:42.462 --> 12:43.430
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.932
Jasper, it's okay.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.801
It's just the mailman.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.238
So, anyway,
according to the Internet,

12:51.304 --> 12:54.274
the kid suffered from
"hero depression."

12:54.341 --> 12:55.308
(Burt barking)

12:55.375 --> 12:58.178
When average people,
or in Jimmy's case,

12:58.245 --> 13:00.914
below average,
get thrust into the spotlight,

13:00.981 --> 13:03.016
they suddenly feel euphoric.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.952
And then when
the spotlight goes away,

13:05.018 --> 13:06.854
so does their sense of
self-worth.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.988
Bark! Bark!
Bark! Bark!

13:08.055 --> 13:11.691
Bark! Bark! Bark!
Bark! Bark! Bark...

13:11.758 --> 13:13.927
He's a dog, Burt!

13:13.994 --> 13:15.228
You're a human!

13:15.295 --> 13:17.030
I take some
of the blame.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.499
As a child, I put a
lot of pressure on him

13:19.566 --> 13:20.733
to become famous.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.504
When Jimmy Chance was 13,
the Chance family decided

13:24.571 --> 13:29.642
to send in an audition tape
for the TV show Star Search.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.912
Hello, Mr. McMahon.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.981
I'm James Bon Jovi Chance.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.515
I'm about to sing
so beautifully,

13:35.582 --> 13:38.919
I'll make you forget all about
your drinking problem.

13:40.653 --> 13:46.226
* With a guy like me,
with a girl like you *

13:46.293 --> 13:49.662
* Oh, could you ever see *

13:49.729 --> 13:53.934
As amazing as Jimmy Chance was,
it was all for naught,

13:54.001 --> 13:58.705
because Star Search had been
off the air for ten years

13:58.771 --> 14:02.842
and the Chance family
was only watching reruns.

14:02.910 --> 14:06.046
* Cheyenne... *

14:06.113 --> 14:08.515
Ed, this kid is the star.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.951
So, disregard all those
earlier tapes I sent

14:11.018 --> 14:14.321
of me break-dancing
pregnant, okay?

14:18.391 --> 14:23.130
So, primed to be a star and
finding he no longer was one,

14:23.196 --> 14:26.499
Jimmy Chance wallowed
in self-pity.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.003
Until he got some news
from prison

14:30.070 --> 14:32.605
that would change
his life forever.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.740
You're pregnant?

14:33.806 --> 14:35.875
Say something to your baby.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.744
Hey, baby.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.246
Uh, uh...

14:39.312 --> 14:41.814
(stuttering)

14:41.881 --> 14:45.185
(stuttering echoes)

14:45.252 --> 14:47.487
At first, Jimmy didn't
handle the news

14:47.554 --> 14:49.522
of getting a serial killer
pregnant very well.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.424
Especially since he thought
the baby was gonna

14:51.491 --> 14:53.326
have to spend her life
in prison, too.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.995
You're the one
who told him that.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.529
I did.
I did tell him that!

14:56.596 --> 14:57.597
(laughs)

14:58.631 --> 15:02.002
Tell them about the letter.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.670
NANCY:
learned to ignore

15:03.736 --> 15:06.506
most of what the old lady
had to say,

15:06.573 --> 15:11.244
turns out, there was a letter
written from Lucy to Jimmy

15:11.311 --> 15:14.681
shortly after he found out
she was pregnant.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.485
LUCY:
"Jimmy, ever since
you came to see me,

15:18.551 --> 15:20.520
"I can't stop
thinking about you

15:20.587 --> 15:23.723
"and this life we created
growing inside me.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.692
"Even though there are
many female prisoners

15:25.758 --> 15:29.162
"with your hairstyle, there's
no one here quite like you.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.698
"It would mean the world to me
to know our baby

15:31.764 --> 15:34.934
"will someday know it was born
to married parents.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.737
"I know I'm not long for this
world, but I'd like to spend

15:37.804 --> 15:40.340
"the rest of my life,
which is six more months,

15:40.407 --> 15:42.742
as Mrs. Jimmy
whatever your last name is."

15:42.809 --> 15:46.313
Anyone in their right mind would
have run away from a proposal

15:46.379 --> 15:48.781
from a convicted serial killer.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.851
But then, Inside Probe
wouldn't have covered that.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.954
Yes. Yes!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.957
(moans)

15:58.025 --> 16:00.227
(phone ringing)

16:02.996 --> 16:04.464
Hello.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.899
You said yes?!
You said yes?!

16:06.966 --> 16:07.934
I was flattered!

16:08.001 --> 16:09.436
I told you not to watch this!

16:09.502 --> 16:11.204
(grunts)

16:15.175 --> 16:17.310
Anybody want some chamomile?

16:26.753 --> 16:27.620
Hey.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.956
I cannot believe
you agreed to marry her.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.058
Shh!

16:31.124 --> 16:34.894
A killer terrorizes a city,

16:34.961 --> 16:37.764
a simple young man
impregnates her,

16:37.830 --> 16:38.998
captures her.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.768
The young couple falls in love.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.303
A wedding is planned.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.605
Things were getting spicy.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.043
Not a fan.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.644
I was against it at first.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.414
But then I told her,
"Look, Jimmy's our son.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.217
"Whoever he loves, we have
to honor and respect that.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.052
"And besides, she'll be dead
in six months,

16:59.119 --> 17:00.120
and he'll be single again."

17:00.187 --> 17:01.554
Believe it or not,

17:01.621 --> 17:04.424
we get a lot of wedding requests
at the prison.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.594
Mostly it's gal-on-gal,
but every once in a while,

17:07.660 --> 17:10.697
a fella comes in and wants
to marry one of our guests.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.065
We try to accommodate.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.068
Howdy's Catering puts in bids
for all the prison weddings.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.903
We also do last meals, too.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.239
Lot of leftovers for those.

17:19.306 --> 17:22.209
Sad throwing away
all those shrimp.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.344
Anyway, in keeping with
the prison theme,

17:24.411 --> 17:25.778
among the items we served

17:25.845 --> 17:29.882
were chocolate bars and a Jewish
smoked salmon called lox.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.718
Bars, lox-- get it?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.053
(chuckles)

17:34.121 --> 17:35.155
They didn't, either.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.090
NANCY:
Jimmy even got his mom

17:37.157 --> 17:39.859
to help with the bride's dress.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.228
The wedding was on.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.763
A desperate groom looking for
meaning in his life,

17:43.830 --> 17:47.100
his family who was trying
to make the best of the day,

17:47.167 --> 17:50.303
and a wedding procession
not to be believed.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.614
Oh, remember Teresa
with the mask?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.950
Yeah, Burt, you tend
not to forget the person

18:04.016 --> 18:05.252
who tries to bite
your ear off.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.254
You just had to
see her face.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.193
This is crazy.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.729
Hey, we're here to work,
not to be looky-loos.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.531
I do.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.168
And do you, Jimmy,
take this woman Lucy

18:21.234 --> 18:24.204
to be your lawfully wedded wife
until death--

18:24.271 --> 18:27.740
until Tuesday, September 21,
at midnight?

18:27.807 --> 18:28.908
I do.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.177
The couple wed.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.312
They danced the night away.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.614
* Your best friend Harry
has a brother Larry *

18:34.681 --> 18:36.649
* In five days from now,
he's gonna marry *

18:36.716 --> 18:38.618
* He's hoping you can
make it there if you can *

18:38.685 --> 18:40.887
* 'Cause in the ceremony,
you'll be the best man *

18:40.953 --> 18:42.722
* You say "neat-o,"
check your libido *

18:42.789 --> 18:44.724
* And roll to the church
in your new tuxedo *

18:44.791 --> 18:46.759
* The bride walks down
just to start the wedding *

18:46.826 --> 18:48.761
* And there's one more girl
you won't be getting *

18:48.828 --> 18:50.663
* So you start thinking,
then you start blinking *

18:50.730 --> 18:52.499
* A bridesmaid looks
and thinks that you're winking *

18:52.565 --> 18:54.501
* She thinks you're kind of cute
so she winks back *

18:54.567 --> 18:55.968
* And now you're feeling
really firm *

18:56.035 --> 18:57.170
* 'Cause the girl is stacked *

18:57.237 --> 18:59.539
The two young lovers
cut the cake.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.942
Everything seemed
just fine and dandy.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.311
Until this.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.279
Freeze! Everybody freeze!

19:06.346 --> 19:08.181
Or I'll cut
this fool's head off!

19:08.248 --> 19:10.183
In hindsight, we realized that

19:10.250 --> 19:12.118
giving a serial
stabber-of-male-companions

19:12.185 --> 19:13.686
access to a knife
while she stood

19:13.753 --> 19:15.855
next to her new male companion
was probably

19:15.922 --> 19:17.624
an avoidable mistake.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.658
(chuckles)

19:18.725 --> 19:20.293
Live and learn.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.828
(screams)

19:21.894 --> 19:23.996
I need a helicopter
out of here in an hour,

19:24.063 --> 19:26.366
$600 and two tickets
to Mamma Mia,

19:26.433 --> 19:28.235
or my husband's head
leaves here in a bag!

19:28.301 --> 19:29.969
Do you want to see
Mamma Mia?

19:30.036 --> 19:30.970
No.

19:31.037 --> 19:31.971
One ticket!

19:32.038 --> 19:34.073
Freeze!

19:34.140 --> 19:36.976
(Tasers crackling)

19:37.043 --> 19:39.279
(shuddering):
Thank you.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.582
What happens next?

19:42.649 --> 19:45.084
You'll find out
after the commercial,

19:45.151 --> 19:48.421
when we reveal
a bombshell so huge

19:48.488 --> 19:51.724
it will absolutely
blow your minds.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.025
Oh, please.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.161
They always say that at the end
to get you to watch

19:55.228 --> 19:56.496
the last two minutes
of the show.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.198
I know I always say this,
but seriously,

19:59.266 --> 20:03.536
this bombshell coming up,
it's going to blow your mind.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.004
Nah.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.373
I already know what happens.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.842
Lucy has the baby,
she gets fried, and we get Hope.

20:09.909 --> 20:10.943
I'm going to bed.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.279
You sure about that?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.415
Damn it, they're good.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.855
ANNOUNCER:
Can't get enough
My Name is Earl?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.457
My Name is Earl
five days a week.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.692
You married a woman
who was executed

20:25.758 --> 20:27.760
and you never thought that was
worth sharing with me?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.363
I had to look at your blog
to find out that you love

20:30.430 --> 20:32.064
Arcade Fire and hate
people who snoop around.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.032
We all have secrets.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.267
Shh!
(groans)

20:34.334 --> 20:35.735
Welcome back.

20:35.802 --> 20:39.372
Tonight, we showed you the story
of the Chance family,

20:39.439 --> 20:42.041
the serial killer
who changed their lives,

20:42.108 --> 20:44.311
and the jailhouse wedding
that ended

20:44.377 --> 20:46.713
in a brief hostage situation.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.415
But what we haven't shown you

20:48.481 --> 20:52.719
is that Lucy Carlyle
gave birth to her child.

20:52.785 --> 20:56.723
A lovely little girl
named Princess Beyoncé,

20:56.789 --> 20:58.725
whose name was later changed.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.792
To Hope.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.660
Blah, blah, blah.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.095
We know all this already, Nancy.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.164
I knew I should've
gone to bed.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.300
...Carlyle was executed.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.936
This crazy story
was finally over.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.538
BURT:
You were right,
Virginia.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.039
They keep you sticking around
for the last segment,

21:13.105 --> 21:14.040
then they got nothing!

21:14.106 --> 21:15.408
I'm just glad it's over.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.444
Or was it over?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.680
There was one more

21:20.747 --> 21:22.114
bombshell left.

21:22.181 --> 21:25.151
A bombshell named Lucy Carlyle.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.986
I'm alive!

21:27.053 --> 21:28.688
(Jimmy gasps, Burt groans)

21:28.755 --> 21:30.723
You thought I was dead,
but I'm not.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.424
Bam!

21:31.491 --> 21:32.992
How you like them apples?

21:37.864 --> 21:40.633
That was worth
sticking around for.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.375
Nancy Grace
is a babe.
