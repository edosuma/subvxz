WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:06.474
* Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da-da *

00:06.540 --> 00:08.542
Bah!

00:09.610 --> 00:11.645
Aha!

00:14.648 --> 00:16.217
Gotcha!
(chuckles)

00:16.284 --> 00:18.652
As soon as I find
your dad, you're it.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.987
Burt, I need a hint.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.089
Can I get a boo-ya?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.523
BURT:
Boo-ya.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.131
Oh, crap-o!
What is it?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.599
Your Uncle Bruce
just pulled up.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.201
JIMMY:
So?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.802
VIRGINIA:
He already thinks
we're big enough idiots.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.738
Now here we are in our pj's
playing hide-and-go-seek

00:37.805 --> 00:39.273
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.210
Burt, your brother Bruce
is here. Come out.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.245
(quietly):
Yeah, right.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.513
(knocking on door)

00:46.847 --> 00:49.150
Bruce. How are you?

00:49.217 --> 00:51.919
Sweaty. You might want
to police your yard debris.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.053
Will do.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.822
Hey, what happened to your ear?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.291
I was testing the batteries
on a fire alarm, and...

00:57.358 --> 00:58.892
You know what, I'm not here
for chitty-chat, Virginia.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.828
Where's Burt?
Burt?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.029
Um...

01:02.096 --> 01:03.497
He's working.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.199
He's working hard
on the business,

01:05.266 --> 01:06.734
which is going
really well right now.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.070
We were all working hard, too,
last night,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.740
which is why we're in
our pj's.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.741
Hi, Uncle Bruce.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.909
You're holding a baby.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.678
Yeah. See, what happened was...

01:17.745 --> 01:20.148
I don't need to know.
Really, do I?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.183
When Burt gets back
from work would you tell him...

01:22.250 --> 01:23.184
BURT:
Cramp!

01:23.251 --> 01:24.585
I'm getting
a cramp!

01:26.854 --> 01:28.189
Cramp!

01:28.256 --> 01:30.824
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.194
Whoo.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.764
We were playing
hide-and-go-seek.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.167
Of course you were.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.836
Can I fix you something to eat?

01:42.903 --> 01:45.339
No, no, no need to spray cheese
on anything.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.607
I just wanted
to drop off

01:46.674 --> 01:48.542
this box of crap
for my deadbeat son.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.411
For your information, Mike
went on a spiritual quest

01:50.478 --> 01:51.812
about six months ago.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.881
Moved in with a large group
of like-minded people,

01:53.947 --> 01:56.650
and as there have been
no reports on the news
of any mass suicides,

01:56.717 --> 01:57.618
we assume he's
doing very well.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.019
Yeah, I know
he's not here.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.188
He's coming on Saturday.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.555
You didn't get a letter?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.424
Oh, yeah,
I'm sure we got it.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.359
We've just been busy.
With work.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.860
It's probably in here somewhere.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.464
We're not crazy or anything.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.866
Just been a bit hectic with,
you know, the business

02:12.933 --> 02:14.268
and the baby

02:14.335 --> 02:16.704
and being caretakers
to Virginia's grandma.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.006
JIMMY:
If Mike's coming, don't you
want to be here to see him?

02:19.072 --> 02:20.441
I bet he misses you.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.542
He wrote you a letter, right?

02:21.609 --> 02:22.976
He just wants his hamster back.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.912
Oh, that reminds me.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.118
You might want to stick some
lettuce or something in there.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.687
You know, Mike's a good kid.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.822
He might not be

02:34.888 --> 02:36.490
all wealthy
and prosperous,

02:36.557 --> 02:38.158
but that's just your definition
of success.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.994
It's the dictionary's
definition.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.630
Your dictionary, man.

02:42.696 --> 02:48.636
Jimmy, this is your report card
from junior year of high school.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.804
Am I going to be happy
when I open this?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.275
* Whoo! *

02:54.342 --> 02:58.612
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. *

02:59.580 --> 03:00.681
MAW MAW:
Boo-ya!

03:00.748 --> 03:02.916
Is Maw Maw still
playing hide-and-go-seek?

03:02.983 --> 03:05.185
Yeah, she's been
boo-ya-ing all morning.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.655
I don't know where she is,
but it's keeping her busy.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.592
Boo-ya!

03:11.659 --> 03:14.795
Well, she'll come out
when she's hungry.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.530
You're going to love
my cousin Mike.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
He's been involved in
a lot of different groups.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.601
Some are cults,
some are religions.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.336
One time he just lived
with the animals.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.637
My craziest
cousin is Tim.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.872
He's an ultra gay
conservative.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.441
He's a member of
the Herbal Tea Party.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.343
Claims there's
eight members.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.512
Oh, he's not here yet?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.847
Wh-why are we trying
to make him feel so welcome?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.850
Last time I offered
him a cold drink, he
stayed for six years.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.988
Boo-ya!

03:55.436 --> 03:56.770
Tanya, this is
my Aunt Virginia,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.205
Cousin Jimmy,

03:58.272 --> 03:59.307
some girl,

03:59.373 --> 04:01.174
and the greatest uncle
of all time.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.376
I don't know about that.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.877
That Uncle Cracker's
pretty cool.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.980
Guys, this is Tanya.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.248
My wife!

04:08.316 --> 04:09.450
You got married?

04:09.517 --> 04:10.918
That's awesome!

04:10.984 --> 04:12.920
I wish your dad
was here for this.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.222
But he's busy
being a big throbbing tool.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.090
Hmm.
Let's call him up,

04:17.157 --> 04:18.426
and rub the happy news
in his face.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.028
Who are those guys?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.863
Those are my brother-husbands.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.466
Your brother what?

04:25.533 --> 04:28.336
We're reverse gender
polygamists.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.037
We are all married--

04:30.103 --> 04:31.439
but not in a gay way.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.140
Just four dudes
and one wife.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.375
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.677
(high-pitched voice):
Sorry, wrong number.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.012
Thank you so much
for letting me come over.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.424
Well, all right.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.493
Five people married
to each other.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.194
That is neat.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.963
Neat,

04:56.029 --> 04:57.631
neat stuff.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.667
Oh, I wrote down
a few questions,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.902
if you guys don't mind.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.936
No problem.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.638
We understand people
are curious.

05:04.705 --> 05:05.973
The only thing
we don't discuss

05:06.039 --> 05:06.907
is our sex life.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.378
Of course.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.488
(clearing throat)

05:20.554 --> 05:25.158
Man, that is neat, neat stuff.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.227
Do you think
they brainwashed him?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.662
Probably.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.564
I'm just glad they
washed him at all.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.165
And make sure you
keep your distance,

05:32.232 --> 05:34.502
so you don't let them
lure you in like you did

05:34.568 --> 05:35.836
with that cult that
worships Josh Groban.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.939
I wasn't that caught up in that,
I swear to Josh.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.109
I mean God.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.244
Here's some refreshments.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.480
Made some deviled eggs.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.348
Which is not an indicament

05:48.416 --> 05:50.418
of how I feel about your...
lifestyle.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.885
We just happen to really love

05:51.952 --> 05:53.286
mayonnaise, mustard and eggs
around here.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.255
Thank you so much.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.558
Listen, you all
seem like great people

05:57.625 --> 05:59.760
with a lot of love in your heart
for Mike.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.829
Which is a blessing
because

06:01.895 --> 06:04.264
there's another reason why we
wanted to come here today.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.933
Mike,

06:05.999 --> 06:08.836
we wanted you to be
around your family today,

06:08.902 --> 06:09.737
because today

06:09.803 --> 06:12.005
we're leaving you.
What?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.140
Not neat, man.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.677
When we leave here today,
it will be without you.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.979
But you've got your
family to lean on.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.414
Uh...

06:20.481 --> 06:22.583
Tanya, you and I
are so good together.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.218
Yeah, you're like
a match made in Heaven.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.320
Not my Heaven, but...

06:27.387 --> 06:28.422
TANYA:
It's not me.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.523
It's their call.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.858
My brother-husbands?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.594
Brother-husbands...

06:33.661 --> 06:35.763
Mike, it's obvious.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.765
You're just not
that into us.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.868
You only pay attention
to Tanya.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.403
Um, yeah, she's the chick.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.372
That's...

06:45.439 --> 06:46.940
What are you...? Tanya?

06:47.007 --> 06:50.878
You're married to Jeff,
Chester and Rodney, too.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.980
You know what
the sacred pamphlet says.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.583
You must be your brother's,
brother's, brother's keeper.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.557
Tanya, give me
one more chance.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.993
I mean, who's going to
keep you warm at night

07:06.059 --> 07:07.327
on Tuesdays
and alternating Saturdays?

07:07.394 --> 07:09.963
A relationship isn't
a two-way street, Mike.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.765
It's a five-way intersection.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.634
I bet you don't even know
which one of our secret dreams

07:13.701 --> 07:15.235
is to sing opera.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.004
Uh...

07:17.070 --> 07:19.072
* Mi-mi-mi-mi,
mi-mi-mi-mi-mi. *

07:19.139 --> 07:21.408
Which one of us has the
sarcastic sense of humor?

07:21.475 --> 07:22.910
Jeff.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.178
Oh, sure, Jeff.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.781
And I guess pigs are flying
now, aren't they?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.683
I bet you don't even know
which one of us

07:29.750 --> 07:31.318
can't say the word "psghetti."

07:31.384 --> 07:32.686
Screw these guys, Mike.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.387
There's way better
cults out there

07:34.454 --> 07:35.856
who'd be lucky to have you.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.259
Oh, come on, you
got to keep Mike.
Mike is great.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.895
Do you know he
can, um, whistle?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.931
Show her how
you whistle, Mike.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.633
I can't.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.800
Oh, you moron.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.902
I'm sorry, Mike. It's over.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.171
You know the divorce ritual.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.446
(groans)

07:59.513 --> 08:01.615
(coughs)

08:01.682 --> 08:05.285
And now the healing process
can begin.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.688
(starter motor grinding)

08:10.824 --> 08:14.928
We might need
to stay the night.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.668
(Mike sobbing)

08:23.336 --> 08:24.938
Poor little guy.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.474
I haven't seen him this upset
since the end of Armageddon

08:27.541 --> 08:29.276
when the fat guy from
Herman's Head died.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.012
Hello, monogamists?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.981
Hey, is there
any chance

08:34.047 --> 08:36.049
that we could get Mike's
shirt and khakis back?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.118
We kind of like
to keep them in the family.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.855
Here! I don't need your
stupid clothes anyway!

08:41.922 --> 08:43.691
I can do just
fine without you!

08:43.757 --> 08:45.626
Uncle Burt, can I borrow
some clothes later?

08:45.693 --> 08:47.227
Sure thing, Mike.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.829
Better clothes, too.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.363
Stuff with words on it.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.865
(sobbing)

08:54.602 --> 08:58.005
* *

09:00.107 --> 09:00.874
Okay.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.610
I can't take this.

09:02.676 --> 09:06.213
You got to call your
brother and tell him
to get him out of here.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.314
It's his kid.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.583
Yeah, his kid that he threw out
with nowhere to go.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.785
He looks up to me.
I'm like his hero.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.054
Besides, I don't even think
Bruce would take him back.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.323
Burt, that laundry room
is my chick cave, okay?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.490
That's where I go

09:17.557 --> 09:19.292
to chew my nicotine gum

09:19.359 --> 09:21.428
and scheme about ways
I'm going to get on Oprah.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.396
And if Mike's in there,
my dreams are shot.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.165
And I don't think
I'll get on Oprah.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.667
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

09:26.734 --> 09:29.102
You'll never meet Oprah.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.104
I'm gonna go talk
to my brother.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.342
Boo-ya!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.277
It's like my six dads
always used to say.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.280
Having brother-husbands is like
having really cool roommates.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.717
I guess it would be
nice to always have
a buddy to hang out with.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.052
Oh, yeah. We help
each other out.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.119
We laugh.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.288
Last night we were up
till 3:00 in the morning

09:48.355 --> 09:51.358
eating pumpkin cheesecake
and watching Lord of the Rings.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.993
I love Lord of the Rings.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.095
(imitating Gollum):
My precious.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.031
Gollum would never
lie to master.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.401
That is fantastic!
Guys, did you hear this?

10:01.468 --> 10:03.503
Yeah. That was awesome!

10:03.570 --> 10:06.974
(as Gollum):
Really? My family
finds it super annoying.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.575
We would never
find that annoying.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.410
You know, you should come in.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.646
We're getting ready to watch
Return of the King on Blu-ray

10:12.713 --> 10:13.747
and eat some s'mores.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.716
Ooh. Ooh, I don't know.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.484
She really loves wagon time.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.518
Oh, I'll pull her around.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.453
Really?
Yeah.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.554
Helping hands, man.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.555
That's how we roll.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.324
Literally.
Okay.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.260
(as Gollum):
Take care of my precious.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.996
Gollum thank you.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.530
Gollum...

10:30.597 --> 10:31.699
Can you say da-das?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.400
Say da-das.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.102
Oh.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.741
You guys are right.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.743
These shirts
are super comfortable.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.378
You've got to be kidding me.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.484
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

10:51.551 --> 10:53.253
You bros are awesome!

10:53.320 --> 10:55.055
There we go. (gasps)

10:55.122 --> 10:58.826
I leave you alone for 20
minutes, and you get sucked in.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.027
I didn't get
sucked in.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.294
I was just watching a movie,

11:01.361 --> 11:03.230
and I got some melted
marshmallow on my pants,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.098
which they were nice enough
to wash off for me.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.967
Plus, they were teaching Hope
a church song called

11:07.034 --> 11:08.736
"Old Religions Are Dusty" and...

11:08.802 --> 11:10.804
Oh, my God, I got sucked in.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.339
How could you?!

11:12.405 --> 11:14.507
Oh, I don't know!
They were cool!

11:14.574 --> 11:16.509
All right? They laughed at my
Gollum and my Yoda.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.846
Plus, they are interesting
guys.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.481
Jeff does card tricks,
Chester can rap in Filipino.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.383
Rodney has ten toes.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.386
Six are on one foot,
and four are on the other.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.288
I mean, how cool is that?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.424
What?! You spent
an hour with those guys,
and you already know

11:31.491 --> 11:32.325
all that stuff?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.994
I was married to them
for six months.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.163
The only thing I know about them
is that they all hate me.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.431
I guess I really was
a lousy brother-husband.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.834
What else do you know
about these people?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.435
Lots of stuff.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.404
I have an idea.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.140
Take off your pants.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.543
I don't want to
hear any more

11:50.610 --> 11:52.479
about cult stuff
or pup tents!

11:52.545 --> 11:55.215
I've heard enough about that
flake. Ah! Jiminy Christmas!

11:55.282 --> 11:57.184
Caught a staple.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.652
Hello, tetanus shot,
good-bye $20 co-pay.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.720
Nicely done.

12:00.788 --> 12:01.922
Look, Virginia won't keep him.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.290
And he's hurting right now.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.125
He just gotten broken up with
by four people at once.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.094
Perfect. My kid is
the only person in history

12:07.160 --> 12:08.595
to get rejected by a cult.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.197
Aw, cut the kid some slack.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.364
Oh, sure,
you defend him.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.133
Losers stick together.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.367
We're both business owners.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.769
Why are you always calling me
a loser?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.570
I was voted
"Mattress Man of the Year"

12:17.637 --> 12:19.239
three times running, okay?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.641
I have priority check-in
at several commuter airlines.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.843
I drive a
late-model crossover.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.278
You and I are not even
in the same league.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.452
That is not cool.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.755
No, no, no!

12:35.823 --> 12:37.657
Those are not
to be removed,

12:37.724 --> 12:39.026
under penalty of law!

12:40.627 --> 12:42.495
(grunting)

12:42.562 --> 12:43.730
Hey!

12:43.797 --> 12:45.265
Put the Ovechkin down!

12:45.332 --> 12:47.067
How dare you come in here
and mess up my store

12:47.134 --> 12:48.869
the way you ruined my life!

12:48.936 --> 12:50.603
How did I ruin your life?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.539
You turned my son against me!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.274
You never even liked
the kid!

12:54.341 --> 12:56.343
I adored him!

12:56.409 --> 12:59.179
I wanted him to work with me
and not you!

12:59.246 --> 13:00.848
Why'd you throw him out?!

13:00.914 --> 13:02.415
'Cause nothing else helped him!

13:02.482 --> 13:05.886
I spent my life guiding people
to softness or firmness.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.455
That kid needed firmness!
(grunts)

13:08.521 --> 13:10.723
Oh, gosh! Oh, golly!

13:10.790 --> 13:13.193
I think Ovechkin knocked out
a crown.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.495
I haven't even reached

13:15.562 --> 13:16.930
the deductible on my dental
yet this year.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.498
That's 300 bucks right off
the top.

13:18.565 --> 13:22.002
So you threw Mike out
to try and help him?

13:22.069 --> 13:25.072
Uh-huh. I thought he'd see
how hard the world is,

13:25.138 --> 13:27.240
get his life together
and come back to me.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.343
But then you gave him
a soft spot to land.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.580
And Mike never learned
how take care of himself.
Uh-huh.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.349
All he learned from you is that
his old man is a giant tool.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.784
(entry bell jingles)

13:37.851 --> 13:39.419
Welcome to Chance Upon
a Mattress!

13:39.486 --> 13:40.687
I'll be right with you.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.089
Just finishing up over here.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.158
Bruce, I'm sorry.
I really screwed up.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.260
But I'm gonna make things right
between you and your boy.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.128
Burt...

13:48.195 --> 13:49.963
No, I am.
I promise.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.731
I'm gonna get you your son back.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.534
Okay.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.338
Ma'am, if you'll direct
your attention

13:58.405 --> 14:01.574
to that wall over there,
you'll see our weekly specials.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.113
That's for ripping my tags.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.820
Tanya, brother husbands,
um, you know

14:13.887 --> 14:16.990
I'm not much of a singer
any more than I am a listener,

14:17.057 --> 14:18.992
but I did hear
what you said before.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.793
And I wrote you all a song.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.331
(upbeat tune playing)

14:28.001 --> 14:30.971
* I used to think
love was for two *

14:31.038 --> 14:33.673
Just for two.
* That was before I met you *

14:33.740 --> 14:35.675
And you and you and you.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.211
* Your arms were open, but mine
was not, you gave me love *

14:38.278 --> 14:39.746
* But I gave you squat *

14:39.812 --> 14:42.549
* Now I'm alone,
but I have grown *

14:42.615 --> 14:46.053
I really have!
* I don't just want
to share a lover *

14:46.119 --> 14:50.323
* I want to share my life
with my brothers *

14:50.390 --> 14:54.561
* Jeff, Rodney, Chester,
what do you say? *

14:54.627 --> 14:58.531
* Let's not just share a lover,
let's share love *

14:58.598 --> 15:00.467
* Chester wasn't fit
to wear these chinos *

15:00.533 --> 15:02.135
I'm such a fool.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.304
* Ignoring your skills
at rapping in Filipino *

15:04.371 --> 15:05.939
Hey, that sounds
really cool.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.540
* Rodney, my chakra's
feeling fine *

15:07.607 --> 15:10.743
* But I should've
let you align *
* My chi *

15:10.810 --> 15:13.080
* I'm so sorry *

15:13.146 --> 15:15.315
* Jeff, I'd love to see
some sleight of hand *

15:15.382 --> 15:16.649
You make my sadness disappear!

15:16.716 --> 15:19.052
* But I'd really like to be
your brother-husband *

15:19.119 --> 15:20.920
I'm down on my knees here!

15:20.988 --> 15:23.957
* You guys love some parts of me
that are now so clearly empty *

15:24.024 --> 15:29.796
* These holes where I used
to see my brothers in polygamy *

15:29.862 --> 15:31.198
Mm-hmm.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.335
* Yeah, I just don't want
to share a lover *

15:35.402 --> 15:39.272
* I want to share my life
with my brothers *

15:39.339 --> 15:43.676
* Jeff, Rodney, Chester,
what do you say? *

15:43.743 --> 15:47.180
* Let's not just share a lover,
let's share love *

15:47.247 --> 15:52.952
* I used to think love
was for two... *

15:53.020 --> 15:59.059
* That's before I met you
and you and you... *

15:59.126 --> 16:02.295
(playing flourish)

16:12.005 --> 16:13.073
What are you guys doing?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
Where's Mike?

16:14.841 --> 16:15.942
Oh, living the dream.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.644
No plans, no phones,

16:17.710 --> 16:20.413
just four awesome dudes,
an RV and a wife.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.614
How could you let him leave?!

16:21.681 --> 16:23.783
Relax, Burt, he said
he'd be back

16:23.850 --> 16:24.751
every fifth Thanksgiving.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.419
No! I promised!

16:26.486 --> 16:28.421
I gotta think.
Think, think, think, think!

16:28.488 --> 16:31.224
Aw, crap! Now all I can think
is the word "think"!

16:34.061 --> 16:35.628
(grunting)

16:37.297 --> 16:39.166
(hushed): I'd like to report
a missing person.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.768
My nephew took off with some
people in an RV.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.470
No, not against his will,

16:43.536 --> 16:46.806
but he's... he's 25,
he's got blonde hair...

16:46.873 --> 16:49.776
What do you mean you're not
gonna go after him?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.912
Well, how young would he have to
be for you to do something?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.114
Okay, thank you.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.985
(high-pitched voice):
Yes, my one-year-old
granddaughter's

16:59.052 --> 17:02.489
been kidnapped by a cult!

17:02.555 --> 17:03.623
Thank you.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.797
Hide the baby! Hide the baby!
Wha... Why?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.765
I told the police
the cult kidnapped Hope.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.402
You lied to the police?
Are you crazy?
No, no, relax.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.604
I have a plan.
When they find the RV,

17:17.670 --> 17:19.439
I'll just tell 'em Hope was
hiding in

17:19.506 --> 17:21.641
the attic the whole time.
Just like the balloon guy

17:21.708 --> 17:23.443
we saw interviewed by that
dude... What's his name?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.178
You know, the only
guy I'd be into

17:25.245 --> 17:27.080
if I was gay, but I'm not?
Matt Lauer.

17:27.147 --> 17:30.417
You made Hope an accomplice.
She can't go back to jail, Dad.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.319
I had to.
I cost my brother a son.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.620
I pulled them apart.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.123
How would you feel if someone
took Jimmy from us?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.458
For how long?

17:38.525 --> 17:41.294
I just want to answer
accurately.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.829
Hide the baby! Hide the baby.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.599
Act sad.
(moans)

17:48.335 --> 17:52.071
Please find our angel.

17:52.139 --> 17:55.842
Breaking news: police are
issuing a AMBER Alert for an RV

17:55.908 --> 17:57.277
after a man, seen here,

17:57.344 --> 17:59.546
and his accomplices
kidnapped this child.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.282
The man has been identified
as Mike Chance.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.117
The little girl was last seen
taking a nap

18:04.184 --> 18:06.586
at home with her father and
grandparents. Authorities...

18:06.653 --> 18:10.089
Son of a biscuit, Mike!
What is wrong with you?!

18:10.157 --> 18:11.291
You say the baby is how old?

18:11.358 --> 18:13.260
She's around one.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.363
And um, what's going on
over here?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.331
Oh, that's
my grandmother.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.301
You know old people,
always cold.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.902
What'd he do this time?

18:22.969 --> 18:24.271
Who's this guy?

18:24.337 --> 18:25.705
It's my brother.
His son's in the RV.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.440
Please, I'm begging you,
when you catch him,

18:27.507 --> 18:29.041
beat him black and blue.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.577
I'd love to,
but with the Internet

18:30.643 --> 18:31.944
and phone cameras,
the fun's over.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.180
Don't listen to him.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.347
He's distraught.
I'll take him in

18:34.414 --> 18:35.482
the back,
settle him down.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.949
Come on.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.086
MAW MAW (echoing):
Boo-ya!

18:40.153 --> 18:42.555
I always knew that kid
was a disaster!

18:42.622 --> 18:44.957
He better not let anything
happen to that baby!

18:45.024 --> 18:46.959
(hushed):
Don't worry. Baby's fine.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.295
Hey, Uncle Bruce.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.398
What the heck is this, some kind
of Japanese game show?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.233
I really wanted to make things
right between you and Mike,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.434
but when I got home,
he was gone.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.703
Burt, this is insane!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.805
Don't worry. When the cops
find the RV,

18:58.871 --> 19:00.640
I'll just tell 'em it was
all a mistake.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.475
Hope was hiding in the attic
the whole time,

19:02.542 --> 19:03.676
just like that balloon boy guy.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.977
Yeah, Burt,
that guy went to jail!

19:05.044 --> 19:06.078
Really?
Yeah!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.247
What'd he do wrong?

19:07.314 --> 19:08.815
Like, everything
you already did.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.983
(panicked grunting)

19:11.050 --> 19:13.152
You guys better get out here.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.789
Sorry.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.895
(hushed): Dang it, Burt!

19:22.962 --> 19:24.897
They're gonna shoot my kid.
You gotta tell 'em what you did.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.369
Um, I think I hear something.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.138
Did anyone else hear that?

19:32.205 --> 19:35.041
It sounds like a baby

19:35.107 --> 19:38.245
accidentally lost
in the bathroom.

19:43.550 --> 19:47.153
So, what was believed to be
a kidnapping turned out to be

19:47.220 --> 19:48.888
a hoax perpetrated
by this man,

19:48.955 --> 19:53.059
local business owner and
Internet sensation Burt Chance.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.028
The drivers of the RV;
an Osmond family cover band,

19:56.095 --> 19:57.330
were released.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.233
Chance was sentenced
to 30 days in jail.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.535
Is it the light?

20:02.602 --> 20:03.836
No.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.937
Is it the bunk bed?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.005
No.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.073
Is it the floor?

20:07.139 --> 20:08.107
Yes.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.810
Okay, my turn.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.745
Got it? Go.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.846
Is it the light?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.014
Yes.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.283
Chance, today's
the day.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.750
Let's go.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.456
(laughs)

20:30.363 --> 20:31.631
You're gonna shave, right?

20:31.698 --> 20:34.901
Yeah. Might take a couple
pictures of myself in

20:34.967 --> 20:37.404
a flannel shirt
splitting wood in the backyard

20:37.470 --> 20:39.138
for next year's
Christmas card,

20:39.205 --> 20:41.341
then I'll shave.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.611
Hi, I'm Bruce Chance.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.347
Everyone deserves a chance

20:47.414 --> 20:49.549
to get a great deal on
a mattress.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.150
But recently I've decided

20:51.217 --> 20:55.021
that some people deserve
a second chance.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.023
Hi, I'm the second chance.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.257
I'm Mike Chance.

20:58.325 --> 21:02.061
My son left home
when he was 18.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.430
Recently,
I was in a cult.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.964
It was really weird.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.966
Boy, I sure missed him.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.235
But one thing I never missed

21:09.302 --> 21:11.070
was a good night's sleep.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.605
Because you can't spell

21:12.672 --> 21:15.174
"Chance and Son Upon
a Mattress" without...

21:15.241 --> 21:17.977
BOTH: ...you, you, you!

21:20.547 --> 21:22.949
That is the worst
commercial I've ever seen.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.884
You did a good thing.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.986
Thanks.

21:27.053 --> 21:30.757
God, you people suck at
playing hide-and-go-seek.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.759
I quit.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.798
Boo-yah!
