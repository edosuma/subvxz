WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.037
Lemon-Chros family, let's not be late.

00:02.135 --> 00:03.546
Janet, shoes and socks.

00:03.636 --> 00:05.479
Okay, let go of the comic book.
Let's try and get your jacket on.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.574
Criss, shoes and socks!

00:09.676 --> 00:12.316
- Let's go, let's go!
- Don't forget these!

00:14.447 --> 00:16.393
All right.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.123
Have a good day!
Have fun at home!

00:27.560 --> 00:31.167
Any recommendations
for the best place to buy a girl's bike

00:31.264 --> 00:32.334
on the Upper West Side?

00:32.432 --> 00:34.708
She's eight.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.680
I'm sorry, what's a "girl's" bike?
Is that like a "girl" doctor?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.648
Go back to Saudi Arabia, Hitler!

00:39.739 --> 00:42.743
You're buying a bike but not a helmet?
The head is where the child's brain is!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.750
Why don't you get educated,
Double Hitler?!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.615
I was gonna buy a helmet.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.056
Helmets inhibit brain development!

00:48.148 --> 00:49.786
You might as well give
your darling child vaccines,

00:50.083 --> 00:52.290
which studies show cause homosexuality.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.490
So what?
My 2-year-old is super gay,

00:54.587 --> 00:56.396
and we love him
more than a straight child

00:56.489 --> 00:58.469
because he doesn't rape!

00:59.492 --> 01:02.166
Gentlemen, yesterday I moved
Kabletown's customer service

01:02.262 --> 01:04.572
to a part of India that has no phones.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.577
We're now providing the same level
of service to our subscribers

01:07.667 --> 01:09.078
at zero the cost.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.649
This is a Six Sigma Wheel of Domination.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.275
It's a motivational tool
I used back at GE,

01:14.374 --> 01:18.186
and it will be replacing Kabletown's,
uh, kitten in spaghetti.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.815
Once this circle is completely filled in,

01:21.114 --> 01:23.560
we will be a perfect company.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.687
And then we'll be able to get
even better trophy wives...

01:25.785 --> 01:27.423
- half-Asian ones!
- Oh.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.227
Jack Donaghy's office.

01:29.322 --> 01:32.166
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
You can't go in there!

01:32.258 --> 01:34.329
I never told you this, but I once
came up late at night looking for Jack,

01:34.427 --> 01:36.771
and you were in a wedding dress
dancing with one of his suits.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.173
Mr. Donaghy will see you now.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.577
Stay-at-home Lemon.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.809
Did you already run out of things
to do today?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.551
What? No!

01:47.640 --> 01:48.880
- You are.
- it's understandable.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.279
For the past seven years,

01:50.376 --> 01:52.481
you put out dozens of fires every day --

01:52.579 --> 01:54.650
not including the real ones
Tracy would set.

01:54.747 --> 01:57.660
To keep away Frankensteins,
which, as far as we know, worked.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.787
My point is, you need the outlet.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.162
Without work...

02:02.255 --> 02:03.632
I have plenty of new outlets.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.634
Iran this morning for 30 minutes.

02:05.725 --> 02:06.829
Does that include dry heaving?

02:06.926 --> 02:09.805
And wet! And, sure, okay, I thought
I'd have a job right now.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.172
But I don't <i>need</i> to work.

02:12.265 --> 02:15.212
What about money? You know "TGS"
is only syndicated in Greece.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.743
We'll be fine.
Criss has gone back to work.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.549
He has a degree in ethnomusicology
from Wesleyan,

02:24.644 --> 02:26.817
so he's a receptionist
at a dental office.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.790
And I didn't come here
looking for something to do.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.657
I just thought I would check in on you

02:30.750 --> 02:33.162
because you're
the emotionally fragile one.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.197
Hogcock!

02:34.287 --> 02:36.426
Which is a combination
of "hogwash" and "poppycock."

02:36.523 --> 02:38.161
I'm just saying, if my mother told me

02:38.258 --> 02:41.364
that everything I had been raised
to believe was a lie and then died,

02:41.461 --> 02:42.531
I'd be like, "Say whaaat?!"

02:42.629 --> 02:45.405
Lemon, all Colleen said
is that she wanted me to be happy,

02:45.498 --> 02:46.806
and obviously I am.

02:46.900 --> 02:47.935
Take a look at my new view.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.714
From up here,
I can see the whole island --

02:50.803 --> 02:53.181
a city built
on the religion of capitalism,

02:53.273 --> 02:54.752
and I am its high priest

02:54.841 --> 02:57.219
looking down on the swinish multitude.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.416
And even those who hate me,
the unwashed socialist horde,

03:00.513 --> 03:02.686
the Occupy Wall Streeters

03:02.782 --> 03:04.955
and the beard-havers
and the bicycle-riders,

03:05.251 --> 03:08.858
even they must acknowledge me...

03:08.955 --> 03:10.662
as a god.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.498
And this makes you... happy?

03:13.826 --> 03:15.464
It should.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.872
You know, I'm reminded
of something Yoda once said.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.910
Hmm. Ohh.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.976
Dark times are these.

Original Air Date on January 31, 2013

03:43.590 --> 03:46.969
Nakamura-san, we at NBC would
love to adapt your game show

03:47.260 --> 03:48.796
for American audiences.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.375
But we thought maybe contestants
could win money

03:51.464 --> 03:53.842
instead of penis punches.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.470
Yo, Ken, I need you
to do something for me!

03:56.569 --> 03:57.604
Ken!

03:57.704 --> 03:59.741
Tray, Ken can't do stuff for you anymore.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.944
He's president of the network now.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.348
So? He promised me he'd always
be there for me no matter what.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.446
Sometimes things change.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.755
And yet you still say
stupid stuff to me all the time

04:09.849 --> 04:12.056
and suck at carrying boxes!

04:14.587 --> 04:16.589
Hey, Kenneth!

04:16.689 --> 04:20.034
Just thought I'd come up and say hi
to the new president of NBC!

04:20.326 --> 04:24.672
Well, can I get you anything --
chickpeas, moonshine, turtle meat?

04:24.764 --> 04:25.742
I'm good.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.312
You know, I was with NBC for seven years.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.473
And even though right now
I'm concentrating on being a mom --

04:31.571 --> 04:32.879
You've always had the body for it!

04:32.972 --> 04:37.284
...at some point down the road
I do plan on getting back to work.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.857
Well, I hope it's with NBC!

04:39.946 --> 04:41.584
Because we have hiring quotas!

04:41.681 --> 04:45.060
Okay, well, I actually think
there might be a show in my life:

04:45.351 --> 04:46.989
a woman writer living in New York --

04:47.086 --> 04:48.326
Oh, sorry.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.957
"Woman," "writer," "New York."

04:50.056 --> 04:53.094
Those are all on my list
of "TV No-No Words."

04:54.294 --> 04:55.932
See, I think audiences just want to laugh

04:56.029 --> 04:58.976
and forget about their problems
when they watch TV.

04:59.065 --> 05:02.444
They don't want to watch
some angry New York crankypants...

05:02.535 --> 05:04.014
make that face! Exactly!

05:04.304 --> 05:07.717
I want to make shows
that people actually want to watch!

05:07.807 --> 05:10.981
Shows where a guy gets a drink
thrown in his face

05:11.077 --> 05:15.856
and then he turns to his dog
and says, "Don't. Even. Say it."

05:15.948 --> 05:17.985
Giggles 1 To his dog!

05:18.084 --> 05:20.928
Okay, well, I think TV can be successful

05:21.020 --> 05:23.057
without sacrificing quality.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.393
- Tsk-tsk-tsk!
- Ah, there it is.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.334
Okay, well, if that's what you want,

05:27.427 --> 05:29.634
maybe I shouldn't bring my ideas to NBC.

05:29.729 --> 05:30.571
I'll go to cable,

05:30.663 --> 05:33.405
where you can swear and really
take time to let moments la--

05:33.499 --> 05:35.877
You will never believe
what just happened to me!

05:35.968 --> 05:37.948
I was throwing a tantrum
in the makeup room...

05:38.037 --> 05:39.846
Where is my color?!

05:39.939 --> 05:42.476
I will have you queens fired!

05:42.575 --> 05:45.556
I will tell the other gays
your real ages!

05:45.645 --> 05:47.955
I'll be...

05:48.047 --> 05:49.856
ignored by my friends?

05:49.949 --> 05:52.793
No one paid any attention to --

05:52.885 --> 05:54.956
Stop ignoring me!

05:55.054 --> 05:57.364
This is an actor announcement!

05:57.457 --> 06:00.563
The show's over, so you're not
technically an actor anymore.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.367
How dare you, you rotting pear?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.442
I will stop being an actress

06:04.530 --> 06:07.477
when the Earth stops spinning
on Kabbalah Monster's fingernail.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.979
The only thing that's "stopping"
is this show.

06:10.069 --> 06:10.979
It's beneath me.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.845
And from now on,

06:12.939 --> 06:16.079
Jenna Maroney only plays dramatic roles.

06:16.175 --> 06:20.021
Good-bye forever,
you factory-reject dildos.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.023
Mr. Donaghy?!

06:26.119 --> 06:29.100
Inga, you have to warn me
when we have an important guest.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.460
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to spank you again!

06:34.427 --> 06:35.929
Stupid Jonathan.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.837
Kenneth, I need your advice.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.568
Sir, I know this is my office,

06:39.665 --> 06:42.805
but it would make me more
comfortable if we switched places.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.686
Kenneth, I've been thinking
about something a lot lately,

06:49.776 --> 06:52.552
something that's never bothered me
until now.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.626
Me too!
Where are all the baby pigeons?

06:55.715 --> 06:59.492
Happiness.
I've started to wonder if I'm happy.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.089
Well, sir, if you have to ask, then...
you're not.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.691
It's like when a pig says,

07:04.791 --> 07:08.568
"if I can communicate with you
telepathically, do I have a soul?"

07:08.661 --> 07:12.006
And then you're like, "No. Duh!
Into the slaughtering chute!"

07:12.098 --> 07:15.545
If you're right, I have a problem.
And every problem can be solved.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.046
As I was taught in Six Sigma:

07:17.136 --> 07:19.446
Analyze, Strategize, Succeed --

07:19.539 --> 07:21.075
A.S.S.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.621
I'm going to crush this problem...

07:24.710 --> 07:26.587
with my ASS.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.484
Tracy Jordan to see Ken Tucky Derby.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.120
Mr. Parcell's in a meeting.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.197
I see.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.158
Very well.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.167
Tell him Tracy came by from his promise.

07:38.257 --> 07:41.033
That's Tracy -- "T" as in the drink.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.697
"R" as in the pirate noise.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.832
"A" as in the Fonzie noise.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.467
"C" as in sea monster.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.170
"Y" as in "Why do we even make friends

07:48.267 --> 07:50.747
if they're gonna let you down
when we need them the most?"

07:50.837 --> 07:52.510
Last name: Jordan.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.551
"J" as in the birds I'm afraid of...

07:59.946 --> 08:01.983
I'm a stay-at-home mom

08:02.081 --> 08:04.994
who until recently
had a high-pressure job.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.530
Any advice on dealing
with that transition?

08:07.620 --> 08:09.793
I put all my old work energy
into parenting.

08:09.889 --> 08:12.870
My kids hate me!
Which gives me more parenting to do!

08:12.959 --> 08:16.532
Oh, my God, I'm so sick of listening
to you stay-at-home moms whine.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.199
Try being a working parent.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.208
I did. But I got fired.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.535
For stupidity.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.081
I'd switch places with any of you.
And I have amazing cheekbones.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.149
Original poster:

08:26.239 --> 08:28.913
For your information,
some people like work.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.648
Really? You like having
40 emails from Jerry,

08:31.744 --> 08:33.655
all with a red exclamation point?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.953
Oh, they're all urgent, Jerry?!

08:36.048 --> 08:39.518
Some people think that work
is fulfilling and validating.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.724
For example, the rapper T.I.,

08:41.821 --> 08:44.232
who wrote,
"Better get on yo' job, tell 'em,

08:44.323 --> 08:46.826
haters get on yo' job, nougats."

08:46.926 --> 08:48.803
At least I think he was saying "nougats."

08:48.895 --> 08:51.739
Well, I don't know what to say.
I guess "some people" are idiots.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.674
Bitch, you are on my last nerve!

08:53.766 --> 08:55.006
Then why don't you do something about it?

08:55.101 --> 08:57.741
Gladly, friend-o.
Riverside Park.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.908
Hippo Playground.
10 minutes.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.680
Perfect. I take my darling children
there all the time.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.051
I'll be the one wearing a purple sweater

09:05.144 --> 09:08.557
and wrapping a baby swing
around some skank's neck.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.930
Time for an ASS attack.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.302
Kabletown shares
closing at a new high today.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.166
CEO Jack Donaghy,
who rang the opening bell last week,

09:25.264 --> 09:27.938
has emphasized
the growth potential in the...

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
Now I am the sensei!

09:32.338 --> 09:34.841
The parking space
closest to the door is mine!

09:38.711 --> 09:42.158
What do we have here?

09:49.288 --> 09:52.098
Joining us this hour
is my new co-host, The Colonel.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.603
Looks like another cold one today
in the Midwest.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.264
So bundle up, everyone.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.603
And if you can, get hit by a car.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.644
You get to spend a couple days
in the hospital,

10:00.733 --> 10:02.110
and they give you soup.

10:02.201 --> 10:06.707
# This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine #

10:06.806 --> 10:11.619
# This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine #

10:13.713 --> 10:15.750
Nancy, I know this is unconventional,

10:15.848 --> 10:18.829
but I really think
a group relationship could work.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.057
What you're proposin' is a sin, Jack.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.723
But she is wicked hot.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.893
Elisa, what do you say?

10:24.991 --> 10:28.768
It would have to be a conjugal visit
because I am in a Puerto Rican jail.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.774
Jenna, thank you so much for doing this.

10:37.870 --> 10:38.746
What a thrill!

10:38.838 --> 10:42.115
Oh, I am just so glad
to finally return to my two loves --

10:42.208 --> 10:44.654
dramatic acting and sex crimes!

10:44.744 --> 10:47.884
Well, this first scene is super simple.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.982
Munch and Fin find your body --

10:50.082 --> 10:51.220
Wait, what?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.318
I die?

10:52.418 --> 10:53.863
Didn't you get the rewrite?

10:53.953 --> 10:56.092
But if I'm dead, how can I become
a recurring character?

10:56.188 --> 10:57.394
And if I'm not a recurring character,

10:57.690 --> 11:00.364
how will I get away
with horrible stuff like this?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.199
Let's do this!

11:02.294 --> 11:03.830
That's what I was about to say!

11:04.797 --> 11:05.867
Let's do it!

11:05.965 --> 11:07.273
Slate it!

11:07.366 --> 11:09.141
And... action!

11:11.404 --> 11:15.352
Word is, cleaning lady
found her early this morning.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.886
Still alive.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.080
Who else had access?

11:18.177 --> 11:21.852
Ow, my foot hurts, but I'm okay!

11:21.947 --> 11:25.861
I think this injury has given me
crime-solving powers!

11:25.951 --> 11:28.955
It's "Law & Order, Colon, Mind Beauty"!

11:29.055 --> 11:30.398
I'm done.
Who is this chick?

11:30.489 --> 11:32.435
All television is beneath me!

11:32.725 --> 11:34.796
I will only do cinema!

11:34.894 --> 11:35.770
No one cares, Jenna!

11:35.861 --> 11:39.741
I am going to the City of Angels,
a veterinary hospital

11:39.832 --> 11:42.438
where I get dog sedatives
that help me relax when I fly.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.113
Then I'm flying to Los Angeles!

11:45.204 --> 11:49.380
Good-bye forever, you soup line
at a gay homeless shelter!

11:55.715 --> 11:58.389
Crisstopher Rick Chros.
Are you kidding me?

11:58.484 --> 11:59.861
Liz, you don't want to be here right now,

11:59.952 --> 12:01.761
'cause I gotta go smack that woman
in the face!

12:01.854 --> 12:04.334
Criss... you're here to fight me!

12:04.423 --> 12:06.266
I'm the original poster!

12:06.358 --> 12:08.065
Oh, my God!
Since when do you listen to T.I.?!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.299
That message board is for moms.
I thought you were a lady.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.433
You said you had "amazing cheekbones!"

12:14.500 --> 12:16.104
- Chros, what are you doing here?
- I don't know.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.773
I just hate being at work.
Sitting at a desk makes me crazy.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.078
I keep getting up and getting coffee.
Now I'm all jittery and weird --

12:21.173 --> 12:22.151
Bird!

12:22.241 --> 12:23.879
So, you hate work.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.183
And this mom came in with her kids
to see Dr. Emily,

12:26.278 --> 12:27.450
and I was jealous of her.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.852
Her kids were so bored,
I just wanted to jump over that divider

12:29.949 --> 12:32.395
and play waiting games with them,
like Carpet Adventure!

12:32.485 --> 12:34.021
Or that one where your hands are spiders.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.394
Hand Spiders!

12:35.488 --> 12:38.765
Yeah, so, I hate work,
and evidently you miss it.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.428
I know.
I'm a terrible mother.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.302
Oh, my God. If you were a dude,
you would not even be thinking that.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.807
It's okay to want to work.
One of us has to.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.104
We just got it backwards.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.406
You're... the dad.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.483
I do like ignoring your questions
while I try to watch TV.

12:52.571 --> 12:54.812
Exactly! I should be the one
staying at home.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.409
You should be in an office.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.182
It's how our family is supposed to work.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.484
Except I don't have an office
to go back to.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.856
So, pitch something to Kenneth,
like -- I don't know --

13:03.949 --> 13:06.395
a show about a dentist's office,
where the <i>sassy</i> hygienist

13:06.485 --> 13:09.329
says things like,
"I'm turning 30... again."

13:11.190 --> 13:12.533
I will miss Tyrell.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.829
You know, that's exactly the kind
of garbage that Kenneth is looking for.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.841
And, for the sake of my family,
I'm gonna give it to him.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.976
Damn it, why did I get
such a loud pacemaker?!

13:29.074 --> 13:30.382
Tray, Kenneth is not coming.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.454
You think I don't know that?!

13:31.544 --> 13:33.455
When I went up to Ken's office earlier,

13:33.546 --> 13:36.459
I saw his schedule
on his assistant's pornography box.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.994
- You mean computer?
- Whatever!

13:38.083 --> 13:40.427
He doesn't have meetings.
He's avoiding me!

13:40.519 --> 13:42.430
What am I, my son's piano recital?!

13:42.521 --> 13:44.364
Put yourself in Kenneth's shoes.

13:44.456 --> 13:47.562
I can't! He's not here!
Stop torturing me!

13:47.860 --> 13:49.032
He's running the network.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.005
He doesn't need you asking him for stuff.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.541
Whatever it is you need, we can do it.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.073
Unless you need us to hate
the new Taylor Swift album.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.339
That girl has feelings.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.609
You're wrong, Dot Com!
What I need, only Kenneth can do!

13:59.905 --> 14:01.441
Only Kenneth!

14:01.540 --> 14:04.316
We were doing just fine
before Kenneth ever got here!

14:04.410 --> 14:05.616
Just fine!

14:09.281 --> 14:10.316
You wanted to see me, sir?

14:10.416 --> 14:13.397
Kenneth, since we last spoke,
I've been in a spiral --

14:13.485 --> 14:14.555
an upward spiral.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.299
Oh, that's not a thing.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.594
Neither is talking two Catholic beauties

14:17.890 --> 14:20.393
into a delicious
vanilla-caramel sex swirl,

14:20.492 --> 14:22.870
but I did it...
and I got rid of their accents.

14:22.962 --> 14:23.963
Oh, Jack,

14:24.063 --> 14:26.304
porking in that prison basement
was wicked awesome.

14:26.398 --> 14:30.107
Oh, thank you, you two,
for blowing my brains.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.408
So who's happy now, Parcell?

14:31.503 --> 14:33.574
Well, if you have to ask the question --

14:33.672 --> 14:34.582
And answer it.

14:34.673 --> 14:38.018
I am, you string cheese
with a tooth stuck in it!

14:38.110 --> 14:38.645
Look at the Wheel!

14:38.944 --> 14:41.515
- Well, then, smile, Mr. Donaghy!
- I am!

14:41.614 --> 14:45.323
Jack, you are gonna love this,
you magnificent bastard!

14:45.417 --> 14:46.623
Someone leaked your new salary.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.229
Occupy Wall Street
is having a conniption!

14:49.321 --> 14:51.164
- Really?
- They burned you in effigy!

14:51.257 --> 14:52.634
The hair went up like a Roman candle!

14:52.925 --> 14:55.098
And the Democrats, they don't even
know what to do with themselves!

14:55.194 --> 14:56.673
Just look at this jackass.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.101
Jack Donaghy is an economic war criminal.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.337
If the Democratic Party
controlled Congress,

15:01.433 --> 15:04.607
I would see to it that he was punished
in the worst way possible --

15:04.703 --> 15:07.650
by having to come down here
and listen to us.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.511
God, I feel like I have
a macropenis right now!

15:25.724 --> 15:28.000
Ms. Lemon, how funny!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.095
I was planning to call you,
and now here you are!

15:31.096 --> 15:32.973
Now, about our conversation earlier --

15:33.065 --> 15:33.475
Yes, about that.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.442
You know, I've been thinking,
and you were right.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.309
America doesn't want to see me.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.644
America wants to see...

15:39.738 --> 15:41.012
John Hardly.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.382
He loves his family,
but he hates the rat race.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.477
He's... "Hardly Working."

15:45.577 --> 15:47.420
I'm so sorry, pass.

15:47.513 --> 15:51.359
But I do have something
you'd be perfect for.

15:51.450 --> 15:55.262
One last chance for "TGS"
to make America say, "What? Why?"

15:55.354 --> 15:57.095
What are you talking about?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.260
Well, it turns out
Mr. Jordan's "TGS" contract

15:59.358 --> 16:02.202
contains some rather unusual clauses.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.332
And I don't mean those two Santas
I saw kissing on the subway.

16:05.431 --> 16:09.402
"If fewer than 150 episodes of 'TGS'
are produced in total,

16:09.501 --> 16:13.108
Mr. Jordan shall be paid
a penalty of $30 million."

16:13.205 --> 16:14.183
So?

16:14.273 --> 16:18.653
Ms. Lemon, "TGS" has done 149 shows.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.520
So we're gonna need you to go ahead
and do one more.

16:21.613 --> 16:25.288
I need a job, Kenneth,
not one more episode of "TGS".

16:25.384 --> 16:27.386
You are contractually required
to write and produce

16:27.486 --> 16:29.124
all episodes of "TGS".

16:29.221 --> 16:31.030
So, see you tomorrow?

16:31.123 --> 16:33.125
Wow.
You've really changed, Kenneth.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.102
I don't think so.
You look nice today!

16:35.194 --> 16:37.333
Shut your chin slit.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.669
Yes' ma'am!

16:38.764 --> 16:42.109
Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

16:42.201 --> 16:46.581
Follow yellow signs to baggage claim
and ground transportation.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.460
Excuse me, ma'am, do you need
a wheelchair to baggage claim?

17:03.322 --> 17:05.700
Shut it down.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.034
I will return to my first love --
Broadway!

17:09.728 --> 17:13.767
You Eastern-European-knockoff
Mr. Potato Heads!

17:15.200 --> 17:16.577
Why haven't you come to see me?!

17:16.667 --> 17:18.772
Why didn't you return any of my calls?!

17:19.070 --> 17:21.142
I tried, sir, but no one answered.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.345
I'm Tracy Jordan!
I don't answer phones!

17:23.442 --> 17:25.319
Kenneth, you once made a promise

17:25.411 --> 17:27.357
that you would always be there for me.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.256
I know. I'm sorry.
I would never break a promise.

17:30.349 --> 17:32.829
Good, 'cause I need you
to do something for me.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.222
Of course. Just name it!

17:34.319 --> 17:36.663
Kenneth, I need you
to take back your promise.

17:36.755 --> 17:37.825
Sir?

17:38.123 --> 17:39.534
I know what it is to blow up overnight.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.263
And I'm not talking about my gout.

17:41.360 --> 17:45.308
When I got big, a lot of people
from my past wanted stuff from me,

17:45.397 --> 17:46.740
and, well...

17:46.832 --> 17:49.312
I don't want to be that person for you.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.575
So, like the snakes I kept
in my dressing room,

17:52.671 --> 17:53.706
I release you.

17:55.841 --> 17:56.683
Mr. Jordan...

18:00.245 --> 18:01.553
Thank you, sir!

18:03.315 --> 18:05.158
I think I'm gonna need a tissue.

18:10.222 --> 18:11.792
Am I supposed to drop this on the floor?

18:13.358 --> 18:14.837
And while we're naming things,

18:15.127 --> 18:18.233
my car ran out of gas
on the Long Island Expressway.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.809
Yes, sir.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.641
Okay, Jack, I need a job.
I'm looking for six figures --

18:27.739 --> 18:30.242
eight if you're counting cents,
which I fell for once before.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.582
Not cool, The Gap!

18:31.677 --> 18:33.884
I'd love to help you, Lemon,
but I don't think I can.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.887
I resigned as CEO of Kabletown
an hour ago.

18:37.182 --> 18:37.887
What? Why?

18:38.183 --> 18:39.787
Because I felt nothing.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.865
I got the job, I pissed off my enemies --

18:42.154 --> 18:44.191
Pelosi, Maddow, Baldwin.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.200
It should have been
the greatest moment of my life.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.795
No-no-no, no, no!
Eyes off the window!

18:49.895 --> 18:52.341
Focus on Lemon.
What am I gonna do now?

18:52.431 --> 18:53.774
I could try and help you --

18:53.866 --> 18:57.336
make some calls and see
what bridges I haven't burned --

18:57.436 --> 18:58.676
but I'm not going to,

18:58.770 --> 18:59.840
for your own good.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.214
Work is never going
to make you happy, Lemon.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.412
And anyone who tells you differently
is a fool.

19:04.510 --> 19:05.682
Are you kidding me?!

19:05.777 --> 19:08.189
What have we been talking about
for the last seven years?!

19:08.280 --> 19:09.190
I don't know anymore.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.887
For the first time in my life,
I don't know what I need.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.424
Maybe I'll buy a boat.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.261
Oh, my God.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.801
This whole time you've been
telling me how to run my life,

19:18.891 --> 19:20.461
you didn't know
what you were talking about.

19:20.559 --> 19:23.301
You're just an alcoholic
with a great voice.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.874
Careful, Lemon.
You're playing with fire.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.542
You made me buy into this whole life!

19:27.633 --> 19:30.375
When I met you, I was perfectly happy
with what I had --

19:30.469 --> 19:33.678
eating night cheese and transitioning
my pajamas into daywear.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.252
You're the one who told me to want more.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.878
And now, when I need you most,
you are bailing on me?!

19:38.977 --> 19:41.321
You're an adult, Lemon.
You didn't have to listen to me.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.222
Really?!
When was that an option?!

19:43.315 --> 19:45.852
Look, if you want someone to blame,
blame yourself.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.363
You're the one
who wormed your way into my brain

19:48.453 --> 19:50.626
with your endless hand-wringing
and feelings.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.703
I used to be a shark,
and then you un-shark-ulated me.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.432
I called you up here for one meeting
seven years ago,

19:56.528 --> 19:58.530
and you kept coming up!

19:59.731 --> 20:03.406
So we ruined each other.
Good to know.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.778
You know, it's for the best
that my show is over

20:05.871 --> 20:08.647
and you've quit
and we're all going our separate ways.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.346
I guess you and I
were just a boss and his employee.

20:11.443 --> 20:12.717
And now we're not anymore.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.314
Yes, that pretty much sums it up.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.486
There!
You're no longer special to him!

20:18.584 --> 20:21.463
Get out!
Get out of our lives!

20:21.553 --> 20:24.227
Yes!

20:31.897 --> 20:32.841
Put your helmet on, Pete.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.604
This last episode is gonna be a hot mess.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.235
How so?

20:35.334 --> 20:38.713
If "TGS" doesn't do one more show,
Tracy gets $30 million.

20:38.804 --> 20:39.475
Oh, NBC.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.552
The same company that suggested
we get flush buddies to save water.

20:42.641 --> 20:43.881
Liz, Tracy has landed.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.580
Of course he has, because if he didn't --

20:45.677 --> 20:47.657
He'd be in breach of contract
and wouldn't get the money.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.590
Which means he's gonna try to find
another way to ruin the show.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.925
Seven years, and Tracy never changed.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.897
Well, people are who they are, Liz.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.996
This is
Dan Silversmith with Carolina Mutual.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.603
I can't talk right now.
I'm with a customer.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.934
Well, whatever sideways nonsense
Tracy tries to pull,

21:08.033 --> 21:09.512
I'm gonna hold him down.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.377
I'm gonna hold him down like
that machine Kathy Geiss invented

21:12.471 --> 21:13.677
that hugs old people.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.945
My God, this will change
elder care forever.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.418
Whoops. Nope.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.388
Hello, Tracy.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.950
So, one last show.
Pretty crazy, huh?

21:25.050 --> 21:27.894
Indeed, Elizabeth.
I hope nothing goes wrong.

21:27.986 --> 21:28.691
Why would it?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.698
I mean, you're here,
fulfilling your contract.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.995
Sure am, L.L.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.737
The only thing that can stop this show
is an act of God.

21:34.826 --> 21:35.896
Or if some genius figured out a way

21:35.994 --> 21:42.377
to staaaalllll juuuuusssst
lonnnnnng eeeeenoughhhhh --

21:42.467 --> 21:43.707
No! Nice try!

21:43.802 --> 21:44.940
Get that out of here!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.539
It's the final showdown, Tray.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.049
You're gonna have to do better than that.

21:48.340 --> 21:51.480
The night is young, and neither are you.

21:58.417 --> 22:01.591
Okay. Thank you, everybody,
for coming in on such short notice.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.667
I know some of you
have already gotten other jobs.

22:03.755 --> 22:04.961
Not me.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.468
Anyway...

22:06.558 --> 22:09.368
We have been given
a second chance to end this right,

22:09.461 --> 22:10.462
on our terms.

22:10.562 --> 22:14.100
So... what are we going to order
for our last free lunch?

22:14.399 --> 22:15.469
- Momofuku!
- Guy Fieri's restaurant ironically!

22:15.567 --> 22:16.705
Nothing, thank you.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.782
Cerie, whose turn is it
to choose lunch today?

22:18.870 --> 22:21.077
Who is... The Picker?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.443
You picked last time, Liz.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.750
So, alphabetically after "Lemon" comes --

22:25.844 --> 22:28.051
Oh, no.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.588
Blimpie's!

22:36.121 --> 22:38.465
- Come on, Lutz!
- Solve this, Frank!

22:40.625 --> 22:42.536
Hello, Lemon.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.504
What are you doing here?
I thought you quit.

22:44.596 --> 22:48.567
In the cushions of my couch
I found this customer-loyalty card

22:48.667 --> 22:50.010
to a place called Blazer Barn.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.376
I assume it's yours.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.107
Thank you.

22:52.404 --> 22:55.010
It's Manhattan's largest
out-of-business women's blazer dump.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.586
Look, I didn't like the way
we ended things yesterday.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.021
Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.150
I'm sorry we argued,
but I'm not myself lately.

23:03.448 --> 23:06.019
L-I quit the job I worked
my entire life to get

23:06.118 --> 23:08.462
and now I feel... adrift.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.691
No! We're not doing this.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.529
Today is the last "TGS" ever.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.536
The point is, I'm going away,
probably for a long time.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.106
I assume that's code
for a billionaire soul-searching trip

23:17.396 --> 23:18.841
to Tan Penis Island.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.432
Have fun.

23:20.532 --> 23:23.103
We're at the end here, Lemon.
We shouldn't hold grudges.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.447
For your information,

23:29.541 --> 23:34.115
most of Tan Penis Island
was destroyed in Sting's house fire.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.753
...are encouraged to take
this storm severely seriously.

23:39.851 --> 23:41.125
Wait, where are you guys going?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.593
Sorry, Liz. We gotta get out of here
before the roads close.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.099
There's a snowicane coming!

23:45.190 --> 23:47.602
...especially midtown Manhattan

23:47.692 --> 23:50.138
between Saks Fifth Avenue
and the Variety Deli.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.841
Oh, no!
That's right where We are!

23:52.931 --> 23:54.569
According to
the National Weather Service,

23:54.666 --> 23:56.077
you should, and I quote,

23:56.168 --> 23:58.808
"Leave work, get in your purple Bentley,

23:58.904 --> 24:00.884
and be home with your sharks"

24:00.972 --> 24:03.953
before the tri-state area gets slammed
by what is being called

24:04.042 --> 24:09.685
Snowicane White Lady Name
Like Dorva Or Something.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.692
Everybody back to work!

24:11.783 --> 24:13.456
Aw, jeez!

24:15.220 --> 24:17.029
What did you do to Al Roker
to make him to do that?

24:17.122 --> 24:19.762
Let's just say his wife is
on the board of a children's hospital,

24:19.858 --> 24:22.134
and they need a celebrity
to host their annual gala,

24:22.227 --> 24:23.570
and I threatened to do it!

24:23.662 --> 24:25.733
Do you understand
how selfish you're being?

24:25.831 --> 24:27.708
Our crew has been together
for seven years,

24:27.799 --> 24:29.904
and tonight is everyone's chance
to say good-bye.

24:30.001 --> 24:33.141
So get up on that stage and cut the B.S.!

24:33.238 --> 24:36.583
But I promised Barbra Streisand
I'd never stab her again!

24:38.810 --> 24:40.153
Jenna...

24:40.245 --> 24:42.657
you've been friends with Lemon
for a long time.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.784
- She and I had an argument yesterday.
- Really?

24:44.883 --> 24:47.989
Did Liz scream in your face?
Did you pin her up against the wall?

24:48.086 --> 24:49.895
Were your shirts wet with rain?

24:49.988 --> 24:51.797
I mean, obviously we've had
disagreements before,

24:51.890 --> 24:53.733
but this... feels different.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.705
After tonight, I feel like Lemon and I
could go our separate ways

24:57.796 --> 25:00.072
and never see each other again.
Is that crazy?

25:00.165 --> 25:03.203
Not really. You know Liz.
She can hold a grudge.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.981
She did want me to cancel "Top Chef"

25:05.070 --> 25:06.640
because Colicchids lunch place

25:06.738 --> 25:08.513
changed the toppings
on her favorite salad.

25:08.607 --> 25:09.984
And with people, forget about it.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.782
She's never stayed friends with an ex.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.756
When Conan dumped her,
she dropped him forever.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.224
Hey, Liz.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.525
Come on, you can't pretend I don't exist!

25:22.621 --> 25:24.897
We dated for a year!

25:24.990 --> 25:27.698
We were gonna lose our virginity
to each other!

25:27.792 --> 25:29.931
Now I'll never lose it!

25:31.997 --> 25:35.171
And her friends?
She'll cut people off for doing nothing.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.248
I'm afraid to even tell her that I
Frenched her dad on New Year's.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.143
I don't know what to do.
I've lost so much already.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.241
The past few months
have been really hard.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.748
And now Lemon!

25:44.843 --> 25:48.256
Did the doctor that prescribes
your antidepressants go to jail, too?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.891
You see, I don't have
that many people in my life.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.292
I spent Christmas alone in the Hamptons,

25:53.585 --> 25:58.261
drinking Scotch and throwing
firecrackers at Billy Joel's dog!

26:00.225 --> 26:01.863
I'm just in a really bad place,

26:01.960 --> 26:03.940
and I don't know
how much more I can take!

26:05.630 --> 26:08.304
Daddy, please stop crying!

26:12.971 --> 26:15.042
I printed out the Blimpie's menu.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.177
Okay, how about this?

26:17.275 --> 26:19.346
Yesterday, a bunch of us came in
to clean out our desks,

26:19.644 --> 26:20.850
more than half of us.

26:20.946 --> 26:21.924
Yes! A quorum!

26:22.013 --> 26:24.289
And you weren't here, Lutz.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.029
And lunch rule precedent stipulates
that disputes will be resolved

26:27.118 --> 26:28.654
by picking a new name.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.733
Toofer, the can!

26:30.822 --> 26:32.802
Gladly.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.603
What the hell? It's stuck to me.
Oh, God! And it's Lutz!

26:38.697 --> 26:40.301
Why is it so sticky?!

26:40.599 --> 26:41.907
I wrote it on flypaper.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.948
I'm five steps ahead of you,
you sons of bitches!

26:46.037 --> 26:47.072
Blimpie's!

26:47.172 --> 26:49.243
Liz, have you seen Jack today?

26:49.341 --> 26:52.720
He just came into my dressing room
and started crying.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.313
He's in a really bad place.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.819
Like when Mickey Rourke --

26:55.914 --> 26:58.793
Okay, I can't do this anymore.
I've never met Mickey Rourke.

26:59.818 --> 27:01.729
What do you want me to do, Jenna --

27:01.820 --> 27:04.232
shut down the show to make Jack
feel better about bailing on me?

27:04.322 --> 27:07.064
I'm just really worried.
And if you won't do anything, I will.

27:07.158 --> 27:08.364
On behalf of the network, Ms. Maroney,

27:08.660 --> 27:10.640
I think you should sing
at the end of the show tonight.

27:10.729 --> 27:13.073
Wonderful!
I'll need 10 pianos.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.734
Good luck with, uh, Jake!

27:14.833 --> 27:16.676
Does everybody have to be crazy today?!

27:16.768 --> 27:17.906
Beloved coworkers!

27:18.003 --> 27:19.641
Oh, life.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.046
It goes by so fast.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.379
We barely look at each other.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.416
I didn't realize all this was going on!

27:25.710 --> 27:27.712
Good-bye.
Good-bye, world.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.986
Good-bye, Long Hair Guy.
Good-bye, Richard Esposito.

27:31.082 --> 27:34.325
Go home to your wife
and eight beautiful children.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.921
You're all so beautiful.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.126
What the what?

27:40.091 --> 27:41.195
Um, guys?

27:41.292 --> 27:42.896
I know I don't normally say much, but --

27:42.994 --> 27:44.701
What, woman?! Speak!

27:44.796 --> 27:47.367
Well, officially the show
was cancelled two weeks ago.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.010
So isn't this technically season eight?

27:50.101 --> 27:54.072
Which means we start over
at the beginning of the alphabet!

27:54.172 --> 27:55.947
So the new Picker is...

27:56.041 --> 27:57.349
- Me!
- What?! No!

27:57.442 --> 27:59.115
"Lutz" isn't first!

28:02.147 --> 28:04.388
You changed your name to "Aardvark"?!

28:04.683 --> 28:05.718
That's insane!

28:05.817 --> 28:08.127
Shhhhhhh.

28:08.219 --> 28:11.359
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.764
Blimpie's.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.403
So, have you picked out a song
for tonight, Ms. Maroney?

28:18.697 --> 28:19.437
A perfect song!

28:19.731 --> 28:24.441
As I'm sure you know, I have returned
to my first love, Broadway,

28:24.736 --> 28:29.481
in a musical adaptation of the film
of the novel "The Rural Juror".

28:29.774 --> 28:30.980
- I'm sorry, the what?
- At the end of Act Two...

28:31.076 --> 28:34.023
my character, Constance Justice,
sings the title song.

28:34.112 --> 28:38.720
It's a tearful goodbye to her true love,
Norman Blurder, the Rural Juror.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.023
It sounds emotional!

28:40.118 --> 28:41.324
Listen to this.

28:41.419 --> 28:46.994
# I will never forget you, rural juror! #

28:47.092 --> 28:48.969
What? What is that face?

28:49.060 --> 28:52.439
I don't know, Ms. Maroney.
It just seems like you're faking it.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.007
Well, of course I am.
I'm an ac-tor.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.377
And acting is all cheap tricks
that any child or monkey could do.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.814
To act drunk, you just wear
two different size heels.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.944
And to cry, you just clutch
a shard of broken glass.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.887
Ms. Maroney, this is the end of "TGS".

29:07.979 --> 29:10.255
You need to show real emotion.

29:10.348 --> 29:11.520
Hmm.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.261
Real emotion.

29:13.351 --> 29:14.989
It's not really my thing.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.066
Maybe if I had something to be sad about.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.190
Are you kidding?

29:18.289 --> 29:21.532
After tonight, you may not see
any of us ever again.

29:21.826 --> 29:24.773
Stop trying to cheer me up!
I need to feel sad!

29:24.863 --> 29:25.898
Then I guess you'll have to figure out

29:25.997 --> 29:28.534
something that you'll miss
about this place.

29:28.833 --> 29:32.508
But maybe it's not a thing
so much as a person.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.078
Well, that's not going to be easy,
Kenneth,

29:34.172 --> 29:36.448
considering I'm the only person
who works here.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.781
Why are you wearing that weird necklace?

29:41.880 --> 29:44.053
I always wear this.
I want to be buried in it.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.356
So, if anything ever happens to me
and you can't find my body

29:46.451 --> 29:49.125
but you can find this,
don't overthink it.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.325
Just bury the necklace and move on.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.060
Okay. Why are you wearing Jack's watch?

29:53.158 --> 29:54.831
Oh, that's not part of it.
Jack just gave this to me.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.997
He's been giving his stuff away all day.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.165
I want you to have this bag of my hair.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.571
Why is he acting so crazy?

29:59.864 --> 30:02.811
He's crying one minute, happy
the next, giving away all his stuff.

30:02.901 --> 30:05.142
Sounds like someone's got a case
of the ol' kablooeys.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.546
We've all been there.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.409
You think Jack Donaghy's
gonna kill himself? No way.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.919
Jack has never quit anything in his life.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.184
- That's for you.
- Except his dream job... yesterday.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.588
Thing is, any fool can kill himself.
You know what a real man does?

30:20.885 --> 30:22.887
Fakes his own death.
But you gotta be smart.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.365
Plan it slowly over eight or nine years.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.434
And then, when it's "go time,"

30:26.524 --> 30:28.526
no big withdrawals
from your bank account.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.535
Instead, the day before it goes down,
you <i>deposit</i> $70.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.300
Why would a guy planning to fake
his death <i>deposit</i> $70? He wouldn't!

30:35.400 --> 30:36.936
What the hell are you talking about?!

30:38.169 --> 30:39.512
Oh, sorry. Work.

30:39.604 --> 30:40.947
Y'all get my fax?

30:41.039 --> 30:42.382
Elizabeth.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.384
Sweet, funny Elizabeth.

30:44.475 --> 30:46.921
Your light always shone
the brightest, baby.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.154
You're coming to the show tonight, right?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.160
I'll be watching.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.959
Not sure from where,
but I'll be with you... in spirit.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.462
Weird!

31:04.062 --> 31:06.565
Come on, Tray, leave the dancers alone.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.570
What's going on?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.504
Why aren't you smiling bravely
while Tracy tells you

31:09.601 --> 31:11.410
your butt looks like two slippery hams?

31:12.437 --> 31:15.043
Where's Tracy?!

31:15.139 --> 31:16.550
We have no idea, Liz.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.416
I've been so distracted lately.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.453
Grizz just found out his uncle

31:19.544 --> 31:21.524
left him a bed and breakfast
outside Santa Fe.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.456
I'm gonna be a real fish out of water!

31:23.548 --> 31:25.186
What are you talking about?

31:25.283 --> 31:27.285
What is that?!
Does everyone see that?!

31:28.486 --> 31:31.296
Okay! Whatever!
I know you know where Tracy is!

31:31.389 --> 31:33.460
Did he promise you
some of the $30 million?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.038
- Yes, $1 million.
- Yes, $20,000.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.299
Wait, what?!

31:37.395 --> 31:40.569
Okay, that's it! Tray is exactly
where you think he is, Liz.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.373
It's the closest thing he has
to hiding out in a church.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.539
Gasps 1 Oh.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.077
It's 5:00!
Where the frak is our lunch?!

31:50.174 --> 31:52.415
We can't break him, Liz.
He's not human!

31:52.510 --> 31:54.922
Why are you doing this to us?!

31:55.013 --> 31:56.287
I'll tell you why!

31:56.381 --> 31:59.055
Because for seven years,
you have yelled at me

31:59.150 --> 32:01.187
and turned the lights out on me
when I was in the bathroom

32:01.286 --> 32:03.197
and written on me while I was sleeping

32:03.288 --> 32:04.266
'cause I was Lutz --

32:04.355 --> 32:09.065
dumb, old, uncool, part-Inuit, bisexual,
51-year-old Lutz.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.162
Well, today, I am The Picker!

32:11.262 --> 32:14.300
And I want you to feel what I've felt
for the last seven years --

32:14.399 --> 32:17.710
anger and disappointment and regret!

32:18.002 --> 32:21.950
And when that sandwich slides
out of you in a week, look at it!

32:22.040 --> 32:25.453
Because that is Lutz's revenge!

32:25.543 --> 32:28.990
Cerie, for lunch today,
I would like to pick Blimpie's.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.390
No! No!

32:34.085 --> 32:35.996
Cerie, sushi from Nobu 57,

32:36.087 --> 32:37.657
dessert from "Make My Cake" in Harlem.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.492
I'll be back... I hope.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.370
# We are young! #

32:49.467 --> 32:51.674
Yeah, you're not that young, either.
Get down, please.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.508
Give it up for Liz Lemon, everybody --
the least molested person in here.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.521
I don't even get your play here, Tray.
You're in breach now.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.454
You stay here, you don't get the money.

33:02.547 --> 33:05.460
If you think it's about the money,
you're even dumber than I look.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.257
So you're just doing this
for no reason at all,

33:07.352 --> 33:10.094
for the fun of ruining
everyone's chance to say good-bye?

33:10.188 --> 33:13.101
I'm doing this because I don't Want
to say good-bye to everyone.

33:14.225 --> 33:17.069
Anybody who's ever left me
in my life just left --

33:17.161 --> 33:20.699
my dad going to get a pack of smokes
and never coming back,

33:20.999 --> 33:24.412
all those foster parents talking
about adopting me and never did.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.607
I don't want tonight's show to happen

33:26.704 --> 33:30.083
because I don't know
how to say good-bye, Liz Lemon.

33:30.174 --> 33:34.384
Now on stage,
feast your eyes on the Skank Train!

33:34.479 --> 33:35.787
Oh, boy. Okay.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.390
Look, Tray, it's not good-bye forever.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.053
I've enjoyed working with you,

33:40.151 --> 33:41.789
and I'm sure
we'll get to do it again sometime.

33:42.086 --> 33:43.622
And we're all gonna stay friends.

33:43.721 --> 33:44.791
I'm sorry, is that the white lady's way

33:45.089 --> 33:46.625
of saying
"I'm going out to get cigarettes"?

33:46.724 --> 33:48.567
'Cause that good-bye was atrocious.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.572
Fine! Well, I guess there's a reason
people don't say honest good-byes.

33:51.662 --> 33:53.039
Because when stuff is coming to an end,

33:53.131 --> 33:55.111
people freak out and they act crazy.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.338
They pick fights,
and they pick Blimpie's,

33:57.435 --> 33:59.244
and I don't know what Pete's doing!

33:59.337 --> 34:00.782
So you lie to them.

34:01.072 --> 34:03.211
But if you want
a hardcore truth good-bye...

34:03.307 --> 34:04.377
Lay it on me.

34:04.475 --> 34:07.081
Okay.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.317
We were forced to be friends
because of work.

34:09.414 --> 34:12.190
And we're probably not gonna
hang out after this.

34:12.283 --> 34:14.092
You'll say that you're gonna invite me
to your house,

34:14.185 --> 34:15.425
and it's never gonna happen.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.500
And I'll see on TV
that it's your birthday

34:17.588 --> 34:19.590
and I'll forget to call.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.498
Working with you was hard, Tracy.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.129
You frustrated me and you wore me out.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.672
But because the human heart

34:25.763 --> 34:28.505
is not properly connected
to the human brain,

34:28.599 --> 34:30.670
I love you and I'm gonna miss you.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.610
But tonight might be it.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.378
Brutally honest.

34:36.474 --> 34:37.714
I like that.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.350
So you'll come do the show?

34:41.446 --> 34:43.585
I'll come back, L.L.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.185
But we're gonna watch <i>this</i> first.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.661
Ride the train, ladies!

34:48.753 --> 34:49.857
L_lz;

34:50.154 --> 34:51.656
Ride the train.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.101
Kenneth, what are you doing?!

34:57.195 --> 35:00.108
Brian Williams needs a mirror
on the floor of his bathroom.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.474
I guess you want that
if you have a glass toilet.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.844
But the shows over after tonight,
so what do you care?

35:06.137 --> 35:09.118
But... my mirror.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.893
Oh, my God.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.892
It's all over.

35:24.255 --> 35:25.598
Am I crying?

35:27.391 --> 35:31.271
I have no way to see if I'm crying!

35:31.362 --> 35:33.638
Oh, thank God!

35:33.731 --> 35:35.369
Last lunch!

35:35.466 --> 35:36.137
No Lutz!

35:36.234 --> 35:37.508
Last lunch!

35:37.602 --> 35:38.672
No Lutz!

35:38.769 --> 35:40.771
Cupcake sandwich!

35:40.872 --> 35:43.148
Cupcake sandwich!

35:43.241 --> 35:46.313
Crap.
Motherhood has made me go soft.

35:46.410 --> 35:49.448
Lutz, the food is here.
Come eat --

35:53.651 --> 35:56.154
Oh, God!
Cover the food!

35:59.524 --> 36:00.696
Blimpie's!

36:02.360 --> 36:05.341
Cerie, you heard the man.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.669
Blimpie's.

36:10.568 --> 36:11.842
I was thinking
about what you said earlier,

36:11.936 --> 36:14.314
how people get sloppy
when they fake their own deaths.

36:14.405 --> 36:15.475
You said that.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.881
The trick is
to wait for the right moment --

36:17.175 --> 36:18.620
a day when it makes sense
to have a drink or two.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.280
I don't know, maybe a sad occasion

36:21.379 --> 36:22.915
when somethings coming to an end.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.887
You let people see you
with a glass in your hand.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.857
That way, after the crash,
they'll be like,

36:27.952 --> 36:29.260
"I did see him drinking."

36:29.353 --> 36:31.663
Oh, God, that idiot!
What did he do?!

36:31.756 --> 36:34.236
Yeah, that's what they'll say.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.369
Oh, no. No, no, no.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.513
Don't worry, Lemon.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.707
There is no cause for alarm.

36:46.804 --> 36:48.841
You are watching my video suicide note.

36:48.940 --> 36:49.941
Gasps 1 Oh, my God!

36:50.241 --> 36:51.811
Try not to blame yourself.

36:51.909 --> 36:54.287
How were you to know
that I was in such a dark place

36:54.378 --> 36:55.516
that the smallest thing --

36:55.613 --> 36:58.856
for example, a close friend's
refusal to reconcile --

36:58.950 --> 37:00.293
would be the final straw?

37:00.384 --> 37:01.658
He killed himself because of me!

37:01.752 --> 37:04.631
This is like what happened
with my gynecologist all over again!

37:04.722 --> 37:06.668
I do have a parting gift for you,
Lemon --

37:06.757 --> 37:08.361
His phone!
I can track his phone!

37:08.459 --> 37:09.904
Go to YouTube and search

37:09.994 --> 37:13.237
"Hamlet the mini pig goes down stairs."

37:13.331 --> 37:16.676
"Hamlet the mini pig" -- No!
Phone first!

37:16.767 --> 37:17.905
I'll watch the pig video in the cab.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.312
One minute.
One minute to air.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.908
Guys, to be honest, you are nerds,
and one of you is very funny.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.646
Good-bye forever.

37:29.714 --> 37:30.954
Good-bye, Petey Pete.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.455
I <i>Will</i> forget you.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.528
I sure hope so, Tray.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.596
I sure hope so.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.930
Tracy and Jenna, please set yourselves.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.910
Tracy...

37:52.003 --> 37:55.348
I'm really gonna miss you.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.783
My baloney, in all honesty...

37:58.876 --> 38:03.416
I'm going out for cigarettes now,
and I'll be home in 15 minutes.

38:05.716 --> 38:08.560
Tracy and Jenna, please
set yourselves for "The Hitlersons".

38:08.653 --> 38:10.599
My good side for camer-ah.

38:18.529 --> 38:19.769
Jack! Wait!

38:19.864 --> 38:21.434
There's so much to live for!

38:21.532 --> 38:23.944
Don't you want to know
how "Mad Men" ends?!

38:25.536 --> 38:28.016
Or Don goes to work for Peggy!

38:31.709 --> 38:32.551
Hello, Lemon.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.782
What?! I thought you were gonna
kill yourself!

38:34.879 --> 38:38.019
That was the idea.
It was extreme but necessary.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.956
I didn't want to be just another person
on your grudge list.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.032
Which reminds me --
why am I still seeing new "Top Chefs"

38:43.321 --> 38:44.629
with that bald salad-ruiner?!

38:44.722 --> 38:48.499
I had 10 hours to force you
to confront the soul-crushing horror

38:48.592 --> 38:49.764
of a life without me.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.431
I didn't lie
when I said I was going away.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.840
I'm off to discover what makes me happy.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.605
I have to find my bliss --

38:56.701 --> 39:00.706
which, for once, is not an acronym
for "Beautiful Ladies In Short Shorts."

39:00.805 --> 39:02.876
How long will you be gone?

39:02.973 --> 39:04.884
As long as it takes
to figure out what's next.

39:04.975 --> 39:06.784
Although I've only been on this boat
a minute,

39:06.877 --> 39:09.357
I've already realized
two things about myself.

39:09.447 --> 39:12.792
One -- I could totally be
a professional boat model.

39:12.883 --> 39:14.692
And two -- I do know one thing

39:14.785 --> 39:17.391
that has made me happy
these last seven years.

39:17.488 --> 39:21.561
Lemon, there is a word,
a once-special word

39:21.659 --> 39:24.833
that's been tragically co-opted
by the romance-industrial complex.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.671
And I would hate to use it here
and have you think

39:27.765 --> 39:30.143
that I am suggesting
any kind of romantic sentiment,

39:30.434 --> 39:33.438
let alone an invitation
to scale bone mountain.

39:33.537 --> 39:38.486
It's a word that comes to us
by way of the old high German "luba"

39:38.576 --> 39:42.490
from the Latin "lubere,"
meaning "to be pleasing."

39:42.580 --> 39:46.756
So I am going to use this word
to describe how I feel about you

39:46.851 --> 39:50.060
in the way that our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers would have used it

39:50.154 --> 39:54.796
in reference to, say, uh,
a hot bowl of bear meat

39:54.892 --> 39:58.101
or your enemy's skull... split.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.602
I love you, too, Jack.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.146
Thank you, America!
That's our show.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.778
Not a lot of people watched it,

40:05.870 --> 40:08.851
but the joke's on you,
'cause we got paid anyway.

40:08.939 --> 40:11.647
Ladies and gentlemen, Jenna Maroney.

40:17.081 --> 40:20.187
# The Irma Luhrmer-Merman murder #

40:20.484 --> 40:21.963
# Turned the bird's word lurid #

40:22.052 --> 40:24.430
# The whir and the purr
of a twirler girl #

40:24.522 --> 40:26.832
# She would the world were demurer #

40:26.924 --> 40:31.930
# The insurer's allure for valor
were pure Kari Wuhrer #

40:32.029 --> 40:35.203
# One fervid whirl
over her turgid error #

40:35.499 --> 40:37.775
# Rural juror #

40:37.868 --> 40:39.905
# Rural juror #

40:40.004 --> 40:44.646
# I will never forget you, rural juror #

40:44.742 --> 40:49.657
# I'll always be glad I met you,
rural juror #

40:49.747 --> 40:52.057
This is just the start, Lemon.

40:52.149 --> 40:57.929
Imagine the insights
months on this boat will yield.

40:59.223 --> 41:02.830
The next time you see me,
I'll be a new man.

41:06.096 --> 41:08.736
Good-bye, Jack Donaghy.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.579
Good God, Lemon,
I just figured it all out!

41:18.676 --> 41:21.680
I'm turning around!
Clear dishwashers!

41:21.779 --> 41:23.656
- What?!
- Clear dishwashers!

41:23.747 --> 41:26.250
So you can see what's going on inside it!

41:26.550 --> 41:29.531
Oh, my God, yes!
Do that!

41:29.620 --> 41:31.998
It's the best idea I've ever had!

41:32.089 --> 41:34.228
Thank God I took that boat trip.

41:34.525 --> 41:39.099
# I will never forget you, rural juror #

41:39.196 --> 41:44.236
# I'll always be glad I met you,
rural juror #

41:44.535 --> 41:49.280
# I will never forget you, rural juror #

41:49.573 --> 41:55.080
# I'll always be glad I met you,
rural juror #

41:55.179 --> 42:02.188
# These were the best days of my... #

42:02.286 --> 42:05.130
# fluuuurm #

42:17.034 --> 42:18.240
- Get in the car, Pete.
- Paula!

42:18.536 --> 42:20.243
I mean, who's Pete?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.812
I have amnesia!

42:21.906 --> 42:24.079
Oh, damn it, I practiced this!

42:26.710 --> 42:28.246
Hi, buddies.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.957
Wait, you're Sam?

42:31.582 --> 42:33.858
Don't. Even. Say it.

42:35.586 --> 42:37.793
I want to thank
the brilliant Kevin Grisham,

42:37.888 --> 42:39.765
the amazing John Stamos,

42:39.857 --> 42:42.337
the incomparable Judge Judy Sheindlin --

42:42.626 --> 42:44.902
Hey, what are you doing?!
They called my name!

42:44.995 --> 42:46.303
See you later, suckers!

42:46.597 --> 42:48.668
Meep-meep! Peowwww!

42:52.736 --> 42:54.340
She'll be like, "What?"

43:04.949 --> 43:06.622
Hey, Lemon ice, can I call you back?

43:06.717 --> 43:09.926
My dad finally came back
from getting cigarettes!

43:12.823 --> 43:15.997
Lemon, it's Jack.
Don't forget Tracy's birthday.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.163
Good morning, Mr. Donaghy.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.241
I'm your new second assistant.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.606
Wait, you're Sam?!

43:21.699 --> 43:23.235
Mm-hmm.

43:31.976 --> 43:35.981
So, the whole show just takes place
here at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.218
Is that right, Miss Lemon?

43:37.314 --> 43:40.056
Yes, sir. It's based on stories
my great-grandmother told me.

43:40.150 --> 43:42.027
I know.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.827
And I love it.

43:45.305 --> 43:51.897
