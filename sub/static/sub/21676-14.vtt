WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:14.999
- Batten down the hatches.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
The crew from
"Below Deck" is reunited.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
If things get heated,
not allowed to dive overboard.

00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
You're not serving me
resting bitch face today.

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
- It's early.
- [laughs]

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
- Who sent the first text?

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
- That was probably me
that sent the first text.

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
But things happened
before that.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
- Is this the first time
you've shared a room

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
with a gay crew member?

00:31.999 --> 00:32.999
- Homosexual.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- Worst thing about life
on a yacht?

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
- Being stuck with the crew.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.999
You're not the easiest person
to get along with.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.000
- This isn't about getting
along--this is a job.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
- Were you hoping to rekindle
things with Ben?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
- You have some cocktails.
You make bad decisions.

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
That's all it ever was.

00:46.999 --> 00:49.999
- Leon could have been a little
more passionate about his job.

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
- He's a great guy.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
- I'm calling bullsháá
on that.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- I really did think we were
friends, so that was a shocker.

00:54.999 --> 00:55.999
- I'm not saying
we're not friends.

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
You can have friends
that are annoying.

00:57.999 --> 01:00.999
- There was a mug with wine in
it that Kate had been drinking.

01:00.999 --> 01:04.999
- So wait. You're accusing Kate
of drinking on charter?

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
Emile, do you think Rocky
kind of led you on?

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
- Yes.
- You didn't have to--

01:07.999 --> 01:08.999
- So I didn't work at all?
- No, you're done.

01:08.999 --> 01:09.999
You've been talking a lot.
- Hold on.

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
You're not my chief stew
right now, baby.

01:11.999 --> 01:13.999
- But I didn't, like,
have any kind

01:13.999 --> 01:14.999
of sexual interaction
with her anymore.

01:14.999 --> 01:16.999
- What about two times
after the show?

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
- Ooh!
[laughter]

01:18.999 --> 01:20.999
- Are you denying that?

01:20.999 --> 01:22.999
- Anybody knows that your ass
would have been on a boat

01:22.999 --> 01:23.999
and out of there
in a heartbeat.

01:23.999 --> 01:26.999
- Are you gonna hold on to this
for the rest of your life?

01:26.999 --> 01:30.999
[dramatic music]

01:32.999 --> 01:33.999
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:33.999 --> 01:36.999
- Look at you.

01:36.999 --> 01:37.999
- Who's Captain Lee?

01:41.999 --> 01:44.999
- They are the best known,
best-looking yachties

01:44.999 --> 01:49.999
on all the high seas,
the crew of motor yacht "Eros."

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
Captain Lee, great to see you.

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
- Good to see you, Andy.

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
- I feel like you've called
us all to the bridge.

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
- You think?
- A little bit.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
Emile, you're in a suit.

01:59.999 --> 02:00.999
Is that your suit, Emile?

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
- It's actually
my grandpa's suit.

02:02.999 --> 02:03.999
- It's your grandpa's suit?

02:03.999 --> 02:04.999
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.999
- You're over-indexing
on the adorable scale. Kate?

02:07.999 --> 02:09.999
- Hi.
- You look great.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.999
You're not serving
me resting bitch face today.

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
- It's early.
- It's early.

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
- Yeah.
- Connie.

02:14.999 --> 02:17.000
I almost didn't recognize you
with your top on.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.999
- Well, I can--No.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
- You love to have
the girls out, don't you?

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
- It's just comforting.
I think I'm just claustrophobic.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.000
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi, there.

02:24.999 --> 02:25.999
- Your hair's
pretty high today.

02:25.999 --> 02:26.999
- Thank you.
- I like it.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
- I kind of had a hair moment
for a minute, but...

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
- Okay.
- I'm glad it went up.

02:30.999 --> 02:31.999
- Rocky, great to see you.

02:31.999 --> 02:33.999
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- You look fantastic.

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
- Thank you.
You also.

02:35.999 --> 02:38.999
- If things get heated,
not allowed to dive overboard.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.000
- Well, there's no water.
- Right.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.999
Good point.
- [laughs]

02:41.999 --> 02:44.999
- Eddie, I'm so happy that
you got the mint-green memo.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
- Great minds think alike,
you know?

02:46.999 --> 02:49.999
- You guys
had an intense charter season,

02:49.999 --> 02:50.999
to say the least.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.999
You had fires in the galley,

02:52.999 --> 02:55.000
secret hookups
in the laundry room,

02:55.999 --> 02:58.999
and crew members
literally jumping ship

02:58.999 --> 03:00.999
during charters.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.999
The viewers and I have a lot
of questions for you,

03:03.999 --> 03:06.999
so I want to ask, what are
the best and worst things

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
about life on a yacht?

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
- Traveling, destinations.

03:09.999 --> 03:10.999
- Traveling.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
Worst thing about life
on a yacht?

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
- Being stuck with the crew.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
- There you go.
- Constipation.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
- What?
- Constipation.

03:17.999 --> 03:18.999
- Constipation?
- Yeah.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
- Are you constipated
on the boat?

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
- It's a definite problem.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.999
- Would you guys
agree with that, or--

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
- Why don't you tell him about
kicking your girl roommate out

03:25.999 --> 03:27.000
so you could jerk off
every morning?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
- Excuse me, Connie?

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
- He asked me to get on deck a
few minutes early every morning

03:31.999 --> 03:35.000
because he said he was young and
needs to handle his business.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Is that the same business
as the constipation?

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
- No.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
There's constipation
in the front

03:40.999 --> 03:42.000
and constipation in the back.

03:42.999 --> 03:43.999
- Exactly, and it's got
to be handled.

03:43.999 --> 03:48.999
- The next time little Rocky
decides to get your attention,

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
I don't know
what you got to do.

03:55.999 --> 03:56.999
- It's called wanking.

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
- Were you wanking in that shot?
- Yeah.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
Every guy has to wank.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
Why lie about it?
I mean, everybody does it.

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
Why hide it?

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
- Kate, who was your favorite
charter this season?

04:06.999 --> 04:10.999
- I loved Punkass TapouT.

04:11.999 --> 04:13.000
- Punkass Caldwell.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
- Dan is not my typical type

04:15.999 --> 04:18.999
but those tattoos, those eyes.

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
There's, like, a quiet strength
about him.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
He's just so handsome
but tough but sweet.

04:22.999 --> 04:26.999
Oh.
He's cute.

04:26.999 --> 04:27.999
God, he was so gorgeous,

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
but he was also sweet
and kind and powerful,

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
and he's just amazing.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
- In my opinion,
the best charter guest

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
was Steve,
the "More foam, bosun" guy?

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
- Ohh!
- So much fun!

04:36.999 --> 04:39.999
- Oh, stop!
- Hey!

04:39.999 --> 04:41.999
More foam, bosun!
- Get in on it!

04:41.999 --> 04:45.999
- More foam, bosun!
[both screaming]

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
- Eddie, it seemed
like Steve and Jennifer

04:47.999 --> 04:51.999
were giving you some extra
attention during their charter.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.999
- Want this in your room?

04:56.999 --> 04:57.999
Sleep well.
- Come on!

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
- Oh, here.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
I can't blame them for trying,

05:02.999 --> 05:05.999
but I really don't want to be
a part of their ménage à trois.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
Tres.
Whatever they say in Spanish.

05:07.999 --> 05:08.999
She really wanted
me to come inside and--

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
- "Ooh, Eddie, come inside.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.999
Come inside.
Bring it inside and by the bed."

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
- Yeah, yeah.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
- More foam, bosun.
- More foam, bosun.

05:15.999 --> 05:20.999
- I want to ask, how hard
is it doing your actual jobs

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
when there are camera crews

05:22.999 --> 05:26.999
and sound guys and lighting?

05:26.999 --> 05:28.000
- Ah!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.999
Aah! Aah!

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
- Just keep--

05:32.999 --> 05:35.999
[smoke alarm beeping]

05:35.999 --> 05:38.999
- Shooting super tight.
Aah!

05:38.999 --> 05:40.999
- Stop talking!

05:40.999 --> 05:43.999
- Sorry, guys.
I'm gonna move this.

05:43.999 --> 05:44.999
- I love it.

05:44.999 --> 05:45.999
It makes it more interesting.

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
I've been doing yachting
for so long,

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
this added a new dimension
to it.

05:48.999 --> 05:51.999
Something already know how to
do, it made it exciting again.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
- I have to think,
for the deck crew,

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
does it get in the way of you
guys the most?

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
- I think so, 'cause, I mean,
there's a lot of times where,

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
you know, the guests
want to go off the boat.

05:58.999 --> 05:59.999
They want to go
do something onshore,

05:59.999 --> 06:01.999
something like that,

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
and, you know, usually
you can be like,

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
"Okay, let's jump in the tender,
and let's go."

06:04.999 --> 06:08.999
But when there's
audio and camera and gaffers--

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
- It's like doing your job
but five times over.

06:10.999 --> 06:11.999
So you do it, like--

06:11.999 --> 06:12.999
- We're literally
doing two jobs,

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
two full-time jobs at once.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.999
- Rocky, there's one question
that everyone on social media

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
wants answered.

06:18.999 --> 06:21.999
During your interviews,
who are you looking at?

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
- Eddie's so hot.

06:25.999 --> 06:26.999
If he didn't have
a girlfriend...

06:26.999 --> 06:28.000
[whistles]

06:28.999 --> 06:29.999
Yep, I said that.
[clicks tongue]

06:29.999 --> 06:32.999
It's hard to, like, push through
and be your awesome self

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
when everyone's telling you,

06:34.999 --> 06:37.999
like, "You suck,"
or "Your dishes suck."

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
Uh-uh.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
I think they put little
butterflies in the corner,

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
and they kept just,
like, sparkling at me.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- Really?
- Or dolphins, I don't know.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Sparkly butterflies
and dolphins.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
- Sparkly butterflies.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
When I think, I look up,
and that's just what it is.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
- Oh, so that's what it is.
When you think, you look up.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
- Yeah, it's like I'm thinking.
I don't know.

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
Yeah. I'm just thinking.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
- All right, see if there's
butterflies up there.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
- Hi, Eddie, how you doing?
- Oh, good, how you doing?

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
- What's up?
- Oh, just chilling.

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
- You want to get
into some stuff?

07:02.999 --> 07:03.999
- No, I was just saying.
Did you--

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, sure.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
I was just saying, did you--

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
- Is your girlfriend here?
Can I meet her?

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
I have a lot to share.
- [chuckles awkwardly]

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
Never mind.
- That shut you up.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- The main duty of the stews

07:14.999 --> 07:17.999
is to cater
to the guests' every whim.

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
Kate, Amy, and Rocky,

07:18.999 --> 07:22.999
you ladies did a great job
keeping the guests happy,

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
despite the fact, at times,

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
that you were
at each other's throats.

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
- You know what you're
really good at, Kate?

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
Sharp little jabs.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
You're a jabber.
You just jab, jab, jab.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
- You know
what you're really good at?

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
- Tell me.
- Showing no respect.

07:35.999 --> 07:36.999
- I know you guys think

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
that I'm not doing my job,
but I am doing my job.

07:38.999 --> 07:40.999
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
putting words in my mouth.

07:40.999 --> 07:41.999
- I'm sorry, I'm getting
frustrated, and it's like--

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
- Well, I'm frustrated too,
so you're right.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.999
- Amy, what do you think of Kate
as a manager?

07:46.999 --> 07:47.999
- Yeah, I think Kate

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
has, like, a no-nonsense
type of management.

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
She's got a job ahead of her.
She wants to get it done,

07:52.999 --> 07:55.999
and the thing is,
with charters, there's no time.

07:55.999 --> 07:56.999
There's no extra time.

07:56.999 --> 08:00.999
- I think there are different
ways you can lead people,

08:00.999 --> 08:03.000
and I don't think
you have to be...

08:03.999 --> 08:05.999
rude or a bitch
to get the point across,

08:05.999 --> 08:08.999
and she just didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

08:08.999 --> 08:11.999
And it was, like, that's it.

08:11.999 --> 08:15.999
Raquel's off, and it
was really, really hard.

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- That's not what I would call
an accurate portrait

08:18.999 --> 08:20.999
of the situation that I saw.

08:20.999 --> 08:24.999
I saw Amy spend
a lot of time with you,

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
showing you what to do,

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
exactly how to do it,

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
and you going, "It is so much.
It is too much work.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
It is so much this
and so much that."

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
And you just didn't want
to hear it anymore.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
- You want to pay attention
to this corner.

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
Like, see, you don't want
to see it folded back up.

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
And then this needs to be--
Like, tucks in there.

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
So you kind of just give it
a fluff and a chop.

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
And then
you want to hold this.

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
- Listen, I need
a minute right now,

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
'cause this is, like...

08:48.999 --> 08:51.999
I'm just breathing again.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
- You didn't pull
it together,

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
and you didn't set
your personal feelings aside

08:55.999 --> 08:58.999
and just plow through it,
and that's what I expected.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.999
And that's what I expect
out of everybody.

09:00.999 --> 09:01.999
- Okay.
- Period.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
- Well, I hear that.
- But it didn't happen.

09:03.999 --> 09:04.999
- Why is it any different

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
hearing it
from Captain Lee than me?

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
'Cause I am technically
also your boss.

09:07.999 --> 09:08.999
- I just think it's funny
that you guys think

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
I didn't work at all
this season.

09:10.999 --> 09:11.999
I worked my ass off.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
- You did a fair amount

09:12.999 --> 09:15.999
of complaining
while you were doing it all.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
- Yeah.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
- First of all, you said you
had stewardess experience,

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
which I could tell
that you did not.

09:21.999 --> 09:24.999
And so I took you around,
and you said, "I don't want to--

09:24.999 --> 09:27.999
I don't want you to show me.
Give me a list."

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
And I think everyone remembers,

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
I said, "You're not ready
for the list."

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
- Okay.
- Okay, so don't tell me

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
that I never tried showing you,
'cause I did.

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
- What do you want
to hear, Kate?

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Do you want to hear, Kate,

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
"Okay, Kate,
I didn't do my job"?

09:38.999 --> 09:41.999
You guys all want to hear
I didn't partake?

09:41.999 --> 09:42.999
- No, I just would like

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
to have you not slander
my professional reputation

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
and my character because
I asked you to do your job.

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
- Kate, you are the queen.

09:50.999 --> 09:51.999
You are the best.

09:51.999 --> 09:52.999
Thank you.

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
- Do you really need to love

09:54.999 --> 09:57.999
laundry the way
that Kate says, Amy?

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
- Yes, you spend a lot of time
in the laundry room.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
So it's a good thing.

10:01.999 --> 10:02.999
- It's a good thing to love--

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
- It's nice.
You get peace and quiet.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
It's one of the, you know,
places that you can get away.

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
- Well, we all know laundry
rooms are great for sex.

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
- Apparently.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
- But we'll get
into that in a little bit.

10:12.999 --> 10:13.999
- Got to be better
than the bunks.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- Eddie, Connie succeeded
as a newbie,

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
while Rocky struggled.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
Did that have anything to do

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
with the fact that Connie
had you as a teacher

10:20.999 --> 10:21.999
and Rocky had Kate?

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
- I don't know.
You know, I mean,

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
Kate and I definitely have
different leadership styles,

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
and I guess just the way

10:27.999 --> 10:30.999
that Connie and I worked
together definitely jived.

10:30.999 --> 10:33.999
You know, I can't really
put two cents into how Kate

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
and Rocky worked together
'cause I didn't work with them.

10:35.999 --> 10:37.000
- I think I lead by example.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.999
I never spoke to you
in any of those ways,

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
although I was tempted.

10:41.999 --> 10:42.999
- Kate, the way you're talking
to me right now...

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
- [sighs]
- It's like--

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
it's really hard, like--

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
- I know.
It's hard for you.

10:48.999 --> 10:51.999
- You're not the easiest person
to get along with.

10:51.999 --> 10:52.999
Let's get that out there.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- This isn't about getting
along--this is a job.

10:54.999 --> 10:55.999
- I think the hard part
is, like,

10:55.999 --> 10:56.999
Rocky's so capable of the job,

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
but you just didn't want to.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
It was like, "How can we
motivate her to do the job?

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
'Cause we need the third stew."
That was the hard part.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
- Well, I think it's interesting
that the two of you,

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
Amy and Kate, fought like
cats and dogs last season,

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
and this season you got along.

11:09.999 --> 11:12.999
Rocky, were you disappointed
that you didn't get more support

11:12.999 --> 11:17.999
from Amy in the whole
Kate training moment?

11:17.999 --> 11:20.000
- Well, I thought Amy
was actually a--

11:20.999 --> 11:21.999
She was a good friend,

11:21.999 --> 11:25.999
and she was a really awesome
person to teach me how to do--

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
become a professional stew.

11:27.999 --> 11:31.999
But then, you know,
I felt like--

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
'cause she would confide in me
and be like, "Yeah, I know.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.999
"Kate's a total bitch.
Don't worry about it."

11:35.999 --> 11:36.999
And, "I get it, I get it."

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
But then she would be,
you know, "Hey, Kate."

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
And it's like, you know,

11:41.999 --> 11:44.999
why not just be real?

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
- See, I think
that's completely ridiculous.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
- I'm sorry. I'm losing it.
- Don't apologize.

11:48.999 --> 11:49.999
- I know what
you're going through.

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
I sympathize for Rocky.

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
I've worked with Kate before

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
where we have been
on opposing ends.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.999
Here's the thing--I enjoyed
sharing a room with you.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
The things that I love
about you and your spirit

11:58.999 --> 12:01.999
are also the hard things
to work with you.

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
You're a spitfire.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
You're fun.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
You're energetic.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
That's so great.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
But sometimes that's hard
to work with.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
- Rocky, you called Kate
a bully on Twitter.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
Did you feel bullied by her
during this season?

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
- Absolutely.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.999
She is so good

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
at hurting people's feelings,
it's amazing.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
She should get medals.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
Medals.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
- Kate, you are very active
on social media.

12:25.999 --> 12:26.999
- I am.
I really enjoy it.

12:26.999 --> 12:30.999
- Why do you dig so hard?
Why do you go so deep and dark?

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
- What's the deepest
and darkest that I've gone?

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
Because--

12:34.999 --> 12:35.999
- You've done so many things,
and the--

12:35.999 --> 12:38.999
- Tell me. I will stand
behind whatever I've tweeted.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
- Okay, well,
I have some tweets...

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
- Ready.
- That you've sent.

12:41.999 --> 12:45.999
"Rocky thinks her job is being
sexual with every male on board.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.999
There's a name for that job,
and it's not stewardess."

12:48.999 --> 12:50.999
- Yeah.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
- "I was so surprised when
I found Rocky's mermaid tail."

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
"She just doesn't seem
like a girl

12:55.999 --> 12:58.999
that enjoys keeping her legs
together."

12:58.999 --> 13:02.999
Did any of those tweets
that I just read irritate you?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
The--
- Yeah, it's just funny, yeah.

13:04.999 --> 13:05.999
- Okay.
Well, anyways...

13:05.999 --> 13:10.999
I am so sorry if my menial
Twitter following offended you.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.999
- You're just evil.
You are just straight up evil.

13:17.999 --> 13:18.999
- Coming up...

13:18.999 --> 13:20.999
- I wasn't into my boss.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
Eddie's an assáááá.
I'm over this ship.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- Why is she getting to talk?
Nobody wants to hear it.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.999
I mean, it's all bullsháá.
It's annoying as hell.

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
- Hold on. You're not
my chief stew right now, baby.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.999
but two deckhands mid-charter

13:40.999 --> 13:42.000
at the same time
you were training

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
a brand-new deckie, Connie.

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.999
- And you were trying
to fix your relationship

13:46.999 --> 13:48.000
with your girlfriend.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.000
- [chuckles]

13:58.999 --> 14:01.000
- Do you think
you let your personal problems

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
at home distract
you at all from the--

14:03.999 --> 14:04.999
- Yes.
- From doing your job?

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
- Yeah, absolutely.
I definitely think so.

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
I think you can't let your--

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
you know, your personal issues
get involved with work.

14:10.999 --> 14:12.999
And I definitely
failed in that aspect

14:12.999 --> 14:16.999
of letting my problems back home
and my personal problems

14:16.999 --> 14:19.999
during charter affect
my work ethic this season.

14:19.999 --> 14:22.999
- On a scale of one to ten,
how was your job performance?

14:22.999 --> 14:25.999
- Overall, I don't know.
Seven.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
- Captain Lee?
- Yeah, I would say a seven.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.999
- Okay. Could you tell
from the beginning of the season

14:31.999 --> 14:34.999
that Eddie
was struggling personally?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.999
- Not from the very beginning,

14:36.999 --> 14:39.999
but it became apparent
that it wasn't the same Eddie

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
that I'd had before.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
- Connie, this was your first
time as a deckhand on a yacht.

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
- Yes.
- Is Eddie a good teacher?

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
- Eddie was
a fantastic teacher.

14:47.999 --> 14:50.999
He never made me feel
like an idiot, ever.

14:50.999 --> 14:53.999
- You really want to make sure
that nothing is going to catch.

14:53.999 --> 14:54.999
- Now.
- Dropping.

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
- Anchor's on the bottom.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
I'm proud of myself right now.

15:02.999 --> 15:03.999
I'm gonna lock it up.
- All right.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
- You're my lead deckhand.
- Yeah, right.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
Locked.
- You are.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
You're the only one I trust.

15:08.999 --> 15:12.999
- Eddie, what was
your first impression of Emile?

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
- This boy's pretty.

15:13.999 --> 15:16.999
- It's tough being pretty,
ain't it?

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
- Oh, man.

15:17.999 --> 15:18.999
- Is it hard to be pretty,
Emile?

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- It is, actually,
because a lot of times

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
when a captain hires you,
you're called pretty boy.

15:23.999 --> 15:24.999
- Oh, I never
called you pretty boy.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
- No, no, not Captain Lee.
- Right.

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
- But, I mean, I've had captains
that actually--

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
because of the way I look,

15:30.999 --> 15:31.999
I've been told that,

15:31.999 --> 15:33.999
"You can't work hard.
You don't know that."

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
So you work against that.

15:34.999 --> 15:38.999
If I was ugly or whatever,
I didn't look like this,

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
maybe I would have been
treated differently.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
- Do you sometimes wish
you were ugly, Emile?

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
- Yeah, I do sometimes.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

15:45.999 --> 15:46.999
- Maybe, maybe.
I don't know.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
- I mean, we could hit him
in the face or something.

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
- Are you gonna be able to fit
out of the door

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
out of here
with your head just so big?

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- You're very handsome,
and you're a very hard worker.

15:54.999 --> 15:55.999
Just say how you are.

15:55.999 --> 15:58.999
- It's, like, haters gonna hate,
taters gonna tate,

15:58.999 --> 15:59.999
gators gonna gate.

15:59.999 --> 16:02.999
- Emile, did you get proper
credit for your deckhand skills?

16:02.999 --> 16:04.999
- I probably took the job
too serious,

16:04.999 --> 16:08.999
because if your crew
can't do the required job,

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
it's putting the rest
of the crew in danger.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
So I might have put
in extra hours

16:13.999 --> 16:16.999
because you'd rather
do it yourself than explain it.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.999
And then when you put
in extra hours,

16:18.999 --> 16:21.999
you are a little bit more
off of your game.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.000
- Are you saying Connie
couldn't do the job?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.999
- No, no, no, no.

16:24.999 --> 16:27.999
- You got so frustrated
that you called Connie a whore.

16:27.999 --> 16:28.999
- You talk way too much.

16:28.999 --> 16:31.999
- I completely understand
why Rocky gave up on you,

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
'cause you really are
a little bitch.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
- Jesus Christ.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
Give me sháá?
I know what the fááá I'm doing.

16:36.999 --> 16:39.999
So why don't you
do your fáááing job, you whore?

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
- Go fááá yourself.
I'm done.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.000
- I can't justify that.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
I don't even try
to justify that. That's wrong.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
- We did get along great,
but we also had--

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
We were put in a lot
of frustrating positions.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
We're both two siblings.
I have a brother.

16:58.999 --> 16:59.999
He has a sister.
- Yes.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.000
So we try to get each other--
- It was like we were--

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
- We try to get each other to
go, like--You know what I mean?

17:03.999 --> 17:06.000
This is, like,
very just, like, lighthearted.

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
It's nothing that's serious.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
- We got really good
at pushing each other's buttons.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
- Yes.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.999
- But inside,
I know we were both smirking.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
- Emile, is yachting a way
for you to kind of

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
run away from home
in a weird way?

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
- Well, South Africa
is dangerous.

17:18.999 --> 17:22.000
It's a third-world country with
socioeconomic problems, okay?

17:22.999 --> 17:24.999
You have really nice houses,

17:24.999 --> 17:25.999
and then you've got people
that are, like,

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
fighting for a piece of bread.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
That's why you get so many

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
South Africans that want to do
something for themselves.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
You know, there's something
else out there.

17:32.999 --> 17:33.999
We don't want to fight.

17:33.999 --> 17:36.999
We just want to roll our own
and survive.

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
- Captain Lee, what did you
think of Emile as a deckhand?

17:39.999 --> 17:40.999
- I thought he was great.

17:40.999 --> 17:44.999
He always kept his focus,

17:44.999 --> 17:46.999
and he was always
trying to do his job.

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
Even when he, you know,

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
had some errors
that he committed,

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
you know, he didn't
give up on it.

17:51.999 --> 17:55.999
- Do you regret following Rocky
up to the radar mast?

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
- Did he say crew on the mast?
- God damn it.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
- Do something gangster.
Be like--

18:01.999 --> 18:03.999
- All right, you guys
need to come down off of there.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
- We're in trouble.

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
- I should have not.

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
I should have kept my eye
on the ball,

18:07.999 --> 18:11.999
not been distracted
by a female co-worker.

18:11.999 --> 18:15.999
She's a very pleasant
distraction.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
She's got a very nice,
mysterious ass.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
[laughter]

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
Rocky, you've got an asset.

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- I've got one asset.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
- Rocky, when you did get
a chance to cook the crew meal,

18:25.999 --> 18:28.999
Eddie was very miffed that you
served undercooked chicken.

18:30.999 --> 18:34.999
- Does that look raw to you?

18:34.999 --> 18:36.999
- The chicken
should be cooked--

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
- Fááá.

18:40.999 --> 18:41.999
- That was a valid concern?
- Yeah.

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
I guess I did,
and you know what?

18:43.999 --> 18:44.999
Things happen.

18:44.999 --> 18:48.999
- Besides the possible
salmonella,

18:48.999 --> 18:50.999
how was that crew meal?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
- Chicken sushi?

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
- I had a salad.
You made a bomb--

18:53.999 --> 18:54.999
It was a good salad.

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
- Connie,
how did you like that lunch?

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
- The parts that were cooked
were healthy and good.

18:59.999 --> 19:02.999
- It was good. Yeah, yeah,
what I had was--I liked it.

19:02.999 --> 19:05.999
- Rocky, what is your specialty
in the kitchen?

19:05.999 --> 19:09.999
- Killing people.
[laughter]

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
- Cynthia from Toms River,
New Jersey, said,

19:11.999 --> 19:14.999
"Unlike Rocky,
I'm an actual chef,

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
"and I can promise you
that no culinary school

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
would ever teach anyone
to pour grenadine on oysters."

19:19.999 --> 19:20.999
- Boom, little oysters.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
Ooh, I have a great idea.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.000
I've got my ideas.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
Mmm, it's gonna taste amazing.
They're gonna love it.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
- What's in there?
- Grenadine.

19:27.999 --> 19:29.999
It's a little strange.

19:29.999 --> 19:30.999
- I didn't pour it on.

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
I was doing a little dot
just for color,

19:33.999 --> 19:34.999
but you know what?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.999
I don't really care
what anyone thinks

19:36.999 --> 19:40.999
because I know
what I'm capable of.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
- But that's the kind
of attitude, like,

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
when we were trying to show
you something, and you're like,

19:43.999 --> 19:44.999
"I don't care what y'all think,"
or "I don't care what you say.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
I know what I'm gonna
be able to do."

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
- I had to whip up a dinner
in 45 minutes,

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
and I think I did a great job.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
The guests absolutely loved it.

19:53.999 --> 19:56.999
- Just put a little bit
of lemon on hre.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
- You can eat that,
whatever that is.

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
- So...

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
- Emile, do you think
that Rocky

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
would be a better chef
or a stew?

20:05.999 --> 20:06.999
- If she really listened

20:06.999 --> 20:09.999
and took advice
from other people around her,

20:09.999 --> 20:10.999
just trust them.

20:10.999 --> 20:11.999
- Thank you.

20:11.999 --> 20:13.999
- Because no one
really wants to demean you.

20:13.999 --> 20:16.999
No one wants you
to make you look bad.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
- Well said.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
Amazing.
- It's true, we did.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
We wanted you to do well,
and when you gave us attitude,

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
it's kind of like,
"But we're here for you.

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
"We want you to succeed.

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
"We want you to stay a part
of the crew.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
We want to teach
you these things,"

20:27.999 --> 20:28.999
and that was a hard part,
you know?

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
- I learned a brand-new job.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
I wasn't into my boss.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
Eddie's an assáááá.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
My best friend, Leon, leaves?

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
I'm over this ship.
- All right.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
- Why is she getting
to talk so much?

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
- Well, I'm happy for you--

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
- Why? Nobody wants to hear it.
- Oh, my God.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
- I mean, it's all bullsháá.
It's annoying as hell.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
She didn't work
the whole season.

20:49.999 --> 20:50.999
We gave you money.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.999
I earned you money,
and you didn't even have to--

20:53.999 --> 20:54.999
- So I didn't work at all--
- No, you're done.

20:54.999 --> 20:55.999
You've been talking a lot.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- I didn't work at all?
- You need to take it--

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
- Hold on, you're not my chief
stew right now, baby.

21:00.999 --> 21:01.999
- Coming up...

21:01.999 --> 21:04.999
- We would be given
specific instructions,

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
but, "No, no, no,
I'm gonna do it my way."

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
And it's like, "No, they tell
you what to do, you do it."

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
Whether you agree
with it or not,

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
they're in that position
for a reason.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- She didn't work
the whole season.

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
- So I didn't work at all.
- No, you're done.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
You've been talking a lot.

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
- Hold on, you're not
my chief stew right now, baby.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- It didn't matter when I was.
- You're not my chief stew.

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
- It didn't matter when I was.
- Hold on.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
- You didn't want to do
what I asked you then either.

21:28.999 --> 21:29.999
- Okay, what do you want to say?

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
- Keep talking, Rocky.
- What do you want to say?

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
- Let's just keep talking.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
- No, I want to know
what you want to say.

21:33.999 --> 21:36.999
- I want to say that it
was not about a personal attack.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
We were all there to do a job,

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
and we pulled your weight
for a long time.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.999
- Okay.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.999
- And you made equal parts
money.

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
- I didn't do any--

21:45.999 --> 21:49.999
so I didn't do any work,
and I didn't deserve my tip?

21:49.999 --> 21:50.999
- No.
- Okay.

21:50.999 --> 21:53.999
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you for your opinion.

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
- And so now I prefer,

21:54.999 --> 21:57.999
since we already
pulled your weight then,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.999
if you didn't just keep talking
and using all of our time.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.000
- You claim
you hate being a stew,

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
but aren't you now working
as a stew on a charter boat...

22:04.999 --> 22:05.999
- Yeah.
I--

22:05.999 --> 22:08.999
- That is captained by Alex
from season one?

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
- I do work for Captain Alex.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.999
He has, like, ten yachts
that he's in charge of,

22:12.999 --> 22:13.999
and I do charters with him.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.999
- Are you a stew on those?
- Yeah.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
I'm stewing right now,

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
and sometimes I cook for the
family, and I'm really happy.

22:19.999 --> 22:21.999
- I'm assuming that Alex
didn't ask Kate for a reference.

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
- [laughs]

22:24.999 --> 22:25.999
- Okay, there is a question

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
that's been
all over social media.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
"Emile, you are so handsome.

22:29.999 --> 22:32.000
Why do you eat
so aggressively?"

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
- You're an animal,
the way you eat.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
You deep-throat your finger.

22:38.999 --> 22:41.999
- You've got stuff
all over your mouth.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- Oh, my gosh.

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
When you're on a charter yacht,

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
sometimes you don't want
to sit down and eat.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.999
I can go to
a nice little dinner now,

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
and we can have proper cutlery,

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
have a great, nice,
sophisticated dinner,

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
but when I'm working
like a peasant,

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
I will eat like a peasant.

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
[laughter]

23:00.999 --> 23:01.999
- Where do you come up
with these?

23:01.999 --> 23:02.999
- God damn, man.

23:02.999 --> 23:03.999
- We should not have worked
him so hard.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
- I know, right?

23:05.999 --> 23:08.999
- Alex from Hudson, New York,
says, "Rocky and Emile's 'date'

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
"is a lesson for guys
in how not to get laid.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
One, get really drunk."

23:13.999 --> 23:17.999
- Do you think we can start with
a bottle of the Red Diamond?

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
And then would you
like a whiskey?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
- Yeah, why not?

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
I'll have
a Jaegermeister, please.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- Yeah.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
Okay, I've lost him.
I've lost him.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.999
- "Two, say mildly
creepy/threatening things."

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
- Who was the last girl
you dated?

23:34.999 --> 23:35.999
- I don't date.
I mate.

23:35.999 --> 23:36.999
- Oh.

23:36.999 --> 23:40.999
- Wine and dine, 69.

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
What?

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
- "Three, creep out your date
so much,

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
she dives overboard
to get away from you."

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
- Ouch.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.999
- Get me out of here.

23:53.999 --> 23:56.999
- Emile, how did it feel
to hear Rocky say

23:56.999 --> 23:59.999
that she was looking
for a real man

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
and that's why
she didn't want to date you?

24:00.999 --> 24:03.999
- Why would you think
I'm not a real man?

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
- I don't think I was ever

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
looking at you to date,
you know what I mean?

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
- Yeah.
- I think I looked at you,

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
and I was like, "Hey,
you want to go on a date?

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
Let's go have fun,
enjoy each other's company."

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
- Connie, you mentioned

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
a few times over the course
of the season

24:17.999 --> 24:21.999
that you would be happy
if Emile and Rocky were banging.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
Why did you root
for them so much?

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
- I mean, who doesn't feel
good after a good bang?

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
And with her constantly
being upset and him--

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
he needs a little bit more
than his right hand.

24:31.999 --> 24:33.999
A good bang--
that's what it does.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.999
- I always enjoy when two hot
people are sleeping together.

24:36.999 --> 24:39.000
Emile, do you think
Rocky kind of led you on?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.999
- Yes.

24:40.999 --> 24:43.999
It was like I'm being
pulled on this path,

24:43.999 --> 24:47.999
and there was just
no real end destination.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
Maybe I was naive.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
Maybe I was being immature.

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
- Don't blame yourself.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
I was convinced that you were
romantically interested in him,

24:54.999 --> 24:57.999
You were very excited
when Emile asked you out.

24:57.999 --> 24:58.999
- I was.
I was stoked.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.999
- You went to the Sky Lounge,
and you were like, "Ooh!"

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
- Emile just asked
me out on a date.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.999
[both cheering and laughing]

25:07.999 --> 25:10.999
- I think that she
did value his friendship,

25:10.999 --> 25:12.999
but I think
she also values attention.

25:12.999 --> 25:13.999
- I'm sorry if I misled you,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.999
and I just think
you're an awesome person,

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
and I'm glad that
we can be friends.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
- Do you regret
giving him the letter?

25:21.999 --> 25:23.999
- Ooh, the letter.

25:23.999 --> 25:24.999
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
- I don't know how to get
any more clear than that.

25:29.999 --> 25:33.999
Well, I was frustrated,
'cause I told him a few times,

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
and he wasn't getting it.

25:35.999 --> 25:36.999
- Did it hurt your feelings?

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
- It did upset me,
definitely.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
It was embarrassing
to do that

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
in front of
the other crew members.

25:44.999 --> 25:47.999
- Well, I texted you
a million times, saying,

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
"Hey, I'm not interested
in you."

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
So I don't know how I could get
that out there any more.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
- I think
that's bullsháá.

25:54.999 --> 25:57.999
I think Emile went
down the rosy path,

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
and I think you were definitely
leading him there.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- I'll tweet all
the messages tonight.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
- No, I don't want
to see your tweets.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
I don't want
to see your texts.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
You need to own things
that you do.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
When you get caught with your
tit in the wringer, guess what.

26:09.999 --> 26:10.999
It's because
you put it there.

26:10.999 --> 26:13.999
If you need to own it, then
you should step up to the plate.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
Emile's done it.
Eddie's done it.

26:15.999 --> 26:16.999
Everybody here has done it.

26:16.999 --> 26:20.999
The only one that I haven't
seen do it is you.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
- Let's talk
about something else.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.999
The first deckie to bite
the dust this season was Don.

26:25.999 --> 26:28.000
- Don, I understand your forte
is in engineering,

26:28.999 --> 26:29.999
but on this boat,

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
when you're on deck,
you're a deckhand.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
- Why would you use me
in such a small aspect?

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
Use me to my advantage, put me
here, let me fix a tender.

26:35.999 --> 26:36.999
Whatever you need me to fix,
I'll do it.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.999
Let me do something
that's actually hard,

26:38.999 --> 26:40.999
not sit there
and wash the decks all day.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.999
- Let's bring him out.

26:41.999 --> 26:42.999
Hey, Don.
- How you doing, sir?

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
- Good to see you.
- How you doing, Cap?

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
- Hi.
- How's it going, guys?

26:46.999 --> 26:48.999
- From the beginning, it seemed
like you didn't understand

26:48.999 --> 26:52.999
that you were doing double-duty
as a second engineer

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
and a deckhand.

26:55.999 --> 26:56.999
- If I tell you, "Listen,
I need to take it,"

26:56.999 --> 26:58.999
don't tell me to
go talk to somebody

26:58.999 --> 26:59.999
if I tell you about it.

26:59.999 --> 27:00.999
For me, it was so
out of left field.

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
- About what?

27:02.999 --> 27:03.999
- Like, "I'm your boss
'cause I'm the deckhand"--

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
I mean, for me,
that was just insulting.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.999
- But I am your boss.

27:06.999 --> 27:07.999
When you're working
the deck, I am your boss.

27:07.999 --> 27:10.999
- Were you in denial about that,
or did you just think

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
the second-engineer thing
was more important?

27:12.999 --> 27:13.999
- I was confused.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.999
I was just so confused what
was going on in that moment,

27:15.999 --> 27:17.999
so maybe I kind of got
a little hot.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
- And the boat needs its tools
to work.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
- Was that some low-key shade
right there?

27:21.999 --> 27:22.999
- No.

27:22.999 --> 27:25.999
- I think he just
called him a tool.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.999
- So usually how this whole
thing works with the engineer

27:27.999 --> 27:28.999
is you engineer first,
and you do deckhand second.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
That's the more important aspect
of it, right?

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
I was just so confused
about what was going on,

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
and like I said--

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
- I know you were confused,
clearly,

27:34.999 --> 27:39.999
but sometimes you need to step
back and fall into place.

27:39.999 --> 27:42.999
- We would be given
specific instructions,

27:42.999 --> 27:44.999
like, laid out, really simple
things to do,

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
but, "No, no, no.
I'm gonna do it my way."

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
- Put these over
and actually tie these up.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
Everything's on.
They're out of our way.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
So we're not hopping over each
other and getting stuck.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
I'll take the blame for it.
Just put it on me.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
Think about it.
What am I doing right now?

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
Bro, you're just not right
for this, man.

28:01.999 --> 28:02.999
You know that, right?

28:02.999 --> 28:03.999
And it's like, "No,

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
they tell you what
to do, you do it."

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
Whether you agree
with it or not,

28:05.999 --> 28:07.999
they're in that position
for a reason.

28:07.999 --> 28:09.999
- You have how many years'
experience on boats?

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
- Almost ten.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
- So why would you follow Rocky
into the water?

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
- [chuckles]

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
- Oh, I want to go in.

28:24.999 --> 28:25.999
I don't know.
I was in lust.

28:25.999 --> 28:27.999
- You were in lust?
- Yeah, she's cute.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
- To be fair,
you weren't the only one

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
to be lured in by Rocky.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
- I know.
Emile was in love, huh?

28:34.999 --> 28:37.999
- Actually, talk about that
a little bit later, Eddie.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.000
Janet from Minneapolis says,

28:39.999 --> 28:40.999
"Don, I can't believe you quit.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
Captain Lee was just gonna
give you a warning."

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
- You're here to work, period.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
Every time I see you
standing around doing nothing,

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
I'll tell you about it,
and I'm the only person

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
you've got to please
on this boat.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
- I don't think this scenario's
gonna be good for me,

28:52.999 --> 28:53.999
and I think at this point,

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
I'm gonna have to give
my notice.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
I'm sorry, but--

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is.

28:57.999 --> 29:00.999
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:00.999 --> 29:01.999
- As soon as I got on land,

29:01.999 --> 29:04.999
I was like,
"What'd I just do?"

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
- Some of you may have
celebrated Don's departure,

29:06.999 --> 29:10.999
but in a classic case of
"be careful what you wish for,"

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
Don's replacement was Dane,

29:12.999 --> 29:13.999
and he turned out to be

29:13.999 --> 29:18.999
one of the most
dysfunctional deckhands ever.

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
I should say that Dane

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
was invited
to join us for this reunion,

29:22.999 --> 29:25.999
but since leaving the boat, he
has cut off all communication.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- I actually would've
loved that.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
- I thought it would have been
pretty entertaining.

29:29.999 --> 29:30.999
- I think it would be
entertaining.

29:30.999 --> 29:32.999
- I'm interested
to hear what he thinks.

29:32.999 --> 29:33.999
- Yeah.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
- We would have had a bottle
of Crown available, right?

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
- Kate, Amy, and Connie,

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
you were initially
attracted to Dane.

29:38.999 --> 29:41.999
You were happy to see him.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.999
- Is that really him?

29:43.999 --> 29:45.999
- Do you see him?
- Cute.

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
- Oh, yeah.

29:49.999 --> 29:50.999
- Oh, gosh.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.999
Totally caught us.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
- We were two decks up,
four weeks in.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
- Yeah, it's always nice to get
a new crew member.

29:56.999 --> 29:59.999
- It was, like...
- Dude.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.999
- When did you first know that
Dane was gonna be a problem?

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
- Might have been
when he drove the jet ski

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
into the side of the boat.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
- All right,
shut it off.

30:07.999 --> 30:08.999
[crash]
- Sháá.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.000
- God damn it.

30:10.999 --> 30:11.999
Or it might have been
when he sucked down

30:11.999 --> 30:14.999
a half of bottle
of Crown Royal by himself.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
Endless list.

30:21.999 --> 30:24.999
- Dane's dysfunction
reached its peak

30:24.999 --> 30:27.999
on your night off
at Lubbers' Landing.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
Terry from
Jacksonville, Florida, said,

30:28.999 --> 30:32.000
"Eddie, I can't believe how
drunk and belligerent Dane was.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.999
"How close did you come
to punching him?

30:33.999 --> 30:36.000
"Were you secretly hoping that
he would throw the first punch

30:36.999 --> 30:37.999
so you could knock him out?"

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
- Dude, fáááing slow down.
- Fááá, dude, do not--

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
- Get your finger
out of my face.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
- He has no boundaries.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- Get off it.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
Get off it, now!

30:46.999 --> 30:48.999
Back off.
- What--

30:48.999 --> 30:49.999
- Eddie,
what happened that night?

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
- Well, we were having
a great night.

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
The hosts--or the owners of the
resort were really nice to us,

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
and they--you know,
it was getting later at night,

30:55.999 --> 30:59.999
and they said, "You guys
can make a drink if you'd like.

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
"You know, just make sure
you write it down

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
so that we can
charge you for it."

31:02.999 --> 31:03.999
Well, Dane took that as

31:03.999 --> 31:06.999
him having free reign of
whatever he wanted from the bar,

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
and so at that point
he was already sháá-faced.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
Excuse me.
He was very drunk.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
And it's disrespectful
to these owners

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
that are being
so generous to us.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
You know, I would never
have thrown the first punch.

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
- Right.
- But if he tried anything,

31:19.999 --> 31:23.999
I probably
would have reacted.

31:23.999 --> 31:26.999
[laughter]
- Yeah.

31:26.999 --> 31:27.999
- Captain Lee,
now that you've seen the footage

31:27.999 --> 31:29.999
of what happened,
how do you think Eddie

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
handled things that night?
- Well.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
- Don, when you
watched Dane's story unfold,

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
were you relieved or satisfied?

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
- I giggled.
- You giggled.

31:37.999 --> 31:39.999
- [laughs]
It felt good.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.999
- Anything you want to say
to Captain Lee?

31:41.999 --> 31:44.999
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
To the whole crew.

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
You know, I kind of
left them at a hard time.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
I've been kicking my ass for
that from the day it happened.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
Hopefully one day I can make it
to this guy, and thank you guys.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
I apologize for leaving,
and thank you so much.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.000
- No problem, buddy.
- All right.

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
Thank you, my friend.
Give me some love.

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
- Yeah, thank you.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.999
- Don, thanks for joining us.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.999
Coming up...

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- During the fire,
there was a mug with wine in it.

32:04.999 --> 32:07.999
- So wait, you're accusing Kate
of drinking on charter?

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
- Yeah.
You were drunk and hammered.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
I was like, "Hey, I'm having
a really hard time here.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
- We're gonna have a sleeping
pretty boy in a second.

32:22.999 --> 32:24.999
Can you do me a favor?

32:24.999 --> 32:25.999
- Oh, my God.
- There you go.

32:25.999 --> 32:26.999
- Chug.
- Thank you.

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
- Shotgun.
- All right.

32:27.999 --> 32:30.999
Don't chug the whole thing.
Just--it's okay.

32:30.999 --> 32:31.999
- You're gonna
have a heart attack.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
- That was quick.

32:34.999 --> 32:37.999
- I mean, this kid
is so hopped up on the--

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- Yeah.
I need to go the restroom again.

32:39.999 --> 32:40.999
- Now wait a minute.
I'm sitting next to you.

32:40.999 --> 32:43.999
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Five minutes.

32:43.999 --> 32:44.999
- Oh, my God.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.000
- Emile, did
you wash your hands?

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
Now are you all normalized?

32:50.999 --> 32:51.999
- That's way better.

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
- Kate, the biggest battle that
raged on the yacht this season

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
was between you and Chef Leon.

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
You hated bunking together.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
You couldn't work
with one another.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
And his obsession
with beef cheeks

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
almost drove you over the edge.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.000
- Do you want to cook?
Would you like to cook?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.999
Are you any good at cooking?
- I told you I make--

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- Then don't come out
with that bullsháá to me, yeah?

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
Please, don't.
Don't insult me.

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
I just want to say something.
I don't like you one bit.

33:16.999 --> 33:17.999
Is that okay?

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
It's not like
you say it to other people?

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
- I--
- I do not like you one bit.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
- How you spoke to me
was a personal attack.

33:23.999 --> 33:25.999
- I really don't give a fááá.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.999
Will we be friends?
Never.

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
Thank you.

33:30.999 --> 33:34.000
- Have you ever had such
a toxic working relationship?

33:34.999 --> 33:38.999
- No. I was looking for any kind
of workable quality with Leon,

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
but from the moment I met him,

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
I was like, "So we're gonna
be roommates, best friends!"

33:42.999 --> 33:43.999
He was like, "Do you keep
a clean bathroom?"

33:43.999 --> 33:46.999
He was just so aggressive
from the get-go.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
- Kate, it seems
like you have a thing

33:48.999 --> 33:52.999
with people who you
don't consider real yachties.

33:52.999 --> 33:53.999
- Leon is a great guy.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.999
He's been on 12 yachts before.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
- He worked
on the "Queen Elizabeth II,"

33:57.999 --> 33:58.999
which is not actually a yacht.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.999
It's actually a very small
cruise ship.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
- But he's worked
on 12 different yachts.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
- Okay.
That makes sense.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.999
I don't have a problem
with people not being a yachtie,

34:06.999 --> 34:09.999
but I have a problem with people
not being a team player

34:09.999 --> 34:12.999
and, like, a control freak
and not going with the flow.

34:12.999 --> 34:13.999
'Cause that's needed--
- It seems like you do have

34:13.999 --> 34:15.999
a problem with people
not being a yachtie.

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
- A yachtie, to me, is somebody
who goes with the flow,

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
is a team player
and a hard worker.

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
Those are great qualities.

34:21.999 --> 34:22.999
I'm proud to be a yachtie.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- Sarah from Raleigh,
North Carolinam said,

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
"Kate, be honest.

34:25.999 --> 34:28.999
"Right off the bat,
your real issue with Leon

34:28.999 --> 34:29.999
was that he wasn't Ben."

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
- Actually, I knew that
this question would come up,

34:31.999 --> 34:34.999
so I was trying extra hard
to like anybody,

34:34.999 --> 34:37.999
look for some kind of glimmer
of something to, like--

34:37.999 --> 34:38.999
'cause I didn't want
to be accused of that.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
I was self-conscious of that.

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
But he made
it pretty much impossible.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.999
- I should mention we invited
Chef Leon to join us today,

34:46.999 --> 34:48.999
and he declined our invitation.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
You're still in good touch
with him, right?

34:50.999 --> 34:51.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:51.999 --> 34:52.999
- He's a good
friend of mine.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
- What's he saying
about the season?

34:54.999 --> 34:58.999
- I think when he left
the yacht, he was done.

34:58.999 --> 34:59.999
You know?

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
And...

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
I just feel like
it's really hard to share

35:05.999 --> 35:08.999
'cause I just feel, like...

35:08.999 --> 35:10.999
Yeah.
Um...you know?

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
- Do you think
he was treated unfairly?

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- I think it's really hard

35:13.999 --> 35:18.999
after working in kitchens
and being a chef and cooking

35:18.999 --> 35:21.999
and putting your art out there
and having somebody talk bad

35:21.999 --> 35:24.999
about your food and your art
constantly behind your back--

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
- You talked bad about it too.
- You used to say that.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
You were the one
who was talking so much--

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
because you were like, "I could
do so much better than this,

35:29.999 --> 35:30.999
and I could kill it."

35:30.999 --> 35:31.999
- Traditionally, the scallop--

35:31.999 --> 35:35.999
it needs to be seared
on high, high heat,

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
and the top needs
to have a nice, good sear on it,

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
and it was kind of,
like, out of time,

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
so it was just like
a one hit, boom.

35:40.999 --> 35:41.999
And it should have been
longer.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
Should have been
longer on that.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.999
A good scallop has a nice
golden sear on it.

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
- I love scallops, yeah.
- Oh, it turns me on.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
- I actually
respect your passion

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
for cooking more than Leon's,

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
'cause you were like, "I'll
try something new and crazy."

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
At least you're
trying something new.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
- What's your evidence that he
didn't have a passion for it?

35:57.999 --> 36:02.999
- He served the same things
every single charter.

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
- But let me ask you--
what is the problem with that?

36:04.999 --> 36:05.999
- Okay, I'll explain that.

36:05.999 --> 36:06.999
- The guests
aren't repeating meals.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.999
And by the way, every time
the guest got the beef cheeks,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
they said, "Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.999
This couldn't be better."

36:13.999 --> 36:16.999
- It's kind of like a magician
that has two tricks only.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
- But if all that's required
of you is two tricks...

36:18.999 --> 36:20.000
- But that's symptomatic.
- Maybe that's enough.

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
- No, because then
if somebody asks--

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
order a quesadilla,
he'd be like,

36:23.999 --> 36:25.999
"Mm, not one of my tricks."

36:25.999 --> 36:26.999
He just would put
the beef cheeks--the beef--

36:26.999 --> 36:29.000
[all talking at once]

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
He would put them
in a sous vide...

36:30.999 --> 36:31.999
- We had to make the food
late night.

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
- The first day,
and let it sit for 36 hours.

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
It was a trick,

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
and he would serve it 36 hours
on the second night,

36:37.999 --> 36:41.999
because if you put a protein
in a crock pot for that long,

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
eventually it's gonna be like,
"I surrender. I'm tender."

36:43.999 --> 36:44.999
It was not even skill.

36:44.999 --> 36:47.999
- I'm friends with Leon.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
I still am in contact with him.
He's on a boat now.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
He's doing well for himself.
He was just--

36:51.999 --> 36:53.000
- Yeah, he's the executive chef
on a really, really big boat.

36:53.999 --> 36:54.999
- Yeah, yeah.
Can I quickly finish?

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
- I'm sure it's very large.
- Can I just quickly finish?

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
He's really good
at what he does.

36:58.999 --> 36:59.999
He was just
on the wrong boat.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.999
I agree with what
everybody says.

37:01.999 --> 37:02.999
He didn't want to be there.

37:02.999 --> 37:05.999
- Well, Eddie, you've worked
with Kate for two seasons now.

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
You've seen how
she can be confrontational

37:07.999 --> 37:09.999
with some of the crewmates.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.999
Whose side were you on
in this Kate versus Leon?

37:12.999 --> 37:13.999
- Looking back on it,

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
I mean, I do have to say,
I think, you know,

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
that Kate was right on
a lot of things,

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
and Leon's a good chef.

37:19.999 --> 37:20.999
I liked working
with him.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
I liked rooming with him,
but he just--

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
He didn't care much.

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
I think that Leon
could have been

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
a little more
passionate about his job,

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
and had been
more respectful.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.999
- He's a great guy.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
He's a great guy.
- He told me to be careful.

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
He said he liked
to make girls cry.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- I come from hard kitchens.

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
So, when I opened my own
restaurants,

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
I'd be screaming at girls,
screaming, making 'em cry.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.999
- You can put anything
in an interview.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
- Nobody said, "Hey, Leon.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
Tell the world
you love to make girls cry."

37:49.000 --> 37:51.999
- The things
that I overheard from Leon--

37:51.999 --> 37:52.999
which, by the way,

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
I know you're
a fan of his--

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
nobody prompted him
to say.

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
He said all on his own,

37:57.999 --> 37:59.999
of his own volition.

37:59.999 --> 38:02.999
I didn't appreciate and wouldn't
appreciate from anybody.

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
- I just think I gravitated
towards Chef Leon

38:04.999 --> 38:07.999
because that's
what I have been doing,

38:07.999 --> 38:08.999
and that's what I do on yachts,

38:08.999 --> 38:11.999
and so, yeah, of course
I'm gonna support him.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
- Why?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- Because I know how hard it is
to put out your art

38:14.999 --> 38:17.999
and your energy out there
and get constantly criticized.

38:17.999 --> 38:18.999
- It wasn't art.
- No, oh, no, no.

38:18.999 --> 38:19.999
- It was paint by numbers
every trip.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
- No. I'm calling
bullsháá on that.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.999
Leon sat right there
in the goddamn galley,

38:24.999 --> 38:26.000
and he said,
"I could really

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
knock their socks off
if I wanted to."

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
- "If I wanted to."
- Yeah.

38:29.999 --> 38:30.999
- "I just don't want to."

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
And when he was called
up to the galley,

38:32.999 --> 38:33.999
he goes, "I don't want to see
these fáááing assáááá,"

38:34.000 --> 38:37.999
when they called him up to pay
him a compliment on his food.

38:37.999 --> 38:38.999
- That's not a charter chef.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.999
- And you're gonna sit there
and go like, "Poor Leon"?

38:42.999 --> 38:44.999
- I love that guy.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.999
- Like, he didn't
own any of that? Bullsháá.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.999
- Kate and Leon's combustible
relationship resulted

38:49.999 --> 38:53.999
in literal sparks when a fire
broke out in the galley.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.999
Leon was napping.
Kate was cooking,

38:56.999 --> 38:59.999
and everybody had an opinion
about who was at fault.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.999
[smoke alarm going off]
- It's a fire--that's a fire.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
- Where?
- It's in there.

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
- Oh, my eyes.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
[smoke alarm continues]
- What is going on?

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
- There's an actual fire
in the oven.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.999
[smoke alarm continuing]

39:13.999 --> 39:16.999
- Close the door.
- Here.

39:16.999 --> 39:19.999
- My opinion--and I was the one
to go attend the fire first--

39:19.999 --> 39:20.999
There were two pans
in the oven,

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
and then there was
a pizza in there,

39:22.999 --> 39:24.999
and I just would have
pulled out the pans

39:24.999 --> 39:27.999
before I would put something
else in the oven.

39:27.999 --> 39:28.999
- Now I'm not culinary trained,

39:28.999 --> 39:31.999
but pans are meant
to go in ovens, right?

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
- [giggling]

39:33.999 --> 39:34.999
- But then there's,
like, drippings from the pizza

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
that can get on that,
and then--

39:36.999 --> 39:37.999
- No, no, no, no.

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
The pizza was still frozen
when it came out of the oven.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
- Yeah.
- There was no drippings.

39:41.999 --> 39:44.999
The stuff that caught fire
was from three days prior,

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
and, if you remember correctly,

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
you had pulled out
a grate in the oven

39:48.999 --> 39:51.999
and commented on how dirty
the oven was at that time.

39:51.999 --> 39:52.999
And it was smoking.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.999
- Captain Lee,
why did you ultimately

39:54.999 --> 39:56.999
decide that Leon was at fault?

39:56.999 --> 39:59.999
- The fire was a direct result
of a dirty--dirty oven.

39:59.999 --> 40:03.000
Plain and simple.
That's his responsibility,

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
and it was also
his responsibility

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
to be up cooking for the guests,

40:07.999 --> 40:10.999
not having a stew
or a sous-chef do it.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
Whether it's 2:00 in the morning

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
or 2:00 in the afternoon,
his job.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Now that you've all seen
the fire

40:16.999 --> 40:19.999
and how it started, does anyone
here think Leon got a bad rap?

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
- No, it was definitely
'cause of a dirty oven.

40:21.999 --> 40:22.999
- Actually, during the fire,

40:22.999 --> 40:27.999
there was a mug with wine in it
that Kate had been drinking.

40:27.999 --> 40:30.999
- So wait, you're accusing Kate
of drinking on charter?

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
Coming up...
- That's fine.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.999
I'm not gonna win this one.
- I was in the galley--

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
- I get it.

40:37.999 --> 40:38.999
- If you could just stop
talking for a second.

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
I was in the galley making
popcorn for the guests.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
You didn't know
how to work the DVD player,

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
so I said, "I'll leave you
in the galley,"

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
and I came back down,
and everything was on fire.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
does anyone here
think Leon got a bad rap?

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
- No, it was definitely
'cause of a dirty oven.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- Actually, during the fire,

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
there was a mug with wine
in it...

40:58.999 --> 41:00.999
- Oh, my God.
- That Kate had been drinking,

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
and I go to Eddie--

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
and he's obviously not
gonna back me on this one.

41:04.999 --> 41:07.999
And I said, "Eddie, there's
a mug over there with wine,

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
"and that's Kate's,
and she had been drinking in it.

41:09.999 --> 41:10.999
What should we do?"

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
And he goes, "Don't worry.
I'll take care of it."

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
And he goes over,
grabs the mug,

41:16.999 --> 41:19.999
and slyly pours out
the alcohol,

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
and then he comes to me,

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
and he says,
"We take care of our own."

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
And I was like, "Oh, okay."
- Eddie?

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember that?

41:26.999 --> 41:28.000
- Oh, you don't remember?
That's better than a no.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.999
- So, Captain, if this is true,
what's your reaction to this?

41:30.999 --> 41:33.999
- I'm sure I would have dealt
with it accordingly at the time.

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
- Is that a plane ticket?
- We would have

41:34.999 --> 41:35.999
a serious confrontation
about it.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
- Were you drinking on charter?

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
- No,
and we've never had an issue,

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
and Leon said the same thing.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.999
- So there's two people
that have said that.

41:43.999 --> 41:45.999
- Leon admitted
that he lied about it.

41:45.999 --> 41:46.999
- He did not lie about it.

41:46.999 --> 41:47.999
- What really happened was--

41:47.999 --> 41:49.999
- That's fine.
I-I'm not gonna win this one.

41:49.999 --> 41:50.999
- I was in the galley--
- I get it.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
- If you could just stop
talking for a second.

41:51.999 --> 41:54.999
I was in the galley making
popcorn for the guests.

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
You didn't know
how to work the DVD player,

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
which you should have.

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
"The guests want popcorn
to watch their movie,

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
but I don't know how to do it."

42:00.000 --> 42:01.999
So I said, "I'll leave you

42:01.999 --> 42:02.999
"in the galley
where you're comfortable,

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
"where you're trained,

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
and I'll go
do what I'm good at,"

42:06.999 --> 42:07.999
and I came back down,

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
and everything was on fire.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
- The pointing the fingers
about the drinking

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
and this and that is--
it's petty.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
It really is.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
Like, it's ridiculous.

42:16.999 --> 42:19.999
- Get a backbone.

42:19.999 --> 42:22.999
- Next week, it's part two
of the "Below Deck" reunion.

42:22.999 --> 42:26.999
Chef Ben, let's bring him out.
- Whoo!

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
- Dave's here too.
- Whoo!

42:28.999 --> 42:32.999
- You were featured in
my favorite Bravo promo.

42:32.999 --> 42:35.999
What'd your wife think of it?
- It's still working for her.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- Yeah.
- Oof.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- You and Eddie kind of
gave new meaning

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
to the term "dirty laundry."

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
- Usually friends with benefits
act like friends.

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
- Diving off the boat was

42:43.999 --> 42:46.999
the dumbest thing
you possibly could have done.

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
- In the middle of the ocean,

42:47.999 --> 42:48.999
read my phone.
"Your dad died."

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
Six months later,
"Your grandma died."

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
- Does Kate get along
with anybody?

42:52.999 --> 42:53.999
- You were picking fights.

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
- I think you may have been
a little tired,

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
honey bunny.

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
- You should have been fired.

42:58.999 --> 42:59.999
You should never have been
back there--I had enough of it.

42:59.999 --> 43:02.999
- Was there a part
of you that was jealous?

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
So did you cut things off then?
- I definitely didn't have

43:04.999 --> 43:07.000
any kind of sexual interaction
with her anymore.

43:07.999 --> 43:08.999
- What about two times
after the show?

43:08.999 --> 43:10.999
- Ooh!
- [laughs]

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
- Are you denying that?

43:12.999 --> 43:15.999
