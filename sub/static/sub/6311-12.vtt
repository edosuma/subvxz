08:53.489 --> 08:56.536
So we'’re not gonna play
"pin the hose on the fireman"?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.625
I think not.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.583
Darn.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.891
You know, um, as much
fun as this is,

09:03.978 --> 09:05.893
I actually have to go.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.025
Uh, Marjorie,
congratulations.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.026
I'’ll see you
at the wedding.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.332
Okay.
Bye.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.725
Thanks, sweetie.

09:11.812 --> 09:12.813
You'’re leaving already?

09:12.900 --> 09:14.075
We'’re just getting started.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.511
Yeah, I got a thing.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.209
Would the thing'’s name
be Travis perchance?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.037
His last name
is Sullivan.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.303
Jodi, isn'’t it a little soon
for you to start dating?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.218
Thank you. That'’s what
I'’ve been telling her,

09:27.305 --> 09:28.524
and she won'’t listen.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.917
Did you tell her
how you ignored

09:30.004 --> 09:31.222
my dating advice
when you were new?

09:33.398 --> 09:34.791
No, Marjorie.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.315
I thought that might
undermine my purpose.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.798
Jodi, the guy
just kicked heroin.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.104
Yeah, he kicked it.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.279
He'’s been clean
for six weeks.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.759
Marjorie, tell her.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.282
Tell her what?
That I wasn'’t capable

09:47.369 --> 09:50.285
of having a real relationship
with anyone

09:50.372 --> 09:53.114
until almost two years
after I kicked heroin.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.599
How much did she hear?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.209
Just the part about the heroin.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.604
Can I go now?

10:04.691 --> 10:05.909
No one'’s stopping you.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.302
Just be smart, okay?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.608
I will.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.913
[quietly]:
Bye.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.264
Anya, how you doing in there?

10:13.351 --> 10:16.093
Go away,
junkie whore!

10:19.227 --> 10:21.272
Well, she'’s not coming out
anytime soon.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.274
Let'’s go dig into that penis.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.454
Let'’s go, Mom!

10:29.541 --> 10:31.326
I can'’t find
my new earrings!

10:31.413 --> 10:32.980
That'’s '’cause I'’m wearing them!

10:33.067 --> 10:35.373
Come on, we'’ve got
a bride to marry off.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.332
Who told you you could
borrow my earrings?

10:37.419 --> 10:39.464
Well, I can'’t borrow
your shoes, now can I?

10:39.551 --> 10:40.683
Let'’s go.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.294
[cell phone ringing]Oh.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.210
We'’re on our way,
Marjorie.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.691
Oh, for God'’s sake.What?

10:48.778 --> 10:50.954
Anya'’s refusing
to go to the wedding.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.695
Why?
Why?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.566
She doesn'’t approve of Marjorie.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.700
So? I don'’t approve
of her and I'’m going.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.354
Give me.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.225
Marjorie, screw her.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.400
This is your day.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.620
Don'’t let that old hag ruin it.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.361
Who cares if Victor'’s depressed?

11:06.448 --> 11:08.755
It isn'’t his day, either.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.845
This is about you.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.934
She'’s crying.
I'’m out.

11:15.762 --> 11:19.113
Marjorie, where'’s
that Armenian buzzkill now?

11:21.593 --> 11:23.117
Okay, you just relax.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.335
We'’ll take care of everything.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.861
Never mind how we get her there.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.340
It'’s probably better
you don'’t know.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.429
How do you want
to play this?

11:31.516 --> 11:33.693
The usual-- good cop, bad cop.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.999
Oh, come on!
Why can'’t you be the bad cop?

11:36.086 --> 11:37.131
We'’ve been through this.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.655
I'’m too adorable!

11:49.621 --> 11:51.058
This is a cheerful
little cottage.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.408
Does she live here or
did it fall on her?

11:55.192 --> 11:58.108
[cell phone ringing]

11:58.195 --> 11:59.675
Oh, damn!

11:59.762 --> 12:02.460
Jodi, kind of got
my hand full right now.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.419
ANYA:
Who is it?

12:04.506 --> 12:06.900
Hey, Anya,
it'’s, uh, Christy and Bonnie.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.640
Remember from the party?

12:08.728 --> 12:09.903
I-I can'’t talk right now.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.426
I'’ll see you at the wedding.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.123
Honey, I got to run.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.125
Go away!

12:15.212 --> 12:17.824
You'’re up.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.478
Anya, I-I know
this is a tough time,

12:20.565 --> 12:23.307
but we just need
five minutes, please?

12:23.394 --> 12:24.613
What happened to bad cop?

12:24.700 --> 12:25.745
Hang on.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.834
I told you...
Ooh! Ow! Ow!

12:27.921 --> 12:30.097
Open the big door or I pull you
through the little door!

12:30.184 --> 12:31.925
Oh! Oh!

12:32.012 --> 12:33.143
Why do I ever doubt you?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.579
Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:34.666 --> 12:36.930
Five minutes,
then you go.

12:37.017 --> 12:37.974
[clears her throat]

12:38.061 --> 12:40.063
Thanks.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.152
You have a lovely home.

12:42.239 --> 12:45.112
Yes, very Rosemary'’s Baby.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.811
Go ahead, talk.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.205
Anya, you must know

12:51.292 --> 12:53.294
that your brother and Marjorie
are just devastated

12:53.381 --> 12:55.252
that you'’re not coming
to the wedding.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.427
Good.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.255
Yeah, good.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.997
But they'’re still
gonna get married

13:01.084 --> 13:05.480
and I think you need to ask
yourself 20 years from now,

13:05.567 --> 13:07.134
do you want to look
back at this moment

13:07.221 --> 13:08.744
and be filled with regret

13:08.831 --> 13:11.529
that you refused to
share in their happiness?

13:11.616 --> 13:15.229
20 years from now,
I expect to be dead.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.189
Okay, ten years.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.800
Still dead.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.541
You want to jump in here?

13:23.628 --> 13:25.500
No, you'’re doing great.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.808
I think we may
have given you

13:28.895 --> 13:31.114
the wrong impression
about Marjorie

13:31.201 --> 13:32.681
at the bachelorette party.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.596
What, that she
is a horrible person?

13:34.683 --> 13:36.728
That she is no good
for my brother?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.339
Well, that may
have been true

13:38.426 --> 13:41.559
many years ago,

13:41.646 --> 13:45.433
but now she'’s a kind
and loving person,

13:45.520 --> 13:47.565
who helps a lot of people.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.742
No, people like her
don'’t change.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.701
That'’s not true.
We'’ve changed.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.181
I mean, I'’ve changed.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.227
She'’s working on it.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.794
That'’s nice.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.101
But I'’m not crazy
about you two, either.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.844
Is it your turn yet?

14:04.931 --> 14:07.150
Fine.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.717
You like brandy?

14:08.804 --> 14:09.370
Yes.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.501
Prove it.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.987
Oh, let'’s get
this party started!

14:19.162 --> 14:20.772
Anya, you came!

14:20.860 --> 14:23.079
Oh, Victor, my brother!

14:23.166 --> 14:24.776
Oh, is she drunk?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.126
I hope so.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.389
She flashed her boobs
at a school bus.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.435
I'’m sorry
if I upset you, Victor.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.612
I-I was just afraid
of losing you.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.659
Oh, little one,
you could never lose me.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.575
You'’ll come and live
with me and Marjorie.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.578
Oh, God,
what have we done?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.931
Be blessed by
the Holy Spirit.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.411
We part in peace.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.326
And may the Lord be with you.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.240
I kiss now?

14:53.327 --> 14:55.677
You kiss now.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.902
[whooping]

15:10.735 --> 15:12.563
ANYA:
Wait! Wait! Wait!

15:12.650 --> 15:14.609
I'’m coming
to live with you!

15:14.696 --> 15:16.611
What'’s this now?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.922
Well, she did it.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.532
She'’s a married woman.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.143
One down, four to go.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.840
I'’ll bet you'’re next.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.277
Why not you?

15:30.364 --> 15:32.540
Oh, no, I'’m done with marriage.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.151
Oh, come on,
you'’ll find love again.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.761
Oh, of course
I'’ll find love.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.503
Just don'’t want
to give up my alimony.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.896
Good for you.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.203
Suck '’em dry.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.945
[phone buzzing]

15:46.032 --> 15:48.556
Oh, this ought to be good.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.558
Hey, Jodi, where are you?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.996
You missed the ceremony.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.824
Yeah, this is Christy Plunkett.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.130
Who'’s this?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.438
I don'’t understand.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.657
Where'’s Jodi?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.793
No, that can'’t be.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.317
What'’s going on?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.710
But she'’s supposed
to be here with us.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.147
Christy, what'’s happening?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.020
Jodi overdosed.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.153
Is she gonna be okay?

16:21.937 --> 16:23.504
She'’s gone.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.374
[gasps]

16:24.461 --> 16:26.333
No...

16:29.031 --> 16:31.686
Yes, Officer,
I'’m still here.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.653
[crying]:
I can'’t believe it.

16:42.740 --> 16:46.005
She was fine
at the party.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.311
How did this happen?

16:48.398 --> 16:50.357
All I know is they

16:50.444 --> 16:52.707
[sniffles]
found her

16:52.794 --> 16:56.580
in the bathroom
at her apartment.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.367
Apparently, her boyfriend

17:00.454 --> 17:01.846
called 911 and took off.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.240
[sniffling]

17:09.115 --> 17:11.073
How are we gonna
tell Marjorie?

17:13.728 --> 17:15.904
We'’re not.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.862
What do you
mean we'’re not?

17:24.173 --> 17:26.088
Here'’s how this is gonna go.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.483
We'’re all going
to the reception

17:29.570 --> 17:32.399
and we'’re gonna pretend
to have a good time.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.488
and we'’re gonna get
Marjorie off on her honeymoon

17:34.575 --> 17:36.446
without her knowing anything.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.797
Doesn'’t Marjorie deserve...?

17:39.884 --> 17:41.756
No!

17:41.843 --> 17:44.715
Marjorie deserves to be happy.

17:44.802 --> 17:48.458
We'’ll tell her after
she gets back from the cruise.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.983
Christy, I don'’t, I-I don'’t
think I can hold it together.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.378
Yeah, well, you will.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.252
All of us will.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.036
[door opens]

18:01.123 --> 18:02.559
What are you doing in here?

18:02.646 --> 18:03.604
Come outside.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.127
We'’re taking pictures.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.911
We'’re coming.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.784
What'’s the crying about?

18:09.871 --> 18:12.047
We'’re just so happy for you!

18:12.134 --> 18:13.701
[laughs]

18:13.788 --> 18:15.572
Thank you, girls.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.792
Where'’s Jodi?

18:17.879 --> 18:19.446
She couldn'’t make it.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
Ah, that'’s a shame.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.538
When you talk to her,
give her my love.
