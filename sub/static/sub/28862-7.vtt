<i>People are peculiar creatures.</i>

00:21.963 --> 00:25.047
<i>All their actions are driven by desire,</i>

00:27.713 --> 00:30.672
<i>their characters forged by pain.</i>

00:37.380 --> 00:40.630
<i>As much as they might try</i>
<i>to suppress the pain,</i>

00:42.255 --> 00:44.047
<i>to repress desire,</i>

00:46.130 --> 00:51.880
<i>they cannot liberate themselves</i>
<i>from eternal servitude to their feelings.</i>

00:57.547 --> 01:00.130
<i>As long as the storm rages within them</i>

01:01.713 --> 01:03.380
<i>they can find no peace.</i>

01:05.380 --> 01:06.797
<i>Not in life,</i>

01:09.338 --> 01:10.588
<i>not in death.</i>

01:13.880 --> 01:17.338
<i>And so, day after day,</i>
<i>they will do all that must be done.</i>

01:18.088 --> 01:19.755
<i>Pain is their ship,</i>

01:21.130 --> 01:23.088
<i>desire their compass.</i>

01:26.672 --> 01:29.172
<i>All that humankind is capable of.</i>

JUNE 26, 1954

02:59.255 --> 03:02.922
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

03:07.005 --> 03:09.380
The deceased woman is 5' 7".

03:09.463 --> 03:10.838
Caucasian.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.630
Probably 75

03:14.047 --> 03:15.588
to 80 years old.

03:15.672 --> 03:18.380
Cause of death, a shot to the chest.

03:19.463 --> 03:21.338
The eyes are notable.

03:22.255 --> 03:24.547
One blue, one brown.

03:25.213 --> 03:26.880
It's known as heterochromia.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.422
This woman, she...

03:36.672 --> 03:38.672
She was at the police station.

03:39.755 --> 03:42.380
The same day Helge reappeared.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.172
And?

03:45.255 --> 03:46.797
She was confused.

03:47.463 --> 03:48.963
Not entirely there.

03:50.588 --> 03:53.047
She apologized for something, I...

03:54.713 --> 03:57.005
I didn't understand for what.

03:58.213 --> 04:00.547
The same day Helge came back?

04:04.963 --> 04:07.213
Maybe she's the madman's accomplice.

04:08.088 --> 04:09.755
Could be his mother.

04:10.838 --> 04:13.297
And she had Helge with her the whole time.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.213
There's something else.

04:17.713 --> 04:19.922
I only happened upon it by chance.

04:21.297 --> 04:22.380
Her body

04:23.005 --> 04:24.755
is heavily contaminated.

04:28.547 --> 04:29.630
Here.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.047
All over.

04:34.797 --> 04:39.380
She must've been exposed
to heavy radiation for a prolonged period.

04:39.672 --> 04:40.838
Peculiar.

04:40.922 --> 04:44.422
Perhaps she worked as a radiographer.

04:44.505 --> 04:46.005
A radiographer?

04:49.422 --> 04:53.672
Visit the Doppler boy. Show him her photo.
Maybe he'll recognize her.

05:05.047 --> 05:06.880
<i>The data indicates</i>

05:06.963 --> 05:10.130
that the particle regularly decays
into two protons,

05:11.005 --> 05:14.922
at a mass of 125 gigaelectronvolts.

05:23.255 --> 05:26.963
In one case, however,
it decayed into four muons.

05:28.422 --> 05:30.130
You're already here?

05:33.838 --> 05:35.588
I must've lost track of time.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.838
What day is it?

05:40.547 --> 05:41.838
It's...

05:41.922 --> 05:43.547
June 26.

05:44.713 --> 05:46.422
Did you spend all night here?

05:48.422 --> 05:51.047
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

05:51.172 --> 05:52.172
June 26...

05:55.880 --> 05:57.172
Is something wrong?

05:59.213 --> 06:02.838
I rescheduled the meeting with the French
for this morning.

06:07.463 --> 06:08.713
Ms. Tiedemann?

06:42.005 --> 06:43.088
Mom?

07:41.755 --> 07:45.713
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR?

07:54.838 --> 07:56.838
It all has to do with me.

08:00.505 --> 08:03.463
Noah said the world will end tomorrow.

08:05.672 --> 08:08.130
And that only the people
in the bunker will survive.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.963
And he said she's alive.

08:30.463 --> 08:31.672
My mother.

08:42.547 --> 08:45.463
The documents
from the Marburg passport office are here.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.672
As you suspected,

08:49.755 --> 08:54.005
in that time frame there's only one entry
for an Aleksander Köhler.

08:54.422 --> 08:59.588
And then the eyes saw, the ears heard
and nothing remained concealed.

09:00.338 --> 09:01.463
Freud?

09:06.255 --> 09:07.838
Tell Mr. Wöller.

09:23.172 --> 09:24.797
We have to tell someone.

09:25.630 --> 09:28.255
Who then? And what exactly?

09:30.172 --> 09:32.047
Do you have anything to say?

09:36.297 --> 09:37.713
I think he's here.

09:38.213 --> 09:39.255
Who?

09:40.505 --> 09:41.505
Jonas.

09:42.297 --> 09:44.755
I think Bartosz is right. He's back.

09:45.297 --> 09:48.505
We traveled through time
and that's all that interests you?

09:49.255 --> 09:53.547
You said he's part of it.
Unlike you, he might know what this means.

09:53.630 --> 09:57.047
Maybe he knows where Dad or Mikkel is,
or who knows what!

09:58.588 --> 09:59.880
Magnus is right.

09:59.963 --> 10:01.880
We have to tell someone.

10:03.130 --> 10:05.922
Everyone has been up to
their own shit for months.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.422
Everyone's silent.

10:09.630 --> 10:12.213
What good has that done? None at all.

10:15.755 --> 10:16.755
Okay.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.463
Then we should do it.

10:21.630 --> 10:22.630
We?

10:24.838 --> 10:26.630
There is no "we."

10:30.630 --> 10:32.297
There never has been.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.838
-What does that mean?
-You knew what was going on for months.

10:35.922 --> 10:38.963
You never told me or anyone else here.

10:51.463 --> 10:53.088
Do whatever you want.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.005
<i>I hope it won't take too long.</i>

11:08.297 --> 11:10.088
Helge is still very exhausted.

11:21.338 --> 11:23.005
Do you know this woman?

11:29.255 --> 11:31.255
Answer the sergeant.

11:32.672 --> 11:34.255
Were you with her maybe?

11:37.422 --> 11:39.297
Did she lock you in?

11:43.422 --> 11:45.088
He told me about her.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.422
The White Devil.

11:57.505 --> 11:58.630
Who?

12:00.088 --> 12:01.963
Who told you about her?

12:03.172 --> 12:05.963
The man who did that to you?

12:24.838 --> 12:26.338
The White Devil.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.255
Tell me about

12:35.213 --> 12:36.588
the White Devil.

12:44.047 --> 12:45.797
She wants to kill us.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.422
All of us.

12:51.338 --> 12:54.255
She's dead.
She can't hurt anyone anymore.

12:57.713 --> 13:00.255
But she hasn't even started yet.

13:11.047 --> 13:12.838
-Claudia?
-Hey, Dad.

13:15.422 --> 13:17.630
Shouldn't you be at work?

13:18.338 --> 13:19.922
I took the day off.

13:21.047 --> 13:22.838
Is everything all right?

13:23.338 --> 13:25.255
We discussed you moving in with us.

13:26.088 --> 13:27.172
I...

13:27.588 --> 13:29.047
Already forgotten?

13:29.130 --> 13:31.963
You said I should think it over.

13:35.755 --> 13:37.088
I just thought...

13:38.088 --> 13:39.672
why waste time?

13:41.963 --> 13:43.422
Then you'll be out of here.

13:46.005 --> 13:47.547
I like it here.

13:49.797 --> 13:51.297
I have to go.

13:51.963 --> 13:53.338
To the hospital.

13:54.297 --> 13:55.630
My first chemo.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.838
Can I...

14:03.172 --> 14:04.505
maybe join you?

14:09.338 --> 14:11.505
That is, only if you'd like.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.297
That'd be nice.

14:26.338 --> 14:29.588
What do you want here?
I've already told you everything.

14:30.255 --> 14:31.922
I'd like you to look at something.

14:32.713 --> 14:33.713
Mr. Wöller?

14:39.213 --> 14:40.672
What is it?

14:42.172 --> 14:45.005
A copy of a document
from the Marburg Registry Office.

14:45.713 --> 14:49.255
The info on your last ID
before you left Marburg.

14:51.672 --> 14:53.672
I've no idea how this is relevant.

14:54.172 --> 14:55.505
Nothing stands out?

14:58.922 --> 15:01.297
No. What should stand out?

15:03.505 --> 15:06.297
5' 6", I'd say. Tops.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.213
That document says 5' 8".

15:10.880 --> 15:12.713
So where are they?

15:16.547 --> 15:17.797
Where are what?

15:19.838 --> 15:21.547
The two inches.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.672
This is ridiculous.

15:27.922 --> 15:29.255
I'm arresting you.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.963
On suspicion of identity theft.

15:36.922 --> 15:38.130
You can't.

15:54.338 --> 15:55.630
Hannah?

15:56.505 --> 15:57.713
Hannah?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.255
Anyone home?

16:06.005 --> 16:07.297
Hello?

16:16.963 --> 16:18.130
Hello?

16:20.588 --> 16:23.130
Hannah, if you're home,
please open the door.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.172
Pardon me. I...

16:33.088 --> 16:34.338
Who are you?

16:35.880 --> 16:37.338
Please come in.

16:55.338 --> 16:56.588
I...

16:58.047 --> 17:00.755
I... I wanted to talk to Hannah.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.088
She's not here.

17:07.047 --> 17:08.255
Want a drink?

17:13.547 --> 17:14.963
Do I scare you?

17:16.713 --> 17:18.338
I don't want to.

17:20.047 --> 17:23.547
I think
I'm just having déjà vu or something.

17:23.630 --> 17:25.297
-I'm going.
-A glitch in the matrix.

17:32.630 --> 17:33.838
What?

17:38.713 --> 17:40.755
Or a message from beyond.

17:42.005 --> 17:44.005
You read that somewhere.

17:44.088 --> 17:45.755
How do you know that?

17:56.463 --> 17:57.922
You found the pendant.

18:12.255 --> 18:13.338
Jonas?

18:29.505 --> 18:32.880
Do you think
that I was a good police officer?

18:34.297 --> 18:36.672
Oh, Dad. No idea.

18:38.463 --> 18:41.130
I'm sure you were good at what you did.

18:45.922 --> 18:48.047
Actually, I don't think so.

19:01.922 --> 19:05.255
You were always different.

19:08.338 --> 19:11.838
You saw the world differently
from the very start.

19:20.255 --> 19:22.047
Sometimes I think

19:24.172 --> 19:26.255
that that's my problem.

19:27.255 --> 19:31.255
That I can't see the world as it truly is.

19:34.838 --> 19:38.130
I think I did something very, very stupid.

19:39.755 --> 19:41.338
What do you mean?

19:44.005 --> 19:45.755
Do you know that movie?

19:46.588 --> 19:50.172
The one with the young man
who has this car

19:50.255 --> 19:52.422
that can take him to the past?

19:53.963 --> 19:56.172
I know this sounds crazy,

19:57.338 --> 19:58.588
but...

20:01.547 --> 20:03.172
the stuff in that movie

20:05.505 --> 20:06.838
really exists.

20:08.588 --> 20:10.380
Time travel.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.797
And somehow...

20:17.963 --> 20:23.005
it has all got to do with Mads and Helge.

20:24.422 --> 20:26.213
And with things

20:26.505 --> 20:29.047
that happened over 30 years ago.

20:41.963 --> 20:43.338
Mr. Tiedemann!

20:43.922 --> 20:45.047
Mr. Tiedemann.

20:45.963 --> 20:48.380
A woman's waiting for you in your office.

20:51.005 --> 20:52.797
Did she say what she wanted?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.963
It's about the man in the asylum.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.088
The one who killed the boys.

20:58.255 --> 20:59.838
She says she knows him.

21:04.047 --> 21:05.047
Thanks.

21:23.922 --> 21:25.088
Hello.

21:26.713 --> 21:28.088
Hello.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.672
How can I help you?

21:43.672 --> 21:44.713
I...

21:47.088 --> 21:49.005
I'm looking for my husband.

21:50.713 --> 21:52.297
It was in the paper.

21:53.505 --> 21:55.213
The dead children.

21:57.422 --> 21:58.755
And there was a photo.

22:01.338 --> 22:03.130
I think it's my husband.

22:27.838 --> 22:29.338
Is that your husband?

22:33.463 --> 22:35.463
There's a resemblance.

22:35.547 --> 22:38.963
We looked for relatives.
No one came forward.

22:40.505 --> 22:44.380
You know he was arrested last winter
for multiple murders?

22:48.463 --> 22:49.880
Can I see him?

22:52.213 --> 22:54.088
It's not that simple, he's...

22:55.797 --> 22:58.588
currently in a psychiatric facility.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.922
He won't talk.

23:03.922 --> 23:05.172
I see.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.047
But maybe he'll talk to me.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.755
May I ask you what your name is?

23:23.130 --> 23:24.213
Nielsen.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.338
Katharina Nielsen.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.422
Where were you all this time?

23:53.005 --> 23:55.213
I promised you
I'd make it all right again.

23:59.963 --> 24:01.588
I'm so sorry.

24:22.130 --> 24:23.922
Suddenly it all makes sense.

24:34.963 --> 24:37.047
Once you know, it's obvious.

24:50.213 --> 24:51.463
Hannah?

24:52.755 --> 24:54.463
Hannah, open the door!

24:56.047 --> 24:57.422
Hannah?

24:57.505 --> 24:58.547
Hannah!

24:58.630 --> 24:59.838
Martha, don't.

24:59.922 --> 25:00.963
Please.

25:13.588 --> 25:15.088
Martha?

25:20.338 --> 25:22.922
You know who this is? Hm?

25:23.005 --> 25:25.130
Did he tell you where your brother is?

25:25.213 --> 25:27.047
Who your brother is?

25:29.130 --> 25:30.588
That man

25:30.672 --> 25:32.547
is your brother's son.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.422
My grandson, your nephew.

25:37.630 --> 25:40.047
Mikkel is Michael Kahnwald.
You hear me, Martha?

25:41.130 --> 25:43.422
And you are his aunt.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.005
Martha.

25:52.213 --> 25:53.797
I'm so sorry.

25:56.755 --> 25:58.088
I'm sorry.

25:59.588 --> 26:02.172
I... Believe me, I really wanted to...

26:02.713 --> 26:04.338
Where's your machine?

26:04.922 --> 26:07.172
The one you can travel through time with?

26:09.130 --> 26:10.422
Hannah's got it.

26:11.505 --> 26:12.922
She's vanished.

26:14.547 --> 26:15.630
Hannah?

26:22.422 --> 26:24.547
Tell me how I can get Mikkel back!

26:27.297 --> 26:28.630
Mom...

26:28.713 --> 26:30.463
Magnus has the device.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.838
What?

26:32.380 --> 26:33.963
We traveled with it.

26:35.380 --> 26:37.005
You were there?

26:39.463 --> 26:41.088
Did you see Mikkel?

26:43.130 --> 26:44.422
Mikkel?

26:50.047 --> 26:52.213
Keep your filthy fingers off her.

26:53.005 --> 26:54.297
You got me?

26:56.172 --> 26:57.422
Come on.

28:15.838 --> 28:17.088
What is this?

28:18.213 --> 28:19.380
My brother

28:20.130 --> 28:21.838
also vanished without a trace.

28:22.713 --> 28:24.005
In 1986.

28:27.297 --> 28:29.963
Much like
Mads Nielsen's disappearance here.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.588
Not a trace.

28:35.963 --> 28:37.172
Nothing.

28:38.088 --> 28:39.797
His name was Aleksander too.

28:41.213 --> 28:43.088
Aleksander Köhler.

28:45.255 --> 28:46.672
Just like yours.

28:49.338 --> 28:50.922
A common name.

28:54.713 --> 28:58.588
To be precise, there are
over 700 Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

29:00.047 --> 29:04.838
It isn't all that easy to track down
every Aleksander Köhler.

29:06.047 --> 29:10.713
Particularly when they've assumed
their wife's maiden name.

29:12.005 --> 29:14.005
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.963
When my parents split,
I took my mother's last name.

29:19.922 --> 29:22.380
I went from Köhler to Clausen.

29:24.422 --> 29:27.755
For some people
I'm still untraceable to this day.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.672
But,

29:33.463 --> 29:34.963
a couple of months ago,

29:37.172 --> 29:39.005
this happened.

30:02.172 --> 30:03.588
Read it.

30:03.963 --> 30:05.213
Out loud.

30:20.672 --> 30:22.422
"He that has eyes to see

30:23.213 --> 30:24.922
and ears to hear

30:26.547 --> 30:30.338
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret.

30:32.255 --> 30:34.088
If his lips are silent...

30:34.422 --> 30:37.380
-...he chatters...
-...he chatters with his fingertips.

30:38.422 --> 30:42.880
-Betrayal oozes...
-...out of him at every pore.

30:45.838 --> 30:48.922
You'll find the answers
concerning your brother in Winden.

30:51.255 --> 30:52.547
A friend."

30:54.838 --> 30:56.547
I have no idea

30:57.755 --> 30:59.922
what's going on in this town.

31:07.297 --> 31:09.172
But I'm very certain of one thing.

31:10.005 --> 31:11.380
You...

31:18.047 --> 31:19.922
are definitely not my brother.

31:39.088 --> 31:41.088
Your husband never confessed.

31:42.463 --> 31:44.922
He kept insisting
he wanted to save the children.

31:47.088 --> 31:48.588
You and your husband...

31:50.547 --> 31:52.463
You have children, right?

31:53.172 --> 31:54.172
No.

31:56.505 --> 31:57.713
No.

31:57.797 --> 31:58.922
Strange.

32:01.005 --> 32:03.255
He kept saying he was looking for his son.

32:08.963 --> 32:11.297
This may sound a bit odd, but...

32:13.713 --> 32:16.713
Have you ever heard of a "White Devil"?

32:21.172 --> 32:23.880
No. What is that supposed to be?

32:28.963 --> 32:30.630
If he talks to you...

32:31.255 --> 32:33.672
That is, if he should talk to you,

32:34.422 --> 32:37.088
persuade him to talk to the police.

32:38.922 --> 32:41.463
Persuade him to confess.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.797
And the man came from the future?

32:47.880 --> 32:50.380
Back to 1953?

32:50.463 --> 32:52.130
That's when you arrested him.

32:52.963 --> 32:55.672
And yesterday
that man tried to kidnap the boy?

32:57.255 --> 32:58.338
No.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.713
Not that man.

33:02.172 --> 33:03.297
I mean...

33:04.297 --> 33:05.797
the same man,

33:06.672 --> 33:08.338
but older.

33:08.422 --> 33:10.172
Because he's allegedly his son?

33:13.755 --> 33:15.005
I know.

33:15.713 --> 33:17.672
It all sounds completely insane.

33:18.547 --> 33:19.963
The man,

33:20.047 --> 33:21.338
the old man.

33:24.005 --> 33:25.380
Where is he now?

33:28.963 --> 33:30.755
Back in psychiatric care.

33:33.755 --> 33:35.922
That's enough. You're moving in with us.

33:37.963 --> 33:39.630
We'll get your things now.

33:41.297 --> 33:42.922
So you believe me.

33:50.380 --> 33:51.755
So you...

33:52.422 --> 33:53.880
traveled with it?

33:57.130 --> 33:58.463
To what year?

34:01.380 --> 34:02.922
To what year?

34:10.713 --> 34:12.047
So that's what's going on.

34:13.255 --> 34:15.505
You knew about this time travel shit?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.130
Why didn't you say anything?

34:21.963 --> 34:23.213
Martha.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.713
Yes. At Franziska's.

34:26.755 --> 34:28.338
Yes, I'll be right home.

34:29.047 --> 34:30.338
You what?

34:32.213 --> 34:33.297
Who?

34:42.380 --> 34:43.797
Jonas is back.

34:45.297 --> 34:46.922
Like Bartosz said.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.422
But he's older.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.838
You guys should stay out of this.

35:04.755 --> 35:06.088
Unbelievable.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.547
So you two knew it too.

35:09.422 --> 35:11.922
That's exactly what ruins everything!

35:12.005 --> 35:14.088
All your fucking secrets!

35:14.588 --> 35:18.047
You couldn't even talk to us
when Dad screwed Benni!

35:18.130 --> 35:20.713
What incompetent assholes you are!

35:21.422 --> 35:22.630
Franziska.

35:36.422 --> 35:37.630
<i>K-53.</i>

35:55.255 --> 35:57.588
I'd like a moment alone with him.

35:59.755 --> 36:02.255
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

36:02.338 --> 36:03.630
Please.

36:03.713 --> 36:05.088
Just five minutes.

36:08.338 --> 36:09.630
As you wish.

36:49.588 --> 36:50.713
Ulrich?

37:00.838 --> 37:01.922
Ulrich.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.297
Ulrich, it's me.

37:08.505 --> 37:09.588
Hannah.

37:12.172 --> 37:13.213
Hannah.

37:15.130 --> 37:16.672
Ulrich, it's me.

37:18.380 --> 37:20.005
Is it really you?

37:20.880 --> 37:21.963
Yes.

37:25.088 --> 37:26.755
Or are you an angel?

37:27.963 --> 37:29.463
Are you an angel?

37:38.088 --> 37:39.922
-Is it you?
-Yes.

37:45.338 --> 37:46.922
It's you.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.255
Do you know where Mikkel is?

37:59.838 --> 38:02.255
And Katharina? How is Katharina?

38:02.755 --> 38:04.422
Martha? Magnus?

38:12.963 --> 38:15.713
It's so different seeing you again.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.172
What?

38:23.630 --> 38:25.630
If you could choose today,

38:26.797 --> 38:28.630
between Katharina and me?

38:33.130 --> 38:34.338
What do you mean?

38:35.047 --> 38:36.380
Why?

38:39.713 --> 38:42.588
Back when we were together, you...

38:44.880 --> 38:45.963
I...

38:47.130 --> 38:49.588
I tried to remember if you...

38:49.672 --> 38:51.963
if you ever said "I love you" to me.

38:52.047 --> 38:53.422
I loved you.

38:56.922 --> 38:58.713
I still love you.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.213
Get me out and I'll leave Katharina.

39:07.963 --> 39:09.380
I love you.

39:09.463 --> 39:10.588
Okay?

39:12.213 --> 39:13.797
I love you.

39:15.797 --> 39:17.922
He said I need no one.

39:19.630 --> 39:21.255
But the truth is

39:22.297 --> 39:23.922
you don't need me.

39:24.005 --> 39:26.297
Yes, yes. I need you, Hannah.

39:26.380 --> 39:27.755
I love you.

39:28.838 --> 39:30.588
You've got to get me out.

39:31.963 --> 39:34.380
I'll do anything you want.

39:34.463 --> 39:36.297
Get me out of here, please.

39:36.380 --> 39:38.047
Hannah, I love you.

39:39.213 --> 39:40.463
You hear me?

39:41.755 --> 39:43.130
I love you.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.047
Hannah. Stay!

39:46.130 --> 39:47.505
I love you.

39:47.588 --> 39:50.088
You fucking cunt!

39:50.172 --> 39:52.797
Stay! Stay with me!

39:54.630 --> 39:56.005
Stay with me!

39:56.630 --> 39:58.297
I love you!

39:58.380 --> 40:01.338
She's a liar!

40:02.755 --> 40:05.172
There are similarities, but...

40:05.255 --> 40:06.547
Hannah!

40:07.255 --> 40:08.172
I love you!

40:08.255 --> 40:09.838
That's not my husband.

40:19.297 --> 40:20.547
Get me out of here!

40:21.588 --> 40:23.255
Get me out of here!

40:38.047 --> 40:39.255
Mom?

41:00.213 --> 41:01.797
Everything will be fine.

41:02.797 --> 41:04.088
Okay?

41:11.755 --> 41:13.255
You got the machine?

41:39.213 --> 41:40.963
Do you know how it works?

41:41.630 --> 41:42.880
I...

41:43.547 --> 41:44.838
don't.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.963
Bartosz used it.

42:08.588 --> 42:09.838
They're alive.

42:12.505 --> 42:13.547
Mikkel.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.963
And Dad.

42:16.755 --> 42:17.755
What?

42:18.880 --> 42:20.547
They're just not here.

42:22.130 --> 42:23.922
They're in another time.

42:27.297 --> 42:30.838
Just grab your pills quick.
We'll come back for everything else.

42:30.922 --> 42:33.047
I just need a minute.

42:44.755 --> 42:46.630
Come on. Let's go.

42:49.172 --> 42:50.672
I wonder

42:51.880 --> 42:54.172
why he wanted
to go into the caves with him.

42:57.630 --> 43:00.755
Maybe there's something there,
in the caves.

43:00.838 --> 43:02.005
Dad, stop.

43:13.088 --> 43:15.755
But he wanted to go there in 1953 too.

43:17.630 --> 43:19.130
And again now.

43:20.380 --> 43:23.338
-Maybe there's something--
-There's nothing in the caves.

43:23.422 --> 43:27.505
But there must be some reason
he wanted to go in there.

43:33.672 --> 43:35.047
Can we go now?

43:50.297 --> 43:52.005
Why are you really here?

43:54.213 --> 43:56.047
What do you mean by that?

43:56.838 --> 43:58.338
You know.

43:59.422 --> 44:00.963
What do I know?

44:01.047 --> 44:03.755
You know about the time travel.

44:06.672 --> 44:10.588
-It's related to the nuclear power plant.
-I'd like to go now!

44:14.880 --> 44:17.005
You're involved in all of this.

44:19.255 --> 44:20.755
Don't be ridiculous.

44:23.255 --> 44:25.838
We have to have the caves searched.

44:25.922 --> 44:29.713
There's nothing in the caves!
There is no time travel!

44:47.963 --> 44:51.130
-What are you doing?
-Calling the station.

44:51.213 --> 44:53.255
To have them search the caves.

44:56.255 --> 44:57.672
You're clueless.

44:58.005 --> 45:01.338
What's in the caves eclipses
all scientific discovery.

45:01.422 --> 45:04.880
That substance turns all we know
about the universe on its head.

45:05.380 --> 45:08.963
And you want to risk all of that?
For nothing?

45:11.963 --> 45:14.172
You haven't changed.

45:18.755 --> 45:21.713
It's still all about you.

45:23.963 --> 45:25.880
You have no heart.

45:29.922 --> 45:31.338
Let go.

45:31.422 --> 45:32.422
Let go!

45:42.088 --> 45:43.588
Oh God, Dad!

45:45.463 --> 45:46.922
Stay right there.

45:49.130 --> 45:50.380
Don't move.

45:51.588 --> 45:52.672
I...

45:54.380 --> 45:55.963
I'll call an ambulance.

46:05.213 --> 46:06.463
Come on.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.422
Come on!

46:10.505 --> 46:13.088
<i>Winden Emergency Services,</i>
<i>how can I help?</i>

46:14.547 --> 46:15.755
<i>Hello?</i>

46:16.672 --> 46:17.672
<i>Hell--</i>

46:35.838 --> 46:37.880
"You'll have to make sacrifices."

46:40.588 --> 46:43.005
"Everything will happen as it always has."

46:43.963 --> 46:46.422
"But if everything goes right,
she'll live."

46:47.713 --> 46:48.963
Regina.

47:10.255 --> 47:11.922
I'm so sorry.

47:17.797 --> 47:21.047
You are the White Devil.

47:50.338 --> 47:52.422
You're sure he wasn't your husband?

48:01.838 --> 48:03.172
I...

48:03.838 --> 48:05.380
should've reacted quicker.

48:08.630 --> 48:11.338
-I'm sorry.
-Don't blame yourself.

48:16.463 --> 48:17.755
Nielsen...

48:19.380 --> 48:20.797
That's an...

48:22.088 --> 48:23.588
uncommon name.

48:23.672 --> 48:25.672
Do you know an Agnes Nielsen?

48:26.588 --> 48:27.713
No.

48:34.088 --> 48:36.547
You're traveling back today?

48:41.338 --> 48:43.422
I lost everything where I came from.

48:46.172 --> 48:48.130
All I want is a fresh start.

51:36.463 --> 51:42.422
SLEEPING OVER AT A FRIEND'S, R.

53:01.630 --> 53:03.047
Who are you?

53:03.880 --> 53:05.630
Why do you have a key to my house?

53:06.547 --> 53:09.088
You gave it to me before you left.

53:10.380 --> 53:11.630
Nonsense.

53:13.338 --> 53:14.588
I don't even know you.

53:26.380 --> 53:28.088
She gave it to you.

53:30.463 --> 53:31.630
My older self.

53:34.130 --> 53:37.297
We've got to go.
We don't have much time.

53:37.880 --> 53:38.963
I don't understand.

53:52.463 --> 53:54.713
I know what you did.

53:57.630 --> 53:59.255
She told me.

54:12.672 --> 54:16.088
But she also said
it didn't have to happen that way again.

54:20.005 --> 54:21.297
Next time.
