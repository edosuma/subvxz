00:01.302 --> 00:03.302
<i> Previously on "nashville"...</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:04.670
New boyfriend?
Yeah.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.373
It might be time for y'all to
sign at highway 65.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.307
Maddie: The only reason
she signed us

00:08.309 --> 00:10.309
Is to keep me
under her control.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.043
Get of off her!
Dad! Dad!

00:11.045 --> 00:13.178
She's 16 years old!

00:13.180 --> 00:16.648
I promise you I will be
your dream client from now on.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.450
Are you asking me
to go on the road with you?

00:18.452 --> 00:20.452
What do you say?

00:20.454 --> 00:21.854
My band and I are gonna
have a drink in my room.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.355
Come join us.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.157
What would you think about
coming out of retirement

00:25.159 --> 00:26.125
And going on the road
with me?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.292
He packed a bag and he left.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.094
I don't know
where he is.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.164
What do you mean
you don't know where riff is?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.633
Well, he -- he said
he was going up to our
cabin for a few days

00:34.635 --> 00:36.902
Before leaving with you,
but I checked.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.070
He was never there.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.875
I'm relaunching my tour
with his name on the ticket

00:42.877 --> 00:45.210
In less than 24 hours,
and you're telling me

00:45.212 --> 00:47.579
He's just gone,
not a word?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.181
I tried calling,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.016
But the only time
he ever answered,

00:51.018 --> 00:52.918
He said he'd be home
when he was good and ready.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.355
I don't know
what else to do.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.223
[ sighs ] damn it.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.225
Rayna:
Well, I hear ya, babe,

01:00.227 --> 01:02.094
And I'm -- I'm hoping
we're gonna get out of here

01:02.096 --> 01:03.195
Before this storm hits.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.764
And we'll just handle it
together, okay?

01:05.766 --> 01:08.233
I love you, too.
Bye.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.234
Everything okay?

01:09.236 --> 01:11.103
Apparently
deacon caught maddie

01:11.105 --> 01:12.371
Playing at some club

01:12.373 --> 01:13.672
Where she didn't have
permission to be.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.240
Mm. You worried?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.910
I'm sure...
This is gonna be okay.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.581
You know,
I-I probably shouldn't.
Oh, come on.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.217
It'll help ease
the prerelease jitters.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.618
I mean,
if -- if I'm this nervous

01:26.620 --> 01:28.420
About the single
dropping tomorrow,

01:28.422 --> 01:30.255
I-I think, uh, the whole album
might kill me.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.590
[ both laugh ]

01:31.592 --> 01:32.791
Well,
between you and me,

01:32.793 --> 01:34.460
I have a feeling the exes
are gonna be just fine.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.561
[ glasses clink ]
cheers.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.628
Cheers.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.766
I want to hear more about
your music, though.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.401
I mean, you won a cma.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.236
For songwriting, um,

01:44.238 --> 01:46.438
But performing's always been
my -- my passion.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.241
Oh, I can tell.
I've watched you play.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.144
You've got this sort of

01:52.146 --> 01:55.414
Old-soul,
james taylor thing going on.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.050
I mean, he's a --
he's a huge inspiration.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.052
Well,
I'll be sure to tell him.

02:00.054 --> 02:02.154
James is my neighbor
in new york.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.155
What?
Mm-hmm.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.656
[ chuckles ]
in fact,

02:04.658 --> 02:06.492
I'm headed there
tomorrow after the show

02:06.494 --> 02:08.393
While the tour shuts down
for a few days.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.229
You're more than welcome
to join me

02:10.231 --> 02:11.730
If you want to tell him
yourself.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.633
Oh, I mean,
that would be in--

02:14.635 --> 02:15.634
In-- uh, incredible.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.935
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.103
Scarlett would love to come,
too.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.304
[ chuckles ]

02:19.306 --> 02:21.306
I was actually thinking
maybe just the two of us.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.610
Oh.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.911
Right.
[ chuckles ]

02:25.913 --> 02:27.679
You know,
I got this, uh --

02:27.681 --> 02:30.616
This radio thingy in the morning
for the single,

02:30.618 --> 02:31.750
And, uh, I should --

02:31.752 --> 02:33.452
I should really
call it a night.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.287
Yeah?
[ sighs ] yeah.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.656
Well, you just let me know
about tomorrow.
Uh-huh.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.158
I-I-I will do that.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.492
Uh, g-good night.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.529
¶¶

02:43.531 --> 02:46.098
And...Voilà.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.333
Enjoy.
Juliette, you didn't
have to do all this.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.002
Oh, it's nothing.
Please.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.803
I just wanted to say
thank you.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.973
And since we're all here,
I'd like to talk about,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.175
What do you think
our next steps will be?

02:56.177 --> 02:57.376
Next steps?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.945
Yes,
for resurrecting my career.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.947
Are you sure you're ready?
You saw me last night
at the opry.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.615
It was amazing.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.217
I think it'd be stupid
for us to lose that momentum.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.285
All right,
but what about cadence?

03:06.287 --> 03:08.187
I thought you wanted
to stay close for her.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.222
I'm not talking about touring
the australian outback here.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.124
I'm talking about
starting my next album.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.959
And that way, I can spend
as much time with the baby

03:13.961 --> 03:15.394
As avery will let me

03:15.396 --> 03:17.362
And keep some semblance
of a career alive.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.330
Have you talked to your
label head about any of this?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.898
I thought that's why
I had a manager.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.033
Oh.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.802
Can you set up a meeting?
Here's the thing.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.404
Uh, luke's getting ready
to go on tour tonight,

03:25.406 --> 03:26.538
But I'll --
I'll do the best I can.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.240
Okay, well,
you work on that.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.008
Emily,
you just keep doing

03:30.010 --> 03:31.343
Whatever it is
I pay you to do.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.477
Mm-hmm.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.214
It's great to have
the team back, huh?

03:35.216 --> 03:36.315
Oh, hey, listen.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.683
If you're serious
about this recording,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.685
We should probably look into
lining up a producer.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.653
I already have
somebody in mind.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.057
Morning.
[ groans ]

03:45.059 --> 03:46.758
What's up with you?
Late night?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.660
Oh, thank you.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.363
Yeah, I, uh -- I kind of maybe
spent all night

03:51.365 --> 03:53.165
Looking into
online dating.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.101
What?

03:56.103 --> 03:59.905
Working with kevin yesterday
got me...

03:59.907 --> 04:02.007
Got me feeling like
maybe it's time to move on.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.276
Eh, well, got to start
somewhere.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.411
Any potential suitors?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.613
Mnh, no.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.514
All these sites and apps
are all about hooking up.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.416
I'd like to try going out
with somebody, you know?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.552
Though I have no idea
how to do that.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.088
'least you and gunnar
won't be around to mock me

04:16.090 --> 04:17.756
While I figure it out.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.291
Yeah,
I hate to disappoint you,

04:19.293 --> 04:21.193
But I don't think
I'm going on layla's tour.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.427
How come?
It's a steady gig.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.029
It's --
it's a chance to play.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.897
It's exactly
what you've been looking for.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.399
It's not that simple.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.734
I mean, I-I have cadence
to think about.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.636
And, plus,
juliette just got back,

04:30.638 --> 04:31.970
And they're making
really good progress.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.240
So you're staying
for juliette?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.075
No. No.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.478
I just don't think
now's a good time, is all.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.651
[ beep ]
yeah, riff,
it's me -- again.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.085
Look, man,
I don't know where you are

04:47.087 --> 04:48.220
Or what the hell's
gotten into you,

04:48.222 --> 04:50.989
But, um,
you got heidi worried sick,

04:50.991 --> 04:52.824
And I ain't that far behind.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.227
Look, sound check's
in six hours, all right?

04:55.229 --> 04:56.595
I'll see ya there.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.397
Any luck?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.766
Do I look like a guy
who's had much luck lately?

05:00.768 --> 05:01.800
No. Nothing yet.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.335
Luke, we're --
we're sold out.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.304
I mean, not just tonight,
but the rest of the tour.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.139
It could sink us
if he misses the first show.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.807
Yeah, thanks for
pointing out the obvious, ken.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.175
Trust me,
last thing I want to do

05:10.177 --> 05:12.778
Is face all of nashville
with another apology.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.746
What do you want to do?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.682
What I want to do is believe
riff's still my friend

05:16.684 --> 05:18.183
And he'll come through.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.586
But maybe we ought to find
a replacement for tonight

05:21.588 --> 05:22.988
Just in case.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.793
Layla, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.
That's okay.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.094
Uh, I already ordered,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.295
But if you know what you want,
I can get the waitress.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.196
Oh, no, I'm stuffed.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.031
My meeting with juliette
this morning

05:33.033 --> 05:34.366
Turned into
a breakfast buffet.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.368
You met with juliette?
Yeah, I did.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.703
Oh, and you should
probably know

05:37.705 --> 05:39.171
That I'm gonna be
representing her again.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.706
What?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.307
Look, just because
I'm managing you both

05:42.309 --> 05:43.842
Does not mean
you're gonna have to

05:43.844 --> 05:46.144
Compete for my attention,
okay?
[ scoffs ]

05:46.146 --> 05:48.513
She's more concerned about
staying home nowadays.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.383
And right now,
my priority is you

05:51.385 --> 05:52.984
And your big debut
on luke's tour tonight.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.488
And to mark the occasion,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.190
Bucky and I arranged
to have your show filmed.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.825
Great.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.827
So the camera crew will meet you
at sound check

06:01.829 --> 06:03.562
To go over the details.
Okay.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.063
Everything you need
for an amazing launch.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.998
Well, almost.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.501
I might still need
a bandleader.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.337
[ whispering ] sorry.
She's not ready yet.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.306
I didn't want
to waste a nap.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.642
[ whispering ] you know what?
I can hold her while
you pack her things.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.578
Yeah?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.546
Yeah.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.588
Okay. [ sighs ]

06:38.198 --> 06:40.432
So, I'm, uh, starting
my new album.

06:40.434 --> 06:44.436
What do you think about
producing a couple tracks on it?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.605
I'm -- I'm going on tour
with layla...

06:48.275 --> 06:50.542
...As her bandleader

06:50.544 --> 06:51.610
Starting tonight.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.213
Oh.
So...

06:55.215 --> 06:57.582
I'm gonna go
get her carrier.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.555
[ exhales sharply ]

07:03.557 --> 07:05.257
Nothing like traveling
all night.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.292
Sorry, babe. I got here
as fast as I could.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.593
I know.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.696
Mm. You seen her yet
this morning?
No.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.865
I'm the last person
maddie wants to talk to.
Mm.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.600
I figured I'd give her
a little space.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.469
Glad you caught her,
though.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.037
Yeah,
but she's not the problem.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.572
I'll tell you what the problem
is -- cash, all right?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.374
I'm serious. We got to keep her
away from our daughter.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.775
Really?
Seriously, yeah.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.577
If we have to get a restraining
order, let's do it.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.446
I thought cash
was helping maddie.
I know.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.047
I thought she was
a good influence,

07:29.049 --> 07:30.715
But I'm telling you,
she's not, all right?

07:30.717 --> 07:32.317
If you'd seen
the way maddie was singing,

07:32.319 --> 07:34.052
If you'd seen the<i> song,</i>
it was just --

07:34.054 --> 07:35.720
It wasn't
our little girl, baby.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.056
Well, I'm gonna
go get that little girl up,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.025
Have a little conversation
with her.
All right.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.401
Maddie, honey,
can I come in?

07:51.972 --> 07:55.740
Maddie? Maddie?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.176
Maddie? Maddie?!

08:02.483 --> 08:06.318
¶¶

08:13.093 --> 08:15.961
I think this is everything.
Great.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.263
Thank you.
Yeah.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.365

This your idea?
Yeah.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.558
Well, as soon as you said yes,
I had them put it in

25:27.560 --> 25:29.293
So we can keep recording
on the road.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.194
And...

25:33.633 --> 25:34.899
I had them put in a crib
for cadence

25:34.901 --> 25:36.033
So you won't
have to worry about

25:36.035 --> 25:37.434
Cramming into a bunk
or anything.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.004
Wait.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.473
You're giving me
your bedroom?
Yeah.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.975
I can't imagine it's gonna be
easy touring with an infant,

25:44.977 --> 25:46.744
So you should be
comfortable.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.348
What's wrong?

25:51.350 --> 25:53.484
Uh...

25:53.486 --> 25:55.052
I just need a second.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.825
So, apparently, this wasn't
just any record deal.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.861
Sony was offering you
the works --

26:03.863 --> 26:06.931
A huge advance, big marketing,
massive royalties.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.532
They basically
wanted to make you

26:08.534 --> 26:10.067
The next taylor
or miranda.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.870
Wow. Only my mom would kill
an opportunity that good.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.238
It's not dead.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.541
Sony's still interested
if you are.
Really?

26:17.543 --> 26:19.243

26:19.245 --> 26:22.379
But I'm -- I'm still under
that contract with highway 65.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.114
I mean, even if my parents
would let me go,

26:24.116 --> 26:26.517
I would still need their consent
to sign with sony.

26:26.519 --> 26:29.620
It's like no matter where I go,
they're just in my way.

26:29.622 --> 26:30.621
Yeah, listen.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.392
On that call,

26:35.394 --> 26:37.661

that I think you should know.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.865
Okay.
Well, thanks, valerie.
[ deacon sighs ]

26:41.867 --> 26:43.267

and what's
the lawyer say?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.372
Well, she says basically

26:48.374 --> 26:50.207
We just need to keep doing
what we're doing.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.142
[ scoffs ]
you know, calling people
and searching.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.445
Great.
That's real, real helpful.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.913
The only other option
is we get the police involved.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.815
Then,
why don't we do that?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.249
Because as soon as
the police are involved,

26:59.251 --> 27:00.317
We got to file a report,

27:00.319 --> 27:02.286
And then she's in the system
as a runaway.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.621
Well, she<i> is</i> a runaway,
rayna.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.289
But, hon, the minute
that she's in the system,

27:05.291 --> 27:07.057
Suddenly anybody
can get ahold of that.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.459
I mean,
that's public knowledge.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.060
That can be dragged
through the tabloids.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.462
I don't want that for her.
All right, great.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.763
We can't do this.
We can't do that.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.765

I don't know!

same as you are.

Good lord, deacon.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.438
Why'd you have to blow up on her
like that last night?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.741
You have no idea what it was
like in there, rayna!

27:23.743 --> 27:24.908
All right?!
What was I supposed to say?!

27:24.910 --> 27:26.276
"excuse me, young man.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.544
When you're done
groping my daughter's leg,

27:27.545 --> 27:28.811
Can I have a little word
with you over here?"

27:28.814 --> 27:31.515
What was I
supposed to do?!
I don't know.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.317
But I do know what it is
to be a 16-year-old girl

27:33.319 --> 27:35.352
And have a fight with
your father and leave
the house forever.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.888
And I don't want that
for maddie.

end like that

on the road --

The parties, the groupies.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.863
You must remember.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.665
Yeah, I do. I just --

28:21.667 --> 28:24.068
I guess I thought those days
were behind him.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.202
Me too.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.573
You know, it eventually got so
bad I had to put my foot down.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.475
I made him retire.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.678
Figured it was the only way
to save him, save us,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.246
And it stuck for a while.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.416
At least, I thought it did.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.152
Truth is, after he played
the beverly last week,

28:42.154 --> 28:43.987
He never came home.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.756
Hell,
I am so sorry, heidi.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.925
I never would've
brought him back out

Had I known the temptation
would be too --
it is not your fault.

It's like an addiction
to him.

our family,

You saw perfection.
