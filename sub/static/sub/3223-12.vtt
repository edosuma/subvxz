00:03.040 --> 00:07.090
Dad wants us to pick up where
he left off. Saving people, hunting things.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.090
The family business.
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.849
It's a bloodline.
It's in your blood, your father's blood...

00:15.040 --> 00:16.565
...your family's blood.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.883
- I like that John kid.
- You do?

00:20.120 --> 00:21.326
You two are meant to be.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.363
The union of John and Mary
Winchester.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.722
Very big deal upstairs.
Priority arrangement.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.803
Are you saying
you fixed up our parents?

00:28.040 --> 00:31.169
The orders were very clear.
You and Sam needed to be born.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.488
Your parents were just meant to be.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.007
This book.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.646
This is Dad's single-most
valuable possession.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.446
Everything he knows
about every evil thing is in here...

00:41.680 --> 00:43.330
...and he's passed it on to us.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.649
How many people do you think
Dad saved?

00:51.840 --> 00:54.605
That's his legacy.
So we gotta keep going.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.289
Hey, sport. Sorry about that.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.047
- Where you going?
- Work.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.447
Just wanted to check on you
before I left.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.170
What's that, Pops?

01:36.440 --> 01:39.683
One day, I'll tell you all about it.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.771
Now get some shuteye.
I'll see you first thing in the morning.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.843
Good night, son.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.442
Good evening, sir.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.249
Josie. No one told me this initiation
was a formal affair.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.006
Well, someone had to class up the joint,
right, Henry?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.964
Ain't that the truth.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.810
The hard part's over, right?
We made it.

03:01.760 --> 03:02.841
Miss Sands?

03:45.240 --> 03:48.130
Henry, do not let Abbadon get it.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.681
That's impossible. How...?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.641
Which of you is John Winchester?

05:22.360 --> 05:24.840
Please. Time is of the essence.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.408
- Which of you is John Winchester?
- Neither.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.284
That's impossible.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.325
That's absolutely...
What did I do wrong?

05:34.560 --> 05:37.689
- Who the hell are you, mister?
- Not now, I'm thinking.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.720
Please, I can assure you,
there's no need for violence.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.211
- One of you must know John Winchester.
- Tell you what.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.008
When one of us falls out of your closet,
then you can ask the questions.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.924
Yes. My apologies.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.449
Is it absolutely essential, sir,
that you keep your hands on me?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.330
Thank you.

06:02.440 --> 06:07.128
Gentlemen, in the absence of
any and all other explanations...

06:07.320 --> 06:12.963
...I'm afraid this has been a marvelous,
tragic misunderstanding.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.247
I'll be on my way.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.011
- Not happening.
- There are things of grave importance.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.124
I do not have time to deal
with the likes of you.

06:20.320 --> 06:24.450
You're not going anywhere, 007,
till we get some answers.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.891
How did he do that?
You gotta be kidding me.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.331
2013?

06:56.920 --> 06:58.729
My God.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.961
Guess the Mayans were wrong.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.527
Nice taste in wheels.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.241
Yours, I presume?

07:28.120 --> 07:30.088
And there with the holy water.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.809
He's clean.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.649
I could have told you that.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.807
Well, you can start by telling us
everything before I beat it out of you.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.082
I'm quite certain this is all beyond
your understanding...

07:44.280 --> 07:46.965
...my alpha-male, monkey friend.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.323
And violence will not help
you comprehend this any easier.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.366
Let me tell you what I understand,
some asshat pops out of my closet...

07:54.560 --> 07:57.131
...asking about my dad,
smashes up my ride.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.890
So why am I not getting violent?

07:59.120 --> 08:01.521
John Winchester is your father?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.049
What is that?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.850
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.929
Run.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.044
Henry.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.647
Heh, heh. Silly man.
You forgot to lock the door.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.411
Then spells never were
your best subject, were they?

08:30.720 --> 08:34.691
Why don't you be a doll and give me what
I want and I promise to kill you quickly?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.724
- You know I can't do that.
- You're not a fighter, Henry.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.207
Josie, I know you're still in there.
You must fight this.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.323
I'm afraid Josie's indisposed, pet.
It looks like it's just you and me.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.009
Well, that is no way to treat a lady.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.969
Go. Go, go, go.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.765
Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.047
You okay, lady?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.646
What the hell you doing?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.691
Show me what you've seen.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.444
Thank you.
By the way, I'm checking out.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.603
Are you okay?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.411
Yes, I will be.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.722
It's just all the adventures I enjoy
are usually of the literary nature.

10:30.920 --> 10:35.244
Now that you're done blowing chunks,
wanna tell us who Betty Crocker was?

10:35.720 --> 10:38.041
Abbadon. She's a demon.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.248
No kidding.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.171
- Where'd she come from?
- Where'd you come from?

10:43.480 --> 10:44.561
She's from hell.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.446
I'm from Normal, Illinois, 1958.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.565
Yeah, right.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.366
Seriously?

10:57.080 --> 10:59.845
Time traveling through closets?
That's what we've come to?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.281
If you take me to John,
we could clear this up.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.130
- I'm sure.
- That's not gonna happen.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.368
- Why not?
- Because he's dead.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.767
No.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.088
Well, what's it to you?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.807
Everything.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.569
I'm his father.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.521
Driver's license says he's
Henry Winchester from Normal, Illinois.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.128
He knows Dad's birthday,
the exact place where he was born.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.365
Dude, that's our grandfather.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.648
Before we break out
the warm and toasties...

11:54.840 --> 11:58.811
...let's not forget H.G. Wells over there
left Dad high and dry when he was a kid.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.162
Maybe he didn't run out on Dad.
Not on purpose.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.768
Maybe he time traveled here
and, I don't know, got stuck.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.208
Either way,
Dad hated the son of a bitch.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.688
And Dad made up for that how?
By being Father of the Year?

12:12.680 --> 12:14.409
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.045
You're welcome.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.325
Look, Dad had his issues, okay?
But he was always there for us.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.046
I freaking hate time travel, man.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.809
How you doing?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.929
I'll be fine.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.170
After all, despite everything...

12:34.200 --> 12:37.204
...I've just met my grandsons,
haven't I?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.406
Henry Winchester.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.049
- It's a pleasure.
- Sam.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.681
Hello, Sam.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.327
Dinner.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.726
This is Dean.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.367
Right.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.928
This has been touching. How about
we figure how to clean up your mess?

12:56.120 --> 12:58.248
Abbadon.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.245
Yes. She must be stopped.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.681
And how come she didn't die
when I stabbed her?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.730
Because demons can't be killed
by run-of-the-mill cutlery.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.646
At the very least you'd need an ancient
demon-killing knife of the Kurds.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.726
That's what this is.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.367
Where'd you get that?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.083
Demon gave it to me. We've been around
this block so many times.

13:20.280 --> 13:24.285
Now, that portal, or whatever it was
you came through, is it still open?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.525
I highly doubt it. Why?

13:27.720 --> 13:30.200
I'm just thinking,
if we can't kill this Abbadon...

13:30.400 --> 13:33.688
Maybe we could shove her back where
she came from. How did you do it?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.882
It's a blood sigil.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.728
Blood leads to blood.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.446
Or their next of kin.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.167
But Abbadon came through it also,
right?

13:44.360 --> 13:47.045
So can you create
this blood sigil again?

13:47.240 --> 13:49.242
With my blood...

13:49.440 --> 13:52.922
...an angel feather, tears of a dragon,
a pinch of the Sands of Time.

13:53.120 --> 13:57.125
I would need those and at least a week
for my soul to recharge.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.731
But, yes, it's possible.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.244
You tapped the power of your soul
to get here?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.448
I thought only angels can do that.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.688
You should know this.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.969
- What level are you two?
- What level?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.405
Level of knowledge.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.047
You're Men of Letters, correct?

14:18.800 --> 14:22.691
Ahem. I'm a little rusty on my boy bands.
Men of what?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.842
Men of Letters.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.170
Like your father,
who taught you our ways.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.762
Our father taught us
how to be hunters.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.007
You're not, are you? Hunters?

14:39.480 --> 14:41.448
Well, hunters are...

14:41.800 --> 14:43.290
Hunters are apes.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.168
You're supposed to... You're legacies.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.089
Legacies of what?

15:04.040 --> 15:06.202
What's going on here?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.041
No.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.249
All right. Well, this was enlightening.
Let's hit the road, huh?

15:17.440 --> 15:20.046
- Give him a minute, Dean.
- We spent four hours driving.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.642
All he did was stare out the window
and request Pat Boone. He had time.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.251
It's just a facade.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.565
A way to rook our enemies
into believing we are housed elsewhere.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.847
Okay. Enough with the decoder talk.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.409
Tell us what this whole Men of Letters
business is or you're on your own.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.843
- It's none of your concern.
- Why? Because we're hunters?

15:41.080 --> 15:45.165
- What do you have against us?
- Aside from the unthinking, unwashed...

15:45.360 --> 15:49.081
...shoot first and don't bother to ask
questions later part, not much, really.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.284
Wait a second.
We're also John's children.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.964
You're more than that, actually.

15:58.680 --> 16:02.810
My father, and his father before him,
were both Men of Letters...

16:05.240 --> 16:07.083
...as John and you two
should have been.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.441
We're preceptors, beholders...

16:13.640 --> 16:17.645
...chroniclers of all that
which man does not understand.

16:17.840 --> 16:23.961
We share our findings
with a few trusted hunters, the very elite.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.966
They do the rest.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.362
So you're like the Yodas to our Jedis?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.565
Never mind. You'll get there.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.929
Okay, but if you guys were such
a big deal, then why haven't we...

16:37.120 --> 16:40.283
...or anyone we know,
ever heard of you?

16:40.640 --> 16:41.687
Abbadon.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.091
Henry, Why? Why'd she do it?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.127
I think for this.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.361
- Okay. What's that?
- I wish I knew.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.369
Abbadon attacked us
the night of my final initiation.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.643
- All secrets were to be revealed then.
- Let me get this straight.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.481
You traveled through time to protect
something that does you don't know...

17:09.680 --> 17:12.650
...from a demon
that you know nothing about?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.040
Good.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.282
Hand me your walkie-talkie.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.010
- You mean my phone?
- Even better.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.967
Operator, I need Delta 457.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.087
Who are you not calling?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.442
Our emergency number.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.211
Yeah. Not anymore.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.845
They can't all be gone.
There must be another elder out there...

17:57.040 --> 18:01.523
...who can help us figure out how to stop
Abbadon and what to do with the box.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.363
Hey. Hi. Can we hijack
your computer for a hot second?

18:05.600 --> 18:10.083
Ha, ha. Like you could fit a computer
in this room.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.562
- Sure.
- Thanks.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.688
- Sam.
- Yeah.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.370
All right. Ahem. Give me a name.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.246
Anybody who might have been there
that night. One of those elders.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.568
Ackers, David. Larry Ganem.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.488
- Ted...
- Okay, here it is.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.682
"August 12th, 1958.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.403
Tragic fire at gentleman's club,
242 Gaines Street."

18:37.600 --> 18:41.685
This is 242 Gaines Street.
But that was no fire.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.201
Larry Ganem, David Ackers,
Ted Bowen and Albert Magnus.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.925
All deceased.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.246
Albert Magnus.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.768
- He a friend of yours?
- Even better.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.244
These were my friends, my mentors.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.967
Our last defense against
the Abbadons of the world.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.563
Well, there's your buddy,
Albert Magnus.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.727
Albertus Magnus.
And he was hardly a buddy.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.965
He was the greatest alchemist
of the Middle Ages.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.651
Okay. So why is he buried here?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.884
He's not.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.041
His was the alias we'd use
when going incognito.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.449
I believe someone planted his name
in that article...

19:38.640 --> 19:40.881
...so that if a Man of Letters
came looking...

19:41.080 --> 19:43.242
...he'd know something was amiss.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.963
So someone wanted
you to come to this grave?

19:47.680 --> 19:48.727
The question is why.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.122
- What is this?
- Our crest.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.287
The Aquarian Star.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.960
Representing great magical power.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.482
They say it stood at the gates
of Atlantis itself.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.651
It's on all the tombstones
except for this one, Larry Ganem.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.646
The Haitian symbol for speaking
to the dead.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.610
This is the message.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.846
You boys ever exhume a body?

20:37.520 --> 20:40.046
Love what you've done with the place.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.766
Huh.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.084
Wrong night.
Carrie screening is on Sunday.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.121
I dig your costume, though.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.564
What are you doing?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.282
Show me what you've seen.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.845
Can we hijack your computer?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.361
- Give me a name.
- Ackers, David. Larry Ganem.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.891
- A tragic fire.
- No fire.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.650
- Albert Magnus.
- Thanks.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.561
Please don't hurt me.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.606
I like your top.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.604
You gonna tell me
how we got stuck doing this?

21:45.960 --> 21:49.442
Hey, was Larry a World War I vet?

21:50.160 --> 21:53.289
- No.
- Well, then who's the stiff?

21:54.160 --> 21:55.207
No idea.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.167
Captain Thomas J. Carey Ill

22:06.160 --> 22:07.400
That mean anything to you?

22:09.120 --> 22:14.126
Well, somebody wanted you to see this,
so maybe that somebody is Larry.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.850
So, what, maybe he survives
the attack...

22:18.040 --> 22:21.123
...and then hides out
with this guy's identity?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.489
Okay.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.924
What are we waiting for, then?

22:26.760 --> 22:29.491
Cover this up. Let's be on our way.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.165
What is that? I know that tune.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.888
"As Time Goes By."

22:47.200 --> 22:48.770
I hope so. It's from Casablanca.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.882
Right. Dad used to whistle it
from time to time.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.560
Your father saw
Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy...

22:58.760 --> 23:00.330
...at the drive-in one night.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.690
It scared the beeswax out of him.

23:04.040 --> 23:06.850
So I got him this little music box
that played that song...

23:07.040 --> 23:09.088
...to help him sleep at night.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.970
Worked like a charm.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.371
Wow.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.410
It's hard to believe
Dad was ever scared of anything.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.491
Hey, according to county records,
Tom Carey...

23:21.680 --> 23:26.925
...lives in Lebanon, Kansas,
and is a very happy 127-year-old.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.240
Say we get some shuteye,
head over in the morning.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.124
Wait, wait, wait. Listen to this.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.687
According to Dad's journal,
he tortured a demon...

23:37.880 --> 23:40.121
...said he made his bones
working for Abbadon.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.211
Who, turns out, is a knight of hell.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.206
What does that even mean?

23:47.560 --> 23:50.245
Knights of hell are handpicked
by Lucifer himself.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.163
They are of the first-fallen,
firstborn demons.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.169
So very pure, very strong.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.083
Legend has it that
archangels had killed all of them.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.250
Which, as we have witnessed,
is not the case.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.322
Unless she's the last of her kind.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.683
- You say that belonged to your father?
- Yeah.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.446
May I?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.164
It's a hunter's journal.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.921
I assume, Men of Letters,
you used journals too?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.648
I intended to.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.450
I sent away for one
the day before my initiation.

24:33.880 --> 24:37.202
As a matter of fact,
judging by my initials here...

24:37.600 --> 24:38.806
...this one, I believe.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.126
That was yours?

24:42.320 --> 24:44.288
It must have arrived after...

24:49.280 --> 24:52.443
I'm beginning to gather
I don't make it back from this time, do I?

24:53.800 --> 24:56.371
We don't know for sure.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.606
What we do know is
that Dad never saw you again.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.970
What did he think happened to me?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.486
He thought you ran out on him.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.722
John was a legacy.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.526
I was supposed to teach him
the ways of the Letters.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.087
Well, he learned things
a little differently.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.244
- How?
- The hard way.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.526
Surviving a lonely childhood,
a stinking war...

25:26.800 --> 25:30.725
...only to get married and to have
his wife taken by a demon...

25:33.080 --> 25:35.367
...and later killed by one himself.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.688
That man got a bum rap
around every turn...

25:41.200 --> 25:44.647
...but you know what? He kept going.

25:45.200 --> 25:49.046
And in the end, he did a hell of a lot
more good than he did bad.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.845
I'm sorry. I wish I had been there
for him.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.771
Yeah, it's a little late for that now,
don't you think?

26:00.920 --> 26:04.481
There's a price we pay for upholding
great responsibility. We know that.

26:04.680 --> 26:10.881
Your responsibility was to your family,
not some glorified book club.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.050
I was a legacy. I had no choice.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.447
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.651
- Hey, wake up.
- What, what?

27:12.840 --> 27:16.208
- Henry. He's gone.
- Where is he?

27:16.440 --> 27:19.808
I have no idea. He just left a note
saying he was gonna fix everything.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.480
Yeah, or screw it all up.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.205
All right.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.762
Welcome, traveler.
What can I help you with?

27:40.960 --> 27:43.884
I can use a tear of a dragon
and a pinch of the Sands of Time.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.765
Don't bother wrapping it up.
I'll be using it right away.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.362
We don't carry those things here.
Can I interest you in some kava root?

27:50.600 --> 27:55.242
- It's great for anxiety.
- In your window, hunter signs.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.767
I know who you are and what you are.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.282
Now give me what I need
so I can be on my way.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.290
I agree.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.847
You should be going, stranger.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.443
I understand.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.849
You don't know me,
so you're reluctant to sell to me.

28:12.800 --> 28:13.926
Fine.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.842
But please let me purchase
some chamomile...

28:17.040 --> 28:19.884
...for my restless nights before I go.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.244
Sleep well.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.526
Now we know what he meant
by "fix everything."

28:33.720 --> 28:34.926
What?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.849
He stole an angel feather.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.441
He's gonna whip up
one of those blood spells...

28:39.640 --> 28:41.563
...Marty McFly himself
back to the 1950s.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.807
To do what?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.810
- Stop Abbadon before she strikes?
- Or grab Dad and haul ass?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.923
- Look, point is, he's doing it.
- But how?

28:48.160 --> 28:51.369
He still needs two other ingredients
for the spell. Unless...

28:51.560 --> 28:54.803
Unless there's someplace nearby
that sells real hoodoo.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.929
I'll call Garth.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.369
All units, possible
homicide at Astro Comics. Location...

29:00.560 --> 29:03.928
Hey. Just hit the wires.
One dead at Astro Comics.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.361
- Abbadon?
- Yeah. Has to be.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.005
Okay, so she's close.

29:08.200 --> 29:12.330
I'll go find Henry, you find Larry,
figure out how to kill this chick.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.487
So Henry is dead?

29:26.440 --> 29:30.365
I was so sure that he had survived.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.564
Yes. Well, like I said,
I found his journal...

29:33.760 --> 29:36.730
...and was hoping you could fill in
the gaps...

29:36.960 --> 29:39.964
...and explain to me
what happened that night in 1958.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.370
Doesn't matter. They're gone.
We're gone.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.087
- But Abbadon is not.
- Abbadon was a hired gun.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.766
She killed us all that one night.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.051
Everyone but you.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.084
She blinded me.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.884
It's a miracle I survived.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.208
It's okay, dear.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.406
But she did not get what she came for.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.009
The box.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.291
Listen. Abbadon is here,
and she wants this thing...

30:14.480 --> 30:18.166
...so I need to know everything
there is to know about it.

30:18.800 --> 30:25.604
In the box is the key
to every object, scroll, spell...

30:25.840 --> 30:30.402
...ever collected in a thousand years,
under one roof.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.846
It is the supernatural mother lode.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.971
Henry, wait.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.927
This is a risk I have to take.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.681
And what if you die, huh?
Who said you'll even survive the jump?

30:50.880 --> 30:55.204
You cannot begin to understand
how I felt after reading John's journal.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.846
Oh, I think I can.
I've read that thing more times...

30:58.080 --> 31:00.560
...than you can imagine.
And it hurts every time.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.366
Maybe so. But you didn't let him down,
I did.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.449
- Just like you said.
- Well, I was wrong.

31:05.640 --> 31:09.087
No. No, you were right.
And I'm going to go back...

31:09.280 --> 31:12.170
...and give him the life he deserves,
not the one he lived.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.488
- What if it's not meant to be?
- It will be.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.644
- How can you be so sure?
- Because it's the right thing to do.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.129
- I can save him and stop Abbadon.
- How?

31:22.320 --> 31:25.483
By going back an hour before
she attacks and making preparations.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.969
If you do that, then you change the past.
Me and Sam might cease to exist.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.243
I'm aware that time is
a delicate mistress...

31:33.440 --> 31:35.886
...but I'm willing to bet on this being
for the best.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.885
I understand that this is not your idea
of a happy ending.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.408
And you're disappointed that me
and Sam are mouth-breathing hunters...

31:42.600 --> 31:45.251
...but you know what?
We stopped the apocalypse.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.284
If this works the way I planned...

31:48.480 --> 31:51.245
...there will never be
an apocalypse to stop.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.201
So Abbadon wants the key
so she can get her hands on it.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.291
Can you imagine
what she would do with that?

32:03.520 --> 32:05.568
How do we stop her?
How do we stop Abbadon?

32:05.760 --> 32:07.842
You don't.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.563
If you know where the key is.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.091
Then take it to these coordinates.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.564
Throw it in.

32:23.160 --> 32:27.370
Shut the door forever and walk away.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.766
Wait. Why would I do that?

32:30.960 --> 32:37.047
Because it is the safest place on earth,
warded against any evil ever created.

32:37.240 --> 32:42.167
It is impervious to any entry
except the key.

32:42.560 --> 32:47.726
Right, but then all that knowledge
would be lost and gone forever.

32:47.920 --> 32:54.087
And that is the price we have to pay
for keeping it away from Abbadon.

32:54.320 --> 33:00.202
You do have the key, don't you?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.769
I don't.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.444
But my brother...

33:09.000 --> 33:10.490
My brother does.

33:12.120 --> 33:16.170
How rude.
You haven't finished your tea, Sam.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.881
Abbadon.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.171
The years have not been kind, Larry.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.011
Sammy.

33:30.360 --> 33:34.922
Ha, ha.
No. Much sexier. Try again.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.609
- Abbadon.
- Good boy.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.485
Listen up, I wanna make
a good, old-fashion horse trade.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.604
Henry and the key for your brother...

33:45.120 --> 33:46.326
...or he dies.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.165
- Am I clear?
- Crystal.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.291
On the road to Larry's,
there's a processing plant.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.642
Don't keep me waiting.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.405
Abbadon has Sam?

34:01.320 --> 34:03.721
She wants to trade you and the key
for Sam's life.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.202
If I could just go back,
stop this all from happening.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.487
And what if you can't?

34:10.320 --> 34:12.641
I can't take that risk.
Not with Sam on the hook.

34:12.840 --> 34:16.242
I can't abandon my son, Dean.
Not again.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.283
I need to do this. I'm sorry.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.844
Well, I'm sorry too.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.524
Sorry about that.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.081
No, you're not.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.527
You've wanted to do that
since we met.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.406
Henry, you need to understand
something.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.170
When my dad died,
I couldn't save him.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.201
No matter how bad I wanted to.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.889
I never want that to happen to Sam.
Even

35:11.200 --> 35:13.726
If there's a chance
that I can save him...

35:15.040 --> 35:16.485
...I'm gonna do it.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.931
He's my brother.
He's the only family I got.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.287
- Don't do it, Dean.
- Too late for that now.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.410
That's the problem with you hunters,
you're all shortsighted.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.967
Yeah, at least we're not extinct
Abbadon!

35:42.080 --> 35:45.243
I'll send Henry here over with the box.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.445
You do the same with Sam.
No tricks.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.371
My only interest is Henry and the key.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.445
You two are free to go.

35:58.320 --> 36:02.962
You can do this standing
or you can do it crawling. Your call.

36:12.160 --> 36:16.131
- Henry, I'm sorry.
- Save it.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.162
- Don't do this, Dean. This is a bad idea.
- Shut your mouth. Let's go.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.205
Come on.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.527
We had a deal.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.361
Ha-ha-ha! Surprise. I lied.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.004
- Henry!
- Wait, wait.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.571
You're not the only one.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.284
I'm gonna do it. He's my brother.
He's the only family I got.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.445
- So, what are you thinking?
- Can you slow Abbadon down?

36:57.640 --> 37:00.211
Because if you can, I'll do the rest.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.848
Whoo. What a blast.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.530
Now give me the box.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.286
Where is it?

37:17.040 --> 37:20.840
Okay, we can do this the hard way.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.084
Why am I stuck?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.968
A devil's trap carved into the bullet?

37:45.320 --> 37:48.927
You're gonna have to get close.
And close means it could get ugly.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.845
I know. But you do that for blood.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.085
Heh-heh. You still didn't kill me.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.087
No, but you'll wish we did.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.207
That demon trap in your noggin
is gonna keep you from smoking out.

38:07.400 --> 38:11.450
We're gonna cut you into little steaks
and bury each strip under cement.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.967
You might not be dead
but you'll wish you were.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.601
We did it.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.610
No, you did it.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.280
And for a bookworm, that wasn't bad,
Henry.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.602
I'm sorry I judged you two so harshly
for being hunters.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.604
I should have known better.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.487
About?

38:43.680 --> 38:46.160
You're also Winchesters.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.489
And as long as we're alive,
there's always hope.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.211
I didn't know my son as a man...

39:00.240 --> 39:02.686
...but having met you two...

39:04.440 --> 39:07.011
...I know I would have been proud
of him.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.603
I get it now.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.920
Hm?

39:52.040 --> 39:54.122
What Cupid said...

39:54.560 --> 39:57.325
...about heaven busting ass
to get Mom and Dad together.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.930
Winchesters and the Campbells...

40:01.360 --> 40:03.408
...the brains and the brawn.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.123
I'm glad you see it.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.051
All I see in our family tree
is a whole lot of dead.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.251
Hey, I found this in Henry's wallet.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.965
Dad looks happy.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.401
Kind of makes you wish
he knew the truth, huh?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.890
I mean, all those years thinking
his old man ditched...

40:35.080 --> 40:38.607
...when the poor son of a bitch
really came here and saved our bacon.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.121
Freaking time travel, man.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.928
You think it would have made
a difference?

40:46.120 --> 40:47.849
What?

40:49.120 --> 40:53.125
Dad, if he'd had his own father around.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.645
What, in how he raised us?

40:58.760 --> 41:02.401
- Sammy, he did the best he could.
- I know that. I do.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.130
They all did.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.491
What are the chances
that place is still standing?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.769
A chance we gotta take, I guess.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.805
I mean, we are legacies, right?
