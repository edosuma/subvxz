00:05.100 --> 00:09.490
I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.190
Darling, I never thought
I'd find love again.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.590
I not only found it, but i
found the love of my life.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.090
To evelyn.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.290
***

00:20.300 --> 00:23.290
That poor, clueless bastard.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.590
Like watching a dog
stick his face in a fan.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.990
You don't do that more than once.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.490
I am the lucky one in this relationship.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.190
And I promise you, darling,

00:37.200 --> 00:42.390
I am going to be the
best wife I possibly can.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.590
To teddy.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.290
to teddy.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.290
That poor, clueless bastard.

00:49.200 --> 00:49.990
So can we go now?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.390
No, we can't; it would be rude.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.190
I don't mind being rude.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.390
You just talking or you got a plan?

00:55.400 --> 00:58.290
Well, if I eat enough shrimp,
I can make myself puke.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.790
Then start eating.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.890
All right, stop it, both of
you.There'll be no puking--

01:01.900 --> 01:04.290
we're going to stay,
congratulate the happy couple,

01:04.300 --> 01:07.790
mingle a bit and then I'm
going to fake a migraine.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.690
You can do that?

01:08.700 --> 01:09.490
Hell yeah.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.590
I spent 12 years watching my
wife fake migraines and orgasms.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.390
I'd go with the migraine.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.790
Thanks for coming, fellas.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.290
Means a lot to me.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.390
Wouldn't miss it.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.990
We wish you a lifetime of love
and happiness.Right, charlie?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.990
Well, yeah, but he seems
hell bent on marrying mom.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.290
Hey, d...

01:30.300 --> 01:31.790
, sorry I'm late.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.490
That's okay, doodlebug.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.090
I'm just glad you could make it.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.390
charlie, alan, jake, this
is my daughter courtney.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.190
Honey, these are evelyn's
sons and grandson.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.890
I'm the grandson.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.090
Ah, well, it's nice to
finally meet you all.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.090
Nice to meet you, too.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.590
So, teddy, what's the deal?

01:50.600 --> 01:54.090
All this time you've been hiding
this beautiful woman from us?

01:54.100 --> 01:57.090
Just from you, charlie.

01:57.100 --> 01:57.990
Fair enough.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.190
Dad's a little overprotective.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.890
I can see why.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.990
Charlie, why don't you
and i get courtney a drink.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.490
I'd like to get courtney a house.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.789
Walk with me.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.790
How's your headache, dad?

02:11.800 --> 02:14.590
Not yet--
so...

02:15.100 --> 02:17.490
courtney, y-you have amazing posture.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.490
Do you see a chiropractor?

02:19.500 --> 02:20.490
No.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.890
Would you like to?

02:22.900 --> 02:24.590
Charlie I need you to do me a favor.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.790
Anything for you, teddy, name it.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.290
Stay away from courtney.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.390
Name something else.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.390
Charlie, this is import...

02:31.400 --> 02:32.490
don't worry.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.290
I think too much of you to want to,

02:34.300 --> 02:38.190
you know, do what I want
to do with your daughter.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.390
I appreciate that.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.890
Consider it a wedding present.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.090
Thanks.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.790
No seriously, that's all you get.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.990
Oh, courtney dear, what
a surprise to see you.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.290
Well, I told you I was coming.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.690
Yes, but the party started an hour ago,

02:52.700 --> 02:55.390
so I just naturally assumed
that something had come up

02:55.400 --> 02:59.290
that was more important
than your father's happiness.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.190
well, evelyn, you know what
they say about assuming.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.590
When you assume...

03:03.600 --> 03:06.490
you're just a bitch.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.490
Courtney, there are children present.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.290
She means me, but I'm fine with it.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.490
Thank you, dear.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.190
You should hear what
they call her at home.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.890
- Have some shrimp.
- Oh, boy.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.190
Well, great party, but we got to go.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.490
Oh, already?

03:23.500 --> 03:26.490
Yeah, we'd love to stay,
but alan's got a headache.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.890
Not yet.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.190
Not yet...

03:30.200 --> 03:32.390
debilitating, but I do need to lay down.

03:32.400 --> 03:37.390
Hey, uh, before you go, my dad had
mentioned that you like nice cars.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.990
- Yeah.
- I do, too.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.590
Swell.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.290
Here's my card.Maybe I
can help you out someday.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.690
Whoa.Ferraris?Lamborghinis?

03:46.700 --> 03:50.590
They say driving one is the most
fun you can have with your pants on.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.590
Well...that's how i like
to drive, with my pants on.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.190
Otherwise the leather kind
of sticks to my thighs.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.190
well, you should come down sometime.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.890
I'll give you a test drive.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.890
Actually, I'm really not a ferrari guy.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.490
I'm not, either.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.290
Bye-bye.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.890
We really got to get
our signals straight.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.790
I mean, you just made me look stupid.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.589
Don't blame your father for that.

04:18.200 --> 04:23.090
I'm telling you right now, I'm
not having any more children.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.390
Terrific.

hello.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.590
No, it's alan.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.190
Oh.Oh, hi, courtney.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.890
Well, it was very nice
meeting you last night too.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.390
Oh.Oh, I'm sorry.

05:09.400 --> 05:14.490
I had no idea that you were planning on
using a fake migraine to get out early.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.990
So, uh, so what did you do?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.990
Ooh, menstrual cramps.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.690
Yeah, I can't get away with that.

05:23.700 --> 05:28.790
Although sometimes, I'll use
irritable bowel syndrome, and...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.190
okay, I'll get charlie.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.290
It's teddy's daughter;
she wants to talk to you.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.090
Really?

05:36.100 --> 05:37.990
But you promised teddy
you'd stay away from her.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.790
Hey, I didn't tell her to call me.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.790
What kind of man would hit
on his future stepsister?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.990
You're just making it hotter for him.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.490
Give me the phone.Give me the phone.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.890
Hi, courtney, what's up?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.190
that's nice, but I told you
I'm really not into ferraris.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.490
A bentley?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.890
Well, that's a little more my style.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.390
Okay, I guess I could come
by and take a peek at it.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.690
First a peek, then a poke.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.790
Uncalled for.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.590
2:00?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.690
Great, I'll see you then.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.490
I swear, this is just business.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.290
I'm going to look at a
bentley she got in on trade.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.290
I can get it for dealer cost.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.990
Since when do you need a bentley?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.790
Nobody needs a bentley, alan.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.890
Just like nobody needs to
date a woman half their age.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.590
But if you want one, it
doesn't hurt to have the other.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.990
Did teddy tell you to stay
away from his daughter, too?

06:51.000 --> 06:51.890
No.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.190
Yeah, why would he?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.490
pretty hot, isn't it?

07:08.100 --> 07:09.590
Oh, yeah, but it'S...

07:09.600 --> 07:10.990
it's not really my thing.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.990
Gee, I think a guy like you would
look pretty great in one of these.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.790
- You think?
- Absolutely.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.990
Here.Slide on into it.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.590
See how it feels.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.690
What about the bentley?

07:23.700 --> 07:25.690
I got the guys in back
washing it up for you.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.590
We have a few minutes.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.490
Ah, sure.Why not?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.190
That's always been my motto.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.890
Oh, pretty snug.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.390
Tight's good, don't you think?

07:43.700 --> 07:46.090
sure, tight's good.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.190
Oh, hi.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.490
Hi.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.890
So, where do they put the
engine in these things?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.490
They put it where it belongs...

07:57.500 --> 07:59.990
in the rear.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.790
So, no stick?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.290
No, you shift from the wheel.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.790
Let me show you.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.290
Left side down, right side up.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.590
You don't need a stick.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.890
And yet I've got one anyway.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.490
is that your cell phone?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.690
Boy, I hope so.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.789
Excuse me.

08:34.799 --> 08:35.990
Hello.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.789
Oh, hey, hey, teddy.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.990
How are ya?

08:41.900 --> 08:45.390
Good.Me?I'm-I'm-I'm
fine.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.490
Just running some errands.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.090
Yeah, I'll be around tomorrow.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.090
Dr-drop by any time.

08:52.100 --> 08:52.890
Great.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.990
I'll see you then.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.190
th-that was your dad.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.590
He wants to talk to me
and alan about something.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.990
I heard.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.090
Has he ever said anything about me?

09:05.100 --> 09:06.690
You?

09:06.700 --> 09:08.190
Uh, let me think.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.490
He told you to stay
away from me, didn't he?

09:10.500 --> 09:14.090
Oh, yeah, there was that.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.490
I can't believe he's still
trying to control my life.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.690
Hey, your dad loves you.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.490
He's just trying to protect you from...

09:20.500 --> 09:24.290
well, in this case, me.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.890
I'm a big girl, charlie.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.090
I can take care of myself.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.590
I'm sure you can.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.790
I can also take care of
whoever I choose to be with.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.890
I'm sure you can.

09:43.500 --> 09:48.790
Listen, uh, i appreciate the
offer, but I think I'm gonna pass...

09:48.800 --> 09:52.090
on the bentley.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.390
But you haven't even seen it yet.

09:54.400 --> 10:00.390
And right now, it's all wet
and soapy, just waiting for you.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.990
Are we still talking about a car?

10:11.800 --> 10:14.090
What do you think?

10:14.100 --> 10:18.390
I think I should probably get
out before I set off the air bag.

10:22.500 --> 10:28.290
and then, she leaned over real
close to play with the "paddles.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.090
" The what?

10:30.100 --> 10:31.990
Paddle shifters on the steering wheel.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.190
Oh, oh.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.790
I had another picture entirely.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.290
But I restrained myself.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.590
I walked away, and now I can
still look teddy in the eye.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.990
That'S...that's great,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.490
but how come you have no
problem looking me in the eye

10:48.500 --> 10:50.290
after sleeping with my wife's sister,

10:50.300 --> 10:55.190
my son's teacher, my divorce
lawyer and my old receptionist?

10:55.200 --> 10:58.790
I like teddy.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.090
And the receptionist was your fault.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.890
How?

11:03.900 --> 11:08.090
If you'd paid her a decent salary,
she wouldn't have had to hook.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.790
I brought the bentley.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.590
Come on, courtney, I told you I can'T.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.290
Just one little test drive.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.090
What do you have to lose?

11:22.100 --> 11:26.190
Well, there's my integrity, my self
respect, my relationship with your father...

11:26.200 --> 11:29.190
give me the damn keys.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.290
***stillin bed with his sister?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.490
Stepsister.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.290
To be.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.490
And yes.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.690
Wow, how long has it been?

11:51.700 --> 11:54.090
About 18 hours.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.790
Good thing he's got supplies up there.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.990
- He does?
- Sure.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.790
Water, powerbars, fresh batteries, rope.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.890
Oh, like, uh, like an earthquake kit.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.790
I guess you could use
that stuff for earthquakes.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.790
oh, crap.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.290
Misdirected anger.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.390
You'll get used to it.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.990
What are you guys doing here?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.990
We came here to talk
with you and charlie.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.890
Didn't he tell you?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.290
No, he did not.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.690
In fact, he never tells me anything.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.490
I don't know half of what
he does, nor do I want to.

12:37.500 --> 12:41.090
It's his life and he alone should
suffer the consequences.Come on in.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.190
Is he even home?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.590
Uh, I'll check.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.990
Why don't you make yourselves
comfortable and, uh...

12:50.000 --> 12:53.390
I'll check.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.490
'Cause I have no idea.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.890
So...

12:57.900 --> 13:01.190
I'll need to check.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.390
Is he on something?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.990
Oh, if only.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.590
What?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.590
Teddy and mom are downstairs.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.490
You're kidding.What the
hell are they doing here?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.790
Apparently, you invited them.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.790
I did not.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.690
Yes, you did.

13:22.700 --> 13:23.790
On the phone, remember?

13:23.800 --> 13:24.790
- Hey, alan.
- Hey, courtney.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.590
How you doing?Charlie, they're waiting.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.390
Yeah, we've got a problem here.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.990
No, no, no, sir, you've got a problem.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.790
I made no promise, I broke no promise.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.090
You actually made a promise?

13:34.100 --> 13:36.690
Yeah.And I really tried to keep it.

13:36.700 --> 13:40.890
He did.I could sense his inner conflict as we
were doing it in the backseat of the bentley.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.090
Okay, look, just stall them.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.190
I'll be right down.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.090
Fine, but know this, charlie.I
am not taking the fall for you.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.290
How could you take the fall for me?

13:51.300 --> 13:57.590
I don't know, but it always seems to work
out that when you get laid, I get screwed.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.890
Just go.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.490
Great.Just great.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.290
Hey, have you seen my dress?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.390
Why?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.090
Well, I ain't going down like this.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.790
You're not going down at all.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.390
Why not?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.690
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

14:14.700 --> 14:19.690
Here.Hit rewind, I'm sure
you'll find something.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.290
I just can't believe he's still in bed.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.090
He's a drunk, mom.That's what they do.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.490
Oh, come on, evelyn,
give the kid a break.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.490
He was probably out late last
night sowing some wild oats.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.990
He's 40 years old.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.090
He was no more wild oats, just
warmed over cream of wheat.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.690
Hey, hey.

14:40.700 --> 14:41.890
Look who's here.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.790
Well, thanks for interrupting
your stupor and joining us.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.090
Oh, I can get back
to my stupor any time.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.790
So, what's going on?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.190
Well, your mother and i wanted
to talk to you about the wedding.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.790
You've got my blessing.What else?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.290
De wonwered if you would
mind having the ceremony here.

14:56.300 --> 15:01.190
Sure, terrific-- on the deck, in here, on
the beach, wherever you want-- what else?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.590
Don't you want to think about it?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.490
Who wants to think
about it?It's perfect.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.090
Have the ceremony, the reception...

15:06.100 --> 15:08.490
hell, alan and i will clear out and you
can use this place for your honeymoon.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.390
Trust me, it's all broken in.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.090
The house, not mom.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.290
do you have one of your
little pop tarts up there?

15:22.300 --> 15:24.290
No, no.Just my alarm.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.490
If I'm not up by 4:00 in the afternoon,
I feel like I've wasted the whole day.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.490
Be right back.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.090
what do you think you're doing?

15:36.100 --> 15:37.490
I'm bored.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.490
You're bored?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.290
Yeah, I want to go downstairs.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.390
No, no, no.No, no.You
can't go downstairs.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.790
Find something else to do.

15:43.800 --> 15:48.490
Well, I'd love to sell you a car.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.690
, yeahvery funny.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.890
no, I'm serious.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.290
You want to sell me a car now?

15:56.300 --> 15:57.790
Or I could...

15:57.800 --> 15:59.690
go downstairs.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.590
You wouldn'T.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.590
I would.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.590
Wait a minute.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.790
You planned this.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.890
You knew they were coming over today.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.590
Well, a good salesman pays attention.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.690
Now, if you'll excuse me...

16:13.700 --> 16:16.390
okay, okay, okay, you win.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.690
Give me a price on the bentley.

16:17.700 --> 16:22.190
Actually, the bentley's no longer
available.I'm thinking the ferrari.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.790
I don't want a ferrari.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.490
***

16:25.500 --> 16:27.490
***

16:27.500 --> 16:29.190
Coming!

16:29.200 --> 16:31.690
Okay, fine.

16:31.700 --> 16:36.290
But let me just say, this
is no way to treat family.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.490
Here we go, blue eyes.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.290
I made it myself.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.190
Ah, thank you.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.390
Nothing for me, thanks.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.990
I don't recall offering.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.890
Sorry, sorry.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.490
So, wedding on the beach.Great.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.590
I'll take care of
everything.Thanks for stopping by.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.990
Well, there is one more thing.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.090
Name it.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.590
- Well...
- excuse me.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.090
Uh, berta, this is a family matter.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.690
If you only knew.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.290
Here's the deal.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.089
I've never had any sons of
my own.Just the one daughter.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.990
And she's great.Isn't she great, alan?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.490
Well, I hardly met her.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.490
Me neither, but I'm sure she's great.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.990
She's terrific.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.589
But, uh, I've grown very
fond of the two of you

17:23.599 --> 17:28.290
and I'd like to ask you to stand
up with me when I marry your mother.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.590
Wow, uh, teddy, that's,
that's quite an honor.

17:31.600 --> 17:36.290
Yeah, uh, I'm really touched.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.990
snooze button.I must have hit
the snooze button.Excuse me.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.490
I don't use the snooze button.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.890
When I'm up, I'm up.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.890
Of course, I'm not a drunk.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.790
are you out of your mind?

17:59.800 --> 18:03.490
I prefer to think of
myself as a "go-getter.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.490
" All right, now you're gonna
want to sign here, here, here

18:05.500 --> 18:08.190
and initial where the little flags are.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.290
This is twice as much as the
bentley.I can't afford t ts.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.490
Well, if you need help
with the down payment,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.490
I'm sure I could ask
my dad to help you out.

18:16.500 --> 18:21.690
He really loves you.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.890
Fine.

18:25.900 --> 18:31.290
Here.And here.And
here.And here.And here.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.390
What's this?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.690
Oh, that's the extended warranty.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.290
Just a little extra protection.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.090
I think it's a bit late for that.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.390
Congratulations.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.590
You now own a ferrari.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.090
Yippee.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.690
Uh, charlie?

18:47.700 --> 18:50.090
What now?

18:50.100 --> 18:52.990
I'm gonna need a check.

18:58.200 --> 19:03.290
You know...this is the most
I've ever spent for sex.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.790
But not by much.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.990
***

19:15.000 --> 19:17.090
Charlie, the wedding
isn't for six months.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.090
Yeah, but it's bad luck to
see the bride beforehand.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.390
Well, thanks again, fellas.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.690
You being part of this
shindig means a lot to me.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.190
Our pleasure, teddy.Bye-bye.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.090
Congratulations.Once again
you get off scott free.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.190
Free?You think that was free?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.690
- Uh, charlie?
- Yeah-yeah!Hi.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.690
I just wanted you to know,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.890
I'm not going to say anything to
your mother about you and courtney--

19:39.900 --> 19:40.990
they don't get along.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.990
Okay, great.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.390
Wait, wait, wait.You
knew?How did you know?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.790
Well, I just noticed the car
outside with her dealer plates on it.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.490
You couldn't have noticed
that on the way in?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.590
How much did she take you for?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.790
Don't ask.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.890
Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.590
Wait, wait, wait.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.590
So you were trying to protect me?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.890
Hey, you're a good kid.

20:04.900 --> 20:10.590
And courtney, well, I love her,
but she is kind of a sociopath.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.890
Bye now.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.590
You know what this means, don't you?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.690
What?

20:18.700 --> 20:21.090
I'm gonna need an eight-car garage.
