WEBVTT

00:03.317 --> 00:05.580
Kidnapping is
such a tricky business.

00:08.488 --> 00:12.754
You're gonna let a slime
like Scarlett go? Knowing
he's committed a murder?

00:12.826 --> 00:14.657
Smith, that is my daughter.

00:14.728 --> 00:17.196
You turn this guy's key
and l'm back on the street.

00:20.734 --> 00:22.702
(B.A.)
You guys knocked me out
and flew me to Italy.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.862
My friends and l are going to
try and get you out of here.

00:24.938 --> 00:26.235
(Crane)
Where does he
think he's going?

00:26.306 --> 00:30.208
(Decker)
Who knows? Smith hasn't had
traction for years.

00:30.277 --> 00:32.575
l don't believe it.
You're me!

00:32.646 --> 00:34.307
You never looked this good.

00:34.381 --> 00:37.248
(Face)
Hey, B.A., slow down!
No, no flying!

00:40.854 --> 00:42.287
(B.A.)
I like it.

00:42.356 --> 00:45.189
Yeah! Is everybody
having a good time?

00:45.258 --> 00:46.850
Of course.
Of course.

00:46.927 --> 00:48.121
How do l look?

00:48.195 --> 00:50.493
You look smashing.

00:52.332 --> 00:54.596
Drop your weapons, now!

00:54.668 --> 00:56.431
(Decker)
I don't believe this.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.403
(Hannibal)
Let's get out of here!

01:03.276 --> 01:05.801
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

01:05.879 --> 01:07.642
was sent to prison
by a military court...

01:07.714 --> 01:09.272
for a crime
they didn't commit.

01:09.349 --> 01:10.509
These men promptly escaped...

01:10.584 --> 01:12.051
from a maximum-security
stockade...

01:12.119 --> 01:13.848
to the Los Angeles
underground.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.512
Today, still wanted
by the government...

01:15.589 --> 01:17.454
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

01:17.524 --> 01:20.118
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

01:20.193 --> 01:21.251
and if you can find them...

01:21.328 --> 01:23.660
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

[door opening]

03:07.000 --> 03:08.592
Hey.

03:21.982 --> 03:24.246
(Del)
How are you doing, Joe?
How am l doing, Del?

03:24.951 --> 03:26.350
l don't know. You tell me.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.820
Well, l think
we're in good shape.

03:29.489 --> 03:32.617
The judge has my writ
and l don't think
they have a chance.

03:32.692 --> 03:36.150
You think this Judge Mordente
cares about my rights
being violated?

03:41.001 --> 03:43.162
You think this guy gives
a toot from next Tuesday...

03:43.236 --> 03:44.999
about whether or not
l understood my rights?

03:45.071 --> 03:47.938
They got Joe Scarlett, Del.
Do you understand that?

03:48.008 --> 03:49.339
They're holding
a big potato...

03:49.409 --> 03:51.377
and they're not gonna let me
drop through the bottom...

03:51.444 --> 03:53.708
because of some legal-beagle
action you might think up.

03:54.114 --> 03:55.138
[sighing]

03:55.215 --> 03:58.184
ls Nicky handling
that matter or what?

03:59.052 --> 04:02.544
Joe, concern yourself
about the legal proceedings.

04:03.623 --> 04:06.751
l could get disbarred
for even discussing--
This is Joe.

04:07.294 --> 04:09.421
The guy who got you
through the bar exam.

04:09.729 --> 04:13.597
You're not a bad lawyer
when the other side is
not thinking too straight.

04:13.667 --> 04:17.603
The only way l'm out of this
is that judge tossing
the case out.

04:17.671 --> 04:21.971
And the only chance of that
is by twisting his tube
of toothpaste so bad...

04:22.041 --> 04:23.771
he's got no choice.

04:23.944 --> 04:27.038
Now, is Nicky on that,
or what?
Yeah.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.045
Then everything is
going to be all right.

04:30.116 --> 04:32.016
Joe, look...

04:33.420 --> 04:37.322
your brother's
coming from ltaly.
What? How?

04:38.291 --> 04:40.623
Come on, Joe,
it's been
in all the papers.

04:40.694 --> 04:43.128
Call him.
Tell him not to bother.

04:43.229 --> 04:45.754
He's already left.
He's on his way.

04:47.667 --> 04:51.398
All rise for
the honorable
Judge Leonard Mordente.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.800
[door closing]

04:56.776 --> 04:59.836
l want Nicky on this now.
He's on it.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.676
l want this taken care of
before my brother
gets here, capiche?

05:03.750 --> 05:06.617
You turn this guy's key
and l'm back on the street.

06:33.473 --> 06:35.236
(woman)
Question,
counsel for defense:

06:35.308 --> 06:37.606
''Did Mr. Scarlett
display any abusive behavior

06:37.677 --> 06:39.406
''when you conducted
the search of his home?''

06:39.479 --> 06:43.108
Answer, Officer Bowman:
''Well, no, sir, not exactly.''

07:06.806 --> 07:08.103
l...

07:10.310 --> 07:13.302
l need to be excused
for a personal matter.

07:13.446 --> 07:15.607
Court will be adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

07:15.682 --> 07:16.671
[gavel bangs]

07:16.783 --> 07:17.875
(bailiff)
All rise.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.223
l'm glad my brother's coming.

07:35.301 --> 07:37.895
Give him a chance to show him
how we do things in America.

07:38.138 --> 07:39.196
[door closing]

07:59.392 --> 08:00.484
[elevator bell dinging]

08:25.785 --> 08:26.809
[grunting]

08:26.886 --> 08:29.081
Oh, no. Look--
Howdy, Judge.

08:30.023 --> 08:32.753
[grunting]
Come on. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

08:34.059 --> 08:37.154
l'm Hannibal Smith,
The A-Team.
Smith? l don't--

08:37.230 --> 08:40.097
l know.
You're afraid of heights.
Mr. Lee mentioned that.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.428
You must be the real thing...

08:41.501 --> 08:44.095
to come all the way up here
to get your daughter back.
Here.

08:45.371 --> 08:48.033
Buckle that up.
lt will make you feel
a lot better.

08:48.107 --> 08:49.938
Then you know that
Joe Scarlett took her.

08:50.009 --> 08:52.534
And you're gonna declare him
not guilty...

08:52.745 --> 08:54.713
even if the jury says he is.

08:54.781 --> 08:57.545
How long has that jury
been deliberating?
Almost two days.

08:57.617 --> 09:00.017
They could come back with
a verdict anytime now.

09:00.086 --> 09:03.055
And what do you think?
Almost definitely guilty.

09:03.122 --> 09:06.853
lf l'm reading them correctly,
and l'm pretty good at
guessing the outcome.

09:06.926 --> 09:08.325
What are you gonna do, Judge?

09:08.394 --> 09:11.158
Are you gonna let a slime
like Scarlett go...

09:11.231 --> 09:13.096
knowing he's committed
a murder?

09:14.234 --> 09:16.031
Smith, that is my daughter.

09:16.102 --> 09:20.266
l can always get a mistrial
declared later, once she's
been returned safely.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.365
lf she's returned safely.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.304
[tires screeching]

09:25.945 --> 09:27.537
[sirens wailing]

09:32.619 --> 09:33.608
(Hannibal)
Uh-oh!

09:37.423 --> 09:38.822
Hang on, Judge.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.557
Hi, guys.

09:49.102 --> 09:50.592
Where does he think
he's going?

09:50.670 --> 09:52.638
Captain, there's no way
off that building.

09:52.705 --> 09:53.797
Let's go.

09:58.444 --> 10:00.435
(Hannibal)
You have any idea
where they're holding her?

10:00.513 --> 10:01.673
(Mordente)
No, no.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.648
l just make them send me proof
that she's still alive.

10:03.716 --> 10:07.675
Every week they send
someone with some proof,
a photograph...

10:07.754 --> 10:09.312
with something current in it.
Yeah?

10:09.389 --> 10:11.983
When do you see
the guy next time?
Tonight.

10:12.058 --> 10:15.084
Since we expect a verdict
any minute, they want to
keep me ready.

10:18.598 --> 10:19.587
[grunting]

10:22.502 --> 10:23.992
[phone ringing]

10:28.441 --> 10:31.433
Are you gonna help me?
Can you find my daughter?

10:31.511 --> 10:34.605
Well, we don't have
much to go on, you know.

10:35.148 --> 10:37.207
And you're a very hot item,
Judge Mordente.

10:37.283 --> 10:40.150
l mean, a judge digging
through the files,
looking for the A-Team.

10:40.219 --> 10:42.016
The military's been
all over you.

10:42.088 --> 10:44.454
l mean, l don't think you're
a bird dog intentionally.

10:44.524 --> 10:46.719
But they've been behind you
every step of the way.

10:57.136 --> 10:59.764
Come on, we'll catch them
on the roof. Move out.

10:59.872 --> 11:01.999
(Decker)
Move out, Captain.
Move out!

11:02.809 --> 11:05.710
Now, give me a hand, Judge.
What are you doing?
What is this?

11:05.778 --> 11:07.405
Tools of the trade, Judge.

11:14.053 --> 11:18.217
Just stay at home, Judge,
wait for their contact.
l'll be in touch.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.156
Hi, guys.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.996
l don't believe this.

12:32.065 --> 12:33.464
[phone ringing]

12:40.106 --> 12:41.198
At the tone...

12:41.541 --> 12:45.671
the time will be
12.:22 in Hong Kong.

12:45.945 --> 12:47.674
(Face)
Murdock,
will you listen to me?

12:47.747 --> 12:50.409
Now, we've got a job to do
and here's how
we're gonna run it.

12:50.483 --> 12:55.079
Now, General Barnaby,
he was your C.O. in Nam.
You got that?

12:55.154 --> 12:57.452
And he needs
a kidney transplant. So--

12:57.523 --> 12:58.547
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

12:58.624 --> 13:01.889
l gave a kidney away
last year to Colonel Morgan.

13:01.961 --> 13:03.622
And year before that
it was Westmoreland...

13:03.696 --> 13:05.186
and l gave my lung away
the year before that...

13:05.264 --> 13:06.322
to my Aunt Sophie.

13:06.399 --> 13:08.697
We even took out your spleen
eight months ago, didn't we?

13:08.801 --> 13:11.565
l'm practically
a shell of my former self.

13:11.871 --> 13:15.500
Well, l'll tell you,
sometimes this is moving
too fast for me, you know.

13:15.641 --> 13:19.133
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Did we ever give you
a lobotomy?

13:19.312 --> 13:23.146
No sweat.
Oh, Guy of the Countenance!
l've got this thing handled.

13:23.216 --> 13:24.478
Now, wait a minute, Murdock...

13:24.550 --> 13:26.017
the Colonel's
waiting for us, huh?

13:26.085 --> 13:29.145
And this is a kidnapping,
so, you know, we don't have
a lot of spare time.

13:29.255 --> 13:30.779
l have tunneled my way out.

13:30.857 --> 13:32.154
You tunneled...

13:32.225 --> 13:34.193
Murdock, that went out
with Hogan's Heroes.

13:34.393 --> 13:38.591
Right behind
the psychiatric boardroom,
there's a sundeck.

13:38.664 --> 13:40.825
Right behind that is
a walkway with a tree.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.925
Meet me right there. Bye-bye.

13:44.637 --> 13:47.299
l give him 10 minutes
and then l go
for the lobotomy.

13:56.482 --> 13:59.610
Man, l can't believe
he wanted me to
give another kidney.

13:59.919 --> 14:02.979
Give, give, give.

14:43.963 --> 14:46.295
(Dr. Craig)
l've seen too many cases
of schizophrenia...

14:46.365 --> 14:47.992
and far too many cases...

14:48.067 --> 14:51.662
of those trying to perpetrate
a fraud on hospitals
and government funding.

14:51.737 --> 14:53.295
Face, l'm here.

15:04.517 --> 15:08.419
Look, you've asked me here
specifically to review
Mr. Murdock's case.

15:08.654 --> 15:11.851
l continue to feel
the man's a fraud.

15:12.091 --> 15:15.458
Certainly, you all had
a chance to review
Mr. Murdock's file. Yes?

15:15.828 --> 15:18.888
[sawing]
And there are times
when he appears quite lucid.

15:18.965 --> 15:23.595
So these reports
of violent outbursts
and aberrant behavior....

15:24.036 --> 15:26.197
l mean, is there a....

15:26.272 --> 15:28.638
You just can't put
any credence in them.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.734
[thudding]
l know this man. l've been
in the same room with him.

15:31.811 --> 15:35.577
We're soul brothers.
That man is as sane as l am.

15:35.648 --> 15:36.672
[mimicking Bugs Bunny]

15:36.749 --> 15:38.307
What's up, Doc?

15:39.452 --> 15:41.283
Bob, call security quickly.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.456
Oh, me lady.

15:57.737 --> 15:58.829
Murdock?

16:10.182 --> 16:13.913
No problem. No problem.
l got him. l got him.

16:19.058 --> 16:20.457
So, sue me.

16:55.594 --> 16:58.620
Hey, Augie.
You want l should
go in with you?

16:58.798 --> 17:01.631
Why? You afraid of staying
out here alone?

17:01.901 --> 17:03.027
[chuckling]

17:08.040 --> 17:10.234
[speaking in European accent]
Good evening, sir.

17:18.851 --> 17:21.786
Hey, l ain't never
seen you before.

17:22.154 --> 17:25.055
May l take your coat?

17:25.624 --> 17:27.022
[groaning]
No.

17:30.663 --> 17:33.928
May l take your tie?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.391
Okay, where is Mordente?

17:37.670 --> 17:41.037
He is in the study, sir.

17:42.241 --> 17:45.404
l have not announced you yet.

17:45.745 --> 17:49.237
l don't need no announcement.
The Judge and l are pals.

17:52.885 --> 17:56.184
May l take your shoes, sir?

17:56.555 --> 17:57.544
Hey, Judge.

17:57.623 --> 18:00.615
What's with the Addams Family
come to work here
all of a sudden?

18:00.693 --> 18:02.627
You ain't getting funny on me,
are you, Judge?

18:02.695 --> 18:04.560
No, no, l swear to you.

18:04.630 --> 18:08.259
The man was supposed
to come to work tomorrow.
He came today, a day early.

18:08.334 --> 18:11.963
My other servant, the old man,
had an illness in his family
and had to leave.

18:12.037 --> 18:14.301
Yeah. Well...

18:14.640 --> 18:17.165
there's a little illness
in this guy's family,
too, huh?

18:17.243 --> 18:20.144
My daughter. How is she?
Here. Look it up.

18:23.482 --> 18:24.608
So...

18:25.151 --> 18:28.882
how's my favorite
jury coming, huh?

18:28.954 --> 18:31.149
lt's a little early to tell.

18:31.223 --> 18:35.057
Well, what do we care.
Because whatever they say...

18:35.828 --> 18:39.628
you are gonna
make it right, right?

18:39.698 --> 18:41.928
May l take your socks?

18:42.001 --> 18:43.525
Now, get rid of this creep.

18:43.602 --> 18:46.662
Then may l take your picture?

18:48.274 --> 18:49.741
[groaning]

18:50.376 --> 18:52.776
Hey, okay, now.

18:53.612 --> 18:54.738
Okay.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.111
Now...

18:59.852 --> 19:03.447
may we take your clothes, sir?

19:03.589 --> 19:05.454
[camera clicking]
You're all dead, you hear?

19:05.524 --> 19:08.823
The Judge's little girl
is dead, you hear?
Hey, Judge, you hear me?

19:08.894 --> 19:11.727
So much for the left profile.
Now a little bit
of the right profile.

19:11.797 --> 19:12.889
You hear me, Judge?

19:14.867 --> 19:17.062
(Augie)
Your little girl's
gonna pay, Judge.

19:17.736 --> 19:20.364
You hear that, Judge?
Get out here.

19:20.940 --> 19:22.532
l hope you know
what you're doing.

19:22.608 --> 19:24.735
We're dealing with
savage people, Judge.

19:24.810 --> 19:28.337
Now, Scarlett didn't go
to all that trouble
to beat a murder rap...

19:28.414 --> 19:31.975
just so he can release
your daughter who can
send him up for kidnapping.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.157
Here you go, Colonel.

19:42.228 --> 19:44.788
l thought you could use
a blow-up for some
of the detail work.

19:44.930 --> 19:45.954
(Hannibal)
Nice.

19:46.232 --> 19:48.462
Could you get me
a three-quarter left?
Sure.

19:49.101 --> 19:52.127
Gee, it looks like it's gonna
have to be let out
a little in the waist.

19:52.204 --> 19:53.398
No kidding?
Yeah.

19:53.472 --> 19:55.940
Okay. You do it.
Right.

20:02.548 --> 20:05.039
Whatever you guys
are gonna try, you're gonna
get away with zip.

20:05.117 --> 20:06.516
We got every precaution.

20:06.585 --> 20:09.019
You try and find that girl,
you better decide...

20:09.088 --> 20:11.784
you want her buried
in cherry wood or pine.

20:11.857 --> 20:14.519
Nobody sees that girl
but me and who l say.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.894
(Hannibal)
That's exactly
what we figured.

20:24.803 --> 20:28.899
Oh, that's good, Colonel.
He wore it on the left.
Little further back.

20:29.174 --> 20:31.438
l don't believe it.
You're me!

20:31.510 --> 20:33.637
You never looked this good.

20:48.093 --> 20:51.187
You took your sweet time.
Some kind of trouble?

20:51.263 --> 20:53.823
Nobody gives me trouble.
Just drive the car.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.231
Tough guy.

21:25.297 --> 21:27.891
You thinkin'?
Yeah, l'm thinkin'.

21:27.967 --> 21:29.992
'Cause you're real quiet.

21:34.406 --> 21:36.101
l'm quiet 'cause l'm thinkin'.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.803
When l'm done thinkin'
then l'll be done bein' quiet!

21:38.877 --> 21:40.344
l was just asking.

21:42.348 --> 21:43.975
'Cause you was quiet.

21:45.818 --> 21:47.683
'Cause l was thinkin'.

22:27.326 --> 22:28.418
[tires screeching]

22:38.737 --> 22:39.795
Hey!

22:40.072 --> 22:41.369
[shotgun cocking]

22:48.647 --> 22:50.046
Hiya, doll.

22:50.115 --> 22:52.481
What are you, crazy?
You don't give the knock?

22:58.490 --> 23:01.323
Maybe he's testing me again.
Yes, Augie?

23:01.894 --> 23:03.657
He likes to test me.

23:04.329 --> 23:06.763
So how's the girl, huh?

23:07.633 --> 23:11.228
She still doesn't eat.
Maybe that's why
she's so skinny.

23:12.371 --> 23:13.929
Well, l'm starving, eh?

23:16.008 --> 23:18.169
How about something for me?
Come on.

23:18.243 --> 23:19.335
Hey!

23:25.984 --> 23:27.315
He's thinkin'.

23:33.325 --> 23:34.349
[door closing]

23:34.426 --> 23:38.385
Lori, you don't look
too skinny to me. But l think
you ought to eat more.

23:38.997 --> 23:41.022
Don't, you try anything
and l'll....

23:41.100 --> 23:42.089
Shh.

23:42.468 --> 23:44.834
Your father sent me.
My father?

23:45.437 --> 23:47.769
l'm Hannibal Smith.
Your voice?

23:47.940 --> 23:50.636
My friends and l are gonna try
and get you out of here.

23:50.709 --> 23:53.177
Now, l'll loosen these ropes.
l don't understand.

23:53.245 --> 23:56.180
So you can slide out
if you need to.

23:57.349 --> 23:59.715
There. Just hang in there.

24:01.453 --> 24:04.479
Have they hurt you?
No. You can help me?

24:07.793 --> 24:09.090
lt's gonna be all right.

24:10.863 --> 24:13.627
lf you don't like it,
cook for yourself!

24:16.101 --> 24:18.228
How many times
l gotta eat it, huh?

24:20.272 --> 24:21.637
[laughing]
l mean...

24:21.707 --> 24:24.642
how many times
can you eat the same thing?

24:24.710 --> 24:27.372
Look who l'm asking.
You love that stuff.

24:28.013 --> 24:29.537
That's why she makes it.

24:29.615 --> 24:30.877
[gun cocking]

24:37.723 --> 24:40.351
You ain't fooling me, friend.
l know.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.855
What do you know?
Don't play with me.

24:43.428 --> 24:45.225
That whole act don't fool me.

24:45.898 --> 24:47.490
l've been doing
a lot of my own thinkin'.

24:47.566 --> 24:49.591
l wasn't born under
the armpit of no rabbit.

24:51.637 --> 24:54.970
That game
you and Marta played
don't fool nobody.

24:55.941 --> 24:58.967
l see the way you was
lookin' at one another.
l know.

24:59.178 --> 25:02.375
She used to look at me
that way when she was
Sally Boy's girl.

25:02.548 --> 25:04.345
l can't believe
you'd do this to me.

25:04.416 --> 25:06.816
Nicky, you don't know nothing.
l don't know nothing, huh?

25:06.885 --> 25:10.150
Her always cookin' those
Polish sausages for you.

25:10.222 --> 25:13.555
Me, l hate Polish sausages.
They make me sick.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.388
This whole thing
makes me sick!

25:15.828 --> 25:17.853
What is Mr. Scarlett
gonna think?

25:18.897 --> 25:20.364
You pull that trigger...

25:21.099 --> 25:23.499
and blow this
whole thing over a broad.

25:23.902 --> 25:26.496
Nicky,
if l was smart enough...

25:27.306 --> 25:29.035
to get a looker like Marta...

25:30.175 --> 25:34.805
l wouldn't be dumb enough
to try and take her
from you, huh?

25:35.314 --> 25:39.216
lf you're lyin',
you're dying, Augie.

26:32.971 --> 26:35.963
He drives me crazy.
l can't stand him anymore.

26:36.675 --> 26:40.372
Well, l think Nicky knows.
Who cares?

26:41.179 --> 26:43.807
Tonight, l give him
the kiss of death.

26:44.283 --> 26:46.513
Yeah, well,
at least he'll die happy.

26:46.685 --> 26:48.880
Then you and l, we go.
Yeah.

26:48.987 --> 26:50.545
Until Scarlett finds us.

26:50.622 --> 26:54.149
With $500,000, we can be
pretty hard to find.

26:54.226 --> 26:55.853
Every penny
Nicky has earned...

26:55.928 --> 26:58.362
he thinks it is still in that
numbered Swiss account.

26:58.430 --> 27:01.729
That bookkeeper gave me
that number a long time ago.

27:02.167 --> 27:05.864
l moved all the money.
Nicky still doesn't know.

27:06.538 --> 27:09.769
And he never will.
Well, that sounds wonderful...

27:10.676 --> 27:12.735
unless l wake up
with my throat cut.

27:12.811 --> 27:15.974
Only if l catch you
looking at other women, huh?

27:16.048 --> 27:18.482
That redhead in
trailer number 10?

27:19.151 --> 27:21.085
But you are
too smart to do that.

27:21.353 --> 27:23.344
You are different
than all of the others.

27:23.422 --> 27:25.390
l thought it would be
something like that.

27:30.762 --> 27:33.060
''So when Peter Pan
found out that Tiger Lily...

27:33.131 --> 27:35.861
''and the Little Lost Boys
had been captured
by Captain Hook...

27:35.934 --> 27:37.799
''he and Wendy...''
Now, that's his main squeeze.

27:37.869 --> 27:40.531
B.A., why don't you
drop me off at this next
corner up here?

27:40.605 --> 27:42.539
l'm gonna dig up
what l can on Joe Scarlett.

27:42.607 --> 27:44.302
l'll meet you guys
back at the Judge's.

27:44.643 --> 27:46.907
''He and Wendy went
looking for their friends...

27:46.979 --> 27:49.106
''but what he didn't know...''

27:50.515 --> 27:52.745
B.A., have you been eating
Murdock's books again?

27:53.318 --> 27:54.808
(Murdock)
l can't believe that.

27:54.886 --> 27:56.353
How will l find out
the ending?

27:56.421 --> 27:58.252
Now, l'll never know
what happened.

28:00.092 --> 28:02.492
[tires screeching]

28:16.174 --> 28:17.573
[guns firing]

28:22.147 --> 28:24.081
l can't believe
l let that happen.

28:24.282 --> 28:25.715
lt was just as much my fault.

28:25.784 --> 28:27.513
Who would have thought
he'd try that?

28:27.586 --> 28:28.883
He could have been killed.

28:28.954 --> 28:31.422
Yeah. Well,
he probably figured
he's good as dead anyway...

28:31.490 --> 28:33.185
when Joe Scarlett
got a hold of him.

28:33.525 --> 28:35.322
Now, we have no way
to warn the Colonel.

28:35.761 --> 28:37.558
(Cindy)
Well, good afternoon.

28:39.664 --> 28:42.656
lt certainly seems to be.

28:44.503 --> 28:47.199
And where has
my Augie-Waugie been?

28:47.739 --> 28:48.728
Oh...

28:49.741 --> 28:51.072
busy-wizzy.

28:52.911 --> 28:56.847
The phone broke down
in my place and l thought
maybe l could use yours.

28:56.915 --> 28:59.941
Maybe, if you rub my back.

29:00.419 --> 29:02.944
Yeah. Well, it is important.

29:04.056 --> 29:05.648
And l have to make the call.

29:06.625 --> 29:09.822
All right, but hurry back.
l burn easily.

29:10.328 --> 29:11.727
Yeah, bet you do.

29:25.343 --> 29:26.833
[telephone ringing]

29:31.616 --> 29:33.516
Hello. Yes.

29:34.519 --> 29:37.044
Yes, they are.
lt's Smith.

29:39.991 --> 29:42.050
Colonel,
thank heavens you called.

29:42.127 --> 29:43.651
What's the matter?
Augie got away.

29:43.728 --> 29:45.787
lt's all my fault.
l should've been
ready for him...

29:45.864 --> 29:47.161
but he could be there
anytime now.

29:47.232 --> 29:48.460
Okay, listen up.

29:48.767 --> 29:51.634
l'm at the Pleasant
View Motor Park off l-10.

29:51.903 --> 29:53.632
A 40-foot RV at the back.

29:53.705 --> 29:55.764
Beige, brown stripes,
green awning.

29:55.841 --> 29:58.241
Now there's a guard,
right inside the main gate...

29:58.310 --> 29:59.834
and then there's
an Airstream...

29:59.911 --> 30:02.311
and a camper pick-up
right near the hot spot.

30:02.380 --> 30:05.440
l count three armed outside,
and two inside.

30:05.684 --> 30:07.276
We're on our way, Colonel.
Okay.

30:07.452 --> 30:11.183
These guys are ready.
Don't let them see you comin'.

30:20.098 --> 30:21.656
Colonel, you were right.

30:21.733 --> 30:24.201
The wire tap on Mordente's
telephone paid off.

30:24.269 --> 30:26.260
Smith just called him.
We trace it?

30:26.338 --> 30:28.101
Didn't have to,
Smith said where he was.

30:28.473 --> 30:30.964
''Pleasant View
Motor Park off l-10.''

30:32.077 --> 30:33.305
Let's do it.

30:42.921 --> 30:44.354
[dog barking]

30:58.103 --> 31:00.401
(Augie)
Hiya, baby.
l'll see you later.

31:01.406 --> 31:02.395
Augie?

31:02.474 --> 31:03.941
l said l'd see you later.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.500
But Augie, how did you get
out of my trailer?

31:09.247 --> 31:10.441
You stay right here.

31:11.116 --> 31:12.242
Augie?

31:16.922 --> 31:17.946

31:18.023 --> 31:19.149

31:47.419 --> 31:48.613

31:58.396 --> 32:00.387
Thanks for the use
of the phone.

32:05.670 --> 32:06.967
[gun cocking]

32:39.738 --> 32:42.434
Excuse me.
Gee, l love that hat.

32:42.574 --> 32:46.169
Listen, l need
somebody to talk to
about taking that RV.

32:46.244 --> 32:48.371
l'm from Acme Axle Repair.

34:08.693 --> 34:09.887
(Nicky)
You better tell me...

34:09.960 --> 34:11.518
how many people
you got working for you.

34:11.596 --> 34:13.393
Or what? You'll kill me?

34:14.498 --> 34:18.264
Seems to me l get
that door prize whether
l talk to you or not, pal.

34:18.402 --> 34:21.429
lt's just a matter of how much
you end up liking it.

34:21.940 --> 34:25.170
See Marta here?
She used to be a nurse
for a plastic surgeon.

34:25.243 --> 34:28.268
She knows all kinds of stuff
about knives and skin.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.408
And real bad hurts.

34:30.482 --> 34:34.179
l'll bet she likes to
cut people's throats
while they're asleep.

34:34.252 --> 34:35.775
What you messing with him for?

34:35.853 --> 34:37.879
l told you how many guys
l saw at the Judge's.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.322
We ought to take him out
and whack him.
You shut up.

34:40.391 --> 34:42.690
Just tell them to get
the chopper here.
lt's on the way.

34:42.761 --> 34:45.286
Judge wasn't supposed
to call nobody.
No cops. Nobody.

34:45.697 --> 34:47.960
These guys ain't cops.
Look here.

34:48.366 --> 34:50.596
You let your lQ peek
through for a minute.

34:50.735 --> 34:53.898
l don't know, Nicky.
He pulled the tarp
over your eyes.

34:53.972 --> 34:56.235
What're you talking?
Him and your lady here.

34:56.306 --> 34:58.468
l ought to
plug you right here.
Hold!

34:59.377 --> 35:00.503
What are you talkin'?

35:00.578 --> 35:04.981
Nick, you said
you thought Marta was
involved with somebody.

35:05.884 --> 35:07.249
What are you
listening him for?

35:07.318 --> 35:08.683
What are you
so nervous about?

35:08.753 --> 35:10.880
'Cause we ought to whack him.
Maybe l should whack you.

35:10.955 --> 35:12.616
(Hannibal)
Sure, Augie.
That way...

35:12.690 --> 35:14.920
she doesn't have to split
Nicky's dough with you.

35:14.993 --> 35:16.255
[shouting in foreign language]

35:16.528 --> 35:18.860
Be nice.
Money? What money? What?

35:18.930 --> 35:21.296
All that money you had
in the Swiss bank account.

35:22.133 --> 35:23.930
The money that Marta moved.

35:26.471 --> 35:29.133
Nobody whacks nobody
till l find out
what's goin' on here.

36:00.171 --> 36:01.832
Howdy to you.

36:01.906 --> 36:04.238
How're doing there?
Nice looking outfit you got.

36:04.309 --> 36:08.973
Listen, could you
point me the direction
of the main office here?

36:09.047 --> 36:10.173
l....

36:11.149 --> 36:13.447
Well, now, that's ever
so nice of you.

36:14.853 --> 36:16.582
Keep right on movin', pal.

36:19.724 --> 36:21.851
Hey, what's goin' on
over there?

36:22.393 --> 36:24.122
[guns firing]

36:44.449 --> 36:46.076
Get down. Stay there.

36:46.150 --> 36:47.515
What's goin' on here?

37:20.885 --> 37:23.353
Man, here comes Hannibal.
Let's give him cover.

37:38.803 --> 37:39.929
You guys all right?

37:40.004 --> 37:42.734
l'm telling you,
finding a spot in these
trailer parks is murder.

37:42.807 --> 37:44.468
Where's the girl?
She's still in there.

37:44.542 --> 37:46.339
lf we can keep her there,
we got it made.

37:46.411 --> 37:47.935
[guns firing]
Give me a weapon.

37:48.580 --> 37:49.569
[bullets ricocheting]

37:49.981 --> 37:51.642
[sirens wailing]

38:04.262 --> 38:05.490
Oh, no!

38:14.539 --> 38:16.734
Guys, it's Decker!

38:16.808 --> 38:20.505
(Decker on megaphone)
Smith, this is Colonel Decker.
Come out with your hands up.

38:20.578 --> 38:21.602
ls he kidding?

38:21.679 --> 38:24.307
You're completely surrounded.
You can count on it.

38:24.382 --> 38:25.610
l don't believe this.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.081
[helicopter whirring]

38:32.223 --> 38:33.554
[gun firing]

38:35.026 --> 38:36.493
Return fire!

39:07.558 --> 39:09.219
Get that chopper, Captain.

39:14.532 --> 39:18.024
None of the A-Team, sir.
Concentrate on that trailer!

39:29.047 --> 39:30.674
Let's get out of here!

40:39.917 --> 40:41.111
Gino.

40:41.919 --> 40:43.045
Gino.

40:46.557 --> 40:49.754
l can't believe
you came all this way.
Giuseppe, or Joe?

40:50.361 --> 40:52.625
Joe, that's what
they call you here.

40:52.864 --> 40:55.230
Come on, Gino.
Joe Scarlett.

40:55.633 --> 40:58.796
The scourge
of the American underworld.

40:59.403 --> 41:02.372
Okay, Gino, enough already.

41:03.474 --> 41:06.875
Enough? Enough is right.

41:08.279 --> 41:11.043
Are you ready to
come back with me?
Come back?

41:11.816 --> 41:13.408
America has been good to me.

41:13.484 --> 41:16.146
Oh, looks like
it's been good to you.

41:16.721 --> 41:18.120
You come here...

41:18.856 --> 41:22.451
become a boss
of a bunch of idiots.

41:24.395 --> 41:28.092
They can't even
sit on this girl
until you're free.

41:28.166 --> 41:31.226
What are you talkin' about?
They still got her.

41:31.402 --> 41:32.562
l got her.

41:33.271 --> 41:36.798
And she stays with me
until this is finished.

41:36.874 --> 41:38.398
You don't understand, Gino.

41:40.645 --> 41:42.909
You never did.
You're right.

41:43.948 --> 41:45.313
l never did.

41:46.617 --> 41:49.017
lt was always you, Gino.
Always.

41:49.787 --> 41:52.984
Papa would teach you,
talk to you,
and put you in charge.

41:54.192 --> 41:58.288
l was little Giuseppe.
Little Giuseppe this,
little Giuseppe that.

41:58.629 --> 42:00.824
Here, l'm somebody.

42:01.165 --> 42:03.690
People are afraid of me.
Joe Scarlett.

42:04.635 --> 42:08.469
That name means something.
They shake when
l walk into a room.

42:09.140 --> 42:12.371
l'm a big man, Gino.
l'm a big man here.

42:12.777 --> 42:16.269
You're a big man, my brother.

42:18.316 --> 42:20.614
You're a very big man.

42:22.253 --> 42:25.222
You are my brother.
We are blood.

42:27.592 --> 42:29.150
l do for you.

42:29.660 --> 42:32.060
l get you out of this mess...

42:32.263 --> 42:35.357
that you always got into
since you were younger.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.200
You and l will know...

42:39.103 --> 42:41.264
l got you out of this.

42:42.807 --> 42:47.244
l make you a big boss again.

42:48.846 --> 42:50.006
Guard!

42:50.848 --> 42:55.308
You tell your big-time
American lawyer
that he call me...

42:55.486 --> 42:57.477
at my home in Palermo...

42:58.456 --> 43:00.754
to tell me of your release.

43:09.166 --> 43:10.793
[door clanks shut]

43:13.704 --> 43:14.966
Kay, l can't tell you...

43:15.039 --> 43:17.234
how much l've been
impressed by your work
at the office.

43:17.708 --> 43:20.506
For a junior law clerk,
you really have
a future ahead of you.

43:21.345 --> 43:22.972
Yes. What is it?

43:28.286 --> 43:29.412
Which phone?

43:31.522 --> 43:33.422
(Face)
Payphone, right over there.

43:33.591 --> 43:34.751
Excuse me for a minute.

43:40.898 --> 43:45.062
Well, he certainly knows
his champagne. May l?

43:47.571 --> 43:48.833
We have 10 minutes.

43:48.906 --> 43:51.374
Why don't you tell me
everything about yourself?

43:52.476 --> 43:55.570
Joe?
lt's me calling.

44:01.185 --> 44:02.311
(Shaber)
Hey!

44:02.687 --> 44:07.420
l tell you, if you've ever
seen the sun go down behind
Chappaquiddick Mountain....

44:07.491 --> 44:10.585
l swear.
l don't know anything about
Judge Mordente's daughter.

44:10.661 --> 44:12.151
l'm just an attorney.

44:13.831 --> 44:15.423
Please!

44:15.967 --> 44:17.161
[gasping]

44:17.702 --> 44:19.693
You better get
used to it, fool.
Because you're gonna be...

44:19.770 --> 44:21.795
spending a lot of time
in hospitals
in the near future.

44:21.872 --> 44:23.464
Please, you don't understand.

44:24.075 --> 44:26.009
Scarlett would kill me.

44:26.610 --> 44:29.135
And his brother--
Wait. Wait, wait.

44:32.216 --> 44:33.547
Hold on the presses, Marty...

44:33.617 --> 44:35.676
l think we got a hot one
coming over the wire.

44:38.956 --> 44:41.584
lt's the most
magnificent sight.
See, it sort of just--

44:41.659 --> 44:44.787
Hey! We're on our way.
We gotta pick up
Hannibal at the Judge's.

44:44.862 --> 44:46.523
ltaly, my friend. ltaly.

44:48.265 --> 44:49.459
ltaly.

44:50.668 --> 44:52.067
And we ain't flyin'.

45:28.773 --> 45:30.707
That's where they're
holding her all right.
Yeah?

45:30.775 --> 45:32.242
Well, l guess
when you're the local don...

45:32.309 --> 45:34.243
you don't have to worry
about keeping a low profile.

45:34.311 --> 45:37.644
l mean, who's gonna
mess with you?
This is a front door job.

45:37.715 --> 45:40.183
No, Hannibal.
We did that at the trailer.

45:40.251 --> 45:42.515
We're not gonna try that
twice in a row, are we?

45:42.586 --> 45:43.780
Sure we are.

45:44.422 --> 45:46.720
We'll need a back door out.
Yeah.

45:46.791 --> 45:48.850
Well, there's a dirt airstrip
over that hill there.

45:48.926 --> 45:51.952
We can get a DC-3 off of it.
But we'll have to refuel...

45:52.029 --> 45:54.520
and that's going to
drain us of our remaining
working capital.

45:54.598 --> 45:56.828
But we'll be on our way home.

45:56.901 --> 45:57.993
[B.A. groaning]

46:01.072 --> 46:02.061
[yawns]

46:03.808 --> 46:05.537
(B.A.)
You guys
put me on a plane.

46:05.609 --> 46:08.373
(B.A.)
You dead.
You hear me? Dead.

46:10.614 --> 46:12.206
You put me on a plane.

46:13.851 --> 46:16.149
That's what you done.
We're in ltaly, right?

46:16.220 --> 46:18.279
You guys knocked me out
and flew me to ltaly.

46:18.355 --> 46:22.121
And if you keep up
this unsightly behavior,
we shall be dead in ltaly.

46:22.193 --> 46:23.956
Those are the bad guys.

46:24.028 --> 46:26.462
No more, you hear?
No more planes.

46:26.530 --> 46:28.828
l'm gonna help you guys rescue
that poor little girl...

46:28.899 --> 46:30.366
but we ain't
getting on no plane.

46:30.768 --> 46:33.396
B.A., we haven't got a plane.

46:33.771 --> 46:36.035
(Hannibal)
The one that Face scammed
is out of gas.

46:36.107 --> 46:37.972
We have to find
some other way home.

46:38.876 --> 46:41.242
Now, let's concentrate on
rescuing the girl.

46:41.312 --> 46:42.870
Hannibal has a plan.

46:43.514 --> 46:45.607
We're going through
the front door again, right?

46:46.350 --> 46:48.716
l think he's
getting to know me.
Let's go.

46:57.094 --> 46:58.891
[birds chirping]

47:01.532 --> 47:04.626
lf my father does
what you ask,
will you let me go?

47:04.802 --> 47:07.293
Kidnapping is such
a tricky business.

47:08.005 --> 47:11.907
First, we see
what the good Judge decides
about my wonderful brother...

47:11.976 --> 47:14.809
then we see
what Don Scarlatti decides...

47:15.179 --> 47:18.171
about the Judge's
lovely daughter.

47:28.259 --> 47:29.726
Guido?
Si.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.155
l leave Salvatore
here with you.

47:32.530 --> 47:35.693
As soon as you hear from me,
take her out and....

47:36.066 --> 47:37.260
Capiche?
Capiche.

47:39.637 --> 47:40.729
[car door closing]

[car horn honking]

48:04.161 --> 48:06.755
[speaking in ltalian]

48:07.531 --> 48:09.431
All right, all right.
Silenzio.

48:17.274 --> 48:18.400
[groaning]

48:18.475 --> 48:19.772
[horse snorting]

48:31.755 --> 48:32.983
Jeez.

48:35.593 --> 48:37.083
Helpless old man.

48:37.728 --> 48:40.458
[grunting]
Why don't you hire somebody
to give you a hand?

48:42.933 --> 48:45.333
lf l had a son like you,
l'd shoot myself.

48:45.402 --> 48:47.097
l just might do
that for you...

48:47.171 --> 48:49.537
if you don't hurry up
in getting this cart
unloaded and go.

48:49.607 --> 48:50.835
Grazie, grazie.

48:50.908 --> 48:53.934
You have one more bad deed
on your conscience
when you go to die.

48:54.812 --> 48:56.143
[birds chirping]

48:57.281 --> 49:01.183
Hey, you're not
from around here?

49:01.685 --> 49:04.654
No, l come from America.

49:05.322 --> 49:08.291
Chicago, the land of the home
and the braves.

49:08.359 --> 49:10.987
Why do you think
l got no accent, huh?

49:11.195 --> 49:12.526
[horse nickering]

49:16.700 --> 49:17.826
[yells]

49:22.072 --> 49:23.664
Stop! Please!

49:43.093 --> 49:44.117
[groaning]

49:44.194 --> 49:45.456
Missed me.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.292
[grunting]

49:56.340 --> 49:57.864
[exclaiming]

49:58.442 --> 49:59.431
[groaning]

50:10.020 --> 50:11.214
[both grunting]

50:32.076 --> 50:33.703
Give me, give me.

50:36.580 --> 50:37.740
[grunting]

50:43.320 --> 50:45.015
l can't believe
you came after me.

50:45.189 --> 50:46.816
Yeah, we're pretty amazing.

50:53.630 --> 50:54.790
Face!

51:06.910 --> 51:08.138
Get in the car!

51:09.346 --> 51:10.472
Move!

52:09.106 --> 52:10.095
[guns firing]

52:29.126 --> 52:30.252
[bullet ricocheting]

53:06.497 --> 53:10.058
l knew it.
l knew you guys were trying
to put me on a plane.

53:10.133 --> 53:13.034
l just want to stop by
and pick up my suitcase.

53:13.103 --> 53:15.037
l told you, l don't
go on no plane.

53:15.105 --> 53:18.700
l'll go by boat
or l'll even drive,
but no flying.

53:25.048 --> 53:28.484
l really believe that
this is not the proper time...

53:28.552 --> 53:30.884
for such a debate,
Mr. Baracus!

53:30.954 --> 53:31.978
l ain't flying!

53:32.055 --> 53:35.115
Then time to drop us off
and write when you get work.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.421
[guns firing]

53:39.530 --> 53:41.395
Okay, B.A., slow down.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.326
B.A.!

53:45.435 --> 53:48.768
Hey, B.A., slow down!
No, no flying!

54:25.075 --> 54:27.873
How could you do that
to a poor, defenseless
DC-3?

54:27.945 --> 54:29.378
She didn't stand a chance.

54:29.446 --> 54:30.936
l don't believe this.

54:31.014 --> 54:34.415
Now we're stuck
in this country without
any means of escape!

54:36.119 --> 54:38.280
The Captain has
a point there, B.A.

54:38.355 --> 54:39.788
What do you got
to say about it?

54:40.190 --> 54:41.555
We ain't flyin'.

54:46.296 --> 54:47.490
[sighing]

55:00.277 --> 55:01.835
Well, l like it.

55:02.512 --> 55:04.912
And, well, l spent
all our funds...

55:04.982 --> 55:07.883
getting the plane
and artillery
for this little jaunt.

55:07.951 --> 55:10.351
So, l have
only enough money...

55:10.420 --> 55:13.014
for, maybe, maybe one room.

55:13.256 --> 55:14.450
l like it.

55:14.524 --> 55:17.857
Gonna have to get
accommodations for all of us
without any money.

55:17.928 --> 55:19.361
Of course.
Of course.

55:20.631 --> 55:22.030
Now, Face...

55:23.266 --> 55:26.030
if we had endless amounts
of money at our disposal...

55:26.103 --> 55:28.697
and could do whatever we want,
whenever we wanted...

55:28.772 --> 55:31.400
we wouldn't really need you,
now would we?

55:31.475 --> 55:32.999
That's why l stick around,
Hannibal.

55:33.076 --> 55:34.703
You have such
a wonderful way...

55:34.778 --> 55:37.076
of making one feel
so much a part of the team.

55:37.147 --> 55:40.139
Well, what can you do?
l mean, if you haven't
any money...

55:40.217 --> 55:43.015
and you don't know
anyone onboard,
how will you get us on?

55:43.086 --> 55:45.748
Well, it's really
just a matter...

55:45.822 --> 55:48.518
of looking like you know
what you are doing,
you know...

55:48.592 --> 55:52.551
and then steering
a wide enough berth...

55:52.629 --> 55:54.756
until someone fills
in the proper blank.

55:59.102 --> 56:01.570
Which someone
eventually always does.

56:01.638 --> 56:05.472
But it does help
when just the right person
fills in the blanks.

56:05.542 --> 56:07.009
Correct, Lieutenant?

56:12.182 --> 56:13.274
All right.

56:13.684 --> 56:15.675
Peck, Templeton Peck.

56:15.986 --> 56:17.749
The new replacement?

56:18.588 --> 56:22.115
Carla Singer,
Entertainment Director.
Well, how do you do?

56:22.192 --> 56:23.750
lt's very nice to meet you.

56:23.994 --> 56:27.521
You know, l really thought
l was going to
miss the boat. Ship.

56:28.265 --> 56:31.166
See, l was
supposed to meet you
at your last port of call...

56:31.234 --> 56:34.067
but l was 10 minutes late,
so l got down here
as fast as l could.

56:34.137 --> 56:37.038
Right. All right.
Yeah. l'm so glad l did.

56:37.340 --> 56:41.174
Well, you must either be
the new pool boy
or Doctor Forbes' assistant.

56:41.578 --> 56:42.636
[knocking on door]

56:44.448 --> 56:47.008
Dr. Forbes,
l hope l'm not interrupting.

56:47.084 --> 56:49.416
l'm Dr. Peck,
your new assistant.

56:49.720 --> 56:52.018
Well, they told me
l couldn't have one.
Really?

56:52.089 --> 56:55.547
Well, be that as it may,
here l am.

56:55.625 --> 56:58.355
They give you all that grot
about budgets, cutbacks--

56:58.428 --> 57:00.259
Right, right, right.

57:01.565 --> 57:03.556
You mind, if l....

57:03.633 --> 57:06.625
No, no, no, no,
you might as well
look the part.

57:06.703 --> 57:09.934
lt's about as close to
being doctors as we get
aboard this thing.

57:11.007 --> 57:13.305
We just dispense the liniments
for the sunburn...

57:13.376 --> 57:16.004
and we try and assure
the people that there
never has been...

57:16.079 --> 57:18.843
a recorded case
of death by seasickness.

57:18.915 --> 57:20.576
Well, that suits me just fine.

57:20.951 --> 57:23.181
l mean, you....
After 15 operations a week...

57:23.253 --> 57:24.880
some lasting
eight, ten hours....

57:24.955 --> 57:26.889
l almost had
a nervous breakdown.

57:28.125 --> 57:30.286
l was recuperating
in ltaly, you know...

57:30.360 --> 57:32.760
and l decided to get back
into it real slow...

57:32.829 --> 57:35.525
and then
this offer cropped up.

57:36.333 --> 57:38.198
Where did you do
your pre-med work?

57:38.935 --> 57:42.371
Boston.
l interned at St. Francis.
You're kidding.

57:42.839 --> 57:44.534
Boston and St. Francis?

57:45.008 --> 57:46.600
Why, did you go there?

57:47.377 --> 57:51.108
No. No, l would have
liked to have gone there
when l was studying.

57:51.181 --> 57:52.671
Yeah, wonderful school.

57:56.253 --> 57:59.552
(purser)
l still don't understand
where you're going with that.

57:59.623 --> 58:02.183
l told you
l have to be ready...

58:02.259 --> 58:04.193
for when
Mr. Allerdyce arrives.

58:05.128 --> 58:09.189
But l don't have
a Mr. Allerdyce booked
on this cruise.

58:09.266 --> 58:12.394
Well, if the patient,
l mean, passenger
isn't booked on this cruise...

58:12.469 --> 58:15.131
then what am l
doing with the man's
medical records, huh?

58:15.205 --> 58:17.935
Why have they been
forwarded to me,
along with some rather...

58:18.008 --> 58:20.442
special medical equipment
to be set up in his cabin?

58:20.510 --> 58:24.537
Now, l suggest
that you do something
about this...

58:24.614 --> 58:25.911
especially,
considering the fact...

58:25.982 --> 58:29.247
that Mr. Allerdyce
is first cousin
to Conrad Stevens.

58:31.021 --> 58:34.787
Conrad Stevens.
Chairman of the
Carnival Cruise Lines.

58:36.927 --> 58:40.385
Well, no one has booked any
of the presidential suites.

58:41.097 --> 58:43.861
Well, l'm sure
they'll do just fine.

58:43.934 --> 58:45.060
The one on A-deck...

58:45.135 --> 58:47.603
so he doesn't have
that far to travel
to get out for some sun.

58:47.671 --> 58:51.334
That's perfect. l'll mention
your assistance in this matter
to Mr. Allerdyce.

58:51.408 --> 58:53.968
l'm sure he'll be
most appreciative.

58:54.744 --> 58:56.473
[ship horn blowing]

59:00.750 --> 59:03.082
No way.
l ain't going to let you
take care of me.

59:03.153 --> 59:05.644
You're the one who's sick.
You can't even
take care of nothing.

59:05.722 --> 59:09.214
Not true, not true, not true.

59:09.326 --> 59:13.387
B.A., it's your fault
that we're on this ship.
Now try and cooperate.

59:13.463 --> 59:16.296
Now, Lori, you have
the cabin next door.
There's your key.

59:16.366 --> 59:19.802
Oh, and this is for you.

59:19.903 --> 59:21.268
A package?
Mmm-hmm.

59:21.338 --> 59:23.670
Yeah, they have a really nice
boutique on the upper deck.

59:23.740 --> 59:27.369
Believe me, l know what
a strain kidnapping can put
on one's wardrobe.

59:27.444 --> 59:30.709
How thoughtful.
lt's just a little something.

59:31.948 --> 59:33.347
l'll say.

59:37.921 --> 59:41.152
What about us, Face?
You and l'll bunk
in the cruise quarters.

59:41.324 --> 59:42.814
And you're gonna be
the doctor?

59:42.893 --> 59:44.520
Assistant, Hannibal,
doctor's assistant.

59:44.594 --> 59:47.961
You still haven't told me
about the other job,
the one l'm stuck with.

59:48.031 --> 59:49.896
Haven't l?
Face.

59:51.234 --> 59:53.168
l could have
sworn l mentioned....

59:53.536 --> 59:56.437
Yeah, well, you are
going to help out...

59:56.506 --> 59:58.940
all the beautiful ladies
around the pool.

59:59.643 --> 01:00:01.508
You mean l'm the pool boy?

01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:04.342
Well, we like to
call them ''pool persons.''

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:06.279
Face.
Hannibal, l'm sorry...

01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:08.476
but, you know,
l figured that
we only had the money...

01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:10.519
for the one room for Lori...

01:00:10.587 --> 01:00:13.988
so, B.A., being the most
conspicuous, had to come in
as Mr. Allerdyce.

01:00:14.057 --> 01:00:16.821
Now, let's see.
Oh, yeah, that's you.

01:00:16.893 --> 01:00:18.884
You know
how you love a uniform.

01:00:19.896 --> 01:00:20.885
[door opening]

01:00:22.065 --> 01:00:24.329
Well, how do l look?

01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:26.024
[sighing]

01:00:26.102 --> 01:00:29.367
The pool, Hannibal,
it's gonna be flesh,
flesh and more flesh.

01:00:29.439 --> 01:00:31.304
What do you know about
being a doctor?

01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:33.342
Hannibal, please,
piece of cake.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:35.935
Besides,
90% of the cases
on board this ship...

01:00:36.012 --> 01:00:39.743
are nothing but sweet,
young things who've been
too long in the sun.

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:42.810
That's just wonderful.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.848
l could just sit here
for hours while you do that.

01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:52.160
Yeah.
Well, look, you can take
this tube with you--

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:54.093
Please don't stop.

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:58.333
No, you see, when you stop,
it just hurts so bad.

01:00:59.736 --> 01:01:03.832
Yeah. Well, now,
if you just use this stuff
twice a day, the....

01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:06.171
The label says
three times a day.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.837
Yeah, well they just
print that stuff.

01:01:08.912 --> 01:01:12.279
l mean, you can use it
three times a day,
if you feel you need to.

01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:15.247
Yes, make it
three times a day.

01:01:15.952 --> 01:01:17.214
Okay, bye now.

01:01:17.287 --> 01:01:18.618
(Forbes)
Dr. Peck.

01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:21.049
My assistant will be
with you momentarily.

01:01:21.124 --> 01:01:23.354
Mr. Liebowitz here
needs a colonic.

01:01:23.426 --> 01:01:25.223
Could you take care of him,
please?

01:01:27.397 --> 01:01:28.421
A colonic?

01:01:28.498 --> 01:01:29.658
[buzzing]

01:01:29.733 --> 01:01:31.325
Will you excuse me a minute?

01:01:41.277 --> 01:01:44.303
Believe it or not,
l would have rather
stayed here with you.

01:02:18.481 --> 01:02:21.848
[[[singing Volare]

01:02:23.987 --> 01:02:24.976
[clicks tongue]

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:29.215
Hey, who loves you, baby?

01:02:30.093 --> 01:02:31.424
Johnny?
Yeah.

01:02:31.494 --> 01:02:34.463
Here's the list of
anniversaries and birthdays
for this evening's show.

01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:37.295
Okay.
And Mrs. Petrie would like
you to come over...

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:40.165
and present an autographed
album to Aunt Gretel.

01:02:40.637 --> 01:02:42.832
Sure. Anytime l can
put a little sunshine...

01:02:42.906 --> 01:02:44.840
into the life of
the little people, you know?

01:02:44.908 --> 01:02:48.605
Carla, honey,
what do l have to give you
to get a little kiss?

01:02:49.546 --> 01:02:50.535
Chloroform.

01:02:50.613 --> 01:02:51.602
Oh!

01:02:52.382 --> 01:02:54.316
Carla? Hi.
Hi.

01:02:54.384 --> 01:02:56.750
Look, l'm sorry
to interrupt--
Then, why are you?

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.517
Be nice, Johnny.
Right, especially
to the less fortunate.

01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:04.485
Templeton Peck,
this is Johnny Angel.

01:03:05.095 --> 01:03:08.758
Johnny Angel. l like it.
Most people do.

01:03:09.132 --> 01:03:11.862
Look, Carla,
l was just wondering...

01:03:11.935 --> 01:03:14.495
l saw a motor launch
let some people off
on the boat.

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:17.039
Yes, a Mr. Scarlatti
and his party.

01:03:17.107 --> 01:03:18.369
Mr. Scarlatti.

01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:20.875
Yes, l guess they missed
the boat back at Palermo...

01:03:20.944 --> 01:03:23.708
so the captain sent
a motor launch
to bring him out.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.614
He's in the presidential suite
on C deck.
Thanks.

01:03:30.954 --> 01:03:32.945
Why do you look at him
like that? What is he?

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:34.315
Cute.

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:37.286
[chuckling]

01:03:39.562 --> 01:03:41.894
Hey, baby,
come win the taste test.

01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:46.402
Someone had to have seen them.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.534
lf not the girl, then
one of those four scungillis
who grabbed her.

01:03:51.608 --> 01:03:53.405
l'll check with
the purser's office.

01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:56.138
Find out about the persons
who got on board at Palermo.

01:03:56.279 --> 01:03:58.713
l just want to know
they're on board.

01:03:58.781 --> 01:04:02.444
lf they're here,
then she is here.
And l want her dead.

01:04:03.086 --> 01:04:05.554
lf l have to, l'll blow up
the whole damn ship.

01:04:05.622 --> 01:04:07.715
l got less than 24 hours.

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:09.815
l promise each
and everyone here...

01:04:10.527 --> 01:04:12.256
if my brother
gets convicted...

01:04:12.929 --> 01:04:15.659
l'll cut your hearts out
and mail them to him.

01:04:16.065 --> 01:04:18.829
Now, find that girl
and kill her.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:24.772
[speaking in ltalian]

01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:53.231
Don't you worry, my brother.

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.097
Don't you worry.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:12.506
How did you get in here?
l'm sorry.
l was looking for C-61 .

01:06:15.084 --> 01:06:18.542
Would you look there?
''E-61,'' wrong deck.

01:06:19.088 --> 01:06:20.988
l'm the ship's doctor, l....

01:06:21.057 --> 01:06:25.221
Somebody reported
a very bad case of
seasickness, so l'll just....

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:27.894
Do l look seasick to you,
Doctor?

01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:30.993
No, no, actually you look....

01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:37.536
Perhaps, you could take
a very deep breath and....

01:06:38.508 --> 01:06:39.497
[moaning]

01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:49.782
l'm sorry. Look,
l can explain. lt's just--
l understand.

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:52.953
You do?
lt happens wherever l go.

01:06:53.623 --> 01:06:55.284
Men just can seem to
stay away from me.

01:06:55.358 --> 01:06:56.916
lt must be
a terrible burden.

01:06:56.993 --> 01:06:59.393
Especially with my boyfriend
being so jealous.

01:06:59.462 --> 01:07:02.488
Yes, well, l do recall...

01:07:02.565 --> 01:07:04.863
having to tell
someone something....

01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:08.103
You know, Bull does his laps
every day until 3:00.

01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:10.867
Bull?
That's just what
his friends call him.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.567
Arnold Bulinsky is his name.
''Bull'' for short.

01:07:13.876 --> 01:07:16.572
l see.
For a minute there l thought
that was because he was...

01:07:16.646 --> 01:07:19.137
you know, built.

01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:24.009
Yes, until 3:00, huh? Right.

01:07:24.987 --> 01:07:27.455
l really do have to
tell someone something...

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:31.221
very, very, important.

01:07:35.031 --> 01:07:36.123
[exclaiming]

01:07:36.199 --> 01:07:38.929
Kitty!
Thank God.
Quick, quick, some water.

01:07:39.068 --> 01:07:40.660
What are you doing?

01:07:40.737 --> 01:07:42.762
What am l doing?
What do you think l'm doing?

01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:44.101
l'm trying to
bring her around.

01:07:44.173 --> 01:07:45.800
[moaning]
Now quick, the water, move.

01:07:49.345 --> 01:07:52.178
Hey, the water.
Thanks.

01:07:53.049 --> 01:07:54.676
Here.
Maybe you better sit up.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:56.316
Easy, easy.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.048
Sip it. Nice and slow.

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.052
Would you.... Thanks.

01:08:04.127 --> 01:08:07.119
Now, if you'll just lie back.
There you go.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:10.993
Oh, boy, your pulse feels
like a trip hammer.

01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:12.295
No kidding.

01:08:12.368 --> 01:08:14.893
What happened, honey?
Bull, l don't know.

01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:18.031
Well, l just found her
lying on the floor there.

01:08:18.107 --> 01:08:20.439
l mean, luckily l was
on the wrong deck, you know.

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:23.877
Someone recorded
a very bad case of halitosis.

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:27.077
So, l came
to the wrong deck...

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:30.381
and l just happened
to spot Miss....

01:08:30.685 --> 01:08:33.120
Tremayne.
Miss Tremayne.
But of course....

01:08:33.555 --> 01:08:37.993
Anyway, l don't think you've
hit your head or sustained
any concussion or anything...

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.721
but l just suggest you take it
easy for a day or two...

01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:44.028
and you know,
don't push....

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.761
What caused it?
Maybe she's ill?

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:49.803
No. lt's just your typical
case of, uh, anatonia...

01:08:50.238 --> 01:08:52.366
caused by a shift
in the currents
in lower latitudes.

01:08:52.442 --> 01:08:55.934
Perhaps you've been
experiencing some
of these symptoms.

01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:57.477
[groaning]

01:08:58.381 --> 01:09:01.247
l'm as fit as a horse.
Of course you are.

01:09:01.584 --> 01:09:04.144
[moaning]
l've been telling you to
stay more in shape, babe.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.550
ls there anything else
that l need, Doctor?

01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:10.984
Well, yes. l think you should
take a nap
in the afternoons...

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:13.859
whenever you feel the need.

01:09:17.433 --> 01:09:18.421

Anything you ladies need?

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:46.685
Towels, suntan lotion.
Suntan lotion--

01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:48.854
Yo, boy,
where's that towel, huh?

01:09:49.799 --> 01:09:53.234
As l said, anything you need,
feel free to call--

01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:55.202
What are you doing,
knitting the lousy thing?

01:09:55.938 --> 01:09:57.200
Excuse me.

01:09:57.273 --> 01:10:00.401
Where's the drink?
l ordered another drink
over 10 minutes ago.

01:10:02.445 --> 01:10:06.506
Johnny, did anyone ever
tell you that you got
one set of lousy manners?

01:10:06.782 --> 01:10:08.249
Certainly not a towel boy...

01:10:08.317 --> 01:10:10.717
and nobody calls me Johnny
without my say-so.

01:10:12.355 --> 01:10:14.516
Hey, she can have my say-so.

01:10:14.824 --> 01:10:16.086
Let me tell you something.

01:10:16.158 --> 01:10:19.059
But l like to let
the little people off
with the first offense...

01:10:19.128 --> 01:10:20.789
especially when
they're my name-sake.

01:10:21.697 --> 01:10:25.030
But next time you'll be
paddling back to Capri
on a rubber horsie.

01:10:25.501 --> 01:10:29.164
So, get me that towel
and find me that cold drink.

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:32.532
And maybe if you bring around
a date after my show...

01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:34.371
l'll mention your name
on the mike.

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:38.105
See, it guarantees extra tips
when you're tight
with The Angel.

01:10:47.123 --> 01:10:49.182
You know, Face,
l really like this
job you got me...

01:10:49.258 --> 01:10:51.158
but l may have to
go to the lounge soon...

01:10:51.227 --> 01:10:55.027
because that guy Angel is
going fishing very shortly--

01:10:55.097 --> 01:10:57.964
lxnay that, Hannibal,
we got real trouble.

01:10:58.167 --> 01:11:00.067
That launch that took off
on the side of ship?

01:11:00.136 --> 01:11:02.969
Right. Left the entire cast
of The Cotton Club behind.

01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:06.073
We'd better get out of sight.
l'll get B.A. and Murdock.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:09.006
See if you can spring
Lori from Jaws.

01:11:10.746 --> 01:11:12.611
Say cheeks, all right.
Here we go.

01:11:12.882 --> 01:11:14.179
[camera clicking]

01:11:15.084 --> 01:11:17.678
You better get below deck.
What's going on?

01:11:17.753 --> 01:11:20.313
Hey, Kildare, why don't you go
peddle your aspirin elsewhere?

01:11:20.389 --> 01:11:22.687
You better get below deck,
you see, you'll....

01:11:22.758 --> 01:11:26.285
Yeah, you're absolutely
H-positive skin type.
Now, now....

01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:29.761
l'll stop by
with the liniment.

01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:32.096
Hey, what cabin can l
deliver the photos to?

01:11:32.168 --> 01:11:33.931
That's all right.
l'll see that she gets it.

01:11:34.003 --> 01:11:36.471
Liniment? Where do you guys
come up with these raps?

01:11:36.539 --> 01:11:38.939
Well, you pick them up
in very short order
around here.

01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:41.142
[camera clicking]
Say cheeks.

01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:48.405
[whooping]

01:11:48.484 --> 01:11:51.385
All right, all right,
that's a definite
upward trend...

01:11:51.454 --> 01:11:53.012
for members of the black team.

01:11:53.089 --> 01:11:54.716
l want to get out of here,
Murdock.

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:58.191
All right, B.A., just cool.
This is all part
of the disguise.

01:11:58.461 --> 01:12:01.396
l mean, old crotchety people
love to play shuffleboard.

01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:04.490
l said l want to
go downstairs.
l want to go to my cabin.

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:07.092
All right. Well,
you can't just get up
and walk, all right?

01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:10.297
You're gonna have to
sit down and you gonna have to
enjoy this game of skill.

01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:11.465
l want to go down.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:16.273
Well, you can't.
Not until your nurse,
and that is moi, says you can.

01:12:18.014 --> 01:12:20.482
You gonna take me
downstairs now or
l'm gonna give you...

01:12:20.549 --> 01:12:22.744
the worst case of ring around
the collar you ever saw.

01:12:22.818 --> 01:12:25.252
B.A., put Murdock down,
get back in your chair...

01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:27.721
and meet me
in your cabin right away.

01:12:28.024 --> 01:12:29.389
[Murdock panting]

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:32.894
Not bad, especially when
you put my neck in
the U of that hook.

01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:34.987
l was just trying to teach you
how to have a good time...

01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:37.794
when you grow up to be
an old lady, because make
no doubt about it...

01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:39.459
when you're 45
you're gonna be
wearing a drip...

01:12:39.535 --> 01:12:41.127
and ain't nobody's gonna
wanna dance with you.

01:12:41.203 --> 01:12:44.138
Are you absolutely sure
that it's Scarlatti?

01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:46.834
Well, some faces make
an indelible impression,
you know.

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.900
Especially when you see them
for the first time...

01:12:48.978 --> 01:12:50.343
over the barrel
of a machine gun.

01:12:50.413 --> 01:12:51.937
How many men
did he have with him?

01:12:52.014 --> 01:12:53.606
lt was like the Volkswagen
at the circus.

01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:56.550
Guys just kept coming out,
each one bigger than the next.

01:12:56.619 --> 01:12:58.951
l ran into four of 'em
just trying to find you guys.

01:12:59.021 --> 01:13:02.115
The first thing
they'll do is to check
the ship's registry.

01:13:02.324 --> 01:13:05.521
Find out how many cabins
we took after we sailed
from Palermo.

01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:08.495
Lori, don't go back
to your cabin. Stay here.

01:13:08.564 --> 01:13:09.724
(B.A.)
Stay here?

01:13:09.799 --> 01:13:13.530
Hannibal, we all can't stay
cooped up in the same cabin
for two weeks.

01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:16.799
B.A., there are more of them
than there are of us.

01:13:16.972 --> 01:13:19.167
Besides,
we don't have any weapons
that we can conceal.

01:13:19.241 --> 01:13:20.708
We'll have to
thin them out a little.

01:13:20.776 --> 01:13:23.677
l don't understand.
l mean, if there are
so many of them...

01:13:23.746 --> 01:13:25.509
what can you do
if they're all armed?

01:13:25.581 --> 01:13:28.414
Cut down the odds.
Take some of
the other side out.

01:13:28.484 --> 01:13:30.679
We'll run across
a couple of guns
along the way.

01:13:30.753 --> 01:13:33.449
lf we start roaming
around the ship,
they're gonna recognize us.

01:13:33.522 --> 01:13:35.649
We could all move
around freely...

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.794
if we were all in disguise.

01:13:41.831 --> 01:13:43.321
(Carla)
A costume party?

01:13:43.632 --> 01:13:47.124
Everybody who's come
to see me, which is half
the people on this boat....

01:13:47.203 --> 01:13:51.299
Ship, has said,
''What about a costume party?''

01:13:51.774 --> 01:13:54.538
l've been a cruise director
for four years now...

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:56.976
and l've never heard
of a costume party.

01:13:57.046 --> 01:13:58.980
Really?
They went out
with hula hoops.

01:13:59.048 --> 01:14:02.040
Well, half the people
on this cruise
went out with hula hoops.

01:14:02.118 --> 01:14:04.382
Yeah, that's the trouble
with cruises today.

01:14:04.453 --> 01:14:07.149
l mean, why get rid of
a good thing, you know?

01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:09.316
l can't believe that
many people asked about one.

01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:10.949
Are you kidding? Oh, sure.

01:14:11.026 --> 01:14:13.756
l mean, all kinds of people
have been coming up to me.

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:17.162
You see, the best costume
gets to sit at the captain's
table for dinner.

01:14:17.233 --> 01:14:20.134
lt's an old custom.
l'm surprised
you haven't heard of it.

01:14:20.469 --> 01:14:22.562
Yeah,
even the captain was saying--
The Captain?

01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:25.038
Yeah, By the way,
l love this scarf.

01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:28.372
Yeah, l was giving
the Captain a shot
in his cabin, B-1 2.

01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:32.207
And he was saying how much
he missed the good
old days. So l said--

01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:36.115
No costume party was
mentioned when people
signed up for the cruise.

01:14:36.185 --> 01:14:38.016
Yeah, but--
No one has any costumes.

01:14:38.087 --> 01:14:40.817
That's half the fun.
You get to create
your own costume.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:43.984
You really don't know
anything about this, do you?
lt's amazing.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.860
Are you trying to do
my job for me or something?

01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:48.954
No, please,
No, l....
No?

01:14:54.403 --> 01:14:56.803
That doctor,
he gets more action....

01:15:03.546 --> 01:15:06.913
Look, l'm sorry.
l don't know
what came over me.

01:15:08.484 --> 01:15:10.975
You've never done anything
like that before?

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:12.816
No, no.
No.

01:15:12.922 --> 01:15:15.584
lt's kind of hard
to explain. You see--

01:15:15.658 --> 01:15:18.354
A costume party, huh?
Yeah.

01:15:18.594 --> 01:15:19.686
Yeah?

01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:41.842
Come on.
Shut up, fool.

01:15:42.451 --> 01:15:44.612
Please, B.A., please.

01:15:44.854 --> 01:15:46.981
(B.A.)
l said, no. And no is no.

01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:48.551
What's going on?

01:15:49.024 --> 01:15:52.187
Well, l have nothing to wear.
l mean l have absolutely
nothing to wear.

01:15:52.261 --> 01:15:55.662
l asked him if l could
borrow those delicious
feathered earrings?

01:15:55.731 --> 01:15:57.596
He's not even going
to that party today...

01:15:57.666 --> 01:16:00.897
and he said no.
Do you know why?
Because he is jealous.

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:03.368
That's why.
Because l'll get a date.

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.134
Perhaps l would be
the first to marry...

01:16:05.207 --> 01:16:08.734
and mine will be
the first-born male child
on the A-Team.

01:16:08.878 --> 01:16:11.108
And he just couldn't
have that, could he?

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:14.240
Little tuck
here and there, you know.

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:17.450
Gold braid...

01:16:18.287 --> 01:16:19.720
on the shoulder...

01:16:19.922 --> 01:16:22.516
toy sword and voila!

01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:24.525
Charge Of The Light Brigade.

01:16:24.727 --> 01:16:27.025
Well, that's it, then.
l mean that's it.

01:16:27.096 --> 01:16:28.461
All the good
costumes are gone.

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.020
Where does that
leave me then?

01:16:30.099 --> 01:16:33.466
Hey, you can sit on Face's lap
and go as Jerry Mahoney.

01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:37.071

How inventive!

the cleverness,
the ingenuity of it.

today's contest.

No weapons, Murdock?
You looking for these?

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:15.859
Oh.

01:18:16.972 --> 01:18:18.098

for this world, Hannibal.

l'm not sure
he was ever in it.

01:18:37.626 --> 01:18:39.617
Yeah! Is everybody
having a good time?

for this guy.

Carla!

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.174
Carla,
this was a brilliant idea.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.912
Of all the cruise directors
that l've worked
with before...

01:19:03.986 --> 01:19:07.444
l was wondering who was gonna
pull this one out of the trunk
and dust it off.

01:19:07.523 --> 01:19:09.991
You really are special.
Like me.

01:19:10.526 --> 01:19:13.984

two special people--
ls one too many.

the costume party, huh?

A bunch of grown-ups
runnin' around, dressed
for Halloween?

unnatural. l mean,
what do you call this?

l'm a class act
direct from Vegas.

lt says, ''Johnny Angel,
the King of Croon.''

01:19:36.452 --> 01:19:39.512
Right about now,
l'd be into the Sinatra set.

01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:41.715
Doing Strangers In the Night
or My Way...

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:44.122
which is old Blue-Eyes'
favorite the way l do it.

01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:47.924
l end the show off with
some Volare, which usually
brings the house down.

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.328
l'm out here playing
Monty Hall to a couple
of cucumber sandwiches...

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.560
from Keokuk Falls.

01:19:52.634 --> 01:19:53.931
Well, hang in there, Johnny.

01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:55.560
Remember,
it's all in good fun...

01:19:55.637 --> 01:19:57.696
and l hear you're
into having fun.

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:02.838
[[[singing Volare]

01:20:15.924 --> 01:20:19.382
What do you think?
l am the ghost
of Christmas future.

01:20:20.095 --> 01:20:22.086
You see what happened
to the guy who was with me?

01:20:22.564 --> 01:20:24.122
Too much punch.

01:20:35.144 --> 01:20:36.975
(Carla)
Everyone's having
a good time.

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:39.013
l never would have
believed this.

01:20:50.492 --> 01:20:53.188
Got two .25 automatic,
Hannibal, and one extra clip.

01:20:53.262 --> 01:20:56.390
With this P38
what Face can get us,
we should be all right.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.628
We got to find him.
l'll take the upper deck.

01:21:00.702 --> 01:21:03.193
l'll check
if you'd like, Colonel.
lt's a heck of a party.

01:21:03.272 --> 01:21:04.967
You got to
check it out, too, B.A.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.166
l'll lend you my sheet.

01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:10.970
Everybody having a good time?

01:21:11.079 --> 01:21:12.239
[laughing]

01:21:12.748 --> 01:21:13.806
(Johnny)
You got it!

01:21:13.882 --> 01:21:15.713
[people chattering]

01:21:49.117 --> 01:21:51.085
l thought we could....
Well....

01:21:51.753 --> 01:21:52.879
[moaning]

01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:56.755
Look, l have a patient
in traction and l have to
look in on her.

01:21:56.825 --> 01:21:57.985
Really.

01:22:15.244 --> 01:22:17.508
Kitty, what, what--

01:22:17.579 --> 01:22:20.377
Doctor, l'm feeling
sick again. l think
l need mouth to mouth.

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:24.545
Yeah, l really do have
a patient in traction
that l have to look in on.

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.383
The traction is not
going anywhere.

01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:27.914
l knew it!

01:22:28.824 --> 01:22:29.916
How dare you?

01:22:29.992 --> 01:22:30.981
[groaning]

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:32.986
l knew it.

01:22:37.933 --> 01:22:38.991
[grunting]

01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:43.329
[gasping]

01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:45.266
What did you do to him?

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.069
What do you mean,
what did l do to him?

01:22:47.142 --> 01:22:48.837
He tried to kill me,
for cryin' out aloud.

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:51.208
He was trying to protect me.
You're right.

01:22:55.984 --> 01:22:57.246
No mask.

01:23:01.156 --> 01:23:02.145
[groaning]

01:23:17.105 --> 01:23:18.197
[groaning]

01:23:24.212 --> 01:23:25.941
Put him down, pal.

01:23:27.182 --> 01:23:28.171
Oh....

01:23:39.261 --> 01:23:40.250
[gasping]

01:23:47.202 --> 01:23:48.191
[coughing]

01:23:49.838 --> 01:23:51.999
How very charming.

01:23:55.577 --> 01:23:57.204
That's her.
Si.

01:23:57.279 --> 01:23:58.268
[door opening]

01:23:58.547 --> 01:24:01.015
What do you call this?
What are you guys
doing in my room?

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:02.675
That's a very pretty girl...

01:24:03.018 --> 01:24:04.815
and obviously
a good friend of yours.

01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:07.087
All pretty girls are
good friends of mine...

01:24:07.155 --> 01:24:09.680
but that still don't
give you guys the right
to break into my room.

01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.282
Perhaps this does, hmm?

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.723
ls everybody around here
going crazy?

01:24:13.929 --> 01:24:15.590
You guys know
who you're messing with?

01:24:15.664 --> 01:24:18.326
l open for Ol' Blue-Eyes
when he plays Tahoe.

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:21.129
What, wait a minute.
Where is she?

01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:28.806
Now get hold of the Captain.

01:24:28.877 --> 01:24:31.505
Tell him to get
the authorities out here
to arrest these jokers.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.639
My baby.
He'll be fine, believe me.

01:24:35.016 --> 01:24:36.449
[groaning]
Here's a little present
for you.

01:24:36.518 --> 01:24:39.043
That fish you caught
don't have any scales.

01:24:39.454 --> 01:24:41.422
Have a nice swim, Lieutenant?

01:24:42.524 --> 01:24:45.288
Now, we got
everybody except Scarlatti
and his lieutenant, right?

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.384
Right.

01:24:46.728 --> 01:24:48.059
Let's go get him.

01:24:49.998 --> 01:24:51.056
[women screaming]

01:24:53.802 --> 01:24:55.201
[screaming]

01:24:58.407 --> 01:25:00.398
Drop your weapons, now!

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.904
l think we have
a first-prize winner here:
''Best Gangster.''

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:13.350
Now, or we sending
this little girl home
to Papa in a shoebox!

01:25:13.755 --> 01:25:15.620
Too many innocent bystanders.

01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:17.920
lt's his call, guys.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.961
(Captain)
This is M.S. Tropicale
calling...

01:25:27.035 --> 01:25:28.900
the Italian coast guard
station at Palermo.

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:30.528
The ship is under siege.

01:25:30.605 --> 01:25:32.368
Armed gunmen are
aboard the ship.

01:25:32.441 --> 01:25:35.342
We are 38 degrees,
20. 10 minutes north...

01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:38.140
and 10 degrees
06.30 minutes east.

01:25:38.213 --> 01:25:39.976
We need immediate assistance.

01:25:47.222 --> 01:25:48.382
[woman screaming]

01:25:49.524 --> 01:25:50.650
Let's go.

01:26:08.477 --> 01:26:09.876
Now remember...

01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:13.841
anybody who sticks their
nose out gets it shot off.

01:26:25.627 --> 01:26:27.527
Mr. Scarlatti,
everything is under control.

01:26:27.596 --> 01:26:29.291
Get the Captain's
launch lowered.

01:26:29.364 --> 01:26:32.993
Bernie, Rico,
you take care of
these gentlemen.

01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:35.701
Come on, let's go.

01:26:37.305 --> 01:26:38.499
(Lori)
What do you want?

01:26:38.573 --> 01:26:41.667
You and l have some business
to discuss, family business.

01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:44.303
My brother and your father.

01:26:59.394 --> 01:27:00.383
[grunting]

01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:03.393
No, wait!
Help!

01:27:04.866 --> 01:27:06.333
Murdock....

01:27:11.273 --> 01:27:12.638
lt's all right.
l got him.

01:27:33.728 --> 01:27:34.854
Please....

01:27:35.764 --> 01:27:37.664
Please don't hurt my friends.

01:27:50.779 --> 01:27:54.078
l'll do anything.
Anything you want.
Of course you will.

01:27:54.349 --> 01:27:56.283
Of course
you'll do anything l want.

01:27:56.551 --> 01:27:59.577
You realize
what kind of difficulties
you put me through?

01:28:11.866 --> 01:28:14.835
Don't you realize
it's too late? Huh?

01:28:15.704 --> 01:28:17.501
You're worried
about hurting people?

01:28:17.806 --> 01:28:20.934
Why you take me
around the floor
with this tarantella?

01:28:21.142 --> 01:28:24.737
Now l got to blow up this ship
with all these witnesses.

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.039
[gun cocking]
God, no, not all these
innocent people.

01:28:27.115 --> 01:28:29.083
Life can be unfair, no?

01:28:31.553 --> 01:28:34.522
But what we got to do
is call up your father...

01:28:35.123 --> 01:28:37.614
you tell him
what l say you to tell him.

01:28:37.993 --> 01:28:41.554
Or things will go
from bad to worse,
in no time at all.

Captain. What do you say?

Do you want to see
why we just swam...

01:31:04.906 --> 01:31:07.306
200 yards to get you?

01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:09.343
Look at this. Look.
