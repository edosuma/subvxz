WEBVTT

00:03.687 --> 00:06.589
Katia,
put your coat on now!

00:06.657 --> 00:07.881
Never!

00:07.949 --> 00:09.578
Chloe,
this is so not funny.

00:09.646 --> 00:11.340
Hey, I came to return this.

00:14.407 --> 00:16.703
What's up?

00:16.771 --> 00:17.803
The box?

00:17.871 --> 00:21.211
Michael sent it from
California.

00:21.279 --> 00:23.612
- Candy.
- Exactly.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.878
- How much have they eaten?
- Oh...

00:28.645 --> 00:31.345
Pfft!

00:31.412 --> 00:35.913
Okay, my day is ballet class,
piano lessons,

00:35.981 --> 00:37.714
breakfast, lunch
and a fresh

00:37.782 --> 00:39.017
farm-to-table dinner
for the kids.

00:39.084 --> 00:41.487
Michael's contribution
to this day?

00:41.555 --> 00:43.122
- Candy.
- You know what?

00:43.189 --> 00:44.790
Why don't I take this
to the Smithsonian,

00:44.857 --> 00:46.324
and I'm sure
the guys there--

00:46.392 --> 00:47.892
Wait I thought the Smithsonian
was just some fake, made-up job

00:47.960 --> 00:49.294
for the CIA.

00:49.362 --> 00:51.331
Oh, no, it's definitely
a real made-up job.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.200
It's what they call
a non-official cover.

00:54.268 --> 00:56.137
So occasionally I have
to do some actual work there

00:56.204 --> 00:57.538
to keep up appearances.

00:57.606 --> 00:59.974
You work at the Smithsonian,
you work at the CIA,

01:00.042 --> 01:01.109
you work at both?

01:01.177 --> 01:02.378
I know.
It's crazy, right?

01:02.445 --> 01:05.346
Mwah!

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.089 --> 01:53.557
Miss, excuse me.

01:53.625 --> 01:56.560
Is this yours?

01:56.628 --> 01:59.362
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.742
Hello, Annie.

02:14.810 --> 02:16.712
It's nice
to finally meet you.

02:16.779 --> 02:19.347
My name's Kenneth Martin.

02:19.415 --> 02:22.450
Skittle?

02:22.518 --> 02:24.886
It's from your stash.

02:24.953 --> 02:28.357
Mm.

02:28.425 --> 02:30.259
Is there a reason
why you lifted my wallet?

02:30.327 --> 02:31.594
And my candy?

02:31.661 --> 02:33.896
I wanted to see
if I could get your attention.

02:33.964 --> 02:35.165
Why?

02:35.232 --> 02:37.267
Well, think of it
like an aptitude test.

02:37.334 --> 02:40.103
You passed brilliantly
by the way.

02:45.744 --> 02:47.945
What if
I called the police?

02:48.013 --> 02:49.046
Heh.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.181
After you
left the museum

02:50.248 --> 02:52.783
you passed
two Smithsonian guards,

02:52.851 --> 02:56.988
two park rangers
and a DC bobby.

02:57.056 --> 02:58.589
I would have known
if you'd called the police.

02:58.657 --> 03:00.058
I might still
call the police.

03:00.126 --> 03:02.727
Oh.

03:02.795 --> 03:04.829
What do you want?

03:04.897 --> 03:06.031
You have a job
at the Smithsonian

03:06.098 --> 03:06.865
which allows you
to travel the world

03:06.933 --> 03:09.100
without suspicion.

03:09.168 --> 03:11.903
You know multiple languages.

03:11.971 --> 03:13.505
And you're bold enough
to meet a complete stranger

03:13.572 --> 03:14.906
in the park

03:14.973 --> 03:17.775
just because he left
a note in your wallet.

03:23.681 --> 03:27.150
I work for
the British government.

03:27.218 --> 03:28.618
We'd like
to offer you a job.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.087
What kind of job?

03:31.154 --> 03:34.357
I'm with MI6.

03:34.425 --> 03:37.727
British Secret Service.

03:37.795 --> 03:39.696
I don't understand.
I thought we had an agreement

03:39.763 --> 03:40.797
with the British
that we don't recruit

03:40.865 --> 03:42.465
their citizens
without permission.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.501
Yup, we do,
but in the spy game

03:44.568 --> 03:45.502
agreements are made
to be broken.

03:45.569 --> 03:46.803
What does UK desk have?

03:46.871 --> 03:48.739
Martin's passport
is British government.

03:48.806 --> 03:51.408
His official employer
is "Shining Seas Imports."

03:51.476 --> 03:53.744
A known MI6 front company.

03:53.811 --> 03:56.680
- So he's legit.
- Yes and no.

03:56.747 --> 03:59.015
He doesn't exactly fit
a typical MI6 profile.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.584
Working class family,
a few scrapes with the law

04:01.652 --> 04:02.785
when he was a kid.

04:02.853 --> 04:04.620
He didn't even
graduate high school.

04:04.688 --> 04:07.656
MI6 is an old boys club
comprised of squeaky clean

04:07.724 --> 04:10.993
Cambridge grads,
that doesn't add up.

04:11.060 --> 04:13.328
Annie,
tell me about the pitch.

04:13.396 --> 04:14.730
It was smart.

04:14.798 --> 04:16.065
He did his homework,
he knew exactly

04:16.132 --> 04:17.399
which buttons to push.

04:17.468 --> 04:18.601
It's just the way
I would have done it.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.101
And what was
your impression of him?

04:20.170 --> 04:21.704
Personally?

04:21.772 --> 04:25.208
Intelligent, capable,

04:25.275 --> 04:29.079
interesting.

04:29.147 --> 04:30.547
I want you
to accept his offer.

04:30.615 --> 04:31.915
You want me
to be a double Agent?

04:31.983 --> 04:32.850
We don't even know
if this is real.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.585
It doesn't matter.

04:34.653 --> 04:35.986
We have a potential
MI6 operative

04:36.054 --> 04:39.122
nosing around the Smithsonian,
and I want to know why.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.190
Annie Walker.

04:41.258 --> 04:43.192
Welcome to
her Majesty's Secret Service.

I haven't said
I'm gonna do it yet.

05:49.173 --> 05:50.273
Well, if you
were gonna say no

05:50.341 --> 05:56.380
you wouldn't have come.

05:56.448 --> 05:58.516
All the beautiful monuments
in DC, you have to pick

05:58.583 --> 06:00.585
the one with
the unsightly renovation?

06:00.653 --> 06:01.820
Well, the noise
from the skid loaders

06:01.888 --> 06:04.889
makes it hard
for anyone to record us.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.258
Skid loaders?

06:07.326 --> 06:10.328
My father
paved most of the A5.

06:10.396 --> 06:11.763
I spent three years
on a road crew

06:11.831 --> 06:13.564
before I joined MI6.

06:13.632 --> 06:15.400
So you're
a working class James Bond?

06:16.903 --> 06:18.638
Well, some lads dreamed
of being a fireman

06:18.705 --> 06:20.172
or a policeman.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.340
I wanted to be a spy.

06:21.408 --> 06:22.975
See the world.

06:23.043 --> 06:24.743
Make a difference
for the Crown.

06:24.811 --> 06:26.678
Heh.

06:26.746 --> 06:28.914
I wasn't like
other lads before.

06:28.981 --> 06:31.349
And I'm still not.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.985
Bit of a romantic
for a spy, aren't you?

06:35.053 --> 06:37.955
And why do you think
I chose you?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.456
In my job you
spend a lot of time

06:39.524 --> 06:42.759
trying to figure out
what makes people tick.

06:42.827 --> 06:45.696
I had your number
the moment I laid eyes on you.

06:45.764 --> 06:48.132
Really?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.635
Two years
doing humanitarian work.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.239
Backpacking in Sri Lanka,
Egypt, Easter island.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.907
Admit it.

06:55.975 --> 06:59.278
You're just as much
of a romantic as me.

06:59.346 --> 07:02.748
Does MI6 have
some kind of file on me?

07:02.816 --> 07:04.183
Actually, I got it
from your bio

07:04.251 --> 07:08.621
on the Smithsonian website.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.689
So...

07:10.757 --> 07:15.127
Down to brass tacks,
shall we?

07:15.195 --> 07:18.230
He's an art restorer
at your museum.

07:18.298 --> 07:21.066
I want you to get me
his appointment schedule.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.568
I want to take a look
around his studio.

07:23.636 --> 07:27.038
Why?

07:27.106 --> 07:30.041
First lesson
in the world of espionage.

07:30.109 --> 07:35.278
Information's on
a need to know basis.

07:35.346 --> 07:36.613
Karim Bichri.

07:36.681 --> 07:38.714
Renowned art restorer.

07:38.782 --> 07:39.915
Has worked
in some of the most

07:39.983 --> 07:42.018
prestigious museums
in the world.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.586
He is currently finishing up
a one-month stint

07:43.654 --> 07:45.289
at the Smithsonian.

07:45.356 --> 07:46.757
Bichri's never been involved
with politics

07:46.824 --> 07:48.826
or causes of any kind.

07:48.894 --> 07:50.027
Andy, I want you
to help Martin

07:50.095 --> 07:51.796
get into the studio.

07:51.864 --> 07:53.397
You want me
to help a foreign operative

07:53.465 --> 07:54.832
break into the Smithsonian?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.402
I want you to find out
what Martin's after.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.404
In the meantime,
I'm gonna pay MI6

07:59.472 --> 08:01.707
a little visit.

08:01.775 --> 08:04.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going, Moneypenny?

08:04.311 --> 08:06.947
Double Agent means
double the paperwork.

08:07.014 --> 08:09.750
And added bonus,
you don't get to keep

08:09.817 --> 08:12.720
any of the money
MI6 is paying you.

08:12.787 --> 08:15.656
Enjoy.

08:30.237 --> 08:32.672
I could have called that,
your stance was way off.

08:34.006 --> 08:36.275
My stance is sound,
the wind took it.

08:36.342 --> 08:38.243
You keep
telling yourself that.

08:38.311 --> 08:39.778
You seem
to be full of excuses.

08:39.846 --> 08:41.044
Here we go.

08:41.113 --> 08:42.712
What'd I do this time?

08:42.780 --> 08:44.482
It's not what you've done.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.284
It's what you haven't.

08:46.352 --> 08:48.019
And you're here
to give me advice.

08:48.086 --> 08:49.654
No.

08:49.721 --> 08:52.390
I've given you advice before.
For years.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.626
You always seem
to take it as an affront.

08:58.129 --> 09:00.998
Do you remember when I told you
to choke up in little league?

09:01.066 --> 09:02.633
- No, I don't remember that.
- Mm, well...

09:02.701 --> 09:04.568
It seems you're
not the kind of guy

09:04.636 --> 09:07.405
who can get in front
of a fastball.

09:12.445 --> 09:13.912
What's this?

09:13.980 --> 09:15.447
Take it as a favor.

09:15.515 --> 09:20.219
It's a dormant operation
called "ministry."

09:20.287 --> 09:22.255
And well worth your while
to pursue it.

09:22.322 --> 09:24.356
You could be a hero
on this one.

09:24.424 --> 09:27.926
What makes you feel--

09:27.993 --> 09:29.327
I get it.

09:29.395 --> 09:32.630
I was a lousy father.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.465
Maybe you think
I still am.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.266
But I do know Langley.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.836
And I want you
to realize this.

09:38.903 --> 09:41.905
At the CIA,
you get a very small window

09:41.972 --> 09:43.372
to prove yourself.

09:43.440 --> 09:48.611
And I fear
yours is closing.

09:48.679 --> 09:51.380
I'm trying to help you.

10:20.206 --> 10:22.374
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Karim Bichri.

10:22.442 --> 10:24.476
I wouldn't go in there
if I was you.

10:24.544 --> 10:26.279
He's working.

10:26.346 --> 10:29.916
I'll just be a second.

10:29.984 --> 10:32.853
Your funeral.

10:39.028 --> 10:41.830
Excuse me, Mr. Bichri?

10:41.897 --> 10:45.133
My name is--
- Did you bring my lunch?

10:45.201 --> 10:47.602
- What?
- My lunch.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.371
No, I'm with
the acquisitions department--

10:49.439 --> 10:52.508
Then go away.

10:52.576 --> 10:55.711
Mr. Bichri, the museum
is courting an important patron

10:55.779 --> 10:58.080
and we'd like to arrange
a tour of your studio.

10:58.147 --> 10:59.414
I was hoping
I could get a look

10:59.482 --> 11:00.749
at your appointment schedule
so we could--

11:00.816 --> 11:03.685
Do you know
what this is?

11:03.753 --> 11:05.386
It's one of
the 20 <i>Thinker</i> sculptures

11:05.454 --> 11:06.888
by Auguste Rodin.

11:06.956 --> 11:09.525
It's one
of the greatest sculptures

11:09.592 --> 11:12.861
by one of the greatest artists
of all time.

11:12.929 --> 11:15.364
It returns to Frankfurt
in two days.

11:15.431 --> 11:16.465
What do you think
is more important,

11:16.532 --> 11:21.703
this or your little tour?

11:21.771 --> 11:23.471
Mr. Bichri,
I've admired your work

11:23.539 --> 11:25.006
for many years.

11:25.074 --> 11:28.076
What you did on the facade
of the Duomo in Milan,

11:28.143 --> 11:29.744
and the fissure work
on the tendrils

11:29.812 --> 11:31.746
in Bernini's <i>Medusa</i>
were miraculous.

11:31.814 --> 11:33.114
Oh, Ms. Walker...

11:33.182 --> 11:36.117
Heh, do you really think
that's going to work?

11:36.185 --> 11:40.221
Appealing to my vanity?

11:40.289 --> 11:42.490
Was there something else?

11:42.558 --> 11:44.025
Lunch, Karim.

11:44.092 --> 11:45.393
Finally.

11:45.460 --> 11:49.964
Something important.

11:50.032 --> 11:54.735
You may leave now.

11:54.803 --> 11:57.772
Ah, thank you,
Emir, thank you.

12:27.634 --> 12:28.969
Just so we're clear.

12:29.036 --> 12:31.071
You don't like me
and I don't like you.

12:31.138 --> 12:32.472
That may be true.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.909
But I still can't understand
what it is you do here.

12:34.977 --> 12:37.312
Office of special projects.

12:37.379 --> 12:39.914
Compact ops,
no bureaucracy.

12:39.982 --> 12:41.983
It's like a small cap
investment fund.

12:42.051 --> 12:44.886
I only hear
the word "small."

12:44.954 --> 12:47.555
I wanna talk to you
about a proposal you wrote.

12:47.623 --> 12:49.323
Operation Ministry.

12:49.391 --> 12:50.658
Never heard of it.

12:50.726 --> 12:51.892
Three man team
pushes into Bolivia,

12:51.960 --> 12:54.094
taps into the main telecom line
for the M.A.S.

12:54.162 --> 12:56.230
You pitched it to Arthur,
he shot it down.

12:56.298 --> 12:59.433
I have no knowledge
of any such operation.

12:59.501 --> 13:03.136
I wanted to resurrect ministry
and I wanted you to run it.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.844
Now why would I get
in the middle of a turf war

13:10.912 --> 13:12.412
between you
and Arthur Campbell?

13:12.480 --> 13:15.281
How long have you been with
clandestine actions, Hadley?

13:15.349 --> 13:16.783
Two, three years?

13:16.850 --> 13:19.819
Still just a section chief?

13:19.887 --> 13:23.724
The hill is starved
for intel on Bolivia right now.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.994
An operation like ministry, wow.

13:27.062 --> 13:30.465
That'd be a big one
for everyone involved.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.268
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

13:39.176 --> 13:40.377
Hm.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.412
That's my favorite spot.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.281
- Right there.
- Really?

13:44.349 --> 13:46.083
That's the only good part?

13:46.150 --> 13:47.984
Ah, the other parts
are okay.

13:49.187 --> 13:50.353
This is the good one,
right here.

13:50.421 --> 13:51.721
Mm-hm.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.957
Mm.

13:57.627 --> 14:02.531
I got my itinerary
from the Peace Corps today.

14:02.599 --> 14:05.468
I leave for Eritrea on Sunday.

14:10.274 --> 14:13.410
I've waited
so long to do this.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.978
And now that
I'm finally ready to leave,

14:15.046 --> 14:19.016
I meet you.

14:19.084 --> 14:21.753
Two years
isn't that long.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.688
I mean, you'll write...

14:23.756 --> 14:25.056
call.
- Mm-hm.

14:25.124 --> 14:26.624
Visit.

14:26.692 --> 14:28.292
Even Skype.

14:28.360 --> 14:33.030
Well, you can Skype.

14:33.097 --> 14:36.966
- It's just--
- It's gonna be okay.

14:37.034 --> 14:40.703
We're gonna be okay.

14:40.771 --> 14:42.905
You gonna miss me?

14:42.973 --> 14:44.607
Mm...

14:44.675 --> 14:46.609
No.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.779
- Not at all.
- Mm.

14:52.549 --> 14:56.552
You remember Polykov.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.022
Oh, right.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.690
Right, Moscow.

15:00.758 --> 15:03.627
- The car bomb.
- That's him.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.429
I ran into him
a few weeks ago in Copenhagen.

15:06.497 --> 15:08.932
He sends his regards
by the way.

15:08.999 --> 15:10.700
Oh, wow.

15:10.768 --> 15:13.903
Well, I guess you guys
are back on speaking terms.

15:13.971 --> 15:15.538
What is he up to now?

15:15.606 --> 15:18.508
He owns a travel agency.

15:25.249 --> 15:26.516
Somebody's popped up
on our radar

15:26.584 --> 15:27.818
in the last couple of days
and I'm wondering

15:27.885 --> 15:30.788
if MI6 has anything on him.

15:30.855 --> 15:34.024
Could I get another?

15:34.092 --> 15:37.661
- Who's that?
- Karim Bichri.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.998
Doesn't ring a bell.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.332
Who is he?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.401
He's an art restorer
for the Smithsonian

15:43.468 --> 15:44.635
but we've been
hearing chatter

15:44.703 --> 15:45.769
that he's got some

15:45.837 --> 15:47.071
extracurricular
activities going on.

15:47.138 --> 15:48.605
Shall I look into it?

15:48.673 --> 15:50.207
Would you?
That'd be wonderful.

15:50.275 --> 15:54.145
I'm sure it's nothing.

15:54.213 --> 15:56.714
According to Bichri's schedule
he'll be lecturing all night.

15:56.782 --> 15:58.950
All I need is a few minutes
to look around.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.318
I could have got you
more than a few minutes

16:00.385 --> 16:01.986
during working hours.

16:02.054 --> 16:03.488
The type of looking around
I'm gonna do

16:03.555 --> 16:05.156
is generally frowned upon.

16:05.224 --> 16:06.858
You're snooping.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.461
I am MI6, love.

16:09.529 --> 16:10.629
Oh, wait.

16:10.696 --> 16:12.431
Cheeky.

16:12.498 --> 16:14.699
You sure you haven't
done this before?

16:14.767 --> 16:17.669
- It's beginner's luck.
- Hm.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.590
Did you learn that at MI6?

16:39.658 --> 16:42.426
Brixton.

16:42.493 --> 16:44.495
Let's just say I ran with
the wrong crowd in my youth.

16:44.562 --> 16:49.233
Remind me to get
a burglar alarm on my way home.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.535
Wouldn't make
any difference.

17:22.169 --> 17:23.670
What are you up to?

17:23.737 --> 17:26.105
What is it?

17:26.173 --> 17:27.272
It's called toluene.

17:27.340 --> 17:30.143
It's used in explosives.

17:30.211 --> 17:32.011
You think Bichri's
making a bomb?

17:53.402 --> 17:55.637
- It has to be something.
- We have to go.

17:55.705 --> 17:56.872
We have to get
out of here.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.207
Damn it.

18:23.265 --> 18:25.500
If we get caught
I lose my job.

18:25.567 --> 18:28.870
So you have to tell me
what's going on.

18:40.968 --> 18:43.770
Try the window.

18:43.838 --> 18:48.542
It's too late.

18:48.609 --> 18:50.844
Please don't tell my boss.

18:50.911 --> 18:52.612
I'm sorry, I was going
to speak with Mr. Bichri

18:52.680 --> 18:54.180
and I must have accidentally
tripped something.

18:54.248 --> 18:55.681
Are you alone in here?

18:55.749 --> 18:58.183
Yeah.

18:58.251 --> 18:59.785
This wing is off-limits
after hours.

18:59.853 --> 19:02.521
I didn't see any signs.

19:02.589 --> 19:03.722
Oh, my God!

19:03.790 --> 19:04.990
Sorry.
All right, all right.

19:05.057 --> 19:08.226
- Sorry!
- Okay, come on.

19:08.294 --> 19:12.264
Let's go.
- I'm sorry, I--

19:20.340 --> 19:21.707
Mr. Bichri,
I am so sorry.

19:21.775 --> 19:23.977
I just wanted to come
and talk to you about that tour.

19:24.045 --> 19:26.012
I was sure
I could change your mind.

19:26.080 --> 19:26.980
I must have accidentally
tripped the alarm

19:27.048 --> 19:28.682
as I was leaving.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.650
I don't believe you.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.652
Excuse me?

19:32.719 --> 19:37.423
I don't believe
anything you are saying.

19:37.490 --> 19:38.991
What were you
really doing in my studio?

19:39.058 --> 19:41.460
I just wanted
to talk to you.

19:41.527 --> 19:43.795
- Emir.
- Yes, Karim?

19:43.863 --> 19:45.196
Please check the studio.

19:45.264 --> 19:46.965
Make sure everything
is in order.

19:47.032 --> 19:49.400
Of course, Karim.

19:49.468 --> 19:52.336
I think it
goes without saying.

19:52.404 --> 19:56.908
I don't ever want to ever
see you in my studio again.

19:56.976 --> 19:59.643
Good night.

20:04.583 --> 20:05.750
The chemical
in Bichri's studio

20:05.817 --> 20:07.351
is toluene.

20:07.419 --> 20:08.986
It's a component
used in TNT,

20:09.054 --> 20:11.355
it is also
a common paint solvent.

20:11.422 --> 20:13.190
There's nothing suspicious
about him having it.

20:13.257 --> 20:14.624
And what about the sculpture?

20:14.692 --> 20:17.193
The shipment
and restoration process

20:17.261 --> 20:19.095
have been
painstakingly documented.

20:19.163 --> 20:21.097
It's completely
above board in every way.

20:21.164 --> 20:22.798
So we still haven't
turned anything up on Bichri,

20:22.866 --> 20:24.199
or the sculpture,

20:24.267 --> 20:27.336
and now Martin is putting
Annie's NOC at risk.

20:27.403 --> 20:28.704
Persia house
has flash traffic

20:28.771 --> 20:30.439
on a missing
terrorist financier.

20:30.507 --> 20:31.540
Annie, I want you on that.

20:31.608 --> 20:33.843
Joan, he was
way too collected.

20:33.911 --> 20:35.378
He is hiding something.

20:35.446 --> 20:36.913
Annie, we don't
have anything concrete.

20:36.981 --> 20:38.782
This is turning into
a wild goose chase.

20:38.849 --> 20:40.683
I don't know if it's
yours or Martin's hunch

20:40.751 --> 20:42.118
that you're following,

20:42.186 --> 20:47.458
but I'm terminating
the operation.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.796
- You're quitting?
- I'm sorry, Kenneth.

20:51.863 --> 20:54.865
I can't jeopardize
my job at the Smithsonian.

20:54.933 --> 20:56.099
I work at a museum.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.036
I don't share
your zest for danger.

20:59.104 --> 21:03.774
Bye.

21:03.842 --> 21:05.943
- What's that?
- The reason I'm doing this.

21:06.010 --> 21:08.845
About a year ago,
MI6 started hearing rumors

21:08.913 --> 21:10.648
about a high-profile fixer.

21:10.715 --> 21:13.250
A gun for hire who facilitated
for rogue nations

21:13.318 --> 21:14.852
and terrorist groups.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.154
- Facilitated what?
- Take your pick.

21:17.222 --> 21:19.490
Guns, information,
money-laundering.

21:19.558 --> 21:20.925
It was all rumors.

21:20.992 --> 21:23.060
No one could even suss out
if the bugger was real.

21:23.128 --> 21:24.528
You think it's Bichri?

21:24.596 --> 21:25.630
Bichri's been too close

21:25.697 --> 21:27.298
to too many
of these major events.

21:27.366 --> 21:30.301
It's all documented
in this journal.

21:30.369 --> 21:31.436
And there's another thing.

21:31.503 --> 21:33.137
What?

21:33.205 --> 21:36.341
Well, he seems
a little dodgy.

21:36.408 --> 21:37.575
Dodgy?

21:37.643 --> 21:40.446
A few weeks ago
MI6 intercepted chatter

21:40.513 --> 21:41.847
on the terror networks
about something called

21:41.915 --> 21:43.182
"the thinking man."

21:43.249 --> 21:45.284
The chatter talked about
an operation to smuggle

21:45.351 --> 21:48.387
"the thinking man"
out of Washington.

21:48.454 --> 21:49.855
Something's up with
that <i>Thinker</i> sculpture

21:49.922 --> 21:51.390
Bichri's restoring.

21:51.457 --> 21:53.225
We looked at it.
You couldn't find anything.

21:53.293 --> 21:54.326
Annie...

21:54.394 --> 21:56.228
You're like me.

21:56.296 --> 21:59.531
You know when
something doesn't feel right.

21:59.599 --> 22:03.235
What does your instinct
tell you about Bichri?

22:03.302 --> 22:06.038
I mean, I think
he's a bit dodgy,

22:06.105 --> 22:08.174
but that's
not a crime, right?

22:08.241 --> 22:12.545
Look, if you had
some concrete evidence...

22:12.612 --> 22:15.615
But I can't
just go on a hunch.

22:15.683 --> 22:17.517
<i>The Thinker</i> ships
back to Frankfurt tomorrow.

22:17.585 --> 22:20.253
I just need to get into
Bichri's studio one more time.

22:20.321 --> 22:21.621
- I'm sorry--
- Please.

22:21.689 --> 22:24.525
I can't.

22:35.638 --> 22:38.173
You sent
a team to Bolivia.

22:38.241 --> 22:40.208
I was expecting you sooner.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.943
I rejected that
operation for a reason, Jai.

22:42.011 --> 22:46.281
You rejected that operation
because you've gotten safe.

22:46.349 --> 22:48.617
Ambition has
clouded your judgment.

22:48.685 --> 22:49.985
My ambition is what
got me the latitude

22:50.052 --> 22:51.687
to make things happen
at this Agency.

22:51.754 --> 22:55.290
You made this happen.

22:55.358 --> 22:59.928
The Bolivians arrested Hadley
and his team last night.

22:59.996 --> 23:02.831
This is why rejected
Operation Ministry.

23:14.177 --> 23:16.912
Get me the state department
office in La Paz now.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.287
Well, I think
this sleeping bag

23:25.355 --> 23:26.855
will be warm enough.

23:26.923 --> 23:31.727
But if you need another one
I can pouch you--send you one.

23:31.795 --> 23:33.763
You do realize
I'm going to Eritrea, right?

23:33.831 --> 23:35.498
A desert country.

23:35.566 --> 23:37.033
Uh, yeah.

23:37.101 --> 23:38.769
And you're still gonna need
a sleeping bag because

23:38.836 --> 23:41.339
asmara is over
7,000 feet elevation

23:41.406 --> 23:44.175
and it can
hit freezing at night.

23:47.313 --> 23:49.547
Parker...

23:49.615 --> 23:51.349
What's going on?
What's the matter?

23:54.420 --> 23:56.420
Auggie...

23:59.158 --> 24:03.661
Ah, it's okay,
you don't have to say it.

24:03.729 --> 24:06.364
Eritrea is far, far away,

24:06.432 --> 24:10.702
and two years is a long time.

24:10.770 --> 24:13.472
Too long
to try and pretend, huh?

24:13.540 --> 24:17.076
- It'll fly by.
- Mm-hmm.

24:17.143 --> 24:19.778
And maybe I'll come back
and we'll both be single,

24:19.846 --> 24:21.981
and we can just...

24:22.048 --> 24:25.217
Pick things up.

24:25.285 --> 24:27.286
Stranger things, right?

24:27.354 --> 24:31.590
Yes.

24:31.658 --> 24:34.860
Look...

24:34.928 --> 24:38.798
The time
we've had together...

24:38.866 --> 24:42.636
has been great.

24:42.704 --> 24:48.209
And I haven't regretted
a single moment of it.

24:48.277 --> 24:50.244
I'm so sorry, Auggie.

24:50.311 --> 24:53.647
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

25:14.802 --> 25:17.204
Oba, oba.

25:36.492 --> 25:39.027
What are you doing here?

25:39.094 --> 25:40.428
Uh, sorry.

25:40.496 --> 25:41.629
Um...

25:41.697 --> 25:42.997
The shipment company
lost my delivery

25:43.065 --> 25:45.199
and I was just hoping
that that was it.

25:45.267 --> 25:48.169
It's my mistake.

25:48.236 --> 25:51.238
You shouldn't be here.

25:53.407 --> 25:54.274
Mm!

26:08.688 --> 26:12.291
I knew you
couldn't stay away.

26:24.176 --> 26:25.677
Unh!

26:30.416 --> 26:31.450
No tire arm.

26:31.518 --> 26:34.520
Unh...

26:34.588 --> 26:36.989
No car jack.

26:37.057 --> 26:38.057
They've gotten rid
of anything we could have

26:38.125 --> 26:40.794
used as a weapon.

26:40.861 --> 26:44.665
Here.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.333
Annie, I'm gonna
tell you something.

26:46.401 --> 26:47.901
Please don't panic.

26:47.969 --> 26:50.003
When you preface a statement
by saying "please don't panic,"

26:50.071 --> 26:51.472
you realize
it makes people panic.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.241
I'm not an MI6 field officer.

26:54.309 --> 26:55.810
I'm a surveillance operative.

26:55.878 --> 26:57.345
I don't understand.

26:57.412 --> 26:59.180
I'm what they call
a "neck-downer."

26:59.247 --> 27:00.447
I do the heavy lifting.

27:00.515 --> 27:01.682
Intimidation.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.451
The cutting
of the brake lines.

27:03.518 --> 27:05.486
The cash payments
to unsavory characters

27:05.553 --> 27:07.321
while the golden boys
stay clean.

27:07.388 --> 27:10.056
Why would MI6 send someone
like you on a field mission?

27:10.124 --> 27:14.193
Well, that's the other thing.

27:14.261 --> 27:16.428
This isn't
an official MI6 mission.

27:16.496 --> 27:18.997
Technically
I'm on holiday.

27:19.065 --> 27:20.265
By the way,

27:20.333 --> 27:22.300
the money I paid you,

27:22.367 --> 27:24.301
it came out
of my own pocket.

27:24.369 --> 27:25.469
Aargh!

27:25.537 --> 27:27.872
Damn it.

27:33.345 --> 27:36.413
I don't know
where they're taking us.

27:36.481 --> 27:37.848
But wherever it is
I'm gonna bet

27:37.916 --> 27:41.786
it's not good for us.

27:41.854 --> 27:45.423
Annie...

27:45.491 --> 27:50.829
Sorry I got you
involved in all this.

27:50.897 --> 27:53.431
Hold this.

27:53.499 --> 27:55.567
Okay.

27:55.635 --> 27:56.735
What are you doing?

27:56.802 --> 27:58.837
I'm looking
for the back seat

27:58.905 --> 28:00.071
release cable.

28:00.139 --> 28:01.506
It's usually
in the trunk lining.

28:01.574 --> 28:03.108
How do you know that?

28:03.176 --> 28:05.443
I took a YMCA
automotive repair course.

28:05.511 --> 28:06.711
You learn how
to escape a car trunk

28:06.779 --> 28:08.245
at the YMCA?

28:08.313 --> 28:10.080
It was
a really good course.

28:11.717 --> 28:12.783
I got it.

28:54.823 --> 28:56.958
Where'd you learn that,
the YMCA too?

29:00.929 --> 29:02.730
No, I already spoke
to the deputy director

29:02.798 --> 29:03.998
of both divisions.

29:04.066 --> 29:08.003
I need to speak
to the director...

29:08.070 --> 29:09.438
Fine.

29:09.505 --> 29:13.008
Tell him Jai Wilcox
needs to speak with him ASAP.

29:13.076 --> 29:15.110
Wilcox, yeah.

29:15.178 --> 29:17.112
Thank you.

29:22.085 --> 29:24.153
I have your father
on line one.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.188
Again.

29:26.256 --> 29:27.556
Tell him I'm busy.

29:27.624 --> 29:30.992
Again.

29:33.729 --> 29:34.963
Hey, Jai.

29:35.030 --> 29:36.097
Tim.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.665
I don't have
a lot of time.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.133
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.001
No, I just wanted to say
I heard about the Hadley thing.

29:41.069 --> 29:42.936
- Good job.
- What?

29:43.004 --> 29:45.038
It's all over the building.
Congrats.

29:45.106 --> 29:46.907
What do you mean, congrats?

29:46.975 --> 29:48.275
The rescue op.

29:48.343 --> 29:51.978
Good job.

29:54.983 --> 29:57.051
Where are we headed?

29:57.119 --> 29:58.653
I know someone
who can help.

29:58.721 --> 30:00.689
- Someone who?
- Need to know, Kenneth.

30:00.756 --> 30:02.190
Heh.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.892
I never realized
how irritating that is

30:03.960 --> 30:06.628
coming from
someone else's mouth.

30:06.696 --> 30:08.697
If this isn't
an MI6 sanctioned mission

30:08.764 --> 30:11.132
then why are you
doing all this?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.436
You know what field officers
call operatives like me?

30:14.504 --> 30:16.238
They call us the janitors.

30:16.305 --> 30:17.539
Because we do
all the dirty work

30:17.607 --> 30:18.940
that they're too good for.

30:19.008 --> 30:20.474
So why do it?

30:20.542 --> 30:22.777
Well, it's still
a chance to be part of MI6.

30:22.844 --> 30:24.611
Maybe I'm sweeping up
after elephants,

30:24.679 --> 30:29.549
but I'm still
in the circus.

30:29.617 --> 30:32.019
Where I'm from
no one gives you anything.

30:32.086 --> 30:34.054
You have to take it.

30:34.122 --> 30:36.424
I spent three years
taking night classes in Farsi

30:36.491 --> 30:38.692
and Arabic to get into MI6.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.695
But I still
wasn't good enough.

30:40.762 --> 30:42.696
To them I was still
just the duffer from Brixton

30:42.764 --> 30:44.465
they sent fishing
through rubbish containers

30:44.532 --> 30:46.567
playing the goon.

30:46.635 --> 30:48.702
I wanted to prove
I could be a field officer.

30:54.408 --> 30:58.144
Where are you going?

30:58.211 --> 31:01.247
I haven't been completely
honest with you either, Kenneth.

31:01.315 --> 31:04.650
Annie, what's going on?

31:04.718 --> 31:05.985
I'm sorry.

31:06.052 --> 31:08.955
The Smithsonian job
is just a cover.

31:09.023 --> 31:13.093
I'm actually
a field officer myself.

31:13.161 --> 31:15.896
- For the CIA.
- Bugger.

31:24.158 --> 31:26.360
I bet you
work out a lot.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.294
Based on what happened
to Annie and Martin,

31:28.362 --> 31:31.064
we sent a tech ops team
to Bichri's studio.

31:31.132 --> 31:33.566
They went over every inch
of that place, nothing.

31:33.634 --> 31:34.901
And what about the car
that Annie and Martin

31:34.969 --> 31:36.269
escaped in?

31:36.336 --> 31:37.971
Reported stolen
in Virginia three weeks ago.

31:38.038 --> 31:40.340
And at the time of Annie
and Martin's abduction,

31:40.407 --> 31:43.377
Bichri was giving a lecture
at the University of Delaware.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.145
So he has
an unbreakable alibi.

31:45.213 --> 31:46.246
Pretty much.

31:46.314 --> 31:47.614
In other words,
we have nothing

31:47.681 --> 31:49.349
that proves Bichri
is guilty of any wrongdoing.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.017
What about the guys
who tried to kill us?

31:51.085 --> 31:52.385
Even if we
don't have any proof,

31:52.453 --> 31:53.853
we know Bichri's
up to something.

31:53.921 --> 31:54.988
Annie, I'm gonna have to
hand this over to the FBI.

31:55.056 --> 31:56.356
But I know--

31:56.423 --> 31:58.024
We're spies, Annie.
Not cops.

31:58.092 --> 32:00.660
Your mission was to gather
information on an MI6 operative.

32:00.728 --> 32:03.564
Not solve a mystery.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.332
Well, you're enjoying
a regular busman's holiday

32:05.400 --> 32:06.967
aren't you?

32:07.035 --> 32:09.202
- Give me a moment to explain--
- Oh, believe me.

32:09.270 --> 32:11.438
You'll have plenty of chances
to explain when you get back

32:11.506 --> 32:12.906
to Vauxhall Cross.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.875
Am I making myself understood?

32:14.943 --> 32:16.443
And if you ever--

32:16.511 --> 32:18.245
Well, the British
are not pleased.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.713
Prepare yourself
for an inquisition.

32:19.781 --> 32:22.516
Looks like Martin's
intelligence career is over.

32:37.899 --> 32:39.466
It's okay, Annie.

32:39.534 --> 32:42.002
I followed my hunch
and it didn't work out.

32:42.070 --> 32:45.072
At least I tried.
It was a good hunch.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.141
You were right about me.

32:47.209 --> 32:48.743
I am a bit
of a romantic.

32:48.810 --> 32:52.980
It's why
I do what I do.

32:53.048 --> 32:57.951
You had me pegged
from the moment you saw me.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.721
It was nice
knowing you, Annie Walker.

33:00.788 --> 33:03.624
You were a fine asset.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.127
Come on, mate.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.163
I've had a long day,
and I'm cabbaged.

33:09.230 --> 33:12.065
Show me the way out.

33:25.612 --> 33:28.313
You wanted to see me?

33:28.381 --> 33:31.582
Yes, uh, your
"close and continuing"

33:31.650 --> 33:32.717
form came back.

33:32.785 --> 33:33.951
Well, that was fast.

33:34.019 --> 33:36.453
Sometimes bureaucracy
can surprise you.

33:36.521 --> 33:38.455
Anyway, it's been approved.

33:38.522 --> 33:41.091
You're free
to date Parker.

33:41.158 --> 33:45.495
Good to know.

33:45.563 --> 33:48.531
Whoever she is,
she must be a fool.

33:51.501 --> 33:54.737
No, she isn't.

33:54.805 --> 33:57.140
That's the problem.

33:58.208 --> 34:00.510
Mommy, we're missing it.

34:00.578 --> 34:03.147
Oh, cable's out and the girls
are missing their program.

34:03.214 --> 34:04.381
Oh.

34:05.584 --> 34:07.685
- That's much better.
- Aw.

34:07.753 --> 34:09.554
Call daddy,
he knows how to fix everything.

34:09.621 --> 34:10.856
Well, daddy's
not here right now,

34:10.922 --> 34:15.027
so you're just gonna
have to deal with me.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.263
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

34:18.331 --> 34:19.697
Hey.

34:19.764 --> 34:23.234
Why don't we go outside
and take a breather.

34:25.837 --> 34:28.338
So, ahem, Michael
is coming home next week.

34:28.406 --> 34:29.873
He cut is trip short.

34:29.940 --> 34:34.077
That's a good thing, right?

34:34.145 --> 34:37.848
Hey, you remember when
dad came back from deployment

34:37.915 --> 34:39.917
and wanted to surprise us
and you were six years old?

34:39.984 --> 34:40.984
Yeah, and he snuck
into the house

34:41.052 --> 34:42.253
without telling anybody.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.222
Yeah, and
you started screaming

34:44.289 --> 34:46.491
because you thought a burglar
had broken into the house.

34:46.559 --> 34:47.792
You'd completely
forgotten him.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.995
Danielle, Michael's
still the same guy.

34:50.063 --> 34:54.467
Nothing's changed.

34:54.534 --> 34:57.970
Aw, you know, I'm sorry
I called you over here.

34:58.038 --> 34:59.605
I'm just being silly,
you should go.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.207
No, no, no,
my evening's wide open.

35:01.274 --> 35:02.508
No, really.

35:02.575 --> 35:04.609
I just have to get
the girls ready for bed.

35:04.677 --> 35:07.746
Wha--?

35:07.813 --> 35:10.214
Danielle, did you get
another kid without telling me?

35:11.716 --> 35:14.018
- That's just Wally.
- Wally?

35:14.085 --> 35:16.720
Yeah,
Katia's imaginary friend.

35:21.125 --> 35:24.594
Danielle,
you're a life saver.

35:30.501 --> 35:34.938
I thought you'd be here.

35:35.006 --> 35:37.508
When my old man found out
I was trying for MI6

35:37.575 --> 35:41.278
he told me,
"Kenny boy, people like us

35:41.346 --> 35:43.114
don't do things like that."

35:43.181 --> 35:45.049
Well, he wasn't being cruel.

35:45.117 --> 35:49.821
It was just
the way saw things.

35:49.889 --> 35:52.825
Well, maybe he was right.

35:52.893 --> 35:54.326
Kenneth...

35:54.394 --> 35:56.162
The terrorist chatter
that you intercepted,

35:56.230 --> 35:57.296
what language was it in?

35:57.364 --> 35:58.364
It was Farsi.

35:58.432 --> 35:59.765
Why?

35:59.833 --> 36:02.134
You know what the Farsi word
for masterpiece is?

36:02.202 --> 36:03.970
- <i>Shahkar.</i>
- Right, but--

36:04.037 --> 36:06.439
But it's also a name.

36:06.507 --> 36:08.007
Annie, that's brilliant.

36:08.075 --> 36:10.777
Come on.
Where are we going?

36:10.845 --> 36:13.580
Well, who's gonna believe us
after everything I've pulled?

36:13.648 --> 36:16.884
We need proof.

36:48.049 --> 36:51.118
Okay, Mr. Lockpick,
you wanna help me with this?

36:52.855 --> 36:56.357
Or you could do that.

36:56.425 --> 37:01.362
What's an art restorer doing
with ultraviolet printer's ink?

37:01.430 --> 37:03.397
It's not a bomb
we're looking for.

37:03.465 --> 37:04.832
It's a person.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.500
Emir's the package
Bichri's smuggling

37:06.568 --> 37:07.501
out of Washington.

37:07.568 --> 37:09.102
I have to call Langley.

37:22.917 --> 37:25.018
- What's the plan, love?
- Call Langley.

37:25.086 --> 37:29.323
They can get a strike team
here in five minutes.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.563
Kenneth!

37:47.956 --> 37:49.423
Hey.

37:49.491 --> 37:52.627
Unh!

37:52.694 --> 37:54.361
Wanker.

38:33.737 --> 38:35.605
This way, stay close.

38:50.387 --> 38:51.921
Rrah!

39:00.630 --> 39:03.498
I know it was you.

39:03.566 --> 39:05.099
I know you were the one
who rescued Hadley

39:05.167 --> 39:06.667
and his team.

39:06.735 --> 39:09.804
Why'd you let me
take all the credit?

39:09.871 --> 39:12.305
Maybe I just wanted to bank
a little good will.

39:12.373 --> 39:14.107
I don't buy it.

39:14.175 --> 39:15.875
Okay, fine.

39:15.943 --> 39:17.577
Then you tell me.

39:17.644 --> 39:20.079
- Why did I do it?
- I don't know.

39:20.147 --> 39:22.114
But you must have
had some kind of angle.

39:22.182 --> 39:26.118
Maybe you want
something to hold over me?

39:26.185 --> 39:27.953
You're a manager now.

39:28.021 --> 39:31.423
This is real.
Real lives.

39:31.491 --> 39:34.259
It's not all about politics.

39:41.168 --> 39:44.504
Bichri was fronting for
the Abu Hafs al-Masri brigades.

39:44.572 --> 39:48.042
The guy he was trafficking's
real name is Shahkar Atwa.

39:48.109 --> 39:49.410
He's been on
the FBI's most wanted list

39:49.478 --> 39:50.945
for over a year now.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.914
My guess is things got too hot
for him here in the states

39:52.982 --> 39:54.883
and he hired Bichri
to smuggle him into England.

39:54.950 --> 39:57.886
- Thanks, Auggie.
- Nice work, Walker.

40:08.962 --> 40:10.963
So how bad is it?

40:11.031 --> 40:16.135
Absolute shambles.

40:16.203 --> 40:18.471
They made me
a field officer.

40:21.842 --> 40:24.577
I worked bloody hard
to get here.

40:24.645 --> 40:26.912
I gave up so much.

40:26.980 --> 40:29.982
Is it worth it?

40:30.050 --> 40:33.286
Yeah.

40:33.354 --> 40:35.388
You'll be a great
field officer, Kenneth.

40:35.456 --> 40:37.691
And if you ever need
another double Agent,

40:37.759 --> 40:39.126
call someone else.

40:40.595 --> 40:42.296
Hey.

40:42.363 --> 40:44.831
For the record...

40:44.899 --> 40:47.167
When I pinched your wallet,

40:47.235 --> 40:51.171
did you let me?

40:51.239 --> 40:53.974
Need to know, Kenneth.

40:53.999 --> 40:57.999
