WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.177
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.220 --> 00:04.961
RAVEN: MEET ELIGIUS IV.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.268
BELLAMY: "NO INMATES
PAST THIS POINT."

00:07.311 --> 00:08.486
MURPHY: THE PRISONERS
ARE STILL HERE.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.835
ECHO: THIS IS AN ARMY.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.446
CAN YOU RIG IT SO WE
CAN KILL THEM REMOTELY?

00:11.489 --> 00:13.100
-LEVERAGE.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.058
BELLAMY: PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS,
OR WE PULL THE PLUG.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.799
RAVEN: PULLING THE PLUG FROM
THE GROUND IS NOT AN OPTION.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.279
SOMEONE HAS TO STAY.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.281
I'M STAYING, TOO.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.370
HARRIS: COLONEL,
WE HAVE 5 MORE HOSTILES.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.198
WHAT DID I TELL YOU WOULD
HAPPEN IF YOU LIED TO ME?

00:24.241 --> 00:26.461
UGH! AAGH...

00:26.504 --> 00:30.465
BELLAMY? CLARKE
KNEW YOU WOULD COME.

00:30.508 --> 00:36.079
OCTAVIA: YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.385
CHOOSE.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.431
EACH OF YOU HAS COMMITTED CRIMES
AGAINST WONKRU.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.173
WIN THE FIGHT,
SAVE YOUR LIFE.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.914
BRING IN
THE NEXT COMBATANTS.

01:13.377 --> 01:17.207
EACH OF THESE 4 COMBATANTS HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST WONKRU.

01:17.251 --> 01:21.472
THEY ARE OUR ENEMIES--
TRAITORS TO OUR PEOPLE,

01:21.516 --> 01:26.390
TRAITORS TO OUR CODE
OF STRENGTH, UNITY, AND HONOR--

01:26.434 --> 01:28.827
BUT TODAY ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GIVEN A CHANCE

01:28.871 --> 01:31.787
TO ONCE AGAIN BE CALLED
BROTHER OR SISTER.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.746
HOWEVER, FIRST,
YOU MUST SURVIVE.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.010
THE ONLY RULE IN THIS ARENA IS,
BE THE LAST.

01:40.796 --> 01:45.844
AS ALWAYS, AS WE INVITE DEATH
INTO THIS HALL, WE HONOR IT.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.026
GAIA: OMON GON OSON.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.812
CROWD: OMON GON OSON.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.210
BE THE LAST.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.068
AAA--

02:46.253 --> 02:48.080
WHERE THE HELL
IS ABBY?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.301
ABBY: PLEASE!

02:51.345 --> 02:54.261
HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO DIE!

02:54.304 --> 02:58.874
TELL OCTAVIA.
TELL OCTAVIA IT WAS ME!

03:01.920 --> 03:03.748
IT WAS ME.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.325
-GAAH!
-YEAH!

03:17.284 --> 03:20.417
AH! AH!

03:20.461 --> 03:23.420
MAN: FINISH HIM!
FINISH THE JOB!

03:23.464 --> 03:27.250
WOMAN: FINISH HIM!

03:27.294 --> 03:29.774
YEAH!

03:41.308 --> 03:43.745
YAAH!

03:45.094 --> 03:47.096
YAAH!

03:48.750 --> 03:50.447
YAAH!

03:57.324 --> 03:59.587
HE'S LOSING THEM.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.639
MARCUS KANE,

04:08.683 --> 04:11.076
IN STEALING LIFE-GIVING MEDICINE
FROM WONKRU,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.644
YOU HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME
AGAINST OUR PEOPLE,

04:13.688 --> 04:17.431
BUT YOU ARE THE LAST.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.129
HAS HE EARNED HIS FREEDOM,
BLODREINA?

04:29.878 --> 04:32.620
NO.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.883
HE FIGHTS AGAIN
TOMORROW.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.594
SHAW, ON RADIO:
COLONEL, IT'S ME.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.117
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.423
SOMEHOW THEY BLOCKED
THE REMOTE ACCESS

05:36.466 --> 05:38.555
TO THE CRYO-ROOM
AND THE PODS.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.731
WE CAN'T WAKE ANYONE UP.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.907
DO I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION NOW?

05:42.951 --> 05:45.562
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU GOT ON MY SHIP,

05:45.606 --> 05:47.869
BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO ANY OF MY PEOPLE--

05:47.912 --> 05:49.740
NOTHING WILL
HAPPEN TO THEM

05:49.784 --> 05:52.526
AS LONG AS WE
CAN MAKE A DEAL.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.006
MCCREARY: I SAY
WE KILL HIM NOW.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.582
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:05.626 --> 06:07.584
WE NEED YOUR HELP
OPENING A BUNKER.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.151
YOU'RE MINERS,

06:09.194 --> 06:11.545
SO THAT SHOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

06:11.588 --> 06:15.636
IF YOU DO THAT,
I'LL LET YOUR PEOPLE GO.

06:15.679 --> 06:19.335
AND THEN WHAT,
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.424
THEN WE'LL SPLIT THIS
VALLEY DOWN THE MIDDLE.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.993
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
HAPPY IS ON YOU,

06:25.036 --> 06:28.649
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT
WE CAN FIND A WAY TO COEXIST.

06:32.653 --> 06:35.830
DIYOZA: THREATENING
TO KILL 283 OF MY PEOPLE

06:35.873 --> 06:38.659
IS ONE HELL OF A WAY
TO START A FRIENDSHIP.

06:38.702 --> 06:42.445
DO WE HAVE A DEAL,
OR NOT?

07:08.732 --> 07:10.821
OH...

07:10.865 --> 07:13.128
OH, YOU'RE
REALLY HERE.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.312
-SHE'S SAFE.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.183
SHE'S IN THE WOODS
WITH THE OTHERS.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.838
DIYOZA WON'T LOOK FOR THEM
AS LONG AS WE'RE IN CONTROL.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.973
YOU'RE ALL
STILL ALIVE--

07:32.016 --> 07:34.062
MURPHY,
MONTY, RAVEN?

07:34.105 --> 07:37.544
ECHO AND EMORI.
YEAH.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.503
CLARKE, YOU
SAVED US ALL.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.941
AND NOW YOU'RE HOME.

07:51.732 --> 07:55.692
WAIT. WHY'D SHE
RELEASE ME?

07:55.736 --> 07:59.000
WE MADE A DEAL.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.568
SHE AGREED TO OPEN
THE BUNKER.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.874
HUH.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.925
MURPHY: THEY'RE ALL
STILL ASLEEP.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.405
I TOLD YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.537
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.930
THE SLEEPING
PRISONERS ARE GREEN.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.758
AS MONTY WOULD SAY,
GREEN IS GOOD.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.282
THE EMPTY PODS WHERE
THE CREW SLEPT ARE RED.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.936
-RED IS--
-DEAD.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.112
YES. THAT INCLUDES
OUR FRIEND KODIAK.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.418
ANYWAYS,
IT'S HANDLED.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.420
THE ONLY ONE WAKING
THEM UP NOW IS ME.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.900
IF IT'S HANDLED,
WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE

08:29.944 --> 08:31.946
THAT RAVEN
WORK FACE ON?

08:31.989 --> 08:34.557
BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE
WANDERING AIMLESSLY,

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

08:35.950 --> 08:37.691
WHO WE'RE DEALING
WITH DOWN THERE.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.083
SHE LOOK FAMILIAR?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.737
IT'S THE WOMAN FROM
THE CAPTAIN'S LOG.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.913
COLONEL
CHARMAINE DIYOZA.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.089
SHE WAS SOMETHING THEY
CALLED A NAVY SEAL,

08:45.133 --> 08:46.917
WAS DECORATED FOR
VALOR 3 TIMES.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.353
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.790
HOW DOES A WAR HERO
END UP LEADING

08:49.833 --> 08:51.574
A MUTINY ON BOARD
A PRISON SHIP?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.010
GOOD QUESTION.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.795
SHE BECAME
A TERRORIST--

08:54.838 --> 08:56.666
BOMBING CAMPAIGNS,
ASSASSINATIONS.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.146
AT THE TIME
OF HER ARREST,

08:58.189 --> 09:00.365
SHE WAS THE MOST WANTED
CRIMINAL IN THE WORLD.

09:00.409 --> 09:03.020
OH, AND WE'RE THREATENING
TO KILL HER PEOPLE.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.674
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

09:04.718 --> 09:08.112
BELLAMY, ON RADIO:
RAVEN, CAN YOU HEAR ME? COME IN.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.684
TELL ME
EVERYONE'S OK.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.251
BELLAMY:
EVERYONE'S OK.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.209
WE REACHED A DEAL
WITH THE PEOPLE FROM THAT SHIP,

09:18.253 --> 09:20.864
AND, BY THE WAY,
THE LASER-COM'S AN OPEN LINE,

09:20.908 --> 09:22.649
SO THEY CAN HEAR
EVERY WORD WE SAY.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.911
NICE
TO MEET YOU.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.434
WE'RE NOT BAD
PEOPLE. WE--

09:25.477 --> 09:26.827
BELLAMY: RAVEN, KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM THE RADIO.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.437
COPY THAT.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.700
ANYWAY, THEY KNOW THE RULES,
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,

09:30.744 --> 09:32.572
COLONEL DIYOZA,
HERE THEY ARE AGAIN.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.748
IF ANYONE TRIES TO GET
AROUND YOUR SECURITY,

09:34.791 --> 09:36.053
YOU PULL THE PLUG.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.794
IF ANYONE DOES ANYTHING
THAT WASN'T AGREED UPON,

09:37.838 --> 09:39.361
YOU PULL THE PLUG,

09:39.404 --> 09:42.016
AND IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME
EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR,

09:42.059 --> 09:43.757
YOU PULL THE PLUG.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.323
IS THAT ALL?

09:45.367 --> 09:50.894
NO. THAT'S NOT ALL.
SOMEONE WANTS TO SAY HELLO.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.638
RAVEN, MURPHY,

09:55.682 --> 09:58.946
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICES.

09:58.989 --> 10:03.820
CLARKE? I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.693
JEEZ, AND THEY
CALL ME THE COCKROACH.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.564
HA!

10:08.608 --> 10:11.436
HEY, YOU GUYS JUST BE
CAREFUL UP THERE, OK?

10:11.480 --> 10:14.875
WE'LL TALK MORE ONCE
THIS IS ALL OVER.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.747
I WANT TO HEAR
EVERYTHING.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.054
OK, BUT FIRST,

10:20.097 --> 10:23.579
THANK YOU FOR
SAVING OUR LIVES.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.322
I MISS YOU BOTH.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.846
WE GOT TO GO.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.677
RAVEN, STAY SAFE.
WE'LL TALK SOON.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.636
YEAH, EVERY HOUR
ON THE HOUR.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.681
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BECAUSE IT SURE AS HELL

10:38.725 --> 10:41.858
FEELS LIKE WE'RE
NEGOTIATING WITH TERRORISTS.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.556
SHOE'S ON
THE OTHER FOOT?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.211
I WANT TO BE AIRBORNE
IN 90 SECONDS.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.867
T-MINUS 90 SECONDS
AND COUNTING.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.129
I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

10:52.173 --> 10:54.523
BUT THE GIRL SCOUT
IS NOT WRONG.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.091
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.006
I SAY WE TAKE THEM OUT
AND FLY BACK TO ELIGIUS

10:59.049 --> 11:00.877
AND GATHER OUR PEOPLE.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.792
HOW LONG WOULD IT
TAKE THIS RAVEN

11:02.836 --> 11:04.925
TO KILL EVERYONE
IN CRYO?

11:04.968 --> 11:06.883
ASSUMING SHE'S
REMOVED THE FAILSAFES,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.016
3 MINUTES.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.540
EVERYONE STRAP IN.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.679
DO YOU TRUST ME,
OR NOT?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.855
I DON'T TRUST
ANYONE.

11:21.898 --> 11:25.336
THERE'S A DOCTOR
IN THAT BUNKER--

11:25.380 --> 11:28.513
CLARKE'S MOTHER,
IT TURNS OUT.

11:28.557 --> 11:29.732
WE GRAB THE DOCTOR,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.778
KILL THE HOSTAGE TAKER
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.955
WE GO HOME
AND FIND A CURE.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.826
WILL YOU
TRUST ME NOW?

11:47.924 --> 11:50.013
READY FOR LIFTOFF.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.276
SHAW: 3, 2, 1.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.702
]

12:42.762 --> 12:46.374
YOU COULD HAVE WALKED AWAY
WITH YOUR FREEDOM YESTERDAY.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.420
YOU HAD THE CROWD
ON YOUR SIDE,

12:49.464 --> 12:52.772
BUT YOU LOST THEM WHEN
YOU SHOWED WEAKNESS.

12:55.905 --> 12:59.866
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T STEAL
THE MEDICINE, KANE.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.042
ADMIT IT.

13:02.085 --> 13:06.394
TELL ME WHO TOOK IT,
AND I'LL LET YOU GO.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.962
ONLY THE GUILTY SHOULD
FIGHT IN THE ARENA.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.354
WE'RE ALL GUILTY.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.487
I'M NOT HERE FOR A
PHILOSOPHY LESSON, KANE.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.358
I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU
A SECOND CHANCE.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.970
AND I'M OFFERING YOU
THE SAME.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.928
YOU KEPT US
TOGETHER, OCTAVIA.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.756
IT'S TRUE.
WONKRU'S STRONG.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.846
WE COULD HAVE TORN OURSELVES
APART DURING THE DARK YEAR.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.327
ONE MORE WORD
ABOUT THE DARK YEAR,

13:26.370 --> 13:27.937
AND I WILL PUT YOU
IN THE ARENA,

13:27.981 --> 13:30.592
EVEN IF YOU
TELL THE TRUTH.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.943
-YOU KNOW THE LAW.
-I WON'T FIGHT.

13:33.987 --> 13:37.294
HMM.
THEN YOU DIE.

13:38.948 --> 13:42.909
KANE:
YOU LOST YOUR WAY.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.302
WE ALL HAVE.

13:45.346 --> 13:49.350
I'VE BEEN QUIET
TOO LONG.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.614
YOU THINK THE ARENA
DELIVERS JUSTICE?

13:52.657 --> 13:54.050
I KNOW IT DOES.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.966
YOUR MOTHER--YOUR
MOTHER WAS FLOATED

13:57.010 --> 14:00.056
FOR HAVING A SECOND
CHILD, FOR HAVING YOU.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.191
I WAS PARTY TO THAT
AND SO MUCH MORE.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.803
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO
SOMETHING BETTER HERE.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.243
WE'RE
THROWING IT AWAY.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.984
OCTAVIA, PLEASE.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.944
STRENGTH WITHOUT
MERCY IS NOTHING.

14:17.987 --> 14:23.079
IT'S NOTHING,
BUT YOU CAN END IT.

14:23.123 --> 14:26.039
YOU CAN SAVE US.

14:26.082 --> 14:29.346
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

14:34.003 --> 14:37.702
TELL ME WHO STOLE
THE MEDICINE, KANE.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.147
SO BE IT.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.905
DON'T TRY TO TALK ME
OUT OF IT.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.994
I WON'T.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.145
HE WON YESTERDAY.

15:29.189 --> 15:32.018
I MADE SURE TO MATCH HIM UP
WITH A WEAKER OPPONENT TODAY,

15:32.061 --> 15:34.585
BUT HE'S REFUSING
TO FIGHT.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.197
MAYBE YOU CAN TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

15:39.112 --> 15:42.767
WAIT. IT WAS ME.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.988
ABBY: I TOOK THE DRUGS.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.470
I CAN'T FUNCTION
WITHOUT THEM, AND I--

15:49.513 --> 15:53.256
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM DIE
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT I DID.

15:54.823 --> 15:58.174
YOU WERE RIGHT
TO HAVE ME LOCK HER UP.

15:58.218 --> 16:01.351
HE KNEW YOU'D CONFESS
TO TRY TO SAVE HIM.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.093
THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YOU BOTH

16:04.137 --> 16:07.009
IS FOR HIM TO WIN.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.142
YOU HAVE
ONE MINUTE.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.233
TALK TO HIM.

16:18.064 --> 16:22.242
ABBY, WHAT
HAVE WE DONE?

16:24.157 --> 16:26.289
WHAT WE HAD TO DO
TO SURVIVE.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.248
HOW MANY TIMES CAN WE
TELL OURSELVES THAT?

16:28.291 --> 16:29.814
-IT'S THE TRUTH.
-NO.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.165
IT'S WHAT WE SAY TO
JUSTIFY THE HORROR

16:32.208 --> 16:35.342
WE INFLICT
ON EACH OTHER.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.822
I CAN'T DO IT
ANYMORE.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.737
BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.217
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
I'LL GIVE UP THE PILLS.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.914
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.220
SHH SHH SHH...

16:49.138 --> 16:51.662
I LOST MYSELF.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.756
-IT'S TIME.
-NO, NOT YET.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.244
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO.
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.681
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T CONFESS,

17:10.725 --> 17:14.511
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE,
BECAUSE IF YOU DIE,

17:14.555 --> 17:18.472
MY SACRIFICE
IS FOR NOTHING.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.910
-PROMISE ME.
-I PROMISE. I PROMISE.

17:21.953 --> 17:25.131
AND PROMISE ME YOU'LL
STOP TAKING THE PILLS.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.136
I WILL. I PROMISE.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.881
I LOVE YOU.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.232
KANE...

17:40.363 --> 17:42.670
OH...

18:12.308 --> 18:15.398
YO, LOOK
WHAT I FOUND.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.184
COME ON. WE CAN AT LEAST
HAVE A LITTLE FUN

18:18.227 --> 18:21.143
BEFORE OUR
POSSIBLE GENOCIDE.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.102
KIDDING, OBVIOUSLY.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.235
WHAT PSYCHOPATH ARE WE
STUDYING UP ON TODAY?

18:26.279 --> 18:29.804
NO ONE. THESE ARE THE FILES
FOR THE ELIGIUS MISSIONS.

18:29.847 --> 18:30.848
CHECK IT OUT.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.372
THE COMPANY FUNDED
3 OTHER LONG-HAUL

18:32.415 --> 18:33.460
INTERSTELLAR MISSIONS.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.896
WE'RE IN ELIGIUS IV.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.550
ELIGIUS I WAS AN EXPLORER
SHIP, UNMANNED.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.379
THEY FOUND HYTHYLODIUM
GOLD MINE ON THIS ASTEROID

18:39.422 --> 18:40.771
NAMED PROXIMA SIX.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.773
ELIGIUS II WAS THE FIRST
MISSION TO MINE IT,

18:42.817 --> 18:45.124
BUT IT FAILED BECAUSE IT
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MANPOWER,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.561
WHICH IS WHY THEY SWITCHED TO
PRISON LABOR FOR ELIGIUS IV.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.389
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO III?

18:49.432 --> 18:52.174
EXACTLY.
THAT'S THE WEIRD PART.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.481
I CAN ACCESS THE DATABASE
FOR I, II, AND IV,

18:54.524 --> 18:59.355
BUT III HAS AN AES
256-BIT ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.140
-ENGLISH.
-EVEN I CAN'T GET IN.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.271
GOT IT.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.620
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON IT FOR HOURS.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.535
WHOA, WHAT'S
HAPPENING?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.581
THEY'RE TRYING TO
HACK IN FROM THE GROUND.

19:07.624 --> 19:08.669
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:08.712 --> 19:10.192
STOPPING THEM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
WHAT I THINK IS, WE NEED
TO PULL THE DAMN PLUG.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.369
NO. I CAN DO THIS.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.718
RAVEN, IF YOU CAN'T
AND THEY GET IN...

19:14.762 --> 19:17.156
OK. JUST SHUT UP, MURPHY.
I'M ALMOST THERE.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.158
OH...GO.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.293
WE'RE GOOD.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.556
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.
WE NEED TO TELL BELLAMY.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.297
MURPHY, NO.
PLEASE DON'T.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.951
NO. YOU KNEW
THE RULES, OK?

19:29.994 --> 19:31.387
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
WE SIGNED UP FOR.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.345
WHAT IF THEY GET
THROUGH NEXT TIME?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.521
THEY WON'T.
I GOT THIS.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.305
DO YOU? LOOK, RAVEN.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.654
I CAN UNDERSTAND
NOT WANTING TO KILL

19:37.698 --> 19:39.134
300 PEOPLE
IN THEIR SLEEP,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.266
BUT IF WE CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THIS--

19:40.309 --> 19:42.311
I SAID, I CAN
DO THIS, OK,

19:42.355 --> 19:44.531
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO PLAY WITH YOUR BALL

19:44.574 --> 19:47.751
AND I'LL DO THE REST
LIKE ALWAYS?

19:51.277 --> 19:54.236
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

20:04.638 --> 20:08.119
GAIA: AS WE INVITE DEATH
INTO THIS HALL, WE HONOR IT.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.124
GAIA: OMON GON OSON.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.388
CROWD: OMON GON OSON.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.913
GAIA: AND, AS ALWAYS,
BE THE LAST.

20:26.660 --> 20:31.404
WHAT IS THIS?
CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.197
FIGHT ME, DAMN YOU,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.939
OR NEITHER OF US WILL
GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.725
UGH!

20:53.774 --> 20:56.820
I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU.

20:56.864 --> 21:00.346
I WILL NOT
KILL THIS MAN.

21:02.173 --> 21:07.831
KANE: SOMEHOW WE ALLOWED JUSTICE
TO BECOME VENGEANCE

21:07.875 --> 21:10.834
AND VENGEANCE
TO BECOME SPORT,

21:10.878 --> 21:15.274
AND I ALLOWED THAT,
THAT DARKNESS TO RISE...

21:16.579 --> 21:19.365
BUT MY COMPLICITY
ENDS TODAY.

21:19.408 --> 21:24.413
YOU ARE WONKRU, OR YOU
ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.503
CHOOSE.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.245
I ALREADY HAVE.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.992
UH!

21:39.341 --> 21:41.300
GET UP.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.780
COME ON, KANE.

21:43.824 --> 21:47.131
WHERE IS YOUR
SURVIVAL INSTINCT?

21:48.611 --> 21:51.658
SAVING MY PEOPLE
IS ABOUT MORE

21:51.701 --> 21:54.356
THAN KEEPING
THEM ALIVE.

21:57.577 --> 22:01.058
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.499
FOR YOU, IT IS.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.382
INDRA: CLEAR THE ARENA!

22:20.426 --> 22:22.384
GET THE PRISONERS
TO THEIR CELLS.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.604
OCTAVIA,
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.997
NO. NO!

22:52.545 --> 22:54.242
OH...

22:58.159 --> 23:02.337
I KNEW YOU'D COME.
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.507
WHO ARE THEY?

23:41.550 --> 23:45.162
WE'RE HERE
TO RESCUE YOU.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.557
-O., O., IT'S OK.

23:48.601 --> 23:52.343
WE HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING.

23:52.387 --> 23:56.652
CLARKE: BEFORE WE GET TO THAT,
WHERE'S MY MOM?

23:56.696 --> 23:59.612
I'LL TAKE HER
TO HER MOTHER.

24:03.354 --> 24:06.880
DIYOZA: SO I TAKE IT
YOU'RE HIS SISTER.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.534
BELLAMY: YES. SORRY.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.753
OCTAVIA, THIS IS
COLONEL DIYOZA.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.495
-USED TO BE.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.325
LOVE THE WAR PAINT,
BY THE WAY.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.331
OK, SO HOW
DO WE DO THIS?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.767
TWO AT A TIME.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.596
WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE
GET YOUR THINGS,

24:27.640 --> 24:30.643
AND WE'LL GET STARTED
AS SOON AS WE'RE READY TOPSIDE?

24:46.702 --> 24:48.748
EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE

24:48.791 --> 24:50.880
SHOULD WE BE PREPPING
FOR EXTRACTION?

24:50.924 --> 24:54.144
-1,200.
-814.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.064
COPY THAT.

25:03.893 --> 25:07.244
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WE'RE SAVING TODAY IS 814.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.682
YOU GOT THAT, SHAW?
HOW'S IT COMING UP THERE?

25:09.725 --> 25:11.248
I'M STILL LOCKED OUT.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.468
WHOEVER THIS GIRL IS,
SHE'S GOOD.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.558
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN I GET BACK IN.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.655
REAL CUTE.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.590
MURPHY?

25:48.634 --> 25:51.114
YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS
A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE A NAP?

25:52.551 --> 25:53.726
YEAH. WHY NOT?

25:53.769 --> 25:56.250
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN
DOING IT FOR 100 YEARS.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.296
WHAT, YOU THOUGHT ONE
OF THEM WAS WAKING UP?

25:59.340 --> 26:00.689
YOU SAID THAT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.909
IT'S NOT.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.912
WHAT, EXACTLY, ARE YOU
DOING HERE, RAVEN,

26:05.955 --> 26:08.654
COMING TO HANG OUT
WITH ALL THE PEOPLE

26:08.697 --> 26:11.047
YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO KILL?

26:14.703 --> 26:16.749
WAIT.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.664
RAVEN, WAIT.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.971
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

26:22.015 --> 26:24.583
I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS IS.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.152
LOOK. I'M SORRY IF I
WAS A BITCH BEFORE.

26:29.196 --> 26:33.766
I JUST--
I'M JUST AFRAID

26:33.809 --> 26:36.812
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO PULL THE PLUG.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.902
I KNOW.

26:39.946 --> 26:43.645
THAT'S WHY
I'M GONNA DO IT.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.691
-MURPHY--
-JUST WAIT.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.736
EVERYBODY WAS SO SURPRISED
WHEN I STAYED BEHIND,

26:47.780 --> 26:49.695
I MEAN, MOST OF ALL ME.

26:49.738 --> 26:52.306
THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS
DOING IT TO IMPRESS EMORI,

26:52.349 --> 26:54.961
BUT THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT IT...

26:57.920 --> 27:01.228
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE THE ONE TO SACRIFICE?

27:03.796 --> 27:06.625
ANYWAY, IF IT
COMES DOWN TO IT,

27:06.668 --> 27:08.844
I GOT THIS.

27:26.906 --> 27:31.040
-HE'S ALIVE...FOR NOW.

27:35.479 --> 27:38.091
HI, MOM.

27:40.310 --> 27:43.139
CLARKE?

27:52.714 --> 27:57.023
HOW

27:57.066 --> 27:58.589
WHEN? WHEN DID--

27:58.633 --> 28:00.809
WE SHOULD MOVE, NOW.

28:06.902 --> 28:10.036
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK,

28:10.079 --> 28:13.343
BUT FIRST, WE HAVE
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.215
COME ON.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.786
WHAT HAPPENS
TO MARCUS?

28:20.829 --> 28:22.265
I'LL GET HIM
TO THE GROUND.

28:22.309 --> 28:25.355
AFTER THAT,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.807
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:41.850 --> 28:45.158
CROWD: KOM FALAU
OSO NA GYON OP.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.160
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.771
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.251
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.993
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.256
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.824
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.043
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.394
KOM FALAU OSO
NA GYON OP.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.790
UH UH!

29:40.779 --> 29:41.823
COME ON.

29:41.867 --> 29:42.824
UH!

29:46.741 --> 29:48.090
THANK YOU.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.050
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.886
THE DEAL
WAS NO WEAPONS.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.931
NOT MY DEAL.

30:02.975 --> 30:06.674
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU IN PRIVATE.

30:06.717 --> 30:09.459
GIVE ME A SECOND,
THEN FOLLOW ME.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.737
OK. BRING HIM UP.

30:36.312 --> 30:40.229
BLODREINA,
THE RED QUEEN.

30:40.273 --> 30:44.103
TELL ME ABOUT
THE FIGHTING PIT.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.453
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

30:46.496 --> 30:48.107
BECAUSE IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE SOMEONE

30:48.150 --> 30:49.804
READ OVID A FEW
TOO MANY--

30:49.848 --> 30:52.502
6 YEARS
IS A LONG TIME.

30:52.546 --> 30:56.245
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
I'VE CHANGED.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.730
WE HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT, O.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.951
WE DO,

31:05.994 --> 31:07.648
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.998
I DON'T TRUST
THESE PEOPLE, BELL.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.087
WHO ARE THEY?
WHERE'D THEY COME FROM?

31:12.131 --> 31:13.349
WHY ARE THEY
HELPING US?

31:13.393 --> 31:16.004
I DON'T TRUST THEM,
EITHER, OK,

31:16.048 --> 31:18.311
BUT I NEED YOU
TO TRUST ME.

31:18.354 --> 31:20.226
WE HAVE LEVERAGE.

31:20.269 --> 31:23.446
WHAT KIND
OF LEVERAGE?

31:29.235 --> 31:31.846
ALL RIGHT.
BRING HIM IN.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.766
CLEAR.

31:41.638 --> 31:44.163
HI. HEY...

31:51.300 --> 31:52.867
WAIT FOR NIGHT.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.001
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.758
THERE'S OUR DOCTOR.

32:16.282 --> 32:19.198
DIYOZA: SHAW, WHAT THE HELL
IS TAKING SO LONG?

32:19.241 --> 32:21.374
I TOLD YOU, THIS GIRL
IS SOME KIND OF GENIUS.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.245
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT OF,
SHE THOUGHT OF FIRST.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.204
SHE EVEN HAD TIME
TO FLIP ME THE BIRD.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.292
DOES THAT MEAN
SHE KNOWS YOU'VE

32:26.335 --> 32:27.858
BEEN TRYING
TO GET BACK IN?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.599
-MAYBE, BUT--
-I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

32:29.643 --> 32:30.992
THOSE ARE OUR MEN
UP THERE, SHAW.

32:31.036 --> 32:34.126
RELAX.
THEY'RE OK. SEE?

32:34.169 --> 32:36.432
SNUG AS CRIMINALLY
INSANE BUGS

32:36.476 --> 32:39.740
IN HERMETICALLY
SEALED RUGS.

32:42.221 --> 32:45.615
HERMETICALLY SEALED.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.487
WHAT?

32:47.530 --> 32:50.098
WE STILL GOT ACCESS
TO THE DOCKING BAY DOORS?

32:50.142 --> 32:52.100
UH...

32:55.190 --> 32:57.018
YEAH.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.151
OPEN THEM ALL.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.544
-THAT'D KILL THEM.
-NOT OUR PEOPLE.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.982
WE FOUND OUR DOCTOR.
IT'S TIME TO END THIS.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.900
OPENING
DOCKING BAY DOORS.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.384
JOHN MURPHY TAKES THE PASS--
FROM HIMSELF, MIND YOU--

33:15.428 --> 33:16.820
DRIBBLING
DOWN THE PITCH.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.692
MEANWHILE, GO-SCI'S
MONSTROUSLY HIDEOUS,

33:18.735 --> 33:20.302
ONE-LEGGED GOALIE
ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND.

33:20.346 --> 33:23.436
CAN SHE? NO. SHE CAN'T.
HE'S GOT TOO MUCH SPEED.

33:23.479 --> 33:26.439
CAN HE DO IT?
GOAL! YES!

33:26.482 --> 33:29.094
YES! OH, IT'S SO SWEET.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.749
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

33:32.793 --> 33:34.534
VOICE: EAST DOCKING BAY
DOOR OPENING.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.144
THEY'RE TRYING
TO KILL US

33:36.188 --> 33:37.406
BY VENTING
THE OXYGEN.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.714
-THAT'S NOT GOOD.
-IT'S TIME TO PULL THE PLUG.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.847
-NOT LONG.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.241
WAIT. LONG ENOUGH
TO PUT US INTO CRYO?

33:46.285 --> 33:47.329
GOOD IDEA.
TELL ME HOW.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.244
YOU'RE YOU, ALL RIGHT?
FIGURE IT OUT.

33:49.288 --> 33:53.422
MURPHY, IT'S TIME.
PULL THE LEVER.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.599
FINE. I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.166
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.124
WHAT?

33:59.167 --> 34:02.562
I'M NOT READY TO DIE.
ARE YOU?

34:02.605 --> 34:05.043
-IT'S DONE.
-GOOD JOB.

34:05.086 --> 34:08.002
GET HER
READY TO FLY.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.484
WAIT.

34:11.527 --> 34:14.313
WHAT IS IT, SHAW?
TALK TO ME.

34:14.356 --> 34:15.923
THEY'RE WAKING UP.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.317
THEY OPENED
THE PODS.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.014
COLONEL, IF WE DON'T
CLOSE THE OUTER BAY DOORS

34:20.058 --> 34:21.929
RIGHT NOW, YOUR PEOPLE
ARE GONNA DIE, TOO.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.105
YOU MEAN OUR PEOPLE,
DON'T YOU, LIEUTENANT?

34:24.149 --> 34:26.499
WHAT ARE
YOUR ORDERS?

34:29.502 --> 34:31.156
CLOSE THE DOORS.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.333
EITHER WAY, WE'RE
BACK IN CONTROL.

34:34.376 --> 34:38.554
YOUR FRIEND MAY BE SMART,
BUT SHE'S A COWARD.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.952
LIVE COWARD.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.708
SURVIVAL
INSTINCT SUCKS.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.687
THIS IS A MISTAKE,
BROTHER.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.515
SHE'S STARTING
WITH HER FIGHTERS.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.343
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.519
THAT'S AN ARMY
RIGHT THERE.

35:30.563 --> 35:33.305
MORE OF US ARE LOYAL
TO YOU THAN TO HER.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.829
JUST SAY THE WORD.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.787
NOT YET.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.272
THE TIME WILL COME.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.448
JUST DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.494
DIYOZA: LET'S GO.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.889
WHERE'S MY DOCTOR?

36:04.684 --> 36:07.426
OK. WE'RE SAFE HERE.
LET'S GET THOSE CUFFS OFF.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.211
IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND THAT VALLEY'S

36:10.255 --> 36:13.693
THE ONLY SURVIVABLE PLACE,
WHERE WILL YOUR MOTHER AND I GO?

36:13.736 --> 36:16.304
I'LL TALK TO OCTAVIA,
SEE IF I CAN REASON WITH HER.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.958
YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.613
REGARDLESS,
THAT'S TOMORROW'S PROBLEM.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.267
TODAY WE HAVE TO KEEP YOU
OUT OF SIGHT

36:22.310 --> 36:23.790
UNTIL EVERYONE
IS SAFELY--

36:25.879 --> 36:27.359
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

36:27.402 --> 36:29.883
I KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.
STAY HERE.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.409
DIYOZA: SORRY ABOUT
YOUR PRETTY FOUNTAIN,

36:34.453 --> 36:37.282
BUT THAT WAS
ONLY HALF POWER.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.371
I KNOW MOST OF YOU
ARE ARMED.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.982
IF ANYONE MOVES
FOR A WEAPON,

36:42.025 --> 36:45.464
YOU'LL SEE WHAT FULL POWER
DOES TO HUMAN FLESH.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.292
-IT'S NOT PRETTY.
-HEY!

36:47.335 --> 36:49.555
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:49.598 --> 36:52.862
-ONE CALL FROM ME--
-MAKE YOUR CALL.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.609
RAVEN, COME IN.
READ ME?

37:07.616 --> 37:10.793
THE DEAL'S OFF, BUT
NOBODY HAS TO GET HURT.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.969
MAN: SOMEONE'S COMING.

37:13.013 --> 37:16.277
DIYOZA: HOLD YOUR FIRE.
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

37:18.453 --> 37:21.761
SHE'S OUR DOCTOR.
YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.111
MCCREARY: SHE ASKED
YOU A QUESTION.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.331
WHERE IS THE DOCTOR?

37:26.374 --> 37:27.767
SZYBUNKA: THAT'S RIGHT.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.421
YOU'RE NOT SO TOUGH NOW,
ARE YOU?

37:29.464 --> 37:32.815
OCTAVIA: NO! HOLD.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.301
ABBY: I'M RIGHT HERE.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.395
ABBY: DON'T SHOOT.

37:47.439 --> 37:50.355
WE'LL COME
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

37:50.398 --> 37:54.446
I BET YOU WILL, TRAITOR.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.448
-THE TWO OF US.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.755
THOSE ARE MY TERMS.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.543
I SEE WHERE YOUR
DAUGHTER GETS IT FROM.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.458
TAKE THEM BOTH.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.851
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:08.895 --> 38:13.465
-LET'S GO. MOVE.
-OK, THEN. HERE ARE MY TERMS.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.336
THE VALLEY IS OURS.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.819
ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THERE WILL BE
MET BY OVERWHELMING FORCE.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.561
AS LONG AS YOU STAY HERE,

38:22.604 --> 38:24.954
WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.829
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

38:31.613 --> 38:34.399
WHAT ABOUT RAVEN
AND MURPHY?

38:34.442 --> 38:36.401
FOR NOW, INSURANCE.

38:36.444 --> 38:39.969
LET'S GO. ON ME.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.803
DIYOZA: SZYBUNKA,
THAT'S AN ORDER.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.461
YAAH!

38:55.855 --> 38:58.292
DIYOZA:
SZYBUNKA, YOU IDIOT!

38:58.336 --> 39:00.729
GET TO THE SHIP. MOVE! NOW!

39:00.773 --> 39:03.036
PREP FOR EMERGENCY EVAC.

39:10.478 --> 39:11.827
UH!

39:11.871 --> 39:14.047
OCTAVIA,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

39:14.090 --> 39:16.223
I'VE GOT YOU.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.362
VOICE: AUTO PILOT ENGAGED.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.711
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

39:25.754 --> 39:27.626
WHAT HAPPENED IS,
WE'RE AT WAR.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.410
GO MISSILES HOT--
ONE INTO THE CROWD,

39:29.454 --> 39:30.455
ONE INTO THE BUNKER.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.543
WAIT. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:31.586 --> 39:32.631
-GET THEM OUT OF HERE.
-NO. WAIT.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.675
-DO IT NOW.
-HOLD ON.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.068
-PLEASE!
-MY DAUGHTER IS DOWN THERE.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.852
WHOA. SLOW DOWN.
THIS IS A MINING SHIP.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.593
THOSE MISSILES
ARE DESIGNED

39:38.637 --> 39:40.116
TO BREAK UP ASTEROIDS,
NOT CROWDS.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.250
BECAUSE OF THIS IDIOT,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

39:43.293 --> 39:46.471
THEY WILL RETALIATE.
WE HAVE TO END THIS NOW.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.820
COLONEL, JUST THINK.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.431
BY MY COUNT, THERE ARE LESS
THAN 1,500 PEOPLE LEFT

39:50.475 --> 39:51.780
IN THE HUMAN RACE.

39:51.824 --> 39:56.350
-SHE GAVE YOU AN ORDER.
-I'M FLYING THIS SHIP.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.439
SHOOT ME, WE ALL DIE.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.268
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU
AGAIN, LIEUTENANT.

40:04.837 --> 40:07.056
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.895
MCCREARY: WHAT'S
TAKING SO LONG?

40:21.244 --> 40:24.073
-I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JAMMED.

40:24.117 --> 40:27.860
-HAS TO BE.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.779
LET'S GO GET HER.

40:33.822 --> 40:36.782
COPY THAT.
EVERYBODY STRAP IN.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.524
MAIN ROCKET BURN
IN 3, 2--

40:52.711 --> 40:56.192
ONLY HAVE 283 MORE.

41:10.946 --> 41:14.907
I TRUSTED YOU.
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.388
MILLER: BLODREINA...

41:18.432 --> 41:21.261
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

41:21.304 --> 41:24.569
NOW WE GO TO WAR.
