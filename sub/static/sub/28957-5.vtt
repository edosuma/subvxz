WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:05.939
I want to start
my fucking private club!

00:05.973 --> 00:07.741
And I want you to be my partner.

00:07.775 --> 00:12.313
The goal is to only deal with
a few high-level customers.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.948
They buy the coke,
they cook the rock theyselves.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.450
All we gotta do is deliver
and collect.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.818
CISSY:
We lost the property.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.820
It's not one we wanted to lose.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.855
ANDRE:
Captain, this is something new.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.757
It's called "rock."

00:23.791 --> 00:25.259
And it's expanding
beyond my neighborhood,

00:25.293 --> 00:26.694
and moving up towards
the Coliseum.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.961
What are you suggesting?

00:27.995 --> 00:30.998
You and me, we at war.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.334
-Your men ready to roll,
Sergeant?
-Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.035
Let's go.
Hook 'em and book 'em!

00:35.069 --> 00:39.840
(overlapping shouting)

00:39.873 --> 00:41.008
-(gun cocks)
-Do not move!

00:41.041 --> 00:43.144
-Get your hands off...
-(screaming)

00:43.177 --> 00:45.279
(overlapping shouting)

00:45.313 --> 00:46.714
LOUIE:
Fuck you!

00:46.747 --> 00:49.049
You need to be thinking about
how you're gonna handle Andre.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.884
ALTON:
I know how this feels.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.953
How bad you must want
to get back.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.522
But you can't kill no cop.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.825
I'm talking about the hell

00:57.858 --> 01:01.162
that will be rained down
upon black folks

01:01.195 --> 01:04.498
if that happens.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.535
-Franklin, please, just listen.
-Get the fuck out of here

01:07.568 --> 01:09.670
before I call her back.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.411
REPORTER (over TV):
...mindset and why detectives

01:17.445 --> 01:20.248
across several states were
unable to share information

01:20.281 --> 01:21.449
that might have
prevented further...

01:21.482 --> 01:24.218
So, where did you find this kid?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.586
TEDDY:
Through Avi.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.588
Right, the arms dealer.

01:27.621 --> 01:31.425
Yeah. But before that,
he was buying product off me.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.760
REPORTER 2 (over TV):
LAPD Chief...

01:32.793 --> 01:36.264
Hey, look, I know you have
a job to do here.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.867
I get that. But...

01:39.900 --> 01:41.169
you have to protect my assets.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.371
You can't share their names
with the D.O.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.739
And you think if you keep
saying it over and over,

01:45.773 --> 01:48.809
it will increase my chances
of listening to you?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.245
Because they won't.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.713
What the hell?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.382
SPOKESPERSON (over TV):
...executed four simultaneous

01:54.415 --> 01:56.717
drug raids on various locations

01:56.750 --> 01:58.219
in the South Central region.

01:58.252 --> 02:02.323
These raids resulted in 14
arrests, as well as the seizure

02:02.356 --> 02:06.294
of over 20 kilograms of
cocaine, rock cocaine,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.629
and a variety of
high-caliber weapons,

02:08.662 --> 02:09.897
including a submachine gun.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.599
Jesus.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.434
At this time, I'd like to
turn it over to the officer

02:13.467 --> 02:15.703
who led the raids,
our own Sergeant Andre Wright.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.640
Andre Wright?

02:19.673 --> 02:23.877
Isn't that the arresting officer
on Saint's murder charge?

02:23.911 --> 02:26.180
ANDRE:
...37th Street Division.

02:26.214 --> 02:30.484
These seizures are a huge
victory in our ongoing fight

02:30.518 --> 02:32.486
against dangerous weapons
and drugs.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.655
And we all need to stay
vigilant, united...

02:34.688 --> 02:36.457
-This a problem?
-...and alert

02:36.490 --> 02:38.959
in our fight against crime.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.628
NEWSWOMAN (over TV):
When we return...

02:40.661 --> 02:43.397
*

02:54.375 --> 02:58.111
* They call me Big Bad John *

02:58.145 --> 03:01.849
Seriously, man,
this is your victory.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.817
You own this.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.520
All right?
So let's give it up, men.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.857
-To Sergeant Wright!
-(all cheer)

03:09.890 --> 03:11.892
Mm!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.663
Hey. Two shots of Cuervo,
my man.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.865
Oh, no, no, I'm good.
Thank you.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.534
Oh, the hell you are.
You are taking a shot, Sergeant.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.236
That is an order.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.404
I outrank you.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.306
(laughs)
Not in these parts you don't.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.808
Let's go!

03:27.841 --> 03:29.209
* They call me Big Bad John... *

03:29.243 --> 03:31.245
-Uh-- Hey!
-Oh.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.413
-Oh, shit.
-(sighs)

03:32.446 --> 03:34.114
I'm sorry, honey. Here.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.683
-I got you-- Whoa!
-Excuse me!

03:35.716 --> 03:38.852
Easy, princess.
I said I was sorry.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.254
Yeah, you're a real gentleman.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.389
ANDRE:
Why don't you go outside, man?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.156
-Have a smoke.
-What the hell is your problem?

03:43.190 --> 03:44.992
-Get some fresh air.
-All right, all right,
all right, all right.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.227
Hey, I'm so sorry.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.196
Your friend always act
like that?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.132
Uh, he had a few too many,
but, uh,

03:52.165 --> 03:53.634
we're here celebrating.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.002
Yeah, I noticed.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.771
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.540
(sighs)
What are you celebrating?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.542
You win a softball game
or something?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.111
(chuckles)

04:04.144 --> 04:07.448
Yeah. Something like that.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.383
I'm Sheila.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.419
-Andre.
-Mm.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.389
You gonna buy me another drink
or what?

04:15.423 --> 04:16.424
-You're lying!
-(laughing)

04:16.457 --> 04:19.259
You're lying.
11 brothers and sisters?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.861
Mm. Yep.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.530
Seven girls, four boys.
(chuckles)

04:22.563 --> 04:24.532
Good lord. Oh, man.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.067
I mean, I'm raising one,
and I can barely handle it.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.202
Hey, it made me strong.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.371
I learned how to fend
for myself.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.740
Hey, be gentle with this one.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.907
He's a delicate little flower.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.744
-Get out of here, man!
-Okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.078
Let's go, boys!

04:40.113 --> 04:42.149
Sorry about that.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.151
You apologize
for your friend a lot.

04:44.184 --> 04:48.088
He's more of a coworker.
Barely even like the guy.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.158
-Hey, well,
that makes two of us.
-(chuckles)

05:03.504 --> 05:06.907
Where did you come from?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.109
I sure wish I could
take you home.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.511
Mm.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.418
What?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.300
Damn.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.536
Look at this place.

05:36.970 --> 05:37.971
You crooked or something?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.773
(scoffs)
What?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.109
-How's a cop afford this?
-Oh, well,

05:42.142 --> 05:44.011
this is a-a splurge, believe me.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.447
But it turns out,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.149
these'll get you
a nice discount.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.166
(Sheila moans softly)

06:10.538 --> 06:11.839
Why don't you get comfortable.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.841
I'll make us a nightcap.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.220
(knock on door)

06:27.254 --> 06:29.923
WOMAN:
Housekeeping.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.593
Housekeeping.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.628
(groans softly)

06:36.063 --> 06:37.465
(door opens)

06:37.498 --> 06:39.967
(door closes)

06:40.000 --> 06:41.869
Oh, sorry.
I'll-I'll come back.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.337
What?

06:44.371 --> 06:48.008
(door opens, closes)

06:48.041 --> 06:49.242
(exhales)

06:54.882 --> 06:56.784
(sighs heavily)

07:09.429 --> 07:11.164
*

07:30.784 --> 07:33.587
Mm. Give my love to Estelle.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.855
SHEILA:
I will.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.724
-Call me when you land.
-All right.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.959
-Be good, baby girl.
-I will.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.428
Thank you.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.369
You be good to her.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.697
*

08:48.061 --> 08:49.663
(engine turns off)

08:56.637 --> 08:57.838
'Sup, Reed?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.306
What's going on?

08:59.339 --> 09:03.811
What's going on is your business
all over the 5:00 news.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.079
We met up right after that shit
went down last week.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.215
You didn't think
that's worth mentioning?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.883
I didn't want to
trouble you with it.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.652
Oh, that's very considerate
of you, thank you.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.622
They found a fucking Uzi
on one of your guys.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.390
That tends to get
people's attention.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.526
This the business we in, Reed.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.195
I've come to learn that shit's
just gonna happen.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.765
You familiar with
the Dade County shootout?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.901
Few years ago, Miami.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.169
Cubans, Colombians decided
they were gonna

09:29.202 --> 09:31.538
shoot it out midday
in a crowded shopping center.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.007
Now, the cops found
an armored car disguised

09:34.041 --> 09:35.575
as a party truck,
assault weapons, ammunition

09:35.609 --> 09:37.077
all over the parking lot.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.012
And it changed everything
because it brought

09:39.046 --> 09:41.214
the federal government out
in force.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.018
That was the beginning of the
end of the easy cocaine days

09:45.052 --> 09:46.854
-in South Florida.
-Yeah, but...

09:46.887 --> 09:48.488
Come on, man, it was one Uzi.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.724
You're overthinking this shit.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.025
Am I?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.294
Yeah.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.631
You know the cop that led
the raid, Sergeant Wright?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.133
He's trying to get your
case file unsealed.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.071
Hmm.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.707
He's from my neighborhood.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.441
Known him my whole life.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.443
Things have got
a bit personal lately,

10:10.477 --> 10:13.046
-but again, I'm handling it.
-How?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.916
Seems it might be better
if you didn't know.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.023
Look, you can be involved
if you really want.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.827
But it'd be better for everyone
if you just trust me.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.996
Huh?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.570
Okay.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.640
I'll be in touch soon
about next week's drop.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.813
Hey, Franklin?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.582
Good luck.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.325
(car door closes, engine starts)

11:08.068 --> 11:10.337
LOUIE:
Terrence in Gardena's
good for ten.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.072
FRANKLIN:
All right.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.174
Uh, Mookie said he can move
about five a week,

11:14.207 --> 11:16.109
maybe more, depending.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.678
All right, cool.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.281
So it's about 80 a week.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.483
What about Inglewood?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.923
What? Ain't nobody got
no connects in Inglewood?

11:31.258 --> 11:34.762
Ain't nothing going through
no goddamn Inglewood...

11:34.795 --> 11:35.963
without Skully.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.998
Skully. (chuckles) And?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.200
And we ain't got no connections
with Skully.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.603
Well, we kind of do.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.405
-Shut up, nigga.
-What?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.875
-Nigga, we do.
-What you talking about,
Fatback?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.442
Manboy.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.711
His sister is Skully's baby
mama. They stay in The Bottoms.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.880
(Franklin chuckles)

11:52.913 --> 11:55.715
Well, ain't that something.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.851
Leon, I need you
to link up with Manboy,

11:57.885 --> 11:59.386
-go handle that shit.
-Hell no.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.988
Hey, that shit
with Wanda's been dealt with.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.622
Okay? I ain't asking you

12:02.655 --> 12:05.258
to be that nigga's best friend,
but this is business,

12:05.292 --> 12:06.960
and I need you
to handle this shit.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.397
-All right?
-All right.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.800
FRANKLIN:
Good.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.202
All right, that's it for now.
Let's make this money.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.873
-Hey, nephew.
-(indistinct chatter)

12:19.907 --> 12:22.342
Hey, man.
Let me talk to you for a minute.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.811
Can it wait?

12:23.844 --> 12:26.579
Got to go see my moms, man,
already late.

12:26.613 --> 12:30.017
Okay.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.718
How you feeling?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.888
Looks worse than it is.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.193
Go on, man.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.262
All right.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.999
-I'm-a talk to you later.
-Yeah.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.048
Come in when you're done,
Sergeant.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.153
TODD:
It's not a good look,

13:06.186 --> 13:07.955
-Sergeant.
-The only thing that makes sense

13:07.988 --> 13:10.557
is that she drugged me.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.260
So what do you know
about this broad?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.795
-You ever seen her before?
-Can't say I have.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.499
What kind of drugs
were you two taking?

13:19.532 --> 13:23.904
What? No, I wasn't taking drugs.
I was drugged.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.074
Right. Right, sorry.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.176
(clears throat)
But, unfortunately,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.911
I'm gonna have to
bump this up to I.A.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.614
-(sighs) I.A.? For this?
-Yeah, I'm afraid so.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.284
My hands are kind of tied
on this one.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.119
If people see me
making exceptions

13:39.152 --> 13:40.453
for the big TV star,

13:40.487 --> 13:42.489
I mean, how's that gonna look?

13:44.791 --> 13:45.993
Mmm.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.968
-Hold up. You're not eating?
-I'm not hungry.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.144
You worried about the raids?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.812
The shit that happened
with Jerome?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.314
I don't want to talk about that.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.484
You know, all I'm saying
is we good.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.053
You know, there's nothing
that connects us.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.222
What did I say?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.992
All right.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.331
Let's talk real estate, then.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.969
Huh? You find out who outbid us
on that property?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.403
I did.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.708
And you're not gonna believe it.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.551
Where have you been?
I called the department.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.154
-Nobody knew where you were.
-I'm sorry, I...

14:47.187 --> 14:49.189
I'm fine.
I was just with the guys.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.025
-All night?
-Yeah.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.327
I had a few too many
and didn't want to drive,

14:54.361 --> 14:57.564
so I slept on Nix's couch.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.566
Daddy, it's 1:00
in the afternoon.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.335
You couldn't call me?

15:02.369 --> 15:04.604
I know, and I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.041
I thought something happened
to you. If I had done

15:08.075 --> 15:09.709
something like this,
you would've lost your mind,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.212
-had the whole department
looking for me.
-Because you're a child.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.881
And I'm the man of the house,
and I don't need to be

15:14.914 --> 15:17.650
-interrogated in my own home.
-Well, excuse me for worrying.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.724
-(refrigerator opens)
-A-Are you hungry?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.693
(sighs)

15:26.726 --> 15:28.795
You want me to fix you
something to eat?

15:28.828 --> 15:32.832
No. I just need
to get some sleep.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.601
(bottle opens)

15:40.807 --> 15:43.943
Uh... You know you left your bag

15:43.977 --> 15:46.079
sitting on top of the car.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.115
Oh, shit.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.499
(indistinct chatter in distance)

16:14.141 --> 16:16.143
*

16:28.821 --> 16:32.192
(car door closes, engine starts)

16:51.311 --> 16:53.313
(indistinct chatter nearby)

16:57.084 --> 16:59.286
You want to put your eyes
back in your head?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.520
(intercom beeps)

17:00.553 --> 17:02.589
TULFOWITZ:
Send them in.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.824
Mr. Tulfowitz will see you now.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.699
Thank you.
(clears throat)

17:19.706 --> 17:22.875
Well, there she is.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.546
Hello, Cissy.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.516
-(chuckles)
-Hello, Arnold.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.018
Franklin, good to see you, son.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.187
Whoa.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.523
It's been a while. (laughs)

17:36.556 --> 17:38.658
Have a seat. Have a seat,
please. Please, sit down.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.561
(chuckles)

17:41.594 --> 17:43.563
So...

17:43.596 --> 17:46.533
to what do I owe the pleasure?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.702
We want to talk to you about
the property on South Avalon.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.772
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.242
We're hoping you might
rescind your offer.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.447
You two were hoping
I might rescind my offer?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.415
-Mm-hmm.
-Why would I do that?

18:02.449 --> 18:03.916
Money,

18:03.950 --> 18:06.153
of course.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.020
We'll make it worth your while.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.423
You were the other bidder.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.660
You were why I paid 40K

18:13.693 --> 18:15.595
over asking. (chuckles)

18:15.628 --> 18:18.097
Son of a bitch.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.067
(laughs) And here I was
thinking you were coming in

18:21.100 --> 18:22.702
to beg for your old job back.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.205
(laughs)

18:25.238 --> 18:28.508
(laughs)
No. I work for myself now.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.777
Well, good for you.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.746
Look, we're willing to cut you
a check for $50,000

18:33.780 --> 18:36.849
-just to walk away.
-50 grand, huh?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.285
CISSY:
Arnold,

18:38.318 --> 18:41.087
we have a vested interest
in the property.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.822
We'd like to build up
the community.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.857
Provide decent housing
for low income families.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.894
Well, that's very commendable,

18:47.927 --> 18:50.129
but if you want it so bad,

18:50.163 --> 18:51.398
why didn't you just make
a better offer?

18:51.431 --> 18:54.066
We would have.
It was a timing issue.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.135
Timing, yeah.
Timing's everything,

18:56.169 --> 18:59.272
-isn't it?
-Look, just name your price

18:59.306 --> 19:01.073
and you can walk away with

19:01.107 --> 19:02.675
a chunk of change
for doing nothing.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.978
Did you guys win the lottery

19:06.012 --> 19:07.914
-or something?
-(Franklin laughs)

19:07.947 --> 19:10.283
Is there a-a rich uncle
you didn't know about?

19:10.317 --> 19:13.453
-Something like that.
-Well, uh,

19:13.486 --> 19:16.122
I wish I could help you, Cissy,
I really do,

19:16.155 --> 19:19.759
but this-this property,
it-it means a lot to me, too.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.528
You know, you're not
the only ones who care

19:21.561 --> 19:24.130
-about the black community.
-CISSY: Yeah.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.299
You're a real man of the people.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.669
(scoffs)
What's that supposed to mean?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.772
I love the blacks,
you know that.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.642
Arnold,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.844
I worked for you
for a long time.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.613
Long enough to know
all about the payoffs

19:40.647 --> 19:43.950
to Building & Safety,
the asbestos,

19:43.983 --> 19:48.187
the mold that you
just painted over.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.657
You know as well as I do,
those buildings

19:50.690 --> 19:53.092
are a lawsuit waiting to happen.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.196
Well, sweetheart,
if you know me so well,

19:57.230 --> 19:58.698
then you know, uh,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.833
I don't take too kindly
to threats.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.672
And I don't care how much money
you've made snatching hubcaps,

20:05.705 --> 20:07.340
or dealing smack,

20:07.374 --> 20:11.411
or whatever it is that
you people are involved with.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.480
You will never make enough money

20:13.513 --> 20:17.016
to muscle me
out of a fucking deal!

20:17.049 --> 20:21.053
Now get the fuck
out of my office.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.868
CISSY:
Franklin.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.753
-Think that'll do it?
-Absolutely.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.523
-I like his new wig.
-(both laugh)

20:56.556 --> 20:58.891
How many drinks did you have?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.894
-I don't know. A few.
-How often do you drink?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.597
Not often.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.633
Just special occasions, huh?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.768
Whose decision was it
to go to the hotel?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.071
Mine.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.606
VASQUEZ:
Was there any money exchanged?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.207
No, she wasn't a prostitute.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.909
You sure about that?

21:16.943 --> 21:20.380
Hey, there's no need for that.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.883
Guys, this was a setup.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.152
I was targeted.
That woman, she drugged me.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.587
The tox screen will prove it.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.021
Targeted? By who?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.858
I just said it, man, the woman.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.761
Is there anybody else who might
have reason to come after you?

21:39.165 --> 21:42.569
I don't know.
I lock up a lot of bad people.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.972
Are you aware that you're named

21:46.005 --> 21:47.774
in three active lawsuits
against the department?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.443
MCKAY:
Property damage,
excessive force.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.945
VASQUEZ:
One of them claims that you held
a woman without cause

21:52.979 --> 21:54.347
for 24 hours.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.983
Says that she had to piss
in a wastebasket

21:57.016 --> 21:59.486
-while she was in your custody.
-That was a mistake.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.053
Some might call it
a civil rights violation.

22:01.087 --> 22:05.291
This is bullshit.
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.325
Steve.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.395
Are you gonna do something
or are you just

22:08.428 --> 22:10.397
-gonna sit there and watch?
-Yes.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.998
Can we please keep
the questions limited

22:12.031 --> 22:13.866
to the case at hand?

22:13.900 --> 22:15.935
ANDRE:
Damn. I'm a good cop.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.604
Just ask anybody.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.138
Sergeant Wright.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.973
We're just trying to get
a clear picture

22:21.007 --> 22:22.375
of who you are.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.810
Unfortunately, there seems to be

22:23.843 --> 22:26.413
a pattern of questionable
behavior here.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.748
We need to take a look at that.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.811

to pull this bitch.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.379
Bitch, you're a horse.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.914
Fucking up my suspension.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.821
This some bullshit.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.357
(indistinct chatter)

23:11.390 --> 23:12.992
Hey, look, I know
you ain't trying to be here.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.228
I need you to check yourself
before we walk in there.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.397
-Fuck you mean, check myself?
-I mean,

23:18.431 --> 23:19.899
you need to
cheer the fuck up, nigga.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.501

ain't about to fly

23:24.971 --> 23:27.574

anything could set him off.

Like, I mean, like,
real-life crazy, nigga.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.045
* On earth who can compete *

25:48.547 --> 25:50.482
* You know it *

25:50.516 --> 25:52.218
* I want you *

25:52.251 --> 25:53.485
* Egyptian Lover *

25:55.221 --> 25:56.923
Mm-hmm.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.324
For real?

25:59.692 --> 26:02.394
Okay, okay.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.163
Shit...

26:04.196 --> 26:06.666
-Hey, y'all heard that?
-MANBOY: Nigga, can't nobody

26:06.699 --> 26:07.867
hear shit over this music.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.036
Turn that shit down.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.070
(music stops)

26:15.742 --> 26:17.409
You ain't hear that shit?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.179
What is it?

26:20.212 --> 26:21.714
(shushes)

26:24.216 --> 26:26.218
Shit.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.757
(muffled grunting)

26:30.790 --> 26:32.759
SKULLY:
Didn't I tell you
to shut the fuck up?

26:32.792 --> 26:35.261
-(blows landing)
-Shut your bitch-ass mouth!

26:35.294 --> 26:37.363
-(clattering, blows landing)
-Bitch, don't even breathe!

26:37.396 --> 26:39.766
Do you understand me?
Fuck your life!

26:39.799 --> 26:42.601
(metallic clinking)

26:42.635 --> 26:45.905
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Shut up now.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.407
Cut that shit back on.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.042
* Total female population... *

26:50.076 --> 26:52.111
(whoops)
I love this shit!

26:52.144 --> 26:54.113
-* I don't care
about my reputation *
-(grunting)

26:54.146 --> 26:55.748
* Give me a freaky,
kinky nation *

26:55.782 --> 26:57.750
* With a total female
population *

26:57.784 --> 26:59.485
* I can deal
with that situation *

26:59.518 --> 27:01.520
* I don't care
about my reputation *

27:01.553 --> 27:03.589
* I'm the Egyptian Lover *

27:03.622 --> 27:05.424
* Sexy Senior *

27:05.457 --> 27:06.826
-That's my shit!
-* It's not just a name *

27:06.859 --> 27:08.961
* It's an adventure *

27:08.995 --> 27:10.797
-(exhales)
-* I mix so fast *

27:10.830 --> 27:12.732
* I scratch so sweet... *

27:12.765 --> 27:14.466
So how much weight we talking?

27:14.500 --> 27:17.503
* Who can compete. *

27:25.444 --> 27:26.645
HAVEMEYER:
Any idea how your husband

27:26.679 --> 27:29.648
got the kid's case tossed?

27:29.682 --> 27:31.283
Ex-husband.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.753
The DEA agent
who witnessed the shooting

27:33.786 --> 27:35.654
recanted her statement.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.056
(sighs)

27:37.089 --> 27:39.158
I got to hand it to him.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.127
Teddy's doing
a better job than I thought.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.162
From where I'm standing,
we're exposed

27:43.195 --> 27:45.064
in a million different ways
on this.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.665
-MAN: Order up.
-(bell dings)

27:48.134 --> 27:50.937
Every one of his assets
is totally disposable.

27:50.970 --> 27:54.173
This black kid, the Israeli,
the Mexicans.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.443
Any of them ever go public,
no one would ever believe 'em.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.715
I guess Teddy's
disposable, too, huh?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.185
That's how he sold us
on letting him

28:06.218 --> 28:08.354
run with this thing
in the first place.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.922
So, how long...

28:09.956 --> 28:12.024
before you know
all the principals,

28:12.058 --> 28:13.492
can start running them?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.830
It's hard to say.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.166
He still trusts you, right?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.903
Yeah.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.173
Yeah, he trusts me.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.710
Motherfucker had a hostage
chained up in the bathroom.

28:31.744 --> 28:34.146
-And a grenade.
-A grenade?

28:34.180 --> 28:36.048
Yeah, nigga, a grenade
sitting right there

28:36.082 --> 28:39.351
on the fucking coffee table.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.255
Well, what y'all
looking at me for?

28:43.289 --> 28:45.157
Told you he was crazy.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.259
The cost to do business
in Inglewood.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.363
How much weight can he move?

28:51.397 --> 28:53.766
Said he want 20 birds a week.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.468
Hmm.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.471
20 keys sound great till you the
nigga tied up in the bathroom.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.209
-You think you can handle him?
-MANBOY: I can handle it.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.044
Good.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.745
Make it work.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.247
MANBOY:
Cool.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.917
(chuckles)

29:13.285 --> 29:16.789
Lee, got to get to my mom's.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.825
Come on.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.698
ANDRE:
Melody, yo, open up.

29:26.732 --> 29:29.068
Now, you know we don't do
locked doors in this house.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.004
Uh, just one second.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.712
Pack your bags.
You're leaving in two days.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.382
Two days? What you mean?
I thought we were driving?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.084
(sighs)
Change of plans, all right?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.785
You're gonna be staying
with your Aunt Bernice

29:46.819 --> 29:49.721
-until the dorms open up.
-But I don't even know her.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.523
Well, this will be
your opportunity to change that.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.092
But why, Daddy?
This don't make no sense.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.660
Look, I don't want to argue,
I don't want to argue.

29:54.693 --> 29:57.729
I made a decision. Now, you best
get your bags packed

29:57.763 --> 29:59.765
and say your goodbyes.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.862
*

30:52.818 --> 30:54.820
*

31:13.705 --> 31:14.806
(groaning softly)

31:14.840 --> 31:17.143
(siren wailing in distance)

31:20.646 --> 31:23.615
("No Tears" by
The Psychedelic Furs playing)

31:27.053 --> 31:30.722
* There's demonstrations *

31:30.756 --> 31:34.793
* And demonstrations *

31:34.826 --> 31:36.362
* Listen to the weathermen... *

31:36.395 --> 31:38.730
(whistles)

31:38.764 --> 31:41.867
* They're not saying anything *

31:41.900 --> 31:45.671
* They're tripping flags
for you *

31:45.704 --> 31:50.042
* This crazy face for you *

31:50.076 --> 31:51.110
* You don't have
a point of view... *

31:51.143 --> 31:52.478
You got a page.

* Yeah. *

(line ringing)

32:11.863 --> 32:13.032
Hello?

32:13.065 --> 32:15.434
Cocaine never dropped, amigo.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.902
TEDDY:
Gustavo?

32:16.935 --> 32:20.072
At the farm in Sinaloa,
people waited all day.

32:20.106 --> 32:23.042
-(speaks Spanish)
-Okay.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.276
Look, it's probably just
a miscommunication.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.544
Let me check
with the Colombians.

32:25.577 --> 32:26.778
I'll get back to you.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.380
Orale.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.416
All right.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.620
What's up?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.655
(synth pop playing)

32:51.770 --> 32:54.406
* Call it interaction *

33:02.014 --> 33:04.983
Ah, my friend. Please.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.985
-Hola.
-Join us.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.588
Hello. Mind if we talk
in private?

33:09.621 --> 33:12.424
Really? Always business
with you, brother?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.260
Uh, sorry.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.128
Okay.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.298
Adiós, mamacita.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.932
Thank you.

33:20.966 --> 33:25.204
I love that.
I love that.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.406

*

33:32.511 --> 33:34.880
Where is Matt and the DEA girl?

33:34.913 --> 33:38.016
Uh, we're not gonna be
working together anymore.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.052
That's too bad. I liked them.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.820
(chuckles)

33:41.853 --> 33:44.490
-Should I be worried, brother?
-Oh, no.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.126
-You have nothing
to worry about. No.
-Sure?

33:47.159 --> 33:48.960
-I promise.
-Okay.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.331
Do you want a line?

33:52.364 --> 33:55.033
-Oh, no, thank you. I'm good.
-I insist.

33:55.067 --> 33:58.237
-Really, I'm good.
-Do the fucking line.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.172
*

34:04.042 --> 34:06.011
Okay.

34:13.785 --> 34:16.021
(sniffing)

34:18.690 --> 34:20.326
The other side.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.728
Para emparejar, papi.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.763
(sighs)

34:27.433 --> 34:29.034
(sniffs)

34:29.067 --> 34:32.037
(laughs)

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
Good, right?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.409
Yeah.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.846
Yeah.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.449
(speaks Spanish)

34:43.482 --> 34:44.883
(sniffs)

34:44.916 --> 34:47.953
(laughing):
Oh!

34:47.986 --> 34:49.188
Ay!

34:49.221 --> 34:53.024
(speaking Spanish)

34:53.058 --> 34:54.693
(coughs)

34:54.726 --> 34:56.662
-You like this place?
-Sure.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.765
Listen, we got to talk...
about the drops.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.868
My people in Mexico
have been waiting.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.271
It was supposed to arrive
two days ago.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.306
Where's my club?

35:07.339 --> 35:10.442
-Sorry, what?
-My club.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.278
Sorry, our club.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.380
Rigo and Reed's.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.583
Oh, right. That's...
no, I'm working on that.

35:17.616 --> 35:21.253
I mean, is that why
you're not making the drops?

35:21.287 --> 35:25.123
I'll resume the drops
when you get me my fucking club.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.261
Uh... Okay, Jesus.

35:29.295 --> 35:30.796
Rigo, listen,
I'm, I'm working on it.

35:30.829 --> 35:34.132
It's just gonna take me
a little longer, you know?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.034
I'm looking for the right place.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.736
I already found it.

35:37.769 --> 35:41.273
Helena's, on, on...
on Temple Street?

35:41.307 --> 35:44.109
-Helena's?
-Where Jack Nicholson hangs out.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.144
That's the fucking club I want.

35:46.178 --> 35:49.147
Great, yeah. That's, you know,
it's gonna be tough,

35:49.181 --> 35:51.283
but that's-- yeah,
I'll-I'll check on that.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.585
In the meantime...

35:53.619 --> 35:55.221
(sniffs)

35:55.254 --> 35:58.490
...could you please start
making the drops again?

35:58.524 --> 36:03.795
No club, no cocaine, hermano.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.565
*

36:27.986 --> 36:30.522
*

36:45.904 --> 36:46.972
Wait!

36:50.742 --> 36:52.177
You okay?

36:56.682 --> 36:58.317
(grunts)

36:58.350 --> 37:01.219
Yeah.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.221
You were talking in your sleep.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.893
Oh, yeah?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.328
(clears throat)

37:09.361 --> 37:10.962
What'd I say?

37:10.996 --> 37:13.532
You said "Wait."

37:24.376 --> 37:27.379
Tulfowitz pulled out.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.081
Got the call today.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.750
The building's ours.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.920
(laughs softly)

37:34.953 --> 37:36.955
That's great.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.426
Right?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.694
Mm-hmm.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.132
Come on, Mama.

37:51.403 --> 37:55.541
That man treated you
like a slave for 15 years.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.109
Took advantage of good,
honest people.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.111
Shit, he sent men over here
to mess us up,

38:00.145 --> 38:01.613
and we took care of them.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.682
You mean to tell me
it don't feel great

38:03.715 --> 38:05.283
to put that asshole
in his place?

38:05.317 --> 38:07.953
-Franklin...
-Come on.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.456
I mean, even just a little bit.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.290
Just the tiniest bit great, huh?

38:12.324 --> 38:14.292
-(laughs)
-Boy, get out my face.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.328
Mwah.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.833
We did it.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.639
You did it.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.675
Later, Mama.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.346
(door opens)

38:36.382 --> 38:39.385
-How'd it go?
-Not great. Not great.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.252
Could've been, you know,
could've been better, but

38:41.286 --> 38:43.288
it's like...
Here's the thing I realized.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.323
These people, they don't want
to listen to reason,

38:45.357 --> 38:46.692
so you can't reason with them.

38:46.725 --> 38:47.993
Like, I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.995
What am I surprised about, even?

38:50.028 --> 38:51.663
I should just be relieved
that he didn't try

38:51.697 --> 38:53.699
-to force me to do more cocaine.
-You did cocaine?

38:53.732 --> 38:55.967
Mm. I did cocaine.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.503
I did cocaine.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.337
I mean, I didn't want to, but
he insisted, and I'm... like,

38:59.371 --> 39:00.506
I'm sitting there,
and I'm thinking, you know,

39:00.539 --> 39:01.940
if-if that's
what it's gonna take to get

39:01.973 --> 39:03.308
the drops back on, then, yeah,
I'll do the fucking cocaine.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.911
-So the drops are back on?
-No!

39:05.944 --> 39:08.246
The-the drops are not back on,
Julia, that's what I'm saying.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.281
-Are you listening to me?
-I'm listening to you.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.651
Calm down. Jesus, take a breath.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.655
(exhaling)

39:16.688 --> 39:18.457
Sorry.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.858
Okay.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.360
I know that I said
that I didn't want you

39:22.394 --> 39:24.530
to meet with the Colombians,
but I do think

39:24.563 --> 39:26.965
-that I'm gonna need
your help on this.
-Sure.

39:26.998 --> 39:30.168
I... That's what I'm here for.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.203
What do you need?

39:32.237 --> 39:35.206
(sunglasses clatter)

39:35.240 --> 39:37.576
What do you know
about nightclubs?

39:37.609 --> 39:39.611
(siren wailing in distance)

39:52.424 --> 39:54.392
-What's wrong?
-My daddy acting crazy.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.394
He's sending me to Spelman
this weekend.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.396
-How come?
-I don't know.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.398
-Well, ask him.
-SHON-SHON: Hey, One Time!

40:00.432 --> 40:02.167
The fuck you doing here, bitch?

40:02.200 --> 40:04.069
-"Bitch"?
-You know your daddy
and the rest

40:04.102 --> 40:07.172
of them pigs snatched up
my cousin, fucked up his house.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.740
-What you got to say about that?
-EVA: Stop tripping,

40:08.774 --> 40:10.375
Shon-Shon.
You know she ain't got nothing

40:10.408 --> 40:12.010
-to do with that.
-The fuck she don't.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.645
I'm gonna go.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.814
-Hey, I'm talking to you!
-Shon-Shon...

40:15.847 --> 40:18.684
Don't walk away from me.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.186
I ain't doing this with you,
Shon-Shon.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.721
-Yes, you is.
-What?

40:22.754 --> 40:24.556
-What the fuck?
-Bitch!

40:24.590 --> 40:25.691
(grunting, thuds)

40:30.762 --> 40:32.931
You want one?

40:32.964 --> 40:34.966
Nah, I'm good.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.108
-Look...
-Before you say anything,

40:43.141 --> 40:47.112
I just want to say
I appreciate you.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.048
I know, a lot of people
take a beating like that,

40:50.081 --> 40:52.083
they want out the game.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.392
I'm concerned
about my shop, nephew.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.031
I put a lot of money in that
thing. I need it to work out.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.769
You and Cissy,
you got the real estate thing.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.237
Louie got the club.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.973
Jammin' Jeromes?

41:15.006 --> 41:17.408
That's my shit.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.279
Need to give it
my full attention.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.749
Can't be no old nigga

41:23.782 --> 41:25.751
out here slinging rocks
on the block, man.

41:25.784 --> 41:29.154
Man, that's why I'm trying to
get this wholesale thing going.

41:29.187 --> 41:33.592
So we can make that money and
never have to be on the street.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.127
L.A. first, then we'll expand.

41:36.161 --> 41:40.198
Detroit, New York, Chicago.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.434
Making money
and staying in the house.

41:43.468 --> 41:45.436
Like them
white motherfuckers do. Huh?

41:45.470 --> 41:48.473
-We ain't no goddamn
white motherfuckers.
-Listen, Unc.

41:50.508 --> 41:55.113
We close, so close,
but we're not there yet.

41:55.146 --> 41:58.483
And I need you in this with me.

41:59.484 --> 42:02.053
All right?

42:03.789 --> 42:07.158
I remember when you were
selling dime bags of shake.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.860
(laughs)

42:08.894 --> 42:10.962
Yeah, that I got from you.

42:13.098 --> 42:15.533
We gonna be all right.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.170
I got you.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.539
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

42:45.597 --> 42:47.699
(sighs)
What's up, Sarge?

42:47.733 --> 42:52.303
What are you doing out here?

42:52.337 --> 42:54.305
Rat Squad go hard on you
or what?

42:56.374 --> 42:58.509
I'm suspended.

43:00.545 --> 43:04.916
(exhales) Fucking Todd,
that piece of shit.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.919
I need you to do something
for me, Nix.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.021
Name it.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.025
I'm gonna bury Franklin Saint.

43:16.227 --> 43:18.396
About fucking time.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.065
What are you thinking?

43:20.098 --> 43:22.500
Can't plant evidence on him.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.103
Kid's got somebody up high
protecting him.

43:25.136 --> 43:26.772
And everybody knows
I'm gunning for him,

43:26.805 --> 43:30.008
so we got to tread lightly.

43:30.041 --> 43:33.611
I'm-a need you to find out
where he lays his head.

43:33.645 --> 43:37.615
He's not staying with his uncle
or his mama anymore.

43:37.649 --> 43:40.385
I can do that. Then what?

43:43.922 --> 43:46.091
Then get your wife and kids
out of town

43:46.124 --> 43:51.362
for a couple of days,
and we go to work.
