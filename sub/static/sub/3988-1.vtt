01:44.105 --> 01:46.096
(theme music playing )

02:30.067 --> 02:31.147
You didn't wake me up.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.561
'Cause I knew you were up all night
reading comics with a flashlight.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.196
Carl:
What's up with Violet?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.452
Carl, I told you
not to name them.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.704
They're not piglets anymore.
They're food.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.662
ljust thought,
you know, until...

02:50.171 --> 02:52.002
Okay.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.299
I don't know
what's going on with her.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.132
Could be sick,
could be nothing.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.921
(clicking tongue)

03:02.099 --> 03:04.135
Feel better, Violet.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.059
Come on, let's get to it.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.639
- Morning, Daryl.
- What's up, Dr. S?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.227
- Man: Morning, Daryl.
- Man #2: Morning, Daryl.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.812
Woman:
Hey, Daryl!

03:14.987 --> 03:17.194
Smells good.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.731
Just so you know,
I liked you first.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.524
Stop.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.782
You know, Rick brought in
a lot of them, too.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.663
Not recently.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.418
Give the stranger sanctuary,
keeping people fed,

03:32.588 --> 03:34.203
you're gonna have to learn
to live with the love.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.998
- Right.
- I need you to see something.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.541
Patrick, you want to take over?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.380
Yes, ma'am.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.009
Mr. Dixon,

03:45.184 --> 03:48.221
ljust wanted to thank you for bringing
that deer back yesterday.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.432
It was a real treat, sir.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.813
And I'd be honored
to shake your hand.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.370
(growling)

04:43.159 --> 04:45.070
About today,

04:45.244 --> 04:48.657
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to spare a lot of people for the run.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.867
That place is good to go.
We're gonna move on it.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.123
Yeah.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.457
The thing is, we had
a pretty big buildup overnight.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.882
Dozens more
towards tower three.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.166
It's getting as bad
as last month.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.880
They don't spread out
anymore.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.511
With more of us sitting here,
we're drawing more of them out.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.424
You get enough of those damn
fence-clingers, they start to herd up.

05:09.602 --> 05:11.513
Pushing against
the fences again.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.724
lt's manageable, but unless
we get ahead of it, not for long.

05:14.899 --> 05:16.855
Sorry, Pookie.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.226
( scoffs )

05:20.404 --> 05:22.235
(snarling )

05:31.081 --> 05:32.241
You like that?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.512
(sighs)

06:01.362 --> 06:03.728
I don't think
you should go today.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.981
Really?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.696
Yeah.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.535
We have the suits.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.745
Yeah, but you don't
have to go.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.706
You shouldn't.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.295
You know everything's
gonna work out, right?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.049
Right?

06:30.432 --> 06:32.047
Right.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.717
Right.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.887
But you're staying, okay?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.020
Fine.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.320
Hey, beautiful.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.151
Hey yourself.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.987
- You need an apron.
- Yeah.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.413
Listen, can we talk?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.618
l was thinking of going
on the run today.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.206
Okay.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.248
I don't like killing
them on the fence.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.212
I hate it.

07:07.386 --> 07:11.004
I mean, when they're coming at you
out there, it's different.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.842
You don't even
think about it.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.554
When they're stacked up
against the chain-link,

07:15.728 --> 07:18.561
you're just face-to-face.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.483
ljust wanted to do something different
to help out.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.231
You always volunteered
to do it.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.400
That's because you
were always doing it.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.660
( laughs)

07:34.830 --> 07:37.492
Just thought I could
get to know you.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.620
You did.

07:46.759 --> 07:49.421
You be careful out there.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.766
Hey.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.976
lwasjust gonna
come find you.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.944
- Hi.
- What's up?

08:09.114 --> 08:12.277
Well, the council pulled back everyone
on the coal crew

08:12.451 --> 08:14.157
from going on the run.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.943
They're shorthanded
right now.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.237
I figured I'd step up
to help, go with 'em.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.575
Just, you know, wanted to make sure
that I saw you before.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.248
Okay.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.753
ljust--
'cause, you know,

08:26.924 --> 08:29.165
it's dangerous
going out there.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.584
I know.
( kisses )

08:34.431 --> 08:36.137
Okay, are you
gonna say good-bye?

08:36.308 --> 08:37.764
Nope.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.051
It's like a damn
romance novel.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.607
Hey.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.612
I'd like to start pulling
my weight around here.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.023
Bob, it's only been a week.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.862
That's a week
worth of meals,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.947
a roof over my head.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.908
Let me earn my keep.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.250
You were out on your own
when Daryl found you.

09:05.421 --> 09:07.036
- That's right.
- | just want to make sure

09:07.214 --> 09:08.499
you know how to play on a team.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.255
We ain't gonna do it
unless it's easy.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.166
You know he was
a medic in the Army.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.219
You a hell of a tough sell.
You know that?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.684
Okay.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.641
(engines start)

09:26.024 --> 09:28.401
These leaves are gonna be
in the shade,

09:28.569 --> 09:31.527
so we won't get
any good fruit from it.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.689
So we just pinch
it off here.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.693
Things break,
but they can still grow.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.784
These little bristles,
they'll take root

09:42.958 --> 09:44.949
and we'll have
a whole new plant.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.619
Rick:
Let's go.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.835
(growling)

10:01.226 --> 10:03.262
(grunts)

10:23.540 --> 10:24.916
We're glad to see you.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.165
Glad to see you, too.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.042
Somebody hit
the jackpot.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.953
No way.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.543
Awesome!
Thank you.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.957
| get to read 'em
when you're done.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.626
And I found this.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.178
Your face
is losing the war.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.683
( chuckles )

10:44.853 --> 10:47.265
You gonna stay
a little while?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.304
Just a little while.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.064
( motorcycle rewing )

10:58.283 --> 11:00.239
Well, look who's back.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.901
Didn't find him.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.951
Glad to see you
in one piece.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.990
I'm thinking of looking
over near Macon.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.331
It's worth a shot.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.542
Daryl:
70 miles of walkers.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.332
You might run into
a few unneighborly types.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.217
Is it?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.340
I'm gonna go check out
the Big Spot.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.100
The one l was talking about,
just seeing.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.683
Rick: Yeah, I got to go out
and check the snares.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.269
I don't want to lose whatever
we catch to the walkers.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.648
I'll go.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.355
You just got here.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.191
And I'll be back.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.695
( revs motor )

11:42.870 --> 11:45.111
(engine starts)

11:48.750 --> 11:50.786
(growling)

11:54.590 --> 11:56.581
- Going to check the snares?
- I am.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.249
You're not.
Do your chores.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.669
Read comics.
Maybe some books, too.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.088
Hang out with Patrick.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.131
Maybe go to story time.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.266
Dad, that's for kids.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.177
Yeah.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.684
Now brush her down.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.738
Nothing wrong with
staying close, Rick.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.198
Everyone understands.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.908
You're growing us
enough food

12:29.082 --> 12:31.118
so we won't need
to do runs soon.

12:31.293 --> 12:34.456
But we do have to find you
a good pair of overalls.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.871
You need to look
the part.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.165
A little piece of wheat
out of the corner of your mouth.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.674
Maybe a bigger ass.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.551
( laughs )
Yeah.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.135
Listen, the rest
of the council--

12:47.309 --> 12:50.016
Daryl, Glenn,
Carol, Sasha,

12:50.187 --> 12:53.304
all of them--

12:53.482 --> 12:55.598
they wanted me
to talk to you.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.358
When you go out there,

12:58.528 --> 13:00.519
you got to take your gun.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.313
-( horse snorts)
- Easy now.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.653
It's just
outside the fence.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.783
l have my knife.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.446
| get in trouble, six bullets
isn't gonna make the difference.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.333
Rick, we want you
to be safe.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.995
Bring your gun.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.337
(flies buzzing )

13:40.153 --> 13:43.145
(grunting)

13:51.081 --> 13:52.241
( rustling )

14:01.133 --> 14:03.124
Wait.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.131
Please.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.802
Please?

14:19.985 --> 14:22.146
Please help me.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.816
I know you don't
know me.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.827
Okay, I know that.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.660
But can you please help me
get this to my husband?

14:37.335 --> 14:40.042
We haven't eaten in days.

15:02.486 --> 15:05.148
Here. Go ahead.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.532
Thank you.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.916
Do you have a camp
around here?

15:28.845 --> 15:31.336
Yeah.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.099
Could we possibly
come back with you?

15:37.604 --> 15:40.391
We've been doing...

15:40.565 --> 15:43.147
very badly on our own.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.529
I'd have to meet him.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.364
I need to ask him some questions,
both of you.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.080
What questions?

16:03.213 --> 16:05.829
Just three.
When we get there.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.167
You have a gun
on you?

16:11.346 --> 16:13.337
Can I make sure?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.100
Yeah.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.647
Look, I don't know you,

16:27.821 --> 16:30.654
so I'm just gonna
tell you this.

16:30.824 --> 16:34.237
You try anything--

16:35.996 --> 16:37.577
anything--

16:40.000 --> 16:42.537
you're gonna be
the one who loses.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.837
I don't have
anything else to lose.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.791
No.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.210
You do.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.049
Go ahead.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.272
(growling)

17:10.447 --> 17:12.108
Child:
Nick, look over here.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.238
Child #2:
This one's Wayne.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.489
- Nick.
- Nick, over here.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.820
Hi, Nick!

17:16.995 --> 17:19.077
- Hi, Nick.
- Carl: You're naming them?

17:19.247 --> 17:21.454
Well, one of them
has a name tag,

17:21.625 --> 17:24.207
so we thought
all of them should.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.789
They had names when they were alive.
They're dead now.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.249
No, they're not.
They're just different.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.755
What the hell
are you talking about?

17:30.926 --> 17:32.837
Okay, they don't talk.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.844
They don't think.
They eat people.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.345
They kill people.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.426
People kill people.
They still have names.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.341
Have you seen
what happens?

17:41.519 --> 17:43.555
Have you seen someone
die like that?

17:43.730 --> 17:47.348
Yeah, I have.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.562
They're not people
and they're not pets.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.023
Don't name them.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.448
We're supposed to go read.
Come on.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.029
You coming to
story time tonight?

18:03.208 --> 18:06.166
Uh, yeah.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.542
See you then.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.214
| go sometimes.
I'm immature.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.922
You wouldn't dig it.
It's for kids.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.508
I'm gonna head
up there, too.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.423
l'll catch you later,
young sir.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.557
Yep.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.684
Army came in
and put these fences up.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.686
Made it a place
for the people to go.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.848
Last week when we
spotted this place,

18:30.026 --> 18:32.358
there was a bunch of walkers
behind this chain-link

18:32.529 --> 18:35.692
keeping people out
like a bunch of guard dogs.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.196
( music blaring
over radio )

18:37.367 --> 18:38.857
So they all just left?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.741
Give a listen.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.777
( music continues playing )

18:42.956 --> 18:44.696
You drew 'em out.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.535
Put a boom box out there
three days ago.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.666
Hooked it up
to two car batteries.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.670
All right,
let's make a sweep.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.831
Make sure it's safe.
Grab what you can.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.545
We'll come back tomorrow
with more people.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.646
Come on.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.275
(pounding)

19:21.453 --> 19:23.535
Just give it a second.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.911
Okay, I think
I got it.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.997
Got what?

19:32.172 --> 19:35.505
I've been trying to guess what Daryl
did before the turn.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.586
He's been trying to guess
for, like, six weeks.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.547
Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.507
One shot a day.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.672
All right, shoot.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.889
Well, the way you are
at the prison,

19:49.064 --> 19:51.771
you being on the council,
you're able to track,

19:51.941 --> 19:55.149
you're helping people,
but you're still being kind of...

19:56.446 --> 19:57.561
surly.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.814
Big swing here.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.109
Homicide cop.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.948
(laughing)

20:06.956 --> 20:08.366
What's so funny?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.533
Nothing.
It makes perfect sense.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.747
Actually,
the man's right.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.833
Undercover.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.754
- Come on, really?
- Yep.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.543
I don't like to talk about it

20:21.721 --> 20:24.713
'cause it was a lot
of heavy shit, you know?

20:27.519 --> 20:29.510
Dude, come on, really?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.305
( clears throat )

20:33.483 --> 20:35.974
Okay. I'll just keep
guessing, I guess.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.688
- Yeah, you keep doing that.
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.727
(snarling )

20:39.906 --> 20:42.238
- We're gonna do this, Detective?
- Let's do it.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.195
( doors open )

20:47.664 --> 20:50.872
All right, we go in,
stay in formation for the sweep.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.703
After that, you all know
what you're supposed to look for.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.333
Any questions?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.210
Was there ever a time
that you weren't the boss of me?

20:56.381 --> 20:57.871
You had a few years
before I was born.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.811
(growling)

21:35.712 --> 21:38.829
(birds chirping)

21:39.007 --> 21:42.124
We were going
to Puerto Vallarta

21:42.302 --> 21:44.293
for our honeymoon.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.213
When they shut down
the airports,

21:47.390 --> 21:50.302
our connecting flight
never connected.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.561
They wouldn't let us
leave the terminal, so...

21:56.024 --> 21:59.141
we slept
next to these huge

21:59.319 --> 22:02.402
marble sculptures
from Zimbabwe.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.865
Then,
on the fourth night,

22:07.035 --> 22:10.368
the things
just came through.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.779
There were
a lot of us and...

22:14.292 --> 22:16.533
now it's just
Eddie and me.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.078
And lwouldn't
have made it

22:20.256 --> 22:22.372
if it wasn't for him.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.633
And it isn't that...

22:28.014 --> 22:32.383
he saved me
over and over again

22:32.560 --> 22:35.051
or that he showed me
the things

22:35.230 --> 22:38.222
that I had to do or...

22:38.399 --> 22:40.390
to be willing to do.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.061
If he wasn't still here...

22:45.240 --> 22:48.448
|-- I couldn't be.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.618
ljust-- I couldn't.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.701
What were they?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.376
What?

22:58.920 --> 23:01.787
The things you had
to be willing to do?

23:01.965 --> 23:03.626
Um...

23:03.800 --> 23:07.008
eating whatever
we could find--

23:07.178 --> 23:09.294
animal carcasses

23:09.472 --> 23:12.464
and rotten fruit-- and...

23:13.893 --> 23:16.305
leaving people behind.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.981
Hiding from people
who needed my help.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.061
Unlike you.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.783
This is not charity.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.819
You have to have numbers.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.660
People are the best
defense against walkers

23:37.834 --> 23:39.790
or people.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.701
We help each other.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.299
You call them "walkers"?

25:21.396 --> 25:23.102
(yelling)

25:23.272 --> 25:25.524
(growling)

25:39.414 --> 25:41.075
You all right?
You cut or something?

25:41.249 --> 25:43.240
No, man, but my foot is caught.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.080
All right. He'sjust caught.
Come on, help me up.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.414
- Glenn: What happened?
- Everyone's all right.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.964
We're over in wine and beer.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.923
( roof creaking )

25:56.097 --> 25:59.089
l was moving fast, man.
I drove right into the drinks.

25:59.267 --> 26:02.430
Man, you lucked out. If this thing had
come down on you the wrong way...

26:13.364 --> 26:15.355
(snarling )

26:15.533 --> 26:17.649
Yeah, uh, we should
probably go now.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.408
Bob's still stuck.
Get him out of there.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.240
We'll get the others.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.255
Hey!

26:48.524 --> 26:52.517
I saw those sculptures
at the airport once.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.607
My favorite was the kids
playing leapfrog.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.569
Mine, too.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.286
What Eddie and I had to do,

27:04.457 --> 27:07.039
did you do things like that?

27:10.421 --> 27:12.252
Did you?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.588
Do you think you get
to come back from them?

27:21.474 --> 27:23.931
I hope so.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.637
Yeah?

27:25.812 --> 27:28.474
I hope we answer
your three questions

27:28.648 --> 27:30.639
to your satisfaction.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.191
(growling)

27:47.750 --> 27:49.957
(grunting)

27:50.127 --> 27:53.255
(snarling )

27:58.928 --> 28:01.419
(grunting)

28:17.905 --> 28:20.647
(machine-gun gunfire)

28:20.825 --> 28:22.611
( clicks )

28:41.220 --> 28:43.336
Hey!

28:43.514 --> 28:45.596
(growling)

28:47.935 --> 28:49.550
Hey!

29:17.506 --> 29:18.632
Daryl, go!

29:32.104 --> 29:34.686
(gunfire)

29:34.857 --> 29:36.939
Let's get Bob.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.440
- ( grunting )
- Bob: More, more.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.734
Come on, time to go.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.324
Let's go, now!
Come on! Go!

29:50.498 --> 29:52.580
- Let's get out of here!
- Ah!

29:53.584 --> 29:55.324
(shouting )

29:57.338 --> 30:00.375
(screaming )

30:00.549 --> 30:02.926
- Zack!
- ( screaming )

30:06.389 --> 30:07.378
Go, go!

30:08.891 --> 30:10.973
Come on!

30:16.399 --> 30:18.390
It's just ahead.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.359
Eddie.

30:22.530 --> 30:26.443
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.118
This is Rick.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.537
He's gonna help us.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.452
Everything's gonna
be okay.

30:35.626 --> 30:38.834
Everything--
( breathing heavily )

30:42.675 --> 30:44.540
-( blade scrapes )
- ( shouting )

30:45.928 --> 30:47.759
Damn it!

30:47.930 --> 30:50.012
(sobbing )

30:52.935 --> 30:54.971
I wanted to take
the boar.

30:55.146 --> 30:58.809
ljust knew-- I knew I'd get you here
so much quicker.

31:00.985 --> 31:03.101
He's starving.

31:03.279 --> 31:06.442
He's slowing.
He needs something alive.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.450
Please, I told you,
I can't be without him.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.288
And so I kept him.

31:20.463 --> 31:22.624
It was wrong.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.585
( breathing heavily )

31:25.760 --> 31:28.297
I can't do things like this.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.885
And-- and you have to do
things like this.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.141
Let me be like him.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.677
Don't stop it.

31:37.855 --> 31:39.811
Don't end it after.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.473
- No.
- Let me be with him.

31:43.986 --> 31:44.975
No!

31:45.154 --> 31:47.645
( groans )

31:47.823 --> 31:50.155
(gasping )

31:53.621 --> 31:55.953
( groans )

32:08.594 --> 32:10.380
Hey.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.729
What were...

32:22.900 --> 32:25.061
the questions?

32:27.029 --> 32:29.611
The three questions?

32:31.534 --> 32:34.025
How many walkers
have you killed?

32:40.751 --> 32:42.082
Eddie--

32:42.253 --> 32:44.460
Eddie killed--
killed them all.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.331
Until...
(gasping)

32:52.763 --> 32:54.970
How many people
have you killed?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.848
Just me.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.853
Just me.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.816
Why?

33:12.241 --> 33:15.278
(gasping )

33:19.957 --> 33:21.447
You don't--

33:21.625 --> 33:24.162
you don't get
to come back.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.879
You don't get
to come back

33:29.049 --> 33:31.631
from things.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.713
You don't...

33:33.888 --> 33:35.879
(gasping )

34:03.167 --> 34:05.829
(growling)

34:16.680 --> 34:19.592
"The children fastened their eyes
upon their bit of candle

34:19.767 --> 34:23.635
and watched it melt
slowly and pitilessly away.

34:23.812 --> 34:27.521
Saw the half inch of wick
stand alone at last.

34:27.691 --> 34:30.228
Saw the feeble flame
rise and fall.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.815
Climb the thin tower
of smoke.

34:33.989 --> 34:37.573
Linger at its top
a moment and then..."

34:43.999 --> 34:45.455
Ma'am, should ltake watch now?

34:45.626 --> 34:47.617
Yes, Luke, you do that.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.161
Today...

34:50.339 --> 34:53.297
we are talking about knives--
how to use them,

34:53.467 --> 34:55.879
how to be safe with them,
and how they could save your life.

34:56.053 --> 34:57.338
Patrick: Ma'am,
may I be dismissed?

34:57.513 --> 35:00.630
- What is it?
- I'm not feeling very well.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.844
Sometimes you're gonna
have to fight through it.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.100
What if you wind up
out there alone?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.978
You just give up
because you're feeling bad?

35:08.148 --> 35:12.812
No, it'sjust I don't want
to yack on somebody.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.521
Go.

35:20.661 --> 35:23.152
Okay, today we're gonna
learn how to hold a knife,

35:23.330 --> 35:28.120
how to stab and slash
and where to aim for.

35:33.090 --> 35:36.332
Please, don't tell your father.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.305
(growling)

35:51.525 --> 35:53.686
(growling)

36:41.116 --> 36:43.198
What?

36:44.620 --> 36:46.656
I don't like going out there, either.

36:55.798 --> 36:58.289
( sighs )
Daryl's telling Beth.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.628
There's nothing else to do.

37:02.012 --> 37:03.923
I'll go see her.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.304
I'm not pregnant.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.685
- You know?
- I know.

37:13.065 --> 37:16.102
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.154
I didn't want to,
but we could have.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.490
We can have lives here.

37:25.661 --> 37:29.745
How can you say that
after today?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.451
After Lori?

37:31.625 --> 37:34.617
Because I don't want to be
afraid of being alive.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.461
Being afraid
is what's kept us alive.

37:41.635 --> 37:44.047
No.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.212
It's how we kept breathing.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.020
Hey.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.181
Hi.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.518
What is it?

38:01.697 --> 38:03.437
(sighs)

38:03.615 --> 38:05.526
Zack.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.200
Is he dead?

38:20.591 --> 38:22.547
Okay.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.280
What?

38:50.037 --> 38:52.244
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.373
I'm just glad I got
to know him, you know?

38:57.544 --> 38:59.535
Me, too.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.835
Are you okay?

39:05.511 --> 39:08.548
Just tired of losing people is all.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.595
I'm glad I didn't say good-bye.

39:17.773 --> 39:20.515
I hate good-byes.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.439
Me, too.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.546
You tried to help her.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.423
You couldn't.
No one could.

39:47.594 --> 39:50.336
Some people are too far gone.

39:50.514 --> 39:52.345
You're not.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.131
You tried to help her.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.265
How that woman wound up,

39:56.436 --> 39:58.563
I got close to that.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.812
lfl lost Carl and Judith,
if! lost this place--

40:03.986 --> 40:06.819
Not then, Rick.
Not even then.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.156
You came back.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.362
Your boy came back.

40:14.705 --> 40:17.162
You get to come back.
You do.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.502
(sighs)

40:28.677 --> 40:30.668
(coughing)

40:34.891 --> 40:36.756
(coughing)

40:36.935 --> 40:39.267
( breathing heavily )

40:45.193 --> 40:48.936
(coughing)

41:10.302 --> 41:12.714
(coughing)

41:25.400 --> 41:27.777
( panting )

42:13.490 --> 42:15.446
( wheezing )

42:22.833 --> 42:25.415
(theme music playing )
