01:54.614 --> 01:55.490
Now...

01:56.157 --> 01:59.661
your aunties tell me you have questions,
about your baptism and such.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.829
I do...

02:02.372 --> 02:03.790
but I'm not sure where to begin.

02:03.873 --> 02:04.874
Allow me.

02:07.544 --> 02:11.756
A witch's dark baptism
is our most sacred unholy sacrament.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.299
The oldest of our rites.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.718
We've been performing them for centuries.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.556
Our Dark Lord's book,
the Book of the Beast,

02:19.639 --> 02:21.474
is the most ancient tome in existence.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.725
About that.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.854
If I sign my name
in the Book of the Beast,

02:26.604 --> 02:30.024
does that mean I'm giving
the Dark Lord dominion over my soul?

02:30.108 --> 02:35.363
That's one interpretation,
but it's largely a symbolic gesture,

02:35.697 --> 02:37.740
as rituals in most religions are.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.326
-What else?
-Let's say

02:40.410 --> 02:44.205
I do sign my name in his book.
Doesn't that mean he can call on me?

02:44.539 --> 02:45.498
To do his bidding?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.792
All religions demand some sacrifice.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.004
But signing your name is more like...

02:51.963 --> 02:53.548
a pledge, let's say.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.842
That you'll abide by his commandments.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.595
Do you know your Thirteen Commandments?

02:58.678 --> 03:01.181
-We've taught them to her.
-She's learned them by heart.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.142
I'm not an evil person, Father.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.733
I am glad to hear it. Neither am I.
Neither are your aunts.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.775
But the Devil...

03:14.527 --> 03:16.321
The Dark Lord, yes?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.823
...he is the embodiment of evil.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.824
Incorrect.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.578
He is the embodiment of free will.
Good. Evil.

03:23.661 --> 03:28.458
Those words matter to the False God,
but the Dark Lord is beyond such precepts.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.961
What about Hell?
I don't want to go there when I die.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.547
First of all,
if you accept the Dark Lord's gifts,

03:34.631 --> 03:36.674
you won't die, not for a very long time.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.636
Second of all, Hell is for mortals.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.888
In exchange for their service
and devotion,

03:41.971 --> 03:45.642
witches are exempt
from the eternal flames of damnation.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.020
Really, what's needed here
is a fundamental shift in thinking.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.147
Okay, well, what about my boyfriend?

03:52.440 --> 03:56.653
Why do I have to break up with him

03:58.238 --> 04:02.367
There is an inherent incompatibility.
Should you become a full witch,

04:02.450 --> 04:05.245
your human partner would age
much faster than you.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
My father married a mortal.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.415
True, but he was High Priest
of the Church of Night

04:09.791 --> 04:11.501
and was granted a special dispensation.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.961
-By whom?
-The Dark Lord.

04:13.044 --> 04:17.548
Satan himself blessed the union
of your warlock father and mortal mother,

04:17.632 --> 04:20.885
but even then, even then,
it was not without controversy.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.763
Some girls at the Academy of Unseen Arts
have suggested

04:23.846 --> 04:26.224
that my parents' deaths
weren't accidental,

04:26.766 --> 04:29.519
that maybe they'd been... murdered.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.647
An inquiry was held.
No malfeasance was detected.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.567
It was a terrible accident
that befell your mother and father,

04:36.985 --> 04:38.152
but it was just that...

04:39.654 --> 04:40.571
an accident.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.034
Earlier today,
I took a bite of a malum malus.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.160
You did what?

04:47.495 --> 04:49.580
And the future it showed me was...

04:50.748 --> 04:51.916
horrible.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.378
The biting of a malum malus
for prognostication of the future

04:55.461 --> 04:58.339
hasn't been recommended for decades.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.718
Specifically because of
its wild inaccuracy.

05:04.137 --> 05:04.971
But if I may...

05:07.598 --> 05:10.310
your father was one of
the Church of Night's greatest thinkers.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.812
He wanted you to follow in his footsteps.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.482
It's right that you have
so many questions.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.359
My advice?

05:18.818 --> 05:19.902
Take your baptism.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.613
Come to the Academy of Unseen Arts.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.240
Learn our history.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.243
Find answers to your questions.
Challenge them.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.078
Make better answers.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.497
Make us stronger.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.751
Will you try, at least?

05:35.585 --> 05:39.380
-And should it not be to your liking--
-You'll let me leave the Church?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.506
Free choice, child.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.092
That is the bedrock
on which our Church is built.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.808
But I do hope I'll see you
in the woods on Samhain.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.770
The moon is certain to be glorious.

05:54.395 --> 05:58.983
She'll be there, Your Excellency.
With bells on, won't you, Sabrina?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.613
Looking forward to it.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.994
In that case...

06:10.745 --> 06:12.080
if there's nothing else...

06:12.205 --> 06:14.165
There is one thing, Your Excellency.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.633
A witch's mark, without question.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.720
What about the boy's parents?

06:27.804 --> 06:28.679
Oh, mortal.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.807
They adopted him, Father,
they didn't know.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.016
Poor boy.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.810
Alone in the world.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.853
Raised by mortals.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
Never baptized.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.904
Think of what he might've accomplished.
Tragic, really.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.826
His murder hasn't been solved.
I've been checking the papers, the news.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.495
So, we've started to wonder

06:52.578 --> 06:54.872
if there might not be a witch-hunter
in our midst.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.541
-Highly unlikely.
-But possible.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.630
I'll speak to the Council...

07:03.631 --> 07:06.717
but I shouldn't think this is any more
than what it appears to be.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.732
He's a bit dramatic, isn't he

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
He was your father's mentor, you know.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.029
But, then, Dad surpassed him.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.906
Yeah.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.664
Your father was
incredibly charismatic, Sabrina.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.709
People wanted to follow Edward,
wherever he went.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.627
He was so handsome.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.090
He could've been a movie star
if he'd chosen, like Cousin Montgomery.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.594
But no, he received the call early.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.346
When he was six years old, you know.

07:56.184 --> 08:01.564
Aunt Hilda, did you ever have any doubts
about your dark baptism?

08:03.941 --> 08:08.154
When I was your age,
I signed my name in the Book of the Beast.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.449
I mean...

08:11.532 --> 08:14.160
...us girls didn't have any options
back then.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.246
It's just simply what was done.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.624
Do I have regrets?

08:21.709 --> 08:24.378
You mustn't tell your Aunt Zelda this,

08:24.462 --> 08:26.172
but...

08:26.255 --> 08:28.049
...some days, some nights...

08:29.008 --> 08:31.928
I dream that I am walking
into the Greendale woods,

08:32.011 --> 08:33.971
in the peak of dry season...

08:34.847 --> 08:36.599
with a lit torch in each hand...

08:37.975 --> 08:42.146
so that I'd watch the whole forest burn,
like so much kindling.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.611
Have a lovely little sleep, my darling.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.238
Tuckity-tuck-tuck-tuck.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.074
Oh, there we go. This little piggy...

08:53.366 --> 08:54.784
We're a little bit old.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.585
Hilda, you fool,
you'll be the death of me.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.797
And I'll be the death of you.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.936
There you are.
Look who just stopped by for a visit!

09:29.026 --> 09:30.111
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.323
You drew all of these?
They're wicked good, mate.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.743
Thanks. Yeah, I'm pretty into comics
and graphic novels.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.830
Me too. Alan Moore,
Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.623
You came by to talk comics?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.167
Uh, no, I wanted to surprise you.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.045
-And isn't it the loveliest surprise.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.298
Um, also to ask your aunts...

09:51.007 --> 09:53.050
I, uh... know you can't do anything

09:53.134 --> 09:55.136
on your actual birthday
because you have plans.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.263
She does. Set in stone.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.933
So I came by to see
if we could celebrate the next day.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.518
Uh, Saturday.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.145
Go bowling, maybe.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.355
You and me and Susie and Roz.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.150
Your aunts can come, if they want.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.901
The day after my birthday.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.447
Would that even be possible?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.616
I think it's a marvelous idea.

10:16.699 --> 10:21.120
I do too,
but why don't we play it by ear, hmm?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.458
What was that all about?

10:25.958 --> 10:30.630
Me stopping by? It's partly
'cause I don't really know your aunts.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.215
That's entirely intentional, you realize.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.469
I don't know,
maybe bowling wasn't the right idea.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.221
No, it was perfect.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.599
Well, hey, if not this Saturday, the next.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.060
And every Saturday after that.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.604
We have all the time in the world.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.071
What's this? I'm thinking we need
to redecorate a little bit.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.072
What do you think?

10:56.155 --> 11:00.951
"Women's Intersectional
Creative Cultural Association," huh?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.747
Oh, man, well, look at this.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.083
Oh!

11:09.919 --> 11:12.171
Can they even call themselves women?

11:13.464 --> 11:15.257
Hey, dicks-for-brains.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.097
What's your problem, dyke?

11:29.105 --> 11:32.483
Guys, guys, guys, guys! Let's go!

11:35.986 --> 11:38.322
You can't let them get to you
like that, Susie.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.366
-What am I supposed--
-What happened now?

11:40.449 --> 11:41.867
I got suspended.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.370
I'm supposed to take Susie home
and then come right back.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.331
Except I can't go home,
I don't want my dad to know about this.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.583
He won't, then. We'll go somewhere else.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.378
Suspended for what?
It's not even first period.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.379
I got into a fight.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.549
With a bunch of asswipes
who were ripping our WICCA posters down.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.135
Those football players

11:59.218 --> 12:01.804
Wait. You got into a fight
with football players

12:01.887 --> 12:04.724
-Four of them.
-That's it, we're going to the police.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.643
We are pressing charges.
Susie, this is physical assault.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.311
Yeah, but I started the fight.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.441
Susie, I swear to you,
this will never happen again,

12:13.524 --> 12:15.484
but you have to tell me this time.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.653
What are their names?

12:20.614 --> 12:24.076
Billy Marlin, Ed Dursley,
Seth Grinwis, and Carl Tapper.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.246
Four of Greendale's favorite sons.
Golden boys.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.166
Before, they were bullying Susie,
now they're punching her?

12:30.249 --> 12:33.127
She's tiny.
They have to be held accountable.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.671
We'll go sit down together
with Principal Hawthorne

12:35.755 --> 12:37.006
next week when he's back.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.591
I may not be here next week.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.508
Oh?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.927
Have you decided you're leaving us?

12:42.011 --> 12:47.016
It's looking that way,
but not if I can't get this sorted out.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.934
I can't leave my friends in trouble.

12:49.185 --> 12:53.314
Well, the only way boys like these
learn new behavior is to--

12:53.397 --> 12:54.565
Fight fire with--

12:54.648 --> 12:55.733
Hellfire.

13:00.696 --> 13:05.534
Well, as an educator,
I'm not allowed to say such things.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.662
But sometimes a little hell raising

13:08.746 --> 13:11.791
is precisely what's needed
to move the needle.

13:13.042 --> 13:18.464
Mind you, I wouldn't take them on alone.
Four against one? No, I'd even the odds.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.717
And enlist the baddest bitches you know
to help.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.763
I can think of three girls.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.183
And then, once your house
is in order here,

13:29.266 --> 13:35.648
you're free to transfer to this new school
with a... light heart.

13:39.777 --> 13:44.657
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
travelers of the sea and land.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.034
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.745
and thrice again, to make up nine.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.998
Peace! The charm's wound up.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.967
Hello, half-breed.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.719
And how are we feeling today?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.348
Do you mean because of your curse?

14:09.765 --> 14:13.102
Isn't that why you summoned us

14:13.185 --> 14:15.813
We'll happily do so, as soon as you pledge

14:15.896 --> 14:17.982
that you won't be going to the Academy.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.612
My Aunt Hilda's taken care of your curse
with a reversing spell...

14:24.572 --> 14:27.449
but we still might be able
to strike a deal.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.290
There are four mortal boys
who need to be taught a lesson.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.002
Help me teach them,

14:38.669 --> 14:41.755
and I'll stay right where I am
at Baxter High.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.138
-Are they handsome, at least?

14:49.221 --> 14:51.265
It's always more fun
when they're handsome.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.851
We'll back you up, half-breed.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.687
But they're your enemies.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.023
You'll have to do most of the work.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.452
Sister?

15:11.535 --> 15:13.829
Ooh! Zelda!

15:13.996 --> 15:17.875
My turnips, they're coming up
marvelously this year.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.037
I hope I've done your son justice,
Mr. and Mrs. Kemper.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.169
Oh! He's beautiful.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.714
He looks beautiful.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.801
I'm so happy you're pleased.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.014
Would you like some tea, Mrs. Kemper?

16:16.600 --> 16:20.062
Forgive me for asking,
but I was wondering...

16:20.688 --> 16:22.815
is there any news
on what happened to Connor?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.527
-The police don't know anything.
-Hmm.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.155
They don't know why he was in the park
at that hour. We don't know why.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.908
He went out for a walk, that's all.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.077
And tell me, Mr. and Mrs. Kemper,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.997
should we be expecting a crowd
for Connor's visitation?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.959
Connor didn't have a...
wide circle of friends.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.794
He kept to himself?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.339
Mmm, he was quiet.
He loved reading.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.010
Well, and talking to his lizard.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.888
How do you mean?

16:54.972 --> 16:56.849
He kept an iguana in his room
under a heat lamp.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.977
He would feed it and talk to it.

17:00.352 --> 17:04.940
Sometimes, I swear, it looked like Connor
was actually waiting for it to answer.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.734
Hmm.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.701
What were the Kempers doing here?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.370
I invited them to inspect my handiwork
on their son.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.874
Ambrose, you're not meddling
in mortal affairs again, are you?

17:22.249 --> 17:23.751
Connor wasn't a mortal.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.754
In fact, I believe he even had a familiar.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.422
An iguana.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.507
Where's Aunt Hilda?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.637
She annoyed me, so I killed her
and buried her in the yard.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.563
What about Meg?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.441
-'Cause I would, in a heartbeat.
-Meg Simms?

17:48.025 --> 17:51.862
-No, dude. She's a prude, I hear.
-Yeah, not to mention a dog.

17:52.154 --> 17:56.742
I mean, her face is rather dog-like,
but her body, I mean...

17:56.825 --> 17:59.161
Okay, let me ask you a question, then.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.704
Could I put a bag over her head?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.831
You could, but why go through
all that trouble

18:02.915 --> 18:04.958
when you could just do her doggie-style?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.711
-Good call.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.047
Hey, what's your problem, queer?

18:10.130 --> 18:12.132
I gotta take a piss.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.558
What the hell?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.775
Guys. Guys.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.084
Hello, boys.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.254
What's up?

18:50.921 --> 18:54.341
The four of us were thinking of having
a little party in the mines...

18:56.593 --> 18:58.554
but we'd need beer and boys for that.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.058
Do you go to Baxter?

19:03.767 --> 19:05.227
You look kind of familiar.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.230
I do, but my gal pals go somewhere else.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.608
Where -You wouldn't know it.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.903
It's a special school.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.864
Very special.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.866
No boys allowed.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.623
You know what they call this place,
don't you?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.293
The Devil's Doorway.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.504
They say the mines in Greendale
run so deep,

19:33.046 --> 19:36.550
one shaft takes you
all the way down to Hell.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.054
I don't know about this, man. This is
starting to feel really freaky to me.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.181
Now, boys.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.516
Don't go getting scared on us.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.812
I just don't wanna break my neck
tripping in the dark.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.149
‐There are lamps right inside the tunnel.
‐See?

19:54.735 --> 19:56.445
Maybe they are scared.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.324
Maybe they're just scared little boys.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.634
We're almost there.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.553
Where?

20:22.471 --> 20:23.847
The Devil's Lair.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.891
She's kidding, right?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.105
You know what we forgot?

20:33.106 --> 20:34.024
Music.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.277
We can't have a party without music.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.863
Wait, I hear something.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.701
Listen.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.912
This is so messed up.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.791
-I love this song.
-Me too.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.751
-Me three.
-Me four.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.963
That's impossible.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.715
Where the hell is that coming from?

20:59.007 --> 21:03.887
-It's so... warm down here.

21:03.971 --> 21:08.058
-Probably because we're so close to him.
-Who?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.143
You know who.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.728
Guys, we should go.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.481
-Shut the hell up, Ed.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.476
What do we think?

21:52.811 --> 21:53.854
Too bright?

22:07.576 --> 22:10.245
There, that's better.

22:11.038 --> 22:11.997
Much better.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.582
So much better.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.580
-Just look at them.
-They're so adorable.

22:53.663 --> 22:56.541
-We should take a picture.
-I brought a camera.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.966
What the hell

23:08.512 --> 23:10.472
You bitches are gonna regret that.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.933
No... we won't.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.228
Because these photos will be up
all over school

23:16.311 --> 23:18.480
if you lay a hand on Susie

23:18.563 --> 23:21.441
or any girl ever again.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.359
Let's get outta here.

23:22.442 --> 23:26.154
No one is going anywhere
until you give us those pictures.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.323
No, no, no.

23:29.199 --> 23:33.662
No one's going anywhere
because we're not done playing yet.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.788
Prudence.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.501
-You'll like this next game.
-This isn't what we talked about.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.421
-It's called Devil...
-We got what we needed.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.964
-Let's let them go.
-...in the...

23:44.047 --> 23:46.007
-We can't kill them.
-Huh?

23:46.591 --> 23:48.552
-...Dark.
-What the hell?

23:48.635 --> 23:51.179
-What are they doing?
-Everyone stay calm.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.933
-If we can't see them, they can't see us.
-There's where you're wrong.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.269
-Girls?
-Guys, I can't see either.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.481
Guys! Did you feel that?
Something touched me.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.452
It touched me!

24:25.380 --> 24:26.256
What's this?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.387
Souvenirs from tonight.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.514
I don't understand.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.849
We took their boyhoods.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.809
Until you release the birds,

24:37.893 --> 24:42.063
those four boys won't be...
rising to any occasion.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.567
A few weeks of impotence
might teach them better manners.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.283
You could've warned me.
At least given me a heads-up.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.660
We didn't think
you'd want to participate.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.787
But perhaps you're more suited
to the Academy

24:57.871 --> 24:59.414
than we originally imagined.

24:59.956 --> 25:00.832
Yeah.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.501
About that--

25:02.584 --> 25:05.462
Oh, save your breath, we know you lied.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.297
You're a terrible liar.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.218
If you knew I lied,
then why would you help me?

25:11.301 --> 25:13.929
We don't need a reason
to torment mortal boys.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.139
But if you are transferring
to the Academy,

25:16.223 --> 25:17.891
why bother with the boys at all?

25:17.974 --> 25:19.851
They'll soon be out of your life.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.438
I don't want them harassing my friends
when I'm gone.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.191
If you care about them so much,
why leave them?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.151
If you have a choice?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.362
I'm not sure I do.

25:30.820 --> 25:34.950
I'm getting a lot of pressure to transfer.
Father Blackwood came to my house.

25:35.033 --> 25:35.992
What?

25:38.411 --> 25:40.163
The High Priest visited you?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.417
To relieve me of my doubts.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.753
And he did, some of them, but...

25:48.088 --> 25:49.714
it still feels wrong to me.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.551
Signing my name in the Book of the Beast.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.928
Knowing that, on some level, I...

25:56.221 --> 25:57.472
I'm giving up my freedom.

25:57.889 --> 25:58.807
You are.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.976
In exchange for power.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.144
An even exchange.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.815
But I want both. I want freedom and power.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.486
He'll never give you that.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.281
The Dark Lord.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.160
The thought of you, of any of us,
having both terrifies him.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.829
Why is that?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.039
He's a man, isn't he?

26:33.425 --> 26:36.636
Nice outfit.
But Halloween's not until tomorrow night.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.474
Roz is still having a party, by the way.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.061
Her parents are out of town
at some retreat with their church.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.480
So it should go pretty late,
if you wanna stop by after--

26:47.564 --> 26:48.732
Harvey.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.611
You like comic books. No, you love them.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.696
And-- And superheroes.

26:54.779 --> 27:00.410
So, let's say you're a kid,
a normal kid, with a normal life.

27:00.493 --> 27:03.496
And one day, you wander into a cave...

27:04.456 --> 27:09.252
and this wizard who lives in the cave says
he'll grant you all these superpowers.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.172
What powers?

27:12.922 --> 27:14.924
Like, can I fly?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.135
Eventually, yes.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.680
But the wizard, he says that
in exchange for these powers,

27:20.764 --> 27:23.183
you have to give up everything else
in your life.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.853
Your school, your friends,
your girlfriend.

27:29.814 --> 27:30.732
What would you do?

27:31.691 --> 27:33.735
Are you my girlfriend in this scenario?

27:34.569 --> 27:35.487
Yes.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.489
Then no.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.241
I wouldn't take them.

27:41.076 --> 27:41.993
Really?

27:43.620 --> 27:44.996
You'd give up flying?

27:45.622 --> 27:47.290
There's no flying in my life...

27:48.750 --> 27:50.502
without you, Sabrina Spellman.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.024
Zelda.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.445
Took you long enough.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.913
Each slaying,
it takes you longer to resurrect.

28:27.622 --> 28:32.627
Eventually, there will come a time
when I bury you and you'll stay buried.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.964
You can't keep killing me.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.716
I'm your older sister, Hilda,

28:37.799 --> 28:41.219
it's my Satan-given right to kill you
as many times as I please.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.930
Especially when
you're behaving so stupidly.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.559
Encouraging Sabrina to do anything
other than join the Church of the Night.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.729
Edward entrusted her to our care.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.275
If Sabrina does not sign her name
in the Book of the Beast, we will have...

28:56.443 --> 28:58.528
failed him and the Dark Lord.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.947
So fair warning, sister.

29:01.322 --> 29:04.033
Any silly doubts or regrets you feel...

29:05.118 --> 29:06.745
keep them to yourself.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.207
The simple truth is
Sabrina has no choice in this matter.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.002
To pretend otherwise is reckless.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.672
Have I made myself clear?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.468
Yes, sister.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.778
Aunt Hilda.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.322
Ooh! Morning.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.240
That's gorgeous.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.701
It's your mom's wedding dress.

29:47.243 --> 29:50.371
They lived such a fairy tale, those two.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.042
I thought you might wear it tonight,
to your baptism.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.048
Aren't witches only allowed to wear black
to their baptism?

30:00.590 --> 30:03.635
Oh, that hasn't been the rule for years.
Decades.

30:09.265 --> 30:13.770
You know, you have nothing
to be afraid of, my darling.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.775
I mean, your Aunt Zelda and I
are gonna be there.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.401
We...

30:20.902 --> 30:23.238
And we'll make sure
nothing bad happens to you.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.616
And then, you know, you'll see.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.911
Tomorrow... you're gonna wake up,

30:29.994 --> 30:32.664
and, well, you'll wonder
what all the fuss was about

30:32.747 --> 30:34.415
in the first place.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.628
Do you believe me?

30:39.379 --> 30:41.464
My sweet, brave girl?

30:43.842 --> 30:44.926
I love you.

30:53.184 --> 30:57.397
Hilda and I have errands to run
and preparations to finish...

30:57.480 --> 30:59.315
...but I've already called Baxter High

30:59.399 --> 31:02.443
and told them you're having
a terrible outbreak of hives.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.570
Wh-- What?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.614
Why would you do that, Aunt Zelda?

31:06.698 --> 31:10.577
The day before your dark baptism
should be spent in quiet contemplation,

31:10.660 --> 31:12.161
reading your satanic verses.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.163
But I haven't said goodbye
to my friends yet.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.499
I can't just vanish from their lives.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.252
At a minimum,
I have to tell them that I'm--

31:19.335 --> 31:22.130
Transferring to some posh private school
in Connecticut?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.756
You'll send them a postcard.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.802
Ambrose will keep you company
and keep an eye on you.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.554
Won't you, Ambrose?

31:32.807 --> 31:34.017
But of course, Auntie Zee.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.571
So sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Meeks,

31:46.654 --> 31:52.243
but Sabrina Spellman
wasn't in homeroom this morning and I--

31:53.119 --> 31:54.913
I wondered if you'd heard from her.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.039
I did.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.043
Well, from her aunt.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.128
-Ah.
-Hilda?

32:02.420 --> 32:03.379
Zelda?

32:04.631 --> 32:07.592
One of them called to say
that Sabrina's feeling under the weather

32:07.675 --> 32:10.553
-and will be staying home today.
-Oh! Oh!

32:11.054 --> 32:13.848
And on her birthday. Oh, dear.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.143
Well, it can't be helped, I suppose.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.276
Have a good day, Mrs. Meeks.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.612
Happy Halloween.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.659
I'll still be able to see them,
won't I, Ambrose?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.285
Roz and Harvey and Susie?

32:34.369 --> 32:36.496
I mean, just because
we're not at the same school,

32:36.579 --> 32:38.456
it doesn't mean we can't be friends.

32:38.539 --> 32:42.126
I'll be at the Academy of The Unseen Arts
during the week, but during the weekends--

32:42.210 --> 32:43.920
On the weekends,
you will still be a witch.

32:44.003 --> 32:47.632
No, I know, but we'll still be able
to go to the movies, same as always,

32:47.715 --> 32:50.134
and bowling,
and all the fun things we do together.

32:50.218 --> 32:54.222
Of course, Auntie Mame and Baby Jane
would leave me to explain the hard bits.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.474
Look, it is frowned upon.
It is discouraged.

32:56.557 --> 33:00.186
But you talk to mortals.
And Hilda and Zelda, they talk to mortals.

33:00.269 --> 33:03.606
Yeah, we do, in passing, but we do not
have meaningful connections with them.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.025
The coven forbids that,
they will see to it.

33:06.109 --> 33:09.696
What

33:12.407 --> 33:14.283
Ambrose, will they?

33:16.869 --> 33:21.207
It's as though a veil drops...
between you and the mortal world,

33:21.541 --> 33:24.585
and eventually, quite quickly, you're...

33:25.545 --> 33:26.379
weaned from it.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.464
-I won't forget them.
-You'll want to...

33:31.175 --> 33:34.512
-or else the pain is too much to bear.
-Why would it be painful?

33:34.804 --> 33:39.892
Time slows down,
and they'll grow old and you won't.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.021
And those things that are
so terribly important to them

33:43.104 --> 33:46.607
will... seem trivial and pale to you.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.527
The longer you're a witch,
the more you'll understand, but...

33:52.030 --> 33:53.906
it's better to forget the mortal world...

33:56.325 --> 33:58.786
and think only of what is ahead...

34:01.456 --> 34:03.541
and be ready for what is ahead.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.800
-Cousin, where are you going?
-To call Harvey.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.219
I'm having one last night with my friends.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.230
Well, there we are. As I promised.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.982
Black narcissus.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.236
Marvelous.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.752
How clever. You're dressed as your future.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.130
Sabrina!

34:52.590 --> 34:55.802
It was kind of last minute,
borrowed it from my brother.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.595
I'm teasing, you look great.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.555
You can come to the party with us,
if you want.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.350
Thanks, but if I'm risking banishment
to the Nether Realm,

35:02.433 --> 35:05.978
it's going to be for something other
than a high school masquerade.

35:07.688 --> 35:10.316
-Nether Realm?
-He's kidding, Harvey.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.000
I didn't have a costume, but is this okay?

35:29.085 --> 35:31.754
You're... beautiful.

35:38.886 --> 35:39.929
Happy Halloween.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.848
And Birthday. And...

35:43.015 --> 35:43.850
everything.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.816
Well, if you're leaving, leave now,

35:51.899 --> 35:54.485
before Hilda and Zelda come home
and eat you.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.989
I'll explain that you'll meet them
at the appointed hour and place.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.324
Cousin, if you are late,
the blue flames will burn you.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.201
I won't be.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.287
And thank you, Ambrose.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.416
-Blue flames?
-It's just, uh, another joke.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.877
Not joking.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.226
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.689
Sabrina, you came!

36:31.772 --> 36:35.234
-I did.
-Oh, yay! Oh, my God!

36:35.318 --> 36:36.736
Happy birthday!

36:37.195 --> 36:41.115
Wow! You look beautiful.
Is that a wedding dress?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.074
Yes.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.244
-But it's not mine.
-Good.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.455
You've been acting so cagey
about your birthday,

36:47.538 --> 36:49.916
I thought you and Harvey
might do something crazy like elope.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.293
Never.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.546
I'd never do anything like that
without telling my best friend.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.840
Thank you. I'm relieved to hear that.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.843
Well, come in. Come in.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.428
Hi!

37:02.637 --> 37:05.681
Oh, uh, drinks are in the kitchen,
and I think Susie's back there.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.603
I had to sneak out, but that's one
good thing about living on a farm.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.188
My dad goes to sleep at eight o'clock.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.314
And you're okay?

37:13.397 --> 37:16.317
You're feeling okay after what happened
with those football creeps?

37:16.400 --> 37:21.239
Honestly, Sabrina? I don't know why,
but I am raring for a rematch.

37:21.322 --> 37:24.242
I have a feeling that won't be necessary,
Susie.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.745
You guys, come on,
help me get the dancing started.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.960
You guys.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.170
No crying! Make a wish!

38:36.314 --> 38:37.231
Hey.

38:37.732 --> 38:38.941
What'd you wish for?

38:44.488 --> 38:45.698
More of this.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.203
Don't forget me, Harvey.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.374
And don't hate me.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.212
No matter what.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.173
Promise?

39:04.759 --> 39:07.345
Sabrina, why would I ever hate you?

39:09.638 --> 39:11.140
Guys! Guys!

39:11.515 --> 39:14.435
Everyone, it's happening.
Come on, in the backyard. Hurry.

39:36.957 --> 39:38.209
Harvey, what time is it?

39:38.292 --> 39:40.503
-Almost midnight.
-Oh, my gosh. I gotta go.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.381
What? Oh, that thing with your aunts.
Let me take you.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.424
No. No. You can't.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.177
But...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.180
I love you, Harvey.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.144
I'll always love you.

42:00.476 --> 42:03.437
Welcome, Daughter of Night.

42:06.065 --> 42:08.901
Who presents this child
for unholy baptism?

42:09.318 --> 42:11.028
We do, Your Excellency.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.948
Late for your own baptism. Honestly.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.366
You look lovely, darling.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.825
Disrobe her, sisters.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.175
We are gathered here together,
in these woods,

42:33.259 --> 42:35.052
in the presence of our Dark Lord,

42:35.970 --> 42:36.971
with all the souls,

42:40.516 --> 42:42.685
The Most Unholy Church of Night.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.770
Kneel, child.

42:57.449 --> 42:59.493
Our Dark Lord teaches us.

43:01.579 --> 43:05.249
There is no law beyond.
Do what thou wilt.

43:11.797 --> 43:15.092
Would you like to be happy, child,
to be free?

43:16.093 --> 43:18.637
Free to love and to hate?

43:19.346 --> 43:24.518
To be what nature meant you to be,
true to her laws and yourself only?

43:28.480 --> 43:29.398
Sabrina.

43:31.859 --> 43:32.735
Yes, Father.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.863
Do you believe in Lucifer, the archangel,

43:35.946 --> 43:38.991
who preferred the loss of Heaven
to that of his pride?

43:40.367 --> 43:41.452
Yes, Father.

43:41.535 --> 43:42.953
In exchange for this belief,

43:43.037 --> 43:47.291
you shall be granted powers
that will enable you to be of service...

43:47.958 --> 43:49.168
to the Dark Lord.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.463
Sabrina Edwina Diana Spellman...

43:55.132 --> 43:57.301
are you willing to forsake
the Path of Light

43:57.384 --> 44:00.304
and follow the Path of Night
wherever it may lead you?

44:00.387 --> 44:01.221
I am.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.558
And are you willing to place our Dark Lord
above all others in your life,

44:04.642 --> 44:08.020
be it your loved ones, your family,
your friends, your neighbors?

44:08.937 --> 44:09.772
I...

44:15.277 --> 44:16.153
am.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.449
Then it is time to sign his book.

45:06.453 --> 45:08.539
In signing his book,
the Book of the Beast,

45:08.622 --> 45:10.040
you swear to obey without question

45:10.124 --> 45:13.043
any order you may receive
from the Dark Lord,

45:13.127 --> 45:16.213
or from any figure
he has placed in authority over you.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.924
That's not what you said before.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.009
In signing his book,
the Book of the Beast,

45:21.093 --> 45:24.388
you swear to give your mind, body,
and soul unreservedly

45:24.471 --> 45:27.182
to the furtherance of the designs
of our Lord Satan.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.017
You said I would have free will.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.461
I can't do this.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.338
You must.

45:59.757 --> 46:00.799
Sabrina.

46:01.759 --> 46:02.760
Don’t you dare.

46:02.843 --> 46:03.761
Darling?

46:06.638 --> 46:07.848
-Run.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.893
Run. Run!

46:13.562 --> 46:14.938
I'm sorry, Aunties.

46:22.988 --> 46:23.947
Get her.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.435
Ambrose!

46:55.270 --> 46:56.563
Ambrose!

47:02.653 --> 47:04.488
-Sabrina!
-Ambrose!

47:10.285 --> 47:12.329
Ambrose!

47:13.956 --> 47:17.084
You won't--
You won't believe what happened.

47:17.417 --> 47:19.044
I think I can guess, cousin.

47:20.045 --> 47:20.921
Behind you.

47:25.342 --> 47:27.511
While the blood moon still shines,

47:27.594 --> 47:29.763
you must sign the Book of the Beast.

47:43.318 --> 47:44.403
I will not.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.239
There is another path for me,

47:47.531 --> 47:49.783
just as there was
for my father and mother.

47:50.158 --> 47:51.285
A third way.

47:52.327 --> 47:53.996
And even if there isn't,

47:54.079 --> 48:00.711
my name is Sabrina Spellman,
and I will not sign it away!

48:07.551 --> 48:08.385
Girls.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.851
A circle of protection rings this house!

48:18.145 --> 48:20.522
And no witch save a Spellman may cross it.

48:21.648 --> 48:24.610
Any unwelcome witch that tries shall burn!

48:25.360 --> 48:28.030
So please, go ahead.

48:45.297 --> 48:46.965
When did you put a protection
on the house?

48:47.215 --> 48:48.216
I didn't.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.761
Though I should probably start, hmm?

49:02.272 --> 49:03.690
I failed you.

49:03.857 --> 49:07.653
I failed you, Dark Lord.
I deserve no mercy.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.530
Please show me mercy.

49:10.822 --> 49:11.657
Please.

49:12.574 --> 49:13.867
Please, Dark Lord.

49:34.596 --> 49:36.682
Thank you.

49:37.182 --> 49:39.977
I am not worthy of your love...

49:41.520 --> 49:44.189
but I kiss your beautiful feet.

49:56.576 --> 49:59.705
I will not stumble again, I swear to you.

50:01.748 --> 50:03.291
You shall have her.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.545
You shall have the girl.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.173
Thy...

50:10.924 --> 50:11.758
will...

50:12.592 --> 50:13.427
be...

50:13.802 --> 50:15.178
...done.

50:34.489 --> 50:35.323
Morning.

50:35.991 --> 50:37.617
Oh, blessed morning, child.

50:37.951 --> 50:38.869
Morning, cous.

50:52.049 --> 50:55.052
Please, Aunt Zelda,
are you never going to speak to me again?

50:55.552 --> 50:56.887
You want me to speak?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.351
All right, I'll speak.

51:08.774 --> 51:11.610
You humiliated us
in front of the entire coven.

51:12.235 --> 51:14.154
You dishonored the Spellman family name.

51:14.237 --> 51:16.281
Father Blackwood lied, Aunt Zelda.

51:16.364 --> 51:19.576
He sat in our parlor and told me
that I'd always have a choice,

51:19.659 --> 51:22.120
that our religion is based on free will.

51:22.204 --> 51:25.415
But in the woods,
that was the exact opposite of free will.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.043
Beyond that, your refusal to sign
the Book of the Beast

51:28.126 --> 51:30.378
goes directly against
your father's explicit wishes.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.339
I'm not sure that's true, either.

51:32.422 --> 51:33.340
Sabrina.

51:33.423 --> 51:34.382
I'm sorry, but...

51:36.426 --> 51:38.637
in the woods, during the ceremony,

51:38.720 --> 51:41.556
I saw two figures
who looked like my mom and dad.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.642
Like some sort of spectral vision?

51:43.725 --> 51:45.018
I'm not sure what...

51:46.103 --> 51:48.563
but they definitely didn't want me
to sign the Book of the Beast.

51:50.565 --> 51:51.733
They wanted me to run.

51:57.864 --> 52:00.117
And so the girl
who had to decide

52:00.200 --> 52:02.702
between being a witch and being mortal...

52:03.453 --> 52:04.913
chose neither path.

52:05.413 --> 52:09.376
Or, if you look at it another way,
chose both.

52:10.043 --> 52:12.838
She was half-witch, but with two covens.

52:15.423 --> 52:18.093
You guys, we were just talking...

52:18.468 --> 52:21.429
about how we've been waiting a long time
for a group like this.

52:21.513 --> 52:25.308
And not just at Baxter High,
but in Greendale.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.518
Agreed.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.311
Yeah. Uh...

52:28.728 --> 52:31.898
Welcome, one and all, to WICCA.

52:32.482 --> 52:35.193
Uh... let's pass around the sign-in sheet.

52:39.781 --> 52:41.158
Sorry I'm late, girls.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.868
Ms. Wardwell.

52:43.451 --> 52:46.121
No, you're, uh... you're right on time.

52:46.496 --> 52:49.791
You do know that just because
you're our faculty advisor

52:49.875 --> 52:52.544
doesn't mean you have to attend
every meeting, right?

52:52.627 --> 52:55.172
Oh, but I want to, Sabrina.

52:55.255 --> 52:58.049
-Huh.
-As long as you're at Baxter High, I...

52:58.133 --> 53:01.052
I want us working
extremely closely on this.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.513
Sabrina Spellman,

53:03.597 --> 53:05.849
please report
to Principal Hawthorne's office.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.393
Sabrina Spellman
to the principal's office.

53:08.935 --> 53:11.146
He's baaaack.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.236
Harvey.

53:18.945 --> 53:20.572
-Oh, my gosh.
-Sabrina.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.240
-Hey.

53:22.324 --> 53:23.200
I got your messages.

53:23.283 --> 53:26.369
It was a super-intense weekend
with my aunts.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.080
Don't worry about me,
as long as you're okay.

53:30.165 --> 53:30.999
I am.

53:31.917 --> 53:32.792
I think I am.

53:33.710 --> 53:37.172
I'll explain everything as soon as I can,
but I am gonna need you, Harvey.

53:38.673 --> 53:40.675
I'm here for you, 'Brina.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.093
Always, you know that.

53:42.969 --> 53:43.803
I do.

53:44.763 --> 53:45.680
I so do.

54:02.697 --> 54:05.116
You wanted to see me, sir?

54:05.825 --> 54:07.327
I did, indeed.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.624
This outrageous club of yours.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.725
Principal Hawthorne?

54:38.358 --> 54:39.317
Dark Lord.

54:40.777 --> 54:43.363
I admire your defiance, girl,

54:44.155 --> 54:46.616
but you will sign my book.

54:47.867 --> 54:49.577
You will beg to sign it.

54:51.162 --> 54:53.540
I-- I don't think so.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.626
You think this is a contest?

54:57.377 --> 55:00.255
You think that you can defeat me?

55:00.338 --> 55:02.007
You cannot.

55:02.424 --> 55:03.758
And do you know why?

55:05.468 --> 55:09.347
Because your flesh is mortal,

55:09.889 --> 55:11.099
and in the end,

55:11.599 --> 55:16.646
all mortal flesh must burn.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.506
Brett, move your head.
