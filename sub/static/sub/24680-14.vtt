00:02.293 --> 00:04.810
In New York City's war on crime,

00:04.810 --> 00:08.026
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.026 --> 00:10.008
of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.008 --> 00:12.366
These are their stories.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.373
So, Kenny,

00:16.373 --> 00:19.291
Mommy taking you to
the snake farm today? / Uh-huh.

00:19.291 --> 00:22.290
He's been wanting to go for weeks.

00:27.348 --> 00:29.669
Has Kenny been treated at any other clinics?

00:29.669 --> 00:32.253
Not since we've been in Bangkok.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.534
Why? Is there...

00:35.534 --> 00:37.998
I need to retest something,

00:37.998 --> 00:41.448
and in the meantime,
we will switch his prescription.

00:45.192 --> 00:46.837
Pete, he's overreacting.

00:46.837 --> 00:48.322
These local pharmacies...

00:48.322 --> 00:51.200
Yes. I have it. I'll have it analyzed
in New York.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.227
I'm getting on the plane now.

00:53.911 --> 00:56.700
What about our Thai distributors?

00:57.421 --> 00:58.833
They don't know anything.

00:58.833 --> 01:01.251
If we're going to get a grip on this,
we need Buchanan.

01:01.251 --> 01:03.460
That won't be easy.

01:04.176 --> 01:06.921
ERIC DUNLOW
Assistant to Mr.Buchanan
Perkins School of Business

01:08.595 --> 01:11.102
Just got a lot easier.

01:16.349 --> 01:18.130
Eric Dunlow?

01:18.506 --> 01:19.772
Clay Sherwood.

01:19.772 --> 01:23.014
Perkins. Class of '99.
You work for Buchanan?

01:23.014 --> 01:25.900
Yeah. Just came on board
this summer. You?

01:25.900 --> 01:28.608
District Sales Manager,
Southeast Asia.

01:28.608 --> 01:30.178
Listen. I'm in from Bangkok.

01:30.178 --> 01:33.025
I've got the night off.
You wanna grab dinner?

01:33.025 --> 01:34.646
I'll put in for it.

01:34.646 --> 01:36.453
Sure. That'd be great.

01:37.853 --> 01:40.184
It's just such an uptight company.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.665
Well, you know.

01:42.357 --> 01:45.002
When they transferred me to Thailand...

01:45.002 --> 01:46.219
Have you been?

01:46.219 --> 01:47.645
No.

01:47.645 --> 01:49.434
It's exotic.

01:49.831 --> 01:52.136
Between the lifestyle,
the girls...

01:52.136 --> 01:54.159
I lost it.

01:54.159 --> 01:56.020
My wife left,

01:56.020 --> 01:58.624
went back to her parents in Jersey...

01:58.836 --> 02:00.672
I'm sorry.

02:00.672 --> 02:03.025
I gotta make things right, Eric.

02:03.025 --> 02:05.748
I need to be transferred back here.

02:07.002 --> 02:10.253
I shouldn't be talking about this in public.

02:12.255 --> 02:14.758
You live around here,
don't you?

02:15.792 --> 02:18.869
Clay, I'm not comfortable with this.

02:18.869 --> 02:22.779
Without leverage,
I don't get that transfer.

02:23.481 --> 02:27.164
Look. My wife's got money.

02:32.625 --> 02:35.482
Yes? This is Eric.

02:35.748 --> 02:37.683
Oh, hey.

02:38.371 --> 02:40.135
Uh, let me check.

02:40.634 --> 02:42.093
Yeah.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.562
Found it.

02:46.163 --> 02:48.692
Sure.
I can leave it there for you.

02:48.912 --> 02:50.885
I won't.
Don't worry.

02:50.885 --> 02:52.455
Good night.

02:56.352 --> 02:57.732
Another beer?

02:57.732 --> 02:59.032
Yeah.

02:59.032 --> 03:00.441
If you want.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.847
But it's gettin' kinda late.

03:03.380 --> 03:08.204
Look, Clay, I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can do you this favor.

03:08.204 --> 03:10.057
It's too dicey.

03:11.771 --> 03:14.144
I don't think you have a choice, Eric.

03:15.370 --> 03:19.390
We need a firm guarantee this is happening.

03:19.390 --> 03:22.445
I guarantee it's under control.

03:22.445 --> 03:25.315
It took some persuasion,

03:25.315 --> 03:27.661
but he's gonna help us.

03:27.879 --> 03:29.906
I'd better finish packing.

03:35.533 --> 03:40.044
Mr. Sherwood left instructions to take
these to Air Thailand Cargo at J.F.K.

03:40.044 --> 03:43.093
- Paperwork's all filled out.
- All right.

03:45.649 --> 03:48.323
What's he got in here?
Bowling balls?

03:53.118 --> 03:55.472
Hey, what's on your hand?

03:58.209 --> 04:00.253
What is in there, man?

04:04.669 --> 04:07.274
Oh! There's somebody in there!

04:49.859 --> 04:53.194
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/02/22

04:56.481 --> 04:59.372
Torso's in the trunk.
Legs are in the other.

04:59.372 --> 05:02.950
Bags came from a room booked
to a Clayton Sherwood.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.748
The room is booked to his employer,
Clarendon Pharmaceuticals.

05:05.748 --> 05:07.370
The pieces add up to Mr. Sherwood?

05:07.370 --> 05:09.623
Don't know.
We're tracking down a photo I.D.

05:09.623 --> 05:12.693
Sherwood told the front desk this morning
he was checkin' out tonight.

05:12.693 --> 05:14.010
Last time anyone saw him?

05:14.010 --> 05:15.574
Room service at 3:00.

05:15.574 --> 05:19.456
At 5:20, someone claiming to be him
called from outside the hotel

05:19.456 --> 05:21.775
to have the bags delivered to
air cargo at J.F.K.

05:21.775 --> 05:23.030
To be shipped where?

05:23.030 --> 05:25.441
Bangkok.
Where he worked.

05:25.915 --> 05:27.798
The paperwork was typed up
and ready to go.

05:27.798 --> 05:30.251
Two new suitcases.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.185
Maybe this beats traveling economy.

05:39.185 --> 05:42.815
Ligature marks, thick ones,
probably from a belt.

05:42.815 --> 05:45.551
Three silk teddies.

05:45.776 --> 05:47.590
Three bottles of perfume.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.112
Three girlfriends?

05:49.112 --> 05:52.050
And one platinum wedding band.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.441
A tan line where his watch should be.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.219
Looks like the body was drained of blood.

05:57.219 --> 05:59.455
There's some spillage over here.

06:07.136 --> 06:10.954
And the texture of this stain is
gummier than the others.

06:12.673 --> 06:16.546
I need this stain tested at the lab, please.

06:18.291 --> 06:19.824
We got here before the maid did.

06:19.824 --> 06:21.026
No blood evident.

06:21.026 --> 06:23.167
Just what the leuco brought up.

06:24.777 --> 06:28.115
Knife strikes in the tub.
Sherwood was chopped up in here.

06:28.115 --> 06:29.533
So the rest of the room...

06:29.533 --> 06:31.281
It was like this?

06:31.281 --> 06:33.110
Yes. No sign of a struggle.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.251
No personal items left behind.

06:35.251 --> 06:38.417
We're checkin' the garbage chute,
Dumpsters.

06:41.509 --> 06:45.081
These are carpet fibers.

06:45.081 --> 06:47.329
The bowl was knocked over...

06:47.329 --> 06:49.053
maybe in the struggle.

06:49.053 --> 06:52.081
The perp put everything back in its place.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.493
Not everything.

06:58.195 --> 07:01.124
It's a broken stylus tip.

07:03.868 --> 07:07.498
We need to find the electronic
organizer this belongs to.

07:07.498 --> 07:09.183
Got the safe open.

07:09.534 --> 07:11.511
Somebody tried to pry it out of the cabinet.

07:11.511 --> 07:13.968
Let's see what they were after.

07:14.324 --> 07:16.827
Sherwood's passport.

07:18.721 --> 07:21.577
Plane ticket. Itinerary.

07:22.585 --> 07:25.679
Cash and traveler's checks.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.147
And a watch.

07:30.273 --> 07:32.778
An $8,000 watch.

07:32.778 --> 07:36.524
He must've been worried it would be stolen.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.738
Sherwood's itinerary has him
staying here two nights.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.811
He was leaving a day early.

07:41.811 --> 07:45.711
Maybe he was worried he wouldn't
make it out of Dodge in one piece.

07:46.063 --> 07:47.705
Clarendon Pharmaceuticals
Office Of Steve Johannsen
164 West 32nd Street
Friday, February 13

07:47.705 --> 07:51.468
Clay said he had personal reasons
for leaving early.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.349
I didn't pry.

07:55.799 --> 08:00.064
How anyone could do this to another
human being...

08:00.064 --> 08:02.658
Mr. Sherwood was in town on business?

08:02.658 --> 08:08.091
Uh, yes. He was our sales manager
for Southeast Asia for blood products.

08:08.091 --> 08:10.577
Who had he seen since he arrived?

08:10.577 --> 08:14.677
Uh, me, Bernard Mailer...
He's director of manufacturing.

08:14.677 --> 08:16.189
I believe that's it.

08:16.189 --> 08:20.312
We got a list of his calls from the hotel.

08:20.312 --> 08:22.446
Do you recognize any of those numbers?

08:22.446 --> 08:23.979
These are ours.

08:23.979 --> 08:26.513
These could be his in-laws
in Saddle River.

08:26.513 --> 08:28.263
His wife's staying with them.

08:28.263 --> 08:30.905
And he was staying in a hotel?

08:31.240 --> 08:34.090
Bangkok didn't agree with Patsy.

08:34.090 --> 08:36.833
She came back a few months ago.

08:37.501 --> 08:40.828
What about these numbers in Bangkok?

08:41.039 --> 08:43.326
That's ours. That's our office there.

08:43.326 --> 08:45.560
And these three I don't recognize.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.406
He called at all hours of the night.

08:47.406 --> 08:50.230
Maybe to get their lingerie sizes.

08:52.914 --> 08:56.699
Clay had a complicated personal life.

08:56.699 --> 08:58.782
His wife could speak to that.

08:59.181 --> 09:04.747
He said he was coming home
to patch things up, but he...

09:05.445 --> 09:07.454
God. I'm sorry.

09:08.018 --> 09:10.489
He just didn't deserve this.

09:10.489 --> 09:15.361
He said he wanted to patch things up,
but...

09:15.361 --> 09:19.519
We were supposed to go for
dinner Wednesday,

09:19.519 --> 09:23.265
but at the last minute,
he said he had a business dinner...

09:23.265 --> 09:26.194
someone at work,
a college buddy.

09:26.194 --> 09:31.220
His phone records show that he called
you from the hotel Thursday around noon.

09:31.220 --> 09:34.678
We had an appointment with
a counselor that afternoon.

09:34.678 --> 09:35.892
Clay's idea.

09:35.892 --> 09:38.229
But he bailed again?

09:39.402 --> 09:42.301
I told him it was his last chance.

09:42.301 --> 09:44.578
He said he didn't care,

09:44.578 --> 09:46.648
that he was going back to Bangkok...

09:46.648 --> 09:50.586
that I could tell my family
he didn't need their money.

09:50.586 --> 09:53.849
But he said he wanted
to come back into town?

09:53.849 --> 09:56.527
He was sincere about reconciling?

09:56.527 --> 09:58.143
Yes.

09:59.196 --> 10:02.171
He even sounded desperate.

10:03.325 --> 10:05.286
That's all he talked about?
His wife?

10:05.286 --> 10:06.709
And his girlfriends.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.466
He said he was living it up in Bangkok.

10:08.466 --> 10:11.251
No bull, Dunlow.
He didn't say anything else?

10:11.251 --> 10:13.052
No, Mr. Mailer.

10:13.052 --> 10:16.913
I think he just wanted to
let off some steam.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.287
They found Sherwood's Palm Pilot.

10:25.287 --> 10:29.123
It was swimming in five inches of soup
in a hotel Dumpster.

10:29.123 --> 10:32.257
No prints off the shipping forms
or the suitcases.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.883
Nothing from the hotel room.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.398
He was desperate to reconcile
with his wife.

10:36.398 --> 10:39.871
He was scared.
He was looking for a safe harbor.

10:40.352 --> 10:43.150
But whatever was hanging over him,

10:43.150 --> 10:46.115
it was resolved by the next day.

10:46.115 --> 10:48.158
After his night out with a college buddy.

10:48.158 --> 10:51.753
Well, Clarendon has a dozen employees
who went to Perkins.

10:52.196 --> 10:54.673
Eames. / A couple of them could've
been there the same time as Sherwood.

10:54.673 --> 10:56.280
Sure. We'll be right over.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.639
The lab thinks the killer might've
left a calling card.

10:59.924 --> 11:01.741
We analyzed the bloodstain
on the envelope.

11:01.741 --> 11:04.374
We found the victim's D.N. A...
mixed in with the D.N.A.

11:04.374 --> 11:06.623
- Of other individuals.
- Individuals?

11:06.623 --> 11:08.300
More than one killer?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.473
I'm running the data through
the genotyper software now.

11:10.473 --> 11:13.407
And I found this inside the envelope.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.356
It's glass with green paper.

11:15.356 --> 11:17.012
Origin unknown.

11:17.012 --> 11:18.105
Here we go.

11:18.105 --> 11:19.689
Oh, this is interesting.

11:20.787 --> 11:25.814
Along with the victim's D.N.A., we might
have as many as 10 other contributors.

11:25.814 --> 11:28.465
When they make pharmaceutical
blood products,

11:28.465 --> 11:33.922
don't they sometimes pull the blood
from multiple donors...

11:33.922 --> 11:36.886
so that all the D.N.A. Is in the product?

11:36.886 --> 11:37.925
Sure.

11:37.925 --> 11:44.112
Could you test the envelope for D.N.A.,
and, uh, this?

11:45.046 --> 11:49.528
Sherwood worked in the blood
products division at Clarendon.

11:49.528 --> 11:52.168
That piece of glass could be
from a broken vial.

11:52.168 --> 11:54.796
He's a salesman.
Salesmen carry samples.

11:54.796 --> 11:56.923
But a loose vial in an envelope?

11:56.923 --> 11:59.354
It must be a very special sample,

11:59.354 --> 12:03.375
maybe special enough to
get Sherwood killed.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.216
He told me he was staying until Friday.

12:08.216 --> 12:10.974
He was hoping to get reassigned
to the home office.

12:10.974 --> 12:14.886
Did he get any calls or say
he was expecting news?

12:14.886 --> 12:17.234
No. Uh-uh.

12:17.476 --> 12:20.256
This picture was taken north
of Malibu, right?

12:20.256 --> 12:23.104
- Perkins School is in Malibu.
- Right.

12:23.104 --> 12:26.765
Uh, that picture's actually closer to Catalina.

12:27.272 --> 12:28.802
Perkins must be a real grind.

12:28.802 --> 12:30.956
Not if you spend most of your time
on the water.

12:30.956 --> 12:31.996
Which you did?

12:31.996 --> 12:33.400
Let me put it to you this way:

12:33.400 --> 12:39.106
UCLA Med School used the sailing team
as guinea pigs for a skin cancer study.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.720
And that's where you met Sherwood,
isn't it? On the sailing team?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.204
The truth?

12:44.710 --> 12:46.527
I didn't really know him.

12:46.527 --> 12:50.347
Maybe we were at a few
student functions together. / Hmm.

12:50.347 --> 12:53.469
He told his wife you were old buddies.

12:53.469 --> 12:55.728
Well, he played it that way.

12:55.728 --> 13:00.990
He was working me so I'd put in
a good word with my boss, Mr. Buchanan.

13:00.990 --> 13:04.077
He is senior V.P.
Of blood products.

13:04.077 --> 13:05.738
You're an assistant.

13:05.738 --> 13:07.411
Yes.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.283
I took a few years off after Perkins to sail.

13:12.012 --> 13:15.776
Well, Sherwood must've been in
deep trouble to ask for your help.

13:15.776 --> 13:17.233
I couldn't help him.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.000
He'd gone around the bend in Bangkok.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.273
That doesn't go over at Clarendon.

13:21.273 --> 13:22.812
"Clotting factor eight."

13:22.812 --> 13:24.435
Is this medication to clot blood?

13:24.435 --> 13:26.873
It's for hemophiliacs.

13:27.692 --> 13:30.665
Look. The vials.
They have green labels.

13:30.665 --> 13:33.174
All our blood products have green labels.

13:33.383 --> 13:34.829
Excuse me.

13:38.515 --> 13:41.727
The blood on the envelope in the suitcase...

13:41.727 --> 13:44.310
It was gummier than the others?

13:45.296 --> 13:47.383
It was clotting faster.

13:47.383 --> 13:50.145
The lab found the same hemophilia drug

13:50.145 --> 13:53.543
on the glass shard and in the blood drop.

13:53.543 --> 13:55.218
Clotting factor eight.

13:55.218 --> 13:57.716
- Derived from human plasma.
- There are other kinds?

13:57.716 --> 13:59.534
There's synthetic factor eight.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.618
Clarendon's is called Hemovate.

14:01.618 --> 14:03.721
It's safer than human plasma factor eight,

14:03.721 --> 14:06.424
and Clarendon can charge more for it.

14:06.424 --> 14:11.002
Well, they have synthetic in here,
but I didn't see the other kind.

14:11.002 --> 14:13.787
They phased out the plasma products in 2001.

14:13.787 --> 14:17.202
I guess that would make it a special sample.

14:19.181 --> 14:24.714
This P.D.R. From 2001.
Clarendon Pharmaceuticals.

14:24.714 --> 14:25.647
Here.

14:25.647 --> 14:29.037
Human plasma,
factor eight.

14:29.037 --> 14:31.739
The vials have white labels,

14:31.739 --> 14:35.241
and the synthetic...

14:35.448 --> 14:37.813
have green labels.

14:38.497 --> 14:42.849
Someone's passing off human
plasma as synthetic.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.808
Counterfeit medications?

14:44.808 --> 14:47.096
My God. We had no idea.

14:47.096 --> 14:48.492
Sherwood was involved?

14:48.492 --> 14:51.657
The vial was in an envelope
bearing his fingerprints.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.311
Maybe he was about to blow the whistle?

14:53.311 --> 14:54.729
He never said anything to us.

14:54.729 --> 14:56.668
Maybe somebody else was about
to blow the whistle,

14:56.668 --> 14:58.748
and that's why he rushed home.

14:58.748 --> 15:00.539
It's possible. Look,

15:00.539 --> 15:02.351
we're caught unawares here.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.019
Unawares?

15:05.730 --> 15:11.016
Gentlemen, you don't want us finding
out later that Clarendon covered up a scandal.

15:11.016 --> 15:13.890
That's not how we do things at Clarendon.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.656
We'll go through our records.

15:15.656 --> 15:18.783
We will send you everything we find.

15:21.150 --> 15:24.340
What did you find out from
the embassy in Bangkok?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.036
They have lovely fax cover sheets,

15:27.036 --> 15:31.594
but nothing on Sherwood or
any counterfeiting ring in Thailand.

15:31.818 --> 15:34.557
If it was a Thai counterfeiting ring,

15:34.557 --> 15:36.224
they would've killed Sherwood
on their own turf,

15:36.224 --> 15:38.564
where they have a better chance of
getting away with it. / Eames.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.018
Maybe they didn't trust him to keep
his mouth shut till then.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.618
We'll be right over.
That was Forensics.

15:43.618 --> 15:46.980
Sherwood's Palm Pilot is
out of intensive care.

15:48.466 --> 15:50.411
The phone book and text files are gone,

15:50.411 --> 15:53.163
but his calendar is intact.

15:53.163 --> 15:56.850
Well, try the murder date...
last Thursday. / Mm-hmm.

15:59.230 --> 16:02.801
That's the info for his flight back to Bangkok.

16:02.801 --> 16:05.107
Try Wednesday.

16:05.786 --> 16:07.464
His flight to New York.

16:07.464 --> 16:09.446
Yeah, that icon...

16:09.446 --> 16:12.013
There's a note attached to the entry.

16:13.875 --> 16:17.005
K. Teasdale and Dr. Pirapan.

16:17.005 --> 16:19.439
On the same day he changed flights.

16:19.439 --> 16:23.153
That looks like a Bangkok phone number.

16:23.153 --> 16:26.309
"253." That's... familiar.

16:27.478 --> 16:30.850
Yeah. That's the same prefix
as the U.S. Embassy.

16:31.933 --> 16:37.658
Um, that acronym after Teasdale's
name..."FODAG."

16:37.658 --> 16:39.724
Food and Agriculture.

16:39.724 --> 16:42.314
A government employee?

16:43.020 --> 16:45.940
A Thai doctor and an embassy attache.

16:45.940 --> 16:46.916
Throw in the girlfriends,

16:46.916 --> 16:49.184
and Sherwood's life is sounding like
a Graham Greene novel.

16:49.184 --> 16:51.038
Yes. Got that. Thank you.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.713
Our embassy attache,
Kenny Teasdale?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.280
He's eight years old.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.702
It's his father who works for
Food and Agriculture,

16:57.702 --> 17:00.995
but the assistant said Kenny and
his mom are here on medical leave.

17:00.995 --> 17:03.193
They're staying at the Watson.

17:03.193 --> 17:07.193
That's 67 th, right across from
Sloan-Kettering Hospital.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.510
I don't want anybody sitting
on bad news, Steve.

17:09.510 --> 17:11.099
We get the facts out...

17:11.099 --> 17:12.587
That's how we protect the brand.

17:12.587 --> 17:14.301
I understand, Gordon.

17:21.589 --> 17:22.964
Yes, Eric?

17:22.964 --> 17:26.262
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.098
Well, that's why I keep the door open.

17:29.692 --> 17:32.194
I wanted to tell you this before,
Mr. Buchanan,

17:32.194 --> 17:34.525
but you were out of town.

17:35.406 --> 17:37.660
The police asked me about Sherwood,

17:37.660 --> 17:42.438
and there's something I didn't tell them
because I wanted to talk to you first.

17:46.287 --> 17:49.121
Maybe you'd better close the door.

17:49.422 --> 17:52.563
Dr. Pirapan is Kenny's doctor in Bangkok,

17:52.563 --> 17:54.919
but we don't know anyone named Sherwood.

17:54.919 --> 17:58.061
Dr. Pirapan's a pediatrician?

17:58.061 --> 18:00.199
He specializes in hemophilia.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.259
That's what Kenny has.

18:02.259 --> 18:05.457
His medication is factor eight Hemovate,

18:05.457 --> 18:06.925
manufactured by Clarendon?

18:06.925 --> 18:08.275
He's taken it.

18:08.275 --> 18:10.431
Do you have any with you?

18:10.431 --> 18:14.080
My husband says I carry
an emergency room with me,

18:14.080 --> 18:15.973
but with Kenny...

18:16.461 --> 18:19.248
How did you know he was taking Hemovate?

18:19.248 --> 18:22.941
Mr. Sherwood worked for
Clarendon in Thailand.

18:23.344 --> 18:25.582
Green labels.

18:26.248 --> 18:27.691
Where'd you buy this?

18:27.691 --> 18:30.583
At a local pharmacy the embassy uses.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.320
Why? Is there something wrong with it?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.903
Probably not.
Can I have this?

18:34.903 --> 18:38.282
- Will you have enough?
- Oh, you can have the whole box.

18:38.282 --> 18:42.458
Dr. Pirapan switched Kenny off
Hemovate last week.

18:42.674 --> 18:44.726
Why's that?

18:47.409 --> 18:50.606
Kenny's condition has changed.

18:50.892 --> 18:53.768
He's gotten H.I.V.

18:55.618 --> 18:59.439
We don't know how or when, but...

19:01.546 --> 19:05.199
That's why we're here...
to see what we can do.

19:05.852 --> 19:08.398
I'm very sorry.

19:10.437 --> 19:12.474
There's my little boy!

19:16.756 --> 19:18.604
Mom!

19:24.641 --> 19:26.759
It's these meds.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.569
That's how the boy got it.

19:28.569 --> 19:33.273
Sherwood and his friends are
selling contaminated meds.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.727
Tell you what.

19:34.727 --> 19:37.412
Sherwood got off easy.

19:42.426 --> 19:44.092
Even though they're labeled synthetic,

19:44.092 --> 19:47.134
every one of those vials contained
human plasma factor eight,

19:47.134 --> 19:50.889
and every one of them was
contaminated with H.I.V.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.507
Aren't plasma donors screened
for H.I.V.?

19:53.507 --> 19:55.611
Yes, but it's not foolproof.

19:55.611 --> 20:00.281
Clarendon would've treated its plasma
with heat and detergents. / Hmm.

20:00.281 --> 20:02.029
There was a problem in the manufacturing?

20:02.029 --> 20:03.076
Probably.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.917
Which is why Clarendon switched
to synthetic factor eight.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.782
It's safe from blood-borne diseases.

20:07.782 --> 20:10.902
Any evidence Mr. Sherwood knew
about the contamination?

20:10.902 --> 20:12.432
Kenny's doctor in Bangkok

20:12.432 --> 20:16.285
told the distributor he suspected factor
eight was the source of the infection.

20:16.285 --> 20:18.947
The distributor told us
he alerted Sherwood.

20:18.947 --> 20:23.062
Sherwood was on a plane to
New York the next day.

20:23.062 --> 20:25.468
Clarendon Pharmaceuticals
Quality Control Office
Bayonne, New Jersey
Monday, February 23

20:25.468 --> 20:27.200
Human plasma factor eight?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.652
We switched to synthetic two years ago.

20:29.652 --> 20:32.130
Maybe I should get one of our scientists
up here to explain.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.004
That's okay.
We brought our own.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.532
I found something.

20:35.532 --> 20:39.004
November 8, 2001:
Your logs indicate...

20:39.004 --> 20:41.980
a malfunction was detected in
one of the heat treatment ovens.

20:41.980 --> 20:43.714
Sure. We shut down the production line.

20:43.714 --> 20:45.474
How long had the oven been malfunctioning?

20:45.474 --> 20:46.620
'Bout a week.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.954
As a precaution, I ordered the previous
two weeks'production scrapped,

20:49.954 --> 20:52.128
incinerated at a disposal plant.

20:52.128 --> 20:54.704
We'd like to see documentation.

20:56.253 --> 20:58.161
You know, out of curiosity,

20:58.161 --> 21:00.868
how much is it worth,
two weeks of this factor eight?

21:00.868 --> 21:03.830
Around $15 million.

21:04.116 --> 21:06.811
All right.
November, 2001.

21:06.811 --> 21:10.543
The batch was shipped to our storage
facility prior to disposal.

21:10.543 --> 21:14.151
- This is the receipt.
- And the receipt for the incinerator?

21:14.151 --> 21:17.468
You just give the word,
and $15 million goes up in smoke?

21:17.468 --> 21:20.262
Now, the final authorization has
to come from the head office...

21:20.262 --> 21:24.410
from Gordon Buchanan,
the senior V.P. Of blood products.

21:25.269 --> 21:26.470
Problem?

21:26.470 --> 21:30.747
- I can't find that receipt.
- That go up in smoke too?

21:31.264 --> 21:33.437
I didn't know there were any drugs
needing to be destroyed.

21:33.437 --> 21:35.332
I didn't even know there'd
been a malfunction.

21:35.332 --> 21:37.382
A little thing like that,
and nobody told you.

21:37.382 --> 21:40.522
No. No one told the boss that they'd
made a $15 million mistake.

21:40.522 --> 21:44.433
If they had, it would've registered,
and I would've issued that authorization.

21:44.433 --> 21:49.514
I hope so, because those drugs
were contaminated with H.I.V.

21:51.672 --> 21:54.631
Somebody relabeled the drugs
and dumped 'em in Thailand.

21:54.631 --> 21:58.529
Southeast Asia being
an AIDS disaster area,

21:58.529 --> 22:03.792
I guess they figured a thousand or
so more cases wouldn't be noticed.

22:06.878 --> 22:08.955
You look angry, Mr. Buchanan.

22:08.955 --> 22:13.586
"Angry" doesn't come close to
describing how I feel.

22:13.768 --> 22:16.531
That this happened on my watch...
I'm...

22:16.531 --> 22:18.648
Those dopes.

22:18.648 --> 22:20.985
You don't think Sherwood pulled
this off on his own?

22:20.985 --> 22:23.592
Maybe he could've shipped
the drugs overseas,

22:23.592 --> 22:25.759
but bypassing the disposal,
getting 'em out of storage...

22:25.759 --> 22:27.125
Eric, would you come in here,
please?

22:27.125 --> 22:29.601
There are some things my assistant
didn't tell you when you spoke with him.

22:29.601 --> 22:32.172
He wanted to run 'em by me first.

22:32.327 --> 22:36.234
Eric, tell them what you told me
about Sherwood.

22:36.849 --> 22:38.648
It's all right. It's all right.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.279
Sherwood...

22:41.279 --> 22:45.335
offered me money to download
a document I don't know what...

22:45.335 --> 22:48.485
from a disk onto
Mr. Buchanan's computer.

22:48.485 --> 22:51.858
He said it would give him leverage
for a transfer to the head office.

22:51.858 --> 22:53.252
Where's the disk now?

22:53.252 --> 22:54.252
I don't know.

22:54.252 --> 22:56.495
I didn't take it.
I turned him down.

22:56.495 --> 22:58.486
Sherwood was trying to sandbag me.

22:58.486 --> 23:00.937
By putting an incriminating
document in your files

23:00.937 --> 23:04.273
to force you to help with a cover-up.

23:04.273 --> 23:05.658
Yeah.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.144
Tell 'em the rest, Eric.

23:08.144 --> 23:12.722
Um, the day after Sherwood was killed,

23:12.722 --> 23:16.542
Mr. Mailer asked me what
Sherwood and me talked about.

23:16.542 --> 23:18.427
I lied.

23:18.427 --> 23:21.272
I told them that we just talked
about Sherwood's marriage.

23:21.272 --> 23:24.296
In November, 2001,
Mailer was manager of operations.

23:24.296 --> 23:29.067
He would absolutely have known
about any malfunctions.

23:29.354 --> 23:32.649
Of course I knew the drugs were
scheduled to be destroyed,

23:32.649 --> 23:34.721
but if Buchanan never sent
the authorization...

23:34.721 --> 23:37.001
That doesn't explain how
they ended up in Thailand.

23:37.001 --> 23:39.435
You would have to ask Sherwood.

23:39.890 --> 23:43.111
Ask Sherwood?
You're a funny guy.

23:44.571 --> 23:46.996
Mr. Mailer's simply explaining that

23:46.996 --> 23:49.480
he had no knowledge of
Mr. Sherwood's scheme.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.905
How about Sherwood's dinner
with Eric Dunlow?

23:51.905 --> 23:53.924
What knowledge does he have about that?

23:53.924 --> 23:58.184
Sherwood told Dr. Johannsen and
me that he'd gotten in trouble over some

23:58.184 --> 24:00.724
recycled clotting factor in Thailand.

24:00.724 --> 24:02.182
He threatened us if we didn't help him.

24:02.182 --> 24:05.230
He said he'd already dirtied up Buchanan
and he'd do the same to us,

24:05.230 --> 24:06.487
but we refused.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.039
Very brave of you, but we would've
preferred to hear this a week ago.

24:10.039 --> 24:11.955
- You're hearing it now.
- You have to understand.

24:11.955 --> 24:14.270
We never connected this recycled
clotting factor

24:14.270 --> 24:16.526
with the batch that should've been
destroyed two years ago.

24:16.526 --> 24:18.907
Excuse us, gentlemen.

24:19.574 --> 24:22.310
Sherwood said he had already
compromised Buchanan,

24:22.310 --> 24:25.315
that he'd take the whole division down
unless we helped him.

24:25.315 --> 24:28.508
Dr. Johannsen,
it's incredible to me

24:28.508 --> 24:31.725
that a salesman can transport
$15 million dollars'

24:31.725 --> 24:33.352
worth of medicine halfway around the world,

24:33.352 --> 24:36.565
repackage it and sell it,
all without your knowledge.

24:36.565 --> 24:39.145
First I heard of it was on that Wednesday.

24:39.145 --> 24:44.204
- Sherwood said he'd already compromised...
- Doctor, we heard you the first time.

24:47.503 --> 24:50.350
Doctor, tell me something.
When you decided to dump this stuff,

24:50.350 --> 24:55.422
what'd you do? Flip a coin?
You know...heads, Asia, tails, Africa?

24:57.560 --> 25:00.446
We can't find any records that
lead to Mailer or Johannsen.

25:00.446 --> 25:03.389
The trail ends at Sherwood.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.838
Sherwood had a lot riding on this.

25:07.329 --> 25:11.041
He had to believe that he had Eric
in his pocket.

25:11.577 --> 25:15.937
- Sherwood liked leverage.
- Maybe he had some on Eric.

25:16.536 --> 25:19.380
The hotel safe.

25:20.059 --> 25:22.364
The killers tried to break into it.

25:22.364 --> 25:23.978
What was in there?

25:23.978 --> 25:26.609
Sherwood's passport,
his plane ticket...

25:26.609 --> 25:28.118
A watch.

25:28.118 --> 25:31.359
Right. Sherwood's watch.

25:34.306 --> 25:35.772
It doesn't match.

25:35.772 --> 25:38.249
Sherwood wore a bigger watch.

25:38.249 --> 25:41.268
The killer couldn't break into the safe,

25:42.409 --> 25:44.628
so he took Sherwood's watch

25:44.628 --> 25:47.710
so when we found this one,
we would assume it was Sherwood's.

25:47.710 --> 25:50.771
And wouldn't look for its real owner.

25:58.244 --> 26:01.254
Registration number.
We can trace it.

26:01.254 --> 26:06.265
And there's a hair caught
in the inside of the band.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.847
It could be Eric's or Sherwood's.

26:10.039 --> 26:12.378
The root's attached.

26:12.378 --> 26:17.202
- We can match the D.N.A.
- We've got Sherwood's, but Eric's...

26:21.865 --> 26:24.536
The skin cancer study at Perkins.

26:24.536 --> 26:27.896
UCLA might still have tissue samples.

26:28.696 --> 26:32.883
No. I heard the sailing's terrific
in Sardinia.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.363
Okay. Tell him his buddy
from Perkins called,

26:35.363 --> 26:39.849
the one who helped him sink
the J-24 off Anacapa.

26:43.951 --> 26:46.808
So if we can stay with the fleet
and play the odds,

26:46.808 --> 26:48.844
- we'll be in the game.
- Don't be so dramatic.

26:48.844 --> 26:53.735
There is not a boat out there
that stands a chance against this crew.

27:01.956 --> 27:05.570
It's marrow. Use a little spoon.
It's very good.

27:07.879 --> 27:10.978
Latent found one of Sherwood's prints
on the crystal,

27:10.978 --> 27:14.614
but they found Eric's prints
on the band and the clasp.

27:14.614 --> 27:16.785
So chances are Eric's the proud owner.

27:16.785 --> 27:18.660
The hair isn't Sherwood's.

27:18.660 --> 27:23.039
It didn't match Eric's D.N.A.
From the UCLA study.

27:23.039 --> 27:24.256
So a big nothing?

27:24.256 --> 27:25.832
Maybe not. The lab is saying...

27:25.832 --> 27:30.879
it's a pubic hair from a male Caucasian.

27:31.722 --> 27:34.573
Eric got some guy's pubic hair tangled
in his watchband?

27:34.573 --> 27:36.481
There aren't that many ways that
can happen.

27:36.481 --> 27:37.975
Eric's gay?

27:37.975 --> 27:39.780
That was Sherwood's leverage?

27:39.780 --> 27:42.963
This is a secret Eric thought
was worth killing for?

27:42.963 --> 27:45.527
Well, it depends whose secret it is.

27:50.225 --> 27:54.353
Eric spent his lunchtime in the gym,
and after that, he was back in the office.

27:54.353 --> 27:56.315
You saw him there between 3:00 and 5:00?

27:56.315 --> 27:59.381
No. I was in a board meeting,
but I popped back in a couple times.

27:59.381 --> 28:03.711
I saw him editing a presentation
on his computer.

28:03.711 --> 28:06.093
An hour later,
the presentation was on his printer.

28:06.093 --> 28:08.460
We think Sherwood was blackmailing him.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.161
He's gay, isn't he?

28:10.795 --> 28:11.867
Well, I couldn't say,

28:11.867 --> 28:15.932
but I would think his generation's
immune to that kind of blackmail.

28:15.932 --> 28:17.431
Even at Clarendon?

28:17.431 --> 28:20.074
Granted, they're "don't ask, don't tell,"
but Eric is bright.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.897
He would land on his feet.

28:21.897 --> 28:25.978
He's... loyal too.

28:27.432 --> 28:31.361
Maybe it wasn't his career he was protecting.

28:32.484 --> 28:34.472
Good hunch, Detective.

28:34.472 --> 28:40.096
Well, it was your reaction to the H.I.V.
Contamination. I thought it was...

28:40.096 --> 28:42.094
profound.

28:42.094 --> 28:44.892
I would think any person would
have the same reaction.

28:44.892 --> 28:48.934
As for Eric, loyal or not, my being gay
is no reason for him to commit murder.

28:48.934 --> 28:50.361
But if you were outed...

28:50.361 --> 28:52.341
I work because I wanna,
not because I have to.

28:52.341 --> 28:53.970
Your family? Your kids?

28:53.970 --> 28:56.675
They already know the old man's gay.

28:57.321 --> 29:00.490
So maybe Eric is worried about his own job.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.713
Like I said, he'd land on his feet.
I'd make sure he did.

29:04.903 --> 29:08.784
So the loyalty goes both ways.

29:08.784 --> 29:10.561
Are you lovers?

29:11.195 --> 29:15.649
Give me a little credit.
I don't chase after secretaries.

29:18.546 --> 29:20.841
- How did you meet?
- Through friends.

29:20.841 --> 29:25.008
We share a passion for sailing,
and Eric... sails like a pirate.

29:25.008 --> 29:26.417
These friends...

29:26.417 --> 29:30.762
Are they like you...
older, corporate executives? / Mm-hmm.

29:30.762 --> 29:34.773
Well, you must trust him a lot to bring
him into your inner circle.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.256
I trust him implicitly.

29:38.565 --> 29:42.151
It's not the greatest alibi,
but maybe Buchanan's right.

29:42.151 --> 29:43.798
Maybe Eric didn't kill Sherwood.

29:43.798 --> 29:47.488
- Not for the reason we thought.
- Or to protect the man we thought.

29:48.241 --> 29:50.245
The Swiss finally traced
the number on the watch.

29:50.245 --> 29:53.057
Harold Heaton on Fifth Avenue.

29:53.727 --> 29:56.236
Home Of Harold & Ashley Heaton
382 Fifth Avenue
Tuesday, March 3

29:56.236 --> 29:57.502
You found my watch?

29:57.502 --> 30:00.138
- Your watch?
- Yeah. It fell off in the park.

30:00.138 --> 30:01.774
The clasp was broken.

30:01.774 --> 30:03.005
When can I get it back?

30:03.005 --> 30:07.876
Well, actually, we didn't see
that the clasp was broken.

30:07.876 --> 30:09.179
As the owner of record,

30:09.179 --> 30:12.093
your husband'll have to
come down and identify it.

30:12.093 --> 30:14.749
Oh, come on.
Can't I just...

30:14.749 --> 30:15.610
All right.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.564
I left it at a friend's.

30:17.564 --> 30:19.183
She was returning it when...

30:19.183 --> 30:22.700
He was returning it when
he got pick pocketed in the subway.

30:22.700 --> 30:23.892
Your friend's name?

30:23.892 --> 30:26.390
I just have his first name... Eric.

30:28.547 --> 30:30.080
That's him.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.911
Don't tell me he's some kind of crook?

30:31.911 --> 30:34.194
Tell me. How'd you end up at his place?

30:34.194 --> 30:37.530
I met him at the gym.
He invited me over for lunch.

30:37.530 --> 30:40.909
- I don't normally...
- Normally, you don't...

30:43.427 --> 30:44.458
How 'bout him?

30:44.458 --> 30:45.900
Even while I was at his place,

30:45.900 --> 30:51.467
he was on his wi-fi P.D.A. Whatchamacallit
getting and sending messages.

30:51.467 --> 30:53.508
Eric's a player.

30:53.508 --> 30:55.474
The watch just came off.

30:55.474 --> 30:57.661
The damn bracelet got snagged,
so I took it off.

30:57.661 --> 31:02.861
You mean, while you
were caressing him intimately?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.655
Yes.

31:05.456 --> 31:08.282
- You ask the weirdest questions.
- You have no idea.

31:08.282 --> 31:12.324
So you forgot about the watch
then you called Eric later?

31:12.324 --> 31:14.643
Yes. That Wednesday around midnight.

31:14.643 --> 31:17.587
He was in a hurry to get off the phone.
I think he had someone with him.

31:17.587 --> 31:19.956
I heard his other line pick up.

31:19.956 --> 31:21.573
And what exactly did he say?

31:21.573 --> 31:23.259
He found my watch while
we were on the phone.

31:23.259 --> 31:25.482
He said he'd leave it for me
at the gym the next day.

31:25.482 --> 31:29.586
And then a couple days later,
he said he was pick pocketed?

31:31.979 --> 31:34.018
I think he has a bit of a chip
on his shoulder.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.210
Chip? Chip?

31:36.400 --> 31:39.128
About what? / Women.

31:39.128 --> 31:40.496
He said women have the edge in life;

31:40.496 --> 31:43.714
they can always find someone
to take care of them.

31:43.714 --> 31:45.480
Oh, okay. Thank you.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.639
We'll show ourselves out.

31:47.872 --> 31:50.577
Doesn't sound like Eric bats
only for one team.

31:50.577 --> 31:53.056
It doesn't sound like Eric's Eric.

31:53.505 --> 31:55.295
It was Eric's hair in the watchband.

31:55.295 --> 31:58.962
It should've matched his D.N.A.
From the skin cancer study.

31:58.962 --> 32:03.442
Perkins e-mailed us everything
they had on Eric Dunlow.

32:03.442 --> 32:05.061
The photos of the sailing team,

32:05.061 --> 32:07.903
but they're all wearing sunglasses
and zinc oxide.

32:07.903 --> 32:09.873
Gay Students' Alliance Christmas Party.

32:09.873 --> 32:13.081
It says Eric's in here,
but it's just a sea of Santa hats.

32:13.081 --> 32:15.096
His family's from Seattle?

32:15.096 --> 32:16.408
Start workin' the phones.

32:16.408 --> 32:17.355
Here he is.

32:17.355 --> 32:19.728
He's identified in the caption.

32:20.420 --> 32:24.974
Right. There's nine guys,
eight names.

32:25.271 --> 32:26.627
And look at him.

32:26.627 --> 32:30.027
I mean, all the other guys are
posed and wearing team jackets.

32:30.027 --> 32:33.721
He's just wearing a regular Windbreaker.

32:34.159 --> 32:38.177
Kind of is hanging off to the side.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.011
Like he just stepped in.

32:43.622 --> 32:46.004
Uninvited.

32:47.155 --> 32:50.422
This is the real Eric Dunlow,

32:50.422 --> 32:53.149
and this is Brian Welton.

32:53.149 --> 32:57.531
Welton worked at the marina where
the Perkins team kept their boats.

32:57.531 --> 33:01.466
He even crewed on the Dunlows'
schooner up in Seattle one summer.

33:01.466 --> 33:02.890
During spring break four years ago,

33:02.890 --> 33:07.322
Eric O.D. 'd on ecstasy in
a gay nightclub in Seattle.

33:07.322 --> 33:11.334
He's in a nursing home
in a semi-vegetative state.

33:11.334 --> 33:12.885
No one outside the family knows.

33:12.885 --> 33:17.143
If someone calls Eric,
they're told that he's in Europe sailing.

33:17.143 --> 33:18.830
Now, he could either betray Buchanan,

33:18.830 --> 33:21.742
the man he's worked so hard to impress,

33:21.742 --> 33:26.921
or risk exposing his own deception.

33:26.921 --> 33:30.250
Nailing Eric for murder doesn't seem
like much of a consolation prize.

33:30.250 --> 33:33.359
Even that prize is beyond our reach.

33:33.359 --> 33:36.187
I don't see the evidence.

33:43.587 --> 33:45.599
Here's evidence.

33:46.951 --> 33:52.452
Uh, one stone, three birds.

33:54.631 --> 33:56.761
But they won't say anything to me.

33:56.761 --> 34:00.632
Sherwood told them he gave you a disk.

34:00.632 --> 34:02.383
But he didn't.
I didn't let him.

34:02.383 --> 34:04.280
They don't know that.

34:04.280 --> 34:07.499
We found this in Sherwood's room.

34:07.499 --> 34:09.512
It had a copy of the memo

34:09.512 --> 34:12.560
he wanted you to download onto
Mr. Buchanan's computer.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.268
That's not the disk he showed me.

34:14.268 --> 34:16.216
Obviously he made a copy.

34:16.216 --> 34:18.728
Uh, I don't know.

34:18.728 --> 34:21.545
They'd never believe me.

34:22.123 --> 34:25.260
You know I'm not a good liar.

34:25.534 --> 34:28.030
I feel bad for those people who got infected,

34:28.030 --> 34:32.110
but I'm not a cop,
and this isn't my responsibility.

34:32.110 --> 34:34.879
You should reconsider, Eric.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.724
- Mr. Buchanan...
- I count you among my friends,

34:37.724 --> 34:41.516
and I expect my friends to show
some character when it matters.

34:41.516 --> 34:44.460
This matters.

34:46.983 --> 34:49.614
$500,000?

34:49.614 --> 34:51.844
You told me Sherwood didn't give
you anything.

34:51.844 --> 34:54.755
I just hadn't realized its value,

34:54.755 --> 35:00.871
but now I figure a hundred bucks a head
for everyone you infected.

35:00.871 --> 35:02.773
I'm not buyin' a pig in a poke.

35:02.773 --> 35:04.476
Let's see what's on there.

35:04.476 --> 35:08.479
This isn't going anywhere near
one of your computers.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.173
Fine.

35:15.173 --> 35:17.609
I'm walkin' this down the hall to Buchanan.

35:17.609 --> 35:20.502
We'll call the police together.

35:20.502 --> 35:22.381
Dunlow.

35:24.770 --> 35:27.405
You'll have the money
by the end of the week.

35:27.405 --> 35:32.066
I want a good faith payment now.
$9,000.

35:37.151 --> 35:38.642
They went for it.

35:38.642 --> 35:39.782
We heard.

35:39.782 --> 35:41.039
We need that check.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.552
You'll have the money
by the end of the week.

35:42.552 --> 35:44.482
Let's go pick 'em up.

35:47.304 --> 35:50.060
Look at you, huh?
You hardly broke a sweat.

35:50.060 --> 35:55.094
If we didn't know you better,
we'd swear you were a natural-born liar.

35:55.094 --> 35:57.475
I just did my best.

35:57.475 --> 36:02.050
Well, it helps that you weren't up
against criminal masterminds. Thanks.

36:02.050 --> 36:03.947
Show him the picture.

36:03.947 --> 36:06.713
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You'll appreciate this.

36:06.992 --> 36:10.216
They probably taught you this at Perkins.

36:10.216 --> 36:13.451
"Stupid employees are never as stupid
as the bosses that hire them."

36:13.451 --> 36:16.292
That's the safe in Sherwood's hotel room.

36:16.292 --> 36:17.935
Those marks on the wood?

36:17.935 --> 36:20.764
The killers tried to pull the safe
out of the cabinet.

36:20.764 --> 36:22.239
You know why?

36:22.239 --> 36:24.510
Because of the disk, of course.
That's where it was.

36:24.510 --> 36:25.469
Right.

36:25.469 --> 36:28.873
They killed Sherwood before getting
him to open the safe.

36:28.873 --> 36:33.209
First we thought it was thieves
trying to get Sherwood's watch.

36:33.209 --> 36:34.930
Remember it?

36:35.220 --> 36:36.971
I'm not sure.

36:37.733 --> 36:40.990
He would've been wearing it
Wednesday night.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.400
It was gold mother-of-pearl face.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.351
It would catch anyone's eye.

36:46.351 --> 36:48.645
Sure. I remember it now.

36:48.645 --> 36:51.113
I thought it was a knock off he got
in Thailand.

36:51.113 --> 36:53.192
No. It's the real thing.

36:53.192 --> 36:57.826
It even has a registration number,
which we traced.

37:04.157 --> 37:09.788
She seemed like she'd be
a lot of fun, Eric. Was she?

37:09.788 --> 37:11.815
So I occasionally sleep with women.

37:11.815 --> 37:13.869
So what? / So what?

37:13.869 --> 37:16.647
Didn't you just lie to us about the watch?

37:16.647 --> 37:18.413
Well, maybe he's a natural-born liar
after all.

37:18.413 --> 37:20.816
Look, I don't know one watch
from another.

37:20.816 --> 37:22.540
S...

37:24.426 --> 37:27.506
You didn't want Buchanan to find out
about the women,

37:27.506 --> 37:29.648
isn't that right?

37:29.945 --> 37:33.362
It would change his perception of you?

37:34.059 --> 37:37.247
That's what Sherwood had on you.

37:37.597 --> 37:41.391
And it was you who killed him,

37:41.391 --> 37:45.620
you who tried to take the safe

37:45.620 --> 37:47.256
for the watch.

37:47.256 --> 37:49.957
The disk was in there too.

37:50.165 --> 37:53.622
Mailer and Johannsen had
a reason to kill Sherwood, not me.

37:53.622 --> 37:56.304
Anyway, I was here working that afternoon.

37:56.304 --> 37:59.190
- Ask Mr. Buchanan.
- He didn't see you.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.910
He saw your work on the computer.

38:01.910 --> 38:05.555
Well, it didn't get done by itself.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.179
What are you doing?
That's mine.

38:08.179 --> 38:09.817
I know.

38:09.817 --> 38:12.815
We found it in your desk.

38:12.815 --> 38:16.380
Your girlfriend at the gym said
you kept checking it.

38:16.380 --> 38:18.363
Look at that.

38:21.706 --> 38:24.555
- Make it do something else.
- V.P.N. 's...

38:24.555 --> 38:27.271
Virtual Private Networks.

38:27.271 --> 38:30.040
You can control your computer
from anywhere in the world.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.908
Even while rackin' up nooners
with the ladies at the gym.

38:32.908 --> 38:36.946
Or carvin' up your old college buddies.

38:36.946 --> 38:39.367
You're wrong. I'm not a killer.

38:39.367 --> 38:42.248
And if you think I was worried about
my job because of those women,

38:42.248 --> 38:43.220
you don't know me.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.595
And you don't know Gordon Buchanan.

38:46.841 --> 38:49.937
Well, we know Brian Welton.

39:04.838 --> 39:08.937
- Mr. Buchanan?
- He already knows.

39:10.609 --> 39:17.134
It's a shame,
considering how far you've come.

39:25.906 --> 39:30.154
What did we find out about your father?

39:32.885 --> 39:37.430
He cleans fish on a trawler in San Pedro.

39:37.430 --> 39:39.249
It must've been nice,

39:39.249 --> 39:42.506
him comin'home smellin'of fish guts.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.772
That stench...

39:44.956 --> 39:47.330
It stuck to you, didn't it?

39:51.483 --> 39:55.191
Is that why they never
let you get too close?

39:57.794 --> 40:00.012
This idea...

40:00.012 --> 40:03.863
Did you come up with it when you
were sleeping with the wives...

40:03.863 --> 40:10.683
of the men who owned the boats
that ya scrubbed?

40:12.708 --> 40:16.094
They had it good, those women.

40:16.993 --> 40:20.125
They had someone to take care of them.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.919
Not you.

40:24.270 --> 40:26.947
You had nothing, no one.

40:26.947 --> 40:28.607
Even Eric,

40:28.607 --> 40:33.637
in his semi-vegetative state...

40:33.637 --> 40:37.622
His life was better than yours.
That's what you thought, didn't you?

40:37.622 --> 40:41.502
You needed an edge in life.

40:41.502 --> 40:46.413
So you came up with this.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.787
What did I do that was so bad?

40:52.787 --> 40:56.901
Eric wouldn't get hurt,
and Buchanan...

40:56.901 --> 41:00.396
I protected Buchanan.

41:00.824 --> 41:03.620
He took care of you,

41:04.808 --> 41:07.364
mentored you.

41:07.364 --> 41:08.927
But it cost you.

41:08.927 --> 41:12.800
I mean, I can only imagine, Brian,

41:12.800 --> 41:15.934
the stress that you felt.

41:16.298 --> 41:20.252
I mean, sitting there with
Buchanan and his friends...

41:20.252 --> 41:26.982
waiting for the accumulation of
inconsistencies to catch up with you.

41:26.982 --> 41:28.657
How long could you have gone on?

41:28.657 --> 41:31.499
Six months?
Three?

41:31.499 --> 41:33.693
I don't know.

41:33.693 --> 41:35.431
Well,

41:35.431 --> 41:37.488
that's over now.
That was the hard part.

41:37.488 --> 41:42.412
The easy part is admitting
what you did to Sherwood.

41:44.229 --> 41:45.732
I can't.

41:45.732 --> 41:48.075
You already have.

41:50.649 --> 41:53.795
You assumed the disk was in the safe?

41:53.795 --> 41:56.360
- Yes.
- Because?

41:56.360 --> 41:58.581
Because you searched
the whole room for the watch,

41:58.581 --> 42:02.065
and if there had been another disk,
you would've come across it,

42:02.065 --> 42:04.431
unless it was in the safe...

42:04.431 --> 42:06.298
the safe that you couldn't open.

42:06.298 --> 42:08.388
If you hadn't been in such a hurry
to kill Sherwood,

42:08.388 --> 42:11.274
he might've given you the combination.

42:11.274 --> 42:13.298
That disk...

42:13.298 --> 42:16.348
It had to be in the safe.

42:16.348 --> 42:20.561
Isn't that what you said, Brian?

42:24.232 --> 42:27.571
You wanna hear it on tape?

42:31.293 --> 42:33.057
He was blackmailing me.

42:33.057 --> 42:35.621
I wasn't hurting anyone.
Why should I go to jail?

42:35.621 --> 42:37.923
All the people he infected?
He was the bad guy. Mailer, Johannsen...

42:37.923 --> 42:40.554
They're the bad guys.!

42:40.554 --> 42:44.259
You cut a human being in half, Brian.

42:45.389 --> 42:48.408
How good does that make you?

43:07.984 --> 43:11.691
Bad news comes in all packages.

43:11.691 --> 43:16.088
Any bets which one the media
will anoint the lesser evil?

43:16.088 --> 43:17.920
There's no such animal.
