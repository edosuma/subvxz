BETTER MAKE IT A FAST ONE.
I NEED MY BEAUTY SLEEP

01:39.081 --> 01:41.015
COME ON, YOU NEEDED TO START
SLEEPING YEARS AGO

01:41.016 --> 01:43.017
IF YOU WERE GONNA
HAVE ANY SHOT AT BEING
BEAUTIFUL, DRAMA.

01:43.051 --> 01:44.752
WHY CAN'T YOU EVER
JUST BE SUPPORTIVE?

01:44.786 --> 01:47.288
- SORRY, I'M JUST BEING FUNNY.
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

01:47.322 --> 01:49.624
TOMORROW'S AUDITION
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
OF MY LIFE.

01:49.658 --> 01:51.526
- I APOLOGIZE.
- I DON'T ACCEPT IT.

01:51.593 --> 01:52.960
HE'S SAD JAMIE'S
LEAVING, JOHNNY.

01:52.995 --> 01:55.663
WHY ISN'T HE WITH HER
INSTEAD OF HERE ABUSING ME?

01:55.697 --> 01:57.999
'CAUSE SHE'S AT
A MEET AND GREET WITH
HER NEW CAST MATES

01:58.033 --> 02:00.835
- AND I'M GONNA GO
SLEEP THERE LATER.
- WELL, LA-DI-DA.

02:00.869 --> 02:03.538
THAT'S JAMIE,
SHE'S DONE EARLY.
I'M OUT.

02:03.639 --> 02:05.139
- SHUT UP.
- IT'S HER LAST NIGHT.

02:05.173 --> 02:07.808
- OKAY OKAY.
- NO TEARS, PUSSY.

02:07.843 --> 02:09.143
- LATER.
- LATER.

02:09.176 --> 02:11.145
HEY, JOHNNY, IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO, I UNDERSTAND.

02:11.179 --> 02:12.713
I CAN JUST ROLL WITH E.

02:12.748 --> 02:16.417
LOOKS LIKE HIS DANCE CARD
IS ALREADY FILLED, BRO.

02:16.451 --> 02:18.586
WOW, E MAKING OUT
IN PUBLIC.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.788
THAT'S SOMETHING I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D SEE.

02:20.822 --> 02:23.991
- I THINK I KNOW
THAT BROAD.
- YEAH?

02:24.026 --> 02:26.928
- YO, E, WT'S UP?
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

02:26.962 --> 02:29.697
- HEY, TARA.
- OH, HEY, JOHNNY.

02:29.731 --> 02:31.899
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW YOU DOING?

02:31.934 --> 02:34.035
- GOOD.
- YOU GUYS KNOW
EACH OTHER?

02:34.069 --> 02:37.838
- OH YEAH.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
EACH OTHER?

02:39.041 --> 02:41.075
- CALM DOWN, E.
- I CAN'T CALM DOWN.

02:41.076 --> 02:43.110
- WHEN WERE YOU WITH HER?
- WHEN WERE YOU?

02:43.111 --> 02:46.247
- LAST WEEK.
- HA, I BEAT YOU
BY FOUR MONTHS.

02:46.281 --> 02:49.550
- I'M SICK.
- E, I'VE HAD MOST
OF THIS TOWN.

02:49.585 --> 02:52.787
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN THAT
OUR TREES WOULD DABBLE IN THE
SAME FORT AT SOME POINT.

02:52.788 --> 02:55.089
I FIGURED IT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
VINCE AT SOME POINT, NOT YOU.

02:55.123 --> 02:57.258
- HEY, WE'RE STILL YOUNG.
- GOD, I'M NAUSEOUS.

02:57.292 --> 02:59.927
- NOW YOU'RE INSULTING ME, E.
- YEAH, AND LIGHTEN UP.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.796
FOUR MONTHS IS
A LONG TIME AGO.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.865
THIS GIRL WASN'T
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

03:03.899 --> 03:06.200
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE SHE'S REAL SLUTTY.

03:06.235 --> 03:08.436
LET'S ROLL.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.938
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE'S REAL SLUTTY?

03:10.973 --> 03:13.574
SHE MIGHT HAVE
GIVEN ME SOMETHING.

03:13.609 --> 03:15.910
- SHUT UP.
- I CAN'T BE SURE.

03:15.944 --> 03:18.079
I WAS ON A REAL HOT
STREAK WHEN IT HAPPENED,

03:18.113 --> 03:20.581
BUT SHE WAS
THE PRIME SUSPECT.

03:20.616 --> 03:23.484
- YOU JOKING?
- RELAX, E, YOU'LL BE FINE.

03:23.552 --> 03:26.654
- YEAH, YOU COVERED UP, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

03:26.722 --> 03:29.090
DID YOU?

03:29.124 --> 03:30.858
I SAID YEAH.

03:30.893 --> 03:33.160
YOU TWITCHED.

03:33.195 --> 03:35.062
THE CLASSIC
NO-CONDOM TELL.

03:36.331 --> 03:38.399
- YOU DIDN'T WEAR A BAG?
- I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.934
SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS ON THE PILL.

03:39.968 --> 03:41.369
OH, E.
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.770
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME
AND TAKE A SHOWER.

03:42.804 --> 03:44.939
I'D PICK UP SOME CLOROX
IF I WAS YOU.

03:44.973 --> 03:48.109
TOMORROW MORNING
I'M WAKING UP AND I'M CALLING
MY DOCTOR FIRST THING.

03:48.143 --> 03:51.312
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
NEED A LITTLE IRISH
LUCK TOMORROW.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.315
- GOOD MORNING, MR. GOLD.
- WHO ARE YOU?

03:54.316 --> 03:55.816
MATT WAHLBERG.
H.R. SENT ME UP.

03:55.817 --> 03:57.585
THEY SAID YOU WERE
UNHAPPY WITH YOUR ASSISTANT.

03:57.619 --> 04:00.254
I'VE BEEN UNHAPPY WITH
THE LAST THREE THEY SENT.

04:00.289 --> 04:03.324
I GOT YOU A BLUEBERRY
BRAN MUFFIN FROM THE
BELWOOD BAKERY.

04:03.358 --> 04:04.926

04:04.960 --> 04:06.827
IT IS.

04:06.862 --> 04:09.463
EXCEPT THIS IS CRANBERRY.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.899
- WHAT?
- SEE THE RED BERRIES?

04:11.934 --> 04:14.835
UM, I ASKED FOR BLUE.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.737
- DID YOU CHECK?
- NO.

04:16.772 --> 04:19.207
- BYE, MATT.
- SO BACK TO HUMAN RESOURCES?

04:19.241 --> 04:22.376
BACK TO THE IOWA FARMHOUSE
THAT BREASTFED YOU TILL 15.

04:22.411 --> 04:24.579
- RUNNING A LITTLE LATE, ARI?
- JESUS!

04:24.613 --> 04:26.681
TERRANCE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:26.715 --> 04:28.583
PERHAPS IT'S BUDGETARY CUTS.

04:28.617 --> 04:30.618
THERE WAS NO ONE
MINDING YOUR DESK.

04:30.652 --> 04:33.688
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE
SECURITY ESCORT YOU OUT
THE WAY YOURS DID ME.

04:33.722 --> 04:35.389
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THAT.

04:35.424 --> 04:36.858
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:36.892 --> 04:38.726
I HAVE SOME BUSINESS
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.061
AT YOUR AGE?

04:40.095 --> 04:41.929
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT CONCERNS?

04:41.964 --> 04:44.665
LIKE FINDING AN ASSISTED-
LIVING FACILITY?

04:44.700 --> 04:47.802
LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU, ARI, THIS PLACE--

04:47.836 --> 04:49.937
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.

04:49.972 --> 04:52.640
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW QUICKLY YOU'VE GOTTEN
BACK ON YOUR FEET.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.742
I'M MORE THAN BACK
ON MY FEET,

04:54.776 --> 04:56.344
I'M TOWERING OVER YOU.

04:56.378 --> 05:00.214
AH, ARI, STILL THE SAME
SNIPPY LITTLE BOY.

05:02.017 --> 05:04.652
TERRANCE, IF YOU HAVE
BUSINESS TO DISCUSS,

05:04.686 --> 05:08.289
START DISCUSSING,
'CAUSE I'M BUSY WITH
MY OWN BUSINESS.

05:08.323 --> 05:11.359
OBVIOUSLY I NEED THIS
TO BE DISCREET.

05:17.232 --> 05:19.200
YOUR STAR PUPIL
WHAT, YOWALKS OUT ON YOU--

05:19.234 --> 05:20.668
I WANT YOU TO BUY ME OUT.

05:22.170 --> 05:23.971
WHY WOULD I WANT TO?

05:24.006 --> 05:25.940
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S UP
TO YOU TO DECIDE.

05:25.974 --> 05:28.376
I'M PUTTING IT OUT
THERE TO YOU FIRST

05:28.410 --> 05:30.578
BEFORE I'M OFFERING IT
TO ANYONE ELSE.

05:30.612 --> 05:32.346
WELL, WHY AM I
SO FORTUNATE?

05:32.381 --> 05:35.216
I JUST WANT A SIMPLE DEAL,
MINIMUM HASSLES.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.752
NOW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE COULD GO THERE.

05:37.786 --> 05:40.321
IF NOT, THEN ALL RIGHT,
SO BE IT.

05:43.158 --> 05:45.793
WELL THEN, I'LL GO.

05:45.827 --> 05:48.396
HOW MUCH?

05:48.430 --> 05:51.365
- 100.
- ( laughs )
COME ON.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.769
I KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
INSIDE AND OUT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

05:54.803 --> 05:56.103
<i>I DON'T THINK IT IS.</i>

05:56.138 --> 05:58.706
OUR BACKEND ON "SEINFELD"
AND "FRIENDS" ALONE

05:58.740 --> 06:00.975
WILL KEEP YOU IN GREEN
FOR DECADES.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.878
- YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
- I JUST DID.

06:03.912 --> 06:06.914
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.950
CLUBBING BABY SEALS
SOMEWHERE?

06:08.984 --> 06:10.451
YOU'VE GOT 24 HOURS.

06:10.485 --> 06:13.454
24-- FUCK IT.
LLO--

06:15.257 --> 06:17.825
<i>I'M DOWNLOADING YOU THE NEW
EMPIRE OF THE SUN ALBUM.</i>

06:17.860 --> 06:19.927
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PICKING SONGS FOR YOU.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.796
I STARTED TO,
BUT I GAVE UP

06:21.830 --> 06:24.432
WHEN I CAME ACROSS YOUR
BOYZ II MEN COLLECTION.

06:24.466 --> 06:26.234
DRAMA MUST HAVE PUT
THAT ON MY COMPUTER.

06:26.268 --> 06:29.070
<i>- OH, YEAH YEAH.
- WHATEVER.  I DO HAVE
A SENSITIVE SIDE.</i>

06:29.104 --> 06:31.572
<i>- I KNOW.
- NOW LET'S GO.</i>

06:31.607 --> 06:34.308

06:36.278 --> 06:38.379
<i>AND LOBSTER MASH
FROM MASTRO'S.</i>

06:38.413 --> 06:41.215
INTERESTING COMBO
FOR 11:00 A.M.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.784
<i>- I WANTED IT TO BE SPECIAL.
- IT IS.</i>

06:45.220 --> 06:46.454
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

06:46.488 --> 06:48.589
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
IF YOU DON'T FINISH PACKING.

06:48.624 --> 06:50.758
SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T FEEL READY.

06:50.792 --> 06:54.462
WE HAVEN'T EVENTALKED ABOUTW
WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THIS.

06:54.496 --> 06:56.497
WE'RE GONNA TALK ON
THE PHONE 10 TIMES A DAY

06:56.532 --> 06:58.165
AND I'M GONNA COME VISIT.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.800
YOU THINK IT'S THAT EASY?

06:59.835 --> 07:02.169
I KNOW IT IS.

07:02.204 --> 07:05.339
NOW CAN WE PLEASE PUT
THE COMPUTER AWAY AND ENJOY
3500 CALORIES?

07:05.374 --> 07:08.042
YES.  ONE SEC.
I JUST WANT TO CHECK
IF MY FLIGHT'S ON TIME.

07:08.076 --> 07:10.278
<i>- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT'S THIS?</i>

07:10.312 --> 07:12.013
<i>WHAT?</i>

07:12.114 --> 07:14.815
IT SAYS YOU'VE GOT
A NEW FACEBOOK FRIEND.

07:14.850 --> 07:15.983
OH YEAH?

07:18.120 --> 07:20.121
THE GIRL FROM U.C.L.A.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.026
LET'S GET THOSE
BREWS ON ICE.

07:25.093 --> 07:28.162
LET'S GET
THOSE BREWS ON ICE.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.765
OH, YOU'VE GOT
NO SHOT, DRAMA.

07:30.799 --> 07:32.767
YO, FAUSTINO.
WHAT UP?

07:32.801 --> 07:34.869
NADA, JUST TESTING
ON A NEW PILOT.

07:34.937 --> 07:37.572
- ANNIHILATED IT.
- NICE NICE.

07:37.606 --> 07:39.340
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:39.374 --> 07:40.975
TESTING FOR
THE NEW "MELROSE."

07:41.009 --> 07:42.510
DIDN'T THEY THROW YOU
OFF THAT THING ONCE?

07:42.544 --> 07:45.112
YEAH WELL,
IT'S A NEW DAY.

07:45.147 --> 07:46.447
- BAD ASS.
- YEAH.

07:46.481 --> 07:48.349
- SO HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT IT?
- CONFIDENT.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.585
- I GOT THIS DOWN COLD.
- NICE.

07:50.619 --> 07:52.787
- JOHNNY.
- HEY, PHIL.

07:52.821 --> 07:54.989
- ROCK IT, MAN.
- LATER, BRO.

07:55.023 --> 07:56.290
- HEY, GUYS.
- YOU READY?

07:56.325 --> 07:58.226
YEAH, I'M READY.
YOU GUYS READY?

07:58.260 --> 08:00.461
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE JUST WAITING
FOR THE DIRECTOR.

08:00.495 --> 08:02.430
- COOL.
- THERE HE IS.

08:03.899 --> 08:06.968
- HE'S DIRECTING?
- YEAH, YOU KNOW HIM?

08:07.002 --> 08:10.738
- UH-HUH.
- GREAT. AWESOME.
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.076
<i>Doctor:
HOW MANY SEXUAL
PARTNERS HAVE YOU HAD?</i>

08:15.110 --> 08:17.645
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT
THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR.

08:17.679 --> 08:20.214
I STILL NEED TO GET A GENERAL
IDEA OF YOUR HISTORY.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.617
I DON'T KNOW,
THE NORMAL AMOUNT.

08:22.651 --> 08:25.253
MULTIPLE PARTNERS.
ANY GROUP SEX?

08:25.287 --> 08:27.755
- IS THIS REALLY RELEVANT?
- YES.

08:27.789 --> 08:31.459
UH, I HAD A THREESOME ONCE
WITH TWO GIRLS.

08:31.493 --> 08:35.429
- EVER GIVEN ANAL SEX?
- I TRIED ONCE.  NO.

08:35.464 --> 08:37.365
- EVER RECEIVED?
- NO.

08:37.399 --> 08:40.201
<i>- DO YOU USE PROTECTION?
- USUALLY.</i>

08:40.235 --> 08:42.770
NOT THIS TIME,
OBVIOUSLY.

08:42.804 --> 08:46.240
AND THIS PARTNER TOLD YOU

08:46.275 --> 08:48.075
THAT SHE MAY
HAVE SOMETHING?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.077
WELL, NO, BUT A FRIEND
OF MINE WHO WAS WITH HER

08:50.112 --> 08:51.679
THINKS SHE MAY HAVE
GIVEN HIM SOMETHING.

08:51.713 --> 08:53.381
- OH.
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

08:53.415 --> 08:56.784
WELL, WE'RE STILL GONNA
NEED TO GET A SWAB.

08:56.818 --> 08:58.452
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT THING?

08:58.487 --> 09:01.856
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE HOPING
I WON'T DO.

09:01.890 --> 09:04.492
BUT IF YOU'RE LEAVING
FOR FOUR MONTHS IT'S SILLY
FOR US TO GO OUT NOW.

09:04.526 --> 09:06.360
I'LL BE BACK.

09:06.395 --> 09:07.862
- LET'S GO.
- HOW WAS IT?

09:07.896 --> 09:09.664
I FEEL VIOLATED.

09:09.698 --> 09:12.166
I'LL CALL YOU.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.869
OF COURSE WE WANT IT,
IF WE CAN GET IT AT
THE RIGHT PRICE.

09:14.903 --> 09:16.771
BUT 100 SOUNDS
RIDICULOUS.

09:16.805 --> 09:18.639
IT'S BEYOND RIDICULOUS.
BUT IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF--

09:18.640 --> 09:20.541
WE'RE THE LARGEST
AGENCY IN THE WORLD.

09:20.576 --> 09:23.211
- MUSIC, PUBLISHING, SPORTS.
- IT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT.

09:23.245 --> 09:24.879
NOT FOR 100,
IT DOESN'T.

09:24.913 --> 09:26.747
THE QUESTION IS
WHAT'S HIS REAL PRICE?

09:26.782 --> 09:28.716
THE QUESTION IS WHY
IS HE COMING TO YOU FIRST?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.618
SAYS WE CAN MAKE
AN EASY DEAL.

09:30.652 --> 09:32.653
YOU TWO HATE EACH OTHER.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY EASY.

09:32.688 --> 09:34.689
- NO, IT DOESN'T.
- I WORKED FOR TERRANCE
FOR 14 YEARS.

09:34.723 --> 09:36.424
HE DOESN'T LIKE EASY.
HE LIKES A FIGHT.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.326
SO HE'S TRYING TO MAKE
ARI LOOK STUPID.

09:38.393 --> 09:40.094
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- NO, I DID.

09:40.128 --> 09:42.597
HE WON'T.
YOU JUST TELL ME
IF WE WANT THIS.

09:42.631 --> 09:45.099
NOT FOR 100, WE DON'T.

09:46.869 --> 09:49.003
HI, MR. GOLD.
I'M JAKE STEINBERG.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.738
H.R. SENT ME UP TO REPLACE
YOUR LAST ASSISTANT.

09:50.772 --> 09:52.940
I DON'T CARE.
GET ME EDDIE KAPOWSKI
ON THE PHONE.

09:52.975 --> 09:56.177
ANY RELATION TO KELLY KAPOWSKI?
YOU KNOW, "SAVED BY THE BELL"?

09:56.211 --> 09:58.512
YOU'RE FINISHED.
GO.

09:58.547 --> 10:01.082
YOU'RE FUCKING FIRED.

10:01.116 --> 10:03.818
- ( phone rings )
- KAPOWSKI HERE.

10:03.852 --> 10:05.453
<i>It's Ari.
I got a gig for you.</i>

10:05.487 --> 10:07.154
TALK TO ME.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.757
I NEED YOU TO FIND EVERY
PIECE OF CURRENT INFORMATION

10:09.791 --> 10:11.292
ON TERRANCE McQUIEWICK.

10:11.326 --> 10:12.960
SORRY, ARI.
NO CAN DO.

10:12.995 --> 10:15.763
- I'VE GOT A CONFLICT.
- WHAT KIND OF CONFLICT?

10:15.797 --> 10:18.132
<i>- Can't say.
- DOES IT INVOLVE ME?</i>

10:18.166 --> 10:19.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:19.635 --> 10:22.236
IS THAT SON OF A BITCH LOOKING
AT ME FOR SOME REASON?

10:22.237 --> 10:24.171
<i>Ari.</i>

10:24.206 --> 10:25.973
<i>- ARE YOU?
- Ari.</i>

10:26.008 --> 10:28.743
- WOULD YOU DO THAT?
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

10:28.777 --> 10:30.578
HOW WOULD I KNOW
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME?

10:30.612 --> 10:32.380
<i>You wouldn't.
But I'm not.</i>

10:32.414 --> 10:35.650
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- I'M NOT WHEREVER YOU ARE,
SO RELAX.

10:35.684 --> 10:38.719
EDDIE, I HAVE GIVEN YOU TONS
OF BUSINESS OVER THE YEARS.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.421
I WANT ONE ANSWER.

10:40.455 --> 10:43.558
HAS TERRANCE McQUIEWICK
HIRED YOU TO LOOK AT ME?

10:43.592 --> 10:45.593
NO, ARI.
TERRANCE HASN'T HIRED
ME TO DO ANYTHING.

10:45.627 --> 10:48.896
BUT THAT'S ALL
I CAN TELL YOU, ALL RIGHT?
I'M SORRY.

10:50.899 --> 10:53.467
- I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
- OH, YOU DO?

10:53.502 --> 10:56.070
IT WAS A HARMLESS
LITTLE CLICK OF THE MOUSE.

10:56.071 --> 10:58.606
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
REQUEST TO BE MY FRIEND?

10:58.640 --> 11:01.642
<i>- I DON'T ACCEPT THEM ALL.
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.</i>

11:01.677 --> 11:04.912
THIS IS REALLY
CONVENIENT TIMING THOUGH,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

11:04.947 --> 11:07.381
NO, IT'S TERRIBLE TIMING,
'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE ALL UPSET.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.650
SORRY FOR YOUR GUILT.

11:09.685 --> 11:11.819
JAMIE, PLEASE.
THIS IS HARD ENOUGH
ALREADY.

11:11.854 --> 11:13.754
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST TRUST ME
AND FORGET ABOUT IT?

11:13.789 --> 11:16.190
I KNOW I'M FORGETTING
SOMETHING.

11:16.225 --> 11:19.026
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.
I LOOKED UNDER THE BED,
I OPENED EVERY DRAWER.

11:19.061 --> 11:21.128
<i>I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU AND I ARE OKAY.</i>

11:21.129 --> 11:23.664
- THEN DELETE HER.
- DELETE HER?

11:23.699 --> 11:26.267
YEAH, TAKE HER OFF
YOUR FRIENDS LIST.

11:30.672 --> 11:33.507
DONE.
FEEL BETTER?

11:33.542 --> 11:35.009
NOT REALLY.

11:35.043 --> 11:37.411
- JAMIE, COME ON.
- DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

11:37.446 --> 11:38.946
<i>NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.</i>

11:38.981 --> 11:41.382
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

11:41.416 --> 11:43.484
IT'S GONNA BE
AMAZING FOR YOU.

11:46.788 --> 11:48.389
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

11:48.423 --> 11:50.725
BABY, NO.
DON'T CRY.

11:50.759 --> 11:53.494
I'LL BE WAITING RIGHT HERE
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.568
<i>Lloyd:
Johnny, you're making
yourself crazy.</i>

12:00.602 --> 12:02.837
NO, THEY'RE MAKING ME CRAZY.
THIS WAS A SETUP.

12:02.871 --> 12:05.306
- NO, IT WASN'T.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

12:05.307 --> 12:08.676
WHY DIDN'T YOU PREPARE ME?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I HAD
A CONFLICT WITH THE DIRECTOR?

12:08.710 --> 12:11.012
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF ALL
YOUR CONFLICTS, JOHNNY.

12:11.046 --> 12:14.048
<i>- THIS GUY'S AN ANIMAL.
- Charm him with your
winning smile.</i>

12:14.082 --> 12:16.417
MR. CHASE,
THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

12:16.451 --> 12:18.286
GREAT, THEY'RE READY.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.354
JOHNNY DRAMA,
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

12:20.355 --> 12:24.759
NOW STEP UP AND SHINE BRIGHT
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

12:24.793 --> 12:26.194
I GOT TO GO.

12:26.228 --> 12:27.828
BREAK A LEG.

12:27.863 --> 12:31.299
- JOHNNY CHASE, EVERYONE.
- OKAY.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.935
- HEY, EVERYONE.
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, JOHNNY.

12:33.969 --> 12:36.337
<i>- TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
WITH THE CAMERA.
- THAT'S OKAY.</i>

12:36.371 --> 12:38.472
JUST AS LONG AS YOU
WEREN'T FREEZING ME OUT

12:38.507 --> 12:40.208
'CAUSE THIS GUY IS
STILL MAD AT ME.

12:40.242 --> 12:41.642
WHY WOULD HE BE
MAD AT YOU?

12:41.677 --> 12:43.678
LAST TIME JOHN AUDITIONED
FOR ME ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

12:43.712 --> 12:45.580
KEPT CHECKING HIS EMAIL.
JOHN GOT A LITTLE UPSET.

12:45.614 --> 12:48.816
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY NOW.
YOU CAN TALK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY AUDITION.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.786
YOU CAN SCREAM AND YELL--
WHATEVER. NOTHING FAZES
ME ANYMORE.

12:51.820 --> 12:54.222
THAT'S GOOD, JOHNNY,
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT
TO TRY AND FAZE YOU.

12:54.256 --> 12:56.891
JUST RELAX.
EVERYBODY HERE IS HOPING
THAT YOU'RE THE GUY.

12:56.925 --> 12:59.493
IN FACT, I'M GONNA TURN
THIS OFF RIGHT NOW

12:59.528 --> 13:01.162
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISTRACT YOU, OKAY?

13:01.196 --> 13:04.498
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
LET'S DO THIS.

13:09.238 --> 13:11.172
( clears throat )

13:11.206 --> 13:12.707
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

13:12.741 --> 13:15.910
TWO SECONDS.
( exhales )

13:15.944 --> 13:17.345
HERE WE GO.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.680
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
LET'S DO THIS.  OH!

13:19.715 --> 13:22.817
I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I'M HERE EARLY.
NOBODY WAS--

13:22.851 --> 13:25.520
THAT'S OKAY, DEAN.
WE'RE JUST RUNNING
A LITTLE BEHIND.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.756
<i>- WE'LL BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
- I'LL JUST WAIT OUTSIDE.</i>

13:28.790 --> 13:31.692
- HEY, DRAMA.
- DEAN.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.362
<i>GOOD LUCK, MAN.
SORRY.</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:37.164
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
- HE'S TESTING TOO?

13:37.199 --> 13:40.535
<i>- I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT DEAN, JOHN.</i>

13:40.569 --> 13:43.738
- FUCKING SUPERMAN.
- HEY, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

13:43.805 --> 13:45.373
IT'S YOUR JOB TO LOSE.

13:49.545 --> 13:51.379
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

13:51.413 --> 13:55.049
GOD, I HAVEN'T AUDITIONED
IN LIKE THREE YEARS.

13:57.686 --> 14:00.154
( breathing heavily )

14:04.026 --> 14:06.460
DO YOU GUYS MIND IF I
JUST STEP OUT FOR A SECOND?

14:06.495 --> 14:08.563
WE'RE KIND OF ON
A TIGHT SCHEDULE.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.265
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- HEY, JOHN.

14:12.868 --> 14:14.569
- THAT'S A MELTDOWN.
- UH-HUH.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.571
COME ON, JOHNNY, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET BACK IN THERE.

14:16.605 --> 14:20.007
BRO, I CAN'T.
I THINK I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

14:20.042 --> 14:23.678
JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK.

14:23.712 --> 14:27.048
I'VE HAD 100 PANIC ATTACKS
IN MY LIFE, THIS ISN'T
A PANIC ATTACK.

14:27.082 --> 14:29.217
<i>- JOHNNY.. - Vince.</i>

14:29.251 --> 14:32.720
<i>- Yes, Johnny?
- I THINK I PEED MYSELF.</i>

14:32.754 --> 14:34.889
UH...

14:34.923 --> 14:37.625
OKAY, JOHNNY,
I'M COMING TO GET YOU.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.828
HURRY, BRO.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.797
I'VE GOT TO GO.

14:44.132 --> 14:45.933
SOMEONE'S RUNNING BEHIND.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.102
- YEAH, I HAD
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:48.136 --> 14:50.171
- IT WAS A LAST MINUTE THING.
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:50.205 --> 14:53.040
YEAH YEAH.
BUT IF HE CALLS, JUST PUT
IT RIGHT THROUGH, PLEASE.

14:53.075 --> 14:55.776
SURE.  HERE ARE
YOUR OTHER MESSAGES.
ALSO, MY FRIEND RICKY CALLED.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.745
HATE TO GET INVOLVED, BUT I
THINK SHE KIND OF LIKES YOU.

14:57.779 --> 15:01.082
- OH, COOL.
- SO SHOULD I TELL HER
YOU'LL CALL HER?

15:01.116 --> 15:03.651
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE TAKING
A BREAK FROM THE DATING
POOL FOR A WHILE.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.687
- MURPHY GROUP, HEY.
- WHAT'S UP, SCOTT?

15:06.722 --> 15:09.023
WHAT'S UP, MAMA?
SO I HEARD YOU HAD

15:09.057 --> 15:10.491
A WILD PARTY NIGHT
AT VILLA.

15:10.526 --> 15:12.927
OH YEAH?
HOW'D YOU HEAR THAT?

15:12.961 --> 15:14.996
WELL, THE GIRL THAT YOU WERE
SUCKING FACE WITH, TARA,

15:15.097 --> 15:17.832
I KNOW HER--
WELL, SOME FRIENDS OF MINE
ACTUALLY KNOW HER...

15:17.866 --> 15:20.468
- WELL.
- I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

15:22.037 --> 15:23.671
- SCOTT.
- YEAH?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.375
WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS
KNOW ABOUT HER?

15:27.409 --> 15:30.111
UH, SHE'S NOT LIKE YOUR
GIRLFRIEND OR ANYTHING?

15:30.145 --> 15:32.046
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GIRL.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.215
- WELL, YOU KNOW HER
A LITTLE BIT.
- WHAT DO I KNOW?

15:34.249 --> 15:36.384
- I DON'T KNOW.
THE SAME THING I KNOW.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

15:36.451 --> 15:39.187
THAT SHE KEEPS IT MOVING.
SHE GETS AROUND.

15:39.221 --> 15:41.455
SHE GETS AROUND?
SCOTT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HAVE YOU BEEN WITH HER?

15:41.490 --> 15:43.491
NO, NOT MY STYLE.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.793
- THE GIRL'S LIKE A PETRI DISH.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

15:45.827 --> 15:48.896
I KNOW THAT CLIFF CANTOR
AND RICK SALOMON DOUBLE
TEAMED HER

15:48.897 --> 15:51.899
AT A PARTY A COUPLE
WEEKS AGO, WHICH IS NOT
EXCELLENT FOR YOU.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.135
- JESUS.
- OH HEY, LISTEN.

15:54.169 --> 15:57.138
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU LIKE HER,
YOU CAN CHANGE HER.

15:57.172 --> 15:59.240
<i>A NICE BOY LIKE YOU CAN
REFORM A GIRL LIKE THAT.</i>

15:59.308 --> 16:01.542
- YOU GOT TO GET
THE DOCTOR ON THE PHONE.
- VINCE JUST CALLED.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.644
- HE'S ON HIS WAY TO
THE HOSPITAL WITH DRAMA.
- WHY?

16:03.679 --> 16:05.479
HE THINKS DRAMA
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.348
- OH MY GOD.
- THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO CEDARS.

16:07.382 --> 16:10.184
TEXT ME WHERE I'M GOING.

16:11.453 --> 16:13.487
<i>¶ I'VE BEEN UP
AND ON MY FEET ¶</i>

16:13.522 --> 16:15.690
<i>¶ SINCE THE BREAK OF DAY ¶</i>

16:15.724 --> 16:18.526
<i>¶ YOU'VE BEEN DOWN THE ROAD
THERE, BABY... ¶</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:20.461
( barking )

16:22.030 --> 16:25.266
MELINDA.
MY LOVE, HOW ARE YOU?

16:25.300 --> 16:28.302
ARI GOLD, LONG TIME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:28.337 --> 16:30.905
I HAVE A MEETING.
TV STUFF, BORING.
FUNNY RUNNING INTO YOU.

16:30.939 --> 16:32.974
- I JUST SAW YOUR HUSBAND.
- REALLY?

16:33.008 --> 16:36.844
YEAH, STILL NOT LOOKING
QUITE ALIVE ENOUGH TO
HAVE GOTTEN YOU.

16:36.879 --> 16:38.746
UH-HUH.  HOW WAS
YOUR LITTLE REUNION?

16:38.780 --> 16:40.715
- THERE'S STILL SOME
BITTERNESS THERE.
- I BET.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.151
YEAH.  SO HAS HE SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT LATELY?

16:44.186 --> 16:46.721
- ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT?
- ANYTHING ABOUT OUR
BITTERNESS?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.757
UH, NO, ARI.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
YOU VERY OFTEN.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.192
OH, COME ON, MELINDA.

16:51.226 --> 16:53.694
YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT
ME VERY OFTEN BEFORE
YOU MET TERRANCE.

16:53.729 --> 16:55.363
- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT?

16:55.397 --> 16:57.131
DID YOU COME HERE
FOR A REASON?

16:57.165 --> 16:59.100
- YES I DID.
- THEN SPEAK.

16:59.134 --> 17:02.103
TERRANCE CAME
TO ME THIS MORNING,
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

17:02.137 --> 17:04.672
BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE
FOR ME TO BUY HIM OUT.

17:04.705 --> 17:06.374
I DIDN'T KNOW.

17:06.407 --> 17:08.709
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
BUT I KNOW YOU KNOW.

17:08.743 --> 17:11.345
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, ARI.

17:11.380 --> 17:14.415
MELINDA, COME ON.
WE HAD A MOMENT
OF FLIRTATION.

17:14.449 --> 17:17.451
I'M SORRY IF YOU'RE
BITTER ALSO BECAUSE I
CHOSE MY WIFE OVER YOU.

17:17.519 --> 17:20.887
BUT I REPRESENTED YOUR TALENPRE.

17:20.923 --> 17:22.757
REVISIONIST HISTORY, ARI.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.425
YOU CHOSE YOUR WIFE
OVER ME 'CAUSE YOU
COULDN'T GET ME.

17:25.460 --> 17:28.329
AND YOU REPRESENTED ME
OVER HER 'CAUSE I HAD
MORE TALENT.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.799
LINE UP OUR RESUMES,
I THINK MOST WOULD AGREE.

17:31.867 --> 17:35.803
MELINDA, I KNOW HOW MUCH
TERRANCE TRUSTS YOU.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.239
NOW IF YOU GUYS WANT OUT,
I'IN.

17:38.273 --> 17:41.042
BUT I GOT YOU YOUR FIRST JOB,
SO DON'T LET ME BE PLAYED.

17:41.076 --> 17:43.711
HONEY, YOU KNOW
YOU NEVER GET PLAYED.

17:43.745 --> 17:45.846
AND ALL I'LL TELL YOU
IS THIS--

17:45.881 --> 17:47.849
<i>I'M NO LONGER ON THE INSIDE.</i>

17:47.883 --> 17:50.184
LOOK UP A 25-YEAR-OLD
D-CUP NAMED KELSEY.

17:50.252 --> 17:52.687
- MAYBE SHE CAN HELP.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:52.688 --> 17:55.857
I MEAN MY HUSBAND
IS A LYING SCUMBAG

17:55.891 --> 17:58.492
AND I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS TRYING TO SELL

17:58.560 --> 18:00.528
UNTIL RIGHT NOW.

18:01.797 --> 18:04.165
SO YOU HIRED
EDDIE KAPOWSKI?

18:04.199 --> 18:06.834
I'M LATE FOR MY
POLE DANCING CLASS, ARI.

18:11.406 --> 18:13.808
GUESS I'M REALLY GOING.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.110
YEAH.

18:16.144 --> 18:19.347
YOU'RE SO STRONG.
NO TEARS AT ALL.

18:19.381 --> 18:21.782
I'M A GUY.
WE DON'T CRY.

18:21.817 --> 18:24.519
NOT EVEN ON REALLY SAD
OCCASIONS?

18:24.553 --> 18:26.654
I'M CRYING ON THE INSIDE.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.596
TURTLE, I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT ABOUT

18:35.631 --> 18:39.433
THIS WHOLE SEPARATION
AND THE FACEBOOK THING.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.269
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
SINCE LUNCH?

18:41.303 --> 18:43.871
I GUESS BEFORE THAT TOO.

18:43.906 --> 18:47.041
IT'S WHY I GOT
SO UPSET.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.310
I MADE THIS DECISION
TO LEAVE

18:49.344 --> 18:51.846
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF ME.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.514
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.950
IF YOU WANT TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE WHILE
I'M GONE, I UNDERSTAND.

18:55.984 --> 18:59.153
- I DON'T WANT
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.
- YOU SAY THAT NOW.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.123
- JAMIE.
- TURTLE, I SWEAR THIS
IS NOT A PUNISHMENT.

19:03.492 --> 19:05.193
I JUST THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.794
YOU DROP THIS ON ME
WHILE WE'RE AT THE AIRPORT?

19:06.828 --> 19:09.864
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T WANT
YOU TO END UP HATING ME.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.400
JAMIE, I COULD
NEVER HATE YOU.

19:14.436 --> 19:17.271
- I'VE GOT TO GO.
- JAMIE.

19:17.306 --> 19:20.007
IS THIS 'CAUSE
I DIDN'T CRY?

19:20.042 --> 19:22.076
NO.

19:29.818 --> 19:32.220
THIS IS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

19:45.801 --> 19:48.369
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE
I'M GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE--

19:48.403 --> 19:49.871
WHAT I EAT, WHAT I DRINK.

19:49.905 --> 19:52.073
WHO YOU BANG.
I KNOW I'M GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.775
- LET'S HOPE I C  STILL BAN.
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.811
DRAMA, WHAT DID TARA GIVE YOU?
YOU NEVER SAID.

19:56.845 --> 19:58.913
I'M DYING OVER HERE
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

19:58.947 --> 20:01.182
SORRY.

20:02.684 --> 20:05.253
- DO YOU ITCH AT ALL?
- NO.

20:07.823 --> 20:10.057
- HELLO, JOHN.
- HEY, DOC.

20:10.092 --> 20:12.860
HOW AM I LOOKING?
AM I EVER GONNA GET
OUT OF HERE?

20:12.895 --> 20:15.229
- YOU ARE FREE TO GO.
- THANK GOD.

20:15.264 --> 20:18.533
- IT WAS JUST A PANIC ATTACK?
- NO, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
SERIOUS THAN THAT.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.468
- I TOLD YOU.
- SO WHAT IS IT?

20:20.502 --> 20:22.470
TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY.

20:22.504 --> 20:24.906
ITS SYMPTOMS MIMIC
A HEART ATTACK

20:24.940 --> 20:27.308
BUT ARE BROUGHT ON BY
REAL-LIFE EMOTIONAL STRESS.

20:27.342 --> 20:30.011
- YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT?
- TONS.

20:30.045 --> 20:33.314
IT'S OFTEN MISDIAGNOSED.
FORTUNATELY IN HOLLYWOOD,
WE SEE IT A LOT.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.750
THOUGH NINE TIMES OUT OF 10
IT'S SEEN IN WOMEN.

20:35.784 --> 20:37.785
- IN WOMEN?
- SO WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO?

20:37.819 --> 20:40.688
RELAX.  I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
SOME MEDICATION TO HELP.

20:40.722 --> 20:43.591
THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE COULD
BRING ON A REAL HEART ATTACK.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.626
FORTUNATELY THIS TIME
IT DIDN'T.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.595
- THANKS, DOC.
- TAKE CARE, GUYS.

20:47.629 --> 20:49.764
OH, LOVED "GATSBY," VINCE.

20:49.798 --> 20:51.666
<i>- THANKS.
- THANKS, DOC.</i>

20:51.700 --> 20:54.202
SEE, JOHNNY?
YOU'RE ALL GOOD.

20:54.236 --> 20:55.903
I'M NOT ALL GOOD
AT ALL, BRO.

20:55.938 --> 20:57.438
LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE
TO MYSELF.

20:57.472 --> 20:58.839
YOU HAD A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.

20:58.874 --> 21:00.875
WE'LL MAKE A COUPLE CALLS.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

21:00.876 --> 21:03.411
- ( phone rings )
- GREAT, IT'S MY DOCTOR.

21:03.445 --> 21:05.179
WELL, ANSWER IT.
YOU'LL BE FINE TOO.

21:05.214 --> 21:07.481
HELLO.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.250
SPEAKING.

21:09.284 --> 21:11.285
OKAY.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.154
<i>YEAH.</i>

21:13.188 --> 21:16.290
OKAY.
BYE.

21:16.325 --> 21:18.526
- WELL?
- THEY DON'T GIVE
RESULTS OVER THE PHONE.

21:18.594 --> 21:20.828
- I'VE GOT TO GO
IN TO THE OFFICE.
- WANT ME TO ROLL WITH?

21:20.863 --> 21:23.831
I'M FINE.
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.200
I'VE GOT TO CALL LLOYD.

21:26.268 --> 21:29.303
WE HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL
FOR TODAY, JOHNNY DRAMA.

21:29.338 --> 21:31.439
- OH YEAH, WHAT?
- I SPOKE TO PHIL YAGOTA.

21:31.473 --> 21:33.207
<i>- Yeah?
- AND HE'S GONNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.</i>

21:33.242 --> 21:35.610
REALLY?
THEY'RE GONNA SEE ME AGAIN.

21:35.644 --> 21:36.911
- THAT'S GREAT.
- HOW?

21:36.945 --> 21:38.646
I'M A MIRACLE WORKER.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.682
YOU MAY NEED A NOTE
FROM YOUR DOCTOR THAT SAYS
THIS WAS IN FACT REAL.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.086
WAS IT REAL?
AND TWO, YOU MAY NEED
TO PASS A PHYSICAL.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.523
BUT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,
JOHNNY DRAMA, BOTH LITERALLY
AND FIGURATIVELY.

21:50.092 --> 21:52.159
LOOK, TELL HIM I SAID
THANKS BUT NO THANKS.

21:52.194 --> 21:54.795
WHAT WHAT WHAT?

21:54.830 --> 21:56.831

I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE
TODAY, AND FOR WHAT?

21:56.865 --> 21:58.799
"MELROSE PLACE
THE NEXT GENERATION"?

21:58.834 --> 22:02.436
JOHNNY, YOU GOT OUT OF
YOUR "FIVE TOWNS" CONTRACT
FOR THIS.

22:02.437 --> 22:04.505
YEAH WELL, MAYBE IT
WAS MEANT TO BE.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.607
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
AND REASSESS.

22:06.642 --> 22:09.277
<i>- REASSESS WHAT?
- My life.</i>

22:09.344 --> 22:11.679
I STRONGLY ADVISE
AGAINST THIS, JOHNNY.

22:11.713 --> 22:15.016
YOU TAKE ANOTHER BREAK
FROM THE SPOTLIGHT, YOU COULD
VERY WELL BE GONE FOR GOOD.

22:15.050 --> 22:16.851
I HAD A REAL WAKE-UP
CALL TODAY, LLOYD.

22:16.885 --> 22:19.053
<i>- Johnny...
- I'LL BE IN TOUCH.</i>

22:20.956 --> 22:23.391
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

22:23.425 --> 22:25.760
NO.

22:25.794 --> 22:28.095
BUT FOR NOW
IT FEELS RIGHT.

22:28.130 --> 22:30.731
SICK, TWISTED,
DEMENTED ACTORS.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.233
WHY DID I EVER GET
INTO THIS BUSINESS?

22:32.267 --> 22:34.635
- LLOYD, LLOYD.
- WHAT? WHAT?

22:34.670 --> 22:36.571
ARI GOLD IS HEADING
UP THE ELEVATOR.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.606
OH GOOD GOD!

22:39.741 --> 22:41.375
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

22:41.410 --> 22:43.811
<i>¶ IT'S ME, BITCHES... ¶</i>

22:47.349 --> 22:48.883
- ARI?
- WHERE'S TERRANCE?

22:48.917 --> 22:51.285
CONFERENCE ROOM.

22:53.055 --> 22:56.090
<i>Terrance:
...WHERE WE'VE REALLY
FALLEN BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL</i>

22:56.124 --> 22:57.658
IS IN REALITY--

22:57.693 --> 22:59.994
I'M SORRY,
ARE YOU GUYS BUSY?

23:00.028 --> 23:02.129
WHAT IS THIS, ARI?

23:04.366 --> 23:06.033
AND I WANTED TO AN UNANNOUNCED
RETURN THE FAVOR.

23:06.068 --> 23:09.070
- THIS IS NOT VERY DISCREET.
- I HATE DISCRETION.

23:09.104 --> 23:11.973
I WANT TO PUT
MY CARDS ON THE TABLE.
ANYONE WANT TO SEE THEM?

23:12.007 --> 23:15.176
EVERYONE, GET OUT.
QUICKLY.

23:21.717 --> 23:24.452
- SO YOU'VE RECONSIDERED?
- I HAVE.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.655
- BUT NOT FOR 100.
- DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER?

23:27.689 --> 23:29.657
I DO.

23:37.065 --> 23:40.535
- WHAT'S THIS?
- IT'S A VAGINA.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

23:40.536 --> 23:42.503
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

23:42.538 --> 23:45.406
IT MEANS THAT I'M AMAZED
THAT IT'S TAKEN YOU THIS LONG,

23:45.440 --> 23:49.377
BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE
LET A VAGINA GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE.

23:49.378 --> 23:51.212
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ARI?

23:51.213 --> 23:54.315
I THINK YOU KNOW.
YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER

23:54.349 --> 23:57.218
WITHOUT SAYING TOO MUCH.
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
SO GOOD TOGETHER.

23:57.219 --> 24:00.621
BUT YOU FUCKED ME
AND NOW YOU'VE FUCKED
SOMEONE ELSE.

24:00.656 --> 24:01.956
AND NOW I'M GONNA
FUCK YOU.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.691
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK YOU KNOW.

24:03.725 --> 24:05.793
WELL, I KNOW YOU
GOT BUSTED AGAIN.

24:05.827 --> 24:09.197
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO SELL THIS COMPANY IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN UGLY DIVORCE.

24:09.231 --> 24:11.699
ESPECIALLY WITH MELINDA.
SHE'S TOUGH.

24:11.733 --> 24:14.268
MELINDA AND I ARE GREAT,
THANK YOU.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.237
HOW ARE YOU AND KELSEY?

24:16.271 --> 24:19.874
THAT STUPID BITCH
TOLD YOU?

24:19.908 --> 24:22.710
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A FUCKING PRENUP?

24:22.711 --> 24:25.947
- OH, YOU HAVE ONE?
- I'D KILL MY WIFE BEFORE
I GOT A DIVORCE.

24:25.981 --> 24:29.217
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING:
THIS IS MY FIRST MARRIAGE,
NOT MY FOURTH.

24:29.251 --> 24:32.086
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU
WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

24:32.087 --> 24:34.755
NOW IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LOWBALL ME, NO.

24:34.790 --> 24:38.226
EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
IS GONNA LOWBALL YOU ONCE THEY
FIND OUT YOU'RE DESPERATE.

24:38.260 --> 24:41.629
I'M NOT DESPERATE.
I JUST DON'T WANT A BATTLE.

24:41.663 --> 24:43.698
- 65.
- 85.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.000
THAT'S MY DROP DEAD NUMBER.
NOT A DOLLAR LESS.

24:46.034 --> 24:47.802
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

24:47.836 --> 24:49.704
<i>OTHERWISE I'LL OPEN
IT UP TO BIDDING.</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:51.672
AND YOU'LL OPEN YOURSELF
UP TO HUMILIATION.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.674
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE

24:53.709 --> 24:56.878
WHEN NIKKI FINKE STARTS
FLASHING PICTURES OF YOU
TRYING TO GET YOUR DICK HARD?

24:56.912 --> 25:00.715
I'LL FUCK NIKKI FINKE
BEFORE I LET HER AFFECT
MY BUSINESS DECISIONS.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.084
- 85, ARI.
- I'LL GIVE YOU 75.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.753
PROVIDED THAT AFTER
I DO MY DUE DILIGENCE,

25:05.787 --> 25:08.189
I DON'T FIND OUT THAT
YOU SCREWED UP EVERYTHING
I DID HERE.

25:08.223 --> 25:10.591
<i>YES OR NO?</i>

25:10.626 --> 25:13.694
HAVE THE PAPERS DRAWN UP.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.696
CIAO.

25:19.568 --> 25:21.802
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

25:21.837 --> 25:24.772
HEY, LLOYD.
IF YOU'RE HIDING SOMEWHERE,

25:24.806 --> 25:28.442
GO DEEPER BECAUSE I WILL
FIND YOU SOON ENOUGH.

25:41.924 --> 25:44.292
( sobbing )

25:49.565 --> 25:52.533
- MR. MURPHY.
- YEAH.

25:58.173 --> 26:00.308
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

26:00.342 --> 26:03.744
THE WORLD'S A CRAZY PLACE.
YOU GOT TO SEARCH FOR
WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.414
- WOULD YOU GET OFF ME?
- SORRY.

26:06.448 --> 26:09.250
SHE'S JUST FREAKED IS ALL.
GIVE HER SOME TIME
TO SETTLE IN.

26:09.284 --> 26:11.385
<i>- SHE'LL CALL.
- YO.</i>

26:11.420 --> 26:14.088
YO, ITCHY.
WHAT'S UP?

26:14.122 --> 26:16.924
UNLIKE YOU, DRAMA,
I STILL HAVE A DISEASE-
FREE TRACK RECORD.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.659
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, E.

26:18.694 --> 26:19.994
STILL NOT REALLY WHAT
I WOULD CALL A GOOD DAY.

26:20.062 --> 26:22.230
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
THE WORST DAY?

26:22.264 --> 26:24.432
- JAMIE BROKE IT OFF.
- WHAT?

26:24.466 --> 26:27.268
SHE DIDN'T BREAK IT OFF.
SHE TOLD ME TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE.

26:27.302 --> 26:30.404
- I SAY YOU EMBRACE IT.
- DON'T DO IT, TURTLE.

26:30.439 --> 26:31.839
LOS ANGELES IS A CESSPOOL.

26:31.874 --> 26:34.041
I SCREWED UP.
I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

26:34.076 --> 26:36.777
- SHE WAS TESTING
ME AND I FAILED.
- DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.479
NO, REALLY.
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HER.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.214
ALL DAY LONG SHE WAS SAYING
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

26:40.282 --> 26:42.283
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE.

26:42.317 --> 26:43.918
NOW YOU GOT TO START
THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

26:43.952 --> 26:47.355
I HAVE NO SELF.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
I AM WITHOUT JAMIE.

26:47.389 --> 26:48.956
I'M GONNA PUKE.

26:48.991 --> 26:51.292
OKAY, WE NEED TO GO
OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.

26:51.326 --> 26:53.227
FIND SOME NICE CLEAN GIRLS.

26:53.228 --> 26:55.696
- NOT ME, I'M DONE.
- E'S GONE CELIBATE.

26:55.731 --> 26:58.332
- NO, I'M GONNA GET SLOAN BACK.
- E, YOU HAD A LITTLE SCARE.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.068
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
I HATE DATING.

27:01.103 --> 27:03.938
I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SLOAN.

27:03.972 --> 27:05.339
E, SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.141
WELL, TOUGH SHIT.
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE ME.

27:07.175 --> 27:08.843
- ( laughs )
- ( phone chimes )

27:08.877 --> 27:11.412
U.C.L.A. GIRL WANTS TO KNOW
WHY WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE.

27:11.446 --> 27:13.314
- YOU GONNA CALL HER?
- NOPE.

27:13.348 --> 27:15.416
- CALLING JAMIE.
- SHE JUST LEFT.

27:15.450 --> 27:17.084
I'LL LEAVE HER A MESSAGE.
