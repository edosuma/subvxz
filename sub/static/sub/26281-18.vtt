<i>I tried to help you,
and you pushed me away.</i>

00:05.826 --> 00:09.247
It can't just be about
having fun together.

00:10.335 --> 00:11.702
If I have to call security,

00:11.704 --> 00:14.505
you understand that
I'm also gonna have to fire you.

00:15.707 --> 00:19.543
I am a surgeon!

00:19.545 --> 00:22.546
I am... I am a surgeon!

00:22.548 --> 00:26.183
I am a surgeon, Dr. Han!

00:32.357 --> 00:34.691
Why are you sad?

00:34.693 --> 00:36.794
I'm not sad.

00:36.796 --> 00:38.295
Is there another reason to get drunk

00:38.297 --> 00:39.463
at 10:00 in the morning?

00:39.465 --> 00:41.064
Shut up.

00:51.776 --> 00:54.378
It's fun to drink
with someone who is fun.

00:54.380 --> 00:56.331
Lea is fun. You're not fun.

01:04.756 --> 01:05.956
Shut up.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.831
No.

01:17.635 --> 01:20.704
If I have something to say,

01:20.706 --> 01:22.691
I will say it.

01:23.509 --> 01:25.175
Well, if I have someone to shut up,

01:25.177 --> 01:26.610
then I'll shut them up.

01:29.447 --> 01:32.367
If I have something to s...

01:33.185 --> 01:35.552
Okay, I do not like to be touched.

01:37.857 --> 01:39.490
Just shut up.

01:46.499 --> 01:49.366
I am a surgeon.

02:20.799 --> 02:22.299
You've had sex with each other.

02:23.735 --> 02:24.902
Yes.

02:24.904 --> 02:27.237
And you're planning on doing so again?

02:27.239 --> 02:29.633
- Yes.
- Good news.

02:30.175 --> 02:32.843
Because neither of you are
in a subservient position

02:32.845 --> 02:34.745
- to the other...
- Well, sometimes.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.550
You work together and
you are sleeping together.

02:39.552 --> 02:42.185
You don't see any way that can go wrong?

02:42.187 --> 02:44.888
Nothing for your employer to worry about?

02:46.324 --> 02:49.359
I'm going to interview
each of you separately

02:49.361 --> 02:52.229
to ensure that
the relationship is consensual.

02:53.364 --> 02:55.265
Zack Cordell, 31, loss of consciousness,

02:55.267 --> 02:56.767
laceration with closed head injury,

02:56.769 --> 02:57.968
possible brain contusion.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.937
- GCS score?
- Nine. Dr. Murphy thinks

02:59.939 --> 03:01.705
it might be an epidural hematoma.

03:01.707 --> 03:03.907
- Dr. Murphy?
- Yeah, he's...

03:05.043 --> 03:06.176
Where'd he go?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.339
Shaun?

03:09.915 --> 03:11.248
Come in.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.883
Tell us what you saw, what you did.

03:14.085 --> 03:15.319
I can't.

03:17.121 --> 03:19.523
I'm not a doctor here.

03:19.525 --> 03:22.225
You're still a doctor, Shaun.

03:24.462 --> 03:26.129
We need to know what happened.

03:30.521 --> 03:32.522
I found him like that.

03:36.574 --> 03:37.774
I want a STAT head CT.

03:37.776 --> 03:40.377
Get me a CBC and a tox screen.

03:40.379 --> 03:42.679
It might be an epidural hematoma.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.047
We heard.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.616
Let's get a bolt ICP monitor ready.

03:45.618 --> 03:47.217
- I'm on it.
- Dr. Lim...

03:47.219 --> 03:48.352
How was your meeting?

03:48.354 --> 03:50.921
I confirmed the lack of
inducement or pressure.

03:50.923 --> 03:52.456
I assume you did likewise.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.626
We are approved.

03:55.628 --> 03:56.960
For what?

04:37.602 --> 04:40.237
I farted, I peed, I pooped,

04:40.239 --> 04:44.307
everything is working as well
as I can possibly hope.

04:44.309 --> 04:47.411
We just need to know there are
no post-surgical complications.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.446
You're not wearing a wedding ring.

04:49.448 --> 04:50.747
I'm not married.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.717
Well, gays can get married...

04:53.719 --> 04:56.520
they have children...
you need to have children.

04:56.522 --> 04:57.888
I'll tell you what's more interesting

04:57.890 --> 04:59.956
than a non-married woman
not wearing a ring.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.625
Dr. Park here wears a wedding ring

05:01.627 --> 05:03.627
even though he's not married.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.531
I'm divorced,

05:07.533 --> 05:09.433
but we're trying to reconcile.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.435
Well, good for you.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.570
- Kids?
- A son.

05:13.572 --> 05:15.038
BP looks good.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.940
How often do you see them?

05:16.942 --> 05:18.041
Dinners, I hope.

05:18.043 --> 05:20.644
I mean, dinners are really important.

05:20.646 --> 05:23.046
- They live in Phoenix.
- Oh, no.

05:23.048 --> 05:25.182
No, no, no, no, no.

05:25.184 --> 05:29.086
JP drain site looks good
with no bilious output.

05:29.088 --> 05:30.987
Do you have any other symptoms?

05:30.989 --> 05:32.723
I-I've got a bit of a stomachache,

05:32.725 --> 05:36.359
because of those nasty veggie slushies

05:36.361 --> 05:38.762
Dr. Mitzger has me on.

05:38.764 --> 05:40.764
Does this look inflamed?

05:40.766 --> 05:42.699
I don't think she's ready to go.

05:42.701 --> 05:44.134
What? Why not?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.936
We need to order
an abdominal ultrasound...

05:45.938 --> 05:49.239
make sure you don't have
a deep post-surgical abscess.

05:49.241 --> 05:52.442
Hopefully just one more day with us, Ida.

05:55.012 --> 05:58.081
I am concerned about
how you dealt with Dr. Murphy.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.851
Have you known anyone else with ASD?

06:00.853 --> 06:02.886
Not well. Have you?

06:04.222 --> 06:05.756
When you give people responsibility

06:05.758 --> 06:08.992
they can't handle,
the results can be devastating.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.195
Well, every time Dr. Murphy's
been given responsibility,

06:12.197 --> 06:13.330
he's risen to the occa...

06:13.332 --> 06:15.599
He's never been given responsibility.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.400
He's been given things to do,

06:17.402 --> 06:20.237
but always with someone right behind him.

06:20.239 --> 06:22.824
I'm the first one
to really challenge him.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.075
And he failed.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.666
Are you okay?

06:32.751 --> 06:34.351
Yes.

06:45.730 --> 06:49.299
When something bad happens,
we have to remember

06:49.301 --> 06:51.902
we're not defined by any one thing.

06:53.938 --> 06:56.525
You're not just a doctor, Shaun.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.319
You're a good friend,

06:59.912 --> 07:01.912
a good person.

07:01.914 --> 07:03.980
There are so many things you can do.

07:07.251 --> 07:08.652
What do you want?

07:11.255 --> 07:12.666
I want...

07:13.625 --> 07:15.725
to be a surgeon.

07:17.161 --> 07:18.505
What else?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.768
What else do you want?

07:29.608 --> 07:32.008
I want what everybody wants.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.810
I want...

07:36.148 --> 07:38.441
I want my life to matter.

07:39.451 --> 07:42.152
I want to have fun. I...

07:44.256 --> 07:46.089
I want to fall in love.

07:53.632 --> 07:55.799
I think I'd be a good father.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.138
I think you will be, too.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.246
But I don't know how to fall in love.

08:18.258 --> 08:19.890
Good morning, Claire.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.192
Good morning.

08:22.094 --> 08:24.027
Here are some chocolates.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.269
They're not really chocolates.

08:38.510 --> 08:40.419
Here's a stapler,

08:41.446 --> 08:43.480
which represents flowers.

08:45.617 --> 08:46.883
Thank you.

08:46.885 --> 08:48.485
These flowers are beautiful.

08:51.723 --> 08:53.289
You have nice hair.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.358
Thank you, Shaun.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.594
I like your shirt.

08:57.596 --> 08:59.395
It's old.

09:04.569 --> 09:08.782
I was wondering if you would like...

09:09.541 --> 09:10.950
to...

09:11.943 --> 09:14.245
Say the words.

09:14.913 --> 09:17.714
There could be other people
there that would be distracting.

09:17.716 --> 09:19.749
There could be noises
that would be distracting.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.885
She could misunderstand my question.

09:21.887 --> 09:23.686
- You can't let that...
- She could say no.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.494
Shaun.

09:40.304 --> 09:41.523
She will.

09:42.174 --> 09:45.041
Y-You don't know.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.276
Someone will.

09:48.979 --> 09:52.649
Shaun, you're gonna fall in love,

09:52.651 --> 09:54.918
and you're gonna have your heart broken.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.486
And you're gonna fall in love again.

09:59.089 --> 10:01.925
And you're gonna lose your job again.

10:01.927 --> 10:03.893
- No.
- Yeah.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.262
This is life. You know that.

10:06.264 --> 10:08.598
You've been hurt. And you've survived.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.428
You've gotten stronger, better.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.271
Not better.

10:17.342 --> 10:18.708
It's not better.

10:29.287 --> 10:30.954
Zack's tests are ready.

10:33.191 --> 10:35.391
Large iced, extra shot.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.794
Oh, no. No extra shot for me today.

10:37.796 --> 10:39.295
I'm already kinda up.

10:39.297 --> 10:41.631
- Having a good day?
- Uh...

10:41.633 --> 10:44.934
yeah, a real doozy.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.237
As of today,
- I'm officially cancer free.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.072
- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

10:49.074 --> 10:51.941
I'm so happy for you.

10:51.943 --> 10:55.011
You just got yourself

10:55.013 --> 10:57.080
a free coffee.

10:57.082 --> 11:00.059
Thank you. I got you something, too.

11:03.421 --> 11:04.988
A Model J.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.323
Just like the one that
we never got to see

11:07.325 --> 11:10.126
at the car show we never made it to.

11:12.363 --> 11:13.596
Wow.

11:13.598 --> 11:15.465
Open up the hood. Check out the engine.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.233
Oh, okay.

11:21.239 --> 11:23.873
You're right. We're too old

11:23.875 --> 11:25.241
to just have fun.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.943
I-I want to commit.

11:28.112 --> 11:29.512
Commit?

11:29.514 --> 11:32.582
I meant commit to a relationship.

11:32.584 --> 11:35.451
Not to, like, pledging our...

11:35.453 --> 11:37.520
never-ending love before God.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.656
In sickness and in health.
That's what you wanted.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.991
I have just been through
the seven levels of Hell.

11:41.993 --> 11:45.828
I am ready to embrace life, to be bold.

11:49.234 --> 11:51.801
This is definitely bold.

11:54.706 --> 11:56.539
It's... It's also...

11:57.775 --> 11:59.208
It's also stupid.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.589
I made it a part of our wedding vows.

12:12.290 --> 12:15.024
Marty and I pledged
we would never be apart

12:15.026 --> 12:17.894
for more than five days at a time,

12:17.896 --> 12:19.228
and we never were.

12:19.230 --> 12:22.465
Until he died two years ago.

12:22.467 --> 12:25.635
I made my daughter put it in her vows.

12:25.637 --> 12:27.670
Junie lives in Napa.

12:27.672 --> 12:31.207
Three children... two boys and a girl.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.709
You're still young.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.712
You should give your son
a brother and sister.

12:38.282 --> 12:39.682
Everything looks great.

12:39.684 --> 12:40.883
I think we can send you home.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.051
Good.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.654
Junie's driving in with her youngest.

12:44.656 --> 12:46.708
Oh.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.592
I-I can't feel my fingers.

12:53.497 --> 12:56.843
Other than the contusions, no hematoma.

12:57.302 --> 12:59.068
I wish you were back in Path.

13:00.471 --> 13:02.972
I don't wish I was back in Path.

13:04.943 --> 13:06.642
CBC is normal.

13:06.644 --> 13:08.644
Tox screen is basically clear.

13:08.646 --> 13:11.347
No drugs, trace amounts of alcohol.

13:13.650 --> 13:16.019
Maybe he tripped and hit his head.

13:16.021 --> 13:17.954
No. His gait was erratic,

13:17.956 --> 13:19.155
and so was his behavior...

13:19.157 --> 13:21.224
both highly suggestive of intoxication.

13:21.226 --> 13:23.659
I thought you found him unconscious.

13:29.334 --> 13:30.633
What happened?

13:32.637 --> 13:34.771
Did he do something to you?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.239
Say something to you?

13:38.676 --> 13:39.969
Shaun?

13:40.745 --> 13:42.345
You never lie.

13:42.347 --> 13:43.913
Why would you lie about this?

13:49.087 --> 13:52.588
If Zack wasn't intoxicated, then
he has a neurological issue...

13:52.590 --> 13:55.091
you need to run an EEG
and a CT angiogram.

13:55.093 --> 13:56.726
I have to go.

14:04.169 --> 14:06.969
Could be Guillain-Barré,
maybe peripheral neuropathy.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.271
I think we should perform an EMG

14:08.273 --> 14:09.972
and a nerve conduction study.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.008
- What do you want to do?
- Send her home.

14:13.077 --> 14:14.710
I think she's making it up.

14:14.712 --> 14:15.878
Her symptoms are very mild,

14:15.880 --> 14:17.680
very typical post-op reactions...

14:17.682 --> 14:18.815
except the one that suddenly appeared

14:18.817 --> 14:21.117
as soon as we told her she could go home.

14:21.119 --> 14:23.886
She's just lonely, looking for attention.

14:23.888 --> 14:25.321
She can be lonely <i>and</i> sick.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.323
According to the MRI, she's just lonely.

14:29.193 --> 14:30.693
It's no fun releasing a patient

14:30.695 --> 14:33.064
only to find them
in the morgue 24 hours later.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.032
Recheck her history,
run whatever tests you need,

14:36.034 --> 14:38.034
- rule out everything you can.
- Thank you.

14:38.036 --> 14:39.268
And congratulations.

14:40.804 --> 14:42.638
You and Dr. Lim.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.207
It's an excellent match.

15:09.233 --> 15:12.068
I have a sample I'd like you to test.

15:13.403 --> 15:15.204
Shaun, you don't work here anymore.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.039
How do you have a patient?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.841
It's Claire's patient.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.480
There's no patient name on it.

15:33.991 --> 15:37.260
What are... this patient's symptoms?

15:41.900 --> 15:43.833
He's coughing blood.

15:48.706 --> 15:51.007
I'll expedite the test.

15:59.463 --> 16:01.896
We'll get the data
analyzed by a neurologist

16:01.898 --> 16:04.466
- as soon as possible.
- And when it comes back okay,

16:04.468 --> 16:06.768
we could have you discharged
by the end of the day.

16:06.770 --> 16:09.170
You said "when"...

16:09.172 --> 16:10.972
You think I'm making this up?

16:10.974 --> 16:12.407
Wasting your time?

16:12.409 --> 16:14.109
- No, I...
- Yes.

16:14.111 --> 16:15.410
I do.

16:18.681 --> 16:21.416
- You're right.
- You're faking?

16:21.418 --> 16:22.798
No.

16:23.966 --> 16:25.760
Not entirely.

16:26.590 --> 16:29.724
I can feel my fingers.

16:30.097 --> 16:33.167
- But they're tingling.
- Because you're 87, Ida.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.519
These are just symptoms of old age.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.116
Junie had leukemia.

16:44.453 --> 16:48.657
Months of chemo, and she just
got sicker and weaker.

16:49.859 --> 16:52.961
Three days before her 9th birthday,

16:52.963 --> 16:57.432
two oncologists said there was
nothing more they could do.

17:00.202 --> 17:03.204
Told us that she would never
make it through the night.

17:07.310 --> 17:11.479
They said it was pointless,
"Oh, it... it's so cruel."

17:15.152 --> 17:19.454
But it wasn't
their little girl who was dying.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.797
The next morning

17:29.086 --> 17:30.786
Junie was still alive.

17:34.425 --> 17:38.582
And the morning after that,
she opened her eyes, and...

17:40.017 --> 17:43.254
all the people said,
"Oh, it's a miracle."

17:43.668 --> 17:45.501
But it wasn't a miracle.

17:48.873 --> 17:52.475
Junie is alive
with three beautiful children

17:52.477 --> 17:55.044
only because I refused
to let those doctors

17:55.046 --> 17:56.645
tell me what to do.

18:03.421 --> 18:05.318
And now that I'm old,

18:07.291 --> 18:09.625
they give me even less credit.

18:13.598 --> 18:16.065
We'll let you know the test results.

18:26.543 --> 18:28.878
WBC and PT are elevated,

18:28.880 --> 18:30.913
and hemoglobins are a little low.

18:31.302 --> 18:33.649
It could be pneumonia, DIC...

18:33.651 --> 18:35.618
It's trauma-induced,

18:35.620 --> 18:37.319
- so more like...
- Trauma?

18:45.662 --> 18:47.630
Then coagulopathy is possible,

18:47.632 --> 18:49.487
making bleeding worse.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.702
You need to get the patient

18:53.704 --> 18:56.739
on phytonadione as soon as possible.

18:58.475 --> 18:59.909
I'm writing a script.

19:07.584 --> 19:10.383
You'll tell your patient
how important this is, right?

19:21.865 --> 19:23.399
Good news, Ida.

19:23.401 --> 19:25.167
Normal electrical activity at rest,

19:25.169 --> 19:27.303
normal action potentials
with contraction.

19:27.305 --> 19:28.771
Thank you.

19:28.773 --> 19:30.839
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

19:30.841 --> 19:32.541
You don't have to <i>listen to your doctors.</i>

19:32.543 --> 19:34.810
But you do have to be honest with them.

19:34.812 --> 19:36.412
Park.

19:36.414 --> 19:37.713
Bile.

19:56.199 --> 19:58.934
They're treating you for rhabdomyolysis.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.936
That makes sense.

20:00.938 --> 20:03.872
- Why are you here?
- I am a doctor.

20:05.475 --> 20:06.976
Why are you sad?

20:12.449 --> 20:15.918
I'm sad and angry and...

20:15.920 --> 20:19.388
...confused and I don't know.

20:24.061 --> 20:26.495
I wasn't supposed to be at the bar.

20:26.497 --> 20:31.380
I was supposed to be at a job interview.

20:32.003 --> 20:34.536
Dr. Glassman got me a job interview,

20:34.538 --> 20:37.640
but I don't want a new job,

20:37.642 --> 20:40.342
and people tell me
that I have to move on,

20:40.344 --> 20:43.012
but why can't I just be sad

20:43.014 --> 20:45.347
and angry and...

21:06.270 --> 21:08.170
It's not rhabdo.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.573
You need immediate treatment.

21:11.575 --> 21:13.242
What?

21:13.244 --> 21:14.276
Wh... For what?

21:16.346 --> 21:18.302
For what? For what?!

21:18.949 --> 21:22.785
Tram... poline...

21:24.255 --> 21:25.654
Hey.

21:28.058 --> 21:29.558
Dr. Murphy?

21:32.128 --> 21:33.629
I need help in here!

21:37.761 --> 21:40.542
Left hemothorax and
grade 2 splenic laceration

21:40.544 --> 21:42.387
resulting from a rib fracture.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.688
Inserted a chest tube to reduce
the blood pooling

21:44.690 --> 21:46.290
in the pleural cavity.

21:46.292 --> 21:48.458
Any idea what caused the trauma?

21:48.460 --> 21:50.494
Zack Cordell beat him up.

21:50.496 --> 21:52.763
The patient he brought in?

21:52.765 --> 21:53.997
Shaun told you?

21:53.999 --> 21:55.432
Not explicitly.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.835
But... he was acting strange
from the minute they came in.

22:00.571 --> 22:03.940
Shaun acting strange isn't strange.

22:09.581 --> 22:10.747
Excuse me.

22:15.254 --> 22:17.788
Dr. Murphy saved another person today.

22:17.790 --> 22:21.625
Encountering an emergency
is not a job qualification.

22:21.627 --> 22:22.826
And how can you trust a doctor

22:22.828 --> 22:24.294
who doesn't have
the sense to tell someone

22:24.296 --> 22:26.196
he was injured before passing out?

22:26.198 --> 22:28.832
It's no longer a request, Jackson.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.768
Am I only allowed to do my job
when you agree with me?

22:31.770 --> 22:33.203
You knew someone on the spectrum.

22:33.205 --> 22:34.571
What happened to them?

22:36.174 --> 22:37.506
They died.

22:38.177 --> 22:39.576
But if either of us are making decisions

22:39.578 --> 22:41.044
based on our personal experiences,

22:41.046 --> 22:42.879
we're making the wrong decisions.

22:42.881 --> 22:44.888
You paid a lot of money for my judgment.

22:45.950 --> 22:47.351
Too much, I'm starting to think.

22:47.353 --> 22:49.186
Well, that was the point.

22:49.188 --> 22:50.887
I didn't need the money.

22:50.889 --> 22:52.521
I needed the commitment.

22:55.059 --> 22:57.394
You went out on a limb for me.

22:57.396 --> 22:59.930
You fire me now, you look like
a fool in front of the board.

23:07.039 --> 23:09.072
It's not the clips;

23:09.074 --> 23:10.748
Ida needs to be opened up again.

23:11.809 --> 23:14.344
That's too bad.

23:14.346 --> 23:16.213
There's one other test I'd like to try.

23:19.384 --> 23:23.120
I'm starting to feel
some pain on my left side.

23:23.122 --> 23:25.155
It's important for a doctor

23:25.157 --> 23:27.557
to use all their senses.

23:37.702 --> 23:40.103
Tastes like... a bit of kale,

23:40.105 --> 23:42.372
seven delicious vegetables...

23:42.374 --> 23:43.673
Good news is you don't have

23:43.675 --> 23:45.709
a potentially fatal bile duct issue.

23:45.711 --> 23:47.177
The bad news is

23:47.179 --> 23:49.012
we know you've been dumping
your veggie slushie

23:49.014 --> 23:51.214
into your drain to make us
think you were sick.

23:59.124 --> 24:01.425
You'll be discharged this afternoon.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.823
You asked to see me?

24:17.825 --> 24:19.843
Yeah, for the last two hours.

24:19.845 --> 24:22.245
I'm sorry. I've been dealing
with Dr. Murphy.

24:22.247 --> 24:23.713
It seems someone beat him up.

24:23.715 --> 24:26.016
- Quite severely.
- Yeah, that shouldn't have happened,

24:26.018 --> 24:27.150
but before he passed out,

24:27.152 --> 24:28.919
he said he knew what was wrong with me.

24:28.921 --> 24:30.420
Well, we all know what's wrong with you.

24:30.422 --> 24:32.355
You're an ass with
a head trauma and rhabdo.

24:32.357 --> 24:34.039
He said you're wrong.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.092
He kind of spaced out all distracted,

24:36.094 --> 24:39.129
then he said that I don't have
that and that I need treatment.

24:40.264 --> 24:41.631
Distracted how?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.768
Like, he was looking around

24:44.770 --> 24:47.270
trying to find something
in the air, I don't know.

24:47.272 --> 24:48.846
And then it looked like he found it.

24:51.008 --> 24:54.177
What exactly did he say?

24:54.179 --> 24:55.645
Trampoline?

24:55.647 --> 24:58.081
- And?
- That's it.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.616
You know Shaun. It could be a reference

24:59.618 --> 25:00.984
to something he read somewhere.

25:00.986 --> 25:03.186
It could be a metaphor.

25:03.188 --> 25:04.888
It could be the guy misheard.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.490
It could be delirium.

25:06.492 --> 25:08.291
Shaun had a systolic pressure of 70;

25:08.293 --> 25:10.727
he may have been hallucinating;

25:10.729 --> 25:12.996
he may have just been wrong.

25:15.967 --> 25:17.734
He's hypotensive, O2 SATs are dropping.

25:17.736 --> 25:19.835
- He's crashing!
- Bag him.

25:20.305 --> 25:22.372
Bolus five units of
vasopressin and start a drip.

25:31.984 --> 25:35.267
"Trampoline," from
the Spanish word <i>trampolino,</i>

25:35.267 --> 25:36.366
<i>meaning "springboard,"</i>

25:36.368 --> 25:38.134
from the Italian root <i>trampoli,</i>

25:38.136 --> 25:39.455
meaning "stilts."

25:39.456 --> 25:41.790
Maybe Shaun was talking about

25:41.792 --> 25:44.225
an excessive growth disorder
like acromegaly.

25:44.227 --> 25:45.794
But instead of just saying
the name of the disorder,

25:45.796 --> 25:47.295
he used the English translation

25:47.297 --> 25:49.831
of the Spanish derivative of the Italian?

25:51.935 --> 25:53.401
Maybe we should just wake him up.

25:53.403 --> 25:55.603
His respiratory status is too fragile.

25:55.605 --> 25:58.340
We have a very sick patient.
If Shaun can save his life...

25:58.342 --> 26:00.442
We have <i>two</i> very sick patients,

26:00.444 --> 26:02.377
and if there's a 1% chance
that waking Shaun

26:02.379 --> 26:04.446
will risk his life I say we don't do it.

26:08.751 --> 26:09.951
We shouldn't need Shaun.

26:09.953 --> 26:11.953
We can figure this out ourselves.

26:11.955 --> 26:13.188
What do we know?

26:13.190 --> 26:15.457
Low BP, nausea, and dizziness,

26:15.459 --> 26:17.392
erratic gait and behavior.

26:18.435 --> 26:21.329
Adrenal insufficiency
could explain his gait and BP.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.931
We'd be seeing hyperpigmentation.

26:23.966 --> 26:26.134
- Botulism?
- There'd be descending paralysis;

26:26.136 --> 26:27.502
if anything he has ascending.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.365
Lyme disease?

26:32.843 --> 26:35.610
Explains fatigue and dizziness
and, if advanced,

26:35.612 --> 26:37.212
impaired muscle movement.

26:37.214 --> 26:40.165
And an arrhythmia
could be lowering his BP.

26:40.751 --> 26:44.819
None of this sounds like...

26:44.821 --> 26:46.121
"trampoline."

26:48.758 --> 26:51.526
Let's get him started on
100 milligrams of doxycycline.

27:52.222 --> 27:53.221
- Do you need...
- Shh.

27:54.624 --> 27:56.191
Sorry, sorry.

27:58.995 --> 28:01.830
You were on duty when
Dr. Murphy passed out, right?

28:01.832 --> 28:03.465
I was first one in.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.292
Is this where he was standing?

28:06.303 --> 28:08.378
I think he was closer to the patient.

28:11.974 --> 28:13.675
Hmm...

28:14.377 --> 28:16.978
W-What about the blinds?
Were they like that?

28:18.614 --> 28:20.748
Please, I need to know what
Shaun's experience was

28:20.750 --> 28:22.601
when he was standing here.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.666
Also, could I get a step stool?

28:36.365 --> 28:37.665
Sure.

28:38.075 --> 28:39.167
Thanks.

28:45.774 --> 28:47.575
Why can't you get him his job back?

28:47.577 --> 28:50.812
You were the president for,
like, a hundred years.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.965
I'm gonna fight for him,
but I'm only one vote.

28:56.051 --> 28:58.387
We all get smacked around.

28:59.022 --> 29:00.455
We got to learn to take the hits,

29:00.457 --> 29:03.183
lick our wounds, and move on.

29:07.530 --> 29:09.164
He likes you, you know?

29:09.166 --> 29:11.366
Yeah, I like him, too.

29:11.368 --> 29:12.700
He likes you more.

29:14.603 --> 29:15.870
When he gets rejected,

29:15.872 --> 29:19.741
I'm glad it's coming from
somebody who cares about him.

30:17.968 --> 30:20.201
We need an OR stat!

30:27.643 --> 30:29.519
Hey, Shaun.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.329
It's me, Auntie Em.

30:34.031 --> 30:37.501
What are you doing in my room?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.770
No, Shaun, we're in the hospital.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.338
You were pretty bad earlier,

30:41.340 --> 30:44.007
- but now you...
- Zack... Zack...

30:44.009 --> 30:46.143
Zack has the wrong diagnosis.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.878
- No, no, no, Shaun. I know.
- No, no, he'll...

30:47.880 --> 30:49.505
- It's fine. It's actually fine.
- He'll die unless he's

30:49.530 --> 30:50.680
treated immediately.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.915
- Shaun, it's fine.
- No, he needs...

30:51.917 --> 30:53.183
"Trampoline."

30:55.820 --> 30:58.555
Zack had an aortic arch aneurysm

30:58.557 --> 31:00.490
with signs of impending rupture,

31:00.492 --> 31:03.627
the evidence of which was
a pulsatile mass in his neck.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.762
That and his erratic gait and behavior

31:05.764 --> 31:08.765
are explained by the fact
that he had tertiary syphilis.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.100
Also known as...

31:11.869 --> 31:13.203
Treponema.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.805
Zack misheard you,

31:14.807 --> 31:17.207
but we were able to repair the aneurysm,

31:17.209 --> 31:18.860
and he is stable now.

31:19.344 --> 31:20.695
Okay.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.014
Okay.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.615
All right.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.951
Lie down, Dorothy.
Get some rest, all right?

31:32.924 --> 31:35.358
We finally got her history.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.695
Those doctors who said Junie
wouldn't survive the night,

31:38.697 --> 31:40.697
they were right.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.510
Three days before
her 9th birthday, Junie died.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.503
Ida never had any grandchildren.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.238
What about her husband?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.307
He did pass away two years ago,

31:50.309 --> 31:53.677
but he and Ida separated
after their daughter's death.

31:58.851 --> 32:00.917
It doesn't change anything medically.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.408
I'm sorry.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.813
You know what $300,000
can get you in Tempe?

32:49.333 --> 32:51.234
How are you doing?

32:51.236 --> 32:54.237
I have an O2 SAT of 97%

32:54.239 --> 32:57.173
and urine output of 200cc an hour,

32:57.175 --> 32:58.875
so I'm doing well.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.379
I just got off the phone

33:02.381 --> 33:05.282
with Dr. Turner at San Jose General.

33:07.351 --> 33:09.019
You missed a job interview?

33:09.021 --> 33:11.181
I like being a surgeon here.

33:15.226 --> 33:16.860
But you're not anymore.

33:19.297 --> 33:20.830
And we can't change that.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.907
Shaun.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.204
Both of us...

33:36.682 --> 33:38.915
we need to face reality.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.856
My brother Steve said

33:46.858 --> 33:50.293
that whenever people
want you to do something

33:50.295 --> 33:52.162
they think is wrong,

33:52.164 --> 33:54.297
they say it's "reality."

34:04.743 --> 34:06.576
Yesterday, Dr. Shaun Murphy

34:06.578 --> 34:08.737
did something that was different.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.748
And it wasn't because he showed mercy

34:11.750 --> 34:15.652
to someone who had been
cruel and violent to him,

34:15.654 --> 34:17.654
although that's extraordinary.

34:17.656 --> 34:21.291
What was different is that
yesterday, Dr. Shaun Murphy

34:21.293 --> 34:23.760
made Dr. Claire Browne a better doctor.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.196
Why? Because Dr. Claire Browne

34:26.197 --> 34:29.466
looked at a problem
through Dr. Murphy's eyes

34:29.467 --> 34:31.136
and she saved a life.

34:32.188 --> 34:33.937
And that's extraordinary.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.351
Dr. Han,

34:40.411 --> 34:42.679
Dr. Murphy may not communicate
like you do.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.348
He may not communicate
like I do, but make no mistake.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.943
He does communicate.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.284
And he inspires.

34:51.222 --> 34:52.889
Well, welcome back

34:52.891 --> 34:54.958
to the Board, Dr. Glassman.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.993
I've heard of your insights and passion,

34:56.995 --> 35:00.030
and I'm grateful to witness it.

35:00.032 --> 35:01.452
Thank you.

35:01.454 --> 35:05.378
But I didn't fire Dr. Murphy
because he doesn't inspire.

35:06.704 --> 35:09.472
I fired him because he was irrational,

35:09.474 --> 35:11.574
unprofessional.

35:11.576 --> 35:12.909
He couldn't calm down.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.971
He couldn't control himself.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.180
I stand by that decision.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.317
And if Dr. Glassman insists

35:21.319 --> 35:23.353
on putting this to a vote,
the issue isn't

35:23.355 --> 35:25.815
whether Dr. Murphy
should be working here.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.651
The issue is whether I should.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.695
Whether I control my staff.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.598
Because I can't work here if I don't.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.334
Okay.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.977
I don't think there's anything
else on the agenda, so...

35:47.979 --> 35:49.479
Steve was right.

35:51.982 --> 35:55.018
And Dr. Glassman is right.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.656
You're gonna propose his motion?

35:59.658 --> 36:02.325
Dr. Andrews, I don't think
you have the votes to carry it.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.893
I agree.

36:05.396 --> 36:06.996
But I don't need the votes.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.935
Just as you have the power
to fire someone

36:11.937 --> 36:14.370
under your supervision, so do I.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.740
You're gonna fire me to save Dr. Murphy.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.211
He's not ready to move on.

36:24.116 --> 36:25.782
Neither am I.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.429
Did you hear about Han?

36:39.431 --> 36:41.831
Can't imagine Andrews
will survive the fallout.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.400
They're gonna need
a new Chief of Surgery;

36:44.402 --> 36:46.302
what if either of us is offered the job?

36:46.304 --> 36:48.204
One of us bossing the other around?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.874
I don't think that would fly with HR.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.609
Someone would have to resign.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.477
Or we'd have to break up.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.863
Or...

36:56.348 --> 36:57.781
we could turn it down...

37:02.052 --> 37:05.455
I think... things are great.

37:05.457 --> 37:09.092
And they've been great for,
what, four weeks now?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.026
Just over a month.

37:12.129 --> 37:13.663
It'd be crazy to pass on a chance

37:13.665 --> 37:14.931
at being a department head.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.735
Are you that crazy?

37:21.005 --> 37:22.181
No.

37:23.508 --> 37:24.607
Are you?

37:26.845 --> 37:28.011
No.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.781
Good.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.278
I talked to Andrews' assistant.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.121
Aoki should be calling you
with the offer any minute.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.738
You'd better answer.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.345
Hello.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.313
Ms. Aoki, it's good to hear from you.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.696
Hi... Shaun.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.604
I got my job back.

38:27.606 --> 38:28.805
That's great.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.910
I have a question for you.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.088
Yes.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.946
I don... I don't mean yes.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.749
I also don't mean no.
Just what is the question?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.395
Do I look nice?

38:54.832 --> 38:57.166
Yes, Shaun.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.369
You look very nice.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.219
I know myself.

39:23.828 --> 39:25.805
I know what I want,

39:26.331 --> 39:28.364
and I know what I love.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.033
You don't love me.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.701
You barely know me.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.002
I think I do.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.856
I think I know you.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.507
And, sure, we could go out
on another date

39:37.509 --> 39:38.841
and another date after that

39:38.843 --> 39:41.244
and more dates after that,
but life is short

39:41.246 --> 39:43.313
and getting shorter, and I want to spend

39:43.315 --> 39:48.818
whatever time I have left with you.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.753
When we're together,

39:50.755 --> 39:54.557
it feels like we're speeding
down the PCH in a Duesenberg,

39:54.559 --> 39:59.128
12 cylinders with 400cc and turbo boosts

39:59.130 --> 40:02.765
and picnic basket in the back
with baguettes and Gruyère

40:02.767 --> 40:05.134
and prosciutto and Chateauneuf du Pape,

40:05.136 --> 40:07.704
and you're sitting next to me,
wind in your hair,

40:07.706 --> 40:10.850
and you're laughing that laugh,

40:11.776 --> 40:15.799
and the sun, and the ocean.

40:15.801 --> 40:20.016
And it just feels like we can go forever.

40:25.357 --> 40:28.826
Debbie Wexler,

40:29.961 --> 40:33.896
will you marry me?

40:36.401 --> 40:38.401
Yes.

41:18.609 --> 41:20.711
You have nice hair.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.380
I know, fabulous. I was ju...

41:24.382 --> 41:27.093
Here are flowers and chocolates.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.688
Real ones.

41:34.391 --> 41:37.126
I was wondering if...

41:41.131 --> 41:44.944
...you would like to...

41:51.842 --> 41:54.203
...eat dinner?

41:57.548 --> 41:58.881
Are you asking me out?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.619
Yes.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.423
On a date?

42:06.824 --> 42:07.924
Yes.

42:10.260 --> 42:11.694
I would love to.
