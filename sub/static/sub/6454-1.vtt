01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:06.655
I thought we had an understanding,
but if we need to discuss it some more...

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:09.907
...I'm sure I can find a needle and thread.

01:15:10.997 --> 01:15:13.086
Don't you fucking touch her!

01:15:14.266 --> 01:15:16.626
You move, you breathe, you're dead.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.049
[YELPS]

01:15:26.377 --> 01:15:28.210
- Katie, run!
- [CHRISTIAN SCREAMING]

01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.671
[CHRISTIAN SCREAMING, GRUNTS]

01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:33.763
Run!

01:15:37.256 --> 01:15:38.688
CHRISTIAN: Mallory.

01:15:43.462 --> 01:15:45.042
Mallory.

01:15:47.099 --> 01:15:49.146
Mallory!

01:15:51.337 --> 01:15:53.110
You really are full of surprises.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.236
It's been a long time since
I've had so much fun. Really.

01:16:04.716 --> 01:16:06.729
I ought to thank you for that.

01:16:08.721 --> 01:16:10.656
I am curious though...

01:16:10.736 --> 01:16:12.737
...how you manage to get out.

01:16:16.929 --> 01:16:19.285
I thought you were going to die in there.

01:16:19.365 --> 01:16:21.211
One way or another.

01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:26.016
Perhaps this was how it was meant to be.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.900
- Boo!
- [SCREAMS]

01:16:33.246 --> 01:16:36.860
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Can't run from fate, Mallory!

01:16:38.825 --> 01:16:40.697
Oh, shit!

01:16:42.922 --> 01:16:44.701
No matter how hard you try.

01:16:48.627 --> 01:16:51.241
- Almost!
- Get the fuck away from me!

01:16:54.366 --> 01:16:56.205
This was how I hoped it would end.

01:16:56.285 --> 01:16:58.591
I always knew it would happen this way.

01:16:58.671 --> 01:17:01.118
Does this feel like your destiny now?

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:06.786
[CHRISTIAN SCREAMING]

01:17:35.641 --> 01:17:36.753
Mallory!

01:17:37.677 --> 01:17:39.489
I know you're out there.

01:17:43.582 --> 01:17:45.672
[SCREAMING]

01:17:46.452 --> 01:17:48.967
- [BEAR TRAP SNAPS]
- [CHRISTIAN SCREAMING]

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.045
Fu...

01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:54.898
[GROANING]

01:17:56.428 --> 01:17:59.075
- CHRISTIAN: Fuck!
- MALLORY: It's okay.

01:17:59.932 --> 01:18:01.945
[SPITS]

01:18:05.471 --> 01:18:07.360
That looks painful. [GROANING]

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.052
- Do you need some help?
- [CHRISTIAN SCOFFS]

01:18:16.883 --> 01:18:20.820
Now, now, I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.975
[EXHALING]

01:18:23.055 --> 01:18:25.102
That's an awful lot of blood.

01:18:27.493 --> 01:18:29.616
I'm guessing you missed
your femoral artery...

01:18:30.296 --> 01:18:32.618
...because, frankly,
you'd be dead by now if you hadn't.

01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:36.049
- CHRISTIAN: Oh, fuck you.
- God knows what other damage you've done.

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.217
[GRUNTING]

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.386
It doesn't look good.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.806
[EXHALING]

01:18:52.919 --> 01:18:56.548
Now, I'd love to stay and chat,
but I've gotta get going.

01:18:57.223 --> 01:18:59.712
I wouldn't want you
to think I was being unfair.

01:18:59.792 --> 01:19:03.272
So I'm going to give you
the same chance that you gave me.

01:19:10.569 --> 01:19:12.959
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.

01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:15.538
About fate.

01:19:16.408 --> 01:19:18.328
[GRUNTS]

01:19:19.278 --> 01:19:21.134
Maybe you were right.

01:19:22.114 --> 01:19:24.577
Maybe it was supposed to be like this.

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.821
Maybe you just got in the wrong fucking car!

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.662
Help!

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:53.089
MALLORY: It's okay.

01:19:53.169 --> 01:19:55.185
It's over. It's over.

01:19:56.115 --> 01:19:58.004
You're going to be okay.

01:19:58.334 --> 01:20:00.356
