JOST: <i>Albert Einstein.</i>

00:03.139 --> 00:04.838
Your reputation precedes you.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.842
HERMANN: <i>Your mother,
sister and I are moving</i>

00:06.843 --> 00:09.211
- to Italy.
- So you're abandoning me?

00:09.212 --> 00:11.946
HERMANN: <i>No! I'm looking
out for your future.</i>

00:11.947 --> 00:12.891
PAULINE: <i>How is Marie?</i>

00:12.892 --> 00:14.702
EINSTEIN: <i>Wonderful.
She's teaching me French.</i>

00:14.703 --> 00:16.805
HERMANN: <i>You will go back to
Munich, and that is an order.</i>

00:16.806 --> 00:17.651
I'm sorry, Father,

00:17.652 --> 00:19.086
but I'm not going back to Germany.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.801
- It is time to stand up for Germany!
- (applause)

00:21.802 --> 00:23.748
Tell me, my son, uh, the genius,

00:23.749 --> 00:26.207
how do you propose to make
a living without a job?

00:26.208 --> 00:27.292
I'm going to be a professor.

00:27.293 --> 00:29.302
HERMANN: <i>You failed your entrance exam!</i>

00:29.303 --> 00:30.355
EINSTEIN: <i>I won't fail again.</i>

00:30.356 --> 00:31.601
Welcome to Zurich Polytechnic.

00:31.602 --> 00:33.485
EINSTEIN: I apologize,
I didn't think...

00:33.486 --> 00:35.049
That a woman could possibly understand

00:35.050 --> 00:37.382
the Maxwell-Faraday equation.

00:37.383 --> 00:39.811
Einstein, say hello to Mileva Maric.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.124
Thank you, Papa, she's so beautiful.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.519
She makes such lovely colors.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.212
It's called refraction.

01:34.213 --> 01:36.861
All the colors are there,
inside the light.

01:36.862 --> 01:39.865
The glass just pulls it
apart so we can see.

01:40.981 --> 01:42.991
Did they teach you that in school?

01:42.992 --> 01:44.970
We don't learn about science in school.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.921
I found it in a book.

01:51.454 --> 01:56.625
What ever will become of
you, my brilliant Mileva?

01:56.626 --> 01:58.253
WEBER: Energy moves.
(writing on chalk board)

01:58.254 --> 02:00.457
And it changes, through work.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.213
Through heat.

02:02.214 --> 02:05.085
It passes into and out of the
systems that govern our lives.

02:05.086 --> 02:06.778
And, as these systems interact,

02:06.779 --> 02:07.735
they seek balance.

02:07.736 --> 02:08.820
A block of ice

02:08.821 --> 02:11.024
in a hot room melts.

02:11.025 --> 02:13.131
And along with this transfer of energy

02:13.132 --> 02:15.940
comes an associated
increase in entropy.

02:15.941 --> 02:17.697
Now, this process,

02:17.698 --> 02:19.616
like all natural processes, is...

02:20.890 --> 02:22.072
irreversible.

02:22.073 --> 02:23.284
The ice melts.

02:23.285 --> 02:24.755
However, it...

02:31.203 --> 02:33.276
Is there something the matter,
Miss Maric?

02:33.277 --> 02:35.767
With me? No, sir, nothing.

02:35.768 --> 02:36.793
Are you confused?

02:37.907 --> 02:39.571
It's only, w...

02:40.525 --> 02:41.866
If heat is a result

02:41.867 --> 02:43.645
of the motion of the
underlying molecules

02:43.646 --> 02:45.210
and Newton's laws of motion

02:45.211 --> 02:46.037
are reversible,

02:46.038 --> 02:48.470
then what explains
irreversibility here?

02:49.554 --> 02:50.926
In this class

02:50.927 --> 02:53.448
we will deal only with
what has been proven.

02:53.449 --> 02:56.325
The existence of molecules has not.

02:58.174 --> 02:59.771
Miss Maric raises a fair question, sir.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.207
Herr Einstein, please.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.508
These pencils for example...

03:06.379 --> 03:08.039
Of course they won't hop off the floor

03:08.040 --> 03:10.051
- and neatly rearrange themselves
back in the box, - Herr Einstein...

03:10.052 --> 03:11.965
but they could,
mathematically, could they not?

03:11.966 --> 03:13.594
<i>Newton's equations work both ways,</i>

03:13.595 --> 03:15.734
<i>so, theoretically,</i>

03:15.735 --> 03:17.871
if the movement of molecules
is the underlying principle...

03:17.872 --> 03:19.153
Herr Einstein!

03:24.035 --> 03:28.088
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but we do not engage

03:28.089 --> 03:29.398
in theatrics here.

03:29.399 --> 03:30.579
Apologies, sir.

03:30.580 --> 03:31.702
Thank you.

03:32.942 --> 03:34.506
As was my point,

03:34.507 --> 03:35.783
a block of ice melts...

03:35.784 --> 03:37.830
EINSTEIN: <i>Miss Maric!</i>

03:38.945 --> 03:41.403
Miss Maric! A word?

03:41.404 --> 03:43.797
I've no time for idle
conversation, Herr Einstein.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.266
Nor do I.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.628
Of what use is
conversation if it's idle?

03:47.629 --> 03:49.512
No, I-I wanted to discuss

03:49.513 --> 03:51.108
your inquiry in class.

03:51.109 --> 03:52.992
- Did I seem in distress?
- Excuse me?

03:52.993 --> 03:55.164
As though I was in need of a savior?

03:55.165 --> 03:56.825
Uh, quite the contrary.

03:56.826 --> 03:59.155
Then I'm unsure why you
took it upon yourself

03:59.156 --> 04:01.548
to intercede with
Professor Weber on my behalf,

04:01.549 --> 04:02.827
or why you believe you're entitled

04:02.828 --> 04:04.804
to my attention in this moment.

04:04.805 --> 04:07.072
I can assure you,
I come highly recommended.

04:07.073 --> 04:08.354
Herr Einstein...

04:10.010 --> 04:11.573
...are you attempting to flirt with me?

04:11.574 --> 04:14.862
Well, that wasn't
my intention, but I...

04:14.863 --> 04:16.971
I did not come to university to flirt,

04:16.971 --> 04:19.045
or to meet a man, and certainly not

04:19.046 --> 04:21.152
to find a husband.

04:21.153 --> 04:22.690
I fear you've misunderstood
me, I merely...

04:22.691 --> 04:24.125
Stay away from me!

04:26.357 --> 04:28.208
MAN: Good God, man,
what did you do to her?

04:28.209 --> 04:30.920
I have no idea.

04:30.921 --> 04:32.680
What a troubled creature.

04:32.681 --> 04:34.402
Uh, we didn't have a chance
to meet before class.

04:34.403 --> 04:35.966

04:35.967 --> 04:37.666
Albert Einstein. Sorry
about your pencils.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.510
Oh, no. No apology necessary.

04:39.511 --> 04:41.617
It was a-a compelling
demonstration, actually.

04:41.618 --> 04:43.439
Yes, for a moment, I
thought we'd bear witness

04:43.440 --> 04:44.748
to an explosive transfer of energy

04:44.749 --> 04:46.727
from Professor Weber's skull.

04:46.728 --> 04:48.800
Well, that would have been
fantastically irreversible.

of understanding the world around me.

Don't you already know

in the sciences

09:36.589 --> 09:38.089
Eastern Europe has to offer.

there weren't any books

10:13.116 --> 10:15.156
on electromagnetic theory near home.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.160
So the methods of Faraday have,
uh, piqued your interest?

10:18.161 --> 10:19.787
Oh, yes.

10:19.788 --> 10:22.566
It is Faraday's concepts
of fields and potentials

10:22.567 --> 10:24.224
that provide the most natural setting

10:24.225 --> 10:26.719
for the mathematical discoveries
of Green and Gauss.

10:31.186 --> 10:32.908
WEBER: <i>It is not often

10:32.909 --> 10:34.537

not all your professors

10:36.772 --> 10:38.943
share my patience with
your eccentricities.

10:38.944 --> 10:41.146

- You are skipping classes,

10:41.147 --> 10:43.764
missing assignments and
challenging your instructors.

10:43.765 --> 10:45.807
Frankly, you give the impression

10:45.808 --> 10:47.787
you think you have all the answers.

10:47.788 --> 10:49.065
The opposite, in fact.

find answers if I don't ask?

where you place your attention.

to take up your case

11:21.120 --> 11:22.429

11:22.430 --> 11:23.609

11:23.610 --> 11:25.398

11:25.399 --> 11:26.962
in securing your future.

11:26.963 --> 11:31.049
If... you prove my faith founded.

11:31.050 --> 11:34.049
Of course.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.648
I-I'll do my best, sir.

11:35.649 --> 11:37.599
Good.

12:04.248 --> 12:05.895
Miss Maric.

12:05.896 --> 12:07.171
Good evening.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.514
Is Herr Einstein in?

12:08.515 --> 12:09.692
He is not.

12:09.693 --> 12:12.248
I believe he is still
in Aarau with Marie.

12:12.249 --> 12:14.742
- Marie?
- His fiancée.

12:17.262 --> 12:19.304
No message, then?

12:19.305 --> 12:20.840
Just this.

12:29.554 --> 12:31.403
MARIJA: <i>As if it wasn't
struggle enough for her</i>

12:31.404 --> 12:32.841
<i>that she was born lame.</i>

12:32.842 --> 12:35.077
This will ruin her.

12:35.078 --> 12:36.736
I will not have our
daughter dragged down

12:36.737 --> 12:39.802
by these antiquated
notions of femininity.

12:39.803 --> 12:42.037
She has not only passed
her entrance exam,

12:42.038 --> 12:43.952
she scored higher than anyone.

12:43.953 --> 12:45.837
Do you think the world
will clear a path for her

12:45.838 --> 12:46.955
simply because you will it?

12:46.956 --> 12:48.071
Not because I will it.

12:48.072 --> 12:49.794
Because I fight for her.

12:49.795 --> 12:51.233
Out there.

12:51.234 --> 12:53.019
But here? In my own home?

12:53.020 --> 12:54.618
With my wife? No!

12:54.619 --> 12:57.043
There will be no discussion.

12:57.044 --> 13:01.068
Well, no man ever married
a woman for her mind, hmm?

13:02.886 --> 13:04.706
Marija...

13:04.707 --> 13:06.178
(crying softly)

13:10.038 --> 13:11.059
Don't worry, Mama.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.464
I won't need to marry.

13:12.465 --> 13:15.469
I plan to be a scientist.

13:17.284 --> 13:19.518
JOST: <i>Oh, my beautiful daughter.</i>

13:19.519 --> 13:22.360
What a joy it is, to
celebrate your birth.

13:22.361 --> 13:25.362
Seems any day now, we will
be losing you to another man.

13:25.363 --> 13:27.278
But we could do worse than you, Albert.

13:27.279 --> 13:28.235
Not much.

13:28.236 --> 13:29.352
(clamoring)

13:29.353 --> 13:30.693
Ow.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.545
JOST: Who knew
inviting you into our home

13:32.546 --> 13:34.941
those years back, we would expand

13:34.942 --> 13:37.751
our merry band so exponentially?

13:37.752 --> 13:39.729
Dear Maja is as much
a sister to our girls

13:39.730 --> 13:41.326
as she is to you.

13:41.327 --> 13:42.954
And now you've brought us Mr. Besso.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.093
Such a charming dinner companion.

13:45.094 --> 13:46.818
I hope you'll return
for many more meals.

13:46.819 --> 13:47.807
Mm. Yes.

13:47.808 --> 13:49.660
And so would Anna, apparently.

13:49.661 --> 13:51.702
Julius. Enough.

13:51.703 --> 13:53.970
JOST: But most importantly,

13:53.971 --> 13:55.628
thank you, Albert.

13:55.629 --> 13:58.857
For making our Marie so very happy.

13:59.909 --> 14:01.664
To Marie.

14:01.665 --> 14:04.413
ALL: To Marie!

14:09.741 --> 14:10.890
MARIE: What happened?

14:10.891 --> 14:12.200
(chuckles)

14:12.201 --> 14:15.200
I was, I was working
with a Kundt's tube,

14:15.201 --> 14:16.542
measuring the effect of temperature

14:16.543 --> 14:18.425
on the speed of sound waves,

14:18.426 --> 14:20.532
and in an attempt
to magnify their amplitude,

14:20.533 --> 14:22.192
I neglected to compensate

14:22.193 --> 14:23.501
for the flammable nature of the...

14:23.502 --> 14:24.779
<i>Cheri, Cheri,</i>

14:24.780 --> 14:26.533
<i>Ce Que Tu dis n'a aucun sens.</i>

14:26.534 --> 14:28.612
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

14:28.613 --> 14:29.761
Exactly.

14:29.762 --> 14:31.772
You never did pay any attention

14:31.773 --> 14:32.952
during our French lessons,

14:32.953 --> 14:35.443
and sadly, physics is not my forte.

14:35.444 --> 14:37.868
I'm sorry.

14:37.869 --> 14:42.406
Of course you, you don't
want to discuss physics.

14:46.682 --> 14:49.463
I don't want to discuss anything.

14:59.486 --> 15:03.156
Take me for a walk.

15:03.157 --> 15:05.298
(giggles)

15:07.626 --> 15:09.605
Oh!

15:09.606 --> 15:11.360
I can't thank you
enough for the welcome

15:11.361 --> 15:12.509
your family has shown me.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.851
Our pleasure.

15:13.852 --> 15:15.287
- The train won't wait.
- Take a breath, son,

15:15.288 --> 15:17.686
there's plenty of time.

15:24.198 --> 15:26.049
Well, Miss Winteler.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.692
I do hope you'll return sooner
rather than later, Mr. Besso.

15:32.977 --> 15:34.381
(whispers): Oh, look it,
you're blushing.

15:34.382 --> 15:36.137
MARIE: I could make the trip to Milan.

15:36.138 --> 15:38.501
Maybe...

15:38.502 --> 15:41.534
But Grossmann's family
have a house on a lake

15:41.535 --> 15:44.501
and I've been invited
to join them. So...

15:44.502 --> 15:46.453
I do enjoy sailing.

15:49.579 --> 15:53.249
Albert, you would tell me if
something was troubling you.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.882
Of course, Mariechien.

16:04.553 --> 16:06.915
You know I'm a modern man, Albert,

16:06.916 --> 16:09.340
but my Marie is risking
a great deal with you.

16:09.341 --> 16:11.580
I expect you to do right by her.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.422
Safe travels, son.

16:21.603 --> 16:23.138
Okay.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.456
BESSO: <i>God, I close my eyes,</i>

16:29.457 --> 16:31.436
and her face is all I see.

16:31.437 --> 16:34.309
This conversation is
far past insufferable.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.714
You should have joined us.

16:35.715 --> 16:37.086
There is a third sister.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.832
You would have enjoyed her company.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.492
I'm not in the market for a wife.

16:41.493 --> 16:42.673
Who said anything about shopping?

16:42.674 --> 16:43.950
I'm talking about love.

16:43.951 --> 16:46.505
Oh, Jesus, save me. Albert, please.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.261
Albert.

16:48.262 --> 16:50.208
What?

16:50.209 --> 16:51.294
Your fiancée.

16:51.295 --> 16:53.049
I want the sordid details.

16:53.050 --> 16:56.466
I don't understand how
you all arrived at this notion

16:56.467 --> 16:57.869
that we're engaged.

16:57.870 --> 16:59.787
I can't understand your reluctance.

16:59.788 --> 17:03.522
She is beautiful, she is kind.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.883
And she loves you so deeply.

17:05.884 --> 17:08.630
I'm not sure I want to spend my life

17:08.631 --> 17:11.250
with a woman who can't carry
a compelling conversation

17:11.251 --> 17:13.324
on the nature of things.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.358
That is not what wives are for.

17:16.358 --> 17:17.730
For once, I am with Marcel.

17:17.731 --> 17:20.220
Tell me why I put up
with you bourgeois bores.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.136
Because you want to
borrow my geometry notes,

17:22.137 --> 17:23.289
you faux bohemian.

17:23.290 --> 17:24.657
(laughter)

17:24.659 --> 17:26.957
All right. Uh...

17:26.958 --> 17:28.521
Here. Ah.

17:28.521 --> 17:30.916
That odd little gimp
stopped by the other day.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.790
- Gimp?
- Hmm.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.806
You mean Mileva.

17:40.176 --> 17:43.112
She does have a little hitch
in her gait, doesn't she?

17:43.113 --> 17:45.250
Do love the sound of her voice, though.

17:45.251 --> 17:47.265
(laughter)

17:51.893 --> 17:53.808
(sniffles)

17:53.809 --> 17:55.882
Miss Maric! Miss Maric.

17:55.883 --> 17:58.916
What a kind gesture,
leaving this book for me.

17:58.917 --> 18:01.407
I couldn't help but think
about the pencils.

18:01.408 --> 18:03.131
From our first class?

18:03.132 --> 18:05.844
If we think of entropy
as Boltzmann does,

18:05.845 --> 18:07.857
as a measure of
probability, well, then,

18:07.858 --> 18:10.315
the process is irreversible,

18:10.316 --> 18:13.667
because the number of possible
configurations for the pencils

18:13.668 --> 18:16.380
outside of the box is nearly infinite,

18:16.381 --> 18:18.361
whereas there's
only a handful of possibilities

18:18.362 --> 18:19.562
for the way they fit back in...

18:19.563 --> 18:20.661
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

18:20.662 --> 18:21.870
Now if you'll excuse me...

18:29.951 --> 18:32.025
Don't go.

18:32.026 --> 18:34.579
We don't have much
time left in the term,

18:34.580 --> 18:36.495
and there are...

18:36.496 --> 18:39.944
things I want to talk
to you about, like...

18:39.945 --> 18:42.146
The probability of chaos.

18:42.147 --> 18:45.086
You move me.

18:47.575 --> 18:49.617
You're playing a trick.

18:49.618 --> 18:51.339
No. I... What?

18:51.340 --> 18:53.096
What do you mean?

18:53.097 --> 18:54.377
I know you're spoken for.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.343
Herr Grossmann told me.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.482
About Marie.

18:59.483 --> 19:02.455
So this is, what, a little fun at my...

19:05.295 --> 19:07.337
Stop.

19:07.338 --> 19:08.774
But Marie, it's not... She's...

19:08.775 --> 19:09.955
It doesn't matter.

19:09.956 --> 19:11.711
I can't.

19:11.712 --> 19:13.650
This is not a possibility.

19:13.651 --> 19:15.345
But why not?

19:21.409 --> 19:22.845
EINSTEIN: <i>You both look ruddy.</i>

19:22.846 --> 19:24.154
<i>Seems the summer holiday</i>

19:24.155 --> 19:26.037
- has treated you well.
- In my mind,

19:26.038 --> 19:28.368
I'm still on a sailboat
with schnapps in hand.

19:28.369 --> 19:30.603
The Wintelers had
hoped to see you in Aarau.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.136
- Yes, well...
- Good Lord, Besso,

19:32.137 --> 19:33.223
if I closed my eyes,

19:33.224 --> 19:34.180
I could mistake you for my mother.

19:34.181 --> 19:35.264
Ah, finally.

19:35.265 --> 19:36.987
All summer long, I have been starved

19:36.988 --> 19:38.969
of your constant derision.
How ever did I survive?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.692
GROSSMANN: It is a mystery.

19:40.693 --> 19:43.629
Ah, Albert. I nearly forgot,
there's a book

19:43.630 --> 19:44.714
that you must read.

19:44.715 --> 19:46.821
Mach. <i>The Science of Mechanics.</i>

19:46.822 --> 19:48.738
He argues for the
reconsideration of Newton.

19:48.739 --> 19:49.761
Huh.

19:49.762 --> 19:50.882
- "Huh."
- Huh.

19:51.995 --> 19:53.670
The reconsideration of Newton.

19:53.671 --> 19:54.722
Are you listening?

19:54.723 --> 19:55.777
What?

19:55.778 --> 19:58.042
Dear God, he's an imposter.

19:58.043 --> 19:59.897
Quick, Grossmann,
send for the constable.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.046
(laughs)

20:01.047 --> 20:02.550
Welcome back, gentlemen.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.354
EINSTEIN: Sir?

20:05.355 --> 20:06.918
Sir, I was wondering,

20:06.919 --> 20:09.377
have you heard anything of Miss Maric?

20:09.378 --> 20:11.070
I thought you had no interest in her?

20:11.071 --> 20:14.358
I don't. I don't.
Or it is merely intellectual.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.615
She lent me a book.

20:15.616 --> 20:17.710
Well, if you must know,
she's auditing classes

20:17.711 --> 20:20.046
in Heidelberg and will
not be returning.

20:21.224 --> 20:23.457
Do you remember what we discussed?

20:23.458 --> 20:24.670
Attention and commitment.

20:24.671 --> 20:26.937
They will serve you well.

20:26.938 --> 20:28.952
Yes.

20:40.828 --> 20:42.842
Hey, Fritz, look.

20:46.192 --> 20:48.398
(laughter echoing)

20:49.927 --> 20:51.332
Cannot believe this.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.847
What is this girl doing in our class?

21:16.362 --> 21:19.908
TEACHER: Good morning, everyone.

21:21.407 --> 21:22.683
Good afternoon.

21:22.684 --> 21:25.045
My name is Professor Philipp Lenard.

21:25.046 --> 21:26.513
I'm pleased to welcome you

21:26.514 --> 21:29.643
to The Kinetic Principles
of Theoretical Physics.

21:29.644 --> 21:31.425
- Who is she?
- Over the course of the term,

21:31.426 --> 21:34.176
these lectures will explore a vast
yet infinitesimal universe.

21:34.177 --> 21:36.571
EINSTEIN: <i>My esteemed Miss Maric.</i>

21:36.572 --> 21:39.541

21:39.542 --> 21:43.564
<i>Do forgive me for the distress
I caused at our last meeting.</i>

21:43.565 --> 21:46.214
<i>I hoped I would be able
to apologize in person.</i>

21:46.215 --> 21:47.524
<i>But as I understand it,</i>

21:47.525 --> 21:49.597

21:49.598 --> 21:51.225
<i>If you find yourself bored,</i>

21:51.226 --> 21:54.674
<i>please write and share with
me why you chose to leave.</i>

21:54.675 --> 21:56.175
FRICKE: Fraulein.

21:56.176 --> 21:58.410
A letter's come.

21:58.411 --> 22:02.368
You really should find a man to
carry all those books for you.

22:02.369 --> 22:03.868
Thank you, Frau Fricke.

22:03.869 --> 22:05.884
Hmm.

22:16.003 --> 22:18.016
♪ ♪

22:41.865 --> 22:43.907
LENARD: Now, if these
molecules move with a velocity

22:43.908 --> 22:46.621
of over 400 meters per second,

22:46.622 --> 22:50.068
then, using these results,
we can determine

22:50.069 --> 22:51.665
that they travel no more

22:51.666 --> 22:54.282
than 1/100 of a hairsbreadth.

EINSTEIN: Why, say,

23:26.146 --> 23:28.317
heat flows and temperatures
are connected?

23:28.318 --> 23:30.202
Or-or different gases exert
different pressures?

23:30.203 --> 23:31.606
If we were to explore kinetic theory...

23:31.607 --> 23:33.874
Now, this is not an exploration.
It is a lecture.

23:33.875 --> 23:35.309
Pick up your pencil...

23:35.310 --> 23:36.459
Physics is dynamic!

23:36.460 --> 23:38.662
You see knowledge
as a baton to be passed,

23:38.663 --> 23:40.994
but scientific pursuit isn't a race.

23:40.995 --> 23:42.524
This should be an adventure!

23:42.525 --> 23:43.806
Herr Einstein, enough!

23:45.016 --> 23:47.442
Never, in all my years of teaching,

23:47.443 --> 23:49.933
have I seen such disrespect.
It will not be tolerated.

23:49.934 --> 23:51.306
Am I clear?

23:51.307 --> 23:53.285
There's no reason
to take this personally.

23:53.286 --> 23:55.105
It's the basis of
thermodynamics I'm questioning.

23:55.106 --> 23:56.828
Not you, Herr Weber.

23:56.829 --> 23:59.800
You will address me as Herr
Professor, you impudent twit!

24:01.427 --> 24:03.691
My apologies, Herr Professor,

24:03.692 --> 24:05.849
- but I don't understand...
- The laws of thermodynamics

24:05.850 --> 24:07.076
are observable and provable.

24:07.077 --> 24:08.546
There is nothing to question.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.298
Don't you find it fascinating
that even though

24:10.299 --> 24:11.419
these tiny molecules of gas

24:11.420 --> 24:14.037
move at a near incomprehensible speed,

24:14.038 --> 24:16.208
that they travel
hardly any distance at all.

24:16.209 --> 24:17.485
Not even a hairsbreadth.

24:17.486 --> 24:19.688
These radical thoughts are a disease.

24:19.689 --> 24:22.116
Who has infected you? Hmm?

24:22.117 --> 24:24.350
Is it Boltzmann? Mach?

24:24.351 --> 24:25.852
Lenard, actually.

24:25.853 --> 24:28.724
Miss Maric wrote to me about
one of his lectures and I...

24:28.725 --> 24:31.442
Again with this woman. Did I not
warn you that she was dangerous?

24:34.982 --> 24:38.622
Miss Maric has done
nothing but demonstrate

24:38.623 --> 24:41.336
her deep intelligence to you, and yet

24:41.337 --> 24:43.507
you treat her with disdain.

24:43.508 --> 24:46.604
I... what offense
has she ever given you?

24:46.605 --> 24:49.987
You are a very clever boy, Einstein.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.552
Very clever.

24:51.553 --> 24:52.993
But you have one fault.

24:54.585 --> 24:57.494
You will never let
yourself be told anything.

25:01.290 --> 25:02.539
Best of luck.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.592
That is clearly all I
have left to offer you.

25:08.252 --> 25:09.815
MARIE: <i>Is he angry with me?</i>

25:09.816 --> 25:11.409
Angry? Of course not.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.635
Albert's probably not even...

25:14.636 --> 25:16.073
Well, not even what?

25:16.074 --> 25:18.276
Oh, you know how he gets.

25:18.277 --> 25:19.809
Ah, you mean distracted?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.595
Yes.

25:21.596 --> 25:24.853
He's just consumed by
whatever's right in front of him.

25:24.854 --> 25:26.992
Mmm. It can be very charming.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.864
But also very frustrating.

25:29.865 --> 25:32.195
If it makes you feel better,
I haven't had a letter

25:32.196 --> 25:35.964
since he's been back in Zurich.
Not even a postcard.

25:35.965 --> 25:39.028
I just miss him, I suppose.

25:39.029 --> 25:40.592
I know.

25:40.593 --> 25:42.412
I bet he'd like some tea.

25:42.413 --> 25:43.946
Studying all those hours. Don't you?

25:43.947 --> 25:45.191
My brother

25:45.192 --> 25:47.266
has no idea how very lucky he is.

25:47.267 --> 25:50.139
(giggles) May I see this one, please?

25:50.140 --> 25:51.320
Of course, Fraulein.

25:51.321 --> 25:52.952
Thank you.

26:10.415 --> 26:13.004
(sighs)

26:24.493 --> 26:28.456
(playing violin)

26:30.433 --> 26:33.112
MILEVA: Herr Professor.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.347
If you'll permit me, my name is...

26:35.348 --> 26:36.976
Mileva Maric.

26:36.977 --> 26:38.604
One doesn't lose track

26:38.605 --> 26:40.201
of the sole woman in the room.

26:40.202 --> 26:42.404
Yes. Well,

26:42.405 --> 26:44.895
I've been trying to understand
equipartition theorem

26:44.896 --> 26:47.193
and if it applies to the case
of diatomic gases.

26:47.194 --> 26:49.109
How do I distribute the energy?

26:49.110 --> 26:50.864
As a matter of fact,
it does indeed apply,

26:50.865 --> 26:54.249
and you use the theorem in
exactly the same way as before.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.430
Uh, so then,

26:55.431 --> 26:57.251
you divide the energy equally,

26:57.252 --> 26:59.165
giving the rotational
and vibrational modes

26:59.166 --> 27:01.848
the same amount
as the translational ones?

27:01.849 --> 27:04.403
You have an impressive
command of this material.

27:04.404 --> 27:06.286
With whom else have you studied?

27:06.287 --> 27:08.872
On equipartition theorum?
Only you, sir.

27:08.873 --> 27:10.469
Though I did some
reading while studying

27:10.470 --> 27:11.970
at Polytechnic in Zurich.

27:11.971 --> 27:15.256
I found the instruction
on thermodynamics there...

27:15.257 --> 27:16.503
lacking.

27:16.504 --> 27:19.153
(chuckles) So you are here,

27:19.154 --> 27:21.292
auditing my lectures for...

27:21.293 --> 27:22.410
your enjoyment?

27:22.411 --> 27:24.390
No, sir. I mean, yes.

27:24.391 --> 27:26.591
I've enjoyed them very much, but...

27:26.592 --> 27:29.050
I've written an essay
on kinetic theory.

27:29.051 --> 27:31.412
I was hoping you might
make time to read it.

27:31.413 --> 27:33.041
And if you find it worthy,

27:33.042 --> 27:35.796
that you might write to the
administration on my behalf?

27:35.797 --> 27:38.830
I've petitioned to be allowed
to take the entrance exam.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.617
I admire your spirit, Fraulein,

27:40.618 --> 27:43.395
but the Swiss are much more
liberal than the Germans.

27:43.396 --> 27:44.959
Heidelberg does not, nor will not

27:44.960 --> 27:46.587
confer degrees on women.

27:46.588 --> 27:49.077
You should return to Zurich
and earn your diploma.

27:49.078 --> 27:50.515
After that,

27:50.516 --> 27:51.825
I might be willing to consider you

27:51.826 --> 27:53.612
for a research position, hmm?

27:53.613 --> 27:55.624
Thank you, but, sir...

27:55.625 --> 27:57.890
Please.

27:57.891 --> 27:59.807
I can't go back there.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.471
Why ever not?

28:04.691 --> 28:06.769
Emile.

28:08.555 --> 28:12.832
I-If you want to spend time
together in the library,

28:12.833 --> 28:13.950
I could help you study.

28:13.951 --> 28:17.144
Perhaps I'll take you up on that.

28:17.145 --> 28:20.530
Well, then, I'll see you tomorrow.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.829
(children laughing)

28:28.830 --> 28:30.843
(laughter grows louder)

28:33.809 --> 28:35.504
(children laughing loudly)

28:37.419 --> 28:40.805
(laughter echoes, fades)

28:55.809 --> 28:59.164
(men murmuring)

29:01.459 --> 29:03.857
FRICKE: Might we have ourselves a beau?

29:05.929 --> 29:08.966
Three letters from the same young man.

29:19.339 --> 29:21.188
EINSTEIN: <i>Congratulations.</i>

29:21.189 --> 29:22.626
Did it all go just as you'd planned it?

29:22.627 --> 29:24.413
BESSO: Well, she said yes,
which is all that matters.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.893
But, uh, we weren't able
to do much celebrating.

29:27.894 --> 29:29.618
EINSTEIN: Doesn't sound
like the Wintelers.

29:29.619 --> 29:33.128
No, but Anna puts Marie's
feelings above her own, so...

29:33.129 --> 29:34.365
EINSTEIN: I don't understand.

29:34.366 --> 29:35.705
Listen, Albert.

29:35.706 --> 29:37.397
I know that you're tired
of hearing this from me,

29:37.398 --> 29:39.664
and believe me,
I'm twice as tired of saying it.

29:39.665 --> 29:41.166
For the love of my soon-to-be marriage,

29:41.167 --> 29:42.602
will you please,

29:42.603 --> 29:44.838
please make your intentions
clear to that poor girl?

29:44.839 --> 29:46.114
I don't know what to say to her.

29:46.115 --> 29:48.093
Well you can't simply keep silent.

29:48.094 --> 29:51.861
Send her a letter, a thank you
for the gifts that she sends.

29:51.862 --> 29:53.841
I didn't ask her
for any of those things.

29:53.842 --> 29:55.470
Can you really be this thickheaded?

29:55.471 --> 29:57.485
Look, she's a wonderful person,
but I'm...

30:06.133 --> 30:07.921
BESSO: Albert?

30:07.922 --> 30:09.420
- (horses neighing)
- Hey!

30:09.421 --> 30:11.401
Watch where you're going, hey!

30:11.402 --> 30:12.618
Miss Maric!

30:13.509 --> 30:15.013
(horses snort)

30:23.407 --> 30:26.822
MILEVA: I didn't come back for you.

30:26.823 --> 30:28.896
If I could have earned
my degree in Heidelberg,

30:28.897 --> 30:30.751
I'd be there still.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.345
Stop.

30:35.346 --> 30:38.347
I am only here for my degree.

30:38.348 --> 30:40.262
I have so much catching up...

30:40.263 --> 30:42.501
papers, exams.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.682
Please.

30:49.683 --> 30:52.555
You're a distraction.

30:52.556 --> 30:55.428
I won't distract you. (sniffs)

30:55.429 --> 30:56.998
I'll help you.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.047
We'll catch up.

31:01.048 --> 31:03.603
Together.

31:03.604 --> 31:06.347
And what of Marie?

31:06.348 --> 31:08.585
There is only you.

31:11.297 --> 31:13.310
Mileva...

31:15.352 --> 31:18.320
I cannot get lost with you.

31:18.321 --> 31:21.417
We can discuss physics,

31:21.418 --> 31:25.060
geometry, but we cannot get lost.

31:30.229 --> 31:32.467
(whispering): Promise me.

31:34.285 --> 31:35.529
Promise me.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.002
I promise.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.740
You look just like a little doll.

32:11.588 --> 32:13.092
Stop.

32:16.346 --> 32:17.876
Your body's so soft,

32:17.877 --> 32:19.410
your face is so stern,

32:19.411 --> 32:22.251
just like a little porcelain doll.

32:22.252 --> 32:24.872
(laughs)

32:26.753 --> 32:28.509
I think that's what I'm gonna call you.

32:28.510 --> 32:30.110
My little Dollie.

32:33.523 --> 32:34.959
You think I look funny?

32:34.960 --> 32:37.578
No. Why would you...?

32:37.579 --> 32:38.789
This is not a joke to me.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.780
Hey, I wasn't...

32:39.781 --> 32:41.760
You were.

32:41.761 --> 32:44.313
Hear me, Albert. If this is just...

32:44.314 --> 32:46.963
shaking the sheets for you,
then you must let me be.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.404
Oh, Mileva.

32:50.923 --> 32:52.551
Can't you see?

32:52.552 --> 32:56.769
I'm head over heels in
love with your mind.

33:08.897 --> 33:11.068
- (knocking at door)
- GROSSMANN: Albert, you coming?

33:11.069 --> 33:12.633
Go away.

33:12.634 --> 33:14.292
Wait, what time is it?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.624
What is time?
That is the real question.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.602
Albert, be serious,
we're late for class.

33:18.603 --> 33:20.294
What does it matter? I told you,

33:20.295 --> 33:22.051
I'll help you catch up. Besides,

33:22.052 --> 33:25.021
attendance isn't required,
only that we pass the exams.

33:25.022 --> 33:27.159
It may not be required,
but it's certainly expected

33:27.160 --> 33:29.074
and I cannot fall below expectations.

33:29.075 --> 33:29.777
Hey,

33:29.778 --> 33:32.780
such expectations are for small minds.

33:32.781 --> 33:36.099
For men like Weber,
who are slaves to convention.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.015
Men without creativity or vision.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.729
I am not a man.

33:40.730 --> 33:43.479
Thank God for that.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.790
It's months before exams.

33:52.383 --> 33:54.109
What's one more morning?

34:05.026 --> 34:06.333
MILEVA: Shall I brew more?

34:06.334 --> 34:09.047
It's still warm and it's been a while.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.538
Well, the law of cooling
is a decaying exponential,

34:11.539 --> 34:12.911
but you need a
measurement on the liquid

34:12.911 --> 34:14.411
to get the heat transfer coefficient.

34:14.413 --> 34:16.040
Don't worry about
the measurement for now.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.605
We'll find a new way to think about it.

34:17.606 --> 34:18.628
All right, so

34:18.629 --> 34:20.319
forget the tea entirely.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.703
What if we thought of
molecules like people?

34:23.704 --> 34:24.789
Yes!

34:24.790 --> 34:25.842
Moving at impossible speeds,

34:25.844 --> 34:26.864
bumping in to one another.

34:26.864 --> 34:27.853
And the amount

34:27.855 --> 34:29.578
of pressure people feel
can be understood

34:29.579 --> 34:31.206
- by how frequently these bumps happen.
- (strums violin)

34:31.208 --> 34:32.612
- More people...
- (strums violin)

34:32.612 --> 34:33.920
- more pressure.
- No, not necessarily.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.964
How big is the room?

34:35.965 --> 34:38.262
Say they're crammed
into a crowded hallway.

34:38.263 --> 34:39.732
Jostling and bumping, late for class.

34:39.733 --> 34:41.647
(children laughing)

34:41.648 --> 34:43.242
EINSTEIN: <i>High pressure, yes?</i>

34:43.243 --> 34:46.150
(children laughing)

34:58.952 --> 35:00.453
EINSTEIN: <i>Mileva?</i>

35:00.454 --> 35:02.719
Are you all right?

35:02.720 --> 35:04.478
I am.

35:06.008 --> 35:08.210
Now let's place them
in a grand ballroom.

35:08.211 --> 35:09.903
- (waltz music playing)
- <i>The same people,</i>

35:09.904 --> 35:12.744
<i>no more, no less.</i>

35:12.745 --> 35:16.895
<i>Only now, ten times the size.</i>

35:16.896 --> 35:20.726
<i>Enough to dance freely around the room.</i>

35:20.727 --> 35:21.843
EINSTEIN: <i>More volume....</i>

35:21.844 --> 35:23.440
MILEVA: <i>Fewer collisions...</i>

35:23.441 --> 35:25.196
BOTH: <i>Lower pressure.</i>

35:45.629 --> 35:46.779
just a new way of seeing it.

35:46.780 --> 35:48.151
What if this is the way to prove

35:48.152 --> 35:49.561
the existence of molecules?

35:50.705 --> 35:52.110
Doesn't it sound like fun, Dollie?

35:52.111 --> 35:54.025
You and me writing a paper

35:54.026 --> 35:55.367
that could change the world.

35:55.368 --> 35:56.835
The probability of chaos.

35:56.836 --> 35:59.995
(chuckles) Not the title
I would choose, but...

35:59.996 --> 36:01.560
we can discuss it.

36:01.561 --> 36:02.869
PERNET: I tried to tell you,

36:02.870 --> 36:04.881
Einstein's like all the other Jews...

36:04.882 --> 36:07.755
obnoxious and self-aggrandizing.

36:07.756 --> 36:10.628
Oh, apologies, Hermann.

36:10.629 --> 36:13.278
You've always been an exception.

36:13.279 --> 36:15.641
Oh, why, thank you.

36:15.642 --> 36:17.627
I made every effort to act as a mentor

36:17.628 --> 36:18.546
to that young man.

36:18.547 --> 36:19.918
Fail him if you must.

36:19.919 --> 36:22.472
I am no longer concerned for his future.

36:22.473 --> 36:25.411
PERNET: I'll draft
a letter of reprimand.

36:25.412 --> 36:27.645
MILEVA: The mean kinetic
energy is always the same,

36:27.646 --> 36:30.327
whether its atoms are
chemically bound or not.

36:30.328 --> 36:33.552
Hence, equal increments
of mean kinetic energy

36:33.553 --> 36:37.640
correspond to equal
increments of temperature.

36:37.641 --> 36:40.900
And the specific heat is...

36:45.175 --> 36:47.701
Something wrong?

36:51.879 --> 36:54.021
Not a single thing.

37:07.715 --> 37:10.652
Isn't it a miracle, Dollie?

37:10.653 --> 37:15.281
So many of us, millions and millions.

37:15.282 --> 37:17.292
How ever did we find each other?

37:17.293 --> 37:20.899
WEBER: <i>We are a mere month
from your final exams.</i>

37:20.900 --> 37:22.881
Your performance will
determine your future.

37:22.882 --> 37:25.976
Every single one of you has
the ability to succeed.

37:25.977 --> 37:26.966
Have you seen Albert?

37:26.967 --> 37:29.227
But do you have the
will, the commitment?

37:32.364 --> 37:34.151
Good morning, dear Dollie.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.974
Good morning.

37:37.153 --> 37:41.013
I had the most wonderful
dream last night.

37:41.014 --> 37:43.219
We were dancing along the string

37:43.220 --> 37:45.234
of my violin.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.987
And I woke up with this thought.

37:49.988 --> 37:53.161
What if the properties
of different gases

37:53.162 --> 37:55.202
are just like the different timbres

37:55.203 --> 37:57.054
of musical instruments?

37:57.055 --> 38:00.248
All accounted for by their
different molecular makeup.

38:00.249 --> 38:02.706
That's thrilling.

38:02.707 --> 38:03.855
Isn't it, though?

38:03.856 --> 38:05.520
Back in the blink of an eye.

38:07.049 --> 38:09.506
Make us some tea, Dollie.

38:09.507 --> 38:11.522
(chuckles)

38:32.559 --> 38:35.532
♪ ♪

38:49.258 --> 38:51.271
(humming)

38:55.227 --> 38:56.535
- Liar!
- Dollie, what... what...

38:56.536 --> 38:58.295
Do not call me that!

38:59.921 --> 39:01.930
"My dearest Albert,

39:01.931 --> 39:04.903
I hope you're still
enjoying the teapot."

39:07.456 --> 39:09.529
You promised me!

39:09.530 --> 39:11.893
But you haven't supported my studies.

39:11.894 --> 39:14.701
You haven't helped me catch up.

39:14.702 --> 39:16.202
You've siphoned my time,

39:16.203 --> 39:18.214
my thoughts, my energy,

39:18.215 --> 39:19.683
all for your own gain.

39:19.684 --> 39:23.035
How could you be so
careless with my heart?!

39:23.036 --> 39:24.598
- But I... I have...
- Stop!

39:24.599 --> 39:26.610
Let me explain, please.

39:26.611 --> 39:28.367
You only cared about yourself.

39:28.368 --> 39:32.164
You haven't even tried
to understand me.

39:32.165 --> 39:35.295
- How hard I must work.
- No.

39:35.296 --> 39:37.849
How tireless I must be.

39:37.850 --> 39:39.381
How strong and cold

39:39.382 --> 39:41.106
to have the slimmest hope

39:41.107 --> 39:44.011
of being taken seriously.

39:44.012 --> 39:47.108
To be given an ounce of the respect

39:47.109 --> 39:49.918
you receive instantly
by virtue of your manhood!

39:49.919 --> 39:51.034
Mileva, please...

39:51.035 --> 39:53.877
No! I knew...

39:53.878 --> 39:58.219
I <i>knew</i> this would happen.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.010
What an idiot I am!

40:02.338 --> 40:05.882
We've got mere weeks until the exams.

40:05.883 --> 40:07.447
Mileva...

40:07.448 --> 40:08.755
I'm crazy.

40:08.756 --> 40:09.812
No.

40:10.959 --> 40:12.714
You've made me crazy!

40:12.715 --> 40:14.311
No.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.801
- Mileva, please...
- Do not...

40:16.802 --> 40:19.551
speak to me <i>ever</i> again.

40:21.655 --> 40:23.605
Wait.

40:33.755 --> 40:35.895
If a curved surface is developed

40:35.896 --> 40:39.055
on any other surface whatever,

40:39.056 --> 40:41.321
the degree of curvature in each point

40:41.322 --> 40:42.822
remains unchanged.

40:42.823 --> 40:45.537
(echoing): This "Theorema
Egregium" from Gauss

40:45.538 --> 40:49.053
has had a significant
impact on cartography...

40:57.988 --> 40:59.327
BESSO: Miss Maric.

40:59.328 --> 41:02.648
Are you all right?

41:02.649 --> 41:06.644
Is there anything
that I can do for you?

41:09.066 --> 41:11.081
(clock ticking)

41:13.664 --> 41:15.228
Not at all.

41:15.229 --> 41:17.404
Good day.

41:35.152 --> 41:37.543
EINSTEIN: <i>My dear Frau Winteler.</i>

41:37.544 --> 41:40.321
<i>It is with a heavy heart I write</i>

41:40.322 --> 41:42.462
<i>and ask you to share
my thoughts and feelings</i>

41:42.463 --> 41:45.748
<i>with your dearest, Marie.</i>

41:45.749 --> 41:49.932
<i>She deserves more
attention than I have to give.</i>

41:49.933 --> 41:52.486
<i>My studies consume
all my time and thought.</i>

41:52.487 --> 41:55.072
<i>And I fear I have already
caused the dear child</i>

41:55.073 --> 41:56.828
<i>too much pain.</i>

41:56.829 --> 42:00.691
<i>Please make sure she understands.</i>

42:00.692 --> 42:02.863
(crying)

42:02.864 --> 42:07.555
<i>I hope she, and you all,
can forgive me.</i>

42:07.556 --> 42:09.218
(knocking on door)

42:11.866 --> 42:13.793
I need your notes.
Geometry, the last two terms.

42:13.794 --> 42:15.921
(laughs) I was wondering when
you would pull your head out

42:15.922 --> 42:17.230
from between the gimp's thighs.

42:17.231 --> 42:18.985
Do not speak of her that way.

42:18.986 --> 42:20.965
Of course.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.626
My apologies.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.023
I'll get them now.

42:37.793 --> 42:39.547
You were right.

42:39.548 --> 42:41.527
I was careless.

42:41.528 --> 42:44.815
It really has been over
with Marie for some time,

42:44.816 --> 42:47.306
but... I just...

42:47.307 --> 42:49.061
I didn't want to hurt her,

42:49.062 --> 42:53.691
so I... didn't say anything at all.

42:53.692 --> 42:54.712
But it's done now.

42:54.713 --> 42:57.585
I've made it clear. And...

42:57.586 --> 43:00.842
as unfair as I was to her, I've been

43:00.843 --> 43:03.236
ten times more so to you. I was...

43:03.237 --> 43:05.568
I've been horrid and selfish

43:05.569 --> 43:08.604
and you're right to want
nothing more to do with me.

43:11.476 --> 43:13.071
Those are Marcel's notes.

43:13.072 --> 43:14.986
The last two terms.

43:14.987 --> 43:17.540
I copied them for you.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.779
They're yours to keep.

43:20.670 --> 43:22.585
I hope...

43:22.586 --> 43:27.279
they will undo some of the
damage that I have done.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.674
And...

43:29.675 --> 43:32.067
if you would like my help,

43:32.068 --> 43:36.155
then I would love nothing
more than to give it.

43:36.156 --> 43:38.457
I ask for nothing in return.

43:47.808 --> 43:49.759
Sit down.

44:01.538 --> 44:04.059
WEBER: <i>It has been a pleasure having</i>

44:04.060 --> 44:07.123
all you gentlemen in class.

44:07.124 --> 44:08.976
I wish you the best.

44:08.977 --> 44:10.385
You may begin.

44:22.738 --> 44:25.068
(bell tolling)

44:25.069 --> 44:27.335
EINSTEIN: <i>I know I said</i>

44:27.336 --> 44:29.791
I wouldn't ask you for anything.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.762
And what I'm about to say
may sound like I am, so...

44:32.763 --> 44:34.331
This is just an offer.

44:37.041 --> 44:39.754
Be my partner.

44:39.755 --> 44:42.628
In life, in love,

44:42.629 --> 44:44.926
in endless scientific pursuit.

44:44.927 --> 44:48.597
Let's build a beautiful
bohemian existence together.

44:48.598 --> 44:50.129
I don't know what that means.

44:50.130 --> 44:51.088
You do.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.269
We had it.

44:52.270 --> 44:54.026
It was... it was perfect.

44:54.027 --> 44:55.941
But it can't stay that way.

44:55.942 --> 44:59.005
You and I, alone, together, we fit,

44:59.006 --> 45:00.921
like pencils in the box.

45:00.922 --> 45:03.571
But out in the world,
it's nothing but endless...

45:03.572 --> 45:07.082
possibilities for us to crash
into things. Irreversibly.

45:07.083 --> 45:09.159
People are not molecules, Mileva.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.234
Please... when I'm not with you,

45:11.235 --> 45:13.151
I feel as if I'm not whole.

45:13.152 --> 45:16.694
Let's remain students
as long as we live.

45:16.695 --> 45:19.027
Alone. Together.

45:21.930 --> 45:23.208
WEBER: Herr Einstein.

45:23.209 --> 45:25.124
- Congratulations.
- Sir?

45:25.125 --> 45:27.580
The results will be posted shortly,

45:27.581 --> 45:28.921
but you passed your exams.

45:28.922 --> 45:32.146
By the skin of your teeth, of course.

45:32.147 --> 45:33.746
Good day.

45:38.981 --> 45:40.612
Dollie.

Miza!

46:15.588 --> 46:16.896
Hello, Papa.

46:16.897 --> 46:18.301
So wonderful to see you.

46:18.302 --> 46:20.316
- I've missed you, too.
- Did you?

46:22.900 --> 46:25.994
Your mother and I were beginning
to worry you'd never come home.

46:25.995 --> 46:27.687
In all your letters,
you never explained

46:27.688 --> 46:29.825
what has kept you these months.

46:29.826 --> 46:33.434
I'm so sorry, Papa.

46:33.435 --> 46:35.348
I failed you.

46:35.349 --> 46:36.849
Your exams?

46:36.850 --> 46:38.127
You'll go back.

46:38.128 --> 46:40.202
You'll try again.

46:40.203 --> 46:43.012
Was this why you stayed away?

46:43.013 --> 46:44.192
No.

46:44.193 --> 46:45.947
I...

46:45.948 --> 46:48.823
- I don't know how to...
- Mileva Maric,

46:48.824 --> 46:51.477
come here this instant.

46:52.367 --> 46:54.764
(exhales)

46:59.328 --> 47:01.945
I'm so sorry, Papa.

47:01.946 --> 47:04.503
I'm so sorry.
